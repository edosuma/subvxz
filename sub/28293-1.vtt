<i>I see it everyday.</i>

01:12.656 --> 01:14.282
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>The illusion of love.</i>

01:14.282 --> 01:16.201
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
You would be surprised

01:14.282 --> 01:16.201
at the percentage of...

01:16.201 --> 01:19.997
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>I see the ones who will</i>

01:16.201 --> 01:19.997
<i>start being disappointed.</i>

01:19.997 --> 01:23.584
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>The ones smack in the middle</i>

01:19.997 --> 01:23.584
<i>of disappointment.</i>

01:23.584 --> 01:26.294
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>The ones making an effort</i>

01:23.584 --> 01:26.294
<i>not to be disappointed.</i>

01:28.129 --> 01:30.674
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>It's part of my job</i>

01:28.129 --> 01:30.674

[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>Sex, family...</i>

01:37.514 --> 01:38.807
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>You learn a lot.</i>

01:38.807 --> 01:41.100
Okay, everything
looks fine.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.645
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>Take her, for instance...</i>

01:43.645 --> 01:45.146
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>do you know where the</i>

01:43.645 --> 01:45.146

01:46.147 --> 01:49.109
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>Neither does she.</i>

01:46.147 --> 01:49.109
...looking good,
which is great.

01:50.151 --> 01:53.488
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>She waited years for the</i>

[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>And these two look adorable,</i>

01:57.993 --> 01:59.703
<i>don't they?</i>

02:02.915 --> 02:03.958
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>Not so much, no.</i>

02:07.044 --> 02:12.007
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>So many people fundamentally</i>

02:07.044 --> 02:12.007
<i>mistaken about their lives.</i>

02:12.007 --> 02:15.761
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>Chasing after the fairy-tale,</i>

02:12.007 --> 02:15.761
<i>settling for what they can get.</i>

02:15.761 --> 02:16.804
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>It's exhausting.</i>

02:19.014 --> 02:22.017
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>Because they can't admit </i>

02:19.014 --> 02:22.017
<i>one simple, devastating truth:</i>

02:22.017 --> 02:24.770
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>Love, actual love...</i>

02:24.770 --> 02:27.439
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>is, at best, improbable.</i>

02:28.107 --> 02:30.191
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>It's not meant for everyone.</i>

02:30.191 --> 02:32.360
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>It is the privilege of some</i>

02:30.191 --> 02:32.360
<i>lucky few.</i>

02:32.360 --> 02:35.906
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>And if you find it,</i>

02:32.360 --> 02:35.906
<i>you'll end up losing it.</i>

02:37.532 --> 02:40.661
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>So it's better if you accept the</i>

02:37.532 --> 02:40.661

02:40.661 --> 02:42.370
Were you waiting
for someone here?

02:42.370 --> 02:43.789
Uh, no. Sure. Sit down.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.666
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>Learn to make it quick.</i>

02:47.208 --> 02:49.044
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>Learn to make it fun.</i>

02:50.378 --> 02:54.633
[Clara narrating in Spanish]
<i>Just learn to love that it ends</i>

02:50.378 --> 02:54.633

02:55.509 --> 02:57.427
-Okay.
-Okay.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.304
Okay. Oh.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.555
Wow.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.060
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.185
What? What?

03:10.065 --> 03:12.233
I love you.

-Okay?

05:33.541 --> 05:36.586
giving you a key?

05:36.586 --> 05:37.587
[in Spanish]
How do I look?

05:37.587 --> 05:38.922
[mom] Hmm?

05:38.922 --> 05:40.381
[in Spanish]
You're wearing white?

05:40.381 --> 05:41.967
[in Spanish]
Of course.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.384
[in Spanish]
The priest will not approve.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.262
[in Spanish]
On the contrary, he loved it.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.388
[in Spanish]
Is that Clara? What'd she think?

05:47.388 --> 05:49.599
[in Spanish]
She's shocked it's white.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.725
-[in Spanish] I mean...
-[in Spanish] Yep.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.602
[in Spanish]
What did Dad say?

05:52.602 --> 05:54.562
[in Spanish]
Nothing. He can't see it

05:52.602 --> 05:54.562
yet, it's bad luck.

05:54.562 --> 05:58.317
[in Spanish]
Come on! You've already

05:54.562 --> 05:58.317
lived together for forty years.

05:58.317 --> 06:00.277
[in Spanish]
But now they suddenly

05:58.317 --> 06:00.277
believe in marriage.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.903
[in Spanish]
Remember when you got married?

06:01.903 --> 06:05.032
[in Spanish]
We don't need belief, we have

06:01.903 --> 06:05.032
empirical proof.

06:06.407 --> 06:10.287
[in Spanish]
Your grandpa would be so

06:06.407 --> 06:10.287
happy to see me finally
getting married...

06:10.287 --> 06:11.955
[in Spanish]
by a priest and everything.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.708
[in Spanish]
He died so scared you

06:11.955 --> 06:14.708
both were going to hell...

06:14.708 --> 06:16.751
[in Spanish]
...for being born

06:14.708 --> 06:16.751
out of wedlock.

06:16.751 --> 06:20.421
[in Spanish]
No worries, we can still go to

06:16.751 --> 06:20.421
hell for some other things.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.007
Ay!

06:22.007 --> 06:24.218
[in Spanish]
Go take a shower,

06:22.007 --> 06:24.218
you smell like frat house.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.260
[in Spanish]
Yummy!

06:27.554 --> 06:28.722
[in Spanish]
And we have a fitting

06:27.554 --> 06:28.722
for your bridesmaid dress.
That's why I came to L.A.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.932
[in Spanish]
I can't, I have a consult

06:28.722 --> 06:30.932
and a due date.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.060
[in Spanish]
It's Saturday.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.728
[in Spanish]
Some babies are born

06:33.060 --> 06:34.728
on a Saturday...

06:34.728 --> 06:36.897
[in Spanish]
It's like they don't even care

06:34.728 --> 06:36.897
about my weekend.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.481
[in Spanish]
Hey!

06:40.108 --> 06:41.651
[in Spanish]
Where did you sleep?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.651
[in Spanish]
I was out last night

06:41.651 --> 06:44.445
[in Spanish]
and stayed out. I didn't know

06:41.651 --> 06:44.445
you planned to ambush me

06:44.445 --> 06:45.446
[in Spanish]
with mom and white ruffles.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.824
[in Spanish]
You were out naked?

06:47.824 --> 06:49.450
[in Spanish]
Not initially,

06:47.824 --> 06:49.450
it developed that way.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.328
[laughs]

06:52.662 --> 06:55.832
[in Spanish]
I can't believe our parents are

06:52.662 --> 06:55.832
getting married before you do.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.459
[in Spanish]
That's usually how it goes,

06:55.832 --> 06:58.459
they're the weird ones.

06:58.459 --> 07:01.796
[in Spanish]
I also can't believe

06:58.459 --> 07:01.796
that a woman with your
mind and your legs

07:01.796 --> 07:05.633
[in Spanish]
can't scare up a date for the

07:01.796 --> 07:05.633
wedding. Yesterday's guy
wasn't good even for that?

07:06.927 --> 07:10.722
[in Spanish]
Yesterday's guy was barely good

07:06.927 --> 07:10.722
for what I wanted him for
yesterday.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.558
[in Spanish]
You can't keep sleeping with men

07:10.722 --> 07:13.558
you don't want to see again,

07:13.558 --> 07:15.394
[in Spanish]
even to get your clothes back.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.562
[in Spanish]
There's not much left to see.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.480
[in Spanish]
Specially if you're

07:17.562 --> 07:19.480
out the door at dawn.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.192
[in Spanish]
I've been in love.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.192
I know what it is.

07:22.192 --> 07:25.404
[in Spanish]
So I can easily

07:22.192 --> 07:25.404
recognize what it is.

07:25.404 --> 07:26.905
[in Spanish]
It's been a million years, sis.

07:28.489 --> 07:29.449
[in Spanish]
Eight.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.912
[both in Spanish]
-You have to give it a chance.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.912
-Why?

07:33.912 --> 07:36.957
[in Spanish]
Because I'm old and should

07:33.912 --> 07:36.957
start thinking about settling?
[in Spanish]

07:37.582 --> 07:40.627
Because you need someone
to go places with.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.504
[in Spanish]
Get a move on, otherwise

07:40.627 --> 07:43.504
the bride won't be happy.

07:43.504 --> 07:46.507
[in Spanish]
until she sets you up with

07:43.504 --> 07:46.507
one of the Guadalajara cousins.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.469
[in Spanish]
And they're the hands-on

07:46.507 --> 07:49.469
side of the family.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.307
[in Spanish]
Just find someone pretty.

07:53.514 --> 07:57.560
[in Spanish]
And if he's Mexican, she'll

07:53.514 --> 07:57.560
count it as her wedding gift.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.604
[in Spanish]
Someone pretty and Mexican...

08:00.855 --> 08:01.898
[in Spanish]
...I can do that.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.526
[in Spanish]
Push, push, push!

08:03.400 --> 08:05.526
[baby crying]
Okay!

08:05.526 --> 08:07.487
There we go!

08:07.737 --> 08:09.323
[in Spanish]
Thanks!

08:09.323 --> 08:11.032
[in Spanish]
Congratulations.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.032
Well done!

08:11.032 --> 08:12.533
[both in Spanish]
-Is he ok?

08:11.032 --> 08:12.533
-He's fine.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.161
[in Spanish]
He's great.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.161
Okay.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.705
The brand-new
baby boy, huh?

08:17.705 --> 08:20.167
Congratulations!

08:20.167 --> 08:22.294
[murmuring]

08:27.548 --> 08:31.261
[siren wailing]

08:31.261 --> 08:32.553
[knocks]

08:32.553 --> 08:35.556
Hmm? What?

08:35.556 --> 08:38.143
I'm just here to pick up
the charts for Leslie.

08:38.143 --> 08:41.355
I was just in the room
with you and Mrs. Pecanzas.

08:41.355 --> 08:44.274
-I know. Mm-hmm.
-The delivery room.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.233
Thanks.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.568
What'd your boyfriend do?

08:47.568 --> 08:49.570
Hmm? Excuse me?

08:49.570 --> 08:51.031
Uh, or girlfriend. It's--

08:51.031 --> 08:53.283
Well, someone has sent
you a million flowers.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.994
They must've done something.
It's the... arrangements.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.579
Right. Yeah. Uh... no.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.914
No, no boyfriend.

08:59.914 --> 09:03.584
No, these are
sample centerpieces

08:59.914 --> 09:03.584
for my parents' wedding.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.586
Yeah, I have to pick one.

09:05.586 --> 09:08.048
Maid of honor.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.008
They're renewing
their vows?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.008
That's great.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.593
No, no. Brand-new vows.
Yeah, they never got married.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.304
They were hippies
in the '70s,

09:14.304 --> 09:16.806
and now that they've been
happy and together

09:16.806 --> 09:20.227
for 40 years, they need
fresh, new ways to...

09:20.227 --> 09:23.104
rub it in.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.607
I'm sorry.

09:26.607 --> 09:27.608
No, it's--!

09:27.608 --> 09:29.610
Mm! Yeah.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.863
[laughs] Hmm.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.907
You're pretty.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.034
Excuse me?

09:37.618 --> 09:39.579
Are you Mexican in any way?

09:42.623 --> 09:45.626
[Clara] Ay yi yi.
We're so late.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.837
[Clara] We are<i> so</i> late.
[Asher] It's okay.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.923
My mom's gonna kill me.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.929
Oh, no, you
don't need that.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.972
We're crossing
an international border.

09:57.972 --> 10:01.642
Oh, yeah, I know.
You're gonna need that

09:57.972 --> 10:01.642
on the way back, but...

10:01.642 --> 10:04.645
So, they don't care who comes--
But we could be anybody.

10:04.645 --> 10:07.648
No. They can sense
that you're

10:04.645 --> 10:07.648
a harmless soul.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.151
Yeah, I mean, and that's
very accurate of them. I am.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.571
But, you, on the other hand,
you could be...

10:12.571 --> 10:14.406
What is-- Come on!

10:19.453 --> 10:20.661
[both in Spanish]
-Good afternoon.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.661
-Hi.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.497
[both in Spanish]
-Something to declare?

10:20.661 --> 10:22.497
-No.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.166
[in Spanish]
Go ahead.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.502
Oh, hey. Yeah.
It's fine.

10:27.502 --> 10:30.464
Thanks. Thanks.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.924
And thanks for coming,
by the way.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.218
Thank you
for inviting me.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.681
<i>Listo.</i>
I'm driving

10:40.681 --> 10:42.683
on the way back.

10:42.683 --> 10:46.020
[graceful music]

10:52.819 --> 10:54.695
Wow!

10:54.695 --> 10:55.822
That's, uh...

10:55.822 --> 10:58.116
That's one hell
of a view! Look at that.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.285
Yeah, I bet you don't
have this in Australia, huh?

11:00.285 --> 11:04.289
We do, it's just, like--
It's nice to see what comes

11:00.285 --> 11:04.289
second, you know?

11:33.401 --> 11:34.693
[keys clatter]
Oh!

11:37.447 --> 11:39.907
Um, oh, uh,
what's the name, again?

11:39.907 --> 11:41.451
-Jacinta.
-Jacinta.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.702
Yeah, your
grandmother's name

11:41.451 --> 11:43.702
was Jacinta.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.539
-Uh-huh.
-And she was born in Sonora.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.081
-Sonora.
-And she-- Oh! Okay.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.707
-Easy, easy.
-She, uh...

11:48.707 --> 11:49.917
met an Aussie
in Texas.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.752
Aussie in Tex--
Right, right. Okay.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.754
We can give her
an easier name, if you like.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.006
Can you handle Maria?

11:55.006 --> 11:56.508
Please, be more
condescending

11:56.508 --> 11:58.759
while you're making
ridiculous requests.

11:58.759 --> 11:59.802
-Oh!
-Come on.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.929
-Can you help me with that?
-Yeah. Yeah.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.349
What?

12:04.349 --> 12:05.559
Nothing.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.726
No, you're just
a remarkable ugly woman.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.400
-Aunt Clarie!
-Bobs!

12:13.400 --> 12:15.151
So nice
to see you again!

12:16.361 --> 12:18.238
-Oh, you brought a date!
-Yep.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.657
-Mama's gonna be thrilled!
-What's up, man?

12:24.785 --> 12:26.996
This is not
gonna go off.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.915
It will go off.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.791
[in Spanish]
We don't want that

12:28.915 --> 12:30.791
defeatist attitude, kid.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.043
Okay, here we go.
Big breath.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.127
[sucking in]

12:33.127 --> 12:35.088
Yup. Ee! Yay!

12:35.088 --> 12:36.423
Oh, thank you.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.341
[in Spanish]
Hello.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.927
[in Spanish]
God, I hate you so much!

12:38.341 --> 12:40.927
You look gorgeous!

12:42.596 --> 12:43.388
[in Spanish]
Wait, no...

12:43.388 --> 12:44.639
[in Spanish]
I vote out.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.307
[Both in Spanish]
-Yeah?

12:44.639 --> 12:46.307
-Yeah.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.518
[in Spanish]
Okay.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.563
Ahem. Hello!

12:51.563 --> 12:52.813
Hi.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.190
[in Spanish]
He's not Mexican.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.360
No, but he has
a Mexican grandmother

12:54.190 --> 12:57.360
named Jacinta.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.112
Jacinta, yes, I did.
That's right.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.988
[laughing]
Yeah.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.490
First few times
I met the family,

13:02.490 --> 13:04.534
I had a Mexican grandmother,
Timothea.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.745
-Yes!
-I miss her very much.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.996
[in Spanish]
He's kinda pretty.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.541
[in Spanish]
Thanks. So are you.

13:11.874 --> 13:15.420
No fair, Dad. When will
you learn to speak Spanish

13:11.874 --> 13:15.420
like him?

13:15.420 --> 13:18.131
As soon as your mom
starts fasting

13:15.420 --> 13:18.131
on Yom Kippur.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.800
[gentle music]

13:25.972 --> 13:28.015
[in Spanish]
Good luck, Dad.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.393
[in Spanish]
This is backwards, isn't it?

13:30.393 --> 13:33.020
[laughs]

13:33.020 --> 13:36.149
[both murmuring]

13:59.880 --> 14:02.883
[in Spanish]
I, Eva, take you, Francisco...

14:02.883 --> 14:06.887
[in Spanish]
to be my husband, because...

14:06.887 --> 14:11.892
[in Spanish]
well, you're my best friend. And

14:06.887 --> 14:11.892
look at everything we've built
together.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.687
[in Spanish]
This house.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.064
[in Spanish]
Our gorgeous daughters.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.359
[in Spanish]
And everything is perfect,

14:19.359 --> 14:22.945
[in Spanish]
because you had something

14:19.359 --> 14:22.945
to do with it.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.824
[in Spanish]
Mrs. Barren, I love

14:22.945 --> 14:25.824
you so much...

14:25.824 --> 14:28.909
[in Spanish]
we've had a good long run.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.830
[in Spanish]
I'm delighted we're now ruining

14:28.909 --> 14:31.830
it with marriage.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.247
[light laughter]

14:33.665 --> 14:35.542
[in Spanish]
May we have the rings, please?

15:09.784 --> 15:13.120
[soft jazz]

15:13.120 --> 15:16.708
[kids screaming]

15:20.336 --> 15:24.382
[in Spanish]
So here's to having an official

15:20.336 --> 15:24.382
document that states we're not
bastards.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.430
[in Spanish]
That bad?

15:31.681 --> 15:36.895
[female singing
in Spanish]

15:50.074 --> 15:51.158
[in Spanish]
Daniel?

15:51.158 --> 15:53.119
Ee!

15:53.119 --> 15:57.582
[in Spanish]
It's a pleasure to see you

15:53.119 --> 15:57.582
again! I cannot believe you're
here, kid!

15:57.582 --> 15:58.999
[in Spanish]
Likewise.

15:57.582 --> 15:58.999
You too.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.961
[both in Spanish]
-Daniel, welcome!

15:58.999 --> 16:01.961
-Congratulations!

16:03.045 --> 16:06.299
You wanna make
a run for it?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.510
-Yes. Yes.
-Yeah?

16:09.510 --> 16:10.344
Right.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.597
Glad to see you, too.

16:12.597 --> 16:13.640
[in Spanish]
Clara!

16:16.016 --> 16:17.059
[in Spanish]
Clara!

16:18.185 --> 16:19.479
[in Spanish]
Daniel?

16:18.185 --> 16:19.479
Hey!

16:19.479 --> 16:20.980
[in Spanish]
Daniel!

16:21.021 --> 16:25.401
[in Spanish]
Hey! What are you--?

16:21.021 --> 16:25.401
What are you doing here?

16:25.401 --> 16:26.986
[in Spanish]
Here you are.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.488
[in Spanish]
I saw the announcement

16:26.986 --> 16:28.488
on Eva's Facebook and...

16:28.488 --> 16:30.030
[in Spanish]
I had to come.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.574
[both in Spanish]
-I'm sorry.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.574
-No, no.

16:31.574 --> 16:35.411
[in Spanish]
I couldn't send you an

16:31.574 --> 16:35.411
invitation, your email bounced.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.037
[in Spanish]
Yeah... I figured.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.123
[in Spanish]
Did you? Right...

16:39.123 --> 16:41.167
[in Spanish]
You didn't figure maybe

16:39.123 --> 16:41.167
I didn't want you here?

16:43.461 --> 16:44.420
[in Spanish]
So...

16:46.130 --> 16:47.674
[in Spanish]
when did you get back?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.674
Last time Abby heard from you,

16:47.674 --> 16:50.426
[in Spanish]
-you were in Yucatán, right?

16:47.674 --> 16:50.426
-I was there, for a while.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.052
[in Spanish]
Then I went to Peru.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.095
Aw.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.431
[in Spanish]
Yes, it was great. And...

16:55.431 --> 16:59.644
[in Spanish]
I've been back in L.A. for about

16:55.431 --> 16:59.644
four months, now.

16:59.644 --> 17:00.895
Ah!

17:01.061 --> 17:03.439
[in Spanish]
Right. And you didn't

17:01.061 --> 17:03.439
let anyone know?

17:03.439 --> 17:06.943
[in Spanish]
I didn't... I, um...

17:06.943 --> 17:10.321
[in Spanish]
I didn't.

17:06.943 --> 17:10.321
i didn't know how to...

17:11.071 --> 17:13.783
[in Spanish]
I just don't know. I'm sorry.

17:13.783 --> 17:16.369
[in Spanish]
Why are you apologizing to me?

17:13.783 --> 17:16.369
You don't have to.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.038
[in Spanish]
No. I mean...

17:20.707 --> 17:21.708
[in Spanish]
You know what? Um...

17:21.708 --> 17:23.459
-Hi. Uh, I'm, Asher Grace.
-Oh, God.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.753
-Hi, nice to meet you, Asher.
-How are you?

17:25.753 --> 17:28.088
-Daniel, this is Asher Grace.
-Asher Grace.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.466
You're a long way
from home, aren't you?

17:30.466 --> 17:32.886
-Well, Australia is...
-You're from Australia?

17:32.886 --> 17:35.137
...four, fif--
Seventeen hours away, yeah.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.890
-Oh, wow.
-Well, he does...

17:36.890 --> 17:40.601
He has, um,
a Mexican grandmother

17:36.890 --> 17:40.601
named Jacinta.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.228
Really?
[laughs]

17:42.228 --> 17:43.354
Yeah.

17:43.354 --> 17:44.397
No, he doesn't.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.983
No, he doesn't.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.651
Nice try, though.

17:48.651 --> 17:51.111
Well, he does speak
great Spanish, though.

17:51.111 --> 17:52.572
It's uncanny. Yeah.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.491
[in Spanish]
Nice to meet you, man... truly.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.035
[in Spanish]
My pleasure... truly.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.829
Anyway, we were just gonna,
uh, see what table

17:57.035 --> 17:59.829
we were gonna sit at.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.748
-Um... yeah.
Where are you gonna sit?

17:59.829 --> 18:01.748
-Yeah.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.375
I don't know, but since
I'm crashing the wedding,

18:04.375 --> 18:06.126
probably at your table.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.795
Oh, okay. Yeah.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.088
Maybe I'll take
your seat!

18:09.088 --> 18:10.297
I'm just kidding.

18:10.297 --> 18:13.426
This guy, you know,
he's, like, deformed

18:13.426 --> 18:15.845
because of the accident,
exposed fracture.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.180
Then he looks at me,
looks at the syringe,

18:18.180 --> 18:22.476
and goes, "Mm, you know what,
doc? It's not that serious."

18:22.476 --> 18:23.937
[laughing]
He just walk--

18:23.937 --> 18:26.898
Stands up and storms
out of the clinic!

18:26.898 --> 18:28.274
It was...

So, you're with Doctors
Without Borders?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.152
-Yeah.
-Ah.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.654
And you like it?

18:33.654 --> 18:35.155
Oh, I love it.
Yeah, you know,

18:35.155 --> 18:39.159
I get to meet a lot of people,
see wonderful places.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.202
I like to move around.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.162
Of course you do.

18:42.162 --> 18:45.625
Well, I really believe
that if you stand still

18:42.162 --> 18:45.625
too long,

18:45.625 --> 18:47.334
then your life
starts living you.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.336
It should always be
the other way around.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.171
Wow. Ladies
and gentlemen,

18:57.678 --> 18:58.888
Oh, I know, trust me.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.431
You do not have
to convince any of us

19:00.431 --> 19:02.182
of how hard it is
for you to stay put.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.267
Play nice, Clarita.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.477
What? I'm sorry.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.353
No, I mean, you say
the wrong thing,

for another decade!

19:10.066 --> 19:13.027
No, seriously,
I think it's wonderful,

19:13.027 --> 19:15.195
all the things
you've seen and done.

19:15.195 --> 19:17.531
-Hmm.
-Mom is proud of you.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.992
I'm just...
I don't know.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.745
I'm just very happy
to be here now.

-It'll just be a sec.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

19:58.072 --> 20:01.200
So, being a doctor,
is that pretty fun for you?

20:24.891 --> 20:26.017
[in Spanish]
What?

20:28.186 --> 20:29.812
[in Spanish]
Nothing. I'm just looking at

20:28.186 --> 20:29.812
you. I haven't seen you in a
million years.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.287
-What?

20:47.287 --> 20:51.250
[in Spanish]
No, that's it. You look great,

20:47.287 --> 20:51.250
you always looked great.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.294
[in Spanish]
You too.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.630
[in Spanish]
You look great.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.174
[in Spanish]
Always.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.467
[in Spanish]
Always?

21:01.802 --> 21:03.262
[in Spanish]
Since always.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.642
[in Spanish]
Even in a bridesmaid's dress

21:05.598 --> 21:08.642
my mom picked out?

21:10.477 --> 21:12.312
[in Spanish]
And Abby?

21:13.480 --> 21:16.567
[in Spanish]
You look great even holding

21:13.480 --> 21:16.567
hands with a little Australian.

21:18.069 --> 21:21.321
[both in Spanish]
-Don't start.

21:18.069 --> 21:21.321
-What? It's not easy, really...

21:21.321 --> 21:24.867
[in Spanish]
Not all beauty would hold up

21:21.321 --> 21:24.867
to a challenge like that.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.286
[in Spanish]
Only yours. You're tremendous!

21:28.788 --> 21:29.622
[in Spanish]
Oh, Daniel.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.341
[in Spanish]
You look just the same.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.136
[in Spanish]
Yeah?

21:43.136 --> 21:46.346
[in Spanish]
Where it counts

21:43.136 --> 21:46.346
you look exactly the same.

21:46.346 --> 21:47.306
[in Spanish]
My butt?

21:51.185 --> 21:52.311
[in Spanish]
Right here.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.192
[in Spanish]
It's one of my favorite places

21:55.397 --> 21:58.192
in the world, you know?

21:58.943 --> 22:00.987
[in Spanish]
And yet you haven't visited

21:58.943 --> 22:00.987
in a long time.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.492
[in Spanish]
I've done nothing but miss it.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.578
[in Spanish]
Liar.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.968
[song ends]

22:30.390 --> 22:33.144
[sobbing]

22:56.334 --> 22:58.127
Oh, God.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.049
Pay no attention
to this.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.425
It has nothing to do
with reality.

23:05.425 --> 23:07.261
[quavering sigh]

23:09.429 --> 23:10.639
Come on.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.024
I'm so sorry
about all of this.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.068
Don't-- Do not--
Don't be silly.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.402
We all have
one of those. Come on.

23:25.445 --> 23:26.446
Yeah?

23:26.446 --> 23:27.614
Yeah.

23:28.866 --> 23:31.493
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.412
[up-tempo Latin music]

23:43.297 --> 23:44.298
Hey!

23:44.298 --> 23:46.342
Clara's probably
up at the house.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.469
Oh, no, I was
looking for you guys.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.180
Why is he back,
you know?

23:51.180 --> 23:53.766
All smiles!
Hugging people!

23:53.766 --> 23:56.185
I mean, we haven't
even seen him in years.

23:56.185 --> 23:59.437
Decades, almost,
and suddenly he's

23:56.185 --> 23:59.437
still family?

23:59.437 --> 24:00.898
It's just wrong.

24:00.898 --> 24:04.110
But he's not...
family, is he?

24:06.528 --> 24:07.863
What?

24:07.863 --> 24:10.490
He's not actually family,
though, is he?

24:10.490 --> 24:12.659
-You're disgusting. No!
-Well, I'm not.

24:12.659 --> 24:15.871
Ah, good. No, I'm making sure
you're not disgusting.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.539
If you-- Because...

24:17.539 --> 24:20.376
No, truly, I was...

24:20.376 --> 24:23.337
Yeah, you know...

24:29.635 --> 24:33.097
Do you want to...
tell me about it?

24:38.144 --> 24:39.145
Well...

24:40.520 --> 24:43.190
Ahem. Hmm.

24:44.524 --> 24:47.320
For a split second, he...

24:47.320 --> 24:52.283
could've been
my husband, and...

24:53.575 --> 24:57.413
then he just wasn't.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.081
Got it.

25:00.291 --> 25:01.792
[man]<i> Arriba!</i>

25:05.838 --> 25:07.589
We should go.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.426
-Blushing bride awaits.
-Yeah.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.765
[chuckles]

25:17.057 --> 25:18.558
[in Spanish]
Clara, where were you?

25:18.558 --> 25:20.936
[both in Spanish]
-We were chatting.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.936
-But where?

25:20.936 --> 25:22.562
You warming up
for the dance-off?

25:22.562 --> 25:25.316
Don't practice too--
I want to see some

25:22.562 --> 25:25.316
of these practice--

25:25.316 --> 25:27.567
-He's been stretching. Yeah.
-Thank you very much.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.569
-I have indeed.
-You just wait and see.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.529
[speaking Spanish]

26:03.937 --> 26:05.689
-Hi.
-Hello.

26:05.689 --> 26:08.108
Is, uh, Dr. Barron in yet?

26:08.108 --> 26:10.861
Does she know
what this is regarding?

26:10.861 --> 26:13.613
Yeah. Yeah, it's, um...
We work togeth--

26:13.613 --> 26:15.699
Uh, occasionally
we'll work together.

26:15.699 --> 26:17.826
Um, and she wanted
to talk, uh, strategy.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.578
You know what?
Just go in.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.373
Thank you.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.625
[knocks]

26:25.625 --> 26:26.877
Morning.

26:26.877 --> 26:29.629
Hi.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.340
Okay.

26:32.716 --> 26:33.967
Hi.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.470
Hi.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.264
Hey, so I was, uh...

26:38.264 --> 26:40.015
I was thinking
that maybe tonight,

26:40.015 --> 26:42.976
you and I could go
on a proper date,

26:42.976 --> 26:45.771
you know, with dinner
and tablecloths and such.

26:45.771 --> 26:49.691
Asher, you're really sweet,
seriously, thank you so much

26:49.691 --> 26:53.653
for coming to the wedding
and putting up with all the...

26:53.653 --> 26:55.655
"Aah!" but, uh, yeah.

26:55.655 --> 26:57.866
No, this is--
It's not happening.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.659
Why not?

26:59.659 --> 27:02.496
Uh, well, you work for me.

27:02.496 --> 27:05.374
Yeah, well, I don't
at all, actually,

27:02.496 --> 27:05.374
so that's...

27:05.374 --> 27:07.667
Still, I don't date
anyone in the hospital.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.336
But we already dated.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.671
-Am I wrong?
-No, that was just sort of

27:11.671 --> 27:13.048
like a... [squees]

27:13.048 --> 27:15.675
emergency, you know,
not a date.

27:15.675 --> 27:16.760
Clara.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.679
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I really wish I liked you.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.681
I really do, but...

27:21.681 --> 27:23.434
I don't.

27:23.434 --> 27:24.810
Why not?

27:24.810 --> 27:26.728
Why not? Come on,
let me know.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.606
This is--
No, screw the date.

27:28.606 --> 27:29.731
I'm interested now.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.609
-Okay, um...
-What's wrong with me?

27:31.609 --> 27:33.527
Well, you're just--
You're not my type.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.362
Ah, because I'm
too attractive?

27:35.362 --> 27:37.072
[laughs]
Gotta get this sorted.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.699
You're not the first to say--
No, no, seriously, look at me.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.161
-You're not the first person
to say this to me.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.161
-Okay, fine.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.580
-Many, many women.
-Okay, fine, it's the... Crocs.

27:44.580 --> 27:47.040
You wear Crocs
with cartoon pins in them.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.875
I'm in Peds.
The kids like them.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.919
Kids also like to eat
their own bodily fluids.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.171
Okay, yeah, no,
you're right.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.713
The Crocs are gone.
Is that it? Done.

27:53.713 --> 27:55.715
-Oh, they're gone? That's it?
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.510
No, now there's the fact
that you're willing

27:57.510 --> 28:00.012
to change your personality
to get a girl to like you.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.056
Wow. that was easy. Um...

28:03.056 --> 28:05.392
All right, yeah, no,
I, uh... I get it.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.186
-Yeah, I'm sorry.
-It's about, um...

28:07.186 --> 28:09.647
It's about
that guy, right?

28:09.647 --> 28:11.731
You wish
you liked me,

28:11.731 --> 28:14.568
but I'm not him,
so therefore you can't.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.570
Hey, why aren't
you with him, hmm?

28:16.570 --> 28:20.533
You know, apart
from the fact that he's

28:16.570 --> 28:20.533
a self-important arsehole,

28:20.533 --> 28:22.951
which, I assume, only makes
him more attractive.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.662
He's bad for me.

28:24.662 --> 28:26.330
How so?

28:26.330 --> 28:28.290
He leaves.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.708
I thought you'd like that.
Saves you the trouble.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.672
You don't know me.

28:34.672 --> 28:37.633
I'm-- I'm-- Hey. I'm trying
to change that, Clara.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.928
Let me.

28:46.433 --> 28:49.645
Um, I have a patient.
I'm sorry.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.278
[door closing]
[heartbeat thumping]

28:58.278 --> 28:59.321
[in Spanish]
There he is.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.782
[in Spanish]
Everything looks good.

29:02.782 --> 29:05.035
[in Spanish]
God, he's so handsome.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.786
[in Spanish]
Isn't he?

29:06.786 --> 29:08.788
[in Spanish]
Look. Beto...

29:08.788 --> 29:10.457
[in Spanish]
Beto, look at him.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.501
[in Spanish]
He's our little Clark.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.921
[in Spanish]
Clark?

29:15.921 --> 29:17.756
[in Spanish]
Like Superman.

29:19.049 --> 29:21.677
[in Spanish]
He looks happy, doesn't he?

29:21.677 --> 29:22.928
[in Spanish]
Doesn't he?

29:22.928 --> 29:25.305
[in Spanish]
Beto...

29:22.928 --> 29:25.305
Doesn't he look happy?

29:25.305 --> 29:26.515
[in Spanish]
He doesn't look anything.

29:28.225 --> 29:29.602
[in Spanish]
He looks happy.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.397
[in Spanish]
Okay, he looks happy.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.817
[in Spanish]
I talk with him a lot, Doctor.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.819
[in Spanish]
Whenever I'm frustrated,

29:39.819 --> 29:40.820
[in Spanish]
or angry, or I just wanna...

29:39.819 --> 29:40.820
just...

29:40.820 --> 29:43.282
[growls]

29:44.116 --> 29:50.080
[in Spanish]
I talk to Clark and I just open

29:44.116 --> 29:50.080
my heart to him.

29:50.080 --> 29:54.585
[in Spanish]
Good thing he can't hear, right?

29:50.080 --> 29:54.585
So it's less inappropriate.

29:54.585 --> 29:57.630
[in Spanish]
He hears me,

29:54.585 --> 29:57.630
he's not like his dad that way.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.006
[sighs]

30:00.006 --> 30:02.760
[music playing]

30:02.760 --> 30:05.804
[buzzing]

30:09.891 --> 30:12.352
[both in Spanish]
-Hi, sis.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.352
-Hey, are you at your bar?

30:12.352 --> 30:13.979
[both in Spanish]
-<i> Yeah.</i>

30:12.352 --> 30:13.979
-Good.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.189
[in Spanish]
What do you mean, good?

30:13.979 --> 30:16.189
I have a bar.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.650
[in Spanish]
I'm so going to hell.

30:17.650 --> 30:19.859
[in Spanish]
-Stay there for a bit, okay?

30:17.650 --> 30:19.859
-<i> Why?</i>

30:19.859 --> 30:25.115
[in Spanish]
<i>Because... I'm your sister</i>

30:19.859 --> 30:25.115
<i>and I command you.</i>

30:25.115 --> 30:27.159
[in Spanish]
<i>What?</i>

30:25.115 --> 30:27.159
<i>What is it?</i>

30:27.159 --> 30:28.076
[in Spanish]
<i>Are you crying?</i>

30:28.076 --> 30:29.869
[in Spanish]
<i>Why is he back?</i>

30:29.869 --> 30:32.872
[in Spanish]
Hang in there, alright?

30:29.869 --> 30:32.872
He wont stay.

30:32.872 --> 30:34.333
[in Spanish]
I'm going home, bye.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.669
[in Spanish]
<i>No, no... wait just five</i>

30:34.333 --> 30:36.669
<i>minutes!</i>

30:47.429 --> 30:49.473
You leaving
so early?

30:59.941 --> 31:02.444
Hi!

31:02.444 --> 31:04.904
Hey!

31:04.904 --> 31:05.905
Hi.

31:05.905 --> 31:06.948
[laughs] Hi!

31:06.948 --> 31:08.116
How are you?

31:08.116 --> 31:09.909
I'm good!

31:09.909 --> 31:11.870
Okay. Okay.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.622
My sister is the best.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.457
It's good
to see you, too.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.417
You really are
pretty, aren't you?

31:17.417 --> 31:20.462
Ohh... you're drunk.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.715
No.

31:22.715 --> 31:25.925
Yeah. Here.

31:25.925 --> 31:27.803
There we go.

31:27.803 --> 31:29.555
This is amazing!

31:29.555 --> 31:33.058
Yeah. Oh, yeah, well, I...
I didn't do it, so...

31:33.058 --> 31:37.062
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say,
it screams designer

31:33.058 --> 31:37.062
ex-girlfriend at me.

31:37.062 --> 31:40.106
Mm. Your bedroom's weird.

31:40.106 --> 31:43.485
It's like Martha Stewart
got tired when she got

31:40.106 --> 31:43.485
to the door.

31:43.485 --> 31:46.154
Oh, you're one of those
really funny drunks.

31:46.154 --> 31:49.949
Mm! Ho ho!
I'm sorry.

31:49.949 --> 31:52.285
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

31:49.949 --> 31:52.285
I'm sorry.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.662
Here, come.

31:53.662 --> 31:54.913
All right. Okay.

31:54.913 --> 31:59.418
Mm. Just sleep.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.170
Mm.

32:05.965 --> 32:07.133
What?

32:07.133 --> 32:09.261
I'm taking the couch.

32:11.221 --> 32:12.806
You're blue-balling me?

32:12.806 --> 32:13.973
Good night.

44:51.648 --> 44:53.774

Don't tell me you regret it

44:51.648 --> 44:53.774

No, no, I don't regret it.

44:59.947 --> 45:02.741

you to come with me.

45:02.741 --> 45:05.370
[in Spanish]
Force me?

45:02.741 --> 45:05.370
You didn't even invite me.

45:05.370 --> 45:07.413
[in Spanish]
You wouldn't have come.

45:07.746 --> 45:09.582
[in Spanish]
Would you... have come?

45:11.167 --> 45:12.751

-What's the name of the boy

45:20.759 --> 45:23.762

45:31.604 --> 45:32.897

he's not your type.

45:34.524 --> 45:35.900

45:35.900 --> 45:40.154
[in Spanish]
I know you, people don't change.

45:35.900 --> 45:40.154
He's not your type.

45:40.154 --> 45:44.409
[both in Spanish]
-I'm trying him on for size.

45:40.154 --> 45:44.409
-There...
he's too small for you.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.662
[both in Spanish]
-He's good. He's sweet and good.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.662
-He's a Koala!

45:47.828 --> 45:49.872

You're dating a Koala.

45:51.790 --> 45:52.791

Shut up.

45:52.791 --> 45:55.336

He's just easy...

45:55.336 --> 45:58.130

45:58.130 --> 46:00.925
-A lot.

46:00.925 --> 46:02.759
[in Spanish]
So, so...

46:02.759 --> 46:05.597
[both in Spanish]
-I don't wanna talk

46:02.759 --> 46:05.597
about this anymore.
-Why not?

46:06.556 --> 46:09.392
[in Spanish]
With you, I don't wanna talk

46:06.556 --> 46:09.392
about this with you.

46:11.603 --> 46:12.604
[in Spanish]
Okay.

46:15.523 --> 46:18.192
[both in Spanish]
-So what about you?

46:15.523 --> 46:18.192

46:21.820 --> 46:23.864
-That's for sure.

46:25.782 --> 46:30.455
[in Spanish]
You haven't found anyone who

46:25.782 --> 46:30.455
seemed good enough for a first
wife yet?

46:30.455 --> 46:31.830
[in Spanish]
No.

46:31.830 --> 46:34.166
[both in Spanish]
-Really? No one?

46:31.830 --> 46:34.166

46:34.166 --> 46:36.669
[in Spanish]
Only you, but you're with koala.

46:39.004 --> 46:42.007

Besides, you already were

46:39.004 --> 46:42.007
my first wife.

46:43.426 --> 46:47.722
[in Spanish]
I don't remember you

46:43.426 --> 46:47.722
as my lawfully wedded anything.

46:47.722 --> 46:49.724
[in Spanish]
What's a wife?

46:47.722 --> 46:49.724
Family, home...

46:54.395 --> 46:56.855
[both in Spanish]
-You're my first home.

46:56.855 --> 46:58.691

-Exactly.

46:56.855 --> 46:58.691

46:58.691 --> 47:00.985

First homes are

46:58.691 --> 47:00.985

47:05.948 --> 47:08.534
[in Spanish]
Come on, smooth guy.

47:05.948 --> 47:08.534
Time to go.

47:09.868 --> 47:11.579

Hey!

47:11.579 --> 47:12.580
[in Spanish]
About time!

47:13.956 --> 47:15.832

How was your morning?

47:18.210 --> 47:19.836
[in Spanish]
It was fine.

47:19.836 --> 47:21.046
[in Spanish]
Fine, fine?

47:21.046 --> 47:23.840
[in Spanish]
You and Daniel talked?

47:23.840 --> 47:25.884
[in Spanish]
Why is he here, mom?

47:25.884 --> 47:27.679
[in Spanish]
He came back.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.514
[in Spanish]
He came back to Los Angeles,

47:27.679 --> 47:29.514
why is he<i> here</i> ?

47:29.514 --> 47:32.224
[in Spanish]
He invited himself.

47:29.514 --> 47:32.224
I wonder why.

47:32.224 --> 47:33.267
[in Spanish]
Mother...

47:33.267 --> 47:34.893
[in Spanish]
Stop encouraging her.

47:34.893 --> 47:38.897
[in Spanish]
But why? I can't help it

47:34.893 --> 47:38.897
if I'm happy to see him.

47:38.897 --> 47:43.152
[in Spanish]
When I hug him it's like

47:38.897 --> 47:43.152
I'm hugging Clara ten years ago.

47:43.152 --> 47:46.030
[in Spanish]
He's a time in her life.

47:46.030 --> 47:49.283
[in Spanish]
Which time?

47:46.030 --> 47:49.283
The happy-in-love time or...

47:49.283 --> 47:53.329
[in Spanish]
the crying-herself-to-sleep-

47:49.283 --> 47:53.329

The way Daniel made you laugh...

47:58.584 --> 48:01.462
[in Spanish]
just can't forget it.

48:01.462 --> 48:04.632
[in Spanish]
It made the entire house shake.

48:04.632 --> 48:07.051

Laughter that could

48:04.632 --> 48:07.051
make you fly.

48:07.051 --> 48:08.260

Oh yeah,

Could you please call Lilly

55:59.190 --> 56:02.318

56:05.946 --> 56:06.989

What are you wearing?

56:15.122 --> 56:17.415

56:23.463 --> 56:25.174

And also, I called Asher and

56:31.222 --> 56:33.431
I asked him to come.

56:33.431 --> 56:35.433
[in Spanish]
Now he's not answering

56:33.431 --> 56:35.433
and I need to go stop him.

56:35.433 --> 56:38.229

I'm looking for Dr. Grace.

57:32.824 --> 57:34.910
He's a resident
down here.

57:34.910 --> 57:37.121
I know who he is.
He's not here.

57:37.121 --> 57:39.581
Um, are you sure?
'Cause he said he would be...

57:39.581 --> 57:41.499
I'm sure. He asked
for the shift off.

57:41.499 --> 57:44.044
Annoyed the crap
out of me.

57:44.044 --> 57:46.504
Okay.

57:46.504 --> 57:49.383
[ringing]

57:50.508 --> 57:53.137
<i>This is Asher Grace.</i>
<i>Message, please.</i>

57:54.554 --> 57:55.973
Mm...

57:57.308 --> 57:58.850
[in Spanish]
Well...

57:58.850 --> 58:00.602
[in Spanish]
So far so good.

58:00.602 --> 58:03.521
[in Spanish]
Looks like Clark's been having

58:00.602 --> 58:03.521
nothing but good times.

58:03.521 --> 58:06.066
[in Spanish]
We've been working out together.

58:06.066 --> 58:07.818
[in Spanish]
Together you and Beto?

58:07.818 --> 58:11.363
[in Spanish]
No, me and Clark.

58:11.363 --> 58:13.031
[in Spanish]
That's safe, right? Exercise?

58:13.031 --> 58:15.159
[in Spanish]
Of course. As long as

58:15.159 --> 58:20.122
[in Spanish]
it's not high impact and

58:15.159 --> 58:20.122
you feel good after. Keep it up.

58:20.122 --> 58:21.498
[both in Spanish]
Cool, cool.

58:23.750 --> 58:26.503
[in Spanish]
Beto's never been one for

58:23.750 --> 58:26.503
exercising. You wouldn't know to
look at him but...

58:26.503 --> 58:29.423
[in Spanish]
his belly is as big as mine,

58:26.503 --> 58:29.423
but for no reason.

58:29.423 --> 58:31.467
[in Spanish]
Between that and the hair,

58:29.423 --> 58:31.467
well...

58:33.551 --> 58:37.097
[in Spanish]
You know what, Lilly? This is

58:33.551 --> 58:37.097
none of my business, but...

58:37.097 --> 58:39.975
[in Spanish]
you're having a kid with the

58:37.097 --> 58:39.975
man, you shouldn't talk to him
that way.

58:39.975 --> 58:41.810
[in Spanish]
And Beto, stop rubbing

58:39.975 --> 58:41.810
that shirt!

58:42.811 --> 58:47.358
[in Spanish]
Whatever's on it is not coming

58:42.811 --> 58:47.358
out right now so maybe, just...

58:47.358 --> 58:50.568
[in Spanish]
I've known you for a long time.

58:47.358 --> 58:50.568
You have good hearts,

58:50.568 --> 58:51.736
[in Spanish]
you used to be in love and

58:50.568 --> 58:51.736
you had the potential to make

58:51.736 --> 58:53.864
[in Spanish]
remarkably decent parents.

58:53.864 --> 58:56.283
[in Spanish]
But if you keep this crap

58:53.864 --> 58:56.283
up, which you're great at
by the way...

58:56.283 --> 58:58.952
[in Spanish]
the only thing you'll have

58:56.283 --> 58:58.952
potential for is scarring

58:58.952 --> 59:00.912
[in Spanish]
a brand new human being

58:58.952 --> 59:00.912
for life,

59:00.912 --> 59:03.581
[in Spanish]
it's not his fault his parents

59:00.912 --> 59:03.581
can't stand each other.

59:03.581 --> 59:07.002
[in Spanish]
So sort yourselves out together

59:03.581 --> 59:07.002
or stay the hell apart.

59:07.627 --> 59:10.588
[in Spanish]
'Cause bringing a child into

59:07.627 --> 59:10.588
this thing you have now...

59:10.588 --> 59:11.589
Mm-mm.

59:11.589 --> 59:13.175
[in Spanish]
is not great. Okay?

59:13.717 --> 59:15.427
Okay?

59:17.595 --> 59:19.306
Okay, okay.

59:20.432 --> 59:21.475
[in Spanish]
Yes.

59:23.977 --> 59:27.856
[in Spanish]
Wonderfull.

59:27.856 --> 59:31.276
[in Spanish]
Your visit's on me today.

59:31.276 --> 59:32.569
[in Spanish]
Why not?

59:34.488 --> 59:36.114
Watch it, idiot!

59:36.114 --> 59:37.615
-Sorry!
-Asher!

59:37.615 --> 59:39.576
Clara. What are you
doing here?

59:39.576 --> 59:41.828
I'm literally on my way
to your parents' house.

59:41.828 --> 59:44.664
I, uh, had a patient,
and I was looking for you.

59:44.664 --> 59:46.500
But you're not answering
your phone,

59:46.500 --> 59:48.460
and you're not at work
when you say you

59:46.500 --> 59:48.460
will be, so...

59:48.460 --> 59:49.586
Clara, I can explain.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.338
Uh, don't.

59:51.338 --> 59:53.965
Uh, I gotta go.
I have to go

59:51.338 --> 59:53.965
to my parents' for dinner.

59:53.965 --> 59:57.302
-Yeah, well, let's go.
-Uh, no. No.

59:57.302 --> 59:59.763
Are you uninviting me
to the family weekend?

59:59.763 --> 1:00:01.390
Yes.

1:00:01.390 --> 1:00:02.349
Uh-uh.

1:00:02.349 --> 1:00:03.975
You don't want to come,
trust me.

1:00:03.975 --> 1:00:05.352
I do. I do.

1:00:05.352 --> 1:00:06.478
Asher.

1:00:06.478 --> 1:00:07.812
Clara.

1:00:07.812 --> 1:00:11.233
I do.

1:00:11.233 --> 1:00:12.192
Pfft.

1:00:12.192 --> 1:00:14.611
Whatever it is,
I'm up for it.

1:00:17.822 --> 1:00:20.992
[gentle music plays]

1:00:23.661 --> 1:00:24.662
[turns off music]

1:00:24.662 --> 1:00:26.248
Hey, I, uh...

1:00:26.248 --> 1:00:28.417
I want to explain
where I've been

1:00:28.417 --> 1:00:30.085
the past couple
of days, and why

1:00:30.085 --> 1:00:32.003
I wasn't answering
my phone.

1:00:32.003 --> 1:00:34.256
-No, that's okay.
-No, no, no, I want to.

1:00:34.256 --> 1:00:35.673
Um...

1:00:35.673 --> 1:00:38.718
So, my wife, Liz, she...

1:00:38.718 --> 1:00:39.886
Your wife?

1:00:39.886 --> 1:00:41.221
Well, see...

1:00:41.221 --> 1:00:42.722
Your wife?
Oh, my God.

1:00:42.722 --> 1:00:44.682
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not like that.

1:00:44.682 --> 1:00:47.727
-No, she's not around
or anything.

1:00:44.682 --> 1:00:47.727
-Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot.

1:00:47.727 --> 1:00:51.648
-What do you mean,
she's not around?

1:00:47.727 --> 1:00:51.648
-She's dead, Clara.

1:00:51.648 --> 1:00:53.233
She died.

1:00:59.072 --> 1:01:00.782
My God, Asher,
I'm so sorry.

1:01:00.782 --> 1:01:04.119
It's-- you...

1:01:04.119 --> 1:01:07.164
It was, uh,
two years ago yesterday.

1:01:10.792 --> 1:01:12.669
And I forgot.

1:01:14.921 --> 1:01:16.590
You forgot?

1:01:16.590 --> 1:01:18.509
The, uh, the date.

1:01:20.177 --> 1:01:22.720
Caught me by surprise.
I just-- I've been...

1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:24.806
Look, I wanted
to apologize

1:01:24.806 --> 1:01:27.017
because I was supposed
to be at work,

1:01:27.017 --> 1:01:29.144
and I know I wasn't,
and I'm sorry.

1:01:29.144 --> 1:01:32.939
Yeah, damn, yeah, yeah.
No. Okay.

1:01:38.028 --> 1:01:41.365
You're a 28-year-old widower?

1:01:41.365 --> 1:01:42.533
Yeah.

1:01:42.533 --> 1:01:46.703
Yeah, I was, uh, 19
when we got married.

1:01:48.622 --> 1:01:50.040
Why?

1:01:50.832 --> 1:01:53.710
I was in love.

1:01:55.920 --> 1:01:58.298
Yeah, well...

1:01:58.298 --> 1:02:01.718
I was in love when I was 19,
and I didn't get married.

1:02:03.053 --> 1:02:05.597
Well, I did.

1:02:10.977 --> 1:02:13.647
Oh, my God, I'm such
a horrible person.

1:02:13.647 --> 1:02:16.774
What? Why?

1:02:21.029 --> 1:02:23.615
Daniel is
at my parents' house right now.

1:02:23.615 --> 1:02:24.741
Yeah, of course he is.

1:02:29.037 --> 1:02:31.789
[chuckling]

1:02:31.789 --> 1:02:33.584
What do you mean,
"Of course he is"?

1:02:33.584 --> 1:02:36.753
Well, you obviously needed
some form of extreme backup

1:02:36.753 --> 1:02:39.797
when you changed your mind
about inviting me.

1:02:39.797 --> 1:02:40.924
Come on!

1:02:40.924 --> 1:02:43.093
[laughing]

1:02:44.469 --> 1:02:47.013
Are we both
completely screwed up, Ash?

1:02:47.013 --> 1:02:48.306
Both of--?
No, you are.

1:02:48.306 --> 1:02:49.807
That's for certain.

1:02:49.807 --> 1:02:52.519
Me, I'm
a respectable widower,

1:02:49.807 --> 1:02:52.519
thank you very much.

1:02:52.519 --> 1:02:54.646
Right, you do have that
going for you.

1:02:54.646 --> 1:02:55.647
Yeah.

1:03:06.157 --> 1:03:07.825
Bring on the ex, hmm?

1:03:07.825 --> 1:03:09.620
[chuckles]

1:03:11.496 --> 1:03:16.000
[in Spanish]
Are you allowed to scold your

1:03:11.496 --> 1:03:16.000
patients as if they were your
third grade class?

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:17.586
[in Spanish]
No.

1:03:17.586 --> 1:03:19.796
[in Spanish]
But they pushed me

1:03:17.586 --> 1:03:19.796
over the edge.

1:03:19.796 --> 1:03:21.798
[in Spanish]
Whatever, you're their doctor.

1:03:21.798 --> 1:03:23.717
[in Spanish]
They have to trust you.

1:03:23.717 --> 1:03:25.719
[in Spanish]
Asher agrees with me.

1:03:25.885 --> 1:03:27.804
I know, I do.

1:03:28.305 --> 1:03:30.848
[in Spanish]
Okay, but they do trust her!

1:03:30.848 --> 1:03:34.894
[in Spanish]
That's why it's great that you

1:03:30.848 --> 1:03:34.894
said it. Im sorry, but yeah...

1:03:34.894 --> 1:03:38.315
[in Spanish]
People don't know what they

1:03:34.894 --> 1:03:38.315
want, so they just walk around

1:03:38.315 --> 1:03:41.151
[in Spanish]
coupling up like

1:03:38.315 --> 1:03:41.151
it'll save them.

1:03:41.151 --> 1:03:43.194
[in Spanish]
And, I'm sorry, but it won't.

1:03:43.194 --> 1:03:46.990
[in Spanish]
So it's great that someone they

1:03:43.194 --> 1:03:46.990
trust can tell them how it is.

1:03:47.949 --> 1:03:50.535
[in Spanish]
I may have gone too far,

1:03:47.949 --> 1:03:50.535
but they deserve it!

1:03:50.619 --> 1:03:52.788
You guys should see them.
They hate each other.

1:03:52.788 --> 1:03:55.123
And I've known them
for a while and they

1:03:52.788 --> 1:03:55.123
used to be happy.

1:03:55.123 --> 1:03:58.752
Then they chose the moment
when their marriage went

1:03:55.123 --> 1:03:58.752
to shit to have a baby.

1:03:58.752 --> 1:04:01.004
It's just...

1:04:01.004 --> 1:04:02.380
It's mean.

1:04:02.380 --> 1:04:03.840
[in Spanish]
Exactly!

1:04:04.633 --> 1:04:07.511
[Asher] It's mean to have a go
at someone you don't know

1:04:07.511 --> 1:04:09.887
about things
you don't understand.

1:04:09.887 --> 1:04:11.264
Well, yeah,
but no.

1:04:11.264 --> 1:04:14.726
Ahem. I mean, it takes
two seconds to see

1:04:14.726 --> 1:04:17.437
if a couple is happy, you know,
if they belong together,

1:04:17.437 --> 1:04:19.063
or if they
just settled, right?

1:04:19.063 --> 1:04:20.524
Right, Clara?

1:04:20.524 --> 1:04:23.067
I mean, look
in this room.

1:04:23.067 --> 1:04:24.944
No? Look at Francisco
and Eva.

1:04:24.944 --> 1:04:27.405
It's obvious
they belong together.

1:04:27.405 --> 1:04:30.659
Obvious who's happy
and who's not.

1:04:31.868 --> 1:04:33.495
Here you go.

1:04:40.418 --> 1:04:44.422
Yeah, the mole's, um,
it's great. Ahem.

1:04:44.422 --> 1:04:47.592
Where did you, uh...
How'd you learn how to make it?

1:04:47.592 --> 1:04:49.927
Oh, this old lady
in Oaxaca taught me.

1:04:49.927 --> 1:04:53.973
We were setting up
sort of like a pirate

1:04:49.927 --> 1:04:53.973
health station.

1:04:53.973 --> 1:04:55.809
Thanks.

1:05:00.397 --> 1:05:03.400
[in Spanish]
He's not neutralizing him,

1:05:00.397 --> 1:05:03.400
is he?

1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:04.693
[in Spanish]
Maybe you can have

1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:04.693
a threesome later.

1:05:04.693 --> 1:05:06.944
The trick is just to let
the last chili float.

1:05:06.944 --> 1:05:08.572
It will be great
with the chocolate,

1:05:08.572 --> 1:05:11.032
so then you get
the hotness

1:05:08.572 --> 1:05:11.032
without the acidity.

1:05:11.032 --> 1:05:12.283
You get the punch.

1:05:12.283 --> 1:05:14.494
Actually, if you
grind it all up before,

1:05:14.494 --> 1:05:17.455
and then let it meld together,
it makes it smoother.

1:05:17.455 --> 1:05:19.957
But it's probably a bit
too late for that now, I guess.

1:05:19.957 --> 1:05:21.501
Oh, is that right?

1:05:21.501 --> 1:05:24.921
Oh, sorry, one of my patients
is the son of a Mexican chef.

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:27.215
Oh, 'cause I thought
your Mexican grandmother

1:05:27.215 --> 1:05:28.966
Jacinta taught you
how to make mole.

1:05:28.966 --> 1:05:30.968
She's not real, Daniel.
Clara made her up.

1:05:30.968 --> 1:05:33.930
We can't all be
as authentically Mexican

1:05:30.968 --> 1:05:33.930
as you, champ.

1:05:33.930 --> 1:05:37.308
Or as randomly bicultural
as you, right, champ?

1:05:37.601 --> 1:05:40.604
[in Spanish]
Okay. Enough, please!

1:05:37.601 --> 1:05:40.604
That's enough!

1:05:41.855 --> 1:05:43.981
[in Spanish]
Thanks for dinner, Daniel.

1:05:43.981 --> 1:05:46.526
[in Spanish]
It's too late for<i> mole</i> .

1:05:46.526 --> 1:05:48.945
[in Spanish]
Let's go to bed, please.

1:05:50.447 --> 1:05:51.948
[in Spanish]
Clara...

1:05:53.241 --> 1:05:54.451
[in Spanish]
Good night.

1:05:54.701 --> 1:05:56.035
[in Spanish]
Good night.

1:05:56.578 --> 1:05:57.746
[in Spanish]
Good night.

1:06:02.709 --> 1:06:04.711
I'm sorry
he's being a dick.

1:06:04.711 --> 1:06:07.004
Don't. Don't, please.

1:06:07.004 --> 1:06:09.633
What, I'm sorry.

1:06:09.633 --> 1:06:11.843
Uh, I gotta say, Clara...

1:06:11.843 --> 1:06:15.179
It's starting to feel like
he has a valid reason for it.

1:06:15.179 --> 1:06:16.890
Ash, I--

1:06:16.890 --> 1:06:19.183
Don't-- I'm not asking
for details.

1:06:19.183 --> 1:06:20.644
I just, um...

1:06:22.437 --> 1:06:24.856
I've gotta say it.

1:06:44.417 --> 1:06:46.043
[Eva]
Good morning, Asher.

1:06:46.043 --> 1:06:47.170
Morning.

1:06:47.170 --> 1:06:49.213
Do you want to play?

1:06:49.213 --> 1:06:51.925
Uh, sure. Yeah.

1:06:57.722 --> 1:06:59.933
[both in Spanish]
-Deal him in, Francisco.

1:06:57.722 --> 1:06:59.933
-Thanks.

1:06:59.933 --> 1:07:03.060
Hey, listen, bro,
I'm really sorry

1:06:59.933 --> 1:07:03.060
about last night.

1:07:03.060 --> 1:07:06.815
It got kind
of weird. I'm sorry.

1:07:06.815 --> 1:07:09.693
It's fine.

1:07:13.070 --> 1:07:15.031
[in Spanish]
What's going on?

1:07:15.281 --> 1:07:17.868
[in Spanish]
You're in time to get in.

1:07:15.281 --> 1:07:17.868
Come on.

1:07:25.834 --> 1:07:29.838
[in Spanish]
This family finds that

1:07:25.834 --> 1:07:29.838
most fights can be fixed
with a game of poker.

1:07:29.838 --> 1:07:33.884
I should probably
let you all know

1:07:29.838 --> 1:07:33.884
I'm not very good.

1:07:33.884 --> 1:07:35.426
Join the club.
[chuckles]

1:07:35.426 --> 1:07:37.428
It's people lying.

1:07:37.428 --> 1:07:39.723
You know, that's what
poker's all about.

1:07:39.723 --> 1:07:41.391
So that's why some
of the members

1:07:41.391 --> 1:07:43.100
of this family
excel at it, hmm?

1:07:43.100 --> 1:07:45.729
Are you good at telling
when someone's lying

1:07:45.729 --> 1:07:49.106
to you, Ash, keeping
stuff from you?

1:07:49.106 --> 1:07:52.485
Good enough to know
you're not talking

1:07:49.106 --> 1:07:52.485
about poker anymore, sure.

1:07:52.485 --> 1:07:54.821
Eh, smart man.

1:07:54.821 --> 1:07:57.281
You still know how
to pick 'em, Clara.

1:07:58.992 --> 1:08:02.119
[in Spanish]
Daniel, will you come with me

1:07:58.992 --> 1:08:02.119
for a second, please?

1:08:02.119 --> 1:08:05.040
[in Spanish]
I'll go anywhere you ask

1:08:02.119 --> 1:08:05.040
for as long as you ask.

1:08:08.125 --> 1:08:11.421
[door opens, slams]

1:08:13.673 --> 1:08:15.091
[in Spanish]
Okay, I'll take two.

1:08:16.133 --> 1:08:17.510
[in Spanish]
Are you having fun?

1:08:17.510 --> 1:08:19.136
[both in Spanish]
-You?

1:08:17.510 --> 1:08:19.136
-Are you enjoying yourself?

1:08:19.136 --> 1:08:21.264
[in Spanish]
You? Did you enjoy

1:08:19.136 --> 1:08:21.264
yourself last night?

1:08:21.264 --> 1:08:22.766
[scoffs]

1:08:22.891 --> 1:08:24.726
[in Spanish]
How old are you?

1:08:25.142 --> 1:08:25.852
[in Spanish]
You're behaving like a child!

1:08:25.852 --> 1:08:27.062
Asher?

1:08:28.271 --> 1:08:29.272
[in Spanish]
Stop it!

1:08:29.272 --> 1:08:32.650
[arguing continues]

1:08:40.617 --> 1:08:42.243
We're doing this?
We're gonna do this?

1:08:42.243 --> 1:08:43.661
We're doing this.
Here we go.

1:08:45.663 --> 1:08:46.998
[in Spanish]
I don't wanna wake up

1:08:45.663 --> 1:08:46.998
alone feeling like a
jackass ever again.

1:08:46.998 --> 1:08:49.417
[in Spanish]
You can't even stay

1:08:46.998 --> 1:08:49.417
and sleep next to me.

1:08:49.417 --> 1:08:53.088
[in Spanish]
All you've ever done is leave.

1:08:53.088 --> 1:08:54.839
[both in Spanish]
-Just leave already!

1:08:53.088 --> 1:08:54.839
-I'm here.

1:08:54.839 --> 1:08:58.175
[in Spanish]
I haven't gone anywhere!

1:08:54.839 --> 1:08:58.175
I'm here. I'm not going
anywhere without you.

1:09:00.177 --> 1:09:02.263
[both in Spanish]
-I don't believe you.

1:09:00.177 --> 1:09:02.263
-You don't...?

1:09:02.263 --> 1:09:05.475
[in Spanish]
Why don't you believe that

1:09:02.263 --> 1:09:05.475
people can fall in love
and stay together?

1:09:05.475 --> 1:09:07.518
[in Spanish]
You've seen one every day

1:09:05.475 --> 1:09:07.518
of your damn life.

1:09:07.518 --> 1:09:11.188
[in Spanish]
I do believe people can do it.

1:09:07.518 --> 1:09:11.188
Other people, lucky people.

1:09:11.188 --> 1:09:14.358
[in Spanish]
I clearly pissed off the stars

1:09:11.188 --> 1:09:14.358
at some point, hence you.

1:09:14.358 --> 1:09:16.694
[in Spanish]
I've seen it succeed once,

1:09:16.694 --> 1:09:18.780
[in Spanish]
fail every other time.

1:09:18.780 --> 1:09:21.491
[in Spanish]
Many women come into my

1:09:18.780 --> 1:09:21.491
office falling down in tears
'cause they hate

1:09:21.491 --> 1:09:24.201
[in Spanish]
the husband I saw them fawn

1:09:21.491 --> 1:09:24.201
over a couple of years before.

1:09:24.201 --> 1:09:26.079
[in Spanish]
I see husbands leave

1:09:24.201 --> 1:09:26.079
their menopausal wives

1:09:26.079 --> 1:09:27.956
[in Spanish]
and come back next month

1:09:26.079 --> 1:09:27.956
with their teen girlfriends.

1:09:27.956 --> 1:09:30.917
[in Spanish]
Right, 'cause we are all

1:09:27.956 --> 1:09:30.917
like that, right? I'm like that?

1:09:30.917 --> 1:09:34.211
[in Spanish]
No you're worse, you didn't even

1:09:30.917 --> 1:09:34.211
show up in the first place.

1:09:37.007 --> 1:09:38.716
[in Spanish]
I love you.

1:09:38.716 --> 1:09:39.759
[in Spanish]
you love me?

1:09:41.845 --> 1:09:43.220
[in Spanish]
Just as you did the first

1:09:41.845 --> 1:09:43.220
time which we learned
wasn't that much.

1:09:43.220 --> 1:09:45.222
[in Spanish]
God, Clara...

1:09:45.222 --> 1:09:47.475
[in Spanish]
What are you doing with

1:09:45.222 --> 1:09:47.475
that child in there?

1:09:47.475 --> 1:09:49.226
[both in Spanish]
-I like him.

1:09:47.475 --> 1:09:49.226
-Sure you like him!

1:09:49.226 --> 1:09:51.395
[in Spanish]
You like him like

1:09:49.226 --> 1:09:51.395
you like warm water.

1:09:51.395 --> 1:09:55.025
[in Spanish]
Please don't tell me you're

1:09:51.395 --> 1:09:55.025
with him 'cause he's easy,
because I swear--

1:09:55.025 --> 1:09:59.195
[in Spanish]
I'll tell you whatever I

1:09:55.025 --> 1:09:59.195
want, okay? Every time I
want to because

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:01.238
[in Spanish]
this is all your fault!

1:10:01.238 --> 1:10:05.242
[in Spanish]
This is all your fault!

1:10:01.238 --> 1:10:05.242
You come back here, all entitled

1:10:05.242 --> 1:10:07.244
[in Spanish]
saying I'm a liar.

1:10:07.244 --> 1:10:11.541
[in Spanish]
Ten years ago it was me standing

1:10:07.244 --> 1:10:11.541
right here feeding you

1:10:11.541 --> 1:10:13.918
[in Spanish]
this intense love line

1:10:11.541 --> 1:10:13.918
and you just left!

1:10:13.918 --> 1:10:17.130
[in Spanish]
You left and you took

1:10:13.918 --> 1:10:17.130
all of that with you.

1:10:17.130 --> 1:10:20.257
[in Spanish]
I'll be damned if I let

1:10:17.130 --> 1:10:20.257
you do that to me again!

1:10:20.257 --> 1:10:24.012
[in Spanish]
That's what I'm doing with

1:10:20.257 --> 1:10:24.012
him, okay? I'm trying to make
up for you.

1:10:24.012 --> 1:10:27.015
[in Spanish]
When he leaves, life will go on,

1:10:24.012 --> 1:10:27.015
no problem, but when you leave
again...

1:10:48.078 --> 1:10:50.287
It was wonderful
meeting everybody.

1:10:50.287 --> 1:10:51.873
Thank you for dinner
last night.

1:10:51.873 --> 1:10:54.250
It was beautiful.
Thank you.

1:10:55.292 --> 1:10:56.460
[door closes]

1:10:59.296 --> 1:11:01.841
Asher...

1:11:01.841 --> 1:11:04.301
Oh, oh, she's coming back.
She's coming back.

1:11:04.301 --> 1:11:06.096
Yep.

1:11:06.096 --> 1:11:07.555
Asher!

1:11:12.518 --> 1:11:15.188
Ash, wait!

1:11:15.188 --> 1:11:16.106
I'm sorry.

1:11:16.106 --> 1:11:17.607
Oh, it's fine.
It's fine.

1:11:17.607 --> 1:11:19.525
Hey, can you bring my stuff
to the hospital, please?

1:11:19.525 --> 1:11:20.985
I don't really feel like
going back inside.

1:11:20.985 --> 1:11:22.779
No, no, no.
Don't leave like this.

1:11:22.779 --> 1:11:23.905
-What?
-I'm sorry.

1:11:23.905 --> 1:11:25.489
How? How do you want
me to leave?

1:11:25.489 --> 1:11:27.324
-I'm sorry.
-What am I doing here?

1:11:27.324 --> 1:11:28.993
What are you
sorry for, what?

1:11:32.329 --> 1:11:33.539
I slept with him.

1:11:33.539 --> 1:11:36.126
I'm sorry
that I slept with him.

1:11:36.126 --> 1:11:38.711
You think that's
why I'm leaving?

1:11:38.711 --> 1:11:40.171
I know you slept
with him.

1:11:40.171 --> 1:11:42.339
I knew that the moment
I saw you two together.

1:11:42.339 --> 1:11:44.341
Come on, I'm not
that stupid, Clara.

1:11:44.341 --> 1:11:47.303
What? Then... what?

1:11:50.181 --> 1:11:52.516
You still think
you're using me.

1:11:52.516 --> 1:11:54.351
No, Asher, I'm not--

1:11:54.351 --> 1:11:58.481
I-- I know you're not,
but you don't.

1:11:58.481 --> 1:12:00.650
And as you stand here
and say it to me,

1:12:00.650 --> 1:12:03.987
you still think
you're lying to me.

1:12:03.987 --> 1:12:08.365
You think you're using me,
but actually you want me...

1:12:08.365 --> 1:12:09.826
in the same way
that you think

1:12:09.826 --> 1:12:11.869
you sleep around
to keep your distance,

1:12:11.869 --> 1:12:14.080
but in fact you're
looking for closeness,

1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:18.293
in the exact same way,
Clara, that you insult

1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:18.293
your patients.

1:12:18.293 --> 1:12:21.212
You think you do that
because you can't

1:12:18.293 --> 1:12:21.212
stand them.

1:12:21.212 --> 1:12:23.923
It's in fact because
you adore them.

1:12:26.509 --> 1:12:28.803
You don't know
yourself at all.

1:12:28.803 --> 1:12:31.681
No clue why
you do anything.

1:12:37.353 --> 1:12:39.939
It'd be adorable
if it wasn't so pathetic.

1:12:44.319 --> 1:12:47.363
[gentle music plays]

1:12:49.448 --> 1:12:51.868
[engine starts]

1:13:04.380 --> 1:13:07.591
[door opens, closes]

1:13:20.521 --> 1:13:22.232
[sighs]

1:13:28.487 --> 1:13:31.532
[in Spanish]
And you left my car

1:13:28.487 --> 1:13:31.532
in Los Angeles.

1:13:38.455 --> 1:13:41.000
[in Spanish]
Have you been feeling alright?

1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:42.418
[in Spanish]
Very well.

1:13:43.669 --> 1:13:45.629
[in Spanish]
Lilly, I wanted to apologize

1:13:45.629 --> 1:13:48.465
[in Spanish]
for what happened

1:13:45.629 --> 1:13:48.465
during our last consult.

1:13:48.465 --> 1:13:52.178
[in Spanish]
It was completely unprofessional

1:13:48.465 --> 1:13:52.178
of me and I'm so sorry.

1:13:55.348 --> 1:13:58.893
[both in Spanish]
-I wanted to wait

1:13:55.348 --> 1:13:58.893
until Beto got here...
-Beto's not coming.

1:13:58.893 --> 1:14:01.478
[both in Spanish]
-Did he have to work?

1:13:58.893 --> 1:14:01.478
-No.

1:14:01.478 --> 1:14:02.772
[in Spanish]
You were right.

1:14:05.316 --> 1:14:06.692
Mm.

1:14:06.776 --> 1:14:09.486
[both in Spanish]
-Lilly--

1:14:06.776 --> 1:14:09.486
-Speaking of which...

1:14:09.486 --> 1:14:12.448
[in Spanish]
since this is our last

1:14:09.486 --> 1:14:12.448
scheduled consult,

1:14:12.489 --> 1:14:17.120
[in Spanish]
I wanted to tell you that

1:14:12.489 --> 1:14:17.120
I changed my birth plan.

1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:19.038
[in Spanish]
I respect you tons,

1:14:19.038 --> 1:14:21.498
[in Spanish]
but I'll no longer

1:14:19.038 --> 1:14:21.498
need you there.

1:14:21.498 --> 1:14:23.960
[in Spanish]
I've spoken to doctor Malmet

1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:27.463
[in Spanish]
and I believe his energy

1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:27.463
will suit me better on the day.

1:14:28.631 --> 1:14:30.091
[in Spanish]
Of course.

1:14:30.091 --> 1:14:31.508
[in Spanish]
It's your plan.

1:14:31.508 --> 1:14:35.179
[in Spanish]
You should do what makes

1:14:31.508 --> 1:14:35.179
you comfortable...

1:14:35.179 --> 1:14:38.224
[both in Spanish]
-and doctor Malmet is excellent.

1:14:35.179 --> 1:14:38.224
-Can we begin?

1:14:39.434 --> 1:14:40.435
[in Spanish]
Sure.

1:14:45.522 --> 1:14:47.191
[door opens]

1:14:47.191 --> 1:14:48.151
[knocking]

1:14:48.151 --> 1:14:50.945
[Abby] Clara,
it's me and Bobby.

1:14:54.531 --> 1:14:55.658
[both in Spanish]
-Hello.

1:14:54.531 --> 1:14:55.658
-Hi

1:14:55.658 --> 1:14:57.743
[Bobby]<i> Tía</i> Clara,
you look terrible.

1:15:01.538 --> 1:15:03.333
[in Spanish]
Honey, do something for me.

1:15:03.333 --> 1:15:07.378
[in Spanish]
Go to your aunt's wardrobe and

1:15:03.333 --> 1:15:07.378
bring me some clothes to wear.

1:15:08.129 --> 1:15:09.130
[in Spanish]
Okay.

1:15:09.839 --> 1:15:10.840
[in Spanish]
Thanks.

1:15:13.592 --> 1:15:17.554
[in Spanish]
Please don't start. I'm sad,

he was the most gorgeous man,
