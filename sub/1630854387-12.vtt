WEBVTT

00:17.350 --> 00:18.309
They changed the code.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.520
What?

00:20.520 --> 00:22.313
We gotta get down there.
Keep trying.

00:24.482 --> 00:25.358
I've got this.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.613
No, wait.

00:48.047 --> 00:51.843
You have summoned me.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.852
Yes, I have.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.273
You had doubts.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.028
You hesitated.

01:11.905 --> 01:16.367
Your soul was racked by fear

01:16.367 --> 01:20.580
and weakened with confusion.

01:22.916 --> 01:23.833
It was.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.755
But you overcame that.

01:29.756 --> 01:35.720
You are the true son of Trigon.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.183
You're not angry about Mother?

01:43.478 --> 01:45.480
She was a vessel,

01:47.190 --> 01:49.442
nothing more.

01:52.070 --> 01:56.241
She told me that when you rose,

01:56.241 --> 01:59.828
we would rule together
as equals.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.210
But of course.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.129
He's lying.

02:13.132 --> 02:14.968
That's all he ever does,
is lie.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.266
Is she okay?

02:23.309 --> 02:24.978
She's done this
sort of thing before.

02:26.771 --> 02:27.689
I don't like it.

02:27.689 --> 02:28.690
Just give her some time.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.028
My daughter.

02:35.321 --> 02:39.367
I can't tell you
how glad I am to see you.

02:40.994 --> 02:45.790
I've thought of you. Often.

02:46.791 --> 02:47.876
I'm sure you have.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.173
Sebastian.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.719
You know you can't trust him.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.554
He will kill you.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.056
Why would you bring him here?

03:07.186 --> 03:08.605
He has something I need.

04:12.001 --> 04:12.919
Rachel,

04:17.048 --> 04:19.050
you're the only family
I have left now.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.179
So, what do you say, hmm?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.269
You and me against the world.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.312
You know I can't.

04:32.814 --> 04:33.898
You've gone too far.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.609
We're not family anymore.

04:39.570 --> 04:40.863
Well, that's a shame.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.394
You know,
Mom and Dad were delicious,

05:13.479 --> 05:15.982
but I think I still have
a little bit of room for you.

05:19.235 --> 05:22.530
Rachel, are you okay?

05:22.530 --> 05:24.657
Something happened to Conner.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.664
Trigon came back.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.584
And Brother Blood killed him.

05:36.335 --> 05:40.006
He... absorbed his power

05:40.006 --> 05:43.843
and his evil.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.554
It was like
he absorbed his soul.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.267
I don't know
how we're gonna stop him.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.915
Sebastian did this to him.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.583
He's not Sebastian anymore.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.211
Call him what he is.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.254
Brother Blood.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.049
Can you feel anything?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.098
No.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.227
Come on,
let's get him back to the RV.

06:47.281 --> 06:48.157
What is that?

06:50.118 --> 06:54.330
Red Kryptonite
combined with nitroglycerin
and epinephrine.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.666
S.T.A.R. Labs
had it designed
to stabilize Kal-El

06:56.666 --> 06:58.084
if the worst ever happened.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.086
Will it work?

07:00.086 --> 07:02.463
I don't know.
It's never been used.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.780
Now what?

07:59.478 --> 08:01.189
Mark Hopkins Hotel?

08:01.189 --> 08:03.191
I'd like to make a reservation
for the Top of the Mark, please.

08:03.941 --> 08:04.859
This Friday night.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.201
Six. Party of six.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.580
Seven o'clock's fine.
Thank you.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.215
We'll be there.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.808
Remember the first day we met?

08:37.808 --> 08:40.394
At the roller rink. Yeah.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.775
Yeah, I really didn't like you.

08:48.694 --> 08:49.654
I didn't like you either.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.490
Why not?

08:53.574 --> 08:54.992
'Cause you stole my car.

08:54.992 --> 08:58.246
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, sorry about that.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.043
I'm really glad
I took the time
to get to know you.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.675
Sounds like
you're trying to say goodbye.

09:18.975 --> 09:19.850
Please don't.

09:23.938 --> 09:24.855
We're not there.

09:28.067 --> 09:28.943
Maybe we are.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.748
I'm not liking this.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.709
Well, there's not a lot
to like.

09:48.254 --> 09:52.341
I think
Kory's really planning
on sacrificing herself.

09:52.341 --> 09:55.136
Well, maybe Dick's right.
Maybe there's another way.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.263
Like what?

10:01.017 --> 10:03.936
There.
Dick, I have eyes on him.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.857
Chemical warehouse. Rail yards.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.487
Why is he going there?

10:13.487 --> 10:16.782
Because it's not
just a chemical warehouse,
it's a government black site.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.287
They're storing
biochemical weapons.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.248
Kory, change of plans.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.753
Looks like
everyone left in a hurry.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.380
The biochemical materials
must be stored
in the underground bunker.

10:31.922 --> 10:33.382
Come on.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.342
Hey, guys.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.513
Nice. Very nice.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.475
Robin 3.0.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.607
What do you think?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.110
Third time's the charm.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.280
You shouldn't have come here.

11:09.794 --> 11:10.961
Is that all you got?

11:11.962 --> 11:12.797
Fuck this dude.

11:12.797 --> 11:13.964
Double fuck this dude.

11:22.014 --> 11:22.973
It was an illusion.

11:23.891 --> 11:24.934
He was never really here.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.145
Are you sure?

11:41.117 --> 11:42.493
The whole thing
was a distraction.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.204
From what?

11:57.591 --> 12:01.512
<i>Welcome to S.T.A.R. Labs.
Making tomorrow, today.</i>

12:05.724 --> 12:08.811
<i>All international metahuman
conference delegates,</i>

12:08.811 --> 12:10.855
<i>please report
to conference room 12.</i>

12:12.731 --> 12:13.607
Sebastian.

12:22.783 --> 12:23.742
What are you doing here?

12:25.786 --> 12:30.124
Ah. Hello, Dr. Espenson.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.671
I was just stopping by
because I heard

12:35.671 --> 12:38.257
that S.T.A.R. Labs
was instrumental
in shutting down

12:38.257 --> 12:39.592
the game I developed.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.596
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.974
It was the only thing
that mattered to me.

12:49.185 --> 12:54.106
The one good and pure
part of myself

12:54.106 --> 12:55.983
that I wanted to share
with the world,

12:55.983 --> 12:57.776
but that didn't matter to you,
did it?

12:59.778 --> 13:00.654
Did it?

13:03.449 --> 13:05.910
<i>Unsanctioned metahuman
detected in main lobby.</i>

13:23.844 --> 13:25.054
You need to leave.

13:26.764 --> 13:30.476
If people like you
had just been a little bit
nicer to me,

13:31.685 --> 13:33.521
none of this
would've had to happen.

13:36.982 --> 13:40.236
None of that matters anymore,
does it?

13:43.531 --> 13:47.743
<i>I'm going to need access
to your Icarus Lab.</i>

13:58.087 --> 14:00.714
But let's just keep that
between you and me, hmm?

14:10.724 --> 14:11.809
Well, that works, too.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.612
Any sign?

14:23.612 --> 14:25.114
Nothing.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.908
We've checked news feeds,
residual spectral signatures.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.451
Both negative.

14:32.746 --> 14:35.249
Holy shit. Bernard.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.961
Yeah, it's me. Hi. Um...

14:40.004 --> 14:41.380
we've got trouble.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.840
<i>Hang on,
let me put you on speaker.</i>

14:43.882 --> 14:44.758
It's Bernard.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.136
Are you okay?

14:47.136 --> 14:48.637
Brother Blood is here.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.098
Gar, S.T.A.R. Labs.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.182
Yeah, I'm on it.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.144
<i>It's bad. Um, and...</i>

14:56.937 --> 15:00.149
He killed everyone he saw.
And it's only luck
he didn't see me.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.900
What is he doing now?

15:01.900 --> 15:03.611
He's headed to the Icarus Lab.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.238
What's the Icarus Lab?

15:08.365 --> 15:09.825
Dick, we need to tell them.

15:15.914 --> 15:18.375
All right, go ahead.

15:18.375 --> 15:23.380
S.T.A.R. Labs
has always been about
the betterment of mankind.

15:23.380 --> 15:28.469
We debate
our research and development
and the possible consequences

15:28.469 --> 15:30.971
of our actions.

15:30.971 --> 15:34.975
Project Icarus is as close
to the line as we've ever gone.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.186
Does anyone else hate
where this is going?

15:37.186 --> 15:38.646
Dick, you wanna catch us up?

15:41.357 --> 15:42.232
It's a wormhole.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.321
Sorry, you mean like...
A wormhole?

15:47.321 --> 15:49.031
<i>Pretty much. Yeah.</i>

15:49.031 --> 15:52.076
The Icarus Gate
is controllable.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.744
It's programmable.

15:53.744 --> 15:57.039
It allows for any object
to be sent anywhere
in the universe.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.667
<i>From something as small as
a single atom</i>

15:59.667 --> 16:01.543
to as large as
an entire planet.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.129
<i>I just sent you the data.</i>

16:04.129 --> 16:08.050
It's completely operational.
Except for one small problem.

16:08.050 --> 16:11.220
There isn't enough energy
on Earth to run it.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.556
Why would Brother Blood
want access to a wormhole?

16:14.556 --> 16:16.225
He wants to destroy Tamaran.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.478
We represent everything
he's not.

16:21.480 --> 16:25.025
He can't rule until
there's no trace of us left.
Gar, stop the RV.

16:27.986 --> 16:28.821
Kory, wait!

16:39.707 --> 16:41.125
You trying
to steal my car again?

16:41.125 --> 16:42.626
You knew
about the Icarus Lab?

16:44.253 --> 16:47.756
I knew it existed.
I didn't know
this was gonna happen.

16:47.756 --> 16:52.094
It's not just Tamaran,
you know.
It's Earth too.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.471
He's gonna destroy both.
I have to stop him.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.598
No, we have to stop him.

17:01.019 --> 17:02.146
I have a plan.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.939
Better be a damn good one.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.649
Bernard thinks
he can get us inside the lab.

17:05.649 --> 17:08.318
Once we're in,
we can destroy the Icarus Gate.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.195
Brother Blood can't use it
if you blow it up.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.697
Hmm.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.782
We save Earth, save Tamaran.
Live to fight another day.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.951
It's just putting off
the inevitable.

17:15.951 --> 17:19.496
Maybe. Maybe not.
But at least with my plan,
no one has to die. Not today.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.083
Okay. Fine.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.338
But I'm going alone.

17:28.338 --> 17:31.258
Bad idea.
He knows you're coming.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.302
You could get killed
before you get a shot off.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.430
I'm done asking anyone else
to risk their lives
to stop him.

17:36.430 --> 17:39.475
It's not
your decision to make,
it's theirs.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.310
We're stronger together,
you know we are.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.648
But we're even on me
stealing your car.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.155
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

17:53.155 --> 17:55.282
<i>All personnel
evacuate S.T.A.R. Labs</i>

17:55.282 --> 17:56.909
<i>and seek shelter.</i>

17:56.909 --> 18:00.704
<i>This is not a drill.
Repeat, this is not a drill.</i>

18:10.756 --> 18:14.384
<i>Unknown presence detected.
Please identify.</i>

18:15.344 --> 18:17.012
My name is Brother Blood.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.102
And I'm going
to change the world.

18:29.817 --> 18:33.946
<i>Good evening.
My name is Calliope.
How may I help you?</i>

18:35.239 --> 18:36.365
Calliope.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.245
I need to engage
your Icarus Gate.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.206
<i>What is the password?</i>

18:51.839 --> 18:56.927
Azarath Metrion Zinthos.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.931
<i>Password accepted.</i>

19:11.942 --> 19:16.697
The Icarus Gate is not working
at full capacity, is it?

19:16.697 --> 19:20.534
<i>No.
The Icarus Gate requires
1,000 zettajoules</i>

19:20.534 --> 19:22.286
<i>to become fully operative.</i>

19:24.246 --> 19:27.958
Equivalent to the thermal solar
output of 10,000 suns.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.794
<i>Ten thousand and eighty-nine
Earth suns.</i>

19:36.174 --> 19:41.597
If a Tamaranean
were to use their power
in this room,

19:42.848 --> 19:45.225
would that be enough
to activate the Gate?

19:45.225 --> 19:48.228
<i>Correct.
A typical Tamaranean
can generate</i>

19:48.228 --> 19:51.106
<i>well over
1,000 zettajoules of energy.</i>

20:17.716 --> 20:19.760
Bernard.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.096
You okay?

20:23.096 --> 20:24.598
Yeah. I'm fine.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.647
Where is the Icarus Lab?

20:32.397 --> 20:34.024
The top floor.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.692
Well, if we're gonna do this,
let's do it.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.031
I'll be back, okay?

20:43.617 --> 20:44.785
Sooner or later,

20:48.497 --> 20:50.707
we all have to face our demons.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.504
By now, Brother Blood
probably knows we're coming.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.548
Once we're inside,
distract him for
as long as possible.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.676
Long enough for Kory
to destroy the gate.

21:13.897 --> 21:15.649
Bernard, what have you got?

21:15.649 --> 21:19.069
All right. Keep heading
for the north staircase.
It's all clear.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.071
If he's got any surprises,
I'm not seeing them.

21:28.286 --> 21:29.162
Kory.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.960
Dick. Dick!

21:37.379 --> 21:38.338
Kory's gone.

21:39.756 --> 21:41.091
Tim! Gar!

21:42.300 --> 21:43.176
Kory!

22:11.830 --> 22:14.916
Kory! Kory!

22:14.916 --> 22:17.210
Tim! Anything?

22:17.210 --> 22:18.754
She's not down here.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.881
You don't think
she'd go off on her own,
do you?

22:20.881 --> 22:22.090
No, she would've
said something.

22:22.090 --> 22:23.383
There's gotta be
another reason.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.136
Nightwing, I see her.

22:26.136 --> 22:30.265
She's outside the Icarus Lab.
But... something's wrong.

22:30.265 --> 22:33.810
There's a metahuman
assault squad
guarding the door.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.274
<i>Gentlemen,
allow my guest to pass.</i>

22:49.743 --> 22:51.787
Why would
he bring her up there?
She could kill him.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.121
Not if he's controlling her.

22:53.121 --> 22:55.540
Why not put a spell
on all of us?

22:55.540 --> 22:57.209
'Cause he needs her
for something.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.211
Oh, my God, Dick.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.174
Starfire's not his problem,
she's his solution.

23:04.174 --> 23:06.093
He's gonna try to use her
to power the Gate.

23:37.499 --> 23:38.375
Hello, Kory.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.755
I bet you wish you killed me
when you had the chance.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.011
Back then
you weren't Brother Blood.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.889
You deserved the right
to make a choice
about your future.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.976
This is who I always was.

23:57.435 --> 23:59.563
You just liked me better
when I was weak.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.569
Look.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.949
Earth and Tamaran
will finally meet.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.869
When the Gate is fully charged,

24:13.869 --> 24:17.998
I am going to send
this garbage-covered
excuse for a planet

24:17.998 --> 24:22.377
hurtling through space
to destroy a diamond.

24:23.670 --> 24:24.629
Sebastian.

24:27.174 --> 24:31.428
Destroying Earth and Tamaran
was your father's goal.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.724
It was never yours.

24:35.724 --> 24:39.352
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

24:39.352 --> 24:43.440
When you murder someone
and you drink
their life's blood

24:43.440 --> 24:44.858
from their beating heart,

24:46.818 --> 24:48.612
you really get to know them.

24:52.199 --> 24:55.744
It turns out,
my father's deepest fear
was that one day,

24:55.744 --> 25:00.165
the people of Earth
and the people of Tamaran
would join forces.

25:00.165 --> 25:04.377
And he knew that
if that happened,
they would be unbeatable.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.841
I won't let anyone
have power over me.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.052
Never again.

25:13.845 --> 25:16.765
<i>Icarus Gate
targeting computations complete.</i>

25:19.351 --> 25:20.227
Yeah.

25:22.270 --> 25:26.233
You're thinking of
destroying it, aren't you? Hmm?

25:31.863 --> 25:33.531
Or maybe...

25:38.203 --> 25:43.500
Maybe you're thinking of
sacrificing yourself
to destroy me.

25:46.086 --> 25:49.130
Either way it doesn't matter.

25:49.130 --> 25:53.510
Any light
you release in this room
will be instantly absorbed

25:53.510 --> 25:58.098
by the Gate's power coil,
bringing it to full capacity.

26:00.517 --> 26:03.728
It's waiting for your energy, Starfire.

26:07.315 --> 26:08.650
It's hungry for it.

26:10.735 --> 26:14.614
And you're the only person
on Earth who can feed it.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.037
So how does this end?

26:23.957 --> 26:29.629
I use my blue light.
The Earth goes into a wormhole
and you die.

26:30.338 --> 26:31.589
Gods don't die.

26:33.550 --> 26:34.592
You're no god.

26:34.592 --> 26:35.927
I am a god!

26:39.639 --> 26:40.890
My whole life.

26:42.600 --> 26:47.939
My whole life,
all I ever wanted
was love and acceptance,

26:47.939 --> 26:51.943
and all I got in return
was cruelty and pain.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.698
It took me a long time
to realize that

26:56.698 --> 27:00.827
cruelty and pain
are the only true principles
of existence.

27:03.079 --> 27:06.082
And you either suffer them,

27:09.127 --> 27:10.503
or you inflict them.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.300
It's time
for other people to suffer.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.303
I'm done suffering.

27:21.639 --> 27:25.310
Let's get started, shall we?

27:34.361 --> 27:36.946
Six. Armed. Riot gear.

27:39.949 --> 27:41.034
We're gonna need some cover.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.295
Firing positions.

27:55.131 --> 27:56.091
Go.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.909
I won't help you destroy
my home.

28:26.704 --> 28:27.789
Either one of them.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.293
Yes, you will.

28:47.725 --> 28:50.603
<i>Icarus Gate
power sequence initiated.</i>

29:34.814 --> 29:35.648
Bernard!

29:42.447 --> 29:44.491
I might be able
to hack my way in.

29:44.491 --> 29:45.992
<i>Anytime!</i>

29:45.992 --> 29:47.535
Almost there.

29:47.535 --> 29:49.120
Bernard!

29:52.081 --> 29:54.626
<i>Power is at 17%.</i>

30:01.299 --> 30:03.593
The irony is irresistible,
isn't it?

30:10.475 --> 30:13.394
The one
whom the prophecy states
would save worlds

30:13.394 --> 30:14.562
will now destroy them.

30:18.650 --> 30:22.904
<i>Wormhole to Tamaran
will be charged in 320 seconds.</i>

30:24.239 --> 30:27.742
You see,
destinies can be rewritten.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.621
It just depends
who holds the pen.

30:31.621 --> 30:33.748
<i>Power is at 22%.</i>

30:47.095 --> 30:49.264
<i>Power is at 27%.</i>

30:49.264 --> 30:50.932
Kory!

30:50.932 --> 30:52.934
Bernard, he's got
Starfire hooked up
to some kind of machine.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.227
He's draining her!

30:54.227 --> 30:55.687
How do we shut it down?

30:55.687 --> 30:57.272
You're gonna have to get close
but be careful.

30:57.272 --> 31:00.066
The gravitational pull
can be very unpredictable.

31:00.066 --> 31:03.069
Look for four black cables
just beneath the Gate.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.948
I see them!

31:10.201 --> 31:12.745
<i>Power is at 30%.</i>

31:12.745 --> 31:15.415
Those black cables,
they're the navigational
guidance system.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.834
If you pull them out,
he won't be able
to target Tamaran.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.634
<i>First cable down,
three to go.</i>

31:27.927 --> 31:29.554
Bernard, I can't shut it down.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.098
Brother Blood has locked down
the entire mainframe.

31:32.098 --> 31:34.559
<i>Power is at 43%.</i>

31:51.242 --> 31:54.829
For the record,
that game you made
fucking sucks.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.837
<i>Wormhole initial ignition commencing.</i>

32:10.178 --> 32:12.764
<i>Gar, how are we
doing with that second cable?</i>

32:12.764 --> 32:14.098
<i>I'm working on it!</i>

32:15.642 --> 32:17.185
<i>Two more cables
to go, Gar.</i>

32:17.185 --> 32:18.853
<i>Power is at 70%.</i>

32:18.853 --> 32:22.065
Okay.
I'm gonna help you.
Let me help you.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.373
Help!

32:38.373 --> 32:40.958
Go help Beast Boy.
He's getting sucked in!

32:53.888 --> 32:56.599
<i>Tamaranean solar system arrival imminent.</i>

33:00.186 --> 33:02.271
<i>Power is at 84%.</i>

33:06.484 --> 33:08.361
No, no.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.893
- Come on.
- <i>Planet Tamaran now
in range of Icarus Wormhole.</i>

33:40.893 --> 33:42.729
We don't have
much time left!

33:42.729 --> 33:43.771
Help me with these cables!

33:43.771 --> 33:45.106
Okay!

33:47.108 --> 33:49.444
<i>Power is at 95%.</i>

33:51.279 --> 33:52.697
<i>Commencing primary ignition.</i>

34:08.963 --> 34:11.007
Hey. Hey.

34:13.509 --> 34:15.636
<i>Wormhole activation ready.</i>

34:15.636 --> 34:20.308
<i>Earth targeted to Tamaran.
Ready to execute
on your command.</i>

34:20.308 --> 34:26.898
Did you really think
you had a chance?
You can't beat me!

34:27.899 --> 34:29.942
No. But he can.

34:42.663 --> 34:45.249
<i>Targeting system failure.</i>

35:15.655 --> 35:17.281
Rachel.

35:32.171 --> 35:33.089
You're alive.

35:34.423 --> 35:35.508
Damn straight.

35:36.551 --> 35:40.304
Wait, was I dead?

35:41.722 --> 35:42.765
I'll explain later.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.310
Are you okay?

35:52.859 --> 35:53.776
I don't think so.

36:04.287 --> 36:09.709
It's over.
The prophecies, the story. Everything.

36:11.836 --> 36:12.879
We won.

36:14.755 --> 36:16.841
We can toss him
into the Icarus Gate.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.385
Blast him back
to the other side
of the universe.

36:19.385 --> 36:20.595
Conner, give me a hand!

36:21.846 --> 36:22.680
No.

36:33.274 --> 36:35.067
What if he comes back?

36:36.611 --> 36:37.528
Stronger.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.489
Then we'll be stronger too.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.245
There's a flame
lit inside of me.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.416
I can't just put it out
and restart it.

36:53.085 --> 36:53.961
I'm sorry...

36:58.007 --> 36:58.966
But it's time.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.889
There's always an end.

37:08.267 --> 37:11.354
I don't know
how to do that.

37:13.731 --> 37:14.649
I know.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.653
I can't.

37:19.904 --> 37:23.616
Me neither.
Let's just wing it.

37:25.493 --> 37:26.619
No.

37:30.623 --> 37:31.499
No.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.045
This is my story.

37:37.713 --> 37:41.259
You don't get
to be the fucking heroes!

37:57.733 --> 37:58.609
Kory!

38:45.948 --> 38:47.491
Oh, how about this one?

38:49.326 --> 38:52.621
Hey, buddy, want a snack?
Got one for me,

38:54.123 --> 38:55.249
and one for you.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.628
Oh, it's so perfect.

38:59.628 --> 39:03.090
Okay, so let me
get this straight.
You've got Santa Claus.

39:03.090 --> 39:06.344
His reindeer. Talking snowmen.
And Jesus?

39:06.344 --> 39:07.261
Basically.

39:07.261 --> 39:08.971
And Grinch and Scrooge.

39:08.971 --> 39:12.016
That's a store, I think.

39:12.016 --> 39:15.770
It's a very old story,
and it starts,
like all good stories,

39:15.770 --> 39:17.355
with a star in the East.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.815
A star? I like it already.

39:19.815 --> 39:24.779
Well, spoiler alert.
It ends like this,
be kind to your fellow man.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.113
And Tamaranean.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.074
- And Kryptonians.
- And animals.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.617
And half-demons.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.286
Okay, well,
everyone just be kind.

39:32.286 --> 39:37.333
Speaking of everyone,
I'm convinced the whole world
is divided into two groups...

39:37.333 --> 39:38.667
Mm-hmm. Good and evil.

39:38.667 --> 39:40.795
Yeah, not quite
what I'm talking about.

39:40.795 --> 39:44.298
Christmas morning people
and Christmas Eve people.

39:44.298 --> 39:46.634
I am definitely Christmas Eve.

39:46.634 --> 39:47.968
Don't ask him.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.970
No, I need to know.
What's the difference?

39:49.970 --> 39:52.473
Oh, Christmas morning people
are all about the presents, right?

39:52.473 --> 39:53.891
The instant gratification.

39:53.891 --> 39:56.268
But Christmas Eve
is all about the hope,

39:56.268 --> 39:58.312
the excitement,
the anticipation,

39:58.312 --> 40:02.108
because all the good things
are still in the future,
yet to come.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.567
- Oh.
- I like that.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.152
Yeah.

40:05.152 --> 40:07.863
Here's to all the good things
in the future, yet to come.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.743
- Cheers.
- Cheers to that.

40:12.743 --> 40:13.702
Cheers.

40:44.233 --> 40:45.317
She saved us.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.034
She saved everything.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.510
Dick,

41:13.637 --> 41:14.555
come on.

42:19.954 --> 42:20.996
I thought I'd lost you.

42:22.581 --> 42:25.251
Me too.

42:47.564 --> 42:48.941
Whoa.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.569
Guys.

42:52.569 --> 42:54.738
Aw.

43:18.470 --> 43:22.224
Welcome to the Top of the Mark.
Right this way, Mr. Grayson.

43:22.224 --> 43:23.392
<i>♪ Heaven ♪</i>

43:26.937 --> 43:28.063
Wow.

43:28.063 --> 43:30.607
- After you.
- Thank you.

43:30.607 --> 43:33.068
I gotta say,
this looks better than
bowling alley pizza.

43:33.068 --> 43:34.778
That pizza was fantastic.

43:34.778 --> 43:36.697
I don't know. We'll see.

43:36.697 --> 43:39.867
Hey, before we get started,
there's something
I gotta tell you guys.

43:39.867 --> 43:44.747
I'm, uh... leaving.

43:48.167 --> 43:49.918
What are you talking about?

43:49.918 --> 43:52.171
<i>There are some things
I still need to do.</i>

43:52.171 --> 43:54.298
- In The Red?
- In The Red.

43:56.216 --> 43:57.593
You're serious?

43:57.593 --> 43:58.886
I got some answers,

43:58.886 --> 44:00.304
<i>but there were
more questions raised.</i>

44:01.930 --> 44:03.307
<i>I think they need
me there, too.</i>

44:05.559 --> 44:06.894
How long will you be gone?

44:07.811 --> 44:08.729
I don't know.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.815
But I won't be too far.

44:11.815 --> 44:14.193
If you guys ever need me,
I'll be there.

44:14.193 --> 44:15.402
Like that.

44:17.488 --> 44:18.864
You know what?
This is a good thing.

44:18.864 --> 44:20.616
This is what's supposed
to happen.

44:20.616 --> 44:23.494
If we stayed
in the same place,
we never would have met.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.329
I'm so glad
you said that, Dick.

44:25.329 --> 44:27.289
'Cause I've been thinking
about the future, too.

44:27.289 --> 44:28.290
Oh, God.

44:28.290 --> 44:29.875
What?

44:29.875 --> 44:33.253
Well, just for a while there,
I was a normal kid.

44:33.253 --> 44:35.464
Have you ever
been normal?

44:35.464 --> 44:41.637
Shut up.
Point is, I did something that
I never thought that I'd do.

44:41.637 --> 44:43.847
I applied for college.

44:43.847 --> 44:45.682
Oh, nice. Yes.

44:48.018 --> 44:49.436
Where are you going?

44:49.436 --> 44:51.522
<i>It's a little
community college</i>

44:51.522 --> 44:54.066
<i>just outside
of Gotham called,
uh, Bludhaven University.</i>

44:54.066 --> 44:55.109
<i>Bludhaven?</i>

44:55.109 --> 44:56.944
<i>Sounds cool, right?</i>

44:56.944 --> 44:58.946
I just thought
it was time for me
to spend some time

44:58.946 --> 45:01.573
around regular kids, you know?

45:01.573 --> 45:04.701
It's not... it's not far.
You guys can all visit.

45:05.202 --> 45:06.453
I'll fly.

45:06.453 --> 45:08.330
Yeah, you fly.
I'll have to drive the RV.

45:08.330 --> 45:11.959
Take the Porsche,
it's faster.

45:11.959 --> 45:14.128
Hey, Rach, I'm gonna see you
all the time,

45:14.128 --> 45:15.421
'cause I'm gonna
be around there, too

45:15.421 --> 45:16.964
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

45:16.964 --> 45:18.173
Where the hell
are you going?

45:18.173 --> 45:19.633
You said this was a good thing.

45:19.633 --> 45:21.427
Yeah, it is.
Just not everyone all at once.

45:21.427 --> 45:25.139
Here's the thing.
Robin is a responsibility.

45:26.890 --> 45:28.809
<i>And tied to Gotham.</i>

45:28.809 --> 45:31.437
But I got a life
in Metropolis too.

45:34.523 --> 45:35.566
Nice sparring.

45:38.777 --> 45:40.320
Guess the Boy Wonder
will be in both cities.

45:42.072 --> 45:43.574
All right. Go ahead.
You're next.

45:43.574 --> 45:45.534
Where the hell are you going?

45:45.534 --> 45:49.163
Back to Metropolis.
Superman wants me
to spend some time with him.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.918
<i>He says he owes me one
from last time.</i>

46:01.133 --> 46:02.009
Whoa.

46:03.552 --> 46:05.846
Maybe I'll finally get
those flying lessons after all.

46:05.846 --> 46:07.681
- Yeah.
- Wow.

46:11.518 --> 46:13.437
Guess you never know
what the future holds, huh?

46:16.565 --> 46:17.483
I guess not.

46:25.574 --> 46:28.076
- All right, who's hungry?
Let's eat.
- I am.

46:56.730 --> 46:57.648
Scotch?

46:59.066 --> 47:03.070
Lagavulin.
It's what Lex drinks.

47:03.070 --> 47:04.154
How does it taste?

47:09.326 --> 47:11.411
About as good as it sounds.

47:11.411 --> 47:13.247
You wanna head back
to the table?

47:13.247 --> 47:15.958
Gar's about to order
every single dessert
on the menu.

47:18.961 --> 47:20.254
I'm not the same guy.

47:24.383 --> 47:25.384
As what?

47:26.760 --> 47:28.679
As the guy Clark wanted
to meet.

47:31.515 --> 47:32.516
None of us are the same.

47:33.976 --> 47:35.310
Come on.

47:37.187 --> 47:38.897
And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

47:41.275 --> 47:42.693
You're afraid he won't approve?

47:46.738 --> 47:47.739
I don't approve.

47:51.702 --> 47:53.537
Look, you should ask yourself
one question.

47:54.371 --> 47:55.956
The things you did,

47:55.956 --> 47:58.959
the things you did
where you might have
crossed the line,

47:58.959 --> 48:01.795
did you do it for yourself?
Or to help other people?

48:03.672 --> 48:06.174
What does it matter?
I still did it.

48:06.174 --> 48:07.968
Yeah, but the why is important.

48:10.721 --> 48:14.349
Real bad guys out there?
They never ask that question.

48:16.727 --> 48:17.936
So, keep asking it.

48:38.915 --> 48:42.127
It's just weird, isn't it?

48:42.127 --> 48:43.045
What?

48:44.421 --> 48:45.964
- You and I alone together?
- Yeah.

48:47.382 --> 48:48.884
A little.

48:48.884 --> 48:50.344
I'm excited for them.

48:50.344 --> 48:52.429
- They're not even
leaving us Krypto.
- I...

48:54.389 --> 48:56.642
We'll survive. Somehow.

49:00.646 --> 49:02.898
So, can I buy you a coffee?

49:02.898 --> 49:05.359
You can buy me another drink.

49:05.359 --> 49:08.195
Gosh, this night
really is full of surprises.

49:15.077 --> 49:16.620
Do you remember
what Sebastian said?

49:16.620 --> 49:18.914
About humans
and Tamaraneans
getting together?

49:20.874 --> 49:23.418
That if they ever did,
they'd be unstoppable.

49:26.505 --> 49:27.798
Maybe we should get on that.

49:39.434 --> 49:43.271
Okay, let me buy
you a drink first.
Just one step at a time, huh?

49:43.271 --> 49:44.898
Well, you're paying...

49:44.898 --> 49:46.608
- ...for once.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

49:47.526 --> 49:49.236
Thank you.

49:49.236 --> 49:55.367
<i>♪ It's cause heaven
Must be missing an angel ♪</i>

49:57.285 --> 49:59.871
<i>♪ Missing one angel, child ♪</i>

49:59.871 --> 50:03.208
<i>♪ Cause you're here with me
Right now ♪</i>

50:06.545 --> 50:09.631
Yeah! Whoo!
