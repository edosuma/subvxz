00:42.694 --> 00:45.325
Ladies and gentlemen,
on your feet.

00:45.349 --> 00:50.615
The whole list of drivers for
the Indianapolis 500-mile race.

00:59.581 --> 01:01.733
We don't turn up
to just do a job.

01:01.757 --> 01:05.867
We turn up to win and, you know,
win as many races as we can.

01:05.891 --> 01:08.371
And you know, win as many
championships, 500's, whatever it is.

01:10.505 --> 01:13.160
You know, that's what it's all
about, you know, is just winning.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.077
That's why I do it.

01:22.473 --> 01:24.799
We just don't talk about
the dangers, really.

01:24.823 --> 01:27.411
It's, like, we just don't.

01:27.435 --> 01:32.396
I'd like to sometimes, but I don't
want to put that into his head either.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.984
I've married a guy that,

01:36.008 --> 01:40.598
unless he's going really
fast, he doesn't feel alive.

01:46.367 --> 01:49.674
He feels euphoric when
he's chancing death.

01:55.027 --> 02:00.120
232.595 on the lap
speed for Scott Dixon.

02:03.253 --> 02:04.733
Yeah! Yeah, baby.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.740
This is an incredible
start for Scott Dixon.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.460
One and a half to go
for Chip Ganassi,

02:16.484 --> 02:18.790
watching his driver,
Scott Dixon.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.619
Such a disciplined driver.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.603
Another in the 232's.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.848
And the roar of the crowd.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.709
That was perfection.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.996
Checkered flag for Scott Dixon.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.717
And a new number to
the top of the board.

02:56.741 --> 03:01.157
232.164 miles an hour

03:01.181 --> 03:04.334
for four laps around the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

03:04.358 --> 03:08.294
Scott Dixon records the fastest
speed in over 20 years.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.167
Congratulations. The good news
is you didn't have to wait long.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.779
Mate. Sweet. Chip Ganassi comes
up, gives him congratulations.

03:14.803 --> 03:18.609
They have got the pole here for the
101st running of the Indy 500.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.872
I got to ask, how does it feel?
It feels, uh...

03:20.896 --> 03:23.266
You did it, bro.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.529
Nice job, buddy. Nice job.

03:32.821 --> 03:36.540
Dixon's garage. The
garage is now open.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.653
The garage is now open.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.935
Ready to roll. Ready to roll.

04:00.936 --> 04:03.001
Start pressuring them.

04:03.025 --> 04:05.245
Check the pressures
on me babies.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.835
5:15.

04:10.859 --> 04:13.949
What will we know in 12 hours?

04:36.014 --> 04:40.995
Performance come
off the tires...

04:41.019 --> 04:45.348
Hours before the race, I've already
switched off from the family life

04:45.372 --> 04:49.419
and just totally focused and
thinking about only racing.

04:56.034 --> 04:59.710
When I start to get nervous
or anxious about the race,

04:59.734 --> 05:01.973
I typically get quite quiet.

05:01.997 --> 05:04.105
Uh, I don't talk to
too many people.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.784
And it's... it's just, you know,
thinking about a lot of things.

05:13.965 --> 05:18.381
I've been with this team for 16 years.
So they're like family.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.961
Like, I've known these
people for a long time,

05:20.973 --> 05:23.540
maybe longer than some
of my best friends.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.931
You know, you need a lot of
confidence in motor racing,

05:46.955 --> 05:49.020
especially in the people that
you're working with that,

05:49.044 --> 05:51.936
you know, the cars are safe, they're
gonna be mechanically sound.

05:51.960 --> 05:56.051
And, in a lot of ways, you are
putting your life in their hands.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.337
We're good to fire up here, TK?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.947
Radio check, Scott.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.731
10-4. Loud and clear.

06:04.755 --> 06:07.821
If you're a driver, it
is not all about you.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.979
You may be the focus, but the great
thing is, I think Scott's aware...

06:12.241 --> 06:14.330
that it's not just about him.

06:19.291 --> 06:23.731
And without all those people
backing him up, not gonna happen.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.468
He is the glue of the team.

06:45.492 --> 06:46.971
The team revolves around Scott.

06:52.977 --> 06:55.347
When you're driving a racing
car, it's all about balance.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.044
You know, everybody
talks about balance.

06:57.068 --> 07:00.657
And that's the front rear end
sliding a bit more than the other.

07:00.681 --> 07:03.964
And Scott will set the car
up so the rear is sliding.

07:03.988 --> 07:06.271
He loves the rear
of the car sliding.

07:06.295 --> 07:10.928
He-He loves that, sort of, right on
the edge feeling with-with the car.

07:10.952 --> 07:14.018
It gives the team such a
lift to watch him do that.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.436
You know you've got a guy there
that can do the exceptional.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.704
All right, everybody here?

07:26.271 --> 07:27.751
Okay. Good Morning.

07:30.972 --> 07:35.648
Between now and, uh, the checkered flag,
I'd like everybody to focus on one thing,

07:35.672 --> 07:39.154
and one thing only...
Winning this race.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.699
Put everything else
outside of your mind,

07:42.723 --> 07:45.073
everything we have to do
to win this race today.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.624
Yeah. Thanks.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.582
Can I help you with that? Yeah.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.541
It's always something simple, Kate.
We're still figuring it out.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.194
What did you do, Kate?

08:00.218 --> 08:01.805
I'm here to help you, Kate.
What did you do?

08:01.829 --> 08:03.459
We got it all the
way on the back.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.939
Race has been part of
my life since birth.

08:05.963 --> 08:08.159
It's always been in my family.

08:08.183 --> 08:11.771
When you start to make it more
than a passion, more than a hobby,

08:11.795 --> 08:15.582
when you start making it a career
or a lifestyle permanently...

08:16.800 --> 08:19.281
you pursue perfection.

08:21.675 --> 08:26.003
It's a bizarre phenomenon that... that
human beings want to compete constantly

08:26.027 --> 08:30.205
and prove that they're the best or
just master whatever is in their path.

08:32.337 --> 08:36.404
It's easy to say you pursue winning, but
winning doesn't happen all the time.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.405
It's few and far between.

08:38.429 --> 08:43.740
It's extremely difficult and takes a mass
of dedication, sacrifice and timing.

08:46.177 --> 08:47.788
Drop it down a little.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.207
Oh, there it is. Yeah.
See? Seven.

09:00.191 --> 09:04.258
I feel the same way I do about him
as I did about Mario and Ayrton.

09:04.282 --> 09:09.046
You always do your job a hundred percent
for the driver you're working for.

09:09.070 --> 09:14.051
But with Scotty, I feel that
little bit of extra motivation,

09:14.075 --> 09:18.316
because he's got that little
bit extra going for him.

09:18.340 --> 09:22.494
And so you want to give everything
and then some, you know?

09:22.518 --> 09:26.498
And it was the same feeling I had
with Mario and with Ayrton, you know?

09:26.522 --> 09:29.133
You knew you were dealing
with a special guy.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.155
I think globally the Indy
500 is a significant event.

09:54.158 --> 09:57.553
Winning it multiple times
defines who you are.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.209
I think it changes
the driver's career.

10:03.994 --> 10:07.389
That one day will change
that driver for ever.

10:26.930 --> 10:31.345
Every time you get into that car, you
don't know if you're gonna come out.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.478
You don't know if you're
gonna come out alive.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.582
You don't know if you're
gonna come out in one piece.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.963
You don't know that, but
you don't think about it.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.748
You think about the job
that you want to do.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.340
You want to be the best,
you want to do your best.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.213
You have to face death.

10:55.872 --> 10:58.590
Two of my closest friends that,

10:58.614 --> 11:02.333
you know, had the most beautiful
men that were plucked,

11:02.357 --> 11:06.293
um, out of the sport, and
sometimes I do go into the race,

11:06.317 --> 11:09.949
I am, like, you know, "Oh, I
don't want it to be my turn."

11:09.973 --> 11:11.235
Hey, good luck today.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.972
Oh, they're racing now.
Into the first corner,

11:32.996 --> 11:35.932
the 35 car, the Mount Wellington
driver, there he goes,

11:35.956 --> 11:38.021
Scott Dixon takes the lead.
Second place...

11:38.045 --> 11:40.414
Every night before a race,

11:40.438 --> 11:44.767
before I go to sleep,
I text him, say,

11:44.791 --> 11:46.967
"Have a good race. Be safe."

11:51.798 --> 11:54.191
He's still my little boy and...

11:55.236 --> 11:57.170
it does, it worries me,

11:57.194 --> 12:00.130
but I am more relaxed.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.634
I think, because...

12:03.810 --> 12:07.703
he's so confident
about his driving,

12:07.727 --> 12:11.010
I don't worry as-as much.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.732
I-I can relax.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.538
What's the long-term aim?
Starting off in Formula B?

12:17.562 --> 12:22.413
Um, go to Ford, then get graded
for my license, hopefully again,

12:22.437 --> 12:25.527
and go to Atlantic, and hopefully
Indy cars or something.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.919
I'm normally pretty
quiet at this time

12:49.943 --> 12:52.206
and just taking in a
lot of information.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.402
That's kind of the most
comfortable part is,

12:55.426 --> 12:57.230
you know, once you get in
the car, you're belted in

12:57.254 --> 12:59.213
and you just start to
get into the zone.

13:06.568 --> 13:09.397
You kind of have that eerie
silence before the engines start.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.773
We try very hard to
live in the moment,

13:17.797 --> 13:21.864
because I am scared that one
day, you know, it's my turn.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.586
And that's what I have
to live with as well.

14:03.494 --> 14:04.931
We're green!

16:02.657 --> 16:04.746
In these speeds, you know,
400 feet per second...

16:06.966 --> 16:09.751
almost a football
field every second...

16:16.062 --> 16:18.431
the cars are inches apart,

16:18.455 --> 16:21.763
so literally, way faster
than you can react.

16:26.420 --> 16:30.661
You're adjusting your steering, making
corrections faster than you can think.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.663
You're not thinking about
turning the wheel,

16:32.687 --> 16:35.081
and if you have to think
about, then it's too late.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.310
Uh, up top right there.
Stop! Stop! Ooh!

16:54.056 --> 16:57.601
I heard the spotter scream
something at Scott,

16:57.625 --> 17:00.106
and then... it went silent.

17:15.643 --> 17:16.992
Is he all right?

17:19.125 --> 17:21.886
You look up at the telemetry
screen, if you're not already,

17:21.910 --> 17:25.107
and you see a lot of things on the
telemetry that are not normal.

17:25.131 --> 17:28.762
Uh, up top right there.
Stop! Stop! Ooh!

17:28.786 --> 17:32.331
The car goes in the air, the RPM
goes up, the steering goes crazy.

17:32.355 --> 17:35.247
But the speed is not
doing what it should.

17:35.271 --> 17:38.033
All those squiggles, they
speak to us as engineers.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.320
We know, ooh, the steering
shouldn't look like that.

17:43.584 --> 17:47.129
It's almost like you're outside
of yourself looking down,

17:47.153 --> 17:50.262
because everything is happening
faster than you want it to.

17:50.286 --> 17:53.898
But it seems slow, 'cause it all
just slows down in your mind.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.861
At those speeds...

18:00.862 --> 18:02.168
you know that...

18:03.517 --> 18:05.625
it's not gonna end well.

18:05.649 --> 18:08.715
But those-those moments,
agonizingly long.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.153
What a huge crash.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.893
Agonizingly long.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.310
Scott Dixon is in it.

18:29.456 --> 18:33.131
Jay Howard is the
other car involved.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.916
Dixon and Jay Howard.
There is Dixon.

18:35.940 --> 18:39.746
Look at that car.
It is destroyed.

18:39.770 --> 18:42.817
There's nothing left of the back.
That sawed the engine in half.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.788
Well, I think it affects
the entire team.

19:01.575 --> 19:06.338
Because this is a people business.
We are people.

19:06.362 --> 19:09.254
We love each other. We
support each other.

19:09.278 --> 19:13.476
We eat, sleep, and
travel together.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.764
You lose family
members in this deal.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.440
Huh? I honestly thought
that was my turn.

19:21.464 --> 19:22.920
Yeah?

19:22.944 --> 19:24.728
After Susie.

19:31.300 --> 19:35.628
Hi, everybody.

19:35.652 --> 19:38.065
Saw he was gonna hit the wall, but I
thought it'd be a little bit later.

19:38.089 --> 19:39.980
That's why I chose left.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.722
Um, tried to slow the car down as much
as possible, but just wasn't to be.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.898
And Scott Dixon already
thinking about next year.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.510
Yeah. Yeah.Yep. Yep.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.599
Glad to see you
walking out of there.

19:49.623 --> 19:52.341
Wrong place, wrong time.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.995
Is that... Were you just hanging on for
the ride at the point? Yeah, it's just...

19:55.019 --> 19:57.152
Yeah, that car saved
our life today.

20:00.590 --> 20:01.983
Didn't it?

20:04.072 --> 20:06.355
He had a good car
as well, like...

20:06.379 --> 20:07.965
I'm just thank our lucky stars.

20:07.989 --> 20:11.011
But I'm kind of like...
Now I'm like, "Oh man."

20:11.035 --> 20:12.211
But...

20:13.429 --> 20:14.972
Yeah.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.669
At least he's good.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.454
Daddy's here.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.325
Yeah.

20:20.349 --> 20:23.067
Hi, monkey. How are you?
Good? Good.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.329
What are you guys doing?

20:24.353 --> 20:26.244
We've always been a
pretty open family

20:26.268 --> 20:28.420
in the fact that I do
something that's dangerous.

20:28.444 --> 20:31.336
So, Mr. Scotty, I know that there's
something wrong with that.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.034
You should go get a boot.
Ah, we'll see.

20:34.058 --> 20:37.061
I've never reflected on, you know,
maybe I should give this up.

20:38.498 --> 20:40.476
I love, you know, the
people I get to work with,

20:40.500 --> 20:42.023
and my passion is racing.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.665
When he was a real baby,

20:55.689 --> 20:58.755
if he wanted to say good night to
me, he had to come downstairs,

20:58.779 --> 21:03.194
because we were working on the race car
for the next Saturday night race meeting.

21:03.218 --> 21:05.022
He'd want to touch every
tool that was there,

21:05.046 --> 21:08.092
and if it had grease and dirt on
it, that was him... He loved it.

21:11.879 --> 21:15.274
The first time I ever got in
a go-kart was... was crazy.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.603
In a go-cart, you sit
really low, you know,

21:20.627 --> 21:22.716
so everything seems like
it's going very fast.

21:25.240 --> 21:29.002
There's the sense of speed and
having control of something.

21:29.026 --> 21:31.246
I'm sure I was going
very slow at the time.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.967
We used to go away
a lot together.

21:36.991 --> 21:39.839
If it wasn't at Mount Wellington,
it was at the Auckland track,

21:39.863 --> 21:43.867
or Hamilton, Tokoroa
or, uh, Hastings.

21:45.391 --> 21:49.458
We would go with other
families and sleep in tents.

21:49.482 --> 21:53.766
And the, uh... the families that had
plenty of money, they'd be in the motel.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.900
Well, we'd make sure we got invited to
the barbecue that night at their place,

21:56.924 --> 22:00.406
or if you wanted to shower,
somebody would always offer.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.475
It's a huge, huge family.

22:06.499 --> 22:08.544
It's a competitive family.

22:20.426 --> 22:24.362
Even from go-kart days, if you had
a big crash or a flip or a wreck,

22:24.386 --> 22:28.018
you know, that same day was probably the
best time to get back into the car,

22:28.042 --> 22:29.715
just so, you know,

22:29.739 --> 22:33.371
sometimes it can be, um, you
know, tough for people.

22:33.395 --> 22:37.506
But it's-it's... that's the best thing
you can do is get back on it, but...

22:37.530 --> 22:41.510
I can't get ready on time. I just
physically cannot get ready on time, can I?

22:41.534 --> 22:43.555
You look amazing, babe.
Thank you.

22:43.579 --> 22:45.601
So do you.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.430
I can't believe you managed to
get that foot in that shoe.

22:48.454 --> 22:49.803
Bit swollen.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.871
See, so I would have milked
it and, like, dragged my leg.

22:54.982 --> 22:57.177
Pretend.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.638
Okay. I think we're ready.

23:08.430 --> 23:11.061
You had a feeling, huh? I had a
feeling about him, didn't I?

23:11.085 --> 23:14.456
Should have told me that in the morning.
I did tell you.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.284
I should have spun out and crashed
when the car was loose earlier on.

23:17.308 --> 23:19.286
I don't know how you didn't, man.
That was wild.

23:19.310 --> 23:20.897
Did you see it go...
You were so trim.

23:20.921 --> 23:23.202
I had huge runs on you, like,
still couldn't make it past.

23:26.535 --> 23:29.190
The toughest part is just
trying to get ready so quickly.

23:32.323 --> 23:35.651
And I guess in this situation, it'd
be nice if there's a week off.

23:35.675 --> 23:37.392
And Detroit is probably...

23:37.416 --> 23:39.936
It's the roughest, and it's the
only doubleheader of the season.

24:40.391 --> 24:44.067
The jump from Indy to Detroit
is notoriously difficult.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.722
You're going from the most
important race of the year,

24:46.746 --> 24:50.290
and three or four days later
you're on the track in Detroit.

24:50.314 --> 24:54.275
But when you have something massive
happen at the 500, like we had...

24:55.581 --> 24:58.497
completely destroyed
a car at the 500...

25:00.107 --> 25:02.651
The debris was spread
across our three garages.

25:02.675 --> 25:04.827
There was... I mean,
there was just

25:04.839 --> 25:07.003
unrecognizable parts of
the car everywhere...

25:07.027 --> 25:11.877
And it compounds the stress and the anxiety
and the issues you're thinking about.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.012
And they're all 365.

25:16.036 --> 25:18.275
How much?

25:18.299 --> 25:21.104
When you're in the building and you're
doing your prep work, it's a routine.

25:21.128 --> 25:23.585
You know what to do. It's the same
thing for every race, pretty much.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.239
And then whenever a crash happens,
you still know what to do.

25:26.263 --> 25:28.590
You know what parts to change,
what needs to be checked,

25:28.614 --> 25:31.593
you know how to fix the car, how
to do this, how to do that.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.508
You just have to do it
at an accelerated rate.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.684
Just get the temperature,
Tim, please.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.493
Oh shoot. I got to go pour this out.
Come on, Dave.

25:40.626 --> 25:43.126
After the crash, we built
a new car from scratch.

25:43.150 --> 25:46.477
So we had a couple of
late nights at the shop.

25:46.501 --> 25:50.612
And, uh, everything seemed
to go back together well.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.657
I think Scott's doing fine.

25:52.681 --> 25:57.053
I'm sure he's a little bit sore, but
I think we'll be doing all right.

25:57.077 --> 26:00.709
I mean, right now we're second in the
points. So, you know, this is important.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.691
So we're just trying
to keep the pace up.

26:09.611 --> 26:13.722
If I know that I can be physically
fitter than the competition,

26:13.746 --> 26:16.028
you know, it's one less thing
I have to worry about.

26:16.052 --> 26:17.706
Five seconds.

26:20.361 --> 26:24.210
This day and age, it becomes a lot more
than just running or cycling or swimming

26:24.234 --> 26:26.256
or going and lifting weights.

26:26.280 --> 26:30.434
You know, it's become more about reaction
times to, you know, plyometrics to...

26:30.458 --> 26:32.175
Five seconds.

26:32.199 --> 26:35.700
Any kind of advantage that you can
find for what you do in a car,

26:35.724 --> 26:37.833
you know, helps...
fly, reverse fly.

26:37.857 --> 26:41.140
These cars have, you know, over
6,000 pounds of downforce.

26:41.164 --> 26:44.274
You're getting five to six
G's in some of the corners.

26:44.298 --> 26:46.624
Your neck is one of the
hardest things to train,

26:46.648 --> 26:49.453
with the G loading up the helmet, you
know, it's always pulling on you.

26:49.477 --> 26:52.412
Push, pull. Push, pull.
Push, pull. Last 15.

26:52.436 --> 26:56.765
And then the cardio side of it where
you're well over 150, 160 beats per minute

26:56.789 --> 26:59.419
for that
three-and-a-half-hour race.

26:59.443 --> 27:01.770
Come on. Come on. Five to go.

27:04.971 --> 27:06.407
Correct.

27:07.887 --> 27:09.952
We obviously can't put
them in the race car.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.780
We don't have that
capacity in here.

27:11.804 --> 27:14.696
But you can still train
the neural pathways

27:14.720 --> 27:18.613
to process things
easier and faster,

27:18.637 --> 27:21.093
and identify things, and, um...

27:21.117 --> 27:24.270
so we train the mind and the brain
to do these kind of things,

27:24.294 --> 27:26.621
and then when it comes
to the race car,

27:26.645 --> 27:30.300
they'd hopefully just shift gears over
to the race car... same neural pathways.

27:31.954 --> 27:35.107
Eight seconds.

27:35.131 --> 27:38.981
He'll be in there carrying on a
conversation and speaking nice and soft

27:39.005 --> 27:42.158
and just doing it very methodically,
but he's not wasting energy.

27:42.182 --> 27:46.466
Whereas other drivers are just pounding
away and moving their feet and everything.

27:46.490 --> 27:50.166
He's very efficient in there. I think
that's probably the way he drives.

27:50.190 --> 27:52.124
Good.

27:52.148 --> 27:54.910
Everything correct.
Good job. 126.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.370
Just do another on that heat.

28:01.549 --> 28:05.572
We'll load the wheel up super heavy
sometimes. Sometimes a little lighter.

28:05.596 --> 28:08.619
It's the same motion as
they use in the race car.

28:08.643 --> 28:10.752
You're training the
exact same muscles.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.711
And you're doing it with the
reaction, so it makes them,

28:13.735 --> 28:15.302
um, able to respond
quicker in the car.

28:19.654 --> 28:21.719
When the accident happened,

28:21.743 --> 28:25.767
from where Scott realized that
he had to decide right then

28:25.791 --> 28:28.204
whether he was gonna try to
go to the left or the right,

28:28.228 --> 28:31.686
and you have basically process
what a cruise missile does.

28:31.710 --> 28:36.560
I need to get from here to there
and avoid this in milliseconds.

28:36.584 --> 28:40.869
Even with the best human reactions, it
still takes a couple of tenths of a second

28:40.893 --> 28:44.002
to actually start pushing the
pedal to slow the car down.

28:44.026 --> 28:46.701
And sometimes you have to
decide which way you're going

28:46.725 --> 28:48.833
before you really know
what's happening,

28:48.857 --> 28:51.575
before you really know what the trajectory
of that car in front of you is,

28:51.599 --> 28:55.144
whether it's gonna go left or
right or flip over or what.

28:55.168 --> 28:58.147
You watch it on TV, and
it's always in slow motion,

28:58.171 --> 29:00.366
it seems like, "Why didn't he do this?
Why didn't he do that?"

29:00.390 --> 29:02.830
He did it before you even realized
the accident was happening.

29:03.872 --> 29:05.676
It just happens so fast.

29:05.700 --> 29:06.701
Stop! Stop! Ooh!

29:23.413 --> 29:24.413
Okay...

29:25.372 --> 29:26.852
welcome to Detroit.

29:28.418 --> 29:33.617
Um... just a follow-up
on last week, um...

29:33.641 --> 29:37.621
we obviously didn't win the Indy 500, and
that's what we open up every meeting with.

29:37.645 --> 29:41.059
So what's our choice left now?

29:41.083 --> 29:44.280
Win the championship. Win the
championship, right? Okay.

29:44.304 --> 29:47.500
Obviously, the 10 car, we
had a little brake issue.

29:47.524 --> 29:51.678
And obviously with, uh, Evel
Knievel down there, uh...

29:53.443 --> 29:55.813
As if the week didn't have
enough activity already,

29:55.837 --> 29:58.033
you had to give
us more that day.

29:58.057 --> 30:01.800
Anyway, we're poised for the rest
of the season. So let's go get it.

30:17.119 --> 30:21.273
With me, what accidents linger
longer and set doubt into your mind

30:21.297 --> 30:23.058
are ones that you've caused

30:23.082 --> 30:26.128
as far as losing control of the
car, spinning out by yourself.

30:32.787 --> 30:36.288
That's when I felt most
vulnerable on a confidence level,

30:36.312 --> 30:41.143
and confidence in my ability, to where
it starts to affect how fast you go.

30:45.017 --> 30:47.734
But with Indianapolis and the crash,
it was just wrong place, wrong time.

30:47.758 --> 30:49.519
I couldn't have done
anything different.

30:49.543 --> 30:52.763
Jay couldn't have done anything different.
Nobody did it on purpose.

31:04.514 --> 31:06.753
So we'll see what happens today.

31:06.777 --> 31:09.800
Uh, so it could be three
stops today, Dave?

31:09.824 --> 31:12.063
Eighteen seconds. Eighteen
seconds in your time.

31:12.087 --> 31:16.154
So just remember what today is all about.
Today is about today.

31:16.178 --> 31:20.487
Racing validates what we do today.
So... do what you do best.

31:27.668 --> 31:32.518
With Indianapolis and the crash, it
didn't reflect in my mind at all

31:32.542 --> 31:34.893
something that would hinder
my performance down the road.

31:36.024 --> 31:38.742
It was just about...

31:38.766 --> 31:41.300
how do I get my body
back to something I can

31:41.312 --> 31:43.858
use, you know, racing
with a broken ankle.

31:49.559 --> 31:52.712
You could tell he wasn't too
phased after the accident.

31:52.736 --> 31:55.977
But to be honest, it was a big
question mark for all of us, I think.

31:56.001 --> 32:00.503
Race fans, it's time for those
most famous words in motorsports.

32:00.527 --> 32:02.984
- All right, fans,
are you ready?-

32:03.008 --> 32:06.161
Drivers, start your engines!

33:00.239 --> 33:03.435
The crash really brings
the risks to light.

33:03.459 --> 33:07.178
If, as a driver, you're a
fraction of a percent cautious,

33:07.202 --> 33:09.659
then you're not as quick, and
your further back in the field,

33:09.683 --> 33:11.293
well, then it just
snowballs from there.

33:32.488 --> 33:34.510
Rahal in front of Dixon.

33:34.534 --> 33:36.294
And talking about Scott Dixon,

33:36.318 --> 33:37.992
what an incredible
comeback this week.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.602
On crutches most of the week.

33:39.626 --> 33:42.953
An injury to the inside of his
left ankle, in the tibia,

33:42.977 --> 33:44.650
a large weight-bearing
bone in the lower leg.

33:44.674 --> 33:47.088
He said, "I can push
the brake pedal."

33:47.112 --> 33:48.872
It's pulling my foot off
the brake pedal that's

33:48.884 --> 33:50.656
a problem, with the
swelling and numbness."

33:50.680 --> 33:52.117
But Dixon hanging on.

34:50.349 --> 34:53.091
Rahal now 8.6 seconds
in front of Dixon.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.728
It's amazing how Scotty didn't want
people talking about his injury.

35:02.752 --> 35:04.948
He admitted that this is gonna
be a very difficult day.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.972
He said, "My biggest concern
is gonna be fatigue."

35:11.979 --> 35:14.436
The car itself isn't a
fun thing to drive.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.873
It's an extremely sensitive car.

35:16.897 --> 35:19.813
You could roll over a pebble, and
you can feel that in the chassis.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.402
And it vibrates like
mad, just vibrating,

35:24.426 --> 35:26.361
and you can't really breathe.

35:26.385 --> 35:29.265
And you can't see what's in the mirrors
because they're vibrating so bad.

35:31.955 --> 35:33.324
Scott running second.

35:33.348 --> 35:35.916
He's got about five seconds
on Hinchcliffe in third.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.054
You're holding your breath in the
corners to fight the G forces.

35:47.319 --> 35:52.604
He's got to put 300 pounds of pressure
with one foot on the brake pedal.

35:52.628 --> 35:54.519
But you're right. He
has not complained.

35:54.543 --> 35:57.242
He has not said a single word.

35:59.244 --> 36:01.396
What blows my mind is Scott
has still got to put up

36:01.420 --> 36:03.354
with all of the physical
feeling of the car

36:03.378 --> 36:06.488
around Detroit or Toronto,
any of the street courses...

36:06.512 --> 36:11.710
Graham Rahal has a 6.6 second
lead over Scott Dixon.

36:11.734 --> 36:15.845
And put in lap times that are within
hundredths of a second of each other

36:15.869 --> 36:18.848
again and again and again and again...
perfect.

36:18.872 --> 36:21.024
Perfect. The entries
are perfect, the exits

36:21.036 --> 36:23.200
are perfect, the mid-corner
speed is perfect.

36:26.488 --> 36:29.143
Those skills combined
just blow my mind.

36:34.627 --> 36:37.891
Career win number five to
Graham Rahal at Detroit.

36:40.023 --> 36:41.982
Great drive for Scott
Dixon in second.

36:58.477 --> 37:01.934
Some days the reality
exceeds expectation,

37:01.958 --> 37:03.398
and some days you
accept the reality.

37:04.961 --> 37:06.983
Well, if you can't win
today, be second.

37:07.007 --> 37:08.704
If you can't be
second, be third.

37:10.184 --> 37:12.597
And with that attitude,
you never give up.

37:12.621 --> 37:14.144
You never stop trying.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.429
That was hard work.

37:18.453 --> 37:19.889
Good job, bro. Hey,
just missed it.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.178
Well done, Scott.
Hey, thanks, man.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.224
Sorry, I got a little angry there, but...
That's all right.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.922
We get through it. Not
the end of the world.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.034
Thanks, man.

37:59.059 --> 38:01.820
I think for me that's been a
huge help is Poppy and Tilly.

38:01.844 --> 38:03.169
Ready to jump? No.

38:03.193 --> 38:04.693
Why not? Watch this.

38:04.717 --> 38:08.131
Mommy says I can't swim in
the deep end, but watch.

38:08.155 --> 38:10.873
You have a race weekend, and you
walk through the door Sunday night,

38:10.897 --> 38:13.658
and you can talk about the
picture they drew today

38:13.682 --> 38:15.486
and what they've been
doing at school.

38:15.510 --> 38:18.600
So I don't know, I've really
enjoyed that about being a father.

38:20.559 --> 38:24.408
Poppy, I think, is starting to
understand a little bit more.

38:24.432 --> 38:27.455
Tilly was a little set back, I
think, after the Indianapolis crash,

38:27.479 --> 38:29.979
because she saw it a few times.

38:30.003 --> 38:31.850
She was, like, "Oh,
did that hurt?"

38:31.874 --> 38:34.636
Or, you know, "Could you have
been injured a lot more?"

38:36.488 --> 38:38.074
There you go. Can you throw me?

38:38.098 --> 38:39.858
You've got... You've
still got more.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.449
No, Mommy is actually full up.

38:43.103 --> 38:48.345
Emma is... is a big
portion of who I am now,

38:48.369 --> 38:51.392
how I approach races,
how competitive I am.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.916
I was waiting... I was
waiting for seconds.

38:53.940 --> 38:57.963
For me, I think, with her background as a
runner, and a runner for Great Britain,

38:57.987 --> 39:00.052
you know, the training
side, the focus,

39:00.076 --> 39:04.318
and mentally with her having gone through
something like that to an Olympic level,

39:04.342 --> 39:06.320
it complements what
I'm trying to do.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.973
I know, I said, cakes.

39:07.997 --> 39:12.132
She loves the sport, but
she only wants me to win.

39:13.699 --> 39:16.025
Okay, put this down. Okay,
let me get the cookies.

39:16.049 --> 39:18.244
Cookie batter.

39:18.268 --> 39:23.337
I was thinking about it. Maybe, you know,
I do push Scott so hard or, you know,

39:23.361 --> 39:25.643
I focus so much on
the race season,

39:25.667 --> 39:29.038
as in, like, diet and sleep
and all that good stuff.

39:29.062 --> 39:34.391
Maybe it's... You know, I never did
fulfill all my dreams, you know,

39:34.415 --> 39:35.958
as a runner.

39:35.982 --> 39:39.638
And I got a second chance with
Scott to help him fulfill his.

39:45.295 --> 39:48.623
In sport, we're always
looking for that little sign

39:48.647 --> 39:51.998
of how to make ourselves bigger
and better than the next person.

39:53.826 --> 39:56.674
In running, you're feeling the
pace of the people around you,

39:56.698 --> 39:58.807
and how heavily
they're breathing.

39:58.831 --> 40:00.930
When is the right time
to put that charge in

40:00.942 --> 40:03.052
and, you know, when
people are suffering?

40:13.236 --> 40:15.606
I see Scott, he'll come
round the top bend,

40:15.630 --> 40:19.044
and I already see he's lining
himself up for the move.

40:19.068 --> 40:21.917
I can already see the
one he's going for.

40:21.941 --> 40:24.857
And it might take three laps, but
I know he's going for this one.

40:31.603 --> 40:33.842
It's so loud, and it's
such a quick lap,

40:33.866 --> 40:36.018
because we're on,
like, a short oval.

40:36.042 --> 40:37.889
It comes round super quickly.

40:37.913 --> 40:39.437
So they're back again.

40:43.745 --> 40:46.420
The competitive side of
me, the athlete is, like,

40:46.444 --> 40:50.360
"Come on. Come on. Give it everything.
Come on. You know, stay focused."

40:53.146 --> 40:55.714
But then it's two sides
of the race for me.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.346
And the other is, like,
"Please, God, I don't care.

41:00.370 --> 41:03.437
It's not about the win, I just...
I just need him home."

41:08.640 --> 41:10.705
I better go.

41:10.729 --> 41:12.620
Love you, Daddy. See you after
the race, right? Love you.

41:12.644 --> 41:13.882
Good luck, Daddy.
Good luck, baby.

41:13.906 --> 41:16.058
Love you.Mm. Good luck.

41:16.082 --> 41:17.625
Good luck. Thanks, baby.

41:17.649 --> 41:18.954
Good luck.

41:24.743 --> 41:28.984
So we're at a very dangerous point
in the championship right now.

41:29.008 --> 41:31.900
We're eight points
out of the lead,

41:31.924 --> 41:36.513
and we are surrounded by some
extremely talented guys,

41:36.537 --> 41:38.626
and our biggest team
threat is Penske.

41:42.108 --> 41:46.523
Anybody in motorsports is an
underdog to the Penske organization.

41:46.547 --> 41:48.984
They have been the
benchmark for many years.

41:52.118 --> 41:55.227
It's gonna be a really
steep uphill climb,

41:55.251 --> 41:58.472
to try and overcome one of
the best teams in history.

41:59.952 --> 42:02.302
Well, let's talk
about Hélio first.

42:03.912 --> 42:05.847
Really fast.

42:05.871 --> 42:10.634
Probably one of the toughest guys to
fight, because he's unpredictable.

42:10.658 --> 42:13.332
Then you get Simon Pagenaud.

42:13.356 --> 42:19.251
Very meticulous, calm, calculates
everything he is gonna do, every move.

42:19.275 --> 42:22.322
He's really smart, so you've got to
be careful, because he's just there.

42:25.586 --> 42:27.738
And then you have Will Power.
How can you not

42:27.750 --> 42:29.914
be race car driver
with a name like that?

42:29.938 --> 42:32.027
I don't think anybody can
beat him in one lap.

42:35.770 --> 42:40.142
Josef Newgarden, the American kid.
The American dream.

42:40.166 --> 42:43.362
The series is talking about, "We have
all these foreigners, you know",

42:43.386 --> 42:46.235
Brazilians, New Zealanders,
Australians, French,

42:46.259 --> 42:50.326
but where is the
American?" And he's cool.

42:50.350 --> 42:51.849
You've got two fire-breathers.

42:51.873 --> 42:54.896
You have one that has all the
experience, in Scott Dixon,

42:54.920 --> 42:56.867
and you've got another
one in Josef Newgarden

42:56.879 --> 42:58.837
that's just getting ready
to load up and go.

43:08.977 --> 43:11.086
Ready to roll for Road America.

43:11.110 --> 43:14.219
It's Penske on
Penske at the start!

43:14.243 --> 43:16.526
Race strategy is a little
easier with Scott,

43:16.550 --> 43:19.529
because he is the man when it comes
to fuel economy and savings,

43:19.553 --> 43:22.010
and it's something two
or three other drivers

43:22.022 --> 43:24.490
in this series may
do, that I know of.

43:24.514 --> 43:26.212
And most of them
are on Penske's.

43:30.259 --> 43:35.700
We had to be very calculating for every
lap in order to get the most out of it.

43:37.049 --> 43:39.027
And Scott had to do his job.

43:39.051 --> 43:43.074
We had to leapfrog four
cars to get to the front,

43:43.098 --> 43:45.686
at-at a very high speed circuit.

43:45.710 --> 43:48.427
And the pass that he made on
Josef Newgarden at the end,

43:48.451 --> 43:52.127
showed you how much he
wanted to win the race.

43:52.151 --> 43:54.303
A good run for Scott Dixon.

43:54.327 --> 43:57.872
The blue cars pops to the outside trying to
go around the outside of Josef Newgarden.

43:57.896 --> 44:00.701
Side-by-side coming in
to turn number one.

44:00.725 --> 44:05.270
Newgarden won't give it up, but Dixon is
gonna grab the spot and takes the lead.

44:05.294 --> 44:08.491
Driving around the outside of
somebody in turn one at Road America,

44:08.515 --> 44:10.972
that is like a carnival ride.

44:10.996 --> 44:13.235
There's nothing good
gonna come out of that,

44:13.259 --> 44:15.672
but something good
came out of it for us.

44:15.696 --> 44:17.369
Road America was
pretty incredible.

44:20.832 --> 44:24.159
You saw it coming, because he was so
far ahead, and Josef was right on him.

44:24.183 --> 44:26.640
But you're like, "Okay. Well,
this is gonna happen."

44:26.664 --> 44:30.165
Scott Dixon, the master is going
to take the checkered flag,

44:30.189 --> 44:32.167
win for the first
time in Road America,

44:32.191 --> 44:34.604
and the first time in 2017.

44:34.628 --> 44:36.084
Okay. This is good.

44:47.467 --> 44:50.775
It's hard not to get emotional about
it, because you put so much into it.

44:53.647 --> 44:56.060
I feel like there's a lot
of weight on your shoulders

44:56.084 --> 44:57.758
at the start of a race,

44:57.782 --> 44:59.653
which makes winning
feel so damn good.

45:01.481 --> 45:02.893
Scott Dixon.

45:06.094 --> 45:08.401
All right! Whoo!

45:10.533 --> 45:14.992
He won the Formula B National
Championship at the age of 13.

45:15.016 --> 45:18.803
He's the youngest driver ever to hold
an international racing license.

45:21.457 --> 45:25.786
Scott was always so determined

45:25.810 --> 45:27.637
that that's what
he wanted to do.

45:29.683 --> 45:32.227
We had been in the media a lot,

45:32.251 --> 45:36.666
so people knew that we
had really struggled

45:36.690 --> 45:38.624
to get Scott to where he got.

45:38.648 --> 45:43.151
And people would always
say, "Your son owes you."

45:43.175 --> 45:45.438
He does not owe me anything.

45:51.836 --> 45:55.119
We protected him from the
financial problems that we had,

45:55.143 --> 45:57.121
and we had a lot.

45:57.145 --> 46:00.516
You know, I used to work, I don't know,
40, 50 hours a week on my business,

46:00.540 --> 46:02.847
and 40 to 50 hours
a week on Scott.

46:10.550 --> 46:13.921
And we tried to be as honest
as we could with Scott,

46:13.945 --> 46:16.488
but we would keep him away
from the slammed doors,

46:16.512 --> 46:17.838
the...

46:17.862 --> 46:20.101
"Not interested. Go away,"

46:20.125 --> 46:22.040
or "No, motorsport
isn't our thing."

46:23.781 --> 46:26.107
We borrowed money.
I borrowed money.

46:26.131 --> 46:29.588
I borrowed money that even
Glen didn't know about.

46:29.612 --> 46:32.156
It's like having a
drug addiction.

46:32.180 --> 46:34.226
You can't stop.

46:36.837 --> 46:39.990
No matter what differences we
have, and anything in life,

46:40.014 --> 46:43.515
but the pride of what he's done,
and what he's achieved...

46:43.539 --> 46:48.172
And it doesn't matter who has been
behind him or helped him or whatever,

46:48.196 --> 46:51.915
he's actually the one that's
achieved the accolades,

46:51.939 --> 46:53.569
and how well he's
done, you know.

46:53.593 --> 46:54.875
Yeah.

46:54.899 --> 46:56.224
I love him to bits.

46:56.248 --> 46:57.791
I really do.

47:14.309 --> 47:17.332
I remember watching him walk
around the paddock in Nazareth

47:17.356 --> 47:19.290
when he was an Indy
Lights driver,

47:19.314 --> 47:22.250
coming over to drive Indy cars.

47:22.274 --> 47:25.470
I remember he was the
young-looking guy,

47:25.494 --> 47:28.473
and I thought, "Boy, does this kid
know what he's getting into?"

47:28.497 --> 47:29.866
You know?

47:29.890 --> 47:31.770
And of course he won the
race there in Nazareth.

47:33.676 --> 47:35.916
He was very shy,

47:35.940 --> 47:39.093
and, uh... and he was very shy
for the first year or two,

47:39.117 --> 47:41.815
and it took a lot to coax him
to come out of his shell a bit.

47:46.167 --> 47:49.799
I want Scott to be
Scott, and-and-and...

47:49.823 --> 47:52.149
I'm okay with whatever that is.

47:52.173 --> 47:55.674
As long as when it's time to go
fast, he can get the job done.

47:55.698 --> 47:57.938
And he knows he can do that.

47:57.962 --> 47:59.572
We know he can do that.

48:13.978 --> 48:16.739
There's a lot of different points
through the weekend where...

48:16.763 --> 48:19.263
Where a split second can
make all the difference.

48:19.287 --> 48:22.005
You've always got to be mentally
calculating in your head,

48:22.029 --> 48:23.702
"What's the upside
if we pit now?

48:23.726 --> 48:25.511
What's the downside
if we pit now?"

48:27.078 --> 48:29.534
It's a bit like counting
cards in Blackjack.

48:29.558 --> 48:31.493
You just try to get the
odds in your favor,

48:31.517 --> 48:33.408
and then you make your bet.

48:33.432 --> 48:35.105
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

48:35.129 --> 48:37.349
The goal is to win a lot
more than you lose.

48:41.353 --> 48:44.549
You have to scrape together
every single point possible.

48:44.573 --> 48:49.728
And all we can do that's do
the best job that we can

48:49.752 --> 48:51.624
over stuff that's
in our control.

48:53.582 --> 48:55.758
For the rest of the season,
we need to be perfect.

49:01.503 --> 49:03.742
He's got to not think about me,

49:03.766 --> 49:05.396
he's got to put the
children away,

49:05.420 --> 49:07.877
he's got to, you know,
put his helmet on,

49:07.901 --> 49:10.880
and trust the people that
he's racing against.

49:10.904 --> 49:13.535
He knows what he can
do on the racetrack.

49:13.559 --> 49:15.537
He trusts himself,

49:15.561 --> 49:20.063
but he's also got to put that trust
in the other 33 guys around him.

49:20.087 --> 49:22.394
That's what I would
really struggle with.

49:31.055 --> 49:35.209
It's only one winner at the end of the day.
It's either gonna be you or me.

49:35.233 --> 49:38.038
How can you trust somebody

49:38.062 --> 49:40.736
that is going after the
same dream as you?

49:40.760 --> 49:42.240
And at the same time...

49:43.371 --> 49:44.982
at the same place?

49:47.071 --> 49:49.769
You got to choose who you can
trust, and who you cannot trust.

49:59.953 --> 50:02.410
You work really, really hard for
this perpetual motion machine,

50:02.434 --> 50:04.542
that's based on time.

50:04.566 --> 50:06.762
You know, racing is
about a timetable.

50:06.786 --> 50:08.807
We're at six seconds
in the pit lane,

50:08.831 --> 50:11.549
and you lose two or three tenths
of a second over your neighbor,

50:11.573 --> 50:13.073
that bumps you back four spots.

50:13.097 --> 50:14.422
Think about that.

50:14.446 --> 50:15.945
Three to four tenths of a second

50:15.969 --> 50:20.036
moves you four spots toward the
rear on a normal pit stop.

50:22.541 --> 50:24.736
He's in! He's in! He's in!

50:26.632 --> 50:29.678
The first stop, we came
in, tires came off.

50:30.853 --> 50:32.701
Tires went back on.

50:32.725 --> 50:35.138
So Pat dropped the car,
I went to send the car,

50:35.162 --> 50:38.881
Kyle has still got his wheel gun on the...
on the right rear wheel.

50:38.905 --> 50:40.839
Scott Dixon, not
as fast of a stop

50:40.863 --> 50:43.016
as you would expect
for the Ganassi team.

50:43.040 --> 50:46.260
Simon goes by, Hunter-Reay
goes by, Rossi goes by.

51:01.319 --> 51:03.993
You know, you're coming into the
pits, you have in your mind,

51:04.017 --> 51:06.300
like, "Yeah, this is... This
is a really good strategy."

51:06.324 --> 51:08.737
The guys are really fast, you're
gonna gain a second here.

51:08.761 --> 51:11.740
"We're gonna, you know, leapfrog, you
know, the three guys we were behind."

51:17.552 --> 51:19.791
Scott Dixon, he
leads the points,

51:19.815 --> 51:21.837
but has had a very, very
difficult day today.

51:21.861 --> 51:24.298
Oh, and now there's a
problem on the left rear.

51:26.126 --> 51:27.625
Oh, my God!

51:46.059 --> 51:48.907
Man, Ganassi is struggling.

51:48.931 --> 51:52.761
They're ninth, 13th,
15th, and 17th.

51:58.419 --> 51:59.962
Josef Newgarden,

51:59.986 --> 52:02.617
he will take the championship
lead for the first time.

52:02.641 --> 52:05.600
Josef Newgarden
dominates in Mid-Ohio.

52:09.735 --> 52:11.974
We're sitting in 11th, like,

52:11.998 --> 52:15.741
an okay salvageable day
would be sixth to finish.

52:18.657 --> 52:20.809
You put everything
you have into this.

52:20.833 --> 52:24.769
You try to look at every avenue
of how things are gonna work out,

52:24.793 --> 52:26.728
and then suddenly it doesn't.

52:26.752 --> 52:28.382
And it's something that's
out of your control,

52:28.406 --> 52:30.166
and you feel
completely helpless.

52:30.190 --> 52:32.777
And you walk away from the race
just completely depressed or...

52:32.801 --> 52:37.110
Or just questioning why you're
doing this in the first place.

52:41.462 --> 52:42.961
Race is done.

52:42.985 --> 52:44.659
You want to crawl under...
A under a rock.

52:44.683 --> 52:46.523
You know, the whole team
trusts you to perform.

52:47.816 --> 52:49.359
And when you get it
wrong, it's just,

52:49.383 --> 52:51.168
you know, the weight of
the world is on you.

52:53.344 --> 52:56.236
Yeah, whether it's putting
Scott at risk on the track,

52:56.260 --> 52:57.846
something being
wrong with the car,

52:57.870 --> 53:00.675
or you've just thrown away your
chances of a win, it can be...

53:00.699 --> 53:03.504
Or a championship at that point.

53:03.528 --> 53:05.680
Like, if that was the last
stop of the last race,

53:05.704 --> 53:08.030
and you were going for the championship,
and you had that problem,

53:08.054 --> 53:10.424
then it's... you're the problem.

53:10.448 --> 53:12.600
You're the reason why you
lost the championship, right?

53:12.624 --> 53:14.210
That's what people focus on.

53:14.234 --> 53:16.430
Couldn't really tell what
he was doing in the middle.

53:16.454 --> 53:19.520
That's because it was
turning the opposite way.

53:19.544 --> 53:21.154
Fuck, it was horrendous.

53:25.506 --> 53:28.572
We've had a couple of races
that didn't go our way.

53:28.596 --> 53:30.357
I think where we're sitting is

53:30.381 --> 53:34.099
probably better than a lot of people
expected... ourselves included...

53:34.123 --> 53:37.562
Um, going up against
the Penske juggernaut.

53:39.912 --> 53:43.892
Leading up to Mid-Ohio we were
three points in the lead.

53:43.916 --> 53:47.243
But the guys in front
of us, Josef and Hélio,

53:47.267 --> 53:49.593
finished higher than
us in Mid-Ohio,

53:49.617 --> 53:51.378
so that puts them
ahead in the points.

53:51.402 --> 53:53.249
That just gave them
enough of a lead

53:53.273 --> 53:54.424
to now we're eight points back.

53:54.448 --> 53:56.078
On the bench up there.

53:56.102 --> 53:57.471
So, oh, the antenna
that came out.Yeah.

53:57.495 --> 53:58.800
All right. Thanks. Cool.

54:02.587 --> 54:06.219
I don't get the happy Scott
without the winning on the track.

54:06.243 --> 54:10.072
And he gets the happy Emma, if
he's the happy Scott, you know?

54:11.944 --> 54:15.339
We know that the drivers are gonna
push it to the absolute limit.

54:17.558 --> 54:19.517
And, you know, the
risks are large.

54:22.520 --> 54:25.629
He's won the Indy 500, and he's made
some money, he's got a beautiful family,

54:25.653 --> 54:27.813
and it makes you wonder what
keeps his drive that high.

54:33.531 --> 54:36.466
So, I mean, it's part of the deal.
We're all at risk.

54:36.490 --> 54:39.339
You know, the boys
in the pit lane.

54:39.363 --> 54:41.863
You know, when we're out there.

54:41.887 --> 54:45.258
I mean, I've known a number of drivers,
of course, who have lost their lives.

54:45.282 --> 54:47.371
But... 25...

54:49.068 --> 54:50.417
Fucking hell.

54:53.115 --> 54:56.312
Um, it's not something
you really...

54:56.336 --> 54:59.296
You know, you don't
dwell on it, you know?

55:01.559 --> 55:03.580
Just don't like to... You know,
you don't like to bring up...

55:03.604 --> 55:08.150
Bring up the painful memories of losing...
losing your mates.

55:08.174 --> 55:09.891
What's that? A ten-count.

55:09.915 --> 55:12.635
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one. All right.

55:12.961 --> 55:14.852
Can I get another ten-count?

55:14.876 --> 55:16.941
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

55:16.965 --> 55:18.856
Okay.

55:18.880 --> 55:20.380
Anytime you guys are ready.

55:20.404 --> 55:22.643
Okay.

55:22.667 --> 55:24.906
Hey, everyone. I'm
Lauren Bohlander.

55:24.930 --> 55:26.821
I'm Scott Dixon.

55:26.845 --> 55:28.301
Oh, I'm not Scott Dixon.No.

55:28.325 --> 55:30.259
Sorry, I'm Dan Wheldon.

55:30.283 --> 55:34.219
Driver of the Number 10 Target Chip
Ganassi Racing Dallara Honda Firestone.

55:34.243 --> 55:35.438
Nice.

55:35.462 --> 55:37.875
A lot us where very
tight with Dan.

55:37.899 --> 55:39.834
He was a big personality.

55:39.858 --> 55:43.403
But especially with the group I mostly
hung out with... with Dario and Tony,

55:43.427 --> 55:45.535
and you know, we spent a
lot of time together.

55:45.559 --> 55:47.668
Here they come down the
front straightaway.

55:47.692 --> 55:50.347
And the final race for the
championship is green.

55:54.438 --> 55:58.156
I remember being terrified
the night before.

55:58.180 --> 55:59.723
Didn't go to sleep.

55:59.747 --> 56:02.596
There's the number 10
of Dario Franchitti.

56:02.620 --> 56:04.946
I think I was right behind
Dario, and you know,

56:04.970 --> 56:07.470
there was the two of us that,
kind of, sat on the bottom.

56:07.494 --> 56:10.386
Updating you as Tony
Kanaan is still leading.

56:10.410 --> 56:12.388
But, boy, the action
back behind him.

56:12.412 --> 56:13.868
He doesn't know
what he's missing.

56:13.892 --> 56:15.913
You could tell right
from the get-go,

56:15.937 --> 56:18.568
there was new guys, and other
people maybe with, you know,

56:18.592 --> 56:21.049
with a chip on their shoulder
that wanted to prove something.

56:21.073 --> 56:23.747
Oh, so close. And they're
touching right there.

56:23.771 --> 56:26.489
A lot of times as a driver, you're
in control of your own destiny.

56:26.513 --> 56:28.273
How much risk you're
willing to take,

56:28.297 --> 56:30.537
how fast you go through
a corner, to go faster,

56:30.561 --> 56:32.756
to distance yourself
from the others.

56:32.780 --> 56:34.105
Looking for Dan Wheldon.

56:34.129 --> 56:36.281
Started 34th in this field.

56:36.305 --> 56:38.153
You know, you could tell
right away there was

56:38.177 --> 56:40.764
something that was,
uh, gonna go down.

56:40.788 --> 56:42.462
And sure enough... Whoa!
Here we go!

56:42.486 --> 56:43.941
Trouble! Contact
and a huge crash!

56:43.965 --> 56:45.203
Go low! Go low!

56:45.227 --> 56:46.683
Oh! Up at car number 2.

56:46.707 --> 56:48.119
Oh! Multiple cars involved.

56:48.143 --> 56:49.730
Onboard with Will Power,

56:49.754 --> 56:51.016
and he's in the air!

56:58.632 --> 57:00.349
I remember trying to brake,

57:00.373 --> 57:02.873
and I think it was Scott
right in front of me.

57:02.897 --> 57:04.701
In all this commotion,
all I was looking at

57:04.725 --> 57:06.921
was trying to not hit
the car in front.

57:06.945 --> 57:09.513
And it all happened, I
didn't see any of it.

57:15.301 --> 57:18.193
The debris, it was just scattered
everywhere for, you know,

57:18.217 --> 57:22.221
a mile and a half of, you know, 15
to 20 Indy cars totally destroyed.

57:24.528 --> 57:28.333
I've seen, you know, many big
accidents, you know, pile-ups, before,

57:28.357 --> 57:30.534
but I'd never seen a
debris field like that.

57:35.843 --> 57:39.127
You know, there was a
driver's meeting called.

57:39.151 --> 57:41.458
And at that point, that's
not really normal.

57:43.503 --> 57:46.134
And the doctor came in and
shook his head and...

57:46.158 --> 57:47.899
Well, at that point
we knew Dan...

57:48.856 --> 57:49.901
was dead and...

57:56.777 --> 57:59.626
Don't ever say race car
drivers don't have emotions,

57:59.650 --> 58:01.303
that they feel nothing.

58:04.698 --> 58:09.331
I've never seen so many
race car drivers crying

58:09.355 --> 58:11.507
because we don't,
like, really do that.

58:11.531 --> 58:14.684
But you don't see
Scott Dixon cry ever.

58:14.708 --> 58:16.294
That guy... I mean...

58:16.318 --> 58:20.211
And some of the guys, we...
We hugged each other,

58:20.235 --> 58:22.257
you know, like, you know,
like as a group and...

58:23.543 --> 58:25.763
And there is... Tony,

58:26.807 --> 58:28.785
and... very distressed.

58:28.809 --> 58:32.746
And Tony just is a-a
great friend of Dan and,

58:32.770 --> 58:35.749
um, they hang out together, has
always hung out together...

58:35.773 --> 58:37.925
You know, we've heard
all the lines.

58:37.949 --> 58:41.581
"He was doing what he wanted to do.
He knew the risk."

58:41.605 --> 58:44.085
Uh, it doesn't make
the blow any softer.

58:46.610 --> 58:47.848
Yeah.

58:47.872 --> 58:49.482
We miss Dan.

58:57.098 --> 58:58.772
I think the hardest part was

58:58.796 --> 59:02.776
probably getting to Dan and Susie's
hotel room later that night,

59:02.800 --> 59:06.301
you know, and they'd just had
Oliver, uh, their youngest.

59:06.325 --> 59:10.392
You know, and even Sebastian at that time
would have only been, maybe two, I think.

59:10.416 --> 59:13.462
And, you know, totally oblivious to
what had happened, what had gone on.

59:16.596 --> 59:19.140
You know, I was hurting
too, you know, Emma was.

59:19.164 --> 59:23.231
But, you know, not on a level where
someone had just lost their husband.

59:23.255 --> 59:26.408
You know, uh, the kids had
just lost their father.

59:26.432 --> 59:29.914
You know, his parents had flown in and,
you know, they'd just lost their son.

59:33.352 --> 59:36.984
I've had this discussion many a times, when
people... like, when you lose friends,

59:37.008 --> 59:40.011
do you really think
about giving up?

59:55.766 --> 59:58.899
It's the only time I've seen
Scott cry is when Dan died.

01:00:13.392 --> 01:00:15.326
Is there another can, or is that the can?
That's it.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:16.990
That is the the can of
beans, Mr. Taggart.

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:23.813
The guys are very goal-oriented,
and they're very tight.

01:00:23.837 --> 01:00:25.728
They're a very good
working group.

01:00:25.752 --> 01:00:29.036
But things can go wrong

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.212
with any good group.

01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:34.041
And it's all in the recovery.

01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:44.791
So, how do you build your confidence
back up when things go wrong?

01:00:44.815 --> 01:00:47.837
Or how do you ensure that you're
still focusing on the right thing,

01:00:47.861 --> 01:00:49.970
or focusing not on the end goal
but maybe on your process,

01:00:49.994 --> 01:00:52.059
and how you're taking each step.

01:00:52.083 --> 01:00:54.844
Go, Matt. Whoa!

01:00:54.868 --> 01:00:56.130
Whoo!

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.544
Oh, tight!

01:00:59.568 --> 01:01:00.744
Whoo-hoo!

01:01:03.311 --> 01:01:05.159
They get frustrated and
angry with each other

01:01:05.183 --> 01:01:06.595
because they're all
perfectionists,

01:01:06.619 --> 01:01:07.988
and they want to win.

01:01:08.012 --> 01:01:10.120
So they'll get upset
for a minute,

01:01:10.144 --> 01:01:12.296
and then they'll, uh,
they'll think about things,

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.211
and then bring their guys
back together, and say,

01:01:14.235 --> 01:01:16.910
"As a group, we've got to
get this back together."

01:01:16.934 --> 01:01:18.152
And they do.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.169
Welcome to Watkins Glen,

01:01:59.193 --> 01:02:02.695
another beautiful day here
in mid-New York State.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:07.351
Obviously we're in a championship
chase here with the Nine car.

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:10.137
Let's do everything we can to
make sure that that happens.

01:02:10.161 --> 01:02:12.487
Anything we can do...

01:02:12.511 --> 01:02:14.513
that's within the
limit of the rules...

01:02:16.863 --> 01:02:19.494
I would appreciate you
guys know what to do.

01:02:19.518 --> 01:02:21.215
I don't need to be telling you.

01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:26.501
We feel pretty
confident and strong,

01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:29.939
and then something that we can't
control starts happening,

01:02:29.963 --> 01:02:31.312
and it's the weather.

01:02:34.228 --> 01:02:38.295
The difference between a wet setup
and a dry setup is massive.

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:40.428
So, do we start
with a wet setup?

01:02:40.452 --> 01:02:43.561
Because the ground is damp,
and the sky is dark,

01:02:43.585 --> 01:02:45.999
and our weather
says it's coming.

01:02:46.023 --> 01:02:48.262
Do we start with wet? Do we start with dry?
Wet? Dry? Wet? Dry?

01:02:48.286 --> 01:02:51.787
We keep thinking about it, and everybody
on the grid is thinking this too.

01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:55.486
So, Chris Simmons, he comes up
with a decision to go with wet.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:57.641
And he has the guys
changing gears, changing

01:02:57.653 --> 01:02:59.795
wings, changing
chassis adjustments.

01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:02.885
Massive changes on pre-grid, we're
getting called to the grid,

01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:04.800
and we're still changing gears.

01:03:04.824 --> 01:03:07.411
We were late getting
to our grid spot,

01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:09.762
but the guys got it done,
and it was the right call.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.851
If we hadn't, if we would
have just raced what we had,

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:14.114
we would be in back of the pack,
and it would've been over.

01:03:14.138 --> 01:03:18.379
I can't believe that Chris Simmons
can do this, as well as he can.

01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:21.251
You step back, and look, "I'm working
with some really good guys."

01:03:21.275 --> 01:03:22.905
Watkins Glen International,

01:03:22.929 --> 01:03:26.561
the scene of today's Verizon
IndyCar series race.

01:03:26.585 --> 01:03:28.456
The championship is at stake.

01:03:30.632 --> 01:03:34.874
Two races remain, and they're all
chasing the 26-year-old from Tennessee,

01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:37.814
Josef Newgarden has won three
of the last four races.

01:03:42.949 --> 01:03:45.710
Oh, boy, this is gonna be fascinating.
Get ready.

01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:48.844
It's the IndyCar Grand
Prix at The Glen.

01:03:48.868 --> 01:03:52.935
And Dixon determined to reduce that
deficit that he has to Josef Newgarden

01:03:52.959 --> 01:03:54.894
at the top of this championship.

01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:57.113
Everybody is starting
on wet weather tires,

01:03:57.137 --> 01:03:59.072
but they won't be on
them for very long.

01:03:59.096 --> 01:04:00.769
Coming onto the front straight,

01:04:00.793 --> 01:04:03.187
here at The Glen, it's
time to bring the action.

01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:06.906
Good start, Newgarden.
Look at him on the inside.

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:09.038
Three wide. Newgarden locks up.

01:04:09.062 --> 01:04:12.346
Can he keep it intact? He
does, but here comes Rossi.

01:04:19.551 --> 01:04:22.467
Everyone comes down pit
road, to get on the slicks.

01:04:34.044 --> 01:04:35.978
Charlie Kimball beats
Scott Dixon out.

01:04:36.002 --> 01:04:38.198
So Dixon lost quite a few spots.

01:04:38.222 --> 01:04:40.330
Newgarden defends
Dixon to the outside.

01:04:40.354 --> 01:04:42.158
Tough to go around the
outside here Paul,

01:04:42.182 --> 01:04:44.117
under the inner loop, but
he's already cleared him.

01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:46.467
Now he has gotten ahead of
his championship rival.

01:04:46.491 --> 01:04:48.885
Now he's got to chase
down Castroneves.

01:05:25.704 --> 01:05:27.638
Not a great stop
for Scott Dixon.

01:05:27.662 --> 01:05:30.641
He lost two positions again
on the pit stop exchange.

01:05:30.665 --> 01:05:33.581
He made it up, and now
he's dropped back again.

01:05:40.632 --> 01:05:43.611
Yeah, Josef got us
on that pit stop.

01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:05.111
Come on, Scotty.

01:06:05.135 --> 01:06:07.765
Will Power has the
pit out location.

01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:09.550
He's squeezes around.

01:06:09.574 --> 01:06:12.683
Josef Newgarden, the championship
leader in the orange and white car,

01:06:12.707 --> 01:06:14.729
he's gonna have to get around
Will Power coming out.

01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:17.079
Final stop for the two
Team Penske cars.

01:06:17.103 --> 01:06:20.082
And Josef Newgarden...
at the same time...

01:06:20.106 --> 01:06:21.954
and it's a drag
race to the line.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.825
And now we watch
how they blend in.

01:06:23.849 --> 01:06:26.349
Josef Newgarden totally
overcooked his pit exit.

01:06:26.373 --> 01:06:27.742
- Oh! Against the the wall.

01:06:27.766 --> 01:06:29.570
Oh! He gets hit!

01:06:29.594 --> 01:06:32.051
Suddenly, out of the blue, you
see in the corner of your eye,

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:35.315
you see one of the cars on
the TV wreck in pit lane.

01:06:35.339 --> 01:06:38.666
You see it's Josef. You
think, "Oh, my goodness."

01:06:50.615 --> 01:06:53.028
I hate that that's
happened to those guys,

01:06:53.052 --> 01:06:54.812
because you want to
beat them on merit.

01:06:54.836 --> 01:06:56.597
But he just screwed up.

01:06:56.621 --> 01:06:58.686
So... So you get really excited.

01:07:05.456 --> 01:07:07.695
We thought it was gonna
rain the whole race,

01:07:07.719 --> 01:07:10.872
we've had a nice, clean
dry race from the start.

01:07:10.896 --> 01:07:13.483
Man, big drama show today
for the Penske Team.

01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:14.856
Enormous.

01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:20.471
Rossi wins at The Glen.

01:07:21.689 --> 01:07:23.276
Over Scott Dixon,

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:27.304
this championship has tightened
way up, with one race to go.

01:07:29.175 --> 01:07:31.197
We're in the fight. Yes, we are.

01:07:31.221 --> 01:07:33.329
I didn't... I never
thought we weren't.

01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:34.896
Yeah, no. True.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.704
We're still in the
fight, I should say.

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:39.640
Good job, boys. Thanks, man.

01:07:39.664 --> 01:07:41.555
Sorry we didn't get the win, but...
No, it's all right.

01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:43.122
Scott Dixon finished second.

01:07:43.146 --> 01:07:44.558
But Scott, more importantly,

01:07:44.582 --> 01:07:47.387
you are now just three points
behind Josef Newgarden

01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:49.171
heading into double
points at Sonoma.

01:07:49.195 --> 01:07:51.434
What does that mean for
your race in two weeks?

01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:53.567
Yeah, definitely good, uh,
good recovery by the team.

01:07:53.591 --> 01:07:55.351
Ended up second. Good points.

01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:57.310
Uh, it's definitely
gonna be close,

01:07:57.334 --> 01:07:59.138
coming down to the
wire here for Sonoma,

01:07:59.162 --> 01:08:01.183
which I expect nothing less for
the Verizon IndyCar Series.

01:08:01.207 --> 01:08:03.490
So, I don't know, we're gonna
have to up our game at Sonoma,

01:08:03.514 --> 01:08:05.100
and see if we can, you know,

01:08:05.124 --> 01:08:07.518
carry away another
championship trophy.

01:08:09.607 --> 01:08:12.238
That was a good result.

01:08:12.262 --> 01:08:16.807
We took a big chunk out
of Newgarden's lead.

01:08:16.831 --> 01:08:19.182
All I know is we've got
to beat Newgarden.

01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:32.562
So many times in sports,
you have this, sort of,

01:08:32.586 --> 01:08:35.564
confluence of people,

01:08:35.589 --> 01:08:38.742
and of timing, and of equipment,

01:08:38.765 --> 01:08:42.180
and of the sport itself.

01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:46.228
You have this, sort of, coming
together at the right time.

01:08:46.252 --> 01:08:49.970
And Scott is somebody that wins with
the team and loses with the team,

01:08:49.995 --> 01:08:54.149
and I find that very
refreshing in today's world.

01:08:54.173 --> 01:08:55.890
No, I haven't spoken
to the girls yet.

01:08:55.913 --> 01:08:57.437
We should call them quickly.

01:09:02.964 --> 01:09:06.272
We were all young kids that
have known nothing but racing.

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.558
Remembering where you came
from, in this business,

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:13.410
defines who you are.

01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:22.134
My first memories go back
to when my dad was racing.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.787
Being in the pits
after the races.

01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:26.770
The... Pretty young back then,
three or four years old.

01:09:28.555 --> 01:09:30.663
Next thing you know, we're
building our own engines,

01:09:30.688 --> 01:09:33.536
and have two cars for me, and
two cars for my brother.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.433
And it was a real family sport, and
we traveled all over the country.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:44.156
Race has been part of my life since birth.
It's always been in my family.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.028
My dad started taking me to the
racetrack when I was really young.

01:09:47.051 --> 01:09:49.029
Sleeping on the
back of the trucks,

01:09:49.054 --> 01:09:50.858
you know, showering at the
track, kind of thing.

01:09:50.881 --> 01:09:53.381
Not getting a hotel, not
eating anywhere fancy.

01:09:53.406 --> 01:09:55.147
It was a really kind
of gypsy lifestyle.

01:10:00.935 --> 01:10:03.218
It starts out with a
love of the automobile.

01:10:03.242 --> 01:10:07.091
The kid across the street from me growing
up had a very, very fast go-kart.

01:10:07.115 --> 01:10:10.356
And that began the fire
for me in my belly.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.164
You know, I wanted to
drive that go-kart.

01:10:26.744 --> 01:10:30.898
I can't think of anything I'd
rather be doing than this business.

01:10:30.922 --> 01:10:33.683
But, uh, no, lots of
sacrifices you make.

01:10:33.707 --> 01:10:35.729
You know, I've been divorced.

01:10:35.753 --> 01:10:38.819
You know, my daughter, who had the
question from her at times about,

01:10:38.843 --> 01:10:42.586
uh, you know, maybe I wasn't at a
particular place while she was growing up.

01:10:45.893 --> 01:10:48.307
You get to a point in your
career where you think,

01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:52.093
"How do you best serve the sport that
you've grown up in and you love so much?"

01:10:53.814 --> 01:10:57.446
Today, I'm in it to win races
and win championships,

01:10:57.470 --> 01:11:01.189
and provide some return for
our partners and sponsors,

01:11:01.213 --> 01:11:03.800
and take this group of people that
I'm lucky enough to work with,

01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:07.587
and you know, provide a
valuable livelihood.

01:11:07.611 --> 01:11:09.937
Everything in life
is a trade-off.

01:11:09.961 --> 01:11:11.721
But, hey, let's face it.

01:11:11.745 --> 01:11:13.419
Winning is a hell
of a lot of fun.

01:11:13.443 --> 01:11:15.123
You know, when you win,
I mean, that's big.

01:11:16.184 --> 01:11:18.511
Yeah, and you know,

01:11:18.535 --> 01:11:21.818
who better to do it with than
the guy I'm doing it with?

01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:23.733
Well, you talk about
a Sunday drive.

01:11:23.757 --> 01:11:25.866
It's been that for
Scott Dixon today.

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:27.563
A lap to go.

01:11:27.587 --> 01:11:29.261
Here comes Dixon.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:31.959
Even at nine, 10, 11, I
would still wake up at,

01:11:31.983 --> 01:11:36.006
you know, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00 in the
morning to watch the Indianapolis 500.

01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:40.533
The speeds were excessive,
you know, 230 miles an hour.

01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:44.319
The style of racing and how
many passes were going on,

01:11:44.343 --> 01:11:46.669
uh, to how many different people
had the opportunity to win.

01:11:46.693 --> 01:11:48.216
That really intrigued me.

01:11:49.914 --> 01:11:55.156
And 2008 is the year that
stands out, uh, in my career.

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:57.530
Um, Emma and I get
married in February,

01:11:58.531 --> 01:12:01.293
win the 500 in May.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:05.122
And here's the winner of the
92nd Indianapolis 500-mile race.

01:12:05.146 --> 01:12:07.647
Scott Dixon from New Zealand.

01:12:07.671 --> 01:12:10.476
To win the Indianapolis 500,
it's such a strange feeling.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.087
And to actually be in
that moment, you know,

01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:15.568
we've just won, you know, the
biggest race in the world.

01:12:15.592 --> 01:12:18.875
The 92nd 500 winner,
Scott Dixon.

01:12:18.899 --> 01:12:22.575
The man from New Zealand who takes the
Borg-Warner trophy here at Indianapolis.

01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:25.055
The steps that we'd taken from,
you know, starting in go-karts

01:12:25.079 --> 01:12:28.842
to where we had got to
as a group, as a family,

01:12:28.866 --> 01:12:32.498
it magnified what it was all
for, and why, you know,

01:12:32.522 --> 01:12:34.543
there was blood, sweat and
tears put in, you know.

01:12:34.567 --> 01:12:36.656
Not just from me, but
from many people.

01:12:40.312 --> 01:12:42.986
I think when you're talking about
the greatest drivers of all time,

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:44.621
he may be there already.

01:13:05.076 --> 01:13:06.793
Racing has been
pretty much my life.

01:13:08.558 --> 01:13:11.275
You know, we have a
passion for competition,

01:13:11.299 --> 01:13:13.551
and, uh, any day we
don't win is, you know,

01:13:13.563 --> 01:13:15.826
we haven't... we haven't
completed our goal.

01:13:20.961 --> 01:13:22.180
Hi, Tilly.

01:13:23.529 --> 01:13:26.813
What are you doing? Good.

01:13:26.837 --> 01:13:30.556
How was, uh... How was school
on Thursday and Friday?

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:32.103
How did... How did that go?

01:13:36.673 --> 01:13:38.979
Oh. Well, we'll see you in
a day or two anyway, babe.

01:13:40.285 --> 01:13:42.698
I know, we'll try and...
We'll try and win.

01:13:42.722 --> 01:13:44.507
We'll be trying to win.

01:13:50.208 --> 01:13:52.534
Going into Sonoma,
coming off Watkins Glen,

01:13:52.558 --> 01:13:54.430
we're three points back.

01:13:56.954 --> 01:13:59.672
We knew we had our destiny
in our own hands.

01:13:59.696 --> 01:14:01.736
If we could win the race,
we'd win the championship.

01:14:03.743 --> 01:14:06.635
That was somewhat unexpected,
and a good feeling.

01:14:06.659 --> 01:14:09.401
But, uh, we also knew that
we were gonna be challenged.

01:14:10.837 --> 01:14:12.859
What a beautiful picture.

01:14:12.883 --> 01:14:18.236
Sonoma Raceway, hosting the 17th and final
round of the Verizon IndyCar Series.

01:14:21.848 --> 01:14:25.262
It's one of those tracks where I would
say, performance-wise as a team,

01:14:25.286 --> 01:14:28.614
we haven't really
always excelled there.

01:14:28.638 --> 01:14:30.790
It's a Penske strong track.

01:14:30.814 --> 01:14:35.403
You know, it's gonna be a really steep
uphill climb to try and overcome,

01:14:35.427 --> 01:14:38.537
uh, four very good cars,
four very good drivers,

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:41.259
and a, you know, one of the
best teams in history.

01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:44.804
You've also got Josef,

01:14:44.828 --> 01:14:46.980
uh, and he's, you know, going
in leading the championship.

01:14:47.004 --> 01:14:49.833
So it's a perfect storm
for a great story.

01:14:56.753 --> 01:15:00.496
That idea that Scott, and that the car that
I'm on, could win this championship...

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:06.695
I've never been to that point
in my IndyCar career before.

01:15:06.719 --> 01:15:08.286
It was nerve-wracking.

01:15:23.997 --> 01:15:25.975
This is why we're
in this business.

01:15:25.999 --> 01:15:28.978
It's for days like today. Okay?

01:15:29.002 --> 01:15:33.853
All the preparation, all
the work, all the sweat.

01:15:33.877 --> 01:15:37.291
All the effort that each and every
one of us have put in all year

01:15:37.315 --> 01:15:39.012
comes into a focus today.

01:15:40.884 --> 01:15:42.799
It's an opportunity for
great accomplishment.

01:15:44.757 --> 01:15:47.107
For more than one person, I
might add, in this room.

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:51.610
The only time you're gonna
keep me out of that car,

01:15:51.634 --> 01:15:54.134
is either if I'm dead,

01:15:54.158 --> 01:15:57.509
or if I can't really do it, because
a doctor tells me I can't.

01:16:00.077 --> 01:16:02.011
We live to race,

01:16:02.035 --> 01:16:05.928
everything else
comes around that.

01:16:05.952 --> 01:16:10.237
Your family, your wife,
your kids, everybody.

01:16:10.261 --> 01:16:12.829
They have to adapt
to your lifestyle.

01:16:22.447 --> 01:16:26.035
It's much easier to call somebody a
legend when they were... 20 years ago.

01:16:26.059 --> 01:16:28.211
But for somebody
that's current is,

01:16:28.235 --> 01:16:31.935
I think, people struggle more to
recognize just how good they are.

01:16:33.023 --> 01:16:35.567
Four championships so far,

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:38.550
you know, that fifth championship
would be incredible.

01:16:41.684 --> 01:16:43.444
I'll see you in a minute.
I'll wait here for you.

01:16:43.468 --> 01:16:44.668
See you at the car, okay? Yeah.

01:16:47.646 --> 01:16:48.971
You have butterflies, right?

01:16:48.995 --> 01:16:50.582
It's the last race,

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:53.889
and you have a legitimate
chance to win this thing.

01:16:53.913 --> 01:16:55.499
It's been a terrific season.

01:16:55.523 --> 01:16:58.328
Very, very tight from
start to finish.

01:16:58.352 --> 01:17:00.896
I've never seen it this
competitive in IndyCar.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:03.072
There's so many things, so many
scenarios I'm running through.

01:17:03.096 --> 01:17:04.596
It starts weighing on your mind.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.946
If we lose a lap, if we have
an extra long pit stop,

01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:09.625
if the car fails on track,
if we run out of fuel.

01:17:12.062 --> 01:17:15.258
And then you start thinking about all the
prize money that everyone is depending on,

01:17:15.282 --> 01:17:16.869
is based on this championship.

01:17:16.893 --> 01:17:18.697
So it's an awful lot of
responsibility and weight

01:17:18.721 --> 01:17:20.331
just sitting on your shoulders.

01:17:33.518 --> 01:17:36.715
It's the 17th, and final race
in the Verizon IndyCar Series.

01:17:36.739 --> 01:17:40.220
It's championship day, and
it's time to bring the action.

01:17:42.875 --> 01:17:44.877
Newgarden to the front.
Nice clean start.

01:18:00.588 --> 01:18:02.828
Starting the race, the start
of the race went well.

01:18:02.852 --> 01:18:05.439
Uh, past Sato, got
up to fifth place.

01:18:05.463 --> 01:18:07.746
Josef Newgarden, Will
Power, Hélio Castroneves,

01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:09.791
Simon Pagenaud, Scott Dixon.

01:18:09.815 --> 01:18:13.447
The championship five
are in the top five.

01:18:13.471 --> 01:18:15.391
And then that's when the
chaos started to happen.

01:18:17.562 --> 01:18:21.107
Whoa! Sato, the wild
thing in the dirt.

01:18:21.131 --> 01:18:24.066
We're hearing a report that James
Hinchcliffe may have left the track.

01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:25.938
He's way off the track.

01:18:25.962 --> 01:18:28.592
- Whoa! -Sideways on the
red, dirt everywhere.

01:18:28.616 --> 01:18:30.464
The guys at the wall.

01:18:30.488 --> 01:18:32.161
What a wild opening lap.

01:18:32.185 --> 01:18:33.534
Just carnage.

01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:46.785
Big cloud of dust. Cars
banging into each other.

01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:48.351
Everybody was slowing down.

01:18:48.375 --> 01:18:49.962
Kanaan is in trouble, I think.

01:18:49.986 --> 01:18:51.833
Kanaan has got bent suspension.

01:18:51.857 --> 01:18:54.749
Somebody hit him from behind. I think
he's either got a flat tire...

01:18:59.604 --> 01:19:01.669
And Kanaan, the teammate
to Scott Dixon.

01:19:01.693 --> 01:19:03.889
That is a huge blow for Dixon.

01:19:03.913 --> 01:19:08.526
He needs Kanaan in this race to help
support the championship fight.

01:19:42.995 --> 01:19:44.886
Well, the first stop
comes and goes.

01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:47.628
And we haven't changed positions
much, relative to the leader.

01:19:47.652 --> 01:19:51.023
It was four Penskes
versus Scott.

01:19:51.047 --> 01:19:52.894
Castroneves into turn Number 9

01:19:52.918 --> 01:19:55.505
with Scott Dixon skulking
just behind him,

01:19:55.529 --> 01:19:57.507
trying to close in.

01:19:57.531 --> 01:19:59.596
Oh, Scott Dixon just
lit up the tires

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.797
as he made a pass on
Hélio Castroneves.

01:20:34.786 --> 01:20:37.373
You're hoping of
something to switch it,

01:20:37.397 --> 01:20:38.964
uh, to try and switch
the strategy up.

01:20:42.489 --> 01:20:43.989
But Hélio is right on us.

01:20:44.013 --> 01:20:45.666
He's been stopping
every time we stop.

01:20:46.972 --> 01:20:48.104
They know our strategy.

01:20:57.330 --> 01:20:59.419
Penske covered all strategies.

01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:13.366
And then suddenly the
race starts to just...

01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:16.670
No one is passing, no one is doing anything
exciting. It's just a kind of a parade.

01:21:23.661 --> 01:21:26.509
I was doing all I could,
and still hanging onto,

01:21:26.533 --> 01:21:30.363
you know, the last five laps of the race
for something, you know, big to happen.

01:21:36.108 --> 01:21:37.999
I never give up.

01:21:38.023 --> 01:21:40.045
Scott never gives up.

01:21:40.069 --> 01:21:43.962
You have to be able to
square up to the mirror

01:21:43.986 --> 01:21:47.511
at the end of the day knowing full well
that you gave it everything you had.

01:21:53.212 --> 01:21:55.974
Scott Dixon, four-time champion,

01:21:55.998 --> 01:22:00.176
and it's looking increasingly difficult
to be a five-time champion here today.

01:22:01.873 --> 01:22:04.634
And I think the point
where you start to think,

01:22:04.658 --> 01:22:06.878
"Well, this isn't... This
isn't gonna happen."

01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:15.558
It's not... You don't
stop doing your job.

01:22:15.582 --> 01:22:17.367
You just... Your
heart just sinks.

01:22:19.108 --> 01:22:21.869
And now you're just watching
cars go round the track,

01:22:21.893 --> 01:22:24.765
watching somebody else...
win the championship.

01:22:32.164 --> 01:22:35.578
Dixon's ability to make something
happen is a miracle here,

01:22:35.602 --> 01:22:37.517
with half a lap to go.

01:22:41.173 --> 01:22:43.717
Simon Pagenaud wins in Sonoma.

01:22:43.741 --> 01:22:45.849
But Josef Newgarden is

01:22:45.873 --> 01:22:49.573
the 2017 Verizon IndyCar
Series champion.

01:22:54.447 --> 01:22:57.102
It's a reality now
for Josef Newgarden.

01:23:03.065 --> 01:23:05.347
Scott is a guy that

01:23:05.371 --> 01:23:10.309
unless he's going really
fast, he doesn't feel alive.

01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:13.945
He feels euphoric when
he's chancing death.

01:23:19.385 --> 01:23:22.234
Just as I was a seven-year-old
getting in a go-kart,

01:23:22.258 --> 01:23:24.976
is that it's the same thing.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.414
It's a race against your fellow
competitors, and you're trying to win.

01:23:28.438 --> 01:23:30.416
And that's... that's all it is.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.442
But there's so much
more going on now.

01:23:33.921 --> 01:23:36.813
It's not wanting to disappoint.

01:23:36.837 --> 01:23:40.513
Whether it's my parents, my
brothers and sisters, investors,

01:23:40.537 --> 01:23:42.123
you know, Emma, you
know, the kids,

01:23:42.147 --> 01:23:44.778
people that have helped
me along the way.

01:23:44.802 --> 01:23:46.127
Because I didn't give it my all,

01:23:46.151 --> 01:23:48.173
or because I made
a silly mistake,

01:23:48.197 --> 01:23:50.634
because I didn't
prepare well enough.

01:24:05.823 --> 01:24:09.107
Some days the reality
exceeds expectation,

01:24:09.131 --> 01:24:10.741
and some days you
accept the reality.

01:24:19.489 --> 01:24:20.770
Oh, well.

01:24:20.794 --> 01:24:21.839
Shit.

01:24:43.121 --> 01:24:44.620
Well done, baby. Thanks, babe.

01:24:44.644 --> 01:24:46.864
I'm sorry. It's
fucking annoying.

01:24:49.736 --> 01:24:51.714
Hey, Scott!

01:24:51.738 --> 01:24:52.889
Hey, Scott!

01:24:52.913 --> 01:24:54.891
The best team won, I guess.

01:24:54.915 --> 01:24:56.719
That's all you've got to say.

01:24:56.743 --> 01:24:59.113
We'll go get them next year.

01:24:59.137 --> 01:25:01.202
Have a couple of beers tonight,

01:25:01.226 --> 01:25:03.663
and we'll start planning
for next year tomorrow.

01:25:05.056 --> 01:25:06.164
It's all right. Next year.

01:25:06.188 --> 01:25:07.730
Congratulations on a
great season, Scott.

01:25:07.754 --> 01:25:09.123
Yeah. Well done, guys.

01:25:09.147 --> 01:25:10.864
Congrats. Congratulations
on a great season.

01:25:10.888 --> 01:25:13.606
You're the best. Oh, thank you.

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:15.825
Well, do you know what?
Next year it's all even...

01:25:15.849 --> 01:25:18.176
I'm so excited about
next year already.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.003
I don't think it was meant to...

01:25:20.027 --> 01:25:22.354
I think it was meant to be this way.
Do you?

01:25:22.378 --> 01:25:24.007
Yeah, I guess. I feel it.

01:25:24.031 --> 01:25:25.772
I love you. I'll be
back at the truck.Okay.
