WEBVTT

00:00.940 --> 00:07.089
last time on Baywatch Hawaii give me one

00:04.870 --> 00:11.349
team a small group of elite individuals

00:07.089 --> 00:15.159
Jesse's not here is that one of the wine

00:11.349 --> 00:19.719
lifeguards Keiko Tanaka and Holly Jason

00:15.159 --> 00:22.300
1909 hop up anything on me one thing one

00:19.719 --> 00:24.339
piece one person altogether

00:22.300 --> 00:26.289
I'm Shaun Munro gonna be setting up a

00:24.339 --> 00:28.449
lifeguard training center here this is

00:26.289 --> 00:29.379
the North Shore walk with people died

00:28.449 --> 00:32.618
here

00:29.379 --> 00:34.238
lifeguards die here to a solid favor

00:32.618 --> 00:35.979
gonna find the weak link

00:34.238 --> 00:37.779
I'm gonna send them home I've never been

00:35.979 --> 00:39.878
awake in my life that's not going to

00:37.780 --> 00:42.069
stop here the plant my ass but he sent

00:39.878 --> 00:43.820
me home i get something you get to be

00:42.069 --> 00:46.280
here only

00:43.820 --> 00:48.439
second but it turned out to be that you

00:46.280 --> 01:11.299
were the week not possible it would be

00:48.439 --> 01:14.900
pretty funny sterile

01:11.299 --> 01:15.890
this is part of training for a test of

01:14.900 --> 01:18.800
our ability

01:15.890 --> 01:20.480
exactly now before you jump from here

01:18.799 --> 01:22.429
and swim out to the boat

01:20.480 --> 01:28.370
I'm gonna give you a word to think about

01:22.430 --> 01:32.540
safe spell SS AFP it breaks down to

01:28.370 --> 01:33.469
speed strength agility flexibility and

01:32.540 --> 01:35.120
endurance

01:33.469 --> 01:38.569
these are attributes which all great

01:35.120 --> 01:41.420
lifeguards must have he gets the victim

01:38.569 --> 01:43.250
strength to hold them up

01:41.420 --> 01:45.799
agility to react to the conditions

01:43.250 --> 01:49.129
flexibility both mentally and physically

01:45.799 --> 01:51.079
for the unexpected and endurance because

01:49.129 --> 01:58.879
every rescue takes longer than you think

01:51.079 --> 02:00.679
it's going to now for each of you jump I

01:58.879 --> 02:10.008
want to give me one other characteristic

02:00.680 --> 02:13.740
a great life guard must have Jason

02:10.008 --> 02:26.939
instinct

02:13.740 --> 02:30.719
what

02:26.939 --> 02:42.990
jump

02:30.719 --> 02:46.050
go

02:42.990 --> 02:50.550
JD you're next

02:46.050 --> 02:51.360
I have to discipline and training and a

02:50.550 --> 02:54.000
question

02:51.360 --> 02:55.890
good i like questions a question

02:54.000 --> 02:59.520
indicates someone recognizes that we can

02:55.889 --> 03:00.569
all be ignorant and ignorance kills know

02:59.520 --> 03:02.250
what you're getting into and you

03:00.569 --> 03:04.469
eliminate surprises

03:02.250 --> 03:05.909
what's your question do you think my

03:04.469 --> 03:08.789
career as a lifeguard that I will ever

03:05.909 --> 03:11.069
have to make an absurdly from a 60-foot

03:08.789 --> 03:17.069
cliff in order to save a victim

03:11.069 --> 03:18.870
I don't know but probably not then the

03:17.069 --> 03:19.739
purpose of this exercise has nothing to

03:18.870 --> 03:22.349
do with life

03:19.740 --> 03:23.820
the purpose of this exercise is it's

03:22.349 --> 03:27.509
what I told you to do

03:23.819 --> 03:31.079
I'm looking for the weak link the person

03:27.509 --> 03:34.500
who's going to let this team down if you

03:31.080 --> 03:36.330
don't want to do this JD and don't and

03:34.500 --> 03:39.180
I've got my answer and you can go home

03:36.330 --> 03:41.490
doesn't bother me at all

03:39.180 --> 03:53.610
search comes from the right rip returns

03:41.490 --> 04:03.990
to the left that correct correct

03:53.610 --> 04:06.600
not that

04:03.990 --> 04:09.480
so what do you think Jesse that little

04:06.599 --> 04:11.609
hard on him just now I don't really know

04:09.479 --> 04:12.629
you well enough to say maybe you're

04:11.610 --> 04:15.750
always like this

04:12.629 --> 04:17.909
maybe you have any questions

04:15.750 --> 04:19.949
no I could care less why we're doing it

04:17.910 --> 04:22.320
i think it's fun

04:19.949 --> 04:24.000
so another attribute that is common to

04:22.319 --> 04:25.620
all great lifeguards physical

04:24.000 --> 04:30.449
conditioning which happens to include

04:25.620 --> 04:32.519
speed strength agility flexibility and

04:30.449 --> 04:50.379
endurance without having to use your

04:32.519 --> 05:00.109
cute little acronym

04:50.379 --> 05:04.879
I like acronyms

05:00.110 --> 05:07.310
anticipation most important attribute of

05:04.879 --> 05:09.409
all great lifeguards get to the victim

05:07.310 --> 05:23.550
before they get into trouble like the

05:09.410 --> 05:27.750
rescue on the sand good

05:23.550 --> 05:31.800
now I guess it's my turn

05:27.750 --> 05:33.240
no your water i like it when I was 12

05:31.800 --> 05:36.090
the first time I jumped off the sledge

05:33.240 --> 05:45.420
looks dangerous

05:36.089 --> 05:49.679
it's really pretty safe

05:45.420 --> 08:13.460
you want

05:49.680 --> 08:26.389
turn now

08:13.459 --> 08:29.659
by sallys and Ellie know it right Ali I

08:26.389 --> 08:32.690
love that saying Surfrider Malibu very

08:29.660 --> 08:33.349
evocative work at the beach live at the

08:32.690 --> 08:34.669
beach

08:33.349 --> 08:36.610
surround yourself with pictures of the

08:34.668 --> 08:40.778
beach and the 91

08:36.610 --> 09:02.499
no that sounds like a lot God guilty

08:40.778 --> 09:05.139
yeah take it easy

09:02.499 --> 09:12.069
are you going to store that here is that

09:05.139 --> 09:15.489
a problem only finding you sleep and are

09:12.068 --> 09:18.009
these drugs yours drugs is that what you

09:15.489 --> 09:19.658
call drugs weed German protein powder

09:18.009 --> 09:24.519
and maybe you're talking about the power

09:19.658 --> 09:25.778
bars where you goin don't leave now we

09:24.519 --> 09:29.229
haven't even gotten through the rolled

09:25.778 --> 09:31.389
oats the trail mix for my ginseng Jesse

09:29.229 --> 09:33.009
half of this room is mine

09:31.389 --> 09:43.209
I don't feel like falling over all of

09:33.009 --> 09:47.860
your crap every time I take a step

09:43.208 --> 09:49.419
naughty little friend take off that

09:47.860 --> 09:53.829
girlfriend of yours is a real breath

09:49.419 --> 09:54.969
take all the sky can't call Michael how

09:53.828 --> 09:57.008
longer be going to stay here until we

09:54.970 --> 09:59.319
move into the real headquarters sure the

09:57.009 --> 10:00.879
construction is finished with that I

09:59.318 --> 10:02.678
don't know mishandle yeah but look at

10:00.879 --> 10:06.039
this place isn't a beautiful

10:02.678 --> 10:09.039
yeah well it's not the place Jesse okay

10:06.039 --> 10:10.868
want to take a look at this basic work

10:09.039 --> 10:12.549
schedule since we're all gonna be living

10:10.869 --> 10:14.740
together put together a cleaning roster

10:12.549 --> 10:17.769
who does what when floors kitchen

10:14.740 --> 10:20.049
toilets and here i revise the LA County

10:17.769 --> 10:22.448
incident reports for a couple problems

10:20.049 --> 10:24.428
adjusting them to ye but nah I think

10:22.448 --> 10:26.349
they work now this is a combined

10:24.428 --> 10:27.938
physical training chart i know you

10:26.350 --> 10:30.189
probably got your own personal training

10:27.938 --> 10:32.558
schedule and like me hates get off my

10:30.188 --> 10:34.838
routine but i think the team should do

10:32.558 --> 10:36.338
some workouts together and these are

10:34.839 --> 10:40.119
some requisition form some time

10:36.339 --> 10:41.649
schedules and some efficiency steps I've

10:40.119 --> 10:44.350
always found it to be very helpful back

10:41.649 --> 10:45.730
in LA so if you can look those over and

10:44.350 --> 10:47.139
get back to appreciate it

10:45.730 --> 10:51.339
I don't have a personal training

10:47.139 --> 10:52.990
schedule you know hey i know i'm lillian

10:51.339 --> 10:58.940

11:03.289 --> 11:08.449
busting onions I don't need anything but

11:04.850 --> 11:10.759
I see me the thought of missing a rescue

11:08.450 --> 11:12.770
losing someone because we're not in the

11:10.759 --> 11:14.029
best possible physical condition we

11:12.769 --> 11:14.809
haven't paid enough attention to the

11:14.029 --> 11:18.529
details

11:14.809 --> 11:22.279
I can't take that that's a good point so

11:18.529 --> 11:23.870
