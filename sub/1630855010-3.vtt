00:10.889 --> 00:13.201
Corporate espionage
is a dirty way to get rich.

00:13.305 --> 00:15.583
- I'm not a spy.
- Uh, manipulating people

00:15.686 --> 00:18.931
and situations to influence
markets for client advantage

00:19.035 --> 00:21.140
- is what, then?
- Consulting.

00:21.244 --> 00:22.832
- Hailey.
- John.

00:22.935 --> 00:25.213
I swiped on you at the bar.
That's how I found you.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.525
No, it isn't.

00:26.628 --> 00:27.733
I need to know
who you really are,

00:27.837 --> 00:29.148
so start telling me.

00:29.252 --> 00:30.978
None of this shit happened
until I met you.

00:31.081 --> 00:33.946
Obviously, this was a big
mistake, so I am letting you go.

00:34.050 --> 00:36.500
You know what? Fuck no.

00:36.604 --> 00:37.639
- What?
- I'm not going.

00:37.743 --> 00:38.986
God, it's so good to see you.

00:39.089 --> 00:41.540
- It's been too long, huh?
- Yeah, it has.

00:41.643 --> 00:43.473
- It's a simple job.
- Why me?

00:43.576 --> 00:45.026
I know I can trust you.

00:45.130 --> 00:46.821
All we need to do is suggest
that the Banomar Group

00:46.925 --> 00:48.789
and the Treasury Department
investigator are somehow

00:48.892 --> 00:50.376
in bed together--
nothing tawdry,

00:50.480 --> 00:53.103
<i>just a few photographs

00:53.207 --> 00:54.484

There's video of you. Listen.

00:56.175 --> 00:59.006
They cut Weir in.
Valence fucked us.

01:01.905 --> 01:03.182
Were you in that explosion?

01:03.286 --> 01:05.150
- What the hell happened?
- This was not the plan.

01:05.253 --> 01:06.772
Shut up!

01:06.876 --> 01:08.360
Nothing has changed.

01:13.848 --> 01:15.091
Miles, no!

01:15.194 --> 01:17.921
How do I access
Valence's comms data?

01:18.025 --> 01:19.371
Without his password

01:19.474 --> 01:20.510

there's no getting in.

Nice to see you, too, Dad.

02:04.899 --> 02:07.660
<i>You need to know

02:07.764 --> 02:10.111
This is not cops and robbers

or three-dimensional chess

02:12.044 --> 02:15.047
or any game you've ever played.

02:15.151 --> 02:18.809
The enemy is everywhere,
but he can't be seen.

02:18.913 --> 02:21.916
The enemy is highly intelligent

02:22.020 --> 02:24.470
and highly resourceful.

02:24.574 --> 02:28.129
Eyes and ears
will be on you everywhere,

02:28.233 --> 02:31.408
and you must act accordingly.

02:31.512 --> 02:35.205
It requires absolute commitment
to the plan,

02:35.309 --> 02:38.760
absolute trust in one another,

02:38.864 --> 02:42.109
and absolute doubt
in anyone else.

02:42.212 --> 02:44.421
Now, if you can't do that--

02:44.525 --> 02:46.630
trust me

02:46.734 --> 02:49.047

Yes.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.933
I can't do this anymore.

04:57.037 --> 04:58.969
I am sending you away.

04:59.073 --> 05:01.593

05:01.696 --> 05:03.112

05:44.946 --> 05:46.638
Mr. Valence.

05:46.741 --> 05:49.572
Come up here and show Mr. Weir
how it's done.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.042
Hey, Miles.

06:12.146 --> 06:14.631
- Do you know this book?
- What?

06:14.735 --> 06:18.428
- Do you know it?
- No, but it looks interesting.

06:18.532 --> 06:20.706
I found this stuff by the safe.

06:20.810 --> 06:23.606
Lots of numbers,
and some are circled.

06:23.709 --> 06:25.780
And this article,
it's the same thing

06:25.884 --> 06:28.300
but with the letters circled.

06:28.404 --> 06:30.751
Maybe it's a cipher.

06:32.097 --> 06:34.203
A-A code kind of.

06:35.376 --> 06:37.067
Hold on.

06:38.897 --> 06:42.487
I learned a lot about this
for computer class.

06:42.590 --> 06:44.282
See? Code.

06:46.284 --> 06:49.977
I-I think that's what
he wrote there.

06:50.736 --> 06:52.462
Can you do it?

06:52.566 --> 06:56.086
I-I don't know.
What's in the safe?

06:56.190 --> 06:58.088
I don't know.

06:58.192 --> 07:00.574
Can you do it or not?

07:26.979 --> 07:29.534
Why do you want
to get in the safe so bad?

07:29.637 --> 07:32.088
Is there money
or something in it?

07:32.192 --> 07:34.124
I just want answers.

07:42.616 --> 07:45.688
Do you really think
the answer's in there?

07:45.791 --> 07:47.759
Just open it.

08:03.878 --> 08:05.466
<i>So, what's your pitch?</i>

08:05.570 --> 08:07.365
Your company
is the fastest-growing

08:07.468 --> 08:09.746
snack food brand
in the entire world.

08:09.850 --> 08:13.198
Your Macaroni and Cheese Puffs
are a huge hit.

08:14.234 --> 08:15.304
Your stock price is riding high

08:15.407 --> 08:16.891
because of
record-breaking sales.

08:16.995 --> 08:18.755
And right about now,
you're wondering,

08:18.859 --> 08:20.654
"What the fuck
do I need these guys for?"

08:20.757 --> 08:23.346
VALENCE [chuckles]: That's
because your main competitor,

08:23.450 --> 08:25.900
Unified Grain Mills,
they're in the process right now

08:26.004 --> 08:28.075
of testing a copycat product,

08:28.178 --> 08:29.525
Mac Cheezies.

08:29.628 --> 08:31.561
And they have three times
your marketing reach,

08:31.665 --> 08:33.460
so when they enter the space,

08:33.563 --> 08:35.255
you're gonna see
a huge dent in your sales.

08:35.358 --> 08:38.913
Your earnings in Q4 and beyond
are gonna take a massive hit.

08:39.017 --> 08:41.122
But we can buy you time.

08:41.226 --> 08:42.469
Yeah, I'm listening.

08:42.572 --> 08:44.678
It's called
a mass psychogenic event.

08:44.781 --> 08:47.819
In layman's terms,
simple hysteria.

08:47.922 --> 08:51.650
<i>Our operatives can easily
infiltrate Unified's test groups</i>

08:51.754 --> 08:54.135
<i>and identify recruits
prone to suggestion.</i>

08:54.239 --> 08:56.552
Is it hot?

08:56.655 --> 08:58.381
Are you hot?

08:58.485 --> 09:00.763
No, not really.

09:00.866 --> 09:03.559
<i>Then, with a few
carefully placed reactions,</i>

09:03.662 --> 09:06.769
<i>we would induce
a nightmare scenario for them.</i>

09:06.872 --> 09:09.185
Yeah. It's hot.

09:10.290 --> 09:12.499
Feeling a little queasy, too.

09:12.602 --> 09:15.778
Uh, I guess it's a little warmer
than I'd like.

09:15.881 --> 09:17.366
Hey, what's in this shit?

09:17.469 --> 09:19.299
<i>We're confident such an event...</i>

09:19.402 --> 09:20.921
I'm gonna puke.

09:21.024 --> 09:23.406
I-I don't feel so good.

09:23.510 --> 09:25.822
<i>...would derail Unified's
release of Mac Cheezies</i>

09:25.926 --> 09:27.341
<i>for at least a year.</i>

09:27.445 --> 09:29.723
I'm nauseous.
Can I go to the bathroom?

09:29.826 --> 09:31.172
Sir, could you please
stay in your seat?

09:31.276 --> 09:32.726
I'm gonna throw up.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.178
That is the craziest shit
I've ever heard.

09:37.282 --> 09:38.801
You can really do that?

09:38.904 --> 09:40.181
Yeah, it's science.

09:40.285 --> 09:41.700
Not only can we do it.

09:41.804 --> 09:43.909
We guarantee it.

09:44.013 --> 09:46.809
Where do I sign?

09:48.293 --> 09:49.639
I think congratulations
are in order.

09:49.743 --> 09:51.261
You, too, brother.

09:51.365 --> 09:53.367
I, uh, I just wanted
to show you something

09:53.471 --> 09:54.782
that I've been batting around,
all right?

09:54.886 --> 09:57.475
- Sure.
- It's, uh, an interesting metric

09:57.578 --> 09:59.615
that I found on a study

09:59.718 --> 10:02.307
about the data
that Facebook uses.

10:02.411 --> 10:03.826
- Sure.
- Now, it was designed

10:03.929 --> 10:05.517
to determine
if someone's preferences--

10:05.621 --> 10:07.864
so, their behavior really--

10:07.968 --> 10:10.315
could be predicted
by a computer model

10:10.419 --> 10:12.421
based solely on their likes.

10:12.524 --> 10:13.939
And, according to the study,

10:14.043 --> 10:15.803
the model was able to predict
someone's behavior

10:15.907 --> 10:19.324
better than a coworker
after just ten likes.

10:19.428 --> 10:22.362
After 150 likes,
it beat their parents.

10:22.465 --> 10:23.846
After 300 likes,

10:23.949 --> 10:26.504
the model was more accurate
than their spouse.

10:26.607 --> 10:28.333
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

10:28.437 --> 10:30.611
Look, we know
psychology, behavior,

10:30.715 --> 10:32.855
and we sure know
how to make money at it,

10:32.958 --> 10:34.960
but this big data thing,

10:35.064 --> 10:36.928
it can just...

10:37.031 --> 10:39.517
figure it out bigger,
better, faster than us.

10:39.620 --> 10:43.383
Now, we could build a simulation

10:43.486 --> 10:45.971
and just take
all of that raw data,

10:46.075 --> 10:48.905
taking it easily from somewhere
like social media

10:49.009 --> 10:51.425
or databases or online polls,

10:51.529 --> 10:54.739
and we could process it all
for sale to businesses

10:54.842 --> 10:56.430
or politicians

10:56.534 --> 10:59.468
or law enforcement, governments.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.849
I mean, they would pay
huge money for whatever

11:01.953 --> 11:04.127
that data could tell them
about people

11:04.231 --> 11:07.130
and how to predict
or motivate their behaviors.

11:07.234 --> 11:11.203
I mean, you can see where
this is all gonna go, right?

11:11.307 --> 11:12.929
Yeah, of course.

11:13.033 --> 11:14.862
I mean, yes.

11:16.139 --> 11:18.487
But is this really
what we want to be doing?

11:18.590 --> 11:19.833
John, this is what
we're doing already

11:19.936 --> 11:21.593
with these rich pricks,
isn't it?

11:21.697 --> 11:23.595
Using our knowledge
against them?

11:23.699 --> 11:27.150
This is just bigger
and much more profitable.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.326
I mean, this is the future.

11:30.430 --> 11:31.983
You know I'm right.

11:32.086 --> 11:34.364
So, let's be a part of it.

11:34.468 --> 11:36.781
All right, you just...

11:36.884 --> 11:39.231
you just promise me that
you're gonna think about it,

11:39.335 --> 11:40.405
okay?

11:40.509 --> 11:42.787
I don't need to.

11:42.890 --> 11:44.582
I'm in.

11:44.685 --> 11:46.756

- Yeah.

I think you're better
than that, John.

13:21.989 --> 13:24.889
The door wasn't forced.
I'm not a common criminal.

13:24.992 --> 13:27.132
I'm not searching the place
for a cash box.

13:27.236 --> 13:30.170
I'm just playing your hi-fi
and waiting for you.

13:30.273 --> 13:33.069
Okay, Moriarty, you want
a meeting, call my office.

13:33.173 --> 13:34.588
Now, please leave.

13:34.692 --> 13:37.280
John, it's me.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.697
I said leave.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.009
Maybe you want to sit down.

13:42.113 --> 13:45.081
Acute shock,
it can manifest itself

13:45.185 --> 13:47.359
in a variety of ways.

13:47.463 --> 13:50.328
Denial, sublimation of reality,

13:50.431 --> 13:52.364
is a common reaction.

13:52.468 --> 13:55.644
I'm a psychologist.
I should know.

13:55.747 --> 13:58.232
A psychologist, John,

13:58.336 --> 14:00.890
like your father.

14:03.583 --> 14:05.999
Dad?

14:12.039 --> 14:14.973
I think we should sit,
take a moment.

14:15.077 --> 14:16.665
We don't have to talk,
just absorb,

14:16.768 --> 14:19.668
and-and I will explain everything.

14:22.981 --> 14:24.327
What did you do?

14:24.431 --> 14:26.019
No, it had to be done.
Your lives were in danger.

14:26.122 --> 14:28.849
- If you will just sit down...
- What the fuck did you do?

14:28.953 --> 14:31.369
Things went wrong.
You weren't supposed to know.

14:31.472 --> 14:33.543
Now, if you would just sit down.

14:33.647 --> 14:35.891
Stop saying that.

14:37.927 --> 14:40.792
What is this?
What do you want from me?

14:42.173 --> 14:44.554
I need your help.

14:44.658 --> 14:46.177
Are you fucking kidding?

14:46.280 --> 14:49.145
Who are you?
Where the fuck have you been?

14:49.249 --> 14:51.492
I had to make a choice.
Now, I'll understand...

14:51.596 --> 14:53.046
Oh, a choice?
This was all a choice?

14:53.149 --> 14:55.669
Believe me, John, if it
wasn't absolutely necessary,

14:55.773 --> 14:58.603
I wouldn't be here.

14:59.431 --> 15:02.434
I've run out of places to go.

15:02.538 --> 15:04.264
Wow.

15:06.059 --> 15:09.407
M-My mom-- your wife--
she ran out of places to go.

15:09.510 --> 15:11.133
She died because of you.

15:11.236 --> 15:14.032
She knew, John.

15:18.485 --> 15:19.728
Dad?

15:21.902 --> 15:24.111
Dad?

15:24.215 --> 15:26.182
Dad? Dad!

15:29.323 --> 15:31.774
Oh, John.

15:31.878 --> 15:34.018
It's too late. It's too late.

15:34.121 --> 15:35.951
I know.

15:37.021 --> 15:39.886
No! No!

15:39.989 --> 15:41.404
She knew I had to do something.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.268
Look, he has to be stopped,
you understand?

15:43.372 --> 15:44.649
Okay, you need to go.

15:44.753 --> 15:46.202
No, it took me a long time
to find him,

15:46.306 --> 15:48.066
and, finally, I got him,
and then the bastard

15:48.170 --> 15:49.689
went and blew up
the goddamn plane.

15:49.792 --> 15:51.173
- Just get out.
- Now he's here.

15:51.276 --> 15:53.865
- You must believe me.
- Believe you?

15:53.969 --> 15:55.487
That's never gonna happen.

15:55.591 --> 15:58.283
Get the fuck out
of my apartment now.

15:58.387 --> 15:59.802
Please.

15:59.906 --> 16:01.977
Just go.

16:04.117 --> 16:06.947
Get the fuck out
of my apartment!

16:07.051 --> 16:09.087
Now!

16:09.191 --> 16:11.711
Drink.

16:11.814 --> 16:14.644
John, come on.

16:14.748 --> 16:16.750
Come on.

16:27.588 --> 16:28.831
Here.

16:28.935 --> 16:32.076
"Safety in numbers," right?

16:36.425 --> 16:37.909
You're still taking
that Paxil, yeah?

16:38.013 --> 16:40.740
It was him.
I didn't imagine this.

16:40.843 --> 16:41.982
It was definitely him.

16:42.086 --> 16:44.605
What's his fucking game?
I mean, why now?

16:46.331 --> 16:48.161
He was going on about
conspiracies everywhere.

16:48.264 --> 16:50.232
I mean, real paranoid,
delusional shit.

16:50.335 --> 16:53.166
He sounds incredibly sick.

16:53.269 --> 16:56.756
- Probably where I get it from.
- Yeah, probably.

16:58.171 --> 17:01.277
Should I...
should I call someone, or...?

17:01.381 --> 17:03.763
Okay, okay.

17:03.866 --> 17:06.317
What are you feeling?

17:06.420 --> 17:08.112
It's not good.

17:08.215 --> 17:11.701
You mean, like,
eight years ago not good or...?

17:13.186 --> 17:14.635
Not yet.

17:14.739 --> 17:16.223
Fuck, I can't go
through that again.

17:16.327 --> 17:17.915
I cannot let my mind go down
that fucking rabbit hole.

17:18.018 --> 17:19.571
- I know it's possible...
- It's okay.

17:19.675 --> 17:21.401
We got through it before.
I will be here to do it again

17:21.504 --> 17:23.713
if I have to, okay? Okay?

17:23.817 --> 17:25.646
- It'll be okay.
- Thank you.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.579
Take a breath.

17:27.683 --> 17:29.789
- Just breathe.
- Yeah.

17:35.001 --> 17:36.899
He said my mom knew.

17:37.003 --> 17:39.384
- What, that he was alive?
- Yeah.

17:39.488 --> 17:41.559
Come on.

17:41.662 --> 17:43.043
No way.

17:43.147 --> 17:44.769
I always thought she drank
because he died.

17:44.873 --> 17:47.910
Maybe she drank
because she knew he didn't.

17:49.394 --> 17:51.017
Oh, fuck.

17:52.121 --> 17:53.398
I built an entire life

17:53.502 --> 17:54.917
around everything
we found in that safe.

17:55.021 --> 17:56.125
- Yeah.
- My psych degree,

17:56.229 --> 17:57.678
everything I am,

17:57.782 --> 17:59.646
everything I know is predicated
on my life experience,

17:59.749 --> 18:02.407
and now I'm supposed to just
accept that it's all bullshit?

18:02.511 --> 18:03.892
Fuck no!

18:03.995 --> 18:06.170
Or he's fucking nuts, John.

18:06.273 --> 18:08.344
He keeps going on about
this guy named Crowley

18:08.448 --> 18:10.036
and some new world order
that's set up

18:10.139 --> 18:11.658
to hijack governments
and take over the world.

18:11.761 --> 18:13.142
I mean, real
<i>Manchurian Candidate</i> shit.

18:14.764 --> 18:17.595
He thinks he's some kind
of super spy. It's insane.

18:17.698 --> 18:19.045
Clearly.

18:19.148 --> 18:21.288
- Did he have any proof?
- Of course not.

18:21.392 --> 18:24.119
I mean, he said he had a guy
who was bringing him proof,

18:24.222 --> 18:27.156
who was on the AeroDelhi flight
disappeared last year.

18:27.260 --> 18:29.227
- That's convenient.
- Yeah, convenient.

18:29.331 --> 18:31.505
You're just supposed to
take him at his word now, too?

18:31.609 --> 18:34.060
He tried telling me about
all these top-secret operations

18:34.163 --> 18:35.889
that would, one day,
come to light,

18:35.993 --> 18:37.822
vindicate everything
that he was saying.

18:37.926 --> 18:39.686
What kind of operations?

18:39.789 --> 18:41.308
Crazy shit, like...

18:41.412 --> 18:43.379
like the Russians
secretly orchestrating

18:43.483 --> 18:45.692
a terrorist-style attack
on the Panama and Suez Canal

18:45.795 --> 18:48.177
so they'd have the only viable
trade route to sell oil

18:48.281 --> 18:51.111
to Europe and North America.
I mean, ridiculous, right?

18:51.215 --> 18:53.424
I mean, the rest of the world
wouldn't stand by

18:53.527 --> 18:56.082
and let that happen, right?

18:57.290 --> 18:58.878
Right.

19:00.362 --> 19:01.881
Right.

19:04.159 --> 19:07.196
He's a fucking nutcase,

19:07.300 --> 19:09.958
and you should forget
you ever saw him.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.790
<i>REPORTER [over TV]:
In a joint terrorist attack,</i>

19:14.894 --> 19:16.619
<i>simultaneous explosions rocked</i>

19:16.723 --> 19:19.105
<i>both the Suez and Panama Canals,</i>

19:19.208 --> 19:21.245
<i>crippling the global economy
as this critical trade route...</i>

19:21.348 --> 19:22.832
<i>In our early Agency days,</i>

19:22.936 --> 19:24.317
we developed techniques

19:24.420 --> 19:26.664
on how to manipulate populations.

19:26.767 --> 19:28.183
You know, you saw the research.

19:28.286 --> 19:30.185
The Algorithms of Control.

19:30.288 --> 19:32.601
We used them
to undermine elections,

19:32.704 --> 19:36.260
sway public support
and elect favorable regimes.

19:37.709 --> 19:40.781
All that mattered
was that those governments

19:40.885 --> 19:44.130
fell in line
with U.S. interests.

19:44.233 --> 19:46.063
But Crowley
didn't see it that way.

19:46.166 --> 19:49.825
Crowley saw it
through darkened eyes.

19:51.378 --> 19:54.347
He started selling
our cutting-edge psyops

19:54.450 --> 19:56.625
as a service
to foreign governments

19:56.728 --> 19:59.041
and to businesses on the side.

19:59.145 --> 20:01.216
Highest bidder, all come.

20:02.838 --> 20:05.496
I've been out there,
tracking him,

20:05.599 --> 20:08.982
hunting him, watching him
help oligarchs and dictators.

20:09.086 --> 20:12.020
You pick your scumbag,
Crowley's worked for him.

20:12.123 --> 20:14.160
I almost had him once.

20:14.263 --> 20:16.300
I even stopped a genocide.

20:16.403 --> 20:18.612
Well, almost.

20:19.441 --> 20:21.581
But now he's not
working for hire.

20:21.684 --> 20:24.101
He's got so much money,
it's not about that anymore.

20:24.204 --> 20:26.034
It's about power.
He wants power.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.967
He wants a regime of his own,

20:28.070 --> 20:30.176
and he wants it right here.

20:30.279 --> 20:33.593
Here? Come on.
How do you know that?

20:33.696 --> 20:35.422
Because I wrote the book.

20:35.526 --> 20:39.116
Chapter one, undermine
people's faith in the media

20:39.219 --> 20:41.981
so they begin to doubt
the very nature of the truth.

20:42.084 --> 20:44.017
Chapter two,

20:44.121 --> 20:46.261
polarize factions in society.

20:46.364 --> 20:48.401
When people stop seeing
the other side as human,

20:48.504 --> 20:51.714
then human rights
cease to be an obstacle.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.027
Chapter three,

20:54.131 --> 20:56.754
marginalize the intelligentsia.

20:56.857 --> 20:58.583
If people stop listening
to experts,

20:58.687 --> 21:00.654
then they become malleable. Hmm?

21:00.758 --> 21:03.347
That sound familiar?

21:03.450 --> 21:05.763
Chapter four--
now, you'll need chapter four--

21:05.866 --> 21:10.009
elect a candidate under
the guise of restoring order.

21:10.112 --> 21:12.011
Someone smart,
someone charismatic,

21:12.114 --> 21:15.083
but someone who can...
can be controlled.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.050
What's chapter five?

21:17.154 --> 21:19.535
Oh, there's no chapter five.

21:19.639 --> 21:21.365
Now the country's yours.

21:22.435 --> 21:24.609
Yes. Oh, yeah.

21:24.713 --> 21:27.716
The bottom line is,
it's happening right now,

21:27.819 --> 21:30.167
a lot faster
than I thought it would.

21:30.270 --> 21:32.376
Maybe by even the next election.

21:32.479 --> 21:36.104
- That soon?
- Yeah.

21:36.207 --> 21:38.589
Time is running out
for me, John.

21:38.692 --> 21:40.487
I'm fucking old.

21:42.593 --> 21:45.113
This is too much for me
to do on my own.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.184
Now, you two both know my work.

21:47.287 --> 21:50.187
You've built a career out of
what you found in that safe.

21:50.290 --> 21:54.467
You're the only people
who can help me do this.

21:54.570 --> 21:57.435
Full stop.

21:57.539 --> 21:59.196
Tell me I'm wrong.

21:59.299 --> 22:03.062
Are you gonna help me
get the son of a bitch?

22:12.588 --> 22:14.487
<i>Police continue to search</i>

22:14.590 --> 22:16.213
<i>for a man in connection
with the murder</i>

22:16.316 --> 22:18.353
<i>of U.S. Treasury official
Edward Homm.</i>

22:18.456 --> 22:21.252
<i>The suspect, John Weir,
is still at large</i>

22:21.356 --> 22:23.599
<i>as both local

22:23.703 --> 22:25.118

22:25.222 --> 22:27.258
<i>In Washington,

22:29.191 --> 22:30.951
<i>in the House this week,

22:31.055 --> 22:32.574
<i>in many major cities.</i>

22:32.677 --> 22:34.334
<i>Though support

22:34.438 --> 22:36.267
<i>sponsors hope

22:38.338 --> 22:40.547
<i>I don't know how

22:40.651 --> 22:42.860
<i>I don't know why
you can't just let it go.</i>

22:42.963 --> 22:45.276
I like the taste
of turkey bacon.

22:45.380 --> 22:47.623
It's not some big
political thing. I just like it.

22:47.727 --> 22:49.625
Oh, come on, John,
it's disgusting.

22:49.729 --> 22:53.664
Turkey bacon, it tastes like
salted asshole.

22:53.767 --> 22:55.597
Nice.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.530
Listen, this whole low-fat craze

22:57.633 --> 23:00.049
was a campaign
to sell more wheat goods.

23:00.153 --> 23:02.121
Big Ag financed those studies

23:02.224 --> 23:04.330
and got the feds
to back them up.

23:04.433 --> 23:06.021
The messaging scared
the shit out of people,

23:06.125 --> 23:07.574
they sold a shitload of pasta

23:07.678 --> 23:10.025
and created a country
full of fat diabetics.

23:10.129 --> 23:13.408
How my own son can be taken in
by that is beyond belief.

23:13.511 --> 23:15.893
Can we please just get back
to what we were talking about?

23:15.996 --> 23:18.171
All right. What else is there?

23:18.275 --> 23:20.518
The girl. She's a wild card.
She's got to go.

23:20.622 --> 23:22.969
- I don't think she's involved.
- Are you 100% on that?

23:23.072 --> 23:24.350
Of course not.

23:24.453 --> 23:25.937
Well, there you go,
it's Occam's Razor.

23:26.041 --> 23:27.560
You want to be 100%,
we kill her.

23:27.663 --> 23:29.838
Oh, my God. Would you please
stop with the CIA bullshit?

23:29.941 --> 23:31.011
We're not gonna kill her.

23:31.115 --> 23:32.461
It's standard procedure.
I can do it.

23:32.565 --> 23:34.118
Would you please stop?

23:34.222 --> 23:36.085
You said he wasn't
gonna do this again.

23:36.189 --> 23:38.260
I know what I said.
Trust me, you're fine.

23:38.364 --> 23:40.469
Well, it was standard
procedure in the '80s.

23:40.573 --> 23:42.161
Now? Fuck knows.

23:42.264 --> 23:43.679
Too much Agency oversight.

23:43.783 --> 23:46.061
- I blame Bill Clinton.
- This man raised you?

23:46.165 --> 23:47.545
No, thank God.

23:47.649 --> 23:49.789
And I promise you,
he's not gonna kill anybody.

23:49.892 --> 23:52.240
Listen, I was just thinking
out loud. All right, calm down.

23:52.343 --> 23:53.862
Don't take it personally, sweetheart.

23:53.965 --> 23:55.312
We had a plan.

23:55.415 --> 23:56.727
Which he decided to ignore

23:56.830 --> 23:59.005
and take a lot of risks
because he can't face up

23:59.108 --> 24:01.318
to the fact that his best friend
flipped on him

24:01.421 --> 24:03.112
and then topped himself
when he got found out.

24:03.216 --> 24:04.700
Please, stop trying
to psychoanalyze me.

24:04.804 --> 24:06.806
Well, who's got the doctorate
around here, me or you?

24:06.909 --> 24:08.221
You haven't practiced
psychology in decades.

24:08.325 --> 24:09.809
Wait, what?

24:09.912 --> 24:11.776
You're-you're a psychologist?
You know what?

24:11.880 --> 24:13.640
Next time you want to fake
your own suicide,

24:13.744 --> 24:15.055
don't fake it.

24:15.159 --> 24:16.333
Wait, what?!

24:16.436 --> 24:17.713
You weren't supposed to know.

24:17.817 --> 24:19.405
How many more times
do I have to say it?

24:19.508 --> 24:21.165
We agreed to leave this
in the past,

24:21.269 --> 24:23.098
but you keep bringing it up.

24:23.202 --> 24:24.893
Fine, whatever.

24:24.996 --> 24:27.033
It's not as if I beat you.

24:27.136 --> 24:29.691
I was there for you.

24:29.794 --> 24:32.452
I was there when you played
the turkey in the play.

24:32.556 --> 24:34.040
Oh, my God!

24:34.143 --> 24:36.387
That was kindergarten. A lot
of stuff has happened since.

24:36.491 --> 24:39.183
Oh, yeah, you faking
your fucking suicide!

24:39.287 --> 24:41.737
Oh, God, no wonder
you're so fucked up.

24:41.841 --> 24:43.463
What?

24:43.567 --> 24:45.810
I think I've done really well,
given the circumstances.

24:45.914 --> 24:48.088
Did you really do that?
How old was he?

24:48.192 --> 24:49.642
Eat your eggs.

24:49.745 --> 24:50.815
- Ten.
- Ten?

24:50.919 --> 24:52.714
That's so fucked up.

24:52.817 --> 24:54.716
How long did you think
he was dead for?

24:54.819 --> 24:56.062
Would you eat your eggs
and shut up?!

24:56.165 --> 24:57.374
Excuse me?

24:57.477 --> 24:58.823
Hey, don't be an asshole to her.

24:58.927 --> 25:01.274
She's got nothing to do
with this. 35 years.

25:01.378 --> 25:03.242
- Oh, God. For real?
- For real.

25:03.345 --> 25:05.209
Enough. Listen, can we get back
to the plan?

25:05.313 --> 25:07.176
- And you forgave him?
- No, not entirely.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.488
Oh, God, I don't even know how

25:08.592 --> 25:10.110
you can be
in the same room with him.

25:10.214 --> 25:12.941
Oh, God, that's it, I'm gonna
blow a fuse in a minute, really.

25:13.044 --> 25:15.702
We should probably stop talking
about this right now. Look.

25:15.806 --> 25:19.016
We need to know
what Valence knew, okay?

25:19.119 --> 25:21.156
And I think that this...

25:21.260 --> 25:23.227
will do that.

25:23.331 --> 25:25.471
Always stick to the plan, remember?

25:25.574 --> 25:28.301
Breaking into Valence's comms
is not part of it.

25:28.405 --> 25:30.165
We need to get
that Homm to talk.

25:30.269 --> 25:33.064
Maybe we don't. Maybe this is
all we need to find Crowley.

25:33.168 --> 25:35.032
Who's Crowley?
Just eat your eggs.

25:35.135 --> 25:37.068
Stop saying that! No.

25:37.172 --> 25:38.587
Valence turned on us. Face it.

25:38.691 --> 25:40.279
I don't know that
with absolute certainty.

25:40.382 --> 25:42.315
Right now, nothing is adding up.

25:42.419 --> 25:44.317
They found Valence dead
with a gun? He hated guns.

25:44.421 --> 25:46.423
The look he gave me
right before he jumped?

25:46.526 --> 25:49.046
I can't even explain that.

25:49.149 --> 25:50.634
But, look, may-maybe he was just

25:50.737 --> 25:52.498
trying to protect me
from something.

25:52.601 --> 25:54.362
The only thing
that I'm certain about right now

25:54.465 --> 25:56.364
is that absolutely
none of this makes sense.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.573
No, Crowley got to him,
plain and simple.

25:58.676 --> 26:00.678
Face it, it's a mind game, John.

26:00.782 --> 26:03.647
And you're being sucked in
instead of staying on mission.

26:03.750 --> 26:05.614
The last message
that Valence got--

26:05.718 --> 26:07.547
"Do it now"--
that was from Crowley.

26:07.651 --> 26:09.411
Now, if I can access
Valence's comms data,

26:09.515 --> 26:10.930
I can trace that call

26:11.033 --> 26:12.621
right back to the source.
Enough already!

26:12.725 --> 26:14.796
Homm will lead us to Crowley.
That was the plan!

26:14.899 --> 26:17.108
We bloody near killed ourselves
to pull it off.

26:17.212 --> 26:19.179
So let's get him to talk.

26:19.283 --> 26:22.044
- Who's Crowley?
- Oh, just eat, will you?

26:22.148 --> 26:23.425
You really should eat something.

26:23.529 --> 26:25.013
No, none of this is vegan.

26:25.116 --> 26:26.428
Oh, you're a vegan?

26:26.532 --> 26:27.912
Of course you're vegan.
I should've known.

26:28.016 --> 26:29.604
Look, I-I need something to eat.
Can I go to the store?

26:29.707 --> 26:31.226
No.
- Well...

26:31.330 --> 26:33.953
I need, like,
a KIND Bar, something.

26:36.127 --> 26:37.991
Listen, John, I will be

26:38.095 --> 26:40.373
very, very nice to Homm
and get him to talk,

26:40.477 --> 26:43.238
but I tell you now,
that and that...

26:43.342 --> 26:45.274
won't bring us to Crowley.

26:48.864 --> 26:50.590
Who the fuck is Crowley?

26:50.694 --> 26:52.937
Eat your eggs.

27:38.155 --> 27:40.295
Could I, uh, get my phone back?

27:40.399 --> 27:42.366
Uh, j-just to check my messages?

27:42.470 --> 27:44.299
Rather you didn't.

27:44.403 --> 27:46.163
Um, how about one of,
one of these?

27:46.266 --> 27:48.407
Would that be safer?

27:49.269 --> 27:51.306
Rather you didn't.

27:52.445 --> 27:54.378
You still don't trust me, huh?

27:54.482 --> 27:56.587
Just you...

27:56.691 --> 27:58.865
and the rest of the human race.

28:09.566 --> 28:11.740
So are you, like, a hacker?

28:11.844 --> 28:14.018
No, not really.

28:14.122 --> 28:15.641
I just need
to enter his password.

28:15.744 --> 28:17.125
The server will ask me
for a code,

28:17.228 --> 28:19.299
which will come up on the fob,
and once I'm in,

28:19.403 --> 28:22.786
I'll try and gather as much
communication data as possible.

28:22.889 --> 28:24.995
How do you know his password?

28:25.098 --> 28:27.066
I don't.

28:27.169 --> 28:29.413
But I got some ideas.

28:35.833 --> 28:37.835
Shit.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.809
What is so funny?

28:45.912 --> 28:47.396
We love numbers.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.985
<i>Games, ciphers.</i>

28:50.089 --> 28:51.849
Safety in numbers.

28:51.953 --> 28:54.611
His password's got to be
something like that.

28:54.714 --> 28:58.615
The Fibonacci sequence
was a favorite.

28:59.443 --> 29:00.651
Damn it.

29:00.755 --> 29:03.136
Second attempt failed.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.622
Three more,
and he's locked out for good.

29:05.725 --> 29:07.624
Run a trace on his location.

29:07.727 --> 29:09.936
I'll alert Xander.

29:12.042 --> 29:13.871
Uh, so this...

29:13.975 --> 29:15.494
Crowley guy,

29:15.597 --> 29:17.288
is he after you?

29:17.392 --> 29:19.705
- Or... you after him?
- Both.

29:27.989 --> 29:30.232
Can you get me
that egg timer back there?

29:30.336 --> 29:31.993
Thanks.

29:32.096 --> 29:34.133
Yeah.

29:39.690 --> 29:42.313
Your father, like, he...
he's like...

29:43.211 --> 29:45.731
Don't worry, you're not gonna
find a word to sum him up.

29:51.219 --> 29:53.428
Can I ask you something?

29:53.532 --> 29:56.017
What do you say
when-when people ask you

29:56.120 --> 29:57.743
about your childhood?

29:57.846 --> 29:59.710
Like-like, at a party
or whatever,

29:59.814 --> 30:01.401
what do you...
what-what do you say?

30:01.505 --> 30:04.059
I haven't been in that kind
of situation for a long time.

30:04.163 --> 30:06.648
Yeah, but it must come up, right?

30:06.752 --> 30:08.719
Are you the kind of person

30:08.823 --> 30:11.826
who tells the truth, or...

30:11.929 --> 30:14.483
do you make up something up?

30:15.830 --> 30:17.935
I mean, there's,
there's two ways to go.

30:18.039 --> 30:20.835
You either enjoy
laying it all out there

30:20.938 --> 30:23.078
making things awkward,
watching 'em squirm

30:23.182 --> 30:25.633
for bringing it up,

30:25.736 --> 30:28.256
or you avoid it
by making up something nice

30:28.359 --> 30:30.569
and moving on.

30:31.984 --> 30:34.573
I'm curious, which one are you?

30:38.266 --> 30:41.062
I used to tell people
that my dad was in the military

30:41.165 --> 30:44.134
and we traveled the world
together and it was magical.

30:44.962 --> 30:46.792
I guess I thought
it was better than saying

30:46.895 --> 30:50.381
that he turned me into
a distrustful, paranoid mess

30:50.485 --> 30:52.073
unfit for fatherhood

30:52.176 --> 30:54.869
and incapable of having
normal human relationships.

30:54.972 --> 30:56.802
Fuck me.

30:56.905 --> 30:58.735
Wow.

30:58.838 --> 31:01.530
Which one are you?

31:01.634 --> 31:03.602
Oh, I'm awkward all the way.

31:03.705 --> 31:05.396
Awkward, for sure.

31:07.882 --> 31:09.573
"What were your parents like?"

31:09.677 --> 31:12.438
And I just go all dead-faced,
I go,

31:12.541 --> 31:14.647
"I never have a dad.

31:14.751 --> 31:16.822
"I grew up in a car with my mom

31:16.925 --> 31:18.651
"until she died
when I was seven,

31:18.755 --> 31:21.792
but most of the foster homes
were nice."

31:21.896 --> 31:25.693
And they just absolutely
die inside.

31:25.796 --> 31:28.696
Like, like they want
to curl up in a ball.

31:28.799 --> 31:31.215
You got to make it awkward.

31:31.319 --> 31:33.770
It's the best, I'm telling you.

31:33.873 --> 31:35.944
Oh.

31:36.048 --> 31:37.946
And the rest?

31:38.982 --> 31:41.398
The rest?

31:41.501 --> 31:43.538
Oh, um...

31:43.642 --> 31:46.299
Well, I did
the whole bootstrap thing.

31:46.403 --> 31:47.818
Got myself into college.

31:47.922 --> 31:49.648
Worked my way
through law school.

31:49.751 --> 31:51.201
Got married too young.

31:51.304 --> 31:52.858
That did not work out.

31:52.961 --> 31:55.481
Ended up in Pittsburgh.

31:55.584 --> 31:57.794
Reinvented myself and...

31:57.897 --> 31:59.658
currently in hiding
with a fugitive

31:59.761 --> 32:01.832
and his fucked-up father.

32:01.936 --> 32:03.869
- That's about it.
- Wow.

32:03.972 --> 32:07.113
I can't tell whether I'm
supposed to apologize for asking

32:07.217 --> 32:10.807
or if you're telling me
the feelgood lie.

32:15.087 --> 32:17.883
Gas station up the street,
if you're still hungry.

32:18.711 --> 32:20.402
Yeah?

32:20.506 --> 32:22.232
You are gonna let me go there?

32:22.335 --> 32:24.234
Yeah, I can trust you that much.

32:24.337 --> 32:26.201
No phones. Cash only.

32:26.305 --> 32:27.962
Yeah?

32:28.963 --> 32:31.448
You think they're gonna have
a good vegan section?

32:34.658 --> 32:36.660
I doubt it.

32:38.455 --> 32:40.353
Better idea.

32:40.457 --> 32:42.390
An apple tree in the backyard.

32:42.493 --> 32:44.668
Yeah.

32:44.772 --> 32:46.981
That is a better idea.

33:12.247 --> 33:13.801
He's trying again.

33:13.904 --> 33:16.838
I knew he'd be back.

33:16.942 --> 33:19.392
Does he know that you know that?

33:19.496 --> 33:22.430
It's a safe bet.
How's the trace?

33:22.533 --> 33:24.846
Depends on how many layers
he's hiding behind.

33:24.950 --> 33:26.296
If it's one VPN, it's easy.

33:26.399 --> 33:27.953
If it's a cluster,
it'll take longer.

33:28.056 --> 33:30.472
The longer he's connected to it,
the closer we get.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.095
We'll find him.

33:32.198 --> 33:34.511
There's only so many ghost
addresses he can hide behind.

33:34.614 --> 33:36.478
Shouldn't be too long.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.446
Good.

33:41.207 --> 33:44.210
Sir, I can get a location
on Weir.

33:45.556 --> 33:47.766
Yes. Actionable.

33:49.112 --> 33:51.424
I have a team standing by.

33:53.150 --> 33:56.188
<i>I have a source deep
in the government, okay?</i>

33:56.291 --> 34:00.295
<i>A deep state guy, okay,
who calls himself Zaius...</i>

34:00.399 --> 34:02.642
All right, here we go.
<i>- I-I'm serious!</i>

34:02.746 --> 34:04.299
- Okay.
<i>- True story.</i>

34:04.403 --> 34:07.406
- Open up.
<i>- And Zaius swears up and down</i>

34:07.509 --> 34:09.753
<i>that this, um...</i>

34:09.857 --> 34:12.514
<i>that this-this
treasury investigator...</i>

34:12.618 --> 34:14.378
<i>What's his...? Homm, yeah.</i>

34:14.482 --> 34:16.035
- Look, you're famous.
<i>- Homm. He thinks</i>

34:16.139 --> 34:17.450
<i>Edward Homm was killed</i>

34:17.554 --> 34:21.213
<i>because he got too close
to something big.</i>

34:21.316 --> 34:24.009
I mean, it makes sense to me.

34:24.112 --> 34:26.252
Listen, the guy's nuttier
than squirrel shit,

34:26.356 --> 34:27.944
but millions
of people watch him.

34:28.047 --> 34:30.049
It's a strange fucking world,
isn't it?

34:30.153 --> 34:32.224
Hmm?

34:32.327 --> 34:34.329
Look.

34:34.433 --> 34:35.883
It's safe.

34:35.986 --> 34:37.436
<i>The man don't like Edward Homm.</i>

34:37.539 --> 34:39.818
<i>And if the man
don't like Edward Homm,</i>

34:39.921 --> 34:42.337
<i>you know what the man does?</i>

34:42.441 --> 34:44.408
Come on.

34:44.512 --> 34:46.134
You must be starving.

34:46.238 --> 34:49.103
<i>...the rich and powerful
of America...</i>

34:49.206 --> 34:50.829
Come on.

34:50.932 --> 34:53.141
It's either this
or the turkey bacon.

34:53.245 --> 34:56.662
<i>...powerful enemies
who are connected,</i>

34:56.765 --> 34:59.009
<i>who know people who would be</i>

34:59.113 --> 35:01.460
<i>very happy if he was
out of the picture.</i>

35:01.563 --> 35:03.980
<i>Why? Because he...</i>

35:04.083 --> 35:06.845
See, no one wants to hurt you.

35:06.948 --> 35:10.400
We just want to find out
why they wanted you dead.

35:10.503 --> 35:13.196
Nutjob Shaw's right.

35:13.299 --> 35:15.957
One of your investigations
touched a nerve.

35:16.061 --> 35:19.305
So why don't we start
from there, hmm?

35:23.482 --> 35:26.036
How many investigations
are you running?

35:26.140 --> 35:27.520
Hmm?

35:27.624 --> 35:30.454
Come on, Ed,
we're trying to help you here.

35:32.663 --> 35:34.803
Was it Crowley?

35:34.907 --> 35:37.530
Do you know that name?

35:37.634 --> 35:39.878
Crowley?

35:40.706 --> 35:43.226
Did you stumble on that name?

35:44.434 --> 35:47.575
Look, we saved your life, right?

35:47.678 --> 35:49.646
You know that.

35:49.749 --> 35:51.855
You found something.

35:51.959 --> 35:54.375
Big enough to make you a target.

35:55.203 --> 35:57.723
We both want the same thing,
you and us.

35:57.826 --> 36:00.105
So what's it gonna be?

36:00.208 --> 36:03.142
Are you gonna be all heroic
and difficult?

36:03.246 --> 36:06.939
Or are you gonna be sensible
and help us save the world?

36:25.475 --> 36:27.753
<i>You need to know
what you're getting into.</i>

36:27.856 --> 36:31.170
<i>This is not cops and robbers
or three-dimensional chess</i>

36:31.274 --> 36:33.586
<i>or any game you've ever played.</i>

36:33.690 --> 36:36.210
No one's ever succeeded
in toppling a democracy

36:36.313 --> 36:38.384
as big and strong as ours.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.697
There are too many
checks and balances.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.664
Too big, too rich.

36:42.768 --> 36:45.978
I mean, sure, Putin
has used Crowley to rat-fuck

36:46.082 --> 36:48.222
elections and hijack
Georgia and Belarus,

36:48.325 --> 36:50.465
and carve it up
for his billionaire buddies

36:50.569 --> 36:53.675
and take his 50%,
but that's a far cry

36:53.779 --> 36:57.610
from taking over a place like
the United States of America.

36:57.714 --> 37:00.234
Now, Putin's already got
more than he can handle,

37:00.337 --> 37:02.926
but Crowley smells
an opportunity.

37:04.169 --> 37:07.103
See, a country rife
with anger and division...

37:08.138 --> 37:10.623
...is a job already half done.

37:10.727 --> 37:12.591
So he's making a play.

37:12.694 --> 37:15.801
But to do that,
he needs to find a candidate

37:15.904 --> 37:17.837
and to run him.

37:17.941 --> 37:19.736
And that requires

37:19.839 --> 37:22.083
U.S.-based infrastructure.

37:22.187 --> 37:24.051
Financial and media,

37:24.154 --> 37:25.845
et cetera, et cetera.

37:25.949 --> 37:27.261
Is that how we find him?

37:27.364 --> 37:29.815
Oh, no, you don't find him.
He finds you.

37:29.918 --> 37:33.681
Now, this data intel business
that you've built,

37:33.784 --> 37:35.786
he'll be attracted to that.

37:35.890 --> 37:37.167
Arda?

37:37.271 --> 37:41.171
Yes, but you two
have to stage a breakup

37:41.275 --> 37:44.071
so John can come work
under the radar with me

37:44.174 --> 37:47.281
and...
you take the company public.

37:47.384 --> 37:50.008
And you make it known
that you can collect

37:50.111 --> 37:52.424
and process data for elections.

37:52.527 --> 37:56.290
And you can build psych profiles
of likely voters

37:56.393 --> 38:00.052
and design strategies
to exploit them.

38:00.156 --> 38:02.986
Now, it may take a bit,
but if word gets out

38:03.090 --> 38:05.023
that you've got
everything he needs

38:05.126 --> 38:08.578
and you're willing to work with
a less than reputable clientele

38:08.681 --> 38:12.823
and you're comfortable
operating in the grays,

38:12.927 --> 38:15.964
he'll come sniffing around,
I guarantee it.

38:16.068 --> 38:18.346
And we have two big advantages.

38:18.450 --> 38:21.211
He still thinks that I'm dead.

38:21.315 --> 38:24.594
And he doesn't know
that you're my son.

38:24.697 --> 38:28.770
Now, that prevents him
exploiting family

38:28.874 --> 38:31.808
as a tool of manipulation.

38:31.911 --> 38:33.810
Do you have any family?

38:33.913 --> 38:36.123
None that I give a shit about.

38:37.779 --> 38:39.954
John?

38:40.058 --> 38:41.956
No.

38:42.060 --> 38:44.614
Hmm. Well...

38:44.717 --> 38:46.754
Arda will be the bait.

38:46.857 --> 38:49.653
<i>"Sources report that

39:23.273 --> 39:24.688
Don't let it go to your head.

39:24.792 --> 39:26.069
Too late.

39:26.173 --> 39:28.485
I like being the bad guy.

39:29.486 --> 39:31.592
It really should've been me.

39:31.695 --> 39:33.628
This is better.

39:33.732 --> 39:36.804
Keeps you and Ben
farther away from the bait.

39:36.907 --> 39:39.565
You're right. You're right.

39:40.463 --> 39:43.431
So I guess all that's left to do
is cut contact.

39:44.674 --> 39:46.572
Might be a while.

39:47.815 --> 39:50.058
Yeah.

39:51.301 --> 39:54.580
Maybe we find a way
to talk under the radar?

39:56.720 --> 39:58.446
Maybe.

39:59.758 --> 40:01.725
Eyes and ears everywhere.

40:02.968 --> 40:04.935
I don't know.

40:05.039 --> 40:06.765
What?

40:06.868 --> 40:09.285
What are you worried about?

40:10.148 --> 40:12.771
Don't let the dirty work
get to you.

40:14.566 --> 40:16.533
I'd be more worried about you.

40:16.637 --> 40:18.604
Who the hell else
are you gonna talk to?

40:26.198 --> 40:28.407
You'll be okay, yeah?

40:30.513 --> 40:34.102
Well, I-I won't let myself
go down that hole again.

40:34.206 --> 40:36.622
That's not what I said.

40:36.726 --> 40:38.728
Yeah, I'll be okay.

40:43.422 --> 40:44.837
Why didn't you tell Ben about...

40:44.941 --> 40:47.461
I don't want him knowing
anything about my personal life.

40:47.564 --> 40:49.566
I just want to get Crowley.

41:32.851 --> 41:33.817
Fuck!

41:33.921 --> 41:35.647
Ha, fucker.

41:35.750 --> 41:37.027
How much longer?

41:37.131 --> 41:38.753
Not too long.

41:38.857 --> 41:41.273
We've definitely
narrowed down his location.

41:41.377 --> 41:44.242
- He is still in New York.
- Where?

42:01.535 --> 42:04.192
- How do you like them apples?
- Jesus!

42:06.264 --> 42:08.576
You scared me.

42:08.680 --> 42:10.992
Dad joke.
"How do you like them apples?"

42:11.096 --> 42:12.822
Oh.

42:12.925 --> 42:14.789
Yeah, yeah. Dad joke.

42:14.893 --> 42:16.204
Um...

42:16.308 --> 42:18.206
they're-they're actually, uh...

42:18.310 --> 42:19.794
delicious.

42:19.898 --> 42:21.451
I'm sure they are.

42:21.555 --> 42:23.833
They're a heritage breed.

42:23.936 --> 42:26.145
You can't get them
in the store now.

42:26.249 --> 42:28.838
I think it's because
they bruise very easily.

42:28.941 --> 42:30.909
Oh. Hmm.

42:31.012 --> 42:32.911
I, uh...

42:33.014 --> 42:34.982
hadn't, um, heard that.

42:35.085 --> 42:37.398
Yeah, bruising.

42:37.502 --> 42:40.332
It's a big problem.

42:40.436 --> 42:42.990
In the apple business, I mean.

42:49.928 --> 42:51.550
Don't be frightened.

42:51.654 --> 42:53.483
I've already said
I wasn't going to kill you.

42:53.587 --> 42:55.934
I'm, I'm a man of my word.

42:56.037 --> 42:57.763
Okay, it's just...

42:59.075 --> 43:00.559
Look...

43:00.663 --> 43:03.562
this whole spying around...

43:03.666 --> 43:06.462
<i>Impossible</i> thing is--

43:06.565 --> 43:08.671
- it's new to me, so I'm just...
- Mm.

43:08.774 --> 43:09.568
I think I'm...

43:09.672 --> 43:11.708
I think I'm confused.

43:11.812 --> 43:13.192
It... You know?

43:14.021 --> 43:16.782
I've worked hard
to patch things up with my son.

43:17.576 --> 43:19.406
So killing you would be a...

43:19.509 --> 43:21.546
definite obstacle to that.

43:21.649 --> 43:23.410
So you stop worrying.

43:24.272 --> 43:27.690
Yeah. Glad to hear that
my continued existence is...

43:27.793 --> 43:30.209
- Yeah.
- ...is, uh, so important to you.

43:30.313 --> 43:32.315
Mm. Mm.

43:33.178 --> 43:35.042
I was a psychologist.

43:35.145 --> 43:36.526
It was in the military,

43:36.630 --> 43:38.597
before I joined the Agency.

43:38.701 --> 43:39.667
You know?

43:39.771 --> 43:41.842
One of my first projects

43:41.945 --> 43:44.983
was to make a list
of all the tells of a liar.

43:45.086 --> 43:47.434
It was really interesting.

43:48.504 --> 43:50.713
- Okay. Okay.
- Mm.

43:51.783 --> 43:53.232
So?

43:53.992 --> 43:55.614
Well, so...

43:55.718 --> 43:58.790
Hailey from Pittsburgh
by way of Chicago,

43:58.893 --> 44:03.657
leading counsel
to the Homeless Aid Network...

44:04.692 --> 44:07.177
...I'm gonna ask you a question.

44:07.281 --> 44:08.800
Just one.

44:08.903 --> 44:12.976
All you have to do is look me in
the eye and give me an answer.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.806
What do you think?

44:16.428 --> 44:18.465
Why?

44:18.568 --> 44:20.501
Well, why not?

44:21.709 --> 44:22.572
Just one.

44:22.676 --> 44:25.023
Come on. That's all I need.

44:25.126 --> 44:27.922
Then we can go inside
and eat some apples.

44:29.441 --> 44:31.339
Um...

44:31.443 --> 44:34.066
Okay, sure.

44:36.448 --> 44:38.519
Are you who you say you are?

44:43.041 --> 44:44.387
Yes.

44:45.250 --> 44:47.839
I am who I say I am, yes.

44:49.806 --> 44:51.325
And who are you working for?

44:51.429 --> 44:53.465
Oh, s-sorry. That's two.

44:53.569 --> 44:57.124
Um, two questions.

44:57.227 --> 44:59.954
But who are you working for?

45:04.372 --> 45:07.410
The Homeless Aid Network.

45:11.207 --> 45:12.829
Good.

45:12.933 --> 45:14.141
I believe you.

45:16.005 --> 45:17.351
Easy. See?

45:17.455 --> 45:18.525
Relax.

45:18.628 --> 45:20.596
Lower your guard.

45:20.699 --> 45:23.426
And show me what's in your hand.

45:25.117 --> 45:26.498
Huh?

45:26.602 --> 45:28.396
Your hand.

45:28.500 --> 45:30.640
Show me.

45:41.789 --> 45:42.859
Hmm.

45:43.757 --> 45:45.413
I must be getting old.

45:45.517 --> 45:47.070
Seeing things.

45:48.071 --> 45:48.969
Hmm.

45:50.315 --> 45:51.592
Okay.

45:51.696 --> 45:54.181
Let's go and eat some apples.

46:08.816 --> 46:10.059
<i>Node 19,</i>

46:10.162 --> 46:11.578
Seoul, Korea,

46:11.681 --> 46:12.993
which takes us to...

46:22.174 --> 46:24.349
<i>You really think
this is gonna work?</i>

46:24.452 --> 46:26.524
- Yeah.
- How?

46:26.627 --> 46:29.250
Well, clue one is
these four numbers.

46:29.354 --> 46:32.081
So, most likely,
it's a combination of these.

46:32.184 --> 46:33.772
I've tried those.

46:33.876 --> 46:35.843
Safes use three numbers,
not five.

46:35.947 --> 46:37.742
I've tried the f-first three,
the last three

46:37.845 --> 46:39.467
and any other combination
of three.

46:39.571 --> 46:40.883
It doesn't work.

46:41.884 --> 46:42.885
Well...

46:43.713 --> 46:44.645
Watch this.

46:44.749 --> 46:46.474
Clue two is all the letters.

46:46.578 --> 46:48.476
That means it's alphanumeric.

46:48.580 --> 46:50.237
It's the oldest kind of cipher.

46:50.340 --> 46:54.379
Basically, it'd be a number
for each letter in the alphabet.

46:54.482 --> 46:56.484
Say we do that.

46:59.522 --> 47:01.766
That's what I think it is.

47:02.560 --> 47:04.251
But that doesn't change anything.

47:04.354 --> 47:06.667
It's just the same four numbers
in a different order.

47:06.771 --> 47:10.568
Yeah, but break that sequence
into three parts.

47:11.327 --> 47:12.949
Look.

47:13.053 --> 47:14.572
Like this.

47:17.126 --> 47:20.094
There's only one way
it would work on that dial.

47:20.198 --> 47:22.165
Well, can you do it?

47:23.511 --> 47:24.858
Let's see.

47:39.631 --> 47:41.253
Holy shit, you did it!

47:43.462 --> 47:44.498
- Oh, my God, you did it!
- I did it.

47:44.602 --> 47:45.499
You did it!

47:57.269 --> 47:58.616
Okay, time's up.

47:58.719 --> 48:00.721
I know what I'm doing.
I've still got time.

48:01.757 --> 48:03.275
Dutchess County.

48:03.379 --> 48:04.829
Just north of the city.

48:04.932 --> 48:05.899
They're pretty close.

48:06.002 --> 48:07.763
All right, scramble the team.

48:07.866 --> 48:10.006
Update them as more come in.

48:10.110 --> 48:11.042
Enough.

48:11.145 --> 48:12.560
No Internet after 15 minutes.

48:12.664 --> 48:13.872
You're breaking your own rule.

48:13.976 --> 48:15.736
I'm telling you,
I've still got time.

48:17.738 --> 48:19.809
Time's up.
You're going to expose us.

48:19.913 --> 48:21.915
Just let me do this.

48:24.296 --> 48:25.850
Shit. He's rerouting again.

48:25.953 --> 48:27.403
I'm on it.

48:27.506 --> 48:29.957
Taking it back through node 12.

48:30.061 --> 48:31.614
Got it.

48:31.718 --> 48:33.133
He's actually south
of Dutchess County.

48:33.236 --> 48:36.274
That's what I thought.

48:36.377 --> 48:38.103
Uh, okay, okay.

48:38.207 --> 48:39.795
Hey, hey, hey.

48:39.898 --> 48:43.522
Don't do anything until you have
his exact location.

48:43.626 --> 48:46.008
You got it? Be right back.

48:56.743 --> 48:59.193
Do it. Now.
What are you waiting for?

49:10.342 --> 49:11.792
Shit.

49:16.417 --> 49:17.729
I'm in. I'm in.

49:19.351 --> 49:21.043
He's in.

49:22.320 --> 49:23.562
Almost have him.

49:26.393 --> 49:28.567
Ossining, I think.

49:28.671 --> 49:30.121
Waiting on the exact address.

49:30.224 --> 49:32.468
- I'll tell the team.
- He's in the messaging server.

49:32.571 --> 49:33.814
D-Do we cut him off?

49:33.918 --> 49:35.091
He said not to.

49:35.195 --> 49:36.783
But he doesn't know
that he's in.

49:36.886 --> 49:38.232
Well, where the fuck is he?

49:38.336 --> 49:39.958
XANDER [clears throat]:
Special Agent Madi?

49:40.062 --> 49:40.890
Yes.

49:40.994 --> 49:42.996
- Hi.
- Xander Arnaz.

49:43.099 --> 49:46.033
So, I understand
you're running things for now?

49:46.137 --> 49:47.828
Until the board
votes on a new CEO,

49:47.932 --> 49:50.244
which should be soon, yes.

49:50.348 --> 49:52.937
But, frankly, this is
not an opportune time for me.

49:53.040 --> 49:54.628
- So perhaps we can...
- Oh, boy.

49:54.732 --> 49:56.492
Perhaps we can what?

49:56.595 --> 49:57.769
Reschedule.

49:57.873 --> 49:59.460
Are you kidding me?

49:59.564 --> 50:01.117
As you know,

50:01.221 --> 50:03.602
our legal team has fully
cooperated with law enforcement

50:03.706 --> 50:05.259
on the issue
of Mr. Valence's death.

50:05.363 --> 50:06.709
Uh, yeah, but...

50:06.813 --> 50:08.918
I'm here
to talk about John Weir.

50:09.747 --> 50:11.196
John Weir?

50:11.990 --> 50:13.751
Is this a joke to you, okay?

50:13.854 --> 50:15.994
Why are you messing
with me right now?

50:16.098 --> 50:18.479
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

50:18.583 --> 50:20.136
Yes, you are confused.

50:20.240 --> 50:22.414
Because I kicked my teenage
daughter out of the bathroom

50:22.518 --> 50:24.002
so I could rush my ass down here

50:24.106 --> 50:26.729
because your email said
it was urgent

50:26.833 --> 50:28.489
we talk at 10:15
about John Weir.

50:28.593 --> 50:30.940
Well, I did not send you
any email.

50:31.044 --> 50:32.010
I...

50:36.187 --> 50:39.052
I'm sorry. We're gonna have
to, uh, pick this up later.

50:39.155 --> 50:41.640
No, no, no.
We got to talk about this.

50:41.744 --> 50:44.712
Hey. Where are you going?

50:45.506 --> 50:47.129
I'm not leaving!

50:48.682 --> 50:50.063
He's downloading comm data!

50:50.166 --> 50:52.479
What? Why are you...
why are you letting him do that?

50:52.582 --> 50:54.205
- You said not...
- Cut him off!

50:54.308 --> 50:56.103
Cut him off!

50:56.207 --> 50:57.139
Fuck!

50:57.242 --> 50:59.037
Okay, got it.

50:59.141 --> 51:01.039
Tell everyone
we're leaving in five.

51:01.143 --> 51:02.351
Okay.

51:31.414 --> 51:33.692
<i>What are you
waiting for? Open it.</i>

52:05.863 --> 52:07.278
What is all this?

52:28.989 --> 52:30.404
What is it?

52:30.508 --> 52:32.061
It's just a bunch of numbers
and bullshit.

52:32.165 --> 52:33.856
This part looks like math.

52:36.721 --> 52:39.034
"The Algorithms of Control:

52:39.137 --> 52:40.828
"Cognitive Data Formulae

52:40.932 --> 52:43.762
to Predict and Manipulate
Human Behavior."

52:44.660 --> 52:46.041
Whatever that means.

52:46.144 --> 52:48.767
I don't know what I thought
I'd find in there.

52:49.596 --> 52:51.046
I was being stupid.

52:51.149 --> 52:52.185
There's still more.

52:52.288 --> 52:54.290
Like I said, it's just crap.

52:54.394 --> 52:55.878
There's literally nothing here.

52:55.982 --> 52:57.052
- Well, hang on.
- No.

52:57.155 --> 52:59.054
He didn't give a shit about me.

52:59.157 --> 53:01.573
He didn't care. This is
all that mattered to him.

53:02.781 --> 53:04.197
That's not true.

53:04.300 --> 53:06.371
It's bullshit!
How would you know?!

53:06.475 --> 53:07.510
Because I do.

53:07.614 --> 53:10.444
That's how I figured out
the cipher.

53:11.894 --> 53:13.068
Look.

53:14.897 --> 53:16.830
The numbers were always there.

53:16.934 --> 53:18.694
They just needed
to be put in order.

53:18.797 --> 53:20.558
People don't use random numbers

53:20.661 --> 53:22.249
for things
that they want to remember.

53:22.353 --> 53:24.631
They use something that
they'll easily remember.

53:24.734 --> 53:28.255
They use something
that means something to them.

53:28.359 --> 53:31.017
Something that they care about.

53:31.810 --> 53:34.882
These numbers represent letters,

53:34.986 --> 53:38.093
and they spell one thing
worth remembering.

53:41.717 --> 53:44.133
Safety in numbers.

53:46.411 --> 53:48.241
It's me.

53:50.312 --> 53:51.969
It's me.

53:58.699 --> 54:00.701
If you ever say
"safety in numbers" again,

54:00.805 --> 54:02.669
I'm going to punch you.

54:07.846 --> 54:09.365
Okay.

54:10.677 --> 54:12.506
Watch your head.

54:12.610 --> 54:14.370
There.

54:36.565 --> 54:37.945
Sir.

54:38.049 --> 54:39.878
I'm so sorry. Um...

54:40.672 --> 54:43.537
Uh, the plan didn't go
as we'd hoped, sir.

54:47.472 --> 54:49.095
Yes, sir.

55:00.244 --> 55:02.073
<i>...for a complicated world.</i>

55:02.177 --> 55:03.454
<i>Arda Data Solutions...</i>

55:03.557 --> 55:06.077
Okay, look,
I just need two minutes.

55:06.181 --> 55:07.389
That's it.

55:07.492 --> 55:09.149
- Come on, man.
- I'm sorry.

55:09.253 --> 55:10.944
We'll be happy to have
our attorneys contact you

55:11.048 --> 55:13.119
as soon as possible.

55:13.222 --> 55:14.189
<i>Rasche.</i>

55:14.292 --> 55:15.776
Rasche, no, listen to me.

55:15.880 --> 55:17.433
I didn't self-motivate.

55:17.537 --> 55:20.126
They reached out to me, okay?
Or Weir did.

55:20.229 --> 55:23.232
Well, I don't know. Maybe they
want someone looking into Arda.

55:23.336 --> 55:24.820
But it doesn't matter.

55:24.923 --> 55:27.719
There is definitely
something bigger going on here.

55:27.823 --> 55:29.411
How do I know?

55:29.514 --> 55:30.860
How do I... Oh!

55:37.867 --> 55:39.904
Call it a feeling.
