37:40.626 --> 37:41.714
BOY 1: Ethan.

37:41.715 --> 37:43.619
(CHANTING) London bridge
is falling down...

37:43.620 --> 37:44.721
(CHILD LAUGHING)

37:44.722 --> 37:45.986
BOY 2: Ethan.

37:46.011 --> 37:48.516
(CHANTING) London bridge
is falling down...

37:50.868 --> 37:51.870
(VOICES FADE)

37:53.645 --> 37:55.315
The creatures of the night.

37:56.380 --> 37:57.950
What music they make.

37:58.684 --> 38:00.789
Do you like it, Mr. Chandler?

38:00.968 --> 38:03.607
You are at one with the
night, are you not?

38:03.701 --> 38:06.407
- Where is she?
- She is happy.

38:06.634 --> 38:09.273
If you truly love her, that
ought to be enough for you.

38:09.273 --> 38:11.412
Tell me where she is or I'll
put a bullet through you.

38:14.351 --> 38:15.519
(CHOKING)

38:15.520 --> 38:18.812
You do love her. I can see it in you.

38:19.411 --> 38:22.351
That, sir, is your tragedy, not hers.

38:24.272 --> 38:25.274
(CHOKING)

38:28.715 --> 38:29.717
(COUGHS)

38:31.420 --> 38:33.397
As long as I have life in me,

38:33.615 --> 38:35.519
she will never be your prisoner.

38:36.151 --> 38:37.755
DR. SWEET: How little you think of her.

38:38.729 --> 38:40.366
She is no one's captive.

38:41.491 --> 38:44.715
I am simply the man who stands
gratefully at her side.

38:45.915 --> 38:48.888
- I will save her.
- She is saved.

38:54.136 --> 38:56.840
While you were in America
wrestling with your demons,

38:56.841 --> 38:58.645
she freed herself of hers.

38:59.948 --> 39:01.784
She has made her choice.

39:01.785 --> 39:03.355
Leave her in peace.

39:04.725 --> 39:07.563
I understand very little
of the forces of my life.

39:08.065 --> 39:10.169
Those things that have shaped me,

39:10.170 --> 39:11.371
and cursed me.

39:11.372 --> 39:14.945
But I know that my destiny
is joined with hers.

39:14.946 --> 39:16.383
I will not stop.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.291
I suppose I can't blame you.

39:20.993 --> 39:23.396
I would feel the same.

39:23.397 --> 39:26.035
After all, without her,

39:26.036 --> 39:28.074
what do we have left, Ethan?

39:28.074 --> 39:29.076
(GRUNTS)

39:38.233 --> 39:41.336
His name is Renfield.
He was my secretary.

39:41.336 --> 39:45.343
He said that Vanessa was with the Master.
This is the creature she called Dracula.

39:45.344 --> 39:47.247
I've got to get him to
tell us where she is.

39:47.248 --> 39:49.286
And how do you intend to
discover this information?

39:49.286 --> 39:52.192
I intend to reach into
his mind and rip it out.

39:54.664 --> 39:55.765
Is he restrained?

39:55.766 --> 39:59.073
- Yes, Doctor. He was biting, so I...
- Yes, yes, I know. Unlock it.

39:59.074 --> 40:00.776
(KEYS RATTLING)

40:09.562 --> 40:12.134
Good evening, Doctor.

40:13.771 --> 40:16.199
You've brought friends. (CHUCKLES)

40:16.306 --> 40:18.408
Shall they be my friends as well?

40:18.433 --> 40:19.868
Turn around, Mr. Renfield.

40:23.206 --> 40:25.442
Are you going to beat me, sir?

40:25.442 --> 40:27.911
- Would you like me to?
- Oh, very droll.

40:27.911 --> 40:30.647
But I've had more than
enough of that for one day,

40:30.648 --> 40:32.115
thank you kindly.

40:35.018 --> 40:36.286
Now, you...

40:38.461 --> 40:40.396
you're more my thing.

40:44.098 --> 40:46.890
Oh, you have no idea.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.576
Shall we play, you and I?

40:49.601 --> 40:52.502
- I like games.
- And if I win?

40:53.367 --> 40:55.236
You won't, little man.

40:57.774 --> 40:59.609
(SOFTLY) Don't I scare you?

41:02.212 --> 41:03.146
(METAL CLANKS)

41:04.449 --> 41:07.664
I whistle away haunts like
you before breakfast, love.

41:07.689 --> 41:08.226
(GASPS)

41:08.251 --> 41:09.386

41:10.891 --> 41:13.894
