11:15.592 --> 11:17.135
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.135
IT IS.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.638
THERE'S A REASON HE'S

11:17.177 --> 11:19.638
DRAGGING YOU OUT THERE.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.680
HE'S MANIPULATING YOU.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.680
HE'S A MASTER AT IT.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.433
OKAY, FINE.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.433
MAYBE HE IS.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.977
BUT HE REALLY WANTS ME TO GO.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.977
I CAN TELL.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.521
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.022
I MEAN, HE INVITED YOU,

11:29.063 --> 11:31.065
AND I'D REALLY LOVE IT

11:29.063 --> 11:31.065
IF YOU'D COME,

11:31.107 --> 11:32.900
BUT REALLY,

11:31.107 --> 11:32.900
YOU CAN STAY HOME.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.944
DON'T MAKE

11:32.942 --> 11:34.944
A BIG THING OUT OF THIS.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.863
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO

11:34.986 --> 11:36.863
BE A FIGHT.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.490
WE GO.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.490
HI, YALE. BYE, YALE.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.033
NO HARM. NO FOUL.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.619
HOW MANY MORE TWO-WORD SENTENCES

11:40.074 --> 11:42.619
CAN YOU COME UP WITH?

11:42.661 --> 11:44.663
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

11:42.661 --> 11:44.663
A TOTAL LOSS.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.956
LOOK HOW SHE'S LEADING ME

11:44.703 --> 11:46.956
BACK TO THE CAR.

11:46.998 --> 11:50.043
I'M SURE YOU AND I CAN

11:46.998 --> 11:50.043
FIGURE OUT FUN THINGS TO DO

11:50.084 --> 11:51.336
WHILE THEY'RE OFF

11:50.084 --> 11:51.336
AT DINNER --

11:51.378 --> 11:52.671
SOME COOL

11:51.378 --> 11:52.671
ROAD-TRIP THING.

11:52.711 --> 11:54.172
IN NEW HAVEN?

11:52.711 --> 11:54.172
WELL, YEAH.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.965
HAVE YOU EVER

11:54.214 --> 11:55.965
BEEN TO NEW HAVEN?

11:56.007 --> 11:57.384
NO.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.678
LOOK AT THE COFFEE POT

11:57.425 --> 11:59.678
BEFORE I CLEAN IT.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.720
THAT'S NEW HAVEN.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.720
WE CAN MAKE IT FUN.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.515
IT'D MEAN A LOT

12:01.762 --> 12:03.515
TO THE GRANDPARENTS.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.058
EVERYBODY WINS.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.058
RORY, LISTEN TO ME...

12:05.099 --> 12:06.809
I KNOW.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.809
I AM BEING MANIPULATED.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.896
THIS IS PART OF GRANDPA'S EVIL

12:06.851 --> 12:09.896
PLAN TO TAKE OVER MY LIFE,

12:09.937 --> 12:12.440
ABOLISH MY FREE WILL,

12:09.937 --> 12:12.440
PULL ME INTO THE GILMORE WORLD,

12:12.482 --> 12:14.484
DRESS ME IN PEARLS,

12:12.482 --> 12:14.484
AND RUIN MY LIFE.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.777
DID I LEAVE ANYTHING OUT?

12:14.526 --> 12:16.777
HMM, LET ME SEE...

12:16.819 --> 12:19.030
MANIPULATE, EVIL PLAN,

12:16.819 --> 12:19.030
NO FREE WILL, PEARLS.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.823
NO, I THINK

12:19.072 --> 12:20.823
YOU'VE ABOUT COVERED IT.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.368
OH, WAIT -- DID YOU CALL

12:20.865 --> 12:23.368
MY FATHER THE "PUPPET MASTER"?

12:23.410 --> 12:24.661
NO, I DID NOT.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.204
ALWAYS CALL HIM

12:24.703 --> 12:26.204
THE PUPPET MASTER.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.289
I WILL NEVER MAKE

12:26.246 --> 12:28.289
THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.167
LUKE, WHERE'S YOUR

12:30.124 --> 12:31.167
LOST AND FOUND?

12:31.209 --> 12:33.670
OUT BACK

12:31.209 --> 12:33.670
IN THE DUMPSTER.

12:33.712 --> 12:34.921
I NEED YOUR HELP.

12:33.712 --> 12:34.921
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.464
I'M SHAKING LIKE

12:34.962 --> 12:36.464
A SPASTIC COLON.

12:36.506 --> 12:37.798
WHAT'S THE MATTER,

12:36.506 --> 12:37.798
KIRK?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.343
MY TROPHY'S GONE.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.343
SOMEONE TOOK HER.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.511
THE LAST TIME

12:40.385 --> 12:41.511
I REMEMBER SEEING HER

12:41.553 --> 12:42.761
SHE WAS NEXT TO ME

12:41.553 --> 12:42.761
AT THE MOVIES.

12:42.803 --> 12:43.971
STOP CALLING IT "SHE."

12:44.013 --> 12:46.683
I'VE RETRACED MY STEPS

12:44.013 --> 12:46.683
ALL DAY AND NOTHING.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.644
I SUSPECT FOUL PLAY.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.644
KIDNAPPING POSSIBLY.

12:49.686 --> 12:50.687
I THINK YOU SHOULD

12:49.686 --> 12:50.687
GO TO THE POLICE,

12:50.729 --> 12:52.105
AND IF THEY

12:50.729 --> 12:52.105
MENTION SOMETHING

12:52.146 --> 12:53.398
ABOUT STAYING SOMEWHERE

12:52.146 --> 12:53.398
FOR OBSERVATION,

12:53.440 --> 12:54.941
IT'S JUST ROUTINE.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.277
HEY, KIRK.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.319
RORY.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.738
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:59.778 --> 13:02.031
WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING

12:59.778 --> 13:02.031
AT ABOUT 10:00?

13:02.073 --> 13:03.824
AT SCHOOL.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.824
DO YOU HAVE

13:02.073 --> 13:03.824
ANY WITNESSES?

13:03.866 --> 13:05.619
YES.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.619
CAN YOU GET A SHORT STATEMENT?

13:05.660 --> 13:06.827
NO.

13:05.660 --> 13:06.827
OH. WELL. OKAY.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.332
SOMEONE TOOK

13:10.081 --> 13:11.332
HIS STATUE AGAIN.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.042
YEP.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.042
EVERY YEAR.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.587
THERE'S SOME THINGS

13:13.084 --> 13:15.587
IN LIFE THAT NEVER LET YOU DOWN.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.131
SO, IT'S NICE

13:15.629 --> 13:18.131
TO SEE YOU, RORY.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.675
IT'S NICE TO SEE

13:18.172 --> 13:20.675
YOU TOO, LUKE.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.219
SO, TABLE FOR ONE?

13:20.717 --> 13:23.219
I'LL JUST SIT

13:20.717 --> 13:23.219
AT THE COUNTER.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.763
OKAY.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.763
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

13:24.803 --> 13:26.805
UM, I GUESS I'LL HAVE

13:24.803 --> 13:26.805
A CHEESEBURGER.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.397
HEY, JESS, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.397
RORY.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.274
HI.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.068
TIME TO ADD ANOTHER WORD.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.068
JESS, YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?

13:39.110 --> 13:41.195
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.195
YEAH,

13:39.110 --> 13:41.195
I'M NOT HUNGRY EITHER.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.863
WHAT ABOUT THE BURGER?

13:42.905 --> 13:45.742
WELL, COULD YOU WRAP IT UP?

13:42.905 --> 13:45.742
I'M GONNA EAT IT LATER.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.285
I ACTUALLY PREFER BURGERS

13:47.327 --> 13:49.329
AFTER THEY'VE BEEN

13:47.327 --> 13:49.329
SITTING AROUND FOR A WHILE.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.371
LETS THEM AGE.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.706
OKAY.

13:54.793 --> 13:57.337
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT

13:54.793 --> 13:57.337
THAT BOOK UPSTAIRS.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.506
OH.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.506
THE BOOK WE TALKED ABOUT.

13:59.547 --> 14:00.881
YEP.

13:59.547 --> 14:00.881
GREAT.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.634
WE COULD GO

14:00.923 --> 14:02.634
LOOK AT IT.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.051
LOOK AT THE BOOK.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.051
SURE.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.095
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS

14:04.093 --> 14:06.095
AND LOOK AT THE BOOK.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.681
OKAY.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.574
SO, HERE WE ARE.

14:26.616 --> 14:27.784
YEP. HERE WE ARE.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.706
WOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT

14:30.203 --> 14:32.706
SINCE YOU GUYS REDID IT.

14:32.747 --> 14:33.873
OH, YEAH.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.583
IT'S BIGGER.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.586
RIPPING A WALL DOWN

14:35.625 --> 14:38.586
CAN HAVE THAT EFFECT ON A ROOM.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.338
YEAH.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.131
THAT PART OVER THERE...

14:40.380 --> 14:42.131
THAT'S MINE.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.883
YOUR...

14:42.173 --> 14:43.883
YEAH.

14:43.924 --> 14:44.925
YOU WANT A SODA?

14:44.967 --> 14:47.136
NO, I'M FINE.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.346
OKAY.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.767
SURE YOU DON'T WANT

14:51.265 --> 14:52.767
A SODA?

14:52.809 --> 14:54.227
YEAH, I'M SURE.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.105
PLEASE LET ME GET YOU A SODA.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.650
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING OTHER THAN

14:58.147 --> 15:00.650
STANDING LIKE A MORON.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.737
TAKE COMFORT IN THE FACT THAT

15:00.692 --> 15:03.737
YOU ARE NOT DOING IT ALONE.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.530
OKAY.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.530
LET'S JUST REGROUP HERE.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.323
YEAH. REGROUP.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.577
FIRST, WE SHOULD TRY AND GET

15:07.365 --> 15:10.577
WITHIN A FOOT OF EACH OTHER.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.786
OKAY.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.208
I THINK THAT'S ABOUT A FOOT.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.503
HUH. THAT SCHOOL OF YOURS

15:17.250 --> 15:20.503
IS REALLY PAYING OFF.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.255
SO NOW WHAT?

15:22.296 --> 15:24.424
NOW WE SHOULD...

15:24.465 --> 15:26.967
I THINK WE EITHER NEED

15:24.465 --> 15:26.967
TO GET A LITTLE CLOSER

15:27.009 --> 15:28.636
OR NEED TO WARM UP.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.846
OKAY.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.604
HI.

15:37.645 --> 15:38.855
HI.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.151
OH, I GOT THE BURGER.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.195
THANK YOU.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.195
I ALSO THREW IN

15:44.193 --> 15:46.195
SOME FRIES.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.530
FRIES. GREAT.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.530
I LOVE FRIES.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.950
OKAY, UM, JESS,

15:47.572 --> 15:50.950
THANK YOU FOR, UM...

15:50.991 --> 15:52.076
UM...

15:52.118 --> 15:53.536
I GOTTA GO.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.708
WHAT WAS GOING ON UP HERE?

15:58.750 --> 16:00.126
NOTHING.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.126
NOTHING?

16:00.167 --> 16:02.420
I WALK IN AND YOU TWO

16:00.167 --> 16:02.420
ARE LIKE SHRAPNEL.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.838
YOUR TIMING'S PERFECT.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.132
NEXT TIME I'LL HANG

16:03.880 --> 16:06.132
A SOCK ON THE DOOR.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.342
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.342
DO YOU HEAR ME?

16:08.384 --> 16:09.803
RELAX. I WAS KIDDING.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.305
REALLY?

16:09.844 --> 16:12.305
THAT'S YOUR IDEA OF FUNNY?

16:12.346 --> 16:14.682
DEPENDING ON THE SOCK DESIGN

16:12.346 --> 16:14.682
IT COULD BE HILARIOUS.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.225
THAT'S IT. SIT DOWN.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.225
WHY?

16:16.267 --> 16:18.728
IT'S TIME TO LAY DOWN

16:16.267 --> 16:18.728
A FEW GROUND RULES. SIT.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.816
ALRIGHT, FIRST OFF,

16:22.857 --> 16:25.276
WHEN SHE IS UP HERE,

16:22.857 --> 16:25.276
THAT DOOR STAYS OPEN.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.945
EXCUSE ME?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.489
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED ON EITHER

16:26.986 --> 16:29.489
END OF THIS APARTMENT.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.283
YOU'RE TO REMAIN HERE IN

16:29.530 --> 16:32.283
THE MIDDLE PORTION OF THE ROOM.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.828
YOU MAY SIT ON THE COUCH

16:32.325 --> 16:34.828
OR ON THE CHAIR

16:34.869 --> 16:37.371
AS LONG AS YOU TWO ARE SITTING

16:34.869 --> 16:37.371
ON SEPARATE SEATS --

16:37.413 --> 16:39.916
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE COUCH,

16:37.413 --> 16:39.916
THEN SHE'S ON THE CHAIR.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.960
SHE'S ON THE COUCH,

16:39.958 --> 16:41.960
YOU'RE ON THE CHAIR.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.461
I GET IT. THANK YOU.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.088
ON WEEKDAYS, YOU WILL

16:43.503 --> 16:46.088
HAVE HER HOME BY 9:00.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.633
ON WEEKENDS, YOU WILL

16:46.130 --> 16:48.633
HAVE HER HOME BY 11:00.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.343
ANY EVIDENCE OF ALCOHOL,

16:48.675 --> 16:50.343
CIGARETTE SMOKE,

16:50.384 --> 16:53.346
OR ANYTHING THAT NANCY REAGAN

16:50.384 --> 16:53.346
WOULD FIND UNACCEPTABLE,

16:53.387 --> 16:56.432
AND YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED NEAR

16:53.387 --> 16:56.432
HER WITHOUT AN ADULT PRESENT.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.684
ARE THESE RULES CLEAR?

16:57.725 --> 16:59.268
YES. MAY I SPEAK?

16:57.725 --> 16:59.268
GOOD.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.603
IF YOU MUST.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.647
DO YOU WANT ME

17:00.645 --> 17:02.647
TO HAVE YOU COMMITTED

17:02.689 --> 17:04.315
OR WOULD YOU

17:02.689 --> 17:04.315
CHECK YOURSELF IN?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.442
I'M NOT JOKING HERE,

17:04.357 --> 17:06.442
MISTER.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.486
YOU KNOW YOU'RE MY GUARDIAN,

17:06.484 --> 17:08.486
NOT HERS.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.237
YOU DON'T NEED

27:09.503 --> 27:11.505
I CAN TAKE IT.

27:11.547 --> 27:12.714
[ SIGHS ]

27:15.759 --> 27:17.052
WOW!

27:15.759 --> 27:17.052
LIONS AND TIGERS

27:15.759 --> 27:17.052
AND BEARS...

27:17.094 --> 27:18.929
OH, MY.

27:17.094 --> 27:18.929
IMPRESSIVE,

27:17.094 --> 27:18.929
ISN'T IT?

27:18.971 --> 27:20.722
I'D LIKE TO OPEN

27:18.971 --> 27:20.722
A CHECKING ACCOUNT.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.182
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

27:22.224 --> 27:23.976
THIS IS THE MAIN

27:22.224 --> 27:23.976
ADMINISTRATION BUILDING --

27:24.017 --> 27:25.685
PROFESSORS' OFFICES,

27:24.017 --> 27:25.685
THE DEAN'S OFFICE.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.729
SOME OF THE BEST SCOTCH

27:25.727 --> 27:27.729
IN THE COUNTRY

27:27.771 --> 27:29.273
CAN BE FOUND

27:27.771 --> 27:29.273
BEHIND THOSE DOORS.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.317
I'M NOT SURE

27:29.315 --> 27:31.317
HOW TO TAKE THAT, DAD.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.444
COME ON.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.444
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE.

27:33.486 --> 27:34.736
WHAT'S HE SO

27:33.486 --> 27:34.736
EXCITED ABOUT?

27:34.778 --> 27:36.447
OH, WHO KNOWS?

27:36.489 --> 27:38.991
DICKENS MUST HAVE DROPPED

27:36.489 --> 27:38.991
A PENCIL HERE AT SOME POINT.

27:39.032 --> 27:42.453
RORY, THIS IS THE OFFICE

27:39.032 --> 27:42.453
OF A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.163
HIS NAME IS HARRIS FELLOWS,

27:44.204 --> 27:46.706
AND HE JUST HAPPENS TO BE

27:44.204 --> 27:46.706
THE DEAN OF ADMISSIONS.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.083
REALLY?

27:46.748 --> 27:48.083
THAT'S RIGHT.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.627
I CALLED HIM BEFORE

27:48.125 --> 27:49.627
WE CAME,

27:49.667 --> 27:52.171
ASKED HIM IF HE HAD

27:49.667 --> 27:52.171
TIME TO SQUEEZE YOU IN,

27:52.212 --> 27:53.380
AND HE SAID YES.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.215
SQUEEZE ME IN...

27:53.422 --> 27:55.215
FOR AN INTERVIEW.

27:55.257 --> 27:56.467
AN INTERVIEW

27:55.257 --> 27:56.467
FOR WHAT?

27:56.509 --> 27:58.260
FOR YALE.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.260
GRANDPA...

27:58.302 --> 28:00.429
I TOLD HIM ABOUT

27:58.302 --> 28:00.429
YOU AND YOUR GRADES

28:00.471 --> 28:01.972
AND HOW YOU'RE DOING

28:00.471 --> 28:01.972
AT CHILTON.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.265
HE INSISTED

28:02.014 --> 28:03.265
ON SEEING YOU.

28:03.307 --> 28:05.058
HE WOULDN'T

28:03.307 --> 28:05.058
LET ME OFF THE HOOK.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.768
I HAVEN'T APPLIED

28:05.100 --> 28:06.768
TO YALE.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.979
I TOLD HIM THAT YOU WEREN'T

28:06.810 --> 28:08.979
FINISHED DECIDING --

28:09.021 --> 28:10.648
THAT YOU WERE BEING

28:09.021 --> 28:10.648
VERY PICKY.

28:10.688 --> 28:12.941
I THINK THAT MADE HIM

28:10.688 --> 28:12.941
WANT YOU EVEN MORE.

28:12.983 --> 28:15.235
THEY CAN BE VERY COMPETITIVE,

28:12.983 --> 28:15.235
THESE IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS.

28:15.277 --> 28:18.989
HE'S EXPECTING YOU AT 3:00.

28:15.277 --> 28:18.989
OH, LOOK -- IT'S 3:00 NOW.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.200
WELL, WE TIMED THIS PERFECTLY,

28:19.031 --> 28:21.200
DIDN'T WE?

28:21.241 --> 28:23.536
I'LL WALK YOU IN.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.536
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

28:23.577 --> 28:25.829
RORY, HONEY,

28:23.577 --> 28:25.829
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO IN THERE.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.374
WHAT? WELL, OF COURSE

28:25.871 --> 28:28.374
SHE'S GOING TO GO IN THERE.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.417
RORY, HONEY -- THE ONLY PERSON

28:28.415 --> 28:30.417
I'M TALKING TO --

28:30.459 --> 28:32.378
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO IN THERE.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.753
LORELAI, THE MAN IS WAITING.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.422
YOU WANNA LEAVE?

28:33.795 --> 28:35.422
WE CAN.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.299
NO, IT'S OKAY.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.299
I'LL GO IN.

28:37.341 --> 28:39.552
HARRIS IS A VERY NICE MAN,

28:37.341 --> 28:39.552
RORY.

28:39.593 --> 28:41.554
YOU TWO ARE GONNA HIT IT OFF.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.263
COME ON, I'LL WALK YOU IN.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.571
MY SKIRT SEEMS TO BE

28:56.151 --> 28:58.571
HOLDING UP VERY WELL.

29:01.490 --> 29:02.658
LORELAI --

29:01.490 --> 29:02.658
NO. MNH-MNH.

29:05.703 --> 29:07.079
SHE SHOOK HIS HAND.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.122
SHE JUST REACHED OUT

29:07.120 --> 29:09.122
AND SHOOK HIS HAND.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.334
IT COMPLETELY THREW HIM OFF.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.334
I SWEAR, THAT GIRL...[ LAUGHS ]

29:12.376 --> 29:15.003
I ALMOST FEEL LIKE A STANDING

29:12.376 --> 29:15.003
OVATION IS IN ORDER.

29:15.045 --> 29:17.297
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET DRAMATIC,

29:15.045 --> 29:17.297
LET'S GO OUTSIDE.

29:17.339 --> 29:18.591
IT ECHOES IN HERE.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.384
WHAT DID YOU THINK

29:18.632 --> 29:20.384
YOU WERE DOING?

29:20.426 --> 29:22.720
I WAS HELPING MY

29:20.426 --> 29:22.720
GRANDDAUGHTER GET INTO WHAT IS,

29:22.761 --> 29:25.264
IN MY OPINION, THE BEST

29:22.761 --> 29:25.264
IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL IN AMERICA.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.307
EVEN THOUGH SHE DOESN'T

29:25.305 --> 29:27.307
WANT TO GO HERE.

29:27.349 --> 29:29.017
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

29:29.059 --> 29:30.603
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

29:30.644 --> 29:32.312
YOU CORNER HER

29:30.644 --> 29:32.312
WITHOUT ME THERE.

29:32.354 --> 29:33.855
YES.

29:32.354 --> 29:33.855
YOU WOULDN'T LET HER GO.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.357
OH, I WOULDN'T?

29:35.399 --> 29:36.692
THE LAST THING

29:35.399 --> 29:36.692
YOU'D WANT

29:36.734 --> 29:38.736
WOULD BE FOR RORY

29:36.734 --> 29:38.736
TO GO TO YALE.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.028
AND THE REASON FOR THAT?

29:40.070 --> 29:41.863
I WENT TO YALE,

29:40.070 --> 29:41.863
THEREFORE RORY CAN'T.

29:41.905 --> 29:44.617
OH, THAT'S RIGHT --

29:41.905 --> 29:44.617
THE CRAZY REASON.

29:44.658 --> 29:46.034
THAT'S ALRIGHT.

29:46.076 --> 29:47.827
IT'S YOUR PREROGATIVE

29:46.076 --> 29:47.827
TO FEEL THAT WAY.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.914
IT'S MINE TO MAKE SURE THAT RORY

29:47.869 --> 29:50.914
KNOWS ALL HER OPTIONS.

29:50.956 --> 29:53.459
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO

29:50.956 --> 29:53.459
SLAP MY FACE WITH A GLOVE?

29:53.500 --> 29:55.001
I'M NOT GOING TO

29:53.500 --> 29:55.001
DISCUSS THIS.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.211
YOU LIED

29:55.043 --> 29:56.211
TO EVERYBODY.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.755
YOU LIED TO ME, TO RORY,

29:57.796 --> 30:00.048
AND MOM -- I'M THINKING

29:57.796 --> 30:00.048
YOU LIED TO HER TOO.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.050
LORELAI, PLEASE,

30:00.090 --> 30:02.050
LET'S TRY AND CALM DOWN.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.594
THIS IS FOR

30:02.092 --> 30:03.594
RORY'S OWN GOOD.

30:03.636 --> 30:04.970
RORY'S GOING

30:03.636 --> 30:04.970
TO HARVARD.

30:05.011 --> 30:07.889
WE'LL SEE.

30:05.011 --> 30:07.889
NO, RORY'S GOING TO HARVARD.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.225
IT'S ALREADY BEEN DECIDED

30:07.931 --> 30:10.225
WITHOUT YOU.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.227
GET IT?

30:10.267 --> 30:12.227
YOU DON'T CONTROL IT.

30:12.269 --> 30:13.771
AND THAT LITTLE STUNT

30:12.269 --> 30:13.771
OF YOURS

30:13.812 --> 30:15.314
DOESN'T CHANGE THAT FACT

30:13.812 --> 30:15.314
ONE BIT.

30:15.355 --> 30:17.857
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE WAY

30:15.355 --> 30:17.857
IT HAD TO BE DONE,

30:17.899 --> 30:19.901
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO ARGUE

30:17.899 --> 30:19.901
ABOUT IT.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.195
MY WHOLE LIFE YOU HAVE TRIED TO

30:19.943 --> 30:22.195
CONTROL EVERYTHING,

30:22.237 --> 30:24.114
IF YOU DIDN'T GET TO

30:22.237 --> 30:24.114
CONTROL SOMETHING

30:24.156 --> 30:25.907
THEN YOU JUST

30:24.156 --> 30:25.907
DIDN'T DEAL WITH IT.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.159
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.702
YOU DIDN'T DEAL WITH ME.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.496
THIS HAS NOTHING

30:28.744 --> 30:30.496
TO DO WITH YOU.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.706
THIS IS ABOUT RORY

30:30.537 --> 30:32.706
AND RORY'S EDUCATION,

30:32.748 --> 30:34.040
WHICH FRANKLY, LORELAI,

30:34.082 --> 30:35.584
IS SOMETHING

30:34.082 --> 30:35.584
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

30:35.626 --> 30:36.960
EXCUSE ME?

30:37.002 --> 30:38.253
YOU NEVER WENT

30:37.002 --> 30:38.253
TO COLLEGE,

30:38.295 --> 30:39.879
YOU DON'T KNOW

30:38.295 --> 30:39.879
THE FIRST THING

30:39.921 --> 30:41.674
ABOUT THE SYSTEM,

30:39.921 --> 30:41.674
THE WAY IT WORKS.

30:41.715 --> 30:43.216
I DO. I WENT THROUGH IT.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.511
YOU WANT RORY TO

30:43.258 --> 30:45.511
GO TO HARVARD THAT BADLY?

30:45.552 --> 30:47.387
WELL, SO DO THOUSANDS

30:45.552 --> 30:47.387
OF OTHER MOTHERS.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.389
YALE IS AN EXCELLENT SCHOOL.

30:49.431 --> 30:52.559
THE EQUAL OF HARVARD

30:49.431 --> 30:52.559
IN EVERY WAY -- EXCEPT ONE.

30:52.601 --> 30:54.311
I WENT HERE.

30:52.601 --> 30:54.311
I'M AN ALUMNUS.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.605
THAT MAKES IT EASIER

30:54.353 --> 30:56.605
FOR RORY TO GET IN.

30:56.647 --> 30:59.399
IF YOU HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT

30:56.647 --> 30:59.399
THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS,

30:59.441 --> 31:00.442
YOU'D KNOW THIS.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.152
OH, SO, HERE IT IS.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.155
KNEW WE'D EVENTUALLY GET TO

31:02.194 --> 31:05.155
THE BIG "MY DAUGHTER'S A LOSER,

31:05.197 --> 31:06.448
"POOR ME, FUTURE SQUANDERED,

31:06.490 --> 31:08.074
THE GILMORE NAME SULLIED"

31:06.490 --> 31:08.074
SPEECH.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.744
I AM NOT GOING TO LEAVE

31:08.116 --> 31:10.744
RORY'S EDUCATION TO CHANCE

31:10.786 --> 31:13.121
SIMPLY BECAUSE I MIGHT RISK

31:10.786 --> 31:13.121
OFFENDING YOU.

31:13.163 --> 31:15.415
HER FUTURE IS MORE IMPORTANT

31:13.163 --> 31:15.415
THAN YOUR PRIDE.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.209
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT,

31:15.457 --> 31:17.209
I'M SORRY.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.503
IF IT MAKES YOU ANGRY,

31:17.250 --> 31:19.503
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

31:19.545 --> 31:21.296
BUT THAT,

31:19.545 --> 31:21.296
IS THE WAY IT IS.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.881
I'M CALLING A CAB.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.881
WE'RE LEAVING.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.681
LORELAI,

31:28.928 --> 31:30.681
COME BACK INSIDE.

31:30.723 --> 31:32.974
LORELAI, PUT THE PHONE AWAY

31:30.723 --> 31:32.974
AND COME BACK INSIDE.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.309
YES, HI. NEW HAVEN.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.603
I NEED THE NUMBER

31:34.351 --> 31:36.603
OF A CAB COMPANY.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.146
UH, ANY ONE. PICK ONE.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.146
THANKS.

31:38.188 --> 31:41.233
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE A CAB

31:38.188 --> 31:41.233
BACK TO STARS HOLLOW.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.276
HE LIED TO YOU TOO.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.276
DON'T YOU CARE?

31:43.318 --> 31:44.820
THAT'S BETWEEN ME

31:43.318 --> 31:44.820
AND YOUR FATHER.

31:44.862 --> 31:46.196
GREAT. WHATEVER.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.865
DAMN, I JUST FORGOT

31:46.238 --> 31:47.865
THE NUMBER.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.950
JUST CALM DOWN AND LOOK AT IT

31:47.906 --> 31:50.950
FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW...

31:50.992 --> 31:53.620
HI. UM, NEW HAVEN.

31:50.992 --> 31:53.620
I NEED A CAB COMPANY.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.247
ANY CAB COMPANY.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.416
YOUR FATHER IS A VERY

31:55.288 --> 31:57.416
STRONG-WILLED MAN, LORELAI.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.334
YOU KNOW THIS.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.334
YOU TAKE AFTER HIM.

31:59.376 --> 32:02.421
HE WANTS THE BEST FOR RORY.

31:59.376 --> 32:02.421
HE THINKS THIS IS THE BEST.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.881
DOESN'T MATTER

32:02.462 --> 32:03.881
WHAT HE THINKS.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.174
IT MATTERS WHAT I THINK,

32:03.922 --> 32:06.174
WHAT RORY THINKS.

32:06.216 --> 32:07.718
RORY TAKES

32:06.216 --> 32:07.718
A MEETING AT YALE.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.636
DOESN'T MEAN

32:07.760 --> 32:09.636
SHE WON'T GO TO HARVARD.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.179
SHE IS GOING

32:09.678 --> 32:11.179
TO HARVARD.

32:11.221 --> 32:13.724
IF SHE APPLIES TO YALE --

32:11.221 --> 32:13.724
SHE'S NOT!

32:13.766 --> 32:17.018
AND GETS IN, MIGHT MAKE HER

32:13.766 --> 32:17.018
MORE APPEALING TO HARVARD.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.062
NO, BECAUSE I'M NOT

32:17.060 --> 32:19.062
TRYING TO REASON AWAY

32:19.104 --> 32:20.313
A CRAZY MAN'S ACTIONS.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.107
DON'T TURN THIS

32:20.355 --> 32:22.107
INTO YET ANOTHER ONE
