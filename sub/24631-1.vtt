02:11.067 --> 02:12.832
The patient has been in our system

02:12.834 --> 02:14.269
for over 30 years.

02:15.435 --> 02:18.432
He came to us when he was young.

02:18.434 --> 02:20.900
He suffers from multiple problems,

02:20.902 --> 02:24.567
including nightmares about his childhood.

02:24.569 --> 02:26.601
He has delusional thoughts that revolve

02:26.603 --> 02:28.970
around dolls and creatures.

02:30.136 --> 02:34.035
Something in his psyche
must be discovered soon

02:34.037 --> 02:37.867
and the answer is there
for all of us to find out.

02:50.105 --> 02:53.102
Go, take him, quick before she can get him.

02:53.104 --> 02:54.238
Run, run, run.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.876
Don't you shut up at all?

03:40.209 --> 03:41.076
Hello?

03:43.943 --> 03:44.944
Who's there?

03:47.576 --> 03:49.177
Hugo, is that you?

04:24.445 --> 04:26.243
At first, we were unsure

04:26.245 --> 04:28.277
what his medical condition was.

04:28.279 --> 04:30.344
He was later diagnosed with paranoid

04:30.346 --> 04:33.144
delusional thought, learning difficulties,

04:33.146 --> 04:34.748
and schizophrenia.

04:35.914 --> 04:37.511
The medication that he
has been administered

04:37.513 --> 04:40.248
must be maintained at all times.

04:42.247 --> 04:46.116
Otherwise he'll have a
tendency to be violent.

05:50.619 --> 05:53.554
Hugo, I told you not to scare me.

06:54.058 --> 06:55.359
Hugo, breakfast.

07:04.025 --> 07:05.889
There you are.

07:34.327 --> 07:35.194
Hugo?

07:36.294 --> 07:39.429
You haven't eaten all of your breakfast.

08:00.462 --> 08:01.929
Yes, I know.

08:01.931 --> 08:03.464
I know it's not her.

08:19.464 --> 08:20.298
Norman?

08:23.332 --> 08:24.199
Norman?

08:27.631 --> 08:29.131
Norman?

08:29.133 --> 08:32.996
It's Johnny, your support worker for today.

08:32.999 --> 08:34.331
Where's Julie?

08:34.332 --> 08:37.198
Julie's on holiday, remember?

08:37.201 --> 08:39.933
She explained I'd be here today.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.198
I have your favorite ice cream

08:43.201 --> 08:45.935
and everything else on the list.

08:49.201 --> 08:51.499
You'd better come in then.

08:51.501 --> 08:53.269
Thank you.

09:12.269 --> 09:14.633
Cup of tea to start I think.

09:14.635 --> 09:16.536
Would you like to help?

09:17.436 --> 09:19.237
I've had breakfast.

09:20.336 --> 09:23.003
Were you expecting someone else?

09:23.938 --> 09:26.069
That's Hugo's.

09:26.071 --> 09:27.171
Who's Hugo?

09:29.103 --> 09:30.968
My friend.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.238
And, where is he?

09:35.205 --> 09:36.038
Around.

09:50.338 --> 09:51.773
Well done you.

09:53.606 --> 09:55.937
Now would you mind doing the washing up.

09:55.939 --> 10:00.073
I'm sure you'll do great, but
can I just use your bathroom?

10:01.073 --> 10:03.139
It's upstairs.

10:03.141 --> 10:04.908
Thank you.

11:14.612 --> 11:15.446
Johnny?

11:23.414 --> 11:26.477
You know he's in your room, don't you?

11:26.479 --> 11:28.414
He's no support worker.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.512
Well who is he then?

11:32.514 --> 11:35.412
He's here for me.

11:35.414 --> 11:37.947
But, no one knows you're here.

11:37.949 --> 11:39.948
Go and get him.

11:55.349 --> 11:56.217
Johnny?

11:58.584 --> 12:00.013
Oh sorry.

12:00.015 --> 12:01.583
Sorry Norman, coming.

12:04.117 --> 12:05.151
Sorry Norman.

12:15.184 --> 12:17.318
Now that is a work of art.

12:22.385 --> 12:25.015
Please he doesn't like to be held.

12:25.017 --> 12:26.218
Yes, he does.

12:27.351 --> 12:28.519
He is awesome.

12:29.886 --> 12:33.184
Please he doesn't take to strangers.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.851
What's his name?

12:34.853 --> 12:35.617
Hugo.

12:35.619 --> 12:37.585
He's my best friend.

12:37.587 --> 12:40.454
Oh right, table setting for two.

12:42.253 --> 12:44.017
Hugo's your friend.

12:44.019 --> 12:45.087
I get it now.

12:50.020 --> 12:54.886
Now, I have an offer for
you you cannot refuse.

12:54.888 --> 12:57.485
I think Hugo there is worth a lot of money.

12:57.487 --> 13:00.219
How would you like me to
get him valued for you?

13:00.221 --> 13:01.886
I have a friend who's quite the expert

13:01.888 --> 13:04.253
when it comes to dummies.

13:04.255 --> 13:06.020
Hugo's a doll.

13:06.022 --> 13:09.253
A bit old to be playing
with dolls, aren't we?

13:09.255 --> 13:11.588
Look it's five minutes down the road.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.487
I can be there and back before you know it.

13:14.489 --> 13:17.888
No, I can't leave the house
because of my condition.

13:17.890 --> 13:20.388
I'll tell you what I'll take him.

13:20.390 --> 13:21.555
It's just down the road.

13:21.557 --> 13:22.487
I'll get him...

13:22.489 --> 13:25.190
No, no, you need to leave now.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.824
Hugo's staying here with me.

13:29.991 --> 13:31.223
That's fine.

13:31.225 --> 13:32.555
That's fine.

13:32.557 --> 13:34.322
I was only trying to help.

13:34.324 --> 13:36.089
No hard feelings?

13:36.091 --> 13:37.091
Please go.

13:40.059 --> 13:41.257
Are you sure?

13:41.259 --> 13:42.093
Just go!

13:58.393 --> 14:01.093
You don't listen to me.

14:07.493 --> 14:08.928
He's gone now.

14:10.261 --> 14:12.195
He'll be back.

16:50.474 --> 16:51.341
Hugo?

16:52.241 --> 16:53.074
Hugo.

18:41.984 --> 18:43.181
Hey?

18:43.183 --> 18:46.082
Hey what the hell you doing?

18:46.084 --> 18:49.248
Sorry I haven't been out
of my house in a long time.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.648
Yeah it looks like it, mate.

18:50.650 --> 18:52.185
27 quid plus tip.

18:59.352 --> 19:01.683
Hey, you sure you're okay?

19:01.685 --> 19:03.516
You sure you want to be out here all alone?

19:03.518 --> 19:05.319
It will be dark soon.

19:06.352 --> 19:07.853
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:09.151 --> 19:11.050
I mean I can hang around if you need me to.

19:11.052 --> 19:12.384
You know there's nothing out here.

19:12.386 --> 19:13.916
Even the junkies don't come out here.

19:13.918 --> 19:16.351
They say it's cursed.

19:16.353 --> 19:18.187
I need to find Hugo.

19:19.151 --> 19:20.352
Oh, whatever.

19:23.087 --> 19:25.884
Bloody leave the door open.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.260
Go take him.

20:59.262 --> 21:01.058
Quick before she can get him.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.162
Run, run, run.

21:28.062 --> 21:29.295
Medical diagnosis

21:29.297 --> 21:30.631
as schizophrenia.

21:32.196 --> 21:33.062
Old to be playing with dolls,

21:33.064 --> 21:34.428
aren't we?

21:34.430 --> 21:35.864
Norman.

23:31.673 --> 23:33.638
We're rolling, you lot?

23:33.640 --> 23:35.205
Camera set, rolling.

23:35.207 --> 23:38.341
Okay we're here doing our test shoot

23:39.941 --> 23:42.906
at an undisclosed location where we hope

23:42.908 --> 23:47.042
we are one step closer to
the mystery of the dolls.

23:47.908 --> 23:49.274
We're here, I'm Sarah.

23:49.276 --> 23:53.139
We've got Johnny with us, our expert.

23:53.141 --> 23:54.439
We've got our team.

23:54.441 --> 23:56.007
We've got security.

23:56.009 --> 23:58.074
Marco on sound, we've got our sound guys,

23:58.076 --> 23:59.343
our camera guys.

24:00.342 --> 24:02.577
So okay, Steve, you're here.

24:04.377 --> 24:05.608
You're the owner of the house.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.340
He's just gonna show us where to find

24:08.342 --> 24:12.008
the tunnels and just
talk us through quickly

24:12.010 --> 24:13.877
on what we might find.

24:15.011 --> 24:17.276
Well I don't know what you're expecting.

24:17.278 --> 24:19.145
I've got some stories.

24:20.310 --> 24:22.508
About the tunnels?

24:22.510 --> 24:24.110
Do tell.

24:24.112 --> 24:26.276
Would you mind, could
we just get those quickly

24:26.278 --> 24:27.210
on camera?

24:27.212 --> 24:28.242
Just a couple of minutes.

24:28.244 --> 24:31.442
Marco, can I just get the boom.

24:31.444 --> 24:35.143
How long you've lived here, mate, anyway?

24:35.145 --> 24:37.344
Well we've owned it for eight years.

24:37.346 --> 24:38.211
Eight years?

24:38.213 --> 24:39.310
Yeah, the site.

24:39.312 --> 24:40.643
And, the site is quite big.

24:40.645 --> 24:41.513
Stories?

24:42.413 --> 24:43.678
You've got some stories.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.077
Yeah, yeah.

24:45.079 --> 24:48.912
Well basically I can tell you some stories

24:48.914 --> 24:49.978
about this place.

24:49.980 --> 24:51.312
I know you guys are here.

24:51.314 --> 24:53.679
I know Johnny has come
up and asked me before

24:53.681 --> 24:56.311
about the doll mystery.

24:56.313 --> 24:59.177
I don't know much about it, but I do know

24:59.179 --> 25:01.145
that I've been here for eight years,

25:01.147 --> 25:02.946
and as you can see, this
has taken eight years

25:02.948 --> 25:07.045
to get as far as this because
every time we attempted

25:07.047 --> 25:10.413
with builders and
contractors something happens.

25:10.415 --> 25:12.114
Yeah, I'll tell you what I can do you

25:12.116 --> 25:14.147
a good deal on builders if you want it.

25:14.149 --> 25:15.545
You know what I mean?

25:15.547 --> 25:17.679
I mean eight years to get
to this is quite appalling.

25:17.681 --> 25:19.380
Sorry, carry on.

25:19.382 --> 25:23.516
Well the stories are, I
mean basically we've had

25:25.249 --> 25:29.181
quite a lot of accidents and strange things

25:29.183 --> 25:32.915
happening in the back room,
voices that kind of thing,

25:32.917 --> 25:35.550
all the kind of paranormal stuff.

25:37.683 --> 25:39.482
We've had a lot of damp.

25:39.484 --> 25:41.516
We've also had things go missing.

25:41.518 --> 25:43.348
A lot of contractors were annoyed

25:43.350 --> 25:45.349
because things would disappear.

25:45.351 --> 25:49.282
We've had deliveries come, and
it's cost me a lot of money.

25:49.284 --> 25:53.682
And, you know it's just
that people I can't seem

25:53.684 --> 25:55.118
to get any help.

25:56.985 --> 25:58.516
Hey mate, this is a nice piece.

25:58.518 --> 26:00.019
What's this from?

26:01.119 --> 26:04.183
Yeah, that's done by my wife.

26:04.185 --> 26:05.550
Oh really?

26:05.552 --> 26:07.450
If you don't mind that's quite valuable.

26:07.452 --> 26:08.917
Oh okay, no worries, mate.

26:08.919 --> 26:11.051
Sorry Steve, carry on.

26:11.053 --> 26:13.486
Yeah so we've had incidents.

26:14.587 --> 26:17.318
I mean I know what you guys are here for,

26:17.320 --> 26:20.452
and I know that you have come to do

26:20.454 --> 26:21.618
this doll mystery thing.

26:21.620 --> 26:22.985
I don't know anything about that.

26:22.987 --> 26:26.552
I know there's been,
in the past there's been

26:26.554 --> 26:29.053
stories of people going missing.

26:29.055 --> 26:33.252
And, children used to
get in here and disappear,

26:33.254 --> 26:35.519
but we're going back to Victorian times

26:35.521 --> 26:36.719
and things like that.

26:36.721 --> 26:38.553
You know it's all kind
of, so many mysteries,

26:38.555 --> 26:40.220
it all overlaps each other.

26:40.222 --> 26:42.354
I'm quite fascinated by
the ghost side of things,

26:42.356 --> 26:45.186
but I'm not sure whether that's true

26:45.188 --> 26:47.654
- with the dolls thing.
- Do you get that feeling...

26:47.656 --> 26:49.553
Ghosts, what kind of ghosts?

26:49.555 --> 26:51.225
What have you seen?

26:52.989 --> 26:56.255
That's not what made you
stop the renovation was it?

26:56.257 --> 26:59.455
Well the renovations basically because

26:59.457 --> 27:02.522
they say, you know we're
over here for instance,

27:02.524 --> 27:06.623
and we were doing these
electrics and every time...

27:06.625 --> 27:08.189
Be careful with that.

27:08.191 --> 27:11.622
Every time we've plastered in the area.

27:11.624 --> 27:12.622
As you can see...

27:12.624 --> 27:13.490
Be careful.

27:13.492 --> 27:15.124
Don't touch it.

27:15.126 --> 27:16.623
That could be alive, you know what I mean?

27:16.625 --> 27:18.556
Every time we've done it,

27:18.558 --> 27:22.591
we've come back, and
within a day, it's all off.

27:22.593 --> 27:25.391
Or, it's just not setting
and stuff like that.

27:25.393 --> 27:28.658
Can you tell us about the devil?

27:28.660 --> 27:30.557
I mean that's just kids.

27:30.559 --> 27:31.925
Kids?

27:31.927 --> 27:32.591
You know you can see it's underneath

27:32.593 --> 27:33.957
where the plaster was.

27:33.959 --> 27:35.258
Are you sure it's just kids.

27:35.260 --> 27:37.291
See the thing is this entrance

27:37.293 --> 27:39.525
is the kind of official entrance.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.125
Right, okay.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.559
But, we do have other
places that people get in.

27:43.561 --> 27:44.493
We can't keep 'em out.

27:44.495 --> 27:46.492
It's such a big area.

27:46.494 --> 27:49.692
Just because I suppose
they think it's abandoned,

27:49.694 --> 27:51.294
not lived in, this part.

27:51.296 --> 27:53.659
Well you get a lot of
just weird people really,

27:53.661 --> 27:55.026
strange people.

27:55.028 --> 27:57.426
You get occultists, things like that.

27:57.428 --> 28:01.495
It's probably something,
you know they've got in here.

28:02.930 --> 28:05.527
Oh well, that's just kids, isn't it?

28:05.529 --> 28:07.127
It didn't say in our petition.

28:07.129 --> 28:09.094
He's talking about evil people.

28:09.096 --> 28:11.460
I mean this place goes back

28:11.462 --> 28:14.561
to Victorian, even before that Napoleon.

28:14.563 --> 28:16.161
And, I think they had gunpowder here.

28:16.163 --> 28:17.662
They probably had accidents here.

28:17.664 --> 28:19.162
Yeah I noticed that when I came in.

28:19.164 --> 28:20.995
I could smell some gunpowder actually.

28:20.997 --> 28:23.929
And, they've obviously had people die.

28:23.931 --> 28:28.065
So I have had one thing happen
with something mysterious

28:30.065 --> 28:33.130
which was here in this very room.

28:33.132 --> 28:34.530
What happened?

28:34.532 --> 28:38.297
Where we was here, I was in
the corner doing some stuff.

28:38.299 --> 28:42.163
And, I turned around thinking
it was my wife standing there,

28:42.165 --> 28:44.930
and my wife was actually
outside the window.

28:44.932 --> 28:46.464
Well she was probably
doing that sculpture mate,

28:46.466 --> 28:48.031
you know what I mean?

28:48.033 --> 28:51.664
No, I know it was weird
because when I turned around

28:51.666 --> 28:54.665
and looked there was a lady standing there.

28:54.667 --> 28:58.668
And, she was quite, you
know, makeup, long hair,

29:01.334 --> 29:04.532
but then when I turned
back, my wife was outside.

29:04.534 --> 29:07.332
When I turned back
again, this girl had gone.

29:07.334 --> 29:09.032
Has it put you off wanting to finish

29:09.034 --> 29:10.465
getting the work done?

29:10.467 --> 29:12.032
Well I mean yeah, 'cause I
was having to do it myself.

29:12.034 --> 29:13.600
So at that stage, all the
builders weren't around,

29:13.602 --> 29:15.600
and I was in here trying
to sort some stuff out.

29:15.602 --> 29:17.034
Fucking bullshit, mate.

29:17.036 --> 29:18.301
So it's that kind of thing that goes on.

29:18.303 --> 29:21.533
I mean what I will say,
I mean I can show you

29:21.535 --> 29:23.166
this back room because the back room...

29:23.168 --> 29:24.334
That'd be great.

29:24.336 --> 29:25.534
And where the tunnels are.

29:25.536 --> 29:26.700
Hang on a minute.

29:26.702 --> 29:28.101
Before you all go, let me just check to see

29:28.103 --> 29:29.070
if it's okay.

29:30.100 --> 29:30.368
I'll go with the owner a minute.

29:30.370 --> 29:32.035
Just hang on a minute.

29:32.037 --> 29:34.035
So where we going then, mate?

29:34.037 --> 29:38.601
It's down here, and the
tunnels are that way.

29:38.603 --> 29:39.734
But, I'll just show you this room.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.368
All right before you go,

29:41.370 --> 29:42.734
can I just check these stairs, mate?

29:42.736 --> 29:44.236
Just to make sure.

29:44.238 --> 29:45.402
Is there anything up
here that we need to see?

29:45.404 --> 29:46.603
No, there's nothing up there.

29:46.605 --> 29:48.168
All right.

29:48.170 --> 29:49.402
Well let me just check anyway
just to see if it's okay.

29:49.404 --> 29:52.469
So what's through here, Steve?

29:52.471 --> 29:53.936
Yeah it seems okay.

29:53.938 --> 29:55.202
Do you know what I mean?

29:55.204 --> 29:57.003
That'll be my wife's bedroom,

29:57.005 --> 29:59.370
but it's where everybody says...

29:59.372 --> 30:00.937
Are you getting this, Marco?

30:00.939 --> 30:04.403
It's where everybody says
they sense the things are.

30:04.405 --> 30:07.238
Well I mean one of my
builders said that he saw

30:07.240 --> 30:10.006
a child like creep thing in there

30:11.139 --> 30:13.070
looking at him, watching.

30:13.072 --> 30:16.404
And, they've heard footsteps
and voice and things like that.

30:16.406 --> 30:17.507
So you know...

30:18.408 --> 30:20.039
There's nothing in here.

30:20.041 --> 30:21.238
Well there's nothing in here now.

30:21.240 --> 30:25.338
I mean these things are
over, remember it's over

30:25.340 --> 30:27.940
an eight year period
that this all happened.

30:29.440 --> 30:30.939
So for me it's a business, and we've lost

30:30.941 --> 30:33.106
a lot of money on this.

30:33.108 --> 30:37.507
And, I believe in bits
of it and not other bits.

30:37.509 --> 30:38.673
So yeah I mean...

30:38.675 --> 30:41.540
What are you doing here now then?

30:41.542 --> 30:45.241
At the moment, obviously Sarah's paid

30:45.243 --> 30:46.441
to come here and do this.

30:46.443 --> 30:47.973
Oh she's paid you money, has she?

30:47.975 --> 30:49.173
All right.

30:49.175 --> 30:51.108
It's a business, isn't it?

30:51.110 --> 30:55.540
I'm just gonna warn you
guys because I say this

30:55.542 --> 30:57.608
to all the contractors when they come in.

30:57.610 --> 31:01.542
I say I'm not responsible
for anything that happens.

31:01.544 --> 31:04.042
We'll be fine.

31:04.044 --> 31:05.242
They say that.

31:05.244 --> 31:06.642
We'll be fine, we've got Johnny.

31:06.644 --> 31:08.043
They all don't believe
it, and something happens.

31:08.045 --> 31:09.309
So you're going to be going down to an area

31:09.311 --> 31:11.208
that I don't even want to go down to.

31:11.210 --> 31:12.975
But, I've been here eight years.

31:12.977 --> 31:14.976
So whatever happens down there.

31:14.978 --> 31:16.609
We've had a contractor go down,

31:16.611 --> 31:19.009
and had to change all the
bulbs, fix all the bulbs,

31:19.011 --> 31:22.643
get 'em all done, and
he lasted five minutes.

31:22.645 --> 31:24.311
And, he came out of that white as a sheet.

31:24.313 --> 31:25.577
And, he said he saw something.

31:25.579 --> 31:27.078
Something touched him, he said, on the back

31:27.080 --> 31:29.411
of his shoulder and grabbed him.

31:29.413 --> 31:30.978
You've got a lot of dust out there.

31:30.980 --> 31:33.544
I mean that could be, that
could potentially be...

31:33.546 --> 31:36.145
When you go down there
guys be very careful.

31:36.147 --> 31:37.645
There's long stairs that goes down.

31:37.647 --> 31:40.679
It goes underneath the kind of area

31:40.681 --> 31:42.145
right into these tunnels.

31:42.147 --> 31:42.978
We're well lit.

31:42.980 --> 31:45.111
The guys have got.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.312
I'm just warning you now.

31:46.314 --> 31:48.680
We've got it on camera, so I'm warning you.

31:48.682 --> 31:50.278
That's fine.

31:50.280 --> 31:52.412
Do you know what, Sarah, I think actually

31:52.414 --> 31:53.646
Malik?

31:53.648 --> 31:55.046
You could audition him for your new show.

31:55.048 --> 31:56.047
I think he'd make a good actor actually.

31:56.049 --> 31:57.179
Malik, shut up.

31:57.181 --> 31:58.382
What?

31:59.515 --> 32:01.013
Do you know what this is?

32:01.015 --> 32:02.116
It's a finger.

32:03.382 --> 32:05.917
Mate, this is a false wall.

32:07.417 --> 32:08.947
You could've just done that now.

32:08.949 --> 32:10.147
You know what I mean?

32:10.149 --> 32:10.682
I didn't just do that now.

32:10.684 --> 32:11.515
It was there.

32:11.517 --> 32:12.248
Yeah, but look.

32:12.250 --> 32:13.480
Look at it.

32:13.482 --> 32:15.514
- Is there one entrance?
- it's not solid, mate.

32:15.516 --> 32:18.081
I'm just a little bit concerned
about your security guard

32:18.083 --> 32:20.449
cause he's like, he seems quite.

32:20.451 --> 32:21.681
What?

32:21.683 --> 32:23.114
Well you seem like.

32:23.116 --> 32:24.748
No, I just think, to be honest with you.

32:24.750 --> 32:25.682
It's all right.

32:25.684 --> 32:27.015
All right.

32:27.017 --> 32:27.683
I just think it's a load of bollocks.

32:27.685 --> 32:29.183
All right, Malik.

32:29.185 --> 32:31.716
What you've gotta remember
is that you paid me

32:31.718 --> 32:32.582
for this place.

32:32.584 --> 32:33.748
I own it.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.316
Yeah, I know I understand that.

32:35.318 --> 32:36.283
If you go down there and something happens,

32:36.285 --> 32:37.382
I ain't coming to get you.

32:37.384 --> 32:38.550
No, I know.

32:38.552 --> 32:39.383
Well that's all right, man.

32:39.385 --> 32:40.317
That's all right.

32:40.319 --> 32:41.151
I mean that's what I'm paid for,

32:41.153 --> 32:42.316
so don't worry about it.

32:42.318 --> 32:43.250
I'll show you down to the tunnels.

32:43.252 --> 32:44.383
Can we hurray this up please?

32:44.385 --> 32:45.450
I'm not going down there.

32:45.452 --> 32:46.650
- It's as simple as that.
- All right.

32:46.652 --> 32:47.984
That's fine, I didn't ask you to.

32:47.986 --> 32:50.050
I just want to get this moving, you know?

32:50.052 --> 32:52.750
I want to get seeing these tunnels.

32:52.752 --> 32:54.985
You might be excited now.

32:54.987 --> 32:56.084
I'll tell you what thing gonna be...

32:56.086 --> 32:57.319
Believe me...

32:57.321 --> 32:58.751
Nothing's gonna stop my passion.

32:58.753 --> 33:00.385
I love this, I live for this.

33:00.387 --> 33:01.551
Malik?

33:01.553 --> 33:03.384
Fucking actor, you know what I mean?

33:03.386 --> 33:04.552
Malik?

33:04.554 --> 33:06.119
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's all right.

33:06.121 --> 33:07.253
I'm just checking a bit of
this, that, and the others,

33:07.255 --> 33:09.019
do you know what I mean?

33:09.021 --> 33:09.718
Where are we going?

33:09.720 --> 33:11.052
All right, okay, sorry.

33:11.054 --> 33:12.952
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, I know it.

33:12.954 --> 33:14.085
The doors are unlocked.

33:14.087 --> 33:15.353
I'm not going anywhere past this door.

33:15.355 --> 33:17.086
Sorry, sorry mate, sorry.

33:17.088 --> 33:18.652
Do you want to take the keys?

33:18.654 --> 33:20.053
No, you guys go through,

33:20.055 --> 33:22.453
then I'm gonna shut the door behind you.

33:22.455 --> 33:26.123
All right, well thank you, Steve.

33:27.323 --> 33:28.387
Yeah, thanks Steve.

33:28.389 --> 33:29.587
Appreciate it, mate.

33:29.589 --> 33:30.753
Guys, we're gonna make our way down

33:30.755 --> 33:34.590
to the tunnels and see
what we can find there.

33:40.457 --> 33:41.655
Hang on here darling.

33:41.657 --> 33:43.021
Give him a minute.

33:43.023 --> 33:46.392
He's a bit delirious,
do you know what I mean?

33:47.458 --> 33:48.325
Norman?

33:50.658 --> 33:51.524
Norman?

33:54.024 --> 33:54.892
Norman?

33:56.657 --> 33:57.524
Norman.

34:01.092 --> 34:02.589
Norman.

34:02.591 --> 34:03.456
Hello?

34:03.458 --> 34:04.456
Listen don't be afraid.

34:04.458 --> 34:06.123
There's nothing to worry about.

34:06.125 --> 34:07.091
Don't worry about the cameras.

34:07.093 --> 34:08.291
They're with me.

34:08.293 --> 34:10.958
Listen, I need you to listen to me.

34:10.960 --> 34:14.493
Norman, my name's Sarah,
and I'm a producer.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.190
And, all of my friends are here.

34:17.193 --> 34:18.389
Listen.

34:18.391 --> 34:21.025
All these cameras, they're with me.

34:21.027 --> 34:22.757
We're making a program, Norman.

34:22.759 --> 34:25.326
We're making a documentary.

34:25.328 --> 34:28.158
We're here to talk to you
about your dolls, Norman.

34:28.159 --> 34:30.092
We want to talk to you about, Hugo.

34:32.226 --> 34:33.960
Come on, up you get.

34:37.262 --> 34:41.626
Now listen, I'm just gonna
grab a microphone for you.

34:41.628 --> 34:42.493
You all right, mate?

34:42.495 --> 34:44.362
You want a cup of tea?

34:46.962 --> 34:47.628
What, two sugars?

34:47.630 --> 34:48.659
Or, you sweet enough?

34:48.661 --> 34:50.293
Listen, I've got one.

34:50.295 --> 34:51.360
Johnny's got one.

34:51.362 --> 34:53.027
You remember Johnny, don't you?

34:53.029 --> 34:55.428
Hey Norman, do you remember me?

34:55.429 --> 34:56.594
Listen.

34:56.596 --> 34:59.262
I came to look after you, remember?

34:59.264 --> 35:00.361
There you go.

35:00.363 --> 35:01.528
Johnny's your friend.

35:01.530 --> 35:04.395
You met him this morning, didn't you?

35:04.397 --> 35:05.461
You remember Johnny, don't you?

35:05.463 --> 35:06.395
It's okay.

35:06.397 --> 35:07.562
He knows about Hugo.

35:07.564 --> 35:10.129
We wanted to just talk to you about Hugo.

35:10.131 --> 35:11.063
Hugo?

35:11.065 --> 35:12.196
- Hugo, yes.
- Hugo.

35:12.198 --> 35:13.729
Yes, Hugo.

35:13.731 --> 35:15.329
Your doll, remember your dolls.

35:15.331 --> 35:16.329
I think we should make
a fucking porno actually.

35:16.331 --> 35:18.463
There you go touching him up.

35:18.465 --> 35:19.663
Where's Hugo?

35:19.665 --> 35:22.595
Norman, do you talk to Hugo?

35:22.597 --> 35:23.966
Norman, Norman?

35:25.432 --> 35:27.397
Did Hugo talk to you?

35:27.399 --> 35:29.034
Do you talk to him?

35:31.499 --> 35:33.164
Julie?

35:33.166 --> 35:35.164
Julie's not here, no.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.031
I'm Johnny.

35:36.033 --> 35:37.300
You took Hugo.

35:38.467 --> 35:42.164
I told you he doesn't like to be handled.

35:42.166 --> 35:43.498
Guys, don't get too close.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.731
He's getting a bit stressed out now,

35:44.733 --> 35:46.531
do you know what I mean?

35:46.533 --> 35:48.666
All right, well don't fucking,

35:48.668 --> 35:49.533
if he goes fucking mental
don't fucking blame me.

35:49.535 --> 35:50.699
Norman, calm down.

35:50.701 --> 35:53.665
Norman, there is nothing
to worry about here.

35:53.667 --> 35:54.967
We're your friends.

35:54.969 --> 35:56.100
- You know me.
- They're bright.

35:56.102 --> 35:57.498
It's okay they're just cameras.

35:57.500 --> 35:58.366
They're with me, they're all with me.

35:58.368 --> 35:59.200
They're just cameras.

35:59.202 --> 36:00.067
It's fine.

36:00.069 --> 36:01.033
They're with us.

36:01.035 --> 36:02.300
They're all with me.

36:02.302 --> 36:03.033
- We just want to talk to you
- Listen to me.

36:03.035 --> 36:03.967
about Hugo.

36:03.969 --> 36:05.703
All right, Norman, talk to us.

36:07.135 --> 36:08.034
We're your friends.

36:08.036 --> 36:09.301
We're fine.

36:09.303 --> 36:11.368
Sarah, tell me all of it.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.567
Do you remember when I
came in for the interview,

36:13.569 --> 36:16.133
and you said you wanted me to do something.

36:16.135 --> 36:17.134
Where's Hugo?

36:17.136 --> 36:18.535
I don't know.

36:18.537 --> 36:20.535
I've done that, and you know
everything's secure here.

36:20.537 --> 36:21.735
He's not dangerous anymore.

36:21.737 --> 36:24.235
Listen he's not dangerous anymore,

36:24.237 --> 36:26.568
so I think, you know, you can sort me out

36:26.570 --> 36:28.669
with my rates, do you know what I mean?

36:28.671 --> 36:30.702
Have you been here before?

36:30.704 --> 36:31.704
Do you know?

36:33.238 --> 36:34.436
Are you ignoring me again?

36:34.438 --> 36:35.337
It's in my dreams.

36:35.339 --> 36:37.469
Hold on.

36:37.471 --> 36:38.736
Your dreams?

36:38.738 --> 36:40.202
Tell us about your dreams.

36:40.204 --> 36:42.236
Your dreams, Norman?

36:42.238 --> 36:43.170
Are you getting this?

36:43.172 --> 36:44.170
Norman your dreams?

36:44.172 --> 36:45.337
Talk to me about your dreams.

36:45.339 --> 36:46.171
You sure you don't want

36:46.173 --> 36:47.304
a cup of tea, mate?

36:47.306 --> 36:49.337
Yeah, you're talking about dreams.

36:49.339 --> 36:50.571
Shutup.

36:50.573 --> 36:52.136
It's not wet dreams, is it?

36:52.138 --> 36:54.136
- Tell us about the dreams.
- Norman, Norman.

36:54.138 --> 36:55.570
I don't know.

36:55.572 --> 36:56.670
Norman, tell me about your dream.

36:56.672 --> 36:57.537
I don't know.

36:57.539 --> 36:58.405
I don't know.

36:58.407 --> 36:59.537
I don't know.

36:59.539 --> 37:00.971
He's getting frustrated.

37:00.973 --> 37:02.171
Just come away from him.

37:02.173 --> 37:03.639
I don't know, I don't know.

37:03.641 --> 37:04.772
He's fine.

37:04.774 --> 37:06.172
He's getting frustrated.

37:06.174 --> 37:07.405
Look I know about these situations.

37:07.407 --> 37:09.272
Aren't you a social worker or something,

37:09.274 --> 37:11.139
but I know how to deal
with these situations.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.573
There's no need to get yourself worked up.

37:12.575 --> 37:13.472
He knows me.

37:13.474 --> 37:15.106
Knows you?

37:15.108 --> 37:16.306
Yes.

37:16.308 --> 37:17.472
Nobody's here to hurt you, all right?

37:17.474 --> 37:19.040
What you went around his place,

37:19.042 --> 37:20.239
and we fucking, you're
best friends now or what?

37:20.241 --> 37:21.673
Okay, nobody's here to hurt you.

37:21.675 --> 37:24.639
We just want to talk to you about Hugo,

37:24.641 --> 37:26.109
all right, okay?

37:27.275 --> 37:29.943
Can you tell us about the dreams?

37:31.443 --> 37:32.641
What did you see?

37:32.643 --> 37:33.774
I still think you're
taking a liberty, you know?

37:33.776 --> 37:36.107
I don't know just a dream.

37:36.109 --> 37:38.442
What dream, do you remember?

37:38.444 --> 37:39.508
Here I've seen.

37:39.510 --> 37:41.008
Here Norman?

37:41.010 --> 37:42.275
What about here?

37:42.277 --> 37:43.542
Was Hugo in the dreams?

37:43.544 --> 37:45.441
Where's Hugo?

37:45.443 --> 37:46.708
I want Hugo.

37:46.710 --> 37:48.076
I want Hugo.

37:48.078 --> 37:49.309
Hugo, where for art thou, Hugo?

37:49.311 --> 37:50.774
Where are you Hugo?

37:50.776 --> 37:52.308
Hold on, hold on, look, look.

37:52.310 --> 37:53.676
You've taken Hugo.

37:53.678 --> 37:55.009
You've got Hugo.

37:55.011 --> 37:55.743
- No, it's fine.
- Who's taken Hugo?

37:55.745 --> 37:57.210
We'll get you Hugo.

37:57.212 --> 37:59.309
If you want Hugo, we can find you Hugo

37:59.311 --> 38:02.576
if you tell us where the secret passage is.

38:02.578 --> 38:03.443
There's a secret passage.

38:03.445 --> 38:05.010
I know there is.

38:05.012 --> 38:06.376
Norman do you know anything about that?

38:06.378 --> 38:07.513
I want Hugo.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.078
You can get Hugo.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.110
Listen how long are we
gonna be here with this?

38:11.112 --> 38:11.978
Norman, listen to me.

38:11.980 --> 38:12.676
Hugo.

38:12.678 --> 38:13.777
- Listen to me.
- Hugo!

38:13.779 --> 38:15.211
- Give you a minute?
- Norman.

38:15.213 --> 38:17.178
- Hugo?
- Where is Hugo?

38:17.180 --> 38:18.378
Hugo?

38:18.380 --> 38:19.511
Norman, we need you to be very brave

38:19.513 --> 38:21.645
talking to us now, all right?

38:21.647 --> 38:23.545
We need you to be very brave for us?

38:23.547 --> 38:25.312
Can you do that, Norman?

38:25.314 --> 38:27.312
Hang on a minute.

38:27.314 --> 38:28.478
Come back here, mate.

38:30.181 --> 38:31.446
Malik, get off him.

38:31.448 --> 38:32.512
Malik.

38:32.514 --> 38:33.712
Malik!

38:33.714 --> 38:36.712
Norman, Norman, Norman, Norman?

38:36.714 --> 38:38.512
Just stand him up, just get him up.

38:38.514 --> 38:39.979
Just get him up.

38:39.981 --> 38:41.080
Get him up.

38:41.082 --> 38:43.145
Norman, Norman, Norman, Norman, Norman?

38:43.147 --> 38:44.047
He's secure, he's secure.

38:44.049 --> 38:45.346
Norman, Norman.

38:45.348 --> 38:46.379
You all right, mate?

38:46.381 --> 38:47.348
Norman, Norman, Norman.

38:47.350 --> 38:48.213
You sure?

38:48.215 --> 38:50.014
You all right, mate?

38:50.016 --> 38:50.980
You okay?

38:50.982 --> 38:52.347
Fuck, Norman?

38:52.349 --> 38:53.547
That's it, Norman.

38:53.549 --> 38:54.581
He's got you, Norman.

38:54.583 --> 38:57.380
He's fucking chocked as well.

38:57.382 --> 38:58.781
All right just let him go a bit.

38:58.783 --> 39:00.048
You sure?

39:00.050 --> 39:01.015
- Let him go a bit!
- You sure?

39:01.017 --> 39:01.780
Let him go a bit.

39:01.782 --> 39:02.714
All right I'm not responsible.

39:02.716 --> 39:04.048
Let him go a bit.

39:04.050 --> 39:04.749
It's all right Norman, Norman, Norman?

39:04.751 --> 39:06.348
You're taking a piss.

39:06.350 --> 39:07.748
Taking the piss?

39:07.750 --> 39:08.682
That's what I do, mate.

39:08.684 --> 39:09.782
No need to fucking fight.

39:09.784 --> 39:11.414
This is what I do, mate.

39:11.416 --> 39:12.482
I'm fucking security.

39:12.484 --> 39:14.615
That's what she employed me for.

39:14.617 --> 39:16.716
Don't know what you're employed for.

39:16.718 --> 39:19.115
You didn't even fucking steal
the fucking thing, did you?

39:19.117 --> 39:22.249
All right, just let him be a minute, okay?

39:22.251 --> 39:24.549
You're a fucking nonce mate, fucking nonce.

39:24.551 --> 39:28.452
Norman, Norman, that's it, all right?

39:30.720 --> 39:31.587
Come on.

39:32.653 --> 39:34.384
Come on.

39:34.386 --> 39:38.452
All right, we'll pop these
back on for you, come on

39:38.454 --> 39:39.451
Come on get your glasses on.

39:39.453 --> 39:41.184
There you go.

39:41.186 --> 39:42.718
There you are.

39:42.720 --> 39:45.385
Sorry about that, mate, sorry.

39:45.387 --> 39:48.218
There you are.

39:50.187 --> 39:52.218
All right, okay.

39:52.220 --> 39:56.052
Listen mate, you really wanna watch

39:56.054 --> 39:58.153
who you're talking to,
do you know what I mean?

39:58.155 --> 39:59.219
Just in case, you know.

39:59.221 --> 40:00.485
Let him go, let him go.

40:00.487 --> 40:01.785
It's all right.

40:01.787 --> 40:03.353
I'm keeping him secure just like I did

40:03.355 --> 40:06.420
with Norman there, do you know what I mean?

40:06.422 --> 40:07.753
He's all right.

40:07.755 --> 40:09.287
I'm fucking babysitting three kids here.

40:09.289 --> 40:10.153
Oh GB.

40:11.522 --> 40:13.320
Sorry mate, sorry about that.

40:13.322 --> 40:14.686
You all right, mate?

40:14.688 --> 40:16.020
Sorry about that mate.

40:16.022 --> 40:17.253
Norman, do you think you might be ready

40:17.255 --> 40:18.087
- to talk to me yet?
- He's all right.

40:18.089 --> 40:19.254
You all right, mate?

40:19.256 --> 40:20.554
Don't mean a thing.

40:30.190 --> 40:34.588
I wanna talk about my
five grand, all right?

40:34.590 --> 40:37.055
I think she fancies the
guy, do you know what I mean?

40:37.057 --> 40:38.422
What are you fucking
talking about money for

40:38.424 --> 40:39.390
in front of people?

40:39.392 --> 40:40.789
What are you fucking playing at?

40:40.791 --> 40:42.489
What do you mean?

40:42.491 --> 40:43.756
Listen...

40:43.758 --> 40:45.290
Listen we had an agreement, right?

40:45.292 --> 40:46.523
When I came for the
interview, you said to me

40:46.525 --> 40:48.590
that you wanted muscle
which I've done for you.

40:48.592 --> 40:49.690
You can have your fucking money,

40:49.692 --> 40:50.756
but you mind your etiquette.

40:50.758 --> 40:52.157
All right, fucking all right.

40:52.159 --> 40:53.390
You listen to me, and you listen good.

40:53.392 --> 40:54.623
Okay.

40:54.625 --> 40:56.523
Because I may not be
as stupid as my sister,

40:56.525 --> 40:58.024
and you know why?

40:58.026 --> 40:59.458
Why?

40:59.460 --> 41:01.392
She may not know what's
going on, but I fucking do.

41:01.394 --> 41:02.528
Norman, hey?

41:03.659 --> 41:05.225
Hey it's me.

41:05.227 --> 41:06.157
A friend, see?

41:06.159 --> 41:08.057
Not like that nasty guy.

41:08.059 --> 41:10.624
The nasty man, did he hurt you?

41:10.626 --> 41:11.460
He's gone.

41:12.328 --> 41:13.525
Did he hurt you?

41:13.527 --> 41:16.293
And, she will find out, all right?

41:16.295 --> 41:18.226
So I suggest you take your money

41:18.228 --> 41:21.026
and fuck off away from me.

41:21.028 --> 41:22.459
Do you know what I like?

41:22.461 --> 41:24.493
In fact do you know what,
I mean I've got a saying

41:24.495 --> 41:28.093
that I didn't think of you
in that same sort of a light,

41:28.095 --> 41:30.160
but you know you're
really turning me on a bit.

41:34.729 --> 41:37.261
Is that five grand in 20s then?

41:37.263 --> 41:38.494
Fuck you!

41:38.496 --> 41:39.363
Bitch.

41:43.496 --> 41:46.029
How do I get out of this fucking place?

41:46.031 --> 41:47.461
Fucking unbelievable?

41:47.463 --> 41:49.762
We're gonna find Hugo, yeah?

41:49.764 --> 41:50.627
Come on.

41:52.331 --> 41:53.730
I think we're going to try
and find his best friend,

41:53.732 --> 41:54.696
aren't we?

41:54.698 --> 41:55.596
Yeah, do you want to do that?

41:55.598 --> 41:57.128
Where the fuck is Malik?

41:57.130 --> 41:58.196
Fuck Malik.

41:58.198 --> 41:59.096
Come on, let's go.

41:59.098 --> 42:00.395
He's a cunt anyway.

42:00.397 --> 42:01.230
Come on.

42:01.232 --> 42:02.663
Come on, let's go.

42:02.665 --> 42:05.396
We're gonna find Hugo, and
you're gonna be happy again.

42:05.398 --> 42:06.564
And, you'll be fine.

42:06.566 --> 42:10.730
Yeah make sure you give
us some space, mate.

42:10.732 --> 42:14.164
Right, now we're doing this for you.

42:14.166 --> 42:16.131
We're trying to help you
find your best friend.

42:16.133 --> 42:18.064
We're here to find Hugo, Norman.

42:18.066 --> 42:22.064
Can you tell us, hold on
a sec, just wait there.

42:22.066 --> 42:25.366
Can you tell us where
is the hidden passageway?

42:25.368 --> 42:26.231
Where is the secret?

42:26.233 --> 42:27.598
Do you know where it is?

42:27.600 --> 42:28.466
You've been here before.

42:28.468 --> 42:29.498
You've seen it before.

42:29.500 --> 42:30.531
Can you tell us, Norman?

42:30.533 --> 42:31.402
Can you?

42:32.801 --> 42:34.732
He's fucking useless.

42:34.734 --> 42:36.599
He's fucking useless.

42:36.601 --> 42:38.368
Come on, come on now.

42:41.402 --> 42:42.699
All right, Norman.

42:42.701 --> 42:46.302
Norman, oh no, we don't need him anyway.

42:49.635 --> 42:52.037
Honestly just leave him be.

42:53.369 --> 42:55.133
It's a lost cause.

43:05.304 --> 43:07.401
We can't just let him go.

43:07.403 --> 43:09.736
It's fine, leave him be.

43:09.738 --> 43:10.672
Babe, babe?

43:12.304 --> 43:15.369
It's you and I now, just the two of us.

43:15.371 --> 43:18.003
I think I know where the treasure is.

43:18.005 --> 43:20.068
Well I assume there's treasure,

43:20.070 --> 43:23.569
and if there is treasure
which I'm pretty sure there is.

43:23.571 --> 43:27.303
I think it's better just you and I.

43:27.305 --> 43:29.770
So if you come with me, I need you, right?

43:29.772 --> 43:30.637
I need you.

43:30.639 --> 43:32.170
I really need you.

43:32.172 --> 43:34.336
So if you come with me, we'll find it,

43:34.338 --> 43:36.606
and we can split it, halves.

43:39.006 --> 43:40.941
We'll be fine, come on.

43:42.507 --> 43:43.504
I need you, babe.

43:43.506 --> 43:44.438
Come on.

43:44.440 --> 43:46.271
You better lead the way.

43:46.273 --> 43:48.274
Yeah come on let's go.

43:50.340 --> 43:51.207
Come on.

43:52.340 --> 43:56.238
I reckon you go down here, you turn right.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.739
That's where the secret passage is.

43:57.741 --> 43:59.105
It's gotta be.

43:59.107 --> 44:00.305
That's the only place we haven't looked.

44:00.307 --> 44:02.439
The only place we haven't looked.

44:02.441 --> 44:04.638
I don't know Johnny.

44:04.640 --> 44:06.139
Honestly it will be fine.

44:06.141 --> 44:07.509
Come on let's go.

44:08.441 --> 44:09.473
Trust me, yeah.

44:09.475 --> 44:11.172
I'm not feeling it.

44:11.174 --> 44:12.607
I'm feeling it.

44:12.609 --> 44:14.540
I've been searching for
this my whole life, okay.

44:14.542 --> 44:16.640
I know where we're going, okay?

44:16.642 --> 44:17.607
Come on.

45:05.279 --> 45:07.177
You'll kill the poor bastard.

45:07.179 --> 45:09.311
It's much more complicated,
and much more...

45:09.313 --> 45:12.344
Well then you better start
fucking talking to me.

45:12.346 --> 45:14.614
It's a fucking long story.

45:17.014 --> 45:17.682
Okay.

45:19.481 --> 45:22.712
Johnny, my career is on the line here.

45:22.714 --> 45:24.013
This is going to be good for you.

45:24.015 --> 45:25.212
What the fuck is going on?

45:25.214 --> 45:26.313
This could be good for you, all right?

45:26.315 --> 45:27.812
It started when I was young.

45:27.814 --> 45:31.481
I remember I was walking to school,

45:31.483 --> 45:33.680
and every time I'd walked past his house,

45:33.682 --> 45:37.314
his doll was always in
the window staring at me.

45:37.316 --> 45:39.248
It felt as if it was drawing me in.

45:39.250 --> 45:41.347
I felt something.

45:41.349 --> 45:44.014
I can't explain what it was.

45:44.016 --> 45:45.515
It's crazy.

45:45.517 --> 45:48.215
I'd walk home, and he wouldn't be there.

45:48.217 --> 45:50.481
Yes obviously someone
could've just fucking moved it.

45:50.483 --> 45:52.116
But, it wasn't there anymore.

45:52.118 --> 45:53.448
But, every time I was this doll,

45:53.450 --> 45:57.218
I'd get these dreams,
these vivid nightmares.

45:59.151 --> 46:01.315
It was here, it was this place.

46:01.317 --> 46:02.548
What do you mean it was here?

46:02.550 --> 46:04.217
It was this place.

46:04.219 --> 46:05.417
I couldn't explain it.

46:05.419 --> 46:06.317
I didn't understand what was going on.

46:06.319 --> 46:08.217
I was just a child.

46:08.219 --> 46:10.249
I had absolutely no idea what was going on.

46:10.251 --> 46:12.316
Something's not right
about this place, Johnny.

46:12.318 --> 46:14.349
Yeah, you're right.

46:14.351 --> 46:16.485
Something's wrong with it.

46:17.619 --> 46:19.816
I just don't get a good feeling.

46:19.818 --> 46:21.120
No I get it.

46:22.719 --> 46:24.353
People died here.

46:25.386 --> 46:26.586
I don't know.

46:27.652 --> 46:29.617
They might have.

46:29.619 --> 46:31.118
I've done research.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.284
I found every library.

46:32.286 --> 46:34.084
I've been to every library.

46:34.086 --> 46:35.585
I've read every book.

46:35.587 --> 46:37.686
I even like hacked government files.

46:37.688 --> 46:41.755
I found this information
online about this place.

46:43.654 --> 46:45.353
Something happened here.

46:45.355 --> 46:47.487
There's an experiment.

46:47.489 --> 46:49.219
What are you talking about?

46:49.221 --> 46:51.087
What are you fucking on about?

46:51.089 --> 46:53.053
You need to start making
more sense, Johnny,

46:53.055 --> 46:55.587
because this is not what I signed up for.

46:55.589 --> 46:57.353
This is my job!

46:57.355 --> 47:00.287
I've worked too hard for this
to fucking all fall apart now.

47:00.289 --> 47:01.554
It's a real opportunity for you.

47:01.556 --> 47:02.620
It's fine.

47:02.622 --> 47:03.621
Honestly, all right?

47:03.623 --> 47:04.821
It's fine.

47:04.823 --> 47:07.687
But, I figured out what this thing was,

47:07.689 --> 47:10.087
or I think I did anyway.

47:10.089 --> 47:13.425
I went back to the house, and I broke in.

47:16.491 --> 47:17.355
Norman was there.

47:17.357 --> 47:18.554
What are you on about?

47:18.556 --> 47:20.223
Norman was there all
right, but he was young.

47:20.225 --> 47:21.092
I was 14.

47:22.758 --> 47:24.124
And, it's hazy.

47:25.824 --> 47:27.256
The doll attacked me.

47:27.258 --> 47:28.124
- What the fuck?
- It's fucked up.

47:28.126 --> 47:29.658
It sounds fucked up.

47:31.792 --> 47:32.656
Seriously.

47:32.658 --> 47:34.056
Hugo?

47:34.058 --> 47:34.759
Yeah.

47:36.459 --> 47:37.390
That's how I got this.

47:37.392 --> 47:38.324
I broke in.

47:38.326 --> 47:39.289
I was looking for the doll.

47:39.291 --> 47:40.456
I'm not understanding you.

47:40.458 --> 47:42.091
Something drew me into the doll.

47:42.093 --> 47:43.623
I got in there.

47:43.625 --> 47:44.457
I was looking for him.

47:44.459 --> 47:46.193
Norman was upstairs.

47:47.494 --> 47:50.190
This fucking doll, one
minute he wasn't here,

47:50.192 --> 47:51.192
and the next minute he was.

47:51.194 --> 47:52.191
I don't remember much after that.

47:52.193 --> 47:53.059
That's all I fucking know.

47:53.061 --> 47:54.459
Fucking mental.

47:54.461 --> 47:55.658
But, I went back.

47:55.660 --> 47:57.425
But, that's why I went back for him.

47:57.427 --> 48:00.294
This has all gone a bit far now.

48:01.428 --> 48:05.260
Yeah it is, but I need to find this place.

48:05.262 --> 48:07.092
I know there's a secret
passageway somewhere.

48:07.094 --> 48:08.192
I found it online.

48:08.194 --> 48:09.193
I found this information.

48:09.195 --> 48:10.159
It's somewhere.

48:10.161 --> 48:11.160
It's in this hall.

48:11.162 --> 48:11.827
Where?

48:11.829 --> 48:13.359
I don't fucking know.

48:13.361 --> 48:14.327
This is why I took him and Norman

48:14.329 --> 48:15.326
would be able to fucking help.

48:15.328 --> 48:17.660
It wasn't in your dream?

48:17.662 --> 48:20.161
He's the one who, oh fucking.

48:20.163 --> 48:21.260
I don't fucking know.

48:21.262 --> 48:22.661
I just need to find this place.

48:22.663 --> 48:23.660
I've been looking for
this my whole fucking life.

48:23.662 --> 48:25.763
Be my guest, after you.

48:28.196 --> 48:29.495
Where is he?

48:54.532 --> 48:56.333
Come closer.

48:59.466 --> 49:00.334
Closer!

49:07.565 --> 49:10.033
Who's the kidnapped one now?

49:22.702 --> 49:23.569
Closer.

49:33.603 --> 49:34.603
Time to die.

49:37.302 --> 49:38.401
Fuck you!

49:43.069 --> 49:44.569
You getting this?

49:49.036 --> 49:50.835
Oh my God it's daylight.

49:50.837 --> 49:52.101
We're back to the start.

49:52.103 --> 49:53.401
It's fucking daylight.

49:53.403 --> 49:55.136
We're at the beginning.

49:55.138 --> 49:56.202
Are you kidding me?

49:56.204 --> 49:57.605
For fuck's sake.

49:58.638 --> 50:00.639
Fucking hell.

50:03.338 --> 50:04.339
Oh my God.

50:05.570 --> 50:07.038
What?

50:10.671 --> 50:12.603
Look at all this stuff.

50:12.605 --> 50:14.603
What is it?

50:14.605 --> 50:16.272
This is that job.

50:17.606 --> 50:18.837
That job that all the
builders just downed tools

50:18.839 --> 50:21.037
and fucked off.

50:21.039 --> 50:23.070
They must've found the dolls.

50:23.072 --> 50:24.073
They knew.

50:25.673 --> 50:28.138
Johnny, we've gotta go back for the others.

50:28.140 --> 50:29.337
No.

50:29.339 --> 50:31.271
God, we've got to go back for the others.

50:31.273 --> 50:32.439
Sarah, no.

50:32.441 --> 50:33.638
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

50:33.640 --> 50:34.838
The entrance has to be around here.

50:34.840 --> 50:36.605
If they found them, it's
gotta be around here.

50:36.607 --> 50:37.738
What is wrong with you?

50:37.740 --> 50:39.071
We've got to go back.

50:39.073 --> 50:40.773
No, fuck them.

50:40.775 --> 50:42.172
We've already been there.

50:42.174 --> 50:43.407
We know there's nothing in there.

50:43.409 --> 50:45.641
This is fucking ridiculous.

50:47.242 --> 50:49.807
Fucking hell.

50:49.809 --> 50:51.372
Johnny.

50:59.642 --> 51:00.509
What?

51:01.642 --> 51:02.609
What is it?

51:03.642 --> 51:05.175
I don't know.

51:10.143 --> 51:12.277
It's the devil.

51:13.410 --> 51:15.141
Well what's it doing on the wall?

51:15.143 --> 51:18.243
I guess the builders put it there.

51:18.245 --> 51:19.474
Why?

51:19.476 --> 51:21.809
I don't know, but let's check it out.

51:21.811 --> 51:23.142
God.

51:36.844 --> 51:40.113
It's a fucking empty room!

51:42.678 --> 51:43.679
What's that?

51:44.546 --> 51:45.414
Nothing.

51:47.379 --> 51:51.210
I've worked too fucking
hard to lose this now.

51:51.212 --> 51:52.678
Don't make this about you.

51:52.680 --> 51:57.612
I've been looking to do
this my whole fucking life.

51:57.614 --> 51:59.446
I've been trying to find them.

51:59.448 --> 52:01.514
For fuck's sake.

52:07.149 --> 52:08.048
What is it?

52:09.782 --> 52:11.580
It's hollow.

52:11.582 --> 52:15.079
There must be a passage way behind it.

52:15.081 --> 52:15.782
In there.

52:29.215 --> 52:32.514
I don't like this Johnny.

52:32.516 --> 52:34.214
It's fine.

52:34.216 --> 52:35.382
There's nothing in there.

52:35.384 --> 52:38.049
Something's not right.

52:38.051 --> 52:40.218
It smells fucking awful.

52:44.352 --> 52:45.419
Look at this.

52:46.452 --> 52:48.549
It's the passageway.

52:48.551 --> 52:49.717
We've found it.

52:49.719 --> 52:52.549
Oh my God, he's found it.

52:52.551 --> 52:53.483
Come on then.

52:53.485 --> 52:54.382
You coming?

52:57.718 --> 53:00.250
How come no one's every found this before?

53:00.252 --> 53:02.451
It's like a maze, isn't it?

53:02.453 --> 53:05.584
A fucking labyrinth.

53:05.586 --> 53:06.454
Yep.

53:16.587 --> 53:18.652
Are you coming or what?

53:18.654 --> 53:20.552
Seriously are you coming?

53:20.554 --> 53:21.852
I don't know about this, Johnny.

53:21.854 --> 53:22.718
You're pissing me off now.

53:22.720 --> 53:24.089
You really are.

53:25.454 --> 53:27.118
Seriously if you're not gonna
come, just fucking go home.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.318
No, I'm really not sure.

53:28.320 --> 53:29.486
Just go.

53:29.488 --> 53:31.422
You're slowing me down.

53:46.424 --> 53:47.491
What is it?

53:49.256 --> 53:51.120
It's just a fucking box.

53:51.122 --> 53:52.757
Just a piece of wood.

53:58.257 --> 53:59.122
This is it.

53:59.124 --> 54:00.525
How do you know?

54:19.692 --> 54:21.559
I think we found it.

54:23.093 --> 54:24.027
This is it.

54:24.859 --> 54:26.461
This is the place.

54:27.794 --> 54:30.092
I hope these fucking
things don't come to life.

54:37.493 --> 54:39.659
Come on, there's much more to see here,

54:39.661 --> 54:40.526
Let's go.

54:40.528 --> 54:42.261
They seem so real.

54:43.226 --> 54:44.228
Wait for me.

54:59.196 --> 55:00.062
Hugo!

55:01.861 --> 55:03.561
Hugo!

55:19.363 --> 55:20.828
Hugo!

55:27.432 --> 55:29.162
Hugo!

55:40.366 --> 55:41.200
Hugo!

57:34.275 --> 57:35.476
Welcome home.

57:39.141 --> 57:40.476
My little Norman.

57:42.542 --> 57:44.209
How you have grown.

57:48.309 --> 57:51.243
Now finally I can complete my spell

57:52.743 --> 57:57.044
and send us all back, so we
can take this evil with us.

58:01.143 --> 58:02.244
Who are you?

58:04.611 --> 58:07.812
You don't remember?

58:09.145 --> 58:10.445
I have dreams.

58:12.645 --> 58:14.346
I knew you'd come.

58:15.679 --> 58:19.176
When we got Hugo back, all of us starting

58:19.178 --> 58:20.679
coming alive again.

58:23.546 --> 58:27.079
But, we just needed you, and here you are

58:29.579 --> 58:30.781
to save us all.

58:35.846 --> 58:37.148
Who are you?

58:41.847 --> 58:43.447
I'm your mother.

58:57.415 --> 58:59.247
I really don't like it.

58:59.249 --> 59:00.580
We've come this far.

59:00.582 --> 59:02.117
Don't give up now.

59:04.449 --> 59:06.514
I really think we should turn back.

59:06.516 --> 59:07.881
No.

59:07.883 --> 59:09.084
I'm going on.

59:09.850 --> 59:12.217
This isn't right, Johnny.

59:14.416 --> 59:16.682
There's something here.

59:16.684 --> 59:17.618
It's weird.

59:19.250 --> 59:21.114
And, it's pissed off at us.

59:21.116 --> 59:23.082
I'm not giving up now.

59:23.084 --> 59:25.183
If you want to, you go back.

59:25.185 --> 59:27.849
But, I'm going this direction.

59:27.851 --> 59:30.316
This is all over a fucking doll!

59:30.318 --> 59:32.716
This isn't just about the doll.

59:32.718 --> 59:34.716
This is about a mystery
that's been hidden down here

59:34.718 --> 59:36.750
for decades, and I'm
this close to figuring out

59:36.752 --> 59:37.715
what it is.

59:37.717 --> 59:39.786
Nothing is gonna stop me.

59:44.419 --> 59:45.286
Johnny!

01:00:14.888 --> 01:00:17.286
Come on Sarah, you can do this.

01:00:17.288 --> 01:00:19.222
Get your shit together.

01:00:20.823 --> 01:00:22.554
There's nothing to worry about.

01:00:22.556 --> 01:00:24.590
Oh yes there is.

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:36.122
Do I make the cut?

01:00:53.458 --> 01:00:55.792
This is gonna sting a little.

01:00:57.791 --> 01:00:59.622
Get her!

01:01:58.896 --> 01:02:00.764
I tried to save you.

01:02:03.363 --> 01:02:05.499
It was you in my dreams.

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:11.228
Something happened to Eleanor.

01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:12.464
It changed her.

01:02:14.099 --> 01:02:17.397
She was the one who read from the book.

01:02:17.399 --> 01:02:20.600
She was the one who summoned Hugo here.

01:02:27.399 --> 01:02:29.366
And, then it took me.

01:02:31.699 --> 01:02:33.266
You're changing.

01:02:34.399 --> 01:02:36.531
You're changing into one of them.

01:03:21.237 --> 01:03:23.102
How you progressing?

01:03:23.104 --> 01:03:26.203
Stage three, there are
definite abnormalities.

01:03:26.205 --> 01:03:29.135
We could go to stage two,
but no further than that.

01:03:29.137 --> 01:03:30.704
Okay look at this.

01:03:45.271 --> 01:03:49.703
Rise from the deepest,
darkest caverns of damnation

01:03:49.705 --> 01:03:52.304
through me become this vessel.

01:03:52.306 --> 01:03:54.438
Become this vessel.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.104
Make glorious your
vessels upon this household

01:03:57.106 --> 01:03:59.571
and shake a fear for these halls.

01:03:59.573 --> 01:04:01.404
Come now and be as one.

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:04.738
Eleanor, what are you doing?

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.671
Rise from the depth, and you believe in me.

01:04:06.673 --> 01:04:07.808
Please be one.

01:04:10.141 --> 01:04:10.842
Oh mother.

01:04:12.307 --> 01:04:13.142
No, no.

01:04:16.575 --> 01:04:17.439
It's already done.

01:04:21.174 --> 01:04:24.307
You have doomed us for
an eternity of damnation,

01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:26.406
an eternity of hell.

01:04:26.408 --> 01:04:27.873
No mother.

01:04:27.875 --> 01:04:30.307
I'm already been living in hell.

01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:32.307
Don't you understand, mom?

01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:35.143
He came to me, and he spoke to me.

01:04:36.843 --> 01:04:38.841
He's not yet complete.

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:44.309
Oh Norman.

01:04:48.711 --> 01:04:51.775
Now we have a chance to save everyone

01:04:51.777 --> 01:04:54.844
and put Hugo back where he came from.

01:04:57.344 --> 01:04:58.211
How?

01:05:00.611 --> 01:05:04.079
You must say these words from the book,

01:05:05.212 --> 01:05:07.646
say these words, fire and inferno.

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:20.178
Hello mama, Mommy's all done now.

01:06:04.717 --> 01:06:05.785
This is it.

01:06:31.385 --> 01:06:32.816
Norman?

01:06:32.818 --> 01:06:33.686
Norman?

01:06:38.253 --> 01:06:40.318
What is this place, Norman?

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.618
What is the secret?

01:06:44.787 --> 01:06:45.854
What are you?

01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:48.151
What is the secret?

01:06:48.153 --> 01:06:49.252
Secrets?

01:06:49.254 --> 01:06:51.088
Yes, I need to know.

01:06:52.254 --> 01:06:54.919
I've been searching for you my whole life.

01:06:54.921 --> 01:06:56.219
Is it immortality?

01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:57.751
Immortality.

01:06:57.753 --> 01:07:00.088
I need to know the secret.

01:07:01.855 --> 01:07:03.253
It's not a secret, Johnny.

01:07:03.255 --> 01:07:04.121
It's a curse.

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:06.789
Curse it is.

01:07:08.556 --> 01:07:09.919
Tell me.

01:07:09.921 --> 01:07:11.887
Tell me everything.

01:07:11.889 --> 01:07:13.221
Eleanor my darling,

01:07:13.223 --> 01:07:16.557
do you think he's ready to know everything?

01:07:17.856 --> 01:07:21.753
I don't think his tiny
little brain could take it.

01:07:21.755 --> 01:07:25.121
Oh Hugo, I think he knows way too much.

01:07:25.123 --> 01:07:27.454
I think it's time we say bye-bye Johnny.

01:07:29.523 --> 01:07:31.889
No, only Norman could do that,

01:07:31.891 --> 01:07:35.655
and he's a blabbering pile of mush.

01:07:38.158 --> 01:07:40.726
Meet mother by the way.

01:07:44.492 --> 01:07:47.726
Oh fuck, I don't understand.

01:07:49.659 --> 01:07:52.757
The stories I've been told are different.

01:07:52.759 --> 01:07:55.357
Oh please tell, Johnny,
we're all listening.

01:07:55.359 --> 01:07:57.857
You and your family were working

01:07:57.859 --> 01:08:00.825
on a top secret government experiment,

01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:03.524
but this was no ordinary experiment.

01:08:03.526 --> 01:08:06.724
There were no men in
white coats, no test tubes.

01:08:06.726 --> 01:08:08.624
This was witchcraft.

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:09.559
The government wanted you to create

01:08:09.561 --> 01:08:11.458
a super human hybrid.

01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.492
You used mannequins as test subjects.

01:08:13.494 --> 01:08:14.825
Witchcraft?

01:08:14.827 --> 01:08:18.359
This all sounds a little fantastical to me.

01:08:18.361 --> 01:08:22.327
But, do go on, old boy,
as I find you most amusing.

01:08:22.328 --> 01:08:26.496
But, something went wrong,
something unexpected,

01:08:27.495 --> 01:08:28.694
something evil.

01:08:29.895 --> 01:08:32.660
Oh Johnny, we've been
rotting here for decades

01:08:32.662 --> 01:08:35.227
slowly away with the rest of the walls.

01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:36.161
Boo.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:40.229
What really happened?

01:08:42.196 --> 01:08:43.863
Well Hugo happened.

01:08:45.163 --> 01:08:48.328
I hated living in this shit hole.

01:08:48.331 --> 01:08:50.127
I was told that it was top secret,

01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:52.130
and we were never allowed out or to have

01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:55.229
any communication with the outside world.

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:58.694
Do you know what that's
like for a teenager?

01:08:58.697 --> 01:09:01.697
I just wanted them to die,
just something to happen,

01:09:01.698 --> 01:09:03.696
so I could go out an play.

01:09:08.233 --> 01:09:09.666
But, then he came.

01:09:11.533 --> 01:09:14.197
Well the voice in my head.

01:09:14.198 --> 01:09:16.397
He just told me what to do
and how to read mother's book,

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:18.564
and well he'd come and save me.

01:09:20.234 --> 01:09:21.068
Demon?

01:09:26.533 --> 01:09:30.398
Well Johnny you see, my mother was meddling

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:35.166
with witchcraft so powerful,
and it worked very well.

01:09:35.167 --> 01:09:39.564
So I just tapped into it,
and well Hugo was the result.

01:09:41.167 --> 01:09:42.765
But, then Norman got away with Hugo

01:09:42.768 --> 01:09:44.465
before I can even finish and complete it.

01:09:44.466 --> 01:09:46.732
And, it was only half done.

01:09:46.734 --> 01:09:49.134
Thank you for bringing
him back to me Johnny.

01:09:49.136 --> 01:09:51.800
I can finally finish what I completed now.

01:09:54.503 --> 01:09:56.401
And, what are you gonna do?

01:09:56.403 --> 01:09:59.667
Oh Johnny, you don't
think Hugo's the only demon

01:09:59.669 --> 01:10:00.768
I can summon.

01:10:02.769 --> 01:10:04.468
That's right, my dear.

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:06.701
I have a very big family.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:09.701
And, they all want to come and play.

01:10:14.605 --> 01:10:16.735
Norman, come on get up.

01:10:16.737 --> 01:10:18.736
Get up and do something.

01:10:18.738 --> 01:10:20.303
That's right, Norman.

01:10:20.305 --> 01:10:21.769
Always the weak link.

01:10:21.771 --> 01:10:25.269
Just look at you, you
fucking useless tub of meat.

01:10:25.271 --> 01:10:26.503
You fool.

01:10:26.505 --> 01:10:29.706
I'm laughing at your superior intellect.

01:10:31.239 --> 01:10:34.440
By Jove, I never knew he had it in him.

01:10:37.607 --> 01:10:41.140
I never knew my mother untill just now.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.138
You took her from me, but she told me

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.541
these three words.

01:10:48.708 --> 01:10:50.638
Fire and inferno.

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.439
Oh shit.

01:11:13.542 --> 01:11:15.543
Let's get out of here.

01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:32.579
We're all right.

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:33.549
We're safe.

01:12:35.383 --> 01:12:37.181
You're okay now.

01:12:43.883 --> 01:12:45.117
Yeah, I am.
