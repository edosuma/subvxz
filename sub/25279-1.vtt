WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:10.051
What the hell?

00:10.635 --> 00:13.555
You can't cancel the pipeline
'cause of some protesters.

00:13.638 --> 00:15.557
[stammers] That... No, we had a deal.

00:15.640 --> 00:19.602
Unfortunately, they can back out
for any reason.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.354
The contract says that.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.481
Well, nobody reads the contracts.

00:25.024 --> 00:28.820
Why do you think I still belong
to a 24 Hour Fitness in Orlando?

00:30.196 --> 00:31.865
If you're caving to protesters,

00:31.948 --> 00:33.825
I'll chain Colt to a tree right now.

00:35.744 --> 00:36.661
Can't you talk to somebody?

00:36.745 --> 00:38.455
Believe me. I tried.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.831
They don't care.

00:39.914 --> 00:42.500
They're sending me
to another project in North Dakota.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.210
No.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.337
No, we were countin' on this.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.758
We used our operatin' money
to buy the Peterson Ranch.

00:51.509 --> 00:54.596
Dad's gonna kill us.
And the news will kill him.

00:56.097 --> 01:00.018
I thought we'd die together
fighting them Northside Koreans.

01:02.687 --> 01:03.605
Guys...

01:04.689 --> 01:07.275
I feel truly awful about this.

01:07.358 --> 01:09.903
I knew it.
I knew we shouldn't have done it.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.823
All... All right.
Let's go talk to Peterson.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.659
We'll explain things,
and he'll let us out of the deal.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.453
Pass our problem on to someone else.

01:18.536 --> 01:19.621
It's the American way.

01:21.456 --> 01:24.793
I'll grab the keys.
Let's go there before it's too late.

01:25.293 --> 01:26.211
[Colt] Fuck!

01:27.962 --> 01:30.089
He wanted that Peterson place bad.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.090
[loud thud]

01:31.174 --> 01:32.175
[Colt] Fuck!

01:33.593 --> 01:35.929
He hurt his hand punching the wall.

01:37.972 --> 01:42.143
Look, I really am sorry.
I know how awful this is.

01:42.644 --> 01:43.561
Yeah.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.313
It's not your fault.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.067
So, you're off to North Dakota?

01:49.150 --> 01:54.864
Yeah, for the next four months I'll be
at the Brown Bison Inn and Western Wear.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.993
I can choose between a continental
breakfast or a free pair of spurs.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.705
When do you leave?

02:03.331 --> 02:04.165
Tomorrow.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.252
-Shit.
-Yeah.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.838
Well, we had a good run.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.339
Yeah, we did.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.384
It was, like, four days, but okay.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.221
You're my second longest relationship.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.769
I'll always wonder
what a Thursday with you would be like.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.398
I gotta get going.

02:33.403 --> 02:37.157
I never thought I'd say this
about a guy named Rooster...

02:38.700 --> 02:40.034
but I'll miss you.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.503
-Hey, Jen?
-Yeah?

02:51.212 --> 02:53.047
You should go for the spurs.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.844
Might come in useful
if you're ever back in town.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.056
You know, for sex.

03:02.557 --> 03:03.808
[laughs]

03:05.435 --> 03:06.352
Bye, Rooster.

03:13.651 --> 03:14.861
-You good?
-No.

03:17.989 --> 03:18.865
All right.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.329
Yeah, well, Colt,
I just got to Denver, okay?

03:24.412 --> 03:26.497
I've got a ton of crap to do.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.208
I gotta unpack,
and I just went to the store.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.962
I don't have time to argue with you

03:33.046 --> 03:36.049
about the same stuff
over and over and over again.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.801
I can't deal with it now.
A lot is going on.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.386
I'll call you back later.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.268
[theme song playing]

04:50.415 --> 04:51.499
[Rooster] Mr. Peterson?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.084
-Hey.
-[Colt] Hey.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.502
Hey, boys.

04:55.086 --> 04:58.214
I got a bag of Big Macs here
if you're hungry.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.843
I just wanted to have
some real American food

05:01.926 --> 05:03.594
before I went to Thailand.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.138
Also...

05:05.722 --> 05:07.432
I'm really high.

05:07.515 --> 05:08.850
[Colt and Rooster chuckle]

05:09.517 --> 05:10.727
We're good.

05:11.227 --> 05:14.731
We just wanted to talk to you
about buying your ranch.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.693
I'll never sell my ranch.

05:20.111 --> 05:23.197
You can take your Big Macs
and get off my property.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.451
Hey, Mr. Peterson, actually...

05:26.534 --> 05:28.244
Remember? We already bought it.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.287
Oh...

05:30.246 --> 05:31.372
That's right.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.668
That brain cancer weed...

05:36.169 --> 05:38.254
That's the top-shelf stuff.

05:38.337 --> 05:39.255
[Colt chuckles]

05:40.006 --> 05:41.883
Yeah, here's the thing. We...

05:43.217 --> 05:46.429
We feel bad about buying this place
for so much less

05:46.512 --> 05:48.181
-than Neumann's Hill's offer.
-Oh.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.975
Yeah, that money could do you some good.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.352
You're going to Thailand. You can...

05:54.062 --> 05:55.354
You can buy a monkey.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.776
Turn him into your monkey butler.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.863
We don't wanna steal from you.

06:03.946 --> 06:07.075
Leave that to the hot chick
that marries you right before you die.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.076
[Rooster chuckles]

06:08.826 --> 06:11.662
P.S., if you meet her in Thailand,
check under the hood.

06:11.746 --> 06:12.580
[Colt] Oh, yeah.

06:12.663 --> 06:15.291
-Make sure she don't have a third leg.
-[Colt whistles]

06:17.085 --> 06:18.169
[Colt] Point is...

06:18.920 --> 06:20.963
you should take the Neumann's Hill deal.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.799
That's not happening.

06:22.882 --> 06:23.966
Well, why not?

06:24.050 --> 06:26.010
Right after we closed our deal,

06:26.469 --> 06:28.554
I sent them an email declining their offer

06:28.638 --> 06:33.434
and calling them a bunch of
soulless corporate vampire cocksuckers.

06:33.935 --> 06:34.894
[Rooster clicks tongue]

06:35.686 --> 06:38.564
Okay, well that screws us,
but goddamn respect.

06:39.148 --> 06:41.526
Actually, there was a typo,

06:41.609 --> 06:44.654
and I called them "cooksuckers."

06:46.114 --> 06:48.199
Always proofread, boys.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.868
[Rooster sighs] Oh, man.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.078
[Colt] Mr. Peterson...

06:53.663 --> 06:55.039
I'll level with you.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.167
The pipeline fell through.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.214
We don't have the money to buy this place.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.592
Oh, Christ, I'm sorry.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.221
That's like on <i>Wheel.</i>

07:11.180 --> 07:15.226
When you win a trip to Tahiti,
and the next spin is "bankrupt."

07:16.018 --> 07:18.646
Sajak's sitting in the corner, smiling.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.691
That smug piece of shit.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.989
Our backs are up against
the wall here, Mr. Peterson.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.240
We gotta get out of this deal.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.034
I'd love to help you out, boys,

07:32.785 --> 07:35.538
but I already told my son
I'd help him buy a house.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.833
And I started a college fund
for my grandson.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.210
Although, college may be a reach.

07:42.044 --> 07:44.005
Yeah, they got a paste-eater.

07:45.923 --> 07:49.177
All right, well,
that's the final nail in our coffin.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.304
[snaps fingers] That reminds me.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.639
I gotta buy a coffin.

07:55.016 --> 07:55.892
Hey!

07:56.434 --> 07:59.145
Why don't you two
just sell it to Neumann's Hill?

08:01.647 --> 08:02.690
Why didn't we think of that?

08:03.524 --> 08:06.736
Maybe we was too busy
thinking 'bout that monkey butler.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.780
You still got your old boss' number?

08:09.864 --> 08:10.740
Rich?

08:11.407 --> 08:14.535
I mean, last time I saw him
he called me a terrible employee,

08:14.619 --> 08:17.038
and I smashed his phone into the wall.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.081
But I never called him a cocksucker.
I'll give him a call.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.877
-Thank you.
-Yeah, thank you.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.212
-Good luck, boys.
-Yeah.

08:24.295 --> 08:28.966
By the way, I'll give you
20 bucks for your McDonald's.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.552
-Actually, these are--
-That's fair. We'll take it.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.813
You okay over there?
You haven't said much, even for you.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.233
Just enjoying the beautiful scenery.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.612
Okay, well, that's fucking weird.

08:51.113 --> 08:54.033
Gotta admit,
I'm not a big fan of the Kiwanis Club,

08:54.116 --> 08:57.954
but they've done a bang-up job
adopting this highway.

08:59.956 --> 09:03.209
How high are you
on a scale from one to Willie Nelson?

09:05.461 --> 09:07.046
It's not the pills, Joanne.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.924
When I closed my eyes for that operation,

09:10.007 --> 09:12.510
I didn't know if I'd ever open them again.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.013
And I feel like I got a second chance.

09:18.182 --> 09:21.185
Maybe the reason for that
is to spend it with you.

09:23.354 --> 09:27.024
Waiting for you to get out of surgery
was the longest three hours of my life.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.527
Hell, I appreciate you being there for me.

09:30.987 --> 09:36.367
And now that I've got this second chance,
I'm done worrying about the little stuff.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.663
That's probably what put me
in the hospital in the first place.

09:40.746 --> 09:41.581
That and...

09:42.164 --> 09:46.836
the only time your mouth wasn't full
of steak was when you'd dump whisky in it.

09:47.878 --> 09:52.174
See, that little joke there is a thing
that I'm not gonna let bother me.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.429
I guess with this new attitude of yours...

09:57.346 --> 10:00.266
I guess you're okay with me driving
you home in this Chevy?

10:01.809 --> 10:02.768
[Joanne chuckles]

10:02.852 --> 10:05.062
Ride's so smooth,

10:05.146 --> 10:08.691
I can see why Don McLean
drove one of these to the levee.

10:12.987 --> 10:17.700
Abby, just 'cause I don't want you moving
to Denver don't mean I'm not supportive.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.827
I shouldn't have to apologize for that.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.497
Fine, I'm sorry.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.250
[mouthing] I'm not sorry.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.088
Well, I'm glad you're sorry, too.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.174
We'll talk about this more
when you're done with school

10:33.257 --> 10:34.925
and you got a better attitude.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.013
When'd she hang up?

10:39.597 --> 10:41.015
Right after I apologized.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.061
[Rooster] All right, there's Rich.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.604
He's the last shot, so be cool.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.190
How you wanna play this?
Good cop, bad cop?

10:49.774 --> 10:51.317
How 'bout good cop, shut-the-fuck-up cop?

10:53.402 --> 10:56.322
Hey! What's up, Rich?
You're lookin' good, man.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.157
Nice jacket. How do I get one?

10:58.240 --> 10:59.784
You don't get fired from Neumann's Hill.

10:59.867 --> 11:00.701
[chuckles]

11:01.661 --> 11:04.038
-Remember my brother?
-Of course. Good to see you again.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.956
Get outta here with this. I'm a hugger.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.293
Okay, okay.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.796
Jiminy Christmas, you smell good.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.758
What's that? What is that?
Old Spice Bearglove?

11:17.051 --> 11:18.552
Ah! Good call.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.847
What you got goin' on?
I got a hint of mango shampoo.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.684
-It's mango coconut.
-Mmm.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.606
It's subtle. That coconut will hit you
on the drive home.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.861
In case you guys were wondering,
sweat, Budweiser, and KFC.

11:37.571 --> 11:38.447
[Colt] Let's sit.

11:40.074 --> 11:44.453
So, what is this business proposition
that is "better than a blewjob"?

11:47.164 --> 11:48.916
Dude! You didn't proofread.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.337
All right, look, Rich,

11:53.421 --> 11:56.507
we know Neumann's Hill wants
to buy the Peterson Ranch.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.176
Yeah, until some asshole bought it
from underneath us.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.263
Rich, you're looking
straight at that asshole.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.350
So you guys bought it?

12:06.976 --> 12:08.352
[Colt and Rooster chuckle]

12:10.438 --> 12:12.815
Why do you wanna sell it the next day?

12:13.399 --> 12:15.401
Everyone knows Peterson hates you guys.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.735
He sold it to us super cheap.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.155
We don't have time to run two ranches.

12:19.238 --> 12:24.076
We're, like, investors, you know?
Like Mark Cuban or Scrooge McDuck.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.371
Scrooge McDuck?

12:28.497 --> 12:30.666
He's got a room full of gold, Rich.

12:31.917 --> 12:32.793
Do you?

12:34.044 --> 12:36.589
We ain't looking to gouge you here.

12:36.672 --> 12:40.259
So, why not just offer us
what you was offerin' Peterson?

12:41.719 --> 12:44.680
Throw in a few of those jackets.
Everyone's happy.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.267
Guys, they wanted it last week.
I don't see why they wouldn't want it now.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.727
-[Colt] All right.
-All right, well...

12:49.810 --> 12:51.312
Talk to 'em, let us know what they say.

12:51.395 --> 12:54.899
And then, if we buy the place,
you can come back and run it for us.

12:56.066 --> 12:59.236
That's cool,
but I got a good job right now, so...

12:59.320 --> 13:00.154
Wait.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.572
-You think I'm serious.
-[Colt chuckles]

13:05.826 --> 13:09.455
-Do you know what is wrong with this guy?
-[laughing and stammering]

13:09.538 --> 13:10.456
He's...

13:10.539 --> 13:11.415
He's an idiot.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.167
I don't know what... Yeah!

13:13.250 --> 13:16.504
We're still friends, right?
We got that Bearglove love.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.631
[Colt chuckles]

13:20.508 --> 13:21.759
-[Colt] This is good.
-Yeah.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.636
This is really good.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.347
My head don't just smell good.
It thinks good.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.891
Yeah, your head thinks real good.

13:30.518 --> 13:31.644
Best part, when we tell Dad,

13:31.727 --> 13:33.521
he can't get pissed,
'cause we already solved the problem.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.564
[Colt] Whoa. Whoa.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.025
We ain't sayin' nothin'
till the deal closes.

13:38.108 --> 13:41.278
We gotta tell him about the pipeline.
He'll see it in the paper.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.949
It's not a report card,
where we can turn every letter into a C.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.493
[Colt] All right.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.414
We tell him about the pipeline,
but nothin' else.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.875
You know, the man just had a heart attack.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.210
Yeah, okay.

13:56.293 --> 13:57.878
We're not lying to him.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.339
-We're looking out for him.
-That's right. Man...

14:01.006 --> 14:02.424
we are such good people.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.224
Another beer and a shot,
and I'll race you home.

14:10.307 --> 14:11.183
All right.

14:14.478 --> 14:15.938
If you guys ever need it,

14:16.522 --> 14:18.023
I'm an Uber driver now.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.240
All right, doctor said no more red meat.

14:26.323 --> 14:27.950
Don't throw those steaks away!

14:28.033 --> 14:29.785
I'm not. I'm taking 'em.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.163
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.081
Hey.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.249
How was the ride home?

14:35.332 --> 14:36.876
It was great.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.588
Okay, that's fucking weird.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.300
Yeah, he's a new man.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.887
My granddaughter left some Pop Rocks
in the truck and he ate 'em.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.764
They were tingly.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.562
I gotta get back to my shift
at the Cracker Barrel.

14:56.645 --> 14:57.563
He's all yours.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.857
Doctor says not to let him get riled up.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.859
Got it. So no Anderson Cooper.

15:03.819 --> 15:04.737
Bye, guys.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.363
-Bye.
-Bye.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.367
You wanna watch TV?

15:10.451 --> 15:12.870
I can put a John Wayne movie on for you.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.289
Or we could just sit and talk.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.251
Wow.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.755
You've turned into the guy I always
wanted you to be and I hate it.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.009
You always said I was such an asshole.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.219
Well, you were.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.346
But I liked it.

15:30.846 --> 15:33.265
It got us out of a lot of boring parties.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.102
[imitating Beau] "This party sucks.
We're leavin'."

15:39.021 --> 15:42.942
Yeah, your sister never forgave me
for doing that at her wedding.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.739
[Colt] There he is!

15:48.822 --> 15:49.949
[Rooster] Hey.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.659
Holy shit. Are you smilin'?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.788
Can't a dad just be happy to see his sons?

15:57.164 --> 15:58.624
Yeah, but not our dad.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.169
How are you feelin', Pops?

16:02.753 --> 16:04.880
Every day above ground is a good day.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.716
Well, that's just fucking weird.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.220
How were things while I was gone?

16:12.012 --> 16:13.347
-Good.
-It's good.

16:14.556 --> 16:15.849
It was great.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.643
[stammers] Great... It was really great.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.604
-There was one thing.
-A small thing.

16:20.688 --> 16:21.563
-Super small.
-Tiny.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.731
[Maggie] Oh, shit.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.235
Last time you two
had this look on your face,

16:26.318 --> 16:28.320
you killed the Norwood High mascot.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.365
I am not burying another goat.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.159
Nobody died. It's just, um...

16:35.661 --> 16:37.162
That pipeline fell through.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.707
We ain't getting none of that money.

16:40.582 --> 16:41.417
All right.

16:44.086 --> 16:44.920
That's it?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.840
We've done fine without it.
Wasn't meant to be.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.927
Well, that is a great attitude, Dad.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.515
Where was this Beau
when they canceled<i> Coach?</i>

16:58.392 --> 17:00.269
Anything else I should know about?

17:01.145 --> 17:03.439
-[Colt blows raspberry] Uh...
-[Rooster] Uh...

17:04.314 --> 17:05.566
-Nothing, nothing...
-[Colt mumbles]

17:05.649 --> 17:06.483
Nothing I can think of.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.736
-I'm racking my brain.
-Colt, you got any...

17:08.819 --> 17:10.696
We got... We got the pipeline.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.906
-[Rooster] Pipeline fell through.
-It's...

17:12.990 --> 17:15.159
-[Colt] Ranch is good.
-[Rooster] Ranch looks good.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.202
-Trump said some stupid shit.
-Yeah.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.706
[Colt] Nah, that's... Everything's good.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.124
I'm happy you're home.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.420
Yeah, actually, there is one more thing.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.590
I love you, Daddy.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.594
[chuckles] Hey, there's that frown.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.603
How'd it go over at Peterson's?

17:43.187 --> 17:45.856
I checked the fence. Cows look good.

17:46.815 --> 17:48.067
Everything looks good.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.988
-Man, that's one nice piece of land.
-Yeah.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.573
Maybe we should look into buying it.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.576
Wait. You did, and it ruined us.

17:59.578 --> 18:02.331
I'm just giving you shit.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.626
I thought Abby and I would raise
our family there.

18:07.461 --> 18:10.422
Well, now you don't got a ranch or Abby.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.966
Whoa. Come on. We didn't break up.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.761
She just moved to a different city
and won't return my calls or texts.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.934
All right. Gotta be Rich.
I hope he's got good news.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.395
I haven't been so nervous since
we got stopped with a goat in our trunk.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.691
-Hey, guys.
-'Sup, Rich?

18:30.943 --> 18:31.777
Bring it in.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.737
We're huggin' in the woods. All right.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.534
Hey. Hey, I even got you something.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.963
-"Midnight Mango Coconut" shampoo.
-[laughing]

18:51.046 --> 18:54.007
They keep it in the girls' section,
but that's for anyone.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.009
Anyone with a vagina.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.763
So, Rich, you got some news or what?

19:00.556 --> 19:02.724
-They want the ranch.
-Fuck yeah! Whoo!

19:02.808 --> 19:04.393
Ha, ha! Hey, look. I'm a large.

19:04.476 --> 19:05.477
He's an extra-large.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.147
And here is the offer.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.439
Oh, jeez.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.192
I feel like I'm getting an ESPY.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.194
All right. And the winner is...

19:17.531 --> 19:18.615
What the hell?

19:18.699 --> 19:21.034
I... I know it's less
than you were hoping for.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.245
This is less than we paid for it.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.331
-It's less than we owe on the place.
-That's what they're willing to give you.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.000
That's an opening offer, right?

19:28.083 --> 19:29.001
Now we counter?

19:29.084 --> 19:32.379
How about twice as much as that?
So, that would be...

19:32.462 --> 19:34.506
I won't insult you.
You can do the basic math.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.302
Guys, they know you're in trouble
or else you wouldn't be selling.

19:39.469 --> 19:40.804
This is bullshit.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.433
If we accept this,
we can't even pay back the bank.

19:44.516 --> 19:48.061
And then they'll come for Iron River,
and we'll have nothing.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.104
If you don't accept,

19:49.188 --> 19:51.481
they'll wait till you go under
and buy it from the bank.

19:52.065 --> 19:53.317
Is this 'cause they don't like me?

19:53.400 --> 19:55.903
[chuckles] Neumann's Hill
barely knows who you are.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.530
Their business is to buy
at the lowest price,

19:58.614 --> 20:00.324
and they're really, really good at it.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.910
You know what wasn't purchased
at the lowest price?

20:03.493 --> 20:05.287
This shampoo, you son of a bitch.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.042
I'm sorry. I wish I had better news.

20:11.251 --> 20:12.252
See you later.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.268
[hammering]

20:35.817 --> 20:38.946
You should be taking it easy,
not moving fridges.

20:39.529 --> 20:42.950
This thing has been buzzing for ten years,
and I fixed it.

20:43.033 --> 20:46.078
Then I sat down to read,
and it was too quiet.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.998
Now I can't get it to buzz again.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.002
Beau, sit.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.675
They say sitting too much
gives you a heart attack.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.469
Then you have one,
and they tell you to sit.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.514
It makes no sense.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.517
Did this chair just squeak?

21:11.520 --> 21:12.896
-[Maggie] Hey, boys.
-[Rooster] Hey, hey.

21:12.980 --> 21:13.897
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.733
[Colt] We need to talk to you.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.861
Okay, let's just cut to the chase.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.697
Fire, bail, or pregnancy?

21:23.532 --> 21:26.535
Whatever it is,
I'm done sweatin' the small stuff,

21:26.618 --> 21:28.662
and it is all small stuff.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.708
[inhales deeply]
That's a great attitude, Daddy.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.503
I hope you keep that in mind
when Colt tells you what he did.

21:39.047 --> 21:39.881
All right.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.884
There's no easy way to say it, so...

21:45.262 --> 21:46.513
I'll just tell you.

21:51.643 --> 21:52.769
While you were in the hospital,

21:52.853 --> 21:55.647
we used your power of attorney
to buy the Peterson Ranch.

21:56.690 --> 21:57.733
What?

21:57.816 --> 22:00.694
We only did it 'cause we thought
the pipeline money was coming.

22:02.446 --> 22:06.908
When it fell through, we tried to
back out, but, uh... they wouldn't let us.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.455
We tried to sell to Neumann's Hill,
but they lowballed us.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.957
How did you even get the down payment?

22:15.709 --> 22:18.086
We used this year's operatin' money.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.129
[Maggie gasps]

22:23.133 --> 22:26.219
-Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?
-Jesus Christ.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.389
We only did it because we thought--

22:29.473 --> 22:30.515
Bullshit!

22:31.933 --> 22:33.769
You're incapable of thinkin'.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.938
I worked this ranch my whole life.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.692
I'm gone for two days,
and you bring it to its goddamn knees.

22:43.987 --> 22:46.656
I'd have been better off if I'd died
on that fucking table.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.574
[Colt] Dad...

22:51.536 --> 22:53.789
Mom, come on. You gotta understand.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.708
How could you two be so stupid?

22:57.793 --> 23:00.045
It may not look like it,
but we had a plan.

23:00.629 --> 23:04.633
Your dad gave himself a heart attack,
running this place for you.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.260
He could have died
while you were going behind his back.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.679
There was a deadline.
We had to make a call.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.641
He made that call.
He said he didn't want to do it.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.478
I can't believe your selfishness.

23:26.738 --> 23:27.989
We'll fix it.

23:28.740 --> 23:32.202
-We'll keep our heads down--
-Will you shut the fuck up?

23:32.786 --> 23:33.995
What?

23:35.330 --> 23:36.998
Dad didn't wanna do this.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.835
I didn't wanna do this.

23:40.502 --> 23:41.545
Whoa.

23:42.754 --> 23:46.299
No one held a gun against your head
when you signed that contract.

23:47.634 --> 23:51.346
I had to sign...
because Dad doesn't trust you.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.266
I shouldn't have trusted you either.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.768
Everything you touch turns to shit.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.815
I was just trying to do
what's best for the family.

24:02.482 --> 24:04.359
That is bullshit, Colt.

24:04.442 --> 24:06.027
You only care about you.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.157
You wanted Abby. You didn't care
what it would do to Kenny.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.742
You go hook up with Heather.
You don't care what it'll do to Abby.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.537
You wanted the Peterson Ranch.

24:16.204 --> 24:17.414
You just cost us everything.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.126
And you're perfect?

24:22.043 --> 24:25.172
You bail on Dad to take a job
you get fired from.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.007
You almost get Mom's bar shut down.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.050
You fuck up every relationship
you've ever been in.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.136
You know what really
would've helped the family?

24:31.803 --> 24:32.762
Huh?

24:33.930 --> 24:35.432
If you'd never come home.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.733
[soft country music playing]
