00:12.747 --> 00:14.146
This week on Vice:

00:14.181 --> 00:17.682
groundbreaking innovations
in managing autism.

00:17.717 --> 00:19.884
Hey! Hey, Rey!

00:19.920 --> 00:21.553
They're trying to shut down channels

00:21.588 --> 00:23.988
'cause the world is really overwhelming.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.924
I just can't take it.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.360
It really was like somebody
had turned off a switch.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.962
It was as if he was
looking right through me.

00:30.997 --> 00:33.698
So, in our lifetimes,
will a child with autism

00:33.733 --> 00:35.466
be able to walk into the hospital,

00:35.501 --> 00:37.735
and walk out without autistic behaviors?

00:37.771 --> 00:40.872
For some of them, I... I
believe this is totally possible.

00:47.814 --> 00:48.979
Go, go, go!

00:51.884 --> 00:53.350
We are not animals!

01:04.964 --> 01:06.697
Autism spectrum diagnoses

01:06.732 --> 01:09.399
have been on a steep
rise in recent years.

01:09.434 --> 01:11.868
In fact, according to the CDC,

01:11.904 --> 01:14.605
one in 68 American children born today

01:14.640 --> 01:16.707
has autism in some form.

01:16.742 --> 01:19.042
Now because of this,
the scientific community

01:19.078 --> 01:22.178
is marshaling major resources
to figure out the origins

01:22.214 --> 01:24.647
of the condition and how to treat it.

01:28.052 --> 01:32.355
Back and dinosaur story! Four! Five...

01:39.998 --> 01:41.563
We're in front of the Rebecca School

01:41.599 --> 01:43.699
in the middle of Midtown Manhattan.

01:43.735 --> 01:45.868
And we're here to meet some kids,

01:45.903 --> 01:48.403
all different ages, who all have autism.

01:48.439 --> 01:51.707
One, two! One, two, three, four!

02:04.721 --> 02:07.356
What's the experience of
being in this classroom

02:07.391 --> 02:09.625
or being on the street
for these children?

02:09.660 --> 02:11.826
Most of these kids don't have

02:11.862 --> 02:15.229
an integrated sense of the world,

02:15.265 --> 02:16.597
so it's a fractured experience.

02:16.633 --> 02:19.868
So, you wonder why kids walk around
with their fingers in their ears...

02:19.903 --> 02:21.970
- Mm-hmm.
- ... or they cover their eyes, or...

02:22.005 --> 02:24.839
It's because they're
trying to shut down channels

02:24.875 --> 02:26.975
'cause the world is really overwhelming.

02:27.010 --> 02:30.244
If you don't know what
the important data is,

02:30.280 --> 02:31.979
everything might be important.

02:32.014 --> 02:34.560
So, a car horn might actually be

02:34.565 --> 02:36.080
the thing you have to pay attention to.

02:36.118 --> 02:38.653
Or the humming of a light bulb

02:38.688 --> 02:40.754
might be the thing you
have to pay attention to.

02:40.790 --> 02:43.357
If you can't figure
out what's important,

02:43.393 --> 02:44.992
you have to pay attention to everything.

02:45.027 --> 02:47.527
- I can't see!
- I can't see!

02:49.699 --> 02:51.865
Oh! Oh, hey! Hey!

02:51.901 --> 02:53.433
- Hey, Rey!
- What?

02:53.468 --> 02:55.468
- Look!
- Do I sit over here?

02:55.504 --> 02:56.937
No, no, no, no. Look.

02:56.972 --> 02:58.906
- You seen this?
- Over here!

02:58.941 --> 03:01.140
No, these!

03:01.176 --> 03:04.544
- Look.
- Who are these people?

03:04.580 --> 03:08.147
I actually have no idea.

03:08.183 --> 03:10.783
Sol is one of those guys

03:10.819 --> 03:13.653
who is always regulated up here.

03:13.689 --> 03:15.154
Everything happens quickly.

03:15.190 --> 03:16.923
What he doesn't have a chance to do

03:16.958 --> 03:20.193
is really process what
he's gonna put back out.

03:20.228 --> 03:23.529
I can't believe I
need to be on the show.

03:23.564 --> 03:25.464
What would your show be called, Sol?

03:25.499 --> 03:27.133
I have no idea.

03:27.168 --> 03:28.267
What would it be called?

03:28.302 --> 03:31.403
Have you seen the movie called
Kubo and the Two Strings?

03:31.439 --> 03:33.139
I haven't seen that movie.

03:33.174 --> 03:35.708
What about Iron Man 3?

03:35.743 --> 03:37.476
Oh, yeah. That's a good one.

03:37.511 --> 03:39.345
Did you see that movie?

03:39.380 --> 03:40.879
I did. Did you?

03:40.914 --> 03:43.215
- Yes!
- The movie guru.

03:43.251 --> 03:45.451
I'm not movie guru!

03:45.486 --> 03:48.120
Like the expert.

03:57.564 --> 03:58.563
I am not a mo...

03:58.598 --> 03:59.998
I am not an expert, okay?

04:00.033 --> 04:01.299
Don't call me that!

04:04.537 --> 04:07.338
- I just can't take it.
- I know you can't take it.

04:08.239 --> 04:10.139
_

04:12.345 --> 04:14.211
Can you please help me? I'm stuck.

04:14.247 --> 04:16.281
Are you ready? Grab on, grab on.

04:16.315 --> 04:17.582
Grab on, grab on.

04:17.617 --> 04:20.184
Grab on.

04:20.219 --> 04:21.819
You're free.

04:21.853 --> 04:24.188
Oh. Way to go.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.990
Thank you! You did it!

04:26.025 --> 04:27.691
Man, you did so great!

04:27.726 --> 04:29.426
Thank you for letting me out.

04:29.461 --> 04:30.694
You're welcome.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.963
Autism Spectrum Disorder,

04:32.999 --> 04:34.031
or ASD,

04:34.066 --> 04:37.034
has seen a 3,000 percent
increase in diagnoses

04:37.069 --> 04:38.769
in the last 30 years.

04:38.805 --> 04:41.371
You can't talk about
autism as a disease.

04:41.407 --> 04:43.573
It's many, many different things,

04:43.609 --> 04:45.875
and it's a range within
each of those things.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.745
We sat down with Dr.
Jeremy Veenstra-Vanderweele,

04:48.781 --> 04:51.981
or Dr. V, a psychiatrist
at Columbia University,

04:52.017 --> 04:53.684
where he devotes most of his time

04:53.719 --> 04:56.686
to pursuing new treatments for autism.

04:56.721 --> 04:58.922
Autism Spectrum Disorder captures

04:58.957 --> 05:00.957
difficulties with social communication,

05:00.992 --> 05:03.426
and restricted repetitive behaviors

05:03.461 --> 05:05.461
that sometimes have
this sensory quality,

05:05.496 --> 05:08.497
that when they are
occurring in the same person,

05:08.533 --> 05:11.901
can be approached with
common assessments.

05:11.937 --> 05:14.903
Why has there been an
increase in identified cases?

05:14.939 --> 05:17.105
So, we don't completely know.

05:17.141 --> 05:19.809
And I mean, that's one of the
things about being in science...

05:19.844 --> 05:22.945
that you have to admit when you
don't have complete knowledge.

05:22.980 --> 05:26.315
Honestly, I think part of the
increase is a real increase.

05:26.351 --> 05:27.817
And that may be

05:27.852 --> 05:31.119
kids who are surviving
neonatal intensive care units...

05:31.155 --> 05:32.354
- Hmm.
- ... who wouldn't have,

05:32.389 --> 05:33.856
- Wow.
- 20, 30 years ago.

05:33.891 --> 05:35.958
We know that those
kids are at higher risk.

05:35.993 --> 05:39.328
It may be things like,
uh, advanced paternal age,

05:39.363 --> 05:40.762
which we know is a risk factor.

05:40.797 --> 05:43.098
Uh, some of it is a decrease in stigma.

05:43.133 --> 05:46.267
So, when I first started
sitting in with people,

05:46.302 --> 05:48.837
families didn't want to hear autism.

05:48.872 --> 05:51.506
- Mm.
- They wanted to hear anything but autism.

05:51.541 --> 05:53.074
And now because people understand

05:53.109 --> 05:56.010
that early intervention can
make a substantial difference,

05:56.045 --> 05:57.645
families are more willing to hear it,

05:57.681 --> 05:59.581
and more likely to
hear it for that reason.

06:05.621 --> 06:08.289
Griffin! Good morning!

06:08.324 --> 06:11.192
Griffin Jaccoma was diagnosed
with autism five years ago

06:11.227 --> 06:13.961
at the Center for Autism
and the Developing Brain,

06:13.997 --> 06:16.964
where Dr. V treats children with ASD.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.500
Come. Let's go. Let's wash up.

06:19.535 --> 06:20.834
No?

06:20.870 --> 06:23.570
Come on, let's go have some breakfast.

06:26.008 --> 06:27.941
It's okay.

06:27.976 --> 06:29.710
Look up. Ready.

06:32.415 --> 06:34.415
What do you want to do, bubbles?

06:40.188 --> 06:41.721
No. We're not standing.

06:43.058 --> 06:45.892
Okay, lift up.

06:45.928 --> 06:47.294
Wanna brush your teeth?

06:47.329 --> 06:49.229
Let me see the bottom.

06:49.264 --> 06:50.997
Yeah! Good job.

06:51.033 --> 06:52.965
What's wrong?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.967
You know what we can do?
We can go outside later.

06:55.002 --> 06:56.636
Would you like to go outside?

06:57.806 --> 06:59.138
Here's your talker.

06:59.173 --> 07:01.040
Okay.

07:01.075 --> 07:02.174
What do you want?

07:02.209 --> 07:03.910
- Bagels.
- Oh, great.

07:06.481 --> 07:10.316
What would take a
typical family 10 minutes,

07:10.351 --> 07:13.052
it takes us 45 minutes.

07:13.087 --> 07:15.754
You know, and so, these
kind of things are difficult,

07:15.789 --> 07:17.189
but it's getting better.

07:17.224 --> 07:20.059
You know, at least now he can
put his head through his shirt,

07:20.094 --> 07:23.695
which may not seem like a
big deal to a typical family,

07:23.730 --> 07:26.164
but to an autistic child

07:26.199 --> 07:27.699
it's like, you know,

07:27.734 --> 07:31.069
trying to have an 8-year-old,
7-year-old do algebra.

07:31.104 --> 07:32.437
It's incredibly difficult.

07:33.907 --> 07:35.574
Watch this. This is sort of fun.

07:35.609 --> 07:37.742
Wanna play ball?

07:37.778 --> 07:40.411
- All the sounds and all this vibration.
- Yeah.

07:40.447 --> 07:42.246
And he's like in heaven now with that.

07:42.282 --> 07:43.848
He's got the sunshine.

07:43.883 --> 07:45.283
- He's got his Ring Pop.
- Yeah.

07:49.022 --> 07:50.388
When did you first see signs

07:50.423 --> 07:52.723
that something was
different about Griffin?

07:52.758 --> 07:55.726
For me, it really was like
somebody had turned off a switch.

07:55.761 --> 07:59.396
I left the house one morning,
and I came back after work,

07:59.431 --> 08:02.132
and I went to have an
exchange with my child,

08:02.167 --> 08:05.836
and, um, it was as if he
was looking right through me.

08:05.872 --> 08:09.673
From that point, I really knew
that something was not right.

08:09.709 --> 08:12.209
A friend encouraged me
to go and have him tested,

08:12.244 --> 08:15.678
because she had had
challenges with her own son,

08:15.714 --> 08:18.115
and I took her advice, and I'm...

08:18.150 --> 08:19.416
I thank God that I did.

08:19.451 --> 08:23.586
The first signs of autism
can be terrifying for parents,

08:23.622 --> 08:27.290
but they can also vary greatly
from one child to the next.

08:27.326 --> 08:28.925
Griffin was diagnosed at age two

08:28.960 --> 08:31.628
by the Autism Diagnostic
Observation Schedule,

08:31.663 --> 08:32.695
or ADOS,

08:32.731 --> 08:34.563
which involves therapists observing

08:34.599 --> 08:36.432
and scoring different behaviors,

08:36.467 --> 08:38.001
and sets a numeric threshold,

08:38.035 --> 08:40.003
for an autism diagnosis.

08:40.038 --> 08:41.703
Standardized tests, like ADOS,

08:41.740 --> 08:45.474
have created more reliable
and earlier autism diagnoses,

08:45.510 --> 08:47.676
better assessment
methods are a key reason

08:47.711 --> 08:49.378
for the rise in autism cases.

08:49.414 --> 08:52.114
And that rise is pushing
the scientific community

08:52.150 --> 08:55.384
to develop a whole new set of
ways to treat the condition.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.556
Angry. Surprised.

09:02.026 --> 09:03.159
Sad.

09:04.361 --> 09:06.695
- Scared.
- Good.

09:06.730 --> 09:07.996
The Autism Glass Project

09:08.032 --> 09:09.831
is one effort from the tech sector

09:09.867 --> 09:11.633
that builds on Google's technology

09:11.669 --> 09:13.268
to teach children with ASD

09:13.303 --> 09:15.103
how to perceive basic emotion,

09:15.138 --> 09:17.505
they often miss in social interactions.

09:17.541 --> 09:20.208
Autism Glass uses
artificial intelligence

09:20.243 --> 09:21.642
to analyze facial expressions,

09:21.678 --> 09:24.979
and then visually and
verbally describes the emotion.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.249
- Happy.
- Good.

09:28.285 --> 09:30.618
We went to Stanford University

09:30.653 --> 09:33.221
to meet its creator, Catalin Voss.

09:33.256 --> 09:36.724
What's running behind us
is a computer vision system

09:36.759 --> 09:38.059
that recognizes emotions.

09:38.094 --> 09:39.660
It's based on a face tracker

09:39.696 --> 09:43.197
that tracks up to 100 fiducial
points within your face,

09:43.232 --> 09:45.532
and then use a machine
learning classifier

09:45.568 --> 09:47.468
to predict whether you're happy

09:47.503 --> 09:48.669
or sad or something like that.

09:48.705 --> 09:49.971
So this is, essentially,

09:50.006 --> 09:51.839
how you developed Autism Glass.

09:51.874 --> 09:53.707
Yeah, exactly.

09:53.742 --> 09:55.609
I was working on, you know,

09:55.644 --> 09:58.245
emotion recognition and
face tracking software.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.447
And we realized, "Hey!

10:00.483 --> 10:01.815
"This could help people who struggle

10:01.850 --> 10:03.550
to identify social cues."

10:03.586 --> 10:05.685
You know, we're spending time

10:05.721 --> 10:08.054
building software
that can teach machines

10:08.090 --> 10:09.923
how to recognize emotions.

10:09.958 --> 10:11.091
There happen to be people

10:11.126 --> 10:13.827
who struggle to identify
social cues in people's faces.

10:13.862 --> 10:17.163
The Glass Project is focusing
on these fundamental emotions

10:17.198 --> 10:18.431
that everybody must know, must learn.

10:18.466 --> 10:21.334
Kids with autism don't
necessarily look to faces.

10:21.369 --> 10:23.737
They're not getting
those neurons developed,

10:23.772 --> 10:25.839
those layers of the onion peeled back

10:25.874 --> 10:26.872
so they can proceed

10:26.907 --> 10:29.575
into more complex social
scenarios on their own.

10:29.611 --> 10:31.344
Why was it so important
to create a device

10:31.379 --> 10:32.978
that parents could take home with them

10:33.014 --> 10:35.214
as opposed to use in a therapy session?

10:35.250 --> 10:38.351
It creates these opportunities
for natural engagements

10:38.386 --> 10:41.554
between parent and child,
care provider and the child,

10:41.589 --> 10:44.422
in ways that we almost
didn't initially anticipate.

10:44.458 --> 10:47.159
Moms and Dads of children with autism

10:47.194 --> 10:50.729
are, by far, the best
suited to teach their kids.

10:51.932 --> 10:53.732
The changes that I have seen...

10:53.768 --> 10:55.934
night and day differences!

10:55.970 --> 10:57.369
Sarah, you're up! Dice!

10:57.404 --> 10:58.904
I mean, almost immediately,

10:58.939 --> 11:01.640
I would tell her, "Hey, can you
look at me?" and she'd look at me.

11:01.675 --> 11:04.176
Before... short answers.

11:04.211 --> 11:06.278
"Yeah, I'm fine." After...

11:06.313 --> 11:09.147
she was able to have
confidence to speak back

11:09.183 --> 11:10.848
without feeling like...

11:10.884 --> 11:13.751
what she was gonna say was wrong.

11:13.787 --> 11:18.589
And now she actually will
have a conversation with us.

11:18.624 --> 11:20.424
That's so priceless.

11:21.961 --> 11:25.396
Autism Glass could provide
much-needed relief to families,

11:25.431 --> 11:28.032
and several other promising
experimental treatments

11:28.068 --> 11:31.502
are already well under
way in clinical studies.

11:31.537 --> 11:34.471
Harvard neurologist,
Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone

11:34.507 --> 11:35.906
pioneered a technique called

11:35.941 --> 11:38.275
Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation,

11:38.311 --> 11:40.143
or TMS.

11:40.179 --> 11:44.047
TMS is a way to inject
current in the brain

11:44.083 --> 11:48.485
without having to do surgery
and open up the skull.

11:49.688 --> 11:54.157
A coil of wire outside the
head generates a magnetic field,

11:54.193 --> 11:57.660
and that magnetic field
reaches the brain unimpeded.

11:57.696 --> 12:00.530
It makes those cells that are targeted

12:00.565 --> 12:02.966
fire in a different way.

12:03.001 --> 12:05.401
It can either make them fire more

12:05.437 --> 12:09.539
or be suppressed for
some period of time.

12:09.574 --> 12:11.307
And that allows us

12:11.343 --> 12:15.211
to figure out what causal role

12:15.247 --> 12:18.715
a given brain area has
for a given behavior.

12:20.885 --> 12:24.019
So, we're gonna go
into the TMS room here.

12:24.055 --> 12:26.255
At Bradley Hospital,
Dr. Lindsay Oberman,

12:26.290 --> 12:30.325
performs a TMS procedure
on 16-year-old Evan Theilig,

12:30.361 --> 12:32.527
a high school student at
the high-functioning end

12:32.563 --> 12:34.196
of the autism spectrum.

12:34.232 --> 12:37.099
Help us to understand
what's going on in your mind

12:37.135 --> 12:39.067
in, uh, in a social situation.

12:39.102 --> 12:41.069
Every... like, if... well,
every time I ask a question,

12:41.104 --> 12:43.705
I, like, before, like,
talking, I ask myself,

12:43.741 --> 12:46.275
do I really care about
the outcome of this?

12:46.310 --> 12:48.243
Like if... if I asked if someone...

12:48.279 --> 12:50.779
if someone's having a good day or not,

12:50.814 --> 12:53.915
do I actually care
whether they say yes or no?

12:53.950 --> 12:56.617
Is it kind of like you over-analyze

12:56.653 --> 12:58.887
what could be a very simple question

12:58.922 --> 13:00.288
- that would start a conversation?
- Always.

13:00.323 --> 13:01.722
It works great with math,

13:01.758 --> 13:03.491
because you can... there's only...

13:03.526 --> 13:04.659
there's, like, a logical limit

13:04.694 --> 13:07.361
to how much you can over-analyze

13:07.397 --> 13:10.198
before you already
have the answer, but...

13:10.233 --> 13:13.601
with an English class,
since... I have...

13:13.636 --> 13:15.536
you'd have to... I'd have to...

13:15.571 --> 13:17.471
Like the assignment, like
the book that we were...

13:17.507 --> 13:19.573
not book, but, like, the play
we were, like, looking at,

13:19.609 --> 13:21.776
was the, uh, The Crucible.
Have you heard of that?

13:21.811 --> 13:22.777
Yeah.

13:22.812 --> 13:25.746
Yeah, I was having... have a, uh,

13:25.782 --> 13:29.716
hard time reading, like,
reading it, because...

13:29.751 --> 13:33.020
I guess the person who put it
in the, uh, the uh, textbook

13:33.055 --> 13:35.755
didn't know the first thing
about actual formatting.

13:35.791 --> 13:39.193
So, they used, like,
a stupid Serif font.

13:39.228 --> 13:41.028
So I couldn't really get over that.

13:41.063 --> 13:41.895
I'm gonna adjust this so that

13:41.931 --> 13:43.763
it's comfortable for you, all right?

13:43.799 --> 13:45.097
I believe you.

13:49.638 --> 13:54.507
The brain is influenced
by everything we do...

13:54.543 --> 13:56.343
by every experience we have,

13:56.378 --> 13:57.811
by every thought we have,

13:57.846 --> 13:59.479
by every action we take.

13:59.514 --> 14:01.214
The concept of plasticity

14:01.249 --> 14:05.051
is the idea that the brain
intrinsically is changing,

14:05.086 --> 14:07.253
is modified by experience.

14:07.288 --> 14:10.356
But also because of plasticity,

14:10.391 --> 14:12.892
we may develop symptoms of disease.

14:12.927 --> 14:14.927
If you have a more plastic brain,

14:14.963 --> 14:17.896
well, you should be able
to acquire skills quicker,

14:17.931 --> 14:19.631
to learn things faster.

14:19.667 --> 14:23.569
But if you're influenced too
much by the experiences you have,

14:23.604 --> 14:26.204
you run into this chain reaction

14:26.240 --> 14:28.674
where the brain becomes
progressively noisy,

14:28.709 --> 14:31.176
rather than progressively
better structured.

14:32.580 --> 14:36.014
The benefits of TMS vary
greatly between participants,

14:36.049 --> 14:39.985
but it's already shown
some extraordinary results.

14:40.020 --> 14:43.955
One of Dr. Pascual-Leone's first
participants was John Robison,

14:43.991 --> 14:47.125
who credits TMS with changing his life.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.261
They were gonna do a
half-hour stimulation

14:49.296 --> 14:51.729
and the effects would
last about half that long.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.731
And they kept me there
another half hour or so

14:53.767 --> 14:55.966
to make I didn't, like, just roll over

14:56.002 --> 14:57.735
and die after the experiment.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.771
And then they let me loose.

14:59.806 --> 15:02.540
And... and I pulled
out onto the highway,

15:02.575 --> 15:04.675
and I turned on the music.

15:04.711 --> 15:07.111
I could hear every individual voice,

15:07.146 --> 15:08.779
all the singers and the chorus.

15:08.814 --> 15:10.080
I could hear each instrument.

15:10.116 --> 15:13.884
I could... I could all see them
in my mind moving around the stage.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.653
It was like I was
transported from the car

15:16.688 --> 15:18.455
right into the concert.

15:18.490 --> 15:20.958
And it was just, uh, just staggering.

15:20.993 --> 15:22.859
And it was just so overwhelming,

15:22.895 --> 15:25.094
it made me cry all the way home.

15:25.130 --> 15:26.897
And I... I wrote the doctors,

15:26.932 --> 15:28.498
I said, "That's some powerful mojo

15:28.534 --> 15:30.199
you guys have in that thing."

15:32.538 --> 15:34.538
After a series of TMS sessions,

15:34.573 --> 15:36.440
Robison, like a number of others,

15:36.475 --> 15:38.742
was able to gain a cognitive perspective

15:38.777 --> 15:40.609
that has greatly broadened his ability

15:40.645 --> 15:43.046
to read and recognize emotions.

15:43.081 --> 15:46.182
Imagine that you are
a color-blind person,

15:46.217 --> 15:47.350
and all your life,

15:47.385 --> 15:51.054
you listen to people talk
about the beautiful blue sky,

15:51.089 --> 15:52.555
and the pretty red dress,

15:52.590 --> 15:54.690
and the deep green lawn.

15:54.725 --> 15:57.960
And, um, and you saw the world
in different shades of gray,

15:57.995 --> 15:59.862
and you... you looked
at that, and you said,

15:59.897 --> 16:01.730
"This is bullshit.
They're just baiting me."

16:01.766 --> 16:04.600
And imagine you go
into a scientists' lab,

16:04.635 --> 16:05.434
and they do something to you

16:05.470 --> 16:07.937
and they turn on color and you walk out,

16:07.972 --> 16:10.205
and you say, "Holy shit. This is real.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.373
They weren't lying to me.

16:11.408 --> 16:12.641
I see that blue sky,

16:12.677 --> 16:15.077
and I, now, I see the green lawn,

16:15.112 --> 16:18.347
and... and... that must be
a... a red dress she has,

16:18.382 --> 16:20.782
and a blue shirt, and a yellow shirt.

16:20.817 --> 16:22.951
And they are beautiful."

16:22.987 --> 16:24.319
And then it fades away.

16:25.489 --> 16:27.622
But you know what, for
the rest of your life,

16:27.657 --> 16:29.224
you're gonna know that was real,

16:29.259 --> 16:31.960
and you're gonna
always react differently

16:31.995 --> 16:33.628
than the day before it happened.

16:33.663 --> 16:34.996
You'll never go back.

16:35.031 --> 16:39.300
While emerging therapies
are already showing results,

16:39.335 --> 16:40.935
many scientists believe that focusing

16:40.971 --> 16:43.004
on the underlying
biology of the condition

16:43.039 --> 16:46.107
will lead to the most
transformative treatments.

16:46.142 --> 16:48.242
So far, scientists have discovered

16:48.277 --> 16:50.878
hundreds of genes implicated in ASD,

16:50.913 --> 16:52.880
and researchers are
tracking their effects

16:52.915 --> 16:54.548
in an unexpected place.

16:58.321 --> 16:59.753
We're headed toward Monkey Island,

16:59.788 --> 17:02.223
which is just right off
the mainland of Puerto Rico.

17:02.258 --> 17:05.925
There are over 1500 monkeys
that are roaming freely there.

17:05.961 --> 17:08.127
The rhesus monkeys of Cayo Santiago

17:08.163 --> 17:09.663
descend from an original colony

17:09.698 --> 17:13.165
brought over from India
for research in 1938.

17:13.201 --> 17:16.368
Today, the world's first
wild primate research facility

17:16.405 --> 17:18.238
has become a genetics goldmine

17:18.272 --> 17:20.373
for scientists studying autism.

17:20.409 --> 17:22.108
What we've got here is

17:22.144 --> 17:23.976
a kind of variation in behavior

17:24.012 --> 17:26.346
that would be very
difficult to approximate

17:26.381 --> 17:27.480
in any other kind of place.

17:27.516 --> 17:30.316
Dr. Michael Platt is a neuroscientist

17:30.352 --> 17:32.285
at the University of Pennsylvania.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.753
He and his research team study

17:33.788 --> 17:35.688
how the genetic makeup of each macaque

17:35.723 --> 17:38.390
leads to unique behavioral traits.

17:38.426 --> 17:40.726
How do you match genetics to behavior?

17:40.762 --> 17:43.996
Each animal is unique in
the genes that they possess.

17:44.032 --> 17:46.999
We are extracting DNA.

17:47.035 --> 17:49.769
We then decode the
genome of these animals,

17:49.804 --> 17:51.303
and then, at the same time,

17:51.338 --> 17:54.739
we are doing intensive
behavioral observations.

17:54.775 --> 17:57.576
If we can decode those genes,
and we can find those monkeys,

17:57.611 --> 17:59.711
we can track, say, the
behavior of an animal

17:59.746 --> 18:01.413
who's carrying a certain set of genes

18:01.449 --> 18:02.948
that we think might be implicated

18:02.983 --> 18:04.749
in various disorders like autism.

18:04.785 --> 18:06.051
We can see whether their behavior is

18:06.087 --> 18:08.153
systematically different
than other monkeys.

18:10.991 --> 18:12.724
Now, we've identified
a few of the monkeys

18:12.759 --> 18:14.926
who possess variance
in the number of genes

18:14.962 --> 18:16.962
that the rest of the
population does not,

18:16.997 --> 18:20.531
and these monkeys tend to
not fit in well in societies.

18:21.635 --> 18:22.934
Behind us, sitting in this tree,

18:22.970 --> 18:25.403
is a female named 42-L.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.671
She tends to live on
the outskirts of groups.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.039
She's never really fit in.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.074
Uh, she has a daughter

18:30.110 --> 18:33.111
who has also had difficulty
fitting into groups.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.712
And the two of them both share

18:34.747 --> 18:36.347
a variance in a number of genes

18:36.382 --> 18:38.583
that we don't see in the
rest of the population,

18:38.618 --> 18:40.050
and these genes have been implicated

18:40.086 --> 18:43.286
in studies of autism in people.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.789
Ultimately, to really
test it experimentally,

18:45.825 --> 18:47.891
you would have to manipulate that gene

18:47.927 --> 18:49.960
and demonstrate that you had

18:49.996 --> 18:51.595
an effect on behavior...

18:51.631 --> 18:52.763
- Mmm.
- ... down the line.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.798
But now, there are efforts

18:54.834 --> 18:58.035
to use very, you know, cutting-edge

18:58.070 --> 19:00.903
techniques to actually
genetically alter these animals.

19:00.939 --> 19:04.774
Scientists have been modifying
genes for some time now.

19:04.809 --> 19:07.010
But the technology took
a giant leap forward

19:07.045 --> 19:08.478
with the advent of CRISPR,

19:08.514 --> 19:11.681
which allows them to actually
cut and paste genetic information

19:11.716 --> 19:13.650
with pinpoint accuracy.

19:15.386 --> 19:17.353
At MIT, Dr. Guoping Feng

19:17.388 --> 19:18.888
is studying one of the more common genes

19:18.923 --> 19:21.490
Shank3.

19:24.262 --> 19:26.162
Shank3 is a very important gene

19:26.197 --> 19:29.032
for developing
neuron-neuron connections.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.500
If neuron do not connect properly,

19:31.536 --> 19:33.202
the brain cannot function normally.

19:33.237 --> 19:37.573
Clinical scientists discovered
that deletion of this gene

19:37.608 --> 19:40.842
is linked directly to
Autism Spectrum Disorders.

19:40.878 --> 19:44.413
In what ways are you using
CRISPR technology today?

19:44.448 --> 19:46.114
CRISPR allows you to do

19:46.150 --> 19:48.416
any kind of genetic mutations.

19:48.451 --> 19:50.986
So, we can put in the human mutation

19:51.021 --> 19:54.255
into that animal model to
mimic the human condition.

19:55.959 --> 19:58.660
If you put two mice
together, normal mice,

19:58.696 --> 20:00.295
they will immediately find each other...

20:00.330 --> 20:01.396
sniffing, cuddling.

20:01.431 --> 20:04.066
But if you put two Shank3
mutant mice together,

20:04.101 --> 20:05.700
when they're getting
close to each other,

20:05.735 --> 20:07.535
they will suddenly separate.

20:07.571 --> 20:10.305
If we put a toy into their cages,

20:10.340 --> 20:12.607
normal mice, then they
will go play with it.

20:12.642 --> 20:14.275
They even will get on top of it.

20:14.311 --> 20:16.777
Mutant mice, they
were suddenly startled.

20:16.813 --> 20:18.246
They never will touch it.

20:18.281 --> 20:20.315
They have a very hyper-sensitivity

20:20.350 --> 20:22.282
of their whisker
system, which is their...

20:22.318 --> 20:25.352
one of their primary sensory organs.

20:26.388 --> 20:27.354
Dr. Feng observes

20:27.389 --> 20:29.356
how the mice's outward behavior changes

20:29.391 --> 20:32.526
and how the gene affects the
brain at the cellular level.

20:33.562 --> 20:35.062
But he has goals beyond understanding

20:35.098 --> 20:37.897
the mechanisms that cause autism.

20:37.933 --> 20:42.035
How will this translate to
creating treatments for humans?

20:42.070 --> 20:44.804
You can imagine people are very excited

20:44.840 --> 20:47.807
about using CRISPR to
correct the mutations.

20:47.843 --> 20:49.409
If we know the mutation,

20:49.445 --> 20:53.780
now you supply a normal
copy of DNA template,

20:53.815 --> 20:56.216
then that normal copy will go in

20:56.251 --> 20:57.817
and replace the mutant.

20:57.853 --> 20:59.318
Now, you correct the mutation.

20:59.354 --> 21:01.721
Basically, you permanently
corrected the problem.

21:01.757 --> 21:02.655
That's called a cure.

21:02.690 --> 21:05.191
So, in our lifetimes,
will a child with autism

21:05.227 --> 21:06.960
be able to walk into the hospital

21:06.995 --> 21:08.161
for gene therapy,

21:08.196 --> 21:10.396
and walk out without autistic behaviors?

21:10.431 --> 21:13.366
For some of them, I... I
believe this is totally possible.

21:14.835 --> 21:17.202
For many families, a cure for autism

21:17.238 --> 21:18.571
is their greatest hope.

21:18.606 --> 21:19.838
But a growing number of advocates,

21:19.874 --> 21:22.275
within the autistic
community, think differently.

21:22.310 --> 21:25.411
Autistic rights are human rights!

21:25.446 --> 21:28.013
These voices call upon
the scientific community

21:28.048 --> 21:30.415
to recognize neurological differences

21:30.450 --> 21:32.151
as part of natural human diversity,

21:32.186 --> 21:35.687
not as medical afflictions
that must be eradicated.

21:35.722 --> 21:37.189
In 2010,

21:37.224 --> 21:41.827
NIH spent about $217
million on autism research.

21:41.862 --> 21:44.996
Of that, only one and a half percent

21:45.031 --> 21:48.032
went towards research on
autistic adults and our needs.

21:48.067 --> 21:50.435
I believe this is a civil rights issue,

21:50.470 --> 21:53.171
and I believe that the
United States of America

21:53.206 --> 21:56.408
can guarantee the civil
rights of all of its citizens.

21:56.443 --> 21:59.811
One of those self-advocates
is John Robison.

21:59.846 --> 22:01.913
Long before his autism diagnosis

22:01.948 --> 22:03.114
and TMS treatment,

22:03.149 --> 22:07.051
Robison had a successful
career as an audio engineer.

22:07.086 --> 22:08.853
I got to working for, uh...

22:08.888 --> 22:11.189
Pink Floyd's sound
company, Britannia Row.

22:11.224 --> 22:14.725
And, um, this is one of the
bass amps from our system.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.893
It's still got the old markings.

22:16.929 --> 22:19.430
Pink Floyd Mark III amplifier.

22:19.465 --> 22:21.565
Rock and roll relics now, anyway.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.000
This was, uh, this was me with KISS.

22:24.036 --> 22:27.638
♪ I wanna rock and roll all night ♪

22:27.673 --> 22:29.707
So I built a bunch of stuff

22:29.742 --> 22:31.809
for the 1980 KISS tour.

22:31.844 --> 22:33.676
Really, every guitar in those years

22:33.712 --> 22:35.278
that shot fire, shot rockets,

22:35.314 --> 22:37.613
blew up, if it... if
it did something wild,

22:37.649 --> 22:38.949
we kinda made it.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.652
Sometimes people look
at me, and they think,

22:42.687 --> 22:45.521
"Oh, well, Robison,
he's just a natural-born

22:45.557 --> 22:47.824
electronic genius or something"

22:47.860 --> 22:48.992
but that's not true.

22:49.027 --> 22:50.860
What happened was,

22:50.895 --> 22:52.328
I was rejected by people,

22:52.364 --> 22:56.432
and I was, I felt,
accepted by electronics.

22:56.468 --> 22:57.667
And... and I dropped out of school,

22:57.702 --> 23:01.237
and I spent 10, 12, 15 hours
a day studying electronics,

23:01.272 --> 23:03.706
and by the time I was 18 years old,

23:03.742 --> 23:06.909
that was, you know, thousands
and thousands of hours.

23:06.944 --> 23:10.712
So, the autism was the thing
that really hurt me as a boy,

23:10.748 --> 23:12.814
but it also gave me my freedom.

23:17.721 --> 23:20.122
Now Robison owns an auto repair shop

23:20.157 --> 23:21.456
for luxury cars,

23:21.492 --> 23:23.191
which he uses to run a mechanics school

23:23.226 --> 23:25.861
for students with
developmental disabilities.

23:25.896 --> 23:28.530
All this leather paneling
and woodwork and all?

23:28.565 --> 23:29.898
All this is gonna come out.

23:29.933 --> 23:31.900
We're gonna put racing seats in.

23:31.935 --> 23:34.803
It's gonna be completely
gutted and bare.

23:34.838 --> 23:36.805
It's gonna be a race car inside.

23:36.840 --> 23:38.607
And while he credits TMS

23:38.642 --> 23:40.474
for giving him the
social skills necessary

23:40.510 --> 23:43.378
to be a public advocate
for the autistic community,

23:43.413 --> 23:46.948
he lectures about the
benefits of neuro diversity.

23:46.983 --> 23:48.482
What is neuro diversity?

23:48.518 --> 23:50.885
Neuro diversity is the recognition

23:50.921 --> 23:54.022
that there is a range of
neurological difference

23:54.057 --> 23:56.056
that is a part of humanity.

23:56.091 --> 23:58.025
We could take any other population.

23:58.060 --> 24:00.294
We could take the Jewish population,

24:00.329 --> 24:02.062
the Native American population,

24:02.097 --> 24:04.131
the white male population,

24:04.166 --> 24:05.566
and within that group,

24:05.601 --> 24:07.167
we could find some people

24:07.202 --> 24:09.670
who are really
intellectually challenged,

24:09.705 --> 24:12.072
and some people who
are brilliant geniuses,

24:12.107 --> 24:14.541
and most people who
are somewhere between.

24:14.576 --> 24:17.544
And autistic people are the same.

24:17.579 --> 24:19.379
We have some significant challenges,

24:19.415 --> 24:21.014
but we have some significant gifts,

24:21.050 --> 24:23.883
and it's time to move beyond the model

24:23.919 --> 24:27.421
of autistic people as broken normals

24:27.456 --> 24:29.422
and recognize us as what we are.

24:29.458 --> 24:32.659
Thanks to this community activity,

24:32.694 --> 24:35.161
we have scientists
coming out of the closet.

24:35.196 --> 24:38.498
For us, this is like gay
rights in the '60s and '70s.

24:38.533 --> 24:41.067
We now have scientists
that stand up and say,

24:41.102 --> 24:43.135
"I'm autistic and I'm proud of it.

24:43.171 --> 24:45.137
And I'm gonna help autistic people

24:45.173 --> 24:46.705
because of my difference.

24:46.740 --> 24:50.209
Not in spite of it, but because of it."

24:50.244 --> 24:52.578
What advocates like
Robison are asking for,

24:52.613 --> 24:54.646
is not to wipe autism off the map,

24:54.682 --> 24:56.882
but to focus on developing solutions

24:56.917 --> 24:59.051
for patients' day-to-day needs.

24:59.087 --> 25:01.520
Where do you hope autism
research goes from here?

25:01.555 --> 25:07.325
We need to shift towards
delivering benefit to us today.

25:07.361 --> 25:10.061
And it's great to think
that we can head off

25:10.097 --> 25:13.765
really profound disability
at some far future date,

25:13.801 --> 25:17.369
but we have the ability
to solve problems right now

25:17.404 --> 25:19.937
if we deploy the resources to do it.

25:19.973 --> 25:22.740
And that's what I push scientists to do.

25:25.312 --> 25:27.245
There are people with autism

25:27.280 --> 25:28.779
who can speak for themselves,

25:28.815 --> 25:31.016
and say what would improve their lives,

25:31.051 --> 25:32.650
and I think we need to listen to that.

25:32.685 --> 25:35.386
And I think we need to
think about ways to help.

25:35.421 --> 25:39.924
At the same time, I work with a
lot of people who can't say that,

25:39.959 --> 25:41.692
who can't speak up for themselves

25:41.728 --> 25:44.161
and say what they would like.

25:44.196 --> 25:47.798
What we have to do then is
to listen to their families,

25:47.834 --> 25:51.335
and also, imagine
ourselves in their shoes

25:51.370 --> 25:53.570
and what would improve their lives.

25:53.605 --> 25:56.706
Ultimately that, at this point, means

25:56.742 --> 25:58.208
research based in biology,

25:58.244 --> 26:03.013
trying to understand what's
happening that leads to autism risk,

26:03.049 --> 26:05.516
what we can do to lead
to better outcomes,

26:05.551 --> 26:08.985
not just for people who are
able to speak for themselves.

26:09.021 --> 26:11.688
Ten years ago, we have no
clue what causes autism,

26:11.723 --> 26:14.057
now we have many genes to work on.

26:14.092 --> 26:17.060
My feeling is that in
the next 10 to 15 years,

26:17.095 --> 26:19.996
we will have some much
better treatment...

26:20.032 --> 26:22.966
for the drug treatment, for
can cure some of the symptoms.

26:23.001 --> 26:24.000
It's a still long way,

26:24.036 --> 26:26.936
but I think the progress
is actually incredible.
