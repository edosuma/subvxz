WEBVTT

00:22.022 --> 00:25.400
<i>I'm Squalid Squirrel. </i>

00:25.483 --> 00:27.777
Listen
to that annoying voice.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.696
It's the squirrel of my dreams.

00:29.779 --> 00:32.115
Huh, just when I thought
I had you figured out.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.826
- Ah, the joy of cartoons.

00:34.909 --> 00:37.537
But this is utter lunacy,
skeletons can't dance.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.496
Unless…

00:38.580 --> 00:39.998
I love cartoons.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.375
It's like real life but for simpletons.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.501
Shush it. Just enjoy it.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.587
Bean, come out.

00:45.670 --> 00:49.257
And I'm gonna guess
your name is Moose? Fancy a beer?

00:49.340 --> 00:50.425
- Yes.
- No.

00:50.508 --> 00:51.718
- Yes.
- Maybe later.

00:51.801 --> 00:52.969
- Yes.
- Okay, yes.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.388
But first, you tell me
why the elevator from Hell

00:55.472 --> 00:57.182
goes straight to your office.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.809
What's your connection to Hell,
and where is that beer?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.770
I lied. There is no beer.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.773
I lied again.

01:04.856 --> 01:07.692
Of course, there's beer,
but you can't have any.

01:07.776 --> 01:08.902
Jerry, hammer.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.946
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.824
Ugh! Those bulbs are expensive
and sold separately.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.201
Start talking, Alva.

01:16.284 --> 01:19.329
I want names, dates,
three beers and a bowl of nuts.

01:31.841 --> 01:32.675
Ow!

01:32.759 --> 01:33.843
My knuckles.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.949
Why are we sneaking around?

01:56.032 --> 01:58.660
Queen want little jerk all to herself.

01:58.743 --> 01:59.953
Maybe she's hungry.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.287
She can't eat me.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.332
I'm a passionate thinking being
with hopes and dreams.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.793
And I haven't
finished writing my epic novel.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.294
The hero is named Elfis.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.421
Shut up and start basting yourself.

02:10.505 --> 02:13.424
This is exactly like chapter 32.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.886
Oh, I'm so sorry,
but I'm allergic to apples.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.431
Hmm?

02:38.700 --> 02:39.659
Hmm?

02:44.038 --> 02:45.874
- Over there.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.961
I'll belch for you when I'm done.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.592
Ah, there you are.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.510
Damn elf shoes
betray me every time.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.728
- Shank! Shank! Shank!

03:07.770 --> 03:09.606
Please, spare me.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.818
What the hell is wrong with you?

03:13.902 --> 03:17.113
Now, tell me who you are. Go on.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.698
- What?
- Say it.

03:18.781 --> 03:19.949
I don't follow you.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.868
Hi. I'm…

03:21.951 --> 03:28.124
I'm… trying to understand
what's happening.

03:28.208 --> 03:32.879
Oh, I know you're gonna say it.
It's right on the tip of your tongue.

03:32.962 --> 03:36.257
- Hi, I'm…
- Elfo?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.134
Hi, I'm Elfo?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.720
- And I'm your mama.
- What?

03:40.803 --> 03:41.846
Oh…

03:41.930 --> 03:44.182
Big girl like you? No way.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.642
Then why would you want to eat me?

03:45.725 --> 03:48.686
Oh, I don't want to eat you.
I want you to eat.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.356
Look, I brought your favorite food.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.191
Anchovies in mustard sauce.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.442
Oh, my God.

03:54.525 --> 03:58.738
Only my therapist, my pizza delivery boy
or my mother would know that.

03:59.238 --> 04:01.199
You <i>are</i> my mother.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.034
But I thought you were dead.

04:03.117 --> 04:06.204
I thought <i>you</i> were dead
until your girlfriend said your name.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.455
You mean Bean?

04:07.538 --> 04:11.501
Oh, we have an open relationship.
We agreed to see other species.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.795
Well, you're Mama's boy now.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.713
But we've got to keep it a secret.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.425
Don't worry. I'm never going to let
anyone take you away from me again.

04:19.509 --> 04:23.096
- Give me that.
- Brock, that's no ordinary elf.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.765
What is it with you and elves, Grogda?

04:25.848 --> 04:29.686
This little runt killed nine of my
bravest and least effective guards.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.939
You know the rules. We kill him at dawn.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.652
- What? No!

04:37.735 --> 04:39.904
No!

04:52.333 --> 04:53.334
Hmm?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.217
Hmm?

05:09.642 --> 05:10.935
Bean was here.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.937
What crummy handwriting.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.147
Oh…

05:16.399 --> 05:19.360
Before there's any unnecessary
clobbering, I want you to know,

05:19.444 --> 05:21.487
I realize I made a mistake.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.198
I really dig you,
but I can't make you love me.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.117
That's good 'cause I don't even like you.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.035
What?

05:27.118 --> 05:28.870
Oh, yeah.

05:28.953 --> 05:29.829
Good one, Bean.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.707
Cool chair but don't act coy.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.250
It's my latest invention.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.461
The ass chariot. Care to take a spin?

05:36.544 --> 05:38.629
Knock it off. What do you know about Hell?

05:39.380 --> 05:42.675
We're neighbors, that's all.
You don't get to choose your neighbors.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.260
Yes, that's it.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.471
Besides, Hell puts the steam in Steamland.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.723
Everyone knows that.
Geothermal chambers and all.

05:48.806 --> 05:50.975
What the amusement
park ride said, remember?

05:51.059 --> 05:52.810
The ride did not mention Hell.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.146
Steamland and Hell. We have a deal.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.898
I don't believe you know Satan.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.025
Charming chap. Surprisingly debonair.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.068
What does he look like?

06:00.151 --> 06:03.780
Red face, little horns,
lovely high cheekbones, pointy goatee.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.074
You're just looking
at that hot sauce bottle.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.576
- What color are his eyes?
- Swirling beach balls.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.036
So, you do know him.

06:10.119 --> 06:12.705
Okay, but wait a sec.
You do not make a deal with the devil

06:12.789 --> 06:14.248
and just go about your life.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.001
La-di-da-di-da-di-da.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.004
Jerry!

06:20.088 --> 06:21.339
I thought we were singing.

06:21.422 --> 06:24.008
Maybe the good people
of Steamland would like to know

06:24.092 --> 06:25.760
about your deal with Satan, huh?

06:25.843 --> 06:30.681
I'm gonna tell everyone your stience
is powered by hellfire and damnation.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.351
And I'm gonna tell Satan
what you said about his mother.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.560
But I didn't say anything.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.938
It's actually what I said,
but I'm gonna tell him you said it.

06:37.021 --> 06:39.732
Bean, I'm not too good
at reading social signals,

06:39.816 --> 06:41.943
but you look beautiful when you're angry.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.069
Hold me back, Jerry.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.196
- Hold me back, Jerry!
- I'm holding you back.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.697
Don't let me hit him 'cause I'll hit him.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.533
- She'll hit you.
- Be careful!

06:48.616 --> 06:50.159
Do not come at us!

06:50.243 --> 06:51.953
- Okay, calm down, Bean.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.663
Oh, looks like the wrong thing to say.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.416
Listen, I want to win
your trust back and not get hit.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.167
To show you my intentions are pure…

06:58.251 --> 07:00.586
- Yeah, pure lust, you perv.
- Lust?

07:00.670 --> 07:01.838
Bean, look at me.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.424
It's midnight,
and I'm sitting alone watching cartoons

07:04.507 --> 07:06.217
and eating bean dip from a can.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.468
You can trust me.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.096
I'll prove it to you right now.
I'll take you home.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.975
The biggest airship
in all of Steamland.

07:14.058 --> 07:17.395
I felt compelled to build it
for reasons mysterious to me.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.939
I call it, "The Compensator."

07:24.986 --> 07:26.279
To Dreamland we go!

07:26.362 --> 07:28.239
And along the way, Bean,
you'll see something

07:28.322 --> 07:30.533
that will prove science
combined with magic

07:30.616 --> 07:33.035
can take us beyond our wildest dreams.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.454
- Ow!
- Jerry!

07:34.537 --> 07:36.247
He was talking too much.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.248
Let's beat it.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.751
You'd think Alva would've
invented guard rails.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.337
Oh, look at all them bugs.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.392
What the hell are you doing?

07:56.476 --> 07:59.395
I'm trying to sleep
before they kill me in the morning.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.481
- Don't tell me what to do.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.316
Quiet, you knucklehead!

08:03.399 --> 08:05.776
Pops, you're rescuing me?

08:08.654 --> 08:11.157
Not anymore, you dead-brain chatterbox.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.283
What's wrong with you?

08:12.366 --> 08:15.286
You don't even know when it's time
to use your yap or take a nap.

08:15.369 --> 08:18.748
Pops, how did you find me?
What are you doing here? Don't hit me.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.917
Oh, I got a real story for you.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.628
- So, pull up a stool, boy.
- There are no stools in here.

08:23.711 --> 08:26.172
I wish I had a stool.
I'd cave your head in.

08:26.255 --> 08:29.008
Turns out I'm the real reason
you are here. You see--

08:29.091 --> 08:32.220
No, I know. And I have so many questions.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.096
Like, why do you talk like that?

08:34.180 --> 08:35.097
Shut up!

08:35.181 --> 08:39.018
It all started way back
before you were interrupting everyone.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.102
Oh! So, never.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.022
You sure you don't have a stool?

08:43.105 --> 08:46.817
I was a traveling salesman
with the Elfwood Candy Company.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.536
<i>I left Elfwood with my best friend,</i>

08:56.619 --> 08:58.871
<i>- a giant dog named Barko.</i>

09:08.714 --> 09:12.134
<i>I could sell anything to anyone,</i>
<i>anywhere at any time.</i>

09:12.218 --> 09:14.637
<i>Anywho, I made a lot of folks happy,</i>

09:14.720 --> 09:16.138
<i>and a lot more folks fat.</i>

09:16.222 --> 09:18.641
<i>Met some colorful characters in my day.</i>

09:19.559 --> 09:20.851
Wow!

09:25.356 --> 09:27.316
<i>Guten tag,</i> stranger.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.944
- I'm Gretel.
- And I'm Hansel, creep.

09:30.027 --> 09:33.197
Well, hello, obese kids.
Is your parents home?

09:33.281 --> 09:35.116
<i>- Nein.</i>
<i>- Nein.</i>

09:35.199 --> 09:36.158
We ate them.

09:36.242 --> 09:40.288
Well, it sounds like two little chub tubs
have earned their dessert.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.999
Mmm…

09:43.583 --> 09:46.586
<i>Seems there were</i>
<i>a few lonely ladies out there</i>

09:46.669 --> 09:49.297
<i>who wanted something</i>
<i>more substantial than candy.</i>

09:49.380 --> 09:51.132
And I ain't talking about flapjacks,

09:51.215 --> 09:53.634
unless you're talking
about undoing my flap, Jack.

09:53.718 --> 09:54.802
Yes, I get it.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.638
Can we please steer the story away
from this uncomfortable area

09:57.722 --> 09:59.640
and back to me, please, Pops?

10:00.725 --> 10:03.853
<i>Well, there was one gal who stood</i>
<i>head and shoulders above the rest.</i>

10:03.936 --> 10:07.064
<i>And not just because</i>
<i>she was so freakishly tall.</i>

10:07.148 --> 10:10.901
Hey, you ever dream about
having relations with a mighty sequoia?

10:12.111 --> 10:13.821
<i>She were a princess.</i>

10:13.904 --> 10:16.282
Heh. We both like
big ol' princesses, eh, Elfo?

10:16.365 --> 10:17.408
Ooh-wee!

10:17.491 --> 10:19.410
Yes, Pops. Just get on with it.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.786
Now, where was I?

10:20.870 --> 10:21.746
Oh, yeah!

10:21.829 --> 10:22.788
Ooh-wee!

10:22.872 --> 10:23.706
Pops!

10:23.789 --> 10:27.209
Anyways, we met-cute
on the outskirts of Ogreland.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.211
<i>Me driving my candy wagon,</i>

10:29.295 --> 10:31.464
<i>her just coming back from shopping.</i>

10:31.547 --> 10:33.966
<i>It was love at first sight…</i>

10:35.176 --> 10:36.510
<i>…for one of us.</i>

10:40.890 --> 10:42.641
But us elves don't ever give up.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.353
Except for Quito. That's all he ever did!

10:46.437 --> 10:49.106
But Stabo got him. He got him good.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.691
- Pops--
- But like I was saying…

10:50.775 --> 10:53.569
<i>Me and Barko waited every day</i>
<i>with a different candy.</i>

10:59.033 --> 11:00.451
<i>But no luck.</i>

11:03.746 --> 11:05.039
<i>Then I hit on it.</i>

11:05.122 --> 11:07.208
<i>It weren't me, it were the candy.</i>

11:07.291 --> 11:08.918
<i>Ogres don't dig sweets.</i>

11:09.001 --> 11:12.380
<i>So, I whipped up</i>
<i>a special flavor just for her.</i>

11:12.963 --> 11:16.300
<i>Sour it was. Just enough</i>
<i>to give your mouth a pucker.</i>

11:21.597 --> 11:23.432
Ah…

11:24.058 --> 11:25.726
<i>Pucker up, we did.</i>

11:27.895 --> 11:29.271
Oh, Grogda!

11:29.355 --> 11:31.273
Oh, Young Pops!

11:31.357 --> 11:33.943
<i>From that day on,</i>
<i>I was her candy man.</i>

11:34.026 --> 11:37.571
<i>We kept things on the down low</i>
<i>'cause her parents wouldn't approve.</i>

11:37.655 --> 11:40.408
<i>Turns out, neither did her</i>
<i>cuss-ugly boyfriend.</i>

11:41.742 --> 11:44.453
Well, sir, you'll never guess
what happened next.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.289
Oh, yeah!

11:47.373 --> 11:49.333
Please, skip ahead.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.836
What are you, a prude?
You don't like to think about…

11:51.919 --> 11:53.671
- Oh…

11:55.423 --> 11:56.507
Oh, my God.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.427
- Pops!

12:00.010 --> 12:02.388
Well, well, what's it say?

12:02.888 --> 12:05.057
- A blue line.
- Holy moly!

12:05.141 --> 12:07.935
Either you're pregnant
or that candy cane is rotten.

12:08.436 --> 12:12.106
<i>We knew there was no future for us</i>
<i>in Ogreland except for death.</i>

12:12.189 --> 12:13.899
<i>So, we waited till nightfall.</i>

12:16.235 --> 12:18.320
<i>Then, I gave the signal.</i>

12:18.404 --> 12:19.947
- <i>Ugh!</i>

12:23.409 --> 12:24.452
Oh!

12:43.012 --> 12:44.138
Look at him go.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.348
Oh!

12:46.432 --> 12:47.683
Glad that ain't me.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.900
<i>I couldn't bring Grogda to Elfwood,</i>

12:55.983 --> 12:58.277
<i>and we sure as heck couldn't</i>
<i>go back to Ogreland.</i>

12:58.360 --> 13:00.696
<i>So, we made a happy home with the flies</i>

13:00.780 --> 13:03.783
<i>and the mosquitoes</i>
<i>and the scorpions of the jungle.</i>

13:08.871 --> 13:12.374
<i>We hid in the trees</i>
<i>from the most vicious creatures around.</i>

13:14.168 --> 13:15.085
Gnomes!

13:15.169 --> 13:17.171
Hup! Hup! Hup!

13:18.047 --> 13:20.591
<i>Oh, she was the love of my life.</i>

13:20.674 --> 13:21.759
<i>Had me flying high.</i>

13:23.636 --> 13:26.597
<i>It wasn't long after this</i>
<i>that you came along.</i>

13:30.184 --> 13:31.435
Look at him, Pops.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.479
Yeah, I'll love him, anyway.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.525
<i>You was a real scamp.</i>

13:37.608 --> 13:40.736
<i>Always getting into mischief</i>
<i>like your old man.</i>

13:40.819 --> 13:42.571
Look at me, Daddy Elfo.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.658
That's nice, boy,
but my name is Pops.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.869
You call me Daddy Elfo again,
and I'll slap you on the bum-bum.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.747
<i>Every time I said that,</i>
<i>you shut up but good.</i>

13:51.831 --> 13:54.083
<i>Oh, I wanted to name you Scampo</i>

13:54.166 --> 13:57.044
<i>- or Spunko or Spanko or Stinko…</i>

13:57.127 --> 13:58.671
…<i>but your mom wouldn't have it.</i>

13:58.754 --> 14:01.507
<i>She wanted you</i>
<i>to be proud of being part elf.</i>

14:07.805 --> 14:09.848
Go on, tell me who you are.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.518
Hi, I'm Elfo.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.397
- Hi, Elfo.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.648
Say it again.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.693
- Hi, I'm Elfo.
- Again.

14:20.776 --> 14:26.615
Stop. Stop. Stop!

14:26.699 --> 14:27.908
Stop it!

14:54.018 --> 14:57.396
Wow, I'm kind of starting to make sense.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.731
Eh, not to me, you ain't.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.984
You was always off
in your own world, God bless you.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.403
Even on that fateful day.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.202
- Huh?

15:16.540 --> 15:18.918
Hey! That's my diaper, you thief!

15:24.506 --> 15:27.051
<i>It looked hopeless,</i>
<i>but you never gave up.</i>

15:55.913 --> 15:57.539
- You take Elfo and hide.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.458
I'll meet you
back at the treehouse.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.554
- Oh, my boy.

16:12.638 --> 16:16.350
What I'm about to tell you
is the hardest thing I've ever had to say.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.935
- I love you?
- Hell no!

16:18.018 --> 16:20.104
Got to save something for my deathbed.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.939
It's about what happened to your mama.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.023
What is it?

16:23.107 --> 16:25.609
<i>Your mom was</i>
<i>a powerful, big warrior.</i>

16:25.693 --> 16:29.029
<i>Unfortunately, she was also</i>
<i>a powerful, big target.</i>

16:29.113 --> 16:31.115
- No!
- Quiet.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.283
Don't make me smack you on the bum-bum.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.079
Oh!

16:38.247 --> 16:39.164
Ow!

16:39.248 --> 16:40.082
Mama!

16:40.165 --> 16:41.208
Hmm?

16:42.126 --> 16:42.960
Hmm.

16:45.546 --> 16:48.132
- <i>They was onto us, the gnomes.</i>
- <i>Because of me.</i>

16:48.215 --> 16:49.508
Of course, because of you!

16:49.591 --> 16:51.677
Don't know
where you learnt to talk so much.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.512
- Uh…
- Now, as I was saying…

17:00.060 --> 17:03.230
Oh, them's my britches,
you sons of bitches.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.983
- Sons of bitches!

17:16.785 --> 17:18.871
Daddy Elfo! Daddy Elfo!

17:18.954 --> 17:20.914
Are the flaming monkeys okay?

17:33.677 --> 17:34.720
<i>Our home was gone,</i>

17:34.803 --> 17:38.223
so I took you back to Elfwood,
the only safe place I knew.

17:38.307 --> 17:42.061
And rest her soul,
that was the last I saw your mother.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.437
Until now.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.232
- Grogda?
- Oh, Pops.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.026
I never thought this day would come.

17:49.109 --> 17:51.487
I thought you was dead.
The gnomes killed you.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.656
I seen it… The blood.
Flaming arrow right in your heart.

17:54.740 --> 17:59.536
- Pops, it was you that saved me.
- I did?

17:59.620 --> 18:03.248
<i>Things were going great.</i>
<i>I was even having a little fun.</i>

18:15.052 --> 18:16.887
<i>The arrow didn't hit my heart.</i>

18:16.970 --> 18:18.889
<i>It hit the candy box.</i>

18:18.972 --> 18:20.349
<i>And that wasn't blood.</i>

18:20.432 --> 18:22.810
<i>It was sour cherry syrup.</i>

18:24.019 --> 18:25.729
<i>I ran as fast as I could.</i>

18:29.691 --> 18:33.237
Pops? Little Elfo? Barko?

18:37.533 --> 18:38.617
It can't be!

18:40.035 --> 18:43.664
Oh, Elfo! Oh, Pops!

18:43.747 --> 18:45.040
The monkeys.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.836
I dusted myself off,
went back to my old life in Ogreland

18:48.919 --> 18:50.129
and married Brock.

18:50.212 --> 18:53.882
But not a day went by that I didn't
think of my little jungle boys.

18:53.966 --> 18:54.967
Aw!

18:57.970 --> 19:00.180
I've been dreaming of this moment forever.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.349
And now that you're here, Mom and Dad…

19:02.432 --> 19:03.851
Wow.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.061
It feels so weird to say that.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.480
Mom. Dad.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.524
Mom…

19:10.607 --> 19:12.901
Dad…

19:12.985 --> 19:15.654
Mom…

19:15.737 --> 19:18.323
- Dad… Whoa!

19:24.163 --> 19:27.332
This is shaping up
to be a pretty good Monday.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.132
Time for death.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.842
- Grab the elf!
- Stop, Brock.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.468
He's not just an elf.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.597
He's my son
and a member of the royal line.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.682
You cannot kill the heir to the throne.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.809
But what about me, Mom?

19:45.893 --> 19:49.146
I your son. I next in line for king.

19:49.229 --> 19:52.399
Oh, my God. Junior!

19:52.482 --> 19:53.942
You're my brother!

19:54.026 --> 19:56.737
Me know this elf. Me challenge.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.572
We fight to death.

19:58.655 --> 19:59.531
No, Junior, honey.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.534
You may be queen,
but a challenge has been made.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.453
You want me to fight my brother?

20:04.536 --> 20:05.370
- Yes!
- Yes!

20:05.454 --> 20:06.455
Piece of cake.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.707
That's my request for my last meal.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.672
Dating is really hard when you're a demon.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.925
All the good ones
are either possessed, undead,

20:18.008 --> 20:19.676
or run away the second I open my mouth.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.553
There was one guy
who had real potential, though.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.680
His name was Porky,
and he was so handsome.

20:23.764 --> 20:27.476
But he never talked about his feelings
or really talked at all.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.102
Hey, Luci?

20:29.186 --> 20:31.230
It's me, Stacianne LeBlatt.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.899
We had that date
in the guano cave, remember?

20:33.982 --> 20:35.734
Uh, you look different somehow.

20:35.817 --> 20:38.487
I know what it is. You got wings!

20:38.570 --> 20:40.572
Do you still make that adorable noise?

20:41.823 --> 20:43.617
Hah! That's the one.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.703
Look at that majestic flock of birds.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.497
Isn't nature beautiful?

20:48.580 --> 20:49.456
- Oh!

20:49.539 --> 20:50.707
What the hell?

20:52.876 --> 20:54.670
Wait. Stop! That's my body!

20:57.381 --> 20:58.507
Oh!

21:00.759 --> 21:02.094
Gotcha!

21:03.053 --> 21:04.805
Oh, this one's feeling frisky.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.598
Okay, I'll do the soul. You get the head.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.558
One, two, three.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.189
Wow, I do have a nice butt.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.692
- Not bad.
- Whoa!

21:18.277 --> 21:19.903
Welcome back, friend.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.697
Sorry. I'll fix it.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.158
No, no, no. Jerry, hammer down.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.660
I'm good. Really.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.537
Lefty-loosey, tighty-righty.

21:31.665 --> 21:32.749
Ta-da!

21:37.254 --> 21:39.298
Mom, you've got to help me.

21:39.381 --> 21:42.134
I'm so sorry, Elfo. This is all I can do.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.719
Your weapons from the jungle.

21:43.802 --> 21:47.347
Oh, my toy daggers.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.391
What am I, three? Jesus Christ.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.727
What? No, I love 'em.
They're great. Thank you.

21:51.810 --> 21:56.106
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Yeah, I'll put 'em in my, um, bookshelf

21:56.189 --> 21:58.066
of things that I never need or look at.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.527
Hey, son, if it's any consolation,

22:00.610 --> 22:02.154
I got great seats!

22:09.411 --> 22:10.620
Yami, hit the gong.

22:26.636 --> 22:30.098
Come on, Junior.
You're pummeling like a gnome.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.867
We shouldn't be fighting.

22:48.950 --> 22:51.286
- We're brothers.
- Brothers always fight.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.538
- Time-honored trope.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.499
But not to the death.

22:55.582 --> 22:58.085
You stab me eye with knife.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.711
Ruin art career.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.630
Your work was derivative, Junior.

23:01.713 --> 23:02.547
Now, kill him!

23:04.424 --> 23:06.385
- I try, Dad!

23:06.468 --> 23:07.719
Stop yelling me!

23:09.262 --> 23:11.223
Come on, Junior. Earn my love.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.837
- What?

23:44.673 --> 23:45.507
Attaboy.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.260
I always knew you couldn't do it,
but you showed me.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.971
This fight is over. No one needs to die.

23:51.054 --> 23:53.515
Yes, they do. Rules are rules.

23:53.598 --> 23:54.808
But he's your son.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.894
Not anymore.
He's a big old disappointment.

23:57.978 --> 23:58.979
Kill him already.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.943
Please no stab face.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.955
I don't wanna hurt you, Junior.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.082
I wanna help you. You're family.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.500
That's my wimp.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.962
Put it back. Put it back!

24:25.046 --> 24:27.841
And the big brother
protects his little brother,

24:27.924 --> 24:29.676
even if he is way bigger.

24:29.759 --> 24:32.262
Quick, Junior.
Take advantage of his compassion.

24:32.345 --> 24:33.889
Kill the elf now!

24:33.972 --> 24:35.891
No. Elfo right.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.726
Me no kill nobody.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.394
Throw weapon away.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.236
What? Who I kill?

24:48.320 --> 24:50.405
Don't worry about it. Just some jerk.

24:50.489 --> 24:51.823
It Dad, wasn't it?

24:51.907 --> 24:53.533
Hmm. Me happy now.

24:54.951 --> 24:57.787
Chasing brother
better than killing brother.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.790
I'll make it easy for you.

25:00.874 --> 25:03.126
- I just farted.

25:06.713 --> 25:09.716
Looks like the boys
are having good, clean fun.

25:09.799 --> 25:11.593
How's about you and me don't.

25:19.726 --> 25:22.521
Oh, there's something
you don't see every day.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.940
A wrinkled old elf humping an ogre.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.274
Elf? Where?

25:26.942 --> 25:29.361
Elfo, we'll save you!

25:34.074 --> 25:35.242
Elfo!

25:35.325 --> 25:37.994
I'm standing perfectly still, dum-dum.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.039
Elfo!

25:42.165 --> 25:43.667
Boy, where are you going?

25:46.419 --> 25:49.005
Hey, Pops.
We'll swing around and get you next.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.007
No, that's okay, girlie.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.008
I like it here.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.260
What's going on?

25:53.343 --> 25:55.971
Just some of
Elfo's buddies. He'll be fine.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.644
It's sour candy, just like you like it.

26:02.727 --> 26:03.937
Two decades old.

26:04.020 --> 26:08.650
Aw, they're stuck together
in a clump, just like you and me.

26:14.197 --> 26:17.701
Elfo! Elfo!
