WEBVTT

00:01.636 --> 00:03.702
Maybe people should just do their jobs.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.926
Maybe they'd do them better

00:05.928 --> 00:08.941
if their work environment
was a little more harmonious.

00:09.316 --> 00:11.116
Lincoln, wait for backup.

00:11.118 --> 00:12.417
He's always been Lincoln-y,

00:12.419 --> 00:14.319
even before he was in that chair.

00:14.321 --> 00:16.922
His problem is that he lost
to the Bone Collector,

00:16.924 --> 00:18.523
and he cannot accept that.

00:18.525 --> 00:20.659
- Dad?
- If I go after him again...

00:20.661 --> 00:23.195
We're thousands of miles away, Lincoln.

00:23.197 --> 00:24.596
Rachel's gonna find out.

00:24.598 --> 00:27.132
Make sure she hears it from you first.

00:27.134 --> 00:29.341
I looked into the phone
the Bone Collector used

00:29.343 --> 00:30.667
in the surveillance footage.

00:30.669 --> 00:33.538
I think we can safely extrapolate
where this path is heading.

00:33.540 --> 00:35.173
To the greatest city in the world.

00:35.175 --> 00:37.008
It's good to be home.

00:42.783 --> 00:47.118
Profile by Laura S. Cutter, FBI.

00:47.120 --> 00:50.288
Our suspect is likely a white male.

00:50.290 --> 00:52.390
30s to early 50s.

00:54.127 --> 00:56.795
A uniquely organized killer.

01:00.133 --> 01:02.367
He's killed 15 victims,

01:02.369 --> 01:04.236
both male and female,

01:04.238 --> 01:06.972
across racial and socioeconomic lines.

01:09.476 --> 01:12.177
He sees victims as unworthy objects.

01:22.356 --> 01:24.489
Even his name, the Bone Collector,

01:24.491 --> 01:27.863
is coined from his own
disrespect of humanity.

01:28.529 --> 01:32.030
Unlike Bundy, Dahmer, or Gacy,

01:32.032 --> 01:34.933
he doesn't seem to derive
any sexual pleasure

01:34.935 --> 01:37.536
or physical thrill
from the violence itself.

01:39.740 --> 01:41.540
It's about the control.

01:41.542 --> 01:43.074
He doesn't hide his crimes.

01:43.076 --> 01:45.343
He displays them with great effort

01:45.345 --> 01:48.580
to engage the police in the process...

01:48.582 --> 01:54.223
the game, whereby he will show
he is better than us,

01:54.688 --> 01:56.516
that he wins...

01:57.190 --> 01:58.924
that he's the best.

01:58.926 --> 02:02.861
This... is about ego.

02:02.863 --> 02:04.396
What's about ego?

02:05.766 --> 02:08.066
What are you doing up?
It's, like, 5:00 a.m.

02:08.512 --> 02:10.401
What? You can't tell me?

02:11.471 --> 02:12.737
Nothing.

02:12.739 --> 02:14.573
You know, it's...

02:14.575 --> 02:18.376
just another one of Lincoln's old cases.

02:18.378 --> 02:19.444
Okay.

02:19.446 --> 02:20.946
Well, then tell him it can wait.

02:20.948 --> 02:22.447
I'll try that.

02:22.449 --> 02:24.716
If there's anything Lincoln loves,

02:25.245 --> 02:26.211
it's waiting.

02:27.721 --> 02:28.987
Kay.

02:36.063 --> 02:37.762
Hey. Everything okay?

02:37.764 --> 02:39.564
It's time.

02:39.566 --> 02:40.899
He's back.

02:40.901 --> 02:41.900
Really?

02:41.902 --> 02:42.968
I mean,

02:42.970 --> 02:44.402
it's him for sure?

02:44.404 --> 02:45.904
A murder was reported an hour ago

02:45.906 --> 02:47.739
at a library across town.

02:47.741 --> 02:49.574
Evidence displayed deliberately.

02:49.982 --> 02:52.883
Victim left in an apparatus
which led to his demise...

02:54.348 --> 02:55.914
Holding a copy of my book.

02:57.818 --> 02:59.484
Sellitto and Eric are already there.

02:59.486 --> 03:00.452
I see.

03:00.454 --> 03:02.420
The first of three victims.

03:02.422 --> 03:04.322
Which means if we don't move fast,

03:04.324 --> 03:06.191
two more innocent people die today

03:06.193 --> 03:08.326
and he disappears again.

03:08.328 --> 03:10.428
Right. Kill and retreat.

03:10.430 --> 03:12.430
He's in New York for one reason:

03:12.432 --> 03:14.219
to play his game with me.

03:14.534 --> 03:16.434
You're my eyes and ears, Amelia.

03:16.436 --> 03:18.473
I need you out there right now.

03:19.673 --> 03:21.101
Lincoln...

03:21.708 --> 03:24.943
if he's back and he knows where we are...

03:24.945 --> 03:26.657
I need your head in the game right now.

03:26.659 --> 03:27.910
Your full mind.

03:27.912 --> 03:29.781
So a personal security guard
is already on his way

03:29.783 --> 03:30.982
to your place.

03:30.984 --> 03:32.050
He's Special Forces.

03:32.052 --> 03:33.852
He's good.

03:33.854 --> 03:35.787
And believe me,

03:35.789 --> 03:38.056
no one is getting near your sister today.

03:40.127 --> 03:41.626
Thank you, Lincoln.

03:41.628 --> 03:43.628
No. You can thank me by
getting to that crime scene.

03:43.630 --> 03:45.397
Yeah. On my way.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.134
The game's already begun.

03:54.374 --> 03:55.874
There's no ID.

03:55.876 --> 03:58.076
We need to figure out who this victim is.

03:58.078 --> 03:59.310
I know who he is.

03:59.312 --> 04:00.378
Wait. What?

04:00.380 --> 04:01.479
Dr. Robert Banks.

04:01.481 --> 04:03.314
Professor of U.S. history at CUNY.

04:03.316 --> 04:05.250
My alma mater.

04:05.252 --> 04:07.852
Only person ever to flunk me in a class.

04:07.854 --> 04:09.888
History, of all things.

04:09.890 --> 04:11.756
Made me study out of spite.

04:11.758 --> 04:13.992
Became my mentor.

04:13.994 --> 04:16.156
Put me on a path to all this.

04:17.449 --> 04:19.230
I'm so sorry, Lincoln.

04:19.232 --> 04:20.331
Me too.

04:21.702 --> 04:24.069
Make sure I speak to
his family when this is over.

04:24.071 --> 04:26.504
Right now, there are three
clues left here for us.

04:26.506 --> 04:28.373
We need them to save the next victim.

04:30.043 --> 04:33.545
I see a few of them.

04:33.547 --> 04:35.547
The victim regurgitated
something on himself.

04:35.549 --> 04:37.015
Maybe that's our third.

04:37.017 --> 04:38.950
I'm gonna talk to the building manager,

04:38.952 --> 04:40.518
figure out how on Earth someone managed

04:40.520 --> 04:42.120
to get this body down here
to play mad scientist.

04:42.122 --> 04:44.389
And nobody saw nothing?

04:56.436 --> 04:58.136
- He reeks.
- Vomit tends to.

04:58.138 --> 04:59.304
Of alcohol.

04:59.306 --> 05:00.371
Did your professor drink?

05:00.373 --> 05:01.639
Not like this.

05:01.641 --> 05:04.409
He always liked
perfect control of his mind.

05:04.411 --> 05:06.077
I see why you two got along.

05:09.883 --> 05:10.882
What's in the IV?

05:10.884 --> 05:13.585
Well, it's not your
typical saline solution.

05:13.587 --> 05:16.755
It's something called tetrodotoxin.

05:18.658 --> 05:21.292
It's a neurotoxin found in pufferfish.

05:21.294 --> 05:24.062
Intravenous injection
would have paralyzed him.

05:24.064 --> 05:27.932
If liquor were poured down
his throat, he couldn't move.

05:27.934 --> 05:29.167
And without a gag reflex

05:29.169 --> 05:31.469
or the ability to cough up the alcohol,

05:31.471 --> 05:32.904
he would gradually drown.

05:32.906 --> 05:35.473
- He was paralyzed.
- We've established that.

05:35.475 --> 05:39.310
No. I mean this entire scene
is aimed at you, Lincoln.

05:39.312 --> 05:41.412
Your professor.

05:41.414 --> 05:42.947
Your book.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.415
Paralysis.

05:44.417 --> 05:46.184
Like I said, this gets personal.

05:52.092 --> 05:54.259
Little early for video games.

05:54.261 --> 05:56.094
Naia, I have to ask you.

05:56.096 --> 05:57.549
Where's Camden?

05:58.431 --> 05:59.864
At basketball camp.

05:59.866 --> 06:02.534
Since when is he playing basketball?

06:02.536 --> 06:05.270
Since a few months ago
when he made the AAU team.

06:05.272 --> 06:08.306
Competitive basketball, and
no one thought to mention this?

06:08.308 --> 06:10.353
Maybe he was...

06:11.311 --> 06:13.478
protecting your feelings?

06:13.480 --> 06:15.180
Knowing he can't
shoot hoops with his dad.

06:15.182 --> 06:17.182
Naia, please listen carefully.

06:17.184 --> 06:18.616
I need you to pick him up.

06:18.945 --> 06:21.386
I'm sending someone to watch your place.

06:21.388 --> 06:23.021
So he's back.

06:23.023 --> 06:24.522
He's in New York.

06:24.524 --> 06:26.157
He won't be anywhere near you,
at least not today,

06:26.159 --> 06:27.959
but I'm not taking any chances.

06:27.961 --> 06:30.829
Please get Camden?

06:30.831 --> 06:32.250
I will.

06:32.699 --> 06:34.499
Be careful, Lincoln.

06:36.136 --> 06:37.547
I will.

06:45.821 --> 06:53.823
Synced & corrected

06:58.460 --> 07:00.228
The library.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.787
Surveillance?

07:01.812 --> 07:03.278
Witnesses?

07:03.333 --> 07:05.400
I can't imagine he just
walked in the front door.

07:05.402 --> 07:06.534
Side door.

07:06.536 --> 07:08.836
And there was a power surge
just before closing time.

07:08.838 --> 07:11.406
All systems, including
the limited security footage,

07:11.408 --> 07:13.416
went dark for ten minutes.

07:13.910 --> 07:16.044
And no witnesses, per usual.

07:16.046 --> 07:18.513
Your professor was alone, apparently.

07:18.515 --> 07:20.014
Staying late grading papers.

07:20.016 --> 07:22.917
"There's always work to
be done," he used to say.

07:22.919 --> 07:24.852
I'll get the unis to circle back

07:24.854 --> 07:25.720
with the properties on that block,

07:25.722 --> 07:27.855
see if anyone or their security cam

07:27.857 --> 07:29.424
saw anything before the blackout.

07:29.426 --> 07:30.892
I'll check with the university,

07:30.894 --> 07:32.694
get the professor's
schedule from yesterday.

07:32.696 --> 07:34.662
While you're at it, run
anyone I mentioned by name

07:34.664 --> 07:36.164
in my book.

07:36.166 --> 07:38.366
If they're in the city,
send a uni as a precaution.

07:38.368 --> 07:39.834
Let's go.

07:43.039 --> 07:47.008
Why do you think he
left a copy of your book?

07:47.877 --> 07:49.410
You said it. This is about me.

07:49.412 --> 07:51.379
This time is different.

07:51.381 --> 07:52.880
Is it?

07:52.882 --> 07:54.215
He's been playing this game with me

07:54.217 --> 07:55.883
since I figured out
his three-clue pattern

07:55.885 --> 07:57.018
the night of the very first murders.

07:57.020 --> 07:59.787
Maybe he's been playing
with you, but up until today,

07:59.789 --> 08:02.290
the victims weren't about you,
the clues weren't about you.

08:02.292 --> 08:05.059
- What are you saying?
- I am saying he's changing the rules.

08:05.061 --> 08:06.345
Well, he doesn't change the rules.

08:06.347 --> 08:07.441
Then why the book?

08:07.443 --> 08:08.696
I don't know.

08:08.698 --> 08:10.798
What I do know is there are
two victims we can find

08:10.800 --> 08:12.233
by triangulating the clues.

08:12.235 --> 08:14.535
The dollar bill, the stomach contents,

08:14.537 --> 08:16.070
and whatever that white fragment is.

08:16.072 --> 08:18.206
Those are his rules.
That's what we focus on.

08:21.244 --> 08:23.411
Amelia, you've got a terrible poker face.

08:23.413 --> 08:24.545
Just say what's on your mind.

08:24.547 --> 08:25.739
Okay.

08:26.750 --> 08:29.984
Maybe the game itself is the problem.

08:29.986 --> 08:31.819
Hmm? It's always the same.

08:31.821 --> 08:33.254
He throws. You swing.

08:33.256 --> 08:34.956
If we don't play the game, people die.

08:34.957 --> 08:36.924
15. I know. 16, if we...

08:36.926 --> 08:38.558
I'm aware of the score.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.094
Look, I am sorry.

08:40.096 --> 08:44.432
I'm just saying,
you are always on defense.

08:47.103 --> 08:49.470
Have you ever thought
about going on offense?

08:49.472 --> 08:51.939
I've been thinking about
this for eight years,

08:51.941 --> 08:53.941
three of them stuck in this chair.

08:53.943 --> 08:56.110
We've tried every way.

08:56.112 --> 08:57.812
Playing his game is the only way

08:57.814 --> 08:59.814
we've ever gotten close to him.

08:59.816 --> 09:01.316
We just have to win.

09:01.318 --> 09:02.350
Okay.

09:05.455 --> 09:07.322
I'm sure you're right.

09:14.264 --> 09:16.297
Agent Cutter?

09:16.299 --> 09:18.458
Officer Lincoln Rhyme.
You asked to see me.

09:19.202 --> 09:20.868
So you're the dog with the bone,

09:20.870 --> 09:22.470
flooding my inbox every day

09:22.472 --> 09:24.105
with your thoughts

09:24.107 --> 09:26.040
on the FBI's approach
to the Tourist Killer.

09:26.042 --> 09:27.642
Not trying to step on toes.

09:27.644 --> 09:29.711
I've just been following the case.

09:29.713 --> 09:31.096
Want to help.

09:31.681 --> 09:33.056
Well,

09:33.683 --> 09:36.017
your instincts were correct.

09:36.019 --> 09:38.720
The last victim had salt water
on the clothes and her luggage,

09:38.722 --> 09:40.521
and so did this one.

09:40.523 --> 09:41.689
How did you know?

09:41.691 --> 09:42.890
If they took the ferry on the Hudson,

09:42.892 --> 09:44.058
like I suspect,

09:44.060 --> 09:46.260
the spray from the river would
track on their clothes.

09:48.698 --> 09:50.365
All right then.

09:50.367 --> 09:51.966
Can you explain these fragments

09:51.968 --> 09:54.202
found on the victim's hair and feet?

09:57.207 --> 09:59.006
The killer's hunting ground could be

09:59.008 --> 10:00.742
any one of a half dozen tourist areas

10:00.744 --> 10:02.410
by the Hudson.

10:02.412 --> 10:04.963
Only one would explain
the Torrey's rush flower;

10:05.849 --> 10:08.675
a leaf from New Jersey's
state tree, the red oak;

10:09.652 --> 10:11.419
and what I'm guessing is a feather

10:11.421 --> 10:13.555
from the endangered northern harrier.

10:14.357 --> 10:16.724
Liberty State Park in New Jersey.

10:16.726 --> 10:19.193
Your killer could be a visitor,

10:19.195 --> 10:21.312
even pose as a tourist himself.

10:21.831 --> 10:23.731
You think he selects his targets there?

10:23.733 --> 10:24.991
Someone innocuous

10:24.993 --> 10:27.201
who crosses paths with
hundreds of tourists a day,

10:27.203 --> 10:29.203
willing to divulge their vacation plans

10:29.205 --> 10:31.406
to a complete but totally
harmless stranger,

10:31.408 --> 10:33.741
then tracks them to their hotel rooms,

10:33.743 --> 10:35.109
where they're taken from.

10:35.111 --> 10:38.163
But... that would be speculating.

10:38.782 --> 10:41.166
All the evidence says for sure is...

10:42.018 --> 10:43.710
this is where you'll find them.

10:44.921 --> 10:47.005
It's quite the theory, Officer Rhyme.

10:48.725 --> 10:50.691
But none of that fits our profile.

10:52.749 --> 10:55.129
- Got it.
- Music to my ears.

10:55.131 --> 10:56.697
Victim's vomit is mostly whiskey...

10:56.699 --> 10:57.865
a New York rye...

10:57.867 --> 11:00.234
except for a few undigested particles

11:00.236 --> 11:01.613
of turtle meat.

11:01.614 --> 11:03.580
- Turtle meat?
- How aristocratic.

11:03.582 --> 11:05.182
And inhumane.

11:05.184 --> 11:06.950
Green sea turtles are endangered.

11:06.952 --> 11:08.652
It is illegal to eat one
in the United States.

11:08.654 --> 11:11.422
We'll be sure to add that at
the Bone Collector's sentencing.

11:11.424 --> 11:12.656
In the meantime,

11:12.658 --> 11:15.292
I doubt Professor Banks was
dining on exotic reptile meat

11:15.294 --> 11:16.760
while grading papers.

11:16.762 --> 11:18.119
It's a clue.

11:18.631 --> 11:19.630
What about that white tile?

11:19.632 --> 11:20.698
Not a tile.

11:20.700 --> 11:21.965
It's ivory.

11:21.967 --> 11:23.367
From a hippopotamus tusk.

11:23.369 --> 11:24.868
Hippos have tusks?

11:24.870 --> 11:25.936
And the dollar?

11:25.938 --> 11:27.705
It's just that. One dollar.

11:27.707 --> 11:29.340
Nothing telling from the serial number.

11:29.342 --> 11:31.475
Professor's prints are on it.
Probably came from his wallet.

11:31.477 --> 11:32.810
What about my book?

11:32.812 --> 11:34.144
It came from right
off that library shelf.

11:34.146 --> 11:36.113
Wiped of all prints, of course.

11:37.983 --> 11:40.317
Let's take these clues at face value.

11:41.487 --> 11:43.354
One dollar bill,

11:43.356 --> 11:44.813
turtle meat,

11:45.358 --> 11:46.856
and ivory.

11:50.029 --> 11:51.295
It's a common misconception

11:51.297 --> 11:53.464
that Washington had wooden teeth.

11:53.466 --> 11:54.865
In fact,

11:54.867 --> 11:57.401
his dentures were made from hippo ivory.

11:57.403 --> 12:01.004
In 1783, Washington hosted
a farewell turtle feast

12:01.006 --> 12:03.707
for the officers of the Continental Army,

12:03.709 --> 12:05.075
removing his hippo dentures

12:05.077 --> 12:06.744
so he could enjoy a decadent meal

12:06.746 --> 12:08.812
at what is now the oldest operating bar

12:08.814 --> 12:10.839
in New York City.

12:11.884 --> 12:14.300
The next victim is at Fraunces Tavern.

12:15.988 --> 12:18.555
All available units to Fraunces Tavern.

12:29.201 --> 12:32.269
Hey. How was the seminar?

12:32.271 --> 12:33.937
I did my four words routine...

12:33.939 --> 12:36.073
you know, organize,
plan, commit, succeed...

12:36.075 --> 12:38.242
and I got a standing ovation at the end.

12:38.244 --> 12:41.178
Because you organized
and planned it so well?

12:41.180 --> 12:42.780
Cute.

12:42.782 --> 12:46.850
But really, it was invigorating.

12:46.852 --> 12:48.552
How's your work coming?

12:48.554 --> 12:50.120
Oh, you know,

12:50.122 --> 12:53.223
somewhere between committed
and succeeding.

12:56.762 --> 12:58.595
Hey, I'm proud of you.

12:58.964 --> 13:01.965
Why don't we do lunch at the Weybridge?

13:01.967 --> 13:04.902
Celebrate the life coach
who changed my life.

13:04.904 --> 13:06.470
I love it.

13:06.472 --> 13:08.906
And just so you hear me
say it, you were right.

13:08.908 --> 13:12.576
Coming back to New York was a great idea.

13:12.578 --> 13:14.411
I think so too.

13:14.413 --> 13:15.979
Love you.

13:15.981 --> 13:17.797
Love you, too, honey.

13:57.980 --> 13:59.146
It was horrible.

13:59.148 --> 14:01.782
His face was just... oh, my God!

14:01.784 --> 14:03.618
Looks like we're too late.

14:04.587 --> 14:05.953
I can talk to her.

14:05.955 --> 14:07.521
You're needed inside.

14:09.358 --> 14:11.091
Nobody's allowed in
without proper equipment.

14:11.093 --> 14:12.292
It's not safe.

14:12.294 --> 14:13.360
What are you talking about?

14:13.362 --> 14:14.695
The kitchen's a gas chamber.

14:14.697 --> 14:16.997
Someone unscrewed all the carbon
dioxide tanks from the taps.

14:16.999 --> 14:19.199
Let me guess.

14:19.201 --> 14:20.968
You want me to go in anyway.

14:20.970 --> 14:22.369
You set the bar high

14:22.371 --> 14:25.105
by standing in front
of a moving subway train.

14:25.107 --> 14:26.391
Let's get you suited up.

14:28.778 --> 14:31.111
Listen, if you feel a headache
or dizzy or confused...

14:31.113 --> 14:32.772
anything... you get the hell out.

14:34.049 --> 14:35.516
I work with Lincoln Rhyme.

14:35.518 --> 14:37.618
When am I not confused with a headache?

14:40.890 --> 14:42.856
Good luck.

14:57.406 --> 14:59.406
Amelia, relax.

14:59.408 --> 15:01.175
Forget about the stakes for a second.

15:01.177 --> 15:03.678
Only think about what's
right in front of you.

15:03.911 --> 15:05.644
Are you seeing what's
right in front of me?

15:05.646 --> 15:07.312
You can do this.

15:07.314 --> 15:09.414
Now, I need you to turn around

15:09.416 --> 15:10.782
and tell me what's in the victim's hand.

15:14.488 --> 15:16.488
Uh...

15:16.490 --> 15:20.153
it's your book... again.

15:20.928 --> 15:22.227
Did you know this victim too?

15:22.229 --> 15:25.825
I don't, but just in case, check his ID.

15:41.248 --> 15:44.783
Hey.

15:44.785 --> 15:46.251
He's not in your book.

15:46.253 --> 15:48.854
Collateral damage, I'm
afraid, just like the rest.

15:54.294 --> 15:55.521
Oh!

15:56.130 --> 15:58.096
I found one of the clues!

16:00.334 --> 16:02.134
There should be two more.

16:02.136 --> 16:03.935
Where are they?

16:05.873 --> 16:07.706
Oh, wait a minute.

16:07.708 --> 16:08.707
Look at his mouth.

16:10.310 --> 16:11.710
What do you want me to do?

16:11.712 --> 16:13.145
Very gently hold onto it

16:13.147 --> 16:14.713
while you open his jaw.

16:17.718 --> 16:19.384
Okay.

16:24.491 --> 16:26.057
Okay.

16:37.905 --> 16:39.638
Are you seeing this?

16:39.640 --> 16:41.339
It looks like it goes down his throat.

16:41.341 --> 16:43.241
Yes. There should be two more clues

16:43.243 --> 16:44.176
at the other end of that string.

16:44.178 --> 16:47.579
Okay, so this'll be a forensics thing,

16:47.581 --> 16:48.747
to get it out?

16:48.749 --> 16:50.015
Yeah. Pull.

16:50.017 --> 16:51.216
Lincoln,

16:51.218 --> 16:52.417
this is totally against protocol.

16:52.419 --> 16:53.919
A medical examiner should be doing this.

16:53.921 --> 16:55.253
I agree with her wholeheartedly.

16:55.255 --> 16:57.155
We can't wait on the M.E.

16:57.157 --> 16:58.990
The gastric acid is eating
away at the clues.

16:58.992 --> 17:01.159
If we lose those clues,
a third victim dies.

17:01.161 --> 17:03.195
So much for "relax and
forget about the stakes."

17:03.197 --> 17:04.930
Hurry. But do it carefully.

17:04.932 --> 17:06.565
You can't tell me to hurry

17:06.567 --> 17:08.452
and do it carefully
at the same time, Lincoln.

17:12.005 --> 17:15.339
Good. Nice and easy.

17:15.342 --> 17:16.842
Ugh.

17:16.844 --> 17:18.376
I see something.

17:19.713 --> 17:22.012
Ugh. It's stuck.

17:22.015 --> 17:23.415
- What do you mean?
- It's jammed.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.083
Wedged. Not moving.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.451
Cut it.

17:26.453 --> 17:27.953
- What? The string?
- His throat.

17:27.954 --> 17:29.454
Are you insane?

17:29.456 --> 17:30.689
A tracheotomy on a dead body

17:30.691 --> 17:33.024
is a hell of a lot better than
letting the next victim die.

17:33.026 --> 17:35.126
Lincoln, this is borderline il...

17:35.128 --> 17:36.361
We don't have a choice!

17:36.363 --> 17:39.698
Amelia, your job is to do what
I would do if I were there,

17:39.700 --> 17:41.299
and if I were there, I would
have been holding those clues

17:41.301 --> 17:43.068
five minutes ago.

17:43.070 --> 17:44.369
Now, take the knife and...

17:51.411 --> 17:53.612
Atta girl.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.349
We have the clues.

17:56.149 --> 17:57.949
That's all that matters.

18:01.488 --> 18:03.321
Easy.

18:03.323 --> 18:06.068
What'd you say about feeling dizzy?

18:08.595 --> 18:10.031
Nice work.

18:10.831 --> 18:12.797
Yeah. Take a minute.

18:12.799 --> 18:15.600
Eric's still talking
to the surrounding businesses.

18:21.842 --> 18:23.608
Any witnesses?

18:23.610 --> 18:25.977
Like a ghost, as usual.

18:25.979 --> 18:28.966
All right. I'll go get you some
water, and we'll take off.

18:29.683 --> 18:31.483
This morning, there was
a carbon dioxide leak

18:31.485 --> 18:33.285
in this establishment's kitchen,

18:33.287 --> 18:35.453
causing one fatality.

18:35.455 --> 18:36.521
The police were called to the
corner of...

18:36.523 --> 18:38.423
So we're lying to the public now?

18:38.425 --> 18:40.792
- After an employee...
- Omitting details.

18:40.794 --> 18:43.628
The mayor wants a lid on
anything Bone Collector.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.932
And you guys don't think
that might set him off?

18:46.934 --> 18:49.034
Identified as 25-year-old...

18:49.036 --> 18:50.702
We're depriving him of credit.

18:50.704 --> 18:51.803
Right.

18:51.805 --> 18:54.116
Wouldn't want him to do
anything crazy, would we?

18:59.446 --> 19:02.213
I can always tell when
you're lying, you know.

19:02.215 --> 19:04.015
You're upset about something.

19:04.364 --> 19:05.630
Honey?

19:06.720 --> 19:07.819
Sorry.

19:08.422 --> 19:10.155
I was... distracted by the news.

19:10.157 --> 19:12.991
- Horrible accident.
- No. That's not it.

19:12.993 --> 19:15.096
You're carrying so much tension.

19:15.896 --> 19:17.223
You're not yourself.

19:21.835 --> 19:24.035
Work is not going as I hoped.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.303
There. See?

19:25.305 --> 19:26.571
Now, was that so hard?

19:26.573 --> 19:29.140
- It's just...
- You're a perfectionist.

19:29.142 --> 19:32.410
You worry about what other
people think about your work,

19:32.412 --> 19:36.381
but the truth is,
recognition comes in time.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.750
If you value what you do,

19:38.752 --> 19:41.219
that's all the validation you need.

19:43.156 --> 19:44.917
You're a gift, Danielle.

19:46.259 --> 19:48.493
What have I done to deserve you?

19:48.495 --> 19:49.839
Aww.

19:50.530 --> 19:53.164
Lincoln, you mention
the tavern in your book.

19:53.166 --> 19:54.265
I know. I wrote it.

19:54.267 --> 19:56.401
Here: "I had once chased
a perp through a restaurant

19:56.403 --> 19:58.570
"and lost him, only to
realize I'd failed to check

19:58.572 --> 20:00.171
"the ladies' room he was hiding in.

20:00.173 --> 20:02.507
"This time, in Fraunces Tavern,

20:02.509 --> 20:04.109
I didn't make the same mistake."

20:04.111 --> 20:05.944
"I knocked first politely."

20:05.946 --> 20:07.379
"Then made my arrest."

20:10.384 --> 20:13.084
Much as I love a recitation of my words,

20:13.086 --> 20:14.586
I gather you're working a theory.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.254
I have been researching

20:16.256 --> 20:18.023
the previous crime scenes to this case,

20:18.025 --> 20:21.459
and I read FBI agent Cutter's
profile on the Bone Collector...

20:21.461 --> 20:23.595
I value your ambitions as a profiler.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.796
I do.

20:24.798 --> 20:27.232
But Agent Cutter was never in the
same room as the Bone Collector.

20:27.234 --> 20:29.467
She speculates based
on statistics, and...

20:29.469 --> 20:30.935
Let her finish, Lincoln.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.240
As Agent Cutter says,

20:35.242 --> 20:37.642
"View each crime scene
as a conversation."

20:37.644 --> 20:41.813
So what is the Bone Collector
trying to tell us

20:41.815 --> 20:43.448
about each new murder?

20:43.450 --> 20:46.051
He's telling us he's superior to me.

20:46.053 --> 20:47.318
I've been in his crosshairs

20:47.320 --> 20:49.654
ever since I found
his first hidden puzzle.

20:49.656 --> 20:52.624
A worthy adversary he feels
compelled to prove unworthy.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.492
He's read my book and wants to tarnish

20:54.494 --> 20:55.614
my greatest achievements

20:55.616 --> 20:57.495
by dropping innocent bodies on them.

20:57.497 --> 20:59.097
People I can't save.

20:59.099 --> 21:00.618
People I knew.

21:01.301 --> 21:02.600
Or do you see it differently?

21:02.602 --> 21:03.746
I do.

21:04.271 --> 21:06.874
I... I mean, just look at the tavern.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.624
You didn't really know that person,

21:08.626 --> 21:11.810
and was it really one
of your greatest achievements?

21:11.812 --> 21:13.178
Everyone's a critic.

21:13.180 --> 21:14.946
That's not what I meant.

21:14.948 --> 21:17.515
It's just, it's a random case

21:17.517 --> 21:19.684
in a book full of huge,
incredible anecdotes.

21:19.686 --> 21:21.853
Why that one?
I mean, you said it yourself.

21:21.855 --> 21:25.184
Everything means something
to the Bone Collector.

21:26.268 --> 21:27.959
Lincoln, I agree,

21:27.961 --> 21:30.295
he is targeting your career triumphs.

21:30.297 --> 21:32.330
But just like Agent Cutter said,

21:32.332 --> 21:34.599
this is about ego.

21:34.601 --> 21:36.034
I've read every word Agent Cutter wrote

21:36.036 --> 21:37.535
about the Bone Collector.

21:37.537 --> 21:39.270
I didn't hire you to
regurgitate research.

21:39.272 --> 21:41.339
I hired you to be my eyes and ears.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.174
My brain works just fine.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.778
Yeah, well, so does mine.

21:47.881 --> 21:49.500
I know.

21:50.450 --> 21:52.383
So use it to come up
with something actionable

21:52.385 --> 21:54.519
to help us catch
the Bone Collector today!

21:54.521 --> 21:56.387
Or else we're just wasting time.

21:56.389 --> 21:58.823
And every minute we lose today is...

21:58.825 --> 22:00.525
Is...

22:00.527 --> 22:01.659
Lincoln?

22:01.661 --> 22:02.627
- Claire!
- Hey, hey.

22:02.629 --> 22:04.229
Claire? Cl... Claire!

22:04.231 --> 22:05.330
We need you in here!

22:06.800 --> 22:07.866
He was talking one minute.
All of a sudden, he...

22:07.868 --> 22:09.467
Give him some space, please.

22:09.469 --> 22:11.069
What's happening?

22:11.071 --> 22:12.570
Call 911 now.

22:12.572 --> 22:14.539
God, your heartbeat is out of control.

22:14.541 --> 22:15.907
Stay with me, Lincoln.

22:15.909 --> 22:17.742
Stay with me, Lincoln.

22:17.744 --> 22:19.410
Stay with me, Lincoln.

22:20.981 --> 22:24.015
Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.039
Of all days.

22:27.756 --> 22:29.786
I know. I feel terrible.

22:29.811 --> 22:32.679
I mean, we were arguing,
and then the next minute...

22:32.681 --> 22:34.147
It's not your fault.

22:34.149 --> 22:35.815
Just sometimes, when he gets upset...

22:35.817 --> 22:38.340
it's autonomic dysreflexia.

22:39.258 --> 22:41.487
It's when a paralyzed person's
brain receives alerts

22:41.489 --> 22:43.590
from the body that something is wrong,

22:43.592 --> 22:46.426
but there's no way to pinpoint
the source of the problem.

22:46.807 --> 22:49.262
Everything goes haywire.

22:49.264 --> 22:51.431
To a quadriplegic, an ingrown toenail

22:51.433 --> 22:53.466
has the same urgency as a heart attack.

22:53.468 --> 22:54.968
This has happened before?

22:54.970 --> 22:56.669
Sadly, yes.

22:56.671 --> 22:59.205
Look, they'll find the source,
and he'll be fine.

22:59.207 --> 23:01.040
It's just a little mystery.

23:01.042 --> 23:03.949
High stakes.
Only a few clues to work with.

23:04.946 --> 23:08.120
You have enough of that today
without worrying about this.

23:08.984 --> 23:10.316
That's the thing.

23:11.553 --> 23:14.335
There's still a third victim out there,

23:14.990 --> 23:17.657
and I don't know how to find
them without Lincoln.

23:23.832 --> 23:25.465
- Five minutes to air.
- Mr. Deerfield?

23:25.467 --> 23:26.833
- Give me a minute, Leah.
- Hunter?

23:26.835 --> 23:27.948
What?

23:30.684 --> 23:32.338
You really need to look at this.

23:48.256 --> 23:50.423
Guess we'll be changing our lead story.

23:50.425 --> 23:52.759
I said I'm fine.

23:52.761 --> 23:54.060
It's over.

23:54.062 --> 23:56.293
I'm just doing my job, Lincoln.

23:57.065 --> 23:58.364
Hey.

23:58.366 --> 24:00.589
Where are we on victim number three?

24:01.169 --> 24:03.036
Uh, Lincoln...

24:03.038 --> 24:05.038
I'm fine. Truly.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.373
I I appreciate your concern.

24:07.375 --> 24:09.709
Now, can we try and save someone?

24:11.112 --> 24:13.046
Claire said you could have died.

24:13.048 --> 24:14.280
I... I mean the rest of us can...

24:14.282 --> 24:15.348
I get it.

24:15.350 --> 24:17.417
Yes, I could have died.

24:17.419 --> 24:18.979
That's what this man did to me.

24:18.981 --> 24:20.820
He made it so that a damn
bugbite can take my life,

24:20.822 --> 24:23.156
can prevent me from saving
someone else's life.

24:23.158 --> 24:25.458
Let me do everything I can to stop him.

24:27.829 --> 24:29.095
Can we get back to work?

24:31.533 --> 24:33.533
Okay.

24:33.535 --> 24:34.934
Kate should be here any minute, and...

24:34.936 --> 24:36.002
Glad to see you're up,

24:36.004 --> 24:38.002
but you're not gonna like this.

24:39.474 --> 24:41.841
Breaking right now: the Bone Collector.

24:41.843 --> 24:43.443
The serial killer who plagued New York

24:43.445 --> 24:45.878
for half a decade is back.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.780
NYPD will not comment, but we can confirm

24:47.782 --> 24:50.283
that two victims have
been found dead today

24:50.285 --> 24:52.218
here in New York City.

24:52.220 --> 24:53.553
And if history is any predictor,

24:53.555 --> 24:55.555
that means there's one more to come.

24:56.145 --> 24:58.191
- Someone leaked this.
- Worse.

24:58.193 --> 25:00.482
The Bone Collector sent him Polaroids

25:00.484 --> 25:03.410
of the first two victims.
Labs ran the envelope.

25:03.443 --> 25:04.642
- They got nothing.
- He's taunting us.

25:04.644 --> 25:06.877
He's gonna panic the city.

25:06.879 --> 25:08.073
I heard.

25:09.282 --> 25:12.083
I want to check
those envelopes myself, though.

25:12.085 --> 25:13.184
In the meantime,

25:13.186 --> 25:15.419
the colorful powder from
the second victim's stomach

25:15.421 --> 25:17.321
is patina, or corroded copper

25:17.323 --> 25:19.457
that's been exposed
to sulfur and oxide compounds.

25:19.459 --> 25:21.092
Also known as verdigris.

25:21.094 --> 25:23.227
Formed when bronze, brass,
or copper is weathered

25:23.229 --> 25:25.896
or exposed to seawater over time.

25:25.898 --> 25:28.068
- What else?
- Item two is a plant stem.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.320
Quercus rubra.

25:29.322 --> 25:31.135
Commonly known as northern red oak.

25:31.137 --> 25:32.136
Where from, exactly?

25:32.138 --> 25:34.305
Hacked every field study,
environmental blog,

25:34.307 --> 25:36.474
and your own notes from General 14C;

25:36.476 --> 25:39.243
cross-referenced it with
the Bone Collector sample.

25:39.245 --> 25:41.579
Shows hints of Hudson grime.

25:41.581 --> 25:42.613
Somewhere on the river.

25:42.615 --> 25:43.748
What about the knife?

25:43.750 --> 25:45.149
It's an oyster-shucking knife,

25:45.151 --> 25:46.183
which is relatively rare,

25:46.185 --> 25:47.418
but can be purchased at any store

25:47.420 --> 25:48.619
that sells kitchenware.

25:48.621 --> 25:50.655
Wiped of all prints. No barcode.

25:50.657 --> 25:53.658
Copper patina, oak leaf,
and an oyster knife.

25:53.660 --> 25:57.128
And this is gonna be
specific to you and your book.

26:00.166 --> 26:03.968
Felix, bring up a map
of New York and the Hudson.

26:03.970 --> 26:05.936
Early 1800s.

26:09.275 --> 26:11.387
Zoom in on Communipaw.

26:11.711 --> 26:14.879
It's the Lenape name
for "other side of the river,"

26:14.881 --> 26:17.615
or, as we know it, New Jersey.

26:17.617 --> 26:19.383
The land that borders the Hudson

26:19.385 --> 26:21.652
was flush with oyster beds until 1839,

26:21.654 --> 26:24.188
when the central railroad
of New Jersey was built

26:24.190 --> 26:25.456
and destroyed them.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.792
Across the river, 60 years later,

26:27.794 --> 26:29.527
Ellis Island processed immigrants

26:29.529 --> 26:31.362
greeted by Lady Liberty herself,

26:31.364 --> 26:33.130
dazzled in patina copper.

26:33.575 --> 26:35.566
Nearly 2/3 of them passed through

26:35.568 --> 26:37.468
to the New Jersey railroad terminal

26:37.470 --> 26:39.370
now known as Liberty State Park,

26:39.372 --> 26:43.040
which hosts more than 750
trees, red oak among them,

26:43.042 --> 26:45.342
as a living memorial for the residents

26:45.344 --> 26:48.846
of New Jersey who died
in the attacks on 9/11.

26:51.150 --> 26:53.637
And you want the book to mean something?

26:54.020 --> 26:56.220
Stop! NYPD!

27:12.438 --> 27:13.907
Stop moving.

27:15.007 --> 27:17.575
Hands behind your back.

27:17.577 --> 27:20.678
Like I said, follow the evidence.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.580
Liberty State Park is the location

27:22.582 --> 27:24.181
that launched my career,

27:24.183 --> 27:25.883
where I told your idol Agent Cutter how

27:25.885 --> 27:27.118
to catch the Tourist Killer.

27:27.120 --> 27:30.354
Okay. Liberty State Park. Let's move.

27:30.356 --> 27:31.455
Wait.

27:31.457 --> 27:32.623
We don't have time to wait.

27:32.625 --> 27:33.724
The clues are there. It's in the book.

27:33.726 --> 27:36.594
I know that Liberty State
Park made you famous,

27:36.596 --> 27:38.891
and I know the ending to your book,

27:39.365 --> 27:40.397
but it feels predictable.

27:40.399 --> 27:41.768
Like, it just...

27:42.301 --> 27:43.367
Lincoln, it feels too easy.

27:43.369 --> 27:45.369
- You think this was easy?
- Look, I don't know.

27:45.371 --> 27:46.570
It just feels wrong.

27:46.572 --> 27:47.571
I don't think he'd choose it.

27:47.573 --> 27:49.874
So based on your read of his personality,

27:49.876 --> 27:52.777
where should we go, Amelia,
before someone else dies?

27:59.118 --> 28:01.886
- I don't know.
- So we follow the evidence,

28:01.888 --> 28:04.054
because here's what I do know.

28:04.056 --> 28:06.924
Evidence informs the profile,
not the other way around.

28:09.762 --> 28:11.662
- Can we have a minute?
- We don't have a minute.

28:11.664 --> 28:14.231
That's what you said
to me three years ago.

28:14.233 --> 28:16.500
Ten minutes before
you entered that warehouse,

28:16.502 --> 28:18.235
you and I had this very exchange.

28:18.237 --> 28:19.278
- No.
- We did.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.571
I said, "Don't rush in there."

28:20.573 --> 28:22.139
I was right. The victim was there.

28:22.141 --> 28:23.741
I was right!

28:23.743 --> 28:24.875
I said he was setting us up.

28:24.877 --> 28:27.411
I said we need to think
before we walk into a trap.

28:27.413 --> 28:28.913
You think I should have
let that victim die!

28:28.915 --> 28:31.415
I'm saying I had a feeling
something was wrong,

28:31.417 --> 28:34.118
but you knew you were right!

28:34.120 --> 28:35.364
And here we are.

28:37.089 --> 28:41.537
So if Amelia's gut is saying
something's wrong...

28:42.595 --> 28:44.161
let's take a minute, okay?

28:44.163 --> 28:47.131
Let's take a minute. Get it right.

28:53.493 --> 28:55.801
- What?
- Um...

28:56.776 --> 28:59.109
Okay. The three clues.

28:59.111 --> 29:01.765
We know they lead to Liberty State Park.

29:02.515 --> 29:05.018
Could they mean anything else?

29:05.785 --> 29:07.451
Copper patina.

29:07.453 --> 29:08.719
Oak leaf.

29:08.721 --> 29:10.387
Oyster knife.

29:10.389 --> 29:11.822
And the book.

29:15.328 --> 29:17.862
The roof over Grand Central Terminal.

29:17.864 --> 29:18.829
Recently restored,

29:18.831 --> 29:21.966
because the copper patina
was causing leaks.

29:21.968 --> 29:25.330
Under that roof, the oldest
oyster bar in the city.

29:25.670 --> 29:29.073
The entire terminal accented
with oak leaf carvings.

29:29.075 --> 29:31.709
A symbol of the Vanderbilt family

29:31.711 --> 29:34.545
who financed the construction in 1871.

29:34.547 --> 29:37.815
Lincoln, you tracked Hans Baker there.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.850
The murderer you arrested
on the platform.

29:39.852 --> 29:41.852
The same three clues lead
to two different places.

29:41.854 --> 29:43.520
Which one is it?

29:43.522 --> 29:46.357
Uh... I... I don't know.

29:46.359 --> 29:48.359
I... I mean, not for sure.

29:48.361 --> 29:50.063
Go to Grand Central.

29:50.429 --> 29:51.996
You and Eric go to Liberty State Park.

29:51.998 --> 29:53.998
- You won't have eyes.
- Talk me through it.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.399
Go.

29:55.401 --> 29:56.667
Thank you.

30:09.138 --> 30:10.837
Talk to me.

30:10.839 --> 30:12.572
No chaos. No one seems to be...

30:12.574 --> 30:13.607
Dead?

30:13.609 --> 30:15.108
Good. We're in time.

30:15.110 --> 30:16.293
All right.

30:16.295 --> 30:17.611
Let's get all the tourists out
of the way.

30:17.613 --> 30:18.779
Let's not cause a panic.

30:18.781 --> 30:21.248
We'll corral them by the ferry,
and don't let 'em leave.

30:21.250 --> 30:22.749
All right. Let's divide and conquer.

30:22.751 --> 30:23.853
I'm gonna check the north side

30:23.855 --> 30:25.252
like when he first
saw the Tourist Killer.

30:25.254 --> 30:26.586
All right. Good.
I'll head into the terminal

30:26.588 --> 30:27.854
where he caught him.

30:31.527 --> 30:33.260
Amelia, you there?

30:34.363 --> 30:36.797
Please evacuate the terminal.

30:36.799 --> 30:38.098
I'm here.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.988
Please walk carefully to the ledges.

30:41.303 --> 30:44.604
Follow the directions
of law enforcement officers.

30:44.606 --> 30:47.707
No, I see nothing,
except a commuter's nightmare.

30:47.709 --> 30:50.043
- Where do I go?
- Go straight.

30:50.045 --> 30:53.113
Head for the platform.
That's where I got Hans Baker.

30:53.115 --> 30:56.716
Please evacuate the terminal.

30:56.718 --> 30:58.185
Sellitto, what are we looking at?

30:58.187 --> 30:59.986
Nothing yet.

31:03.428 --> 31:04.858
It's just deserted.

31:08.297 --> 31:09.534
It's not here.

31:09.536 --> 31:11.294
The clues lead here. Keep looking.

31:11.296 --> 31:13.333
There should be a passageway.
South side of the terminal.

31:13.335 --> 31:15.502
That's the only place
you haven't checked.

31:15.504 --> 31:17.170
I got it.

31:43.165 --> 31:45.232
Amelia, that's where I got him.

31:45.234 --> 31:47.467
I know. I don't see anything.

31:57.946 --> 32:00.026
Sellitto, what do you see?

32:01.450 --> 32:02.549
It's your book.

32:02.551 --> 32:03.950
I knew it.

32:03.952 --> 32:06.119
No. I mean it's your book,
but there's no body.

32:06.121 --> 32:08.021
It's got to be a misdirect.

32:08.023 --> 32:09.623
It's got to be Grand Central.

32:09.625 --> 32:10.590
Amelia, it's got to be here.

32:10.592 --> 32:12.559
But it isn't.

32:12.561 --> 32:15.295
Unless the Bone Collector's
about to arrive on a train.

32:15.297 --> 32:16.396
Keep looking.

32:16.398 --> 32:18.732
I've been too late, but
I've never failed at this.

32:18.734 --> 32:20.433
We can't be wrong.

32:23.639 --> 32:25.071
Lincoln, it's the wrong platform.

32:25.073 --> 32:26.239
No. This is where I caught him.

32:26.241 --> 32:28.041
Yes, but it's not the only time

32:28.043 --> 32:29.709
you mentioned Grand Central in your book.

32:29.711 --> 32:31.077
The suicide?

32:31.079 --> 32:32.445
The guy who jumped in front of the train.

32:32.447 --> 32:34.481
Do you remember what else
you wrote about it?

32:34.483 --> 32:37.484
What I failed to notice
was the guy on the edge.

32:37.486 --> 32:38.652
Too close to the edge,

32:38.654 --> 32:40.453
and as the train came in, he...

32:40.455 --> 32:41.988
jumped.

32:41.990 --> 32:43.390
But that wasn't a case.
That was a story about...

32:43.392 --> 32:45.425
Where you failed. Your words.

32:45.427 --> 32:47.093
You failed.

32:47.095 --> 32:50.096
This was never about him
tarnishing your success.

32:50.577 --> 32:52.599
He's reminding you of your failures.

32:54.970 --> 32:56.436
Professor Banks.

32:56.438 --> 32:58.271
He failed me in his history class.

32:58.273 --> 33:00.774
Before you made the arrest
at Fraunces Tavern,

33:00.776 --> 33:02.221
you failed to check the ladies' room.

33:02.223 --> 33:05.011
And then the suicide.
I failed to save him.

33:05.013 --> 33:06.913
Amelia, it's Track 19.

33:06.915 --> 33:08.315
Go. Now.

33:14.323 --> 33:16.189
I'm here. It looks abandoned.

33:16.191 --> 33:18.325
Very end of the platform.
That's where he jumped.

33:29.972 --> 33:31.538
Damn. We're too late.

33:34.710 --> 33:36.509
Sorry, Lincoln.

33:40.649 --> 33:42.148
We tried everything.

33:46.822 --> 33:48.455
She's alive!

33:52.661 --> 33:54.307
Amelia, no!

33:54.997 --> 33:57.364
- It's okay.
- It could be a trap.

33:57.366 --> 33:59.065
- I don't see anything.
- She's still alive.

33:59.067 --> 34:01.501
That means he could be here watching.

34:06.341 --> 34:07.946
You'd do it.

34:08.310 --> 34:10.043
Lincoln, you would do it
if you were here.

34:10.045 --> 34:12.212
I know, and look at where it got me.

34:20.022 --> 34:21.554
Screw it.

34:24.326 --> 34:25.759
I got you, okay?

34:25.761 --> 34:28.027
I got you. Okay.

34:28.030 --> 34:31.898
I'm gonna push you back, okay?

34:31.900 --> 34:35.568
I got you. I got you. Shh.

34:37.572 --> 34:39.438
Okay.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.842
Okay. Okay.

34:43.844 --> 34:45.779
Breathe. Breathe.

34:45.781 --> 34:47.681
Okay. It's okay.

34:47.683 --> 34:49.716
It's okay. I know. I know.

34:53.054 --> 34:54.554
You did it, Amelia.

34:59.861 --> 35:01.561
You saved her.

35:01.563 --> 35:03.126
We did it.

35:04.433 --> 35:05.799
The paramedics are on their way.

35:05.801 --> 35:07.000
All of us.

35:10.889 --> 35:13.862
I've examined every
microscopic *** on the photos

35:14.316 --> 35:16.001
***

35:16.002 --> 35:17.449
How about the woman?

35:17.990 --> 35:21.411
AnaÃ±a Ceru she is going to make it,
but she can barely talk,

35:21.436 --> 35:22.921
she doesn't remember anything,

35:22.955 --> 35:24.955
she got off the train***

35:25.312 --> 35:28.043
- ***
- And as far as we can tell

35:28.948 --> 35:30.981
no one saw him.

35:30.983 --> 35:32.950
No one saw anything.

35:32.952 --> 35:34.385
The track was closed for repair.

35:34.387 --> 35:36.493
Security cameras went dark.

35:38.090 --> 35:40.330
But it was a win, Lincoln.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.793
I mean, for the first time,
we saved someone.

35:42.795 --> 35:45.763
It's not a win.
Two more people died today.

35:45.765 --> 35:49.506
We're not closer to finding
him, and he played me again.

35:51.003 --> 35:52.470
I was wrong,

35:52.472 --> 35:53.938
and if you hadn't seen through it...

35:53.940 --> 35:54.970
But I did.

35:56.128 --> 35:58.295
And then Sellitto convinced
you to listen,

35:58.320 --> 36:01.221
and then you figured it out.

36:01.314 --> 36:02.985
And now, he's gonna be shaken up

36:02.987 --> 36:04.787
because his game didn't work.

36:04.789 --> 36:06.856
- We beat him.
- That's what worries me.

36:07.787 --> 36:10.020
When he wins the game,
he goes dark for a year.

36:10.022 --> 36:11.861
What happens when he loses?

36:12.291 --> 36:14.024
Does he have to play again?

36:14.026 --> 36:15.125
Tomorrow?

36:15.127 --> 36:16.803
We can't let him play again.

36:16.803 --> 36:18.703
Yeah, but how do we stop him?

36:25.045 --> 36:26.911
Nice work, Officer Rhyme.

36:26.913 --> 36:28.446
Thank you.

36:31.651 --> 36:33.174
Something else?

36:33.987 --> 36:35.053
Yes.

36:35.055 --> 36:37.637
You're smart and you're good,

36:38.058 --> 36:40.358
but you're arrogant, Lincoln.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.594
But may I remind you, I had a team

36:42.596 --> 36:45.270
and we spent a long time
tracking this guy.

36:45.732 --> 36:48.333
You brought us the final piece,
and for that, I commend you,

36:48.335 --> 36:50.568
but this wasn't you alone.

36:50.570 --> 36:51.836
It was a team effort,

36:51.838 --> 36:53.905
and if you can't play on the team,

36:53.907 --> 36:55.363
you'll be good,

36:55.742 --> 36:57.615
but you'll only be so good.

37:01.415 --> 37:04.416
You said the game is
he throws and I swing,

37:04.418 --> 37:05.617
but he's not playing me anymore.

37:05.619 --> 37:07.552
He's playing us.

37:07.554 --> 37:09.387
And you're right. We had a victory today.

37:09.389 --> 37:12.130
Not a win, but a small victory.

37:12.592 --> 37:14.174
What did we learn?

37:14.728 --> 37:16.261
What helps us change the rules?

37:16.263 --> 37:19.798
Today was all about your failures,

37:19.800 --> 37:21.299
and he was throwing them in your face.

37:21.301 --> 37:24.267
So what that says to me is

37:25.071 --> 37:27.605
he's got his own failures that haunt him.

37:27.607 --> 37:28.606
Like what?

37:28.608 --> 37:30.308
Well, he hasn't failed
as the Bone Collector,

37:30.310 --> 37:34.212
but nobody starts killing
three people in a day.

37:34.214 --> 37:35.780
That's an escalation.

37:35.782 --> 37:37.282
So where did he start

37:37.284 --> 37:39.217
before he learned to get away
with everything?

37:39.219 --> 37:42.120
Before he learned not to make mistakes?

37:42.122 --> 37:43.755
Well, don't you think I've done that?

37:43.757 --> 37:45.457
We went through everything.

37:45.459 --> 37:47.292
Piled through unsolved cases for years.

37:47.294 --> 37:50.428
Yeah, but now you have a whole team here.

37:50.430 --> 37:53.965
We change the parameters,
look in different places,

37:53.967 --> 37:56.401
look at other crimes.

37:56.403 --> 37:59.070
We profile everything that we know now

37:59.072 --> 38:00.805
and we keep looking until we find him.

38:00.807 --> 38:03.007
So we find his first kill or his second,

38:03.009 --> 38:04.142
where he made a mistake.

38:04.144 --> 38:05.477
It's a good plan,

38:05.479 --> 38:06.945
but it doesn't change the game for him.

38:06.947 --> 38:08.146
He's gonna keep killing.

38:08.148 --> 38:09.747
And the city's already in a panic.

38:09.749 --> 38:12.617
Well, let's see if we can
stir up a little panic

38:12.619 --> 38:13.651
in the Bone Collector.

38:15.408 --> 38:16.507
Play offense.

38:18.992 --> 38:22.126
I'm Hunter Deerfield live
with NYPD detective

38:22.128 --> 38:24.596
Lincoln Rhyme to talk
about our breaking story:

38:24.598 --> 38:26.998
the return of the Bone Collector.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.502
So three years ago, your hunt
for the infamous serial killer

38:30.504 --> 38:34.272
left you paralyzed
and retired from the force.

38:34.274 --> 38:37.343
Today, two more New Yorkers
have been murdered,

38:37.344 --> 38:38.443
but not a third.

38:38.445 --> 38:39.644
That's right.

38:39.646 --> 38:41.279
AnaÃ±a Ceru is alive.

38:41.281 --> 38:43.214
Tonight, we beat the
Bone Collector at his game.

38:43.216 --> 38:44.682
Now, let me ask you this.

38:44.684 --> 38:47.218
For three years, he went dark.
Why is he back now?

38:47.220 --> 38:49.354
I believe he's back for one reason:

38:49.356 --> 38:52.156
to taunt me, because I'm back.

38:52.158 --> 38:53.458
But as of tonight,
he can't do that anymore.

38:53.460 --> 38:54.492
I quit.

38:54.494 --> 38:56.861
- You're quitting the case?
- No.

38:56.863 --> 38:58.696
I'm quitting the game.

38:58.698 --> 39:00.465
Because he cheats.

39:00.467 --> 39:02.066
His game is rigged.

39:02.068 --> 39:03.401
It's an elaborate distraction,

39:03.403 --> 39:05.243
so instead, I've decided...

39:06.139 --> 39:08.039
we've decided.

39:08.041 --> 39:09.240
My team and I,

39:09.242 --> 39:10.708
we're going to play a new game.

39:10.710 --> 39:13.044
So let me address
the Bone Collector directly,

39:13.046 --> 39:14.379
if he's watching.

39:14.381 --> 39:18.015
For eight years,
we let you set the rules,

39:18.017 --> 39:19.674
but now we're done.

39:19.919 --> 39:22.553
We have a new game with new rules.

39:23.052 --> 39:26.257
And all you need to know
is we're coming for you

39:26.259 --> 39:27.492
and we will find you.

39:27.494 --> 39:29.494
Thank you, Detective Rhyme.

39:29.496 --> 39:31.929
And there you have it.
A new game with new rules.

39:31.931 --> 39:34.439
The Bone Collector better watch out.

39:35.394 --> 39:37.294
How long have you known?

39:42.375 --> 39:46.534
We've been after him for a few weeks.

39:47.013 --> 39:50.415
Rach, he knows where we live.

39:50.417 --> 39:53.584
He sent a human bone to the apartment,

39:53.586 --> 39:55.253
and I didn't tell you

39:55.255 --> 39:57.422
because I wanted to protect you.

39:57.424 --> 40:00.091
Especially after everything
that you've been through.

40:00.093 --> 40:02.527
But you deserve to know what's happening,

40:02.529 --> 40:07.265
even if it scares me
as much as it scares you

40:07.267 --> 40:10.301
and even if I can't promise
it'll be okay.

40:10.303 --> 40:12.904
M... maybe you were right to lie to me.

40:12.906 --> 40:15.606
Oh, come here.

40:15.608 --> 40:18.810
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

40:18.812 --> 40:20.360
What Lincoln said...

40:22.111 --> 40:25.783
a... about the new game
and the new rules...

40:29.622 --> 40:31.355
Is that really gonna work?

40:43.837 --> 40:45.636
Hey, Dad. You're up late.

40:45.638 --> 40:48.005
Don't old people have to go to bed early?

40:48.007 --> 40:50.174
Funny man.

40:50.176 --> 40:51.676
How was basketball?

40:51.678 --> 40:53.351
It was good.

40:54.814 --> 40:56.414
Sorry I didn't tell you.

40:56.416 --> 40:57.897
It's fine.

40:58.451 --> 41:00.751
- You like it?
- I do.

41:00.753 --> 41:03.069
Glad to hear.

41:04.357 --> 41:07.992
So... something you wanted?

41:07.994 --> 41:11.536
Just to... talk to you,

41:12.699 --> 41:14.298
make sure you're good.

41:14.300 --> 41:16.267
Well, I'm good. You?

41:19.472 --> 41:20.712
Yeah.

41:21.708 --> 41:23.339
I'm good now too.
