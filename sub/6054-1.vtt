05:27.597 --> 05:29.497
Look out the window.

05:33.437 --> 05:36.429
And doesn't this remind you
of when you were in the boat?

05:38.575 --> 05:40.509
And then later that night,

05:40.610 --> 05:44.637
you were lying, looking
up at the ceiling,

05:44.748 --> 05:47.717
and the water
in your head...

05:47.818 --> 05:50.616
was not dissimilar
from the landscape,

05:50.720 --> 05:54.315
and you think to yourself,
"Why is it that the landscape...

05:54.424 --> 05:56.517
is moving,

05:56.626 --> 06:00.529
but... the boat
is still?"

06:03.668 --> 06:06.637
And also...
Where is it that you're from?

06:08.072 --> 06:11.439
- Cleveland.
- Cleveland.

06:14.879 --> 06:17.871
- Lake Erie.
- Erie.

06:17.982 --> 06:21.850
Do you have any parents
back in, uh, Erie?

06:23.521 --> 06:25.785
They passed on recently.

06:29.961 --> 06:32.794
And, uh,

06:32.897 --> 06:35.366
do you have a wife...

06:37.336 --> 06:39.236
in Erie?

06:39.338 --> 06:42.068
No.

06:42.174 --> 06:45.575
- A fiancee?
- Well, I...

06:45.677 --> 06:47.907
I had one of those,
but, um,

06:50.082 --> 06:52.016
she changed her mind.

06:54.753 --> 06:58.211
- She found herself somebody else.
- No.

07:00.092 --> 07:01.992
Yes, she did.

07:04.796 --> 07:08.756
Well, that doesn't explain...

07:08.868 --> 07:11.496
why you've come
all the way out here,

07:11.604 --> 07:13.595
all the way out here to hell.

07:16.242 --> 07:18.210
I, uh,

07:18.311 --> 07:22.771
have a job
out in the town of Machine.

07:22.882 --> 07:25.544
Machine? That's
the end of the line.

07:25.652 --> 07:28.553
- Is it?
- Yes.

07:31.157 --> 07:33.421
Well, I...

07:33.526 --> 07:36.427
received a letter...

07:38.197 --> 07:40.860
from the people at Dickinson's
Metal Works...

07:40.968 --> 07:42.868
Oh.

07:42.970 --> 07:45.131
assuring me
of a job there.

07:45.239 --> 07:47.332
Is that so?

07:47.441 --> 07:50.239
Yes. I'm an accountant.

07:50.344 --> 07:55.475
I wouldn't know,
because, uh, I don't read,

07:55.583 --> 08:00.077
but, uh, I'll tell you
one thing for sure:

08:00.187 --> 08:03.623
I wouldn't trust no words
written down on no piece of paper,

08:03.724 --> 08:08.627
especially from no "Dickinson"
out in the town of Machine.

08:08.729 --> 08:11.926
- You're just as likely
to find your own grave.

08:14.369 --> 08:17.497
Look. They're
shooting buffalo.

08:23.011 --> 08:24.979
Government says...

08:25.080 --> 08:28.846
killed a million of 'em
last year alone.

13:06.469 --> 13:10.372
Pardon me, sir. Could you please
direct me towards the office?

13:15.212 --> 13:17.112
Thank you.

13:44.108 --> 13:46.702
Excuse me.

13:46.811 --> 13:49.302
Excuse me.
How do you do, sir?

13:49.414 --> 13:51.848
I'm Bill Blake,
your new accountant from Cleveland.

13:53.217 --> 13:55.412
What the heck
are you doin' here?

13:57.288 --> 14:01.384
Well, uh, I have here
this letter...

14:01.492 --> 14:03.585
which confirms
my position here.

14:07.265 --> 14:10.792
Well, this letter
is postmarked two months ago.

14:10.902 --> 14:13.029
Makes you about
a month late.

14:13.137 --> 14:16.699
This here is Mr. Olafsen.
He's our new accountant.

14:22.548 --> 14:26.507
I'm sorry. I think
there's been some mistake.

14:27.619 --> 14:29.678
- Look, Mr. Black,
- Blake.

14:29.788 --> 14:34.748
I'm a very busy man, and Mr. Dickinson
does not pay me for idle conversation.

14:34.860 --> 14:39.763
Well, I'm sure he doesn't, but
this letter confirms my position here.

14:39.865 --> 14:43.801
Now, I've spent everything I had left after
my parent's funeral just to get here.

14:43.902 --> 14:47.930
Listen, Mr. Black,
I've got a lot of work to do here,

14:48.041 --> 14:51.067
and this ain't
my business.

14:51.177 --> 14:53.805
I'd like to speak
to Mr. Dickinson.

15:04.157 --> 15:06.625
No, I-I don't think
you want to do that.

15:06.726 --> 15:09.388
I insist on speaking
to Mr. Dickinson, sir.

15:09.496 --> 15:11.657
You insist?

15:11.765 --> 15:14.700
- I insist.
- You insist?

15:16.503 --> 15:18.403
Yes, I do.

15:22.176 --> 15:25.111
Well, go on then, lad.
There's the door.

15:28.849 --> 15:30.783
All right then.

15:30.885 --> 15:32.785
Go on then!

15:33.821 --> 15:35.721
Well, I will.

15:50.704 --> 15:53.299
Hello?

15:53.408 --> 15:55.342
Mr. Dickinson?

16:25.675 --> 16:27.575
Who the hell are you?

16:27.677 --> 16:32.011
And where did you get
that goddamn clown suit? Cleveland?

16:32.115 --> 16:35.278
Well, actually, yes, sir.

16:35.384 --> 16:37.818
I did, uh, get it
in Cleveland.

16:39.188 --> 16:41.656
What the hell are you
doin' in my office?

16:41.757 --> 16:44.487
Well, I-I-I came
to talk about my job.

16:44.594 --> 16:49.224
The only job you're gonna get in here
is pushin' up daisies from a pine box.

16:49.332 --> 16:51.391
Now get out.

16:54.504 --> 16:56.404
Thank you
very much, sir.

17:16.260 --> 17:18.490
Back to work,
Mr. Olafsen.

18:13.152 --> 18:15.052
Excuse me.

19:03.303 --> 19:05.203
Excuse me.

19:05.305 --> 19:07.205
Sorry.

19:08.908 --> 19:10.809
Pardon me, sir.

19:13.748 --> 19:15.648
Could I get
a bottle, please?

20:25.822 --> 20:28.222
We liked you better
when you was a whore.

20:31.494 --> 20:33.758
Jackass.

20:36.132 --> 20:38.259
Shit!

20:47.643 --> 20:50.169
Why don't you just
paint my portrait?

20:56.120 --> 20:58.088
I'm sorry.

20:58.188 --> 21:01.180
- Let me help here. One.
- This one's no good. No, it's ruined.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.259
- Two.
- It's no good.

21:07.097 --> 21:09.565
Oh, here. Oh!

21:11.034 --> 21:12.934
Watch yourself.

21:13.036 --> 21:15.561
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

21:15.672 --> 21:18.072
Here. Have a drink.
Would you like a drink?

21:19.343 --> 21:21.243
Thanks.

21:32.991 --> 21:34.891
I'm sorry.

21:36.694 --> 21:39.595
Would you mind walking me
away from here?

21:42.066 --> 21:44.261
- S-Sure. Sure.
- Yeah?

21:45.970 --> 21:47.870
I'll just get
my suitcase.

21:56.081 --> 21:57.981
- It's that way.
- All right.

22:00.519 --> 22:03.955
Oh, shit.

22:04.056 --> 22:08.425
I have a sneaking suspicion that that
large man back there was inebriated.

22:08.527 --> 22:11.423
- I was gonna say something, but
I don't wanna cause any trouble.

22:11.424 --> 22:12.520
No, I think it's best.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.905
That's my room.

22:24.977 --> 22:28.914
Wasn't... expecting
any visitor.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.929
- Like it?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

22:49.135 --> 22:51.399
These flowers. Gosh.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.340
They really
are something.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.875
Yeah. Thank you.

22:58.979 --> 23:00.880
You're welcome.

23:04.952 --> 23:08.410
I made them
from paper.

23:16.697 --> 23:18.597
If I ever get the money,

23:18.699 --> 23:21.327
I'd like to make them
out of cloth.

23:22.737 --> 23:25.103
Silk.

23:25.206 --> 23:27.674
And I'd put
a drop of perfume...

23:30.845 --> 23:33.178
French perfume...

23:33.282 --> 23:35.944
in each one.

23:43.692 --> 23:45.660
What does it
smell like?

23:47.429 --> 23:50.455
- Paper.
- Well, it is paper.

24:03.045 --> 24:07.278
Hey, Bill.
You got any tobacco anywhere?

24:07.383 --> 24:10.045
- No, I don't smoke.
- Damn.

24:12.555 --> 24:14.455
Ow!

24:17.427 --> 24:19.327
Oh, watch it.
It's loaded.

24:22.265 --> 24:24.256
Why do you
have this?

24:25.401 --> 24:27.392
'Cause this is America.

24:39.049 --> 24:40.983
Charlie.

24:52.396 --> 24:54.296
You know, Thel,

24:55.666 --> 24:58.100
I never wanted
to go away.

24:59.737 --> 25:02.262
I know we said
it was, uh,

25:02.373 --> 25:04.398
it was all over
and everything, but...

25:08.946 --> 25:11.244
you were always
in my heart, Thel.

25:13.118 --> 25:15.018
Always.

25:17.155 --> 25:19.350
I, uh...

25:19.457 --> 25:21.482
I brought you, uh...

25:21.593 --> 25:25.723
Well, it's a present.

25:32.470 --> 25:34.631
A present?

25:34.739 --> 25:36.639
Well, I, uh...

25:38.543 --> 25:40.443
I'm... I'm goin'.

25:42.047 --> 25:44.311
And, uh,

25:44.416 --> 25:48.877
I'm... I'm sorry, Thel,

25:50.456 --> 25:52.390
for, uh,

25:53.893 --> 25:55.793
for intrudin'.

25:58.330 --> 26:00.890
Well, I never really
loved you anyway.

26:06.439 --> 26:08.339
No, Charlie.

26:10.376 --> 26:12.867
- I never stopped lovingly, Thel.
- Don't!

26:52.587 --> 26:54.487
Thel.

28:35.559 --> 28:38.255
Here's white man's metal
next to your heart.

28:38.362 --> 28:41.456
I tried to cut it out,
but it's too deep inside.

28:44.902 --> 28:46.961
A knife would cut
your heart instead...

28:47.071 --> 28:49.335
and release the spirit
from within.

28:51.375 --> 28:53.673
Stupid fucking white man.

29:11.930 --> 29:13.795
Do you have any tobacco?

29:15.400 --> 29:17.425
I don't smoke.

29:51.537 --> 29:54.802
Hey, Wilson,
got any extra tobacco?

29:54.907 --> 29:59.173
Well, of course you wouldn't have
any extra tobacco. How 'bout you?

30:02.181 --> 30:04.979
Shit. You ain't even
old enough to smoke.

30:28.442 --> 30:30.603
Mr. John Dickinson.

30:39.886 --> 30:43.288
Last night,
my youngest son, Charlie...

30:43.391 --> 30:45.325
God bless his soul...

30:45.426 --> 30:50.056
was gunned down in cold blood
right here in our own hotel.

30:50.164 --> 30:55.534
The gutless murderer, one Mr. Bill Blake,
also shot to death Miss Thel Russel,

30:55.636 --> 30:58.605
the fiancée
of my beloved son.

30:58.706 --> 31:03.643
Not only that, but he stole
a very spirited and valuable horse,

31:03.745 --> 31:09.081
a beautiful young pinto that belonged
to my personal family stable.

31:09.183 --> 31:13.985
Hell, only, a pinto ain't rightly a horse to
fret much about, if the truth be told.

31:14.089 --> 31:16.387
Shut up!

31:28.337 --> 31:32.398
You three are supposed to be
the finest killers of men and Indians...

31:32.508 --> 31:35.102
in this here
half of the world.

31:35.210 --> 31:39.840
Cole Wilson,
your reputation is already a legend.

31:39.948 --> 31:42.678
You I know I can trust.

31:42.785 --> 31:46.688
Conway Twill,you're
a real good killer,

31:46.790 --> 31:50.783
but be sure you keep
that goddamn trap shut.

31:50.894 --> 31:53.124
And Johnny
"The Kid"Pickett.

31:53.229 --> 31:56.130
I heard tell
you killed 14 men.

31:56.232 --> 31:58.325
I doubt you've seen
that many years,

31:58.435 --> 32:02.428
and I ain't even gonna tell you
what I really think of you.

32:02.539 --> 32:05.838
- I always work alone.
- Uh, excuse me there, Mr. Dickinson,

32:05.942 --> 32:10.140
but, uh, rightly I, I never
have worked with anyone else either.

32:10.246 --> 32:13.340
- I never have.
- Uh, yeah, m-me neither.

32:13.450 --> 32:15.611
Shut up!

32:16.619 --> 32:19.817
My boy Charlie is dead!

32:21.926 --> 32:26.260
Oh, I ain't askin' this time.
I'm tellin',

32:26.363 --> 32:31.699
and if somebody don't like it,
I'm prepared to do a little killin' of my own.

32:31.802 --> 32:35.738
Now, that bastard
couldn't have got too far yet.

32:35.840 --> 32:38.673
Well, why don't we just
say there, Mr. Dickinson, sir,

32:38.776 --> 32:41.574
I think we oughta start
uh, fresh in the mornin'.

32:41.679 --> 32:44.113
I mean, it's
well after noon now,

32:44.215 --> 32:47.082
and time we get finished,
all packed up and...

32:55.627 --> 32:59.063
I want him brought here to me...
alive or dead don't matter,

32:59.164 --> 33:02.156
though I reckon dead
would be easier.

33:02.267 --> 33:05.202
I'm a-hiring boys
on an exclusive basis,

33:05.303 --> 33:09.603
and I'm willing pay more money
than you've ever seen before.

33:11.743 --> 33:13.643
Boys,

33:17.549 --> 33:20.450
the hunt is on.

33:55.354 --> 33:57.379
Stupid fucking
white man.

34:35.096 --> 34:37.291
I want this out
over the wires.

34:37.398 --> 34:41.232
Post a $500 reward
from here to hell and back.

34:41.335 --> 34:46.899
Notify every marshal, deputy and
possum-skinnin' lowlife in the goddamn territory.

34:47.007 --> 34:50.034
Bring everybody in.
I want that bastard's head.

34:50.143 --> 34:54.513
And make sure you include a full description of my pinto.
I want that horse back.

34:56.083 --> 34:58.951
Goddamn pinto is a stupid damn animal.

34:59.053 --> 35:01.453
Stupid as the day
is long.

35:03.993 --> 35:07.224
Got his heart so set on one.
Buy yourself a sorrel horse...

35:07.329 --> 35:10.093
and paint some white spots on him
as far as I'm concerned.

35:10.199 --> 35:12.099
Jesus Christ.

35:12.201 --> 35:16.001
Course, ya can't put much stock in a man
who spends the most part of a conversation...

35:16.105 --> 35:18.005
talkin' to a bear.

35:19.642 --> 35:21.542
Talkin'
to a goddamn bear.

35:44.401 --> 35:47.029
The round stones
beneath the earth...

35:47.137 --> 35:49.037
have spoken
through the fire.

35:54.010 --> 35:55.910
What?

35:56.012 --> 36:00.506
Things which are alike,
in nature, grow to look alike,

36:02.285 --> 36:06.187
and the speaking stones have lain
a long time lookin' at the sun.

36:14.432 --> 36:16.366
The speaking stones?

36:16.467 --> 36:18.560
Some believe
they descend with the lightning,

36:18.669 --> 36:23.766
but I believe they are on the ground
and are projected downward by the bolt.

36:28.179 --> 36:30.579
Did you kill the white man
who killed you?

36:37.488 --> 36:39.388
I'm not dead.

36:43.528 --> 36:46.497
What name were you given
at birth, stupid white man?

36:52.003 --> 36:54.437
Blake.

36:54.539 --> 36:57.269
William Blake.

36:57.376 --> 37:00.504
Is this a lie?
Or a white man's trick?

37:00.612 --> 37:03.911
No, I'm William Blake.

37:06.585 --> 37:08.849
Then you are a dead man.

37:10.589 --> 37:12.489
I'm sorry. I d...
I don't understand.

37:14.526 --> 37:16.859
Is your name really
William Blake?

37:18.297 --> 37:20.765
Yes.

37:29.776 --> 37:32.108
Every night...

37:32.211 --> 37:34.111
and every morn',

37:35.915 --> 37:37.815
some to misery
are born.

37:41.921 --> 37:45.084
Every morn'
and every night,

37:47.160 --> 37:49.288
some are born
to sweet delight.

37:51.165 --> 37:53.099
Some are born
to sweet delight.

37:55.369 --> 37:57.701
Some are born
to endless night.

38:03.143 --> 38:06.476
I really
don't understand.

38:07.781 --> 38:10.716
But I understand,
William Blake.

38:10.818 --> 38:13.810
You were a poet
and a painter.

38:15.289 --> 38:18.383
And now, you are
a killer of white men.

38:25.633 --> 38:27.828
You must rest now,
William Blake.

38:49.157 --> 38:51.216
Some are born
to sweet delight.

38:54.096 --> 38:57.361
Some are born
to endless night.

39:03.038 --> 39:05.063
Makin' biscuits, Mommy.

39:14.483 --> 39:16.383
Sweetheart.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.991
You didn't touch it,
did you?

39:27.964 --> 39:29.864
- Huh?
- No.

39:29.966 --> 39:31.991
- You swear to me.
- I swear.

39:34.604 --> 39:36.504
Swear to me you're
tellin' the truth.

39:36.606 --> 39:38.506
Yes, I swear I'm
tellin' the truth.

39:48.151 --> 39:51.245
Not a goddamn word
to no one, ever.

39:51.354 --> 39:53.254
You understand?

39:54.524 --> 39:56.856
Don't ever ask me
no questions.

42:30.051 --> 42:31.951
Where are we?

42:33.688 --> 42:35.588
You are being followed,
William Blake.

42:36.758 --> 42:40.558
Are you sure?
I mean, how do you know?

42:45.634 --> 42:49.627
Often the evil stench
of white man precedes him.

42:54.043 --> 42:55.943
Why don't we, uh...

42:57.847 --> 43:00.315
Maybe we should, uh...

43:04.453 --> 43:07.354
What should we do?

43:07.456 --> 43:11.688
The eagle never lost so much time as
when he submitted to learn from the crow.

43:34.017 --> 43:35.917
Ever wish you were the moon?

43:37.487 --> 43:40.012
Geez, my Henry's cold.

43:40.123 --> 43:42.023
Aw, come on!

43:44.194 --> 43:46.594
My britches been open
like that how long?

43:46.696 --> 43:48.721
Only been ridin' a couple
of days together, but Jesus,

43:48.832 --> 43:50.960
one of you fellas could've
mentioned the fact that...

43:51.068 --> 43:53.502
Unsaddle
your goddamn horses.

43:55.573 --> 43:57.939
Unsaddle
your goddamn horse.

44:00.945 --> 44:02.845
Go on.

44:05.783 --> 44:09.617
- Geez.
- An Injun dug this fire pit.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.620
Oh.

44:13.291 --> 44:15.122
Oh, an Indian.

44:15.226 --> 44:17.820
We ain't trackin' no goddamn
Injuns, Cole. I mean, uh,

44:17.929 --> 44:21.262
hell, Dickinson didn't say nothin'
about trackin' no goddamn Injuns.

44:21.365 --> 44:23.300
I mean, the boy's name
is William Blake.

44:23.402 --> 44:27.065
You know a lotta Indians, do ya, named William Blake?
I mean, "Howdy, Chief Billy... "

44:27.172 --> 44:29.106
D'you hear somethin'?

44:29.208 --> 44:31.108
Huh?

44:32.878 --> 44:34.846
- Did ya?
- No. No.

44:36.281 --> 44:38.181
I guess it was nothin'.

45:01.140 --> 45:03.870
You know about Wilson?

45:03.977 --> 45:07.811
- What?
- Do you know about Cole Wilson?

45:09.916 --> 45:12.476
What kinda question is that?
'Course I know about Cole Wilson.

45:12.585 --> 45:14.951
Everybody knows about him.
He's a livin' legend.

45:15.054 --> 45:16.954
Fucked his parents.

45:20.126 --> 45:24.153
- He what?
- He fucked his parents.

45:28.167 --> 45:30.068
- Both of 'em?
- Yeah.

45:31.839 --> 45:35.297
Mother. Father. Parents.
Both of 'em. Fucked 'em.

45:39.546 --> 45:41.446
Oh.

45:43.250 --> 45:45.150
And you know
what I heard?

45:46.720 --> 45:50.622
After he killed 'em,
he cooked 'em up and ate 'em.

45:58.165 --> 46:00.759
Are you telling me
he killed both his pa...

46:00.868 --> 46:04.930
I'm tellin' you he killed 'em. He fucked 'em.
He cooked 'em up. He ate 'em.

46:07.676 --> 46:10.975
He ain't got a goddamn conscience.
You understand what I'm sayin'?

46:11.079 --> 46:15.413
He'd just as soon slit our goddamn throats
in the middle of the night as walk.

46:18.653 --> 46:21.622
Course, someone
your age,Jesus,

46:23.391 --> 46:25.291
if you was
to put one in him...

46:27.729 --> 46:31.529
"Johnny 'The Kid' Pickett
Slays Cole Wilson. "

47:00.863 --> 47:03.661
William Blake,

47:03.766 --> 47:06.064
do you know how
to use this weapon?

47:13.343 --> 47:16.676
- Not really.
- That weapon will replace your tongue.

47:19.483 --> 47:21.951
You will learn
to speak through it,

47:22.052 --> 47:25.613
and your poetry
will now be written with blood.

47:38.068 --> 47:40.002
What is your name?

47:49.514 --> 47:51.448
My name is Nobody.

47:54.018 --> 47:57.681
- Excuse me?
- My name is Exaybachay:

47:57.789 --> 48:00.758
He Who Talks Loud,
Saying Nothing.

48:04.262 --> 48:06.594
He Who Talks...

48:06.697 --> 48:09.495
I thought you said
your name was Nobody.

48:11.202 --> 48:13.262
I prefer
to be called Nobody.

48:23.182 --> 48:25.082
Nobody?

48:25.184 --> 48:29.018
Um, shouldn't you be
with your own tribe or somethin'?

48:33.392 --> 48:35.917
My blood is mixed.

48:36.028 --> 48:39.225
My mother was
Ohm gahpi phi gun ni.

48:40.599 --> 48:42.658
My father is
Abso luka.

48:45.404 --> 48:47.930
This mixture
was not respected.

48:48.041 --> 48:50.339
As a small boy,

48:50.443 --> 48:52.673
I was often left
to myself.

48:52.779 --> 48:55.976
So I spent many months
stalking the elk people...

48:56.082 --> 48:59.574
to prove I would soon
become a good hunter.

48:59.686 --> 49:03.554
One day, finally,
my elk relatives took pity on me,

49:03.656 --> 49:06.090
and a young elk
gave his life to me.

49:07.327 --> 49:10.558
With only my knife,
I took his life.

49:10.663 --> 49:15.726
As I was preparing to cut the meat,
white men came upon me.

49:15.835 --> 49:17.826
They were English soldiers.

49:17.937 --> 49:22.102
I cut one with my knife, but they
hit me on the head with a rifle.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.743
All went black.

49:25.846 --> 49:27.746
My spirit seemed
to leave me.

49:30.084 --> 49:32.848
I was then taken east...

49:32.953 --> 49:35.922
in a cage.

49:36.023 --> 49:39.356
I was taken to Toronto,
then Philadelphia...

49:40.861 --> 49:42.852
and then to New York.

49:42.963 --> 49:46.694
And each time I arrived
in another city,

49:46.800 --> 49:48.768
somehow the white men
had moved...

49:48.869 --> 49:50.803
all their people there
ahead of me.

49:53.441 --> 49:57.343
Each new city contained
the same white people as the last,

49:57.445 --> 50:00.471
and I could not understand
how a whole city of people...

50:00.582 --> 50:02.482
could be moved
so quickly.

50:05.220 --> 50:08.621
Eventually, I was
taken on a ship...

50:08.723 --> 50:11.021
across the great sea...

50:11.126 --> 50:13.185
over to England,

50:13.295 --> 50:15.627
and I was paraded
before them...

50:15.730 --> 50:17.857
like a captured animal,

50:17.966 --> 50:19.866
an exhibit.

50:21.102 --> 50:25.005
And so I mimicked them,
imitating their ways,

50:25.107 --> 50:29.373
hoping that they might lose interest
in this young savage,

50:29.478 --> 50:31.844
but their interest
only grew.

50:31.948 --> 50:34.143
So they placed me into
the white man's schools.

50:36.219 --> 50:38.414
It was there
that I discovered...

50:38.521 --> 50:40.785
in a book...

50:40.890 --> 50:43.882
the words that you,
William Blake, had written.

50:46.462 --> 50:49.829
They were powerful words,
and they spoke to me.

50:52.802 --> 50:56.738
But I made careful plans,
and I eventually escaped.

50:59.443 --> 51:02.435
Once again, I crossed
the great ocean.

51:04.114 --> 51:06.105
I saw many sad things...

51:06.216 --> 51:09.845
as I made my way back
to the lands of my people.

51:09.953 --> 51:12.888
Once they realized
who I was,

51:12.990 --> 51:15.151
the stories of my adventures
angered them.

51:16.893 --> 51:18.793
They called me a liar.

51:18.895 --> 51:23.264
"Exaybachay. "
He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing.

51:24.835 --> 51:27.360
They ridiculed me.
My own people.

51:28.939 --> 51:31.738
And I was left to wander
the earth alone.

51:34.912 --> 51:36.812
I am Nobody.

51:43.254 --> 51:46.712
Ain't ya glad the sun
kind of sets? Prepares you like?

51:46.824 --> 51:50.954
I mean, what if it, like, went out sudden,
like, say, blowin' out a candle or somethin'?

51:51.062 --> 51:53.963
I mean... You know, one minute we're ridin' along,
we can see everything and each other...

51:54.065 --> 51:57.626
and, boom, the next minute is just...
you're in total darkness.

51:57.735 --> 51:59.930
That'd scare
the bejesus outta me.

52:04.543 --> 52:09.003
Once upon a time,
there were three bears in the forest.

52:09.114 --> 52:12.379
A big bear,
a medium mommy bear...

52:12.484 --> 52:15.009
and a tiny
little baby bear.

52:15.120 --> 52:19.386
One mornin', they were gonna eat
their breakfast porridge.

52:19.491 --> 52:23.450
They had a big bowl,
a medium bowl and a tiny little bowl.

52:23.562 --> 52:25.689
That porridge was too hot.

52:25.798 --> 52:28.028
Stupid white man.

52:29.668 --> 52:33.536
- So they went to take a walk.
- William Blake, you go to them.

52:33.639 --> 52:37.098
- Along came this girl. She was...
- What?

52:39.145 --> 52:41.841
Alone? Why don't we
just go around them?

52:41.948 --> 52:44.246
No!

52:44.351 --> 52:46.376
You go.

52:46.486 --> 52:48.386
It's a test.

52:50.156 --> 52:53.887
I don't know those people,
and they don't look very friendly.

52:53.993 --> 52:57.292
- What if they kill me?
- Nobody will observe.

52:57.397 --> 53:00.230
She got sleepy, and she
went into their bedroom.

53:00.333 --> 53:03.530
- There was a big bed, a medium bed and a tiny little bed.
- All right.

53:03.636 --> 53:05.763
- I'll go.
- ... their tiny bed.

53:05.872 --> 53:08.432
I'd rather not,
but I'll go.

53:08.541 --> 53:11.705
The bears got home.
Papa said,

53:11.812 --> 53:14.542
"Somebody here ate
all our porridge. "

53:16.016 --> 53:19.577
- What's the best way to get down there?
- Be quiet and go.

53:19.687 --> 53:21.587
- And he scalped her,
- All right.

53:21.689 --> 53:24.749
and he tore her head
off her body.

53:24.859 --> 53:29.319
And he took that golden hair,
and he made a sweater for baby bear.

53:29.430 --> 53:32.228
- That's terrible.
- Tonight we're reminded...

53:32.333 --> 53:35.894
of the evil emperor
Nero Augustus.

53:36.003 --> 53:39.734
He was the scourge
of all the Christians.

53:39.840 --> 53:41.933
What's a scourge?

53:42.043 --> 53:45.410
It's... It's like when
somethin' real bad happens.

53:45.514 --> 53:49.041
Like when everybody gets killed
and you can't do anything about it.

53:49.151 --> 53:51.551
Like a swarm of locusts.

53:51.653 --> 53:54.144
For the entertainment
of his guests,

53:54.256 --> 53:56.156
Nero would illuminate
his whole garden...

53:56.258 --> 54:00.194
with bodies of live Christians
covered in burning oil...

54:00.295 --> 54:04.425
strung up
on flaming crosses, crucified.

54:06.802 --> 54:09.771
And at dinner,

54:09.871 --> 54:12.032
he would have the Christians
rubbed by his guards...

54:12.140 --> 54:15.804
with aromatic herbs
and garlic...

54:15.912 --> 54:18.904
and sewn up into sacks.

54:19.015 --> 54:22.314
And then they'd throw
these sacks to the wild dogs.

54:22.418 --> 54:24.443
Well, that's terrible.

54:24.554 --> 54:27.955
- It's horrible.
- Terrible's what it is.

54:29.659 --> 54:33.151
You know, I just... I can't
drink whiskey like I used to could.

54:33.262 --> 54:35.389
My old belly
just ain't no account.

54:35.498 --> 54:37.932
I get the shits every time,
don't you know?

54:38.034 --> 54:40.161
I'm sorry, Big George.

54:40.269 --> 54:44.535
I got some food here that
even Goldilocks never tasted.

54:44.640 --> 54:47.131
I think this is gonna
fix up your old gut.

54:55.819 --> 54:59.277
These beans is shit.

54:59.389 --> 55:02.688
Why don't you shut your goddamn trap
and just eat your beans?

55:02.793 --> 55:07.560
Them, uh... There's possum
in these beans, and spices too.

55:07.664 --> 55:10.098
- I tried hard.
- Well, Sally,

55:10.200 --> 55:12.100
I don't give a pig's ass
what anybody says.

55:12.202 --> 55:14.432
I still say you make
a hell of a pot of beans.

55:14.538 --> 55:17.996
Now why don't you say us
a grace outta the Good Book, would you?

55:18.108 --> 55:20.737
Thank you, Big George.
I'd be delighted to do that.

55:27.252 --> 55:31.279
"This day will the Lord
deliver thee into mine hand;

55:31.389 --> 55:36.019
And I will smite thee, and
take thine head from thee;

55:36.127 --> 55:40.223
And I will give the carcasses of
the host of the Philistines this day...

55:40.331 --> 55:43.960
unto the fowls of the air
and the wild beasts of the earth. "

55:44.068 --> 55:45.968
Amen.

55:46.070 --> 55:50.166
- What's a Philistine?
- Well, it's just a real dirty person.

55:56.415 --> 55:59.043
Hello.

55:59.151 --> 56:02.552
I smelled beans.

56:05.090 --> 56:06.990
Who are you
travelin' with?

56:08.427 --> 56:10.759
I'm with Nobody.

56:10.863 --> 56:12.763
Where you headed?

56:15.501 --> 56:17.401
I don't know.

56:22.441 --> 56:25.069
- Do you like beans?
- I...

56:25.177 --> 56:27.203
I love beans.

56:28.782 --> 56:31.046
Have you got
any tobacco?

56:31.151 --> 56:34.120
- I'm sorry. I don't smoke.
- Would you give me some tobacco?

56:34.220 --> 56:38.554
- I would if I had some.
- I'll trade you some beans for some tobacco.

56:38.658 --> 56:41.149
I don't have any tobacco,
but I'd love some beans.

56:41.261 --> 56:43.161
Hurt.

56:43.263 --> 56:45.731
- Yes.
- Eyeglasses.

56:47.734 --> 56:50.931
- Yes.
- Pretty suit too.

56:51.037 --> 56:53.335
- I clean up real good, you know.
- Is that right?

56:53.440 --> 56:56.204
- Yeah.
- What size shoes are those?

56:56.309 --> 56:59.541
- Ten.
- They look very comfortable. Are they?

56:59.647 --> 57:02.207
Not too bad.

57:02.316 --> 57:04.807
What kinda flower
is that?

57:04.919 --> 57:08.912
Well, it's a rose...

57:09.023 --> 57:10.923
that's made out of paper.

57:11.025 --> 57:12.216
- Paper?
- Rose.

57:12.217 --> 57:13.687
Now you see there?

57:17.064 --> 57:18.964
- Look at the edge on that knife.
- Hmm.

57:19.066 --> 57:20.966
- Feel that.
- I'd rather not.

57:21.068 --> 57:22.968
Aw, go on.

57:24.672 --> 57:29.006
That...
That is a very, very sharp knife, that is.

57:29.110 --> 57:31.010
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. Yeah.

57:31.112 --> 57:33.741
What do you call it?

57:34.916 --> 57:38.010
- Pretty.
- I'm sorry?

57:38.120 --> 57:40.020
That hat.
What do you call it?

57:43.191 --> 57:45.625
I'm really not sure.

57:45.727 --> 57:48.958
Ah, your hair.
Your hair is soft.

57:49.064 --> 57:51.055
It's like a girl's.

57:51.166 --> 57:53.066
By God, it is soft.

57:54.903 --> 57:56.837
Now how do you
get it that way?

57:56.938 --> 58:01.170
See, this old stuff of mine, it just...
Well, it's just like old barn hay.

58:01.276 --> 58:03.870
- There ain't a durn thing
you can do with it.

58:03.979 --> 58:07.347
How do you... How do you get it
that way and keep it like that?

58:08.418 --> 58:11.012
Just lucky, I guess.

58:11.120 --> 58:13.350
Lucky. Yeah.

58:13.456 --> 58:15.822
Oh, yeah.

58:15.925 --> 58:17.984
Goddamn it.
You keep your hand off of it.

58:18.094 --> 58:20.289
I thought I told you
not to touch me.

58:20.396 --> 58:23.695
I don't give a good goddamn what you told me.
You keep your hands off his hair.

58:23.800 --> 58:25.734
Why? What's that to do
with you then, eh?

58:25.835 --> 58:27.928
That's got plenty to do
with me, goddamn it.

58:28.037 --> 58:30.130
- Really? This one's mine!
- That's right.

58:30.239 --> 58:32.639
- This one's yours?
- Yes!

58:32.742 --> 58:35.836
This one's mine, Big George.
You had the last one.

58:35.945 --> 58:38.506
- Is that a fact?
- I saw him first.

58:38.615 --> 58:42.278
I don't give a shit who saw what
and who did what or who did who.

58:42.386 --> 58:45.583
You had the last Philistine.
This one's mine.

58:45.689 --> 58:47.953
If I want this one,
I'll have him, too, by God.

58:48.058 --> 58:52.154
Fine. What happens
if I just shoot you then, eh?

58:52.262 --> 58:54.856
- What do you think about that?
- You gonna shoot me?

58:54.965 --> 58:57.695
- That's right.
- Well, why don't you shoot me then, goddamn it?

58:57.801 --> 59:00.292
- I will. I'll shoot you right now.
- Come on. Shoot me.

59:00.404 --> 59:03.464
- I will.
- Well, quit talkin' about it and do it, by God.

59:03.574 --> 59:05.565
I will.

59:07.711 --> 59:11.944
- There you go.
- Good God, I'm hit! Lord have mercy!

59:12.050 --> 59:14.917
Burns like hell fire!
You son of a bitch.

59:15.019 --> 59:17.214
I'm gonna have
to kill somebody now.

59:23.728 --> 59:27.129
Well, goddamn it,
I guess nobody gets you.

59:29.400 --> 59:31.197
What the hell?
- Nobody.

59:35.340 --> 59:39.572
Oh, Jesus' bears and squirrels.

59:47.186 --> 59:49.552
I cooked, I cleaned, and I sewed,

59:49.655 --> 59:53.147
and I have
a right to get...

59:56.061 --> 59:59.189
Yee!

01:00:06.972 --> 01:00:08.872
Hootka.

01:01:01.095 --> 01:01:02.995
That's me.

01:01:17.345 --> 01:01:19.540
Wanted.

01:01:21.449 --> 01:01:25.511
"The brutal murders of one Thel Russell
and one Charles Ludlow Dickinson. "

01:01:29.925 --> 01:01:31.893
I didn't kill Thel.

01:01:38.367 --> 01:01:40.267
I didn't kill Thel.

01:01:46.108 --> 01:01:48.008
Your actions
are useless.

01:01:49.978 --> 01:01:52.811
This is complete fabrication.
There can't be...

01:02:00.323 --> 01:02:02.951
You cannot stop the clouds
by the building of a ship.

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:10.090
What? What did you say?

01:02:12.869 --> 01:02:15.497
You know, I've had it up to here
with this Indian malarkey.

01:02:15.605 --> 01:02:20.565
I haven't understood a single word you've said since
I met you, not one single word.

01:02:21.811 --> 01:02:24.507
Are you sure
you have no tobacco?

01:02:24.614 --> 01:02:27.310
I've already told you
I don't smoke.

01:02:27.417 --> 01:02:31.821
If I don't smoke, there's a pretty good
chance that I don't have any tobacco.

01:02:35.726 --> 01:02:37.956
William Blake.

01:03:18.603 --> 01:03:22.664
I guess the best advice
just not to take any damn advice.

01:03:22.774 --> 01:03:24.674
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:26.978 --> 01:03:29.037
What the hell...

01:03:29.147 --> 01:03:31.081
is that?

01:03:43.896 --> 01:03:45.989
What's that say?

01:03:46.098 --> 01:03:47.998
Read it.

01:03:50.169 --> 01:03:53.570
- "Wanted: William Blake. "
- Huh?

01:03:53.672 --> 01:03:56.698
"In the amount of $500."

01:03:58.377 --> 01:04:00.277
Shit.

01:04:02.515 --> 01:04:06.451
Hell, ain't we about more fucked
than a whore at closin' time, huh?

01:04:06.552 --> 01:04:10.114
Thanks to goddamn
Mr. Dickinson, huh?

01:04:10.223 --> 01:04:12.714
I'll tell you what
that there says, huh?

01:04:12.826 --> 01:04:16.318
It says some
pelt-wearin' trapper,

01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:21.629
some stinkin' bean-suckin' possum skinner,
he's gonna collect that reward money.

01:04:22.836 --> 01:04:25.771
Make you feel good?
Huh?

01:04:25.872 --> 01:04:28.397
- Goddamn pelt skinner.
- I'll be damn.

01:04:28.508 --> 01:04:31.602
Five hundred dollars.
I don't understand.

01:04:31.711 --> 01:04:36.307
I thought we was hired exclusive.
I mean, he paid us in gold in advance.

01:04:36.416 --> 01:04:39.749
I'm out here... I'm out here
in the middle of shits creek...

01:04:39.854 --> 01:04:41.754
with two local lunatics.

01:04:41.856 --> 01:04:43.915
One who don't
say nothin'...

01:04:44.025 --> 01:04:47.392
And the other one,
he won't never stop yappin'!

01:04:47.495 --> 01:04:51.659
You gonna shed tears for us?

01:05:08.149 --> 01:05:10.413
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

01:05:15.591 --> 01:05:19.527
- And why not?
- Because it ain't good for your health.

01:05:21.864 --> 01:05:23.764
Fuck you.

01:05:24.867 --> 01:05:27.631
Fuck me?

01:05:27.736 --> 01:05:29.636
Fuck you.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.421
Goddamn it.

01:05:47.657 --> 01:05:49.557
Jesus, Cole.

01:05:51.427 --> 01:05:53.827
He's just a kid.

01:05:55.064 --> 01:05:57.532
He's a Navajo mud toy now.

01:05:59.169 --> 01:06:01.069
Yeah.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.780
Aho.

01:07:29.862 --> 01:07:33.161
I have just ingested...

01:07:33.266 --> 01:07:35.166
the food of the Great Spirit...

01:07:36.435 --> 01:07:38.335
and Father Peyote.

01:07:39.705 --> 01:07:42.003
Do you think I could have
a little bite of it?

01:07:45.611 --> 01:07:48.546
It's not for use
even for William Blake.

01:07:49.749 --> 01:07:52.877
Flowers of the medicine...

01:07:52.985 --> 01:07:56.443
give you sacred visions
that are not for you right now.

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:03.354
My southern brothers were
prohibited from using it...

01:08:04.631 --> 01:08:06.531
by the Spanish devils.

01:08:07.768 --> 01:08:09.759
But now,

01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:13.840
even the Notoemne
and the Dene...

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:18.174
know of its loving ways.

01:09:29.518 --> 01:09:31.577
What?

01:09:31.687 --> 01:09:33.917
What are you lookin' at?

01:10:18.569 --> 01:10:21.037
William Blake.

01:10:23.307 --> 01:10:26.743
It's so strange that
you don't remember any of your poetry.

01:10:30.681 --> 01:10:33.241
I don't know anything about poetry.

01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:35.250
Oh, you're so modest.

01:10:44.396 --> 01:10:46.296
Listen...

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.300
I feel very weak.

01:10:53.171 --> 01:10:55.605
I'm hungry.

01:10:57.275 --> 01:11:01.439
Quest for vision is a great blessing,
William Blake.

01:11:01.546 --> 01:11:05.380
To do so, one must go
without food and water.

01:11:07.319 --> 01:11:10.117
All the sacred spirits...

01:11:10.222 --> 01:11:12.122
recognize
those who fast.

01:11:13.992 --> 01:11:16.928
It's good to prepare
for a journey in this way.

01:11:27.173 --> 01:11:30.472
I seem to have
misplaced my eyeglasses.

01:11:34.146 --> 01:11:36.080
I can't see clearly.

01:11:42.955 --> 01:11:46.083
Perhaps you will see
more clearly without them.

01:11:48.128 --> 01:11:50.028
You're a very strange man.

01:11:54.801 --> 01:11:57.167
Very strange.

01:12:36.144 --> 01:12:38.704
May the Great Spirit
watch over you, William Blake.

01:13:09.979 --> 01:13:11.879
Nobody?

01:13:24.259 --> 01:13:26.160
Nobody?

01:13:31.601 --> 01:13:34.195
Nobody?

01:13:39.509 --> 01:13:41.409
Nobody?

01:14:42.474 --> 01:14:45.466
- Hey, Marvin.
- What?

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.449
How come Dickinson's telegram didn't
give no description of the horse...

01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:53.518
this murderin'
fucker stole?

01:14:53.618 --> 01:14:57.247
It did, Lee. A pinto,
just like that one.

01:15:02.327 --> 01:15:06.560
White legs, brown ass,
brown sides.

01:15:06.666 --> 01:15:09.464
It did? I don't think
it did, Marvin.

01:15:09.569 --> 01:15:14.199
Well, you asshole... You got the damn
telegram on you. Take it out and look.

01:15:14.307 --> 01:15:16.969
That's right. Yeah, I got it here.
I'll check it.

01:15:18.644 --> 01:15:21.511
Maybe I been thinkin'
of them wanted posters.

01:15:31.924 --> 01:15:34.222
Lee! It's him!

01:15:38.866 --> 01:15:41.562
You William Blake?

01:15:41.668 --> 01:15:43.659
Yes, I am.

01:15:45.272 --> 01:15:47.604
Do you know my poetry?

01:16:33.822 --> 01:16:38.225
Some are born
to endless night.

01:16:57.213 --> 01:16:59.477
Well, Rome weren't built
in a day, Cole.

01:16:59.582 --> 01:17:02.881
Course, uh, I wasn't
overseein' that particular job.

01:17:36.119 --> 01:17:38.781
Fresh kill.

01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:44.087
Yeah. No damn tobacco,
that's for sure.

01:17:45.829 --> 01:17:49.857
This, uh, some kind
of telegram or somethin'?

01:17:49.967 --> 01:17:51.867
What's that say?

01:17:53.504 --> 01:17:55.699
Dickinson again.

01:17:55.806 --> 01:18:01.301
Oh, goddamn Dickinson. You mean to tell me he's even
got the law involved in this now?

01:18:01.412 --> 01:18:03.312
Jesus.

01:18:05.483 --> 01:18:09.977
Tell you one thing. FL, uh, that there
Blake fella keeps on shootin' marshals,

01:18:11.422 --> 01:18:14.084
I'll wind up
likin' the bastard.

01:18:21.565 --> 01:18:24.467
Looks like a goddamn
religious icon.

01:18:52.331 --> 01:18:54.629
Anyhow, greenback
to the beginning of the story,

01:18:54.733 --> 01:18:56.998
my granddaddy come over
from Scotland, you see.

01:18:57.103 --> 01:18:59.537
He was actually part of
the Mactwill clan.

01:18:59.639 --> 01:19:05.009
Uh, the, uh, clan tartan was kind of gold and purple,
if I remember correctly.

01:19:05.111 --> 01:19:07.443
I never wore
a lick of it myself.

01:19:07.547 --> 01:19:10.209
Dropped the "Mac" part of the name
when he decided to come out West...

01:19:10.316 --> 01:19:13.149
on account of he figured
it'd get him more work and all.

01:19:13.252 --> 01:19:16.813
How 'bout your family history
there, Cole? Let me guess.

01:19:16.923 --> 01:19:20.484
Kind of figured you for a German, huh?
I mean, am I right?

01:19:20.593 --> 01:19:22.686
Am I close?

01:19:22.795 --> 01:19:25.195
Austrian?

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:21.045
I'd like to speak with
Mr. Dickinson, please.

01:20:24.325 --> 01:20:28.022
- I insist on speaking
with Mr. Dickinson.

01:23:11.798 --> 01:23:14.130
Goddamn redskins.

01:26:50.523 --> 01:26:53.219
Oh!

01:27:04.237 --> 01:27:07.138
- Nobody?
- William Blake.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:29.323
She's upset.

01:28:08.403 --> 01:28:11.429
She's beautiful.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:21.639
- She didn't mean to call you that.
- Huh?

01:28:21.751 --> 01:28:24.845
But you sure interrupted
a very romantic moment, William Blake.

01:28:24.954 --> 01:28:26.854
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:28:26.956 --> 01:28:30.016
You stay here 'til I return.

01:28:46.375 --> 01:28:49.504
Don't let the sun burn
a hole in your ass, William Blake.

01:28:49.613 --> 01:28:52.912
Rise now and drive
your cart and plow...

01:28:53.016 --> 01:28:54.950
over the bones
of the dead.

01:28:57.387 --> 01:28:59.287
Do you still have
my eyeglasses?

01:28:59.389 --> 01:29:02.324
No. I traded 'em.

01:29:02.426 --> 01:29:06.692
- You traded them?
- Do you have any tobacco?

01:29:07.864 --> 01:29:10.856
No. I traded it.

01:29:10.968 --> 01:29:15.064
- For what?
- I'm not telling.

01:29:16.506 --> 01:29:19.839
- Liar.
- Thief.

01:30:28.915 --> 01:30:33.477
I don't care if you were
married 16 times

01:30:35.155 --> 01:30:37.953
I still love you

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:40.618
Yo-ho yo-ho-yo

01:30:47.701 --> 01:30:51.398
I will take you to
the bridge made of waters.

01:30:51.504 --> 01:30:54.667
The mirror.

01:30:54.774 --> 01:30:57.709
Then you will be taken up
to the next level of the world.

01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:02.378
The place where
William Blake is from.

01:31:02.483 --> 01:31:04.474
Where his spirit belongs.

01:31:06.187 --> 01:31:10.283
I must make sure that you pass back
through the mirror at the place...

01:31:10.391 --> 01:31:12.291
where the sea
meets the sky.

01:31:55.871 --> 01:31:57.702
White man's
trading post.

01:31:59.875 --> 01:32:01.809
Indians get
diseases there.

01:32:03.111 --> 01:32:05.012
What do you mean?

01:32:05.114 --> 01:32:07.412
Smallpox,
consumption.

01:32:09.585 --> 01:32:11.485
Blankets are infected.

01:32:12.755 --> 01:32:14.723
It spreads
through the villages.

01:32:18.728 --> 01:32:20.719
I see you have acquired
a new weapon.

01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:23.924
Hmm? Oh, yes.
A Winchester.

01:32:25.334 --> 01:32:28.303
- Here. Take it.
- No.

01:32:28.404 --> 01:32:30.736
No, really.
Take it.

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:32.865
I took it off
a dead white man.

01:32:32.975 --> 01:32:36.103
Did William Blake
kill this white man?

01:32:38.949 --> 01:32:40.849
Yes.

01:32:42.219 --> 01:32:44.153
William Blake killed
the white man.

01:32:58.535 --> 01:33:00.560
We need a canoe.

01:33:40.078 --> 01:33:41.978
Water.

01:34:18.718 --> 01:34:22.313
"The brutal murders of Charles Dickinson
and fiancée, Thel Russell.

01:34:24.090 --> 01:34:26.615
Also the murders of
the following territorial marshals...

01:34:26.726 --> 01:34:31.754
...deputy... Big George Drakoulious,

01:34:31.865 --> 01:34:37.269
Benmont Tench
and one Salvatore Sally Jenko. "

01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:41.470
- It's not bad.
- Huh?

01:34:41.574 --> 01:34:44.236
It's not a bad illustration
of you, William Blake.

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:54.448
Well, I want you
to have it.

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:57.251
- It's a present.
- Aho.

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:18.603
Good morning.
May you serve the Lord,

01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:21.443
and may His holy dominion
guide you through your dismal life.

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:24.348
How can I be of assistance,
my poor man?

01:35:24.453 --> 01:35:26.353
All our ammunition
is guaranteed.

01:35:26.455 --> 01:35:30.482
This latest batch was, in fact,
personally blessed by the archbishop of Detroit.

01:35:39.201 --> 01:35:41.863
Good morning.

01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:46.202
May our Lord Jesus Christ
wash this earth with His holy light...

01:35:46.308 --> 01:35:51.974
and purge its darkest places
from heathens and philistines.

01:35:53.315 --> 01:35:57.116
The vision of Christ
that thou dost see...

01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:00.053
is my vision's
greatest enemy.

01:36:10.767 --> 01:36:12.667
Do you have tobacco?

01:36:13.770 --> 01:36:16.261
We sure don't.

01:36:16.372 --> 01:36:19.739
Aren't those tins of tobacco
right there behind you?

01:36:19.842 --> 01:36:23.005
Sure are, but
those cans are empty.

01:36:24.447 --> 01:36:27.576
There's no tobacco in them.

01:36:27.684 --> 01:36:30.983
Perhaps I could interest you
in some beads...

01:36:32.689 --> 01:36:34.589
or possibly a blanket.

01:36:37.294 --> 01:36:39.194
Blanket.

01:36:41.899 --> 01:36:43.833
Yes, my fine fellow.
Ammunition.

01:36:45.402 --> 01:36:48.269
Uh, I'd like some
tobacco, please.

01:36:51.308 --> 01:36:55.938
Well, I may have
one or two twists left.

01:36:57.681 --> 01:37:00.149
From my personal supply,
you understand.

01:37:03.254 --> 01:37:05.381
For good friends only.

01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:14.021
Good Lord.

01:37:16.067 --> 01:37:17.967
You're William Blake.

01:37:21.206 --> 01:37:23.504
Yes, I am.

01:37:23.608 --> 01:37:26.543
By the grace
of the Lord Almighty.

01:37:26.644 --> 01:37:30.273
Sir, would it be presumptuous
of me to ask you for...

01:37:33.786 --> 01:37:35.686
for your autograph?

01:37:39.925 --> 01:37:43.759
Please, kind sir.
It would be a great honor.

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.300
Pardon me.

01:37:58.310 --> 01:38:00.676
There's
my autograph.

01:38:03.849 --> 01:38:07.251
God damn your soul
to the fires of hell.

01:38:11.491 --> 01:38:13.686
He already has.

01:38:35.482 --> 01:38:37.382
Hootka.

01:38:40.821 --> 01:38:43.381
I'm tired.

01:38:48.663 --> 01:38:50.563
I'll free the horses.

01:39:48.992 --> 01:39:52.325
I see you collected
some more white man's metal.

01:39:52.428 --> 01:39:55.886
Yes. I seem to be
a magnet for it.

01:39:57.567 --> 01:39:59.660
Ohh, man.

01:40:03.206 --> 01:40:05.197
Good day for
a canoe ride.

01:41:44.110 --> 01:41:46.806
Nobody?

01:41:49.315 --> 01:41:52.682
Is this the boat...

01:41:52.785 --> 01:41:54.980
that'll take me across
the mirror of water?

01:41:56.355 --> 01:41:59.257
No.

01:41:59.359 --> 01:42:01.418
This boat's not strong enough,
William Blake.

01:42:18.111 --> 01:42:23.811
William Blake
is a legend now

01:42:23.917 --> 01:42:26.442
He's a good friend
of mine

01:45:46.025 --> 01:45:47.994
Stand up,
William Blake.

01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:55.400
William Blake.

01:45:57.237 --> 01:45:59.262
Ah.

01:46:29.904 --> 01:46:31.838
Walk proudly,
William Blake.

01:48:35.534 --> 01:48:38.765
That man there?
I know him.

01:48:41.706 --> 01:48:44.698
He's a great builder
of sea canoes.

01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:27.332
Hello.

01:53:31.872 --> 01:53:34.739
I prepared your canoe
with cedar boughs.

01:53:37.144 --> 01:53:41.137
It's time for you
to leave now, William Blake.

01:53:41.248 --> 01:53:44.445
Time for you to go back
to where you came from.

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:50.756
You mean Cleveland?

01:53:50.858 --> 01:53:53.952
Back to the place where
all the spirits came from...

01:53:55.229 --> 01:53:57.697
and where all
the spirits return.

01:54:01.336 --> 01:54:03.736
This world will
no longer concern you.

01:54:15.650 --> 01:54:17.641
Found some tobacco.

01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:23.122
The tobacco
is for your voyage,

01:54:23.224 --> 01:54:25.385
William Blake.

01:54:36.872 --> 01:54:38.772
Nobody.

01:54:39.909 --> 01:54:41.809
I don't smoke.

01:55:05.769 --> 01:55:07.737
Aho, William Blake.
