00:00.400 --> 00:04.400
Ziane never submitted any evidence
during the investigation.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.240
I found something. We're finished.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.230
All I need you to do
is to confirm some facts for me.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.230
These are facts
that will help me prove

00:17.280 --> 00:19.470
what happened to Oliver Hughes.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.110
I'll tell you what I know.

00:21.160 --> 00:24.240
What good can come from sending
you to prison?

00:29.880 --> 00:32.360
If you tell anybody
about Charmataines...

~ Alex?! ~ Alex?

01:47.560 --> 01:48.760
~ Alex! ~ Alex?

MUSIC: Come Home
by Amatorski

02:22.480 --> 02:25.590
* Oh, my love

02:25.640 --> 02:29.150
* We pray each day

02:29.200 --> 02:32.990
* May you come home

02:33.040 --> 02:36.840
* And be OK

02:43.560 --> 02:46.670
* For now we wait

02:46.720 --> 02:49.710
* For you, for you

02:49.760 --> 02:52.240
* To come home. *

03:38.040 --> 03:39.520
My leg?

03:40.960 --> 03:42.830
Good days and bad.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.440
It wasn't the way I hoped
my career would end.

03:46.640 --> 03:50.070
And thanks to you, the last case
I worked on remains unsolved.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.310
If you had stayed on the
Hughes investigation,

03:52.360 --> 03:54.840
you think that you
would have found the boy?

03:56.800 --> 03:58.200
We'll never know.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.030
I had no choice.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.190
You understand?

04:04.240 --> 04:06.510
I could not let you see that file...

04:06.560 --> 04:09.360
And yet I did,
Monsieur Charmataines. I saw it.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.750
After everything
I have done for that journalist.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.910
Everything I gave him...

04:15.960 --> 04:17.670
he still turned me in.

04:17.720 --> 04:18.910
Look, I didn't come here

04:18.959 --> 04:21.190
to talk about the past,
Monsieur Charmataines.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.030
Then why do you keep calling me
by that name?

04:23.080 --> 04:26.590
You were seen at the pool
where Oliver was taken.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.430
You took something,
placed it in an evidence bag.

04:29.480 --> 04:33.910
And yet you never submitted
anything into evidence. How come?

04:33.960 --> 04:35.360
I don't remember.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.280
We have a witness.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.670
Are you listening to me?

04:41.720 --> 04:43.830
Someone saw you.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.320
What did you take?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.560
What did you take?

04:50.280 --> 04:53.920
It takes nothing to tell us
and it means everything to us.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.240
Everything.

04:59.640 --> 05:00.680
OK.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.070
But you must bring my son to see me.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.470
Excuse me?

05:05.520 --> 05:08.190
You bring my son to me and I will
tell you what you wish to know.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.910
You want to see your son?

05:09.960 --> 05:11.350
Your son?

05:11.400 --> 05:14.230
Listen, if you concealed any
evidence

05:14.280 --> 05:15.870
that stopped us finding Olly...

05:15.920 --> 05:19.190
Look, I cannot compel him to visit
if he doesn't wish to.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.150
Then I suggest that you try.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.990
Because that will be the only way
that I will talk to you.

05:24.040 --> 05:27.160
My son Anouar is studying
at UPEC, Paris-Creteil.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.470
Hello?

05:46.520 --> 05:48.790
'Mr Hughes, it's Malik Suri.
Don't hang up.'

05:48.840 --> 05:50.310
Why?

05:50.360 --> 05:52.680
Because I know what
happened to your son.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.990
'I have Vincent Bourg on record.
He's saying that you attacked him.'

05:58.040 --> 05:59.950
Tony?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.590
'That you broke into his flat.'

06:02.640 --> 06:06.510
And he told you Ian Garrett
paid for his alibi.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.470
Your assaults on Greg Halpern
and Vincent Bourg

06:09.520 --> 06:11.440
establish a pattern of violence.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.470
'And your knowledge
that Garrett was a paedophile,

06:16.520 --> 06:18.390
'well, that establishes motive...'

06:18.440 --> 06:20.150
What are you trying to say?

06:20.200 --> 06:22.150
What do you know about
my son's disappearance?

06:22.200 --> 06:25.750
'I believe Ian Garrett
killed your son.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.190
'Why else would
he pay for Bourg's alibi?'

06:28.240 --> 06:29.880
The police cleared Garrett.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.950
'But you didn't know that
when you killed him,

06:33.000 --> 06:34.320
'did you, Mr Hughes?'

06:37.080 --> 06:38.990
With Mr Bourg's statement,

06:39.040 --> 06:41.270
legally, I can make
the clear implication.

06:41.320 --> 06:45.350
The police will do the rest.
They'd open up an investigation.

06:45.400 --> 06:48.030
'Any parent in your position...

06:48.080 --> 06:52.520
'People will understand, but only if
you tell your side of the story.'

07:03.360 --> 07:06.070
I still can't believe
they actually post bees.

07:06.120 --> 07:10.240
Yeah, the queen must be placed in a
separate cage to the other bees.

07:12.840 --> 07:17.630
The only thing dividing them
is a wall, like a plug of sugar,

07:17.680 --> 07:21.670
which the other bees
will eat away at...

07:21.720 --> 07:23.200
until the queen is free.

07:24.360 --> 07:30.910
It is a way of getting them
accustomed to her scent,

07:30.960 --> 07:35.400
so... they accept her
as their queen.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.150
Just the way we met, yes?

07:42.560 --> 07:45.070
Why couldn't you have just taken
up bird-watching?

07:45.120 --> 07:50.480
Well, you might as well count blades
of grass on the ground.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.870
This... this will give us honey.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.270
Since when have you ever
eaten honey?

07:59.240 --> 08:01.670
Come on, come and sit down
and have something to eat.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.310
C'est un ordre.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.680
Have you seen this?

08:15.000 --> 08:18.510
Yes. I saw it when the story
first broke.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.310
You don't think it's got
anything to do

08:20.360 --> 08:21.910
with the Oliver Hughes case,
do you?

08:21.960 --> 08:24.160
I don't know.
Maybe, I don't know.

08:27.320 --> 08:31.030
Have you called Laurence
to find out more?

08:31.080 --> 08:32.950
Of course not.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.950
I am not interested any more.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.360
You wanted me to let go.

08:39.360 --> 08:43.710
That man Ziane hurt you.
All those surgeries...

08:43.760 --> 08:46.840
We thought you were going to
lose your leg altogether.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.070
He could've killed you, Julien.

08:52.120 --> 08:56.030
And call me selfish, but no case -
not Oliver Hughes or Ian Garrett -

08:56.080 --> 08:59.110
nothing is more important
than having you here

08:59.160 --> 09:00.920
safe and well with me.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.750
Come on, amour.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.190
I still have one good leg.

09:08.240 --> 09:12.560
I assure you, I don't miss it.
Not at all.

09:14.360 --> 09:15.710
Huh?

09:15.760 --> 09:17.230
OK.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.480
Tony!

10:07.480 --> 10:08.520
Tony.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.590
Someone's at the door.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.190
Huh?

10:17.240 --> 10:18.360
Could you get it?

10:25.640 --> 10:27.950
Could you get it, please?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.480
Yeah.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.670
Did you talk to Peter?

10:33.720 --> 10:36.520
~ No. ~ If you keep not showing up,
they'll have to let you go.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.200
I thought you were coming tonight.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.160
Look.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.110
Oh, my God!

10:56.160 --> 10:58.120
What? What is it?

11:07.920 --> 11:09.520
It'll be all right.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.240
You don't know that.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.950
How do we decide?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.200
Mrs Price?

11:40.480 --> 11:41.760
What?

11:43.280 --> 11:44.950
It can't be a coincidence.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.590
The sports ground's only two miles
away from the swimming pool

11:47.640 --> 11:49.350
and he was taken fast,
just like Olly.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.750
~ We don't know that for sure.
~ They're connected. They have to be.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.880
We should be there.
I'll see what time there's a train.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.190
Listen, are you sure
this is a good idea?

12:03.240 --> 12:06.080
What? If they're connected and
they find any leads on this boy...

12:07.840 --> 12:10.360
Oh, yeah.
Maybe you shouldn't come, Em.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.910
No. No, I'll be fine.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.430
Look, we can do this on our own.
No-one's going to judge you.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.190
No, I want to come.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.440
Right, I'll book
the three o'clock.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.710
You all right? You OK?

13:37.760 --> 13:39.920
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.510
Laurence.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.750
Thanks for seeing us.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.510
So, what's happening?
What do you know?

14:02.560 --> 14:05.350
Please, Mr and Mrs Hughes,
I understand you are anxious,

14:05.400 --> 14:07.510
we all are,
but you shouldn't have come.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.630
~ We have every right to be here...
~ We want to help.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.630
I have no time to brief you now.
Perhaps if you call Baptiste...

14:12.680 --> 14:13.870
Baptiste is here?

14:13.920 --> 14:16.590
He called as soon as the news broke,
offering his advice.

14:16.640 --> 14:17.910
He knows what I know.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.790
And when I have time, I promise...

14:20.840 --> 14:23.230
~ Excuse me?
~ .. I will call you when I can.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.960
I'm sorry.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.360
I'm just so sorry.

15:18.520 --> 15:21.030
~ Good to see you.
~ You too.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.950
Sylvie.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.360
Emily.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.880
Hello.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.710
Thanks for fitting us in.

15:37.760 --> 15:41.320
Nonsense. The moment I heard
the news, I thought about your boy.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.840
He was always in my prayers.

15:48.720 --> 15:51.790
He still doesn't have the
smoking ban through his thick head.

15:52.960 --> 15:56.270
And this is what comes
from such a habit.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.760
~ So, room number six.
~ Thank you. ~ Please.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.950
You will always have a home here.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.200
Thanks, Sylvie.

16:33.680 --> 16:36.320
TV works in this room at least.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.200
Tony, I think I've made a mistake.

16:42.480 --> 16:45.350
I thought I'd be OK, I thought...

16:45.400 --> 16:47.360
I'm coping a lot better now,
but I just...

16:48.680 --> 16:51.990
This room, it's just the same.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.030
Sylvie's been so nice to us,
you know, so good.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.790
I mean, Christ knows the amount
of business we must've cost them

16:57.840 --> 16:59.430
over the last few years,
her and Alain.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.880
It's the least we can do.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.030
Doesn't it get to you?

17:18.079 --> 17:20.150
Of course it does.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.200
Why are we here?
We need to go.

17:28.319 --> 17:30.390
I want to stay somewhere else.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.270
Why? So we can forget?

17:33.320 --> 17:36.550
No. No, I didn't mean it like that.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.760
I just... I think...

17:40.240 --> 17:42.870
I think this is punishing ourselves.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.470
Well, you run away if you want.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.630
That's all you've done ever
since he disappeared -

17:46.680 --> 17:48.640
run away and pretend
like it never happened.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.430
How much did you drink on the train?

18:02.480 --> 18:05.520
I'm surprised you even noticed,
the amount of medication you're on.

18:07.480 --> 18:08.960
I'll be at the Marquis.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.390
Why don't we just go in
and ask to see him?

18:28.440 --> 18:31.600
We are here to ask for his help.
Not to embarrass him.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.670
Is everything all right?

18:49.720 --> 18:51.990
Oh, yeah, it's just the bank, again.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.040
I'm not their favourite customer.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.750
~ Hello. Do you speak English? ~ Yeah.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.590
We're here about your father.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.830
Khalid Ziane. Khalid Charmataines.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.790
I have nothing to
say about my father.

19:18.840 --> 19:19.880
Anouar!

19:21.520 --> 19:23.950
Anouar, your father...
Your father knows something.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.750
Something that could help us
find our son.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.150
But he won't tell us,
not unless you agree to meet him.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.590
~ You must know what my father did.
~ Yes, we understand that.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.950
No, you don't. You can't.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.990
I had no idea who he was.
I had no idea what he had done.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.430
When your son was taken,
all of that changed.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.790
Because of this -

19:39.840 --> 19:42.510
I found out that he caught my mother
in bed with another man.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.910
That he beat her and she ended up
dead of those injuries...

19:45.960 --> 19:47.870
so I would never know her.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.590
Then he just left me.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.710
He left me on my own, he ran away,

19:51.760 --> 19:54.280
changed his name
and had a new family.

19:58.920 --> 20:01.990
That man has no right to call
himself your father.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.790
You don't have to feel sorry for
him. You don't have to speak to him.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.710
But trust me, I'm telling you,
if you don't look him in the eye,

20:07.760 --> 20:10.350
you'll regret it
until your dying day.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.750
I do understand.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.390
Every son needs to know
who their father is.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.590
Even if he is a monster?

20:17.640 --> 20:20.280
I'm begging you Anouar, please.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.600
Anouar.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.840
Anouar.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.350
'Hello?'

20:58.400 --> 21:00.200
Mark. This is Julien Baptiste.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.670
'I hope I am not disturbing...'

21:02.720 --> 21:04.710
Hey. No, not at all, not at all.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.310
'How did it go with Ziane's son?'

21:07.360 --> 21:08.430
Not as we would hope.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.630
We have returned to
Chalons du Bois without him.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.790
'I'm sorry to hear that.'

21:11.840 --> 21:13.630
We will try another approach
with Ziane.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.030
In the meantime,
I was hoping for your help.

21:16.080 --> 21:17.190
'Anything.'

21:17.240 --> 21:19.550
Ziane was leaking information to
that journalist...

21:19.600 --> 21:21.030
Malik.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.830
'There's a chance that Malik
knew

21:22.880 --> 21:24.750
'about the evidence Ziane found.'

21:24.800 --> 21:26.070
'I'll get right on it.'

21:26.120 --> 21:27.360
Thank you, my friend.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.640
~ Monsieur Baptiste. ~ Merci.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.400
Ah, Baptiste.

23:21.320 --> 23:22.630
Go home...

23:22.680 --> 23:24.230
I'm OK, I can work...

23:24.280 --> 23:27.320
Just go home. You've been
looking like shit for days.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.720
Sort it out.

23:51.240 --> 23:54.350
Don't worry. We'll find a way to
get through to Ziane.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.630
How can you be so relaxed?

23:55.680 --> 23:57.830
I'm not relaxed.

23:57.880 --> 24:00.550
I'm just getting used to it.

24:00.600 --> 24:04.030
You've clearly been spending
a lot of time with Julien.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.520
It's good for you.

24:13.360 --> 24:17.070
Before I came out here,
Mark and I called off the wedding.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.480
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

24:22.440 --> 24:26.240
Sometimes I wonder if I was just
lying to myself anyway.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.390
Like having this new family
was just a plaster

24:31.440 --> 24:34.320
to cover up the pain,
to stop the bleeding.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.480
Maybe I don't want to cover
it up any more.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.520
So what about you?

24:50.280 --> 24:51.990
What do you mean?

24:52.040 --> 24:54.240
I mean, what is going on with you?

24:58.320 --> 25:00.440
Just getting what's coming to me.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.560
What do you mean?

25:07.760 --> 25:09.480
Malik Suri.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.470
He knows...

25:12.520 --> 25:15.800
about Ian Garrett,
he knows what I did.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.040
How?

25:24.560 --> 25:26.080
I've no idea.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.280
But he says he's got enough
to go to press.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.800
Maybe it's what I deserve.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.750
Don't say that.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.400
You shouldn't say that.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.360
It was an accident.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.480
Wasn't it?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.360
I killed him.

26:09.800 --> 26:10.840
I'm sorry.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.200
(I'm sorry.)

26:24.120 --> 26:25.440
Are you all right?

26:31.880 --> 26:33.680
(I'm sorry.)

26:48.680 --> 26:50.760
This bloody place.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.960
Tell me about it.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.400
I'm a bit drunk.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.110
Let's get you back to your hotel.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.480
Oh, no, let's just wait here
a moment.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.990
This place...

27:16.040 --> 27:17.640
it's actually beautiful.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.710
I've spent so long resenting
this town,

27:24.760 --> 27:26.680
I forgot to ever really look at it.

27:36.840 --> 27:40.080
It's like the world conspired
against us.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.750
That night when...

27:51.800 --> 27:53.200
when we lost Olly...

27:56.040 --> 27:57.480
.. I didn't just lose him.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.680
I lost you too.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.640
I thought we could survive anything,
us two.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.670
I thought, if anything, something
that horrific

28:10.720 --> 28:12.640
would make us stronger.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.190
I pushed you away.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.550
It was my fault.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.000
I was the one...

28:52.000 --> 28:53.310
Hey.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.710
Hey.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.840
~ Do you mind if I join you?
~ No, come on.

29:01.720 --> 29:04.670
I thought you were at the Eden.

29:04.720 --> 29:05.800
Tony is.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.710
How's James?

29:15.760 --> 29:17.430
He's good.

29:17.480 --> 29:19.910
He's with his mum this weekend.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.310
Always mentions you every
time I see him.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.600
Well, actually, he talks about
"the pretty lady with the presents".

29:28.720 --> 29:30.240
How was his swimming race?

29:35.240 --> 29:38.070
He did really well.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.480
He came second.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.640
Aw, he looks so pleased.

29:52.720 --> 29:56.870
Listen, tell me to mind my own
business...

29:56.920 --> 29:58.320
are you and Tony OK?

30:01.040 --> 30:03.710
Well, you see us pretty regularly.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.160
What do you think?

30:06.560 --> 30:09.670
~ I shouldn't pry...
~ No, I was serious.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.110
You're a detective.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.840
What do you see,
when you look at me and Tony?

30:18.440 --> 30:21.950
I see two people who have been
through something dreadful.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.470
I see an alky and a basket case.

30:24.520 --> 30:26.190
Hey, come on, that's not fair.

30:26.240 --> 30:29.310
You picked yourself up after
that night on the bridge.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.710
You went back to London and you
forced yourself back into work,

30:32.760 --> 30:34.870
back into some kind of life.

30:34.920 --> 30:38.310
You've got to give yourself credit
for that, even if Tony won't.

30:38.360 --> 30:39.480
It's not his fault.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.800
He blames himself for Olly.

30:48.240 --> 30:51.200
And I told him, a long time ago,
that I blamed him too.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.910
I don't think he's ever
forgotten that.

30:54.960 --> 30:57.710
But you are trying to put
yourself back together

30:57.760 --> 31:00.360
and you can't let Tony
stand in the way of that.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.270
They're beautiful pictures.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.070
He's such a lovely boy.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.390
You're very lucky.

31:16.440 --> 31:17.990
I am lucky.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.120
I should've known
you'd follow us out here.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.550
I have a job to do.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.910
Is that what you call it?

31:38.960 --> 31:41.560
Oh, and a new mouth to feed,
I can see.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.840
Yeah, maybe.

31:58.360 --> 32:01.840
There's quite a high risk of my
child having cystic fibrosis.

32:05.960 --> 32:09.320
They want to run some tests
to make sure.

32:12.520 --> 32:16.920
But to do the test, well,
that carries a risk of miscarriage.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.080
Then if it is positive, then what?

32:31.200 --> 32:32.760
Can I see?

32:51.960 --> 32:55.190
If someone had told me
when Olly was born,

32:55.240 --> 32:59.480
you're going to lose him,
he's going to be taken from you...

33:01.520 --> 33:03.320
.. and you'll never know why...

33:06.680 --> 33:08.600
.. and you'll never see him again...

33:10.840 --> 33:12.280
.. I'd still have had him.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.440
Not that it's any of my concern.

33:20.280 --> 33:22.120
What, no questions for me?

33:25.240 --> 33:26.520
No.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.360
~ Hey. ~ Tony!

35:06.360 --> 35:08.160
Thanks for this, it means a lot.

35:10.080 --> 35:13.550
We arrested Claude Duchamps
an hour and a half ago.

35:13.600 --> 35:17.790
Just remember, please, it is against
protocol to show you in here.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.070
If Detective Walsh was not
a friend...

35:20.120 --> 35:22.920
~ We'll be discreet. I promise.
~ Follow me, please.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.600
The child was abducted
by his own father.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.710
He and the mother
had a bad divorce,

35:41.760 --> 35:44.430
so he feared he would
lose custody,

35:44.480 --> 35:47.390
so he arranged for his
brother to take the child.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.830
Somewhere public,
so he would be above suspicion.

35:50.880 --> 35:54.510
He was thinking of your son's case
when he planned it.

35:54.560 --> 35:58.870
He knew the connection would be
made in the eyes of the public.

35:58.920 --> 36:00.910
Who would do that?

36:00.960 --> 36:03.550
Who would let someone believe
that their own child was...

36:03.600 --> 36:05.110
It's more common than you'd think.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.840
Most child abductions are done
by the parents.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.750
He says, "You ask me why?

36:19.800 --> 36:23.950
"She was going to leave the
country with her new husband.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.720
"I lose the right to see my son,
my own flesh and blood.

36:30.960 --> 36:36.070
"You ask me why? It is because
I love him with all my heart

36:36.120 --> 36:41.080
"and I would do anything for him.
Anything."

37:01.240 --> 37:02.680
Tony.

37:07.280 --> 37:09.830
~ I can't believe it.
~ What?

37:09.880 --> 37:11.270
~ You're not...
~ What?

37:11.320 --> 37:12.360
Relieved?

37:14.720 --> 37:15.760
No, I am.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.910
Jesus Christ, Tony, that woman,
she thought she'd lost her son.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.310
We did lose our son.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.110
Why would you wish
that on anyone else?

37:24.160 --> 37:26.510
How can you be upset about that
poor boy being found?

37:26.560 --> 37:28.510
Because I thought we might
be on to something.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.270
Because I thought it might be
connected.

37:30.320 --> 37:34.030
And you're sad that they aren't?
That this child isn't...?

37:34.080 --> 37:35.390
What the hell is wrong with you?

37:35.440 --> 37:37.630
Don't tell me there isn't some
small part of you

37:37.680 --> 37:39.870
that wanted it to be related?

37:39.920 --> 37:42.750
So that it might tell us something.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.870
So it might point us in some kind
of direction after all these years.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.240
~ No! ~ Why? Because you've given
up on him?!

37:56.080 --> 37:58.400
Is this what our lives are now?

38:00.960 --> 38:03.590
We don't talk any more,

38:03.640 --> 38:05.190
we don't sleep together.

38:05.240 --> 38:10.030
Christ, I can't even remember
the last time I smiled.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.990
We're allowed to smile, Tony.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.350
It doesn't make us bad people.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.990
It makes us human,
because we have to at least try

38:17.040 --> 38:19.240
or we might as well just
give up on life.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.200
But you already have, haven't you?

38:28.840 --> 38:30.880
Haven't you?

38:33.920 --> 38:35.880
I think we should get a divorce.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.120
Fine.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.190
No, erm...

38:53.240 --> 38:54.590
~ Listen, I...
~ I'm sorry.

38:54.640 --> 38:55.710
No, I'm sorry.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.910
I'm sorry.

38:56.960 --> 38:57.950
No, no.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.760
~ I'm so sorry.
~ No, no.

39:01.360 --> 39:07.350
The truth is, I think Mark's
better for you than I ever was.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.590
He's been there for you.

39:09.640 --> 39:13.310
All these years, he put you before
everything else. I didn't.

39:13.360 --> 39:17.350
After Olly was taken,
I couldn't even see you any more.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.710
All I saw was him.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.150
His eyes, his smile...

39:22.200 --> 39:24.800
always reminding me it was my fault.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.560
I just want you to be happy.

39:32.080 --> 39:35.310
You deserve that.

39:35.360 --> 39:37.590
Life is short.

39:37.640 --> 39:41.310
Maybe just stop thinking about
Malik and what's going to happen

39:41.360 --> 39:43.080
if it all comes out and just...

39:46.480 --> 39:49.600
.. just grab life where you can.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.520
Just grab it.

40:05.680 --> 40:07.040
What?

40:11.200 --> 40:13.360
You've had too much to drink.

40:47.280 --> 40:48.600
Hello.

40:52.520 --> 40:53.560
Merci.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.360
How many times this morning?

41:15.720 --> 41:17.400
Twice.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.200
There is a bug going around
at work.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.040
You have been feeling nauseous
all week, though, no?

41:28.240 --> 41:31.470
I went to Oxford,
maybe the travelling...

41:31.520 --> 41:34.350
I think we'll take
a week off the treatment.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.470
No...

41:35.520 --> 41:39.110
Your body is rejecting the
chemicals. It needs time to adjust.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.430
Perhaps a smaller dose...

41:40.480 --> 41:43.590
You don't understand!

41:43.640 --> 41:45.870
It is working!

41:45.920 --> 41:48.990
On the contrary, Mr Bourg,
it's doing the opposite.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.990
It's making you sick.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.320
Without it, I will be sick.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.400
My mind will be sick.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.990
Help me.

42:00.040 --> 42:01.600
Please!

42:05.720 --> 42:07.790
Please?

42:07.840 --> 42:09.440
Please?

42:35.720 --> 42:37.110
Hi.

42:37.160 --> 42:38.790
Listen, I...

42:38.840 --> 42:40.750
I need to talk to you
about something.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.710
~ I have to something to say.
~ Yeah, hold on.

42:42.760 --> 42:43.800
Please.

42:46.880 --> 42:50.110
Malik Suri called me yesterday.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.110
He knows about Ian Garrett.

42:52.160 --> 42:53.400
About what I did.

42:56.720 --> 42:57.910
How?

42:57.960 --> 43:01.950
He didn't say. Just that he has
enough to go to print.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.590
Well, he doesn't have any proof.

43:05.640 --> 43:06.990
The only proof is...

43:07.040 --> 43:09.510
The shirt, I know.
And I destroyed it.

43:09.560 --> 43:12.350
But he doesn't need proof, Julien.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.910
He just needs to make an allegation.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.710
Then people will start
looking into it,

43:16.760 --> 43:18.950
and then you could be
dragged into the whole mess.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.630
Those construction guys at
Audresselles saw you take the shirt.

43:22.680 --> 43:24.760
What if Laurence asks them about it?

43:26.720 --> 43:28.310
I make my own decisions.

43:28.360 --> 43:30.640
I am prepared to face
the consequences.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.110
No.

43:35.160 --> 43:36.400
It's not right.

43:38.400 --> 43:39.920
I'm going to confess.

43:41.880 --> 43:44.680
If I get in front of it,
then you won't get sucked in.

43:46.920 --> 43:48.520
I need to write a statement.

43:52.520 --> 43:56.190
Well, you've made up your mind.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.830
I will not try to change it.

43:57.880 --> 44:01.110
But please allow me to help you
with your statement.

44:01.160 --> 44:03.950
We must place events in a certain
light, just so,

44:04.000 --> 44:07.160
in order that people may fully
understand what you did.

44:11.560 --> 44:12.630
OK, then.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.830
And first we will go and see
Khalid Ziane.

44:14.880 --> 44:16.950
Why? He won't see us
without his son...

44:17.000 --> 44:19.550
Then it is a good thing
Anouar will be joining us

44:19.600 --> 44:22.190
at the maison d'arret, huh?

44:22.240 --> 44:23.840
I spoke with him last night.

44:25.640 --> 44:28.910
I wanted to tell you when I came in
but, you know...

44:28.960 --> 44:30.480
your statement...

44:33.640 --> 44:35.150
You can call Emily now.

44:35.200 --> 44:36.240
Yeah.

44:37.680 --> 44:39.120
~ May I? ~ Er, yeah.

46:55.240 --> 46:57.550
Someone had him killed
because he was going to talk.

46:57.600 --> 47:00.680
Yes. The question is, who knew that
he was about to speak to us?

47:02.600 --> 47:04.710
What, so that's it?

47:04.760 --> 47:06.840
There's nothing else that we can do?

47:09.960 --> 47:12.110
There is some hope.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.270
A small hope.

47:14.320 --> 47:18.110
Someone Ziane fed information to.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.830
Deep breath, deep breath.

47:23.480 --> 47:24.990
Let's turn that off.

47:26.920 --> 47:29.110
~ Good job, we'll take it off now.
~ I'll get it.

47:29.160 --> 47:30.910
Finished now.

47:30.960 --> 47:33.630
Come on, then. High-five.

47:33.680 --> 47:36.750
Oh, missed. High-five.
Oh!

47:36.800 --> 47:39.710
High-five. Oh!

47:39.760 --> 47:41.670
Can we talk?

47:41.720 --> 47:42.960
So what's this about?

47:45.720 --> 47:50.590
Back in 2006, the man you
exposed as Khalid Charmataines

47:50.640 --> 47:53.520
was leaking you information
from the Hughes case.

47:55.600 --> 47:58.030
I believe he gave you something
that he'd found

47:58.080 --> 48:00.880
on a re-canvas of the scene.
Something that you never gave back.

48:05.480 --> 48:09.150
You've got a very vivid
imagination, Detective.

48:09.200 --> 48:11.670
~ Can I still call you that?
~ What?

48:11.720 --> 48:15.910
Detective. I heard you
were leaving the force.

48:15.960 --> 48:18.230
No, no, I'm still a copper.

48:18.280 --> 48:20.000
Which is how I got hold of this.

48:21.360 --> 48:24.510
These are the financial
records of Evett-Reed Associates -

48:24.560 --> 48:27.120
a private forensic firm,
based in Amersham.

48:29.840 --> 48:32.510
I knew you wouldn't be able to
resist playing detective.

48:32.560 --> 48:35.910
This shows that you submitted
an item for analysis

48:35.960 --> 48:38.390
around about the time
of the Hughes disappearance.

48:38.440 --> 48:42.990
Paid for it in cash, so it didn't
show up on your statements,

48:43.040 --> 48:46.400
but your name was still recorded.

48:55.440 --> 48:57.750
I think I'm going to call my lawyer.

48:57.800 --> 49:00.480
Oh, I think that's the worst
thing you could do.

49:01.600 --> 49:04.310
Julien Baptiste says you're going
to make a claim in your book

49:04.360 --> 49:07.550
that Tony Hughes killed Ian Garrett.

49:07.600 --> 49:11.150
When the case is reopened, you'll
find that's more than just a claim.

49:11.200 --> 49:14.030
The case isn't going to be
reopened though, is it?

49:14.080 --> 49:16.070
Because I'm going to make
you an offer.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.270
If you co-operate and if you give
back whatever you're holding,

49:19.320 --> 49:22.830
along with the lab report,
and kill this story,

49:22.880 --> 49:24.830
then I won't have to put you
in a French prison

49:24.880 --> 49:27.040
for obstruction of justice.

49:33.520 --> 49:35.800
You ever been in a French prison,
Malik?

49:37.120 --> 49:38.470
Obviously not.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.230
Charmataines was in one.

49:40.280 --> 49:42.880
In fact, he was murdered in one
a few hours ago.

49:52.040 --> 49:53.720
Have we got a deal, Malik?

51:01.240 --> 51:03.560
I've made bad decisions, yeah.

51:07.240 --> 51:09.560
But that doesn't make me
a bad person.

51:21.360 --> 51:25.190
Why would you say that Tony Hughes
killed Ian Garrett?

51:25.240 --> 51:27.440
Why would you say
something like that?

52:01.960 --> 52:04.390
'This is the
voicemail of Tony Hughes.

52:04.440 --> 52:07.150
'Sorry, I can't take your call.
Just leave your name and number

52:07.200 --> 52:08.910
'and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.'

52:08.960 --> 52:11.110
'Please enter the
four-digit code

52:11.160 --> 52:13.710
'to access your voicemail.'

52:13.760 --> 52:16.550
'Tony, I just told you
I wanted a divorce

52:16.600 --> 52:19.030
'and you looked at me like it was
nothing.

52:19.080 --> 52:21.920
'God, I'm just trying to get through
to you, to talk to you and...

52:24.080 --> 52:27.310
'I don't blame you for what you
did to Ian Garrett.

52:27.360 --> 52:29.960
'I mean... the things he did...

52:30.960 --> 52:34.470
'If you care about us
at all, please call me back.

52:34.520 --> 52:36.280
'Maybe it's not too late.'

52:37.840 --> 52:39.000
'Message deleted.'

52:49.120 --> 52:51.360
'You have no new messages.'

53:14.000 --> 53:15.150
Sylvie.

53:15.200 --> 53:16.990
They say on the news that they
found the boy.

53:17.040 --> 53:20.150
~ It's good news, huh?
~ Uh-huh.

53:20.200 --> 53:23.670
Look, Sylvie, I'm going to be
staying for a while anyway.

53:23.720 --> 53:26.830
The missing boy might have
nothing to do with Olly...

53:26.880 --> 53:29.430
but I've been doing some
digging of my own.

53:29.480 --> 53:31.470
I'm going to get
hold of the old police files.

53:31.520 --> 53:33.790
Even without them, I think
I've got a couple of leads.

53:33.840 --> 53:36.070
So... no time like the present.

53:36.120 --> 53:38.590
And I'd like my old room back,
if it's still available.

53:38.640 --> 53:40.070
Are you sure?

53:40.120 --> 53:42.520
It's not too much... a reminder?

53:44.280 --> 53:45.800
I want to be reminded.

53:47.480 --> 53:48.680
Of course, yes.

53:49.720 --> 53:51.040
Thanks.

54:10.120 --> 54:11.520
Hello.

55:11.840 --> 55:13.080
~ Hey. ~ Hey.

55:16.040 --> 55:17.630
I was just checking you were OK.

55:17.680 --> 55:19.270
Yeah, I-I'm fine.

55:19.320 --> 55:21.590
Do you want to come in?

55:21.640 --> 55:22.680
Yeah.

55:29.960 --> 55:32.670
I-I saw you and Tony,
at the commissariat...

55:32.720 --> 55:34.160
We're getting a divorce.

55:36.120 --> 55:38.240
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

55:44.400 --> 55:47.240
I think this last year we just
stayed together because of Olly.

55:49.160 --> 55:52.430
Because being with Tony
reminds me of him.

55:52.480 --> 55:54.360
Of what it was like to be a family.

55:55.920 --> 56:00.400
But neither of us were really there
for each other at all, or ourselves.

56:03.080 --> 56:04.360
I suppose when...

56:06.160 --> 56:09.070
.. all your dreams are about drowning
or suffocating,

56:09.120 --> 56:11.160
it's probably time to get out, eh?

56:14.320 --> 56:17.520
I've been through it.
I know.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.150
We appreciate you coming, Mark.

57:37.200 --> 57:38.440
Ca va?

57:46.040 --> 57:49.640
So, this is what Ziane
gave Malik Suri.

57:56.240 --> 57:59.390
The initial lab reports were
inconclusive about the bloodstains,

57:59.440 --> 58:01.310
but we have got enough to run
more DNA,

58:01.360 --> 58:03.960
so hopefully it'll come up
with something.

58:05.320 --> 58:06.880
I know what it is.

58:10.960 --> 58:12.400
I know who it belongs to.
