00:02.042 --> 00:03.167
NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.292 --> 00:07.292
GARY:
That is an unusual find.

00:07.458 --> 00:09.000
But you see on the top right?

00:09.208 --> 00:11.042
-GARY: Yeah.
-LAIRD: Didn't we get those

00:11.208 --> 00:13.333
crazy roman numerals on
the U-shaped structure, too?

00:13.500 --> 00:15.667
I got seven and a half foot
of tunnel.

00:15.792 --> 00:16.667
Yeah, it's nice, eh?

00:16.875 --> 00:18.333
STEVE:
You don't build a tunnel

00:18.542 --> 00:20.333
like this unless you're
moving something important.

00:20.542 --> 00:21.667
Yep.

00:21.833 --> 00:22.500
RICK:
We want to take a look

00:22.667 --> 00:23.333
down in that cavity.

00:23.542 --> 00:24.500
Here we go.

00:25.542 --> 00:26.375
SCOTT:
Slowly.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.708
Whoa.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.417
NARRATOR:
There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.542 --> 00:37.000
where people
have been looking for

00:37.208 --> 00:41.000
an incredible treasure
for more than 200 years.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.042
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.208 --> 00:46.208
with strange symbols
carved into it...

00:47.250 --> 00:50.417
...man-made workings
that date to medieval times,

00:50.583 --> 00:55.000
and a lead cross
whose origin may be connected

00:55.125 --> 00:56.125
to the Knights Templar.

00:56.292 --> 00:59.000
To date, six men have died

00:59.208 --> 01:01.667
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.833 --> 01:06.875
And according to legend,
one more will have to die

01:07.042 --> 01:10.667
before the treasure
can be found.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.292
â™ª â™ª

01:22.458 --> 01:23.917
-ALEX: Hey, guys.
-PETER: Hey.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.250
STEVE:
Hey, guys.

01:25.375 --> 01:27.750
-How you guys doing?
-Oh, Peter...

01:27.917 --> 01:29.333
NARRATOR:
With the dawn
of another morning

01:29.500 --> 01:31.708
on Oak Island comes renewed hope

01:31.875 --> 01:34.792
for brothers Rick and
Marty Lagina and their team

01:34.958 --> 01:39.208
that they will finally make
the ultimate discovery

01:39.375 --> 01:43.500
and solve the 228-year-old
treasure mystery.

01:43.708 --> 01:46.250
So, uh, what are we doing?

01:46.375 --> 01:48.417
We're pulling the casing right
now from the previous hole,

01:48.583 --> 01:50.625
D.5N-25.5.

01:50.708 --> 01:52.958
Right now we still have
some gaps in the data,

01:53.125 --> 01:54.417
so we wanted to move
the rig another five feet

01:54.542 --> 01:57.708
and we're gonna
drill D.5N-24.5

01:57.875 --> 01:59.292
and see if we can repeat

01:59.417 --> 02:01.208
-and hit the tunnel again.
-Okay.

02:02.542 --> 02:07.000
NARRATOR:
Today they are drilling
Borehole D5N-24.5,

02:07.167 --> 02:09.875
located some 28 feet east

02:10.042 --> 02:11.875
of the mid-18th
century structure

02:12.042 --> 02:13.667
known as the Garden Shaft.

02:13.875 --> 02:15.667
It is the team's hope

02:15.833 --> 02:18.667
that they will once again
penetrate a mysterious tunnel

02:18.833 --> 02:21.667
that is believed
to run directly westward

02:21.875 --> 02:24.000
below the shaft and into an area

02:24.125 --> 02:26.667
that has been dubbed
the Baby Blob.

02:26.875 --> 02:28.917
Over the past year,

02:29.083 --> 02:31.208
high-trace evidence
of precious metals

02:31.417 --> 02:33.667
has been detected
throughout this region,

02:33.833 --> 02:36.917
as well as directly beneath
the Garden Shaft.

02:37.125 --> 02:40.083
However, one week ago...

02:40.250 --> 02:41.333
There's our wood.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.167
There's our tunnel right there.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.542
...after once again
encountering this tunnel

02:45.708 --> 02:49.250
more than 30 feet to the east
of the Garden Shaft,

02:49.375 --> 02:52.167
the team detected
additional evidence

02:52.375 --> 02:55.042
of precious metals
on a wood sample.

02:55.167 --> 02:59.042
This means that the treasure
could actually lie buried

02:59.208 --> 03:01.792
anywhere throughout
the entire region.

03:01.917 --> 03:04.250
STEVE:
If we hit it a third time

03:04.417 --> 03:05.875
on the east side
of the Garden Shaft,

03:06.042 --> 03:06.708
I think that's probably
enough to confirm

03:06.875 --> 03:08.500
that this is our tunnel.

03:08.708 --> 03:10.292
-Mm-hmm.
-SCOTT: And we're still
waiting on dating

03:10.500 --> 03:12.458
-to come back on the wood
from this side as well.
-Yeah.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.083
We want to verify
that this is real,

03:14.250 --> 03:15.917
because if it is, this is
a reason to get excited.

03:16.042 --> 03:17.542
-Right.
-Mm-hmm.

03:17.667 --> 03:21.250
NARRATOR:
Now it is the team's goal

03:21.417 --> 03:23.333
to not only continue tracking
the mysterious tunnel

03:23.500 --> 03:25.792
in the direction
of the Garden Shaft

03:25.958 --> 03:28.167
and the Baby Blob but perhaps

03:28.375 --> 03:30.375
also make direct contact

03:30.542 --> 03:34.042
with the ultimate source
of the precious metals.

03:34.208 --> 03:35.792
SCOTT:
Once Dumas starts
to work in the shaft

03:35.958 --> 03:37.917
and they deepen that shaft,
if they confirm

03:38.083 --> 03:40.333
the tunnel below is there,
we can do some lateral drilling

03:40.500 --> 03:41.375
down the length of that tunnel
as well.

03:41.583 --> 03:42.958
-Yeah.
-That's the way to do it.

03:43.042 --> 03:44.000
TERRY:
Absolutely.

03:44.167 --> 03:46.000
We have to move things around,

03:46.083 --> 03:47.167
but hopefully
the treasure will be found

03:47.375 --> 03:49.208
partially because of it.

03:49.375 --> 03:52.667
NARRATOR:
Currently, Rick, Marty
and the team

03:52.833 --> 03:55.500
are awaiting permission
from the provincial government

03:55.625 --> 03:59.375
to allow a mining company named
Dumas Contracting Limited

03:59.542 --> 04:03.542
to extend the Garden Shaft
to a total depth of 98 feet.

04:03.708 --> 04:06.417
This will not only
help the team find out

04:06.583 --> 04:08.667
if the legendary treasure

04:08.875 --> 04:10.583
lies directly below
the structure

04:10.750 --> 04:13.375
but also allow them
to construct lateral tunnels

04:13.542 --> 04:16.500
toward any other
promising targets.

04:16.667 --> 04:18.958
RICK:
We have almost
singularly focused on

04:19.125 --> 04:21.125
the Garden Shaft extension

04:21.250 --> 04:23.833
and the possible tunneling
associated with it.

04:24.875 --> 04:27.333
Hopefully, we intercept
the tunnel that we know

04:27.542 --> 04:30.000
is beneath the Garden Shaft
with this borehole.

04:30.167 --> 04:32.083
Then, once Dumas arrives,

04:32.208 --> 04:34.417
we have the opportunity
to tunnel,

04:34.583 --> 04:37.625
which we hope will get us
closer to the treasure.

04:38.875 --> 04:39.792
Gotcha.

04:46.167 --> 04:48.250
All right. Here we go.

04:48.417 --> 04:50.500
-Okay.
-TERRY: I like this hole.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.708
TEDFORD:
I think she's going in.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.417
STEVE:
If we have enough data

04:55.583 --> 04:57.000
to suggest that this is
the continuous tunnel

04:57.208 --> 04:59.333
that goes under
the Garden Shaft,

04:59.500 --> 05:01.167
the second phase of this is
to get a sonar or camera down.

05:01.333 --> 05:02.750
Yeah, it'd be great to
get a camera in there

05:02.875 --> 05:04.292
and see where it's going.

05:04.458 --> 05:05.708
Perhaps this could lead
to something,

05:05.875 --> 05:07.208
and that's why we got
to track this down.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.583
-Yeah.
-PETER: Yeah.

05:08.750 --> 05:10.708
SCOTT:
Hopefully we're getting closer.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.000
NARRATOR:
While the drilling
operation continues

05:12.208 --> 05:14.375
in the Money Pit area...

05:18.750 --> 05:21.000
MARTY: Hello, guys.
I'm on the edge of my seat.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.583
-Hey, Marty.
-Hey.

05:22.708 --> 05:24.167
NARRATOR:
...Alex Lagina has

05:24.292 --> 05:26.500
joined his father Marty

05:26.625 --> 05:29.542
and Uncle Rick, along with
other members of the team,

05:29.708 --> 05:32.875
for a highly anticipated
meeting in the war room.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.583
We have C-14 results

05:34.750 --> 05:36.708
from wood retrieved as part of

05:36.917 --> 05:39.792
the sonic drill program
above the Money Pit,

05:39.958 --> 05:42.250
which, again,
is closely associated

05:42.375 --> 05:44.500
with the tunnels
that we have found.

05:44.708 --> 05:48.208
NARRATOR:
Marty and Rick's
business partner Craig Tester

05:48.375 --> 05:51.250
has just received
a carbon-dating report

05:51.417 --> 05:56.333
on a wood sample
from Borehole D5N-26.5,

05:56.542 --> 05:59.583
the borehole that encountered
the mysterious tunnel

05:59.708 --> 06:03.417
on the eastern side of
the Garden Shaft one week ago

06:03.583 --> 06:08.375
and which also contained trace
evidence of precious metals.

06:09.375 --> 06:12.000
We're hoping
that this data will confirm

06:12.208 --> 06:14.375
pre-searcher activity
in that area.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.417
So, I'm going
to turn it over to Craig,

06:16.542 --> 06:18.333
and hopefully he's got
good news for us all.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.458
CRAIG:
Okay. So, this is
where the tunnel

06:21.625 --> 06:24.375
is going to the west, going
to the Garden Shaft, really.

06:24.542 --> 06:26.250
And then the piece we took,

06:26.417 --> 06:27.917
we felt was the outer edge,

06:28.042 --> 06:30.333
which would be
the date it was cut down.

06:30.542 --> 06:32.542
The numbers come back

06:32.708 --> 06:37.625
55.6% from 1735 to 1804.

06:37.792 --> 06:38.625
Whoa.

06:39.875 --> 06:40.875
That's good.

06:41.042 --> 06:46.792
24.7%, 1656 to 1684.

06:46.958 --> 06:49.167
MARTY:
So, the unknown tunnel
almost has to be depositor,

06:49.333 --> 06:51.083
it's not a searcher.

06:51.250 --> 06:52.000
Correct.

06:52.208 --> 06:53.625
Wow.

06:55.833 --> 06:59.208
CHARLES:
Actually, those date ranges
brings up a theory to me,

06:59.375 --> 07:01.125
the Duc d'Anville expedition
in 1746

07:01.292 --> 07:02.917
that tried to recapture
Louisbourg.

07:04.542 --> 07:06.333
So, it's-- that certainly falls
in that range.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.625
-ALEX: Yeah.
-RICK: Correct.

07:07.833 --> 07:09.417
I agree.

07:09.625 --> 07:10.750
DOUG:
I found eight pages

07:10.875 --> 07:12.333
of a ship's log.

07:12.542 --> 07:14.875
NARRATOR:
In 2017,

07:15.042 --> 07:18.500
Oak Island historian
Doug Crowell discovered

07:18.708 --> 07:21.000
a portion
of a French naval report

07:21.167 --> 07:22.708
in the provincial archives

07:22.875 --> 07:26.125
related to the unsuccessful
attempt by France

07:26.292 --> 07:31.042
to reclaim Nova Scotia
from Great Britain in 1746.

07:31.208 --> 07:35.625
According to the ship's log,
prior to the French defeat,

07:35.750 --> 07:38.833
a secret operation to hide
a vast cache of valuables

07:39.042 --> 07:43.167
had taken place
somewhere south of Halifax.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.667
DOUG:
"September 8th.

07:44.875 --> 07:46.667
"It has been agreed
that a deep pit be dug

07:46.875 --> 07:48.500
"and treasure securely buried.

07:48.708 --> 07:49.625
"The pit to have
a secret entrance

07:49.750 --> 07:52.125
by a tunnel from the shore."

07:52.292 --> 07:55.917
NARRATOR:
It was carried out under the
command of the Duc d'Anville,

07:56.042 --> 07:58.875
a prominent member
of the Rochefoucauld family,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.333
who are believed
to have connections

08:01.542 --> 08:03.292
to the Order
of the Knights Templar

08:03.500 --> 08:06.500
dating back to the 12th century.

08:06.708 --> 08:08.667
In my mind,
there's no doubt that they're

08:08.833 --> 08:10.583
pointing right to Oak Island.

08:12.542 --> 08:16.042
MARTY (over video):
Those dates are
highly significant to me.

08:16.208 --> 08:18.958
This is an outlier in the sense
that it's much more definitive

08:19.167 --> 08:20.625
than almost everything we get.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.125
-ALEX: Mm-hmm.
-Absolutely.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.542
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

08:23.708 --> 08:25.667
that the team has now confirmed

08:25.875 --> 08:28.375
that the tunnel
running below the Garden Shaft,

08:28.542 --> 08:30.667
which has also been
scientifically dated

08:30.833 --> 08:33.458
to as early as 1735,

08:33.625 --> 08:36.667
may very well be related
to the ship's log

08:36.833 --> 08:40.042
that Doug Crowell found
in the Nova Scotia Archives?

08:40.208 --> 08:43.708
If so, could they have
finally discovered the key

08:43.875 --> 08:47.000
to solving
the Oak Island mystery?

08:47.125 --> 08:49.500
Here we have a very specific
piece of data,

08:49.667 --> 08:51.792
i.e. probability window,

08:51.958 --> 08:55.208
that could be associated with
the Duc d'Anville expedition

08:55.375 --> 08:57.000
to recapture Louisbourg.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.833
It has always been a player,
if you will,

09:00.042 --> 09:02.333
in terms of what happened here
on the island.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.250
JACK:
I've been working over on Lot 5,

09:05.375 --> 09:08.167
and this from 1656

09:08.333 --> 09:10.542
to 1804,

09:10.708 --> 09:13.417
that's the same date range
that we're dealing with

09:13.583 --> 09:16.167
of these hidden structures.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.667
Like, that round
circular feature,

09:18.875 --> 09:22.500
and also,
that really deep location,

09:22.708 --> 09:24.792
we were calling it Site 1.

09:24.958 --> 09:28.375
NARRATOR:
Since their purchase
one year ago of Lot 5--

09:28.542 --> 09:30.000
the four-acre property

09:30.208 --> 09:33.042
located on the western side
of the island--

09:33.250 --> 09:36.375
the team has made a number
of stunning discoveries,

09:36.542 --> 09:39.667
including three
ancient Roman coins

09:39.833 --> 09:43.000
as well as a 14th-century
lead barter token

09:43.125 --> 09:46.167
which is a compositional match
to the lead cross

09:46.292 --> 09:51.667
that was unearthed
at Smith's Cove back in 2017.

09:51.875 --> 09:55.167
However, they have also
investigated the remains

09:55.333 --> 09:58.125
of two mysterious
stone-lined structures.

09:58.292 --> 10:00.167
And within both of them,
they have found

10:00.333 --> 10:05.500
numerous artifacts that have
dated back to the mid-1700s.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.167
-RICK: You can't get
enough data.
-STEVE: Right.

10:07.292 --> 10:10.083
So, two things come of it. One,

10:10.208 --> 10:12.208
continue to explore Lot 5,

10:12.375 --> 10:14.292
and the second thing is,
you have to chase this tunnel.

10:14.417 --> 10:15.375
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:15.542 --> 10:16.833
Way to go, guys.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.667
Okey doke.
We will keep you apprised.

10:18.875 --> 10:20.250
MARTY:
All right.

10:20.375 --> 10:21.500
RICK:
All right, see you.

10:21.667 --> 10:22.667
MARTY:
See you, guys.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.333
-TERRY: Here comes
the core, guys.
-CHARLES: Yeah.

10:29.542 --> 10:31.083
68.

10:31.208 --> 10:33.000
-68.
-68.

10:33.167 --> 10:35.000
61 to 68.

10:35.208 --> 10:36.625
-Yeah.
-Thanks a lot.

10:36.833 --> 10:37.917
NARRATOR:
After their compelling meeting

10:38.083 --> 10:39.458
in the war room,

10:39.625 --> 10:42.083
Alex Lagina
and Charles Barkhouse

10:42.250 --> 10:45.125
have returned to the Money Pit
area to monitor

10:45.292 --> 10:47.167
the core-drilling operation

10:47.333 --> 10:50.667
in borehole D5N24.5.

10:50.875 --> 10:55.167
A borehole that they hope
will once again reach a tunnel

10:55.375 --> 10:57.958
that may lead directly below
the Garden Shaft

10:58.125 --> 11:01.167
and to the fabled
Oak Island treasure.

11:03.042 --> 11:04.625
Wow. This stuff is really soft.

11:04.792 --> 11:08.083
-Yeah.
-This is abnormally,
unusually soft.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.625
D5N24.5...

11:10.750 --> 11:13.625
could be very close
to the structure.

11:14.958 --> 11:16.833
Given the softness
of this material.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.875
That's very uncharacteristic.

11:20.042 --> 11:22.250
-Yeah, that's very soft.
-Wow, is that ever soft?

11:22.375 --> 11:23.708
Look at that.

11:23.875 --> 11:25.333
ALEX:
When we go into an area

11:25.542 --> 11:28.083
with softer soils,
saturated soils,

11:28.208 --> 11:30.000
usually, the only time that
happens here in the Money Pit

11:30.125 --> 11:31.833
is if we're drilling
near an old shaft

11:32.000 --> 11:34.625
or a collapsed tunnel
or, really,

11:34.792 --> 11:37.792
any other area where
somebody has done something.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.542
TERRY:
And certainly indicated

11:40.708 --> 11:42.125
that there are shafts
in this area, right?

11:42.292 --> 11:45.458
So, again, I think we're
close to something, but...

11:45.625 --> 11:47.417
at 78 feet, we're still about

11:47.583 --> 11:49.750
-25 feet above
our target horizon.
-CHARLES: Yeah.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.292
Yep.

11:51.458 --> 11:53.000
ALEX:
Okay. Well, we will see

11:53.167 --> 11:55.125
-what we can find out
with this hole.
-Yeah.

11:55.292 --> 11:57.417
NARRATOR:
As the drilling operation
continues

11:57.583 --> 11:59.792
in the Money Pit area...

12:01.417 --> 12:03.500
GARY:
This is our chance
to shine, Rick.

12:03.708 --> 12:05.833
-Lot 5.
-Yep.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.417
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina

12:07.625 --> 12:09.333
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

12:09.542 --> 12:13.208
arrive on Lot 5
to look for more clues

12:13.375 --> 12:16.417
that might reveal who built
the mysterious stone structures

12:16.583 --> 12:19.792
located in this area and why.

12:19.917 --> 12:22.292
-GARY: I've gone over
all this stuff...
-Mm-hmm.

12:22.458 --> 12:23.667
...and I've got a lot of flags.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.542
I've got a dozen flags
in this area.

12:25.708 --> 12:28.625
And all of these spoils came
from the bottom of that hole,

12:28.792 --> 12:32.042
so it should be
the deepest finds.

12:32.208 --> 12:35.250
NARRATOR:
They are starting their search
in the spoils

12:35.417 --> 12:38.667
that have recently been removed
from a circular depression.

12:38.875 --> 12:41.333
A feature where
they have found artifacts

12:41.542 --> 12:45.375
dating between the 17th
and mid-18th centuries.

12:45.542 --> 12:47.875
-Pretty good.
-Yeah, pretty good.

12:48.042 --> 12:50.000
I'm in agreement, mate.
Pretty good.

12:50.208 --> 12:52.958
NARRATOR:
After detecting and flagging

12:53.125 --> 12:56.125
a number of potential
targets earlier today,

12:56.292 --> 12:58.958
Gary and Rick
have now received permission

12:59.125 --> 13:02.500
from archaeologist Laird Niven
to dig them up.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.667
-(detector beeping)
-It's out.

13:04.875 --> 13:07.333
Come on.
Let's be something good.

13:07.542 --> 13:08.875
(high-pitched beeping)

13:10.208 --> 13:13.167
RICK:
Yeah. That right there? Oh.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.667
(rapid beeping)

13:14.833 --> 13:18.375
It's in my hand,
which means it's small.

13:21.458 --> 13:23.333
It's that.

13:23.542 --> 13:24.917
-A lead shot.
-Mm-hmm.

13:25.083 --> 13:26.833
RICK:
Small caliber, too.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.125
GARY:
Yeah. It's an oldie.

13:29.292 --> 13:31.583
-RICK: Very cool.
-We'll get the lead tested.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.125
I'd say it's period for the lot.

13:33.292 --> 13:35.542
All the finds we're finding
are going way back

13:35.708 --> 13:37.333
to the early 1700s.

13:37.542 --> 13:39.792
Could be anywhere in the 1700s.

13:39.917 --> 13:41.833
Or even a little bit older.

13:42.042 --> 13:43.500
It could be military.

13:43.708 --> 13:45.667
NARRATOR:
A lead shot?

13:45.875 --> 13:47.917
Found in the spoils removed

13:48.042 --> 13:50.625
from the circular feature
on Lot 5?

13:50.750 --> 13:54.542
And possibly dating back
to the 1700s?

13:54.708 --> 13:58.917
If so, could it be another
clue potentially related

13:59.042 --> 14:01.583
to the Duc d'Anville's
ship's log,

14:01.750 --> 14:03.625
which detailed
a French naval mission

14:03.833 --> 14:08.958
to hide treasure on an island
in this area back in 1746?

14:09.917 --> 14:11.542
GARY:
All right.

14:11.750 --> 14:13.667
-Let's find some more.
-RICK: Okay.

14:13.833 --> 14:15.667
(detector beeping)

14:15.875 --> 14:17.958
That could go either way.

14:30.917 --> 14:32.833
-There, now it's broken up.
-(detector beeping)

14:34.208 --> 14:36.375
-Sounding good.
-(high-pitched beeping)

14:41.958 --> 14:43.875
-That was it.
-A shell casing.

14:44.042 --> 14:46.625
Is it? No, it is not
a shell casing, mate.

14:46.833 --> 14:50.542
That is an unusual find.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.042
-Yeah, what is that?
-Look at that, mate.

14:53.208 --> 14:55.042
GARY:
I don't know.

14:55.208 --> 14:57.750
-You know, the archaeologists
are over there.
-Mm-hmm.

14:57.917 --> 15:00.667
-Should we call Helen over?
-RICK: Sure.

15:00.792 --> 15:03.375
Helen. Check this out.

15:04.542 --> 15:06.083
Hey, Gary.
You guys have found something?

15:06.292 --> 15:07.958
-GARY: Yeah, look at this.
-RICK: What do you make of that?

15:08.083 --> 15:09.542
HELEN:
Oh. Look at that.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.667
-GARY: Hopefully,
you have an idea...
-Oh, my God.

15:13.833 --> 15:15.875
-...of what it is.
-RICK: What is that?

15:16.083 --> 15:19.292
I would say it's, like,
you know, gun-related.

15:19.417 --> 15:21.333
-Yeah?
-It almost looks like a sight.

15:21.417 --> 15:24.917
GARY:
But it's really,
really special-looking,

15:25.083 --> 15:26.958
and I'm glad you went to "gun,"

15:27.125 --> 15:29.375
-because I was
thinking old guns.
-Yeah.

15:29.542 --> 15:31.125
Yeah.

15:31.250 --> 15:33.083
I mean, to me, that looks like
a gun sight, right?

15:33.250 --> 15:34.667
-Could be.
-HELEN: Yeah, that's nice.

15:34.875 --> 15:36.167
-GARY: For sure.
-Yeah.

15:36.333 --> 15:37.667
Well, thanks for your input,
Helen.

15:37.875 --> 15:39.000
-RICK: Yep.
-Okay.

15:39.208 --> 15:41.292
RICK:
We have found items

15:41.500 --> 15:45.667
that we believe
have some military context.

15:45.833 --> 15:47.417
This may be another of them.

15:47.542 --> 15:51.167
Again, this speaks
to an enterprise here

15:51.375 --> 15:53.583
could possibly
have been conducted

15:53.708 --> 15:56.125
by the Duc d'Anville expedition.

15:56.292 --> 15:58.375
The good news is,
they can be tested.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.917
How about taking this lot
back to the lab?

16:01.083 --> 16:04.167
I'm really, really curious.

16:04.292 --> 16:09.208
That copper barrel-shaped
artifact, that's special.

16:09.333 --> 16:12.000
Let's add that to the database
and keep going.

16:12.167 --> 16:14.708
GARY:
Okay, mate. Back to the lab.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.958
NARRATOR:
The following morning,

16:22.125 --> 16:24.583
while the drilling operation
continues

16:24.708 --> 16:26.208
in the Money Pit area...

16:28.125 --> 16:29.542
TEDFORD:
Looks like
we'll get 'er down that.

16:29.708 --> 16:31.625
COLTEN:
Another foot and a half.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.500
MARTY:
Gentlemen.

16:34.583 --> 16:38.417
We've assembled because we are
reaching a critical juncture.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.583
The very centerpiece
of this year's work

16:40.750 --> 16:43.042
is deepening the Garden Shaft.

16:43.208 --> 16:45.292
NARRATOR: ...Rick, Marty
and other members of the team

16:45.458 --> 16:47.542
gather in the war room
for a meeting

16:47.708 --> 16:50.208
via video conference
with representatives

16:50.375 --> 16:53.125
from Dumas Contracting Limited.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.833
MARTY:
Okay, well, you've got us all,

16:56.042 --> 16:57.875
uh, on the edge of our seats.

16:58.042 --> 16:59.875
We'd like to know
the latest developments,

17:00.042 --> 17:02.000
and when you're gonna be
out here making shaft.

17:02.167 --> 17:03.667
CAMERON (over video):
Yeah, very good.

17:03.833 --> 17:07.125
As everyone's aware,
uh, in order to facilitate

17:07.292 --> 17:09.292
the work planned
for Oak Island this year,

17:09.458 --> 17:12.000
we need to have a code
of practice in place

17:12.125 --> 17:14.500
that's authorized
by the Department of Labor

17:14.708 --> 17:16.667
in the province of Nova Scotia.

17:16.833 --> 17:20.000
NARRATOR:
While the team continues
their core-drilling effort

17:20.208 --> 17:22.167
to track the tunnel
that is believed

17:22.375 --> 17:25.333
to run ten feet below
the Garden Shaft,

17:25.542 --> 17:29.333
they are eager to know just
when Dumas will be authorized

17:29.417 --> 17:32.458
to deepen the structure
by some 20 feet

17:32.625 --> 17:36.042
so they can personally find out
just where the tunnel leads

17:36.208 --> 17:38.583
and what it may contain.

17:38.750 --> 17:41.125
CAMERON:
Most recently,
we've been updated

17:41.250 --> 17:43.000
by the Department of Labor,

17:43.125 --> 17:44.917
where they have
suggested segmenting

17:45.042 --> 17:47.167
the scopes of work this year

17:47.375 --> 17:50.000
into one code of practice
that would govern

17:50.167 --> 17:52.833
the deepening
of the existing Garden Shaft,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.333
and then a second code
of practice

17:54.542 --> 17:56.167
that would enable us
to go laterally

17:56.333 --> 17:58.458
and perform our tunneling work.

17:58.542 --> 18:00.917
-Yeah.
-TONY L.: The plan
would be to split up

18:01.125 --> 18:02.750
the-the code of practice,

18:02.875 --> 18:07.458
and we're definitely shooting
for a-as soon as possible to get

18:07.583 --> 18:09.583
everything, uh,
submitted to them,

18:09.708 --> 18:11.792
uh, with respect
to the shaft deepening.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.750
Okay.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.208
Dumas needs permission
from the various authorities

18:16.375 --> 18:19.250
here in Nova Scotia,
mainly involving safety.

18:19.375 --> 18:22.375
They have to get approval
on the code of practice,

18:22.583 --> 18:24.583
which basically sets out
all the conditions

18:24.750 --> 18:28.042
upon which they will be allowed
to deepen the Garden Shaft

18:28.208 --> 18:30.750
and possibly tunnel out from it.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.333
What is your expectation

18:32.500 --> 18:35.292
regarding issuance
of the code of practice?

18:35.458 --> 18:38.167
This code of practice,
we anticipate it being issued

18:38.375 --> 18:40.000
certainly before
the end of the month,

18:40.167 --> 18:42.375
related to, uh,
the shaft deepening.

18:42.542 --> 18:45.042
Otherwise,
our crews are prepared,

18:45.208 --> 18:47.500
and we are operationally ready
to come out

18:47.667 --> 18:49.792
and operate on the island
this summer.

18:49.917 --> 18:52.125
Okay. That's all my questions.

18:52.250 --> 18:54.417
-Anybody else?
-RICK: No, I'd just...

18:54.583 --> 18:56.292
-keep your fingers crossed.
-Yeah.

18:56.458 --> 18:58.208
RICK:
We have to respect

18:58.375 --> 19:00.167
and honor the requests
of the government authorities,

19:00.375 --> 19:04.042
but if the code of practice
is delayed much further,

19:04.208 --> 19:06.000
I think it's certainly
is going to affect

19:06.167 --> 19:08.208
all aspects of our work
in the Money Pit.

19:08.375 --> 19:11.125
Well, we look forward to
getting you guys back out here.

19:11.250 --> 19:14.208
-Yeah.
-This, uh, some exciting times,
and, you know,

19:14.417 --> 19:17.667
we welcome your participation
and efforts.

19:17.833 --> 19:20.250
CAMERON:
Thank you very much
to the entire team.

19:20.417 --> 19:21.833
We're gonna do this safely.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

19:24.208 --> 19:26.500
-Thank you.
-You got it. Bye.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.750
-MARTY: We'll be in touch.
-RICK: Thank you.

19:32.417 --> 19:34.500
TEDFORD: Looks like
we'll get 'er down that.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.792
NARRATOR:
As members of the Oak Island
team continue

19:36.958 --> 19:39.167
drilling in search
of a possible treasure tunnel

19:39.292 --> 19:41.792
in the Money Pit area...

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
JACK:
Hello, everybody.

19:44.208 --> 19:46.042
-Wow.
-JAMIE: Look who's here.

19:46.167 --> 19:48.292
NARRATOR:
...on Lot 5, Jack Begley

19:48.500 --> 19:51.958
joins Helen Sheldon,
Jamie Kouba,

19:52.125 --> 19:53.667
Lindy Martin and Fiona Steele

19:53.792 --> 19:57.417
as they investigate
a mysterious rock foundation

19:57.542 --> 20:01.000
that was first discovered
one year ago.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.667
Last year,
when we found that deep wall,

20:03.833 --> 20:06.833
I've been wondering
what this place is.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.500
-Yeah.
-NARRATOR: Curiously,

20:09.667 --> 20:12.917
when this feature
was found in 2022

20:13.042 --> 20:14.667
by Rick and Gary Drayton

20:14.875 --> 20:17.917
while they were
metal-detecting in the area,

20:18.083 --> 20:20.500
the team uncovered
numerous artifacts

20:20.625 --> 20:23.417
such as pottery and pipe stems
that are believed

20:23.625 --> 20:27.458
to date back
to approximately 1750.

20:27.667 --> 20:30.375
The same time period
as the Garden Shaft

20:30.583 --> 20:33.625
and mysterious tunnel that they
are currently investigating

20:33.792 --> 20:35.833
in the Money Pit.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.083
So, the plan is to get the
entire surface of it uncovered.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.750
-Mm-hmm.
-NARRATOR:
It was also believed

20:42.917 --> 20:44.625
by the archaeology team

20:44.792 --> 20:48.417
that this feature
was deliberately buried.

20:48.542 --> 20:51.542
Any idea yet
on what this might be?

20:51.708 --> 20:54.417
-HELEN: It's early days yet.
-Maybe it is some sort

20:54.583 --> 20:56.667
of a homestead,
but why would they bury it

20:56.875 --> 20:58.875
-under so much soil?
-There was a lot of soil

20:59.042 --> 21:01.125
-on top of it, I agree with you.
-Yeah.

21:01.292 --> 21:04.792
JACK:
Like, this isn't typical
for any settler to do, right?

21:04.917 --> 21:06.417
To just bury their homestead?

21:06.583 --> 21:09.167
No, normally,
it would be naturally buried.

21:09.375 --> 21:11.125
With the passage of time,
it would've filled in.

21:11.292 --> 21:13.333
See, I kind of feel like
someone was--

21:13.542 --> 21:15.833
might have been trying
to hide something.

21:15.958 --> 21:18.708
And why? We're so far away
from the Money Pit.

21:18.875 --> 21:21.625
People did used to bury
their things as well.

21:21.750 --> 21:24.750
-Mm-hmm.
-Right? You know,
their stash of precious items.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.708
JACK:
Yeah. Hopefully, there's
a bunch of items in here

21:27.875 --> 21:29.667
or maybe it leads deeper.

21:29.833 --> 21:32.125
There might be clues once
we get to the bottom of this.

21:32.292 --> 21:37.292
HELEN:
And if this is as early as
we think, like, even say 1750,

21:37.417 --> 21:39.667
this predates the discovery
of the Money Pit.

21:39.875 --> 21:43.125
So, it may tie in
to more than that. Who knows?

21:43.250 --> 21:44.750
Maybe it's an encampment.

21:44.917 --> 21:46.333
-Yeah, it's possible.
-And they buried them

21:46.542 --> 21:49.333
to hide evidence
of them being on this lot.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.167
But there's so many coins.

21:52.333 --> 21:53.708
And from what we found,

21:53.875 --> 21:56.667
it could be connected directly
to the Money Pit.

21:56.833 --> 21:58.833
We've only just started
digging up this feature,

21:59.042 --> 22:01.000
so, hopefully, the finds

22:01.167 --> 22:05.542
just continue to explain
exactly when it was first dug

22:05.667 --> 22:07.833
and what it might have
been used for.

22:08.042 --> 22:12.250
NARRATOR:
As members of the archaeological
team carefully excavate soil

22:12.375 --> 22:15.583
from within
the mysterious foundation,

22:15.750 --> 22:18.833
Fiona Steele sifts through
spoils with a fine screen

22:19.000 --> 22:22.542
to look for clues
and potential valuables.

22:24.458 --> 22:25.833
Helen, I actually found a shard,

22:26.000 --> 22:27.750
uh, which I'm surprised at,
in that top layer.

22:27.917 --> 22:30.833
-Did you really?
-Yeah, it's not very big, but...

22:31.000 --> 22:33.333
It was just in that top layer.

22:33.542 --> 22:34.500
-Just a little one, but...
-Yeah.

22:34.667 --> 22:37.000
...nonetheless, it is a shard.

22:37.208 --> 22:38.667
HELEN:
Yeah.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.792
Uh, possibly creamware.

22:42.875 --> 22:46.542
Because it has that slightly
yellowish tinge to the glaze.

22:46.708 --> 22:49.500
NARRATOR:
A possible piece
of creamware pottery?

22:49.708 --> 22:52.000
Because this type
of clay earthenware

22:52.208 --> 22:54.750
could date back to the mid-1700s

22:54.917 --> 22:57.292
and predate the discovery
of the Money Pit

22:57.417 --> 22:59.375
by nearly half a century,

22:59.542 --> 23:02.333
could it be another
critical piece of evidence

23:02.500 --> 23:04.167
to help identify

23:04.292 --> 23:07.500
who may have constructed
this feature?

23:07.667 --> 23:09.333
-So, we'll definitely...
-Slightly out of place.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.667
-...keep this separate, then.
-We'll keep it separate.

23:10.833 --> 23:11.833
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.333
Great find.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.667
FIONA:
I just wasn't expecting that.

23:14.833 --> 23:15.875
HELEN:
Yeah.

23:16.042 --> 23:18.042
JAMIE:
It's exciting.

23:18.208 --> 23:20.625
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon,

23:20.750 --> 23:23.125
in the Interpretive Centre...

23:23.250 --> 23:25.000
CRAIG:
So, what do we have today?

23:25.208 --> 23:28.208
This artifact came off of Lot 5,

23:28.417 --> 23:30.333
not too far off
the round feature.

23:30.542 --> 23:31.875
It may be gun-related.

23:32.083 --> 23:33.500
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina, Craig Tester

23:33.667 --> 23:36.250
and other members of the team

23:36.417 --> 23:38.458
meet with archaeologist
Laird Niven

23:38.583 --> 23:41.125
and archaeometallurgist
Emma Culligan

23:41.292 --> 23:43.417
to get their analysis
of the artifact

23:43.583 --> 23:46.417
found one day ago on Lot 5.

23:46.583 --> 23:50.042
So, it's a ramrod guide
for a musket.

23:51.208 --> 23:52.875
This would be in there,

23:53.042 --> 23:56.583
and the ramrod would
come through the front tube.

23:56.750 --> 23:58.542
This would be the center tube,

23:58.708 --> 24:01.000
and it would be held in
with the third one.

24:03.042 --> 24:06.000
NARRATOR:
The smoothbore long gun,
known as a musket,

24:06.167 --> 24:10.375
was invented in Europe near the
beginning of the 16th century.

24:10.542 --> 24:13.167
A feature known
as a ramrod guide

24:13.375 --> 24:15.833
was designed
for aiding the operator

24:15.958 --> 24:17.500
in the loading of lead
or stone projectiles

24:17.667 --> 24:20.500
into the muzzle of the musket.

24:20.667 --> 24:22.500
And what type of musket, mate?

24:22.667 --> 24:25.167
-That's the million-dollar
question.
-Exactly.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.250
If it's a musket, that would
make it pretty old, then.

24:27.375 --> 24:28.583
Yeah.

24:28.792 --> 24:31.250
GARY:
Anywhere from 1600s

24:31.375 --> 24:32.833
-to 1800s.
-LAIRD: Yeah.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.708
But you got to love
that patina, mate.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.500
-Yeah. Yeah.
-That tells you it's really old.

24:36.708 --> 24:38.417
LAIRD:
The only strange thing is that

24:38.625 --> 24:40.208
-there's a little
tiny hole here...
-Yeah.

24:40.375 --> 24:42.667
...which I haven't seen
in-in others.

24:42.792 --> 24:44.167
Well, it seems fancy.

24:44.333 --> 24:45.167
RICK:
But it'd be nice to know...

24:45.375 --> 24:47.333
French, British?

24:47.542 --> 24:48.792
-LAIRD: Mm-hmm.
-ALEX: Yeah.

24:48.958 --> 24:50.458
You know,
some nationality to that.

24:50.625 --> 24:52.375
EMMA:
Do you want to see the CT image?

24:52.542 --> 24:54.000
ALEX:
Sure.

24:55.042 --> 24:57.667
NARRATOR:
Earlier this morning,
Emma processed the artifact

24:57.833 --> 25:01.667
using the SkyScan 1273
CT scanner.

25:01.833 --> 25:05.250
By emitting nondestructive
X-ray radiation,

25:05.375 --> 25:09.375
the device can penetrate
built-up corrosion on objects,

25:09.542 --> 25:12.417
revealing clear 3D images
of them,

25:12.542 --> 25:14.958
along with their finer details.

25:17.458 --> 25:18.875
EMMA:
So, it's just loading.

25:20.833 --> 25:22.500
-LAIRD: The little hole
just turned big.
-GARY: Yeah.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.000
LAIRD:
That's a clean scan.

25:24.167 --> 25:25.833
-EMMA: Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:26.042 --> 25:27.167
LAIRD:
But you see on the top right?

25:27.333 --> 25:28.792
-ALEX: Yeah.
-GARY: Oh, yeah.

25:28.958 --> 25:30.500
ALEX:
It looks like
there's Roman numerals.

25:30.667 --> 25:32.625
Yeah. Didn't we get
those crazy Roman numerals

25:32.708 --> 25:34.667
-on the U-shaped structure?
-Yeah.

25:34.792 --> 25:36.208
Yeah.

25:36.375 --> 25:37.833
GARY:
That is really cool.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.458
ALEX: It looks like
there's Roman numerals.

25:44.625 --> 25:45.833
GARY:
That is really cool.

25:46.042 --> 25:49.000
It looks like "VIIII."

25:49.167 --> 25:52.375
NARRATOR: In the Interpretive
Centre, Rick Lagina,

25:52.542 --> 25:55.083
Craig Tester
and members of the team

25:55.208 --> 25:57.083
have just discovered
that the potentially ancient

25:57.208 --> 26:01.083
musket artifact,
found one day ago on Lot 5,

26:01.250 --> 26:04.750
curiously bears Roman numerals.

26:04.917 --> 26:07.625
The only thing I can think of
is that could be a...

26:08.708 --> 26:10.458
...it could be a regiment,
I guess.

26:10.625 --> 26:12.708
-It's an odd thing to mark.
-CRAIG: Yeah.

26:12.875 --> 26:16.500
GARY:
Yeah. Looks like a "VIIII,"
doesn't it?

26:16.708 --> 26:18.458
Yeah, and we saw that
in Smith's Cove.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.208
-Right.
-On the U-shaped structure.

26:20.375 --> 26:21.917
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

26:22.125 --> 26:24.792
NARRATOR:
In the early 1970s,

26:24.958 --> 26:28.333
Rick, Marty and Craig's
late partner Dan Blankenship

26:28.458 --> 26:31.958
built an earthen cofferdam
that surrounded Smith's Cove

26:32.125 --> 26:36.667
on the eastern end of Oak Island
in order to drain the area

26:36.875 --> 26:39.875
and look for evidence of the
legendary flood tunnel system

26:40.042 --> 26:43.500
that acted as a booby trap
for the original Money Pit.

26:43.708 --> 26:47.167
Dan was amazed
to uncover a 65-foot-long

26:47.333 --> 26:51.833
U-shaped wooden structure
that featured Roman numerals

26:51.958 --> 26:54.167
and which he believed
was constructed

26:54.375 --> 26:57.583
as a surrounding barrier
for the flood system.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.667
There's probably a ramrod

27:00.792 --> 27:02.833
waiting for us
somewhere in that area.

27:04.167 --> 27:06.500
NARRATOR:
Is it possible
that the U-shaped structure,

27:06.667 --> 27:08.500
along with the other features
and artifacts

27:08.667 --> 27:11.042
that have been found on Lot 5

27:11.208 --> 27:15.125
may be connected
to a 1746 ship's log

27:15.292 --> 27:19.000
which detailed how treasure
was "securely buried"

27:19.167 --> 27:22.292
in a deep pit
on a wooded island?

27:24.875 --> 27:26.583
RICK:
Finding the Roman numerals

27:26.792 --> 27:29.833
carved on that little bit
of ramrod guide,

27:30.042 --> 27:31.333
it brought back memories
of, certainly,

27:31.542 --> 27:32.917
the U-shaped structure.

27:33.083 --> 27:35.500
We've never found
Roman numerals before

27:35.625 --> 27:37.708
on any other artifact to date.

27:37.833 --> 27:40.083
And to have them found here,

27:40.292 --> 27:43.417
I think the two
are strongly connected.

27:44.625 --> 27:46.292
GARY:
Absolutely fantastic.

27:46.417 --> 27:49.292
This has given us hope that
there's more finds on Lot 5.

27:49.458 --> 27:51.458
I say we give it another shot.

27:51.625 --> 27:53.167
I want to find the rest of it.

27:53.333 --> 27:56.042
-I'm in.
-I'm with you.
-All right. Good luck.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.500
-RICK: Thank you, Laird.
-GARY: See you, Laird. Cheers.

27:57.708 --> 27:59.333
ALEX:
Thanks, Emma. Thanks, Laird.

28:02.667 --> 28:05.875
NARRATOR:
Following the meeting
in the Interpretive Centre...

28:06.042 --> 28:08.958
TERRY:
We're just at 98 feet
below grade.

28:09.042 --> 28:11.000
NARRATOR:
...Alex Lagina has joined

28:11.083 --> 28:14.792
other members of the team
in the Money Pit area.

28:14.875 --> 28:16.000
STEVE:
So, the next core

28:16.167 --> 28:18.958
-is our, uh, is our core.
-CHARLES: Yep.

28:19.083 --> 28:21.833
If it's there,
we'll see it in our next core.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.875
NARRATOR:
After nearly two days

28:25.042 --> 28:28.458
of slowly drilling through
previously disturbed soil,

28:28.625 --> 28:32.750
the team is about to reach
the target depth of 105 feet

28:32.875 --> 28:36.750
in borehole D5N24.5,

28:36.875 --> 28:39.583
where they hope to once again
encounter the tunnel

28:39.708 --> 28:43.708
that is believed to run
directly below the Garden Shaft.

28:50.375 --> 28:52.708
(metal grinding)

28:53.917 --> 28:55.708
This looks interesting.

28:58.542 --> 29:00.625
STEVE:
Well, we have a core coming.

29:00.792 --> 29:02.750
ALEX:
The core is up.

29:05.042 --> 29:08.333
-TERRY: Oh, my.
-Yeah.

29:08.542 --> 29:10.333
-CHARLES: I think we hit wood.
-Wow. It looks like

29:10.458 --> 29:12.875
a chunk of something
coming right out the base.

29:13.083 --> 29:15.958
Looks like we got wood
right off the get-go here, guys.

29:16.167 --> 29:18.458
CHARLES: You know, oftentimes,
when we find wood in cores,

29:18.625 --> 29:19.875
there's not much there.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.833
-Oh, yeah.
-TERRY: Wow.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.708
That is excellent.
That's really interesting.

29:26.875 --> 29:28.708
CHARLES:
However,

29:28.875 --> 29:31.167
this time, we pull up a timber.

29:31.375 --> 29:34.875
It's a vertical timber.
This is really odd.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.833
TERRY:
It looks like we've got
a section of beam.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.333
-STEVE: Oh, yeah. Look at it.
-Vertical support.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.042
Oh, that-- yeah, that was the
top-- that's up towards the top.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.375
-Thank you, Colten.
-What is that, Colten?

29:45.542 --> 29:46.667
-CHARLES: 108?
-COLTEN: Uh, 108.

29:46.792 --> 29:48.042
-108? This is the bottom.
-Thank you.

29:49.583 --> 29:51.250
Oh, wow. That's a lot of wood.

29:51.417 --> 29:53.458
That's a lot of wood, for sure.
My gosh, guys.

29:55.042 --> 29:56.667
What do you think it is, Terry?

29:56.875 --> 29:58.458
TERRY:
I think it's just uprights
of a tunnel.

30:01.042 --> 30:04.500
STEVE:
The main point of this borehole
is we're looking for that tunnel

30:04.708 --> 30:05.833
that goes under
the Garden Shaft.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.750
Hitting wood helps confirm

30:07.917 --> 30:09.708
that that is our tunnel.

30:09.875 --> 30:11.625
TEDFORD:
Little bit more.

30:11.792 --> 30:13.917
And the very top.

30:14.875 --> 30:16.292
TERRY:
Oh, my.

30:16.500 --> 30:20.917
That's a pretty significant
chunk of upright.

30:21.042 --> 30:23.417
-That's a big tunnel.
-That's a big tunnel, for sure.

30:23.542 --> 30:25.708
Six.

30:25.875 --> 30:27.833
Seven.

30:27.958 --> 30:30.125
So, I got seven and a half foot
of tunnel.

30:30.333 --> 30:32.083
-ALEX: I would agree with that.
-STEVE: Seven and a half
feet of tunnel?

30:32.292 --> 30:34.208
-Seven and a half foot.
-Oh, that's a lot longer
than I thought it was.

30:34.375 --> 30:35.667
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

30:35.833 --> 30:37.583
ALEX:
This core is almost 100% wood,

30:37.750 --> 30:40.542
which is really great, and it
means that we hit the tunnel.

30:40.708 --> 30:42.583
If that's true,
then this tunnel,

30:42.750 --> 30:46.000
and anything it's connected to,
becomes our next best target.

30:46.167 --> 30:48.083
Maybe the tunnel
leads to the Money Pit.

30:48.208 --> 30:50.167
CHARLES:
Let's get Rick up here.

30:50.375 --> 30:52.083
-TERRY: Absolutely.
-ALEX: I'll call him.

30:52.208 --> 30:53.375
Sounds good.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.917
Uncle Rick.

30:57.083 --> 30:58.167
Hey.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.417
So, I'm up with the guys
at the drill table.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.542
Uh, we just hit
our target depth.

31:02.708 --> 31:04.833
We were looking to hit a tunnel,
and what we did hit

31:04.958 --> 31:08.000
was approximately seven
and a half feet of upright.

31:10.750 --> 31:12.792
ALEX:
Yeah. But it does really,

31:12.958 --> 31:15.250
really well define
the height of the tunnel.

31:15.417 --> 31:16.500
if it's a tunnel.

31:20.417 --> 31:22.875
-ALEX: Sounds good.
We'll see you soon.
-TERRY: See you, Rick.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.708
TERRY:
We've got wood right there.

31:28.917 --> 31:30.625
And it stops cleanly
right there.

31:30.792 --> 31:32.625
That's the cut top right there.

31:32.792 --> 31:35.250
I knew if I stayed away long
enough, you'd find something.

31:35.375 --> 31:36.917
-Yeah. Exactly.
-Hi, Rick. How you doing?

31:37.042 --> 31:39.125
-Hey.
-There it is.

31:39.208 --> 31:41.833
NARRATOR:
After being informed
by his nephew Alex

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
that the team has just drilled

31:44.167 --> 31:47.875
into a seven-and-a-half-foot
tunnel more than 100 feet deep

31:48.042 --> 31:52.000
in borehole D5N24.5...

31:53.208 --> 31:55.083
-RICK: It's quite remarkable.
-ALEX: Yep.

31:55.292 --> 31:57.250
NARRATOR: ...Rick Lagina has
arrived in the Money Pit area

31:57.417 --> 32:01.833
to assess the potential
breakthrough discovery.

32:02.042 --> 32:03.833
TERRY:
There's the bottom right there

32:04.042 --> 32:05.375
at 108 feet below grade.

32:05.542 --> 32:09.333
I think we hit a whole section
of a support beam.

32:11.208 --> 32:12.458
RICK:
That looks like it's hand-cut.

32:12.625 --> 32:13.833
I see, yeah.

32:14.042 --> 32:16.000
I see hand-shaping there,
for sure.

32:16.167 --> 32:17.833
-STEVE: That's a good sign.
-Yep.

32:18.042 --> 32:20.208
-Yeah.
-STEVE: Yeah, that's
a really good sign.

32:20.375 --> 32:22.000
-Right here.
-Absolutely.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.000
TERRY:
You can see
an adze cutting in there.

32:24.167 --> 32:26.792
In here? Yeah, it's...

32:26.917 --> 32:28.958
-CHARLES: Yeah, you can see
right there, too. Look, see?
-TERRY: Beveled edge here. Yep.

32:29.125 --> 32:30.417
ALEX:
This is cut here.

32:30.583 --> 32:32.375
Oh, yeah.

32:32.542 --> 32:36.542
The adze cut
is really quite interesting.

32:36.708 --> 32:39.333
-TERRY: Hand-shapen
rather than milled.
-Yeah.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.375
NARRATOR:
Believed to have
first been invented

32:43.542 --> 32:47.250
more than 2,200 years ago
in ancient Egypt,

32:47.417 --> 32:50.167
an adze is a type
of construction tool

32:50.250 --> 32:51.500
featuring a sharp blade

32:51.708 --> 32:54.667
that runs perpendicular
to its handle.

32:54.833 --> 32:57.167
They were widely used
to shape wood

32:57.292 --> 32:59.375
for structures
and sailing vessels

32:59.542 --> 33:02.458
until being phased out
during the 18th century

33:02.625 --> 33:05.208
by mechanized saws.

33:05.375 --> 33:07.375
ALEX:
Somewhere, there is a shaft...

33:07.583 --> 33:10.500
-Somewhere there is a shaft.
-...from which this tunnel
was dug.

33:10.667 --> 33:13.125
And a big shaft,
because you think, if you're,

33:13.333 --> 33:14.875
if you're bringing down seven,

33:15.042 --> 33:16.958
-eight-foot-tall pieces
of lumber...
-Yeah.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.458
-...you don't have a tiny little
shaft you're going down into.
-That's it.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.542
Right.
(chuckles)

33:21.708 --> 33:24.458
NARRATOR:
If the team has truly found
a large tunnel

33:24.542 --> 33:26.583
that was constructed
with adze-cut timbers,

33:26.750 --> 33:29.167
could it mean they have
once again encountered

33:29.375 --> 33:33.458
the same tunnel that has been
dated to as early as 1735?

33:33.625 --> 33:37.333
Or might it be
an even older structure?

33:37.542 --> 33:40.042
STEVE:
For me, you don't build
a tunnel like this--

33:40.208 --> 33:42.292
-I mean, it's a seven
or eight-foot tunnel...
-Yep.

33:42.458 --> 33:43.708
...unless you are
moving material.

33:43.875 --> 33:45.375
-Yeah.
-Or you're moving

33:45.542 --> 33:47.250
something important.

33:50.208 --> 33:51.625
My opinion would be, unless
you were depositing something,

33:51.750 --> 33:53.958
I don't see why you would
build a seven-foot tunnel.

33:54.042 --> 33:56.167
'Cause you could very easily
walk down this.

33:56.375 --> 33:57.417
Yeah.

33:57.583 --> 34:00.792
RICK:
Given the 228-year history,

34:00.958 --> 34:03.500
no searcher
did this kind of work.

34:03.667 --> 34:06.292
The only other thing I've seen
that's that scale

34:06.458 --> 34:08.333
-is when we were in Italy
last year.
-Yeah.

34:08.500 --> 34:11.292
Which, at the time, I thought
were absolutely enormous.

34:11.375 --> 34:15.167
NARRATOR:
One year ago,
Rick and Alex Lagina,

34:15.333 --> 34:17.458
along with other members
of the team,

34:17.583 --> 34:20.958
traveled nearly 3,700 miles
to Italy

34:21.125 --> 34:23.500
in order to investigate
possible ties

34:23.708 --> 34:26.167
between the Knights Templar
and the Oak Island mystery.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.167
-ALEX: Boy.
-RICK: Stunning.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.542
-ALEX: Everything is just
so well built.
-Yeah.

34:30.708 --> 34:34.250
NARRATOR:
While there, they visited
two man-made cave systems

34:34.458 --> 34:36.833
that were used
by the Templar order between

34:36.917 --> 34:39.083
the 12th and 14th centuries.

34:39.250 --> 34:41.708
ALEX:
We have seen this symbol before.

34:41.875 --> 34:43.625
-RICK: H+O Stone.
-PETER: Yeah.

34:43.792 --> 34:45.875
NARRATOR:
One of the massive
labyrinths located

34:46.042 --> 34:48.000
in the town of Osimo

34:48.208 --> 34:50.917
contained a carved symbol
that was also found

34:51.125 --> 34:53.333
on Oak Island in the 1920s.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.417
ALEX:
Now, that's a direct tie
to Oak Island.

34:55.583 --> 34:58.042
This arm should be

34:58.208 --> 35:00.833
a bit longer than this one.

35:01.042 --> 35:02.667
NARRATOR:
And another cave system
that they visited

35:02.875 --> 35:05.125
in the nearby town of Camerano

35:05.292 --> 35:08.708
featured an entire section
that, incredibly,

35:08.875 --> 35:12.833
was an exact match in design
to the 14th-century lead cross

35:13.042 --> 35:17.125
that was found
on Oak Island in 2017.

35:17.250 --> 35:21.250
RICK:
3,000 years later,
it still stands.

35:21.417 --> 35:24.250
This, I think, is a twist,

35:24.375 --> 35:26.208
-and that's the worked
inside edge.
-Yep.

35:26.375 --> 35:28.000
RICK:
When all of the other
searcher tunnels

35:28.208 --> 35:29.708
that we've discovered have been

35:29.875 --> 35:31.083
four or five feet tall,

35:31.250 --> 35:33.625
certainly nothing taller
than that,

35:33.792 --> 35:36.167
why seven feet tall?

35:36.375 --> 35:39.375
And the enormity of the labor
associated with that.

35:39.542 --> 35:42.250
Will it prove
to be something dramatic?

35:42.417 --> 35:45.125
Let's get some cameras
in there, and then,

35:45.208 --> 35:47.083
develop a strategy
by which you can

35:47.208 --> 35:49.167
possibly physically access it.

35:49.375 --> 35:51.083
So, here's what I think.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.333
I think we should get Paul
up here with the camera...

35:53.542 --> 35:54.833
-Absolutely.
-...because we want
to take a look.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
The drillers, at this point,
are very important.

35:57.208 --> 35:58.792
They did the work, right?

35:58.958 --> 36:00.875
And they might be able to
tell us how they would proceed.

36:01.042 --> 36:02.167
And, uh,
Paul can start putting--

36:02.375 --> 36:04.000
Well, there they are
right there.

36:04.167 --> 36:05.542
BRENNAN:
Hello. How are you doing, guys?

36:05.667 --> 36:07.042
Well, you tell us.
That's-that's what

36:07.250 --> 36:08.208
I was just telling everybody.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.125
You guys did the work.

36:10.292 --> 36:13.333
So, we want to be able
to take a look,

36:13.458 --> 36:15.042
if possible,
down in that cavity,

36:15.208 --> 36:16.833
if it is a cavity.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.542
-How do we proceed from here?
-BRENNAN: Probably best

36:18.708 --> 36:21.083
to pull back that casing
to expose

36:21.208 --> 36:22.792
a relatively open hole.

36:22.958 --> 36:24.833
And that probably would be
your best chance of getting

36:25.000 --> 36:27.083
-an open hole
to physically see something.
-ALEX: Right.

36:27.208 --> 36:28.667
BRENNAN:
That's a good piece of wood
that you pulled out of there,

36:28.833 --> 36:30.208
-so there's a bit
of a void there.
-Well, it's...

36:30.375 --> 36:32.000
it's hand-cut,
which is quite interesting.

36:32.125 --> 36:34.333
-BRENNAN: Oh, yeah?
-TEDFORD: Oh, really?

36:34.458 --> 36:36.000
Yeah.

36:36.125 --> 36:38.000
Yeah, that's nice, eh?

36:38.167 --> 36:41.042
TERRY:
So, we should have an open
section of tunnel to look at.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.000
Okay. We're in your hands.

36:43.208 --> 36:44.583
-BRENNAN: All right.
Let's go for it.
-TEDFORD: Sounds good.

36:44.708 --> 36:46.208
-All righty. Thank you, guys.
-Thank you.

36:46.375 --> 36:47.750
STEVE:
This is exciting.

36:52.542 --> 36:54.667
PAUL: We have, uh, 30, 40 feet
before we get to that area.

36:54.833 --> 36:56.167
Then we'll have to zero it out
when you're right at the top

36:56.333 --> 36:57.875
of the casing and put it down.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.542
NARRATOR:
In the Money Pit area...

36:59.708 --> 37:02.000
-Hey.
-Hey, guys. How are you?
-RICK: You guys ready?

37:02.125 --> 37:04.375
NARRATOR:
...after drilling into
a seven-and-a-half-foot high,

37:04.542 --> 37:06.500
potentially ancient
wooden tunnel

37:06.708 --> 37:08.958
more than 100 feet below ground

37:09.125 --> 37:13.125
in borehole D5N24.5...

37:13.208 --> 37:15.375
-I'll start dropping this down.
-Yep.

37:15.583 --> 37:17.583
NARRATOR: ...Rick Lagina
and members of the team

37:17.750 --> 37:20.417
are about to lower a camera
down into it,

37:20.583 --> 37:23.458
in the hopes of seeing
what it might contain.

37:25.375 --> 37:27.333
-STEVE: Alex,
can you pull me tight?
-Yep.

37:27.542 --> 37:30.333
STEVE:
Okay. Now I'm gonna take
a little bit more slack.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.250
Here we go. I'm gonna
put it in and we'll zero it.

37:35.208 --> 37:36.917
PAUL:
The lights are on.
There you go.

37:42.833 --> 37:44.958
-All right, do we still
have a clean image?
-SCOTT: We do.

37:45.083 --> 37:46.500
-Yes.
-STEVE: Here we go.

37:46.667 --> 37:48.000
Okay, so we're going
down the casing.

37:48.208 --> 37:50.833
Clearly see the edge of it here.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.542
NARRATOR:
In order to investigate
the mysterious structure--

37:53.708 --> 37:56.167
or tunnel--
the team is utilizing

37:56.375 --> 38:00.708
the Inuktun Spectrum 120
high-definition camera.

38:00.875 --> 38:05.625
The device features a lens
that can pan 360 degrees,

38:05.792 --> 38:10.083
and is designed to operate
in low-light conditions.

38:10.292 --> 38:11.167
BRENNAN:
What are you at now?

38:11.375 --> 38:13.458
-ALEX: Five meters.
-Okay.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.375
ALEX:
The last time we drilled
into this tunnel

38:15.542 --> 38:17.000
on the east side
of the Garden Shaft,

38:17.208 --> 38:19.333
there seemed to be
an opening, a cavity.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.167
We couldn't use a camera
at the time,

38:21.333 --> 38:23.667
but we're hoping,
with this borehole today

38:23.833 --> 38:25.875
that-that we'll get
one more shot at it.

38:26.042 --> 38:27.667
The number one thing
is to get a camera down there

38:27.875 --> 38:29.500
and see what we've hit,

38:29.708 --> 38:32.958
and hopefully, after that,
we can get a clear image.

38:34.875 --> 38:36.292
-ALEX: I don't-- I don't...
-SCOTT: Whoa!

38:36.458 --> 38:37.333
-PAUL: Whoa.
-Okay. In water.

38:37.542 --> 38:39.542
Yeah. We just went pitch-black.

38:42.125 --> 38:43.958
We can't even see the casing.

38:44.125 --> 38:46.583
So, that's seven
and a half meters.

38:46.750 --> 38:47.833
-RICK: Right there.
-SCOTT: Yeah.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.333
Pull it, pull it back up
out of the water.

38:49.542 --> 38:50.958
Let's watch
the transition going in.

38:52.875 --> 38:54.292
-STEVE: Yeah.
-Look at the dirt on the lens.

38:54.417 --> 38:56.208
SCOTT:
Go in. Back down in.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.583
Slowly.

38:58.750 --> 39:00.750
There.

39:00.917 --> 39:02.500
As soon as we go into the water,
we're black.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.333
The second it drops under
an inch, the light's gone.

39:04.458 --> 39:06.333
-Like, pitch-black.
-Yeah.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.625
RICK:
Well, that pretty much
writes the tale right there.

39:11.833 --> 39:15.083
-SCOTT: Yeah.
-Oh, I can see the water.

39:15.208 --> 39:17.833
It's murky. Really murky.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.583
RICK:
I-I don't know that we need
to go any further here.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.875
-SCOTT: No.
-ALEX: Yeah.

39:24.042 --> 39:25.958
RICK:
I am really struggling a bit

39:26.125 --> 39:28.000
for one simple reason:

39:28.208 --> 39:30.167
the peculiarity
of the construct,

39:30.375 --> 39:32.417
i.e., being seven feet tall,

39:32.583 --> 39:36.833
it presents all kinds of
"What's here?"

39:37.000 --> 39:38.667
-It's all stirred up, for sure.
-SCOTT: Very fresh.

39:38.833 --> 39:40.917
It's-it's very recently
disturbed.

39:41.125 --> 39:43.250
RICK:
Where's the beginning?
Where's the end?

39:43.417 --> 39:44.875
Who was down here?

39:45.042 --> 39:47.083
There was a tremendous
amount of material

39:47.250 --> 39:49.000
to be removed from that.

39:49.208 --> 39:52.458
Why go to those efforts?
And that's a key question.

39:52.625 --> 39:54.417
Why do you need seven feet?

39:54.542 --> 39:56.417
What's in there?

39:56.583 --> 39:57.708
SCOTT:
Let's get the drill out the hole

39:57.875 --> 39:59.167
-so we can keep it moving.
-Yep.

39:59.292 --> 40:00.667
RICK:
I agree.

40:01.792 --> 40:03.333
We hit wood, we hit a void.

40:03.542 --> 40:05.583
It almost certainly is a tunnel.
It's at the right depth.

40:05.750 --> 40:10.083
It appears to be that the tunnel
from the Baby Blob area

40:10.250 --> 40:13.417
passes directly under the
Garden Shaft and continues east.

40:13.583 --> 40:16.292
A lot of data
points to the likelihood

40:16.458 --> 40:17.833
that there is something there,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.083
and I'm speaking about
the metals in the water.

40:20.292 --> 40:22.000
This tunnel
we're trying to follow

40:22.125 --> 40:23.792
and this chamber we've found

40:23.958 --> 40:26.292
might be the source
of the high metals.

40:26.417 --> 40:27.667
If there's a tunnel,
we'll follow it.

40:27.875 --> 40:30.333
So, all in all,

40:30.458 --> 40:32.500
I think we're closer
than we've ever been.

40:32.667 --> 40:34.167
PAUL:
So, how far
are you gonna go over

40:34.375 --> 40:36.083
for the next hole
after this one?

40:36.250 --> 40:37.833
SCOTT:
We can pull ahead and drill

40:38.042 --> 40:39.792
-around the 27 line...
-ALEX: Yeah, okay.

40:39.958 --> 40:42.042
...and look for connectivity
between the two tunnels.

40:42.208 --> 40:43.542
Okay. Sounds like a plan.

40:43.708 --> 40:45.167
-ALEX: All right.
-STEVE: See you, Steve.

40:45.333 --> 40:46.792
STEVE:
We'll see you later.

40:48.875 --> 40:50.792
NARRATOR:
For more than two centuries,

40:50.917 --> 40:53.167
generations of searchers
have made discoveries

40:53.375 --> 40:56.958
on Oak Island suggesting
that they were on the verge

40:57.083 --> 40:58.917
of solving the mystery,

40:59.042 --> 41:03.833
only to have their dreams dashed
by unforeseen events.

41:04.000 --> 41:08.667
Rick, Marty and their team have
also once again experienced

41:08.875 --> 41:14.208
the firm grip that the island
has long kept on her secrets.

41:14.375 --> 41:16.042
And while
all of their predecessors

41:16.208 --> 41:20.167
eventually had to give up
or move on,

41:20.292 --> 41:22.958
one thing is certain.

41:23.083 --> 41:26.667
The Laginas have no intention
of stopping

41:26.875 --> 41:32.500
until they hold the ultimate
answers in their hands.

41:35.042 --> 41:37.750
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:37.875 --> 41:40.292
-CHARLES: Here it comes.
-RICK: The Garden Shaft project

41:40.458 --> 41:41.542
is finally underway.

41:41.708 --> 41:43.333
BILL:
This way a bit.

41:43.458 --> 41:45.458
GARY:
Time to open Pandora's box.

41:45.542 --> 41:47.250
ALEX:
Oh, boy.

41:47.375 --> 41:48.500
-Wow.
-Wow.

41:48.583 --> 41:49.792
HELEN:
I'll tell you, Jack,

41:50.000 --> 41:51.333
it's the first time
in 40 years of fieldwork

41:51.417 --> 41:54.042
I have seen
something like this buried.

41:54.208 --> 41:55.500
They're hiding something.

41:55.667 --> 41:57.625
Ooh. Interesting.

42:01.292 --> 42:02.833
Brilliant.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.042
