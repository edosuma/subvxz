WEBVTT

00:03.742 --> 00:05.744
Okay, keep going,
keep going, keep going.

00:05.831 --> 00:07.485
Oh... all right.

00:07.572 --> 00:09.096
Swivel it, swivel it.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.836
MIKE: I'm wedged between
a washing machine

00:10.923 --> 00:12.012
and a toboggan.

00:12.099 --> 00:12.882
Swiveling's
not an option.

00:12.969 --> 00:13.796
Then, well, just...

00:13.883 --> 00:16.190
Then rotate it.

00:16.277 --> 00:17.800
Rotate is the
same as swivel!

00:17.887 --> 00:19.889
[sighs]

00:19.976 --> 00:21.151
Can you just push it.

00:21.238 --> 00:21.804
Wait, no!
Swivel it, swivel it!

00:21.891 --> 00:23.066
[mutters]

00:25.329 --> 00:26.896
Oh, did I do that?

00:26.983 --> 00:30.204
Let's just take a little break.

00:30.291 --> 00:33.076
I don't see why we have
to move back upstairs.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.991
Mike, we already
discussed this.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.775
Discussed? You said,
"Help me with this mattress."

00:36.862 --> 00:38.168
I thought we were
just flipping it

00:38.255 --> 00:39.822
to give you my divot
for a while.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.912
Really?
Drinking in the morning?

00:42.999 --> 00:46.829
We're moving.
You drink beer when you move.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.178
All right, split it with me.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.272
Too late.All right.

00:55.359 --> 00:56.665
[laughs]

00:56.752 --> 00:58.797
Come on, we tried living
in the basement.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.756
It didn't work out.For who?

01:00.843 --> 01:02.062
I love it down there.

01:02.149 --> 01:03.846
No, you don't.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.761
It's dark and damp,

01:05.848 --> 01:08.024
and it's like sleeping
in a cave.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.808
Hey, it works for bears.
If I didn't have a job,

01:09.895 --> 01:11.984
you wouldn't see me till spring.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.640
Upstairs is gonna be
light and airy.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.207
You're gonna feel
energized and creative.

01:17.294 --> 01:18.904
I don't want to feel
any of those things.

01:18.991 --> 01:21.472
I just want to have
reasonably effective sex

01:21.559 --> 01:23.866
with my wife and go to sleep.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.869
Well, imagine that and a window.

01:26.956 --> 01:27.870
Am I allowed to ask
how the book's coming?

01:27.957 --> 01:30.133
Sure, of course.

01:30.220 --> 01:30.960
But I shouldn't, right?

01:31.047 --> 01:32.918
I wouldn't.

01:33.005 --> 01:35.007
I mean, how is this thing
getting heavier?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.053
[groans]Are you lifting at all?

01:37.140 --> 01:38.620
I'm trying, but
my ass is about

01:38.707 --> 01:40.622
to take out half
your family photos.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.841
Well, who cares?
We'll make new memories.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.147
Let's lift on three.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.148
One, two...

01:45.235 --> 01:46.193
[yells]

01:49.892 --> 01:51.415
Did I do that?

01:51.502 --> 01:54.462
I'm gonna need another beer.

01:57.247 --> 02:00.032

02:25.580 --> 02:28.713
Let's me and you
write a bestseller.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.715
Oh, that's...

02:30.802 --> 02:32.804
Oh, God!

02:34.719 --> 02:36.678
That seems a little high there.

02:36.765 --> 02:37.679
Let's just...

02:37.766 --> 02:40.638
Ah, there we go.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.684
Ooh, that's...

02:44.207 --> 02:46.253
No, no... All right, let's...

02:46.340 --> 02:48.298
That's better.

02:48.385 --> 02:49.430
Yeah.

02:49.517 --> 02:52.389
Oof! Gee...

02:52.476 --> 02:53.477
Okay.

02:53.564 --> 02:55.958
No, let's see.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.699
You know what...

02:57.786 --> 02:59.744
All right, you were great.

03:02.225 --> 03:05.097
Hey, look at this.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.882
Good for me.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.623
Working on my core.

03:08.710 --> 03:09.667
Okay. Ooh!

03:15.717 --> 03:17.197
[grunts]

03:17.284 --> 03:18.546
All right, all right.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.852
All right. Aah!

03:22.680 --> 03:25.205
All right, all right, all right.

03:27.946 --> 03:28.730
Just got to brace myself.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.862
Got to brace.

03:30.949 --> 03:33.996
Got to brace my... self.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.653
Oh, for God sakes.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.351
Stupid thing. Out of here...

03:51.622 --> 03:52.580
Hey.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.059
Yeah, hey!

03:54.146 --> 03:55.583
Yeah.

03:55.670 --> 03:56.714
Welcome back to
the neighborhood.

03:56.801 --> 03:58.455
Thanks.I got to tell you.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.152
I-I kind of miss
having to listen

04:00.240 --> 04:01.066
to your husband take
a leak every night

04:01.153 --> 04:02.851
at 2:00 in the morning.

04:02.938 --> 04:03.982
Yeah.

04:04.069 --> 04:06.158
4:00 in the morning, 6:00.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.725
Yeah, I know, I know.
No, we're trying to...

04:07.812 --> 04:09.640
He's gonna get it checked out.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.209
Am I allowed to ask
how the book is coming?

04:13.296 --> 04:14.645
Yeah, of course.Should I?

04:14.732 --> 04:16.821
I wouldn't.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.868
What the hell is O'Donnell
doing down there?

04:19.955 --> 04:23.437
What?

04:23.524 --> 04:24.916
Looks like he's throwing out

04:25.003 --> 04:27.223
a whole closetful
of his wife's dresses.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.703
MOLLY: Huh.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.226
It's weird,
I-I can't even remember

04:30.313 --> 04:30.966
the last time I saw his wife.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.837
Or heard her.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.970
She was always screaming
at him about something.

04:35.057 --> 04:38.495
Yeah, you're right, it has
been real quiet over there.

04:38.582 --> 04:40.236
Well, you're the writer.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.673
Why does a man throw out
his wife's clothes?

04:42.760 --> 04:44.022
Oh, I don't know,
I've only been writing

04:44.109 --> 04:46.721
a couple of weeks, um...

04:46.808 --> 04:50.072
Maybe she doesn't
want them anymore.

04:50.159 --> 04:53.118
Maybe she's not around
to wear them anymore.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.949
Maybe she's not alive

04:58.036 --> 04:59.995
to wear them anymore.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.002
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck!

05:14.836 --> 05:17.752
Harry, I thought
you were lactose intolerant.

05:17.839 --> 05:21.669
Like you wouldn't believe.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.585
Yeah, well, that onion
dip is loaded with dairy.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.326
Really?

05:26.413 --> 05:28.371
Well, I came here to gamble.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.462
How would you guys feel
about raising the stakes?

05:32.549 --> 05:34.159
What's wrong
with quarter, nickel, dime?

05:34.246 --> 05:36.379
Nothing, if we're trying
to cycle up our periods.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.774
Let's keep the stakes low.

05:39.861 --> 05:42.516
I sent all my money to a
starving family in Africa.

05:42.603 --> 05:43.995
My own.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.346
Just keep the stakes
where they are.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.912
I just want to sit and relax.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.784
I've been running up
and down stairs all day.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.699
Oh, your pee-pee problem again?

05:51.786 --> 05:53.875
You got to get that looked at.

05:53.962 --> 05:56.530
No, I was moving.

05:56.617 --> 05:58.314
Molly thinks putting
our bedroom upstairs

05:58.401 --> 06:00.011
is better for her writing.

06:00.098 --> 06:01.186
Oh, how's that coming along?

06:01.273 --> 06:02.274
I don't know, we kind of have

06:02.362 --> 06:05.277
a "don't ask, don't ask" policy.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.323
Are we playing cards,
ladies, or talking?

06:07.410 --> 06:08.846
Put up your big blind, Harry.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.544
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm...

06:10.631 --> 06:10.979
Deal me out!

06:21.119 --> 06:22.207
[gasps] Oh, God!

06:22.294 --> 06:24.253
What'd I miss?

06:24.340 --> 06:26.473
He's still
in the back room.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.257
Oh, I've been in
enough back rooms

06:28.344 --> 06:30.433
to know nothing good
ever happens there.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.653
Oh, oh, oh, ooh!
He's on the move.

06:32.740 --> 06:33.915
He's dragging a big box
into the dining room.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.700
That son of a bitch.What?

06:36.787 --> 06:38.180
How does he have
a dining room?

06:38.267 --> 06:40.487
I thought we had
the same floor plan.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.706
Okay, he's left the box,
now he's headed...

06:42.793 --> 06:44.186
Ooh, he's heading
toward the bedroom.

06:44.273 --> 06:47.102
He better not have
a walk-in closet.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.756
Okay, okay, okay.

06:48.843 --> 06:49.713
Now he's taking off
his pants.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.323
Boxers?Briefs.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.935
Ooh, this guy is throwing up
red flags everywhere.

06:54.022 --> 06:56.633
Okay, he's walking
towards the bed.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.114
He's walking
towards the bed, and...

06:59.201 --> 07:01.508
Yeah, he's taking a nap.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.555
Sweet dreams,
you sick bastard.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.688
You know what?

07:07.775 --> 07:09.690
Let's go over what
we know so far, okay?

07:09.777 --> 07:10.908
Subject was seen throwing
out an armful of dresses

07:10.995 --> 07:12.954
still on the hangers.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.216
Ugly dresses.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.609
I agree, but that's conjecture.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.741
We're gonna build
this case on facts.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.395
Yeah.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.615
He was moving around
an awful lot of boxes.

07:21.702 --> 07:22.790
Ooh, boxes.

07:22.877 --> 07:23.791
And still no sign of the wife.

07:23.878 --> 07:27.316
"Wife, question mark."

07:27.403 --> 07:28.360
Devil's advocate.Okay.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.710
What if she left him?

07:29.797 --> 07:31.494
Way ahead of you.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.191
Then why wouldn't she bring
her ugly dresses, huh?

07:33.278 --> 07:34.889
And what about the dog?
Oh! What about the dog?

07:34.976 --> 07:36.847
God, she wouldn't
have left that.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.675
But how do we know it's her dog?

07:38.762 --> 07:40.198
'Cause it's a little,
yappy thing wearing a sweater.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.940
What kind of man
has a dog like that?

07:43.027 --> 07:44.246
A gay man.

07:44.333 --> 07:44.986
[slow gasp]

07:45.073 --> 07:48.468
Interesting.

07:48.555 --> 07:51.471
"Gay, question mark."

07:51.558 --> 07:53.951
Ooh, quiet neighbor realizes
late in life

07:54.038 --> 07:55.997
that he enjoys
the company of another man.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.302
[gasps]
She finds out his little secret.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.217
Maybe she caught...
[gasps]

07:59.304 --> 08:01.481
Maybe she caught him wearing
one of her ugly dresses!

08:03.004 --> 08:03.918
She's furious.

08:04.005 --> 08:04.919
There's a fight.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.442
Slap turns into a shove.

08:06.529 --> 08:07.965
That turns
into a fall down the stairs.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.445
He panics.
He has to get rid of the body.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.012
He's got to chop her up
into little bits

08:11.099 --> 08:12.361
and put her
into little nondescript boxes!

08:13.623 --> 08:14.668
God, that butcher thinks

08:14.755 --> 08:16.931
he's gonna get away with it.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.542
Or maybe he's just moving.

08:19.629 --> 08:22.414
Is "moving" on the board?
Is "moving" on the board?

08:22.502 --> 08:25.113
God! Let's stick to the facts!

08:31.249 --> 08:32.903
I really don't like the idea
of you going over there.

08:32.990 --> 08:35.079
I'm just sniffing around
while he's sleeping.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.299
What exactly
are you looking for?

08:37.386 --> 08:38.996
I don't know.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.303
Ooh, a dead woman would
really help our case.

08:41.390 --> 08:44.262
Be careful, baby.

08:44.349 --> 08:47.657
All right, don't get
soft on me, Joyce, okay?

08:47.744 --> 08:50.312
I need you to watch my 6:00.
I'm going in hot!

08:54.098 --> 08:56.666
[whistling]

09:02.106 --> 09:04.108
[yawning]

09:17.165 --> 09:18.079
Go look in the window.

09:24.215 --> 09:27.610
Hello?
Hi...

09:27.697 --> 09:30.613
Hi. Hey!

09:30.700 --> 09:32.397
I... I'll take those.

09:32.484 --> 09:34.008
Don't you live next door?I do.

09:34.095 --> 09:37.533
And I'm here picking up
Mr. O'Donnell's mail

09:37.620 --> 09:39.535
while he's out of town.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.189
Really? 'Cause I saw him
at the gym this morning.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.887
Well... I mean, if you're

09:43.974 --> 09:46.542
going on vacation,
you got to get into shape

09:46.629 --> 09:48.196
to look good
in that swimsuit, right?

09:48.283 --> 09:49.980
Yeah, you do.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.374
Well.

09:52.461 --> 09:53.723
Okay, keep it up!

09:53.810 --> 09:55.769
[clicks tongue]

09:55.856 --> 09:58.685
Why the postal service
is going in the crapper.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.776
Who we spying on?

10:02.863 --> 10:05.126
I'm watching your sister
swipe the neighbor's mail.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.737
Isn't it bad enough
we steal his Wi-Fi?

10:07.824 --> 10:09.130
Shut... [shushes]

10:09.217 --> 10:12.220
Junk, junk.

10:12.307 --> 10:14.352
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.659
Air Mexicano.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.618
I think somebody's
going to Mexico.

10:18.705 --> 10:21.055
Oh, or getting
a pre-approved credit card.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.320
JOYCE:
Oh, no! O'Donnell's awake.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.495
We got to warn her.

10:26.582 --> 10:29.106
I got this.
Ca-caw, ca-caw!

10:31.195 --> 10:34.938
Molly, I said,
"Ca-caw, ca-caw!"

10:42.467 --> 10:44.382
Ms. Flynn?Ooh, hey, neighbor.

10:44.469 --> 10:46.428
Got your mail by mistake.

10:49.257 --> 10:50.345
Okay, everybody checked.

10:50.432 --> 10:51.738
Here comes the turn.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.870
Two of clubs, a brick.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.045
Helps nobody.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.568
Action's on you, Dairy Queen.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.095
What's wild again?

11:01.182 --> 11:02.226
Nothing.

11:04.272 --> 11:06.013
Not even threes?

11:06.100 --> 11:07.231
No.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.190
I fold.

11:09.277 --> 11:13.194
So, Mike, what's it like
being married to a writer?

11:13.281 --> 11:15.544
I couldn't tell you. She really
hasn't written anything yet.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.589
Besides a little porn.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.114
Whatever.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.464
She's been at it
for three weeks.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.292
It takes me a month
to read a book.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.250
I should give her at least
that long for to write one.

11:26.337 --> 11:29.210
Well, you're
a better man than me.

11:29.297 --> 11:30.777
Nobody questions that.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.824
My point is

11:34.911 --> 11:36.347
as long as she's doing
this writing nonsense,

11:36.434 --> 11:37.784
you're on your own
to pay the bills.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.089
You know, at some point,
you're gonna have

11:39.176 --> 11:41.483
to give Molly a deadline,
you know?

11:41.570 --> 11:42.919
If she doesn't make any money
at being a writer,

11:43.006 --> 11:44.312
then she's got
to go get a real job.

11:44.399 --> 11:47.794
I guess a deadline
couldn't hurt.

11:47.881 --> 11:48.751
Really?

11:48.838 --> 11:50.057
Are you that stupid?

11:50.144 --> 11:52.146
What?

11:52.233 --> 11:54.844
You're gonna take advice
from a guy who moved out

11:54.931 --> 11:57.238
of his grandma's house
at 37 years old?

11:57.325 --> 12:00.676
Hey, hey, hey,
that woman's got a spa tub.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.156
That's not something
you just walk away from.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.332
Don't listen to any
of these clowns.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.377
They don't know anything
about marriage.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.249
When's the last time any of you
even had a date with a woman?

12:08.336 --> 12:11.034
I know your excuse.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.169
Hey, man, I'm just trying
to give this man some advice.

12:15.256 --> 12:16.692
You want advice?
Keep your mouth shut,

12:16.779 --> 12:18.650
your head down
and thank God every day

12:18.738 --> 12:21.741
that a woman will lay
beside you in bed.

12:23.612 --> 12:27.355
I do like having a
woman lie beside me.

12:27.442 --> 12:28.660
I'm gonna get another drink.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.359
Anybody need anything?

12:31.446 --> 12:33.404
Weren't you wearing
jeans before?

12:36.277 --> 12:38.322
Are those my sweatpants?

12:38.409 --> 12:40.977
I don't think so.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.070
[gasping for air]

12:47.157 --> 12:48.202
That was close.

12:48.289 --> 12:50.421
Close?

12:50.508 --> 12:52.162
He caught you in his bushes.Yes.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.121
He did, and when he helped
me up, we locked eyes.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.253
And I knew.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.428
And he knew I knew.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.474
And I knew he knew I knew.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.912
Hang on!
He's coming back out.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.174
Let me see.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.786
Oh, God.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.439
All right. Ooh!

13:08.526 --> 13:10.311
He's moving something
into the backyard.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.008
[gasps]
Oh, my God!

13:12.095 --> 13:13.053
What?

13:17.622 --> 13:20.147
Mrs. O'Donnell
bought the farm.

13:20.234 --> 13:23.803
E-I-E-I-O--
we've got you now!

13:30.331 --> 13:31.898
Shouldn't we just
call the cops?

13:31.985 --> 13:33.464
No!

13:33.551 --> 13:35.336
Until we know that his
wife is butchered

13:35.423 --> 13:36.903
and wrapped in
that Hefty bag,

13:36.990 --> 13:38.861
I don't want to jump
to conclusions.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.210
Fine, but if...

13:40.297 --> 13:42.430
if he comes back here
with an ax,

13:42.517 --> 13:44.127
it's every man for himself.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.477
I don't have to outrun him,
I just have to outrun you.

13:48.479 --> 13:51.874
If he thinks a locked gate
is gonna stop us,

13:51.961 --> 13:53.049
he doesn't know
who he's dealing with.

13:53.136 --> 13:54.442
All right, come on.Wha...?

13:54.529 --> 13:56.183
What are you doing?

13:56.270 --> 13:58.402
I'm gonna boost you
over the fence.What?

13:58.489 --> 14:00.491
Then you can unlock the gate,
and I can get in there.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.928
If I get trapped back there,

14:02.015 --> 14:04.017
what's stopping him
from killing me?

14:04.104 --> 14:05.496
Nothing, but don't
dwell on that.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.150
Come on, let's go.

14:07.237 --> 14:08.195
Oh... [huffs]

At least your wife
had the balls

14:32.088 --> 14:33.481
to say, "Screw you, world.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.265
I'm following my dreams
to be a writer."

14:35.352 --> 14:37.441
I admire that.

14:37.528 --> 14:38.790
Although, bless her heart,
she never told me

14:38.878 --> 14:42.577
a story I wanted
to hear again.

14:42.664 --> 14:43.534
I guess it was easier for me.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.449
Ever since I was a kid,

14:45.536 --> 14:47.147
my dream was to be a policeman.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.800
You know, assuming
the Spider-Man thing

14:48.888 --> 14:50.846
didn't work out.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.153
Being a cop was never my dream.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.590
It's just a job, not my passion.

14:55.677 --> 14:56.460
What is your passion?

14:56.547 --> 14:57.505

I think you a have
a beautiful singing voice.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.832
Heard that all my life.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.270
But having a voice like honey
don't guarantee you money.

15:23.357 --> 15:27.317
I also write my own lyrics.

15:27.404 --> 15:28.928
I escaped genocide.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.973
Pass the dip?

I, too, walked away
from my true calling.

I wanted to be a hairdresser.

Really?

15:47.816 --> 15:48.730
Oh, yeah.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.297
And I was damn good.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.776
Could frame any face
with the perfect do.

Cut, color, style,
the whole shebang.

15:55.258 --> 15:56.651
Why did you give it up?

15:56.738 --> 15:58.827
It was a different time.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.742
People weren't as accepting
as they are now.

16:00.829 --> 16:04.702
I'll never forget the look on
my dad's face when he walked in

locked that door!
