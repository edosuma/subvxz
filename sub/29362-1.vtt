00:12.940 --> 00:14.509

Hey, Ray.

00:27.580 --> 00:29.540
Yeah, man?

00:30.880 --> 00:33.879
Hey, um, you want to help
me out with the kids?

00:33.880 --> 00:35.848
- Yeah. All right. Yeah. Yeah.
- Appreciate it, man.

00:35.849 --> 00:38.059
- Which ones?
- Just take that group.

00:38.060 --> 00:39.319
- I've got these guys.
- Yeah. All right.

00:39.320 --> 00:40.478
All right. Let's do it.

00:43.815 --> 00:45.857
All right, so what we'll do is,

00:45.858 --> 00:48.193
we're just gonna do some
light sparring, uh...

00:48.194 --> 00:50.059
Don't try to knock each
other over, right?

00:50.060 --> 00:51.109
So, you guys go together.

00:51.110 --> 00:52.119
- Yeah.
- All right?

00:52.120 --> 00:53.209
And just keep it nice and friendly,

00:53.210 --> 00:56.661
and we'll do a bit of this,
do a bit of that. All right.

00:56.662 --> 00:58.079
Let's see what you got.

00:58.080 --> 00:59.789
Okay. Okay.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.819
All right. All right,
I'm gonna throw a few.

01:02.820 --> 01:04.209
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:05.430 --> 01:07.189
Ooh, okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:07.190 --> 01:08.755
Yeah. There you go.

01:08.756 --> 01:10.964
- Pretty good, pretty good. Yeah.
- Thanks.

01:10.965 --> 01:12.499
So, how long you been doing this for?

01:12.500 --> 01:14.636
- About a month.
- Is that all?

01:14.637 --> 01:16.919
I used to do jiujitsu
for a couple of years

01:16.920 --> 01:18.339
- before this, though.
- Oh, okay.

01:18.340 --> 01:20.099
Well, do you want to see
if you can get a takedown?

01:20.100 --> 01:21.640
- Sure.
- Cool. Well...

01:21.644 --> 01:23.090
Huh?

01:49.464 --> 01:51.006
You okay, old man?

01:51.007 --> 01:52.424
Yep.

01:52.425 --> 01:54.259
Should've tapped.

01:54.260 --> 01:56.387
No shit.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.909
All right, let's go. Back to work, guys.

02:02.910 --> 02:05.187
Back to the gym, back
to the ring. Let's do it.

02:20.260 --> 02:22.746
Feel my leg.

02:22.747 --> 02:25.699
- Why?
- Just feel it.

02:27.460 --> 02:29.869
- Hmm?
- They feel fat.

02:29.870 --> 02:32.279
- Do you think they feel fat?
- Not really.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.219
- Not really?
- Mm.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.423
Why didn't you say "no"?

02:35.424 --> 02:37.179
'Cause when you say "not really,"

02:37.180 --> 02:38.749
it kind of sounds like they are fat.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.556
Three million dollars! Do I hear...

02:41.557 --> 02:45.119
Don't get shitty.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.640
Do I hear 125?

02:47.647 --> 02:49.529
- 126?
- Don't get shitty.

02:49.530 --> 02:51.484
I'm not shitty.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.899
Are you all right?

03:01.270 --> 03:03.995
Yep.

03:03.996 --> 03:06.790
Do you mind not farting in my face?

03:06.791 --> 03:08.542
I didn't fart in your face.

03:08.543 --> 03:11.504
Yeah, come on, don't. It's disgusting.

03:12.600 --> 03:16.089
You should be happy I
fart in front of you.

03:16.090 --> 03:18.560
Why should I be happy?

03:19.720 --> 03:23.219
Well, I only fart in front of
people I'm comfortable with.

03:23.220 --> 03:25.959
Just 'cause you feel
comfortable doing something

03:25.960 --> 03:27.644
doesn't mean that you should do it.

03:27.645 --> 03:32.399
So, if I... if I felt comfortable

03:32.400 --> 03:35.486
taking a shit on your chest,
does it mean I should do it?

03:35.487 --> 03:37.579
Oh! Ah, sold...

03:37.580 --> 03:39.866
Do you want to take a shit on my chest?

03:39.867 --> 03:43.740
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

03:43.745 --> 03:45.930
Well?

03:48.250 --> 03:49.499
Go for it.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.710
Don't tempt me, pal.

03:51.711 --> 03:54.046
I'm daring you.

03:54.780 --> 03:56.089
All right.

03:56.090 --> 03:57.859
Huh?

03:57.860 --> 03:59.499
- I'll do it.
- Do it. Yeah, really?

03:59.500 --> 04:01.329
But you got to take
your pants off first,

04:01.330 --> 04:03.199
'cause you're just gonna end
up shitting in your pants.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.129
Huh?

04:05.130 --> 04:07.439
You're an idiot.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.339
- Where are you going?
- I got to have a wee.

04:10.340 --> 04:12.119
You weed half an hour ago.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.149
Thanks for keeping score.

04:14.150 --> 04:16.178
- So, what's your name, sir?
- Kevin.

04:16.180 --> 04:17.809
I haven't peed for hours.

04:17.810 --> 04:19.819
Good for you. It's not a competition.

04:19.820 --> 04:21.220
Yeah, it is.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.299
All right. Give us a kiss.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.080
I don't want to go to school today.

04:32.084 --> 04:34.003
Why not?

04:34.760 --> 04:37.459
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

04:37.460 --> 04:40.200
If there's something going
wrong, you can tell me.

04:40.210 --> 04:42.589
Come on. What's wrong?

04:42.590 --> 04:46.056
There's a girl at school, and
she's mean to me all the time.

04:46.057 --> 04:48.600
What's she doing?

04:48.601 --> 04:50.977
She calls me names and stuff.

04:50.978 --> 04:53.429
Have you told your teacher about it?

04:53.430 --> 04:55.159
No.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.819
Do you want me to talk to her about it?

04:56.820 --> 04:58.459
No, I'll tell her.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.029
Okay.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.669
Well, yeah, if you have
any problems, darling,

05:02.670 --> 05:04.039
you just talk to your teacher,

05:04.040 --> 05:05.769
'cause that's what
she's there for, okay?

05:05.770 --> 05:06.785
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

05:06.786 --> 05:07.969
Mwah. Love you.

05:07.970 --> 05:09.799
Bye. Love you.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.790
Have a good day.

05:18.422 --> 05:20.549
Mm.

05:32.060 --> 05:33.770
So, my girlfriend wanted

05:33.771 --> 05:36.940
to go out with her friends,
like, have a girls' night out,

05:36.941 --> 05:39.859
go clubbing, and, um...

05:39.860 --> 05:42.079
Well, I don't really like
her going out without me.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.639
So, yeah, we just started
fighting about it.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.743
And why don't you like her
going out without you?

05:48.744 --> 05:51.539
Oh, well...

05:51.540 --> 05:53.582
I just don't.

05:53.583 --> 05:56.039
Do you not trust her?

05:56.040 --> 05:59.059
I mean, has she ever... has
she ever cheated on you?

05:59.060 --> 06:00.759
No.

06:00.760 --> 06:04.302
No, no. It's nothing like that.
I mean, not that I know of.

06:05.460 --> 06:08.180
I guess the thing is, like...

06:09.120 --> 06:11.229
Well, yeah.

06:11.230 --> 06:13.768
Yeah, actually, I guess
I don't trust her.

06:13.769 --> 06:15.604
And why do you think that is?

06:15.605 --> 06:18.231
Well, she's, like,

06:18.232 --> 06:21.860
like, really fucking sexy,
you know. Like...

06:21.861 --> 06:24.613
when she goes out, she wears these tiny

06:24.614 --> 06:27.449
little fucking outfits, and,
you know, they don't leave

06:27.450 --> 06:29.701
a whole lot to the imagination, so...

06:29.702 --> 06:31.244
Here, look.

06:31.245 --> 06:33.164
I'll show you.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.749
- This is her.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.877
- She's a fucking stunner, man.
- Yeah.

06:40.660 --> 06:42.139
Let's have a look.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.089
Oh, holy shit, mate.

06:44.090 --> 06:45.499
If my missus looked like that,

06:45.500 --> 06:46.924
I'd never let her leave the house.

06:46.925 --> 06:49.439
Okay. Thank-thank you, Carlo.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.679
So, when me and her go out together,

06:52.680 --> 06:55.399
guys will just come up
and start hitting on her

06:55.400 --> 06:56.959
while I'm standing there.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.688
You know, like, that's,
like... the last guy

06:58.689 --> 07:00.679
I bashed was because of that.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.692
Uh, this fucking bloke just comes up

07:02.693 --> 07:05.979
and starts hitting on her right
in front of me, you know?

07:05.980 --> 07:07.399
- And she loves the attention, so...
- Right, so...

07:07.400 --> 07:09.069
Can I ask you something?

07:09.070 --> 07:10.319
Yeah.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.826
How many blokes has she slept with?

07:11.827 --> 07:14.239
- Ray...
- It's all right.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.829
Like, 30, 40.

07:15.830 --> 07:18.199
No wonder you don't trust her, man.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.127
I mean, shit, if she's slept
with that many blokes,

07:20.128 --> 07:22.329
what's to stop her from
sleeping with a few more?

07:22.330 --> 07:23.339
- You know what I mean?
- Exactly.

07:23.340 --> 07:25.089
- Ray, that's enough.
- I mean, you know,

07:25.090 --> 07:26.799
she goes there, she gets drunk.
Before you know it,

07:26.800 --> 07:28.678
- she's fucking somebody else.
- Ray.

07:29.870 --> 07:32.579
How about you keep your
misogyny to yourself?

07:32.580 --> 07:35.820
- My what?
- Your misogyny.

07:37.180 --> 07:39.270
- What's that?
- Um...

07:39.271 --> 07:41.369
A-According to the dictionary,

07:41.370 --> 07:45.444
a misogynist is a person
who despises women.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.820
I don't despise women.

07:47.822 --> 07:50.059
Well, from what I'm hearing here,

07:50.060 --> 07:53.202
it sounds like you don't
think very highly of them.

07:53.210 --> 07:57.129
I got a girlfriend. I got a daughter.

07:57.130 --> 07:58.969
Hey, what are you saying?

07:58.970 --> 08:01.377
Like, I hate 'em or something, or... ?

08:02.320 --> 08:04.069
Plenty of history's great misogynists

08:04.070 --> 08:06.673
have had daughters and girlfriends, Ray.

08:06.674 --> 08:08.217
Like who?

08:09.240 --> 08:11.178
Like... plenty.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.220
Name one.

08:15.224 --> 08:19.289
I think we should, um, move on.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.396
Uh...

08:21.460 --> 08:23.329
Hugo.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.859
I managed to drive to work
today without incident.

08:25.860 --> 08:28.479
That's terrific.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.480
Britt?

08:32.980 --> 08:36.703
What are you doing? You gonna
come have some tea or what?

08:36.703 --> 08:39.205
What you doing?

08:39.206 --> 08:41.460
What's the matter?

08:49.350 --> 08:50.676
Who put that up there?

08:52.150 --> 08:54.180
- Who did that?
- Taylor.

08:58.350 --> 09:02.604
Dad, why does she hate me so much?

09:02.605 --> 09:05.029
Look, not everybody is
gonna like you, darling.

09:05.030 --> 09:06.379
- Okay?
- Okay.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.669
And you can't make
people like you, okay?

09:09.670 --> 09:11.369
But you can make them fear you.

09:11.370 --> 09:14.769
I don't want people to be scared of me.

09:14.770 --> 09:16.659
Well, I'm not saying that, you know,

09:16.660 --> 09:18.519
you should make everybody scared of you.

09:18.520 --> 09:23.279
But, um, if people don't respect you,

09:23.280 --> 09:25.290
that's when you make 'em fear you.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.000
So, if people respect me,
I don't need to scare them?

09:29.006 --> 09:31.819
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

09:31.820 --> 09:35.559
But if people... see, if
people don't respect you,

09:35.560 --> 09:39.239
and you still treat them with respect,

09:39.240 --> 09:40.879
then you're a doormat,

09:40.880 --> 09:42.399
if you understand what I mean.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.840
- What does that mean?
- Well, you know, like a doormat.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.869
A doormat is a person who lets
other people walk all over 'em.

09:47.870 --> 09:48.979
- Okay?
- Okay.

09:48.980 --> 09:51.909
And that's not the kind
of person you want to be.

09:51.910 --> 09:54.073
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

09:55.750 --> 09:58.449
I'm gonna take care of this
problem for you, okay?

09:58.450 --> 10:00.149
- Okay.
- This Taylor...

10:00.150 --> 10:02.139
Look at me, darling. Look at me.

10:02.140 --> 10:04.499
She's not gonna bother you again, okay?

10:04.500 --> 10:05.859
All right? I promise you.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.019
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.159
Now, you want to come have some tea?

10:09.160 --> 10:10.256
What are we having?

10:11.020 --> 10:12.659
- Pizza.
- Johan's?

10:12.660 --> 10:13.799
Mm-hmm.

10:13.800 --> 10:14.979
With the bacon?

10:14.980 --> 10:16.059
Of course.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.509
- Okay.
- Yeah?

10:30.180 --> 10:32.800
Excuse me, guys.

10:34.070 --> 10:35.659
Thank you. Thank you.

10:35.660 --> 10:36.719
Sorry.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.820
Sorry. Sorry, guys.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.359
- Is that another goal?
- Yeah.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.439
What's up with all the
fucking hand passing, man?

10:44.440 --> 10:46.199
It's like a game of hot potato.

10:47.260 --> 10:48.999
These blokes need to harden up.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.379
Every time they get the
ball, they shit themselves.

10:51.380 --> 10:54.589
Mm.

10:54.590 --> 10:56.700
_

10:56.710 --> 10:59.305
Oh, shit.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.680
Mate, I need a favor.

11:02.683 --> 11:04.475
- What?
- I need you to come

11:04.476 --> 11:07.021
around my place and put a
password on my computer.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.499
Why?

11:09.500 --> 11:12.299
'Cause I'm watching too
much fucking porn, man.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.529
Every day, I'm jerking off.

11:14.530 --> 11:16.329
Twice a day sometimes.

11:16.330 --> 11:17.947
Fucking serious.

11:17.948 --> 11:19.849
Why don't you pick the password?

11:19.850 --> 11:23.203
'Cause if I know the password,
I'll just unblock it.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.872
Well, if you ask me, I'm
not gonna tell you.

11:25.873 --> 11:28.569
I know. That's the whole point of it.

11:30.570 --> 11:33.209
That's it. Just score another goal.

11:33.210 --> 11:34.760
Get on to it!

11:34.770 --> 11:37.717
- Well, don't get shitty.
- I won't.

11:37.718 --> 11:39.419
You will. You'll get shitty.
If I don't tell you

11:39.420 --> 11:40.511
what the password is, you'll get shitty.

11:40.512 --> 11:42.019
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will.

11:42.020 --> 11:43.182
Yeah, all right. Maybe I will,

11:43.183 --> 11:45.979
but no matter what,
just don't tell me, all right?

11:45.980 --> 11:48.144
And save my marriage, for God's sake.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.569
What's up?

12:02.040 --> 12:04.480
Have you got an address?

12:07.498 --> 12:09.329
Who's there?

12:09.330 --> 12:11.480
Freddy sent me over.

12:15.070 --> 12:16.419
Freddy sent you?

12:16.420 --> 12:17.925
Yep.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.280
- Who is it, man?
- I don't fucking know.

12:24.340 --> 12:25.739
Why?

12:25.740 --> 12:27.308
You want to let me in, mate, or what?

12:27.309 --> 12:30.230
- What's he want?
- I don't know.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.420
After you.

13:02.210 --> 13:03.769
H-How you doing?

13:03.770 --> 13:05.681
Hey, good, man. How you doing?

13:06.320 --> 13:07.619
- Good.
- Excellent.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.642
Yeah.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.270
So, Freddy's been trying to call you.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.329
Ah, yeah. No...

13:16.330 --> 13:18.026
I mean, we've run out of credit, eh.

13:18.027 --> 13:20.299
Sorry, man.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.655
Uh-huh.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.280
Sorry.

13:24.283 --> 13:26.829
So, you're supposed to do a
job for him or something?

13:26.830 --> 13:27.869
Oh.

13:27.870 --> 13:29.059
Yeah, yeah, job-job's done.

13:29.060 --> 13:30.330
- D-Do you want to see?
- Ah, yeah.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.165
- Yeah? Yeah, come...
- Yeah, come through.

13:32.166 --> 13:34.360
Just come this way, then.

14:01.380 --> 14:04.400
So, uh, we were gonna dump him
in the hills, but it got light,

14:04.406 --> 14:08.326
like, the sun came up, so
we brought him back here.

14:08.327 --> 14:11.497
But as soon as it gets dark,
we're gonna go get rid of him.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.999
How hot's the car?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.659
- What do you mean?
- Well, when did you steal it?

14:17.660 --> 14:19.399
Oh, it's my car.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.174
It's our car. It's our car.

14:30.933 --> 14:32.599
Yello?

14:32.600 --> 14:34.499
What do you think you're doing?

14:34.500 --> 14:35.519
What?

14:35.520 --> 14:37.539
You're using these
idiots to do hits now?

14:37.540 --> 14:40.039
No, mate. I just thought
I would give them a go

14:40.040 --> 14:41.309
and see how they went.

14:41.310 --> 14:43.119
Oh, okay. Well, I'll tell
you how they went, mate.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.499
They've grabbed this guy,

14:44.500 --> 14:46.364
they've killed him... whoever he was...

14:46.365 --> 14:49.019
and now they've got him
in the boot of their car

14:49.020 --> 14:50.368
in their garage

14:50.369 --> 14:52.495
because they didn't feel like
getting rid of the body just yet.

14:52.496 --> 14:55.219
Yeah, all right, settle...
settle down, will you, mate?

14:55.220 --> 14:57.540
Don't fucking tell me to settle down.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.659
- He hung up on me.
- Aw.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.539
Yello?

15:06.540 --> 15:09.519
Funny. Look, I'm sorry, mate, okay?

15:09.520 --> 15:11.889
I-I didn't think you'd mind
me using them on this one.

15:11.890 --> 15:13.809
I mean, they charge a
quarter what you do.

15:13.810 --> 15:15.059
All right? And, I mean,

15:15.060 --> 15:16.939
I'm having a bad week this week.

15:16.940 --> 15:20.019
Mate, you've been having a bad
week for the last 20 years.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.079
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Well, do something about it.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.943
- Well, like what?
- I don't know. Not my problem.

15:25.944 --> 15:28.339
- So, what do you want to do?
- I don't know. You tell me.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.789
I can't read it from here.
What do you think?

15:30.790 --> 15:32.559
Well, they're drug-fucked, mate.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.629
If they get pinched,
they're gonna roll on you.

15:34.630 --> 15:36.081
Yeah, okay, well, dig a hole,

15:36.082 --> 15:37.929
put the dead guy in, and, uh...

15:37.930 --> 15:39.659
and put the other two in with him.

15:39.660 --> 15:40.669
All right.

15:40.670 --> 15:42.212
How much is this gonna cost me?

15:42.213 --> 15:44.169
90.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.506
90?!

15:45.507 --> 15:47.579
Yeah. 30 each, mate.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.039
I'd charge anybody else 40 each.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.159
Yeah. Okay, and I appreciate that,

15:51.160 --> 15:53.639
but, look, it's not like you
got to do a lot of work here.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.379
You know? I mean, one
of them's dead already.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.185
Yeah, but I still got to bury him.

15:57.186 --> 15:59.730
Sure, but you're charging me
like you got to kill him.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.159
All right.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.485
Ten to get rid of the dead guy,

16:04.486 --> 16:06.319
30 each for the other two.

16:06.320 --> 16:07.599
- 70.
- Okay,

16:07.600 --> 16:09.364
and I appreciate the
discount there, mate,

16:09.365 --> 16:11.559
but-but the other two guys...

16:11.560 --> 16:13.493
I mean, you know, it's
not like you got to dig

16:13.494 --> 16:15.199
three holes, you know.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.989
Y-You're only gonna put 'em
all in the one hole, so...

16:17.990 --> 16:19.709
Yeah, but I got to dig
a much bigger hole.

16:19.710 --> 16:21.039
Well, get them to dig it.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.579
Why don't you come down here,
yeah, and you can dig it?

16:23.580 --> 16:24.630
I'm not gonna...

16:24.650 --> 16:26.049
Why would I...

16:26.050 --> 16:27.999
Fucking slimy little prick.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.370
Hung up on me again.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.979
- Hello?
- 60.

16:43.980 --> 16:46.840
65, take it or leave it.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.369
Yeah. Deal.

16:52.370 --> 16:54.823
I don't want to wait six
months for my money, either.

16:54.824 --> 16:57.120
Yeah, I know. You'll-you'll
have the money next week.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.209
You know the thing that
shits me about you?

17:00.210 --> 17:02.079
There's only one thing?

17:02.080 --> 17:04.833
You haggle over every cent
you got to pay me, right?

17:04.834 --> 17:07.213
And then you get into the
casino, you blow 100 grand

17:07.214 --> 17:09.959
- like it's nothing.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.659
Yeah, you know.

17:11.660 --> 17:13.759
All right. Bye.

17:32.850 --> 17:34.399
I'm gonna get a car.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.075
Oh, just use ours, mate.

17:36.076 --> 17:38.078
Can't use yours.

17:39.300 --> 17:42.419
Why not? Why not?

17:42.420 --> 17:44.650
I don't know, man.

18:11.194 --> 18:14.229
- Lift him up.
- I am, man. Wait.

18:14.230 --> 18:15.670
Got him?

18:17.960 --> 18:20.620
- Ooh!
- You fucking idiot.

18:20.621 --> 18:21.819
Shut up, man.

18:21.820 --> 18:23.205
You want to take the head?!

18:28.770 --> 18:31.548
- Ah, man. This stinks.
- Fuck.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.759
How do you get on with the ex?

18:53.760 --> 18:56.399
Oh, not too bad. She's remarried, but...

18:56.400 --> 18:58.299
... yeah, we get on.

18:59.400 --> 19:02.299
I've got a... I-I got a daughter.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.249
- Eh?
- Yeah.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.409
How old is she?

19:05.410 --> 19:07.659
She's, um...

19:07.660 --> 19:09.289
- she's six, eh.
- Mm.

19:09.290 --> 19:11.480
Ava.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.979
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

19:14.980 --> 19:17.511
- She gets that-that from her mum, eh?
- Mm.

19:17.512 --> 19:19.659
You see her?

19:19.660 --> 19:21.972
Nah. Not-not anymore, really.

19:21.973 --> 19:24.059
How come?

19:24.060 --> 19:25.879
Uh, the ex won't let me, man.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.479
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.389
That's cool, man. Like...

19:30.390 --> 19:32.919
I know I'm a fuck-up.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.499
Just need to get off the drugs, man.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.569
Yeah.

19:35.570 --> 19:38.009
Tell me about it, bro. Fuck.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.669
I tell you, man, these...

19:39.670 --> 19:41.399
these last 24 hours, I just...

19:41.400 --> 19:42.679
I'm not cut out for this shit. I...

19:42.680 --> 19:45.379
This is not me. No. No offense, eh.

19:45.380 --> 19:48.480
Eh, it's not for everybody, mate, so...

19:50.660 --> 19:53.419
So are you, like, you from
Sydney originally, or...

19:53.420 --> 19:55.559
Nah. Country boy.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.219
What brought you up here?

19:57.220 --> 20:01.089
You know, work, mainly, but, uh...

20:01.090 --> 20:03.849
Eh, I wouldn't mind
getting back to the...

20:03.850 --> 20:06.059
back to the country one day,

20:06.060 --> 20:07.169
but I got my daughter here

20:07.170 --> 20:09.469
- and me brother, so...
- Oh.

20:09.470 --> 20:11.619
- I got a bro as well, man.
- Mm.

20:11.620 --> 20:14.009
- He's, uh, he's back in Perth.
- Yeah.

20:14.010 --> 20:15.401
He's a fucking muso, man.

20:15.402 --> 20:16.779
He's killing it, eh, like...

20:16.780 --> 20:18.509
You heard of the band More or Less?

20:18.510 --> 20:20.679
- No.
- Yeah.

20:20.680 --> 20:21.899
We started it together, man,

20:21.900 --> 20:23.199
- like, me and him.
- Mm.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.479
We used to write songs
together and shit.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.739
Fucking, like, playing gigs.

20:26.740 --> 20:29.999
Fucking...

20:30.000 --> 20:34.019
Do-do you, like, play any
musical instruments?

20:34.020 --> 20:35.459
Nah.

20:35.460 --> 20:37.099
Tried to learn how to play the drums

20:37.100 --> 20:38.629
when I was a kid, but...

20:38.630 --> 20:40.029
That's what I am, eh.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.469
Yeah, I'm a drummer.

20:41.470 --> 20:43.169
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

20:43.170 --> 20:44.931
Yeah, I-I'll fucking teach you. Hey.

20:44.932 --> 20:47.469
Yeah. Well, I don't
have a drum kit, so...

20:47.470 --> 20:49.269
Yeah. I-I don't either, man.

20:49.270 --> 20:51.979
But if you buy one, then
I'll-I'll teach you how...

20:51.980 --> 20:54.109
- I wouldn't charge.
- Mm.

20:54.110 --> 20:57.640
It'd just be... We'd have,
like, fucking drum sessions.
