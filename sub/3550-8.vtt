WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:06.107
NO SEX FOR AT LEAST A MONTH.
 BREE MADE A DECISION...

00:06.107 --> 00:08.138
FOCUS ON GETTING ME
A DIVORCE.
 AND HIRED ANGIE.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.511
LET'S GET COOKIN'.
 GABY STRUGGLED AT HOME.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.284
WHAT IS GOING ON?
 IT'S CALLED HOMESCHOOLING!

00:13.284 --> 00:15.446
LYNETTE'S BODY WAS CHANGING.

00:15.446 --> 00:18.149
I HAVE TO HIDE THESE THINGS
AT WORK

00:18.149 --> 00:20.191
SO CARLOS DOESN'T FIND OUT
I'M PREGNANT.

00:20.191 --> 00:22.193
THE COPS WANTED TO KNOW
WHERE YOU WERE

00:22.193 --> 00:24.495
THE NIGHT THAT JULIE MAYER
WAS STRANGLED.
 YOU KNOW I NEVER ATTACKED HER.

00:24.495 --> 00:27.198
ANGIE KNEW ABOUT THE AFFAIR.
 UHH!

00:27.198 --> 00:29.700
IS IT TRUE YOU SHOT
KATHERINE MAYFAIR?

00:29.700 --> 00:32.403
AND SUSAN GOT IN TROUBLE.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.570
(Mary Alice)
IF SOMEONE WANTED PROOF

00:39.570 --> 00:44.044
THAT JUDGE MARY GALLAGHER
HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR,

00:44.044 --> 00:48.779
ALL THEY NEEDED TO DO WAS
WATCH HER PRONOUNCE SENTENCE.

00:48.779 --> 00:52.683
FOR THE SLUM LORD
WHO REFUSED TO FIX A FURNACE...

00:52.683 --> 00:56.087
YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN YOUR OWN
TENEMENT FOR A MONTH...

00:56.087 --> 00:59.059
STARTING IN DECEMBER.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.062
THE WOMAN WHO THREW A PHONE
AT HER MAID...

01:02.062 --> 01:05.666
YOU WILL CLEAN MRS. GARCIA'S
HOME FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS.

01:05.666 --> 01:09.100
AND, YES, YOU WILL DO WINDOWS.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.102
FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL COACH

01:11.102 --> 01:14.105
WHO MADE LEWD REMARKS
TO A CHEERLEADER...

01:14.105 --> 01:16.076
AT THE NEXT SCHOOL ASSEMBLY,
YOU WILL PERFORM A CHEER...

01:16.076 --> 01:17.408
IN UNIFORM.

01:17.408 --> 01:22.613
AND I'D SHAVE THOSE LEGS
IF I WERE YOU.

01:22.613 --> 01:24.615
AND THEN THERE WAS

01:24.615 --> 01:27.618
THE CASE OF THE HOUSEWIFE
WHO SHOT HER NEIGHBOR...

01:27.618 --> 01:30.361
(whispering indistinctly)

01:30.361 --> 01:33.724
SO SHE JUST POPPED UP
IN MY WINDOW, AND I FIRED.

01:33.724 --> 01:35.366
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

01:35.366 --> 01:39.130
LIAR! IT WAS NO ACCIDENT!
SHE WANTED ME DEAD.

01:39.130 --> 01:41.632
I DID NOT.
AT LEAST, NOT THEN.

01:41.632 --> 01:44.875
AS YOU CAN SEE, YOUR HONOR, THIS
IS AN UNFORTUNATE SITUATION.

01:44.875 --> 01:46.877
IT'S A MESS IS WHAT IT IS.

01:46.877 --> 01:48.809
I ASSUME
THERE'S SOME HISTORY HERE.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.881
SHE ONCE DATED MY HUSBAND.
 SHE STOLE HIM FROM ME.

01:50.881 --> 01:55.646
STOLE? HE CAME SCREAMING BACK
LIKE HE WAS RUNNING FROM A FIRE.

01:55.646 --> 01:57.648
ENOUGH.

01:57.648 --> 02:00.821
I TAKE IT
YOU'RE THE MAN IN QUESTION.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.295
OH.

02:04.295 --> 02:05.796
YES, YOUR HONOR.

02:05.796 --> 02:09.229
I COULD SEE SHOOTING SOMEONE
OVER YOU.

02:09.229 --> 02:12.233
THANK YOU?

02:12.233 --> 02:15.666
OKAY, I'M GONNA RULE NOW.

02:15.666 --> 02:18.709
MY INCLINATION IS TO AVOID
GIVING OUT JAIL TIME

02:18.709 --> 02:20.711
IN THIS CASE.

02:20.711 --> 02:22.142
I OBJECT!

02:22.142 --> 02:23.874
OVERRULED!

02:23.874 --> 02:27.178
HOWEVER...
A FIREARM WAS DISCHARGED,

02:27.178 --> 02:29.420
AND THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES
FOR THAT.

02:29.420 --> 02:31.652
YOUR HONOR, BEFORE YOU
HAND DOWN YOUR RULING,

02:31.652 --> 02:33.784
MAY I SAY SOMETHING?

02:33.784 --> 02:35.886
MAKE IT QUICK. I ALREADY
FIND YOU UNINTERESTING.

02:35.886 --> 02:37.928
HA!

02:40.191 --> 02:44.865
NOT ONLY DID SUSAN SHOOT ME
AT POINT-BLANK RANGE,

02:44.865 --> 02:48.299
SHE TRASHED ME TO ALL OF
MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,

02:48.299 --> 02:51.242
TELLING THEM I WAS SOME KIND
OF CRAZY, STALKING NUT!

02:51.242 --> 02:53.774
THAT TRUE?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.447
HAVE YOU BEEN TRASHING HER?

02:59.250 --> 03:00.651
I...

03:00.651 --> 03:02.583
NEVER SAID "NUT."

03:02.583 --> 03:05.556
I... SAID "LOON."

03:05.556 --> 03:08.459
MM-HMM.

03:08.459 --> 03:10.461
(clicks tongue)

03:10.461 --> 03:11.462
(scoffs)

03:11.462 --> 03:13.794
MRS. DELFINO...

03:15.326 --> 03:19.530
OKAY, I TRASHED HER A LITTLE.

03:19.530 --> 03:21.532
BUT WHAT I SAID WAS TRUE,

03:21.532 --> 03:23.534
AND THAT'S FREE SPEECH.

03:23.534 --> 03:25.536
YOU CAN'T PUNISH ME FOR THAT.

03:26.907 --> 03:30.541
YES, WHEN IT CAME
TO SENTENCING,

03:30.541 --> 03:33.814
JUDGE MARY GALLAGHER
HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.550
BUT NOT EVERYONE

03:39.550 --> 03:42.393
FOUND HER FUNNY.

03:55.406 --> 03:58.238
THERE IS A COFFEE SHOP
IN FAIRVIEW.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.973
(door bells jingle)
 IT'S KNOWN AS A PLACE WHERE YOU
CAN READ YOUR MORNING PAPER...

04:02.973 --> 04:07.017
WHERE YOU CAN MEET
YOUR FRIENDS...

04:07.017 --> 04:11.822
WHERE YOU CAN BUMP
INTO YOUR NEIGHBORS...

04:11.822 --> 04:13.824
WHETHER YOU WANT TO

04:13.824 --> 04:15.486
OR NOT.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.262
HI.

04:27.798 --> 04:30.040
BOY, I HOPE THEY HAVE DECAF
TODAY. (chuckles nervously)

04:30.040 --> 04:33.043
LAST TIME I WAS HERE, THEY WERE
OUT, SO I HAD TO HAVE REGULAR

04:33.043 --> 04:35.976
AND GOT SO WIRED,
I DIDN'T SLEEP ALL NIGHT.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.579
DOES THAT HAPPEN TO YOU?

04:38.579 --> 04:41.882
SERIOUSLY? YOU THINK I'M GONNA
MAKE SMALL TALK WITH YOU?

04:41.882 --> 04:43.584
(scoffs)

04:43.584 --> 04:45.586
EXCUSE ME?

04:45.586 --> 04:48.288
(lowers voice) I KNOW
YOU SLEPT WITH MY HUSBAND.

04:50.961 --> 04:52.363
OH.

04:52.363 --> 04:53.864
(normal voice) SO...

04:53.864 --> 04:56.967
I'M THINKIN' WE'RE PAST
THE CHIT-CHAT STAGE.

04:56.967 --> 05:01.071
(sighs)

05:01.071 --> 05:04.074
I AM SO SORRY.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.739
LET ME TELL YOU
HOW SHAME WORKS.

05:08.739 --> 05:11.041
WHEN YOU SEE THE WIFE
OF THE GUY YOU BANGED,

05:11.041 --> 05:12.913
YOU DON'T MAKE CONVERSATION.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.085
YOU DON'T EVEN SMILE
AND SAY HI.

05:15.085 --> 05:18.749
YOU AVERT YOUR GAZE
AND YOU BLUSH.

05:21.352 --> 05:23.023
NOD IF YOU UNDERSTAND.

05:24.795 --> 05:28.829
HERE'S YOUR MOCHA LATTE.
THAT'LL BE $3.50.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.961
OH. IT'S ON HER.

05:30.961 --> 05:33.003
SHE OWES ME.

05:39.069 --> 05:41.341
HEY.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.974
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE
FOR CLASS.

05:43.974 --> 05:46.076
DAD?

05:46.076 --> 05:49.620
ALL MY CLOTHES ARE TOO TIGHT.
I HAD TO BORROW YOURS.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.722
I WAS GONNA
WEAR THAT SHIRT TODAY.

05:51.722 --> 05:53.023
WELL, WHEN YOU'RE HIDING

05:53.023 --> 05:55.386
YOUR FOURTH MONTH OF PREGNANCY
WITH TWINS,

05:55.386 --> 05:57.928
YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:57.928 --> 06:01.131
I'M STILL ATTRACTED TO YOU
IN MEN'S CLOTHES. IS THAT WEIRD?

06:01.131 --> 06:04.665
(chuckles) ALL I NEED IS TO PULL
THIS OFF FOR TWO MORE DAYS.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.067
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD CARLOS
TWO MONTHS AGO.

06:07.067 --> 06:11.071
THERE'S NO WAY HE WON'T
BE FURIOUS WHEN HE FINDS OUT.

06:11.071 --> 06:14.405
TOM, I MAY BE WEARING
MEN'S CLOTHES,

06:14.405 --> 06:16.947
BUT I AM NOT AN IDIOT.
I'VE GOT THIS.

06:16.947 --> 06:19.810
TERRENCE HENDERSON AND I
ARE ABOUT TO CLOSE

06:19.810 --> 06:22.112
THE BIGGEST DEAL
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COMPANY.

06:22.112 --> 06:24.515
ONCE CARLOS SEES
HOW GREAT TERRENCE IS,

06:24.515 --> 06:26.517
HE'LL SEE THE WORK
CAN STILL GET DONE

06:26.517 --> 06:28.519
EVEN WHEN
I'M ON MATERNITY LEAVE.

06:28.519 --> 06:31.021
AND YOU'RE SURE THIS DEAL
IS GONNA CLOSE?

06:31.021 --> 06:32.523
NOPE. (laughs)

06:32.523 --> 06:35.025
THAT'S WHY WE NEED
TO KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED.

06:35.025 --> 06:37.127
OKAY, NOW WISH ME LUCK.

06:37.127 --> 06:39.430
GOOD LUCK.

06:39.430 --> 06:42.032
NOW COME HERE, MISTER.
I WANNA KISS YA.

06:43.434 --> 06:45.976
OKAY, NOW IT'S WEIRD.

06:54.144 --> 06:56.947
BLESS ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

06:56.947 --> 06:58.889
GO AHEAD, MY CHILD.

06:58.889 --> 07:00.951
WELL, I'VE BEEN HOMESCHOOLING
MY DAUGHTER,

07:00.951 --> 07:02.953
AND IT'S BEEN A LIVING HELL,

07:02.953 --> 07:05.456
SO I TRIED TO BRIBE SOMEONE
TO GET HER INTO CATHOLIC SCHOOL.

07:05.456 --> 07:07.828
MM, AND, UH, WHAT HAPPENED?

07:07.828 --> 07:10.000
WELL, YOU TELL ME.

07:11.462 --> 07:13.934
GABRIELLE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.936
OH, COME ON, PADRE.
YOU'RE THE HEAD OF ADMISSIONS.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.938
AND YOU'VE GOT
A GREAT SCHOOL HERE,

07:17.938 --> 07:19.940
BUT THERE'S
A 2-YEAR WAITING LIST!
 (sighs)

07:19.940 --> 07:21.842
PUT YOUR MONEY AWAY.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.915
IT'S YOUR MONEY. SLEEP WITH IT
FOR A WHILE. SEE HOW IT FEELS.

07:24.915 --> 07:26.747
NO!

07:26.747 --> 07:29.520
I WISH I COULD HELP,
BUT MY HANDS ARE TIED.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.523
OH, COME ON. I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO PART THE RED SEA.

07:32.523 --> 07:36.086
JUST FIND A SPOT FOR ONE KID
IN THE SECOND GRADE.
 LOOK, IF A STUDENT
WERE TO WITHDRAW,

07:36.086 --> 07:39.089
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO MOVE YOU
TO THE TOP OF THE WAITING LIST.

07:39.089 --> 07:40.761
(whispers) FANTASTIC!
 BUT FRANKLY,

07:40.761 --> 07:43.634
WE TEND TO FAVOR THOSE
WHO ARE MORE FAITHFUL.

07:43.634 --> 07:45.095
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

07:45.095 --> 07:49.069
WELL, I'VE NOTICED THAT YOU
DON'T COME TO MASS VERY OFTEN.

07:49.069 --> 07:53.003
(gasps)
OH! I HEAR YA, PADRE.

07:53.003 --> 07:55.706
YOU'RE OKAY WITH MONEY
AS LONG AS IT COMES

07:55.706 --> 07:58.749
COMES IN ONE OF THOSE LITTLE
WICKER BASKETS YOU PASS AROUND.

07:58.749 --> 08:00.911
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
 OF COURSE NOT.

08:00.911 --> 08:04.815
I REALIZE IT'S DARK IN HERE,
BUT JUST KNOW I'M WINKING BACK.

08:04.815 --> 08:06.987
(door opens)

08:09.520 --> 08:12.923
SO YOUR FIRST OPERA...
THAT'S QUITE A MILESTONE.

08:12.923 --> 08:15.225
THROW IN "LAST,"
AND IT'S TWO MILESTONES.

08:15.225 --> 08:18.829
OH, STOP. I SAW YOU TEAR UP
AT THE END OF ACT TWO.

08:18.829 --> 08:21.131
ONLY BECAUSE I REALIZED
THERE WAS AN ACT THREE.

08:21.131 --> 08:22.933
(chuckles)

08:22.933 --> 08:25.906
"MADAME BUTTERFLY"
IS PUCCINI'S MASTERPIECE.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.178
DIDN'T YOU ENJOY IT
JUST A LITTLE?

08:28.178 --> 08:32.111
(gasps) WHAT ABOUT THAT SCENE
WHEN BUTTERFLY TELLS HER CHILD

08:32.111 --> 08:35.586
NOT TO FEEL SORROW
FOR HER MOTHER'S DESERTION?

08:35.586 --> 08:37.988
DIDN'T THAT MAKE YOU FEEL
ANYTHING?

08:37.988 --> 08:40.650
ACTUALLY, THAT'S WHEN
YOU LEANED FORWARD,

08:40.650 --> 08:42.893
AND I SAW A LITTLE PEEK
OF YOUR BOOB.

08:42.893 --> 08:44.895
SO I GUESS
IT MADE ME FEEL HORNY.

08:44.895 --> 08:46.196
KARL, DON'T.

08:46.196 --> 08:48.999
COME ON. IT'S A DARK
PARKING STRUCTURE.

08:48.999 --> 08:51.231
PEOPLE ARE JUST GONNA THINK
I'M MUGGING YOU.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.233
WE AGREED
NO SEX FOR A MONTH.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.206
WE NEED TO FIND OUT IF WE CAN BE
TOGETHER IN A NONSEXUAL MANNER.

08:56.206 --> 08:58.068
I'M SERIOUS.

08:58.068 --> 09:00.210
CAN YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS
TO YOURSELF?

09:03.073 --> 09:04.675
CAN I?

09:04.675 --> 09:07.177
THANKS TO YOU,
IT'S MY ONLY CHOICE.

09:09.049 --> 09:13.323
(opera playing)

09:13.323 --> 09:15.325
(door opens)

09:17.287 --> 09:20.030
HEY, HOW WAS
YOUR BUSINESS DINNER?

09:20.030 --> 09:23.263
OH. UM... OUR BID WAS, UH,
TOO HIGH.

09:23.263 --> 09:26.296
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONNA
GO WITH ANOTHER CATERER.

09:26.296 --> 09:28.769
WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO?

09:28.769 --> 09:31.872
IT'S A NEW RECORDING
OF "MADAME BUTTERFLY."

09:31.872 --> 09:34.875
(woman singing in Italian)

09:54.224 --> 09:56.196
ISN'T THAT GLORIOUS?

10:02.973 --> 10:05.335
IT IS. I SHOULD...
GO TO BED, ORSON.

10:08.038 --> 10:10.741
GOOD NIGHT.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.125
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.127
YOU SIGN THE LEASE,
AND WE'LL POP THE CHAMPAGNE.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.030
THE FLORIDA BRANCH
IS OFFICIALLY A GO.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.663
(man) Terrific. So when we get
our branch manager?

10:32.663 --> 10:34.665
WE HAVE GOT SOMEBODY GREAT
LINED UP.

10:34.665 --> 10:37.237
WE JUST NEED TO FINALIZE
SOME THINGS.

10:37.237 --> 10:40.210
WE'LL GET BACK TO YA. THANKS.
 WHO DO WE HAVE LINED UP?

10:40.210 --> 10:42.342
NOBODY. THAT'S THE THING
WE NEED TO FINALIZE.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.975
OH.
 BUT TODAY, WE CELEBRATE.

10:44.975 --> 10:48.278
LYNETTE, YOU REALLY
HIT THIS ONE OUT OF THE PARK.
 I GOTTA GIVE CREDIT
WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.

10:48.278 --> 10:51.782
TERRENCE DID A LOT OF
THE HEAVY LIFTING ON THIS ONE,

10:51.782 --> 10:54.084
AND I DON'T CARE IF I EMBARRASS
HIM. THIS GUY IS A STAR.

10:54.084 --> 10:56.326
STRANGELY,
I'M NOT EMBARRASSED.

10:56.326 --> 10:58.028
(beep)
 (woman over intercom) Carlos,

10:58.028 --> 11:00.230
I didn't want
to interrupt your phone call,

11:00.230 --> 11:03.934
but your wife is here.
 UH, JUST TELL HER TO WAIT IN
MY OFFICE UNTIL WE'RE FINISHED.

11:03.934 --> 11:06.937
(Gabrielle over intercom)
You listen to me, Carlos Solis!

11:06.937 --> 11:10.100
I just came from St. Ursula's,
and we've got big trouble!

11:10.100 --> 11:11.842
Do not blow me off!
 (line disconnects)

11:11.842 --> 11:13.844
SO ACCORDING
TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH,

11:13.844 --> 11:15.675
WE'RE NOT HOLY ENOUGH.

11:15.675 --> 11:19.209
BUT I HAVE A FEELING A BIG,
FAT CHECK MIGHT SLAP ON A HALO.
 HOW BIG?

11:19.209 --> 11:21.211
WELL, SOMETHING THAT'LL
MAKE A PRIEST SAY

11:21.211 --> 11:23.213
"HOLY" AND "MOTHER"
IN THE SAME SENTENCE.

11:23.213 --> 11:27.217
THAT SHOULD GET HER TO
THE TOP OF THE WAITING LIST.
 I'M NOT GOING
TO WRITE A BIG CHECK

11:27.217 --> 11:29.790
ON THE CHANCE
THAT IT MIGHT GET HER IN.
 CARLOS!

11:29.790 --> 11:31.792
GABY, I CAN'T DO THIS NOW.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.794
YOU KNOW THE PROBLEMS
THAT I'M FACING

11:33.794 --> 11:36.096
TRYING TO GET THE NEW FLORIDA
OFFICE UP AND RUNNING.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.068
NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND...

11:38.068 --> 11:40.771
FINE.
CAN I TROUBLE YOU FOR $5?

11:40.771 --> 11:42.773
I'LL BUY JUANITA A HAIRNET

11:42.773 --> 11:46.206
AND PREPARE HER FOR A FUTURE
IN THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.908
(door opens)

11:47.908 --> 11:50.841
(Terrence and Lynette
speak indistinctly)

11:50.841 --> 11:52.412
HEY!

11:52.412 --> 11:54.915
HELLO... GENTLEMEN.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.387
WHAT? A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE WEARING THIS STYLE.

11:57.387 --> 12:00.450
WELL,
DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.

12:00.450 --> 12:02.823
HEY, UH, GABY, I HEARD
YOU MENTION ST. URSULA'S.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.825
IT IS WORTH THE HASSLE.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.157
OUR DAUGHTER MOLLY'S
IN THE SECOND GRADE.

12:07.157 --> 12:08.829
SHE LOVES IT THERE.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.832
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW MOLLY WAS
IN THE SAME GRADE AS JUANITA.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.105
YEAH.
 WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A SECOND?

12:19.169 --> 12:20.811
(door closes)

12:20.811 --> 12:22.813
HEY, THAT BRANCH IN FLORIDA?

12:22.813 --> 12:25.145
I THINK I FOUND OUR MAN.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.418
NO, NO, NO, YOU CAN'T
SEND TERRENCE TO FLORIDA.

12:28.418 --> 12:30.851
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.853
YOU TRAINED HIM WELL.
 EXACTLY.
YOU CAN'T SEND HIM AWAY.

12:32.853 --> 12:36.086
WHAT IF YOU NEED HIM HERE?
 WHY WOULD I? I'VE GOT YOU.

12:36.086 --> 12:38.058
BUT... (sighs)

12:38.058 --> 12:40.260
WHAT IF I WAS HIT BY A BUS

12:40.260 --> 12:44.234
AND I WAS... PUT ON BED REST
FOR, SAY, THREE MONTHS?

12:44.234 --> 12:47.237
WHO--WHO WOULD COVER FOR ME?

12:47.237 --> 12:49.499
(laughs)
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

12:49.499 --> 12:52.072
HEY!

12:52.072 --> 12:55.045
YOU JINXED IT. NOW FOR SURE SOME
VERSION OF THAT IS GONNA HAPPEN.

12:55.045 --> 12:57.908
LYNETTE, IT'S DONE. WE ARE
SENDING TERRENCE TO FLORIDA.

12:57.908 --> 13:00.981
OH, AND I REALLY LIKE THIS
NEW LOOK THAT YOU'VE GOT GOING,

13:00.981 --> 13:02.412
BUT CAREFUL--
ROBERTA IN ACCOUNTING ASKED

13:02.412 --> 13:05.485
IF I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE
TO GO BOWLING WITH HER.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.787
(sighs)

13:13.023 --> 13:15.425
(horn honks)

13:15.425 --> 13:17.097
HI, SUSAN!

13:17.097 --> 13:19.529
OH, GOD. UGH.

13:19.529 --> 13:21.531
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:21.531 --> 13:23.533
I WAS JUST HAVING LUNCH

13:23.533 --> 13:26.536
WITH SOME FRIENDS
WHO ARE NOT ON A CHAIN GANG.

13:26.536 --> 13:29.239
(singsong voice)
THOUGHT I'D STOP BY AND SAY HI.

13:29.239 --> 13:31.882
YOU MEAN STOP BY AND GLOAT.

13:31.882 --> 13:33.183
MAYBE A LITTLE.

13:33.183 --> 13:35.415
(singsong voice)
SO... HOW'S IT GOING?

13:35.415 --> 13:37.988
(normal voice)
MEETING ANYBODY?

13:37.988 --> 13:40.250
THEY SAY THE FRIENDS
YOU MAKE ON THE INSIDE...

13:40.250 --> 13:42.252
(singsong voice)
YOU'LL HAVE FOR LIFE.

13:42.252 --> 13:44.995
YES, KATHERINE,
THIS ALL SUCKS.

13:44.995 --> 13:46.897
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:46.897 --> 13:49.860
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I GO HOME TO MIKE...

13:49.860 --> 13:52.332
WHICH MEANS I WON.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.335
THAT'S BIG TALK FOR A WOMAN
STANDING IN AN ORANGE JUMPSUIT

13:55.335 --> 13:57.537
WITH BLISTERS ON HER FEET.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.539
WELL, MIKE WILL RUB THEM
WHEN I GO HOME.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.842
AND FOR THE RECORD,
I TOTALLY MAKE THIS WORK.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.845
THE FACT THAT YOU THINK
YOU LOOK GOOD IN ORANGE

14:05.845 --> 14:08.148
SHOWS I'M NOT DEALING
WITH A RATIONAL PERSON.

14:08.148 --> 14:11.321
OH, BY THE WAY...
YOU MISSED SOMETHING.

14:11.321 --> 14:14.885
NO, I DIDN'T.
 YEAH, YOU DID.

14:16.286 --> 14:19.429
BYE-BYE.

14:19.429 --> 14:22.232
HEY! COME BACK HERE!

14:22.232 --> 14:23.433
(scoffs)

14:23.433 --> 14:26.997
SHE LITTERED! SHOOT HER!
 WHAT A MORON.

14:26.997 --> 14:29.239
I WISH I'D CAUGHT
HER LICENSE PLATE NUMBER.

14:29.239 --> 14:31.071
SHE'D BE SORRY.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.073
REALLY?

14:33.073 --> 14:36.306
WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE COULD YOU DO
WITH HER HOME ADDRESS?

14:45.485 --> 14:48.288
YOU MISSED SOMETHING.

15:00.971 --> 15:03.373
(speaking inaudibly)

15:03.373 --> 15:05.375
DID YOU GET 'EM ALL?

15:05.375 --> 15:07.077
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO EAT IT,
NOT WEAR IT.

15:07.077 --> 15:09.239
WELL, THEY CALL IT CRUMB CAKE
FOR A REASON. COME ON.

15:09.239 --> 15:12.182
EMILY, CAN YOU STEAM ME
SOME 2% MILK?

15:13.683 --> 15:16.086
(door bells jingle)

15:16.086 --> 15:17.187
(indistinct conversations)

15:17.187 --> 15:19.089
HEY.

15:19.089 --> 15:21.251
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I'M FIVE MINUTES LATE?

15:21.251 --> 15:23.223
WHAT?

15:23.223 --> 15:26.056
THE WAITRESS WITH THE HANDS.

15:26.056 --> 15:28.959
SHE WAS BRUSHING CRUMBS
OFF MY SHIRT.

15:28.959 --> 15:32.332
WHAT, THE ONES JULIE MISSED?
 OH, GOD.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.605
IS THIS HOW IT'S GONNA BE
EVERY TIME I TALK TO A WOMAN?

15:35.605 --> 15:38.308
YEAH, PROBABLY.

15:38.308 --> 15:40.270
ANGE, I'M SORRY.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.442
I-I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I CAN SAY IT.

15:42.442 --> 15:46.346
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.
I'LL DO COUPLES THERAPY.

15:49.279 --> 15:50.380
GREAT IDEA.

15:50.380 --> 15:52.382
LET'S TELL SOMEBODY
ALL OUR SECRETS,

15:52.382 --> 15:56.356
AND THEN WHEN WE'RE CURED,
WE CAN KILL HIM.
 LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT.

16:01.231 --> 16:04.234
I WANT YOU TO BE THE GUY
YOU USED TO BE,

16:04.234 --> 16:07.237
THE GUY WHO SAVED MY LIFE,
NOT THE GUY WHO DESTROYED IT.

16:09.299 --> 16:11.341
HOW WE DOING HERE?

16:14.004 --> 16:16.276
NEVER BEEN BETTER,

16:18.178 --> 16:19.309
HEY!
 HI!

16:19.309 --> 16:21.181
COME ON IN!
 YEAH!

16:21.181 --> 16:24.214
THIS IS SO NICE OF YOU. YEAH.
 OH, NO.

16:24.214 --> 16:26.216
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
THAT ONE OF MY ASSOCIATES

16:26.216 --> 16:29.219
GETS A BIG PROMOTION.
 THANK YOU.

16:29.219 --> 16:32.222
TOM, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE CRYSTAL
IN THE DEN AND GET COMFORTABLE

16:32.222 --> 16:35.225
WHILE I STEAL THIS GUY
TO HELP ME MAKE COCKTAILS?

16:35.225 --> 16:37.297
COME ON. RIGHT THIS WAY.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.433
SO HOW EXCITED ARE YOU?
MIAMI!

16:43.433 --> 16:47.006
PRETTY JAZZED.
IT'S AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.008
I THINK IT'S GREAT

16:49.008 --> 16:52.712
HOW YOU'RE CONCENTRATING
ON THE UPSIDE OF THIS.
 THERE'S A DOWNSIDE?

16:52.712 --> 16:55.285
NO, NOT REALLY.
FORGET I MENTIONED IT.

16:57.147 --> 17:00.220
(glasses clink)
 IT'S JUST...

17:00.220 --> 17:02.222
DO YOU REMEMBER TIM BAKER

17:02.222 --> 17:05.095
WHO WAS SENT TO HEAD UP
OUR CHICAGO OFFICE?

17:05.095 --> 17:06.526
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.229
(whispers) EXACTLY.

17:09.229 --> 17:12.262
SO... YOU ARE MOVING
TO FLORIDA.

17:12.262 --> 17:14.233
WOW! PECAN?

17:14.233 --> 17:17.107
OH, NO, THANKS. I'M ON A DIET.
 OH.

17:17.107 --> 17:19.709
AW, YEAH, I CAN'T WAIT.
(singsongy) NO MORE WINTER.

17:19.709 --> 17:21.611
YEP, JUST HEAT
AND HURRICANES.

17:21.611 --> 17:24.614
(normal voice) OH, I'M WILLING
TO PUT UP WITH THAT.

17:24.614 --> 17:27.046
MIAMI HAS SO MANY OTHER THINGS
TO OFFER.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.520
OH, IT CERTAINLY MUST TO ATTRACT
ALL THOSE COLOMBIAN DRUG LORDS.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.523
THE CHICAGO BRANCH WAS
A LITTLE SLOW OUT OF THE GATE.

17:33.523 --> 17:37.427
CORPORATE FREAKED
AND MADE TIM THE SCAPEGOAT.
 WHERE IS HE NOW?

17:37.427 --> 17:39.729
HE'S IN PLASTICS...
OR PAPER,

17:39.729 --> 17:43.193
DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANT
YOUR GROCERIES IN. WINE?

17:43.193 --> 17:45.365
AND WHEN THEY CUT
INTO THE ALLIGATOR'S STOMACH,

17:45.365 --> 17:48.298
NOT ONLY WAS THE GUY'S ARM
STILL INTACT,

17:48.298 --> 17:51.441
BUT IT WAS STILL HOLDING
HIS GOLF CLUB.

17:51.441 --> 17:54.444
I THINK HE WOULD'VE BEEN FINE
IF HIS WIFE HADN'T LEFT HIM.

17:54.444 --> 17:56.446
THAT LED DIRECTLY
TO THE ALCOHOLISM,

17:56.446 --> 17:58.448
WHICH PROBABLY
HAD SOMETHING TO DO

17:58.448 --> 18:00.510
WITH HIM THREATENING
THE PRESIDENT.

18:00.510 --> 18:03.353
BOY, IS THAT A BITCH
ON THE OLD RéSUMé.

18:03.353 --> 18:05.355
(exhales deeply)

18:05.355 --> 18:07.317
THAT HUMIDITY... YOUR HAIR?

18:07.317 --> 18:09.619
I THINK IT'S A RECIPE
FOR COTTON CANDY.

18:11.391 --> 18:14.194
HERE WE GO, EVERYBODY.
WE'VE GOT THE WINE.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.866
I WOULD LIKE
TO PROPOSE A TOAST.

18:16.866 --> 18:19.299
TO TERRENCE AND CRYSTAL,

18:19.299 --> 18:22.472
MAY MIAMI BE EVERYTHING
YOU THINK IT WILL.

18:22.472 --> 18:25.135
HEAR, HEAR.
 (clink)

18:28.378 --> 18:31.441
(woman singing in Italian)
 KNOCK KNOCK. ANYBODY HOME?

18:31.441 --> 18:33.613
COME ON IN, ANGIE.

18:36.216 --> 18:39.219
THIS IS PRETTY.
WHAT IS IT?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.391
IT'S FROM THE OPERA
"MADAME BUTTERFLY."

18:41.391 --> 18:44.354
SHE SOUNDS SO SAD.

18:44.354 --> 18:47.727
WELL, ACTUALLY, IN THIS ARIA,
BUTTERFLY IS HOPEFUL

18:47.727 --> 18:50.660
THAT ONE DAY HER LOVER
WILL RETURN TO HER.

18:50.660 --> 18:53.263
OH. DOES HE?

18:53.263 --> 18:54.434
NO.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.367
BECAUSE OF HIS ABANDONMENT,

18:57.367 --> 18:58.838
SHE KILLS HERSELF.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.610
OH.

19:00.610 --> 19:03.643
YOU EVER SEE "AVENUE Q"?
THE MUSICAL WITH THE PUPPETS?

19:03.643 --> 19:06.816
NOW THAT'S GOOD THEATER.

19:06.816 --> 19:08.818
(sighs)
 (turns off stereo)

19:08.818 --> 19:11.681
BREE'S NOT HERE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

19:11.681 --> 19:14.153
WELL, I NEED TO TALK TO HER
ABOUT SOME WORK STUFF.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.155
WHERE IS SHE?
 SHE'S OUT.

19:18.428 --> 19:22.292
THAT'S GENERALLY
WHERE BREE IS THESE DAYS.

19:22.292 --> 19:24.594
OUT.

19:24.594 --> 19:26.736
SHE'S MEETING
WITH A PROSPECTIVE CLIENT,

19:26.736 --> 19:29.299
SO SHE SAYS.

19:29.299 --> 19:31.601
SHE'S HAD FOUR CLIENT MEETINGS
THIS WEEK,

19:31.601 --> 19:35.375
AND NOT ONE HAS RESULTED
IN A BOOKING.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.377
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

19:37.377 --> 19:40.880
(sighs) IT'S A ROUGH ECONOMY.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.284
SEE, I THINK
SHE'S TAKEN A LOVER.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.357
(laughing)

19:47.357 --> 19:49.419
WHAT? OH, COME ON.

19:49.419 --> 19:50.920
NO WAY.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.763
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?
 AN AFFAIR?

19:53.763 --> 19:57.297
OH, PLEASE, THE WOMAN MAKES
HER OWN CROUTONS.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.799
PERHAPS.

20:02.232 --> 20:05.875
ANGIE, I HAVE TO GO AWAY
ON A GOLF WEEKEND.

20:05.875 --> 20:07.537
WHILE I'M GONE,

20:07.537 --> 20:10.580
COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND KEEP AN EYE ON BREE?

20:10.580 --> 20:13.313
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
 JUST OBSERVE HER.

20:13.313 --> 20:17.287
DOES SHE COME HOME AT NIGHT?
IS ANYONE WITH HER?

20:17.287 --> 20:20.550
LOOK, IF YOU WANNA BE PARANOID,
GO AHEAD. IT'S A FREE COUNTRY.

20:20.550 --> 20:23.553
BUT I AM NOT GONNA
SPY ON YOUR WIFE FOR YOU.

20:23.553 --> 20:25.595
(whispers) YES.

20:25.595 --> 20:28.998
(normal voice) I SUPPOSE
THAT'S FOR THE BEST.

20:28.998 --> 20:32.001
I MEAN, IF I DID FIND OUT
SHE WAS BETRAYING ME,

20:32.001 --> 20:34.003
I'D PROBABLY
DO SOMETHING STUPID.

20:34.003 --> 20:36.005
(turns on stereo)

20:36.005 --> 20:40.510
♪♪♪

20:43.413 --> 20:45.415
(speeding vehicle approaching)

20:47.016 --> 20:50.680
(coughing and gagging)

20:50.680 --> 20:53.323
(gasping)

20:53.323 --> 20:55.755
(coughing)

20:55.755 --> 20:57.757
(sobbing)

20:57.757 --> 21:00.830
OH, TOUGHEN UP.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE DUST.

21:00.830 --> 21:02.632
OH!

21:02.632 --> 21:06.436
(crying softly)

21:06.436 --> 21:08.438
LOOK, I HAVE TO CLEAN
THAT AREA.

21:08.438 --> 21:11.341
WOULD YOU MIND HAVING
YOUR BREAKDOWN SOMEPLACE ELSE?

21:11.341 --> 21:13.373
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE, OKAY?

21:13.373 --> 21:15.645
YOU WON, I LOST.
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

21:15.645 --> 21:17.877
WHAT?

21:17.877 --> 21:20.410
WHEN YOU'RE SITTING
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD

21:20.410 --> 21:22.552
PICKING UP STYROFOAM
AND WADS OF GUM,

21:22.552 --> 21:24.984
IT'S TIME TO ADMIT DEFEAT.

21:24.984 --> 21:28.758
THE MAN I LOVE CHOSE YOU.
IT'S OVER.

21:28.758 --> 21:32.422
ARE YOU MESSING WITH ME?

21:32.422 --> 21:34.063
NO.

21:34.063 --> 21:35.825
I'M BEING HONEST.

21:35.825 --> 21:37.627
(sighs)

21:37.627 --> 21:40.299
(voice breaks) WHY HAS THIS
BEEN SO HARD ON ME?

21:43.333 --> 21:44.834
WELL...

21:47.306 --> 21:48.978
YOU LOVED HIM.

21:48.978 --> 21:51.611
I DID.

21:51.611 --> 21:54.344
I REALLY DID.
AND NOW HE'S GONE.

21:54.344 --> 21:57.417
KATHERINE, YOU'RE AN ATTRACTIVE,
INTELLIGENT WOMAN.

21:57.417 --> 22:00.350
YOU'RE GONNA MEET OTHER GUYS.

22:00.350 --> 22:02.321
NOT LIKE MIKE.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.554
WE CONNECTED
ON SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS...

22:04.554 --> 22:05.925
(sniffles)

22:05.925 --> 22:07.457
INTELLECTUALLY,

22:07.457 --> 22:09.399
EMOTIONALLY,

22:09.399 --> 22:11.100
SEXUALLY.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.462
(exhales deeply)

22:12.462 --> 22:15.905
OH, I'VE NEVER FELT
SUCH PASSION.

22:15.905 --> 22:18.408
WHERE AM I GONNA FIND
ANOTHER GUY

22:18.408 --> 22:21.841
WHO'LL MAKE LOVE TO ME
FIVE TIMES IN ONE DAY? (sobs)

22:25.415 --> 22:27.377
THAT'S A LIE.

22:27.377 --> 22:28.778
NO, IT'S NOT.

22:28.778 --> 22:30.480
FIVE TIMES?

22:30.480 --> 22:32.351
SUSAN, COME ON.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.584
DON'T TELL ME THAT
YOU AND MIKE HAVE NEVER...

22:37.787 --> 22:41.060
OH.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.893
HMM. (sniffles)

22:46.065 --> 22:48.598
MAYBE I DIDN'T LOSE
AFTER ALL.

22:58.678 --> 23:01.451
MMM. MMM.

23:01.451 --> 23:03.513
AHH.
 (sighs)

23:03.513 --> 23:04.514
OH.

23:04.514 --> 23:05.985
GOD.
 (laughs)

23:05.985 --> 23:08.988
REMIND ME TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU
WANT FOR BREAKFAST MORE OFTEN.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.990
BEATS A BOWL OF OATMEAL,
DOESN'T IT?

23:10.990 --> 23:12.992
YOU KIDDING?
THAT BEAT A WAFFLE.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.994
LISTEN, I HAVE A CRAZY IDEA.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.497
WHY DON'T WE BOTH
CALL IN SICK

23:17.497 --> 23:19.999
AND SPEND THE DAY IN BED
NAKED TOGETHER?

23:19.999 --> 23:22.001
(giggles)
DID I MENTION NAKED?

23:22.001 --> 23:24.003
YOU WANNA GO FOR SECONDS?
 MM-HMM.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.005
OH, WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?
 MMM.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.508
EVEN ON MY BIRTHDAY
YOU TOLD ME TO HURRY UP

23:28.508 --> 23:30.510
BECAUSE "THE BACHELOR" WAS ON.

23:30.510 --> 23:33.483
WELL... CAN'T A WIFE JUST WANT
TO SPEND TIME WITH HER HUSBAND?

23:33.483 --> 23:36.986
WELL, YEAH. IT'S JUST
THAT YOUR TIMING'S BAD.

23:36.986 --> 23:38.988
GOTTA FINISH
MR. HINKLE'S SHOWER.

23:38.988 --> 23:40.990
I PROMISED HIM
I'D BE THERE YESTERDAY.

23:40.990 --> 23:42.652
I'M SERIOUS.
 (giggles)

23:42.652 --> 23:45.595
THE OLD MAN HASN'T
HAD A SHOWER IN THREE DAYS.

23:45.595 --> 23:47.597
AND THAT'S A LONG TIME...
(moans)
 MM-HMM.

23:47.597 --> 23:49.459
FOR AN OLD MAN...

23:49.459 --> 23:50.760
MM-HMM.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.762
TO NOT TAKE A SHOWER.

23:52.762 --> 23:53.933
MMM.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.436
OH, THE HELL WITH IT.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.470
HE SURVIVED WORLD WAR II.
HE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.
 OH!

24:03.172 --> 24:07.617
(singsongy) FATHER CROWLEY, HI.
THIS IS FOR YOU.

24:07.617 --> 24:10.119
(normal voice) I THOUGHT
I'D CATCH UP ON MY GIVING

24:10.119 --> 24:12.522
TO MY FAVORITE PARISH.

24:12.522 --> 24:14.884
WOW. I CERTAINLY
DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.

24:14.884 --> 24:18.488
WELL, DO WITH IT WHAT YOU WILL--
BUY A NEW PIPE ORGAN,

24:18.488 --> 24:20.560
HELP THE NEEDY,

24:20.560 --> 24:23.633
TAKE A TRIP TO TAHITI.
I REALLY DON'T CARE.

24:23.633 --> 24:24.964
OH, LISTEN.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.767
I DON'T KNOW WHICH NUN
YOU'RE GONNA PUT MY KID WITH,

24:27.767 --> 24:29.769
BUT MAKE SURE SHE'S HAD
A TETANUS SHOT.

24:29.769 --> 24:33.202
JUANITA'S A BITER.
 UH, GABRIELLE, I THINK
YOU'RE JUMPING THE GUN HERE.

24:33.202 --> 24:35.204
WHY? A SPOT OPENED UP.

24:35.204 --> 24:37.877
MOLLY HENDERSON
IS MOVING TO FLORIDA, RIGHT?
 WELL, SHE WAS.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.879
HER FATHER WAS GOING
TO TAKE A NEW JOB,

24:39.879 --> 24:42.481
BUT HE DECIDED AGAINST IT.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.154
WHAT? NO!
NO, THIS CAN'T BE!

24:45.154 --> 24:47.657
I'M AFRAID IT IS.
 (groans)

24:47.657 --> 24:51.220
ANYWAY, H-HOW DID YOU
EVEN KNOW ABOUT THIS?

24:51.220 --> 24:53.523
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
IN CONFESSION.

24:53.523 --> 24:55.024
HAVE FAITH, GABRIELLE.

24:55.024 --> 24:58.027
WHEN GOD CLOSES A DOOR,
HE OPENS A WINDOW.

24:59.969 --> 25:03.172
THANK YOU, FATHER CROWLEY.

25:08.037 --> 25:09.539
(sighs)

25:13.813 --> 25:15.514
(door closes)

25:15.514 --> 25:18.718
(singsongy) HEY. I GOT THE STUFF
FOR THE MUSHROOM TARTS.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.190
(normal voice)
HOW'S THAT CAKE COMING ALONG?

25:21.190 --> 25:24.694
JUST WHEN I THINK I CAN'T
TOP MYSELF, I DO. HMM.

25:24.694 --> 25:26.525
HMM. HOW ABOUT THAT?

25:26.525 --> 25:29.699
OH, BY THE WAY, ORSON THINKS
YOU'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

25:32.932 --> 25:35.765
(chuckles nervously)
HE THINKS WHAT NOW?

25:35.765 --> 25:37.767
HE THINKS
YOU'RE STEPPIN' OUT.

25:37.767 --> 25:40.269
BUT I TOLD HIM
THERE IS NO WAY

25:40.269 --> 25:43.272
BREE VAN DE KAMP IS WHORING
IT UP IN SOME SLEAZY MOTEL.

25:43.272 --> 25:45.274
UH, THANK YOU FOR THAT.

25:45.274 --> 25:47.276
SORRY TO SPRING IT ON YOU
LIKE THAT.

25:47.276 --> 25:49.879
I JUST FELT YOU SHOULD KNOW
WHAT HE WAS SAYING.

25:49.879 --> 25:51.651
WELL, I APPRECIATE IT.

25:51.651 --> 25:54.954
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HE WOULD GO TO YOU.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.186
WELL, HE WAS DRINKING A LOT.

25:57.186 --> 25:59.889
ALSO, HE ASKED ME
IF I WOULD SPY ON YOU.

26:03.292 --> 26:06.095
RELAX, BREE.

26:06.095 --> 26:08.567
OBVIOUSLY I SAID NO.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.569
AND I APPRECIATE THAT, TOO.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.902
WOULD YOU MIND, UM,
CLEANING THIS UP FOR ME?

26:12.902 --> 26:16.275
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE DONE
TOPPING YOURSELF?

26:16.275 --> 26:19.278
(chuckles nervously)

26:21.110 --> 26:24.153
THIS IS SERIOUS, KARL.
HE ASKED ANGIE TO SPY ON ME.

26:24.153 --> 26:27.356
AND GOD KNOWS WHO ELSE
HE HAS WATCHING ME.

26:27.356 --> 26:30.359
(sighs) I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN

26:30.359 --> 26:32.862
UNTIL AFTER
YOU'VE GOTTEN ME A DIVORCE.

26:32.862 --> 26:36.195
DON'T ASK ME HOW.
 YOU'RE THE LAWYER.

26:41.270 --> 26:42.872
(door opens)

26:42.872 --> 26:46.005
HEY. AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE AT SCHOOL?

26:46.005 --> 26:48.307
YOU NEVER COME HOME
FOR LUNCH.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.309
I THOUGHT I'D TRY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.311
MMM.
 HEY, SINCE WE'RE BOTH HOME,

26:52.311 --> 26:54.684
WHY DON'T WE GO UPSTAIRS
AND MAKE LOVE?

26:54.684 --> 26:56.686
WHAT, SERIOUSLY?
YOU WANT TO DO IT AGAIN?

26:56.686 --> 26:58.818
W--I JUST GOT A SUB
FROM MARTINELLI'S.

26:58.818 --> 27:01.250
MIKE, I AM OFFERING YOU
A NOONER.

27:01.250 --> 27:04.393
DROP YOUR PANTS
AND GET UPSTAIRS.
 CAN I BRING MY SANDWICH?

27:04.393 --> 27:06.656
YES. BRING IT. GRAB A PICKLE.
I DON'T CARE.

27:06.656 --> 27:08.658
YOU'RE THE BEST WIFE EVER.

27:08.658 --> 27:11.761
COME ON!
 CAN I TURN ON
"THE THREE STOOGES," TOO?

27:14.063 --> 27:15.364
(knock on door)

27:15.364 --> 27:17.867
LYNETTE, IT'S GABY!

27:20.069 --> 27:22.241
IN A MINUTE.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.143
UM...

27:24.143 --> 27:26.045
(knock on door)

27:26.045 --> 27:27.216
(sighs)

27:29.879 --> 27:31.250
HEY, GABY.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.352
HEY, NANOOK.
WHY YOU WEARING A PARKA?

27:33.352 --> 27:36.686
BECAUSE... FUR IS MURDER.
WHAT'S UP?

27:38.227 --> 27:40.229
I-I TALKED TO CRYSTAL HENDERSON,

27:40.229 --> 27:43.232
AND SHE SAID YOU TALKED TERRENCE
OUT OF GOING TO MIAMI.

27:43.232 --> 27:45.194
IS THAT TRUE?
 I DIDN'T TALK HIM OUT OF IT.

27:45.194 --> 27:50.039
I MERELY POINTED OUT
THE PROS AND CONS.
 WELL, APPARENTLY, THE CONS WON.

27:50.039 --> 27:52.271
YOU'VE GOTTA UNTALK HIM
OUT OF IT.

27:52.271 --> 27:56.245
I NEED HIM OUT OF THIS STATE.
 WHY? (gasps)
ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH HIM?

27:56.245 --> 27:58.247
NO! TRUTH IS,
IF HE DOESN'T GO,

27:58.247 --> 28:01.210
JUANITA CAN'T TAKE
HIS KID'S SPOT AT ST. URSULA'S.

28:01.210 --> 28:02.812
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

28:02.812 --> 28:04.814
YOU WANT THIS GUY
TO UPROOT HIS ENTIRE LIFE

28:04.814 --> 28:08.317
JUST SO YOU CAN GET OUT
OF HOMESCHOOLING YOUR DAUGHTER?
 YEAH, YEAH, SELFISH GABY.

28:08.317 --> 28:12.121
SAME OLD SONG.
JOIN IN IF YOU KNOW THE WORDS.
 WELL, SORRY, GABY,
I NEED TERRENCE HERE.

28:12.121 --> 28:13.422
WHY? (gasps)

28:13.422 --> 28:16.265
(whispers)
ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH HIM?

28:16.265 --> 28:18.968
NO! I JUST NEED HIM HERE.

28:18.968 --> 28:20.970
EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND,

28:20.970 --> 28:23.402
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO
MAKE MY LIFE MORE COMPLICATED.

28:23.402 --> 28:26.035
(voice breaks) WHY CAN'T
EVERYONE JUST LET IT GO?

28:26.035 --> 28:27.937
(normal voice)
HEY, I'M SORRY.

28:27.937 --> 28:30.009
COME HERE.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.981
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

28:31.981 --> 28:34.944
(chuckles) WHY ARE YOU
GETTING SO UPSET?

28:34.944 --> 28:36.345
OH!

28:36.345 --> 28:38.047
WHAT WAS THAT?

28:38.047 --> 28:39.348
WHAT WAS WHAT?

28:41.490 --> 28:44.353
YOUR STOMACH JUST KICKED ME.

28:44.353 --> 28:46.455
OPEN THE PARKA.
 I'D RATHER NOT.

28:46.455 --> 28:48.197
OPEN IT!

28:50.830 --> 28:51.961
(gasps)

28:51.961 --> 28:53.302
YOU'RE PREGNANT?

28:53.302 --> 28:55.304
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?!

28:55.304 --> 28:56.966
BECAUSE...

28:56.966 --> 28:58.968
I KNEW YOU'D TELL CARLOS.

28:58.968 --> 29:02.912
YEAH, SO I TELL CARLOS.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH...

29:02.912 --> 29:05.945
OH, NO.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.017
WHEN CARLOS OFFERED YOU
THAT PROMOTION,

29:08.017 --> 29:10.019
YOU KNEW YOU WERE PREGNANT

29:10.019 --> 29:12.852
AND YOU KNEW YOU'D
BE LEAVING HIM IN THE LURCH?
 GABY--

29:12.852 --> 29:14.854
CARLOS JUST GOT
THIS COMPANY!

29:14.854 --> 29:17.326
HE BROUGHT IN PEOPLE
HE COULD DEPEND ON,

29:17.326 --> 29:20.329
AND HE THOUGHT
HE COULD DEPEND ON YOU!
 I DIDN'T TELL CARLOS

29:20.329 --> 29:22.761
BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS
THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB,

29:22.761 --> 29:25.764
AND I WANTED TO PROVE IT.
 WELL, YOU CERTAINLY PROVED
SOMETHING.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.297
GABY, WAIT!
PLEASE DON'T TELL CARLOS.

29:28.297 --> 29:30.800
I THINK HE SHOULD HEAR IT
FROM ME.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.142
YEAH. BETTER LATE THAN NEVER,
RIGHT?

29:33.142 --> 29:36.075
(door closes)

29:46.015 --> 29:48.157
(sighs)

29:48.157 --> 29:49.819
SUSAN, I'M HOME!

29:49.819 --> 29:51.290
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

29:51.290 --> 29:53.162
UP HERE!

29:58.067 --> 30:00.369
HELLO, LOVER.

30:00.369 --> 30:02.972
OH, GOD.

30:02.972 --> 30:05.134
SUSAN, I CAN'T.

30:05.134 --> 30:07.136
I-I-I GOT NOTHING LEFT.

30:07.136 --> 30:09.138
I HIT MY HAND
WITH A WRENCH TODAY,

30:09.138 --> 30:11.280
AND WHEN I CRIED,
ONLY DUST CAME OUT.

30:11.280 --> 30:12.982
YOU CRIED?

30:12.982 --> 30:15.384
THAT IS SO SEXY.

30:15.384 --> 30:17.386
MM. WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU?

30:17.386 --> 30:20.289
IT'S LIKE YOU JUST
GOT OUT OF PRISON.

30:20.289 --> 30:22.421
IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH
A HUSBAND AND WIFE HAVING SEX?

30:22.421 --> 30:24.453
WE HAVE A PASSIONATE
RELATIONSHIP, DON'T WE?

30:24.453 --> 30:26.455
WELL, OF COURSE WE DO.

30:26.455 --> 30:29.428
IT'S JUST, I WAS HOPING
T-TONIGHT WE COULD...

30:29.428 --> 30:30.399
CUDDLE.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.433
CUDDLE?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.605
AM I THAT REPULSIVE TO YOU?

30:36.605 --> 30:38.567
WHAT?

30:38.567 --> 30:40.870
IT'S OKAY, MIKE.
YOU CAN SAY IT.

30:40.870 --> 30:42.872
(voice breaks)
I'M A LOUSY LAY.

30:42.872 --> 30:45.374
SUSAN, WE HAD SEX
THREE TIMES TODAY.

30:45.374 --> 30:48.147
ALL RIGHT,
I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.279
IT'S NOT YOU.
IT'S BASIC BIOLOGY.

30:50.279 --> 30:52.922
REALLY? BIOLOGY?

30:52.922 --> 30:56.285
WELL,
HERE IS SOME BASIC MATH.

30:56.285 --> 30:58.327
(blows)

30:58.327 --> 31:01.390
YOU HAD SEX WITH KATHERINE
 FIVE TIMES IN ONE DAY

31:01.390 --> 31:03.062
AND ME THREE.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.533
FIVE MINUS THREE EQUALS

31:04.533 --> 31:08.337
KATHERINE TURNS YOU ON,
AND SEX WITH ME IS A CHORE.

31:08.337 --> 31:11.340
YOU AND KATHERINE
ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT THIS?

31:11.340 --> 31:14.373
MORE LIKE SHE RUBBED IT
IN MY FACE.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.905
OKAY.

31:15.905 --> 31:18.908
LOOK, THE ONLY REASON THAT
THAT "RECORD" EVER HAPPENED

31:18.908 --> 31:22.011
WAS WE GOT SNOWED IN
DURING A SKI TRIP.

31:22.011 --> 31:26.315
AND WE HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

31:26.315 --> 31:29.888
SEX WAS ALL WE EVER HAD!

31:29.888 --> 31:31.420
UHH!

31:33.192 --> 31:35.194
(sighs)

31:35.194 --> 31:36.365
(huffs)

31:36.365 --> 31:38.467
DON'T YOU GET IT?

31:38.467 --> 31:40.970
THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE
TO THE RELATIONSHIP.

31:40.970 --> 31:43.302
BUT YOU AND I--
WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING.

31:43.302 --> 31:47.636
WE HAVE A RICH, FULL LIFE
TOGETHER.

31:47.636 --> 31:50.439
WE COULD FINISH
EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES.

31:52.341 --> 31:54.543
OH, MIKE, I--

31:54.543 --> 31:57.416
"I'VE BEEN SO FOOLISH."

31:57.416 --> 32:00.249
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WERE GONNA SAY?

32:00.249 --> 32:02.551
AND?

32:02.551 --> 32:05.324
YOU WANNA CUDDLE.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.997
I WAS GONNA SAY
"THE BACHELOR" IS ON.

32:07.997 --> 32:09.058
(chuckles)

32:09.058 --> 32:12.231
BUT CUDDLING'S GOOD, TOO.

32:14.403 --> 32:16.535
(door creaks)

32:16.535 --> 32:20.439
KARL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
SOMEONE COULD SEE YOU!

32:20.439 --> 32:23.442
YEAH, ESPECIALLY IF YOU LEAVE ME
STANDING ON YOUR DOORSTEP.

32:26.375 --> 32:27.716
(door closes)

32:27.716 --> 32:30.449
RELAX.
I PARKED TWO BLOCKS AWAY.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.621
I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOUR TAKING RISKS LIKE THIS.

32:32.621 --> 32:35.084
IF ORSON FIND OUT ABOUT--
 AH, AH, AH, AH.

32:35.084 --> 32:37.356
YOU WON'T HAVE THAT
TO WORRY ABOUT MUCH LONGER.

32:37.356 --> 32:40.259
I FOUND A WAY TO SPRING YOU
FROM THIS MARRIAGE!

32:47.436 --> 32:51.240
ORSON'S STILL ON PAROLE,
RIGHT?

32:51.240 --> 32:53.372
FOR ANOTHER YEAR. WHY?

32:53.372 --> 32:56.075
IF HE VIOLATES PAROLE
BY, FOR INSTANCE,

32:56.075 --> 32:59.748
ASSOCIATING WITH A KNOWN FELON,
THEY CAN REVOKE IT.

32:59.748 --> 33:03.382
AND SEND HIM BACK TO JAIL.
 ALL WE NEED TO DO

33:03.382 --> 33:05.484
IS GET SOME EX-CON
IN A ROOM WITH ORSON,

33:05.484 --> 33:07.686
TAKE SOME PICTURES, AND BAM!

33:07.686 --> 33:10.219
HE CAN'T TOUCH YOU
BECAUSE IF HE DOES,

33:10.219 --> 33:12.361
THE PAROLE OFFICER
WILL GET THE PICTURES,

33:12.361 --> 33:15.194
AND IT'S BYE-BYE, ORSON.

33:15.194 --> 33:18.397
KARL, THAT'S PERFECT! AND THEN
HE'LL HAVE TO LET ME GO.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.499
AHH. I THINK SOMEONE
DESERVES A KISS.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.031
(giggles)

33:22.031 --> 33:23.202
MM!

33:23.202 --> 33:25.334
KARL, WE AGREED.

33:25.334 --> 33:27.336
BREE, FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER,

33:27.336 --> 33:29.408
YOUR HUSBAND IS OUT OF TOWN.

33:29.408 --> 33:32.341
DO WE REALLY WANT
TO LET THAT GO TO WASTE?

33:49.458 --> 33:51.500
MMM.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.402
(moans)

33:56.505 --> 33:58.707
(car approaches)

34:09.478 --> 34:12.281
(scoffs)

34:12.281 --> 34:15.454
(dialing)

34:23.462 --> 34:26.495
COME ON. COME ON!

34:26.495 --> 34:29.138
(ring)
 MMM. MMM.

34:29.138 --> 34:31.469
DO NOT ANSWER THAT.
 (ring)

34:31.469 --> 34:34.373
This is Bree.
Please leave a message.

34:34.373 --> 34:35.674
OH, DAMN IT!
 (dials)

34:40.478 --> 34:42.811
MMM!
 (ring)

34:42.811 --> 34:44.483
(sighs)
 (grunts)

34:44.483 --> 34:46.155
(beep)
 HELLO?

34:46.155 --> 34:48.757
BREE, YOU GOTTA GET THAT MAN
OUT OF YOUR BEDROOM RIGHT NOW!

34:48.757 --> 34:51.820
WHAT? THERE'S NO MAN
IN MY ROOM.
 OH, GOOD,

34:51.820 --> 34:54.123
'CAUSE IT WAS JUST ABOUT TO GET
A WHOLE LOT MORE CROWDED.

34:54.123 --> 34:55.563
Orson is home.
 (gasps)

35:09.778 --> 35:11.780
ORSON.

35:14.443 --> 35:16.615
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.347
Is something wrong?

35:27.496 --> 35:29.798
WHY ARE YOU BACK SO SOON?

35:29.798 --> 35:31.800
I'M COMING DOWN WITH A COLD.

35:31.800 --> 35:36.865
YOU KNOW HOW I HATE TO BE SICK
AWAY FROM HOME.

35:36.865 --> 35:38.407
(hangers rattle)

35:38.407 --> 35:39.908
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:42.471 --> 35:46.415
THERE ARE TWO GLASSES DOWNSTAIRS
AND ONE HAS WINE.

35:46.415 --> 35:49.448
You are obviously
not alone here.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.750
WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?

35:51.750 --> 35:53.752
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL
WHAT I'M IMPLYING, BREE.

35:53.752 --> 35:56.425
WHO WAS DRINKING THE WINE?

35:56.425 --> 35:57.886
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

35:57.886 --> 36:00.559
I AM INSULTED THAT YOU WOULD
EVEN THINK THAT--

36:00.559 --> 36:03.792
BREE, WHERE ARE YOU?
OH, THERE YOU ARE!

36:03.792 --> 36:05.764
ORSON.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.766
WOW, I POP HOME
FOR FIVE MINUTES

36:07.766 --> 36:09.768
TO TOSS SOME CLOTHES
IN THE DRYER,

36:09.768 --> 36:13.402
AND YOU GOT A MAN
IN YOUR BEDROOM.
 (chuckles nervously)

36:13.402 --> 36:15.404
YOU WERE HERE TONIGHT?

36:15.404 --> 36:18.307
OH, YEAH. JUST TOSSIN' BACK
A LITTLE VINO AND GOSSIPING.

36:18.307 --> 36:22.411
YES, THIS GIRL KNOWS
EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYBODY.

36:26.485 --> 36:29.618
IS THERE ANY WINE LEFT?
I COULD USE A GLASS.

36:29.618 --> 36:32.521
YES, DOWNSTAIRS ON THE TABLE.
YOU GO ON AHEAD.

36:32.521 --> 36:34.893
WE'RE GONNA FINISH UP
OUR GIRL TALK.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.903
(lowered voice)
WHERE ARE THE CLOTHES?
 (lowered voice)
BEHIND THE PILLOW.

36:47.436 --> 36:49.478
(door closes)

36:49.478 --> 36:52.581
HEY. YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO JUMP.

36:52.581 --> 36:55.984
THERE'S ROSE BUSHES,
SO PUT YOUR PANTS ON FIRST.

36:58.747 --> 37:00.949
ANGIE, I CAN'T THANK YOU
ENOUGH.

37:00.949 --> 37:04.553
I DIDN'T DO THIS FOR YOU.
I DID IT FOR ORSON.

37:04.553 --> 37:07.225
FOR ORSON?
 I DEFENDED YOU.

37:07.225 --> 37:11.600
I TOLD HIM YOU HAD TOO MUCH
CLASS TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
 I UNDERSTAND YOUR DISDAIN,

37:11.600 --> 37:13.502
BUT THIS IS
A COMPLICATED SITUATION.

37:13.502 --> 37:16.505
LET ME MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR YOU--
TWO MEN WANT YOU. CHOOSE ONE.

37:16.505 --> 37:18.367
BUT WHICH ONE?

37:18.367 --> 37:20.369
ORSON'S BLACKMAILING ME
TO STAY WITH HIM.

37:20.369 --> 37:22.571
HE'S MANIPULATIVE
AND CALCULATING AND--

37:22.571 --> 37:25.514
THEN GO WITH LOVER BOY.
 BUT WHAT KIND OF LIFE
WOULD I HAVE WITH KARL?

37:25.514 --> 37:27.746
HE'S CRASS AND CONCEITED

37:27.746 --> 37:31.680
AND THE ONLY THING WE SEEM
TO HAVE IN COMMON IS SEX.
 THEN WHY ARE YOU
HAVING AN AFFAIR

37:31.680 --> 37:35.454
WITH SOMEONE
YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE?
 (whispers)
DID I MENTION THE SEX?

37:35.454 --> 37:37.456
(normal voice)
KARL BRINGS OUT PASSION IN ME

37:37.456 --> 37:40.729
I NEVER KNEW I HAD.
I MELT EVERY TIME HE TOUCHES ME.

37:40.729 --> 37:42.731
GREAT! THEN FIND A WAY OUT
OF YOUR MARRIAGE

37:42.731 --> 37:46.765
AND--AND START BUILDING A LIFE
WITH THIS... KARL.
 I WOULD. IT'S JUST...

37:46.765 --> 37:49.037
WHAT?

37:54.042 --> 37:56.575
(whispers) ORSON LIKES OPERA.

38:15.023 --> 38:17.065
HEY, YOU BUSY?

38:17.065 --> 38:18.367
NO.

38:18.367 --> 38:22.000
SO, DID, UH, GABY TALK TO YOU
LAST NIGHT?

38:22.000 --> 38:25.334
NO. BUT I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

38:25.334 --> 38:28.637
OH.
 I WANT YOU TO RUN
THE MIAMI OFFICE.

38:28.637 --> 38:31.940
WHAT?
 IF IT ISN'T GONNA BE TERRENCE,
THEN IT HAS TO BE YOU.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.312
THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY
IS AT STAKE.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.545
I NEED MY BEST PEOPLE
ON THE SPOT.

38:36.545 --> 38:38.016
IT WON'T BE FOREVER,

38:38.016 --> 38:40.719
AND DEPENDING ON HOW THINGS GO
AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS,

38:40.719 --> 38:44.993
MAYBE YOU COULD EVEN MOVE BACK
AND TELECOMMUTE FROM HERE.
 CARLOS, WHAT IS THIS?

38:44.993 --> 38:46.595
WHAT'S WHAT?

38:46.595 --> 38:49.498
OH, COME ON, I KNOW YOU KNOW
I'M PREGNANT.

38:49.498 --> 38:53.101
(flatly) YOU'RE PREGNANT?
WOW. GREAT.

38:53.101 --> 38:55.103
CARLOS, PLEASE,
I KNOW GABY TOLD YOU.

38:55.103 --> 38:58.006
NOPE.

38:58.006 --> 39:01.069
I WOULD REMEMBER SOMEBODY
TELLING ME SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

39:03.512 --> 39:05.444
SO WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER?

39:05.444 --> 39:09.718
YOU SEND SOMEONE ELSE
TO MIAMI... (sighs)

39:09.718 --> 39:12.421
AND I STAY HERE.
THAT'S MY ANSWER.

39:12.421 --> 39:16.785
EXCEPT I NEED YOU IN MIAMI,
AND I DON'T NEED YOU HERE.

39:16.785 --> 39:18.557
NOT ANYMORE.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.789
CARLOS, I AM SORRY.

39:20.789 --> 39:23.792
I KNOW I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
WHEN I FIRST FOUND OUT.

39:23.792 --> 39:27.436
BELIEVE ME, I WISH I HAD NOW.
BUT...

39:27.436 --> 39:29.938
YOU CAN'T FIRE ME
FOR BEING PREGNANT.

39:29.938 --> 39:33.572
I'M NOT FIRING YOU, LYNETTE.
I'M OFFERING YOU A PROMOTION.

39:33.572 --> 39:36.575
IF YOU CHOOSE TO TURN IT DOWN
AND QUIT INSTEAD,

39:36.575 --> 39:38.477
I CAN'T STOP YOU.

39:38.477 --> 39:41.580
ALL I CAN DO
IS SAY GOOD LUCK.

39:41.580 --> 39:44.553
AND CONGRATULATIONS.

39:44.553 --> 39:47.916
(door opens)

39:47.916 --> 39:52.861
NO, IT'S LATE,
AND I STILL GOTTA CLOSE UP.

39:52.861 --> 39:58.627
YEAH, UM...
TOMORROW'S NO GOOD EITHER.

39:58.627 --> 40:01.530
LISTEN, YOU'RE A NICE GUY.

40:01.530 --> 40:04.072
I'M JUST NOT LOOKING
FOR A RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW.

40:04.072 --> 40:06.004
SORRY.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.006
HELLO?

40:08.006 --> 40:10.839
(beep)

40:10.839 --> 40:13.842
I KNOW YOU GIRLS THINK
THAT'S LETTIN' A GUY DOWN EASY,

40:13.842 --> 40:16.945
BUT, UH, TRUST ME, IT AIN'T.

40:16.945 --> 40:20.619
(chuckles) YOU OKAY FOR NOW?
I GOTTA CLEAN UP IN THE BACK.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.651
YEAH. I'M GOOD.

40:32.561 --> 40:35.734
(beeping)

40:35.734 --> 40:37.566
(phone rings)

40:37.566 --> 40:40.539
AGENT PADILLA?

40:40.539 --> 40:42.711
LITTLE MEMORY QUIZ FOR YOU.

40:42.711 --> 40:45.644
THIS IS BLACK OWL.

40:45.644 --> 40:49.047
(chuckles) DAMN, CHRIS,
STILL SHARP AS A TACK, HUH?

40:49.047 --> 40:52.050
NO, NO, NO, NO. DON'T--DON'T ASK
ME ANYTHING. DON'T TALK.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.483
THIS CONVERSATION WILL LAST
LESS THAN 60 SECONDS.

40:54.483 --> 40:55.954
WE BOTH KNOW WHY.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.956
I'M THINKING ABOUT COMIN' IN.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.958
YOU INTERRUPT ME AGAIN,
AND I HANG UP.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.030
I SAID I WAS THINKIN' ABOUT IT.

41:02.030 --> 41:04.032
NOW HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED
TO THINK ABOUT.

41:04.032 --> 41:06.194
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME,

41:06.194 --> 41:08.196
BUT I HAVE TO KNOW
SHE GETS A PASS.

41:08.196 --> 41:10.198
THERE'LL BE
NO FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THIS

41:10.198 --> 41:12.541
UNTIL THAT IS FIRM.
NEXT TIME YOU HEAR FROM ME,

41:12.541 --> 41:15.744
YOU WILL HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT
QUESTION, AND IT BETTER BE YES.

41:20.248 --> 41:22.911
YOU EAVESDROPPIN' ON ME?

41:22.911 --> 41:25.253
NO.

41:25.253 --> 41:27.756
NO, I JUST GOT HERE.

41:27.756 --> 41:30.488
AND I WANNA GO HOME.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.566
I'LL SEE YOU.

41:39.628 --> 41:40.929
(door bells jingle)

41:43.131 --> 41:45.774
THERE IS A COFFEE SHOP
IN FAIRVIEW.

41:47.536 --> 41:49.538
IT'S KNOWN AS A PLACE

41:49.538 --> 41:52.681
WHERE YOU CAN READ
YOUR MORNING PAPER...

41:52.681 --> 41:57.015
WHERE YOU CAN MEET
YOUR FRIENDS...

41:57.015 --> 41:59.788
WHERE YOU CAN HAVE
A CUP OF COFFEE

41:59.788 --> 42:02.991
AT THE END OF A LONG DAY.

42:04.693 --> 42:06.224
(dishes clatter)

42:06.224 --> 42:08.096
YES,

42:08.096 --> 42:11.600
IT WAS A PLACE
KNOWN FOR MANY THINGS.

42:11.600 --> 42:12.661
(jingles)

42:12.661 --> 42:14.663
OH.

42:14.663 --> 42:17.165
HEY.
DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING?

42:17.165 --> 42:18.536
(click)

42:18.536 --> 42:20.138
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

42:22.170 --> 42:23.842
(grunting)

42:23.842 --> 42:26.915
(jangles)

42:26.915 --> 42:30.078
BUT AFTER THIS NIGHT,

42:30.078 --> 42:32.581
IT WOULD BE KNOWN
FOR SOMETHING...

42:32.581 --> 42:35.654
(jingles)

42:35.654 --> 42:38.857
FAR WORSE.
