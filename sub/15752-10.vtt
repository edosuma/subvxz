00:12.033 --> 00:13.167
This is the last time

00:13.167 --> 00:14.700
I spend good money
on a new mattress.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.167
They weren't even
in the apartment,

00:16.167 --> 00:17.233
just the building.

00:17.233 --> 00:18.267
Are you sure
that you--

00:18.267 --> 00:19.433
We shared a wall
with bedbugs!

00:19.433 --> 00:20.900
They're too small.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.433
By the time you know
you have them, it's too late.

00:22.433 --> 00:24.000
Did you hear
about that guy?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.667
He started with all the itching,
and then he got an infection--

00:25.667 --> 00:27.000
Right, and then he had
his hand cut off.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.267
You heard that story?

00:28.267 --> 00:29.400
Yes, but it's
an urban myth.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.400
But I agree.
I agree.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.633
Don't take any chances.

00:31.633 --> 00:33.433
The exterminator comes
in one hour.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.500
I am going to stay
at my cousin's in Riverdale.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.633
When she steals
her kids' Ritalin,

00:36.633 --> 00:38.000
she's really fun.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.600
So I'll see you kids
in two days.

00:39.600 --> 00:40.600
Good luck.

00:41.967 --> 00:43.367
Ugh!

00:43.367 --> 00:45.300
Oh, you're looking at me
like I have cooties.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.500
You don't, do you?

00:46.500 --> 00:48.400
No, the bedbugs were
most definitely

00:48.400 --> 00:49.533
not in our apartment.

00:49.533 --> 00:50.800
I am completely
bedbug free.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.667
Well, we'll see
about that.

00:52.667 --> 00:54.867
I'm gonna have to do a thorough
physical examination.

00:54.867 --> 00:57.233
Are you sure your roommates
won't mind if I stay?

00:57.233 --> 00:59.100
No, of course not.
They love you.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.767
But you should probably take
a really hot shower

01:01.767 --> 01:04.367
and shave off all your body hair
before you come over.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.067
All of it.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.067
You wish.

01:09.267 --> 01:10.933
- I'm serious.
- Come on, dude.

01:18.167 --> 01:20.133
(woman)
* Running, running, running,
running, running behind *

01:20.133 --> 01:22.167
* Yeah, I'm always
really running behind, yo *

01:22.167 --> 01:24.133
* Running, running, running,
running, running behind *

01:24.133 --> 01:26.433
* Yeah, I'm always
really running behind, yo *

01:26.433 --> 01:30.667
*

01:39.067 --> 01:40.133
[laughs]

01:40.133 --> 01:41.400
How did this happen?

01:41.400 --> 01:43.700
Joanne from
my book clu--uh, the--

01:43.700 --> 01:44.933
I mean,
that suburban book club

01:44.933 --> 01:46.467
must have started
a campaign.

01:46.467 --> 01:47.967
There's, like,
over 100 of these.

01:47.967 --> 01:49.900
Liza, do you realize
what you've done?

01:49.900 --> 01:51.667
This is real.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.367
We have to tell Charles.

01:55.433 --> 01:56.933
So I need those PPBs
on my desk

01:56.933 --> 01:58.267
by the end of the week.

01:58.267 --> 01:59.733
That's all I have.
Any other business?

01:59.733 --> 02:03.667
As a matter of fact,
our very own Liza Miller

02:03.667 --> 02:05.600
found a book in the slush pile,

02:05.600 --> 02:07.933
and it's suddenly getting
a lot of attention.

02:07.933 --> 02:09.100
Really?

02:09.100 --> 02:10.067
How's that?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.433
Well...

02:13.433 --> 02:14.867
this book
is incredible.

02:14.867 --> 02:17.533
It's an epic,
multigenerational tale

02:17.533 --> 02:18.667
of this Southern family.

02:18.667 --> 02:19.900
I had an inkling
it might play well

02:19.900 --> 02:21.500
in the suburban
book club crowd,

02:21.500 --> 02:23.900
so I sent it to one.

02:23.900 --> 02:26.167
After we agreed
upon that strategy.

02:26.167 --> 02:27.433
E-exactly.

02:27.433 --> 02:29.367
I feel it's always good
to keep a finger

02:29.367 --> 02:31.067
on the suburban pulse.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.367
Yes, she does.

02:32.367 --> 02:33.667
Anyway,

02:33.667 --> 02:35.633
as it turns out,
they loved it.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.100
They raved about it
on Goodreads,

02:37.100 --> 02:38.800
and then other suburban
book clubs started to read it,

02:38.800 --> 02:41.100
and now there's actually
a campaign

02:41.100 --> 02:42.633
to get us to publish it.

02:42.633 --> 02:43.967
The book is called
The Scarf,

02:43.967 --> 02:45.533
and people have been
sending in their scarves

02:45.533 --> 02:46.833
all morning.

02:48.733 --> 02:51.100
I, uh--I'm impressed.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.133
Get me a copy.

02:52.133 --> 02:53.533
I'll read it tonight.

02:53.533 --> 02:56.133
And we will talk
in the morning.

02:56.133 --> 02:57.333
Nice job, Liza.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.100
And me.

03:04.067 --> 03:06.600
Since when do you read books
from the slush pile?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.533
Um, I told you I was.

03:08.533 --> 03:09.800
I thought you were joking.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.300
And what on Earth
made you think

03:11.300 --> 03:13.467
it was appropriate
to go to Charles directly?

03:13.467 --> 03:16.067
You girls in your 20s
have absolutely no boundaries.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.300
I'm sorry.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.567
"I'm sorry"
doesn't fix anything.

03:18.567 --> 03:19.767
Get me a copy ASAP.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.600
And clean up
those damn scarves.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.133
Cubicle looks like
a Stevie Nicks estate sale.

03:26.733 --> 03:28.433
Well, that can't be good.

03:28.433 --> 03:29.900
No, no, no, no.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.100
We are not gonna let her
kill this buzz.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.867
We're gonna go out
and celebrate tonight.

03:34.867 --> 03:36.667
Thad and I will take
Josh and you out to dinner.

03:36.667 --> 03:38.067
Oh, no, no,
you don't have to do that.

03:38.067 --> 03:39.500
Yeah, we do.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.133
It's about time we have
a proper double date anyway.

03:49.733 --> 03:53.133
A toast to my friend
and mentee

03:53.133 --> 03:54.533
Liza Miller.

03:54.533 --> 03:56.067
- Mentee?
- Yeah, that's not a word.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.767
Absolutely not a word.

03:57.767 --> 04:00.733
To a long and successful
editorial career.

04:00.733 --> 04:01.800
You know what?

04:01.800 --> 04:03.167
It's only a matter of time

04:03.167 --> 04:05.167
before she and I
are running Empirical together.

04:05.167 --> 04:07.167
Oh, guys, look!

04:07.167 --> 04:09.967
The placemats list
the relationship compatibility

04:09.967 --> 04:12.067
of all the signs
on the Chinese zodiac.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.200
Uh-oh.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.700
Let's see if we're
compatible, huh?

04:14.700 --> 04:16.466
(Josh)
I am the Year
of the Horse.

04:16.466 --> 04:18.067
Yeah, that's what I heard.

04:18.067 --> 04:20.733
(Josh)
And you're the Year
of the Dragon.

04:20.733 --> 04:23.600
Oh, no,
it's not a good match.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.733
(Liza)
No, no, no,
we are a good match.

04:24.733 --> 04:26.433
I'm the Year of the Ti...

04:26.433 --> 04:30.100
phoid scare of 1988,
which also

04:30.100 --> 04:31.833
happens to be
the Year of the Dragon.

04:31.833 --> 04:32.933
So yup.

04:32.933 --> 04:34.500
Oh, wow, look.
Yup, it's true.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.833
We're horrible,
terrible.

04:35.833 --> 04:37.533
Oh, we're the worst match.
Oh, wow.

04:37.533 --> 04:38.900
What you gonna do?

04:38.900 --> 04:41.067
I don't care about
what this placemat says.

04:41.067 --> 04:42.500
I've always had a thing
for dragons.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.933
By the way,
just for the record,

04:43.933 --> 04:47.200
the snake really goes
with the rabbit.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.567
Hey, just like that thing
you keep by your bed.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.200
What? You were talking
about his dong.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.233
Why can't I talk
about your vibrator?

04:55.233 --> 04:56.633
To Kelsey's vibrator.

04:56.633 --> 04:58.600
To Kelsey's vibrator.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.067
Yay!
Oh, come on, Kelsey.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.467
You got to give it up
for that.

05:02.467 --> 05:04.967
[chuckles]
Okay, guys, night-night.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.667
Don't you let
the bedbugs--

05:06.667 --> 05:08.067
Stop.
Don't remind me.

05:08.067 --> 05:09.833
(Josh)
Yo, thanks for coming
to Brooklyn.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.233
- Good night, you guys.
- See you next time.

05:12.433 --> 05:14.600
Hey, can we not mention

05:14.600 --> 05:16.900
the whole bedbug thing
to my roommates?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.733
They may not know how
to clean a toilet,

05:18.733 --> 05:21.633
but they will freak out
about those little suckers.

05:21.633 --> 05:23.133
Of course.

05:23.133 --> 05:25.433
Hey, did you get your
bedroom door fixed yet?

05:25.433 --> 05:27.567
Yes, I fixed it yesterday.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.067
Oh, thank god.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.500
I was afraid I wasn't going
to get any sleep.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.633
You still may not get
any sleep.

05:32.633 --> 05:33.800
Mm.

05:34.967 --> 05:36.067
(man)
Dude, no, no, no.

05:36.067 --> 05:37.333
No, no, behind your back.

05:37.333 --> 05:38.667
The guy with the machete.
Come on, man!

05:38.667 --> 05:39.733
- Oh!
- Ooh!

05:39.733 --> 05:42.500
[men talking]

05:42.500 --> 05:44.167
- Wow.
- Jesus.

05:44.167 --> 05:46.633
Yo, what are
you guys doing?

05:46.633 --> 05:48.633
- Hey!
- Hey!

05:48.633 --> 05:49.933
What's up, man?

05:49.933 --> 05:51.467
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

05:51.467 --> 05:54.067
- What's up?
- It's good to see you, bro.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.567
Yeah, we got bored
with Philly,

05:55.567 --> 05:57.933
so we decided to drive up here
the last minute and...

05:57.933 --> 05:58.933
- Crash.
- Just crash.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.500
Nice. That's great.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.600
Oh, and who
do we have here?

06:02.600 --> 06:04.067
This is Liza.

06:04.067 --> 06:06.733
This is Jimmy Z.
This is Ryan.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.067
They used to live
in the neighborhood.

06:08.067 --> 06:09.233
Nice to meet you,
girl.

06:09.233 --> 06:10.433
[Liza laughs]

06:10.433 --> 06:11.467
Yo, that's good.

06:11.467 --> 06:13.200
So is this
your new girlfriend?

06:13.200 --> 06:15.567
Uh...

06:15.567 --> 06:19.067
I--we're...
hanging out?

06:19.067 --> 06:20.433
Right?

06:20.433 --> 06:21.800
- Hanging out?
- Yeah.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.833
Yeah, okay.

06:23.833 --> 06:26.567
Uh, even though, according
to the Chinese zodiac,

06:26.567 --> 06:27.633
we're not even compatible.

06:27.633 --> 06:28.833
I know, right?

06:28.833 --> 06:30.967
What you gonna do?

06:30.967 --> 06:34.133
I'm gonna--I'm gonna--

06:34.133 --> 06:36.400
I'm just gonna--
[clears throat]

06:38.333 --> 06:41.800
Okay, there's a situation
in that toilet.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.533
Serious--seriously?

06:43.533 --> 06:46.067
Come on, du--
whose is it?

06:46.733 --> 06:47.967
Gabe was there last.

06:47.967 --> 06:49.533
(Gabe)
No, Roman went in after me.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.167
I did not!
What?

06:51.167 --> 06:53.367
Okay, it was me.

06:53.367 --> 06:55.633
I tried flushing three times.
It wouldn't go down.

06:55.633 --> 06:57.067
I'm not a toilet wizard!

06:57.067 --> 06:59.200
You plunge, bro,
all right?

06:59.200 --> 07:00.567
You plunge.

07:00.567 --> 07:01.800
I'm gonna go use

07:01.800 --> 07:02.933
the restaurant bathroom
downstairs.

07:02.933 --> 07:04.067
That is a great idea.

07:04.067 --> 07:05.533
Oh, hey, hey,
will you pick up

07:05.533 --> 07:07.967
a roll of toilet paper
while you're down there?

07:07.967 --> 07:09.500
Yeah, and Imodium
for my diarrhea, please.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.733
I'll do the best I can.

07:10.733 --> 07:12.500
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.933
[door closes]

07:13.933 --> 07:16.200
Yo, that--that wasn't
that weird, right?

07:16.200 --> 07:17.800
The whole girlfriend thing?

07:17.800 --> 07:18.867
No, that was
totally weird, dude.

07:18.867 --> 07:20.267
Yeah, it was--

07:20.267 --> 07:22.167
(Jimmy)
You could not be
more screwed, bro, yeah.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.467
[weakly]
Coffee.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.400
Oh, my god.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.933
You look so tired.

07:50.933 --> 07:52.100
Ugh. I know.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.533
Late night with Josh?

07:53.533 --> 07:54.700
Not in a good way.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.067
His friends
drove up from Philly

07:56.067 --> 07:58.767
to vape weed
and play videogames very loudly.

07:58.767 --> 08:00.933
I don't know I'm gonna
stay there another night.

08:00.933 --> 08:02.233
Stay with Lauren and me.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.267
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:04.267 --> 08:05.367
I'm sure it'll be
all right.

08:05.367 --> 08:07.067
Oh, my god,
that would be amazing.

08:07.067 --> 08:08.100
Thank you so much.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.400
(Charles)
Liza.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.133
I took a look
at The Scarf,

08:11.133 --> 08:14.300
and I found it
very readable.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.333
Really?
Oh, I'm so glad.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.367
Good eye.

08:17.367 --> 08:18.633
Kelsey, you have
my permission

08:18.633 --> 08:20.533
to contact the author
and make an offer.

08:20.533 --> 08:21.900
Excellent.

08:23.833 --> 08:25.500
[squeaking quietly]

08:25.500 --> 08:27.367
(Meredith)
So the question becomes,

08:27.367 --> 08:30.900
when did Lear's madness
actually begin?

08:30.900 --> 08:33.900
Was it after the entrance
of Edgar?

08:36.967 --> 08:39.067
Put your cell phones away,

08:39.067 --> 08:41.467
or I will cut your thumbs off.

08:41.467 --> 08:43.133
[cell phone buzzing]

08:45.533 --> 08:47.067
Hello?

08:47.067 --> 08:48.300
Meredith?

08:48.300 --> 08:49.600
Yes.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.067
- This is Liza Miller.
- And Kelsey Peters.

08:51.067 --> 08:52.467
We're calling
from Empirical Press,

08:52.467 --> 08:55.100
and we have some
very good news for you.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.200
We have read your copy
of The Scarf

08:56.200 --> 08:57.567
that you submitted,

08:57.567 --> 08:59.333
and we would like
to make you an offer.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.233
If you pull another stunt
like this, Cece,

09:01.233 --> 09:02.567
I will see you in hell.

09:02.567 --> 09:04.567
(Liza)
No, wait, this isn't Cece.

09:04.567 --> 09:06.700
This really is Liza Miller
from Empirical Press,

09:06.700 --> 09:09.067
and we really do want
to publish your book.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.133
Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.

09:12.133 --> 09:13.900
We would love to meet
with you in person.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.167
How soon can you come in?

09:15.167 --> 09:17.233
Uh...where are you?

09:17.233 --> 09:18.667
(Liza)
We're Midtown.

09:18.667 --> 09:20.067
Uh, I'm in Yonkers.

09:20.067 --> 09:21.500
How about an hour?

09:21.500 --> 09:24.067
(Liza)
That's great.
See you then.

09:24.067 --> 09:26.967
Whoo!
[laughs]

09:26.967 --> 09:28.667
Somebody wants
to publish my novel.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.467
Roll that in your Shakespeare
and smoke it.

09:35.467 --> 09:38.067
These stories were
passed down in my family

09:38.067 --> 09:39.933
from generation
to generation.

09:39.933 --> 09:41.233
I always wanted
to write it,

09:41.233 --> 09:42.400
but then I got married.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.900
I got a job
as a teacher.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.933
And between grading papers
and raising four kids,

09:46.933 --> 09:48.400
there was no time to write.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.133
Yet I was determined
this story must be told,

09:52.133 --> 09:55.300
so I set aside
one hour a day

09:55.300 --> 09:57.867
between midnight
and 1:00 a.m.

09:57.867 --> 09:59.900
That was all I could do,
but I did it!

09:59.900 --> 10:01.300
Every day.

10:01.300 --> 10:05.300
It took 12 long years,
but, by God, I finished it.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.700
Can I just say
you are my new hero?

10:09.933 --> 10:11.333
In my humble opinion,

10:11.333 --> 10:13.100
you could be
the next Kathryn Stockett.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.167
I mean, this could be
another sleeper hit,

10:15.167 --> 10:16.300
just like The Help.

10:16.300 --> 10:19.633
Well, that all works
for me. [laughs]

10:24.433 --> 10:26.967
That is the best feeling
in the world.

10:26.967 --> 10:28.167
[laughs]

10:28.167 --> 10:29.933
Every once in a while,
we get reminded

10:29.933 --> 10:31.567
that what we do
is pretty magical.

10:31.567 --> 10:33.767
I don't know what I'm more
excited about at this point:

10:33.767 --> 10:36.067
making that woman's life
or getting a good night's sleep.

10:36.067 --> 10:37.367
Are you sure it's okay

10:37.367 --> 10:38.333
that I stay the night
with you guys?

10:38.333 --> 10:39.967
It's okay.
I checked.

10:39.967 --> 10:42.300
And you are going to love
Todd and Denise.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.367
Who are Todd and Denise?

10:43.367 --> 10:44.700
- Hey!
- Hi, sweetheart.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.467
- Hello.
- Hi, welcome.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.000
- Come on up, honey.
- Come on up.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.733
(Todd)
Get up here.

10:49.733 --> 10:52.133
Wow, you live
with Lauren's parents?

10:52.133 --> 10:53.400
Did I not mention that?

10:54.700 --> 10:55.867
Come on.

10:55.867 --> 10:57.233
(Todd)
Get on up here. Come on.

10:57.233 --> 10:59.133
It's my second daughter.
Look at her.

10:59.133 --> 11:00.833
- Hi, honey.
- You need a better coat.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.067
- Get up here!
- Come on.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.267
It's so great
to finally meet you.

11:06.267 --> 11:07.433
This is where we live.
I design jewelry.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.633
Todd has a small hedge fund.

11:08.633 --> 11:11.133
Small?
It's not that small.

11:11.133 --> 11:13.300
It is not small,
and I can attest to that.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.567
So happy you're here.

11:14.567 --> 11:15.733
I feel like

11:15.733 --> 11:17.433
I'm running some cool
sorority house.

11:17.433 --> 11:18.700
You can stay
as long as you want.

11:18.700 --> 11:19.800
I mean, ask her.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.167
No, it's good.
I don't mind.

11:21.167 --> 11:22.200
I love being a den mother.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.567
We'll get her towels.

11:23.567 --> 11:25.800
All right, yours are
the pink towels, all right?

11:25.800 --> 11:26.833
Don't use the wrong color.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.367
Rosa gets furious.

11:28.367 --> 11:30.133
Rosa.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.767
How long have you been living
with Lauren's parents?

11:33.767 --> 11:35.200
Um, two years?

11:35.200 --> 11:36.800
Two years?

11:36.800 --> 11:38.400
Well, it started out
we were just gonna stay

11:38.400 --> 11:39.800
until we found a place.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.067
But then we realized
we're never gonna be able

11:42.067 --> 11:43.900
to live in Manhattan
with our salaries.

11:43.900 --> 11:46.167
Rosa does
all of our laundry.

11:46.167 --> 11:49.067
Denise is like the Jewish
mother that I never had.

11:49.067 --> 11:53.600
And the alternative is,
well, bedbugs.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.833
Don't make me
unleash them on you.

11:54.833 --> 11:56.067
I am their queen now.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.733
[shrieks]

11:57.733 --> 11:59.233
(Denise)
Oh, The Scarf!

11:59.233 --> 12:00.567
I can't wait
to read this.

12:00.567 --> 12:02.067
I'm gonna give it
to my friend

12:02.067 --> 12:03.533
on the Real Housewives
of New York.

12:03.533 --> 12:05.133
- [gasps]
- She won't read it.

12:05.133 --> 12:07.200
I mean, she doesn't really
read or see peripheral

12:07.200 --> 12:08.533
since her last eye tuck.

12:08.533 --> 12:10.767
But she can hold it up
on camera.

12:10.767 --> 12:11.800
Oh, my god.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.067
That would be amazing.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.167
Right?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.733
- [scoffs]
- What?

12:15.733 --> 12:17.067
Josh.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.100
Junk shot?

12:18.100 --> 12:19.600
Well, I want
to see.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.100
Oh, that is his idea
of sexting?

12:22.100 --> 12:23.933
- Not usually.
- Well, what is it?

12:23.933 --> 12:24.933
Piece of poop.

12:24.933 --> 12:26.400
Ew.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.100
Wait, wait, are you into that?
No judgment.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.367
[laughs]
No.

12:29.367 --> 12:31.433
No, it was
an inside joke thing.

12:31.433 --> 12:32.767
There was, like, a--

12:32.767 --> 12:34.400
Ah, never mind.

12:34.400 --> 12:35.867
Okay, you're all red.

12:35.867 --> 12:37.567
Is Josh your boyfriend?

12:37.567 --> 12:38.433
Uh...

12:38.433 --> 12:40.900
we're hanging out.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.367
Hanging out?
Oh, god.

12:42.367 --> 12:43.600
What is it with--

12:43.600 --> 12:46.300
hanging out is not
a thing, okay?

12:46.300 --> 12:47.700
What is it
with you girls?

12:47.700 --> 12:50.100
It's like Tinder this,
Snapchat that.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.067
The world is not
one big booty call.

12:52.067 --> 12:53.367
And they're great
together.

12:53.367 --> 12:55.600
I keep telling her
she needs to lock it down.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.267
And I keep telling her
she doesn't.

12:57.267 --> 12:58.767
Yeah, and don't listen to her.

12:58.767 --> 13:00.833
She will sleep with anything
that moves, right?

13:00.833 --> 13:02.133
Male, female,

13:02.133 --> 13:04.633
trans, amphibian...

13:04.633 --> 13:05.933
That's what
we should all be doing.

13:05.933 --> 13:07.533
The world would be
a far better place

13:07.533 --> 13:09.067
if everyone was polyamorous,

13:09.067 --> 13:10.500
you and dad included.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.067
Oh, please don't put
that vision in my head,

13:12.067 --> 13:13.300
all right?

13:13.300 --> 13:14.367
It's bad enough
I have to picture him

13:14.367 --> 13:15.400
having sex with me.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.667
Look, I'm in no rush.

13:16.667 --> 13:18.100
And I have
absolutely no interest

13:18.100 --> 13:19.433
in pressuring Josh.

13:19.433 --> 13:21.833
Okay, then.
Don't answer that text.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.067
Right?

13:23.067 --> 13:24.100
Let him chase you.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.533
Men love the chase.

13:25.533 --> 13:27.467
Promise me you're not gonna
answer that text

13:27.467 --> 13:28.633
till tomorrow morning.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.300
You're right.
I won't.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.433
I am absolutely
not answering that text.

13:32.433 --> 13:33.433
- Promise?
- Of course.

13:33.433 --> 13:34.900
I don't believe you.

13:34.900 --> 13:37.267
[laughter]

13:59.600 --> 14:01.867
- Oh.
- Oh, sorry.

14:01.867 --> 14:02.933
She has you in here?

14:02.933 --> 14:04.067
Uh, yeah.

14:04.067 --> 14:06.533
Okay.

14:06.533 --> 14:08.433
- You warm enough?
- Yup.

14:08.433 --> 14:09.500
Not too warm?

14:09.500 --> 14:10.800
I will--I can open
the window.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.600
- You want met to--
- No, just fine.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.533
Okay.

14:15.533 --> 14:17.367
Do you need any water
or anything?

14:17.367 --> 14:18.400
Water...

14:18.400 --> 14:19.633
No, I'm good.

14:19.633 --> 14:22.400
Almond milk, soy milk,
something like that?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.833
No, thank you.

14:26.667 --> 14:29.167
Well, I'll be right next door
if you need anything,

14:29.167 --> 14:30.167
anything at all.

14:30.167 --> 14:31.300
Okey-dokey.

14:41.167 --> 14:42.767
Well, text from Lauren.

14:42.767 --> 14:43.833
Denise loved you,

14:43.833 --> 14:45.567
and Todd says
come back any time.

14:45.567 --> 14:46.633
[laughs uncomfortably]

14:46.633 --> 14:47.933
That's--that's so nice.

14:47.933 --> 14:49.133
Oh, how cute.

14:49.133 --> 14:50.800
Did you two
walk to work together?

14:50.800 --> 14:52.167
Actually, we had
a slumber party.

14:52.167 --> 14:53.200
[both laugh]

14:53.200 --> 14:54.633
- Funny story--
- No time.

14:54.633 --> 14:57.233
We have a meeting scheduled
with Meredith Montgomery.

14:57.233 --> 14:59.067
Oh, wait.
When?

14:59.067 --> 15:00.667
Now. I set it up.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.533
Maybe you forgot.

15:02.533 --> 15:04.633
I still run
the marketing department.

15:10.700 --> 15:13.200
Oh, you must be Meredith.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.233
Diana Trout.

15:14.233 --> 15:15.367
You wanted me
in on this?

15:15.367 --> 15:16.367
Oh, yes,
this is our publisher,

15:16.367 --> 15:17.367
Charles Brooks.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.067
I loved your book.

15:19.067 --> 15:20.333
I think we're going to have
a big success on our hands.

15:20.333 --> 15:21.933
Thank you.

15:21.933 --> 15:24.233
Yes, The Scarf
is a compelling read.

15:24.233 --> 15:26.500
But it was more compelling

15:26.500 --> 15:28.233
the first time
it was published,

15:28.233 --> 15:30.767
as The Babushka.

15:32.267 --> 15:34.433
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.500
What are you
talking about?

15:36.500 --> 15:39.567
The Babushka
by Anna Cleveman Daniels,

15:39.567 --> 15:42.067
a little-read book
written back in the '80s

15:42.067 --> 15:43.233
about a Jewish family

15:43.233 --> 15:44.733
chronicling their
five generations

15:44.733 --> 15:47.367
and the babushka
they passed down.

15:47.367 --> 15:49.100
I haven't heard
of that book, so...

15:50.367 --> 15:51.633
Oh, really?

15:53.367 --> 15:55.667
Perhaps I can refresh
your memory.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.300
"The severity often differs,

15:57.300 --> 15:58.767
"even the location
of the wound.

15:58.767 --> 16:01.233
"But what's never changed
is the fact

16:01.233 --> 16:03.767
"that he was
a Russian Cossack.

16:03.767 --> 16:06.300
"And my grandfather,
the boy who saved his life,

16:06.300 --> 16:09.400
was the shtetl bugler."

16:09.400 --> 16:10.900
(Kelsey)
Oh, my god.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.300
That's the same
first line,

16:13.300 --> 16:14.667
only more ethnic.

16:15.567 --> 16:16.633
Shall I continue?

16:16.633 --> 16:18.167
Do you mean
the whole thing is--

16:18.167 --> 16:22.067
A total rip-off.
The story's exactly the same.

16:22.067 --> 16:23.200
Is this true?

16:23.200 --> 16:25.867
Uh, well, I, um...

16:25.867 --> 16:27.467
uh...

16:29.200 --> 16:30.267
Oh, all right, you know what?

16:30.267 --> 16:31.500
I'm sorry.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.433
I was desperate.

16:33.433 --> 16:35.433
I have written 13 novels.

16:35.433 --> 16:38.300
I have tried every genre
under the Sun:

16:38.300 --> 16:41.067
fairy tales, romance,
vampire porn.

16:41.067 --> 16:44.100
And then I just happened upon
a box with some old books

16:44.100 --> 16:46.633
in a storage closet
in the school library,

16:46.633 --> 16:48.700
and there it was.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.300
The Babushka.

16:51.300 --> 16:54.167
It has been out of print
for years.

16:54.167 --> 16:57.600
So I thought if I put
my own family history in it,

16:57.600 --> 16:58.933
doesn't that count
for something?

17:00.167 --> 17:01.467
We can't make a deal

17:01.467 --> 17:03.167
on a book
that's been plagiarized.

17:03.167 --> 17:06.599
Liza? Kelsey?
How'd this happen?

17:06.599 --> 17:09.067
We used all the normal
search protocols.

17:09.067 --> 17:11.166
Well, thankfully,
I dug deeper.

17:12.467 --> 17:14.467
This could have been
a problem.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.433
So, Diana,
I am thankful.

17:17.433 --> 17:20.666
Well, you're welcome,
Charles.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.433
I apologize for letting
my assistant

17:25.433 --> 17:26.666
get off her leash
like that.

17:26.666 --> 17:27.800
- I am so--
- Shh! Quiet.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.167
Better luck next time.

17:31.167 --> 17:33.867
Well, I think
we're done here.

17:35.433 --> 17:37.100
Cancel her car service.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.800
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.733
I'm sorry.

17:43.733 --> 17:45.900
It's just, you start to lie,

17:45.900 --> 17:47.067
and then slowly but surely,

17:47.067 --> 17:48.533
it takes on
a life of its own.

17:48.533 --> 17:52.133
It's like you almost begin
to believe it.

17:52.133 --> 17:56.067
I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

17:56.067 --> 17:59.200
I understand
more than you could know.

18:01.433 --> 18:03.333
Was she serious
about the car service?

18:03.333 --> 18:05.200
I'm afraid so.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.733
Oh, shit.

18:12.333 --> 18:13.967
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.333
Welcome home,
roomie.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.567
Aw.

18:16.567 --> 18:17.633
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

18:17.633 --> 18:19.500
No, I really missed you.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.867
My cousin,
she has sleep apnea,

18:20.867 --> 18:22.467
and she snores
like a dying bear.

18:22.467 --> 18:24.100
Please, Josh had
clogged toilets

18:24.100 --> 18:25.867
in that frat house
he calls an apartment,

18:25.867 --> 18:29.067
and Lauren's dad
totally creeped me out.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.567
Okay, you win.
All right.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.567
Here, let's make a toast
to a bedbug-less existence.

18:33.567 --> 18:35.567
Aw, at least I have that.

18:35.567 --> 18:36.767
What happened?

18:36.767 --> 18:38.967
It was a tough day at work.

18:38.967 --> 18:40.567
That author I thought
I discovered?

18:40.567 --> 18:42.533
Turns out
she's a total fraud.

18:42.533 --> 18:43.633
Are you kidding me?

18:43.633 --> 18:45.567
Nope, plagiarized
the entire book.

18:45.567 --> 18:47.267
The Scarf
totally unraveled.

18:47.267 --> 18:48.500
Bad pun intended.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.533
Oh, my god,
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

18:50.533 --> 18:53.067
Yeah, well,
as disappointing as it is

18:53.067 --> 18:54.733
to realize you've been
championing a fraud,

18:54.733 --> 18:56.567
it's even tougher to realize
you are one.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.467
Oh, come on, now.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

18:58.467 --> 19:00.767
It's not like your lie
is hurting anybody.

19:00.767 --> 19:01.800
[moans softly]

19:01.800 --> 19:04.467
I'm not so sure about that.

19:04.467 --> 19:06.400
[door buzzer buzzing]

19:07.600 --> 19:08.800
What?

19:10.900 --> 19:12.467
(Kelsey)
Hey, come down here!

19:12.467 --> 19:13.900
We're at the bar next door.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.733
We're gonna help you
liquor your wounds.

19:17.267 --> 19:18.433
Okay.

19:25.367 --> 19:27.067
- Ugh!
- Hey.

19:27.067 --> 19:29.900
I am so sorry.
Come here.

19:29.900 --> 19:33.400
Hey, your eye was good.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.133
And you're gonna get
another book.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.133
I ordered 14 different kinds
of tequila.

19:39.133 --> 19:40.533
So nice knowing you guys.

19:40.533 --> 19:41.767
[laughs]

19:41.767 --> 19:43.267
I'm sorry you got lied to.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.900
Totally sucks.

19:44.900 --> 19:48.467
Hey, um...
[sighs]

19:48.467 --> 19:50.067
I have to tell you
something.

19:50.067 --> 19:51.600
That's funny, because I have
something to tell you too.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.833
- I need to go first.
- No, just let me go first.

19:53.833 --> 19:55.367
- Josh--
- Just listen to me, all right?

19:55.367 --> 19:56.867
It's been bugging me
for two days.

19:56.867 --> 20:00.900
The truth is, is I think
that we're doing

20:00.900 --> 20:03.800
a little bit more
than just hanging out,

20:03.800 --> 20:05.267
all right?

20:05.267 --> 20:09.067
I--I've never really been
much for words.

20:10.333 --> 20:13.233
I'm more of a man
of symbols.

20:13.233 --> 20:14.667
Oh.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.200
That's nice.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.600
It's you.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.700
It's me?

20:18.700 --> 20:20.400
Yeah, it's a dragon.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.133
Oh, my god,
it's for your birth year.

20:23.133 --> 20:24.400
Oh, my god.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.633
What do you think?

20:25.633 --> 20:27.633
I'm...

20:27.633 --> 20:29.400
sp-speechless.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.900
(woman)
* Oh, why can't you be
happy with me? *

20:31.900 --> 20:33.467
* Every day
we are running round *

20:33.467 --> 20:34.933
* trapped in our seat

20:34.933 --> 20:37.800
* Oh, why can't you be
happy with me? *
