07:57.978 --> 07:59.711
You guys gossip a lot
for a place

07:59.813 --> 08:00.762
that's supposed to be anonymous.

08:00.864 --> 08:02.714
Um, can you please

08:02.866 --> 08:05.150
sign this thing
that proves I was here?

08:05.268 --> 08:07.319
Not 'till after the meeting,
I'm afraid. (chuckles)

08:07.421 --> 08:09.754
-oh, that's, like, 45 minutes.
-It's actually longer, 'cause

08:09.857 --> 08:12.007
-I like to schmooze afterwards.
-Yeah, but I'm not one of them,

08:12.059 --> 08:13.525
-so...
-No, but if you're ever looking

08:13.627 --> 08:15.093
for more than a signature,
give me a call.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.030

you want to do alone.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.665

10:29.346 --> 10:30.645
Hey, sam.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.564
-Hi. Nice hat.
-Yeah.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.099
-Chantel forced me to wear this.
-You and joel

10:34.217 --> 10:35.700
-are getting married. Hmm.
-Yeah. I didn't

10:35.836 --> 10:37.302
-want you to find out this way.
-All right, don't be sorry.

10:37.421 --> 10:39.170
Come on. You guys have
been together a long time.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.307
This is, like, pretty
small-town inevitable, right?

10:42.376 --> 10:44.042
Yeah.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.694
So do you guys want to, like ?

10:46.780 --> 10:48.046
You can have some cake.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.382
Felicia, do you want
to have, uh, cake

10:50.484 --> 10:52.684
with the gal
who's marrying my ex-boyfriend?

10:52.786 --> 10:54.386
(snorts, laughs)

10:54.488 --> 10:56.221
-okay, sam, you...
-I would never have a slice

10:56.323 --> 10:58.306
of your skank cake.
(laughs)

10:58.358 --> 11:00.542
-oh.
-Uh, o-okay.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.861
All right, okay.

11:02.979 --> 11:04.462
Next time. Okay.

11:04.548 --> 11:06.698
-Boom, bitches.
-Just stop. Look...

11:08.568 --> 11:09.817
-Give me five.
-Oh.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.503
-Ah.
-Brit: Sam?

11:11.605 --> 11:13.021
Hey. No, no, no, no.
Use this.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.757
I don't need you spraying
all over the walls again.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.992
Oh, that last time
was me, actually.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.378
-(laremember that?
-Why are people like this?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.881
Thank you.
Sam, how you feeling?

11:23.950 --> 11:25.050
Can we help you?

11:25.152 --> 11:26.451
Can I just talk to sam?

11:27.554 --> 11:29.187
Would you like
to talk to her, sam?

11:29.289 --> 11:30.538
Yeah, why not?

11:30.590 --> 11:33.391
All right. Fine.

11:33.527 --> 11:36.361
I got to call my babysitter
anyway, so...

11:39.766 --> 11:41.216
-Oh.
-Way too small of a target.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.434
You know what I mean?

11:42.569 --> 11:45.236
Samantha, you're back
from new york.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.871
Oh, yeah.
(clears throat)

11:46.940 --> 11:49.007
living with mom. We're like
<i>grey gardens</i> on acid, you know?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.275
Oh, my god.
That sounds terrifying.

11:50.394 --> 11:51.876
My baby asleep yet or what?

11:51.945 --> 11:53.694
You have no idea.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.597
So, rehab?

11:55.682 --> 11:57.348
Oh.
(scoffs)

11:57.417 --> 11:59.551
yeah, that was just mandatory
so my office wouldn't sue.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.186
You know, it wasn't a big deal.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.721
And obviously
a huge waste of time,

12:02.806 --> 12:05.473
because I can control
my drinking when I want to.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.093
Yeah, look, sam, I just...
I want to say I'm sorry, okay?

12:08.195 --> 12:11.162
You know, since you blocked me
on all social media.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.897
Thought this was
my one chance and...

12:12.966 --> 12:15.650
Are you sorry about the hat
or the marrying my ex?

12:15.736 --> 12:17.135
I'm just a little confused.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.603
You don't have to be a dick
about it.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.288
You know joel and I have been
together for a long time,

12:20.424 --> 12:22.941
and you guys have been broken up
for a long time.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.626
Sam, life moves forward
even if you don't.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.778
Oh, my god.
That was beautiful.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.780
I got to get that
tattooed on butt.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.149
Could you just not do the whole
victimy thing right now?

12:31.284 --> 12:32.550
You know, this is exactly like

12:32.636 --> 12:34.252
when I got first chair violin
and you got last.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.788
Out of three violins.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.656
Why do you keep
bringing that up?

12:38.792 --> 12:41.459
Okay, look, I just...

12:41.595 --> 12:43.328
Everything's not always
about you.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.630
I know things have been rough
since your dad passed away.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.315
I really tried.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.167
I came to new york to meet you
at that restaurant.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.337
I sat there waiting for you
for two hours, eating edamame.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.938
Like, so much edamame, because

12:54.024 --> 12:56.274
I wanted to tell you
about this in person.

12:57.861 --> 13:00.178
I am very sorry
about that, honestly.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.014
-I was very busy that day.
-Oh, yeah?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.316
-Doing what?
-Sorry. You're right.

13:05.435 --> 13:09.487
I forgot. You're a doctor
who saves lives, so your life is

13:09.589 --> 13:11.156
-so much more important
-yeah. You know what,
-all right over here?

13:11.308 --> 13:13.591
-Than mine!
-This is just like you.
-Hey! What's going on?

13:13.660 --> 13:15.543
-Are we all right?
-Everything's totally fine.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.029
I actually have some
very important work to do

13:18.148 --> 13:19.664
-and some files and so on
and so forth.
-All right.

13:19.816 --> 13:22.650
So I'm gonna get to that, and
you ladies have a nice evening.

13:22.736 --> 13:24.135
Oh, my god.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.686
-Oh, no. Sam. Hey, sam. Sammy?
-Oh, wait.

13:25.822 --> 13:28.006
-Sammy. Sammy, you can't drive.
-No, sam, I've got lyft credits.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.208
-Sam, just, look.
-Hey, sam, sam,
just take a lyft, please.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.677
I know you hate me. Just let me
take you home in the party bus.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.546
-Okay? It's right...
-Yeah, well,
I don't know if you can

13:34.648 --> 13:36.197
-call it a party bus if
it doesn't have a stripper pole.
-Sam...

13:36.299 --> 13:38.399

13:38.485 --> 13:40.385

There-there's no stripper pole,

13:40.520 --> 13:42.203

I'm not mad. (laughs)

16:15.692 --> 16:17.091
I'm done.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.043
Yeah.
No, I know, and I'm sorry,

16:19.162 --> 16:20.545
but if you could just let me
explain to you what...

16:20.613 --> 16:22.313
It's been 24 hours
since you left rehab.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.465
You've already been arrested
for drunk driving

16:24.584 --> 16:26.767
after totaling my car, so no.

16:26.870 --> 16:28.252
Okay, so, I'm sitting
at the bar, right?

16:28.355 --> 16:29.587
-Oh, god.
-Dead sober.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.105
Swear to god
I could drive a school bus.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.590
-I'm really not. I'm just not.
-But then brit

16:32.709 --> 16:34.559
-walks in the door, okay?
-Yeah?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.177
-And she's wearing
a veil on her head,
-okay.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.730
Because it's her
bachelorette party,

16:38.832 --> 16:40.932
-and she's marrying joel.
-I know.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.667
I'm going to their wedding.

16:43.653 --> 16:45.636
-Are you kidding me?
-No. I've known brit

16:45.739 --> 16:47.121
-since she was little.
-Yes, mother,

16:47.207 --> 16:49.056
-because she was my friend.
-This isn't about brit.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.943
This is about you... Growing up.

16:52.061 --> 16:54.762
So, number one--

16:54.814 --> 16:57.215
you're gonna start
paying me rent

16:57.283 --> 16:59.117
or find another place to live.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.652
-I just got out of rehab.
-Yeah, and I spent

17:01.771 --> 17:04.004
a lot of money for that place,
money that I was saving

17:04.107 --> 17:06.391
for my neck lift, which now
I can't have because of you.

17:06.476 --> 17:08.259
Where would you like me to go?

17:08.328 --> 17:09.727
I don't have any money.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.479
That is what my book group calls

17:11.564 --> 17:14.982
not my problem.
So, you're gonna get a job,

17:15.068 --> 17:16.501
and with that job,
you're gonna pay me rent.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.408
I'm trying that
setting boundaries thing.

17:23.493 --> 17:26.394
I think I'm quite good at it.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.949
Oh, no,
you should keep the boat.

17:32.068 --> 17:33.584
I don't know how
to drive a boat,

17:33.653 --> 17:35.820
but it couldn't be that hard
to learn. (laughs)

17:35.955 --> 17:38.489
oh, um, look, o-owning a boat
is not a real problem.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.425
I got real problems,
and I got to go.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.026
Yeah. Bye.

17:42.128 --> 17:45.930
Sorry.
My sister is still "grieving."

17:45.999 --> 17:49.700
so, your lucky streak continues.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.636
-That's funny.
I don't feel very lucky.
-Oh.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.137
Well, the judge
assigned to your case

17:53.206 --> 17:54.672
approved
your pre-trial probation.

17:54.791 --> 17:56.107
-And that means?
-I mean,

17:56.176 --> 17:58.309
I recommended
60 days of jail time.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.845
-What?
-But with overcrowding
and good behavior,

18:00.980 --> 18:02.663
it would have been,
two weeks.

18:02.715 --> 18:06.084
But that judge--
he overruled me.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.719
So... So what is happening?

18:08.855 --> 18:10.004
Oh, you're not going to jail.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.823
-Mm-mmm.
-Oh, my god.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.125
No, no, no, no, no.
But over the next 12 months,

18:14.194 --> 18:17.695
you will need to complete
250 hours of community service,

18:17.797 --> 18:20.381
maintain your sobriety,
go to meetings,

18:20.500 --> 18:22.333
and complete driver's ed,
because apparently,

18:22.435 --> 18:23.551
you can't drive
without getting drunk

18:23.670 --> 18:26.070
and hitting large objects.
Just know

18:26.206 --> 18:28.406
that if you make so much
as one slip-up,

18:28.508 --> 18:30.041
you're going straight to jail.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.559
So, stay on your path,
and your case will be dismissed

18:31.644 --> 18:33.010
within the year.
It's your choice.

18:33.079 --> 18:36.347
-Seems easy enough.
-(laughs) oh, let's be honest.

18:36.416 --> 18:42.570
You make it hard.

18:42.672 --> 18:43.988
Olivia:
Hi.

18:44.057 --> 18:46.591
Uh, hi.
I have three days.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.360
I want all the booze
and all the sex

18:49.462 --> 18:51.395
and all the drugs
all at the same time.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.947
(inhales)

18:53.032 --> 18:54.582
you want to come in
for a cup of tea?

18:54.717 --> 18:56.200
It's not blow,
but it's all I have.

18:56.319 --> 18:57.502
Oh, that's all right.

18:57.587 --> 18:59.070
I only do coke
to help me drink more.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.230
Samantha:
Come on. Are serious?

19:09.332 --> 19:11.782
Way to bury the lead.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.418
-What?
-I'm olivia elliot,

19:14.521 --> 19:16.888
and this is...
<i> Off our docs.</i>

19:16.990 --> 19:18.689
You're a listener?
(chuckles)

19:18.758 --> 19:20.274
big-time.
Big-time listener.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.526
-Yeah.
-Wow.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.261
I can't believe
you're an alcoholic.

19:23.363 --> 19:26.047
Anyone can be an alcoholic.
It's a disease.

19:26.115 --> 19:29.100
Yeah.
I just meant, like,

19:29.235 --> 19:30.952
this is a lot of stuff
to get while you're drinking.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.270
Oh, I didn't get it
while I was drinking.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.071
I've been sober
for ten years.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.807
But the cash and prizes
don't all come at once, so,

19:36.943 --> 19:38.976
don't call me next week asking
me where your mortgage is.

19:39.112 --> 19:42.313
I won't.
Don't even have a job.

19:43.600 --> 19:47.318
Um, my sponsee, mindy--
she manages giovanni's market.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.787
I know she'd been looking
for a cashier.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.590
Wow. Okay. Got it.

19:52.659 --> 19:56.594
Okay. Cashier
and then peabody and then

19:56.713 --> 19:57.845
-okay.
-Sick house.

19:57.981 --> 19:59.764
-And then, awesome paint colors.
-Yeah,

19:59.832 --> 20:01.065
let's just worry
about getting the job first

20:01.134 --> 20:02.767
and let your higher power
take care of the rest.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.304
I knew it was a cult.

20:06.439 --> 20:07.488
<i> Carol:</i>
<i> So, giovanni's.</i>

20:07.607 --> 20:10.908
-Yup.
-I'm proud of you.

20:10.994 --> 20:12.677
Definitely did not think
you could do it.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.113
I'm really sorry
for crashing your car.

20:16.182 --> 20:18.149
Don't be dramatic.
It was 12 years old.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.967
They don't even make parts
for it anymore,

20:20.019 --> 20:22.436
so what are you gonna do?

20:22.505 --> 20:24.455
-What are you doing?
-What?

20:24.573 --> 20:26.290
Thought you could have
one glass of wine.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.758
No. No, I can't.

20:27.844 --> 20:29.927
Unfortunately,
that's not how it works.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.796
I can do this, though, right?

20:31.898 --> 20:33.381
That's okay?

20:33.466 --> 20:35.633
Yeah. Yeah, you can do
whatever you want, mom.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.568
Phew! (laughs)

20:37.670 --> 20:39.804
not that it's a big deal
or anything.

20:39.889 --> 20:41.555
Yeah, well, it turns out,
I can't.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.207
Apparently,
alcoholism is a disease,

20:43.326 --> 20:46.577
and, uh... Boy, do I have it.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.180
Did you just say
you have a disease?

20:49.315 --> 20:51.498
-Mom...
-You don't have a disease.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.834
I know
what a disease looks like.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.737
-Leukemia, for one.
-Right. Yeah. Look,

20:56.839 --> 20:57.955
I'm sorry. I wasn't
trying to bring up dad.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.657
-I really...
-A disease is

20:59.726 --> 21:02.326
when you can't walk
from your bed to the bathroom.

21:02.412 --> 21:04.411
Right.
I hear you.

21:04.547 --> 21:06.397
Seriously. I was just
trying to say that, like,

21:06.532 --> 21:07.965
it's recognized as a disease.

21:08.051 --> 21:10.718
You can... You can look it up,
but that's all.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.903
If you want
to call yourself sick,

21:13.039 --> 21:15.172
call yourself sick.

21:15.241 --> 21:18.559
But don't judge me
for having some wine at night,

21:18.645 --> 21:22.013
because everybody wants
to have some wine at night.

21:22.098 --> 21:24.382
It's hard to be a person.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.518
<i> Samantha:</i>

21:43.403 --> 21:45.603
-No. Jesus.
-What...

21:45.721 --> 21:48.372
-What happened?
-Didn't know
there'd be so much...

21:48.458 --> 21:50.024
Stuff and feelings or whatever.

21:50.092 --> 21:52.610
No, no, no, that's the worst
part by, like, a long shot.

21:52.762 --> 21:54.578
It's just, like,
a bunch of garbage people

21:54.681 --> 21:56.614
giving me garbage advice.
I don't need that.

21:56.766 --> 21:58.749
I could just keep doing
exactly what I'm doing,

21:58.885 --> 22:00.901
and-and one day write
an autobiography of a trash bag,

22:00.987 --> 22:04.772
featuring me,
because I am an expert.

22:04.874 --> 22:06.574
You know, like,
I'm one of them.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.610
So I'm gonna be real.
Uh, that's a terrible idea.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.078
You shouldn't write that.
That's a bad book.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.080
-That's a real bad book.
-(sighs)

22:16.085 --> 22:18.285
I do remember you.

22:18.388 --> 22:20.588
-Sure you do.
-No, I do.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.390
I kept calling you
the winklevoss twins

22:22.458 --> 22:24.642
-because you code?
-And that never
made sense because

22:24.761 --> 22:26.460
-that's two white guys.
-To be fair,

22:26.562 --> 22:28.429
you kept calling me
norah jones.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.130
But do you see
how that's not two people?

22:30.233 --> 22:32.800
-I do.
-Yeah.

22:32.902 --> 22:35.152
