01:04.400 --> 01:08.405
<i>Every year, it's weird going back to school.
Seeing each other face-to-face again,</i>

01:08.480 --> 01:11.563
<i>but at least I have my best friends,
Janice and Emily.</i>

01:13.440 --> 01:16.489
<i>We're in slo-mo, 'cause that's how
all the hot girls always show up.</i>

01:17.360 --> 01:18.361
<i>Just kidding.</i>

01:19.040 --> 01:23.523
<i>We just wanna look like we don't care.
Especially in front of the guys.</i>

01:27.000 --> 01:30.163
<i>And this is me not caring.</i>

01:33.560 --> 01:38.122
<i>And that's Janice and Lloyd,
pretending to be very complicated.</i>

01:39.720 --> 01:43.008
<i>And Wen, well,
nobody seems to care about him.</i>

01:43.000 --> 01:44.047
Hello, what's happening?

01:45.200 --> 01:50.001
<i>But when it comes to friendship, and I mean
real friendship, like with me and Kyle,</i>

01:50.520 --> 01:52.887
<i>you can officially care and just be yourself.</i>

01:53.600 --> 01:54.931
<i>Oh, and her...</i>

01:55.440 --> 01:58.523
<i>We call her the Post-it,
'cause she sticks to every guy</i>

01:58.520 --> 02:01.729
<i>and pretends that she loves them. Whatever.</i>

02:02.760 --> 02:05.570
<i>All I know is I'm sick of all the pretending.</i>

02:05.960 --> 02:07.883
<i>The truth is I just wanna have a great year.</i>

02:10.160 --> 02:13.289
<i>Just like last year
when I fell in love with Chad.</i>

02:15.560 --> 02:18.689
"Forever."

02:24.720 --> 02:28.327
<i>Speaking of forever, that's how long
Kyle and I have been friends.</i>

02:33.720 --> 02:34.767
I'm here.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.644
<i>I hope it always stays that way.</i>

02:42.360 --> 02:45.091
<i>Anyway, here we are
just going with the flow.</i>

02:45.080 --> 02:48.323
<i>Trying to love, live and laugh out loud.</i>

02:48.400 --> 02:52.325
<i>Which is nice, 'cause my name is Lola,
but everyone calls me Lol.</i>

03:01.120 --> 03:04.567
Dude, I cannot believe
she hijacked my Zadig bag!

03:04.760 --> 03:06.489
I had to special order this thing.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.483
Oh, my God, your new song is amazing.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.561
You liked it?

03:10.640 --> 03:12.244
That guitar solo is hot!

03:13.480 --> 03:15.642
Ladies, ladies, welcome back.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.647
Okay, Wen, don't even try, okay.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.210
- You know you want me.
- Yeah.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.123
Okay, I want you to leave me alone now.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.688
- I like it. Alone. Tonight?
- Yeah. Yes.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.609
Good, I'll see you tonight, alone.

03:28.560 --> 03:32.121
Oh, my God, he is so gorgeous it hurts.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.446
I can't believe you're taking trig class
just for him.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.970
- So you missed me?
- Yeah.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.210
Did you miss me?

03:44.240 --> 03:46.322
How was the camp counselor thing?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.483
It was brutal.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.121
You didn't call or text me.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.802
I did. You just didn't get it
because there was no reception.

03:55.160 --> 03:59.643
Plus, I kind of hooked up with this girl,
another counselor.

04:02.160 --> 04:05.687
Yeah, no problem. I just...

04:05.760 --> 04:07.171
It was just a onetime thing.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.886
No, it's cool, I'm happy you said that.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.885
'Cause I hooked up with somebody, too.
Just to try it.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.528
I really hope you kept his number.
I mean, I'd hate for you to end up all alone.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Got it on speed dial.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.208
Hey, Lola, you okay?

04:28.960 --> 04:29.961
Lola!

04:30.280 --> 04:31.645
Hey, Lola, you okay?

05:09.560 --> 05:11.164
Hey, so what happened with volleyball?

05:11.240 --> 05:12.401
I got a stomachache.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.403
So, you'll be the dolphin. What's his name?

05:17.720 --> 05:19.006
Lola, is that a Brazilian?

05:19.320 --> 05:20.321
Mom!

05:21.440 --> 05:22.441
Mom, what?

05:23.560 --> 05:27.360
Nothing, it's just... It's my body
and I'll take care of it how I want to.

05:27.560 --> 05:31.167
No, it's not.
And I'm not going to let you be a porn star.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.647
What's a porn star?

05:32.640 --> 05:33.641
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

05:35.800 --> 05:40.408
You haven't done anything with boys.
I mean, you would tell me, right?

05:40.480 --> 05:42.050
Yes, Mom. I would tell you.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.926
I just want to take a nice, relaxing shower
and hang out with my family.

05:46.160 --> 05:49.289
And then, here you go, putting me on trial
for my grooming choices.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.361
I'm not a baby any more.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.286
Hey, and come back
and pick up these clothes.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.681
I'm not your maid.

05:55.640 --> 05:59.167
<i>"Aren't mothers supposed to have
some kind of protective instinct?</i>

05:59.480 --> 06:04.008
<i>"She has no idea what it's like out there.
This was so not a perfect day. "</i>

06:24.640 --> 06:25.721
My baby!

06:27.480 --> 06:30.450
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too.

06:44.640 --> 06:48.008
Mom, hurry.
Mom, come on, you're making me late.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.082
Then wake up earlier.
I'm not your chauffeur.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.605
I haven't even had my coffee yet.

06:52.680 --> 06:56.480
Lola, is that my sweater?
Quit stealing my things.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.204
Oh, yeah, Mom, you want me to freeze?

06:58.200 --> 06:59.611
Depends, will it make you nicer?

07:04.120 --> 07:07.886
So here I am, driving you to school,
thinking, "This will be great.

07:07.880 --> 07:12.010
"We can have some good conversation.
We can connect with one another."

07:12.200 --> 07:14.680
But here you are in your bubble
and I'm not in that bubble.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.001
And I'm right here. I'm right here.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.731
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What? Here. Here.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.207
Go.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.802
And your reason for being late is?

08:17.200 --> 08:18.611
Well, you're going to laugh.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.524
This is as much as I laugh.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.921
- Did you see her face?
- Yeah, she totally wants me.

08:25.920 --> 08:26.921
Shut up!

08:27.560 --> 08:29.528
So, did you make up with Chad?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.001
No.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.129
Well, I just want you to know that
if I were him, I'd never let you go.

08:35.840 --> 08:36.841
Yeah, but you're not him.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.924
I know we're friends,
but I don't always agree with him.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.321
I know.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.807
And I kind of want us to stay friends.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.241
Me too.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.481
Cool.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.161
Cool.

08:55.520 --> 09:00.651
X-squared equals 9X plus 4B.
B equals 9, C equals 14.

09:00.720 --> 09:01.721
Any questions?

09:01.880 --> 09:05.123
All right, pay attention.
Let's keep it moving, people. Next equation.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.801
Emily, can you solve this?

09:15.480 --> 09:17.084
Do you need some help solving this?

09:19.040 --> 09:20.804
Okay, well, it's not that complicated.

09:21.160 --> 09:26.041
First, to find the range for F,
we must solve for the inverse of...

09:26.960 --> 09:29.167
F to the negative first power.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.882
X equals X plus one over...

10:02.400 --> 10:07.088
X plus one over X minus two.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.366
Yeah, you got that?

10:08.440 --> 10:10.886
- Yeah.
- Okay. Everybody got that?

10:17.080 --> 10:18.081
Sorry I'm late.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.486
Yeah, yeah, come in.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.729
Man, the girls are in heat.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.441
Yeah, you would know.

10:30.840 --> 10:31.841
What?

10:34.720 --> 10:35.721
What's your problem?

10:46.240 --> 10:48.129
That's not funny.
Do you want to go to the principal's office?

10:49.200 --> 10:50.440
What? It's a French baguette.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.246
Sorry I'm late.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.051
- Sorry.
- Hey, enough with the feet. Quiet, please.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.641
And you, put it away. We do not eat in class.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.563
The first one who uses his...

11:08.600 --> 11:11.251
Keep it up,
I'll cancel the spring break trip to Paris.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.121
Hi.

11:20.800 --> 11:21.801
Thanks.

11:22.560 --> 11:28.249
So, my mom wanted to know
if you do any home tutoring classes.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.126
Tutoring for what?

11:31.240 --> 11:32.446
For trig, of course.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.241
For your mother?

11:34.520 --> 11:35.851
No, for me.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.685
Right, right, right. Sorry.

11:40.480 --> 11:44.166
No, no, I'm sorry, I'm already all booked up
this semester.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.368
Wait, even on Friday nights?

11:47.760 --> 11:50.001
Yeah. Even on Friday nights.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.966
Well, that's too bad. Yeah.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.807
I guess I'll just... I'll see you around, then?

11:56.360 --> 11:57.441
Yeah, I'll see you in class.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.001
Okay, I'll see you around.

12:00.280 --> 12:01.281
I'll see you in class.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.601
Okay.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.807
When I went to talk to him in the class,
he got all blushy.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.565
- He got all red when I was talking to him.
- Oh, God! He's your teacher.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.688
- No, I don't care.
- Shut up.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.331
Okay, look. Chad's over there.
Do you wanna go?

12:14.320 --> 12:15.481
- No, it's fine.
- Why?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.688
- Why?
-'Cause she'd be happy if we left.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.450
Why is she always with them?

12:20.600 --> 12:23.331
Because she's a Post-it.
She sticks to everything.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.209
In that outfit, really? No.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.201
I know.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.930
I really like your shirt.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.680
- Yeah, I like what's under your shirt.
- Hey! Stop.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.641
- What up, what up, what up?
- Can I talk to you for a second?

12:34.480 --> 12:36.164
- Go ahead.
- Let's go.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.401
It's all right.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.925
So, now that you're giving it up
to everybody,

12:43.000 --> 12:44.968
- I figured maybe I could get some.
- Are you serious?

12:47.480 --> 12:48.481
What was all that about?

12:49.880 --> 12:52.281
- Classy, bro.
- What do you care?

12:55.920 --> 12:59.970
<i>"I hate Chad. I hate every stupid second
I spent obsessing over him!</i>

13:00.600 --> 13:01.886
<i>"What a waste!"</i>

13:08.400 --> 13:12.246
<i>- So, can I come over tonight?
- No, we can't do this every night.</i>

13:12.680 --> 13:13.920
<i>What's the point of being divorced?</i>

13:18.720 --> 13:22.486
<i>"Oh, my God!
Dad's totally hooking up with Mom again!</i>

13:22.560 --> 13:23.925
<i>"Or is it the other way around?</i>

13:23.920 --> 13:26.571
<i>"Whatever it is,
I just can't go through this again."</i>

13:27.560 --> 13:31.451
Okay, so after Jimmy Carter, it was Ron...

13:31.640 --> 13:32.766
Ronald.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.245
Ronald McDonald?

13:35.440 --> 13:36.851
You're so stupid.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.288
Ethan, please try to be human.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.686
Okay, so, Ronald Reagan.

13:43.080 --> 13:47.244
<i>I still can't believe
the secret guy Mom's dating is Dad.</i>

13:48.000 --> 13:49.411
<i>What else is she hiding?</i>

13:49.840 --> 13:52.491
What? What's with that look?

13:53.640 --> 13:54.926
Nothing. Just looking.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.401
Okay, so, keep going. Ronald Reagan...

14:04.480 --> 14:07.768
- Take off your shoes.
- Why? The kids are sleeping.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.680
The floor creaks.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.600
- Like a thief in my own home.
- Ex-home.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.446
You think it's a mistake
I'm seeing my ex-husband again?

14:24.240 --> 14:25.241
Yes?

14:25.800 --> 14:26.801
No?

14:29.120 --> 14:32.363
Could you stop saying...
And just give me a real answer?

14:40.480 --> 14:41.686
Stop it, Ethan!

14:47.400 --> 14:48.401
Jackson!

14:49.120 --> 14:50.121
Stop it.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.330
Jackson, shut up!

14:52.640 --> 14:54.051
Stop it. Shove it up your ass.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.491
Mom, did you hear that?

14:56.160 --> 14:57.571
Lola, language.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.809
Jackson! I'm going to kill you.
I swear to God!

15:03.240 --> 15:06.323
I am so tired of that.
Give it to me. Give it to me.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.161
_Mom!
'You!

15:09.240 --> 15:10.241
Mommy!

15:10.840 --> 15:12.888
Mom, Emily won't let me practice.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.841
It's time for dinner.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.763
<i>Dinner's on the table. You were supposed
to be here a half an hour ago.</i>

15:18.960 --> 15:20.485
Fine, okay. I'm coming back.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.762
- You know your father!
- Okay. Whatever.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.890
Sorry, guys, I gotta bail.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.848
Bail? Dude, we got to practice. Come on.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.002
- No, I'll make it up next time, I promise.
- Make it up?

15:30.360 --> 15:33.011
Bro, we're gonna suck if we don't practice.
Battle of the Bands is coming up.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.764
We're not going to suck, dude.
We're putting in the time.

15:34.840 --> 15:35.841
It's going to be fine, okay?

15:36.760 --> 15:39.411
Dude, these kids practice every day,
all right?

15:39.400 --> 15:40.845
They don't have to go home
when mommy calls.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.041
I'll see you later.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.566
We're so screwed.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.370
All right, come on.
Everybody gets a flyer, okay?

15:49.360 --> 15:51.931
We wanna see you all at the show.
No Shampoo.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.041
Semifinals!

15:56.720 --> 16:00.441
Ladies get in free, come check us out.
No Shampoo. Guys, $10.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.281
Come check them out.

16:02.480 --> 16:06.724
- What kind of music?
- Indie. A little bit of everything.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.449
Well, if you're there, I'm there.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.285
You're passing out flyers now?

16:11.960 --> 16:14.770
Yeah, but apparently, it works better
if you're pretty.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.280
Like you would know.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.641
Don't be jealous.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.842
- Don't worry.
- I never do.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.171
I swear, guys,
if we don't make it through after that...

17:17.160 --> 17:18.445
Oh, my God, you're going to make it.

17:18.560 --> 17:19.846
All right.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.648
- You did so good.
- You think so?

17:21.720 --> 17:23.848
- I know so.
- Thanks.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.648
-"I know so."
-"I know so."

17:25.640 --> 17:27.005
You really are amazing.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.321
No, you're amazing.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.361
Kyle!

17:35.640 --> 17:36.641
You coming?

17:37.320 --> 17:38.731
Yeah, yeah.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.321
Come on.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.124
We're going to rock it next time.

18:04.240 --> 18:05.401
There he is.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.041
So, where you been?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.687
At Chad's. Working on our history project.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.001
How did it go?

18:11.160 --> 18:14.004
It went really great.
It's about the Industrial Revolution.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.361
Hon, want some soup?

18:16.760 --> 18:17.761
Thank you.

18:19.880 --> 18:23.566
So, hey, Dad, remember that
Battle of the Bands thing I told you about?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.443
The winners, they get a record deal.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.123
It's really more of a showcase,
but we might have a spot.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.081
Pass me the salt.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.805
Did you hear what I said?

18:36.120 --> 18:37.770
Yeah. Did you hear what I said?

18:38.480 --> 18:40.403
We'll talk about music
when your grades are better.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.001
Thank you.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.444
Lola, I said no.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.724
I'm on my way home. I'm at the courthouse.

18:59.160 --> 19:03.404
Because I got a ticket. You know what?
Enough with this inquisition.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.925
I'm going to just see you at home.

19:09.240 --> 19:10.287
Oh, shit!

19:10.280 --> 19:11.281
Really?

19:13.640 --> 19:14.641
Need some help?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.724
Not unless you can fix this.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.571
Not exactly my skill set.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.081
- Then too bad.
- Too bad.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.244
- So, where are we going?
- What?

19:25.920 --> 19:28.127
You can't limp home, and I doubt
you'll find a cab this time of day.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.086
Well, they kept me in there forever.
Stupid asshole cops, giving me a ticket.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.921
Just because
my registration's expired one day.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.966
You're not gonna find a cab.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.609
Trust me, I'm a very safe driver.

19:44.920 --> 19:45.921
Okay.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.045
- Need some help?
- Yeah.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.440
Come on. What are you waiting for?

20:03.800 --> 20:07.327
But, hey, what about your helmet?
The cops will just bust you for anything.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.129
Don't worry about it. We'll be okay.

20:10.280 --> 20:11.486
Have a good one, Detective.

20:11.560 --> 20:12.925
You, too, have a good one.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.365
- Ready?
- Yeah.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.570
Let me help you with that.
It gets stuck sometimes.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.641
Okay.

20:51.640 --> 20:56.328
Thanks. I'm sorry I insulted
your entire profession.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.525
It's okay, I'm kind of used to it.

20:59.160 --> 21:00.810
Appreciate the rescue.

21:01.840 --> 21:02.841
Anytime.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.601
Is he hot?

21:08.920 --> 21:10.081
You're so bad.

21:10.680 --> 21:15.402
It doesn't matter, because I'm not gonna
go out with some random cop.

21:15.480 --> 21:18.882
All right, well then, one night.
Quick and dirty. One night.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.360
No, 'cause that's really not my style.

21:21.480 --> 21:22.481
With a guy?

21:22.640 --> 21:24.130
No, the quick and dirty.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.367
Okay, well, you've been divorced
for more than a year.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.089
It's time to step it up. Get your game on.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.162
Let me tell you something,
if I was a divorced woman...

21:31.320 --> 21:32.446
If you were a divorced woman, what?

21:33.400 --> 21:34.890
Nothing. Nothing.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.202
- Nothing.
- Everything.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.729
I'd sleep with a different guy
every single night. Just like you do.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.407
Oh, really?
Well, I haven't slept with anybody but you.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.290
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about men. Men.

21:46.360 --> 21:51.605
You mean us. You mean us men.
The great confederation of bastards.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.045
Hey, look who's here.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.250
- Mom, Jeremy got a scooter.
- Jeremy got a scooter.

21:56.320 --> 21:57.890
Jeremy got a scooter?

21:58.040 --> 21:59.769
- Yeah. Dad said it was cool.
- Surprise!

21:59.760 --> 22:01.649
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I got the kid a scooter.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.285
Wait, excuse me. We discussed this.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.762
I think I should get one, too.
I could avoid being late for school.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.484
- It's not gonna happen.
- Why?

22:08.560 --> 22:10.164
Because I'm not gonna go

22:10.240 --> 22:12.641
and be peeling you up off of the sidewalk
because you've splattered...

22:12.720 --> 22:13.960
That's dramatic.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.563
It's not dramatic. And it's not happening.

22:16.640 --> 22:17.641
Whatever.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.241
Where are you going?

22:19.360 --> 22:21.203
I've got to show Jeremy
something on the computer.

22:21.280 --> 22:22.281
How can you make that decision without...

22:22.400 --> 22:24.846
- I know. But I've set the table.
- We'll come back.

22:24.920 --> 22:27.127
It's just we're not really interested
in the senior conversations.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.121
Yeah. Thanks, Dad.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.287
- What?
- Senior...

22:29.280 --> 22:31.760
We're not interested
in your teenage conversations.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.126
- Senior conversations?
- Are you serious?

22:33.280 --> 22:35.203
- She's so polite.
- I'm dyeing my beard.

22:38.760 --> 22:39.761
What do you think?

22:39.960 --> 22:41.689
Not bad. Who is it?

22:41.880 --> 22:42.881
It's my friend, Kyle.

22:43.760 --> 22:44.966
Okay, Mr. Kyle.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.081
Shut up.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.121
Does Lola smoke?

22:48.400 --> 22:49.401
Are you crazy?

22:50.200 --> 22:52.123
Do you smoke in front of her?

22:52.960 --> 22:55.884
Never. What about Jeremy?

22:56.360 --> 22:58.727
Don't worry about Jeremy. He hates drugs.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.884
I think I'm going to surfing camp.
What about you?

23:03.520 --> 23:05.648
I don't know, but my dad
is totally doing my mom again.

23:06.040 --> 23:08.486
No shit. You cool with that?

23:08.640 --> 23:11.371
No. I'm sick of them lying to me
and I know that it's never going to work.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.161
I know the feeling.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.485
So, I need to ask you a favor.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.564
Okay. What do you need?

23:26.120 --> 23:27.121
I need you to sleep with me.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.366
Now, women don't just screw.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.761
Okay? They need an emotional attachment.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.163
- Do we?
- Though I will say this,

23:38.400 --> 23:41.722
that no matter how liberated
you women think you are,

23:41.720 --> 23:44.803
male sexuality and female sexuality,
very different.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.846
Come on, what's the big deal?
It's not like I asked you for euthanasia.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.684
It's just one little favor.
You've known me forever. Come on.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.681
It's not just a little favor.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.882
Okay. What would you say if I asked you?

23:54.960 --> 23:56.246
Yes.

23:57.280 --> 24:00.284
I say no, okay? I respect you too much.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.168
You guys suck with your stupid respect.

24:03.320 --> 24:06.005
Yeah and when we don't respect you,
we're assholes, and when we do, we suck.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.371
All right, fine, next subject.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.526
Why don't you do it with Mr. Kyle?

24:10.920 --> 24:13.924
Because he thinks I did it already,
and if I ask him,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.731
then he's going to know that I'm lying.
And so will Chad.

24:17.720 --> 24:18.881
You women really are nuts.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.646
We are not nuts.
Since Lucy has broken up with Rick,

24:21.960 --> 24:23.564
she's going out with a ton of guys.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.769
Everybody knows that Lucy is a slut.

24:26.680 --> 24:30.890
She's having the time of her life.
And I doubt anyone's farting in her bed.

24:32.320 --> 24:33.560
I'm so sorry.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.046
You used to love my farts.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.611
I was lying to you.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.251
What about you and Allen?
You guys still see each other?

24:40.400 --> 24:41.765
Just with the kids.

24:42.800 --> 24:46.805
Good, because we saw Allen the other day
with the biggest bimbo.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.207
You should have seen this girl.
Remember her, Roman?

24:49.280 --> 24:52.090
Okay, just because he was with her,
doesn't mean he was "with" her.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.241
Darling...

24:54.760 --> 24:56.364
Doesn't mean anything. Okay?

24:57.440 --> 24:59.329
Oh, shit, did I just say something dumb?

25:01.320 --> 25:02.321
Not at all.

25:03.800 --> 25:04.801
VVhy?

25:07.440 --> 25:08.771
- More pie?
- Yes, please.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.410
- I'd love some. Thanks.
- Yes.

25:24.760 --> 25:25.761
Hey!

25:26.800 --> 25:28.290
Are you seeing someone else?

25:29.320 --> 25:30.321
What?

25:31.360 --> 25:32.361
You heard me.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.481
You mean,

25:37.440 --> 25:41.445
am I sleeping with someone else?

25:41.960 --> 25:42.961
Exactly.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.729
What is wrong with you?

25:47.640 --> 25:50.564
So you're not seeing anyone else
besides me?

25:55.280 --> 25:57.851
I don't know.
I thought we were back together.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.366
Why are you even asking me this?

26:00.440 --> 26:01.566
Are we?

26:12.640 --> 26:13.641
I hate her. Look at her.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.242
- Even her underwear is skankville.
- Totally.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.961
'Cause that is stuff that
they write songs about.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.326
I wish I had her ass, though.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.205
- Come on.
- What?

26:23.280 --> 26:25.282
That ass is a full-time job for her.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.171
You know what,
no matter if I work out and I do anything,

26:28.160 --> 26:29.889
my ass is always going to be flat.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.884
Em? Are those Care Bears on your undies?

26:35.960 --> 26:39.362
Shut up, okay? It's all my mom will buy.
What am I supposed to do about it?

26:39.440 --> 26:41.886
Mom just got a ton of stuff
from Victoria's Secret that doesn't fit.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.325
And she's not gonna return it.
Do you want it?

26:43.520 --> 26:45.124
- Yeah.
- Okay.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.204
Yeah, no, I need something
that Colin's going to like.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.487
Who's Colin?

26:48.560 --> 26:50.244
Mr. Ross. The trig teacher.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.365
- Are you kidding me?
- Nope.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.361
- Don't worry about it.
- You're sick.

26:53.920 --> 26:55.604
- Double. Double. Double.
- You're sick.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.966
- You're sick.
- You're sick.

27:00.680 --> 27:02.842
Emily, Emily, free me.
Come on, I love you, please.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.450
- Okay, go bother somebody else.
- I love you.

27:04.520 --> 27:05.567
No, come on.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.528
- Hey, watch it.
- I was just going for the ball.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.086
Hey, Lola, are you okay?

27:12.160 --> 27:13.924
- Let's go.
- It's not funny. Why are you laughing?

27:14.360 --> 27:16.044
It's always funny when someone falls.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.405
Yo, can we play? Come on.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.484
Walk away. Just ignore him. He's a jerk.

27:25.760 --> 27:27.728
- Stop following me.
- You wish.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.208
- Skank-ass ho.
- Stop calling me that!

27:30.400 --> 27:32.289
Stop calling me that!

27:34.920 --> 27:37.491
- Hey, come on. Leave it.
- You're pretty hot when you're mad.

27:37.560 --> 27:40.245
- Screw you!
- Lola, walk away!

27:40.320 --> 27:42.243
- Just get out of here. Leave it. Come on.
- Are you kidding me?

27:42.240 --> 27:44.004
Come on, come on, leave it. Seriously.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.242
- Lola, stop.
- Come on, come on.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.126
- I can't believe I ever dated you.
- Get off, dude.

27:49.680 --> 27:50.806
Kyle, the hero.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.121
Look, it's not my fault.
He won't quit harassing me.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.247
You wish.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.322
Now you guys are harassing me.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.045
Please don't call my mom.

28:04.280 --> 28:06.681
- Give me your phone.
- No, Mom, please, you can't do that.

28:06.760 --> 28:10.287
Yes, I can. Bad grades are one thing,
but this is unacceptable.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.807
- Mom, I swear it's not my fault.
- Whose fault is it, then?

28:14.400 --> 28:15.401
I don't want to talk about it.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.966
Fine! You don't want to talk about it,
then give me your phone.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.326
I don't have it. It's at Janice's.

28:19.960 --> 28:22.008
It's at Janice's. Mom.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.290
No, Mom! That's not fair!

28:27.280 --> 28:29.965
You want to know what's not fair
is me being called out of a client meeting

28:29.960 --> 28:32.531
-because you started a fight in school.
- It's not my fault.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.967
And you know what, that whole little
Friday night get-together deal is off.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.649
Chad called me a ho, okay?

28:40.200 --> 28:43.568
Do you want me to let it go
and say thank you?

28:44.280 --> 28:45.281
Your Chad?

28:46.160 --> 28:47.650
He's not my Chad any more, Mom.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.007
Why did he call you that?

28:53.120 --> 28:54.360
God, do you have to know everything?

28:56.040 --> 28:58.168
Yeah, I do if you want your phone back.

28:58.480 --> 29:00.164
- That's blackmail, Mom!
- I know.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.884
- Stop.
- And look here.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.570
- You're getting a text from Emily.
- No.

29:03.640 --> 29:06.325
- And she says, "Hey."
- Mom, stop!

29:09.680 --> 29:12.206
Chad slept with somebody else,
so to pretend I was okay with it,

29:12.200 --> 29:13.565
I said that I did, too. Okay?

29:14.720 --> 29:16.563
- Did you?
- No.

29:16.640 --> 29:19.007
Is that all you care about
is if I had sex or not?

29:19.160 --> 29:21.401
No, that is not all that I care about.

29:21.480 --> 29:24.723
I don't want you making stupid mistakes
out of spite.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.284
Baby, I care about you.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.686
I know. I'm sorry, Mom.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.844
Why didn't you talk to me?

29:34.360 --> 29:36.840
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, baby.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.048
Can I have my phone back now?

29:44.800 --> 29:46.131
And have my party on Friday?

29:47.560 --> 29:48.561
Two friends.

29:49.240 --> 29:50.241
Six.

29:50.520 --> 29:51.965
- Four.
- Deal.

31:55.440 --> 31:59.650
<i>"I can't love him, but I do.
I feel so real with him.</i>

31:59.720 --> 32:02.883
<i>"If he figures it out,
it will totally ruin our friendship.</i>

32:02.960 --> 32:05.042
<i>"Okay, I'm just going to have to hide it. "</i>

32:23.440 --> 32:25.044
Hey, Lol?

32:25.120 --> 32:29.364
Maybe we should...
I don't want Chad to get the wrong idea.

32:29.880 --> 32:31.405
He's so jealous.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.084
I don't blame him.

32:34.080 --> 32:37.084
Well, I'm flattered
you still want to hang out with me.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.565
I love hanging out with you

32:40.200 --> 32:41.281
Go.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.328
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- See you later.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.765
Where's my chicken?

33:42.280 --> 33:43.281
Jackson!

33:43.360 --> 33:44.361
My chicken.

33:50.760 --> 33:51.761
Jackson.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.884
- What?
- My chicken. Where is it?

33:55.200 --> 33:56.201
How should I know?

33:57.600 --> 33:59.728
Oh, really? What is that?

33:59.920 --> 34:03.367
- Mom, I swear...
- I will not tolerate lying in my home.

34:09.679 --> 34:10.966
I hate my life.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.324
Wait, where did you say you were going?

34:14.400 --> 34:17.449
It's just a spa weekend with the girls.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.521
What girls?

34:19.440 --> 34:21.647
Actually, you don't know them.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.721
You have friends that I don't know?
Like who?

34:27.600 --> 34:29.648
So, wait, why aren't Emma and Ethan
going with Dad?

34:29.639 --> 34:31.404
Because he's going out of town
this weekend.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.371
- So, Mom...
- Yes, dear.

34:33.360 --> 34:35.010
- You got this covered?
- Yes, dear.

34:35.080 --> 34:38.004
- She gets to have three friends.
- Only three. I mean it.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.525
- And pizza.
- Only pizza. That's it.

34:40.679 --> 34:41.726
I kind of want Chinese.

34:41.719 --> 34:44.849
And don't let them sweet-talk you,
because they are ruthless.

34:44.920 --> 34:48.003
- Me?
- Really? What a surprise! Chinese it is.

34:48.159 --> 34:50.606
- Okay, here you go.
- Here's your bag.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.161
Are you guys trying to get rid of me?

34:54.239 --> 34:55.366
- No.
- Yes.

34:55.840 --> 34:57.001
- Bye.
'BYE-bye.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.003
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.401
- Party time.
- No way. Three friends.

35:02.480 --> 35:03.527
- Come on.
- Maybe five.

35:03.640 --> 35:04.721
- Come on.
- Just five.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.210
You know when she says three,
she means like 30.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.043
- No, she doesn't.
- Come on. Be cool.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.121
That's as cool as I get.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.881
You knew she was gonna go
spend the weekend with Dad.

35:15.960 --> 35:19.567
Yes, it's so romantic.
They're sneaking around like teenagers.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.167
Unfortunately, teenagers
aren't like that any more.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.170
Oh, sweet pea.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.010
They're so cute.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.686
I guess so.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.403
- So, do you play basketball?
- Yeah, I play a lot.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.002
- How tall are you?
- I'm about 6'2...

35:48.120 --> 35:50.248
Excuse me, ma'am.
Would you like something to drink?

35:50.360 --> 35:53.170
Thank you, honey.
I'll have a Coke with a little scotch.

35:53.320 --> 35:55.687
Actually, make that a scotch
with a little Coke.

35:56.720 --> 35:57.721
Not so much.

35:57.880 --> 36:00.565
Listen, this is going to help her sleep,
then we're going to party all night.

36:00.920 --> 36:01.921
I'm gonna go to hell.

36:02.600 --> 36:03.601
You're such a chicken.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.643
- Here's your drink.
- Thanks, sweetie.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.767
- So, how is it?
- It's good.

36:12.760 --> 36:13.807
Thank you for making me a drink.

36:15.920 --> 36:19.003
But then she never called me back.
I see you. Where you going?

36:19.200 --> 36:20.929
Wait, I'm going to call you later, all right?

36:20.920 --> 36:21.921
See you, Wen.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.047
Wen, Wen, is that your T-shirt?

36:25.760 --> 36:27.000
I don't know.

36:27.920 --> 36:28.921
Okay, shut up.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.728
No, but is it vintage?

36:33.200 --> 36:35.646
- Is it vintage?
- Or is it new?

36:35.640 --> 36:36.687
- I don't know.
- Are there a lot of them?

36:36.760 --> 36:38.569
Did you borrow it from somebody else?

36:38.720 --> 36:40.165
No, no, it's neither.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.730
Oh, dear God! Okay...

36:43.440 --> 36:45.886
I'm just... Okay.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.328
- I'm gonna go.
- Are you all right?

37:07.320 --> 37:10.483
- I really want to kiss you.
- Me too.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.450
Let's party, yeah!

38:11.200 --> 38:14.409
<i>Friendship is not that easy to turn into love.</i>

38:14.520 --> 38:18.889
<i>Good news, we laughed a lot,
and I just think we both weren't ready.</i>

38:18.960 --> 38:21.930
<i>But still, it was a perfect night.</i>

38:22.440 --> 38:23.521
<i>Bad news?</i>

38:24.720 --> 38:30.682
<i>Mom left Dad again and she came home
a little bit earlier than I expected.</i>

38:34.520 --> 38:35.601
Lola!

38:39.600 --> 38:41.125
Honey, I'll help you with the garbage.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.965
Thanks, Mom, you've done enough.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.081
Hey, Mom.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.811
What first, joints or condoms?

38:51.800 --> 38:54.246
- It wasn't me.
- That's not funny, Mom.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.729
- I can explain.
- I would so love for you to explain.

38:58.040 --> 39:00.850
- I know that this looks bad.
- It looks really bad.

39:00.920 --> 39:02.763
Mom, I had no idea
that these people were coming.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.968
I just had my friends.
People from school showed up.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.407
- I don't know how this happened.
- Mom, how could you let this happen?

39:07.480 --> 39:11.087
Honey, I just don't know.
I can't seem to hold my drinks like I used to.

39:12.760 --> 39:13.761
And what about this?

39:14.560 --> 39:17.803
I wasn't smoking. I don't smoke. Mom!

39:17.920 --> 39:21.288
If I ever catch you with this again,
I am shipping you off to your dad's! Got it?

39:21.360 --> 39:23.124
That would be a dream, huh, Mom?

39:23.200 --> 39:25.328
And don't worry,
I'll see you there in the morning.

39:27.960 --> 39:31.681
Your Paris trip is off. And you're gonna
come back and clean this mess!

39:33.680 --> 39:36.206
<i>"I can't believe I screwed things up this bad.</i>

39:36.440 --> 39:39.967
<i>"Why can't I rewind in real life?
What a mess!"</i>

39:42.240 --> 39:45.801
Lloyd, get your lazy ass over here
so we can rehearse, man. Call me back.

39:47.880 --> 39:48.881
He's not even picking up.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.521
So, how was the party?

39:54.280 --> 39:56.965
It was okay.

39:59.480 --> 40:00.481
Do anything fun?

40:01.640 --> 40:03.085
Well, you know, the grandma was there.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.129
Why is Lola vacuuming, Mom?

40:20.200 --> 40:21.201
Ask her.

41:06.520 --> 41:07.521
Anne.

41:08.480 --> 41:09.606
What do you want?

41:09.680 --> 41:11.728
Would love for us to stop fighting
over nothing.

41:12.120 --> 41:16.170
Nothing? You call sleeping
with random sluts nothing?

41:16.240 --> 41:18.891
<i>- Anne. ..
- I can't... I can't do this.</i>

41:18.960 --> 41:22.123
You know what? You are the best thing
in my life and you are also the worst.

41:22.200 --> 41:25.522
- Anne, I swear, I never slept with any...
- Stop swearing.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.729
And more importantly,
will you stop lying to me? All of you.

41:29.520 --> 41:32.763
<i>I think we just need to stick
to being what we're meant to be.</i>

41:32.760 --> 41:33.921
Which is?

41:34.160 --> 41:35.650
Parents to our kids.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.330
- I got to go.
- Anne, please don't...

41:56.600 --> 41:58.204
This is gonna be good.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.646
Wow. Your sister is hot. Hi, I'm Chad.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.130
She's not my sister.

42:04.200 --> 42:05.804
Actually, I'm her step-mother.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.769
And she's my wife, pal.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.971
Settle down, please. Quiet, please.

42:13.080 --> 42:14.366
Quiet!

42:14.440 --> 42:17.284
Welcome, parents and students.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.691
Hello.

42:18.760 --> 42:20.649
- Oh, my gosh. He's so cute.
- Check him out.

42:20.640 --> 42:23.689
We have a detective
from the Narcotics Division

42:23.760 --> 42:25.444
of the Chicago Police Department.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.485
He's here to talk to you today.

42:27.560 --> 42:30.564
So, please,
give him your undivided attention.

42:30.680 --> 42:32.284
He's got my attention.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.004
What?

42:35.000 --> 42:37.526
Settle... Please, please, be quiet.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.647
I'm sure you all have something better to do

42:42.640 --> 42:46.087
than sit here and listen to some guy
who thinks he's cool and educational.

42:46.160 --> 42:47.650
Yeah!

42:48.120 --> 42:49.360
I hear you, I hear you.

42:49.440 --> 42:51.363
But there's some facts
I need to arm you with.

42:51.440 --> 42:54.364
I have a picture
that shows the detrimental effects

42:54.480 --> 42:56.847
of long-term drug abuse. Take a look.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.165
Now that I have your attention,

43:05.160 --> 43:08.482
I want to show you
the real effects of THC on the brain.

43:08.560 --> 43:12.326
THC is the agent in pot that causes
the high in so-called "soft" drugs.

43:13.200 --> 43:16.807
You look at this image, it's pretty clear
it's not so soft any more, is it?

43:17.520 --> 43:21.570
Symptoms of cannabis
can range from paranoia to panic attacks,

43:21.640 --> 43:23.244
to symptoms of schizophrenia.

43:23.800 --> 43:25.450
- That was a very good talk.
- I know.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.204
- I hope some of that sticks into your head.
- Okay.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.247
Why are you running?

43:28.320 --> 43:31.210
Because there's someone
that I'd like to avoid.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.520
- There's Janice. I got to go.
- No, no.

43:32.520 --> 43:34.522
- We need to get... We need to get going.
- Hey.

43:34.520 --> 43:36.966
- How you doing?
- Hey, how are you?

43:37.040 --> 43:38.166
Good. How is the heel?

43:38.600 --> 43:41.365
The heel is fine.

43:41.440 --> 43:44.523
Once is coincidence.
Twice, I'm going to have to call that fate.

43:44.880 --> 43:46.370
Is that what you call it?

43:46.440 --> 43:48.727
- Does she know him?
- Oh, God, I hope not.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.289
I think he's going to handcuff your mom
to your bed.

43:51.360 --> 43:54.569
Shut up, shut up. Don't say that.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.608
- Are you coming tonight?
- I'll try, but I'm grounded.

43:57.400 --> 43:59.289
- Your artwork?
- Hey, look, look, look.

43:59.280 --> 44:01.282
- She's up to no good. I told you.
- Really?

44:01.280 --> 44:02.850
She's disgusting. I don't get it.

44:03.080 --> 44:07.563
You know, that was so great, to the...
The talk in there. I...

44:07.640 --> 44:08.880
I'm gonna buy you a drink.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.644
L.-

44:12.320 --> 44:14.687
It wasn't a question.
I'm telling you I'm gonna buy you a drink.

44:17.040 --> 44:20.089
Mom. Can I go to Janice's house?
Just to do homework.

44:20.160 --> 44:21.491
Lola, this is...

44:21.560 --> 44:22.607
- James.
- Hey.

44:22.720 --> 44:24.245
- My daughter, Lola.
- Mom, can I go?

44:24.880 --> 44:26.450
No, you have to do your homework at home.

44:26.440 --> 44:27.601
- This isn't fair.
- What was that?

44:27.680 --> 44:29.682
Nothing. Love you, Mom.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.000
I'll see you at home.

44:33.240 --> 44:34.526
Charming.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.166
You ready for a drink?

44:37.640 --> 44:40.484
- I thought it wasn't a question.
- It's not.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.488
- Okay. This... All right.
- Yeah.

44:45.920 --> 44:48.082
- Have you seen Kyle?
- Yeah, he's in the bathroom.

44:56.680 --> 44:58.125
Hey...

45:13.560 --> 45:15.050
So how was it?

45:16.160 --> 45:18.686
- It was awesome.
- You're disgusting.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.370
- Was it good?
- What do you mean?

45:23.120 --> 45:25.726
Come on, don't lie to me. Just own up to it.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.810
Hey, Lol. What's going on?
What did you tell her?

45:29.800 --> 45:33.521
Nothing. It's not my fault
your little groupie can't take a joke.

45:34.080 --> 45:37.482
Hey, Lol, wait up! Hey, Lol, stop. Please.

45:46.600 --> 45:48.329
I need to go.

45:48.320 --> 45:51.005
- I knew that. Come here.
- Okay, Wen. Stop it. Okay?

45:51.000 --> 45:54.209
- What are you doing?
- What just happened never happened

45:54.280 --> 45:55.406
Got it?

45:55.520 --> 45:57.204
- You're funny.
- No, I'm serious, okay?

45:57.320 --> 46:01.041
Take this. Wait five minutes. I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding. Wait.

46:01.120 --> 46:03.691
What happened? What did I do?

46:13.280 --> 46:14.930
Get in!

46:15.600 --> 46:17.967
- Hey, Lol, wait up!
- Leave me alone.

46:18.040 --> 46:21.522
What did Ashley say to you?
What did she say to you?

46:21.520 --> 46:22.806
- Kyle, don't play dumb.
- No, seriously.

46:22.880 --> 46:24.564
What's wrong? Come on.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.529
- Don't act like you don't know.
- Hey, Lol, what's your deal?

46:26.600 --> 46:30.241
My deal is that everybody knows
she does guys in the bathroom, Kyle.

46:31.040 --> 46:33.725
Wait. What? You think Ashley and I...

46:34.040 --> 46:35.451
In the bathroom?

46:35.560 --> 46:37.369
Well, at least you can get it on
with someone.

46:37.560 --> 46:38.800
Congratulations.

46:40.560 --> 46:43.086
Wow! I guess we're done.

46:55.520 --> 46:56.601
Lola?

47:00.000 --> 47:03.049
Lola? Sweetie, what is it? What's wrong?

47:04.520 --> 47:06.124
Nothing.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.327
Come on, have something to eat.

47:08.400 --> 47:09.765
It's good to eat when you're sad.

47:10.520 --> 47:12.329
What would you like?
What would taste good?

47:12.400 --> 47:14.084
Nothing right now.

47:15.200 --> 47:17.885
You're not going to turn anorexic now,
are you?

47:18.560 --> 47:20.881
Not from skipping one meal.

47:22.600 --> 47:25.922
No, I saw something on TV.
It goes pretty fast.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.810
- It's not what it is.
- I know.

47:31.760 --> 47:34.127
Nobody's worth your tears, baby.

47:35.840 --> 47:37.490
I'm gonna get you some soup.

47:37.560 --> 47:38.800
Okay. I love you.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.851
No, I saw him.
He was in there with the Post-it.

48:32.920 --> 48:34.046
When?

48:34.040 --> 48:36.361
After that drug assembly thing.

48:36.360 --> 48:38.681
Okay, are you absolutely positive
that it was them?

48:38.680 --> 48:41.809
Yes. Yes. I saw that stupid bag. No offense.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.006
No, it's fine.

48:44.320 --> 48:47.688
Hey, girl! High-five it. Girl, I'll see you...

48:49.080 --> 48:50.605
Here they are.

48:51.680 --> 48:52.806
Shit.

49:00.600 --> 49:02.090
<i>"What's wrong with me?</i>

49:02.160 --> 49:04.970
<i>"Do I have a sign on my head
that says 'Cheat on me'?</i>

49:05.040 --> 49:09.045
<i>"I mean, no surprise from Ashley, but Kyle?</i>

49:09.040 --> 49:11.646
<i>"And since bad things come in threes..."</i>

49:19.360 --> 49:21.931
You know what this report smells like?

49:22.000 --> 49:23.081
What?

49:25.200 --> 49:27.806
No more music. Merry Christmas.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.484
Merry Christmas to you, too.

49:42.880 --> 49:45.121
The most important thing
is that you're pretty.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.851
You'll get a rich husband.

49:48.120 --> 49:49.246
Great.

49:49.440 --> 49:51.249
Last year, you were on the honor roll.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.165
Mom, it's only one B.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.602
That's exactly my point.

49:57.400 --> 50:01.689
A B in math, a C in history, a D in biology?

50:02.040 --> 50:03.610
Lola, what are you thinking?

50:03.680 --> 50:06.081
<i>I'm not thinking anything, Mom.</i>

50:06.160 --> 50:08.970
<i>Because I don't care
about the population of China</i>

50:09.040 --> 50:11.247
<i>or the division of cells.</i>

50:11.240 --> 50:12.605
<i>The only thing I care about,</i>

50:12.680 --> 50:15.809
<i>the only thing that hurts,
is Kyle and the Post-it.</i>

50:15.880 --> 50:18.690
<i>And howl want to hurt them
as much as they hurt me.</i>

50:25.080 --> 50:27.686
So, who's the guy
we're supposed to make jealous?

50:27.760 --> 50:29.046
The emo one next to the slut.

50:29.600 --> 50:31.443
Nice hair. What a dork.

50:31.680 --> 50:34.445
Come on, he's not that bad.
Shut up and make it look sexy.

50:34.440 --> 50:35.805
Okay.

50:37.240 --> 50:39.447
- Like only you can.
- Yeah, it's true.

50:39.440 --> 50:41.442
- No. I'm not talking...
- Who needs a girl?

50:41.520 --> 50:42.681
- Come on.
- Hey, who is that guy?

50:43.480 --> 50:46.529
- Who's that guy?
- Jeremy. He's cool. Why?

50:47.160 --> 50:48.321
Nothing.

50:50.520 --> 50:53.000
I mean, who drives a stupid red Vespa
in the middle of winter?

50:53.080 --> 50:55.765
- Why do you care?
- Yeah, why do you care?

50:55.880 --> 50:57.882
I don't care. Come on, let's go.

51:03.720 --> 51:05.051
She de-friended me?

51:27.720 --> 51:28.721
Thank you.

51:30.240 --> 51:32.208
So, how's Jeremy?

51:32.200 --> 51:33.201
How's Ashley?

51:33.280 --> 51:34.691
You know I'm not seeing Ashley.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.086
- Can we talk?
- Okay.

51:36.400 --> 51:39.847
No, in private. At your house at 7:00?

51:39.960 --> 51:41.041
Okay.

51:41.440 --> 51:42.680
Okay.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.364
I called you, but you didn't come.

51:45.440 --> 51:46.726
Come on, come here.

51:46.800 --> 51:47.847
Who is it?

51:47.840 --> 51:49.046
It's Ashley.

51:49.400 --> 51:51.050
Why'd you call her over, man?

51:51.320 --> 51:52.651
Hey, boys.

51:53.760 --> 51:55.285
<i>H€Y-</i>

51:55.640 --> 51:56.687
Oh, God,

51:56.800 --> 51:59.451
she just always shows up everywhere.

51:59.520 --> 52:01.045
She's like a bad dream.

52:01.120 --> 52:03.088
You just can't wake up from it.

52:03.160 --> 52:04.400
Jesus.

52:05.240 --> 52:06.730
<i>I deal with kids every day.</i>

52:06.800 --> 52:08.609
I know the difference
between a kid in trouble

52:08.680 --> 52:09.727
and a kid testing the limits,

52:09.720 --> 52:12.803
and she sounds really normal.

52:12.880 --> 52:13.961
Don't feel guilty.

52:14.040 --> 52:15.883
With kids, it's always guilt.

52:15.880 --> 52:17.405
If I'm too lenient, I'm guilty.

52:18.160 --> 52:21.323
If I yell, it's even worse.

52:21.480 --> 52:23.687
And then it's like I'm a cop in my own home.

52:23.880 --> 52:25.120
That must be awful.

52:27.960 --> 52:30.088
I keep insulting your profession.

52:31.960 --> 52:34.566
The thing is I'm the one
who is always saying

52:34.640 --> 52:36.449
that a woman should have the same rights

52:36.440 --> 52:39.250
and should be able to enjoy sex
the same way a man does.

52:39.240 --> 52:40.605
I couldn't agree more.

52:41.320 --> 52:42.401
You know what I mean.

52:42.480 --> 52:43.606
I know what you mean.

52:43.720 --> 52:46.166
But it's my little girl.

52:46.240 --> 52:50.290
And now that she's starting
to live life as a liberated woman,

52:50.280 --> 52:52.282
I just don't know if I feel the same.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.967
And I don't even know
what to do about Paris.

52:55.240 --> 52:58.369
I am so confused.
I don't even know what to believe.

52:59.080 --> 53:00.684
It's a school trip.

53:00.800 --> 53:03.087
You should let her go to Paris.

53:07.920 --> 53:11.447
Are you saying this to reassure me,
or is that what you really think?

53:11.920 --> 53:14.082
I think you think too much.

53:18.640 --> 53:22.690
Hey, Lol, it's me.
I'll be there in 10 minutes. Okay.

53:29.640 --> 53:32.291
- Where do you think you're going?
- To Chad's. Excuse me...

53:32.280 --> 53:36.046
Are you that stupid
that you bring pot into my house?

53:36.200 --> 53:37.645
- Oh, please.
- Oh, please?

53:37.800 --> 53:38.961
Did you say, "Oh, please"?

53:39.040 --> 53:41.327
How about, oh, please,
wave goodbye to all this

53:41.400 --> 53:43.528
'cause next year, it's military school.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.851
Oh, you think that's funny?

53:44.840 --> 53:47.411
- Get your hands off my guitar!
- It's my guitar!

53:47.480 --> 53:50.324
Dad, no! What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

53:50.520 --> 53:53.046
No more phone! No more computer!

53:58.320 --> 54:00.926
Hey, Kyle. It's Lola. Remember me?

54:01.240 --> 54:04.164
Whatever. I've been waiting here for an hour.
I'm not an idiot.

54:04.160 --> 54:05.764
Don't ever talk to me again, okay?

54:15.240 --> 54:19.768
Thank you for listening to my meltdown.
It really helped.

54:20.240 --> 54:22.208
It's all part of the job, ma'am.

54:22.320 --> 54:24.448
- It was really nice.
- It was nice.

54:33.160 --> 54:34.400
What are you doing here?

54:36.080 --> 54:38.128
Allen, James...

54:38.600 --> 54:41.046
Allen's the father of my children.

54:42.200 --> 54:43.850
Lola,

54:46.040 --> 54:48.088
she forgot her books in my...

54:48.160 --> 54:50.527
I signed the little permission slip for Paris.

54:50.640 --> 54:52.688
We needed to talk about that.

54:52.800 --> 54:55.041
Should we talk about this now?

54:55.120 --> 54:56.281
Allen.

54:56.520 --> 54:58.090
That's a nice dress.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.401
Night.

55:13.120 --> 55:14.406
You Okay?

55:14.560 --> 55:15.641
Yeah.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.287
I guess I should let you feel guilty in peace.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.403
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

55:30.560 --> 55:32.005
Good night.

55:32.360 --> 55:33.771
Good night.

55:59.200 --> 56:00.406
Yummy.

56:07.440 --> 56:09.124
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, God. You okay?

56:09.200 --> 56:10.645
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, Mr. Ross.

56:11.040 --> 56:13.646
I didn't see you there, I'm sorry.
How are you?

56:13.840 --> 56:16.286
Good, good. Just grocery shopping.

56:16.640 --> 56:18.290
Yeah, me too.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.247
Wow, healthy.

56:21.480 --> 56:22.845
Do you cook a lot?

56:23.120 --> 56:24.246
Yeah, I love to cook.

56:24.920 --> 56:25.967
I love to cook.

56:26.560 --> 56:28.562
I cook all the time.

56:28.960 --> 56:31.884
Emily, did you find the milk?

56:32.080 --> 56:34.481
No, it's not that way.

56:35.200 --> 56:37.851
- But this is my trig teacher, Mr. Ross.
- How are you doing?

56:37.840 --> 56:39.205
- This is my mom.
- Hello.

56:39.200 --> 56:40.850
And my brother.

56:41.040 --> 56:42.201
<i>H€Y-</i>

56:42.480 --> 56:46.530
I'm sorry about the home tutoring thing.
I just was already booked up this semester.

56:46.520 --> 56:48.522
Home tutoring for Emily?

56:48.600 --> 56:49.601
Yeah.

56:51.320 --> 56:53.322
No. No, no, sorry.

56:54.520 --> 56:57.171
My fault. I must've gotten her mixed up
with some other student.

56:57.600 --> 57:01.127
Well, teachers should keep their
minds sharpened, shouldn't they? Come on.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.131
- Emily.
- Yeah, no...

57:03.480 --> 57:05.084
Nice meeting you.

57:05.960 --> 57:07.883
Since when do teachers look like that?

57:08.040 --> 57:09.246
Yeah, right?

57:13.480 --> 57:16.086
So, he does his own grocery shopping,
which means he's totally single.

57:16.240 --> 57:18.368
<i>So? You're not going to be
sleeping with your teacher, Em.</i>

57:18.680 --> 57:19.727
Yeah, says who?

57:22.480 --> 57:25.290
Is something wrong with you?
You seem kind of...

57:25.400 --> 57:27.402
I can't quit thinking about Kyle and Ashley.

57:34.520 --> 57:36.284
Lola, it was me, okay?

57:36.960 --> 57:38.007
It was you what?

57:38.120 --> 57:40.805
<i>It wasn't the Post-it and it wasn't Kyle.
It was me.</i>

57:40.960 --> 57:42.405
In the boys' bathroom.

57:42.400 --> 57:45.131
You didn't see her purse. You saw mine.

57:47.200 --> 57:49.771
- Wait, you and Kyle?
- No!

57:49.880 --> 57:52.929
<i>I want to tell you who, but I can't.
Believe me.</i>

57:53.000 --> 57:56.891
Okay, it was just a onetime thing.
I wanted to just get it over with.

57:56.960 --> 57:59.247
So that I would be ready for Mr. Ross
when he was ready.

57:59.360 --> 58:00.407
<i>You know?</i>

58:00.400 --> 58:01.731
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

58:01.800 --> 58:02.926
I wanted to tell you,

58:02.920 --> 58:05.890
but then you did the whole, like,
"Who does it in the boys' bathroom?

58:06.000 --> 58:07.161
"She's a ho!"

58:07.320 --> 58:09.243
Me and Kyle broke up because of this.

58:09.320 --> 58:10.560
Look, I'm really sorry.

58:10.560 --> 58:13.769
I cannot believe you did that.
I can't talk to you right now. I'm sorry.

58:17.440 --> 58:18.566
Okay.

58:33.120 --> 58:35.851
Wow, you're back early for a change.

58:36.960 --> 58:39.930
Wow, look at you doing homework
for a change.

58:44.560 --> 58:46.130
Answer me.

59:07.240 --> 59:10.562
So, about this trip to Paris?

59:11.200 --> 59:12.486
Yes?

59:14.400 --> 59:16.641
Are all your friends going?

59:18.240 --> 59:19.321
Yes.

59:22.800 --> 59:26.407
And if I were to let you go,
would you promise...

59:26.480 --> 59:28.881
Oh, my God.
I promise, I will be so good, Mom.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.924
Please, please, please, please, Mom.
Please, please.

59:32.040 --> 59:33.644
Is that a yes?

59:34.680 --> 59:36.489
Yes, yes! Thank you so much!

59:38.640 --> 59:41.291
Mom, it's not the jungle. It's Paris

59:41.840 --> 59:44.525
This is what I gave you last time for cramps.

59:44.640 --> 59:47.371
Should I write cramps on it?
Think you'll remember?

59:47.440 --> 59:49.010
I have a brain.

59:50.080 --> 59:51.241
Good for you, angel.

59:51.320 --> 59:53.641
- I'm gonna go pack.
- Good for you.

59:55.760 --> 59:57.171
I found it, sweetie.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.806
Oh, nice. All right, conservative.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.887
What is this? An eye patch?

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.881
No, it's Lola's.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.246
She left it here when she spent the night.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.401
I just have to give it back to her.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.165
Oh, really? How many nights
did she spend here? Eighty?

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.680
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.047
- No, I don't think you're...
- You haven't even left yet,

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.042
and if I find any more of these,
you're not going anywhere!

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.051
These are for bad girls with bad grades
and no futures!

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.162
This is garbage! Garbage!

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.689
You promise you're going
to be careful, right?

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.091
Why do you keep asking me that?

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.921
I really don't feel comfortable with you
staying with a family that I don't know.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.082
Mom, they're French.
They're probably stricter than you.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.207
Okay.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.808
So I have a little something for you,
just to add to your collection.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.008
I love it. Thank you so much.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.640
It's so cute. Thank you, Mom.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.290
- You're welcome.
- I love you.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.724
- Let me put it on.
- Yeah.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.281
It's so cute.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.964
You promise, right? To be careful?

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.964
- I promise. Stop asking.
- Okay.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.565
- No, no.
- What?

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.641
- No. No.
- Mom!

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.921
Mom, I don't have any warm sweaters.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.690
You have a ton.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.603
They're all scratchy. This one is soft.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.523
Yeah, well, six-ply cashmere, it better be.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.921
- Mom, please. Please, Mommy.
- No. No.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.241
Mommy, I'm going to be cold,
and when I wear it, I'll think of you

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.004
and how much you love me
and how much I love you

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.525
and how much I miss you, Mom. Please.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.841
Please. It's my favorite...

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.003
You are such a pain in the ass.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.760
Unbelievable.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.047
- Do not stretch this out.
- I won't.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.168
I'm gonna get some water.
Do you want some?

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.208
I'm good, thank you.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.725
Are we cool, Lola?

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.644
Yeah, we're cool.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.123
Look, I can just go talk
to him right now, okay?

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.451
It's fine.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.606
All right. I'm gonna get some water.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.846
Hey, what's the matter?

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.611
She's still mad at me. I'm getting water.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.161
<i>H€Y-</i>

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.760
Mrs. Chandler, where are we?
This is terrible.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.170
Come on, we're here.
There are your families.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.451
Come on. Get down quickly, girls!

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.249
Okay, where is the Eiffel Tower?

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.925
- Oh, my God.
- Is that sheep?

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.129
Mrs. Chandler, can I go home?

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.726
When you said we were going to Paris,
what did you mean?

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.804
We're only 20 minutes away. Okay?

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.683
This is a way to say hello.
It's a French hello.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.760
What's up?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.970
Dude, I've seen this in a horror film.
It does not end well.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.122
- We got to get out of here.
- Don't discriminate, bro.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.090
Discriminate? Are you kidding me?
Don't say that to me.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.446
Oh, my God. I need a hotel now.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.201
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.966
Hello.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.011
Oh, great.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.526
I miss you, too.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.760
It's nice here.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.047
Welcome to the psych ward.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.009
Okay, Mom, I gotta go.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.243
My battery's about to die
and I got to find an adapter, okay?

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.526
They don't have one.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.449
This family is so weird.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.723
<i>- Love you.
- Okay,</i> bye.

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.849
She said her family is weird.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.371
I knew that I shouldn't let her go.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.727
- Why are they weird?
- They're not weird. They're French.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.246
And how could I forget
to send her with an adapter?

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.522
Well, you've given her life, that's enough.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.207
- You know what? I have to go.
- Where are you going?

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.527
You know what?
Do you guys have homework?

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.648
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I thought so. Let's get on it.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.891
So, do you like him?

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.611
'Who?
'Who?

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.930
- Starsky.
- Mom, would you not call him that?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.126
And I haven't even thought about it.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.803
Don't bullshit me, dear.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.370
I haven't. Really.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.569
I just hate it when everyone
acts like your life is over

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.766
if you don't have a man.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.088
There's nothing wrong with
getting back on the horse, you know.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.566
So, where is he taking you?

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.564
Mom, would you quit asking me questions?

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.808
You don't have to know everything.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.247
How do I look?

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.883
You look adorable.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.204
Now, don't forget to take a sweater

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.683
and other things to protect yourself.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.930
- Mom!
- I mean it.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.208
She's like Mom with Lola.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:33.006
Hey, come on. What about that homework?

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.162
Let's get on it, chop, chop, chop.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.401
Have fun.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.530
That thing is so creepy.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.648
- Oh, my God, it is so cold in here.
- I know.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.567
What? French people don't have heat?

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.442
- No, it's just these creepy Joan of Arc fans.
- Why?

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.684
Because she was burned at the stake!

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.768
Lola, why are you still mad at me?

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:10.810
Because I would never do to you
what you did to me.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.610
Yeah, but you don't really even
know what happened,

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.966
and if you knew, you would not be upset.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.325
'Cause you won't tell me!

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.208
Okay, but if I tell you,

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.523
do you promise that you won't tell anybody
and you won't laugh at me?

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.161
Promise.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.485
- You swear? Okay.
- Swear! Come on.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.290
- What?
- Oh, God!

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.368
- Come on, tell me.
- Oh, my God! I can't.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.801
It was Wen.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.641
You said you wouldn't laugh!

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.570
- You said you wouldn't laugh.
- Okay, I get why you lied.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.889
So, James, what do you do for a living?

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:36.645
I'm a cop.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.721
- Narcotics.
- Take that.

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:44.124
Just breathe. Take it easy.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.202
I only smoke because of my sciatica.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.683
- Sciatica?
- He is so full of it.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.728
- No, I'm not.
- No, sweetheart, it's okay.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.201
He's a cop!

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.601
Stop.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.330
No,no,no,no.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.281
Okay.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.121
Lola?

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.361
Lola?

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.765
Oh, my God!

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.202
You're a genius. Nice muscles.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.401
We're going to go to bed.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.564
- Thanks, man. You're great.
- Screw you. This is the second time.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.881
Deaf-mute.

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:57.685
- Why is it so complicated in Chicago?
- I don't know.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.688
It's not complicated here.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.921
- Hey, Lol.
- Yeah?

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.127
Can you do me a favor?

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.090
Can you keep my guitar back in Chicago?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.729
You're the only person I can trust.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.201
Sure.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.444
- Can I tell you something?
- What?

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.410
It's actually my first time.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.042
It's my first time since my divorce.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.330
<i>It's so good to love someone
so much it hurts.</i>

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.440
<i>I don't know how people survive this.</i>

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.488
<i>Honestly, I don't.</i>

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.962
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:38.604
How did it go? I want the scoop.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.923
- What scoop?
- On Paris.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.730
It was cool.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.970
Okay, well, what did you do?

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:51.845
School stuff. It was like, the Eiffel Tower,
which is beautiful.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.567
And learned some French.
It was nothing special.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.401
What about you?

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.325
- Me?
- Yeah, what did you do?

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:03.606
Really nothing special.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.485
Okay, are you scared?

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.324
Well, if he kisses you on the lips,
it means he's cool being your boyfriend.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.845
If not, forget it.

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.131
<i>H€Y-</i>

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.490
What are you doing?

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.525
Okay, yeah.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.689
- Okay. No. Come on.
- I love you.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.609
<i>So, is your old man
going to let you play the gig?</i>

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.602
Or are we going to have to tunnel you out?

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.643
Are you kidding?
There's no way I'm going to let my dad ruin

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.846
our chance at getting signed.

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.285
This is huge, right?

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:44.045
I mean, it's like the biggest chance
we have, dude.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.965
Maybe your parents could adopt me.

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.481
Yeah, but then my brother

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.721
could be hooking up with my ex-girlfriend
in my own house.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.528
Look, man, about that.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.727
- You just got to get over it.
- It's cool.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:05.164
Look, just keep it real with me,
and we'll be cool.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.684
I mean, we're like brothers, right?

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.645
This is so awesome.

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.161
You're a sociopath.

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.768
Okay, no, I'm not doing this.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.888
How many pigs had to die for this class?

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.561
Where's PETA?

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.569
What do you think
they test all your ho makeup on?

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.731
Stop calling every girl a ho.
It's getting old, okay?

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.643
- Yeah, whatever, ho.
- Thank you.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.361
Welcome.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.841
Yeah, it comes from the heart.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:48.048
- Oh, my God.
- That is so gross!

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.689
Kyle, stop!

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.568
Are you kidding me
with this room right now, Lola?

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.245
It is a pigsty

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.366
<i>All right, will you get out of my stuff?</i>

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.930
<i>You're never going to find
anything in there anyway.</i>

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.810
Well, if I can't find my sweater, then
you're losing your computer for a month.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.689
<i>All right. Love you, Mom, love you, Mom.</i>

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.768
<i>"Emily's lie totally worked,</i>

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.049
<i>"and I finally got to have sex with Kyle.
Sex with Kyle. "</i>

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.924
This is the worst thing
you can do to your child, isn't it?

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.570
To betray their secrets.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.730
I feel terrible.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.731
So tell her.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.971
- What?
- All of it.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:00.610
That you found her diary.
That you know everything. Tell her.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.321
But she would never forgive me.

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.121
Hello.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.171
So, you wanted to talk?

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:34.966
I'm listening.

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.810
Yes, I want to talk about Lola.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.565
Did you order?

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.805
Don't you start.

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.005
- What?
- I have a therapist

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:44.684
who says... and it drives me crazy.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.445
Did you tell her how you're doing someone?

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.209
I am not doing anyone.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.487
Oh, I'm sorry, yes. You're right.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.324
It's men who do sluts.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.528
You women are always making love
to incredible gentlemen.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:06.047
Just stop it. This is really not the time.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.209
This is a great time for me.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.891
But I forgot I'm speaking
with Miss Moral High Ground.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.367
Lola's doing drugs.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.681
She's smoking pot.

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.451
She's a mess right now.

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.521
Well.

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:21.681
You are her role model.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.841
Yeah.

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.721
When she hears about your new sex life,
I can't wait for that.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.441
- Hey.
- You're an idiot. An absolute idiot.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.561
Hey...

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.005
I'll see you later.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.201
Come on, let's go!

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.688
- I gotta go.
- Now. We're gonna be late.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.124
- Hello, Anne.
- Hi.

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.564
- Love you.
- Okay.

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.361
That was cold.

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.128
Well, I'm not crazy about you
hanging out with that girl.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.724
That girl is my best friend.
I'll hang out with her if I want to. It's my life

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.885
- What?
- It's my life.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.928
You're my daughter, my responsibility.

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:13.571
And until you turn 18, there's a few things
that I won't tolerate.

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.642
- Really, like what?
- Like messing up your life.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:16.881
I'm not messing up my life.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.645
Smoking pot, drinking alcohol,
sleeping around.

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.290
- What do you call that?
- Where'd you get that?

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:25.245
I read your diary, okay?

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.848
- What? What?
- It was an accident.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.604
I was looking for my sweater and it fell out...

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.409
That is not an accident! It did not fall!

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.447
It was hidden, Mom!

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.010
Well, at least we now know
we're on the same page.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.764
Yeah, you're a liar! Are you kidding?

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.490
You had no right to do that!

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.325
That is my private stuff!

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.726
God, you're a bitch!

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:50.045
Lola! Lola!

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.323
Lola!

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.010
Lola!

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.525
This house needs a man.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:05.247
- What about me?
- Oh, sweetie.

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.249
We just need to talk.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:12.287
- Where are you going?
- To Dad's! Do you mind?

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.649
No, not at all.
I'll even be happy to drive you...

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.960
No! I got it.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.801
Bye.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.641
Come here.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:31.809
My baby. I know. I know, sweetheart.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.327
It'll be okay. She'll come back.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.970
- I was never that bad, was I?
- Well, sometimes you were.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:52.683
I'm putting garlic in the sauce.

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.241
No.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.681
Yes!

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.327
- Emily, it's dinner!
- I'm coming!

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:12.007
Is the image of the J-F-K triangle

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.367
by translation of vector I-D,

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:17.371
the E-A-F triangle or the E-F-J triangle?

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.849
'OkaY- Yes?
- Wen?

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.129
You do know what a vector is, right?

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.687
Yeah, like Hannibal Vector?

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.246
Cute. Look. Are you texting?

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.925
What are you doing? I wasn't even on that...

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.570
Okay. I need you to focus on this.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.369
I told you what a vector is.
You asked what a vector is.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.965
I told you what it is.

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.045
HEY,

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:49.125
I didn't get a chance to thank you
for covering for me at the supermarket.

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.403
Emily, there's no need to thank me.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:57.044
But, Emily, you are a beautiful girl,
and you're also a smart girl.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:01.849
And smart girls don't need lies and tricks
to get what they want out of life.

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.441
You know what I'm saying?

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:08.042
Yeah, totally. Okay.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.966
And also, Wen is very nice. He's a good kid.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:15.045
But maybe you could inspire him
to focus a little bit more on his school work.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.886
- Okay.
- And also the picture on his cell phone.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.241
Get him to change it.

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.120
Yeah. Okay.

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:26.411
Yeah, I'm gonna... I'll do that.
Okay. Good-bye.

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.924
I caught you. You just ate some cream.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.322
- I did.
- I'm going to eat some chocolate.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.209
This doesn't make it my favorite.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.282
See, I like the cream the best.

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.121
I like the chocolate.

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:55.000
Yeah, you're just like your mother.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.450
Complicated?

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.086
VETS'-

- Sorry.
- It's okay. I'm sorry, too.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.603
Battle of the Bands.

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.004
Check it out.

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:13.608
- Battle of the Bands. Finals.
- Battle of the Bands.

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.047
- I'm out.
- That was quick.

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.010
I don't know. If I go home before the show,
my dad won't let me out.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.884
Wait, you said you had this taken care of.

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.168
You got to figure out something
and we can't go to my house.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:29.370
Okay, well, you guys figure it out
and let me know,

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.521
but I got to go change.

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.371
Got to do something.

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.131
- Foryou?
- Hit me.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.806
Mom? Can I ask you a favor?

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.451
Already? Yes?

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:45.004
It's like... You would be
the best mom in the whole, wide world.

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.605
- What do you want?
- I just have a few friends

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:48.643
that need to do band practice. Come here!

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.004
This is Kyle. You remember Kyle, right?

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.003
- Yes. Hi.
- Nice to meet you again.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.650
He has this show thing.
You're the best. Bye!

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.131
- Thank you.
- Hi!

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.960
You're the best mom in the world.

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:07.961
Kyle!

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.810
That's it. He's done.

<i>We have our results,</i>

<i>Thank you!</i>

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:55.408
<i>This song is for someone

<i>I guess if I've learned anything this year,</i>

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:41.564
<i>it's that you can pretend to be
anyone you want.</i>

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.642
<i>But when it comes to love,</i>

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.160
<i>I mean real love,</i>

<i>the best thing is just be yourself.</i>

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:15.210
