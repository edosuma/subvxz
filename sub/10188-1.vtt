00:26.240 --> 00:31.622
<i>London calling... with Frenchmen</i>
<i>speaking to their countrymen.</i>

01:31.648 --> 01:34.694
Take a look at that! What
a handsome sight...

01:35.194 --> 01:37.363
...the pride of the Third Reich!

01:37.822 --> 01:41.535
The brave sergeant taking
coffee to the beachgunners.

01:42.119 --> 01:47.083
So that's a sample of the
master race! In a pig's eye!

03:32.203 --> 03:36.458
In this darkest hour, in
the gloom of night...

03:36.666 --> 03:38.586
...we must not despair.

03:45.677 --> 03:47.471
For each of us...

03:48.680 --> 03:51.517
...deliverance is coming!

04:19.800 --> 04:23.136
We need mines and obstacles
along the whole coast.

04:23.345 --> 04:26.349
At every beach, on every dune...

04:26.599 --> 04:28.851
...on every rock.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.145
How many have been installed?

04:31.354 --> 04:33.941
Four million, Herr Field Marshal.

04:40.865 --> 04:44.244
The work has completely
exhausted our troops.

04:46.914 --> 04:48.916
Which would your troops rather be...

04:49.125 --> 04:51.168
...exhausted or dead?

04:51.377 --> 04:53.421
Just look at it, gentlemen.

04:53.922 --> 04:55.966
How calm... how peaceful it is.

04:56.383 --> 05:00.053
A strip of water between
England and the Continent...

05:00.262 --> 05:02.265
...between the Allies and us.

05:03.141 --> 05:08.272
But beyond that peaceful
horizon... a monster waits!

05:08.605 --> 05:12.317
A coiled spring of men,
ships and planes...

05:12.735 --> 05:15.655
...straining to be released against us.

05:16.948 --> 05:21.036
But not a single Allied soldier
shall reach the shore.

05:25.875 --> 05:30.297
Whenever or wherever this invasion
may come, gentlemen...

05:31.173 --> 05:35.845
...I shall destroy the enemy
there... at the water's edge!

05:37.096 --> 05:38.639
Believe me, gentlemen.

05:38.848 --> 05:42.311
The first 24 hours of the
invasion will be decisive.

05:42.770 --> 05:47.483
For the Allies as well as the Germans,
it will be the longest day...

05:49.652 --> 05:50.820
...the longest day!

06:25.694 --> 06:28.530
The poem by Verlaine?

06:28.738 --> 06:30.198
Play it back!

06:40.669 --> 06:43.797
<i>Frenchmen speaking to their countrymen.</i>

06:44.966 --> 06:48.803
<i>Here are some personal messages.</i>

06:51.890 --> 06:55.686
<i>"The long sobs of the violins of autumn."</i>

06:56.103 --> 06:57.187
<i>I repeat:</i>

06:57.396 --> 07:01.234
<i>"The long sobs of the violins of autumn."</i>

07:01.735 --> 07:05.364
Have you notified all commands?

07:15.500 --> 07:20.339
If Berlin is right,
when we intercept the second verse...

07:20.590 --> 07:24.844
...it will mean the invasion
will come within 24 hours.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.431
Give me the text of the second verse.

07:43.699 --> 07:47.162
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

07:49.706 --> 07:54.003
We've intercepted hundreds of messages
in the last year... hundreds!

07:54.212 --> 07:57.423
I've ordered alerts again and again.

07:57.632 --> 08:01.678
Why should this poem mean more
than other messages?

08:01.887 --> 08:03.347
Tell me this:

08:03.555 --> 08:08.228
Does it give us any clue as to
where they will land and when?

08:08.436 --> 08:10.814
Of course it doesn't.

08:13.858 --> 08:19.824
How can I maintain discipline if
I keep my troops on the alert...

08:20.282 --> 08:24.746
...just because a pair of nitwits
in Berlin intercept a poem?

08:26.373 --> 08:28.918
No, Blumentritt... no alert!

08:31.003 --> 08:33.339
And especially not in this weather!

08:34.674 --> 08:36.969
- Anything else?
- No, sir.

08:55.197 --> 08:56.783
Good morning, Field Marshal.

08:56.992 --> 08:58.910
- Any news?
- Nothing important.

08:59.119 --> 09:01.913
Fighter bombers hit the Pas-de-
Calais yesterday afternoon.

09:02.122 --> 09:05.460
Nothing much happened
last night... the storm.

09:05.668 --> 09:09.505
That's all I'm interested in
this morning... the storm.

09:09.714 --> 09:15.220
It came from nowhere...
blew my roses to bits.

09:16.472 --> 09:19.100
There are five-foot waves
in the Channel...

09:19.309 --> 09:22.937
...and winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.608
For the month of June...

09:25.858 --> 09:28.360
...it's the worst Channel
storm in 20 years.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.988
My appointment at Berchtesgaden?

09:31.531 --> 09:34.743
General Jodl will see the Führer today...

09:34.951 --> 09:37.704
...and confirm the appointment for you.

09:39.916 --> 09:42.585
Will you still go to Germany as planned?

09:42.794 --> 09:45.422
Can you think of a better time?

09:46.465 --> 09:51.053
The weather is expected to continue
like this for another week.

10:37.148 --> 10:40.067
Snap it up. Jerk the lead.

10:41.069 --> 10:42.529
Snap it up.

10:42.738 --> 10:44.489
Jerk the lead.

10:44.698 --> 10:46.324
Snap it up.

10:46.533 --> 10:47.535
Jerk the lead.

10:47.744 --> 10:50.079
You expect us to eat this slop again?

10:50.329 --> 10:52.165
I don't care what you do with it, mac.

10:52.415 --> 10:54.167
Eat it, throw it out.

10:54.376 --> 10:55.961
I get paid for cooking it.

10:56.170 --> 10:57.921
Come on. Put it on.

11:00.215 --> 11:01.801
Snap it up.

11:02.010 --> 11:03.386
Jerk the lead.

11:03.595 --> 11:05.430
Didn't you get any sleep?

11:05.638 --> 11:08.601
Are you kidding? I haven't slept
since we got here.

11:10.644 --> 11:13.230
I got the absolute lowdown.

11:13.731 --> 11:16.485
It's on for tonight. For sure.

11:16.693 --> 11:18.028
Yeah.

11:18.487 --> 11:21.615
I got in this crap game
with this guy from F Company.

11:21.823 --> 11:25.661
- He's an orderly for some general.
- Move it. Move it.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.126
Hey, Hutchy!

11:31.335 --> 11:33.420
Hutchy, I want to ask you something.

11:34.213 --> 11:35.839
Hey, Hutchinson...

11:36.091 --> 11:39.761
...do you think they'd let me write
home? If it was really important?

11:39.969 --> 11:43.015
Not likely, mate. Security.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.476
I don't think old Churchill trusts us.

11:45.684 --> 11:48.354
It's the wife, you see.
She's going to have a baby.

11:48.604 --> 11:49.730
Your first, is it?

11:49.940 --> 11:53.193
Oh, it's not mine, but I'm dead
worried about her.

11:53.402 --> 11:55.612
She's not too strong, you see.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.811
Man, that stink.

12:24.562 --> 12:28.483
Diesel oil, backed-up toilets, vomit.

12:29.359 --> 12:31.946
And there ain't no place left
to get sick in.

12:32.780 --> 12:34.490
The puke bags is full.

12:34.699 --> 12:36.993
The fire buckets is full.

12:38.369 --> 12:40.998
All we got left is our helmets.

12:43.375 --> 12:44.835
June.

12:48.089 --> 12:51.718
Every June my old man
used to take me camping...

12:53.888 --> 12:56.474
...up in the Blue Mountains.

12:57.850 --> 13:00.687
We'd hunt and fish all day long.

13:02.481 --> 13:04.191
And at night...

13:05.317 --> 13:08.196
...we'd sleep out under the stars.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.992
Didn't even need a blanket.

13:17.748 --> 13:19.166
June.

13:24.339 --> 13:27.008
Wind and rain. Wind and rain.

13:27.218 --> 13:28.594
Don't it ever stop?

13:28.844 --> 13:31.972
Look, Dad, all I want
to do is get going.

13:32.181 --> 13:36.353
Wind or no wind. Even if we land
in Paris on the Eiffel Tower.

13:36.686 --> 13:39.064
- Come to think of it...
- Colonel wants us.

13:39.272 --> 13:41.025
All of us.

13:54.706 --> 13:58.711
All troops will participate
in ground tactics and deployment.

13:58.962 --> 14:01.047
In this weather, sir?

14:02.216 --> 14:05.719
Of course, Harding, if you can ensure
that we'll land in France...

14:05.928 --> 14:08.556
...in sunshine and dry weather.
- Didn't mean that.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.143
- What did you mean?
- It isn't the weather.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.396
It's the waiting.
These men are itching to go.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.066
I don't think I have to remind you...

14:17.275 --> 14:20.611
...that this war has been going on
for almost five years.

14:20.862 --> 14:23.240
Half of Europe has been
overrun and occupied.

14:23.449 --> 14:25.909
We're comparative newcomers.

14:26.118 --> 14:30.415
England's gone through a blitz with
a knife at her throat since 1940.

14:30.623 --> 14:34.878
I am quite sure that they too
are impatient and itching to go.

14:35.086 --> 14:36.922
Do I make myself clear?

14:37.173 --> 14:38.758
Yes, sir. Quite clear.

14:39.633 --> 14:42.762
Three million men penned up
on this island.

14:42.970 --> 14:46.683
All over England,
in staging areas like this.

14:46.933 --> 14:51.105
We're on the threshold
of the most crucial day of our times.

14:51.314 --> 14:53.524
Three million men out there...

14:53.733 --> 14:58.614
...keyed up, and waiting for
that big step-off.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.160
They aren't exactly alone.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.707
Notify the men. Full packs
and equipment, 14:00 hours.

15:07.957 --> 15:09.083
Yes, sir.

15:15.508 --> 15:17.176
This allows you more freedom.

15:17.384 --> 15:20.555
Quicker to get rid of
when we hit the beach.

15:21.264 --> 15:23.225
- Well?
- It's on.

15:24.142 --> 15:26.229
Tonight, as scheduled.

15:26.813 --> 15:29.232
- If the weather isn't worse.
- How worse can it get?

15:29.440 --> 15:32.653
Ike has called a high-level
conference for 9:30.

15:32.861 --> 15:37.116
I am not Eisenhower. I am
an assistant division commander.

15:37.324 --> 15:42.038
I don't know from nothing,
but he can't call it off again.

15:46.127 --> 15:47.545
Frank, turn that thing off.

15:47.753 --> 15:50.172
Four thousand ships loaded for bear.

15:50.381 --> 15:51.966
Troops ready to go.

15:52.174 --> 15:54.010
Eleven thousand planes on the line.

15:54.219 --> 15:57.848
Eighteen thousand paratroopers.
God only knows how many gliders.

15:58.056 --> 16:00.143
Norm, relax.

16:02.103 --> 16:04.814
RAF says the gale can stop
as suddenly as it began.

16:05.022 --> 16:07.359
So they told us yesterday
and the day before.

16:07.568 --> 16:09.069
Look, Norm.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.322
We're all of us just as...

16:12.573 --> 16:16.077
...dedicated to this thing as you are,
just as anxious to get going.

16:16.286 --> 16:18.288
And that includes Ike.

16:18.496 --> 16:21.459
Now if he calls it off again,
he knows what he's doing.

16:21.667 --> 16:24.378
Of course he does. I know that.

16:24.587 --> 16:28.383
I'm just thinking about those
assault troops. 200,000 of them...

16:28.592 --> 16:31.970
...out there on those ships.
They're probably seasick as hell.

16:32.179 --> 16:35.975
Some of those men have been
on those tubs for almost three days.

16:36.768 --> 16:38.436
I say go.

16:38.686 --> 16:41.272
Go. Weather or no weather.

16:43.317 --> 16:44.526
No!

16:46.111 --> 16:47.988
A hundred on the bone! Let's go.

16:48.197 --> 16:52.160
- Hey, give me $50. I'm busted.
- I'm not doing so good myself.

17:01.378 --> 17:03.089
Hey, lend me $50?

17:08.303 --> 17:10.890
- Lend me 20 bucks?
- Drop dead.

17:16.980 --> 17:18.357
Lend me $ 10?

17:25.698 --> 17:27.242
- Fifty on a bet.
- I got it.

17:27.450 --> 17:29.494
One, two, three, four, five.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.413
Fifty!

17:33.541 --> 17:35.459
Let me hear it, let me hear it.

17:35.668 --> 17:39.131
- Five and two, four and three.
- Six! That's the way we go!

17:39.339 --> 17:42.801
Seven points in a row. It ain't
logical, it just ain't logical.

17:43.009 --> 17:47.932
- There's a hundred out there.
- $ 100 dollars, $20 dollars.

17:48.141 --> 17:49.684
Anything open?

17:49.892 --> 17:51.854
- Forty more.
- Forty more.

17:52.062 --> 17:53.730
You got a bet.

17:54.481 --> 17:58.069
- Okay, you mother-loving...
- Just a minute. Wait a minute.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.613
Here you are. Use this.

18:00.822 --> 18:03.283
- You don't think I'd...
- I don't think anything.

18:03.491 --> 18:06.829
I just like to hear the sound
when it comes out of the cup.

18:08.706 --> 18:10.666
That's it. Shake it.

18:12.002 --> 18:15.547
Okay. Let me see what you do
with it now. Go ahead. Shoot.

18:15.755 --> 18:17.340
- What is it?
- Nothing.

18:18.133 --> 18:19.427
- Seven!
- That's what I wanted!

18:19.677 --> 18:21.929
Who put this cup in the game?

18:22.180 --> 18:24.932
- Next shooter. Who's coming up?
- I'll go $ 100.

18:25.141 --> 18:27.728
He's shooting a hundred.
Who's got it?

18:27.936 --> 18:30.314
- Watch your side bets.
- $ 100.

18:31.940 --> 18:34.652
You got a letter for me.
Schultz, huh?

18:36.654 --> 18:38.031
Yeah, that's it.

18:38.656 --> 18:39.867
Thanks, buddy.

18:48.710 --> 18:52.964
- How much did you take him for?
- Not much. Just a hair over $2500.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.551
- $2500?
- Yeah.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.137
Oh, man, $2500?

18:59.347 --> 19:01.433
It's too bad you had to win it now.

19:01.934 --> 19:03.185
What do you mean, now?

19:03.393 --> 19:06.480
Suppose we take off tonight.
What will you do with it?

19:07.357 --> 19:12.028
Five I take with me to Paris
to blow on the broads and wine.

19:12.237 --> 19:14.698
A thou I leave here for seed
when I get back.

19:14.949 --> 19:17.076
And the rest I send to my mother.

19:39.393 --> 19:42.856
Oh, man, $2500. And in Paris.

19:43.106 --> 19:44.732
You always was lucky.

19:44.941 --> 19:46.860
Hey, remember that night
in Fort Bragg?

19:49.947 --> 19:51.282
I remember it.

19:51.699 --> 19:56.204
You know, I think I sneak over there
and give it a big whang myself.

19:56.454 --> 19:58.373
Why not? What's to lose?

20:02.043 --> 20:03.504
Damn it.

20:05.298 --> 20:08.217
Why did he have to mention Fort Bragg?

20:10.512 --> 20:13.724
I was lucky, all right,
in that crap game.

20:16.101 --> 20:18.646
Next day I break my leg in a jump.

20:19.230 --> 20:21.441
And two months in traction.

20:33.205 --> 20:36.625
$2500.

20:38.794 --> 20:41.839
That's more money I ever had
in my whole life.

20:46.595 --> 20:48.138
I know.

20:49.681 --> 20:52.352
Man, I just know.

21:04.532 --> 21:09.079
I wonder how long it takes
to lose $2500?

21:20.759 --> 21:22.511
Pint of sludge, Ted.

21:30.937 --> 21:33.691
Oh, hello, Dave.
Hey, you seen Johnny?

21:33.899 --> 21:35.151
Yes.

21:35.860 --> 21:37.736
Well, where is he?

21:39.697 --> 21:41.158
Come on, Dave.

21:41.616 --> 21:43.952
I need my boots.
Johnny's borrowed them.

21:45.579 --> 21:47.206
Where is he?

21:47.790 --> 21:49.250
At the bottom...

21:49.458 --> 21:51.085
...of the Channel.

22:00.262 --> 22:01.431
You mean...

22:03.183 --> 22:04.434
...he's bought it?

22:04.642 --> 22:06.936
Ack-ack over Calais.

22:07.145 --> 22:11.192
He jumped clean,
but his parachute didn't open.

22:19.868 --> 22:22.330
That leaves just you
in the squadron, Dave.

22:23.539 --> 22:27.001
I mean, of the old 1940 mob.

22:27.210 --> 22:30.047
What's always worried me
about being one of the few...

22:30.255 --> 22:32.841
...is the way we keep on
getting fewer.

22:34.468 --> 22:35.762
Yeah.

22:36.221 --> 22:37.847
Poor old Johnny.

22:39.641 --> 22:40.850
Bad luck, it happening now.

22:41.059 --> 22:45.481
- Now, then. What's the difference?
- He went through the Battle of Britain!

22:47.274 --> 22:50.070
And now if the big show
starts tonight...

22:50.278 --> 22:52.197
...he won't be in it.

22:53.031 --> 22:55.158
Look, will you please
shut up about him?

22:55.367 --> 22:57.703
All right, all right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22:58.371 --> 23:00.206
You heard something about tonight?

23:00.957 --> 23:03.377
No, no. I haven't heard anything.

23:03.627 --> 23:06.839
- What are you talking about then?
- Well, it's just...

23:07.214 --> 23:10.552
- Go on, go on.
- I have a feeling it's on for tonight.

23:10.802 --> 23:13.221
- That's all.
- A feeling.

23:13.763 --> 23:15.723
Take your feeling somewhere else.

23:17.017 --> 23:18.686
I've got a letter to write.

23:18.894 --> 23:21.564
I've had this feeling since I woke up.

23:22.022 --> 23:23.942
I've had it with me all day long.

23:24.609 --> 23:26.403
I can't shake it off.

23:27.112 --> 23:30.282
It's tonight. I know it is.

23:30.574 --> 23:32.285
All right, it's tonight.

23:32.535 --> 23:33.870
Suits me fine.

23:34.078 --> 23:36.914
Tonight. This afternoon. Now!

23:38.834 --> 23:40.377
I mean...

23:41.920 --> 23:44.256
...as soon as I finish this beer.

23:58.397 --> 24:01.234
- General, can you spare me a minute?
- Come in.

24:01.443 --> 24:03.153
- Thank you.
- Can I get you coffee?

24:03.361 --> 24:05.615
- No, thanks.
- I'll get some for myself.

24:16.752 --> 24:17.920
Is it still raining?

24:18.128 --> 24:19.714
On and off, off and on.

24:19.923 --> 24:22.550
Sometimes I wonder
which side God's on.

24:22.759 --> 24:23.801
What?

24:24.594 --> 24:28.432
I say, sometimes I wonder
which side God's on.

24:28.974 --> 24:30.935
Good question.

24:31.143 --> 24:32.645
What's on your mind, Van?

24:32.853 --> 24:35.941
I'm concerned about the placement
of our drop zones.

24:36.149 --> 24:37.400
Go on.

24:37.609 --> 24:41.197
I know this is a hell of a late date
to bring up something new...

24:41.405 --> 24:43.741
...but you've given me
a tough nut to crack.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.496
- It gets tougher every time I try.
- I know, Van.

24:47.746 --> 24:51.291
Sainte-Mère-Eglise straddles
the only road the Germans can use...

24:51.500 --> 24:55.004
...to drive into our northern flank.
But it has to be taken.

24:55.380 --> 24:57.340
And it has to be held.

24:58.716 --> 25:01.178
That's why I gave you the job, Van.

25:04.849 --> 25:06.976
- Can I use your board?
- Of course.

25:11.857 --> 25:14.986
Here's the town. Heavily fortified.

25:15.194 --> 25:18.614
Down here is the swamp area
that the Germans have flooded.

25:18.823 --> 25:22.786
And in between, four miles
from the town, is our drop zone.

25:22.995 --> 25:25.414
Now if anything goes wrong
and we undershoot...

25:25.622 --> 25:28.500
...we land in this flooded area
and are bogged down.

25:28.709 --> 25:31.963
If we overshoot, we come down
like clay pigeons...

25:32.172 --> 25:35.133
...smack dab in the center
of Sainte-Mère-Eglise.

25:35.341 --> 25:39.889
That's why I gave the men training
in low-level jumps near the villages.

25:40.097 --> 25:41.682
So I've heard.

25:43.977 --> 25:47.606
Got a complaint from
the city council at Bexhall.

25:47.814 --> 25:52.445
Some of your men overshot
the drop zone and landed in the town.

25:52.653 --> 25:56.490
- Tied up traffic for an hour.
- That's true, sir. I was with them.

25:56.742 --> 25:59.578
Sudden crosswind hit us,
swept us over the treetops...

25:59.786 --> 26:01.872
...scattered us all over the place.

26:03.541 --> 26:08.463
- Where did you end up?
- In the courtyard of a convent.

26:09.464 --> 26:11.467
Relax, Van. Sit down.

26:12.843 --> 26:16.805
The last few months have been
a tough grind on all of us.

26:17.432 --> 26:20.685
I hear you've been working yourself
and your battalion hard.

26:20.894 --> 26:22.938
Almost without a stop.

26:24.524 --> 26:27.193
Now that we're almost
at the end of the line...

26:27.401 --> 26:30.696
...why don't you try easing up
on yourself and on the men?

26:31.197 --> 26:34.743
Sometimes a battalion can be
sharpened to too fine a point.

26:35.118 --> 26:38.038
Sometimes a commander can too.

26:40.458 --> 26:41.626
Well...

26:42.961 --> 26:46.507
...if there's any further delay...

26:46.715 --> 26:50.469
...I request permission to submit
a new placement for our drop zones.

26:50.719 --> 26:52.847
All right. Put it in writing.

26:53.056 --> 26:55.433
Make it official.
That's your prerogative.

26:56.184 --> 27:01.148
But Ike has called a final meeting
for tonight at Southwick House.

27:01.607 --> 27:04.277
If it's on, we'll get
the green light by 9:30.

27:04.485 --> 27:07.281
- What are the chances?
- Better than 50-50.

27:07.656 --> 27:11.743
Forget everything I said. I got
the best battalion in this division...

27:11.952 --> 27:12.954
...and they're ready.

27:28.722 --> 27:30.974
Here it is. The latest report.

27:49.704 --> 27:52.582
- It's Southwick House, sir.
- Stagg here.

27:52.999 --> 27:56.629
Yes, sir. The new front's moving in
much faster than we thought.

27:57.588 --> 27:59.965
Yes, sir, it's definitely improving.

28:01.467 --> 28:03.762
I'll be there, sir. 9:30.

28:10.269 --> 28:14.023
- Would you like some more tea, sir?
- Coffee, and make it black.

28:14.232 --> 28:15.233
Please.

28:15.651 --> 28:17.528
One moment, Colonel Priller.

28:18.278 --> 28:20.405
Why wasn't he court-martialed?

28:20.614 --> 28:22.575
He shot down 132 planes.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.542
Don't call me "Pips, old boy."

28:29.792 --> 28:33.212
You were a rotten pilot
when we flew in Russia.

28:33.420 --> 28:36.967
You're flying a desk now, but
you're still a rotten pilot!

28:37.926 --> 28:40.262
What's that you're saying?

28:40.470 --> 28:44.767
I'm squatting here on this
God-forsaken airfield...

28:44.976 --> 28:49.480
...with only two planes...
two stinking crates!

28:51.149 --> 28:54.486
Oh, sure, sure... your
orders were followed!

28:54.695 --> 28:56.989
Now my squadrons are God-knows-where!

28:57.490 --> 29:02.620
My supplies are all gone. What
am I supposed to do now?

29:02.829 --> 29:08.043
But Pips, we had to disperse our
fighter squadrons... we had to!

29:08.252 --> 29:12.591
Look what happened to our airstrips
around the Pas-de-Calais!

29:12.799 --> 29:15.635
The whole idea is absolutely idiotic!

29:16.052 --> 29:20.057
You move us back instead of forward!

29:20.266 --> 29:25.188
Sure, I know the weather's lousy
and they probably won't invade...

29:25.397 --> 29:28.525
...but what would happen if they did?

29:28.775 --> 29:32.906
But you know I can't get there
with my equipment for two days.

29:33.114 --> 29:36.784
I tell you, you're all crazy!

29:54.889 --> 29:57.433
Priller has always been a hothead...

29:57.642 --> 30:00.395
...but let's not underestimate him.

30:01.313 --> 30:04.149
What he says is not entirely illogical.

30:05.192 --> 30:06.903
What's the weather report?

30:07.111 --> 30:09.447
Slightly better over the Channel.

30:10.365 --> 30:12.617
I wouldn't be surprised if...

30:14.370 --> 30:18.207
- When's the next weather report?
- Tonight at 8, General.

30:19.166 --> 30:21.711
Keep me posted on the weather.

30:22.712 --> 30:24.839
You made my dinner reservations?

30:25.048 --> 30:26.841
Yes, I did, General.

30:27.050 --> 30:28.719
Cancel everything.

30:42.944 --> 30:48.534
Shoes for my wife, I had them
specially made in Paris...

30:48.826 --> 30:53.664
...for her birthday... tomorrow,
the sixth of June.

30:53.872 --> 30:56.293
Please wish her a happy birthday.

30:56.501 --> 30:57.961
Thank you, Speidel.

31:01.089 --> 31:04.552
Why didn't they attack in May?
The weather was perfect...

31:08.472 --> 31:10.642
An attack now would be embarrassing.

31:12.060 --> 31:15.147
But I don't think we need worry.

31:37.548 --> 31:39.133
Is the plan ready, sir?

31:39.592 --> 31:42.970
Yes, yes, quite finished.

31:44.598 --> 31:46.141
War games...

31:47.684 --> 31:50.020
...theoretical invasions.

31:51.064 --> 31:57.028
Rush to Rennes just to push
little flags around a table.

31:59.949 --> 32:01.951
Playing at war!

32:04.119 --> 32:06.373
Do you win or lose, sir?

32:07.707 --> 32:09.209
Have I ever lost?

32:13.005 --> 32:17.969
But General, this time you play
the role of Eisenhower.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.974
I win because I go against the rules.

32:23.100 --> 32:26.771
We expect them to cross at the
narrowest part of the Channel...

32:26.980 --> 32:31.859
...and in good weather. But that's
too simple... too obvious.

32:32.068 --> 32:37.199
I choose the widest part, in the
worst weather... and attack here.

32:38.284 --> 32:39.744
In Normandy.

32:40.161 --> 32:41.830
And in bad weather!

32:46.127 --> 32:47.378
Like now...

32:48.170 --> 32:49.463
...bad weather!

32:49.839 --> 32:53.009
Trying to pick a trend is difficult.

32:53.760 --> 32:58.432
From a meteorological standpoint,
conditions almost resemble mid-winter.

32:58.640 --> 32:59.850
And Normandy?

33:00.059 --> 33:03.646
High winds, clouds,
and some fog over the beaches.

33:03.855 --> 33:07.985
However, I can say with a certain
degree of safety...

33:08.235 --> 33:11.488
...that we can expect a brief period
of fair conditions.

33:11.697 --> 33:13.699
Let me summarize, then.

33:14.200 --> 33:19.080
What you're promising us is a barely
tolerable period of fair conditions.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.415
Am I right?

33:20.624 --> 33:21.751
Yes.

33:21.959 --> 33:25.588
Conditions that are far below
the minimum requirements.

33:25.796 --> 33:28.216
That's all I can promise.

33:28.425 --> 33:31.845
You've done your best, Stagg.
Thank you, gentlemen.

33:36.768 --> 33:37.769
Well...

33:38.102 --> 33:39.604
...there it is.

33:40.396 --> 33:43.400
We've postponed the attack
once already.

33:43.984 --> 33:48.072
Now, either we go on the 6th,
with only marginal conditions...

33:49.074 --> 33:50.825
...or postpone again...

33:51.284 --> 33:53.787
...in the hope of getting
perfect conditions.

33:53.995 --> 33:55.665
What do you think, Monty?

33:55.873 --> 33:57.959
I say, go. Go.

33:58.167 --> 34:00.461
I must remind everybody...

34:00.670 --> 34:04.591
...that the American convoy
for the Omaha and Utah beaches...

34:04.800 --> 34:06.677
...they've farthest to go...

34:06.885 --> 34:10.181
...must be given the order
within the next half-hour...

34:10.389 --> 34:13.559
...if the assault is to take place
on the 6th.

34:17.147 --> 34:20.734
We can't keep almost a quarter
of a million men on ships...

34:20.943 --> 34:23.947
...in embarkation areas, indefinitely.

34:24.656 --> 34:28.243
The longer we wait, the more
acute our security problem.

34:28.577 --> 34:30.204
The next time...

34:30.413 --> 34:32.956
...the tides and the moon
will be right...

34:36.210 --> 34:37.795
Not before July.

34:41.550 --> 34:42.759
Gentlemen...

34:44.804 --> 34:46.723
...such a postponement...

34:48.516 --> 34:51.145
...is too bitter to contemplate.

34:53.438 --> 34:58.069
A brilliant plan, General.
Unorthodox, but brilliant.

35:00.488 --> 35:03.241
Fortunately, it's only a game.

35:04.576 --> 35:07.663
I don't think we have
much to worry about.

35:08.539 --> 35:12.669
Eisenhower would never
take the gamble.

35:13.462 --> 35:14.838
Never.

35:19.302 --> 35:23.014
I'm quite positive
we must give the order.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.976
I don't like it...

35:26.393 --> 35:28.062
...but there it is.

35:28.604 --> 35:29.855
Gentlemen...

35:30.689 --> 35:34.819
...I don't see how we can possibly
do anything else but go.

35:51.755 --> 35:53.340
Wilson speaking.

35:54.008 --> 35:55.426
Yes, sir.

35:59.055 --> 36:02.893
It's on, sir. Ike's made the
decision. Tonight, as scheduled!

36:17.702 --> 36:19.578
Colonel Tomson speaking.

36:23.625 --> 36:24.710
Thank you.

36:29.757 --> 36:31.092
Next stop...

36:31.342 --> 36:32.844
...Normandy.

36:34.262 --> 36:36.849
God help us now.

36:54.493 --> 36:55.745
Gentlemen...

36:55.954 --> 36:58.373
...the day we've been
waiting for has arrived.

36:58.874 --> 37:01.501
Invasion! We're on our way.

37:08.134 --> 37:09.177
General.

37:11.180 --> 37:13.974
The orders have been given.
It's on.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.272
Have the battalion commanders
join me in the wardroom.

37:30.326 --> 37:31.828
All right, Sergeant.

37:34.122 --> 37:36.917
You men are the eyes
of our airborne army.

37:37.501 --> 37:42.090
You, the pathfinders, will have
one job, and one job only:

37:43.174 --> 37:46.053
To light the drop zones
for our paratroops.

37:46.720 --> 37:50.015
Along with the British and Canadians
you'll be the first men...

37:50.224 --> 37:53.061
...to land in France.
And remember this:

37:53.269 --> 37:55.063
When you get to Normandy...

37:55.522 --> 37:57.691
...you'll only have one friend:

37:58.442 --> 37:59.610
God.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.573
And this.

38:07.119 --> 38:08.120
This...

38:10.122 --> 38:11.581
...is Rupert.

38:13.042 --> 38:15.378
Now, we are going to drop Rupert...

38:15.586 --> 38:17.422
...and a lot more like him...

38:17.630 --> 38:19.717
...behind the invasion area.

38:22.261 --> 38:23.345
He's...

38:23.971 --> 38:26.558
...a very extraordinary
fellow, Rupert.

38:27.767 --> 38:29.436
He's sort of a...

38:29.644 --> 38:32.105
...one-man army, all by himself.

38:33.064 --> 38:34.400
Let me show you.

38:36.277 --> 38:38.696
Let me show you what happens
when Rupert...

38:38.946 --> 38:40.449
...hits the ground.

38:40.866 --> 38:42.701
Sergeant, switch off
the lights, please.

38:50.918 --> 38:52.503
All right, Sergeant, that's all.

38:53.296 --> 38:55.215
All right, come on. Simmer down.

38:55.466 --> 38:56.634
Come on, up.

39:01.097 --> 39:06.102
It's possible that Rupert and his men
will do the same thing to the Germans.

39:06.311 --> 39:09.273
Confuse them, make them look
over their shoulders...

39:09.482 --> 39:12.068
...and launch an attack
in the wrong direction.

39:21.788 --> 39:23.164
Ten-hut!

39:24.832 --> 39:27.710
- The crickets have been distributed.
- So I heard.

39:29.755 --> 39:31.048
At ease!

39:33.467 --> 39:36.304
You're as ready as we can make you.

39:37.722 --> 39:39.891
This five-cent toy...

39:40.392 --> 39:42.937
...wasn't issued to you for laughs.

39:43.145 --> 39:45.106
It may save your life.

39:45.606 --> 39:47.900
You're gonna be landing in the dark.

39:48.776 --> 39:51.238
On the other side of that hedgerow...

39:51.446 --> 39:55.993
...the fellow may not be wearing
the same uniform you are. So...

39:56.201 --> 39:57.829
...one click...

39:58.079 --> 40:00.665
...is to be answered by two clicks.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.254
And if you don't
get that answering click...

40:05.713 --> 40:07.840
...hit the dirt and open fire.

40:08.048 --> 40:09.091
I repeat:

40:09.800 --> 40:11.136
One click...

40:11.344 --> 40:13.596
...must be answered by two clicks.

40:14.764 --> 40:18.561
Now, hang on to this gimmick.
It's as important as your weapon.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.521
Do you read me?

40:20.730 --> 40:22.690
Loud and clear, sir.

40:22.898 --> 40:25.152
All right. One more thing.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.988
Your assignment tonight is strategic.

40:28.613 --> 40:31.159
You can't give the enemy a break.

40:32.368 --> 40:34.245
Send them to hell.

40:39.752 --> 40:41.420
That is all.

40:49.471 --> 40:53.225
<i>London calling with messages</i>
<i>for our friends.</i>

40:59.232 --> 41:03.153
<i>"Molasses tomorrow will</i>
<i>bring forth cognac. "</i>

41:07.909 --> 41:10.703
<i>"John has a long mustache."</i>

41:10.912 --> 41:11.996
<i>I repeat:</i>

41:12.246 --> 41:15.125
<i>"John has a long mustache."</i>

41:16.627 --> 41:18.796
"John has a long mustache!"

41:34.356 --> 41:36.358
No, not yet...

41:36.608 --> 41:37.985
Oh, my Lord!

42:00.510 --> 42:02.805
"John has a long mustache."

42:33.715 --> 42:35.675
Make any sense to you, mac?

42:36.093 --> 42:40.348
As I said last night, they're code
messages to the Resistance chaps.

42:40.598 --> 42:43.518
Obviously, one message means
something to one group...

42:43.727 --> 42:46.063
...and another means something
to another group.

42:46.980 --> 42:52.320
<i>"There is a fire at the travel agency."</i>

42:52.612 --> 42:54.405
<i>I repeat:</i>

42:56.950 --> 43:01.538
<i>"There is a fire at the travel agency."</i>

43:02.873 --> 43:06.336
<i>"Wounds my heart with a</i>
<i>monotonous languor. "</i>

43:06.544 --> 43:07.712
<i>I repeat:</i>

43:07.921 --> 43:12.051
<i>"Wounds my heart with a</i>
<i>monotonous languor. "</i>

43:25.066 --> 43:27.568
The bridge... in forty-five minutes.

43:36.453 --> 43:38.832
We'll be back.

43:47.216 --> 43:50.803
<i>"Wounds my heart with a</i>
<i>monotonous languor. "</i>

43:51.512 --> 43:52.889
<i>I repeat:</i>

43:53.098 --> 43:56.935
<i>"Wounds my heart with a</i>
<i>monotonous languor. "</i>

43:59.605 --> 44:02.483
<i>"There is a fire at the travel agency."</i>

44:13.955 --> 44:16.541
The best hand I've had all night.

44:16.791 --> 44:19.002
Let me see here...

44:23.174 --> 44:24.508
Pardon me.

44:25.217 --> 44:28.764
Pardon me, General... it's come!

44:28.972 --> 44:31.350
Wait. Give that to me.

44:31.892 --> 44:33.101
What's come?

44:33.352 --> 44:35.104
It's the second part of the message.

44:36.064 --> 44:37.774
The second verse.

44:37.982 --> 44:40.693
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

44:42.071 --> 44:44.698
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

44:47.242 --> 44:50.080
We can expect the invasion
within 24 hours!

44:51.915 --> 44:54.250
Put the Fifteenth Army on full alert.

44:56.712 --> 44:58.089
Thank you.

45:05.681 --> 45:10.937
You know, I'm too old a bunny to
get very excited about all this.

45:11.145 --> 45:15.693
Now... where was I...?
Oh yes, two spades!

45:43.265 --> 45:45.226
It's almost impossible to believe.

45:46.185 --> 45:48.354
Every dot represents a ship.

45:49.022 --> 45:52.609
You got battlewagons, cruisers,
destroyers, minesweepers.

45:52.818 --> 45:55.988
You got assault craft of every size
and every type.

45:58.116 --> 46:00.785
The biggest armada
the world's ever known.

46:05.875 --> 46:07.251
Here.

46:10.254 --> 46:11.965
You remember it.

46:12.799 --> 46:14.509
Remember every bit of it.

46:15.093 --> 46:16.720
We're on the eve of a day...

46:16.928 --> 46:20.683
...that people will talk about
long after we're dead and gone.

46:32.364 --> 46:33.990
You wanna know something?

46:34.866 --> 46:37.869
It gives me goose pimples
just to be part of it.

46:49.424 --> 46:51.343
You could call it one of them...

46:51.551 --> 46:54.597
...crazy, quickie wartime marriages,
you know?

46:54.806 --> 46:58.017
Met at a dance at the USO
and all that...

46:58.309 --> 47:00.270
...but, I mean, I took it serious.

47:00.521 --> 47:03.732
And so did she.
We didn't do it just for kicks.

47:04.024 --> 47:06.778
- When did you get the letter?
- Week ago.

47:06.986 --> 47:08.113
Two weeks.

47:09.864 --> 47:13.034
Maybe I was wrong, what I wrote her.

47:14.161 --> 47:17.123
I mean, she's a high-class model
and all, and I...

47:19.500 --> 47:22.963
I'm not the kind of guy
to get married that easy.

47:23.171 --> 47:25.257
I mean, it wasn't no joke to me.

47:30.346 --> 47:35.102
But oh, man, we really had some
wonderful times together.

47:36.228 --> 47:38.981
And you think she's got a boyfriend?

47:40.941 --> 47:43.903
Well, she never actually said so...

47:44.529 --> 47:45.864
I mean...

47:47.741 --> 47:50.953
You think I was right?
I mean, was I fair?

47:52.705 --> 47:55.166
She can't get one
without your permission, right?

47:55.375 --> 47:57.210
You gotta give your okay.

47:57.544 --> 47:59.046
I know it's the law.

47:59.254 --> 48:02.090
They passed it for all the Dear Johns.

48:08.931 --> 48:12.811
Well, I guess I better be
getting back to the outfit.

48:16.274 --> 48:17.776
Good luck.

48:19.235 --> 48:20.820
You too.

48:31.833 --> 48:35.045
Who was that guy?
The one you was talking to so long?

48:37.215 --> 48:39.092
I don't know, Sparrow.

48:40.009 --> 48:42.637
I never saw him before in my life.

49:04.495 --> 49:09.710
Happy birthday, General...
from your staff!

49:14.215 --> 49:15.466
Thank you.

49:18.302 --> 49:19.972
Will you cut the cake, sir?

49:21.098 --> 49:24.143
I trust you don't
expect me to eat it, too!

49:51.090 --> 49:52.258
What's that?

49:52.925 --> 49:57.181
<i>Dummkopf,</i> that's the "V for
victory" sign. Three dots and a dash.

49:59.683 --> 50:02.437
Ain't you never heard
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony?

50:40.480 --> 50:42.900
Release point coming up, Major Howard.

50:43.234 --> 50:45.361
Right, prepare for landing.

50:45.569 --> 50:47.071
Cutting loose now.

50:47.279 --> 50:48.322
Roger and out.

51:15.395 --> 51:18.566
<i>Major Howard, I cannot overestimate</i>
<i>the importance of your task.</i>

51:18.774 --> 51:23.028
<i>The Orne River Bridge must be captured</i>
<i>before the enemy can destroy it.</i>

51:23.279 --> 51:28.118
<i>It's a vital military artery, and the</i>
<i>enemy has prepared it for demolition.</i>

51:28.618 --> 51:32.707
<i>It must be taken by surprise</i>
<i>and captured intact.</i>

51:33.249 --> 51:37.336
<i>Your gliders will land at night,</i>
<i>without the benefit of ground support.</i>

51:37.546 --> 51:40.257
<i>You will assault the garrison,</i>
<i>overwhelm it...</i>

51:40.466 --> 51:42.634
<i>... and hold until relieved.</i>

51:43.135 --> 51:45.263
<i>Hold until relieved.</i>

51:45.472 --> 51:46.681
Major Howard!

51:46.890 --> 51:48.600
There's the bridge coming up.

51:50.018 --> 51:51.771
Just on our left.

52:01.782 --> 52:03.492
Right, link your arms.

52:04.117 --> 52:05.328
Brace yourselves.

52:28.354 --> 52:29.522
Feet up!

52:31.482 --> 52:32.691
Hang on!

53:38.392 --> 53:39.518
Smoke screen. Smoke.

53:43.106 --> 53:46.234
Up the action, bucks!
Up the action, bucks!

53:56.497 --> 53:58.749
Right, Tom.
Over the bridge.

54:24.237 --> 54:26.155
Check for demolition charges!

55:03.698 --> 55:05.576
Hello! Hello!

55:27.517 --> 55:28.560
Clear.

55:44.119 --> 55:45.871
It's working!

55:52.837 --> 55:53.630
Where's the doc?

55:53.838 --> 55:56.258
On the third glider.
There's no report from them.

55:56.842 --> 55:57.718
Walsh.

55:57.927 --> 55:58.928
Sir?

55:59.136 --> 56:01.807
Tom, Ruskin and Royal have had it.
Take over.

56:02.015 --> 56:03.850
On the other end of the bridge.

56:04.059 --> 56:06.436
- What happened to you?
- Broke it on landing.

56:06.645 --> 56:08.981
- Isn't the doc with you?
- No, he's missing.

56:09.190 --> 56:12.610
We crashed in the river.
Afraid we've got a lot of casualties.

56:13.277 --> 56:15.239
I'm all right, sir.
So are the boys.

56:15.447 --> 56:18.784
- Okay, carry on.
- Right, sir. Come on!

56:41.935 --> 56:43.563
Well, I'll be...

56:44.147 --> 56:45.690
Hey, doc! Doc!

56:46.816 --> 56:49.068
What are you doing there?
That's the German side.

56:49.277 --> 56:52.239
Sir, anybody can make a mistake.

57:03.042 --> 57:04.128
Sir?

57:04.336 --> 57:07.548
The demolition charges have
been removed. It's all clear.

57:07.756 --> 57:09.550
Good. Corporal Smith.

57:11.303 --> 57:15.140
Send out the success code words.
Keep sending until acknowledged.

57:16.516 --> 57:20.229
- John, set up HQ in that pillbox.
- Right, sir.

57:24.860 --> 57:27.404
All in less than 15 minutes.

57:30.866 --> 57:32.911
Only a matter of time before
they counterattack.

57:33.119 --> 57:37.290
- What about the paratroopers?
- 7th Para might not get here for hours.

57:37.665 --> 57:39.752
And Lovat and his commandos...

57:40.628 --> 57:43.047
It could be midday
before they get here.

57:44.381 --> 57:46.802
The question is,
how long can we hold?

57:47.677 --> 57:49.387
<i>Hold until relieved.</i>

57:50.430 --> 57:52.266
<i>Hold until relieved.</i>

58:02.986 --> 58:04.822
It's raining again.

58:05.030 --> 58:06.241
Thank you.

58:06.866 --> 58:08.535
Did you get the list?

58:12.747 --> 58:17.628
Gen. Schlieben of the 709th has
already left for the war games.

58:18.295 --> 58:24.136
The Commander of the 243rd
left for Rennes at 18:00 hours.

58:25.011 --> 58:28.850
Also, Zimmermann of the 352nd...
twelve officers in all.

58:29.976 --> 58:31.978
Yes, I know.

58:32.770 --> 58:37.067
The weather is bad, so everyone
enjoys an extra night in Rennes.

58:38.318 --> 58:39.903
I don't like it.

58:40.154 --> 58:41.489
Any of it.

58:41.698 --> 58:44.909
So many key officers are
away at the same time.

58:45.118 --> 58:47.287
I don't know why, but I don't like it.

58:48.289 --> 58:51.625
But the war games have been
scheduled for a week...

58:51.834 --> 58:55.630
Yes, for tomorrow... not tonight.

58:58.008 --> 59:01.679
Advise all officers who have
not yet left for Rennes...

59:01.888 --> 59:04.891
...to postpone their
departure until tomorrow.

59:05.099 --> 59:07.935
May I remind you, General...

59:08.144 --> 59:11.899
...that the Allies have always landed
in perfect weather conditions.

59:12.107 --> 59:16.196
North Africa... Sicily... Italy...

59:16.946 --> 59:18.448
Yes, and always at dawn!

59:27.082 --> 59:29.878
We're 11 minutes from the green light.

59:30.086 --> 59:32.297
Now, once more, I repeat:

59:32.839 --> 59:36.302
If, for any reason, we fail
to hit our drop zones...

59:36.552 --> 59:38.387
...move north by east.

59:38.763 --> 59:40.515
North by east.

59:41.015 --> 59:44.561
The Germans have flooded large
swamp areas behind the coast.

59:44.812 --> 59:46.980
Avoid them if possible.

59:47.189 --> 59:50.067
We came here to fight, not to swim.

59:50.485 --> 59:51.861
Do you read me?

59:52.111 --> 59:53.404
Loud and clear, sir.

01:00:15.138 --> 01:00:16.764
How'd you make out?

01:00:17.807 --> 01:00:19.685
How did you make out at the game?

01:00:21.603 --> 01:00:22.604
I lost.

01:00:26.067 --> 01:00:28.403
Now we're both jumping clean.

01:00:46.007 --> 01:00:49.844
I understand. And when will
the Field Marshal return?

01:00:51.804 --> 01:00:53.599
I see. Oh, well.

01:00:53.807 --> 01:00:55.225
Just a moment.

01:00:56.977 --> 01:00:58.604
The radar report.

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:05.612
We are getting reports of
strong radar interference...

01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:08.449
...and radio reception is jammed.

01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:14.956
I realize this has happened before,
but never this effectively!

01:01:15.123 --> 01:01:16.124
And the...

01:01:17.626 --> 01:01:20.463
Call the OB West? Very well.

01:01:21.005 --> 01:01:24.592
Give my respects to the Field
Marshal when he returns.

01:01:57.713 --> 01:01:58.714
Bye, Rupert.

01:01:58.923 --> 01:02:02.177
Do your duty for God, king,
and your country.

01:03:06.083 --> 01:03:09.253
Call for reinforcements!
We're under attack!

01:04:32.473 --> 01:04:34.475
- Are we late?
- No, but...

01:04:34.685 --> 01:04:36.228
...we must hurry!

01:05:48.143 --> 01:05:49.353
What is it?

01:05:56.695 --> 01:05:58.239
I'll go.

01:06:18.011 --> 01:06:19.096
Stop!

01:06:20.306 --> 01:06:21.473
We said, stop!

01:06:21.891 --> 01:06:23.893
Stop, or I'll shoot!

01:06:28.773 --> 01:06:30.025
What are you doing here?

01:06:30.817 --> 01:06:32.945
I live in that farm.

01:06:33.571 --> 01:06:36.532
Nobody lives in that farm.

01:06:37.783 --> 01:06:40.495
- It's abandoned.
- Show me your papers.

01:06:42.039 --> 01:06:43.498
Hurry up!

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.340
Come with me.

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:52.008
Go on!

01:07:31.637 --> 01:07:33.639
Put your bicycle there.

01:07:34.557 --> 01:07:35.767
Hans!

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:38.728
Hans, where are you?

01:07:40.063 --> 01:07:43.234
- What's going on here?
- Nothing!

01:07:43.818 --> 01:07:46.237
Who is with you? I want to know!

01:07:55.581 --> 01:07:56.875
Stop!

01:07:57.333 --> 01:07:58.626
Stop!

01:08:11.391 --> 01:08:12.767
Stop!

01:08:17.564 --> 01:08:18.566
Stop!

01:08:18.774 --> 01:08:20.484
Stop!

01:09:08.997 --> 01:09:11.334
Good luck at the war games, General.

01:09:14.087 --> 01:09:15.839
Anything important?

01:09:16.048 --> 01:09:19.928
Communications reports difficulty
in contacting our forward posts.

01:09:21.263 --> 01:09:23.223
The Underground again!

01:09:23.974 --> 01:09:28.520
Some sort of rubber dummies have
been dropped by parachute.

01:09:29.104 --> 01:09:30.564
Rubber dummies!

01:09:32.441 --> 01:09:34.361
Connect me with General Richter!

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:39.616
We can expect commando raids
and other diversionary tactics...

01:09:41.578 --> 01:09:45.122
...but I don't like this idea
of dummy parachutists.

01:09:51.714 --> 01:09:52.881
Are you certain?

01:09:54.259 --> 01:09:55.385
How many?

01:09:56.928 --> 01:09:58.555
What do you think of it?

01:10:03.227 --> 01:10:04.729
Paratroopers...

01:10:11.153 --> 01:10:12.571
Put it over there.

01:10:19.537 --> 01:10:23.334
This is what they dropped, they
explode on contact with the earth.

01:10:23.542 --> 01:10:26.086
In the dark, they look like soldiers.

01:10:26.337 --> 01:10:31.551
Perhaps these are what General
Richter saw, not real paratroopers.

01:10:40.561 --> 01:10:45.776
When you create a diversion,
it's for a reason.

01:10:45.984 --> 01:10:48.779
Connect me with General Pemsel!

01:10:53.159 --> 01:10:54.327
Dummies...?!

01:10:54.827 --> 01:10:56.455
Rubber dummies!

01:10:58.374 --> 01:11:03.337
I agree with you, General.
I'll call you back.

01:11:05.632 --> 01:11:07.551
What about my call to von Rundstedt?

01:11:07.759 --> 01:11:11.222
We haven't been able to reach him.
The main lines seem to be cut.

01:11:15.142 --> 01:11:17.144
They wouldn't drop dummies...

01:11:17.354 --> 01:11:20.107
...unless it was to divert our
attention from something else.

01:11:20.315 --> 01:11:21.817
In this weather?

01:11:22.025 --> 01:11:23.610
In any kind of weather!

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:26.823
I must get in touch with OB West.

01:12:20.885 --> 01:12:24.013
They're enemy paratroopers!

01:12:38.238 --> 01:12:40.156
Blimey, mate...

01:12:40.365 --> 01:12:43.452
...you'll wake up the whole blooming
German Army!

01:13:20.369 --> 01:13:21.704
Fellas!

01:13:21.912 --> 01:13:23.665
I'm hung up!

01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:25.417
Fellas!

01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:39.266
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:19.463
Where have you come from?

01:15:21.633 --> 01:15:23.343
Awfully sorry, old man.

01:15:23.594 --> 01:15:25.762
Simply landed here by accident.

01:15:32.312 --> 01:15:33.813
What's that?

01:15:34.648 --> 01:15:37.651
Sorry I startled you.
I'm trying to find my communion set.

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:38.819
Your what?

01:15:39.028 --> 01:15:41.281
My communion set. I've lost it.

01:15:41.573 --> 01:15:44.409
Now listen, padre.
We've got no time to look for...

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.377
I'm sure that it was here
that I lost it.

01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:16.655
We're under fire, padre.
Don't you think we ought to...

01:16:16.863 --> 01:16:20.533
You go on, my boy. Go on.
I'm sure I shall only be a minute.

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:24.872
Cor! Stuff a grouse.

01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:31.171
I've got it! I've got it!

01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:33.173
Glory be.

01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:37.220
Now, my son, let's go
about God's work this night.

01:16:49.441 --> 01:16:50.443
Pluskat.

01:16:54.698 --> 01:16:56.992
Hello, Pluskat! Do you hear me?

01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:02.290
Nothing that I've heard...

01:17:04.543 --> 01:17:08.255
The usual bombing, but quite distant.

01:17:10.382 --> 01:17:12.677
Oh, yes, I can hear it.

01:17:14.178 --> 01:17:15.680
Well, wait a minute.

01:17:15.888 --> 01:17:17.765
Yes, just a moment.

01:17:31.615 --> 01:17:35.911
Flares... but a long way up the coast.

01:17:36.454 --> 01:17:39.499
Yes, Cherbourg is getting hit again.

01:17:39.958 --> 01:17:42.544
There's probably nothing to it...

01:17:43.337 --> 01:17:47.842
...but we have had reports
of paratrooper landings.

01:17:48.051 --> 01:17:51.054
I'll go to my bunker and take a look.

01:17:51.638 --> 01:17:53.515
Thank you, sir.

01:18:11.869 --> 01:18:14.081
Higher! Higher!

01:18:19.252 --> 01:18:22.256
Louis, open your store.
We need more buckets!

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:30.140
Mayor Renaud, you must
come with me immediately.

01:18:30.349 --> 01:18:33.769
- Is it important?
- Very important, Mayor Renaud.

01:18:43.864 --> 01:18:45.408
What's wrong, madam?

01:18:45.616 --> 01:18:48.620
I was on my way to the
little house outside...

01:18:49.079 --> 01:18:51.957
Suddenly, I saw a man
fall from the sky.

01:18:52.207 --> 01:18:54.251
- A parachutist?
- Yes, that's right.

01:18:54.459 --> 01:18:55.920
He looked like a big white bird!

01:18:56.129 --> 01:18:58.256
- British or German?
- What?

01:18:58.506 --> 01:19:00.842
The parachutist... was he
a friend or an enemy?

01:19:01.092 --> 01:19:04.722
I don't know. He disappeared
without a word. Just "Shh!"

01:19:05.055 --> 01:19:07.266
- Without a word?
- Just "Shh!"

01:19:15.483 --> 01:19:17.153
<i>Bonjour, madame...</i>

01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:19.488
<i>... je suis amêricain.</i>

01:19:20.031 --> 01:19:21.991
<i>Bonjour, mademoiselle...</i>

01:19:22.575 --> 01:19:23.994
<i>... je suis amêricain.</i>

01:19:26.288 --> 01:19:28.206
We seem to be circling.

01:19:28.957 --> 01:19:32.211
Maybe they're having difficulty
finding the drop zone.

01:19:33.338 --> 01:19:34.714
<i>Je suis...</i>

01:19:34.964 --> 01:19:36.341
<i>... amêricain.</i>

01:19:36.549 --> 01:19:39.136
<i>Je suis amêricain.</i>

01:19:40.596 --> 01:19:41.764
<i>Voulez-vous...</i>

01:19:42.222 --> 01:19:43.223
<i>... mademoiselle?</i>

01:19:44.934 --> 01:19:45.935
Okay.

01:19:47.145 --> 01:19:48.480
Go!

01:19:49.356 --> 01:19:50.649
Go!

01:20:23.687 --> 01:20:25.355
Paratroopers!

01:23:47.128 --> 01:23:48.380
Anything new?

01:23:48.588 --> 01:23:52.592
Heavy bombing over
Cherbourg as usual, sir...

01:23:53.009 --> 01:23:55.262
...and now near Caen.

01:23:55.471 --> 01:23:58.182
The lines to Stations 6
and 8 have been cut...

01:23:58.391 --> 01:24:00.518
...but the direct line is open.

01:24:18.831 --> 01:24:20.749
I'll stay for a while.

01:24:22.252 --> 01:24:25.505
- Would you like coffee?
- Yes, thank you.

01:25:07.094 --> 01:25:09.722
For God's sakes, padre,
stop that damn noise.

01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:12.559
I'm sorry, son. I'm afraid I'm lost.

01:25:12.809 --> 01:25:14.436
Well, who ain't? Now, come on.

01:26:08.957 --> 01:26:10.041
Two clicks.

01:26:10.291 --> 01:26:12.419
I heard two clicks.

01:27:53.576 --> 01:27:54.744
Man...

01:27:54.953 --> 01:27:56.872
...am I glad to see you.

01:27:57.665 --> 01:28:00.710
- You guys the 82nd?
- No. This is the 101.

01:28:00.918 --> 01:28:02.253
101?

01:28:02.461 --> 01:28:03.755
Where's the 82nd?

01:28:03.964 --> 01:28:07.300
Look, bud, we don't even know
where our own outfit is.

01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:11.055
Well, somebody's shooting at somebody.

01:28:11.264 --> 01:28:12.765
Let's us go find this war.

01:28:12.974 --> 01:28:14.308
Come on.

01:28:44.593 --> 01:28:47.388
Maybe they're Limeys
and ain't got no cricket.

01:28:50.099 --> 01:28:52.101
They must be our guys.

01:28:55.647 --> 01:28:57.107
Okay.

01:29:19.257 --> 01:29:20.843
No.

01:29:36.361 --> 01:29:37.654
Hey.

01:29:38.738 --> 01:29:40.365
Hey, they were Germans.

01:29:50.961 --> 01:29:55.049
Hundreds of planes have been
flying to my left and right.

01:29:55.258 --> 01:29:56.926
Toward Caen.

01:29:59.887 --> 01:30:05.102
Now over the Cherbourg peninsula...
something must be happening!

01:30:05.352 --> 01:30:10.525
But what, Pluskat, what?
I haven't the faintest idea.

01:30:12.402 --> 01:30:16.115
Has anything been
observed on the beaches?

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:20.453
No... nothing.

01:30:21.495 --> 01:30:23.832
Yes, I'll let you know right away.

01:30:24.041 --> 01:30:25.417
Of course.

01:30:32.967 --> 01:30:35.428
Are you positive that ankle's broken?

01:30:35.636 --> 01:30:37.347
Compound fracture, sir.

01:30:37.556 --> 01:30:40.517
Well, put the boot back on
and lace it up...

01:30:40.726 --> 01:30:41.727
...tight.

01:30:41.935 --> 01:30:43.688
Don't get mad, I didn't break it.

01:30:43.897 --> 01:30:45.690
And you're not walking on it.

01:30:45.899 --> 01:30:50.237
- You're not going to try...
- Knock it off and do as you're told.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.542
Yes?

01:31:02.751 --> 01:31:05.963
A, B and C Company are scattered
all over like we are.

01:31:06.172 --> 01:31:07.507
Go on.

01:31:07.715 --> 01:31:11.845
Conklin landed on a stone wall, broke
his shoulder. I left him with a medic.

01:31:12.054 --> 01:31:13.680
Any contact with F Company?

01:31:13.889 --> 01:31:17.936
No, but they must be up ahead
in the direction of Sainte-Mère-Eglise.

01:31:18.978 --> 01:31:22.482
Well, go ahead. Tie it off.
Tie it off.

01:31:26.862 --> 01:31:28.489
Well, here's where we are.

01:31:28.697 --> 01:31:30.616
The northern edge of the swamp area...

01:31:30.825 --> 01:31:32.702
...five miles from our drop zone.

01:31:32.911 --> 01:31:34.746
Five miles.

01:31:35.539 --> 01:31:36.623
- F Company?
- No, sir.

01:31:36.832 --> 01:31:39.001
And we've got scouts
all over the place.

01:31:39.210 --> 01:31:41.254
We even picked up a group
from the 101.

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:45.425
F Company were the first
of the lead planes.

01:31:46.468 --> 01:31:48.262
Well, give me a hand.

01:31:57.731 --> 01:31:59.482
Can I have my rifle?

01:32:09.619 --> 01:32:11.913
Well, we'll head out this way.

01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:16.961
We ought to reach high ground
and open country by daybreak.

01:32:17.462 --> 01:32:19.714
All right. Have the men spread out...

01:32:19.922 --> 01:32:21.884
...pick up any stragglers
they can find.

01:32:22.092 --> 01:32:23.510
- Pass the word.
- Right, sir.

01:32:23.719 --> 01:32:26.680
All right, men, spread out.
Pick up stragglers you see.

01:32:26.889 --> 01:32:28.558
Pass the word down.

01:32:30.268 --> 01:32:31.644
All right...

01:32:31.978 --> 01:32:33.229
...let's go.

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:38.486
From the latest reports,
this is how I see it:

01:32:38.694 --> 01:32:41.782
American paratroopers have landed...

01:32:45.535 --> 01:32:47.162
British paratroopers...

01:32:49.457 --> 01:32:51.125
The invasion...

01:32:58.675 --> 01:33:00.511
Yes. Thank you, Pemsel.

01:33:01.345 --> 01:33:05.058
General Pemsel is convinced
that this is the invasion!

01:33:05.308 --> 01:33:10.189
I do not agree with him.
This is my conclusion:

01:33:10.439 --> 01:33:13.818
Normandy is the objective
of a diversionary attack.

01:33:14.026 --> 01:33:16.321
A diversionary attack, Blumentritt.

01:33:16.530 --> 01:33:20.575
It's not the main attack. That will
come at the Pas-de-Calais...

01:33:21.368 --> 01:33:23.162
...where it was always expected.

01:33:26.791 --> 01:33:28.626
Where we always expected it!

01:33:29.377 --> 01:33:31.880
But we can't take any chances.

01:33:32.089 --> 01:33:35.300
I want the reserve panzers
moved up at once!

01:33:35.551 --> 01:33:38.471
We need approval from the
Führer's headquarters.

01:33:38.721 --> 01:33:41.516
They wouldn't dare refuse me!

01:33:41.808 --> 01:33:46.856
Call the Führer's headquarters
and insist.

01:33:47.064 --> 01:33:51.570
Insist that the panzers be
released to me immediately!

01:33:56.408 --> 01:34:02.123
An invasion of Normandy would
be against all military logic.

01:34:03.291 --> 01:34:06.253
It would really be against all logic...

01:34:17.474 --> 01:34:19.435
Well, that about covers it, gentlemen.

01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:25.734
Most of you have had
your feet wet before:

01:34:26.234 --> 01:34:28.820
Dunkirk, Dieppe, Norway.

01:34:29.029 --> 01:34:31.907
And we know what it means
to be driven into the sea.

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:35.078
In a few hours
we're going back from the sea.

01:34:36.746 --> 01:34:38.915
And this time we're going to stay.

01:34:40.334 --> 01:34:42.377
There's no time
for any sob stuff about...

01:34:42.586 --> 01:34:44.880
...England, home and beauty.

01:34:46.508 --> 01:34:50.261
Remember, our people have had a
rough time for four and a half years.

01:34:51.596 --> 01:34:53.766
They've earned the final victory.

01:34:55.976 --> 01:34:57.603
Let's give it to them.

01:34:58.854 --> 01:35:01.858
And to our French comrades in arms,
I say:

01:35:02.109 --> 01:35:03.693
Good luck.

01:35:03.902 --> 01:35:05.904
Tomorrow morning, we'll take them.

01:35:15.332 --> 01:35:16.834
Come in, Teddy.

01:35:27.178 --> 01:35:28.973
Did you have to put it in writing?

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:31.642
I knew you wouldn't let me go
unless I did.

01:35:31.851 --> 01:35:33.894
You're putting me on the spot.

01:35:34.103 --> 01:35:36.731
- I didn't mean to, Tubby.
- The hell you didn't.

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:39.734
You put that request in writing,
made it official.

01:35:39.943 --> 01:35:42.530
You're the assistant division
commander.

01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:46.033
And that's why I'm supposed to go
ashore in the first wave.

01:35:46.242 --> 01:35:49.037
That's where I'm supposed to be.
You know that.

01:35:49.246 --> 01:35:50.914
You're important
to this operation.

01:35:51.123 --> 01:35:53.792
We can't have you knocked off
on the first day.

01:35:54.001 --> 01:35:56.337
But that's not the real reason.

01:35:56.546 --> 01:36:00.175
Isn't it because my father was
president of the United States?

01:36:00.425 --> 01:36:01.843
And a great president.

01:36:02.051 --> 01:36:03.846
And a great soldier.

01:36:04.054 --> 01:36:07.308
He led the charge of the Rough Riders
up San Juan Hill.

01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:11.938
So now you've got to be
the first man ashore on Utah Beach.

01:36:12.147 --> 01:36:15.901
But that's where I'm supposed to be,
Tubby. That's my job.

01:36:21.991 --> 01:36:26.038
Also, I've been there side by side
with the men all through training.

01:36:26.246 --> 01:36:30.376
They're used to seeing where I belong.
They have a right to expect me there.

01:36:31.002 --> 01:36:33.213
President's son or not.

01:36:35.882 --> 01:36:37.718
Is my request denied?

01:36:50.107 --> 01:36:51.984
No, you know it's not.

01:36:53.736 --> 01:36:57.031
Request reluctantly approved.

01:36:59.118 --> 01:37:00.661
Thanks, Tubby.

01:37:02.371 --> 01:37:03.664
Thanks a lot.

01:37:05.166 --> 01:37:06.251
Say...

01:37:06.459 --> 01:37:08.545
...how's that arthritis of yours?

01:37:09.087 --> 01:37:10.755
Arthritis?

01:37:11.422 --> 01:37:13.926
Haven't had a touch in months.

01:37:14.135 --> 01:37:15.469
Glad to hear it.

01:37:34.450 --> 01:37:35.659
The street...

01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:38.245
...the bridge...

01:37:39.121 --> 01:37:40.540
...the hotel...

01:37:42.459 --> 01:37:43.960
...the casino.

01:37:58.393 --> 01:37:59.770
One more thing...

01:38:01.647 --> 01:38:04.650
You have been fighting
everywhere for four years...

01:38:04.984 --> 01:38:10.240
...in Abyssinia, Libya, Egypt, Crete...

01:38:12.284 --> 01:38:15.371
But this time you are going
to fight on French soil...

01:38:15.955 --> 01:38:17.540
...in our fields...

01:38:18.625 --> 01:38:20.126
...in our villages...

01:38:22.213 --> 01:38:24.048
...under the eyes of our own people.

01:38:33.517 --> 01:38:38.022
The Führer took a sedative, I won't
wake him for these reports.

01:38:38.272 --> 01:38:43.195
First we hear that the paratroopers
are shot down plane crews.

01:38:43.403 --> 01:38:46.532
Next they are identified
as mechanical dummies.

01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:50.620
If paratroopers have landed...

01:38:50.829 --> 01:38:54.541
...it can only be a commando raid.

01:38:54.749 --> 01:38:59.338
Is that a sufficient reason to send
the panzers to the coast?

01:38:59.672 --> 01:39:04.803
I will submit all reports to the
Führer as soon as he awakens.

01:39:05.804 --> 01:39:07.556
I understand.

01:39:09.558 --> 01:39:11.394
Jodl has turned us down.

01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:18.694
He will not release the panzers
without the Führer's approval...

01:39:21.238 --> 01:39:24.200
...and the Führer is still asleep!

01:39:25.743 --> 01:39:27.954
Will you tell von Rundstedt?

01:39:31.333 --> 01:39:32.918
No, not now...

01:39:35.296 --> 01:39:37.089
Not now.

01:39:38.592 --> 01:39:40.343
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:39:56.778 --> 01:39:59.199
Sit down.

01:40:01.201 --> 01:40:03.453
This is history!

01:40:05.288 --> 01:40:08.959
We are living an historical moment.

01:40:10.461 --> 01:40:11.796
We are going to lose the war...

01:40:12.171 --> 01:40:17.010
...because the glorious Führer
has taken a sleeping pill...

01:40:18.678 --> 01:40:21.098
...and is not to be awakened.

01:40:22.183 --> 01:40:24.268
It's unbelievable.

01:40:24.477 --> 01:40:26.103
Think of it, Kurt.

01:40:27.815 --> 01:40:29.983
Don't ever forget it.

01:40:31.151 --> 01:40:34.113
We are witnessing something...

01:40:34.405 --> 01:40:38.493
...which historians will always
say is completely improbable...

01:40:38.701 --> 01:40:40.412
...and yet it is true.

01:40:43.958 --> 01:40:46.961
The Führer is not to be awakened!

01:40:47.963 --> 01:40:52.175
I sometimes wonder
whose side God is on.

01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:54.720
Can I...

01:40:56.013 --> 01:40:58.099
...bring you anything, sir?

01:41:01.937 --> 01:41:05.524
In my room there is a bottle
of excellent cognac...

01:41:05.732 --> 01:41:08.361
...Napoleon, unopened.

01:41:09.237 --> 01:41:12.365
I was even saving it for
a fitting occasion.

01:41:13.366 --> 01:41:18.205
This isn't exactly the right
occasion, but get it anyway.

01:41:43.735 --> 01:41:45.445
Daylight at last.

01:41:47.989 --> 01:41:50.826
A whole night wasted again!

01:41:58.752 --> 01:41:59.753
Where's my dog?

01:41:59.961 --> 01:42:02.047
He was here a minute ago.

01:42:07.804 --> 01:42:09.597
Let's have one last look.

01:42:15.687 --> 01:42:17.357
Not even a seagull...

01:42:27.117 --> 01:42:28.410
My God!

01:42:35.085 --> 01:42:36.545
The invasion.

01:42:38.046 --> 01:42:39.423
They're coming!

01:42:43.511 --> 01:42:48.308
It's the invasion! There must be
five thousand ships out there!

01:42:48.892 --> 01:42:51.395
Get hold of yourself, Pluskat.

01:42:53.231 --> 01:42:56.609
The enemy doesn't have
even half that many.

01:42:56.985 --> 01:43:01.031
Well dammit! Come and see
for yourself, you fool!

01:43:02.032 --> 01:43:03.659
It's amazing.

01:43:03.909 --> 01:43:06.329
It's beyond belief.

01:43:07.622 --> 01:43:11.334
My dear Pluskat, where are
these ships heading?

01:43:11.543 --> 01:43:13.212
Straight for me!

01:43:29.147 --> 01:43:31.858
General, in exactly two minutes...

01:43:32.066 --> 01:43:34.278
...the fleet will open fire.

01:43:35.070 --> 01:43:38.824
Your attention, please.
The Admiral has an announcement.

01:43:43.455 --> 01:43:46.166
Soon we shall be engaged in battle.

01:43:47.167 --> 01:43:52.131
To drive the enemy out, we must
fire on our homeland.

01:43:52.965 --> 01:43:55.177
This is the price of liberty.

01:43:56.303 --> 01:43:57.638
Long live France!

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:30.050
There he goes, right on time... as usual.

01:45:20.858 --> 01:45:25.071
They're landing!
They're coming! They're coming!

01:45:33.623 --> 01:45:35.791
I'm not crazy.
Look, they're landing!

01:45:36.042 --> 01:45:38.377
The Americans, the English
and the French!

01:46:14.211 --> 01:46:18.715
Do you hear me? What's the matter
with you? What's going on?

01:46:19.049 --> 01:46:21.719
You must be deaf! Can't you...?

01:46:22.846 --> 01:46:26.432
Dammit can't you hear
it for yourself?

01:46:29.895 --> 01:46:34.067
We're under fire. Yes, under fire!

01:46:39.406 --> 01:46:44.078
Those five thousand ships you
say the Allies haven't got...

01:46:44.412 --> 01:46:47.415
...well, they've got them!

01:46:58.970 --> 01:47:00.680
It's wonderful!

01:47:20.119 --> 01:47:22.121
Yes? What is it now?

01:47:22.330 --> 01:47:23.832
Listen to me, Pips.

01:47:24.041 --> 01:47:28.462
The invasion has started!
Put yourself on alert at once!

01:47:28.712 --> 01:47:32.467
What the hell can I do
with only two planes?

01:47:32.759 --> 01:47:35.178
Where are the others, you idiots?!

01:47:35.595 --> 01:47:40.142
Priller, that's an order! Get
ready at once! Understand?

01:47:40.351 --> 01:47:43.270
If it isn't too much trouble...

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:47.817
...would you tell me where
the invasion is?

01:47:48.985 --> 01:47:51.989
Normandy! How delightful!

01:47:52.198 --> 01:47:56.577
Thanks my faithful Hans.
That's the end for us! So long!

01:47:57.245 --> 01:48:00.832
It's getting very difficult to
get any sleep around here.

01:48:03.544 --> 01:48:08.841
Your prospects for a long sleep are
excellent. The invasion has begun.

01:48:11.094 --> 01:48:13.305
We're flying there, the two of us.

01:48:14.473 --> 01:48:16.225
Nobody else is left.

01:48:18.186 --> 01:48:20.021
I don't think we're coming back.

01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:33.980
The shelling has stopped.

01:49:37.818 --> 01:49:38.903
Landing craft approaching.

01:49:39.153 --> 01:49:43.534
Return to headquarters. Direct
your troops from there!

01:49:43.951 --> 01:49:46.119
Landing craft approaching the coast!

01:49:51.334 --> 01:49:53.711
Those French bastards!

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.839
Sergeant!

01:49:56.048 --> 01:49:59.343
Send this to headquarters by courier.

01:50:00.970 --> 01:50:05.225
No! Take it yourself. Tell
them our lines are cut!

01:50:05.433 --> 01:50:07.394
Gentlemen, come here please.

01:50:48.024 --> 01:50:51.820
There it is, men.
Omaha Beach, dead ahead.

01:50:52.779 --> 01:50:54.031
Lock on the target!

01:50:56.909 --> 01:50:58.661
Stand by!

01:52:03.694 --> 01:52:05.946
Get off of the beach!

01:52:06.196 --> 01:52:07.991
Let's go!

01:52:52.750 --> 01:52:53.918
Come on, move up!

01:53:12.898 --> 01:53:13.941
Hello, General, sir.

01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:16.026
Are you all right, boy?

01:53:16.235 --> 01:53:17.195
Yes, sir.

01:53:17.403 --> 01:53:20.531
Don't you think you better go
back and get your rifle?

01:53:21.282 --> 01:53:22.075
Out there, sir?

01:53:22.283 --> 01:53:25.204
You're almost sure to need it
before this day is over.

01:53:26.622 --> 01:53:27.539
Yes, sir.

01:53:43.432 --> 01:53:46.270
Come on! Move on up! Let's go.

01:53:53.611 --> 01:53:54.779
Medic!

01:53:54.988 --> 01:53:55.947
Medic!

01:54:16.804 --> 01:54:19.683
General, first reports
from Omaha, sir.

01:54:19.891 --> 01:54:21.226
"Assault teams have landed.

01:54:21.435 --> 01:54:24.271
No direct radio contact,
but destroyers report...

01:54:24.479 --> 01:54:27.609
...first and second waves
appear pinned down on the beach.

01:54:27.817 --> 01:54:30.737
Concentrated artillery
and mortar fire.

01:54:30.945 --> 01:54:34.700
Third wave floundering."
Heavy casualties, sir.

01:55:33.767 --> 01:55:35.895
When the mortars and machine guns
are silenced...

01:55:36.104 --> 01:55:38.273
...have the battalion commanders
join me...

01:55:38.982 --> 01:55:39.774
...over there.

01:55:40.024 --> 01:55:41.192
Okay.

01:55:41.401 --> 01:55:43.779
Hang on to that map case, Eddie.

01:56:13.896 --> 01:56:15.231
I made it.

01:56:17.776 --> 01:56:19.069
Hey, I made it.

01:56:19.403 --> 01:56:21.322
Did you see me get those two guys?

01:56:23.032 --> 01:56:24.492
Hey, Sergeant?

01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:29.956
Sergeant?

01:56:32.126 --> 01:56:35.838
As best as I can figure it,
this is the wrong beach.

01:56:36.047 --> 01:56:39.801
We're a mile and a quarter south
of where we were supposed to land.

01:56:40.010 --> 01:56:41.720
We should be up there.

01:56:42.012 --> 01:56:45.099
Control boat must've been confused
by the naval bombardment smoke.

01:56:45.558 --> 01:56:47.769
I agree with you,
but what will we do now?

01:56:47.977 --> 01:56:51.105
Our reinforcements and heavy equipment
will approach in a very few minutes.

01:56:51.314 --> 01:56:54.526
- I know, I know.
- What if they land at the right beach?

01:57:03.954 --> 01:57:07.333
The reinforcements will have to
follow us wherever we are.

01:57:09.043 --> 01:57:10.920
We're starting the war from right here.

01:57:12.046 --> 01:57:15.092
- Head inland. We're going inland.
- Okay, let's go.

01:57:33.112 --> 01:57:35.657
Follow me. Do everything I do!

01:57:39.369 --> 01:57:41.789
All right. Let's go!

01:58:27.841 --> 01:58:30.178
Head for home!

01:58:31.763 --> 01:58:35.141
The Luftwaffe has had its great moment!

01:58:45.362 --> 01:58:46.738
Stand by to beach.

01:58:46.947 --> 01:58:48.990
Duncan, take care of that strongpoint.

01:58:49.574 --> 01:58:52.578
Any minute now. Stand by!

01:58:52.828 --> 01:58:54.997
Let's give it them back for Dunkirk!

01:58:55.498 --> 01:58:58.210
You hear that? Dunkirk.
Do you hear it, Clough?

01:58:58.418 --> 01:59:00.462
Sure he was at school at the time.

01:59:02.923 --> 01:59:05.009
Come on, you bums!

01:59:05.802 --> 01:59:09.764
Come out, you dirty slobs!
Flanagan's back!

01:59:12.977 --> 01:59:16.230
The evil of it all. Drowning a man
before he fights.

01:59:16.438 --> 01:59:17.398
Oh, come on!

01:59:53.064 --> 01:59:55.567
Keep those vehicles moving!

01:59:55.775 --> 01:59:59.322
MP, chase out those cyclists.

02:00:02.033 --> 02:00:04.368
Get off the beach! Move inland!

02:00:06.163 --> 02:00:07.539
Come on, you lot!

02:00:07.748 --> 02:00:09.207
Hurry it up.

02:00:12.669 --> 02:00:14.380
Never mind the blathering!

02:00:14.589 --> 02:00:16.549
We must put these down somewhere.

02:00:16.758 --> 02:00:18.593
The sooner you get off the beach...

02:00:18.801 --> 02:00:21.639
...the sooner they'll stop
this blasted shelling.

02:00:21.847 --> 02:00:23.891
It's very bad for the dog!

02:00:26.727 --> 02:00:28.563
Down, Winston, down!

02:00:29.606 --> 02:00:32.233
Beach Master Sword, Section 2-A.

02:00:32.442 --> 02:00:35.738
Third wave ashore on time.
No obstruction to follow-up.

02:00:35.946 --> 02:00:37.531
Standing by.

02:00:38.949 --> 02:00:40.493
Get going!

02:00:40.869 --> 02:00:43.538
For heaven's sake,
get that carrier off the beach!

02:00:43.747 --> 02:00:46.917
I was told I could transmit
a newsflash on your radio.

02:00:47.125 --> 02:00:49.587
If you can't drive it, carry it!

02:00:50.421 --> 02:00:51.422
You were saying?

02:00:51.631 --> 02:00:54.300
I was told I could transmit
a newsflash on your...

02:00:54.509 --> 02:00:57.930
My dear fellow, I don't want
to appear uncooperative...

02:00:58.180 --> 02:01:00.766
Yes, I know all about
the power of the press.

02:01:00.975 --> 02:01:04.604
But this line happens
to be rather busy! Come on!

02:01:08.693 --> 02:01:10.444
Down, Winston. Down, Winston.

02:01:13.406 --> 02:01:14.615
What did he say?

02:01:14.865 --> 02:01:16.535
The answer is no.

02:01:16.785 --> 02:01:18.578
We have to use the damn pigeons.

02:01:18.787 --> 02:01:20.497
I've got these ready.

02:01:21.039 --> 02:01:22.667
Here, clip this on.

02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:38.893
They're going the wrong way.

02:01:39.102 --> 02:01:41.104
Not toward the Germans, you idiots!

02:01:41.313 --> 02:01:44.442
The other way! The other way!

02:01:44.650 --> 02:01:46.360
Damned traitors!

02:01:46.569 --> 02:01:49.280
- Hold it.
- Can't you get your finger out?

02:01:49.488 --> 02:01:50.449
What's the matter?

02:01:50.657 --> 02:01:54.036
Engine won't start, sir.
Full of seawater, I think.

02:01:55.495 --> 02:01:57.080
My old grandmother used to say...

02:01:57.290 --> 02:02:00.001
...anything mechanical,
give it a good bash.

02:02:00.585 --> 02:02:01.544
Try it now.

02:02:05.007 --> 02:02:06.050
Thank you, sir.

02:02:06.258 --> 02:02:07.760
Off you go. Good luck.

02:02:12.682 --> 02:02:14.059
I'm sure that got it out.

02:02:16.019 --> 02:02:18.189
That's what I call a hell of a man!

02:02:18.397 --> 02:02:20.608
Aye, I like his dog too.

02:02:21.651 --> 02:02:23.444
Don't stand there yapping!

02:02:23.653 --> 02:02:26.406
This isn't Hyde Park Corner!
The war's over there!

02:02:28.992 --> 02:02:30.035
Come along!

02:02:30.243 --> 02:02:31.495
Come on!

02:02:32.246 --> 02:02:35.291
- Thank you.
- Everything's going according to plan.

02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:38.796
Stand by to move.
Millin, "Blue Bonnet."

02:02:49.975 --> 02:02:52.185
What in God's name...?

02:02:56.357 --> 02:03:00.153
Oh, my friends. What a day!
What a day!

02:03:00.445 --> 02:03:02.739
Welcome to France.
Welcome to Colleville!

02:03:02.948 --> 02:03:05.117
Most kind of you.
Very nice to meet you...

02:03:05.367 --> 02:03:07.495
Look at this. I kept it for you all.

02:03:07.704 --> 02:03:10.540
But I don't think there
will be enough for everyone.

02:03:10.748 --> 02:03:14.837
Perhaps next time. We have
a previous engagement: The war!

02:03:15.838 --> 02:03:17.506
Mustn't lose that champagne!

02:03:17.756 --> 02:03:20.885
All right, men, fall in!
Millin, "Blue Bonnet."

02:03:22.512 --> 02:03:23.847
Goodbye.

02:03:25.473 --> 02:03:28.352
Thank you, boys! Thank you!

02:03:34.108 --> 02:03:36.862
Long live France!
Long live the Allies!

02:03:38.071 --> 02:03:39.364
If you ask me, Flanagan...

02:03:39.573 --> 02:03:43.036
...there's a lot of very
peculiar blokes on this beach.

02:03:44.412 --> 02:03:45.955
Welcome!

02:03:46.831 --> 02:03:48.584
Welcome to you all!

02:05:40.170 --> 02:05:43.423
Thank you, dear, they're lovely!

02:05:45.508 --> 02:05:48.179
Better try them on first.

02:05:52.683 --> 02:05:54.144
Rommel speaking.

02:05:54.353 --> 02:05:55.812
Good morning.

02:05:56.730 --> 02:05:58.106
What?

02:05:58.732 --> 02:06:00.109
What!

02:06:00.777 --> 02:06:02.153
Where?

02:06:02.612 --> 02:06:03.654
Normandy!

02:06:04.697 --> 02:06:06.949
Have they a foothold already?

02:06:07.409 --> 02:06:10.079
They must be thrown back!

02:06:10.662 --> 02:06:12.790
What about the panzer reserves?

02:06:13.874 --> 02:06:17.253
Did von Rundstedt obtain
their release from the Führer?

02:06:28.725 --> 02:06:30.185
Normandy!

02:06:34.356 --> 02:06:36.025
How stupid of me!

02:06:52.085 --> 02:06:53.503
There it is.

02:07:04.891 --> 02:07:07.561
You mean to tell me
that's all we gotta climb?

02:07:07.769 --> 02:07:10.023
They're not as high
as the practice ones.

02:07:10.231 --> 02:07:12.025
They wasn't shooting at us then.

02:07:13.609 --> 02:07:16.029
Why can't the Air Force
or Navy do this job?

02:07:16.237 --> 02:07:20.034
The big guns in bunkers behind the
cliff can't be seen from the air.

02:07:20.242 --> 02:07:23.496
We knock them out or they'll
murder our guys on the beach.

02:07:23.705 --> 02:07:25.457
Yeah, well if you ask me...

02:07:25.665 --> 02:07:28.626
...three grandmothers with brooms
could sweep us off there...

02:07:28.835 --> 02:07:30.796
...like flies off of a sugar cake.

02:14:06.207 --> 02:14:08.084
That's it, the one we're after.

02:15:05.024 --> 02:15:06.442
It's empty.

02:15:06.901 --> 02:15:10.322
The Air Force and Navy
really plastered this baby.

02:15:10.530 --> 02:15:11.948
But I don't get...

02:15:12.866 --> 02:15:14.242
The guns.

02:15:14.951 --> 02:15:16.537
There ain't no mounts.

02:15:17.371 --> 02:15:19.540
They've never even been installed.

02:15:20.917 --> 02:15:22.126
You mean...

02:15:23.003 --> 02:15:25.964
...we come up all this way...

02:15:26.173 --> 02:15:27.758
...for nothing?

02:15:32.806 --> 02:15:34.974
Don't worry, sarge,
you'll be all right.

02:15:35.183 --> 02:15:37.478
Medic! Medic!

02:15:46.446 --> 02:15:48.865
I wonder what "bitte, bitte" means?

02:15:59.336 --> 02:16:03.090
What the hell are you
wearing a life preserver for?

02:16:03.674 --> 02:16:05.468
I can't swim.

02:16:13.561 --> 02:16:18.108
Normandy. It really is Normandy.

02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:22.863
This is madness... madness...
sheer madness!

02:16:26.409 --> 02:16:30.663
I just talked to General Jodl...
the Führer is awake.

02:16:30.872 --> 02:16:36.462
I don't care if he's awake or not!
What about the reserve panzers?

02:16:37.296 --> 02:16:41.800
The Führer went into
one of his tantrums...

02:16:42.385 --> 02:16:45.180
...and no one dared
bring up the subject.

02:16:45.723 --> 02:16:47.892
They're still held in reserve!

02:16:48.517 --> 02:16:50.644
Yes, Field Marshal.

02:16:54.191 --> 02:16:56.651
Sir, if you would call
the Führer yourself...

02:16:57.067 --> 02:17:00.406
...I am convinced he would
respect your views.

02:17:00.698 --> 02:17:02.241
Call him?

02:17:02.450 --> 02:17:05.327
Call that Bohemian corporal?!

02:17:06.245 --> 02:17:09.625
Crawl on my knees to him?!

02:17:10.250 --> 02:17:12.920
No! It is out of the question!

02:17:16.424 --> 02:17:22.056
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

02:17:22.473 --> 02:17:23.557
What's that?

02:17:23.808 --> 02:17:27.102
Nothing... nothing of importance.

02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:30.690
Here, let me help you.

02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:35.071
You all right, Tom?
Come on, they're up there.

02:17:39.367 --> 02:17:41.286
- Sir.
- Well?

02:17:41.577 --> 02:17:44.915
Mr. Smith says to tell you
he's stood his men too.

02:17:45.124 --> 02:17:47.291
The Jerries are moving up
into the woods...

02:17:47.543 --> 02:17:49.462
...with machine guns and mortars.

02:17:50.338 --> 02:17:53.383
- Tell the men to stand firm!
- Tell the chaps...

02:17:53.591 --> 02:17:56.679
Tell them to expect another
counterattack, a heavy one.

02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:03.145
- Here you are, mate.
- Ta.

02:18:07.148 --> 02:18:08.150
What's the matter?

02:18:08.358 --> 02:18:10.945
Listen. I thought I heard bagpipes.

02:18:11.154 --> 02:18:12.989
Don't be daft!

02:18:21.707 --> 02:18:24.878
I told you I heard bagpipes!
It's the reinforcements.

02:18:39.019 --> 02:18:40.102
It's Lovat!

02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:49.405
Come on!

02:18:49.947 --> 02:18:51.450
Come on!

02:19:18.439 --> 02:19:20.566
- Sorry I'm late.
- Better than never, sir.

02:19:20.775 --> 02:19:22.192
Glad to see you, Shimmy.

02:19:26.906 --> 02:19:30.076
You boys are right on target.
What's the situation?

02:19:30.285 --> 02:19:33.248
Jerry's regrouping in the woods,
about a mile.

02:19:33.581 --> 02:19:35.375
With mortars and machine guns.

02:19:35.583 --> 02:19:36.543
Numbers?

02:19:36.751 --> 02:19:40.589
No idea, Shimmy, but they seem
to be moving forward in force.

02:19:42.466 --> 02:19:44.093
In that case, we won't wait.

02:19:44.885 --> 02:19:46.304
We'd better get moving.

02:19:46.972 --> 02:19:48.890
All right, we're going across.

02:19:49.099 --> 02:19:50.308
- Millin!
- Sir?

02:19:51.143 --> 02:19:52.769
"Black Bear," sir.

02:19:53.229 --> 02:19:55.481
All right, come on.

02:19:55.690 --> 02:19:57.150
Everybody up!

02:19:57.650 --> 02:19:59.110
On your feet!

02:20:05.492 --> 02:20:08.621
There he goes. He's at it again.

02:20:08.997 --> 02:20:11.749
Ever hear such a bleeding racket
in all your life?

02:20:11.958 --> 02:20:14.712
Yeah, it takes an Irishman
to play the pipes.

02:20:30.313 --> 02:20:32.482
<i>Hold until relieved.</i>

02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:34.442
<i>Hold until relieved.</i>

02:20:36.862 --> 02:20:41.701
North by east, north by east.
Sainte-Mère-Eglise is that way.

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:44.078
Somebody turned that sign around.

02:20:44.287 --> 02:20:47.999
Doesn't anybody in this outfit
look at a compass besides me?

02:20:48.417 --> 02:20:49.752
Hey, you guys!

02:20:50.002 --> 02:20:53.672
Over here! Over here!

02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:56.885
Over here, on the double.

02:20:59.554 --> 02:21:01.890
- Where you taking that?
- We don't know, sir.

02:21:02.098 --> 02:21:03.976
We took the wrong road.

02:21:04.852 --> 02:21:06.604
What do you got in here, ammo?

02:21:06.854 --> 02:21:08.147
Yes, sir.

02:21:08.523 --> 02:21:09.483
You 82nd?

02:21:09.691 --> 02:21:11.235
No, sir, 101.

02:21:11.443 --> 02:21:14.112
Well, you're in the 82nd now.

02:21:15.239 --> 02:21:17.367
- But, sir, we're...
- But what?

02:21:17.575 --> 02:21:18.952
Nothing, sir.

02:21:19.869 --> 02:21:21.704
All right, move out.

02:21:25.376 --> 02:21:27.628
- Knock that sign down!
- Yes, sir.

02:21:33.969 --> 02:21:37.807
- Something's moving up there, colonel.
- Hit the dirt! Take cover.

02:21:41.018 --> 02:21:42.979
Lieutenant Sheen, sir, A Company.

02:21:45.315 --> 02:21:47.609
Colonel, it's me!

02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:52.490
- Where did you come from?
- Sainte-Mère-Eglise.

02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:55.451
We hold the main road
and north side of the square.

02:21:55.702 --> 02:21:58.831
The Germans have a battery
on the other side of the town...

02:21:59.039 --> 02:22:01.584
...and command the countryside.
- And Major Lance?

02:22:01.792 --> 02:22:05.505
- Holed up in a building in the square.
- F Company?

02:22:06.214 --> 02:22:09.885
They overshot the drop zone
and landed in the middle of the town.

02:22:10.093 --> 02:22:11.136
Go on.

02:22:11.386 --> 02:22:14.223
It was a nightmare, sir. A slaughter.

02:22:14.474 --> 02:22:17.101
They were mowed down
before they hit the ground.

02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:24.109
Major Lance sent me to try
and contact you, sir.

02:22:24.318 --> 02:22:27.906
He wants your permission to pull back
and regroup outside of town.

02:22:30.742 --> 02:22:35.498
No, damn it. We came here
to take Sainte-Mère-Eglise.

02:22:35.706 --> 02:22:37.625
We're gonna take it and hold it.

02:22:38.959 --> 02:22:41.421
Follow the lieutenant, gentlemen.

02:22:52.391 --> 02:22:54.770
- Sir.
- Thank you.

02:22:56.104 --> 02:22:59.983
British and Canadians advancing
steadily from Sword, Gold, and Juno.

02:23:03.321 --> 02:23:05.198
Anything from Omaha?

02:23:05.448 --> 02:23:09.662
Nothing since the first message:
Heavy fighting, heavy casualties.

02:23:09.870 --> 02:23:11.080
Sir.

02:23:14.417 --> 02:23:15.669
Omaha?

02:23:17.504 --> 02:23:18.547
No.

02:23:22.176 --> 02:23:26.013
I can't understand why Jerry hasn't
brought his heavy armor into play.

02:23:26.848 --> 02:23:29.476
All the panzer divisions
except the 21 st...

02:23:29.726 --> 02:23:32.271
...seem to be sitting it out
in the rear.

02:23:32.855 --> 02:23:33.897
Sir.

02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:40.822
French commandos driving inland
from Sword...

02:23:41.072 --> 02:23:43.367
...have reached the outskirts
of Ouistreham.

02:23:44.034 --> 02:23:45.578
Ouistreham.

02:26:36.315 --> 02:26:38.067
Fall back!

02:26:40.861 --> 02:26:42.489
Take cover!

02:26:58.215 --> 02:27:02.302
Tank support!
We must have tank support!

02:27:48.856 --> 02:27:50.566
I can't get them!

02:27:50.900 --> 02:27:53.028
Keep trying! We must have support!

02:27:53.653 --> 02:27:58.033
Hold your positions...
I'm going for a tank!

02:27:59.327 --> 02:28:01.787
Give us as much cover as you can!

02:28:49.884 --> 02:28:51.261
Fire!

02:28:56.308 --> 02:28:57.685
Try for the cannon!

02:29:03.275 --> 02:29:05.735
Get the wounded out of here!

02:29:33.767 --> 02:29:34.810
Go back!

02:29:35.644 --> 02:29:37.022
Get out of here!

02:29:56.084 --> 02:29:58.254
You can't stay here!

02:29:58.463 --> 02:30:01.257
I am Mother Superior of the convent.

02:30:01.466 --> 02:30:03.969
The sisters are qualified nurses.

02:30:04.178 --> 02:30:09.391
But Madame... I mean, Mother,
we're in the middle of a battle!

02:30:12.395 --> 02:30:14.356
Take care of the wounded.

02:30:49.896 --> 02:30:50.939
It's a tank!

02:30:53.693 --> 02:30:55.111
It's Kieffer!

02:31:05.414 --> 02:31:07.542
In the other direction!

02:31:18.387 --> 02:31:21.808
Clear away the debris! Hurry!

02:31:58.808 --> 02:32:01.228
But where is the Luftwaffe?!

02:32:01.436 --> 02:32:02.438
I'm trying...

02:32:02.688 --> 02:32:04.607
Yeah, yeah, you're trying.

02:32:12.699 --> 02:32:17.413
The British troops have a beachhead
here. They are moving inland.

02:32:17.622 --> 02:32:23.504
The Americans hold Ste-Mère-Eglise
and have cut the highway.

02:32:23.712 --> 02:32:26.840
We control this center section.

02:32:27.383 --> 02:32:32.722
The Americans have landed but
their attack has bogged down.

02:32:33.390 --> 02:32:36.268
Rommel is right...

02:32:36.519 --> 02:32:39.981
If we can hold them on the beaches...

02:32:40.231 --> 02:32:42.233
...the invasion will collapse.

02:33:19.109 --> 02:33:20.235
That thing still work?

02:33:20.444 --> 02:33:22.613
Yes, sir, now and then.

02:33:22.821 --> 02:33:25.366
- Anything from the other beaches?
- Not directly.

02:33:25.575 --> 02:33:29.120
A while ago the sergeant picked up
some flashes from the destroyers.

02:33:29.996 --> 02:33:34.209
The 4th Division is off Utah Beach
and moving inland.

02:33:34.418 --> 02:33:35.794
Inland?

02:33:38.213 --> 02:33:41.343
- What about the 1 st Division?
- They're hung up, sir.

02:33:41.551 --> 02:33:43.011
Like we are.

02:33:47.433 --> 02:33:48.809
Move out.

02:34:08.082 --> 02:34:10.459
- What do you think?
- Think?

02:34:11.377 --> 02:34:14.673
We must have close to a thousand
casualties up to now.

02:34:14.881 --> 02:34:17.550
Do you want me to have the ships
start picking us up?

02:34:18.343 --> 02:34:20.972
- You think it's that bad?
- I don't see what else to do.

02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:23.099
We can't get up this hill.

02:34:23.307 --> 02:34:26.018
If we don't get off this beach,
we won't have any division left.

02:34:26.227 --> 02:34:27.228
What?

02:34:28.313 --> 02:34:30.107
These are our men, Tom.

02:34:30.315 --> 02:34:34.404
You think we brought them in so some
die and ask the rest to turn tail?

02:34:34.612 --> 02:34:37.407
Hell, no.
We're gonna get up that hill.

02:34:37.615 --> 02:34:40.201
Find me somebody to speak
for the Rangers.

02:34:40.410 --> 02:34:43.163
Back down the beach
on the right there's a gully.

02:34:43.497 --> 02:34:48.461
With a heavily defended roadblock
and machine gun nests on both sides.

02:34:48.670 --> 02:34:51.798
- If we can blow our way through...
- We've hit it three times.

02:34:52.007 --> 02:34:54.467
- We didn't get close.
- Three times isn't enough.

02:34:54.718 --> 02:34:58.097
We're gonna hit it again.
Can you find me some engineers?

02:34:58.306 --> 02:34:59.265
They're all around you!

02:34:59.473 --> 02:35:01.809
I mean engineers
with equipment still working.

02:35:03.604 --> 02:35:05.439
Then I shouldn't radio the ships?

02:35:05.647 --> 02:35:06.898
No, damn it!

02:35:07.107 --> 02:35:11.195
We need bangalore torpedoes,
bazookas, mortars, wire cutters...

02:35:11.446 --> 02:35:14.115
...and every man that can stand.
Pass the word, will you?

02:35:15.909 --> 02:35:17.328
Okay, Norm.

02:35:33.930 --> 02:35:36.349
Now listen to me, all of you.

02:35:37.059 --> 02:35:39.353
You guys got to snap out of it.

02:35:39.603 --> 02:35:42.481
We're getting off of here,
and we're going inland.

02:35:42.731 --> 02:35:45.693
What about weapons, General?
My men lost everything.

02:35:45.902 --> 02:35:48.321
They gotta have something
to fight with.

02:35:48.529 --> 02:35:50.365
Strip the dead and the wounded.

02:35:50.573 --> 02:35:52.576
Pick up anything that'll shoot.

02:35:52.785 --> 02:35:55.496
I don't have to tell you the score,
you all know it.

02:35:55.704 --> 02:35:58.667
Only two kinds of people
are gonna stay on this beach:

02:35:58.875 --> 02:36:02.837
Those that are already dead and those
that will die. Get off your butts!

02:36:03.046 --> 02:36:05.758
You guys are the fighting 29th!

02:36:23.278 --> 02:36:25.029
I've looked at the naval reports.

02:36:25.238 --> 02:36:26.365
Yes?

02:36:27.199 --> 02:36:31.328
According to reports from the offshore
destroyers, Omaha is a shambles.

02:36:31.787 --> 02:36:34.541
There's no evidence...
To quote the report exactly:

02:36:34.749 --> 02:36:39.087
"There is no evidence of any movement
that can be observed off the beach."

02:36:41.090 --> 02:36:42.842
I'd better have a look through these.

02:36:46.430 --> 02:36:47.889
How is Ike taking it?

02:36:48.098 --> 02:36:51.893
Like everybody else, sir.
Hanging on by his fingernails.

02:36:54.272 --> 02:36:58.026
No, no! We must regroup
according to Plan Six!

02:37:04.908 --> 02:37:06.201
Can you hear me?

02:37:06.410 --> 02:37:09.914
I said we must regroup
according to Plan Six.

02:37:10.915 --> 02:37:12.751
Nonsense!

02:37:12.959 --> 02:37:16.255
If the panzers arrive, we still
have time to use them.

02:37:19.884 --> 02:37:22.012
We'll drive to the coast!

02:37:22.387 --> 02:37:24.306
Shall we remove the files?

02:37:24.723 --> 02:37:29.312
I don't care! I want to get to the
front at once... to Normandy!

02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:30.647
Yes, General.

02:37:58.011 --> 02:38:00.347
- Where is everybody?
- What?

02:38:02.767 --> 02:38:04.978
I said, where is everybody?

02:38:07.438 --> 02:38:09.399
I can't hear you.

02:38:10.651 --> 02:38:12.528
It's them bells.

02:38:12.736 --> 02:38:15.614
I've had them in my ears
for 10 hours.

02:38:15.823 --> 02:38:18.827
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

02:38:20.620 --> 02:38:22.914
Hey, Sergeant, where's Major Lance?

02:38:23.123 --> 02:38:25.459
We moved the CP to that
building. The major's there.

02:38:25.668 --> 02:38:27.545
Get him, the colonel's here.

02:38:29.046 --> 02:38:30.214
What?

02:38:32.217 --> 02:38:33.427
Hold it!

02:38:44.063 --> 02:38:46.317
Colonel, am I glad to see you!

02:38:47.443 --> 02:38:50.571
Those bodies. Get those bodies down.

02:38:50.779 --> 02:38:53.199
Why are you leaving them up there?
Get them down!

02:38:53.408 --> 02:38:55.201
But we've been under fire, sir.

02:38:55.410 --> 02:38:57.412
I know you have, but I don't care!

02:38:57.621 --> 02:38:59.832
Get them down! Down!

02:39:00.207 --> 02:39:04.170
- I don't want those boys left there.
- Take a detail and cut them down.

02:39:04.378 --> 02:39:06.256
- At once!
- Yes, sir.

02:39:10.469 --> 02:39:15.141
Has there been a linkup between our
forces and the troops from the sea?

02:39:15.350 --> 02:39:19.605
I don't know, Major. I don't even
know if the landings took place.

02:39:19.813 --> 02:39:24.610
But I am sure we're gonna hold
this town until the linkup does come.

02:39:24.818 --> 02:39:29.366
Whenever that is, today, tomorrow,
till hell freezes over.

02:39:30.951 --> 02:39:32.870
For their sake,
if for no other reason.

02:39:33.079 --> 02:39:35.581
Show me the enemy positions.

02:39:35.790 --> 02:39:38.668
Well, sir, the Germans' strong point
is right there.

02:39:38.876 --> 02:39:41.713
That's over there on the hill.
They've got no tanks yet.

02:39:41.922 --> 02:39:46.009
They've got heavy guns and machine
gun positions at the top of that road.

02:39:46.218 --> 02:39:48.054
How many men have you got?

02:39:48.805 --> 02:39:49.764
Not enough.

02:39:50.014 --> 02:39:53.894
Lt. Wilson will take A Company
and reinforce Major Lance.

02:39:54.561 --> 02:39:59.316
The rest of the command will follow us
straight up that road.

02:40:00.568 --> 02:40:01.653
Good luck, Major.

02:40:01.861 --> 02:40:04.447
All right, A Company, fall out.

02:40:04.656 --> 02:40:06.741
- Private.
- Yes, sir.

02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:08.119
It's a helluva war.

02:40:08.327 --> 02:40:10.871
It's a privilege to serve
with you, colonel.

02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:15.127
Well, God willing, we'll do
what we came here to do.

02:40:15.335 --> 02:40:17.212
Ready, sir.

02:40:17.504 --> 02:40:19.214
Move out!

02:40:29.476 --> 02:40:33.022
The old man sure has changed
since yesterday.

02:40:38.903 --> 02:40:41.197
Or maybe it's just
that we've changed...

02:40:42.283 --> 02:40:43.909
...since yesterday.

02:40:51.668 --> 02:40:54.296
Lovat and his commandos
have reached the bridge.

02:40:55.422 --> 02:40:56.883
Bob, did you hear?

02:40:57.550 --> 02:40:59.135
Yes, I heard.

02:41:00.511 --> 02:41:05.059
"Sainte-Mère-Eglise captured
by units of the 82nd Airborne."

02:41:06.894 --> 02:41:09.730
"101 Airborne driving on Utah."

02:41:09.939 --> 02:41:12.651
That's good. Good.

02:41:13.068 --> 02:41:17.990
Yes, but if we can't get off Omaha
it doesn't mean a damn. We know it.

02:41:18.199 --> 02:41:21.661
We'll have two cut-off beachheads,
one in British zone and one at Utah.

02:41:21.869 --> 02:41:22.912
Yes...

02:41:23.245 --> 02:41:25.415
...and the Germans in between.

02:41:40.891 --> 02:41:42.726
You guys engineers?

02:41:44.144 --> 02:41:45.897
Yes, sir. 299th.

02:41:46.106 --> 02:41:49.025
Where are your officers?
Who's in charge here?

02:41:49.609 --> 02:41:52.113
I guess I am, sir.
None of our officers made it in.

02:41:52.321 --> 02:41:54.365
What about your equipment?
Those torpedoes work?

02:41:54.573 --> 02:41:56.575
Yes, sir, we'll make them work!

02:41:57.952 --> 02:42:00.622
- What's your name, Sergeant?
- It's Fuller, sir, John H.

02:42:00.956 --> 02:42:04.459
You're Lieutenant Fuller from now on,
whether you like it or not.

02:42:07.005 --> 02:42:10.550
You send some men down to the foot
of that gully with those torpedoes.

02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:12.511
You and the rest of the men follow me.

02:42:12.761 --> 02:42:14.555
Yes, sir!

02:42:14.805 --> 02:42:18.350
All right, men!
Let's move that equipment down here.

02:42:24.733 --> 02:42:28.154
- I got a rifle, sir.
- Well, good for you, son!

02:42:28.821 --> 02:42:30.156
The Rangers are ready, General.

02:42:30.364 --> 02:42:32.867
Okay, Major, move them out.

02:42:33.075 --> 02:42:35.829
Captain, move them up.

02:42:36.038 --> 02:42:38.248
Move them up!

02:42:40.460 --> 02:42:42.337
- Well, Tom?
- We're ready.

02:42:42.545 --> 02:42:44.172
As ready as we'll ever be.

02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:47.217
It'll work. It's got to work.

02:42:49.011 --> 02:42:53.390
We're getting murdered here! We might
as well move inland and get murdered!

02:42:57.395 --> 02:42:58.980
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

02:42:59.189 --> 02:43:01.859
You're gonna blow
that roadblock for me.

02:43:02.068 --> 02:43:04.612
When I give the word
everything pops at once. Okay?

02:43:04.862 --> 02:43:05.738
Yes, sir.

02:43:33.353 --> 02:43:36.983
First, we gotta blow a hole
through that wire with bangalores.

02:43:37.233 --> 02:43:40.069
If that works, we'll pack
everything we've got into that wall.

02:43:42.321 --> 02:43:43.907
All right, let's go!

02:46:43.613 --> 02:46:48.201
All right, let's go! Go! Go!

02:47:47.519 --> 02:47:51.148
We must leave. The main highway
is under aerial attack.

02:47:51.356 --> 02:47:53.026
You don't say!

02:49:30.554 --> 02:49:32.013
Don't worry, Yank.

02:49:37.186 --> 02:49:38.271
He's dead.

02:49:59.795 --> 02:50:03.674
Give me a cigarette.
I'm dying for a cigarette.

02:50:11.559 --> 02:50:13.019
You hurt bad?

02:50:16.939 --> 02:50:18.942
Shot down during the night.

02:50:22.905 --> 02:50:27.077
He was gonna make sure of me,
but I got him...

02:50:27.494 --> 02:50:28.953
...with this.

02:50:39.591 --> 02:50:43.553
You ever killed a man?
I mean, face to face?

02:50:45.389 --> 02:50:46.391
No.

02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:51.270
Neither had I, face to face.

02:50:54.817 --> 02:50:57.277
I've been sitting here looking at him.

02:50:58.904 --> 02:51:01.616
Have you noticed anything peculiar
about him?

02:51:11.502 --> 02:51:12.628
No.

02:51:14.339 --> 02:51:16.091
He's got his boots...

02:51:16.425 --> 02:51:18.593
...on the wrong feet.

02:51:26.144 --> 02:51:28.105
He must have been
in a big hurry, huh?

02:51:30.315 --> 02:51:31.567
Is it bad?

02:51:34.445 --> 02:51:36.322
Split wide open...

02:51:37.532 --> 02:51:39.743
...from the crotch to the knee.

02:51:40.452 --> 02:51:44.457
A medic came along and gave me
a shot of morphine.

02:51:47.168 --> 02:51:49.755
I hope he'll be back
before it wears off.

02:51:50.922 --> 02:51:52.299
He said he would.

02:51:55.260 --> 02:51:56.971
Did he sew you up?

02:52:00.808 --> 02:52:04.563
Well, when he came to shore
he lost most of his equipment.

02:52:07.524 --> 02:52:09.360
So he pinned it together...

02:52:10.403 --> 02:52:12.489
...with safety pins.

02:52:24.086 --> 02:52:25.670
Getting on toward night.

02:52:33.846 --> 02:52:35.139
You know something?

02:52:36.682 --> 02:52:38.685
I haven't fired my gun all day.

02:52:39.186 --> 02:52:42.981
I keep hearing shooting, but every
time I get there, everybody's gone.

02:52:46.861 --> 02:52:48.321
Funny, isn't it?

02:52:49.697 --> 02:52:50.950
He's dead.

02:52:52.201 --> 02:52:53.828
I'm crippled.

02:52:54.995 --> 02:52:56.664
You're lost.

02:52:59.209 --> 02:53:01.086
I suppose it's always like that.

02:53:03.046 --> 02:53:04.589
I mean war.

02:53:12.099 --> 02:53:13.934
I wonder who won.

02:53:56.816 --> 02:53:59.486
Okay, run me up the hill, son.

02:54:00.305 --> 02:54:06.877
