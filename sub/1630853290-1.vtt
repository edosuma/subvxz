00:20.482 --> 00:22.150
When we are
told all of our lives

00:22.192 --> 00:26.483
that there are only two
possibilities, either, or,

00:26.525 --> 00:29.150
it can be hard to
look beyond that.

00:29.192 --> 00:31.608
Some of us think
outside the box.

00:31.650 --> 00:32.691
But for many of us,

00:32.733 --> 00:35.440
the box becomes our world.

00:35.482 --> 00:38.357
There is no outside the box.

00:49.567 --> 00:50.441
If someone had told me

00:50.483 --> 00:53.650
I'd play myself in a
movie about my life,

00:53.692 --> 00:55.775
I'd have laughed.

00:55.817 --> 00:57.858
Thank god I did.

00:57.900 --> 01:00.150
I'd been off into the world.

01:00.191 --> 01:02.775
I have become more
open to myself.

01:21.441 --> 01:22.733
Yeah, right there
in the middle.

01:22.775 --> 01:23.608
Okay.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.650
Have I transformed?

01:27.692 --> 01:28.858
Not really.

01:28.900 --> 01:32.108
I carry too much
of my past with me.

01:32.149 --> 01:34.608
Am I free to be who I am?

01:34.650 --> 01:35.858
Yes.

01:35.900 --> 01:37.566
And with that,

01:37.608 --> 01:42.149
perhaps transformation isn't
the central issue after all.

Are you
liking it there?

02:14.983 --> 02:17.858
Yes, it's beautiful here.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.566
It's really beautiful.

02:19.608 --> 02:21.441
I think this is a good move.

02:21.483 --> 02:22.816
If you need anything,

02:24.775 --> 02:26.441
let me know.

02:26.483 --> 02:29.775
Well, I really don't even
think about that, you know.

02:29.817 --> 02:33.232
Between my age
and my background.

02:33.274 --> 02:36.691
I'll be living alone
the rest of my life,

02:36.733 --> 02:38.692
and that's okay, you know.

02:41.357 --> 02:42.900
That's, this is nice.

02:45.525 --> 02:47.274
I can learn to be me.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.358
Excuse me.

03:14.316 --> 03:14.942
Hi there.

03:16.733 --> 03:18.400
- Oh hi.
- My name is Zoey,

03:18.442 --> 03:19.983
and I live right down here.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.566
I wonder if I could
ask you for a favor.

03:22.608 --> 03:23.567
Uh, okay.

03:25.483 --> 03:26.691
What kind of favor?

03:26.733 --> 03:28.525
Well, I have this problem.

03:28.567 --> 03:31.483
I can't reach the top shelf
of my kitchen cabinets.

03:31.525 --> 03:34.358
And for some reason,
best known to himself,

03:34.400 --> 03:35.733
when my son comes over,

03:35.775 --> 03:37.691
he puts everything up there,

03:37.733 --> 03:39.316
and he doesn't seem to realize

03:39.358 --> 03:41.525
that they're empty for a reason.

03:41.567 --> 03:42.816
He's got a tall wife,

03:42.858 --> 03:45.733
and he seems to forget
that he has a short mom.

03:45.775 --> 03:48.650
So I was wondering if you
could reach some stuff for me.

03:48.692 --> 03:49.317
Please.

03:50.608 --> 03:52.900
Okay, I'm Kate, by the way.

03:52.942 --> 03:54.858
It's nice to meet you.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.900
And this is my partner Max.

03:56.942 --> 03:59.065
- My best friend.
- Hi Max.

03:59.107 --> 04:01.065
Okay let's go down here.

04:01.107 --> 04:01.942
Okay.

04:03.817 --> 04:04.608
I gotta tell you,

04:04.650 --> 04:07.441
I really admire
that you're tall.

04:07.483 --> 04:09.941
As a matter of fact,
I envy your height.

04:09.982 --> 04:12.566
It's very challenging
to be this short.

04:12.608 --> 04:14.900
Oh, I would think so.

04:14.942 --> 04:16.566
Absolutely.

04:16.608 --> 04:18.900
But I don't think I'm
gonna grow at this point.

04:18.942 --> 04:20.982
- I think.
- Oh probably not.

04:21.024 --> 04:22.858
This is a great place to live.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.816
I think you're
gonna like it here.

04:24.858 --> 04:27.358
Everybody cares
about everyone else.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.400
It's like we're living
among old people,

04:29.442 --> 04:31.900
but we don't realize we're old.

04:31.942 --> 04:34.567
Who are all these old people?

04:36.858 --> 04:37.775
It's right over there.

04:37.817 --> 04:40.066
This cabinet on the top shelf.

04:42.066 --> 04:45.775
So didn't I see you at
First Unitarian last week?

04:45.817 --> 04:47.650
No, I just moved in.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.650
Oh, where'd you come from?

04:50.692 --> 04:52.107
Laramie, Wyoming.

04:52.149 --> 04:53.608
Wow, Wyoming.

04:54.941 --> 04:56.858
Does everyone dress
like that in Wyoming?

04:56.900 --> 04:58.858
No, most people wear jeans.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.608
Well, that's pretty
unique, I'll say that.

05:01.650 --> 05:03.900
- Okay.
- Thanks a lot, you know?

05:03.941 --> 05:05.065
I keep meaning to get a stool,

05:05.107 --> 05:06.691
and I keep forgetting.

05:06.733 --> 05:08.316
But now with neighbors like you,

05:08.358 --> 05:10.400
who needs a stool, right?

05:10.442 --> 05:12.900
Right, well, I'm glad to help.

05:12.941 --> 05:14.358
Well how about sticking around

05:14.400 --> 05:15.733
and having a cup of tea?

05:15.775 --> 05:18.024
- I have, I have...
- Oh come on, come on come on.

05:18.066 --> 05:19.483
Just say yes.

05:19.525 --> 05:21.733
It's just a cup of
tea, no commitment.

05:21.775 --> 05:23.566
Okay, yeah, sure.

05:23.608 --> 05:25.400
Okay, let me get some.

05:25.442 --> 05:27.483
How about some cheese
and crackers with that?

05:27.525 --> 05:28.692
Oh, alright.

05:32.692 --> 05:33.940
Mm, now that I think of it,

05:33.982 --> 05:36.525
how about some wine instead?

05:37.650 --> 05:38.733
Sure, why not?

05:38.775 --> 05:41.150
You know, one of the good
things about getting old

05:41.192 --> 05:44.358
is that we can drink
whenever we want.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.150
We don't have to ask
anyone's permissions.

05:46.192 --> 05:47.775
Oh that's plenty.

05:47.817 --> 05:48.858
Thank you.

05:50.608 --> 05:52.400
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.816
So did you come
here alone, Kate?

05:58.858 --> 05:59.940
I did.

05:59.982 --> 06:02.858
My partner died four years ago.

06:02.899 --> 06:04.816
I'm really sorry to hear that.

06:04.858 --> 06:06.899
Well yeah, thanks.

06:08.066 --> 06:09.608
But you know,

06:09.650 --> 06:13.483
just in case you
might be interested,

06:13.525 --> 06:15.024
I know a lot of single people.

06:15.066 --> 06:17.857
Oh, I don't need that.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.899
Thank you very much.

06:19.941 --> 06:21.733
Well, amen to that.

06:21.775 --> 06:23.191
Have some more wine, Kate.

06:23.233 --> 06:25.191
It's good for you.

06:27.899 --> 06:28.899
Cheers.

06:28.941 --> 06:32.065
Cheers.

07:07.275 --> 07:09.483
This was the 1950s,

07:09.525 --> 07:12.899
a time when people didn't
talk about their bodies.

12:01.942 --> 12:03.275
They're back from their trip.

12:03.317 --> 12:04.233
Oh, where'd they go this time?

I forget.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.732
Montana, doesn't matter.

12:06.774 --> 12:09.150
I have to tell you something.

12:09.192 --> 12:12.900
Well, before they
went on their trip,

12:12.942 --> 12:14.400
John and I got together,

12:14.442 --> 12:16.192
and we went hiking.

12:18.275 --> 12:20.066
It was wonderful.

12:20.108 --> 12:22.275
We had this fabulous trip,

12:23.607 --> 12:26.774
and we stopped at
this perfect spot.

12:28.400 --> 12:32.233
And well, it proceeded
and let me tell you,

12:32.275 --> 12:34.275
John has a lot of stamina.

12:36.108 --> 12:38.233
There we were, you know.

12:38.275 --> 12:40.316
Really going at it.

12:40.358 --> 12:41.565
Good grief, woman.

12:41.607 --> 12:43.066
Don't you know
you're not supposed

12:43.108 --> 12:45.275
to put your paws on some
other woman's husband?

12:45.317 --> 12:47.233
No, he's not married.

12:47.275 --> 12:49.400
Well, then have at it.

12:49.442 --> 12:51.900
You will, anyway.

12:51.942 --> 12:53.816
Oh, Andrea.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.316
Hi.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.316
- That was gorgeous.
- Oh thank you.

12:57.358 --> 12:58.358
- Just gorgeous.
- Thank you,

12:58.400 --> 12:59.858
thanks very much.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.358
We have some new people.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.275
Yeah, I thought I saw
some new faces over here.

13:03.317 --> 13:04.440
Do you know Zoey?

13:04.482 --> 13:06.025
No, no, hi Zoey.

13:06.067 --> 13:07.108
Hi, nice to meet you.

13:07.150 --> 13:08.025
Nice to meet you, too.

13:08.067 --> 13:09.482
And this is Kate.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.565
Hi Kate.

13:11.607 --> 13:12.440
Hi Andrea.

13:12.482 --> 13:13.275
Nice to meet you.

13:13.317 --> 13:15.191
Oh, my pleasure.

13:15.233 --> 13:16.440
- Please stay, have a seat.
- Come on, have a seat.

13:16.482 --> 13:18.191
- Join us.
- Oh we want to see you.

13:18.233 --> 13:19.983
- Alright.
- Have a seat, have a seat.

13:20.025 --> 13:21.025
Meet Kate.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.565
Your public wants you.

13:24.607 --> 13:25.900
Really nice evening, huh?

13:25.942 --> 13:27.108
Yeah, yeah,

13:27.150 --> 13:29.400
it's been a really
great evening.

13:34.358 --> 13:36.649
So, I
haven't seen you

13:36.691 --> 13:39.316
at one of our concerts before.

13:39.358 --> 13:42.358
Oh yeah, I just
moved to Portland.

13:43.607 --> 13:45.358
You were great, by the way.

13:45.399 --> 13:46.482
Oh, thanks.

13:48.025 --> 13:49.482
Maybe you'd like to
join us sometime.

13:49.524 --> 13:53.275
Oh no, I ruined
my voice years ago.

13:53.317 --> 13:54.941
You don't want to hear me sing.

13:54.983 --> 13:58.275
Oh well, if you
ever change your mind,

13:59.275 --> 14:00.524
come on over.

14:00.566 --> 14:01.942
Okay.

14:02.566 --> 14:05.150
So, I noticed you.

14:05.192 --> 14:08.358
I've been admiring your
earrings and your necklace.

14:08.399 --> 14:09.275
It's very pretty.

14:09.317 --> 14:10.941
Thank you.

14:10.983 --> 14:14.066
I was afraid maybe I'd dressed
too loud for the occasion.

14:14.108 --> 14:14.942
No, no.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.067
Anything goes around here.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.233
So, no problem.

14:21.358 --> 14:23.900
Have you
lived in Portland long?

14:23.942 --> 14:25.399
Yeah, I have.

14:25.441 --> 14:28.191
How many years has it been now?

14:28.233 --> 14:29.357
42 years.

14:29.399 --> 14:30.399
Oh wow.

14:30.441 --> 14:31.357
Yeah.

14:31.399 --> 14:32.399
Almost a native.

14:37.275 --> 14:41.108
So what are those
guys talking about?

14:41.150 --> 14:43.025
I really don't know them.

14:43.067 --> 14:44.275
You don't know them?

14:48.692 --> 14:52.440
- My favorite subject.
- Yeah.

14:52.482 --> 14:53.983
They seem to
be enjoying themselves.

14:54.025 --> 14:56.440
They do seem to be
enjoying themselves.

14:56.482 --> 14:57.524
I am too.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.399
Oh yeah, me too.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.691
Feeling a little shy, though.

15:02.733 --> 15:05.108
Oh, yeah, me too.

15:10.441 --> 15:12.399
Is Lilly always that way?

15:12.441 --> 15:14.357
- Yeah.
- Oh.

15:16.357 --> 15:18.108
When we met the other day,

15:18.150 --> 15:21.691
I thought to myself, what
an interesting person.

15:21.733 --> 15:25.399
I'd really like to
get to know her.

15:25.441 --> 15:27.191
Oh.

15:27.233 --> 15:30.566
Well, I don't know
how interesting I am.

15:33.108 --> 15:37.233
So, Lilly told me
you'd been in the Coast Guard.

15:37.275 --> 15:38.357
I was.

15:38.399 --> 15:40.399
- 21 years.
- Wow.

15:40.441 --> 15:41.233
I was in the Army, too.

15:41.275 --> 15:44.440
But I liked the
Coast Guard, better.

15:44.482 --> 15:46.233
Must have been
interesting to be out there

15:46.275 --> 15:48.275
on a ship with all those guys.

15:48.316 --> 15:49.650
Ha, well.

15:50.733 --> 15:53.733
Most of my stations
were on shore.

15:53.775 --> 15:56.440
So what
brought you to Portland?

15:56.482 --> 15:58.440
Well, I wanted to be
closer to my daughter.

15:58.482 --> 16:00.316
She's up in Olympia.

16:01.482 --> 16:02.274
I wanted to be able to see her

16:02.316 --> 16:04.150
more than once a year.

16:05.441 --> 16:09.274
I think I also wanted
to be in a bigger place.

16:10.524 --> 16:12.274
So you're starting over.

16:12.316 --> 16:15.357
Yep, 68 years old.

16:15.399 --> 16:18.316
It took me a long
time to get here.

16:22.608 --> 16:24.691
Oh gosh, after my divorce,

16:24.733 --> 16:26.608
I moved to Portland.

16:27.482 --> 16:29.816
And I worked as a librarian,

16:29.858 --> 16:32.315
for 15, maybe 20 years.

16:32.357 --> 16:34.315
And then I started
my own business.

16:34.357 --> 16:35.524
And here I am.

16:37.108 --> 16:39.482
Well, it seems
funny that we can

16:39.524 --> 16:42.608
sum up our lives in
just a few sentences.

16:42.650 --> 16:44.025
Yeah.

16:44.067 --> 16:45.691
We all know that there's
more to it than that,

16:45.733 --> 16:48.150
- but, yeah.
- Yeah.

16:48.192 --> 16:50.566
We've lived long lives, Kate.

16:50.608 --> 16:51.441
Yep.

16:54.357 --> 16:56.399
This is a nice
place you got here.

16:56.441 --> 16:57.315
Well thanks.

16:57.357 --> 16:59.191
Do you have
it all to yourself?

16:59.232 --> 17:00.274
Yeah, I do.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.525
I don't have any roommates,

17:02.567 --> 17:04.483
and I don't have a boyfriend.

17:04.525 --> 17:07.357
Just some good girlfriends
and my business.

17:07.399 --> 17:12.066
Yeah, sometimes relationships
can get so complicated.

17:12.108 --> 17:13.315
You want to live life.

17:13.357 --> 17:15.691
I want to live life.

17:15.733 --> 17:18.399
Well, I hope you do.

17:20.733 --> 17:25.441
You're so cute.

17:25.483 --> 17:26.775
You're
pretty cute yourself.

17:26.817 --> 17:30.274
Oh thanks.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.399
Hello?

17:48.441 --> 17:51.190
Oh hi,
Kate, this is Andrea.

17:51.232 --> 17:52.691
Oh, Andrea.

17:52.733 --> 17:54.190
Good morning.

17:54.232 --> 17:55.691
Hi.

17:55.733 --> 17:58.525
I hope I didn't wake you up.

17:58.567 --> 17:59.775
Oh, no. I'm up.

18:01.942 --> 18:03.315
I was thinking about

18:03.357 --> 18:06.650
going shopping today
for some clothes,

18:06.692 --> 18:09.608
and I wondered if you'd
like to go with me.

18:09.650 --> 18:11.274
Oh, yeah, sure.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.691
Okay.

18:15.733 --> 18:16.650
I could get some things too.

18:16.692 --> 18:19.232
Well don't sound too excited.

18:19.274 --> 18:21.566
Oh no, I'd
like to go with you.

18:21.608 --> 18:23.775
It sounds like fun.

18:23.817 --> 18:25.566
Well you
get your breakfast,

18:25.608 --> 18:28.400
and I'll pick you up
a little after noon.

18:28.442 --> 18:29.733
Okay, okay, bye.

18:31.650 --> 18:32.858
Bye.

18:44.232 --> 18:45.650
How do you think that works?

18:45.692 --> 18:47.900
It's nice, I like it.

18:47.942 --> 18:48.775
Alright.

18:50.942 --> 18:52.650
I liked it, too.

18:58.316 --> 19:00.274
Well here's one I think

19:00.316 --> 19:01.733
really delivers your message.

19:05.357 --> 19:07.608
Wow, classy and feminine.

19:29.692 --> 19:33.692
Well, I always thought
clothes made the woman.

19:39.817 --> 19:42.274
Puberty can be tough.

19:42.316 --> 19:45.775
Getting the wrong puberty
can be even worse.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.608
And if you don't have people
around you who understand,

19:50.650 --> 19:52.483
it can be devastating.

20:00.442 --> 20:01.775
I made dinner.

20:02.692 --> 20:04.358
Looks nice.

20:12.274 --> 20:13.358
How is it?

20:13.400 --> 20:14.567
Really good.

20:15.733 --> 20:16.817
It's perfect.

20:19.692 --> 20:20.567
No, let me.

20:35.775 --> 20:36.775
Thank you.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.317
Are you okay?

21:30.817 --> 21:31.733
I'm fine.

21:37.149 --> 21:37.982
No.

21:38.817 --> 21:40.525
Something's wrong.

21:43.107 --> 21:44.358
Not really.

21:48.358 --> 21:48.982
Sorry.

21:53.941 --> 21:55.567
Give me some more.

22:24.525 --> 22:25.358
Al?

22:56.817 --> 22:57.608
Al.

23:00.567 --> 23:02.899
Your father's on his way home.

23:02.941 --> 23:05.899
So you two should
get cleaned up.

23:40.899 --> 23:43.024
Why didn't you tell me?

23:43.066 --> 23:44.442
You're moving?

23:46.857 --> 23:49.441
My dad told me you're moving.

23:49.483 --> 23:51.192
Why didn't you tell me?

23:52.150 --> 23:54.150
I didn't know, either.

23:55.525 --> 23:58.941
Not until my mother
told me like a week ago.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.692
But, my dad got
a job in Indiana.

24:07.108 --> 24:08.941
So we have to go, too.

24:11.024 --> 24:12.066
I'm sorry.

24:16.108 --> 24:20.483
I'm never gonna have a
friend like you again, am I?

24:35.899 --> 24:36.733
Listen.

24:40.733 --> 24:43.982
They're gonna tear
the house down.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.067
So...

24:49.067 --> 24:51.774
Let's go downstairs
one more time.

24:51.816 --> 24:54.650
Okay.

25:39.108 --> 25:40.732
Albert was leaving.

25:40.774 --> 25:44.025
His house was getting
torn down for the freeway.

25:44.067 --> 25:48.025
Our secret haven was
being taken away.

25:48.067 --> 25:49.732

27:01.150 --> 27:03.275
about playing in his basement.

27:08.317 --> 27:10.191
Over the winter of 1983,

27:10.233 --> 27:12.941
I was an engineer
in the Coast Guard.

27:12.983 --> 27:14.233
I was divorced,

27:14.275 --> 27:16.150
and my daughter Casey was nine,

27:16.192 --> 27:17.815
living with her mother.

27:17.857 --> 27:19.400
I was alone and lonely,

27:19.442 --> 27:20.774
and I had begun to dress

27:20.816 --> 27:22.441
in women's clothes in private

When I met Linda,

29:49.358 --> 29:51.233
I saw that she liked her wine,

29:51.275 --> 29:53.275
but didn't think much about it.

29:53.317 --> 29:57.191
Her father and older
brother were alcoholics.

29:57.233 --> 30:00.191
And Linda was okay
with my cross-dressing.

30:00.233 --> 30:01.358
At least at first.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.316
How are the potatoes?

30:03.358 --> 30:05.150
- They're good.
- Yeah?

30:05.192 --> 30:06.400
Just right.

30:06.441 --> 30:08.275
I made 'em the
way you like 'em.

30:08.317 --> 30:11.191
She was jealous
of the other woman.

30:11.233 --> 30:13.941
Even though that was me.

30:13.983 --> 30:16.482
Oh, you're probably
really tired, huh?

30:16.524 --> 30:18.233
I don't really get that.

30:18.275 --> 30:21.316
When people are tired
after traveling.

30:21.358 --> 30:23.607
All I did was sit on a train.

30:27.317 --> 30:31.316
Well, you must be looking
forward to Christmas.

30:31.358 --> 30:32.275
Excited about it?

30:32.317 --> 30:33.399
Not really.

30:33.441 --> 30:36.440
I can't fit my presents
in my suitcase.

30:36.482 --> 30:38.607
So I can't take them home.

30:40.275 --> 30:42.565
Well, maybe that's okay.

30:42.607 --> 30:45.150
Maybe they'll just
be here for you

30:45.192 --> 30:47.650
when you come to visit.

30:47.692 --> 30:49.316
What do you mean?

30:49.358 --> 30:50.983
Well, we were thinking that

30:51.025 --> 30:52.150
if you had your own room

30:52.192 --> 30:53.482
and some of your own things,

30:53.524 --> 30:57.233
that maybe you'd feel more
comfortable to come visit,

30:57.275 --> 30:59.358
maybe a little more often.

30:59.399 --> 31:00.358
Oh.

31:02.275 --> 31:03.607
You know, your father
wanted to get you something

31:03.649 --> 31:05.399
really special,

31:05.441 --> 31:08.316
and we thought you'd like it.

31:08.357 --> 31:09.524
You know, when I was little,

31:09.566 --> 31:13.482
I was lucky to get a good job
from my parents once a year,

31:13.524 --> 31:15.524
much less a new bicycle.

31:17.399 --> 31:19.317
You should be grateful.

31:23.399 --> 31:24.399
Casey.

31:26.233 --> 31:28.066
Oh, just let her
cool down, Dan.

31:28.108 --> 31:31.942
She's just tired.

31:33.607 --> 31:36.233
What are you doing?

31:36.275 --> 31:38.357
You said yourself that
divorce is hard on children.

31:38.399 --> 31:42.900
But she doesn't need
to punish you for it.

31:42.942 --> 31:46.357
You just, you let
me handle this, okay?

31:50.357 --> 31:54.524
♪ Merry merry merry Christmas ♪

31:55.441 --> 31:57.608
Casey, this is
hard on both of us.

31:57.650 --> 32:00.608
Can we just try to
not make it worse?

32:01.983 --> 32:03.566
I came
here to see you,

32:03.608 --> 32:05.942
not your wino girlfriend!

32:38.775 --> 32:40.399
Fly like an eagle.

32:40.441 --> 32:42.108
Just

32:42.150 --> 32:44.566
What are you watching?

32:44.608 --> 32:47.357
Oh it's just
this old cop show.

32:49.482 --> 32:50.482
I like these.

32:52.150 --> 32:53.150
Justice,
loyal, and German soldiers.

32:53.192 --> 32:54.399
Any prisoner here is-

32:54.441 --> 32:56.066
- You want to watch
something else?

32:56.108 --> 32:57.441
No, this is fine.

33:06.482 --> 33:07.608
Why'd you leave?

33:15.274 --> 33:16.108
Well,

33:18.692 --> 33:19.524
sweetie.

33:22.482 --> 33:23.650
Your mother and I,

33:23.692 --> 33:26.483
we decided that we would,

33:26.525 --> 33:29.232
well, it'd be better for you,

33:29.274 --> 33:31.191
and it'd be better for her,

33:31.232 --> 33:32.566
if you stayed.

33:32.608 --> 33:36.192
Well you know, your
school, your friends.

33:40.192 --> 33:42.441
But why did you leave me?

33:45.150 --> 33:45.775
Sweetie,

33:48.733 --> 33:51.357
I wish it had been different.

33:56.191 --> 33:57.650
I don't know, hon.

33:59.525 --> 34:01.150
It's just, I'm sorry.

34:02.733 --> 34:04.483
I am Major Hoffman.

34:04.525 --> 34:06.357
Of the funeral staff.

34:06.399 --> 34:07.608
Oh you are?

34:07.650 --> 34:10.525
And why didn't you bring
your funeral with you?

34:14.232 --> 34:15.525
Were my
relationships difficult

34:15.567 --> 34:18.190
because I didn't know who I was?

34:18.232 --> 34:20.067
Couldn't be who I was.

34:21.232 --> 34:24.190
Or did I just not know
how to love another?

34:24.232 --> 34:27.399
When I didn't know
how to love myself.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.232
It was fun spending
time with your friends.

34:32.274 --> 34:33.566
Thanks for including me.

34:33.608 --> 34:34.691
Oh, you're welcome.

34:34.733 --> 34:36.357
I'm glad you could come over.

34:36.399 --> 34:37.274
They're fun.

34:37.316 --> 34:38.733
Yeah, they are.

34:42.692 --> 34:44.608
So this is on me.

34:44.650 --> 34:45.691
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:45.733 --> 34:47.232
You don't have to do that.

34:47.274 --> 34:48.525
I want to.

34:48.567 --> 34:51.232
Okay, well I'll
get the next time.

34:51.274 --> 34:51.942
Okay.

34:54.274 --> 34:57.274
So what sounds good to you?

34:57.316 --> 35:01.108
If I get the dead guy
wings, will you share with me?

35:01.149 --> 35:02.650
No.

35:02.692 --> 35:04.733
No, that's entirely too messy.

35:04.775 --> 35:06.400
Oh, yeah.

35:06.442 --> 35:07.566
You could get 'em.

35:07.608 --> 35:10.232
Yeah, but you're
probably right.

35:10.274 --> 35:11.692
Maybe I'll get the,

35:12.983 --> 35:14.775
well, I don't know.

35:19.399 --> 35:20.441
Casey's coming soon.

35:20.483 --> 35:23.650
I'd love for you to meet her.

35:23.692 --> 35:26.608
I would very much
like to meet her, too.

35:26.650 --> 35:28.149
She sounds like
a wonderful girl.

35:28.191 --> 35:29.608
Oh, I think so.

35:29.650 --> 35:31.733
I'm very lucky.

35:31.775 --> 35:34.900
Are you still in
touch with Casey's...

35:40.692 --> 35:41.525
I...

35:45.191 --> 35:46.483
Not very often.

35:47.733 --> 35:51.232
They were with me
through the tough times.

35:54.817 --> 35:56.191
We're friends.

35:57.442 --> 35:58.608
That's nice.

36:02.525 --> 36:05.650
So, since we're telling
each other stories

36:05.692 --> 36:08.775
about our past relationships,

36:08.817 --> 36:11.858
I'll tell you about
my first marriage.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.274
It was really quite awful.

36:18.733 --> 36:19.650
A couple years into it,

36:19.692 --> 36:21.358
I met another teacher,

36:21.400 --> 36:22.942
and we had an affair.

36:24.650 --> 36:25.941
Turned out to be seven
of the nine years

36:25.983 --> 36:27.775
that I was married.

36:29.650 --> 36:30.691
When I was 29,

36:30.733 --> 36:33.650
I realized that I couldn't
stay married to two guys

36:33.692 --> 36:35.692
for the rest of my life.

36:36.942 --> 36:41.650
And so, I divorced 'em
both and moved to Oregon.

36:41.692 --> 36:43.442
Oh, good for you.

36:44.942 --> 36:47.316
Well, that was a long time ago.

36:47.358 --> 36:48.608
Yeah, it was.

36:50.817 --> 36:53.816
You know, I think we make

36:53.858 --> 36:56.358
the best decisions that
we can at the time.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.691
Yeah.

36:57.733 --> 37:00.858
And they end up
being our stories.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.691
And without them,

37:03.733 --> 37:06.483
we wouldn't be where we are now.

37:06.525 --> 37:07.692
That's true.

37:08.858 --> 37:11.733
I like where we are today.

37:12.942 --> 37:14.567
Yeah, I do too.

37:16.567 --> 37:19.400
I'll just get my keys.

37:19.442 --> 37:20.900
After we'd
lived in Laramie

37:20.942 --> 37:22.775
for a couple of years,

37:22.817 --> 37:24.733
Linda got sick.

37:24.775 --> 37:26.858
Now, I'll be right back.

37:26.900 --> 37:30.900
The diagnosis
was that it was terminal.

37:31.858 --> 37:34.441
Unless she could stop drinking.

37:34.483 --> 37:37.024
After several
tries, she gave up,

37:37.066 --> 37:38.817
resigned to her fate.

37:51.775 --> 37:52.608
Oh...

38:01.817 --> 38:02.650
Where is it, where is it,

38:02.692 --> 38:04.024
where is it, where
is it, where is it?

38:04.066 --> 38:08.608
God damn it!

38:09.858 --> 38:12.900
No no, no no, no no
no no no no no, no no.

38:16.567 --> 38:18.024
Where is the opener?

38:18.982 --> 38:20.400
I threw it away.

38:20.442 --> 38:21.775
Well then I'll just
push the cork down.

38:21.817 --> 38:22.816
I've done it plenty!

38:22.858 --> 38:24.858
That's pathetic!

38:24.900 --> 38:26.608
You're pathetic!

38:28.483 --> 38:31.733
What would Casey think
if she knew about you?

38:31.775 --> 38:34.940
If she knew you liked
to wear women's clothes!

38:34.982 --> 38:36.566
- You're killing yourself!
- I bet she'd love

38:36.608 --> 38:37.775
to know that!

38:37.817 --> 38:40.858
Linda, you are
killing yourself.

38:42.107 --> 38:42.941
You are.

39:45.192 --> 39:46.940
As she became sicker,

39:46.982 --> 39:50.525
I had to spend more and more
time taking care of her.

39:50.567 --> 39:51.899
She resented that.

40:08.982 --> 40:09.899
Is it too hot?

40:09.941 --> 40:11.024
Well it's, a little bit.

40:11.066 --> 40:12.982
- It'll be okay.
- Okay.

41:03.233 --> 41:04.233
Thank you.

41:15.692 --> 41:18.650
After
Linda died in '07,

41:18.692 --> 41:21.774
I worked to put my
life back together.

41:21.816 --> 41:23.940
She and I had been
good together,

41:23.982 --> 41:28.857
but her decline had stretched
me all too close to breaking.

41:28.899 --> 41:30.316
I blamed her and her drinking

41:30.358 --> 41:33.608
for the misery of
the last few years.

41:33.650 --> 41:38.024
And I blamed myself for my
inadequacies in helping her.

41:57.692 --> 41:59.899
Your succulents are fake.

42:08.150 --> 42:10.150
I'm sorry for your loss.

42:14.150 --> 42:17.316
I don't know what to
say at these things.

42:17.358 --> 42:19.150
It's okay, Bruce.

42:22.650 --> 42:24.108
She was too young.

42:26.233 --> 42:28.899
But, you're gonna feel better.

42:31.941 --> 42:33.691
You're gonna be okay.

42:36.025 --> 42:38.191
Thank you, it's nice
of you to say that.

42:38.233 --> 42:40.067
I needed to hear it.

42:44.067 --> 42:47.108
Oh, and thank you for
all of your help today.

42:47.150 --> 42:49.650
And if you need
anything else, you know,

42:49.691 --> 42:51.067
I'll do whatever.

42:52.067 --> 42:53.816
Right, thank you.

42:55.941 --> 42:57.400
Thanks for coming.

42:57.442 --> 42:58.608
Of course.

43:00.983 --> 43:01.816
Okay.

43:08.899 --> 43:10.191
Let us know if you
need anything, okay?

43:10.233 --> 43:11.066
I will, thank you for coming.

43:11.108 --> 43:12.108
No problem.

43:12.150 --> 43:12.941
See you in church, okay?

43:12.983 --> 43:14.108
Okay, alright.

43:27.025 --> 43:28.108
Doing okay?

43:29.108 --> 43:30.108
Yeah.

43:35.317 --> 43:38.857
Did you at least
get something to eat?

43:40.150 --> 43:42.108
I'm just glad it's over.

43:47.983 --> 43:49.066
Well, it was a
beautiful service.

43:49.108 --> 43:51.233
You did a great job.

43:51.275 --> 43:52.067
Thank you.

43:54.816 --> 43:58.066
I'm glad you could
come up for this.

43:58.108 --> 43:59.774
Me too.

43:59.816 --> 44:01.233
I wanted to be here.

44:04.317 --> 44:06.150
Is that your old bike?

44:08.983 --> 44:09.816
Yeah.

44:10.732 --> 44:12.191
Yeah.

44:12.233 --> 44:13.067
The...

44:14.983 --> 44:17.691
Brings back
memories, doesn't it?

44:19.358 --> 44:21.857
Linda and I rode everywhere.

44:23.192 --> 44:25.275
That's how we found Laramie.

44:25.317 --> 44:26.150
We went out to the
Rocky Mountains,

44:26.192 --> 44:29.858
and just started
thinking of moving West.

44:32.275 --> 44:33.317
Dad.

44:36.317 --> 44:40.192
I'm sorry that Linda and
I were never that close.

44:44.108 --> 44:46.316
Look, I know that was
a difficult relationship

44:46.358 --> 44:47.691
for you both.

44:49.067 --> 44:51.316
I wanted to like her.

44:51.358 --> 44:53.441
I did, I just...

44:53.483 --> 44:55.317
It was a tough time.

44:58.566 --> 44:59.900
There is this.

45:00.774 --> 45:02.025
Well, I hate to even say this,

45:02.067 --> 45:03.358
but there's a small part of me

45:03.400 --> 45:05.233
that's relived that...

45:07.900 --> 45:10.025
I feel guilty for
even thinking that.

45:10.067 --> 45:11.317
I mean, that's...

45:12.358 --> 45:13.358
That's bad, isn't it?

45:13.400 --> 45:14.233
No.

45:16.233 --> 45:18.358
You loved her so much.

45:18.400 --> 45:21.858
You took care of
her for so long.

45:21.900 --> 45:24.400
Now it's time to live your life.

45:26.524 --> 45:28.983
Can I tell you something?

45:30.233 --> 45:32.858
I need to tell you something.

45:32.900 --> 45:34.192
Yeah, of course.

45:35.566 --> 45:40.025
I wish I had mentioned
it a long time ago.

45:40.067 --> 45:40.900
Okay.

45:47.358 --> 45:51.233
I find comfort in
wearing women's clothes.

46:09.233 --> 46:11.900
Some of this still
doesn't make sense to me,

46:11.942 --> 46:14.275
but I've grown to accept it.

46:15.275 --> 46:18.150
Some things just
don't make sense.

46:19.025 --> 46:19.858
Here.

46:35.150 --> 46:36.441
What do you think?

46:42.358 --> 46:43.400
Well,

46:45.441 --> 46:47.524
it's age appropriate.

46:53.317 --> 46:54.817
I suppose it is.

47:22.482 --> 47:23.317
I'm sorry.

47:24.192 --> 47:25.358
No, it's okay.

47:26.566 --> 47:28.358
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

47:30.358 --> 47:31.399
Are you okay?

47:31.441 --> 47:33.108
I'm okay, I'm okay.

47:33.150 --> 47:34.565
- Okay.
- Are you okay?

47:34.607 --> 47:36.317
Yeah, I will be.

47:37.399 --> 47:39.025
- Okay.
- Alright.

47:41.275 --> 47:44.399
Come on, let's forget this.

47:44.441 --> 47:46.607
Okay, show me that bike.

48:05.233 --> 48:06.608
Hey Kate.

48:06.650 --> 48:07.942
Are you okay?

48:09.275 --> 48:10.399
Oh yeah.

48:10.441 --> 48:11.399
I'm fine.

48:11.441 --> 48:15.275
I just, I'm a little in
my head this afternoon.

48:17.441 --> 48:21.150
Would you like me to let
you go home to take a nap?

48:21.192 --> 48:22.025
Oh, no.

48:24.233 --> 48:27.733
No, no, I'm having
a wonderful time.

48:27.775 --> 48:28.607
So am I.

48:29.733 --> 48:30.566
So am I.

48:35.482 --> 48:38.233
This is really, really pretty.

48:38.275 --> 48:40.233
It is a pretty place.

48:55.983 --> 48:57.440
Beautiful picture.

48:57.482 --> 48:59.108
Looks like Wyoming.

48:59.150 --> 49:00.357
It is.

49:00.399 --> 49:02.150
I love that painting.

49:15.150 --> 49:17.108
Great, appreciate it.

49:20.482 --> 49:21.733
It's nice to be here.

49:21.775 --> 49:24.399
Well, I'm glad you're here.

49:34.608 --> 49:36.066
This must be Casey.

49:36.108 --> 49:37.482
Yeah, that's her.

49:38.524 --> 49:39.567
Yeah...

49:40.482 --> 49:43.608
I loved her the
moment she appeared.

49:45.482 --> 49:49.650
And I wasn't always there
when she was crying out.

49:53.650 --> 49:56.692
I had a little growing
up to do myself.

49:58.274 --> 50:00.315
Want to see my flutes?

50:04.650 --> 50:05.482
Yeah.

50:10.608 --> 50:12.192
That's beautiful.

50:46.525 --> 50:48.150
So that's what I was saying.

50:48.191 --> 50:51.525
What makes it unusual
is that it's white oak,

50:51.567 --> 50:53.608
almost all the floors
you see are red oak,

50:53.650 --> 50:56.566
and those are white, white oak.

50:59.692 --> 51:00.357
God, did I tell you about

51:00.399 --> 51:02.608
trying to permit my greenhouse?

51:02.650 --> 51:03.816
And you know what,
that's invasive.

51:03.858 --> 51:06.232
You should tear that out.

51:06.274 --> 51:07.399
I don't know plants.

51:07.441 --> 51:08.816
Well, it shouldn't be there.

51:08.858 --> 51:10.399
It looks nice what
you did with it,

51:10.441 --> 51:11.399
but it should go.

51:11.441 --> 51:14.190
So between the setbacks
from the property line,

51:14.232 --> 51:16.483
and the minimum distance
between buildings,

51:16.525 --> 51:19.441
I don't have a greenhouse
big enough to do anything,

51:19.483 --> 51:21.232
and let alone, do
all my research.

51:21.274 --> 51:22.608
But you know,

51:22.650 --> 51:23.733
well what the heck?

51:23.775 --> 51:25.650
Who are they to say?

51:25.692 --> 51:26.566
And the thing is,

51:26.608 --> 51:28.190
you don't even need a permit

51:28.232 --> 51:29.691
for an agricultural
building out in the county.

51:29.733 --> 51:32.441
But in the city, you can't
get an agricultural permit.

51:32.483 --> 51:34.441
- Hey Bruce, Bruce.
- What?

51:34.483 --> 51:35.733
Bruce, can I,

51:36.692 --> 51:39.900
look, can I talk to
you for a second?

51:39.942 --> 51:40.775
Yeah.

51:42.608 --> 51:46.608
I'd like to tell you
something about myself.

51:47.733 --> 51:48.733
Okay.

51:52.692 --> 51:54.357
I'm transgender.

51:56.900 --> 51:59.232
What does that mean?

51:59.274 --> 51:59.817
Well,

52:01.442 --> 52:03.441
when I was little,

52:03.483 --> 52:05.316
I wanted to be a girl.

52:06.608 --> 52:08.608
But I didn't know how it worked.

52:08.650 --> 52:12.316
I just thought my body
would heal itself.

52:13.608 --> 52:14.442
Shut up.

52:17.733 --> 52:21.900
I've dressed in women's
clothes most of my life.

52:24.733 --> 52:27.900
I don't know how far
I'll pursue this,

52:29.525 --> 52:33.357
but it's time for me to
be more open about it.

53:10.733 --> 53:12.983
How much time do you
think you have left?

53:13.025 --> 53:14.483
Maybe 30 years?

53:16.525 --> 53:18.441
- Well...
- 20?

53:18.483 --> 53:20.358
Yeah, yeah I hope so.

53:21.817 --> 53:24.900
That's a long time
to not be happy.

53:30.358 --> 53:31.733
- Yeah.
- Right?

53:31.775 --> 53:33.274
I suppose it is.

53:35.817 --> 53:38.858
You're gonna
stay though, right?

53:39.775 --> 53:42.275
You're not gonna
move off somewhere.

53:42.317 --> 53:46.733
Yeah, I need my home, and
my friends, my community.

53:49.066 --> 53:50.816
Okay, okay.

53:50.858 --> 53:53.525
Those will be
imperative for me

53:53.567 --> 53:56.358
to feel like I can move forward.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.858
'Cause I got your back here.

54:01.942 --> 54:03.733
If you go off to...

54:05.775 --> 54:07.775
- Right.
- San Francisco.

54:09.942 --> 54:11.775
I don't know.

54:11.817 --> 54:12.900
Thanks Bruce.

54:16.942 --> 54:17.941
You know, when
you pull that out,

54:17.982 --> 54:20.400
you gotta get the roots, too.

54:20.442 --> 54:22.525
You gotta take it
all the way down,

54:22.567 --> 54:23.566
and you gotta watch it,

54:23.608 --> 54:24.858
and if it comes back,

54:24.900 --> 54:27.358
you gotta pull every bit of it.

54:27.400 --> 54:29.941
Maybe you ought to burn it.

54:29.982 --> 54:31.733
- Okay.
- I'll do it.

54:31.775 --> 54:33.858
- Okay.
- I'll do it tonight.

54:33.900 --> 54:35.858
Do it, I'll go make
more cookies right now.

54:38.900 --> 54:39.733
Alright.

54:42.692 --> 54:43.608
It seems like everyone

54:43.650 --> 54:47.441
has always wanted me
to be something else.

54:47.483 --> 54:49.733
Even I have wanted it.

54:49.775 --> 54:53.066
But Andrea seems to
want me to just be me.

54:56.483 --> 54:57.525
There's a bench over here.

54:57.567 --> 54:58.775
Do you mind if we sit down?

54:58.817 --> 55:00.733
No, that'd be fine.

55:11.692 --> 55:13.483
Beautiful here.

55:13.525 --> 55:15.442
Oh, it sure is, Kate.

55:29.817 --> 55:30.858
So, Kate.

55:41.442 --> 55:45.442
I have the sense you were
born into a male body.

55:55.775 --> 55:57.525
Well, you're right.

56:02.400 --> 56:05.150
I thought of it as
being out of register.

56:05.192 --> 56:09.899
You know, like when the colors
of an image don't line up.

56:12.066 --> 56:14.899
Somehow, wearing women's clothes

56:17.192 --> 56:20.857
gave me a break from
pretending to be a man.

56:26.567 --> 56:28.733
The pressure kept building

56:29.733 --> 56:30.857
to do something.

56:46.857 --> 56:50.024
When I was finally
able to transition,

56:52.941 --> 56:53.941
it was just,

56:55.941 --> 56:56.941
amazing.

56:58.692 --> 57:00.108
It was so wonderful.

57:14.816 --> 57:16.650
I'm so proud of you.

57:21.483 --> 57:22.108
Bless you.

57:26.608 --> 57:28.442
You're just wonderful.

57:29.774 --> 57:30.608
Am I?

57:57.317 --> 58:01.941
Kate, you're such an
interesting and complex person.

58:03.108 --> 58:03.982
Am I?

58:04.024 --> 58:05.567
Yeah, you are.

58:08.275 --> 58:12.191
It's funny, I was always
so forgettable as this guy,

58:12.233 --> 58:15.150
but people seem to
remember me now.

58:17.192 --> 58:18.982
You're wonderful.

58:20.025 --> 58:22.857
Well, I don't know about that.

58:23.982 --> 58:28.025
Well, I
think you're wonderful.

58:28.067 --> 58:29.815
Thank you.

58:29.857 --> 58:34.025
There's something I've
wanted to tell you today.

58:36.233 --> 58:38.691
You remember a couple weeks ago,

58:38.732 --> 58:41.774
we got to sit next to
each other in church

58:41.816 --> 58:43.815
for the first time.

58:43.857 --> 58:46.774
♪ Sing in my heart ♪

58:48.025 --> 58:51.983
Well, we were
singing "Spirit of Life,"

58:52.025 --> 58:53.899
and at some point,

58:53.941 --> 58:58.233
your voice dropped into its
natural baritone register.

58:59.650 --> 59:04.108
♪ Lies in the sea ♪

59:04.150 --> 59:08.899
♪ Move in the hand ♪

59:08.941 --> 59:13.941
♪ Giving life the
shape of justice ♪

59:14.899 --> 59:19.899
♪ Truth hold me close ♪

59:20.650 --> 59:23.067
♪ Grace, set me free ♪

59:26.150 --> 59:30.025
I literally
felt my heart crack open.

59:30.067 --> 59:32.815
It was a physical sensation.

59:32.857 --> 59:36.067
And I looked at you
and I said to myself,

59:38.691 --> 59:42.608
"You have just fallen in
love with this woman."

59:45.732 --> 59:46.983
Really?

59:47.025 --> 59:50.608
Yeah, really.

59:53.649 --> 59:56.066
But you've always
been with men.

59:56.108 --> 59:56.942
I know.

59:58.983 --> 1:00:02.108
I know. I've been
married to two men.

1:00:04.067 --> 1:00:06.774
But now I find that
I have fallen in love

1:00:06.816 --> 1:00:08.942
with a transgender woman.

1:00:11.108 --> 1:00:13.191
I think I've scared you.

1:00:13.233 --> 1:00:15.025
Well, well, I, I,

1:00:16.233 --> 1:00:18.316
I didn't expect this, Andrea.

1:00:18.358 --> 1:00:20.108
Well, Kate, I didn't
expect it either,

1:00:20.150 --> 1:00:21.691
but here we are.

1:00:23.816 --> 1:00:26.815
Let's just see where this goes.

1:00:26.857 --> 1:00:28.108
Oh, okay, okay.

1:00:33.857 --> 1:00:36.400
You don't need
to say anything.

1:00:40.108 --> 1:00:41.358
Take care.

1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:42.275
I love you.

1:00:47.108 --> 1:00:48.108
Ah.

1:00:51.691 --> 1:00:53.816
See if my knees will work.

1:00:57.233 --> 1:00:59.316
It's easy
to love Andrea.

1:00:59.358 --> 1:01:03.150
She's just so smart
and kind and confident.

1:01:03.192 --> 1:01:07.150
It's harder to accept
that she loves me.

1:01:07.192 --> 1:01:09.025
But I need to be free.

1:01:10.317 --> 1:01:13.108
Do I dare to try
to love someone,

1:01:13.150 --> 1:01:15.900
to make space for
her to love me?

1:01:23.275 --> 1:01:26.233
Oh gosh, what's, what's up?

1:01:29.858 --> 1:01:30.691
Uh oh.

1:01:32.858 --> 1:01:33.691
Hello?

1:01:34.942 --> 1:01:37.316
Oh hi Zoey, it's Andrea.

1:01:37.358 --> 1:01:39.358
Andrea, hi, what's up?

1:01:40.358 --> 1:01:42.983
Well, it's about Kate.

1:01:43.025 --> 1:01:43.858
Kate?

1:01:45.025 --> 1:01:46.275
What happened to
Kate, what's wrong?

1:01:46.317 --> 1:01:48.400
She's fine, she's fine.

1:01:53.275 --> 1:01:57.150
It's just that I told her
tonight that I love her.

1:01:57.192 --> 1:02:00.025
So wow, do you love her?

1:02:00.067 --> 1:02:01.108
Yeah, I do.

1:02:03.524 --> 1:02:04.858
Well, that's cool.

1:02:04.900 --> 1:02:07.066
So what's the problem?

1:02:07.108 --> 1:02:10.316
Well, I'm not supposed to
fall in love with a woman.

1:02:10.358 --> 1:02:12.900
Oh baloney, come on.

1:02:12.942 --> 1:02:13.858
Man, woman.

1:02:14.942 --> 1:02:16.358
You know, it doesn't
really matter.

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:18.150
The big gift is love.

1:02:18.192 --> 1:02:20.732
You find love, you
gotta go for it.

1:02:23.358 --> 1:02:24.442
Oh my gosh.

1:02:27.108 --> 1:02:28.400
But what if I scared her?

1:02:28.442 --> 1:02:29.400
Really?

1:02:29.442 --> 1:02:31.275
Kate's been in the Army,

1:02:31.317 --> 1:02:32.441
she's been in the Coast Guard.

1:02:32.482 --> 1:02:34.565
I doubt that she
scares so easily.

1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:39.858
Well, she sure didn't
say anything back.

1:02:39.900 --> 1:02:42.400
I think she just didn't
know what to say.

1:02:42.442 --> 1:02:45.400
She didn't know what
to do with that.

1:02:45.442 --> 1:02:48.316
Well, you know
she's more reserved.

1:02:48.358 --> 1:02:52.025
But I think she's
got the hots for you.

1:02:52.067 --> 1:02:54.108
Do you think so?

1:02:54.150 --> 1:02:55.358
It's obvious.

1:02:55.400 --> 1:02:58.316
You'd have to be blind
not to notice it.

1:02:58.358 --> 1:02:59.150
Wow.

1:03:00.233 --> 1:03:05.066
Well, it's
sure taken my by surprise.

1:03:05.108 --> 1:03:06.316
Well, we gave you some space.

1:03:06.358 --> 1:03:08.440
The rest is up to you.

1:03:08.482 --> 1:03:10.565
I should let you go to sleep.

1:03:10.607 --> 1:03:13.317
I think, I think I'll be fine,

1:03:14.482 --> 1:03:16.275
and I think that I'll
get a good night's sleep,

1:03:16.317 --> 1:03:17.317
and I think,

1:03:18.942 --> 1:03:20.317
I think I love her.

1:03:21.649 --> 1:03:23.440
No worries.

1:03:23.482 --> 1:03:25.900
I got a really good
feeling about this,

1:03:25.942 --> 1:03:28.816
so just want you to know that.

1:03:28.858 --> 1:03:30.358
Goodnight, dear.

1:03:49.983 --> 1:03:52.441
Now what, Max? These people...

1:03:54.524 --> 1:03:56.358
Hello?

1:03:56.399 --> 1:03:58.399
Hey Zoey, it's Kate.

1:03:58.441 --> 1:04:00.858
Ah Kate, what's up?

1:04:00.900 --> 1:04:03.316
I didn't wake you up, did I?

1:04:03.358 --> 1:04:04.399
Wake me?

1:04:04.441 --> 1:04:05.316
Nah, I was just reading,

1:04:05.358 --> 1:04:07.607
like I always do in the
middle of the night.

1:04:07.649 --> 1:04:09.025
Oh, oh good.

1:04:10.441 --> 1:04:12.150
Well, it's Andrea.

1:04:13.150 --> 1:04:14.066
What about Andrea?

1:04:14.108 --> 1:04:15.900
Is something wrong?

1:04:15.942 --> 1:04:18.358
Oh, everything's fantastic.

1:04:19.358 --> 1:04:22.317
She told me she
loved me tonight.

1:04:23.524 --> 1:04:24.357
Oh wow.

1:04:26.025 --> 1:04:27.150
That's cool.

1:04:27.192 --> 1:04:28.440
So what'd you do?

1:04:28.482 --> 1:04:30.900
Well I didn't
know what to say.

1:04:30.942 --> 1:04:33.357
I was just, I was floored.

1:04:33.399 --> 1:04:34.399
I mean, it was,

1:04:35.983 --> 1:04:39.067
I didn't know that
was a possibility.

1:04:41.692 --> 1:04:43.316
Well, you know,

1:04:43.357 --> 1:04:46.440
I hope I didn't
screw anything up.

1:04:46.482 --> 1:04:49.191
Oh, I'm sure you
didn't screw up.

1:04:49.233 --> 1:04:50.524
Andrea's a smart cookie.

1:04:50.566 --> 1:04:52.357
She'll get it.

1:04:52.399 --> 1:04:53.399
Yeah, well I,

1:04:55.566 --> 1:04:56.941
I'm a woman now.

1:04:56.983 --> 1:04:59.357
I thought I'd fall
in love with a man,

1:04:59.399 --> 1:05:01.067
but here's Andrea.

1:05:01.942 --> 1:05:03.608
She's wonderful.

1:05:03.650 --> 1:05:06.357
You know, as you
always tell me,

1:05:06.399 --> 1:05:08.191
what's so great about men?

1:05:08.233 --> 1:05:09.315
Yeah.

1:05:09.357 --> 1:05:11.233
But, just so you know,

1:05:11.275 --> 1:05:12.650
I have a really good
feeling about this.

1:05:12.692 --> 1:05:14.399
I want you to know that.

1:05:14.441 --> 1:05:16.942
Oh, oh thank you. I hope so.

1:05:17.733 --> 1:05:20.066
So can I go back to sleep now?

1:05:20.108 --> 1:05:21.441
Oh, okay Zoey.

1:05:22.441 --> 1:05:23.482
Thanks.

1:05:24.441 --> 1:05:25.399
Relax.

1:05:25.441 --> 1:05:26.441
Bye.

1:05:28.733 --> 1:05:29.608
Geeze, Max.

1:05:30.482 --> 1:05:33.566
Really, these
people, they're nuts.

1:05:33.608 --> 1:05:35.566
Not like my dog.

1:05:35.608 --> 1:05:37.316
You're a wise boy.

1:06:08.608 --> 1:06:10.691
These are for you, mom.

1:06:10.733 --> 1:06:13.482
I know you don't
like flowers, dad.

1:06:13.524 --> 1:06:15.441
I didn't bring you any.

1:06:19.067 --> 1:06:20.983
The trees have grown a lot

1:06:21.025 --> 1:06:22.650
since I was here last.

1:06:25.692 --> 1:06:27.233
I didn't really want to come by.

1:06:27.274 --> 1:06:28.733
Not because, well...

1:06:32.482 --> 1:06:33.440
If you could see me,

1:06:33.482 --> 1:06:36.232
you would see things are

1:06:36.274 --> 1:06:37.650
a little different.

1:06:43.482 --> 1:06:45.108
When I was young,

1:06:46.482 --> 1:06:48.482
you told me I was a boy.

1:06:49.650 --> 1:06:52.650
Though I didn't doubt
that I was male,

1:06:52.692 --> 1:06:54.692
I could see that, but...

1:06:58.567 --> 1:07:00.608
Somehow I knew that
I should be a girl.

1:07:00.650 --> 1:07:03.482
That I would be
happier as a girl.

1:07:05.108 --> 1:07:08.525
That I would fit into the
world better as a girl.

1:07:12.067 --> 1:07:15.482
I didn't know how bodies
worked, of course.

1:07:18.567 --> 1:07:20.232
I remember when I was little,

1:07:20.274 --> 1:07:24.399
being always so hopeful each
night when I went to bed.

1:07:27.316 --> 1:07:29.108
Before falling
asleep, I would just,

1:07:29.150 --> 1:07:31.525
I would think, well,
perhaps tonight is the night

1:07:31.567 --> 1:07:34.650
when this extra
stuff just falls off.

1:07:38.567 --> 1:07:43.567
Like how a scab falls off when
the skin underneath heals.

1:07:44.733 --> 1:07:47.567
Well then everyone would
see that I'm a girl.

1:07:51.608 --> 1:07:54.691
But I want to tell
you both now that,

1:07:54.733 --> 1:07:57.274
I've finally figured it out.

1:07:58.567 --> 1:08:00.149
I'm just sorry that

1:08:01.316 --> 1:08:03.441
I wasn't able to
get it all together

1:08:03.483 --> 1:08:05.483
soon enough to show you.

1:08:07.608 --> 1:08:08.566
'Cause I think your
reaction would be,

1:08:08.608 --> 1:08:11.775
"Well, now it all makes sense."

1:08:19.733 --> 1:08:22.858
I just want you to know that

1:08:22.900 --> 1:08:26.608
your troubled and
troublesome third child,

1:08:27.567 --> 1:08:30.858
who could never really
quite find himself,

1:08:30.900 --> 1:08:31.733
well,

1:08:33.608 --> 1:08:35.858
she has turned out alright.

1:08:54.692 --> 1:08:56.733
So I was finally done.

1:08:56.775 --> 1:09:00.691
I didn't know if this
day would ever come.

1:09:00.733 --> 1:09:04.442
I was ready to move
on to my life as Kate.

1:11:24.941 --> 1:11:26.816
Sometimes it's easier if I act

1:11:26.858 --> 1:11:28.775
as if you'd never been.

1:11:30.483 --> 1:11:33.775
But I wouldn't have gotten
here without you, Danny.

1:11:33.817 --> 1:11:34.692
I love you.

1:11:40.817 --> 1:11:42.982
Are you feeling okay?

1:11:43.024 --> 1:11:44.400
Yeah.

1:11:44.442 --> 1:11:45.816
I feel pretty good, actually.

1:11:45.858 --> 1:11:48.940
- Yeah?
- All things considered.

1:11:48.982 --> 1:11:51.900
I even took a few
steps around the room,

1:11:51.941 --> 1:11:52.982
and that's...

1:11:54.817 --> 1:11:55.941
That's good.

1:11:57.525 --> 1:11:59.900
Well, Dr. Bauer said
that she did a great job,

1:11:59.941 --> 1:12:02.816
and that the surgery
was a success.

1:12:02.858 --> 1:12:04.400
Yeah.

1:12:04.442 --> 1:12:07.858
- Yeah, she told me that too.
- That's good.

1:12:09.858 --> 1:12:12.692
Casey, I know this
is hard on you.

1:12:15.817 --> 1:12:18.400
But I'll always be your father.

1:12:25.024 --> 1:12:25.858
You know,

1:12:28.817 --> 1:12:30.358
a few months ago,

1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:32.566
I went to visit my
friends down in the South,

1:12:32.608 --> 1:12:34.941
and it was just so wonderful

1:12:36.692 --> 1:12:39.567
to walk down the
street as a woman.

1:12:41.442 --> 1:12:42.899
No hiding, no shame.

1:12:48.066 --> 1:12:50.525
Sometimes a man would open,

1:12:50.567 --> 1:12:52.733
hold the door open for me.

1:12:54.941 --> 1:12:58.733
And it felt real nice
to be treated as a lady.

1:13:02.066 --> 1:13:04.857
People have been so kind to me.

1:13:06.066 --> 1:13:10.899
And I know, I know that not
everyone's journey is like mine.

1:13:14.107 --> 1:13:16.441
But it just seems like

1:13:16.483 --> 1:13:19.400
this secret that
I held so tightly,

1:13:21.692 --> 1:13:23.775
hid so well for 65 years,

1:13:27.483 --> 1:13:29.150
was far more interesting to me

1:13:29.192 --> 1:13:30.857
than to anyone else.

1:13:39.608 --> 1:13:42.066
It's been two years
since I got to be Kate.

1:13:42.108 --> 1:13:46.525
It's been wonderful,
beyond my wildest dreams.

1:13:46.567 --> 1:13:48.192
Andrea sure is a gift.

1:13:49.608 --> 1:13:50.899
Maybe certain people
come into our lives

1:13:50.941 --> 1:13:53.024
to help us be who we are,

1:13:54.233 --> 1:13:57.692
and to help us get
to be who we can be.

1:14:43.982 --> 1:14:46.774
You're beautiful, Kate.

1:14:46.816 --> 1:14:48.816
I'm glad you think so.

1:14:51.982 --> 1:14:56.275
I wish you could see
yourself as beautiful.

1:14:56.317 --> 1:14:57.192
I'll try.

1:14:59.024 --> 1:15:00.983
You say it.

1:15:01.025 --> 1:15:02.192
I'm beautiful?

1:15:06.732 --> 1:15:08.941
Say it like you mean it.

1:15:11.608 --> 1:15:12.941
I'm beautiful.

1:15:14.067 --> 1:15:15.941
You are beautiful.

1:15:17.067 --> 1:15:19.815
I don't think you would've

1:15:19.857 --> 1:15:21.857
gone through all of this

1:15:23.025 --> 1:15:26.108
if you didn't think
you were beautiful.

1:15:27.108 --> 1:15:27.941
Well,

1:15:30.941 --> 1:15:33.983
it became more a
matter of survival.

1:15:34.025 --> 1:15:36.940
I didn't know how much
longer I'd make it as,

1:15:36.982 --> 1:15:38.525
what's his name.

1:15:40.691 --> 1:15:43.567
I like you just
as you are, Kate.

1:15:47.067 --> 1:15:49.608
Well, I sure didn't expect this.

1:15:49.650 --> 1:15:52.567
Oh, I didn't
expect this, either.

1:16:04.233 --> 1:16:07.192
You want to take
your jacket off?

1:16:23.442 --> 1:16:26.192
I haven't done
this in a while.

1:16:27.233 --> 1:16:28.983
I haven't either.

1:16:30.358 --> 1:16:33.400
You might have questions.

1:16:33.442 --> 1:16:35.608
Whatever is just fine.

1:16:57.067 --> 1:16:58.108
Stuck.

1:17:02.317 --> 1:17:04.025
You have a tattoo.

1:17:23.275 --> 1:17:24.358
Come with me.

1:17:50.067 --> 1:17:54.025
I'm not that heavy.

1:17:59.358 --> 1:18:00.317
Here I come.

1:19:02.275 --> 1:19:03.275
Hi Kate.

1:19:03.317 --> 1:19:04.900
Hi Andrea.

1:19:04.942 --> 1:19:06.816
I have a Yoga class
first thing Monday morning,

1:19:06.858 --> 1:19:08.233
so I just took off.

1:19:09.566 --> 1:19:12.025
Oh, I had wondered
where you'd gone.

1:19:12.067 --> 1:19:14.358
Yeah, I'm sorry to worry you.

1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:15.900
Oh, that's okay.

1:19:18.400 --> 1:19:19.983
Would you like to come in?

1:19:20.025 --> 1:19:21.400
Oh, no thanks.

1:19:21.442 --> 1:19:24.275
I can only stay
for just a second.

1:19:26.067 --> 1:19:27.191
Everything okay?

1:19:27.233 --> 1:19:28.275
Well...

1:19:31.858 --> 1:19:33.275
Yeah, I guess so.

1:19:35.150 --> 1:19:38.983
But, would you be okay
if we took a break here

1:19:39.942 --> 1:19:41.358
for a little bit?

1:19:45.983 --> 1:19:48.191
What kind of break?

1:19:48.233 --> 1:19:50.192
Well, I don't know.

1:19:52.482 --> 1:19:56.316
One of my brothers is in
town for a little while,

1:19:56.358 --> 1:20:00.317
so I'd like to at least
wait until he's gone, and,

1:20:01.983 --> 1:20:03.482
see how I'm feeling.

1:20:04.317 --> 1:20:06.025
Okay.

1:20:06.067 --> 1:20:07.067
I'm sorry.

1:20:08.108 --> 1:20:09.108
It's okay.

1:20:11.317 --> 1:20:12.317
I'm sorry.

1:20:13.317 --> 1:20:15.192
I'll be in touch, okay?

1:20:22.399 --> 1:20:25.150
Actually, that's not it at all.

1:20:29.108 --> 1:20:31.275
I'm struggling here, Kate.

1:20:37.441 --> 1:20:42.441
I'm not supposed to have
fallen in love with a woman.

1:20:43.067 --> 1:20:43.482
But I have.

1:20:47.900 --> 1:20:50.983
And I'm not sure
what to do about it.

1:20:54.108 --> 1:20:57.358
I need some time to
sit with that, and,

1:20:59.275 --> 1:21:00.067
I'm sorry.

1:21:04.399 --> 1:21:05.399
It's okay.

1:21:09.441 --> 1:21:10.941
Thank you.

1:21:10.983 --> 1:21:12.524
I will be in touch.

1:21:12.566 --> 1:21:14.524
I'll call you.

1:21:14.566 --> 1:21:16.317
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

1:21:39.067 --> 1:21:40.524
Hello,
this is Andrea.

1:21:40.566 --> 1:21:42.191
Please leave a message,

1:21:42.233 --> 1:21:43.025
- and I will call you back.
- Andrea opened

1:21:43.067 --> 1:21:44.524
the door to love.

1:21:44.566 --> 1:21:48.565
Loving me has to be way
outside her comfort zone.

1:21:48.607 --> 1:21:50.399
But whatever happens,

1:21:50.441 --> 1:21:51.650
it was really wonderful

1:21:51.692 --> 1:21:53.399
to have that little glimpse

1:21:53.441 --> 1:21:57.357
of the sweet, powerful
love that she offered.

1:22:17.524 --> 1:22:20.524
Oh Katie, where
did you come from?

1:22:23.524 --> 1:22:25.524
Where did you come from?

1:22:56.441 --> 1:22:58.191
You sure you live here?

1:22:58.233 --> 1:22:59.316
This is it.

1:23:00.524 --> 1:23:01.357
Wow.

1:23:05.150 --> 1:23:05.983
I love it.

1:23:08.192 --> 1:23:12.025
Yeah, it's the first
time I used a designer.

1:23:14.482 --> 1:23:15.316
Alright.

1:23:16.775 --> 1:23:17.733
Can I?

1:23:17.775 --> 1:23:19.399
Sure, go ahead.

1:23:32.482 --> 1:23:34.483
So do you want to go
somewhere tomorrow,

1:23:34.525 --> 1:23:37.274
or do you just want to hang out?

1:23:37.316 --> 1:23:39.357
I'm okay with whatever.

1:23:43.357 --> 1:23:46.525
How are you and Thomas doing?

1:23:46.567 --> 1:23:48.691
He's gone back to school.

1:23:48.733 --> 1:23:50.441
Oh, that's good.

1:23:51.274 --> 1:23:52.274
That's good.

1:24:06.567 --> 1:24:10.150
Mama Kate, you're acting
more like my father today.

1:24:10.191 --> 1:24:14.525
It's weird, but I'm kinda
happy to have him back.

1:24:14.567 --> 1:24:15.525
You said a few months ago

1:24:15.567 --> 1:24:18.232
that I'm pretty much the same.

1:24:18.274 --> 1:24:20.274
Well, Papa had this...

1:24:23.650 --> 1:24:25.608
I don't know, I guess
you'd call it, like,

1:24:25.650 --> 1:24:27.816
an underlying sadness.

1:24:27.858 --> 1:24:29.190
And when you got
to me, Mama Kate,

1:24:29.232 --> 1:24:30.525
I didn't see that anymore,

1:24:30.567 --> 1:24:32.733
but today, I see it again.

1:24:39.316 --> 1:24:40.149
Well,

1:24:43.692 --> 1:24:44.608
these last few weeks,

1:24:44.650 --> 1:24:48.442
I've just been bolling
over with happiness.

1:24:49.650 --> 1:24:53.650
I didn't know one person
could even be that happy.

1:24:56.525 --> 1:24:57.567
I met a friend,

1:24:58.817 --> 1:25:01.775
and she's become
more than a friend.

1:25:04.483 --> 1:25:05.316
And I,

1:25:08.942 --> 1:25:12.149
I'm waiting for her
to come to her senses,

1:25:12.191 --> 1:25:13.274
and leave me.

1:25:15.483 --> 1:25:17.274
Why would you say that?

1:25:19.692 --> 1:25:23.650
Well, I bring a lot
of baggage with me,

1:25:23.692 --> 1:25:27.525
and maybe I'm too old
to start all this again.

1:25:34.775 --> 1:25:36.900
I can be happy living alone.

1:25:47.442 --> 1:25:51.274
Mama Kate, I'm on my
second marriage, right?

1:25:52.775 --> 1:25:55.442
And I'm going to make this work.

1:25:56.650 --> 1:25:59.775
I am going to give
everything I have

1:25:59.817 --> 1:26:01.650
to make this one work.

1:26:05.274 --> 1:26:06.775
And if it doesn't,

1:26:10.442 --> 1:26:12.983
'cause they don't always,

1:26:13.025 --> 1:26:15.733
at least I will
know that I tried,

1:26:15.775 --> 1:26:17.817
and it sounds so dumb,

1:26:18.817 --> 1:26:21.483
but I know that I
would love again.

1:26:21.525 --> 1:26:22.650
We can't help it, you know?

1:26:22.692 --> 1:26:24.692
It's like, how we're built.

1:26:27.817 --> 1:26:29.566
I'm glad
for you, Casey.

1:26:29.608 --> 1:26:31.775
You've been through a lot.

1:26:37.817 --> 1:26:40.358
You know how your
neighbor has a love bird?

1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:41.733
I thought
it was a parrot.

1:26:41.775 --> 1:26:43.566
Mama, that's what
love birds are.

1:26:43.608 --> 1:26:44.483
Oh.

1:26:44.525 --> 1:26:46.441
Anyways, they only
have one of them,

1:26:46.483 --> 1:26:48.900
and they're not
supposed to be alone.

1:26:48.942 --> 1:26:49.858
They don't do well.

1:26:49.900 --> 1:26:53.275
They get erratic in captivity.

1:26:53.317 --> 1:26:56.483
Some people are just
meant to pair up.

1:26:58.066 --> 1:27:00.733
If you really like this person,

1:27:00.775 --> 1:27:03.232
as much as it seems you do,

1:27:03.900 --> 1:27:06.733
then I think that you should try

1:27:07.733 --> 1:27:11.608
and give everything you
can to be with them.

1:27:14.733 --> 1:27:15.608
It's funny, Mama Kate.

1:27:15.650 --> 1:27:16.691
I feel like I can talk to you

1:27:16.733 --> 1:27:19.483
more than I ever
could with Papa.

1:27:21.775 --> 1:27:22.608
Yeah.

1:27:23.650 --> 1:27:24.691
It's nice.

1:27:24.733 --> 1:27:26.232
Yeah.

1:27:27.608 --> 1:27:30.525
Oh Casey and
her talk of love birds.

1:27:30.567 --> 1:27:32.608
Actually, all birds
shed their feathers

1:27:32.650 --> 1:27:34.900
and replace them with new ones.

1:27:34.942 --> 1:27:37.733
Maybe that's what
I've needed to do

1:27:37.775 --> 1:27:39.691
so that I could find love.

1:27:39.733 --> 1:27:41.733
And let myself be loved.

1:27:46.733 --> 1:27:47.775
So Tom.

1:27:49.442 --> 1:27:50.275
Yeah?

1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:55.566
And Tom Flynn, down.

1:27:55.608 --> 1:27:57.024
I've met someone.

1:27:58.650 --> 1:28:01.442
And I believe I've
fallen in love.

1:28:02.608 --> 1:28:03.733
He was 10 for 14.

1:28:03.775 --> 1:28:04.691
Under 10 yards.

1:28:04.733 --> 1:28:06.691
That's the patience
part we talked about.

1:28:06.733 --> 1:28:08.442
Did you hear me?

1:28:09.358 --> 1:28:11.691
Yeah, I heard you.

1:28:11.733 --> 1:28:12.900
You fell in love.

1:28:12.941 --> 1:28:15.483
Yeah, I've fallen in love.

1:28:16.733 --> 1:28:17.941
Her name is Kate.

1:28:20.817 --> 1:28:22.024
Really?

1:28:22.066 --> 1:28:22.900
Yep.

1:28:25.024 --> 1:28:26.691
You know, it seemed like

1:28:26.733 --> 1:28:29.567
you might be happier
with a woman.

1:28:30.692 --> 1:28:33.775
Well Tom, it sure
feels that way.

1:28:33.817 --> 1:28:37.316
I don't think I've
ever been in love.

1:28:37.358 --> 1:28:40.691
Someone knocked it away.

1:28:40.733 --> 1:28:42.733
John Elway, he did
a quarrel on that.

1:28:42.775 --> 1:28:45.024
There's a little
more to the story.

1:28:45.066 --> 1:28:46.899
He's
gonna spin right around.

1:28:46.941 --> 1:28:48.982
She was born transgender.

1:28:50.066 --> 1:28:51.733
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:28:51.775 --> 1:28:53.941
Okay I'm gonna sit down.

1:28:55.941 --> 1:28:58.940
I better sit down
for this, I can see.

1:29:00.899 --> 1:29:01.941
Oh Tom.

1:29:04.858 --> 1:29:06.858
She's just wonderful.

1:29:09.192 --> 1:29:13.858
One
handed catch by Van Johnson.

1:29:13.899 --> 1:29:14.858
You know,

1:29:18.982 --> 1:29:22.982
the message I got from
Dad, I'm sure it was Dad,

1:29:24.608 --> 1:29:27.024
was that I was supposed to
fall in love with a man,

1:29:27.066 --> 1:29:28.941
be married to a man,

1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:32.982
and be taken care of by a man.

1:29:33.024 --> 1:29:34.650
Johnson makes the tackle,

1:29:34.692 --> 1:29:37.108
or the catch when he's down.

1:29:37.150 --> 1:29:40.566
So to fall in
love with a woman

1:29:40.608 --> 1:29:43.066
has presented a challenge to me.

1:29:45.442 --> 1:29:47.775
You know, do I
listen to my heart,

1:29:47.817 --> 1:29:50.400
do I listen to the
message in my head?

1:29:50.442 --> 1:29:52.940
That's
why Dan Reeves was so upset.

1:29:52.982 --> 1:29:55.940
And it's been a struggle,

1:29:55.982 --> 1:29:58.899
but it just comes
down to my heart.

1:30:00.107 --> 1:30:01.483
I, I love her.

1:30:05.150 --> 1:30:06.733
And she loves me.

1:30:12.567 --> 1:30:14.899
What can be wrong with that?

1:30:27.275 --> 1:30:29.024
Would you get that?

1:30:30.816 --> 1:30:31.650
Sure?

1:30:37.899 --> 1:30:39.024
Oh, hi.

1:30:39.066 --> 1:30:40.899
You must be Casey.

1:30:40.941 --> 1:30:41.982
Are you Andrea?

1:30:42.024 --> 1:30:43.024
I am.

1:30:44.024 --> 1:30:45.483
Come in, please.

1:30:49.192 --> 1:30:51.982
Mama Kate's just putting
some things away in the back.

1:30:52.024 --> 1:30:54.233
Let me get her for you.

1:30:54.275 --> 1:30:56.857
Hey Mama Kate, Andrea's here.

1:30:58.067 --> 1:30:59.191
She'll be really
happy to see you.

1:30:59.233 --> 1:31:00.899
I'll be happy to see her, too.

1:31:00.941 --> 1:31:02.525
It's very nice to meet you.

1:31:02.567 --> 1:31:03.192
You too.

1:31:09.192 --> 1:31:10.192
Hi Andrea.

1:31:11.899 --> 1:31:12.733
Hi Kate.

1:31:15.067 --> 1:31:16.067
How are you?

1:31:18.150 --> 1:31:19.067
I'm okay.

1:31:19.982 --> 1:31:20.982
How are you?

1:31:24.650 --> 1:31:27.525
I think I'm gonna go
lay down for a little bit.

1:31:27.567 --> 1:31:28.940
It was really nice to meet you.

1:31:28.982 --> 1:31:30.108
Nice to
meet you too, Casey.

1:31:30.150 --> 1:31:31.108
Love you.

1:31:31.150 --> 1:31:31.982
Good luck.

1:31:35.899 --> 1:31:37.525
Can we sit down?

1:31:37.567 --> 1:31:38.150
Sure.

1:31:54.025 --> 1:31:56.567
Kate, the words to love songs

1:31:58.732 --> 1:32:01.108
have never made any sense to me.

1:32:02.650 --> 1:32:06.608
It was just like a language
I didn't understand.

1:32:07.732 --> 1:32:09.067
Until I met you.

1:32:10.567 --> 1:32:11.982
And now I get it.

1:32:13.025 --> 1:32:14.650
I love you, Kate.

1:32:19.358 --> 1:32:23.066
Well, I feel like my
life has just started,

1:32:23.108 --> 1:32:25.525
and I'm already pushing 70.

1:32:27.983 --> 1:32:32.774
Sometimes, I wonder if I'll
even make it another 10 years.

1:32:34.358 --> 1:32:38.732
I want to make most of
these years that I do have.

1:32:39.732 --> 1:32:41.690
Once I got to be Kate,

1:32:41.732 --> 1:32:44.650
I was living just
the perfect life.

1:32:47.691 --> 1:32:51.233
I didn't think it was
possible to be happier.

1:32:52.774 --> 1:32:54.150
But with you, I am.

1:32:55.941 --> 1:32:57.275
I love you, Andrea.

1:32:59.816 --> 1:33:01.108
I love you, Kate.

1:33:15.150 --> 1:33:18.150
I feel like such
a mess sometimes.

1:33:18.192 --> 1:33:19.732
Oh, we all do.

1:33:22.816 --> 1:33:26.816
And I worry that I might
lose my mind someday.

1:33:29.067 --> 1:33:33.025
If that happened, would
you take care of me?

1:33:33.067 --> 1:33:35.358
I'd take care of you.

1:33:35.400 --> 1:33:38.150
We could take care
of each other.

1:33:44.732 --> 1:33:47.025
Do you wish I
hadn't transitioned?

1:33:47.067 --> 1:33:50.900
That I was still
pretending to be a man?

1:33:50.942 --> 1:33:52.233
Oh Kate.

1:33:52.275 --> 1:33:53.900
I wouldn't have given
you a second look,

1:33:53.942 --> 1:33:55.275
'cause you're too short.

1:33:58.233 --> 1:33:59.067
Well.

1:34:01.816 --> 1:34:04.316
Hey, do you like road trips?

1:34:04.358 --> 1:34:08.108
I think a road trip with
you would be fantastic.

1:34:08.150 --> 1:34:11.108
Do you know that Johnny Cash
song, "I've Been Everywhere."

1:34:11.150 --> 1:34:12.900
♪ I've been everywhere, man ♪

1:34:12.942 --> 1:34:14.316
Yeah, I like Johnny Cash.

1:34:14.358 --> 1:34:15.941
Yeah, how'd you like to go

1:34:15.983 --> 1:34:17.774
to all those places in the song?

1:34:17.816 --> 1:34:20.191
All those places?
How many are there?

1:34:20.233 --> 1:34:21.941
There are 92 of 'em.

1:34:21.983 --> 1:34:25.233
- They're all over the place.
- Oh my gosh.

1:34:25.275 --> 1:34:27.108
Well, what's the closest one?

1:34:27.150 --> 1:34:29.192
I think Crater Lake.

1:34:31.025 --> 1:34:34.066
Well, that's
just down the road.

1:34:34.108 --> 1:34:35.316
Do you want to go?

1:34:35.358 --> 1:34:36.192
I do.

1:34:37.732 --> 1:34:39.358
How about next week?

1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:43.108
Let's go, Katie bird.

1:35:01.025 --> 1:35:02.233
I love you, Andrea.
