WEBVTT

00:02.031 --> 00:03.932
You're only here because
we need your help.

00:03.934 --> 00:06.268
If you could write
down a couple of names

00:06.270 --> 00:08.103
of people that can
vouch for your answers,

00:08.106 --> 00:09.738
we can all go our merry way.

00:09.740 --> 00:12.141
Till we find Rizzuto,
I'll have her followed.

00:12.143 --> 00:14.577
Where do you work?
Never asked you that.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.845
_

00:18.348 --> 00:20.148
It's a boring secretarial job.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.550
You won't lose any points. Don't worry.

00:22.552 --> 00:25.520
- Keep your distance.
- Susie.

00:25.522 --> 00:28.089
"When they were done staging
the photos for the press,

00:28.091 --> 00:30.191
the Air Force had the debris shipped

00:30.193 --> 00:32.192
from Fort Worth to Ohio".

00:32.195 --> 00:33.328
Our own backyard.

00:33.330 --> 00:34.529
If the government is covering up

00:34.531 --> 00:36.064
the existence of flying saucers,

00:36.066 --> 00:38.333
then you and I are in the best position

00:38.335 --> 00:39.700
to expose that truth.

00:39.702 --> 00:42.670
Are you willing to do that with me?

00:54.417 --> 00:56.483
This was a mistake.

00:58.487 --> 01:00.927
We don't even know who we're
supposed to be meeting right now.

01:03.059 --> 01:05.726
I understand the need for secrecy.

01:05.728 --> 01:07.088
If you did, you'd be more worried.

01:08.397 --> 01:10.698
Mysterious man calls the
congressional switchboard

01:10.700 --> 01:12.499
claiming to have classified information

01:12.501 --> 01:14.032
that points to the existence of UFOs?

01:16.139 --> 01:18.739
He talked about wanting
to expose the truth.

01:18.741 --> 01:20.107
We could use the help.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.746
Just don't forget,
the last guy we trusted

01:25.748 --> 01:27.514
almost got us locked up.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.750
_

01:41.563 --> 01:43.363
Oh, just, I remembered I promised Joel

01:43.365 --> 01:44.997
I'd bring him something
back from the Capitol.

01:44.999 --> 01:46.566
Well, grab him something from the base.

01:46.568 --> 01:48.601
He'll love it just as much.

01:48.603 --> 01:50.803
Faye? It's late.

01:52.489 --> 01:53.778
What's this?

01:53.780 --> 01:57.243
A little thank-you from
the generals... and me.

01:57.245 --> 01:59.879
Well, what do you know?
"For your fine work in D.C."

01:59.881 --> 02:02.682
We all watched the
press conference on TV.

02:02.684 --> 02:04.117
You're famous.

02:04.119 --> 02:05.885
Just what I've always wanted.

02:05.887 --> 02:07.320
Things are gonna be different now.

02:07.322 --> 02:08.621
Not if I can help it,

02:08.622 --> 02:10.389
which means no overtime for you,

02:10.392 --> 02:12.425
so thank you, Faye.

02:12.427 --> 02:13.565
Have a good night.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.623
Yes, sir, Captain. Professor.

02:16.625 --> 02:17.791
Night.

02:20.234 --> 02:23.502
She is right, you know.
Things are gonna be different.

02:23.504 --> 02:24.836
People know us now.

02:24.838 --> 02:25.999
Well, if they really knew us,

02:26.001 --> 02:28.514
they would have bought
bourbon instead of champagne.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.827
We have any flutes?

02:29.829 --> 02:31.017
Let me check.

02:31.019 --> 02:32.285
All right.

02:40.554 --> 02:41.820
Can I help you?

02:41.822 --> 02:43.054
It's okay.

02:43.056 --> 02:44.862
I'm here 'cause I need your help.

02:44.864 --> 02:46.625
- So who are you?
- John.

02:46.627 --> 02:47.826
I work on the base.

02:47.828 --> 02:49.394
Enlisted?

02:49.396 --> 02:52.764
No, Captain, I'm not enlisted.

02:52.766 --> 02:56.067
Officially... I don't exist.

02:59.706 --> 03:03.642
Okay, tell us everything you know.

03:03.644 --> 03:06.310
Hangar 18.

03:06.312 --> 03:09.247
That's what they call it,
but it's not really a hangar.

03:09.249 --> 03:10.815
It looks like a storage building.

03:10.817 --> 03:12.917
The real lab is six floors below.

03:12.919 --> 03:15.787
That's where I work. I'm
a mechanical engineer.

03:15.789 --> 03:17.758
When the Air Force
hired me, they told me

03:17.760 --> 03:19.090
I was working for something called

03:19.092 --> 03:22.260
the Technical Air Intelligence Unit.

03:22.262 --> 03:25.163
I was supposed to be
analyzing, breaking down,

03:25.165 --> 03:27.298
and reverse engineering
Soviet technology,

03:27.300 --> 03:30.635
but the craft we've been working on,

03:30.637 --> 03:32.436
it's not Russian.

03:34.307 --> 03:37.909
And you believe this is
of extraterrestrial origin?

03:37.911 --> 03:42.513
The technology on these things, it's...

03:42.515 --> 03:45.916
it's beyond our
capabilities, way beyond.

03:45.918 --> 03:49.019
Things? As in multiple craft?

03:49.021 --> 03:50.545
I can get you proof,

03:50.547 --> 03:52.356
but I need to give it
to you off the base.

03:52.358 --> 03:54.825
Why tell us this now?

03:54.827 --> 03:56.860
My brother died in the war,

03:56.862 --> 03:58.162
so when I see these reports

03:58.164 --> 04:00.498
about Russians being
responsible for UFOs,

04:00.500 --> 04:02.700
it makes me think that people here,

04:02.702 --> 04:04.569
they wanna start another one.

04:07.373 --> 04:12.212
You're the agency that wants
to expose the truth, right?

04:12.214 --> 04:14.712
Through science? Here's some.

04:16.716 --> 04:18.194
I left an address in there as well.

04:18.196 --> 04:20.517
If you can meet me off the base,

04:20.519 --> 04:22.426
I can get you more proof then.

04:23.555 --> 04:26.323
I'll meet you at that
address in two hours.

04:43.242 --> 04:44.574
I got it out.

04:47.713 --> 04:49.947
Son of a bitch.

04:49.949 --> 04:52.415
This bastard might be telling the truth.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.788
I don't think he's coming.

04:57.790 --> 05:00.124
He's ten minutes late.

05:00.126 --> 05:02.392
Underground lab at Wright-Patt,

05:02.394 --> 05:05.462
reverse engineering UFOs...

05:05.464 --> 05:06.896
you know how crazy that sounds.

05:06.898 --> 05:08.431
Would be ironic, though.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.800
Traveling all around in search of UFOs,

05:10.802 --> 05:13.836
and it's right beneath
our feet this entire time.

05:18.610 --> 05:19.741
He's here.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.326
Soldier?

05:38.363 --> 05:41.264
Sir, the generals need to
see you both right away.

05:41.266 --> 05:43.400
We had an incident here last night.

05:45.704 --> 05:47.069
An airman tried to take

05:47.071 --> 05:49.638
highly classified material off the base.

05:52.543 --> 05:54.075
Luckily our military police

05:54.077 --> 05:56.745
intercepted him before he could.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.614
After interviewing him, we know

05:58.616 --> 06:01.274
that he stopped by your office
and wanted to meet you tonight.

06:04.322 --> 06:07.022
Do you know why he wanted
to meet you tonight?

06:07.024 --> 06:09.358
Sir, he said he had a case for us.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.526
Which was?

06:10.528 --> 06:13.261
Sir, he said he'd rather
talk about it off base.

06:17.234 --> 06:20.101
Is there something else we should know?

06:20.103 --> 06:22.671
Is there something else
we should know, Professor?

06:24.508 --> 06:26.375
Let's put it this way.

06:26.377 --> 06:30.111
In the future, if anyone from this base

06:30.113 --> 06:33.681
comes to you with
stories of flying saucers

06:33.683 --> 06:35.984
or any other fucking
thing, for that matter,

06:35.986 --> 06:37.919
you're to run it through us.

06:37.921 --> 06:40.021
- Is that understood?
- Yes, General.

06:40.023 --> 06:42.090
Professor?

06:42.092 --> 06:43.358
Whatever you'd like.

06:44.461 --> 06:47.295
I'd like to feel like you mean it,

06:47.297 --> 06:51.499
because if you don't, we have a problem.

07:02.913 --> 07:04.612
Project Blue Book?

07:07.017 --> 07:09.417
- Andrew Garner.
- Captain Michael Quinn.

07:09.419 --> 07:10.886
Allen Hynek.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.920
Sorry for the cloak and dagger.

07:12.922 --> 07:15.356
It's really for both our benefits,

07:15.358 --> 07:17.224
given all the prying eyes in the city.

07:21.931 --> 07:24.866
Garner... how do I know that name?

07:24.868 --> 07:27.735
Oh, I've been around
Washington a long time.

07:27.737 --> 07:30.405
Are you State Department, Defense?

07:30.407 --> 07:32.106
I don't like to limit myself.

07:32.108 --> 07:34.008
Are you the man I spoke to on the phone?

07:34.010 --> 07:37.712
Yes, although I should
have been more clear.

07:37.714 --> 07:39.814
I'm here on behalf of someone else.

07:39.816 --> 07:43.017
- Who's that?
- Can't disclose that yet.

07:47.089 --> 07:50.157
What I can disclose is
that if you do what I say,

07:50.159 --> 07:51.792
you will have the chance to testify

07:51.794 --> 07:53.727
at a public congressional hearing

07:53.729 --> 07:56.763
that will finally expose the
truth about flying saucers.

07:59.568 --> 08:03.003
I represent someone who
believes, like you do,

08:03.005 --> 08:05.672
that there's a conspiracy going on

08:05.674 --> 08:08.175
at the highest level of the government

08:08.177 --> 08:11.678
to cover up the existence
of extraterrestrial life.

08:11.680 --> 08:15.882
And he thinks it could not
only cost us the Cold War

08:15.884 --> 08:18.718
but our long-term security as well.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.520
What do you want from us?

08:20.522 --> 08:22.356
I want you to know you
have a friend in Congress

08:22.358 --> 08:24.039
willing to put his neck out for you...

08:25.828 --> 08:28.562
If you can deliver more
proof of a cover-up.

08:28.564 --> 08:30.263
Deliver proof?

08:30.265 --> 08:32.599
What, you want us to spy
on our own government?

08:32.601 --> 08:34.467
Captain, were you aware that two weeks

08:34.470 --> 08:37.203
after your encounter in
D.C., an Air Force pilot

08:37.205 --> 08:41.407
chased a similar set of
lights in Tacoma, Washington?

08:41.409 --> 08:44.205
Only when his plane spun out of control,

08:44.207 --> 08:45.846
he died.

08:45.848 --> 08:48.314
That could have been you,

08:48.316 --> 08:49.916
which means it's only a matter of time

08:49.918 --> 08:51.785
before it happens again.

08:51.787 --> 08:54.521
And given the Cold
War climate right now,

08:54.523 --> 08:56.723
all it will take is for
some trigger-happy general

08:56.725 --> 08:58.617
to convince a new administration

08:58.619 --> 09:01.194
that it's Russians tripping our radars,

09:01.196 --> 09:03.630
and we're in the
middle of World War III.

09:09.839 --> 09:11.227
Those are classified sightings

09:11.229 --> 09:12.938
that didn't get reported to Blue Book.

09:12.940 --> 09:14.874
They are being held as exhibit "A"

09:14.876 --> 09:16.174
in the march to war.

09:16.176 --> 09:18.076
These all took place at military bases.

09:18.078 --> 09:19.211
That's right.

09:19.213 --> 09:20.813
Where'd you get these files?

09:22.149 --> 09:25.217
Gentlemen, the man I represent
thinks that exposing the truth

09:25.219 --> 09:26.585
can bring this world together,

09:26.587 --> 09:28.220
not pit us against each other,

09:28.222 --> 09:30.047
which means your work has the chance

09:30.049 --> 09:32.691
to not only save lives...

09:32.693 --> 09:34.627
but change the course of human history.

09:45.096 --> 09:48.096
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

10:06.068 --> 10:08.603
That case he was talking about...

10:08.605 --> 10:11.037
radar echoes picked up
by McChord Air Force Base

10:11.039 --> 10:13.240
were identical to the ones in D.C.

10:13.242 --> 10:16.376
Pilot who encountered them,
he radioed in a mayday call

10:16.378 --> 10:19.666
before slamming into a
mountain at 750 miles an hour

10:19.668 --> 10:21.567
with no attempt to eject.

10:22.403 --> 10:24.036
Let me see that.

10:30.378 --> 10:33.779
Captain Quinn, do you copy?

10:34.849 --> 10:36.181
Do you copy?

10:39.053 --> 10:41.286
It's taking control!

10:41.288 --> 10:42.588
You shouldn't have kept these.

10:45.393 --> 10:47.760
You don't know
Washington like I do, Doc.

10:47.762 --> 10:48.818
We're being used.

10:48.820 --> 10:50.863
Support like this is exactly
what we need right now.

10:50.865 --> 10:52.431
You and I have both seen firsthand

10:52.433 --> 10:54.000
what happens to anyone
trying to come forward

10:54.002 --> 10:56.168
with evidence of a cover-up.

10:56.170 --> 10:58.905
You just don't trust politicians.

10:58.907 --> 11:01.006
Especially the ones who
don't show their face.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.707
You trust me, don't you?

11:02.709 --> 11:05.077
You're the only person
I trust right now.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.647
We gotta tread carefully with this one.

11:08.649 --> 11:11.250
You don't have to
worry about me, Captain.

11:11.252 --> 11:13.652
I'm always on your side.

11:57.430 --> 11:59.430
I know you're listening.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.971
This is your last chance to speak to me.

12:05.973 --> 12:09.006
You need to come in so
we can help you, Mishka.

12:09.008 --> 12:10.561
Like how you tried to help me last time?

12:10.563 --> 12:13.144
This is bigger than you
now, and you know that.

12:13.146 --> 12:15.079
If their government is following you...

12:15.081 --> 12:16.247
I know how to lose a tail.

12:18.251 --> 12:19.817
I only came here to get rid of evidence

12:19.819 --> 12:23.121
so that you don't have
to, and then I'm gone.

12:23.123 --> 12:25.956
You went there hoping
you'd see him again

12:25.958 --> 12:29.427
because you love him, don't you?

12:29.429 --> 12:31.395
That's always been your problem.

12:31.397 --> 12:34.732
Your loyalties shift so easily, Mishka.

12:34.734 --> 12:36.400
I've sent our best men for you,

12:36.402 --> 12:38.902
and you just left the base,
so you don't have a weap...

12:47.546 --> 12:50.347
- It's locked?
- That's weird.

12:50.349 --> 12:52.016
Who are all these people?

12:52.018 --> 12:54.151
Excuse me?

12:54.153 --> 12:55.185
Hello?

12:58.995 --> 13:00.423
Can I help you?

13:00.425 --> 13:02.292
You could step aside and let us in.

13:02.294 --> 13:03.527
Who are you?

13:03.529 --> 13:05.729
I'm Captain Michael Quinn.
This is Dr. Allen Hynek.

13:05.731 --> 13:06.997
We work here. Who are you?

13:06.999 --> 13:09.533
Sergeant, you can
let them in. Thank you.

13:09.535 --> 13:12.502
Captain Quinn, Dr. Hynek.

13:12.504 --> 13:13.603
What's going on here?

13:13.605 --> 13:14.838
Special Agent Stevens,

13:14.840 --> 13:16.773
Air Force Office of
Special Investigations.

13:16.775 --> 13:17.874
Faye?

13:17.876 --> 13:18.908
Come this way, please.

13:18.910 --> 13:20.410
We're almost done interviewing her.

13:20.412 --> 13:21.511
What is happening here?

13:21.513 --> 13:23.180
Other offices associated

13:23.182 --> 13:24.981
with this program were burglarized.

13:24.983 --> 13:27.517
Highly classified
materials have been stolen,

13:27.519 --> 13:29.519
making this a matter
of national security.

13:29.521 --> 13:31.120
Until we've completed our investigation,

13:31.122 --> 13:33.557
Blue Book is shut down indefinitely.

13:41.099 --> 13:43.433
- Hey.
- What's the latest?

13:43.435 --> 13:47.304
OSI is just getting
started, so nothing yet.

13:47.306 --> 13:50.073
They don't know what's
in the actual files.

13:50.075 --> 13:51.274
Not a clue.

13:51.276 --> 13:53.075
Well, I'm gonna go get in a few rounds

13:53.077 --> 13:55.143
and work off some of this stress.

13:55.145 --> 13:57.379
Did you know the boys were in D.C.?

13:59.049 --> 14:00.316
Friend of mine from the State Department

14:00.318 --> 14:01.717
flagged it for me.

14:01.719 --> 14:04.320
Saw them having a powwow
with Andrew Garner.

14:04.322 --> 14:05.354
Garner?

14:06.725 --> 14:08.781
Do we know who he's
working for this time?

14:08.783 --> 14:12.094
New administration... it's hard to tell.

14:12.096 --> 14:14.530
Garner's covering his
tracks, which makes me

14:14.532 --> 14:15.864
all the more suspicious.

14:17.335 --> 14:20.236
I think it's time we call
in that favor from Daniel,

14:20.238 --> 14:22.471
see who the hell Garner's representing.

14:22.473 --> 14:23.572
It's already done...

14:26.043 --> 14:27.543
But you're not gonna like it.

14:27.545 --> 14:29.111
What do you mean?

14:29.113 --> 14:31.447
The CIA does things a little bit

14:31.449 --> 14:32.881
differently than you or I.

14:34.517 --> 14:36.885
Captain, this is still a crime scene.

14:39.223 --> 14:41.089
It's also my office.

14:41.091 --> 14:42.991
No, actually, it's my office now.

14:42.993 --> 14:45.360
So look, what exactly was stolen

14:45.362 --> 14:46.561
and from where?

14:46.563 --> 14:47.929
Highly sensitive files

14:47.931 --> 14:49.631
from General Valentine
and General Harding.

14:49.633 --> 14:51.066
Our concern is that the burglary

14:51.068 --> 14:53.902
may have expanded to include
these offices as well.

14:53.904 --> 14:55.060
When did this happen?

14:55.062 --> 14:56.171
The past 48 hours.

15:01.245 --> 15:04.146
When's the last time either
of you set foot in this office?

15:04.148 --> 15:05.446
Monday.

15:05.448 --> 15:07.548
Spent the last couple of days in D.C.

15:07.550 --> 15:08.573
You can verify this?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.385
He just did, because he was with me.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.052
Captain, I'm sure you can appreciate

15:12.054 --> 15:14.221
we have to investigate
every possible suspect.

15:14.223 --> 15:15.590
- Course.
- Sir, we need you in here.

15:15.592 --> 15:17.725
I can assure you that we'll
get to the bottom of it.

15:17.727 --> 15:19.093
Excuse me, gentlemen.

15:23.366 --> 15:24.399
You think that...

15:24.401 --> 15:26.233
Just take that and get out of here.

15:26.235 --> 15:28.035
I'll stick around and
see what I can find out.

16:06.283 --> 16:07.382
Hello?

16:12.522 --> 16:14.121
You and I have both seen firsthand

16:14.123 --> 16:15.756
what happens to anyone
trying to come forward

16:15.758 --> 16:17.525
with evidence of a cover-up.

16:19.462 --> 16:21.095
Allen?

16:22.532 --> 16:24.432
When did you get home?

16:24.434 --> 16:26.133
Few minutes ago.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.225
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:29.227 --> 16:30.559
You okay?

16:30.561 --> 16:33.262
Yeah, I thought I saw
someone on the patio.

16:34.399 --> 16:37.256
- Hello, Susie.
- There was someone outside?

16:37.258 --> 16:39.168
Oh, no, it was just my imagination.

16:45.109 --> 16:48.410
Is something going on?

16:48.412 --> 16:50.846
Cal came back.

16:50.848 --> 16:52.381
Her husband, Cal?

16:52.383 --> 16:54.683
You remember how he hit her before?

16:56.320 --> 16:59.154
She was really scared, so she asked

16:59.156 --> 17:00.931
if she could stay here
for a little while,

17:00.933 --> 17:03.492
- and I said yes.
- Does Quinn know?

17:11.068 --> 17:13.234
- Captain.
- You all right?

17:13.237 --> 17:14.435
What did they tell you?

17:14.438 --> 17:16.171
They didn't tell me
everything, but I got the...

17:16.173 --> 17:17.606
I didn't do it.

17:17.608 --> 17:19.374
I never imagined you would, Faye.

17:19.376 --> 17:22.242
I didn't tell them anything either.

17:22.244 --> 17:23.511
Do you...

17:26.249 --> 17:28.182
Do you know who stole the files?

17:30.219 --> 17:31.419
Faye.

17:31.421 --> 17:34.155
I'm really scared.

17:35.124 --> 17:36.558
Well, I'm here now.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.459
You have nothing to worry about.

17:38.461 --> 17:41.029
I'm not worried about me, Captain.

17:41.031 --> 17:42.997
I'm worried about you.

17:47.437 --> 17:49.170
Here you go.

17:49.172 --> 17:50.705
I made yours a double.

17:50.707 --> 17:52.006
Thank you,

17:52.008 --> 17:55.209
but I should probably keep
a clear head right now.

17:56.512 --> 17:57.878
Somebody out there?

18:06.222 --> 18:07.254
Do you know who that is?

18:07.256 --> 18:10.391
No, and I'm just being paranoid.

18:10.393 --> 18:11.758
I mean, Cal's crazy,

18:11.760 --> 18:14.095
but he's not having
people follow me, right?

18:14.097 --> 18:15.762
Let's call the police just to be sure.

18:15.764 --> 18:18.022
No, no, no, that would be overreacting.

18:18.024 --> 18:19.112
Cal is dangerous.

18:19.114 --> 18:21.068
I think it's better
to be safe than sorry.

18:21.070 --> 18:24.338
Well, you still have your gun, right?

18:24.340 --> 18:25.769
Yeah, it's in the bedroom,

18:25.771 --> 18:27.507
but I think we should
still call the police.

18:27.509 --> 18:29.842
I'm just going to have this drink.

18:31.313 --> 18:35.515
Please ignore me. My
mind's not working right.

18:39.087 --> 18:41.020
Joel's at a friend's house right now.

18:41.022 --> 18:44.324
I'm gonna call and make
sure he stays there.

18:44.326 --> 18:45.525
I'll be right back, okay?

19:08.549 --> 19:09.581
Hello.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.810
Hi, this is Mimi Hynek.

19:23.764 --> 19:26.965
I was wondering if I
could ask you a favor.

19:32.773 --> 19:34.906
It's just a bit of a crazy day.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.137
_

19:47.920 --> 19:48.952
Thank you.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.338
Blueprints of Wright-Patterson.

20:26.354 --> 20:28.611
Valentine.

20:28.613 --> 20:30.269
Susie?

20:46.778 --> 20:48.845
Susie?

20:48.847 --> 20:50.447
In here.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.593
Are you okay?

21:03.595 --> 21:05.027
I'll be out in a minute.

21:15.674 --> 21:17.406
Doc.

21:20.678 --> 21:22.878
- Captain.
- Doc.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.147
- I have to show you something.
- Is Mimi here?

21:25.149 --> 21:26.582
Yeah, somewhere.

21:26.584 --> 21:28.049
Those files from Garner...

21:28.051 --> 21:29.785
there's a picture in
there you have to see.

21:29.787 --> 21:32.454
Doc, I spoke with Faye.

21:32.456 --> 21:34.690
Pretty sure I know who broke
in and stole the files now.

21:34.692 --> 21:36.225
And was it Garner?

21:36.227 --> 21:37.326
No.

21:38.763 --> 21:40.496
Think it was your wife.

22:01.084 --> 22:04.051
I appreciate you arranging
this for us so quickly.

22:04.053 --> 22:05.286
No, you don't.

22:05.288 --> 22:07.788
It's what we agreed to
after the Robinson Panel.

22:07.790 --> 22:10.083
I owed you one for all
the trouble I caused.

22:10.085 --> 22:11.350
So how's this supposed to work?

22:11.352 --> 22:12.452
We're in a whorehouse.

22:12.454 --> 22:14.336
Yeah, well, this is a drug

22:14.338 --> 22:16.456
the agency has been
experimenting with in brothels

22:16.458 --> 22:17.824
for about six months now.

22:17.826 --> 22:19.456
We give that to the
ladies that work here,

22:19.458 --> 22:22.328
they give it to their johns,
ask all sorts of questions,

22:22.330 --> 22:23.362
and we watch.

22:23.364 --> 22:24.864
You watch, huh?

22:24.866 --> 22:27.166
Record the results
for research purposes.

22:27.168 --> 22:28.301
So what's in that stuff?

22:28.303 --> 22:31.571
Lysergic acid diethylamide, LSD.

22:31.573 --> 22:33.339
It has hallucinogenic properties,

22:33.341 --> 22:35.875
but we found success
with it as a truth serum.

22:35.877 --> 22:38.511
Just gotta watch the
dosage, or some people,

22:38.513 --> 22:41.014
they go into a different dimension.

22:41.016 --> 22:43.984
Now, Betty here will pour
some into Garner's drink

22:43.986 --> 22:45.585
and get him to reveal the name

22:45.587 --> 22:47.753
of the senator he is working for.

22:47.755 --> 22:49.488
So who came up with this experiment?

22:51.092 --> 22:54.960
What a lovely voice. Have
we ever had the pleasure?

22:54.962 --> 22:56.261
She can hear us?

22:56.263 --> 22:58.597
Agent Banks, please
explain to your friends

22:58.599 --> 22:59.965
that the Mic works both ways

22:59.967 --> 23:02.467
before they say something
they'll regret later.

23:02.469 --> 23:04.903
Unless you need me to
follow more orders, sir.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.905
I'm very good at following orders.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.240
Look, if you don't
want them to hear you,

23:08.242 --> 23:11.143
press this button here and
you have your own privacy.

23:11.145 --> 23:12.645
I've already filled the dose.

23:12.647 --> 23:14.346
Any last-minute instructions, gentlemen?

23:15.983 --> 23:17.249
He's on his way up.

23:17.251 --> 23:19.184
All right, just get the
name of the guy he works for

23:19.186 --> 23:20.953
as quickly as you can so
we can get out of here.

23:20.955 --> 23:22.121
Yes, sir.

23:23.958 --> 23:25.336
And I'm gonna get out of here

23:25.338 --> 23:27.855
'cause this situation is
too sensitive even for me.

23:32.499 --> 23:35.267
- Mr. Garner.
- Hello there.

23:35.269 --> 23:37.068
Mm, hi.

23:37.070 --> 23:39.037
You know, this goes against
everything I believe in.

23:39.039 --> 23:40.805
You don't have to stay
here for this part.

23:40.807 --> 23:44.108
- I understand.
- Good luck.

23:44.110 --> 23:46.545
I've got your drink all ready for you.

23:46.547 --> 23:51.049
- Such service.
- Have a seat. Relax.

23:51.051 --> 23:53.818
Mwah.

23:53.820 --> 23:55.453
- Bottoms up.
- Cheers.

23:58.592 --> 23:59.791
What am I looking at here?

23:59.793 --> 24:01.059
Visitors log from the base

24:01.061 --> 24:02.294
the night the files were stolen.

24:02.296 --> 24:04.962
Yeah, so Mimi signed in.
She's allowed on the base.

24:04.964 --> 24:07.498
Not anymore, not since
the Robertson Panel.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.934
Captain, have you any idea
how ridiculous this sounds?

24:09.936 --> 24:11.335
Faye was so convinced it was Mimi

24:11.337 --> 24:14.605
that she hid the visitors log
and didn't tell the agents.

24:14.607 --> 24:16.941
Do you realize how much
trouble she'd get herself into

24:16.943 --> 24:18.394
if she's hiding information

24:18.396 --> 24:20.078
from Air Force Special Investigations?

24:20.080 --> 24:22.446
Why would Mimi even wanna
go into the general's office?

24:22.448 --> 24:24.148
I don't know.

24:24.150 --> 24:27.351
Maybe someone told her to...
told her what to look for.

24:29.255 --> 24:30.588
And you think it was me.

24:30.590 --> 24:31.989
Well, I'm just thinking.

24:31.991 --> 24:33.725
How would she even know where to look?

24:33.727 --> 24:35.426
And more importantly,
why would she bother?

24:35.428 --> 24:36.527
She wouldn't!

24:38.297 --> 24:40.163
Okay.

24:40.165 --> 24:42.499
Well, that's why I'm here, to
ask her that question myself.

24:42.501 --> 24:45.527
Why are you already treating
her and me like we're guilty?

24:45.529 --> 24:47.032
What happened to me being
the only person in the world

24:47.034 --> 24:48.766
- that you trusted?
- Because, Doc, it occurred to me

24:48.768 --> 24:51.174
on the way over here that you've
actually done things like this before.

24:51.176 --> 24:53.610
Sneaking past security at White Forest

24:53.612 --> 24:55.045
to steal sensitive material.

24:55.047 --> 24:57.013
And that film at Roswell?

24:57.015 --> 24:58.549
It's not as if you never lied to me.

24:58.551 --> 25:01.051
What's going on?

25:01.053 --> 25:02.586
Mimi, I need to talk to you.

25:02.588 --> 25:03.908
We need to talk to you, actually.

25:05.391 --> 25:06.557
Michael.

25:06.559 --> 25:07.625
Susie.

25:07.627 --> 25:09.126
What are you doing here?

25:09.128 --> 25:11.294
I, uh...

25:11.296 --> 25:12.695
Doc!

25:12.697 --> 25:14.530
- Open the door.
- Why did you lock that?

25:14.532 --> 25:16.031
Okay, Mimi, I need
to ask you a question,

25:16.033 --> 25:17.838
and I need you to tell
me the truth right now.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.370
- Doc.
- Did you sneak into Blue Book the other day...

25:20.372 --> 25:21.427
Mimi.

25:21.429 --> 25:23.473
And steal sensitive material
from the general's office?

25:23.475 --> 25:25.742
I need to speak with you both.

25:26.778 --> 25:28.110
Open the door.

25:28.112 --> 25:30.079
Why are you here? Did Mimi call you?

25:30.081 --> 25:32.882
No, no, no one called me.
I just came because...

25:35.754 --> 25:37.320
What's wrong?

25:40.792 --> 25:44.760
I have to leave town for good.

25:44.762 --> 25:47.562
I was gonna tell you, but you were gone,

25:47.564 --> 25:49.364
and I didn't wanna
say it over the phone.

25:49.366 --> 25:51.132
Mimi, why would you
do something like that?

25:51.134 --> 25:52.834
- Why?
- To protect us.

25:52.836 --> 25:55.203
You have to tell me
everything right now.

25:57.908 --> 26:01.075
When you were out of
town on one of your cases,

26:01.077 --> 26:02.680
Evan showed up here, and he had

26:02.682 --> 26:03.978
some information that was provocative.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.147
- Provocative how?
- About Roswell.

26:07.951 --> 26:10.852
After the wreckage
was sent to New Mexico,

26:10.854 --> 26:14.756
it was flown here to Wright-Patt.

26:14.758 --> 26:16.257
I didn't give it much thought at first,

26:16.259 --> 26:17.526
but after the Robertson Panel...

26:17.528 --> 26:19.961
how they tried to destroy
your name and your career...

26:19.963 --> 26:23.131
- Oh, Mimi.
- It wasn't right, Allen.

26:23.133 --> 26:25.800
You worked so hard your whole life

26:25.802 --> 26:26.835
just to have the government

26:26.837 --> 26:29.137
discredit everything you've done?

26:29.139 --> 26:30.757
I thought if I could just make sure

26:30.759 --> 26:32.473
you were never put in
that position again...

26:32.475 --> 26:33.708
So you planned this?

26:33.710 --> 26:36.144
I thought if I could bring

26:36.146 --> 26:39.347
part of that wreckage... anything.

26:41.651 --> 26:43.117
And then I found this.

26:53.763 --> 26:55.463
It's from the general's office.

27:01.971 --> 27:03.070
Oh, my God.

27:05.675 --> 27:08.409
I know what this is.

27:08.411 --> 27:10.978
What are you talking about?
What do you mean leave?

27:14.751 --> 27:16.049
I don't know what to say.

27:18.954 --> 27:21.288
You can talk to me. It's okay.

27:21.290 --> 27:23.123
You can tell me anything.

27:26.195 --> 27:28.161
Tell me what it is.

27:32.134 --> 27:33.633
I just need you to know that...

27:33.635 --> 27:34.701
Captain!

27:36.471 --> 27:38.671
Is that it?

27:38.673 --> 27:40.140
You did... you stole it.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.247
It's best if we all go down together.

27:47.249 --> 27:48.615
- Just give me that file.
- No.

27:48.617 --> 27:49.973
We need to look at this together

27:49.975 --> 27:51.484
before we make any decision.

27:51.486 --> 27:53.686
Michael, please.

27:53.688 --> 27:56.890
Look, whatever it is, we'll
deal with it, all right?

27:56.892 --> 27:59.126
You don't worry about a thing.

28:00.861 --> 28:03.129
Doc, let me see that.

28:05.766 --> 28:07.433
Hangar 18, it exists?

28:07.435 --> 28:09.435
If what's in there is to be believed,

28:09.437 --> 28:11.770
that hangar contains absolute proof

28:11.772 --> 28:13.306
of extraterrestrial life

28:13.308 --> 28:15.674
and the generals know all about it.

28:15.676 --> 28:17.476
It means John was telling the truth.

28:17.478 --> 28:18.677
Who's John?

28:18.679 --> 28:20.612
Someone who used to work in the base.

28:20.614 --> 28:22.348
He came to us after D.C.

28:22.350 --> 28:24.550
Wanted to expose an Air Force program

28:24.552 --> 28:25.918
to reverse engineer UFOs.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.286
You should not be hearing this.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.521
Can you give us a second?

28:29.523 --> 28:30.645
Susie.

28:34.877 --> 28:36.361
This is exactly the kind of material

28:36.363 --> 28:37.929
- Garner was talking about.
- Doc, no.

28:37.931 --> 28:40.198
If we could expose this at
a congressional hearing or...

28:40.200 --> 28:41.399
We need to turn these files in.

28:41.401 --> 28:43.668
No, you need to make a choice first.

28:43.670 --> 28:45.736
Either you agree to give
this material to Garner,

28:45.738 --> 28:48.673
or you're going to have to hand
Mimi and me over to the OSI.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.455
Mimi, what was Allen talking about?

29:18.457 --> 29:20.957
Did you steal something?

29:20.959 --> 29:23.493
I did something bad...

29:23.495 --> 29:26.629
something very, very bad,

29:26.631 --> 29:30.467
and it could cost us everything.

29:30.469 --> 29:31.568
Tell me what's happening.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.103
I'm sure we could figure it out.

29:33.105 --> 29:37.073
You don't understand.
I put my family in danger.

29:37.075 --> 29:41.811
Hey, I know how you feel,

29:41.813 --> 29:44.914
but trust me when I say
there's always a way out.

29:44.916 --> 29:47.650
No, there isn't...

29:47.652 --> 29:48.885
not this time.

29:55.092 --> 29:57.326
This must be it.

29:57.328 --> 29:58.860
These are the pictures
taken by our source,

29:58.862 --> 30:00.129
which means they were meant for us.

30:00.131 --> 30:02.731
The generals got it first.

30:02.733 --> 30:04.133
It's real, Captain.

30:04.135 --> 30:06.902
Hangar 18 is real.

30:16.113 --> 30:18.780
So how long does it take
for this shit to kick in?

30:18.782 --> 30:21.083
Daniel says about 30 minutes.

30:21.085 --> 30:23.685
I think we're just about there now.

30:23.687 --> 30:26.055
I feel really weird all of a sudden.

30:26.057 --> 30:28.823
You're just relaxed.

30:28.825 --> 30:30.124
Let's play a game.

30:30.126 --> 30:32.561
20 questions... you ever played that?

30:32.563 --> 30:34.029
It's one of my favorites.

30:34.031 --> 30:36.264
Questions...

30:36.266 --> 30:38.667
I have so many questions now.

30:40.871 --> 30:42.938
I'll go first.

30:42.940 --> 30:44.005
Who do you work for?

30:45.609 --> 30:47.042
Something's happening to me.

30:47.044 --> 30:51.913
It's like suddenly
everything's connected.

30:51.915 --> 30:54.015
We're not alone.

30:54.017 --> 30:55.817
Of course we are.

30:55.819 --> 30:57.852
It's just us in here.

30:57.854 --> 30:58.987
No, it's not.

30:58.989 --> 31:02.356
- God is here.
- Okay, now you're scaring me.

31:02.358 --> 31:04.793
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:04.795 --> 31:06.061
Don't be scared.

31:06.063 --> 31:08.830
I'm gonna show you how you
can meet him right now.

31:08.832 --> 31:10.431
No, no, no, no, no, no. Let go of me.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.566
- Let go of me!
- No, you understand.

31:11.568 --> 31:12.800
- Shit.
- Hey, we need help in here!

31:12.802 --> 31:13.968
We can't be exposed here.

31:13.970 --> 31:15.850
- We don't have a choice.
- Please let go of me!

31:16.973 --> 31:18.072
- Hey!
- God.

31:18.074 --> 31:19.574
Let her go.

31:19.576 --> 31:21.775
- It was way too big of a dose.
- You okay?

31:21.777 --> 31:22.876
Mm-hmm.

31:25.315 --> 31:28.734
Andrew, I need you to listen to me.

31:30.253 --> 31:32.213
We need to know who it is
that you're working for.

31:35.891 --> 31:36.957
It's you.

31:36.959 --> 31:39.893
Andrew, who are you working for?

31:39.895 --> 31:41.329
He has a message for you,

31:41.331 --> 31:43.288
but you have to be ready to hear it.

31:45.700 --> 31:47.358
Are you ready to hear from God?

31:50.071 --> 31:52.639
I think you are. I think you are.

31:53.742 --> 31:56.333
So if Garner is true to his word,

31:56.335 --> 31:58.711
all we have to do is confirm
that Hangar 18 exists.

31:58.713 --> 32:00.046
Tell me it's not worth a look.

32:00.048 --> 32:03.316
Doc, look, we gave up
that ghost six months ago.

32:03.318 --> 32:04.817
There's no logs of civilian employees

32:04.819 --> 32:06.219
that matched his description.

32:06.221 --> 32:08.622
There's no suspicious buildings
with a bunker six floors below.

32:08.624 --> 32:10.143
You think the Air Force
is gonna have records

32:10.145 --> 32:12.025
that we can just access?
It's a cover-up, remember?

32:12.027 --> 32:13.826
Yeah, well, maybe it never
existed in the first place.

32:13.828 --> 32:16.029
Or maybe we didn't try
hard enough the first time.

32:18.499 --> 32:20.566
I know she's here. I want her.

32:20.568 --> 32:21.968
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, mister.

32:21.970 --> 32:23.035
You have the wrong house.

32:23.037 --> 32:25.004
- She's here.
- Who you lookin' for?

32:25.006 --> 32:26.488
- Allen, I...
- Mimi, stay in the bedroom.

32:26.490 --> 32:28.808
No, come here.

32:28.810 --> 32:31.044
- Come here, or I shoot him.
- No, no.

32:31.046 --> 32:32.344
Get down there.

32:32.346 --> 32:34.681
Just take it easy with that.
What do you want?

32:34.683 --> 32:36.182
Susie?

32:36.184 --> 32:38.885
- We don't know who that is.
- Is that so?

32:38.887 --> 32:41.253
She been giving you another name?

32:41.255 --> 32:43.923
- Her real name?
- Who the hell are you?

32:45.727 --> 32:47.927
Where is she?

32:49.397 --> 32:50.563
Over here.

32:53.967 --> 32:55.466
Call the police... now.

32:55.468 --> 32:57.202
Go, go, call.

33:01.641 --> 33:03.308
There's been a break-in. He's been shot.

33:03.310 --> 33:05.643
You've been compromised,
and you can't go home.

33:05.645 --> 33:07.671
- Susie, stay back.
- She won't.

33:07.673 --> 33:10.061
She's trained to finish the job.

33:13.687 --> 33:14.786
_

33:14.788 --> 33:16.188
We don't speak Russian.

33:16.190 --> 33:18.123
She understands.

33:18.125 --> 33:19.224
_

33:29.035 --> 33:30.324
He was talking to you.

33:33.072 --> 33:34.605
And you understand him.

33:36.042 --> 33:37.608
Oh, my God.

33:41.214 --> 33:44.215
Who are you... really?

33:46.585 --> 33:50.988
That bug in our phone,
you put that there.

33:52.158 --> 33:55.760
You've been lying to all
of us this whole time.

33:57.930 --> 33:59.229
What was he saying to you?

34:01.867 --> 34:03.066
What did he tell you?

34:05.036 --> 34:07.003
He said, "Tell them who you really are".

34:09.241 --> 34:10.774
You work for the Russians.

34:13.312 --> 34:14.777
You've been spying on me...

34:17.047 --> 34:18.081
My family.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.652
That first time we met...

34:22.655 --> 34:24.255
I had been planning that for weeks, yes.

34:33.030 --> 34:35.797
You understand how valuable I am, right?

34:37.467 --> 34:39.201
- Captain...
- Doc, just a second.

34:39.203 --> 34:40.803
The police are coming.

34:40.804 --> 34:44.206
Michael, no one else
has to know about us...

34:44.208 --> 34:46.975
not if you turn me in
and do exactly as I say.

34:46.976 --> 34:48.043
I can protect you.

34:48.045 --> 34:49.178
In the middle of an OSI investigation?

34:49.179 --> 34:51.524
- With stolen files?
- I'll say it was all me.

34:53.050 --> 34:55.248
I shot him. I stole the files.

34:55.251 --> 34:57.320
- I will take the blame for everything.
- No, no, no, no, no,

34:57.322 --> 34:58.722
I'll still be accused of colluding.

35:02.293 --> 35:05.060
My career, everything...

35:07.364 --> 35:08.496
Over.

35:08.498 --> 35:10.198
- Captain.
- You have my word.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.700
Your word?

35:14.170 --> 35:15.937
How am I supposed to trust you now?

35:15.939 --> 35:17.739
What other choice do you have?

35:17.741 --> 35:19.040
Captain, the police are here.

35:23.112 --> 35:24.713
I'm sorry.

35:26.683 --> 35:28.516
Police.

35:28.518 --> 35:31.052
Police! Open up!

35:31.054 --> 35:33.019
Let 'em in.

35:37.861 --> 35:38.893
This way.

35:41.720 --> 35:42.730
Miss.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.050
Well, we appreciate

35:53.052 --> 35:54.685
all your help. Thank you.

36:13.606 --> 36:16.973
You okay? You need a break?

36:16.975 --> 36:19.576
No, no, I'm fine.

36:21.780 --> 36:22.812
Doc.

36:28.820 --> 36:29.853
How you doin'?

36:29.855 --> 36:33.556
Honestly... I'm not so sure.

36:33.558 --> 36:36.459
We're about done here.
I gotta get back to the base.

36:36.461 --> 36:40.797
- But I need that file.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

36:49.741 --> 36:52.108
Just so we're clear, Susie's
the one who took this.

36:52.110 --> 36:53.809
That's what we're all saying, yes.

36:53.811 --> 36:55.778
- Good.
- What about Faye?

36:55.780 --> 36:57.846
She never knew anything for sure.

36:57.848 --> 37:00.316
I'll just tell her
our version of events.

37:00.318 --> 37:01.583
Okay.

37:07.558 --> 37:09.191
We'll get through this, Doc.

37:09.193 --> 37:11.860
Long as we're all together.

37:24.907 --> 37:28.765
- All there?
- Yeah, as far as I can tell.

37:28.767 --> 37:31.814
I'm sure she photographed
the whole goddamn thing.

37:31.816 --> 37:33.014
Mm.

37:34.072 --> 37:37.118
Well, if the Soviets wanted
to know about our program,

37:37.120 --> 37:40.856
they sure as shit will
get a good look at it now.

37:40.858 --> 37:45.226
You know, your instincts
about Susie were spot-on.

37:45.228 --> 37:48.129
But Quinn... what are
we gonna do about that?

37:48.131 --> 37:50.131
Well, if you're asking
me if he was a traitor,

37:50.133 --> 37:51.567
I'd be inclined to say no,

37:51.569 --> 37:53.669
but he sure as hell was sloppy.

37:53.671 --> 37:57.105
We'll get to the bottom of
how much in the coming days.

38:01.144 --> 38:03.244
- Go home, Jim.
- Mm.

38:03.246 --> 38:05.781
Get some rest.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.482
This is far from over.

38:13.923 --> 38:15.189
Project Blue Book.

38:15.191 --> 38:17.592
Professor, this is
Senator John F. Kennedy.

38:17.594 --> 38:19.426
How are you today?

38:19.428 --> 38:23.535
Senator Kennedy, hello. I'm fine, sir.

38:23.537 --> 38:25.326
Thank you. How are you?

38:25.328 --> 38:28.268
- Is Captain Quinn with you?
- Yes, sir, right here.

38:28.270 --> 38:31.071
Captain, I've been eager
to introduce myself,

38:31.073 --> 38:34.141
given the great work your
program has been doing.

38:34.143 --> 38:35.710
Why, thank you, Senator.

38:35.712 --> 38:39.045
D.C. especially could
have been disastrous.

38:39.047 --> 38:41.214
What were those lights again, Doctor?

38:41.216 --> 38:43.282
Temperature inversions.

38:43.284 --> 38:44.784
Temperature inversions, yes.

38:44.786 --> 38:47.954
And that's what you saw up
there in that plane, Captain.

38:47.956 --> 38:49.589
Yes, sir.

38:49.591 --> 38:53.693
So... now both of you are lying to me.

38:57.465 --> 38:58.832
I'm not sure if you were aware,

38:58.834 --> 39:03.039
but Secretary Fairchild
was a friend of mine.

39:03.939 --> 39:07.240
Considered me a protégé
of sorts, actually,

39:07.242 --> 39:10.243
so he shared a lot of secrets with me...

39:11.847 --> 39:12.979
Including...

39:14.882 --> 39:16.782
On his last night in D.C.

39:16.784 --> 39:18.117
He told you about the film?

39:18.119 --> 39:20.219
That's right.

39:23.770 --> 39:25.092
What else did he say?

39:25.094 --> 39:27.393
That he trusted you and he
believed in the sightings,

39:27.395 --> 39:28.961
as I'm guessing you do as well.

39:28.963 --> 39:30.896
Well, Captain Quinn and I, we believe

39:30.898 --> 39:32.998
that until we have real answers,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.801
science and observation
are the best way forward.

39:37.672 --> 39:40.440
I couldn't agree more.
Gentlemen, thank you.

39:40.442 --> 39:42.675
Hopefully we'll be in touch before long.

39:42.677 --> 39:44.357
- Thank you, Senator.
- Thank you, Senator.

39:49.316 --> 39:50.583
What do you make of that?

39:52.019 --> 39:55.087
I wonder if we just found
out who Garner's working for.

39:57.792 --> 39:59.592
- Mail's here.
- Thank you, Faye.

40:01.963 --> 40:05.698
So let's say Garner
is working for Kennedy.

40:05.700 --> 40:08.934
Where is Kennedy getting
his information from?

40:08.936 --> 40:12.037
And I wonder how much more
he knows that we don't.

40:19.113 --> 40:20.345
What's that?

40:20.347 --> 40:23.515
"Blue Book, this is John.

40:23.517 --> 40:25.984
It's been six months,
but I managed to get you

40:25.986 --> 40:27.452
the proof that you were looking for".

40:27.454 --> 40:29.421
John... Hangar 18?

40:29.423 --> 40:32.190
Officially... I don't exist.

40:33.827 --> 40:35.927
I thought the generals got to him.

40:35.929 --> 40:37.028
Apparently not.

40:37.030 --> 40:39.472
"Use this key to see for yourselves".

40:42.269 --> 40:43.835
Come in.

40:50.277 --> 40:51.343
Have a seat.

40:54.414 --> 40:56.681
You have fun last night?

40:56.683 --> 40:59.083
Nope, but I did learn a few things.

41:00.353 --> 41:03.054
Oh, yeah? What's that?

41:03.056 --> 41:05.189
Sometimes the information
that you're looking for

41:05.191 --> 41:07.992
comes from the most unexpected place.

41:16.369 --> 41:18.269
So how did it go with Garner?

41:18.271 --> 41:19.537
We got our name.

41:19.539 --> 41:21.105
I don't know if we can
do anything with it yet.

41:21.107 --> 41:22.874
He's a bit untouchable.

41:23.933 --> 41:27.679
When it comes to the
CIA, no one's untouchable.

41:37.623 --> 41:38.722
Did you bring it?

41:40.526 --> 41:41.615
I did.

41:54.873 --> 41:57.408
Yeah, what got you so interested

41:57.410 --> 41:59.476
in taking a trip, General?

41:59.478 --> 42:02.213
You just seem to strike me
as a pretty straitlaced guy.

42:04.349 --> 42:06.190
Let's just say I've been struggling

42:06.192 --> 42:08.418
with my faith lately,
and I've been hoping

42:08.420 --> 42:10.453
to find someone who
could explain a few things

42:10.455 --> 42:12.755
that have been on my mind.

42:32.410 --> 42:34.076
They've cleaned house.

42:34.078 --> 42:36.278
Wondering if there was ever
anything here to begin with.

42:47.958 --> 42:49.358
Maybe the generals set us up...

42:51.462 --> 42:52.527
To see what we'd do.

42:55.199 --> 42:56.231
If that's the case,

42:56.233 --> 42:57.553
we've never been in more trouble.

43:01.538 --> 43:02.937
So what's our next move?

43:04.408 --> 43:06.007
I don't know, Doc.

43:06.009 --> 43:07.376
Really don't know.

43:09.913 --> 43:12.413
Three, one, five, four, five,

43:12.415 --> 43:16.017
six, five, three, nine.
