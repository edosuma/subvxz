00:02.416 --> 00:04.952
...Did you check out the
theme for the dance?

00:05.670 --> 00:07.304
"Starry, Starry Night."

00:07.630 --> 00:08.899
Lame or what?

00:08.923 --> 00:10.641
Definitely the lamest.

00:11.968 --> 00:14.520
Oh, my God, I forgot
it was the yearbook.

00:14.554 --> 00:16.397
You like this color?

00:16.556 --> 00:17.857
I've got an idea.

00:19.183 --> 00:21.578
Excuse me. Is anyone in here?

00:21.602 --> 00:24.071
Um, I have an emergency.

00:26.148 --> 00:27.616
It's a girl thing.

00:33.072 --> 00:34.540
What's that little disk thing?

00:35.616 --> 00:36.677
I don't know.

00:36.701 --> 00:38.262
Maybe a deodorizer or something?

00:38.286 --> 00:39.513
Hmm.

00:39.537 --> 00:41.714
You think they're supposed
to hit it or avoid it?

00:41.831 --> 00:44.466
Beats me.

00:45.501 --> 00:46.886
So, what am I going to wear?

00:47.003 --> 00:48.220
To what?

00:48.713 --> 00:50.857
Hello, the dance.

00:50.881 --> 00:53.225
You just said how lame
it was going to be.

00:53.884 --> 00:55.237
Yeah, well,

00:55.261 --> 00:57.313
Michael Cassutt
kind of begged me.

00:58.264 --> 00:59.690
You're not going to go?

00:59.891 --> 01:02.202
No. No one asked me.

01:02.226 --> 01:03.944
Well, you're probably lucky.

01:04.477 --> 01:06.238
I don't think I'm
gonna stay very long.

01:06.355 --> 01:07.916
Oh, this is so gross.

01:07.940 --> 01:11.003
"Girls with the best legs.
Best butts."

01:11.027 --> 01:12.588
Oh, you're kidding.

01:12.612 --> 01:14.256
Look, you're here.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.300
"Girls we most want
to sleep with."

01:16.324 --> 01:17.384
Number two.

01:17.408 --> 01:18.792
Excuse me?

01:19.577 --> 01:21.013
Who's number one?

01:21.037 --> 01:22.880
Regina Lester.

01:22.914 --> 01:25.174
Oh, figures. Slut.

01:26.125 --> 01:27.301
Where are you?

01:27.668 --> 01:29.637
I'm not on it.

01:29.670 --> 01:31.555
Well, you've got to
be here somewhere.

01:31.672 --> 01:34.026
I'm not. Let's go.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.392
Oh, there you are!

01:35.551 --> 01:36.685
Where?

01:38.095 --> 01:40.314
"Girls we most want
to cheat off of."

01:42.933 --> 01:44.360
Guys are stupid.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.280 --> 01:57.998
- Trash cans?
- They're full.

01:58.574 --> 02:00.084
Put it outside.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.255
Just what I want to do right now.
Housework.

02:04.372 --> 02:06.215
Why did you have to
say yes, Charlie?

02:06.540 --> 02:08.175
What was I supposed to say?

02:08.584 --> 02:09.978
One of Mom and Dad's
best friends.

02:10.002 --> 02:11.939
She hasn't seen us
in three years.

02:11.963 --> 02:13.440
She wanted to check in.

02:13.464 --> 02:15.975
Great, exactly what
I'm in the mood for.

02:16.217 --> 02:17.434
A house-guest.

02:17.551 --> 02:19.186
Where is she gonna sleep?

02:20.304 --> 02:21.365
- Charlie's room.
- Charlie's room.

02:21.389 --> 02:23.033
Fine. I'll sleep on the couch.

02:23.057 --> 02:25.067
Serves you right after what
happened with Kirsten.

02:25.601 --> 02:28.205
Hey, I'm interviewing a nanny
today, okay, so lay off.

02:28.229 --> 02:31.282
Jeez, why is
everybody so crabby?

02:31.399 --> 02:32.376
Kirsten.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.575
Kate.

02:35.695 --> 02:37.121
Mind your own business.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.790
Greer...

02:40.366 --> 02:42.793
I can't really remember
what she looked like.

02:43.035 --> 02:44.461
She's kind of pretty.

02:45.079 --> 02:47.724
She was the one who sent that
gigantic wreath after the funeral.

02:47.748 --> 02:49.476
The one with the dried
fruits of the world on it.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.770
Yeah, the one we had to saw in half
to get through the front door.

02:51.794 --> 02:54.513
She babysat me once and let
me dye my hair burgundy.

02:55.548 --> 02:57.016
She sounds like fun.

02:57.508 --> 03:00.320
Yeah, just what we're
in the mood for...

03:00.344 --> 03:01.520
- Fun.
- Fun.

03:51.270 --> 03:54.374
I'm fascinated by the way
kids develop and change.

03:54.398 --> 03:55.866
They're so inventive.

03:56.317 --> 03:59.370
I'm committed to child care for
the next five or so years.

03:59.987 --> 04:01.163
And after that?

04:01.322 --> 04:02.674
Well, I know it
sounds kind of dumb,

04:02.698 --> 04:04.885
but eventually, I'd
like to be an artist.

04:04.909 --> 04:07.086
Oh. What do you paint?

04:07.203 --> 04:09.431
It's sort of performance art.

04:09.455 --> 04:10.798
I paint myself.

04:10.956 --> 04:12.091
My body.

04:15.586 --> 04:17.606
Heather, uh, you know...

04:17.630 --> 04:22.226
Um, Owen's allergic to...
To paint,

04:22.384 --> 04:25.562
so, I'm afraid this isn't
going to work out.

04:26.514 --> 04:28.524
Right this way.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.443
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:32.103 --> 04:33.529
What's the occasion?

04:33.813 --> 04:37.125
Well, Wednesday, Isaac
tries out new dishes,

04:37.149 --> 04:40.796
and today is his Italian
day, and he's making penne.

04:40.820 --> 04:43.924
And since I know you love Italian
food so much, I thought,

04:43.948 --> 04:45.707
"Hey, I should tell
Ross about this."

04:45.783 --> 04:48.762
Well, I'm really not all that
crazy about Italian, but...

04:48.786 --> 04:51.630
Oh, well, it's not too Italian.
It's...

04:52.081 --> 04:53.841
Kind of, um...

04:55.543 --> 04:57.354
Italian-Caribbean.

04:57.378 --> 04:58.554
Yeah.

04:58.587 --> 05:00.597
Mostly Caribbean.

05:00.714 --> 05:02.109
Hello.

05:02.133 --> 05:05.477
Uh, today's special
is chicken Santa Fe.

05:05.594 --> 05:06.822
Penne.

05:06.846 --> 05:08.230
And penne.

05:08.889 --> 05:10.826
Jeannie, this is Ross.

05:10.850 --> 05:12.452
He's my violin teacher.

05:12.476 --> 05:13.870
Ross, this is Jeannie.

05:13.894 --> 05:15.038
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:15.062 --> 05:16.530
She loves violin music.

05:16.897 --> 05:19.533
You do? Like what?

05:19.942 --> 05:21.535
I like...

05:22.069 --> 05:24.204
Well, you know, the usual.

05:24.446 --> 05:29.001
Hey, we were just listening to Bruch's
concerto in G minor the other day.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.627
Oh, right.

05:33.247 --> 05:35.299
I have to, uh...

05:36.584 --> 05:38.135
Make a phone call.

05:39.795 --> 05:42.306
Um... Would you like a drink?

05:43.632 --> 05:46.727
Now, this is what I
call a challenge.

05:47.011 --> 05:48.478
Anchovies...

05:49.430 --> 05:50.574
Capers...

05:50.598 --> 05:52.399
Ooh, sun-dried tomatoes?

05:54.018 --> 05:55.319
One of Thurber's chew toys.

05:55.561 --> 05:58.197
That won't work. Too rubbery.
Okay...

05:59.023 --> 06:00.750
You don't have to make
us dinner, Greer.

06:00.774 --> 06:01.793
You just got here. Really.

06:01.817 --> 06:03.503
Yeah, we can go out.
It's no problem.

06:03.527 --> 06:04.504
Hey, listen,

06:04.528 --> 06:06.006
if I can't whip
up a great dinner

06:06.030 --> 06:08.332
out of a few stray
ingredients, ooh...

06:09.158 --> 06:12.053
My latest cookbook isn't worth
the paper it's printed on.

06:12.077 --> 06:15.181
<i>Something out of Nothing: What to
Cook when the Cupboard is Bare.</i>

06:15.205 --> 06:16.349
What do you think?

06:16.373 --> 06:18.759
- I'd buy it.
- Pasta?

06:19.168 --> 06:21.646
Remind me to pick you
guys up a set of galleys

06:21.670 --> 06:23.722
when I go to my
publisher's tomorrow.

06:24.173 --> 06:26.735
Greer, you sure you don't want me to take
your bags upstairs, get you settled in?

06:26.759 --> 06:28.778
Oh, Bailey, I have
days to settle in,

06:28.802 --> 06:31.688
and who knows when I'll have all
of you in the same room again?

06:32.014 --> 06:34.942
I want to hear about
everything that's going on.

06:35.059 --> 06:39.372
Well, Bailey's in the 11th grade
now, and Julia's in 10th...

06:39.396 --> 06:42.199
Who cares about school? I want
to know about your sex lives.

06:42.566 --> 06:45.535
You haven't gone and fallen in
love with a sailor, have you?

06:45.611 --> 06:47.496
- Not lately.
- Oh, phew.

06:47.571 --> 06:48.747
Ooh.

06:48.822 --> 06:51.760
Julia, how about you? Any gossip?
Intrigue?

06:51.784 --> 06:53.252
Not in my life.

06:53.535 --> 06:55.972
Charlie cheated on this terrific
nanny we had, so she split.

06:55.996 --> 06:58.215
- That was kind of sordid.
- Julia!

06:58.415 --> 07:00.518
How about you, Bailey? Are
you in love with anyone?

07:00.542 --> 07:02.719
- Danger, danger.
- Shut up.

07:03.754 --> 07:07.182
I was seeing someone, but...
Now it's over.

07:08.175 --> 07:12.187
Boy, well, it may take more than a
bowl of pasta to cheer you guys up,

07:12.471 --> 07:13.897
but we'll start there.

07:14.431 --> 07:15.909
I say...

07:15.933 --> 07:17.693
We eat alfresco.

07:19.061 --> 07:20.362
Who's he?

07:21.605 --> 07:23.917
- It was good.
- Oh, God, I'm so full.

07:23.941 --> 07:26.493
Oh, good. That was the idea.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.883
Hey, Jule, you're gonna help me
out with these dishes, right?

07:31.907 --> 07:32.926
I did them last night.

07:32.950 --> 07:35.168
I'll do them as
long as I can wash.

07:35.202 --> 07:38.255
Old enough to fall in love,
but too young to drink.

07:40.666 --> 07:43.260
Actually, I've... I've got a
pretty good routine going. I...

07:43.752 --> 07:47.222
I put on depressing music, I lie in
bed, and I stare at the ceiling.

07:50.759 --> 07:52.436
So why did it end?

07:55.931 --> 07:57.566
She...

07:59.226 --> 08:01.121
She wants to wait
till she's married.

08:01.145 --> 08:02.205
To...

08:02.229 --> 08:03.530
Oh, I get it.

08:04.982 --> 08:07.159
I don't even know if I believe it.
I mean,

08:07.609 --> 08:10.579
if she felt the same way about
me that I feel about her...

08:11.447 --> 08:13.665
It's not like I'm a sex
fiend or anything.

08:16.577 --> 08:17.762
My friend, Will,

08:17.786 --> 08:19.421
is trying to get me
to go to this dance

08:19.663 --> 08:21.182
this weekend, you know,
meet someone new.

08:21.206 --> 08:23.643
The thing is, I don't
want to meet anyone else.

08:23.667 --> 08:25.761
Oh, yes, you do. Sure you do.

08:25.961 --> 08:28.189
There is someone else out
there for you, Bailey.

08:28.213 --> 08:30.349
Yeah, maybe in space.

08:30.466 --> 08:31.850
Not on this planet.

08:33.927 --> 08:36.730
Look, I'm going to
be here for a week.

08:36.847 --> 08:39.659
- Why don't you let me set you up?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:39.683 --> 08:41.494
No, it's okay, really. You
don't have to do anything.

08:41.518 --> 08:42.986
Of course I do.

08:43.102 --> 08:46.698
Everybody needs a little help
from somebody at some time.

08:46.732 --> 08:49.534
Your mom introduced me
to my first husband...

08:50.319 --> 08:51.912
And my second.

08:52.321 --> 08:54.456
Oh, and look at that face.

08:55.282 --> 08:58.543
Staring up at the ceiling.
What a waste.

08:59.953 --> 09:01.296
I'm on the case.

09:10.881 --> 09:12.099
Bangs?

09:13.133 --> 09:14.851
I don't know. What do you think?

09:15.010 --> 09:19.064
I think you are starting to look
more and more like your mother.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.066
- I wish.
- You do!

09:21.100 --> 09:22.401
You have her eyes.

09:22.893 --> 09:24.454
You definitely have her mouth.

09:24.478 --> 09:26.238
I know, it's just...

09:26.688 --> 09:30.242
Put it this way. Mom would have been
invited to the stupid dance by now.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.588
Do I have to give you a list
of the spectacular women

09:33.612 --> 09:34.955
who didn't go to the prom?

09:35.030 --> 09:37.040
No. I know. It's just...

09:37.491 --> 09:39.928
Some girls make an impression,
and some don't, that's all.

09:39.952 --> 09:41.346
What are you talking about?

09:41.370 --> 09:42.847
Well, like you.

09:42.871 --> 09:45.507
I mean, every time you walk
in a room, people look up.

09:45.791 --> 09:48.218
I guess I just always
wished I could be that way.

09:48.710 --> 09:50.637
You know, someone who's noticed.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.057
I am sure you're noticed.

09:54.716 --> 09:56.694
Yeah, for being on
the honor roll.

09:56.718 --> 09:59.479
What a thrill. I'm not
even doing well anymore.

09:59.638 --> 10:01.074
You know, I spend
all this energy

10:01.098 --> 10:03.525
trying to change who I
am and what I do, and...

10:03.767 --> 10:06.611
Still, that's all I'm
known for, a brain.

10:07.438 --> 10:08.947
I'm not...

10:09.815 --> 10:13.326
I don't know, I just... I'm
not special, you know?

10:13.986 --> 10:15.370
Julia,

10:16.155 --> 10:17.873
how can you say that?

10:18.490 --> 10:21.501
Listen, when I saw
you today, honestly,

10:21.618 --> 10:25.088
my first reaction was, "My
God, she's become a knockout!"

10:25.372 --> 10:27.767
Sure, a knockout, that's me.

10:27.791 --> 10:29.926
Don't tell me no one's
told you that before.

10:30.502 --> 10:32.012
Why would they?

10:32.087 --> 10:33.513
Julia...

10:34.631 --> 10:36.141
Look at yourself.

10:38.260 --> 10:39.644
Why wouldn't they?

10:53.817 --> 10:55.410
Claudia.

10:56.028 --> 10:58.330
You, uh, forgot your music.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.582
I was gonna pick it
up at my lesson.

11:00.741 --> 11:02.709
Well, I was in the
neighborhood, so I...

11:02.951 --> 11:06.004
So... How was Jeannie?

11:07.164 --> 11:08.840
Uh, she was very nice.

11:09.875 --> 11:11.718
She's kind of cute,
don't you think?

11:11.793 --> 11:13.887
She loves horseback riding.

11:14.087 --> 11:16.389
Maybe that's what you guys
could do on your next date.

11:17.841 --> 11:19.184
Claudia, come here.

11:27.601 --> 11:32.531
Uh... Jeannie and I aren't
going to go out again.

11:32.940 --> 11:34.157
Why not?

11:37.194 --> 11:38.662
Because I'm gay.

11:44.117 --> 11:46.304
Maybe I should have told you earlier.
I just...

11:46.328 --> 11:47.587
No.

11:49.331 --> 11:50.549
It's okay.

11:51.792 --> 11:53.301
Well, why should you?

11:53.669 --> 11:55.053
You want to talk about it?

11:56.255 --> 11:58.056
What's to talk about?

11:59.132 --> 12:01.142
So you're gay.

12:01.969 --> 12:03.186
No big deal.

12:14.564 --> 12:16.074
Ew, gross.

12:16.733 --> 12:18.618
- What is it?
- It's wax.

12:18.944 --> 12:21.538
When it dries, you rip it off
and the hair comes off with it.

12:22.489 --> 12:24.124
You're doing this on your own?

12:24.533 --> 12:25.927
I mean, no one's making you?

12:25.951 --> 12:27.553
Well, it doesn't
leave any stubble,

12:27.577 --> 12:29.671
so it's better than
shaving for pictures.

12:30.163 --> 12:31.631
What pictures?

12:32.332 --> 12:33.851
Greer thinks I should
have my pictures taken

12:33.875 --> 12:36.354
by a friend of hers, a
fashion photographer.

12:36.378 --> 12:39.389
He's really well-known. He's
discovered a lot of famous models.

12:39.589 --> 12:41.308
Why would he take your picture?

12:42.134 --> 12:45.478
Well, Greer kind of thinks
maybe I could be a model.

12:46.179 --> 12:48.648
Hmm, don't you have to be
beautiful to be a model?

12:52.311 --> 12:54.112
Yeah, I guess it is
kind of stupid, huh?

12:54.771 --> 12:56.448
Maybe I should just forget it.

12:57.482 --> 12:59.159
Can I do it? Can I rip it off?

12:59.318 --> 13:01.161
No. Get out.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.623
Oh, if it hurts,

13:04.948 --> 13:07.125
scream loud. I want to hear.

13:08.660 --> 13:09.961
Cynda Bergen.

13:10.454 --> 13:11.389
Who?

13:11.413 --> 13:14.215
Cynda Bergen. Don't tell
me you don't remember her.

13:14.291 --> 13:16.769
Her father owned that
incredible Viennese bakery

13:16.793 --> 13:18.720
next to your dad's place?

13:19.129 --> 13:20.440
Well, the two of you
used to play together

13:20.464 --> 13:22.150
for hours in the kitchen
when you were little.

13:22.174 --> 13:25.477
She was crazy about you,
and apparently, still is.

13:25.844 --> 13:27.530
I'm not saying she
wasn't qualified.

13:27.554 --> 13:29.490
She is? How do you know?

13:29.514 --> 13:31.483
Eclairs, for later.

13:31.725 --> 13:34.194
Her father tells me
she's unattached,

13:34.394 --> 13:36.363
and she talks about
you all the time.

13:36.646 --> 13:37.832
I find that a little
hard to believe.

13:37.856 --> 13:39.500
No, I don't think I'm
being unreasonable.

13:39.524 --> 13:42.202
I was just hoping you could send
over someone who wasn't quite so...

13:42.736 --> 13:44.172
Well, so young.

13:44.196 --> 13:46.039
Her dad showed me
a picture, Bay.

13:46.948 --> 13:48.583
I just think a more...

13:49.117 --> 13:51.211
Mature nanny would
be better for me.

13:51.536 --> 13:53.806
I mean, for us, for Owen.

13:53.830 --> 13:56.341
And if it works out, you could
take her to that dance.

13:57.626 --> 13:59.854
I don't know, Greer. I don't
think I'm ready to date yet.

13:59.878 --> 14:02.106
Oh, you'll never know
if you don't try.

14:02.130 --> 14:04.891
I mean, come on, what is the
worst thing that could happen?

14:06.760 --> 14:10.647
So, you got a good drama
club over there at Grant?

14:11.723 --> 14:12.784
I guess.

14:12.808 --> 14:15.777
I don't know. I'm not really
into drama stuff, so...

14:16.520 --> 14:17.737
Oh.

14:18.188 --> 14:19.823
Well, theater's my life.

14:21.066 --> 14:23.034
We're doing <i>Taming of
the Shrew</i> this year.

14:23.402 --> 14:24.703
Uh-huh.

14:24.945 --> 14:26.454
Yeah, I'm playing Kate.

14:26.947 --> 14:28.498
Kate? Really?

14:29.074 --> 14:30.458
The shrew.

14:31.868 --> 14:32.845
Oh.

14:32.869 --> 14:35.171
Well, that's...
That's good for you.

14:45.590 --> 14:47.434
I have a cousin named Barney.

14:49.136 --> 14:50.311
Uh-huh?

14:50.470 --> 14:52.115
Yeah, we call him
Barn sometimes.

14:52.139 --> 14:53.940
Does anyone ever call you Barn?

14:55.392 --> 14:56.609
No.

14:57.811 --> 14:59.654
Because my name is Bailey.

15:00.689 --> 15:02.198
- It is?
- Mmm-hmm.

15:03.066 --> 15:04.284
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:07.821 --> 15:11.750
This... This girl I was seeing,
she'd call me Barley sometimes.

15:15.704 --> 15:17.047
I don't get it.

15:24.212 --> 15:25.398
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:25.422 --> 15:27.108
- I'm Julia Salinger.
- Uh-huh.

15:27.132 --> 15:28.433
Greer's friend?

15:29.009 --> 15:30.403
Uh, Greer Erikson.

15:30.427 --> 15:32.363
Oh, oh, sure, of course, yeah.

15:32.387 --> 15:33.573
She's great, isn't she?

15:33.597 --> 15:35.283
- Yeah, she's real cool.
- Yeah.

15:35.307 --> 15:36.816
- Here, have a seat.
- Thanks.

15:37.142 --> 15:39.861
So, what are we doing? We...

15:40.145 --> 15:41.456
Filling out that portfolio?

15:41.480 --> 15:45.158
What? Oh, no, I've never
done this before.

15:45.317 --> 15:46.502
You're kidding?

15:46.526 --> 15:47.587
That a problem?

15:47.611 --> 15:49.245
No, no, no, no. I...

15:49.321 --> 15:50.997
I just figured you'd modeled.

15:51.490 --> 15:53.166
You have an incredible face.

15:53.408 --> 15:55.210
- Really?
- Trust me.

15:55.285 --> 15:57.764
I look at faces all day, and...

15:57.788 --> 15:59.130
You're fantastic.

16:02.209 --> 16:03.478
Okay.

16:03.502 --> 16:05.011
When should we do this?

16:05.462 --> 16:07.639
Um, any afternoon's good for me.

16:08.799 --> 16:11.226
Afternoons...

16:11.426 --> 16:13.853
You know, I'm going to need
that 800 bucks upfront.

16:15.931 --> 16:18.149
- 800?
- I know it's steep,

16:18.391 --> 16:20.401
but it's the going rate.

16:21.144 --> 16:22.654
You can ask around.

16:23.605 --> 16:26.324
No, that's okay. If you're
a friend of Greer's...

16:26.525 --> 16:27.784
I trust you.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.245
Okay, afternoons.

16:41.748 --> 16:43.049
Keep it up a little bit.

16:46.378 --> 16:47.679
Elbow in.

16:55.929 --> 16:57.939
Okay, let's work on...

17:03.144 --> 17:04.487
What's the matter?

17:05.605 --> 17:07.031
Nothing.

17:11.152 --> 17:12.453
Really.

17:13.195 --> 17:16.425
So after two hours, she still
thought your name was Barney?

17:16.449 --> 17:17.801
And that was the good
part of the date.

17:17.826 --> 17:19.544
Oh, God.

17:21.829 --> 17:23.631
What are we going
to do about you?

17:27.127 --> 17:28.303
You know something?

17:28.670 --> 17:32.733
You remind me so much of this guy
I fell in love with in college.

17:32.757 --> 17:34.267
His name was Sam,

17:34.718 --> 17:39.606
and he played the clarinet,
hockey, and tournament chess.

17:41.182 --> 17:43.109
Yeah, that sounds just like me.

17:45.145 --> 17:47.488
The thing I loved
the most about him

17:47.606 --> 17:50.408
was that he had no idea
how terrific he was.

17:51.484 --> 17:54.537
I remember, the first
few times I kissed him,

17:54.905 --> 17:58.259
he'd get this look on his face
as if he couldn't believe

17:58.283 --> 18:01.294
that any woman would think
he was that wonderful.

18:11.588 --> 18:13.514
Good night. I'm going to bed.

18:21.598 --> 18:24.025
Jule, what's the
deal with this...

18:25.518 --> 18:28.404
Whoa. Did I miss an earthquake?

18:28.480 --> 18:30.740
We're preparing for
Julia's session.

18:31.608 --> 18:33.701
- You're what?
- She's gonna be a model.

18:35.236 --> 18:36.579
Greer set it up.

18:36.655 --> 18:38.215
She introduced me
to a photographer

18:38.239 --> 18:40.959
who said I've got a great face
and wants to take my picture.

18:41.034 --> 18:43.461
He thinks maybe I can get work, Charlie.
He's real great.

18:44.496 --> 18:46.923
This photographer's name
better not be Ed Brighton.

18:48.333 --> 18:49.602
Yeah, but...

18:49.626 --> 18:52.262
You wrote an $800 check
to a photographer?

18:52.629 --> 18:55.483
What are you, stupid? Checks
are for emergencies, Julia.

18:55.507 --> 18:56.849
I'll pay it back.

18:57.008 --> 18:58.226
How?

18:59.052 --> 19:00.895
God, what is Greer thinking?

19:01.429 --> 19:03.616
She thinks maybe I could
make money as a model.

19:03.640 --> 19:07.694
Yeah, you know, Christy
Turlington makes $25,000 a day.

19:10.188 --> 19:11.489
Look...

19:11.523 --> 19:14.242
Julia, Greer's not the greatest
financial advisor in the world.

19:14.317 --> 19:15.618
What does that mean?

19:15.777 --> 19:17.537
You remember that
wreath she sent us?

19:17.570 --> 19:19.966
Well, two weeks after the
funeral, we got billed for it.

19:19.990 --> 19:21.467
I'm sure it was just a mistake.

19:21.491 --> 19:23.928
Yeah, right. Well, I
still ended up paying.

19:23.952 --> 19:27.014
Look, it wasn't just her. Ed thought
so too. He said I was beautiful.

19:27.038 --> 19:28.298
And you bought it?

19:28.540 --> 19:32.218
For God's sake, Julia, for 800 bucks,
I'd tell you you were beautiful, too.

19:36.297 --> 19:37.640
He wasn't lying.

19:38.842 --> 19:41.060
I just can't believe you'd do
something as stupid as this.

19:53.815 --> 19:55.116
He wasn't lying.

20:05.243 --> 20:06.461
Whoa.

20:09.247 --> 20:10.590
Sorry.

20:21.134 --> 20:22.435
Can't sleep, huh?

20:27.182 --> 20:28.441
Me neither.

20:29.309 --> 20:31.402
I'm gonna leave, Bailey.

20:32.645 --> 20:33.905
You are?

20:36.107 --> 20:37.418
First thing in the morning.

20:37.442 --> 20:40.244
I made a reservation
at the Post Hotel.

20:40.653 --> 20:41.913
Why?

20:42.530 --> 20:44.207
I made a mistake.

20:44.491 --> 20:45.792
Tonight...

20:47.243 --> 20:49.587
I'm so sorry if I
embarrassed you.

20:50.330 --> 20:52.475
- You're sorry?
- I wasn't thinking.

20:52.499 --> 20:53.392
Greer...

20:53.416 --> 20:56.344
So I should go. Tell the others.

21:06.805 --> 21:08.439
Did you have a big wedding?

21:09.224 --> 21:13.027
Uh, pretty big. 100 people.

21:13.728 --> 21:15.321
Have you been married
a long time?

21:16.106 --> 21:17.782
Uh, three years.

21:18.566 --> 21:20.326
Three years.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.121
Three whole years, wow.

21:24.948 --> 21:27.083
Marriage. The big C...

21:27.784 --> 21:29.252
Commitment.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.964
It's not as easy as I
thought it would be.

21:33.331 --> 21:37.218
We're kind of looking into the
idea of an open marriage.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.526
My instinct tells me

21:43.550 --> 21:46.070
we should stay away from
high-fashion stuff with you

21:46.094 --> 21:47.812
and go more for the
girl next door.

21:47.971 --> 21:49.031
Really?

21:49.055 --> 21:53.067
You don't really have that haute
couture, <i>Vogue</i> magazine thing going.

21:53.101 --> 21:55.069
I think you're better
for catalog work.

21:55.228 --> 21:58.207
What, dressed in flannel shirts
like a lumberjack or something?

21:58.231 --> 21:59.959
Hey, given my choice,

21:59.983 --> 22:02.368
I'd take catalog work any day.

22:02.402 --> 22:05.663
It pays well, it's
run by sane people,

22:05.697 --> 22:07.800
and best of all...

22:07.824 --> 22:09.709
They don't hire supermodels.

22:09.784 --> 22:11.377
What's wrong with supermodels?

22:13.079 --> 22:16.299
How many supermodels does it
take to screw in a light bulb?

22:16.749 --> 22:17.893
I don't know.

22:17.917 --> 22:22.305
One. She just sits there, and the
whole world revolves around her.

22:25.341 --> 22:26.642
Yeah.

22:26.801 --> 22:29.270
Why does a supermodel
wear shoulder pads?

22:29.387 --> 22:30.688
Why?

22:30.847 --> 22:32.398
I don't know.

22:33.516 --> 22:36.444
Great. Okay, keep your chin down.
Good.

22:37.729 --> 22:40.364
Oh, now, just turn a
little bit to the left.

22:40.481 --> 22:42.200
Yeah, hold that right there.

22:43.026 --> 22:44.327
Great.

22:44.485 --> 22:45.745
Great.

22:46.821 --> 22:48.998
You really are beautiful,
you know that?

22:50.742 --> 22:51.918
Yeah.

22:52.035 --> 22:53.971
Okay, so it was probably
nothing, right?

22:53.995 --> 22:55.588
Doesn't sound like nothing.

22:55.663 --> 22:56.599
Really?

22:56.623 --> 22:57.850
Because it didn't
feel like nothing.

22:57.874 --> 22:59.592
It felt more like something.

22:59.667 --> 23:01.177
Then it was probably something.

23:01.377 --> 23:02.271
Well, if it was nothing,

23:02.295 --> 23:03.647
why would she go to a hotel?

23:03.671 --> 23:05.482
I think if it was
nothing, she'd stay.

23:05.506 --> 23:06.724
Maybe.

23:07.425 --> 23:08.485
Maybe, but God, Will,

23:08.509 --> 23:10.863
what would someone like her
see in someone like me?

23:10.887 --> 23:13.365
Life is full of big
mysteries, Bay.

23:13.389 --> 23:15.576
How do... How do they get the
cheese in those hot dogs?

23:15.600 --> 23:17.276
Huh? You ever think about that?

23:18.227 --> 23:19.997
I'm telling you,
man, it's something,

23:20.021 --> 23:21.624
and you've got to do
something about it.

23:21.648 --> 23:23.000
I don't know, man.

23:23.024 --> 23:24.752
I don't want to make a
fool out of myself.

23:24.776 --> 23:25.961
Hey, every day you
get out of bed,

23:25.985 --> 23:27.254
you make a fool out of yourself.

23:27.278 --> 23:28.672
What you have to
ask yourself is,

23:28.696 --> 23:31.342
"Do I want to let this
opportunity pass me by?

23:31.366 --> 23:33.302
Do I really want to live life?"

23:33.326 --> 23:36.170
And, "Does she have
a friend for Will?"

24:15.868 --> 24:17.336
You missed your lesson today.

24:18.246 --> 24:19.547
Did I?

24:20.248 --> 24:21.590
I guess I forgot.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.229
Claudia, we've had
lessons every Thursday

24:25.253 --> 24:28.389
for the last three
years, and you forgot?

24:29.340 --> 24:30.683
You could have called.

24:31.759 --> 24:34.562
You're right. I'm sorry.

24:36.055 --> 24:37.523
What's going on here?

24:38.933 --> 24:41.235
Nothing.

24:41.561 --> 24:43.738
No, something's different.

24:44.188 --> 24:45.698
You're different.

24:47.984 --> 24:49.420
And the only thing
I can think of

24:49.444 --> 24:52.705
that has changed between us
is that I told you I'm gay.

24:55.324 --> 24:56.667
Is that it?

24:58.786 --> 24:59.722
Maybe.

24:59.746 --> 25:01.797
And you're having a
problem with that.

25:03.041 --> 25:05.185
If you are, then
at the very least,

25:05.209 --> 25:07.887
you owed it to me to come
talk to me about it.

25:09.756 --> 25:13.476
I mean, that's the way you and I
always deal with stuff, Claudia,

25:13.593 --> 25:14.935
like friends.

25:16.721 --> 25:20.066
Instead, you shut me out.
You stood me up.

25:21.392 --> 25:23.069
What do you want me to say?

25:23.478 --> 25:24.987
That it doesn't matter.

25:26.564 --> 25:28.074
Because it shouldn't.

25:28.608 --> 25:32.161
Look, my being gay doesn't have
anything to do with you, Claudia.

25:33.571 --> 25:35.956
It doesn't have anything
to do with your music.

25:38.201 --> 25:40.012
But since you seem
to think it does,

25:40.036 --> 25:41.962
maybe we shouldn't
be working together.

26:01.808 --> 26:03.192
Where's Greer?

26:03.434 --> 26:04.693
She's not here.

26:04.811 --> 26:06.904
Damn, I wanted to tell her
about the photo session.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.249
You know, you're totally wrong
about the photography guy.

26:09.273 --> 26:11.794
I just spent three hours with
him, and he was completely cool,

26:11.818 --> 26:14.463
and he thinks I could have a
great career, like Greer said.

26:14.487 --> 26:15.955
Wait, Jule.

26:16.364 --> 26:18.207
I gotta tell you something.

26:21.494 --> 26:22.962
She never met him.

26:23.830 --> 26:24.807
What?

26:24.831 --> 26:27.800
Greer... Never met Ed Brighton.

26:28.543 --> 26:31.188
He's not an old friend of hers.
He's not a famous photographer.

26:31.212 --> 26:32.981
She just got his name
out of the phone book.

26:33.005 --> 26:34.682
You don't know what
you're talking about.

26:44.767 --> 26:46.161
He isn't someone you can trust.

26:46.185 --> 26:48.529
He's just some guy you
gave a lot of money to.

26:51.941 --> 26:53.544
When is she coming back?

26:53.568 --> 26:56.245
She's not. She split.
She went to some hotel.

26:57.738 --> 27:00.249
What, she left without
saying goodbye? Why?

27:00.616 --> 27:02.626
Beats me.

27:03.077 --> 27:04.545
I can't explain her.

27:06.205 --> 27:07.673
I'm sorry.

27:08.916 --> 27:11.594
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, I am.

27:11.836 --> 27:13.220
I really am.

27:14.589 --> 27:16.390
Look, maybe you can
get the money back.

27:29.645 --> 27:30.821
Hi.

27:31.147 --> 27:34.450
I was... I was just kind of
in the neighborhood, so...

27:36.277 --> 27:37.453
Okay.

27:42.658 --> 27:44.168
This is nice.

27:44.660 --> 27:45.836
This is...

27:46.287 --> 27:47.838
This is one of their
regular rooms?

27:48.748 --> 27:53.302
Hmm. It's great. It's a really nice hotel.
The lobby was very...

27:54.337 --> 27:55.596
Spacious.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.683
Can I get you
something to drink?

28:00.218 --> 28:03.572
You mean, like, room service?
No, no, that's too much.

28:03.596 --> 28:05.741
It's, like, two-fifty
for a soda.

28:05.765 --> 28:09.286
No, it's, uh... Water.

28:09.310 --> 28:10.903
Yeah, a glass of water.

28:30.081 --> 28:32.716
- It's not very cold.
- That's okay.

28:38.714 --> 28:39.932
I'm finished.

28:44.136 --> 28:45.437
Bailey...

28:46.681 --> 28:48.566
What? I'm sorry.

28:48.766 --> 28:51.068
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't...
I didn't mean to...

28:52.895 --> 28:54.572
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I...

28:55.356 --> 28:57.834
I... I feel like such an idiot.
I just... I mean...

28:57.858 --> 28:59.285
I'm so nervous.

28:59.819 --> 29:01.046
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.756
Relax. It's okay.

29:02.780 --> 29:05.082
No, I'm so bad at this.
I don't know how...

29:05.283 --> 29:08.043
To read people. I can't read anyone.
I just...

29:08.077 --> 29:10.421
I don't have any idea
what people are thinking.

29:10.746 --> 29:13.215
Girls... Women.

29:13.416 --> 29:15.175
I just... I thought that...

29:16.168 --> 29:18.429
- I thought...
- What?

29:20.798 --> 29:22.516
You didn't turn away from me.

29:25.970 --> 29:27.521
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:27.972 --> 29:31.525
I'm embarrassing you, and
I'm humiliating myself.

29:32.143 --> 29:33.277
No.

29:39.692 --> 29:42.369
You read signals just fine.

29:47.199 --> 29:48.375
I do?

29:58.544 --> 30:00.721
I think you are really,
really beautiful.

30:13.934 --> 30:16.070
- So, what happens now?
- Oh, Bailey...

30:17.146 --> 30:18.656
I know what I want.

30:19.815 --> 30:20.991
Um...

30:23.194 --> 30:24.954
Let's just say...

30:25.529 --> 30:28.916
That it's something that
we both really want.

30:30.534 --> 30:32.503
But as two adults,

30:32.912 --> 30:36.382
we just thought better of it.

30:54.183 --> 30:55.776
Where have you guys been?

30:57.395 --> 31:00.030
Uh, just out.

31:01.982 --> 31:03.418
I want to talk to you.

31:03.442 --> 31:05.995
- Is there a problem, Charlie?
- Yeah.

31:06.153 --> 31:07.871
What were you doing with Julia?

31:08.364 --> 31:10.342
I mean, you get her all excited
about this photographer guy,

31:10.366 --> 31:12.376
and it turns out he's no one.
He's just...

31:12.618 --> 31:14.221
A name from the phone book.

31:14.245 --> 31:16.005
Why would you do that to me?

31:16.747 --> 31:18.225
Oh, Julia,

31:18.249 --> 31:19.893
I just wanted you to be happy.

31:19.917 --> 31:22.562
I just wanted you to feel
great about yourself.

31:22.586 --> 31:23.772
There are so many reasons...

31:23.796 --> 31:27.067
Yeah, right, so many reasons that I have
to pay someone to tell me I'm beautiful.

31:27.091 --> 31:29.852
Oh, no, honey, that's
not true at all.

31:31.345 --> 31:34.116
Look, maybe it was a lie
about the photographer,

31:34.140 --> 31:36.326
but that doesn't mean it
isn't the truth about you.

31:36.350 --> 31:39.611
And then when I want to ask you about
it, you're gone, you just take off.

31:40.646 --> 31:41.947
I'm sorry.

31:43.983 --> 31:45.325
It's just...

31:49.488 --> 31:53.250
It would've been better if you'd
just never started being my friend.

31:54.118 --> 31:55.711
Oh, Julia.

31:55.745 --> 31:58.557
You just... End up hurting
people who believe in you

31:58.581 --> 32:00.466
when so much of what
you say is a lie.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.552
I called your publisher.

32:04.170 --> 32:05.647
There is no promo tour.

32:05.671 --> 32:07.973
He says he hasn't even
seen you in a year.

32:08.883 --> 32:11.194
I was going to get in touch with
him as soon as I finish a few...

32:11.218 --> 32:12.770
Look, it doesn't matter.

32:13.596 --> 32:15.272
It really doesn't matter now.

32:15.723 --> 32:20.903
You guys, none of this was
meant to hurt any of you.

32:21.896 --> 32:25.365
When I came here, you all felt
so badly about yourselves,

32:25.775 --> 32:29.463
and it seemed to me that there was another
way of looking at your situations,

32:29.487 --> 32:31.882
and if I could help
you to see that,

32:31.906 --> 32:33.341
if I could make
you feel better...

32:33.365 --> 32:35.343
Yeah, but, Greer, pretending
everything is great

32:35.367 --> 32:37.387
does not automatically
make it great.

32:37.411 --> 32:40.130
It can. It can help.

32:41.081 --> 32:43.175
That's all I wanted to do.

32:43.459 --> 32:45.344
That's all any of
this was about.

32:47.922 --> 32:49.389
I'm sorry.

32:55.346 --> 32:57.022
I think you should leave.

33:06.440 --> 33:09.368
Listen, don't ever
sell yourself short.

33:09.568 --> 33:12.287
You do a pretty damn good job
taking care of these kids.

33:24.333 --> 33:25.843
What do you need, Claud?

33:27.378 --> 33:29.179
I think I did something bad.

33:31.382 --> 33:33.142
I skipped my violin lesson.

33:34.093 --> 33:35.686
Uh-huh. Well,

33:36.637 --> 33:38.147
you can probably make it up.

33:40.266 --> 33:41.775
Maybe not.

33:45.312 --> 33:47.239
I skipped it because
Ross is gay.

33:48.482 --> 33:49.783
What?

33:50.776 --> 33:52.202
He's gay.

33:52.653 --> 33:56.290
I know that, but why would
you skip your lesson?

33:57.157 --> 33:58.876
I don't know. It just...

33:59.660 --> 34:01.295
It just felt weird.

34:03.873 --> 34:06.175
You think I did
something really bad?

34:07.167 --> 34:08.594
Well...

34:09.210 --> 34:10.637
He's your friend.

34:10.920 --> 34:12.222
I know.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.308
I mean,

34:14.425 --> 34:16.810
do you have any
friends who are gay?

34:17.511 --> 34:18.853
Some.

34:19.429 --> 34:21.106
And it doesn't matter to you?

34:22.349 --> 34:25.235
It's different, and...

34:25.311 --> 34:28.322
I don't completely understand
it all the time, you know,

34:28.898 --> 34:33.378
but lots of people are different
in lots of different ways,

34:33.402 --> 34:34.828
and...

34:35.696 --> 34:37.246
I know it shouldn't matter.

34:37.697 --> 34:39.166
I mean, I know that.

34:39.699 --> 34:42.053
It doesn't change a friendship.

34:42.077 --> 34:44.129
It shouldn't change the
way you feel about Ross.

34:45.496 --> 34:47.424
It just makes me mad.

34:47.583 --> 34:49.426
What, at him?

34:49.835 --> 34:51.303
I just wish...

34:54.380 --> 34:56.725
Can't he stop being gay?

34:58.636 --> 35:00.229
I don't think so.

35:00.721 --> 35:02.397
That's just the way it is.

35:02.681 --> 35:05.150
Well, I guess that's
kind of too bad.

35:05.935 --> 35:07.861
Not if you're doing
what you want,

35:08.312 --> 35:09.905
not if you're happy.

35:11.941 --> 35:13.543
Hey, Julia, good to see you.

35:13.567 --> 35:14.826
I want my money back.

35:15.819 --> 35:18.006
You what? Why?

35:18.030 --> 35:19.414
You lied to me.

35:19.448 --> 35:22.469
You never met Greer. You only said
you did so you could get my money.

35:22.493 --> 35:25.504
Oh, just calm down a
minute, just wait a sec.

35:25.788 --> 35:27.849
I would not have
taken your money

35:27.873 --> 35:31.102
if I didn't think that it was worthwhile
for you to have pictures made.

35:31.126 --> 35:34.137
Right, you lied to me before, and now
you're being completely straight.

35:34.421 --> 35:38.735
Look, your friend told me to say that I
knew her so that it would relax you,

35:38.759 --> 35:39.945
which it did, right?

35:39.969 --> 35:42.145
Yeah, it relaxed me
out of 800 bucks.

35:42.179 --> 35:44.783
Do you have any idea
what $800 means to me?

35:44.807 --> 35:46.108
Sure I do,

35:46.809 --> 35:48.151
but it was worth it.

35:49.228 --> 35:52.072
Your pictures are great.

35:52.481 --> 35:54.376
You're just saying that so
you can keep the money.

35:54.400 --> 35:57.671
Look, Julia, I can keep
the money no matter what.

35:57.695 --> 35:59.923
I'm saying it because it's true.

35:59.947 --> 36:01.290
Take a look.

36:03.742 --> 36:05.711
And it's not just my opinion.

36:05.911 --> 36:07.764
A friend of mine who has
an agency came by today.

36:07.788 --> 36:09.589
He saw these, and
he asked about you.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.218
Really? What for?

36:13.293 --> 36:14.562
For work.

36:14.586 --> 36:17.139
He's looking for faces
for picture frames.

36:17.506 --> 36:18.724
For what?

36:19.174 --> 36:20.694
You know, when you
buy a picture frame

36:20.718 --> 36:24.146
and it's already got a picture of
somebody in it? He needs faces for that.

36:24.805 --> 36:26.032
And he was interested in me?

36:26.056 --> 36:28.817
It's not as much money as
catalog work, but it's cash.

36:29.226 --> 36:31.820
Look, here's his card.

36:33.147 --> 36:34.406
Give him a call.

36:43.574 --> 36:44.791
Hey, Claud.

36:46.994 --> 36:48.337
What's so important?

36:51.415 --> 36:52.924
An apology.

36:54.168 --> 36:56.595
It's pretty important,
don't you think?

36:59.381 --> 37:01.391
I'm sorry, Ross.

37:02.885 --> 37:04.978
I want you to be my teacher.

37:06.889 --> 37:09.691
But if you don't want
to do that, or...

37:10.517 --> 37:12.912
Even be friends
with me anymore...

37:12.936 --> 37:14.363
Claudia...

37:19.234 --> 37:21.411
I want to be friends with you

37:22.029 --> 37:24.215
if you want to treat
me like a friend.

37:24.239 --> 37:25.665
I do.

37:26.533 --> 37:29.711
I'm really sorry.

37:32.039 --> 37:33.882
I guess I was just...

37:35.125 --> 37:36.760
Kind of disappointed.

37:37.753 --> 37:40.597
And... And sad.

37:41.715 --> 37:42.933
Sad?

37:43.801 --> 37:45.394
Yeah.

37:45.928 --> 37:47.479
It's pretty stupid...

37:50.015 --> 37:52.776
But ever since that
first time I met you...

37:53.060 --> 37:54.277
Remember?

37:56.605 --> 37:58.124
When I played, I was so nervous,

37:58.148 --> 38:00.409
I really messed up my bowing.

38:02.903 --> 38:04.788
Ever since then, I...

38:05.656 --> 38:07.749
I guess I kind of
thought, you know...

38:10.327 --> 38:12.337
You were really nice to me...

38:14.206 --> 38:17.926
And you were sort of cute, too.

38:19.002 --> 38:24.015
I guess maybe I just thought,
you know, when I grew up...

38:25.551 --> 38:27.686
Maybe you'd want
to get married...

38:30.597 --> 38:31.940
To me.

38:34.351 --> 38:36.027
Might be a little old for you.

38:37.271 --> 38:39.030
I could've learned
to overlook it...

38:41.483 --> 38:45.454
But since we're never going to
get past that other issue...

38:46.113 --> 38:48.290
I thought I'd do the
next best thing.

38:50.701 --> 38:53.503
Ross, I'd like you to meet Nick.

38:53.787 --> 38:56.182
- Nick will be our waiter tonight.
- Claudia!

38:56.206 --> 38:59.509
Nick likes water skiing
and <i>Monty Python.</i>

39:01.879 --> 39:03.346
Come in.

39:07.259 --> 39:09.227
Just set it down by
the bed, please.

39:20.480 --> 39:22.282
I thought you were room service.

39:23.275 --> 39:25.744
I need to know what happened
between us last night.

39:26.695 --> 39:29.831
I need to know what
you were doing,

39:31.200 --> 39:33.919
if it was all a game, or if the
whole thing was some kind of...

39:34.411 --> 39:35.837
Charity.

39:36.747 --> 39:39.591
- You think I'd do that?
- Yeah, I think you might,

39:40.667 --> 39:42.219
to make me feel better.

39:43.086 --> 39:45.388
Like you were trying to make
Julia feel better, like you...

39:46.298 --> 39:48.860
Like you made her think she was special.
And it turns out...

39:48.884 --> 39:51.228
You are special, Bailey.

39:52.471 --> 39:54.439
I wasn't playing
any game with you.

39:56.099 --> 39:57.442
No?

39:57.893 --> 39:59.110
No.

40:04.983 --> 40:06.493
So you wanted to be with me.

40:10.489 --> 40:12.582
It wasn't a charity, Bailey.

40:13.325 --> 40:16.753
I can't think of anyone who needs
that kind of charity less.

40:17.704 --> 40:19.089
Do you believe that?

40:21.208 --> 40:22.634
I want to.

40:24.127 --> 40:25.595
Believe it.

41:01.581 --> 41:02.976
Hi. Who's here?

41:03.000 --> 41:04.769
- Everyone.
- Really?

41:04.793 --> 41:07.137
- Who did you come with?
- No one.

41:07.254 --> 41:08.805
Wow. Really?

41:08.922 --> 41:10.307
Really.

41:10.340 --> 41:11.600
Catch you later.

41:18.724 --> 41:20.150
You want to dance?

41:32.612 --> 41:34.122
So she left?

41:34.281 --> 41:36.791
So it was nothing after all?

41:37.034 --> 41:38.543
Yeah, it was nothing.

41:39.161 --> 41:40.337
Huh.

41:41.455 --> 41:44.674
How come that kind of nothing
never happens to me?

41:47.294 --> 41:49.054
Who you looking for?

41:50.380 --> 41:52.057
I don't know yet.

42:19.659 --> 42:21.220
There was that one
guy I kind of liked,

42:21.244 --> 42:22.671
the one I was dancing with.

42:22.829 --> 42:24.891
You danced with every
guy there, Julia.

42:24.915 --> 42:27.008
Even one with a shaved head.

42:27.125 --> 42:30.303
You can't date a guy with a shaved head.
It would scare Claudia.

42:30.796 --> 42:33.733
On second thought,
it would scare me.

42:33.757 --> 42:34.891
So...

42:38.011 --> 42:39.354
Meet anyone great?

42:39.888 --> 42:41.064
No.

42:41.515 --> 42:42.617
But, you know, so what?

42:42.641 --> 42:45.203
I still had a good time. I
usually hate those things.

42:45.227 --> 42:48.363
Yeah, but if you're
in the right mood...

42:48.605 --> 42:49.781
Right.

42:52.234 --> 42:54.411
So how do you get
in the right mood?

43:00.409 --> 43:01.751
Hmm.

43:03.078 --> 43:05.839
Well, then, here's to Greer.

43:06.123 --> 43:08.216
Yeah, here's to her.

43:09.668 --> 43:11.177
What are we toasting?

43:12.963 --> 43:15.056
The fact that we kind of
got things under control.

43:15.507 --> 43:17.151
Except that little
nanny problem.

43:17.175 --> 43:20.029
- Yeah. -Oh, I didn't tell you?
I found someone.

43:20.053 --> 43:21.271
You did?

43:21.430 --> 43:24.107
Experienced in child care,
excellent references...

43:24.683 --> 43:27.444
What about the temptation issue?

43:27.769 --> 43:30.280
- Not a problem.
- Are you sure?

43:30.897 --> 43:33.324
- Trust me.
- What's her name?

43:34.651 --> 43:35.952
Bill.

43:43.034 --> 43:46.013
Excuse me, there isn't one female
nanny you trust yourself around?

43:46.037 --> 43:49.466
Hey, you said, "Make sure there
aren't gonna be any problems." So...

43:49.708 --> 43:51.769
That's just a little
pathetic, Charlie.

43:51.793 --> 43:53.344
Yeah, well...

43:55.755 --> 43:58.558
So this Bill guy, is he cute?

44:02.387 --> 44:03.730
Oh, no.

44:04.890 --> 44:06.242
Well?

44:06.266 --> 44:08.234
Don't even think about it.
