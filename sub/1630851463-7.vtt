00:08.299 --> 00:10.552
Previously on
Top Chef Family Style...

00:10.593 --> 00:13.596
Each chef team must create
a show stopping dessert.

00:13.638 --> 00:15.306
This is not my comfort zone

00:15.557 --> 00:17.392
I need you to focus on this

00:17.434 --> 00:18.893
because nothing else
matters right now.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.729
We're literally putting
ice cream on fire.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.064
- We've got to step it up.
- Oh, my God.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.482
Who's ready for dessert?

00:24.524 --> 00:26.067
Dessert is the
only thing that I eat.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.236
- Ice cream a little bit runny.
- Oh, my God.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.405
Ocean and Jaydene.
Oh, they got the fire.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.574
- The presentation is amazing.
- It's just good.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.409
Our favorite dish today...

00:34.451 --> 00:36.161
Ocean and Jaydene.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.246
- Yeah!
- Congrats!

00:39.205 --> 00:41.207
Milan and Chandrani.
I'm so sorry.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.418
Please pack your knives and go.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.088
Eight duos remain.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.757
I can't reach.

00:48.798 --> 00:49.841
Voila.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.259
We killed that.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.763
At stake,
$50,000 and the chance

00:54.804 --> 00:59.142
to be crowned the champions
of Top Chef Family Style.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.613
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:11.654 --> 01:15.742
welcome to the Top Chef
Family Stylekitchen arena.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.787
For tonight's main event.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.164
Eva and Jenn.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.292
Are we cooking or wrestling

01:24.334 --> 01:26.461
or cooking wrestling
or whatever?

01:26.503 --> 01:28.797
Something is going
down in that ring today?

01:28.838 --> 01:33.301
Give it up for
Ocean and Jaydene.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.721
Anika and Anu.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.848
Oh, my God, where are we?
This does not look

01:38.890 --> 01:41.434
like a family style kitchen,
anymore.

01:41.476 --> 01:44.729
Khalil and Willie.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.815
Jack and Bobbie.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.233
Go Jack and Bobbie.

01:48.274 --> 01:53.279
Delilah And Danny.
Kennedy and Rosie.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.657
Kaj and Liz.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.909
Kaj and Liz.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.747
Chefs, get ready for some
amazing action.

02:03.498 --> 02:07.794
Today is WWE Day here
at Top Chef Family Style.

02:09.045 --> 02:13.925
I'm so happy.
I grew up watching WWE.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.887
I love seeing everyone
getting like hit by a chair.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.598
It's so funny.
The smallest person in the group

02:20.640 --> 02:24.477
would be the biggest fan of WWE.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.855
Chefs, you made it

02:26.896 --> 02:28.314
to the halfway point
in the competition.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.028
Meghan and I
are so proud of you.

02:33.069 --> 02:37.615
It takes dedication, teamwork,
passion and, of course,

02:37.657 --> 02:40.535
great cooking to make it as
far as you guys have done.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.912
Our guest judges for today
know all about that.

02:42.954 --> 02:45.749
Joining us are two
Top Chefalumni,

02:45.790 --> 02:48.793
successful restauranteur
Brian Malarkey

02:49.461 --> 02:52.922
and award-winning chef
Amar Santana.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.801
Thank you.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.803
Meghan and Marcus have told me
you are amazing

02:58.845 --> 03:01.556
and I cannot
wait to eat your food.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.142
You guys are the future
of our industry.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.978
Just cook with your heart and
don't get too complicated.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.357
Chefs, today we're going
to swerve.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.817
There is no Quickfire.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.653
Instead, you'll be battling
to become

03:15.695 --> 03:19.366
Top Chef Family Style
kitchen champions.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.784
And here to coach
you through it...

03:21.951 --> 03:26.081
Four of the biggest superstars
of WWE.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.583
Naomi!

03:29.959 --> 03:31.795
Oh, my God.

03:33.254 --> 03:36.466
The Miz!

03:39.052 --> 03:41.262
I love him!

03:41.304 --> 03:45.517
Introducing Maryse!

03:46.101 --> 03:47.977
I grew up watching WWE

03:48.019 --> 03:50.397
on Saturday mornings
with my brothers.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.857
So I'm pumped, I'm excited,
like,

03:52.899 --> 03:55.235
this is bringing me back
to my childhood.

03:55.276 --> 03:58.154
I thought it was boxing.

03:58.822 --> 04:04.619
All the way from Scotland,
Drew McIntyre!

04:07.956 --> 04:09.708
I hope I'm not wrestling
any of them,

04:09.749 --> 04:11.793
I would
get snapped in half.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.753
Although he was pretty strong.

04:16.381 --> 04:20.010
Chefs, today's elimination
consists of three matches.

04:20.051 --> 04:23.138
You'll be split into
four superstar teams.

04:23.179 --> 04:28.852
Team Naomi, Team Miz,
Team Maryse, and Team Drew,

04:28.893 --> 04:32.188
and each team will be made
up of two chefs duos.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.733
You know, I wouldn't say
there's anybody

04:34.774 --> 04:36.484
we don't want
to get teamed up with.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.820
I will say, though, that I
don't want to do any arguing.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.822
So if we do get teamed
up with Eva and Jenn,

04:40.864 --> 04:43.324
we got to figure out a way to
make this whole thing work.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.868
You said it, not me.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.203
The first match
is our own version

04:47.245 --> 04:49.664
of the famous Battle Royal.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.000
Each team will have 30 minutes
to create a dish,

04:52.042 --> 04:56.171
highlighting a secret ingredient
chosen by their team superstar.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.048
the team that
makes our favorite dish

04:58.089 --> 05:01.426
will move on to the
Championship Tag Team match,

05:01.468 --> 05:03.595
where they will split up
and square off

05:03.636 --> 05:05.513
to compete for the title.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.682
The team that makes our least
favorite dish

05:07.724 --> 05:09.934
will have to compete
in the Signature Move

05:09.976 --> 05:13.021
Elimination Match
where one chef duo

05:13.063 --> 05:14.731
will be sent home.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.025
All right, chefs, it's time
to pick your team.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.862
Grab one action figure from
the backpack and pass it down.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.866
We got The Miz.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.826
The Miz!

05:26.868 --> 05:28.828
- Okay Anika.
- Drew.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.413
- The Miz.
- Again?

05:30.455 --> 05:32.415
I'm a popular guy, popular guy.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.250
Naomi.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.461
I got Maryse.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.254
Naomi.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.257
- We got Drew.
- We got Maryse.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.676
Yes, Maryse.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.302
We got our teams?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.304
Okay, chefs and superstars,

05:46.346 --> 05:47.931
you can head to your stations.

05:49.432 --> 05:52.769
Chefs, we asked the superstars
to pick one secret ingredient

05:52.811 --> 05:54.437
that they'd like to see
you highlight

05:54.479 --> 05:55.897
in your battle royal dish.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.941
Naomi, what ingredient
did you select?

05:57.982 --> 05:59.734
I wanted to pick an ingredient

05:59.776 --> 06:01.611
that will shine in any meal.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.948
Garlic. Yeah.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.117
My finishing move is called
the Claymore.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.744
I've used it to defeat such
superstars like Brock Lesnar,

06:09.786 --> 06:12.997
The Miz, Randy Orton,
The Miz, Goldberg,

06:13.039 --> 06:15.417
- The Miz also.
- Many times, many times.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.252
And I'm still standing.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.797
So I picked something with a bit
of a kick. Chili Peppers

06:22.716 --> 06:25.969
My submission move is the
Figure-four leglock,

06:26.011 --> 06:28.138
so your
ingredient is...

06:28.596 --> 06:30.265
Chicken legs.

06:30.306 --> 06:31.683
You did good.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.226
Okay, I can deal with that.

06:33.268 --> 06:36.021
Is that okay, is that alright?
Okay, alright.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.606
- Maryse?
- I have a really big obsession.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.275
I pretty much put it
on everything

06:40.316 --> 06:42.819
and I just want to apologize
for the bill.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.488
Truffles.

06:46.364 --> 06:49.075
- High end, high end.
- Fancy.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.537
Okay chefs, remember
you must work in teams.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.956
You'll have five minutes
to menu plan

06:54.998 --> 06:57.542
and 30 minutes
to create your best dish.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.628
Chefs, the first bout
of the night.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.173
The battle royal!

07:04.174 --> 07:06.468
Yeah, let's go!

07:06.509 --> 07:09.721
Fire up the kitchen!

07:09.763 --> 07:12.182
Your time starts now.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.392
Good luck.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.062
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- I have an idea.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.814
- Are you menu planning with us?
- If I can help in any way.

07:19.856 --> 07:24.027
Okay, garlic. A garlic,
toasted, fried crostini.

07:24.361 --> 07:29.532
Crisp up Portobello mushroom
slices and then a goat cheese--

07:29.574 --> 07:31.826
You don't think goat cheese is
going to be too overpowering?

07:31.868 --> 07:33.745
You're don't want to pick
a mild cheese so that--

07:33.787 --> 07:35.413
Goat cheese goes nice with
Portobello mushrooms.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.667
- Okay, goat cheese.
- You're going to roast garlic.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.502
- So mom, what I'm going to do--
- One second.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.671
You're going to take those,
slice them in half.

07:42.712 --> 07:46.091
We're going to let Eva and Jenn
take the lead on this one,

07:46.132 --> 07:48.218
- We don't want any trouble.
- We don't want any trouble.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.178
So I'm going to get
the onions and mushrooms

07:50.220 --> 07:52.681
- and I'm going to get started--
- I'm gonna get the mushrooms.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.182
You are going to get the onions.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.684
Maybe the tacos.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.061
Then we can make like
a spicy sausages on top.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.188
But I don't like spice,
so I don't...

08:00.230 --> 08:02.232
This is not good for you.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.442
Today, you love spice.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.903
I think it's going to be really
hard to incorporate

08:06.945 --> 08:10.156
peppers and make it like
the star of a dish.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.784
If you get a chunk of pepper
in your mouth,

08:12.826 --> 08:14.828
it'll blow your head off.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.372
We could do like tacos.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.873
With like some queso fresco.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.710
Avocado crema with, like,
the peppers in it.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.004
Are you a flour or corn
tortilla guy?

08:24.045 --> 08:26.297
Which one is less likely to
fall apart in your hands?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.216
- Flour.
- Flour. Done.

08:28.258 --> 08:32.762
What if we did the figure-four
lollipop chicken legs?

08:32.804 --> 08:35.515
- Four chicken?
- No, it's the figure-four.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.100
- Yeah.
- Anyway,

08:37.142 --> 08:39.185
so what if we did a
deep fried chicken leg?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.770
We made it
a chicken leg lollipop?

08:40.812 --> 08:42.397
- Okay.
- So what if we, I mean,

08:42.439 --> 08:44.607
even if you did that and
you did like a chicken

08:44.649 --> 08:46.901
and waffles, and then you
kind of had like

08:46.943 --> 08:48.945
an Asian zingy sauce?

08:48.987 --> 08:50.905
- Will it work with a waffle?
- Yeah, sure.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.949
- Okay.
- Works with anything come on.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.909
Chicken and waffles,
I'll tell you what,

08:54.951 --> 08:56.745
as soon as you said
that I'm like, "I'm in."

08:56.786 --> 08:59.289
So we're thinking we do pasta.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.833
Do pasta like a light
cream parmesan sauce?

09:01.875 --> 09:04.377
Like a truffle infused
cream sauce?

09:04.419 --> 09:06.755
Who wants to be
in charge of what?

09:06.796 --> 09:08.590
You guys, what are
you comfortable with?

09:08.631 --> 09:10.091
I'll be in charge
of getting,

09:10.133 --> 09:11.885
starting the process of boiling
the water,

09:11.926 --> 09:13.887
adding that, me and Liz
will do cream sauce.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.639
Okay, let's go.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.684
Go time team, let's go, get it.

09:19.726 --> 09:23.897
Here we go, baby.
Here we go. Here we go!

09:23.938 --> 09:26.649
Yeah, ain't no one
taking us out, baby.

09:26.691 --> 09:27.984
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.486
They got it going on.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.112
I'm scared.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.989
I'm ready to go.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.493
Think of the most encouraging
inspirational speech

09:36.534 --> 09:38.036
you ever got in your life.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.954
And imagine I'm telling
you that right now.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.833
Is water--
is pasta water boiling?

09:43.875 --> 09:45.502
No, not even close.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.546
Okay, I don't know these
induction burners, 180 degrees?

09:48.588 --> 09:49.964
What is it at right now?

09:50.006 --> 09:52.759
- Can you get a lid for that?
- Yeah.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.886
Kaj and I are just finally
in our rhythm

09:54.928 --> 09:56.805
where we get
one another's palates.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.848
We've got our groove going,

09:58.890 --> 10:00.767
and now we've got to work
with Jack and Bobbie.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.310
Okay.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.688
It's hard enough being a
team of two like to add

10:04.729 --> 10:08.566
a whole other duo in makes it
so much more complicated

10:08.608 --> 10:10.193
Is pasta in the water yet?

10:10.235 --> 10:13.279
No, not yet. It's not--
It's not boiling yet.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.614
Have it on 1,200.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.199
It can go higher than 1,200.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.620
- Are you guys nervous at all?
- Uh, excuse me.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.622
Because I'm telling you what
you're going to take a bite

10:22.664 --> 10:24.666
of this dish and you're
going to be like, OMG.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.334
Ain't nobody want
your chicken legs.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.712
How much time we got?
We got 25 minutes.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.839
I'm spraying this
juice in my eye.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.340
We're working well as a team.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.134
We all have a different
responsibility

10:34.175 --> 10:36.011
and then we're going to come
together at the end,

10:36.052 --> 10:38.096
which is a good strategy.
Especially in this challenge

10:38.138 --> 10:39.597
just because there's not
very much time

10:39.639 --> 10:41.433
What's y'all's fears about using
these peppers?

10:41.474 --> 10:43.643
Yeah, we just don't want
to make it super spicy

10:43.685 --> 10:45.437
that nobody can eat it.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.855
I'm not that worried.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.481
Really?

10:48.523 --> 10:50.275
Where are we putting
the garlic once it's roasted?

10:50.316 --> 10:53.194
We're going to purée it
to make it confit.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.447
Quick, I need a group opinion
goat cheese or cheddar?

10:55.488 --> 10:58.199
- Goat cheese goes with--
- Which has the softer...

10:58.241 --> 11:00.618
Portobello mushrooms very well.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.245
I know what tastes good.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.831
Some misos in there is going
to give it a salty--

11:06.875 --> 11:08.626
Oh, my God,
it's way too sour.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.755
Take a little taste
of mom's béchamel.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.757
- It needs salt.
- Okay.

11:14.257 --> 11:16.634
This needs garlic salt,
give me the garlic salt.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.345
What's a lollipop chicken?

11:18.386 --> 11:21.056
So basically, lollipopping
chillen is like-- "Chillen."

11:21.097 --> 11:23.224
Lollipopping chicken is like
where you go to the top

11:23.266 --> 11:24.976
of the bone
and you push the rest

11:25.018 --> 11:26.519
of the meat down
like he's doing.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.355
So it just makes the chicken
look better.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.398
- Alright.
- Provides a better presentation

11:30.440 --> 11:32.734
if you got a nice, beautiful
hunk of meat at the bottom.

11:32.776 --> 11:33.818
I see.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.741
You guys feel
like champions today?

11:39.783 --> 11:40.909
Champions.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.452
We ready, we got
you covered man.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.746
- Do me good guys.
- We got you covered boss.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.581
Don't embarrass me!

11:46.623 --> 11:49.167
Team Miz is the kind of energy
I like to cook with, alright?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.711
- Over the top. Going for it.
- Oh yeah.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.798
You guys, you need some
acid in there, like a vinegar.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.591
Ten minutes.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.594
At three minutes, let's pull
the pasta and get it in here.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.721
- It went in at 12 minutes.
- I thought we were--

12:01.763 --> 12:05.058
- It went in at 12 minutes?
- It went in at 12 minutes.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.893
Water still wasn't boiling.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.812
We are watching
the time count down

12:08.853 --> 12:11.106
and we're thinking
we're not going to have pasta.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.733
Early plating at two and
a half minutes, probably.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.318
That would be the worst

12:15.360 --> 12:16.945
because then we know
we're in the bottom.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.488
I have to be going
up against Kaj.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.198
I really don't want that.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.242
If we
don't get it all on the plate,

12:23.326 --> 12:25.537
that's worse than
it being, I mean...

12:36.798 --> 12:38.925
Let me taste this.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.553
Oh my God, this is so spicy.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.180
- I think it's good.
- Tournaments are stressful

12:44.222 --> 12:46.266
because if you lose
the first round itself

12:46.307 --> 12:48.268
that could put you
in the danger zone.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.186
I think you should take
out some of those.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.771
That's how we like it. Spicy.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.065
It's okay. Anika
can't tolerate it, it's fine.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.567
If you feel it's okay,
it's okay.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.776
Okay, okay, okay.

12:56.818 --> 12:57.944
How's it going down there?

12:57.986 --> 12:59.612
Ah, it's nerve wracking.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.448
Like, I'm more nervous about
this than wrestling

13:01.489 --> 13:03.616
at WrestleMania in front
of 80,000 people.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.452
I think we should fry
those crostinis

13:05.493 --> 13:07.287
it's going
to take too long.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.539
I think we got-- I honestly
think we got it. Let me--

13:09.581 --> 13:11.291
Danny, they're going
to take one minute.

13:11.332 --> 13:14.210
If the judges say something
about the cheese sauce

13:14.252 --> 13:17.172
or the crostini,
I definitely think Eva and Jenn

13:17.213 --> 13:18.965
are going to want to kill us.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.592
I do not want
to make them angry.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.385
And the crostinis,
don't worry about it.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.304
Just worry about the sauce
and the mushroom.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.139
Alright, the waffles are
starting to brown, thank God.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.974
I am nervous about the pasta.

13:28.016 --> 13:33.146
If the pasta's not cooked, is
there shame in presenting--

13:33.188 --> 13:34.814
No, no, it has to be pasta.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.566
We can't just give them
a bunch of sauce.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.819
We might go down on the fact
that our pasta is not cooked.

13:39.861 --> 13:42.238
I just am feeling like it
would be a lot easier

13:42.280 --> 13:43.948
if Kaj and I just did this
by ourselves.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.326
Two people are going to need
to plate pasta at once.

13:46.368 --> 13:49.496
Time is too tight for one person
to do the plating.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.957
Let's get the tortillas
done, guys.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.043
- Shall I do the cremas?
- Yes.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.004
Five minutes, five minutes left.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.339
I think he should drain it now.

13:59.381 --> 14:00.840
Got to run
it back and forth.

14:00.882 --> 14:03.134
- I mean, yeah, drain it now
- Oh, my God.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.594
This part, isn't cooked.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.513
It's all right. Take that
and go. Go, hurry.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.849
Ocean! No, it's spilling.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.351
Okay, go.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.019
Don't worry about pretty,
get it on the plate.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.063
I think it needs more
cheese sauce, to be honest.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.439
Okay, more cheese sauce.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.941
- What's the time?
- 30 seconds.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.526
30 seconds,
go, drizzle, drizzle, drizzle.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.402
Get the parsley.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.237
My God, lime, lime!

14:22.278 --> 14:23.780
- Lime wedge.
- Oh, hurry, hurry, hurry.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.532
- Oh, my God.
- Did you burn yourself?

14:25.573 --> 14:27.283
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

14:27.325 --> 14:33.289
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five, four...

14:33.331 --> 14:34.958
Jack do truffle salt.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.710
Three, two, one!

14:36.751 --> 14:37.961
Times up, hands up.

14:39.462 --> 14:42.257
- Hands up, hands up.
- Way to go, baby.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.218
That was like the fastest
pasta plate in the world.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.387
- Team Miz.
- Here we go.

14:47.429 --> 14:49.764
Welcome to the
main event, everyone.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.559
We made figure-four leglocked
chicken and waffles

14:52.600 --> 14:54.519
with a maple soy glaze.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.480
You took a comfort dish that
we've all had and loved,

14:57.522 --> 14:59.566
but you still made it with
your point of view.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.693
Like, I've never tried
chicken and waffles.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.487
I've seen it on the menu since I
came to America 13 years ago,

15:04.529 --> 15:06.239
and I was thinking who on earth

15:06.281 --> 15:08.241
would eat chicken and waffles in
the same dish.

15:08.283 --> 15:10.285
That sounds insanity,
but it's great.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.703
Like unbelievable.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.663
I am beyond proud.

15:13.705 --> 15:17.542
You guys were all on the same
page working with one another.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.461
Normally I say "I'm The Miz,
and I'm awesome,"

15:19.502 --> 15:24.215
but today you guys are awesome!

15:26.801 --> 15:29.137
Team Maryse, what did
you make for us?

15:29.179 --> 15:33.433
We made a truffle infused cream
and mascarpone sauce

15:33.475 --> 15:36.561
over fettuccine
with truffle crisp on top.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.356
I could be eating
this for breakfast,

15:39.397 --> 15:42.233
for lunch,
and for dinner every day.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.736
- Sorry, Mike.
- No, not no. Not sorry.

15:44.778 --> 15:48.323
I had no problem whatsoever.
I finished the plate.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.908
Thank you.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.660
It's super sophisticated,
way beyond your age.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.372
The sauce to pasta
ratio was a little off.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.582
But overall, it was a really,
really good dish.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.417
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.503
We pulled it off and hopefully
we're in the middle.

16:02.545 --> 16:05.799
Well done, well done,
well done guys.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.842
Wow.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.469
Team Naomi.

16:09.511 --> 16:12.305
So for today, we made
for you a roasted garlic,

16:12.347 --> 16:14.307
onion and mushroom crostini

16:14.349 --> 16:16.393
topped with creamy garlic
goat cheese sauce.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.728
I really like the mushroom

16:18.770 --> 16:21.564
because it picks up the texture
of a piece of meat.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.483
I'm dancing. I love it.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.026
It's crazy because
there's garlic,

16:25.068 --> 16:28.238
but it's not too much,
the balance is so good.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.698
You picked the perfect cheese.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.574
The texture of the mushroom
is perfect.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.993
You did very well with
communicating with each other

16:34.035 --> 16:36.663
and respecting each other's
viewpoints and ideas.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.206
That's what I was really
impressed about.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.959
- Thank you.
- We love you. Thank you.

16:41.001 --> 16:44.045
Team Drew, Tell us about the
dish you made for us today.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.923
We made for you guys a spicy,
bold taco.

16:46.965 --> 16:50.343
All three types of peppers,
purple cabbage slaw,

16:50.385 --> 16:53.388
pickled red onions
and a spicy avocado crema.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.266
Sucker's got some kick,
that is spicy.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.518
- You wanted some kick, huh?
- Oh yeah.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.353
Honestly, I'll take this

17:00.395 --> 17:03.398
over a claymore kick
any day of the week.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.233
Thank you for going for it.

17:05.275 --> 17:09.821
The textures, how you added in
cabbage and a lot of citrus.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.824
All of that helps to
highlight the chili.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.201
And chilies were really
something you can get

17:15.243 --> 17:16.870
in a lot of trouble with.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.414
I thought it was incredibly
well balanced. Amazing.

17:19.456 --> 17:21.624
I would put this
on my menu any time.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.251
I want like seconds,
thirds, fourths.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.045
That is so awesome!

17:25.086 --> 17:27.505
We catch you from the first
bite and we're unforgettable.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.466
- Hell of a job.
- Thank you.

17:29.507 --> 17:31.384
Guys, all four teams.

17:31.426 --> 17:32.552
All four teams.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.679
All four teams, well done.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.350
Okay, judges, it's time to
vote for our favorite dishes

17:38.391 --> 17:39.893
on the scorecard in
front of you.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.812
Please cast your vote
and pass it to me.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.317
Ah ha.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.409
Ladies, gentlemen, and chefs.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.411
The votes are in.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.206
The winners of the battle royal

18:01.247 --> 18:02.916
and the team that will move on

18:02.957 --> 18:06.503
to the Championship tag
team match is...

18:12.300 --> 18:13.468
Team Drew.

18:15.804 --> 18:19.307
Anika and Anu,
Kennedy and Rosie.

18:21.893 --> 18:23.937
I'm excited just because
there's a chance

18:23.978 --> 18:26.439
of winning the whole thing,
and I haven't won

18:26.481 --> 18:28.441
a Quickfire or Elimination
Challenge yet.

18:28.483 --> 18:30.443
Boom. That's what
I'm talking about.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.362
- We got pepper.
- That hurts.

18:32.404 --> 18:36.116
The team with the lowest score
who will be competing

18:36.157 --> 18:39.494
in the Signature Move
Elimination match is...

18:43.415 --> 18:45.667
- Team Maryse.
- Oh.

18:46.751 --> 18:47.585
Okay.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.546
We're safe, guys.

18:49.587 --> 18:52.882
I'm not surprised, but we
had a really good dish.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.385
The little things send
you home now.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.971
Annika and Anu,
Kennedy and Rosie,

18:58.013 --> 19:00.473
you'll move on to the
Championship tag team match

19:00.515 --> 19:02.475
and compete for the title.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.394
You'll have 45 minutes
to make a dish

19:04.436 --> 19:06.187
that will knock
out your competition.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.064
You can make whatever you want,

19:08.106 --> 19:11.443
but that means only one chef
from your duo

19:11.484 --> 19:13.653
can be in the ring at any time,

19:13.695 --> 19:17.365
and you must swap out at
least three times.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.785
You have to tag each other
out to switch

19:20.827 --> 19:22.912
- in and out of the ring.
- We got this.

19:22.954 --> 19:25.081
Drew, I think you
have something for them.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.583
I do indeed.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.043
Before you get in the ring,

19:28.084 --> 19:30.128
each of you has to
have a team name.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.674
That is so cute!

19:34.716 --> 19:38.011
So we've got a couple of
Sharp as Knives over here.

19:38.053 --> 19:39.637
For the chefs who are
not cooking.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.097
You can take your place
in the audience.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.932
A couple of
Alaskan Foodies right here.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.851
- There you go.
- Thank you.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.478
And Anika and Anu,
Kennedy and Rosie,

19:46.519 --> 19:48.188
you may now enter the ring.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.023
Let's go.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.953
Ladies and gentlemen,
here they come.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.626
Yeah.

20:11.586 --> 20:12.962
Introducing, the chefs

20:13.004 --> 20:15.548
for this Championship
Tag Team match.

20:15.590 --> 20:20.011
The Alaskan Foodies,
Kennedy and Rosie.

20:21.054 --> 20:25.433
Team Sharp as Knives,
Anika and Anu

20:25.475 --> 20:26.685
Alright, Anika.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.603
Are you ready to throw down?

20:28.645 --> 20:31.314
Yeah.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.526
Your time starts now.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.658
Do you want to make--

20:41.700 --> 20:43.535
Get all of the ingredients
bell peppers.

20:46.371 --> 20:47.706
Here.

20:48.123 --> 20:51.292
Naomi, The Miz, this is
a tag team match.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.169
What should they be thinking
about right now?

20:53.211 --> 20:55.547
With a tag team, you want to
highlight what you do well

20:55.588 --> 20:57.841
and lowlight
what you don't do well.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.176
When you're in trouble
you got to tag out.

21:00.218 --> 21:02.929
Oh, so the person that's great
at prepping right now

21:02.971 --> 21:04.931
- is in there, right?
- Yes.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.641
What's going on here?

21:06.683 --> 21:09.853
We're doing chicken pipérade
with saffron potato purée.

21:09.894 --> 21:11.646
Do you make it often?

21:11.688 --> 21:13.773
I've made it for my family
and they've liked it before.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.025
We're elevating our pipérade

21:15.066 --> 21:16.901
by making saffron potato purée

21:16.943 --> 21:19.821
and sautéed Swiss chard.
We want to show new techniques

21:19.863 --> 21:22.157
that we've learned in this
competition.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.117
Does it normally
take you 45 minutes?

21:24.159 --> 21:26.494
No, it definitely takes like
a lot more than that.

21:26.536 --> 21:27.787
A lot longer?

21:27.829 --> 21:29.414
This is going to be a challenge

21:29.456 --> 21:31.791
because we have half the hands
that we normally do.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.418
So it's going to be
half the time.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.211
What are you using
the skin for over here?

21:35.253 --> 21:37.630
So I'm doing crispy
chicken skin as a garnish.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.424
I'm just going to throw
this in the oven.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.426
It's going to add like another
textural element to the dish.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.970
Two different styles, what are
the main cooking techniques

21:44.012 --> 21:45.638
of these two competitors?

21:45.680 --> 21:47.724
So, Kennedy cooks
with a lot of spice.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.893
She has Mexican heritage
in the family.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.395
But what we want always
from Kennedy and Rosie,

21:52.437 --> 21:54.105
take a chance.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.733
Anika and Anu sometimes their
dishes are not as precise,

21:56.775 --> 21:58.318
but it's always
flavorful and delicious.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.070
You're going to start this
immediately, right?

22:00.111 --> 22:02.364
You got to start this
chicken on the pot first.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.199
You already started the
rice right, is it boiling?

22:04.240 --> 22:06.409
If it's boiling turn it
down and put the lid on.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.952
It's not boiling yet.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.579
It's hard having to
stand outside of the ring.

22:09.621 --> 22:11.748
I'm just sitting there
freaking out, stressed,

22:11.790 --> 22:13.625
looking at what Anika's
doing I'm like,

22:13.667 --> 22:15.752
Let me get into the ring
and let me cook.

22:15.794 --> 22:17.462
- You want to switch out?
- Yeah.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.422
And there's the tag in.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.591
Here we go ladies and gentlemen!

22:24.636 --> 22:26.054
So with this challenge,

22:26.096 --> 22:27.681
we want to make
something different

22:27.722 --> 22:29.224
that the judges
haven't seen from us.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.059
We decided to make
a Thai chicken green curry

22:31.101 --> 22:32.894
and that's something I've
never made before.

22:32.936 --> 22:34.854
- Did you get lime leaves?
- Yes, I did.

22:34.896 --> 22:36.523
- Thai basil?
- Yes, I did.

22:36.564 --> 22:39.609
Come over here and
turn this up. Up, up, up, Yes.

22:39.651 --> 22:42.737
Now it's going to get going.
I'm proud of Kennedy.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.489
She wanted
to try something new

22:44.531 --> 22:47.158
and for Kennedy to recognize
that she needs growth.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.494
That's a huge deal for
anybody to admit that.

22:49.536 --> 22:50.912
- That good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

22:50.954 --> 22:52.288
Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.457
They're both doing chicken
right now.

22:54.499 --> 22:55.792
Oh, no.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.460
Out with the chicken thighs.

22:57.502 --> 22:58.962
That's a little scary.

22:59.004 --> 23:02.549
Sear that chicken, baby.
Sear that chicken.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.259
You go, Anu!

23:04.300 --> 23:06.720
Running in the Top Chef
Family Stylekitchen

23:06.761 --> 23:09.514
is the most exercise I've ever
gotten for the last--

23:09.556 --> 23:10.974
No, that's not true.

23:11.016 --> 23:12.517
Yes, from last so many years

23:12.559 --> 23:14.519
because I'm actually
a software engineer,

23:14.561 --> 23:17.313
so I'm working at my
desk the whole day.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.983
I have to really make
an effort to go and exercise.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.985
Let's go Anu.

23:22.027 --> 23:23.653
Out here in Top Chef
Family Stylekitchen

23:23.695 --> 23:26.031
running is a daily chore.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.535
30 minutes, guys, keep going.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.287
Swap me out, swap me out.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.044
- Salt and pepper.
- Salt and pepper.

23:39.085 --> 23:42.422
I hate this tag team challenge
for many reasons,

23:42.464 --> 23:45.091
but the biggest one is if
I'm in the kitchen,

23:45.133 --> 23:47.719
she's screaming at me
and she can't help me.

23:47.761 --> 23:49.346
Get the shallots out
for me to cut.

23:49.387 --> 23:52.015
And if she's in the kitchen,
I'm screaming at her.

23:52.057 --> 23:53.600
Swap me. Go, go, go, come one.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.185
Let's go.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.145
Stir it, stir it, stir it,
stir it Kennedy.

23:57.187 --> 23:58.730
So it's so much stress.

23:58.772 --> 24:00.607
Go Kennedy.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.110
Check on the chicken.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.697
- What is it?
- 165.

24:07.739 --> 24:09.407
Take it out, take it out,
take it out.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.493
I think you can get started on
the swiss chard,

24:11.534 --> 24:13.036
just chop them up

24:13.078 --> 24:15.330
You guys have 20
minutes left. Guys keep going

24:15.372 --> 24:17.374
Anika we need to do something
about the potatoes.

24:17.415 --> 24:18.917
They won't cook.
They are very big.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.543
Okay, I'll cut them smaller.

24:20.585 --> 24:22.587
I think we should cut down
on some of our things,

24:22.629 --> 24:25.048
but Anika is of the opinion
that, no, we can do it.

24:25.090 --> 24:26.966
Anika what do we
do with this, this is so--

24:27.008 --> 24:28.426
Okay, tag me, tag me.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.845
I think Anika always
has this big ideas,

24:30.887 --> 24:32.847
and even if there is
five minutes left,

24:32.889 --> 24:34.474
she wants to use that to
do something else.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.142
I'm going to try to
cut these smaller,

24:36.184 --> 24:37.644
even though they're already...

24:37.686 --> 24:39.437
Yeah, do that.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.147
Do you want the rice
going that fast?

24:41.189 --> 24:42.982
I don't know how to
turn it down.

24:43.024 --> 24:44.734
Swap me and I'll go
turn it down.

24:44.776 --> 24:48.238
You've got this, you got it,
you got it, yeah, oh tag her.

24:48.279 --> 24:51.074
One of my concerns
is the rice.

24:51.116 --> 24:52.826
Just because we're not allowed
to use the hotline,

24:52.867 --> 24:55.495
we have to use the burners that
we have at our station

24:55.537 --> 24:57.789
in the ring.
And I've never used those

24:57.831 --> 24:59.374
in this competition before

25:02.627 --> 25:05.755
Swap me, get in and look at it,
decide what you need to do.

25:08.133 --> 25:11.469
Check-- maybe
it just need to be steamed.

25:13.513 --> 25:14.597
Okay, you wanna switch?

25:15.890 --> 25:17.225
Come on Anika.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.811
- Go mom.
- 13 minutes.

25:21.021 --> 25:23.815
Okay I'm turning it off.
Let's just purée.

25:23.857 --> 25:27.444
Time is ticking and my potatoes
aren't cooking as fast

25:27.485 --> 25:28.987
as I would like them to.

25:29.029 --> 25:30.613
I just had to put them
in the ricer

25:30.655 --> 25:32.949
because I don't have enough time
to wait any longer.

25:32.991 --> 25:35.076
Yeah, that was a big mistake.

25:35.118 --> 25:37.537
Looking over at Kennedy
and Rosie's dish.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.539
I see what they have rice,
basil,

25:39.581 --> 25:41.624
oil, and green Thai curry,
and I'm thinking,

25:41.666 --> 25:45.128
maybe you have done something
a bit simpler for this round.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.214
Oh, my God,
this is so stressful.

25:48.256 --> 25:50.967
Is that the ricer thing?
Oh, my God.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.179
Did you check the rice?

25:55.263 --> 25:57.932
It's perfect,
I'm turning it off.

25:59.851 --> 26:01.394
That's so good.

26:01.436 --> 26:05.023
Six minutes, six minutes,
come on, come on, come on.

26:05.732 --> 26:10.403
Yeah, this potato,
is not working with me today.

26:10.445 --> 26:14.282
The potato, it's not cooked
enough to go through the ricer.

26:14.324 --> 26:16.159
So I decided I have
to scrap the purée

26:16.201 --> 26:18.370
and do something else.
Can you get some bread?

26:18.411 --> 26:20.163
And I can just toast
that really quick.

26:20.205 --> 26:22.624
There's no time for bread.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.669
You guys have to start plating.

26:25.710 --> 26:27.754
Anika you should start plating.

26:27.796 --> 26:29.381
Thank you.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.966
Scratch the bread.
Scratch the bread.

26:32.008 --> 26:34.469
I can't hear anything.

26:34.511 --> 26:37.972
The audience is roaring.
My competitors are giving me

26:38.014 --> 26:41.851
advice and so is my mom. I have
no idea who's saying what.

26:41.893 --> 26:43.645
I'm getting a bit flustered.

26:43.687 --> 26:45.605
The potatoes.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.023
Like, ah!

26:47.065 --> 26:48.983
Oh my gosh, open, holy crap.

26:49.025 --> 26:51.986
- You're guys are alright!
- You've got two minutes left.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.613
Come on, Kennedy.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.031
Two minutes left.

26:55.073 --> 26:57.409
I just want to lean over
and grab something

26:57.450 --> 26:59.411
or stir the chicken,
and I can't do anything.

26:59.452 --> 27:02.247
It's really hard
to be so helpless.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.290
Come on Kennedy,
less than two minutes.

27:04.332 --> 27:06.001
You still gotta do the
peppers and the limes.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.544
Stop yelling at me, please.

27:18.096 --> 27:20.056
Anika start plating.

27:20.098 --> 27:22.183
You got to plate.

27:22.225 --> 27:24.060
At one minute, 45 seconds,

27:24.102 --> 27:25.854
I need to start plating this,

27:25.895 --> 27:27.605
and I can forget
about the bread.

27:27.647 --> 27:29.441
Don't forget the skin
in the oven.

27:29.482 --> 27:32.694
Oh, thank you.
It feels a bit disappointing

27:32.736 --> 27:34.487
that we didn't get
any starch on the plate

27:34.529 --> 27:37.115
but I think judges like it
as it is as long as

27:37.157 --> 27:39.868
it's really, really,
really good.

27:39.909 --> 27:42.328
Go Anika, get everything
on the plate. Come on Kennedy.

27:42.370 --> 27:44.205
Get the peppers on.

27:44.247 --> 27:45.874
Somebody jump off the top rope.

27:45.915 --> 27:47.334
- Come on.
- Yes.

27:47.375 --> 27:48.710
Come on Kennedy.

27:48.752 --> 27:50.587
Another one, next one,
17 seconds.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.130
Just tiny drops, a couple drops.

27:52.172 --> 27:53.923
Stop stressing me out.

27:53.965 --> 27:57.927
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

27:57.969 --> 28:02.932
five, four, three, two, one.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.109
Damn.

28:13.151 --> 28:15.904
Kennedy and Rosie, tell us
about your tag team dish.

28:15.945 --> 28:18.573
Well, last challenge you said
I stayed in my comfort zone.

28:18.615 --> 28:21.576
So this dish is something
I haven't made before,

28:21.618 --> 28:24.412
so we made
a chicken green curry

28:24.454 --> 28:27.082
with a basil oil
and jasmine rice.

28:27.123 --> 28:28.708
We asked you to take a chance.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.794
We asked you to put yourself
out of your comfort zone

28:30.835 --> 28:33.004
and you totally stepped up.
Your knife skills

28:33.046 --> 28:35.965
are always on point.
I also like the texture

28:36.007 --> 28:38.593
you added in
with the different mushrooms

28:38.635 --> 28:42.430
and all the different beautiful
layers of built flavors.

28:42.472 --> 28:44.307
This isn't something I usually
would order

28:44.349 --> 28:45.850
on a menu,
but after a few bites,

28:45.892 --> 28:48.478
I would crush this entire thing.
So good.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.439
I'm at home with this dish
because my husband is Samoan,

28:51.481 --> 28:53.942
so he cooks a lot of
Polynesian dishes for me,

28:53.983 --> 28:56.611
and one of my favorites
is coconut rice.

28:56.653 --> 28:58.780
And I have the feel of that.

28:58.822 --> 29:01.324
But with the spices and
the peppers and then

29:01.366 --> 29:03.660
the texture from the
meat is phenomenal.

29:03.702 --> 29:06.037
I can't wait to put him on
this when I go home.

29:06.079 --> 29:07.414
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:07.455 --> 29:09.290
This is a restaurant
quality dish

29:09.332 --> 29:11.584
and another thing you nailed
was the rice.

29:11.626 --> 29:13.962
You know what you're doing,
so keep going. Don't stop.

29:14.004 --> 29:15.296
It is delicious.

29:15.338 --> 29:16.589
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:16.631 --> 29:18.758
Thank you Kennedy and Rosie.

29:21.636 --> 29:24.139
Anika and Anu, tell us about
your tag team dish.

29:24.180 --> 29:27.976
So we made chicken pipérade
with sautéed Swiss chard

29:28.018 --> 29:29.728
and crispy chicken skin.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.980
Your plating was absolutely
beautiful.

29:32.022 --> 29:36.484
The crackling of the skin on
top was great textural change.

29:36.526 --> 29:38.695
I love the Swiss chard.

29:38.737 --> 29:40.905
Was there anything that you
wanted to go different

29:40.947 --> 29:43.116
or did you execute the dish
that you wanted to do?

29:43.158 --> 29:44.868
I did want to do a potato purée.

29:44.909 --> 29:46.661
Saffron flavored.

29:46.703 --> 29:49.122
Yeah, so we started it a bit
late and it didn't go through

29:49.164 --> 29:52.000
the machine, so we just decided
not to put it on the plate.

29:52.042 --> 29:54.210
All honesty, I have a problem.

29:54.252 --> 29:56.838
The chicken is undercooked
on mine.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.340
Oh.

29:58.381 --> 30:00.008
I wish it would have cooked
a little bit more

30:00.050 --> 30:02.385
because I really want to
enjoy the entire dish.

30:02.427 --> 30:04.512
But I think you got
a little too complicated

30:04.554 --> 30:06.848
with the potatoes and doing
too many things.

30:06.890 --> 30:09.017
I think the clock got the
better of you in this one.

30:09.059 --> 30:11.936
I realized my mom only checked
one piece of chicken.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.481
I think I just checked the
smallest piece of chicken

30:14.522 --> 30:16.775
and that was done, but the
others were not done.

30:16.816 --> 30:19.527
So I'm very disappointed
in myself.

30:21.446 --> 30:23.698
- Thank you, Anika and Anu.
- Thank you.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.201
Okay, judges, it's time to vote
for the winning dish.

30:26.242 --> 30:31.039
Please cast your vote on
the scorecard and pass it to me.

30:32.248 --> 30:35.251
Ladies, gentlemen, and chefs,

30:35.293 --> 30:40.548
the winners of this Championship
tag team match are...

30:42.592 --> 30:48.723
Kennedy and Rosie,
the Alaskan Foodies!

30:48.765 --> 30:51.434
I'm just so happy that we
finally won a challenge

30:51.476 --> 30:53.561
because that
has been long awaited.

30:53.603 --> 30:55.980
Doing the tag team
is pretty intense.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.900
I realize that when push comes
to shove that we work

30:58.942 --> 31:02.779
good as a team, I'm proud of
her that she realized it was

31:02.821 --> 31:05.115
a team challenge, not just
Kennedy taking on this,

31:05.156 --> 31:06.408
you know, new dish by herself.

31:06.449 --> 31:09.119
Congratulations, Kennedy
and Rosie.

31:10.245 --> 31:13.790
You are the Top Chef Family
Stylekitchen champion.

31:15.625 --> 31:17.502
And not only that,

31:17.544 --> 31:21.339
you're also getting four
tickets to WrestleMania

31:21.381 --> 31:23.425
plus travel and accommodations.

31:23.466 --> 31:26.511
Oh, my gosh!

31:27.470 --> 31:29.681
It's like the gift that
keeps on giving.

31:29.723 --> 31:31.599
So now I'm even more excited
because I didn't know

31:31.641 --> 31:34.853
- we were going to win tickets.
- Oh yeah.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.774
Oh, they get their own belts!

31:39.816 --> 31:42.068
With the Championship
title that we won

31:42.110 --> 31:44.279
one day when I have my own
restaurant,

31:44.320 --> 31:47.615
it will be framed on the wall
so everyone can see it

31:47.657 --> 31:50.410
because we just won our first
elimination challenge.

31:50.452 --> 31:52.454
One for yourself.

31:53.246 --> 31:54.789
Over the shoulder.

32:01.421 --> 32:04.966
Yeah Kennedy! Yeah Rosie!

32:05.008 --> 32:07.344
Let's go. I love it.

32:07.385 --> 32:08.511
Get it.

32:08.553 --> 32:10.013
If you keep cooking like this,

32:10.055 --> 32:11.848
you're going to win many, many
more challenges.

32:11.890 --> 32:14.309
Don't stop. Keep going.
It's delicious.

32:14.351 --> 32:15.727
Next up, it's time for

32:15.769 --> 32:18.188
the Signature Move
elimination match.

32:24.277 --> 32:29.199
Kaj and Liz, Jack and Bobbie,
it all comes down to this.

32:29.991 --> 32:34.245
Chefs, all WWE superstars
have a signature move

32:34.287 --> 32:35.747
and we want to see yours.

32:35.789 --> 32:37.290
Just like in wrestling,

32:37.332 --> 32:39.584
your signature move
is a thing you're best at,

32:39.626 --> 32:42.212
whether it's a technique,
an ingredient or a dish.

32:42.629 --> 32:44.964
Okay, chefs, you may
enter the ring.

32:47.592 --> 32:49.469
For the final bout of the night.

32:49.511 --> 32:52.555
The Signature Move
Elimination Match.

32:52.597 --> 32:54.683
Jack and Bobbie.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.811
I have to go up against Kaj,

32:57.852 --> 32:59.229
who's like one of
my best friends

32:59.270 --> 33:01.272
and one of us is going
to go home today.

33:01.314 --> 33:02.816
It's a lot of dang pressure

33:02.857 --> 33:05.485
and their competitors
Kaj and Liz.

33:08.321 --> 33:11.491
We've done this before,
and we'll do it again.

33:12.492 --> 33:13.993
We're not going home.

33:14.869 --> 33:16.621
You guys ready to cook
for your lives?

33:16.663 --> 33:20.125
- Yeah.
- Your time starts now.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.965
Maybe like a Korean play
on steak and eggs

33:27.007 --> 33:29.592
Like the gochujang sauce
and the Korean dry rub.

33:29.634 --> 33:31.052
How many chicken thighs
did you get?

33:31.094 --> 33:33.763
- I got like nine.
- In an elimination round

33:33.805 --> 33:35.515
what should they be focusing on?

33:35.557 --> 33:38.476
You have to pull your bag of
tricks and put it on a table.

33:38.518 --> 33:40.437
This is all in or you're out.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.650
Let's go.

33:45.692 --> 33:47.986
We're doing rice cake,
sunny side up egg,

33:48.028 --> 33:49.946
a steak, and a gochujang sauce.

33:49.988 --> 33:51.948
Ooh, I love gochujang sauce.

33:51.990 --> 33:54.284
I think it's like a Korean
steak and eggs.

33:54.325 --> 33:55.618
It's going to be spicy.

33:55.660 --> 33:57.495
Gonna have a fresh pickle
on there

33:57.537 --> 33:59.289
Is spicy your signature move?

33:59.330 --> 34:01.958
- Yeah, we like spice.
- I can tell.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.710
So far in the
competition we've been

34:03.752 --> 34:06.880
bringing the judges heat
in the form of cayenne

34:06.921 --> 34:08.673
and more cajun style spices.

34:08.715 --> 34:10.925
Cut that bag, rip it open.

34:10.967 --> 34:12.719
So we're going to go to Korea,

34:12.761 --> 34:14.262
we're going to go
around the world

34:14.304 --> 34:16.014
and do something
completely different.

34:16.056 --> 34:17.891
We don't cook a lot Korean
food, but it's like--

34:17.932 --> 34:20.518
Go big or go home
and we're gonna go big.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.228
I like that mentality.

34:22.270 --> 34:24.314
I think it's
steak and eggs, Kajified.

34:24.356 --> 34:25.815
Kajified, yeah.

34:25.857 --> 34:27.817
Okay, are you,
you need a big bowl

34:27.859 --> 34:29.527
- for your flour dredge?
- Yeah.

34:29.569 --> 34:34.032
My signature move in the kitchen
is my southwestern fried chicken

34:34.074 --> 34:38.411
with miso mashed potato and
garlic onion collard greens.

34:38.453 --> 34:40.789
We got some garlic, some cumin.

34:40.830 --> 34:43.375
Smoked paprika, some cayenne.

34:43.416 --> 34:46.086
Would you say that that's your
signature ingredient?

34:46.127 --> 34:48.171
Yeah, I would say,
I call it the Cayenne punch.

34:48.213 --> 34:50.382
I've only done the chicken
in a sandwich form,

34:50.423 --> 34:52.717
so making it on a plate
is a whole new game plan.

34:52.759 --> 34:54.302
Oh, I like that, Jack.

34:54.344 --> 34:57.222
Oh yeah.
Test the ropes, test the ropes.

34:57.263 --> 34:59.766
But I'm here to prove
that fried chicken can be

34:59.808 --> 35:03.228
- like five star amazing.
- You make this a lot?

35:03.269 --> 35:05.563
Yeah, my brother loves
this fried chicken recipe,

35:05.605 --> 35:07.232
so I love making it for him.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.818
Onions, garlic, okay,
cause they need to be separate.

35:10.276 --> 35:14.155
Need to get the sushi
rice vinegar heated.

35:14.197 --> 35:15.824
Can we use your burner
for a quick second?

35:15.865 --> 35:17.242
Yeah, yeah.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.285
The most stressful thing
about cooking

35:19.327 --> 35:22.497
in the ring is that we only
have two burners.

35:22.539 --> 35:25.500
That is a real constraint.
Can you get that going for me?

35:25.542 --> 35:27.085
We have to cook steaks,

35:27.127 --> 35:29.921
we have to cook rice cakes,
and we have to cook eggs

35:29.963 --> 35:31.923
and we have to do it
in a certain order.

35:31.965 --> 35:33.717
This is a very technical dish

35:33.758 --> 35:36.136
and we just don't have
any wiggle room.

35:37.053 --> 35:40.682
30 minutes left.
Come on, guys, you got this.

35:44.060 --> 35:47.772
Look at the moves.
Stir it, yeah, stir it.

35:47.814 --> 35:49.774
Whip it Kaj.

35:49.816 --> 35:52.277
I know from watching
Anika and Anu

35:52.318 --> 35:54.738
that when you let
people get inside of your head

35:54.779 --> 35:56.114
it messes with your flow.

35:56.156 --> 35:57.991
Show that beef who's boss.

35:58.033 --> 36:00.201
And we really just need to keep
our head down and cook

36:00.243 --> 36:03.788
the best we can and box
out everyone else.

36:07.876 --> 36:10.045
See if you can get
black sesame seeds out of--

36:10.086 --> 36:11.880
I don't know if they're there.

36:11.921 --> 36:13.590
Does it need more salt?
What does it need?

36:13.631 --> 36:14.841
Yup.

36:16.176 --> 36:17.719
Miso too.

36:17.761 --> 36:21.306
We're adding miso
to the sweet potatoes

36:21.348 --> 36:23.308
to just calm a little bit
of the sweetness down.

36:23.350 --> 36:26.728
The miso adds
a nice savory flavor.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.147
Jack that's good?

36:29.189 --> 36:31.941
- Tastes like a pretzel.
- Oh, yummy.

36:31.983 --> 36:34.694
Like a butter pretzel
and fried chicken, like...

36:36.654 --> 36:38.323
Hot pan behind.

36:38.365 --> 36:40.408
Seven minutes, Liz.
Alright I'm gonna go egg now.

36:42.118 --> 36:45.038
Break an egg. Go ahead.
Break an egg.

36:45.080 --> 36:48.541
- Yeah, use that wok!
Yeah!

36:48.583 --> 36:50.835
- Oh yeah, yeah!
- Oh yeah!

36:50.877 --> 36:54.464
Sprinkle it! Sprinkle it! Oh!

36:54.506 --> 36:57.384
It is actually a lot of fun
having everybody cheering

36:57.425 --> 36:59.928
on the sidelines because
we've become so close

36:59.969 --> 37:01.971
and so tight.
They're like family.

37:02.013 --> 37:03.556
Oh, he goes into the fryer.

37:03.598 --> 37:06.810
We are nailing every single
element of our dish.

37:06.851 --> 37:09.270
Some garlic in there or no?

37:09.312 --> 37:10.730
Four minutes.

37:12.315 --> 37:15.110
Throw it in the oven, guys.
Don't want undercooked chicken.

37:18.029 --> 37:20.073
- Ooh Liz.
- Woo hoo.

37:20.115 --> 37:22.200
What is this?
I think it is rice.

37:22.242 --> 37:23.535
They love rice around here.

37:23.576 --> 37:24.953
One more time.

37:24.994 --> 37:26.287
Looks good though.

37:26.579 --> 37:28.123
Woo.

37:28.164 --> 37:30.291
Feeling really good because
our dish is perfect

37:30.333 --> 37:33.545
and I'm giving up a slice
of me to the judges.

37:37.090 --> 37:39.300
The thing about this dish is
it's made or broken

37:39.342 --> 37:41.886
in the last two and a half
minutes of plating.

37:41.928 --> 37:43.471
Nice. Nice.

37:43.513 --> 37:45.015
Looks good.

37:45.056 --> 37:51.813
Seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one.

37:54.774 --> 37:56.276
I'd eat that.

37:56.317 --> 37:57.444
Beautiful.

37:57.485 --> 37:58.653
Nice job.

38:02.115 --> 38:03.950
Dinner's ready.

38:05.618 --> 38:06.911
There we go.

38:06.953 --> 38:08.830
Don't mind if I do, my friend.

38:09.789 --> 38:11.249
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

38:11.291 --> 38:12.751
Jack and Bobbie, Kaj and Liz,

38:12.792 --> 38:14.169
We asked you to make a dish

38:14.210 --> 38:15.920
highlighting
your signature move

38:15.962 --> 38:19.466
and you fought to the end. But
one of you will be sent home.

38:29.267 --> 38:31.686
Jack and Bobbie, what is
your signature move?

38:31.728 --> 38:35.231
Our signature move is that we
added some adobo chili.

38:35.273 --> 38:37.359
It's like the adobo chili punch

38:37.400 --> 38:39.277
I also added some cayenne
in the buttermilk,

38:39.319 --> 38:40.987
which is the Cayenne punch.

38:41.029 --> 38:45.450
So it adds some little bit
of heat to it, also qwispy.

38:45.492 --> 38:48.370
qwispy with a Q,
qwispy fried chicken

38:48.411 --> 38:52.123
with a miso mashed potato
and a red wine collard green.

38:52.165 --> 38:53.541
And honey chipotle drizzle.

38:53.583 --> 38:55.627
And honey chipotle drizzle,
sorry.

38:56.378 --> 38:59.255
The crunchiness of the chicken
is amazing,

38:59.297 --> 39:02.425
the creaminess of the miso
potatoes amazing,

39:02.467 --> 39:04.302
outside the box thinking there,

39:04.344 --> 39:06.054
How do you make the sauce?

39:06.096 --> 39:07.472
It is an adobo sauce with honey,

39:07.514 --> 39:09.307
olive oil, and orange juice.

39:09.349 --> 39:10.725
It's very delicious.

39:10.767 --> 39:12.727
The mashed potatoes,
they were airy.

39:12.769 --> 39:15.647
It just goes so well with
everything on the plate.

39:15.689 --> 39:19.484
I love the heat. I think maybe
a touch too much sweet.

39:19.526 --> 39:22.654
I'm opposite of you. I don't
want heat. I want sweet.

39:22.696 --> 39:24.489
And it was the perfect
amount for me.

39:24.531 --> 39:26.324
- Are you kidding me?
- Look at this.

39:26.366 --> 39:28.827
Are you kidding me?
I'll definitely go.

39:30.286 --> 39:32.455
My wife always tells
me to slow down,

39:32.497 --> 39:35.500
but when I'm eating really good
food, I can't help it.

39:35.542 --> 39:37.669
I just inhale it. Very good job.

39:37.711 --> 39:39.295
Thank you so much.

39:39.337 --> 39:41.798
The chicken is crisp,
the mashed potato is soft,

39:41.840 --> 39:44.342
and then you're adding that
beautiful miso twist.

39:44.384 --> 39:47.554
You should be very proud of
this dish. Good job, Bobbie.

39:47.595 --> 39:49.597
- Thank you, chef.
- Good job, Jack.

39:56.896 --> 39:59.190
Kaj and Liz, what is
your signature move

39:59.232 --> 40:00.650
and what dish did you make?

40:00.692 --> 40:03.069
Our signature move
is steak and heat

40:03.111 --> 40:06.322
because I really like cooking
steak and I use a lot of heat,

40:06.364 --> 40:08.491
so we wanted to go around

40:08.533 --> 40:10.368
the world to bring
you Korean heat.

40:10.410 --> 40:12.370
So we made a rice cake

40:12.412 --> 40:14.497
with a New York strip steak
sautéed shitakes,

40:14.539 --> 40:18.251
with ginger and garlic, a
gochujang sauce and a fried egg.

40:18.293 --> 40:20.545
I'm just blown away
by the complexity.

40:20.587 --> 40:22.380
Like, I couldn't have
made this at your age

40:22.422 --> 40:23.923
and I can't make it now.

40:23.965 --> 40:26.176
I love the meat, and the egg,
and the mushroom.

40:26.217 --> 40:28.178
- It's really creative.
- Thank you.

40:28.219 --> 40:30.805
You have some explosive
great flavor here.

40:30.847 --> 40:34.351
The crispiness on the rice cake.
The steak is cooked perfectly.

40:34.392 --> 40:37.187
You pickled the radish, which
I thought was incredible.

40:37.228 --> 40:38.521
Have you made this dish before?

40:38.563 --> 40:40.315
- No, no.
- This is your first time?

40:40.357 --> 40:42.359
- Yeah.
- It's really good.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.860
The Miz, what did you think?

40:43.902 --> 40:45.695
I ate the whole thing.
That's what I think.

40:45.737 --> 40:48.990
I ate the whole thing. I wasn't
sure how to eat it.

40:49.032 --> 40:51.618
But then when I stirred it
all together, I was like,

40:51.659 --> 40:53.995
There's a little spice.
There's a little sweetness.

40:54.037 --> 40:55.663
Now I get it.

40:55.705 --> 40:56.998
You're learning.

40:57.040 --> 40:58.375
I'm learning stuff here.

40:58.416 --> 41:00.085
And it was phenomenal.

41:00.126 --> 41:02.796
Umami,
salt, sour, sweet, and heat.

41:02.837 --> 41:05.674
All of that in this dish
and good for you

41:05.715 --> 41:10.387
for trying something different.
Whatever happens. Well done.

41:10.762 --> 41:11.930
Thank you.

41:11.971 --> 41:13.223
Yeah, Kaj and Liz.

41:16.142 --> 41:18.520
Fantastic job you all,
by the way.

41:18.561 --> 41:22.148
Blew my mind this entire time.
So thank you.

41:23.149 --> 41:25.944
Okay, judges, it's time to vote.

41:25.985 --> 41:28.238
This is gnarly.

41:28.947 --> 41:30.573
This is so hard.

41:30.615 --> 41:31.908
So hard.

41:31.950 --> 41:33.451
Jesus.

41:36.162 --> 41:39.082
Jack and Bobbie, Kaj and Liz,

41:39.124 --> 41:41.251
you really rose to the occasion.

41:41.292 --> 41:42.961
You're true fighters,
you're true chefs

41:43.003 --> 41:45.672
and the future is bright
because chefs like you.

41:46.464 --> 41:49.259
The votes are in.
The chefs with the lowest score

41:49.300 --> 41:51.845
who will be going home, are...

41:54.931 --> 41:57.434
Oh, I hate this.

42:00.812 --> 42:04.232
Jack and Bobbie, I'm sorry.
Time to pack your knives and go.

42:04.274 --> 42:06.651
I did not see that coming.

42:08.028 --> 42:11.322
- Oh, my God.
- Good job.

42:11.364 --> 42:13.491
Jack that was my favorite
meal you ever made.

42:13.908 --> 42:15.869
It was my favorite meal
you ever made,

42:15.910 --> 42:16.953
and you're incredible.

42:16.995 --> 42:18.288
You're incredible Jack.

42:18.329 --> 42:20.081
And you know how
incredible you are.

42:20.123 --> 42:23.251
It's alright Jack! Come on Jack!
Keep your head up, let's go!

42:23.293 --> 42:25.170
I hate this, I hate this.

42:26.171 --> 42:27.797
You're amazing.

42:28.256 --> 42:30.342
Just keep cooking buddy.

42:33.511 --> 42:35.347
We executed perfect.

42:36.681 --> 42:39.559
Kaj and Liz, Jack and Bobbie,
you may exit the ring,

42:39.601 --> 42:41.061
thank you so, so much.

42:41.102 --> 42:42.520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

42:44.064 --> 42:45.940
Oh it's alright.

42:46.858 --> 42:48.234
Ooh, this one hurt.

42:48.276 --> 42:49.903
I'm not having fun anymore.

42:52.739 --> 42:54.741
This whole competition,
you done been the man,

42:54.783 --> 42:56.743
you have been strong, keep
rocking, you understand?

42:56.785 --> 42:59.496
Yeah. I'm definitely
kind of sad.

42:59.537 --> 43:01.456
But in the back of my head,
I'm proud of myself.

43:01.498 --> 43:06.753
I completed half of Top Chef
Family Styleand that's crazy.

43:09.964 --> 43:12.175
Hell of a ride.
Throughout this experience,

43:12.217 --> 43:15.887
my mom put me through everything
and I'm grateful for that.

43:15.929 --> 43:17.847
Aw, you're so sweet.

43:17.889 --> 43:22.394
Now that I know the depth of
his knowledge as a chef,

43:22.435 --> 43:24.562
I can't wait to see
what he does.

43:24.604 --> 43:26.398
This is not the last

43:26.439 --> 43:28.858
they are going to see of me.
I'm not done.

43:28.900 --> 43:31.736
We all know that.

43:34.406 --> 43:36.866
Next, on Top Chef Family Style.

43:38.451 --> 43:40.787
Happy Halloween, chefs.

43:45.583 --> 43:48.128
For your elimination challenge
you'll cook in costume.

43:48.169 --> 43:49.504
You don't like the owl?

43:49.546 --> 43:51.131
As you create a spooky dish

43:51.172 --> 43:54.509
that pairs well with exactly
what you're wearing.

43:54.551 --> 43:56.386
I can't even, I can't.

43:56.428 --> 43:58.346
I just have to think
like a vampire

43:58.388 --> 43:59.931
and suck it up right now.

43:59.973 --> 44:01.725
Happy Halloween everyone.

44:01.766 --> 44:03.226
The sauce!

44:03.268 --> 44:04.936
The sauce, ah!

44:05.520 --> 44:09.983
One of the judges plates
didn't get the full sauce.

44:10.025 --> 44:11.359
Think that's okay?

44:11.401 --> 44:12.777
That looks like blood.

44:12.819 --> 44:13.862
Wait, what?
