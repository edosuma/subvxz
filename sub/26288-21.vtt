00:02.100 --> 00:03.172
Okay, I'm being headhunted.

00:03.173 --> 00:07.178
You're gonna leave NCIS for a
sexy, multimillion dollar job

00:07.179 --> 00:09.810
<i>at one of the coolest</i>
<i>tech companies in the world.</i>

00:09.811 --> 00:12.845
- Come back to bed and warm me up.
- I like the way you think.

00:12.914 --> 00:14.614
I'll get this back
to him tonight.

00:14.683 --> 00:16.783
Then your assignment is over.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.685
End the relationship
immediately.

00:18.753 --> 00:19.919
Then your assignment is over.

00:19.988 --> 00:22.855
End the relationship
immediately.

00:22.924 --> 00:24.490
Your gift
was a recording device.

00:24.559 --> 00:26.060
All right, this stops now.

00:26.084 --> 00:27.828
This is an off-the-books
account.

00:27.829 --> 00:29.162
That's a quarter-billion dollar

00:29.230 --> 00:31.197
slush fund with zero
accountability.

00:31.266 --> 00:33.332
- You traced the account.
- Whose is it?

00:33.401 --> 00:34.767
Your boss.

00:34.836 --> 00:37.537
What's the United States
Secretary of Defense

00:37.605 --> 00:39.639
doing with a quarter
of a billion dollars

00:39.708 --> 00:41.040

01:18.146 --> 01:19.812
I'm getting a Klowny Kake bar.

01:19.881 --> 01:20.913
I'll pay you back.

01:20.982 --> 01:22.849
That's coming out
of your allowance, bud.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.317
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.152
Hey, numbnuts.

01:26.221 --> 01:27.520
If you get ice cream,

01:27.589 --> 01:29.188
I get the Nintendo!

01:29.257 --> 01:30.656
Uh, Klowny Kake bar, please.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.926
Thanks.

01:35.997 --> 01:38.164
Ooh.

01:38.233 --> 01:39.899
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:42.737 --> 01:44.036
Okay, you two.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.906
It's been three hours,
enough is enough.

01:46.975 --> 01:48.875
Those video games
will rot your brain.

01:50.745 --> 01:52.745
Hey, late to dinner
means no dinner.

01:55.617 --> 01:58.251
Jen. Your mom made roast.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.754
- Where's your brother?
-Lying down.

02:01.823 --> 02:03.856
Says he didn't feel good.
Back there.

02:06.795 --> 02:09.195
Hey, bud, time to get up.

02:13.368 --> 02:14.767
Tommy!

02:19.474 --> 02:21.274
- What's wrong?
- Oh, my God.

02:21.342 --> 02:24.243
Stay back, honey.
Stay back.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.280

Hey, Kase.

03:08.823 --> 03:10.957
You ready for court?

03:11.025 --> 03:13.826
Sorry, uh, I didn't realize
you were praying.

03:13.895 --> 03:16.262
To the "Most Wanted" wall?
I wasn't.

03:16.331 --> 03:17.889
Unless you think
that would help.

03:17.913 --> 03:19.333
Help with what?

03:19.334 --> 03:20.967
Oh, my nerves.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.002
I could really do without
this part of the job.

03:23.071 --> 03:25.371
Oh, well, testifying's
kind of important.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.139
You know, I
dedicate my weekends

03:27.208 --> 03:28.875
to a federal initiative to get

03:28.943 --> 03:31.143
cold-case DNA into the system

03:31.212 --> 03:34.180
and this is what I get?
You mean... justice?

03:34.249 --> 03:36.515
When you say it like that,
I sound a little selfish.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.584
Mm.

03:37.619 --> 03:39.285
I mean, after two months
of rebuilding

03:39.354 --> 03:41.320
a 30-year-old murder case,

03:41.389 --> 03:43.990
the man who poisoned a box
of ice cream bars is finally

03:44.058 --> 03:46.692
going to prison. Doesn't that
help your nerves a little bit?

03:46.761 --> 03:48.294
It makes them worse.

03:48.363 --> 03:50.329
Just so much pressure
to say the right thing

03:50.398 --> 03:51.964
in the right way.

03:52.033 --> 03:54.200
We may not be on trial, but...

03:54.269 --> 03:55.469
we're definitely being judged.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.737
Intense, but courtrooms
are designed to be intimidating.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.972
That's why you got to
go in guilt-free, baby.

04:01.542 --> 04:05.544
Which is why I go to confession
the morning I testify.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.146
Really? What are you
guilty about?

04:07.215 --> 04:08.915
Nothing now. Clean slate.

04:08.983 --> 04:11.350
See, the jury, they sense

04:11.419 --> 04:13.586
a good guy, trustworthy.
That's all that matters.

04:13.655 --> 04:15.221
Yeah, and evidence.

04:15.290 --> 04:18.591
Evidence is a given,
but charm,

04:18.660 --> 04:21.093
well, charm is a gift.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.362
That's why the prosecutor
will choose me to testify

04:23.431 --> 04:25.531
and you to work the
pictures on the easel.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.500
Excuse me?

04:27.568 --> 04:30.047
Well, somebody's got to work the
easel, and it ain't gonna be me.

04:30.071 --> 04:32.538
- Okay, 20 bucks.
- It's a bet.

04:32.607 --> 04:33.706
Okay.

04:33.775 --> 04:35.775
Well, I can see
this is no longer about me.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.109
You'll be fine.

04:37.178 --> 04:39.545
We will all
be fine. Right?

04:39.614 --> 04:42.214
Counselor Hutchins, yes,

04:42.283 --> 04:46.052
I got enough "fine"
for all of us.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.853
I don't know what that means,

04:47.922 --> 04:50.122
but we have been over
everyone's testimony,

04:50.191 --> 04:54.727
and if we present this case in
a calm, orderly fashion, we win.

04:54.796 --> 04:56.028
It's not about winning.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.631
It's about justice.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.734
Which is the whole reason my
office moved up this court date.

05:01.803 --> 05:03.035
Yeah, twice.

05:03.104 --> 05:05.538
The sooner Stuart Crum
goes to prison, the better.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.313
Are you okay, Kase?

05:07.314 --> 05:09.075
Nope.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.410
- Not even in the slightest.
- Good.

05:12.647 --> 05:14.080
Keeps you sharp.

05:17.485 --> 05:21.454
Well, you all have been
thoroughly unhelpful.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.275
Where is McGee
when you need him?

05:23.299 --> 05:24.558
Personal days.

05:24.559 --> 05:26.092
With his wife
and kids.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.560
Again, when you
say it like that,

05:27.628 --> 05:28.995
I sound a little selfish.

05:40.308 --> 05:41.974
Agent McGee,

05:42.043 --> 05:43.843
welcome to Cali,
and welcome to

05:43.911 --> 05:46.345
the splendiferous world
of Splendifida headquarters.

05:46.414 --> 05:49.015
My name is Clarissa. I'm with
HR, and I'll be your tour guide

05:49.083 --> 05:50.627
during your visit.
- Very nice to meet you.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.018
We were so glad
to get your call,

05:52.086 --> 05:54.520
and so glad you're still
considering our job offer.

05:54.589 --> 05:55.821
Oh, yeah.

05:55.890 --> 05:58.357
"Information Requests Liaison."

05:58.426 --> 06:00.026
It's cooler than it sounds.

06:00.094 --> 06:02.628
As a leading provider
of technology devices

06:02.697 --> 06:05.031
and Internet data services,
we handle upwards

06:05.099 --> 06:07.933
of 60,000 data requests
and warrants

06:08.002 --> 06:09.635
from law enforcement
each year.

06:09.704 --> 06:11.437
NCIS was one of them.

06:11.506 --> 06:13.539
Exactly, so who better to lead

06:13.608 --> 06:15.975
our entire division than
a former federal agent?

06:16.044 --> 06:18.878
Well, I don't know
about "former" yet.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.147
Now, before I make my
final decision, I wanted to

06:21.215 --> 06:22.648
spend a couple days
here, you know,

06:22.717 --> 06:24.884
see what this place is about.
- Splendiferous.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.992
We already have your signed
nondisclosure agreement,

06:27.021 --> 06:29.455
so the only thing left to do
is to give you this.

06:29.524 --> 06:31.557
This lanyard is
enabled with our

06:31.626 --> 06:33.025
"Mary Beth" voice assistant.

06:33.094 --> 06:34.660
Anything you need,
just ask.

06:34.729 --> 06:37.229
- Mary Beth, say hello.
- Hello,

06:37.298 --> 06:38.998
NCIS Agent
Timothy Farragut McGee.

06:39.067 --> 06:40.199
Wow.

06:40.268 --> 06:43.069
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, specific.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.004
Um, listen,
if it's okay with you,

06:45.073 --> 06:46.872
I'd rather not wear
Mary Beth around my neck.

06:46.941 --> 06:48.841
Everybody has a Mary Beth.

06:48.910 --> 06:52.578
Nothing personal. I'm just,
I'm not a big fan of-of gadgets

06:52.647 --> 06:54.880
that are always
listening and watching.

06:54.949 --> 06:57.349
"Splendifida does not record,
review or compile consumer data

06:57.418 --> 06:58.551
without express consent."

06:58.619 --> 07:00.586
Not to mention,
this lanyard

07:00.621 --> 07:02.755
opens doors,
pays for lunch,

07:02.824 --> 07:06.559
pretty much gives you access
to everything we have to offer.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.394
Agent McGee, think of Mary Beth

07:08.463 --> 07:11.597
as your own personal
Splendifida "cheat code."

07:11.666 --> 07:14.500
Well, in that case...

07:14.569 --> 07:16.035
Up, up, down, down,

07:16.104 --> 07:18.537
left, right, left, right,
B, A, select, start.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.207
Unlimited lives granted!
Let's go.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.608
All right.

07:23.678 --> 07:25.111
<i>All rise.</i>

07:26.848 --> 07:28.547
Hear ye, hear ye.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.282
This court is now in session.

07:30.351 --> 07:32.551
The Honorable Judge
Miles Deakin presiding.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.752
Thank you.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.455
You may be seated.

07:40.328 --> 07:42.228
Our killer got dressed up today.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.530
Mm, you think he went
to confession, too?

07:44.599 --> 07:48.067
Some sins are unforgivable.

07:48.136 --> 07:50.469
Before we begin, I understand

07:50.538 --> 07:52.771
the defense has a request.

07:54.342 --> 07:55.708
Uh, Your Honor,

07:55.776 --> 07:59.645
given the history
of this case,

07:59.714 --> 08:02.248
uh, media attention
has gotten out of hand.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.049
Due to the
crowds outside

08:04.118 --> 08:06.986
of the building,
my client, Mr. Crum,

08:07.054 --> 08:09.655
is asking for
a private entrance

08:09.724 --> 08:11.657
so as to avoid any
undue harassment.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.260
Order.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.961
Are you kidding me?

08:16.030 --> 08:17.730
Order. Order.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.733
Mr. Madson, are you serious?

08:20.801 --> 08:22.635
It seems so, Your Honor.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.273
My client would like

08:27.341 --> 08:29.675
to remind the court
that he does have rights.

08:29.744 --> 08:31.944
What about my son?

08:32.013 --> 08:34.847
Tommy had rights, too!

08:34.916 --> 08:36.849
- Order.
- He had rights,

08:36.918 --> 08:38.116
and you killed my boy!

08:38.186 --> 08:39.318
Murderer!

08:39.386 --> 08:40.452
Order in the court!

08:40.520 --> 08:42.121
You murderer!

08:42.190 --> 08:43.880
Bailiff, I want that man
removed from my courtroom!

08:46.027 --> 08:46.959
- Let's go.
- Murderer!

08:47.028 --> 08:49.328
My son deserves justice!

08:49.397 --> 08:51.530
You murderer!

08:53.167 --> 08:55.301
Murderer!

09:00.868 --> 09:03.735
I'm so sorry, Agent Gibbs.

09:03.804 --> 09:06.471
This whole thing
has reopened some old wounds.

09:07.108 --> 09:10.877
Yeah, well,
some never heal.

09:10.945 --> 09:13.079
Do you have kids?

09:15.683 --> 09:17.617
Had a daughter.

09:17.685 --> 09:20.219
How long ago?

09:20.288 --> 09:23.256
About the same as you.

09:23.324 --> 09:24.657
30 years

09:24.726 --> 09:28.494
is a long time to bleed.

09:30.632 --> 09:34.300
So the judge
kicked me out?

09:34.369 --> 09:38.271
Yeah, and you're lucky it
wasn't contempt or a mistrial.

09:40.008 --> 09:43.576
Your people, NCIS,
will get justice for Tommy?

09:45.046 --> 09:46.979
Not just for him.

09:50.151 --> 09:51.684
So, Agent Bishop,

09:51.753 --> 09:54.086
we are here today
because of

09:54.155 --> 09:55.421
a federal initiative to get

09:55.490 --> 09:57.190
cold-case DNA
into modern systems.

09:59.027 --> 10:01.627
DNA which produced a match
to the defendant,

10:01.696 --> 10:04.764
Stuart Crum. Is that correct?

10:04.833 --> 10:07.099
Yes. If you'll look
to Exhibit A.

10:07.168 --> 10:08.467
The so-called

10:08.536 --> 10:10.995
"1989 Ice Cream
Murder."

10:10.996 --> 10:12.896
Six Klowny Kake ice cream bars

10:12.965 --> 10:17.101
were partially cut open and
laced with strychnine poison.

10:17.169 --> 10:18.869
Five children
fell critically ill.

10:18.938 --> 10:22.107
And Thomas Larson
eventually died.

10:22.108 --> 10:24.942
Yes. It caused
a nationwide panic.

10:25.011 --> 10:28.012
Objection. How can Agent Bishop
speak to something that

10:28.081 --> 10:31.616
happened 30 years ago? Was this
witness even alive in 1989?

10:31.684 --> 10:33.284
Actually, I was.

10:33.353 --> 10:35.720
I was four years old,
and I vividly remember

10:35.789 --> 10:37.422
my father forbidding
me and my brothers

10:37.490 --> 10:39.090
from running out
to the ice cream truck.

10:39.159 --> 10:41.459
Still object, Counselor?

10:41.528 --> 10:42.894
Where did NCIS--

10:42.962 --> 10:45.263
then called N.I.S.--

10:45.331 --> 10:46.898
originally find the DNA?

10:46.966 --> 10:49.233
A hair follicle was found

10:49.302 --> 10:51.302
in one of the wrappers
of the poisoned

10:51.371 --> 10:52.848
ice cream bar,
but of course, there was

10:52.872 --> 10:54.806
no database back then.

10:54.874 --> 10:58.109
Now there is, and you get
a match to Mr. Crum.

10:58.178 --> 11:00.211
What happens next?

11:00.280 --> 11:02.380
Well, we interviewed witnesses,
pulled records,

11:02.449 --> 11:04.582
and we confronted Mr. Crum.

11:04.651 --> 11:06.417
And what did
Mr. Crum say?

11:06.486 --> 11:08.653
He confessed.
To everything.

11:10.056 --> 11:13.391
Thank you.
No further questions.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.793
Mr. Madson?
Agent Bishop...

11:15.862 --> 11:17.728
was Stuart Crum

11:17.797 --> 11:20.665
ever a suspect in 1989?

11:20.733 --> 11:25.903
No. Only in 2019,
after the DNA match.

11:25.972 --> 11:28.339
And during your interrogation,
did Mr. Crum appear

11:28.408 --> 11:32.076
anxious or scared?
- Yes.

11:32.145 --> 11:34.846
After Special Agents Gibbs
and Sloane laid out

11:34.914 --> 11:37.181
the mountain of evidence
against him.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.816
That's usually how it works.

11:38.885 --> 11:41.919
Ice cream?
I hate ice cream.

11:41.988 --> 11:43.254
Interesting, Stuart.

11:43.323 --> 11:44.689
So, how did your DNA

11:44.757 --> 11:47.959
get inside the wrapper
of a poisoned ice cream bar?

11:48.027 --> 11:49.794
What do you
want me to say, huh?

11:49.863 --> 11:52.663
- That I did it?
- Yeah. That works for us.

11:52.732 --> 11:56.934
I wanted those kids
to get sick, okay?

11:57.003 --> 12:01.873
But it was 30 years ago
and only one of the kids died.

12:04.177 --> 12:05.109
Agent Sloane,

12:05.178 --> 12:07.378
does Mr. Crum
appear at all

12:07.447 --> 12:09.847
remorseful to you?
- No.

12:09.916 --> 12:12.149
Thank you.

12:12.218 --> 12:15.152
Mr. Madson?
Agent Sloane...

12:15.221 --> 12:16.821
just because my client

12:16.890 --> 12:18.356
was an underpaid
truck driver,

12:18.424 --> 12:20.525
that makes him
a killer?

12:20.593 --> 12:25.630
At the time of the poisoning,
Mr. Crum was in a dead-end job.

12:25.698 --> 12:27.532
His wife had just left him

12:27.600 --> 12:28.799
for a Naval officer,

12:28.868 --> 12:31.235
and he was angry,

12:31.304 --> 12:33.538
alone and seemingly powerless
over life in general.

12:33.606 --> 12:34.872
In your opinion.

12:34.941 --> 12:37.008
In my professional opinion.

12:37.076 --> 12:39.944
He wanted to
reassert himself.

12:39.979 --> 12:43.147
So he took industrial rat poison

12:43.216 --> 12:44.982
from his workplace,
and used it

12:45.051 --> 12:46.551
to create public panic.

12:46.619 --> 12:48.586
It made him feel good.

12:48.655 --> 12:50.021
In control.

12:50.089 --> 12:51.822
Like God.

12:51.891 --> 12:53.391
Do you know what this is?

12:53.459 --> 12:54.992
A blank piece of paper.

12:55.061 --> 12:57.895
This... is Mr. Crum's

12:57.964 --> 12:59.864
criminal record.
Because...

12:59.933 --> 13:01.232
he has none.

13:01.301 --> 13:03.434
He was a suspect in a robbery
two years ago.

13:03.503 --> 13:05.269
Mr. Crum was
never charged,

13:05.338 --> 13:08.239
and Maryland police issued
a full apology.

13:08.308 --> 13:10.408
Sociopaths love gratification.

13:10.476 --> 13:15.212
Agent Sloane, if my client
is the violent, cunning,

13:15.281 --> 13:18.215
and malicious killer
you accuse him of being,

13:18.284 --> 13:20.518
why is his life
a clean slate?

13:20.587 --> 13:22.186
Let me be clear.

13:22.255 --> 13:25.356
I do not think that Mr. Crum
is a serial killer.

13:26.693 --> 13:28.893
Thank you,
Agent Sloane.

13:28.962 --> 13:30.728
No further questions.

13:30.797 --> 13:33.197
For some killers,
once is enough.

13:48.047 --> 13:49.880
Officer Clark, come in.

13:49.949 --> 13:51.415
Director Vance.

13:51.484 --> 13:52.984
Is Gibbs joining us?

13:53.052 --> 13:54.452
No, he's in court.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.988
I don't like this.

13:57.056 --> 13:59.657
My coming to NCIS
draws attention.

13:59.726 --> 14:02.927
All due respect, Director,
it's been weeks

14:02.996 --> 14:05.463
since I came to you and
Gibbs asking for help.

14:05.531 --> 14:07.064
And now, there's nothing.

14:07.133 --> 14:08.633
This is my job.

14:08.701 --> 14:11.168
Maybe even my life
that's on the line with this.

14:11.237 --> 14:12.637
I'm well aware.

14:12.705 --> 14:14.138
There's $250 million

14:14.207 --> 14:16.073
sitting in an offshore account
in the Caymans.

14:16.142 --> 14:18.009
- I remember.
- And no one knows

14:18.077 --> 14:19.321
who's using it
because the only name

14:19.345 --> 14:21.512
associated with it
is the United States

14:21.581 --> 14:22.980
Secretary of Defense.

14:23.049 --> 14:24.482
This goes right
to the top.

14:24.550 --> 14:27.485
And we can't exactly
go straight to SecDef, can we?

14:27.553 --> 14:28.919
No, sir.

14:28.988 --> 14:30.421
Or pull
Pentagon records,

14:30.490 --> 14:33.257
or even breathe in the general
direction of that account

14:33.326 --> 14:35.459
until we know more,
Officer Clark.

14:35.528 --> 14:37.762
So you've been
thinking about it.

14:37.830 --> 14:40.331
- More than thinking.
- So you have a plan?

14:40.400 --> 14:43.100
Last time we talked,
you called us the "good guys."

14:43.169 --> 14:45.102
Don't the good guys
always have a plan?

14:45.171 --> 14:48.939
We have an inside man
looking into account records

14:49.008 --> 14:51.676
via a back door as we speak.

14:51.744 --> 14:55.780
So... we're here,
Gibbs is in court...

14:55.848 --> 14:57.515
Where's this "inside man"?

14:57.583 --> 14:59.283
California.

14:59.352 --> 15:01.719
Oh... this is so nice.

15:01.788 --> 15:03.065
We've found that
frequent napping

15:03.089 --> 15:05.156
actually boosts productivity.

15:05.224 --> 15:07.158
Does NCIS have a break room?

15:09.762 --> 15:12.229
Three vending machines
and a microwave.

15:12.298 --> 15:15.066
Our 24-hour commissary offers
a wide variety

15:15.134 --> 15:17.201
of fresh produce
and made-to-order meals.

15:17.270 --> 15:18.703
I could get used to this.

15:18.771 --> 15:20.171
It's time for your visit

15:20.239 --> 15:21.872
to the consumer
electronics division.

15:21.941 --> 15:22.941
Ready to go?

15:22.975 --> 15:24.909
You know what?
I was, uh,

15:24.977 --> 15:26.210
I was actually hoping

15:26.279 --> 15:28.546
we could maybe tour
Government Cloud Services.

15:28.614 --> 15:30.381
Why?

15:30.450 --> 15:31.794
I mean, like most
major data players

15:31.818 --> 15:32.983
such as Amazon
and Google,

15:33.052 --> 15:35.019
we do have Pentagon contracts.

15:35.088 --> 15:37.421
But next to product R&D,

15:37.490 --> 15:40.524
U.I. development,
our self-driving car test track,

15:40.593 --> 15:43.060
an empty server room
feels pretty boring.

15:43.129 --> 15:45.029
Yeah. You know, I'm just--
I'm super curious

15:45.098 --> 15:48.099
to see what kind of zero-trust
model you implement.

15:48.167 --> 15:51.202
As you know,
perimeter-centric technologies

15:51.270 --> 15:53.337
are only half of InfoSec
these days.

15:53.406 --> 15:55.940
Of course. Right.

15:56.008 --> 15:57.341
Uh, I guess I could

15:57.410 --> 15:59.243
have Mary Beth add it
to tomorrow's events.

15:59.312 --> 16:00.911
That would be great.
Thank you.

16:00.980 --> 16:02.046
Done.

16:02.115 --> 16:04.215
- Shall we move on?
- Please, after you.

16:07.353 --> 16:08.686
<i>How reliable</i>

16:08.755 --> 16:10.921
was this DNA
evidence? I mean,

16:10.990 --> 16:12.556
it's from 1989, right?

16:12.625 --> 16:16.393
Hair root tissue does not
degrade if it's well preserved.

16:16.462 --> 16:17.528
And this was kept in

16:17.597 --> 16:19.930
an environmentally-controlled,

16:19.999 --> 16:22.633
secure evidence locker.

16:22.702 --> 16:24.702
So, this was a
"good" sample?

16:24.771 --> 16:26.237
Put it this way:

16:26.305 --> 16:29.373
I dream of many things--
of world peace,

16:29.442 --> 16:31.041
space travel,

16:31.110 --> 16:32.910
cohosting a podcast

16:32.979 --> 16:34.245
with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

16:34.313 --> 16:36.247
But as a forensic scientist,

16:36.315 --> 16:40.384
a DNA sample <i>this</i> clean
is at the <i>top</i> of my list.

16:40.453 --> 16:42.987
Thank you very much, Ms. Hines.

16:43.055 --> 16:45.156
Mr. Madson, your witness.

16:45.224 --> 16:46.991
Oh, boy...

16:47.960 --> 16:48.960
Yes.

16:56.569 --> 16:58.569
Mr. Madson, we're waiting.

16:58.638 --> 17:00.638
Um, no questions, Your Honor.

17:03.009 --> 17:04.942
Ms. Hines, you may step down.

17:05.011 --> 17:07.243
Oh. For real?

17:07.313 --> 17:08.313
Yes.

17:09.648 --> 17:11.015
Uh, sidebar, Your Honor?

17:11.083 --> 17:12.483
Please.

17:22.762 --> 17:24.428
What happened?
Did-did I mess up?

17:24.497 --> 17:26.864
- No. No, you didn't.
- What's going on?

17:30.736 --> 17:33.771
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
in light of new information,

17:33.840 --> 17:35.105
I'm suppressing

17:35.174 --> 17:37.141
all DNA evidence.

17:37.210 --> 17:40.945
Further, I'm going to strike
any DNA-related testimony,

17:41.013 --> 17:44.615
including the testimony
we just heard from Ms. Hines.

17:44.684 --> 17:46.450
I messed up.

17:46.519 --> 17:48.452
- No, you didn't.
- Gibbs.

17:48.521 --> 17:49.865
Your Honor.
How did this happen?

17:49.889 --> 17:51.388
It has been established

17:51.457 --> 17:55.059
that DNA evidence is the only
reason NCIS found my client.

17:55.127 --> 17:56.994
It is fruit of
the poisonous tree

17:57.063 --> 17:58.796
and so is everything
after that.

17:58.865 --> 18:01.398
I move for
an immediate mistrial.

18:02.869 --> 18:04.501
Ms. Hutchins?

18:04.570 --> 18:06.537
Your Honor, you cannot
let this man walk.

18:06.606 --> 18:08.572
He confessed to murder.

18:08.641 --> 18:10.574
Which is no longer admissible.

18:10.643 --> 18:12.977
Do you have any <i>legal</i> grounds
to object?

18:19.218 --> 18:20.885
No, Your Honor.

18:20.953 --> 18:22.586
Then the motion is granted.

18:22.655 --> 18:25.055
Mr. Crum, you're free to go.

18:38.610 --> 18:41.158
What a nightmare.
How did this get missed?

18:41.159 --> 18:42.303
I was wondering the same thing.

18:42.327 --> 18:43.492
Oh, don't put
this on me.

18:43.561 --> 18:45.027
Hey, I don't know
what "this" is.

18:45.096 --> 18:46.495
I do know

18:46.564 --> 18:48.130
a guilty man just walked free.

18:48.199 --> 18:49.432
Stuart Crum's DNA

18:49.500 --> 18:51.200
should never have been
in the database.

18:51.269 --> 18:52.868
It's there now.

18:52.937 --> 18:55.605
When Crum was questioned
in the robbery two years ago,

18:55.673 --> 18:58.174
he gave a DNA sample,
which eventually cleared him

18:58.243 --> 18:59.375
of all charges.

18:59.444 --> 19:01.110
Per an amendment
to subtitle five

19:01.179 --> 19:03.546
of the Maryland police code,
that sample

19:03.615 --> 19:04.780
should've been destroyed.

19:04.849 --> 19:06.349
But it wasn't, Judge.

19:06.417 --> 19:09.151
- No.
- Instead, Maryland police

19:09.220 --> 19:11.654
mistakenly added it to CODIS,
allowing NCIS

19:11.723 --> 19:13.623
to get a hit,

19:13.691 --> 19:15.791
which legally,
never should have happened.

19:15.860 --> 19:18.461
No DNA, no Crum.
No Crum,

19:18.529 --> 19:21.030
no confession.
I was bound by law

19:21.099 --> 19:22.665
to declare a mistrial.

19:23.935 --> 19:25.701
Colt, what's happening
out there?

19:25.770 --> 19:27.069
Press still roaming
the halls.

19:27.138 --> 19:29.538
You got food and water
for a few days?

19:29.607 --> 19:32.308
If only more people understood

19:32.377 --> 19:35.144
that the scales of justice
are rarely balanced.

19:35.213 --> 19:37.913
Never gets easier to stomach.

19:37.982 --> 19:39.582
No.

19:39.651 --> 19:44.053
But... Ms. Hutchins, you
and NCIS have to start all over.

19:44.122 --> 19:45.821
Without knowing that

19:45.890 --> 19:47.356
Stuart Crum exists.

19:47.425 --> 19:48.758
That's impossible.

19:48.826 --> 19:51.085
That's the law.
For better or worse.

19:51.109 --> 19:52.462
Worse.

19:52.463 --> 19:55.531
Look, I'll do what I can to
help, but I cannot give

19:55.600 --> 19:57.333
the appellate court
grounds for overturning.

19:57.402 --> 19:58.934
It's got to be done
by the book.

19:59.003 --> 20:01.103
If you can make a case at all.

20:05.677 --> 20:07.443
Clearly, the law works.

20:07.512 --> 20:09.945
Innocent until
proven guilty. Well,

20:10.014 --> 20:12.181
I do look forward
to a full apology

20:12.250 --> 20:16.519
from the U.S. attorney's office
and NCIS.

20:16.587 --> 20:19.855
And that's all I have
to say for here.

20:19.924 --> 20:22.792
For appearances or,
uh, interviews, please just,

20:22.860 --> 20:24.427
just contact my lawyer.

20:30.501 --> 20:33.269
What do you have to say for
yourself now, Agent Gibbs?

20:33.338 --> 20:35.371
- My son's killer's going free!
- We'll get him.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.739
You said that already.

20:36.808 --> 20:38.541
How would you feel
if he killed your kid?

20:38.609 --> 20:40.976
Am I supposed to just
forget the face of the man

20:41.045 --> 20:42.311
that took my child?
- No.

20:42.380 --> 20:44.380
Then if you don't make
Crum pay, I will!

20:44.449 --> 20:45.548
One way or the other!

20:45.616 --> 20:46.816
You don't want to do that.

20:46.884 --> 20:48.117
It's not a matter
of want!

20:48.186 --> 20:50.953
It's need, because
you can't do your job!

20:51.022 --> 20:54.757
Get out of the way.
Get out of my way, get! Move!

21:06.637 --> 21:08.104
Bet's a bet.

21:08.172 --> 21:11.474
No. Winning is no longer fun.

21:11.542 --> 21:14.076
This is a
30-year-old case.

21:14.145 --> 21:16.746
We were lucky to get
what we had before.

21:16.814 --> 21:19.949
All we need is another
way to get his DNA.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.317
Let's follow him.

21:21.386 --> 21:22.618
That's illegal.

21:22.687 --> 21:24.331
We have to forget
that we know him, remember?

21:24.355 --> 21:27.189
That's crazy. I mean, we know
where the treasure is buried.

21:27.258 --> 21:28.533
We can't dig!

21:28.534 --> 21:30.192
The treasure confessed.

21:31.362 --> 21:32.261
Let's go through his trash.

21:32.330 --> 21:33.662
We can't.

21:33.731 --> 21:35.811
Well, it wouldn't be the first
time we bend the rules

21:35.867 --> 21:37.266
just a little bit.

21:37.335 --> 21:39.201
We're not giving
his lawyer ammunition.

21:39.270 --> 21:41.771
That guy does not go free again.

21:41.839 --> 21:43.105
Amen.

21:43.174 --> 21:46.008
Okay, so...
how do we do that?

21:46.077 --> 21:49.311
Well, start with getting that
off the screen.

21:56.754 --> 21:58.154
This is incredible.

21:58.222 --> 22:00.489
How is it sensing my hands
without gloves?

22:00.558 --> 22:03.826
Until you're an employee,
I can only <i>show</i> you the magic.

22:03.895 --> 22:06.996
And these babies don't hit
the market until late 2020.

22:07.064 --> 22:09.298
Gonna be hard to wait.

22:09.367 --> 22:11.467
I've tasted the forbidden fruit.

22:11.536 --> 22:13.402
Well, if you sign
start paperwork,

22:13.471 --> 22:15.905
you'll be able to join a beta
testing group right away.

22:15.973 --> 22:19.408
What do you say? Ready
to become a "Splendid"?

22:19.477 --> 22:22.178
Oh.

22:22.246 --> 22:25.514
Uh, just give me one sec.
I got to take this.

22:25.583 --> 22:27.850
Bishop, hey. What's wrong?

22:27.919 --> 22:29.418
How do you know
something's wrong?

22:29.487 --> 22:31.720
Well, you never call me
on personal days.

22:31.789 --> 22:33.222
I used to like that about you.

22:33.291 --> 22:35.524
I know, I know, I'm sorry.
I just--

22:35.593 --> 22:37.326
Things are bad here.

22:37.395 --> 22:40.663
Is there any way you can come
into the office to help out?

22:40.731 --> 22:42.364
Uh, no, not really.

22:42.433 --> 22:44.767
Okay. Okay. Never mind.

22:44.836 --> 22:46.202
Why? What happened?

22:46.270 --> 22:47.881
No, I-I don't want to tell you.
I don't want you

22:47.905 --> 22:49.872
to think about it
while you're with your family.

22:49.941 --> 22:51.774
Well, I wouldn't
hold your breath.

22:51.843 --> 22:54.743
How can I help you, Agent McGee?

22:54.812 --> 22:57.413
McGee. Was that a Mary Beth?

22:57.482 --> 22:59.348
Um, yes.

22:59.417 --> 23:02.184
I thought you hated
those things.

23:02.253 --> 23:04.386
Privacy issues and all.

23:04.455 --> 23:06.956
And why is she calling you
"Agent McGee"?

23:07.024 --> 23:09.124
Um, it's a power thing.

23:09.193 --> 23:10.571
Attention, all you Splendids,

23:10.595 --> 23:13.896
the Taco Tuesday truck
is now open on the south lawn.

23:13.965 --> 23:16.232
Tacos? McGee, where are you?

23:16.300 --> 23:18.868
I got to go, Bishop. Johnny just
threw up on the settee.

23:20.705 --> 23:22.271
The "settee"?

23:22.340 --> 23:25.207
Yeah, it's a thing.

23:25.276 --> 23:26.942
Tacos.

23:32.049 --> 23:33.415
Yo, this is evil.

23:33.484 --> 23:34.950
Seriously, Ducky,

23:35.019 --> 23:37.286
you can't expect us to
go through all of these.

23:37.355 --> 23:42.091
Each one of those files
represents an NCIS investigation

23:42.159 --> 23:45.728
where the accused went free
on a legal technicality

23:45.796 --> 23:47.429
or mistake.

23:47.498 --> 23:50.165
It's meant to be enlightening.

23:50.234 --> 23:53.102
Okay, great, except
it's depressing.

23:53.170 --> 23:55.004
Well, this is the job.

23:55.072 --> 23:57.740
Time to get back
in the game, folks.

23:57.808 --> 24:00.943
A lot of these cases
have been successfully retried.

24:01.012 --> 24:04.179
Okay, so you think there's
something useful in here?

24:04.248 --> 24:06.782
Something to help us
bring down Stuart Crum?

24:06.851 --> 24:08.284
Yep.

24:08.352 --> 24:10.986
No, I'm with Nick.
This is just depressing.

24:11.055 --> 24:13.789
Man, what are we even doing?

24:13.858 --> 24:15.624
Banging our heads
against the wall?

24:15.693 --> 24:18.961
So, let's keep banging
until we break through.

24:19.030 --> 24:22.031
Yeah. Otherwise...

24:22.099 --> 24:25.534
Mr. Crum will remain a free man.

24:26.938 --> 24:28.037
Stay on him.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.876
My man, we got next!

24:33.945 --> 24:37.146
Mmm.

24:37.214 --> 24:41.050
Hey, you got to box out
on the rebound!

25:22.325 --> 25:23.891
Hey, man.

25:23.960 --> 25:26.260
Park police found
the body this morning.

25:26.329 --> 25:28.029
Dead gets us DNA now.

25:29.733 --> 25:31.232
Oh, yeah.

25:31.301 --> 25:33.713
You know, if I was a songwriter,
I'd write a song about today.

25:33.737 --> 25:35.536
It'd be something
really catchy.

25:35.605 --> 25:38.039
Yeah, nothing like dancing
to the untimely death

25:38.108 --> 25:39.440
of a child murderer.

25:39.509 --> 25:42.176
Untimely? Come on.

25:42.245 --> 25:44.345
The guy decided to
celebrate going free

25:44.414 --> 25:45.713
and took too many happy pills.

25:45.782 --> 25:47.915
Uh, we won't know the
official cause of death

25:47.984 --> 25:49.217
until autopsy, Nick.

25:49.285 --> 25:51.252
I'll give you
the cause of death.

25:51.321 --> 25:53.054
That looks like oxycodone.

25:53.123 --> 25:54.956
And there's a dead body
next to it.

25:55.024 --> 25:59.093
Well... pinpoint
pupils, cotton mouth.

25:59.162 --> 26:00.602
They are consistent
with an overdose.

26:00.630 --> 26:02.630
Karma?

26:02.699 --> 26:04.699
Karma, luck, whatever.

26:04.768 --> 26:07.235
The universe just
balanced a scale.

26:07.303 --> 26:09.871
Saved us time and
the taxpayers' money.

26:09.939 --> 26:11.973
I'd say it's a pretty good day.

26:12.041 --> 26:14.409
- - There's no vomit.
What?

26:14.477 --> 26:16.210
It's the body's
natural defense system

26:16.279 --> 26:17.779
when it ingests something bad.

26:17.847 --> 26:19.647
Usually, when there's an
accidental overdose,

26:19.716 --> 26:21.482
the body tries to
expel the drugs.

26:21.551 --> 26:24.085
This man did not vomit.

26:24.154 --> 26:26.053
So, what are you saying, Jimmy?

26:26.122 --> 26:29.157
I am saying we should
wait until autopsy.

26:29.225 --> 26:31.159
Well, our previous
investigation into Crum

26:31.227 --> 26:33.294
showed no history
of drug use.

26:33.363 --> 26:35.596
Oh, come on, we're not
calling this guy a victim.

26:35.665 --> 26:37.565
Come on, nobody cares
about this guy.

26:37.634 --> 26:39.000
Hey, it's not about him.

26:39.068 --> 26:41.002
It's about justice, yeah,

26:41.070 --> 26:42.837
but this feels like
natural justice.

26:44.541 --> 26:46.407
It's our job to find out.

26:46.476 --> 26:49.110
Well, an accidental OD so soon
after going free

26:49.179 --> 26:51.279
does seem a wee bit convenient.

26:51.347 --> 26:53.448
Yeah, it's convenient.
We get to tell Tommy's dad

26:53.516 --> 26:54.649
that the killer's dead.

26:54.717 --> 26:55.783
Isn't that what he wanted?

26:55.852 --> 26:57.418
That's the problem.

26:59.856 --> 27:02.067
If this wasn't an accident, the
dad becomes our lead suspect.

27:02.091 --> 27:04.759
Right. Let's make sure.

27:08.264 --> 27:09.764
Blood came back.

27:09.833 --> 27:12.800
Crum had enough oxy
in his system to drop a rhino.

27:12.869 --> 27:15.102
- Hardly a recreational dose.
- Hmm.

27:15.171 --> 27:15.868
Hairline fracture?

27:15.869 --> 27:17.155
On Crum's left clavicle,

27:17.179 --> 27:19.510
to go along with the slight
bruising on his neck.

27:20.277 --> 27:22.644
Someone choked this guy out,
then force-fed him?

27:22.713 --> 27:25.046
Wish I could say otherwise.

27:25.115 --> 27:26.648
Oh, murder is murder.

27:26.717 --> 27:29.050
If somebody killed this guy,
it's wrong, Jimmy.

27:29.119 --> 27:32.287
Yeah, but he was, like, an
exceptionally bad person.

27:32.356 --> 27:34.334
Yeah, you're talking to the
woman who just confirmed

27:34.358 --> 27:37.058
that he was
the Ice Cream Killer.

27:37.127 --> 27:41.196
While our current justice system
is far, far from perfect,

27:41.264 --> 27:43.164
it's better than
blind vengeance.

27:44.434 --> 27:47.235
It has to be, right?

27:47.304 --> 27:49.504
And we have dedicated
our lives to it.

27:49.573 --> 27:52.374
So we treat this like
the crime it is,

27:52.442 --> 27:55.076
and we call this man a victim.

27:55.145 --> 27:58.380
So? What do you got, Doctor?

27:58.448 --> 28:00.815
Right. Our <i>victim</i> was killed

28:00.884 --> 28:03.651
between 9:00 and 11:00 p.m.
last night.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.354
But there's nothing
on his body or in his car

28:06.423 --> 28:08.089
to tell us who the killer was.

28:08.158 --> 28:09.591
How about you?

28:09.659 --> 28:11.559
Uh, other than
his own fingerprints,

28:11.628 --> 28:13.828
the only thing at his home
was electronics.

28:13.897 --> 28:15.530
Laptop, phone...

28:15.599 --> 28:19.067
It's time for both of us
to dig a little deeper

28:19.136 --> 28:20.935
into Mr. Stuart Crum.

28:21.004 --> 28:24.339
Me figuratively
and you literally.

28:27.310 --> 28:29.544
And justice for all.

28:31.314 --> 28:33.415
Federal agents!

28:33.483 --> 28:36.351
NCIS! Kyle Larson!

28:36.420 --> 28:37.685
Mr. Larson?

28:37.754 --> 28:40.288
Yeah? Down here.

28:40.357 --> 28:44.292
I saw it on the news.
Crum was murdered.

28:44.361 --> 28:47.062
News didn't say murder.

28:47.130 --> 28:51.132
But I made very public threats,
and, uh, now you're here, right?

28:51.201 --> 28:53.735
This is the same basement
your son died.

28:53.804 --> 28:55.904
Ah, I got the house
in the divorce.

28:55.972 --> 28:58.773
- You sleep down here?
-Sometimes.

28:58.842 --> 29:01.843
When I see Tommy in my dreams,

29:01.878 --> 29:05.413
it can take a while
to figure out it isn't real,

29:05.482 --> 29:07.315
but if I wake up
down here,

29:07.384 --> 29:09.617
like a bucket of cold water.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.387
Does drinking help?

29:12.456 --> 29:15.657
Rarely, but I've stopped now.

29:15.725 --> 29:18.093
- Since when?
- Last night.

29:18.161 --> 29:19.661
What changed last night?

29:22.866 --> 29:24.299
These yours?

29:24.367 --> 29:29.070
I had back surgery.
Pain just still comes and goes.

29:29.139 --> 29:30.338
Agent Gibbs,

29:30.407 --> 29:32.774
whatever I said to you
in that courthouse,

29:32.843 --> 29:35.510
I promise I didn't kill
Stuart Crum.

29:37.247 --> 29:39.781
Help us prove it.
Where were you last night?

29:39.850 --> 29:41.149
Down here.

29:41.218 --> 29:43.518
Right. Not drinking.

29:44.921 --> 29:47.622
Anybody who can verify that?

29:47.691 --> 29:52.260
I've wanted to kill the man who
killed my family for 30 years.

29:52.329 --> 29:56.331
Now that he's dead, feels good,

29:56.399 --> 29:57.765
but I didn't do it.

29:59.336 --> 30:02.303
Even if I did,
could you blame me, really?

30:02.372 --> 30:04.172
Alibi.

30:06.543 --> 30:07.876
I have one,

30:07.944 --> 30:10.178
I swear.

30:10.247 --> 30:13.982
I just don't want you
to go and ruin things.

30:16.052 --> 30:18.052
What things?

30:23.627 --> 30:26.027
All right. Mary Beth,
please open the door

30:26.096 --> 30:27.662
to section 117.

30:27.731 --> 30:30.231
Agent McGee, you are
one hour and 22 minutes early

30:30.300 --> 30:32.367
for this part of your tour.
- Yes, I know.

30:32.435 --> 30:35.236
- Open the door.
- No problem.

30:35.305 --> 30:36.671
Yes.

30:36.740 --> 30:39.807
I will alert Clarissa
that you have arrived.

30:39.876 --> 30:41.876
No, no.

30:45.565 --> 30:47.348
Ooh, all right.

30:53.940 --> 30:56.274
Thank you, Director.

30:56.343 --> 30:58.743
Agent McGee, Clarissa
says she is on her way.

30:58.812 --> 30:59.972
I really hate you, Mary Beth.

31:00.013 --> 31:02.080
I'm sorry you feel
that way, Agent McGee.

31:02.148 --> 31:03.281
Was it something I said?

31:03.350 --> 31:04.777
- Oh, this isn't good.
- No, I'm good.

31:04.801 --> 31:06.262
Agent McGee?

31:06.286 --> 31:08.586
Are you in there?

31:08.655 --> 31:11.923
Good morning. I didn't know
you were coming in early.

31:11.992 --> 31:14.409
Well, I was so excited,
I couldn't get any sleep.

31:14.477 --> 31:17.462
Said nobody ever about
Government Cloud Services.

31:17.530 --> 31:19.697
Did you see everything
you wanted to see?

31:19.766 --> 31:22.867
Totally, totally.
I love how Splendifida secures

31:22.936 --> 31:25.136
critical information
assets at the source

31:25.205 --> 31:27.405
and not just
the perimeter.

31:27.474 --> 31:28.834
Do you have a bathroom
around here?

31:28.875 --> 31:30.241
Oh, down the hall
to your right.

31:30.310 --> 31:33.378
Great. Oh, uh, would you
mind holding this.

31:33.446 --> 31:35.413
Don't want it to fall in.

31:45.959 --> 31:49.427
Yes, I called my father
last night around 9:00 p.m.

31:49.496 --> 31:52.764
He was hesitant to admit that,
Ms. Larson.

31:52.832 --> 31:54.399
Call me Jen.

31:54.467 --> 31:57.068
And it's probably because
it was the first time

31:57.137 --> 31:59.804
the two of us had spoken
in ten years,

31:59.873 --> 32:01.472
since Mom's funeral.

32:01.541 --> 32:03.474
Wasn't an easy call to make.

32:03.543 --> 32:06.844
He's been out of my life
for a long time.

32:06.913 --> 32:08.813
We were all
devastated

32:08.882 --> 32:11.299
by Tommy's death.
I mean,

32:11.368 --> 32:14.002
I watched my older
brother die, but...

32:14.070 --> 32:16.671
losing Tommy broke Dad.

32:16.740 --> 32:20.008
He was all anger
all the time, so

32:20.076 --> 32:23.611
Mom left and she
took me with her.

32:24.714 --> 32:26.481
What changed last night?

32:26.549 --> 32:28.850
Since the mistrial,
I've been angry.

32:28.918 --> 32:30.585
I mean, so angry
that I didn't know

32:30.654 --> 32:32.153
what to do.

32:32.222 --> 32:35.590
Uh, which is when I
realized that that's what

32:35.659 --> 32:37.925
Dad's been feeling
for the last 30 years.

32:37.994 --> 32:39.494
That same anger.

32:39.562 --> 32:41.529
And I-I'm not saying
that he's right

32:41.598 --> 32:43.831
to carry it with him
all that time, just that...

32:45.001 --> 32:47.201
I finally
understood it.

32:47.270 --> 32:48.703
So...

32:48.772 --> 32:50.705
I reached out to tell him that.

32:53.843 --> 32:55.176
Need to get that?

32:56.446 --> 32:57.712
It's work.

32:57.781 --> 32:59.147
It can wait.

32:59.215 --> 33:00.815
So, you're a lawyer.

33:00.884 --> 33:02.884
A public defender.

33:02.952 --> 33:05.186
Dedicated your life to justice.

33:05.255 --> 33:07.872
Well... like I said,

33:07.974 --> 33:10.575
Tommy's death affected us
all differently.

33:10.643 --> 33:14.295
So, phone records show
your call lasted 27 minutes.

33:14.364 --> 33:17.015
Well, that call
was just the start

33:17.083 --> 33:19.534
of a very long road
to redemption.

33:21.271 --> 33:22.904
What?

33:22.972 --> 33:24.205
Is that bad?

33:24.274 --> 33:27.709
Crum's murder was between
9:00 and 11:00.

33:27.777 --> 33:29.977
It's a two-hour window.

33:30.046 --> 33:33.548
No... uh, that call
helped Dad's anger.

33:33.616 --> 33:35.850
He even said if
I keep calling,

33:35.919 --> 33:37.652
he'd stop drinking;
it's not like he hung up

33:37.721 --> 33:39.387
the phone and went
on a killing spree.

33:39.456 --> 33:41.689
You can't let
this fall on him.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.024
That man has been through hell.

33:44.994 --> 33:46.561
Apologies for the interruption.

33:46.629 --> 33:48.596
Gibbs, a word?

33:51.601 --> 33:54.268
You keep calling your dad, Jen.
We'll handle the rest.

33:57.907 --> 34:00.041
Agent McGee has news.

34:00.110 --> 34:01.909
I called Officer
Clark to come in

34:01.978 --> 34:03.678
but he refuses
to meet us here.

34:03.747 --> 34:05.696
He's CIA,
his job to be cautious.

34:05.765 --> 34:07.563
Yeah, unless it borders on paranoia.

34:07.564 --> 34:09.578
Okay, well, let's go someplace
where he's comfortable.

34:09.601 --> 34:11.034
All right.

34:12.938 --> 34:14.871
It's open!

34:18.928 --> 34:20.628
Director, Gibbs.

34:20.697 --> 34:22.864
Sorry I'm late; I'm pretty sure
I was being followed.

34:22.931 --> 34:23.833
By whom?

34:23.857 --> 34:25.534
Well, could be
anyone at this point.

34:25.534 --> 34:28.016
So this, this phone
call better be helpful.

34:28.041 --> 34:29.138
Agent McGee.

34:29.139 --> 34:31.873
Would you please tell Officer
Clark what you just told us?

34:31.940 --> 34:33.975
I was tasked with accessing

34:34.043 --> 34:36.043
government records.
Specifically SecDef's

34:36.112 --> 34:37.978
offshore account.

34:38.047 --> 34:41.215
And what did
our inside man find?

34:41.284 --> 34:43.818
Well, after a $3 million
withdrawal last night,

34:43.887 --> 34:45.319
the account was then closed.

34:45.388 --> 34:47.588
Closed? By who?

34:47.657 --> 34:49.056
I have no idea.

34:49.125 --> 34:50.458
There's no transfer record.

34:50.527 --> 34:52.760
And I don't know who
withdrew that money, either.

34:52.829 --> 34:55.463
So where did the rest
of the $250 million go?

34:55.532 --> 34:58.266
- We also don't know that.
- Damn it.

34:58.334 --> 35:00.134
They know we're digging.

35:00.203 --> 35:02.437
Yes and we're gonna keep digging
until we know more.

35:02.505 --> 35:03.805
Get back into
the records, McGee.

35:05.542 --> 35:06.542
You hear me, McGee?

35:08.144 --> 35:09.610
Uh...

35:09.679 --> 35:11.846
I hear you,
boss, but, um...

35:11.915 --> 35:13.614
it may be kind of difficult.

35:13.683 --> 35:15.149
Well, why?

35:15.218 --> 35:17.852
I think I'm being arrested.

35:23.856 --> 35:25.279
Did you know McGee
was in California?

35:25.303 --> 35:26.091
No.

35:26.092 --> 35:28.525
Did you know about SecDef's
secret offshore account?

35:28.594 --> 35:31.128
You mean the one with
$250 million in it? No.

35:31.197 --> 35:32.997
What I don't get
is what Vance wants us

35:33.065 --> 35:35.299
to do about it now
that McGee's been caught.

35:35.368 --> 35:36.900
That's what you don't get?

35:36.969 --> 35:39.870
How could Gibbs keep
something this big from us?

35:39.939 --> 35:42.973
Well, Gibbs
is gonna want answers,

35:43.042 --> 35:44.975
not hard feelings.
- Answers on McGee

35:45.044 --> 35:46.977
or answers on our
killer, Stuart Crum?

35:47.046 --> 35:48.579
Both.

35:48.648 --> 35:49.404
What do we know?

35:49.428 --> 35:51.596
Well, nothing new
on either case.

35:51.917 --> 35:55.519
Yeah, Kase. Yeah, we're
all on our way down.

35:55.588 --> 35:57.221
Come on.

36:00.293 --> 36:01.213
Go.

36:01.237 --> 36:03.237
Please pull down
your lap bars for the

36:03.296 --> 36:05.996
mother of all good news/
bad news roller coasters.

36:06.065 --> 36:08.666
Good news:
I got into Crum's laptop.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.167
Oh. And the bad news?

36:10.236 --> 36:12.870
It was wiped clean sometime
before he was killed, no help.

36:12.938 --> 36:15.439
Is there any more good news?

36:15.508 --> 36:17.408
Well, there's
still a way to find

36:17.476 --> 36:19.243
a threatening e-mail
or phone call that could

36:19.312 --> 36:21.745
lead us to our killer,
because, like half of America,

36:21.814 --> 36:24.048
Crum had an online
backup service.

36:24.116 --> 36:25.849
So all we have to do

36:25.918 --> 36:27.217
is ask Splendifida

36:27.286 --> 36:28.752
for his cloud data.

36:28.821 --> 36:30.254
Hmm. Splendifida.

36:30.323 --> 36:32.389
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.058
Mm, that was the good news.

36:34.126 --> 36:36.193
Tech companies work
with the police all the time.

36:36.262 --> 36:38.395
Unless they catch
one of your agents

36:38.464 --> 36:40.097
snooping in their servers.

36:40.166 --> 36:41.732
Is that a euphemism?

36:41.801 --> 36:45.469
Look, if we want Crum's data
without a fight,

36:45.538 --> 36:46.870
we're gonna
have to get a warrant.

36:46.939 --> 36:48.439
How is that gonna help McGee?

36:48.507 --> 36:50.040
Well, it doesn't.

36:50.109 --> 36:51.975
It'll probably piss the
company off even more.

36:52.044 --> 36:54.356
I mean, this could cause
a legal nightmare, Gibbs.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.946
That works.

36:56.015 --> 36:57.915
Yeah. Hey.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.416
Hmm.

36:59.452 --> 37:01.885
Were you ever considering
our job offer, Agent McGee?

37:01.954 --> 37:03.287
Or was it all a front

37:03.356 --> 37:04.588
to steal information?

37:04.657 --> 37:06.156
I didn't steal anything.

37:06.225 --> 37:08.659
Look, you confiscated my
phone, you searched my person.

37:08.728 --> 37:10.227
Thoroughly, thank you.

37:10.296 --> 37:11.662
You have no right to hold me.

37:11.731 --> 37:13.475
Clearly you didn't read
the terms and conditions

37:13.499 --> 37:14.832
of your nondisclosure agreement.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.301
Oh, come on,
no one reads those things.

37:20.473 --> 37:21.839
You don't say a word.

37:23.509 --> 37:25.509
This is Clarissa Bondurant
with Splendifida

37:25.578 --> 37:28.078
Human Resources,
with whom am I speaking?

37:28.147 --> 37:30.013
Oh, I see.

37:30.082 --> 37:31.682
Hello, sir, I--

37:31.751 --> 37:33.684
A warrant?
Is this related to--

37:36.322 --> 37:37.921
Yes, it just came through
on my e-mail.

37:37.990 --> 37:39.089
But as to the matter

37:39.158 --> 37:40.669
of Agent McGee,
we caught him looking through

37:40.693 --> 37:42.993
secure government servers.

37:43.062 --> 37:46.029
Evidence? Well, no, but...

37:46.098 --> 37:48.766
No, sir. However, I...

37:50.269 --> 37:51.802
You, too.

37:53.839 --> 37:55.839
Agent McGee, you are free to go.

37:55.908 --> 37:57.374
I am?

37:57.443 --> 38:00.010
With the understanding that you
no longer have a job offer

38:00.079 --> 38:02.224
and will no longer be permitted
to purchase any Splendifida

38:02.248 --> 38:04.615
products or services
directly from the company.

38:04.683 --> 38:05.949
Wow.

38:06.018 --> 38:07.384
Agent Gibbs said all that?

38:07.453 --> 38:09.486
Who's Agent Gibbs?

38:13.526 --> 38:15.951
NCIS thanks you for fast-tracking
our warrant, Judge Deakin.

38:15.952 --> 38:18.195
I did tell Agent
Gibbs I'd help.

38:18.264 --> 38:20.531
And as for getting
our agent off the hook...

38:20.599 --> 38:23.534
I threw a little legal jargon
around, you're lucky it worked.

38:23.602 --> 38:25.235
Not exactly by the book,

38:25.304 --> 38:27.171
but not illegal, either.

38:27.239 --> 38:29.840
Technicalities
work both ways, Judge.

38:29.909 --> 38:31.475
I suppose you're right.

38:31.544 --> 38:33.210
- We done here?
- Yes, go.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.513
You'll have to excuse him,
Judge.

38:36.582 --> 38:38.048
NCIS still has a killer to find.

38:38.117 --> 38:41.585
I may have grossly
underestimated Agent Gibbs.

38:41.654 --> 38:43.220
He doesn't quit.

38:46.559 --> 38:50.160
This was your idea, Kasie Hines.

38:50.229 --> 38:53.597
You made Leroy Jethro Gibbs
get a warrant for this data.

38:53.666 --> 38:57.034
You will find something useful.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.236
Question is,
Kasie Hines,

38:59.305 --> 39:01.905
have you?
- No, there is nothing

39:01.974 --> 39:03.407
in these e-mails
but more

39:03.476 --> 39:05.375
bad news.
- Mm-hmm.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.110
So why are
you smiling?

39:07.179 --> 39:09.213
Because McGee
was right.

39:09.281 --> 39:12.549
- About what?
- Mary Beth is always listening.

39:12.618 --> 39:14.084
Well, yeah,
he's preached that gospel

39:14.153 --> 39:15.919
to me more
than a few times.

39:15.988 --> 39:17.591
But how does this
relate to Stuart Crum?

39:17.615 --> 39:18.756
So, when we searched

39:18.757 --> 39:20.190
Crum's house,
I noticed

39:20.259 --> 39:22.426
Mary Beth devices all over.

39:22.495 --> 39:27.030
And now that NCIS has all
that Splendifida data...

39:27.099 --> 39:28.515
You were able to test
McGee's phobia.

39:28.539 --> 39:29.267
Mm-hmm.

39:29.268 --> 39:30.734
Not only did a few

39:30.803 --> 39:32.769
audio devices
"accidentally" record...

39:32.838 --> 39:35.639
Something the company
swears their devices never do.

39:35.708 --> 39:39.810
...a video-enabled Mary Beth on
the kitchen counter triggered

39:39.879 --> 39:42.880
and "accidentally"
caught this.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.749
Ooh, somebody's creeping.

39:45.818 --> 39:48.285
Oh, tell me it's not
that poor dad.

39:51.023 --> 39:53.290
It's not Kyle Larson.

39:54.393 --> 39:55.792
That's the bailiff from court.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.930
What's he doing there?

39:59.999 --> 40:01.498
I think we should ask.

40:03.636 --> 40:05.769
You going somewhere, Colt?

40:05.838 --> 40:07.471
- No.

40:07.540 --> 40:09.139
Well, that's funny.

40:09.208 --> 40:12.576
'Cause airport security stopped
you on your way to Germany.

40:12.645 --> 40:14.444
You caught me.

40:14.513 --> 40:15.979
I like schnitzel.

40:17.483 --> 40:18.749
You were at Crum's house.

40:20.252 --> 40:21.785
Cell phone towers

40:21.854 --> 40:23.487
put you at the park

40:23.556 --> 40:25.022
at his time of death.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.291
We know you killed him.

40:28.661 --> 40:30.994
Who were you calling?

40:32.097 --> 40:33.630
I've spent years in courtrooms

40:33.699 --> 40:35.666
watching people
abuse the system.

40:35.734 --> 40:37.534
The system
was supposed

40:37.603 --> 40:40.037
to protect the innocent,
not free the guilty.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.206
To balance the scales,

40:43.275 --> 40:45.509
sometimes you have
to apply pressure.

40:45.578 --> 40:47.778
Did you?

40:50.749 --> 40:54.017
It's time I avail myself
of that very same system.

40:54.086 --> 40:56.119
Guess that's one
of the perks of the job.

40:56.188 --> 40:57.821
I know good lawyers.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.890
It's time I called one.

41:01.293 --> 41:02.826
Now.

41:03.929 --> 41:05.562
Yes, thank you.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.097
So, as much
as I love schnitzel,

41:07.132 --> 41:09.110
I don't think this guy
went to Germany for the food.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.068
According to the FAA,
our bailiff

41:11.136 --> 41:12.576
was about to board
a private charter.

41:12.605 --> 41:14.249
- Expensive trip.
- Yeah, how'd he pay for it?

41:14.273 --> 41:15.872
Oh, I know, I know. Pick me.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.307
Apparently,
our bailiff

41:17.376 --> 41:20.577
had $3 million
waiting for him in Berlin.

41:20.646 --> 41:22.646
It was transferred
last night

41:22.715 --> 41:23.880
at 11:05.

41:23.949 --> 41:25.382
That's right after
Crum was killed.

41:25.451 --> 41:26.750
It's almost like...

41:26.819 --> 41:30.053
our bailiff was paid
for killing Crum.

41:30.122 --> 41:31.355
If he was, that would...

41:31.423 --> 41:33.590
That would make this a hit.
Who paid him?

41:33.659 --> 41:35.892
Oh, you're gonna love this one.

41:38.497 --> 41:41.198
Our hit man was paid with money
from SecDef's secret account?

41:41.266 --> 41:43.367
