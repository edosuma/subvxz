They invaded our world...

00:15.483 --> 00:20.988
And brought us viruses
that we could not survive.

00:21.055 --> 00:25.326
That broke the spirit
of the people.

00:25.393 --> 00:30.198
And now we are doing
the same thing in other lands...

00:30.264 --> 00:32.433
And other people.

00:34.102 --> 00:39.407
Our own young men
have forgotten the stories.

00:40.408 --> 00:43.344

00:43.411 --> 00:46.247
In places
where they don't belong.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.983
And when they come home,

00:50.050 --> 00:53.254
They will be the first
to be struck down.

[Man Narrating]
First hint of it
came on the wind,

01:51.145 --> 01:53.747
And it spread
like a prairie fire,

01:53.814 --> 01:55.683
Blowing through the world.

01:58.686 --> 02:01.755
No one knows what brought it
or where it came from.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.628
Maybe it had always been here,
just waiting...

02:09.263 --> 02:11.732
A punishment...

02:11.799 --> 02:13.601
Or a curse.

02:13.667 --> 02:17.471
But I think deep down we all
knew the storm was coming,

02:17.538 --> 02:19.907
Even if we didn't understand it.

02:24.212 --> 02:27.881
Now the wind belongs
to the dead and the damned.

02:29.082 --> 02:32.253
Cursed to walk it forever.

What I do know is that
I never should have come home.

kidding me.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.647

04:06.714 --> 04:08.682
Yeah, we just packed
the place two days ago.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.621
These goddamn
redneck looters.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.390
Yeah, whatever it is,
they ate everything.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.625
Not everything.

04:18.692 --> 04:22.863
They came from the marsh
and headed back
the same way they came.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.599
Why would looters head back
into the marsh?

04:27.167 --> 04:29.102
Well, we'll just
stay overnight,

out there,

04:52.493 --> 04:54.462
All you real
South Florida hunters,

04:54.528 --> 04:55.996
I've been asked
to relay a request.

04:56.063 --> 04:59.132
- Dad, what are you
grateful for?
- I don't know. Um...

04:59.199 --> 05:03.737
That I got a younger son
who's still willing to
hang out with his old man,

05:03.804 --> 05:05.573
So that's what
I'm thankful for.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.775
I'm also thankful
for you guys
to be out here...

05:07.841 --> 05:11.545

to a hot girlfriend.

dying out too.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.917
You're hanging around with
these guys a little too much.
He brought it there.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.919
You've done well.
Although not
for nothing.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.121
She did give him a bit
of the stink eye...

correctly.

for a 10-day retrain,

05:32.332 --> 05:34.134
And then back in country.

05:34.201 --> 05:37.571
If he ever
comes home, that is.
When's your call?

05:39.272 --> 05:42.443
I'm gonna be hanging out
with you backstabbing
civilians for a while.

They put me on a desk.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.997

I'm sorry, folks.
She's just...

What are, uh...

What are Wind Walkers?

22:50.002 --> 22:51.538
A myth.

22:54.741 --> 22:58.711
Okay. When our people
lost the land...

22:59.879 --> 23:01.548
One of the things
they missed most...

23:01.614 --> 23:05.351
Was the, uh,
sound in the wind moving.

You know,
through the palms.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.356

And when
the white armies came,

23:12.825 --> 23:14.961
Fucking around
where they didn't belong,

23:16.228 --> 23:18.598
They feared them.
Why?

23:20.467 --> 23:22.001
Because the Wind Walkers
would...

23:23.235 --> 23:27.674
Stay behind
to grab the white man
in the night.

01:21:29.085 --> 01:21:33.489
* Live while I can, yeah **

01:21:38.094 --> 01:21:41.230
** [Vocalizing]

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:45.534
** [Ends]

01:21:50.673 --> 01:21:52.375
They didn't find your canoe?

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:55.678
How come they didn't wreck it?

01:22:08.191 --> 01:22:11.494
[Kotz Narrating]
Who knows if this is the world
or just the edge of it?

01:22:13.529 --> 01:22:16.099
I wanna believe
that we'll be okay.

01:22:16.165 --> 01:22:18.367
The storm'll blow over...

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:22.271
And everything
will be like I remembered
when I get home.

01:22:22.338 --> 01:22:25.741
And everyone
will be waiting for us.

01:22:25.808 --> 01:22:27.376
But nothing happened.

01:22:29.112 --> 01:22:31.014
We'll just have to see.

01:22:35.818 --> 01:22:37.420
[Screeching]

01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:00.743
[Engine Revving]

01:23:03.146 --> 01:23:04.747
[Revving Continues]

01:23:26.169 --> 01:23:27.670
[Engine Stops]

01:23:52.595 --> 01:23:54.530
[Gurgling]

01:24:12.348 --> 01:24:14.983
The Wind Walkers
followed us...

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.919
Home.

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:20.323
[Gurgling, Gasping]

01:24:31.634 --> 01:24:33.536
[Gasping Stops]

01:24:50.853 --> 01:24:53.589
[Man On Radio]
Looks like Hurricane Dori
is knocking at our door.

01:24:53.656 --> 01:24:57.326
We've got one wind
chasing another across the Gulf.

01:24:57.393 --> 01:25:02.064
I don't know about you,
but I feel possessed tonight.

01:25:02.131 --> 01:25:04.133
This one goes out
to all of you out there...

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.968
Bracing yourselves
for the storm.

01:25:06.034 --> 01:25:08.271
Get your night eyes on.

01:25:08.337 --> 01:25:09.805
Stay tuned.
** [Rock]

01:25:09.872 --> 01:25:11.807
It's over.

01:25:13.676 --> 01:25:15.711
I'm so hungry, Kotz.

01:25:18.013 --> 01:25:19.715
I'm so hungry.

01:25:23.018 --> 01:25:25.788
** [Continues]

01:25:30.092 --> 01:25:31.927
[Man]
* I'll be on the road *

01:25:31.994 --> 01:25:34.863
* If you wanna take me home *

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:37.065
* Sick of all your brothers *

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:39.868
** [Continues, Indistinct]

01:25:39.935 --> 01:25:45.007
* Walking all alone
you can mail me to and fro *

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:47.176
* Sick of all your brothers *

01:25:47.243 --> 01:25:50.346
** [Continues, Indistinct]

01:25:50.413 --> 01:25:52.381
* Sick of all your brothers *

01:25:52.448 --> 01:25:55.518
** [Continues, Indistinct]

01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:57.220
* Sick of all your brothers **
[Screeches]

01:25:57.286 --> 01:26:00.789
** [Fades]

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:06.429
Some say the conquered tribes
left the Wind Walker behind...

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:10.266
To take the white man
into the night.

01:26:10.333 --> 01:26:14.637
A curse against them
for taking our land.

01:26:14.703 --> 01:26:19.308
But we know
that the Wind Walker
has always been here.

01:26:20.976 --> 01:26:23.846
And they will
always be here.

01:26:23.912 --> 01:26:25.848
* Sleep inside forever *

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:29.051
* There's no cold
inside his soul *

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:31.320
* Buried to the leaves *

01:26:31.387 --> 01:26:34.022
* There's another
with no fire *

01:26:34.089 --> 01:26:36.925
* All of your disease *

01:26:36.992 --> 01:26:39.362
* All of your desire *

01:26:39.428 --> 01:26:41.997
* All of your disease *

01:26:42.064 --> 01:26:44.433
* All of your desire *

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:47.069
* All of your disease *

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:49.538
* All of your desire *

01:26:49.605 --> 01:26:52.040
* All of your disease *

01:26:52.107 --> 01:26:54.677
* All of your desire *

01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:00.649
** [Continues, Instrumental]

01:27:33.349 --> 01:27:35.250
* I was on the road *

01:27:35.318 --> 01:27:38.220
* Hear them walking
down a while *

01:27:38.287 --> 01:27:40.956
* All that you can see *

01:27:41.023 --> 01:27:43.359
* All that you inspire *

01:27:43.426 --> 01:27:45.361
* Buried side by side *

01:27:45.428 --> 01:27:48.431
* Lie the master and his child *

01:27:48.497 --> 01:27:50.966
* All that you can see *

01:27:51.033 --> 01:27:53.536
