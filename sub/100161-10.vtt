WEBVTT

00:13.090 --> 00:17.219
Me, O'Malley, and Doyle,
we did this job back in '77.

00:17.220 --> 00:19.311
You know who else was on that job?

00:23.580 --> 00:24.817
What the...

00:24.818 --> 00:26.059
Hands up!

01:30.100 --> 01:31.579
Look familiar?

01:31.580 --> 01:35.299
I taped every fuckin' thing
Jimmy ever said to me.

01:56.220 --> 01:57.229
Fuck this.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.794
I'll kill him, Ray.
I'll fuckin' kill him.

02:09.289 --> 02:11.589
You're still workin'
for that piece a shit?

02:14.802 --> 02:17.136
Ugh!

02:30.520 --> 02:32.611
I shot him, he's dead.
What's the difference?

02:37.490 --> 02:39.489
God damn it, I said stop...

02:39.490 --> 02:41.449
On the ground.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.720
Donovan just flipped Judge Scholl.

02:58.721 --> 03:00.389
Son of a bitch.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.809
Aah!

06:38.970 --> 06:40.260
Uhh...

08:25.180 --> 08:27.649
Please, I-I won't say a thing!

08:27.650 --> 08:30.420
I-I swear, I won't say a fuckin' thing.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.520
Let's go.

09:07.900 --> 09:10.379
How you gonna explain this?

09:10.380 --> 09:12.844
You were never here.

09:14.140 --> 09:16.090
Try to keep my daughter off the stand?

09:16.098 --> 09:19.059
She'll be waiting for
you at the station.

09:21.830 --> 09:22.979
Thanks.

09:38.220 --> 09:39.439
One size fit all, huh?

09:39.440 --> 09:43.279
- Oh, wow!
- Hey, hey!

09:43.280 --> 09:44.579
Look at my butt!

09:44.580 --> 09:47.999
They fit me like a really
gorgeous, beautiful glove.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.964
When I tried these on...

09:57.440 --> 10:00.392
Come on, let's get outta here.

10:03.930 --> 10:05.419
I'm goin' to college.

10:05.420 --> 10:06.959
No way Mick's got money for that.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.599
I'm savin' up.

10:08.600 --> 10:09.679
Jim Sullivan is payin' you

10:09.680 --> 10:11.959
that much to watch his little brat?

10:11.960 --> 10:13.659
It's none of your fuckin' business.

10:13.660 --> 10:15.439
If I wanna go to college,
I'm gonna go to college.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.999
Jesus, fine... whatever.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.559
Socialite and philanthropist

10:19.560 --> 10:23.439
Delores Young jumped to
her death earlier today.

10:23.440 --> 10:27.789
Young had been suffering
from stage 4 ovarian cancer.

10:27.790 --> 10:29.859
Young was, as her daughter described,

10:29.860 --> 10:32.979
a fighter, not one to give up easily.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.419
In a related story,

10:34.420 --> 10:36.499
tempers flared out of control today

10:36.500 --> 10:39.699
amidst the finger-pointing...

11:19.060 --> 11:21.090
Ya all right?

11:22.700 --> 11:24.509
Yeah.

11:24.510 --> 11:27.499
Want me to take you somewhere?

11:27.500 --> 11:30.159
Someplace quiet.

11:43.420 --> 11:46.519
I don't know how to forgive him.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.239
Smitty?

11:48.240 --> 11:50.750
Yeah.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.480
What for?

11:56.580 --> 11:59.550
For what he did to our family.

12:04.340 --> 12:07.480
He was tryin' to protect you, Bridge.

12:12.320 --> 12:15.030
Maybe I don't wanna forgive him.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.115
I'm takin' ya home.

13:58.100 --> 14:01.019
- Mornin', Bunch.
- Mornin'.

14:04.150 --> 14:05.970
Now, who wants eggs?

14:08.200 --> 14:10.300
Want some?

14:18.200 --> 14:19.560
Ya all right?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.485
What?

14:21.486 --> 14:23.196
What's wrong?

14:25.960 --> 14:27.579
I'm late.

14:27.580 --> 14:29.060
Gotta go.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.979
Ya remember me?

15:45.980 --> 15:48.479
Yeah, of course.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.859
I looked you up.

15:50.860 --> 15:53.139
I-I-I don't mean to
give ya the bum rush.

15:53.140 --> 15:54.799
I-I hope it's all right.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.400
No, not at all, I...

15:56.414 --> 15:58.291
Come on in, Terry.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.879
I, uh...

16:07.880 --> 16:11.319
I met this lady... Well...

16:11.320 --> 16:14.839
We were looking for some
kinda miracle at this ashram.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.199
She was my friend,

16:17.200 --> 16:19.919
and she killed herself last night.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.039
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.749
Yeah. It's a'ight.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.539
She's in a better place.

16:26.540 --> 16:28.319
And you?

16:28.320 --> 16:31.400
- What?
- How are you?

16:35.660 --> 16:37.330
Why don't you have a seat?

16:43.800 --> 16:47.499
Uh, y-you... you fish.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.719
- I did, yeah.
- What... f-fly fishin'?

16:50.720 --> 16:51.859
Yeah.

16:51.860 --> 16:54.219
Oh, y-you... Did ya tie 'em yourself?

16:54.220 --> 16:56.439
- The flies?
- Used to.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.579
Oh... yeah, a course.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.739
Right.

17:00.740 --> 17:04.919
Yeah, I, uh... I used to
do shit like that too.

17:04.920 --> 17:09.189
One a my favorite things was
wrappin' a fighter's hands.

17:09.190 --> 17:12.378
Doin' the wraps and
the tapes just right.

17:12.380 --> 17:15.659
It's an art, wrappin' a hand...

17:15.660 --> 17:17.049
fittin' a glove.

17:17.050 --> 17:18.219
Yeah, I bet.

17:18.220 --> 17:21.459
- It's an art.
- Yeah.

17:21.460 --> 17:24.579
But this disease takes that
kinda shit away from us.

17:24.579 --> 17:27.979
It does.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.319
You know who Linda Ronstadt is?

17:30.320 --> 17:31.719
Yeah, sure, the singer.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.499
Yeah. She got Parkinson's too.
You know that?

17:33.500 --> 17:35.329
- Yeah, I read about that.
- Yeah.

17:35.330 --> 17:37.699
She's a beautiful woman.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.799
I mean, she could do anything right.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.339
With her voice.

17:41.340 --> 17:43.299
I'm not even a great music lover,

17:43.300 --> 17:45.440
but I loved her voice.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.959
And I read that she's got it.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.071
And she can't sing no more.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.759
And that made me cry...

17:56.760 --> 17:59.659
thinkin' she's lost her gift...

17:59.660 --> 18:01.998
before she lost her life.

18:03.260 --> 18:05.809
Maybe she doesn't see it that way.

18:07.780 --> 18:10.499
There's this picture that I saw once.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.719
This woman dove off the top
of the Empire State Buildin',

18:13.720 --> 18:16.119
and she landed on top a this car

18:16.120 --> 18:18.959
and she crushed the roof in.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.199
She was a beautiful woman,

18:21.200 --> 18:25.039
but she wasn't broken
or crushed or bloody.

18:25.040 --> 18:28.639
She looked like she was just
asleep on top a this car.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.959
Not even dead.

18:30.960 --> 18:34.149
Just tranquil, you know?

18:34.150 --> 18:37.619
Just restin'.

18:37.620 --> 18:40.949
How long have you been
thinking about suicide?

18:42.920 --> 18:45.239
A while.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.959
Huh.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.129
Have you talked to your
doctor about that?

18:50.130 --> 18:53.339
No.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.680
I'm talkin' to you.

19:04.435 --> 19:07.819
Okay, come on, get yourself up.

19:07.820 --> 19:10.020
You wait till everything's done, huh?

19:12.860 --> 19:15.060
You're not stupid.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.950
Auspicious.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.159
What?

19:27.160 --> 19:29.539
I just seen a robin redbreast

19:29.540 --> 19:31.086
on the branch down there.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.213
- Yeah, so?
- They're rare.

19:33.214 --> 19:36.169
It's gonna be a good day.

19:36.170 --> 19:38.120
Gonna get some coffee.

19:56.980 --> 19:59.179
Oh, thank God!

19:59.180 --> 20:00.989
Thank God you're all right!

20:00.990 --> 20:02.839
What are you doin' here?

20:02.840 --> 20:04.699
I got good news, boys.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.579
I made a deal for the papers.

20:06.580 --> 20:10.160
We're gonna be, uh... rich.

20:11.220 --> 20:13.249
So where're the... where are the papers?

20:13.250 --> 20:15.173
Talk to Ray.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.150
Uh...

20:18.160 --> 20:19.380
Ray's got 'em?

20:21.180 --> 20:23.880
What're ya doin' with him, Mick, hmm?

20:28.180 --> 20:30.259
He's family, Bunch.

20:30.260 --> 20:32.999
No, he's not.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.942
He's a fuckin' rat.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.609
Well, Smitty, you're what,
my father's new bitch now?

20:39.610 --> 20:41.880
N-no.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.419
Smitty...

20:46.420 --> 20:48.639
you're a good kid, and I like you.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.059
But if you do not get
away from my father,

20:51.060 --> 20:52.585
you are gonna end up dead.

20:52.586 --> 20:53.889
Do you understand?

20:53.890 --> 20:56.579
Please, son.

20:56.580 --> 20:58.048
That's not fair.

20:58.049 --> 21:01.489
F-fair?

21:02.520 --> 21:04.739
Wait a minute... fair?

21:06.500 --> 21:08.476
But y-you know what, you know what, Pop?

21:08.477 --> 21:10.859
You're right. It's not fair.

21:10.860 --> 21:14.039
But it's math.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.519
Close the door on your way out.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.812
You okay?

22:36.680 --> 22:38.080
Yeah.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.719
Been listening to those tapes.

22:43.720 --> 22:46.199
Yeah.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.283
There's something I
think you should hear.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.411
What?

23:00.340 --> 23:01.719
No, Jim, check this out.

23:01.720 --> 23:04.239
Gary said that she said
she went to the drugstore

23:04.240 --> 23:07.519
and got one a those,
um, uh, pregnancy tests.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.919
Who got a pregnancy test?

23:08.920 --> 23:11.019
- Gary's girlfriend?
- Yeah, what's her face, uh...

23:11.020 --> 23:13.399
- She bought a pregnancy test?
- Yeah, what's, uh...

23:13.400 --> 23:15.679
- Bridget Donovan.
- Bridget fuckin' Donovan, yeah.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.539
She's in the family way?

23:17.540 --> 23:19.499
Look, that's what Gary says, Jim.

23:19.500 --> 23:20.999
And you... you know what I told Gary?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.470
I said, "That's on her."

23:24.840 --> 23:27.530
Did you know she was pregnant?

23:34.680 --> 23:37.959
I'm so sorry, Ray.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.520
She shoulda told me.

23:59.522 --> 24:01.356
Hey, no, don't do that.

24:01.357 --> 24:04.192
- I coulda done something.
- You weren't responsible.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.487
You weren't back then, you're not now.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.490
I told her...

24:17.520 --> 24:20.500
I told her that...

24:32.340 --> 24:34.160
Hey, it's okay.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.480
It's okay.

24:40.720 --> 24:43.369
I'm here, okay?

24:43.370 --> 24:44.649
I'm here.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.359
I want to be here...

24:47.360 --> 24:49.859
around you.

24:49.860 --> 24:54.035
And I want you to stay around me.

25:05.190 --> 25:06.756
I gotta go.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.780
I don't really wanna go today.

25:35.320 --> 25:36.569
Why?

25:36.570 --> 25:39.540
I'm not feelin' so good.

25:39.550 --> 25:41.059
So?

25:41.060 --> 25:44.039
So maybe tonight's not a good night.

25:44.040 --> 25:46.299
Did ya tell him that before?

25:46.300 --> 25:47.880
No.

25:49.260 --> 25:52.239
- You're not sick.
- I got cramps.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.599
You don't just cancel on Jim Sullivan.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.859
I'm not his bitch like you, Ray.

25:56.860 --> 25:58.209
I can do whatever the fuck I want.

25:58.210 --> 26:00.100
Yeah?

26:18.360 --> 26:20.700
Get outta the fucking car, Bridge.

26:24.940 --> 26:27.269
Go to work.

26:27.270 --> 26:29.120
Right.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.950
Taxi. Over here!

27:04.280 --> 27:06.210
Taxi!

27:30.330 --> 27:32.919
Look, Jews.

27:32.920 --> 27:35.321
Yeah.

27:40.130 --> 27:41.280
Hmm.

27:48.840 --> 27:52.669
- Here, read this.
- What? It's Hebrew.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.619
No, no, right here.

27:54.620 --> 27:56.599
- Oh.
- That's the T'shuvah. That's Hebrew.

27:56.600 --> 27:59.139
Repentance.

27:59.140 --> 28:02.460
Catholics... see, we sin,

28:02.470 --> 28:05.369
and we can go to some prick
who's a worse sinner than us.

28:05.370 --> 28:06.999
But he tells us, you know,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.659
four "Our Fathers," eight "Hail Marys"

28:09.660 --> 28:12.899
and that's it, it's done.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.979
We can do that every day a the week,

28:14.980 --> 28:18.139
but Jews... they, uh,

28:18.140 --> 28:20.059
they only get one chance
a year of forgiveness.

28:20.060 --> 28:23.019
And they don't fuck around
with the middlemen.

28:23.020 --> 28:26.429
They go direct to God.
They say their worst sin

28:26.430 --> 28:29.519
direct to Him, hoping He'll
give 'em a fuckin' break.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.739
Yeah?

28:30.740 --> 28:32.520
Yeah.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.090
So do it.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.550
- Do what?
- Say your biggest sin to God.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.739
If He forgives ya...

28:43.740 --> 28:46.739
and he knows all the shit you did...

28:46.740 --> 28:49.687
after that, Bridge is a piece a cake.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.860
You'll feel better.

29:09.820 --> 29:11.749
Um, God...

29:11.750 --> 29:14.519
please forgive me.

29:16.520 --> 29:19.880
I was weak and I betrayed my family.

29:21.190 --> 29:23.719
Whoa.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.699
Well, that's... that's...

29:25.700 --> 29:28.069
That was good.

29:28.070 --> 29:30.260
That's it?

29:30.270 --> 29:32.919
Yeah, you're forgiven.

29:32.920 --> 29:36.139
And, uh, your name is written in the...

29:36.140 --> 29:38.239
in the Book a Life or
some fuckin' thing.

29:38.240 --> 29:41.280
Ha. Great.

29:47.460 --> 29:50.259
- Hey, Bridget?
- Where are you?

29:50.260 --> 29:52.579
Oh, I'm... I'm with Mickey.

29:52.580 --> 29:57.789
Can you please come home?
We need to talk.

29:57.790 --> 30:00.639
Yeah, I, uh... I... Absolutely.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.420
I can, uh, I-I'll...
I'll be right there.

30:03.580 --> 30:05.300
Good.

30:11.260 --> 30:13.400
I think it worked!

30:19.330 --> 30:21.539
Where you goin'?

30:21.540 --> 30:23.779
I'm goin' home.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.720
I'm goin' home, man.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.120
God...

30:41.400 --> 30:43.659
You know me.

30:43.660 --> 30:46.379
You know...

30:46.380 --> 30:48.479
my heart, God.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.799
Please forgive me.

30:50.800 --> 30:54.599
I done bad things, many bad things.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.299
Adultery.

30:56.300 --> 30:58.199
I sold drugs, pimped.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.960
Stole.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.880
I killed people.

31:05.540 --> 31:08.419
Uh...

31:08.420 --> 31:10.760
Please forgive me.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.879
I'm sorry if I offended Thee.

31:17.880 --> 31:20.090
Amen.

31:29.450 --> 31:31.379
Oh...

31:35.060 --> 31:37.479
Frankie Lee?

31:37.480 --> 31:39.840
The original deal fell through.

31:41.480 --> 31:42.939
Shit!

31:42.940 --> 31:44.859
But I got you a new one.

31:44.860 --> 31:47.281
- A new one?
- A tit for $25 million.

31:47.282 --> 31:49.799
$25, huh?

31:49.800 --> 31:52.779
It's less, but it's real.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.299
You wanna meet today?

31:55.300 --> 31:56.622
What time?

31:56.623 --> 31:59.792
Sunset Diner, corner of Meeker
and Monitor, five o'clock.

31:59.793 --> 32:03.380
Make it five-thirty.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.660
Ya all right?

32:28.840 --> 32:31.740
Ya wanna tell me what happened?

32:35.680 --> 32:37.440
No?

32:44.620 --> 32:47.440
You know when I first
found out about you?

32:49.600 --> 32:55.599
When Terry told me you even... existed?

32:56.940 --> 33:00.140
I didn't say nothin' for like a minute.

33:02.760 --> 33:05.439
And Terry thought...

33:05.440 --> 33:07.560
I was all upset.

33:09.900 --> 33:14.880
He said, "Bunch, you don't
ever have to see him."

33:19.680 --> 33:22.540
Ya know what I said?

33:24.640 --> 33:26.880
I said, "Not see him?"

33:29.770 --> 33:32.260
"He's my baby brother, Ter."

33:33.570 --> 33:36.539
"No matter what...

33:36.540 --> 33:40.079
he's always gonna be my baby brother."

34:03.340 --> 34:04.749
Yeah.

34:04.750 --> 34:07.749
- Been worried about you, Ray.
- Yeah?

34:07.750 --> 34:09.279
Why's that?

34:09.280 --> 34:10.918
Well, I haven't heard from you is all.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.579
You got the papers?

34:13.580 --> 34:16.199
- Yeah.
- Ha.

34:16.199 --> 34:18.350
You gonna bring 'em to me?

34:22.520 --> 34:24.958
No.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.879
Uh...

34:27.880 --> 34:31.629
Come to my office. I got 'em there.

35:44.330 --> 35:45.579
Oh, God.

35:45.580 --> 35:48.349

- I heard what you said to me.

35:48.350 --> 35:50.480
About us.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.900
I wish it were possible, Molly.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.863
You wish what were possible?

35:57.864 --> 36:01.160
To stay around you.

36:03.940 --> 36:06.489
But it's not.

36:06.490 --> 36:09.059
- Where are you?
- Doesn't matter.

36:09.060 --> 36:11.229
No, it does matter.

36:11.230 --> 36:13.209
Ray...

36:13.210 --> 36:15.960
it was my father, wasn't it?

36:18.540 --> 36:21.513

39:21.360 --> 39:23.839

42:21.010 --> 42:23.059
Don't turn around.

42:23.060 --> 42:25.719
Put the valise down.

42:25.720 --> 42:28.729
Fuck you.

42:28.730 --> 42:31.880
Put the valise on the floor, Ray.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.879
It always comes down
to money, doesn't it?

42:47.880 --> 42:50.120
I'm not gonna tell ya again, Ray.

42:53.780 --> 42:56.839
This that legacy you were talkin' about?

42:56.840 --> 42:58.200
Huh?

42:58.201 --> 43:02.299
You don't understand, huh?

43:02.300 --> 43:04.239
I did this all for you.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.820
Yeah.

43:14.680 --> 43:16.479
Did you know Bridget was pregnant

43:16.480 --> 43:18.220
when she killed herself?

43:19.490 --> 43:21.223
What?

43:21.224 --> 43:24.279
Yeah.

43:24.280 --> 43:27.188
You know Jim Sullivan was the father?

43:28.720 --> 43:29.919
Fuck.

43:29.920 --> 43:32.276
Every one of your children, Mick...

43:32.277 --> 43:37.299
left alone to be preyed on
by wild fucking animals.

43:37.300 --> 43:41.490
And for what? Huh?

43:43.880 --> 43:47.120
So you go down to E street
and get your dick sucked.

43:49.120 --> 43:52.000
So you'd have your freedom.

43:55.210 --> 43:58.500
And you thought this was
gonna make it better, huh?

44:00.460 --> 44:02.260
Money.

44:09.980 --> 44:12.939
Take it.

44:12.940 --> 44:15.999
It's fuckin' poison.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.499
No one wants it.

44:19.500 --> 44:22.452
No one wants you or
your fuckin' money, Mick.

44:53.170 --> 44:54.649
Yeah?

44:54.650 --> 44:57.239
- Mick took the stocks.
- How?

44:57.240 --> 44:58.939
Doesn't matter.

44:58.940 --> 45:00.779
I put a tracker in the briefcase.

45:00.780 --> 45:03.659
Follow it... don't let
him outta your sight.

45:08.860 --> 45:12.250
Ray wants us to follow the briefcase.

45:19.360 --> 45:21.520
You comin'?

45:37.980 --> 45:39.980
Auspicious.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.399
What?

45:43.400 --> 45:47.120
I saw a robin outside
the window this morning.

45:48.700 --> 45:50.540
Okay.

45:51.960 --> 45:55.099
Mickey said that that's auspicious.

46:00.340 --> 46:03.700
Hey, listen, um...

46:05.140 --> 46:08.359
Mickey's got somethin' that's big

46:08.360 --> 46:11.460
that could make everybody really rich.

46:14.260 --> 46:16.209
W...

46:16.210 --> 46:17.799
What? No.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.459
Yeah, we could all make so much money,

46:19.460 --> 46:21.540
we could do whatever we wanted.

46:24.440 --> 46:27.499
Just f-forget about the money.

46:27.500 --> 46:29.954
Let's just... let's-let's go somewhere.

46:31.140 --> 46:33.290
Where you wanna go?

46:34.417 --> 46:37.878
I wanna go back to Los Angeles.

46:37.879 --> 46:41.210
I wanna go home.

46:43.480 --> 46:45.819
Will you... will you do that?

46:45.820 --> 46:48.479
Will you go there with me?

46:48.480 --> 46:50.659
Yeah.

46:50.660 --> 46:53.519
Of course.

46:56.260 --> 46:58.730
I'll go anywhere with you.

47:16.120 --> 47:19.620
The NA meeting's two doors down.

47:29.070 --> 47:31.265
Who's buying the Sullivan stock?

47:32.990 --> 47:35.009
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

47:35.010 --> 47:38.840
Who's your contact for
the Sullivan stock?

47:42.700 --> 47:46.219
Look, I don't know who you are,

47:46.220 --> 47:47.929
- or what you want...
- I'm sorry, I...

47:47.930 --> 47:50.451
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Declan Sullivan.

47:50.452 --> 47:53.949
Yeah, you recognize the name?

47:53.950 --> 47:57.875
I'm here to find the man
who stole from my father.

48:01.340 --> 48:03.709
Are we clear?

49:41.970 --> 49:44.719
This the best you could do?

49:44.720 --> 49:47.539
Tequila warehouse in Greenpoint?

49:49.270 --> 49:52.680
You want, Ray, I got a lotta
space I could give ya.

49:53.760 --> 49:56.200
I like it here.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.205
You get the papers?

50:02.960 --> 50:04.919
Well done.

50:04.920 --> 50:08.689
Well done, Ray. Well fuckin' done.

50:08.690 --> 50:10.059
Ha ha.

50:10.060 --> 50:11.919
We gotta...

50:11.920 --> 50:13.079
we gotta go out.

50:13.080 --> 50:15.559
We gotta go out, uh, celebrate.

50:15.560 --> 50:16.846
Over to Luger's.

50:16.847 --> 50:19.389
Sure.

50:19.390 --> 50:22.059
Well...

50:22.060 --> 50:25.329

give 'em to me or not?

50:25.330 --> 50:26.732
The papers.

50:30.380 --> 50:34.169
You read that review in
"The Times" about Luger's?

50:34.170 --> 50:35.809
I mean, Jesus Christ,

50:35.810 --> 50:38.539
how do you give the best
steakhouse in the country

50:38.540 --> 50:40.399
zero stars?

50:40.400 --> 50:44.239
How they... how they...
I mean, that elitist fuck.

50:44.240 --> 50:46.979
What does a... what does
a guy like that know

50:46.980 --> 50:49.999
about steak, you know?

50:50.000 --> 50:53.959
I mean, maybe, uh,
truffle-coated cockroach balls

50:53.960 --> 50:58.040
or some shit like that
but, uh, not steak.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.219
The only problem with, uh,

51:01.220 --> 51:03.819
the only problem with... with Luger's

51:03.820 --> 51:06.959
is gettin' a reservation, you know?

51:06.960 --> 51:08.869
Ha.

51:08.870 --> 51:11.779
I kn-I know... but I know a guy.

51:11.780 --> 51:13.079
A teamster.

51:13.080 --> 51:14.697
What the fuck is that for?

51:16.180 --> 51:18.150
What'd you do to my sister, Jim?

51:18.159 --> 51:20.870
What?

51:22.220 --> 51:25.291
I-I don't know what the
fuck you're talkin' about.

51:28.544 --> 51:31.139
Come on.

51:31.140 --> 51:33.279
Gimme the gun.

51:33.280 --> 51:35.925
Kid, gimme the gun.

51:35.926 --> 51:38.638
What'd you do to her?

51:40.820 --> 51:42.140
Look, Ray,

51:42.141 --> 51:44.351

53:24.720 --> 53:26.399
Things are workin' out, huh?

53:29.220 --> 53:31.110
So you found Ray?

53:31.120 --> 53:32.789
Yeah.

53:32.790 --> 53:35.329
And he just gave it to you?

53:35.330 --> 53:37.010
Pffft.

53:38.760 --> 53:41.219
Well...

53:41.220 --> 53:43.279
well, you got it.

53:43.280 --> 53:45.264
That's what's important.

53:48.760 --> 53:50.680
Hey.

53:52.021 --> 53:55.139
What's goin' on?

53:55.140 --> 53:58.039
Nothing comes without a price.

53:58.040 --> 54:00.499
Nothing.

54:00.500 --> 54:03.179
But I was brought back to life

54:03.180 --> 54:05.576
to bring my family back to life.

54:12.910 --> 54:16.170
There it is. Let's go.

54:35.360 --> 54:37.570
So what do you got?

54:41.240 --> 54:43.780
Ah, there it is.

54:43.781 --> 54:46.009
Yeah, ha ha, yeah.

54:46.010 --> 54:48.259
That's... good.

54:48.260 --> 54:50.500
Now yours.

54:53.060 --> 54:55.539
Ya look familiar.

54:55.540 --> 54:58.309
Do I know you?

55:10.780 --> 55:12.939
Let's just exchange the fuckin' valises

55:12.940 --> 55:15.228
and get the fuck outta here. Come on.

55:15.229 --> 55:16.939
Kevin.

55:19.190 --> 55:20.568
Hand that stuff over.

55:20.570 --> 55:22.318
Fuck you, Declan!

55:24.446 --> 55:25.990
Hand it the fuck over!

55:56.270 --> 55:58.359
You did this.

55:58.360 --> 56:00.360
You.

56:03.235 --> 56:05.029
Daryll!
