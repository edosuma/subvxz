A NETFLIX SERIES

00:30.458 --> 00:33.458
DOCTOR BELDA GUZMÁN
GENERAL MEDICINE

00:38.500 --> 00:39.416
Yes.

00:39.916 --> 00:40.916
Yes, I see.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.291
It was the only option.

00:44.583 --> 00:45.541
Of course.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.291
Yeah. Don't worry about a thing.

00:51.333 --> 00:52.333
Yes.

00:53.583 --> 00:55.791
The right idea was
moving her to the hospital.

00:56.958 --> 00:58.291
Thanks for telling me.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.208
He's chosen me.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.666
<i>The altar is the gate to the kingdom.</i>

01:24.125 --> 01:25.958
Only a perfect one can open it.

01:27.208 --> 01:29.916
When the blood
of a human sacrifice touches the stone,

01:30.500 --> 01:32.416
the perfect one performs the fifth veil,

01:33.333 --> 01:35.291
calling forth the Solitary King.

01:36.291 --> 01:37.291
Great.

01:42.083 --> 01:43.875
There are smoldering coal seams.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.083
But I doubt the fumes
are what killed them.

01:50.958 --> 01:52.291
Cuéllar, calm down.

01:52.791 --> 01:53.916
Put your mask on.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.541
Listen. Put your mask on.

01:55.625 --> 01:58.333
-I can't breathe!
-You're wearing an oxygen tank.

01:58.416 --> 02:00.500
If you put on your mask,
you'll be able to.

02:01.291 --> 02:02.291
Cuéllar.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.666
Iruña, keep an eye on Pablo.

02:06.750 --> 02:08.583
Come on, let's go.

02:11.666 --> 02:12.666
Cuéllar.

02:15.250 --> 02:16.625
Calm the fuck down.

02:17.416 --> 02:18.750
Cuéllar. Hey, Cuéllar.

02:20.125 --> 02:21.125
You okay?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.208
-My head's gonna explode!
-Take it easy.

02:25.125 --> 02:27.500
Is everyone here?
Make sure no one's still in there.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.916
Somebody please stop that noise!
Somebody stop it!

03:34.291 --> 03:35.375
I'm sorry.

03:36.916 --> 03:38.541
Really. For not believing you.

03:39.708 --> 03:40.791
It's okay.

03:42.583 --> 03:44.166
You've always been there for me.

03:45.166 --> 03:47.041
Turns out I was wrong too.

03:50.875 --> 03:51.958
But…

03:52.625 --> 03:54.500
that thing we saw is gone, right?

03:54.583 --> 03:55.625
It won't come back?

03:57.208 --> 03:58.875
If it's not Dekta, it'll be another one.

04:01.125 --> 04:02.125
Umma,

04:02.791 --> 04:03.916
Khiaram,

04:04.000 --> 04:05.083
Brantas…

04:06.416 --> 04:08.666
Any one of the powers
that rule the kingdom.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.041
It's too late now, Eva.

04:12.708 --> 04:14.500
They'll take me to the temple.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.500
There must be a way to stop them.

04:20.916 --> 04:22.416
Why didn't you do anything to me?

04:23.750 --> 04:25.416
Why didn't you stab me?

04:29.083 --> 04:30.375
Because I love you.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.125
They won't beat us.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.541
Mom told me from the start,

04:47.125 --> 04:48.583
"Go, Sofía."

04:49.500 --> 04:51.875
Saint John's Eve was
the first time I saw her.

04:51.958 --> 04:52.875
Where?

04:54.250 --> 04:56.875
The path to the kingdom,
but I didn't know it yet.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.375
Then the others showed up.

05:02.041 --> 05:03.125
Samuel,

05:04.333 --> 05:05.291
Blanca.

05:06.250 --> 05:08.541
They said only the kingdom was real.

05:09.041 --> 05:11.666
That I had to open
the gates to be with her.

05:11.750 --> 05:12.958
And, Eva,

05:13.041 --> 05:14.708
Mom was there.

05:17.791 --> 05:19.375
I've had Dekta inside me.

05:21.083 --> 05:22.666
It brings nothing but pain.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.541
It's like a fire.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.166
It burns.

05:27.666 --> 05:31.750
When I looked at you, the fire made me
hate you with all my might.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.625
He was using you, Sofía.

05:38.458 --> 05:40.083
There is no better place.

05:42.666 --> 05:44.458
Mom is trapped in hell…

05:45.541 --> 05:47.666
And there's nothing I can do to help her.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.041
If Dad was telling the truth,

05:56.416 --> 05:58.000
then it was her decision.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.166
She threw herself in there for us.

06:01.958 --> 06:03.375
So that we'd be safe.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.833
So we owe it to her, all right?

06:09.291 --> 06:10.708
We have to be okay.

06:11.916 --> 06:12.916
Together.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.333
Like two balls in a nutsack.

06:21.458 --> 06:23.791
It's all right. Take it easy.

06:26.333 --> 06:30.458
<i>"Men think</i> <i>the kingdom has come</i>
<i>to sow peace in our world."</i>

06:33.791 --> 06:37.541
"But they do not know that it has come
to sow division on Earth."

06:39.583 --> 06:43.666
"Fire, sword, and war."

06:52.583 --> 06:53.916
Why am I tied down?

07:00.916 --> 07:03.000
We don't want you to hurt yourself again.

07:05.166 --> 07:06.375
How are you feeling?

07:08.833 --> 07:09.916
It's not in me.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.958
There is nothing in you, Blanca.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.500
Who told you there was?

07:16.291 --> 07:17.291
Samuel?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.541
He's in custody, just like the others.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.666
They can't hurt you anymore.

07:23.333 --> 07:26.666
I wanted to have Dekta inside me.

07:27.916 --> 07:30.875
Very few can be the vessel,
and he chose me.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.000
I thought it would end my pain.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.416
Make me forget who I am.

07:41.125 --> 07:42.750
All the things I've lost.

07:47.541 --> 07:48.583
Where are you from?

07:53.291 --> 07:56.125
I should've stayed with my daughter,
and I let her die alone.

08:00.041 --> 08:01.458
I let her die alone.

08:03.791 --> 08:06.125
-I let her die alone.
-Easy, Blanca.

08:06.208 --> 08:07.583
-I left her alone.
-Calm down.

08:07.666 --> 08:08.916
-Relax.
-I left her alone.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
-It'll be okay. I promise.
-I left her alone.

08:11.083 --> 08:13.375
-I'm going to get the doctor.
-I left her alone.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.958
I left her alone.

08:17.625 --> 08:18.875
I left her alone!

08:52.458 --> 08:55.583
Twenty years ago, we thought
we'd put an end to the cult.

08:56.583 --> 08:58.375
I blew up the mine's galleries.

08:59.958 --> 09:00.958
But they came back.

09:02.166 --> 09:05.250
<i>They must've been working</i>
<i>for a long time to reopen the tunnel.</i>

09:05.958 --> 09:08.458
<i>Elena had been getting letters for years.</i>

09:09.250 --> 09:10.791
<i>There were still followers.</i>

09:13.916 --> 09:16.000
They threatened our daughters.

09:17.666 --> 09:19.500
Running away wasn't an option.

09:21.875 --> 09:23.916
You can laugh at me if you want.

09:24.625 --> 09:27.583
But the kingdom's power
would have found us anyway.

09:28.916 --> 09:32.541
Elena knew that if she performed the rite,
the gates would open.

09:33.041 --> 09:35.333
Everything on the other side
would enter our world.

09:35.958 --> 09:37.291
So she crossed the altar.

09:37.791 --> 09:38.916
It was suicide.

09:39.916 --> 09:41.291
She was the key.

09:41.375 --> 09:43.916
Without her, the gate couldn't be opened.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.708
But she was wrong.

09:47.375 --> 09:48.833
Sofía is like her mother.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.333
She's a perfect one.

10:00.416 --> 10:01.416
Cuéllar?

10:01.916 --> 10:03.208
Why's your mask off?

10:03.875 --> 10:05.958
Come on, man. You should get out of here.

10:06.916 --> 10:07.916
Cuéllar?

10:08.583 --> 10:09.583
Can you hear me?

10:11.166 --> 10:12.500
Hey.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.500
What are you doing? No!

10:18.333 --> 10:19.416
Fuck!

10:19.500 --> 10:21.250
-Come on. Get up.
-No.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.125
-No.
-There you go. Calm down.

10:23.208 --> 10:26.250
Give me the gun!
I need to offer it my blood.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.791
-Calm down.
-I need to offer it my blood!

11:10.208 --> 11:12.041
Sofía, what's wrong?

11:12.125 --> 11:14.041
Sofía, it's me. What's wrong?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.750
It's coming for me!

11:18.583 --> 11:21.000
-It was just a bad dream.
-The blood opened the gate.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.291
Calm down.

11:22.375 --> 11:26.416
The laundry loading dock is
to the left of the hospital's entrance.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.875
Getting in will be easy.

11:28.458 --> 11:29.458
When?

11:34.916 --> 11:36.166
He will tell us.

11:38.583 --> 11:39.916
What if there isn't anything?

11:40.416 --> 11:43.000
Goran left me a message telling me to run.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.458
I don't know what he might've seen, but…

11:47.375 --> 11:50.458
What if it's better
for those gates to stay closed?

11:55.458 --> 11:58.291
There is no greater crime
than having knowledge

11:58.791 --> 11:59.958
and rejecting it.

12:04.083 --> 12:05.833
Are you going to be a traitor?

12:08.166 --> 12:10.166
<i>He looks to make a short pass, and he…</i>

12:10.250 --> 12:13.708
Lieutenant, the results of the tests
they ran when you came out of the mine.

12:15.041 --> 12:16.375
Where are my results?

12:16.458 --> 12:18.458
Hey, can someone turn that damn radio off?

12:18.541 --> 12:20.291
Turn the radio off!

12:22.125 --> 12:25.541
-Are you going back to the temple?
-No. I want to go to the hospital.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.166
Maybe I can get Blanca to talk.

12:28.250 --> 12:30.541
Estrella spoke with her. She's lost it.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.958
She says if Sofía opens the gates,
it'll be the end of the world.

12:34.041 --> 12:35.500
She believes it. Like Pablo.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.541
-You have a call from the hospital.
-What about?

12:38.625 --> 12:41.000
Personal. I'll put it through
to your office.

12:43.458 --> 12:46.291
-Hello?
-<i>Hello. Good afternoon. This is Dr. Alba.</i>

12:46.791 --> 12:50.125
<i>We have the lab results.</i>

12:50.208 --> 12:52.916
<i>The results of the other officers</i>
<i>aren't cause for worry,</i>

12:54.125 --> 12:58.041
<i>but in your case, there are levels</i>
<i>I'd like to talk about in person.</i>

12:58.750 --> 13:02.916
<i>It wasn't what we were looking for,</i>
<i>but you should come to the hospital.</i>

13:04.666 --> 13:05.791
<i>Lieutenant?</i>

13:07.125 --> 13:08.458
<i>Lieutenant, are you there?</i>

13:20.916 --> 13:21.750
Where are they?

13:22.583 --> 13:23.583
In the bathroom.

13:24.083 --> 13:26.916
Sofía had a bad dream
and needed to clear her head.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.750
<i>You were right</i>
<i>when you said I should tell you the truth.</i>

13:36.250 --> 13:39.250
I've tried everything but the truth.

13:39.916 --> 13:41.333
Where was I adopted from?

13:49.083 --> 13:50.875
I met this priest in Madrid.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.208
We gave him 300,000 pesetas, and he…

13:56.375 --> 13:59.875
Candela went away for a bit,
and when she came back, she had you.

14:04.791 --> 14:06.750
Why'd you wait so long to tell me?

14:10.791 --> 14:12.375
When your mother was young,

14:13.208 --> 14:15.125
she joined the Cult of Light.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.125
I went to a few ceremonies too.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.375
It was… a religious group.

14:21.458 --> 14:25.583
It wasn't much different
from what the priest said at Mass.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.750
Was Mom still in the cult?

14:31.083 --> 14:32.458
There was this ceremony…

14:35.833 --> 14:37.500
It's hard to describe it

14:38.500 --> 14:41.875
because… I don't know what was real

14:43.208 --> 14:44.791
and what was a vision.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.750
But there was something…

14:48.833 --> 14:50.916
A thing not of this world.

14:51.708 --> 14:56.375
It got inside Candela, and…
when we went to the doctor, he told us

14:56.875 --> 14:58.708
she had lost her uterus.

15:00.708 --> 15:02.041
It's the truth.

15:02.666 --> 15:03.541
Believe me.

15:04.125 --> 15:05.125
I know.

15:07.291 --> 15:10.125
We were so close to the devil.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.500
That devil is back.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.708
Stay away from Eva.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.958
Her family was with them back then
and still are now.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.333
No. Talk to Sofía.

15:23.041 --> 15:24.416
Tell her everything.

15:26.416 --> 15:29.166
Please. She needs to hear it.

16:07.583 --> 16:09.208
When are you gonna quit smoking?

16:11.375 --> 16:13.375
You really think now's the best time?

16:15.666 --> 16:18.375
It's either smoke or pop pills.
You tell me.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.666
Holy shit, Mar.

16:25.166 --> 16:27.000
-You scared me.
-Sorry.

16:27.916 --> 16:29.333
My father is here.

16:30.375 --> 16:31.833
Maybe he can help you.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.125
I don't see how.

16:35.041 --> 16:38.333
-I'd rather not see him.
-Eva, hear him out. It can't hurt.

16:39.708 --> 16:40.916
What are you doing?

16:41.541 --> 16:42.791
Wait outside.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.041
Before your mother joined the cult,

17:01.375 --> 17:03.208
your grandfather Valentín was in it.

17:03.291 --> 17:05.791
He's the one
who found the temple in the mine.

17:06.291 --> 17:07.583
Know what I'm talking about?

17:09.416 --> 17:10.916
Lozano, you can't be in here.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.083
I've been to that temple.

17:14.750 --> 17:17.083
The black altar is like a gate.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.916
But not just anyone can unlock it.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.750
Not even Valentín could.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.291
It has to be a woman.

17:25.458 --> 17:26.541
A perfect one.

17:27.041 --> 17:28.083
Like my mother.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.458
And like you, Sofía.

17:33.125 --> 17:34.625
And this is the only way

17:34.708 --> 17:36.041
to keep it closed.

17:36.583 --> 17:37.875
Dad, what are you doing? No!

17:39.666 --> 17:40.916
This isn't what I want.

17:42.041 --> 17:43.791
-But it's God's will.
-Dad.

17:48.625 --> 17:50.375
Don't. Please.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.166
-She's just a girl.
-I'm sorry.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.541
But you're the key.

18:02.291 --> 18:03.333
Let him go!

18:06.291 --> 18:08.750
Let him go! Raúl, please!

18:08.833 --> 18:11.833
Let him go!

18:11.916 --> 18:15.375
No!

18:21.958 --> 18:22.916
Stop!

18:25.916 --> 18:27.708
Dad!

18:35.208 --> 18:36.333
What have you done?

18:36.416 --> 18:38.250
-Why won't the noise stop?
-Dad!

18:39.708 --> 18:40.708
Dad.

18:41.291 --> 18:42.625
Why won't it stop?

18:52.666 --> 18:54.791
Handle the paperwork. I'll be there later.

18:54.875 --> 18:55.916
Okay, Lieutenant.

18:56.416 --> 18:58.625
All right, kid. Watch your head.

19:34.333 --> 19:37.458
We'll put an officer
outside your room to keep people out.

19:39.666 --> 19:41.833
-Where's Mar?
-With Estrella.

19:41.916 --> 19:44.666
She had some papers to fill out,
but she's in good hands.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.500
You can see her in a bit.

19:50.708 --> 19:51.916
How are you?

19:54.375 --> 19:55.416
Tired.

19:58.791 --> 20:00.000
I hear that.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.375
What you're going through, it's…

20:10.541 --> 20:12.041
Sometimes I think it's

20:13.125 --> 20:16.208
like when you have a high fever as a kid.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.416
I'm talking over 40 degrees.
I'm sure you've had one.

20:20.833 --> 20:23.458
You can't tell what's real and what's not.

20:25.416 --> 20:28.875
Your whole body aches,
and you feel like it'll go on forever.

20:32.041 --> 20:33.208
But it doesn't.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.833
One day the fever breaks,

20:36.750 --> 20:38.875
and things go back to normal.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Life wins.

20:42.125 --> 20:43.916
What if I don't want life to win?

20:44.958 --> 20:46.833
Don't talk like that. Please, Sofía.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.708
My mother is dead.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.166
Chisco is in a coma.

20:54.916 --> 20:56.375
And my father is in jail.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.041
Today it was Lozano.

20:59.541 --> 21:01.625
But tomorrow, it'll be someone else.

21:02.625 --> 21:04.791
Because apparently all this is my fault.

21:06.208 --> 21:07.875
How's it your fault?

21:13.250 --> 21:14.791
You've lost a lot.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.833
Too much for someone your age.

21:19.041 --> 21:20.291
But look beside you.

21:22.083 --> 21:25.166
Look at your sister
and tell me she's not worth fighting for.

21:25.666 --> 21:28.708
-I don't know if I have the strength.
-Sure you do.

21:29.666 --> 21:34.208
Sofía, I've never met anyone stronger.

21:52.458 --> 21:54.166
Why don't you come to my office?

21:56.333 --> 21:58.458
We can talk about the results there.

22:01.916 --> 22:03.458
Where can I find Blanca?

22:04.166 --> 22:05.958
I'd like to know if she's awake.

22:11.166 --> 22:12.583
Your dinner's here.

22:19.875 --> 22:21.375
Don't call the officers. Please.

22:21.458 --> 22:23.666
Hear me out first.
Just listen to me, please.

22:24.166 --> 22:25.375
-Like hell I will.
-Please.

22:25.458 --> 22:26.458
Eva!

22:27.083 --> 22:28.083
Hold on.

22:36.583 --> 22:39.250
He wants me to take you
to the temple to finish the path.

22:39.333 --> 22:40.541
Belda. The doctor.

22:40.625 --> 22:43.000
-Belda?
-He's been with the cult all along.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.708
We have to tell the lieutenant.

22:44.791 --> 22:45.875
So he can do what?

22:46.833 --> 22:48.541
There's no point in arresting him.

22:54.375 --> 22:55.416
Sofía.

22:57.083 --> 22:59.166
Why'd you apologize in the temple?

23:04.458 --> 23:06.583
My brother is dead, isn't he?

23:09.583 --> 23:11.208
No one went through the gate.

23:13.583 --> 23:14.750
It was for the best.

23:16.666 --> 23:18.250
The other side is hell.

23:27.041 --> 23:27.958
Séller.

23:28.458 --> 23:29.541
Good evening.

23:35.333 --> 23:36.541
Where's Blanca?

23:37.541 --> 23:39.000
Where is Blanca?

23:39.500 --> 23:43.125
-I've been here the whole time.
-What happened to the patient?

23:43.875 --> 23:44.750
Jesus Christ.

23:56.041 --> 23:57.166
Blanca!

24:00.416 --> 24:01.458
Freeze!

24:14.250 --> 24:15.458
Out of my way!

24:25.458 --> 24:26.750
Freeze!

24:31.291 --> 24:32.541
Freeze, dammit!

24:40.458 --> 24:41.416
Fucking freeze!

25:02.125 --> 25:04.666
-Don't touch me!
-Blanca, I don't wanna hurt you.

25:05.333 --> 25:07.166
-Blanca!
-Don't touch me!

25:07.250 --> 25:08.708
Stop moving, dammit!

25:13.000 --> 25:14.583
We're going back to the hospital.

25:15.083 --> 25:17.208
I'm going to cuff you.
Are you gonna behave?

25:22.583 --> 25:23.750
All right. Easy.

25:52.291 --> 25:53.291
Hold me.

25:53.833 --> 25:56.708
Please don't let him come back. Please.

25:57.291 --> 25:59.166
What the hell was that?

26:00.125 --> 26:02.750
You're dying. Dekta can't touch you.

26:07.250 --> 26:08.458
Don't let go of me.

26:08.541 --> 26:10.791
I'm right here. Don't worry.

27:01.583 --> 27:03.083
The noise stopped.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.708
I should be happy, you know, Pablo?

27:57.458 --> 28:00.291
After fumbling in the dark for so long,
I finally get it.

28:03.541 --> 28:05.333
I know what you did in that mine.

28:11.458 --> 28:13.500
And I know why Sandra killed Ezcaray.

28:18.291 --> 28:20.583
Though I'd rather not know.

28:24.875 --> 28:26.458
So what's your explanation?

28:30.041 --> 28:31.125
Same as yours.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.750
Those demons exist.

28:41.083 --> 28:42.083
So…

28:47.708 --> 28:49.083
What convinced you?

28:51.125 --> 28:55.041
After we got back from the temple,
I had blood work done like everyone else.

28:58.666 --> 29:00.750
It has nothing to do with this, but…

29:03.583 --> 29:05.750
they told me I have leukemia.

29:07.291 --> 29:08.458
I'm dying.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.500
I'm sorry.

29:14.916 --> 29:18.083
Dekta, or whatever the hell his name his,

29:18.666 --> 29:20.291
he can't come near me

29:21.708 --> 29:23.333
because I'm dying.

29:24.208 --> 29:27.250
I'm like a kind of poison to him.

29:29.875 --> 29:31.541
He left when he saw me.

29:31.625 --> 29:33.958
Maybe he's even dead, and it's over.

29:34.041 --> 29:35.458
It's never over, Guillén.

29:36.541 --> 29:38.083
Don't you get it?

29:40.291 --> 29:41.625
When Dekta's gone,

29:42.625 --> 29:43.708
others will come.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.041
And they'll be far worse.

29:48.041 --> 29:50.333
They'll be something
we can't even imagine.

29:51.625 --> 29:53.166
Let me see Sofía.

30:05.458 --> 30:07.916
He was my father. I loved him.

30:08.750 --> 30:10.750
Of course you loved him.

30:11.416 --> 30:12.416
Your mother too.

30:13.708 --> 30:15.708
I couldn't even go home.

30:17.208 --> 30:19.416
How do I face all the memories there?

30:21.583 --> 30:25.166
From now on,
those memories are all you have.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.458
Maybe my mother will get better.

30:40.291 --> 30:41.458
No, Mar.

30:42.291 --> 30:44.125
Candela isn't getting better.

30:45.125 --> 30:47.166
And that connection you have with Eva,

30:47.666 --> 30:48.916
it won't last.

30:49.875 --> 30:51.333
You're an orphan.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.541
From now on, no one will care about you.

30:55.375 --> 30:56.916
Why would you say that?

31:42.416 --> 31:43.750
Hello?

32:20.666 --> 32:23.250
No, no, no…

32:31.958 --> 32:33.250
Eva!

32:38.000 --> 32:39.333
Was that Mar?

32:40.500 --> 32:41.833
I didn't hear anything.

32:57.208 --> 32:58.208
Dad.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.250
-They let you go.
-Yeah.

33:07.750 --> 33:10.666
I just got here.
Guillén brought me. Where's Sofía?

33:10.750 --> 33:11.916
In her room.

33:12.833 --> 33:15.125
There's supposed to be an officer here.

33:15.625 --> 33:16.916
Anyway, Dad.

33:17.666 --> 33:20.500
We have to talk.
So many things have happened.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.375
I saw it.

33:24.250 --> 33:25.750
That thing was inside Sofía.

33:25.833 --> 33:27.583
Will you shut the hell up?

33:29.333 --> 33:31.541
You're the black sheep of this family.

33:32.791 --> 33:36.333
Your mother and sister are perfect ones.
And what are you?

33:37.708 --> 33:38.708
What are you?

33:39.333 --> 33:42.000
A shrill fucking voice that won't shut up.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.041
But--

33:59.333 --> 34:00.333
It's here…

34:01.416 --> 34:02.458
There's something near.

34:08.375 --> 34:09.375
Umma.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.000
I don't know why I know.

34:17.083 --> 34:18.833
I can't keep running away.

34:31.958 --> 34:32.958
Do it, Halid.

34:36.333 --> 34:37.583
Kill me, Halid.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.041
Do it, Halid!

34:40.125 --> 34:41.125
Please!

34:41.666 --> 34:43.250
Don't let them take me to the temple.

34:50.875 --> 34:52.333
If you won't, I will.

35:24.416 --> 35:26.541
Are you okay? Can I help you get up?

35:26.625 --> 35:29.166
-Come on.
-Are you all right, miss?

35:30.208 --> 35:31.208
Did you faint?

35:31.916 --> 35:32.916
You did?

35:33.875 --> 35:36.666
-Mar, are you okay?
-I don't know what happened.

35:40.166 --> 35:41.166
Sofía!

36:01.875 --> 36:02.708
What happened?

36:02.791 --> 36:04.041
-My sister's gone.
-What?

36:04.125 --> 36:07.291
-My dad showed up at the hospital, and--
-What are you talking about?

36:07.375 --> 36:09.083
Pablo's in custody.

36:10.708 --> 36:13.583
Halid must've taken my sister to the mine.

36:15.291 --> 36:16.291
Let's go. Get in.

36:54.916 --> 36:55.750
Good afternoon.

36:55.833 --> 36:57.458
Why did you bring me here?

36:58.583 --> 37:00.708
Don't you see what's going to happen?

37:00.791 --> 37:02.583
They're from the TV station.

37:03.083 --> 37:05.583
They came to take some photos and…

37:06.166 --> 37:08.166
What happens after the fifth veil?

37:10.833 --> 37:12.041
Hell.

37:16.416 --> 37:17.875
Can you run?

37:20.125 --> 37:21.500
Umma was in the hospital.

37:21.583 --> 37:23.875
We couldn't do anything there,
but now we can.

37:24.708 --> 37:25.916
It's not here.

37:26.625 --> 37:28.750
Can you run or not?

37:31.791 --> 37:34.375
I'll take care of Belda. Come on.

37:34.875 --> 37:36.791
Belda. Belda, please listen.

37:36.875 --> 37:38.166
Please calm down.

37:38.250 --> 37:41.208
-There's no use running away.
-Listen to me. Please!

37:44.000 --> 37:45.541
The kingdom is here.

38:33.958 --> 38:35.291
Stay there.

38:40.833 --> 38:41.791
Halid.

38:43.041 --> 38:45.208
He took Sofía to the temple.

38:45.291 --> 38:47.125
I swear I didn't want to.

38:47.208 --> 38:49.291
He took her to the temple.

38:50.166 --> 38:51.958
He took Sofía.

38:52.458 --> 38:53.458
Sofía.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.333
Stay with him. Keep pressure
on the wound to slow the bleeding.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.250
Where's Sofía?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.500
Eva, stay here!

39:24.375 --> 39:26.000
Don't give up, Sofía.

39:26.083 --> 39:27.666
The path ends here.

39:30.250 --> 39:31.625
Umma will protect us.

40:18.375 --> 40:19.958
No!

41:04.500 --> 41:06.125
I won't open the last veil.

41:06.833 --> 41:08.000
You can't make me.

42:06.708 --> 42:07.708
Sofía!

42:09.375 --> 42:12.875
Eva? I told you to wait outside.
It caved in. We can't get through.

42:12.958 --> 42:14.541
-Where's Sofía?
-On the other side.

42:14.625 --> 42:15.625
We have to get out.

42:15.708 --> 42:17.583
-No! Sofía!
-Eva, please.

42:18.208 --> 42:19.791
No! Sofía!

42:39.208 --> 42:40.750
I won't open the gate!

42:41.250 --> 42:42.416
I won't do it!

43:02.708 --> 43:03.583
Help me!

43:04.791 --> 43:06.291
Help me! We have to get her out!

43:06.375 --> 43:07.416
-Eva.
-Help me!

43:07.500 --> 43:09.000
-Help me!
-We need to leave.

43:09.083 --> 43:12.041
-Please.
-Eva, we need to get out of here. Listen.

43:12.125 --> 43:14.291
-Sofía!
-Eva, we have to go.

43:15.750 --> 43:18.416
It's okay. Easy.

43:18.500 --> 43:21.291
No! Help me, please.

43:21.375 --> 43:22.833
-It's okay.
-Sofía!

43:22.916 --> 43:24.458
Calm down. Okay.

43:24.541 --> 43:26.916
No!

43:27.000 --> 43:28.625
Okay, Eva. Calm down.

43:30.916 --> 43:32.000
Relax.

43:36.083 --> 43:37.083
Honey.

43:37.666 --> 43:38.833
Don't do it.

43:39.333 --> 43:40.583
Honey.

43:42.125 --> 43:43.333
My little girl.

43:44.875 --> 43:45.875
No.

43:48.875 --> 43:49.875
My darling.

43:51.208 --> 43:52.416
I love you.

43:54.291 --> 43:55.458
Don't leave me.

43:59.458 --> 44:00.458
Mom…

44:02.541 --> 44:04.958
I don't know what the kingdom will bring,

44:05.625 --> 44:07.750
but I know one thing for sure.

44:09.458 --> 44:11.041
We will be together.

44:20.541 --> 44:22.625
I need to hold you.

44:27.916 --> 44:28.875
Me too.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.500
Come.

44:31.916 --> 44:32.916
Come.

44:35.208 --> 44:36.291
My darling.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.083
Come with me.

44:46.083 --> 44:47.083
My darling.

44:50.958 --> 44:53.083
I don't want to be alone anymore.

45:29.708 --> 45:31.916
Solitary King, bond of blindness,

45:32.875 --> 45:34.666
unconscious oblivion,

45:37.041 --> 45:39.250
I greet you, first power.

45:43.625 --> 45:47.583
In thy presence,
I am the perfect one who has been sent.

45:49.916 --> 45:53.666
I… who am part of the light.

46:03.333 --> 46:04.916
Open the final veil.

46:52.041 --> 46:53.958
"WHEN WILL THE REPOSE
OF THE DEAD COME TO BE,

46:54.041 --> 46:55.708
AND WHEN WILL THE NEW WORLD COME?"

46:55.791 --> 46:59.666
HE SAID, "WHAT YOU AWAIT HAS COME,
BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW IT." PURPLE GOSPEL
