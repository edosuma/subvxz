-Hey, evan.

Well, not exactly like that.

You're a teacher.

I'm pretty clumsy with words.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.151
Could you tell connor
I was here?

Afghanistan.

Is it that obvious?

10:47.714 --> 10:49.614
I served in iraq.

I still tie my shoelaces

call it quits...

12:03.256 --> 12:05.323
I would totally understand.

I'd kiss you again

That is interesting.

What is interesting?

13:04.584 --> 13:06.951
Well, he didn't say anything

Catt damon or levar purrton.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.596
Oh! Right.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.965
And, secondly,

why not give him
a more respectable cat name--

16:09.169 --> 16:10.501
like felix?

"felix."

Now, thirdly,
he just wandered in here, sir.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.109
We should put the word out

16:18.178 --> 16:20.111
in case he belongs
to one of the neighbors.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.846
You're right.
Hey! He chose one.

16:21.881 --> 16:25.817
Mm. Evidently canned albacore
is his meal of choice.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.218
He's got good taste.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.319
Well, the fact that he wandered
through your window

16:28.355 --> 16:29.620
indicates that he knows

16:29.656 --> 16:31.189
which side his proverbial bread
is buttered on.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.623
Don't be a cynic, mandrake.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.425
I do have that tendency.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.294
Sir, might you be using this cat

16:36.329 --> 16:38.463
as a distraction to think
about your next move?

16:38.531 --> 16:41.065
You are perceptive

16:41.101 --> 16:42.934
Abby left me that voicemail

16:43.003 --> 16:45.303
before I saw her

16:45.338 --> 16:47.538
She must be wondering why
I didn't say anything about it.

16:47.574 --> 16:48.806
Very likely.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.541
What do I do?
I can't call her this morning.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.509
She's worried
about her brother.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.477
That's true.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.145
But if I wait too long,

16:54.180 --> 16:55.413
she'll think
I'm avoiding the issue,

16:55.448 --> 16:57.515
that I'm not interested--
but I am.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.250
It's a predicament, sir.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.219

17:01.254 --> 17:04.956
so dad says that connor

I can't believe it's only been,
what, like, nine hours?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.395
Mm. I don't even know.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.065
Makes you think.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.967
I don't like
to think about that.

Still...

17:20.173 --> 17:22.340
...Every day is a gift.

It does put things
in perspective.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.112
Like all the little things
that we were worried about

17:28.181 --> 17:29.614
seem pretty insignificant.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.249

17:59.646 --> 18:01.512

at the hospital,

18:04.284 --> 18:06.250
so I have my answer.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.186
How 'bout I text her?

18:08.254 --> 18:09.887
Perhaps,
but what would you say?

"just listened

18:19.666 --> 18:21.399
I mean, he could've
at least texted me.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.000
Maybe he thought
it was too impersonal?

18:23.036 --> 18:26.437
I did say that I wanted
to give us a chance,

18:26.473 --> 18:29.674
and he just asked me on a date--

18:29.742 --> 18:31.275
maybe he just wanted a date?

18:31.311 --> 18:32.777
Maybe.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.113
Maybe I sounded too serious.
Maybe I scared him off.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.547
[snickers]

18:36.583 --> 18:38.449
I don't know evan that well,

18:38.518 --> 18:41.552
Doesn't seem like
the "scaring off" type.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.323
I think I'm gonna
wait a few days,

18:45.358 --> 18:47.125
till I know that everything's
okay with connor,

18:47.160 --> 18:48.292
then I'll speak to her
in person.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.560
No texting.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.129
I think
that would be wise, sir.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.698
The beginning of a relationship

19:37.677 --> 19:39.544
He said he was very sorry

19:39.612 --> 19:41.078
for accusing me
of violating my parole.

19:41.114 --> 19:41.913
Really?

19:41.948 --> 19:43.648
-No.
-Oh.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.982
No, he didn't.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.784
No. He's gonna be harder on me
than ever.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.619
Yeah, that's the way it works.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.955
Who does this guy
think he is?

19:51.024 --> 19:52.056
Oh, he's my personal javert.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.691
Yeah, I guess so!

19:55.595 --> 19:57.995
Very impressive<i> les mis</i>

19:58.031 --> 19:59.363
Oh.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.665
You know, in prison,

20:00.700 --> 20:01.866
there wasn't much to do

20:01.935 --> 20:05.736
other than read
and, um, stare at the walls.

20:05.772 --> 20:09.307
Yeah, I went through everybody
in the prison library,

20:09.375 --> 20:11.242
from austen to dickens
to elliot

20:11.277 --> 20:14.011
to hugo to mary shelley.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.880
And then you stopped
at mary shelley? Why?

20:15.915 --> 20:17.815
-I got paroled.
-Oh!

20:17.850 --> 20:19.050
[bree] got it.

20:19.085 --> 20:22.053
Yeah, but I am
reading through vonnegut now--

20:22.121 --> 20:23.621
that is good stuff.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.156
Wow.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.424
Oh, I was gonna show you some of
what I've been working on,

20:26.459 --> 20:27.525
but now I'm just scared.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.993
Don't be.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.895
I like everything.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.930
Hmm. Even hemingway?

20:32.966 --> 20:35.233
[luke] even hemingway.

-Yup.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.279
That was my sister.

20:48.314 --> 20:50.815
Oh, don't apologize.
How is she?

20:50.850 --> 20:52.850
How do you think?

20:52.919 --> 20:55.419
The press is having
a field day.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.821
Everybody loves it

20:56.889 --> 20:58.556
when the rich get
what they have coming to them.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.458
Don't say that.

21:00.526 --> 21:03.327
She's even more upset with dad
than I am.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.697
She's afraid he's gonna
take us down with him.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.065
So am I.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.467
David.

21:12.005 --> 21:15.306
You are not alone in this.
Remember that.

21:15.341 --> 21:16.807

21:45.738 --> 21:47.538
Uh... Always.

21:47.573 --> 21:48.939
What's up?

21:48.975 --> 21:51.509
I want to talk about
the pre-opening hotel expenses.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.743
'kay.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.645
Not really.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.347
I want to talk about
that voicemail you left me.

21:56.382 --> 21:57.982
Oh! Uh... Yeah.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.150
There's no need.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.618
Just don't--
don't worry about that.

22:00.653 --> 22:03.154
So you don't want
to give us a chance?

22:04.257 --> 22:05.790
That was a bad choice of words.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.326
I just meant,
"I accept your offer of a date."

22:08.394 --> 22:09.260
just-- just a date.

22:09.295 --> 22:11.062
Okay.

22:13.266 --> 22:15.032
I didn't get your voicemail
until last night,

22:15.068 --> 22:17.234
<i> after</i> the hospital,

22:17.270 --> 22:20.004
so the fact that I didn't
say anything about it then...

22:20.039 --> 22:22.440
Was just a misunderstanding?

22:22.475 --> 22:24.008
Yeah.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.443
We've had a lot of those.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.577
Charming, isn't it?

22:26.612 --> 22:28.579
You know, in movies,
it's charming.

22:28.614 --> 22:29.814
In real life,
it's just annoying.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.949
Well, yeah, we can
agree to disagree on that.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.252
But...

22:35.288 --> 22:37.088
You do
want to go on a date?

22:39.392 --> 22:40.691
Yes, I do.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.628
I am so glad.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.497
[chuckles]

22:46.532 --> 22:47.965
now, I propose
we make it two dates.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.133
[laughs] you do?

22:49.168 --> 22:50.134
Mm-hmm.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.669
Yeah, you see,
on the first date,

22:51.738 --> 22:52.770
we're bound to be
a little nervous,

22:52.805 --> 22:54.071
trying to put
our best foot forward,

22:54.107 --> 22:56.040
but on the second date,
we'll be more ourselves.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.376
Are you negotiating
our date?

22:58.411 --> 22:59.777
I am.

23:01.114 --> 23:03.748
All right.
Two dates it is.

23:03.783 --> 23:06.884
But I--
I can't do it right now.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.352
Oh, of course not.

23:08.388 --> 23:09.954
No, you have to see
if connor's okay.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.923
A first date
at a time t.B.D..

23:12.959 --> 23:15.659
I would like to arrange
the details of the first date.

23:15.695 --> 23:16.827
Do you agree?

23:16.896 --> 23:18.896
If I can arrange
the details of the second.

23:19.899 --> 23:20.865
It's a deal.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.336
Deal.

to see him like this.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.326
Yeah, I can imagine.

-Bree?
-Mm-hmm?

I'm not your usual type.

24:10.583 --> 24:11.982
Ah, well, you know what?

24:12.018 --> 24:14.251
Turns out my usual type
never really agreed with me, so.

24:15.388 --> 24:17.254
did you have a type?

24:21.294 --> 24:23.561
Yeah, I just had trouble
finding her.

-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

you should ask bree.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.488
Or luke.
