01:29.860 --> 01:34.072
Through the snow
and sleet and hail...

01:34.086 --> 01:37.423
through the blizzard,
through the gale...

01:37.506 --> 01:40.676
through the wind
and through the rain...

01:40.759 --> 01:43.678
over mountain, over plain...

01:43.761 --> 01:47.098
through the blinding
lightning flash...

01:47.182 --> 01:50.685
and the mighty thunder crash...

01:50.768 --> 01:54.939
ever faithful, ever true...

01:55.023 --> 01:57.317
nothing stops him.

01:57.442 --> 01:59.527
He'll get through.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.495
<i>Look out for Mr Stork
that persevering chap</i>

02:08.578 --> 02:12.080
<i>He'll come along and drop
a bundle in your lap</i>

02:12.206 --> 02:15.542
<i>You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which</i>

02:15.626 --> 02:19.171
<i>Millionaires, they get theirs
like the butcher and the baker</i>

02:19.254 --> 02:22.800
<i>So look out for Mr Stork
and let me tell you, friend</i>

02:22.883 --> 02:26.970
<i>Don't try to get away
He'll find you in the end</i>

02:27.054 --> 02:30.224
<i>He'll spot you out in China
or he'll fly to County Cork</i>

02:30.307 --> 02:33.685
<i>So you'd better look out
for Mr Stork</i>

03:22.107 --> 03:25.777
<i>Look out for Mr Stork
He's got you on his list</i>

03:25.861 --> 03:29.531
<i>And when he comes around
it's useless to resist</i>

03:29.614 --> 03:33.200
<i>Remember those quintuplets
and the woman in the shoe</i>

03:33.284 --> 03:36.704
<i>Maybe he's got his eye on you</i>

05:23.390 --> 05:25.684
All aboard! All aboard!

05:25.767 --> 05:29.604
All aboard! Let's go!

little whistle sounds</i>

06:08.934 --> 06:12.187
<i>Everybody hurries
to the circus grounds</i>

06:12.270 --> 06:14.898

<i>On the treetop</i>

07:00.567 --> 07:03.028
Where are we here?
Oh, here.

Well, little fella,
let's get goin'.

07:41.481 --> 07:45.736
Mrs Jumbo. Oh, Mrs Jumbo.

07:45.819 --> 07:47.779
Calling Mrs Jumbo.

07:49.865 --> 07:51.825
Mrs Jumbo?

07:53.535 --> 07:55.495
Oh. My.

07:57.748 --> 08:00.375
Mrs Jumbo!

08:04.421 --> 08:07.841

08:11.386 --> 08:15.057
- This is the place.
- Whew! At last.

08:15.182 --> 08:18.477
Which one of you ladies
is expecting?

08:18.560 --> 08:21.480
- Hmph! Not me.
- The very idea.

08:21.563 --> 08:24.358
Certainly not.
Over there, of course.

08:24.441 --> 08:26.652
Yes, of course.
Right over there.

08:26.777 --> 08:30.155
Oh. Of course.

08:37.788 --> 08:39.831
Here is a baby with eyes of blue...

08:39.914 --> 08:42.292

- Isn't it thrilling?
- I'm all a-flutter.

09:53.530 --> 09:57.200
Ah, this is a proud, proud day.

09:57.326 --> 10:00.454
- Well, hurry and open it, dearie.

10:02.873 --> 10:06.335

Look at him!

10:15.719 --> 10:18.638
Oh, he is a darling little baby.

10:18.722 --> 10:22.392
Adorable. Simply adorable.

10:22.517 --> 10:25.604
Did you ever see
anything so cunning?

10:25.687 --> 10:27.814
Isn't he a darling!

10:27.898 --> 10:32.110
Kootchy, kootchy, kootchy,
kootchy, kootchy, kootchy.

10:41.370 --> 10:43.622
- Oh!
- Oh!

10:43.705 --> 10:46.833
- Is it possible?
- Isn't there some mistake?

10:46.917 --> 10:49.711
Just look at those, those...

10:49.795 --> 10:52.589
E-A-R-S.

10:52.673 --> 10:56.343
Those what? Oh, ears!

10:56.426 --> 11:00.180
These! Aren't they funny? Oh!

11:00.263 --> 11:02.641
- Oh, my goodness.
- What a temper.

11:02.766 --> 11:04.518
Oh, what did I do?
Well, tell me.

11:04.601 --> 11:06.770
- Did I say anything?
- Perfectly harmless remark.

11:06.853 --> 11:08.480
I just said that they're funny,
and they are funny.

11:08.563 --> 11:10.774
- They certainly are.
- After all, who cares...

11:10.857 --> 11:13.151
about her precious little Jumbo?

11:13.276 --> 11:16.780
Jumbo? You mean Dumbo.

11:16.905 --> 11:19.032
Dumbo.

11:20.909 --> 11:23.453
- Dumbo, I say.
- That's good.

11:23.578 --> 11:26.707
- Dumbo! That's good.
- Dumbo.

12:11.668 --> 12:15.255
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

12:15.339 --> 12:20.302
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can.

12:20.385 --> 12:24.473
I thought I could. I thought I could.
I thought I could. I thought I could.

13:43.260 --> 13:45.178
<i>We slave until we're almost dead</i>

13:45.262 --> 13:48.557
<i>We're happy-hearted roustabouts</i>

13:49.891 --> 13:53.937
<i>Hike, ugh, hike, ugh
hike, ugh, hike</i>

13:54.021 --> 13:56.148
<i>We don't know when
we get our pay</i>

13:56.273 --> 13:58.984
<i>And when we do
we throw our pay away</i>

13:59.067 --> 14:02.654
<i>When we get our pay
we throw our money all away</i>

14:02.779 --> 14:04.865
<i>We get our pay when children say</i>

14:04.948 --> 14:07.617
<i>With happy hearts
It's circus day today</i>

14:07.701 --> 14:11.455
<i>Then we get our pay
just watching kids on circus day</i>

14:11.580 --> 14:15.667
<i>Muscles aching
Back near breaking</i>

14:15.751 --> 14:19.338

Jostling and juggling.
Fifteen minutes!

18:34.217 --> 18:36.345
Step right up and get your tickets.
Hurry, hurry now.

18:36.428 --> 18:39.556
Hurry to the big sideshow.
That's why you go under the big top.

18:39.639 --> 18:43.393
Fifteen big attractions that you
can't see anywhere else in the world!

18:43.518 --> 18:45.896
The greatest collection
in the entire world.

18:46.021 --> 18:50.609
And the greatest comedies are featured
and assembled for your entertainment.

18:50.692 --> 18:54.613
Ain't that the funniest thing
you ever saw? Look at his ears.

18:57.991 --> 19:00.619
Hey, guys, lookit!
Smitty's an elephant!

19:04.039 --> 19:05.874
- Aw, let me see!
- Boo!

19:05.957 --> 19:08.669
- You can't hide him from us.
- Yeah, his ears are still stickin' out.

19:08.752 --> 19:10.337
- Come on!
- We wanna see him!

19:10.420 --> 19:13.340
- We wanna laugh.
- Sure, that's what we came for.

19:18.095 --> 19:21.348
Hey, the biggest slingshot
in the world.

19:21.431 --> 19:23.558
- Hey! Cut that out!
- Hey, let's get out of here.

19:23.684 --> 19:27.521
- You're hurting me! Help!
- Here, you! What's going on?

19:29.648 --> 19:31.775
Down. Mrs Jumbo, down!

19:31.858 --> 19:34.695
Surround her. Tie her down.

19:53.714 --> 19:56.049
Get down!

19:56.133 --> 19:59.052
Calm down! Tie her down!

20:33.211 --> 20:35.339
Darling, it was so funny.

20:35.422 --> 20:37.632
Oh, my dear, can you bear it?

20:37.758 --> 20:41.511
When she doused the ringmaster,
I just thought I'd die.

20:41.636 --> 20:44.431
Well, personally, I think
she went a bit too far.

20:44.514 --> 20:46.892
After all, one mustn't forget
one is a lady.

20:47.017 --> 20:48.685
- Oh, you're right, dear. Yes.
- Oh, that's very true.

20:48.769 --> 20:51.146
Oh, well, I suppose
that's mother love.

20:51.229 --> 20:53.607
But it's certainly no excuse
for what she did.

20:53.690 --> 20:56.693
Mother love might cover
a multitude of sins.

20:56.777 --> 20:59.154
It's true, my dear,
and she has such a streak in...

20:59.279 --> 21:01.281
A guy can't eat in peace.

21:01.365 --> 21:03.325
Yes, but mother love does...

21:03.408 --> 21:05.619
Gab, gab, gab.
Always gossipin'.

21:05.702 --> 21:09.122
Girls, girls! Listen!

21:09.206 --> 21:11.583
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.

21:11.708 --> 21:14.586
- Well, darling, tell us all.
- Go on, go on.

21:14.670 --> 21:19.299
Well, I heard today that they have
put her in solitary confinement.

21:19.383 --> 21:21.385
- No!
- You don't mean it!

21:21.468 --> 21:23.929
Oh, how awful for her!

21:24.054 --> 21:26.848
Well, I-I must say,
I-I don't blame her for anything.

21:26.932 --> 21:30.686
You're absolutely right.
It's all the fault of that little...

21:30.811 --> 21:33.855
F-R-E-A-K.

21:33.939 --> 21:38.402
Yes, him with those ears
that only a mother could love.

21:39.736 --> 21:41.655
What's the matter with his ears?

21:41.738 --> 21:44.825
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.
I think they're cute.

21:46.076 --> 21:49.538
Ladies, ladies!
It's no laughing matter at all.

21:49.621 --> 21:51.873
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.

21:51.957 --> 21:56.503
Don't forget that we elephants
have always walked with dignity.

21:56.586 --> 21:58.964
His disgrace is our own shame.

21:59.047 --> 22:01.008
- Yes, that's true. That's very true.
- Oh, indeed it is.

22:01.091 --> 22:05.804
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat
at the same bale of hay with him.

22:05.887 --> 22:07.222
- No. Right.
- Me either, dearie.

22:07.305 --> 22:10.017
- I should say.
- Nor I. That's just how I feel about it.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.477
Here he comes now.

22:12.602 --> 22:16.273
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.

22:16.398 --> 22:18.942
Shh.

22:22.112 --> 22:25.782
How do ya like that?
Givin' him the cold shoulder.

22:27.284 --> 22:30.203
Poor little guy.

22:30.287 --> 22:34.624
There he goes,
without a friend in the world.

22:36.501 --> 22:38.503
Nobody to turn to.

22:40.339 --> 22:43.717
Oh, I'll do somethin' about this.

22:48.805 --> 22:50.724
A mouse!

22:55.896 --> 22:57.898
So ya like to pick
on little guys, huh?

22:57.981 --> 23:00.651
Well, why don't you pick on me?

23:07.240 --> 23:09.451
A proud race.

23:09.576 --> 23:11.787
Overstuffed hay bags!

23:23.048 --> 23:25.509
Boo!

23:25.634 --> 23:28.261
Still afraid of a mouse.

23:28.345 --> 23:31.556
Ho-ho, boy.
Wait'll I tell the little guy.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.393
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.

23:34.476 --> 23:37.145
You can come out now.

23:37.229 --> 23:40.649
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.

23:40.732 --> 23:42.943
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.

23:43.026 --> 23:44.987
Come on out, won't ya?

23:46.863 --> 23:50.117
You're not really afraid
of little me, are ya?

23:51.743 --> 23:54.121
Ya are?
Must've overdid it in there.

23:54.204 --> 23:56.915
Don't know my own strength sometimes.

23:59.251 --> 24:01.962
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.

24:06.008 --> 24:09.094
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Ya gotta come out first.

24:15.225 --> 24:17.519
Too bad ya don't trust me,
'cause I thought...

24:17.602 --> 24:22.441
uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we
might get your mother out of the clink.

24:22.524 --> 24:25.444
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't
be interested. So long, Dumbo.

24:31.616 --> 24:34.161
Well, that's more like it.

24:34.244 --> 24:36.788
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.

24:36.913 --> 24:39.291
She's just broken-hearted.

24:39.374 --> 24:43.211
It ain't nobody's fault
you got them big ears.

24:43.295 --> 24:46.590
Uh-oh. Boy, I stepped in it that time.

24:46.673 --> 24:51.636
Aw, gee, Dumbo.
I think your ears are beautiful.

24:51.720 --> 24:55.641
Sure. As a matter of fact,
I think they're very decorative.

24:55.766 --> 24:59.686
You know, lots of people
with big ears are famous.

24:59.770 --> 25:03.023
Ho-ho, boy.
All we gotta do is build an act.

25:03.106 --> 25:06.193
Make ya a star. A headliner!

25:06.276 --> 25:08.487
Dumbo the Great!

25:11.615 --> 25:14.368
Uh-oh. The great what?

25:16.203 --> 25:20.374
Ya know, Dumbo,
we gotta get an idea.

25:20.457 --> 25:24.378
Not just any idea.
Something colossal, like, uh...

25:24.461 --> 25:28.215
Have I got an idea!
What an idea!

25:28.298 --> 25:30.509
Huh. He never had an idea
in his life.

25:30.634 --> 25:34.930
Just visualize:
One elephant climbs up...

25:35.013 --> 25:38.266
on top of another elephant
until finally...

25:38.350 --> 25:40.602
all 17 elephants...

25:40.686 --> 25:44.106
have constructed
an enormous pyramid...

25:44.189 --> 25:46.274
of pachyderms.

25:46.358 --> 25:48.819
I step out.

25:48.944 --> 25:50.862
I blow the whistle.

25:50.946 --> 25:53.407
- Yeah.
- The trumpets are trumpeting.

25:53.490 --> 25:55.325
- Yeah.
- And now...

25:55.409 --> 25:57.703
comes the climax!

25:59.246 --> 26:01.707
Yeah? What is the climax?

26:01.790 --> 26:04.251
Hmm. I don't know.

26:04.334 --> 26:06.628
I knew he never had nothin'.

26:06.753 --> 26:09.673
Well, maybe it comes to me...

26:09.756 --> 26:13.427
in a vision while I dream.

26:13.510 --> 26:15.887
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Boss.

26:16.013 --> 26:17.931
Climax.

26:19.349 --> 26:23.103
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.

26:24.646 --> 26:27.566
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.

27:23.914 --> 27:28.168
I am the voice
of your subconscious mind.

27:29.252 --> 27:31.797
Your inspiration.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.424
Now, concentrate.

27:37.469 --> 27:39.179
Remember?
Your pyramid of elephants...

27:39.262 --> 27:41.390
are standing in the ring
waitin' for a climax.

27:41.473 --> 27:45.310
- Climax.
- You are now getting that climax.

27:45.435 --> 27:47.396
- Climax.
- How's the reception?

27:47.479 --> 27:50.691
Comin' through okay? Good.

27:50.774 --> 27:53.235
Suddenly, from the sidelines,
comes your climax.

27:53.318 --> 27:55.696
- Climax.
- Gallopin' across the arena.

27:55.779 --> 27:58.156
- Arena.
- He jumps from a springboard...

27:58.281 --> 27:59.741
to a platform.

27:59.825 --> 28:03.078
At the very pinnacle of your pyramid,
he waves a flag...

28:03.161 --> 28:04.871
for a glorious finish!

28:04.955 --> 28:08.959
- Finish?
- And who is your climax?

28:10.127 --> 28:11.962
The little elephant
with the big ears!

28:12.045 --> 28:17.467
The world's mightiest
midget mastodon! Dumbo!

28:17.551 --> 28:19.469
What?

28:19.553 --> 28:22.014
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

28:22.139 --> 28:24.349
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

28:24.474 --> 28:27.728
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

28:27.811 --> 28:29.813
I got it! I got it!

28:31.148 --> 28:34.151
Ladies and gentlemen...

28:34.234 --> 28:37.654
we will now present
for your entertainment...

28:37.738 --> 28:41.074
the most stupendous, magnificent...

28:41.158 --> 28:44.494
super-colossal spectacle.

28:44.578 --> 28:46.872
On this tiny...

28:46.997 --> 28:50.042
little, insignificant ball...

28:50.125 --> 28:52.336
we will construct for you...

28:52.419 --> 28:56.340
a pyramid, not of wood,
not of stone...

28:56.423 --> 28:59.426
To hear him talk,
you'd think he was going to do it.

28:59.509 --> 29:02.346
- But a living, breathing...
- The stuffed shirt.

29:02.429 --> 29:06.433
Pyramid of ponderous, pulsating...

29:06.516 --> 29:10.937
pulchritudinous pachyderms!

29:12.230 --> 29:14.316
I give you the elephants.

29:39.758 --> 29:41.677
Aren't we a bit clumsy?

29:50.227 --> 29:53.021
Gaining a little weight,
aren't you, honey?

29:53.105 --> 29:56.483
You're no cream puff
yourself, dearie.

29:56.566 --> 29:59.611
Quiet up there.
Tend to your work, girls.

30:13.417 --> 30:17.337
Take your foot out of my eye,
clumsy ox.

30:23.343 --> 30:25.387
Steady, girls.

30:33.687 --> 30:36.148
Boy, that was a close one.

30:36.273 --> 30:39.776
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.

30:39.860 --> 30:42.779
Okay, okay.
Don't wave it no more. I saw ya.

30:42.863 --> 30:45.532
Now, look. All ya gotta do
is run out, see?

30:45.615 --> 30:47.617
Jump on the springboard.

30:47.701 --> 30:51.538
All right, now show me
just how you're gonna do it.

30:51.621 --> 30:54.708
That's it. Attaboy.
That's the stuff. Come on.

30:54.791 --> 30:57.169
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! Dumbo!

30:57.294 --> 30:59.838
Oh, those ears.
We gotta do somethin', quick.

31:03.133 --> 31:05.344
Ladies and gentlemen...

31:05.427 --> 31:08.388
you have now seen the impossible...

31:08.472 --> 31:10.849
accomplished in front of your faces.

31:10.974 --> 31:13.602
Seven jungle giants...

31:13.685 --> 31:15.604
each one weighing not...

31:15.687 --> 31:17.272
That windbag!

31:17.356 --> 31:20.233
- Why doesn't he come to the point?
- 7,500 pounds!

31:20.317 --> 31:22.527
And now, I present...

31:22.653 --> 31:25.906
the world's smallest
little elephant...

31:25.989 --> 31:29.910
who will spring
from this springboard...

31:30.035 --> 31:32.120
in one spring...

31:32.204 --> 31:36.208
to the top of this pyramid,
waving his little flag...

31:36.291 --> 31:39.586
for a grand climax!

31:39.670 --> 31:42.130
Ladies and gentlemen...

31:42.214 --> 31:45.509
I give you Dumbo!

31:56.353 --> 31:58.647
Go on! Get goin'!

31:58.730 --> 32:01.984
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo! That's your cue!

32:02.067 --> 32:04.111
You're on, Dumbo.

33:04.671 --> 33:07.341
Out of my way, assassin!

34:11.487 --> 34:13.614
- Dear!
- Ohh.

34:13.739 --> 34:17.953
I never thought I'd live
to see the big top fall.

34:18.036 --> 34:22.666
Because of that Dumbo,
I never can show my face there again.

34:22.748 --> 34:26.128
Oh, look at my beautiful tail!

34:26.210 --> 34:29.715
I'd just like to spank
the daylights out of him...

34:29.840 --> 34:33.760
Ah! Oh! Oh! Ohh.

34:33.844 --> 34:38.056
Oh, that won't be necessary, dearie.

34:38.139 --> 34:40.600
They fixed him good.

34:40.684 --> 34:42.601
- What do you mean?
- Wh-What did they do?

34:42.686 --> 34:44.396
- Did they beat him?
- What is it, darling?

34:44.478 --> 34:47.024
- Tell us.
- Come, come. I demand to know.

34:47.107 --> 34:51.277
Oh. Well, they've gone and made him...

34:51.360 --> 34:54.239
- Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
- Out with it!

34:54.322 --> 34:57.117
Made him a clown.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.119
A clown?

34:59.202 --> 35:02.039
- No!
- Yes.

35:02.122 --> 35:05.792
Oh, the shame of it.

35:05.876 --> 35:08.337
Let us take the solemn vow.

35:10.547 --> 35:14.217
From now on, he is no longer...

35:14.301 --> 35:16.219
an elephant.

35:24.895 --> 35:29.483
Please! Help me save
my poor baby!

35:29.566 --> 35:33.320
Whoo! Save my child!

35:43.664 --> 35:45.666
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where are you? Yoo-hoo!

35:45.749 --> 35:48.377
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

35:48.460 --> 35:50.671
Hey! Hey! Hey!

36:17.656 --> 36:19.700

36:34.006 --> 36:36.299

36:36.425 --> 36:38.385
- Hurry up!
- We'll save you. Go on.

36:38.468 --> 36:40.846
- Jump!
- We'll save ya.

36:57.487 --> 36:59.781
Whew! Boy, oh, boy,

36:59.865 --> 37:01.783
- What a performance!
- Are we good?

37:01.867 --> 37:03.618
Thirteen curtain calls.
Thirteen!

37:03.702 --> 37:05.662
Yeah, sure brought down
the house, all right.

37:05.746 --> 37:08.874
Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em.
Ask me, Joey. Go ahead. Ask me.

37:08.957 --> 37:10.917
You said it.
We rolled 'em in the aisles.

37:11.001 --> 37:13.211
- Boy, oh, boy, what a act.
- Oh, "what a act" is right.

37:13.337 --> 37:14.963
Stupendous, I calls it.

37:15.047 --> 37:16.923
They'll have more respect
for us clowns now.

37:17.007 --> 37:19.092
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- Here, boys.

37:19.176 --> 37:21.720
This calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.

37:21.845 --> 37:25.015
- Poison! Am I thirsty.
- I could use one of them myself.

37:25.098 --> 37:27.017
- This one's on Dumbo.
- Yeah, Dumbo.

37:27.100 --> 37:30.437
- Dumbo!
- Here's plaster in his eyes.

37:30.520 --> 37:33.190
See? They're drinkin'
a toast to ya.

37:33.273 --> 37:35.400
Yeah. You're a big hit.

37:39.863 --> 37:41.990
Why, uh, you're terrific.

37:44.201 --> 37:46.745
Oh, you're colossal. Stupendous.

37:48.121 --> 37:51.958
Come on. Alley-oop.
I gotta wash behind your ears.

37:52.042 --> 37:54.127
You oughta be proud.

37:54.211 --> 37:56.338
You're a success.

Look. A peanut!

38:03.887 --> 38:06.765
Come on. Eat it.

Oh-ho-ho.

Why, we're goin' over

38:19.152 --> 38:21.363
I made an appointment for ya.
Didn't I tell ya? Huh!

38:21.446 --> 38:24.574
Just like me. I must have forgot.
Come on. Get your hat.

38:30.831 --> 38:34.418
Oh. Right over there.

38:34.543 --> 38:36.670
Cosy little place, ain't it?

38:44.094 --> 38:47.931
Mrs Jumbo. I hope she's in.

38:49.016 --> 38:51.935
Someone to see ya.

39:21.006 --> 39:24.051
<i>Baby mine</i>

41:35.682 --> 41:38.685
Boy, I can't get over the way
we rolled 'em in the aisles.

41:38.769 --> 41:41.855
- Just wait'll we hit the big town.
- This gives me an idea.

41:41.938 --> 41:44.316
Let's raise the platform
the elephant jumps off of.

41:44.441 --> 41:46.985
Yeah! If they laugh
when he jumps 20 feet...

41:47.110 --> 41:49.946
they'll laugh twice as hard
if he jumps 40 feet.

41:50.030 --> 41:53.033
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Simple mathematics.

41:53.116 --> 41:56.703
- Let's make it 80 feet.
- Don't be a piker. 180.

41:56.787 --> 41:58.747
- Make it 300.
- A thousand.

41:58.830 --> 42:01.583
- Yeah, that's good.
- Hey, be careful.

42:01.667 --> 42:03.627
- You'll hurt the little guy.
- Aw, go on.

42:03.710 --> 42:06.588
- Elephants ain't got no feelings.
- No, they're made of rubber.

42:06.672 --> 42:09.466
This idea is sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.

42:09.549 --> 42:10.968
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

42:11.051 --> 42:12.886
Hey, hey!
Let's hit him for a raise.

42:12.970 --> 42:15.180
Yeah, sure.
This is worth real dough.

42:15.305 --> 42:18.934
<i>Oh, we're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise</i>

42:19.017 --> 42:22.604
<i>Yes, we're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise</i>

42:22.688 --> 42:26.525
<i>Oh, we're gonna get more money
'cause we know that we're funny</i>

42:26.650 --> 42:29.903
<i>We're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise</i>

42:35.325 --> 42:39.079
I know how ya feel, Dumbo,
but you gotta pull yourself together.

42:39.162 --> 42:43.166
What would your mother think of ya,
if she saw you crying like this?

42:43.250 --> 42:46.003
Remember, you come of a proud race.

42:47.504 --> 42:49.798
Why you're a-a-a... a pachyderm...

42:49.881 --> 42:51.800
and pachyderms don't cry.

42:51.883 --> 42:54.970
What's cryin' get ya anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.

42:57.180 --> 42:59.099
There. Ya see?

43:03.228 --> 43:07.441
Well, ain't nothin'

43:07.524 --> 43:10.444
Oops-a-daisy. We'll have ya

43:11.528 --> 43:13.447
Come on.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.287

43:22.372 --> 43:24.291
Listen, little fella.

43:24.374 --> 43:27.127

big things together.

43:30.547 --> 43:34.468
Hold your breath. Why, your mother's
gonna be so proud of ya.

43:34.551 --> 43:36.136
I'm gonna be proud of ya too.

43:36.219 --> 43:39.389
The whole circus is gonna be proud
of ya. Now, what do ya think of that?

43:39.473 --> 43:41.475
Swallow it.

43:41.558 --> 43:44.019
Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.

43:46.396 --> 43:48.690
Oh, I guess you had
one little one left over.

43:48.815 --> 43:52.235
Dumbo, we'll bounce back so ha...

43:52.319 --> 43:55.238
Hey, what's the matter with you?

44:01.161 --> 44:04.081
What kind of water is this, anyhow?

44:57.217 --> 45:00.137
Balloonies.

45:00.220 --> 45:02.222
Hiya, George.

45:22.492 --> 45:25.245
Whee!

45:32.210 --> 45:36.048
That's a pretty
schstrick schlick.

45:36.131 --> 45:41.261
All right. Let's see ya
blow a square one, pal.

45:48.310 --> 45:51.605
Say, that's very, very clever.

45:51.688 --> 45:56.276
Now blow a great big one.

46:18.298 --> 46:20.300
That's a pretty sh... Hey!

46:24.721 --> 46:27.182
Dumbo.

46:27.265 --> 46:29.726
You see what I see?

47:37.210 --> 47:41.256
<i>Look out, look out
Pink elephants on parade</i>

47:41.340 --> 47:43.717
<i>Here they come
Hippity-hoppity</i>

47:43.842 --> 47:47.971
<i>They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere</i>

47:48.055 --> 47:50.265
<i>Look out, look out</i>

47:50.349 --> 47:53.226
<i>They're walking around the bed
on their head</i>

47:53.310 --> 47:56.229
<i>Clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid</i>

47:56.313 --> 47:58.690
<i>Pink elephants on parade</i>

47:58.774 --> 48:00.776
<i>- What'll I do
- What'll I do</i>

48:00.859 --> 48:03.111
<i>What an unusual view</i>

48:03.195 --> 48:07.032
<i>I can stand the sight of worms
and look at microscopic germs</i>

48:07.157 --> 48:11.662
<i>But Technicolour pachyderms
is really too much for me</i>

48:11.745 --> 48:13.664
<i>I am not the type to faint</i>

48:13.747 --> 48:15.749
<i>When things are odd
or things are quaint</i>

48:15.832 --> 48:17.918
<i>But seein'things
you know there ain't</i>

48:18.001 --> 48:20.462
<i>Can certainly give you
an awful fright</i>

48:20.587 --> 48:23.590
<i>What a sight
Chase 'em away, chase 'em away</i>

48:23.674 --> 48:27.427
<i>I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade</i>

48:27.511 --> 48:29.888
<i>- Hey, hey, hey
- Pink elephants</i>

48:31.056 --> 48:33.183
<i>Pink elephants</i>

48:33.266 --> 48:35.185
<i>Pink elephants</i>

51:01.289 --> 51:04.668
- Well, looky here, looky here.
- My, my.

51:04.751 --> 51:06.670
Why, this is most irregular.

51:06.753 --> 51:09.298
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.

51:09.423 --> 51:14.303
- They ain't dead, is they?
- No. Dead people don't snore.

51:14.386 --> 51:16.722
Or do they?

51:18.307 --> 51:20.309
Uh, wh-what's all the ruckus?
Come on.

51:20.392 --> 51:24.521
Step aside, brother.
Uh, what's cookin' 'round here?

51:24.604 --> 51:26.690
What's the good news?
What's fryin', boy?

51:26.773 --> 51:30.694
- Just look down there, brother.
- And prepare yourself for a shock.

51:37.200 --> 51:40.495
- Well, hush my beak!
- Go ahead. Wake 'em up, brother.

51:40.579 --> 51:42.706
Yeah. Find out
what they're doin' up here.

51:42.789 --> 51:44.916
- Yeah.
- And "ax" them what they want.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.336
Okay, boys. Leave it to me.

52:11.526 --> 52:15.614
Ohh! Those pink elephants.

52:15.697 --> 52:18.575
Ho! Pink elephants? Mm-mmm!

52:22.454 --> 52:26.291
What's so funny? What are you boys
doin' down here, anyway?

52:26.375 --> 52:28.502
What are we doin' down here?

52:28.585 --> 52:30.504
Well, hear him talk.

52:30.587 --> 52:33.590
Go on.
Fly up a tree where you belong.

52:35.509 --> 52:37.970
- Say, look here, Brother Rat.
- Brother Rat?

52:38.095 --> 52:41.390
Now listen. I ain't your brother
and I ain't no rat, see?

52:41.473 --> 52:44.184
Uh-huh. And I suppose you...

52:44.267 --> 52:48.021
and no elephant ain't
up in no tree, either.

52:48.146 --> 52:51.650
No! No, me and no tree
ain't up no... Huh?

52:51.775 --> 52:53.860
Tree?

52:56.488 --> 52:58.573
Yo!

52:59.825 --> 53:02.285
Dumbo.

53:02.411 --> 53:04.955
Dumbo. Wake up.

53:05.080 --> 53:07.958
Wake up, Dumbo!

53:08.041 --> 53:11.628
Don't look now,
but I think we're up in a tree.

53:40.866 --> 53:43.535
Aw, don't pay no attention
to them scarecrows.

53:43.618 --> 53:46.747
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.

53:46.830 --> 53:48.874
So long, boy!

53:56.715 --> 54:00.135
But I wonder how we ever
got up in that tree, anyway.

54:02.304 --> 54:04.765
Now, let's see.

54:04.890 --> 54:07.434
Elephants can't climb trees,
can they?

54:07.517 --> 54:10.062
Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.

54:10.187 --> 54:13.273
Couldn't jump up.
Mm-mm. It's too high.

54:13.357 --> 54:15.901
Hey there, son.
Maybe you all flew up.

54:17.069 --> 54:20.906
Maybe we flew up.
Yeah, maybe we...

54:21.031 --> 54:24.117
That's it! Dumbo! You flew!

54:24.201 --> 54:26.745
Boy, am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?

54:26.870 --> 54:30.207
Your ears. Just look at 'em, Dumbo.
Why, they're perfect wings.

54:30.290 --> 54:34.962
The very things that held ya down
are gonna carry ya up and up and up!

54:35.045 --> 54:37.255
I can see it all now.

54:37.381 --> 54:39.925
Dumbo, the Ninth Wonder
of the Universe!

54:40.050 --> 54:42.260
The world's only flyin' elephant!

54:45.347 --> 54:47.307
Did you ever see an elephant fly?

54:47.391 --> 54:50.978
- Well, I've seen a horsefly.
- Ah, I've seen a dragonfly.

54:51.061 --> 54:53.188
- Hee-hee. I've seen a housefly.
- Yeah!

54:54.940 --> 54:57.067
See, I've seen all that too.

54:57.150 --> 55:00.779
I've seen a peanut stand
and heard a rubber band.

55:00.862 --> 55:03.824
I seen a needle
that winked its eye.

55:03.907 --> 55:07.285
<i>But I be done seen
about ever'thing</i>

55:07.369 --> 55:09.579
<i>When I see a elephant fly</i>

55:09.663 --> 55:13.417
<i>- What'd you say, boy?
- I said when I see a elephant fly</i>

55:13.542 --> 55:16.962
<i>I seen a front porch swing
heard a diamond ring</i>

55:17.087 --> 55:19.881
<i>I seen a polka-dot railroad tie</i>

55:19.965 --> 55:23.635
<i>But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing</i>

55:23.760 --> 55:25.887
<i>When I see a elephant fly</i>

55:26.013 --> 55:28.932
<i>- Da da-da-da
- Da-da-da do-do-dow wow</i>

55:29.016 --> 55:31.893
<i>- Da da-da-da
- Hey, wow</i>

55:31.977 --> 55:34.604
<i>I saw a clotheshorse
He rear up and buck</i>

55:34.688 --> 55:37.983
<i>And they tell me that a man
made a vegetable truck</i>

55:38.066 --> 55:41.028
<i>I didn't see that
I only heard</i>

55:41.111 --> 55:43.739
<i>Just to be sociable
I'll take your word</i>

55:43.822 --> 55:47.034
<i>- I heard a fireside chat
- I saw a baseball bat</i>

55:47.117 --> 55:50.037
<i>And I just laughed
till I thought I'd die</i>

55:50.120 --> 55:53.790
<i>But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing</i>

55:53.874 --> 55:56.960
<i>When I see a elephant fly</i>

55:57.044 --> 56:00.464
<i>Bo Sho Ba-da-do-do</i>

56:09.389 --> 56:12.893
<i>But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing</i>

56:12.976 --> 56:17.314
<i>When I see a elephant fly</i>

56:17.397 --> 56:20.525
With the wind.

56:20.609 --> 56:25.155
<i>When I see a elephant</i>

56:25.238 --> 56:27.783
<i>Fly</i>

56:35.457 --> 56:38.877
All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough.

56:43.382 --> 56:45.092
Quiet, gentlemen.

56:45.175 --> 56:47.844
The Reverend Rodent
is gonna address you.

56:47.928 --> 56:51.098
You oughta be ashamed
of yourselves.

56:51.181 --> 56:53.475
A bunch of big guys like you...

56:53.558 --> 56:56.853
pickin' on a poor
little orphan like him.

56:56.937 --> 57:01.191
Suppose you was torn away from
your mother when you was just a baby...

57:01.274 --> 57:03.652
nobody to tuck you in at nights...

57:03.777 --> 57:08.657
no warm, soft, caressin' trunk
to snuzzle into.

57:08.740 --> 57:11.076
How would you like to be
left out alone...

57:11.159 --> 57:14.538
in a cold, cruel, heartless world?

57:14.621 --> 57:17.874
And why? I ask ya, why?

57:17.958 --> 57:21.962
Just because he's got those big ears,
they call him a freak.

57:22.045 --> 57:24.172
The laughing stock of the circus.

57:24.256 --> 57:26.800
Then when his mother
tried to protect him...

57:26.925 --> 57:29.303
they threw her into the clink.

57:29.386 --> 57:33.140
And on top of that,
they made him a clown!

57:33.265 --> 57:36.184
Socially, he's washed up.

57:36.268 --> 57:40.480
Ah, but what's the use of talkin'
to you cold-hearted birds?

57:40.564 --> 57:42.691
Go ahead. Have your fun.

57:42.816 --> 57:45.861
Laugh at him.
Kick him, now that he's down.

57:45.944 --> 57:48.405
Go on!

57:48.488 --> 57:50.490
We don't care.

57:57.581 --> 57:59.499
Come on, Dumbo.

58:05.005 --> 58:07.215
Hey, brother,
w-w-wait a minute.

58:07.341 --> 58:09.885
Uh, don't go away
feelin' like that.

58:10.010 --> 58:12.220
We done seen the light.

58:12.304 --> 58:14.222
You boys is okay.

58:14.306 --> 58:16.516
Please, you've done enough.

58:16.600 --> 58:20.937
Well, but we's all fixin' to help you.
Uh, ain't that the truth, boys?

58:21.021 --> 58:23.231
- Well, it sure is.
- Uh, yeah, that... You're right.

58:23.357 --> 58:26.234
You wanna make the elephant fly,
don't ya?

58:26.318 --> 58:29.738
Well, you gotta use a lot of'chology.
You know, psychology.

58:29.863 --> 58:32.949
Now, here's what you do.
First, you, uh...

58:33.033 --> 58:34.951
Uh, bu...

58:35.035 --> 58:37.954
And then, right after that,
you, uh...

58:40.374 --> 58:43.210
Use the magic feather.
Catch on?

58:43.293 --> 58:45.837
The magic feather?

58:45.963 --> 58:47.923
Yeah, I gotcha.

58:48.006 --> 58:51.593
Dumbo! Look! Have I got it!

58:51.718 --> 58:54.638
The magic feather!
Now you can fly!

58:58.850 --> 59:02.354
Let's go. Let's go.

59:02.479 --> 59:05.941
- Heave ho. Heave ho.
- Let's go, Dumbo.

59:06.024 --> 59:09.277
- Let's go. Let's go.

59:09.361 --> 59:11.279
- Up, down. Up, down.

59:11.363 --> 59:13.573
- One, two, One, two. One, two.
- Heave ho.

59:13.657 --> 59:15.951
Faster, faster.
Get up flyin' speed.

59:16.034 --> 59:18.495
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage.

59:18.578 --> 59:20.497
Take off.

59:27.838 --> 59:29.756
Aw, it's no use, Dumbo.

59:29.840 --> 59:32.301
I guess it's just
another one of their... Look!

59:32.384 --> 59:35.095
Hot diggity! You're flyin'.

59:35.178 --> 59:37.139
You're flyin'!

59:39.683 --> 59:43.270
Uh, why, he flies
just like a eagle.

59:43.353 --> 59:45.647
That's better than a aeroplane.

59:45.772 --> 59:48.233
Brother, now I've seen everything.

59:50.360 --> 59:53.739
<i>But I be done seen

you're standing
on the threshold of success.

01:00:47.584 --> 01:00:50.045
Don't look down.
It'll make you dizzy.

01:00:50.128 --> 01:00:53.799
Boy, are they in for a surprise.
Ho-ho.

01:00:54.883 --> 01:00:59.012

Dumbo, come on. Fly.
Open them ears.

01:01:23.412 --> 01:01:26.331
The magic feather was just a gag.
You can fly.

Honest, you can.
