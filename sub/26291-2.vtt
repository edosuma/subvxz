WEBVTT

00:11.359 --> 00:13.970
Over here.
Come on, come on.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.450
Let's go.
Move it.

00:22.979 --> 00:23.936
What was that?

00:28.202 --> 00:30.160
This is
a restricted area!

00:30.204 --> 00:31.857
Identify yourself,

00:31.901 --> 00:34.034
or you will be detained!

00:41.911 --> 00:43.652
Get the crate.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.403
Welcome to the Big Easy,
Mr. Desmond.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.840
Hope you enjoy your stay.

01:01.017 --> 01:03.759
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:03.802 --> 01:06.327
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:06.370 --> 01:08.807
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:18.165 --> 01:19.775

01:22.386 --> 01:23.909
Good morning,
Christopher.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.520
Not for everyone, it ain't.

01:25.563 --> 01:27.391
COD of both vics

01:27.435 --> 01:30.351
is a single,
close-range GSW to the base

01:30.394 --> 01:32.570
of the skull,
and the placement's identical.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.355
Multiple shooters?Can't be sure,
but the victims

01:34.398 --> 01:36.748
died simultaneously
and without warning.

01:36.792 --> 01:39.621
They were ambushed.Most likely.
By people

01:39.664 --> 01:41.013
who were advanced in training.

01:41.057 --> 01:42.798
How do you know that?

01:42.841 --> 01:46.584
The entry wound angles
are precise, almost surgical.

01:46.628 --> 01:49.413
The bullets had a direct path
to the brain stem.

01:49.457 --> 01:50.719
Like flipping a light switch.

01:50.762 --> 01:53.591
Meet David Anderson
and Ted Loomis.

01:53.635 --> 01:56.072
Found their DIA credentials
in the van. But get this:

01:56.116 --> 01:58.335
they're both administrative
clerks out of DC.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.468
Since when do clerks carry MP5s?

02:00.511 --> 02:04.167
About as often as they conduct
covert field operations. Never.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.952
Hey, guys.
Come check this out.

02:06.996 --> 02:09.520
All right, so riddle me this:
what do you get when you cross

02:09.564 --> 02:11.653
a plain pine box with
a self-contained oxygen system

02:11.696 --> 02:13.698
and reinforced restraints?The perfect way

02:13.742 --> 02:16.092
to transport someone
without anybody knowing.Yeah.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.181
The jack in this box
was pretty banged up, too.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.183
I found significant blood
and skin cell traces.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.663
LASALLE:
This wasn't a hit.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.230
It was a rescue mission.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.319
Anderson and Loomis were
just collateral damage.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.625
Why is the Defense
Intelligence Agency

02:27.669 --> 02:29.714
running ops here
without letting us know?

02:29.758 --> 02:32.239
Don't know. But we got
at least one trained gunman

02:32.282 --> 02:34.719
out there on the loose,
and they're gonna tell us

02:34.763 --> 02:36.330
who was in this crate and why.

02:36.373 --> 02:37.722
Who gets to make that call?

02:37.766 --> 02:40.725
Till Pride comes back,
the privilege is all mine.

02:43.772 --> 02:44.903
PRIDE:
Good seeing you.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.731
We'll see you later
on today, all right?

02:46.775 --> 02:49.212
Thank you. Hey.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.605
Okay,

02:50.648 --> 02:51.867
Mr. Rogers.Wha...?

02:51.910 --> 02:53.303
Now that you've
literally said hello

02:53.347 --> 02:54.783
to every person
in your neighborhood,

02:54.826 --> 02:55.914
can we please
keep it moving?

02:55.958 --> 02:56.959
What's the rush?Glad to see you, Dwayne.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.656
Thank you.
The sun is out,

02:58.700 --> 03:00.702
there's not a
cloud in the sky;

03:00.745 --> 03:03.226
it's a perfect
day for a walk.A shortwalk

03:03.270 --> 03:05.228
is what we agreed to.People want
to chat.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.230
How you doing?
MAN:
Hey, Dwayne.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.971
It'd be rude
to ignore them.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.581
You are loving it, Dad.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.844
Ah, maybe a little.

03:12.888 --> 03:15.847
You know I wouldn't have
made it this far without you.

03:15.891 --> 03:18.589
And that is why you
are my favorite child.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.417
I'm your only child.

03:20.461 --> 03:21.984
Mm.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.725
And who are you fooling?

03:23.768 --> 03:26.510
With or without me, you
would've fought your way back.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.556
I'm not so sure
about that.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.690
Tell me something.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.519
How'd you get
to be so smart?

03:35.563 --> 03:37.260
Mm, Mom.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.827
Good

03:38.870 --> 03:40.655
Mom.

03:42.178 --> 03:44.267
Check the monitor.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.138
I'm fine.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.618
Just do it. Please?

03:49.185 --> 03:50.665
Yeah, I've...

03:51.666 --> 03:53.711
145 BPM.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.278
It's time to go
back upstairs.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.888
Just let me catch my breath.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.934
Let's do another loop
around the block.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.936
Dad, it's only been eight weeks.
Your body is still healing.

04:00.979 --> 04:03.025
You need to rest.
Go upstairs.

04:03.068 --> 04:05.549
I'll run to the market,
and if you're good,

04:05.593 --> 04:07.334
maybe I will let you
help me cook dinner later.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.031
Mémé's world

04:09.074 --> 04:10.032
If you're good.

04:10.075 --> 04:12.252
I'll be good.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.515
Okay.

04:14.558 --> 04:15.907
Bye.Bye.

04:28.311 --> 04:30.400
Yeah, I understand that, ma'am,
but I've called

04:30.444 --> 04:33.795
and left three messages
for our DIA liaison.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.971
Special Agent
Christopher Lasalle.

04:36.014 --> 04:38.408
Lasalle. L-A-S...

04:38.452 --> 04:41.193
You know what, forget it.
I'll call back later.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.195
Still no luck
with the DIA?No.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.546
I don't see how Pride does it.
I mean, sorting through

04:45.589 --> 04:47.722
all this red tape is like
a full-time job in itself.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.419
What about
Deputy Director Sanchez?

04:49.463 --> 04:51.595
Radio silence.
His assistant says

04:51.639 --> 04:53.989
he's in a budget
meeting all day.

04:54.032 --> 04:56.948
Well, maybe that's code
for catching a Nationals game.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.559
What are you
doing here, Pride?

04:58.602 --> 05:00.474
Nice to see you, too, Gregorio.

05:00.517 --> 05:01.475
Hi.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.867
Hi.

05:02.911 --> 05:03.912
You're looking good, King.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.174
One day at a time.

05:05.217 --> 05:06.480
Really happy to see you,

05:06.523 --> 05:07.959
but shouldn't you
be home resting?

05:08.003 --> 05:09.874
I'm taking a break
from taking a break.

05:09.918 --> 05:11.833
Don't worry,
it's just a social call.

05:11.876 --> 05:15.315
Good news: I got a hit on the
blood from the crate. It's a...

05:15.358 --> 05:16.707
Oh, thank God.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.579
Wha...? Seba...

05:18.622 --> 05:20.842
GREGORIO: Easy, baby.
He's still recovering.

05:20.885 --> 05:23.801
What? Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.195
It's okay, Se...
Sebastian, it's okay.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.941
Look, I know y'all
got work to do.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.943
I'm just gonna drop these
pastries in the kitchen,

05:34.986 --> 05:36.727
and then I'll get
out of your hair.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.121
Thank you, King.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.905
Yeah.

05:40.949 --> 05:44.474
You were saying you got a hit
off the blood from the crate?

05:44.518 --> 05:46.781
Yeah. So,
DNA from the crime scene

05:46.824 --> 05:50.959
matched an Interpol profile
for a particularly bad dude.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.135
LASALLE:
Terrance Desmond?Desmond was

05:53.178 --> 05:54.963
a former IRA bomb maker

05:55.006 --> 05:57.226
behind a 2004 pub explosion
that killed 18.

05:57.269 --> 05:59.184
Spent the last ten years

05:59.228 --> 06:00.838
selling his services
to the highest bidder.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.274
Navy was investigating
his involvement

06:02.318 --> 06:04.799
in a bombing attempt
in a forward staging base

06:04.842 --> 06:06.757
off the coast
of Yemen.
Yeah.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.585
About a month ago,
he just... he disappeared.

06:08.629 --> 06:09.847
Considering the
box he was in,

06:09.891 --> 06:11.327
I'd say it was more like taken.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.850
Yeah. Somebody wanted him back.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.896
Probably to build them a bomb.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.811
We got to find him now.What we need

06:16.854 --> 06:19.030
is more intel from HQ.
I mean, without it,

06:19.074 --> 06:20.858
we're swinging in the dark
while the clock keeps ticking.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.512
Maybe I can help.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.732
When it comes to getting DC
on the phone,

06:24.775 --> 06:26.516
I can be very persuasive.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.344
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Please enter

06:28.388 --> 06:29.911
your challenge word.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.870
Access granted.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.306
Thanks for taking
my call, Dan.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.004
To be honest, Dwayne,
I wasn't expecting

06:36.047 --> 06:38.267
to hear from you
for quite some time.

06:38.310 --> 06:40.008
I didn't know
you were back at work.I'm not.

06:40.051 --> 06:43.315
Just pinch-hitting.He's helping us on
an important case.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.317
This about the DIA
and the missing prisoner,

06:45.361 --> 06:47.145
Terrance Desmond?Kind of hard for us
to do our job

06:47.189 --> 06:48.451
when you don't answer
our calls, sir.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.453
Apologies, Agent Lasalle.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.890
Special Agent in Charge McGill
retired a month ago.

06:52.934 --> 06:55.850
We've had issues coordinating
our Southeast field offices.

06:55.893 --> 06:58.113
All the SSAs
formerly under his watch

06:58.156 --> 06:59.854
have unfortunately felt
the void.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.943
When is Director Vance
gonna pick a replacement?

07:01.986 --> 07:05.033
He already has. Look, Dwayne,
I was gonna fly down there

07:05.076 --> 07:06.643
to tell you this in person.Tell me what?

07:06.687 --> 07:07.949
You're the new SAC.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.341
That's funny.

07:09.385 --> 07:10.995
I'm not joking.
Yes, your methods

07:11.039 --> 07:13.258
have ruffled a few feathers,
but nobody can argue

07:13.302 --> 07:16.392
with your success rate
or level of commitment.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.655
The choice was
an easy one to make.

07:18.699 --> 07:21.223
Don't say no yet, Dwayne.

07:21.266 --> 07:24.052
Do me a personal favor
and think about it.

07:24.095 --> 07:27.403
Well, if Pride leaves, what
happens to NCIS New Orleans?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.797
Glad you asked.

07:48.424 --> 07:50.513
NCIS. Special Agent Khoury.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.648
We appreciate the support,
Sergeant Rivers.

07:54.691 --> 07:57.302
You'll have a full
suspect dossier in ten minutes.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.870
Sergeant, I cannot stress
enough how extremely dangerous

07:59.914 --> 08:01.089
Terrance Desmond is.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.873
Yeah, hang on a second, please?

08:02.917 --> 08:04.396
Sebastian,

08:04.440 --> 08:05.789
right?Mm.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.574
You have impeccable timing.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.750
:
Thank you.NOPD needs everything

08:09.793 --> 08:10.968
we've got on Terrance Desmond.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.535
Do you mind sending
those files over?

08:14.058 --> 08:16.321
Uh, yeah, I-I can do that.Great.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.323
While we're at it,
let's circle back with Interpol.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.499
See if you can get
whatever you can

08:19.542 --> 08:21.196
on friends, family,
known associates.

08:21.239 --> 08:23.938
It might shed some light on
some of our shooters, too.

08:23.981 --> 08:26.027
Uh, okay, yeah,
I'm-I'm all over it.Okay, great.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.071
And, Sebastian?

08:27.115 --> 08:28.943
You got a little something
on your...

08:30.031 --> 08:30.988
The other side.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.773
Oh.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.210
Okay.

08:35.253 --> 08:36.820
Who is she?

08:36.864 --> 08:38.213
I don't know.

08:38.256 --> 08:41.608
Why are you taking
orders from her?I don't know.

08:43.958 --> 08:47.004
Hey. Is there something
I can help you with, Ms....?

08:47.048 --> 08:48.223
Khoury.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.181
Hannah Khoury.
As a matter of fact, there is.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.705
Gregorio?Yeah.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.097
I could really use
your opinion.

08:53.141 --> 08:55.143
My opinion?Yeah. What if I
were to tell you

08:55.186 --> 08:58.189
our dead DIA clerks were
actually security specialists

08:58.233 --> 09:01.584
assigned to transfer high-value
detainees into Navy custody?

09:01.628 --> 09:04.239
I'd need more details
on the operation.What if there weren't any?

09:04.282 --> 09:06.284
What if the DIA was
only providing support

09:06.328 --> 09:08.722
for someone else's party?
A very private one,

09:08.765 --> 09:11.159
where the guests don't
officially exist.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.074
CIA ghost prisoners?

09:13.117 --> 09:14.771
Exactly what
I was thinking.

09:15.990 --> 09:19.036
Hey, what's going on, man?Um, the DIA

09:19.080 --> 09:21.735
is helping the CIA move
off-the-record detainees.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.867
Move them from where?Million dollar question,

09:23.911 --> 09:25.173
Patton, one of several.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.131
And since our
associates at Langley

09:27.175 --> 09:29.307
aren't known for their
warm and fuzzy cooperation,

09:29.351 --> 09:31.701
we're gonna have to find
the answers on our own.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.268
Who the hell are you?

09:33.311 --> 09:35.313
She's your new boss.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.884
Hi.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.810
This can't be happening.
He literally just got back.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.247
Why wouldn't Pride tell
us he's being replaced?

09:56.291 --> 09:59.033
He's not being replaced.
I'm sure he didn't say yes.

09:59.076 --> 10:01.905
PATTON: Well, what if he did?
What if he's really done?

10:01.949 --> 10:04.125
I don't want a new boss.
I like the one we have.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.866
Plus, I'm awful
with change.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.128
Pride'll sort things out.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.825
All right?
He always does.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.698
But no matter what happens,
we still need to track down

10:11.741 --> 10:15.484
who murdered two DIA agents
and find a missing bomb maker.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.533
PRIDE:
Sanchez thinks

10:21.577 --> 10:23.448
very highly of you.Well, then he has me

10:23.492 --> 10:25.842
at a disadvantage,
since I've never met the man.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.975
He offered you my job
for a reason.So you should know,

10:28.018 --> 10:29.541
I only considered the position

10:29.585 --> 10:32.283
after hearing that you would be
the new regional SAC.

10:33.589 --> 10:37.985
Rumors of my...
promotion have been

10:38.028 --> 10:39.508
greatly exaggerated.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.989
My apologies.
I'll remove my name

10:42.032 --> 10:44.339
from consideration.Don't. You've done
nothing wrong.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.777
From what I hear,
you're more than qualified

10:47.821 --> 10:49.387
to... fill my shoes.

10:49.431 --> 10:51.520
: That's an
impossible assignment,

10:51.563 --> 10:53.087
Special Agent
Pride, but...

10:53.130 --> 10:57.047
I will do my best,
ifI still have the job.

10:57.091 --> 11:01.399
You're modest for someone with
such an impressive track record.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.619
Same could be said of you.You've consulted

11:03.663 --> 11:06.404
with four different support
teams in less then two years.

11:06.448 --> 11:09.973
Naples, Bahrain,
Yokosuka, Hong Kong.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.715
Singapore, actually.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.499
What can I say,
I have a flair for the exotic.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.806
Then why take a full-time post
in New Orleans?

11:19.461 --> 11:21.289
I go where I'm needed.

11:21.332 --> 11:24.684
That's your answer
for the bosses.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.903
What's the real one?

11:28.949 --> 11:30.733
First, can I ask you something?

11:32.735 --> 11:35.172
Why did you come to work today?

11:35.216 --> 11:38.785
Nobody would have expected
you to come back so soon,

11:38.828 --> 11:43.006
if at all, but here you are.

11:43.050 --> 11:48.446
My guess is that once upon
a time you made a choice,

11:48.490 --> 11:53.234
you decided to put your job
above all else.

11:53.277 --> 11:56.193
Self-sacrifice
for the greater good.

11:56.237 --> 11:59.631
That what you're doing?

12:03.026 --> 12:05.333
Truth is, I'm tired
of living out of a suitcase.

12:05.376 --> 12:08.902
And I'm tired of saying good-bye
to friends.

12:08.945 --> 12:12.079
And I am tired of pretending

12:12.122 --> 12:16.648
that I don't need consistency
in my life.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.999
It's time to find a home.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.785
That said,

12:22.829 --> 12:25.092
I have no intention of
kicking you out of yours.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.747
And, until you say otherwise...

12:27.790 --> 12:30.401
I'm just a guest.

12:30.445 --> 12:33.796
And I'm just a guy
dropping off pastries.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.930
Understood.

12:36.973 --> 12:40.063
But since you are
already here,

12:40.107 --> 12:43.719
there's no harm in sticking
around for a minute.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.028
LAUREL:
Dad?!

12:49.507 --> 12:51.640
PRIDE:
I know I should have

12:51.683 --> 12:54.948
left you a note.Yeah, or called or texted,

12:54.991 --> 12:57.559
or just gone home like
you were supposed to.

12:57.602 --> 13:02.433
Look, Laurel...
I missed my team.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.914
I needed to know
they're all right.They're adults, Dad.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.351
I'm pretty sure they can be
trusted to survive a few months.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.788
You, on the other hand...

13:08.831 --> 13:10.093
I'm fine.You keep saying that,

13:10.137 --> 13:11.660
but less than two months ago

13:11.703 --> 13:13.575
you were dying on
an operating table.

13:13.618 --> 13:16.708
And the first chance you get,
you race back into the chaos.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.930
I don't know what to say.Then just...

13:20.974 --> 13:23.150
listen.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.805
When they first told me
you'd been shot,

13:25.848 --> 13:27.937
all I could think about was
never seeing you again.

13:27.981 --> 13:31.549
About never playing the piano
with you, or never laughing

13:31.593 --> 13:33.377
at your corny dad jokes.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.903
And, in that moment, I've never
felt more alone or afraid.

13:36.946 --> 13:39.296
But you're not alone.
I'm right here.

13:39.340 --> 13:42.212
Yeah, but for how long?

13:43.561 --> 13:45.128
I'm asking you to
really start looking

13:45.172 --> 13:46.564
at the priorities
in your life.

13:46.608 --> 13:49.393
You will always be what's
most important to me.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.310
But I have responsibilities.

13:53.354 --> 13:56.139
Your responsibility
is to get better.

13:56.183 --> 14:00.056
The new agent just asked for
my help with some paperwork,

14:00.100 --> 14:02.363
a little research,
that's all.

14:02.406 --> 14:05.279
The team needs me.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.850
I just wish you'd
let someone else

14:10.893 --> 14:12.852
wear the cape every
once in a while.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.856
Look...

14:16.899 --> 14:19.859
No capes for me right now,
sweetie. I promise.

14:23.210 --> 14:28.084
But I just want you
to know that...

14:28.128 --> 14:32.306
I don't think I'm ever
gonna give up the tights.

14:32.349 --> 14:34.743
No, I'm serious.

14:37.528 --> 14:40.096
Hey, just had a chat
with an old friend

14:40.140 --> 14:42.055
from CIA Military Affairs.

14:42.098 --> 14:45.058
Let me guess, there's no
official record of any joint

14:45.101 --> 14:48.017
CIA/DoD op involving
ghost detainees.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.410
Well, according to the Agency,

14:49.453 --> 14:51.629
there's no such thing
as ghosts, period.

14:51.673 --> 14:54.458
I'm hoping your "old friend" has
a differing opinion.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.417
On the record, no,

14:56.460 --> 14:59.550
on the DL, undocumented
prisoners might just exist.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.335
And if they did,
the most valuable ones

15:01.378 --> 15:03.337
might be trackable through
an RF microchip.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.209
I've heard rumors of GPS
trackers being implanted

15:06.253 --> 15:09.212
without detainees' consent
or even knowledge.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.171
Hey, if we could get
the chip RFID,

15:11.214 --> 15:14.043
Patton might be able to pinpoint
his exact location.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.132
I'm gonna try Sanchez.

15:16.176 --> 15:17.133
Great job, Gregorio.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.439
Thanks.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.666
All right, well,

15:28.710 --> 15:30.277
according to the GPS, Desmond's
somewhere in that barn.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.195
GREGORIO:
I got four additional targets.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.631
LASALLE:
Yeah, could be more inside.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.198
I called backup, they should
be here in ten minutes.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.113
That chopper could be airborne
before they arrive.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.505
We take them now.

15:52.603 --> 15:55.041
♪

16:06.139 --> 16:07.531
Desmond.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.318
Gregorio, move!

16:13.755 --> 16:15.713
NCIS! Drop your weapons!

16:21.154 --> 16:22.416
Let's go!

16:41.348 --> 16:42.610
Check the barn!

16:50.357 --> 16:53.142
Desmond.
Show us your hands.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.107
Damn it.

17:05.241 --> 17:07.113
Why rescue a bomb maker,

17:07.156 --> 17:08.375
only to kill him before
he even makes one?

17:08.418 --> 17:09.985
It was never gonna happen.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.639
At least not with the supplies
that we found in that barn.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.510
Well, I see a lot of parts
on that table.

17:13.554 --> 17:16.122
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, except there's no rhyme
or reason for any of them.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.427
Robert Oppenheimer
couldn't have made a bomb

17:17.471 --> 17:18.907
from that pile of crap.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.213
Something's not making sense.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.953
What are we missing here?

17:21.997 --> 17:24.956
What else do we know about
the men in black?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.741
Only that they're great at
covering their tracks.

17:26.784 --> 17:28.917
There was no bio-trace
at that crime scene.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.527
No hair. No fingerprints.
Nothing.

17:30.571 --> 17:31.876
HANNAH:
Fortunately for us,

17:31.920 --> 17:33.443
they did leave something behind.

17:34.618 --> 17:39.101
We struck out on print and DNA.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.581
Still no positive I.D.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.496
Rules him out as
former military.

17:42.539 --> 17:43.932
At least not American.

17:43.975 --> 17:47.631
I think this one's gonna
be a tough nut to crack.

17:49.590 --> 17:53.028
Well, it's a good thing we've
got an interrogation expert

17:53.072 --> 17:55.683
to get the job done.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.999
Want to tell me your name?

18:12.874 --> 18:14.658
Okay, I will, uh,

18:14.702 --> 18:16.573
I'll tell you mine.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.097
It's Hannah.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.621
Today's my first day

18:20.664 --> 18:22.710
on a new job, and, the truth is,

18:22.753 --> 18:25.191
I am kind of nervous.

18:25.234 --> 18:29.108
There is a quick and painless
way to do this.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.805
Oh, yeah?

18:30.848 --> 18:32.154
You mean the one that
makes you look good,

18:32.198 --> 18:33.851
look good in front
of your boss.

18:33.895 --> 18:36.637
He's literally watching
every move I make.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.161
We already know...

18:39.205 --> 18:41.685
you didn't rescue
Terrance Desmond

18:41.729 --> 18:45.036
to build a bomb.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.126
So why'd you take him?

18:47.169 --> 18:49.258
If your mission
was to kill him,

18:49.302 --> 18:51.086
why did you wait
till we arrived?

18:51.130 --> 18:54.872
Why stick around
and risk being caught?

18:58.093 --> 19:00.139
I think the mission
was poorly planned.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.097
I think it was
badly executed.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.753
Maybe your boss isn't
as good as you thought.

19:05.796 --> 19:08.016
Because when
the crap hit the fan,

19:08.059 --> 19:09.974
you were the one left
holding the bag.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.194
On the hook for not one,
but three murders.

19:12.238 --> 19:15.545
You were abandoned.
You were betrayed.

19:15.589 --> 19:18.157
And I'm not surprised
because I've seen it before.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.594
The weakest link,
the runt of the litter,

19:20.637 --> 19:22.552
is always thrown
to the wolves.

19:22.596 --> 19:26.643
First of all, I'm not a runt.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.210
And second,

19:28.254 --> 19:30.995
I didn't kill anybody.

19:31.039 --> 19:33.215
I was hired last second

19:33.259 --> 19:35.348
for this job to
replace a no

19:37.219 --> 19:40.831
Look, you don't
know these people.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.572
The things that
they would do to me

19:42.616 --> 19:43.965
if they, if they
even thought...

19:44.008 --> 19:46.054
They already think
you are talking.

19:46.097 --> 19:48.578
Right now, we're
your only protection

19:48.622 --> 19:50.580
from the things
that they would do.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.063
S... Smith.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.633
That's the name
of the team leader.

19:59.676 --> 20:03.202
And the mission?I don't ask questions.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.465
In hindsight, that probably
wasn't the best policy.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.861
Wait.

20:13.299 --> 20:15.910
The helicopter was supposed to
take us to a private airstrip,

20:15.953 --> 20:18.042
and there was supposed to be
a jet that met us there.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.262
And that is all that I know.

20:20.306 --> 20:21.916
I swear.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.008
You believe him?

20:27.051 --> 20:28.270
Not a word.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.359
Me neither. But...

20:30.403 --> 20:32.013
But what?

20:32.056 --> 20:34.363
Due diligence,
with an abundance of caution.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.235
We roll the dice, check out
every private airstrip

20:36.278 --> 20:37.236
in a hundred-mile radius.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.715
It's the only play we got.

20:38.759 --> 20:39.847
Smith and his men have
a huge head start.

20:39.890 --> 20:40.935
We need to move fast.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.197
Tammy, Sebastian
and I will split up.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.025
Cover more ground that way.

20:44.068 --> 20:46.506
Have Patton coordinate backup in
each location. Just in case.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.203
You got it.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.727
I'm gonna do another round
with our mystery guest.

20:50.771 --> 20:52.163
He knows more
than he's saying.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.252
I'm right behind you.

20:57.212 --> 20:58.692
Dwayne.

20:58.735 --> 21:01.303
Loretta.
I brought my report
on Terrance Desmond.

21:01.347 --> 21:05.133
Came all this way just to
deliver autopsy results?

21:05.176 --> 21:07.266
That's not a
"happy to see me" face.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.137
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.226
I'm just wondering what
your ulterior motive is.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.185
Okay. You got me. Somebody told
me that you were back at work.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.187
Don't bother asking who.Laurel.

21:16.231 --> 21:17.537
You're damn right, Laurel.

21:17.580 --> 21:21.323
Loretta, I'm riding a desk
helping the team.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.760
With all due respect, last thing
I need is another lecture

21:23.804 --> 21:26.241
on how I'm pushing myself
too hard.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.765
I knew you wouldn't
listen anyway.

21:28.809 --> 21:31.202
You know you can't teach
an old dog.

21:31.246 --> 21:34.423
Even an old dog can see miracles
don't happen every day.

21:34.467 --> 21:38.166
I know how blessed I am.

21:38.209 --> 21:40.429
Do you, Dwayne?

21:40.473 --> 21:42.997
The things you saw when you
were in the other place--

21:43.040 --> 21:44.564
they weren't random.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.696
Everything happens
for a reason.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.439
What do you think
that reason is?

21:50.483 --> 21:53.050
Doesn't matter
what I think.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.314
You have to find the
answer for yourself.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.272
There's no other way.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.319
Now, do you want
to hear my report

22:00.362 --> 22:02.233
on Terrance Desmond or not?

22:02.277 --> 22:03.974
Please.

22:04.018 --> 22:07.238
Okay. Cause of death is
a GSW to the neurocranium.

22:07.282 --> 22:09.328
There's no surprise there,

22:09.371 --> 22:12.940
but the time of death-- now
that is rather unexpected.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.944
Based on body temp
and lividity, I'd say

22:16.987 --> 22:18.946
he'd already been dead
at least 18 hours.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.991
18. Excuse me, Loretta.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.127
:
Oh.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.522
I'm okay.

22:35.223 --> 22:37.747
We've got a problem.He isn't talking?

22:37.791 --> 22:39.793
I'm not seeing any
of the vulnerability

22:39.836 --> 22:42.186
I'd expect
from a frightened subordinate.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.537
Desmond wasn't
killed in that barn.

22:44.580 --> 22:47.757
He was shot right after
they took him from the dock.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.933
Why make an assassination look
like a rescue?

22:49.977 --> 22:52.936
Maybe they knew we'd use the
GPS chip to track Desmond.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.677
Maybe they wanted
us to find him.Why?

22:54.721 --> 22:56.679
So we could arrest one of
their own and bring him here.

22:56.723 --> 22:57.898
He only told us
about the airstrip

22:57.941 --> 22:59.073
so we'd send everyone away.

22:59.116 --> 23:00.379
They're gonna attack NCIS.Yeah.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.119
We need to call NOPD now.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.081
Go, go, go, go, go!

23:07.124 --> 23:08.648
Come on! Run!

23:26.056 --> 23:28.015
You're three minutes late.

23:28.058 --> 23:30.104
Apologies, sir.
We were waiting

23:30.147 --> 23:32.628
for Lasalle, Gregorio and Lund
to clear the neighborhood.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.283
What about Pride,
Plame and the cop?

23:35.326 --> 23:37.285
I'm securing them as we speak.There's another agent

23:37.328 --> 23:39.461
in the building-- Hannah.
Find her.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.637
On it.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.175
:
Okay.

23:58.219 --> 23:59.786
You all right?Yeah.

24:02.310 --> 24:03.746
HANNAH :
There's no signal.

24:03.790 --> 24:06.793
Landlines and computer
communications are down, too.

24:06.836 --> 24:08.316
They must be using a jammer.

24:08.359 --> 24:10.971
Yeah, we're on our own.

24:13.843 --> 24:15.497
My gun's locked
in observation.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.020
Yeah, mine's at home.

24:17.064 --> 24:18.718
Weapons locker?
Squad room.

24:18.761 --> 24:20.197
We'll never make it
without getting spotted.

24:20.241 --> 24:22.243
I got something.What?

24:25.028 --> 24:27.770
I keep this in case somebody
want to start something.

24:27.814 --> 24:30.338
It's impressive,
but I don't think

24:30.381 --> 24:31.905
it's gonna do much
against submachine guns.

24:31.948 --> 24:33.776
So what you're saying is

24:33.820 --> 24:36.387
we're screwed?Not just us, P.

24:37.432 --> 24:39.347
Move it!

24:43.351 --> 24:46.267
Take the cop
to see Smith.

24:46.310 --> 24:47.486
Let's go.

24:55.581 --> 24:56.886
SMITH:
All right, listen up.

24:56.930 --> 25:00.281
Hide and seek is over,
boys and girls.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.588
So, do yourself a favor

25:02.631 --> 25:05.242
and come out now.

25:05.286 --> 25:07.375
PATTON:
Oh, man,

25:07.418 --> 25:08.637
they got Roy.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.467
But not Loretta.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.295
Maybe she got out
of the building.

25:15.949 --> 25:17.907
No.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.648
She's still inside.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.390
How can you be sure?
I...

25:22.433 --> 25:25.480
I just am.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.621
SMITH:
Now, I'm gonna count

25:35.664 --> 25:37.623
to three.

25:37.666 --> 25:40.277
And then, if you
don't show yourselves,

25:40.321 --> 25:44.499
I'm gonna shoot Officer
Friendly right in the face.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.110
I got a plan.We're all ears.

25:47.154 --> 25:50.026
We surrender.That's not funny.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.854
It's the only way.

25:51.898 --> 25:53.813
He's right.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.249
One.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.429
Two.

26:01.472 --> 26:04.432
Hey, if we get killed,
I'm gonna be pissed.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.348
Okay.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.437
We're coming out!

26:09.480 --> 26:11.657
We're unarmed!

26:23.712 --> 26:25.409
Well, hey there, friends.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.281
You're the leader.

26:27.324 --> 26:28.891
You're Smith.

26:28.935 --> 26:30.240
Surprise.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.852
What do you want?Well, for starters,

26:32.895 --> 26:35.985
I'm, uh, I'm gonna need the
key fob to your SCIF room.

26:36.029 --> 26:38.422
You can have mine...

26:38.466 --> 26:41.687
but first you need
to let everyone else go.

26:48.519 --> 26:51.305
Give me the damn key fob.

26:51.348 --> 26:55.526
After... you let
everyone else go.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.180
Okay.

27:04.753 --> 27:06.668
HANNAH:
Stop it!

27:06.712 --> 27:08.365
Take mine.

27:08.409 --> 27:10.411
Come on.

27:12.065 --> 27:15.634
I'm gonna need your
challenge word, too, please?

27:17.592 --> 27:20.203
You know, this time,

27:20.247 --> 27:22.249
I'm not even gonna count.

27:22.728 --> 27:25.426
I'll just kill him.

27:55.021 --> 27:57.806
Athena.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.329
The challenge word is "Athena."

28:02.768 --> 28:04.552
Too late.

28:08.338 --> 28:10.166
It's your lucky day.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.605
Shut that damn thing off.

28:14.649 --> 28:17.608
Take the cop, lock
him in the bathroom.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.791
SMITH: If they try
anything, shoot them all.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.767
Slow, deep breaths.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.334
In through the nose.

28:47.377 --> 28:48.901
Out through the mouth.

28:52.165 --> 28:53.644
I've never seen him like this.

28:53.688 --> 28:56.822
He's gonna be okay.
We all will.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.693
You know something I don't?

28:58.737 --> 29:00.739
Just be ready.

29:00.782 --> 29:03.132
Hey, sit down!It's a trap.

29:03.176 --> 29:05.004
I told you, sit down.

29:05.047 --> 29:07.833
The challenge word I gave
Smith is a panic code.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.748
Within minutes of using it,

29:09.791 --> 29:12.446
this place is gonna be
swarming with feds.You're full of it.

29:12.489 --> 29:15.971
You really think Smith would be
willing to take that chance?

29:19.409 --> 29:22.891
Cover them.
I'll talk to Smith.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.478
Damn it!

29:44.521 --> 29:46.393
Kill 'em all.

29:53.966 --> 29:54.793
Move! Move! Move!

29:58.971 --> 30:01.800
Get down!

30:36.269 --> 30:37.792
Well, every cop in New Orleans

30:37.836 --> 30:39.576
is out looking
for Smith and his team.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.622
No surprise, we didn't find a
jet waiting to whisk them away.

30:41.665 --> 30:43.015
It was a wild-goose
chase to split us up.

30:43.058 --> 30:44.581
SCIF was always
the target.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.932
So these psychos
killed two DIA agents

30:46.975 --> 30:49.151
and staged an elaborate rescue
of Desmond

30:49.195 --> 30:50.979
just to access
our secure network?

30:51.023 --> 30:52.763
Yeah. Question is why?

30:52.807 --> 30:54.200
Smith blew up the SCIF terminal.

30:54.243 --> 30:57.029
But network activity is recorded
on off-site servers.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.683
I'll see every file he
accessed. It'll take time.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.424
Time is what he was buying
himself to complete his mission.

31:01.468 --> 31:02.948
We don't even know
what that mission is

31:02.991 --> 31:04.166
or who these guys really are.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.994
Yeah, but thanks to Pride,

31:06.038 --> 31:09.345
we got something
that might help us find out.

31:09.389 --> 31:11.957
WhatClose enough.

31:15.090 --> 31:17.092
Hey, Rita, it's me.

31:17.136 --> 31:20.052
Nothing's wrong.
I just want to hear your voice.

31:20.095 --> 31:22.097
Call me when you get this.

31:27.102 --> 31:30.062
Heard we missed quite a party.

31:30.105 --> 31:32.064
Food was good.

31:32.107 --> 31:34.109
Band sucked.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.505
King, we need to talk
about what happened.

31:40.115 --> 31:42.248
Everybody's safe.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.119
That's all that matters.

31:44.163 --> 31:47.079
You had a loaded gun
pointed to your face.

31:47.122 --> 31:48.819
Yeah.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.171
I knew it was gonna misfire.

31:52.214 --> 31:54.956
How could you have
possibly known that?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.611
I can't explain it.

31:57.654 --> 32:02.181
But in the moment before
he pulled the trigger,

32:02.224 --> 32:05.010
I saw I was gonna
be all right.

32:09.144 --> 32:11.103
What I didn't see

32:11.146 --> 32:14.367
was how we were being
manipulated from the start.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.238
We all missed that.

32:16.282 --> 32:18.719
Pieces were there.

32:18.762 --> 32:22.244
Just didn't put 'em together,
and we all paid a price.

32:22.288 --> 32:24.507
No, we're gonna make this right.

32:24.551 --> 32:27.946
All right, we're gonna
find these guys.Yeah.

32:27.989 --> 32:31.993
Then I need to make things
right with my daughter.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.212
Need to call her?

32:33.255 --> 32:34.996
I already did.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.999
Of course I couldn't tell
her what happened here.

32:38.043 --> 32:39.827
Not yet anyway.

32:39.870 --> 32:43.091
No need to make her worry
any more than she already has.

32:43.135 --> 32:45.702
Long as I'm doing this job,
she's gonna worry.

32:45.746 --> 32:48.053
Just like her mom.

32:48.096 --> 32:52.274
Especially when riding a desk
almost bought me a bullet.

32:54.059 --> 32:57.453
Maybe that regional SAC
promotion isn't the worst idea.

32:57.497 --> 32:59.064
Plus...

32:59.107 --> 33:01.849
you'd do a hell of a job at it.

33:01.892 --> 33:05.070
Just focus on Smith
and his team for now, huh?

33:05.113 --> 33:07.028
Hey, you guys
need to see this.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.857
I got an I.D.
off those fingers.

33:09.900 --> 33:11.293
Roger Beeg.

33:11.337 --> 33:13.861
Washed out of the Air Force
before moving overseas

33:13.904 --> 33:16.429
to fly for a handful of
private military outfits.

33:16.472 --> 33:19.127
Interpol's latest intel has him
linked to another mercenary,

33:19.171 --> 33:20.302
Avery Walker.

33:20.346 --> 33:22.304
Smith.Yeah, one and the same.

33:22.348 --> 33:23.740
Walker was an independent
security contractor

33:23.784 --> 33:25.133
in the Middle East.

33:25.177 --> 33:26.352
Then he started working

33:26.395 --> 33:28.136
for a Russian oligarch
named Sergei Leonid.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.573
Runs an international
crime syndicate with ties

33:30.617 --> 33:32.706
to at least three foreign
terrorist organizations.

33:32.749 --> 33:34.273
Yeah, CIA's been trying
to get this guy

33:34.316 --> 33:35.491
for years,
but he's always managed

33:35.535 --> 33:38.016
to stay one step ahead
until recently.

33:38.059 --> 33:40.670
Unidentified gunmen abducted
Leonid from a Moscow hotel

33:40.714 --> 33:43.238
about a month ago.PATTON:
Get this.

33:43.282 --> 33:45.110
Smith used SCIF to access intel

33:45.153 --> 33:47.373
on the CIA's
interrogation program

33:47.416 --> 33:49.070
that uses floating
black sites

33:49.114 --> 33:50.158
on international waters.

33:50.202 --> 33:51.333
Away from American soil.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.118
And all civil rights.

33:53.161 --> 33:54.249
What exactly
was Smith looking for?

33:54.293 --> 33:56.077
Classified coordinates

33:56.121 --> 33:59.037
of the CIA's ship
anchored 30 nautical miles

33:59.080 --> 34:00.603
south of the Louisiana
coastline.

34:00.647 --> 34:02.040
PRIDE: I'm guessing
the same one

34:02.083 --> 34:04.390
Terrance Desmond departed from
in a crate.

34:04.433 --> 34:06.261
Desmond's not the only
familiar name

34:06.305 --> 34:07.436
on that ship's guest list.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.395
Sergei Leonid.

34:10.657 --> 34:11.701
Smith knew Desmond

34:11.745 --> 34:13.007
was coming in at that dock,

34:13.051 --> 34:14.487
but he didn't know
where he was coming from.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.097
He needed those coordinates
from SCIF

34:16.141 --> 34:17.403
so he could rescue his boss.

34:17.446 --> 34:18.926
All right, look,
we need to contact that ship

34:18.969 --> 34:20.145
right away.

34:20.188 --> 34:22.060
I don't know
who authorized this call,

34:22.103 --> 34:23.496
but you've violated
at least six

34:23.539 --> 34:25.150
different DoD protocols
by even making it.

34:25.193 --> 34:27.152
Captain, you are facing
an imminent attack.

34:27.195 --> 34:29.632
You need to get your vessel
underway immediately.

34:29.676 --> 34:30.807
I can't do that

34:30.851 --> 34:31.939
without direct orders
from Langley.

34:31.982 --> 34:34.246
And while I appreciate
your concern,

34:34.289 --> 34:35.812
I assure you
we can handle any threat

34:35.856 --> 34:38.250
that comes our way.

34:38.293 --> 34:39.338
Captain, wait.

35:01.490 --> 35:06.756
[indistinct announcement
over speakers]

35:06.800 --> 35:08.367
Four-man crew is dead

35:08.410 --> 35:10.325
along with two
CIA interrogators.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.110
And Leonid?HANNAH: Gone.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.460
Navy and Coast Guard
are searching for him.

35:14.503 --> 35:16.462
Looking for a needle
in a haystack.

35:16.505 --> 35:17.985
Yeah. Like,
500 square miles worth.

35:18.028 --> 35:20.553
Maybe Leonid was implanted
with a tracking chip

35:20.596 --> 35:22.076
like Desmond's.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.470
He was... until it got cut out.

35:24.513 --> 35:25.732
Damn.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.125
Smith has anticipated

35:27.168 --> 35:29.475
every one of our moves so far.Well,

35:29.518 --> 35:30.606
then he also knows
we'll be searching

35:30.650 --> 35:31.738
for him in the open water.

35:31.781 --> 35:33.261
He must have another
exit strategy.

35:33.305 --> 35:34.784
Pride, I got something.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.612
H-Hang on.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.962
Go.Ghost ship coordinates

35:39.006 --> 35:40.703
weren't the only thing
that Smith was after.

35:40.747 --> 35:44.446
He also accessed
a classified joint DoD/FAA file.

35:44.490 --> 35:46.274
Why would he be interested
in the FAA?

35:46.318 --> 35:48.624
Government transponder codes.
Every aircraft has one,

35:48.668 --> 35:50.844
even military
and classified ones.

35:50.887 --> 35:54.064
DoD provides the codes
of their planes to the FAA

35:54.108 --> 35:55.805
so they won't have to interact

35:55.849 --> 35:57.720
with any civilian
air traffic control.Yeah.

35:57.764 --> 35:59.505
It makes flying the friendly
skies even friendlier.

35:59.548 --> 36:00.810
PRIDE:
Smith could spoof

36:00.854 --> 36:04.031
a classified DoD transponder
and fly anywhere

36:04.074 --> 36:06.381
without being stopped
or tracked.Yeah, all he needs

36:06.425 --> 36:08.253
is a plane and a trained pilot.

36:11.647 --> 36:12.605
Roger Beeg.

36:12.648 --> 36:14.215
Pride, what do we got?

36:14.259 --> 36:15.695
The answer.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.914
Turns out Smith wasn't lying
about everything.

36:18.959 --> 36:21.222
Our chariot awaits.

36:22.876 --> 36:25.879
What did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you?

36:25.922 --> 36:27.707
All right,
everybody, load up!

36:27.750 --> 36:29.317
We're gonna be
there in no time.

36:30.971 --> 36:33.756
Federal agents,
stay where you are.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.629
Do not move
or we will open fire!

36:36.672 --> 36:37.804
Keep your hands above your head.

36:37.847 --> 36:40.807
Do not move
or we will open fire.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.983
Keep your hands above your head.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.419
Down on your knees!

36:44.463 --> 36:45.855
Get down!

36:49.946 --> 36:50.947
Let's go.

36:50.991 --> 36:52.384
Don't move.Aah!

37:04.091 --> 37:06.049
Walker, stop!

37:06.093 --> 37:07.747
Get your hands
where I can see them.

37:07.790 --> 37:09.357
Now.

37:12.317 --> 37:13.666
You won't make it.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.062
You're sweating.

37:21.108 --> 37:22.805
Your hand is shaking, too.

37:22.849 --> 37:26.069
I assume your heart's going
a million miles a minute.

37:26.113 --> 37:29.464
Adrenaline overloading
your nervous system.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.031
You know what
that's called?

37:31.074 --> 37:33.076
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

37:34.643 --> 37:37.907
So I think it's you
who's not gonna make it.

37:37.951 --> 37:39.344
Only one way to find out.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.438
But if you go
for that weapon,

37:46.481 --> 37:49.267
I will shoot you.

37:49.310 --> 37:52.357
Chances are good that my...

37:52.400 --> 37:54.881
my gun won't misfire.

37:54.924 --> 37:57.666
So what do you think, Walker?

37:57.710 --> 38:00.582
Are you a gambling man?

38:00.626 --> 38:02.541
Huh?

38:03.150 --> 38:04.891
Down on the ground!

38:04.934 --> 38:06.588
MAN:
Don't move!

38:13.508 --> 38:14.770
I guess you were right.

38:16.381 --> 38:18.557
Today is my lucky day.

38:26.391 --> 38:29.002
You all right, boss?

38:29.045 --> 38:30.960
Yeah. Yeah.

38:31.004 --> 38:33.006
Never been better.

38:50.371 --> 38:51.720
Yeah!

38:55.420 --> 38:58.684
Well, it is not the first
day that I expected,

38:58.727 --> 39:04.429
but a win is a win, even if I am
covered in scrapes and bruises.

39:04.472 --> 39:06.605

39:06.648 --> 39:08.215

39:08.258 --> 39:09.390
