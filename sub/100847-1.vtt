00:57.140 --> 00:59.132
We were in Brazil.

00:59.518 --> 01:02.636
The night before,
Luciano sang for 200,000 people.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.893
It was an amazing concert in Buenos Aires.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.311
The next morning,
we went up the Amazon, into the jungle.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.188
Thankfully, I had my video camera.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.820
There was this theater
in the middle of nowhere,

01:17.411 --> 01:19.869
and, uh, I realized this was a pilgrimage.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.249
And Luciano said,

01:23.333 --> 01:27.293
"I want to sing on this stage
where Caruso sang 100 years ago."

01:30.090 --> 01:32.298
You know, we had nothing organized.

01:34.595 --> 01:39.340
We arrive in front of the theater,
and it was completely locked up.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.514
Nobody was there.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.143
We found somebody, uh, to open it.

01:46.898 --> 01:50.232
And somebody came out
and said, uh, "Who is he?"

01:51.403 --> 01:54.191
And he said, "I am Luciano Pavarotti."

03:50.856 --> 03:53.394
Luciano never had a plan in his mind

03:53.483 --> 03:56.066
and was not somebody
that planned things, you know?

03:57.279 --> 03:58.520
Things just happened.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.368
One day, we receive a video camera.

04:05.454 --> 04:09.073
So, I was always there with this camera,
and we shoot everything.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.955
He really trust people.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.959
He always thought
that everybody had a good part, you know?

04:18.341 --> 04:21.584
He was so full of joy
and so happy all the time.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.059
Luciano was completely conscious
of the fact

04:30.145 --> 04:32.353
that he received a great gift from God.

04:34.399 --> 04:38.439
Not just in opera,
but everything else in life.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.902
It gave him purpose.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.364
But it was also a burden.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.872
I always wanted to understand
the reason why.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.448
Our profession
is a very, very particular one.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.652
You don't become well-known in a day.

06:12.163 --> 06:16.828
In this growing, you don't realize
what is going to happen to you.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.956
You don't know who you are, really.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.881
I was born during the war,
so, I am carrying that.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.841
Always.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.141
But I was a very lucky boy,

06:34.227 --> 06:37.766
because I was raised
in the most beautiful place.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.399
My father was a baker and a tenor.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.862
I was very lucky
to have my father singing in the church.

06:56.374 --> 07:02.496
Even for a little boy, by imitation,
you always do what your father is doing,

07:02.589 --> 07:04.376
so he was my teacher.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.626
It was a fantastic tenor voice.

07:09.512 --> 07:13.927
Phenomenal. Better than mine.
And nobody believed, but he was like that.

07:17.604 --> 07:22.065
I was singing with my father
and 50 more male voice.

07:23.443 --> 07:27.232
We went to this place in Wales
to make a competition.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.402
1955, you won first prize in Wales.

07:34.496 --> 07:35.496
Yes.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.574
That was one of the most important
and unforgettable day of my life.

07:40.752 --> 07:44.462
And sharing it with all my friends
and with my father.

07:48.593 --> 07:53.054
And that time,
I was a teacher for elementary school.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.631
My father, he says, "Listen.

07:56.267 --> 08:00.477
Now you study, you go to the city,
and you become professor."

08:00.563 --> 08:04.102
Because my father
did not succeed as a tenor.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.560
He knows how difficult it is,
even with a beautiful voice.

08:08.488 --> 08:12.949
And I say,
"Okay, if you say so, I will do that."

08:13.034 --> 08:17.324
My mother says, "No, I think,

08:17.414 --> 08:22.330
when I hear my son sing,
I have something in my heart."

08:22.419 --> 08:25.253
Oh, I say, "Mama, you say that
because you are my mother. Come on."

08:25.338 --> 08:27.045
She says, "No, no, no, no.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.840
No, because I don't say that
when I hear your father."

08:33.013 --> 08:38.554
She make me do exactly what I want,
and I think for what I was born to do.

08:41.104 --> 08:44.848
So, in 1955, I begin to study,

08:44.941 --> 08:48.981
and six year after,
I made my debut in 1961.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.703
So, how did you get
your first part in an opera?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.409
I won a competition,

09:05.503 --> 09:08.541
and the prize of the competition
was to sing on the stage

09:08.631 --> 09:11.715
with an orchestra with a conductor
with, uh, the entire performance.

09:11.801 --> 09:18.298
And my debut was the 29th of April, 1961,
and I was playing Rodolfo in <i>Bohème.</i>

09:18.391 --> 09:19.711
In <i>La bohème,</i> yeah.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.759
It was not a sensational night,

09:21.853 --> 09:25.142
but I think everybody was very pleased,
especially my mother.

11:00.410 --> 11:04.529
The 29th of April, 1961,

11:04.622 --> 11:10.209
a young elementary school teacher
went on the stage, and he become a tenor.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.166
And I fall in love.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.926
We did live together a couple of months.
Really like bohemians.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.602
I remember that we have the room,
one in front of the other,

11:28.688 --> 11:30.395
and the bathroom was there for everybody.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.523
It's love. It's passion.
It's very beautiful. It's casual.

11:40.617 --> 11:44.702
It's everything poetic and romantic
and positive in life.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.451
And desperate,
because there is... that is there.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.397
London is an incredible city,

12:17.487 --> 12:21.606
and Covent Garden is my first
important international theater.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.777
I sang there in 1963 with great success.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.748
Covent Garden was making
ten performance of <i>Bohème.</i>

12:32.752 --> 12:34.994
Performances with Mr. Di Stefano,

12:35.088 --> 12:37.501
who is one of the greatest tenor
of all time.

12:38.341 --> 12:41.505
And then, when he is arriving,
he was very sick,

12:41.594 --> 12:46.259
and he's canceling the performance,
and I am singing in his place.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.928
And the news was incredible,

12:49.018 --> 12:51.977
because young tenor
will substitute Di Stefano.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.929
The work is Di Stefano,

12:54.607 --> 12:57.270
but doesn't matter
because the young tenor was me.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.197
Finally, I am reaching that point

13:04.284 --> 13:07.322
in which you are able
to deal with the stage.

13:08.246 --> 13:12.081
It's still difficult, but you made it.
So I made it.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.670
It was very early in my career.

13:21.759 --> 13:26.220
I was going to make my debut
in Vienna in '67.

13:26.306 --> 13:30.095
And I had been reading
about this new superstar

13:30.560 --> 13:33.394
that was singing
with JJoan Sutherland in a tour.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.559
Going to Australia with Joan,

13:36.649 --> 13:40.108
first of all, I learned to be
a very serious professional singer.

13:40.737 --> 13:45.152
And from her, particularly,
I learned to breathe,

13:45.241 --> 13:48.530
which is the most simple thing
but the most difficult.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.737
What did you learn? How could you tell
what was going on inside?

13:52.081 --> 13:55.791
Well, while singing a duet,
I tried to touch her to see

13:55.877 --> 13:58.665
how she was doing, and...

13:58.755 --> 14:01.714
What did you feel?
Could you feel the air?

14:01.799 --> 14:03.586
- I saw the muscle of the diaphragm.
- Yeah.

14:03.718 --> 14:09.214
And she use... and how firm the muscle was
before she attack any kind of note.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.675
More than everything,
I think the technique is perfect.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.386
I think it's probably
the most incredible technique

14:15.480 --> 14:17.346
of all the time, I would like to say.

14:43.007 --> 14:48.753
I think Luciano has
one of the most ideal voice

14:48.846 --> 14:52.681
ever born on this Earth,
at least for a tenor.

14:54.477 --> 14:57.140
Luciano's voice
always went right to my heart.

14:57.980 --> 15:03.066
It was just one of the clearest,
most pure, most emotional,

15:03.152 --> 15:06.691
passionate, beautiful... everything.

15:06.781 --> 15:09.444
It's just heaven on earth, truly.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.615
It's very important
to make people understand

15:17.708 --> 15:22.169
that a soprano and a baritone,
they are the most natural voices.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.339
Men, they are naturally baritones.

15:25.425 --> 15:29.715
But to become a tenor,
that's another thing. It's more unnatural.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.647
If you want
to become Luciano Pavarotti,

15:49.740 --> 15:51.606
you must have the high C.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.159
That's the most important thing.

15:54.245 --> 15:57.784
You can have a beautiful,
nice life of the tenor,

15:57.874 --> 16:01.788
but if you don't have a high C,
no big tenor.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.670
When I was listening to Luciano, you know,

16:05.756 --> 16:08.123
he was just opening his mouth,
and here it goes.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.584
Everything... Everything was easy.

16:27.028 --> 16:29.896
When he was singing
<i>La fille du régiment,</i>

16:29.989 --> 16:32.106
that was the opera that made him famous.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.697
His famous, you know,
nine high C's in <i>La fille du régiment,</i>

16:39.790 --> 16:42.578
<i>La fille du régiment,</i> uh,
that's, you know, opera history.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.683
I felt like I could see his voice.

17:00.770 --> 17:04.059
It was super clear, like a photograph.

17:04.147 --> 17:08.893
You can count molecules practically.
It's so clear.

17:09.487 --> 17:13.321
A tenor singing a high C
makes your ears vibrate.

17:13.616 --> 17:17.656
There's such tension of sound.
My ears would ring.

17:37.181 --> 17:41.221
We all dreamed to be
the most important in the operatic world.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.804
Luciano was the one and only. Yes.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.233
Luciano was singing
in all the theaters,

17:50.319 --> 17:54.689
Covent Garden, Vienna,
La Scala and Metropolitan,

17:55.199 --> 17:57.111
and many other theaters
all around the world.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.823
All his recordings
became quite legendary.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.532
He was labeled by Decca
as the King of the High C's.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.826
The jump of the horse who can jump...

18:07.920 --> 18:11.630
It's not difficult
if he reach the obstacle

18:12.550 --> 18:15.793
at the right moment, in the right balance.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.094
And it's the same singing the top.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.969
Top is not difficult if you arrive there
prepared to make the top.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.620
Can you be absolutely sure that you'll...

18:23.644 --> 18:26.204
If you've prepared properly,
can you be sure you'll hit the note?

18:26.272 --> 18:31.643
No. That is the beauty of my profession.

18:32.111 --> 18:38.073
I always say that, uh,
"voice" in Spanish is feminine.

18:38.159 --> 18:43.200
It's <i>la voz</i>. Also, in Italian, <i>la voce.</i>
In French, <i>la voix.</i>

18:43.289 --> 18:48.375
So, I believe that to live with a voice,

18:48.461 --> 18:52.626
she's like a very, very jealous
and demanding woman.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.383
I know I cannot do anything without her,

18:57.470 --> 18:58.910
without the voice.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.676
You live with it, and you have to realize,

19:01.766 --> 19:03.507
and everything affects it.

19:03.601 --> 19:08.062
Good news, bad news,
something then it is emotional,

19:08.606 --> 19:11.019
physically, we react.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.687
This muscle...

19:13.778 --> 19:16.612
you never know if they respond
to you immediately.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.781
She's the prima donna of my body.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.242
One day's better than another one.

19:24.330 --> 19:29.041
Like in any relationship,
you have to know the person very well

19:29.585 --> 19:34.000
in order to really treat
somebody that you love so much

19:34.090 --> 19:35.456
in the best way.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.632
So, that's the voice, you know.
She's a lady.

21:10.311 --> 21:14.396
The opera is love, hate, death.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.732
It is very important.

21:18.319 --> 21:22.233
With a little makeup,
you can become another person.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.448
The opera is something fake

21:25.534 --> 21:28.572
that, little by little
on the stage, it become true.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.555
I understand you carry,

22:51.579 --> 22:54.572
of all things,
in your pocket, a bent nail.

22:54.665 --> 22:56.452
A bent nail, yes.

22:56.542 --> 23:00.627
It's a superstition,
and all the artists, I think, have one.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.706
Like in English, says, "touch wood,"

23:04.425 --> 23:06.291
in Italy, we say, "touch iron."

23:06.385 --> 23:08.923
And we have a bent nail with iron.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.046
It's double good luck.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.926
Are you a devout Catholic?

23:13.684 --> 23:18.520
I think so, very deeply.
But let's say, then, even being Catholic,

23:18.606 --> 23:20.973
I am still superstitious, just in case.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.715
I think there's no question

23:26.739 --> 23:28.947
Luciano was, at heart, a simple person.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.865
He called himself a peasant.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.739
I think one of the reasons
that the role of Nemorino

23:33.829 --> 23:38.119
in <i>L'elisir d'amore</i> was such a natural fit
is that he was a bit of a bumpkin.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.413
He had
thousands of fans around the world.

24:23.504 --> 24:26.304
People were queuing around the block
for tickets. They'd kill for them.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.930
Somebody from the record company

24:56.954 --> 24:59.742
said to Luciano,
"Well, you... You're such a nice guy...

25:02.001 --> 25:05.870
what you need is a real bastard
to work for you."

25:06.422 --> 25:07.788
That's how we started.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.443
Herbert Breslin had a reputation

25:16.515 --> 25:19.303
as being one of the most hated people
in the opera business.

25:19.393 --> 25:22.761
I had never heard anything good about
Herbert Breslin before I worked for him.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.808
What happened
with Luciano Pavarotti and myself

25:27.901 --> 25:30.564
was a unity of purpose.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.855
He wanted it, and I wanted it.

25:34.575 --> 25:39.491
Because, as his reputation was being made,
my reputation was being made.

25:45.002 --> 25:47.188
Herbert would also tell you
that he generated

25:47.212 --> 25:51.877
a number of the sort of popularizing ideas
that helped make Luciano what he became.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.876
He'd never done a concert before.

25:54.970 --> 25:57.212
He'd never done a recital before.

25:57.306 --> 26:00.674
I opened up the gates of music to him.

26:04.104 --> 26:08.189
My manager sent me out
to Liberty, Missouri

26:08.275 --> 26:10.733
by myself to make a recital.

26:16.450 --> 26:19.284
In opera, you've got the benefit
of a costume and makeup,

26:19.369 --> 26:22.658
and you become another character
during those three hours,

26:22.748 --> 26:24.364
whereas in a recital, you're yourself.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.339
It's only his voice.

26:42.392 --> 26:44.429
You're totally exposed.

26:44.520 --> 26:48.104
You're almost naked because, you know,
you can't hide behind anything.

26:48.482 --> 26:51.850
Luciano said, "Oh, my God,
what am I going to do with my hands?"

26:51.944 --> 26:53.981
His manager said to him,

26:54.071 --> 26:55.937
"Take that handkerchief
that's in your pocket

26:56.031 --> 26:57.192
and hold it in your hands."

27:05.499 --> 27:09.834
My manager said,
"If you don't like it, don't do it."

27:09.920 --> 27:13.504
And I say, "I don't like. I adore it."

27:22.808 --> 27:26.802
We started doing recitals
in rural America.

27:26.895 --> 27:29.729
Places that don't have opera houses.

27:37.156 --> 27:41.070
It's a certain way
to give back what God gave to me.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.868
It's not to make myself popular.

27:43.954 --> 27:46.367
It's to make
the world of the opera popular.

27:48.375 --> 27:52.244
He liked to go
to the buffets in the hotels,

27:52.337 --> 27:54.795
and we would each fill up
two or three times

27:54.882 --> 27:57.295
and pig out on American food.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.797
Mac and cheese and very non-Italian stuff.

28:01.763 --> 28:06.303
What I was able to provide him
was the dynamic of making a star.

28:08.145 --> 28:10.228
<i>Welcome to an historic event:</i>

28:10.314 --> 28:12.556
<i>the first live telecast of an opera</i>

28:12.649 --> 28:15.187
<i>from the new Metropolitan Opera House
in Lincoln Center.</i>

28:15.277 --> 28:18.816
<i>Tonight's opera is</i> La bohème,
<i>"The Bohemians."</i>

28:19.489 --> 28:24.450
Luciano made his debut
at the Met, November of '68,

28:25.037 --> 28:28.326
and it became his artistic home.

28:28.415 --> 28:31.829
So, I think I had
a very close relationship with him

28:31.919 --> 28:33.251
for about 20 years.

28:33.879 --> 28:37.793
I don't think they've ever seen you...
most of them... on television like this.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.842
Well, television like that,
I think it was never made.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.197
It is the first time, is it not?

28:42.221 --> 28:43.448
- Is it not the first time?
- Yes.

28:43.472 --> 28:46.215
- And, uh...
- Have you done television opera in Europe?

28:46.308 --> 28:48.095
- Not live. Uh...
- Okay.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.471
- In studio, yes.
- Uh-huh.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.803
But live, it is the first time.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.889
- It is a new experience for me.
- Uh-huh.

28:53.982 --> 28:58.022
And, uh, don't ask me if I am happy,
because I am never happy, and, uh...

28:58.111 --> 28:59.214
I'll ask you if you're happy.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.298
- Are you happy?
- I am not.

29:00.322 --> 29:01.549
- You're not happy?
- Never. Never happy.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.759
- Never happy? All right.
- Never happy.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.866
I always think I can do better than I do.

29:04.952 --> 29:07.319
He was a nervous wreck
before every performance.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.074
He would always say, "I go to die."

29:10.415 --> 29:11.531
We go to die.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.746
And he would always
end up living after the performance.

29:22.386 --> 29:25.845
You could see the public
was absolutely taking to this man.

29:27.766 --> 29:31.259
Because of his smile,
because of his artistry,

29:31.353 --> 29:34.016
and because of his personality.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.647
They couldn't get enough of him.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.019
Good morning from Chicago,

29:38.110 --> 29:41.148
where I am pleased to introduce
to a very excited audience,

29:41.238 --> 29:42.649
Luciano Pavarotti.

29:45.742 --> 29:48.234
Luciano, you know, loved pasta.

29:48.328 --> 29:51.446
He'd come to our apartment for dinner,
and he'd want to cook.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.949
Garlic, sliced.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.454
- All that?
- Yes.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.957
Going to be fantastic.

29:58.547 --> 29:59.583
Olive oil.

29:59.673 --> 30:01.209
Red pepper.

30:01.508 --> 30:02.589
You're serious now?

30:02.676 --> 30:04.362
- I am very serious.
- All right, all right.

30:04.386 --> 30:05.547
You will cry later, probably.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.253
When you taste.

30:07.347 --> 30:11.967
When he was in New York, he would
always cook this spicy spaghetti for me.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.926
- He didn't like Indian food too much.
- Mmm.

30:14.021 --> 30:17.514
Mr. Pavarotti, on the road,
do you like to have a hotel room with a...

30:17.607 --> 30:19.143
What?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.498
...with a kitchen?
Isn't that right? You...

30:22.946 --> 30:26.360
It's pretty common, I think,
for big international stars

30:26.450 --> 30:27.986
to try to take their home with them,

30:28.076 --> 30:29.783
because you're just always
in a hotel room.

31:03.862 --> 31:08.357
Not being home, not being with his family,
he led a lonely life.

31:08.909 --> 31:12.198
And that's why, I think,
he had the big entourage all the time.

31:12.287 --> 31:15.200
And the after-performances,
all the people going to dinner.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.623
- Can we agree, sir, that it is fattening?
- Hmm.

31:17.709 --> 31:18.770
No doubt about that.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.335
One day, he says,
"Now, this is how you lose weight.

31:22.631 --> 31:26.090
First, we have chicken,
beans and mashed potatoes.

31:26.176 --> 31:30.216
And after that, we then have
four scoops of vanilla ice cream."

31:30.597 --> 31:32.759
And he eats quickly his three scoops,

31:33.350 --> 31:35.888
and he pushes the plate away,
leaving a scoop.

31:36.561 --> 31:40.555
He said, "Now, that's the diet.
You don't eat the last scoop.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.644
I guarantee you, you'll lose weight."

31:42.734 --> 31:43.941
That was his diet.

31:44.945 --> 31:46.982
He absolutely hated being alone.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.564
For somebody who was so big and famous,

31:49.658 --> 31:52.492
he was extremely vulnerable
in so many ways.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.285
He had a lot of nerves,

31:55.372 --> 31:58.536
and I think the audience
could connect with that.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.285
What am I? Am I successful,
or am I just famous?

32:02.379 --> 32:04.086
That, I don't know. I don't care.

32:04.881 --> 32:08.374
I know that people
recognize me on the street. Very good.

32:08.468 --> 32:11.961
But I have three daughters and one wife,

32:12.055 --> 32:14.547
and when I am at home,
I know exactly who I am.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.801
Nothing. Exactly zero.

32:19.688 --> 32:20.724
But I am happy.

32:22.691 --> 32:25.604
<i>Even successful nothings
carry the American Express Card.</i>

32:26.987 --> 32:30.480
The American Express commercial
paid $10,000, which is chicken feed.

32:30.574 --> 32:32.782
But it didn't matter.
It was all over the place.

32:32.868 --> 32:33.949
And do you know me?

32:34.035 --> 32:37.028
Well, if you didn't know me,
you'd know him pretty soon.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.576
Would you welcome, please,
Luciano Pavarotti?

32:39.666 --> 32:41.077
<i>Luciano Pavarotti.</i>

32:41.168 --> 32:43.785
- <i>Luciano Pavarotti.
- Luciano Pavarotti.</i>

32:50.927 --> 32:51.927
Welcome...

32:52.012 --> 32:53.924
to this afternoon's special class

32:54.431 --> 32:57.970
with Mr. Pavarotti and the students
of the Juilliard Voice Department.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.266
Luciano Pavarotti.

33:01.271 --> 33:05.390
Before I met Luciano,
I had no idea who he was.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.020
I should be embarrassed to say that.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.397
I was already
in my second year at Juilliard.

33:10.363 --> 33:12.855
He was doing a master class.

33:13.700 --> 33:14.736
Master class.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.948
The word by itself already scare me.

33:19.039 --> 33:21.656
I am very, very nervous.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.917
It's a daunting experience,

33:25.003 --> 33:28.872
but Luciano was very good
at putting people at ease.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.923
And especially in front of an audience.

33:57.911 --> 34:02.906
He was already a maestro
listening to younger singers

34:02.999 --> 34:07.209
and, you know, knowing the repertoire
and knowing the vocal difficulties

34:07.629 --> 34:11.088
and being able to say something
to make it better.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.460
Wow. Beautiful voice.

34:13.552 --> 34:19.469
I think, for your voice, you should
take the tempo just a little quick.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.139
<i>Un poco più veloce.</i>

34:21.226 --> 34:24.514
Doesn't matter what the piano play,
what the orchestra play,

34:24.603 --> 34:26.561
with the right tempo, for everybody.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.688
Can you try the beginning, please?

34:30.235 --> 34:33.728
I always knew I wanted to sing
from the time I was young,

34:33.822 --> 34:37.907
and I had studied Italian
and lived in France when I was little,

34:37.993 --> 34:39.404
so I had several languages.

34:40.161 --> 34:43.745
Luciano, he needed somebody
to answer his phones

34:43.831 --> 34:45.949
and somebody to answer his fan mail.

34:46.042 --> 34:50.252
He said, "If you help me out,
I will work with your voice."

34:51.089 --> 34:54.172
He loved teaching.
That's what maestro is. He's a teacher.

34:54.259 --> 34:56.420
He had great teachers as a young person,

34:56.511 --> 35:00.721
and he was very, very technically educated
as a tenor student.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.516
When I was a kid,
I gave up everything.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.724
I begin to go to bed early every night.

35:06.813 --> 35:09.772
I try with all my power,
studying the singing,

35:09.858 --> 35:12.350
and become a more serious student.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.234
I'd have two teachers.

35:14.321 --> 35:17.029
One was a tenor,
and he give me vocal ways.

35:17.741 --> 35:20.404
And the second one
is a very, very famous teacher,

35:20.493 --> 35:24.237
and he was more about the phrasing,
the music.

35:24.706 --> 35:29.121
Technique was everything to him.
Technique and language meant so much.

35:29.669 --> 35:36.132
When studying our profession,
Italian opera is the base for opera.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.097
First, we have the words.

35:47.187 --> 35:51.056
The composer, he has the words,
and then he put the notes.

35:51.149 --> 35:54.984
The composers, they are based
on the meaning of the word.

35:55.070 --> 35:58.780
It's the most important
to understand how to...

35:58.865 --> 36:03.360
to share that emotion
from that particular word with the public.

36:16.925 --> 36:21.966
Composers like Mozart, Verdi, Donizetti,
they use the language.

36:22.597 --> 36:26.261
So, if you pronounce it well,
you get the rhythm immediately,

36:26.351 --> 36:28.183
'cause the rhythm is in the music, too.

36:38.738 --> 36:42.448
It's about breathing.
Controlling your diaphragm.

36:42.534 --> 36:46.995
Taking your air in,
and you're the one that decides

36:47.080 --> 36:51.290
where your air goes, how it goes out,
how long your phrase is.

36:51.376 --> 36:53.743
As Luciano used to say...

36:53.837 --> 36:55.373
You measure your breath.

37:06.057 --> 37:09.391
It's how you coordinate
everything with feelings.

37:09.477 --> 37:14.268
With expression, you know?
With temperament. With joy.

37:15.066 --> 37:19.902
The public, they don't know
what are you doing, but they feel it.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.091
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful.

37:43.511 --> 37:46.003
If you just have, singing,

37:46.681 --> 37:50.049
a quarter of the beauty voice
you have speaking, my dear,

37:50.143 --> 37:51.623
you would be yourself a great singer.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.678
- Oh, thank you very much.
- I'm sure.

37:54.147 --> 37:55.875
- Beautiful voice.
- You sly dog, you.

37:59.444 --> 38:02.562
You go right to the ladies, you see?
Right to the ladies.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.988
I saw you before.

38:06.493 --> 38:11.033
Luciano was mischievous.
He had... How would I say? <i>Monello.</i>

38:11.122 --> 38:12.738
That would be the word I would use.

38:12.832 --> 38:16.576
It's an Italian word for,
you know, like a schoolboy sense of humor.

38:16.669 --> 38:21.004
He would take delight in the little
funny things, you know? The stupid things.

38:21.090 --> 38:25.380
Mr. Pavarotti, speaking on behalf
of all the ladies in the audience,

38:25.470 --> 38:29.259
we should like you to know
that we love large men,

38:29.349 --> 38:31.887
and particularly...

38:38.900 --> 38:42.644
Especially large men with large voices.

38:42.737 --> 38:46.321
Do you think
that your huggable extra inches

38:46.407 --> 38:49.241
helps to produce that beautiful resonance?

38:49.327 --> 38:50.534
I think so.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.173
When I was born in this building,

39:12.267 --> 39:15.510
it was already six year
that a boy was not born.

39:16.896 --> 39:20.355
So I was the first boy after six years

39:20.441 --> 39:24.230
born in a house with 15 family,
100 people.

39:24.946 --> 39:29.737
My mother embraced me,
and with all the women of this house,

39:29.826 --> 39:31.613
I was the Lucianino.

39:32.328 --> 39:34.160
Everybody was looking for me.

39:34.956 --> 39:40.327
I was very much spoiled, loved,
but even... kept smart.

39:42.714 --> 39:46.173
I think Luciano loved women.
And he also trusted them.

39:47.176 --> 39:51.671
He was brought up by women.
He had aunties, his mum.

39:52.849 --> 39:55.933
And, of course, with Adua,
he had three daughters.

39:56.561 --> 40:01.181
And then Alice and Nicoletta.
He definitely had an affinity for women.

40:02.066 --> 40:05.059
And I think, the bossier we were,
the more he argued with us,

40:05.153 --> 40:07.315
but the more he trusted us
as well, I think.

40:10.158 --> 40:13.868
I was accompanying him
on all his tours all over the place.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.036
I remember he had 28 suitcases.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.659
You know, Luciano never packed
a suitcase in his life.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.543
He was very demanding.

40:22.629 --> 40:25.838
God forbid his handkerchiefs
weren't where they were supposed to be.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.711
You know, I mean,
it was difficult at times.

40:28.468 --> 40:31.802
I had to take care of his schedule,
who he was supposed to meet,

40:32.639 --> 40:36.053
when his rehearsals were,
and I was singing with him.

40:36.893 --> 40:39.852
The relationship was so all-encompassing

40:39.938 --> 40:44.649
because I was the friend,
the student, the secretary.

40:45.193 --> 40:48.311
He was my mentor,
my teacher, my... my love.

40:49.906 --> 40:55.026
I never thought that I would end up
in a relationship with Luciano.

40:55.954 --> 40:59.493
But it was hard to see
where to draw a line.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.751
I remember a recital, and I was backstage,

41:04.837 --> 41:08.251
you know, holding his water
and his hot tea or whatever,

41:08.341 --> 41:09.902
and all of a sudden, it's like, you know,

41:09.926 --> 41:13.761
he dragged me out on the stage
to sing <i>La bohème,</i> the duet.

41:40.540 --> 41:43.874
Luciano always said
there are no great teachers

41:43.960 --> 41:45.417
or no great students.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.540
It's the meeting of the two, together.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.546
One of the execs in my office

42:25.626 --> 42:27.834
came to me and showed me an article

42:27.920 --> 42:31.504
that the maestro
had just sold out Madison Square Garden.

42:31.591 --> 42:34.129
And I thought,
"Hmm. That looks interesting."

42:34.886 --> 42:39.256
Most of my life at that point
was based around rock and roll concerts.

42:41.559 --> 42:45.929
I had just booked six nights
at Earls Court for Bruce Springsteen

42:46.022 --> 42:47.263
and paid the deposit.

42:47.690 --> 42:49.773
And then I got a phone call

42:49.859 --> 42:51.942
from Bruce's manager to say

42:52.028 --> 42:54.896
that Bruce doesn't want to do
an arena in London.

42:54.989 --> 42:58.448
So I was stuck.
I was in for half a million pounds.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.821
So I set about everybody in my office

43:00.912 --> 43:03.495
looking for an alternative
to put into Earls Court.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.789
And then this chap came into my office

43:05.875 --> 43:09.334
and showed me this article,
and I just said, "Get him."

43:11.589 --> 43:12.705
Herbert Breslin.

43:14.842 --> 43:19.007
So we tracked down
Herbert Breslin, who was his manager,

43:19.097 --> 43:21.555
who refused point-blank to speak to me.

43:23.142 --> 43:29.810
And he said, "Why on earth would I
want to talk to a rock and roll promoter?"

43:29.899 --> 43:32.482
And he kind of emphasized
the "rock" and the "roll."

43:32.568 --> 43:37.359
And I said, "I don't know, really.
I produce concerts. I'm quite good at it."

43:43.913 --> 43:46.155
I kept faxing over offers,

43:46.249 --> 43:51.461
till the point where the offer was so good
that he finally picked the phone up

43:51.546 --> 43:53.538
and he said, "Can we meet?"

43:56.259 --> 44:00.720
So I arranged a lunch in my office.
We sat down, we started talking,

44:00.805 --> 44:05.641
and I realized very early on
that Breslin was a diva.

44:05.726 --> 44:07.137
Was a real diva.

44:07.854 --> 44:10.312
But Pavarotti was different.

44:12.608 --> 44:17.069
The first concert that we put on together,
I took my parents backstage,

44:17.155 --> 44:18.646
and they were so excited to meet him.

44:18.739 --> 44:21.356
And he literally chucked everybody
out of the dressing room.

44:23.911 --> 44:27.370
My mother came out just streaming tears.

44:27.456 --> 44:29.656
And I thought, "Oh, my God,
what's happened?"

44:31.794 --> 44:36.209
He had sat my mum and dad down,
and sang an aria to them.

44:46.392 --> 44:49.305
They told me what happened.
I was quite taken aback, to be honest.

44:50.605 --> 44:56.693
He had this knack above any other person
I'd ever met in my life

44:56.777 --> 44:59.690
of making people feel he was their friend,

45:00.615 --> 45:02.356
that they were special.

45:27.475 --> 45:28.827
What time is it, please?

47:11.579 --> 47:14.196
It was a miracle, no doubt.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.582
From that day, just say, "My dear,

47:17.668 --> 47:20.376
the life is the most important
thing you have.

47:20.963 --> 47:22.374
Let's start again."

47:37.146 --> 47:39.638
About that time, I worked for PolyGram,

47:39.732 --> 47:42.566
which was one of the biggest
record companies in the world.

47:42.651 --> 47:44.813
And we bought Decca Records.

47:45.571 --> 47:47.779
And Pavarotti
was one of their biggest assets.

47:51.327 --> 47:53.239
Almost immediately, we found out

47:53.329 --> 47:55.491
that Pavarotti had been recording
for someone else

47:55.581 --> 47:58.949
while he was under a huge contract
exclusively to Decca.

47:59.043 --> 48:01.410
And I was told to go and tell him off.

48:04.131 --> 48:07.420
I was a nothing little pip-squeak
in the company,

48:07.510 --> 48:10.844
and it was also my first meeting
with the maestro.

48:11.180 --> 48:13.492
So I went to his room at the Savoy
and knocked on the door,

48:13.516 --> 48:15.849
and he said, "Oh, come in. Sit down."

48:15.935 --> 48:17.642
It was obviously quite intimidating.

48:19.688 --> 48:22.055
So I said,
"Maestro, I've come to tell you off."

48:22.149 --> 48:24.436
And he said, "What, what?
Why? What, what?"

48:24.527 --> 48:27.611
I said, "Well, have you been recording
for someone else?"

48:27.696 --> 48:32.066
And he said, "Yes, yes, my wife's company.
I make wonderful records for them."

48:32.410 --> 48:34.151
I said,
"Well, look, you're not allowed to."

48:34.245 --> 48:36.157
He said,
"What do you mean, 'not allowed to?'"

48:36.622 --> 48:39.911
I said,
"Because you are under exclusive contract,

48:40.000 --> 48:43.493
and you are only, only allowed to record

48:43.587 --> 48:45.267
for the Decca record company,
no one else."

48:47.925 --> 48:50.292
"So, this is the meaning of 'exclusive'?"

48:50.386 --> 48:53.879
I said, "Yes, that is exclusive.
Yes, you cannot do it. You must not."

48:55.641 --> 48:57.803
"Ah," he said. "Life is too short."

48:59.019 --> 49:00.260
So I went back to the office,

49:00.354 --> 49:03.062
and they were all desperate to know
what the maestro had said.

49:03.149 --> 49:05.766
"What did he say?" I said,
"Well, he said, 'Life's too short.'"

49:06.277 --> 49:07.813
"What did you say?" I said,

49:07.903 --> 49:10.343
"Well, I couldn't think of anything to say
'cause he's right."

49:11.991 --> 49:14.654
So, we went
and we bought his wife's company

49:14.743 --> 49:15.950
for a modest amount of money,

49:16.036 --> 49:18.278
and he was happy, his wife was happy,
everyone was happy.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.582
It was a life lesson.

49:23.919 --> 49:25.956
Those people that infect you

49:26.046 --> 49:29.414
with understanding the difference
between a business life

49:29.508 --> 49:31.591
and a human life are rare.

49:48.652 --> 49:50.372
During the '80s, he started working

49:50.446 --> 49:54.315
with a Hungarian promoter, Tibor Rudas,
and things just got bigger.

49:57.745 --> 50:02.911
I was the vice president of
the first casino opened in Atlantic City.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.367
I built a theater for them, and I used

50:05.461 --> 50:10.172
practically every contemporary artist
known in the United States.

50:10.799 --> 50:14.793
Sinatra. Diana Ross. Anybody.

50:16.805 --> 50:20.094
It was funny because
the manager was actually Herbert Breslin,

50:20.184 --> 50:21.891
and Herbert wouldn't let you do anything.

50:21.977 --> 50:24.435
And then Tibor Rudas
took him out into the arenas,

50:24.522 --> 50:26.434
and he wanted him to do everything.

50:35.991 --> 50:41.111
Tibor made a career with Luciano,
taking him into stadiums,

50:41.205 --> 50:42.867
various capitals of the world.

50:49.421 --> 50:55.042
Suddenly, in between my relationship
which was just beginning with Breslin,

50:55.135 --> 50:57.718
I get a phone call from Tibor Rudas.

50:57.805 --> 51:01.139
He said, "Anything you do from here on in,
you work for me, got it?"

51:01.225 --> 51:03.387
I said, "Okay."

51:12.069 --> 51:14.937
Once Tibor got in the picture,
the whole financial picture changed.

51:15.948 --> 51:20.033
That was certainly an important point
in the development of Luciano's career.

51:20.119 --> 51:21.655
He was branching out.

51:22.079 --> 51:25.447
Everything became more geared
towards mass appeal.

51:28.419 --> 51:31.253
It's important to remember
that there's a huge tradition

51:31.338 --> 51:35.173
of opera stars
as huge popular entertainers.

51:35.259 --> 51:38.093
The opera stars of their day
were the movie stars of today.

51:38.178 --> 51:40.044
There's an exact link.

51:40.139 --> 51:42.847
And so Pavarotti
is picking up on a tradition

51:42.933 --> 51:45.425
that's very much embodied
by Enrico Caruso, say,

51:45.519 --> 51:49.229
who was the first and one of
the greatest recording stars of all time.

52:02.786 --> 52:08.453
Caruso was this unbelievably,
globally popular tenor

52:08.542 --> 52:11.660
who would attract
hundreds of thousands of people

52:11.754 --> 52:13.916
wherever he went,
just to catch a glimpse of him,

52:14.006 --> 52:15.838
forget about seeing him perform.

52:16.592 --> 52:19.505
Pavarotti was the kind of
Caruso of his age.

52:23.057 --> 52:25.424
And finally this evening, opera in China.

52:25.517 --> 52:30.308
The great Italian tenor, Pavarotti.
ABC's Jim Laurie is in Beijing.

52:30.814 --> 52:34.649
The Western Opera Company
had never been to China.

52:34.735 --> 52:37.819
Enter the imposing figure
of Luciano Pavarotti

52:37.905 --> 52:39.862
in his first tour of China.

52:39.948 --> 52:42.531
Three weeks in which
to embrace the Chinese.

52:43.035 --> 52:46.824
I am very happy to be here.
For all of us, it is completely new.

52:46.914 --> 52:51.375
And I hope especially that the public
is going to enjoy it.

52:52.086 --> 52:54.624
Mao Zedong had departed from the scene

52:54.713 --> 52:57.626
not much before we went to China.

52:57.716 --> 53:03.053
And Luciano took the full opera company,
a press crew and everybody.

53:03.138 --> 53:07.633
The Chinese did not have
a classical music tradition.

53:09.103 --> 53:11.846
It was totally foreign to their culture.

53:24.535 --> 53:28.996
I was a little kid,
and here comes this wonderful Italian guy,

53:29.081 --> 53:32.370
pretty big guy,
but with the most beautiful smile.

53:32.459 --> 53:34.200
I would say, uh, Pavarotti,

53:34.294 --> 53:38.379
when he smiles
with this white handkerchief,

53:38.465 --> 53:39.922
the whole world opens for him.

53:45.597 --> 53:47.884
Pavarotti, before his visit,

53:47.975 --> 53:50.467
we know who he is, but...

53:51.061 --> 53:53.804
we don't know so much about opera.

53:54.690 --> 53:57.899
He certainly gave the Chinese audience

53:57.985 --> 54:02.275
their first inspiration
on how to understand opera.

54:46.116 --> 54:47.652
Huh?

54:51.914 --> 54:55.533
In 1986, in China, I had just turned 30.

54:56.502 --> 54:59.461
Luciano was still married,

54:59.546 --> 55:03.506
and I knew that I had to make a break
from my relationship with Luciano.

55:06.094 --> 55:07.335
So I did make a break.

55:10.474 --> 55:13.433
It was a painful moment for me.
It was a painful moment for him.

55:16.355 --> 55:20.690
I did not speak to Luciano for years
after I went my own way.

55:24.112 --> 55:26.320
At that time, the late 1980s,

55:26.406 --> 55:30.741
Pavarotti is the single most recognizable
operatic figure of the last 50 years.

55:32.621 --> 55:36.114
But, over the course
of the next few years,

55:36.208 --> 55:39.326
Luciano wasn't focused
on the opera anymore.

55:39.419 --> 55:41.272
From my perspective,
it was a picture of somebody

55:41.296 --> 55:43.458
who was a little bewildered, I think.

55:44.299 --> 55:46.211
And had a big monkey on his back,

55:46.301 --> 55:48.588
in terms of a big career
and a lot of responsibilities

55:48.679 --> 55:51.171
and not a lot of clarity
about where he was going with it.

55:53.392 --> 55:55.805
Everything was really very difficult,

55:56.270 --> 56:00.765
but I still have to go on the stage
to act for the night for the public.

56:01.733 --> 56:06.228
I am putting the white makeup
of the clown on the face.

56:07.239 --> 56:12.030
I watch myself in the mirror,
and I say, "It is the life.

56:12.953 --> 56:15.070
You have to go out.

56:15.873 --> 56:20.664
You have to laugh,
even if you have the death in your heart.

56:20.752 --> 56:24.041
You have to try to enjoy
the people like every night."

57:38.205 --> 57:40.447
How can you stay in front of an audience

57:40.540 --> 57:43.283
and say something
if you don't believe in it?

57:45.504 --> 57:49.919
There is no bluff in this profession.
This is not a poker game.

57:50.008 --> 57:51.624
It is a chess game.

57:52.594 --> 57:54.961
And if you lose,
you don't have any excuse.

58:10.529 --> 58:16.196
José was a very young tenor,
and the doctors say that he has leukemia.

58:16.827 --> 58:19.911
And he was one year out of the stage.

58:21.248 --> 58:24.116
<i>José Carreras,
one of the world's most popular singers,</i>

58:24.209 --> 58:27.919
<i>spent ten months undergoing
intensive treatment in Barcelona</i>

58:28.005 --> 58:29.962
<i>and in a specialist clinic in Seattle.</i>

58:30.841 --> 58:34.551
Luciano called me
in my hospital in Seattle.

58:34.636 --> 58:37.219
"Teacher..." He always
called me always "teacher."

58:37.305 --> 58:40.639
"Teacher, how are you doing?
Get well soon.

58:40.726 --> 58:42.467
I don't have competition otherwise."

58:44.604 --> 58:48.564
After that, I had the idea,
maybe we could do a concert

58:48.650 --> 58:51.734
that, uh, puts me back onstage.

58:56.199 --> 59:01.069
In those days, the three of us
used to live in the same building

59:01.163 --> 59:05.703
in Central Park South,
and we had a common friend.

59:06.084 --> 59:08.827
He came to Luciano and me and said,

59:08.920 --> 59:11.663
"What would you feel of doing
a concert with JJosé?"

59:12.424 --> 59:16.464
The idea was that, since all three tenors
really love football

59:16.553 --> 59:19.261
and the World Cup
was going on at the same time,

59:19.347 --> 59:23.466
to get them there at the eve
of the finals, they will all agree.

59:24.561 --> 59:27.349
<i>July in Rome is the scene
of an historic concert.</i>

59:27.439 --> 59:30.523
<i>Three of the world's greatest tenors
on the same stage for the first time:</i>

59:30.609 --> 59:32.976
<i>Luciano Pavarotti, Plácido Domingo</i>

59:33.070 --> 59:35.312
<i>and the recently critically ill
José Carreras.</i>

59:38.700 --> 59:41.067
I feel... It's almost...
The feeling is that, eh?

59:41.161 --> 59:42.161
Yeah.

59:42.245 --> 59:45.579
I thought they will have arguments
who will sing which aria.

59:45.665 --> 59:47.406
There's so much repertoire.

59:48.376 --> 59:51.039
So we all rehearsed it on the spot.

59:58.512 --> 01:00:02.426
One of us suggested,
"Why don't you do this one and I do that?"

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:05.054
And there was no... no... no argument ever.

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:14.938
So, we divide some of the numbers.

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:18.521
So, to pick, you know,
between the saddest and so and so.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.645
I think a good way
to know a person

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.566
is sharing the stage with him.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:59.942
You know what kind of determination,
you know what kind of fears

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:03.365
he's bringing to every performance.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.222
Uh, the moment of being on the stage,

01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:36.103
there was the competition.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:39.186
It was okay, like,
"Anything you do, I can do better."

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:11.760
That feeling was
in the spirit of the moment, you know?

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:15.722
"Boy, what a phrase you did.
Now let me do this one."

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:38.786
It was fantastic in the artistic side,

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.339
but in the personal side,
believe me, it was even better.

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:21.246
We were going to leave Luciano
to sing "Nessun dorma"

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:23.331
because it was his signature aria.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:28.052
But, uh, we end the program,

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:31.427
and we don't have more music,
and we don't know what to do,

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:37.228
and I say to Luciano, "Why we don't do
the 'Nessun dorma' the three together?"

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:40.272
And we did this version,

01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:43.226
which is something
that was, uh, very special.

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:50.312
It's kind of hard
to overstate what an impact that had.

01:05:50.405 --> 01:05:52.317
It was like a tidal wave.

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:04.325
The Three Tenors transformed three guys
into the biggest band in the world.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.860
All of a sudden, classical departments

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:13.046
were the hottest departments
in the record business.

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:22.768
Rudas took on the Three Tenors,
you know, worldwide.

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.345
Also, things catapulted after that.

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.978
By this point,
Breslin was already sidelined.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:34.779
Rudas was the Svengali behind all of it.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:40.487
Pavarotti became the global rock star.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.163
Cut above anybody else.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:52.836
There were a number of times
when he was difficult.

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:55.134
He had his moments, kicking and screaming,

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.031
"I don't want to perform,"
and all the rest of it.

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:00.493
Please, please, please, please, please.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.161
Just make my part.

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:03.185
Okay.

01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:20.485
We'd had a very infamous
kind of hurricane in London,

01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:22.570
where a lot of trees were blown down.

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:25.748
I went to see the Royal Parks Authority

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:29.543
and said, "We would love to do
a concert with Pavarotti."

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:33.293
And I suggested
that we raise a sum of money

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:36.797
towards planting trees to replace
the trees that have been knocked down,

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.405
which, of course, went down brilliantly.

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:39.429
They loved it.

01:07:39.514 --> 01:07:42.348
Luciano Pavarotti,
seen here planting a tree

01:07:42.433 --> 01:07:45.141
for the Prince of Wales'
Royal Parks Tree Appeal.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:48.183
This evening,
the Prince and Princess Diana

01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:51.766
will join an estimated 250,000 people

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:56.229
to celebrate the 30th anniversary
of Pavarotti's professional debut.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:59.941
A lot of the Royal Family came.
Most of the cabinet came.

01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:02.367
So it was a pretty star-studded event.

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:08.616
The day of the concert,
I open the window, and it's raining.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:12.829
And I say to my agent, "Let's go home,"
because nobody's going to come.

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:20.260
It was like somebody was throwing
buckets of water just down from the sky,

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:21.928
and it just never stopped.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.493
Well, we are in England,

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:26.850
so, of course,
it was umbrellas everywhere.

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:33.390
The maestro got to the second aria.

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:36.318
People were holding up their umbrellas.
People behind couldn't see.

01:08:36.404 --> 01:08:39.397
They were shouting,
and there was this noise going on.

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:44.702
I literally rushed onstage,
grabbed the microphone, and I just said...

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:57.582
And the first person to jump up
was Princess Diana,

01:08:57.675 --> 01:09:00.167
who had a guy behind
standing with an umbrella.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:01.572
She said, "Take the umbrella down."

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:04.714
And there was this ripple effect
all the way back through the audience.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.434
Everybody put their umbrellas down,
and the concert carried on.

01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:12.225
The next aria...

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:15.979
the next aria is from the same opera
that I have sung now, <i>Manon.</i>

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:22.148
The title of the aria
is "Donna non vidi mai."

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:25.951
This mean, "I have never seen
a woman like that."

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:28.745
And with your permission,

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:31.536
I would like to dedicate to Lady Diana.

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:23.042
It was something magical,
that connection between the two of them.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.586
Like it was out of a fairy tale.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:56.534
I brought Princess Diana backstage.

01:10:57.879 --> 01:11:01.043
They were kind of giggling,
the pair of them. It was really funny.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.547
The Royal Family, they may attend events,

01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:07.798
but they don't normally
come to dinners afterwards.

01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:11.716
But I invited Princess Diana
to come along,

01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:14.472
and much to everybody's amazement,
she said yes.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:24.103
At dinner, the maestro
sat next to Princess Diana,

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:25.654
and they just hit it off famously.

01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:33.532
They became really, really good friends,

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:35.785
and they both had
a wicked sense of humor as well.

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:38.395
They agreed to do things together,

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:41.503
and subsequently, we did another concert
for the Red Cross.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.862
All of a sudden,
it was less about him as a singer

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:49.003
and more about charity.

01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:55.801
His focus changed.
He was always generous,

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:59.730
but he became completely obsessed
by what he could do for others.

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:06.507
He wouldn't just put money into a charity.

01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:09.774
He wanted to know that it was building
a school or a health center.

01:12:10.701 --> 01:12:12.909
Always around children in the communities.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.325
That goodness resonated out of him.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:18.750
And it's almost like,

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:21.794
"I've reached a stage in my career
where this is what I'm able to do now."

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:29.760
The tears of Luciano Pavarotti.
An emotion never felt onstage before.

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:32.088
But the place where he performed
without a script,

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:36.016
libretto or his big tenor voice
today is an unusual stage:

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:38.344
the center for bone marrow transplant
at Pesaro.

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:43.057
Pavarotti is surrounded by
many children from all over the world,

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:45.563
and here they've ended
a long journey towards hope.

01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:47.653
Here they've managed to defeat
a rare blood disease

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:50.235
with a transplant
that has made the center of Pesaro

01:12:50.324 --> 01:12:51.906
one of the most qualified in the world.

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.701
Pavarotti's visit coincides
with the delivery

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:57.495
of a check for $300,000 to the foundation.

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:02.159
This is the first act of a project
that will be followed by a charity concert

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:04.586
given for Pavarotti International
in Modena.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:10.251
One afternoon, I get a phone call
from Rudas, and he said,

01:13:10.344 --> 01:13:14.008
"So, Pavarotti's gonna have
all you rock people playing with him

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:16.761
in his farm in Modena,
and you're going to pay for it."

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:19.468
Plunk. Hello?

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:25.724
Rudas called back and said,
"He wants to do a concert.

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:29.437
Not my idea. It's your world.
You deal with it. You pay for it."

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:31.522
I said, "What are you talking about?"

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:38.446
We make a charity
with pop singer in Modena.

01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:42.203
I always found myself
very happy to do this thing.

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:46.878
He took ownership
of this one charity concert every year.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:04.471
He would turn up on the day,
not quite sure who was gonna be there.

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.169
And I think
they sometimes didn't know

01:14:07.193 --> 01:14:10.357
who was flying in the night before,
were there any rehearsals.

01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:12.487
And it would never start on time.

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:15.273
But it always had
something magic about it.

01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:18.239
For me, it was very difficult

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:22.824
'cause I can't say pop
and opera singer in the same time.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.408
No. Never.

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:52.273
Luciano wasn't focused
on the opera anymore at that point,

01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:54.049
and there were critics around
who were shocked,

01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:56.156
and the opera world was kind of left cold.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:00.451
I received some criticism
from people then.

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:02.245
Probably they don't understand,

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:06.120
or probably they want to put
a dagger in my body.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:10.045
And, uh, I'm telling you
with all my power, I don't care.

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:14.584
Pavarotti & Friends concerts
every year became,

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:16.669
you know, far more important in his life.

01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:20.135
And after the first time,
Nicoletta came on the scene.

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:28.730
The first day we met
actually was here,

01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:30.102
practically where we are now.

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:36.314
I was very young. I was, like, 23,
and I was studying natural science.

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:40.450
And, uh, like most of the students,
during summertime,

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:43.279
I was always looking
for little jobs around, you know,

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:44.988
to try to pay for school.

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.355
Nicoletta worked at the horse show,

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.541
and she knew nothing about opera.

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:56.278
I don't think
she particularly liked opera,

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:59.466
but the chemistry between them was magical
right from the beginning.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:03.785
Luciano, since the beginning,

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:07.723
told me that the previous relation
was finished, since long time.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:10.684
So I never felt guilty, you know?

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.643
I never felt it to be
the reason of something.

01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:20.031
At the beginning, we told everybody
that I was the assistant.

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:22.780
But, um, that was not true.

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:28.782
It's not easy to say I have a relation
with a man 34 years older.

01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:31.876
The attack was strong.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.214
But Luciano was my great defender,
you know?

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:39.043
He was always protecting me.

01:16:41.138 --> 01:16:43.846
Not much after we were together,

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:46.767
I found out to be sick
of multiple sclerosis.

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:54.767
And that was, uh,
a very difficult moment for us.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:56.861
I realized, I said,

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:59.689
"You know, I don't think
I can be with you anymore."

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:05.072
And he was incredible,
because he said something

01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:07.620
that really brought me tears even now.

01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:08.742
He said, "You know...

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:13.327
until now, I loved you,
but from now on, I adore you."

01:17:20.594 --> 01:17:23.553
"We will be together,
and we will fight the sickness."

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:31.470
And I think this is what love does,
you know... makes you feel better.

01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:37.582
He said, "You know,
you have to watch your sickness now,

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:39.207
like an opportunity.

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:41.631
Not like something bad
that happened to you."

01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:45.377
And I think he got his vision of life
when he was very young.

01:18:47.014 --> 01:18:49.301
After the war, when he was 12 years old,

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:52.429
he had a form of tetanus
from playing outside.

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:54.514
And he almost died.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.358
I was in coma for two weeks.

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:04.108
And I always hear the people
that they come to visit me,

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:06.030
and they say, "Well, the priest arrived."

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:11.657
It was the reason
that I am an optimistic person.

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:15.453
Because, when you come out
from something like that,

01:19:15.542 --> 01:19:18.455
you are definitely a survivor.

01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:27.295
Somebody would just say
to himself in this dramatic moment,

01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:31.177
if I just say,
"I'm going to make it. I will enjoy life.

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:36.262
I will enjoy the sun, the sky,
the tree, everything."

01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:41.441
Luciano said,
"Now, when you see a sunset,

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:43.814
you really feel the sunset inside of you."

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.112
And he was right,

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:53.991
because even the perception
of the important things in life change.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:57.161
You stop making drama for little things,
you know?

01:19:57.251 --> 01:19:59.709
Because, you know that the real drama
is something else.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:03.914
You understand that you need to feel it
and to live it, you know?

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:15.642
Nicoletta is an extremely bright person,

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:17.469
and she just got on with it.

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:20.977
And she became very, very instrumental
in Pavarotti & Friends.

01:20:23.944 --> 01:20:26.152
After the second concert,

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:29.151
Luciano invited a lot of musicians
from the pop world.

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:33.117
But I want to make it bigger, you know?

01:20:33.203 --> 01:20:36.537
So I started from the band
I like most in my life.

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:49.627
Luciano started to call my home in Dublin.

01:20:51.472 --> 01:20:53.680
<i>Hello? I'm Mr. Pavarotti.</i>

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:56.891
You have Luciano Pavarotti,

01:20:56.977 --> 01:20:59.720
the greatest singer on Earth,
maybe who ever existed,

01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:03.102
calling you at home
to try and get us to write a song.

01:21:04.318 --> 01:21:06.355
We called Bono for ages.

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:11.031
He became friend of the housekeeper
of Bono because she was Italian.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:15.151
Our housekeeper, Theresa,
he just got to know her.

01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:18.287
He'd ring and say, "Is God at home?"

01:21:18.916 --> 01:21:21.329
The technique was one of humility,

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:24.745
which is, of course,
a very mischievous trick.

01:21:26.757 --> 01:21:31.001
He had turned our housekeeper
into his consigliere.

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.887
Because, at breakfast, dinner and tea,
she was like,

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:36.680
"Have you got that song done for him?"

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:39.976
Bono said, "I... I don't have a song.
I have no idea."

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:43.555
And Luciano said, "God will inspire you."

01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:48.689
I remember it was Easter coming up,

01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:52.147
and he said,
"Ah, God will sing him something."

01:21:53.033 --> 01:21:54.990
And I woke up with the melody.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:58.490
I mean, it really did happen like that.

01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:02.825
My father put a love of opera in me,
for sure,

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:07.754
so I just imagined it was my father, Bob,

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.082
singing in the shower.

01:22:11.009 --> 01:22:15.174
And then Edge came in,
his father being a tenor also.

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:18.256
And he said, "Yeah,
but he'll want a higher note to hit."

01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:22.390
After we wrote the song
and recorded the song,

01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:26.439
we thought it would be the end of this,
you know, just to give him the song.

01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:28.976
Oh, no, just the start.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:33.905
He then started to petition
our housekeeper, Theresa,

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:37.029
"We need them in Modena.
They now have to play the song."

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:39.236
And I explained,
we definitely couldn't play Modena.

01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:41.729
The band couldn't do it.
We were in the studio at the moment.

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:44.825
And before I could say no,

01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:47.285
he said, "Well, look,
I'm on my way to the studio."

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:52.340
And I said, "No, we're in Dublin."
He says, "I am in Dublin."

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:00.264
So, there's a knock at the door.

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:04.936
He arrives with a fucking... camera crew

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:09.145
to say, "Now you can tell the people
that you're coming."

01:23:10.194 --> 01:23:13.028
How could you say no to that?
You couldn't. He knew that.

01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:15.655
Welcome to Dublin.

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:17.903
- Thank you.
- And this is Brian.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.053
- Brian Eno.
- Hello, Brian.

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:20.263
- Hi. We met.
<i>- Ciao.</i>

01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:22.199
We met already.

01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:25.453
Is it true that,
uh, this song about Sarajevo?

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:33.215
Uh, it's true that, uh, the maestro here
has been haunting me and, uh...

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.758
...he has, like a spirit,

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:40.430
uh, been in this building,
uh, long before he arrived here in person.

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:45.181
And, uh, we made a piece
called "Miss Sarajevo."

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:49.935
We hope to perf...
We will perform this song in Modena on...

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:52.225
- What is the date?
- The 12th of September.

01:23:55.739 --> 01:24:00.609
Luciano is
one of the great emotional arm wrestlers.

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:03.490
And he will break your fucking arm.

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:07.199
And so we ended up in Modena, of course.

I remembered myself
when we were bombed here in the last war.

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:15.684
The gun machine.

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:18.394
The war, the sound of all the night long.

01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:22.899
To see hanged people.

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:24.512
- You saw that?
- Oh, yes.

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:27.654
I don't want to say every day, but almost.

01:25:28.498 --> 01:25:31.161
It was quite something for a kid.

01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:38.377

01:26:09.373 --> 01:26:14.960
He was crushed by injustice,
and the war deeply offended him.

01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:21.925
He just had this sense in him
that he better use this other currency

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.124
and try to do something with it.

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:31.768
He wanted to go to Bosnia
to help the children,

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:35.559
to give them a hope for the future,

01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:38.062
because Luciano was one of those children.

01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:39.858
<i>♪ Is there a time... ♪</i>

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:42.062
We tried to make something,

01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:46.069
a kind of music conservatory
where the kid go there to sing.

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:47.616
It was the most important thing.

01:26:48.078 --> 01:26:51.412
This is for Bosnia.
It's for the kid of Bosnia.

01:26:58.588 --> 01:26:59.588
<i>Grazie.</i>

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:14.803
Bono! Bono! Bono! Bono!
Bono! Bono! Bono!

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:23.353
We went to Barbados
every year, you know, for one month.

01:27:23.447 --> 01:27:24.779
That was our rest.

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:29.408
That moment was really a bad moment

01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:32.532
because, at that point,
the relationship became public.

01:27:39.337 --> 01:27:42.421
In every Italian opera,
there's the <i>scena madre.</i>

01:27:42.507 --> 01:27:46.501
That's the dramatic scene where the hero
comes face-to-face with potential tragedy.

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:50.429
These days in Modena, almost everyone
has something to say

01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:53.929
about Pavarotti's <i>scena madre</i>
and how it will play itself out.

01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:56.352
It's disgusting.

01:27:56.438 --> 01:27:59.681
At the age of 60,
he shouldn't do such things.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.357
Well, he was the most famous Catholic

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:05.152
in the most Catholic of all countries.

01:28:05.238 --> 01:28:07.400
Divorce at that time was unthinkable.

01:28:08.033 --> 01:28:11.492
So they would devote
quite a lot of the paper to it.

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:15.455
In Italy, this story played out for years.

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:17.685
These days,

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:19.075
there are no real marriages.

01:28:19.169 --> 01:28:21.081
Men have four or five wives.

01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:22.412
There is no respect.

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:28.839
So, at the beginning, I spent,
unfortunately, my life trying to show

01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:30.170
that it wasn't like that.

01:28:30.263 --> 01:28:34.132
I should've said, "You are wasting time."
They will still think like that.

01:28:54.287 --> 01:28:56.825
And while Mrs. Pavarotti is in seclusion,

01:28:56.915 --> 01:29:01.455
her lawyer says all the family hopes
is that Luciano tires of it all.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.819
It was bad because,
uh, I was suffering myself.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:15.570
But my wife suffered more.

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:22.118
But they understand that I fell in love.

01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:28.295
He caught it in the neck
for Pavarotti the pop star.

01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:32.466
And now falling in love...
...he caught it in the neck again.

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:35.010
But he was owning up to his humanity.

01:30:35.889 --> 01:30:40.600
The grandiosity of the voice
completely disguised

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:43.473
the fact that he could be
extremely humble.

01:30:44.022 --> 01:30:45.979
And that was a shock to me.

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:48.941
And we ended up becoming great friends.

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:54.147
And then she got pregnant.
I thought, "Wow."

01:30:57.452 --> 01:30:59.535
The incredible thing,
that they were twins.

01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:02.785
So we were so happy, you know?
We had double the happiness.

01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:07.709
We had a very complicated, uh, pregnancy.

01:31:07.796 --> 01:31:11.039
There was, um,
kind of a tumor called molar.

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:15.376
The doctor said, um, in America,
said that I should give up.

01:31:17.347 --> 01:31:19.134
No way.

01:31:19.224 --> 01:31:22.763
So I found a doctor in Italy, said,
"You know, there are just five, um,

01:31:22.852 --> 01:31:24.434
cases like that in the world,

01:31:24.521 --> 01:31:27.229
and they were all... ended badly."

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:30.524
So I said,
"I want to try anyway," you know?

01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:33.318
Eventually, they had twins,

01:31:33.989 --> 01:31:36.231
obviously, and unfortunately,
what happened...

01:31:38.243 --> 01:31:40.986
Riccardo was lost. He was stillborn.

01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:44.705
We lost my son.

01:31:45.583 --> 01:31:47.040
Very sad day.

01:31:48.461 --> 01:31:51.579
But we have Alice, so still a blessing.

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:57.677
All the love that we should have
for both of them is on her.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:02.264
Obviously, it was incredibly difficult
at first. And she was tiny.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:13.984
Right from the start of her life,
you know, she was hanging on.

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:15.070
She was strong.

01:32:49.439 --> 01:32:51.226
I remember his wedding.

01:32:51.316 --> 01:32:55.185
These people from the Emilia region,
they know how to enjoy life.

01:32:55.862 --> 01:32:59.355
The Vatican forbade him
from marrying Nicoletta in a church,

01:32:59.449 --> 01:33:02.066
so, of course, they got married
in the opera house.

01:33:03.036 --> 01:33:04.743
And Alice became his angel.

01:33:14.297 --> 01:33:15.959
- Ah!
- Ah.

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.923
I was filming every little detail.

01:33:21.012 --> 01:33:22.878
Because she was such a joy for us,

01:33:22.972 --> 01:33:25.885
you know, and that we wait
for Alice for such a long time.

01:33:39.239 --> 01:33:41.356
Some month before we had Alice,

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:44.487
Luciano became grandfather
for the first time.

01:33:45.912 --> 01:33:49.030
For him, it was very important
to have the family together.

01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:09.179
Everything that happened
could not be an ending, you know?

01:34:10.061 --> 01:34:11.893
We had to start living again.

01:34:39.299 --> 01:34:42.133
I learned to love people.

01:34:42.218 --> 01:34:44.961
But you cannot, you know, say "learned,"
because you are born

01:34:45.054 --> 01:34:46.866
- with this kind of thing inside you.
- Right.

01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:50.429
But I keep going on
trusting blindly everybody,

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:52.288
- and, uh, most...
- So, even today?

01:34:52.312 --> 01:34:54.165
- Even today. Why?
- You're a trusting person?

01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:56.109
- Are you joking? I will...
- Well...

01:34:56.191 --> 01:34:58.671
I will...
I will not exist if I don't trust people.

01:35:10.455 --> 01:35:12.572
I remember getting
a call from Nicoletta,

01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:15.078
and I went over to see Pavarotti,
and he said,

01:35:15.168 --> 01:35:18.286
"I want to do 40 concerts or thereabouts
around the world.

01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:22.465
Not in a rush.
And I want to open a school.

01:35:23.426 --> 01:35:25.713
And go back to the opera house."

01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:30.013
He said, "You've been with me
for a long time,

01:35:30.099 --> 01:35:31.715
and you never let me down.

01:35:31.809 --> 01:35:33.675
And you're not gonna
let me down now, are you?"

01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:36.558
And I said, "No. It's gonna be fantastic."

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:45.897
Pavarotti, at his best,
he was just a gorgeous, glorious singer.

01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:49.825
He rode on that for a long time,
past his heyday and past his best,

01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:52.073
into roles that weren't so great for him.

01:35:53.081 --> 01:35:56.074
You know, the voice, it was interesting,
but, you know, it just...

01:35:56.167 --> 01:35:58.250
his voice doesn't ping like it used to.

01:35:58.336 --> 01:36:00.953
He made each of his high C's.
He was straining a bit.

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:02.750
He was trying very hard,

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:06.208
but it didn't come out the way he and I
would have liked it to come out.

01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:10.963
I remember somebody saying to me,
"Oh, no, I saw him in the great days.

01:36:11.057 --> 01:36:12.548
It was a whole different thing."

01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:16.143
I just think,
"You don't know anything, do you?

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:17.789
You don't know anything about singing."

01:36:18.147 --> 01:36:24.735
The reason why he is great
is because he has lived those songs,

01:36:24.821 --> 01:36:29.191
and you can hear them
in every crack of his voice.

01:36:31.077 --> 01:36:34.491
You have to break your heart again
and again and again to sing those songs.

01:36:35.206 --> 01:36:38.620
It really pisses me off
when people miss that.

01:36:40.003 --> 01:36:43.872
Because these are well-known songs.
What can you bring to them?

01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:48.209
The only thing you can bring to them
is your entire life.

01:36:49.012 --> 01:36:52.676
A life that's been lived,
the mistakes you've made,

01:36:52.765 --> 01:36:53.972
the hopes, the desires...

01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:59.929
that's... all that stuff
comes crashing into the performance.

01:37:29.302 --> 01:37:32.261
I was conducting <i>Tosca,</i>

01:37:32.347 --> 01:37:36.887
and I will never forget
Luciano singing as the noble character.

01:37:44.233 --> 01:37:45.895
At the end of the opera,

01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:49.478
Cavaradossi,
he knows then he's going to die.

01:38:57.849 --> 01:39:03.186
Bravo!

01:39:22.039 --> 01:39:24.827
Bravo!

01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:44.639
Opera star Luciano Pavarotti
is in the hospital.

01:39:45.354 --> 01:39:48.768
Last year, doctors discovered
he had pancreatic cancer.

01:39:48.858 --> 01:39:51.475
He underwent surgery for it in New York.

01:39:51.569 --> 01:39:54.061
His spokesman says
Pavarotti was taken to the hospital

01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:56.488
in his hometown in Italy two days ago

01:39:56.574 --> 01:39:58.861
but isn't saying anything
about his condition.

01:39:58.951 --> 01:40:00.533
Pavarotti is 71.

01:40:06.459 --> 01:40:08.826
We didn't know,
but he was already sick.

01:40:09.879 --> 01:40:13.668
And I kept crying,
and he was trying really to...

01:40:13.758 --> 01:40:16.045
to tell me that everything will be okay.

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:22.382
Because his frame of mind was like that...
believing... believing in life.

01:41:06.352 --> 01:41:09.186
Giuliana called me
and said her father was in the hospital.

01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:11.685
And then I got on a plane,
and I went to see him.

01:41:12.817 --> 01:41:17.608
The thing that really saddened me
about Luciano was he felt cheated.

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:20.738
He was madder than hell.

01:41:21.492 --> 01:41:23.324
He'd just married Nicoletta,

01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:26.495
and he was leaving her
and their daughter alone.

01:41:30.042 --> 01:41:32.500
Our daughter was very young.
Was four and half.

01:41:32.587 --> 01:41:36.797
And I always ask him,
"Why don't you write something to Alice?"

01:41:37.675 --> 01:41:41.965
And he said, "No,
because if I write something,

01:41:42.054 --> 01:41:43.614
then she will stay with this for her...

01:41:43.639 --> 01:41:46.803
all her life, and she will not
be able to speak to me.

01:41:47.143 --> 01:41:50.352
It's not right. She has to be free.
Completely free, you know?

01:41:50.438 --> 01:41:52.976
I don't want to impose anything, you know?
She must be free."
