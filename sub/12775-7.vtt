- [gasps] Good morning, Josh.
- Morning? It feels more like afternoon.

00:04.855 --> 00:06.789
I've been up since 3:00 a.m.
on a conference call to China,

00:06.794 --> 00:09.279
and now I'm all grumpy... Mmm!

00:10.086 --> 00:11.719
A smoothie.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.678
- Good morning, Josh.
- Mm. Can't talk, Sofia. Smoothie.

00:17.892 --> 00:20.266
Gabi, a package came for
you. It looked important,

00:20.272 --> 00:23.035
so I brought it right over. But
don't worry, I did not open it.

00:23.041 --> 00:24.675
Congratulations!

00:25.035 --> 00:26.261
What?

00:26.267 --> 00:27.743
How would I know? I didn't open it.

00:28.603 --> 00:30.034
[gasps] Oh, my God!

00:30.040 --> 00:33.298
I won the <i>San Francisco Examiner's</i>
Recipe with Relatives contest,

00:33.304 --> 00:35.452
- and there's a...
- Five thousand dollar prize!

00:37.296 --> 00:38.624
I opened it.

00:39.686 --> 00:41.726
"In order to collect the prize
money, you must submit a video

00:41.731 --> 00:43.015
of the two relatives baking together."

00:43.020 --> 00:44.474
Oh well, there goes that. I submitted

00:44.479 --> 00:46.202
Aunt Chris's blueberry
sour cream pie recipe.

00:46.207 --> 00:48.912
- Well, Gabi and her aunt are estranged.
- Nup. I don't want to talk about it.

00:48.917 --> 00:51.927
They haven't talked in like ten years,
and now nobody knows where she is.

00:51.933 --> 00:53.729
Give me her name. I'll
find her in two seconds.

00:53.734 --> 00:54.984
We live in a digital world, Gabi,

00:54.989 --> 00:56.815
and in that world, I'm a god!

00:57.827 --> 01:00.186
I just told you, Josh, I
don't want to talk about it.

01:00.192 --> 01:02.645
As you can see, it's a touchy subject.

01:02.651 --> 01:06.279
And even though $5,000 is
like a million dollars to us,

01:06.285 --> 01:08.674
and it sure would be nice to
be able to afford nice things,

01:08.680 --> 01:10.223
like two-ply toilet paper,

01:10.534 --> 01:12.262
I totally understand
why she doesn't want to

01:12.268 --> 01:13.700
find Chris Zarckaedes, with a "Z."

01:13.706 --> 01:15.977
[gasps] Sofia, what are you doing?

01:15.983 --> 01:18.485
Gabi, it's just so sad.
You guys were so close.

01:18.491 --> 01:21.951
Yeah, until she abandoned my family and
didn't even come to my mom's funeral.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.867
I don't want to see her, I don't
want to talk to her, I don't want to

01:23.872 --> 01:25.461
- find her. [gasps]
- Found her.

01:25.467 --> 01:27.767
Oh, my God. She's alive?
Where is she? I don't care.

01:27.773 --> 01:29.624
Uh... It says there
is a Chris Zarckaedes

01:29.630 --> 01:31.678
who plays on a bowling team
called The Pin Crushers.

01:31.684 --> 01:33.788
Oh, she did like to
bowl, remember, Gabi?

01:33.794 --> 01:37.816
She always used to say, "My mind is
in the gutter, but my balls never are."

01:39.522 --> 01:41.494
Hey, I just got that!

01:43.735 --> 01:46.610
It says The Pin Crushers
play right here in town.

01:46.992 --> 01:49.291
Wait. My aunt's in San Francisco?

01:49.297 --> 01:50.831
I don't care. Where does she play?

01:52.155 --> 01:53.827
- The Alley.
- I don't care.

01:53.833 --> 01:56.653
The one downtown or the one on Third?
You know what? It doesn't matter,

01:56.659 --> 01:59.008
because I don't care.

01:59.455 --> 02:00.995
Then why do you keep
asking so many questions?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.304

03:22.949 --> 03:24.387
Why not?

03:24.393 --> 03:26.238
It's too painful to talk about.

03:27.363 --> 03:29.230
I was a bowling prodigy.

I was 12 years old,

03:31.704 --> 03:34.401

my age, I was scouted to go pro.

It was the state finals.

08:15.814 --> 08:18.623
He was a loser kid that sucked
at everything but bowling

Okay. I'm gonna go
talk to him. I'm ready.

I get it. You know, you're freaking
out because your aunt is now your uncle.

No, no. I am surprised that
my aunt is now my uncle,

08:37.613 --> 08:40.207
but I'm freaking out because
before my aunt was my uncle,

08:40.214 --> 08:42.352
she completely abandoned our family,

08:42.359 --> 08:44.635
and I always had this fantasy
that if I ever saw her again,

08:44.640 --> 08:47.055
I would hug her or I would
punch her or I would do both,

08:47.061 --> 08:50.085
but now, I am so confused,
I don't know what to do.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.579
Well, what's your
heart telling you to do?

go over there and talk to him

08:55.094 --> 08:57.173
and connect with him
and tell him who I am.

08:57.179 --> 08:59.080
- Then do it.
- Okay.

09:53.435 --> 09:56.729
Straight flush. King high,

09:56.960 --> 09:59.491
or as I like to call it, "King, hey!"

10:00.677 --> 10:02.399
Oh, my God, my ring!

10:02.405 --> 10:03.832
You mean, my ring?

10:04.216 --> 10:06.619
Look, Yolanda, I can't lose my ring.

10:06.625 --> 10:08.604
Alan will kill me.

10:08.610 --> 10:11.886
Aw, as wonderful as that might sound...

10:11.892 --> 10:13.831
[singsongy] you're not getting it back.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.108
Yolanda, please. I'll do anything.

10:16.114 --> 10:18.020
Fine. I'll give it back to you,

10:18.026 --> 10:21.415
if you do all my work for one week.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.811
You mean drink scotch
and pretend to vacuum?

10:23.817 --> 10:25.250
Done!

10:29.183 --> 10:30.462
Hi, I'm back.

10:31.159 --> 10:32.464
I see that.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.646
Don't you want to know why I'm back?

10:35.582 --> 10:38.210
Not really. Like I said, we're
in the middle of practice.

10:38.216 --> 10:39.801
Okay, got it. I'll talk fast.

10:40.215 --> 10:43.454
My name's Gabi Diamond,
my mom's name is Sarah.

10:46.053 --> 10:48.843
Well, I grew up in Florida,
and moved to San Francisco

10:48.849 --> 10:50.381
to pursue my dream of being a chef,

10:50.387 --> 10:53.939
which was inspired in part by
baking with my aunt as a child.

10:56.244 --> 11:00.189
So much so that I entered her
blueberry sour cream pie recipe

11:00.195 --> 11:04.465
in a contest and won $5,000, which I
would really like to share with my aunt

11:04.471 --> 11:06.550
if you would just tell
me that you are him.

11:06.556 --> 11:08.246
Excuse me, my buddies
are waiting for me.

11:08.252 --> 11:11.454
Cool, cool, cool. So,
here's the thing...

11:11.460 --> 11:14.911
I saw your tattoo...
your "Cutie Pie" tattoo?

11:15.108 --> 11:17.545
I was with you when you got it, and I
don't mean to make you uncomfortable,

11:17.550 --> 11:20.123
but I was so angry at you,
and now that I've seen you,

11:20.129 --> 11:22.063
I just miss you. Don't you miss me too?

11:22.351 --> 11:24.065
What I'm missing is my turn.

11:24.071 --> 11:25.751
You can't take your
turn without your ball.

11:26.273 --> 11:27.517
Are you serious?

11:27.523 --> 11:29.690
- Just tell me you're my aunt.
- [sighs] Give me my ball.

11:29.695 --> 11:31.192
- Tell me you're my aunt.
- Give me my ball.

11:31.197 --> 11:33.264
- Tell me you're my aunt!
- I'm your aunt!

11:34.397 --> 11:35.859
They don't know?

11:36.042 --> 11:37.945
That there's ants!

11:37.951 --> 11:39.885
Ants, ants, everywhere! [gasps]

11:39.891 --> 11:41.646
Oh, my God, they're on the ball! Eww!

11:41.652 --> 11:43.943
- Aah! Aah! Aah!
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

11:43.949 --> 11:45.726
I'm so sorry, Uncle Chris.

11:45.732 --> 11:47.998
Did you hear that? Uncle Chris!

11:53.602 --> 11:56.041
Oh, Gabi, don't look so down.

11:56.047 --> 11:59.806
Why not? I ruined the one chance
I had to reconnect with my uncle.

11:59.812 --> 12:02.753
And then I dropped a bowling ball
on his foot and I broke his toe.

12:03.994 --> 12:05.568
I made a mess of everything.

12:05.574 --> 12:06.981
[knocking]

12:06.987 --> 12:08.630
Not everything.

12:08.636 --> 12:12.235
Oh, my God! You contacted Uncle Chris
and you told him how horrible I felt

12:12.241 --> 12:14.322
and now he's here to
patch things up with me.

12:15.603 --> 12:16.933
Not quite.

12:17.727 --> 12:21.598
But Lil' So-So don't let go of
five Gs without getting some backup.

12:22.938 --> 12:27.109
We may not have your
aunt, but we have an aunt.

12:27.529 --> 12:32.131
Meet Sigourney Simone,
regional theater actress.

12:32.137 --> 12:35.344
My headshot and... [rolls "R"] résumé.

12:36.688 --> 12:39.975
Really, Sofia? You think we can
just hire someone to play my aunt?

12:39.981 --> 12:44.497
Not just someone. You're talking to the
thespian who recently played the role of

12:44.503 --> 12:47.957
"Confused Older Woman"
in a Life Alarm ad.

12:48.894 --> 12:53.665
My line was, "I've fallen,
and I can't remember my name."

12:54.717 --> 12:57.188
I'm sorry. It was last
minute, on Craigslist.

12:57.929 --> 13:02.347
So, what can you tell me
about the role of Aunt Chris?

13:02.353 --> 13:04.460
Well, first of all, I don't do this.

13:05.581 --> 13:07.361
You're Aunt Chris?

13:07.691 --> 13:09.762
This could be my greatest role yet!

13:10.899 --> 13:12.518
Well, thank you so much, Sigourney.

13:12.524 --> 13:14.125
W-we'll have our
people call your people.

13:14.131 --> 13:17.115
Oh, if my manager sounds like
me, don't let it confuse you.

13:19.092 --> 13:23.150
Okay. Uh... So, I'm gonna take down
that ad and give you two some privacy.

13:24.614 --> 13:26.427
Uncle Chris, what are you doing here?

13:26.846 --> 13:29.414
I didn't like the way
things ended between us.

13:29.420 --> 13:32.352
You know, with me spending four
hours at urgent care and all.

13:32.358 --> 13:34.507
I'm so sorry about your foot,

13:34.513 --> 13:39.493
but after I almost outed you, I
guess I was just trying to "in" you.

13:40.538 --> 13:43.350
And I'm sorry, but after 10
years, I had a lot to say.

13:43.357 --> 13:45.358
- I get it.
- Do you?

13:45.364 --> 13:47.965
Yeah. I left without saying goodbye,

13:47.971 --> 13:49.420
and you're mad about it.

13:49.426 --> 13:50.809
Mad? [laughs]

13:50.815 --> 13:52.129
Yeah, yeah, I'm mad.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.319
I mean, I get that you wanted to
move away and start a new life,

13:54.324 --> 13:56.085
but you didn't have to cut me out of it!

13:56.091 --> 13:57.943
My mom was sick and you
disappeared from her life.

13:57.948 --> 14:00.925
And you didn't even come to her funeral.
How could you not come to her funeral?

14:00.930 --> 14:02.555
I was there.

14:02.703 --> 14:05.037
No, you weren't. I
looked all over for you.

14:05.043 --> 14:06.924
Really? We're you looking for this?

14:09.836 --> 14:11.236
Good point.

14:12.891 --> 14:14.465
I sat in the back.

14:14.471 --> 14:16.708
Had I come as the new me,

14:16.714 --> 14:19.466
we would have had another funeral
the next day for your grandfather.

14:21.296 --> 14:22.786
Believe me,

14:22.969 --> 14:25.768
I wish I had spent more time with
your mom before she passed away.

14:25.775 --> 14:27.504
I regret it every day.

14:28.654 --> 14:30.121
You look so much like her.

14:30.127 --> 14:31.494
Oh, thanks.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.138
You don't.

14:39.525 --> 14:41.589
You know how many times that
I've looked you up on Facebook?

14:41.593 --> 14:43.650
How many times I've almost
knocked at your door?

14:43.656 --> 14:45.454
- Well, why didn't you?
- [sighs]

14:45.460 --> 14:47.066
Because it was hard.

14:47.072 --> 14:48.494
This whole thing...

14:48.500 --> 14:50.840
You think it's easy to just tell people?

14:50.847 --> 14:53.141
It changes the way they
look at you forever.

14:53.146 --> 14:54.632
Not me.

14:54.759 --> 14:57.348
Yeah, right. Like you haven't been
sitting here, trying to picture me

14:57.353 --> 14:59.482
without this beard the
whole time I've been here.

14:59.860 --> 15:02.139
I think you look really
good with a beard.

15:04.307 --> 15:05.899
I take after Grandma!

15:09.301 --> 15:12.081
- I missed you, Gabi.
- I missed you, Uncle Chris.

15:16.005 --> 15:18.303
And I'm very sorry about your toe.

15:18.748 --> 15:21.976
I forgive you, but my
teammates aren't gonna.

15:21.982 --> 15:23.467
The Pin Crushers are
gonna have to forfeit the

15:23.472 --> 15:24.851
tournament tomorrow without me.

15:24.857 --> 15:27.500
(Sofia) Not if you agree to
do the video for the contest!

15:28.427 --> 15:30.994
We happen to know an amazing bowler!

15:31.000 --> 15:33.079
You haven't changed a bit, Sofia.

15:34.085 --> 15:35.590
(Sofia) You have!

15:41.257 --> 15:42.969
[singsongy] Josh!

15:42.975 --> 15:44.672
Guess what time it is.

15:44.678 --> 15:47.859
Smoothie o'clock for the
best bowler in San Francisco.

15:47.865 --> 15:49.470
Why did you say bowler?

15:49.834 --> 15:51.509
Because I really need you.

15:51.796 --> 15:53.177
The answer is no.

15:53.183 --> 15:54.898
And there's nothing you can
say that's gonna make me feel...

15:54.903 --> 15:57.215
Gabi. Look, you don't understand.

15:57.381 --> 15:59.172
Okay, I know this might
sound silly to you,

15:59.178 --> 16:02.739
but that day I lost in the state finals
was one of the worst days of my life.

16:02.745 --> 16:05.488
Before that, I was this fun,
outgoing kid. And when I lost,

16:05.494 --> 16:07.550
I became so insecure, I
just locked myself in my room

16:07.555 --> 16:09.159
and played on my computer all day.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.869
Yeah, and look how well
that turned out for you.

16:12.522 --> 16:13.799
What are you talking about?

16:13.805 --> 16:16.832
Josh, look around!

16:16.838 --> 16:18.758
You're a huge, successful millionaire!

16:18.764 --> 16:22.107
Okay? And... and do you ever think maybe
if you were happy and secure back then,

16:22.113 --> 16:23.661
you would have all of this?

16:23.667 --> 16:28.007
And a personal chef who's willing to
make you a smoothie night or day...

16:28.228 --> 16:30.320
and is a friend who really needs you.

16:30.682 --> 16:31.882
[sighs]

16:36.077 --> 16:37.944
[hoarsely] Smoothie.

16:40.115 --> 16:41.881
Missed a spot.

16:42.883 --> 16:44.684
[knocking on door]

16:46.095 --> 16:48.661
- I'll get it.
- I know!

16:53.628 --> 16:55.275
Hey, Sweetie. Ready for lunch?

16:55.281 --> 16:56.902
I'll be right out.

16:59.291 --> 17:03.163
Yolanda, can I borrow
my ring, just for lunch?

17:04.163 --> 17:05.768
I would...

17:06.175 --> 17:07.713
but I don't wanna!

17:09.602 --> 17:11.770
Fine. I'll be back in an hour.

17:14.277 --> 17:16.374
Thanks for pressing the button for me.

17:16.380 --> 17:19.983
My hands are so tired
from... hand stuff.

17:21.330 --> 17:24.226
Since when do your hands
get tired from hand stuff?

17:26.619 --> 17:28.998
I knew it! You're not
wearing your wedding ring!

17:29.004 --> 17:31.740
- I can explain.
- You don't have to. I know why.

17:31.942 --> 17:33.629
- You do?
- That cheap

17:33.635 --> 17:35.883
fake ring turned your finger green.

17:37.113 --> 17:38.974
Let me explain.

17:39.076 --> 17:42.193
When you went swimming in Hawaii
and asked me to hold onto your ring,

17:42.199 --> 17:46.197
I was so distracted by the different
blintz toppings at the buffet,

17:46.203 --> 17:47.530
I lost it.

17:47.535 --> 17:50.140
And I didn't have enough
money to replace it, so...

17:50.146 --> 17:53.346
I got you a cheap
knockoff. I'm so sorry.

17:54.053 --> 17:55.433
You know what, honey?

17:56.068 --> 18:00.203
It's gonna take a while, but
eventually I'll forgive you.

18:01.396 --> 18:03.748
I'm glad you told me the truth.

18:03.754 --> 18:06.386
- [elevator dings]
- Me too. The lies were killing me.

18:06.392 --> 18:09.548
It's really true what they say:
the truth will set you free.

18:09.554 --> 18:11.314
You have no idea.

18:16.968 --> 18:20.427
So, where's the famous bowler
you said could fill in for me?

18:20.433 --> 18:23.634
Ah, he's coming. I
hope. I used my charm.

18:23.640 --> 18:24.974
Uh-oh.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.977
[gasps] He's here.

18:29.791 --> 18:33.224
The King of the Turkeys... is back!

18:33.230 --> 18:35.239
You faced your fears, Gabi.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.836
Maybe it's time I faced mine.

18:38.343 --> 18:40.265
Maybe it's time you
stopped talking like Batman.

18:40.648 --> 18:42.647
Sorry, I can't hear you.

18:43.374 --> 18:44.939
Destiny's calling.

18:46.103 --> 18:47.947
- [pins clattering]
- [cheering]

18:47.953 --> 18:50.721
- Wait. What's happening?
- Well, now we're down by a strike.

18:50.727 --> 18:53.017
Which is kind of ironic 'cause that's
what we were down by in the state finals

18:53.022 --> 18:55.850
when I totally blew it, but I'm not
thinking about that. [laughs nervously]

18:56.828 --> 18:58.684
I know you can do it, Josh!

18:58.922 --> 19:00.417
I don't know if he can do it.

19:05.792 --> 19:07.245
Here we are, old friend.

19:08.307 --> 19:09.933
[whispered] Not too many
people get a second shot,

19:09.938 --> 19:11.525
but here we are, we got one.

19:11.531 --> 19:13.167
Roll strong.

19:13.767 --> 19:15.101
Roll true.

19:15.107 --> 19:17.304
Why is that fool talking to his ball?

19:17.591 --> 19:19.859
He's not gonna do something
freaky with it, is he?

19:21.219 --> 19:24.195
I don't know. He did
take it into the bathroom.

19:39.726 --> 19:43.699
- Yes! We won! We won!
- We won! We won!

19:45.164 --> 19:46.757
Thank you, Cutie Pie.

19:46.763 --> 19:48.664
Any time, Uncle Chris.

19:50.659 --> 19:52.654
You were amazing!

19:53.192 --> 19:56.084
Finally, redemption.

19:56.090 --> 19:58.432
Really? I thought after
you faced your fears,

19:58.438 --> 20:00.679
you were gonna stop talking
like that. No, it's fine!

20:05.933 --> 20:09.066
A two hour lunch. What
the hell were you thinking?

20:09.072 --> 20:11.130
But, you don't have time to answer that.

20:11.136 --> 20:13.262
Just get this place in shipshape.

20:13.268 --> 20:14.668
Josh is on his way home.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.605
Yolanda!

20:20.988 --> 20:22.589
You want this ring?

20:22.595 --> 20:24.897
You best make that vacuum sing.

20:26.174 --> 20:27.963
I've got one for you.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.942
Kiss my ass, that ring is brass.

20:31.448 --> 20:32.801
Say what?

20:33.064 --> 20:34.683
Turns out,

20:34.689 --> 20:37.638
Alan lost the real one in Hawaii.

20:37.644 --> 20:40.368
Oh-ho-ho! Oh-ho-ho!

20:44.459 --> 20:46.226
Happy cleaning, bitch.
