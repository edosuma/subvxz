01:12.871 --> 01:14.806
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

01:14.906 --> 01:17.826
<i>1870 to be exact,</i>

01:17.926 --> 01:19.677
<i>a 16-year-old kid</i>

01:19.777 --> 01:22.580
<i>traveled from the cold shoulder
of Scotland</i>

01:22.680 --> 01:26.785
<i>to the baking heart of America
to find his love.</i>

01:26.885 --> 01:29.388
<i>His name was Jay.</i>

01:29.721 --> 01:32.057
<i>Her name was Rose.</i>

01:37.162 --> 01:39.197
Pegasus...

01:40.098 --> 01:42.167
The Great Bear...

01:43.268 --> 01:45.303
The Dragon...

01:46.804 --> 01:48.718
Andromeda...

02:03.488 --> 02:05.557
Orion's belt.

05:03.835 --> 05:05.770
<i>I was drifting West</i>

05:05.870 --> 05:07.872
<i>when I picked up his trail</i>

05:07.972 --> 05:10.842
<i>deep in Colorado territory.</i>

05:11.542 --> 05:15.513
<i>A jackrabbit in a den of wolves.</i>

05:16.147 --> 05:18.750
<i>Fortunate to be alive.</i>

06:24.215 --> 06:26.819
Arms abroad, boy.

06:27.452 --> 06:29.120
Red skin or white?

06:30.393 --> 06:34.626
Sir... I'm British... Scottish.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.729
Catch the savage.

06:49.874 --> 06:52.577
I'm Jay Cavendish...

06:52.677 --> 06:55.346
son of Lady Cavendish.

06:55.446 --> 06:58.583
We're all sons of bitches.

07:05.356 --> 07:07.474
Grave play, boy.

07:09.594 --> 07:11.731
Sir... lower your pistol.

07:25.510 --> 07:27.345
Hey.

07:42.347 --> 07:43.953
Clean it, oil it.

07:57.642 --> 07:59.677
What do you want?

08:08.453 --> 08:10.598
He was an officer.

08:11.155 --> 08:14.058
Wearing a dress don't make her a lady.

08:19.230 --> 08:21.432
They ain't soldier.

08:21.799 --> 08:23.339
Least no more.

08:24.369 --> 08:26.600
Injun slayers.

08:32.309 --> 08:35.447
Keep headin' West solo,
you'll be dead by dawn.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.615
How you made it this far is a miracle.

08:38.015 --> 08:40.586
- I take care of myself.
- Sure, kid.

08:41.385 --> 08:44.834
You need chaperoning,
and I'm a chaperone.

08:51.195 --> 08:53.706
- Safer to travel with a killer?
- That's right.

08:54.365 --> 08:57.327
First let's save your pony's life.

09:00.471 --> 09:04.442
Counted a dozen of them bastards
attacked those Indians back there.

09:04.742 --> 09:06.511
Minus three...

09:06.611 --> 09:08.980
that leaves too many.

09:28.232 --> 09:30.501
"Ho for the West...

09:30.601 --> 09:32.737
A Traveler and Emigrant's Handbook...

09:32.837 --> 09:35.406
to Canada and the North West
States of America"

09:35.506 --> 09:37.241
by Edward Hepple Hall.

09:37.341 --> 09:39.644
Well, ho for the West.

09:41.379 --> 09:44.650
Dollars... fifty now,
fifty when we split.

09:57.061 --> 10:00.264
Until we reach a forest
called Silver Ghost.

10:06.137 --> 10:08.239
Let's drift.

10:36.734 --> 10:40.538
- What's your name?
- Drop back. Single file.

10:51.616 --> 10:52.971
Why are you headin' West?

10:59.357 --> 11:02.093
You care not why I'm headed West?

11:02.793 --> 11:04.328
There was an accident.

11:04.428 --> 11:07.632
My girl and her father
fled from Scotland...

11:07.732 --> 11:09.734
settled out West.

11:09.834 --> 11:12.136
It was all my fault.

11:12.803 --> 11:14.533
Take a hint, kid?

11:15.906 --> 11:19.477
- We love each other.
- Sure you do, kid.

11:25.182 --> 11:26.818
Jay!

11:27.218 --> 11:31.124
A thousand ways to die... choose one.

11:34.625 --> 11:37.161
Bow and arrow.

12:17.034 --> 12:19.170
Silly boy.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.507
My turn.

13:48.425 --> 13:50.795
<i>That kid was a wonder.</i>

13:52.329 --> 13:54.463
<i>He saw things differently.</i>

13:55.266 --> 13:59.770
<i>To him, we were in a land
of hope and good will.</i>

14:03.274 --> 14:05.609
<i>The way I saw it...</i>

14:05.776 --> 14:08.946
<i>kick over any rock
and most likely a desperado</i>

14:09.046 --> 14:13.551
<i>will crawl out and knife you right
in the heart if there was a dollar in it.</i>

14:54.658 --> 14:58.162
Same stars, same moon...

15:00.564 --> 15:03.634
One day we'll be wanderin'
'round that moon.

15:04.435 --> 15:06.751
They'll build a railroad.

15:06.851 --> 15:09.907
A railroad up and down the ways.

15:14.645 --> 15:17.342
A railroad to the moon.

15:18.349 --> 15:20.851
And when we get there...

15:21.352 --> 15:23.354
the first thing we'll do...

15:23.454 --> 15:26.056
is hunt the natives down.

15:27.157 --> 15:29.260
No Indians on the moon.

15:34.131 --> 15:38.313
No, the natives of the moon.
The moon people.

15:51.615 --> 15:53.684
Pegasus...

15:55.286 --> 15:57.521
The Great Bear...

15:59.190 --> 16:01.017
The Dragon...

16:13.604 --> 16:15.606
Sit down.

16:46.136 --> 16:49.374
This is the last time
I'm gonna clean up your shit.

17:45.429 --> 17:48.766
It must have been winter
when Rose passed through here.

17:48.866 --> 17:50.401
What's she like?

17:52.469 --> 17:54.695
She's a beauty.

17:55.873 --> 17:58.175
And she does not waste words.

17:58.275 --> 18:01.394
They tumble out... wit following wisdom.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.950
You haven't bedded her, have you?

18:08.385 --> 18:10.621
Grab that end.

18:11.422 --> 18:12.489
You're a brute.

18:33.844 --> 18:36.346
Trading post up ahead.

18:36.447 --> 18:39.950
We can dine at a table
while sittin' on a chair.

19:08.846 --> 19:11.415
Tie the horses 'round back.

19:23.861 --> 19:26.096
<i>Everyone knew about the bounty...</i>

19:26.196 --> 19:28.266
<i>except Jay.</i>

19:31.401 --> 19:33.540
<i>He was leading me right to it.</i>

19:52.656 --> 19:55.159
<i>There were few of us left.</i>

19:55.259 --> 19:57.728
<i>Men beyond the law.</i>

19:59.897 --> 20:03.367
<i>But the most dangerous
are the last to fall.</i>

20:07.337 --> 20:11.709
May I ask you to place your iron
on the counter while you browse?

20:19.383 --> 20:21.585
We'll be dining.

20:31.161 --> 20:34.932
- May I try on a suit?
- Sure, be my guest.

20:50.547 --> 20:52.416
Whiskey?

20:54.217 --> 20:57.321
- Got any meat?
- I got condemned bacon.

20:57.421 --> 21:01.358
Traded it for bullets.
Both'll kill you pretty quick.

21:50.707 --> 21:53.477
Blanket, please.

21:53.577 --> 21:55.804
Blanket, huh?

21:58.982 --> 22:03.854
Ma'am, you have to purchase items
'fore baggin' 'em.

22:04.488 --> 22:07.324
How we do it here in America.

22:09.493 --> 22:11.361
Johan.

22:18.135 --> 22:19.970
Sorry.

22:20.070 --> 22:22.156
Money... please.

22:22.639 --> 22:25.168
Well, now, looky here.

22:25.268 --> 22:26.943
You realize if I give you money,

22:27.043 --> 22:29.231
here's the only place around
where you can spend it.

22:30.781 --> 22:32.550
Johan!

22:34.584 --> 22:36.445
Money...

22:49.900 --> 22:53.284
Johan... Johan!

23:00.244 --> 23:01.277
Breathe.

23:05.482 --> 23:07.284
Breathe.

23:08.352 --> 23:10.220
In...

23:10.320 --> 23:12.356
and out.

23:14.324 --> 23:15.645
Money.

23:20.597 --> 23:22.035
Money!

23:23.066 --> 23:24.602
Breathe.

23:25.202 --> 23:27.104
In...

23:27.404 --> 23:28.438
and out.

23:28.538 --> 23:30.240
Money!

23:30.707 --> 23:32.376
Breathe.

23:36.446 --> 23:38.448
Money!

23:38.548 --> 23:40.484
In...

23:41.184 --> 23:42.855
- and out.
- Money!

23:56.500 --> 23:58.769
Grab some provisions.

23:59.202 --> 24:01.071
Jay!

24:29.533 --> 24:30.901
Shit.

24:58.929 --> 25:01.431
Dry your eyes, kid, let's drift.

25:52.382 --> 25:55.159
We could have taken them in.

25:56.386 --> 25:58.155
In where?

26:24.247 --> 26:26.416
How do you feel...

26:27.484 --> 26:29.486
about me?

26:35.158 --> 26:38.128
You're the little brother I never had.

26:43.733 --> 26:46.003
You don't mean that.

26:47.637 --> 26:50.173
That's not what you mean.

26:56.313 --> 26:58.949
I'm sorry, my Romeo...

26:59.749 --> 27:02.418
but "these violent delights...

27:02.518 --> 27:04.358
have violent ends."

27:04.458 --> 27:06.723
What choice do you have?

27:06.823 --> 27:10.627
A farmer... a fisherman...

27:12.429 --> 27:14.867
Best you leave now, Jay.

27:19.435 --> 27:21.505
- Under the bed.
- No.

27:25.378 --> 27:28.144
- Daddy.
- Rose.

27:32.616 --> 27:34.749
Growin' up quick.

27:36.086 --> 27:40.724
- John, Calum, Rose.
- Willie, Angus.

28:21.431 --> 28:24.034
Lord Cavendish, can I help you?

28:24.134 --> 28:26.770
I've come for my nephew.

28:31.174 --> 28:34.845
You should not be in here.
These people are peasants.

28:49.793 --> 28:52.128
I'm with Rose now.

30:50.914 --> 30:52.849
I come in peace.

30:54.918 --> 30:58.688
My ears hear your music.

30:58.788 --> 31:00.690
Come. Come.

31:00.790 --> 31:02.859
Come! Come!

31:22.812 --> 31:24.647
Sit.

31:25.715 --> 31:27.450
I have coffee.

31:33.890 --> 31:35.825
You a writer?

31:36.022 --> 31:38.261
Perhaps.

31:39.929 --> 31:44.901
I am "Recording the Decline
of the Aboriginal Tribes...

31:45.601 --> 31:48.288
Their Customs, Culture and Habits...

31:48.388 --> 31:51.675
In the Hope of Preventing
Their Extinction

31:51.975 --> 31:56.112
or Conversion to Christianity."

31:56.212 --> 31:59.741
The title of my account.

32:00.950 --> 32:04.239
- Too long?
- Perhaps.

32:07.056 --> 32:09.659
So, now.

32:09.759 --> 32:11.367
East. What news?

32:13.229 --> 32:14.998
Violence and suffering.

32:17.533 --> 32:18.692
And West?

32:20.370 --> 32:22.472
Dreams...

32:23.073 --> 32:25.375
and toil.

32:25.842 --> 32:28.645
I passed through burnt remains
of an Indian camp.

32:31.547 --> 32:34.417
This is dreadful news.

32:37.654 --> 32:39.856
A race extinct...

32:39.956 --> 32:41.825
their culture banished,

32:41.925 --> 32:44.060
their places re-named,

32:44.160 --> 32:47.380
only then will they be viewed
with selective nostalgia,

32:47.480 --> 32:51.867
mythologized and romanticized
in the safe guise of art...

32:51.967 --> 32:54.771
and literature.

32:56.639 --> 33:00.109
This is a new world for us...

33:00.910 --> 33:03.112
also for them.

33:08.251 --> 33:10.753
You must be hungry.

33:13.156 --> 33:17.227
'Til now, my sole company's
been a brute.

33:18.194 --> 33:20.563
Sorry to hear this.

33:21.197 --> 33:23.266
I escaped.

33:24.067 --> 33:25.935
Thank you.

33:39.349 --> 33:41.951
I killed a woman yesterday.

33:43.987 --> 33:46.089
Part and parcel.

33:47.623 --> 33:50.660
You care not to share
your company with a murderer?

33:52.261 --> 33:55.131
I'd be a lonely man if I did.

33:56.065 --> 33:58.367
I am no judge...

33:58.467 --> 34:00.737
nor father.

34:02.372 --> 34:04.307
In a short time...

34:04.407 --> 34:08.545
this will be a long time ago.

34:18.754 --> 34:20.723
Camp here.

34:21.290 --> 34:24.027
- Blanket?
- Thank you.

34:30.766 --> 34:34.387
I shall dream up some advice,
and in the morning,

34:34.487 --> 34:36.774
dish it up with fresh eggs.

34:39.641 --> 34:42.946
- What's your name?
- Werner.

34:45.848 --> 34:47.972
I'm Jay.

34:48.317 --> 34:50.987
Goodnight, and thank you, Werner.

37:24.807 --> 37:27.076
You can eat those.

37:29.712 --> 37:32.215
Eat enough of them, you can fly to Rose.

37:34.283 --> 37:35.819
You kill Werner?

37:39.188 --> 37:41.124
No.

37:41.224 --> 37:42.992
No reason.

37:51.467 --> 37:55.705
This is all the money I have.
Get me there in one piece.

37:58.574 --> 38:00.543
Sure, kid.

38:00.750 --> 38:02.024
Have a biscuit.

38:41.384 --> 38:43.719
That's just a shame.

38:45.921 --> 38:47.757
Is it?

38:48.858 --> 38:50.627
No.

38:53.095 --> 38:55.297
No, it's not.

38:56.699 --> 39:00.737
Charles Darwin talks of evolution
by natural selection.

39:03.039 --> 39:05.908
For our sake, let's hope he's wrong.

39:47.950 --> 39:50.953
Knife's gotta be as sharp as a razor.

39:54.490 --> 39:57.426
You hold the knife flush
against the skin.

39:57.526 --> 40:01.030
And it's a scraping motion
against the grain.

40:01.330 --> 40:03.833
Not a slicing motion.

40:04.834 --> 40:06.902
Like so.

40:08.337 --> 40:10.273
That'll make you presentable for her.

40:15.544 --> 40:18.147
I know why you need my help.

40:19.849 --> 40:21.917
Oh, yeah?

40:22.485 --> 40:24.287
Yeah.

40:24.387 --> 40:26.589
You're lonely.

40:26.856 --> 40:29.091
You're a lonely man.

40:29.191 --> 40:30.506
Sure, kid.

40:30.606 --> 40:32.728
Sure, kid.

40:32.828 --> 40:35.031
Let's drift.

40:35.131 --> 40:39.001
The silent, lonely drifter.

40:39.568 --> 40:42.872
You're a lonely, lonely man.

40:44.573 --> 40:46.184
No need to concern over me.

40:47.476 --> 40:49.678
Hold still.

40:51.063 --> 40:53.449
All I'm sayin' is...

40:53.549 --> 40:55.785
there's more to life
than just survivin'.

40:55.935 --> 40:58.521
Yeah, there's dyin'.

40:59.989 --> 41:02.825
Survival ain't just
how to skin a jackrabbit.

41:03.659 --> 41:07.229
It's knowing when to bluster
and when to hush.

41:07.630 --> 41:10.166
When to take a beating...

41:10.266 --> 41:12.634
and when to strike.

41:18.574 --> 41:21.043
Where's your folks?

41:22.345 --> 41:24.430
Father's in the ground in Ireland,

41:24.530 --> 41:26.816
mother's in the ground in Canada.

41:26.916 --> 41:29.818
So what keeps you from joining 'em?

41:30.920 --> 41:33.757
I don't know, kid. Quit askin' me shit.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.262
I was fine 'til you showed up.

41:39.562 --> 41:42.321
I showed up? You showed up.

41:43.566 --> 41:46.568
Yeah, well, maybe I'm tired
of showin' up.

41:51.574 --> 41:53.109
You're done.

42:32.982 --> 42:35.151
May I enter?

42:35.251 --> 42:37.420
It's a free country.

42:37.520 --> 42:40.122
Try telling the Natives that.

42:40.222 --> 42:43.793
I propose a trade, a mug of coffee

42:43.893 --> 42:46.392
for the finest imported absinthe

42:46.492 --> 42:49.899
and a cigar of unrivaled quality.

42:50.499 --> 42:52.735
We drink tea.

43:06.849 --> 43:09.418
One for you, young man.

43:20.763 --> 43:24.333
There's still not a mark on you.

43:24.433 --> 43:25.835
You know him?

43:25.935 --> 43:29.505
- Fuck yourself, Payne.
- I've tried.

43:29.605 --> 43:32.608
Believe me, I have tried.

43:35.578 --> 43:38.014
Well, that's damn fine coffee.

43:38.714 --> 43:40.583
It's tea.

43:51.160 --> 43:53.362
There you are.

43:58.167 --> 44:01.103
To bad times in the green hour.

44:01.203 --> 44:04.166
Down it, boy! That's liquid joy!

44:04.266 --> 44:07.388
- You headed West?
- North.

44:11.013 --> 44:14.050
Yeah, I'm headed... South.

44:14.850 --> 44:17.520
Chill, can't stand it, makes my...

44:17.620 --> 44:20.156
makes my joints ache.

44:29.064 --> 44:32.902
So why North, kid? Someone special?

44:34.637 --> 44:37.440
Your sweetheart, maybe?

44:39.875 --> 44:42.907
I'm teasing, I'm teasing. I'm teasing.

44:46.882 --> 44:49.920
You must be born on a Sunday?
You born on a Sunday?

44:53.989 --> 44:56.692
Yeah? You born on a Sunday?

44:56.792 --> 44:58.461
I don't know.

44:58.561 --> 45:01.931
So, it's fortunate
that you're... headed North

45:02.031 --> 45:04.500
'cause West...

45:04.600 --> 45:08.991
It's bad, it's big trouble.
Big storm coming.

45:09.672 --> 45:12.174
Easy, Payne. He's just a kid.

45:12.274 --> 45:16.412
No, he's not.
He's an outlaw, just like us.

45:17.012 --> 45:21.450
Anywho, let's drink.
To friends! Old and new.

45:33.929 --> 45:35.798
Spin it.

45:39.201 --> 45:40.603
That's pretty good.

45:46.208 --> 45:49.079
Get that dirt, all of it,
clean, clean it.

46:07.496 --> 46:09.422
I need to piss.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.769
Away from camp.

46:20.209 --> 46:24.046
It's easy to see
how you two crossed paths.

46:24.446 --> 46:28.951
One's a falling angel,
the other one's a rising devil.

46:30.152 --> 46:32.655
I ain't no angel...

46:34.056 --> 46:35.858
True.

46:38.127 --> 46:40.971
Do you think that's a smart play?

46:41.330 --> 46:43.666
Teaming up with him?

46:43.766 --> 46:47.102
Quicker than tracking him, simpler.

46:47.970 --> 46:50.673
Ain't no play about it.

46:51.640 --> 46:54.577
Yeah, I guess if you knew
where Rose and Daddy was,

46:54.677 --> 46:56.712
you'd be done babysitting.

47:03.986 --> 47:07.222
Never was a bean-spiller, was ya?

47:07.522 --> 47:09.692
Not... sober,

47:09.792 --> 47:13.662
nor liquored up, never was.

47:15.998 --> 47:18.867
What you gonna do
with two thousand dollars?

47:24.940 --> 47:27.409
Come back to us.

47:27.509 --> 47:30.183
I'm not like you, Payne.

47:56.438 --> 47:57.974
Silas?

48:08.684 --> 48:11.587
What have you done with Silas And Payne?

48:12.487 --> 48:14.223
Back down, kid.

48:14.323 --> 48:18.127
Payne needs him alive.
You'll get your chance.

48:19.361 --> 48:21.630
What've you done with the river?

48:22.230 --> 48:23.807
They took it.

48:32.124 --> 48:35.511
- Who took it?
- Didn't see their face.

48:35.611 --> 48:37.413
Kid.

48:46.021 --> 48:50.859
All I'm saying... is, in my day,
we tried to keep outta the papers.

48:50.959 --> 48:53.862
You youngsters tryin'
to get in 'em makes no sense.

48:53.962 --> 48:58.901
All I'm sayin', Skell,
is I want folks to respect me.

48:59.001 --> 49:02.005
What's the point in dyin'
if nobody knows you're dead?

49:02.805 --> 49:04.841
Same goes for killing.

49:10.445 --> 49:15.451
I partnered up with a youngling, once
upon a time, by the name of Bill Allson.

49:16.418 --> 49:18.954
He was dying to be famous.

49:19.054 --> 49:21.957
Actually, killing to be famous.

49:22.057 --> 49:24.310
He come to me one time, and he said...

49:24.660 --> 49:28.263
<i>I killed 30 men, and countless savages,</i>

49:28.363 --> 49:31.834
<i>and I still ain't got me
no Wanted poster.</i>

49:31.934 --> 49:34.203
<i>Where's the justice in that, I said?</i>

49:34.303 --> 49:36.205
<i>So I'm thinking</i>

49:36.305 --> 49:40.242
<i>the only way to stop this kid
from croakin' more innocents</i>

49:40.342 --> 49:44.096
<i>is to draw up a poster. Let him find it.</i>

49:44.196 --> 49:47.651
<i>The next morning, I pinned the poster
outside the waterin' hole</i>

49:47.751 --> 49:49.314
<i>he was drowning in.</i>

49:49.714 --> 49:51.854
<i>Wasn't long before he sees the poster,</i>

49:51.954 --> 49:55.908
<i>"Bill Allson, $500 dead or alive."</i>

49:56.008 --> 49:58.593
- <i>He yells me over.</i>
- Skelly!

49:58.693 --> 50:01.063
<i>And what he says chills me to the bone.</i>

50:01.463 --> 50:04.834
- What'd he say?
- "Be a thousand by the 'morrow."

50:06.335 --> 50:10.673
<i>The next morning, I go to get the poster,</i>
<i>and pin it up in the next town.</i>

50:10.773 --> 50:12.741
<i>The poster ain't there.</i>

50:13.241 --> 50:16.281
I hear a gunshot and a body hit dirt.

50:16.912 --> 50:20.940
<i>Spin around to see
this mean son of a bitch</i>

50:21.040 --> 50:23.444
<i>leaning over a... blob.</i>

50:24.753 --> 50:27.256
Well, I'm presuming this bastard
seen the poster,

50:27.356 --> 50:30.980
thought it real, and gunned down
Bill for the reward.

50:32.260 --> 50:34.855
<i>So I walk and I shoot, and bang!</i>

50:34.955 --> 50:37.632
He falls to his knees and dies.

50:37.732 --> 50:42.571
On his knees, like he's prayin'
to be alive again.

50:44.773 --> 50:48.779
As I... walked towards
the dear departed,

50:49.544 --> 50:52.848
<i>Bill Allson steps out
from the saloon across the street.</i>

50:52.948 --> 50:55.358
<i>Alive as you an' I.</i>

50:55.458 --> 50:59.214
Bottle of whiskey in one hand,
and the wanted poster in the other.

50:59.314 --> 51:03.659
<i>I step up to the prayin' dead man
and nudge him with my boot.</i>

51:03.759 --> 51:08.481
<i>He falls, revealin' a... a dead lump
of fur and meat.</i>

51:09.965 --> 51:12.469
It was a goddamned black bear.

51:14.803 --> 51:18.173
- You know what Bill Allson says to me?
- What'd he say?

51:18.273 --> 51:22.878
He says, "You jealous bastard,
trying to get your own poster."

51:25.414 --> 51:27.316
Bullshit!

51:27.416 --> 51:29.203
That's a good one, Skelly.

51:31.386 --> 51:35.424
There's been an appalling
misunderstanding.

51:35.524 --> 51:37.492
I'm at the wrong camp.

51:37.592 --> 51:39.671
Goodnight. Good riddance.

51:45.433 --> 51:49.037
<i>The good Lord brings the rain</i>

51:49.137 --> 51:53.241
<i>To wash away our troubles</i>

51:53.341 --> 51:57.245
<i>The devil adds the lightning</i>

51:57.345 --> 52:01.250
<i>To show us he's still near</i>

52:01.350 --> 52:04.675
<i>So the good Lord sends some thunder</i>

52:05.587 --> 52:09.157
<i>To warn us of the devil</i>

52:09.257 --> 52:15.063
<i>But the devil's gonna blow us all away</i>

52:15.163 --> 52:19.468
Silas. There's some people in the woods.

52:19.568 --> 52:20.875
You love her?

52:21.903 --> 52:24.707
- Who?
- Rose.

52:25.874 --> 52:29.379
- Yes.
- Then go home, kid.

52:30.212 --> 52:31.718
She's mine.

52:32.647 --> 52:34.883
She's nobody's.

52:45.961 --> 52:47.129
Fighting talk!

52:52.951 --> 52:55.804
You're always shushing me!

53:01.009 --> 53:03.879
'Cause you're always
running your mouth off.

54:23.091 --> 54:25.293
Jay-bird,

54:25.393 --> 54:27.262
why so sad?

54:27.362 --> 54:29.131
Silas!

54:29.231 --> 54:31.099
Silas!

54:32.384 --> 54:34.132
Silas!

54:46.448 --> 54:49.784
Silas! I can't find my gun!

54:54.599 --> 54:57.071
Son of a bitch! Shit!

54:58.393 --> 55:00.328
Help!

55:31.760 --> 55:33.402
Come in, Kotori.

55:44.005 --> 55:45.541
Kotori.

56:08.263 --> 56:10.799
Turned out nice again.

56:12.000 --> 56:12.970
Coffee.

56:14.703 --> 56:18.207
You always asks for coffee,
and you always spits it out.

56:30.719 --> 56:33.522
- For God's sake.
- Language, Rose.

56:35.190 --> 56:38.244
An improvement, it stays on the table.

56:47.135 --> 56:49.563
Only thing dry's my mouth.

56:50.972 --> 56:53.455
My head is killing me.

56:54.208 --> 56:57.045
You remember nothing from last night?

56:57.779 --> 57:00.148
I remember Payne,

57:00.248 --> 57:02.250
then rain.

57:12.694 --> 57:13.858
Give me that rope.

57:31.112 --> 57:33.348
Not bad, kid.

57:44.359 --> 57:48.830
<i>I must've been Jay's age
when I joined Payne's gang.</i>

57:49.564 --> 57:53.335
<i>Those were prosperous times
in our trade.</i>

57:54.269 --> 57:58.458
<i>When I split, I was lucky
to do so with my life.</i>

58:03.244 --> 58:05.046
Whoa.

58:18.593 --> 58:20.728
What do they want?

58:22.030 --> 58:25.367
They're bounty hunters.
You know what that means?

58:25.467 --> 58:30.206
- They hunt bounty.
- They hunt Rose, Daddy, blood, money.

58:47.355 --> 58:50.419
- "Wanted dead or alive..."
- Dead or dead, kid.

58:57.899 --> 59:00.402
And I'm leading them to her.

59:03.337 --> 59:06.240
- We'll lead them South.
- There'll be others.

59:06.340 --> 59:07.876
Others?

59:07.976 --> 59:11.981
Two thousand dollars entices
a certain breed of undesirable.

59:12.981 --> 59:15.483
Just what breed are you?

59:22.223 --> 59:26.595
Local tribes call this forest
"The Place of Spirit Trees".

59:27.395 --> 59:30.131
Trappers call it "Silver Ghost".

59:31.032 --> 59:34.536
Legend has it, folks go in,
they don't come out.

59:36.104 --> 59:39.616
At least we may shed the superstitious
from Payne's company.

59:50.351 --> 59:52.858
Oh, God damn you, Silas.

01:00:10.338 --> 01:00:12.474
Who be it?

01:00:12.907 --> 01:00:14.276
Victor Self.

01:00:14.776 --> 01:00:17.045
Reverend Victor Self.

01:00:17.145 --> 01:00:20.349
Sorry to bother you, looking
for a chap by the name of Parker.

01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:24.820
James Parker.

01:00:26.087 --> 01:00:30.458
No Parkers here, Minister.
Won't you come in?

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.631
Sir, I thank you, but decline.

01:00:37.231 --> 01:00:39.034
Rose!

01:00:39.934 --> 01:00:41.770
I'm sorry, Minister.

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:44.105
The Good Lord has me on an errand.

01:00:44.205 --> 01:00:46.506
Bless you. And your lovely wife.

01:00:47.106 --> 01:00:48.676
My daughter.

01:00:51.345 --> 01:00:53.348
Good day, Sir.

01:01:02.824 --> 01:01:05.346
Heavens above, Rose.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.896
Scotland is far, far away.

01:01:08.996 --> 01:01:13.234
Nobody knows where we are.
Nobody knows who we are.

01:01:13.334 --> 01:01:15.570
He knows I'm your daughter,

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:19.656
I'm called Rose,
and he knows we're here.

01:01:20.274 --> 01:01:22.950
He was sent by Providence.

01:01:24.212 --> 01:01:27.615
The Lord sensed my wavering faith.

01:01:28.916 --> 01:01:31.386
Rain is coming.

01:01:43.965 --> 01:01:47.602
"Thou shall not be afraid
of any terror of night,

01:01:48.102 --> 01:01:51.417
nor for the arrow that flyeth by day.

01:01:51.517 --> 01:01:54.676
For the pestilence
that waketh in darkness,

01:01:54.776 --> 01:01:57.579
nor for the sickness
that destroyeth in noon day."

01:01:57.679 --> 01:02:00.948
"O'er all there hung the shadow of fear,

01:02:01.048 --> 01:02:04.352
a sense of mystery the spirit daunted,

01:02:04.452 --> 01:02:07.222
and said as plain
as a whisper in the ear,

01:02:08.022 --> 01:02:10.425
this place is haunted."

01:02:28.209 --> 01:02:31.747
Silas? The trees are moving.

01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:40.388
It's called a hangover, kid.
You'll get used to it.

01:03:10.284 --> 01:03:12.299
Nice catch.

01:03:17.124 --> 01:03:19.594
I'll fix you up on the way.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.849
I've made it.

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.886
You sure that's them?

01:04:55.189 --> 01:04:57.925
Exactly what I imagined.

01:05:04.665 --> 01:05:09.049
Hey. Silas! S-Silas!
Silas, what are you doing?

01:05:09.149 --> 01:05:13.441
Stop! No! Silas, Silas!

01:05:22.186 --> 01:05:24.385
Do it quick.

01:05:24.852 --> 01:05:26.092
I ain't gonna kill you.

01:05:27.088 --> 01:05:31.125
I'm keeping you alive.
We don't have a gun between us.

01:05:31.225 --> 01:05:32.827
Hold still.

01:05:32.927 --> 01:05:36.664
- What is this?
- It stops the sun burning you up.

01:05:36.764 --> 01:05:41.202
- I'll protect Rose or die trying!
- That's what I'm afraid of.

01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:44.740
Lay a finger on her, and I'll kill you!

01:06:42.463 --> 01:06:43.891
Dada!

01:06:46.367 --> 01:06:48.236
Da!

01:07:38.385 --> 01:07:41.553
John Ross! Rose Ross! John Ross!

01:07:41.653 --> 01:07:45.393
You need to leave this house!
There are men coming here to kill you!

01:07:52.233 --> 01:07:53.668
Rose.

01:07:58.239 --> 01:08:00.074
Easy.

01:08:01.242 --> 01:08:02.590
I'm a friend.

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:47.822
Kill that house!

01:10:14.208 --> 01:10:16.444
I know how to do a job right.

01:10:16.544 --> 01:10:19.481
Yes, sir, no, sir,
three bags full of sh...

01:11:13.801 --> 01:11:15.169
Kotori.

01:11:16.003 --> 01:11:20.541
<i>I be carried to the sky</i>

01:11:21.942 --> 01:11:25.960
<i>On a flowery bed of ease</i>

01:11:27.581 --> 01:11:32.619
<i>While others fight to win the prize</i>

01:11:41.028 --> 01:11:44.879
<i>And sail the bloody seas</i>

01:12:58.906 --> 01:13:01.912
Until civilization arrives.

01:14:22.155 --> 01:14:24.024
Kotori.

01:14:46.446 --> 01:14:48.782
Rose...

01:14:53.353 --> 01:14:55.489
Jay...

01:15:24.585 --> 01:15:26.120
Jay.

01:15:40.834 --> 01:15:43.371
Silly boy.

01:16:07.394 --> 01:16:10.364
Turn around, Rose.

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:18.706
It's over.

01:16:20.807 --> 01:16:22.709
Doesn't hurt.

01:17:05.886 --> 01:17:07.722
Jay.

01:17:28.108 --> 01:17:30.926
He loved you with all his heart.

01:17:38.685 --> 01:17:41.868
His heart was in the wrong place.

01:17:47.294 --> 01:17:50.011
His spirit was true.

01:18:56.463 --> 01:18:59.666
<i>There is more to life than survival.</i>

01:18:59.766 --> 01:19:02.569
<i>Jay Cavendish taught me that.</i>

01:19:03.403 --> 01:19:06.077
<i>I owe him my life.</i>

01:19:09.776 --> 01:19:12.279
<i>Ho for the West.</i>
