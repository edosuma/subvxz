10:39.080 --> 10:40.560
[SNIFFLES]

10:47.440 --> 10:49.318
Sabrina, can we come in?

10:49.480 --> 10:53.713
- Oh, no. She's gone again.
SABRINA: No, I'm not. I'm on the bed.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.314
Oh, how'd you get over here?

10:55.840 --> 10:57.638
SABRINA:
Salem carried me in his mouth.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.156
It took all my self-control
not to eat her.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.000
You're still small.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.117
We thought you'd be feeling
bigger by now.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.555
No.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.633
I think I'm gonna be 6 inches tall
for the rest of my life.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.315
You know, it's not a good idea
to go to bed tiny.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.675
But I really messed up.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.071
The important thing is that you learn
from your mistakes.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.596
- We all make them.
- Except Zelda. She's perfect.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.433
Even I make mistakes.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.080
Although it's been a while.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.800
Hey, maybe you guys could tell me
about some of your mess-ups.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.360
It might make me feel better.

11:25.520 --> 11:26.590
Oh, me first.

11:26.760 --> 11:30.754
Let me tell you how I went from man
to cat in one dumb move.

11:30.920 --> 11:35.039
Our first plan of attack
is to take Madagascar.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.510
It works in Risk, it'll work for us.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.670
Cream and sugar?

11:38.840 --> 11:41.196
- Can we focus?
- Sorry.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.110
Follow me. And I promise

11:44.280 --> 11:49.196
I will be the most benevolent dictator
the world has ever seen.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.352
Did I say dictator? I meant leader.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.759
The time is now. Witch power.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.560
Witch power. Witch power.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.076
Oh no, the witch fuzz. We're busted.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.469
OFFICER:
Party's over, Salem.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.950
You're under arrest for conspiracy
to dominate the world.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.793
SALEM:
But we're a non-profit organization.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.158
We meet to discuss
new ways of thinking.

12:11.040 --> 12:14.670
So I was sentenced to
a hundred years behind whiskers.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.560
- At least you have a nice home.
- Rent free, I might add.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.473
So how did you guys
end up with Salem?

12:19.640 --> 12:22.474
That's Hilda's fault. I mean, story.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.996
Forgive me.
I was young and idealistic

12:25.160 --> 12:27.277
and I thought
Salem might actually pull it off.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.557
- You were one of his followers?
- Yes.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.518
I was on the refreshment
committee.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.514
So they turned Salem into a cat,
but how were you punished?

12:34.680 --> 12:37.195
I have to keep him worm-free
for a century.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.074
Whoa. You know
what just dawned on me?

12:40.240 --> 12:42.800
You guys had lives before I got here.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.955
This is amazing.
We have a lot of catching up to do.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.793
So were you ever kids?

12:47.960 --> 12:51.271
Yes. Although it was back
in the 14th century.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.875
There were no phones, no TVs.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.271
Things were very different.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.238
Behold the abacus.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.279
- Behold the "blab-acus."
- Quiet.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.716
- Why are we doing this?
- To enlighten the masses.

13:04.280 --> 13:08.320
The abacus is a modern instrument
for performing arithmetic calculations

13:08.480 --> 13:11.632
developed by the greatest scientific
minds of the Orient. Cut it out.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.314
I wasn't doing anything.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.119
You always go for the cheap laugh.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.839
I do not.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.913
I am sick of your pathetic attempts
to try and get attention.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.117
Now can I get back to the abacus?

13:22.960 --> 13:25.520
Each lower bead equals one.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.637
Each upper bead equals five.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.031
Can I see that? My abacus.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.793
No, it's mine, it's mine.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.952
She always takes my stuff.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.909
In retrospect,
things weren't really different at all.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.432
Where is the list?
I wanna put "abacus" on it.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.716
This is so much fun.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.634
Tell me more. Have you always been
a musician and a scientist?

13:44.800 --> 13:46.917
No. I bounced from job to job
for centuries.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.834
It took me awhile to figure out
what I wanted to do to.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.151
So, what was the worst job
you ever had?

13:52.320 --> 13:55.950
Hard to say. Blacksmith,
donkey walker.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.919
Oh, I'd have to go with
deep-sea fisherman.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.118
Halibut ho! Hard to starboard.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.999
The other starboard, kelp-head.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.516
It was awful.

14:09.680 --> 14:13.117
Chapped lips, salt water,
bad combination.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.590
It's your turn, Aunt Zelda.
What was your worst job?

14:15.760 --> 14:17.991
I think it was back
when I lived in Wales

14:18.160 --> 14:21.471
and I tried my hand at coal mining.

14:21.640 --> 14:25.634
I told you if we went deep enough
we'd find a seam, Bynnik.

14:25.800 --> 14:26.995
How you doing, Chirpy?

14:29.360 --> 14:31.955
Chirpy? Canary's dead.

14:32.120 --> 14:35.636
Let's get out of here.
Oh push, Arfon, push.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.276
I still can't get my fingernails clean.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.193
Zelda, I thought you said
your worst job was--

14:40.360 --> 14:41.589
Let's not bring that up.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.831
Yes, let's. Please, let's.
What did you do?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.959
It was the one time
Hilda and I worked together.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.670
The West was still wild and there
were only two ways to make money:

14:50.840 --> 14:52.991
law enforcement

14:53.160 --> 14:55.311
and show biz.

14:58.720 --> 15:02.555
Thank you, thank you for that warm
Buzzard Gulch welcome.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.150
Enough patter.

15:05.760 --> 15:10.198
Our first number
is one of our favourite songs.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.511
And we hope you like it too.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.671
[SINGING] <i>Oh, I come from Alabama
With a banjo on my knee</i>

15:18.840 --> 15:23.551
<i>Oh, I'm going to Louisiana
My true love for to see</i>

15:23.720 --> 15:28.795
<i>Oh, Susanna
Oh, don't you cry for me</i>

15:28.960 --> 15:30.474
They hate us.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.630
We made two bits that night.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.792
And then they ran us out of town.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.953
Fortunately, we figured out the secret
to financial security.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.158
- What secret?
- Should we let her in on it?

15:42.320 --> 15:44.198
The secret is junk.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.080
Hold on to anything long enough
and it'll become valuable.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.675
We just sold our old pewter dishes
to the Smithsonian

15:49.840 --> 15:51.399
for an obscene amount of money.

15:51.560 --> 15:54.598
And you know what's gonna keep us
in cruises during our golden years?

15:54.760 --> 15:56.638
Plaid thermoses in mint condition.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.275
Okay, we've covered jobs, money.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.319
Now let's get to the good stuff,
your love lives.

16:03.480 --> 16:07.554
All right. But first, Salem, out.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.473
Fine. I'll leave you girls alone.

16:09.640 --> 16:10.790
I have to use the box anyway.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.520
Okay, so how old were you
when you had your first kiss?

16:14.680 --> 16:17.400
- Sixteen.
- Forty-eight.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.199
And have either of you
ever been married?

16:19.360 --> 16:23.434
- Sabrina, that might not be the best--
- It's all right. I can talk about it.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.751
As you know,
I was engaged to Drell.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.513
The wedding was all planned.

16:27.680 --> 16:32.914
I had the Acropolis, a maid of honour,
a fantastic caterer.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.278
The only thing I didn't have was Drell.

16:38.960 --> 16:42.192
- He's five minutes late.
- He'll be here.

16:45.240 --> 16:48.199
- He's an hour late.
- He'll be here.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.040
It's getting cold.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.078
All right. Let's go.

16:54.240 --> 16:58.200
- Hilda, I'm sorry.
- Don't be. I'm fine.

17:05.319 --> 17:06.674
So that's why it's in ruins.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.991
Fortunately,
history has blamed the Turks.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.959
And how about you, Aunt Zelda?
Have you ever been married?

17:12.119 --> 17:13.634
Never. She's too picky.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.951
Actually, I have.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.156
What? When?

17:18.319 --> 17:20.960
- Why didn't I know about this?
- I don't tell you everything.

17:21.119 --> 17:22.440
Tell me, tell me.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.832
I was living in Florence during
the Renaissance

17:26.200 --> 17:27.953
<i>- and I met a guy.</i>
- Benvolio?

17:28.119 --> 17:29.600
In the flesh.

17:29.760 --> 17:33.117
- What are you doing here?
- I cannot stay away from thee, Zelda.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.680
Oh, I missed thee too.

17:34.840 --> 17:38.629
But what if someone see us?
My father does not like thee much.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.790
Is he near?

17:39.960 --> 17:42.395
Nay, he tarries at the bear baiting.

17:42.560 --> 17:47.430
Odds bodkins, I'm in luck.
I wrote a song for thee. Shall I strum?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.193
Prithee.

17:49.360 --> 17:53.115

Work in progress.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.719
Benvolio, I love it.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.553
Well, you wore
green sleeves yesterday.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.236
It is beautiful.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.153
Oh, beauty pales in your wake.

18:24.880 --> 18:29.079
- Marry me.
- Oh, thou playest me like a lute.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.719
Yea, I will marry you.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.839
Huzzah. Come, I know a chapel
in a field of myrrh.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.320
They're open all night.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.233
This is crazy.

18:39.120 --> 18:42.557
It lasted three days. Musicians.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.280
I can't believe you never told me
about Benvolio.

18:45.440 --> 18:48.194
- It wasn't that big a deal.
- Not a big deal?

18:48.360 --> 18:51.159
It means you made a mistake.
You're not perfect.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.312
This is the greatest night of my life.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.631
I'll get the camera.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.951
Maybe we should let Sabrina
get some sleep.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.713
No, I want to ask more questions.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.394
All right. One more.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.597
Okay. It should be important.

19:03.760 --> 19:08.835
Did you guys ever make your own
sausage? No, wait. I can do better.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.431
How did you guys decide
to let me come live with you?

19:11.600 --> 19:13.831
Oh, that was an easy decision.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.310
See, we knew you would be coming
into your powers soon.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.711
And with your mother in Peru
and your father in a book,

19:18.880 --> 19:21.270
we thought the best place for you
would be here.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.473
I can't believe Sabrina arrives
in two weeks.

19:23.640 --> 19:27.395
I know. I spent the whole second act
thinking about it.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.591
Good evening, Sylvio.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.150
Thanks.

19:32.320 --> 19:33.674
I mean, as strange as it seems,

19:33.840 --> 19:36.753
we may be the closest thing
she has to a normal home.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.354
True. We're witches.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.352
But we're suburban witches.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.512
I just hope we're not getting in
over our heads.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.195
Sabrina's spent the last
five summers with us.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.192
What if we make a mistake
and ruin her life?

19:47.400 --> 19:49.232
We won't.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.794
Derrick, I'll have my massage later.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.350
Yay, caviar. My favourite.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.477
Now, you do realise
once Sabrina's here,

19:57.640 --> 19:59.154
we'll have to make a few changes.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.310
Like what?

20:00.480 --> 20:03.791
No more late nights on the town,
no more weekends in Tuscany.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.350
- No more Formula One racing?
- Too risky.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.638
Hey, we can turn the second
floor disco into her bedroom.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.954
Don't pout, Lance.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.715
Which reminds me, there's something
else we'll have to give up.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.678
- You mean?
- I'm afraid so.

20:18.280 --> 20:21.717
Sylvio, Lance, Derrick.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.473
We need to talk.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.430
But why'd you get rid of them?

20:27.600 --> 20:29.353
We thought servants might spoil you.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.591
We wanted to teach you
responsibility.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.399
And to respect men.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.190
But you gave up so much.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.353
It seems like taking me in was
the biggest mistake you've ever made.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.911
Don't say that.
We love having you live with us.

20:43.080 --> 20:46.232
And we have never regretted it
for one moment.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.154
Really?

20:48.840 --> 20:50.957
Hey, I feel something bubbling.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.918
Stand back.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.118
[YELLS]

20:56.120 --> 20:58.794
Hey, I'm normal size again.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.030
Is that it?

21:00.200 --> 21:01.680
I could have sworn you were taller.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.433
I'm glad you're feeling bigger.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.274
Me too. And I appreciate you guys
telling me all those stories

21:06.440 --> 21:08.079
about all the weird stuff you've done.

21:08.240 --> 21:11.358
It made me realise how lucky I am
to live with such cool aunts.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.193
Thanks for everything.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.556
- Am I still grounded?
- Yes.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.634
I knew that.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.870
- Surprise.
- What's the occasion?

21:25.040 --> 21:26.235
I'm celebrating you.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.710
Our talk made me realise
we've been through a lot together.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.349
- And I wanted you to have this.
- How sweet.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.514
My abacus.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.957
- I found it in my sock drawer.
- Oh, thanks for returning it.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.032
Wait. It's broken.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.475
I was 8. And mad at you.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.155
- Now I can't use it.
- You have a computer.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.836
Only you would give me a gift
that belonged to me in the first place.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.036
Can I see that?

21:49.200 --> 21:51.954
- My abacus.
- It's mine, it's mine.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.430
She always takes my stuff.

21:55.305 --> 22:01.522
