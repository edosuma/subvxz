40:31.860 --> 40:32.724
TIMES. IT JUST NEEDS TIME

40:32.730 --> 40:34.550
TO SPREAD.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.754
RIGHT?

40:35.760 --> 40:37.523
>> [SIGHS]

40:37.530 --> 40:39.896
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN NEEDLE.

40:39.900 --> 40:43.597
SHE LOOKS DEFORMED.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.501
>> [JENNA CHATTERING]

40:46.510 --> 40:48.978
>> [SIGHS]

40:48.980 --> 40:50.732
>> SEE, SHE'S NOT EVEN CRYING.

40:50.740 --> 40:52.776
LIKE THEY SAID, WHEN YOU MIX IT

40:52.780 --> 40:54.270
WITH LIDOCAINE, IT JUST FEELS

40:54.280 --> 40:57.113
LIKE A KISS.

40:57.120 --> 41:00.715
>> [SIGHS]

41:00.720 --> 41:02.859
>> OH...

41:02.860 --> 41:04.987
NOW YOU ARE PERFECT,

41:04.990 --> 41:07.254
AREN'T YOU, SWEETIE?

41:07.260 --> 41:08.796
>> BY THE TIME I TURN AROUND,

41:08.800 --> 41:11.667
YOU BETTER BE GONE.

41:16.670 --> 41:18.706
>> DON'T WORRY, GRANDPA.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.302
YOUR REPUTATION'S SAFE,

41:20.310 --> 41:22.676
I'LL TAKE THE FALL.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.648
EVERYONE THINKS I'M A HORRIBLE

41:24.650 --> 41:28.006
MOTHER ANYWAYS.
