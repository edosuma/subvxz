WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:27.926 --> 01:30.588
Powers of darkness, hear me.

01:31.263 --> 01:33.754
Break open the stone.

01:41.039 --> 01:44.167
Nothing? None of my magic works?

01:45.511 --> 01:49.413
Molkrom, our prince of destruction,
has been imprisoned for centuries.

01:49.848 --> 01:53.682
You promised to find the weak point
in the crystal and free him.

01:53.952 --> 01:57.756
The magic of the Elders is too
strong, King Von.

01:57.756 --> 02:00.691
Only something with
their power will free him.

02:00.893 --> 02:03.418
I know of just such a thing, Skeletor.

02:03.662 --> 02:05.186
Then, get it!

02:10.235 --> 02:13.102
I'm glad you could make it to
this celebration of ours, He-Man.

02:13.805 --> 02:15.568
I wouldn't miss it, Stratos.

02:15.741 --> 02:17.936
It's only once a year
you take out the staff

02:18.210 --> 02:20.007
given to your people by the elders.

02:20.445 --> 02:22.538
Just what does that staff do, Stratos?

02:22.781 --> 02:23.679
This!

02:36.562 --> 02:38.120
Avion is being attacked.

02:38.497 --> 02:39.794
Man the defenses!

02:59.751 --> 03:02.413
You know how to work
a photon cannon, Teela?

03:02.654 --> 03:03.985
I'm a fast learner, Father.

03:22.407 --> 03:24.341
Got to stop those heat rays.

03:34.453 --> 03:35.715
Clear out!

03:58.477 --> 04:00.240
He-Man!  Are you alright?

04:00.545 --> 04:02.342
Just... mussed my hair.

04:15.560 --> 04:18.188
Torg soldiers, fall back!

04:18.596 --> 04:21.394
We have captured the Staff
that will free Molkrom.

04:23.368 --> 04:25.336
Who were those creatures, Delora?

04:25.637 --> 04:26.934
I have no idea, He-Man.

04:27.239 --> 04:29.571
All I know is that they've taken Stratos.

04:29.741 --> 04:31.368
One of them mentioned Molkrom.

04:31.576 --> 04:34.306
Molkrom?
The Sorceress might know that name.

04:34.613 --> 04:38.310
Delora. I promise you.
I'll bring Stratos back.

04:38.984 --> 04:42.215
Stratos is my brother, He-Man.
I'm going with you.

04:42.454 --> 04:43.478
Very well.

04:54.566 --> 04:56.727
Now tell me, King of the Bird Men.

04:56.968 --> 04:58.663
How do I use this Staff?

04:58.904 --> 05:00.337
I'll never tell you.

05:01.506 --> 05:02.939
You will!

05:04.643 --> 05:06.235
You will!

05:12.350 --> 05:14.250
This is Molkrom.

05:23.962 --> 05:26.453
With him, the Torgs were invincible.

05:26.665 --> 05:28.690
So the Elders used their magic...

05:28.967 --> 05:32.926
to imprison him deep in the
caves, in which the Torgs live.

05:34.940 --> 05:38.137
Caves? I don't like the sound of that.

05:38.643 --> 05:41.510
The Staff of Avion can free Molkrom...

05:41.813 --> 05:44.941
and Molkrom has the power
to destroy Grayskull.

05:45.183 --> 05:47.276
Then we'd better start moving.

05:47.552 --> 05:49.349
There's something even worse.

05:49.654 --> 05:51.554
Do we really have to know about it?

05:51.723 --> 05:53.850
Once the staff is used for evil,

05:54.059 --> 05:56.721
it must be used quickly to undo that evil,

05:57.095 --> 06:01.464
or it will... explode and
take half of Eternia with it.

06:01.767 --> 06:03.894
Couldn't we be on the other half?

06:12.410 --> 06:14.776
The Torgs live somewhere
in these caves.

06:17.783 --> 06:20.149
Uh, they're not the only things.

06:20.619 --> 06:21.551
Look!

07:23.515 --> 07:24.504
This way.

07:32.157 --> 07:33.249
The Torgs

07:37.028 --> 07:38.689
Time for a fight!

07:41.066 --> 07:42.897
Greetings, He-Man.

07:43.134 --> 07:44.032
Skeletor?

07:44.302 --> 07:46.793
A friend of yours is waiting for you.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.177
Stratos!

07:53.378 --> 07:55.039
Not just one.

07:55.847 --> 07:57.007
Many.

08:01.586 --> 08:06.353
One of them is the real Stratos.
But all are under my spell.

08:11.529 --> 08:14.896
Don't get too rough until we know
which one is the real Stratos.

08:46.998 --> 08:48.989
I'll find out which is the real Stratos.

08:49.167 --> 08:51.032
Delora, no!

08:51.236 --> 08:52.203
Stratos!

08:53.138 --> 08:55.038
We are not your enemies.

08:56.174 --> 08:58.938
Fight the evil spell
that's been placed on you.

09:12.557 --> 09:13.751
Delora?

09:14.793 --> 09:15.885
No!

09:18.830 --> 09:20.889
That's the real Stratos.

09:22.233 --> 09:25.293
My will is returned, and yours is gone.

09:27.772 --> 09:30.400
You are free of Skeletor's magic now.

09:34.980 --> 09:37.915
Staff of Avion, I command you!

09:38.316 --> 09:40.750
Show me the weak point.

09:45.023 --> 09:46.217
There it is.

09:47.826 --> 09:48.690
What?

09:53.198 --> 09:56.690
We have some unfinished business, Skeletor.

09:56.868 --> 10:01.202
True, He-Man, and now is time to finish it.

10:08.780 --> 10:12.147
Foolish mortals, say hello to Molkrom.

10:24.462 --> 10:25.588
Molkrom.

10:26.197 --> 10:28.995
I, Skeletor, have freed you.

10:29.534 --> 10:31.968
Now vanquish my enemies.

10:51.189 --> 10:53.487
And that takes care of them.

10:53.892 --> 10:56.952
Now Molkrom and I,
will take care of Grayskull.

10:57.662 --> 10:59.960
Guard this Staff well, Von.

11:00.298 --> 11:03.426
When I get back,
I plan to learn more of it's secrets.

11:03.935 --> 11:04.993
Molkrom!

11:15.547 --> 11:18.277
First, we'll put this Staff in the Vault.

11:18.516 --> 11:22.077
After that, you can come back here,
and patch that hole in the wall.

11:28.159 --> 11:29.023
Trapped!

11:29.227 --> 11:31.320
Skeletor certainly got
the upper hand this time.

11:31.563 --> 11:32.860
Not for long.

11:42.507 --> 11:44.498
Maybe there's a quicker way.

11:54.552 --> 11:56.577
Ram Man, Man-At-Arms.

11:56.921 --> 11:59.014
I'll need your help at Grayskull.

11:59.257 --> 12:01.088
The rest of you, get that Staff.

12:02.127 --> 12:04.254
Before it explodes.

12:21.546 --> 12:24.777
It's Molkrom. Maybe this will stop him.

12:46.838 --> 12:50.797
Molkrom's magic is
stronger than yours, Sorceress.

12:52.877 --> 12:56.244
Now, Molkrom,
break down the Jawbridge.

13:07.091 --> 13:09.992
The castle is strong,
but not enough.

13:27.645 --> 13:29.840
Well, well, Skeletor.

13:30.848 --> 13:32.679
It's two against one.

13:32.917 --> 13:34.407
Think so?

13:36.621 --> 13:37.781
Think again.

14:01.012 --> 14:03.503
Distract the guards.
I'll get the Staff.

14:03.815 --> 14:05.180
Distract the guards?

14:08.686 --> 14:10.313
I know, I'll try a little magic.

14:16.227 --> 14:18.491
What do you know? It worked!

14:22.333 --> 14:23.891
But not very well.

14:24.502 --> 14:26.163
After them!

14:32.510 --> 14:33.875
What's going on?

14:48.693 --> 14:49.921
Not so fast!

14:51.996 --> 14:53.122
Give me that staff!

14:53.331 --> 14:55.390
King Von: I'll give you this instead.

14:56.067 --> 14:58.001
Why aren't things ever easy?

15:02.173 --> 15:03.606
I'll hold them off.

15:18.790 --> 15:22.282
I have a feeling, this wasn't a good idea.

15:40.411 --> 15:43.175
I'll never make it
unless I drop the Battle Ram.

15:58.463 --> 15:59.760
Hey!

16:04.068 --> 16:06.263
He-Man needs my help.

16:20.785 --> 16:21.809
Zoar!

16:24.088 --> 16:25.316
Are you hurt?

16:25.923 --> 16:27.413
I'm alright.

16:28.593 --> 16:30.151
Better get back to Grayskull.

16:32.697 --> 16:35.825
Now, to open the Jawbridge.

16:39.437 --> 16:42.964
Skeletor is trying to enter.
He'll use all his power.

16:56.487 --> 16:58.387
We've got to help Stratos.

16:58.623 --> 17:00.352
I think I know how. Look!

17:14.137 --> 17:16.196
Stratos, get clear!

17:19.810 --> 17:21.073
Now, Delora!

17:25.550 --> 17:27.040
That should hold him for a while.

17:27.385 --> 17:29.080
Now to help out, Teela.

17:33.691 --> 17:35.124
Teela, are you alright?

17:35.393 --> 17:37.418
Fine, but there's no time to lose.

17:38.162 --> 17:40.653
The Staff of Avion is going to explode.

17:40.965 --> 17:43.525
Get this back to He-Man
before it's too late.

17:54.278 --> 17:56.838
I must keep the Jawbridge closed.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.212
I can't keep this much longer.

18:05.623 --> 18:06.351
He-Man!

18:08.192 --> 18:09.056
Catch!

18:12.930 --> 18:16.195
Molkrom. By the Staff of Avion...

18:16.701 --> 18:17.998
I command you!

18:19.437 --> 18:20.699
He-Man!

18:26.277 --> 18:28.677
The Staff!  It's going to explode!

18:57.608 --> 18:59.974
Back to your prison, Molkrom.

19:04.949 --> 19:06.974
Molkrom is back in the crystal,

19:14.392 --> 19:17.919
a-and the Staff is back to normal.

19:18.296 --> 19:20.264
Oh, that was a close one.

19:22.033 --> 19:26.493
He-Man, help, I'm weakening.

19:28.706 --> 19:32.335
Skeletor is lowering the Jawbridge.

19:36.147 --> 19:37.637
At last...

19:39.116 --> 19:41.983
Grayskull is mine!

19:45.089 --> 19:47.956
Going somewhere, Skeletor?

19:48.259 --> 19:51.695
Very well, He-Man. Another time?

19:54.799 --> 19:56.699
Anytime you like.

20:00.404 --> 20:03.202
Now, to begin the festival!

20:03.407 --> 20:05.898
Let's hope there aren't
any more interruptions.

20:06.877 --> 20:09.072
He-Man, help!

20:11.716 --> 20:13.013
Help!

20:28.766 --> 20:29.926
Boy,

20:30.001 --> 20:31.617
the fruit on that tree looks good enough

20:31.642 --> 20:33.256
to eat, doesn't it? That's like a lot of

20:33.304 --> 20:34.661
things you might find around your

20:34.686 --> 20:35.923
house or in your neighborhood.

20:35.973 --> 20:37.056
But looks can fool you.

20:37.081 --> 20:39.057
Sometimes things that look or smell good

20:39.143 --> 20:41.111
can make you very sick.

20:41.178 --> 20:42.873
Remember, never taste or eat anything

20:43.381 --> 20:45.082
if you're not sure what it is.

20:45.107 --> 20:46.863
The best thing to do is ask a

20:47.084 --> 20:47.989
grown up who knows.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.633
Remember, it's better to be safe

20:49.820 --> 20:50.692
than sorry.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.142
Until next time!
