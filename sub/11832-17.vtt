10:05.732 --> 10:08.782
This is an offensive weapon.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.752
- Ever heard of survivalists,
Mr. Marshall?

10:11.752 --> 10:13.652
- Yes, but survivalists are--
- Might a survivalist

10:13.652 --> 10:15.552
buy this type of gun?

10:15.552 --> 10:16.662
- He might,
but survivalists usually--

10:16.662 --> 10:18.642
- Ever hear the term "plinking,"
Mr. Marshall?

10:18.642 --> 10:19.762
- Oh, please, you're not gonna
tell me that this--

10:19.762 --> 10:22.572
- Ever hear
the term "Plinking," sir?

10:22.572 --> 10:23.582
- Yes.

10:23.582 --> 10:24.602
- What is it?

10:24.602 --> 10:26.562
- Shooting at cans and bottles.

10:26.562 --> 10:29.632
- It's a recreational use
for the TAC-10, isn't it?

10:29.632 --> 10:30.762
- The TAC-10 is designed
to kill people,

10:30.762 --> 10:32.632
not to plink water bottles.
- Objection.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.582
Move to strike.
- Sustained.

10:34.582 --> 10:35.692
- There are uses
for this gun

10:35.692 --> 10:37.552
other than holding up
a convenience store,

10:37.552 --> 10:38.602
aren't there, Mr. Marshall?

10:38.602 --> 10:39.782
- This gun is designed to kill.

10:39.782 --> 10:41.612
It's sold to people...
- Objection. Move to strike.

10:41.612 --> 10:42.732
- Who want to kill.
- Move to strike.

10:42.732 --> 10:44.732
- All right.

10:44.732 --> 10:46.722
- Is it your testimony
before this court

10:46.722 --> 10:48.702
that only criminals
buy this weapon?

10:48.702 --> 10:49.732
Is that your testimony?

10:49.732 --> 10:51.752
- No.
- Thank you.

10:51.752 --> 10:55.572
And do you think
a law-abiding citizen

10:55.572 --> 10:57.552
should be allowed
to purchase this weapon?

10:57.552 --> 10:58.672
- No, I don't.

10:58.672 --> 11:00.722
- Thank you, sir.

11:00.722 --> 11:03.692
I think we all know exactly
where you stand.

11:03.692 --> 11:06.772
[courtroom murmuring]

11:17.632 --> 11:19.702
[school bell rings]
- They were in here.

11:19.702 --> 11:22.552
Seven bags of marijuana.

11:22.552 --> 11:24.592
Frankly, it surprised me,
Mr. Young.

11:24.592 --> 11:26.632
Kendall isn't one of
our problem students.

11:26.632 --> 11:27.752
- The incident report says

11:27.752 --> 11:29.742
that you received
a phone tip from a parent,

11:29.742 --> 11:32.562
but it doesn't say
who the parent was.

11:32.562 --> 11:33.692
- District policy is to keep

11:33.692 --> 11:35.682
that kind of information
confidential.

11:35.682 --> 11:39.562
- What kind
of Gestapo policy is that?

11:39.562 --> 11:40.692
- I start naming names,

11:40.692 --> 11:43.692
and it discourages people
from coming forward.

11:43.692 --> 11:45.782
I've confiscated
two guns this year.

11:45.782 --> 11:48.562
Nobody wants to be a target.

11:48.562 --> 11:51.652
- I understand your concern,
but my son says he was set up,

11:51.652 --> 11:53.662
and you relied on a phone tip.

11:53.662 --> 11:55.782
Now, how do you know the person
on the other line was a parent?

11:55.782 --> 11:57.622
- I recognized the name,

11:57.622 --> 11:59.592
and I recognize a parent
when I hear one.

11:59.592 --> 12:00.702
- We have to know
who the accuser is,

12:00.702 --> 12:01.712
otherwise--
- I'm sorry.

12:01.712 --> 12:03.612
I cannot--
- Ms. Richwood,

12:03.612 --> 12:06.672
you know we can subpoena
this information.

12:06.672 --> 12:08.722
Let's just save some time.

12:10.722 --> 12:13.582
- [sighs]

12:13.582 --> 12:15.652
- They're in the business
of supplying criminals.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.782
- The defendant?
- The defendant,

12:16.782 --> 12:19.722
as well as many other
major gun manufacturers.

12:19.722 --> 12:21.622
- But, Mr. Hedberg,
a person

12:21.622 --> 12:23.592
can't just walk into a store
and buy a gun.

12:23.592 --> 12:25.582
There are background checks,
waiting periods.

12:25.582 --> 12:26.782
- Yes, that all sounds good,

12:26.782 --> 12:29.662
but our studies have found
that straw buyers

12:29.662 --> 12:31.612
go into these dealerships,
buy the guns,

12:31.612 --> 12:33.642
and immediately put them
into a black market.

12:33.642 --> 12:34.782
That's where the gangs
get ahold of them,

12:34.782 --> 12:36.662
as well as other people

12:36.662 --> 12:38.602
who can't legally
buy them on their own.

12:38.602 --> 12:40.552
- But wouldn't that
be the dealer's fault?

12:40.552 --> 12:41.782
How do you blame
the manufacturers?

12:41.782 --> 12:44.642
- I blame them because they turn
a blind eye to it.

12:44.642 --> 12:46.702
They know where
these guns are headed.

12:46.702 --> 12:49.552
That, to me,
makes them complicit.

12:49.552 --> 12:50.732
- You have no direct evidence

12:50.732 --> 12:53.652
that my client's company
knows what the dealerships do.

12:53.652 --> 12:55.662
- How could they not know?
These guns are used--

12:55.662 --> 12:57.622
- It's a guess on your part,
right, Mr. Hedberg?

12:57.622 --> 12:59.742
You have no specific information
as to what my client knows.

12:59.742 --> 13:01.642
This is your opinion.

13:01.642 --> 13:04.732
- The fact is that one buyer
with a clean record

13:04.732 --> 13:08.552
can walk into a store and buy
a hundred assault weapons.

13:08.552 --> 13:11.762
My opinion is that he doesn't
want all these guns for himself.

13:11.762 --> 13:14.692
My guess is that the dealers
and the manufacturers

13:14.692 --> 13:16.602
take the money and wink.

13:16.602 --> 13:18.682
- You work for an anti-gun
research foundation,

13:18.682 --> 13:20.632
don't you, sir?
- Yes.

13:20.632 --> 13:22.552
- And you have no actual
knowledge

13:22.552 --> 13:24.552
as to my client's marketing
strategies, do you, sir?

13:24.552 --> 13:25.692
- No actual knowledge.

13:25.692 --> 13:27.662
They do an excellent job
of keeping that secret.

13:27.662 --> 13:29.682
- Lucky we have you to just
fill in the blanks.

13:29.682 --> 13:31.562
- Objection.
- Sustained.

13:31.562 --> 13:33.662
- These opinions you have...

13:33.662 --> 13:37.572
do you try to pass them off
as data in your studies?

13:37.572 --> 13:39.772
- All of our conclusions
are suggested quite persuasively

13:39.772 --> 13:41.602
by the data, Mr. Lawrence.

13:41.602 --> 13:43.722
- And as you work
for an anti-gun project,

13:43.722 --> 13:45.592
is it just possible

13:45.592 --> 13:47.622
that the conclusions came
before the data?

13:47.622 --> 13:49.732
- No.
- No?

13:49.732 --> 13:51.672
Now there's a truthful response.

13:51.672 --> 13:54.562
- Objection.
- Sustained.

13:54.562 --> 13:55.682
- He hung tough.

13:55.682 --> 13:57.572
I think he did damage.
- I think so too.

13:57.572 --> 13:59.662
- A case like this
represents the perversity

13:59.662 --> 14:01.672
of a legal system gone amok.

14:01.672 --> 14:04.572
Here we have a cause
coupled with an attorney

14:04.572 --> 14:06.612

such as Mr. Berluti...

14:06.612 --> 14:07.612

- Jimmy.

14:07.612 --> 14:08.632

14:08.632 --> 14:09.732
and seek out a victim,

14:09.732 --> 14:11.692
any victim he can
saddle up and ride

14:11.692 --> 14:13.712
in this liberal
jurisdiction of Massachus--

14:13.712 --> 14:15.612
- You're a jackass,
you know that?

14:15.612 --> 14:17.652
Go shoot somebody and smile!
- We just heard from

14:17.652 --> 14:19.682
the ambulance-chasing sector
of the profession--

14:19.682 --> 14:21.652
- The ambulance is filled
with gunshot victims.

14:21.652 --> 14:22.672
- Jimmy, come on!
- This is an attorney

14:22.672 --> 14:23.782
who advertised on television,

14:23.782 --> 14:26.602
billing himself
as "Jimmy the grunt."

14:26.602 --> 14:28.742
This is a man who capitalizes
on people's personal pain

14:28.742 --> 14:30.682
on a--on a contingency.

14:33.752 --> 14:36.652
- Mrs. Baker, I'm Eugene Young.

14:36.652 --> 14:37.752
This is Bobby Donnell.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.702
I'm Kendall Young's father.

14:39.702 --> 14:41.772
We're both attorneys-at-law.

14:41.772 --> 14:43.682
- What do you want?

14:43.682 --> 14:45.732
- We just have
a couple of questions.

14:45.732 --> 14:47.722
It'll only take a minute.

14:49.682 --> 14:50.772
- Come in.

14:54.582 --> 14:57.582
Michael, take Kevin and go
to your room, please.

14:57.582 --> 14:58.592
Now.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.762
I know what this is about.

15:07.762 --> 15:09.722
- So you made the call?

15:09.722 --> 15:10.752
- Yes.

15:10.752 --> 15:13.582
- My son says he was set up.

15:13.582 --> 15:15.642
- Is that what
you told him to say?

15:15.642 --> 15:17.762
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Baker,

15:17.762 --> 15:20.552
but somehow we've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.562
All we're trying
to ascertain here

15:22.562 --> 15:24.592
is why you made the call.

15:24.592 --> 15:25.762
- Kendall's dealing drugs.

15:25.762 --> 15:27.732
He tried to get
Michael to do the same.

15:27.732 --> 15:30.582
- I don't believe that.
- Believe it.

15:30.582 --> 15:32.672
- Do you know my son?

15:32.672 --> 15:35.692
If you knew my son, you'd know
that's just not possible.

15:38.662 --> 15:40.782
- Do you like my clock?

15:40.782 --> 15:44.692
It has a tiny camera in it,
a nanny cam.

15:44.692 --> 15:46.592
I figure with
what you hear in the news,

15:46.592 --> 15:47.692
you can't be too careful.

15:47.692 --> 15:50.722
Two nights ago, I come home

15:50.722 --> 15:55.562
and I find this on the machine.

15:55.562 --> 15:57.652
- We could make some money.
- When are you gonna get it?

15:57.652 --> 16:00.602
- I'll meet him at 4:30.
He's gonna give me eight bags.

16:00.602 --> 16:03.572
- You heard Brian Armstrong
got committed to DYS?

16:03.572 --> 16:05.622
- He's 14.
We're 11.

16:05.622 --> 16:07.582
Juvie--big difference,

16:07.582 --> 16:08.732

more than 1,000 feet

16:08.732 --> 16:11.582
away from a school.
The park's better.

16:11.582 --> 16:13.582
We only need to be
100 feet away.

16:13.582 --> 16:14.742
- What if I get busted?

16:14.742 --> 16:16.762
- My dad says
if you get caught,

16:16.762 --> 16:18.722
never admit to anything,
even to your lawyer,

16:18.722 --> 16:21.772
because they'll be stuck

19:23.652 --> 19:25.582
- Either you do or you don't.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.662
- He might work for a client
of mine.

19:26.662 --> 19:29.572
I'm not sure.

19:29.572 --> 19:30.752
- That's nice.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.632
Father and son--

19:32.632 --> 19:34.692
both work for the same guy.

19:37.622 --> 19:39.602
- I always make this mistake.

19:39.602 --> 19:41.742
I buy a new pair of shoes
for trial.

19:41.742 --> 19:44.662
They're not broken in,
and I get a blister.

19:44.662 --> 19:46.572
- Try mine.

19:48.592 --> 19:49.702
You're still
chasing the ghost of

19:49.702 --> 19:51.622
"Jimmy the grunt," aren't you?

19:51.622 --> 19:53.722
- You tried to stop me
from making that commercial.

19:53.722 --> 19:56.652
I remember.
Serves me right.

19:56.652 --> 19:59.582
- Jimmy, you've come a long way
from "Jimmy the grunt."

19:59.582 --> 20:00.692
Look, we even
have an offer here,

20:00.692 --> 20:02.782
which is a miracle.

20:02.782 --> 20:04.692
- How come
with the tobacco company

20:04.692 --> 20:08.582
you were like Don Quixote,
but here...

20:08.582 --> 20:12.772
- We had a much better case
against the tobacco company,

20:12.772 --> 20:14.722
and you know
how people love guns.

20:14.722 --> 20:16.582
- But don't you agree

20:16.582 --> 20:17.702
that these companies
are supplying criminals?

20:17.702 --> 20:19.782
- Yes.

20:19.782 --> 20:21.632
But...

20:21.632 --> 20:22.762
- But what?

20:39.632 --> 20:42.732
- Working late here with
the crazy loons we represent...

20:44.702 --> 20:48.622
I don't want gang members
getting hold of guns like these.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.762
I don't.

20:52.742 --> 20:54.782
But I'm glad I got mine.

21:10.662 --> 21:12.722
Ready?

21:12.722 --> 21:14.672
- I think.

21:14.672 --> 21:17.592
- The key is not to try
to pin him.

21:17.592 --> 21:18.692
He testifies
in all their trials.

21:18.692 --> 21:20.772
He's like a professional
witness now.

21:20.772 --> 21:22.632
- But I got to go hard, don't I?

21:22.632 --> 21:24.702
- For him,
I'd keep it under control,

21:24.702 --> 21:26.612
plus don't press for answers.

21:26.612 --> 21:28.732
Do your damage with the
questions and then cut him off.

21:28.732 --> 21:31.552
You have to cut off
the responses--he's persuasive.

21:31.552 --> 21:33.682
Stick to "yes" and "no"
as much as you can.

21:33.682 --> 21:35.612
- Okay.

21:35.612 --> 21:38.552
- Oh, you have some ink
on your face.

21:39.722 --> 21:41.782
- It seems they can search
the locker.

21:41.782 --> 21:43.632
- Without a warrant?

21:43.632 --> 21:44.742
- Comes down to
reasonable suspicion.

21:44.742 --> 21:46.612
- Which they didn't
necessarily have--

21:46.612 --> 21:47.742
the informant
has to be reliable.

21:47.742 --> 21:49.672
- The tip didn't come
from a snitch, Rebecca.

21:49.672 --> 21:51.632
It came from some kid's parent.

21:51.632 --> 21:53.682
- But there's no evidence
the principal knew the parent,

21:53.682 --> 21:56.742
which means she has no basis
to determine his reliability.

21:56.742 --> 21:59.632
Also, on the tape,
Kendall said that it was bad

21:59.632 --> 22:00.752
to have drugs near the schools.

22:00.752 --> 22:02.742
That would go against
suspicion of a locker.

22:02.742 --> 22:04.762
- The tape isn't relevant
to probable cause.

22:04.762 --> 22:07.552
The principal didn't even
know about the tape

22:07.552 --> 22:08.652
when she okayed the search.

22:08.652 --> 22:10.552
She was just acting
on what the parent said.

22:10.552 --> 22:11.692
- And she didn't know
the parents.

22:11.692 --> 22:13.642
- Which means they wobble
on reliability.

22:13.642 --> 22:15.742
I think Rebecca's right.
We could shut this down.

22:15.742 --> 22:17.712
- All right,
the D.A. is Steve Bennett.

22:17.712 --> 22:20.782
Helen agreed to talk to him.
I'm on my way to see her.

22:20.782 --> 22:23.772
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

22:23.772 --> 22:26.652
I'll have a better chance
without you there.

22:29.732 --> 22:34.592
- The idea that we market
to criminals is an absolute lie.

22:34.592 --> 22:36.652
- Your ads do show young men
with guns.

22:36.652 --> 22:38.602
- As do ads for trucks.

22:38.602 --> 22:40.622
We shoot for
a rugged demographic.

22:40.622 --> 22:41.782
To say that means "criminal"

22:41.782 --> 22:44.662
is irresponsible
if not repugnant.

22:44.662 --> 22:46.562
- Okay, but Mr. Hyde,

22:46.562 --> 22:48.632
you don't deny sometimes
your company's products

22:48.632 --> 22:49.712
fall into the hands of people

22:49.712 --> 22:51.772
who use them
for criminal purposes?

22:51.772 --> 22:53.642
- Look, we comply with

22:53.642 --> 22:56.672
every federal and state
safety regulation--

22:56.672 --> 22:58.672
every distribution regulation.

22:58.672 --> 23:00.612
What more can we do?

23:00.612 --> 23:01.702
This is the equivalent

23:01.702 --> 23:03.582
of holding
Ford Motor Company liable

23:03.582 --> 23:05.642
because somebody
buys one of their Broncos

23:05.642 --> 23:07.572
and runs over people.

23:07.572 --> 23:10.582
- I guess their argument
would be it's more foreseeable

23:10.582 --> 23:12.632
that a gun would end up
in the wrong hands

23:12.632 --> 23:13.652
than a Bronco.

23:13.652 --> 23:15.582
- And I don't dispute that,

23:15.582 --> 23:18.622
but nor can we control the chain
of custody of our product

23:18.622 --> 23:20.562
after we sell it.

23:20.562 --> 23:23.612
A lot of these guns
used in crimes are stolen.

23:23.612 --> 23:25.592
- You're familiar
with recent studies showing

23:25.592 --> 23:27.752
that almost half the handguns
used in crimes

23:27.752 --> 23:30.582
are legally bought
from licensed dealers?

23:30.582 --> 23:32.572
- Oh, I'm aware of the studies.

23:32.572 --> 23:33.702
I don't agree with the data.

23:33.702 --> 23:35.672
- But you're aware
that these studies show

23:35.672 --> 23:37.752
these guns are bought
by straw purchasers

23:37.752 --> 23:40.572
for people
who can't legally buy them?

23:40.572 --> 23:42.612
- Objection. He's trying
to introduce studies

23:42.612 --> 23:43.762
and research as evidence.

23:43.762 --> 23:47.582
- Sustained.
The jury will disregard it.

23:47.582 --> 23:49.662
Mr. Berluti, that's enough.

23:56.722 --> 23:58.772
- This your ad for the TAC-10?

23:58.772 --> 24:01.582
- Yes.
One of the elements--

24:01.582 --> 24:03.552
- There's no question
before you, sir.

24:03.552 --> 24:04.702
Is it your testimony
that you do not

24:04.702 --> 24:06.652
try to advertise to people

24:06.652 --> 24:08.692
who might use your guns
for criminal purposes?

24:08.692 --> 24:11.602
- That is my testimony.

24:11.602 --> 24:12.772
- Referring to an advertisement

24:12.772 --> 24:14.732
running in this month's
"Soldier of Fortune" magazine

24:14.732 --> 24:18.612
talking about the TAC-10,
does it represent the weapon

24:18.612 --> 24:20.632
to have excellent resistance
to fingerprints?

24:20.632 --> 24:21.732
- There's a context to the--

24:21.732 --> 24:23.602
- It's a yes-or-no
question, sir.

24:23.602 --> 24:25.592
Does the advertisement
represent the weapon

24:25.592 --> 24:27.762
to have excellent resistance
to fingerprints?

24:27.762 --> 24:29.732
- Yes, but there--
- Thank you.

24:29.732 --> 24:31.742
You testified
that you follow all state

24:31.742 --> 24:33.612
and federal regulations

24:33.612 --> 24:34.712
with respect to distribution,
did you not?

24:34.712 --> 24:35.782
- Yes.

24:35.782 --> 24:38.652
- Again,
this is a yes-or-no question.

24:38.652 --> 24:41.672
Does your company ever
sell gun kits through the mail?

24:41.672 --> 24:44.552
- Yes, but--
- You've answered the question.

24:44.552 --> 24:47.582
Sir, my understanding
of a gun kit--

24:47.582 --> 24:49.592
it's not
considered legally a gun

24:49.592 --> 24:51.732
since it doesn't
include a receiver.

24:51.732 --> 24:53.652
Would my understanding
be correct?

24:53.652 --> 24:54.762
- Yes.

24:54.762 --> 24:56.612
- And since
it's not legally a gun,

24:56.612 --> 24:58.562
no background checks
are necessary.

24:58.562 --> 25:00.692
A convicted felon could order
these kits through the mail.

25:00.692 --> 25:02.602
Would that be true?
- Yes.

25:02.602 --> 25:04.782
- Do you also advertise
something called a frame flat

25:04.782 --> 25:06.732
which can be bent
into a receiver?

25:06.732 --> 25:09.582
- The context of that--
- It's a yes-or-no question.

25:09.582 --> 25:11.552
- Your Honor, I object.
- Overruled.

25:11.552 --> 25:12.782
- He should be allowed
to finish his answers.

25:12.782 --> 25:15.682
- He's being asked
yes-or-no questions.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.692
The objection is overruled.

25:19.592 --> 25:21.622
- Your company
advertises these frame flats.

25:21.622 --> 25:23.562
True or not true?
- True.

25:23.562 --> 25:26.552
- You also supply your customers
with an 800 telephone number

25:26.552 --> 25:27.742
they can call for assistance

25:27.742 --> 25:29.772
in how to make a frame flat
into a receiver?

25:29.772 --> 25:33.592
- We have an 800 number
that offers general assistance.

25:33.592 --> 25:35.722
- Assistance including
how to turn a frame flat

25:35.722 --> 25:37.572
into a receiver?

25:37.572 --> 25:39.642
- Yes.
- If I were a convicted felon

25:39.642 --> 25:42.652
and I wanted a gun,
to avoid a background check,

25:42.652 --> 25:44.572
I could order
one of your gun kits,

25:44.572 --> 25:46.732
order a frame flat,
call you up,

25:46.732 --> 25:49.712
and you'd help me
make the receiver.

25:49.712 --> 25:51.782
- There are a lot
of law-abiding people,

25:51.782 --> 25:54.562
Mr. Berluti,

25:54.562 --> 25:57.752
who enjoy making their own guns.

25:57.752 --> 26:01.562
- Sure.

26:01.562 --> 26:02.742
Okay.

26:07.602 --> 26:08.722
- Why do you advertise

26:08.722 --> 26:10.752
that the gun has
a resistance to fingerprints?

26:10.752 --> 26:12.772
- Well,
it refers to the moisture

26:12.772 --> 26:14.652
and oils on the hand,

26:14.652 --> 26:17.572
a moisture that can
corrode the metal.

26:17.572 --> 26:18.712
We're talking about a finish

26:18.712 --> 26:21.562
that goes to the gun's
wear and tear.

26:21.562 --> 26:22.752
It has nothing to do

26:22.752 --> 26:25.742
with avoiding
police fingerprint detection.

26:25.742 --> 26:28.682
- Thank you.

26:28.682 --> 26:30.652
- Your ad doesn't read,

26:30.652 --> 26:33.712
"resistance to moisture
which causes corrosion."

26:33.712 --> 26:36.632
It reads, "resistance
to fingerprints," right?

26:38.632 --> 26:40.602
- Yes.

26:40.602 --> 26:42.572
- He's willing to continue
without a finding--

26:42.572 --> 26:43.682
one year probation.

26:43.682 --> 26:45.602
But if you move
for a suppression hearing,

26:45.602 --> 26:46.782
then he's gonna recommend
a delinquent finding.

26:46.782 --> 26:48.682
- Oh, come on.

26:48.682 --> 26:50.682
- Bobby, they can make intent
with this kid.

26:50.682 --> 26:52.632
They're offering probation.

26:52.632 --> 26:53.762
- All I'm asking is
that they don't pull the offer

26:53.762 --> 26:55.662
if we challenge the search.

26:55.662 --> 26:56.722
- It's policy.
I--

26:56.722 --> 26:58.602
- It's Eugene's son.

26:58.602 --> 27:01.552
- I understand, but Bobby,

27:01.552 --> 27:02.752
if we ever did that
for you or Eugene--

27:02.752 --> 27:05.762
Come on,
you know how this goes.

27:05.762 --> 27:07.672
Why are you even blinking?

27:07.672 --> 27:10.722
Just take the no finding
and probation and be thankful.

27:22.552 --> 27:23.572
- [clears throat]

27:23.572 --> 27:25.592
I'm here to see Eugene.

27:25.592 --> 27:27.742
- And you would be?

27:27.742 --> 27:30.562
- Charles Best.

27:30.562 --> 27:32.562
Eugene paged me.

27:34.562 --> 27:36.652
Hey, Eugene.
What's up?

27:39.712 --> 27:40.712
- Thanks.

27:45.712 --> 27:48.632
You still got Robby G
running for you?

27:48.632 --> 27:50.702
- Why?

27:50.702 --> 27:51.772
Is he in trouble again?

27:51.772 --> 27:55.632
- I just need to know.

27:55.632 --> 27:58.592
You can tell me.
I'm your lawyer.

28:00.772 --> 28:04.652
- Yeah, he's still
on the payroll.

28:04.652 --> 28:07.642
Now, are you
gonna tell me what's--

28:07.642 --> 28:09.582
- Robby G hooked up with my son.

28:09.582 --> 28:10.692
You in the school business,
Charlie?

28:10.692 --> 28:12.582
- Come on, let me go.
- As of right now,

28:12.582 --> 28:13.672
you're out of the school
business, you hear me?

28:13.672 --> 28:14.732
- Eugene?
- I need a second.

28:14.732 --> 28:16.642
If I get the slightest whiff

28:16.642 --> 28:18.622
you're anywhere near
a school, privilege or no,

28:18.622 --> 28:21.622
I'm going straight to the cops
with everything I got on you.

28:22.682 --> 28:23.702
Now, get out!

28:33.732 --> 28:35.582
- 375?

28:35.582 --> 28:37.562
- It's better
than we ever hoped.

28:37.562 --> 28:39.632
- Susan, Doug, I know...

28:39.632 --> 28:42.562
I know how much
you want that public verdict,

28:42.562 --> 28:43.722
but you have to remember,
in the beginning,

28:43.722 --> 28:46.642
our goal was to do well enough
to force an offer.

28:46.642 --> 28:48.632
We're here.
We got a great offer.

28:48.632 --> 28:50.762
You're in debt.
You can use this money.

28:50.762 --> 28:53.562
Trust me. I'm not thinking
about our contingency here.

28:53.562 --> 28:54.632
I'm thinking of you.

28:54.632 --> 28:56.712
- And I don't doubt that,
Lindsay,

28:56.712 --> 28:58.762
but we keep thinking of Lisa.

29:03.782 --> 29:06.622
- Tell you what--we still
have closing arguments.

29:06.622 --> 29:07.782
I don't think
the offer's going anywhere.

29:07.782 --> 29:09.782
We'll see where we are
after summations.

29:09.782 --> 29:12.702
- Okay.
Okay.

29:12.702 --> 29:14.722
Sorry to be doing this to you.

29:14.722 --> 29:18.612
- This is your case,
Mr. Kimbro, not ours.

29:18.612 --> 29:19.692
- Yeah.

29:24.602 --> 29:26.602
- Jimmy, I hate
to put pressure on you,
