WEBVTT

00:01.184 --> 00:03.892
Go in there and live
the character's life

00:03.892 --> 00:06.215
from your heart and don't care.

00:06.215 --> 00:08.915
Don't care about results.

00:08.915 --> 00:11.470
And, there's a difference because 90%

00:11.470 --> 00:13.673
of the actor's will be
needy little actors.

00:13.673 --> 00:14.964
Oh, I want, I want.

00:14.964 --> 00:15.848
I need, I need.

00:15.848 --> 00:17.345
Give me, give me now.

00:17.345 --> 00:18.982
And, you go in there,
and you don't give a shit

00:18.982 --> 00:19.996
about any of that.

00:19.996 --> 00:22.143
You're completely
dedicated to the character.

00:22.143 --> 00:23.344
That's what you have to do.

00:23.344 --> 00:26.475
Okay, get your scripts and
be back here in 30 minutes.

00:26.475 --> 00:29.358
♫ I did no wrong

00:29.358 --> 00:32.530
♫ I was young

00:32.530 --> 00:36.030
♫ I wandered like a child

00:37.054 --> 00:40.005
♫ I would do anything

00:40.005 --> 00:42.396
♫ To have you come back

00:42.396 --> 00:46.490
♫ Come back to me and smile

00:46.490 --> 00:48.357
I'm trying to decide
between Johnson and Jags.

00:48.357 --> 00:49.274
I'm unsure.

00:51.309 --> 00:52.265
What are you?

00:52.265 --> 00:53.098
300.

00:55.654 --> 00:58.765
I mean your real name
Scottie Johnson is cool too.

00:58.765 --> 01:02.970
But, I feel like Jags
is more from an actor.

01:02.970 --> 01:06.315
You change your name and
come out to my show tonight.,

01:06.315 --> 01:07.148
Okay.

01:07.148 --> 01:07.981
It's at eight.

01:07.981 --> 01:08.814
Sweet.

01:08.814 --> 01:09.647
There'll be some free beer there.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.328
No, no.

01:12.161 --> 01:12.994
Come on.

01:12.994 --> 01:13.827
No.

01:15.077 --> 01:17.180
Let me give you, just five.

01:17.180 --> 01:19.532
Man, I'll put you on the
guest list if you promise

01:19.532 --> 01:20.857
to come out.

01:20.857 --> 01:22.097
I'm gonna try and make it.

01:22.097 --> 01:23.902
No, I've got something going on later,

01:23.902 --> 01:25.165
but if you want to go to that, I'm coming.

01:25.165 --> 01:25.998
I'll be there.

01:25.998 --> 01:26.831
Free beer.

01:26.831 --> 01:27.664
It's good to see you.

01:27.664 --> 01:29.407
I like Jag.

01:29.407 --> 01:31.962
♫ I had enemies

01:31.962 --> 01:34.379
♫ I needed water

01:34.379 --> 01:38.546
♫ I needed to spend some time with the sky

01:39.640 --> 01:42.275
♫ Have mercy on me

01:42.275 --> 01:45.231
♫ Have mercy on me

01:45.231 --> 01:49.398
♫ When you hear that trumpet blow

01:50.233 --> 01:52.783
♫ Have mercy on me

01:52.783 --> 01:53.657
♫ Have mercy on me

01:54.635 --> 01:56.375
Yeah I talked to him
like a couple months ago

01:56.375 --> 01:57.208
or something like that.

01:57.208 --> 01:58.041
He's in New Orleans, right?

01:58.041 --> 01:58.874
Yes, he is.

01:58.874 --> 02:00.839
He's in New Orleans, and
he's really killing it, man.

02:00.839 --> 02:03.185
Like, he just booked his second TV series.

02:05.351 --> 02:06.184
Gross, man.

02:06.184 --> 02:08.649
I'm sorry, something in it.

02:08.649 --> 02:09.518
Yeah.

02:09.518 --> 02:12.054
Well dude, you should move out there.

02:12.054 --> 02:13.349
You'd do really well for yourself.

02:13.349 --> 02:15.120
Austin's more my speed,
you know what I mean?

02:15.120 --> 02:16.571
Yeah, I hear that.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.412
Yeah man, I'm working on this doc

02:18.412 --> 02:20.430
about Rastafarianism
and everything, right?

02:20.430 --> 02:21.943
But, here's the thing.

02:21.943 --> 02:23.884
I don't want to go to Jamaica.

02:23.884 --> 02:26.782
I could stay here in Austin, kick back,

02:26.782 --> 02:28.995
nail a couple Skype
interviews, UVU whatever?

02:28.995 --> 02:30.745
Call it a day, dunzo.

02:31.666 --> 02:33.053
Look I gotta run.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.590
I gotta make a call, but it was
great seeing you, all right?

02:34.590 --> 02:36.703
Cool man, we can talk
about the Rastafarianisms.

02:36.703 --> 02:39.682
Yeah, all right man,
good luck with that band.

02:39.682 --> 02:40.682
Doc, yeah.

02:42.628 --> 02:46.004
Dick Nacho's agency, this
is Dick Nacho speaking.

02:47.922 --> 02:49.682
Scottie, I told you time and time again,

02:49.682 --> 02:52.797
get to NOLA, that's where all the work is.

02:54.691 --> 02:56.527
Nothing right now my man.

02:56.527 --> 02:57.790
But, don't worry.

02:57.790 --> 02:59.171
Be patient, okay?

02:59.171 --> 03:02.754
I'm keenly keeping my
eyes on a few things.

03:03.748 --> 03:06.524
All right, I'll call you later.

03:06.524 --> 03:09.066
I did a commercial
audition in Dallas one time.

03:09.066 --> 03:11.385
You know there was like
eight people in there.

03:11.385 --> 03:12.249
I did really good.

03:12.249 --> 03:14.404
I said, "Hey I have a
chance of getting this job."

03:14.404 --> 03:15.403
Didn't worry about it.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.576
Didn't get the job.

03:16.576 --> 03:18.232
Didn't think about it till the next time

03:18.232 --> 03:21.476
I went up there to that
same casting director.

03:21.476 --> 03:23.976
She said, "Hey Gordon, you
know remember a few weeks ago,

03:23.976 --> 03:25.587
"we had that commercial audition?"

03:25.587 --> 03:26.420
I said, "Yeah."

03:26.420 --> 03:27.417
"Well you did really good, man.

03:27.417 --> 03:28.990
"In fact everybody in
the room said you were

03:28.990 --> 03:32.272
"by far the best actor except
for one guy, the client.

03:32.272 --> 03:34.420
"You reminded him of his brother-in-law,

03:34.420 --> 03:36.088
"so we couldn't cast you."

03:36.088 --> 03:38.459
How would you ever know
anything like that?

03:38.459 --> 03:41.127
And, how can you control
something that arbitrary.

03:41.127 --> 03:41.960
You can't.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.213
So you don't worry about it.

03:43.213 --> 03:45.651
You live the character's
life and leave it to God.

03:45.651 --> 03:47.449
Don't give a shit about anything else.

03:47.449 --> 03:49.958
That's who they want to
cast is somebody that is

03:49.958 --> 03:51.222
the character.

03:51.222 --> 03:52.889
So get your scripts.

03:53.807 --> 03:55.528
Go out there, learn
something, and come back,

03:55.528 --> 03:56.745
and do it in 30 minutes.

03:56.745 --> 03:59.032
And, it better be good.

03:59.032 --> 04:00.176
Scottie!

04:00.176 --> 04:01.009
Gordon.

04:01.009 --> 04:02.264
Good to see you.

04:02.264 --> 04:04.778
Good to see you too.

04:04.778 --> 04:05.902
Got your money.

04:05.902 --> 04:07.146
Thanks for the help the other day.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.530
Nah, they wanted someone from LA.

04:09.530 --> 04:10.964
That's the usual horseshit.

04:10.964 --> 04:11.837
Come over here, I want
to show you something.

04:11.837 --> 04:13.176
Sit down.

04:13.176 --> 04:16.199
They're shooting 50 movies
in New Orleans this year.

04:16.199 --> 04:17.803
They're shooting like 10
here and maybe two of 'em

04:17.803 --> 04:19.720
are gonna pay anything.

04:20.589 --> 04:22.877
I mean come on, man.

04:22.877 --> 04:24.563
Go to New Orleans, build up your resume,

04:24.563 --> 04:25.824
then maybe go to LA.

04:25.824 --> 04:27.108
What the hell?

04:27.108 --> 04:28.305
How much you pay for rent?

04:28.305 --> 04:29.221
800.

04:29.221 --> 04:31.140
You have a nice place?

04:31.140 --> 04:31.973
I don't know.

04:31.973 --> 04:32.806
It's a

04:32.806 --> 04:33.639
Look at this.

04:33.639 --> 04:34.809
tiny bedroom, two shitty roommates.

04:34.809 --> 04:37.890
1,000 square feet for $500 a month,

04:37.890 --> 04:39.418
and it's in the heart
of the French Quarter

04:39.418 --> 04:41.050
surrounded by fucking culture.

04:41.050 --> 04:43.395
I'd be gone if I was your age.

04:43.395 --> 04:45.491
Man, you're the best actor I ever coached,

04:45.491 --> 04:47.626
and I just don't want to see it wasted.

04:47.626 --> 04:50.738
If I'm gonna make it, I
can make it here, you know?

04:50.738 --> 04:53.007
Hey what do you think about my new name?

04:53.007 --> 04:53.840
Check this out.

04:55.727 --> 04:57.669
Oh God, Scottie Jags?

04:57.669 --> 04:58.575
Yeah.

04:58.575 --> 05:00.317
Great name for a porn star.

05:02.078 --> 05:03.404
What's wrong with Johnson.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.237
I don't know.

05:04.237 --> 05:07.959
I feel like I need something
that pops more, you know?

05:10.484 --> 05:11.637
I'll tell you why.

05:11.637 --> 05:12.940
Look at this girl.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.202
Oh my God, I met this girl
at the snow cone stand.

05:14.202 --> 05:15.937
We've been dating for like three months.

05:15.937 --> 05:16.770
Oh Lord, not another one.

05:16.770 --> 05:17.635
She's so cute.

05:17.635 --> 05:18.468
Look at this.

05:18.468 --> 05:19.301
They're all cute.

05:19.301 --> 05:20.134
I mean seriously.

05:20.134 --> 05:21.442
And, they're
all about the same age.

05:21.442 --> 05:22.618
Is that girl even legal?

05:22.618 --> 05:23.863
Yes, she's 20.

05:23.863 --> 05:24.696
How old is she?

05:24.696 --> 05:25.529
She's 20.

05:26.379 --> 05:27.308
30.

05:27.308 --> 05:28.542
Little louder, didn't hear you.

05:28.542 --> 05:29.375
30.

05:30.945 --> 05:33.266
Support a family bartending
the rest of your life?

05:33.266 --> 05:35.102
The hours don't work for having a baby.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.895
You gotta make some money if you're gonna

05:36.895 --> 05:39.424
move ahead with any of these women.

05:39.424 --> 05:42.454
All right, you wanna stick
around and do a scene?

05:42.454 --> 05:44.244
No, I'm not really
in the right headspace

05:44.244 --> 05:45.077
right now.

05:45.077 --> 05:46.227
Well watch a few anyway.

05:46.227 --> 05:47.400
There're some good actors here.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.862
Maybe you can find somebody
for your web series.

05:50.862 --> 05:51.931
Yeah, I'll stick around.

05:51.931 --> 05:53.737
I did a porn film once.

05:54.570 --> 05:56.376
But, my part was so small.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:06.504 --> 06:07.448
Hey.

06:09.188 --> 06:11.603
I saw your web series.

06:11.603 --> 06:13.022
I really dig your work.

06:13.022 --> 06:14.696
Thank you.

06:14.696 --> 06:16.408
I heard you coach some.

06:16.408 --> 06:17.359
No, I'm not a coach.

06:17.359 --> 06:19.451
I just love acting so I help friends out

06:19.451 --> 06:20.284
when I can.

06:20.284 --> 06:21.697
But, I'm not a coach.

06:21.697 --> 06:23.327
Well you know I got
this really great part.

06:23.327 --> 06:25.239
And, I could always use an extra eye.

06:25.239 --> 06:28.659
I'd even like pay you if you're into that.

06:28.659 --> 06:30.000
Sure, yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.744
I mean you don't have to
pay me, but if you have

06:32.744 --> 06:36.580
some extra cash to throw, that'd be cool.

06:37.862 --> 06:39.240
I need you for one scene.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.073
Sure yeah.

06:46.141 --> 06:47.891
The results are in.

06:49.580 --> 06:51.913
Tomorrow you're gonna die.

06:54.288 --> 06:55.955
It's the only way.

07:02.573 --> 07:03.406
Okay.

07:08.027 --> 07:08.860
Okay.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.342
Cut.

07:21.135 --> 07:23.454
Are you sure
it's setting people up?

07:23.454 --> 07:25.350
I don't exactly know.

07:25.350 --> 07:26.868
It's what he seemed to be hinting towards.

07:26.868 --> 07:28.116
It's a good way to get
yourself fucking killed.

07:28.116 --> 07:29.248
You know that right?

07:29.248 --> 07:31.320
Look I'm fine.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.948
I don't need your help.

07:33.948 --> 07:36.752
Like I'm gonna let
you do this on your own.

07:36.752 --> 07:40.305
You'll get kidnapped,
raped, beat to death,

07:40.305 --> 07:42.555
and then fed to sewer rats.

07:43.950 --> 07:46.450
You, you go back to Yazu City.

07:48.494 --> 07:49.327
All right, cut.

07:49.327 --> 07:51.623
I think we can stop the scene right there.

07:51.623 --> 07:54.219
So what'd you think about my energy.

07:54.219 --> 07:55.052
Is it good?

07:55.052 --> 07:57.181
Yeah it's really good.

07:57.181 --> 07:58.822
Why don't you try it with
like an accent or something?

07:58.822 --> 07:59.822
Yeah okay.

08:02.283 --> 08:04.355
Forget about the camera and everything

08:04.355 --> 08:05.357
and just do your lines.

08:05.357 --> 08:06.338
Like don't even worry about mine.

08:06.338 --> 08:08.671
Just give me the energy, go.

08:09.644 --> 08:11.389
I don't exactly know.

08:11.389 --> 08:13.040
It's just my hunch.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.716
It's what he seemed to be hinting towards.

08:14.716 --> 08:15.549
Give it to me now.

08:15.549 --> 08:16.382
Give for power.

08:16.382 --> 08:17.309
I don't exactly know.

08:17.309 --> 08:18.424
It's just my hunch.

08:18.424 --> 08:20.583
It's what he seemed to be hinting towards.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.074
It's just my hunch.

08:22.074 --> 08:23.541
It's what he seemed to be hinting towards.

08:23.541 --> 08:24.374
Good.

08:28.137 --> 08:29.170
What are you doing?

08:29.170 --> 08:30.003
With your tongue.

08:30.836 --> 08:31.782
I don't know.

08:38.504 --> 08:39.874
Tell me it hurts again, you little bitch.

08:39.874 --> 08:40.707
Yeah it really hurts.

08:40.707 --> 08:41.897
But, it hurts so good, right?

08:43.246 --> 08:46.496
Yeah, I can see you need a safe word.

08:48.264 --> 08:50.967
Yeah just like that, get it.

08:50.967 --> 08:52.149
Bite my toe!

08:52.149 --> 08:53.215
Bite me, you little bitch.

08:53.215 --> 08:54.305
Get it.

08:54.305 --> 08:55.273
Harder.

08:57.091 --> 08:58.149
Whoa, baby!

09:00.249 --> 09:01.103
Baby, we were just rehearsing.

09:03.207 --> 09:04.409
You piece of shit.

09:04.409 --> 09:05.494
Fucking asshole!

09:14.503 --> 09:17.253
I was just rehearsing.

09:18.919 --> 09:21.307
♫ I'm so lonesome

09:21.307 --> 09:25.706
♫ I'm gonna hang my head and cry

09:25.706 --> 09:28.373
♫ Cry, cry, cry

09:30.910 --> 09:32.402
♫ Cry, cry, cry

09:44.044 --> 09:45.794
Let's all check in.

09:47.072 --> 09:49.171
Just go ahead and call out
an injuries you're having

09:49.171 --> 09:50.537
right now.

09:56.341 --> 09:57.643
Got it.

09:57.643 --> 10:00.145
I love what you're doing.

10:00.145 --> 10:01.552
Now see how everyone, if you can look,

10:01.552 --> 10:02.677
Maria's flexing her feet.

10:02.677 --> 10:04.725
Let's try to really flex the feet.

10:04.725 --> 10:07.235
Yeah, lift up a little bit.

10:07.235 --> 10:12.028
Let's think of the Indians
while we're in bow pose.

10:17.172 --> 10:18.005
Good breathing.

10:18.005 --> 10:20.218
I like that breathing.

10:20.218 --> 10:21.725
Oh shit, okay everyone just hold a minute.

10:21.725 --> 10:22.787
I'll be right back.

10:22.787 --> 10:25.865
Let's just rest in child's pose.

10:25.865 --> 10:27.259
What the fuck are you doing?

10:27.259 --> 10:28.814
I'm fucking smoking a cigarette.

10:30.637 --> 10:32.011
Everyone in there knows
you're my best friend.

10:32.011 --> 10:33.372
This makes me look like an asshole.

10:33.372 --> 10:34.359
Well fuck man, I'll leave.

10:34.359 --> 10:35.203
No, don't leave.

10:35.203 --> 10:36.036
Get your ass back in class.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.536
We can talk after.

10:38.451 --> 10:40.353
Taylor left me.

10:40.353 --> 10:42.853
I got caught cheating.

10:42.853 --> 10:44.069
You idiot.

10:44.069 --> 10:44.942
I fucked up, man.

10:47.723 --> 10:48.556
She did.

10:48.556 --> 10:50.040
She sucked.

10:50.040 --> 10:50.873
Really?

10:50.873 --> 10:51.706
Yeah.

10:51.706 --> 10:52.539
I loved her.

10:52.539 --> 10:53.476
You didn't love her, man.

10:53.476 --> 10:55.638
You've told me that you
loved five girls this year.

10:55.638 --> 10:56.821
You can't love five girls in one year

10:56.821 --> 10:57.712
It's impossible.

10:57.712 --> 10:58.545
The numbers don't add up.

10:58.545 --> 10:59.650
Get you ass back in class.

10:59.650 --> 11:00.910
I'm pretty sure I loved her.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.377
You didn't love her, trust me.

11:02.377 --> 11:03.416
We'll talk later, okay?

11:03.416 --> 11:05.416
I'm sorry that happened.

11:10.451 --> 11:12.112
Okay so I give him tea.

11:12.112 --> 11:14.118
I get back in the car, pull out.

11:14.118 --> 11:16.237
All of a sudden, this
hippie chick pulls up

11:16.237 --> 11:17.813
next to me, starts banging
on my, you all right?

11:17.813 --> 11:20.549
Yeah, I just gotta pee really bad.

11:20.549 --> 11:21.799
I'm about to tell you a story.

11:21.799 --> 11:22.632
I know.

11:22.632 --> 11:24.561
Is it like a five minute
story or a 10 minute story?

11:24.561 --> 11:25.978
If you gotta pee, go pee.

11:25.978 --> 11:27.005
No, no, go head.

11:27.838 --> 11:28.671
Yeah.

11:28.671 --> 11:29.504
So anyway, I get some tea.

11:29.504 --> 11:31.044
All of a sudden, this hippie
chick pulls up next to me

11:31.044 --> 11:33.633
starts banging on my
car and spits on my car.

11:33.633 --> 11:36.864
Watch what you're doing, tiny dick.

11:36.864 --> 11:37.751
You pulled in front of me.

11:37.751 --> 11:38.584
I'm confused.

11:38.584 --> 11:40.154
Why don't you just go
back to LA, all right?

11:40.154 --> 11:41.520
I'm sorry I don't know what's going on.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.612
Can you explain to me what happened?

11:42.612 --> 11:44.809
And, then all of a sudden,
her boyfriend pulls up.

11:44.809 --> 11:46.562
He starts cursing me out.

11:46.562 --> 11:48.395
I'm like, I don't know
what this is all about,

11:48.395 --> 11:51.200
but that chick is gonna get you
in a lot of fucking trouble.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.317
Actually do you wanna speak
sign language a little bit?

11:54.317 --> 11:55.912
So I kind of blacked out.

11:55.912 --> 11:57.388
I'm like what the fuck?

11:57.388 --> 11:58.635
I throw my tea at him.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.115
Next thing I know, he's throwing
his water canteen at me.

12:01.115 --> 12:04.103
She's crying, bawling crying.

12:04.103 --> 12:06.249
Don't drink water if you have to pee.

12:06.249 --> 12:07.120
Okay.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.701
Then she tells she's called the cops.

12:08.701 --> 12:10.046
I'm like the fucking cops?

12:10.046 --> 12:10.996
These are breasts.

12:10.996 --> 12:11.829
Call the fucking cops!

12:11.829 --> 12:13.177
This is how you were raised.

12:13.177 --> 12:14.182
Fucking call the fucking cops.

12:14.182 --> 12:15.110
From your mother.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.550
Milk to you, and then you
throw a fucking bottle at me?

12:19.458 --> 12:20.718
I'm gonna tell them what you did.

12:20.718 --> 12:22.397
I'm gonna say he was violent.

12:22.397 --> 12:23.973
Babe, just call the fucking cops!

12:25.206 --> 12:27.188
Do you think I
was in the wrong for that?

12:28.715 --> 12:29.745
They are cyclists.

12:29.745 --> 12:30.946
Yeah they got the right of way.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.044
Yeah definitely.

12:34.044 --> 12:34.877
I felt bad.

12:34.877 --> 12:35.710
I couldn't sleep that night.

12:35.710 --> 12:36.543
Yeah, of course I'm gonna
have some thoughts on that

12:36.543 --> 12:38.370
when I get back.

12:38.370 --> 12:39.203
Okay.

13:07.807 --> 13:08.833
I just peed.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.506
Yeah you gotta pee sometimes.

13:10.506 --> 13:12.423
Yeah it was just pee.

13:15.946 --> 13:18.940
Try an apple cider vinegar.

13:20.427 --> 13:22.252
It's apple cider vinegar.

13:22.252 --> 13:23.183
No, I'm good.

13:23.183 --> 13:25.739
Cause it's good for you.

13:29.703 --> 13:31.324
Oh man.

13:31.324 --> 13:32.601
What happened with that girl you were,

13:32.601 --> 13:33.434
she heard about--

13:33.434 --> 13:34.792
No, she walked in on me.

13:34.792 --> 13:35.805
She walked in on you?

13:35.805 --> 13:37.524
Yeah, I'm just banging this chick

13:37.524 --> 13:39.826
in all these crazy ass positions, dude.

13:39.826 --> 13:41.713
Like I've never even heard of or seen.

13:41.713 --> 13:42.546
It's horrible, dude.

13:42.546 --> 13:43.431
It was probably pretty scarring.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.264
That's awful.

13:44.264 --> 13:45.195
You gotta be more careful.

13:45.195 --> 13:46.028
I know.

13:46.028 --> 13:46.986
It was bad.

13:48.408 --> 13:50.793
This like Cirque du
Soleil actress chick.

13:53.003 --> 13:53.836
Damn.

13:53.836 --> 13:54.769
What?

13:54.769 --> 13:56.411
Hold on a second, I'll be right back.

14:03.374 --> 14:04.783
If not, I'm gonna be sitting over there

14:04.783 --> 14:08.151
disturbed thinking this
girl thinks I'm an idiot.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.068
I'm fine.

14:12.814 --> 14:14.226
It's nothing.

14:15.584 --> 14:16.906
It's embarrassing.

14:16.906 --> 14:17.901
Come on.

14:17.901 --> 14:19.755
I'm trying to sell my wedding ring.

14:20.879 --> 14:21.806
Engaged.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.414
Sorry to hear that.

14:24.414 --> 14:25.514
I just got out of a relationship.

14:25.514 --> 14:27.603
My girlfriend and I broke up.

14:27.603 --> 14:28.676
I'm so sorry.

14:28.676 --> 14:30.434
Yeah, thank you.

14:33.198 --> 14:35.460
I don't know probably like
watch a movie or something

14:35.460 --> 14:36.293
like that.

14:37.857 --> 14:40.113
Oh classic comedy movies usually.

14:41.847 --> 14:43.343
Yeah I love Palm Beach Story.

14:43.343 --> 14:44.678
You like Sturges?

14:44.678 --> 14:46.206
I love Sturges.

14:49.074 --> 14:49.907
I haven't.

14:50.740 --> 14:51.576
We should watch it.

14:51.576 --> 14:52.409
You wanna watch it?

14:52.409 --> 14:53.242
We can do it tonight.

14:53.242 --> 14:54.075
I can't.

14:54.075 --> 14:55.100
Tomorrow night.

14:55.100 --> 14:55.974
I have work early.

14:55.974 --> 14:57.434
The night after that.

14:59.919 --> 15:01.002
Sure.

15:02.880 --> 15:03.713
Call me.

15:06.396 --> 15:07.729
I'll call you.

15:10.620 --> 15:12.032
This chick is rich.

15:20.232 --> 15:21.863
You didn't have to do that.

15:21.863 --> 15:22.696
Well I wanted to.

15:22.696 --> 15:24.797
I figured you could
use 'em since you might

15:24.797 --> 15:27.276
not be getting 'em for
awhile 'cause you're single

15:27.276 --> 15:30.276
'cause the marriage didn't work out.

15:39.702 --> 15:41.622
It's so cute.

15:43.088 --> 15:45.724
Yeah, it's just so sweet the way

15:45.724 --> 15:47.253
she stands up for her man like that.

15:47.253 --> 15:49.244
It's so beautiful.

15:49.244 --> 15:50.552
I know it's Sturges.

15:50.552 --> 15:52.185
I mean he's the best.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.352
He's the best.

15:54.473 --> 15:57.232
Do you want to hug or something?

15:57.232 --> 15:58.065
Sure.

16:05.417 --> 16:06.750
Are you serious?

16:08.112 --> 16:09.589
First date?

16:09.589 --> 16:10.510
I'm sorry.

16:10.510 --> 16:13.540
I'm usually way more respectful.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.304
Sure you are.

16:15.304 --> 16:17.331
It's called self control.

16:17.331 --> 16:19.529
Why do I get the feeling
you don't have any?

16:19.529 --> 16:20.853
No, no I'm sorry.

16:20.853 --> 16:23.005
I think it's time for you to go home.

16:24.847 --> 16:25.854
Look I'm enjoying this.

16:25.854 --> 16:26.820
I shouldn't of kissed you.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.248
No, I just have work early tomorrow.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.335
Yeah.

16:33.335 --> 16:34.806
Call me.

16:34.806 --> 16:35.639
Okay.

16:37.437 --> 16:38.965
I just hope I didn't fuck it up.

16:40.382 --> 16:42.235
No, she said I could call her.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.552
Straighten your arms like this, breathe.

16:45.552 --> 16:47.899
It's a confidence pose.

16:47.899 --> 16:49.220
How do you feel about this girl?

16:49.220 --> 16:50.803
I don't know.

16:50.803 --> 16:54.130
She's really sweet, but she's a good girl.

16:54.130 --> 16:55.454
That's new for you.

16:55.454 --> 16:56.830
What?

16:56.830 --> 16:58.816
I don't know if you realize,
but every time you meet

16:58.816 --> 17:00.581
a new chick, you come over here saying

17:00.581 --> 17:02.043
I'm gonna marry this girl.

17:02.043 --> 17:03.164
This is very new for you.

17:03.164 --> 17:05.920
Well I'm just worried that
she's too innocent for me.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.387
I think she might be a virgin, dude.

17:07.387 --> 17:09.548
And, she's 25 years old.

17:09.548 --> 17:11.117
She might be 28 years old.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.406
I doubt she's a virgin
just 'cause she won't

17:12.406 --> 17:14.077
let you bang her on the first night.

17:14.077 --> 17:17.482
I mean I think you need to
just relax a little bit.

17:17.482 --> 17:18.493
Try to have a little faith.

17:18.493 --> 17:20.522
Get to know her, take your time.

17:20.522 --> 17:25.332
You know it can be very
healthy to go against type.

17:25.332 --> 17:27.541
Okay listen up.

17:27.541 --> 17:29.816
The word on the street is Moses Duval

17:29.816 --> 17:30.672
No shit.

17:30.672 --> 17:33.181
is headed to town to
shoot his new feature film.

17:33.181 --> 17:34.789
And, he's casting only local talent.

17:34.789 --> 17:36.001
Holy shit!

17:36.001 --> 17:37.219
That's you Scottie.

17:37.219 --> 17:38.932
What you need to do is
you need to be ready,

17:38.932 --> 17:40.104
and you need to stay sharp.

17:40.104 --> 17:41.414
You gotta be read to go at all times.

17:41.414 --> 17:43.069
Stay in shape, stay sharp
because it could happen

17:43.069 --> 17:44.693
at any time, okay?

17:44.693 --> 17:46.110
Keep working out.

17:48.198 --> 17:49.924
Your web series got canceled.

17:51.115 --> 17:52.519
Not a big deal.

17:52.519 --> 17:53.745
How you doing?

17:53.745 --> 17:54.650
Fuck.

17:54.650 --> 17:55.483
Good.

17:55.483 --> 17:58.566
So let's talk about your last film.

17:59.597 --> 18:03.404
Everyone questioned you when
at the peak of your career

18:03.404 --> 18:07.154
you decided to quit
directing so that you can

18:08.166 --> 18:11.152
research for your award winning film,

18:11.152 --> 18:13.042
The Mailman of Wemberly.

18:13.042 --> 18:15.460
Is it true that you actually got a job

18:15.460 --> 18:19.314
at a post office and
decided to deliver mail

18:19.314 --> 18:20.481
for two years?

18:22.744 --> 18:24.833
What a great idea for the metaphor

18:24.833 --> 18:26.166
to be a mailman.

18:27.262 --> 18:31.145
To be, a M, A, L, E, a
male, but also M, A, I, L,

18:31.145 --> 18:33.896
mailman to be able to convey someone

18:33.896 --> 18:36.896
who delivers communication to people

18:39.879 --> 18:41.929
in the small town of Wemberly.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.108
Houston.

18:49.693 --> 18:50.526
Yeah.

18:50.526 --> 18:53.055
That's cool, you don't find that a lot.

18:53.055 --> 18:54.805
Bet your mom's a fox.

18:56.167 --> 18:57.788
Yeah she is.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.240
Yours?

18:59.240 --> 19:00.222
Your mom a fox?

19:00.222 --> 19:01.722
Yeah, of course.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.288
What do you do for a living?

19:04.288 --> 19:05.121
You got a job?

19:05.121 --> 19:08.442
I have my own butter company.

19:09.590 --> 19:10.767
You're like too perfect.

19:10.767 --> 19:13.048
You got an addiction or something?

19:13.048 --> 19:13.881
No.

19:13.881 --> 19:15.084
You're like super religious.

19:15.084 --> 19:16.043
No.

19:18.187 --> 19:22.531
Now that is something
I am not cool with.

19:22.531 --> 19:23.614
Just kidding.

19:25.416 --> 19:28.618
I have a swing dance class on
Wednesday if you want to come.

19:28.618 --> 19:30.525
Man, honestly I'm not a dancer.

19:30.525 --> 19:31.692
Okay.

19:33.233 --> 19:37.294
But, I got this pottery
class I've been dying to go to.

19:37.294 --> 19:38.377
You wanna go?

19:39.462 --> 19:40.295
Yeah.

20:08.779 --> 20:10.752
I dig you, I do.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.352
It's cool that you're an actor and all.

20:12.352 --> 20:14.312
But, I need to know this.

20:14.312 --> 20:16.258
Are you making any money acting?

20:16.258 --> 20:17.612
Yeah, yeah I am.

20:17.612 --> 20:19.464
I don't want to waste
either of our time.

20:19.464 --> 20:21.082
And, I'm not looking
to be the bread winner

20:21.082 --> 20:22.849
of the family especially if I feel

20:22.849 --> 20:24.938
the guy isn't even working.

20:24.938 --> 20:27.657
So how much money can you make acting?

20:27.657 --> 20:29.574
A lot, like millions.

20:30.816 --> 20:32.763
Well how much money
did you make last year

20:32.763 --> 20:35.149
like 20 grand, 30 grand?

20:35.149 --> 20:37.860
No, last year I made like $1,200.

20:37.860 --> 20:40.091
But, the year before
that I did a commercial.

20:40.091 --> 20:42.400
I made $3,200 in two days.

20:42.400 --> 20:46.265
They had like craft
services and filet mignon.

20:46.265 --> 20:48.621
And, I make my money bartending anyway.

20:48.621 --> 20:50.792
I don't know if I can date
someone with no ambition.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.077
At some point, I want a family.

20:53.077 --> 20:56.582
And, I'm sorry I like
you, but I don't want

20:56.582 --> 20:58.015
to go down this road again.

20:58.015 --> 20:58.913
Wait, whoa.

20:58.913 --> 21:03.402
Okay I'm like right on
the cusp of making it

21:03.402 --> 21:04.684
and breaking in.

21:04.684 --> 21:05.517
You know what I'm saying?

21:05.517 --> 21:06.350
So you got to be fair with me.

21:06.350 --> 21:07.206
You gotta give me some time.

21:07.206 --> 21:09.363
Like give me like a couple months.

21:09.363 --> 21:11.649
Well if it takes too long, I'll jet.

21:11.649 --> 21:13.558
I'm warning you.

21:13.558 --> 21:14.725
That's fair.

21:16.760 --> 21:17.593
Good.

21:17.593 --> 21:18.426
Good.

21:18.426 --> 21:19.259
Good.

21:19.259 --> 21:20.405
Cause I'm starting to like you.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.761
I like you.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.420
You wanna go in your bedroom?

21:26.420 --> 21:27.790
One more week.

21:28.918 --> 21:30.034
Can I sleep over?

21:30.034 --> 21:31.005
Not till then?

21:32.959 --> 21:33.792
Really?

21:33.792 --> 21:34.625
Yes.

21:34.625 --> 21:36.706
All right, well I'm gonna take off

21:36.706 --> 21:38.611
'cause I don't wanna get blue balls.

21:38.611 --> 21:41.854
Wait, I know a little trick for that

21:41.854 --> 21:44.021
and it involves my butter.

21:47.024 --> 21:48.050
Is that sign language?

21:48.050 --> 21:49.694
Scottie.

21:49.694 --> 21:51.548
You want a coffee enema?

21:52.381 --> 21:53.798
A coffee enema.

21:54.767 --> 21:56.728
Well I don't get the caffeine but it wakes

21:56.728 --> 21:59.318
up my intestines and cleans me out.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.573
Yeah sure, I'll take it home.

22:01.573 --> 22:03.550
Okay take it.

22:03.550 --> 22:04.914
I think I'm really into this girl.

22:05.747 --> 22:06.666
Yeah.

22:06.666 --> 22:07.626
That's beautiful.

22:07.626 --> 22:10.338
I mean the no sex thing
might be a good thing.

22:10.338 --> 22:12.188
It's making us talk a lot.

22:12.188 --> 22:13.137
That's lovely.

22:13.137 --> 22:14.007
Embrace that.

22:14.007 --> 22:16.147
I've done two years before.

22:16.147 --> 22:16.980
Really?

22:16.980 --> 22:17.813
Amazing.

22:17.813 --> 22:19.373
Yeah, I think I need
a new career though.

22:19.373 --> 22:20.228
I need to do something else.

22:20.228 --> 22:21.333
You're an actor.

22:21.333 --> 22:22.658
You've been acting for like 20 years.

22:22.658 --> 22:24.211
You can't stop acting, come on.

22:24.211 --> 22:25.766
I could try to drive
with Uber or something.

22:25.766 --> 22:27.138
Uber, how long you
gonna be happy with Uber,

22:27.138 --> 22:27.971
two months?

22:27.971 --> 22:28.804
Think long term.

22:28.804 --> 22:29.691
Scottie, you're a great actor.

22:29.691 --> 22:30.979
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:30.979 --> 22:31.812
You know I could talk.

22:31.812 --> 22:32.645
I could always cook.

22:32.645 --> 22:34.652
I could open up like a food
trailer downtown or something.

22:34.652 --> 22:35.485
I've had your food before.

22:35.485 --> 22:36.318
It's not very good.

22:36.318 --> 22:37.151
Actually you know what I'm thinking is

22:37.151 --> 22:38.456
what I could do is I
could get super jacked,

22:38.456 --> 22:40.193
I could join MMA, I
could become a fighter,

22:40.193 --> 22:42.110
and I could transfer into film

22:42.110 --> 22:44.386
kind of like Bruce Lee, the Rock.

22:44.386 --> 22:45.219
Mr. T.

22:45.219 --> 22:46.052
Mr. T.

22:46.052 --> 22:46.971
I like Mr. T.

22:46.971 --> 22:47.804
Yeah.

22:51.064 --> 22:53.432
Get down, grounded into the earth,

22:53.432 --> 22:55.358
feel it working for you.

23:11.167 --> 23:12.958
Wow check this out, dude.

23:12.958 --> 23:15.605
For his next movie, he wants to explore

23:15.605 --> 23:18.648
those who are disadvantaged in society

23:18.648 --> 23:20.893
and not of the status quo.

23:20.893 --> 23:23.819
It makes him feel grateful.

23:25.115 --> 23:27.508
I think it's about handicapped people.

23:27.508 --> 23:28.341
Look at this.

23:28.341 --> 23:29.468
Listen to this quote, all right?

23:29.468 --> 23:30.843
It is only by walking in the shoes

23:30.843 --> 23:32.177
of those less fortunate than us

23:32.177 --> 23:34.245
that we are actually
able to grasp who we are

23:34.245 --> 23:35.859
and what beauty we are surrounded by.

23:35.859 --> 23:36.926
Dude, this dude is an artist.

23:36.926 --> 23:38.722
You know this chicks
whipping you into shape, huh?

23:38.722 --> 23:39.987
Look at this picture of him, dude.

23:39.987 --> 23:42.398
He looks like he's in
the jungle or something.

23:42.398 --> 23:44.689
There's only one online.

23:44.689 --> 23:46.419
Damn, this girl is hot.

23:46.419 --> 23:47.746
Look at this, dude.

23:47.746 --> 23:49.360
That's his daughter.

23:51.153 --> 23:52.211
Look at this.

23:52.211 --> 23:53.574
Look at this girl.

23:53.574 --> 23:54.948
I think I know her.

23:54.948 --> 23:55.781
Shut up, dude.

23:55.781 --> 23:56.614
I'm serious.

23:56.614 --> 23:58.616
Yeah, she's taken my class a couple times.

23:59.632 --> 24:00.620
Are you messing with me?

24:00.620 --> 24:01.453
No.

24:02.918 --> 24:04.042
He's gonna go on a date with her.

24:04.042 --> 24:05.252
She takes his yoga class.

24:06.376 --> 24:07.473
He's gonna go on a date with her,

24:07.473 --> 24:08.851
he's gonna get in with
her, and she's gonna get

24:08.851 --> 24:10.275
me over to that house, and we get the lead

24:10.275 --> 24:11.457
fucking role in the film.

24:11.457 --> 24:14.076
Scottie, I don't think
this is gonna work?

24:14.909 --> 24:16.253
I mean Dick this is old
school Hollywood shit

24:16.253 --> 24:17.291
that I'm doing.

24:17.291 --> 24:18.751
You of all people should understand that.

24:18.751 --> 24:20.529
I'm busting my ass over here for you.

24:20.529 --> 24:22.172
Dick, what the fuck else
do you want me to do, man?

24:22.172 --> 24:23.583
I just kind of feel
like you're doing this

24:23.583 --> 24:24.418
on your own.

24:24.418 --> 24:25.616
You're going on a little solo mission,

24:25.616 --> 24:27.086
and I don't really appreciate it.

24:27.086 --> 24:29.742
Hey look, if I go to the Oscars, man,

24:29.742 --> 24:31.267
you're coming with me, bro.

24:31.267 --> 24:32.215
You're my date.

24:33.048 --> 24:36.749
We'll drive down there
together in a convertible.

24:36.749 --> 24:37.582
Okay.

24:37.582 --> 24:38.415
Throw this thing together.

24:38.415 --> 24:39.248
What can we do?

24:39.248 --> 24:40.239
What do you got, you got anything?

24:40.239 --> 24:41.752
Yes, I actually did hear something.

24:41.752 --> 24:43.410
What do you got?

24:43.410 --> 24:45.399
Sorry buddy, but it doesn't look good.

24:45.399 --> 24:46.661
It looks like they're only hiring

24:46.661 --> 24:49.587
real disadvantaged people.

24:50.420 --> 24:51.686
No, we might have a shot at getting

24:51.686 --> 24:56.163
a good supporting role,
one of those meaty, chunky,

24:56.163 --> 24:58.622
gravy supporting roles perfect for you.

24:58.622 --> 25:01.159
So stay sharp, stay ready, stay in shape.

25:01.159 --> 25:02.043
Be happy.

25:02.043 --> 25:03.665
You know what, I'm gonna let you know

25:03.665 --> 25:05.996
as soon as I hear anything.

25:05.996 --> 25:07.220
All right.

25:10.961 --> 25:12.390
You're my Dick.

25:12.390 --> 25:14.572
I am your Dick.

25:14.572 --> 25:16.535
Well you're not, yeah.

25:16.535 --> 25:17.368
Yeah.

25:20.740 --> 25:21.832
For the first half of this class,

25:21.832 --> 25:24.178
we're gonna stay in child's
pose and just relax.

25:24.178 --> 25:25.488
I just feel like there's a lot of worry

25:25.488 --> 25:27.238
happening these days.

25:28.805 --> 25:29.722
Breathe in.

25:31.057 --> 25:32.415
Inhaling.

25:35.626 --> 25:38.512
Exhaling, letting worries go.

25:38.512 --> 25:40.466
I can't relax.

25:40.466 --> 25:41.299
Exhale.

25:43.074 --> 25:45.794
Jog around the block a few times.

25:45.794 --> 25:46.953
Inhale.

25:46.953 --> 25:50.370
Good, good, I like to hear those breaths.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.113
You need to just relax.

25:56.113 --> 25:58.399
Why don't you take Ebby
on a nice date tonight?

26:00.199 --> 26:01.365
I don't know, get a bottle of wine,

26:01.365 --> 26:02.467
go to the woods.

26:06.473 --> 26:07.737
Man, I've been working so hard lately.

26:07.737 --> 26:09.445
I'll tell ya.

26:09.445 --> 26:11.139
But, I think I got a
meeting with this really big

26:11.139 --> 26:12.443
director in town.

26:12.443 --> 26:14.415
That's great, babe, I'm so proud of you.

26:14.415 --> 26:15.784
Thanks babe, yeah.

26:15.784 --> 26:17.766
Oh I'm going out of town.

26:17.766 --> 26:19.236
Would you be up for watering my plants?

26:22.072 --> 26:24.198
If that's possible.

26:24.198 --> 26:25.679
Thanks.

26:25.679 --> 26:28.523
I'm going to San Francisco trying to get

26:28.523 --> 26:30.348
my butter in the shop there.

26:30.348 --> 26:31.661
That's cool.

26:31.661 --> 26:34.904
So when you get back, we can...

26:36.317 --> 26:38.337
You know when you get back we'll...

26:39.170 --> 26:40.703
You know
what I'm talking about.

26:42.599 --> 26:44.156
Or, we just do another hand job.

26:44.156 --> 26:44.989
That's cool too.

26:44.989 --> 26:46.236
That's probably the best I've ever had.

26:46.236 --> 26:47.118
Maybe.

26:47.118 --> 26:49.595
I mean it was definitely
the best I've had

26:49.595 --> 26:51.804
from someone else.

26:51.804 --> 26:54.478
Cool, I'm glad you liked it.

26:54.478 --> 26:55.895
Give me a kiss.

26:58.970 --> 27:00.845
What are you doing now?

27:00.845 --> 27:02.697
Hey listen, did I ever
tell you about the time

27:02.697 --> 27:04.645
that I flew to Paris with Marlon Brando?

27:04.645 --> 27:05.866
With Brando?

27:08.966 --> 27:12.757
He said, "Can you
please close your window

27:12.757 --> 27:15.090
"I've asked you five times?"

27:18.035 --> 27:21.436
Fuck no, I could've represented him,

27:21.436 --> 27:22.993
but I didn't.

27:22.993 --> 27:26.410
So what does that tell you about success?

27:28.175 --> 27:31.326
Newsflash, they're only
casting transgendered people

27:31.326 --> 27:33.278
for this Moses Duval film.

27:34.497 --> 27:35.725
Don't worry about it Scottie.

27:35.725 --> 27:36.604
Not a big deal.

27:36.604 --> 27:38.791
You're gonna get the next one, okay.

27:38.791 --> 27:39.708
Stay sharp.

27:52.761 --> 27:53.721
Good game.

27:53.721 --> 27:56.961
Good game, let me see the ball.

27:59.218 --> 28:01.265
I know a transgendered person.

28:01.265 --> 28:02.098
Why?

28:04.349 --> 28:06.182
Doubtful, I can try.

28:07.224 --> 28:08.592
If you could, yeah.

28:08.592 --> 28:09.753
All right, hit me up.

28:09.753 --> 28:11.888
Why are you trying
to meet a trans person?

28:11.888 --> 28:12.773
Research.

28:12.773 --> 28:14.428
You know any?

28:14.428 --> 28:16.806
Hey your date's tomorrow
night with Magnolia, right?

28:16.806 --> 28:17.639
That's right.

28:17.639 --> 28:18.472
Sweet!

28:21.243 --> 28:22.400
How you feeling about that?

28:22.400 --> 28:23.983
Yeah.

28:23.983 --> 28:25.962
I'm just a little nervous
because we're supposed

28:25.962 --> 28:26.946
to have sex.

28:26.946 --> 28:29.208
She's just so innocent.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.211
I don't feel like I can be myself.

28:31.211 --> 28:33.788
Hey forget about up
here, come from here.

28:33.788 --> 28:35.084
This is where you connect.

28:35.084 --> 28:37.758
This is where you make love from.

28:37.758 --> 28:39.459
That's where you bang.

28:39.459 --> 28:42.317
Yeah, I'm just tired of
things not working out.

28:42.317 --> 28:46.076
Maybe you're afraid
because she's available.

28:46.076 --> 28:46.954
I don't think so.

28:46.954 --> 28:49.174
Any fear of getting hurt?

28:49.174 --> 28:50.306
I don't know.

28:50.306 --> 28:51.525
Did you confirm with Magnolia?

28:52.392 --> 28:53.250
No?

28:53.250 --> 28:54.468
Why didn't you confirm?

28:54.468 --> 28:55.647
Because I'm not desperate.

28:55.647 --> 28:58.348
Arlo, confirm with the girl.

28:58.348 --> 28:59.596
It'll be fine, man.

28:59.596 --> 29:00.771
Just relax, okay?

29:00.771 --> 29:02.530
I don't want you to have a stroke attack.

29:04.107 --> 29:05.167
There's no such thing as that.

29:05.167 --> 29:09.729
Look hey Arlo, do me a favor,
confirm with the girl, please.

29:09.729 --> 29:10.562
All right?

29:10.562 --> 29:12.449
Look this is probably
the biggest opportunity

29:12.449 --> 29:15.381
of my career honestly, man.

29:15.381 --> 29:18.511
If you love me, you'll confirm.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.613
Scottie, Scottie.

29:29.675 --> 29:30.508
Scott-ie!

29:31.408 --> 29:32.241
Scott-ie!

29:38.424 --> 29:39.757
That was okay.

29:41.534 --> 29:44.648
Hey Ebby, the first time's
always a little weird.

29:44.648 --> 29:47.177
But man, are you beautiful.

29:47.177 --> 29:48.010
Thanks.

29:51.995 --> 29:54.464
My sister's coming to town soon.

29:54.464 --> 29:56.663
Oh yeah, that's right.

29:56.663 --> 29:59.235
She's your twin, right?

29:59.235 --> 30:00.068
Identical?

30:00.068 --> 30:01.102
Yeah.

30:01.102 --> 30:01.952
That's cool.

30:01.952 --> 30:03.119
Is that weird?

30:04.031 --> 30:05.052
No.

30:05.052 --> 30:09.052
It's just I don't know
anything other than that.

30:10.224 --> 30:13.891
You know I think I'm
starting to like you.

30:16.221 --> 30:18.553
Yeah if I'm speaking
from my heart, yeah.

30:18.553 --> 30:20.136
I think I love you.

30:21.793 --> 30:24.793
Well if I'm speaking from my ears,

30:27.499 --> 30:29.838
they're telling me it's time
to go to bed, Cassanova.

30:29.838 --> 30:31.752
Oh that is so mean.

30:31.752 --> 30:34.026
I'm just playing.

30:34.026 --> 30:35.837
I think I love you a little too.

30:39.224 --> 30:40.793
A little more than a little.

30:42.923 --> 30:44.988
But, get your shit together.

30:44.988 --> 30:47.071
Yeah, I will.

30:50.230 --> 30:51.098
Good night.

30:52.963 --> 30:55.083
Scottie, maybe later.

30:55.083 --> 30:58.552
All right, just know I'm prepared.

30:58.552 --> 31:00.299
Hey Moses, hey.

31:00.299 --> 31:01.132
Hey Moses.

31:03.000 --> 31:03.833
Hey Moses.

31:04.839 --> 31:07.525
Shoot, you looking at my ass, Moses.

31:07.525 --> 31:09.608
You're looking at my ass.

31:11.245 --> 31:14.141
Hey Arlo, have you heard from her yet?

31:14.141 --> 31:15.734
Why you talking weird?

31:15.734 --> 31:17.295
Does it sound believable 'cause it's

31:17.295 --> 31:19.061
for a character I'm working on?

31:19.061 --> 31:21.041
It's not super believable.

31:21.041 --> 31:22.843
Maybe it's 'cause I know you.

31:24.369 --> 31:25.492
Canceled.

31:26.366 --> 31:28.764
Nah, she's coming
to my house in an hour.

31:28.764 --> 31:30.071
Why don't you meet me here at three,

31:30.071 --> 31:32.599
bring me some tacos and
sparkling water please.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.349
All right, awesome.

31:37.537 --> 31:38.773
So what you all do?

31:38.773 --> 31:40.458
We gave each other
the best coffee enemas

31:40.458 --> 31:41.291
of our lives.

31:41.291 --> 31:42.227
Really?

31:42.227 --> 31:44.298
Blew it out, yeah.

31:44.298 --> 31:46.811
I'm kidding, man, we had tea.

31:46.811 --> 31:48.645
Did you find anything
else out about the movie?

31:48.645 --> 31:51.165
Not much, but I'm
gonna see her again soon.

31:51.165 --> 31:53.258
And, this is something
I'm kind of considering,

31:53.258 --> 31:55.762
but I told her you're
a big fan of her dad.

31:55.762 --> 31:57.381
They have a big lunch thing next Sunday.

31:57.381 --> 31:59.907
She's gonna try to get us invited.

32:01.390 --> 32:05.814
If we go, I'm serious, like
you've gotta play it cool.

32:05.814 --> 32:06.689
Yeah.

32:06.689 --> 32:08.128
'Cause you've been
really nervous lately.

32:08.128 --> 32:10.128
It's kind of just a lot.

32:10.965 --> 32:11.919
I like this girl, man.

32:11.919 --> 32:13.054
I can't lie.

32:13.054 --> 32:15.394
You know none of those
selfies, autographs,

32:15.394 --> 32:16.573
she'll pick up on that.

32:16.573 --> 32:19.428
She'll smell that like a fearful dog.

32:19.428 --> 32:22.171
You don't want to be
a fearful dog, do you?

32:22.171 --> 32:23.290
Say I'm not a fearful dog.

32:23.290 --> 32:25.923
I am not a fearful dog.

32:25.923 --> 32:27.779
I'm gonna clear the
energy out in the house

32:27.779 --> 32:28.917
if you want to go.

32:28.917 --> 32:30.068
Sure, I was on my way out anyway.

32:30.068 --> 32:31.401
Call me later.

32:32.526 --> 32:34.805
Scottie, my fault on this one.

32:34.805 --> 32:36.135
I was misinformed.

32:36.135 --> 32:38.239
The whole transgendered scenario,

32:38.239 --> 32:40.687
it was going down a wrong
path and I apologize.

32:40.687 --> 32:42.158
I know you put in a lot of work.

32:42.158 --> 32:43.665
Dick, I've been working on that role

32:43.665 --> 32:44.886
for like two fucking weeks.

32:44.886 --> 32:47.364
Look here's the deal, they
only unknowns he's going with

32:47.364 --> 32:50.425
is a real developmentally
disabled guy and a girl.

32:50.425 --> 32:52.525
Those are the only unknowns.

32:52.525 --> 32:54.532
All right, but Dick,
so those two roles--

32:54.532 --> 32:55.365
Stop it!

32:55.365 --> 32:58.028
Those two roles, the
developmentally disabled characters,

32:58.028 --> 33:00.077
maybe he just doesn't want
a name actor in there,

33:00.077 --> 33:01.530
but maybe he wants a no name actor.

33:01.530 --> 33:04.461
It's fucking Moses Duval, Scottie.

33:04.461 --> 33:07.990
The insane thing is because of
who we're working with here,

33:07.990 --> 33:10.482
there are celebrities
coming out of the woodwork

33:10.482 --> 33:12.035
for day player roles on this one.

33:12.035 --> 33:15.142
I hear Tom Cruise is
gonna be a store clerk.

33:15.142 --> 33:17.388
Kevin Bacon is gonna
be some type of baker.

33:17.388 --> 33:19.221
I mean it's insane.

33:19.221 --> 33:22.593
So maybe extra work or something,

33:22.593 --> 33:24.645
something a little smaller, maybe get you

33:24.645 --> 33:26.032
on craft services, do
something to help out

33:26.032 --> 33:27.712
with the crew.

33:27.712 --> 33:29.202
You ever done any grip work?

33:29.202 --> 33:30.081
No.

33:30.081 --> 33:32.582
Now's the time to start.

33:34.101 --> 33:36.177
I wanna nail this mentally
challenged character.

33:36.177 --> 33:37.651
You know just in case I get a chance

33:37.651 --> 33:39.058
to show it to him.

33:39.058 --> 33:40.771
Oh Jesus.

33:40.771 --> 33:42.605
I thought this was just like lunch.

33:42.605 --> 33:44.432
What are you gonna do
drool at the table for him

33:44.432 --> 33:45.322
or something, what?

33:46.305 --> 33:48.026
I just wanna be prepared.

33:48.026 --> 33:51.109
Oh man, okay but look what you said

33:53.052 --> 33:54.276
is politically incorrect.

33:54.276 --> 33:56.874
You have to say developmentally disabled.

33:56.874 --> 33:58.092
Have you done any research?

33:58.092 --> 33:59.137
Yeah, of course.

33:59.137 --> 34:01.782
Watched a ton of movies,
researched a bunch of actors.

34:01.782 --> 34:03.752
A lot of actors got their
start from something like this.

34:03.752 --> 34:06.281
I mean think about Cliff
Robertson, Dustin Hoffman,

34:06.281 --> 34:08.178
Daniel Day Lewis in My
Left Foot, I mean that's...

34:08.178 --> 34:10.647
My left Foot is not
developmentally disabled.

34:10.647 --> 34:12.594
It's physically disabled, nitwit.

34:12.594 --> 34:14.139
There's a difference.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.786
Yeah, but he's disabled.

34:15.786 --> 34:17.659
Actually you're very
close to this character

34:17.659 --> 34:19.826
now that I think about it.

34:23.072 --> 34:24.327
Let's get to work.

34:32.213 --> 34:34.145
Sucked beyond all comprehension.

34:34.145 --> 34:35.694
I swear to God.

34:35.694 --> 34:36.672
I mean it not only sucked.

34:36.672 --> 34:39.812
It was like watching a log
float downstream sucking.

34:39.812 --> 34:40.728
I mean bad.

34:41.695 --> 34:42.592
Let me try it again.

34:42.592 --> 34:43.545
You better.

34:43.545 --> 34:44.795
Okay, go ahead.

34:46.315 --> 34:47.820
Ebby.

34:47.820 --> 34:50.255
Just calling to say hi.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.784
I'd love to see you.

34:51.784 --> 34:53.617
Life is good, call me.

34:58.860 --> 35:01.569
I'm thinking about taking
my girlfriend flowers later.

35:01.569 --> 35:03.144
That's sweet of you.

35:04.023 --> 35:04.902
Yeah.

35:15.422 --> 35:16.255
Good to see you.

35:16.255 --> 35:18.251
Good to see you.

35:18.251 --> 35:23.191
Rock and roll show
tonight, eight pm, free beer.

35:23.191 --> 35:24.834
Just like last time.

35:24.834 --> 35:26.048
You gonna come?

35:26.048 --> 35:27.788
I'm gonna try and make it.

35:27.788 --> 35:29.262
I'm gonna try and make it for sure.

35:29.262 --> 35:30.095
All right.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.836
Well you're my favorite actor in town,

35:31.836 --> 35:33.171
and I would love to have you.

35:33.171 --> 35:34.004
Get outta here.

35:34.004 --> 35:35.507
I would love to have you there, dude.

35:35.507 --> 35:36.340
All right.

35:36.340 --> 35:37.614
I'm gonna get out of
here, love you, buddy.

35:37.614 --> 35:40.724
Good to see you, love you too.

35:40.724 --> 35:42.891
Hey Ebby, your car's here.

35:43.736 --> 35:44.819
Are you home?

35:57.794 --> 35:58.627
Hello?

36:00.714 --> 36:01.714
Anyone home?

36:04.238 --> 36:05.071
Hello?

36:10.075 --> 36:11.579
Ebby?

36:39.005 --> 36:42.329
Oh shit, oh my God, you're not Ebby!

36:42.329 --> 36:43.162
No, I'm not.

36:43.162 --> 36:43.995
I'm just this boyfriend.

36:43.995 --> 36:45.099
This is fucking crazy.

36:45.099 --> 36:45.932
Holy shit.

36:47.207 --> 36:48.349
Get the fuck out.

36:48.349 --> 36:49.182
I'm in the shower.

36:49.182 --> 36:51.789
Right, right, right.

36:51.789 --> 36:52.954
I didn't mean to walk in on you like that.

36:52.954 --> 36:54.248
That's so wrong of me.

36:54.248 --> 36:55.573
I should've knocked on the door first

36:55.573 --> 36:56.500
or something like that.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.378
I'm so sorry.

36:57.378 --> 36:58.430
All right, bye.

36:58.430 --> 36:59.442
Yeah okay.

37:01.063 --> 37:02.015
Hey, what's going on?

37:02.015 --> 37:03.452
Good, how's it going?

37:03.452 --> 37:06.283
No, I just went by to
bring you some flowers,

37:06.283 --> 37:08.585
and I met your sister.

37:08.585 --> 37:10.279
Oh that's sweet.

37:10.279 --> 37:12.663
Yeah I just wanted to bring
you something, you know?

37:12.663 --> 37:14.221
Did you guys hang out?

37:14.221 --> 37:15.626
No, I just said hi.

37:15.626 --> 37:18.928
I didn't want to make
it awkward or anything.

37:18.928 --> 37:21.514
How 'bout dinner,
the three of us tonight?

37:21.514 --> 37:24.005
Yeah you want to do
dinner, the three of us?

37:24.005 --> 37:24.979
All right, yeah.

37:24.979 --> 37:26.562
I'll see you there.

37:29.342 --> 37:32.884
Dude, it's been a crazy fucking day.

37:34.130 --> 37:35.340
It's kind of a long story.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.173
You got any work for me, man?

37:36.173 --> 37:37.813
You got anything coming in?

37:37.813 --> 37:38.693
Any commercials?

37:38.693 --> 37:39.685
I need some fucking money.

37:39.685 --> 37:41.438
Nothing coming in yet, man.

37:41.438 --> 37:46.392
But, I did get my hands on
Moses Duval's new script.

37:47.239 --> 37:48.310
It's fucking incredible.

37:48.310 --> 37:49.447
It's Moses Duval.

37:50.326 --> 37:51.405
No, you can't read it.

37:51.405 --> 37:52.352
You can't even look at it.

37:52.352 --> 37:55.047
You shouldn't even be in
the same room with it.

37:55.047 --> 37:56.889
It's an agent script, okay?

37:56.889 --> 37:58.012
Agent's eyes only.

37:58.012 --> 37:59.291
Sorry, no can do.

37:59.291 --> 38:01.046
Well here's the thing,
I'm going over there

38:01.046 --> 38:02.518
this weekend, so if you
could give me that script,

38:02.518 --> 38:03.351
I could prep it.

38:03.351 --> 38:04.340
I could read it.

38:05.558 --> 38:06.434
Yeah.

38:08.006 --> 38:09.966
I want you to pour over
every inch of this thing.

38:09.966 --> 38:12.031
I want you to know every part, every line

38:12.031 --> 38:12.909
inside, outside.

38:12.909 --> 38:14.952
I want to be able to ask you
how many T's are in the script,

38:14.952 --> 38:16.305
and you'll tell me, 759.

38:16.305 --> 38:17.620
I don't know if that's right.

38:17.620 --> 38:18.501
It might be wrong.

38:18.501 --> 38:19.622
I want you to know everything.

38:19.622 --> 38:21.082
Why do you think people

38:21.082 --> 38:24.832
were just touched by
the Mailman of Wemberly?

38:27.586 --> 38:30.253
You know Tesla, you have light

38:35.520 --> 38:37.399
and static electricity, and then there is

38:37.399 --> 38:41.316
no way of being able to,
I mean I cannot choose

38:42.806 --> 38:45.676
the lightning that strikes me.

38:45.676 --> 38:49.259
I cannot arbitrate
inspiration to that end.

38:51.160 --> 38:51.993
How...

38:55.199 --> 38:56.032
I'm...

39:00.090 --> 39:04.257
The light is being delivered
to the people of Wemberly.

39:07.545 --> 39:10.462
I am not so much a bringer of mail,

39:11.682 --> 39:13.932
I'm a bringer of lightning.

39:20.614 --> 39:22.543
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:22.543 --> 39:23.376
Just wow!

39:26.061 --> 39:29.003
I just finished Duval's script, dude.

39:29.003 --> 39:30.101
It's a masterpiece.

39:30.934 --> 39:31.968
What's it about?

39:31.968 --> 39:34.003
I don't know.

39:34.003 --> 39:36.427
A lot of different things, you know?

39:36.427 --> 39:39.260
But, it's, I mean it's literature.

39:41.324 --> 39:42.574
That's great.

39:46.821 --> 39:48.627
Tonight, I'm gonna see her tonight.

39:49.496 --> 39:51.900
Yeah, we've been texting all day, man.

39:53.140 --> 39:54.346
Yeah man, she's something.

39:54.346 --> 39:55.775
She's really funny.

39:55.775 --> 39:57.322
She's kind of like poetic
with her texts n'stuff.

39:57.322 --> 39:58.239
She's cute.

39:59.194 --> 40:00.360
Wow.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.483
So I hear these noises, right?

40:02.483 --> 40:04.034
It's coming from the shower.

40:04.034 --> 40:05.793
She's masturbating.

40:05.793 --> 40:07.191
I think it's Ebby.

40:07.191 --> 40:09.069
So I take off my clothes, make it all sexy

40:09.069 --> 40:10.559
and hop in there.

40:10.559 --> 40:13.720
It's her twin sister, identical.

40:13.720 --> 40:14.586
Wow.

40:14.586 --> 40:15.834
Yeah, I don't know.

40:15.834 --> 40:16.998
It's kind of weird honestly.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.982
I'm supposed to have dinner
with both of 'em tonight.

40:18.982 --> 40:21.071
Does your
girlfriend know about this?

40:21.071 --> 40:21.949
No.

40:21.949 --> 40:24.281
You know people when they
sleep with their girlfriends

40:24.281 --> 40:25.826
and then their fantasizing
it's somebody else,

40:25.826 --> 40:26.931
you ever try that?

40:26.931 --> 40:27.764
No.

40:27.764 --> 40:28.597
It's pretty great.

40:28.597 --> 40:30.065
I would give it a try,
but anyway think if you're

40:30.065 --> 40:32.281
you know fantasizing
about her sister, thinking

40:32.281 --> 40:34.706
about her sister, but you're
sleeping with your girlfriend

40:34.706 --> 40:37.226
and looking at your
girlfriend but fantasizing

40:37.226 --> 40:38.104
about the sister.

40:38.104 --> 40:39.216
That's so trippy.

40:40.794 --> 40:44.102
One face thinking about this girl.

40:44.102 --> 40:46.765
I mean one day you're into this girl,

40:46.765 --> 40:49.149
one day you're into this girl, why?

40:49.149 --> 40:50.269
It's bizarre.

40:50.269 --> 40:51.519
It's beautiful.

40:53.129 --> 40:54.764
I don't know.

40:54.764 --> 40:56.871
Yeah, I don't know.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.333
I'd be curious to talk to more people

40:58.333 --> 41:00.732
who've had this experience.

41:00.732 --> 41:02.793
So did you talk to
Magnolia about going over

41:02.793 --> 41:04.207
to her dad's place on Sunday?

41:04.207 --> 41:05.623
I'll actually find out tonight.

41:05.623 --> 41:07.174
All right, as soon as
possible if you could, you know?

41:07.174 --> 41:08.381
Yeah, yeah, I know.

41:08.381 --> 41:09.734
Because I know
everything about this guy.

41:09.734 --> 41:10.997
This could be my part,
you know what I mean?

41:10.997 --> 41:12.381
It's really big for me, man.

41:12.381 --> 41:13.429
This could be my Rain Man.

41:13.429 --> 41:14.449
This could put me on the map.

41:14.449 --> 41:15.971
Okay, you're just kind
of making me nervous, man,

41:15.971 --> 41:17.811
because I sure she gets
this stuff all the time.

41:17.811 --> 41:20.207
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna be cool.

41:20.207 --> 41:23.151
Just relax, dude, trust the universe.

41:31.226 --> 41:32.525
This is really good.

41:32.525 --> 41:33.403
Thank you.

41:33.403 --> 41:34.280
You like it?

41:34.280 --> 41:35.428
Yeah, it's great.

41:35.428 --> 41:36.683
You're a really good cook.

41:38.107 --> 41:40.921
Same old, they were happy
I was coming to see you.

41:40.921 --> 41:42.292
So you gonna do Christmas there?

41:42.292 --> 41:43.425
That's the plan.

41:46.632 --> 41:48.374
We haven't talked about it.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.662
So what do you do?

41:52.662 --> 41:54.428
I'm an actor, yeah.

41:54.428 --> 41:55.739
And, I bartend too.

41:57.433 --> 42:00.100
No, I'm an actor who bartends.

42:01.177 --> 42:03.549
What do you like better
Godfather One or Two?

42:03.549 --> 42:04.428
Two.

42:04.428 --> 42:05.964
Thought so.

42:06.842 --> 42:08.175
One of course.

42:11.286 --> 42:14.634
So you been in anything I've seen?

42:14.634 --> 42:15.884
Probably not.

42:20.072 --> 42:21.822
Yeah, a little bit.

42:23.454 --> 42:25.973
What do you think
about the death penalty?

42:26.852 --> 42:27.933
Alex, don't drill the poor boy.

42:27.933 --> 42:29.777
Just trying to see if he has a brain.

42:29.777 --> 42:31.545
You gotta watch those actor guys.

42:31.545 --> 42:34.213
Well, I've never been to Austin.

42:34.213 --> 42:36.046
Let's go see the town.

42:37.320 --> 42:40.111
You know what I gotta read my lines.

42:40.111 --> 42:42.107
Come on, my sister's in town.

42:42.107 --> 42:44.190
Yeah, don't be selfish.

42:47.296 --> 42:48.976
All right.

43:40.288 --> 43:43.202
Yes, oh that's the spot!

43:47.183 --> 43:48.293
Jesus Christ!

43:48.293 --> 43:49.811
Are you not having trouble focusing?

43:49.811 --> 43:50.838
No.

43:51.671 --> 43:52.660
Look in my eyes.

43:52.660 --> 43:53.584
I'm trying.

43:56.766 --> 43:57.784
I can't focus.

43:57.784 --> 43:58.617
I'm sorry.

43:58.617 --> 43:59.654
Come on, I'm close.

44:00.866 --> 44:02.273
Music distracts me.

44:04.349 --> 44:05.433
Here.

44:26.950 --> 44:28.106
These are weird.

44:29.497 --> 44:31.282
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:34.027 --> 44:36.119
I don't know, she's been
going on for two hours.

44:36.119 --> 44:38.395
Wanna go in the closet?

44:38.395 --> 44:39.702
Okay.

44:50.046 --> 44:53.483
Oh, that what amazing.

44:53.483 --> 44:55.983
Good, I'm glad you liked it.

44:56.844 --> 44:58.392
Except I think I got a heel up my ass.

44:59.225 --> 45:00.468
Oh I know you likes that.

45:03.461 --> 45:04.975
I love you, Scottie.

45:04.975 --> 45:07.808
I love you too, sugar.

45:15.508 --> 45:17.176
I didn't catch his name.

45:19.319 --> 45:20.922
He wasn't really my type.

45:20.922 --> 45:24.293
I'm sure it was a
memorable night for him.

45:24.293 --> 45:28.460
There's some extra eggs
in the pan if you want some.

45:39.023 --> 45:41.240
So I have this, like,
photo shoot interview thing.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.356
Do you think you could help me with it?

45:43.356 --> 45:46.059
I actually have a bunch of meetings,

45:46.059 --> 45:47.664
but maybe Scottie can help you?

45:48.513 --> 45:49.415
Oh no, I can't.

45:49.415 --> 45:50.248
I'm sorry.

45:50.248 --> 45:51.634
I gotta memorize my script.

45:53.024 --> 45:53.857
Yeah I do.

45:53.857 --> 45:57.214
Actually a pretty big
one with Moses Duval.

45:57.214 --> 45:59.214
Holy shit, impressive.

46:00.888 --> 46:01.721
Who's that?

46:01.721 --> 46:04.949
Probably the biggest art
house film director there is.

46:04.949 --> 46:06.513
Baby, that's so exciting!

46:06.513 --> 46:07.346
Thanks babe.

46:07.346 --> 46:08.652
I mean I don't have the part yet,

46:08.652 --> 46:10.941
but it's for the lead.

46:11.774 --> 46:13.454
So you wanna go to a funky coffee shop

46:13.454 --> 46:15.301
and work together?

46:15.301 --> 46:16.868
I hate being alone.

46:16.868 --> 46:19.843
You guys can get to know each other.

46:19.843 --> 46:20.843
Yeah okay.

46:28.439 --> 46:29.311
Yeah!

46:29.311 --> 46:30.543
What happened?

46:30.543 --> 46:33.081
Got confirmed for
Sunday at Moses's house.

46:37.219 --> 46:39.253
Oh I just got confirmation
of the photo shoot

46:39.253 --> 46:40.924
interview we have later today.

46:40.924 --> 46:42.570
It's for my magazine.

46:42.570 --> 46:43.549
That's cool.

46:43.549 --> 46:44.382
What's it about?

46:44.382 --> 46:45.799
It's about sex.

46:48.067 --> 46:48.900
Yeah.

46:51.163 --> 46:52.330
200K a year.

46:53.180 --> 46:55.243
You can read it.

46:55.243 --> 46:57.705
Yeah sure, I'll check it out.

47:13.309 --> 47:14.247
It's gorgeous.

47:14.247 --> 47:15.247
Thank you.

47:17.587 --> 47:19.623
Really clean.

47:19.623 --> 47:21.759
We have a lovely housekeeper.

47:25.845 --> 47:28.077
Am I worried that my
husband's gonna leave me?

47:28.077 --> 47:29.222
Of course.

47:29.222 --> 47:31.689
Is there a chance that
I could get pregnant

47:31.689 --> 47:33.045
from a one nighter?

47:33.045 --> 47:33.878
Sure.

47:33.878 --> 47:36.583
But, freedom isn't always
the easiest path to take.

47:36.583 --> 47:41.284
Freedom is facing your
fears and your fantasies.

47:41.284 --> 47:42.667
And, the title Warm Up the Cave is

47:42.667 --> 47:44.889
that a reference to the vagina?

47:46.209 --> 47:47.244
Get that fire going, girl.

47:48.394 --> 47:49.852
No I'm kidding.

47:49.852 --> 47:52.927
What my focus is on obviously is writing

47:52.927 --> 47:56.967
about why humans aren't
really fit to be monogamous.

47:56.967 --> 48:01.003
That particular quote is
really about the importance

48:01.003 --> 48:04.753
of re-questioning our
beliefs and our values.

48:06.024 --> 48:08.702
One of my favorite passages
is from the philosopher

48:08.702 --> 48:10.407
John Locke, and
essentially what he says is

48:10.407 --> 48:15.104
when we don't question our
beliefs, they grow cobwebs,

48:15.104 --> 48:18.508
and they become cold
like and abandoned cave.

48:18.508 --> 48:21.314
So does the simple act
of questioning the things

48:21.314 --> 48:25.429
that we do everyday, it clears the cobwebs

48:25.429 --> 48:27.674
and warms our cave.

48:27.674 --> 48:31.143
That's really gorgeous, very sexy.

48:31.143 --> 48:34.238
You got me turned on
just thinking about it.

48:34.238 --> 48:36.703
You ready to take some photos?

48:36.703 --> 48:37.536
Oh yeah.

48:39.757 --> 48:41.531
Do you mind taking off your dress?

48:41.531 --> 48:42.614
Sure.

48:44.663 --> 48:48.163
Oh my God, you are so flipping gorgeous.

48:50.165 --> 48:51.415
Pout your lips.

48:52.849 --> 48:54.356
I love that.

48:54.356 --> 48:56.563
Now give me some movement,
but like may it natural,

48:56.563 --> 48:57.396
you know?

49:01.829 --> 49:03.162
Let me hear you.

49:04.495 --> 49:05.369
Fuck yeah.

49:08.438 --> 49:09.777
I think we got that.

49:09.777 --> 49:11.600
That was it.

49:11.600 --> 49:15.074
Is there anything else you wanna try?

49:15.074 --> 49:15.907
Yeah.

49:19.290 --> 49:20.526
I love it.

49:20.526 --> 49:24.109
Would you mind taking
a few shots with her?

49:25.095 --> 49:27.429
I mean I'm not really a photographer.

49:32.469 --> 49:35.027
No baby, I mean strip
down to your underwear

49:35.027 --> 49:37.412
and maybe chase her around a bit.

49:37.412 --> 49:38.544
Oh yeah.

49:41.170 --> 49:42.003
No.

49:42.003 --> 49:43.327
Thank you but no.

49:43.327 --> 49:45.763
Come on, we need your help here.

49:45.763 --> 49:47.072
I don't think I should.

49:47.072 --> 49:48.655
Don't be a pussy.

49:53.220 --> 49:55.137
Yeah, this is my art.

49:56.172 --> 49:57.339
It's who I am.

49:59.017 --> 50:00.225
Like you know.

50:00.225 --> 50:01.596
Show me.

50:01.596 --> 50:02.429
Okay.

50:03.942 --> 50:04.942
Up and down.

50:07.810 --> 50:10.560
And, then look at him in the eye.

50:12.635 --> 50:14.968
And, bite his lip like that.

50:21.128 --> 50:22.295
You can do it.

50:29.580 --> 50:30.623
Oh Yeah.

50:30.623 --> 50:31.806
That's it.

50:36.639 --> 50:38.722
Yes, that's it we got it.

50:39.739 --> 50:41.761
Scottie, you look good on camera.

50:41.761 --> 50:43.525
Thank you.

50:44.737 --> 50:47.442
Yeah, let's go swimming.

50:56.581 --> 50:59.025
Nah, I'm just hanging with your sister.

50:59.025 --> 51:00.050
Scottie, get in the pool.

51:00.050 --> 51:01.734
She's just swimming with a friend.

51:01.734 --> 51:04.901
I'm looking forward to dinner tonight.

51:06.551 --> 51:09.468
Really looking forward to it a lot.

51:10.645 --> 51:14.812
All right cool, well I'm
gonna see you for dinner.

51:17.746 --> 51:19.202
I love you too.

51:19.202 --> 51:21.156
I love you too.

51:24.982 --> 51:27.149
Scottie, come on.

51:28.667 --> 51:31.626
Get in the pool, Scottie.

51:31.626 --> 51:32.711
It feels so good.

51:32.711 --> 51:33.554
Yeah, I gotta run.

51:33.554 --> 51:34.387
I gotta run.

51:34.387 --> 51:36.268
Are you sure you don't
wanna stay and eat?

51:36.268 --> 51:38.484
I've gotta get to my acting class.

51:38.484 --> 51:40.341
I have some juice from Barcelona.

51:41.926 --> 51:43.264
Fuck.

51:43.264 --> 51:44.173
It's warm.

51:44.173 --> 51:45.545
You're so boring.

51:45.545 --> 51:46.378
I know.

51:55.487 --> 51:57.070
Gordon?

51:58.695 --> 52:00.296
Welcome.

52:00.296 --> 52:01.719
You're 30 minutes late, man.

52:01.719 --> 52:02.632
I know I'm sorry.

52:02.632 --> 52:04.705
Where were you with that
little girlfriend of yours

52:04.705 --> 52:05.752
or something?

52:06.646 --> 52:07.479
Yeah.

52:07.479 --> 52:08.518
We actually broke up.

52:08.518 --> 52:09.351
What?

52:09.351 --> 52:10.845
I'm seeing somebody new now though.

52:10.845 --> 52:12.413
Oh Lord, I thought she was the reason

52:12.413 --> 52:14.056
you didn't go to New Orleans.

52:14.056 --> 52:15.010
I know, I know.

52:15.010 --> 52:16.903
God man, what are you doing?

52:16.903 --> 52:18.703
You should go to New
Orleans or, shit, Atlanta,

52:18.703 --> 52:20.364
or something, you should give it a shot.

52:20.364 --> 52:22.379
This is gonna be my break.

52:22.379 --> 52:24.463
This is gonna be it, trust me.

52:25.296 --> 52:27.355
What, Moses invited you
to lunch and tells you

52:27.355 --> 52:28.808
to prep the script or what?

52:28.808 --> 52:33.363
Not exactly like that, but
I got invited to lunch, yeah.

52:33.363 --> 52:34.499
I'd be careful if I were you.

52:34.499 --> 52:36.850
I mean I'm not so sure
this is the best idea

52:36.850 --> 52:38.237
you've ever had.

52:38.237 --> 52:39.591
He could be offended.

52:39.591 --> 52:41.741
Yeah, I'm gonna be cool.

52:42.809 --> 52:43.642
Yeah.

52:44.642 --> 52:45.725
Be real cool.

52:47.272 --> 52:48.105
Do it now,

52:48.105 --> 52:49.099
don't ask forgiveness later
forgiveness later.

52:49.932 --> 52:50.765
Do it now.

52:50.765 --> 52:52.015
Your funeral.

52:53.285 --> 52:54.931
I've got this, bro.

52:54.931 --> 52:56.847
Yeah okay, well let's get started.

53:05.987 --> 53:06.820
Oh shit.

53:06.820 --> 53:07.653
Stop Scottie.

53:07.653 --> 53:08.486
I'm sorry, baby.

53:08.486 --> 53:09.944
Just don't touch anything.

53:09.944 --> 53:11.591
Hey.

53:11.591 --> 53:14.369
Alex, I'm gonna give
you a call later, okay?

53:19.002 --> 53:19.835
Oh.

53:26.087 --> 53:27.342
No, she had work.

53:27.342 --> 53:28.175
I thought we were gonna get to listen

53:28.175 --> 53:30.903
to sex noises all night.

53:30.903 --> 53:32.509
Scottie did some modeling.

53:32.509 --> 53:33.676
I'll show you.

53:36.854 --> 53:39.037
You're a real sex stud, Scottie.

53:39.037 --> 53:39.870
Thanks babe.

53:39.870 --> 53:40.703
Oh that reminds me.

53:40.703 --> 53:42.361
There's an amazing band playing tomorrow.

53:42.361 --> 53:43.338
We should all go.

53:43.338 --> 53:44.670
I actually have work tomorrow night,

53:44.670 --> 53:46.146
but Scottie you don't have work.

53:46.146 --> 53:47.097
You can go.

53:47.097 --> 53:49.121
I got that meeting with
the director tomorrow.

53:50.232 --> 53:51.094
Yeah but--

53:51.094 --> 53:52.307
It's not till nine or 10.

53:54.033 --> 53:58.200
I mean I could ask her if
you really don't wanna go.

53:59.348 --> 54:01.313
No, no, I'll go.

54:01.313 --> 54:02.146
Sweet.

54:06.509 --> 54:07.342
No, I do.

54:07.342 --> 54:09.117
Yeah, she's just different.

54:09.117 --> 54:12.063
She means the world
to me, so just try to be

54:12.063 --> 54:13.671
a little more sensitive.

54:13.671 --> 54:15.645
Okay yeah, I will.

54:15.645 --> 54:17.148
I'm sorry I just think I'm nervous.

54:17.148 --> 54:21.086
I got this big movie
director meeting coming up.

54:21.086 --> 54:24.818
Is that new lingerie that you're wearing?

54:24.818 --> 54:26.151
Baby, come here.

54:31.805 --> 54:32.697
I love you.

54:32.697 --> 54:35.313
I'm gonna miss you so much tomorrow.

54:35.313 --> 54:37.126
I'm only gone for one day.

54:37.126 --> 54:38.885
Just be careful.

54:38.885 --> 54:41.306
You're such an actor.

54:41.306 --> 54:43.147
You're gonna do great
in your meeting tomorrow.

54:43.147 --> 54:44.887
The director's gonna love you.

55:06.804 --> 55:08.512
You didn't tell her I
was an actor, did you?

55:08.512 --> 55:09.534
I did what you said.

55:09.534 --> 55:12.031
I just told her you were a friend.

55:12.031 --> 55:14.956
Man, I'm kinda feeling
nervous about meeting her dad.

55:14.956 --> 55:18.622
I looked him up, he's
quite the artist, genius.

55:18.622 --> 55:20.979
Calm down, dude, you're
gonna have a stroke attack.

55:20.979 --> 55:22.636
I'm just saying, man.

55:22.636 --> 55:24.451
Who's all gonna be
there today, do you know?

55:24.451 --> 55:27.675
No, just close friends and
family, not a lot of people.

55:27.675 --> 55:31.437
You should really revel in the
gratitude of just being here.

55:31.437 --> 55:33.451
It's pretty amazing.

55:33.451 --> 55:35.159
All right, you ready to do this?

55:37.616 --> 55:39.994
I'm just gonna call my agent real quick.

55:40.827 --> 55:42.160
Yeah, I just wanna tell him about it.

55:42.160 --> 55:42.993
I'm excited.

55:42.993 --> 55:45.337
I wanna tell him about the
meeting, Moses and everything.

55:45.337 --> 55:46.216
But, you feel okay?

55:46.216 --> 55:47.486
Yeah, I feel good.

55:47.486 --> 55:48.330
I'm excited.

55:49.163 --> 55:51.571
Yeah no, I'm excited.

55:51.571 --> 55:52.841
Okay I'll see you in a second.

55:52.841 --> 55:53.841
All right.

56:05.863 --> 56:10.208
All right, you good
looking son of a bitch.

56:10.208 --> 56:11.782
Let's do this.

56:20.928 --> 56:23.006
Can I have a sip of that?

56:23.006 --> 56:25.423
No I better hold onto this.

56:28.201 --> 56:29.364
I'm from everywhere.

56:32.587 --> 56:34.603
Here have some of my orange juice.

56:46.101 --> 56:48.697
Yeah it's super good?

56:48.697 --> 56:51.544
It's a special family recipe.

56:51.544 --> 56:53.127
Yeah, super good.

56:55.986 --> 56:57.903
You're amazing to me.

56:58.800 --> 57:00.383
Look at you sitting up.

57:00.383 --> 57:02.003
Do you know what that chair is called?

57:02.003 --> 57:02.836
Yeah.

57:02.836 --> 57:04.180
That's a papasan.

57:04.180 --> 57:06.134
Can you say papasan chair?

57:07.050 --> 57:08.109
Yeah papasan.

57:08.109 --> 57:10.776
There you said it right there.

57:15.799 --> 57:18.176
Let's go in the Airstream and fuck.

57:18.176 --> 57:20.866
There's nobody in there.

57:20.866 --> 57:22.279
You want to?

57:22.279 --> 57:23.443
Of course.

57:23.443 --> 57:25.071
But, I was thinking we could wait because

57:25.071 --> 57:26.547
I really respect you.

57:26.547 --> 57:29.353
I wanna give you your respect.

57:36.165 --> 57:38.132
But, thank you for the offer.

57:38.132 --> 57:39.872
It means a lot.

57:39.872 --> 57:41.374
I'm very flattered.

57:41.374 --> 57:42.207
I want to.

57:46.792 --> 57:48.209
You're welcome.

57:49.638 --> 57:51.193
That's how we do it out here.

57:51.193 --> 57:52.237
Yeah.

57:52.237 --> 57:56.084
We like it super good all the time.

57:56.084 --> 57:57.821
I got a question for you, Scottie.

57:57.821 --> 57:59.453
Would you like to be in a movie?

57:59.453 --> 58:00.804
I'd be in the movie, yeah.

58:01.637 --> 58:03.810
You wanna act in a movie, Scottie?

58:03.810 --> 58:05.717
Yeah, well yeah.

58:05.717 --> 58:08.305
We'll see about that.

58:08.305 --> 58:09.138
Hey sis.

58:10.349 --> 58:11.430
Hey man.

58:11.430 --> 58:13.072
This is my little brother Dice.

58:13.072 --> 58:14.060
Hey Dice, how's it going buddy.

58:14.060 --> 58:14.893
Nice to meet you.

58:14.893 --> 58:15.726
I met your friend.

58:15.726 --> 58:17.642
He's pretty cool.

58:17.642 --> 58:18.645
Oh good, yeah.

58:18.645 --> 58:19.615
He's a nice guy.

58:19.615 --> 58:21.695
It's pretty cool y'all are friends.

58:21.695 --> 58:22.528
Yeah.

58:22.528 --> 58:23.649
I've known him a long time.

58:23.649 --> 58:25.190
He seems pretty capable.

58:26.756 --> 58:28.557
I mean he seems pretty independent

58:28.557 --> 58:30.125
for a developmentally disabled person.

58:30.125 --> 58:31.458
Hey guys.

58:31.458 --> 58:32.291
Arlo.

58:33.669 --> 58:35.077
Hi.

58:35.077 --> 58:35.910
Hi.

58:37.189 --> 58:38.205
Are you having fun?

58:38.205 --> 58:39.174
Yeah.

58:39.174 --> 58:41.395
I just talked to you
mom like a minute ago,

58:41.395 --> 58:43.634
and she's pretty worried.

58:43.634 --> 58:45.221
I told her we'd be leaving here

58:45.221 --> 58:46.057
something came up.

58:46.057 --> 58:48.837
I just talked to her,
and she said I can stay.

58:48.837 --> 58:49.918
Scottie, I just talked to her.

58:49.918 --> 58:51.368
Let's get outta here, come on.

58:51.368 --> 58:52.750
No, you didn't.

58:52.750 --> 58:53.588
Yes, I did, Scottie.

58:53.588 --> 58:55.624
Hey Arlo, I've been
standing here the whole time.

58:55.624 --> 58:57.374
She hasn't just let him stay.

58:57.374 --> 59:00.156
She texted him, Magnolia.

59:00.156 --> 59:01.573
Scottie, come on.

59:03.807 --> 59:05.008
I want you to meet someone.

59:05.008 --> 59:07.660
This is Rachel my producer.

59:07.660 --> 59:09.367
Rachel, this is Scottie.

59:09.367 --> 59:10.608
Hi Rachel.

59:10.608 --> 59:11.962
Hi Scottie.

59:11.962 --> 59:15.122
Scottie, we're, I know this is hard

59:15.122 --> 59:18.112
for you to fathom because
of your challenges,

59:18.112 --> 59:19.886
but we're making a movie.

59:19.886 --> 59:21.256
I'd love to have you involved.

59:21.256 --> 59:22.635
I think you'd be,

59:22.635 --> 59:23.513
The lead.

59:23.513 --> 59:26.237
We've had so many
problems finding our lead.

59:26.237 --> 59:27.070
We gotta go.

59:27.070 --> 59:27.972
His mom want him back home.

59:27.972 --> 59:30.322
But, he's so cute, and I love him.

59:30.322 --> 59:32.099
I could stay.

59:32.099 --> 59:32.932
He can stay.

59:32.932 --> 59:34.709
Listen how 'bout just long enough for him

59:34.709 --> 59:36.209
to hear a little bit about the story.

59:39.142 --> 59:40.053
Oh really?

59:40.053 --> 59:41.511
Back off!

59:41.511 --> 59:43.108
Hey Dice.

59:43.108 --> 59:44.550
Back off, bitch.

59:49.944 --> 59:51.923
Hey come on, he needs sternness.

59:51.923 --> 59:54.498
Here, take my card.

59:54.498 --> 59:56.210
But, I wanted to keep him.

59:56.210 --> 59:58.345
That's a lot of sternness, young man.

59:58.345 --> 59:59.257
It's a little too much.

59:59.257 --> 01:00:01.756
I don't think anyone
needs that much stern-itude.

01:00:01.756 --> 01:00:02.946
You can be stern with me.

01:00:02.946 --> 01:00:03.920
Yes, later on.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.253
I haven't eaten.

01:00:07.592 --> 01:00:08.651
I hope he comes back.

01:00:08.651 --> 01:00:09.484
No, he probably won't.

01:00:09.484 --> 01:00:10.620
Not without his caretaker.

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.913
What's up with that swarthy guy?

01:00:12.913 --> 01:00:13.934
He creeps me out.

01:00:13.934 --> 01:00:16.148
Yeah totally, it's a gift.

01:00:16.148 --> 01:00:18.315
Let's go get some quiche.

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:19.148
Arlo.

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:20.027
I can't believe you lied to me!

01:00:20.027 --> 01:00:21.486
How am I ever gonna talk to her again?

01:00:21.486 --> 01:00:22.545
Do me a favor, lose my number.

01:00:22.545 --> 01:00:23.405
We're done!

01:00:23.405 --> 01:00:24.238
Dude.

01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:34.961
You're a fucking asshole, okay!

01:00:34.961 --> 01:00:36.265
I'm serious, don't ever talk to again.

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.098
We're done.

01:00:37.098 --> 01:00:37.931
I'm serious.

01:00:37.931 --> 01:00:39.598
You're a mess, dude.

01:01:05.726 --> 01:01:06.559
Nothing.

01:01:07.949 --> 01:01:09.829
You're not even dressed for the show.

01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:10.915
Oh shit.

01:01:10.915 --> 01:01:12.813
Oh yeah, the show.

01:01:12.813 --> 01:01:14.063
I'll be back.

01:01:15.523 --> 01:01:16.541
Here.

01:01:17.415 --> 01:01:21.582
This is not the
company I want to be seen with.

01:01:23.904 --> 01:01:24.917
Now get up.

01:01:24.917 --> 01:01:26.151
I want to see your dance moves.

01:01:26.151 --> 01:01:28.449
I feel so much better.

01:01:28.449 --> 01:01:32.616
I don't want to be seen
with a flacid penis tonight.

01:01:35.531 --> 01:01:37.031
Is this real life?

01:01:38.735 --> 01:01:39.753
Okay just stay still.

01:01:39.753 --> 01:01:40.753
All right.

01:01:41.762 --> 01:01:44.262
Just barely, feel the music.

01:01:45.523 --> 01:01:46.773
Feel the music.

01:01:48.915 --> 01:01:49.748
All right?

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:52.391
I fucking went for it,
you know what I'm saying?

01:01:52.391 --> 01:01:54.345
And, if Arlo doesn't
understand that, then fuck him.

01:01:54.345 --> 01:01:55.232
Yeah, fuck him.

01:01:55.232 --> 01:01:56.799
That took balls, baby.

01:01:56.799 --> 01:02:00.413
I didn't think you had
something like that in you.

01:02:00.413 --> 01:02:01.564
Go get dressed.

01:02:01.564 --> 01:02:03.916
It's time for the show.

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:41.483
No, it's not.

01:02:41.483 --> 01:02:43.725
It's my girlfriend's twin sister.

01:02:44.785 --> 01:02:45.618
Identical.

01:02:45.618 --> 01:02:47.201
Okay, I could not do that.

01:02:47.201 --> 01:02:48.662
I could not date a twin.

01:02:48.662 --> 01:02:50.711
Once I dated a dude who just had a brother

01:02:50.711 --> 01:02:53.975
hotter than him, and I
fucked my whole life up,

01:02:53.975 --> 01:02:57.542
and it was so awesome, great sex.

01:02:58.375 --> 01:02:59.502
That's all I will say.

01:02:59.502 --> 01:03:00.960
Worth it.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.793
Fucked my whole life up, worth it.

01:03:05.277 --> 01:03:07.987
And, you like her a little, don't you?

01:03:07.987 --> 01:03:11.370
No, I mean definitely she's sexy.

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:12.537
But, like nah.

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.806
Okay.

01:03:16.806 --> 01:03:18.350
Well where's her sister then?

01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:19.531
She's out of town.

01:03:19.531 --> 01:03:20.602
She's out of town.

01:03:20.602 --> 01:03:23.369
It's just you two in
the club, getting drunk.

01:03:23.369 --> 01:03:26.959
You're gonna try to bang her, aren't you?

01:03:26.959 --> 01:03:29.358
♫ I don't think you like
your girlfriend at all

01:03:29.358 --> 01:03:32.413
♫ And I think you should
bang that bad bitch

01:03:32.413 --> 01:03:34.044
♫ Oh my God, she's so hot

01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:35.973
♫ Oh my God

01:03:35.973 --> 01:03:37.556
Bang her, bang her.

01:03:38.854 --> 01:03:40.937
Yeah I should bang her.

01:03:42.904 --> 01:03:45.250
You should bang that.

01:03:52.783 --> 01:03:56.033
I'm really sorry about what happened.

01:03:57.955 --> 01:03:59.546
Let's do some meditating.

01:03:59.546 --> 01:04:00.379
Okay.

01:04:04.909 --> 01:04:07.363
Why do you think all
this is happening to me?

01:04:07.363 --> 01:04:10.196
Let's do some meditating.

01:04:17.338 --> 01:04:18.838
I've done all this work to get you

01:04:18.838 --> 01:04:20.795
where you need to be spiritually,

01:04:20.795 --> 01:04:23.208
but you're building weak foundations.

01:04:24.249 --> 01:04:26.216
I can't tell you.

01:04:28.906 --> 01:04:30.946
You have to figure this out.

01:04:30.946 --> 01:04:32.042
Okay, thank you, Arlo.

01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:33.660
Thank you.

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.966
That's great.

01:04:34.966 --> 01:04:37.133
I have to teach a class.

01:05:12.027 --> 01:05:15.030
She left early for
California this morning.

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:17.879
She said you left her last
night and didn't say goodbye.

01:05:17.879 --> 01:05:20.162
Were you drunk or something?

01:05:20.162 --> 01:05:22.326
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

01:05:22.326 --> 01:05:23.721
This isn't fucking right.

01:05:23.721 --> 01:05:24.989
I don't think I'm in any state to be

01:05:24.989 --> 01:05:26.529
in a relationship, Ebby.

01:05:26.529 --> 01:05:28.890
And, here's the thing,
all right, if your sister

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:30.209
would've wanted to hook
up with me last night,

01:05:30.209 --> 01:05:31.042
I think I'd have done it.

01:05:31.042 --> 01:05:31.875
I think I'd have done it.

01:05:31.875 --> 01:05:33.495
I'm sorry, that's fucking wrong.

01:05:35.623 --> 01:05:36.580
Yeah.

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:37.844
Well obviously you didn't do anything.

01:05:37.844 --> 01:05:40.034
So why are you even telling me this.

01:05:40.034 --> 01:05:41.512
Cause I don't wanna
waste your time anymore.

01:05:41.512 --> 01:05:44.516
It's unlikely I'm every
gonna hit this year deadline.

01:05:44.516 --> 01:05:48.622
It's honestly unlikely I'm ever
gonna get my shit together.

01:05:48.622 --> 01:05:51.455
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.

01:05:52.455 --> 01:05:56.046
Oh my God, are you breaking up with me?

01:05:56.046 --> 01:05:56.879
Really?

01:06:19.305 --> 01:06:21.222
Scottie, hey Scottie.

01:06:25.531 --> 01:06:27.893
You can't take it so hard, man.

01:06:27.893 --> 01:06:29.342
It's not just Moses, man.

01:06:29.342 --> 01:06:32.250
It's everything, you know what I mean?

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:34.417
I'm a fucking loser, Dick.

01:06:37.263 --> 01:06:38.680
Dick, I'm lost.

01:06:40.516 --> 01:06:43.658
Scottie, I ever tell you
what Brando said to me

01:06:43.658 --> 01:06:45.195
on that flight to Paris?

01:06:45.195 --> 01:06:47.062
Yeah, he said close the window.

01:06:47.062 --> 01:06:49.039
No, not that.

01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:50.780
I mean he said that, yeah.

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:53.383
But, he told me something else too.

01:06:53.383 --> 01:06:56.883
I was just a young kid, man, just like you

01:06:57.842 --> 01:07:01.248
searching for something,
lost in the world.

01:07:01.248 --> 01:07:02.896
He looked me in the eyes, and do you know

01:07:02.896 --> 01:07:03.942
what he said?

01:07:03.942 --> 01:07:07.101
He said, "If you want to
make it in this business,

01:07:07.101 --> 01:07:10.939
"you gotta believe in
yourself first, Dick."

01:07:12.551 --> 01:07:16.605
You need to go to New Orleans, Scottie.

01:07:16.605 --> 01:07:18.203
Man, New Orleans, I don't know.

01:07:18.203 --> 01:07:20.198
I'm just gonna be fucking
lost in New Orleans, Dick.

01:07:20.198 --> 01:07:24.037
Everybody's lost in this
crazy, brutal world, man.

01:07:24.037 --> 01:07:28.204
But, it's being lost with
hope that gives you a chance.

01:07:30.316 --> 01:07:32.816
Lost with hope, I like that.

01:07:33.805 --> 01:07:35.004
Get your fucking foot off my lap.

01:07:35.004 --> 01:07:37.155
I think you know what to do.

01:07:37.155 --> 01:07:38.187
You believe in yourself, Scottie?

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:39.020
I do.

01:07:39.932 --> 01:07:41.265
Thank you, Dick.

01:07:43.083 --> 01:07:44.088
I love you, man.

01:07:44.088 --> 01:07:45.205
I love you, Dick.

01:07:45.205 --> 01:07:46.600
You're a prince.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.515
Give me a kiss.

01:07:47.515 --> 01:07:49.098
Thank you.

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:49.931
I love you too.

01:07:49.931 --> 01:07:51.101
I love you.

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:52.265
What are you doing?

01:07:52.265 --> 01:07:53.098
I'm gonna kiss you one time.

01:07:55.184 --> 01:07:56.024
What are you doing, Dick?

01:07:56.024 --> 01:07:57.168
Are you trying to kiss me?

01:07:58.001 --> 01:08:00.207
Get the fuck outta here.

01:08:00.207 --> 01:08:04.374
Okay, just looking
at your eyes for awhile.

01:08:05.278 --> 01:08:06.450
Love you, Scottie.

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:07.700
Love you too.

01:08:25.117 --> 01:08:25.950
I'm Scottie.

01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:26.970
You were gonna cast me in your film.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:29.734
I came by the other day.

01:08:29.734 --> 01:08:30.568
Yeah.

01:08:32.068 --> 01:08:33.620
It's nice.

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:35.140
Have you met Bungie.

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.307
She's a clown.

01:08:37.276 --> 01:08:38.795
Blue.

01:08:42.877 --> 01:08:43.877
That's nice.

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:46.246
That's real nice.

01:08:47.385 --> 01:08:49.997
So mister actor, what can I do for you?

01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:54.444
I'm really sorry about that,
but I want this role, Moses.

01:08:54.444 --> 01:08:55.777
I mean this is a great role.

01:08:55.777 --> 01:08:57.813
I mean this is gonna be obviously because

01:08:57.813 --> 01:08:59.524
it's Moses Duval.

01:08:59.524 --> 01:09:02.513
It's gonna be Oscar nominated, the movie,

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:05.452
the role, I mean it's a career maker,

01:09:05.452 --> 01:09:06.678
and wouldn't that be just like me

01:09:06.678 --> 01:09:09.434
to take an absolute no name
from fucking Austin, Texas,

01:09:09.434 --> 01:09:11.571
put him in the role of his career?

01:09:11.571 --> 01:09:12.760
Yeah.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.117
I've got a compass inside me.

01:09:14.117 --> 01:09:16.363
It's like a little
inner ticker, all right?

01:09:16.363 --> 01:09:19.723
I gotta go, like gravity's
pull, wherever attracts me.

01:09:19.723 --> 01:09:21.036
Do you understand?

01:09:21.036 --> 01:09:23.122
It's gotta come from a
place of authenticity.

01:09:23.122 --> 01:09:24.953
I need to actually have somebody
that's actually phisically

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:27.078
or intellectually challenged.

01:09:27.078 --> 01:09:28.265
I can do this role.

01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:31.376
I've been studying acting my whole life.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:33.153
This is my passion Moses.

01:09:33.153 --> 01:09:35.161
This is what makes me want to live.

01:09:35.161 --> 01:09:37.770
This is what gives me my breath, Moses.

01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:39.180
Please if you just give me a chance,

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.595
and you just give me
this role, I promise you,

01:09:41.595 --> 01:09:44.929
I promise you, I will do an amazing job.

01:09:48.966 --> 01:09:50.236
You got it.

01:09:51.738 --> 01:09:53.368
No, you don't have the role,

01:09:53.368 --> 01:09:55.308
but you do have an energy I like.

01:09:55.308 --> 01:09:58.310
You know you're a chronic bullshitter,

01:09:58.310 --> 01:10:01.259
and that's what this
business is all about.

01:10:01.259 --> 01:10:03.857
I'm sure somewhere down the line I'll have

01:10:03.857 --> 01:10:06.104
a position for you.

01:10:06.104 --> 01:10:09.104
You have a lot of genuine potential.

01:10:10.302 --> 01:10:12.525
You wouldn't be here right
now if I didn't think

01:10:12.525 --> 01:10:13.726
that was the case.

01:10:13.726 --> 01:10:14.756
Do you understand?

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:16.324
Yeah.

01:10:17.915 --> 01:10:18.748
Yeah.

01:10:20.703 --> 01:10:22.383
Put it over there.

01:10:22.383 --> 01:10:23.216
The towel?

01:10:23.216 --> 01:10:24.674
Yeah.

01:10:24.674 --> 01:10:27.007
Blue usually runs my towels.

01:10:28.831 --> 01:10:29.720
She's wonderful.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.497
She makes a great Mai
Thai, and she's not a bad

01:10:32.497 --> 01:10:34.179
little mime.

01:10:34.179 --> 01:10:37.193
Just get her to shut her fucking mouth.

01:10:37.193 --> 01:10:38.225
Wanna do me another favor?

01:10:38.225 --> 01:10:39.058
Sure, anything yeah.

01:10:39.058 --> 01:10:40.811
You need to get the
fuck off my property.

01:10:40.811 --> 01:10:42.281
All right, yeah.

01:10:42.281 --> 01:10:44.433
Do you understand about
all the things I've said?

01:10:44.433 --> 01:10:46.394
Could you just tell Magnolia that Arlo

01:10:46.394 --> 01:10:48.229
didn't know anything
about me coming over here

01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:49.479
and doing that?

01:10:50.964 --> 01:10:52.830
I'll make that a priority.

01:10:57.647 --> 01:10:58.483
So what'd he say?

01:10:58.483 --> 01:11:01.236
He say anything else about
your whole character thing?

01:11:01.236 --> 01:11:03.377
Actually he said I was a good actor,

01:11:03.377 --> 01:11:05.850
and that he wants to work with me one day.

01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:07.717
Whoa, that's amazing.

01:11:07.717 --> 01:11:08.550
I know.

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:09.581
I've been tell you you're a good actor.

01:11:09.581 --> 01:11:11.277
You just gotta believe in yourself.

01:11:11.277 --> 01:11:12.360
Faith, faith.

01:11:13.576 --> 01:11:15.640
That's your issue, bro.

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.679
But, that's amazing.

01:11:17.679 --> 01:11:19.012
What about Ebby?

01:11:20.367 --> 01:11:23.284
You know I broke it off with her.

01:11:25.839 --> 01:11:28.470
Cause I'm just in no state to be

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:30.109
in a relationship right now.

01:11:31.165 --> 01:11:32.481
Says my bank account.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:35.873
What am I gonna say?

01:11:35.873 --> 01:11:38.423
Hey, I don't know what
I'm doing with my career

01:11:38.423 --> 01:11:40.734
or my life, and I know
you want to have kids

01:11:40.734 --> 01:11:42.271
and a family one day, but
if you could just wait

01:11:42.271 --> 01:11:43.632
for me to get my shit together.

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:45.292
It might be a year.

01:11:45.292 --> 01:11:46.466
It might be 20 years.

01:11:46.466 --> 01:11:47.403
It might never happen.

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:48.733
I mean, dude, come on.

01:11:48.733 --> 01:11:51.096
No, I don't think you should say that.

01:11:51.096 --> 01:11:54.646
I think you should say,
listen from my heart

01:11:54.646 --> 01:11:56.954
what I want to tell you is I got something

01:11:56.954 --> 01:11:58.655
I'm really passionate about,
and it's something I love.

01:11:58.655 --> 01:12:00.062
And, it's who I am.

01:12:00.062 --> 01:12:00.895
It's what I do.

01:12:00.895 --> 01:12:02.194
I don't want to live life with regrets.

01:12:02.194 --> 01:12:05.131
I doubt she wants you to
life life with regrets.

01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:06.668
You say listen even if
I do this my whole life,

01:12:06.668 --> 01:12:08.725
and I never make it, I'll still find a way

01:12:08.725 --> 01:12:11.035
to hold up my end of the
bargain whatever bargain

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:12.165
we make.

01:12:12.165 --> 01:12:15.158
And, I'll you know, I'll
find a way to carry my load.

01:12:15.158 --> 01:12:16.569
You tell her you love her.

01:12:16.569 --> 01:12:17.902
Do you love her?

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:20.994
Yeah.

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:24.906
Kind of.

01:12:27.975 --> 01:12:31.308
Maybe think about tell her how you feel.

01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:33.523
Yeah.

01:12:33.523 --> 01:12:35.940
Well get on the road, why
don't you give me a hug?

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:37.330
Come on in, buddy.

01:12:37.330 --> 01:12:39.158
I know you don't like these hugs.

01:12:39.158 --> 01:12:40.594
I'm sorry, man.

01:12:40.594 --> 01:12:41.730
It's all right, don't sweat it, man.

01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:43.124
It was entertaining.

01:12:43.124 --> 01:12:44.209
I'm proud of you.

01:12:44.209 --> 01:12:45.042
Good.

01:12:45.042 --> 01:12:45.875
You're giving off good energy.

01:12:45.875 --> 01:12:47.463
I'm actually gonna bask in this energy,

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:48.307
what you're leaving behind.

01:12:48.307 --> 01:12:50.277
It's pretty nice.

01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:31.640
Just let me talk to
you for a minute, okay?

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.214
Can you come outside?

01:13:34.214 --> 01:13:36.062
I want to show you something.

01:13:41.295 --> 01:13:42.902
Come on.

01:13:42.902 --> 01:13:44.548
Isn't that you car.

01:13:44.548 --> 01:13:45.965
Yeah.

01:13:50.224 --> 01:13:52.819
Look I'm gonna do
this acting thing, okay?

01:13:52.819 --> 01:13:53.682
'Cause it's who I am.

01:13:53.682 --> 01:13:54.922
It's what I love.

01:13:54.922 --> 01:13:57.727
But, I promise you that I will hold up

01:13:57.727 --> 01:14:00.849
whatever end of my bargain that we make

01:14:00.849 --> 01:14:04.375
you know if you want to
make a bargain with me.

01:14:04.375 --> 01:14:07.047
But, I'm going to New Orleans.

01:14:07.047 --> 01:14:09.879
I want you to come with me.

01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:12.123
Now.

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:15.234
You think I can just
hop in your car and drive

01:14:15.234 --> 01:14:16.484
to New Orleans.

01:14:18.779 --> 01:14:22.176
I mean yeah I guess I
didn't think about it.

01:14:22.176 --> 01:14:23.389
I mean yeah.

01:14:23.389 --> 01:14:25.427
No, I have a life and responsibilities

01:14:25.427 --> 01:14:27.333
I have to tend to.

01:14:31.703 --> 01:14:33.953
No, I can come visit you.

01:14:35.644 --> 01:14:38.811
Hopefully even in the next few months.

01:14:40.174 --> 01:14:41.362
Okay, I'm gonna go then.

01:14:41.362 --> 01:14:43.402
I'm gonna go to New Orleans.

01:14:53.148 --> 01:14:54.116
I'm gonna go.

01:14:54.116 --> 01:14:57.026
So you wanna come in and
do a little love making

01:14:57.026 --> 01:14:58.266
before you go?

01:14:58.266 --> 01:15:01.374
Yeah I do, I really do,
but I'm not gonna do that

01:15:01.374 --> 01:15:05.541
because I want to show you that
I'm not sexually motivated.

01:15:07.376 --> 01:15:08.630
Okay.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:12.166
Okay, so I'm gonna go to New Orleans.

01:15:18.805 --> 01:15:20.638
I mean what's an hour?

01:15:21.666 --> 01:15:22.499
It's nothing.

01:15:22.499 --> 01:15:24.479
Right, I'm not perfect.

01:15:24.479 --> 01:15:26.660
No, you're not.

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.199
A little love making will be good for you.

01:15:28.199 --> 01:15:29.041
It will.

01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:31.169
Or, it'll be
better with my sister.

01:15:31.169 --> 01:15:32.765
That is so wrong.

01:15:32.765 --> 01:15:33.924
Is it?

01:15:33.924 --> 01:15:35.048
I guess I deserve it.

01:15:35.048 --> 01:15:36.325
You know your life
would be so much better

01:15:36.325 --> 01:15:38.306
if you just kept your life shut.

01:15:38.306 --> 01:15:39.694
I know.

01:15:39.694 --> 01:15:43.861
♫ Yeah, honey you're my best friend

Are you sure you don't
wanna stay and eat?

01:16:23.734 --> 01:16:25.112
This little piggy stayed home.

01:16:25.112 --> 01:16:26.914
You like this don't you?

01:16:26.914 --> 01:16:29.570
Mark.

01:16:32.951 --> 01:16:35.016

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.168
Vagina.

01:16:51.168 --> 01:16:52.892
There are celebrities
coming out of the woodwork

01:16:52.892 --> 01:16:55.082
just for little day
player roles on this one.

01:16:55.082 --> 01:16:57.210
I heard Tom Cruise is
gonna be a store clerk.

01:16:57.210 --> 01:16:59.129
Kevin Bacon's gonna be some type of priest

01:16:59.129 --> 01:17:00.041
with a bum leg.

01:17:00.041 --> 01:17:02.106
Michael Cera is gonna play a tiny baby.

01:17:02.106 --> 01:17:05.576
Jimmy Super Fly Snuka
is gonna be in this one.

01:17:05.576 --> 01:17:06.409
I want Scottie.

01:17:06.409 --> 01:17:07.985
I sorry he needs some sternness.

01:17:07.985 --> 01:17:09.581
Hey well take me card.

01:17:09.581 --> 01:17:10.897
But, I love him.

01:17:10.897 --> 01:17:12.536
I know I like him too.

01:17:12.536 --> 01:17:13.369
He's perfect.

01:17:13.369 --> 01:17:14.202
He's ideal.

01:17:14.202 --> 01:17:15.551
But, that other guy is hostile.

01:17:15.551 --> 01:17:19.104
It's Moses fucking Duval
that we're talking about here.

01:17:19.104 --> 01:17:20.970
When he gets a vision, he sticks to it.

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:22.946
I bet he's not SAG.

01:17:22.946 --> 01:17:24.322
I bet he's not SAG.

01:17:24.322 --> 01:17:25.465
Man, he can't fold paper.

01:17:26.577 --> 01:17:28.764
The guy was a professional
magician at the age of 10.

01:17:28.764 --> 01:17:29.696
Bring him back.

01:17:29.696 --> 01:17:31.124
I want to tell him a little
more about the story.

01:17:31.124 --> 01:17:32.561
It's a line I just dropped,
and I'd like to bring

01:17:32.561 --> 01:17:33.763
it back in there.

01:17:33.763 --> 01:17:34.825
He broke my nail.

01:17:34.825 --> 01:17:36.130
Then the storyline.

01:17:36.130 --> 01:17:39.130
This little piggy had a rough day.

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:43.828
And, this little piggy had none.

01:17:43.828 --> 01:17:45.388
And, this little piggy
got in the car and went

01:17:45.388 --> 01:17:46.638
to New Orleans.

01:17:51.671 --> 01:17:54.849

this is a controversial one.

01:19:43.472 --> 01:19:47.555
Why the decision to have
a blind cinematographer.

01:19:53.515 --> 01:19:54.765
Like a chive.

01:19:56.388 --> 01:19:57.428
