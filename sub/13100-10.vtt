WEBVTT

00:07.125 --> 00:08.917
(Londo)
'This is absurd.'

00:09.000 --> 00:11.542
'Two hours I have
been standing in line.'

00:11.625 --> 00:14.083
'"Our staff are overwhelmed",
they tell me.'

00:14.167 --> 00:17.458
"Too many people trying to
get home or escape here."

00:17.542 --> 00:18.583
Ah!

00:18.667 --> 00:21.042
Rumors of rebellion and war.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.708
Even the diplomatic
lanes are clogged.

00:23.792 --> 00:24.833
Fah!

00:26.208 --> 00:29.208
If you ask me,
I know the real problem.

00:29.292 --> 00:32.750
Ever since the Earthers put
Narns on their security force

00:32.833 --> 00:34.708
Everything here has
gone to hell.

00:34.792 --> 00:36.500
They're not very efficient,
you know.

00:36.583 --> 00:39.542
You have to keep an eye
on them at all times.

00:39.625 --> 00:41.167
Next.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.917
Identicard, please.

00:46.708 --> 00:48.500
How strange.

00:48.583 --> 00:51.417
I'm not getting a confirmation
on your identicard.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.292
Oh, please!
You know who I am.

00:54.375 --> 00:56.625
Oh, yes, I know who you are,
ambassador.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.542
But the computer,
you see, does not.

00:58.625 --> 01:02.167
And verification is required
prior to entry.

01:02.250 --> 01:05.083
Perhaps I have entered
the data incorrectly.

01:05.167 --> 01:07.375
We are, after all,
very inefficient.

01:07.458 --> 01:10.042
Yes, one must keep an
eye on us at all times.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.292
Alright, now,
you listen to me--

01:12.375 --> 01:13.542
In a moment.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.125
Meanwhile, we have many
others coming through.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.083
Please step aside, ambassador.

01:17.167 --> 01:21.042
This shouldn't take more than,
oh, two or three standard hours.

01:22.667 --> 01:26.042
Madness.
Total and complete madness.

01:26.125 --> 01:27.625
This never would have happened

01:27.708 --> 01:30.083
if the humans hadn't started
fighting with one another.

01:32.417 --> 01:34.833
[gunfire]

01:36.417 --> 01:38.292
[whirring]

01:43.417 --> 01:45.250
[explosion]

01:45.333 --> 01:46.917
Thirty percent hit
to rear decks.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.542
One more of those, and we're
going to lose rotation

01:48.625 --> 01:49.792
and go z-gravity.

01:49.875 --> 01:51.417
We can't outrun them
in normal space.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.000
Major, we have to jump.

01:53.083 --> 01:54.542
And leave our fighters
stranded out there?

01:54.625 --> 01:55.958
No, we can't jump without them.

01:56.042 --> 01:57.750
If we reel them in,
we're gonna lose our screen.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.708
Clarkstown will burn us
from stem to stern!

01:59.792 --> 02:01.167
Damn it!
Haven't we lost enough..

02:01.250 --> 02:02.458
[rumbling]

02:02.542 --> 02:03.958
If you won't jump,
then you've got to let me

02:04.042 --> 02:05.292
open fire with
the aft batteries.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.333
I don't wanna kill any
more of our own ships!

02:07.417 --> 02:08.750
We have no choice!

02:08.833 --> 02:10.708
Forward interceptors
on the Clarkstown are down!

02:10.792 --> 02:12.583
We can punch through the hull.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.042
Major, please.

02:14.125 --> 02:16.417
Let me get the gloves
off the firing team.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.667
Tell the aft batteries
to open fire.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.875
Command to squadron.
Fire in the hole.

02:26.958 --> 02:29.083
Repeat, fire in the hole.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.500
Aft batteries...fire!

02:33.625 --> 02:35.625
[intense music]

02:40.458 --> 02:41.708
[explosion]

02:46.250 --> 02:48.208
Clarkstown destroyed, major.

02:48.292 --> 02:50.542
Reloading fighters
as fast as we can.

02:50.625 --> 02:53.208
As soon as they're aboard,
make the jump to hyperspace.

02:55.083 --> 02:58.917
Bill...did you ever meet the
captain of the Clarkstown?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.917
No, sir.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.792
He and the general were
at the Academy together.

03:03.875 --> 03:05.583
Hague introduced me
to him last summer.

03:05.667 --> 03:08.000
He has a wife back home.

03:09.083 --> 03:11.125
'Three small children.'

03:11.208 --> 03:13.750
An Abyssinian cat...named Max.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.208
That's what makes
this war different

03:18.292 --> 03:19.708
from anything we've ever
gone through before.

03:19.792 --> 03:24.000
This time...we know
everyone we kill.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.625
I'll try to find something
to say to both of their wives.

03:30.708 --> 03:32.542
'God knows what.'

03:32.625 --> 03:34.792
Sir?

03:34.875 --> 03:37.125
Once we jump..

03:37.208 --> 03:39.500
...what's our course?

03:39.583 --> 03:42.833
[sighs]
We need time to make repairs,
catch our breath.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.500
There's only one place
safe for us.

03:46.583 --> 03:48.458
Set course for Babylon 5.

03:53.125 --> 03:57.375
(Ivanova)
The Babylon Project was
our last best hope for peace.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.750
It failed.

04:06.208 --> 04:08.833
[intense music]

04:18.083 --> 04:21.917
In the year of the Shadow War,
it became something greater..

04:22.000 --> 04:25.250
...our last best hope
for victory.

04:30.167 --> 04:32.583
The year is 2260.

04:32.667 --> 04:35.292
The place...Babylon 5.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.500
[theme music]

05:03.458 --> 05:05.375
[music continues]

05:23.667 --> 05:25.875
Bad news, people.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.917
We are five hours away
from a crisis situation.

05:30.458 --> 05:33.333
I just received a narrow-band
transmission from the Alexander.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.875
That's General Hague's ship.

05:34.958 --> 05:36.500
Hmm. He's suffered heavy damage

05:36.583 --> 05:38.458
And they need a place
to make repairs.

05:38.542 --> 05:40.083
And they're coming here.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.625
Well, we're screwed.

05:42.708 --> 05:44.458
Every ship in Earthforce
is hunting them down

05:44.542 --> 05:45.750
on charges of treason.

05:45.833 --> 05:47.083
As soon as they
come through the gate

05:47.167 --> 05:48.500
somebody's gonna send
word back home.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.458
- Once that happens--
- 'I know.'

05:50.542 --> 05:53.375
So I need you to put a cut-off
switch in the comm system.

05:53.458 --> 05:56.000
The second they get here,
shut everything down.

05:56.083 --> 05:58.083
Just leave us a private
channel in case we need it

05:58.167 --> 05:59.917
and the ISN feed.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.917
It's our only
lifeline to home.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.750
'We need to know
what's happening.'

06:05.375 --> 06:08.458
We all knew we'd end up in the
middle of this sooner or later.

06:08.542 --> 06:11.083
How far this goes,
we'll just have to see.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.583
All I know right now
is that Hague is arriving

06:13.667 --> 06:14.792
here in a few hours

06:14.875 --> 06:17.208
and hell is riding
in with him.

06:17.292 --> 06:18.917
Why didn't you just
bring him to Medlab?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.625
We can't allow anyone
else to see him.

06:20.708 --> 06:21.917
We believe
several bounty hunters

06:22.000 --> 06:23.333
are already here,
looking for him.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.417
We must slip him into
the station quietly.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.625
What happened?

06:26.708 --> 06:28.042
He has spent the last six months

06:28.125 --> 06:30.083
among the league worlds,
gathering information.

06:30.167 --> 06:32.750
He was on his way here
when he was attacked.

06:32.833 --> 06:34.750
Doctor, we cannot let him die.

06:34.833 --> 06:36.125
That's exactly
what's gonna happen

06:36.208 --> 06:37.792
if we don't get him
to Medlab right away.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.125
Security is very tight.

06:39.208 --> 06:41.167
The Narns are at all
of the customs areas.

06:41.250 --> 06:42.958
How do we know which
of them we can trust?

06:43.042 --> 06:44.625
(G'Kar)
'You don't..'

06:44.708 --> 06:46.167
...but I do.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.708
I'll get him past
the other Narn.

06:48.792 --> 06:51.250
Good. Give me a hand here?

06:51.333 --> 06:52.625
Unnecessary.

06:52.708 --> 06:54.167
Ambassador.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.500
Can you carry him very far?

06:58.583 --> 07:00.208
As far as you like.

07:03.417 --> 07:06.250
With the latest news
on the continuing crisis.

07:06.333 --> 07:09.125
Xavier Montoya, Head of the Mars
Provisional Government

07:09.208 --> 07:11.375
announced today that he
will not implement

07:11.458 --> 07:15.250
the martial law order given five
days ago by President Clark.

07:15.333 --> 07:17.833
So far, Earthdome has had
no official response

07:17.917 --> 07:20.167
to this act
of open defiance by Mars

07:20.250 --> 07:23.417
except to say that they are
considering all options.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.458
Is Garibaldi standing by?

07:40.542 --> 07:43.000
The cut-off switch
is in place and ready to go.

07:43.083 --> 07:44.542
Jump gate activated.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.292
We've got a ship coming through.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.333
Sheridan to Garibaldi. Kill it.

07:54.417 --> 07:55.875
(Garibaldi)
'Confirmed.'

07:55.958 --> 07:57.833
May I have your attention?

07:59.417 --> 08:01.167
'Your instruments are correct.'

08:01.250 --> 08:03.125
That's the Alexander.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.625
She's been in combat
for some time

08:04.708 --> 08:06.625
and we will render
full assistance.

08:06.708 --> 08:08.042
But, captain--

08:08.125 --> 08:09.917
The commander and I
are aware of standing orders

08:10.000 --> 08:12.458
concerning the Alexander
and her crew.

08:12.542 --> 08:15.250
We take full and
personal responsibility.

08:17.458 --> 08:20.250
Now, if anyone has
a problem with this..

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
...they're free to leave
the command deck.

08:33.125 --> 08:35.917
We have just been
thrust into the middle

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
of extraordinary events.

08:39.083 --> 08:42.833
So we must approach this
calmly and rationally.

08:42.917 --> 08:44.792
'Those are not the
enemy out there.'

08:46.667 --> 08:48.083
We wear the same uniforms

08:48.167 --> 08:50.792
and we've both sworn
to uphold the constitution.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.667
They're as loyal
to Earth as you are

08:55.750 --> 08:58.583
and we will render
humanitarian aid to them.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.667
Because..

09:03.750 --> 09:06.083
...as much as our humanity..

09:06.167 --> 09:08.000
...got us into this..

09:10.208 --> 09:11.500
...our humanity's the only thing

09:11.583 --> 09:13.500
that's going to
get us out again.

09:16.375 --> 09:17.708
Delenn..

09:17.792 --> 09:19.583
Take it easy, now. You're safe.

09:19.667 --> 09:23.458
No, none of us is safe anymore.

09:26.542 --> 09:28.333
The shadows are moving.

09:30.292 --> 09:32.792
They have made
alliances with many

09:32.875 --> 09:38.583
in the nonaligned worlds
and urged them to go to war

09:38.667 --> 09:40.458
with their neighbors.

09:40.542 --> 09:42.000
(Delenn)
'No.'

09:42.083 --> 09:43.833
Why would they
go along with this?

09:45.000 --> 09:48.250
They listened to the
shadows out of fear

09:48.333 --> 09:51.833
Afraid that if they
did not ally themselves

09:51.917 --> 09:54.708
with a greater force,
they would be conquered..

09:54.792 --> 09:57.458
'...by the Centauri.'

09:57.542 --> 09:59.000
But..

09:59.083 --> 10:03.000
...an alliance of defense
has now grown

10:03.083 --> 10:07.083
into the dream of conquest.

10:08.458 --> 10:11.417
They believe that as long as

10:11.500 --> 10:13.208
they are protected
by the shadows

10:13.292 --> 10:15.667
they cannot be defeated.

10:15.750 --> 10:18.833
And so they go to war
with one another.

10:20.583 --> 10:22.458
Has the Grey Council
been informed?

10:23.875 --> 10:26.167
The Grey Council has said..

10:27.875 --> 10:34.208
"...The problems of others
are not our concern."

10:37.375 --> 10:39.583
[intense music]

10:42.833 --> 10:44.208
- Captain.
- Major Ryan.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.250
Where's General Hague?

10:48.958 --> 10:52.250
General Hague was killed
in our last firefight.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.292
'We were coming back from
a meeting with some officials'

10:54.375 --> 10:57.375
'on Orion 7,
when we were ambushed.'

10:58.958 --> 11:00.375
'He was on his way
to the command deck'

11:00.458 --> 11:02.833
when we were hit amid
ships by the Clarkstown.

11:05.625 --> 11:09.250
In his absence, I've tried
to carry on as best I can.

11:11.958 --> 11:13.833
Between this and what's been
going on back home

11:13.917 --> 11:16.792
the crew is...just stunned.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.292
What's the latest on the coup?

11:20.375 --> 11:23.083
A few senators had
managed to escape Earthdome.

11:23.167 --> 11:26.500
Shock troops are out
in force everywhere.

11:26.583 --> 11:32.000
Paris, London, New York,
Moscow, New Delhi..

11:32.083 --> 11:34.417
How are the folks back home
dealing with all this?

11:34.500 --> 11:38.167
That's the irony. Most of them
have welcomed martial law.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.542
It's cut crime down to nothing.

11:40.625 --> 11:41.917
'On the surface, it's peaceful.'

11:42.000 --> 11:43.833
Yeah, the peace of the gun.

11:43.917 --> 11:45.708
Why haven't we seen any
of this on ISN?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.583
ISN is walking a fine line.

11:47.667 --> 11:50.458
They know if they push
too far, they'll be shut down.

11:51.917 --> 11:53.458
'We have one chance.'

11:53.542 --> 11:56.167
Mars has rejected Martial Law.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.583
If they can stand up to Clark

11:57.667 --> 11:59.208
they might be able
to rally support

11:59.292 --> 12:01.250
from some of the other colony
worlds and push him outta power.

12:01.333 --> 12:02.750
Unless he pushes back.

12:02.833 --> 12:05.417
No, he's overextended already.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.458
His power base is back on Earth

12:07.542 --> 12:10.458
where he has Nightwatch
and the bulk of our forces.

12:10.542 --> 12:12.292
I just can't believe so
many people in Earthforce

12:12.375 --> 12:13.917
would go along with all this.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.125
He spent the last year putting
his people in key places.

12:17.208 --> 12:18.625
Anyone who raises a voice

12:18.708 --> 12:20.625
is immediately arrested
and charged with treason.

12:20.708 --> 12:23.250
Under conditions like that,
it's..

12:23.333 --> 12:24.583
It's easier to keep quiet.

12:24.667 --> 12:25.750
[beeping]

12:25.833 --> 12:27.125
Yes?

12:27.208 --> 12:28.625
(Bill)
'We just intercepted
a coded message'

12:28.708 --> 12:29.958
'from Earthforce Command.'

12:30.042 --> 12:31.667
'They've started bombing Mars.'

12:31.750 --> 12:34.125
'I repeat,
they're bombing Mars.'

12:37.333 --> 12:39.250
(male #1)
'Standing by. Weapons hot.'

12:39.333 --> 12:40.833
(man over radio)
'Don't do it!'

12:40.917 --> 12:43.167
'We've got women and children
down here, don't do it!'

12:43.250 --> 12:45.292
(male #2)
'Omega One,
you're clear for drop.'

12:47.125 --> 12:49.792
[whooshing]

12:57.542 --> 13:00.167
Lennier, I'm leaving you
in charge in my absence.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.708
I will support
any action you take.

13:02.792 --> 13:03.833
Thank you.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.792
Delenn, please be careful.

13:06.875 --> 13:08.833
The Grey Council
is not what it was.

13:08.917 --> 13:10.125
They may not receive you well

13:10.208 --> 13:11.583
if they will see you at all.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.542
They will see me whether
they like it or not.

13:14.625 --> 13:17.250
It's time someone
made them face reality.

13:17.333 --> 13:18.792
Your ship's ready
to go, ambassador.

13:18.875 --> 13:20.333
We got you priority clearance.

13:20.417 --> 13:21.750
Seems like everyone's
trying to get outta here

13:21.833 --> 13:23.208
now that fighting's
broken out back home.

13:23.292 --> 13:25.417
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.042
G'kar, thank you for your help.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.083
I think you are no longer
quite the same person

13:30.167 --> 13:32.542
I met when I came here
four years ago.

13:51.750 --> 13:54.417
[intense music]

13:58.792 --> 14:01.417
(Ivanova)
'Captain, you better come
take a look at this.'

14:01.500 --> 14:03.542
We've got another
Earthforce Destroyer.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.000
Identification code
says it's the Churchill.

14:06.083 --> 14:08.667
Good. Major Ryan's
been waiting for her.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.458
She's hailing us.

14:10.542 --> 14:13.292
Repeat, this is the
Churchill to Babylon Control.

14:13.375 --> 14:15.333
- Do you copy?
- Right here, Churchill.

14:15.417 --> 14:18.250
Captain Sandra Hiroshi here.
Is Major Ryan with you?

14:18.333 --> 14:20.917
He's coordinating repairs
with our people.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.500
Do you want us to
get him on the link?

14:22.583 --> 14:23.792
Negative.

14:23.875 --> 14:26.250
I won't put this
on an open channel.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.500
Tell your people to stand by.
I'm coming in.

14:28.583 --> 14:31.042
And we've been unable to
determine at this time

14:31.125 --> 14:33.625
how many have been killed
in the recent attacks on Mars

14:33.708 --> 14:35.167
by Earthgov Forces.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.292
President Clark has announced
that the attacks will continue

14:38.375 --> 14:40.042
'until the Mars
Provisional Government'

14:40.125 --> 14:42.000
'accedes to Martial Law.'

14:42.083 --> 14:43.792
So far,
there's been no reaction

14:43.875 --> 14:45.708
From any of the outer
colonies concerning--

14:45.792 --> 14:47.083
(male #3)
'I'm sorry.'

14:47.167 --> 14:49.000
Jane, I'm sorry to
jump in like this

14:49.083 --> 14:50.375
but we have to..

14:50.458 --> 14:53.208
The colonies at Orion 7
and Proxima 3

14:53.292 --> 14:55.000
have just broken away
from the Earth Alliance

14:55.083 --> 14:57.333
in protest over the
bombing of Mars.

14:57.417 --> 15:00.125
They're setting themselves up
as independent states

15:00.208 --> 15:02.125
until such time
as President Clark is impeached.

15:02.208 --> 15:03.500
Rick, don't do this.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.417
Clark doesn't want this
information released

15:05.500 --> 15:07.125
but we have to go with this now

15:07.208 --> 15:09.833
because I don't know how much
longer we can stay on the air.

15:09.917 --> 15:11.667
Armed troops have
begun moving in

15:11.750 --> 15:14.542
on the ISN Broadcast Centre
here in Geneva.

15:14.625 --> 15:17.458
We just saw them
coming around the corner.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.417
'We're trying to get
a camera down there'

15:19.500 --> 15:21.333
'to document what's going on.'

15:21.417 --> 15:25.208
I-I can hear gunfire now
up here on the 14th floor.

15:25.292 --> 15:28.125
Listen to me, there's
information you don't have.

15:28.208 --> 15:30.000
What's been going on
for the last year

15:30.083 --> 15:31.542
we haven't been
allowed to tell you.

15:31.625 --> 15:33.000
[explosion]

15:33.083 --> 15:35.250
My God! Everybody get down!

15:38.083 --> 15:40.208
[indistinct chatter]

15:41.750 --> 15:43.833
Major Ryan? Captain?

15:43.917 --> 15:45.875
We just jumped in from Orion 7.

15:45.958 --> 15:47.333
They've declared independence.

15:47.417 --> 15:49.750
We've heard.
What's the reaction?

15:49.833 --> 15:51.875
Clark's afraid of losing
the other colonies

15:51.958 --> 15:53.458
'so he's sending
his elite forces'

15:53.542 --> 15:55.958
'to seize direct control
of any colony or outpost'

15:56.042 --> 15:57.042
'that might move against him.'

15:57.125 --> 15:58.625
If he finds out we're here--

15:58.708 --> 16:01.708
It's too late, he already knows.

16:01.792 --> 16:03.250
We intercepted attack orders

16:03.333 --> 16:05.500
relayed to the Agrippa
and the Roanoke.

16:05.583 --> 16:06.708
They're hooking up with some

16:06.792 --> 16:08.708
heavy reinforcements
on the way in.

16:08.792 --> 16:11.292
We'd better pull out before we
jeopardize Babylon 5 further.

16:11.375 --> 16:14.500
Major, the ships receiving
the attack order

16:14.583 --> 16:16.333
were already on their way here.

16:16.417 --> 16:19.375
He doesn't want to risk
Babylon 5 breaking away.

16:19.458 --> 16:23.917
So those ships are under orders
to seize command of Babylon 5

16:24.000 --> 16:25.667
arrest and detain its captain

16:25.750 --> 16:27.250
and the rest of
the command staff

16:27.333 --> 16:29.833
'and to put this station
under the direct authority'

16:29.917 --> 16:33.375
'of President Clark
and the Nightwatch.'

16:33.458 --> 16:35.042
(Ivanova)
'The other governments
won't stand for it.'

16:35.125 --> 16:36.542
(Ryan)
'They won't intervene.'

16:36.625 --> 16:39.625
'All the major powers
are divided, distracted'

16:39.708 --> 16:42.542
'busy with their own wars..
We're on our own.'

16:42.625 --> 16:45.208
(Hiroshi)
'Sorry to be the bearer
of such bad news, Captain.'

16:45.292 --> 16:46.917
But I thought you should know.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.750
How long until they get here?

16:50.833 --> 16:53.125
(Hiroshi)
'Six hours, tops. Maybe less.'

16:55.958 --> 16:57.417
I better get back to my ship.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.958
I should be there
when the others arrive.

17:00.042 --> 17:01.542
If you think it would
be any help

17:01.625 --> 17:04.042
we could try to jump, maybe draw
some fire away from Babylon 5

17:04.125 --> 17:05.458
give you a chance to negotiate.

17:05.542 --> 17:07.375
No. Thank you, major.

17:07.458 --> 17:09.167
If this is where
we'll make our stand

17:09.250 --> 17:10.917
then this is where
we'll do it.

17:18.292 --> 17:20.000
I know we are all
hoping to avoid

17:20.083 --> 17:21.583
a head-on confrontation
with Earth..

17:21.667 --> 17:23.500
...that somehow we could..

17:25.250 --> 17:28.458
...stop this train before
it went off-track.

17:28.542 --> 17:30.708
But this train
is heading right for us

17:30.792 --> 17:32.542
and there is not
a lot of time.

17:34.417 --> 17:36.458
So we have only two options.

17:38.875 --> 17:41.500
We fight..

17:41.583 --> 17:43.417
...or we surrender.

17:45.708 --> 17:47.125
Now, if it was just us..

17:47.208 --> 17:49.667
Hey, he pays your money,
he takes your chances

17:49.750 --> 17:52.125
but it's not just us.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.917
There's a quarter
million people here

17:54.000 --> 17:56.792
and billions more out
there counting on us.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.208
Now, I promised Delenn

17:58.292 --> 18:00.292
that we would draw
a line against the darkness

18:00.375 --> 18:02.667
no matter the cost.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.625
Well, now we know the cost.

18:08.292 --> 18:11.500
There's too much at stake
to walk away now.

18:11.583 --> 18:14.625
If we surrender,
they'll court martial us.

18:14.708 --> 18:19.292
If we fight and lose,
they'll probably kill us.

18:19.375 --> 18:21.208
They probably will, at that.

18:23.417 --> 18:25.250
So the choice is yours.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.583
I say fight.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.667
Fight.

18:36.208 --> 18:37.583
Fight.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.625
Fight.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.250
[dramatic music]

18:49.333 --> 18:51.167
While they try
to breach the hulls

18:51.250 --> 18:52.417
we'll need every warm body
we've got working security.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.417
Full weapons loaded.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.625
And what about the Narns?

18:54.708 --> 18:56.375
Them, too. G'kar's
guaranteed their loyalty

18:56.458 --> 18:58.875
and so far, he has kept
every promise he made.

18:58.958 --> 19:01.208
I want two fighter
squadrons on rotation

19:01.292 --> 19:02.542
starting 30 seconds ago.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.708
And put all backup
squadrons on full alert.

19:04.792 --> 19:06.583
If it can fly,
I want it loaded

19:06.667 --> 19:09.542
and ready to drop ten seconds
after primary launches.

19:09.625 --> 19:10.833
Done.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.292
Doc, if you have
got any patients

19:13.375 --> 19:14.958
that can be moved from Medlab,
do so.

19:15.042 --> 19:17.375
- We're gonna need the space.
- You'll have it in an hour.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.042
I need to make a call.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.792
Tell the Command Staff
to stand by.

19:20.875 --> 19:22.125
And see if you
can access Draal's

19:22.208 --> 19:24.750
Holographic system
on Epsilon 3.

19:24.833 --> 19:26.833
I have an announcement to make.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.292
I told you, Delenn,
they will not speak to you.

19:39.375 --> 19:41.250
Then they will listen to me.

19:42.958 --> 19:46.125
I served the council
for 16 cycles.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.750
I was the chosen of Dukhat,
to replace him.

19:48.833 --> 19:50.458
I held him when he died.

19:50.542 --> 19:52.250
His blood is on my hands

19:52.333 --> 19:57.167
his spirit in my eyes,
his word on my lips.

19:57.250 --> 20:01.875
You will step aside in
his name and mine, or..

20:01.958 --> 20:05.083
...in Valen's name, I will
tear this ship apart

20:05.167 --> 20:07.292
with my bare hands
until I find them.

20:07.375 --> 20:09.333
Move aside.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.458
Three years.

20:30.542 --> 20:34.792
For three years, I warned
you this day was coming.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.833
But you would not listen.

20:36.917 --> 20:41.042
Pride, you said. Presumption.

20:41.125 --> 20:43.292
And now the shadows
are on the move.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.833
The Centauri and the
younger worlds are at war.

20:45.917 --> 20:47.208
The Narns have fallen.

20:47.292 --> 20:49.667
Even the humans are
fighting one another.

20:49.750 --> 20:55.167
The pride was yours.
The presumption was yours.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.667
For a thousand years

20:56.750 --> 20:59.333
We have been awaiting
the fulfillment of prophecy.

20:59.417 --> 21:03.083
And when it finally happens,
you scorn it, you reject it

21:03.167 --> 21:05.542
because you no longer
believe it yourselves.

21:10.083 --> 21:14.667
"We stand between the
candle and the star

21:14.750 --> 21:17.083
between the darkness
and the light."

21:18.500 --> 21:22.333
You say the words,
but your hearts are empty.

21:22.417 --> 21:24.833
Your ears close to the truth.

21:24.917 --> 21:28.250
You stand for nothing but
your own petty interests.

21:31.917 --> 21:35.708
"The problems of others
are not our concern."

21:37.250 --> 21:40.375
I do not blame you for
standing silent in your shame.

21:40.458 --> 21:42.042
You, who knew what was coming

21:42.125 --> 21:45.125
but refused to take up
the burden of this war.

21:45.208 --> 21:47.500
If the warrior caste
will not fight

21:47.583 --> 21:50.208
then the rest of us will.

21:50.292 --> 21:52.750
The council has lost its way.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.542
If it will not lead.

21:54.625 --> 21:57.208
If we have abandoned
our covenant with Valen..

22:00.042 --> 22:02.250
...then the council
should be broken..

22:04.542 --> 22:07.083
...as was prophesied.

22:07.167 --> 22:12.000
We must stand with the others,
now, before it's too late.

22:12.083 --> 22:14.167
Between the worker caste
and the religious caste

22:14.250 --> 22:17.583
we control two thirds
of our forces.

22:17.667 --> 22:23.208
To you, I say, listen to
the voice of your conscience

22:23.292 --> 22:26.625
break the council,
and come with me.

22:26.708 --> 22:29.458
Our time of isolation is over.

22:29.542 --> 22:33.167
We move now, together,
or not at all.

22:37.042 --> 22:40.083
[intense music]

22:55.000 --> 22:59.375
[automated voice]
'Transmission sequence complete.
Stand by to receive.'

23:01.375 --> 23:04.542
- Hi, dad.
- John.

23:04.625 --> 23:06.750
Well, this is a surprise.

23:06.833 --> 23:09.667
I thought I'd look in on you
and see how you were doin'.

23:09.750 --> 23:12.000
Fine, fine.

23:12.083 --> 23:13.792
Having a few problems
with the corn.

23:13.875 --> 23:15.208
Been so damn hot lately

23:15.292 --> 23:18.333
the water doesn't get
a chance to sink in.

23:18.417 --> 23:22.125
Your mother still thinks I make
a better diplomat than a farmer.

23:22.208 --> 23:23.458
Where is mom?

23:23.542 --> 23:27.708
Oh, she had to go into town.
Errands to run.

23:27.792 --> 23:30.000
Some days, I don't know
what she does with her time.

23:30.083 --> 23:32.292
But if she's happy, I'm happy.

23:32.375 --> 23:33.625
'Listen, dad..'

23:33.708 --> 23:36.333
...um..

23:36.417 --> 23:38.833
...I wanted to call because..

23:38.917 --> 23:41.000
...well, there's a lot
going on right now

23:41.083 --> 23:44.208
and I don't know when I'll
be able to call again.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.958
It may be a while.

23:48.042 --> 23:50.833
I can't really explain
on an open channel, but--

23:50.917 --> 23:53.792
Son, I follow the news.

23:53.875 --> 23:56.167
Well, I did,
until ISN went black.

23:57.208 --> 23:59.083
I see what's going on.

24:00.458 --> 24:02.458
Your mother doesn't like
to think about it.

24:03.458 --> 24:05.000
You know how she is.

24:08.125 --> 24:11.875
John, I can't imagine
the kind of decisions

24:11.958 --> 24:13.958
that are going through
your mind right now.

24:15.083 --> 24:17.000
I'm sure they're not easy.

24:17.083 --> 24:19.000
The important ones never are.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.083
But when push comes to shove

24:22.167 --> 24:25.125
you've always done
the right thing.

24:25.208 --> 24:27.375
What was the first lesson
I ever taught you?

24:30.125 --> 24:34.167
Never start a fight,
but always finish it.

24:34.250 --> 24:36.208
You do what you have to do, son.

24:36.292 --> 24:38.083
Don't worry about us.

24:38.167 --> 24:41.583
The neighbors around here
like us, Lord knows why.

24:41.667 --> 24:43.375
So anybody comes for us

24:43.458 --> 24:46.250
they're going to have quite
a fight on their hands.

24:46.333 --> 24:48.917
Now I know you probably got
a million things to do

24:50.042 --> 24:52.292
so I'm going to let you
go and do them.

24:53.750 --> 24:55.167
And I guess, uh..

24:57.125 --> 24:59.208
...I'll talk to you
when I talk to you.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.417
Goodbye, dad.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.250
Love to you both.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.250
[indistinct chatter]

25:17.833 --> 25:19.333
(man over radio)
'Delta squadron fueled up.'

25:19.417 --> 25:21.458
'Ready to go.
Scramble, scramble!'

25:33.375 --> 25:36.208
[engines whirring]

25:42.000 --> 25:43.708
Alright, everyone, listen up.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.458
The commander and I
have prepared a response

25:47.542 --> 25:50.917
to the unconstitutional
actions taken against us

25:51.000 --> 25:53.792
and the Mars colony
by President Clark.

25:53.875 --> 25:55.833
Is Draal's holographic
system online?

25:55.917 --> 25:57.833
Just finished.
Stand by for scan.

26:04.625 --> 26:07.042
You're online. Go ahead.

26:07.125 --> 26:09.208
May I have your attention,
please?

26:10.708 --> 26:13.458
In the last few hours,
we have learned that warships

26:13.542 --> 26:15.917
are coming this way from Earth.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.625
Their orders are to seize
command of Babylon 5 by force.

26:20.708 --> 26:24.833
As Commanding Officer and
Military Governor of Babylon 5

26:24.917 --> 26:27.958
I cannot allow this to happen.

26:28.042 --> 26:29.833
President Clark has violated the

26:29.917 --> 26:34.208
Earth Alliance Constitution
by dissolving the Senate

26:34.292 --> 26:38.167
declaring martial law, and
personally ordering the bombing

26:38.250 --> 26:40.833
of civilian targets
on the Mars colony.

26:40.917 --> 26:44.000
'He is personally responsible
for the deaths'

26:44.083 --> 26:46.333
'of hundreds
of innocent people.'

26:46.417 --> 26:50.833
'Following these attacks,
Orion 7 and Proxima 3'

26:50.917 --> 26:52.875
'have broken away
from the Earth Alliance'

26:52.958 --> 26:54.542
'and declared independence.'

26:55.917 --> 26:58.667
Babylon 5 now joins with them.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.167
As of this moment

27:00.250 --> 27:03.833
Babylon 5 is seceding
from the Earth Alliance.

27:03.917 --> 27:06.750
We will remain
an independent state

27:06.833 --> 27:10.042
until President Clark
is removed from office.

27:10.125 --> 27:12.042
'At the end of
this current crisis'

27:12.125 --> 27:14.542
'anyone who wishes
to leave for Earth'

27:14.625 --> 27:15.833
'is free to do so.'

27:16.958 --> 27:20.208
Meanwhile, for your own safety

27:20.292 --> 27:22.625
I urge everyone to
stay in your quarters

27:22.708 --> 27:25.500
until this is over.

27:25.583 --> 27:27.083
That is all.

27:31.667 --> 27:33.500
Well, we're in it now.

27:34.833 --> 27:36.833
Should we ask Draal to
help with the defense?

27:36.917 --> 27:39.167
No, no,
he's our ace in the hole.

27:39.250 --> 27:41.833
I want to keep him a secret
as long as we can.

27:41.917 --> 27:43.917
This is our fight, not his.

27:45.375 --> 27:48.208
Alright, anyone who wants
to leave, do so now

27:48.292 --> 27:50.167
before you violate any regs.

27:58.542 --> 28:01.208
- You okay?
- I think so.

28:01.292 --> 28:05.042
It was kind of a surprise
but, yeah, I'm okay.

28:05.125 --> 28:06.750
Good.

28:06.833 --> 28:09.792
Captain, request permission
to join Starfury Squadron.

28:11.083 --> 28:12.208
Request denied.

28:12.292 --> 28:13.708
Captain, you're
asking those pilots

28:13.792 --> 28:15.125
to go against everything
they've been trained for

28:15.208 --> 28:16.833
and open fire
on our own ships.

28:16.917 --> 28:18.667
And one of us should
be out there with them.

28:18.750 --> 28:19.833
One of us has to be!

28:21.333 --> 28:23.333
You know I'm right.

28:27.083 --> 28:29.083
Go.

28:47.708 --> 28:50.042
Major Ryan, Captain Hiroshi.

28:50.125 --> 28:51.500
(Ryan)
'Right here, captain.'

28:51.583 --> 28:52.750
(Hiroshi)
'On line.'

28:53.875 --> 28:55.208
Stand by.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.500
[beeping]

29:13.583 --> 29:15.083
Jump-gate activated.

29:15.167 --> 29:16.583
Here they come.

29:18.542 --> 29:20.333
(Smith)
'This is Captain Dexter Smith'

29:20.417 --> 29:22.125
'of the Earth Alliance
Destroyer Agrippa'

29:22.208 --> 29:25.250
'to Babylon 5
and renegade ships.'

29:25.333 --> 29:27.708
'You're ordered to surrender
your commands and'

29:27.792 --> 29:29.583
'prepare to be boarded.'

29:29.667 --> 29:31.250
Launch fighters.

29:31.333 --> 29:32.833
(Smith)
'This is your only warning.'

29:32.917 --> 29:34.333
'If you do not surrender'

29:34.417 --> 29:36.792
'we will be forced
to initiate deadly force.'

29:38.250 --> 29:41.333
This is Captain John Sheridan,
Babylon 5.

29:41.417 --> 29:43.333
You are executing
an illegal order

29:43.417 --> 29:46.542
in violation of the Earth
Alliance Constitution.

29:46.625 --> 29:49.333
These orders have forced
us to declare independence

29:49.417 --> 29:51.542
in order to ensure
the safety of this station.

29:52.417 --> 29:54.500
We don't want a fight.

29:54.583 --> 29:56.375
But if you attempt
to carry out these orders

29:56.458 --> 29:57.833
we will defend ourselves.

29:59.667 --> 30:02.208
Come on, captain, you must
see these orders are wrong.

30:03.417 --> 30:05.375
Leave while you still can.

30:05.458 --> 30:07.000
They've broken contact.

30:07.083 --> 30:09.708
Enemy's Starfuries
moving on attack Vector.

30:09.792 --> 30:11.000
Orders.

30:13.083 --> 30:15.542
Babylon Control
to all Starfury Squadrons.

30:15.625 --> 30:16.750
Stand by to attack.

30:16.833 --> 30:20.375
But do not, repeat,
do not initiate combat.

30:20.458 --> 30:22.875
Let them fire first.

30:22.958 --> 30:25.625
We won't start this fight,
but, by God, we'll finish it.

30:25.708 --> 30:28.375
[intense music]

30:47.833 --> 30:49.500
[indistinct radio chatter]

30:51.500 --> 30:52.708
Forces closing.

30:52.792 --> 30:54.167
Entering firing range.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.625
Close blast doors,
and activate defense grid.

30:56.708 --> 30:58.042
Stand by.

30:59.542 --> 31:01.375
Don't be a fool, Smith.

31:01.458 --> 31:03.750
You've got to see
these are illegal orders.

31:03.833 --> 31:05.083
Don't make us do this.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.083
Enemy fighters have locked on.

31:07.167 --> 31:08.292
Firing.

31:08.375 --> 31:10.917
[gunfire]

31:18.667 --> 31:21.083
Alpha Squadron,
form up on my wing.

31:21.167 --> 31:23.958
Delta Squadron, punch us
a hole through there.

31:24.042 --> 31:25.208
(male #4)
'Confirmed.'

31:28.875 --> 31:31.583
Enemy fighters coming from the
side, trying to outflank us.

31:31.667 --> 31:34.833
Reset forward interceptors
for long range dispersion fire.

31:35.875 --> 31:37.083
Ready.

31:38.542 --> 31:39.458
Fire!

31:39.542 --> 31:42.083
[gunfire]

31:45.875 --> 31:47.417
Maintain approach!

31:55.542 --> 31:57.667
Direct hit to Decks 14 and 15.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.167
Hull integrity down 20 percent.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.542
Bring us in closer to the enemy.

32:00.625 --> 32:01.667
How close?

32:01.750 --> 32:03.208
Right down their throats.

32:08.083 --> 32:10.750
[intense music]

32:21.333 --> 32:23.125
We've got a
breaching pod coming in.

32:23.208 --> 32:24.625
Where's it going?

32:24.708 --> 32:26.292
Hull area, Brown 95.

32:27.417 --> 32:28.583
Garibaldi.

32:28.667 --> 32:30.083
Yeah, I heard. We're in
the area. On our way.

32:30.167 --> 32:31.583
Come on, move, move, move!

32:31.667 --> 32:33.542
We got to cut them off,
before they hit open ground.

32:33.625 --> 32:35.333
Let's go!

32:41.458 --> 32:43.167
Alright, take up position.

32:45.417 --> 32:47.208
We'll cut 'em off right here.

32:48.458 --> 32:50.750
Aw, nuts!

32:50.833 --> 32:52.208
Let's go!

32:55.333 --> 32:57.583
[explosion]

33:00.125 --> 33:02.500
Come on, come on, come on!

33:11.625 --> 33:14.417
[gunfire]

33:20.458 --> 33:23.333
[dramatic music]

33:38.917 --> 33:40.750
Three enemy Furies locking on.

33:40.833 --> 33:42.125
Hang on.

33:50.833 --> 33:53.208
[beeping]

34:00.917 --> 34:02.708
Give me a targeting
solution on the Roanoke

34:02.792 --> 34:06.125
and stand by to redirect
all defensive fire.

34:08.417 --> 34:10.625
[gunfire]

34:12.708 --> 34:15.167
Hang tight.
Coming around for another run.

34:15.250 --> 34:17.000
(Sheridan)
'Commander, the Churchill.'

34:21.375 --> 34:24.792
Hiroshi, get outta there.
Get to the life pods.

34:24.875 --> 34:27.792
(Hiroshi)
'Too late to get out.
Our primary systems are hit.'

34:27.875 --> 34:30.250
'We've got fire
on all decks now.'

34:30.333 --> 34:32.875
'There's nothing
we can do except..'

34:32.958 --> 34:35.708
Hiroshi? Hiroshi!

34:43.708 --> 34:47.208
[automated voice]
'Collision alert.
Collision alert.'

34:53.208 --> 34:55.167
(Sheridan)
'Ivanova, eject.'

34:55.250 --> 34:56.583
I can handle it.

34:56.667 --> 34:59.292
'Eject, damn it! Eject!'

35:09.208 --> 35:11.000
- We're in range.
- Fire!

35:11.083 --> 35:12.875
[explosion]

35:14.250 --> 35:16.917
[grunting]

35:31.292 --> 35:32.500
Fire!

35:34.292 --> 35:36.500
[dramatic music]

35:42.333 --> 35:44.667
Babylon control to Roanoke.

35:44.750 --> 35:46.125
Your ship is out of control.

35:46.208 --> 35:48.042
Surrender, and let us
take on prisoners.

35:48.125 --> 35:50.500
We promise safe passage to..

35:50.583 --> 35:52.958
[explosion]

36:01.542 --> 36:03.625
Damage report.

36:03.708 --> 36:05.167
Damage to all sectors.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.792
They're still fighting
in brown sector.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.042
Get some more troops
down there.

36:10.125 --> 36:11.917
- Hull integrity?
- Not good.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.417
EVA Team's en route.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.917
It's a good thing this
stopped when it did

36:15.000 --> 36:16.333
we couldn't take much more.

36:16.417 --> 36:17.875
[beeping]

36:17.958 --> 36:19.375
Oh, no.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.667
(Drake)
'This is Captain Drake
to Babylon 5.'

36:25.750 --> 36:27.958
'You are ordered to surrender,
prepare to be boarded'

36:28.042 --> 36:29.583
'by order of President Clark.'

36:32.417 --> 36:33.583
Captain.

36:34.875 --> 36:37.375
Jump points forming
right on top of us.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.875
- How many?
- Four.

36:56.500 --> 36:59.125
(Delenn)
'This is Ambassador Delenn
of the Minbari.'

36:59.208 --> 37:02.125
Babylon 5 is under
our protection.

37:02.208 --> 37:06.292
Withdraw...or be destroyed.

37:06.375 --> 37:08.208
(Drake)
'Negative.
We have authority here.'

37:08.292 --> 37:10.417
'Do not force us
to engage your ship.'

37:10.500 --> 37:12.042
Why not?

37:12.125 --> 37:13.583
Only one human captain

37:13.667 --> 37:16.625
has ever survived battle
with a Minbari fleet.

37:16.708 --> 37:18.375
He is behind me.

37:18.458 --> 37:20.625
You are in front of me.

37:20.708 --> 37:24.375
If you value your lives,
be somewhere else.

37:44.375 --> 37:46.250
All ships..

37:48.125 --> 37:49.875
...return to base.

38:18.292 --> 38:20.042
Alright, now,
take it easy, chief.

38:20.125 --> 38:21.417
Just take it easy. There..

38:21.500 --> 38:23.375
There. Put your weight on me.

38:25.417 --> 38:27.750
Give me this.
Give me this.

38:27.833 --> 38:30.208
Alright, alright. Slow it down.

38:34.833 --> 38:37.458
Just take it easy, chief.
You're alright.

38:52.458 --> 38:54.708
How many fighters
did you lose?

38:54.792 --> 38:56.542
Too many.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.000
At least 30 percent
of our Starfuries

38:58.083 --> 39:00.125
are destroyed or disabled.

39:00.208 --> 39:01.417
It's not likely we'll be getting

39:01.500 --> 39:03.125
any more from Earth
for a long time.

39:03.208 --> 39:04.333
Why?

39:04.417 --> 39:05.792
'When the Churchill
was destroyed'

39:05.875 --> 39:07.667
we took on as many
of her pilots as we could.

39:07.750 --> 39:10.417
The launch bases are damaged,
we can't hold many more.

39:10.500 --> 39:11.958
You could give them
a home here

39:12.042 --> 39:14.250
and bring your fighter
squadrons up to full strength.

39:14.333 --> 39:16.292
I think Captain Hiroshi
would've wanted that.

39:17.292 --> 39:18.625
I didn't know her very well

39:18.708 --> 39:21.500
But I'd be honored
to take care of her crew.

39:21.583 --> 39:23.167
[beeping]

39:23.250 --> 39:24.667
Yeah.

39:24.750 --> 39:26.083
(female #1)
'Captain, you wanted
to be notified'

39:26.167 --> 39:27.917
'when Ambassador Delenn
came aboard.'

39:28.000 --> 39:29.958
Thank you. I'll be right there.

39:31.458 --> 39:32.708
When do you have to jump?

39:32.792 --> 39:34.375
'Soon as I get
back to the ship.'

39:34.458 --> 39:36.125
We're both targets now.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.000
If we split up, it'll
give them less incentive

39:38.083 --> 39:40.083
to concentrate their fire here.

39:40.167 --> 39:41.458
And there are still
some ships out there

39:41.542 --> 39:43.583
who've signed on with us.

39:43.667 --> 39:46.375
We have to find them.

39:46.458 --> 39:49.125
Your people performed superbly,
captain. You should be proud.

39:49.208 --> 39:50.750
I am.

39:52.083 --> 39:53.417
Proud of what we did

39:53.500 --> 39:55.542
but not the reason
we had to do it.

39:58.542 --> 39:59.875
Good luck to you, major.

39:59.958 --> 40:01.667
'I don't know how long
we can hold the fort here'

40:01.750 --> 40:04.625
but as long as we can,
you're welcome here.

40:04.708 --> 40:06.125
Thank you.

40:08.667 --> 40:10.542
I think you're
forgetting something.

40:11.958 --> 40:13.458
No. No, I'm not.

40:15.208 --> 40:16.500
After what happened today

40:16.583 --> 40:18.583
I don't think I can
wear that for a while.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.583
Not with a clear conscience.

40:22.667 --> 40:25.958
No, when this is all over
I'll put it on again

40:26.042 --> 40:27.833
but not before.

40:34.667 --> 40:36.542
I didn't expect
to see you here.

40:36.625 --> 40:37.750
How's the leg?

40:37.833 --> 40:40.667
Doc says it'll heal.
Eventually.

40:40.750 --> 40:43.542
He's still checking out Ivanova,
but she'll be out soon.

40:43.625 --> 40:46.000
Figured I better be here
to let you know

40:46.083 --> 40:47.292
we started shipping
people out..

40:47.375 --> 40:48.667
...the ones that want to go

40:48.750 --> 40:51.042
and the ones we're
getting rid of.

40:51.125 --> 40:52.500
Nightwatch, mainly.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.083
We got all the
ones we know about, but..

40:54.167 --> 40:56.333
...that leaves all the
ones we don't.

40:58.458 --> 41:01.083
We're gonna have a problem
with sabotage for a while.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.083
Almost certainly.

41:07.333 --> 41:11.000
- Hello, John.
- Delenn.

41:11.083 --> 41:12.333
Uh..

41:13.750 --> 41:17.458
Listen, I've been trying
to think of some way

41:17.542 --> 41:19.792
to tell you how much
what you did

41:19.875 --> 41:21.917
means to me, and, uh, well..

41:23.500 --> 41:26.458
"...thank you" seems
poor and inadequate.

41:26.542 --> 41:28.958
I don't know how much
this cost you personally

41:29.042 --> 41:31.625
and I suspect I never will

41:31.708 --> 41:33.583
but I want you to know that..

41:35.708 --> 41:37.917
...seeing your face
at that moment..

41:38.000 --> 41:42.875
...was probably the single
finest moment in my life.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.250
It seems that this is the
only home we have left.

41:46.333 --> 41:50.958
How could I abandon,
as you say, my partner?

42:00.833 --> 42:02.042
(Ivanova)
'Ahem!'

42:02.125 --> 42:04.042
Oh, there you are.

42:04.125 --> 42:05.583
So how is she, doc?

42:05.667 --> 42:09.000
Well, we have a stubborn
patient with multiple bruises

42:09.083 --> 42:12.083
and a fractured rib, and a
bump on the back of the head--

42:12.167 --> 42:14.417
I'm fine.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.583
I just thought there's
something you should see.

42:35.042 --> 42:38.083
[clapping]

42:40.542 --> 42:43.042
[whistling]

42:43.125 --> 42:45.833
[cheering]

43:04.042 --> 43:06.208
[theme music]

43:22.750 --> 43:25.375
[music continues]
