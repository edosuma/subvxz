Being the best.

08:19.417 --> 08:22.377
Teachers dote on you.
Other students ask for your help.

08:22.461 --> 08:26.421
And an aura builds
and then you get accepted into ABA.

08:28.426 --> 08:31.096

you start thinking

Is he gay or straight?

13:19.800 --> 13:20.840
Straight.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.136
BOTH: Straight.

13:23.554 --> 13:25.354
Hey, you guys. Look.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.439
Hi, girls.

13:31.187 --> 13:32.807
Maureen, Anna.

13:33.022 --> 13:34.442
Hi, Kathleen.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.819
That was Kathleen Donahue, wasn't it?

13:38.903 --> 13:41.663
Yup. The Kathleen Donahue.

13:41.739 --> 13:43.949
Oh, my God. She's beautiful.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.498
Well, I think she looks
kind of like a gerbil.

13:47.578 --> 13:48.578
What?

13:48.662 --> 13:49.912
She does.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.122
She just married Mr. Reeves, right?

13:52.208 --> 13:53.918
Wait a minute. She married the director?

13:54.001 --> 13:55.001
Mmm-hmm.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.125
Now I get it.

13:56.212 --> 13:58.882
Yeah, this summer. It was a huge scandal.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.634
She'd been with
Cooper Nielson for a few years.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.426
And then one day, out of nowhere,

14:02.510 --> 14:04.930
she tells him
she's leaving him for Jonathan Reeves.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.642
No one even knew they were having an affair.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.679
And Cooper throws this huge fit in
rehearsal in front of the whole company.

14:09.767 --> 14:10.977
Calls her a slut and stuff.

14:11.060 --> 14:12.600
It was unbelievable.

14:12.686 --> 14:16.016
Then he drags his broken heart off to London
to dance for the season.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.146
Where rumor has it, he drinks like a fish

14:18.234 --> 14:20.284
and screws every girl in tights.

14:20.444 --> 14:21.494
He's back, you know.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.530
I know.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.413
I heard he hasn't spoken to anyone.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.120
He talked to me.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.280
What?

14:30.120 --> 14:32.620
You know, he, he offered
to help me with my bags.

14:36.669 --> 14:38.049
Bob, it's a benefit.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.968
If I give you an extra seat,
I'm taking money away from the Company.

14:41.048 --> 14:44.718
Besides, when was the
last time your paper ran anything on us?

14:44.802 --> 14:45.802
Oh, what the hell.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.636
Three seats under your name at will call,

14:47.721 --> 14:50.021
but only because I'm nice.

14:50.099 --> 14:51.979
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

14:52.393 --> 14:53.483
Well?

14:53.561 --> 14:54.651
Nothing to worry about.

14:54.979 --> 14:57.399
So, what's the competition?
What about your roommates?

14:57.481 --> 14:59.861
Jody's hopeless. She'll never make it.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.402
Is she the one from Boston?

15:01.485 --> 15:02.985
No, that's Eva.

15:03.654 --> 15:06.124
Eva's actually good. Amazing extension.

15:06.198 --> 15:07.738
But her attitude stinks.

15:07.825 --> 15:10.235
Jonathan hates her already, thank God.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.617
So you still think it'll be you,
Anna and Emily?

15:12.705 --> 15:15.915
Yeah. Although, have you seen Emily lately?

15:16.709 --> 15:18.169
Look at her.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.379
Hello, Emily.

There's a woman here whose husband
just died, leaving her $200 million.

And I will run it as I see fit.

you are free to leave.

Oh, Maureen, if you want to get calls,
please do so in the dorm.

29:06.329 --> 29:07.499
Don't give out this number.

29:07.580 --> 29:08.580
I didn't.

29:08.665 --> 29:10.575
Well, a Jim Gordon got it somehow

29:10.667 --> 29:12.837
and has been calling for you non-stop.

29:14.295 --> 29:16.875
Hi. What are you doing here?

29:18.508 --> 29:19.838
Nothing.

29:21.052 --> 29:22.682
I'm just waiting.

29:23.847 --> 29:25.427
I know. I wasn't myself today.

29:25.515 --> 29:28.555
I didn't get enough sleep last night,
so I was really tired.

29:29.352 --> 29:31.402
It's not just today, Jody.

29:31.896 --> 29:34.106
I see you three times a week.

29:34.357 --> 29:35.567
You're not improving.

29:35.650 --> 29:36.900
I can work harder.

29:36.985 --> 29:39.485
Oh, no matter how hard you work, there...

29:39.571 --> 29:43.201
There are certain realities
about you as a dancer that we have to face.

29:43.283 --> 29:45.833
We can wait till the end of the year,
when it's time for you to get a job.

29:45.910 --> 29:49.620
Or we can talk about it now,
while you still have options.

29:54.919 --> 29:57.129
You're not very turned out.

29:57.213 --> 29:58.803
So that needs work.

30:02.260 --> 30:03.890
And you don't have great feet.

30:05.346 --> 30:07.216
And while you're very pretty,

30:09.684 --> 30:11.314
you don't have the ideal body type.

30:11.853 --> 30:13.813
Margot Fonteyn didn't have great feet.

30:13.897 --> 30:15.357
When Margot Fonteyn was onstage,

30:15.440 --> 30:18.280
you couldn't tear your eyes away from her.

30:18.526 --> 30:19.736
(CHUCKLES)

30:19.819 --> 30:20.859
It can't be taught.

30:24.199 --> 30:27.699
In four months, we're gonna
put on a workshop in front of 3,000 people.

30:27.869 --> 30:31.499
It's an audition for
every major ballet company in the country.

30:33.416 --> 30:35.746
From what I've seen,
I can't cast you in that workshop.

30:37.212 --> 30:38.802
And if you're not onstage that day,

30:38.880 --> 30:41.630
you won't get a job,
not at ABC, not anywhere.

30:43.301 --> 30:45.551
So, what? Are you kicking me out?

30:46.137 --> 30:47.177
No.

30:49.432 --> 30:51.892
I just want you to really think

30:52.977 --> 30:55.437
if this is the right place for you.

30:57.357 --> 30:58.477
EVA: What a prick.

30:58.566 --> 31:00.026
He was perfectly nice about it.

31:00.109 --> 31:01.779
Yeah, but being nice
when you say something

31:01.861 --> 31:03.451
pricky is even prickier.

31:03.530 --> 31:04.990
MAUREEN: What if he's right?

31:06.199 --> 31:07.279
What?

31:07.992 --> 31:09.742
Let's be honest.

31:10.078 --> 31:12.078
You're not like most of the girls here.

31:12.163 --> 31:14.423
Your technique is nowhere near
where it should be.

31:14.499 --> 31:16.329
Hey, news flash, there's more to being

31:16.417 --> 31:18.207
a great dancer than perfect technique.

31:18.378 --> 31:19.878
Try dancing Swan Lake without it.

31:19.963 --> 31:21.463
Oh, God, I can't believe I'm hearing this.

31:21.548 --> 31:23.628
Look, you're really smart.

31:23.716 --> 31:26.676
If you send in your application now,
you could get into a good college.

31:26.761 --> 31:28.971
I don't want to go to college.
I want to dance.

31:29.847 --> 31:32.097
(SIGHING) Yeah, well, so do a lot of people.

31:32.183 --> 31:35.233
Jesus! What, you went to
a special bitch academy or something?

31:35.311 --> 31:36.441
I'm just trying to be honest.

31:36.521 --> 31:38.111
In my opinion, that's what friends do.

31:38.189 --> 31:39.189
Tell each other the truth.

31:39.274 --> 31:42.154
I guess that explains why you have
so many friends.

31:46.364 --> 31:48.704
If anyone asks, I'm in the library.

(DOOR CLOSES)

31:55.164 --> 31:56.334
Truth?

31:57.875 --> 32:00.545
In terms of technique, you are behind.

32:01.879 --> 32:04.379
But the people here know
what they're looking for.

32:04.465 --> 32:07.675
And on the day of your audition,
they saw it in you.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.680
Yeah, and now all they see
is the wrong body type.

32:11.556 --> 32:13.676
Oh, Eva, why can't I have your feet?

32:15.602 --> 32:16.852
(SIGHS)

32:16.936 --> 32:18.766
Okay. Enough of this. Get up.

32:18.855 --> 32:19.895
Why?

32:19.981 --> 32:23.281
Because all we ever do in this place
is take class.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.613
And it's about time we had a little fun.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.121
Hi, Maureen.

32:33.202 --> 32:35.292
Hi, Emily. How you guys doing?

32:35.371 --> 32:36.371
Fine.

32:36.456 --> 32:37.536
Good.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.710
So, has Maureen been really busy?

32:42.795 --> 32:45.255
I mean, she isn't seeing someone else, like

32:45.715 --> 32:47.295
Cooper Nielson or someone, is she?

32:47.383 --> 32:49.303
What do you know about Cooper Nielson?

32:49.385 --> 32:51.635
Hey, I've been doing my ballet research.

32:51.721 --> 32:54.271
We're not encouraged to date
company members.

32:54.349 --> 32:56.559
I fully support that policy.

32:56.893 --> 32:57.943
Look.

32:59.020 --> 33:02.940
All I came here to say is
I go to Columbia, pre-Med.

33:03.775 --> 33:07.735
I have a clean record,
impeccable hygiene and here's my number.

33:16.371 --> 33:17.501

33:17.580 --> 33:18.620
Come on, go.

Hey.

33:21.459 --> 33:23.879
The thing is, I've got priorities.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.260
You only get to be a dancer for 10 years.

33:26.339 --> 33:27.839
Maybe 15 if you don't get injured.

33:27.924 --> 33:29.474
So, for the next decade at least...

33:29.550 --> 33:31.930
Hey, all I'm asking for is a date.

for the winter.

"I remember you.

And he goes, "Please, come on,
I'll do anything. It really hurts."

So the mouse goes,
"Anything?" He says, "Yeah."

36:12.588 --> 36:14.668
He goes, "Okay." So he takes out the thorn.

up and starts doing the elephant.

to partner you in the pas de deux class?

It seems like a waste for him
to be partnering Jody.

It's fine. So anyway, he steps
on this thorn and it really hurts.

53:52.772 --> 53:54.612
(PIANO PLAYING STOPS)

53:55.483 --> 53:57.573
I want a clean double.

53:57.944 --> 54:00.324
I'm sorry. I thought
there was enough music for three.

54:00.405 --> 54:02.945
I mean, wouldn't it be better
if we all did a triple?

54:05.535 --> 54:08.195
A double. End of discussion.

54:09.414 --> 54:11.214

JULIETTE: That's much better, Nicole. Yes.

54:19.841 --> 54:21.761
Really give it size, ladies.

54:22.177 --> 54:24.347
Don't flap the wrists, Emily.

54:25.347 --> 54:26.347
Yes.

54:28.266 --> 54:30.186
Beautiful, Aesha.

54:33.688 --> 54:35.608
All right, ladies. Maureen.

54:35.690 --> 54:37.780
Good jumps, good elevation.

54:37.859 --> 54:40.899
But you'll really fly more
if it's from the heart.

54:43.615 --> 54:45.325
Who cares what she thinks, anyway?

54:45.408 --> 54:47.408
Juliette Simone, please.

54:47.494 --> 54:49.794
Her name's Julie Simon,
she grew up in Perth Amboy

54:49.871 --> 54:51.831
and her father managed a Wal-Mart.

54:51.915 --> 54:53.625
Just don't let it get to you.

54:53.708 --> 54:55.418
It doesn't mean a thing.

54:56.419 --> 55:00.419

casting's going up at 1:00.

ANNA: Daddy? I got the lead
in Italian Symphony.

55:28.910 --> 55:31.200
That's Gelsey Kirkland's old part.

55:31.413 --> 55:33.163
No. Maureen got the lead
in Jonathan's ballet,

55:33.248 --> 55:34.788
but that has way more people.

55:34.874 --> 55:37.214
Well deserved, sweetie. Aren't you pleased?

55:37.293 --> 55:38.753
Jody.

55:40.255 --> 55:41.965
Miss Thing, you're doing
a piece with the two of us.

55:42.048 --> 55:43.838
- What piece?
- A totally new ballet.

55:43.925 --> 55:45.005
- A world premiere.
- You're kidding.

55:45.093 --> 55:46.893
- Made on us.
- Who's choreographing?

55:48.096 --> 55:51.266
We can always find
some more rehearsal time later.

55:52.684 --> 55:54.064
Hi.

55:54.185 --> 55:55.595
This is for you.

55:56.479 --> 55:57.649
Thanks.

55:57.731 --> 56:00.691
I just want you to know
how much it means to me to be in your ballet.

56:00.775 --> 56:03.275
And I won't let you down.

56:04.446 --> 56:06.356
Well, you were the best for the part.

56:06.448 --> 56:08.068
Simple as that.

56:09.451 --> 56:11.491
It's some dessert. So, um...

56:15.832 --> 56:17.632
You'll have some on hand next time.

56:21.629 --> 56:22.669
Bye.

56:28.636 --> 56:29.636
What?

56:29.721 --> 56:31.391
I didn't say anything.

56:31.473 --> 56:32.563
Take these.

56:32.640 --> 56:34.980
Nonsense. You heard her.

56:35.060 --> 56:36.940
They're for next time.

56:42.734 --> 56:44.614
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

56:44.986 --> 56:46.526

56:46.821 --> 56:48.741
Yeah. Kind of amazing.

56:49.908 --> 56:51.578
It should be good.

56:51.993 --> 56:53.163
I guess.

56:53.328 --> 56:56.578
Jody says he has all these theories
about making ballet for the people.

56:56.664 --> 56:57.674
(SCOFFS)

56:57.749 --> 57:00.289
I do ballet 'cause
it has nothing to do with the people.

Give me tiaras and boys in tights any day.

57:09.177 --> 57:11.387
I hear you're in the corps
in Jonathan's ballet.

57:12.222 --> 57:13.222
Yup.

57:13.681 --> 57:16.521
Just goes to show, don't piss off the boss.

57:17.519 --> 57:20.059
No one will see me and I'll never get a job.

57:23.316 --> 57:24.646
I'm sorry.

57:25.735 --> 57:27.815
Big deal. I don't care.

57:28.696 --> 57:31.316
Yeah. I know.

57:46.589 --> 57:48.339
It sucks, doesn't it?

57:49.217 --> 57:50.257
What?

57:51.219 --> 57:52.599
Not caring.

57:54.639 --> 57:56.099
Kind of, yeah.

58:24.752 --> 58:26.922
Do you have a question, Miss Rodriguez?

58:27.380 --> 58:29.340
Yeah. What is it about?

58:29.924 --> 58:32.094
The music. The music.

58:33.178 --> 58:36.888
It's an expression of harmony
that isn't of this world.

58:39.184 --> 58:41.604
Sergei, chest up. Chest up.

58:44.272 --> 58:47.442
That's it. That's it. Soft hand.

Soft hand, Maureen. That's it.

I want this as real as it can be.
It's a triangle.

She's a ballerina,
and she's in love with you, Erik.

58:58.953 --> 59:00.293
And Charlie's the other guy.

59:00.371 --> 59:02.831
He's the director of a ballet company.

59:02.916 --> 59:06.036
Okay. Let's just fool around with the steps.
See what we got. Michael.

59:13.968 --> 59:16.548
Okay. Step, touch, step, touch.

59:16.638 --> 59:18.598
Pas de bourree. Double pirouette.

59:18.681 --> 59:19.891
All right, you keep doing that.

59:19.974 --> 59:21.064
You watch this.

59:21.142 --> 59:23.522
Do the double pirouette, down to the knee.

59:23.645 --> 59:25.935
Then give me your left arm.

59:26.147 --> 59:29.227
I'll slide you over here.

59:29.317 --> 59:32.737
And then, lift you up like this.

You don't like him very much, do you?

59:53.591 --> 59:55.221
I don't blame you.

59:56.970 --> 59:58.550
He's impossible.

01:00:00.265 --> 01:00:03.515
Headstrong, egotistical, unforgiving.

01:00:05.186 --> 01:00:07.016
Arrogant as all hell.

01:00:10.066 --> 01:00:11.606
The thing is, you'll be hard-pressed to find

01:00:11.693 --> 01:00:15.413
any choreographer or company director
who isn't like that.

01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:18.911
The unwise dancers blame them.

01:00:20.743 --> 01:00:22.953
"He didn't like me." "She was unfair."

when things get rough.

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:50.960
She's in my ballet.

01:08:51.045 --> 01:08:52.245
Please.

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:56.880
She's a heartbeat away
from tattooing your name on her ass.

01:09:01.721 --> 01:09:03.392
- Want to go to my place?
- Sure.

01:09:03.515 --> 01:09:04.555
All right.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.689
- See you.
- See you tomorrow.

01:09:08.187 --> 01:09:09.437
Where are we going?

01:09:09.522 --> 01:09:12.232
Night. Lexington?

01:09:14.234 --> 01:09:15.564
Good night.

01:09:23.285 --> 01:09:24.995
- Excuse me.
- Oh! Goodness.

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:27.078
No, my fault entirely.

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:30.497
It's a good thing I didn't step on
one of your feet, you could sue me.

01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:33.754
Don't worry. They're not as valuable
as they used to be.

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:35.877
So, how's Jonathan's ballet coming along?

01:09:35.965 --> 01:09:38.005
It's going to be beautiful. Really lovely.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:39.471
Oh! Good.

01:09:40.094 --> 01:09:41.854
Is Maureen feeling better?

01:09:41.929 --> 01:09:43.259
Better than what?

01:09:43.639 --> 01:09:46.059
She said she felt like she was coming
down with something. A bug.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.770
Oh! Right. Right, that bug.

01:09:49.478 --> 01:09:50.558
JONATHAN: Joan!

01:09:51.272 --> 01:09:53.942
What brings you here
to our humble part of the city?

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:57.235
Well, Cooper invited me
to watch his rehearsal.

01:09:57.862 --> 01:09:58.862
He did?

01:09:58.946 --> 01:10:00.736
(CHUCKLING) How nice
you two have kept in touch.

01:10:00.823 --> 01:10:02.783
Just a bit. You know.

01:10:03.117 --> 01:10:05.827
He's being nice to a tired old lady.

01:10:05.911 --> 01:10:08.121
Nonsense. Oh...

01:10:08.956 --> 01:10:10.116
Have fun.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.460
COOPER: Okay, guys, you've got...

01:10:12.543 --> 01:10:14.213
Let's take it from the bridge.

01:10:14.295 --> 01:10:15.875
(DRUMS PLAYING)

01:10:23.679 --> 01:10:24.889
Is that clear?

01:10:25.389 --> 01:10:27.639
Okay, Jody, you're right here.

01:10:29.393 --> 01:10:31.153
Yesterday I was stage left.

01:10:32.813 --> 01:10:34.483
Well, today you're stage right.

01:10:35.566 --> 01:10:37.686
What am I going to be tomorrow?

01:10:38.402 --> 01:10:39.652
Excuse me?

01:10:40.321 --> 01:10:41.911
Well, I mean, you keep changing your mind.

01:10:41.989 --> 01:10:44.119
It's kind of hard to keep track.

01:10:44.199 --> 01:10:45.739
It's not that complicated.

01:10:45.826 --> 01:10:48.076
I want what I say I want,
when I say I want it.

01:10:48.162 --> 01:10:49.662
You got a problem with that?

01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:52.367
Yeah. Maybe I do.

01:10:54.001 --> 01:10:55.791
What about what I want?

01:10:59.882 --> 01:11:01.342
(WHISPERING)
I don't give a shit what you want!

01:11:01.425 --> 01:11:02.835
You're a dancer. Period.

01:11:02.927 --> 01:11:04.137
You do what I want.

01:11:04.219 --> 01:11:08.559
And if you're not gonna do that,
then what the hell are you doing here?

01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:18.026
I'm afraid that's how ballets get made.

01:11:18.609 --> 01:11:20.819
It's all very dramatic.

01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:32.040
(SOBBING) Don't look at me.
I'm too embarrassed.

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:34.289
You were saying how you felt.

01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:36.205
What's embarrassing about that?

01:11:36.794 --> 01:11:40.134
How a dancer feels
doesn't matter to a choreographer.

01:11:41.548 --> 01:11:44.218
No, but how a woman feels

01:11:45.052 --> 01:11:47.512
should matter to the guy she's seeing.

01:11:52.059 --> 01:11:55.149
Do you think I'm an idiot
for getting involved with him?

01:11:55.854 --> 01:11:56.944
No.

01:11:57.147 --> 01:12:00.227
I think he's an idiot
for not treating you well.

01:12:01.902 --> 01:12:03.652
Come on. Let's go back.

01:12:04.029 --> 01:12:05.359
I can't.

01:12:05.447 --> 01:12:06.817
Sure you can.

01:12:06.907 --> 01:12:08.987
No. I'm all splotchy.

01:12:10.661 --> 01:12:11.831
I feel...

01:12:11.912 --> 01:12:13.252
So use it.

01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:15.621
What?

01:12:15.958 --> 01:12:18.338
Whatever you feel, just dance it.

01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:23.131
And you're not splotchy.

01:12:23.716 --> 01:12:24.966
(LAUGHS)

01:12:31.974 --> 01:12:33.314
(DOOR OPENING)

01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:39.111
I'm sorry.

01:12:40.983 --> 01:12:42.113
I'm ready.

01:12:44.695 --> 01:12:46.985
All right. Let's take it from the top.

01:12:48.115 --> 01:12:49.735
(DRUMS PLAYING)

01:13:37.706 --> 01:13:39.326
Good morning, Mrs. Cummings.

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:40.578
Good morning, Emily.

01:13:40.667 --> 01:13:42.627
Maureen, sweetie,
can I steal you away for a moment?

01:13:42.711 --> 01:13:45.171
- I've got class.
- This won't take long.

01:13:53.388 --> 01:13:54.428
Ow!

01:13:54.515 --> 01:13:56.675
Juliette says you've been off lately.

01:13:56.892 --> 01:13:58.272
You talked to Juliette about me?

01:13:58.352 --> 01:14:00.772
She sought me out. She talked to me.

01:14:02.856 --> 01:14:04.436
- She did?
- Yes, she did.

01:14:04.525 --> 01:14:06.145
She asked me if you were doing better,

01:14:06.235 --> 01:14:08.235
which means she noticed
you were doing poorly.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.160
A bug. For God's sakes,
it's not even a good lie.

01:14:15.202 --> 01:14:16.332
(SIGHS)

01:14:16.411 --> 01:14:18.411
I know what's going on, Maureen.

01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:21.917
You should ask yourself,
what's this boy doing to your dancing?

01:14:22.626 --> 01:14:24.086
(CHATTERING)

01:14:24.211 --> 01:14:25.631
(PIANO PLAYING)

01:14:25.712 --> 01:14:28.382
And the ladies have to make fifth
before the show starts.

01:14:28.465 --> 01:14:30.045
Stop! Stop!

01:14:30.175 --> 01:14:32.005
(PIANO PLAYING STOPS)

01:14:33.762 --> 01:14:34.932
Maureen,

01:14:36.348 --> 01:14:38.478
you make it look like work.

01:14:38.559 --> 01:14:41.939
I need to see the movement,
not the effort behind it.

01:14:43.063 --> 01:14:44.483
Thank you. We're out of time.

01:14:44.565 --> 01:14:46.275
We'll pick this up tomorrow.

01:14:46.733 --> 01:14:47.993
Emily.

01:14:51.738 --> 01:14:54.238
Can I see you in my office, please?

01:14:57.578 --> 01:14:58.658
GIRLS: Emily!

01:14:58.745 --> 01:15:00.245
- Emily!
- What happened?

01:15:01.957 --> 01:15:03.457
I'm going home.

01:15:04.418 --> 01:15:06.128
What did he say to you?

01:15:08.005 --> 01:15:10.415
He told me I couldn't be in the workshop.

01:15:11.049 --> 01:15:13.759
He told me that
I don't take enough pride in my body.

01:15:13.844 --> 01:15:15.184
He just thinks I'm too fat.

01:15:15.262 --> 01:15:16.512
God, I could kill that man.

01:15:16.597 --> 01:15:18.637
You're not fat! You're beautiful.

01:15:19.433 --> 01:15:21.523
So, you're... So, you're leaving for good?

01:15:21.602 --> 01:15:24.272
Yeah. My mom thinks it's best.

01:15:24.563 --> 01:15:26.693
Dancing used to make her happy
and it doesn't anymore,

01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:28.613
so we have had enough.

01:15:29.151 --> 01:15:30.401
I want you girls to promise me

01:15:30.485 --> 01:15:33.815
you won't let anyone
make you feel bad about yourself, okay?

01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:37.530
You're perfect the way God made you.

01:15:39.286 --> 01:15:40.946
We have to go, sweetie.

01:15:46.585 --> 01:15:48.455
(MAUREEN RETCHING)

01:15:55.969 --> 01:15:57.639
(TOILET FLUSHING)

01:16:08.148 --> 01:16:09.318
Look, uh...

01:16:11.568 --> 01:16:14.148
I know I'm not a doctor yet or anything,

01:16:14.696 --> 01:16:16.946
but I do know that
what you're doing is really bad for you.

01:16:17.032 --> 01:16:18.242
I wasn't feeling well.

01:16:18.325 --> 01:16:19.525
Maureen, please.

01:16:19.868 --> 01:16:21.158
(SIGHING)

01:16:21.453 --> 01:16:22.793
What do you know?

01:16:23.997 --> 01:16:26.537
I know that no goal is worth
making yourself sick.

01:16:26.667 --> 01:16:29.997
Yeah? Well, maybe my goal
is a little more demanding than yours.

01:16:30.545 --> 01:16:33.375
Medicine is plenty demanding, thank you,

01:16:33.465 --> 01:16:35.335
but I am not about to start
hurting myself for it!

01:16:35.425 --> 01:16:37.175
I'm not hurting.

01:16:37.261 --> 01:16:41.271
I'm making decisions,
sacrifices for what I want.

01:16:41.348 --> 01:16:43.138
Oh, like, like you know what you want!

01:16:43.225 --> 01:16:44.635
What's that supposed to mean?

01:16:45.143 --> 01:16:46.273
You know what?

01:16:46.353 --> 01:16:48.653
Call me crazy, but I find it hard to believe

01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:52.610
that a girl who is throwing up
everything she eats,

01:16:52.693 --> 01:16:55.863
is all that in tune with her wants and needs.

01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:58.700
You know what? I don't need this.

01:16:58.782 --> 01:17:00.162
Not from you.

01:17:00.284 --> 01:17:01.294
God.

01:17:01.535 --> 01:17:02.575
All right, look, I'm sorry.

01:17:02.661 --> 01:17:04.661
Please, don't go running
out of here in the middle of the night.

01:17:04.746 --> 01:17:06.116
Just back off!

01:17:06.206 --> 01:17:07.576
Maureen, listen to me.

01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:10.709
Wait. Look. I don't...

01:17:12.421 --> 01:17:14.091
I don't want to drive you away.

01:17:14.965 --> 01:17:16.255
I just want to help you.

01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:18.721
I don't need any help. I'm fine.

01:17:19.303 --> 01:17:23.143
I am the best goddamn dancer
in the American Ballet Academy.

01:17:23.557 --> 01:17:25.767
Who the hell are you? Nobody.

01:18:09.603 --> 01:18:14.273
If you let go of your center,
it will just happen, naturally.

01:18:27.287 --> 01:18:28.957
Now release the neck.

01:18:34.002 --> 01:18:35.212
Lovely.

01:18:36.922 --> 01:18:38.802
Do you want to show me again?

01:18:41.802 --> 01:18:43.302
You wouldn't mind?

01:18:44.012 --> 01:18:45.472
Not in the least.

01:18:46.306 --> 01:18:49.306
All right, boys and girls,
let's go to the opening diagonals.

01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:52.560
I know some of you are hearing
the orchestra for the first time,

01:18:52.646 --> 01:18:54.306
but it doesn't mean you can stop counting.

01:18:54.398 --> 01:18:55.568
You're all off the music.

01:18:55.649 --> 01:18:57.359
You must remember your counts.

01:18:58.235 --> 01:18:59.605
Keep going.

01:19:01.488 --> 01:19:02.488
Are you sure it's in here?

01:19:02.572 --> 01:19:04.162
That's what Sergei said.

01:19:04.241 --> 01:19:06.031
JONATHAN: I want to see
two straight diagonals.

01:19:06.118 --> 01:19:08.118

This is a rehearsal, not a social hour!

I've never been in the paper before.

01:19:25.679 --> 01:19:27.309
I know. Me neither.

01:19:27.389 --> 01:19:29.349
It's kind of cool, huh?

01:19:30.851 --> 01:19:32.521
Are you guys warmed up?

01:19:33.437 --> 01:19:34.647
Of course.

01:19:35.856 --> 01:19:38.356
Five, six, seven, eight. One...

01:19:38.775 --> 01:19:40.025
We don't invite press to workshop.

01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:41.450
You know that.

01:19:41.778 --> 01:19:43.108
I didn't invite anyone.

01:19:43.196 --> 01:19:45.366
Nancy says every paper has called,

01:19:45.449 --> 01:19:47.619
and all they ask about is your ballet.

01:19:48.326 --> 01:19:51.456
Hey, if there's interest, that's great,
but other than that...

01:19:51.538 --> 01:19:52.658
Bullshit!

She hasn't shown any interest
in the Company

01:20:00.505 --> 01:20:02.335

01:20:20.317 --> 01:20:21.487
Man, I'm so sorry.

01:20:22.402 --> 01:20:24.912
Well, you'd better start rehearsing
the understudy.

01:20:25.447 --> 01:20:27.657
It's Andre. He's not good enough.

01:20:27.741 --> 01:20:28.831
I can't use him.

Oh, no, no, no Yeah, baby

01:38:20.312 --> 01:38:22.902
Oh, oh, oh

01:38:22.982 --> 01:38:27.242
I see the way he treats you

01:38:27.528 --> 01:38:30.238
I feel the tears you cry

01:38:30.322 --> 01:38:34.492
And it makes me sad and it makes me mad

01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:38.580
There's nothing I can do, baby

01:38:39.999 --> 01:38:43.129
'Cause your lover is my best friend

01:38:43.210 --> 01:38:46.840
And I guess that's where the story ends

01:38:47.548 --> 01:38:51.838
So I've gotta try to keep it inside

01:38:51.927 --> 01:38:56.177
You will never be never be mine

01:38:56.765 --> 01:39:00.975
If I was the one who was loving you, baby

01:39:01.061 --> 01:39:05.021
The only tears you'd cry
would be tears of joy

01:39:05.107 --> 01:39:09.147
And if I was by your side

01:39:09.486 --> 01:39:13.866
You'd never know one lonely night

01:39:13.949 --> 01:39:18.159
And if it was my arms you were running to

01:39:18.245 --> 01:39:21.035
I'd give you love in these arms of mine

01:39:22.625 --> 01:39:27.795
If I was the one in your life

01:39:28.464 --> 01:39:31.804
Yeah, baby

01:39:32.217 --> 01:39:36.757
I wanna reach out and view you beside me

01:39:36.847 --> 01:39:39.597
Right here beside me, babe

01:39:39.683 --> 01:39:43.653
Take you in my arms right now

01:39:43.729 --> 01:39:47.519
Scream, "I love you" right out loud

01:39:48.233 --> 01:39:52.283
Someday I pray that I'll find the strength

01:39:52.363 --> 01:39:56.833
To turn to you and say

01:39:56.909 --> 01:40:01.159
If I was the one who was loving you, baby

01:40:01.246 --> 01:40:05.496
The only tears you'd cry
would be tears of joy

01:40:05.584 --> 01:40:09.674
If I was by your side

01:40:09.755 --> 01:40:14.005
You'd never know one lonely night

01:40:14.093 --> 01:40:18.103
And if it was my arms you were running to

01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:22.310
I'd give you love in these arms of mine

01:40:22.726 --> 01:40:26.896
If I was the one, baby

01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:31.150
If I were the one

01:40:31.235 --> 01:40:37.735

I feel the thunder see the lightning

01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:11.569
I know this anger's heaven sent

01:41:11.650 --> 01:41:15.740
So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups

01:41:15.821 --> 01:41:18.281
Because on the boogie I feel so hell bent

01:41:18.365 --> 01:41:19.735
Hey, hey

gut reaction that I got

- Are you crazy?
- I wanted to tell you.

01:44:18.879 --> 01:44:20.879
- Are you nuts?
- I'm sorry.

Ah! There you are.

01:44:23.342 --> 01:44:25.342
Cooper, darling, you were wonderful.

You were beautiful.

Excuse me. I have the small rehearsal room.

Do you want the girls first or the boys?

Girls.

Mom! Oh, I'm so happy you guys are here.

01:45:11.932 --> 01:45:14.852
Come on. We wanted to see
what you've been up to this past year.

01:45:14.935 --> 01:45:17.475
- Dad!
- And I've got to tell you,

01:45:17.562 --> 01:45:20.862
that was the most
fantastic thing I've ever seen.

01:45:20.983 --> 01:45:24.573
It was great, honey. Just, just wonderful.

01:45:25.404 --> 01:45:27.574
You want to know something stupid?

01:45:27.656 --> 01:45:30.526
I'd actually started to believe
I didn't need to hear that anymore.

01:45:30.617 --> 01:45:33.497
(SCREAMS) I made it! I made it!

01:45:56.101 --> 01:45:58.941
JONATHAN: What you did today
was completely disrespectful.

01:46:00.939 --> 01:46:02.069
I'm sorry.

01:46:03.608 --> 01:46:05.028
Yeah.

01:46:07.279 --> 01:46:09.199
Or actually, I'm not.

01:46:09.281 --> 01:46:12.741
Because that was
the best time I ever had in my life.

01:46:12.826 --> 01:46:16.956
Jesus! That's a great ballet, Jonathan.
You know that?

01:46:17.289 --> 01:46:19.919
Thank you. And you were great in it.

01:46:23.253 --> 01:46:25.463
And I'd like to have you
as a member of the Company.

01:46:26.381 --> 01:46:27.591
If you'll join us.

01:46:33.847 --> 01:46:34.967
Are you nuts?

01:46:35.057 --> 01:46:37.137
I hope not, but that depends entirely
on you, doesn't it?

01:46:48.153 --> 01:46:49.653
Hey, guess what?

01:46:50.572 --> 01:46:51.742
I just talked to Joan Miller.

01:46:51.823 --> 01:46:53.953
She loved the ballet
and wants to fund my company.

01:46:54.034 --> 01:46:56.044
- I'm going to have my own company.
- You're kidding.

01:46:56.119 --> 01:46:58.159
- No.
- God, congratulations.

01:47:00.082 --> 01:47:02.832
Listen, you have to be in my company.

01:47:03.877 --> 01:47:05.457
You'll be its star.

01:47:05.670 --> 01:47:07.300
We'll be great together.

01:47:09.841 --> 01:47:10.931
Jody,

01:47:13.303 --> 01:47:15.223
they're ready for you.

01:47:39.788 --> 01:47:40.788
Jody.

01:47:41.206 --> 01:47:42.246
Wait.

01:47:44.626 --> 01:47:47.206
For ten years, all I have wanted

01:47:47.295 --> 01:47:50.875
was to be one of American Ballet
Company's perfect ballerinas.

01:47:52.509 --> 01:47:54.589
I've wanted to be you, Juliette.

01:47:55.428 --> 01:47:57.178
But I'm not you.

01:47:58.181 --> 01:48:00.481
And I'm not perfect. I'm just me.

01:48:01.476 --> 01:48:03.016
Bad feet and all.

01:48:03.103 --> 01:48:06.313
And I'm starting to think
I like that even better.

01:48:08.567 --> 01:48:10.937
No. Please don't.

01:48:12.571 --> 01:48:14.991
Because if you're not
gonna offer me a place in the Company,

01:48:15.073 --> 01:48:17.083
then I don't want to hear it.

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.790
And if you are,

01:48:21.454 --> 01:48:23.624
I might not have the strength to say no.

01:48:24.541 --> 01:48:26.501
And then I'd be spending
my best dancing years

01:48:26.585 --> 01:48:29.915
in the back of a corps,
waving a rose back and forth.

01:48:30.005 --> 01:48:31.625
And I'm better than that.

01:48:33.091 --> 01:48:37.891
So thank you, Jonathan,
for turning me into the best dancer I can be.

01:48:37.971 --> 01:48:40.561
I appreciate it more
than I can say it, really.

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:44.140
Because the best dancer
I can be is a principal

01:48:44.227 --> 01:48:47.607
in Cooper Nielson's new company.

01:49:04.789 --> 01:49:05.999
Erik!

01:49:07.292 --> 01:49:09.422
Girl, you are too many things.

01:49:09.502 --> 01:49:11.052
I cannot believe it.

01:49:11.129 --> 01:49:14.049
I know. I really think
Jonathan should have his head examined.

01:49:14.132 --> 01:49:17.262
Oh, yeah, because he's taking
head cases and cripples.

01:49:18.053 --> 01:49:20.263
- You're in?
- Yes. Bum foot and all!

01:49:20.347 --> 01:49:21.677
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:49:21.765 --> 01:49:22.965
Maureen, you could have told me.

01:49:23.058 --> 01:49:25.688
Sergei, I am so sorry.
I really wanted to tell you.

01:49:25.769 --> 01:49:28.729
It's okay. It's okay.
I got San Francisco with Galina.

01:49:28.813 --> 01:49:31.693
- Oh! That's perfect.
- That's great. Congrats, bud.

01:49:31.775 --> 01:49:33.235
Thanks. I'll catch up with you later.

01:49:33.318 --> 01:49:34.858
Congratulations. (LAUGHS)

01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:36.820
Hey!

01:49:40.242 --> 01:49:42.372
Everyone says you were beautiful.

01:49:42.494 --> 01:49:44.164
You didn't watch?

01:49:45.872 --> 01:49:47.542
Are you all right?

01:49:48.333 --> 01:49:51.173
Not really. No. But I will be.

01:49:51.544 --> 01:49:53.384
- Eva!
- Hey!

01:49:53.463 --> 01:49:54.463
You will be.

01:49:54.547 --> 01:49:56.297
Erik. What did you think?

01:49:56.383 --> 01:49:59.013
You were okay, for an understudy.

01:49:59.094 --> 01:50:01.644
- I did what I could. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

01:50:01.721 --> 01:50:03.271
I hear you got yourself a spot here.

01:50:03.348 --> 01:50:06.478
Yup. And I hear you got yourself
a principal dancer.

01:50:09.104 --> 01:50:10.114
Are you with me?

01:50:10.188 --> 01:50:11.268
I'm with you.

01:50:11.356 --> 01:50:12.686
(LAUGHING)

01:50:15.026 --> 01:50:17.026
You're not going to regret this.

01:50:19.614 --> 01:50:22.414
Cooper, you're an amazing dancer

01:50:22.492 --> 01:50:25.082
and you're a great choreographer,

01:50:25.745 --> 01:50:29.455
