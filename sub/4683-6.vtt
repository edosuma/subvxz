WEBVTT

01:04.566 --> 01:06.866
Let's do it. Wait.

01:13.066 --> 01:14.033
Here we go.

01:19.733 --> 01:22.233
- Yeah! Alright!
- Alright.

01:22.300 --> 01:23.600
You know, I think
we got a pretty good shot

01:23.666 --> 01:25.800
against Wickman Insurance
this year.

01:28.666 --> 01:30.800
'Huh, guess they're
big hockey fans.'

01:30.866 --> 01:33.466
Hey, Gordon, Gordon, Gordon,
catch this.

01:33.533 --> 01:35.466
They're on their knees.

01:41.133 --> 01:42.100
'Wow, look at Angela.'

01:42.166 --> 01:43.166
'She's got
the rest of those girls'

01:43.233 --> 01:44.666
'so outclassed.'

01:44.733 --> 01:46.700
She's beautiful and smart.

01:48.133 --> 01:49.800
'The way she glides
around out there'

01:49.866 --> 01:50.833
'it's like she's dancing.'

01:50.900 --> 01:52.766
'Every single move
is so graceful.'

01:52.833 --> 01:54.866
'Oh, please.'

01:54.933 --> 01:57.600
'I mean it. She's like, watching
a ballerina. She's perfect.'

01:57.666 --> 02:01.033
'Like a work of art,
like something out of a dream.'

02:01.100 --> 02:02.700
'You know, I'm surprised,
she can skate it all'

02:02.766 --> 02:04.633
'on that poor pedestal
you got her on.'

02:04.700 --> 02:06.533
'A girl like that
deserves to be the pedestal.'

02:08.500 --> 02:10.966
Oh, would you forget her?

02:11.033 --> 02:13.200
'She's just, she's just another
girl, not some Goddess.'

02:13.266 --> 02:15.900
'You don't know her.'

02:15.966 --> 02:17.633
'I-I keep forgetting
how tight you two are.'

02:17.700 --> 02:20.366
We have a very special
relationship.

02:20.433 --> 02:23.466
Hey, you asked her out twice,
and she turned you down twice.

02:23.533 --> 02:25.000
'You know, I'm-I'm
no big expert on romance'

02:25.066 --> 02:27.433
'but I think she may be trying
to tell you something.'

02:27.500 --> 02:28.833
It's just that,
you know, she doesn't go out

02:28.900 --> 02:30.200
with guys at work, that's all.

02:30.266 --> 02:33.100
'She doesn't want people
to think that she's, you know..'

02:33.166 --> 02:34.500
'Dating her way to the top?'

02:34.566 --> 02:36.533
'She's got a reputation
to think of.'

02:38.800 --> 02:39.933
Oh, then I guess Schneider's got

02:40.000 --> 02:41.600
some kind of executive
exemption.

02:43.033 --> 02:45.366
How could she do this?
He's suck a jerk.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.266
'Yeah, but he's a jerk
with a future.'

02:48.333 --> 02:49.966
'Why bother with a couple
of juniors sales reps'

02:50.033 --> 02:51.866
when you can have
the vice president?

02:51.933 --> 02:56.033
He's nothing but
a brown-nosing corporate creep.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.233
'I know, well she's just going'

02:57.300 --> 02:59.966
for the gold,
like everybody else.

03:00.033 --> 03:02.800
I'm sure they all want
a sensitive, caring kind of guy.

03:02.866 --> 03:04.500
Mostly the sensitive,
caring kind of guy

03:04.566 --> 03:05.800
who earn six figures a year.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.433
What do you want
with an uptight secretary

03:12.500 --> 03:13.666
when we have
creatures like that?

03:13.733 --> 03:16.133
Oh, yeah, look at her.

03:16.200 --> 03:19.600
Young and healthy.
And she can really skate.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.933
Hmm.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.533
Oh, I'd like to slip my puck
past her little blue line.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.466
'That's one natural
and one free spirit'

03:29.533 --> 03:31.500
'and earthy andveryi

03:33.766 --> 03:35.566
'Well, that takes
incredible muscle control.'

03:35.633 --> 03:37.000
'And-and a certain amount
of courage.'

03:37.066 --> 03:38.166
'Courage?'

03:38.233 --> 03:39.633
'Yeah, hey,
this is a public place.'

03:39.700 --> 03:41.633
'It takes guts to be
that free and open.'

03:44.833 --> 03:46.800
Hey, pal.
This is your lucky night.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.433
'She can come on
to you for weeks.'

03:53.666 --> 03:55.433
She's not my type.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.033
Oh, well, excuse me.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.366
I'm sorry, I forgot
you wouldn't be content

03:58.433 --> 04:00.800
with just a...better
than average looking chick.

04:00.866 --> 04:01.966
You have to have Miss Perfect.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.300
It's just
a personal preference, okay?

04:04.366 --> 04:06.533
Oh, sure, if you're
fightin' 'em off.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.833
But you're not.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.500
Look, face it. The girls
you want, don't want you.

04:12.933 --> 04:14.566
Thanks, pal.

04:14.633 --> 04:16.466
Hey, look,
I'm being your friend.

04:16.533 --> 04:18.633
Just kiss your fantasy goodbye
and get real.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.100
Get..

04:22.300 --> 04:23.666
'Now t-that's real.'

04:23.733 --> 04:25.866
'But-but no, you gotta keep
looking for a blonde Goddess'

04:25.933 --> 04:28.300
'so perfect that she'd have to
be programed by a computer.'

05:34.700 --> 05:38.400
Hope he didn't buy off
more than he can chew.

05:47.633 --> 05:49.166
So you're looking
for an attractive young woman

05:49.233 --> 05:50.333
to share your life with.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.066
Someone who is willing
to commit themselves

05:53.133 --> 05:55.933
to a loving but
monogamous relationship.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.300
Yeah.

05:57.366 --> 05:59.333
On the weekends, anyway.

06:01.966 --> 06:04.233
If you'll come right over here,
Gordon..

06:04.300 --> 06:08.033
Gordon, Gordo? Gordy.
Yes, that's much better.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.733
Sit down, right over here, Gordy

06:09.800 --> 06:12.400
so we can do
a video presentation.

06:12.466 --> 06:14.166
Is this extra?

06:14.233 --> 06:15.933
The video
and all the other extras

06:16.000 --> 06:18.500
are included in
our "Saturday Night Special."

06:21.100 --> 06:24.366
Now, we don't get a second
chance at first impression

06:24.433 --> 06:26.400
so it's very important

06:26.466 --> 06:30.033
that we show you
in your very best light.

06:34.833 --> 06:36.100
Relax.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.166
Just look into the camera.

06:45.466 --> 06:47.333
Sit straight, not stiff.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.400
That's it.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.033
Smile.

06:54.566 --> 06:56.033
Too much.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.800
Good.

07:03.166 --> 07:05.733
You're squinting, Gordy.
Don't squint.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.700
'Now, you're gonna tell us
all about your life.'

07:10.766 --> 07:14.133
'Very naturally. Just as if you
were sitting in your own home.'

07:16.133 --> 07:17.733
We're rolling tape.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.000
Okay, um..

07:21.633 --> 07:24.000
Hi, I'm Gordon.

07:25.133 --> 07:26.466
Gordy.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.200
Okay. Hi, I'm Gordy.

07:30.066 --> 07:31.700
Hi, I'm Gordy.

07:31.766 --> 07:33.900
And I work for, um

07:33.966 --> 07:35.800
Springwood Mutual Causality
And Life--

07:35.866 --> 07:38.966
- Cut.
- What?

07:39.033 --> 07:41.066
I think we can do
better than that.

07:41.133 --> 07:43.000
But that's what I do,
I sell insurance.

07:43.066 --> 07:45.100
'But that's not what
you'd really like to be doing.'

07:45.166 --> 07:47.500
That's not who
you'd really like to be.

07:47.566 --> 07:49.833
No! No, I would rather be,
uh, Van Halen.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.866
Traveling around the country,
and-and-and playing drums

07:52.933 --> 07:54.233
and fighting off groupies.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.800
Heavy metal.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.066
No, that's a wrong image.

07:57.133 --> 07:59.633
What? Even my-my fantasies
aren't classy enough?

08:00.566 --> 08:02.533
Not for the kind of girl
you want.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.533
'Of course these things
are negotiable'

08:04.600 --> 08:06.866
but only to a certain point.

08:06.933 --> 08:08.600
'If you want a thoroughbred'

08:08.666 --> 08:10.733
'you have to be willing to pay
for thoroughbred.'

08:10.800 --> 08:12.466
So you want me to lie?

08:12.533 --> 08:14.100
You're a salesman, Gordy.

08:14.166 --> 08:16.066
You're a professional liar

08:16.133 --> 08:17.766
Your job is to convince people

08:17.833 --> 08:19.466
that they want things,
they don't really need

08:19.533 --> 08:20.500
and they can't really afford.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.100
Well, yeah, but this doe..

08:22.166 --> 08:24.500
This is different.
This does not seem ethical.

08:24.566 --> 08:26.233
Unlike selling life insurance

08:26.300 --> 08:28.033
betting the customers gonna live

08:28.100 --> 08:31.066
while you con them
into paying monthly premiums

08:31.133 --> 08:33.800
on the chance,
he might just get lucky

08:33.866 --> 08:35.033
and die.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.033
That's some jackpot.

08:39.266 --> 08:41.000
So, let's see if we can come up

08:41.066 --> 08:43.633
with something
a little more upscale.

08:43.700 --> 08:47.333
Something that requires
a Harvard degree.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.966
But I didn't even graduate from
Springwood Community College.

08:51.033 --> 08:53.000
I mean,
what do you want me to say?

08:53.066 --> 08:56.700
And then, after graduating
from the University of Minnesota

08:57.766 --> 09:00.733
with degrees
in Business and Law..

09:02.033 --> 09:03.633
...I was drafted by
the Canadian Hockey League

09:03.700 --> 09:05.433
where I played for Montreal.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.733
And...although I love the game..

09:09.800 --> 09:12.633
...and our neighbors
to the north..

09:12.700 --> 09:14.300
...I knew that
I had to return home.

09:14.366 --> 09:16.933
I knew, that I had to make

09:18.166 --> 09:20.133
my American dream come true.

09:21.866 --> 09:25.066
And that's when I started my
international banking business.

09:25.133 --> 09:26.600
That doesn't even look like me.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.166
You're right.
Lying can do wonders.

09:29.233 --> 09:32.200
...financial empire
is a success.

09:32.266 --> 09:33.966
I've realized that..

09:34.033 --> 09:37.300
...no matter
how many millions...I make

09:39.000 --> 09:40.933
'I can only drive
one Porsche at a time.'

09:42.966 --> 09:45.233
And sometimes..

09:45.300 --> 09:47.700
...the view from my penthouse

09:47.766 --> 09:49.466
is lonely

09:49.533 --> 09:52.133
without someone
to share it with.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.400
Without that special someone..

09:59.933 --> 10:01.933
'...who will love me
for what I am.'

10:02.000 --> 10:03.233
Perfect.

10:04.733 --> 10:06.466
I can't believe
I said all that stuff.

10:06.533 --> 10:09.433
What's important is that
special someone believes it.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.100
She's out there, waiting.

10:11.166 --> 10:13.666
Waiting for a man, just like
the man that's on that video.

10:13.733 --> 10:16.133
Waiting for you.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.100
And with the help
of Rendezvous patented

10:18.166 --> 10:20.800
date-make computer technology

10:20.866 --> 10:22.833
we're gonna find
the girl of your dreams.

10:46.233 --> 10:47.700
Hey, Gordy.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.733
Well, you sure
weren't shy last night.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.000
I don't usually play
those kinds of games.

10:58.066 --> 11:00.466
But I've always wanted to.

11:00.533 --> 11:03.900
I've never been
the aggressive type.

11:05.333 --> 11:06.466
Not till now.

11:09.533 --> 11:11.733
Can't say no to me, Gordy.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.733
You just can't.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.266
Hello?

11:50.333 --> 11:52.066
'Is this Gordy?'

11:52.133 --> 11:54.300
- Yeah.
- 'Uh, hi.'

11:54.366 --> 11:56.200
'My name's Lana.'

11:56.266 --> 11:58.500
'I got your number
from Rendezvous Dating.'

11:58.566 --> 12:00.633
'Mr. Bangor said
he'd given you mine, but..'

12:00.700 --> 12:03.066
'...then,
when you didn't call, well..'

12:03.133 --> 12:06.666
'...I figured I'd have to be
the one to make the first move.'

12:06.733 --> 12:08.766
'I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.'

12:08.833 --> 12:09.800
'I've always wanted to'

12:09.866 --> 12:11.433
'but I've never been'

12:11.500 --> 12:13.133
'the aggressive type.'

12:13.200 --> 12:15.133
'Not till now, anyway.'

12:16.633 --> 12:19.033
Oh, huh, uh, yeah,
Lana. Oh, yeah, I remember.

12:19.100 --> 12:22.300
I do and, uh, um, uh..

12:22.366 --> 12:26.033
'Well...would you like
to go out sometime?'

12:27.766 --> 12:31.266
'Come on, you can't say no,
you just can't.'

12:31.333 --> 12:34.633
Well, no.
I mean, uh, yes. I mean, um..

12:37.600 --> 12:41.033
- How's Saturday night?
- 'Great.'

12:41.100 --> 12:44.533
'I'm really looking forward
to meeting you, Gordy.'

12:44.600 --> 12:46.733
'I hope you're
not disappointed.'

13:22.266 --> 13:25.500
Hi...I'm Gordon.

13:25.566 --> 13:27.300
Gordy.

13:27.366 --> 13:28.666
'Mary, if that's Gordon'

13:28.733 --> 13:30.333
'tell him I'll be right there.'

13:31.733 --> 13:33.333
Thank you.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.266
So, you're Mary.

13:36.333 --> 13:39.033
Had you worried there
for a minute.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.933
Worried, no, no.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.233
You're not as good a liar
as Lana's other dates.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.833
But you're shorter.

13:48.900 --> 13:51.266
Hi!

13:51.333 --> 13:52.800
Hi.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.366
Well, am I what you expected?

13:56.500 --> 13:58.933
You're exactly
what I expected.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.733
- Then you're not disappointed.
- Not any more.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.133
It was nice to meet you, Mary.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.633
'You too, Gordy.'

14:20.800 --> 14:24.200
Uh, so, umm, I sent..

14:24.266 --> 14:26.166
...the Ferrari to the shop..

14:26.233 --> 14:27.266
...to be painted.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.900
- What color?
- And...the Ferrari?

14:31.333 --> 14:33.866
- Red.
- Oh, I love red.

14:33.933 --> 14:35.933
- You do?
- Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.600
Great, um, well, then of course
it goes out from under me

14:38.666 --> 14:40.400
you know,
the damn carburetor and..

14:40.466 --> 14:41.500
And it's new?

14:41.566 --> 14:43.433
Brand, right off
the showroom floor

14:43.500 --> 14:47.333
so they stuck me
with this lousy loaner.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.333
You know, Gordy, I maybe blonde,
but I'm not dumb.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.500
'They stopped
putting carburetors'

14:51.566 --> 14:53.733
'in the European models
in 1973'

14:53.800 --> 14:56.533
and in the American models
since '71.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.033
Besides I can really
see you driving around

14:59.100 --> 15:01.100
in a beat-up old loaner.

15:10.933 --> 15:12.633
Not a guy like you, Gordy.

15:23.866 --> 15:26.633
'This restaurant is supposed
to be the best.'

15:26.700 --> 15:29.966
'Everyone says the food
is absolutely fabulous.'

15:30.033 --> 15:32.733
'The owners brought the chef
all the way over from Europe.'

15:32.800 --> 15:34.300
Romania, I think.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.700
Yeah, great glasses.

15:39.333 --> 15:42.066
Oh, this is beautiful, Gordy.

15:42.133 --> 15:44.133
So romantic.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.433
I hear the food here
is wonderful.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.433
Oh, I've never
been here before.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.833
Oh, I like a man who's
not afraid to try something new.

15:54.433 --> 15:55.400
Oh.

16:02.266 --> 16:04.800
Gordy, could we have
some champagne?

16:04.866 --> 16:07.233
Umm, huh?

16:07.300 --> 16:08.966
- Oh, champagne?
- Uh-huh.

16:09.033 --> 16:09.966
Yeah, oh..

16:10.033 --> 16:11.400
Mademoiselle..

16:29.400 --> 16:30.500
Ooh, la, la.

16:30.566 --> 16:33.100
I didn't know
you spoke French.

16:33.166 --> 16:36.033
- French?
- Uh-huh.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.966
Well, you just sort of pic
that kind of thing up..

16:39.033 --> 16:42.066
...when...you play hockey
for Montreal.

16:42.133 --> 16:44.933
I had to do all of my
Stanley Cup interviews

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
in English
and

16:47.066 --> 16:49.266
'Oh, you know, it amazes me
how guys like you'

16:49.333 --> 16:51.300
'always know just
the right thing to say.'

16:52.700 --> 16:54.133
Yeah, well,
you sort of get used to that

16:54.200 --> 16:55.766
when you...when you make

16:55.833 --> 16:58.400
umm, uh, small talk.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.033
Although, franc
and the pound are obsolete

17:02.100 --> 17:03.366
in a world run by
the dollar and the yen.

17:08.300 --> 17:11.333
- Oh, no, this is silk.
- Silk..

17:19.600 --> 17:22.033
Gordy, what are you
staring at?

17:22.100 --> 17:24.200
Sorry.

17:24.266 --> 17:27.266
Well, with a neckline like that,
it's hard not to see.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.800
Oh, no, no, no,
when she opened the bottle

17:28.866 --> 17:31.266
the, the cork,
it-it-it, it..

17:31.333 --> 17:32.766
and then it got
all over your dress

17:32.833 --> 17:36.633
and, and, and,
if-if that stains..

17:36.700 --> 17:38.766
...you can send me
the dry-cleaning bill.

17:38.833 --> 17:41.600
You are so thoughtful.

17:42.933 --> 17:46.766
Our first date.

17:46.833 --> 17:50.433
I hope that I can make
all your dreams come true.

18:01.233 --> 18:03.433
Uh..

18:03.500 --> 18:05.100
You know, Gordy,
that Rendezvous computer

18:05.166 --> 18:08.033
may turn out to be
a...pretty good matchmaker.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.433
You know, I just, I-I don't
understand what a pretty girl

18:10.500 --> 18:13.266
like you is doing
at a computer dating service.

18:13.333 --> 18:14.933
Pretty girls get lonely too.

18:16.833 --> 18:19.033
I spent lots of Saturday
nights at home.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.800
Well, it's just lucky
I'm not the jealous type.

18:34.133 --> 18:36.166
Becauseyouare the ki

18:36.233 --> 18:37.866
a girl would kill for.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.166
Oh, my God!

18:44.233 --> 18:45.533
'Ow!'

18:46.200 --> 18:48.300
'Oh!'

18:50.533 --> 18:52.466
Gordy? Are you alright?

19:03.500 --> 19:04.633
Uh..

19:06.700 --> 19:09.166
I-I, uh, I guess I just..

19:09.233 --> 19:11.800
...had a little
too much champagne.

19:12.666 --> 19:14.066
Well, you know what they say.

19:14.133 --> 19:16.433
The more expensive the champagne

19:16.500 --> 19:18.133
the pinker the elephants.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.566
Right.

19:21.633 --> 19:22.866
You know, Gordy

19:22.933 --> 19:25.033
you've made me feel so special.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.533
The way you thought of no one,
but me all night.

19:28.933 --> 19:31.100
Hah.

19:31.166 --> 19:33.633
I think it's only fair
that, after dinner

19:33.700 --> 19:35.633
we do something you like.

19:38.633 --> 19:41.433
Something I know you do
better than anyone else.

19:43.466 --> 19:44.900
Hmm.

20:04.633 --> 20:06.733
How did you get us
in here after hours?

20:06.800 --> 20:08.533
I have my ways.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.600
Ahh.

20:10.666 --> 20:12.000
Isn't it great?

20:12.066 --> 20:14.166
So cool and refreshing.

20:14.233 --> 20:15.733
Freezing's more like it.

20:16.866 --> 20:18.600
Lana, it's late.

20:19.666 --> 20:20.833
Come on, Gordy.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.600
Don't you wanna go to a movie?

20:26.366 --> 20:28.833
I can go to a movie
with any guy, Gordy.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.500
But you're not any guy.

20:31.133 --> 20:32.600
You're special.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.366
Well, you know, um..

20:38.433 --> 20:41.300
I might be a little rusty
from sitting on a desk.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.933
I wouldn't bet
your Stanley Cup on it.

21:29.566 --> 21:31.566
You know, Gordy,
I was beginning to think

21:31.633 --> 21:33.700
you didn't like me.

21:33.766 --> 21:35.966
Oh, I like you just fine.

21:36.033 --> 21:39.133
Right now, I'd trade every
Stanley Cup I ever won for you.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.033
Sure, till you've had
your fun with me.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.700
Used me.

21:43.766 --> 21:45.466
I know what guys like you
are like, Gordy.

21:45.533 --> 21:47.933
Always going after
the next girl, the next trophy.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.766
Believe me, Lana.

21:49.833 --> 21:50.933
I'm not like that.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.400
Not now, Gordy.

21:52.466 --> 21:54.000
Why not?

21:56.866 --> 22:00.033
Because, it'sgame time!

22:00.100 --> 22:01.166
Come on, Gordy.

22:01.233 --> 22:03.933
Show me those famous
flashing blades.

22:05.533 --> 22:08.733
I'm-I-m really not very good,
I mean, I-I've got weak ankles!

22:08.800 --> 22:12.733
Let's go, Gordy. You're a pro.
A world champion.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.866
Well, you know, not-not really.

22:17.933 --> 22:21.000
I, uh, maybe I exaggerated
the truth, you know just

22:21.066 --> 22:22.600
'a little bit.'

22:25.033 --> 22:26.300
I've never won a Stanley Cup

22:26.366 --> 22:28.400
and I sure as hell
don't speak French.

22:28.466 --> 22:30.833
Oh. Noparlez vous

22:30.900 --> 22:33.266
No! No! And I sell insurance.

22:33.333 --> 22:35.233
Uh, on commission.

22:35.300 --> 22:38.266
I mean, I could never afford
to-to-to flaunt those fancy cars

22:38.333 --> 22:40.666
'and the, and the apartment on
what Springwood Mutual paid me.'

22:40.733 --> 22:43.300
Are you telling me
you lied, Gordy?

22:43.366 --> 22:44.933
Yes! I lied!

22:46.800 --> 22:48.700
No!

22:48.766 --> 22:50.100
But they were just..

22:51.600 --> 22:52.766
...little lies.

22:52.833 --> 22:55.533
I mean, I-I, um..

22:55.600 --> 22:57.533
...I do it all the time,
everybody does.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.633
But it's not like..

22:59.700 --> 23:02.500
It's...it's not like..

23:02.566 --> 23:04.100
...anybody got hurt.

23:13.966 --> 23:16.233
Lana, please!

23:16.866 --> 23:18.333
Lana!

23:19.800 --> 23:21.433
'Lana!'

23:22.700 --> 23:24.800
Lana? Lana?

23:24.866 --> 23:26.600
Please, Lana?

23:27.433 --> 23:29.133
Lana?

23:29.200 --> 23:31.833
'Okay, okay, I lied, but
that's-that's not a crime.'

23:31.900 --> 23:34.233
'Well, okay, maybe it is,
but it's a misdemeanor.'

23:34.300 --> 23:36.233
'It's definitely not a felony
and this is definitely cruel'

23:36.300 --> 23:37.933
'unusual punishment!'

23:39.533 --> 23:41.033
Help, Lan-Lana.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.066
Help!

23:46.133 --> 23:47.200
Lana!

23:51.166 --> 23:53.400
Isn't this a wonderful machine?

23:53.466 --> 23:55.666
It does everything it promises.

23:55.733 --> 23:58.633
It makes the ice
so clean and shiny.

23:59.900 --> 24:02.000
You can almost
see yourself in it.

25:05.566 --> 25:08.366
When it comes to flesh..

25:08.433 --> 25:11.233
...the first cut's
always the deepest.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.800
Voila.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.266
What is going on in here?

26:16.333 --> 26:18.800
All that screaming and beating
on this poor machine.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.000
Well, if you're trying
to get fired

26:24.066 --> 26:25.500
you can just forget it.

26:25.566 --> 26:27.733
Because I'm not gonna get stuck
paying your half of the rent

26:27.800 --> 26:29.933
while you're out tryin'
to find another job.

26:33.100 --> 26:34.533
There.

26:35.966 --> 26:37.133
You're always letting
the stupidest

26:37.200 --> 26:39.400
little things upset you.

26:39.466 --> 26:42.200
Ah! I broke a nail.

26:42.266 --> 26:43.733
Oh! Tsk. Wha..

26:43.800 --> 26:45.300
I thought I heard screaming.

26:45.366 --> 26:47.466
Are you alright?
Should we call for help?

26:47.533 --> 26:48.833
Well, unfortunately
my manicurist

26:48.900 --> 26:50.100
doesn't make house calls.

26:50.166 --> 26:51.366
Oh!

26:51.433 --> 26:53.800
Well, you go get that fixe
right away

26:53.866 --> 26:56.300
and take the afternoon off
if you have to.

26:56.366 --> 26:58.133
We wanna make sure
the hand that greets

26:58.200 --> 27:00.900
our Springwood Properties'
clients is a pretty one.

27:01.866 --> 27:03.800
Whatever you say, Mr. Fadiman.

27:06.700 --> 27:08.400
- Oh, Lana.
- Mm-hm.

27:09.900 --> 27:13.133
Mr. Rawley will be flying in
from the coast Saturday night

27:13.200 --> 27:15.633
to sign the escrow papers
on the Welman estate.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.633
That was Milly Stern's listing.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.366
Mrs. Stern made the deal

27:23.433 --> 27:26.033
'with Rawley's construction
company over the phone.'

27:26.100 --> 27:27.533
He'd never guess by the sound
of her voice

27:27.600 --> 27:29.600
she was a grandmother.

27:29.666 --> 27:31.866
I'd like you to close that deal.

27:31.933 --> 27:34.700
Get Rawley that
special personal attention

27:34.766 --> 27:38.033
that the Springwood Realty
is so famous for.

27:39.233 --> 27:41.200
It would be my pleasure.

27:47.533 --> 27:48.666
'Miss Kelly.'

27:50.666 --> 27:53.133
'Alright, let's set it up
for tomorrow.'

27:53.200 --> 27:54.166
'Where are the copies of my'

27:54.233 --> 27:56.000
Springwood beautification
report?

27:56.066 --> 27:58.900
I need them for tomorrow's
town's council meeting.

27:58.966 --> 28:01.233
I'll have them for you
by the end of the day.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.300
As you can see things have been

28:03.366 --> 28:04.766
pretty busy around here lately.

28:04.833 --> 28:06.033
It's about time

28:06.100 --> 28:08.766
the market went soft
after that Kruger business.

28:08.833 --> 28:10.500
But people are finally
starting to see

28:10.566 --> 28:12.866
that Springwood's
just like any other town.

28:12.933 --> 28:14.500
Only with affordable housing.

28:14.566 --> 28:16.366
'And Rawley building
his shopping center'

28:16.433 --> 28:17.766
'on the Welman estate'

28:17.833 --> 28:20.733
won't hurt the town's new
upwardly mobile image either.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.333
He's gonna tear down
that beautiful old house?

28:24.400 --> 28:26.966
Beauty is in the eye
of the deed holder.

28:27.033 --> 28:28.900
'Anyway it was condemned
weeks ago.'

28:28.966 --> 28:32.200
'Rawley just saved us the price
and the trouble of a bulldozer.'

28:32.266 --> 28:35.533
I wish we could get rid of all
this town's eyesores so easily.

28:52.966 --> 28:55.066
Copier copier in the hall.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.700
Who's the fairest
of them all?

28:57.766 --> 28:59.866
Ain't me.

29:36.333 --> 29:38.033
What do you think?

29:45.166 --> 29:47.100
'It's not too tight, is it?'

29:49.700 --> 29:51.733
I feel like an elephant
after eating that big dinner

29:51.800 --> 29:53.666
atLe

29:53.733 --> 29:56.400
Is it as nice as everyone says?

29:56.466 --> 29:57.900
The food is good.

29:57.966 --> 29:59.933
The service is kinda spotty.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.766
I was gonna buy it in red but..

30:03.833 --> 30:06.100
...I figured black would be more
appropriate for the office.

30:06.166 --> 30:08.400
You bought that for the office?

30:08.466 --> 30:10.566
Well, my meeting with Rawley
is on company time.

30:10.633 --> 30:12.666
Anyway Fadiman paid for it.

30:12.733 --> 30:15.133
You should've told him
to stick it.

30:15.200 --> 30:18.200
I thought I'd give Mr. Rawley
first chance at this hot

30:18.266 --> 30:21.500
little property, that's
currently on the market...me!

30:21.566 --> 30:26.133
You think your Mr. Rawley is
in the market for a Mrs. Rawley?

30:26.200 --> 30:27.933
I'm not into job titles

30:28.000 --> 30:29.933
so long as the salary's right.

30:31.966 --> 30:34.600
I know, I know.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.600
A woman should be valued
for who she is

30:36.666 --> 30:39.100
and not what
she looks like, right?

30:39.166 --> 30:40.466
'The way I see it'

30:40.533 --> 30:42.833
life's just
one big beauty pageant.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.766
Like it or not we are all
contestants from the minut

30:44.833 --> 30:47.200
they slap your butt and tell
your daddy, it's a girl.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.466
The only choice we have..

30:50.533 --> 30:52.966
...is weather to be winners..

30:53.033 --> 30:54.466
...or losers.

30:54.533 --> 30:56.533
Not everybody has that choice.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.733
Everybody has a choice.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.800
'You can look like
anybody you want.'

31:02.766 --> 31:04.400
Pick a face, any face.

31:04.466 --> 31:06.666
And a whole new body.

31:06.733 --> 31:09.800
I know a guy who can mix
and match 'em however you want.

31:09.866 --> 31:13.200
His name wouldn't happen to be
Dr. Frankenstein, would it?

31:14.666 --> 31:17.533
Very funny!
No, his name is Tony.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.300
'The guy's a miracle worker.'

31:20.700 --> 31:23.000
To make me beautiful,
he'd have to be.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.533
It's too late to make
a big decision tonight.

31:30.133 --> 31:32.266
So you just think about it and..

31:32.333 --> 31:34.133
...let me know in the morning.

31:50.400 --> 31:51.700
Lana..

31:53.000 --> 31:55.200
...I'm not
so sure about this.

31:55.266 --> 31:56.833
Hmm.

31:56.900 --> 31:59.133
What price beauty?

31:59.200 --> 32:01.166
Just put it
on your credit card.

32:01.233 --> 32:03.200
It's not just the money.

32:04.333 --> 32:06.166
What if it doesn't
turn out right?

32:06.233 --> 32:08.733
Mary, let's be honest.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.833
What have you got to lose?

32:10.900 --> 32:12.866
You'll love Tony.
He's the best.

32:12.933 --> 32:15.366
The absolute best.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.000
Relax.

32:17.066 --> 32:19.100
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.466
I told you, didn't I?

32:25.533 --> 32:27.033
You're beautiful.

32:27.100 --> 32:29.566
Now give it a toss.

32:29.633 --> 32:31.966
Yeah, that's it.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.300
See how the hair
brings out the eyes

32:34.366 --> 32:37.366
'and frames those
exquisite cheek bones'

32:37.433 --> 32:39.233
and that cute little nose.

32:40.766 --> 32:43.333
Oh, this is what
it's all about for me.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.300
Making women happy.

32:55.633 --> 32:58.433
So...you must be Mary.

33:00.833 --> 33:02.600
She's a little nervous.

33:04.100 --> 33:06.533
Well, you're standing right
next to some of my best work.

33:08.266 --> 33:10.733
So, Mary, are you ready?

33:12.033 --> 33:13.300
Go on.

33:26.666 --> 33:28.600
Okay, Mary,
what'll it be?

33:30.700 --> 33:33.233
Make me pretty.

33:33.300 --> 33:35.600
Well, pretty is,
as pretty does.

33:37.866 --> 33:39.766
Make me beautiful.

33:39.833 --> 33:41.266
Babe..

33:41.333 --> 33:43.333
...beauty's only skin deep

33:43.400 --> 33:46.166
The stuff that really counts,
that's inside.

33:46.233 --> 33:47.233
Yeah, well, I'd kinda like to

33:47.300 --> 33:49.433
try it on the outside
for a while.

33:49.500 --> 33:50.900
Okay.

33:50.966 --> 33:53.100
You're the one who's gotta shave
in the morning.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.433
To me..

33:56.500 --> 33:59.066
...you're perfect.

33:59.133 --> 34:01.466
But if you wanna be different..

34:01.533 --> 34:03.033
...I'll make you different

34:04.200 --> 34:06.133
I know exactly what I want

34:07.300 --> 34:08.433
Baby..

34:08.500 --> 34:10.000
...you and the rest
of the female race

34:10.066 --> 34:12.533
haven't the slightest
idea what you want.

34:14.533 --> 34:17.833
I can remember when
all the women wanted in life

34:17.900 --> 34:20.466
was to be somebody's wife.

34:20.533 --> 34:24.166
Mrs. Anybody
was better than being Miss..

34:24.233 --> 34:26.466
Unless it was Miss America.

34:26.533 --> 34:29.966
Now, she doesn't want to be
Miss America at all.

34:30.033 --> 34:31.633
She wants to be President.

34:31.700 --> 34:33.133
Or better yet..

34:33.200 --> 34:35.033
...the President's wife.

34:35.100 --> 34:36.700
All the power..

34:36.766 --> 34:39.466
...and none
of the responsibilities.

34:39.533 --> 34:42.966
You just wanted
to be taken care of.

34:43.033 --> 34:44.900
Then you wanted your space.

34:44.966 --> 34:46.466
And not too much space.

34:46.533 --> 34:48.200
Because what you really wanted..

34:48.266 --> 34:50.166
...was intimacy.

35:00.100 --> 35:02.533
'You told us, you wanted a man'

35:02.600 --> 35:05.200
who would let you be free.

35:07.333 --> 35:09.933
But not unless, he was willing
to make a commitment.

35:12.866 --> 35:15.733
'Now, I like pretty girls.'

35:15.800 --> 35:16.866
'But it's like..'

35:16.933 --> 35:18.866
'...looking at the Mona Lisa.'

35:18.933 --> 35:22.833
'Oh, sure,
it's a great painting, but uh..'

35:22.900 --> 35:24.833
'...I don't wanna
take her home.'

35:26.633 --> 35:28.066
'Ah!'

35:28.133 --> 35:29.300
I like, uh..

35:29.366 --> 35:30.700
...smart women.

35:30.766 --> 35:32.133
A woman who'd know
how to listen.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.100
And uh..

35:35.166 --> 35:36.300
...funny women.

35:36.366 --> 35:38.333
Women who make me laugh.

35:39.533 --> 35:42.133
'Now, the new
woman is different.'

35:42.200 --> 35:45.133
'She's not about to change her
name when she gets married.'

35:46.400 --> 35:48.900
'Yet, she doesn't think twice'

35:48.966 --> 35:51.600
'about changing
her face and body.'

35:51.666 --> 35:53.700
- Ow!
- 'Anything and everything.'

35:54.800 --> 35:56.800
- 'And all of it for love.'
- Ah!

36:03.733 --> 36:06.133
God, I love women.

36:15.766 --> 36:17.800
Oh, Mary,
you're beautiful.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.300
Really beautiful!

36:21.366 --> 36:22.966
And you!

36:23.033 --> 36:24.400
You're a genius!

36:24.466 --> 36:26.433
Well, I'm just here
to make you happy.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.866
This is what my life is about.

36:29.933 --> 36:32.066
I just can't help it.

36:32.133 --> 36:33.433
I love women.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.933
Thanks.

36:41.633 --> 36:44.500
She didn't even
leave a tip.

36:44.566 --> 36:47.133
I still can't believe
it's really me.

36:47.200 --> 36:50.066
It's just the way
I dreamed it.

36:50.133 --> 36:51.533
Now, that you're different
everything's going

36:51.600 --> 36:52.966
to be different.

36:53.033 --> 36:55.133
It's just the way
I dreamed it.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.333
Now..

36:57.400 --> 37:00.500
...I have one more
little surprise for you.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.200
You have a date
tomorrow night

37:02.266 --> 37:03.933
with Mr. Rawley.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.333
What?

37:05.400 --> 37:07.533
Well, what else can you
give a girl who has everything

37:07.600 --> 37:08.933
except a man.

37:10.233 --> 37:12.033
Fadiman will kill us.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.866
We'll both get fired.

37:13.933 --> 37:16.933
All he cares about is keeping
the customers satisfied.

37:18.900 --> 37:22.333
And I think Mr. Rawley
will be very satisfied.

37:24.133 --> 37:25.866
Do you really think so?

37:25.933 --> 37:28.200
Of course he will.

37:28.266 --> 37:30.700
When everyone was all upset
about the ol' Welman estate

37:30.766 --> 37:33.933
being torn down because
it was special and unique.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.833
Mr. Rawley was the one
with the vision to see

37:35.900 --> 37:38.766
that these things
just weren't important.

37:38.833 --> 37:41.466
As part of the Springwood
beautification project.

37:41.533 --> 37:43.600
It had to go.

37:43.666 --> 37:45.200
Buildings, people.

37:45.833 --> 37:47.833
Pretty is pretty.

37:47.900 --> 37:50.000
And you're beautiful.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.900
Lana, I don't know
how to thank you.

37:56.966 --> 38:00.266
Don't thank me.
You did it.

38:00.333 --> 38:01.866
'You knew what you wanted.'

38:01.933 --> 38:04.166
You wanted to be perfect.

38:04.233 --> 38:06.100
And now you are.

38:06.166 --> 38:07.600
'So enjoy yourself.'

38:09.033 --> 38:10.900
You deserve it.

38:10.966 --> 38:14.000
You know, I used to think
that you just kept me around

38:14.066 --> 38:17.533
so you'd look even more
beautiful by comparison.

38:18.333 --> 38:20.400
But I was wrong.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.900
Lana, Lana!

39:33.966 --> 39:37.433
Aren't you gonna introduce me
to your friend?

39:37.500 --> 39:40.933
It's me,
Mr. Fadiman. Mary.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.933
Of course. Mary.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.433
I told her
no one would recognize her.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.733
It's amazing
what a new hairdo and, uh..

39:49.800 --> 39:51.566
...a little makeup will do.

39:51.633 --> 39:52.966
Amazing.

39:53.033 --> 39:54.333
Oh, well,
I better get back to work.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.933
Wait, wait, Mary. Wait.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.600
But don't you need those copies
of your beautification reports.

39:58.666 --> 40:00.233
I think it's time

40:00.300 --> 40:03.166
you started working out here
on the floor.

40:03.233 --> 40:05.400
We could even get you
your own desk.

40:05.466 --> 40:07.766
Yes, right here by the window.

40:07.833 --> 40:11.600
AndI
your first clients for you

40:11.666 --> 40:13.966
Mary, this is
Mr. and Mrs. Winters

40:14.033 --> 40:16.300
and their
two adorable children.

40:16.366 --> 40:18.266
I know Mary will be able
to find you

40:18.333 --> 40:20.533
the house of your dreams.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.200
I'm sure you'll be
every bit as happy

40:22.266 --> 40:24.066
in Springwood as I have been.

40:26.033 --> 40:29.433
Mr. Rawley's plane was due
in over an hour ago.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.600
He'll be here.

40:31.666 --> 40:33.966
Are you sure this is alright
with Fadiman?

40:34.033 --> 40:36.833
Mary, there's no sense
in being beautiful

40:36.900 --> 40:40.066
if you're not gonna
start acting like it.

40:40.133 --> 40:42.366
Hello!

40:42.433 --> 40:43.900
Hello, Mr. Rawley.

40:43.966 --> 40:46.166
I'm Lana.
This is my associate Mary.

40:46.233 --> 40:47.833
She's gonna help you
with the paperwork.

40:47.900 --> 40:50.433
'So you can close the escrow
on the Welman property.'

40:50.500 --> 40:53.200
But Mr. Fadiman told me
I would be dealing with you.

40:54.766 --> 40:58.766
But I think this arrangement
is going to work out just fine.

40:58.833 --> 41:00.466
All we want
here at Springwood Properties

41:00.533 --> 41:03.600
is to make sure the clients
leaves completely satisfied.

41:04.766 --> 41:06.133
Mary, would you mind terribly

41:06.200 --> 41:07.400
if we went over
some of this paperwork

41:07.466 --> 41:09.066
back at my hotel room?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.600
Hm. Alright.

41:31.266 --> 41:33.400
'Aren't you hungry?'

41:33.466 --> 41:35.733
'I thought I was.'

41:35.800 --> 41:37.666
I was gonna have him send up
a couple of steaks

41:37.733 --> 41:40.566
but you said
you loved caviar.

41:40.633 --> 41:42.366
I do.

41:42.433 --> 41:44.566
It just didn't taste
very good to me tonight.

41:44.633 --> 41:47.400
That stuff never taste
any good.

41:47.466 --> 41:49.833
But then I really
didn't have much of an appetite.

41:52.166 --> 41:53.666
You're probably bored
with men telling you

41:53.733 --> 41:55.733
how beautiful you are.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.300
I don't know how anybody
could ever get tired

41:57.366 --> 41:59.333
of hearing
a thing like that.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.933
Is that a no?

42:05.700 --> 42:08.266
You just surprised me.

42:08.333 --> 42:09.566
Well, then..

42:09.633 --> 42:11.700
Shall we get down to business?

42:22.933 --> 42:24.433
Come on, relax.

42:27.633 --> 42:30.100
You can't tell me
that doesn't feel good.

42:30.166 --> 42:31.733
What?

42:31.800 --> 42:33.166
That.

42:40.300 --> 42:42.666
- Am I hurting you?
- No.

42:42.733 --> 42:45.233
I just don't feel anything

42:45.300 --> 42:48.200
Oh. Maybe
I'm not hurting you enough.

42:53.200 --> 42:54.500
What are those?

42:59.333 --> 43:01.100
I have seen
some bad boob jobs

43:01.166 --> 43:02.800
but those are the worst.

43:02.866 --> 43:04.866
You really ought to
get your money back.

43:04.933 --> 43:07.700
No offence,
but they just don't look real.

43:09.433 --> 43:11.766
In fact you should sue,
that's malpractice.

43:11.833 --> 43:13.466
'You should be compensated.'

43:13.533 --> 43:16.000
'I'll put you in touch
with my attorney if you like.'

43:16.733 --> 43:19.433
No! No!

43:20.533 --> 43:22.266
Come on, calm down.

43:22.333 --> 43:24.100
Take it easy, honey.
They can fix it.

43:24.166 --> 43:26.100
They can fix anything.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.233
'Take it easy.
What are you doing with that?'

43:29.300 --> 43:33.100
'Don't be crazy!
Stop that, for God's sake!'

43:33.166 --> 43:34.533
'I'm sorry.'

43:41.600 --> 43:43.766
I told you,
once you were different

43:43.833 --> 43:45.966
everything would be different.

43:46.033 --> 43:48.300
But you wanted to be perfect.

43:48.366 --> 43:50.566
And now you are..

43:50.633 --> 43:52.633
...so enjoy yourself.

43:54.433 --> 43:56.000
You deserve it.

44:11.066 --> 44:13.300
I swear to you,
I didn't do it.

44:13.366 --> 44:15.700
Call Fadiman at
Springwood Properties again.

44:15.766 --> 44:17.933
If he's not there,
call her friend Lana.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.366
God, I don't even know
her last name.

44:23.933 --> 44:26.366
'A piece of mirror sliced right
through her jugular.'

44:26.433 --> 44:28.633
'Yeah, not much
of a looker, huh?'

44:28.700 --> 44:30.433
'You ever seen
a good-lookin' corpse?'

44:30.500 --> 44:32.533
'Uh, yeah.'

44:44.133 --> 44:49.033
Remember, beauty's
only skin-deep.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.333
'All that really counts..'

45:00.233 --> 45:02.300
...is what's inside.
