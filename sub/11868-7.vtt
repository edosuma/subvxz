What Sheriff Subtle
is trying to tell you
is that I'm pregnant.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.958
l have a new puzzle
for you to solve.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.589

is massive. Pre-war.

Eureka was built.

(GIRLS SCREAMING)

00:19.895 --> 00:22.978
CARTER: Mrs. Thorne,
ever since you
got to this town,

00:23.106 --> 00:25.017
you've been
looking for something.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.106
Tell me what's going on.

00:27.486 --> 00:28.521
THORNE: No.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.193
CARTER: l have to what?

00:34.326 --> 00:37.659
Oversee the mayoral election.
This is the official
polling place.

00:37.788 --> 00:38.868
It's not a big deal, Carter.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.783
Well, then,
why can't Jo do it?

00:40.916 --> 00:42.326
Because Jo's not your lackey.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.824
Well, the town charter says

00:43.961 --> 00:47.670
that voting security falls
on the highest ranking
law enforcement officer.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.209
That would be you.
Unless you promote me

00:50.342 --> 00:51.878
or become
othen/vise incapacitated.

00:52.010 --> 00:55.844
The mayor's seat has been
open for over a year.
The town needs a voice.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.463
This is a very important
service card.

00:57.599 --> 00:58.884
Well, how important
can it be?

00:59.017 --> 01:02.430
I mean, my daughter's backing
her 17-year-old boyfriend
for the job.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.848
Eureka doesn't discriminate.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.687
Some of our smartest
citizens are teens.

01:05.816 --> 01:08.353
So instead of working,
I have to sit here
and count ballots

01:08.485 --> 01:10.601
for some Doogie mayor?

01:10.737 --> 01:13.820
No, actually, your sister
volunteered for that job.

01:13.949 --> 01:16.941
It's a bad idea.
Lex becomes really
obsessed with politics.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.988
And her mood swings
are already out of hand.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.577
Actually,
she's really into it.

01:20.706 --> 01:23.869
And you know what, you should
be a little more sensitive.
Your sister's pregnant.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.494
What? Paper ballots?

01:30.007 --> 01:33.215
Digital voting machines are
way too easy to tamper with.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.961
And campaigns
get really competitive
around here.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.882
Okay. I'll do it.

you talk me into this.

We're the glue that holds
this town together, Vincent.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.578
It's time we had a voice.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.323

03:03.975 --> 03:07.012
(STUTTERING) Well,
Mr. Herrera, is it?

03:07.187 --> 03:08.893
I would love to
endorse somebody, but...

03:09.022 --> 03:10.808
But he's already
promised his endorsement...

03:10.941 --> 03:12.932
To my candidate,
right, Sheriff?
Well, actually...

03:13.068 --> 03:15.935
Eureka needs
a mayor who understands
how a company town works.

03:16.071 --> 03:19.438
Why? So your boss can have
some Global Dynamics puppet
to sell out the town?

is Thorne gonna fire?

Took you brainiacs all
night to come up with that?

08:48.528 --> 08:52.441
ALLISON: No. It took us all
night to rule out any G.D.
experiments as the cause.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.530
So, now we
have two suns?

08:54.826 --> 08:56.282
Just like Tatooine.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.197
Tatu-what?
Geek speak.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.865
The good news
is it's stable,

08:59.998 --> 09:01.909
holding its position
at about 1,000 feet.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.327
So we're not lighting
up the entire state.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.668
Yeah, the last thing we need
is a spotlight on the town
the whole world can see.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.959
Well, agreed.
But it's 6:00 am.
and 90 degrees.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.381
I'm not sure yet.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.967
It has to be some
kind of fusion reaction.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.085
Sounds dangerous.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.803
No, not necessarily.

09:17.932 --> 09:18.842
Based on its containment,

09:18.975 --> 09:20.010
I'd say
it's deliberate.

a second sun on purpose?

trying to make a big bang
at the debates.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.978

to endorse him.

around the facility.
What's down there anyway?

09:37.077 --> 09:40.035
Well, nothing for long.
She ordered
a thermal cleaning.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.028

come from inside?

about that endorsement?

sooner than later.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.554
Welcome to my cloud farm.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.770
Cloud farm?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.942
Yeah, that's
what he said.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.279
I've taken cloud seeding
to a whole new level
with nanotech hydration.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.616
Cumulus, stratus, cirrus,
I can create 'em all.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.114
Oh, like you did
with the, with the
cloud gag yesterday?

11:04.247 --> 11:06.579
Nice, huh?
I found a way
to hydrogenically

11:06.708 --> 11:09.199
infuse the atmosphere
so I can literally
sculpt clouds.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.166
The commercial
applications are limitless.

11:11.296 --> 11:14.834
Wow. Well,
I'm more concerned
about your sun stunt.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.332
Sun? No, no, no.
I'm strictly a cloud guy.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.208
Not that I don't mind
the bump in the
polling numbers.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.721
People love a spectacle.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.963
Yeah, but you have
to admit the timing
was suspicious.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.215
Have anyone from Global
come and review my record.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.012
My life is
an open book, Sheriff.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.511
l'm beholden to
my constituents.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.983
CARTER: Gotta admit,
it's a hell of a show.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.739
Zane! Just the man
I'm looking for.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.909
Save your breath, Fargo.
I already know
who I'm voting for.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.749
l'm offended.
You think I'm only
here to get your vote?

11:51.878 --> 11:53.414
You're not?
No.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.955
I also want a favor.
It is roasting out there.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.797
A candidate has to
project cool confidence

11:58.927 --> 12:00.883
under the most
extreme conditions.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.798
I hear through the grapevine
you're beta-testing something

12:02.931 --> 12:05.263
that can help
with staying cool.

12:05.642 --> 12:06.631
Yeah, I might be.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.929
Give me enough
to get through
the election and if...

12:09.062 --> 12:10.677
When Vincent wins,

12:10.813 --> 12:12.678
l'll name a park
bench after you.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.975
Tempting, but no.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.690
I don't do politics.
But good luck with that.

12:17.278 --> 12:20.987
Based on these sun scans,
I'd say your competition's
definitely heating up.

12:28.998 --> 12:33.037
(SlGHlNG) l was testing
the voting machines
and I got dizzy.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.827
I know you're not an O.B.

12:35.964 --> 12:39.707
Not really a fan
of Western medicine.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.378
But, I trust you.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.088
Well, I'm flattered.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.928
I'm sure you have much
bigger issues to deal with.

12:46.057 --> 12:50.551
Yes, and l have people
to deal with them. So,
put your mind at ease.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.230
So Carter says you've always
been interested in politics.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.519
He said I'm obsessed,
didn't he?

12:57.652 --> 12:59.062
(BOTH LAUGHING)
No.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.651
Jack thinks
the system is broken.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.988
But I think it's up to us
to make the system work.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.357
(MACHINE BEEPING)

13:06.035 --> 13:08.947
Well, this little guy's
system is working perfectly.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.162
Here. Want to take a look?

13:15.753 --> 13:17.914
(LAUGHS) It's amazing.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.251
What? Is something wrong?

13:25.388 --> 13:28.926
I think I figured
out why your hormones
are so out of whack.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.673
You're getting
a double dose.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.301
Lexi, you're having twins.
Both boys.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.806
Two sons?

13:38.735 --> 13:39.690
(LAUGHS)

13:39.819 --> 13:41.855
Two suns.
Why didn't I think
of that?

13:41.988 --> 13:43.103
Because it's crazy.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.946
It's brilliant. Lucas,
I don't think you appreciate
what's at stake here.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.111
I mean, the mayor's
office oversees city hall.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.199
So?

13:49.329 --> 13:51.160
So, that includes
the sheriff's department.

13:51.289 --> 13:52.825
I mean, you could be
my dad's boss.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.334
(LAUGHS WEAKLY)
And I thought
he hated me now.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.701
(SIGHS) It's time to
step up our game.

13:59.130 --> 14:02.293
When the world hands
you suns, make sunscreen.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.211
lced mocha, folks.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.678
Stays cool as Vincent
will be, when he takes
the oath of office.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.762

100 degrees out here.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.804
Some candidates
can handle the heat
better than others.

14:13.936 --> 14:14.925
Nice gimmick.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.896
We're just helping
the voters stay refreshed
so they can make

14:18.024 --> 14:19.309
a cogent decision
at the polling booth.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.898
Yeah, and we're just
trying to protect voters

14:21.027 --> 14:24.144
from harmful UV rays
so they won't be blinded
by indecision.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.946
lced mocha!
Get it while it's cold.

14:27.075 --> 14:30.238
Sunscreen, people.
Vote Lucas and say
no to premature aging.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.828
Zoe, I've had a small
issue with our class project.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.865
Bigger priorities
at the moment, Kylie.
Here, grab a box.

14:37.001 --> 14:40.414
No. I think this is
something you're really
gonna want to see.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.045
This better be good.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.500
(SlGHlNG)

14:48.888 --> 14:51.254
Okay, Fargo,
what's the big emergency?

14:51.391 --> 14:54.929
(CLEARING THROAT)
The corruption of
the democratic process.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.892
Everyone knows
Herrera's in Thorne's pocket.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.979
And now
she's harassing my
candidate. Look.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.848
All right, what are
you talking about?

15:01.984 --> 15:04.191
It's my wall of fame.
Thorne took it.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.732
FARGO: She redacted
all the photos
of Eureka's founders.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.070
She just doesn't
want the voters to see

15:08.199 --> 15:10.565
how connected Vincent is
to this town's history.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.828
Why would she do that?
Why?

15:18.167 --> 15:19.418
Herrera checked out.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.910
There's nothing in his
background having to do
with solar energy

15:22.046 --> 15:23.126
or fusion power.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.292
Great. So we got two
suns and no suspects.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.665
(WHIRRING)

15:26.801 --> 15:29.338
And now apparently
no air conditioning.

15:30.388 --> 15:31.628

off Herrera?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.880
Other than a creepy
politician vibe, no.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.472
No, nothing.
What did you find?

15:35.601 --> 15:36.977
Well, I ran some scans.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.343
The sun has all
the properties

15:38.479 --> 15:40.185
of a main
sequence dwarf star.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.305
The big question is
its energy source.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.728
Well, I might be able to
shed some light on that.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.192
I ordered
copies of all records

15:46.320 --> 15:48.652
having to do with
the hidden facility
under Tesla.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.488
Now, of course,
Eva's either
had them redacted

15:51.617 --> 15:55.326
or they don't exist.
But, she forgot one thing.
Accounting.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.784
Oh, somebody messed up
their lunch receipt.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.623
The D.O.D. keeps track of
every penny that they spend.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.336
So, I thought I'd see
where they were
spending in 1939.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.626
Check out the stuff
they were ordering.

16:07.758 --> 16:08.747

get into that room

before Thorne does her,
uh, thermal cleaning thing.

takes real talent.

even that hard.

heat and serve.

helping, don't you think?

off on the plasma density.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.818
Like them.
Oh, my God.
Are those...

21:28.954 --> 21:31.331
ZANE: Bodies?
Carter, hand me the scanner.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.824
These bodies were removed
in the last 24 hours.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.750
We have to find
out who they were

21:36.879 --> 21:37.914
and what they
were doing down here.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.003
And why Thorne was
trying to hide them.

kind of insubordination
from you, Sheriff.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.933
Thank you.
But from you two...

21:57.066 --> 22:00.308
I've always had a bit of
trouble with authority.

22:00.444 --> 22:04.312
As far as I'm concerned,
this just became
an active crime scene.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.439
Oh, this is out of your
jurisdiction, Sheriff.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.531
I'd be happy to have the
DOD. remind you of that.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.868
And I'd be happy
to tell them why.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.111
Are you trying to bluff me?

22:12.248 --> 22:14.864
No, he's not
because he's leaving.
We all are.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.116
No, actually.
We're not.

22:17.253 --> 22:20.962
Carter, we crossed the line.
Let's not make it any worse.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.087
You sure about this?

22:26.220 --> 22:27.426
Sorry.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.422
Okay.

22:33.811 --> 22:34.971

ZANE: I can't believe
Allison backed down.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.157
CARTER: Yeah, me neither.
Now Thorne
has all the evidence.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.622
I wouldn't say
all the evidence.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.373
l yanked the data chip
from the dispersion scanner
before they took my stuff.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.746
We can see images of
everything we scanned.

23:03.883 --> 23:04.963

That's definitely not good.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.346
Really?

23:18.230 --> 23:21.939
Well, based on my initial
data, it should've burned
itself out hours ago.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.442
That doesn't look
like it's burning out.

23:26.447 --> 23:28.938
It looks like
it's getting hotter.

23:31.452 --> 23:35.491
l'm melting.
lt's midnight and
110 in the shade.

getting pretty testy.

It reminds me of
tornado weather.

l have a really bad
feeling about this.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.965
Well, um, just keep
everybody calm
and preferably indoors.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.082
JO: Roger that.

23:49.219 --> 23:53.132
Kylie is gathering
atmospheric data.
I should know something soon.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.219
All right.
Zane's working on it too.

23:57.478 --> 24:00.390
And in the meantime,
Thorne's wiping
out any evidence

24:00.522 --> 24:01.932
that connects her
to these bodies.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.306
Any idea who they were?

24:03.442 --> 24:05.524
I'm getting
conflicting information.

24:05.653 --> 24:06.813
How so?

24:06.946 --> 24:08.186
From the surveillance photos,

24:08.322 --> 24:10.938
their approximate age is
somewhere between 35 and 45

24:11.075 --> 24:12.815
when they entered
the room in 1939.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.032
All right.
With you so far.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.867
The organic
residue that you scanned

24:15.996 --> 24:18.658
establishes that
they also died in 1939.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.741
So they've been buried
there for 70 years?

24:22.878 --> 24:24.493
Yeah, well, here's
the really puzzling thing.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.212
Common sense says they
were around 40 when they died.

24:27.341 --> 24:31.755
But based on these readings,
their biological age
is somewhere around 80.

24:39.895 --> 24:43.888
I want someone posted
outside that facility
at all times.

24:45.526 --> 24:48.563
Nobody comes in until
after the thermal cleaning.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.320
Let's get the bodies
ready for transport.

24:52.449 --> 24:55.065
Transport? To where?

24:58.914 --> 25:02.623
I'm afraid that's classified
information, Allison,
as is everything in this room.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.742
And I'd really appreciate it
if you leave now.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.493
You said that you
considered us
to be friends.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.961
I do too.

25:08.465 --> 25:11.798
So, why don't you just
tell me who those men are?

25:12.469 --> 25:16.883
(LAUGHS) I know what it looks
like from where you stand,
but it's not what you think.

These were good men
who gave their
lives for this town.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.219
And it could've
been prevented.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.641
You make it sound
as if you knew them.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.644
It's time for you to go now.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.309
Why are you doing this?

25:30.446 --> 25:32.027
Because I have to.

something I think you're
really gonna want to see.

Well, please tell me
you didn't make another sun.

25:45.794 --> 25:48.786
No, I've been trying to
figure out how to
extinguish the first one.

25:48.922 --> 25:49.957
You mean the second one.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.172
Semantics?
Really, Sheriff?

25:52.301 --> 25:53.336
Could we just...
What?

25:53.469 --> 25:54.834
Kylie, what did you find?

25:54.970 --> 25:57.131
Well, I've been doing
readings all over town

25:57.264 --> 26:00.597
and the upper air
is saturated with
excess hydrogen.

26:00.726 --> 26:01.806
Is that bad?

26:01.935 --> 26:04.142
Well, not by itself.
But mixed with
Kylie's project,

26:04.271 --> 26:06.853
hydrogen could cause
a whopping fusion reaction.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.483
Well, how whopping
are we talking?

26:08.609 --> 26:10.770
Well, depending on the source
and how much is left, big.

26:10.903 --> 26:15.772
Look, I don't know where
this hydrogen is coming from,
but I promise I didn't do it.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.864
That's okay.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.359
l have a pretty
good idea who did.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.737
There's no way my
clouds caused this.

26:22.873 --> 26:25.865
Well, it's not
the clouds themselves.
It's what's inside of them.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.502
It's a whole lot
of hydrogen, right?

26:27.628 --> 26:31.667
Well, not that much. Maybe
1,000 liters at standard
temperature and pressure.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.881
Well, you've been outside.
lt's plenty.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.624
How was I supposed to
know someone'd be creating

26:35.761 --> 26:37.717
a stellar fusion
reaction in
their club house?

26:37.846 --> 26:40.007
Hello. You live
in Eureka.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.886
I guess this means I won't
be getting your endorsement.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.884
Well, let's just
stick to the problem.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.137
Is this how you deliver
the nanos to make your clouds?

26:48.273 --> 26:52.061
Yep. A single stage booster
that fuels the cold accelerant
mixer for better saturation

26:52.194 --> 26:53.900
and heat dispersion.
Nice.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.236
We gotta fix this.
Can you reverse it?

26:56.365 --> 27:00.699
You mean exsanguinate
the excess hydrogen from
Eureka's lower atmosphere?

27:02.538 --> 27:04.779
I mean, I can make
any shape you want,

27:04.915 --> 27:08.578
but once the clouds
have seeded, natural
hydration processes take over.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.122
I say we enjoy the extra
sunlight while we can.

You were saying?

27:30.941 --> 27:32.977
ZANE: lt should've
extinguished itself,
but it didn't.

27:33.110 --> 27:37.149
That's because Kylie's sun,
ingenious though it is,
has evolved from a dwarf star

27:37.281 --> 27:39.067
and is developing
into a red super giant.

27:39.199 --> 27:42.783
Uh, which means?
Instead of burning out,
it's blowing up big time.

27:42.911 --> 27:45.072
Not my fault entirely.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.787
And it's not stopping there.
The sun flares are
just the beginning.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.781
And we only have a few
hours before it goes critical.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.658
Okay, what are our options?

27:51.795 --> 27:53.877
If we can get
close enough to launch
a dispersion module,

27:54.006 --> 27:56.668
a concentration of
iron atoms fired directly
into the sun's core

27:56.800 --> 27:57.835
should cause it to implode.

27:57.968 --> 27:59.879
And imploding's a good thing?

28:00.012 --> 28:03.925
Yes. Once the sun's
incapable of fusion reaction,
then we'll all be safe.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.308
What if it
doesn't work?

28:05.434 --> 28:08.221
We all get front row
seats to a supernova
way bigger than Hiroshima.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.890
And Eureka becomes
a mile-deep crater.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.392
That's too risky.
We need to
evacuate now.

28:16.528 --> 28:17.859
Jo's already started.

28:17.988 --> 28:20.821
But this is also the most
advanced research complex
on the planet,

28:20.949 --> 28:22.610
and we have an opportunity
to save it.

28:22.743 --> 28:25.029
And I'm already
developing a compound
to trigger the implosion.

a delivery system.

evacuating the people

trying to save the town.
We're multitasking.

Sheriff, you might be
comfortable risking lives,
but I'm not.

gets out while
there's still time.

save decades of research.

wants to see the place
go up in flames.

aren't drenched

30:06.179 --> 30:09.091
It'll take two people
to get the module in
position for launch.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.179
I can do that on my own.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.721
No. I'll go with you.
I know this baby best.

30:12.853 --> 30:15.435

quickly if we need to,

but with ten evac
camps for 2,600 people.

would do something
about the heat.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.756
I hear your pain.

30:48.930 --> 30:52.593
This town needs a mayor
who can be cool in a crisis.
And if I'm elected,

30:52.726 --> 30:56.639
I promise I won't sleep
until darkness falls
again on Eureka.

provides twice daily.

science and over-baked bread.
Lucas is your man.

He can't bake his
way out of a paper bag.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.282
Oh, yeah,
like cloud maker's
a real job.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.496
What is wrong
with all of you?

31:16.625 --> 31:18.957
Eureka was founded to
protect the greater good.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.166
You're worried about votes.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.956
You should be
worried about lives.

31:22.089 --> 31:24.296
You cannot be a leader if
there is no town to lead.

31:24.424 --> 31:27.507
So I suggest you get
your priorities straight.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.512
That was beautiful.

31:35.143 --> 31:36.178
Having fun yet?

31:36.311 --> 31:38.097
Oh yeah, 'cause
driving headlong
into a fiery death

31:38.230 --> 31:39.970

of a good time.

Sometimes
I think it's his.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.232
Carter, could we
have a minute?

31:46.405 --> 31:48.521
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

31:50.283 --> 31:53.650

supposed to be miles away
at an evac camp by now.

life more often.

go all serious on me now.

It's too late.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.608
Shenﬁ.

32:32.242 --> 32:33.778
I thought we
agreed to evacuate.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.070
We did. So what are
you still doing here?

32:35.203 --> 32:37.159
None of your business.
Don't play games.

32:37.289 --> 32:40.873
I'm not. I think Zane's
device is going to work.
Probably.

32:41.001 --> 32:43.037
If you don't die first.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.334
That is part of the job.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.792
And the men in that
bunker would know that.

is you think you know

32:50.218 --> 32:53.176
about what you found
or about me, it's wrong.

Maybe.

32:54.431 --> 32:55.796
But I'm just getting started.

32:55.932 --> 32:57.888
You know,
if there's one thing
I've learned in life,

32:58.018 --> 33:00.851
is that nobody
should be left behind,
no matter what the reason.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.685
And that includes you.

33:04.858 --> 33:08.476
Ms. Thorne, l'm duty bound
to enforce this evacuation.

33:08.612 --> 33:11.069
Jo, make sure she
gets out of town safely.

33:11.198 --> 33:13.280
And no, that's
not a request.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.166

pretty bad. You sure
the rocket can handle it?

Okay, Carter, what's wrong?

33:59.079 --> 34:01.161
It's Zane's module.
The electronics are fried.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.244
Do you have any
spares lying around?

34:02.374 --> 34:04.615
Okay, G.D. has plenty
of short range
booster assemblies.

34:04.751 --> 34:07.367
We just need to
adapt them to the
X.R.T.'s specifications.

34:07.504 --> 34:08.789
We'll never make
it back in time.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.378
There is another way.

34:10.507 --> 34:13.044
Dr. Herrera's
hydrogen seeding device.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.792
It uses similar
boosters to the X.R.T.

34:16.346 --> 34:18.587
But my greenhouse is
too close to that sun.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.805
And there's no way
they'll ever
survive the heat.

34:20.934 --> 34:23.016
Well, hold on.
Maybe there is.

34:23.937 --> 34:24.892
ALLISON: What
are you thinking?

34:25.021 --> 34:28.980

earlier. We just need to
stay cool under pressure.

this heat protection formula
for weeks.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.321
Sure that'll work?

34:41.454 --> 34:43.035
It's a prototype.

34:43.707 --> 34:46.870
But it's over engineered
to respond to increased
body heat and adrenaline.

34:47.002 --> 34:50.460
Well, we're taking on
a supernova so we should
have plenty of both.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.454
ZANE: All you gotta do
is slather it on.

34:52.591 --> 34:56.630
