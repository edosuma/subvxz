00:30.177 --> 00:32.011
(door bangs in distance)

00:42.189 --> 00:43.389
(Ryan whistles)

00:43.473 --> 00:44.857
Here, boy.

00:50.113 --> 00:53.682
(Wilfred moaning)

00:56.686 --> 00:59.872
(Wilfred panting, grunting)

01:06.913 --> 01:08.881
(grunting continues)

01:13.970 --> 01:15.588
(screaming)

01:15.672 --> 01:17.506
Ryan! Ryan, help me!

01:17.557 --> 01:19.975
Water! Water!

01:20.043 --> 01:21.010
(screaming continues)

01:26.800 --> 01:28.667
Oh!

01:28.718 --> 01:30.335
Oh...!

01:31.638 --> 01:33.355
Oh...

01:34.641 --> 01:35.975
Oh.

01:38.011 --> 01:42.537
Oh, man, my penis is in
bad shape right now.

01:42.933 --> 01:44.617
I can barely stand up straight.

01:44.684 --> 01:48.537
That glory hole
shit out there...

01:48.622 --> 01:52.024
that... was... beautiful.

01:54.377 --> 01:58.130
Pussy without a name
or face or personality

01:58.198 --> 02:00.583
is the perfect kind of pussy.

02:00.667 --> 02:03.252
I think Anne wants to move out.

02:03.336 --> 02:04.803
Really?

02:04.871 --> 02:08.039
Well, I have managed
to lick off every morsel

02:08.091 --> 02:10.726
of biological detritus
her body has to offer.

02:10.810 --> 02:12.178
So maybe it's time.

02:12.229 --> 02:13.896
No, it sucks.

02:13.980 --> 02:15.648
We get along great.

02:15.715 --> 02:17.650
She hasn't threatened
my relationship with you,

02:17.717 --> 02:20.069
plus her rent has given me
the time to figure out

02:20.153 --> 02:22.271
what I actually want
to do with my life.

02:22.355 --> 02:23.822
Now I'm gonna feel
all this pressure

02:23.890 --> 02:25.441
to get a job right away.

02:25.525 --> 02:28.393
You know, sometimes
pressure's a good thing.

02:28.445 --> 02:30.496
I've been pressured into
every job I've ever had.

02:30.563 --> 02:32.731
I'm just gonna end up
doing something I hate.

02:32.782 --> 02:35.951
Okay, so we already know
you don't want to be

02:36.036 --> 02:37.419
an evil-type lawyer again.

02:37.504 --> 02:39.288
So let's start from there.

02:39.372 --> 02:42.258
Wait-- I thought you hated
the idea of me getting a job.

02:42.342 --> 02:43.909
Under normal
circumstances, sure.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.427
But you're stuck in a rut.

02:45.512 --> 02:46.845
And I'm worried about you.

02:46.913 --> 02:48.464
True or false?

02:48.548 --> 02:51.183
Last Wednesday, you went online
and purchased a Lego

02:51.251 --> 02:53.385
do-it-yourself medieval
market village.

02:53.436 --> 02:56.605
So what?
Legos are not for adults!

02:56.690 --> 02:58.557
I canceled the order.

02:58.608 --> 03:01.110
All you do is sit around
and sleep and eat.

03:01.194 --> 03:04.563
Yeah, and I also roll around
in goose shit.

03:04.614 --> 03:06.334
Look, I'm already in touch
with a recruiter.

03:06.366 --> 03:07.933
I'm gonna set up a meeting
right now.

03:07.984 --> 03:10.119
If you're on
the Legos Web site,

03:10.203 --> 03:12.204
you are a creepy
man-child.

03:13.907 --> 03:15.241
(Ryan laughing)

03:15.292 --> 03:16.492
Oh, you're burning down!

03:16.576 --> 03:17.776
That was awesome!

03:17.827 --> 03:19.712
Oh, my God.
You were right.

03:19.779 --> 03:22.081
Those fitness games I was
playing are boring as shit

03:22.132 --> 03:24.449
compared to "The Haunted
Catacombs of Gjorganthaal."

03:24.501 --> 03:25.784
See?!
What?

03:25.835 --> 03:27.386
Wait-- why are you pausing it?

03:27.453 --> 03:29.014
Didn't you have
to be somewhere at 2:00?

03:29.089 --> 03:31.009
Yeah, I was supposed to meet
with this recruiter,

03:31.091 --> 03:32.591
but I rescheduled it.

03:32.642 --> 03:34.459
My résumé needs some tweaking

03:34.511 --> 03:35.644
I hope you didn't reschedule it
for Monday,

03:35.729 --> 03:36.769
because I have a surprise.

03:36.813 --> 03:38.463
I'm treating us to massages.

03:38.515 --> 03:40.632
It's just a thank you
for being my date

03:40.684 --> 03:42.005
to Erica's dinner party
last week.

03:42.068 --> 03:43.519
It would have been super
depressing being

03:43.603 --> 03:45.354
the only single person there.

03:45.438 --> 03:47.189
Yeah, I'm-I'm not sure I can...
Now don't worry!

03:47.274 --> 03:48.607
I'm still working the
Internet dating sites.

03:48.658 --> 03:50.378
And as soon as I find
a guy who's not making

03:50.443 --> 03:52.077
that annoying squinty sex face

03:52.145 --> 03:53.579
in his profile picture,
you're off the hook.

03:53.646 --> 03:55.147
No, no, no, it's not that.

03:55.198 --> 03:56.648
I just don't think
I can make the massage.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.701
I should probably stick
with this job hunt for a while

03:58.785 --> 03:59.702
until I get something.

03:59.786 --> 04:01.503
Really? Bummer.

04:01.588 --> 04:05.040
Kind of enjoyed being
"funemployed" together.

04:05.125 --> 04:07.426
Yeah, well, I found out
Anne's looking for a new place.

04:07.493 --> 04:09.878
And there's no way I can pay
the bills without her rent.

04:09.963 --> 04:11.463
Why is she leaving?

04:11.514 --> 04:13.716
You haven't asked her?

04:13.800 --> 04:16.668
If I were you, I'd do whatever
it takes to keep her there.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.437
You're right.

04:18.504 --> 04:20.939
I'll talk to her.

04:23.443 --> 04:24.943
Oh. Good morning.

04:25.011 --> 04:27.313
Hey.

04:27.364 --> 04:30.115
So, um...

04:30.183 --> 04:34.703
I-I-I don't know how to
ask this without asking.

04:34.788 --> 04:37.122
Are-Are you thinking
of moving out?

04:37.190 --> 04:41.026
(sighs) Okay, I was gonna
tell you eventually.

04:41.077 --> 04:43.245
You know how my boyfriend's

04:43.330 --> 04:45.414
in jail for head butting
his aunt?

04:45.498 --> 04:47.633
I-I didn't know those details.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.385
Well, before he got sentenced,

04:49.469 --> 04:52.371
he made this, like, investment
for when he got out.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.139
He bought this purebred
English bulldog

04:54.207 --> 04:55.841
to start a breeding business.

04:55.892 --> 04:59.511
His mom's watching Phil,
that's the dog's name,

04:59.562 --> 05:03.015
but she's moving to Boston,
so offered to take the dog.

05:03.066 --> 05:04.650
And I just figured
with Wilfred around,

05:04.717 --> 05:08.153
two dogs in the house
would just make your life crazy.

05:08.221 --> 05:10.272
No! No, no, no!
Not at all.

05:10.357 --> 05:11.890
Really?

05:11.941 --> 05:13.442
Seriously, it's not a problem.

05:13.526 --> 05:16.111
Phil is totally welcome
to come live here.

05:16.196 --> 05:19.698
(laughs) Oh, my God,
that is so awesome!

05:19.749 --> 05:21.200
If I didn't have a boyfriend,

05:21.251 --> 05:22.918
I would totally suck
your nuts right now.

05:23.002 --> 05:25.671
(chuckles weakly)

05:25.738 --> 05:27.506
So, just when I finally
neutralized

05:27.573 --> 05:29.208
the Jelly Beans threat,

05:29.259 --> 05:31.576
you invite this bulldog
to come and live with us?!

05:31.628 --> 05:33.629
There's only so much dog poon
to go around!

05:33.713 --> 05:35.964
And you know this Phil guy's
gonna be creeping up

05:36.049 --> 05:37.466
on the neighborhood glory hole!

05:37.550 --> 05:39.134
That shit is locals only!

05:39.219 --> 05:41.637
It's, like, go back
to the Val, kook!

05:41.721 --> 05:43.761
Wilfred, you don't even live
here-- you're my guest.

05:43.773 --> 05:45.257
Anne has a right
to have guests, too.

05:50.647 --> 05:51.864
What the hell are you doing?!

05:51.931 --> 05:53.598
Drawing a line in the sand.

05:53.650 --> 05:56.285
Phil can stay on his side,
I'll stay on my side.

05:56.369 --> 05:57.936
Wilfred, stop!

05:57.987 --> 06:00.823
Fine. Then I suppose
I'll have to resort

06:00.907 --> 06:02.274
to more drastic measures.

06:04.544 --> 06:06.545
Wait-- what are you gonna do?

06:06.612 --> 06:08.130
I'm gonna get my squeaky ball

06:08.214 --> 06:09.915
and leave it on
the living room floor

06:09.966 --> 06:12.167
where Phil can see it.

06:12.252 --> 06:14.553
Then, when our little friend
goes to play with it,

06:14.620 --> 06:15.921
I'll simply...

06:15.972 --> 06:19.291
snatch... it... back.

06:20.793 --> 06:22.961
Guess I can't stop you.

06:23.012 --> 06:26.465
(sing-songy):
Welcome to your new home!

06:26.516 --> 06:27.733
Hey.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.319
So this must be Phil.

06:30.403 --> 06:31.820
Why is he wearing a diaper?

06:31.905 --> 06:33.272
Phil's short for "Phyllis."

06:34.307 --> 06:35.574
So...

06:35.641 --> 06:37.142
She's in heat right now.

06:37.193 --> 06:38.494
Sorry. I didn't know
till I picked her up.

06:38.578 --> 06:41.780
So we should keep her
and Wilfred apart.

06:41.831 --> 06:43.415
You know how crazy
male dogs get

06:43.483 --> 06:45.167
when they smell
a bitch in heat. (scoffs)

06:45.251 --> 06:47.169
Is this still cool with you?

06:47.253 --> 06:49.588
'Cause if not, I can totally...

06:49.655 --> 06:50.956
What? No, no, no, no!

06:51.007 --> 06:53.375
Of course, it's totally cool.

06:53.460 --> 06:56.462
Thanks. I really appreciate
this, Ryan.

06:56.513 --> 06:58.013
Don't worry about it.

06:58.097 --> 07:00.015
Like I said, it won't be
a problem at all.

07:02.135 --> 07:04.887
Oh, my God...

07:04.971 --> 07:06.772
she's beautiful, Ryan.

07:06.839 --> 07:09.525
Sculpted by
the hands of angels.

07:09.609 --> 07:11.477
You didn't even see her.

07:11.528 --> 07:13.395
I didn't have to.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.448
(inhales deeply)

07:16.516 --> 07:17.733
I'm in love.

07:17.817 --> 07:18.984

of poured out of me.

08:13.271 --> 08:15.022
I guess that's what happens

08:15.073 --> 08:16.547
when love slaps you around
like a little ho.

08:16.631 --> 08:18.498
I can't wait
for Phyllis to hear it.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.384
It's not gonna happen, Wilfred.

08:20.451 --> 08:24.171
Look, I know you're worried,
'cause now I'm in love,

08:24.255 --> 08:25.672
we're not gonna hang out
as much.

08:25.757 --> 08:27.975
But you've always been
my best friend.

08:28.059 --> 08:32.645
Which is why I'd like
you to have this.

08:32.730 --> 08:34.231
It's my little black book.

08:34.298 --> 08:36.566
I won't be needing it anymore.

08:38.568 --> 08:40.270
Are these urine stains?

08:40.321 --> 08:43.523
Contact information
from my former slut stable.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.475
I was a different dog then.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.527
Which reminds me.

08:47.612 --> 08:50.530
I no longer have any use...

08:50.615 --> 08:53.533
for my vampire dick sucker.

08:53.618 --> 08:56.837
Oh, Fangsy, we really had
ourselves quite a time.

09:01.676 --> 09:04.661
(sniffs)
Where is Phyllis?

09:04.712 --> 09:06.996
Locked up in Anne's room,
where you can't get to her.

09:07.048 --> 09:11.000
Ryan, no door can stand
in the way of love.

09:11.052 --> 09:13.520
Unless it's, like, a door-door.

09:13.604 --> 09:15.222
Does it have a doorknob?

09:15.306 --> 09:17.107
Dude!

09:17.174 --> 09:18.809
Wilfred, you're not in love.

09:18.860 --> 09:20.727
You're just responding
to her pheromones.

09:20.812 --> 09:22.512
And you're just
tearing us apart,

09:22.563 --> 09:24.815
so you can keep Anne
as a cash cow.

09:24.866 --> 09:27.067
Phyllis is in heat, and you're
an unneutered male dog.

09:27.151 --> 09:28.819
You could get her pregnant.

09:28.870 --> 09:30.787
And the only litter
that she's supposed to have

09:30.855 --> 09:32.155
is with another
purebred bulldog.

09:32.206 --> 09:35.959
Are you saying that my moonbeam
and the darkness

09:36.026 --> 09:38.829
of my lonely night
is promised to another?

09:38.880 --> 09:40.831
Sort of.
Anne's boyfriend's a breeder.

09:40.882 --> 09:42.582
But that's insane!

09:42.667 --> 09:45.001
If it's another bulldog,
then he could be her brother

09:45.053 --> 09:47.471
or her cousin
or a distant uncle at best!

09:47.538 --> 09:49.139
How would you feel

09:49.206 --> 09:50.757
if that's how humans
were forced to procreate?!

09:50.842 --> 09:54.594
It's different.
We're human.

09:54.679 --> 09:56.229
Okay, may-maybe... maybe
that came out wrong.

09:56.314 --> 09:57.397
You're a Nazi!

09:57.482 --> 09:58.932
You're a goddamn Nazi!

09:59.016 --> 10:01.768
Don't you even try
to get between us, Ryan.

10:01.853 --> 10:04.488

Oh, Phyllis,

10:24.008 --> 10:25.792
your kisses taste so sweet

10:25.877 --> 10:28.595
and your pores smell
like corn chips.

10:39.423 --> 10:42.142
Oh, my deep tissue is thanking

10:42.226 --> 10:43.727
the shit out of you right now.

10:43.778 --> 10:45.645
Glad you found it relaxing.

10:45.730 --> 10:48.198
By the way, you two make
a really cute couple.

10:48.265 --> 10:49.599
Oh.

10:51.953 --> 10:53.370
Why did you tell the
masseuse we're a couple?

10:53.437 --> 10:54.621
'Cause the couple's massage came

10:54.705 --> 10:56.907
with a free bottle of wine.

11:00.411 --> 11:02.712
(sniffing)

11:07.668 --> 11:09.085
So, how'd it go with Anne?

11:09.137 --> 11:10.337
Great.

11:10.421 --> 11:11.671
I talked to her like you said

11:11.756 --> 11:13.056
and we worked everything out.

11:13.123 --> 11:15.291
To "funemployment."

11:15.343 --> 11:16.510
So what do you want
to do tonight?

11:16.594 --> 11:18.061
Korean barbeque or we...

11:18.128 --> 11:19.930
Oh, shit.
Is it Monday?

11:19.981 --> 11:22.182
(groans) I'm supposed to go
with Jessica to a party tonight

11:22.266 --> 11:25.134
at some rich
ophthalmologist's house.

11:25.186 --> 11:27.226
I guess it's remotely possible
I could meet someone.

11:27.238 --> 11:29.272
No worries.
We'll hang out later.

11:29.323 --> 11:31.942
I'm gonna get dressed and
head home for a long nap.

11:37.665 --> 11:40.316
So, how are you feeling today?

11:40.368 --> 11:42.118
It's weird.

11:42.170 --> 11:45.154
I woke up and I don't
know how to explain it,

11:45.206 --> 11:48.542
but something deep in
my heart had changed.

11:48.626 --> 11:50.844
It's like all the love
I felt for Phyllis

11:50.928 --> 11:51.661
is now suddenly gone.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.163
That does happen sometimes.

11:54.215 --> 11:56.883
You can fall out of love just
as quickly as you fell into it.

11:56.968 --> 11:58.885
Huh, you know,
I don't even care

11:58.970 --> 12:01.721
if she ends up with
another bulldog.

12:01.806 --> 12:03.056
Hell, maybe they'd be
better off together.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.173
Well...

12:04.225 --> 12:05.442
breeding is done for a reason.

12:05.509 --> 12:07.477
Mating a purebred
with another purebred

12:07.528 --> 12:09.863
keeps things... pure.

12:09.947 --> 12:11.898
Yeah.

12:11.983 --> 12:14.651
I got to admit, now that
my mind is no longer lost

12:14.702 --> 12:17.037
in the fog of love,
it's starting to make sense.

12:17.121 --> 12:19.623
I mean, you mix up the breeds,
who knows what you're gonna get?

12:19.690 --> 12:20.574
Exactly.

12:20.658 --> 12:22.859
Like, take Joffrey here.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.360
(laughs)
Wait...

12:24.412 --> 12:26.746
What?
WILFRED: Well, he-he's the product

12:26.831 --> 12:28.999
of a white mother
and a Mexican father.

12:29.050 --> 12:30.667
He's a mutt, just like me.

12:30.718 --> 12:32.385
It's different
with people, Wilfred.

12:32.470 --> 12:33.920
Joffrey's fine.

12:34.005 --> 12:34.921
Joffrey and I
are both mongrels.

12:35.006 --> 12:36.089
We're mistakes.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.557
Now, I-I wouldn't say you're...

12:37.642 --> 12:39.059
No, no, no, you're
totally right.

12:39.143 --> 12:41.061
Just imagine a world

12:41.145 --> 12:43.563
where all of the bloodlines
were kept pure--

12:43.648 --> 12:45.765
a perfect world where
there were no mistakes.

12:45.850 --> 12:47.684
(phone vibrating)

12:49.353 --> 12:51.605
That's that job recruiter.

12:51.689 --> 12:54.223
You going to that meeting
with her tomorrow, right?

12:54.275 --> 12:55.892
I don't know.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.994
I mean, now that Anne's staying,
what's the rush?

12:58.062 --> 13:02.032
Ryan, if this whole Phyllis
ordeal has taught me anything,

13:02.083 --> 13:05.619
it's that it feels good
to move on with your life.

13:05.703 --> 13:07.170
On to bigger and better things.

13:07.237 --> 13:08.922
Hmm.

13:09.006 --> 13:11.174
Hendler-Greer specializes
in green energy

13:11.241 --> 13:13.076
and they're looking
for a junior partner.

13:13.127 --> 13:16.263
Well, actually I'm sort of
leaning towards nonprofit.

13:16.347 --> 13:18.848
Okay.

13:18.916 --> 13:20.634
Well, have you heard
of New Horizons?

13:20.718 --> 13:22.752
They're a nonprofit
that provides legal counsel

13:22.803 --> 13:24.638
for victims of domestic abuse.

13:24.722 --> 13:27.090
Yeah, that-that sounds great.

13:27.141 --> 13:28.975
But I worry that it's
a little too outside

13:29.060 --> 13:30.694
of my area of expertise.

13:32.396 --> 13:33.313
(sighs)

13:33.397 --> 13:34.698
Sorry, I...

13:34.765 --> 13:36.283
I guess I'm kind
of a challenge.

13:36.367 --> 13:37.767
It's okay.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.369
I like a challenge.

13:39.436 --> 13:42.072
I'm sure, if we work together
long enough,

13:42.123 --> 13:44.003
I'll find something
that'll pique your interest.

13:44.075 --> 13:46.576
Uh...

13:46.627 --> 13:49.879
I-I don't understand.

13:49.947 --> 13:51.948
Are you ready to get
your dick sucked, Ryan?

14:07.515 --> 14:08.181
Oh!

14:08.265 --> 14:10.967
(gasping)

14:11.018 --> 14:12.802
Wh-What's going on?

14:12.853 --> 14:15.014
I've been doing a little
pure-breeding of my own, mate.

14:15.022 --> 14:18.474
I think I'll name
your baby Rysten.

14:20.077 --> 14:21.911
(door closes)

14:26.716 --> 14:27.682
Wilfred!

14:27.767 --> 14:28.850
Get back here!

14:34.974 --> 14:36.841
Shit.

14:38.361 --> 14:39.778
(phone line ringing)

14:39.845 --> 14:40.845
It's Kristen, leave a message.

14:40.896 --> 14:41.863
(voicemail beeps)

14:41.948 --> 14:44.149
Hey, uh, I-I don't know

14:44.200 --> 14:46.484
if you're still taking your nap,
but I'm gonna be

14:46.535 --> 14:47.786
in your neighborhood,
so I thought I'd drop by.

14:47.853 --> 14:49.871
See you soon.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.208
Kristen.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.693
Kristen!

14:55.745 --> 14:56.995
(phone ringing)

14:58.414 --> 14:59.881
Kristen, where are you?

14:59.966 --> 15:01.532
I'm at your place.
My place?

15:01.584 --> 15:02.968
When I couldn't find my phone,
I realized

15:03.035 --> 15:04.252
I must've left it here
earlier today.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.503
WILFRED:
Or perhaps someone stole it.

15:05.554 --> 15:06.805
Wilfred's there?

15:06.872 --> 15:08.206
Yeah, he was here
when I came in.

15:08.257 --> 15:09.557
WILFRED: Breeding a brother
with his sister

15:09.642 --> 15:11.593
can only result in perfect...

15:11.677 --> 15:13.511
Get away from him, Kristen.

15:13.562 --> 15:14.813
I'll be right there.

15:16.382 --> 15:18.733
Hey, Ryan.
Wilfred, get out of there.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.235
(Wilfred and Kristen laughing)

15:21.553 --> 15:23.438
Ow!
What are you doing?

15:23.522 --> 15:25.023
Uh, I have to take him out.

15:26.725 --> 15:29.027
Please, tell me
you didn't do it.

15:29.078 --> 15:31.198
You mean extract your semen
and inseminate your sister

15:31.247 --> 15:33.081
so she can give birth
to a purebred Newman?

15:35.167 --> 15:37.335
Of course I didn't.
I'm not that sick and twisted.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.454
I just wanted you
to think I would,

15:39.538 --> 15:41.956
so you can see what it's
like to almost get bred.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.958
What?! Why?

15:44.043 --> 15:45.260
All that fear and
disgust you just felt?

15:45.344 --> 15:47.245
That's exactly what
Phyllis is feeling.

15:47.296 --> 15:48.630
Instead of being
with the one dog

15:48.714 --> 15:50.548
she actually cares about-- me.

15:50.599 --> 15:53.418
We should be making tender,
passionate love right now,

15:53.469 --> 15:56.054
stuck ass-to-ass with
my dick bent backwards

15:56.105 --> 15:57.722
between my legs in
excruciating pain

15:57.773 --> 15:59.190
under the stars.

15:59.258 --> 16:01.643
What? I thought
you were over Phyllis.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.945
What? Because of this?

16:05.031 --> 16:07.982
You knew? How?

16:08.067 --> 16:09.868
I went on your iPad to change
my relationship status

16:09.935 --> 16:11.286
to "It's complicated,"

16:11.370 --> 16:13.705
and I saw the Web site
on your browser.

16:13.772 --> 16:15.123
So you knowingly tortured me
'cause you still

16:15.207 --> 16:16.574
think you're in love?

16:16.625 --> 16:18.126
For the last time,
I am in love.

16:18.210 --> 16:19.544
With someone who's destined

16:19.611 --> 16:21.546
to boned by her
own family member.

16:21.613 --> 16:24.299
So, what? Dogs don't care if
they have sex with a relative.

16:24.383 --> 16:26.217
Not if we don't get
a say in the matter.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.303
I chose to have sex
with my sister

16:28.387 --> 16:30.171
and my aunt and my grandfather.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.923
Making me think
I've impregnated my sister

16:31.974 --> 16:34.059
isn't even in the same ballpark
as dog breeding.

16:34.126 --> 16:36.344
How did you come up
with this insane plan?

16:36.429 --> 16:37.512
It's obvious.

16:37.596 --> 16:38.813
I got it from Kristen.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.298
Well, she's basically

16:40.349 --> 16:42.133
been playing house
with you lately.

16:42.184 --> 16:43.664
Treating her brother
like her husband.

16:43.736 --> 16:44.986
What are you talking about?

16:45.071 --> 16:46.471
She keeps using you as a crutch

16:46.522 --> 16:47.802
the same way you keep
using Anne.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.242
Phyllis!

16:51.310 --> 16:53.995
We will be together one day.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.647
I promise!

16:56.699 --> 16:58.983
(boom box playing dogs howling)

17:04.006 --> 17:04.923
Hey.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.991
I was thinking

17:07.041 --> 17:09.594
since I'm already here,
we might as well order in;

17:09.661 --> 17:11.262
watch a movie.

17:11.329 --> 17:12.797
Still haven't seen
<i>Django Unchained.</i>

17:12.848 --> 17:14.665
What? I-I thought

17:14.717 --> 17:16.550
you were going to that party
with your girlfriends tonight.

17:16.635 --> 17:19.002
I'll just cancel-- honestly
I'm just not really in the mood

17:19.054 --> 17:21.222
to get dressed up
and deal with that whole scene.

17:23.893 --> 17:26.010
Yeah, I think you
should go to that party.

17:26.060 --> 17:29.314
Look, I know it must be hard.

17:29.365 --> 17:31.816
After your divorce,
getting back out there.

17:31.867 --> 17:34.486
It's daunting, but...

17:34.537 --> 17:37.038
I don't, I don't think
it's good to, you know,

17:37.123 --> 17:40.241
become so dependent on this
comfortable thing we've got.

17:42.661 --> 17:44.496
I know.

17:44.547 --> 17:46.247
You're right.

17:46.332 --> 17:47.999
For what it's worth,

17:48.050 --> 17:50.718
I'm doing the exact same
thing with this job search.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.588
It's like... what
if I get rejected?

17:53.672 --> 17:56.007
What if I fail?

17:56.058 --> 17:59.093
But I guess, at a certain point,
it's more dangerous

17:59.178 --> 18:00.979
to not move forward
with your life.

18:02.681 --> 18:05.016
(sighs)

18:13.225 --> 18:15.994
Uh, is that a fanged
blow job giver?

18:17.913 --> 18:21.249
Um...

18:21.333 --> 18:24.735
So, I asked Anne
to move out this morning.

18:24.787 --> 18:27.205
I've been putting off
getting a job for too long.

18:27.256 --> 18:29.757
It's a good thing,
mate-- trust me.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.043
Although, as you know,
if Phyllis leaves,

18:32.094 --> 18:33.545
then I'll have to
leave with her,

18:33.596 --> 18:35.847
because I will follow her
to the ends of the earth

18:35.914 --> 18:37.098
until the end of time.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.684
Yeah, and...
I've been thinking.

18:39.751 --> 18:42.270
Maybe some of what you said
about breeding is true.

18:42.354 --> 18:45.256
Thank you, Ryan;
I appreciate that.

18:45.307 --> 18:47.275
In good time,
you, too, will see

18:47.359 --> 18:49.978
that Phyllis and I
truly are soul mates,

18:50.062 --> 18:53.097
and that our love will
one day transcend...

18:53.148 --> 18:54.765
Oh, my God!

18:54.817 --> 18:56.985
Who is that disgusting
pig-like creature?

18:57.069 --> 18:59.454
That's Phyllis.
No way.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.706
That's a butter everything.

19:01.773 --> 19:03.791
She's basically the
dog version of Natalie

19:03.876 --> 19:05.076
from <i>The Facts of Life.</i>
Yeah.

19:05.127 --> 19:06.828
I'm telling you,
Wilfred, that's her.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.112
WILFRED: Really?
Yeah.

19:08.163 --> 19:09.714
And, look, she's no longer
wearing a diaper

19:09.781 --> 19:12.217
because she's probably
no longer in heat...

19:12.284 --> 19:15.470
which is why you're probably
no longer in love.

19:15.554 --> 19:20.391
No... I just think she looks
different in the daylight.

19:20.459 --> 19:22.644
Right.

19:25.754 --> 19:28.196
Again, I'm really sorry that it
didn't work out with the dogs.

19:28.316 --> 19:30.383
It just got a little
too crazy with Wilfred.

19:30.430 --> 19:33.384
Oh, I totally understand, Ryan.
It's for the best.

19:33.504 --> 19:35.454
And Northern California
will be nice,

19:35.506 --> 19:36.989
and I'll be closer
to my boyfriend.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.624
Well, his prison.

19:38.675 --> 19:40.877
Take care.

19:40.961 --> 19:43.429
You, too. It's been fun.

19:45.599 --> 19:48.184
Sorry. There was a line
at the glory hole.

19:48.268 --> 19:50.002
And then this Chihuahua
got stuck,

19:50.053 --> 19:52.471
and his whole body was just,
like, dangling there.

19:52.523 --> 19:54.473
Oh. Did I miss the good-byes?

19:54.525 --> 19:56.192
Yeah.

19:56.276 --> 19:58.677
Well, I'm sure
I'll see Anne again one day.

19:58.729 --> 20:01.347
I look forward to meeting
her future son, Andrew.

20:01.398 --> 20:02.982
Andrew?

20:03.033 --> 20:05.701
Why would she name her son An...
(engine starts)

20:05.786 --> 20:06.786
...drew?
