WEBVTT

00:56.139 --> 00:59.142
On an adventureWith the Wolfe family

00:59.226 --> 01:01.186
Who knows what we'll discover

01:01.270 --> 01:06.650
Just Custard, Mum and me

01:07.693 --> 01:11.071
All right. Time for one more,'cause we're almost there.

01:15.158 --> 01:18.370
Hey, come on.Boarding school's gonna be great.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.581
Just think of it as a new adventure.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.001
It doesn't feel very adventure-y.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.586
Sure it does.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.672
You're heading out on your owninto the unknown.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.424
How adventure-y is that?

01:33.343 --> 01:36.346
I guess that's kind of adventure-y.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.850
Okay. Yeah.It's a good thing I'm prepared.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.768
Behold!

01:45.647 --> 01:47.441
What exactly am I beholding?

01:47.524 --> 01:50.152
It's a light lance. I made it last night.

01:50.694 --> 01:53.363
I call it Excaliboom.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.365
But why?

01:55.449 --> 01:57.409
You said this school has a lake.

01:57.492 --> 02:00.287
Well, if there's a lake,there'll be a lake monster.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.373
Maybe even a mud-bellied leviathan.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.919
When I said adventure, I meant more

02:07.002 --> 02:10.881
getting out thereand maybe making some friends.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.884
You think I should make friendswith the leviathan.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.136
Interesting.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.347
Better brush up on my monster slang.

02:18.430 --> 02:23.310
You don't wanna go saying the wrong thingto a mud-bellied leviathan. Trust me.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.708
This time will be better. I promise.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.044
You said that last time.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.547
Can't I just stay home with you?

02:51.630 --> 02:55.425
I'm sorry, darling. This is for the best.

02:57.553 --> 02:59.513
It's okay to feel worried,

02:59.596 --> 03:01.515
and it's okay to feel scared.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.893
That's how all the best adventures start.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.230
You just need to give them a chance.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.315
Let them get to know you.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.236
You don't need to stayin your own little world all the time.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.988
But I like my world.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.282
I don't wanna be stuck in this world.

03:18.365 --> 03:22.578
It's boring and normal,and no one wants me in their world anyway.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.955
Hey, hey. Now, you listen to me--

03:25.038 --> 03:27.749
They think I'm weird, Mum.

03:27.833 --> 03:31.211
They call me names.They always laugh at me.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.303
Mum, do you think I'm weird?

03:40.470 --> 03:41.972
Yes.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.892
And I wouldn't have you any other way.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.894
You're a dreamer.

03:46.977 --> 03:51.315
And it's the beautiful oddballs like youwho make a difference

03:51.398 --> 03:54.776
and change this boring old worldfor the better.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.530
You just haveto find your place, that's all.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.200
I'm so proud of you.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.079
Well, will you be okay without me?

04:06.163 --> 04:10.125
Of course I will.I've got my mask too, remember?

04:15.005 --> 04:16.464
What's wrong?

04:16.548 --> 04:17.966
Nothing. Nothing.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.386
We're just going to miss you.

04:41.823 --> 04:42.950
Lame mask.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.786
You look like a wolf.

05:01.176 --> 05:04.137
Hello, new kid.What's with the weird mask?

05:04.221 --> 05:05.472
Nothing.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.767
-Is that a treasure map?-Well, yeah.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.018
Why?

05:10.102 --> 05:12.688
Well, every explorer needs a map.

05:13.605 --> 05:16.525
Hey, check it out.He thinks he's a pirate.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.529
He thinks he's a pirate.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.447
Hey! Get off! What are you doing?

05:22.531 --> 05:23.907
Please.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.492
Oh, my gosh.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.161
Wow.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.831
Check it out.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.347
This is so not adventure-y.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.771
Oh, wow.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.107
Hello.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.609
Where do you come from?

05:59.568 --> 06:01.653
Hey! Do you have a name?

06:09.745 --> 06:11.079
Where'd you go?

06:15.417 --> 06:16.585
Hey!

06:17.544 --> 06:20.297
Don't worry, little cloud. I'll save you.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.971
Hurry up, Sprout. We're gonna be late.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.973
He's so slippery.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.268
-If that thing gets me wet---That thing has a name,

06:33.352 --> 06:35.479
which, as you well know, is Floof.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.147
I am not calling it that.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.316
Oh, crumbs.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.250
Wow.

06:58.877 --> 07:03.006
You know, Xandra, I don't thinkyou're taking this project seriously.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.051
We were supposed to loveand care for Floof.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.220
You were the one who let it escape.

07:08.303 --> 07:11.306
Floof just wanted to get up hereand be a grown-up cloud.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.684
Don't you, my little Floofy face?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.352
Okay, let's go.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.814
Auntie Xandra's beinga grumpy bum, isn't she?

07:18.897 --> 07:20.732
Sprout, get in the portal.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.776
A grumpy, grumpy bum.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.653
Sprout, if you don't get in that--

07:24.736 --> 07:27.072
A grumpy, grumpy, grumpy-- Hey!

07:27.155 --> 07:28.156
Bum.

07:32.703 --> 07:35.122
Curiouser and curiouser.

08:18.207 --> 08:19.208
Hello?

08:24.379 --> 08:25.380
Hello?

08:28.217 --> 08:31.553
-You following us, pal?-Yeah, pal?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.057
I was just--

08:35.140 --> 08:37.308
What are you doing with that poor cloud?

08:37.392 --> 08:40.770
Floof? Oh, he's a friend of Floof's.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.273
No, Sprout. He's a human.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.567
A human?

08:45.651 --> 08:49.112
Of course I'm a human.What else would I be?

08:49.196 --> 08:51.615
And what is this place?

08:51.698 --> 08:54.910
Nowhere. No place. It's a secret.

08:54.993 --> 08:59.039
I mean, a dream. All a dream.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.874
You're not supposed to be here.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.544
You'll have to gobefore you get us in trouble.

09:03.627 --> 09:06.171
No, wait. I don't want to go back.

09:06.255 --> 09:10.342
I'm not a human.I'm... whatever you guys are.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.261
Oh, you're a spryte.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.054
Yeah, one of those.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.557
Can you see me?

09:18.100 --> 09:19.142
Yes.

09:19.226 --> 09:24.273
See, he can't be a human.Humans can't see sprytes, you big silly.

09:24.356 --> 09:25.816
A spryte, huh?

09:25.899 --> 09:29.778
Okay, if you're a spryte,you'll know where the Cloud Lab is.

09:29.862 --> 09:33.115
-Of course.-Where is it then?

09:33.198 --> 09:35.659
Easy. It's right...

09:37.244 --> 09:38.370
here.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.832
And by here, I of course meant...

09:42.416 --> 09:43.667
here.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.751
Just kidding.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.004
It's actually--

09:51.383 --> 09:53.385
Okay, okay. Last one.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.232
What is this place?

10:48.315 --> 10:51.652
What do you mean?It's the Everything Factory, silly.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.031
So, what kind of spryte are you, anyway?

10:56.865 --> 10:58.075
Well...

10:58.158 --> 10:59.910
This is just great.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.080
We need to get him back to the human realmbefore someone notices--

11:03.163 --> 11:06.124
Just what are you sprytes doing?Lollygagging?

11:07.334 --> 11:08.752
I would never.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.547
Professor Luxcraft.

11:11.630 --> 11:12.965
And who's this now?

11:13.048 --> 11:14.842
Smells awfully suspicious.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.970
He's new.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.388
Strange name, "New."

11:19.471 --> 11:23.141
I knew a Newt once.I think he owes me a sandwich.

11:23.851 --> 11:29.147
That blaggard thought I'd forget about it.Well, I won't have it. I want my sandwich!

11:29.731 --> 11:33.193
No, sir. He's a new student.

11:33.277 --> 11:38.073
His name is Wolf... boy.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.492
Wolfboy. His name is Wolfboy.

11:42.786 --> 11:45.330
A new student, eh?

11:48.959 --> 11:50.752
Well, well, well.

11:54.882 --> 11:58.510
Run along now, little sprytelings,or you'll be late for class.

11:58.594 --> 12:01.305
And if you do happen to bump into Newt,

12:01.388 --> 12:06.393
you tell him he better butter up,because I'm coming for my sandwich.

12:11.315 --> 12:12.316
Sandwich!

12:17.362 --> 12:19.865
So you were a spryte all along.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.034
No, Sprout. He's still--

12:22.117 --> 12:24.786
I was just... Never mind.

12:24.870 --> 12:29.374
Right, human. You'll have to cometo the Cloud Lab with us. But lay low.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.044
Then we'll figure outhow to get rid of you.

12:35.380 --> 12:40.719
Remember, class, this is one of the mostimportant zones in the factory.

12:40.802 --> 12:45.349
Every element of the world's weatheris made in the labs here

12:45.432 --> 12:48.435
and then shipped up to the surface.

12:48.519 --> 12:53.398
Snow, sunshine, wind, rain. All of it.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.611
Where did he go?

12:59.530 --> 13:01.073
Are those clouds?

13:01.156 --> 13:04.535
If you're referringto the cloud-shaped, cloudlike clouds,

13:05.118 --> 13:08.455
then yes, those are indeed clouds.

13:08.539 --> 13:10.541
Now, follow me, everyone.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.544
Why are they inside?

13:13.627 --> 13:16.505
You know, for someone who'strying to lay low,

13:16.588 --> 13:18.632
you're talking an awful lot.

13:26.515 --> 13:30.060
All clouds start off smalland white and fluffy,

13:30.143 --> 13:32.771
just like the baby cloudsyou've been looking after.

13:34.648 --> 13:38.360
But when they get older,clouds can become very emotional.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.696
It's our job to keep them happy.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.492
But no cloud is happy all the time.

13:46.076 --> 13:49.913
Sometimes clouds get sadand become rain clouds.

13:50.747 --> 13:55.169
And sometimes they get angryand become storm clouds.

13:57.588 --> 14:01.383
But these emotions are all partof the balance of things.

14:02.092 --> 14:05.387
After all, the world needs rain clouds.

14:07.764 --> 14:12.019
Okay, everyone, your assignment wasto look after your cloudlings

14:12.102 --> 14:14.062
and prepare them for the surface.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.565
Let's see how you got on.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.151
Okay, Floof. Ready?

14:19.234 --> 14:22.154
Now you can go up thereand be a cloud for real.

14:24.865 --> 14:28.493
Just be yourself. Make us proud, okay?

14:34.291 --> 14:37.419
They grow up so fast.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.601
Beautiful.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.978
Oh, yes.

15:24.383 --> 15:26.051
Where are they taking Floof?

15:26.134 --> 15:30.472
Maybe there's a special placefor extra cute clouds?

15:30.556 --> 15:34.810
Okay, all of the clouds over hereare ready for the human realm.

15:34.893 --> 15:38.480
-Well done, sprytelings.-What about Floof?

15:38.564 --> 15:40.399
I'm afraid this cloud is--

15:40.482 --> 15:45.529
Well, it wouldn't quite fit in up there.It's a little too odd.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.533
But that's a good thing.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.705
Floof?

16:43.045 --> 16:46.548
Stay calm. Everyone, follow me.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.469
Everyone here? Oh, my goodness!

16:53.430 --> 16:57.893
We can't leave now.This just got interesting. Right, Sprout?

16:58.602 --> 16:59.937
Sprout?

17:00.020 --> 17:04.650
Maybe if we just keep really quiet,he'll tucker himself out.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.736
No way. I'm gonna have to getin there and sort this out.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.656
Human, you stay back. I'll handle this.

17:10.739 --> 17:12.449
But I can help.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.952
What's your power?

17:15.035 --> 17:19.205
He doesn't have one, Sprout.For the last time, he's not a spryte.

17:23.335 --> 17:27.214
No powers, eh? How about this!

17:27.297 --> 17:30.175
Wow! Is that a shield?

17:52.698 --> 17:56.285
It's not working!You're just making him angrier!

18:03.250 --> 18:05.085
I told you to stay back!

18:29.109 --> 18:32.070
I have an idea, but I need to get closer.

18:32.154 --> 18:37.075
-Closer? Why?-I think Floof's just upset.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.827
I get like that sometimes.

18:38.911 --> 18:41.830
You turn into a massive,lightning-filled cloud monster?

18:41.914 --> 18:44.041
Kind of. On the inside.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.710
And what would you suggestwe do about that?

18:46.793 --> 18:50.214
-Sprout, those vine-y thingies.-Where?

18:50.297 --> 18:53.258
-No, I mean the things in your---These old things?

18:53.342 --> 18:56.136
Yeah! Do you thinkyou can get me up there?

18:56.220 --> 18:57.596
So I can talk to him.

18:59.014 --> 19:00.432
I can try.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.435
-Ready?-Ready.

19:17.241 --> 19:19.493
Floof. Floof, it's me.

19:19.576 --> 19:22.371
Hey, listen. It's going to be okay.

19:24.706 --> 19:28.210
I know things seem bad.You feel like you don't fit in,

19:28.293 --> 19:32.256
and you feel like nobody likes you,and you don't really know why.

19:32.339 --> 19:35.759
Then your head gets all messylike spaghetti and fireworks.

19:35.843 --> 19:37.970
I get like that sometimes too.

19:38.053 --> 19:41.056
But you know whatalways makes me feel better?

19:42.307 --> 19:43.475
A hug.

19:44.643 --> 19:47.396
Would that be okay, if we tried that?

19:56.738 --> 19:59.074
He must be a great hugger.

20:19.970 --> 20:24.141
Look at what that cloud of yours has done.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.768
-Where is it?-Cloud? Was there a cloud?

20:26.852 --> 20:30.939
-I didn't see any cloud.-What exactly do you mean by "cloud"?

20:31.523 --> 20:35.444
Luxcraft would like to see youin his office. Now.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.112
Oh, crumbs.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.125
Wow.

20:56.882 --> 20:59.551
-A hug?-Pardon me?

20:59.635 --> 21:02.846
You calmed down that storm cloudwith a hug?

21:03.555 --> 21:04.598
Yes.

21:12.231 --> 21:14.566
Why, that's brilliant!

21:15.859 --> 21:17.945
Now, about this human.

21:18.779 --> 21:21.615
We're sorry.We'll take him back right away.

21:21.698 --> 21:23.825
Wait. I don't want to go back.

21:23.909 --> 21:26.703
I don't fit in up there.

21:26.787 --> 21:29.581
They all think I'm weird.

21:29.665 --> 21:31.959
What does that matter?

21:32.042 --> 21:36.713
Why, it's the oddballs like you,the ones who don't fit in,

21:36.797 --> 21:41.260
they're the ones who make a difference,who change the world for the better.

21:41.343 --> 21:44.012
You just have to find your place up there.

21:44.096 --> 21:47.516
But what if my place is here with you?

21:47.599 --> 21:51.061
Humans belong in the human realm.The clue is in the name.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.940
But he's not a human. He's a spryte.

21:55.023 --> 21:59.111
Humans can't see sprytes,but he can see me and you.

21:59.194 --> 22:00.696
How do you explain that?

22:01.280 --> 22:03.031
How indeed?

22:08.161 --> 22:10.038
And he glows.

22:10.122 --> 22:11.957
-What?-Yeah, what?

22:12.040 --> 22:16.461
Humans aren't supposed to glow,but he glows sometimes. I've seen him.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.756
Glows, does he? That's odd.

22:20.299 --> 22:22.634
I wonder.

22:23.218 --> 22:26.513
Perhaps there's more to youthan meets the eye.

22:27.055 --> 22:30.142
So I can stay?

22:30.225 --> 22:31.643
You may stay.

22:31.727 --> 22:34.479
-Hooray!-For a little while at least.

22:34.563 --> 22:36.106
What? Why?

22:36.190 --> 22:37.191
I'm not sure yet.

22:37.274 --> 22:41.069
But there's something about him.I can feel it tickling my beard.

22:41.153 --> 22:43.030
I need some time to think.

22:45.991 --> 22:47.576
There is one condition.

22:47.659 --> 22:48.994
Yes. Anything.

22:49.077 --> 22:52.414
Humans aren't supposed to knowabout the spryte realm,

22:52.497 --> 22:55.334
let alone be wanderingthe corridors willy-nilly.

22:55.417 --> 22:58.378
If word spread that a humanwas down here, well...

22:59.338 --> 23:03.884
Let's just keep that mask onand keep all this human business quiet

23:03.967 --> 23:08.055
until I can figure out whatto do with you, okay?

23:09.264 --> 23:10.682
Okay.

23:11.475 --> 23:13.560
Mum was right all along.

23:13.644 --> 23:16.980
This is so adventure-y!

23:17.064 --> 23:18.565
Hooray!

23:19.191 --> 23:20.359
Hooray.
