     (eerie dramatic music)

00:16.350 --> 00:18.017
          - Oh my god!

00:18.019 --> 00:18.751
           (gunshot)

00:18.753 --> 00:21.286
           (screaming)

00:24.091 --> 00:26.425
     (eerie dramatic music)

00:26.427 --> 00:30.095
    - [Narrator] 10% of all
hoarding cases involve extremely

00:30.097 --> 00:31.363
       haunted properties.

00:31.365 --> 00:35.434
        Rockford, Ohio,
       March 19th, 2017.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.770
       A group of reality
      show experts set out

00:37.772 --> 00:40.773
    to reform a hoarder with
    several condemned homes.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.710
        This is how the
    ultimately reality show

00:44.712 --> 00:47.112
turned into a deadly nightmare.

00:48.249 --> 00:51.517
     (eerie dramatic music)

00:55.389 --> 00:57.423
     - Welcome to Extremely
        Haunted Hoarders.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.593
       - We're gonna make
      reality show history.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.798
    - And we have made quite
    the alarming discovery.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.502
      - This is disgusting.

01:10.504 --> 01:13.605
      - I've never seen so
      much shit in my life.

01:13.607 --> 01:17.376
     - This has been a big
   job but I'm not done yet.

01:17.378 --> 01:20.079
   - You're gonna clean this
   fucking shit up right now

01:20.081 --> 01:21.780
    or you're going to jail.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.749
        - Die you fuck!

01:23.751 --> 01:26.285
           (screaming)

01:27.555 --> 01:29.154
 - So we have 48 hours to
  bring this place up to code.

01:29.156 --> 01:30.289
        One, two, three.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.291
       Let's get to work.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.693
      - [Narrator] This is
   Extremely Haunted Hoarders.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.565
    Rockford, Ohio was once
      a booming Lake Eerie

01:39.567 --> 01:41.166
          shipping hub.

01:41.168 --> 01:44.503
   Where the industrial East
    met the sprawling West.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.439
     Nowadays, Rockford has
     fallen on rough times.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.175
     Addiction and hoarding
         are prevalent.

01:50.177 --> 01:52.811
    - Rockford, Ohio used to
   be just such a great place.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.713
     It slid, its way down.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.049
      Just a fucking dump.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.384
  - Crime rates are high, lots
    of drug use, crack heads.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.687
     - People are up to move
  somewhere else to find a job.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.654
       - I love this town.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.556
There's a lot to do, there's uh,

02:04.558 --> 02:07.126
   lot of chicks in this town
     and I fucking love it.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.261
    - I think Donald Trumps
   gonna make Rockford, Ohio

02:09.263 --> 02:10.529
          great again.

02:10.530 --> 02:11.796
      - We got three basic
    problems in this place.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.866
   Number on, property values.

02:13.868 --> 02:15.868
    Number two, drug abuse.

02:15.870 --> 02:18.137
    Very very bad drug abuse

02:18.139 --> 02:19.671
        and number three
        is the hoarding.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.607
       - I know a couple
       of hoarders, yes.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.343
       - Everybody in this
       town is a hoarder.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.679
   - We have the most hoarders
      per capita in the US.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.749
       (tense eerie music)

02:32.853 --> 02:35.220
      - [Narrator] Sheila
    Smyth and Dr. Lance Ebe

02:35.222 --> 02:38.223
  have been reforming hoarders
      across the Rust Belt

02:38.225 --> 02:39.892
   for the last three years.

02:39.894 --> 02:41.460
     - Welcome to Rockford.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.162
          - [Narrator]
    Showrunner Sheila Smyth

02:43.164 --> 02:45.564
         has rejuvenated
       hundreds of hoards.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.432
  - Hi, my name is Sheila Smyth

02:47.434 --> 02:48.634
and I'm a professional organizer

02:48.635 --> 02:49.835
          and interior
      designer specializing

02:49.837 --> 02:51.303
    in hoarder decluttering.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.572
      - Dr. Ebe's patients
       have a relapse rate

02:53.574 --> 02:55.674
            of 94%.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.775
    - In a peculiar way, the
  patient that we are treating

02:57.778 --> 02:59.778
  is actually the entire town.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.647
       - Alright, its time
        to meet our guy.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.348
 - [Narrator] Meet Murph Evans.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.785
     75 years old, born and
       raised in Rockford.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.821
          - Breakfast?

03:08.822 --> 03:10.856
     Oh well, I had chicken
      liver for breakfast.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.926
      That's a delicacy if
       you cook it right.

03:13.928 --> 03:16.328
       Chicken livers are
        ripe for giving.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.364
  I get it when its on 50% off.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.734
          I got to get
     everything at 50% off.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.204
         I'm a 50% man.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.872
    - [Narrator] Murph Evans
      has been collecting

03:26.874 --> 03:28.941
      antique furniture and
      cluttering properties

03:28.943 --> 03:30.943
     for the last 50 years.

03:30.945 --> 03:34.213
        - This room here
       looks pretty bad,

03:34.215 --> 03:35.998
   looks like a lot of stuff.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.782
      There's art, all of
    great importance in here

03:37.785 --> 03:40.619
 but there are some nice things

03:40.621 --> 03:43.488
     if you, if you search.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.923
       - [Narrator] Every
   Sunday, the town convenes

03:44.925 --> 03:48.627
   at the Rockford auction and
    Murph Evans is a regular.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.629
  This is catnip for hoarders.

03:50.631 --> 03:53.265
   - When you go in, you don't
  know what you're gonna find.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.567
    The element of surprise
      that makes auctions

03:55.569 --> 03:56.568
          so much fun.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.304
- I believe that the entire town

03:59.306 --> 04:02.307
  is suffering and is culpable

04:02.309 --> 04:04.309
to some degree, in this illness

04:04.311 --> 04:05.577
  and will have to be treated.

04:05.579 --> 04:09.248
   It is disorder writ large.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.250
     - Sold for $300 there.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.584
      Number 110 to buy it.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.919
           Number 110.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.787
       - Oh that shotgun
        at the auction.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.988
        That's a beauty.

04:16.991 --> 04:18.557
    That's a real treasure.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.692
       That's a real wall
       hanger, that one.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.595
     Piece at a time, piece
     at time from auctions,

04:23.597 --> 04:24.796
        that's for sure.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.602
       (soft tense music)

04:32.539 --> 04:34.006
       - [Narrator] Murph
       Evans owns at least

04:34.008 --> 04:35.607
   three condemned properties,
        that we know of.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.876
Named after their former owners.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.811
    - Nobody in the history
      of reality programs

04:39.813 --> 04:42.014
   has ever tackled a hoarder
     with three properties.

04:42.016 --> 04:45.550
    - [Narrator] The gothic
    and forlorn Lemon house.

04:45.552 --> 04:48.820
       The Manjuris house,
  Victorian haunt on the hill.

04:48.822 --> 04:52.357
    The Neiland farmhouse, a
   former cauliflower ranch.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.893
       - Murph Evans is a
       phenomenal hoarder.

04:54.895 --> 04:58.730
     Every time he acquires
something and runs out of space,

04:58.732 --> 05:01.967
         he goes out and
       finds another house

05:01.969 --> 05:03.502
   and this is extraordinary,

05:03.504 --> 05:06.772
   this is a highly evolved,
      very aggressive form

05:06.774 --> 05:07.739
          of hoarding.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.574
  It appears to have ambition.

05:09.576 --> 05:10.842
   - You get so many chairs,

05:10.844 --> 05:12.511
  you sometimes, gotta buy four

05:12.513 --> 05:13.912
    to get the one you want.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.982
    - Typically the hoarder
    will stay in one place,

05:16.984 --> 05:19.851
     like a nest, and cover
      themselves in filth.

05:19.853 --> 05:23.388
     In Murph's case, there
      are satellite nests.

05:23.390 --> 05:26.758
   There is almost an entity
   that needs to be satisfied

05:26.760 --> 05:29.628
    in spite of what I call
      a typical hoarder's,

05:29.630 --> 05:32.064
       you know, behavior,
      which is to be inert,

05:32.066 --> 05:34.032
 stationary, and filth covered.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.401
     In Murph's case, he's
    out going from property

05:36.403 --> 05:38.603
     to property, auctions,
      all sorts of things,

05:38.605 --> 05:41.873
   acquiring these pointless
     pieces of shit, really

05:41.875 --> 05:44.743
       and then farming it
     out to different homes

05:44.745 --> 05:46.345
and this is why I think the town

05:46.347 --> 05:47.546
    is in fact the patient,

05:47.548 --> 05:49.748
       it is in danger of
        being taken over

05:49.750 --> 05:52.351
  by a viral hoarding disorder.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.087
- He cannot let go of anything.

05:55.089 --> 05:55.954
       - Its a sickness.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.357
    - The place is a pigsty.

05:58.359 --> 05:59.658
      The man is an animal.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.961
       - Time does run out
      and energy runs out.

06:02.963 --> 06:06.031
       (tense eerie music)

06:08.902 --> 06:11.903
    - So either you smarten
   up and clean this shit up

06:11.905 --> 06:14.439
   or we're coming back here,
   we're condemning the place,

06:14.441 --> 06:15.774
  you lose everything, alright.

06:15.776 --> 06:16.975
          You got that?

06:16.977 --> 06:18.577
      - Yes, I worry about
       my teams, for sure.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.512
        I mean we'll all
       be crawling through

06:20.514 --> 06:21.680
       a twisted mans mind

06:21.682 --> 06:22.981
        and that can get
       pretty dangerous.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.050
       - Yeah I think all
        this reality TV

06:25.052 --> 06:26.585
  is just a bunch of bullshit.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.588
Its just all staged and made up

06:29.590 --> 06:33.859
   just to entertain the idle
    people with idle minds.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.127
      - [Narrator] With the
      clock ticking before

06:35.129 --> 06:36.728
      he loses everything,

06:36.730 --> 06:38.663
       Murph Evans agrees
        to open his door

06:38.665 --> 06:40.832
       to our experts in
        a desperate bid

06:40.834 --> 06:42.467
    to save his properties.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.806
      The contractor team
    has arrived in Rockford

06:47.808 --> 06:50.475
 to stock up for the job ahead.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.144
    - Grab some of those knee
   pads, you're gonna need em.

06:52.146 --> 06:53.879
       - [Narrator] Derek
       Jago and the Falcon

06:53.881 --> 06:55.947
      and Toledo's greatest
         house flippers.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.550
      - Company I represent
     is the Duke of Hazard.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.951
        That's why they
       call me the Duke.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.421
    Mostly I roll around with
   a guy they call the Falcon.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.823
         - Name is Tony
     Fennick, 34 years old.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.625
     Yeah I've been working
       with jack off here

07:06.627 --> 07:07.592
      for about five years.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.628
  - He's a little yappy but uh,

07:09.630 --> 07:10.829
 that's what ear plugs are for.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.497
         - Promises me a
      promotion every time

07:12.499 --> 07:13.765
        but I doubt it.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.100
        By the looks of
       it, I don't know,

07:15.102 --> 07:17.569
      between us, I think
    he's kind of losing it.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.938
  He's not so mentally stable.

07:22.443 --> 07:23.742
         What the fuck?

07:23.744 --> 07:24.609
        See what I mean?

07:24.611 --> 07:26.044
       - That work for ya?

07:26.046 --> 07:28.146
   - I would compare Duke to
   being like a sledgehammer

07:28.148 --> 07:30.715
   and I'm more like a chisel.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.050
      - Hey come on, I know
      they don't got those

07:32.052 --> 07:33.518
       in El Salvador but
        we got em here.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.787
       - So I'm Maltese,
       very proud of it.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.856
     Most people don't even
      know where Malta is.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.858
     - What nationality do
    it think the Falcon is?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.193
      Do you accept pesos?

07:41.195 --> 07:42.461
          I don't know.

07:42.463 --> 07:43.462
            Korean?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.462
       Try to keep those
    little legs up to speed,

07:44.465 --> 07:45.630
           okay chief?

07:45.632 --> 07:47.132
        I take shitholes
      and make em livable.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.066
       That's a nightmare.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.601
   I'm the best at what I do.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.736
      If you get the Duke,
   you're getting perfection.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.207
    - [Narrator] With three
       homes to clean up,

07:55.209 --> 07:58.477
      the contractors must
   recruit a local day worker.

08:00.214 --> 08:01.880
          - Holy fuck.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.782
     Welcome to the jungle.

08:03.784 --> 08:04.716
         - My last job?

08:05.919 --> 08:07.219
      This is my last job.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.821
    My name is Charles Ivey.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.757
  I'm born and raised Rockford.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.192
       - You, come here.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.027
            No, no.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.095
      You, you want a job?

08:17.097 --> 08:17.963
           Yes I do.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.498
           - Get in.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.966
           - Alright.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.834
 - You're missing the beauties.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.970
       - [Man] Don't know
      what you're missing.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.572
          - (mumbles).

08:29.109 --> 08:31.776
          (eerie music)

08:36.683 --> 08:38.917
   - How can we be sure that
    this is a haunted hoard?

08:38.919 --> 08:41.720
   Well we can't be sure until
    we get the team in there

08:41.722 --> 08:43.337
       processing the site

08:43.339 --> 08:44.955
       but in Murph Evans
    case, we know for a fact

08:44.958 --> 08:47.058
       that several of the
  properties that he purchased

08:47.060 --> 08:48.660
   were documented hot zones.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.861
       - [Narrator] Caleb
        and Chloe Black

08:49.863 --> 08:52.664
      are Northern Ohio's
    most renowned paranormal

08:52.666 --> 08:53.832
         ghost hunters.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.200
       - I dabble in ESP.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.870
   Astroplanes, precog, truly
     connecting to spirits.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.006
 Caleb here, he's the tech guy.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.941
         - Our outfit in
       nocturnal frequency

09:02.943 --> 09:05.277
      has been going strong
       for five years now.

09:05.279 --> 09:07.212
       We've been looking
     for our time to shine.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.214
       We've been building
        up the Instagram.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.749
    Working on the YouTube.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.285
        Rockford is the
    epicenter of something.

09:13.287 --> 09:16.621
   - There are so many tainted
     and scary spirits here.

09:16.623 --> 09:18.023
     - This place is alive.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.558
   You name it, we've seen it.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.960
      We got the Zanesville
          lobster boy.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.763
   Made a nine hour web series
     out of that encounter.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.231
     The Akron chill event.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.699
     Eighty degrees outside

09:27.701 --> 09:29.734
       except for this one
     particular park bench,

09:29.736 --> 09:32.637
 sit down, freeze your ass off.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.239
       The Paducah angel.

09:34.241 --> 09:38.043
      First recorded entity
        that is bisexual.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.911
      It was a rough patch
        for Chloe and I.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.079
     - We are now divorced.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.149
        - So we're lucky
       enough to be here

09:44.151 --> 09:45.016
 with one of Rockford's finest.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.251
     Bylaw Officer Chapman.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.053
    So can you tell me what
     would happen if Murph

09:48.055 --> 09:50.288
       can't get his homes
       up to code in time?

09:50.290 --> 09:52.057
       - Well he'll lose
    everything for starters.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.326
        All his shit, his
       homes, his dignity.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.194
  Regional township of Rockford

09:56.196 --> 09:59.164
     grants me the power to
   condemn any hoarded houses

09:59.166 --> 10:01.800
 within 60 days of a violation.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.868
       Sadly, Murph Evans
        has 20 of those.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.271
    So I'm just waiting for
   the court order to come in

10:06.273 --> 10:09.074
     before the township can
  confiscate these properties.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.145
       - So on day one we
     like to dive right in.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.747
      What's it gonna take
      to clear these places

10:15.749 --> 10:17.816
     and to be honest with
   you, is it even possible?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.084
       Each of our teams
       have been assigned

10:19.086 --> 10:20.652
       a house to inspect.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.287
      I personally will be
   inspecting the farm house

10:22.289 --> 10:23.888
  with Dr. Ebe and Murph Evans.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.625
       - So you found the
        Neiland's house.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.360
 This is the oldest one of all.

10:28.362 --> 10:30.929
      It was built in 1869.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.632
   Its almost an Antebellum.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.634
   - Oh sorry, you scared me.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.035
          Murph Evans?
             - Yeah.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.837
    - I'm Sheila, I spoke to
   you on the phone last week.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.172
  - I thought there'd be 10 of
      youse coming today.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.374
   - Well its just for me now.

10:42.376 --> 10:43.975
 - Well you can't get in there.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.176
     There's a whole bunch
    of shit piled in there,

10:45.178 --> 10:46.778
so you'll have to come this way.

10:46.780 --> 10:47.979
            - Okay.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.648
       - If you'd given me
       a bit of time here,

10:49.650 --> 10:52.050
   I could of had some of this
  stuff piled up a bit neater,

10:52.052 --> 10:53.985
          but, however.
         - That's okay.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.153
     - Can't change it now.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.390
     - It was a very unique
        experience for me

10:58.392 --> 11:00.392
   inspecting the farmhouse.

11:00.394 --> 11:04.062
       I have never felt
       this sense of fear

11:04.064 --> 11:05.263
   anywhere I've been before.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.132
   - Come onto this room here.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.800
      Have a look at this.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.803
   - It just has this really
   negative energy about it.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.271
             Oh my.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.906
   I can barely walk in here.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.845
    It's oppressive clutter.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.148
   I have seen the worst and
     this is the first time

11:23.150 --> 11:25.817
     I have felt personally
      threatened by trash.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.218
   This is gonna be a bigger
      job than I thought.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.121
    - Well no, a lot of the
   stuff I'm not as attached

11:30.123 --> 11:31.423
 to as they're making out I am.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.992
       - So you have a lot
       of picture frames.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.360
        - Oh yeah, I got
      some good ones here.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.362
         - And a lot of
      these old portraits,

11:37.364 --> 11:40.365
   you can tell they propped
    them up after they died

11:40.367 --> 11:41.966
      and took the picture.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.902
       A lot of it is just
      sitting there waiting

11:43.904 --> 11:46.705
maybe to find like a mate for it

11:46.707 --> 11:48.740
       to make up a set or
       something like that

11:48.742 --> 11:50.709
   and it may never get used

11:50.711 --> 11:53.445
      it may always be an
   orphan just sitting there

11:53.447 --> 11:56.047
         waiting to find
       another one like it

11:56.049 --> 11:58.750
   or the proper place for it.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.719
        - And so do you
       think there's any,

12:00.721 --> 12:02.721
       any way you could
        get rid of a few

12:02.723 --> 12:04.122
       and just keep some
       of your favorites?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.124
     - Well I want to match
   them up for pairs and that

12:06.126 --> 12:08.426
       before I even think
   of getting rid of anything.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.462
 See what you can get for pairs

12:10.464 --> 12:12.197
         and maybe there
     wouldn't be many left.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.466
  - Do you think its necessary
      to keep all of them?

12:14.468 --> 12:15.867
     - Pairs are important.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.670
            - Right.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.204
        - Some things I'm
      terribly attached to,

12:20.207 --> 12:24.008
   other things are just kinda
    sitting there in waiting.

12:24.010 --> 12:24.876
       - Who's this guy?

12:24.878 --> 12:26.161
       - Who's that guy?

12:26.162 --> 12:27.445
      Oh that's the cutest
       little teddy bear.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.147
       I don't know where
       it ever came from

12:29.149 --> 12:30.915
        but its so well
       done, the little,

12:30.917 --> 12:34.285
    the little, uh, leather
        pads on the paws

12:34.287 --> 12:35.954
   and that are just so cute.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.222
        - Oh it is cute.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.156
      Is this one a keeper?

12:38.158 --> 12:39.224
     - Well I'll keep sure.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.059
             - Yeah?
          - He's cute.

12:41.061 --> 12:44.162
He's passed the test, he's cute.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.797
            (laughs)

12:45.799 --> 12:48.500
       Everything's cute
        that's in here.

12:48.502 --> 12:51.302
  It doesn't matter what it is.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.105
   Just a room of treasures.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.808
      - And you don't, you
   don't feel like you could

12:56.810 --> 12:58.777
     let go of any of them?

12:58.779 --> 13:00.245
   - No, no not many anyway.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.547
     I'd have to be pretty,

13:02.548 --> 13:04.848
     it have to be a pretty
        good day for me,

13:04.851 --> 13:06.317
       cause I said, I do
       want to get pairs

13:06.319 --> 13:07.986
   and things all matched up

13:07.988 --> 13:11.322
      and I just, sometimes
       I said there's lots

13:11.324 --> 13:12.791
   that will never get hung up

13:12.793 --> 13:15.293
    but pairs are important.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.963
      - [Narrator] Dr. Ebe
   peels into two hours late

13:18.965 --> 13:19.931
       to the farmhouse.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.202
       - Its all about the
       clock, Ebe therapy.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.204
        Its crunch time.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.407
     I don't got, you know,
    a year to work on a guy

13:29.409 --> 13:33.812
      with talk therapy or
      pharmacological cures

13:33.814 --> 13:34.546
     none of that bullshit.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.247
 This is like, I got 10 minutes

13:36.249 --> 13:37.282
      to turn this around.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.249
  I just look at him like that.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.818
   Look him right in the eye.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.386
      I tell him, we don't
   have time to fuck around.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.021
- This space we're in right now,

13:43.023 --> 13:44.389
       what is your plan?

13:44.391 --> 13:47.091
     - Well, get rid of some
      of the lesser pieces

13:47.093 --> 13:48.426
  and then the real good stuff,

13:48.428 --> 13:50.128
Ross is gonna help me carry them

13:50.130 --> 13:51.496
     up to the third floor.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.232
      Who's that, I wonder?

13:54.234 --> 13:55.967
   - Oh that will be Dr. Ebe.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.252
   - How is he gonna get in?

13:57.253 --> 13:58.536
       - Well I'll go and
     get him from the back.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.971
   - Maybe I can get through.

13:59.973 --> 14:00.905
         Just a minute.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.440
 Just maybe we can manage this.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.043
       See what we can do.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.478
             There.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.912
   - Well I can't wait for you
   to meet our doctor, Murph.

14:07.914 --> 14:10.014
        - I don't need a
    doctor, I need somebody

14:10.016 --> 14:13.585
     to help me carry stuff
     up to the third floor.

14:13.587 --> 14:17.088
     (dramatic eerie music)

14:22.028 --> 14:23.294
         - Murph Evans?

14:23.296 --> 14:24.362
            Dr. Ebe.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.470
   Get in here at all, is it?

14:32.472 --> 14:34.172
              Okay.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.039
     Sheila, how you doing?

14:35.041 --> 14:35.940
           - I'm well.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.609
    - Jesus quick, help me.

14:37.611 --> 14:38.543
            Help me.

14:42.616 --> 14:44.582
         Show me around
       this goddamn place.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.285
    - Okay, come on upstairs.

14:48.588 --> 14:51.089
    - The Neiland farmhouse
   was a very curious place.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.157
    It was very hard to move
     around in that house.

14:53.159 --> 14:58.229
      It's clearly a maze
        and a impossible
    frustrating environment.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.100
    Just didn't really look
     like a hoarder house.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.168
        It looked like a
       warehouse, frankly,

15:04.170 --> 15:08.239
  of furniture that was stacked
    in them most curious way.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.376
         Mostly it had
    headboards and settees,

15:11.378 --> 15:12.477
    a new word I just heard,

15:12.479 --> 15:14.045
   bureaus, things like that

15:14.047 --> 15:17.048
        and he knew the
    provenance of each one.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.217
       - That's the base
        of a Davenport.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.319
       That's a seven foot
         double pedestal

15:21.321 --> 15:23.922
  Mahogany Georgian sideboard.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.957
 This is your John Hall Empire.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.225
   This is another Heinzman,

15:27.227 --> 15:29.460
       see there you are,
        Gerard Heinzman.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.396
   - I don't know where we're
     gonna start with this.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.332
    - [Narrator] Even Sheila
Smyth, a seasoned professional,

15:34.334 --> 15:35.600
        is apprehensive.

15:35.602 --> 15:39.203
        She can feel the
    despair within the walls

15:39.205 --> 15:41.573
       of Neiland house.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.942
      - Nobody's died here
      since I can remember

15:43.944 --> 15:48.279
       but I'm quite sure
     that back in the 1800s

15:48.281 --> 15:50.415
     when everybody died at
     home with the neighbor

15:50.417 --> 15:53.351
     helping to do whatever
         they had to do

15:53.353 --> 15:58.423
    that there probably has
     been people die here.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.625
          (tense music)

16:00.627 --> 16:02.026
      - The spirit workers
      get their first look

16:02.028 --> 16:04.262
       at the Lemon house.

16:04.264 --> 16:07.031
       They have the most
    challenging task of all.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.968
The removal of unwanted guests.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.504
      - Mrs. Lemon was sick
        here for the last

16:13.506 --> 16:15.173
        many many years.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.641
      She'd be sitting out
        on the porch here

16:16.643 --> 16:19.043
 with all her oxygen goodies on

16:19.045 --> 16:21.179
  so she lived to be quite old

16:21.181 --> 16:24.048
    but I don't know whether
    anyone died here or not.

16:24.050 --> 16:28.052
    You'd have to, I guess,
      have a ghost machine

16:28.054 --> 16:31.589
        or something to
       find that one out.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.457
- Alright, infrared thermometer?

16:32.459 --> 16:33.524
           - Got it.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.559
       - Voice recorder?
             - Yep.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.060
           - UV light?
          - Roger that.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.195
         - Flash light?
            - Got it.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.129
         - Blue prints?
            - Check.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.130
          - Laser grid?
            - Roger.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.231
           - Lighter?
            - check.

16:40.232 --> 16:41.331
        - First aid kit?
         - Affirmative.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.134
         - EVP decoder?
       - That's a big yes.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.602
   - Night vision head gear?
        - Got that, too.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.170
          - Batteries?
              - No.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.338
         - Light meter.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.474
      - Check, check, check
        yes, got it, yes.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.209
   - Right, looks like we have
    everything we need here.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.278
  - No we're missing something.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.546
      Something important.

16:58.485 --> 17:01.019
        THC incinerator.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.186
            Kaboom.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.088
        - When we arrived
       to the Lemon house,

17:04.089 --> 17:05.690
       it was a disaster.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.759
   I mean clutter everywhere.

17:07.761 --> 17:11.029
 The entire house had this vibe

17:11.031 --> 17:12.763
   of depression and sadness

17:12.766 --> 17:15.500
    and something definitely
      had a hold over it.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.436
          - Hey Chloe.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.140
        Setting up here.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.310
 - [Narrator] Murph Evans
   has crammed the Lemon house

17:26.311 --> 17:30.515
   with his bursting inventory
      of antique furniture.

17:30.517 --> 17:34.052
      - You can definitely
    feel something in here.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.253
          - [Narrator]
      Psychic, Chloe Black,

17:35.255 --> 17:37.522
        has isolated an
       ominous vibration

17:37.524 --> 17:39.657
 in the first floor parlor room

17:39.659 --> 17:43.461
that was the sight of a botched
    suicide attempt in 1908.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.199
          - Hey Chloe!

17:48.201 --> 17:50.101
           (screams)

17:50.103 --> 17:51.069
            - Shit.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.203
   - Oh those ghost hunters.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.938
    They're stupid as hell.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.672
   They're running around with
   them battery charger things

17:55.675 --> 17:58.342
         roped onto them
       and they don't know

17:58.344 --> 18:00.078
        their ass from a
       hole in the ground.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.146
 They are really really stupid.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.684
        (tape rewinding)

18:11.357 --> 18:12.690
    - [Ghostly Voice] Hello.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.526
   - All our scopes, meters,
     dials, and doo hickies

18:15.528 --> 18:17.762
 were just going off the radar.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.130
           (beeping)

18:19.132 --> 18:20.631
       I didn't know what
        to think of it.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.768
           Hey, Chloe!

18:25.105 --> 18:27.438
          Where you at?

18:27.440 --> 18:30.141
      - You need to set up
       the EMT right away.

18:30.143 --> 18:30.808
            - Where?

18:30.810 --> 18:31.776
           - Upstairs.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.144
  - You want them all entirely?

18:33.146 --> 18:34.378
            (mumbles)
          - Everything.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.781
       We need all hands
       on deck, let's go.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.550
- Right got it, we're doing it.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.152
              Done.

18:41.154 --> 18:45.123
     (upbeat western music)

18:45.125 --> 18:47.592
     - We're standing on the
  porch of the Manjuris house.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.194
 George Manjuris had died in 48

18:50.196 --> 18:53.297
    and there was virtually
      nothing done with it

18:53.299 --> 18:56.567
      til I got it in 2000.

18:56.569 --> 18:57.869
        - [Narrator] The
    contractors have arrived

18:57.871 --> 19:00.338
       to the property to
   determine whether this will

19:00.340 --> 19:02.807
be a tear down or a rental job.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.475
   - Alright, listen up, boys.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.611
    Falcon I'll be watching
        you like a hawk.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.578
      Ivey you let me down,

19:07.580 --> 19:09.547
I'm gonna fuck you up and down.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.617
       - Jago snapped when
        he saw the house.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.820
     - New born baby Jesus,
      this place is a mess.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.556
   Ease drops, non existent.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.725
         Stair raisers,
      completely too small.

19:20.727 --> 19:21.692
              Shit.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.494
Holy fuck, look at the windows.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.695
      Need all new windows.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.364
    - Who's paying for this?

19:26.366 --> 19:27.565
           - Not you.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.900
     Falcon, would you look
       at this foundation?

19:28.902 --> 19:31.836
   It looks like it was built
     in 16 fucking fuck me.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.571
   - You're never done fixing.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.907
       As long as you're
   living, you'll be fixing.

19:35.909 --> 19:41.179
   Something will be falling
      off or rotting away.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.348
   There's always something.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.849
     - [Narrator] Little is
     known about Chuck Ivey

19:44.851 --> 19:47.385
       and his presence on
       set is unsettling.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.321
      - How do I describe
    myself in one sentence?

19:51.391 --> 19:53.224
     I like to help people.

19:53.226 --> 19:56.360
     I love the heavy metal
     music and I love cats.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.263
   I was pretty excited about
     the initial inspection

19:59.265 --> 20:00.198
     of the Manjuris house.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.550
I've walked by it so many times.

20:02.551 --> 20:04.901
 There's, there's so many ghost
  stories and stuff like that.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.871
   - Where the fuck is Ivey?

20:08.675 --> 20:10.508
   So we've just finished with
     the outside inspection,

20:10.510 --> 20:11.842
   now its time to go inside.

20:12.745 --> 20:13.678
          - Its giver.

20:16.249 --> 20:16.981
   What are you laughing at?

20:19.419 --> 20:20.818
- [Narrator] The pressure is on.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.222
    The Duke will have to gut
   and repair three properties

20:24.224 --> 20:26.490
       in just three days.

20:26.492 --> 20:29.560
        - Obviously stage
      five mold over here.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.428
       - Shut up, Falcon.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.796
      That's barely a four.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.564
           (laughing)

20:33.566 --> 20:35.233
       - So the house has
       had quite a career

20:35.235 --> 20:37.568
but inside its totally original.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.503
  It has never been renovated.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.905
   - When I walked in there,

20:40.907 --> 20:43.374
   there was everything from
     ceilings falling down

20:43.376 --> 20:45.676
    to looks like fat ladies
     were having line dance

20:45.678 --> 20:48.646
     lessons on the floors
    and it was just a mess.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.716
     - Definitely knobs and
    tubes gotta be changed.

20:51.718 --> 20:52.917
    Well where do you start?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.319
      Sulfur in the water.

20:55.321 --> 20:57.521
  The walls are falling apart.

20:57.523 --> 20:58.689
           Lead paint.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.458
      If the Manjuris house
        is an indication

21:00.460 --> 21:01.993
       of how the rest of
       this jobs gonna go.

21:01.995 --> 21:05.429
       I think its gonna
        be a tear down.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.265
      Doesn't seem like the
       houses are livable

21:07.267 --> 21:09.300
        as they are now.

21:09.301 --> 21:11.334
     - It's a bit of a maze
       getting through it

21:11.337 --> 21:14.272
       but however, we've
        all done worse.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.806
Oh heres something interesting.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.442
      - First inspection of
       the Manjuris house,

21:18.444 --> 21:19.710
         what a beauty.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.012
  Got water damage right here,

21:21.014 --> 21:22.813
the wall papers out of control.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.015
   More water damage up there.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.450
    We got a broken window.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.884
     I notice that there's
    gonna be a lot more work

21:26.886 --> 21:28.719
    than initially was told.

21:28.721 --> 21:29.954
   That's par for the course.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.689
     Looks like a skunk and
     a raccoon had a fight.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.458
      Yeah we got our work
    cut out for us up here.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.711
     They don't understand,
      the Duke's got a lot

21:36.712 --> 21:38.963
     of work to do and just
    can't pussy fart around

21:38.965 --> 21:40.731
           at any job.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.300
  - This place is creepy, man.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.636
          (eerie notes)

21:46.506 --> 21:47.505
         - Still works.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.843
   - [Narrator] Dr. Ebe sits
     down with Murph Evans,

21:52.845 --> 21:54.979
         to conduct his
       initial assessment.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.315
       - The strategy I'm
       using with Murph,

21:57.317 --> 22:00.051
       is something I call
      intensive short term

22:00.053 --> 22:02.753
   shame based psychotherapy.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.989
        I am interested
       in your feelings.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.857
  For instance, how do you feel

22:06.859 --> 22:10.328
     when you see strangers
         walking around,

22:10.330 --> 22:11.495
       like we are today,

22:11.497 --> 22:14.799
      through your frankly
        disgusting house?

22:14.801 --> 22:17.335
   Tripping over your garbage.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.502
   How does it make you feel?

22:18.504 --> 22:20.538
       - Why, do you find
         me disgusting?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.090
    - To tell you the truth,

22:22.091 --> 22:23.641
      I prefer to ask the
    questions myself, okay.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.676
    - Well fire away, then.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.011
  - I don't have one right now.

22:27.013 --> 22:30.881
      This requires a real
   beating up of the person.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.883
   Bruising that personality,

22:32.885 --> 22:34.852
    making it uncomfortable

22:34.853 --> 22:36.820
       until its banished
   completely from the psyche.

22:36.823 --> 22:37.955
      You know these things
     are getting thrown out

22:37.957 --> 22:39.657
       into a bin, right?

22:39.659 --> 22:42.793
   - I don't need no damn bin,
     I'm not that desperate.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.395
   - The best way to do that

22:44.397 --> 22:45.896
   is to hold up a mirror and
    say, look, this is you.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.565
  The world sees you this way.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.766
   You're a fucking asshole.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.801
   Change right fucking now.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.636
       You get mail here?

22:52.638 --> 22:53.671
     You ever got a letter?

22:53.673 --> 22:54.772
   You ever written a letter?

22:54.774 --> 22:56.674
   You ever opened a letter?

22:56.676 --> 22:57.842
   Huh, from your sweetheart,

22:57.844 --> 22:59.410
      you got a sweetheart?

22:59.412 --> 23:00.544
      I'm not thinking not.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.113
    - Dr. Ebe, he's a mess.

23:02.115 --> 23:04.815
   He's all flubby and cutty

23:04.817 --> 23:06.650
   and he's had the good life

23:06.652 --> 23:09.787
 even though he isn't any good.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.455
       - All this stuff is
     going into a landfill,

23:11.457 --> 23:12.123
         You know that.

23:12.125 --> 23:13.524
       - I don't know why.

23:13.526 --> 23:16.194
Why would you tear down a house

23:16.195 --> 23:18.863
 or throw stuff away just cause
   things need moved or fixed.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.965
    - Mr. Evans, I want you
     to listen to yourself.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.434
There is no running water here.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.669
      There is no plumbing
         in this house.

23:25.671 --> 23:28.072
       There is no heat.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.140
      How do you live here?

23:29.142 --> 23:30.875
      - I don't live here.

23:30.877 --> 23:31.742
            - What?

23:31.744 --> 23:32.743
      - I don't live here.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.879
  Hell no, I'm not that stupid.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.447
 I just use it to store things.

23:36.449 --> 23:37.114
   - Let me get this straight.

23:37.116 --> 23:38.716
      You don't live here?

23:38.718 --> 23:39.583
             - No.
            - What?

23:39.585 --> 23:40.518
              - No.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.620
        - [Ebe] Sheila!

23:42.622 --> 23:43.587
      - Yeah, I'm in here.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.089
 - [Ebe] Word with Ebe, please.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.426
       - What is it, Ebe?

23:48.428 --> 23:50.594
      - You know he doesn't
         even live here.

23:50.596 --> 23:51.595
- What, Murph doesn't live here?

23:51.597 --> 23:52.830
              - No.

23:52.832 --> 23:53.764
       - What do you mean,
       where does he live?

23:53.766 --> 23:54.632
        - I don't know.

23:54.634 --> 23:55.599
            (static)

23:55.601 --> 23:56.467
- Are you gonna crack this guy?

23:56.469 --> 23:57.435
       He seems a little--

23:57.437 --> 23:58.569
  - A little uncomplicated, eh?

23:58.571 --> 23:59.503
      That's what I think.

23:59.505 --> 24:00.704
  He's a little uncomplicated.

24:00.706 --> 24:01.872
       - Yeah I've got to
        get out of here.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.774
        - You know, for a
      guy with hoarder, uh.

24:03.776 --> 24:04.642
            Sheila?

24:04.644 --> 24:05.943
    - Yeah, what is it Ebe?

24:06.913 --> 24:07.912
       - God, I love you.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.920
       - Heres a new one,
      pooper in the pantry.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.789
       - No, no I did not
        put that there.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.058
        I'm not to that
       stage in life yet,

24:21.060 --> 24:24.595
      that I need a shitter
         in the pantry.

24:24.597 --> 24:29.200
     I will have that taken
   out, if I live long enough.

24:29.202 --> 24:32.069
   By the time I take it out,
  probably I will be old enough

24:32.071 --> 24:33.204
           to need it.

24:33.206 --> 24:34.805
       - I have irritable
         bowl syndrome,

24:34.807 --> 24:36.207
          like gut rye.

24:36.209 --> 24:39.510
 Hangs out of you you name it,
    its going on down there.

24:39.512 --> 24:40.478
          Weak stomach.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.480
 I should of told the guys that

24:42.482 --> 24:44.682
  but I think it will be okay.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.883
 - These pipes are looking bad.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.918
   They all need to be redone.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.620
      - Yeah a little PVC.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.555
  At least the furnace is new.

24:51.557 --> 24:53.190
 - At least the furnace is new.

24:53.191 --> 24:54.824
   What are you worried about
 warming your tiny little nuts?

24:56.028 --> 24:58.162
            (groans)

24:59.932 --> 25:02.733
        (dramatic music)

25:03.903 --> 25:06.570
           (farting)
           (groaning)

25:06.572 --> 25:07.505
           - Ah shit.

25:08.508 --> 25:10.841
           (screaming)

25:19.051 --> 25:20.117
     - Ivey, where are you?

25:20.119 --> 25:22.253
      I'm gonna (muffled).

25:22.255 --> 25:23.587
       Get done here now--

25:23.589 --> 25:26.557
          (sputtering)

25:26.559 --> 25:28.926
           (coughing)

25:28.928 --> 25:31.195
           (laughing)

25:32.732 --> 25:34.098
      So when I got blasted
   through the pipe with shit,

25:34.100 --> 25:35.599
         you know, most
      people would fold up

25:35.601 --> 25:37.668
      and leave right there

25:37.670 --> 25:38.602
       but you know what?

25:38.604 --> 25:40.104
 That's not what the Duke does.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.139
       The Duke's had some
     adversity in his life.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.807
   - He deserves what he gets.

25:43.809 --> 25:48.078
     He's just a smart ass,
  doesn't know shit from puddy.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.714
        - So we've just
    finished our inspection

25:50.716 --> 25:52.883
         of the Neiland
    farmhouse and right now,

25:52.885 --> 25:54.752
       I guess we're just
    waiting on you Dr. Ebe.

25:54.754 --> 25:55.886
              - Me?

25:55.888 --> 26:01.091
     Uh, he is an eccentric
       with a blind spot.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.560
        He's doing great
       damage to himself

26:02.562 --> 26:04.128
  and I believe that blind spot

26:04.130 --> 26:06.163
        is pride based.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.699
    Murph, where you going?

26:14.840 --> 26:16.040
           Bullshit.

26:16.042 --> 26:18.309
      - Why, where do you
    think he's really going?

26:18.311 --> 26:19.877
        - I got an idea.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.745
        Let's follow him
        in the Trans Am.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.914
      I took an Ambien, so
      you'll have to drive.

26:23.916 --> 26:24.848
            - Great.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.618
    - [Narrator] Sheila and
      Lance must keep tabs

26:27.620 --> 26:28.986
       on their patient.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.988
There is a high risk of relapse

26:30.990 --> 26:33.290
          at this early
       stage of treatment.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.125
   - Where you going, Murphy.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.860
   There's something us he's
    not telling us, Sheila.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.998
     - Murph told us he was
   heading to the Lemon house

26:41.000 --> 26:44.134
       and as we followed
       him, we discovered

26:44.136 --> 26:45.269
 he was going to Value Village,

26:45.271 --> 26:48.005
         which was quite
      disappointing to me.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.340
             - Why?

26:49.342 --> 26:50.341
           Why, Murph?

26:51.811 --> 26:52.943
       What do you need?

26:52.945 --> 26:55.212
         Some gloves, a
      vase, what the fuck?

26:55.214 --> 26:56.747
You know, you've got everything.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.015
   Wait here, I've got this.

26:58.017 --> 26:58.949
        Okay, just wait.

27:00.653 --> 27:03.020
      - Okay, so I've just
      followed Murph here,

27:03.022 --> 27:05.289
       Dr. Ebe and I and
        not the best way

27:05.291 --> 27:07.224
       to start day one.

27:07.225 --> 27:09.158
    He's obviously in there
     buying some more junk.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.663
   - Watch what you're doing.

27:12.665 --> 27:13.897
             Sorry.

27:13.899 --> 27:16.200
      - [Narrator] Just as
       Dr. Ebe suspected.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.936
   Evan's is in major setback.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.322
     The compulsive subject

27:21.323 --> 27:23.707
     is observed selecting
    random, pointless items.

27:23.709 --> 27:26.176
     Hats, shirts, diapers,
         and baby food.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.186
- Something I can help you with?

27:36.188 --> 27:37.988
   - No I'm good, thank you.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.857
       - I think its time
       that you've left.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.725
         - No I was just
       going, okay thanks.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.194
        Okay, goodnight.

27:44.196 --> 27:45.129
        Yeah, thank you.

27:46.399 --> 27:48.332
       - When they caught
      me at Value Village,

27:48.334 --> 27:50.267
 I didn't feel really anything.

27:50.269 --> 27:53.737
  I know a lot of people there
    and I wasn't buying much.

27:53.739 --> 27:55.806
    Anyway, its my business.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.076
     - [Narrator] The ghost
      hunters must now face

27:59.078 --> 28:00.411
        the Lemon house.

28:00.413 --> 28:03.947
     A legendary portal to
   hell in Rockford folklore.

28:05.685 --> 28:08.152
          (eerie music)

28:10.156 --> 28:12.022
  Chloe is beginning to suspect

28:12.024 --> 28:13.891
         that the Lemon
      house is ground zero

28:13.893 --> 28:16.827
        for a number of
       extreme hauntings.

28:16.829 --> 28:19.830
     - There's so many off
   vibrations in this place.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.368
          (eerie music)

28:26.439 --> 28:28.172
      - Chloe, I'm coming.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.840
    - Caleb, where are you?

28:29.842 --> 28:32.710
- Bedroom, the end of the hall.

28:32.712 --> 28:33.911
         Real bad odor.

28:34.980 --> 28:35.846
     - Oh my god, here too.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.081
    What do you think it is?

28:38.117 --> 28:39.717
       - Familiar smell.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.188
Can't quite put my finger on it.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.256
          Salty sweet.

28:46.258 --> 28:47.791
          Mostly socks.

28:48.994 --> 28:50.160
            Oh yeah.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.462
 Switching to black light mode.

28:51.464 --> 28:52.463
       - Okay fine, socks.

28:52.465 --> 28:53.764
   Can we please move on now?

28:53.766 --> 28:56.734
          - Oh oh yeah.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.869
       Copious ejaculate.

28:58.871 --> 29:02.039
     Someones been whacking
    off into these argyles.

29:02.041 --> 29:04.141
         - Well at least
      there's some finery.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.744
          - Oh crusty.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.445
       Like a burnt pita.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.481
        - This is nice.

29:10.483 --> 29:11.482
          - Biohazard.

29:13.786 --> 29:15.018
      Call the rental guys.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.887
       - This is gorgeous.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.756
  At least they had some class.

29:18.758 --> 29:19.757
       - Hang on, Chloe.

29:19.759 --> 29:20.758
           I'm coming.

29:20.760 --> 29:21.825
     Do not touch anything.

29:21.827 --> 29:24.528
I repeat, do not touch anything.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.033
             Chloe.

29:30.035 --> 29:30.901
             Chloe?

29:30.903 --> 29:31.835
            - What?

29:31.837 --> 29:33.403
     - Remove the kerchief.

29:34.507 --> 29:35.439
             - Why?

29:36.842 --> 29:38.308
It looks nice, don't you think?

29:39.512 --> 29:40.844
            - Chloe.

29:40.846 --> 29:43.180
           (gagging)

29:43.182 --> 29:45.048
      - Get it, get it off.

29:46.352 --> 29:47.518
  Caleb get it off, get it off.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.119
       No I don't want it.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.187
          - Its clear.

29:51.056 --> 29:52.322
          You're clear

29:52.324 --> 29:53.791
        - What the fuck?

29:55.261 --> 29:57.528
            (groans)

29:57.530 --> 30:00.531
   - [Narrator] Sheila and Ebe
    have tracked Murph across

30:00.533 --> 30:04.201
      town to a mysterious
      undisclosed location.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.937
  Behold, property number four.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.806
       The Maitland house.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.140
      - What is this place?

30:10.142 --> 30:11.475
    - I don't know, Sheila.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.943
    - Oh this is so creepy.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.511
      - God damn it, what's
       he doing in there?

30:14.513 --> 30:17.080
    - He's keeping all these
    secrets and I'm nervous

30:17.082 --> 30:19.349
       that there's gonna
      be a lot of surprises

30:19.351 --> 30:21.552
  that we are not anticipating.

30:21.554 --> 30:22.837
      - This is the place.

30:22.838 --> 30:24.121
        This is what he's
     been hiding all along.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.889
       Goddamn it, Sheila.

30:25.891 --> 30:27.090
          This is gold.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.161
       (ethereal roaring)

30:31.163 --> 30:32.896
   - What the fuck was that?

30:32.898 --> 30:34.097
       - Well the Maitland
     house was a big shock.

30:34.099 --> 30:35.499
       The fact that Murph
        Evans was keeping

30:35.501 --> 30:37.968
         this from us, I
       can't treat someone

30:37.970 --> 30:39.369
       who keeps secrets.

30:39.371 --> 30:40.437
           Stay put.

30:40.439 --> 30:41.438
   Ebe's gonna check it out.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.176
           - Ebe, Ebe.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.043
        - You're sick in
       the fucking head.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.311
       Be honest about it.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.312
        Don't hide shit

30:48.314 --> 30:50.047
and so he hid Maitland's from us

30:50.049 --> 30:51.915
      and its clearly where
        it all goes down.

30:51.917 --> 30:52.583
    That's where it started.

30:52.585 --> 30:53.984
        I have no doubt

30:53.986 --> 30:55.519
      and I believe that's
    where its gonna end up.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.455
   - Ebe, I am the showrunner.

30:58.457 --> 30:59.857
      You need my approval.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.124
          What are you,

31:01.126 --> 31:02.593
       where did you get
       that jacket from?

31:02.595 --> 31:04.194
  Ebe, I don't know about this.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.330
       - Goddamn it, Murph
       Evans, its Doc Ebe.

31:06.332 --> 31:07.998
    Open this fuckin' door.

31:09.401 --> 31:10.267
  - Okay, I think we should go.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.335
      This seems dangerous.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.070
  - What an invasion of privacy

31:13.072 --> 31:15.472
   cause they haven't any clue
     what they're looking at

31:15.474 --> 31:16.640
     or what they're doing.

31:18.143 --> 31:19.910
       - Alright, Murph,
    what's going on in here?

31:19.912 --> 31:20.944
- What are you guys doing here?

31:20.946 --> 31:22.279
      - What is going on--

31:22.281 --> 31:23.146
           (coughing)

31:23.148 --> 31:24.081
             Jesus.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.416
          What is that?

31:26.418 --> 31:28.518
        I can smell dead
      animals, dead flesh.

31:29.955 --> 31:32.489
       It is a disgusting
       place where perhaps

31:32.491 --> 31:34.558
     one of the most highly
        evolved hoarders

31:34.560 --> 31:38.362
        in my career has
    amassed a hideous shrine

31:38.364 --> 31:40.564
     to his internal demon.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.900
          - We ended up
     discovering this house

31:42.902 --> 31:47.671
       which had the most
        horrendous reek

31:47.673 --> 31:49.039
       coming out of it.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.406
       - That is the smell
        of rotting flesh.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.978
Feces, god damn rotting animals.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.046
        - I don't really
      know what's in there

31:56.048 --> 31:57.648
and I'm so nervous to find out.

31:57.650 --> 31:59.116
   Okay, I don't understand.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.450
  Is this a whole other house?

32:00.452 --> 32:02.052
  - Yeah, this is where I live.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.587
   This is the Maitland house.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.067
            (static)

32:05.068 --> 32:06.546
       - Okay, we are not
    going in there tonight.

32:06.547 --> 32:08.025
      We need some sort of
      biohazard team here.

32:09.061 --> 32:09.993
            Alright.

32:09.995 --> 32:11.995
  - You're making me feel bad.

32:11.997 --> 32:14.131
      - Is there any other
    things we need to know?

32:14.133 --> 32:15.999
   Any secrets you're hiding?

32:16.001 --> 32:17.401
      - Not that I know of.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.536
         Would you like
       the midnight tour?

32:20.539 --> 32:24.041
     (upbeat country music)

32:27.012 --> 32:28.078
          - Okay guys.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.680
We got to be super quiet up here

32:29.682 --> 32:31.682
        cause this attics
       infested with bees.

32:31.684 --> 32:34.518
- Well let's be careful because
    I am extremely allergic.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.337
            I think.

32:36.338 --> 32:38.155
      - I've had a hell of
      a time with the bees.

32:38.157 --> 32:42.092
        They uh, they can
     move faster than I can

32:42.094 --> 32:44.561
    and there was many times
      I wanted to do a job

32:44.563 --> 32:47.164
       and they wouldn't
       let me even do it.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.165
            - Shit.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.099
       - Okay get ready.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.440
           Blast those
      motherfuckers, Chuck.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.275
           - Oh fuck.
      - Run, you dickheads.

32:58.277 --> 33:00.577
 Shit, you gotta be kidding me.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.245
      Oh bees in the attic.

33:02.247 --> 33:04.181
I tell these idiots to be quiet

33:04.183 --> 33:05.048
      and what do they do?

33:05.050 --> 33:06.450
       Make a huge ruckus.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.051
   I think Falcon little ass
     got taken out of there

33:08.053 --> 33:09.453
  by a couple of the big ones.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.054
      - So day one is done

33:11.056 --> 33:14.324
       and this by far is
      the shittiest project

33:14.326 --> 33:15.625
        we've ever done.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.200
           - You okay?

33:23.202 --> 33:24.735
       - Yeah I'm alright.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.337
- So that's day one in the can.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.673
        Which is to say
       the can is empty.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.543
   We didn't really get much
   accomplished today at all.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.446
    - In my expert opinion,
       the Maitland house

33:36.448 --> 33:40.283
     is ground zero for an
    entire town of horrors.

33:40.285 --> 33:43.053
    - Except for get to know
   Murph, that was quite nice.

33:43.055 --> 33:46.289
   He is, he's quite lovable.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.025
  There's something about him.

33:48.027 --> 33:49.760
    - The other houses, the
     Manjuris, the Lemons,

33:49.762 --> 33:52.429
        and that fucking
        Neiland shit box

33:52.431 --> 33:53.630
      really are symptoms,

33:53.632 --> 33:55.298
     tentacles if you will,

33:55.300 --> 33:57.634
    extending out, spilling
      out across this town

33:57.636 --> 34:00.170
   from the Maitland monster.

34:00.172 --> 34:03.040
   - So tomorrow, we're gonna
    concentrate our efforts

34:03.042 --> 34:04.241
     on the Maitland house.

34:04.243 --> 34:07.044
       - And if I can just
      convince Murph Evans

34:07.046 --> 34:10.080
   to exercise that monster,

34:10.081 --> 34:12.349
      then I believe we can
       solve this bullshit

34:12.351 --> 34:13.449
       once and for all.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.594
   - [Narrator] Chloe stumbles
   upon the third floor attic

34:25.597 --> 34:29.199
   and discovers more pieces
   to the Lemon house puzzle.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.203
       - This must be the
     Lemon family archives.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.339
     See what we have here.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.811
    - [Narrator] Meanwhile,
      on the floor below,

34:40.813 --> 34:43.146
        Caleb conducts a
       night vision sweep

34:43.148 --> 34:44.481
    of Mrs. Lemon's bedroom.

34:46.284 --> 34:49.820
      (ethereal whispering)

34:49.822 --> 34:52.155
      - From Flossie Lemon.

34:52.157 --> 34:53.623
     Wonder what she wrote?

34:53.625 --> 34:55.125
          Dear mother,

34:55.127 --> 34:58.361
     the pain in this house
        is so unbearable.

34:59.631 --> 35:02.432
I wish you could feel my suf...

35:02.434 --> 35:03.366
           Oh my god.

35:03.368 --> 35:04.768
I think this is a suicide note.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.577
      That's probably why
    Murph bought this place

35:13.579 --> 35:16.446
 a few months after she drowned
     herself in the bathtub.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.585
         (booming bang)

35:21.587 --> 35:22.486
             Caleb?

35:29.595 --> 35:30.527
          Was that you?

35:31.797 --> 35:34.631
       - That was not me.

35:36.135 --> 35:38.168
          (rock music)

35:38.170 --> 35:41.404
   - Got the injunction today
    to close up Lemon house.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.845
     - [Narrator] The bylaw
    officer does not realize

35:48.847 --> 35:53.917
   he is locking our spiritual
  detectives inside the house.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.887
          (eerie music)

36:01.360 --> 36:02.826
    (car engine sputtering)

36:02.828 --> 36:04.928
   - What the fuck was that?

36:05.764 --> 36:08.431
          (eerie music)

36:23.549 --> 36:25.448
   - [Narrator] For the first
     time in their careers,

36:25.450 --> 36:27.250
     the extreme ghost team

36:27.252 --> 36:30.387
       are on the verge of
     capturing a verifiable

36:30.389 --> 36:31.922
       supernatural being.

36:35.227 --> 36:37.694
          (eerie music)

36:40.933 --> 36:43.466
           (screaming)

36:48.407 --> 36:49.339
            - Hurry!

36:50.809 --> 36:53.543
 - We've never found a ghost...

36:53.545 --> 36:55.679
   - Not jerking off, per say.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.380
       - Not jerking off.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.416
  - People just walk in on you

36:59.418 --> 37:01.384
     and don't really think

37:01.386 --> 37:03.820
       that this might be
       your private space.

37:03.822 --> 37:04.821
           - Oh shit.

37:04.823 --> 37:05.889
           (mumbles)

37:05.891 --> 37:06.756
       did you get that?

37:06.758 --> 37:07.691
           Holy shit.

37:07.693 --> 37:10.427
     - There was a fucking
      naked ghost in there.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.928
- No I didn't think about that,

37:11.930 --> 37:13.897
    that vagrant at Lemons.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.700
   I guess he was living under
    the veranda or something.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.470
      - Hurry up, hurry up.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.306
      Open the door, Caleb!

37:23.308 --> 37:25.775
 - Its locked from the outside.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.446
           (screaming)

37:34.953 --> 37:36.987
 - [Narrator] It is now day two

37:36.989 --> 37:38.455
of the Murph Evans intervention.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.323
       Our team descends
        bright and early

37:40.325 --> 37:42.859
    on the newly discovered
        Maitland house.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.928
        The Duke and his
       posse are the first

37:44.930 --> 37:47.564
      to break the seal on
     the most extreme haunt

37:47.566 --> 37:49.866
      in Murph's inventory.

37:49.868 --> 37:50.734
            - Stop!

37:50.736 --> 37:52.869
    - Here we are, day two.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.437
       New house, new job.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.006
          New outlook.

37:56.008 --> 37:58.608
  - Well, it was built in 1874

37:58.610 --> 38:01.344
      and its had additions
          right through

38:01.346 --> 38:02.946
        till the 1920s.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.448
    - Murph, what's popping?

38:05.450 --> 38:06.583
          I'm the Duke.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.751
     This heres the Falcon.

38:07.753 --> 38:10.353
     - I told them I didn't
        need no damn bin.

38:10.355 --> 38:11.888
      Oh they're terrible.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.891
  They're sloppy and careless.

38:15.727 --> 38:16.593
   - Come on Ivey, let's go.

38:16.595 --> 38:17.961
       No the other way.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.696
     - Drop everything and
   track dirt into everything

38:19.698 --> 38:21.965
   and they should be doing,

38:21.967 --> 38:23.500
       working in barns.

38:25.871 --> 38:27.304
        - [Narrator] The
       contractors suit up

38:27.306 --> 38:29.439
         to inspect the
       Maitland property.

38:29.441 --> 38:32.309
    They have just one hour
    to complete their survey

38:32.311 --> 38:34.544
   and submit their estimates.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.616
         - I think Murph
      Evans is a great guy.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.718
       Hopefully we'll be
    able to clear his house

38:41.720 --> 38:42.919
    and also clear his mind.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.321
       Really excited to
       help you out here.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.389
       So we can't wait to
      see the inside, sir.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.926
           (gagging)

38:49.928 --> 38:51.661
    - When we first stormed
   into the Maitland's house,

38:51.663 --> 38:53.363
   I was not ready for that.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.597
        It looked like a
    tornado and a hurricane

38:54.599 --> 38:55.532
      got in a fight fist.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.399
 We got a lot of problems here.

38:56.401 --> 38:58.735
      We got mold, mildew.

39:02.007 --> 39:02.928
           (laughing)

39:02.929 --> 39:03.850
      What are you laughing
          at, chuckles?

39:03.851 --> 39:04.772
You'll be the one scrubbing it.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.409
           Okay, boys.

39:06.411 --> 39:07.344
         We got a lot of
     support problems here.

39:07.346 --> 39:08.378
 These studs are too far apart.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.879
This support walls missing here.

39:09.881 --> 39:12.549
       The ceiling joints
       look compromised.

39:12.551 --> 39:15.485
    - They're just in there
rumbling and tumbling everything

39:15.487 --> 39:18.021
   and making a damn big mess.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.522
        - Looks like the
        kitchen in here.

39:19.524 --> 39:20.890
       An exposed wires.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.425
        These pipes need
        to be insulated.

39:22.427 --> 39:23.927
       Ceiling looks like
       its sagging a bit.

39:23.929 --> 39:26.496
        - Stuff was just
      piled and piled like

39:26.498 --> 39:27.831
erratically all over the place.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.032
          It was rough.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.769
- You can smell the raw sewage.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.972
     Probably long backed up
   and shut down by the town.,

39:35.974 --> 39:37.974
       - Its okay Murph,
    nothing we can't handle.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.776
   He's a stage five hoarder.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.645
     - You got to remember
   that when I got this place

39:42.647 --> 39:45.982
    it was 12 apartments and
     there was a great deal

39:45.984 --> 39:47.851
           of damage.

39:47.852 --> 39:49.719
    - So I just got down with
  the inspection of the inside.

39:52.924 --> 39:53.923
      And to put it mildly,

39:53.925 --> 39:55.308
        we're dickered.

39:55.309 --> 39:56.692
      Not enough time, not
       near enough money,

39:56.695 --> 39:57.994
   not good enough employees.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.063
         Its a tear down
       from the ground up.

40:00.065 --> 40:01.564
       - [Narrator] After
         a rough night,

40:01.566 --> 40:04.467
     the paranormal team is
    lucky to have survived.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.003
           - Oh god.

40:07.873 --> 40:08.872
            Oh god.

40:08.874 --> 40:10.940
           (panting)

40:10.942 --> 40:12.742
        Last night, uh.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.711
       - Well Caleb cried.

40:14.712 --> 40:16.679
     - Things happened and
    unexpected events unfold

40:16.681 --> 40:18.681
       and you just got to
     roll with the punches.

40:18.683 --> 40:21.951
       Its part of the uh,
      its part of the game.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.687
      - Okay so day one was
      a complete write off

40:24.689 --> 40:26.990
       but we started day
        two with a bang.

40:26.992 --> 40:28.124
  Alright, everyone, listen up.

40:28.126 --> 40:30.126
        We have a second
    chance here on day two.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.761
       So if we can clean
       the Maitland house,

40:31.763 --> 40:33.596
   and I mean scrub it clean,

40:33.598 --> 40:35.165
        reform Murph and
       give him the tools

40:35.167 --> 40:36.699
       to succeed with his
        other properties,

40:36.701 --> 40:38.435
  then we'll have done our job

40:38.437 --> 40:40.470
       but I need a status
      update from everyone.

40:40.472 --> 40:41.971
 I need to stay on track today.

40:41.973 --> 40:43.173
       I need to know what
        you're all going.

40:43.175 --> 40:45.008
        So ghosties, hit
       me with the facts.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.143
      - Caleb's gonna do a
    prelim pan of the house

40:47.145 --> 40:48.711
          and a general
       sweep and make sure

40:48.713 --> 40:50.847
    there's no dirty little
    secrets hiding in there.

40:50.849 --> 40:52.449
          - Okay, good.

40:52.451 --> 40:53.583
      Derek, what are your
   thoughts on the interior?

40:53.585 --> 40:54.517
      - That house is evil.

40:54.519 --> 40:57.720
  Creepy, it reeks, its fucked.

40:57.722 --> 40:59.155
       We're gonna need a
      lot of disinfectant.

40:59.157 --> 41:00.790
        - Yeah well with
       Murph's approval,

41:00.792 --> 41:02.125
  we can start clearing a path

41:02.127 --> 41:03.526
   and start removing stuff.

41:03.528 --> 41:04.661
    - Wait, wait slow down.

41:04.663 --> 41:06.596
Dr. Ebe, what are your thoughts?

41:06.598 --> 41:08.465
    - Well I've asked him to
   throw a couple things out

41:08.467 --> 41:10.633
      and he just does it.

41:10.635 --> 41:13.069
        I'm hoping for a
     little more resistance

41:13.071 --> 41:16.206
      so I can put on some
    of the Ebe drama there.

41:16.208 --> 41:18.541
       But he's not, he's
         not resisting.

41:18.543 --> 41:20.176
       So I'm just gonna
        have to fake it

41:20.178 --> 41:22.545
and you know exorcize his demons

41:22.547 --> 41:26.616
       and get rid of that
        fear and anxiety.

41:26.618 --> 41:28.885
   - Alright, Murph, are you
   ready to christen the bin?

41:28.887 --> 41:31.221
    - [Narrator] The moment
      of truth has arrived

41:31.223 --> 41:32.922
        for Murph Evans.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.891
   If he can pass this test,

41:34.893 --> 41:38.194
     the floodgates of the
   Maitland hoard will open.

41:38.196 --> 41:39.896
        - Oh I guess so.

41:40.966 --> 41:45.034
  (triumphant classical music)

41:45.036 --> 41:47.036
    - Okay, you can do this.

41:47.973 --> 41:50.240
           (cheering)

41:52.978 --> 41:54.577
Alright, bring it in, everyone.

41:54.579 --> 41:56.946
   We have 48 hours to bring
     this place up to code.

41:56.948 --> 41:57.847
        One, two, three

41:57.849 --> 41:59.582
       let's get to work.

41:59.584 --> 42:00.250
            (cheer)

42:00.252 --> 42:01.851
    I rallied the troops up

42:01.853 --> 42:04.053
    and got them all excited,
   got them working as a team.

42:04.055 --> 42:07.524
    - I have full confidence
        in Sheila Smyth.

42:07.526 --> 42:08.925
      - I'm really excited
        to work with her

42:08.927 --> 42:12.195
      and hopefully its the
       first of many jobs.

42:12.197 --> 42:13.263
    - Oh yeah, she's great.

42:13.265 --> 42:14.964
  Very cute, out of my league.

42:14.966 --> 42:16.232
     - That's fine that she
     knows what she's doing

42:16.234 --> 42:18.735
    but try to at least let
    us know what's going on

42:18.737 --> 42:19.669
         would be nice.

42:19.671 --> 42:23.006
    (upbeat pop funk music)

42:27.979 --> 42:28.912
               Oh!

42:58.143 --> 43:01.578
    (upbeat pop funk music)

43:11.623 --> 43:13.957
           (screaming)

43:24.302 --> 43:27.837
    (upbeat pop funk music)

43:44.823 --> 43:46.956
            (shouts)

43:57.302 --> 43:59.902
          (tense rock)

43:59.904 --> 44:02.372
     - Today, we get to shut
   down the Neiland farmhouse,

44:02.374 --> 44:03.373
       once and for all.

44:06.378 --> 44:07.343
          There we go.

44:07.345 --> 44:08.778
   One less mess in Rockford.

44:08.780 --> 44:10.847
    - Oh the bylaw officer.

44:10.849 --> 44:12.849
   What a chunk of shit he is.

44:12.851 --> 44:15.284
     These bureaucrats like
    that just make you sick.

44:17.222 --> 44:20.657
      I hate bylaw officers
         with a passion.

44:20.659 --> 44:22.925
       They're just self
        serving idiots.

44:22.927 --> 44:25.728
      I'd like to just push
       that bylaw officer

44:25.730 --> 44:27.196
   off the highest building.

44:30.135 --> 44:31.968
       - So what was this
      room used for, Murph?

44:31.970 --> 44:34.804
     - Oh it had a bunch of
   ugly old cupboards in it.

44:34.806 --> 44:37.006
         They used for a
     kitchen but I got them

44:37.008 --> 44:38.408
       all tore out now.

44:38.410 --> 44:39.342
            - Okay.

44:42.347 --> 44:43.279
               Oh.

44:44.983 --> 44:46.883
    What is this for, Murph?

44:46.885 --> 44:48.685
       - [Narrator] Sheila
        Smyth is alarmed

44:48.687 --> 44:52.088
     by the discovery of an
     old box of explosives.

44:52.090 --> 44:55.091
   - Okay , I think this may
   be a little bit dangerous

44:55.093 --> 44:57.160
     so we're gonna have to
   secure this somewhere safe.

44:57.162 --> 44:58.828
       - Oh I'll take her
       down to the cellar.

44:58.830 --> 45:00.430
 - Is there any other surprises

45:00.432 --> 45:01.964
        or booby traps I
      need to be aware of?

45:01.966 --> 45:03.366
  - Oh hell, how would I know?

45:04.436 --> 45:07.804
      (somber tense music)

45:09.441 --> 45:11.841
       I'll just put this
       fucker right here.

45:16.781 --> 45:19.982
      (lighthearted music)

45:22.787 --> 45:23.886
        - Oh no, no, no.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.388
   That's part of the therapy.

45:25.390 --> 45:29.292
   I'm gently removing things
  without him being aware of it

45:29.294 --> 45:32.862
     and just to see if he
    will see the empty space

45:32.864 --> 45:34.197
    left behind and I do it

45:34.199 --> 45:36.799
  in the way that I am doing it

45:37.802 --> 45:39.736
 so that it doesn't go detected

45:39.738 --> 45:40.470
       but there's nothing
          in that house

45:40.472 --> 45:42.071
      that one would steal.

45:42.073 --> 45:44.407
          I mean I'm a
      doctor, not a thief.

45:44.409 --> 45:45.441
  Please, you're insulting me.

45:45.443 --> 45:46.375
              Boom.

45:47.178 --> 45:50.346
      (country rock music)

45:53.184 --> 45:54.083
            - Whoo!

45:54.085 --> 45:55.451
        - Jesus Christ.

45:55.453 --> 45:56.819
        You want a mask?

45:56.820 --> 45:58.186
      - Mask, what are you
      talking about, dummy?

45:58.189 --> 45:59.956
   - Well rotted insulation,
      asbestos, rat shit.

45:59.958 --> 46:02.024
       - Listen to this,
       Bosnian Bob Villa

46:02.026 --> 46:03.226
    motherfucker over here.

46:03.228 --> 46:04.093
            (laughs)

46:04.095 --> 46:05.061
       - Its your funeral.

46:05.063 --> 46:05.828
   - There's like animal shit.

46:05.830 --> 46:06.963
        - Oh wait, wait.

46:06.965 --> 46:07.964
               Oh.

46:07.966 --> 46:08.831
          Oh its a cat.

46:08.833 --> 46:09.832
            - Oh no.

46:09.834 --> 46:10.500
          - Holy shit.

46:10.502 --> 46:12.368
           (laughing)

46:12.370 --> 46:14.771
- Clean these pussies up, boys.

46:14.773 --> 46:16.305
   - Holy shit, this is nasty.

46:16.307 --> 46:19.342
   I've never seen that many
    dead cats in one house.

46:19.344 --> 46:21.110
           (cat meows)

46:21.112 --> 46:22.378
      - That's a dead cat.

46:22.380 --> 46:23.513
           Dead cat.
           Dead cat.

46:23.515 --> 46:24.380
           Dead cat.
           Dead cat.

46:24.382 --> 46:25.448
           Dead pussy.

46:25.450 --> 46:26.516
      - Oh no, another one.

46:26.518 --> 46:27.817
           - Dead cat.
           - Dead cat.

46:27.819 --> 46:29.185
           - Dead cat.
         - Oh dead cat.

46:29.187 --> 46:31.387
   - Come get your dead cats.

46:31.389 --> 46:33.856
           (coughing)

46:33.858 --> 46:34.791
           Dead cat.

46:36.928 --> 46:38.861
       - Cats have a life
       span, don't they,

46:38.863 --> 46:41.931
      like any other animal
       and they just crawl

46:41.933 --> 46:45.101
    into a hole and die and
   unless you're on top of it

46:45.103 --> 46:47.069
 well you just don't find them.

46:48.473 --> 46:52.842
   - We have been experiencing
   some real activity up here.

46:52.844 --> 46:53.576
            Chairs.

46:55.380 --> 46:56.279
          More chairs.

47:00.485 --> 47:01.350
              Fuck.

47:04.088 --> 47:05.421
           No chairs.

47:05.423 --> 47:06.556
           No stairs.

47:06.558 --> 47:08.191
  Equals a fucking death trap.

47:09.227 --> 47:11.027
    - Murph, why do you have
      so many chairs, man?

47:11.029 --> 47:12.495
     - Oh well, the chairs,

47:12.497 --> 47:14.030
     a lot of them are here

47:14.032 --> 47:18.568
   is an attempt to get sets
     and pairs and things.

47:20.038 --> 47:23.105
 - And why is it so freezing
   in this wing of the house?

47:23.107 --> 47:24.307
   - Oh its always been cold.

47:24.309 --> 47:25.908
       It was added later.

47:25.910 --> 47:27.510
       Bill, the furnace
       man, he's supposed

47:27.512 --> 47:30.580
  to be coming, he was supposed
   to be here three weeks ago

47:30.582 --> 47:32.248
   and he hasn't got here yet.

47:32.250 --> 47:33.983
- Has anyone ever died in here?

47:33.985 --> 47:35.618
         - Well how the
       hell would I know?

47:39.991 --> 47:41.457
      - No mind is at rest.

47:41.459 --> 47:43.392
Nobody is at home in this world.

47:43.394 --> 47:45.261
I mean you have to ask yourself

47:45.263 --> 47:46.596
    what the hell happened?

47:46.598 --> 47:48.564
        What is out there
      and why is it trying

47:48.566 --> 47:49.599
           to hurt us?

47:50.468 --> 47:53.603
      (upbeat tense music)

48:18.429 --> 48:20.563
    - Well, we're just about
     done back there, now.

48:20.565 --> 48:21.497
           - Perfect.

48:23.167 --> 48:26.168
   Alright, my turn to shine.

48:32.076 --> 48:36.078
     (tense dramatic music)

48:36.080 --> 48:40.049
    - Hi, I've got a theory
    about our friend Murph.

48:40.051 --> 48:43.185
       It requires you to
     peck at his attention.

48:43.187 --> 48:44.320
 - Ebe, you know I have asthma.

48:44.322 --> 48:45.588
       Where's your vape?

48:45.590 --> 48:46.956
           - My vape?

48:46.958 --> 48:47.924
         Oh I'm cutting
       down on that shit.

48:47.926 --> 48:48.991
 Jesus Christ, it will kill ya.

48:48.993 --> 48:50.660
        Heres my theory.

48:50.662 --> 48:53.195
   I believe that Murph Evans
     has compartmentalized

48:53.197 --> 48:54.797
        his personality.

48:54.798 --> 48:56.398
    Which means, now keep up
  with me here, its technical.

48:56.401 --> 48:58.334
    Part of his personality
      is not being shared

48:58.336 --> 49:00.069
       with the other part
       of his personality.

49:00.071 --> 49:01.270
Its complicated but its textbook

49:01.272 --> 49:02.505
and that shouldn't be a problem

49:02.507 --> 49:05.474
    except, its manifesting
     itself in this unified

49:05.476 --> 49:09.278
       meticulous, sort of
      charming personality.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.546
Does this make any sense to you?

49:10.548 --> 49:11.814
           - Hey Ebe?
   - you know what this is--

49:11.815 --> 49:13.081
       - Ebe, you want to
     help me clean up here?

49:13.084 --> 49:14.684
        You want to make
        yourself useful?

49:15.954 --> 49:17.353
  Did you take another Ambien?

49:18.289 --> 49:20.089
      - Oh for fuck sucks.

49:39.310 --> 49:40.443
            - Fuck!

49:41.379 --> 49:43.245
    Had enough of your shit.

49:43.247 --> 49:44.280
    Why the fuck you always
       got to be fucking

49:44.282 --> 49:45.982
      yelling about stuff?

49:46.985 --> 49:48.384
          - I'm hard on
       these dumb bitches.

49:48.386 --> 49:50.119
   What do you fucking expect?

49:50.121 --> 49:51.187
          This is war.

49:58.529 --> 50:00.663
   - You can do it yourself.

50:03.001 --> 50:04.000
            - Fuck!

50:04.002 --> 50:06.536
           - Damn it.

50:06.537 --> 50:09.071
      - There is some real
      crazy electromagnetic

50:09.073 --> 50:12.008
       activity occurring
  throughout the entire house.

50:13.478 --> 50:15.478
Unless this isn't working right.

50:15.480 --> 50:17.013
      - Oh no, its working.

50:17.015 --> 50:18.147
           Trust me.

50:19.484 --> 50:20.750
   - What is your gut saying?

50:20.752 --> 50:23.419
    - Dude, I've never felt
     more sick in my life.

50:24.422 --> 50:25.588
   - Maybe you're with child.

50:25.590 --> 50:27.356
   - Caleb, let's get serious.

50:27.358 --> 50:30.760
      I am feeling a really
      unresolved presence.

50:30.762 --> 50:33.029
   Okay Chloe, so what are we
    talking about here then?

50:33.031 --> 50:35.498
       We got a ghost, a
        spirit, a demon,

50:35.500 --> 50:37.633
    12 year old girl living
       in the floorboards

50:37.635 --> 50:39.235
       long flowing hair?
     - I don't know, Caleb.

50:39.237 --> 50:40.102
    - Murph's dogs, zombies.

50:40.104 --> 50:41.504
        - I don't know.

50:41.506 --> 50:43.172
    Get the spectrometer and
   lets figure this shit out.

50:44.242 --> 50:46.776
          (eerie music)

50:46.778 --> 50:48.444
       and do it quietly.

50:51.115 --> 50:52.248
         - Simmer down.

50:52.250 --> 50:54.383
         - I'm not your
      fucking dog, aright?

50:55.453 --> 50:57.319
     Yeah, well your breath
        smells like shit.

50:57.321 --> 50:58.754
       I usually can keep
        my shit together

50:58.756 --> 51:02.725
      but (sighs) that time
       I kind of lost it.

51:02.727 --> 51:04.260
   I'm not fucking doing it.

51:04.262 --> 51:05.461
       - Chuck, you do it.

51:05.463 --> 51:06.729
       - No freaking way.

51:06.731 --> 51:08.597
     - How bout I call your
     fucking parole officer

51:08.599 --> 51:10.132
        and tell him that
       I caught you trying

51:10.133 --> 51:11.666
      to suck Dr. Ebe off
    cause you're the biggest

51:11.669 --> 51:12.768
     pervert on the planet?

51:12.770 --> 51:14.236
   - Stand up to him, Chuck.

51:14.238 --> 51:15.371
          He's a pussy.

51:15.373 --> 51:16.539
  - I think you're just afraid.

51:16.541 --> 51:18.240
        - Oh I'm afraid,
       am I, golden girls.

51:18.242 --> 51:19.341
    Okay, daddy will do it.

51:19.343 --> 51:20.643
      No, daddy will do it.

51:20.645 --> 51:21.510
           - Okay dad.

51:21.512 --> 51:22.812
       - Daddy will do it.

51:22.814 --> 51:23.679
   What are you gonna do, huh?

51:23.681 --> 51:24.547
     What are you gonna do?

51:24.549 --> 51:25.681
     What are you gonna do?

51:25.683 --> 51:26.615
      - You're a delinquent
         fucking father,

51:26.617 --> 51:27.550
   get the fuck out of here.

51:28.553 --> 51:29.485
            - Ta da.

51:29.487 --> 51:30.820
   Nothing in it, pussy holes.

51:30.822 --> 51:32.088
        - No dead cats?

51:32.690 --> 51:35.758
       (tense eerie music)

51:36.661 --> 51:37.526
          - Fuck this!

51:37.528 --> 51:38.694
    What the fuck was that?

51:38.696 --> 51:40.496
        - This house has
       a lot of surprises

51:40.498 --> 51:43.766
      and one was when Jago
       got slimed in face.

51:43.768 --> 51:45.501
         - Fucking hot!

51:45.503 --> 51:47.103
        - Jesus Christ.

51:47.105 --> 51:48.637
Told that fucker to wear a mask.

51:48.639 --> 51:50.706
   Jago is insane right now.

51:50.708 --> 51:53.375
      He's dangerous, he's
      becoming a liability

51:53.377 --> 51:55.544
 and he is completely unstable.

51:55.546 --> 51:57.146
 I can't deal with this anymore

51:57.148 --> 51:59.515
         and frankly, I
     fucking hate this guy.

52:00.384 --> 52:01.584
      - I don't know, its,

52:01.586 --> 52:05.321
      its like every room,
       everything in here,

52:05.323 --> 52:08.657
          is emitting
   electromagnetic positives

52:08.659 --> 52:10.459
  which is freaking impossible.

52:10.461 --> 52:13.395
- What if it is possible, Caleb?

52:13.397 --> 52:16.465
     What everything in this
  place is actually possessed?

52:16.467 --> 52:19.168
    - [Narrator] Shame based
    therapy is a tough game.

52:19.170 --> 52:22.605
   Dr. Ebe finds a hole in the
  way for his daily power nap.

52:23.407 --> 52:25.808
           (shouting)

52:25.810 --> 52:28.878
       (tense eerie music)

52:32.283 --> 52:34.283
    - Are you getting this?

52:36.888 --> 52:39.288
    - Seriously, be careful.

52:39.290 --> 52:40.422
      - Where, what's that?

52:41.425 --> 52:42.691
    Was anyone here before?

52:42.693 --> 52:44.393
    - It came from that way.

52:45.630 --> 52:48.697
           (shouting)

52:48.699 --> 52:49.665
       be careful, Caleb.

52:52.770 --> 52:54.436
           - Get out!

52:54.438 --> 52:55.704
            Get out.

52:55.706 --> 52:56.839
            Get out.

52:58.309 --> 53:00.843
       - Hearing the walls
        screaming at you,

53:00.845 --> 53:02.745
       get out, get out.

53:02.747 --> 53:04.713
        - That was a bone
      chilling experience.

53:05.783 --> 53:08.851
       (heavy metal music)

53:09.854 --> 53:11.453
        - Fucking house!

53:11.455 --> 53:12.721
        Fucking fridge.

53:15.726 --> 53:16.659
          Fucking Ivey.

53:17.662 --> 53:20.462
            (shouts)

53:20.464 --> 53:21.397
            - Fuck.

53:25.269 --> 53:27.636
      - [Narrator] Jago's
   aggravated assault on Ivey

53:27.638 --> 53:30.706
        reveals a hidden
    staircase to the cellar.

53:37.548 --> 53:39.481
           (coughing)

53:39.483 --> 53:41.383
       - Fucks that smell?

53:41.385 --> 53:43.285
      - Hey look, jack off.

53:43.287 --> 53:44.286
       What's for dinner?

53:45.623 --> 53:48.224
   Get it, cause you ate shit.

53:48.226 --> 53:50.492
      - You two, move these
        fucking cabinets.

53:50.494 --> 53:52.361
      You, andale, andale.

53:52.363 --> 53:55.231
  Hey, bumble fuck, get the dry
  wall out of your fucking ears

53:55.233 --> 53:57.566
    and move these cabinets.

54:00.404 --> 54:01.770
          (eerie music)

54:01.772 --> 54:03.772
      - [Narrator] Midway
   through day two, a ghastly

54:03.774 --> 54:06.642
  Maitland secret is unearthed.

54:06.644 --> 54:08.244
           (screaming)

54:08.246 --> 54:09.511
        - Jesus Christ!

54:11.816 --> 54:13.515
         - Hey doc, Jago
      needs to talk to you.

54:13.517 --> 54:14.984
          - What is it?

54:14.986 --> 54:16.318
      - We found something.

54:23.661 --> 54:25.594
  - I got you now, Murph Evans.

54:25.596 --> 54:27.529
    - Sheila is gonna shit.

54:27.531 --> 54:29.114
    - Alright guys, listen.

54:29.115 --> 54:30.698
      We don't jump to any
      conclusion with this.

54:30.701 --> 54:32.968
We don't make any bad decisions.

54:32.970 --> 54:34.270
   We got to keep our heads.

54:34.272 --> 54:36.005
- He's probably the furnace guy.

54:36.007 --> 54:37.406
  Maybe he had a heart attack.

54:37.408 --> 54:38.407
   - Zip it, Mexican Matlock.

54:38.409 --> 54:39.808
    This is fucking serious.

54:39.810 --> 54:41.010
       - Whoa, whoa, whoa.

54:41.012 --> 54:42.278
      No racism around Ebe.

54:43.681 --> 54:45.714
       I think Murph Evans
         killed this man

54:45.716 --> 54:48.884
      and that means we all
     got to be very careful

54:48.886 --> 54:51.020
       around this guy in
       the future, okay?

54:51.022 --> 54:51.987
        From here on in,
        he is dangerous.

54:51.989 --> 54:53.622
   - What do we do now, doc?

54:53.624 --> 54:55.424
       This man deserves
        a proper burial.

54:55.426 --> 54:59.028
  - Okay, you guys go upstairs
      and divert that idiot

54:59.030 --> 55:02.498
   and I'm gonna uh, I'm gonna
  have to come up with a plan.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.633
       - Well at least put
        a blanket on him.

55:04.635 --> 55:06.969
    - Can we just do another
   take, that will be alright,

55:06.971 --> 55:08.771
     cause I just, I felt,
    need to be a bit bigger

55:08.773 --> 55:10.639
       and we can nix the
    Mexican Matlock, maybe?

55:10.641 --> 55:11.573
   Okay, will that be alright?

55:11.575 --> 55:13.375
   Look uh, just real quick.

55:13.377 --> 55:14.043
           Real quick.

55:14.045 --> 55:15.311
       Thank you, awesome.

55:15.313 --> 55:16.312
       You guys are great.

55:17.782 --> 55:20.449
          (eerie music)

55:24.355 --> 55:25.421
          - Oh my god.

55:26.991 --> 55:29.892
  - The question is, has Murph
    Evans every killed anyone

55:29.894 --> 55:31.060
         in this house.

55:33.064 --> 55:34.630
           Possibly.

55:34.632 --> 55:35.564
          Is he capable

55:37.034 --> 55:38.467
       of killing someone?

55:38.469 --> 55:40.180
           Absolutely

55:40.181 --> 55:41.892
      and I think he would
      go for the weak link

55:41.893 --> 55:43.604
  in the pecking order, I think
   that would be Charles Ivey.

55:43.607 --> 55:44.540
          Poor bastard.

55:45.042 --> 55:46.675
          Ebe is safe.

55:48.646 --> 55:49.578
            I think.

55:56.754 --> 55:58.020
       Sheila, come here.

55:58.022 --> 56:00.055
       - What is it, Ebe?
      We're running behind.

56:00.057 --> 56:01.757
       - What if I was to
      tell you we're about

56:01.759 --> 56:03.359
to make reality TV show history?

56:03.361 --> 56:04.526
   - Don't pitch me, we don't
    have time for this shit.

56:04.528 --> 56:06.028
     - Okay, you know what?

56:06.030 --> 56:08.364
Murph Evans is a serial killer.

56:08.366 --> 56:09.498
   - Oh for fucks sake, Ebe.

56:09.500 --> 56:10.699
   He's not a serial killer.

56:10.701 --> 56:11.633
       I don't even think
      the guys a hoarder--

56:11.635 --> 56:13.736
       - I found a body!

56:15.840 --> 56:16.772
              Yeah.

56:17.842 --> 56:19.041
            - Fuck.

56:19.043 --> 56:21.710
          (eerie music)

56:23.848 --> 56:25.381
      Holy shit, who is he?

56:25.383 --> 56:27.516
       - That, my friends,
       is the furnace man.

56:28.452 --> 56:30.052
  - Judging by my calculations.

56:30.054 --> 56:31.520
He's been dead for a long time.

56:31.522 --> 56:32.955
        - We'll I'd like
     permission to assemble

56:32.957 --> 56:34.473
   an arrest team right away.

56:34.474 --> 56:35.990
      - There's no fucking
       arrest teams, Ebe,

56:35.993 --> 56:37.393
       you're losing it.

56:37.395 --> 56:38.727
       - Ivey's reliable,
       he's on probation.

56:38.729 --> 56:40.062
          - What are we
       talking about here?

56:40.064 --> 56:41.931
      - Well I'll tell you
   what we're talking about.

56:41.932 --> 56:43.799
          Last night I
      witnessed Murph Evans

56:43.801 --> 56:47.069
   come into this house with
     baby food and diapers.

56:47.071 --> 56:48.437
        - Motherfucker.

56:48.438 --> 56:49.804
      - Yeah, so that means
      that there's not only

56:49.807 --> 56:51.807
      probably a bunch of
   bodies laying around here.

56:51.809 --> 56:53.709
        I think there's a
      very good probability

56:53.711 --> 56:56.478
       that Murph Evans is
      raising a small child

56:56.480 --> 56:58.147
      in this fucking mess.

56:58.149 --> 56:59.681
        - I think I need
       to call the cops.

56:59.683 --> 57:00.983
 - No, we're not gonna do that.

57:00.985 --> 57:03.152
         That's the last
      thing we're gonna do.

57:03.154 --> 57:05.454
       We're gonna do this
        in house, folks.

57:05.456 --> 57:06.688
       We're gonna bring
       this bad boy home,

57:06.690 --> 57:08.590
     reality justice style.

57:08.592 --> 57:09.958
     - Extreme arrest team.

57:09.960 --> 57:10.826
       - For fucks sake.

57:10.828 --> 57:11.960
    I'm calling the police.

57:11.962 --> 57:13.629
          - No, no, no.

57:13.631 --> 57:14.830
      Let's use our heads.

57:14.832 --> 57:16.165
      If we call the cops,
       this show is done.

57:16.167 --> 57:18.100
- That's the right thing to do.

57:18.102 --> 57:19.034
       There's a dead man.

57:19.036 --> 57:20.969
  - No cops, no cops, no cops.

57:20.971 --> 57:21.837
              Okay?

57:21.839 --> 57:22.704
           Zero cops.

57:22.706 --> 57:23.872
           - Oh god.

57:23.874 --> 57:25.841
        We're gonna need
        so many lawyers.

57:25.843 --> 57:27.843
   - That is not my problem.

57:27.845 --> 57:30.212
   I got to find Murph Evans.

57:30.213 --> 57:32.580
  I've got to sit down, we got
to get an on camera confession.

57:32.583 --> 57:33.982
    I'm a human being first

57:33.984 --> 57:36.919
and I guess a scientist second.

57:36.921 --> 57:39.455
       When I stand in a
        place like this,

57:39.457 --> 57:42.124
    this Maitland house, I,

57:43.461 --> 57:45.794
      well I feel like I'm
      witnessing literally

57:45.796 --> 57:47.463
    the pain of another man.

57:47.465 --> 57:48.664
       I'm inside of him.

57:49.800 --> 57:51.200
      I connect with that.

57:51.202 --> 57:53.168
   Okay listen, Jago, you go
    grab your hobo junkies,

57:53.170 --> 57:55.003
      come down here, throw
       this stiff outside

57:55.005 --> 57:56.738
  and then move around and see
    if you can find some more

57:56.740 --> 57:57.906
   of these god damn bodies.

57:57.908 --> 57:59.041
   - No extreme arrest team?

57:59.043 --> 58:00.809
         - What about a
       fucking legal team?

58:00.811 --> 58:02.010
          - Okay look.

58:02.012 --> 58:06.615
        At the end of the
       day, we arrest him.

58:06.617 --> 58:09.785
   In the meantime, let's get
   our before after pictures

58:09.787 --> 58:10.786
       with the clean ups
        and everything,

58:10.788 --> 58:12.654
    let's put it in the can

58:12.656 --> 58:14.523
   and the job is done, okay?

58:14.525 --> 58:15.257
            Go team.

58:16.494 --> 58:17.226
             Ready?

58:19.096 --> 58:20.762
       (soft somber music)

58:20.764 --> 58:21.697
            come on.

58:26.070 --> 58:27.970
 - Oh this is fucked up, Chuck.

58:27.972 --> 58:29.771
           (grunting)

58:29.773 --> 58:31.640
         - I'm not even
     getting paid for this.

58:31.642 --> 58:32.508
          - Here we go.

58:32.510 --> 58:33.509
       Okay, you got him?

58:34.979 --> 58:36.845
       - Hold on a sec, I
       got to turn around.

58:36.847 --> 58:39.915
           (grunting)

58:39.917 --> 58:41.383
           - Come on.

58:41.384 --> 58:42.850
      - Oh shit, I'm caught
       on something here.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.853
           (coughing)

58:44.855 --> 58:46.255
- Ivey come on, I'm gonna puke.

58:46.257 --> 58:47.122
           Let's go.

58:47.124 --> 58:48.524
            (groans)

58:48.526 --> 58:49.992
       Ivey, stop resting,
     let's move this stiff.

58:49.994 --> 58:50.859
         - I'm snagged.

58:50.861 --> 58:51.827
      - Jesus Christ, Ivey.

58:51.829 --> 58:52.861
  Come on, we're almost there.

58:52.863 --> 58:53.729
           Let's go.

58:53.731 --> 58:54.663
           - Fish on.

58:56.667 --> 58:57.599
            (groans)

58:57.601 --> 58:58.233
  - What's wrong with your ear?

58:58.235 --> 58:59.868
     - I got hell raisered.

58:59.870 --> 59:01.487
            - What?

59:01.488 --> 59:03.105
   - [Narrator] The municipal
   bylaw office has processed

59:03.107 --> 59:06.542
     the eviction order for
    Murph's final property.

59:09.747 --> 59:11.246
        - Hurry up with
       that carcass, boys

59:11.248 --> 59:13.015
       it smells like big
       Willy shit himself.

59:13.017 --> 59:14.483
        - Where the hell
        do you want him?

59:14.484 --> 59:15.950
     - Well put him in the
    back of the bin for now.

59:15.953 --> 59:16.818
           - The bin?

59:16.820 --> 59:17.753
      Are you fucking nuts?

59:17.755 --> 59:18.620
- I think I need a tetanus shot.

59:18.622 --> 59:19.588
       (pounding at door)

59:19.590 --> 59:20.756
   - Office of bylaw open up.

59:20.758 --> 59:23.158
         - Listen, don't
       say a fucking word.

59:23.160 --> 59:24.560
   Take this guy around back

59:24.562 --> 59:26.895
      while I go distract
    this fucking guinea pig.

59:26.897 --> 59:29.298
   - They're probably jerking
    each other off in there.

59:29.300 --> 59:31.967
          (tense music)

59:32.836 --> 59:35.170
  - Oh, officer chubby chaser.

59:35.172 --> 59:37.172
       I thought I smelled
      barbecued pig pussy.

59:37.174 --> 59:38.774
         - Where's that
     fruitcake Murph Evans?

59:38.776 --> 59:40.476
         - He's upstairs
      having a bubble bath.

59:40.477 --> 59:42.177
   - Murph Evans hasn't bathed
   a day in his fucking life.

59:42.179 --> 59:43.579
          Cut the shit.

59:43.580 --> 59:44.980
   - Murph had a bit of a late
  one over at the scrub and dub

59:44.982 --> 59:48.116
        and then needs to
      wash his mushy bits.

59:48.118 --> 59:51.153
 - Alright look it, I'm here to
  shut down this fucking show,

59:51.155 --> 59:52.120
            alright?

59:52.122 --> 59:54.856
You and you, this fucking idiot,

59:54.858 --> 59:56.942
       you're gonna move
        these vehicles.

59:56.943 --> 59:59.027
   We're evicting Murph, we're
    condemning the property.

59:59.029 --> 01:00:00.596
           Its done.

01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:01.296
   - You guys weren't supposed
     to be here till Monday.

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:02.931
       - Step aside, sir.

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:06.101
- I don't know if you've heard,

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:08.135
    but I don't mind dancing
     in the daytime at all.

01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:09.071
            - Yeah?
            _ Yeah.

01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:10.422
 - I like to dosie do at night,

01:00:10.423 --> 01:00:11.772
        you and me, nine
      o'clock, town square.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:12.674
      - You want to fight?

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:13.725
            - Yeah.

01:00:13.726 --> 01:00:14.775
       - How bout I shove
      your head up your ass

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:15.344
   and you can fight for air?

01:00:15.346 --> 01:00:16.211
           (gasping)

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:17.279
    - I got a gift for you.

01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:25.621
               Oh.

01:00:25.623 --> 01:00:27.756
   - I thought I smelled dick.

01:00:27.758 --> 01:00:28.957
            - Yeah?

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:30.192
       Well look, I gave
       you guys two days

01:00:30.194 --> 01:00:32.027
       and now times up.

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:33.795
 - You see that bin over there?

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:34.763
            - Yeah?

01:00:34.765 --> 01:00:36.098
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.966
         All we've been
      doing here is trying

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.835
 to save this god forsaken town

01:00:39.837 --> 01:00:42.237
    and help Murph Evans by
     cleaning up rat shit,

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:45.674
  ghost poop, and donkey dung.

01:00:45.676 --> 01:00:47.909
    And this is the kind of
treatment you're gonna give us?

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.045
              Huh?

01:00:50.047 --> 01:00:51.813
      - Alright, I'll tell
     you what I'm gonna do.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.216
    You got one more day and
    then I come and shutter

01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:55.217
       this dump, alright?

01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:56.318
     - Yeah, wise decision.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:00:59.655
            (laughs)

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:00.322
          (blows kiss)

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:01.189
             Yummy.

01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:03.792
     Too da loo, fuck head.

01:01:03.794 --> 01:01:06.828
       - So far, we've got
      two dozen dead cats,

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.664
 we got a deceased furnace man,

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:11.333
       the funky furniture
     is jamming up my gear.

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:12.834
What the fuck is going on here?

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:15.804
     - From the outside, it
      just looks like a bad

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:17.339
       mold infestation.

01:01:18.409 --> 01:01:21.076
         - What the hell
       are you doing here?

01:01:21.078 --> 01:01:24.112
          (clattering)

01:01:24.114 --> 01:01:27.182
       (eerie tense music)

01:01:31.755 --> 01:01:33.955
           (screams)

01:01:35.426 --> 01:01:38.293
        - It's just Murph
      carrying some chairs.

01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:41.363
     - What in the hell is
   all this shit doing here?

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:42.964
  - These are our headquarters

01:01:42.966 --> 01:01:45.167
 and we need all of this stuff.

01:01:45.169 --> 01:01:46.301
    These are our supplies.

01:01:46.303 --> 01:01:48.904
    This is our work, okay?

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:52.974
   - You even managed to find
  Uncle Jurgis' old wheelchair.

01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:57.245
      - Now we need to ask
      you a few questions.

01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:09.991
      - [Narrator] Without
       notifying the team,

01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:14.296
    Dr. Ebe has inexplicably
    fled the Maitland house.

01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:17.065
       Our cameras tracked
     him to an antique shop

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.400
where he appears to be unloading

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.936
         some of Murph's
     collectibles for cash.

01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:26.475
        - Tell us about
       your home, Murph.

01:02:26.477 --> 01:02:30.212
      - Well Uncle Jurgis'
    and I got it back in 68.

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:32.748
   He was mum's older brother

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:35.751
    and he used to call out
    at the Rockford auction

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:38.019
       and he was really
        one of the best.

01:02:38.021 --> 01:02:40.889
       He was a collector
      and he knew his stuff

01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:44.292
  and he taught me pretty well

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:46.094
       everything I know.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:48.296
 - What happened to your uncle?

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:50.799
    - Well he got very sick

01:02:50.801 --> 01:02:54.436
and lost interest in everything

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:57.205
        and pretty soon
       he couldn't move,

01:02:57.207 --> 01:02:59.374
   ended up in a wheelchair.

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:01.042
  Everything started to pile up

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:03.478
and then it got all left on me.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.181
   - I can feel your uncle's
     presence here, still,

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:08.550
    and I would really like
    to talk to him tonight.

01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:11.987
   - Well I think that would
     be a bit of a problem.

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:16.124
- Chloe, can speak to the dead.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:18.794
          (eerie music)

01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:25.033
   (soft instrumental music)

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.404
           (coughing)

01:03:30.874 --> 01:03:32.240
           (sobbing)

01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:34.242
   - [Narrator] The fractured
     team retreats inward,

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:36.945
        each to confront
     their personal demons.

01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:39.014
          - Fuck this.

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:40.081
     - [Narrator] So begins
       the darkest chapter

01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:41.883
     in reality television.

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:47.489
           (sobbing)

01:03:50.093 --> 01:03:51.026
             - Hey.

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:53.461
              Hey.

01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:56.298
        Hey what's going
       on, what's wrong?

01:03:58.368 --> 01:03:59.968
       - I just, I didn't
         think the show

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:02.037
   was gonna pan out this way.

01:04:02.039 --> 01:04:04.172
  I wanted it to do some good.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.273
       - Its not done yet.

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:06.241
I'm sure there's still some good

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:07.442
     we can make from this.

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:08.310
        - Yeah but what's
      the point if Murph's

01:04:08.312 --> 01:04:09.878
       gonna go to jail?

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:11.445
      He might as well just
        forfeit the house

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:12.447
          to the town.

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:14.382
  - He's not gonna go to jail.

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:15.517
       But what is it that
         you want to do?

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:18.420
   - I just want to do a room.

01:04:18.422 --> 01:04:19.905
        - Just one room?

01:04:19.906 --> 01:04:21.389
      - Just one room, just
      one before and after

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:24.092
   because that's all we told
    everyone we're gonna do.

01:04:25.262 --> 01:04:28.597
       - So let's go find
       you a room to redo.

01:04:28.599 --> 01:04:33.068
        - So here we are
        in our home base

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:34.336
and it has come to our attention

01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:36.571
    that there is a massive

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:39.407
    and I'm talking massive.

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:40.475
             - Big.

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:41.610
        - Energy source

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:47.482
      directly below where
   we're standing right now.

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:50.485
    - [Narrator] Dr. Ebe has
     become unrecognizable.

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:53.221
    His mind is now riddled
    with the very disorders

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:54.956
     he has failed to cure.

01:04:56.426 --> 01:04:57.359
  - Hey, Murph, how you doing?

01:04:57.361 --> 01:04:59.294
   Have a seat please, buddy.

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:02.163
       Murph, hi, how are?

01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:03.431
    - You like that settee?

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:05.100
        - Oh the settee,
       I love the settee.

01:05:05.102 --> 01:05:06.167
       I love the settee.

01:05:06.169 --> 01:05:07.335
- [Narrator] On the other hand,

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:09.104
       as the shows falls
        into the abyss,

01:05:09.106 --> 01:05:11.106
 Charles Ivey finds his purpose

01:05:11.108 --> 01:05:13.541
        in decluttering
       the second floor.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:17.312
  - Fantastic city settee, eh?

01:05:17.314 --> 01:05:19.180
    - Well that's John Hall
      Empire at its best.

01:05:19.182 --> 01:05:20.682
       - John Hall Empire?

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:22.183
    And what about that, is
    that a John Hall Empire?

01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:23.118
- No, that's Eastlake, Eastlake.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.319
           - Eastlake?
             - Yeah.

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:25.921
          - Its lovely.

01:05:25.923 --> 01:05:27.389
   Murph, I want to start to
    ask you a few questions,

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:28.490
        okay, if I can?

01:05:28.492 --> 01:05:29.958
    Just a couple questions
        about the place,

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.326
        about the place.

01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:33.061
   The really strange thing,
     I woke up this morning

01:05:33.063 --> 01:05:34.963
         and, and I uh,

01:05:34.965 --> 01:05:36.665
    I figured out how many,

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:38.199
        how many things
       were in the house.

01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:39.067
         It came to me.

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.602
    It was a number, 12,800

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:43.638
   there was a certain number
    of things in the house.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.006
   A certain number of things

01:05:45.008 --> 01:05:46.241
   and the number is 12,000.

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:47.976
   Say it to me, say it to me.

01:05:47.978 --> 01:05:49.077
          Say it to me.

01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:50.712
           - 12,000.
           - 12,587.

01:05:51.548 --> 01:05:52.681
             - 587.

01:05:52.683 --> 01:05:54.215
      - We both know this.
              - Oh.

01:05:54.217 --> 01:05:55.283
    - Its about me and you.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:56.284
  Really at the end of the day,

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:57.419
      its about me and you.

01:05:57.421 --> 01:05:58.553
       Its about being--

01:05:58.555 --> 01:05:59.721
       - Are you alright?
         - it's about.

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:02.157
             - Hey.

01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:03.491
       You guys, I found
       another door here.

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:04.492
       By the looks of it.

01:06:06.229 --> 01:06:07.228
- I think that's Murph's secret.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:08.630
           - Sheila!

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:10.498
 You're gonna want to see this.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.366
  - Where's the diapers, Murph?

01:06:11.368 --> 01:06:12.400
      Where's the diapers?

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:14.169
  Where's the fucking diapers?

01:06:14.171 --> 01:06:15.570
- [Narrator] Of all the secrets

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:17.439
     that Murph has hoarded,
  nothing can prepare the team

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:19.574
      for what comes next.

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:20.709
    - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:06:20.711 --> 01:06:22.043
         I'm so scared.

01:06:22.045 --> 01:06:23.044
   What are they gonna find?

01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:24.312
       I got to stop them.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.114
        I gotta stop em!

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:28.283
       (eerie tense music)

01:06:28.285 --> 01:06:29.317
           - Oh god.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:34.122
           (gagging)
           (coughing)

01:06:34.124 --> 01:06:35.423
   - What the hells in there?

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:37.125
        - I don't know.

01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:38.727
     Looks like its moving.

01:06:38.729 --> 01:06:41.396
          (eerie music)

01:06:42.466 --> 01:06:44.299
  Caleb, are you getting this?

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:45.433
             - Ebe.

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:47.502
    Ebe, what are you doing?

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:51.006
           Get a grip.

01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:58.079
    - Oh my god, the smell.

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:00.281
          - Holy shit!

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:04.419
         - Oh I see you
       found Uncle Jurgis.

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:07.022
    - Murph, you gotta tell
   us about stuff like this.

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:08.656
         - Is he alive?

01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:11.493
      - I mean borderline.

01:07:11.495 --> 01:07:12.761
        - How old is he?

01:07:12.763 --> 01:07:14.629
           - He's 103.

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:18.033
        - I'm Dr. Ebe and
      these are my friends

01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:22.037
     are we're here to help
   your nephew, Murph Evans.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:26.708
 (guttural otherworldly speech)

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:30.645
That's Latin and its backwards.

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:31.780
          Jesus Christ.

01:07:31.782 --> 01:07:33.314
         - No it isn't.

01:07:33.316 --> 01:07:34.315
        Its Lithuanian.

01:07:34.317 --> 01:07:36.351
        Came over on the
        boat in the 20s.

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:38.520
  - Same thing, dead languages.

01:07:39.322 --> 01:07:43.324
 (guttural otherworldly speech)

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:46.127
   - What's he saying Murph?

01:07:46.129 --> 01:07:47.796
 - Oh he's calling you a thief.

01:07:47.798 --> 01:07:49.464
       - Don't translate.

01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:51.533
     Don't, just don't like
     that, don't translate.

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:53.201
       I don't trust it.

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:56.604
         Ghost humpers.

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:59.207
   You know you're way around
     a demonic possession?

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:01.342
       - Well we can most
         certainly try.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:04.412
       - Alright, you're
        my support crew.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:05.780
          I'm going in.

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.816
     I'm gonna make contact
        with the entity.

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:12.353
        Is Uncle Jurgis
       in there with you?

01:08:14.658 --> 01:08:17.559
        (demonic speech)

01:08:24.134 --> 01:08:28.103
   (repeating demonic speech)

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.238
           (screaming)

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.207
    Jesus Christ, holy shit.

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:37.178
         He said, we're
       all afraid to die.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:38.546
   - What does that even mean?

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:39.848
        - I don't know.
       - It sounds legit.

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:41.416
            - Murph.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.518
             Murph?

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.319
  Where the hell did Murph go?

01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:47.589
          - He's gone.

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:48.589
        - Let's get the
       fuck out of here.

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.892
       - Let's clear out.

01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:52.827
        For fucks sake.

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:54.328
             Jesus.

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:55.830
     - I just can't believe
    what we found in there.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:57.465
       This, it just seems
        like a nightmare.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.267
  Just one thing after another.

01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:00.801
       - Our team doesn't
       even know what kind

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:02.670
       of phenomena we're
       dealing with here.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.471
        - There's another
      hoarder, there's two.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:05.807
  - Stop finding fucking rooms.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.274
    What the fuck was that?

01:09:07.277 --> 01:09:08.443
            (laughs)

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:09.844
       - I don't know but
       on the bright side,

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:11.328
          no dead cats.

01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:12.813
     - No I'm talking about
       the dead disgusting

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:13.680
         fucking uncle.

01:09:13.683 --> 01:09:15.149
    - I'm worried about Ebe.

01:09:15.152 --> 01:09:18.353
  He is acting so erratically.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.220
  He's starting to just unravel

01:09:20.223 --> 01:09:22.423
   and I'm worried about this
 whole place is getting to him.

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:24.492
        - Uncle Jurgis is
       the primary holder.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:27.162
      Its a (speaks French)
      its a madness of two

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:29.497
      and that's why this
   thing to so goddamn huge.

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:31.566
       - We can't get any
      readings in the room

01:09:31.568 --> 01:09:33.434
but as soon as you step outside.

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:36.171
  - Readings are off the hook.

01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:36.904
              Why?

01:09:36.907 --> 01:09:37.906
- I thought it was cool meeting,

01:09:37.908 --> 01:09:39.207
    you know, Murph's Uncle.

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:40.642
      It was pretty sweet.

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:41.709
          - Holy fuck.

01:09:52.255 --> 01:09:54.189
             - Ebe?

01:09:54.457 --> 01:09:56.391
              Ebe?

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:58.726
       What the fuck are
       we supposed to do?

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:02.764
       - Well Murph Evans
       is not a hoarder.

01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:04.199
    - Well then what is he?

01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:05.200
         - Complicated.

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:06.768
   - You care to enlighten us?

01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:09.470
       - Think of it as a
       force multiplier.

01:10:09.472 --> 01:10:11.739
        Madness squared.

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:14.542
        One is dominant,
      the other submissive

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:15.677
       and together, they
         are increasing

01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:17.879
     the evil exponentially

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:20.748
     and I also believe that
  just in being in this house,

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:22.550
       around this mess,

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:24.452
we are all part of the equation.

01:10:26.756 --> 01:10:28.423
Murph Evans is not Murph Evans.

01:10:28.425 --> 01:10:31.526
  He has become something else.

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:33.461
 We have never met Murph Evans.

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:35.395
    - So you're saying Uncle
 Jurgis has created this Murph?

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:37.398
        - I believe that
       Murph Evans thinks

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.835
        that the trash of
      this house, the mess,

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:43.671
       the things that are
   collected within its walls,

01:10:43.673 --> 01:10:45.240
   are keeping the uncle alive

01:10:46.376 --> 01:10:47.575
      and I think the uncle
        believes that too

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:50.645
        and you know, I'm
       starting to myself.

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:52.714
       - So where are we
   supposed to go from here?

01:10:52.716 --> 01:10:54.315
        - I don't know.

01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:55.516
   I'm not a medical doctor.

01:10:57.387 --> 01:10:59.988
I'm a failed nurse practitioner.

01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:01.322
       I know, I'm sorry.

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:05.293
   - Look, I think we're all
   going to jail after this.

01:11:05.295 --> 01:11:08.930
       Chloe, Caleb, what
       do you guys think?

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:10.865
      - We definitely know

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:15.270
  that there is an evil entity
    in this space, for sure.

01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:16.771
  - Yep, of course you guys do.

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:21.342
   I'm sorry, that was rude.

01:11:22.812 --> 01:11:24.812
       I didn't mean it.

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:26.813
      I mean I've just been
       given a lot of shit

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:30.351
     right now and I think
   its time to shut it down.

01:11:30.353 --> 01:11:32.420
      Why don't we regroup
   tomorrow and we'll sort out

01:11:32.422 --> 01:11:33.688
           what to do.

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:35.490
      Ghosties, I need you
    guys to stay the night.

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:37.492
  - What do you want us to do?

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:39.727
      - I want you to just
       monitor the floor.

01:11:39.729 --> 01:11:41.429
           - For what?

01:11:41.431 --> 01:11:43.364
    - For ghosts or demons,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.433
       I mean do your job.

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:47.602
    - If anyone experiences
      a mental disturbance

01:11:47.604 --> 01:11:49.637
      no matter how small,
      no matter how subtle,

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:51.506
    report immediately to me

01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:53.007
      and you're gonna have
       to leave the show.

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:54.342
   I'm very sorry, I'm afraid

01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:55.843
that's just gonna have to stand.

01:11:57.714 --> 01:11:59.514
       - When was the last
     time you saw the Duke?

01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:02.917
           (coughing)

01:12:02.919 --> 01:12:03.851
            Oh man.

01:12:04.788 --> 01:12:06.988
           (gagging)

01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:09.524
    - Should I call Dr. Ebe?

01:12:09.526 --> 01:12:11.359
 - No Ivey, Dr. Ebe is a fraud.

01:12:11.361 --> 01:12:12.927
   - Shut the fuck up, Falcon.

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:15.330
        - Fucking nuts.

01:12:17.634 --> 01:12:19.000
            - Ivey.

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:20.401
           (coughing)

01:12:20.403 --> 01:12:21.336
              Ivey.

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:24.939
I don't think I'm gonna be able

01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:26.474
       to make it to the
        end of the job.

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:28.609
       - Okay, let's go to
       the hospital then.

01:12:28.611 --> 01:12:30.878
           (coughing)

01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:35.350
          (whispering)

01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:40.421
    - The fucking cupboard.

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:43.758
         (somber music)

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:51.966
        Those are yours.

01:12:52.836 --> 01:12:55.570
    Those are for you, Duke.

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:57.705
            - Duke?

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:59.040
   You're fucking kidding me?

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:02.510
      - Duke fucking Ivey.

01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:05.113
      - The hold that Uncle
   Jurgis has over Murph Evans

01:13:05.115 --> 01:13:07.515
         is all powerful
       and is it too late?

01:13:07.517 --> 01:13:09.083
   Well yes of course it is.

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:10.518
       Its always too late

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.454
when you're in the care of Ebe.

01:13:13.456 --> 01:13:15.723
      - There have been so
    many curve balls today.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.393
  I mean it seems almost trite

01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:20.595
        to point out how
       far behind we are.

01:13:20.597 --> 01:13:22.063
       I mean there really
      isn't a show anymore

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:25.133
       - Its hard to know
    where the nephew begins

01:13:25.135 --> 01:13:27.602
   and where the uncle ends.

01:13:27.604 --> 01:13:30.171
        Patient, doctor.

01:13:30.173 --> 01:13:34.542
      - I don't know what
    the fuck to do anymore.

01:13:41.684 --> 01:13:44.452
        - Let's go take a
      peek at Uncle Jurgis.

01:13:44.454 --> 01:13:45.820
 - We have to check his vitals.

01:13:45.822 --> 01:13:48.890
       (tense eerie music)

01:14:06.109 --> 01:14:09.577
     (tense dramatic music)

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:16.651
              God.

01:14:16.653 --> 01:14:18.152
       - What is it Chloe?

01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:20.721
     - Uncle Jurgis is dead.

01:14:20.723 --> 01:14:22.123
           Or undead.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:23.458
I don't know, there's no pulse.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.625
      He's cold as a stone.

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:26.761
    - That's a first for us.

01:14:26.763 --> 01:14:27.695
           - I know.

01:14:35.138 --> 01:14:36.604
       What are you doing?

01:14:38.074 --> 01:14:40.908
 - I'm going to take a picture.

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:41.843
             - Why?

01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:44.145
      - For the Instagram.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:45.880
    We're losing followers.

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:48.015
    Now make a pretty face.

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:54.222
        (camera clicks)
           (roaring)

01:14:54.224 --> 01:14:56.757
           (screaming)

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.993
       - Damn it, Caleb.

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:05.032
       - I feel like shit,
     to be honest with you.

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:07.568
        I feel like I've
       let everybody down.

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:11.172
   Like I'm still processing
   that we found a dead body.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:13.241
       - This whole thing
         was a mistake.

01:15:13.243 --> 01:15:15.643
       The job, the house.

01:15:16.579 --> 01:15:17.812
            My life.

01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:18.813
    - I know I was supposed
    to be leading this show

01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:22.083
         but I'm stuck.

01:15:22.085 --> 01:15:23.117
   I don't know where to go.

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:24.652
    - I think its all over,

01:15:25.788 --> 01:15:27.855
         for all of us.

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.923
      - Personally, I feel
    like we're kicking ass.

01:15:29.926 --> 01:15:32.059
         - I don't know
       what we're gonna do

01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:33.661
       and I'm not looking
       forward to this day

01:15:33.663 --> 01:15:34.729
      or this conversation.

01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:36.597
          - [Narrator]
    Showrunner Sheila Smyth

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:38.933
   has assembled the team on
    the morning of day three

01:15:38.935 --> 01:15:40.735
      to make an important
          announcement.

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:41.702
          - Okay, guys.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.204
   Its day three, look alive.

01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:44.872
        This production
    meeting is to determine

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:46.107
   the way out of this mess.

01:15:46.109 --> 01:15:48.609
    So I believe we already
      have an unbelievable

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:50.878
   amount of shit in the can
    but here's the problem.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.147
         This production
      team has gone feral.

01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:55.683
       You teams have done
       some fucked up shit

01:15:55.685 --> 01:15:57.685
        and I don't even
      know where we stand.

01:15:57.687 --> 01:15:59.270
       I need direct talk.

01:15:59.271 --> 01:16:00.854
     I need to know what's
    going on with everyone,

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:02.890
 no matter how fucked up it is.

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:04.091
              Ivey?

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:04.959
          - Yes, ma'am?

01:16:04.961 --> 01:16:06.127
    - What happened to Jago?

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:07.828
       - I think, I think
       he may be a zombie.

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:08.763
       - What do you mean?

01:16:08.765 --> 01:16:09.830
   Does he need medical help?

01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:15.937
     - Alright, here it is.

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:17.738
   The uncle is exerting some
    kind of a mental control

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.274
      over Murph Evans and
   they've taken that practice

01:16:20.276 --> 01:16:23.644
 of hoarding and they've kicked
    it up a notch to killing.

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:25.813
         Serial murder.

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:27.981
       I believe that the
     uncle's nervous system

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:33.254
     is sympathetic to the
    contents of this house.

01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:35.289
    - Okay I have no fucking
    clue what you just said.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:37.191
    Chloe, you look scared,
        what's going on?

01:16:37.193 --> 01:16:39.760
    - Uncle Jurgis is dead.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:42.630
            - What?
        - Well, undead.

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:44.198
  We confirmed that last night.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.933
  - So we have an undead uncle

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.868
  and possibly an undead Jago.

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:49.070
      Do I have that right?

01:16:49.072 --> 01:16:51.272
        I think this show
      is completely fucked

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:53.741
     and I think its really
    time to call the police.

01:16:54.677 --> 01:16:56.010
   We have no fucking choice.

01:16:56.012 --> 01:16:56.944
       I have no choice.

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:58.713
None of this is gonna go to air.

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:01.282
       We're probably all
       gonna go to jail.

01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:03.150
Okay, so if we come forward now,

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:04.952
        maybe they'll be
        able to help us.

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:09.023
  I'm sorry guys, I failed you.

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:11.993
        - No, I'm sorry.

01:17:12.895 --> 01:17:14.895
When we set out on this project,

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:18.833
       when Sheila Smyth
       gave us the call,

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:22.169
         she knew it was
      gonna be a tough one

01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:25.740
  but she called you, and you,

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:27.908
   not you, we picked you up,

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:29.777
            but why?

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:33.180
Because each and everyone of you

01:17:33.182 --> 01:17:34.649
       is the very best.

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:36.717
      But its not about us.

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:39.186
Its about that sweet, crazy man,

01:17:39.188 --> 01:17:41.789
   and his bad habit of what?

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:43.991
       He keeps old shit.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:44.992
           Lots of it.

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:47.261
      Is that a bad habit?

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:50.398
  No, its a fucking statement.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.933
       In this fucked up
    world that's choking us

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:55.102
  with disposable consumerism.

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:57.204
Maybe one man and his collection

01:17:57.206 --> 01:17:58.806
       of Queen Ann chairs

01:17:58.808 --> 01:18:01.809
  is saving us from ourselves.

01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:02.910
          Where we are.

01:18:04.981 --> 01:18:05.946
           Right now.

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:08.182
       At this crossroads,

01:18:09.686 --> 01:18:10.751
       and where we'll be

01:18:12.155 --> 01:18:14.889
          is up to us.

01:18:14.891 --> 01:18:18.893
      Don't you people see
       what we have here?

01:18:18.895 --> 01:18:20.895
        Yeah I was stung
        by a dozen bees,

01:18:20.897 --> 01:18:22.697
         Jago ate shit.

01:18:22.699 --> 01:18:24.765
      We found a dead body.

01:18:24.767 --> 01:18:28.102
      Chloe and Caleb, you
     found an undead uncle.

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:29.403
       Isn't that amazing?

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:31.906
     And Ebe, oh sweet Ebe,

01:18:31.908 --> 01:18:34.775
     this whole Murph Evans
    is a serial killer shit

01:18:34.777 --> 01:18:36.177
    that fell into your lap

01:18:36.179 --> 01:18:38.779
     is the best thing that
   could ever happen to you.

01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:40.781
           (laughing)

01:18:40.783 --> 01:18:42.149
        I only have one
       question for you.

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:43.384
        - Let's hear it.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:46.320
 - Do you want to make history?

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:47.321
              Huh?

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:49.123
   I can't fucking hear you!

01:18:49.125 --> 01:18:53.027
   You know you want to make
    extreme fucking history.

01:18:53.029 --> 01:18:55.129
          - Yes we do!
          - Yeah we do!

01:18:56.866 --> 01:18:58.799
   - So let's fucking do it.

01:18:58.801 --> 01:19:01.335
           (shouting)
           (cheering)

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:03.337
    - Oh my god, oh my god.

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:06.006
            (cheers)

01:19:06.008 --> 01:19:07.675
   - Okay you heard the man.

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:09.343
     Battle stations, let's
      get to work, people.

01:19:09.345 --> 01:19:10.811
         Let's do this.

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:12.278
    - [Narrator] In spite of
     all rational arguments

01:19:12.281 --> 01:19:14.949
      to the contrary, the
        crew has resolved

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:16.150
        to move forward.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.186
       - God damn it this
        is a glory day!

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:21.355
     - I feel so pumped up.

01:19:21.357 --> 01:19:22.823
   - Do you hear that Falcon?

01:19:22.825 --> 01:19:24.425
        Jesus he pulled
       it out of his ass.

01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:26.160
 - Sheila was a bit of a downer

01:19:26.162 --> 01:19:28.362
   then the Falcon stepped up.

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:30.164
     - I'm a brand new Ebe.

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:31.965
        I am a brand new
     fucking Ebe right now.

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:34.368
      - Who knew that tiny
       little garbage man

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:35.903
   had so much energy in him

01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:37.438
  to excite a group of people.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.973
       - What a difference
        a morning makes.

01:19:38.975 --> 01:19:40.441
       The Falcon woke up
    this morning very upset

01:19:40.443 --> 01:19:44.445
    but now he's pumped and
   ready to get the job done.

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:46.514
        - I cracked open
        a new toothpick.

01:19:46.516 --> 01:19:47.815
       The day is young.

01:19:47.817 --> 01:19:49.450
   - And we're back on track

01:19:49.452 --> 01:19:50.818
  with what we came here to do.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.453
        Which is change
       Murph Evan's life.

01:19:52.455 --> 01:19:53.954
- I'm going upstairs right now.

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:55.189
  I'm gonna cure Uncle Jurgis.

01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:57.258
     I have no fucking idea
      how I'm gonna do that

01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.994
    but goddamn it, with the
        Falcon and Smyth,

01:19:59.996 --> 01:20:01.061
          we can do it.

01:20:01.998 --> 01:20:04.932
       (uplifting music)

01:20:06.803 --> 01:20:07.468
             - Hey.

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:08.869
             - Hey.

01:20:08.871 --> 01:20:10.204
    - I wanted to thank you.

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:11.405
           - For what?

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:12.373
       - I think I freaked
       everyone out there.

01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:14.809
   - No, no, you were amazing.

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:15.876
           - Really?

01:20:15.878 --> 01:20:17.077
            - Yeah.

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:18.946
       What you have to do
      now is go find Murph.

01:20:18.948 --> 01:20:20.881
   - Where, I don't even know
     where to look for him.

01:20:20.883 --> 01:20:23.884
        - Thrift store,
       his other places.

01:20:23.886 --> 01:20:25.219
   He's a creature of habit.

01:20:25.221 --> 01:20:26.821
     It can't be that hard.

01:20:26.823 --> 01:20:27.488
            - Okay.

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:28.455
           - alright?

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:30.357
When you do that, you get back,

01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:32.226
       I'll make sure this
      entire house is clean

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:34.428
       and spic and span,
         top to bottom.

01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:35.296
           - Really?

01:20:35.298 --> 01:20:36.163
           - Promise.

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:37.898
       - You're amazing.

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:38.365
           - You are.

01:20:42.438 --> 01:20:43.337
           Hurry up.

01:20:57.587 --> 01:21:00.855
      (tense string music)

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.292
    - I hear around the set

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:08.195
        that you've been
        abusing cocaine.

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:09.129
          There you go.

01:21:13.603 --> 01:21:16.003
    You got a bump for Ebe,
      a little Billy goat?

01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:17.538
         A little toot?

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:20.107
          (rock music)

01:21:21.477 --> 01:21:23.477
     - [Narrator] The bylaw
       officer's curiosity

01:21:23.479 --> 01:21:25.546
  is persistent and potentially

01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:27.214
      fraught with danger.

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:31.085
 - I've been waiting a long
   time to lock this place up.

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:35.623
          (rock music)

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:40.928
what you doing in there, Murph?

01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:42.963
    Probably jerking off with
       that skeevy doctor?

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.266
        Wake up, Murph.

01:21:50.973 --> 01:21:52.106
          Jesus Murphy.

01:21:55.344 --> 01:21:56.577
   You guys knew about this?

01:22:00.449 --> 01:22:02.583
           (screams)

01:22:05.955 --> 01:22:06.987
        - We got a major
       temperature drop.

01:22:06.989 --> 01:22:08.088
        15 degrees down.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:09.456
           Oh my god.

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:12.459
       - Dude its moving,
     its moving on its own.

01:22:12.461 --> 01:22:16.263
       - We got some major
 indexicles happening over here

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:17.598
        with this item.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.000
         - Everything in
       this place is alive

01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:22.603
        and its touching
       this entire house.

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:24.471
      Are you getting this?

01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:28.275
        - Hello, Jurgis.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:29.610
     You got a minute, huh?

01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:32.546
       Murph wouldn't hurt
        a fly, would he?

01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:35.282
        This is all you.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:37.618
  Well I got some news for ya.

01:22:38.688 --> 01:22:41.255
       I got a team down
        there right now.

01:22:41.257 --> 01:22:42.640
  You know what they're doing?

01:22:42.641 --> 01:22:44.024
    They're taking stuff and
   they're putting it outside.

01:22:44.026 --> 01:22:45.426
       They're putting it
      into a god damn bin.

01:22:45.428 --> 01:22:47.962
       And its gonna get
    dragged to a land fill.

01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:50.297
      One thing at a time.

01:22:51.233 --> 01:22:52.099
        Oh look at this.

01:22:52.101 --> 01:22:53.434
              Gone.

01:22:53.436 --> 01:22:54.435
  That thing over there, gone.

01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:56.270
 They're gonna clean it all up,

01:22:56.272 --> 01:22:57.571
        shine it all up.

01:22:57.573 --> 01:23:00.441
     Make it fucking purty.

01:23:00.443 --> 01:23:02.710
        But what's gonna
    happen to Uncle Jurgis?

01:23:02.712 --> 01:23:04.111
              Huh?

01:23:04.113 --> 01:23:05.713
       What's gonna happen
         to you, buddy?

01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:10.217
      Oh I think you might
         just slip away.

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:12.086
            Buh bye

01:23:12.355 --> 01:23:15.089
            (laughs)

01:23:20.730 --> 01:23:22.463
       - Duke, help, Duke!

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:24.999
          I'm trapped.

01:23:26.402 --> 01:23:27.334
               Oh.

01:23:28.204 --> 01:23:30.471
       (eerie tense music)

01:23:30.473 --> 01:23:31.739
              Help!

01:23:35.077 --> 01:23:36.677
           (screaming)

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:39.213
     - Can't take this shit
       with ya, you know?

01:23:41.217 --> 01:23:42.750
      (demonic whispering)

01:23:42.752 --> 01:23:44.284
           But I can.

01:23:44.286 --> 01:23:45.753
            (laughs)

01:23:45.755 --> 01:23:48.756
       (demonic shouting)

01:23:57.266 --> 01:23:58.265
            stop it.

01:23:58.267 --> 01:24:00.167
       What are you doing?

01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:01.335
            Stop it!

01:24:01.337 --> 01:24:06.407
           (shouting)
       (demonic chanting)

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.112
       What are you doing?

01:24:15.618 --> 01:24:17.117
       Sorry, I'm sorry.

01:24:17.119 --> 01:24:18.652
           I'm sorry.

01:24:18.654 --> 01:24:20.054
           I'm sorry.

01:24:20.056 --> 01:24:21.188
           I'm sorry.

01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:24.158
       (demonic chanting)

01:24:26.295 --> 01:24:28.095
           - Oh fuck.

01:24:28.097 --> 01:24:29.663
        Just put it in.

01:24:29.664 --> 01:24:31.230
    All I need to do is fuck
    up my back after today.

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:33.667
     Fucking job from hell.

01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:36.737
   Bodies, fucking bird shit.

01:24:36.739 --> 01:24:38.472
           Holy fuck!

01:24:38.474 --> 01:24:41.075
       Jago, what the fuck
         did you do now?

01:24:41.077 --> 01:24:42.376
              Jago!

01:24:42.378 --> 01:24:43.310
              Jago!

01:24:45.214 --> 01:24:47.281
   - I'm fucking sick of this.

01:24:47.283 --> 01:24:50.284
        Out of my face.

01:24:50.286 --> 01:24:51.952
      (lighthearted music)

01:24:51.953 --> 01:24:53.619
    - [Narrator] The bizarre
 lightness of Sheila's demeanor

01:24:53.622 --> 01:24:56.090
    illustrates a psychotic
       break at the core

01:24:56.092 --> 01:24:57.458
       of this production.

01:25:05.801 --> 01:25:07.434
   - Murph, please come back.

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:08.802
      - I'm done with this.

01:25:08.804 --> 01:25:10.688
  - You've done nothing wrong.

01:25:10.689 --> 01:25:12.573
  You're the only normal person
   in this whole fucking show.

01:25:12.575 --> 01:25:13.841
  - I just don't get the point.

01:25:13.843 --> 01:25:16.110
       - I know, we really
        really messed up

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:18.245
but we're trying to fix things.

01:25:18.247 --> 01:25:19.546
    We need you back there.

01:25:19.548 --> 01:25:22.116
    Come and see what we did
    with the Maitland house

01:25:22.118 --> 01:25:25.652
      and please come back.

01:25:25.654 --> 01:25:27.654
   - Jago, are you down here?

01:25:27.656 --> 01:25:29.590
           Holy shit.

01:25:29.592 --> 01:25:32.259
       (tense eerie music)

01:25:32.261 --> 01:25:33.594
   I found another dead body.

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:36.196
 Somebody killed the bylaw guy.

01:25:38.167 --> 01:25:39.399
    Jago, are you down here?

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:43.203
          (tense music)

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:46.473
              Duke?

01:25:47.676 --> 01:25:49.810
   Jesus motherfucking Christ.

01:25:49.812 --> 01:25:51.411
              Duke!

01:25:51.413 --> 01:25:53.413
        Oh shit, Christ.

01:25:53.415 --> 01:25:54.348
         What the fuck?

01:25:56.619 --> 01:25:58.619
- The junk can move on its own.

01:26:00.623 --> 01:26:03.423
   - Controlled by the uncle?

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:06.293
   - Or does it control him?

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:09.196
  Dude, Ebe was totally right.

01:26:09.198 --> 01:26:12.432
  The uncle and the house have
    a symbiotic relationship.

01:26:12.434 --> 01:26:16.236
        - Chloe, I think
       that this is real.

01:26:16.238 --> 01:26:17.571
       Like really real.

01:26:17.573 --> 01:26:19.239
   Like realer than anything
       we've dealt with.

01:26:19.241 --> 01:26:20.574
        - Oh, for sure.

01:26:20.576 --> 01:26:23.243
        Its 100% real but
      the real question is

01:26:23.245 --> 01:26:26.747
   how much of this stuff was
    bought from dead people?

01:26:26.749 --> 01:26:29.249
       - Well all of it.

01:26:30.452 --> 01:26:33.387
       Yeah, all of it was
      owned by dead people.

01:26:33.389 --> 01:26:35.255
       Its from estates,
       its from auctions.

01:26:35.257 --> 01:26:37.658
   From Salvation Army sales.

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:39.459
   Every piece of furniture,

01:26:39.461 --> 01:26:41.495
    every piece of clothing,

01:26:41.497 --> 01:26:44.932
       every item in this
    house is a monkey's paw.

01:26:44.934 --> 01:26:46.533
      - Cursed possessions.

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:47.834
    - Second hand hauntings.

01:26:48.737 --> 01:26:49.903
        - Jesus, Caleb.

01:26:49.905 --> 01:26:51.889
            - What?

01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:53.874
      - There are thousand
    and thousand of entities

01:26:53.876 --> 01:26:55.209
         in this place.

01:26:55.211 --> 01:26:56.476
          - Thousands?

01:26:56.478 --> 01:26:57.344
        That's too many.

01:26:57.346 --> 01:26:58.612
         What do we do?

01:26:58.614 --> 01:27:01.215
       - They all reside
        in Uncle Jurgis.

01:27:01.217 --> 01:27:02.749
       - What about Murph?

01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:03.650
              - No.

01:27:03.652 --> 01:27:05.219
         He's too pure.

01:27:05.221 --> 01:27:07.254
       He's too simple to
        be controlled by

01:27:07.256 --> 01:27:09.756
         but the uncle,
      that's another story.

01:27:09.758 --> 01:27:11.291
        - Right, right.

01:27:11.293 --> 01:27:14.528
Yeah that's what I was thinking.

01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:16.830
   So what are we doing then?

01:27:16.832 --> 01:27:17.965
       What should we do?

01:27:17.967 --> 01:27:18.966
     I've never experienced
          this before.

01:27:18.968 --> 01:27:21.235
           Have you?
           - Listen.

01:27:22.504 --> 01:27:24.605
   You need to go downstairs

01:27:25.774 --> 01:27:28.375
        and you need to
       kill Uncle Jurgis.

01:27:29.511 --> 01:27:30.510
              And.

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:35.649
       (eerie tense music)

01:27:38.254 --> 01:27:38.852
              Here.

01:27:38.854 --> 01:27:40.787
           Use this.

01:27:41.857 --> 01:27:42.789
           That'll do.

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:47.261
          (eerie music)

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:49.663
               Go.

01:27:49.665 --> 01:27:50.731
         Just kill him.

01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:56.303
    - Yeah, you can do this.

01:27:56.305 --> 01:27:57.638
        You can do this.

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:16.423
   I didn't sign up for this.

01:28:16.425 --> 01:28:18.825
    This is not a paranormal
         investigation.

01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:19.760
           I'm sorry.

01:28:19.762 --> 01:28:22.696
I really do not want to do this,

01:28:22.698 --> 01:28:25.565
          you demonized
       gruesome uncle but.

01:28:28.037 --> 01:28:29.036
        I really don't.

01:28:29.972 --> 01:28:33.040
       (guttural shouting)

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:35.509
           No, uh uh.

01:28:40.516 --> 01:28:42.582
            (roars)

01:28:44.353 --> 01:28:47.421
       (tense eerie music)

01:29:02.638 --> 01:29:04.705
            (roars)

01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:15.949
            - Caleb?

01:29:17.753 --> 01:29:19.820
              Ebe?

01:29:19.822 --> 01:29:21.755
    What are you doing here?

01:29:21.757 --> 01:29:22.923
            - Well.

01:29:22.925 --> 01:29:24.758
We should never have come here.

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.560
   - Its okay, its okay man.

01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:32.699
     - I stole things and I
  reduced the number of things.

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:33.834
    - Its this house, okay?

01:29:33.836 --> 01:29:35.035
     Its got a hold of you.

01:29:35.037 --> 01:29:36.536
   Okay its got a hold of...

01:29:36.538 --> 01:29:39.072
            (grunts)

01:29:39.074 --> 01:29:42.142
       (tense eerie music)

01:29:52.654 --> 01:29:54.688
      - [Narrator] Unknown
        to the showrunner

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:57.457
     and her star, what was
   once a struggle for purpose

01:29:57.459 --> 01:30:00.694
        is now a struggle
       for life and death.

01:30:00.696 --> 01:30:01.628
          - You ready?

01:30:02.831 --> 01:30:04.464
 Wow, this place looks amazing.

01:30:04.466 --> 01:30:07.134
      - Yeah, its starting
    to look bigger already.

01:30:07.136 --> 01:30:08.435
             - Ebe?

01:30:08.437 --> 01:30:09.403
            Falcon?

01:30:11.006 --> 01:30:13.573
       - Where the hells
       everybody anyway?

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:15.976
    - They must be upstairs
        waiting for us.

01:30:15.978 --> 01:30:16.877
           Let's go.

01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:22.883
              Okay.

01:30:27.856 --> 01:30:29.890
           (screams)

01:30:29.892 --> 01:30:31.558
  Get the fuck out of the way.

       (demonic shouting)

01:30:34.897 --> 01:30:36.963
   What the fuck is he doing?

01:30:36.965 --> 01:30:38.765
      - He hasn't been out
      of bed for 30 years.

01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:40.567
  Somebody sure pissed him off.

01:30:40.569 --> 01:30:42.836
           (screaming)

01:30:43.972 --> 01:30:45.839
        - What do we do?

01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:48.775
    - You crazy old bugger.

01:30:51.647 --> 01:30:53.046
           Back off.

01:30:53.048 --> 01:30:55.215
           (roaring)

01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:00.620

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:03.457
           Holy shit.

01:31:03.459 --> 01:31:04.458
            - Shit.

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:05.926

01:31:37.826 --> 01:31:38.758
            - Murph!

01:31:40.095 --> 01:31:41.027
             Murph!

01:31:43.165 --> 01:31:44.097
             Murph.

01:31:45.234 --> 01:31:47.634
      You failed us, Murph.

01:31:47.636 --> 01:31:50.504
       You had one fucking
     job and you failed it.

01:31:50.506 --> 01:31:53.240
  For fucks sakes, you failed.

01:31:53.242 --> 01:31:55.775
   How does it make you feel?

01:31:55.777 --> 01:31:56.710
            Feeling?

01:31:56.712 --> 01:32:00.780
      - Want to see what I
       got at the auction?

01:32:00.782 --> 01:32:02.983
           (gunshot)

01:32:06.989 --> 01:32:08.255
   well how'd you like that?

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:15.061
       (guttural roaring)
          (screaming)

01:32:15.063 --> 01:32:16.296
        - Hey, duchess.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.734
    Measure twice, cut once.

01:32:20.736 --> 01:32:23.537
           (shouting)

01:32:23.539 --> 01:32:24.671
          Die you fuck.

01:32:30.812 --> 01:32:32.112
    And I'm Maltese, bitch.

01:32:32.114 --> 01:32:34.214
         That's why they
       call me the falcon.

01:32:34.216 --> 01:32:35.549
          That's a cut.

01:32:35.551 --> 01:32:37.017
 Lets get the fuck out of here.

01:32:42.958 --> 01:32:44.958
             (roar)

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:47.827
              Ivey?

01:32:49.097 --> 01:32:50.096
          Oh, Charles.

01:32:50.098 --> 01:32:52.165
        - Oh fuck, let's
        get out of here.

01:32:52.968 --> 01:32:54.768
          - Go, go, go.

01:32:56.572 --> 01:32:59.973
     (goofy dramatic music)

01:32:59.975 --> 01:33:01.141
- What are you still doing here?

01:33:01.143 --> 01:33:02.742
            Let's go.
   - Get the hell out of here.

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:03.777
   - What the fuck everybody,

01:33:03.779 --> 01:33:04.644
     what's wrong with you?

01:33:04.646 --> 01:33:05.579
    - Go, go, keep it going.

01:33:05.581 --> 01:33:06.880
- Oh my god, there's no way out.

01:33:06.882 --> 01:33:07.747
              Fuck!

01:33:07.749 --> 01:33:09.249
    Fuck, how do we get out.

01:33:09.251 --> 01:33:10.250
            - Shit.

01:33:10.252 --> 01:33:11.885
       - Fucking help us!

01:33:11.887 --> 01:33:12.886
          - Help, help.

01:33:12.888 --> 01:33:13.753
  - There's no way out of here.

01:33:13.755 --> 01:33:14.921
            (groans)

01:33:14.923 --> 01:33:15.922
           Falcon, no.

01:33:17.125 --> 01:33:18.592
            Falcon.

01:33:18.594 --> 01:33:23.196
           (sobbing)
       (demonic laughter)

01:33:23.198 --> 01:33:25.599
           (roaring)

01:33:27.002 --> 01:33:28.168
           - Fuck you.

01:33:28.170 --> 01:33:30.604
           (gunshots)

01:33:31.773 --> 01:33:33.974
           (roaring)

01:33:53.161 --> 01:33:54.027
          Are you okay?

01:33:54.029 --> 01:33:55.028
       - No, I'm not okay.

01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:56.663
       - Is the show over?

01:33:56.665 --> 01:33:57.664
   - Yeah, the show is over.

01:33:57.666 --> 01:34:01.901
            (roars)
           (screams)

01:34:02.771 --> 01:34:03.903
       What are you doing?

01:34:03.905 --> 01:34:05.672
       - I knew this would
         come in handy.

01:34:05.674 --> 01:34:09.175
     (tense dramatic music)

01:34:09.177 --> 01:34:10.310
        - Hurry, quick.

01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:11.645
       - There, you finish
         the job, okay.

01:34:16.084 --> 01:34:18.718
       (demonic language)

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.121
          (explosions)

01:34:36.738 --> 01:34:37.871
           (coughing)

01:34:37.873 --> 01:34:38.972
        - Are you okay?

01:34:38.974 --> 01:34:40.674
       Its over, its okay.

01:34:41.877 --> 01:34:45.011
      (somber piano music)

01:34:49.418 --> 01:34:51.818
           (sobbing)

01:35:00.395 --> 01:35:03.697
      (somber piano music)

01:35:07.969 --> 01:35:10.036
   - [Narrator] Following the
   explosion and destruction

01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:11.404
     of the Maitland house,

01:35:11.406 --> 01:35:14.174
     Murph consolidated his
      remaining properties

01:35:14.176 --> 01:35:18.244
      and opened an antique
      store on main street.

01:35:18.246 --> 01:35:20.180
        - We're back in
    Rockford after 10 months

01:35:20.182 --> 01:35:22.015
  and I'm here with Murph Evans

01:35:22.017 --> 01:35:24.751
       who has completely
      transformed his life.

01:35:24.753 --> 01:35:26.286
He's sold some of his properties

01:35:26.288 --> 01:35:28.154
   and he was able to reinvest

01:35:28.156 --> 01:35:30.323
in this beautiful antique store.

01:35:30.325 --> 01:35:33.059
     Something that him and
      I designed together,

01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:35.161
 which was a very long process,

01:35:35.163 --> 01:35:36.730
       but so rewarding.

01:35:36.732 --> 01:35:39.933
    Its fantastic what we've
    been able to do together

01:35:39.935 --> 01:35:42.736
         and I'm really
      really proud of him.

01:35:42.738 --> 01:35:44.771
You've done such an amazing job.

01:35:44.773 --> 01:35:46.005
    How do you feel, Murph?

01:35:46.007 --> 01:35:46.873
 - Well I'm feeling just great.

01:35:46.875 --> 01:35:48.174
     I feel like a new man.

01:35:48.176 --> 01:35:49.943
You helped me achieve my dreams,

01:35:49.945 --> 01:35:53.346
  all this stuff now, it can't
    be called junk any more.

01:35:53.348 --> 01:35:56.082
       Its called either
   treasures or merchandise,

01:35:56.084 --> 01:35:59.119
and its all a credit to Sheila.

01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:02.822
       - Thank you, Murph.

01:36:06.328 --> 01:36:09.395
       (tense eerie music)
