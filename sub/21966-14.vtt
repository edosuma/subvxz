00:04.250 --> 00:07.000
Huxley Prescott,

00:04.250 --> 00:07.000
reporting live on this,

00:07.041 --> 00:09.291
the First Day of Spring.

00:09.333 --> 00:12.000
Get up, get out,

00:09.333 --> 00:12.000
turn off your TV and--

00:12.041 --> 00:15.333
No, no, don't do that, not

00:12.041 --> 00:15.333
while I'm on. Bring it with you!

00:15.375 --> 00:20.542
Take your TV out for a glorious

00:15.375 --> 00:20.542
afternoon of non-stop sunshine!

00:20.583 --> 00:24.375
(  ominous theme playing  )

00:24.417 --> 00:27.333
Don't worry,

00:24.417 --> 00:27.333
not even a little rain

00:27.375 --> 00:29.500
can dampen this beautiful day.

00:29.542 --> 00:31.083
( thunder crashes )

00:31.125 --> 00:33.625
Or lightning.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.125
Or even thunder.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.709
MAN:

00:36.166 --> 00:37.709
Mudslide!

00:37.750 --> 00:40.834
Okay, that might just do it.

00:40.875 --> 00:44.291
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

00:44.333 --> 00:47.375
Mudslide at the park!

00:44.333 --> 00:47.375
Kade, are you close?

00:47.417 --> 00:48.625
KADE:

00:47.417 --> 00:48.625
Already on it!

00:48.667 --> 00:50.834
( all yelling )

00:54.208 --> 00:56.542
No need to panic. We got this.

01:05.041 --> 01:06.875
It's still not safe out there.

01:06.917 --> 01:08.083
Get in and wait for backup.

01:08.125 --> 01:10.291
Hey, hey,

01:08.125 --> 01:10.291
I was making rescues

01:10.333 --> 01:11.834
before you set foot

01:10.333 --> 01:11.834
on this planet.

01:11.875 --> 01:13.834
I think I can handle

01:11.875 --> 01:13.834
a little mud.

01:16.875 --> 01:21.208
How about a lot of mud?

Power up and energize!

02:10.792 --> 02:12.333
DANI:

02:10.792 --> 02:12.333
Hang on tight, folks!

02:12.375 --> 02:15.625
Mud. Yuck.

02:12.375 --> 02:15.625
Will they be touching me?

02:18.083 --> 02:21.000
Once again, the Burnses

02:18.083 --> 02:21.000
and the Rescue Bots

02:21.041 --> 02:22.709
save not only the day,

02:22.750 --> 02:26.250
but this reporter's giblets,

02:22.750 --> 02:26.250
from a deadly mudslide!

02:26.291 --> 02:29.417
And for their ongoing

02:26.291 --> 02:29.417
and outstanding work

02:29.458 --> 02:31.208
in protecting Griffin Rock,

02:31.250 --> 02:33.542
the Burns family will be

02:31.250 --> 02:33.542
honored Saturday

02:33.583 --> 02:35.125
with commendations

02:35.166 --> 02:37.750
from the State Emergency

02:35.166 --> 02:37.750
Response Bureau,

02:37.792 --> 02:40.250
with the award ceremony

02:37.792 --> 02:40.250
being photographed

02:40.291 --> 02:42.792
for this month's Emergency

02:40.291 --> 02:42.792
Response Illustrated.

02:42.834 --> 02:45.083
The Lifejacket Edition!

02:45.125 --> 02:48.041
Ooh, this could be the start

02:45.125 --> 02:48.041
of my modeling career.

02:48.083 --> 02:49.417
( scoffs )

02:48.083 --> 02:49.417
Yeah.

02:49.458 --> 02:51.667
Can I go to the mainland

02:49.458 --> 02:51.667
for the ceremony too, Dad?

02:51.709 --> 02:54.333
Of course, son.

02:51.709 --> 02:54.333
You're part of the team.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.542
The Bots won't be

02:54.375 --> 02:56.542
forgotten either,

02:56.583 --> 02:59.709
as Mayor Luskey

02:56.583 --> 02:59.709
has hereby declared Saturday

02:59.750 --> 03:02.583
the start

02:59.750 --> 03:02.583
of Bot Appreciation Week.

03:02.625 --> 03:05.250
I hereby declare Saturday

03:05.291 --> 03:08.083
the start of Bot

03:05.291 --> 03:08.083
Appreciation Week!

03:08.125 --> 03:12.125
Ah. Nice planning. That's

03:08.125 --> 03:12.125
the same day as my photo shoot.

03:12.166 --> 03:15.083
We'll have Bot races,

03:12.166 --> 03:15.083
Pin-the-Tail-on-the-Bot,

03:15.125 --> 03:18.375
a Bot-Dog eating contest.

03:18.417 --> 03:22.000
And at noon, I will

03:18.417 --> 03:22.000
personally present the Bots

03:22.041 --> 03:26.291
and the Burnses with this,

03:22.041 --> 03:26.291
the key to the city.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.709
I was unaware

03:26.333 --> 03:28.709
that the city had a lock.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.583
But I gladly accept

03:28.750 --> 03:30.583
the responsibility

03:30.625 --> 03:33.166
of opening and closing

03:30.625 --> 03:33.166
our town each day.

03:33.208 --> 03:35.583
It's not a real key, Chase.

03:33.208 --> 03:35.583
It's a symbol.

03:35.625 --> 03:37.375
A token of the town's thanks.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.667
Best of all,

03:37.417 --> 03:39.667
everyone who attends

03:39.709 --> 03:43.000
will receive a miniature

03:39.709 --> 03:43.000
Rescue Bot souvenir,

03:43.041 --> 03:47.417
generously donated by me

03:43.041 --> 03:47.417
at great personal expense.

03:47.458 --> 03:49.333
( chuckles )

03:53.792 --> 03:55.875
( grunting )

03:55.917 --> 03:59.667
MAYOR LUSKEY:

03:55.917 --> 03:59.667
Re-elect Mayor Luskey!

03:59.709 --> 04:02.291
( chuckles )

04:02.333 --> 04:05.500
Does my souvenir

04:02.333 --> 04:05.500
make my hips look big?

04:05.542 --> 04:08.333
You guys were all scanned by Doc

04:05.542 --> 04:08.333
Greene's 3D printer, remember?

04:08.375 --> 04:10.500
So those are exact copies.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.834
So you're saying

04:10.542 --> 04:12.834
my hips are big.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.375
It's nice that the mayor

04:12.875 --> 04:15.375
wants to honor us.

04:15.417 --> 04:18.625
What's the point? They still

04:15.417 --> 04:18.625
think we're mindless machines.

04:18.667 --> 04:21.250
They might as well be thanking

04:18.667 --> 04:21.250
their vacuum cleaners.

04:21.291 --> 04:23.583
Uh, the difference is,

04:21.291 --> 04:23.583
Mr. Ungrateful-Head,

04:23.625 --> 04:25.291
that if you programmed it,

04:25.333 --> 04:27.667
a vacuum cleaner could actually

04:25.333 --> 04:27.667
say "you're welcome."

04:27.709 --> 04:31.750
"Ungrateful-Head."

04:27.709 --> 04:31.750
Ha. That's good.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.709
Well, whose idea was it

04:33.750 --> 04:36.041
to schedule both ceremonies

04:33.750 --> 04:36.041
on the same day?

04:36.083 --> 04:37.792
What if we run

04:36.083 --> 04:37.792
into trouble here

04:37.834 --> 04:39.500
while you guys

04:37.834 --> 04:39.500
are on the mainland?

04:39.542 --> 04:41.166
What's the matter,

04:39.542 --> 04:41.166
big guy?

04:41.208 --> 04:43.250
You afraid  can't handle

04:41.208 --> 04:43.250
things on your own?

04:43.291 --> 04:45.125
Hey, hotshot,

04:43.291 --> 04:45.125
we were making rescues

04:45.166 --> 04:47.166
way before we set foot

04:45.166 --> 04:47.166
on your planet.

04:47.208 --> 04:50.041
I think we can handle

04:47.208 --> 04:50.041
an oversized fake key.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.583
Heatwave, we'll only be gone

04:50.083 --> 04:52.583
a couple of hours.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.208
We'll take the Darby Ava

04:52.625 --> 04:55.208
and be back by noon.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.917
Mm-mm.

04:56.959 --> 04:59.208
Which do you guys

04:56.959 --> 04:59.208
think is my best side

04:59.250 --> 05:00.500
for the magazine cover?

05:00.542 --> 05:02.917
ALL:

05:00.542 --> 05:02.917
Your backside.

05:09.417 --> 05:13.542
MAYOR LUSKEY:

05:09.417 --> 05:13.542
Re-elect Mayor Luskey!

05:13.583 --> 05:16.625
( yawns )

05:16.667 --> 05:19.709
Daddy?

05:16.667 --> 05:19.709
What are you still doing up?

05:19.750 --> 05:22.250
Burning the midnight

05:19.750 --> 05:22.250
fossil fuel.

05:22.291 --> 05:25.208
The mayor ordered another

05:22.291 --> 05:25.208
ten crates of souvenirs

05:25.250 --> 05:26.750
for tomorrow.

05:26.792 --> 05:28.583
Why make them one at a time?

05:28.625 --> 05:31.083
Doesn't the 3D Printer

05:28.625 --> 05:31.083
have an automatic setting?

05:31.125 --> 05:34.333
Yes, but I want to keep an eye

05:31.125 --> 05:34.333
on the process.

05:34.375 --> 05:38.250
I'm concerned about the

05:34.375 --> 05:38.250
wear-and-tear on the machine.

05:40.291 --> 05:42.959
I'm concerned about

05:40.291 --> 05:42.959
the wear-and- tear on you.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.500
Let's both get some sleep.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.917
(  ominous theme playing  )

06:01.166 --> 06:04.667
Pssh. What a waste of

06:01.166 --> 06:04.667
a next-gen 3D Printer.

06:04.709 --> 06:06.375
These Minis are useless.

06:06.417 --> 06:08.959
But with a little

06:06.417 --> 06:08.959
creative programming,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.792
we can make them do all kinds

06:09.000 --> 06:11.792
of useful tricks.

06:11.834 --> 06:13.834
( laughing )

06:13.875 --> 06:16.709
( footsteps pattering )

06:19.250 --> 06:23.959
Uh, h-hello? Somebody there?

06:32.583 --> 06:35.208
Weird. Thought I heard...

06:35.250 --> 06:38.083
tiny footsteps?

06:39.333 --> 06:42.166
( chatter )

06:49.291 --> 06:52.000
Blades.

06:49.291 --> 06:52.000
My nose itches.

06:52.041 --> 06:54.583
Nobody moves until Chief is back

06:52.041 --> 06:54.583
to give orders.

06:54.625 --> 06:57.375
That's how vacuum cleaners work,

06:54.625 --> 06:57.375
remember?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.208
( whimpers )

06:59.250 --> 07:01.792
( upbeat music playing )

07:01.834 --> 07:04.208
( crowd applauds )

07:04.250 --> 07:08.542
And with that stirring rendition

07:04.250 --> 07:08.542
of the Griffin Rock Anthem,

07:08.583 --> 07:14.000
we mark the opening day

07:08.583 --> 07:14.000
of Bot Appreciation Week!

07:14.041 --> 07:18.250
And don't forget to pick up

07:14.041 --> 07:18.250
your free Miniature Bot Replicas

07:18.291 --> 07:21.750
from the Re-Elect Mayor Luskey

07:18.291 --> 07:21.750
booth.

07:21.792 --> 07:24.417
They're free.

07:21.792 --> 07:24.417
Did I mention they're free?

07:24.458 --> 07:27.709
( imitating crashing noises )

07:27.750 --> 07:29.792
Look what they're doing to me!

07:29.834 --> 07:32.291
Oh, the horror. The horror!

07:35.208 --> 07:38.667
Humans are certainly creative.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.333
( imitating sirens )

07:41.375 --> 07:45.000
There is nothing creative

07:41.375 --> 07:45.000
about tiny reckless driving.

07:50.417 --> 07:53.125
Sorry this batch is late,

07:50.417 --> 07:53.125
Mr. Mayor.

07:53.166 --> 07:56.500
My 3D printer was behaving

07:53.166 --> 07:56.500
quite strangely.

07:56.542 --> 07:59.041
(  ominous theme playing  )

08:03.250 --> 08:05.667
CHIEF:

08:03.250 --> 08:05.667
Emergency Response Team

08:03.250 --> 08:05.667
of the Month.

08:05.709 --> 08:07.875
That's something to be proud of,

08:05.709 --> 08:07.875
kids.

08:07.917 --> 08:10.250
We'll have to hang this in

08:07.917 --> 08:10.250
the firehouse to show the Bots.

08:10.291 --> 08:13.458
Those folks from the State sure

08:10.291 --> 08:13.458
put on a great ceremony for us.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.834
Well, the plaque's okay,

08:15.875 --> 08:17.375
but that all-you-can-eat shrimp

08:15.875 --> 08:17.375
buffet

08:17.417 --> 08:21.125
made the whole trip worthwhile.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.709
It's all-you-can-eat

08:21.166 --> 08:23.709
while you're there, Kade.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.792
You're not supposed to bring

08:23.750 --> 08:25.792
half of it home with you.

08:25.834 --> 08:29.041
( gulps )

08:29.083 --> 08:32.291
10:45. We should make it back

08:29.083 --> 08:32.291
in plenty of time

08:32.333 --> 08:34.542
for the key presentation.

08:34.583 --> 08:36.792
( rumbling )

08:36.834 --> 08:38.834
What happened to the engine?

08:46.417 --> 08:49.125
Looks like the propeller's

08:46.417 --> 08:49.125
all tangled up in kelp.

08:49.166 --> 08:52.166
This should be a snap.

08:53.375 --> 08:56.208
( grunts )

08:56.250 --> 08:59.458
Oops.

08:56.250 --> 08:59.458
Nice one.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.041
Boulder could just reach down

09:01.083 --> 09:02.875
and rip out the kelp

09:01.083 --> 09:02.875
with one hand.

09:02.917 --> 09:06.834
Well, clearing it ourselves is

09:02.917 --> 09:06.834
going to take a little longer.

09:06.875 --> 09:11.417
Now who do we know

09:06.875 --> 09:11.417
who has a wetsuit on board?

09:20.959 --> 09:25.291
Hurry up, sis. I don't wanna

09:20.959 --> 09:25.291
miss the Bot-Dog eating contest!

09:25.333 --> 09:28.417
Um, actually,

09:25.333 --> 09:28.417
we have bigger problems.

09:28.458 --> 09:30.250
There's a swarm

09:28.458 --> 09:30.250
of poisonous jellyfish

09:30.291 --> 09:31.709
heading straight for Dani!

09:31.750 --> 09:35.417
Dani!

09:31.750 --> 09:35.417
Get up here! Now!

09:35.458 --> 09:37.959
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

09:47.875 --> 09:49.875
ALL:

09:47.875 --> 09:49.875
Dani! Get out of the water!

09:49.917 --> 09:51.917
She can't hear us!

09:49.917 --> 09:51.917
I'm going in!

09:51.959 --> 09:54.083
You'll be stung even worse

09:51.959 --> 09:54.083
without a wetsuit.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.917
I sure wish

09:54.125 --> 09:55.917
the Bots were here.

09:55.959 --> 09:58.667
It's up to us. We have to get

09:55.959 --> 09:58.667
her attention somehow.

09:58.709 --> 10:00.291
The air horn.

10:02.667 --> 10:05.166
( air horn blares )

10:08.291 --> 10:09.583
Mm.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.041
Heave!

10:19.792 --> 10:22.500
( pants )

10:22.542 --> 10:24.959
Whew. Thanks, guys.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.667
MINI BOT:

10:25.000 --> 10:26.667
Re-elect Mayor Luskey!

10:26.709 --> 10:30.417
Uh, free souvenir, yes?

10:26.709 --> 10:30.417
Re-elect me! Here you go.

10:30.458 --> 10:33.250
It's free! There you are. Oh.

10:33.291 --> 10:35.709
Re-elect Mayor Luskey!

10:33.291 --> 10:35.709
One side. Press coming through.

10:35.750 --> 10:40.333
I want a Mini-Boulder!

10:35.750 --> 10:40.333
Eh, for my nephew, of course.

10:43.166 --> 10:46.625
Now the fun begins, bro.

10:46.667 --> 10:49.166
(  ominous theme playing  )

10:56.083 --> 10:59.166
Like I said,

10:56.083 --> 10:59.166
a little reprogramming

10:59.208 --> 11:02.917
gets you all kinds

10:59.208 --> 11:02.917
of useful tricks.

11:29.417 --> 11:33.166
Folks, don't forget

11:29.417 --> 11:33.166
my upcoming presentation

11:33.208 --> 11:37.417
of the key to the city

11:33.208 --> 11:37.417
to the Bots and the Burnses,

11:37.458 --> 11:39.583
who should be here any minute.

11:39.625 --> 11:42.417
DANI:

11:39.625 --> 11:42.417
Never seen so many jellyfish.

11:42.458 --> 11:43.875
How do we get rid of them?

11:43.917 --> 11:45.917
We could really use the Bots'

11:43.917 --> 11:45.917
help right now.

11:45.959 --> 11:48.417
I've been trying to call them,

11:45.959 --> 11:48.417
but there's no answer.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.291
The Com must be out of range.

11:50.333 --> 11:53.709
I radioed a distress call, but

11:50.333 --> 11:53.709
the closest ship is miles away.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.792
We'll just have to wait it out

11:53.750 --> 11:56.792
and hope the jellies move on.

11:56.834 --> 11:59.083
Looks like Heatwave

11:56.834 --> 11:59.083
was right to worry.

11:59.125 --> 12:00.917
We're not going to be back

11:59.125 --> 12:00.917
on time.

12:00.959 --> 12:04.208
Good thing somebody thought

12:00.959 --> 12:04.208
to bring food for the trip.

12:05.667 --> 12:08.000
Shrimp?

12:08.041 --> 12:12.083
Uh. Well, we can't wait

12:08.041 --> 12:12.083
for the Burnses any longer.

12:12.125 --> 12:16.375
The show must go on.

12:12.125 --> 12:16.375
So without further ado,

12:16.417 --> 12:19.875
it is my honor and privilege

12:16.417 --> 12:19.875
as your incumbent--

12:19.917 --> 12:22.000
And up-for-re- election Mayor--

12:22.041 --> 12:25.208
to present to our very own

12:22.041 --> 12:25.208
Rescue Bots

12:25.250 --> 12:29.166
this key to our fair city

12:25.250 --> 12:29.166
of Griffin R--

12:29.208 --> 12:31.333
Whoa. Where did it go?

12:31.375 --> 12:33.667
Someone stole my purse!

12:33.709 --> 12:35.625
My wallet's gone!

12:35.667 --> 12:38.375
The cash box, it's empty!

12:38.417 --> 12:41.875
Breaking news: Bot Appreciation

12:38.417 --> 12:41.875
Week has been stricken

12:41.917 --> 12:44.583
with an outbreak

12:41.917 --> 12:44.583
of mysterious thefts.

12:44.625 --> 12:47.208
( woman screams )

12:44.625 --> 12:47.208
My camera!

12:52.709 --> 12:54.834
Rescue Bots!

12:54.875 --> 12:58.041
Do you understand me?

12:58.083 --> 13:00.333
After that key thief!

13:00.375 --> 13:02.000
That is, find him!

13:02.041 --> 13:05.709
No, no, secure the perimeter.

13:02.041 --> 13:05.709
Search everyone!

13:05.750 --> 13:07.125
Except me.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.667
Round up the usual suspects!

13:09.709 --> 13:11.667
Where is Chief Burns?

13:11.709 --> 13:13.625
Wish he'd make up his mind.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.375
Well, I just made up mine.

13:15.417 --> 13:17.583
No more hiding,

13:15.417 --> 13:17.583
it's time for us to--

13:17.625 --> 13:20.000
Heatwave. We cannot risk

13:17.625 --> 13:20.000
revealing our true natures.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.750
It would only cause

13:20.041 --> 13:21.750
more panic.

13:21.792 --> 13:25.125
Chase is right. No one's

13:21.792 --> 13:25.125
in danger. I say we sit tight.

13:25.166 --> 13:26.917
( growls )

13:26.959 --> 13:30.375
If Dani were here, we'd already

13:26.959 --> 13:30.375
be kicking tail rotor.

13:30.417 --> 13:33.166
Well, she would.

13:30.417 --> 13:33.166
I'd be taking names.

13:33.208 --> 13:35.750
Look! It's the souvenirs!

13:35.792 --> 13:37.375
She's right!

13:37.417 --> 13:40.500
Doc,

13:37.417 --> 13:40.500
what have you done to them?

13:40.542 --> 13:44.500
Me? Nothing!

13:40.542 --> 13:44.500
I-I don't understand.

13:44.542 --> 13:46.125
They must have been

13:44.542 --> 13:46.125
tampered with.

13:46.166 --> 13:50.083
Re-programmed to steal.

13:46.166 --> 13:50.083
But who?

13:50.125 --> 13:53.250
I believe

13:50.125 --> 13:53.250
our work here is done.

13:53.291 --> 13:57.917
I vow to hunt down

13:53.291 --> 13:57.917
whoever is responsible

13:57.959 --> 14:00.625
for these fiendish figurines!

14:00.667 --> 14:03.875
Re-elect Mayor Luskey!

14:06.208 --> 14:11.291
On the other hand, we need to

14:06.208 --> 14:11.291
stay calm and act rationally.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.834
Ahh!

14:12.875 --> 14:16.625
Destroy them! Destroy them all!

14:18.417 --> 14:20.875
MAN:

14:18.417 --> 14:20.875
Fire!

14:20.917 --> 14:23.417
( crowd clamoring )

14:25.208 --> 14:26.959
Dad! Look out!

14:27.000 --> 14:29.333
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

14:33.083 --> 14:34.375
That's it!

14:42.667 --> 14:44.083
Thanks, Heatwave.

14:44.125 --> 14:46.417
Now, Robots, uh,

14:46.458 --> 14:50.166
keep obeying my order

14:46.458 --> 14:50.166
to protect everyone.

14:50.208 --> 14:51.959
Great thinking. Thanks, Frankie.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.041
Complying.

14:55.542 --> 14:57.250
Here. You be Kade.

14:57.291 --> 15:01.458
I know what I'm doing.

14:57.291 --> 15:01.458
That's me being Kade.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.291
It seems like there are

15:01.500 --> 15:04.291
even more of them now.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.750
Graham,

15:04.333 --> 15:06.750
what do jellyfish eat?

15:06.792 --> 15:09.875
Well, small aquatic organisms

15:06.792 --> 15:09.875
primarily.

15:09.917 --> 15:11.792
Plankton, mollusks...

15:13.625 --> 15:14.917
Shrimp?

15:14.959 --> 15:17.458
That's what's been drawing them

15:14.959 --> 15:17.458
to the boat.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.458
Hey!

15:18.500 --> 15:19.917
I am not finished with those.

15:19.959 --> 15:21.542
Sorry, son, but you are now.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.166
Good call, Cody.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.166
With no food,

15:23.208 --> 15:25.333
these jellyfish should

15:23.208 --> 15:25.333
start dispersing right away.

15:25.375 --> 15:28.834
Let's see if I can speed things

15:25.375 --> 15:28.834
along. We have the bait.

15:28.875 --> 15:32.125
All we need is a hook.

15:28.875 --> 15:32.125
And a solid cast,

15:32.166 --> 15:34.125
just like my papa taught me.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.667
( grunts )

15:42.667 --> 15:44.542
( seagull caws )

15:44.583 --> 15:45.875
Nice shot, Dad.

15:45.917 --> 15:48.959
I'll untangle that kelp.

15:45.917 --> 15:48.959
Back in a jiff.

15:51.625 --> 15:55.458
And we'll still be able

15:51.625 --> 15:55.458
to catch some of Bot Day.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.834
At least the tail end.

16:02.041 --> 16:04.875
Ha, ha, ha. They'll be cleaning

16:02.041 --> 16:04.875
up that mess for hours.

16:04.917 --> 16:09.041
Which means

16:04.917 --> 16:09.041
it's time for Phase Two.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.125
Blaze contained.

16:11.166 --> 16:13.417
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

16:13.458 --> 16:15.166
But perpetrators still active.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.625
And extremely messy.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.792
Will you hold still?

16:29.709 --> 16:32.500
( grunts )

16:41.834 --> 16:43.667
( grunts )

16:45.917 --> 16:48.417
( ropes tying )

16:53.583 --> 16:56.208
What on earth?

16:56.250 --> 16:58.417
A Lilliputian revolution.

16:58.458 --> 17:01.417
Apparently, someone reprogrammed

16:58.458 --> 17:01.417
my 3D Printer.

17:01.458 --> 17:05.667
And turned the souvenirs

17:01.458 --> 17:05.667
into mini klepto-bots.

17:05.709 --> 17:08.917
Look! Where are those bots going

17:05.709 --> 17:08.917
in such a big hurry?

17:08.959 --> 17:12.125
How about we follow them

17:08.959 --> 17:12.125
and find out?

17:12.166 --> 17:14.625
(  action theme playing  )

17:14.667 --> 17:16.542
About time you showed up.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.375
We really needed you guys today.

17:18.417 --> 17:20.458
Especially after Kade's

17:18.417 --> 17:20.458
shrimp-a-thon.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.250
Shrimp-a-what?

17:22.291 --> 17:25.917
It's not important.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.917
Just, let's-- Let's move.

17:25.959 --> 17:28.542
Good to have you back, partner.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.709
Aw, I missed you too.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.667
Not the flying so much,

17:30.750 --> 17:34.667
but you, yes.

17:39.583 --> 17:40.875
Chase? Is that...?

17:40.917 --> 17:43.166
Ketchup. A lengthy story.

17:43.208 --> 17:45.500
(  ominous theme playing  )

18:06.166 --> 18:09.542
Happy Bot Appreciation Week,

18:06.166 --> 18:09.542
bro.

18:09.583 --> 18:11.834
I sure appreciate

18:09.583 --> 18:11.834
these Bots.

18:11.875 --> 18:13.125
( laughing )

18:17.750 --> 18:20.417
Well, I'll be.

18:20.458 --> 18:21.959
Now the question is,

18:22.000 --> 18:26.417
who are these little outlaws

18:22.000 --> 18:26.417
working for?

18:26.458 --> 18:29.333
I should've guessed.

18:26.458 --> 18:29.333
Evan and Myles.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.917
Let's move in, team.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.208
( whimpering )

18:38.375 --> 18:40.208
Not now, dude.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.792
I'm trying to count our take.

18:41.834 --> 18:44.625
Attention, perpetrators.

18:41.834 --> 18:44.625
Exit the vehicle peacefully,

18:44.667 --> 18:47.458
with your hands in the air.

18:47.500 --> 18:51.917
We're not going down without

18:47.500 --> 18:51.917
a fight. Attack mode!

18:51.959 --> 18:54.458
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

18:58.291 --> 18:59.625
Incoming at 3 o'clock!

19:03.375 --> 19:05.417
Way to knock off

19:03.375 --> 19:05.417
those knockoffs.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.041
Thanks for the heads-up.

19:09.625 --> 19:12.458
DANI:

19:09.625 --> 19:12.458
Steady. Steady.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.750
Now!

19:22.500 --> 19:24.583
Whoa.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.375
( siren wailing )

19:26.417 --> 19:29.500
You have the right

19:26.417 --> 19:29.500
to remain silent.

19:31.166 --> 19:33.291
Frankly, we would prefer it.

19:33.333 --> 19:36.583
Time to power down

19:33.333 --> 19:36.583
those half-pint perps.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.792
( powering down )

19:40.834 --> 19:42.959
And with a little re-programming

19:40.834 --> 19:42.959
from Doc,

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
maybe we can reform them.

19:46.041 --> 19:48.125
(  triumphant theme playing  )

19:48.166 --> 19:50.667
( chatter )

19:58.667 --> 20:01.041
This is Huxley Prescott

20:01.083 --> 20:04.166
resuming live coverage

20:01.083 --> 20:04.166
of Bot Appreciation Week

20:04.208 --> 20:07.208
with a just-returned HoverCam.

20:26.166 --> 20:29.125
Thanks to the efforts

20:26.166 --> 20:29.125
of the Burns family

20:29.166 --> 20:32.959
and the Rescue Bots,

20:29.166 --> 20:32.959
I can finally present them all

20:33.000 --> 20:35.750
with the key to the city.

20:35.792 --> 20:38.583
One thing I don't understand,

20:35.792 --> 20:38.583
Chief.

20:38.625 --> 20:41.041
How are the Bots able

20:38.625 --> 20:41.041
to do so much

20:41.083 --> 20:43.291
without you Burnses

20:41.083 --> 20:43.291
to command them?

20:43.333 --> 20:45.458
Well, I'm certain it was your

20:43.333 --> 20:45.458
clear-headed leadership,

20:45.500 --> 20:47.959
Mr. Mayor.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.959
Ah. Yes.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.250
Ha, ha. Of course.

20:50.291 --> 20:54.500
And I plan to continue

20:50.291 --> 20:54.500
those leadership skills

20:54.542 --> 20:55.959
in my next term.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.417
Thank you, Mayor Luskey.

20:57.458 --> 21:00.041
Today was a powerful reminder

21:00.083 --> 21:01.709
that a team performs best

21:01.750 --> 21:04.417
when all of its members

21:01.750 --> 21:04.417
work together.

21:06.291 --> 21:09.333
And I, for one, appreciate

21:06.291 --> 21:09.333
every single one of them,

21:09.375 --> 21:11.375
Bot and Burns alike.

21:11.417 --> 21:14.291
And what better way

21:11.417 --> 21:14.291
to show our thanks

21:14.333 --> 21:16.291
and remind the voters

21:14.333 --> 21:16.291
of Griffin Rock

21:16.333 --> 21:19.375
to re-elect yours truly...

21:21.417 --> 21:26.291
than with this lavish

21:21.417 --> 21:26.291
all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet?

21:26.333 --> 21:28.250
I love this job.

21:29.542 --> 21:32.208
Got my vote.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.834
(  ominous theme playing  )
