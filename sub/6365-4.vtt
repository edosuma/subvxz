WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.069
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
Give your baby your name.

00:04.071 --> 00:05.604
I have to open my heart,
and our marriage

00:05.606 --> 00:07.139
Will be stronger for it.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.073
You should leave this house.

00:08.075 --> 00:09.375
I can't leave my family.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.276
Narcisse:
We found the girl. Her family

00:11.278 --> 00:12.344
Were dying of the plague.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.346
Estelle?

00:14.348 --> 00:17.483
I went to see leith.
I have been wondering
about your loyalty.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.351
You chose me knowing
that I'd loved another.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.286
I didn't know how it would feel.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.222
Will you be back?
I don't know.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.358
Little girl:
<i>So much suffering.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:27.726
There will be a reckoning.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.231
(sheep bleating)
walk up, walk up. Walk up.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.133
Get back here, riley!

00:34.135 --> 00:36.135
(barking)
where are you going,
you blasted dog?

00:36.137 --> 00:37.403
(dog yelps)

00:37.405 --> 00:41.106
(thunder crashing)
(horses neighing)

00:41.108 --> 00:44.043
(neighs, snorts)

00:44.045 --> 00:45.644
Who are you?

00:45.646 --> 00:47.379
(thunder crashing)
(neighing)

00:47.381 --> 00:49.448
What do you want?

00:49.450 --> 00:51.183
(neighing)

00:52.385 --> 00:53.719
(neighing)

00:55.155 --> 00:56.655
Catherine:
<i>For your brother</i>

00:56.657 --> 00:58.657
Henry's christening

00:58.659 --> 01:01.627
The sweets were drizzled
in the thinnest layer

01:01.629 --> 01:03.362
Of gold, everything shimmered.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.798
Oh, the children loved it.
I remember.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.800
That's what you thought
made little claude throw up.

01:07.802 --> 01:10.069
All those gold flecks
splattered everywhere.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.738
She was, in fact,
drunk on wine.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.741
She's probably drunk in prague
as we speak.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.743
What about your other
sister for godmother?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.378
Elisabeth, she's
a queen consort

01:19.380 --> 01:21.580
Of a good catholic nation.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.582
Exactly. She
lives in Spain.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.751
Lola, do you have
any thoughts

01:25.753 --> 01:27.686
On who should be your
child's godparents?

01:27.688 --> 01:29.254
We've already discussed
this with lola.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.722
All her kin are
back in scotland.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.558
The choice of
godparent

01:32.560 --> 01:36.328
For a royal offspring,
even an illegitimate one,

01:36.330 --> 01:39.164
Is more than an honor.
We are speaking about

01:39.166 --> 01:40.699
Who would raise my grandson
in the event

01:40.701 --> 01:42.568
That neither francis
nor lola could.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.203
I've offered

01:44.205 --> 01:46.138
And been denied.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.373
We have a long history
of reasons why.

01:48.375 --> 01:49.741
Francis:
As for the party,
I'm not sure

01:49.743 --> 01:51.643
That we need
such an elaborate affair.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.879
The church service
will suffice.
You wanted

01:53.881 --> 01:55.581
To publicly claim your son,

01:55.583 --> 01:57.349
To honor him
so that others

01:57.351 --> 01:58.750
Would do the same
as he grows up.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.752
This is how it's done.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.454
Well done avoiding
the whole thing.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.456
Few queens have ever
attended the christenings

02:04.458 --> 02:06.625
Of their husband's bastards.
I say that

02:06.627 --> 02:09.261
With growing affection
for my grandson.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.469
Mary:
Don't be angry.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.738
At least not
with francis.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.607
When it comes
to planning a party,

02:21.609 --> 02:23.375
Catherine dominates us all.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.377
Mary, I've been thinking,

02:25.379 --> 02:27.613
And perhaps what's best
is that we're not underfoot.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.348
We've discussed this.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.250
Francis wants to be able
to parent his son.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.618
What about
the east cottage?

02:32.620 --> 02:34.520
It's on the grounds
but separate.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.388
Is that what you want?

02:36.390 --> 02:37.890
To be away from us all?

02:37.892 --> 02:39.758
Wouldn't it be easier
for you?

02:39.760 --> 02:42.661
Less awkward?
I suppose.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.530
But are you sure
this isn't about you?

02:44.532 --> 02:46.532
Have I done anything
to make you feel uncomfortable?

02:46.534 --> 02:50.369
I worry that you will come
to resent me and my son.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.938
I would never resent a child.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.507
Lola, the time
for anger is past.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.443
But you never really got angry
with me, did you?

02:59.779 --> 03:02.347
I don't know how you managed it.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.882
And now...

03:03.884 --> 03:06.285
I-it's just my worry
for anything weighing on you,

03:06.287 --> 03:09.221
When you and francis
are still so new to the throne.

03:09.223 --> 03:12.558
There's a room that makes
a perfect nursery,

03:12.560 --> 03:14.560
Bedrooms for the nannies
and servants.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.195
You've already chosen the place.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.197
It's a-a stone's throw
from the castle.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.831
Adjacent, actually.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.301
Then what do you gain from this?

03:22.303 --> 03:24.636
Some distance.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.838
And this distance,
short as it is,

03:26.840 --> 03:29.541
What of your duties to me
as one of my ladies?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.410
I...

03:31.412 --> 03:33.812
I suppose, if you want
to release me...

03:34.781 --> 03:36.548
You are released.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.749
Mary, I...
It's fine.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.818
Excuse me.

03:43.923 --> 03:45.591
So, you're not just here
for the christening, louis?

03:45.593 --> 03:48.460
Not this day, though
I appreciate the invitation.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.529
How long have you kept
a place in the village?

03:50.531 --> 03:52.397
Since my father sold his
last spring.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.466
I'm well-known there.
People talk to me.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.469
Which is how you heard
of this shepherd being menaced.

03:57.471 --> 04:00.472
By horsemen
with "hands as cold as ice."

04:00.474 --> 04:03.575
It's the stuff of legends, the
kind of story which spreads,

04:03.577 --> 04:05.811
Which is why I thought
you should know.
Ah.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.246
Did they hurt him?

04:07.248 --> 04:08.714
I haven't spoken with him.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.849
What they did to him
or what they wanted is unclear.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.851
But people are afraid.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.721
There's talk of restless
spirits, empty graves.

04:15.723 --> 04:18.590
My brother is the king's deputy.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.325
Go with him to talk to this man.

04:20.327 --> 04:23.395
I'd be honored to be of service,
your majesty.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.735
Leith bayard,
I'm glad you have returned.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.570
I'm sorry
for the loss

04:31.572 --> 04:34.306
Of your lands.
It could not be avoided.

04:34.308 --> 04:37.743
I assumed as much,
as they went to lord narcisse.

04:37.745 --> 04:41.947
We'll share a draft or ten
and I'll explain.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.949
As I have no
other holdings

04:43.951 --> 04:46.351
To offer at the moment, I'd like
to give you a position at court.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.620
You could help my brother.
He needs good men

04:48.622 --> 04:50.022
That he can trust.

04:50.024 --> 04:52.491
Thank you, your majesty.

04:52.493 --> 04:55.360
In moments like this,
I hope you can call me friend.

04:57.363 --> 04:59.498
(rattling)
(lola and greer chuckle)

04:59.500 --> 05:01.333
These are lovely. Thank you.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.567
The colors
of scotland.

05:02.569 --> 05:03.969
We tried for
something subtle.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.504
Your side needs to be
represented somehow.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.805
Mary would agree.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.307
(horse neighing)

05:14.047 --> 05:15.714
Greer:
Is that lord narcisse?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.449
Mary says he's poisonous
and cruel.

05:17.451 --> 05:21.453
My word, I know that girl.
Her family took me in.

05:21.455 --> 05:24.423
They perished of
plague and narcisse
took her away in a cage.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.091
In a cage?
He said it was
to isolate her,

05:26.093 --> 05:28.794
In case
she was infected herself.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.532
Estelle, is
that really you?

05:33.534 --> 05:35.067
Narcisse:
Lady lola.

05:35.069 --> 05:36.702
I nearly forgot
you'd met my bride

05:36.704 --> 05:38.804
During your sojourn from
the castle with our young king.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.573
And you are?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.809
I'm greer of kinross.
This is lady kenna.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.745
Did you say "my bride"?
Yes.

05:46.747 --> 05:50.082
We've come to ask the king for
his blessing a bit belatedly.

05:50.084 --> 05:52.684
I would have done so in advance
of our marriage, but

05:52.686 --> 05:55.487
It wasn't proper,
estelle staying beneath my roof.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.557
I honor a women's reputation.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.825
Estelle:
When I learned

05:59.827 --> 06:02.027
We were coming to court,
I was hoping to see you.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.095
On the off chance,

06:03.097 --> 06:04.563
I made you a gift.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.398
Ah.
It's nothing much,

06:06.400 --> 06:09.501
Just a handkerchief
I've fancied up a bit.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.136
Narcisse:
Come, estelle.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.875
Greer:
Her hands were shaking.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.610
She's a nervous little bird.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.679
What got her
so scared?

06:20.681 --> 06:23.482
Narcisse or being
introduced to the king?

06:23.484 --> 06:26.385
It's narcisse.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.453
Greer:
"help me."

06:31.057 --> 06:33.625
Francis:
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.494
I wanted to make sure
that you're all right

06:35.496 --> 06:38.697
With my mother's grand plans
for the christening,

06:38.699 --> 06:40.098
With everything.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.135
I was just looking at our home.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.637
We had such fun
playing here

06:45.639 --> 06:47.672
When we were children.
Do you remember?

06:47.674 --> 06:48.840
Of course.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.042
So many places to run and hide.

06:51.044 --> 06:54.946
I learned how to climb
in that tree over there.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.548
And you learned how
to pitch apples at me

06:56.550 --> 06:58.150
From over the seawall.

06:58.152 --> 07:00.085
It's wide open,

07:00.087 --> 07:02.988
With a gentle
slope that could...

07:02.990 --> 07:04.990
Propel one, if you were...

07:04.992 --> 07:07.926
Say learning how to walk.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.797
You aren't...

07:11.799 --> 07:13.498
I am.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.867
It's been some weeks now,
but I wanted to be sure.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.035
And I am sure.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.737
I am with child,

07:18.739 --> 07:20.972
Our child at last.
(chuckles)

07:22.642 --> 07:25.444
(mary laughs)

07:41.093 --> 07:43.628
(soft panting, moaning)

07:46.165 --> 07:48.667
I don't think I've been
this happy in my entire life.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.102
(both chuckle)

07:53.940 --> 07:56.675
How did you manage to keep it
a secret from me for six weeks?

07:56.677 --> 07:58.677
I didn't want it to interfere
with the coronation

07:58.679 --> 08:00.512
Or the christening.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.548
And it's still very early.
Catherine: Good morning!

08:03.550 --> 08:05.750
How is the happy trinity?
No!

08:05.752 --> 08:07.152
Don't come in!
Father, mother,

08:07.154 --> 08:08.987
Unborn son.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.989
Oh, I'm hoping for a son.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.091
Plenty of time
for daughters later.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.093
How could you possibly know?

08:15.095 --> 08:17.028
I'm familiar with
the condition,

08:17.030 --> 08:18.897
And I've had
my eye on you.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.899
Your waist, it's tiny as
ever, though a bit queasy

08:20.901 --> 08:23.535
Here and there,
no? Also,

08:23.537 --> 08:25.804
A few weeks ago
I had your chamber pot tested.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.239
It's the usual
exam. It's...

08:27.241 --> 08:30.075
Horse urine and wine.
It's very reliable.

08:30.077 --> 08:33.044
And yesterday one of my
ladies, she was very touched

08:33.046 --> 08:36.982
By your rather joyous embrace
at the water's edge.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.718
You've been having
your spies follow us.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.920
I was being discreet.
I was waiting

08:41.922 --> 08:44.789
To let you be the
one to tell francis.

08:44.791 --> 08:47.058
Francis.
Mother, I thought that we might
keep it a secret for now.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.528
Nonsense. This
child strengthens

08:49.530 --> 08:52.731
Mary's position as an
heir-producing catholic,

08:52.733 --> 08:55.000
Which, in turn,
strengthens her claim,

08:55.002 --> 08:56.902
France's claim,
to the throne.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.971
English throne. As long as
that protestant elizabeth

08:59.973 --> 09:02.607
Remains barren and unmarried,

09:02.609 --> 09:04.843
You are a better option.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.011
Enter!

09:06.013 --> 09:07.679
T... Uh...

09:10.883 --> 09:13.552
Ah. Skin tonics

09:13.554 --> 09:15.287
From cairo.

09:15.289 --> 09:16.988
And food to help aid

09:16.990 --> 09:18.990
In the baby's
development.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.158
And...

09:20.160 --> 09:22.594
Sage to ward off
restless spirits.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.963
There are many in the castle
after the plague.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.198
Pregnant women
are particularly vulnerable.

09:28.167 --> 09:31.036
Tell me again how happy you are.

09:31.038 --> 09:34.272
I don't think I have ever
been this... (groans)

09:34.274 --> 09:36.908
Your figure's gonna
go to hell anyway, so
you might as well eat up.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.643
You are feeding

09:38.645 --> 09:41.046
The future king of France.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.850
Kenna:
I can't believe it!

09:45.852 --> 09:47.252
Greer:
Oh, this is wonderful.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.753
Lola:
When did you find out?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.121
Mary:
I've known for a few weeks,

09:50.123 --> 09:51.323
But I wanted to be sure.

09:51.325 --> 09:53.792
I only told francis today.
(giggles)

09:53.794 --> 09:55.260
Champagne?

09:55.262 --> 09:56.895
I wanted to share
my good fortune.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.630
A toast. To mary.

09:58.632 --> 10:01.333
May we all be as lucky
and fortunate in love.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.605
(laughing)
let's get you
some more.

10:09.075 --> 10:11.209
Have you heard
from castleroy?

10:11.211 --> 10:14.346
Only the most formal
and evasive responses
to my letters.

10:14.348 --> 10:16.748
I don't know where we
stand with each another.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.049
You, however,

10:18.051 --> 10:19.918
You're going to
get through this.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.786
You will find
love again.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.021
And now that
your son

10:23.023 --> 10:24.356
Has been publicly
claimed by the king,

10:24.358 --> 10:25.890
You're raised
in station.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.993
But no longer one
of mary's ladies.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.963
We keep trying to be
our best selves,

10:31.965 --> 10:34.699
But it's difficult,
given the circumstances.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.668
The child...

10:36.670 --> 10:38.103
What I know
people must think.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.838
That you're the
king's mistress.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.974
Those who matter
know you aren't.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.110
It won't help my chances
at marrying again.

10:45.112 --> 10:48.079
Men will be terrified
of angering the king.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.649
(sighs) not that I'm in
a rush to wed. Except...

10:50.651 --> 10:53.251
It's only through marriage
that we have any standing.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.387
Our own homes.
Access to money.

10:55.389 --> 10:56.788
And, one hopes,

10:56.790 --> 10:58.690
Some control over
our own lives.

10:58.692 --> 10:59.858
I shouldn't
complain.

10:59.860 --> 11:00.992
Especially
when there are

11:00.994 --> 11:03.261
So many sad stories
after the plague.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.931
Estelle's
plea for help.

11:06.933 --> 11:10.335
Perhaps her story can
have a happier ending.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.071
(sheep bleating, cattle mooing)

11:13.073 --> 11:14.739
Thanks, love.

11:16.909 --> 11:19.444
I can't seem
to get warm.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.146
You said there were
three riders.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.881
But you can't identify
any of them?

11:22.883 --> 11:24.049
They were cloaked,

11:24.051 --> 11:25.283
So I couldn't see their faces.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.152
Don't know if
they had any.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.920
They rode right out of
the storm and grabbed me.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.955
Their hands were as cold as ice.

11:31.891 --> 11:33.324
Thank you.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.027
Go on.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.162
I was sure they were
going to kill me,

11:37.164 --> 11:38.163
But they let me live.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.832
They offered me... A gift.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.367
What kind of gift?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.936
A mark,

11:44.938 --> 11:46.304
To protect me and my family.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.473
A mark to help
us prosper.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.041
But they wanted
something in return.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.376
My faith.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.944
They wanted me
to renounce god.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.379
But I said no.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.448
I said no, I swear I did,

11:56.450 --> 11:58.116
And I ran and I ran...

11:58.118 --> 12:00.051
Did you ever see them again?
No.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.252
But there's others
tell the same story.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.121
The same mark.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.823
The same price.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.357
They wanted my soul,

12:06.359 --> 12:07.759
But I wouldn't
give it them.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.094
But what if
others did?

12:09.096 --> 12:11.196
What happens to a man
without a soul?

12:11.198 --> 12:12.964
What's he capable of?

12:17.503 --> 12:19.237
Estelle:
<i>Oh, lola. You came.</i>

12:19.239 --> 12:21.239
I received
your message.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.742
Estelle, I'm not sure
I can help you if...
Set me free

12:23.744 --> 12:25.510
From lord narcisse.

12:29.515 --> 12:31.249
Why did you marry him?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.518
I'd lost everything
and everyone.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.320
With my family dead,

12:35.322 --> 12:36.921
He said that marriage
was the only way

12:36.923 --> 12:38.123
To keep our lands.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.324
But since
we married...

12:39.326 --> 12:40.925
Yes?

12:40.927 --> 12:42.127
I've heard stories

12:42.129 --> 12:43.328
About the wives before me.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.529
Horrible things.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.930
From whom?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.532
Members of
his household.

12:47.534 --> 12:51.169
They say he forced himself
on his first wife

12:51.171 --> 12:53.371
So soon after she miscarried
that she bled to death.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.306
Oh, my god.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.408
Another wife was found
unconscious, repeatedly,

12:57.410 --> 12:59.144
In pools of her own blood.

13:00.546 --> 13:04.816
But has narcisse
been abusive to you?

13:04.818 --> 13:06.851
In any way?

13:06.853 --> 13:09.988
We haven't... Consummated.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.824
I've turned him
away, so far.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.392
But I'm running out of excuses

13:14.394 --> 13:16.494
And he's impatient.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.363
What will he do to me, when...

13:20.032 --> 13:21.533
You're my only hope.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.134
The most powerful woman I know.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.302
The king's mistress.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.838
Uh...
You gave him a son.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.274
If anyone can
help me, you can.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.842
Please.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.812
Save me from lord narcisse.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.416
Kenna:
It'll be a beautiful ceremony
for lola's child.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.018
So much better,

13:40.020 --> 13:41.486
Now that mary's carrying
a baby of her own.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.256
There he is.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.424
Greer, tell me
the truth.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.926
Is there any version
of this life

13:47.928 --> 13:49.427
Where you and leith
could be together?

13:49.429 --> 13:50.929
My sisters need me
to make a good marriage,

13:50.931 --> 13:52.463
Their own prospects
depend on it.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.033
What if they were as clever
and resourceful as you?

13:55.035 --> 13:57.902
What if they found love,
a good man, a wealthy man,

13:57.904 --> 14:00.004
And then you were free to
marry the man you desire?

14:00.006 --> 14:02.440
I can't be ruled
by desire.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.042
It's nothing to build
a life on.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.244
Isn't it?
You and bash.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.580
If I have to hear one
more tale of the two of you

14:08.582 --> 14:10.448
Knocking your bed
through the floor.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.350
Well, the floor is made
of stone, mercifully.
(laughs)

14:12.352 --> 14:14.619
Although we have nearly
cracked the bed in two.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.087
(both laugh)

14:16.089 --> 14:17.455
You can't
underestimate passion.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.857
It's what brought
us together.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.491
The king forced
you together.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.061
Yes, and then we explored
what was between us.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.396
We were forced to be
together anyway.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.365
What a surprising
journey that was.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.868
My point is,

14:29.870 --> 14:31.236
You are driven by
passion, greer.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.937
Even more than me,
you are.

14:32.939 --> 14:35.006
You should recognize
that in yourself now,

14:35.008 --> 14:36.207
So you're not
surprised later

14:36.209 --> 14:38.176
When desire edges
out reason.

14:44.450 --> 14:47.218
Lola:
<i>Estelle fears for her life.</i>

14:47.220 --> 14:49.254
A life that may be filled
with the worst form of torture

14:49.256 --> 14:50.622
At the hands of her husband.

14:50.624 --> 14:53.324
Opposing narcisse has
become a bad habit,

14:53.326 --> 14:55.560
Dangerous even
when we're right.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.029
But, lola, these are
just stories, rumor.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.664
Mary:
If estelle was mistreated,

14:59.666 --> 15:01.900
Then we could
intervene.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.168
Estelle has had everything
taken away from her,

15:04.170 --> 15:06.504
Her family,
her home,

15:06.506 --> 15:09.040
And now she's forced into a life
she doesn't want or deserve,

15:09.042 --> 15:11.976
Based on one moment of weakness.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.116
Francis...

15:19.318 --> 15:21.052
...Could you give us
a moment alone, please?

15:25.457 --> 15:27.058
(door opens)

15:27.060 --> 15:28.526
(door closes)

15:28.528 --> 15:30.395
I understand how
you're feeling, I do.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.131
There was a time I thought
my life was not my own.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.933
Because you were willing
to marry for scotland,

15:34.935 --> 15:36.935
When things seemed
impossible with francis.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.269
You were going to wed
the son of portugal,

15:38.271 --> 15:39.470
Whom we all knew
to be cruel.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.339
Yes.
But you didn't.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.540
Because we, your friends,

15:42.542 --> 15:44.075
Did everything we could
to save you.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.277
You prove
your arguments

15:46.279 --> 15:47.679
With events
that never took place.

15:47.681 --> 15:49.681
And now, I fear your happiness

15:49.683 --> 15:51.282
Has come to undermine
your compassion.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.152
My compassion is for you.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.523
As it is yours
that rules you in this moment.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.024
Your cage is invisible,

16:00.026 --> 16:01.492
But you feel it
just the same.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.494
And has it ever occurred to you

16:03.496 --> 16:05.496
That your cage is of
your own making?

16:05.498 --> 16:08.166
That the bars formed
the minute you decided

16:08.168 --> 16:10.568
To sleep with the man
that I love, knowing that

16:10.570 --> 16:12.704
I loved him still?
There it is.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.439
The anger I knew you bore me.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.441
How long have you been
waiting for it to come out?

16:16.443 --> 16:17.976
For me to lash
out at you,

16:17.978 --> 16:20.611
So I would feel
as guilty as you should?

16:20.613 --> 16:22.046
But I don't.

16:22.048 --> 16:24.482
I kept your secret.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.184
I protected you.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.652
I have been a good
and loyal friend

16:27.654 --> 16:29.187
And what were you?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.522
It was one night.
I made a mistake...

16:31.524 --> 16:32.724
It was a choice.

16:32.726 --> 16:34.993
We all make choices.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.260
We don't all
have choices.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.229
I don't, not anymore.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.398
Estelle doesn't.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.599
You do, and you always will,

16:41.601 --> 16:43.234
Because you are a queen.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.469
And to a queen, what
are the problems

16:44.471 --> 16:45.770
Of one
village girl?

16:45.772 --> 16:48.139
Or of a girl who used
to be your friend?

16:48.141 --> 16:49.674
Lola!

16:51.076 --> 16:53.277
Don't you turn
your back on me.

16:53.279 --> 16:55.246
I am more than your friend.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.749
I am your queen.

17:00.519 --> 17:04.322
Is there something I left out,
your majesty?

17:05.557 --> 17:07.325
You were right.

17:07.327 --> 17:10.061
It would be good
if you were housed elsewhere...

17:10.063 --> 17:13.131
The better to keep you
out of my sight.

17:17.469 --> 17:19.670
(door closes)

17:28.047 --> 17:29.380
I've made arrangements
to have you taken

17:29.382 --> 17:30.748
Far from court and narcisse.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.084
You don't know what
this means to me.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.585
I know what it feels
like to be trapped,

17:34.587 --> 17:37.455
And to have no one to turn to.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.557
Tonight, when everyone's
occupied at the ball,

17:39.559 --> 17:42.293
Can you get away
and meet me in my chambers?

17:42.295 --> 17:44.095
If we're to succeed,

17:44.097 --> 17:46.164
We must exercise the utmost
caution, do you understand?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.565
I do.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.168
I'll be careful, I promise.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.574
â™ª

18:04.783 --> 18:06.417
If this is your mother's idea

18:06.419 --> 18:08.152
Of a "small" banquet
before the christening,

18:08.154 --> 18:11.823
Can you imagine what
the actual event will be like?

18:11.825 --> 18:13.825
You look more beautiful
than ever.

18:13.827 --> 18:17.395
A common affect, I've heard,
when a woman is with child,

18:17.397 --> 18:19.697
But you are
uncommonly desirable.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.833
Until I balloon to
the size of a plough horse.

18:21.835 --> 18:23.301
According to
your mother,

18:23.303 --> 18:25.136
That is also a common affect

18:25.138 --> 18:26.637
Among scottish women.

18:28.307 --> 18:29.574
Something wrong?

18:29.576 --> 18:31.309
I'm looking for lola.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.144
We had an argument
and it went too far.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.313
But it's nothing to
concern yourself with.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.181
I'll leave you
to your affairs.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.117
And the giant
butter sculpture.

18:41.753 --> 18:43.688
We spoke with
the shepherd,

18:43.690 --> 18:45.890
Who claims that he was set upon
by three cloaked riders.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.859
He says they offered
protection

18:47.861 --> 18:49.360
For him and his flock

18:49.362 --> 18:51.429
In exchange for his soul.
I'm not sure

18:51.431 --> 18:53.831
A man's soul is his to give.
Conde smells fraud.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.766
He thinks someone
has a mind to spread terror.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.235
Who?

18:57.237 --> 18:58.636
Maybe catholics,

18:58.638 --> 19:00.438
Trying to make protestants
reek of the devil.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.173
You think there's more to it?

19:02.175 --> 19:04.876
It's nothing I want
to burden you with.

19:04.878 --> 19:07.345
Especially
not on a day

19:07.347 --> 19:08.880
When you find out
you're going to be

19:08.882 --> 19:11.482
A father twice over.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.518
I heard from kenna, but your
mother's telling everyone.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.387
Well, if these cloaked riders

19:16.389 --> 19:17.889
Really are the henchmen of
the devil after our souls,

19:17.891 --> 19:19.390
Well, we're all in trouble.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.592
But if they are men,
as I suspect they are,

19:21.594 --> 19:23.494
They can be found and caught.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.899
Conde:
<i>I assume your concern</i>
<i>is for his new bride, estelle.</i>

19:27.901 --> 19:30.701
I've heard many terrible
things about narcisse.

19:30.703 --> 19:34.338
But I don't know these tales
of him brutalizing his wives.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.340
Well, how many wives
has the man had?

19:36.342 --> 19:39.410
I believe estelle
is his fourth.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.745
It would appear
he burned through

19:40.747 --> 19:42.280
The first three
rather quickly.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.515
Well, how are we supposed
to protect estelle?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.851
Narcisse will not want to part
with his new plaything...

19:46.853 --> 19:49.453
Not without
a viable alternative.

19:49.455 --> 19:52.790
This ball is as enjoyable
as a clergyman's eulogy.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.525
Why aren't the young
people dancing?

19:54.527 --> 19:57.528
Not you, of course,
in your condition.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.530
Louis, save us

19:59.532 --> 20:01.699
From this dirge.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.868
And why don't you take
poor greer with you?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.470
I feel more kindly
towards her, as we get closer

20:06.472 --> 20:09.407
To her marriage to
that spectacularly
rich castleroy.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.810
Now, go.

20:12.812 --> 20:16.714
Oh, look at her, flanked by
the dullest cows in France.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.985
â™ª

20:35.867 --> 20:38.002
(gasps)

20:38.004 --> 20:40.905
Leith. Here you
are again.

20:42.007 --> 20:44.008
I realize our paths will cross,

20:44.010 --> 20:45.743
But there's no reason
for things to be awkward.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.314
Of course.

20:50.316 --> 20:52.984
â™ª

21:16.308 --> 21:17.041
I have to go.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.882
Lord narcisse, was your
wife unable to join us?

21:24.884 --> 21:27.351
She's in her chamber,
getting ready.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.453
Ah.
It's as if women were designed

21:29.455 --> 21:31.422
To aggravate
their lords and masters.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.991
The king and I were just
discussing your recent marriage.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.893
He was surprised
to meet estelle.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.295
As was I.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.430
Why is that?
We thought

21:39.432 --> 21:41.499
A man of your stature
would require a bride

21:41.501 --> 21:43.701
With a far more
substantial dowry.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.571
The plague claimed the
lives of many noblemen,

21:47.573 --> 21:50.608
Leaving a whole
string of lonely,

21:50.610 --> 21:52.610
Landed widows
in its wake.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.046
They come to court,
seeking a new lord.

21:55.048 --> 21:57.448
Some with dowries
to rival my own.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.483
Forgive my rudeness,

21:59.485 --> 22:01.319
My queen, but...

22:01.321 --> 22:03.054
But what is the point

22:03.056 --> 22:05.523
To this line of inquiry?

22:05.525 --> 22:07.658
As you keep reminding
my husband and I,

22:07.660 --> 22:09.727
France owes you
a significant debt.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.996
One that could
perhaps be eased

22:11.998 --> 22:13.397
By our arranging

22:13.399 --> 22:14.865
An advantageous marriage
for you?

22:14.867 --> 22:17.101
Narcisse:
An interesting proposal.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.869
But I am already wed.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.104
Francis and I would be
willing to support

22:20.106 --> 22:21.439
The annulment of your marriage.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.741
My lord,
lady estelle is missing

22:23.743 --> 22:25.676
From her chamber and the guard
at the door's been stabbed.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.877
Gather our men.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.679
Post guards
on the castle gate.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.414
Yes, my lord.
I want her found!

22:30.416 --> 22:32.116
Her defiance

22:32.118 --> 22:34.719
Will be the end of her.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.687
Lola:
Estelle!

22:36.689 --> 22:39.490
I tried to get away, but one
of narcisse's guards caught me.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.559
I grabbed his dagger.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.427
I think I killed him!

22:43.429 --> 22:44.695
And they're looking for me.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.364
I'll never get away now.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.898
And I can't go back.

22:55.841 --> 22:57.842
Hurry! We don't have much time.
Guard:
Check every room!

23:00.579 --> 23:02.113
How could you do this?

23:02.115 --> 23:04.615
When I expressly
warned you not to?

23:04.617 --> 23:06.083
Do you have any idea
what kind of danger

23:06.085 --> 23:07.985
You put yourself in?
I had plans to have estelle

23:07.987 --> 23:09.687
Taken out of the castle
to some friends in the country.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.021
She would've disappeared
and no one the wiser.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.724
Well, that's not going
to work now, is it?

23:13.726 --> 23:16.527
Now that narcisse's guards are
crawling all over the castle.

23:16.529 --> 23:17.962
You must abandon
this course

23:17.964 --> 23:19.730
And give her up
for both of your sakes.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.766
No.
If narcisse learns

23:21.768 --> 23:24.034
That you had a hand
in helping his wife run away,

23:24.036 --> 23:25.736
Your life will be in danger.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.939
He has no qualms about murdering
innocents for vengeance.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.708
And you are no innocent.

23:30.710 --> 23:31.842
Narcisse's cruelty

23:31.844 --> 23:32.977
Is precisely the reason I can't

23:32.979 --> 23:34.612
Hand estelle back to him.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.614
Despite what the law says,
estelle is a person.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.983
Not a thing
to be taken or given.

23:38.985 --> 23:41.552
And besides, it's too late.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.421
She killed one of his guards,
and it is his right

23:43.423 --> 23:44.922
To have her hanged for it.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.057
You've done your
duty by warning me.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.492
If we're discovered,

23:48.494 --> 23:49.593
So be it.

23:49.595 --> 23:52.463
But I will not abandon her.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.064
(men shouting in distance)

23:57.102 --> 23:59.036
Then neither will I.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.604
Come with me.

24:08.547 --> 24:09.880
Safe journey.
And good luck.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.515
I owe you my life.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.918
(men shouting in distance)

24:13.920 --> 24:16.020
Stop! Open up. Everyone out.

24:16.022 --> 24:18.088
Is there a problem, soldier?
Your majesty.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.791
Forgive us. We're under orders
by lord narcisse

24:20.793 --> 24:22.526
To search all carriages
leaving the castle.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.929
The only people in this carriage
are my servants,

24:24.931 --> 24:26.564
Transporting the heart
of our late king

24:26.566 --> 24:28.199
To the basilica at saint-denis.

24:28.201 --> 24:30.901
If king francis learns

24:30.903 --> 24:33.637
That the sacred relic
of his most beloved father

24:33.639 --> 24:36.106
Was manhandled
by common guards,

24:36.108 --> 24:38.576
I promise he will
have you put

24:38.578 --> 24:41.212
In the stocks and whipped
until you are dead.

24:41.214 --> 24:43.047
So I repeat.

24:43.049 --> 24:46.016
Is there a problem, soldier?

24:47.686 --> 24:50.554
No, your majesty.

24:50.556 --> 24:51.755
Forgive us.

24:56.528 --> 24:57.561
(sighs)

24:57.563 --> 24:59.630
Driver?

25:06.638 --> 25:09.206
Narcisse hasn't sent any guards
after the carriage.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.709
I think estelle is safe.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.511
I think after your speech
to those guards,

25:13.513 --> 25:15.779
They won't be saying
anything to anyone.

25:16.915 --> 25:19.617
Oof.

25:19.619 --> 25:22.286
What made you decide
to help estelle?

25:22.288 --> 25:24.221
If narcisse finds out,
it'll make things

25:24.223 --> 25:25.723
Harder for you
and francis.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.759
You were in danger.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.962
And you are my friend.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.665
Am I a friend you can forgive?

25:39.004 --> 25:41.205
I know you never
meant to hurt me.

25:41.207 --> 25:44.074
But I did hurt you.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.877
And you have only been
kind and gracious,

25:46.879 --> 25:48.279
Which makes it even worse.

25:48.281 --> 25:50.948
Can you please stop
feeling guilty?

25:52.651 --> 25:55.019
And stay with the
people who love you.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.122
Stay as my friend.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.057
As one of my ladies
so that our children

26:00.059 --> 26:02.226
Can grow up to be
as close as we are.

26:02.228 --> 26:05.162
Nothing would make me happier.

26:06.131 --> 26:07.998
Well, there is one thing.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.733
There's been no decision

26:09.735 --> 26:12.703
On a choice for godmother.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.305
I'm hoping it would be you.

26:14.307 --> 26:16.907
I know it puts you
in an awkward position.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.309
But there's no one

26:18.311 --> 26:21.245
I'd trust more
with my child than you.

26:23.048 --> 26:25.783
I would be honored.

26:30.055 --> 26:33.190
(bell tolling)

26:33.192 --> 26:35.159
You? The godmother?
Are you sure?

26:35.161 --> 26:36.860
Yes. Do you disapprove?

26:36.862 --> 26:38.929
No. Quite the opposite.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.631
It makes me happier
than any man,

26:40.633 --> 26:42.700
Any king has right to be.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.037
(sucks in air)

26:47.039 --> 26:48.305
Are you all right?

26:48.307 --> 26:50.808
Yes. I-I-I just
remembered I left

26:50.810 --> 26:52.910
The gift for the baby
in my chambers.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.946
You go ahead. I'll
be right behind you.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.617
(inhales sharply)

27:01.086 --> 27:03.387
Mary.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.389
What's wrong?

27:05.391 --> 27:06.957
Um, it's nothing.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.359
Well, it's not nothing.
I'll get help.

27:08.361 --> 27:09.827
No!

27:09.829 --> 27:11.762
Oh, could you just
help me to my rooms.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.635
You need a physician.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.703
No. Tell no one.

27:24.376 --> 27:27.177
You're bleeding.

27:27.179 --> 27:31.015
I'm losing my child.

27:31.017 --> 27:34.785
There's nothing
we can do about it now.

27:34.787 --> 27:37.921
No! No one must know
until after the christening.

27:37.923 --> 27:40.991
I have to tell
francis myself and...

27:40.993 --> 27:43.127
I don't want to ruin things
for lola and the baby.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.995
Now is not the time
to think of others.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.664
If you consider
yourself a friend,

27:46.666 --> 27:47.865
You will not say a word.

27:47.867 --> 27:50.734
To anyone.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.248
<i>Hoc cum dixisset insuflavit</i>

28:04.250 --> 28:06.717
<i>Et dicit eis accipter</i>

28:06.719 --> 28:09.286
<i>Spiritui sanctim.</i>

28:10.422 --> 28:12.189
Where's greer?

28:12.191 --> 28:14.458
I don't see leith either.

28:14.460 --> 28:17.027
â™ª what are you afraid of?

28:17.029 --> 28:18.829
â™ª I know that you are

28:18.831 --> 28:22.766
â™ª keep it in your sights now

28:22.768 --> 28:24.435
â™ª and don't let it go far

28:24.437 --> 28:27.471
In nomine filii

28:27.473 --> 28:31.075
Hoc in conspectus
multitudinis unxi te...

28:31.077 --> 28:34.845
â™ª keep it by your side now

28:34.847 --> 28:36.447
â™ª whatever the weather

28:36.449 --> 28:39.349
...John phillip
valois-angouleme,

28:39.351 --> 28:41.819
First baron of velay.

28:42.987 --> 28:45.956
â™ª keep

28:45.958 --> 28:49.927
â™ª it together

28:49.929 --> 28:56.300
â™ª keep...

28:56.302 --> 29:01.138
â™ª on...

29:01.140 --> 29:06.810
â™ª keep...

29:06.812 --> 29:11.949
â™ª on...

29:11.951 --> 29:13.784
Excuse me, my lord.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.053
Lady greer is here
to see you.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.488
Greer?

29:17.490 --> 29:20.224
I wasn't expecting you.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.092
I co... I couldn't
wait any longer.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.093
I rode here

29:23.095 --> 29:24.795
All night...

29:24.797 --> 29:26.230
Because I want to marry you.

29:26.232 --> 29:29.199
I know you don't truly love me.

29:29.201 --> 29:32.102
I do. My feelings have grown.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.537
Not the way you love leith.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.239
You want this marriage
for what I can offer you--

29:35.241 --> 29:37.241
Stability and security.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.942
I loved you.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.144
And I wanted to protect you.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.378
From ruin.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.880
From your mistakes.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.115
But my hope
that I can be happy again

29:45.117 --> 29:48.218
With yvette gone...

29:48.220 --> 29:51.822
I will no longer put
my happiness at risk

29:51.824 --> 29:53.824
To save you from yourself.

29:53.826 --> 29:56.426
I was planning
to write this to you.

29:56.428 --> 29:59.263
You're welcome to rest here
for a few hours,

29:59.265 --> 30:02.065
But then you should return
to court.

30:07.839 --> 30:09.840
Lady lola!

30:09.842 --> 30:11.108
What is it?
Were you found?

30:11.110 --> 30:12.543
No, my lady.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.144
We delivered lady
estelle to the house.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.979
But then

30:15.981 --> 30:17.915
She disappeared.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.550
We found her at the
edge of a cliff.

30:19.552 --> 30:21.585
And before we
could stop her,

30:21.587 --> 30:24.855
She threw herself down
into the rocks below.

30:24.857 --> 30:27.024
She didn't survive.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.525
Could she have been pushed?

30:28.527 --> 30:30.027
Was there anyone with her?

30:30.029 --> 30:31.428
No.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.430
But she saw someone below.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.332
Her parents, she said.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.301
Oh, that's impossible.
They died in the plague.

30:37.303 --> 30:38.535
She said

30:38.537 --> 30:41.371
She heard them
calling to her.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.442
Conde:
Your grace?

30:45.444 --> 30:46.877
Your majesty.
Your majesty.

30:46.879 --> 30:49.079
Have you seen the queen?

30:49.081 --> 30:50.881
After the ceremony, she...

30:50.883 --> 30:53.183
Didn't look herself.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.551
I didn't realize.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.053
Thank you, louis.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.888
Something's happened
with the shepherd.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.323
We need to go back.

30:59.325 --> 31:00.858
Go.

31:10.168 --> 31:12.402
I don't understand
how she got away.

31:12.404 --> 31:13.937
Out of the castle,

31:13.939 --> 31:16.440
A cliff in the country.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.942
Estelle seemed troubled.

31:18.944 --> 31:20.510
Afraid.

31:20.512 --> 31:22.546
Perhaps she was
fleeing something.

31:22.548 --> 31:23.947
You heard the rumors.

31:23.949 --> 31:25.549
Those damning rumors
of my treatments

31:25.551 --> 31:27.050
Of my past wives.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.352
Do you deny them?

31:28.354 --> 31:29.553
Contrary
to the reputation

31:29.555 --> 31:33.457
I enjoy, I am not a
soulless animal.

31:33.459 --> 31:36.393
There didn't seem
to be an excess

31:36.395 --> 31:39.363
Of tenderness between you.

31:39.365 --> 31:40.564
Did estelle tell you
that her father owed me

31:40.566 --> 31:42.165
A substantial debt?

31:42.167 --> 31:46.036
I wed her so she may
keep her property.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.437
And for yourself?

31:47.439 --> 31:50.440
She was young, and I need heirs.

31:50.442 --> 31:54.077
We both lost family
to the plague.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.680
But the difference is that
she thought hers had returned,

31:56.682 --> 31:59.983
That they were
beckoning her.

31:59.985 --> 32:02.286
She tried to take
her life before.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.388
So, I kept her
under close guard,

32:04.390 --> 32:06.523
Thinking that
I could protect her.

32:06.525 --> 32:09.059
And the rumors
of your other wives?

32:09.061 --> 32:10.627
You can't stop them.

32:10.629 --> 32:14.264
I was young
when I first married,

32:14.266 --> 32:16.533
A wealthy match
my father made.

32:16.535 --> 32:20.337
He pushed us both, relentlessly,
to produce an heir.

32:22.206 --> 32:24.541
There were miscarriages.

32:24.543 --> 32:28.545
And yet we kept on trying.

32:28.547 --> 32:33.417
I was 15, I knew nothing
of women or their bodies.

32:35.119 --> 32:39.556
A year after she died,
my father arranged my second.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.158
A hemophiliac.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.659
The pools of blood.

32:42.661 --> 32:46.096
She faded away
before my eyes.

32:49.033 --> 32:51.668
I rarely speak of these things.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.037
You've never been in love.

32:54.039 --> 32:57.975
That is a rare jewel
I've yet to see.

33:00.445 --> 33:03.080
(horse neighing)

33:23.201 --> 33:25.502
God help us.

33:25.504 --> 33:29.606
Shepherd: I remember being cross
with my wife, her voice shrill,

33:29.608 --> 33:33.377
The children were crying,
they wouldn't sleep.

33:33.379 --> 33:36.213
I was so tired.

33:36.215 --> 33:39.082
I haven't been right
since the night of the storm.

33:39.084 --> 33:43.387
The next thing I knew I...
I had shears in my hand.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.789
I did this.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.791
I murdered them.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.092
Why?

33:49.094 --> 33:50.227
I said no.

33:50.229 --> 33:52.229
I said no.

33:52.231 --> 33:55.032
Strip him.

33:58.503 --> 34:00.504
The mark of the riders.

34:00.506 --> 34:01.705
I said no.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.107
I would not
renounce my faith,

34:04.109 --> 34:06.276
But they held me down, they...

34:06.278 --> 34:07.811
They took it from me,

34:07.813 --> 34:09.613
They took my soul,

34:09.615 --> 34:11.281
And they let the devil in.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.497
Mary, what is it?

34:27.499 --> 34:29.566
I lost the baby.

34:33.304 --> 34:36.406
Why didn't you
send for me?

34:36.408 --> 34:39.176
You seemed so happy.

34:42.146 --> 34:45.849
And I know how much
it meant to you.

34:45.851 --> 34:50.320
Not for the realm, for you.

34:50.322 --> 34:53.723
You want us to be a family.

34:53.725 --> 34:58.628
These last weeks,
I couldn't help wondering--

34:58.630 --> 35:01.631
Would he have your curls,

35:01.633 --> 35:03.867
Or have your eyes,

35:03.869 --> 35:05.335
Or would he be a blend
of us both?

35:05.337 --> 35:07.737
(quietly):
It's all right.

35:10.174 --> 35:12.776
(crying)

35:31.896 --> 35:34.664
(crickets chirping)

35:34.666 --> 35:37.267
Greer, I don't want
to be cruel.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.136
You're right,
leith and I had a connection.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.403
I don't want
to hear about leith.

35:40.405 --> 35:42.272
You need to know
why I'm not with him,

35:42.274 --> 35:43.406
And why
I never will be.

35:43.408 --> 35:46.643
A friend told me I needed

35:46.645 --> 35:49.713
To be honest with myself
about who I am.

35:49.715 --> 35:52.149
I'm not a good partner
for leith.

35:52.151 --> 35:56.653
The path he's on,
his desire to rise.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.922
I-I can't go on that journey.

35:58.924 --> 36:01.525
Not only because
of my family's needs,

36:01.527 --> 36:04.761
But because of the uncertainty,

36:04.763 --> 36:07.397
The possibility that
he's only doing it for me.

36:07.399 --> 36:08.732
With you--

36:08.734 --> 36:10.233
I know I'll be happy.

36:10.235 --> 36:11.601
Because I'm rich.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.870
Because I know who you are,

36:13.872 --> 36:16.206
Rather than wondering
who you will become.

36:18.276 --> 36:23.947
You are gracious
and brave and kind.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.782
You helped my sisters,

36:25.784 --> 36:28.251
Stood up to my father.

36:28.253 --> 36:29.686
You value me.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.722
Not as a prize,
but as a partner.

36:32.724 --> 36:38.562
And I worry that if you
let me go, you will regret it.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.630
Because I know
I can make you happy, too.

36:40.632 --> 36:43.767
I want a union
based in something

36:43.769 --> 36:47.437
More than compassion and sorrow.

36:47.439 --> 36:48.939
You want passion.

36:48.941 --> 36:50.807
I admit it-- I want it, too.

36:50.809 --> 36:53.877
I can't, I won't
live without it.

36:53.879 --> 36:58.815
But we haven't given this
a true chance.

36:58.817 --> 37:01.551
I haven't.

37:10.294 --> 37:13.363
Let's see what's
really between us.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.005
You don't have to do this.

37:22.007 --> 37:25.275
I want to.

37:45.363 --> 37:48.732
Bash: The shepherd is in the
dungeon, awaiting your judgment.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.367
Conde: The man
is barking mad.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.502
The riders didn't
collect his soul.

37:52.504 --> 37:55.572
You still think these riders
are just men.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.040
I don't know anymore.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.642
Conde:
It's all nonsense.

37:58.644 --> 38:01.911
The things I saw
at that house seemed inhuman.

38:01.913 --> 38:06.850
We were warned, after the
plague, of angry spirits,

38:06.852 --> 38:08.985
Staying behind to exact justice.

38:11.789 --> 38:16.660
The wrongs we do, I believe
they mark us, they change us.

38:16.662 --> 38:21.698
Sometimes they linger,
maybe even take form.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.668
Our father went mad.

38:24.670 --> 38:27.003
No doubt as a result
of the multitude of his sins,

38:27.005 --> 38:29.973
And he was killed
at another's hand.

38:29.975 --> 38:33.410
There is always a reckoning.

38:33.412 --> 38:36.546
And human or devil,
I think the riders play a part.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.682
Dark times are upon us--

38:38.684 --> 38:42.352
Plague, famine, kings falling.

38:43.688 --> 38:45.622
The reckoning has begun.

38:47.958 --> 38:50.694
And blood will pay for blood.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.040
Help us.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.709
Who are you?

39:05.711 --> 39:07.377
You didn't before.

39:07.379 --> 39:08.578
Help us now.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.981
The sage.

39:28.032 --> 39:31.634
I'm glad you're
feeling better.

39:31.636 --> 39:33.703
The pain is passed.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.004
And the air is lovely.

39:35.006 --> 39:39.142
But what did you want
me to see?

39:39.144 --> 39:41.911
I was thinking about your
memories of us here,

39:41.913 --> 39:47.016
As children, and
I have my own.

39:47.018 --> 39:50.587
It was mid-June,
you were eight.

39:50.589 --> 39:54.057
We stood outside like this,
but on the south lawn.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.059
We'd escaped the castle
at night,

39:56.061 --> 39:57.727
It had to be dark.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.563
We wanted to see the fireflies.

40:00.565 --> 40:03.099
Every year we'd
try to catch them.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.068
You always worried
they wouldn't come.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.804
And it's true,
some nights they would,

40:07.806 --> 40:09.806
Some nights they wouldn't.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.975
And when they didn't,
I would cry.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.476
I never worried.

40:13.478 --> 40:15.879
The thrill for me
was in the waiting.

40:17.114 --> 40:18.948
With you.

40:26.557 --> 40:28.191
Look over the balcony.

40:30.995 --> 40:33.062
Francis.

40:36.734 --> 40:38.735
Mary:
You did this for me?

40:38.737 --> 40:40.103
Fireflies.

40:46.143 --> 40:49.145
The world can be
dark, mary,

40:49.147 --> 40:52.982
And uncertain,

40:52.984 --> 40:56.820
And cruel.

40:56.822 --> 40:58.521
The only thing that
really matters is

40:58.523 --> 40:59.956
That we face it together.

41:05.696 --> 41:09.766
Whatever the future brings,
you are my light.
