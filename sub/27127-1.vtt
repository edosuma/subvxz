00:35.649 --> 00:37.549
It looks like murder.

00:37.551 --> 00:38.585
No.

00:39.786 --> 00:42.686
Our faith does not
make us incapable.

00:42.688 --> 00:43.788
Suicide.

00:43.790 --> 00:45.556
Suicide is unforgivable.

00:45.558 --> 00:47.159
We know the answer.

00:47.861 --> 00:49.561
It was her.

00:49.563 --> 00:51.229
She's in a cage, Abbot.

00:51.231 --> 00:52.265
She got out.

00:53.433 --> 00:54.632
It will not happen again.

00:54.634 --> 00:56.200
We will bind her in the cage

00:56.202 --> 00:57.434
with the reliquaries.

00:57.436 --> 00:58.937
We should sermon
the Inquisition.

00:58.939 --> 01:00.439
Enough.

01:03.910 --> 01:06.646
Pestilence, field crops,

01:07.680 --> 01:11.281
the town expects us
to pass judgment.

01:11.283 --> 01:13.617
They demand her death.

01:13.619 --> 01:15.620
We cannot do this
without the proper authority.

01:15.622 --> 01:16.988
We will do what God demands.

01:16.990 --> 01:18.658
This is not God's work.

01:25.598 --> 01:28.567
She will be weakest
at dark moon.

01:31.570 --> 01:32.970
Pray for strength.

03:37.027 --> 03:38.996
Sorry, did I wake you?

03:40.697 --> 03:42.365
No apologies needed.

03:47.771 --> 03:48.806
The dream.

03:49.873 --> 03:52.007
Did you go inside the room?

03:52.009 --> 03:53.575
I never do.

03:53.577 --> 03:56.579
Well, dreams
are harmless enough.

03:59.116 --> 04:01.752
Wise words
from the great Johnny.

04:04.420 --> 04:06.120
A good breakfast
will ease your mind.

04:06.122 --> 04:09.157
No, thank you.

04:09.159 --> 04:10.793
I'm not hungry.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.410
I write to you
in haste and in secret.

04:29.412 --> 04:31.413
A Brother of the
Hedgerow Abbey has died.

04:32.414 --> 04:35.950
I request an Inquisitor
of the True Dawn immediately.

04:35.952 --> 04:38.721
May God bless their journey
with speed and safety.

04:39.655 --> 04:43.525
Our great Abbot is convinced the
death is a result of witchcraft.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.093
He plans to execute
the accused woman

04:46.095 --> 04:48.528
without the Inquisition's
approval.

04:48.530 --> 04:51.031
I only wish God's will
to be done.

04:51.033 --> 04:53.703
Best regards, Brother Felix.

04:55.804 --> 04:58.975
May you bring us good fortune
and keep us in good health.

05:00.575 --> 05:03.045
May you shine your grace
on those who serve

05:05.047 --> 05:06.915
and those who do not.

05:09.084 --> 05:11.517
Continue to believe in them

05:11.519 --> 05:14.656
even though
they do not believe, Father.

06:18.752 --> 06:20.654
Hedgerow Abbey.

06:21.855 --> 06:24.591
My stomach is in knots,
now I see it again.

06:26.694 --> 06:28.229
God will give you strength.

06:29.762 --> 06:31.165
You only have to ask.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.002
Strength comes from resolve,

06:36.804 --> 06:37.771
not God.

07:03.263 --> 07:05.265
Even here the plague
is taking hold.

07:08.167 --> 07:09.900
Shite inquisitor.

07:09.902 --> 07:11.569
She must burn.

07:11.571 --> 07:13.107
Burn her or we will.

08:17.070 --> 08:19.938
My God, we're too late.

08:22.374 --> 08:26.845
No, she was branded a heretic.

08:28.114 --> 08:30.681
They're acting without
the proper authority.

08:55.673 --> 08:56.874
Hello!

08:58.276 --> 09:00.112
Is anyone here?

09:19.163 --> 09:21.063
Hello!

09:21.065 --> 09:22.831
I am Mateho of the...

09:30.174 --> 09:32.810
I am Mateho of the True Dawn.

09:38.249 --> 09:40.985
I must insist
that you let us in at once.

09:48.993 --> 09:51.727
- Watch your step.
- I received a letter from Brother Felix

09:51.729 --> 09:54.762
- claiming that...
- We are humble monks here

09:54.764 --> 09:56.400
devoting all our time to God.

09:57.834 --> 09:59.136
We live a quiet life.

10:03.841 --> 10:05.374
Burning heretics
without a proper trial

10:05.376 --> 10:06.774
is punishable by law.

10:06.776 --> 10:08.876
You're young for an inquisitor.

10:08.878 --> 10:10.345
An apprentice?

10:10.347 --> 10:12.747
I'm qualified, I assure you.

10:12.749 --> 10:16.753
I had hoped the True Dawn would
have sent an experienced agent.

10:20.123 --> 10:22.358
Do not let
my appearance fool you.

10:26.262 --> 10:28.363
Nor mine.

10:28.365 --> 10:30.264
The Abbot must be made
aware of your presence.

10:30.266 --> 10:33.935
No, I wish to speak
to the girl first.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.269
Procedure dictates our first...

10:35.271 --> 10:37.006
Take me to the girl.

11:13.041 --> 11:14.277
An inquisitor?

11:47.309 --> 11:49.244
I'll begin
questioning the others.

11:50.879 --> 11:52.347
We'll reconvene later.

12:01.022 --> 12:02.090
Is something wrong?

12:03.358 --> 12:05.426
He is not fond of small spaces.

12:09.230 --> 12:10.231
Stay close.

12:11.332 --> 12:14.569
The labyrinth of tunnels
down here can be confusing.

12:16.104 --> 12:21.008
Yes, I remember.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.251
Here we are.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.395
This is the condition
you keep her in?

13:15.463 --> 13:17.564
I am only a scribe, Inquisitor.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.533
This is beyond my authority.

13:22.670 --> 13:24.469
I see.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.293
I'm here to help you.

14:24.496 --> 14:26.062
Has she confessed?

14:26.064 --> 14:26.999
Not yet.

14:31.336 --> 14:32.471
But she will.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.574
You must be the Abbot.

14:37.576 --> 14:40.245
I find myself confused.

14:41.446 --> 14:46.618
Why is there
an inquisitor in my dungeon?

14:49.721 --> 14:50.989
I summoned him

14:53.424 --> 14:56.327
to help solve the mystery
surrounding Francisco's death.

14:57.261 --> 15:00.164
I wanted to come to you, but he
insisted on coming here first.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.303
Forgive me, Abbot.

15:07.705 --> 15:10.609
This girl is barely of age.

15:12.678 --> 15:16.179
Black magic
is not limited by age.

15:16.181 --> 15:18.113
What would she know
of magic, Abbot?

15:18.115 --> 15:20.382
Skeptic.

15:22.119 --> 15:24.821
No, she has a pact
with the Devil.

15:24.823 --> 15:26.623
She will burn.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.292
Not if she is innocent.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.195
You think these
will protect you?

15:32.230 --> 15:33.696
And the manacles?

15:33.698 --> 15:36.565
We've known peace
since she's been secured.

15:36.567 --> 15:39.036
You are allowing paranoia
to corrupt your mind.

15:40.806 --> 15:43.340
Remove the manacles.
We are not barbarians.

15:44.241 --> 15:48.145
And these,
these are not necessary.

15:49.313 --> 15:53.114
Careful, boy. Ignorance will not
protect you from the Devil.

15:53.116 --> 15:55.151
Ignorance has nothing
to do with it.

15:56.554 --> 15:58.219
We'll give her a test.

15:58.221 --> 15:59.655
The church directs
that we use tests

15:59.657 --> 16:00.756
only as a last resort.

16:00.758 --> 16:03.394
Give her a test.

16:07.397 --> 16:08.665
You want a test?

16:11.268 --> 16:12.637
Very well.

16:17.173 --> 16:18.675
I need you to look at this.

16:25.883 --> 16:27.652
I need you to look at me.

16:28.719 --> 16:31.788
Your tests often harm
and kill the innocent victims.

16:34.691 --> 16:36.226
The cross, please.

17:04.521 --> 17:06.221
The cross, please.

17:10.358 --> 17:13.359
The Devil cannot
look upon the Holy Cross.

17:13.362 --> 17:15.632
She has been tortured
in the name of God.

17:17.465 --> 17:18.733
I would not look at it, either.

17:19.801 --> 17:21.804
Are you a witch, Inquisitor?

17:25.207 --> 17:27.409
She will not
be tortured further.

17:28.645 --> 17:30.613
Is that understood, Abbot?

17:32.915 --> 17:35.215
What do you intend
to accomplish here?

17:35.217 --> 17:37.718
I intend to save
an innocent life.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.487
Did you realize what would
happen if she was set free?

17:40.489 --> 17:42.756
Yes, a girl would go home.

17:42.758 --> 17:45.692
No, no, no. She has no home.

17:45.694 --> 17:47.794
No. Family run out of town.

17:47.796 --> 17:49.830
If the town people see her free

17:49.832 --> 17:53.466
they will seek justice
on their own terms.

17:53.468 --> 17:55.534
We are doing God's work.

17:55.536 --> 17:58.306
God will not torture and murder
innocent victims,

17:59.240 --> 18:00.542
nor will the church.

18:01.944 --> 18:07.647
You, you do not belong here.

18:07.649 --> 18:08.884
I beg you.

18:09.852 --> 18:12.588
I beg you, leave at once.

18:17.659 --> 18:20.495
I am not going anywhere.

18:41.481 --> 18:43.483
Take me to the scene
of the transgression.

18:47.288 --> 18:50.425
He laid here in a pool
of his own blood.

18:57.397 --> 19:00.333
This dagger was found
in his hand.

19:05.639 --> 19:09.743
Was it in his hand
like this or like this?

19:11.646 --> 19:13.612
Like that?

19:21.788 --> 19:23.657
Were there
any signs of struggle?

19:24.558 --> 19:26.792
The candles knocked over?

19:26.794 --> 19:28.460
Things broken?

19:28.462 --> 19:30.595
Footprints in the blood?

19:30.597 --> 19:31.732
Nothing.

19:35.936 --> 19:37.270
And the body?

19:38.906 --> 19:39.974
This way.

20:17.076 --> 20:18.511
I will do this alone.

20:23.582 --> 20:24.818
Thank you.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.404
Felix?

22:29.973 --> 22:30.972
Felix!

22:35.078 --> 22:37.113
Did you ask for me specifically?

22:37.115 --> 22:38.082
No.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.520
What is it?

22:46.990 --> 22:49.793
I cannot discuss the details
of my investigation with you.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.196
I am the one who summoned you.

22:54.231 --> 22:57.698
That does not exonerates
you or give you privilege.

22:57.700 --> 23:00.671
You are all suspects until I
discover the truth behind this.

23:21.891 --> 23:23.524
Why do they chant?

23:23.526 --> 23:25.628
They pray for our lost Brother.

23:36.239 --> 23:39.608
Tomorrow, we will retrace
the steps of Francisco's life.

23:40.543 --> 23:43.277
If there are any clues
to his death, we will find them.

23:43.279 --> 23:45.045
Of course.

23:45.047 --> 23:47.147
If there's any way I can assist?

23:47.149 --> 23:50.152
What were his daily
activities, his interests?

23:51.254 --> 23:53.021
Brother Francisco was...

23:54.190 --> 23:55.657
Was what?

23:57.193 --> 23:58.660
Part of the inner circle.

24:00.129 --> 24:02.531
It's rare to see
Brothers of such status.

24:03.566 --> 24:08.135
They will spend hours
in the sanctum.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.075
We will need access
to the sanctum.

24:15.811 --> 24:17.078
That is a sacred room.

24:18.013 --> 24:19.914
Only members of
the inner circle allowed.

24:20.949 --> 24:22.882
This is your room.

24:32.794 --> 24:34.195
Thank you.

24:35.297 --> 24:38.298
Hey, get some sleep.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.534
You too.

24:44.739 --> 24:46.107
For the sake of the abbey,

24:47.642 --> 24:49.609
I hope you know
what you're doing.

24:49.611 --> 24:50.377
Thank you.

24:50.379 --> 24:52.279
I'll pray for you.

34:34.318 --> 34:35.686
You scared me.

34:42.827 --> 34:44.261
What is your name?

34:49.935 --> 34:52.135
There is no reason to fear me.

34:55.940 --> 34:57.775
I see they removed
your manacles.

35:05.816 --> 35:07.584
Do you know what this is?

35:25.536 --> 35:26.837
Have you seen it before?

35:30.473 --> 35:31.541
You have?

35:32.709 --> 35:33.743
Where?

35:35.478 --> 35:36.513
What is it?

35:37.882 --> 35:38.816
Tell me.

35:48.525 --> 35:52.327
I'm not the evil
that torments this place.

35:56.633 --> 35:57.734
What is?

36:07.777 --> 36:09.378
I need answers.

36:14.751 --> 36:16.318
Do you know who accused you?

36:21.891 --> 36:23.525
How did you get down here?

36:28.697 --> 36:30.897
Where is your family?

36:30.899 --> 36:32.000
Gone.

36:51.087 --> 36:52.320
Dead?

36:58.927 --> 37:00.596
Moved on?

37:02.065 --> 37:03.565
Moved on.

37:26.755 --> 37:27.955
Do you know the monks here?

37:49.377 --> 37:51.911
Did you know the monk who died?

37:51.913 --> 37:54.880
I know the inner circle.

37:54.882 --> 37:55.883
How?

38:21.008 --> 38:22.910
Do you know why
you have been accused?

38:30.851 --> 38:32.686
Have you made a pact
with the Devil?

38:49.971 --> 38:50.903
I...

39:07.888 --> 39:09.956
Help me.

39:45.524 --> 39:47.626
Help me.

40:10.649 --> 40:11.684
Johnny.

40:12.918 --> 40:14.851
Johnny.

40:14.853 --> 40:17.455
Mateho. You nearly run me over.

40:18.257 --> 40:19.555
Sorry.

40:19.557 --> 40:22.593
Johnny, I found the door.

40:23.829 --> 40:25.796
- From the dream?
- Yes.

40:25.798 --> 40:27.064
Where did it lead?

40:27.066 --> 40:28.566
It was locked.

40:31.303 --> 40:32.870
Come, let's get a meal.

40:54.325 --> 40:56.728
Inquisitor, come.

41:07.338 --> 41:09.205
Hungry?

41:09.207 --> 41:10.507
Starving.

41:17.647 --> 41:18.715
Eat.

41:23.021 --> 41:23.955
You'll need it.

41:55.919 --> 41:57.285
The food is rotten.

42:01.691 --> 42:04.227
She spoiled the food
before our eyes.

42:11.768 --> 42:14.736
She must be executed at once.

42:19.742 --> 42:22.277
Calm down, Brothers.

42:22.279 --> 42:24.412
Her powers are growing.

42:24.414 --> 42:26.147
We must unite against the witch.

42:26.149 --> 42:27.150
Inigo!

42:30.186 --> 42:32.686
You must allow the Inquisitor

42:32.688 --> 42:36.326
to proceed
with this investigation.

42:47.002 --> 42:49.004
Where is the grain
this is made from?

42:50.873 --> 42:52.174
The grain is over there.

42:58.047 --> 43:00.247
Food does not
just spoil suddenly.

43:00.249 --> 43:02.151
Moments ago it was not rotten.

43:14.063 --> 43:15.864
As I thought.

43:18.267 --> 43:22.402
I offer encounter similar
situations on every case.

43:22.404 --> 43:25.906
You're allowing fear
to feed your paranoia.

43:25.908 --> 43:27.675
You see what you want to see.

43:28.843 --> 43:33.014
Come and see the truth
for yourselves.

43:46.094 --> 43:47.929
The source is spoiled.

43:50.932 --> 43:55.103
This is very common when food
is not stored properly.

44:05.045 --> 44:07.814
Two bottles of...

44:26.034 --> 44:28.335
One bottle of anise.

44:33.941 --> 44:35.042
Is someone there?

44:51.358 --> 44:53.493
This is no place for a child.

45:11.245 --> 45:13.280
We need to know what takes place
in the sanctum.

45:17.049 --> 45:19.018
Of course.

45:22.489 --> 45:24.057
Good morning, Teton.

45:33.567 --> 45:35.167
I will start by asking him.

45:39.106 --> 45:40.273
Find you later.

45:52.618 --> 45:55.855
- For your family.
- God bless you.

45:56.856 --> 45:58.055
Go.

45:58.057 --> 45:59.356
Stay in line.

45:59.358 --> 46:01.093
We have enough for everyone.

46:02.928 --> 46:04.229
Stay in line.

46:08.867 --> 46:10.236
Did you see a little girl?

46:11.404 --> 46:12.438
No.

46:24.417 --> 46:26.018
Wait!

46:27.153 --> 46:29.118
Here are your rations.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.355
God bless.

46:31.624 --> 46:33.089
Have you seen Teton?

46:33.091 --> 46:34.993
Yes, he went that way.

46:47.573 --> 46:49.072
Stop.

46:53.010 --> 46:54.544
I'm not going to hurt you.

46:57.315 --> 47:00.149
Have you noticed
something strange recently?

47:00.151 --> 47:01.451
What do you mean?

47:01.453 --> 47:03.086
I've
been seeing things.

47:03.088 --> 47:05.222
- God bless.
- Things that are untrue.

47:06.424 --> 47:07.459
Teton?

47:08.660 --> 47:10.360
Have you had issues sleeping?

47:10.362 --> 47:12.395
No.

47:12.397 --> 47:16.066
But ever since
the Inquisitor arrived, yes.

47:22.240 --> 47:23.274
Teton?

48:05.682 --> 48:07.049
Stay back.

48:23.700 --> 48:24.668
Inquisitor?

48:27.303 --> 48:28.271
I slipped.

48:32.341 --> 48:33.477
Back.

48:39.649 --> 48:41.384
She still lives.

48:44.487 --> 48:47.156
How many must die
before you burn her?

48:50.761 --> 48:53.360
This is nothing more
than an accident.

48:53.362 --> 48:56.732
Accident? The Inquisitor
thinks it was an accident.

49:02.806 --> 49:05.238
I think it's time we take
this into our own hands.

49:05.240 --> 49:07.008
Yeah!

49:10.746 --> 49:11.745
We need to go inside.

49:11.747 --> 49:13.681
This will all be settled

49:13.683 --> 49:15.482
in good time.

49:15.484 --> 49:16.750
Enough time.

49:16.752 --> 49:18.552
Get them. Kill the inquisitor.

49:18.554 --> 49:20.389
Go, go!

49:22.425 --> 49:24.458
Stay where you are.

49:24.460 --> 49:26.195
We take the giant as one.

49:28.263 --> 49:29.364
Teton's body.

49:30.666 --> 49:31.734
- Peiter.
- No.

49:32.768 --> 49:33.669
Ready?

49:44.279 --> 49:45.347
Leave the body.

49:46.515 --> 49:48.314
Johnny!

49:51.319 --> 49:53.118
Johnny!

50:07.269 --> 50:08.703
The town is in revolt.

50:10.138 --> 50:12.340
The town is in revolt.

50:13.241 --> 50:15.641
We barely escaped
with our lives.

50:15.643 --> 50:17.342
Were they provoked?

50:17.344 --> 50:19.144
Provoked?

50:25.353 --> 50:26.621
What is it?

50:34.529 --> 50:38.698
It's Teton, he's dead.

50:38.700 --> 50:39.898
What?

50:39.900 --> 50:41.535
He fell from the tower.

50:44.772 --> 50:46.638
We all saw it.

50:46.640 --> 50:48.541
She's killing us all one by one.

50:48.543 --> 50:50.476
There is no proof of that.

50:50.478 --> 50:53.545
Francisco, now Teton.

50:53.547 --> 50:55.149
- Yes.
- Stop!

50:56.684 --> 51:00.554
Each suspicion will mount
into a greater threat.

51:01.455 --> 51:02.822
Do not give into paranoia.

51:02.824 --> 51:04.388
Paranoia did not kill

51:04.390 --> 51:06.592
another of my Brothers.

51:06.594 --> 51:10.495
Your words are
dangerous, Inquisitor.

51:10.497 --> 51:12.866
Choose your next very carefully.

51:18.572 --> 51:22.608
The rain has made
the tower wet and dangerous.

51:22.610 --> 51:26.311
While examining the top,
I found a loose board.

51:26.313 --> 51:28.746
Now, if you go up there you will
also find a piece of cloth,

51:28.748 --> 51:30.681
stuck to the nail
holding the board down.

51:30.683 --> 51:33.621
- What are you saying?
- I am saying that he slipped.

51:34.655 --> 51:38.890
And his robes got tangled
and he unfortunately fell.

51:38.892 --> 51:40.526
Why was he up there?

51:45.231 --> 51:49.568
Brother Francisco was found with
a dagger in his hand like this.

51:49.570 --> 51:52.803
Self-inflicted wounds
are achieved this way.

51:52.805 --> 51:54.972
He had multiple stab wounds.

51:54.974 --> 51:56.841
The human body is resilient.

51:56.843 --> 51:58.476
Why would he do that?

51:58.478 --> 52:00.446
He was unhappy
with the inner circle.

52:04.282 --> 52:05.683
Continue.

52:05.685 --> 52:08.186
There will be
no further discussion.

52:09.222 --> 52:11.791
Francisco was killed
by the witch.

52:13.259 --> 52:15.258
Brother Francisco

52:15.260 --> 52:16.927
is responsible
for his own death.

52:16.929 --> 52:19.297
I will not wait any longer.

52:20.232 --> 52:21.734
She dies at dawn.

52:29.909 --> 52:31.778
We need to do the test.

52:33.012 --> 52:34.477
Are you certain?

52:34.479 --> 52:37.014
This superstition ends now.

52:37.016 --> 52:39.849
You saw the hate
in the townspeople's eyes.

52:39.851 --> 52:41.618
If the monks do not
kill her by morning,

52:41.620 --> 52:43.653
they will burn
this entire abbey to the ground,

52:43.655 --> 52:45.557
and all of us inside it.

52:48.293 --> 52:49.727
What if they're right?

52:49.729 --> 52:53.463
Johnny, I need you
with me on this.

52:53.465 --> 53:00.270
I am, and God is, but this,
this is a godless test.

53:00.272 --> 53:03.541
No, this is an infallible test.

53:04.843 --> 53:08.378
Promise me you'll get
some sleep tonight.

53:08.380 --> 53:10.647
A mind without rest
is an open door

53:10.649 --> 53:12.484
for the Devil's persuasions.

54:25.556 --> 54:26.690
Inquisitor?

54:29.692 --> 54:30.625
Inquisitor?

54:37.568 --> 54:40.134
- Peiter?
- I must come in.

54:40.136 --> 54:41.836
What are you doing here
at this hour?

54:41.838 --> 54:44.008
You and your friend
must leave tonight.

54:45.142 --> 54:48.045
Tomorrow, I will demonstrate
what is really going on here.

54:49.445 --> 54:51.779
Please do not let this
talk of witches shake you.

54:51.781 --> 54:54.048
I overheard the Abbot and Prior.

54:54.050 --> 54:56.150
They intend to cause you harm.

54:56.152 --> 54:58.354
I see.

54:59.056 --> 55:00.688
Once I have settled this mob,

55:00.690 --> 55:03.724
I'll be able to get a letter out
to the True Dawn.

55:03.726 --> 55:06.794
You do not understand.

55:06.796 --> 55:11.000
The Abbot is a very dangerous
and very powerful man.

55:14.404 --> 55:15.604
I know.

55:17.173 --> 55:19.408
Thank you for the warning.

56:09.992 --> 56:11.126
Begin.

57:08.749 --> 57:10.885
You understand
what you have to do?

57:15.289 --> 57:16.756
Get on with it.

57:22.196 --> 57:23.864
Please not again.

57:40.747 --> 57:43.948
This girl must lift
her eyes to the cross

57:43.950 --> 57:46.053
and breathe from
either of these holes.

57:48.755 --> 57:50.289
In doing so,

57:50.291 --> 57:52.258
she will be accepting
God's grace

57:53.660 --> 57:55.093
and be proven innocent.

57:55.095 --> 57:56.062
Huh.

58:10.310 --> 58:12.143
Now, you will all see

58:12.145 --> 58:14.148
what I've been trying
to tell you.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.301
All she has to do,

59:10.369 --> 59:12.871
is look at the cross
and breathe.

59:37.029 --> 59:39.630
Stick your head
through the hole and breathe.

59:45.837 --> 59:46.938
Johnny the keys.

59:48.673 --> 59:51.275
Lift that lid and you cheat God.

59:54.278 --> 59:57.014
Johnny, the keys.

01:00:03.154 --> 01:00:04.088
No.

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:28.245
No.

01:00:29.779 --> 01:00:32.081
No, breathe.

01:00:32.083 --> 01:00:33.117
Breathe.

01:00:34.285 --> 01:00:35.319
Breathe.

01:00:38.989 --> 01:00:40.991
God's will has been done.

01:00:44.328 --> 01:00:45.727
Please, take one breath.

01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:47.929
Take one breath.

01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:50.867
Come on, breathe.
One breath, breathe.

01:00:58.975 --> 01:01:03.313
I must thank you, Inquisitor,
you have saved us the trouble.

01:01:08.885 --> 01:01:11.455
She was not a witch.

01:01:15.325 --> 01:01:18.461
I think your test
confirms otherwise.

01:01:19.529 --> 01:01:21.097
This was her way out.

01:01:22.966 --> 01:01:26.036
She chose death over suffering.

01:01:38.981 --> 01:01:40.449
She's gone, Inquisitor.

01:01:42.985 --> 01:01:44.321
She's gone.

01:01:48.958 --> 01:01:50.958
We must burn the body.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.962
You will not touch her.

01:01:56.131 --> 01:01:57.166
She's gone.

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:02.239
She's gone.

01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:29.230
You must leave at once,
Inquisitor.

01:02:33.202 --> 01:02:34.236
And you as well.

01:02:36.372 --> 01:02:40.875
Yes, yes, you have betrayed me
by summoning him.

01:02:44.045 --> 01:02:47.180
No, somebody help.

01:02:47.182 --> 01:02:48.881
No.

01:02:48.883 --> 01:02:49.917
Inigo?

01:03:20.114 --> 01:03:21.314
It's not real.

01:03:25.987 --> 01:03:27.421
It's not real.

01:03:40.434 --> 01:03:43.234
They're not real.

01:04:38.024 --> 01:04:40.157
Inigo?

01:04:40.159 --> 01:04:44.230
Finally, I
no longer see them.

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:48.067
My God.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.568
The last act of the witch.

01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:53.406
We must pray for his soul.

01:05:41.519 --> 01:05:43.154
She has killed Peiter.

01:05:44.422 --> 01:05:46.459
The witch is dead.

01:05:48.227 --> 01:05:50.094
Her powers extend beyond death?

01:05:51.529 --> 01:05:54.197
No, this is not
the work of the witch.

01:05:54.199 --> 01:05:55.298
How do you know?

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.632
These wounds,

01:05:56.634 --> 01:05:59.470
are exactly
the same as Francisco's.

01:05:59.472 --> 01:06:01.105
It can't be one of ours.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.105
We wouldn't harm each other.

01:06:04.107 --> 01:06:05.675
No.

01:06:05.677 --> 01:06:06.978
No, not one of us.

01:06:07.812 --> 01:06:10.079
Who would do such a thing?

01:06:10.081 --> 01:06:15.217
Someone who is intent on
bringing discord to our harmony.

01:06:15.219 --> 01:06:16.354
Inquisitor.

01:06:32.437 --> 01:06:33.671
It would seem

01:06:35.206 --> 01:06:37.607
that there is
a murderer amongst us.

01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:40.677
Murder is a serious
accusation, Inquisitor.

01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:46.350
Indeed it is, Prior.

01:06:52.122 --> 01:06:54.625
Felix, you spent time
with Peiter.

01:06:55.726 --> 01:06:57.394
When did you see him last?

01:06:59.096 --> 01:07:00.863
We prayed together here.

01:07:00.865 --> 01:07:02.031
When?

01:07:02.733 --> 01:07:03.634
Sundown.

01:07:06.203 --> 01:07:08.505
Has anyone seen Peiter
after sundown?

01:07:10.307 --> 01:07:11.341
Anyone?

01:07:12.677 --> 01:07:13.711
Russo?

01:07:14.845 --> 01:07:16.312
Gregorio?

01:07:18.214 --> 01:07:19.416
Vicente?

01:07:20.651 --> 01:07:23.351
No one has seen
Peiter since sundown.

01:07:23.353 --> 01:07:24.819
I did.

01:07:24.821 --> 01:07:25.823
Good.

01:07:28.124 --> 01:07:29.658
When?

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.528
- Nearly dawn.
- Where?

01:07:34.698 --> 01:07:36.300
He was with you.

01:07:39.502 --> 01:07:41.170
Inquisitor?

01:07:43.774 --> 01:07:45.874
He was with the Inquisitor?

01:07:45.876 --> 01:07:47.143
Yes, Abbot.

01:07:48.144 --> 01:07:49.444
Can anyone confirm this?

01:07:49.446 --> 01:07:50.713
Ask the giant.

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:56.150
Johnny, is there
any truth in this?

01:07:56.152 --> 01:07:58.419
- No.
- No, no.

01:07:58.421 --> 01:07:59.723
Let him speak for himself.

01:08:04.226 --> 01:08:05.261
Yes.

01:08:08.331 --> 01:08:09.432
Well, here it is then.

01:08:10.499 --> 01:08:11.467
The truth.

01:08:12.368 --> 01:08:13.804
I do not deny it.

01:08:14.737 --> 01:08:16.402
Peiter came by my room.

01:08:16.404 --> 01:08:18.471
You were the last one
to see Peiter?

01:08:18.474 --> 01:08:20.274
He brought me information.

01:08:20.276 --> 01:08:23.210
I heard arguing
and muffled voices.

01:08:23.212 --> 01:08:24.612
There was no arguing.

01:08:24.613 --> 01:08:26.546
He heard you were
in league with the witch.

01:08:26.548 --> 01:08:28.180
And so you killed him for it.

01:08:28.183 --> 01:08:29.950
Do not give in to this madness.

01:08:29.952 --> 01:08:33.754
Who better? Who better
to re-create the crime than you?

01:08:33.756 --> 01:08:37.426
You arrived and immediately
her powers increased, why?

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:39.627
And then...

01:08:41.363 --> 01:08:44.865
Then we found these
taken from her cell.

01:08:44.867 --> 01:08:46.667
Yes, with all the others.

01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:48.836
What do you think about this?

01:08:48.837 --> 01:08:50.903
Those were not necessary.

01:08:50.904 --> 01:08:52.572
No...

01:08:52.573 --> 01:08:54.376
No, but you proved they were.

01:08:55.978 --> 01:08:58.747
What is this, Inquisitor?

01:09:00.281 --> 01:09:03.716
That is part
of my investigation.

01:09:03.718 --> 01:09:05.520
That is from Francisco's body.

01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:18.263
Do not forget
that I was summoned here

01:09:18.265 --> 01:09:19.501
after the first murder.

01:09:30.645 --> 01:09:33.548
It seems the Inquisitor
is familiar with this symbol.

01:09:34.816 --> 01:09:36.716
Obsessed demon.

01:09:38.352 --> 01:09:40.652
She summoned you here

01:09:40.654 --> 01:09:44.457
and you have done her bidding
from the very beginning.

01:09:47.595 --> 01:09:49.296
I trusted you.

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:55.769
Take this monster to the cage.

01:10:08.482 --> 01:10:11.820
Your investigation
is over, Inquisitor.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.855
Do not harm him.

01:10:16.857 --> 01:10:19.791
He will stand trial before God.

01:10:19.793 --> 01:10:23.995
And if he's found guilty,
then he will pay in blood.

01:10:23.997 --> 01:10:26.564
Then who will administer
the punishment?

01:10:26.566 --> 01:10:29.302
God or you?

01:11:47.113 --> 01:11:48.648
Johnny?

01:11:49.815 --> 01:11:51.082
Johnny?

01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.015
No.

01:13:42.226 --> 01:13:44.494
I must be dreaming.

01:13:48.832 --> 01:13:50.967
Do you remember what happened?

01:13:53.569 --> 01:13:54.637
You died.

01:13:58.708 --> 01:14:01.576
And I held your lifeless body.

01:14:04.514 --> 01:14:07.050
Do you remember what happened?

01:14:22.065 --> 01:14:23.666
Help me.

01:14:25.968 --> 01:14:28.668
How are you alive?

01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:30.271
Remember.

01:14:30.273 --> 01:14:31.908
Remember what?

01:14:33.109 --> 01:14:35.810
I do not know
what you want me to remember.

01:14:35.812 --> 01:14:37.180
- You must.
- No.

01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:44.087
I watched you die,
how is this possible?

01:14:46.555 --> 01:14:50.924
Remember or you will
suffer as I have.

01:14:50.926 --> 01:14:51.994
No.

01:14:52.961 --> 01:14:55.829
You will be helpless.

01:14:55.831 --> 01:14:57.866
You are dead.

01:15:11.813 --> 01:15:13.082
Am I?

01:15:32.633 --> 01:15:33.668
Johnny?

01:15:35.137 --> 01:15:36.171
Johnny?

01:15:38.172 --> 01:15:39.206
Johnny?

01:15:41.809 --> 01:15:43.111
Johnny, wake up.

01:15:50.918 --> 01:15:52.251
Johnny?

01:15:52.253 --> 01:15:53.788
Johnny, help me.

01:16:06.834 --> 01:16:08.569
Johnny, help!

01:16:10.205 --> 01:16:11.239
Look at me.

01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:15.276
Look at me.

01:16:25.019 --> 01:16:26.318
Please, no.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.887
No, do not look at her.

01:16:28.822 --> 01:16:30.825
I cannot look away.

01:16:33.227 --> 01:16:34.595
No.

01:16:39.199 --> 01:16:40.234
Johnny?

01:16:41.202 --> 01:16:42.769
Johnny, look at me.

01:16:47.875 --> 01:16:48.909
Stop it.

01:16:49.943 --> 01:16:51.978
Stop it. That's enough.

01:16:54.448 --> 01:16:56.082
Mateho,

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.720
help me.

01:17:06.359 --> 01:17:08.393
Help me.

01:17:08.395 --> 01:17:09.929
Johnny, no.

01:17:11.698 --> 01:17:13.265
Remember.

01:17:13.267 --> 01:17:15.366
I cannot.

01:17:15.368 --> 01:17:17.070
I cannot remember.

01:17:23.309 --> 01:17:24.942
No.

01:17:24.944 --> 01:17:26.344
No.

01:17:28.714 --> 01:17:29.848
Johnny!

01:17:44.397 --> 01:17:48.067
He's waiting for you.

01:17:54.474 --> 01:17:56.742
You just have to ask.

01:18:21.433 --> 01:18:23.168
Why?

01:18:42.887 --> 01:18:44.990
Come find me.

01:19:07.278 --> 01:19:09.414
Find me.

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:05.994
Who goes there?

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:26.013
Who goes there?

01:21:46.135 --> 01:21:47.069
Wake up.

01:21:53.207 --> 01:21:54.543
What happened?

01:21:57.011 --> 01:21:58.514
I...

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:02.183
I cannot explain.

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:06.053
Where is she?

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:10.659
She...

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:19.233
He was not in control.

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:24.338
Well, she controls the mind.
That's her power.

01:22:25.405 --> 01:22:28.576
He did not want to live.

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:31.345
That's what she wants.

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:35.483
She preys on
the fearful, the weak.

01:22:37.617 --> 01:22:39.284
And your ignorance has killed

01:22:39.286 --> 01:22:41.254
several of my Brothers,
Inquisitor.

01:22:42.690 --> 01:22:46.525
Now, huh,

01:22:46.527 --> 01:22:51.665
now a servant of the Devil
roams my halls because of you.

01:22:54.702 --> 01:22:56.336
I believenow.

01:22:58.071 --> 01:23:01.575
You think you could change your
mind in just a few moments?

01:23:11.351 --> 01:23:14.454
She rose from the dead...

01:23:15.789 --> 01:23:17.022
Yes.

01:23:18.225 --> 01:23:20.093
And she killed my friend.

01:23:25.297 --> 01:23:27.132
Revenge is not God's will.

01:23:28.735 --> 01:23:31.036
Then she will
be brought to justice.

01:23:34.374 --> 01:23:36.009
And God will decide.

01:23:37.476 --> 01:23:39.176
Our belief in God

01:23:39.178 --> 01:23:42.616
is all we have
to fight this evil.

01:23:45.719 --> 01:23:46.753
Abbot.

01:23:48.421 --> 01:23:49.622
What do you want?

01:23:54.661 --> 01:23:55.695
The Prior.

01:24:07.306 --> 01:24:10.274
Please, you must believe me.

01:24:10.276 --> 01:24:13.310
I cannot, after what happened.

01:24:13.312 --> 01:24:15.712
You do not agree with the Abbot?

01:24:15.714 --> 01:24:19.650
No, so I think you
should have been let out.

01:24:19.652 --> 01:24:21.687
You wish to leave me
in the dungeon.

01:24:22.722 --> 01:24:24.555
Perhaps so, Inquisitor.

01:24:24.557 --> 01:24:28.659
I told you I had nothing
to do with Peiter's death.

01:24:28.661 --> 01:24:29.828
You had the symbol.

01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:32.598
My boy.

01:24:34.266 --> 01:24:38.202
Abbot, Abbot.

01:24:39.437 --> 01:24:40.371
What shall we do?

01:24:44.643 --> 01:24:45.678
Gregorio?

01:24:46.712 --> 01:24:48.579
No, listen.

01:24:48.581 --> 01:24:49.614
Wait.

01:24:51.149 --> 01:24:52.216
Listen.

01:25:08.199 --> 01:25:09.602
Felix.

01:25:13.638 --> 01:25:15.805
Felix.

01:25:15.807 --> 01:25:18.543
What? What? What is it?

01:25:19.711 --> 01:25:22.280
I saw Peiter.

01:25:29.787 --> 01:25:30.822
Eduardo.

01:25:37.327 --> 01:25:40.830
Gregorio, he...

01:25:40.832 --> 01:25:42.467
He, he what?

01:25:44.569 --> 01:25:45.670
Look at me.

01:25:46.738 --> 01:25:48.738
Look at me.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.273
Did he take his own life?

01:25:55.379 --> 01:25:57.212
We cannot trust our eyes.

01:25:57.214 --> 01:25:59.649
Anything we see
can be turned against us.

01:25:59.651 --> 01:26:00.882
She will kill us all.

01:26:00.884 --> 01:26:01.883
No.

01:26:01.885 --> 01:26:03.420
We cannot stop her?

01:26:06.623 --> 01:26:07.524
Abbot.

01:26:11.495 --> 01:26:12.530
Where are you going?

01:26:31.948 --> 01:26:33.581
What is it?

01:26:33.583 --> 01:26:36.186
Just illusions.

01:26:37.353 --> 01:26:38.387
We must leave.

01:26:39.321 --> 01:26:40.789
We're not safe here.

01:26:40.791 --> 01:26:42.322
Abandon the abbey?

01:26:42.324 --> 01:26:44.260
With the abbot gone,
we are lost.

01:26:45.996 --> 01:26:47.731
We'll go through
the dining room.

01:26:50.599 --> 01:26:51.935
This way.

01:26:58.407 --> 01:26:59.476
Inquisitor?

01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:02.578
I'm not leaving.

01:27:05.648 --> 01:27:06.680
We must go.

01:27:06.682 --> 01:27:07.583
No.

01:27:09.518 --> 01:27:11.487
No, I have been called
here for a reason.

01:27:13.022 --> 01:27:14.590
I have to deal with this.

01:27:15.725 --> 01:27:16.792
I will find the others.

01:27:17.727 --> 01:27:18.761
Go.

01:27:20.496 --> 01:27:21.963
You will stand against her.

01:27:21.965 --> 01:27:23.865
Despite what the abbot
made you believe,

01:27:23.867 --> 01:27:25.600
I am not in league with her.

01:27:32.575 --> 01:27:35.876
If you are staying, I will stay.

01:27:35.878 --> 01:27:36.912
No.

01:27:38.646 --> 01:27:39.849
No.

01:27:42.450 --> 01:27:43.619
I will stay as well.

01:27:47.923 --> 01:27:50.425
Very well, we keep together.

01:28:16.618 --> 01:28:18.486
You are outmatched.

01:28:20.822 --> 01:28:22.022
Abbot?

01:28:24.526 --> 01:28:26.959
No one move. Stay together.

01:28:26.961 --> 01:28:29.428
You are all going to die.

01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:30.763
Why is he doing this?

01:28:30.765 --> 01:28:32.033
It is not the Abbot.

01:28:33.301 --> 01:28:35.670
- What is that?
- Do not listen to it.

01:28:37.471 --> 01:28:38.805
Stay together.

01:28:38.807 --> 01:28:39.872
There is
something here with us.

01:28:39.874 --> 01:28:40.940
No.

01:29:06.667 --> 01:29:09.168
There, you see?

01:29:09.170 --> 01:29:10.504
Illusions.

01:29:11.806 --> 01:29:13.504
I saw nothing.

01:29:13.506 --> 01:29:15.106
I just heard voices.

01:29:15.108 --> 01:29:16.844
There are many types
of illusion.

01:29:19.546 --> 01:29:20.614
Mateho.

01:30:01.854 --> 01:30:03.687
Felix?

01:30:05.158 --> 01:30:06.559
Eduardo?

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.481
Eduardo?

01:31:08.955 --> 01:31:09.989
Felix?

01:31:13.124 --> 01:31:14.592
Felix, what happened?

01:31:16.094 --> 01:31:19.030
They have attacked me.

01:31:20.065 --> 01:31:22.732
He haunted me
to come to the dungeon.

01:31:22.734 --> 01:31:23.802
The dungeon?

01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:27.471
Why? There's nothing down there.

01:31:32.711 --> 01:31:33.945
Felix?

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:38.615
Felix, where did we first meet?

01:31:42.653 --> 01:31:43.888
In the sanctum.

01:31:57.035 --> 01:31:58.236
Release me.

01:32:02.706 --> 01:32:05.142
Inquisitor, do not look at her.

01:32:11.116 --> 01:32:12.682
I can't, I can't.

01:33:41.404 --> 01:33:42.637
Inigo.

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:45.708
Inigo.

01:33:55.051 --> 01:33:57.418
I thought...

01:34:07.230 --> 01:34:08.331
Vicente.

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:20.309
Vicente, put the knife down.

01:34:22.878 --> 01:34:23.912
No.

01:34:49.404 --> 01:34:50.336
Are you real?

01:34:50.338 --> 01:34:51.373
Yes.

01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:57.245
Do not let
my appearance fool you.

01:34:59.748 --> 01:35:01.048
Nor mine.

01:35:06.754 --> 01:35:07.988
I had to make sure.

01:35:15.362 --> 01:35:17.264
The others?

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.102
I have not seen him
since the tunnels.

01:35:26.173 --> 01:35:28.209
- I heard screaming.
- Vicente...

01:35:30.077 --> 01:35:31.011
He's gone.

01:35:36.083 --> 01:35:37.451
God, have mercy.

01:35:41.222 --> 01:35:42.389
What do we do?

01:36:02.408 --> 01:36:03.943
We ask.

01:37:04.537 --> 01:37:06.372
We need to go deeper.

01:37:10.343 --> 01:37:11.411
In the dungeon?

01:37:13.578 --> 01:37:15.113
The sanctum.

01:37:18.183 --> 01:37:19.951
I never told you where that is.

01:37:21.454 --> 01:37:23.256
You did not have to.

01:37:57.022 --> 01:37:58.154
Grab her feet.

01:38:01.058 --> 01:38:02.293
Open the door.

01:38:07.632 --> 01:38:08.966
Let's tie her down.

01:38:10.569 --> 01:38:12.201
Just tie her.

01:38:12.203 --> 01:38:13.971
Let's put an end to this now.

01:38:20.244 --> 01:38:22.412
First, we will bleed her

01:38:22.414 --> 01:38:23.680
and then we'll burn her.

01:38:23.682 --> 01:38:26.682
- Stop it. This is not...
- No.

01:38:26.684 --> 01:38:28.185
It is the only way.

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:31.322
Take a torch each of you.

01:38:38.094 --> 01:38:41.163
Purge the evil, purge the sins.

01:38:41.165 --> 01:38:43.966
Purge the evil, purge the sins.

01:38:43.968 --> 01:38:46.001
Purge the evil, purge the sins.

01:38:46.003 --> 01:38:48.503
Purge the evil, purge the sins.

01:38:48.505 --> 01:38:51.139
Purge the evil, purge the sins.

01:40:00.642 --> 01:40:03.109
Purge the evil, purge the sins.

01:40:03.111 --> 01:40:04.579
Purge the evil, purge the sins.

01:40:04.581 --> 01:40:07.216
Please, not again.

01:40:08.351 --> 01:40:09.817
Purge the sins.

01:40:09.819 --> 01:40:13.420
Purge the evil, purge the sins.

01:40:13.422 --> 01:40:16.258
Purge the evil, purge the sins.

01:40:55.597 --> 01:40:56.765
Help me.

01:41:10.144 --> 01:41:11.178
I remember.

01:41:14.415 --> 01:41:16.649
Hear our prayers.

01:41:19.387 --> 01:41:22.156
Shed your light
and expose this dark.

01:41:27.662 --> 01:41:31.330
Our sins are now her sins.

01:41:31.332 --> 01:41:34.133
Take this vile spirit

01:41:34.135 --> 01:41:37.738
and cleanse our souls
and free us from temptation.

01:41:41.342 --> 01:41:45.811
This carnal contract
ends tonight

01:41:45.813 --> 01:41:52.653
with this holy weapon
to purge our wicked sins.

01:41:54.187 --> 01:41:56.223
Scipio. Stay where you are.

01:41:57.358 --> 01:41:58.924
Put the dagger down.

01:41:58.926 --> 01:42:00.558
Inquisitor?

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:01.795
I said put it down.

01:42:11.539 --> 01:42:15.239
The abbot has something
to confess to all of you.

01:42:15.241 --> 01:42:19.613
Look at her and tell them what
you did, what you always do.

01:42:22.683 --> 01:42:24.818
I bring purity into our hearts.

01:42:25.752 --> 01:42:28.455
Tell them, you bastard
or I will.

01:42:29.723 --> 01:42:31.723
Now you still do not understand.

01:42:31.725 --> 01:42:32.726
I was there.

01:42:33.894 --> 01:42:36.894
20 years ago, I was
here in this room.

01:42:36.896 --> 01:42:38.565
I do what I must do.

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:45.403
To purify our souls, we must
purge our sins inside them.

01:42:45.405 --> 01:42:47.540
You broke your vows to God.

01:42:48.641 --> 01:42:50.910
He has committed
unspeakable acts.

01:42:52.211 --> 01:42:53.913
Posed as a pillar of strength.

01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:57.281
Now confess.

01:42:57.283 --> 01:42:58.850
You made her what she is.

01:42:58.852 --> 01:43:00.851
- Confess.
- No, no.

01:43:00.853 --> 01:43:05.522
All the women are destined to
serve the Devil, they want it.

01:43:05.524 --> 01:43:06.525
No.

01:43:13.565 --> 01:43:14.600
Release her.

01:43:25.243 --> 01:43:26.412
How many?

01:43:29.782 --> 01:43:32.251
How far have you gone
to keep your secret?

01:43:36.421 --> 01:43:38.222
You killed Peiter.

01:43:38.991 --> 01:43:42.325
You killed Peiter
to turn them against me.

01:43:42.327 --> 01:43:46.398
Abbot, is this true?

01:43:49.701 --> 01:43:51.469
I did it to protect you.

01:43:58.644 --> 01:44:02.547
You! You deserve to die.

01:44:10.723 --> 01:44:12.688
Killing you will leave me

01:44:12.690 --> 01:44:14.692
no better
than the creature you are.

01:44:17.029 --> 01:44:20.362
God will decide your punishment.

01:44:20.364 --> 01:44:21.965
Kill him.

01:44:21.967 --> 01:44:24.066
Kill him, I have led
you to this moment.

01:44:24.068 --> 01:44:26.335
It is not my place
to take his life.

01:44:26.337 --> 01:44:28.070
He took my life.

01:44:28.072 --> 01:44:30.506
Just as you have taken life.

01:44:30.508 --> 01:44:33.709
He destroyed my soul,
he damned an innocent girl.

01:44:33.711 --> 01:44:35.379
I will not kill for you.

01:44:37.481 --> 01:44:38.814
Stay back.

01:44:38.816 --> 01:44:40.649
I will have my vengeance.

01:44:40.651 --> 01:44:42.854
It is over, do not do this.

01:44:43.755 --> 01:44:45.488
He will be mine.

01:44:45.490 --> 01:44:47.358
He's not yours to take.

01:44:54.397 --> 01:44:55.833
Get back!

01:45:00.370 --> 01:45:02.272
You could have saved me.

01:46:00.896 --> 01:46:02.098
What will you do?

01:46:06.468 --> 01:46:07.902
It will take some time

01:46:07.904 --> 01:46:10.841
to sort out my place
in the world.

01:46:13.042 --> 01:46:14.710
You will always be welcome here.

01:46:20.583 --> 01:46:22.518
Will the Inquisition
close the abbey?

01:46:24.053 --> 01:46:28.858
No, this place has
purpose once more.

01:46:31.127 --> 01:46:32.795
Thanks to you.

01:46:33.762 --> 01:46:35.397
God sent you to us.

01:46:37.565 --> 01:46:38.901
You wrote the letter.

01:46:44.206 --> 01:46:46.408
The abbey is in good hands.

01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.015
Thank you, Inquisitor.

01:47:57.211 --> 01:47:58.846
Come away from there.
