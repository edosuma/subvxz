00:07.123 --> 00:08.525
Let's say you guys are at

00:08.560 --> 00:10.899
the greatest drag race in history,

00:10.933 --> 00:13.839
because all the cars are
from TVs and movies, huh?

00:13.874 --> 00:15.544
Who you putting your money on?

00:15.578 --> 00:17.748
<i>Umm, how about the Delorean,
from Back To The Future?</i>

00:17.782 --> 00:19.017
Can't use a time machine.

00:19.052 --> 00:20.691
You said any car.

00:20.725 --> 00:22.525
'Cause that's totally unfair, then.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.128
<i>Now you're down to
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.</i>

00:24.162 --> 00:25.765
- [Laughter]
- Come on.

00:25.799 --> 00:27.235
<i>All right, how about
Kitt from Knight Rider?</i>

00:27.269 --> 00:28.812
- Nice choice.
- It can talk.

00:28.846 --> 00:30.249
I don't think talking is gonna help you

00:30.283 --> 00:31.754
in a match of speed.

00:31.788 --> 00:33.392
You know, he's, like, bothering his car

00:33.426 --> 00:34.798
when it's trying to win a race.

00:34.833 --> 00:36.469
[Laughter]

00:36.503 --> 00:37.904
- Bry?
- The trans am.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.440
<i>Smokey and the bandit.</i>

00:39.474 --> 00:41.012
Trans... ohh...

00:41.046 --> 00:42.450
So with or without Sally field?

00:42.484 --> 00:44.460
With, come on. It's with Sally field.

00:44.494 --> 00:45.696
All right, what would you take?

00:45.730 --> 00:47.532
What's gonna blow my doors off?

00:47.566 --> 00:49.974
<i>The Gran Torino from Starsky & Hutch.</i>

00:50.008 --> 00:51.611
- Ooh.
- With or without Huggy Bear?

00:51.645 --> 00:55.620
[Laughter]

<i>Hello! Welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,</i>

01:34.288 --> 01:36.661
the only show that takes Groot to the root.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.164
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.666
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.403
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:41.438 --> 01:43.407
Now, some people want to
know the meaning of life.

01:43.442 --> 01:44.675
I just want to know what happened

01:44.709 --> 01:46.111
at the Secret Stash this week.

01:46.145 --> 01:47.113
Wrestling.

01:47.147 --> 01:48.751
Were you into it as a kid?

01:48.785 --> 01:52.990
[Funky disco music]

01:53.024 --> 01:55.095
- Hey, guys. How are you doing?
- How's it going today?

01:55.130 --> 01:57.098
- What's up, man?
- My name's Christopher Daniels.

01:57.133 --> 01:59.502
This is Frankie Kazarian, and
we're professional wrestlers

01:59.536 --> 02:00.940
that happen to be comic book fans,

02:00.974 --> 02:02.443
and we wanted to talk to you

02:02.477 --> 02:04.215
about a comic book that
we wrote and created,

02:04.249 --> 02:07.154
and hopefully we can get you
to carry it in the Secret Stash.

02:07.188 --> 02:09.056
- Well, let's check it out.
- All right.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.236
- So is this you two?
- Yeah, this is us.

02:18.270 --> 02:20.072
- That's us.
- So what made you guys

02:20.106 --> 02:22.474
want to make a comic book
featuring yourselves in it?

02:22.509 --> 02:25.312
I wanted to make something
for the younger wrestling fan,

02:25.346 --> 02:26.748
like, something for, you know,

02:26.784 --> 02:28.918
six, eight, ten-year-old kids.

02:28.953 --> 02:31.923
So we actually are friends
with Art Baltazar and Franco,

02:31.958 --> 02:33.693
the guys that did the
art for the comic book,

02:33.728 --> 02:35.531
and I knew that they
were the masters of, like,

02:35.566 --> 02:36.935
the "all-ages" comic.

02:36.969 --> 02:39.371
So we wrote a story
about Frankie and myself

02:39.406 --> 02:41.574
engaging with action cat and adventure bug,

02:41.608 --> 02:43.443
and next thing you know,
there was a comic book.

02:43.478 --> 02:44.444
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

02:44.478 --> 02:46.346
Oh, my goodness.

02:46.380 --> 02:48.948
I was a big fan of, like,
the old-school WWF Wrestlers...

02:48.982 --> 02:51.387
Hulk Hogan, Randy "macho man" Savage.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.787
- Andre The Giant.
- Andre The Giant, the ultimate,

02:53.821 --> 02:55.222
the biggest of all time.

02:55.256 --> 02:57.087
I remember him wrestling Hulk hogan,

02:57.122 --> 02:59.522
and, you know, their big thing
was Hulk body-slamming him,

02:59.557 --> 03:01.285
like, a 700-pound-plus guy.

03:01.285 --> 03:02.758
I mean, it would be the equivalent

03:02.792 --> 03:04.191
of you lifting Bryan

03:04.226 --> 03:05.391
and body-slaing him right now, right?

03:05.425 --> 03:06.557
- Yeah.
- I'd love to see that.

03:06.591 --> 03:07.624
Let's try it.

03:07.658 --> 03:10.794
[Laughter]

03:10.829 --> 03:12.228
So did the comics
get you into wrestling,

03:12.262 --> 03:13.628
or did the wrestling get you into comics?

03:13.663 --> 03:15.129
It seemed hand-in-hand, man.

03:15.164 --> 03:16.565
Like, when I was young,
like, I loved 'em both,

03:16.599 --> 03:18.034
and it was almost like wrestling was, like,

03:18.068 --> 03:19.766
a real-life comic book.

03:19.801 --> 03:22.033
Basically, as close as you
can get to a comic book on TV.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.035
I didn't realize it until a couple years

03:24.070 --> 03:26.037
into wrestling that
there is a huge crossover

03:26.072 --> 03:28.638
between wrestling fans and comic book fans.

03:28.672 --> 03:30.307
Over the last couple years,

03:30.342 --> 03:32.211
we've actually incorporated
our love of comics

03:32.246 --> 03:33.614
into our wrestling gear.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.451
This was actually a show that we did

03:35.485 --> 03:37.454
at the San Diego Comic-Con
a couple years back.

03:37.489 --> 03:40.794
We did a match where it was
Magneto versus Captain America.

03:40.828 --> 03:42.897
And, of course, captain
America won, because...

03:42.932 --> 03:45.497
Yeah, I mean, you can't have
kids thinking that evil wins.

03:45.531 --> 03:47.264
Never, never, never.

03:47.298 --> 03:49.936
Now with CGI, we can see
people flying through the air,

03:49.971 --> 03:51.639
but back then, that was really the only way

03:51.673 --> 03:54.476
you saw two huge, muscular
grown men jumping off ropes

03:54.510 --> 03:56.476
and slamming each other into the ground.

03:56.511 --> 03:58.910
Every wrestling match has
got a good guy and a bad guy,

03:58.944 --> 04:00.611
and you hope to see good triumph.

04:00.646 --> 04:02.410
Sometimes it doesn't.
Sometimes the bad guys win.

04:02.444 --> 04:04.011
It is very comic book.

04:04.045 --> 04:06.012
Oh, yeah, I mean, you
can see the influences

04:06.046 --> 04:07.982
are all over wrestling from comic books,

04:08.017 --> 04:10.417
from the over-the-top evil bad guys

04:10.451 --> 04:12.953
to the bright, colorful costumes.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.354
Or the lack of costume.

04:14.389 --> 04:15.990
The idea that you've got a job to do,

04:16.024 --> 04:19.426
so you strip down to
your underwear to do it.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.796
Do you guys have,
like, a finishing move?

04:20.831 --> 04:22.031
We do have a finishing move.

04:22.065 --> 04:23.499
We call it the "celebrity rehab."

04:23.534 --> 04:26.302
Basically, I flip a guy
backwards, upside down,

04:26.336 --> 04:28.470
- right into his awaiting boot.
- Oh.

04:28.504 --> 04:30.537
- Right in the face.
- Would you like us to show you?

04:30.572 --> 04:33.039
[Stammering] I think I get the picture.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.541
Okay, just making sure.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.208
Look, obviously you're in no condition

04:36.242 --> 04:37.743
to take a boot to the face,

04:37.778 --> 04:39.005
but I bet you this thumb

04:39.005 --> 04:40.980
could go one-on-one with
one of these guys, huh?

04:41.014 --> 04:42.090
A little thumb-wrestling?

04:42.090 --> 04:44.549
I'll have you know Frankie
is undefeated in 14 years

04:44.584 --> 04:45.783
- of thumb-wrestling. Right?
- Yes.

04:45.965 --> 04:47.555
I'll have you know he's
had his thumb up his ass

04:47.555 --> 04:49.252
- for eight years as well.
- That right?

04:49.287 --> 04:50.921
Wow, I don't know if
I want to wrestle...

04:50.955 --> 04:51.858
but, you know, but I'm telling you,

04:51.858 --> 04:53.741
I got a good feeling.
He's got something in him.

04:53.741 --> 04:55.054
Well, let's warm this up a little bit.

04:55.224 --> 04:56.762
You ready for this? Ready
for this? Ready for this?

04:56.762 --> 04:57.672
- Let's do this.
- Hold on.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.102
What are you doing to him?
I'm gonna do that to you too.

04:59.102 --> 05:02.601
- Ow!
- All right.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.235
Join hands.

05:04.270 --> 05:06.436
Both: One, two, three, four...

05:06.471 --> 05:08.541
I declare a thumb war.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.942
Oh, whoa! That was close.

05:10.976 --> 05:13.378
- Whoa, whoa!
- Agh!

05:13.412 --> 05:14.945
Ooh! That was close.

05:14.979 --> 05:16.079
Agh!

05:16.113 --> 05:18.915
[All shouting]

05:18.949 --> 05:21.418
One, two, three, four!

05:21.452 --> 05:24.052
Ming Chen for the win!

05:24.087 --> 05:26.785
- That was a fast count, right?
- He got me.

05:26.820 --> 05:28.919
In our business, that's
called "doing the favors."

05:28.954 --> 05:29.953
That's right.

05:29.987 --> 05:32.453
Exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah.

05:32.487 --> 05:33.986
Well, you guys did us a favor,

05:34.021 --> 05:35.722
you know, by obviously letting him win,

05:35.758 --> 05:37.761
so we'll definitely buy
the books from you today.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.129
What are we looking at here,

05:39.163 --> 05:40.763
if I were to buy them outright?

05:40.798 --> 05:42.399
If we got $1 a copy,

05:42.433 --> 05:44.169
and then you guys could
sell it for $2 or $3

05:44.203 --> 05:45.937
or whatever you thought would be fair.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.271
- How does that sound?
- Definitely fair.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.042
- Definitely doable.
- Awesome. 25 books there.

05:50.076 --> 05:51.410
So $25 for you.

05:51.445 --> 05:54.347
- Yeah, perfect.
- There you go.

05:54.381 --> 05:55.915
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you so much.

05:55.949 --> 05:57.749
Who can I send the
medical bill about my thumb?

05:57.783 --> 05:59.716
[Laughter]

05:59.751 --> 06:00.916
Hey guys!

06:00.951 --> 06:03.949
Oh! Secret Stashley! Hello.

06:10.750 --> 06:11.917
- Hi.
- Hey, I'm Sarah.

06:11.917 --> 06:13.384
I called about the Cyberman bust.

06:13.418 --> 06:14.619
<i>- Dr. Who, right?
- Yes.</i>

06:14.654 --> 06:15.674
Got it right here.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.651
<i>There he is. Big Dr. Who fan?</i>

06:17.685 --> 06:19.956
Yes. I went to Comic-Con as a soothsayer.

06:19.991 --> 06:21.657
What was that?

06:21.691 --> 06:22.993
You don't know what a soothsayer is?

06:23.027 --> 06:24.262
I've got to be honest with you.

06:24.297 --> 06:25.631
<i>I'm not the biggest Dr. Who fan.</i>

06:25.665 --> 06:27.099
It always sounds like it's a little bit

06:27.134 --> 06:28.901
- too British for my taste.
- Come on.

06:28.935 --> 06:30.634
It's like, the doctor's gonna fight

06:30.668 --> 06:32.268
some monster or something,
and then in the middle of it,

06:32.303 --> 06:33.503
he's like, "oh, hold on. It's tea time."

06:33.538 --> 06:34.572
[Laughter]

06:34.606 --> 06:36.274
Ah, look at this guy.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.109
I mean, tell me that
doesn't look like any robot

06:38.143 --> 06:39.309
you ever seen before.

06:39.343 --> 06:40.676
Ah, love it.

06:48.652 --> 06:49.787
What's his name?

06:49.821 --> 06:50.922
- Cyberman.
- Cyberman?

06:50.956 --> 06:52.289
- Yeah.
- What's he do?

06:52.324 --> 06:53.856
It's basically a race of cybermen,

06:53.891 --> 06:56.090
and their mission is to go to worlds

06:56.125 --> 06:59.130
and convert everybody to a Cyberman,

06:59.164 --> 07:02.701
and they run around saying,
"we're gonna delete you."

07:02.736 --> 07:06.103
You hear this, and it doesn't
make me want to watch it.

07:06.137 --> 07:08.538
<i>What is the origin story of Dr. Who?</i>

07:08.572 --> 07:10.476
He comes from a race of time lords,

07:10.510 --> 07:12.315
and he goes out trying to right wrongs.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.482
<i>It's almost like quantum leap,</i>

07:14.517 --> 07:16.218
but it's British.

07:16.252 --> 07:18.054
For God's sake, throw a punch.

07:18.088 --> 07:20.023
[Laughter]

07:20.057 --> 07:21.457
<i>When did you get into Dr. Who?</i>

07:21.491 --> 07:23.356
- About two years ago, actually.
- Two years?

07:23.390 --> 07:25.993
Yeah, my husband and I
were planning a wedding,

07:26.027 --> 07:28.526
and just the stress of everyday work

07:28.561 --> 07:30.994
and barely seeing each
other, we only had, like,

07:31.028 --> 07:32.528
an allotted amount of time with each other.

07:32.563 --> 07:34.064
Okay, so you're almost like...

07:34.099 --> 07:35.899
what's it called? Like ships in the night?

07:35.934 --> 07:37.666
Yeah, for a while there, we were.

07:37.701 --> 07:39.667
<i>And so how does Dr.
Who come into play, then?</i>

07:39.702 --> 07:41.736
Our friends told us we
would really get into it,

07:41.770 --> 07:44.907
and then finally we sat down
and got online and watched it.

07:44.941 --> 07:46.475
So you've seen every episode now?

07:46.509 --> 07:49.644
I've seen 9 through the current doctor.

07:49.679 --> 07:51.314
How many doctors have there been?

07:51.348 --> 07:53.249
- Technically?
- Technically, yes.

07:53.283 --> 07:56.018
Technically, 13, but
we're on doctor 12 now.

07:56.053 --> 07:59.027
So what if I was saying,
"no, don't go technical"?

07:59.061 --> 08:00.596
- Ah, 12.
- 12?

08:00.631 --> 08:03.234
- Yeah.
- Tell the difference.

08:03.268 --> 08:04.869
What's the difference?

08:04.904 --> 08:06.438
There's the War Doctor.

08:06.472 --> 08:09.108
All right, so we're looking to get $125.

08:09.142 --> 08:10.543
Should I box him up?

08:10.577 --> 08:11.877
I was wondering if you could do

08:11.911 --> 08:14.278
a little bit better than that.

08:14.313 --> 08:17.482
It's an anniversary present for my husband.

08:17.517 --> 08:18.750
$115?

08:18.784 --> 08:20.719
I was thinking, like, $90.

08:20.753 --> 08:23.722
Uh, I... no, I can't do $90.

08:23.757 --> 08:26.293
Can you meet me at $100?

08:26.327 --> 08:29.731
Mm, yeah, we could do 100 bucks.

08:29.765 --> 08:33.932
- Thank you.
- $100, please.

08:33.967 --> 08:35.933
So what's hubby gonna
say when he opens this up?

08:35.967 --> 08:38.403
Oh, he's gonna be so
excited. Thank you, guys.

08:38.438 --> 08:39.605
- Happy anniversary.
- Bye.

08:39.639 --> 08:40.639

08:48.211 --> 08:50.442
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

08:50.476 --> 08:52.945
- Oh.
- Nice to meet you finally.

08:52.980 --> 08:55.417
Secret Stashley, hello.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.019
- Hi. Hi, Ming.
- Hey, how you doing?

08:57.053 --> 08:58.453
- Thank you.
- What's up, Bryan?

08:58.488 --> 08:59.656
- Hello.
- How are you?

08:59.690 --> 09:00.956
All right. How've you been?

09:00.956 --> 09:02.839
I'm good. It's been a
while since I've seen you.

09:02.990 --> 09:04.826
Folks, I work in the
movie business, which means

09:04.860 --> 09:07.660
I'm pretty much useless in
every aspect of real life,

09:07.761 --> 09:09.530
so I got me one of them assistants

09:09.564 --> 09:11.133
you hear so much about.

09:11.167 --> 09:13.371
Her name is Ashley. She drives me around.

09:13.405 --> 09:15.173
She runs errands and stuff like that.

09:15.207 --> 09:17.379
When she's not doing that,
she does a show called

09:17.414 --> 09:20.014
<i>Jay and silent Bob's
top five comic countdown</i>

09:20.048 --> 09:21.782
<i>with Secret Stashley.</i>

09:21.816 --> 09:23.384
Gather round, Stasheketeers.

09:23.419 --> 09:25.353
It's time for another episode

09:25.387 --> 09:28.059
<i>of Jay and silent Bob's
top five comic countdown.</i>

09:28.093 --> 09:30.694
The idea is, she
does the top five comics

09:30.729 --> 09:32.497
at Jay and silent Bob's Secret Stash.

09:32.531 --> 09:35.635
The information is provided
by our very own Ming and Mike,

09:35.669 --> 09:38.842
but she only really knows the
Secret Stash from a distance,

09:38.876 --> 09:40.678
from the other side of the country.

09:40.712 --> 09:43.480
So I said "we got to send you
back east to see the store,

09:43.514 --> 09:45.479
"immerse yourself in
the world of the stash,

09:45.513 --> 09:47.349
and meet the guys."

09:47.383 --> 09:50.150
I envision this week as
being a baptism in fire.

09:50.185 --> 09:52.320
- Oh, fun.
- What you're gonna gain

09:52.354 --> 09:54.156
this week is going to be immeasurable

09:54.190 --> 09:56.991
in terms of
dollars or, I mean...

09:57.025 --> 09:58.692
it's gonna be fantastic.

Is that your way of saying
she's not getting paid?

10:02.028 --> 10:03.496
Damn it!

10:03.531 --> 10:05.400
He'll sneak it in on you. Watch out.

10:05.435 --> 10:07.904
It's not a job. It's an adventure.

10:07.938 --> 10:09.538
This is like a vacation.

10:09.572 --> 10:12.206
- Oh, no.
- Whoa, whoa...

10:12.240 --> 10:13.540
No, vacations are fun.

10:13.574 --> 10:15.741
[Laughter]

10:15.775 --> 10:18.471
It's a 2014 Psylocke statue,

10:18.506 --> 10:20.339
only available at the San Diego Comic-Con.

10:20.374 --> 10:22.248
- Oh, my gosh.
- They're not making any more.

10:22.412 --> 10:23.779
- Good choice, girl. Good choice.
- Oh, yeah.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.852
There's a handful of space
programs, when I'm a kid,

10:27.886 --> 10:30.621
that are in reruns, that
I'm like, "space sucks."

10:30.655 --> 10:32.590
[Laughter]

10:32.624 --> 10:34.425
<i>Space: 1999...</i>

10:35.352 --> 10:38.523
the most boring treatment
of space ever encountered.

10:38.557 --> 10:40.955
I mean, when the best space show on TV

10:40.990 --> 10:42.656
<i>in the '70s is space nuts...</i>

10:42.690 --> 10:44.858
<i>The far out space nuts.</i>

10:44.892 --> 10:46.625
I mean, that's really saying a lot

10:46.659 --> 10:49.026
about the quality of space
programming back in the day.

10:49.061 --> 10:51.127
<i>- Yeah.
- Give it to lost in space.</i>

10:51.161 --> 10:53.126
<i>It's true, and you
were a lost in space guy,</i>

10:53.160 --> 10:54.826
but even that, to me, was boring.

10:54.860 --> 10:56.327
It was just, like, the robot's like,

10:56.361 --> 10:58.629
"danger, danger"...
there's always danger.

10:58.664 --> 11:00.831
Space was defined by George Lucas for me,

11:00.865 --> 11:03.671
so any attempt at it on TV was just like,

11:03.706 --> 11:06.772
<i>"ugh, this is poor man's Star Wars."</i>

11:06.807 --> 11:08.809
[Laughter]

11:20.260 --> 11:22.363
Well, right now we're
pretty well stocked,

11:22.398 --> 11:25.631
so basically we're kind
of in a sit-and-wait mode.

11:25.666 --> 11:27.098
- Okay.
- We're kind of like...

11:27.132 --> 11:28.565
<i>if you ever watch national geographic,</i>

11:28.600 --> 11:29.969
you'll see lions just waiting for,

11:30.003 --> 11:31.874
like, a pack of elks to walk by?

11:31.908 --> 11:33.775
That's kind of how we are.
We're kind of like lions.

11:33.809 --> 11:35.609
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

11:35.644 --> 11:37.144
We're waiting for the meat
to come in, ready to strike.

11:37.178 --> 11:38.145
We'll wait for that first customer

11:38.180 --> 11:39.547
to walk in, your first customer.

11:39.581 --> 11:41.080
- That's always special.
- Fun.

11:41.114 --> 11:42.381
And we'll see what happens.

11:42.416 --> 11:44.386
So we only had Ashley for seven days.

11:44.421 --> 11:47.390
I'm thinking, "how on earth
can we teach her everything

11:47.425 --> 11:50.822
about comic book retailing in seven days?"

11:50.857 --> 11:55.130
I wasn't looking for
everything, just an overview.

11:55.165 --> 11:57.499
I thought, "let's just
throw her right into the fire

11:57.534 --> 11:58.934
as soon as possible," you know?

11:58.969 --> 12:01.138
You only learn by doing.

12:01.173 --> 12:02.641
That's my motto.

12:02.675 --> 12:04.043
Hi.

12:04.077 --> 12:05.842
- Hi.
- How you doing?

12:05.876 --> 12:08.314
Can I see the Psylocke
statue that's in the front?

12:08.348 --> 12:10.052
Absolutely. Ming, will
you grab that statue, please?

12:10.086 --> 12:11.554
- Yeah, no problem.
- Good choice, girl.

12:11.588 --> 12:13.422
- Oh, yeah.
- Good choice.

12:20.133 --> 12:21.936
Oh, that is so cool.

12:21.970 --> 12:25.174
It's the 2014 X-Force Psylocke statue,

12:25.208 --> 12:27.042
only available at the San Diego Comic-Con.

12:27.076 --> 12:29.275
- Oh, my gosh.
- They're not making any more.

12:29.309 --> 12:31.608
I like her stance, love the sword.

12:31.643 --> 12:33.177
Even her nails are painted.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.743
Oh, my God. That's awesome.

12:34.778 --> 12:36.577
How did you get into Psylocke?

12:36.612 --> 12:39.649
I watched the X-Men TV
show in the early '90s,

12:39.683 --> 12:41.783
saw those, like, strong female characters,

12:41.817 --> 12:43.583
and I was just like, "this is awesome."

12:43.618 --> 12:45.184
She's just amazing.

12:45.218 --> 12:47.015
Is she your all-time favorite?

12:47.049 --> 12:49.085
Yes. She's really cool.

12:49.119 --> 12:50.654
Yeah, well, I'm glad that you like it,

12:50.688 --> 12:52.289
because she's my favorite.

12:52.324 --> 12:54.425
Ashley and the customer, real quick,

12:54.460 --> 12:56.128
I see they start to make a connection

12:56.162 --> 12:57.864
over the character Psylocke.

12:57.898 --> 12:59.900
I was kind of surprised.

12:59.934 --> 13:02.899
I mean, usually you don't see
that that often, that quickly.

13:02.934 --> 13:05.101
I think in most retail establishments,

13:05.136 --> 13:07.536
quick friendships are
usually made at the counter,

13:07.571 --> 13:08.870
'cause people are like, "hey, how are you?

13:08.904 --> 13:10.769
How are you? Have a nice day."

13:10.804 --> 13:14.205
But you're like, "these two are
actually talking to each other

13:14.239 --> 13:16.040
"like there's mutual affection.

13:16.074 --> 13:18.074
What species is this?"

13:18.109 --> 13:20.810
I've Cosplayed as Psylocke before...

13:20.844 --> 13:22.444
- You have?
- And have a purple wig.

13:22.479 --> 13:24.280
And people always come up
to me, and they're like,

13:24.315 --> 13:25.716
"oh, my God, is that your real hair?"

13:25.750 --> 13:27.318
And I'm like, "yeah!"

13:27.352 --> 13:29.321
Do you do, like, full
butt out and everything?

13:29.355 --> 13:32.795
No, it's a little bit
more covered in the back.

13:32.829 --> 13:34.628
I don't have enough guts
to, like, wear a thong

13:34.663 --> 13:36.397
around the costume floor.

13:36.431 --> 13:38.201
I wouldn't either. I
don't even have the guts

13:38.235 --> 13:40.204
to wear a thong in my own
apartment when I'm alone.

13:40.239 --> 13:42.506
I'm like, "okay." Are you having fun, Walt?

13:42.540 --> 13:44.141
- Yes, yes.
- This is interesting.

13:44.175 --> 13:45.711
- Are you learning a lot?
- Sorry.

13:45.746 --> 13:48.950
We're having a moment
right now. Leave us alone.

13:48.984 --> 13:50.953
I don't want to say
that it was uncomfortable.

13:50.988 --> 13:53.124
I just felt like there was a little bit

13:53.158 --> 13:54.727
of an age difference, you know?

13:54.761 --> 13:56.127
I felt like the creepy old man,

13:56.162 --> 13:57.797
like, listening to these two young girls.

13:57.831 --> 14:00.632
"They're talking about butt-floss, Bry!"

14:00.667 --> 14:02.998
"They are? They are?"

14:03.032 --> 14:06.232
All right, sounds
like you're interested.

14:06.267 --> 14:09.538
Yes. Yeah, a little bit.

14:09.573 --> 14:11.711
Yes, this really awesome.

14:11.746 --> 14:13.745
I'm looking to get $125 for it today.

14:13.779 --> 14:16.549
$125...

14:16.584 --> 14:19.021
Would you go $85?

14:19.055 --> 14:20.688
No, I couldn't do $85.

14:20.721 --> 14:22.687
No, it is the San Diego con exclusive.

14:22.722 --> 14:24.890
You're not gonna walk into
every store and see it.

14:24.925 --> 14:28.195
Best offer I can do, 100 bucks,

14:28.230 --> 14:29.597
and that is it.

14:29.631 --> 14:31.231
I cannot go any lower than that.

14:31.265 --> 14:32.698
Oh, man.

14:35.402 --> 14:38.603
Yeah, I think I'd stick at, like, $85,

14:38.638 --> 14:42.039
'cause I can probably find it online.

14:42.073 --> 14:44.243

you showing it to me.

- All right.

- I understand.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:49.883 --> 14:52.518
Umm, you have to get this
right now. Think about it.

If you want to spend $85...
shipping and handling,

14:55.388 --> 14:57.458
that's gonna cost, what? 25 bucks?

14:57.492 --> 14:59.094
That's true.

14:59.129 --> 15:01.194
You probably won't
get it for a few weeks.

15:01.229 --> 15:03.195
You can walk out of
here right now with this.

15:03.229 --> 15:05.199
Oh, man.

15:05.233 --> 15:07.433
You make a good point with the shipping.

15:07.467 --> 15:11.271

$85 plus shipping and handling,

15:11.306 --> 15:14.271
you might as well walk out
of here right now with this.

- All right.

Do you think having a
feminine touch behind the counter

15:35.140 --> 15:37.272
helped in this negotiation?

15:37.307 --> 15:40.477
That really was something that
I didn't even realize we needed.

15:40.511 --> 15:44.344
I mean, it was getting stuffy in there.

15:44.379 --> 15:46.414

we were all in thongs.

something to look forward

Nobody's looking for you either.

What about you, Bry?

For me, whatever has
the most supple pages,

16:32.935 --> 16:36.469
so that when I roll it into
a cylindrical form, just...

16:36.503 --> 16:39.140
I'll pack a little bit of seaweed in there,

16:39.175 --> 16:40.808

16:40.843 --> 16:42.643

are you implying here?

17:08.400 --> 17:10.800
Awesome. Can we open
it up, take a look at it?

17:10.836 --> 17:13.202
- Please do, check it out, man.
- Oh, look at this.

17:13.236 --> 17:15.171
Oh, my goodness. It's awesome, though.

17:15.238 --> 17:17.474
It's gorgeous. It's never
been taken out of the box, huh?

17:17.509 --> 17:19.578
- Nope, nope.
- It's easily one

17:19.612 --> 17:22.546
of the best replicas I've
ever seen of the '66 Batman belt.

17:22.580 --> 17:24.079
- Where'd you get it?
- Online.

17:24.115 --> 17:25.280
Wasn't really what I was expecting.

17:25.314 --> 17:26.714
- But...
- Why?

17:26.748 --> 17:28.618
I thought it was gonna be more like

17:28.652 --> 17:30.254
<i>Frank Miller's dark knight
rather than '66 Batman.</i>

17:30.289 --> 17:31.657
Got to be honest with you.

17:31.692 --> 17:33.092
Frank Miller's one was very yellow.

17:33.126 --> 17:34.893
I mean, what on earth do you see on this

17:34.927 --> 17:36.928
that you're like, "eh,
I don't want it anymore"?

17:36.962 --> 17:38.661
It just reeks of Adam west to me.

17:38.696 --> 17:40.293
Not an Adam west fan?

17:40.327 --> 17:41.927
No, it was a little too campy for me.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.765
Me too. Christian Bale... he's a hunk.

17:44.800 --> 17:49.635
Batman... Adam West
is hunky too, though.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.003
She's crapping on the bat!

17:51.037 --> 17:52.971
How dare she!

17:53.005 --> 17:54.639
You know, she loves Batman, she says,

17:54.673 --> 17:56.240
but not that version of Batman.

17:56.274 --> 17:58.708
You can't exclude any version of Batman,

17:58.742 --> 18:00.443
particularly Batman '66.

18:00.477 --> 18:02.444
<i>The old Batman TV show
was the first introduction</i>

18:02.478 --> 18:04.279
of that character to the mainstream.

18:04.312 --> 18:06.715
Without that, you don't get
to those Chris nolan movies,

18:06.750 --> 18:09.422
to the Tim Burton movies,
so you got to respect that.

18:09.457 --> 18:11.857
Sounds like you really
want to unload it. How come?

18:11.892 --> 18:13.695
The 75th anniversary coming around...

18:13.729 --> 18:15.129
you got a lot of cool stuff coming out

18:15.163 --> 18:16.929
that's more my taste, I think, so...

18:16.964 --> 18:18.931
All right, I'm definitely
interested, you know,

18:18.965 --> 18:20.199
if the price is right.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.632
How much you looking to get for it?

18:21.667 --> 18:23.168
I need to get $300 for it.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.871
$300.

18:24.906 --> 18:27.273
All right, dude, so
honestly, just, like...

18:27.307 --> 18:29.208
300 bucks, man? That's not gonna happen.

18:29.242 --> 18:32.416
That's, like, way too much.

18:32.450 --> 18:35.322
- What do you think?
- This is what you're gonna do.

18:35.357 --> 18:38.929
You're gonna sell me this for $175,

18:38.963 --> 18:43.568
and we're all gonna walk out happy.

18:43.603 --> 18:45.070
Yikes.

18:45.105 --> 18:46.304
Uh...

18:50.312 --> 18:51.278
Um.

18:51.313 --> 18:52.479
$175. Deal.

18:52.513 --> 18:54.382
Sounds good, man.

18:56.919 --> 18:58.521
- There you go.
- Thank you.

18:58.556 --> 19:00.394
- Thank you. We appreciate it.
- All right, guys.

19:00.428 --> 19:01.864
- I'll see you later.
- Have a great day.

19:01.898 --> 19:03.499
Wow. What just happened there?

19:03.533 --> 19:05.501
What? That was easy.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.340
- That was easy.
- This could be a whole new era

19:07.374 --> 19:09.009
of negotiation for the stash, man.

19:09.043 --> 19:10.511
Yeah, like, let's get
some more people in here.

19:10.545 --> 19:12.046
That's fun.

19:12.081 --> 19:13.715
Sounds like what you had on your hands

19:13.750 --> 19:16.017
was a case of feminine mystique.

19:16.051 --> 19:17.819
Like, a girl jedi mind-tricks you

19:17.853 --> 19:19.654
with, like, "this is what's gonna happen."

19:19.689 --> 19:21.056
But, you know, you're
like, "all right, yeah.

19:21.090 --> 19:22.992
That sounds like a plan."

19:23.026 --> 19:24.761
[Laughter]

19:24.795 --> 19:26.762
Ashley, could you come
back here for a second?

19:26.797 --> 19:28.097
We need to talk to you.

19:28.132 --> 19:30.936
- Am I in trouble?
- Not at all.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.571
Oh, good. What's up?

19:32.605 --> 19:35.006
The Secret Stash is
kind of like the Avengers.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.241
I would be Iron Man.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.346
I have my Captain America in Mike.

19:38.380 --> 19:41.548
I have my Thor in
Bry, my Jarvis...

19:41.583 --> 19:43.885
I don't know.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.555
But I don't have a black widow.

19:45.589 --> 19:48.124
I'd like to offer you a roster spot

19:48.158 --> 19:50.259
at the Secret Stash.

19:50.294 --> 19:51.695
[Clears throat]

19:51.729 --> 19:53.566
I don't even know what to say.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.960
My assistant? At the stash?

19:55.140 --> 19:56.402
I figured you can get another assistant.

19:56.402 --> 19:58.379
There are probably hundreds of
'em out there in L.A., right?

19:58.379 --> 20:00.083
Yeah, but, I mean, like,
who's gonna pick me up

20:00.083 --> 20:01.752
and drive me pla...
who's gonna get my weed?

20:01.752 --> 20:04.441
[Laughter]

20:04.475 --> 20:06.073
I'm so flattered.

20:06.108 --> 20:08.107
I can still be your black widow,

20:08.141 --> 20:12.610
but I just don't know if I
could work here full-time.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.414
Wait a minute. So are you saying no?

20:14.449 --> 20:16.484
- No hard feelings, Walt.
- No, no, not at all.

20:16.518 --> 20:17.918
- No hard feelings.
- I love you.

20:17.952 --> 20:20.857
We're buddies. We're here.

20:20.891 --> 20:22.460
It's an excellent job for us.

20:22.495 --> 20:24.129
We've been lucky enough to craft a world

20:24.163 --> 20:26.098
where we get to have the job that we dig.

20:26.132 --> 20:27.867
But for her?

20:27.901 --> 20:30.237
<i>The idea of sitting
around, talking about Batman</i>

20:30.271 --> 20:33.207
and all this stuff,
and what if Walt and Bry

20:33.241 --> 20:35.911
kissed in the negative zone or something?

20:35.945 --> 20:37.480
If we kissed in the negative zone,

20:37.514 --> 20:38.948
it would shatter cosmos.

20:38.982 --> 20:42.018
[Laughter]

20:42.052 --> 20:43.520
Oh, and just like sands

20:43.554 --> 20:45.519
through the hourglass of our man,

20:45.554 --> 20:47.086
<i>these have been the days of our lives.</i>

20:47.121 --> 20:48.987
<i>For Comic Book Men, I'm Kevin Smith.</i>

20:49.021 --> 20:50.652
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:50.687 --> 20:52.054
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:52.088 --> 20:53.688
Everything is awesome, kids.

20:53.722 --> 20:56.207
Everything is cool when
you're part of a team.

20:56.207 --> 20:57.040
Good night.

20:57.725 --> 21:00.077
