WEBVTT

00:04.754 --> 00:06.548
This season, for me,
it’s a new place,

00:06.589 --> 00:08.341
a new boat, with
new department heads.

00:08.383 --> 00:09.342
Welcome.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.720
Oh, my gosh, hello,
how are you?

00:11.761 --> 00:16.307
As a chief stew, I’m definitely
a lead by example kind of girl.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.684
That sounds super cringe.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.729
-I’m Tasha.
-Natalya, nice to meet you.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.440
Is this, like, my sister,
is this my twin, like...

00:23.481 --> 00:26.151
We’re like twins, almost, yeah.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.030
-Hi, I’m Raygan!
-Welcome aboard.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.990
These are your deck crew.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.366
We gotta turn this boat around.

00:33.408 --> 00:36.286
Malia’s shoes will
be hard to fill.

00:40.623 --> 00:41.958
[yawns]

00:42.000 --> 00:43.626
-Home, sweet, home.
-Ah!

00:43.668 --> 00:44.794
Oh what the [bleep]!

00:44.836 --> 00:47.380
I just did a month
charter with Natasha.

00:49.924 --> 00:52.093
Yeah.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.386
Dave, did you
choose your cabin?

00:53.428 --> 00:54.471
You wanna share with...

00:54.512 --> 00:55.764
I don’t care who I share with.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.766
I’ve just been
through a break-up,

00:57.807 --> 00:59.392
and I don’t
like being single.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.311
Go in the forward cabin,
then, if you want.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.771
We’re roomies?

01:04.773 --> 01:06.441
I’m a service queen
from the get-go.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.860
I don’t think
there’s any need for a rank.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.403
I feel that I do
deserve my rank.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.697
We can be joint second.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.912
[bleep]

01:18.953 --> 01:19.996
-Hi, everyone.
-Welcome!

01:20.038 --> 01:21.247
Hello.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.499
Billy and Chris will
be celebrating

01:22.540 --> 01:23.583
their anniversary
during their stay.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.918
There’s one suitcase left.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.419
I can’t carry that,
it’s too heavy.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.712
I’m getting
irritated with Raygan.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.963
I feel like
I’m pulling more weight.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.298
Oh, my ----ing God.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.092
There’s nothing in the water.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.968
-Who’s the bosun?
-Raygan!

01:34.010 --> 01:35.261
I am really sorry.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.222
We left the dock
without two crew members,

01:37.263 --> 01:39.349
so the deck team is
really struggling.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.517
So then, like, make up for it.

01:40.558 --> 01:42.769
I’ll take care of it.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.104
-It’s so good to meet you.
-Storm, welcome.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.647
Hello, Captain Sandy!

01:45.689 --> 01:47.482
Myself and Storm,
we’ve been childhood friends.

01:47.524 --> 01:51.319
That same moustache he has
today he’s had since he was 13.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.321
-Storm, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, yeah.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.656
Storm is super fit.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.450
Mm.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.494
Tender, WaveRunners,
in the water.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.037
Okay.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.706
Ah!

02:02.747 --> 02:04.124
I’m gonna fall.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.709
All crew, all crew,
we have some

02:05.750 --> 02:08.962
malfunctioning of
our stabilizers... hang on.

02:09.004 --> 02:10.588
Hold everything, hold... oh!

02:11.464 --> 02:13.091
The boat’s rocking.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.884
Are we crashing?

02:14.926 --> 02:16.011
What’s happening?

02:16.052 --> 02:17.470
----ing hell!

02:21.599 --> 02:23.309
[shrieking]

02:23.351 --> 02:24.894
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.896
Where’s the stabilizers?

02:33.069 --> 02:34.863
We just lost our stabilizers.

02:38.575 --> 02:39.993
No!

02:40.035 --> 02:41.661
All crew, all crew, hang on.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.121
No! Hold everything!
Hold everything!

02:43.163 --> 02:46.082
-All crew, all crew, hang on.
-Oh!

02:46.124 --> 02:47.542
Ah!

02:48.460 --> 02:50.920
Where are the lifejackets?

02:50.962 --> 02:52.213
No, no, no!

02:52.255 --> 02:53.340
Oh sh--.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.967
Gosh, we’re really tipping.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.680
Stabilizers are fins
that stop the boat

03:00.722 --> 03:02.474
from moving from side-to-side.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.185
Losing stabilizers
is very dangerous.

03:05.226 --> 03:08.355
The crew could get hurt,
a guest could fall over

03:08.396 --> 03:10.732
and bop their head,
anything could happen.

03:13.109 --> 03:14.069
Oh, God.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.528
You all right?

03:25.914 --> 03:29.876
Oh my ----ing word.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.753
Can we use our stabilizers?

03:38.677 --> 03:40.679
Well, we’re in a real pickle,
aren’t we?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.305
Yeah.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.725
-Natalya!
-Yeah?

03:45.767 --> 03:48.728
Get up here quickly,
we need you ASAP.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.398
Bring a vacuum cleaner
with a hard head.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.778
There’s glass all over the
sky lounge upstairs,

03:56.820 --> 03:58.863
bottles have all fallen
off the bar and smashed.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.448
Okay, I’m gonna
run upstairs, then?

04:00.490 --> 04:04.244
-Go ahead.
-Gotcha.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.621
Oh, my God.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.290
Wow, this is crazy,
that was bonkers.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.295
This is a ----ing mess.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.924
-These are the generators.
-Mm-hmm.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.301
So, we lost that one.

04:20.343 --> 04:24.764
But that’s not automatic,
you had to manually connect it?

04:24.806 --> 04:25.849
Yeah.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.977
-I mean, I...
-So, we had a glitch...

04:29.019 --> 04:30.270
Ah.

04:30.311 --> 04:32.230
I heard glass smashing
everywhere, bro.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.273
Brü, it was chaotic up there.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.315
Should we drop that NautiBuoy?

04:34.357 --> 04:35.608
Yeah, yeah, that’s cool.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.444
-There she is.
-I’m going on vacation.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.945
-Ah!
-[laughing]

04:38.987 --> 04:40.447
I’m waiting for someone
to tell me what happened.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.283
-This boat is a hybrid.
-Yeah.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.951
One cooling system
for everything.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.954
When the cooling system
starts to heat up,

04:47.996 --> 04:50.457
it systematically
starts shutting units down,

04:50.498 --> 04:52.500
which shuts down our
stabilizers.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.252
And thankfully, no one got hurt.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.545
Again, I’m really sorry.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.422
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.424
You all right, Tash?

05:00.967 --> 05:03.386
This is a joke.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.014
Raygan, toys, WaveRunners,
in the water.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.224
-There you go.
-Yeah.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.225
Okay, thank you.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.643
It’s like ----ed up.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.479
I’ve been on a boat
that fell on its side,

05:12.520 --> 05:14.481
so I’ve got, like,
quite bad PTSD,

05:14.522 --> 05:15.940
so this is really
screwing with me right now.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.569
In 2019 I was on
a 90-meter yacht,

05:19.611 --> 05:21.696
and the boat
tipped on its side.

05:21.738 --> 05:25.992
I just remember crying, thinking
this is it, I’m gonna die.

05:26.034 --> 05:30.246
I called to start taking
names of the crew lists,

05:30.288 --> 05:32.624
and people weren’t answering.

05:32.665 --> 05:36.836
There were electrical smells,
fuel spilling everywhere.

05:36.878 --> 05:40.924
I couldn’t even get
out of the door; I tried.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.137
We were really
lucky that nobody died.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.933
I’m a person in general to put
on a brave face, you carry on.

05:49.974 --> 05:53.353
You have no other choice,
otherwise, you’re gonna fail.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.854
This is ----ing crazy.

05:54.896 --> 05:58.316
This is ridiculous.
Owff!

05:58.358 --> 05:59.693
Sh--.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.152
I haven’t eaten,
and I’m just, like...

06:01.194 --> 06:02.696
Yeah, I’ve not...
I’m not even fazed.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.571
Right.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.198
I just want to heave some water.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.366
There’s just so much to do,
like, it’s just too...

06:06.408 --> 06:07.659
Yeah.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.035
...much to kinda think
about eating.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.453
I heard you guys had a
bit of a tumble earlier,

06:10.495 --> 06:12.330
-I heard it from the tender.
-Yeah.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.874
Sounded like Armageddon
earlier on.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.544
Did you hurt yourself?

06:17.585 --> 06:19.045
I’m all right,
it’ll be all right.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.463
-I’m sorry about that.
-That’s all right.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.548
-It’s terrible.
-It is what it is.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.841
Are you okay?

06:22.882 --> 06:25.093
Oh, God, just got a few cuts
and stuff,

06:25.135 --> 06:27.303
just from cleaning glass up,
but we’re all good.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.680
-Ah.
-I’m sorry.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.099
Never experienced that before,
that was gnarly.

06:31.141 --> 06:34.394
I had a boiling pan of water
that went into the fryer,

06:34.436 --> 06:36.146
and I had to try and catch it.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.564
I was prepping for dinner,

06:37.605 --> 06:41.234
but now all my food’s
all over the place.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.527
I have so much to do.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.112
This is a nightmare.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.907
I’ll just work as quick as
I can and do what I can.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.410
One of us wash, one of us dry,
one of us put away.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.787
Let’s get the big stuff in
first..

06:52.829 --> 06:55.081
Well, we need to put our
banisters in, quickly.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.167
-Okay.
-I’m in.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.718
Okay, guys, listen, we’ve
gotta put toys in the water.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.016
Do you want me to
go housekeeping

07:13.058 --> 07:14.142
you can serve or just...

07:14.184 --> 07:15.352
Can you kinda jump
into cabins for now?

07:15.393 --> 07:16.936
Yeah, yeah, no worries.

07:16.978 --> 07:21.399
I’m just living sex fantasies
with a Walmart reality.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.859
Ooh.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.112
It’s going.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.660
It’s okay, I wanna listen.

07:32.702 --> 07:33.953
I wanna know
what’s going on in...

07:38.166 --> 07:40.835
Yeah...noodle.

07:40.877 --> 07:41.878
No.

07:43.338 --> 07:47.175
I was with my ex in a very
long-term relationship for,

07:47.217 --> 07:48.635
like, four and a half years.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.470
So, now I’m single.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.514
I can flirt with
people if I want to.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.101
There’s not too much difference,

07:56.142 --> 07:59.062
if I’m honest, of me flirting
or just being myself.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.317
It’s actually just me.

08:04.359 --> 08:07.904
I am just that warm,
bubbly, bright person.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.701
[sighs]

08:18.289 --> 08:19.249
We can make you one.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.669
Should we just do a left
toward starboard?

08:22.711 --> 08:23.837
-Okay.
-Over.

08:23.878 --> 08:27.173
I need infused cucumber vodka.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.677
Thank you so much.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.387
Sorry, I’m getting to
the cabins straightaway.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.805
Oh, no, no, I don’t think
anyone’s worried about it,

08:33.847 --> 08:37.392
-thank you so much.
-Thank you.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.686
I have never been
passionate with anything to do

08:39.728 --> 08:41.104
like, I’ve never been,

08:41.146 --> 08:42.939
like, I wanna be a doctor,
I wanna be a vet.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.066
People are passionate about
saving lives and being doctors.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.860
I don’t know how people
don’t enjoy cleaning.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.153
It’s very relaxing.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.156
I’m very passionate
about cleaning.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.074
Sweaty sweaty.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.873
There you go.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.750
Okay, let’s make this a
strong one, actually...

09:01.791 --> 09:03.585
very strong.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.214
Yeah, yeah, you’re going away,
you’re going away.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.632
Oh, no.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.926
Don’t go anywhere.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.346
Chuck it, chuck it.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.391
Nope.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.601
I wanna see how this is.

09:19.642 --> 09:20.977
Vodka-cucumber-seltzer.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.313
Fantastic.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.941
Nope.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.568
Yeah, we’re just ready to
be in the water now.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.904
Someone rescue him!

09:30.945 --> 09:33.281
Really, really
----ing frustrating.

09:33.323 --> 09:34.949
This is so embarrassing.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.413
-Help him!
-Oh, no.

09:56.805 --> 09:57.305
Storm, don’t go!

09:59.015 --> 10:00.475
Someone rescue him!

10:00.517 --> 10:02.727
Jason, can you jump in there
and get him, please?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.562
Yeah.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.315
-Oh, what was that?
-Oh!

10:07.357 --> 10:10.318
It seems like a malfunction
and a delay in our enjoyment.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.820
A Raygan situation

10:11.861 --> 10:13.655
She’s winning all of the awards.

10:13.697 --> 10:16.491
Okay, pull in, let’s go.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.992
Thanks, buddy.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.454
There’s gotta be a more
convenient way to do that.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.082
What’s that?

10:25.625 --> 10:28.336
Usually, what we would have done
is before putting that out,

10:28.378 --> 10:30.213
put this in the middle
of those two

10:30.255 --> 10:32.257
and then push them
off in one go.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.845
Yay!

10:41.016 --> 10:43.268
Got out of bed at
like, 5:00, 5:00-ish.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.352
Did you?

10:44.394 --> 10:46.396
You’re, like,
the quietest roomie.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.163
Mm-hmm.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.879
Come on!

11:10.920 --> 11:12.630
I’ve got some gifts for you.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.715
-Yes?
-I wish it was a...

11:13.757 --> 11:14.883
-Is it just one?
-...nicer gift.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.593
-Is it many?
-It’s several.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.261
Several.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.137
Oop!

11:19.179 --> 11:20.430
Are you guys done talking sh--

11:20.472 --> 11:22.057
while the rest of us
work our asses off?

11:22.098 --> 11:23.933
We’re actually flirting
without you, sorry.

11:23.975 --> 11:25.226
Okay, are you flirting?

11:25.268 --> 11:26.728
Yeah, why did you have
to gate-crash?

11:26.770 --> 11:27.896
Why the hell?

11:27.937 --> 11:29.272
You could have come
in quite nicely,

11:29.314 --> 11:30.482
it would have joined
you into the trifecta.

11:31.566 --> 11:32.609
Maybe!

11:32.650 --> 11:34.486
-Can I be in the middle?
-Rawr!

11:36.738 --> 11:38.990
Ah!

11:39.032 --> 11:42.285
I’m one-handed.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.079
Grab it!

11:44.120 --> 11:46.581
You guys gotta organize
your lockers and stuff.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.458
Yeah.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.919
Because when we get our
slide and our pool,

11:50.960 --> 11:52.420
we have to have
a place to put it.

11:54.631 --> 11:55.924
I’ll have to go look, but I...

11:55.965 --> 11:56.925
Okay, I’m gonna come
look with you.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.134
Thought there was more.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.135
Okay.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.178
You go.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.429
Oh, my God,
you got tons of stuff.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.057
Here.
I wanna be a floating resort.

12:04.099 --> 12:06.309
-Gonna put that one up?
-Yeah.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.813
Let’s get these toys
blown up really fast.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.981
Natalya, Natalya, Tasha.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.407
The master will be finished
in one minute.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.284
My management style,
I’m very trusting.

12:23.326 --> 12:26.454
I will try and go back where
I can and check things,

12:26.496 --> 12:29.207
but luckily, I’ve got
such a great team

12:29.249 --> 12:32.168
that I trust them 110 percent.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.007
Sorry, I have to wash it.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.761
How’s it going so far?

12:41.803 --> 12:43.972
Yeah, I think once we get
familiar with everything,

12:44.014 --> 12:45.557
that things will be
a lot better.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.976
Mm-hmm, I haven’t been able
to organize something.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.395
Like, on who wants
what hours and what hours.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.313
Like, Storm,
he was supposed to rest.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.773
Yeah.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.316
And you’re supposed to be
resting right now, but...

12:55.358 --> 12:57.652
No, it’s...
that’s fine.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.363
I don’t know what Raygan’s style
of management is, actually.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.992
Guys, if you’re ever
setting up the swim platform,

13:04.034 --> 13:05.285
this is what I like.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.703
All right, let’s throw
this bad boy.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.663
David, Malia,
let’s get the jet-skis off

13:08.705 --> 13:09.664
the sled right away.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.291
Copy.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.834
It just doesn’t seem
like there’s much direction

13:12.876 --> 13:14.127
or structure.
But at the same time,

13:14.169 --> 13:16.254
I don’t wanna question
and, like,

13:16.296 --> 13:19.382
step on her toes,
because she’s the bosun.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.343
I’m gonna go and
write down a schedule

13:21.384 --> 13:22.927
and stuff like that and
arrange things now.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.679
-I’ll be back in a bit.
-All right.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.014
Yeah.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.685
Chef, are we doing plated
tonight, or family-style?

13:30.727 --> 13:33.605
-Well, the sushi will be...
-Oh, we’re doing sushi.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.689
Okay, never mind.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.358
-Whoa.
-Ooh.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.443
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

13:43.406 --> 13:46.034
...know who’s capable
of doing what.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.619
Okay, so, where’s your schedule?

13:47.660 --> 13:48.995
-Hm?
-For people’s...

13:49.037 --> 13:52.290
like, what...
I need that, they need that.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.637
I’m not able to plan
my obviously schedule

14:05.679 --> 14:07.514
because I don’t know
who’s capable of what.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.267
Hello.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.727
So, where are you guys
off to after this?

14:12.769 --> 14:14.729
-Greece.
-Greece.

14:14.771 --> 14:15.897
Oh, it’s so tough.

14:15.939 --> 14:16.981
I’m so sorry you
have to do this.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.608
Yeah.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.443
I thought, you know what, let
me go to Venice after this.

14:20.485 --> 14:21.903
I’m still searching
for love in

14:21.945 --> 14:22.904
between all of
this nonsense, yeah.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.239
Aw.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.699
How long ago was this
when you guys met?

14:25.740 --> 14:27.117
-Seven years ago.
-Seven years, okay, got you.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.410
I really wanna wait for that.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.788
I’ve only had
a 12-year relationship.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.373
He left me for a woman.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.250
We started in high school,
he asked me out in high school.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.751
Wait, we need to unpack this.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.044
-Yeah.
-How long ago was this?

14:38.086 --> 14:39.587
-Oh, Leslie.
-This is crazy!

14:39.629 --> 14:41.214
It was two years ago,
because I came out last year.

14:41.256 --> 14:42.841
-Oh.
-Oh!

14:42.882 --> 14:44.259
-Girl, can we get some...
-Wait.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.468
Thank you, thank you.

14:45.510 --> 14:49.014
-Yay!
-Woo!

14:50.473 --> 14:53.268
It’s my first time
getting guests which

14:53.309 --> 14:56.021
are part of the LGBTQIA+
community, such as myself,

14:56.062 --> 15:00.525
and having also the chance
to celebrate the anniversary,

15:00.567 --> 15:02.277
something that’s also so dear
to me,

15:02.318 --> 15:05.238
is finding true love,
like it was meant to be.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.115
I’m honestly
so happy for you two.

15:07.157 --> 15:12.662
Very jealous, but happy.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.581
Jason, hook the jet-ski up

15:14.622 --> 15:17.042
and then come to the bridge
deck as quick as possible.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.711
You’re gonna help
me place it, easy-peasy.

15:19.753 --> 15:20.754
Cool.

15:20.795 --> 15:23.590
He’s impressive.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.175
Sandy, Sandy, Raygan.

15:25.216 --> 15:28.970
Can you please
meet up in the crew mess?

15:29.012 --> 15:30.638
Ah, this is so nice.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.349
It’s beautiful.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.065
Okay.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.399
That’s great.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.154
That’s awesome.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.280
Thank you.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.490
I’ll be back now for that one.

15:48.531 --> 15:51.951
Yep, yeah.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.495
-Guys.
-Yeah?

15:53.536 --> 15:54.996
You fancy bringing
this up with me?

15:55.038 --> 15:56.498
Okay, let’s go, babe.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.251
It’s so quiet now.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.171
Maybe on the arm of the sofa.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.298
There’s loads of happy
anniversary stuff as well.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.299
Ooh!

16:06.341 --> 16:08.301
This is what we
are talking about.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.178
-Love?
-Oh, my God.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.138
Can I please use
this after the set-up?

16:12.180 --> 16:13.848
-[laughing]
-Pink penis.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.558
It’s gonna be a good
party-starter, trust me.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.268
-Big, pink penis.
-You know what I’m gonna do?

16:17.310 --> 16:18.561
I’m gonna walk out like
this for service tonight.

16:18.603 --> 16:19.562
Oh!

16:19.604 --> 16:22.023
Come on.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.067
I’m only joking...
this is what I’m gonna do.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.652
Hold there.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.070
Oh...

16:28.196 --> 16:29.698
Your mum’s gonna be proud, guys.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.574
Should I just ask the guests
if they want some drinks?

16:31.616 --> 16:33.827
I just think that the gays
are gonna appreciate it,

16:33.868 --> 16:36.663
and I want these guests
to leave with a memory.

16:36.705 --> 16:40.041
-Let’s go.
-I need to watch.

16:40.083 --> 16:44.671
A long, veiny, girthy,

16:44.713 --> 16:47.048
pink, vibrating memory.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.925
Did you guys want
something else to drink?

16:48.967 --> 16:51.761
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God!

16:51.803 --> 16:53.221
Do you need something to drink?

16:53.263 --> 16:54.931
You guys are good.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.850
Everyone around...

16:56.891 --> 16:59.728
Can you point to Malta, please?

16:59.769 --> 17:02.689
Where’s due north?

17:02.731 --> 17:04.983
That was amazing.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.234
Or that big.

17:06.276 --> 17:07.402
-Yeah!
-Ah!

17:09.946 --> 17:11.656
What time do I go on?

17:11.698 --> 17:13.116
How do I read this?

17:14.743 --> 17:18.705
Okay.

17:18.747 --> 17:20.165
Okay, and then...

17:22.083 --> 17:23.585
-Okay.
-Okay?

17:23.626 --> 17:26.463
Raygan’s schedule kinda
just looks like a math problem

17:26.504 --> 17:28.256
that just doesn’t
have a solution.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.508
Is that 1:00 am to 2:00 a.m.?

17:30.550 --> 17:31.843
Oh, that’s tomorrow.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.970
I was in commodity trading
for 11 years,

17:34.012 --> 17:38.391
so I’ve done a lot of equations
and formulas and spreadsheets,

17:38.433 --> 17:41.061
and I don’t think there’s
an algorithm

17:41.102 --> 17:44.647
that would be able to solve this
puzzle that she’s constructed.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.033
Coming up...

17:55.075 --> 17:56.993
-Okay, here.
-Okay, put this on.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.828
-Good night, all.
-Good night.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.956
-Welcome home.
-Oh, my God!

18:11.675 --> 18:12.258
One, two, three, jump!

18:15.553 --> 18:16.721
Woo!

18:21.726 --> 18:23.395
I’m not doing that,
are you crazy?

18:27.732 --> 18:30.068
So messed up!

18:30.110 --> 18:31.486
Ah, the guests are calling.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.029
Actually, do you wanna
get this one first?

18:33.071 --> 18:35.740
Tell them I’m on my way
with the espresso martinis.

18:35.782 --> 18:39.077
Raygan, Raygan, are we able
to have just one deck crew?

18:39.119 --> 18:40.620
Okay, you can go now.

18:40.662 --> 18:41.746
Thank you.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.415
Thank you so much
for all your help.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.459
-Espresso martini.
-Thank you so much.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.003
You’re welcome.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.423
-Okay.
-Hello...

18:51.464 --> 18:54.718
So, if you wanna start setting
up those lanterns...

18:54.759 --> 18:55.635
Yeah, mm-hmm.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.387
That’s gonna go behind you.

18:57.429 --> 18:58.888
What is the party?

18:58.930 --> 19:00.515
It’s their anniversary.

19:00.557 --> 19:03.226
We’re making it super romantic,
and they want a Japanese night.

19:03.268 --> 19:06.813
Can you jump in,
get the lever out, yeah?

19:06.855 --> 19:08.064
Why am I jumping in?

19:08.106 --> 19:09.691
Jump on the dock, not in.

19:09.733 --> 19:10.900
-Well...
-On the dock.

19:10.942 --> 19:11.985
Why?

19:12.027 --> 19:13.278
Because you’re wearing
this, and...

19:13.319 --> 19:14.738
No, no, no, but what’s the...

19:14.779 --> 19:16.072
before we do it, can we
talk through the process?

19:16.114 --> 19:17.407
Because you need to
bring the anchors in.

19:17.449 --> 19:18.408
Because today...
there’s anchors?

19:18.450 --> 19:19.576
Yeah, these bags.

19:19.617 --> 19:20.910
So, are they just,
like, hooked on?

19:20.952 --> 19:22.579
-Yeah, hold on.
-No, no, no, I’ll do it.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.205
I’m definitely missing some
of the aspects of

19:24.247 --> 19:26.332
skipping my own boat, being
the captain and being in charge.

19:26.374 --> 19:30.170
It’s frustrating, because
I’m a very strong type A.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.796
I just want somebody to manage.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.382
I would love to, I’m used to it,

19:34.424 --> 19:36.051
but with my position being

19:36.092 --> 19:37.927
the low man on
the totem pole, I can’t.

19:37.969 --> 19:42.599
So literally, you just pull it,
and then stick it down.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.684
-That’s it?
-Yeah.

19:48.313 --> 19:50.023
[bleep]
Sneak.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.484
Are you going?

19:54.027 --> 19:55.195
Okay.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.822
The sushi is so time-consuming.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.240
So, what’s the plan tonight?

19:59.282 --> 20:01.159
I honestly don’t know.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.204
That’s fine, you are amazing.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.373
Today is the day I was meant
to be making up for yesterday.

20:06.414 --> 20:09.501
He’s just asking do we have any
other beef without cinnamon in.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.211
It’s a little more rare.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.629
It’s just Billy.

20:12.671 --> 20:13.630
He’s just asking if
we can go a tiny bit

20:13.672 --> 20:14.798
more on the medium side.

20:32.399 --> 20:35.193
Sashimi.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.528
Tonight’s the night.

20:36.569 --> 20:37.987
Tonight’s the party night.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.989
Chris, so, how many brothers
and sisters do you have?

20:40.031 --> 20:41.825
We have 12, but me and Billy
are the only ones

20:41.866 --> 20:43.993
that share the same mother
and father, unfortunately.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.161
Oh.

20:45.203 --> 20:46.663
Okay, let’s pull it up.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.957
Should we go and eat
and get changed?

20:48.998 --> 20:50.417
Yeah.

20:50.458 --> 20:53.545
Natalya, Kyle, Tasha,
do you wanna start

20:53.586 --> 20:56.339
rotating out for dinner and
getting into your blacks?

20:56.381 --> 20:57.549
Copy.

21:05.557 --> 21:09.019
Can I take some ginger
for the condiment tray?

21:09.060 --> 21:10.186
That one, there.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.187
Are we gonna put bets on this?

21:11.229 --> 21:12.689
Yep.

21:12.731 --> 21:16.693
If it’s not here, you owe
me a bottle of tequila.

21:16.735 --> 21:18.069
Okay.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.571
What do you want it if is here?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.531
Nah, I can’t say it.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.575
Oh, my God!

21:23.616 --> 21:25.160
Is this what I think it is?

21:25.201 --> 21:27.871
I told you it was there.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.330
Go on, then,
you can have one slap.

21:29.372 --> 21:30.790
Not in the nose!

21:38.089 --> 21:39.382
Wait, I...

21:39.424 --> 21:41.551
Damn, that was quite a slap.

21:48.266 --> 21:49.726
[laughing]

21:49.768 --> 21:51.728
Kyle, can you just
fill this with ice?

21:51.770 --> 21:53.063
Yeah.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.397
We have to just bring
heaps of ice from the laz.

21:54.439 --> 21:55.607
I’m gonna bring bags, actually.

21:57.525 --> 21:59.819
Look how exciting.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.279
I’m so excited for
them to see it.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.364
That actually looks really good.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.782
So, where were you before this?

22:03.823 --> 22:04.991
Have you, like, taken a vacay?

22:05.033 --> 22:06.076
Basically.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.410
Also, I’ve just
been back at home.

22:07.452 --> 22:08.411
-Where’s home?
-Cape Town.

22:08.453 --> 22:09.579
Where are you from?

22:09.621 --> 22:11.373
Australia.

22:11.414 --> 22:12.457
Are we close to each other?

22:12.499 --> 22:13.708
What?

22:13.750 --> 22:15.251
I don’t know geography.

22:15.293 --> 22:16.878
[laughing]

22:16.920 --> 22:18.922
I’m just gonna put these
bottles on the table, aren’t I?

22:18.963 --> 22:19.798
Straight up.

22:19.839 --> 22:20.924
Are you gonna wear your ascot?

22:20.965 --> 22:22.092
I’m gonna... no, I’m not.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.093
You’re not?

22:23.134 --> 22:24.177
Can I come with you guys

22:24.219 --> 22:25.428
when you take the guests
to the tables?

22:25.470 --> 22:26.596
Yes.

22:26.638 --> 22:28.056
Because I wanna
see their reaction.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.724
-Of course, it’s your table.
-Oh, my God.

22:29.766 --> 22:32.519
Hey, the decorations
are absolutely beautiful.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.604
-Woo-hoo!
-Thanks, Cap.

22:34.646 --> 22:37.065
Thanks, guys, for all your help.

22:38.650 --> 22:40.235
-Okay, are we ready?
-We’re ready.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.112
Yeah, there we go,
that’s much better.

22:42.153 --> 22:43.405
-Like this?
-Yeah.

22:43.446 --> 22:45.490
This prom king and
queen right here.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.950
Go on with your bad self.

22:49.577 --> 22:53.707
* Happy anniversary to you *

22:53.748 --> 22:56.292
* Happy anniversary to you *

22:56.334 --> 22:57.711
Oh, this is beautiful!

22:57.752 --> 22:59.587
Oh, this looks amazing.

22:59.629 --> 23:02.424
This is beautiful.

23:02.465 --> 23:03.883
So, what are we sending out?

23:03.925 --> 23:08.596
Tuna nigiri, salmon,
Japanese tuna tartare.

23:08.638 --> 23:12.183
Then we got salmon maki rolls
and a vegetarian maki roll.

23:12.225 --> 23:13.893
There’s a lot of pressure
on with dinner tonight.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.520
Yeah, we’ll take some stuff now.

23:15.562 --> 23:20.900
So, gonna be hard on myself, and
fingers crossed, they like it.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.277
Oh!

23:22.318 --> 23:23.528
So nice.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.821
I liked the steak
last night, but...

23:24.863 --> 23:27.157
The steak was good.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.450
The whole meal
wasn’t consistent.

23:28.491 --> 23:29.617
Thank you.

23:29.659 --> 23:30.660
Can we start eating?

23:30.702 --> 23:32.203
No stress.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.791
Get out of here with
how delicious this is.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.335
It’s so good.

23:38.376 --> 23:39.336
It’s so incredible.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.378
It’s so amazing.

23:40.420 --> 23:44.507
-So incredible.
-Gorgeous.

23:44.549 --> 23:46.217
Lovely.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.554
So lovely.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.889
I’ve got a soup.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.807
Mzi!

23:52.849 --> 23:54.184
Woo!

23:56.394 --> 23:58.396
Holy ----ing sh--.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.731
It’s so good.

23:59.773 --> 24:01.191
All right, I’ve gotta
do this cake.

24:04.569 --> 24:05.737
Yeah.

24:05.779 --> 24:07.989
Were you a bosun
on your last boat?

24:08.031 --> 24:09.157
Oh, yeah?

24:11.659 --> 24:13.203
And literally everything,
all the equipment,

24:13.244 --> 24:15.914
like, just came on,
and was in interior,

24:15.955 --> 24:17.415
we helped the interior a lot.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.000
Heaps.

24:19.042 --> 24:21.461
I’m feeling a bit disappointed
with not being able

24:21.503 --> 24:23.129
to get everything in place,

24:23.171 --> 24:25.215
and nothing’s
how it should be.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.550
Once we have a system, I mean,
you as an officer know...

24:27.592 --> 24:29.094
Yeah.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.595
Like, systems are put
in place for a reason, so...

24:30.637 --> 24:32.889
I don’t panic
about things either.

24:32.931 --> 24:35.934
Like, I was a chief stew, I was
a housekeeper, I was a deckhand.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.227
I’ve been a chief officer,

24:37.268 --> 24:39.312
second officer,
and I’ve been a captain.

24:39.354 --> 24:42.065
Everyone can have different
experience in different areas.

24:42.107 --> 24:44.901
So, obviously, I know for
a fact I am capable of my job,

24:44.943 --> 24:46.736
and I know what I’m doing.

24:46.778 --> 24:48.279
It’s just I’m only one person,

24:48.321 --> 24:50.532
and I can’t be
everywhere at the same time.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.617
All right,
time to clock off for...

24:52.659 --> 24:54.244
Let’s go.

24:54.285 --> 24:55.995
An hour or two.

24:56.037 --> 24:58.832
Your colors are pink and pink.

24:58.873 --> 25:01.376
-That’s great.
-Do you know that?

25:01.418 --> 25:02.377
You don’t get that quote?

25:02.419 --> 25:03.670
No.

25:03.712 --> 25:04.713
-It’s from "Steel Magnolias."
-Oh.

25:04.754 --> 25:05.964
You really never?

25:06.006 --> 25:07.382
Okay, so, we have to
run through

25:07.424 --> 25:09.300
the catalogue of gay movies
that you have to watch.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.136
You’ve seen "To Wong Foo, Thanks
for Everything, Julie Newmar?"

25:11.177 --> 25:12.095
-Never.
-What?

25:12.137 --> 25:13.638
We are watching
that tonight.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.931
Oh, "But I’m a Cheerleader,"
have you seen that?

25:14.973 --> 25:16.266
-No.
-So good.

25:16.307 --> 25:17.767
Oh, yeah, have you
seen "Mommie Dearest?"

25:17.809 --> 25:21.021
-No.
-Ah!

25:21.062 --> 25:23.273
I would take your gay card
if you had one, but you don’t.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.191
-Imagine that, yeah.
-That’s terrible.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.193
We’re gonna usher you
into the community.

25:27.235 --> 25:30.405
<i>Tash, Tash, Dave.</i>
<i>Can we run dessert?</i>

25:30.447 --> 25:31.489
Okay, copy.

25:31.531 --> 25:34.075
----ing well done, sir.
Jesus.

25:34.117 --> 25:35.952
That looks a delight.
It’s my birthday soon, eh?

25:35.994 --> 25:37.203
Is it?
Let me know, man.

25:37.245 --> 25:38.413
-Yeah.
-I’ll make you a cake.

25:38.455 --> 25:39.456
You gonna present that?

25:39.497 --> 25:40.665
Do you want me to present it?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.375
-I think you should.
-All right.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.380
Wow.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.382
David!

25:49.424 --> 25:52.427
-Bravo!
-Oh!

25:52.469 --> 25:53.887
Coming up...

25:53.928 --> 25:55.930
So, again, thank you
all for everything.

25:55.972 --> 25:59.184
Deck crew, it took a little
time to get the toys out.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.644
Just, it didn’t feel connected.

26:11.279 --> 26:11.488
Wow.

26:14.115 --> 26:15.367
David.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.911
-Bravo.
-Oh!

26:20.038 --> 26:21.831
That would have been
catastrophic.

26:21.873 --> 26:24.542
Well, happy anniversary.

26:24.584 --> 26:27.629
-Thank you so much.
-Yay!

26:27.671 --> 26:28.630
All right.

26:28.672 --> 26:29.881
Yes?

26:29.923 --> 26:32.050
I’m looking for
a big, pink penis.

26:32.092 --> 26:33.677
-It’s really good.
-It’s delicious.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.011
Yes.

26:35.053 --> 26:37.389
Where is the pink penis?
We know you took it.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.057
-Excuse me?
-We know you took it.

26:39.099 --> 26:40.100
I have no idea what
you’re talking about.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.477
He’s more of a red rocket.

26:42.519 --> 26:46.231
But if you did don’t ----ing
talk to me like that again...

26:46.272 --> 26:48.316
I’m gonna go and make a display
on the owner’s bed now.

26:48.358 --> 26:49.359
[gasps]

26:49.401 --> 26:51.236
These guests seem like
so much fun,

26:51.277 --> 26:53.488
so the typical
turn-down chocolate

26:53.530 --> 26:54.823
is not gonna work for them.

26:54.864 --> 26:56.116
We need to step this up a notch.

26:56.157 --> 26:59.244
Feathers, eye masks,
edible underwear.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.413
Going from being solo stew to,
like,

27:01.454 --> 27:05.250
having to work with a team, I’m,
like, super excited about it.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.794
Love being around people,
and like good vibes.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.297
I don’t even know
what that means.

27:12.924 --> 27:14.551
This is our lives.

27:14.592 --> 27:15.593
Storm, to the bridge.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.178
Can we change now?

27:17.220 --> 27:18.221
Yeah.

27:18.263 --> 27:19.931
-Okay, here.
-Here, put this on.

27:19.973 --> 27:21.683
-Are you gonna do PJs?
-Yeah.

27:21.725 --> 27:23.143
-Okay.
-PJ party!

27:25.603 --> 27:26.646
[laughing]

27:26.688 --> 27:29.107
Welcome home.

27:29.149 --> 27:30.525
-Oh, my God.
-No, look.

27:30.567 --> 27:33.111
Your every seduction
will be tantalized.

27:33.153 --> 27:34.821
What is happening right now?

27:34.863 --> 27:38.283
That’s the worst accent
I’ve ever done in my life.

27:40.243 --> 27:41.369
Hey.

27:41.411 --> 27:42.537
Have a great anniversary,
all right, guys.

27:42.579 --> 27:43.997
Thank you guys so much.

27:44.039 --> 27:46.958
It’ll be tricky tomorrow
going into the marina.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.127
How are you at
calling distances?

27:51.004 --> 27:53.048
We gotta go through two
very narrow dolphins.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.132
Yeah, I’ve seen.

27:54.174 --> 27:55.592
Yeah, so it’s like driving in.

27:55.633 --> 27:58.053
This marina, basically
it’s a wind tunnel,

27:58.094 --> 28:00.138
and on top of that,
there’s a current.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.766
Plus, you have dolphins placed
really close together,

28:02.807 --> 28:04.559
which makes it more
difficult to dock.

28:04.601 --> 28:07.604
So, I need two people
calling distances.

28:07.645 --> 28:09.647
I’m choosing to put Raygan
on the bow because

28:09.689 --> 28:12.233
I can actually see the down the
side of the boat to the stern,

28:12.275 --> 28:14.027
but I can’t see to the bow.

28:14.069 --> 28:16.154
I liked how Storm
took charge on deck,

28:16.196 --> 28:19.824
and I wanna see how he does
calling distances on the stern.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.326
There’s no room for error.

28:21.368 --> 28:23.328
-I’m gonna go to bed.
-All right.

28:23.370 --> 28:25.330
Thanks.

28:25.372 --> 28:28.792
This is cute!

28:28.833 --> 28:30.210
Look at you, queen.

28:30.251 --> 28:31.795
Oh!

28:31.836 --> 28:34.005
Next project.

28:34.047 --> 28:36.174
The reason I love
working on boats is

28:36.216 --> 28:38.051
because you’re
always around people.

28:38.093 --> 28:40.679
At home, my home
is the party house.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.263
I’m the last one to bed,

28:42.305 --> 28:45.183
just because I love
to keep people up all night

28:45.225 --> 28:46.810
with my cocktail making.

28:46.851 --> 28:51.022
On boats I’m also the one
who loves to be on nights

28:51.064 --> 28:54.192
because I just love
to see the guests party.

28:54.234 --> 28:56.695
A raspberry vodka
mixed with curaçao.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.196
I love this.

28:58.238 --> 28:59.989
Even though I
might not be drinking, like,

29:00.031 --> 29:01.157
I’m still having fun.

29:01.199 --> 29:03.034
Oh, it’s delicious.

29:09.666 --> 29:11.126
Oh!

29:11.167 --> 29:12.544
That’s exactly
what I was gonna say.

29:12.585 --> 29:13.795
Ah... oh!

29:13.837 --> 29:15.797
I’ve never had
a relationship longer than,

29:15.839 --> 29:17.590
like, a couple months.

29:17.632 --> 29:18.967
I’m super picky.

29:19.009 --> 29:22.220
Like, I would never live
with a guy unless

29:22.262 --> 29:25.223
he can have his own
separate bedroom where he can,

29:25.265 --> 29:27.475
like, you know, mess up
his own bathroom and stuff,

29:27.517 --> 29:29.477
and like, that can
get cleaned once a week.

29:29.519 --> 29:32.564
I bring a lot to the table,
so if they don’t wanna meet me

29:32.605 --> 29:36.192
halfway with anything, like,
I’m pretty happy being alone.

29:39.029 --> 29:39.988
How is it, big guy?

29:40.030 --> 29:41.072
Are you on com?

29:41.114 --> 29:42.907
I’ve written a list down here.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.743
Come get me
if you need me, yeah?

29:44.784 --> 29:45.702
Yeah, sure.

29:47.871 --> 29:50.623
-Good night, all.
-Good night.

29:50.665 --> 29:53.585
-Good night.
-Good night.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.253
I’m going to bed now.

29:55.295 --> 29:56.588
Did they like your gift?

29:56.629 --> 29:57.714
Which one?

29:57.756 --> 29:59.382
Oh, yeah.

29:59.424 --> 30:01.259
-Oh, my God.
-No, look.

30:01.301 --> 30:03.595
What is happening
right now?

30:03.636 --> 30:05.388
Kyle was sitting on the chair
in the master,

30:05.430 --> 30:08.308
and I was, like, posing next
to him with a feather,

30:08.350 --> 30:10.018
just tickling him,
while he wore the mask.

30:10.060 --> 30:13.772
And I would turn, I was like,
"Oh, my God, I’m so sorry."

30:13.813 --> 30:14.814
Natalya’s really gorgeous.

30:14.856 --> 30:15.815
She’s got a lot of energy.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.233
Aussies are my kryptonite.

30:17.275 --> 30:19.110
I actually had an
Australian girl’s name

30:19.152 --> 30:20.737
tattooed here on my leg,

30:20.779 --> 30:23.615
but now there’s a big
panther face on it, so.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.241
[laughing]

30:25.283 --> 30:27.243
You’ve really gotta be
on their game in terms

30:27.285 --> 30:29.287
of banter to even get
anywhere near them.

30:29.329 --> 30:30.747
I ----ing love it, it’s so good.

30:30.789 --> 30:31.998
Sleep well.

30:32.040 --> 30:32.999
All right, I’ll see you
in the morning.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.167
See you in the morning.

30:48.807 --> 30:50.392
God.

31:38.690 --> 31:40.066
Oh!

31:42.902 --> 31:44.863
-Morning.
-Good morning.

31:44.904 --> 31:47.532
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

31:47.574 --> 31:49.576
Deck crew, deck crew,
meet me on the aft deck.

31:49.617 --> 31:52.078
Copy.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.204
Can I get some water?

31:53.246 --> 31:54.706
For this first docking,

31:54.748 --> 31:57.167
I’m gonna be on the
leeward side of the wind.

31:57.208 --> 31:58.543
-Okay.
-You just gotta...

31:58.585 --> 31:59.627
the dolphins.

31:59.669 --> 32:00.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:00.962 --> 32:02.380
So, basically, I’ll be
able to see the one.

32:02.422 --> 32:04.549
Going into this docking,
I’m concerned

32:04.591 --> 32:06.509
with the wind direction and
the current direction.

32:06.551 --> 32:08.345
It makes it difficult
to maneuver,

32:08.386 --> 32:10.847
and unlike the other
marina last season,

32:10.889 --> 32:13.308
we had tenders that
would pull the dolphins apart

32:13.350 --> 32:14.976
so I could fit through.

32:15.018 --> 32:16.394
We don’t have that here.

32:16.436 --> 32:17.979
-So, you two are on the bow.
-Me and Jason.

32:18.021 --> 32:19.230
He’s on the aft deck, yeah.

32:19.272 --> 32:22.150
After all, I don’t hit things.

32:22.192 --> 32:23.985
We’re gonna get underway now.

32:24.027 --> 32:26.112
I’m gonna start ’em up, and
we’re gonna haul the anchor.

32:34.037 --> 32:35.747
-Good to go?
-Yeah.

32:35.789 --> 32:36.748
Beautiful.

32:36.790 --> 32:39.626
Okay, start
hauling the anchor.

32:39.668 --> 32:40.669
Copy.

32:43.463 --> 32:45.340
One shackle at the water.

32:47.342 --> 32:48.885
-Anchor is at home.
-Thank you.

32:48.927 --> 32:52.555
All crew, all crew,
we will be getting underway.

32:55.517 --> 32:56.518
Oh!

32:56.559 --> 32:58.561
-How did you sleep?
-Morning, love.

32:58.603 --> 32:59.771
Dead.

33:01.940 --> 33:04.442
Deck crew, deck crew,
are you guys ready?

33:04.484 --> 33:05.443
All fenders are ready.

33:05.485 --> 33:08.363
All fenders and lines are ready.

33:08.405 --> 33:11.991
First docking with
this crew, new marina,

33:12.033 --> 33:14.411
and it’s critical that
everyone do their job.

33:14.452 --> 33:15.954
<i>Raygan, Raygan,</i>
<i>you’re just gonna</i>

33:15.995 --> 33:17.372
<i>use your hands on the bow.</i>

33:17.414 --> 33:18.873
I’m gonna swing it to starboard.

33:18.915 --> 33:20.417
All clear.

33:30.593 --> 33:31.636
Raygan, is it all clear
to swing the bow?

33:33.555 --> 33:35.807
Yeah, it’s all clear.

33:35.849 --> 33:38.435
Storm, Storm,
what’s the distance

33:38.476 --> 33:39.853
off my port with the dolphins?

33:39.894 --> 33:41.980
Port stern, you’re
about 20 meters.

33:42.022 --> 33:43.356
Okay, get your lines ready.

33:43.398 --> 33:45.859
<i>Twenty meters</i>
<i>off your port beam.</i>

33:45.900 --> 33:48.611
Ten meters and closing.

33:48.653 --> 33:50.822
-Pretty tight squeeze.
-Yeah.

33:50.864 --> 33:52.699
<i>One meter and holding.</i>

34:02.083 --> 34:04.753
They need a valet
that’ll bring these boats in.

34:07.047 --> 34:08.089
Hold it there.

34:08.131 --> 34:10.759
The port line is...

34:10.800 --> 34:12.344
Okay, pull it in.

34:16.348 --> 34:18.433
Well done, everyone,
thank you very much.

34:19.851 --> 34:22.270
----ing thank God.

34:22.312 --> 34:25.774
<i>We are secure in our berth at</i>
<i>the Grand Harbor Marina, over.</i>

34:28.276 --> 34:29.444
Did you get
everything out of the bathroom?

34:30.695 --> 34:33.448
All crew, all crew,
get into your whites.

34:36.159 --> 34:39.829
What time do the fumigators come
in and spray the deck down?

34:39.871 --> 34:43.291
All crew, all crew, meet on
the dock for guest departure.

34:43.333 --> 34:44.876
I have such a wedgie right now.

34:44.918 --> 34:46.002
Are we going?

34:49.339 --> 34:50.757
-Thank you, sir.
-Good.

34:50.799 --> 34:51.925
-Oh!
-Thank you guys so much.

34:51.966 --> 34:53.093
It was a pleasure.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.594
We’re both running to hug you.

34:54.636 --> 34:57.555
Yeah.

34:57.597 --> 35:00.475
Oh!
If I have to.

35:01.726 --> 35:03.603
-Give us a hug?
-Yes, thank you.

35:03.645 --> 35:05.021
You’re incredible.

35:06.356 --> 35:07.607
Oh, thank you so much.

35:07.649 --> 35:08.942
-You’re incredible.
-Appreciate it.

35:08.983 --> 35:10.068
-Thank you.
-Sandy, you’re the best.

35:10.110 --> 35:11.403
No, you are.

35:11.444 --> 35:12.779
So, again, thank you
all for everything.

35:12.821 --> 35:14.739
Interior, you’re incredible.

35:14.781 --> 35:16.199
Like, we travel
around the world,

35:16.241 --> 35:18.076
and the best service
we’ve ever had.

35:18.118 --> 35:19.577
Yeah.

35:19.619 --> 35:21.788
And then deck crew,
it didn’t feel connected.

35:21.830 --> 35:25.625
It took a little time to
get the toys out, you know?

35:25.667 --> 35:27.293
Anyway, this is for you...
thank you.

35:27.335 --> 35:28.503
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

35:28.545 --> 35:30.630
-Thank you guys so much.
-And bon voyage.

35:30.672 --> 35:32.590
-Bon voyage!
-Bon voyage!

35:32.632 --> 35:33.591
Bye, guys, thank you.

35:33.633 --> 35:35.176
-Bye.
-Bye.

35:35.218 --> 35:37.971
All right, everyone, out of
your whites and into your reds,

35:38.013 --> 35:40.849
and let’s meet in the main salon
for our tip meeting.

35:40.890 --> 35:43.393
Dah, dah, dah!

35:45.687 --> 35:48.273
Ooh, I can’t wait to put
something cold in my mouth.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.483
-Good start.
-Yes.

36:01.411 --> 36:02.704
Nice!

36:03.621 --> 36:05.832
I just wanna say
congratulations.

36:05.874 --> 36:08.752
Down two deck crew,
boat malfunctioning,

36:08.793 --> 36:12.964
the fact that we were able
to pull it off is incredible.

36:13.006 --> 36:16.551
Interior, you guys really
carried us through the charter

36:16.593 --> 36:18.011
and I just want
to acknowledge that...

36:18.053 --> 36:18.887
thank you.

36:18.928 --> 36:20.513
And you’re an awesome chef,

36:20.555 --> 36:21.514
and I feel really grateful
to have you on board.

36:21.556 --> 36:23.516
Excited to be here.

36:23.558 --> 36:24.559
-[applause]
-Aw!

36:24.601 --> 36:26.186
The food for us, you killed it.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.812
So, okay.

36:27.854 --> 36:31.858
You guys, on deck, we definitely
have some training to do there.

36:33.902 --> 36:36.321
The client made that known.

36:36.363 --> 36:39.532
We were down two, it wasn’t
really fair to the deck crew,

36:39.574 --> 36:41.993
but I feel like
we should have pulled it up

36:42.035 --> 36:43.370
another notch, okay?

36:43.411 --> 36:46.414
Next charter,
I want it organized.

36:47.457 --> 36:51.002
Okay, so, $27,000.

36:51.044 --> 36:53.296
Holy sh--!

36:53.338 --> 36:56.883
Which is $2,454 per person.

36:56.925 --> 36:59.886
-Whoa!
-Woo!

37:01.388 --> 37:02.389
Well done, everybody.

37:02.430 --> 37:04.432
Well done, cheers!

37:04.474 --> 37:05.725
Thank you.

37:05.767 --> 37:06.893
That’s all you’re
drinking, guys.

37:06.935 --> 37:08.728
-Work, work, work.
-Yeah.

37:13.942 --> 37:15.819
You smell like updog, brü.

37:15.860 --> 37:17.570
What?

37:17.612 --> 37:19.239
You smell like updog.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.574
-I smell?
-Like updog.

37:21.616 --> 37:23.410
What’s updog?

37:23.451 --> 37:24.619
[laughing]

37:29.624 --> 37:30.917
I got it.

37:30.959 --> 37:32.585
Don’t do it, go do
your other stuff.

37:32.627 --> 37:33.586
You have tons of stuff to
do, don’t touch it.

37:33.628 --> 37:35.171
Don’t even look at it.

37:35.213 --> 37:37.549
I think we’re all done,
aren’t we?

37:37.590 --> 37:39.384
-Almost, just that side.
-Yeah.

37:39.426 --> 37:40.593
You all right?

37:40.635 --> 37:42.929
Well done, you.
Ah!

37:42.971 --> 37:45.598
I fell into your arms...
good catch.

37:45.640 --> 37:48.309
Just like us,
catching our drinks

37:48.351 --> 37:50.478
and cake and whatever else.

37:52.731 --> 37:54.232
Kyle, are you going glam?

37:54.274 --> 37:55.316
Yeah, hon.

37:55.358 --> 37:56.985
Sexy, but cute
but like broody?

37:57.027 --> 37:59.320
Like take me home
and shag me filthy.

37:59.362 --> 38:00.947
Okay, cool, I’m glad we’re
on the same page.

38:05.118 --> 38:07.620
It’s a woman’s blouse,
so everything’s backwards.

38:07.662 --> 38:09.664
I’m obsessed with that blouse.

38:09.706 --> 38:12.542
I feel like I haven’t
got dressed up for years.

38:12.584 --> 38:15.337
The crazy side of me
would come from my mom.

38:15.378 --> 38:16.921
When I was about 16...

38:23.094 --> 38:26.181
So, yeah, it’ll be
interesting to see what mischief

38:26.222 --> 38:27.640
will be going on.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.186
But tonight, we’re drinking
from the...

38:31.227 --> 38:33.104
Dah, dah, dah

38:34.314 --> 38:36.191
Woohoo!

38:37.525 --> 38:40.945
Guys, I’m so excited
to get wasted.

38:40.987 --> 38:42.530
Can I say this is
the best-looking crew

38:42.572 --> 38:44.157
I’ve ever worked
with in my life?

38:44.199 --> 38:50.205
Never have I ever banged two
crewmembers on the same boat.

38:54.250 --> 38:55.877
Yeah?

38:59.339 --> 39:00.924
No.

39:00.965 --> 39:02.342
-Did you... what?
-You are.

39:02.384 --> 39:04.678
No, we’re not.

39:04.719 --> 39:05.720
Why is everyone looking at me?

39:05.762 --> 39:07.180
You completely are.

39:07.222 --> 39:08.765
No, we’re not,
bro, we’re not dating.

39:08.807 --> 39:09.766
You’re not dating?

39:09.808 --> 39:11.226
But you’re in love.

39:11.267 --> 39:12.560
You’re in love,
but you’re just not dating.

39:12.602 --> 39:14.604
Um...

39:14.646 --> 39:16.064
no, like, five weeks.

39:17.857 --> 39:20.068
So, we just did a month
together on a charter.

39:21.653 --> 39:23.571
No.

39:29.119 --> 39:30.078
Coming up...

39:31.871 --> 39:34.916
I want to be a couple,
but we’re not a couple.

39:48.221 --> 39:50.223
Oh, my God,
that place looks great.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.102
Here you go, lovely.

39:54.144 --> 39:55.103
Thank you.

39:55.145 --> 39:56.771
How are you?

39:56.813 --> 39:58.273
Eight tequila shots
to start, please.

39:58.314 --> 39:59.315
Yes, please.

39:59.357 --> 40:00.608
Okay, guys, what about food?

40:00.650 --> 40:02.485
The risotto, yeah.

40:02.527 --> 40:03.862
Octopus.

40:03.903 --> 40:05.238
The Thai beef salad.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.448
Thank you.

40:06.489 --> 40:08.450
Since you’ve joined the boat...

40:08.491 --> 40:09.951
Since you’ve joined the boat,

40:09.993 --> 40:11.036
I’ve actually been really upset,
and I’ve...

40:11.077 --> 40:12.287
I didn’t finish my sentence.

40:12.328 --> 40:13.163
Sorry, I got distracted.

40:13.204 --> 40:14.664
She always steals my thunder.

40:14.706 --> 40:16.124
I get lost in her
----ing Goddamn eyes.

40:16.166 --> 40:17.417
I’ve got a thing for
Australians, man.

40:17.459 --> 40:18.460
You do?

40:18.501 --> 40:20.587
[bleep] me.

40:20.628 --> 40:26.634
Storm’s got this rugged, pirate,
homeless, hot look to him.

40:26.676 --> 40:28.136
I’m into it.

40:28.178 --> 40:30.805
But Storm’s moustache
needs to go.

40:30.847 --> 40:32.223
No, no, no.

40:33.308 --> 40:34.184
Never.

40:34.225 --> 40:36.936
I don’t think I have I top lip.

40:36.978 --> 40:40.982
I’m an Australian
absolute lover.

40:41.024 --> 40:43.777
Do you wanna go down...
no, I’m kidding.

40:43.818 --> 40:45.737
-You wanna get down under?
-Let’s go!

40:46.654 --> 40:49.157
Yay!

40:49.199 --> 40:51.701
-Thank you.
-You’re a legend.

40:52.577 --> 40:53.661
-Cheers.
-Cheers, guys.

40:53.703 --> 40:54.662
A salute to the new family.

40:54.704 --> 40:56.289
First trip of the season.

40:56.331 --> 40:59.542
Let’s see who rips each
other’s eyes out at the end.

40:59.584 --> 41:03.713
Everyone’s just got such a
different vibe going on, like...

41:08.510 --> 41:11.012
Do you know what, I didn’t
realize you had long hair

41:11.054 --> 41:12.514
until you got in the water.

41:12.555 --> 41:15.850
-After, he’s like, ugh!
-Well, it’s annoying.

41:20.522 --> 41:23.274
You’re, like, Catwoman,
Veronica, is, like,

41:23.316 --> 41:24.818
hot, like, mm...

41:24.859 --> 41:26.528
Then what’s your vibe?

41:26.569 --> 41:30.240
Someone tell me what my vibe is.

41:30.281 --> 41:32.867
-Prrr!
-Oh, that’s a good one.

41:34.828 --> 41:36.621
Thank you very much.

41:36.663 --> 41:39.416
Yeah, 100 percent.

41:40.792 --> 41:41.835
This is ----ing delicious.

41:41.876 --> 41:43.712
Mine’s really good.

41:43.753 --> 41:44.754
Oh, my God.

41:44.796 --> 41:46.047
Oh, that’s really good.

41:46.089 --> 41:48.049
-Yeah, we need to go for a wee.
-Come on.

41:49.592 --> 41:51.052
I heard.

41:51.094 --> 41:53.138
If we were a couple,
then we would be a couple.

41:53.179 --> 41:56.975
Okay, so, Storm
is the most experienced.

41:59.102 --> 42:01.229
How do you know? Oh.

42:01.271 --> 42:02.897
No, but you’re
in a cabin together

42:02.939 --> 42:05.358
and you work together,
and we think you are.

42:05.400 --> 42:06.526
No, you’re wrong.

42:12.115 --> 42:16.202
I want to be a couple,
but we’re not a couple, so...

42:16.244 --> 42:17.162
Oh, my God.

42:17.203 --> 42:19.372
But hang on...
but one sec.

42:29.632 --> 42:30.925
Um...

42:32.302 --> 42:35.013
Nah, nah, it’s all good, bro.

42:46.858 --> 42:48.276
[bleep] it.

42:48.318 --> 42:51.529
On our last boat, me and
Tash, we had, like, this...

42:51.571 --> 42:53.782
and we have had this connection,

42:53.823 --> 42:55.867
and that’s when
we got together.

42:57.160 --> 43:00.121
Tash asked me to keep it
a secret,

43:00.163 --> 43:03.583
because she was
still with her boyfriend.

43:05.210 --> 43:07.170
But she said they’re basically,

43:07.212 --> 43:09.422
like, broken up,
they’re not getting on.

43:09.464 --> 43:13.760
There’s a lot of stuff
going on there.

43:13.802 --> 43:16.137
So, now I’m struggling
with keeping it a secret.

43:16.179 --> 43:18.890
Like, it’s really,
really difficult.

43:18.932 --> 43:20.558
You stay right there.

43:20.600 --> 43:21.893
I’m gonna do this.

43:21.935 --> 43:23.645
This might take days...
it might take weeks.

43:23.687 --> 43:25.647
Hey!

43:25.689 --> 43:26.815
Oh, my God, hi.

43:26.856 --> 43:28.400
We’re back.

43:39.536 --> 43:41.162
What is he doing?

43:48.378 --> 43:51.423
I’ve made it clear that
I don’t want anyone to know.

43:54.884 --> 43:57.345
Okay.

43:57.387 --> 43:59.472
It’s only a matter of time

43:59.514 --> 44:01.057
before he tells everybody that
we hooked up.

44:02.809 --> 44:04.060
Ugh.
