00:50.850 --> 00:54.389
Welcome to the Brinkley School
and our first grade show.

00:54.390 --> 00:56.229
I'm George Hanson,
and this afternoon we

00:56.230 --> 00:58.709
are proud to present
our own adaptation

00:58.710 --> 01:01.249
of "The Little Mermaid."

01:01.250 --> 01:03.689
Music will be provided
by the Brinkley Trio led

01:03.690 --> 01:06.080
by my co-teacher Melissa Marx.

01:11.250 --> 01:13.749
And now on with the show.

01:13.750 --> 01:14.449
Hi.

01:14.450 --> 01:15.899
I'm Nina Borowski.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.929
And I think all of you are new
here, so welcome to the Cobble.

01:18.930 --> 01:20.829
Hill Community Centre.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.859
I'll be your group
leader, and we

01:22.860 --> 01:26.169
could talk about whatever
you'd like... school,

01:26.170 --> 01:32.399
home, jobs, sex, anything.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.870
Sea Snakes.

01:36.850 --> 01:38.629
Sting rays.

01:38.630 --> 01:39.330
Ooh!

01:43.780 --> 01:45.789
I miss anything?

01:45.790 --> 01:47.469
Honey, I just signed Castro.

01:47.470 --> 01:48.259
Shh!

01:48.260 --> 01:53.560
Sally, you're on.

01:55.010 --> 01:56.939
Ew!

01:56.940 --> 02:00.799
I know exactly what
you've come for.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.359
Well, this boy
I've been seeing,

02:02.360 --> 02:03.349
and now he wants to fuck me.

02:03.350 --> 02:05.649
He's only gonna hurt you.

02:05.650 --> 02:07.039
Well, do want to fuck him?

02:07.040 --> 02:08.739
Well, he's cute.

02:08.740 --> 02:10.098
Hey, he's like men.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.899
Does he say he loves you?

02:11.900 --> 02:14.069
Yeah, but he just wants
to get in my pants.

02:14.070 --> 02:15.639
But do you love him?

02:15.640 --> 02:17.739
Nina, isn't that right?

02:17.740 --> 02:20.189
Well, I don't know about that.

02:20.190 --> 02:23.059
But what I do know is,
if I have sex with a guy

02:23.060 --> 02:25.399
I want him to be my friend.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.479
So let's start with,
do you like him?

02:27.480 --> 02:31.919
I will give you anything
if I can have my prince.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.889
Come with me then.

02:33.890 --> 02:37.839
And whilst my slave girl
weaves her magic spell

02:37.840 --> 02:40.790
I will cut off your tongue.

02:41.780 --> 02:44.250
Play girl, play!

02:54.390 --> 02:55.090
Where is he?

02:58.540 --> 03:00.709
Who are looking for, George?

03:00.710 --> 03:03.689
Just a friend of mine.

03:03.690 --> 03:05.379
He says if I don't fuck him,

03:05.380 --> 03:06.649
he's going to find
another girlfriend.

03:06.650 --> 03:09.929
All right look, Keesha, I don't
claim to be an expert on love.

03:09.930 --> 03:13.369
But I do know it can
screw up your life.

03:13.370 --> 03:14.809
So should I do it?

03:14.810 --> 03:16.979
You can say no.

03:16.980 --> 03:20.669
Keeping your boyfriend happy
is not your full-time job.

03:20.670 --> 03:27.119
You've got school, family,
work, your friends.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.210
You call the shots.

03:31.690 --> 03:32.679
You guys were great!

03:32.680 --> 03:33.669
All right, let them prove it.

03:33.670 --> 03:34.160
Excuse us.

03:34.161 --> 03:34.859
Come on.

03:34.860 --> 03:35.649
All right, get in line.

03:35.650 --> 03:36.140
Get in line.

03:36.140 --> 03:36.640
Hey!

03:36.640 --> 03:37.130
Shh.

03:37.131 --> 03:37.829
Just a minute.

03:37.830 --> 03:40.600
All right.

03:46.540 --> 03:47.529
Daddy!

03:47.530 --> 03:49.009
Oh, you were great!

03:49.010 --> 03:50.499
You were terrific.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.919
I loved you up there.

03:51.920 --> 03:52.619
Mommy!

03:52.620 --> 03:54.409
Mr. Hanson, that
was a great show.

03:54.410 --> 03:55.509
I think that was you best yet.

03:55.510 --> 03:57.529
Well, hey, we had a great
sea witch and a great cast.

03:57.530 --> 03:59.059
- Wasn't she fabulous?
- Now don't be so humble.

03:59.060 --> 04:00.139
I've seen a lot of kid shoes.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.709
They bore the hell out of me.

04:01.710 --> 04:02.579
This one had grit.

04:02.580 --> 04:03.549
Grit?

04:03.550 --> 04:05.149
Yeah, it was, uh, the
real stuff, you know.

04:05.150 --> 04:06.109
It wasn't all gooey.

04:06.110 --> 04:07.029
Thank you, Mr. Miller.

04:07.030 --> 04:08.139
Call me Sidney.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.019
Come on, guys, let's go.

04:09.020 --> 04:11.089
Uh, George, we're having a
few people over to our house

04:11.090 --> 04:12.009
for dinner tonight.

04:12.010 --> 04:13.169
We'd love it if you'd join us.

04:13.170 --> 04:13.999
Oh, that would be great.

04:14.000 --> 04:14.699
Yeah, do that.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.659
Oh, uh, I'm sorry Mrs. Miller.

04:16.660 --> 04:17.449
I'm meeting a friend.

04:17.450 --> 04:18.319
Oh, well, bring a friend.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.159
It's very casual.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.309
Everyone's dying to meet you.

04:20.310 --> 04:20.769
Yeah.

04:20.771 --> 04:21.469
Really?

04:21.470 --> 04:22.929
Hey, listen, you're a hero.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.919
I mean, who cares if I
can get Fidel $1 million

04:24.920 --> 04:26.679
to write his diary?

04:26.680 --> 04:28.649
You... you're fighting for
the future of this country.

04:28.650 --> 04:29.649
We'll see you at 7:30.

04:29.650 --> 04:30.569
You were so good.

04:30.570 --> 04:34.249
I can't believe
how good you were.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.250
Where's Dr. Joley?

04:38.280 --> 04:42.839
I'd kill my boyfriend
if he missed my show.

04:42.840 --> 04:43.539
Bye, bye.

04:43.540 --> 04:44.000
Bye, guys.

04:44.001 --> 04:44.699
Good job you guys.

04:44.700 --> 04:45.499
See you later, Michael.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.389
It was great.

04:46.390 --> 04:48.259
Just give me back two.

04:48.260 --> 04:49.349
Hey.

04:49.350 --> 04:50.689
Oh, Thank you.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.799
I got stuck in a faculty
meeting, and then the subway.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.519
And then the dog
ate your homework.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.839
See you tomorrow, George.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.989
I... I just hate myself
for missing this.

05:00.990 --> 05:01.779
It's OK, really.

05:01.780 --> 05:02.479
It's OK.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.799
You hungry?

05:03.800 --> 05:04.709
I'm in the mood for sushi.

05:04.710 --> 05:05.539
Oh, I wish.

05:05.540 --> 05:08.959
I just told Constance Miller
we'd have dinner at her house.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.759
I'm sorry, Joley,
she ambushed me.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.959
But don't worry, she
said it was casual.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.859
George, Sidney Miller
is the most powerful

05:15.860 --> 05:18.569
literary agent in the world.

05:18.570 --> 05:20.429
Casual to the Miller's
is not casual to us.

05:20.430 --> 05:22.819
And actually, I was hoping
we could talk tonight, alone.

05:22.820 --> 05:23.729
OK, I'll cancel.

05:23.730 --> 05:26.499
You can't cancel, it's
important for your career.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.019
Come on, we'll talk later.

05:28.020 --> 05:28.879
Are you sure?

05:28.880 --> 05:30.749
Well, I wrote it
as an academic book,

05:30.750 --> 05:33.869
but I think it could be a best
seller, and even a miniseries.

05:33.870 --> 05:37.769
And Sean Connery would make
a great George Bernard Shaw.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.749
Maybe your friend George
could do something with it.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.869
That was a great
show this afternoon.

05:41.870 --> 05:44.299
So did you, uh, go to
a teacher's college?

05:44.300 --> 05:45.689
No, I was pre-med at college.

05:45.690 --> 05:46.599
Oh, god!

05:46.600 --> 05:49.039
You poor mother.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.259
George?

05:50.260 --> 05:53.929
George, I want you to meet my
great friend, Joyce Meyers.

05:53.930 --> 05:55.869
Oh, Joyce.

05:55.870 --> 05:57.389
How are you?

05:57.390 --> 06:00.429
I so wanted to see your
show, but I got caught

06:00.430 --> 06:02.049
up in a lunch for King Hussein.

06:02.050 --> 06:02.869
Oh, how is he?

06:02.870 --> 06:04.089
Sidney's waiting for his book.

06:04.090 --> 06:04.789
Shall we?

06:04.790 --> 06:06.309
Well, Noor is adorable.

06:06.310 --> 06:08.259
And the children!

06:08.260 --> 06:10.159
You know, Ross, he
went to Princeton,

06:10.160 --> 06:12.069
ignored her when
she was just little.

06:12.070 --> 06:13.020
Lisa Holiday!

06:16.360 --> 06:17.279
Now listen, listen to this.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.209
People don't read anything.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.509
We're in a post-literate
society so they don't know

06:20.510 --> 06:23.919
what to do once they're...

06:23.920 --> 06:26.090
Dr. Joley seems to have made
a hit with my stepsister.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.329
How long have you
two been together?

06:31.330 --> 06:32.599
Uh, four years.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.809
You know, Sidney
represents RuPaul.

06:34.810 --> 06:36.099
We'll have you
all over sometime.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.229
Sidney, don't you
think it's time

06:37.230 --> 06:41.279
for a revised encyclopaedia
of the American theatre?

06:41.280 --> 06:43.529
Emery, darling, when's
the Pavarotti gala?

06:43.530 --> 06:44.229
Uh, next week.

06:44.230 --> 06:46.109
You've done
such wonderful things

06:46.110 --> 06:46.809
with that company.

06:46.810 --> 06:51.540
Everyone says you've completely
turned it around, I think.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.199
I adore heavy tenors.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.199
Sounds like your
show was a huge hit.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.269
Yeah, well, the kids
worked really hard.

06:59.270 --> 06:59.969
Hm.

06:59.970 --> 07:01.279
I'm sorry I missed it.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.639
Oh, that's OK.

07:02.640 --> 07:06.200
I was in bed with King Hussein.

07:07.570 --> 07:08.939
George Hanson.

07:08.940 --> 07:11.289
Nina Borowski, hi.

07:11.290 --> 07:13.419
Oh, so you're the stepsister.

07:13.420 --> 07:14.369
Uh-huh.

07:14.370 --> 07:15.069
Yeah.

07:15.070 --> 07:17.639
I bring the income level
down at Constance's parties

07:17.640 --> 07:20.069
by at least three figures.

07:20.070 --> 07:21.689
Yeah, I can help you
in that department.

07:21.690 --> 07:22.389
Oh, thank you.

07:22.390 --> 07:24.679
My pleasure.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.959
I heard all about
you from Dr. Joley.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.800
Sorry about your and him.

07:31.860 --> 07:32.559
Oh!

07:32.560 --> 07:33.539
OK, here we go.

07:33.540 --> 07:34.509
Come here.

07:34.510 --> 07:37.439
Come here.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.589
You see that man who
just walked in, standing

07:39.590 --> 07:41.019
there with my evil stepsister.

07:41.020 --> 07:42.319
Mm-hmm.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.969
That's my husband.

07:43.970 --> 07:45.599
Are you married?

07:45.600 --> 07:46.919
No, I'm not.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.829
But she's hoping that
I'll marry that man,

07:48.830 --> 07:50.199
because she hates my boyfriend.

07:50.200 --> 07:54.659
Oh, uh, there's my stepsister
Nina, you'll meet her later.

07:54.660 --> 07:56.099
And excuse me.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.199
Oh, Joyce...

07:58.200 --> 07:59.369
All right, we're clear.

07:59.370 --> 08:00.069
Oh!

08:00.070 --> 08:01.719
She's always doing this to me.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.419
Why?

08:02.420 --> 08:06.839
Oh, because my boyfriend's
a penniless legal aid lawyer.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.379
I'm a counsellor at
a community centre.

08:09.380 --> 08:11.849
And I live in a
walk-up in Brooklyn.

08:11.850 --> 08:13.239
Oh, well, it sounds fine to me.

08:13.240 --> 08:13.939
I love Brooklyn.

08:13.940 --> 08:16.109
Yeah, me too.

08:16.110 --> 08:18.609
You know, you should... you
should come and visit me.

08:18.610 --> 08:20.889
I mean, there's some really nice
apartments in my neighbourhood.

08:20.890 --> 08:22.739
I'm afraid I'm not
looking for an apartment.

08:22.740 --> 08:23.739
You're not?

08:23.740 --> 08:25.469
No, I live with Joley.

08:25.470 --> 08:26.799
But he told me at
dinner that you might

08:26.800 --> 08:29.229
be looking for a place soon.

08:29.230 --> 08:31.169
Well, he told you what?

08:31.170 --> 08:33.188
Actually, when he found
out I had a spare room

08:33.190 --> 08:35.269
he asked if you could
move in with me.

08:35.270 --> 08:36.099
That's insane.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.679
Well, I thought so.

08:38.679 --> 08:42.099
It's not every day I invite the
lover of my dinner companion

08:42.100 --> 08:43.629
to live with me, but,
you know, if you're

08:43.630 --> 08:45.239
desperate I could always...

08:45.240 --> 08:46.579
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:46.580 --> 08:48.809
All we would
have to do is, uh, get

08:48.810 --> 08:50.039
the rights to the photographs.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.669
Well, I don't believe it
would be that difficult.

08:51.670 --> 08:53.749
My point is that
I believe that it

08:53.750 --> 08:57.180
could be extremely commercial,
as well as.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.459
And by the way, I've...

09:02.460 --> 09:05.429
You know, maybe I have
this completely backwards.

09:05.430 --> 09:09.169
Maybe he meant for the two
you to... to move to Brooklyn.

09:09.170 --> 09:10.849
Thank you.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.729
What else did he say?

09:13.730 --> 09:16.219
Have you never
discussed this before?

09:16.220 --> 09:19.089
No, this is a
total first for me.

09:19.090 --> 09:19.789
Nina?

09:19.790 --> 09:20.709
Oh, my god.

09:20.710 --> 09:22.709
Oh!

09:22.710 --> 09:24.509
Nina, this is Stephen Saint.

09:24.510 --> 09:25.869
Hi.

09:25.870 --> 09:27.789
I was asking Constance
all about you.

09:27.790 --> 09:28.549
Hello, George.

09:28.550 --> 09:30.499
You are very fresh and natural.

09:30.500 --> 09:34.109
He is the most fabulous
creative director at Sachi's.

09:34.110 --> 09:34.809
Oh.

09:34.810 --> 09:36.379
And you're a cute shrink.

09:36.380 --> 09:38.239
That's an unbeatable
combination.

09:38.240 --> 09:38.989
Mm-hmm.

09:38.990 --> 09:40.729
My sister likes to
say I'm a shrink.

09:40.730 --> 09:41.769
I'm actually a social worker.

09:41.770 --> 09:42.469
Hi.

09:42.470 --> 09:43.009
Oh, hi.

09:43.010 --> 09:43.879
George, come with me.

09:43.880 --> 09:47.259
I'm having problems
with my centrepiece.

09:47.260 --> 09:48.599
Oh, hey.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.459
Um, I think the work that
you do is fantastic, really.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.009
I think you got
a lot of courage.

09:53.010 --> 09:53.939
George, in the book.

09:53.940 --> 09:55.349
If there's anything I can do.

09:55.350 --> 09:56.379
I'm sorry.

09:56.380 --> 09:58.329
I'm really sorry.

09:58.330 --> 09:59.649
What did she say?

09:59.650 --> 10:01.429
Good night.

10:01.430 --> 10:03.359
You were great!

10:03.360 --> 10:06.099
You were just great!

10:06.100 --> 10:07.009
Oh!

10:07.010 --> 10:08.659
And those women!

10:08.660 --> 10:10.129
My god!

10:10.130 --> 10:13.009
Oh, they were
swarming all over you.

10:13.010 --> 10:15.339
It... well, you were the
centre of attention.

10:15.340 --> 10:21.139
And I, of course, was, uh, stuck
next to that social worker.

10:21.140 --> 10:24.080
Oh, well.

10:34.150 --> 10:35.699
You told her I wanted
to move to Brooklyn.

10:35.700 --> 10:36.399
What?

10:36.400 --> 10:37.309
God damn it, Joley.

10:37.310 --> 10:39.529
You told her I was moving out.

10:39.530 --> 10:42.969
I told her you might be
looking for an apartment.

10:42.970 --> 10:44.999
I wanted to wait till your play
was open to bring any of this

10:45.000 --> 10:45.699
up.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.269
Well, you certainly
didn't waste any time.

10:47.270 --> 10:49.319
George, can we talk about
this when we get home?

10:49.320 --> 10:50.759
This isn't really appropriate.

10:50.760 --> 10:51.679
Really?

10:51.680 --> 10:53.209
But it's entirely
appropriate for me

10:53.210 --> 10:55.639
to hear my relationship is
over from a complete stranger?

10:55.640 --> 10:57.960
Our relationship isn't over.

11:02.740 --> 11:04.940
Who are you
sleeping with, Joley?

11:05.770 --> 11:06.469
Please!

11:06.470 --> 11:12.709
I... that's just... that's
just a little simple.

11:12.710 --> 11:13.879
Yeah, well, I'm a simple guy.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.790
That's why I teach first grade.

11:20.670 --> 11:22.109
George, I'm going
to be 40 this summer.

11:22.110 --> 11:23.009
Oh, god!

11:23.010 --> 11:24.519
But we're both too
young to settle

11:24.520 --> 11:27.289
for a twin bedded friendship.

11:27.290 --> 11:31.479
This hasn't really been
working for a long time.

11:31.480 --> 11:32.960
Who have you got
lined up, Joley?

11:38.300 --> 11:39.979
He's a student of mine.

11:39.980 --> 11:44.709
But I... I don't
know what to say.

11:44.710 --> 11:48.269
Is this student the
reason you missed my play?

11:48.270 --> 11:51.519
He's just breaking up with a
woman and he wanted to talk.

11:51.520 --> 11:54.499
Look, I want to be with him,
but I don't want to hurt you.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.589
George, you're my best friend.

11:55.590 --> 11:56.469
What should I do?

11:56.470 --> 11:58.039
Fuck You, Joley.

11:58.040 --> 11:59.349
And fuck your student.

11:59.350 --> 12:00.490
And fuck our friendship.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.700
I didn't want to tell you
this until you were ready.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.810
I'm a nice man, George.

12:44.290 --> 12:45.280
Great neighbourhood.

12:48.750 --> 12:53.199
Looks very safe here,
a lot of families.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.240
Hey, look, I'll call you.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.089
I can't get Showtime or HBO.

13:15.090 --> 13:18.809
Never mind the Food Network.

13:18.810 --> 13:20.999
I'm here for Nina Borowski.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.420
After you fix her's,
you come and fix mine.

13:29.120 --> 13:29.819
Hi.

13:29.820 --> 13:31.789
Hi.

13:31.790 --> 13:34.399
This is really embarrassing.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.850
Aw, come on in.

13:39.010 --> 13:40.339
I was happy that you called.

13:40.340 --> 13:42.689
I mean, I wasn't happy that
you needed a place to stay,

13:42.690 --> 13:44.619
but still happy that you called.

13:44.620 --> 13:45.349
Come on up.

13:45.350 --> 13:47.569
I'm on the second floor.

13:47.570 --> 13:50.329
Come on in.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.529
Oh, this is great.

13:53.530 --> 13:54.930
All right, let me
show you the room.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.359
Oh, it's nice.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.909
It could use some personality.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.749
Uh, but I... I know somebody
at the Community Centre

14:05.750 --> 14:06.849
who can make some curtains.

14:06.850 --> 14:09.969
Oh, that... this won't
be for a very long.

14:09.970 --> 14:12.239
I can move in with my brother
as soon his current girlfriend

14:12.240 --> 14:13.029
moves out.

14:13.030 --> 14:14.949
No rush.

14:14.950 --> 14:17.010
And, uh, this is the bathroom.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.559
This is my bedroom.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.899
Oh, fuck.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.039
You get a lot of light.

14:25.040 --> 14:25.939
Yeah.

14:25.940 --> 14:27.979
And this is the office.

14:27.980 --> 14:28.889
Oh.

14:28.890 --> 14:31.619
That's it.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.299
It's nice.

14:33.300 --> 14:36.519
Yeah, he's been
engaged seven times.

14:36.520 --> 14:37.709
Wow, really?

14:37.710 --> 14:38.469
Your brother?

14:38.470 --> 14:39.169
Mm-hmm.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.479
Hey, would you like me
to fix you up with him.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.179
Oh, thanks.

14:42.180 --> 14:43.309
The last thing I need.

14:43.310 --> 14:45.369
I've got my hands
full with Vince.

14:45.370 --> 14:46.070
It's ready.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.739
Mind if I ask you something?

14:51.740 --> 14:52.549
Sure.

14:52.550 --> 14:55.029
How come I'm staying
here and he isn't?

14:55.030 --> 14:56.779
Oh, Vince works fine as it is.

14:56.780 --> 14:58.220
Sit down.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.709
Thanks.

15:02.710 --> 15:05.170
You saved my life, really.

15:09.340 --> 15:11.349
No hot water between
2:00 and 7:00.

15:11.350 --> 15:13.599
Did you get your
television fixed Mrs. Sarni?

15:13.600 --> 15:15.090
Why, you would
come over and watch?

15:20.150 --> 15:22.579
So you have the keys, you
have the phone... phone number.

15:22.580 --> 15:24.139
And the buzzer doesn't
work, you know that.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.039
Uh, the Korean deli is across
the street from the subway.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.849
It's open 'til midnight.

15:27.850 --> 15:29.949
Avoid the salad bar.

15:29.950 --> 15:31.009
Toaster is broken.

15:31.010 --> 15:31.809
Use the broiler instead.

15:31.810 --> 15:33.799
The mail comes in the morning.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.089
Don't open the door
for any gas men,

15:35.090 --> 15:36.839
unless you think either
of us would be interested.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.489
This is me.

15:38.490 --> 15:40.189
Well, thanks for everything.

15:40.190 --> 15:40.909
Oh, sure.

15:40.910 --> 15:42.879
The subway is one
block that way.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.859
See you later.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.329
What's happened to Vince?

15:46.330 --> 15:49.289
Nothing has happened to Vince.

15:49.290 --> 15:50.769
What's happened to Joley?

15:50.770 --> 15:51.759
Nothing's happened to Joley.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.089
I tried to call you
there this morning.

15:53.090 --> 15:54.229
He said you've moved.

15:54.230 --> 15:56.339
So we did it on Saturday night.

15:56.340 --> 15:57.089
Ah!

15:57.090 --> 15:57.789
Fantastic!

15:57.790 --> 15:58.899
And was it good?

15:58.900 --> 16:02.799
It was OK, until on Sunday
I saw him with another girl.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.499
What a moron!

16:03.500 --> 16:05.879
Ain't that... what did I say.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.699
Keesha, Keesha, I like sex.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.229
And I like boys a lot.

16:11.230 --> 16:15.139
But I am not about to waste my
time with some guy who doesn't

16:15.140 --> 16:17.179
see things the way that I do.

16:17.180 --> 16:20.659
I mean, do you
really need this guy?

16:20.660 --> 16:22.089
This is the Earth.

16:22.090 --> 16:24.219
And this tack, that's
us, right here.

16:24.220 --> 16:26.219
And the lamp is the sun.

16:26.220 --> 16:27.779
So why does it get dark?

16:27.780 --> 16:31.209
The Earth spins.

16:31.210 --> 16:32.179
Very good.

16:32.180 --> 16:33.539
Because the Earth spins.

16:33.540 --> 16:35.479
And how do we know that?

16:35.480 --> 16:36.180
Copernicus.

16:40.620 --> 16:43.579
Nina?

16:43.580 --> 16:45.579
Nina, is that you?

16:45.580 --> 16:46.279
Hey!

16:46.280 --> 16:47.299
George, how are you?

16:47.300 --> 16:48.039
Vince McBride.

16:48.040 --> 16:48.739
You know what?

16:48.740 --> 16:50.219
Nina has told me all about you.

16:50.220 --> 16:50.969
Nice to meet you.

16:50.970 --> 16:51.939
Yeah, glad your here, buddy.

16:51.940 --> 16:53.589
You know, I feel better
knowing somebody is

16:53.590 --> 16:55.259
keeping an eye out for my girl.

16:55.260 --> 16:56.379
Hey.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.579
Vince, meet George.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.069
Actually, we're
old friends already.

16:59.070 --> 17:00.859
Hey, George, join
us for a cup of tea?

17:00.860 --> 17:02.689
You know, you don't have
to put on a robe for me.

17:02.690 --> 17:03.389
Yeah.

17:03.390 --> 17:03.810
No.

17:03.811 --> 17:04.979
In fact, George,
you could probably

17:04.980 --> 17:08.559
take off all of your clothes and
I don't think Vince would mind.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.858
She's eating me alive.

17:09.859 --> 17:12.128
I dote on her, and
she's eating me alive.

17:12.130 --> 17:13.118
Oh, OK.

17:13.119 --> 17:16.549
See, aren't you glad you
settled down with us?

17:16.550 --> 17:18.309
I was maybe going
to be a teacher once.

17:18.310 --> 17:20.108
You know, get 'em
while their young.

17:20.109 --> 17:22.138
Teach them they don't have to
believe that somebody else's is

17:22.140 --> 17:22.868
holding all the cards.

17:22.869 --> 17:23.969
You know what I'm
saying, George?

17:23.970 --> 17:24.878
He knows, Vince.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.739
No, he knows and
he doesn't know.

17:27.740 --> 17:30.479
How come you don't teach
at a public school, George?

17:30.480 --> 17:32.309
I got a job at the
Brinkley School.

17:32.310 --> 17:33.859
But you're a gay guy.

17:33.860 --> 17:35.809
Shouldn't you be sticking
up for the disenfranchised?

17:35.810 --> 17:37.469
Can we talk about
the movie, please?

17:37.470 --> 17:38.229
No, now wait a minute.

17:38.230 --> 17:40.859
Uh, you mind if I ask
how much you get paid?

17:40.860 --> 17:43.559
You make more than
four figures, right?

17:43.560 --> 17:45.639
In the very early five figures.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.769
Oh, Christ almighty.

17:47.770 --> 17:49.789
And their all
fucking millionaires.

17:49.790 --> 17:51.149
You know, they... they
couldn't eat lunch

17:51.150 --> 17:53.049
on what they're paying you.

17:53.050 --> 17:55.079
You know, you got to organise
the teachers, George.

17:55.080 --> 17:55.889
I'll help you.

17:55.890 --> 17:56.789
You're all getting screwed.

17:56.790 --> 17:57.829
You know that, don't you?

17:57.830 --> 17:59.299
Well, thanks.

17:59.300 --> 18:02.249
That's... that's
all great advice.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.229
But I'm afraid I
have school tomorrow,

18:05.230 --> 18:08.189
so it's great to meet you.

18:08.190 --> 18:09.179
You too.

18:09.180 --> 18:10.149
Good night, George.

18:10.150 --> 18:11.119
Good night.

18:11.120 --> 18:11.960
Night, George.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.309
Oh, you terrorised him.

18:18.310 --> 18:19.369
What are talking about?

18:19.370 --> 18:21.039
We were having a
nice conversation.

18:21.040 --> 18:24.399
You told him he had the wrong
job and he made no money.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.099
No, no, no.

18:25.100 --> 18:25.859
You weren't listening.

18:25.860 --> 18:28.029
I told him he had the right
job in the wrong place

18:28.030 --> 18:29.399
and made no money.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.229
You don't even know him.

18:31.230 --> 18:32.779
That never stopped me before.

18:32.780 --> 18:34.069
Oh, my stepsister is right.

18:34.070 --> 18:36.719
You are just a bulldozer.

18:36.720 --> 18:37.929
What are you talking about?

18:37.930 --> 18:38.979
I'm a pussy cat.

18:38.980 --> 18:41.029
Well, did I get angry with
you when you let a gay guy

18:41.030 --> 18:42.379
move in here instead of me?

18:42.380 --> 18:43.079
No.

18:43.080 --> 18:43.769
No.

18:43.770 --> 18:44.659
I like him.

18:44.660 --> 18:46.469
Vince, you don't
have to like him.

18:46.470 --> 18:48.169
But there is one thing.

18:48.170 --> 18:51.289
How come it's OK for him to
live on top of you and not me?

18:51.290 --> 18:52.789
He's not living on top of me.

18:52.790 --> 18:54.159
And he's leaving in two weeks.

18:54.160 --> 18:54.859
No, no, no.

18:54.860 --> 18:55.849
He's never going anywhere.

18:55.850 --> 18:57.879
He's gonna fall in love
with you and turn straight.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.319
Oh!

18:59.320 --> 19:00.819
You're crazy.

19:00.820 --> 19:05.009
Naw, not if you're looking
at what I'm looking at.

19:05.010 --> 19:06.289
Vince.

19:06.290 --> 19:07.489
What?

19:07.490 --> 19:08.190
Get in here.

19:21.540 --> 19:22.919
Hi.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.409
Hey.

19:25.410 --> 19:28.489
Late night comfort
food, bad habit.

19:28.490 --> 19:30.300
Shh, shh. Vince is asleep.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.979
He's really very kind.

19:35.980 --> 19:38.759
He just felt threatened by you.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.019
That's insane.

19:40.020 --> 19:42.629
No it isn't.

19:42.630 --> 19:44.440
He asked me the
same thing you did.

19:47.230 --> 19:49.479
Why am I living
here and he isn't?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.269
Bingo.

19:51.270 --> 19:53.010
Maybe you should
be the counsellor.

19:56.700 --> 19:57.760
Do you love him?

20:00.220 --> 20:00.920
Yeah.

20:03.450 --> 20:05.689
Whatever that means.

20:05.690 --> 20:08.709
Just don't know if I
should be living with him.

20:08.710 --> 20:11.719
Vince can really fill a room.

20:11.720 --> 20:12.780
Did you love Joley?

20:16.010 --> 20:17.000
Well, who knows?

20:20.970 --> 20:23.639
I thought... I thought so.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.599
Oh, god.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.069
George, I'm sorry.

20:28.070 --> 20:33.989
Aw, it's... it's so stupid that,
uh, he and I... I don't know.

20:33.990 --> 20:35.659
He's an evasive prick.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.159
I keep thinking I should
have seen it coming.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.889
No.

20:38.890 --> 20:39.749
No.

20:39.750 --> 20:42.869
You did nothing wrong.

20:42.870 --> 20:46.319
You... you just trusted him.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.619
But you wouldn't
have let this happen.

20:47.620 --> 20:48.399
Oh, yeah.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.359
Sure.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.629
I don't trust
anybody, particularly

20:52.630 --> 20:56.619
not amusing, good-looking,
intelligent guys like Joley.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.019
And he has great taste.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.789
Mm.

20:59.790 --> 21:02.349
Aw, he doesn't have
such great taste.

21:02.350 --> 21:03.710
Otherwise he'd
still be with you.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.679
Thank you.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.380
Hm.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.309
We should go dancing.

21:21.310 --> 21:22.169
What?

21:22.170 --> 21:24.649
The Community Centre
on Friday nights.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.359
I'm signing us up.

21:26.360 --> 21:30.969
You must think of every dance
as a three minutes love affair.

21:30.970 --> 21:32.599
Boy meets girl.

21:32.600 --> 21:37.309
They fall in love with
the music, and this dance,

21:37.310 --> 21:39.599
and the orchestra.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.860
And then, they must part.

21:50.860 --> 21:53.289
I... I have no idea
what I'm doing.

21:53.290 --> 21:55.229
I'm... I can't dance.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.909
I can't even dah-nce.

21:56.910 --> 21:58.539
Just smile.

21:58.540 --> 22:00.959
On the balls of your feet.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.369
You're a butterfly.

22:03.370 --> 22:05.309
Does that mean left or right?

22:05.310 --> 22:06.269
Hair up, young people.

22:06.270 --> 22:09.649
Please, hair up.

22:09.650 --> 22:10.619
Head up, young person.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.089
Head up.

22:12.090 --> 22:13.199
I'm gonna fix you up.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.259
That's what Kennedy
and I have decided.

22:15.260 --> 22:16.699
After all, what
are brothers for?

22:16.700 --> 22:17.769
I'm healing.

22:17.770 --> 22:18.829
You're avoiding.

22:18.830 --> 22:21.439
Whenever I call, you're
at home, or you're

22:21.440 --> 22:23.659
doing mambo with your landlady.

22:23.660 --> 22:24.809
It's not healthy.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.819
You've got to get
back out there again.

22:26.820 --> 22:28.009
Don't you think so, sweetie?

22:28.010 --> 22:29.039
Absolutely.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.639
Honey, I've got to get
back to the magazine.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.569
It was nice meeting you.

22:31.570 --> 22:32.269
Yeah.

22:32.270 --> 22:33.459
You too.

22:33.460 --> 22:34.399
So, uh, man.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.559
What do you think, huh?

22:35.560 --> 22:36.689
Thumbs up, thumbs down?

22:36.690 --> 22:38.109
She seems nice.

22:38.110 --> 22:39.849
I'm gonna fix you up.

22:39.850 --> 22:41.609
I don't want to be fixed up.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.449
I have a very nice boyfriend.

22:43.450 --> 22:44.440
He's a Bolshevik.

22:45.230 --> 22:46.559
And anyway, it's
not going anywhere.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.289
Why does it have
to go anywhere?

22:48.290 --> 22:50.489
Because, at some point you
have to take care of yourself.

22:50.490 --> 22:52.639
I am taking care of myself.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.849
I just don't need the
things that you do.

22:55.850 --> 22:57.179
You've got to meet this guy.

22:57.180 --> 22:58.909
What guy?

22:58.910 --> 23:02.439
He's an ear, nose,
and throat man.

23:02.440 --> 23:05.049
He was just on the cover
of "New York Magazine."

23:05.050 --> 23:06.749
George, at some point you're
going to have to start

23:06.750 --> 23:07.779
taking care of yourself.

23:07.780 --> 23:09.739
I'm taking care of myself.

23:09.740 --> 23:10.799
Listen to me.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.940
He's an ear, nose,
and throat man.

23:15.930 --> 23:17.929
But there's nothing
wrong with me.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.059
I don't even have a cold.

23:20.060 --> 23:23.799
Y... lo... I have nothing
in common with this guy.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.739
Just have a cup
of coffee with him.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.790
I promise you, this
is quality goods.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.449
Uh... uh, George Hanson?

23:40.450 --> 23:41.149
Yeah.

23:41.150 --> 23:44.429
Well, I... I'm
Jonathan Goldstein.

23:44.430 --> 23:45.129
You're adorable.

23:45.130 --> 23:48.759
I mean, your bother is cute, but
you're... you're irresistible.

23:48.760 --> 23:53.019
Uh, did anybody ever tell
you, you look like a peach?

23:53.020 --> 23:54.789
No.

23:54.790 --> 23:56.839
So you're an ear,
nose, and throat man?

23:56.840 --> 23:58.509
Well, that's my, uh, you
know, professional life.

23:58.510 --> 23:59.210
Mm-hmm.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.989
I have other interests that
go below the upper torso.

24:03.990 --> 24:04.819
Ha, ha, ha.

24:04.820 --> 24:09.059
That's... say, so I heard you
were on the cover of, uh,

24:09.060 --> 24:10.329
the "New York Magazine?"

24:10.330 --> 24:11.509
Mm.

24:11.510 --> 24:12.209
Uck.

24:12.210 --> 24:17.319
I got 3,000 new patients,
6,000 marriage proposals,

24:17.320 --> 24:18.920
and not a single real date.

24:21.550 --> 24:22.359
You want another drink?

24:22.360 --> 24:23.589
Yeah.

24:23.590 --> 24:24.779
Do you think he's all right?

24:24.780 --> 24:25.479
Who?

24:25.480 --> 24:26.249
George.

24:26.250 --> 24:27.369
He hasn't been a
date in a while,

24:27.370 --> 24:29.729
and people can be really creepy.

24:29.730 --> 24:30.909
Just put your zip
code right there.

24:30.910 --> 24:34.500
Oh, Nina, he's dating
a famous doctor.

24:36.150 --> 24:37.829
What do we do if
he brings him home?

24:37.830 --> 24:39.619
Well, we'll be
happy in our room.

24:39.620 --> 24:41.439
And they'll be
busy in their room.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.799
Sounds very active.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.549
Mr. Shapiro, you're all done.

24:44.550 --> 24:45.729
Can I touch your nose?

24:45.730 --> 24:47.119
It's like a tulip.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.779
Mr. Shapiro,
I have to warn you.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.769
This woman has a
gay roommate who

24:50.770 --> 24:53.439
shows no signs of moving out.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.189
Big deal.

24:54.190 --> 24:55.619
Everyone's gay now.

24:55.620 --> 24:58.239
Ah, you tell him, Mr. Shapiro.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.100
Gay?

25:09.020 --> 25:09.899
Oh.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.819
Her... her... her
daughter's a lesbian.

25:11.820 --> 25:12.949
And she's very proud.

25:12.950 --> 25:14.110
There you go.

25:19.940 --> 25:22.049
Mrs. Ochoa is the
president of New York.

25:22.050 --> 25:23.319
Mothers of Latino Lesbians.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.019
Well!

25:24.020 --> 25:25.149
Good for you.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.849
You're a good mother.

25:26.850 --> 25:28.469
We are here.

25:28.470 --> 25:29.949
Get used to it.

25:29.950 --> 25:31.619
Don't fuck with us.

25:31.620 --> 25:35.059
See, Mr. Shapiro, my problem
is, I love this woman.

25:35.060 --> 25:36.629
And I want to live with her.

25:36.630 --> 25:37.789
Do you make a living?

25:37.790 --> 25:38.759
Sure, I'm a lawyer.

25:38.760 --> 25:39.949
Ah!

25:39.950 --> 25:41.909
Lawyers are the worst people.

25:41.910 --> 25:43.109
Marry me, honey.

25:43.110 --> 25:44.520
I was in children's footwear.

25:50.020 --> 25:51.889
Hello?

25:51.890 --> 25:54.659
Hello.

25:54.660 --> 25:56.129
You there?

25:56.130 --> 25:57.100
I'm here.

26:04.420 --> 26:05.889
Ha.

26:05.890 --> 26:07.369
Hey.

26:07.370 --> 26:09.679
Hey.

26:09.680 --> 26:12.679
Where's Dr. Goldstein?

26:12.680 --> 26:16.209
I don't know, home.

26:16.210 --> 26:17.329
I thought maybe, um...

26:17.330 --> 26:19.659
Yeah, I thought maybe not.

26:19.660 --> 26:24.200
Oh, um, remind me to never
go on another blind date.

26:25.530 --> 26:27.159
You don't have to.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.769
Just say no.

26:30.770 --> 26:33.039
Good night.

26:33.040 --> 26:33.740
Good night.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.149
Step, step.

27:12.150 --> 27:12.929
Quick, quick.

27:12.930 --> 27:13.629
Step, step.

27:13.630 --> 27:14.609
Quick, quick.

27:14.610 --> 27:15.599
Slow, slow.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.519
Quick, quick.

27:16.520 --> 27:17.229
Slow, slow.

27:17.230 --> 27:18.559
Quick, very good.

27:18.560 --> 27:19.529
Very good.

27:19.530 --> 27:20.389
Yeah.

27:20.390 --> 27:22.379
Very nice, Sylvia.

27:22.380 --> 27:23.179
Excellent.

27:23.180 --> 27:23.869
Much better.

27:23.870 --> 27:25.670
Very good.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.359
No, no, no, no, no.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.849
Head up, young person.

27:29.850 --> 27:30.849
Head up.

27:30.850 --> 27:31.839
Please, excuse us.

27:31.840 --> 27:32.639
Sure.

27:32.640 --> 27:33.339
Hello, Nina.

27:33.340 --> 27:34.669
Oh, hi, Danny.

27:34.670 --> 27:37.110
You're... whoop.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.549
Help!

27:39.550 --> 27:40.529
Look at me.

27:40.530 --> 27:41.289
No, no, no, no.

27:41.290 --> 27:41.989
Please.

27:41.990 --> 27:42.689
Stop it.

27:42.690 --> 27:43.449
Danny, come on.

27:43.450 --> 27:45.410
Just stop touching...
Madame Reynolds!

27:55.550 --> 28:02.030
T-A-N-G-O. T-A-N-G-O. Woo!

28:12.980 --> 28:13.979
Oh!

28:13.980 --> 28:17.959
Oh, no, no, no.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.959
Please get up young people.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.449
Get up.

28:21.450 --> 28:24.439
Now one, two, side step.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.429
One, two, side step.

28:26.430 --> 28:27.229
Glide.

28:27.230 --> 28:27.919
Glide.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.920
Glide, Betty.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.899
Smile, Mrs. Wilson.

28:33.900 --> 28:35.890
Let the music carry you away.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.349
Yes!

28:46.350 --> 28:47.349
Quick, quick steps.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.339
And quick, quick steps.

28:49.340 --> 28:51.129
And quick, quick steps.

28:51.130 --> 28:51.829
Good job.

28:51.830 --> 28:53.819
Thank you, well done!

28:53.820 --> 28:55.309
Well done!

28:55.310 --> 28:57.309
Watch them.

28:57.310 --> 29:01.089
They are an example
for all of you.

29:01.090 --> 29:01.790
Bravo!

29:41.310 --> 29:43.839
Oh, he's so sexy.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.839
Who, Gene Kelly?

29:45.840 --> 29:47.689
Mm, yeah.

29:47.690 --> 29:50.459
Not my type, at all.

29:50.460 --> 29:52.119
What is your type?

29:52.120 --> 29:53.929
Well, it varies.

29:53.930 --> 29:55.729
It depends.

29:55.730 --> 29:57.409
Who was the first person
you ever slept with?

29:57.410 --> 29:58.359
What is this? 20 Questions?

29:58.360 --> 29:59.059
What?

29:59.060 --> 30:00.979
I want to know.

30:00.980 --> 30:01.820
Lucy Jane Parnell.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.189
What?

30:06.190 --> 30:06.969
Mm.

30:06.970 --> 30:08.319
Belmore High School prom night.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.500
Gave her a real good time.

30:13.970 --> 30:16.139
You slept with a girl?

30:16.140 --> 30:16.839
Yeah.

30:16.840 --> 30:20.979
Well, Lucy was my high
school girlfriend.

30:20.980 --> 30:22.090
What... what happened?

30:25.640 --> 30:28.549
Well, I, uh, went to college.

30:28.550 --> 30:32.509
And I found myself lusting
after the football team

30:32.510 --> 30:33.429
more than the cheerleaders.

30:33.430 --> 30:38.889
So I kind of figured I was gay.

30:38.890 --> 30:41.489
What happened to Lucy Jane?

30:41.490 --> 30:43.959
Well, I... I guess
she got married.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.629
You know, or she runs
an insurance company.

30:46.630 --> 30:47.329
I have no idea.

30:47.330 --> 30:52.599
I don't... but she was nice.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.859
Mm.

30:53.860 --> 30:55.479
And an unbelievable dancer.

30:55.480 --> 30:59.040
My god, could Lucy
tear up the floor.

31:01.910 --> 31:03.729
Was she pretty?

31:03.730 --> 31:05.889
Yeah.

31:05.890 --> 31:11.799
She had these big eyes and
this pouty little mouth.

31:11.800 --> 31:17.039
And her nose, it was
just like a tulip.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.349
I just wanted to touch it.

31:19.350 --> 31:21.879
It was the most fresh and
natural looking nose...

31:21.880 --> 31:22.569
Stop it!

31:22.570 --> 31:24.329
Fuck you, George!

31:24.330 --> 31:25.029
Fuck you.

31:25.030 --> 31:25.979
I just wanted to touch it.

31:25.980 --> 31:26.679
Stop it!

31:26.680 --> 31:27.959
No, don't do it!

31:27.960 --> 31:28.659
No, no.

31:28.660 --> 31:30.629
Don't start tickling.

31:30.630 --> 31:31.419
Aah!

31:31.420 --> 31:32.119
Aah!

31:32.120 --> 31:33.399
Yesterday, we studied Easter.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.749
And today, we're going to learn
about the Jewish holiday called.

31:35.750 --> 31:37.139
Passover.

31:37.140 --> 31:38.949
My father's Jewish and
my mother's Buddhist.

31:38.950 --> 31:39.859
But.

31:39.860 --> 31:40.559
All right.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.319
My mother's Episcopal, and her
boyfriend's ethical culture.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.019
Wow.

31:44.020 --> 31:46.339
Both of my parents
are Lutheran.

31:46.340 --> 31:47.309
So what?

31:47.310 --> 31:49.249
Both of my parents are reformed.

31:49.250 --> 31:53.129
My mother is AA and
my father is Christian.

31:53.130 --> 31:55.339
My dad is Muslim
and my mom's a atheist.

31:55.340 --> 31:56.100
I'll be right back.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.400
When did you find out?

32:01.370 --> 32:04.659
About an hour ago.

32:04.660 --> 32:06.629
I don't know what to do.

32:06.630 --> 32:08.219
Tell me what to do.

32:08.220 --> 32:10.169
I can't.

32:10.170 --> 32:12.469
Maybe you should talk to Vince.

32:12.470 --> 32:13.519
He is the father.

32:13.520 --> 32:14.739
Yeah, Vince.

32:14.740 --> 32:16.949
Vince believes in a
woman's right to choose, as

32:16.950 --> 32:20.199
long as he does the choosing.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.969
No.

32:21.970 --> 32:26.449
I can't talk to Vince until I
figure out what I want to do.

32:26.450 --> 32:28.950
I just need some time to think.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.080
Well, I'm here for you, Nina.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.199
Whatever you need
for me to do, I will.

32:42.200 --> 32:42.900
Oh!

32:49.140 --> 32:50.509
She hasn't spoken
to me in three weeks.

32:50.510 --> 32:51.589
It's not personal.

32:51.590 --> 32:52.679
She's been busy.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.279
Is she seeing somebody else?

32:54.280 --> 32:54.979
Huh?

32:54.980 --> 32:55.569
No, no, no.

32:55.570 --> 32:56.269
What?

32:56.270 --> 32:57.539
She's a very beautiful girl.

32:57.540 --> 32:59.669
There's men hitting
on her all the time.

32:59.670 --> 33:02.659
There's no one else, Vince.

33:02.660 --> 33:05.559
So you... you two still
spend a lot of time together.

33:05.560 --> 33:06.260
Right?

33:10.500 --> 33:12.020
What sort of things
do you do together?

33:15.260 --> 33:16.649
Well, we talk.

33:16.650 --> 33:18.709
You know, we go to the movies.

33:18.710 --> 33:20.069
Sometimes we go dancing.

33:20.070 --> 33:22.059
Regular stuff.

33:22.060 --> 33:23.549
You go dancing.

33:23.550 --> 33:25.819
Then what?

33:25.820 --> 33:27.940
Then we go home, we get into
bed and watch television.

33:32.470 --> 33:34.239
But you're not a
threat to her, huh?

33:34.240 --> 33:35.429
Is that the attraction?

33:35.430 --> 33:36.569
I'm not su... I don't know.

33:36.570 --> 33:39.039
Now, you know
what I mean, George.

33:39.040 --> 33:42.059
You're not offering her
anything more than friendship?

33:42.060 --> 33:44.789
Of course I'm not offering her
anything more than friendship.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.230
Come on, guys!

33:53.430 --> 33:56.349
I made up my mind.

33:56.350 --> 33:58.380
I'll take you wherever
you want to go.

34:02.840 --> 34:08.779
George, I'm going
to have this baby.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.319
You are?

34:10.320 --> 34:11.020
Yeah.

34:18.159 --> 34:19.020
That's great.

34:21.909 --> 34:25.379
You're going to be
a wonderful mother.

34:25.380 --> 34:26.300
Lucky baby.

34:29.090 --> 34:30.619
And, Nina, you are
going to make Vince.

34:30.620 --> 34:32.510
McBride the happiest man alive.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.480
This is so great!

34:39.330 --> 34:41.539
I get to be in charge of
all musical education.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.260
OK, tell Vince I get
to pick all the songs.

34:46.170 --> 34:46.899
This great.

34:46.900 --> 34:49.929
This is so great!

34:49.929 --> 34:50.889
Good decision.

34:50.889 --> 34:54.380
George, could we go celebrate?

35:10.350 --> 35:14.639
George, would you consider
raising this baby with me?

35:14.640 --> 35:15.340
Of course.

35:18.330 --> 35:20.829
I'll be Uncle George.

35:20.830 --> 35:24.149
You're never going
to get rid of me.

35:24.150 --> 35:26.069
Actually, I was
thinking we should keep

35:26.070 --> 35:31.079
living together, like a family.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.779
What about Vince?

35:32.780 --> 35:33.949
Well, he's the father.

35:33.950 --> 35:35.779
I mean, there's no
question about that.

35:35.780 --> 35:39.279
He'll always be
in my baby's life.

35:39.280 --> 35:42.219
But he's not home to me.

35:42.220 --> 35:42.920
You are.

35:46.350 --> 35:50.229
You can't do that to Vince.

35:50.230 --> 35:54.889
George, my father married
somebody wrong, because he

35:54.890 --> 35:57.219
thought it was good for me.

35:57.220 --> 35:58.699
I can't do that to my kid.

35:58.700 --> 36:03.569
I... me and Vince and the
baby... it's a bad equation.

36:03.570 --> 36:05.009
Jesus Christ, Nina.

36:05.010 --> 36:07.329
Vince is the father.

36:07.330 --> 36:09.439
You should be with the
father of your child.

36:09.440 --> 36:13.319
Don't you see how
exciting this could be?

36:13.320 --> 36:14.719
You love children.

36:14.720 --> 36:17.009
You could raise a child.

36:17.010 --> 36:18.999
I don't want to marry Vince.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.489
I don't have to marry Vince.

36:21.490 --> 36:22.980
And I don't want to marry you.

36:28.940 --> 36:33.439
George, I'm not
proposing marriage.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.739
We can make this
up for ourselves.

36:35.740 --> 36:39.459
None of the old rules apply.

36:39.460 --> 36:41.879
It's getting late.

36:41.880 --> 36:42.870
We should go.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.810
Won't you even think about it?

36:51.270 --> 36:53.239
Sure.

36:53.240 --> 36:58.680
Hey, I'm very, you know?

37:11.550 --> 37:12.329
Hello.

37:12.330 --> 37:13.379
Nina, darling.

37:13.380 --> 37:14.109
Yeah?

37:14.110 --> 37:15.239
We're Right around the corner.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.139
Oh, great.

37:16.140 --> 37:16.480
Yeah.

37:16.481 --> 37:18.669
We've been to brunch at Norman
Mailer's in Brooklyn Heights.

37:18.670 --> 37:19.100
Oh.

37:19.100 --> 37:19.360
You can go as soon
as we get there.

37:19.360 --> 37:19.730
Yeah.

37:19.731 --> 37:20.999
So I thought we'd
swing by and say hi.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.479
- I have to to go real bad.
- We're almost there.

37:22.480 --> 37:22.920
Yeah, we'll right over.

37:22.921 --> 37:24.199
We're almost
there, don't worry.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.169
She's thrilled.

37:25.170 --> 37:26.059
Fuck!

37:26.060 --> 37:28.450
It's Constance.

37:30.280 --> 37:33.169
That can't be them already.

37:33.170 --> 37:34.319
Hey.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.349
Unbelievable.

37:36.350 --> 37:37.049
Oh, Vince.

37:37.050 --> 37:38.389
You should have called.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.299
Aw, what good would
that have done me?

37:40.300 --> 37:42.089
Sidney and Constance
are coming over.

37:42.090 --> 37:42.789
Terrific.

37:42.790 --> 37:43.959
I got plenty of
food for everybody.

37:43.960 --> 37:45.209
Is George still here too?

37:45.210 --> 37:45.989
Yes, he's here.

37:45.990 --> 37:46.689
Oh, good.

37:46.690 --> 37:48.069
So the whole gang's
together again.

37:48.070 --> 37:49.649
It'll be just like old times.

37:49.650 --> 37:50.349
Hey, you look thin.

37:50.350 --> 37:51.369
I'm fine.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.189
We need to talk.

37:52.190 --> 37:53.659
We're talking.

37:53.660 --> 37:54.549
Some more bread.

37:54.550 --> 37:57.419
We got the salami, the
prosciutto that you

37:57.420 --> 37:59.579
love so much, the cheese.

37:59.580 --> 38:00.839
We got some herring.

38:00.840 --> 38:04.789
And we have some deliciously
fresh mozzarella.

38:04.790 --> 38:07.139
Vince, how many people
were you expecting?

38:07.140 --> 38:08.669
Uh, I thought maybe
some more people

38:08.670 --> 38:09.919
moved into the spare room.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.709
You know, I don't know
what goes on here, George.

38:11.710 --> 38:13.119
She doesn't even talk to me.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.539
You got any more plates?

38:14.540 --> 38:16.390
Look, why are Constance
and Sidney coming?

38:17.710 --> 38:18.409
I'll get it.

38:18.410 --> 38:19.219
George!

38:19.220 --> 38:20.559
Hey, it's the sea witch.

38:20.560 --> 38:21.609
- Excuse me.
- Can I go the bathroom?

38:21.610 --> 38:22.789
Is there a party
going on upstairs?

38:22.790 --> 38:23.489
No, no.

38:23.490 --> 38:24.359
We're going to see Nina.

38:24.360 --> 38:25.129
You know Nina.

38:25.130 --> 38:26.319
George, is there a party?

38:26.320 --> 38:27.539
Come on, tell me.
Is there a party up there?

38:27.540 --> 38:28.389
No, there's no party.

38:28.390 --> 38:29.519
Did you tell these
guests there's

38:29.520 --> 38:30.779
no hot water after 8:00 PM?

38:30.780 --> 38:31.150
Thank you.

38:31.151 --> 38:32.109
I can't afford these bills.

38:32.110 --> 38:32.829
- Thank you, Mrs. Sarni.
- Thank you very much.

38:32.830 --> 38:33.719
- I'm a widow woman.
- She's terrific.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.189
Who needs a doorman when
you have Mrs. Sarni?

38:36.190 --> 38:38.169
Just hurry up and get inside.

38:38.170 --> 38:40.519
You know, I really envy you
your living here, George.

38:40.520 --> 38:41.219
Really?

38:41.220 --> 38:41.759
- Sure.
- Everybody, will you stop.

38:41.760 --> 38:42.230
Sure, what do you need with a...
Talking?

38:42.231 --> 38:43.329
Dining room, butler's pantry?

38:43.330 --> 38:44.809
- I really have to go.
- Dinner parties.

38:44.810 --> 38:45.609
It's all a big headache.

38:45.610 --> 38:46.569
I want to go now!

38:46.570 --> 38:48.949
Bill Styron lived in a
place just like this when he

38:48.950 --> 38:50.049
thought of "Sophie's Choice."

38:50.050 --> 38:51.879
Sidney, what the hell
are you talking about?

38:51.880 --> 38:52.230
Hi.

38:52.231 --> 38:53.369
God, it's hot.
It's like August all ready.

38:53.370 --> 38:54.209
You've been avoiding me.

38:54.210 --> 38:55.049
Oh, no.

38:55.050 --> 38:55.749
Hiya, sugar.

38:55.750 --> 38:56.519
How are you?

38:56.520 --> 38:56.910
Hi.

38:56.911 --> 38:58.239
How do you get
through a whole summer

38:58.240 --> 38:59.599
without air
conditioning in here?

38:59.600 --> 39:00.299
Hey!

39:00.300 --> 39:00.590
Vinnie!

39:00.591 --> 39:01.289
Hey, Sidney.

39:01.290 --> 39:02.019
It's good to see you.

39:02.020 --> 39:02.799
Come eat, huh?

39:02.800 --> 39:03.539
Ooh, this looks good.

39:03.540 --> 39:04.669
Are you having a party?

39:04.670 --> 39:05.709
So, who you defending now?

39:05.710 --> 39:08.069
Ah, a couple of kids who got
framed on a rape and battery

39:08.070 --> 39:09.049
charge in the Bronx.

39:09.050 --> 39:10.139
Let me tell you something.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.819
You defend somebody
really big, doesn't matter

39:12.820 --> 39:14.509
whether you win or lose,
I'll get you $2 million

39:14.510 --> 39:15.769
on the book deal.

39:15.770 --> 39:18.069
And by the way, you don't
even have to write it.

39:18.070 --> 39:20.249
Ha, I'm not in show
business, Sidney.

39:20.250 --> 39:21.419
Most people in
your business don't

39:21.420 --> 39:23.069
seem averse to a little
publicity, Vincent.

39:23.070 --> 39:24.349
You should think
about "Court TV."

39:24.350 --> 39:25.779
He doesn't want to
think about "Court TV."

39:25.780 --> 39:26.839
This food is wonderful.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.039
Did you get this food, George?

39:28.040 --> 39:29.219
I could eat like this every day.

39:29.220 --> 39:30.459
Sidney, give me
that herring or I'll

39:30.460 --> 39:31.049
be hearing about it all night.
What do mean?

39:31.050 --> 39:31.180
What is it?

39:31.181 --> 39:32.709
What will you be
hearing all night?

39:32.710 --> 39:33.939
Sally, go wash your hands.

39:33.940 --> 39:35.549
But there's no
hot water after 8:00 PM.

39:35.550 --> 39:35.870
Nina, where have you been?
Well, it's only 3:30.

39:35.871 --> 39:36.729
Nina, where have you been? Well, it's only 3:30.
Well, it's only 3:30. Oh, that's interesting.

39:36.730 --> 39:37.249
- Well, it's only 3:30.
- Oh, that's interesting.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.989
So you haven't been
calling Constance either?

39:38.990 --> 39:41.199
How do you survive without
her excellent advice?

39:41.200 --> 39:42.259
Excuse me, Vincent.

39:42.260 --> 39:43.609
She talks to me every day.

39:43.610 --> 39:44.359
We're very close.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.529
I swear, I'm hotter
than a goat in China.

39:46.530 --> 39:47.829
I'm not feeling right.

39:47.830 --> 39:48.879
Can we get some air in here?

39:48.880 --> 39:49.579
All right.

39:49.580 --> 39:50.759
Why are you hiding
from us, Nina?

39:50.760 --> 39:52.169
Did you finally
break up with him?

39:52.170 --> 39:53.559
I'm so proud of you.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.029
Come on, nobody had
broken up with me.

39:55.030 --> 39:56.419
Why don't you mind
your own business?

39:56.420 --> 39:57.849
Sweetie, do you think
it's possible to get

39:57.850 --> 39:58.939
food poisoning this fast?

39:58.940 --> 40:00.099
Do you have any
air conditioning?

40:00.100 --> 40:00.839
I will get the fan.

40:00.840 --> 40:01.909
Hey, whoa. Wait a minute.

40:01.910 --> 40:03.699
No you shouldn't be
lifting stuff like that.

40:03.700 --> 40:05.889
Why not?

40:05.890 --> 40:07.719
I'm fine.

40:07.720 --> 40:11.319
Nothing is wrong with me.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.889
George, what the
fuck is going on here?

40:12.890 --> 40:14.919
Don't you dare speak that
way in front of my child.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.779
Betty, I think it's
time we got home.

40:16.780 --> 40:18.539
Betty was your other wife.

40:18.540 --> 40:20.849
I'm Constance, remember?

40:20.850 --> 40:21.809
Oh, Christ.

40:21.810 --> 40:22.829
Are you sleeping with her?

40:22.830 --> 40:23.999
Vince, I'm gay.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.739
You are?

40:25.740 --> 40:28.229
And it's a valid
and wonderful choice.

40:28.230 --> 40:29.609
Sidney, shut up.

40:29.610 --> 40:32.059
George, what is going on here?

40:32.060 --> 40:32.849
Give it me, come on.

40:32.850 --> 40:33.579
Come on.

40:33.580 --> 40:34.660
Are you pregnant?

40:36.660 --> 40:38.909
Oh my god, you're pregnant.

40:38.910 --> 40:39.809
George!

40:39.810 --> 40:40.699
George!

40:40.700 --> 40:42.049
What's going on?

40:42.050 --> 40:43.249
Who's the father?

40:43.250 --> 40:44.419
I knew it, you son of a bitch.

40:44.420 --> 40:45.119
I knew You.

40:45.120 --> 40:46.289
Couldn't keep your
hand off of her.

40:46.290 --> 40:46.989
Vince, Vince.

40:46.990 --> 40:47.849
Calm down.

40:47.850 --> 40:48.589
It's your baby.

40:48.590 --> 40:50.899
I want New York
Hospital, Emergency Room.

40:50.900 --> 40:52.219
It's... it's mine?

40:52.220 --> 40:52.919
And mine.

40:52.920 --> 40:53.859
What's happening up there?

40:53.860 --> 40:54.799
I'm having a crisis.
I need to talk to somebody.

40:54.800 --> 40:55.409
It's mine!

40:55.410 --> 40:56.149
It's mine!

40:56.150 --> 40:56.999
Hello?

40:57.000 --> 40:57.849
No, not... no.

40:57.850 --> 40:58.549
Not like a doctor.

40:58.550 --> 40:59.249
A doctor.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.269
I want a real big doctor.

41:01.270 --> 41:02.779
George, is everything
all right there?

41:02.780 --> 41:03.479
George!

41:03.480 --> 41:04.359
George?

41:04.360 --> 41:05.419
Will you get that?

41:05.420 --> 41:06.559
I can't hear a god damn thing.
Are you hungry?

41:06.560 --> 41:07.629
Can I get you something to eat.

41:07.630 --> 41:08.100
No.

41:08.101 --> 41:09.229
I need to speak to someone

41:09.230 --> 41:11.379
in the gastrointestinal
department.

41:11.380 --> 41:12.279
George, do me a favor.

41:12.280 --> 41:15.979
What the hell is going on?

41:15.980 --> 41:19.189
Everything's fine, Mrs. Sarni.

41:19.190 --> 41:20.809
I thought someone
died and hit the floor.

41:20.810 --> 41:21.849
I have to lie down.

41:21.850 --> 41:22.549
Jesus.

41:22.550 --> 41:23.829
Sweetie, give me the phone.

41:23.830 --> 41:24.790
Oh, god!

41:26.220 --> 41:28.779
Daddy, you never
should have ate that herring.

41:28.780 --> 41:29.579
That's right.

41:29.580 --> 41:31.869
If Daddy would listen to Mommy
and Sally, we're all in it

41:31.870 --> 41:32.449
together.
Is that "The New Yorker?"

41:32.450 --> 41:34.379
Fan me with "The New Yorker."

41:34.380 --> 41:35.959
Hey, you're well out of this.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.349
It sounds truly crazy.

41:37.350 --> 41:38.759
And I haven't even
seen her recently,

41:38.760 --> 41:40.659
because she's spending
all her time at Vince's

41:40.660 --> 41:41.569
place, which is right.

41:41.570 --> 41:42.969
I mean, you know,
that's definitely right.

41:42.970 --> 41:45.099
But what does that say
about our friendship?

41:45.100 --> 41:47.239
Maybe I didn't mean much to her.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.489
George, you know,
you sound like you

41:48.490 --> 41:49.639
talking about your ex-lover.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.489
You know, why does everything
have to be about sex with you?

41:52.490 --> 41:54.949
Y-you can get close to a woman
without sleeping with her.

41:54.950 --> 41:55.649
Really?

41:55.650 --> 41:57.030
That's... that's news to me.

41:59.890 --> 42:01.899
I'm sure Vince isn't letting
her come anywhere near me.

42:01.900 --> 42:03.089
Know shit, for your inforamtion.

42:03.090 --> 42:04.749
I should have been more open.

42:04.750 --> 42:07.489
And that could have
really been exciting.

42:07.490 --> 42:08.189
Yeah, sure.

42:08.190 --> 42:09.119
It could have been exciting.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.709
Bottom line is, she
wanted to fuck you.

42:11.710 --> 42:13.659
You... and that's insane.

42:13.660 --> 42:15.069
Look, we're both cute.

42:15.070 --> 42:16.779
And I know women.

42:16.780 --> 42:19.019
They... they tell you that
they want to be your friend,

42:19.020 --> 42:22.370
but they're really wanting
to fuck you.

42:23.070 --> 42:25.079
Anyway, the point is, I'm
going to probably have

42:25.080 --> 42:26.609
to move out, because
she'll be wanting

42:26.610 --> 42:27.619
to get rid of the apartment.

42:27.620 --> 42:29.809
So I was hoping I could crash at
your place for a couple weeks.

42:29.810 --> 42:30.549
Yes.

42:30.550 --> 42:31.369
Hey, hey.

42:31.370 --> 42:32.649
Hey!

42:32.650 --> 42:33.869
Hey.

42:33.870 --> 42:37.089
Geo... you've not met my...
my new fiancee, Suni.

42:37.090 --> 42:39.549
George... this is
my brother George.

42:39.550 --> 42:41.799
George this is
Suni from surgery.

42:41.800 --> 42:42.629
OK, you ready?

42:42.630 --> 42:43.040
Yep.

42:43.041 --> 42:44.589
You're going to go through
the... the pitching motion,

42:44.590 --> 42:45.289
all right.

42:45.290 --> 42:46.339
Real slow-mo.

42:46.340 --> 42:47.039
Hey.

42:47.040 --> 42:47.739
Where did it go?

42:47.740 --> 42:51.449
Oh, there it goes.

42:51.450 --> 42:52.360
Thanks.

42:57.000 --> 42:57.699
OK, ready?

42:57.700 --> 42:58.399
Stand up.

42:58.400 --> 42:59.169
Stand up.

42:59.170 --> 43:00.569
OK, now you're going
to hit a knee, right?

43:00.570 --> 43:01.270
Yep.

43:03.050 --> 43:05.439
That a boy, block
with your body.

43:05.440 --> 43:08.220
And then take a
step... there you go.

43:08.910 --> 43:09.699
Ready?

43:09.700 --> 43:10.399
Yeah.

43:10.400 --> 43:11.099
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:11.100 --> 43:12.280
Wait, stop right there.

43:12.980 --> 43:14.750
Face me like you're
going to do the pitch.

43:15.450 --> 43:17.349
Ready?

43:17.350 --> 43:18.939
Slow-mo.

43:18.940 --> 43:19.639
Nice.

43:19.640 --> 43:21.109
Come right over the top with it.

43:21.110 --> 43:21.809
Got it!

43:21.810 --> 43:22.739
OK, right over top.

43:22.740 --> 43:26.909
You did it great last
week in the game.

43:26.910 --> 43:28.879
OK, try it again.

43:28.880 --> 43:30.659
Now come right over
the top with it, right?

43:30.660 --> 43:31.350
Remember?

43:34.320 --> 43:35.310
That a boy!

43:59.020 --> 44:04.159
At first, the iodine does not
affect the vitamin C solution.

44:04.160 --> 44:09.389
But look what happens
if I add some more.

44:09.390 --> 44:12.140
This process is
called titration.

44:14.310 --> 44:15.009
Hey, Peter.

44:15.010 --> 44:15.969
Have you seen my father?

44:15.970 --> 44:18.099
Is there nothing that
little girl can't do?

44:18.100 --> 44:18.859
Watch TV.

44:18.860 --> 44:20.189
She's lousy at that.

44:20.190 --> 44:20.889
Doug!

44:20.890 --> 44:22.029
Hi, Sidney. How you doing?

44:22.030 --> 44:22.500
George.

44:22.500 --> 44:22.960
Yeah?

44:22.961 --> 44:24.359
My Uncle Jonathan
says he knows you.

44:24.360 --> 44:25.059
He does?

44:25.060 --> 44:26.359
Well let's go, Nathan.

44:26.360 --> 44:27.439
Hey, great job, Mary.

44:27.440 --> 44:28.209
You did excellent.

44:28.210 --> 44:28.989
Hey, George.

44:28.990 --> 44:29.689
Hi.

44:29.690 --> 44:31.889
Do recognise me in my
ear, nose, and throat gear?

44:31.890 --> 44:32.589
Uh.

44:32.590 --> 44:33.159
George!

44:33.160 --> 44:33.719
George!
Are you free next weekend?

44:33.720 --> 44:34.789
I know this great club.

44:34.790 --> 44:35.709
You know, I got a little
out of control last time.

44:35.710 --> 44:37.289
- Oh, I... I see a friend of mine.
- I know it was a little much.

44:37.290 --> 44:37.760
It was great to see you.

44:37.761 --> 44:38.439
But this place is a
converted meat market.

44:38.440 --> 44:39.159
Thanks for coming.

44:39.160 --> 44:40.789
It's incredible.

44:40.790 --> 44:41.749
What are you doing here?

44:41.750 --> 44:42.449
Oh!

44:42.450 --> 44:46.069
I promised Sally I'd come.

44:46.070 --> 44:47.029
It's so good to see you.

44:47.030 --> 44:48.949
You too.

44:48.950 --> 44:49.709
How you doing, Vince.

44:49.710 --> 44:50.409
George.

44:50.410 --> 44:51.239
We almost didn't make it.

44:51.240 --> 44:53.749
You know, our first trimester
has got us a little queasy.

44:53.750 --> 44:56.169
Yeah, Vince has become
an expert on pregnancy.

44:56.170 --> 44:57.149
I'm loving it.

44:57.150 --> 44:57.859
George, we miss you.

44:57.860 --> 44:58.689
You should come visit us.

44:58.690 --> 45:00.799
Vince, we are not
an official us.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.720
There's still you,
and there's still me.

45:05.030 --> 45:07.529
He's like glue.

45:07.530 --> 45:09.339
Madame Reynolds was
asking for you last week.

45:09.340 --> 45:10.039
Ugh!

45:10.040 --> 45:11.889
I would love to go dancing.

45:11.890 --> 45:13.429
As long as you don't
exhaust yourself.

45:13.430 --> 45:15.889
George, what time is
the trophy presentation?

45:15.890 --> 45:17.679
Uh, 20 minutes.

45:17.680 --> 45:19.219
The trophy presentation?

45:19.220 --> 45:21.799
George, what ever happened
to, it's not about winning,

45:21.800 --> 45:22.959
it's about how
you play the game?

45:22.960 --> 45:23.939
Oh, come on.

45:23.940 --> 45:25.829
I don't think there
should be any trophies.

45:25.830 --> 45:27.409
It's the parents who
want the trophies.

45:27.410 --> 45:28.509
Well, it's running
this country.

45:28.510 --> 45:30.709
The obsession with being
number one at any cost.

45:30.710 --> 45:31.999
And it starts right here.

45:32.000 --> 45:32.809
I totally hear you.

45:32.810 --> 45:34.909
You know, I mean, I
try to teach these kids

45:34.910 --> 45:35.629
a sense of community.

45:35.630 --> 45:36.329
Oh, no, believe me.

45:36.330 --> 45:37.159
You can't do that.

45:37.160 --> 45:38.939
These parents are
natural born killers.

45:38.940 --> 45:39.639
Oh, Vince.

45:39.640 --> 45:41.069
That is such bullshit.

45:41.070 --> 45:43.149
I don't know who is more
competitive than you.

45:43.150 --> 45:43.849
Ha, ha.

45:43.850 --> 45:46.369
Did I say there's anything wrong
with striving for excellence?

45:46.370 --> 45:47.479
- Oh!
- Did I say that?

45:47.480 --> 45:48.269
Jesus Christ.

45:48.270 --> 45:48.859
No, you definitely didn't that.

45:48.860 --> 45:50.389
Hey, at least
somebody here appreciates

45:50.390 --> 45:51.879
what I'm trying to say.

45:51.880 --> 45:52.679
What's your name?

45:52.680 --> 45:54.539
I'm Melissa
Marx, George's go-teacher.

45:54.540 --> 45:55.539
I'm going to lose it, George.

45:55.540 --> 45:57.219
Just get me out of here, please.

45:57.220 --> 45:58.179
Ooh!

45:58.180 --> 45:59.149
Aah!

45:59.150 --> 46:00.599
Oh!

46:00.600 --> 46:01.949
You... you're right.

46:01.950 --> 46:02.779
Oh.

46:02.780 --> 46:04.579
I didn't ask him
to come, you know.

46:04.580 --> 46:05.959
Y-y-you're absolutely right.

46:05.960 --> 46:07.529
That's not... that's
not going to work.

46:07.530 --> 46:08.229
Yeah.

46:08.230 --> 46:10.039
You know, by the way, we're
both pregnant, you know?

46:10.040 --> 46:11.899
At first we sick together.

46:11.900 --> 46:13.489
Then we throw up together.

46:13.490 --> 46:16.849
Then we get our fucking
sonograms together.

46:16.850 --> 46:18.079
Nina, it's bad equation.

46:18.080 --> 46:18.889
You, Vince and the baby?

46:18.890 --> 46:19.589
Yeah.

46:19.590 --> 46:20.459
Bad for all of you.

46:20.460 --> 46:22.089
No shit, Sherlock.

46:22.090 --> 46:25.689
You made me an offer
and I never refused.

46:25.690 --> 46:26.390
What?

46:31.360 --> 46:33.699
I spent all yesterday afternoon
watching this little kid

46:33.700 --> 46:35.140
play catch with his father.

46:37.750 --> 46:41.179
I always thought that I could
teach other people's children.

46:41.180 --> 46:47.469
But... someone else, you
know, a real guy, like Vince

46:47.470 --> 46:50.769
gets to take them home.

46:50.770 --> 46:53.019
And then I thought, I don't
always have to be the one

46:53.020 --> 46:56.949
whose watching them leave.

46:56.950 --> 47:02.249
I don't always have to be the
one who waits for twilight

47:02.250 --> 47:02.950
to pass.

47:06.030 --> 47:06.729
I don't know.

47:06.730 --> 47:11.119
For the first time, I thought
I could be the... the guy

47:11.120 --> 47:13.090
who says goodnight.

47:21.700 --> 47:22.740
What are you saying to me?

47:26.670 --> 47:27.520
I'm saying, yeah.

47:44.080 --> 47:46.890
Sorry to break this up,
but it's time to go home.

47:52.750 --> 47:56.489
Um, I'm not going to
go home with you, Vince.

47:56.490 --> 47:59.009
I'm going to go
back to Brooklyn.

47:59.010 --> 48:01.429
Well, you... you can't go
back to Brooklyn tonight.

48:01.430 --> 48:03.429
Uh, we got a doctor's
appointment in the morning.

48:03.430 --> 48:04.129
No.

48:04.130 --> 48:06.629
We don't have a
doctor's appointment.

48:06.630 --> 48:08.229
I have a doctor's appointment.

48:08.230 --> 48:09.769
Fine.

48:09.770 --> 48:11.119
OK, you have an appointment.

48:11.120 --> 48:13.420
You getting caught
up in nonsense, Nina.

48:14.230 --> 48:15.589
Vince, this isn't working.

48:15.590 --> 48:16.779
Could we talk about this later?

48:16.780 --> 48:17.479
No.

48:17.480 --> 48:19.319
No, we need to
talk about it now.

48:19.320 --> 48:20.139
In front of him?

48:20.140 --> 48:20.839
Yeah.

48:20.840 --> 48:23.469
Vince, I have tried to
talk to you in private.

48:23.470 --> 48:24.860
You don't listen to me.

48:28.720 --> 48:31.599
George.

48:31.600 --> 48:33.409
This is between me and Nina, OK?

48:33.410 --> 48:34.509
You've done enough
to fuck us up.

48:34.510 --> 48:36.049
It's time for you to get
the hell out of our lives.

48:36.050 --> 48:37.169
No, no, Vince.
This is my school.

48:37.170 --> 48:38.399
You don't get to
tell me what to do.

48:38.400 --> 48:40.459
Nothing has been the
same between me and Nina

48:40.460 --> 48:41.839
since you showed up.

48:41.840 --> 48:43.539
Does that make you happy?

48:43.540 --> 48:44.539
Is this what you do for kicks?

48:44.540 --> 48:45.229
Vince, come on.

48:45.230 --> 48:46.039
Just listen to me for...

48:46.040 --> 48:47.519
You listen to me.

48:47.520 --> 48:49.719
You... you don't see
this guy for who he is.

48:49.720 --> 48:51.260
He's a trouble
making little shit.

48:53.780 --> 48:59.210
Vince, I want to raise
my child with George.

49:07.460 --> 49:09.879
Oh.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.339
Oh.

49:11.340 --> 49:13.399
You know... you know what?

49:13.400 --> 49:15.299
I want to raise it with
the man in the moon.

49:15.300 --> 49:17.409
For once, why don't
you just goddamn

49:17.410 --> 49:18.789
listen to what she has to say?

49:18.790 --> 49:20.509
Don't you fucking tell
me how to treat a woman.

49:20.510 --> 49:22.039
Vince, just calm down
for one second, please.

49:22.040 --> 49:25.159
No, I will not calm down!

49:25.160 --> 49:29.009
You have some never,
you homo boys.

49:29.010 --> 49:31.269
You screw up women's
personal lives,

49:31.270 --> 49:36.389
but you can take any physical
responsibility for it.

49:36.390 --> 49:37.089
Listen to me.

49:37.090 --> 49:39.159
No.

49:39.160 --> 49:43.949
When this kid comes to you and
asks you who its father is,

49:43.950 --> 49:46.479
you tell it that its
father never wanted to lay

49:46.480 --> 49:48.660
eyes on its mother ever again.

50:09.910 --> 50:13.150
Head up, young person.

50:24.500 --> 50:28.059
Would you like to
hear the heartbeat?

50:28.060 --> 50:29.049
Can I?

50:29.050 --> 50:30.540
Yeah, sure.

50:57.180 --> 50:57.880
That's amazing.

51:05.830 --> 51:06.820
Oh, come on.

51:20.870 --> 51:22.529
George Hanson.

51:22.530 --> 51:23.230
Steve Casillo?

51:27.200 --> 51:29.189
Ha, ha, ha.

51:29.190 --> 51:31.399
Wow!

51:31.400 --> 51:33.799
You're not someone I'd
expect to see in here.

51:33.800 --> 51:34.629
Uh, well, yeah.

51:34.630 --> 51:38.099
Hey, uh, this is my
friend, Nina Borowski.

51:38.100 --> 51:39.309
Yeah, I can see that.

51:39.310 --> 51:40.009
Hi.

51:40.010 --> 51:40.849
You, uh, no.

51:40.850 --> 51:42.379
She's my friend.

51:42.380 --> 51:46.789
Friend, it's... just
she's expecting.

51:46.790 --> 51:48.669
Well, I can give you
a discount on this one.

51:48.670 --> 51:50.619
Oh, uh, just browsing.

51:50.620 --> 51:51.530
Yeah, with...

51:55.170 --> 51:56.560
Feel free to look around.

52:07.150 --> 52:10.049
Small world.

52:10.050 --> 52:11.509
Wow.

52:11.510 --> 52:12.279
Lemonade?

52:12.280 --> 52:13.719
Nick will
be along with the First on Fox...

52:13.720 --> 52:14.180
Thanks.

52:14.181 --> 52:15.549
Forecast in a moment.

52:15.550 --> 52:17.259
The Hanson Benefit
season was in...

52:17.260 --> 52:18.199
Oh, my god.

52:18.200 --> 52:19.999
Full
swing at super agent Sidney.

52:20.000 --> 52:20.989
Miller's house this weekend.

52:20.990 --> 52:23.379
Guests included Anne
Rice, King Hussein,

52:23.380 --> 52:24.989
and General Colin Powell.

52:24.990 --> 52:26.419
Hot fun in the summertime.

52:26.420 --> 52:27.489
So how come we weren't invited?

52:27.490 --> 52:28.189
I don't know.

52:28.190 --> 52:29.470
Oh, thank god we
weren't invited.

52:33.830 --> 52:36.319
George, who that man in
the crib store today?

52:36.320 --> 52:39.660
Aw, just someone I, uh, had a
fling with before I met Joley.

52:44.770 --> 52:50.349
You know, if you ever
wanted to invite him here,

52:50.350 --> 52:52.629
that would be fine.

52:52.630 --> 52:54.049
Mm-hmm.

52:54.050 --> 52:55.131
I could sleep in your room.

53:00.180 --> 53:02.849
What if I said,
that's a great idea.

53:02.850 --> 53:06.020
He'll be right over?

53:06.910 --> 53:08.050
I'd say, great.

53:10.740 --> 53:13.469
I mean, this isn't a marriage.

53:13.470 --> 53:17.949
You know, I don't want to
make you give up your life.

53:17.950 --> 53:18.650
You're not.

53:21.780 --> 53:22.480
Great.

53:26.320 --> 53:28.419
Um, so are you
going to call him?

53:28.420 --> 53:30.749
Actually, I'm leaving
with him for Paris tonight.

53:30.750 --> 53:31.450
You are?

53:37.230 --> 53:39.969
I just hate secrets, George.

53:39.970 --> 53:40.799
What secrets?

53:40.800 --> 53:43.719
I tell you everything.

53:43.720 --> 53:45.779
Just promise me that
if anything in your life

53:45.780 --> 53:47.859
changes that you'll tell me.

53:47.860 --> 53:49.399
Nothing's going to change.

53:49.400 --> 53:50.779
Look, I'm not going anywhere.

53:50.780 --> 53:51.800
This isn't temporary.

53:57.750 --> 53:59.979
Don't you miss men?

53:59.980 --> 54:01.499
Yeah, sure.

54:01.500 --> 54:02.789
Sometimes.

54:02.790 --> 54:05.219
Dont' you?

54:05.220 --> 54:05.920
I guess.

54:08.850 --> 54:10.411
But I don't miss them
when I'm with you.

54:19.440 --> 54:21.859
Mm.

54:21.860 --> 54:26.899
Do think most married couples
are as happy as we are?

54:26.900 --> 54:31.329
I hope so, because
we're pretty happy.

54:31.330 --> 54:33.229
Hm.

54:33.230 --> 54:39.759
I guess sex is just no big deal.

54:39.760 --> 54:41.410
Not even with Lucy Jane?

54:44.240 --> 54:45.629
Oh, I just adore you, Nina.

54:45.630 --> 54:46.819
I really do.

54:46.820 --> 54:48.310
I adore you, too.

56:48.700 --> 56:50.139
Yeah?

56:50.140 --> 56:52.749
George, hi.

56:52.750 --> 56:54.469
It's Joley.

56:54.470 --> 56:56.469
How are you?

56:56.470 --> 56:59.669
And, uh, oh, god.

56:59.670 --> 57:01.789
These things are so weird.

57:01.790 --> 57:03.719
I guess.

57:03.720 --> 57:06.629
Who is it?

57:06.630 --> 57:09.469
Uh, my brother.

57:09.470 --> 57:11.000
George, are you still there?

57:14.050 --> 57:17.669
Yeah, uh, Nina says hello.

57:17.670 --> 57:19.119
Oh.

57:19.120 --> 57:20.989
I was so sure you'd be
with someone by now.

57:20.990 --> 57:26.129
That's, um, that's really
why I haven't called.

57:26.130 --> 57:29.229
Yeah, Nina's still here.

57:29.230 --> 57:31.969
George, it's
so good to hear your voice.

57:31.970 --> 57:33.889
Uh, I'm surprised
you'd even talk to me.

57:33.890 --> 57:37.329
I behaved like an idiot.

57:37.330 --> 57:39.399
Look, I've been asked
to address a critics

57:39.400 --> 57:41.779
convention at your old college
the weekend after next.

57:41.780 --> 57:46.639
And I've been thinking about
that time we drove up there.

57:46.640 --> 57:48.690
That was our first Christmas
together, you remember?

57:52.160 --> 57:55.729
And so you want me
to come with you?

57:55.730 --> 57:58.309
That's very considerate of you.

57:58.310 --> 58:00.489
I wouldn't be surprised if you
never wanted to lay eyes on me

58:00.490 --> 58:05.469
again, but it would
really mean a lot

58:05.470 --> 58:09.989
to me just to be with you.

58:09.990 --> 58:14.060
I made a reservation at that
sweet little inn we stayed at.

58:15.950 --> 58:19.689
Ah, well, I'll call
you if I can make it.

58:19.690 --> 58:22.269
Think about all the time.

58:22.270 --> 58:28.099
And, um, for what it's
worth, I really miss you.

58:28.100 --> 58:29.169
Yep.

58:29.170 --> 58:29.869
Thank you.

58:29.870 --> 58:32.370
I'll talk to you soon.

58:39.220 --> 58:40.380
Where does he want you to go?

58:44.080 --> 58:44.779
Hm?

58:44.780 --> 58:45.500
Oh, my college.

58:50.260 --> 58:50.960
For a reunion?

58:53.670 --> 58:56.289
Sort of.

58:56.290 --> 59:00.130
Hey, uh, Nina that
was, uh, Joley.

59:10.730 --> 59:13.629
So are you going to go?

59:13.630 --> 59:14.560
I don't know.

59:17.380 --> 59:18.820
That usually means yes.

59:22.260 --> 59:24.130
I hate that you
know me so well.

59:31.910 --> 59:32.639
Hi.

59:32.640 --> 59:33.340
Hey.

59:37.620 --> 59:40.729
You look great.

59:40.730 --> 59:41.750
I love this.

59:44.700 --> 59:48.069
I'll call you at Constance's
tomorrow morning, kiddo.

59:48.070 --> 59:50.169
Promise?

59:50.170 --> 59:52.079
I promise.

59:52.080 --> 59:53.519
What time?

59:53.520 --> 59:54.480
Early, I promise.

59:57.350 --> 01:00:00.239
Ordinarily, I wouldn't
go to one of these conferences,

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.169
but they insisted
that I come, and, uh,

01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:05.219
I guess it never hurts to stay
on the good side of reviewers.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.099
Oh, my book!

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:09.049
Did I tell you my book is coming
out in paperback in England?

01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:11.439
It's very impressive for
an American Shaw scholar

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.090
to do so well in Europe.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.840
You OK, honey?

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.199
How did we get back so
quickly to the honey stage?

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.010
Maybe we never
should have left it.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.919
So how's your student?

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.479
Back with his girlfriend.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.139
He's, well, just
a screwed up kid.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.799
So you want to be friends now?

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.149
Just so I know.

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:48.459
That is exactly
your problem, George.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:49.669
What?

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:51.499
Your lack of self-worth.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:57.069
No, you have no idea how
important you are to me.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.889
Thank you.

01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:00.909
So I've been
thinking about you a lot.

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:03.509
You're living with a woman
in a dump in Brooklyn.

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:07.419
And I'm lonely and...
and missing you.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:10.119
We can do better than that.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.869
Nina!

01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:12.569
Hi.

01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:14.529
You just missed Steven
Spielberg and Peter Jennings.

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:17.099
Oh, I bet they sent
their best regards.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.899
Sweetie, don't
start the weekend like this.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.109
I have enough to deal with.

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:21.139
What are you wearing?

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.969
I... hello, honey.

01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:23.739
How are you?

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:24.150
Good!

01:01:24.151 --> 01:01:25.019
Mwah!

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.439
Where's George?

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.799
George is with
this old boyfriend,

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.729
which is where he should be.

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:29.649
Oh, Constance!

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:31.809
He's not with his old boyfriend.

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:34.009
You told me he went
away with Dr. Joley.

01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:36.099
It doesn't mean he's with him.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.319
Sally, sit down and buckle up.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.639
Sweetie, I want you
to relax this weekend.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.099
Take walks, eat good food, let
Sidney and me take care of you.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:44.799
And me.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.759
And Sally.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.459
Yes, I know.

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.099
We're going to
have a nice relaxing

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.989
dinner, just some old friends,
and Stephen Saint is coming.

01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:53.549
And you'll never believe it.

01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:55.159
He's just dying to see you.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.150
You made quite an impression
on him at my party.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:05.599
Hello.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.299
Hello.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.149
Dr. Robert Joley.

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:09.279
Ah, yes, Dr. Joley.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.199
We have you down for three
nights and a king sized bed.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.099
Twin beds.

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.699
I don't know that I
have a room with twins.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.399
We'll take the king.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.359
Uh, excuse me.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.929
I have a room with twin beds.

01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:20.609
I'd be happy to
exchange with you.

01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:21.539
Are you sure, Mrs. Skinner?

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.559
Surely.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.839
Thank you, Mrs. Skinner.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.089
No sense in you two boys
being on top of each other.

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:28.389
Right at the
head of the stairs.

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:30.549
Thank you.

01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:33.399
Um, I thought we were supposed
to get the discount rate.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.499
Oh, that is the
discount rate, doctor.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.859
Right through the,
uh, dining room.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:38.979
Dr. Joley, I presume.

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:41.189
Well, Rodney Fraser.

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:43.509
You're one of the reasons
I agreed to come here.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:44.509
Oh, thank you.

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:47.809
I see you've lost
none of your charm.

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:50.889
Oh, by the way, congratulations
on George Bernard Shaw.

01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:51.589
Thank you.

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:55.179
That's always such
a... such a treat

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:57.699
to read an American
perspective on the subject.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.679
Hm.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.389
Oh, this is Paul James.

01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:02.329
Dr. Robert Joley.

01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:03.729
Don't think I've
met your friend.

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:04.789
Oh, George Hanson.

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:06.229
George Hanson, how do you do.

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:08.089
Paul James.

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:08.809
You in the theatre?

01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:10.849
No, he's a graduate
of our host college.

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:11.739
Really?

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.429
The return of the native.

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:14.339
Hm.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.589
Well, I'll look
forward to seeing

01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:18.499
you both around the campus, hm?

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.549
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:20.250
See you.

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.649
I wonder if Mrs. Rodney
charges by the hour?

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:26.959
Let me tell you something.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.459
When my first wife left me,
she wanted to take my clients.

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:30.159
I know.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.249
I mean, I understand the
house, the car, and all that.

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:34.249
But my clients!

01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:35.489
She wanted my clients.

01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:37.919
You know, uh,
since we last met,

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:42.259
I've done some heavy therapy
and, uh, taken up yoga.

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.789
And I quit advertising.

01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:44.489
Hm.

01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:46.479
So I know this
might seem premature,

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.150
but, um, I'm ready to be
the father of your child.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.380
Night.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.319
Good night.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.509
And our thanks
to Miss Gutierrez

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:29.519
for an extremely
interesting question,

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.889
and a spirited response
from the panel.

01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:38.159
And now we move on to,
um, oh, another question

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.079
from Miss Gutierrez.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:40.949
Oh, yes.

01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:42.479
How do you feel
about great works

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:46.349
of literature being transformed
into musical comedy?

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:49.399
Well, that sounds like one
for our academic colleague.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.509
Professor.

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:55.989
Well, um, I should begin
by saying that I think

01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:57.899
that "My Fair Lady" is
a complete distortion

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.469
of Shaw's "Pygmalion,"
as is "West Side.

01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:02.379
Story" of "Romeo and Juliet."

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.189
But then, I hate all musicals.

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:08.919
I, um, believe they're,
uh, middle brow, populist,

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:13.119
and, um, frankly, dangerous.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.280
So it's a clean
sweep from Dr. Joley.

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.009
I have seen performance
art in cross-gender clubs

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:23.109
in Berlin that has far more
theatrical impact than anything

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:25.269
I have ever seen on Broadway.

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:27.799
Well, do you mean,
um, women dipped in chocolate?

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.629
That sort of thing?

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:30.519
I'm talking about
serious artists here.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.439
I have never recovered
from the Ulrika Schinkel's

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.939
brilliant production
of Beethoven

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.099
in Ketten, that's
Beethoven in Bondage, set

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.579
amongst to the ruins
of the Riechstag.

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.139
And, uh, something that may be
of particular interest to you,

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:42.189
Rodney, is that the
theatres in Germany

01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:44.119
are filled with young people.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.589
Nina!

01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:47.549
Mommy says we're all taking
a picnic at the beach.

01:05:47.550 --> 01:05:49.689
Oh, honey, I'm waiting
for a phone call.

01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:50.389
Oh!

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:52.599
Mommy, Nina's waiting
for a phone call.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.219
Sally, go get your father.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:56.359
Go.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.419
I'll come there
later, I promise.

01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.429
Jesus Christ.

01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:01.229
Every time I look at
you, you're moping.

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:02.349
You know, you're a guest here.

01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:03.429
You could try to make an effort.

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:05.379
I have made an effort.

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.939
Stephen loved me.

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:08.169
I hope you realise
he's currently

01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:10.199
in bed with his old boyfriend.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:10.899
Who, Stephen?

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.199
The man whose call
you're waiting for.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.509
You know, I enjoy gay people.

01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:20.479
I just have a slight problem
with my pregnant sister

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.949
being in love with one of them.

01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:23.809
I am not in love with him.

01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:26.059
Honestly, even when I was
desperate to marry Sidney,

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.359
I never carried on like you do.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.629
And Sidney is straight.

01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:30.099
But you have really done it.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.729
This is an even crazier
choice than Vincent.

01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:32.851
You're not even fucking him.

01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:41.069
Can I ask you something?

01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:44.769
When was the last time
you and Sidney had sex?

01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:46.199
That is not the point.

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.369
Exactly!

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:49.249
Doesn't it all turn
into friendship anyway?

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:51.579
Yes, but normal people
start out someplace you

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.379
and the nursery school teacher
are never going to get.

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:54.879
You know, you should
take a look at yourself.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.149
You're supposed to
be a psychiatrist.

01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:57.629
I am a social
worker, Constance!

01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:58.329
Oh!

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:01.609
Will you just let me
live my god damn life?

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:03.319
Read my lips.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:07.289
George is g-a-y, gay.

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:09.359
That means he never
sleeps with women.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.769
He has slept with a woman.

01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:14.129
What?

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:15.929
Lucy Jane Parnell.

01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:17.329
Oh, please.

01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:19.499
Don't tell me, in high school?

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.669
They all try women
once in high school.

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:22.889
But you're nutty
enough to believe

01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:24.149
that based on that
experience you

01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:25.749
can bring him to his senses.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.379
Nina, a gay nursery
school teacher

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:28.810
is a one-way ticket to nowhere.

01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:34.289
I would love to
go to a place like this.

01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:37.579
Read, sleep, have
great talks, sex.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:40.229
Well, uh, we didn't, uh,
actually have much of that.

01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:42.009
We did talk about it a lot.

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:43.139
Well, did you act at all?

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:43.839
Me?

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.899
No, not really.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:45.659
You an actor?

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:47.959
Well, trying to be.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.539
That's how I met Rodney.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.779
I sat in on his
World Theatre class.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:54.639
Oh, What's his
take on world theatre?

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.779
Well, Rodney is very picky.

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:59.519
He likes "Damn Yankees"
and Shakespeare.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:00.569
But just to read.

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:02.730
He's never seen a production
up to his standards.

01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:08.349
Don't you get flak
from your actor friends

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.269
being with a critic?

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:12.309
Well, I've never been
with him, with him.

01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:14.999
It's just that he came up
to me one day after class,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.859
and he's been sort of like
my mentor and my family

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:18.859
ever since.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:21.158
Oh, uh, I thought maybe
you lived together.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:21.939
I'm sorry.

01:08:21.939 --> 01:08:24.198
Oh, we do live together.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.658
He offered me a spare
room so I could save

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.479
my money for acting lessons.

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:31.089
Well, I've always
had terrible judgement.

01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:33.319
My entire freshman year,
I had a crush on a guy

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:37.078
named Trotter Bull III.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.779
He looked just like
one of those rowers.

01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:42.069
Looks like pretty
good judgement to me.

01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:43.419
Except he had a girlfriend.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.229
I actually got up the
courage to talk to him

01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:49.589
one night about Walt Whitman.

01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:51.089
He probably became
an investment banker,

01:08:51.090 --> 01:08:54.238
had four kids,
all named Trotter,

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.979
and, uh, never talked
about poetry again.

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:02.689
I'll talk to you about poetry.

01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:07.689
Sure, anything.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.078
How about a swim?

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.049
Whoo!

01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:13.979
Wait for me.

01:09:13.979 --> 01:09:14.729
Ha!

01:09:14.729 --> 01:09:15.430
Ha, ha, ha.

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:21.709
I've got it.

01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:22.669
It's for me.

01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:23.639
Sorry.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.499
Hello.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.819
Good
morning, Is Mrs. Miller in?

01:09:26.819 --> 01:09:28.339
No, she's at the beach.

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.689
Uh, this is Martha Stewart.

01:09:30.689 --> 01:09:31.618
Uh-huh.

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:34.439
It's Martha
Stewart for Mrs. Miller.

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:35.559
Yes.

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.609
Is it "the" Martha Stewart?

01:09:37.609 --> 01:09:38.309
Yes.

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:39.408
Hello?

01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:40.439
Oh, will you hold on, please?

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:42.389
Yes.

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:45.669
Miss Stewart, I'm having a
big problem with my azaleas.

01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:46.929
Oh, I know.

01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:49.609
That's been such a problem.

01:09:49.609 --> 01:09:50.749
Uh-huh.

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:53.399
Will I see you again?

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:55.569
I hope so.

01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:57.829
When do I call you?

01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:59.779
Oh, fuck.

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:00.479
My roommate!

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.219
I was supposed to
call her this morning.

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.269
Shit!

01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:04.349
Your roommate?

01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:06.479
Yeah, we live together.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.719
We don't live live together.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.069
We just live together.

01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.769
Shit!

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.289
She's in her bedroom.

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:11.989
I'll call her.

01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:14.129
She's in bed, apparently.

01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:15.039
Hi, George.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:15.739
Hey, kiddo.

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:16.439
Why are you in bed?

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.539
Are you sick?

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.389
I'm pregnant, George.

01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:22.679
Or have you been so busy with
Dr. Joley that you forgot?

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:24.709
Nothing's happened
with Dr. Joley.

01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:27.379
I've hardly seen him.

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.779
So then let's go home.

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.689
What do you mean?

01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:33.319
There's a bus at 7 o'clock.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.019
Tonight?

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:37.139
Sure, why not?

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:39.619
I don't want you
travelling alone so late.

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:41.429
But how about I borrow
my brother's car

01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:43.139
and pick you up
tomorrow afternoon?

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:44.229
George, please.

01:10:44.230 --> 01:10:46.319
Please, this is...
I'm so miserable.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.019
Please.

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.179
Th... you could... you
could be on a train, too.

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:52.519
And we could both be in
our beds by midnight.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.339
Nina, uh...

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.929
Please, you have to rescue me.

01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:56.659
I have got to get
away from here.

01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.461
And there's nothing for
you to stay there for.

01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:04.429
Anybody who bolts from
the Hamptons is OK with me.

01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:05.959
I hate it here.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:06.950
It's so pretentious.

01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:12.269
If I wasn't happily
married and you

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:14.619
weren't my wife's stepsister,
I'd have an affair with you

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:15.320
in a second.

01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:18.079
I think you're terrific.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.149
Aw.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:20.179
Want some money?

01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:20.879
No, I'm fine.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.579
I'm fine.

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:22.419
How about some Chuckles?

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:23.119
Hm?

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.069
No.

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.769
Good.

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:27.099
I got the Galleys for the new
Michael Creighton in the car.

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:27.799
Oh, no.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.970
Really, thanks, Sidney.

01:11:31.670 --> 01:11:32.459
Oh, gosh.

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.159
I'd have left it.

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.640
I got it.

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:43.079
No, he didn't.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:43.869
But I thought he did.

01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:44.671
No, that looks good.

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:49.030
Hi.

01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:53.490
Hi, pet.

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.749
Hi, Melissa.

01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:59.440
Hi.

01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:17.489
So how are you, huh?

01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:18.419
Oh, shit!

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:19.489
Hey, let me help you with that.

01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:20.479
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.459
Got it.

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.940
I'm fine.

01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:26.889
Thank you.

01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:27.870
Vince, honey?

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:42.939
Watch your step.

01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:44.039
Melissa, hang on a minute.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.039
I'm just going to say goodbye.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.119
Vince, I'm really tired.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:46.819
I don't feel like...

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.349
No, it'll just be a minute.

01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:49.469
Hey, can I put you in a taxi?

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:50.439
No, Vince, I'm fine, really.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:50.720
Thanks.

01:12:50.721 --> 01:12:51.949
Now, Nita, come
on, you're pregnant.

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:53.119
Vince, please,
I'm fine, really.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.209
Give my love to George.

01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:55.009
Oh, sure.

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:56.600
I certainly will.

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:02.000
Hey!

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.239
Uh... oh, excuse me!

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.219
Excuse me.

01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:20.159
Oh, you're going to
be so glad you met me.

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.029
My purse was just
stolen and I'm pregnant

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:24.729
and I have no way home.

01:13:24.730 --> 01:13:25.859
Are you hurt?

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:26.829
No, I'm fine.

01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:27.739
You sure?

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.729
Yeah, it's just my
purse was stolen.

01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:31.859
OK, well, let's go.

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.559
All right.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:33.969
I got it.

01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:35.399
Oh, thank god.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.079
So we'll go report all this.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.049
Thank you.

01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:40.099
And then I'm getting off duty,
so I'll give you a lift home.

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:40.979
Great.

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:41.859
Thanks.

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.949
I mean, I'm surprised
he didn't arrest me.

01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:46.599
I get mugged and the god
damn desk sergeant blames me.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.889
He's the only one like that.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.679
The rest of us are
very sensitive.

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.379
Lady, you asked for it.

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:52.659
I mean, I thought
people like that

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:54.829
were banned from the
police force, you know?

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:56.519
I mean, it's none of
his god damn business

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.279
where the fuck my husband is.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.869
You know, I mean, you
don't seem to care.

01:13:59.870 --> 01:14:00.569
Me?

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:02.379
I used to give women
lots of opinions.

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.989
But now I go with the flow.

01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:07.889
Are you gay?

01:14:07.890 --> 01:14:08.589
I'm sorry?

01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:10.379
I have this new
theory that any man

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:13.629
doesn't hit you over the head
with his opinions must be gay.

01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:15.669
Well, that makes as
much sense as Freud.

01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:18.729
Oh, well, it makes a hell of
a lot more sense than Freud.

01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:23.219
Freud doesn't know
dick about women.

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:26.669
I can't believe
I just said that.

01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:28.639
Very nice of you
to drive me home.

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.619
Oh, not a problem.

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:32.580
If I were married, I'd want
someone to drive my wife home.

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:38.249
Will your husband be there?

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:39.079
I don't have a husband.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:39.490
No?

01:14:39.491 --> 01:14:40.229
The father?

01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:41.819
Oh, no, no.

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.559
He will definitely not be there.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.379
I hardly speak to him.

01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:50.569
Well, you don't find anyone
new till your brave enough

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:53.779
to give up the old.

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:56.309
I don't really want
to find anyone new.

01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:58.189
Oh, that's good.

01:14:58.190 --> 01:15:00.149
Happy with the status quo.

01:15:00.150 --> 01:15:01.069
Yeah.

01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:02.449
Me, too.

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:04.749
But you're so nice.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:08.399
You should be married.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.739
You think all nice
people are married?

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:14.859
What kind of counsellor are you?

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.279
Great, you can stop
right over there.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.250
Oh, thank you so much.

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:25.529
Oh.

01:15:25.530 --> 01:15:28.489
You're really kind.

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:29.190
Oh.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.669
George!

01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:35.369
Oh, my gosh!

01:15:35.370 --> 01:15:36.349
You're back already?

01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:38.319
Hi!

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.709
Oh!

01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:40.779
Did you get a ride home?

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:43.519
No, my purse got
stolen at the bus station.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.219
What?

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:46.229
And Vince and Melissa
were on the bus.

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:48.489
And Sidney told me that he
would have an affair with me.

01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:52.769
I mean, it's just been
the weekend from hell.

01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:54.740
Come on, I'll
make you some tea.

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:11.509
Hi, sweetie.

01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:13.389
George, terrific news
about you and Dr. Joley.

01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:14.539
Sidney and I adore him.

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:15.239
He's so smart.

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:15.929
Good for you.

01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:16.629
Thanks.

01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:19.149
Bye, George.

01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:20.599
Hey!

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:23.729
Hey, Nina, you find out
who the father is yet?

01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:26.029
I call the shots, Keesha.

01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:29.019
Yeah!

01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:30.859
So what's for supper, Nina?

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:31.619
Pot roast.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.319
Mm.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.189
It's George's favourite.

01:16:33.190 --> 01:16:34.179
Is he back yet?

01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.130
I don't know?

01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:37.519
Paul?

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.849
Oh, jeez!

01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:41.429
He's supposed to
be at the theatre.

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:42.919
Paul?

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:46.189
I fled at half time.

01:16:46.190 --> 01:16:49.009
A lot of pumped up men
taking their clothes off.

01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:50.919
It's all getting
dreadfully boring.

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:54.739
I'm going to see "King Lear"
tomorrow night, god help me.

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:57.349
I fully expect him to step on
stage, say he's old, he's hot,

01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:59.179
and strip down to his underwear.

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:02.219
Oh, uh, would you
like a glass of vino?

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:03.469
And, uh, tell
whoever it is you've

01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:05.970
got in there he's left
his knapsack on the sofa.

01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:17.929
Ah, it's the graduate.

01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:20.440
Do, please, come sit down.

01:17:31.890 --> 01:17:34.509
Uh, Paul and I are
currently meandering

01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:36.969
through some of the better
Australian Chardonnays.

01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:38.059
Can I tempt you?

01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:40.319
Oh, no thank you.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.299
Oh.

01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.000
Paul?

01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:50.379
So, how's our distinguished
Shavian scholar, Dr. Joley.

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:53.780
Well, I haven't seen him
since the Critics Convention.

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.929
Actually, George
lives with a woman.

01:18:01.930 --> 01:18:04.139
Really?

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:06.679
How Bloomsbury.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.529
Ha, ha.

01:18:07.530 --> 01:18:09.299
Yeah, uh, Nina is
my best friend.

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:10.609
Well, as you probably
know, Paul and I

01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:11.909
visit the theater quite often.

01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:13.179
Perhaps you and your
best friend would

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:15.899
care to join us one evening.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.309
That's very kind of you.

01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:21.879
But, um, well, I'm not... I'm
not sure she likes the theatre.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.399
Oh, well, she's
absolutely right.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.689
There's nothing to see.

01:18:25.690 --> 01:18:27.529
Hm, hm.

01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:31.149
Well, perhaps we could go and
have a meal together some time.

01:18:31.150 --> 01:18:35.989
We'd like to see more of
you, in any event, you know?

01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:38.299
Well, I... I hope so.

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.949
You know, I'm sorry,
I really, uh...

01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:41.330
Go, really.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:46.420
Don't forget your little bag.

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:49.589
- Well, it was nice seeing you.
- Yes, indeed.

01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:50.219
Good night.

01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:50.920
Good night.

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:54.690
I'll be right back.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:03.761
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:21.560
Thank you returning my call.

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.859
Nina, you were probably
right, you know?

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:30.869
You and I as a couple were
a pretty miserable match.

01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:32.409
But I still love you.

01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:34.599
That's... that's my problem.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:39.019
I can... I can deal with that.

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:43.969
Nina, whatever way that
you're planning on doing this,

01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:48.289
for once in my life, I'm...
I'm not going to tell you how.

01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:51.509
I would just like to
think that I could somehow

01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:52.990
be a part of the picture.

01:19:56.890 --> 01:19:59.820
Vince, you're the daddy.

01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:04.209
It's all right.

01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:06.399
I'll trust you.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.929
Oh, hi!

01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:08.859
Hi!

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:09.559
How are you?

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.179
Louis.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:10.879
Yes.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.029
This is Vince.

01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.929
Uh, hi, Louis Crowley.

01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:13.809
He, Vince McBride, hi.

01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:17.179
Hi, uh, this is my nephew
Joe, and my niece Sophie.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:18.709
Yeah, Vince is the
father of my, uh...

01:20:18.710 --> 01:20:19.409
Baby.

01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:21.059
I'm the father of the baby.

01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:22.459
Oh, I see.

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:23.849
And, uh, how's, uh...

01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:24.599
George, my roommate.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.299
He's fine.

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:26.679
He's home.

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.509
Oh.

01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:30.309
Hey, great.

01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:31.109
Go with the flow.

01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:32.599
That's right.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:35.089
The workings
of her mind appeal to him.

01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:38.579
She leaves her warm bed in
the cold dawn to rush there,

01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:40.069
full of zeal and loyalty.

01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:42.070
Why would she do that?

01:20:55.810 --> 01:20:57.409
Coming up,
Kurt will have sports.

01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:58.599
Stay with us.

01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.699
Yes, we'd like

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:02.180
to change the address on the
checking account, please.

01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:12.589
Hi.

01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:14.079
Hey.

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:15.069
Sorry.

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:16.059
Don't worry about it.

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:18.049
Hi, sorry I'm late.

01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:19.769
Yeah, god, I'm sorry.

01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:23.139
Did, uh, Nina tell you I was
visiting some college friends

01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:24.429
and drank too much?

01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:26.249
Well, why didn't
you bring them?

01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:27.159
What?

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.069
Mm.

01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:30.359
I mean, what a shame to
break up such a great party,

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.189
you know?

01:21:31.190 --> 01:21:35.049
I mean, actually, I'd like to
meet your friends some day.

01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:36.509
So how late did you stay up?

01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:37.389
Late.

01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:41.359
So late there wasn't a
cab left in Manhattan, huh?

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:44.199
Well, you know, we
all wrecked to go home.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:44.899
Whew, yeah!

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.969
My big brother is
a party animal.

01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:47.739
Coffee?

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:48.939
Oh, yeah, please.

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.129
Do you want to
hear the specials?

01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:50.829
You know what?

01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:55.649
I'll just have the orange
juice and eggs Florentine.

01:21:55.650 --> 01:21:58.569
So Caroline, is the
wedding still on?

01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:02.709
I haven't heard
otherwise, but I'm waiting.

01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:04.109
Well, we're really
looking forward to it.

01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:06.329
Yeah, if you can make it.

01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:08.899
He's been really busy this fall
with, uh, faculty meetings.

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:11.469
Yeah, I'm trying to get things
in order before the baby comes.

01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:12.639
Working out a new curriculum.

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.739
Jesus, I never thought
I'd hear my big brother

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.239
talk about babies coming.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.549
And before me.

01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:18.659
That's what really
pisses me off.

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:19.489
You got there before me.

01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:22.689
Now I think what you guys are
doing is fantastic, really.

01:22:22.690 --> 01:22:24.529
Here's my question, though.

01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:26.349
What about the father?

01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:29.389
This guy must be the most
interesting guy in the world,

01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:30.779
or the most tolerant.

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:34.519
Actually, he's dating
George's colleague, Melissa.

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:37.129
So that takes a shit
load of tolerance.

01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:37.829
No, honey.

01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:38.979
They're not dating anymore.

01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.249
They broke up.

01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:41.259
Wait a minute, who is this?

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:41.959
Melissa?

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.059
Is she cute?

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:43.829
Frank.

01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:47.389
Hey, I'm just trying to keep
my options open, all right?

01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:49.519
Oh, Frank, your horrible.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.609
George, aren't we
all just horrible?

01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:53.179
Aren't men just such jerks?

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:55.039
Now, I think that
Nina and George

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.229
have a great relationship.

01:22:56.230 --> 01:23:00.420
Yeah, when we see each other
we have a great relationship.

01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:08.309
Hey, George, um, when they
start complaining about not

01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:10.959
seeing you enough, you
have to buy them a diamond,

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:13.959
or take them to the theatre.

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.859
Hey, maybe we could all
go see a friend of mine

01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:18.059
who's in a play next weekend.

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:19.749
Well, I'm on call next weekend.

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:22.399
And Frank certainly
isn't going without me.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.789
Oh, come on.

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:24.489
No, no.

01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:28.219
So does that mean I get a date
alone with you this weekend?

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:30.660
Or will I get another
call Saturday afternoon?

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:37.519
Saints do not move,
they grant for prayers' sake.

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.870
Then move not while my
prayer's effect I take.

01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:50.139
Thus from my lips by
thine, my sin is purged.

01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:53.089
Then have my lips, the
sin that they have took.

01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:55.109
Sin from thy lips?

01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:58.089
O trespass sweetly urged!

01:23:58.090 --> 01:24:02.010
Give me my sin again.

01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:09.360
You kiss by the book.

01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:17.689
Ha, here we are.

01:24:17.690 --> 01:24:19.159
Soda, my dear.

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.139
Thanks.

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:21.629
Well, cheers, cheers.

01:24:21.630 --> 01:24:22.399
Cheers.

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.389
It's so nice to meet you.

01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:25.380
George talks about
you all the time.

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.129
Fantastic, man.

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.819
Oh!

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:33.309
You were fantastic.

01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:34.299
Hey!

01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:36.499
Oh, and, uh, this is Nina.

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.169
Hi. You were great.

01:24:38.170 --> 01:24:39.199
Hey, it's great to meet you.

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.699
George talks about
you all the time.

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:42.039
Hey, George!

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:42.929
George!

01:24:42.930 --> 01:24:44.269
Hey, how are you?

01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:45.349
Oh, I want you to meet somebody.

01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:47.149
Uh, I don't know if you
remember me from college?

01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:47.849
Oh, my god!

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:48.549
Yeah!

01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:50.319
We talked all night about
what women... Trotter Bull.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.019
Paul!

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:51.879
Paul!

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:52.579
Paul!

01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:54.609
Th... ha, ha, this
is Trotter Bull.

01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:56.389
Oh, my god!

01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:58.009
I've heard so much about you.

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:01.249
George talks about
you all the time.

01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.949
Is that right?

01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:03.729
Well, you were
wonderful in the play.

01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:05.129
You were wonderful in the play.

01:25:05.130 --> 01:25:05.829
And he looked so hot.

01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:07.399
Wasn't he great?

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.189
George, it was so
nice seeing you again.

01:25:09.190 --> 01:25:10.599
Let me give you my
card if you ever

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.760
need a stockbroker some time.

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:13.549
Yeah, thanks a lot.

01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:14.419
Great seeing you, Trotter.

01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:15.139
Oh, look, Trotter.

01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.979
We got that, you
know, 10:00 thing.

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:19.579
- Nice to meet you.
- Way to go, Jonathan.

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:21.579
I wish he'd been our
Mercutio instead of who we got.

01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:22.959
Rodney, please.

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.549
And he was right,
you were awful good.

01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:27.649
But you know, people only
do modern dress Shakespeare.

01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:31.049
But there's absolutely no
instinct for any other periods

01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:32.689
or languages than their own.

01:25:32.690 --> 01:25:34.739
Clearly, the no-talent
who directed this

01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:38.329
hoped to transform the
world's greatest love story

01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:40.559
into a Calvin Klein commercial.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.149
The man should be shot.

01:25:42.150 --> 01:25:42.999
Mr. Fraser.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:43.859
Yes.

01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:45.109
I'm the director.

01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:46.060
Ah.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.789
Hey, come on.

01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:51.859
Let me help you.

01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:53.959
Thank you.

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.659
Good night.

01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:55.559
Yes, good night.

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:57.519
Listen, Paul, uh,
George and I were

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.959
wondering what you and Rodney
were doing for Thanksgiving?

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.659
Oh, no.

01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:01.160
I'm sorry, we...

01:26:01.161 --> 01:26:01.859
No, no, no, no.

01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:02.999
We'd love to come.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.009
How kind of you.

01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.710
Oh.

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.059
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:08.119
Wonderful.

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.019
OK, so 1:00.

01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:10.810
We'll be there.

01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:16.389
Good night.

01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:19.269
You're an extraordinary person.

01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:20.690
They seem like a lovely couple.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.759
Hey, you!

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:29.669
I don't care what you
say, I love Les Mis.

01:26:29.670 --> 01:26:32.060
And I think Andrew Lloyd
Webber was a genius!

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:36.779
Hello.

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:37.479
Hi.

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.179
Oh, hello.

01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:39.399
How lovely to see you again.

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:40.609
Happy Thanksgiving.
We're just through here.

01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:41.309
George.

01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:42.249
Hey, hi.

01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:42.949
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:44.139
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:45.169
So do you need any help?

01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:46.799
No, everything
is absolutely fine.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:49.109
Oh, what a relief, because
contrary to stereotype,

01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:50.589
I'm an awful cook.

01:26:50.590 --> 01:26:52.309
Oh, no.

01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:54.779
Well, please, please just
make yourselves comfortable.

01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:57.849
Or, uh, George, you could take
them for a walk, you know,

01:26:57.850 --> 01:26:59.709
while I get ready.

01:26:59.710 --> 01:27:02.279
Well, um, why don't you two
children go and play somewhere.

01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:06.380
And, uh, I'll stay here
and keep Nina company, eh?

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.009
You should tell her, George.

01:27:11.010 --> 01:27:13.599
You don't want to hurt Rodney,
I don't want to hurt Nina.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.549
I don't want to exclude Rodney.

01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:17.190
That's different.

01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:19.709
Are you trying to
tell me something?

01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:21.549
Because we could stop.

01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:22.549
No.

01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:26.119
I... ju... this isn't easy.

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:26.989
I promised.

01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:29.229
I promised her I'd
help her with the baby.

01:27:29.230 --> 01:27:30.029
That's great.

01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:31.009
Help her.

01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:31.949
You be the uncle.

01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:32.869
You be the godfather.

01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:34.629
Oh, you don't... no,
you don't understand.

01:27:34.630 --> 01:27:38.169
I'm more excited about this baby
than anything ever in my life.

01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:38.949
More than me?

01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:40.109
Oh, jeez, Paul.

01:27:40.110 --> 01:27:40.949
Don't make it that way.

01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:41.949
I'm not making it that way.

01:27:41.950 --> 01:27:42.650
You are.

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.740
I love you very much.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.289
You know, I think we're
both behaving rather

01:27:53.290 --> 01:27:55.239
well, under the circumstances.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:58.719
After all, it's not
always easy being

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.300
alone in the bedroom next door.

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.459
Next door to George and Paul?

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.679
You knew that.

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.009
Well, of course.

01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:11.539
Of course I knew that.

01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:12.709
I think Paul is great.

01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:14.399
I think he's just great.

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.300
Well, we're all great.

01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:20.899
You must think I'm
pretty peculiar.

01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:22.629
I have opinions
about Shakespeare.

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:25.299
About other people's lifestyles,
I have absolutely no opinions,

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.679
whatsoever.

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:30.139
And I don't think one should
be too hard on one's self.

01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:34.829
If the object one's
affection returns

01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:38.249
the favour with
rather less enthusiasm

01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:41.409
than one might have hoped.

01:28:41.410 --> 01:28:44.289
But a small
observation, if I may,

01:28:44.290 --> 01:28:46.929
from someone old enough
to be your grandfather.

01:28:46.930 --> 01:28:48.540
Oh, you're not that much older.

01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:53.399
Have you noticed that
you're the only woman coming

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.989
to your Thanksgiving dinner?

01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.889
Yes.

01:28:56.890 --> 01:28:58.789
And all my female friends,
they're either busy,

01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:59.589
or they have families.

01:28:59.590 --> 01:29:00.389
No don't get defensive.

01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:02.729
Have you also
noticed that you're

01:29:02.730 --> 01:29:04.609
the only practicing
heterosexual coming

01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:06.500
to your Thanksgiving dinner?

01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:13.749
Well, I, uh, I haven't
practised in a while.

01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:15.919
I'm serious.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:19.009
What happens when all the men
at your Thanksgiving dinner

01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:21.299
find other men?

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:22.770
Whose at your table then?

01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:29.919
Don't fix your life so that
you're left alone right when

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.080
you come to the middle of it.

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:46.659
Lord, for the erring thought,
not into evil wrought.

01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:50.819
Lord, for the wicked
will, betrayed and baffled

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:58.820
still, for the heart from itself
kept, our Thanksgiving accept.

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:03.159
Hm.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:06.329
To Nina and George, our
wonderful new friends.

01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:08.239
To Nina and George.

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:09.399
To friendship.

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:10.840
Yes, to friendship.

01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:30.739
Well, Paul, I think you and
I ought to be getting going.

01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:32.879
Well, actually,
I think I'm going

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.879
to hang out here for awhile.

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:36.090
Ah, well.

01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:41.399
That OK, Rod?

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:49.400
When would you be
getting... all right.

01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:08.179
Well, thank you for
including me in your holiday.

01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:09.349
Thank you for coming.

01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:10.369
Good night.

01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:11.070
Paul.

01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:14.810
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:17.789
George.

01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:18.649
Good night.

01:31:18.650 --> 01:31:20.099
Uh, could I walk
you out to the...

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:20.799
No, no.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:21.250
I'm fine.

01:31:21.250 --> 01:31:21.740
Thanks.

01:31:21.741 --> 01:31:22.439
You're sure?

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:24.199
Let me get that.

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.949
Sorry, thanks.

01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:26.649
Bye.

01:31:26.650 --> 01:31:27.429
Good night.

01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:28.120
Night, Rod.

01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:36.239
Uh, well, let's... let's get
cracking on these dishes.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.439
That's all right, I've got it.

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.420
I've got it, thank you.

01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:45.859
You sure?

01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:46.639
Yes, definitely.

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:47.340
Good night.

01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:58.730
Oh, thank you.

01:32:02.730 --> 01:32:07.929
Thank you, for absolutely
the best holiday.

01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:10.109
Hm.

01:32:10.110 --> 01:32:10.810
I love you.

01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:22.259
It was a wonderful
dinner, Nina.

01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:22.950
Thank you.

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:45.489
Nina, it's 3
o'clock in the morning.

01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:48.409
Oh, I'm sorry, did I wake you?

01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:50.329
No.

01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:51.919
Paul wanted some ice cream.

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:53.269
Oh, that's so sweet.

01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:54.570
You guys have so much in common.

01:32:57.450 --> 01:33:01.919
Paul thinks, uh,
you don't like him.

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.749
I don't know him.

01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:06.569
You seemed to like Rodney.

01:33:06.570 --> 01:33:09.539
Well, Rodney is a decent
and intelligent man,

01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:13.399
who is very hurt and insecure.

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.069
We're all very
hurt and insecure.

01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:16.829
Who do you know that isn't?

01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:18.109
Paul.

01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:21.909
Paul seems to be a
totally happy guy.

01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:22.609
You don't like him.

01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:24.129
Oh, what the hell
difference does it make

01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:26.699
if I like Paul or not, George?

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:28.379
You like Paul, and
that's what's important.

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:29.199
And that's great.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:30.849
I mean that's just great.

01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:32.239
I've just finished my work.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.969
Nina, I slept for
months in this apartment

01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:36.099
with you and Vince right there.

01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:36.979
That is different!

01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:37.749
How is that different?

01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:39.379
Because you don't tell
a woman that you love her

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:42.169
and then two days later bring
Romeo home to sleep with you.

01:33:42.170 --> 01:33:43.009
You invited him.

01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.929
Yes, for dinner.

01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:45.419
And I invited Rodney, too.

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:46.749
I thought they were a couple.

01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:48.039
Oh, come on, you
didn't think that.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:50.709
Well, you didn't
tell me otherwise.

01:33:50.710 --> 01:33:53.679
Ugh!

01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:55.859
Nina, look at me.

01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.269
Nina, look at... Nina!

01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.969
Look at me!

01:33:57.970 --> 01:33:58.330
What?

01:33:58.331 --> 01:33:59.929
I thought we were going
to make up new rules.

01:33:59.930 --> 01:34:01.959
Yeah, well, they have
to work for both of us.

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:02.659
So what you saying?

01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:04.129
You can have a man in
your bed, but I can't?

01:34:04.130 --> 01:34:04.829
Oh, god!

01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:05.599
No, no!

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:06.299
You can't.

01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:08.229
You cannot have me and
Paul and this baby.

01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:08.929
Why?

01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:11.079
Because you deserve to
have it all and I don't?

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:11.819
Oh!

01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:13.849
It's not about having it all.

01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:16.929
It is about picking one
person and making it work.

01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:19.459
And when you are fucking
a man in the next room,

01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:21.109
it makes it pretty clear
the person you don't

01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:22.259
want to make it work with me.

01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:23.259
And that's... that's bullshit.

01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:24.500
Oh, fuck off, George!

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.650
You forgot Paul's ice cream!

01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:00.829
Caroline, let's face it.

01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:03.339
My little brother is cute.

01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:04.839
And if you can deal with
the 20 women waiting

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.579
outside with pistols,
I think this union

01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:08.680
will succeed brilliantly.

01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:18.579
My friend, Nina, the
wisest person I know

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:22.309
said to me yesterday, you
have to pick one person

01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:23.260
and make it work.

01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:32.419
Frank, I think you picked
absolutely the right person.

01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:33.820
Aw, that's so sweet.

01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:37.310
I'd like to propose a toast.

01:35:40.930 --> 01:35:44.589
To the doctors, Frank and
Caroline Colucci-Hanson.

01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:47.560
Here, here!

01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:57.229
Your husband is adorable.

01:35:57.230 --> 01:36:00.050
I can't imagine my husband
still calling me his friend.

01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:14.989
Life was a song,
you came along, I've laid

01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:19.969
awake the whole night through.

01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:26.449
If I ever dared to
think you cared,

01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:32.919
this is what I'd say to you.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:39.399
You were meant for me.

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:42.880
I was meant for you.

01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:51.849
Nature patterned you
and when she was done,

01:36:51.850 --> 01:36:57.319
you were all the sweet
things rolled up in one.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:05.320
You're like a plaintive melody
that never lets me free.

01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:14.259
For I'm content.

01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:18.239
The angels must have sent you.

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:22.720
And they meant you just for me.

01:37:59.570 --> 01:38:01.579
Very nicely done.

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:02.860
George, I got to
get out of here.

01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:10.669
You OK?

01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:13.149
Yeah, I'm OK.

01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:15.419
Are you sure?

01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:18.009
Yeah, I just had
to get out of there.

01:38:18.010 --> 01:38:19.749
Oh, I know.

01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:20.970
Weddings can be a little much.

01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:27.850
But it works.

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.140
What do you mean?

01:38:40.130 --> 01:38:42.150
I was watching Frank
and Caroline today.

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:50.460
And I just kept
thinking, this is real.

01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:55.480
And George and I are not.

01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:07.270
We're just different.

01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:12.550
But I don't think that
I am that different.

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.240
I want you to be with me.

01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:26.159
I want you to marry me.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:29.450
I want you to love me
the way that I love you.

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:35.160
I don't really want a
see who you are, at all.

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:48.969
I think you see me.

01:39:48.970 --> 01:39:51.539
Well, then tell me the truth.

01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:53.030
What do you want?

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.420
I want Paul.

01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:13.169
I don't want to be
able to look at you

01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:15.230
and not feel so hurt by you.

01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:22.709
I'm so sorry.

01:40:22.710 --> 01:40:26.519
The last person in the world
I'd want to hurt is you.

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.419
I know that.

01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:29.849
I know.

01:40:29.850 --> 01:40:31.990
Can't choose who you love.

01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:37.129
I think Paul was the best
thing that ever happened to us,

01:40:37.130 --> 01:40:37.829
you know?

01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:41.129
At least he got us
to tell the truth.

01:40:41.130 --> 01:40:42.740
But, hon, I don't
want to lose you.

01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:47.620
I can't let things
stay the same.

01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:57.369
Thank you.

01:40:57.370 --> 01:40:58.369
Take care, man.

01:40:58.370 --> 01:40:59.669
Congratulations, buddy.

01:40:59.670 --> 01:41:00.370
Way to go.

01:41:07.670 --> 01:41:08.369
Hey.

01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:09.369
I'm sorry.

01:41:09.370 --> 01:41:11.369
I got here as fast as I could.

01:41:11.370 --> 01:41:12.869
No, it's OK.

01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:14.369
George was with
me the whole time.

01:41:14.370 --> 01:41:16.869
Good.

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:18.459
This is Molly.

01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:20.999
Oh, hello, Molly.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.769
I'm you're dad.

01:41:23.770 --> 01:41:25.119
Yeah.

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.709
Shh, shh, shh.

01:41:26.710 --> 01:41:27.759
Molly, Molly.

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:28.529
Hush, hush, hush.

01:41:28.530 --> 01:41:29.229
It's OK.

01:41:29.230 --> 01:41:30.209
I got her.

01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:31.139
It's OK.

01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:31.839
It's OK.

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:33.239
I got her.

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:36.899
Look for the Union labels,

01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:41.449
when you are buying a
cook dress or blouse.

01:41:41.450 --> 01:41:42.649
Remember somewhere...

01:41:42.650 --> 01:41:43.719
Which one of you is the father?

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.819
The Union sewing.

01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:47.949
Vince McBride is the father.

01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:48.779
Can you come with me?

01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:50.009
We have some paperwork for you.

01:41:50.010 --> 01:41:50.709
Yeah, yeah.

01:41:50.710 --> 01:41:51.409
Yeah, sure.

01:41:51.410 --> 01:41:52.109
Here.

01:41:52.110 --> 01:41:54.469
Hey, you be nice to
your mother, honey.

01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:56.889
Here we go.

01:41:56.890 --> 01:41:57.860
There she is.

01:41:58.620 --> 01:41:59.310
Hi.

01:42:05.610 --> 01:42:09.909
I wonder if Madame Reynolds
has ballroom dancing for babies?

01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:11.339
Are you kidding?

01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:13.249
Come here, Molly.

01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:15.410
Let's show Mommy
your dancing legs.

01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:25.250
You were meant for me.

01:42:28.690 --> 01:42:35.339
And I was meant for you.

01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:39.999
George, when were you
planning on moving out?

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:40.700
I don't know.

01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:46.110
I think you should
before I get home.

01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:51.999
Well, are... are... are you sure?

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.519
I can stay until you
and Molly get settled.

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.379
No, I don't want you there.

01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:59.839
We'll be fine.

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.860
It's time for Molly and me
to get on with our lives.

01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:11.229
I'll speak to Paul.

01:43:11.230 --> 01:43:11.930
Thank you.

01:43:17.630 --> 01:43:23.199
You're a very lucky
girl, Molly McBride Borowski.

01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:25.130
You have the world,
the best mum.

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.509
Bye, Nina.

01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:35.480
Bye, George.

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.220
Head up, young person.

01:44:00.330 --> 01:44:01.609
Hi.

01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:02.310
Hi, Molly.

01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:08.230
I love you.

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:17.109
Hello, I'm George Hanson,
Principle of the Prospect.

01:44:17.110 --> 01:44:18.589
Park Cooperative School.

01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:21.780
We want to welcome you to
our annual Music Celebration!

01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:25.760
And now on with the show!

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:29.749
Listen as your
day unfolds challenge

01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:31.739
what your future holds.

01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:37.219
Try to keep your
head up to the sky.

01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:39.709
People they may cause you tears.

01:44:39.710 --> 01:44:42.199
Go ahead, release your fears.

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:47.679
Stand up and be counted,
don't be ashamed to cry.

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.660
You got to be, you got to
be bad, you got to be...

01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:52.659
Go, Molly!

01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:56.139
You gotta be
hard, you gotta be tough,

01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:58.129
you gotta be stronger.

01:44:58.130 --> 01:45:03.609
You gotta cool, you gotta be
calm, you gotta stay together.

01:45:03.610 --> 01:45:08.589
All I know, all I know,
love will save the day.

01:45:08.590 --> 01:45:12.079
Herald what your mother
said, reading the books

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.069
your father read,
try to solve the...

01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:15.069
Come on, Molly!

01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:18.049
Go, Molly!

01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:21.539
Some may
have more cash than you.

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:27.809
Others take a different
view, my, oh my, hey, hey.

01:45:27.810 --> 01:45:28.509
You go girl!

01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:30.500
You go, honey!

01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:33.289
Yeah!

01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:33.990
Yeah!

01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:41.079
I got to go.
I have an audition.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.349
Well, what time you
going to be home?

01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:43.379
Right after yoga.

01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:44.759
Look, are you sure
you don't mind?

01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:46.379
You had me over last Saturday.

01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:48.269
Oh, hey, Rodney,
you're family, man.

01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:49.169
Yeah.

01:45:49.170 --> 01:45:51.759
Constance, why can't
I get a ring in my nose?

01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:52.839
Sally, get straight inside.

01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:54.229
This is a very
bad neighbourhood.

01:45:54.230 --> 01:45:55.529
This is a fucking
great neighbourhood.

01:45:55.530 --> 01:45:57.039
And my name is not
Constance, it's mother.

01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:58.609
What is this with the
fucking all of a sudden?

01:45:58.610 --> 01:46:00.359
Nina, don't forget
dinner Thursday.

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:01.869
Umberto Eco and Sharon
Stone are coming.

01:46:01.870 --> 01:46:02.569
Oh, goody.

01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:04.269
I got a bidding war going
for Sharon's memoirs.

01:46:04.270 --> 01:46:04.969
She's great.

01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:06.059
You'd love her.
Goodbye, Louis.

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:06.789
Good to see you again.

01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:10.009
Nina, just a second.

01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:11.779
There's someone who's
coming I want you to meet.

01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:12.479
So...

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:13.179
Why?

01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:13.959
I am with Louis.

01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:15.689
Sweetie, you've
made your point.

01:46:15.690 --> 01:46:16.929
It's time to move on.

01:46:16.930 --> 01:46:17.629
Get your hair cut.

01:46:17.630 --> 01:46:18.379
Sidney.

01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:19.079
Sidney.

01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:19.520
What?

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:19.960
Let's go.

01:46:19.961 --> 01:46:20.799
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:21.739
Great.

01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:23.929
Molly, you were great!

01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:24.629
Perfect!

01:46:24.630 --> 01:46:25.479
I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.919
You were just ter...
I love that hat.

01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:29.129
Can I give you a ride?

01:46:29.130 --> 01:46:29.829
No.

01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:31.559
I'm not going to
use taxpayer dollars

01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.839
to fund my personal
transportation, Louis.

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.899
Uh, I'll take the
subway, thank you.

01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:38.569
Oh, well, suit yourself, Vince.

01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:39.859
I will see you at home.

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:40.559
Bye, Molly.

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:41.359
Great job.

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:42.129
Bye, Louis.

01:46:42.130 --> 01:46:42.829
Bye, bye.

01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:44.289
Bye, Louis.

01:46:44.290 --> 01:46:48.199
Nina, I am the only man in your
life who ever made any sense.

01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:48.959
You know that, right?

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:49.659
I do know that.

01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:51.119
Mm, OK.

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:52.589
Bye bye, sweetheart.

01:46:52.590 --> 01:46:53.559
Bye, Daddy.

01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:55.529
I love you.

01:46:55.530 --> 01:46:58.909
George, great show.

01:46:58.910 --> 01:47:01.249
Love your work.

01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:02.379
Oh, hey, do you
guys want to come

01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:03.769
over for dinner Saturday night?

01:47:03.770 --> 01:47:04.469
Rodney's coming.

01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:05.559
Yeah, that sounds great.

01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:06.560
I'll ask Paul.

01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:11.029
Uncle George, I had more
people come see me than anyone.

01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:14.179
I had Mommy and Daddy
and Louis and Uncle.

01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:15.689
Roddy and Uncle Sidney and...

01:47:15.690 --> 01:47:17.189
Honey, you are just the
luckiest little girl.

01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:20.009
Yeah, and if you ever need any
advise ask Auntie Constance.

01:47:20.010 --> 01:47:20.979
She knows everything.

01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:22.340
Oh, stop it.

01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:33.609
Hey, do you want to
grab some coffee?

01:47:33.610 --> 01:47:34.309
Yeah.

01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:35.679
You guys always go for coffee.

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.499
All you do is talk.

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.939
Well, excuse me,
but we like talking.

01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:40.639
Yeah.

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:43.289
You know, Nina, did you ever
just want to touch her nose?

01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:44.779
It's just like a little tulip.

01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:45.889
Don't you dare start with her.

01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:47.379
It looks nothing like a tulip.

01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:48.859
Come on.

01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:51.330
Mommy, I can do George's show.

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:53.799
You can?

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.569
Really?

01:47:55.570 --> 01:47:56.269
Yep.

01:47:56.270 --> 01:48:04.170
