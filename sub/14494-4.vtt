headache of her life.

04:35.202 --> 04:37.579
Have you no honor?

04:37.685 --> 04:39.488
Not even a little.

04:39.522 --> 04:40.927
Then you should be familiar

04:40.953 --> 04:43.392
with attacking a foe
from behind.

04:43.426 --> 04:44.693
Huh?

[groans]

04:52.497 --> 04:53.563
Thank you.

04:53.597 --> 04:56.929
You have no powers,
no armor, no weapons

04:57.016 --> 04:59.782
and yet I saw you risk
your life to help the wounded.

04:59.816 --> 05:01.050
Why?

05:01.084 --> 05:04.553
Because they needed my help,
so I helped them.

05:04.773 --> 05:06.742
I'm a paramedic.
It's what I do.

I bear a grim message
from thy father Odin.

05:17.910 --> 05:21.262
He calls you home.
Asgard is under siege.

05:22.731 --> 05:26.736
Fare thee well, Jane Foster.

05:28.673 --> 05:29.706

Do not stop until the throne

protect the Bifrost Bridge.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.685
Worry not, Heimdall.

11:04.528 --> 11:07.700

Frost Giants.

11:07.735 --> 11:10.436
Now, you shall feel mine!

11:12.642 --> 11:13.907
For Asgard!

11:42.502 --> 11:44.171
Welcome home,

brother.

11:48.300 --> 11:51.550
[groans]

11:51.584 --> 11:55.834
You've had this coming
for a long time, of course.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.738
But you know this.

11:59.341 --> 12:01.023
[screams]

12:13.880 --> 12:17.553
You and Odin
deserve what's coming.

12:17.697 --> 12:21.261
I do not wish
to fight you, Loki.

12:21.301 --> 12:24.605
Once we were brothers.
We were friends.

12:24.765 --> 12:26.763
we fought side by side,

12:26.790 --> 12:29.013
the sons of Odin, together.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.883
It could be that way again!

12:31.913 --> 12:34.715
You made your choice, Thor.

12:34.750 --> 12:37.343
Always the dutiful son.

12:37.385 --> 12:41.621
You chose to remain
blind to Odin's lies.

12:41.997 --> 12:45.668
And for that choice,
you will suffer.

12:49.407 --> 12:51.410
To me, Mjolnir.

13:06.863 --> 13:08.333
[strains]

13:33.723 --> 13:35.323
[insects chirp]

13:41.120 --> 13:43.376
You can not bet me, brother.

13:43.428 --> 13:46.394
You never could.

13:46.588 --> 13:48.922
Things change.

13:48.956 --> 13:50.190
[screams]

13:53.492 --> 13:55.095
Surrender, brother.

13:55.129 --> 13:57.050
It need not be this way.

13:57.090 --> 13:59.600
I think it does.

14:03.266 --> 14:05.482
So noble.

14:05.802 --> 14:07.235
So brave.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.374
So gullible.

14:11.497 --> 14:13.141
Come, brother,

14:13.175 --> 14:15.684
you have much to answer for.

14:18.435 --> 14:20.948
[crow caws]

14:25.258 --> 14:28.449
You have go too far, Loki.

14:28.636 --> 14:30.505
This is no game.

14:30.539 --> 14:32.735
Soon I shall enter
the Odin's sleep

14:32.768 --> 14:35.710
and Asgard will not have
my power to protect it.

14:35.884 --> 14:38.075
To bring the Frost Giants here,

14:38.115 --> 14:40.415
to try to usurp
your own father.

14:40.620 --> 14:43.184
You are not my father.

14:43.488 --> 14:47.373
Look at you, king of fools.
Of arrogance.

14:47.408 --> 14:49.949
Of weakness and betrayal.

14:50.128 --> 14:51.742
Asgard will fall,

14:51.799 --> 14:55.196
and I will be there
to laugh in its ruins.

14:55.238 --> 14:58.738
To see you and Thor in chains.

14:58.849 --> 15:00.110
Enough!

15:00.127 --> 15:02.546
You leave me no choice, Loki.

15:02.772 --> 15:05.380
You are hereby banished
to the Isle of Silence,

15:05.661 --> 15:08.927
where no one will have
to suffer your lies
and deception.

15:09.179 --> 15:10.085
No.

15:13.365 --> 15:15.056
No!

15:28.176 --> 15:30.491
[no audible sound]

15:34.171 --> 15:36.740
[no audible sound]

15:47.680 --> 15:50.144
Father.

15:50.178 --> 15:52.046
The Odin sleep nears.

15:52.748 --> 15:56.584
Once a year, I must slumber
to regain my strength

15:56.765 --> 15:59.687
so that Asgard can live.

15:59.722 --> 16:02.323
There is much
for you to prepare.

16:02.358 --> 16:05.935
Balder and Sif will watch
over Asgard while you sleep.

16:06.017 --> 16:08.196
I must attend to Midgard

16:10.649 --> 16:13.137
You need to be here.

16:13.170 --> 16:15.582
You need to be here.
Asgard is your responsibility,

16:15.657 --> 16:17.109
not Midgard.

16:17.401 --> 16:19.767
The mortals need me, Father.

16:19.804 --> 16:23.334
I return to Midgard again
and again because their world

16:23.367 --> 16:26.974
is spawning dangers that mankind
has never seen before.

16:27.008 --> 16:31.045
Evil that will consume them,
unless I am there to stop it.

16:31.470 --> 16:34.040
Bald tells me the humans
are more capable

16:34.075 --> 16:36.109
than you give them credit for.

16:36.143 --> 16:39.179
You saw the valor
in the human Jane Foster.

16:39.531 --> 16:42.519
And of course
you were watching me.

16:42.694 --> 16:45.285
I will always be here
to protect Asgard,

16:45.319 --> 16:47.585
but I will not play this game.

16:47.893 --> 16:50.005
Loki is not wrong, Father.

16:50.131 --> 16:51.961
You toy with us all.

16:51.995 --> 16:53.723
Telling us whatever
you need to in order

16:53.744 --> 16:55.582
to keep us under your heel.

16:55.673 --> 16:58.930
You could have stopped Loki's
attack before it started.

16:59.042 --> 17:00.421
Enough.

17:00.490 --> 17:03.189
You dare defy me?

17:03.224 --> 17:06.760
Should Asgard be threatened,
I will be here.

17:07.097 --> 17:11.097
But, until then, I chose Earth.

17:44.739 --> 17:48.308
Father, you don't understand.

17:49.023 --> 17:50.755
I--

17:50.786 --> 17:54.691
No, I am needed on Earth.

17:58.965 --> 17:59.997
[grunts]

18:39.205 --> 18:41.376
You are in great danger.

18:41.683 --> 18:43.744
They threaten
your very existence.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.015
I have seen it!

18:45.048 --> 18:48.836
The Asgardians are planning to wage
war on the Frost Giants.

18:48.996 --> 18:51.808
Even now, they ready
their armies.

18:51.941 --> 18:54.828
Soon they will move
to destroy you all.

18:54.962 --> 18:56.345
[all cheer]

18:58.100 --> 19:01.000
Odin would wipe you all away,

19:01.034 --> 19:03.933
but I stand against him.

19:03.971 --> 19:08.473
Join me, and we will strike
at the heart of Asgard.

19:08.540 --> 19:12.178
And what of the Thunderer?
What of Thor?

19:12.909 --> 19:16.541
Let me worry about
my step-brother.

19:16.898 --> 19:19.318
Now, who is with me?

19:19.376 --> 19:23.305
[all cheer]

19:30.496 --> 19:32.667
The shipment arrives in New York City...

19:32.699 --> 19:38.170
tomorrow morning, onboard a Stark
Industries freighter.

19:38.874 --> 19:40.376
Bring it to me.

19:40.411 --> 19:43.313
You got it, boss.

19:56.720 --> 20:00.221
[Woman] Thor!
Please, you have to help.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.526
What troubles you?

20:05.560 --> 20:07.962
It's horrible.
People are being hurt.

20:07.996 --> 20:10.631
The police at the docks,
they're under attack.

20:10.821 --> 20:12.131
Thor, they need you.

20:12.222 --> 20:13.700
Fear not, mortal.

20:14.189 --> 20:16.462
I will save them.

20:35.298 --> 20:36.296
It is done.

20:36.330 --> 20:37.764
He believed me.

20:37.799 --> 20:41.813
<i>Of course, he did,
my beautiful enchantress.</i>

20:42.988 --> 20:45.784
<i>He always believes you.</i>

20:53.216 --> 20:57.383
His behavior is troubling,
Allfather.

20:57.417 --> 21:01.487
His actions on Midgard
are disheartening.

21:01.521 --> 21:04.357
He-- My lord.

21:04.518 --> 21:06.492
Continue, noble Balder.

21:07.111 --> 21:09.428
His arrogance is growing.

21:09.488 --> 21:12.585
He treats the mortals
like children.

21:12.658 --> 21:16.228
And I have discovered
the reason he neglects Asgard.

21:16.262 --> 21:18.030
Tell me.

21:18.064 --> 21:20.868
It is possible that
he stays on Midgard

21:21.118 --> 21:23.836
because a mortal
has caught his eye.

21:24.348 --> 21:28.073
A mortal called Jane Foster.

21:28.107 --> 21:29.675
Mmm.

22:02.512 --> 22:03.543
[clears throat]

22:03.577 --> 22:06.770
Did you miss the sound
of your own voice?

22:07.311 --> 22:09.328
How drone?

22:09.401 --> 22:10.536
Tell me.

22:10.763 --> 22:13.433
All transpires as you planned.

22:13.733 --> 22:18.872
Neither Thor nor Odin is
aware of what is happening.

22:18.977 --> 22:20.907
Of course they're not.

22:20.941 --> 22:23.476
It is my plan, after all.

22:24.124 --> 22:28.738
No one is ready
for what comes next.

22:29.119 --> 22:31.384
[laughs]

22:32.305 --> 22:38.866
