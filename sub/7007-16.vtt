<i>Welcome to Tool Time on location.
Here we are in Tim's very own backyard.</i>

00:05.338 --> 00:09.399
It's Storm Watch '98!

00:18.485 --> 00:20.715
Hi. I am Tim "The Weatherman" Taylor.

00:20.787 --> 00:24.348
And of course, you all know
my assistant, Al "NiÃ±o" Borland.

00:25.325 --> 00:27.088
That's right.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.220
We're here to show you how
to protect your house and property

00:30.296 --> 00:33.356
from the ravages of a winter storm.

00:39.506 --> 00:42.998
It's gonna be a long winter.
Al's mom saw her shadow.

00:44.544 --> 00:48.674
Which is hard to do because she can't
see her feet at this point, can she?

00:48.748 --> 00:51.911
And later in the week,
we expect a huge storm to hit our area.

00:51.985 --> 00:55.443
There's a cold front
cruising across the Great Plains.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.082
Gonna collide with a northeaster
out of the southwest,

00:58.191 --> 01:00.318
causing precipitous weather.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.556
And a small-craft advisory.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.656
In other words, it's going to be windy.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.565
Now, a storm can be devastating.

01:09.636 --> 01:12.662
But there are precautions
you can use to protect property.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.264
Right. Especially those
living along the lakes.

01:15.341 --> 01:18.435
Tie down and secure anything
that might cause some damage.

01:18.511 --> 01:20.411
The first thing...

01:23.483 --> 01:27.943
Ha ha ha ha.
Gee, Al, funny as always.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.650
All right, we've already had
a very bad ice storm.

01:32.725 --> 01:36.559
What we want to do now to prevent
further damage is prune these trees.

01:36.629 --> 01:40.258
That's right. You want to cut back
any rotting or dead wood.

01:40.333 --> 01:44.099
Right. Or you can recycle that dead wood
and build yourself an assistant.

01:46.139 --> 01:49.802
Now in some areas the wind is going
to get as high as 60 miles per hour.

01:49.876 --> 01:53.835
It's a good idea to protect your windows
by three-quarter-inch plywood.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.380
Hey, guys!

01:55.448 --> 01:59.214
Holy moly, guys! You oughta see
this branch near Wilsors house.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.583
It's a disaster waiting to happen.

02:01.654 --> 02:05.112
It's got, uh, stress cracks in it.
Big ones...

02:05.191 --> 02:06.920
Very, uh...

02:06.993 --> 02:09.757
...very similar to the ones
I got on this branch here.

02:14.534 --> 02:16.559
Tim, are you OK?

02:19.706 --> 02:22.675
We'll be right back
with some gazebo repair tips.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.752
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yes, Al.

03:14.827 --> 03:17.853
A big splinter in my butt broke my fall.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.229
Well, here. Let me give you
a hand with that.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.461
Oh, I guess we'll just...

03:22.535 --> 03:25.868
- Well, hey! What's this?
- What's what, Al?

03:25.939 --> 03:29.898
Looks like oregano. Does Jill
keep it out here so it stays fresh?

03:31.511 --> 03:33.138
Let me see that.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.846
- It's not oregano.
- Tarragon?

03:40.453 --> 03:44.014
- This is marijuana.
- Jill cooks with marijuana?!

03:47.393 --> 03:50.885
No, you idiot.
Somebody's hiding this out here.

03:52.532 --> 03:55.763
Oh... I can't believe
I touched this bag!

03:55.835 --> 03:58.133
Oh, now my prints are all over it!

03:58.204 --> 04:01.071
- Oh, man!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Calm down!

04:01.140 --> 04:02.801
This makes me an accessory.

04:02.875 --> 04:06.834
I could be charged with...
with possession of illicit drugs!

04:07.413 --> 04:10.143
Al, Al, Al, stop, stop!
Think for a minute.

04:10.216 --> 04:14.346
You found marijuana on my property.
What does that tell you?

04:14.420 --> 04:17.355
I can no longer run
for political office.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.761
Yeah. Bye.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.891
Look what I found.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.258
This is a joke, right?
Is this what I think it is?

04:30.336 --> 04:32.964
It was taped to the underside
of the seat out there.

04:33.039 --> 04:35.803
- Oh, my God! It's marijuana.
- That's right.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.433
Do you think that
this belongs to one of our boys?

04:38.511 --> 04:41.776
Well, not unless we have a chipmunk
that has glaucoma.

04:41.848 --> 04:44.510
You never know!
There's other possible explanations.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.950
Could be one of your crew.
They could've hid it.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.181
My crew doesn't smoke pot!

04:49.289 --> 04:53.623
<i>You can't be high when you do a show
like Tool Time. Look at the quality...</i>

04:53.693 --> 04:55.661
...precision.

04:55.728 --> 04:57.958
We gotta face this. This is our kids.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.499
I know. You're probably right.
Oh, God! Oh, God!

05:00.566 --> 05:03.091
OK, just stay calm.
We gotta think about this.

05:03.169 --> 05:05.694
Which one is it?

05:05.772 --> 05:09.731
- Has any of them been acting strange?
- All of them.

05:09.809 --> 05:13.336
Have you noticed anybody
eating any more than usual?

05:13.413 --> 05:16.473
- All of them.
- What about smelling funny?

05:16.549 --> 05:18.710
All of them.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.549
Well, this is it.
They've formed a can'tel.

05:22.455 --> 05:26.687
When they get home from school, we'll
just have to sit them down and ask them.

05:26.759 --> 05:30.490
They're not gonna come clean. It'll
drive the user further underground.

05:30.563 --> 05:33.327
- We may never find out who's using.
- What should we do?

05:33.433 --> 05:35.264
- We gotta trap them.
- Trap them?

05:35.335 --> 05:39.101
It's Friday night. Whoever owns this
is gonna want it for the weekend.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.608
My guys fix the seat. I put it back.
We go to Wilsors house.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.041
We watch the guilty party
come and nab him.

05:45.144 --> 05:48.580
I don't know. I don't like the idea
of spying on my own children.

05:48.648 --> 05:51.208
There's your mistake,
thinking of them as children.

05:51.284 --> 05:54.185
If we love them, we gotta think of them
as potential felons.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.589
Don't call my babies "felons."

05:57.657 --> 06:00.524
I said "potential felons."

06:00.593 --> 06:02.356
Let me try the stakeout, please?

06:02.462 --> 06:05.727
All right. If this doesn't work,
we're gonna be honest with them.

06:05.798 --> 06:09.131
- And what if that doesn't work?
- We grill them, shake them down.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.762
Eventually one of them will crack.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.931
Don't say "crack."

06:36.796 --> 06:41.256
- I don't believe this.
- I don't either. It's ten degrees here.

06:41.334 --> 06:44.303
No, no. Brad is picking
his fingernail with a fork.

06:46.305 --> 06:49.206
- That's disgusting.
- No, this is really disgusting.

06:49.275 --> 06:52.608
- He put the fork back in the drawer.
- Gross!

06:52.678 --> 06:55.738
- Here's some hot chocolate.
- Oh, thank you, Wilson.

06:57.049 --> 07:00.815
You're out here all the time. Ever see
the kids do anything suspicious?

07:00.920 --> 07:02.478
I haven't ever seen a thing.

07:02.588 --> 07:06.217
I find it hard to believe any of the
boys would experiment with cannabis.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.988
My boys aren't flesh eaters.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.493
I just don't get it.

07:12.565 --> 07:16.194
We have been so much more open
with them than our parents were with us.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.760
- We communicated with them.
- We respected them.

07:18.838 --> 07:21.102
Where did we go wrong?

07:22.775 --> 07:24.402
Hello?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.739
Remember the dad?

07:29.182 --> 07:33.312
I'm sorry, Tim, just sometimes I tend
to think of your children as my own.

07:34.053 --> 07:37.887
We should've prepared them better,
shared more of our concerns about drugs.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.425
- Mmm.
- We shared up the yin-yang!

07:40.493 --> 07:43.257
We should've been tougher on them!

07:43.362 --> 07:46.388
If it were up to you,
we'd never let them out of their rooms.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.560
That's right. A couple of good,
substantial police locks,

07:49.635 --> 07:53.093
hungry rottweilers sitting out there.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.905
I've read about kids and drugs.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.934
But it never really hit home
until it happened in my own backyard.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.673
It's ironic, isn't it?

08:01.747 --> 08:04.079
First we rebel
against the authority figure.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.608
- Then we are the authority figure.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

08:07.687 --> 08:11.453
- Our dope fiend is making his move.
- Which one is it?

08:13.326 --> 08:15.954
- It's Brad.
- No, not Brad.

08:16.028 --> 08:20.260
That's right. He's making his move.
He's going for... his coat.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.631
I knew it couldn't be
our first-born.

08:25.705 --> 08:28.731
It's been two hours. I'm freezing.
I want to go inside.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.776
Hold on... wait, wait, wait!

08:30.843 --> 08:32.538
- What?
- Randy.

08:32.611 --> 08:35.547
Walking through the living room,
opening the yard door.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.275
Not sweet little Randy.

08:37.350 --> 08:41.081
Don't let baby face fool you. He's got
"pothead" written all over his face.

08:41.821 --> 08:44.881
- He's reaching to pick up something.
- The drugs?

08:44.957 --> 08:47.926
- No. It's his boots.
- I knew it wasrt him.

08:47.994 --> 08:50.690
He's going back inside.

08:50.763 --> 08:52.424
Ronnie just walked in!

08:52.498 --> 08:54.625
- Ronnie?
- Mark's friend.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.931
Mark didn't say anything about
Ronnie coming over. That's weird.

08:58.004 --> 09:02.737
Oh, my God, that's it. The drugs belong
to Ronnie. He's just hiding them here.

09:02.808 --> 09:06.437
What a little jerk! Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. This is great!

09:06.512 --> 09:09.879
We're not the lousy parents.
The lousy parents belong to Ronnie!

09:12.018 --> 09:15.181
Well, even if it's Ronnie's pot,
Mark could be smoking it.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.984
Oh, that's true.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.890
Thanks a lot. I get my hopes up,
you gotta crush 'em.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.723
Why do you have to be such a downer?

09:23.863 --> 09:26.627
Don't say "downer."

09:41.547 --> 09:43.014
Tim?

09:43.082 --> 09:44.947
Tim?

09:45.017 --> 09:46.746
Tim!

09:46.819 --> 09:49.845
- What?
- Honey, I've had it.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.823
Nobody's making a move for the pot.

09:52.892 --> 09:56.726
I'm freezing. You're falling asleep.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.661
Give me 15 more minutes.

09:58.731 --> 10:01.199
- OK, 15 more.
- Yeah.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.326
But not a second more than that.

10:03.402 --> 10:06.565
You know, I'm gonna go out to the car
and get a thermal blanket.

10:29.028 --> 10:31.292
Tim!

10:31.397 --> 10:33.262
Tim!

10:40.473 --> 10:42.941
Well, what do you
have to say for yourself?

10:43.009 --> 10:45.341
It's not mine.
I was holding it for somebody.

10:45.411 --> 10:47.572
- Who?
- You don't know him.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.240
Well, I'd like to know him.
What's his phone number?

10:50.883 --> 10:53.579
He just moved in.
I don't even think he has a phone yet.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.417
Just get in there.
Get inside. Come on.

10:56.522 --> 11:00.049
- I thought you guys were going out.
- That's what we wanted you to think.

11:00.126 --> 11:02.390
We were over in Wilsors yard hiding.

11:02.461 --> 11:06.158
You set a trap for me? That really shows
you have a lot of trust in your child.

11:08.567 --> 11:12.003
We catch you with drugs
and you want to talk about trust?

11:12.071 --> 11:15.234
Well, you raise a good point.

11:16.942 --> 11:18.102
Sit.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.805
I told you guys I was just
holding it for somebody else.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.780
Do you think
we're a bunch of idiots?

11:22.848 --> 11:26.807
You want us to believe you're
in the marijuana-storage business?

11:27.620 --> 11:30.987
- Is this your dope, or not?
- The truth.

11:31.991 --> 11:36.121
It's mine. I came to pick it up after
the game and take it to a party.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.631
- Well, now you're a supplier.
- No, Dad. A lot of kids bring stuff.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.327
What is it? A "pot luck"?

11:46.072 --> 11:49.007
- Is this the only drug you're doing?
- Yes.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.838
- How much are you smoking?
- Not much.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.276
- Once a week? Once a month?
- When I go to parties.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.506
To kick back and mellow out
once in a while.

11:55.614 --> 11:58.583
I see. So you kick back
and mellow out to your car,

11:58.684 --> 12:02.245
get behind the wheel, and mellow
yourself right into a telephone pole?

12:02.354 --> 12:04.219
You managed to do that once straight.

12:04.290 --> 12:08.056
- Or were you straight then?
- I don't get high and drive.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.129
You were going to drive tonight.

12:12.031 --> 12:15.000
Don't you guys think you're making
a big deal out of this?

12:15.067 --> 12:17.729
If it wasrt a big deal,
why were you hiding it?

12:17.803 --> 12:20.431
- Because I knew you'd freak!
- Why do you think?

12:20.506 --> 12:22.736
Because what you're doing
is illegal here!

12:22.808 --> 12:25.368
Don't you think you're being
a little hypocritical?

12:26.212 --> 12:28.271
Well, why don't you explain that to me?

12:28.347 --> 12:30.508
You were alive
during the "hippie thing."

12:30.616 --> 12:33.278
Are you telling me
you never smoked weed?

12:33.352 --> 12:36.082
Don't turn this around.
This is not about us.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.725
This is about you.

12:39.825 --> 12:42.259
And... And you're grounded right now

12:42.328 --> 12:45.661
until we can figure out what to do
about this. Now get up to your room!

12:46.932 --> 12:48.900
- Fine.
- Fine.

12:51.437 --> 12:55.601
I don't believe that stuff.
Pulls this and says I'm a hypocrite.

12:55.674 --> 12:59.508
Well, he's right, at least about me.
I used to smoke a lot of dope.

12:59.578 --> 13:02.308
You don't tell him about that!

13:02.381 --> 13:06.112
It was a long time ago when you were in
college. This stuff's is stronger now.

13:06.185 --> 13:08.346
It was still illegal then.

13:08.420 --> 13:10.650
- I should've talked to Brad before.
- No!

13:10.723 --> 13:12.953
He could have benefitted
from my mistakes!

13:13.025 --> 13:15.960
You telling him that you smoked pot,
it's like endorsing it.

13:16.028 --> 13:19.361
He doesn't need my endorsement.
He's already doing it.

13:19.431 --> 13:23.128
OK. OK. Tell him the truth
about everything now.

13:23.202 --> 13:27.070
How about the first time we had sex?
Huh? Rusty's barn dance?

13:27.139 --> 13:28.470
<i>* Bum bum bum-bum bum bum *</i>

13:28.541 --> 13:30.304
Yeah!

13:30.409 --> 13:32.741
How about the time
we cheated on our S.A. Ts?

13:32.812 --> 13:37.374
- I didn't cheat on my S.A. Ts.
- Oh, rub that in my face again.

13:39.585 --> 13:41.678
I just think that
being honest with Brad

13:41.754 --> 13:44.245
is our best chance of getting him

13:44.323 --> 13:46.086
to stop doing drugs.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.183
We can't...

13:49.028 --> 13:52.657
I'm guessing you're not talking
about Metamucil.

13:55.434 --> 13:59.063
We... We caught Brad
with some marijuana.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.535
- Wow.
- "Wow."

14:01.640 --> 14:05.007
- You smoke this stuff too, don't you?
- No!

14:05.110 --> 14:08.079
Is that a real "no" or
I-don't-want-to-be-in-trouble "no"?

14:08.180 --> 14:09.613
It's a real "no".

14:11.584 --> 14:14.075
I think we can trust him.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.186
Yeah?

14:21.260 --> 14:23.751
- It's me.
- Come in.

14:25.364 --> 14:29.130
Oh, man, are you in deep!

14:30.836 --> 14:32.326
Did Mom and Dad tell you, too?

14:32.404 --> 14:35.931
Yeah. How could you
bring drugs into the house?

14:36.008 --> 14:38.977
I didn't bring them in.
I taped them to the swing outside.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.410
Oh, that's much better.

14:42.314 --> 14:44.179
I didn't even know you smoked.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.913
I've only done it a couple times. Come
on. You've been to a ton of parties.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.683
- Are you telling me you never smoked?
- No!

14:50.756 --> 14:54.123
I mean, the kids who are always smoking
seem so out of it.

14:54.193 --> 14:58.823
I never pictured myself sitting,
contemplating the meaning of string.

15:01.033 --> 15:04.491
- Yeah. Well, I don't do that.
- So what do you do?

15:04.570 --> 15:07.403
I don't know. We just sit around
and talk about stuff.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.533
- Like what?
- What do you care?

15:10.609 --> 15:13.271
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on with you.

15:13.345 --> 15:16.644
You know, what's going on with me
is that I'm grounded.

15:16.715 --> 15:19.479
- Where's Mom and Dad?
- They're in their room talking.

15:19.551 --> 15:21.815
- Good.
- Wait. Where are you going?

15:21.887 --> 15:23.912
I gotta make a phone call.

15:27.159 --> 15:30.026
What are you doing? Mom and Dad
told you to stay in your room.

15:30.095 --> 15:33.861
- Just shut up. I know what I'm doing.
- You've certainly proven that.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.999
Hey, Eric.
Yeah, it's Brad.

15:40.706 --> 15:43.937
No, no, no.
I can't take you to that party.

15:44.009 --> 15:46.341
Yeah, I kinda got busted by my parents.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.712
Yeah. I won't be smoking pot
for a while.

15:49.815 --> 15:52.579
- For a while?
- Hey, I gotta go.

15:55.821 --> 16:00.053
So, you're just gonna wait till we get
off your back and start smoking again?

16:00.125 --> 16:02.355
Brad, sit down, please.

16:02.428 --> 16:06.489
Guys, come on. I mean,
it's not like I'm doing hard drugs.

16:06.565 --> 16:09.728
You don't have to do hard drugs
to screw up your life.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.100
Yep. And we know that from experience.

16:12.171 --> 16:15.834
- So, you were potheads?
- No! I was a beerhead.

16:17.376 --> 16:18.536
But I was.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.807
You were friends with a girl
who smoked a lot of pot.

16:21.914 --> 16:24.815
And she got busted
and ended up going to jail.

16:24.883 --> 16:26.942
And her family wouldn't talk to her.

16:27.019 --> 16:30.352
So, as I recall,
her boyfriend had to bail her out.

16:30.422 --> 16:34.688
God knows what would've happened if
he werert around. The guy was a saint.

16:39.431 --> 16:41.524
- Was that a story about you?
- No!

16:41.600 --> 16:44.364
- Yes. Yes, it was.
- No!

16:44.436 --> 16:47.997
And it's not the whole story. I was...

16:48.974 --> 16:51.670
I got stoned at
a Led Zeppelin concert.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.212
I bought some dope
that was laced with something.

16:56.081 --> 16:59.175
- What was it laced with?
- I don't know.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.617
But I ended up in the emergency room,

17:01.720 --> 17:06.281
registered under the name
Charlene Fogelman.

17:08.394 --> 17:11.157
You used a phony name
so your parents wouldn't catch you?

17:11.230 --> 17:16.065
No. I thought I was Charlene Fogelman.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.136
Well, then how'd you end up in jail?

17:20.204 --> 17:22.969
Somebody turned me in.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.771
I was messed up
for a long time after that.

17:27.012 --> 17:31.312
<i>She still hyperventilates every time
she hears Stairway to Heaven.</i>

17:34.119 --> 17:36.087
But who doesn't?

17:36.922 --> 17:41.086
Look, Brad, I know what this is like,
you know?

17:41.160 --> 17:44.721
When you're young,
you want to have adventures.

17:44.797 --> 17:48.631
You think,
"Nothing bad can happen to me."

17:48.700 --> 17:50.565
It's just not true.

17:50.636 --> 17:55.403
Something bad can happen to you.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.270
Why would you want
to take that risk?

17:57.342 --> 18:00.402
Your life's,
you know, on track now.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.778
You don't want to get it off track.
You got so much going for you.

18:03.849 --> 18:07.216
You got so much to lose. I mean,
how about your soccer scholarship?

18:07.286 --> 18:10.255
And the trust of a family
who loves you.

18:12.558 --> 18:16.119
Yeah. I don't want to lose
my soccer scholarship...

18:19.832 --> 18:21.561
...or the other thing.

18:21.633 --> 18:24.534
"The other thing" is the most
important thing in your life.

18:24.603 --> 18:29.438
Nobody believes in
or cares for you as much as we do.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.408
I know that.

18:32.077 --> 18:34.341
So? What now?

18:34.413 --> 18:36.881
What are you gonna do
the next time you go to a party?

18:36.949 --> 18:40.612
Which, by the way,
will be a very long time from now.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.653
Someone wants you to smoke some pot,
what are you gonna do?

18:44.723 --> 18:46.418
I'll just say, "No, thanks."

18:46.492 --> 18:48.653
"Come on! Just a toke!
What's the matter?"

18:48.760 --> 18:50.284
Dad, I won't take it.

18:50.362 --> 18:53.661
What are you gonna tell them
when they ask why not?

18:53.732 --> 18:56.292
I don't know.
I'll just make up some kind of excuse.

18:56.401 --> 19:00.770
Here's what they tell us to use
at the counseling center.

19:00.873 --> 19:04.775
Tell them that you can't smoke
because if you get caught again,

19:04.843 --> 19:07.937
your parents are gonna
put you on drug testing.

19:08.013 --> 19:11.176
Well, do you think my friends
are really gonna buy that?

19:11.250 --> 19:14.185
Convince them.
Because it'll be true!

19:17.489 --> 19:20.822
- OK. I get the picture.
- Good.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.453
Now this sensitive,
emotional moment's over.

19:23.562 --> 19:26.929
You go back to your room and
I'll talk to you tomorrow after 10:00.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.126
- What then?
- Sentencing.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.903
- All right. I'm sorry.
- All right.

19:44.216 --> 19:47.549
- Do you think we got through to him?
- I don't know.

19:47.619 --> 19:49.450
I hope so.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.887
We can reason with him,
tell him horror stories.

19:51.957 --> 19:55.085
But when he goes out that door,
it's gonna be all up to him.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.856
- He's a good kid, though.
- Yeah. I think so.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.389
God!

20:01.466 --> 20:06.233
Do you remember when the worst problem
we had with Brad was toilet-training?

20:08.240 --> 20:10.174
Well, it makes sense.

20:10.242 --> 20:14.008
Couldrt get him on the pot,
now we're trying to get him off the pot.

20:20.285 --> 20:22.981
What a miserable day!

20:23.055 --> 20:24.579
You're telling me!

20:24.656 --> 20:27.716
First thing you know,
you're crashing through a gazebo.

20:27.793 --> 20:31.456
Next thing you know,
your oldest son is on drugs.

20:32.664 --> 20:35.360
Boy, I need a beer!

20:39.605 --> 20:42.369
Brad's not driving or going
to parties for two months.

20:42.441 --> 20:45.001
We went easy 'cause he was
the first one to get caught.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.739
However, the next one
gets the book thrown at him.

20:47.813 --> 20:51.374
- That's not fair.
- Well, no one said life was fair!

20:51.483 --> 20:54.509
You have the benefit of learning
from Brad's mistake.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.850
In some cultures
it's the kid who screwed up

20:56.922 --> 20:59.482
who's expected to learn
from his mistake.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.689
Well, this isn't
a fancy country like France.

21:04.396 --> 21:08.560
This is America, where one person
can screw it up for everybody.
