11:05.999 --> 11:09.836
I don't make up the rules.
I just wear the diapers.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.005
KJ Original Diapers.

11:12.671 --> 11:13.965
Indubitably.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.258
Oh!

11:15.342 --> 11:17.260
[clamoring]

11:18.136 --> 11:19.887
[Julien]
What did I say? What?

11:19.971 --> 11:24.351
You said lemurs with diapers are better
than lemurs without diapers.

11:24.434 --> 11:28.813
I run a transparent kingdom, Maurice.
My peoples deserve to hear the truth.

11:28.896 --> 11:32.442
-It was the platform I was elected on.
-You weren't elected.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.819
King Julien, I caught the diaper thief.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.488
-It was Mort!
-Mort?

11:36.571 --> 11:38.156
It wasn't me,
King Julien.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.867
I'm innocent. Innocent!

11:41.284 --> 11:42.536
Mort.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.912
Show his bottom to me!

11:46.623 --> 11:48.500
-That's not my logo.
-What?

11:48.583 --> 11:50.751
You're right. How could I miss this?

11:50.835 --> 11:53.547
Don't worry, King Julien.
I'll find the mugger.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.090
Wait a minute.
Who cares about the mugger?

11:56.174 --> 11:59.093
How can I be
the most fashionable king in history

11:59.177 --> 12:03.348
if someone is tarnishing my name
with KJ impostor diapers?

12:03.431 --> 12:04.265
Clover...

12:05.392 --> 12:08.186
-find out what he knows.
-[Mort whimpers]

12:09.604 --> 12:12.065
You gonna tell me
where you got the diaper?

12:12.148 --> 12:14.817
-What diaper?
-Don't play games with me, Mort.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.195
-[whimpering]
-I am good cop and bad cop

12:17.278 --> 12:22.116
all rolled into one terrifying
law enforcement burrito of pain!

12:24.077 --> 12:27.288
Here you go, little guy.
You must be so hungry.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.499
Go ahead.

12:29.790 --> 12:30.958
Eat up.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.091
There's more where that came from.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.594
I just need you to tell me
what you know.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.053
I don't know anything!

12:42.136 --> 12:43.012
[grunts]

12:43.096 --> 12:46.433
I'll ask you one more time!
Where did you get the diaper?

12:46.516 --> 12:47.475
Okay, I'll talk!

12:48.643 --> 12:52.230
I got it from a guy who works for a guy
who makes the diapers.

12:52.313 --> 12:55.900
-I need names, Mort!
-I don't know his name!

12:55.983 --> 12:57.985
But I know where to find him.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.738
Mm? Hm!

13:00.863 --> 13:02.031
[feedback]

13:02.781 --> 13:05.326
Remember, try to act normal.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.704
-Okay.
-Or as close to normal as you get.

13:07.786 --> 13:08.705
[giggles]

13:08.787 --> 13:13.084
The mic is in the front, so position
yourself to pick up what he's saying.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.670
And remember...
[yelling] I need names, Mort!

13:19.215 --> 13:23.470
Hi! I'm Mort. What's your name?

13:23.553 --> 13:25.054
Beat it, buddy.

13:27.056 --> 13:30.893
I don't suppose you know
where I can score a diaper?

13:30.977 --> 13:32.729
On the DL?

13:32.811 --> 13:33.980
Hm?

13:34.564 --> 13:37.525
-You a cop?
-Me, a cop?

13:37.609 --> 13:38.526
No way!

13:38.610 --> 13:39.818
[chuckles nervously]

13:39.902 --> 13:40.819
[sighs]

13:41.820 --> 13:45.283
Look, I'm all out.
You gotta talk to my suppliers.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.909
Uh, who's that?

13:48.035 --> 13:49.454
[whispers indistinctly]

13:51.372 --> 13:55.084
Can you say that again,
but louder, and into my diaper?

13:56.002 --> 13:57.462
[whispers indistinctly]

13:58.212 --> 13:59.130
Got ya!

14:02.133 --> 14:04.218
-Hi, Dorothy.
-[gasps, then chuckles]

14:04.302 --> 14:06.638
Clover. What a surprise!

14:06.721 --> 14:08.473
Come in, come in.

14:10.767 --> 14:11.726
Hm.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.270
[chuckling nervously]

14:14.354 --> 14:16.897
Perfect timing!
I just made quiche.

14:17.106 --> 14:21.068
Oh, you've got to try it.
It's out of this world!

14:22.403 --> 14:23.697
[chuckles]

14:28.326 --> 14:31.746
I'm sorry about the mess.
Can I get you a refreshment?

14:31.830 --> 14:34.040
No, thanks. I won't be staying long.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.376
Just wanted to ask you a few questions

14:36.459 --> 14:39.629
about the impostor diapers
that have been going around.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.881
Impostor diapers?

14:43.216 --> 14:46.927
[stuttering]
We don't know anything about that.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.222
That's what I thought.

14:49.347 --> 14:50.931
Well, sorry to bother you.

14:51.015 --> 14:54.728
Not at all. Sure you don't want
to stay for some quiche?

14:54.811 --> 14:57.938
No, thanks,
I don't eat quiche with criminals!

15:00.316 --> 15:01.275
Hm?

15:02.318 --> 15:03.986
[chuckles in embarrassment]

15:04.070 --> 15:06.113
Oh! So there's nothing there.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.866
Um-- [chuckles]

15:07.948 --> 15:11.786
Sorry, but that must mean
that there's something in here!

15:13.204 --> 15:14.121
Hm.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.500
Is everything okay, Clover?

15:17.584 --> 15:21.546
Uh-huh. Sure. Yeah. Totally fine.
I should go into--

15:30.471 --> 15:31.723
[panting]

15:32.557 --> 15:34.893
Why do all these rooms look the same?

15:36.644 --> 15:38.354
Sorry about the doors.

15:38.438 --> 15:42.525
Guess my intel was a bit, um... off.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.902
[laughs sheepishly]

15:48.030 --> 15:48.865
Huh?

15:55.204 --> 15:56.289
Ah-ha!

15:56.372 --> 15:58.999
It's the po-po, boys! Scatter!

15:59.125 --> 16:00.334
[all clamoring]

16:00.418 --> 16:01.836
[chuckling nervously]

16:03.212 --> 16:05.965
I am very disappointed in you two.

16:06.048 --> 16:09.594
We were only trying to make diapers
available to everyone.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.305
We saw a need
and tried to fill it.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.432
Well, you have to stop filling it!

16:14.515 --> 16:18.394
It's a trademark violation and,
more importantly, I don't like it.

16:18.478 --> 16:23.149
But, King Julien, imitation
is the highest form of flattery.

16:23.232 --> 16:27.445
Uh, no! Excessive flattery
is the highest form of flattery.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.363
Imitation is just lazy.

16:29.447 --> 16:32.283
No more impostor diapers!
You may go.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.621
Problem solved. Good work, Clover.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.414
Thank you, Your Majesty.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.917
[excited cheering]

16:42.126 --> 16:43.043
Who did that?

16:43.503 --> 16:47.632
-[lemur 1] Yeah!
-[lemur 1] Yeah! Whoo!

16:48.716 --> 16:49.592
[groaning]

16:50.092 --> 16:52.011
What is the meaning of this?

16:52.094 --> 16:54.639
I thought I said no more diapers!

16:54.722 --> 16:57.809
Actually, you said
we couldn't make impostor diapers,

16:57.892 --> 17:00.728
not anything about starting
a ready-to-wear line

17:00.812 --> 17:02.856
with a completely original design.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.817
Not that hoity-toity high fashion stuff
you make.

17:05.900 --> 17:09.487
No, but that--
Okay, you got me there, Ted.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.991
But there's only room for one fashion icon
in this jungle.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.075
This means war.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.161
Xixi here with some breaking news.

17:17.244 --> 17:21.833
I'm getting reports that an all-out
fashion war was declared earlier today

17:21.916 --> 17:24.919
between fashion-forward
KJ Original Diapers

17:25.003 --> 17:27.547
and recent rival, D+T Diapers.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.382
Let's go live to the scene.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.143
Tell us about your new design.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.021
It's called an animal print.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.940
[Julien]
Ha! That's no animal I've ever seen.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.567
Check this out!

17:48.275 --> 17:49.944
[all clamor]

17:50.737 --> 17:51.571
[all gasp]

17:52.572 --> 17:54.281
-Hmm?
-[all clamor]

17:55.616 --> 17:56.534
Wha--

18:01.497 --> 18:04.166
[camera clicking]

18:06.836 --> 18:10.548
Well, it's clear that the diapers are on
and the gloves are off,

18:10.631 --> 18:14.385
leaving the public to wonder
who will win this fashion showdown.

18:14.468 --> 18:18.056
I know one thing's for sure.
War has never looked so good.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.601
I think we may have let
this fashion thing go too far.

18:21.684 --> 18:25.646
-I disagree!
-But it's tearing the kingdom apart!

18:25.730 --> 18:29.108
Surely there's enough
pillowy soft absorbency for everyone

18:29.191 --> 18:31.903
to stay fashionably dry,
not just a select few.

18:31.986 --> 18:35.489
Quiet, Maurice. I'm trying to think
of a new diaper design--

18:35.615 --> 18:36.824
King Julien!

18:36.908 --> 18:38.701
It's Mort. He's hurt real bad.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.036
What happened to him?

18:40.119 --> 18:43.039
He was trampled
trying to get a KJ Original Diaper.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.040
[moaning]

18:44.123 --> 18:45.875
Speak to me.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.002
[weakly] King Julien, is that you?

18:48.168 --> 18:51.171
Yes, it's me. I'm here.

18:51.672 --> 18:56.010
I always hoped it would end
this way. Me in your arms!

18:57.095 --> 18:58.554
Oh!

18:59.263 --> 19:00.514
[groans]

19:00.598 --> 19:01.724
[gasps]

19:04.143 --> 19:05.394
[groaning]

19:07.521 --> 19:09.732
-He's so--
-[groaning]

19:13.820 --> 19:15.279
Mort--

19:15.362 --> 19:16.823
-I know our--
-[groaning]

19:17.531 --> 19:19.909
-If I could just--
-[groaning]

19:21.953 --> 19:23.788
No! Mort!

19:24.246 --> 19:27.416
Oh! He's so cold, Maurice.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.876
You're wrong, Maurice.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.379
There isn't enough pillowy soft
absorbency for everyone.

19:32.463 --> 19:33.756
We aren't all equal!

19:33.840 --> 19:36.383
Your Majesty,
you don't really believe that.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.551
Silence!

19:37.635 --> 19:39.637
I know how to end this war.

19:40.013 --> 19:43.850
Right now I need to say goodbye
to a patriot.

19:43.933 --> 19:47.937
Oh, Mort, I know our relationship
was complicated...

19:48.021 --> 19:52.692
by the fact that you were strange and
annoying and inferior to me in every way.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.778
But if I could just speak to you
one more time...

19:55.862 --> 19:58.156
I would tell you all the things

19:58.238 --> 20:02.743
I never had the courage to tell you
when you were alive.

20:02.827 --> 20:03.786
[gasps loudly]

20:03.911 --> 20:05.788
-What'd you tell me?
-It's alive!

20:05.872 --> 20:07.247
[Mort]
We'll talk later!

20:07.331 --> 20:08.166
[crash]

20:09.000 --> 20:09.959
[inhales]

20:10.043 --> 20:11.335
Oh!

20:11.418 --> 20:13.379
[lemur whispers]
Xixi, we're live.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.507
[gasps]
Xixi here with some breaking news.

20:16.590 --> 20:21.054
King Julien has just announced that
he will be putting on a new fashion show.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.389
King Julien, any deets to share?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.307
Nope. No deets, Xixi.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.309
It's going to be a surprise.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.979
That's it. You heard it here first, folks.

20:30.063 --> 20:33.232
Fasten your diapers,
it's going to be a dumpy night.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.902
[clamoring]

20:48.539 --> 20:51.125
[dance music playing]

20:57.423 --> 20:59.675
Feast your eyes on this!

20:59.800 --> 21:00.801
[all exclaim]

21:00.885 --> 21:02.095
[Julien] Oh, yeah.

21:02.178 --> 21:07.016
That's right! 100 percent,
Grade A, certified King Julien!

21:07.100 --> 21:08.684
He's not wearing any pants!

21:08.768 --> 21:10.061
My eyes!

21:10.144 --> 21:12.563
Ugh! That's not fashion, that's obscene!

21:12.646 --> 21:16.901
Let me tell you something about fashion,
Ted, and everybody!

21:16.984 --> 21:19.904
I said before
that you are who you wear

21:19.987 --> 21:23.741
and anybody who's somebody
is wearing a KJ Original Diaper.

21:23.824 --> 21:28.412
Well, let me tell you now,
fashion isn't about who you wear.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.249
Yeah! You-- Wait.
What? It's not?

21:31.331 --> 21:34.252
No! It's about who you are.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.003
Well said, Your Majesty!

21:36.087 --> 21:41.425
And while I'm a king who's fabulous
all the time, you are all just you.

21:41.508 --> 21:46.305
And you are fabulous none of the time!
No matter what you wear!

21:46.680 --> 21:48.141
[all] Huh?

21:48.224 --> 21:50.184
He just had to keep talking.

21:50.268 --> 21:51.518
But that's okay.

21:51.602 --> 21:55.815
Stop trying to be something you are not,
and just be you.

21:55.898 --> 22:00.236
Take off those diapers right now!
Go on! Rip those puppies off!

22:01.112 --> 22:03.156
I want to be me!

22:04.198 --> 22:05.908
[all exclaiming joyously]

22:06.408 --> 22:07.367
[squish]

22:07.451 --> 22:08.286
Yuck!

22:09.787 --> 22:11.622
Yeah! Yeah! That's right!

22:11.705 --> 22:15.293
Be boring and the same!
Be free!

22:17.461 --> 22:18.504
Uh-oh.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.214
That's a lot of--

22:21.090 --> 22:22.382
Incoming!

22:22.967 --> 22:24.844
[screaming]

22:27.513 --> 22:29.640
[moans in pleasure]

22:29.723 --> 22:32.310
I'm glad to be rid of that diaper.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.812
It was giving me a terrible rash.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.230
I got one!

22:36.314 --> 22:39.566
Oh, Mort, that was so five minutes ago.

22:39.650 --> 22:40.484
[groans]

22:41.359 --> 22:43.445
[pop song playing]
