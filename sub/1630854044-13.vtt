to hear it from me.

-Don't you do that.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.995
I said, "All I have to do
is think about your life

37:29.706 --> 37:31.414
whenever I thought
my life was bad."

37:32.960 --> 37:34.793

But you know

-Yeah.

39:11.132 --> 39:12.182
-We're both doing
all right.
-We are.

39:12.184 --> 39:13.808
[both chuckle]

39:13.810 --> 39:17.562
[sighs] It's wild seeing you
after all this time.

39:17.564 --> 39:19.189
You're the same,
but different.

39:19.775 --> 39:20.881
Grown.

39:20.883 --> 39:23.109
-Why, thank you.
-[both chuckle]

39:24.988 --> 39:27.697
No, you know,
I feel grown...

39:28.492 --> 39:30.784
'cause I feel settled,
finally.

39:30.860 --> 39:32.427
You know what I mean?

39:32.429 --> 39:37.248
We all have to find
what settled means to us
and...

39:37.250 --> 39:39.292
you know, I guess I found it.

39:41.296 --> 39:42.504
Have you?

39:45.675 --> 39:48.468
Wow. That's a good question.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.514
I guess,
if I had to think about it...

39:53.683 --> 39:57.894
I'm not,
but I'm closer than I was.

39:57.971 --> 39:59.211
-Okay.
-[Hollywood shouting] Remy!

39:59.289 --> 40:01.189
-Yo?
-[Hollywood] Bust a move,
brother!

40:01.191 --> 40:04.359
-Yup, yup!
I'll see you there?
-[Nova] Definitely.

40:05.862 --> 40:08.571
And thank you.

40:08.573 --> 40:11.741
This plan, if it works,
we'll get our land back.

40:11.818 --> 40:15.328
It's huge. It's everything
we want and need.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.732
It's gonna work.

40:30.387 --> 40:32.220
I'm gonna get
another cup of coffee
before we leave.

40:32.264 --> 40:33.721
-All right.
-[Billie chuckles]

40:36.351 --> 40:39.060
[sighs] It's good
to see Remy, wasn't it?

40:39.062 --> 40:42.730
It is. It's strange, though.

40:42.765 --> 40:45.942
So many people from my past
have come back into
my life recently.

40:46.019 --> 40:48.002
I kind of don't know
what to make of it.

40:48.004 --> 40:51.281
I feel like it's all
trying to tell me something,
but I don't know what.

40:51.283 --> 40:52.282
[hesitates] I...

40:53.368 --> 40:55.410
I'm babbling. [laughs]

40:55.454 --> 40:57.787
-I'm sorry.
-[Billie] Oh, girl.
No, don't worry about that.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.664
You sorting through
your past like that?

41:00.792 --> 41:04.878
I mean,
it changed my life,
changed everything.

41:04.880 --> 41:07.422
Seeing you girls right now
reminds me of the time

41:07.424 --> 41:09.215
Ernest and I were
talking about you.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.219
Yeah, it was...

41:15.390 --> 41:16.764
It was a hard day.

41:18.143 --> 41:21.728
<i> Billie, it was</i>
<i> your mama's funeral.</i>

41:25.859 --> 41:27.609
[sighs]

41:32.741 --> 41:34.908
-[Ernest] You all right?
-Yeah, I'm good.

41:34.910 --> 41:36.117
Thank you for coming.

41:40.790 --> 41:42.390
[sighs] Mmm.

41:43.460 --> 41:47.670
-You didn't have
to make that drive.
-You kidding?

41:47.672 --> 41:50.548
I wouldn't have missed it.
How you holding up?

41:50.550 --> 41:52.675
Oh, you know,
best I can.

41:53.512 --> 41:55.220
Trying to deal
with Billie.

41:56.139 --> 41:57.722
She wasn't going to come...

41:57.724 --> 42:00.058
to her mother's funeral
if it was in Louisiana.

42:00.060 --> 42:02.101
Swore she was never
coming back to St Jo.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.896
[scoffs]

42:04.898 --> 42:07.649
-That girl's a handful,
ain't it?
-[chuckles]

42:07.651 --> 42:10.693
You got that right.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

42:11.238 --> 42:12.946
[chuckling] Sit down.

42:18.578 --> 42:21.704
Prosper,
count it as a blessing.

42:21.706 --> 42:25.959
Claire was in Billie's life
as an adult.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.797
I think that's one
of the things with Nova.

42:31.675 --> 42:34.175
Trudy wasn't there
to help guide her...

42:34.844 --> 42:36.219
tell her things...

42:37.931 --> 42:39.931
that I can't tell her
or couldn't tell her.

42:39.933 --> 42:41.307
I didn't know how.

42:45.772 --> 42:46.896
When...

42:47.732 --> 42:48.982
me and Trudy...

42:49.818 --> 42:52.652
finally broke up,
that last time,

42:52.654 --> 42:54.404
she said to me,
she said...

42:58.660 --> 42:59.993
She said, "Ernest...

43:01.371 --> 43:04.163
love goes its own way,
just like the river.

43:04.165 --> 43:07.375
You can't force it
or make it go your way.

43:09.212 --> 43:10.420
If you smart...

43:11.631 --> 43:13.381
you'll just...

43:14.301 --> 43:15.300
flow with it."

43:18.138 --> 43:20.054
Wise woman. Wise woman.

43:22.684 --> 43:23.975
Our daughters...

43:25.020 --> 43:27.395
will be wise one day too...

43:28.732 --> 43:30.732
when they come
to understand that...

43:32.193 --> 43:34.110
it doesn't matter
how love comes...

43:35.697 --> 43:39.032
rich, poor, man, woman...

43:40.952 --> 43:43.328
black, white...

43:46.082 --> 43:49.626
here or hereafter...

43:51.963 --> 43:54.964
it flows its own way...

43:56.468 --> 44:00.011
and you gotta flow with it.

44:15.320 --> 44:18.696
Co-op funds, Charley's meal
collateral, and Hollywood
and Vi's contribution

44:18.698 --> 44:20.180
we had 250 K.

44:20.182 --> 44:23.117
And then that big,
anonymous donation
out of D.C.

44:23.119 --> 44:24.994
brought us to 450,000.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.830
And Betty's farm
as collateral gave...
another...

44:27.832 --> 44:28.956
75 k.

44:28.958 --> 44:30.708
So then we put in
the movie money

44:30.743 --> 44:32.627
we've got 750 K to bid with.

44:34.422 --> 44:36.047
So if none of the farmer's
bid against us,

44:36.049 --> 44:37.674
we might actually have a shot.
