AL:

01:24.920 --> 01:27.500
We're a three-piece band,
Al, playing six instruments.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.510
All right now,
listen to this.

01:29.510 --> 01:32.260
Before you make an offer, I just
want you to picture something.

01:32.260 --> 01:35.350
It's 6:00, Saturday night.

01:35.350 --> 01:37.260
Milwaukee is
especially boring,

01:37.260 --> 01:39.350
but the word is out.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.550
There's a marathon
dance at Arnold's.

01:41.550 --> 01:44.140
Not just measly records
on the jukebox,

01:44.140 --> 01:46.140
no, we've got a live
band here, Al,

01:46.140 --> 01:48.140
and the place is packed.

01:48.140 --> 01:50.140
The kids... the kids
are very hungry

01:50.140 --> 01:51.640
because the music is so good,

01:51.640 --> 01:53.110
and they want cheeseburgers
at this table.

01:53.110 --> 01:55.150
Over here, they want
to have pizza.

01:55.150 --> 01:56.870
At this table, they
want fish sandwiches.

01:56.870 --> 01:58.950
Oh...

01:58.950 --> 01:59.950
the fish is selling?

01:59.950 --> 02:02.570
Of course it's selling.

02:02.570 --> 02:05.660
Look at this, Al, you have
no room on your grill.

02:05.660 --> 02:07.410
Your freezers are empty.

02:07.410 --> 02:09.130
They're buying the fish?

02:09.130 --> 02:11.210
They're buying
everything, Al.

02:11.710 --> 02:13.720
And by the end of
the marathon dance,

02:13.720 --> 02:15.300
you are completely sold out.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.750
The biggest day in
Arnold's history!

02:17.750 --> 02:20.340
I love it! I love it!

02:20.340 --> 02:22.730
Okay, I'll pay the band $25.

02:22.730 --> 02:25.010
$25?

02:25.010 --> 02:26.100
Oh, forget it,
forget it.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.680
$35 plus a meal.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.270
Will you eat the fish?

02:29.270 --> 02:30.770
No.
You got a deal, Al.

02:30.770 --> 02:32.770
Good bargaining, Ralph,
good bargaining!

02:32.770 --> 02:35.270
Okay, I've got to order
some fish; I'll rent a freezer!

02:35.270 --> 02:38.270
Hey, Chang, they're
buying the fish!

02:38.270 --> 02:40.780
Well, do I drive
a hard bargain

02:40.780 --> 02:42.780
or do I drive
a hard bargain?

02:45.280 --> 02:47.780
He used to be
such a nice guy.

02:47.780 --> 02:48.790
What's wrong?

02:48.790 --> 02:51.040
You're upset because
I closed the deal?

02:51.040 --> 02:53.590
I was trying for $200.

02:56.540 --> 02:58.040
$200?

02:58.550 --> 02:59.550
I heard, I heard.

02:59.550 --> 03:00.550
What do you mean?

03:01.050 --> 03:02.630
How could he ask for $200?

03:02.630 --> 03:05.220
You just signed us up
for a marathon dance, Ralph.

03:05.220 --> 03:07.220
We could be working
for 15 hours.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.810
15 hours?

03:10.270 --> 03:12.230
RALPH:
That's terrible!

03:12.230 --> 03:15.810
That's 15 times
three, into 35...

03:15.810 --> 03:17.730
78 cents an hour.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.320
Look, you can't blame me.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.820
I got us good money,
it's the hours that are bad.

03:21.820 --> 03:23.320
Let's get something
to drink, Pots.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.820
You got money?

03:24.820 --> 03:26.240
No, we'll sip
other people's.
Oh.

03:28.580 --> 03:30.660
(excited chatter)

03:33.160 --> 03:35.160
I'll buy you a malt, Joanie,
you'll forget about them.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.580
Forget?

03:36.580 --> 03:39.800
Forget being cut
from the pom-pom girls?

03:39.800 --> 03:40.890
Oh, you didn't make it, huh?

03:40.890 --> 03:43.920
Do you see pom-poms in my hand?
Well, relax.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.010
Look, it's the first
time you tried out.

03:46.010 --> 03:48.010
Maybe you just
weren't good enough.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.510
Not good enough?
Show him your cheer.

03:49.510 --> 03:51.100
Yeah, watch this.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.180
Hit them high, hit them low,

03:53.180 --> 03:56.100
come on, Jefferson, go, go, go!

03:58.490 --> 03:59.860
Pretty good, huh?

04:02.190 --> 04:04.360
Not bad.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.950
Jill Higgins is the captain.

04:05.950 --> 04:08.080
She's the one who cut me.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.670
Aw, don't you think you're
taking it too seriously?

04:10.670 --> 04:13.670
Big deal. So you didn't make
the pom-poms.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.670
Yeah, Joanie,
it's no big deal.

04:15.670 --> 04:17.170
Well, it is to me.

04:17.170 --> 04:19.130
She's always flaunting
her pom-poms.

04:21.589 --> 04:23.850
Excuse me, Cunningham.

04:23.850 --> 04:26.380
Sure, Higgins.

04:26.380 --> 04:28.690
Jimmy, could I talk to you?

04:28.690 --> 04:30.770
Sure.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.140
Come on,
we'll have a malt.

04:32.140 --> 04:35.280
Jimmy, where are you going?

04:35.280 --> 04:37.360
With Jill.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.230
She's a pom-pom.

04:43.530 --> 04:45.620
I can't take it anymore,
I can't take it.

04:45.620 --> 04:47.120
She beats me at everything.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.120
When we did our science project,

04:49.120 --> 04:50.990
her snake swallowed
my white mouse.

04:55.750 --> 04:59.330
I always wondered
whatever happened to Herbert.

04:59.330 --> 05:01.830
♪ La, la, la, la,
la, la, la ♪

05:01.830 --> 05:03.420
♪ La, la, la. ♪

05:03.420 --> 05:07.010
Joanie, I know you can beat that
pom-pom at the marathon dance.

05:07.510 --> 05:10.010
Well, not only am I not
entering the dance marathon,

05:10.010 --> 05:11.510
I'm not even going.

05:11.510 --> 05:12.480
What do you mean,
you're not going?

05:12.480 --> 05:13.980
We're all going.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.010
I'm going to be a judge,

05:15.520 --> 05:17.020
Mother's going to be
the first aid lady,

05:17.020 --> 05:18.020
and Richie's playing
in the band.

05:18.020 --> 05:19.990
It's almost a
family outing.

05:19.990 --> 05:23.070
I wouldn't have a chance against
her in the dance marathon.

05:23.070 --> 05:25.270
Her partner is
her brother, Bubba.

05:25.270 --> 05:30.110
Well, a Bubba doesn't
sound so hard to beat.

05:30.110 --> 05:35.200
This Bubba lifts
weights, cars, trains...

05:41.790 --> 05:43.380
I gotta tell you,
I gotta tell you,

05:43.380 --> 05:45.380
I'm very sorry that I'm late.

05:45.380 --> 05:47.510
Hey, look at this, huh?

05:47.510 --> 05:50.380
Asparagus... all right.

05:50.380 --> 05:52.640
Corn, huh?

05:52.640 --> 05:55.610
I'll tell you something,
I love being well-balanced.

05:55.610 --> 05:56.690
Heyyy...

06:00.190 --> 06:01.690
Why is everybody staring?

06:01.690 --> 06:03.780
Did I do something wrong?

06:03.780 --> 06:05.110
Is there a hair out of place?

06:07.400 --> 06:08.900
Arthur?
Yeah.

06:08.900 --> 06:12.160
How would you like to enter
a dance marathon?

06:12.160 --> 06:13.740
Well, I'll tell you
something, Mrs. C.,

06:13.740 --> 06:15.240
there's a marathon
I want to enter,

06:15.240 --> 06:17.460
but it's got nothing
to do with dancing.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.160
(laughing)

06:19.160 --> 06:20.250
(laughter continues)

06:23.720 --> 06:28.550
I was talking about
being Joanie's partner.

06:28.550 --> 06:31.140
Oh, hey, no offense, no offense,
but I can't.

06:31.140 --> 06:32.640
See, I promised Eddie Milkis

06:32.640 --> 06:35.180
I'd be his mechanic in a
stock car race in Chicago.

06:35.180 --> 06:36.260
But that's on Friday night.

06:36.260 --> 06:38.820
And you could make it
back in plenty of time.

06:38.820 --> 06:39.900
Oh, listen, Fonzie

06:39.900 --> 06:40.900
doesn't have to help us.

06:40.900 --> 06:41.900
I mean, it's not as if

06:41.900 --> 06:42.900
he's one of the family.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.410
Hey.

06:52.860 --> 06:54.910
Why are you putting
your food back?

06:54.910 --> 06:58.000
Because the Fonz does
nothing out of guilt.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I happen to be a free spirit,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.120
happily motoring
down the road of life.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.170
I want to beat
Jill Higgins.

07:05.170 --> 07:09.260
Jill Higgins, you mean that
little pom pop turnip?

07:09.260 --> 07:10.760
Is she still bugging you?

07:10.760 --> 07:12.220
Yeah, more than ever.

07:12.220 --> 07:14.800
Yeah, and you're Joanie's
only chance of beating her.

07:14.800 --> 07:19.060
I'll tell you, the Fonz's
work is never done.

07:19.060 --> 07:22.360
So, Fonz, are you going
to enter the dance marathon?

07:22.360 --> 07:25.230
Only if this chick
shows me her dimples.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.730
All right.

07:28.730 --> 07:30.320
Okay, let's eat.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.320
Yeah, now I can get
back my veggies.

07:37.870 --> 07:41.380
You are going to be the
handsomest judge at the dance.

07:41.380 --> 07:43.880
And you are going to be
the prettiest first aid lady.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.410
Thank you, dear.

07:45.410 --> 07:47.500
You know,
I haven't dressed like this

07:47.500 --> 07:48.720
since World War II.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.300
Yeah, I know.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.970
I remember when I came home
on furlough, you were so cute.

07:52.970 --> 07:55.560
That's when
we had Joanie.
Yeah.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.430
Oh, boy,

07:58.430 --> 08:01.400
every Saturday
it's the same thing.

08:02.770 --> 08:05.320
When is that kid
going to college?

08:05.320 --> 08:07.400
Joanie will be
down in a minute.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.910
Have you heard
anything from Fonzie?

08:08.910 --> 08:10.910
No, not a word.

08:10.910 --> 08:12.830
Yeah, but you know,
he's always late;

08:12.830 --> 08:14.410
likes to make
the grand entrance

08:14.410 --> 08:15.860
just in the nick of time.

08:15.860 --> 08:17.950
Well, I gotta get going.

08:17.950 --> 08:20.450
Al wants us to get there
a half hour early

08:20.450 --> 08:21.870
to help defrost the fish.

08:23.620 --> 08:25.170
He's so excited.

08:25.170 --> 08:26.710
I'm not very excited.

08:26.710 --> 08:31.210
39 cents an hour and I have to
split it with a girl drummer.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.299
(doorbell chiming)

08:32.299 --> 08:33.299
There's Arthur.

08:33.299 --> 08:34.799
Yeah, what did
I tell you?

08:34.799 --> 08:36.299
Ready for the
grand entrance,

08:36.299 --> 08:38.299
all spruced up and
ready to go, huh?

08:40.470 --> 08:44.520
Uh, like they say,
better late than never.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.074

08:58.450 --> 09:01.460
So I'm coming back
from Chicago,

09:01.460 --> 09:03.460
and all of a sudden
I'm making this turn...

09:03.460 --> 09:07.160
and my handlebars fell
right off the bike.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.170
MARION:
Oh, my goodness!

09:09.170 --> 09:12.750
Yeah, it makes it a little
rough on the curves.

09:12.750 --> 09:15.250
Well, how did you get here?

09:15.250 --> 09:19.260
Well, I pushed
my bike 12 miles.

09:19.260 --> 09:22.260
The last three
on my knees.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.400
I can't walk
one more step.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.980
No. Well, it's all right.
Joanie will understand.

09:27.980 --> 09:29.490
Yeah, sure.

09:29.490 --> 09:30.490
There'll be
other marathons.

09:30.490 --> 09:31.990
She can enter next year.

09:31.990 --> 09:34.990
Oh, Fonzie, I'm
so glad you...

09:34.990 --> 09:35.990
Well, what happened?

09:36.490 --> 09:37.490
You're not even ready.

09:37.490 --> 09:38.950
Yeah, look,
Shortcake,

09:38.950 --> 09:40.530
I was coming
around this turn...

09:40.530 --> 09:42.250
You're not going
to the dance?

09:42.250 --> 09:44.330
HOWARD:
Well, sweetheart,
he tried to...

09:44.330 --> 09:47.340
No, no, no, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

09:47.340 --> 09:49.340
whoa...

09:49.340 --> 09:52.340
Would I give up
a date with a chick

09:52.340 --> 09:54.130
that is cuter than
a button, huh?

09:54.130 --> 09:56.210
No.

09:56.710 --> 09:58.210
I'll take a freshen-up shower,

09:58.210 --> 10:01.720
put on my dancing moccasins,
and I'll be fit as a fiddle.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.860

RICHIE:
Seven full...
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

11:22.630 --> 11:25.100
There's another couple
out of the marathon.

11:25.100 --> 11:29.190
Our judges Howard and Marion
Cunningham will assist them off.

11:29.190 --> 11:31.690
Who knows?

11:31.690 --> 11:35.030
Who will be the last couple
still dancing?

11:35.030 --> 11:36.650
Who can answer this question?

11:36.650 --> 11:39.230
Folks, we have more fish.

11:39.230 --> 11:40.730
Plenty of fish.

11:40.730 --> 11:42.400
Right, Al.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.240
RICHIE:
Who will be able to stand
the grueling, painful hours,

11:46.240 --> 11:50.330
and win for themselves
this wonderful trophy

11:50.330 --> 11:54.880
donated by Crepnicks
Foot Pad Company?

11:54.880 --> 11:57.720
Hey, Red, I'm growing tired
from listening to your voice.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.250
Uh, right, Bubba.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.340
Getting ready to
give up, Joanie?

12:02.340 --> 12:05.890
Let me tell you
something, little girl.

12:05.890 --> 12:08.480
This lady just asked me
to take her roller-skating

12:08.480 --> 12:11.400
when we win this
marathon, and we will.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.980
So I see we got a little
competition this year, huh?

12:14.980 --> 12:15.900
Very little.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.320
Do you know what
I think is terrific?

12:19.320 --> 12:21.110
That an elephant
learned how to talk.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.170
Well, then maybe you'd like
to make a little wager, huh?

12:31.170 --> 12:33.620
Say five bucks,
ducktail?

12:33.620 --> 12:37.670
Oh, no, come on, let's make it
ten, you creep.

12:37.670 --> 12:39.840
And, oh, oh, oh,

12:39.840 --> 12:41.930
just so that you
don't get confused,

12:41.930 --> 12:45.430

12:50.050 --> 12:52.640
Yowza, yowza, yowza.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.640
We got the first challenge dance
of the evening.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.640
Jill picks the dance and
challenges the other contestants

12:57.640 --> 13:00.150
to keep up or get disqualified.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.950
Name your dance, Jill.

13:01.950 --> 13:03.980

13:03.980 --> 13:07.070
RICHIE:
Oh, a killer,
a real killer dance.

13:07.070 --> 13:08.570
I'm glad
we only have to play.

13:59.620 --> 14:01.540
That a way, bird. Yeah.

14:01.540 --> 14:02.630
(song ends)

14:08.960 --> 14:10.720
(bell clangs)

14:10.720 --> 14:12.800
Yowza, yowza, yowza,

14:13.300 --> 14:16.310
and Jill's challenge jitterbug
really took its toll.

14:16.310 --> 14:18.940
Four more couples
have dropped out.

14:18.940 --> 14:21.640
Well, we're gonna take
a two-minute break right now.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.230
Now everybody remember,

14:23.230 --> 14:25.230
they got to be back
on the dance floor

14:25.230 --> 14:28.230
when we start the next number.

14:33.070 --> 14:35.660
I feel great,
don't you, Fonz?

14:35.660 --> 14:37.160
Superb.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.660
Well, I'm gonna
go get a drink.

14:39.660 --> 14:41.580
Just rest a minute, okay?

14:43.500 --> 14:45.670
Hey, Fonz, you're
doing great. Fonz?

14:45.670 --> 14:47.250
Fonz!
Yeah?

14:47.250 --> 14:49.310
Oh, good.
There's only
six couples left.

14:49.310 --> 14:51.390
(wearily):
Oh, that's terrific.
Cunningham?

14:51.390 --> 14:52.390
Hmm?

14:52.390 --> 14:55.480
What are those two words
you start every sentence with?

14:55.480 --> 14:57.850
Yowza, yow...

14:57.850 --> 15:02.150
You're giving me a headache!

15:02.150 --> 15:04.240
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.240
That's all right.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.740
Listen, why don't
you just tell Joanie

15:07.740 --> 15:09.530
about having to push
your bike all the way?

15:09.530 --> 15:11.110
She'll understand that.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.110
Hey, are you kidding me?

15:12.110 --> 15:15.110
This marathon means
so much to her, huh?

15:15.110 --> 15:17.120
I can make it.
I'm making it.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.870
(bell clangs twice)

15:18.870 --> 15:20.450
All right, Fonz,
good luck.

15:20.950 --> 15:22.840
And you're
looking terrific.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.180
RALPH:
Hey, Rich,
I can't sing anymore.

15:27.180 --> 15:29.210
I've sung the whole Top 40
and three hymns.

15:29.210 --> 15:31.260
Oh. Okay, you'd better
sing one, Ralph.

15:31.260 --> 15:32.260
I'll play the piano.

15:32.260 --> 15:33.770
Okay.

15:33.770 --> 15:37.300
Yowza, yowza.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.390

15:39.390 --> 15:41.860

It's time to end
the two-minute break.

on the floor.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.610
We know how much
you love to do the twist.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.200
So, for our next number,
we're gonna...

15:48.200 --> 15:49.200
Cunningham?

15:49.700 --> 15:52.200
I think it's about time
that we do a waltz.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.650
A waltz?

15:53.650 --> 15:55.740
Oh, come on, Rich,
I don't want to do...

15:55.740 --> 16:04.080

17:21.910 --> 17:23.490
JILL:
You can stop.

17:23.490 --> 17:24.990
Let me tell
you something.

17:24.990 --> 17:27.000
Even if I wanted
to stop, I can't.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.500
This body don't quit.
Huh.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.000
Well, then, maybe you'd like
to up our little bet.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.500
Up it where?

17:39.430 --> 17:40.510
Forget money.

17:40.510 --> 17:43.310
If we win, you get a crewcut.

17:43.310 --> 17:44.900
(Bubba cackling)

17:44.900 --> 17:46.230
Crewcut?
Let me tell you...

17:46.230 --> 17:47.320
(clucking)

17:47.320 --> 17:48.320
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, whoa!

17:48.320 --> 17:49.320
Keep dancing.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.820
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.910
All right, all right,
I'm dancing, I'm dancing.

17:52.910 --> 17:55.990
Listen, if we lose, I'll get
a crewcut, but we won't, see?

17:55.990 --> 17:58.990
And when we win, then Miss
Cunningham here becomes

17:58.990 --> 18:01.500
a cheerleader like she should
have been in the first place.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.410
It's a bet.

18:02.410 --> 18:04.000
(falsetto):
It's a bet.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.510
Thanks, Fonz.
You're the greatest.

18:10.510 --> 18:12.510
Heyyy...

18:12.510 --> 18:15.010
Hold me up, will you?
Hold me up.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.510
Okay. Listen, listen.
if you have to get a crewcut,

18:17.510 --> 18:19.520
I'll knit you a cap.

18:19.520 --> 18:22.020
You'll knit me
a Spanish accent

18:22.020 --> 18:24.020
'cause I'm going
to Peru!

18:27.110 --> 18:28.640
(upbeat music playing)

18:36.060 --> 18:36.820
Fish...

18:40.820 --> 18:42.200
Yowza, yowza...

18:47.490 --> 18:48.790
(bell clangs)

18:50.300 --> 18:53.080
(wearily):
Yowza, yowza, yowza.

18:53.080 --> 18:56.670
RICHIE:
Here we are
in the 14th hour.

18:56.670 --> 18:59.170
There are still
three couples dancing.

19:01.670 --> 19:04.180
There are still
two couples dancing.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.900
We're dedicating this next
cha-cha challenge

19:15.900 --> 19:22.610
to those stubborn,
wonderful, rotten,
dancing fools.

19:23.110 --> 19:25.610
I can't sing
anymore, Rich.

19:25.610 --> 19:26.620
Me, neither.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.200
(drum solo)

19:31.670 --> 19:33.260
Show-off.

19:33.260 --> 19:35.260
Where do girls get
all that energy?

19:35.260 --> 19:36.260
I don't know.

19:36.260 --> 19:39.760
I hear girls have
extra-large adrenaline glands.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.760
You have to hear that?

19:40.760 --> 19:43.930
You couldn't see
for yourself?

19:43.930 --> 19:45.020
RICHIE:
We're gonna take
a two-minute break now.

19:45.020 --> 19:46.390
Let's take a break.

19:46.390 --> 19:46.970
(bell clangs)

19:49.470 --> 19:53.360
Oh, Fonz, no, don't lie down;
it'll be harder to get up.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.890
Don't you ever
get tired?

19:55.890 --> 19:58.480
JOANIE: No, it's
not a school night.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.450
MARION:
Arthur,

19:59.450 --> 20:00.530
are you all right, dear?

20:00.530 --> 20:06.070
Hey, it's like taking candy
from a baby, Mrs. Whoever.

20:06.070 --> 20:07.660
Howard...

20:07.660 --> 20:08.660
Huh?

20:08.660 --> 20:10.160
Arthur, he's had
too much.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.660
You've got
to disqualify him.

20:11.660 --> 20:13.660
No, I, I'm not going
to do that, Marion,

20:13.660 --> 20:15.160
but I'll talk to Joanie.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.670
It's better for her
if she makes the decision.

20:17.670 --> 20:18.670
Now, don't worry
about it.

20:18.670 --> 20:21.670
She's a sweet and
sympathetic girl.

20:21.670 --> 20:24.140
What do you mean,
you want to quit?!

20:24.140 --> 20:25.220
You can't quit!

20:25.220 --> 20:27.140
You're all talk,
no action!

20:34.820 --> 20:35.820
It worked!

20:35.820 --> 20:37.820
You're standing up, Fonz.
I knew you could do it.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.820
Hey, that was a trick?

20:41.820 --> 20:46.110
That was a good one,
Shortcake.

20:46.110 --> 20:48.200
Joanie, come here.
I gotta talk to you.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.700
Oh, I got Fonzie
going again.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.200
Boy, he tires easy.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.700
Yeah, but there's
a reason for it.

20:52.700 --> 20:54.200
Now, enough is enough.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.620
Oh, but I feel great!

20:55.620 --> 21:00.180
Joanie, it is not you!
Would you look at Fonzie?

21:01.680 --> 21:03.850
He's fine.
I keep tricking him.

21:03.850 --> 21:05.510
(bell clangs)

21:05.510 --> 21:06.600
Oh, gotta go, Dad.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.600
Wait a minute.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.350
Now, Fonzie didn't want you
to know this,

21:10.350 --> 21:13.940
but he pushed
his motorcycle 12 miles

21:13.940 --> 21:16.020
just to get
to this dance on time,

21:16.020 --> 21:17.610
for you.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.060
Now, do you still want
to go on tricking him?

21:26.540 --> 21:28.490
(bell clangs twice)

21:31.370 --> 21:33.960
I'm up, right?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.080
I'm up. My feet
are moving like a bandit.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.250
You're in la-la land, Fonz.

21:38.250 --> 21:39.830
Oh, yeah?

21:39.830 --> 21:43.590
Let me tell you something, it's
a lot of fun in la-la land.

21:43.590 --> 21:45.170
It might not look it,

21:45.170 --> 21:49.170
but inside,
I'm doing the mambo.

21:49.170 --> 21:51.180
Oh, Fonz,
the dance is over.

21:51.180 --> 21:52.680
Did we win, huh?
We won, huh?

21:52.680 --> 21:54.230
Hey, we won.

21:54.230 --> 21:56.820
Whoa, I knew we could make it.

21:56.820 --> 21:57.980
That's it.

21:57.980 --> 21:59.570
He really wanted
to go on.

21:59.570 --> 22:01.070
It's me, I quit.

22:01.070 --> 22:04.570
That's it! Fonzie's
finished. We win!

22:04.570 --> 22:07.330
Hey, Fonz, I know a barber
who gives great crewcuts!

22:07.330 --> 22:08.780
Crewcut!

22:12.330 --> 22:14.330
Crewcut?

22:14.330 --> 22:17.920
Hey, you're talking
about my hair here.

22:17.920 --> 22:18.920
Let me tell you something.

22:19.420 --> 22:21.260
I have a challenge dance
request.

22:21.260 --> 22:22.340
No.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.840
RICHIE:
Yowza, yowza...

22:24.840 --> 22:26.930
No yowza, just a challenge.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.010
This challenge dance
is called...

22:29.510 --> 22:30.850
(falsetto):
the kazatski!

22:33.220 --> 22:34.300
RICHIE:
We'll fake it.

22:34.300 --> 22:38.520
Yeah, one, two,
one, two, three!

22:38.520 --> 22:40.610
("Hava Nagila" playing)

22:49.200 --> 22:51.200
(rhythmic handclaps)

23:14.680 --> 23:15.680
Wow!

23:15.680 --> 23:17.180
(applause)

23:17.180 --> 23:19.180
(song ends, cheering)

23:20.650 --> 23:26.070
The winners are
Cunningham and Fonzarelli!

23:35.500 --> 23:39.030
I would just like to
thank someone, uh, here tonight

23:39.030 --> 23:42.450
without whom this whole thing
would not have been possible.

23:42.450 --> 23:45.540
Of course, I am
talking about myself.

23:46.790 --> 23:48.290
(applause)

23:48.290 --> 23:52.380
Also, uh, thanks very
much for my foot. Hmm.

23:52.380 --> 23:55.380
I would also like to say
that Joanie Cunningham,

23:55.380 --> 23:57.890
our newest pom-pom girl
at Jefferson High School

23:57.890 --> 23:58.890
is not bad, either.

23:59.390 --> 24:00.390
Thanks, Fonz.

24:00.390 --> 24:02.140
(applause)

24:02.140 --> 24:04.230
Don't tell Mom we lost.

24:04.230 --> 24:05.560
Oh, Bubba.

24:06.900 --> 24:08.360
FONZIE:
Girls?

24:11.900 --> 24:14.570
Home, James. Heyyy...

24:25.750 --> 24:27.330
You know something, Joanie?

24:27.330 --> 24:29.500
You were fantastic.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.090
(gasps)

24:31.090 --> 24:32.590
You kissed me!

24:32.590 --> 24:35.010
Oh, well, it-it's late.
I lost my head.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.730
Did you see that?

24:45.730 --> 24:48.240
She kissed her brother.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.240
It's been a day
of miracles.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.440
Yeah.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.520
Can I walk you home?

24:52.520 --> 24:54.530
Sure you can walk
me home, Jimmy.
