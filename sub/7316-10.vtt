00:23.913 --> 00:26.130
McGEE:
Dear Dad,

00:26.173 --> 00:27.608
Merry Christmas Eve.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.347
Because we usually end up
saying the wrong things

00:29.391 --> 00:32.086
when we talk,
in lieu of presents this year,

00:32.130 --> 00:34.826
I'm writing a letter.
Even though a blank page

00:34.869 --> 00:37.217
and a conversation with you
can be equally scary,

00:37.260 --> 00:40.217
I am a published novelist.

00:40.260 --> 00:42.217
I want to tell you
about an unusual case

00:42.260 --> 00:44.260
NCIS had last week,

00:44.304 --> 00:48.086
a case that reminded me of you
because it was about rules.

00:48.130 --> 00:49.739
And, in hindsight,

00:49.782 --> 00:52.304
it's helped me
realize a few things.

00:52.347 --> 00:54.130
About you.

00:54.173 --> 00:57.130
Me. Us.

00:57.173 --> 00:59.000
So here goes.

00:59.043 --> 01:01.260
[horse whinnies on TV] It all started with a news report last week...

01:01.304 --> 01:03.304
[dramatic music playing on TV]

01:13.956 --> 01:18.000
ANNOUNCER:
WJGZ breaking news.

01:18.043 --> 01:20.130
Good evening. I'm Guy Ross.
The nation's capital tonight

01:20.173 --> 01:22.782
is experiencing
a city-wide Internet shutdown.

01:22.826 --> 01:26.217
And WJGZ has just received word
that the interruption

01:26.260 --> 01:30.217
of service may be the result of
a group of coordinated hackers.

01:30.260 --> 01:32.347
Federal authorities say they are
looking into the matter,

01:32.391 --> 01:35.217
but there is no immediate cause
for alarm,

01:35.260 --> 01:37.043
which has many questioning:
is this a coincidence

01:37.086 --> 01:40.043
or is the city
under cyber attack?

01:40.086 --> 01:41.869
Rule 39...

02:17.478 --> 02:21.043
It's no secret you ruled our
house with an iron fist, Dad.

02:21.086 --> 02:23.608
In fact, a coworker
once made a comparison

02:23.652 --> 02:25.652
to the filmThe Great Santini.

02:25.695 --> 02:27.217
I won't name names,

02:27.260 --> 02:29.217
but it was Tony.

02:29.260 --> 02:32.130
You've always questioned
my career choice at NCIS,

02:32.173 --> 02:34.130
but I know
you respect Agent Gibbs

02:34.173 --> 02:37.130
as someone who lives by a set
of rules not to be broken.

02:37.173 --> 02:38.739
For example...

02:39.652 --> 02:40.826
Where's McGee?

02:40.869 --> 02:42.739
I left messages
on his home phone, cell,

02:42.782 --> 02:44.130
and BlackBerry--
no answer.

02:44.173 --> 02:46.000
Rule number three:

02:46.043 --> 02:48.000
"Never be unreachable."

02:48.043 --> 02:49.391
Boss, I'm sorry I'm late.

02:49.434 --> 02:50.739
I couldn't hear my cell.

02:50.782 --> 02:52.000
It won't happen again, boss.

02:52.043 --> 02:53.565
You're right, McGee.
It won't.

02:56.304 --> 02:58.695
Ah, we were so close.

02:58.739 --> 03:00.043
BISHOP:
Yep, less than three hours

03:00.086 --> 03:03.043
from being officially
on holiday leave.

03:03.086 --> 03:05.000
A miracle that would've
been second only

03:05.043 --> 03:07.565
to the birth
of little baby Jesus.Mm-hmm.

03:07.608 --> 03:11.347
Then we get a call at
9:30 on a Saturday night.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.173
Clearly you had big plans.

03:13.217 --> 03:15.086
Are those your pajamas?

03:15.130 --> 03:18.956
In winter, I put my sweats
in the dryer

03:19.000 --> 03:20.434
just before bed,

03:20.478 --> 03:21.956
so that when I get under
the covers, it's warm.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.217
And Gibbs called

03:23.260 --> 03:26.347
and it felt like a waste
not to put 'em on.

03:26.391 --> 03:28.826
Where were you,
the shooting range?

03:28.869 --> 03:30.608
Yes. On a date.

03:30.652 --> 03:32.347
No "Silent Night" for you.

03:32.391 --> 03:33.913
GIBBS:
It will be now.

03:33.956 --> 03:35.434
Okay. What do we know?

03:35.478 --> 03:37.782
Uh, well,
that the civilian Internet

03:37.826 --> 03:40.913
and the military Intranet
are two separate things.

03:40.956 --> 03:42.739
TONY: Yes. The wonderful
laypeople of Washington, DC,

03:42.782 --> 03:44.217
may not have their computers,

03:44.260 --> 03:46.434
but we can still Christmas shop
online.

03:46.478 --> 03:47.782
And why we've been asked
to help.

03:47.826 --> 03:50.739
This is big, Gibbs.
A DDoS attack that crashes

03:50.782 --> 03:52.826
all of DC takes
a massive coordination

03:52.869 --> 03:54.304
of users and botnets.

03:56.347 --> 03:57.913
[no voice]Uh...

04:01.043 --> 04:02.043
So...

04:02.086 --> 04:04.043
pretend that this filing cabinet

04:04.086 --> 04:07.043
is a local service provider,

04:07.086 --> 04:08.869
and you want to
access the Internet.

04:08.913 --> 04:10.173
So...

04:11.217 --> 04:12.521
It's pretend, boss.

04:12.565 --> 04:14.652
Open it.

04:17.652 --> 04:21.608
Except my computer is already
pretending to use that drawer.

04:21.652 --> 04:22.826
Try another one.

04:25.956 --> 04:29.086
Mmm... I am also pretending
to use that drawer, too.

04:30.130 --> 04:31.086
Try another one.

04:31.130 --> 04:33.043
I don't like this game.

04:33.086 --> 04:36.173
Okay, so now imagine hundreds
of hackers doing that

04:36.217 --> 04:38.043
1,000 times a minute.

04:38.086 --> 04:39.347
What is the point?

04:39.391 --> 04:41.782
We don't know.
It's the calm before the storm.

04:41.826 --> 04:43.217
Well, what's the storm?

04:43.260 --> 04:45.086
City infrastructure?
Taking out vital transportation

04:45.130 --> 04:47.217
or power grids?

04:47.260 --> 04:49.347
Or it could be
a targeted data breach.

04:49.391 --> 04:51.826
Washington, DC,
is chock-full of targets.

04:51.869 --> 04:54.913
Which is why cyber divisions
of the FBI, Homeland,

04:54.956 --> 04:56.913
NSA, and Metro are all on

04:56.956 --> 04:59.086
the highest alert.Where is McGee?

04:59.130 --> 05:01.869
He is down
in the cyber basement.Along with everyone else,

05:01.913 --> 05:03.913
looking for answers.
Or a connection.

05:03.956 --> 05:06.869
Or a lead.
Anything, really.Well, it sounds like there are

05:06.913 --> 05:08.826
enough people working
on this one right now, boss.

05:08.869 --> 05:12.043
Yeah, uh, and my sweatpants

05:12.086 --> 05:13.608
are getting cold.

05:13.652 --> 05:16.260
Oh, I do hope
you aren't hinting at leaving.

05:16.304 --> 05:18.000
No, no, no. We're here to work.No, no. I think she was
just talking about...

05:18.043 --> 05:19.521
I'm not a computer
person, so...
Yeah.
Break...

05:19.565 --> 05:21.565
does not start
until we figure out

05:21.608 --> 05:23.347
what the hell
is going on.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.347
Find something!

05:24.391 --> 05:25.826
Fast!

05:25.869 --> 05:27.391
[phone rings]Mm-hmm.

05:27.434 --> 05:29.130
Ooh. I'm gonna go out
on a limb here

05:29.173 --> 05:30.652
and say Abby's got something.

05:30.695 --> 05:32.391
Hey, Abbs, you got something?

05:32.434 --> 05:34.043
Do you think
I'd call you just to chat?

05:34.086 --> 05:35.652
So, how was your date
last night?

05:35.695 --> 05:37.695
It was good. Never got a chance
to reload, though.

05:37.739 --> 05:40.521
Okay, um, I'm sending you
something right now.

05:41.521 --> 05:42.826
Hey, Abbs.
McGee.

05:42.869 --> 05:44.347
You're back already.

05:44.391 --> 05:46.782
Yeah, cyber division
can handle this without me.

05:46.826 --> 05:48.826
Aw, they kicked you out.

05:48.869 --> 05:50.782
So "clique-y" down there.I know.

05:50.826 --> 05:52.869
Besides, all they found was
the username of the guy

05:52.913 --> 05:55.130
who was trying to get all
the hackers together to hit DC.

05:55.173 --> 05:58.043
Message boards. I read them.
It's Krampus.Yep.

05:58.086 --> 06:01.086
Involved in every major U.S.
hack in the last three years,

06:01.130 --> 06:02.782
yet no one's been able
to get close enough to I.D. him.

06:02.826 --> 06:04.521
Luckily, I have
my research.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.695
Vintage Krampus postcards.

06:11.478 --> 06:13.782
McGEE:
This is terrifying.It's German.

06:13.826 --> 06:16.739
So St. Nicholas gives
gifts to the good kids,

06:16.782 --> 06:19.391
and Krampus kidnaps
the bad ones and eats them?

06:19.434 --> 06:22.739
America watered it down
to coal in a sock. Boring.

06:22.782 --> 06:23.913
Is this your research?
No.

06:23.956 --> 06:25.260
[chuckles]
I've been running down

06:25.304 --> 06:27.956
Krampus's history
of hacks and cracks

06:28.000 --> 06:29.782
and phreaks and
spams and smurfs

06:29.826 --> 06:31.739
and general online
mischief and identified

06:31.782 --> 06:33.913
three people
who've had past encounters

06:33.956 --> 06:35.521
with our Christmas demon.

06:35.565 --> 06:37.739
Person of interest A...

06:38.913 --> 06:39.956
I.T. Kevin?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.391
Yeah. He dealt
with Krampus attacks

06:41.434 --> 06:44.000
when he was NCIS
systems administrator.

06:44.043 --> 06:45.608
Yeah, before he tried
to sell

06:45.652 --> 06:47.043
a computer virus to terrorists.

06:47.086 --> 06:50.608
Person of interest B,
Heidi Partridge.

06:50.652 --> 06:52.956
Kindergarten teacher
turned dark webmaster.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.739
ABBY:
And allegedly sold goods

06:54.782 --> 06:58.347
to a user named-- wait for it,
wait for it-- Krampus.

06:58.391 --> 06:59.739
So who's number three?

06:59.782 --> 07:01.913
Ajay Khan.

07:01.956 --> 07:03.695
Former cyber terrorist.

07:03.739 --> 07:05.652
This is the connection
we've been looking for.

07:05.695 --> 07:07.173
These three can tell us
what Krampus has planned.

07:07.217 --> 07:08.695
Abby, we either

07:08.739 --> 07:11.173
put these people in prison
or we made sure they stayed.

07:11.217 --> 07:12.869
It's a bad idea.No, it's not.

07:12.913 --> 07:14.173
Yes, it is.

07:14.217 --> 07:15.782
Gibbs knows
that I speak their language.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.782
He's gonna send me
to talk to 'em.

07:17.826 --> 07:19.434
I'm gonna be in charge.

07:19.478 --> 07:21.434
This could be
the worst Christmas ever.

07:21.478 --> 07:23.173
Come on, McGee,

07:23.217 --> 07:24.695
let your Grinch heart grow.

07:24.739 --> 07:28.086
Abby, listen, please, please
just keep this between us.

07:30.304 --> 07:31.869
Oof.

07:31.913 --> 07:34.043
[indistinct chatter,
phones ringing]

07:35.217 --> 07:39.173
Listen, boss, I know we need
to find this Krampus

07:39.217 --> 07:40.869
before whatever
he's planning happens.

07:40.913 --> 07:42.391
But talking to hackers?

07:42.434 --> 07:43.782
I mean, we're gonna go
to each prison

07:43.826 --> 07:45.173
and talk
to three criminals

07:45.217 --> 07:47.391
who aren't gonna answer
the questions we ask 'em.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.043
I just...

07:49.086 --> 07:50.695
I think it's a waste of time.

07:50.739 --> 07:52.043
I agree.

07:52.086 --> 07:53.173
Really?

07:53.217 --> 07:54.739
Yes. Which is
why they're coming here.

07:54.782 --> 07:56.739
Prison transports
will be here first thing.

07:56.782 --> 07:58.130
Oof.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.739
What? There a problem, Tim?

07:59.782 --> 08:02.695
No, boss.
It's a great plan.

08:03.739 --> 08:05.347
Tony's idea.

08:06.260 --> 08:08.217
So Tony's taking lead on this?

08:08.260 --> 08:09.347
[Gibbs chuckles]

08:09.391 --> 08:10.782
No, you are.

08:10.826 --> 08:12.652
You speak geek.

08:12.695 --> 08:14.565
TONY: Anything to
close this case

08:14.608 --> 08:17.000
and open my vacation--
so go get your binary buddies

08:17.043 --> 08:18.478
to cough up some info,
will you?

08:18.521 --> 08:21.086
Even if it means breaking
rule number one?

08:21.130 --> 08:22.652
Which one?

08:22.695 --> 08:24.000
Both.

08:24.043 --> 08:25.826
Never put
your suspects together,

08:25.869 --> 08:27.434
and never screw over
your partner.

08:28.434 --> 08:30.434
Merry Krampus.

08:41.956 --> 08:44.652
McGEE: We talk a lot about
fathers at NCIS.

08:44.695 --> 08:46.130
And for good reason.

08:46.173 --> 08:48.304
As federal agents,
we not only deal

08:48.347 --> 08:50.043
with the legal code
of justice--

08:50.086 --> 08:52.739
we also have a personal code
of rights and wrongs,

08:52.782 --> 08:54.304
instilled by our parents.

08:54.347 --> 08:55.956
The disciplinary code

08:56.000 --> 08:59.521
of Team Gibbs is heavily influenced by our dads.

08:59.565 --> 09:01.478
Gibbs learned from his father.

09:01.521 --> 09:03.956
Tony's still trying
to figure out his.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.695
I hear Bishop's dad
has rules of his own.

09:06.739 --> 09:09.173
And Ziva's dad was, well,

09:09.217 --> 09:11.173
not kosher.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.739
But now with three criminal
computer hackers coming

09:13.782 --> 09:16.391
into NCIS, it was my turn
to play the parent.

09:16.434 --> 09:20.304
And I must admit, Dad, I saw
shades of you coming through.

09:20.347 --> 09:23.739
What the hell is this?
They're all in one van?

09:23.782 --> 09:26.000
Responsible
government spending.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.043
Oh, why start now?

09:28.086 --> 09:30.739
You know, I didn't
actually think that we were
gonna break rule number one.

09:30.782 --> 09:34.130
We use it to our advantage.
From what I understand, uh,

09:34.173 --> 09:37.739
computer geeks can be
a little competitive.

09:40.956 --> 09:41.913
This sucks.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.217
When are we going back
to prison?

09:43.260 --> 09:44.217
Hey, guys.

09:44.260 --> 09:45.347
Nice to see you.

09:45.391 --> 09:46.956
We're missing
prisoner gift exchange.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.608
KHAN:
And the holiday chow.

09:48.652 --> 09:50.347
This is the only week
we get two rolls.

09:50.391 --> 09:52.565
My gift exchange
isn't until Wednesday,

09:52.608 --> 09:54.391
but I still need to shop
for my cell mate.

09:54.434 --> 09:55.956
He's very... picky.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.565
Shut up and get out
of the truck.

09:57.608 --> 09:58.869
Line up outside the van.

09:58.913 --> 10:02.608
Nobody say anything.
This is voluntary rendition.

10:02.652 --> 10:03.869
My lawyer's checking in
to make sure

10:03.913 --> 10:05.043
that we're still in America!

10:05.086 --> 10:07.565
Inside voices, children.

10:07.608 --> 10:08.956
No talking, inmate.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.782
Oh, I remember you.

10:11.826 --> 10:13.565
You're just the computer nerd.

10:13.608 --> 10:15.043
Who's really
in charge here?

10:15.086 --> 10:16.521
Not Agent Gibbs.

10:16.565 --> 10:18.826
I'm not allowed to be in
his eyeline ever again.Hey.

10:18.869 --> 10:19.956
No talking.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.826
I'm the one in charge,

10:21.869 --> 10:24.173
and you're gonna respect
this badge or else

10:24.217 --> 10:25.695
you'll never...

10:25.739 --> 10:27.782
get another roll again
in your life.

10:29.347 --> 10:31.086
[whispers]:
Don't let 'em get to you.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.086
Which is easier said than done.

10:33.130 --> 10:35.304
That's why
it's rule number ten.

10:35.347 --> 10:37.304
When did you start caring
about the rules?

10:37.347 --> 10:39.521
My rules.Yeah? Which ones?

10:39.565 --> 10:41.173
Rule ten.

10:41.217 --> 10:43.826
Never get personally involved
on a case.

10:43.869 --> 10:45.652
I think I killed someone, Tim.

10:45.695 --> 10:47.782
Sarah, I'm a federal agent.
I have a responsibility.

10:47.826 --> 10:49.478
Tim, I didn't come
to a federal agent.

10:49.521 --> 10:51.086
I came to my big brother.

10:51.130 --> 10:52.869
Forgive me, Director,
for not putting the integrity

10:52.913 --> 10:55.739
of NCIS before my sister.

10:56.652 --> 10:57.956
It won't happen again.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.608
And this is...?

11:00.652 --> 11:02.869
A peace offering
while you're here.

11:08.695 --> 11:11.000
Ugh... trade me.

11:11.043 --> 11:13.043
These are too small
and jingoistic.

11:13.086 --> 11:14.391
Oh, no, actually, those
are mine from my locker.

11:14.434 --> 11:16.000
He won't want them.

11:16.043 --> 11:19.043
Oh, I'd be more than happy to
get in your pants, Agent Bishop.

11:19.086 --> 11:20.565
HEIDI:
Imagine,

11:20.608 --> 11:22.043
a horny computer geek.

11:22.086 --> 11:23.434
Oh, it's an
open invitation.

11:23.478 --> 11:25.565
I can be hot
for kindergarten teacher.

11:25.608 --> 11:28.217
[sighing, groaning]

11:30.086 --> 11:31.347
What's that
supposed to mean?

11:31.391 --> 11:32.652
Exactly what it says.

11:32.695 --> 11:35.782
No CP for you
and you and you.

11:35.826 --> 11:36.782
It's also

11:36.826 --> 11:38.043
an obscure film reference--

11:38.086 --> 11:39.043
Breakfast Club.

11:39.086 --> 11:41.347
More old movies? Move on, man.

11:41.391 --> 11:42.608
If we can't use computers,

11:42.652 --> 11:44.565
how are we supposed
to help you I.D. Krampus?

11:46.043 --> 11:47.565
We can't anyway.

11:47.608 --> 11:49.608
Because we don't know anything.

11:50.695 --> 11:52.695
Kevin...

11:52.739 --> 11:54.173
Hey.

11:54.217 --> 11:55.652
[whispering]: We talked about
this in the van, man.

11:56.391 --> 11:57.652
Come on, Kev.

11:57.695 --> 11:59.608
Don't side with them.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.565
It's the first day
of prison all over again.

12:01.608 --> 12:02.956
Come on, man.

12:03.000 --> 12:03.956
Come on!

12:04.000 --> 12:06.086
Okay.

12:06.130 --> 12:07.260
Kevin...

12:07.304 --> 12:08.652
Only because it's true.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.565
I wish I knew
something to help.

12:10.608 --> 12:12.739
Oh, come on!
Are you such hardened criminals

12:12.782 --> 12:15.173
that you don't care
about anyone on the outside?

12:15.217 --> 12:17.043
Mm.
Eh.
Mm.

12:17.086 --> 12:19.478
You all know Krampus.HEIDI:
Knew him.

12:19.521 --> 12:22.043
People convicted of computer
crimes don't get Internet

12:22.086 --> 12:25.478
privileges in jail, and I've
been in for over a year now.

12:25.521 --> 12:26.869
Two years.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.000
Three months, but the first
months are really hard.

12:29.043 --> 12:30.304
Anyway,

12:30.347 --> 12:33.565
the point is, boys and girls,
in Internet years,

12:33.608 --> 12:35.478
we've been out of contact
with our world

12:35.521 --> 12:37.130
and your hacker for decades.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.478
Until we get computers,
or access to the MTAC.

12:39.521 --> 12:41.000
Mm-hmm.
[laughs]
Yeah.

12:41.043 --> 12:43.347
HEIDI:
The Internet's out citywide.

12:43.391 --> 12:44.826
You wouldn't have brought us in

12:44.869 --> 12:46.826
unless something bigger
was about to happen.

12:46.869 --> 12:50.826
We might be willing to
figure out what that is.

12:50.869 --> 12:52.695
Mm-hmm.

12:52.739 --> 12:55.869
[phone ringing]

12:55.913 --> 12:57.782
Ah. Yeah, boss.

12:57.826 --> 13:00.130
[Gibbs speaking indistinctly]TONY: Uh-huh.

13:00.173 --> 13:03.217
Okay, got it.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.869
The attack?
Do we know what it is?

13:05.913 --> 13:07.652
It's over.

13:11.478 --> 13:13.043
[elevator bell dings]

13:13.086 --> 13:14.608
The Internet's back on?!

13:14.652 --> 13:16.826
The real Internet,
for the huddled DC masses?

13:16.869 --> 13:18.391
I didn't touch anything.

13:18.434 --> 13:19.782
But it does mean the hackers get

13:19.826 --> 13:21.826
to go back to jail,
which is great news.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.173
It's weird news.

13:23.217 --> 13:25.173
I mean, there were
no residual effects?

13:25.217 --> 13:26.695
Bad guys didn't leave
anything behind?

13:26.739 --> 13:28.130
No viruses? Nothing?

13:28.173 --> 13:30.434
No. I mean,
the attacks just slowed down

13:30.478 --> 13:31.826
and then eventually stopped.

13:31.869 --> 13:33.391
I'm running
server tests now.

13:33.434 --> 13:35.043
I don't know, McGee.

13:35.086 --> 13:36.826
I just feel like we're getting
played here, like we're gonna

13:36.869 --> 13:38.391
wake up
on Christmas morning, and...

13:38.434 --> 13:40.043
[phone ringing]...all the trees
and presents

13:40.086 --> 13:41.608
in Whoville are
gonna be gone.

13:42.434 --> 13:43.869
Oh, Sarah.

13:43.913 --> 13:45.391
Do you have Christmas plans
with the family?

13:45.434 --> 13:47.826
Yep, the whole fam,
including Dad.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.652
Oh, that's good.

13:49.695 --> 13:52.608
So, are his chemotherapy
treatments working?

13:52.652 --> 13:54.652
[computer chiming, blipping]

13:54.695 --> 13:56.260
Oh, server test
came back.

13:58.565 --> 14:00.521
Uh-oh.
I knew it!

14:00.565 --> 14:03.478
A single server farm in
Anacostia is still under attack.

14:03.521 --> 14:06.434
Why would all the other attacks
just stop?

14:07.739 --> 14:10.565
Unless we arebeing played.

14:10.608 --> 14:13.000
McGEE:
Rules number 36 and 40.

14:13.043 --> 14:15.391
And then, of course, there's
my favorite rule, number 36.

14:15.434 --> 14:17.391
If you feel like
you're being played,

14:17.434 --> 14:19.391
you probably are.

14:19.434 --> 14:21.043
Gibbs mentioned rule 40.

14:21.086 --> 14:22.391
If you think someone's out
to get you, they are?

14:22.434 --> 14:25.000
This one is just addressed
to "NCIS Special Agent."

14:25.043 --> 14:26.434
I think that's
mine, McGee.

14:28.913 --> 14:30.434
Evacuate, get everybody
out of here.

14:30.478 --> 14:31.434
Abbs!
Oh!

14:38.434 --> 14:40.521
McGEE:
Suffering the consequences
of the rules is like

14:40.565 --> 14:42.521
being sent to your room
without dinner.

14:42.565 --> 14:44.434
You know, Dad,
when you did that,

14:44.478 --> 14:47.391
Mom always brought me
a grilled ham-and-cheese

14:47.434 --> 14:50.086
20 minutes later.

14:50.130 --> 14:52.434
But your punishments
still stung.

14:52.478 --> 14:54.956
However, as a kid,
I never realized

14:55.000 --> 14:57.565
that enforcing the rules
can feel just as bad.

14:57.608 --> 14:59.565
You don't want
to be the bad guy,

14:59.608 --> 15:01.826
and whether you're sending kids to their room

15:01.869 --> 15:04.695
or criminals to prison,
sometimes it has to be done.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.217
Gibbs! Gibbs!
Gibbs! Gibbs! Gibbs!

15:07.260 --> 15:08.652
The citywide attack was just

15:08.695 --> 15:11.043
Krampus's little helpers
causing a distraction

15:11.086 --> 15:13.043
so he could hack a lone server.

15:13.086 --> 15:15.391
We know what he's after, boss.Congressional e-mails?

15:15.434 --> 15:17.739
ABBY: Krampus wants
to send a message

15:17.782 --> 15:19.086
to the naughty U.S. government.

15:19.130 --> 15:20.695
KHAN:
More leaked crotch pics!

15:20.739 --> 15:22.391
Finally, truth
in Washington.

15:22.434 --> 15:24.000
McGEE:
Hey, government

15:24.043 --> 15:26.913
e-mail accounts contain more
than just lewd selfies, okay?

15:26.956 --> 15:28.260
ABBY:
Yeah, there's deployments

15:28.304 --> 15:31.173
and anti-terrorist
strategy memos.

15:31.217 --> 15:34.130
Giving ISIS a Christmas present
this good, they might convert.

15:34.173 --> 15:35.434
Good luck with
that, sweet cheeks.

15:35.478 --> 15:36.521
Stop!

15:36.565 --> 15:38.521
Thanks, Gibbs,
but I can handle myself.

15:38.565 --> 15:39.652
No, not him. You.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.086
They're not going anywhere.

15:44.130 --> 15:46.347
Boss, they're-they're
talented hackers,

15:46.391 --> 15:48.478
but we can't let
them near a computer.

15:48.521 --> 15:50.260
How else are
they gonna help?

15:50.304 --> 15:52.478
Figure it out, McGee.

15:52.521 --> 15:55.304
Don't waste good.

15:55.347 --> 15:57.043
McGEE:
That's rule number five.

15:57.086 --> 15:58.695
Sometimes it's hard
to tell the difference

15:58.739 --> 16:00.695
between rules and punishments.

16:00.739 --> 16:02.913
Go.

16:10.652 --> 16:12.478
Where did Tony
and the hot one go?

16:12.521 --> 16:14.304
KEVIN:
The team likely went to go
check out the server farm.

16:14.347 --> 16:15.956
Standard procedure.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.869
You wish
you were there, daddy-o?

16:17.913 --> 16:19.260
KEVIN:
Server technicians
would have taken

16:19.304 --> 16:21.739
the entire place offline
after NCIS discovered

16:21.782 --> 16:23.217
it was the target.

16:23.260 --> 16:25.130
Yeah, 12 hours later.
Krampus has the data.

16:25.173 --> 16:26.478
It's just a matter of when

16:26.521 --> 16:28.304
he releases it.
You need to get us online.

16:28.347 --> 16:30.217
Or the intel leaks,

16:30.260 --> 16:32.173
and the country sees
Congress's ineptitude.

16:32.217 --> 16:33.608
Win-win.

16:33.652 --> 16:35.608
KEVIN: If I were them,
I wouldn't let you guys

16:35.652 --> 16:37.130
near computers, either.

16:37.173 --> 16:40.043
What? You werethem,
which makes you a traitor.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.434
[phone chimes]

16:42.478 --> 16:44.217
[beep]

16:51.086 --> 16:53.043
If they move, shoot 'em.KHAN: Hey!

16:53.086 --> 16:55.565
If you're not gonna talk to us,
why the hell are we in here?

16:55.608 --> 16:57.217
I want my two rolls!

16:57.260 --> 16:59.391
Your "roll" is staying
out of the way.

17:01.043 --> 17:05.173
McGEE:
Of course, rules are up
for interpretation.

17:05.217 --> 17:08.478
Gibbs's rules aren't just
for being a good agent,

17:08.521 --> 17:11.000
no more than your rules
about not using the kitchen

17:11.043 --> 17:13.652
for science projects
were about food safety, Dad.

17:16.913 --> 17:19.869
So, the dead guy was
at the server farm, huh?

17:19.913 --> 17:21.652
Hooked up to a utility box.

17:21.695 --> 17:23.652
Hacking servers using
on-site data lines

17:23.695 --> 17:25.869
is risky and unusual, but...

17:25.913 --> 17:27.173
It possible?

17:27.217 --> 17:28.782
It is that magic time of year

17:28.826 --> 17:30.043
when anything's possible.

17:30.086 --> 17:32.043
McGEE: Who is he?GIBBS: Uh, no I.D.

17:32.086 --> 17:34.043
His prints aren't
in the system.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.782
You recognize him?

17:35.826 --> 17:38.130
Boss, that's not how
anonymous message boards

17:38.173 --> 17:41.173
and hackers usually work.

17:41.217 --> 17:42.521
No, don't recognize him.

17:42.565 --> 17:44.434
Ducky's got the body in Autopsy?

17:44.478 --> 17:46.217
KHAN:
Field trip!

17:46.260 --> 17:49.304
Who wants to
see a dead body?

17:49.347 --> 17:51.347
McGEE:
What are you guys
doing out here?

17:51.391 --> 17:52.956
I told you to shoot 'em.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.260
Uh, my idea, Tim.

17:54.304 --> 17:55.695
HEIDI:
Those are sorry excuses

17:55.739 --> 17:57.086
for personal
computers.

17:57.130 --> 17:58.478
Nice monitors.

17:58.521 --> 18:00.000
They're government issued.

18:00.043 --> 18:02.043
By the First
Continental Congress?

18:02.086 --> 18:03.173
[Khan laughs]

18:03.217 --> 18:05.173
Hey, MTAC.

18:05.217 --> 18:06.913
Bet the monitors
are newer in there.

18:06.956 --> 18:08.086
Not really.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.260
Enough. You're gonna
identify the body.

18:10.304 --> 18:12.043
Come on, bring 'em down.

18:12.086 --> 18:16.304
Wait-- boss, you want them
to go to Autopsy?

18:16.347 --> 18:18.347
People online don't know
what each other look like.

18:18.391 --> 18:20.000
It's-it's anonymous,
it's impersonal.

18:20.043 --> 18:24.043
Tim, it's about to
get very personal.

18:24.086 --> 18:28.347
The mean and very
raggedy-looking Belsnickel,

18:28.391 --> 18:30.173
Knecht Ruprecht
with his bag of ashes.

18:30.217 --> 18:32.391
Oh, and the creature-like

18:32.434 --> 18:34.913
Krampus with his rusty nails...

18:34.956 --> 18:37.086
[groans]
and chains and bells.
I mean, what better way

18:37.130 --> 18:39.347
to show the light
of Father Christmas

18:39.391 --> 18:42.434
than to examine
the dark alternatives?

18:42.478 --> 18:43.739
GIBBS:
Cause of death, Duck?

18:43.782 --> 18:45.130
Uh, well, organs

18:45.173 --> 18:48.434
show signs of malnutrition
and enlargement.

18:48.478 --> 18:50.043
They are consistent
with exhaustion

18:50.086 --> 18:51.826
and high blood
pressure.

18:51.869 --> 18:54.043
A heart attack is
not out of the question.

18:54.086 --> 18:56.304
KHAN: I read about
a South Korean dude

18:56.347 --> 18:59.260
who died from playing video
games for 27 days straight.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.869
Urban legend.

19:00.913 --> 19:05.000
No, no, no, no, what Mr. Khan
is saying is possible.

19:05.043 --> 19:07.043
Prolonged lack of sleep
and improper nutrition

19:07.086 --> 19:09.521
cause immense stresses
on the body.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.130
KEVIN:
So, did this guy die while

19:11.173 --> 19:12.869
extreme hacking the servers?

19:12.913 --> 19:14.869
Oh, it's inconclusive thus far.

19:14.913 --> 19:16.913
But I have estimated
the time of death

19:16.956 --> 19:18.956
as late last night
or early this morning.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.956
Oh, Krampus called in the threat
to the media at 10:00 a.m.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.478
Mm.
It's not him.

19:23.521 --> 19:26.304
No, if he was hacking on-site,
he'd have a computer with him.

19:26.347 --> 19:27.956
Right.
It would help I.D. him,
Agent Gibbs.

19:30.956 --> 19:33.608
In the snow, all night long.

19:33.652 --> 19:35.869
That's gonna need
to be dried out before using.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.391
Six to eight hours.Yeah, more like 12.

19:37.434 --> 19:38.826
HEIDI: Well, not if
it's a solid-state drive.

19:38.869 --> 19:40.217
It wouldn't take as long.

19:40.260 --> 19:42.043
We can't afford to wait around
while Krampus decides

19:42.086 --> 19:44.086
when and where to leak
the sensitive intel.

19:44.130 --> 19:46.260
This guy's not Krampus.
He works for him.

19:46.304 --> 19:48.086
A lackey.KHAN: Right,
but if we can I.D. dead guy,

19:48.130 --> 19:50.521
we connect him
to Krampus, and...

19:50.565 --> 19:52.043
[Khan laughs]

19:52.086 --> 19:54.130
Not that we care.

19:54.173 --> 19:55.956
No, never thought you did.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.173
We're the bad guys,
remember?

19:59.782 --> 20:02.782
Even Santa Claus needs
a team of elves.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.565
McGEE:
Another Gibbs rule.

20:04.608 --> 20:05.782
SHEPARD:
Rule number 15--

20:05.826 --> 20:06.956
always work as a team.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.869
Okay, more left.

20:08.913 --> 20:10.739
[grunting, Tony bellowing]

20:12.086 --> 20:12.869
Oh.

20:12.913 --> 20:13.956
Oh.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.130
[grunting]

20:15.173 --> 20:16.347
Oh, come on.

20:17.130 --> 20:19.347
Aah! It's about time.

20:22.434 --> 20:24.956
I love you, McGee.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.304
So, I guess this whole teamwork
thing is out the window?

20:28.347 --> 20:30.000
No way!

20:30.043 --> 20:32.043
Working together
is always better.

20:32.086 --> 20:34.086
Then why did Agent Gibbs
leave us down here?

20:34.130 --> 20:35.347
And why won't you

20:35.391 --> 20:36.869
let us into your lab?

20:36.913 --> 20:37.913
Hey!

20:37.956 --> 20:39.521
Stay in the line of sight.

20:39.565 --> 20:40.739
I'm confused.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.217
Do you trust
us or not?

20:42.260 --> 20:45.739
It's like... A Christmas Carol.

20:45.782 --> 20:48.478
Scrooge was shown all
the facts, and what

20:48.521 --> 20:50.478
he does with them is up to him.

20:50.521 --> 20:51.826
So, we're-we're Scrooge?

20:51.869 --> 20:53.956
We're supposed to just
have a change of heart?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.739
HEIDI:
Because we don't know anything.

20:55.782 --> 20:58.260
So, can we just skip
to Christmas future?

20:58.304 --> 21:00.260
If only wishing made it so.

21:00.304 --> 21:02.347
[phone chimes]

21:02.391 --> 21:03.826
Another dead body?

21:03.869 --> 21:05.434
No, it's my sister.

21:05.478 --> 21:07.043
We're coordinating
Christmas presents.

21:07.086 --> 21:09.608
Hey, uh, you
never did say

21:09.652 --> 21:13.043
how your dad's doing
on his treatments.

21:13.086 --> 21:15.695
Well, chemo worked
until it didn't.

21:15.739 --> 21:17.347
Surgery is our only option now.

21:17.391 --> 21:19.913
Luckily, he's got one this week.

21:19.956 --> 21:23.782
That's why you didn't want
to do all this.

21:23.826 --> 21:26.086
McGee, you should have
said something.

21:26.130 --> 21:28.565
HEIDI:
It's a Christmas miracle!

21:28.608 --> 21:30.260
You're gonna want to see this.

21:40.347 --> 21:41.521
Are those...?

21:41.565 --> 21:42.913
New computer monitors.

21:42.956 --> 21:44.956
How long have they been
in there?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.565
This invoice is dated
three years ago.

21:46.608 --> 21:48.391
And it just says "Bullpen."

21:48.434 --> 21:50.478

21:52.521 --> 21:54.608
Can't talk

21:54.652 --> 21:56.434
McGEE:
Because rules number three
and eight

21:56.478 --> 21:57.869
just came into play, Dad.

21:57.913 --> 22:00.130
Rule number three:
Don't believe what you're told.

22:00.173 --> 22:01.826
Double check.

22:01.869 --> 22:03.739
Rule number eight is going
to save you, McGee.

22:03.782 --> 22:05.043
TONY:
Never date a co-worker?

22:05.086 --> 22:06.913
Never go anywhere
without your knife.

22:06.956 --> 22:08.826
TONY:
I thought that was nine.

22:08.869 --> 22:09.826
Never take anything
for granted.

22:09.869 --> 22:11.478
McGEE:
It's just occurred to me

22:11.521 --> 22:15.086
that rules number three, eight, 36 and 40 are the same thing.

22:15.130 --> 22:18.826
And with two rule number ones
and two number threes,

22:18.869 --> 22:22.956
I'm starting to question that
these are honest mistakes.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.478
Is Gibbs making up these rules
as he goes?

22:25.521 --> 22:26.913
Do all parents?

22:26.956 --> 22:28.304
TONY:
So...

22:28.347 --> 22:29.739
Heidi lied to us, boss.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.086
Turns out she was
granted an hour

22:31.130 --> 22:32.739
of unsupervised computer use,
for good behavior.

22:32.782 --> 22:34.956
"Supervised" doesn't
mean monitored.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.913
GIBBS: Pull prison
computer records.
Already did.

22:38.869 --> 22:41.434
Heidi has been using
an anonymous message board.

22:41.478 --> 22:44.695
The prison's site blocker
missed it, but I didn't.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.043
Who'd she talk to?Well,

22:46.086 --> 22:47.608
I used the prison
computers' key logger,

22:47.652 --> 22:50.217
so we only know
what she typed.

22:51.260 --> 22:53.217
Krampus.

22:53.260 --> 22:54.739
Heidi played matchmaker.

22:54.782 --> 22:56.739
Hooked him up
with her underground contacts

22:56.782 --> 22:58.434
to coordinate
the citywide attack.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.391
Location?

23:00.434 --> 23:01.826
More untraceable usernames.

23:01.869 --> 23:03.826
But it does prove
that Heidi knows Krampus.

23:03.869 --> 23:05.782
She could lead us to him.

23:05.826 --> 23:07.608
Could, but hasn't.

23:08.869 --> 23:12.391
No, not yet.

[mellow Christmas jazz plays]

23:25.217 --> 23:27.173
McGEE:
If you're lost, Dad,
let me recap.

23:27.217 --> 23:30.130
Sensitive intel was stolen
from a downed Internet server

23:30.173 --> 23:31.695
by a hacker named Krampus.

23:31.739 --> 23:35.695
If leaked, national security
would be at risk.

23:35.739 --> 23:37.391
So we brought in
three criminal hackers

23:37.434 --> 23:39.347
to help track down Krampus,

23:39.391 --> 23:41.565
although they've done
anything but.

23:41.608 --> 23:43.608
In fact,
we just discovered one of them

23:43.652 --> 23:45.260
has been in recent contact
with him,

23:45.304 --> 23:46.956
and is fully aware
of his plot.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.565
Our only advantage is that she
doesn't know we're onto her.

from your lawyer.

Come on.

23:57.217 --> 23:58.565
Ah.

23:58.608 --> 23:59.913

You're going
to the conference room.

McGEE:
Did I accuse you of making up
parenting strategies

24:06.347 --> 24:08.260
as you went along, Dad?

24:08.304 --> 24:11.043
Well, I'm beginning
to understand the feeling,

24:11.086 --> 24:14.434
because we were about to trust
a convicted cyber criminal.

24:14.478 --> 24:16.173
Where's my phone call?

24:20.086 --> 24:22.565
Wait a minute, there is no call
from my lawyer, is there?

24:23.782 --> 24:24.956
GIBBS:
Nope.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.521
This another ruse?

24:27.565 --> 24:29.478
Yes, it is.

But this time
you'll be in on it.

24:33.652 --> 24:36.565
Krampus is still out there,

24:36.608 --> 24:38.652

to be creative.

Oh, creative--

I was about to be murdered

24:48.869 --> 24:50.565
Not in the least.

to barter with.

As a team,

26:29.043 --> 26:30.608
there are rules
we choose to ignore

26:30.652 --> 26:33.347
because the benefits promise
to outweigh consequences.

26:33.391 --> 26:35.086
Number 22 is one of them.

26:35.130 --> 26:37.043

Never, ever bother Gibbs

Cause of death wasn't simply
from prolonged

but from a rare disease

called fatal
familial insomnia.

Also known as the

27:20.695 --> 27:22.434
When the disease
first presented itself,

27:22.478 --> 27:25.130
it might've been seen as a bonus
to a hacker.

27:25.173 --> 27:26.695
Until weeks of sleeplessness

27:26.739 --> 27:30.043
took a toll on his body
and it shut down.

Usually the patient falls
into a coma and dies.

27:32.434 --> 27:36.347
But, in this case,
heart failure got him first.

27:36.391 --> 27:37.913
You said it was rare.

that he had the disease, but...

Lyle was five years old.

27:55.521 --> 27:57.434
collecting computers
and cell phones,

27:57.478 --> 27:59.130
and anything to
lead us to Krampus.

27:59.173 --> 28:01.695
Who, good news,
hasn't leaked any intel.

28:01.739 --> 28:05.608
Only because, bad news,
he's putting it up for bid.

28:05.652 --> 28:09.043
Everyone from TMZ to ISIS
is licking their chops.

28:09.086 --> 28:10.739
Can't wait for them
to pay up, Abbs.

28:10.782 --> 28:12.739
Means the deal with Khan
still stands?

28:12.782 --> 28:14.956
Unless you give me
something first.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.478
McGEE:
I have to admit that Abby

28:16.521 --> 28:19.043
is another example
of a rule often broken

28:19.086 --> 28:21.826
by our team: rule number 12.

28:21.869 --> 28:23.260
Never date a co-worker.

28:23.304 --> 28:24.608
Hello, Jethro.

28:28.086 --> 28:30.913
â™ª

28:30.956 --> 28:32.608
He stay at your place?Yep.

28:32.652 --> 28:34.086
You sleep
in the coffin, McGee?

28:34.130 --> 28:36.347
[scoffs] I can't believe
I slept in a coffin.

28:36.391 --> 28:38.086
Not just slept.

28:38.130 --> 28:40.347
[moaning]

28:40.391 --> 28:43.608
McGEE: But every rule
exists for a reason...

28:45.260 --> 28:48.652
...because it can come back
to bite you, or worse.

28:48.695 --> 28:51.173
I found those
nice new monitors for you.

28:51.217 --> 28:53.434
I thought we'd use them.

28:53.478 --> 28:55.043
How do you read
these things?

28:55.086 --> 28:57.043
Look, don't make us regret
letting you in here.

28:57.086 --> 28:59.217
I regret agreeing to the terms.

28:59.260 --> 29:01.347
BISHOP:
All right, Maryland forensic lab
just posted a copy

29:01.391 --> 29:03.217
of Lyle Trigget's hard drive.

29:03.260 --> 29:04.608
You type like
an eighth-grader.

29:04.652 --> 29:06.478
You smell like horny concrete.

29:06.521 --> 29:08.217
KEVIN:
Uh, Tony, you can't do that.

29:08.260 --> 29:09.652
Why not?If we're trying to create

29:09.695 --> 29:11.043
an undercover
message board alias

29:11.086 --> 29:13.434
to infiltrate chat rooms,
you can't make

29:13.478 --> 29:15.130
your username Serpico73.

29:15.173 --> 29:17.347
Why not?Pacino was a cop.

29:17.391 --> 29:21.478
Yeah. That way,
they will never suspect me.

29:21.521 --> 29:23.434
Girlfriend?

29:23.478 --> 29:24.695
Sister.

29:24.739 --> 29:26.826
Sarah, hey, listen,
I can't talk right now.

29:26.869 --> 29:28.130
I'm in the middle of...

29:28.173 --> 29:30.434
Wait, what?

29:30.478 --> 29:32.173
When?

29:32.217 --> 29:34.217
Why didn't he tell us?

29:35.782 --> 29:38.652
Well, I can't be there
right now.

29:38.695 --> 29:39.739
[McGee sighs]

29:39.782 --> 29:41.000
Talk to him.

29:41.043 --> 29:42.739
I have to go.

29:42.782 --> 29:45.260
That didn't sound like
Christmas-present coordination.

29:45.304 --> 29:46.565
No, it didn't.

29:46.608 --> 29:50.043
Told you, every word
these guys say is a lie.

29:50.086 --> 29:51.782
McGEE:
It's not about presents, okay?

29:51.826 --> 29:55.739
My father cancelled his surgery
and instead of me being there

29:55.782 --> 29:58.217
to convince him otherwise,
I'm stuck here with all of you.

30:02.608 --> 30:04.739
HEIDI:
Well...

30:04.782 --> 30:06.391
I need a bathroom break.

30:06.434 --> 30:08.086
Agent Gibbs,

30:08.130 --> 30:10.130
may I have a hall pass?

30:12.913 --> 30:14.391
Door's right over there.

30:14.434 --> 30:17.521
No detours.
Okay.

30:17.565 --> 30:19.086
Don't get lost.

30:19.130 --> 30:21.260
Okay.

30:25.478 --> 30:26.913
KHAN [quietly]:
Hey.

30:26.956 --> 30:28.217
Here's my chance.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.217
Give me the phone.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.826
Our deal.

30:30.869 --> 30:32.913
The restrooms are right next
to each other. Come on.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.260
Forget about it.

30:34.304 --> 30:36.304
Hey, come...

30:36.347 --> 30:39.043
Dude, look, about your dad,
I'm sorry.

30:39.086 --> 30:40.260
Okay, I am.

30:40.304 --> 30:42.652
But I can do this.

30:51.608 --> 30:52.652
Shh.

30:52.695 --> 30:54.304
What the hell are you doing?

30:54.347 --> 30:56.956
[quietly]:
Bathroom break.

30:58.173 --> 31:00.086
I don't think they saw me.

31:00.130 --> 31:02.608
What do you want?

31:02.652 --> 31:04.695
Um, mm...

31:05.782 --> 31:07.478
To make out.

31:07.521 --> 31:10.391
[snickers]
Yeah.

31:10.434 --> 31:13.086
What's in it for me?

31:13.130 --> 31:14.826
Hmm...

31:14.869 --> 31:16.695
Oh.

31:16.739 --> 31:18.260
Oh.

31:18.304 --> 31:20.043
McGEE:
No activity yet.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.043
KEVIN:
You made a deal with Khan?

31:22.086 --> 31:23.043
I think I would've been
a better option.

31:23.086 --> 31:24.695
Shh!
Shh!

31:24.739 --> 31:26.565
Phone's on.

31:28.565 --> 31:30.217
Why is she using the camera?

31:30.260 --> 31:32.478
Is this part of the plan?

31:32.521 --> 31:33.478
Oh, no.

31:33.521 --> 31:35.565
[Tony groans]

31:35.608 --> 31:37.826
Boss.

31:37.869 --> 31:39.000
Ew.

31:41.130 --> 31:43.000
He double-crossed us.

31:43.043 --> 31:44.391
McGEE: Like I said, Dad,
a lot of things

31:44.434 --> 31:45.565
can come back to bite you.

31:48.521 --> 31:50.086
KHAN:
Hey.

31:51.391 --> 31:53.043
GIBBS:
Gift exchange is over.

31:53.086 --> 31:55.086
I was just getting started.

31:55.130 --> 31:56.608
Tell me about it.[Heidi giggles]

31:56.652 --> 31:58.086
I need a cold shower.

31:58.130 --> 32:00.173
Ooh, that wasn't part
of our deal.

32:00.217 --> 32:02.173
[laughing]
You told her?

32:02.217 --> 32:04.521
[panting]:
Well, like you said,

32:04.565 --> 32:05.521
I'm me.

32:05.565 --> 32:07.521
Furlough free time is over.

32:07.565 --> 32:08.521
I want a lawyer.

32:08.565 --> 32:10.521
McGEE:
Gibbs's rule number 13:

32:10.565 --> 32:12.782
Never involve lawyers.

32:12.826 --> 32:13.869
Sorry.

32:13.913 --> 32:14.956
[laughs]

32:15.000 --> 32:16.652
Rule number 42:

32:16.695 --> 32:18.173
Never accept an apology
from someone

32:18.217 --> 32:20.608
who just sucker-punched you.

32:33.304 --> 32:35.086
[phone chimes]

32:35.130 --> 32:37.043
Guess that visit
to MTAC is out.

32:38.434 --> 32:40.086
You mad, bro?

32:40.130 --> 32:42.086
I'm disappointed.

32:42.130 --> 32:44.217
I'm done with all of you.

32:47.086 --> 32:50.043
A parent makes the rules
to help.

32:50.086 --> 32:52.043
But you can't
force kids to follow them,

32:52.086 --> 32:54.217
no matter how hard you try.

32:54.260 --> 32:56.434
They have to make
their own choices.

32:56.478 --> 32:58.043
I suppose I owe you an apology

32:58.086 --> 33:00.739
for those times, Dad.

33:00.782 --> 33:03.826
Which is breaking
yet another rule, actually.

33:04.913 --> 33:08.434
Douglas VonDorothy. AKA Krampus.

33:08.478 --> 33:10.000
You found him?

33:10.043 --> 33:11.565
Yes. With Abby.

33:11.608 --> 33:13.521
Our dead guy
in autopsy kept records

33:13.565 --> 33:15.782
of his message board
chats with Krampus.

33:15.826 --> 33:17.391
They gave away
personal details--

33:17.434 --> 33:19.304
hobbies,
regional indicators.

33:19.347 --> 33:21.130
Info that you could track
on social media

33:21.173 --> 33:22.304
to get real names.Mm-hmm.

33:22.347 --> 33:23.434
Only one of which had

33:23.478 --> 33:24.782
a criminal record
for computer crimes

33:24.826 --> 33:26.521
and fit what we already

33:26.565 --> 33:27.956
knew about Krampus.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.043
Where is he?

33:29.086 --> 33:30.956
Uh, photos on his
EveryoneIEverMet.com

33:31.000 --> 33:33.869
profile show him
in Rice Lake, Wisconsin.

33:33.913 --> 33:35.913
His parents own a cabin there.

33:35.956 --> 33:38.043
It's cold, but isolated.

33:38.086 --> 33:39.695
FBI field office in Chicago?

33:39.739 --> 33:41.217
Make the call.

33:41.260 --> 33:43.260
Let's just hope he hasn't
found a buyer yet.

33:47.434 --> 33:48.565
Problem, Tim?

33:48.608 --> 33:50.869
Always be specific when you lie.

33:50.913 --> 33:53.652
People that hide online
know that better than anyone.

33:53.695 --> 33:55.304
Boss, this feels...Too easy?

33:55.347 --> 33:56.652
Yeah.

33:56.695 --> 33:58.608
If they show up
in Wisconsin and Krampus

33:58.652 --> 34:00.347
isn't there, he's gonna
disappear with the intel.

34:00.391 --> 34:01.695
Hold on.

34:01.739 --> 34:03.695
Am I sending FBI SWAT
to Wisconsin?

34:09.086 --> 34:10.130
Let's ask her.

34:10.173 --> 34:11.652
Who, Heidi?

34:11.695 --> 34:12.913
Why would she talk now?

34:12.956 --> 34:15.478
Show her who she's protecting.

34:17.043 --> 34:18.652
Boss, can you give that
to someone else?

34:21.086 --> 34:23.043
I can't take it anymore.

34:23.086 --> 34:25.217
I said from the beginning
that this wasn't gonna work.

34:25.260 --> 34:26.913
These...
It's a waste

34:26.956 --> 34:29.043
of time.
These guys are criminals.

34:29.086 --> 34:31.086
They're not worth it.

34:32.913 --> 34:34.739
McGee...

34:38.695 --> 34:40.217
...rule 51.

34:40.260 --> 34:42.130
Fifty-one?

34:42.173 --> 34:43.521
What is...

34:46.086 --> 34:48.739
I wrote it down once.

34:58.043 --> 34:59.695
That's who you're protecting.

34:59.739 --> 35:01.956
Is there anything you want
to tell us before the FBI

35:02.000 --> 35:04.695
get to Wisconsin
and arrest him?

35:04.739 --> 35:06.869
You still don't have
anything else to say?

35:06.913 --> 35:07.869
Kevin, you wanted to help.

35:07.913 --> 35:10.000
Now's your chance.

35:10.043 --> 35:12.304
Read his record.Yes. Anything.

35:12.347 --> 35:15.869
Finally.

35:15.913 --> 35:17.782
"Douglas VonDorothy:

35:17.826 --> 35:19.956
"while not shutting down
cities as Krampus,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.869
"uses other usernames
to perpetrate

35:21.913 --> 35:23.782
"acts of online stalking.

35:28.347 --> 35:30.826
harassment or slander."

35:30.869 --> 35:32.434
Revenge porn.

35:32.478 --> 35:34.478
For hire.KHAN:
Don't listen.

35:34.521 --> 35:36.086
This is
a made-up file.

35:36.130 --> 35:38.000
That's a photo
of some guy from HR.

35:38.043 --> 35:39.956
This is just a ruse
to guilt-trip you.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.782
This man also has
a history of hacking

35:42.826 --> 35:45.782
the cell phones
of random high school girls

35:45.826 --> 35:49.304
and holding embarrassing
pictures for ransom

35:49.347 --> 35:51.043
or posting them online.

35:51.086 --> 35:52.521
Most of these victims
are underage.

35:52.565 --> 35:54.782
Did this guy have a mother?
This keeps going.

35:54.826 --> 35:56.043
That's enough for now.

35:56.086 --> 35:59.043
This wasn't political
or someone seeking truth.

35:59.086 --> 36:01.869
For once, the avatar
matches the man.

36:01.913 --> 36:04.217
You're protecting a monster.

36:05.304 --> 36:07.043
So what?
I thought you got him.

36:07.086 --> 36:08.695
So what?

36:08.739 --> 36:10.869
That's all you have to say?
How can someone

36:10.913 --> 36:14.173
be so callous and cynical?
At Christmas?

36:14.217 --> 36:16.130
You're a criminal,
too, Bob Cratchit.

36:16.173 --> 36:18.217
Except I would give
anything to make up for it.

36:18.260 --> 36:21.086
You two are just hopeless,
heartless humbugs.

36:24.913 --> 36:26.434
Heidi, listen to me.

36:26.478 --> 36:29.565
You made bad choices

36:29.608 --> 36:30.869
and you were caught.

36:30.913 --> 36:33.434
You're a criminal.

36:33.478 --> 36:35.043
But not doing
the right thing because

36:35.086 --> 36:37.043
you have nothing
to lose or gain?

36:38.782 --> 36:41.043
That just makes you
a bad person.

36:41.086 --> 36:44.478
But that's
not you, is it?

36:44.521 --> 36:47.130
Kevin's wrong.

36:47.173 --> 36:49.956
I was wrong.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.869
It's okay to admit.

36:53.347 --> 36:55.739
Rule number 51.

36:55.782 --> 36:58.782
Sometimes you're wrong, Heidi.

36:58.826 --> 37:01.000
[laughs, voice breaks]

37:01.043 --> 37:03.782
Believe it or not,
before all of this,

37:03.826 --> 37:06.695
I was a good teacher.

37:06.739 --> 37:08.739
[cries]

37:08.782 --> 37:11.000
I taught my students
right and wrong.

37:13.347 --> 37:15.826
To clean up their messes.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.521
Krampus isn't in Wisconsin.

37:21.565 --> 37:24.608
But you know
where he is, don't you?

37:24.652 --> 37:26.652
Mm-hmm.

37:30.086 --> 37:32.086
Left a mess
I have to clean up now.

37:34.869 --> 37:36.652
McGEE:
That happens to be
rule number 45.

37:36.695 --> 37:39.217
And what I slowly realized

37:39.260 --> 37:41.956
Gibbs's rules are all about.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.695
What they're meant to prevent.

37:43.739 --> 37:47.434
Messes. Problems.
Screw-ups. Mistakes.

37:49.086 --> 37:51.608
But when messes
and problems happen,

37:51.652 --> 37:53.739
the rules are also there
to protect us.

37:53.782 --> 37:55.956
And because each of us
live by those rules,

37:56.000 --> 37:57.956
we know that no matter
how many we break,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.043
no matter how much we screw up,

38:00.086 --> 38:02.043
there will be someone
to save us.

38:20.869 --> 38:22.782
[helicopter flying over]

38:36.565 --> 38:39.869
Which is what Christmas
is about, too.

38:39.913 --> 38:42.608
Someone giving us
a second chance.

38:42.652 --> 38:45.304
Like a parent.

38:45.347 --> 38:46.695
A father.

38:46.739 --> 38:49.304
FBI agents raided
the Jacksonville

38:49.347 --> 38:50.521
retirement community

38:50.565 --> 38:51.739
where known hacker

38:51.782 --> 38:53.347
Douglas VonDorothy lived

38:53.391 --> 38:54.391
with his elderly parents,

38:54.434 --> 38:56.043
under false names.

38:56.086 --> 38:58.695
VonDorothy was arrested
and taken into custody.

38:58.739 --> 39:00.043
I told you
I'd get into MTAC.

39:00.086 --> 39:01.695
There he is.Our Cyber
and Special Operations

39:01.739 --> 39:04.130
Division have recovered
hard drives

39:04.173 --> 39:06.869
thought to contain vital
security intel stolen

39:06.913 --> 39:10.608
from Washington, DC, Internet
servers late last night.

39:10.652 --> 39:12.652
[soft whistle]

39:12.695 --> 39:14.434
[whispers]:
Nice, Tim.

39:15.782 --> 39:17.869
McGEE:
The case helped me
recognize all the hard,

39:17.913 --> 39:20.826
thankless work
you put in over the years.

39:20.869 --> 39:24.260
That while I've learned
a lot from Gibbs,

39:24.304 --> 39:27.086
it's only possible
because of how I was raised.

39:27.130 --> 39:28.782
By you.

39:28.826 --> 39:31.521
You may not have numbered
your rules, Dad, but...

39:31.565 --> 39:33.826
they were meant to teach
the same lessons.

39:33.869 --> 39:37.260
You taught me to always
be prepared.

39:37.304 --> 39:38.956
Always stand up for yourself.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.043
Then go. I'm staying.

39:41.086 --> 39:44.695
But if you're wrong, admit it.

39:44.739 --> 39:47.043
I'm still leaving out
a few, but...

39:47.086 --> 39:49.434
maybe hitting them all
was too lofty a goal.

39:49.478 --> 39:50.782
Dad, how can you say that?

39:50.826 --> 39:53.043
It's not about you, sometimes.

39:53.086 --> 39:55.739
Oh, I'm stubborn? Gee, I wonder
who I get that from?

39:57.434 --> 39:58.478
[sighs]

39:58.521 --> 40:00.565
No, we have the whole week off.

40:00.608 --> 40:02.130
There are other
agents here, Dad.

40:02.173 --> 40:04.086
Look, I have to go.

40:04.130 --> 40:06.130
I'll... I'll see you in an hour.

40:10.043 --> 40:12.043
Notice anything
different, McGeek?

40:13.521 --> 40:15.913
We installed the new
computer monitors.

40:15.956 --> 40:17.260
You touched my desk?

40:17.304 --> 40:19.304
It was their idea.We wanted
to thank you.

40:19.347 --> 40:21.521
What? No, we...
Don't say that out loud.Speak for yourself.

40:21.565 --> 40:24.000
No, no, no. This monitor should
be more to the left and...

40:24.043 --> 40:25.217
Okay, let's go to the van.

40:25.260 --> 40:26.782
Nobody needs to see
this part of Tim McGee.

40:26.826 --> 40:27.956
Come on, I.T. Kevin.Come on!

40:28.000 --> 40:30.782
You didn't even bundle
all the cables? Oof.

40:30.826 --> 40:33.043
What are you still
doing here, McGee?

40:34.304 --> 40:36.434
Your dad made time for you.

40:36.478 --> 40:38.652
Return the favor.

40:38.695 --> 40:41.478
McGEE:
Postponing that surgery was
you doing everything you could

40:41.521 --> 40:43.652
to make sure we had this
last holiday week together.

40:43.695 --> 40:47.565
Not in the hospital room,
but as a family.

40:47.608 --> 40:49.521
All of us.

40:49.565 --> 40:51.434
Why you couldn't have just
said that is beyond me.

40:51.478 --> 40:54.652
But I guess I'm the one
who has to write a letter.

41:00.565 --> 41:03.695
Communication was never
our strong suit, Dad.

41:04.565 --> 41:07.565
And we haven't always
seen eye-to-eye.

41:09.260 --> 41:11.826
But your rules,

41:11.869 --> 41:14.782
my breaking of them,

41:14.826 --> 41:17.826
our ensuing arguments,

41:17.869 --> 41:19.956
the resulting punishments...

41:20.000 --> 41:21.652
[knocking, door opens]

41:22.826 --> 41:24.652
Uh, people will
be arriving, Tim.

41:25.782 --> 41:27.434
Uh, just another minute, please?

41:27.478 --> 41:30.478
Sure.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.434
Every moment with you...

41:52.478 --> 41:55.478
from growing up
to these last few days--

41:57.608 --> 41:59.608
it meant something to me.

42:02.608 --> 42:04.130
I've heard it takes a man

42:04.173 --> 42:07.347
to make a man.

42:07.391 --> 42:09.391
Well, you've helped make me one.

42:21.913 --> 42:23.913
Before I say good-bye, Dad...

42:29.434 --> 42:31.434
I just want to say thank you.

42:33.434 --> 42:35.434
For everything.

42:45.130 --> 42:47.130
[voice breaking]:
Merry Christmas, Dad.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.434
I love you.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
