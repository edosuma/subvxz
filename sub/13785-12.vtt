01:40.893 --> 01:42.894
(pounds on door)

01:46.857 --> 01:49.317
(pounding continues)

01:49.485 --> 01:51.736
Quit your goddamn knockin'.
I'm comin'.

01:53.489 --> 01:55.531
(pounding continues)

02:00.996 --> 02:03.456
Casket's come with your name on it.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.334
Why tell me in the middle
of the night?

02:06.502 --> 02:09.294
- Body's inside.
- Evidently not mine.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.172
But I'd as soon make delivery.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.758
You'll find out where
when I decide. Good night.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.804
I don't like your tone of voice.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.390
Who are you, Mr. Utter, for me
to care what you like or don't?

02:21.558 --> 02:24.560
I'm the guy
that the next time you see me,

02:24.728 --> 02:27.313
you'd better take
a different fuckin' tone with.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.981
(chuckles)

02:29.149 --> 02:31.651
Given what's in store,
I'm not sure I'll ever learn

02:31.819 --> 02:34.278
what price I'd have paid
for not complyin'.

02:34.446 --> 02:36.697
Oh, I guess someone lookin' hard

02:36.865 --> 02:39.534
might could find you in there
somewheres,

02:39.701 --> 02:43.579
peekin' from under the covers
to make a fuckin' threat.

03:01.390 --> 03:04.267
Their quality apart,
Claudia, failing reception,

03:04.434 --> 03:06.686
our efforts are lost to the void.

03:06.854 --> 03:10.439
- I understand.
- Don't say so! Please!

03:11.608 --> 03:13.609
I lose my thought.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.907
This camp is in mortal danger.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.827
The man Hearst
is a murderous engine.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.162
My friend Swearengen,

03:25.330 --> 03:28.332
aware their combat is unequal,

03:28.500 --> 03:30.626
feels the appeal of the gory finish.

03:30.794 --> 03:35.131
Others I've just come to know
stand candidates in the elections,

03:35.299 --> 03:38.092
whose results they know may be moot.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.304
What, one is disposed to ask,

03:41.471 --> 03:44.432
in fuck ought a theater man to do?

03:45.934 --> 03:49.395
Of a certainty our debut's
postponement is necessary.

03:49.563 --> 03:53.149
But unless of one's own volition,
certain is it too

03:53.317 --> 03:55.776
that one would not be canceled.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.945
To prevent that, if need be,

03:58.113 --> 04:00.990
even off the boards
one would take steps

04:01.158 --> 04:03.492
of one's fuckin' own!

04:12.336 --> 04:15.129
Why did you bring me here?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.968
I don't know, child.

04:24.139 --> 04:29.310
What's the point Al having us leave IOUs
when Wu can't read fuckin' English?

04:29.478 --> 04:32.396
Wu gets back, he'll take Al
the IOUs for interpretin',

04:32.564 --> 04:35.149
find out Al did the rightful thing
while he was gone.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.026
It's a big point with Al, ain't it?

04:37.194 --> 04:40.571
When he ain't lyin', Al's the most
honorable man you'll ever meet.

04:43.992 --> 04:47.745
Adams: Johnny, balance up against
this fuckin' Chinese sign

04:47.913 --> 04:49.997
- while I lay my rack on your shoulder.
- Why?

04:50.165 --> 04:52.500
Just shut the fuck up.
Get this meat inside.

04:52.668 --> 04:54.835
What are you gonna do?

04:58.340 --> 05:00.508
Murder.

05:06.014 --> 05:09.976
Where the fuck you been?
I fuckin' vouched for you!

05:10.143 --> 05:13.229
We're camped up
at Spearfish Meadows,

05:13.397 --> 05:17.274
as not to tip Hearst off
till Swearengen can deploy us.

05:17.442 --> 05:21.404
I mean, I rode into town to tell you,
but I fell one saloon short.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.406
Come on.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.367
Lots of Chinks in that
meadows up there.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.661
Is the railroad comin' to camp?

05:31.039 --> 05:33.749
To have kept our claim,

05:33.917 --> 05:37.336
we'd have had to leave here, you and I,

05:37.504 --> 05:41.424
so that thugs we'd have had to engage
could counter Mr. Hearst's thugs

05:41.591 --> 05:46.178
without having the further
responsibility of defending us.

05:46.346 --> 05:50.266
So we are to sell, Sofia,

05:50.434 --> 05:52.393
so that we may stay.

05:52.561 --> 05:56.272
To be fair to Mr. Hearst,
which is more than he deserves,

05:56.440 --> 05:59.400
the price he is paying assigns
a great worth to our holdings,

05:59.568 --> 06:02.111
which lacking expertise of our own,

06:02.279 --> 06:06.240
and others now being absent
who might have provided it,

06:06.408 --> 06:10.995
as a practical matter
makes refusal absurd.

06:12.914 --> 06:16.125
But how I hate to give
that man what he wants.

06:19.296 --> 06:23.382
Your hair has survived my diatribe.

06:23.550 --> 06:28.054
If we left, we wouldn't be able
to see Mr. Ellsworth.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.934
And we are not leaving.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.973
Adams: Your fuckin' throat's
gonna be at risk, Hawkeye, in case

07:13.141 --> 07:16.977
you don't fuckin' realize, which wouldn't
bother me except mine's gonna be too.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.608
Hearst:
Advancing your interests,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.902
Mrs. Ellsworth,

07:25.070 --> 07:29.115
mine and all others,

07:29.282 --> 07:31.492
what we do here seems

07:31.660 --> 07:33.744
natural and proper.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.747
Mr. Newman, I ask you

07:36.915 --> 07:39.041
to ready payment

07:39.209 --> 07:42.002
to the officers
of Mrs. Ellsworth's bank.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.922
We'll receive it where
we can put it in her safe.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.966
Hearst:
May I hope, madam,

07:47.134 --> 07:50.678
you do not subscribe
to this insulting

07:50.846 --> 07:53.222
and juvenile precaution?

07:53.390 --> 07:55.391
I do not find the precaution juvenile,

07:55.559 --> 07:59.436
so many having been murdered with whom
you've had dealings in this camp.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.148
At least you acknowledge the insult.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.900
I acknowledge the pretense to civility

08:05.068 --> 08:06.944
in a man so brutally vicious

08:07.112 --> 08:10.072
as vapid and grotesque.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.957
Have the gold seen
to her bank, Newman.

08:20.125 --> 08:24.837
Have its purity assayed.
Let her or her seconds choose the man.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.257
When that tedium is completed,
have the documents witnessed

08:28.425 --> 08:31.594
as though we were all of us Jews.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.597
And bring the business back to me.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.640
Excuse my absence, Mr. Star,

08:37.808 --> 08:40.352
as I hope you'll forgive

08:40.520 --> 08:43.563
my thoughtless aspersion on your race.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.525
You stand for local office,

08:46.693 --> 08:49.695
but some contests being countywide,

08:49.863 --> 08:52.281
I await wires from the other camps.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.662
You've changed your scent.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.539
Can't shut up!

09:00.707 --> 09:02.917
Every bully I ever met

09:03.084 --> 09:05.669
can't shut his fuckin' mouth...

09:08.173 --> 09:10.591
except when he's afraid.

09:14.346 --> 09:17.890
You mistake for fear, Mr. Bullock,

09:18.058 --> 09:21.477
what is in fact a preoccupation.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.941
I'm having a conversation
you cannot hear.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.084
(knocks)

09:45.252 --> 09:48.128
See, that's just Miss Stubbs now
answering my message I sent her

09:48.296 --> 09:51.423
by secret thinking,
requesting unguent for my bruises.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.927
Hello hello, Miss Stubbs.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.971
Hello hello, yourself.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.807
- Hello, Sofia.
- Hello, Miss Stubbs.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.934
I'm just going to the center.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.979
- I wondered if you needed anything.
- Oh, I've let her in on it.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.693
You needn't tell a stretcher
how it is you come to appear.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.821
- You told?
- Asked for unguent by secret thinking

10:13.989 --> 10:17.700
- for the beating she was giving my hands.
- That's my purpose in the center.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.536
Stopped to ask
if you needed aught else.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.705
If I did, I believe

10:22.872 --> 10:24.832
you'd already know.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.627
Hit her a good one for me.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.838
Sofia: I will.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.846
- (knock on door)
- Hearst: Come in!

10:41.558 --> 10:43.642
I was looking for Mr. Hearst.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.477
Who do you think you're talkin' to?

10:45.645 --> 10:49.565
Candidly, of late
I'm at pains to be certain

10:49.733 --> 10:52.484
which voices are within me
and which without.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.362
This one is without,
telling you to come in.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.072
Of course.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.163
What is it, Mr. Hearst?

11:04.331 --> 11:07.875
I've sensed for some while
we owed each other a talk.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.044
Let the outcome be grim or worse,

11:10.211 --> 11:13.297
I'll at least be relieved that it's past.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.811
May I look at the addressee?

11:27.979 --> 11:32.149
How will you know to whom
it is be delivered if you do not?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.319
Oh dear.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.199
Well, I'll be on my way then.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.506
Must have shook 100 hands in Sturgis.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.925
When you declared for sheriff, Harry,

11:58.093 --> 11:59.885
I feared you'd be a poor campaigner

12:00.053 --> 12:02.262
and derelict in your duties here.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.473
You've held your end up and more.

12:04.641 --> 12:08.018
Ache in my hand and wrist,
the deep-set dirt defies me.

12:08.186 --> 12:11.730
If sweeping, you don't
raise your usual simoon,

12:11.898 --> 12:14.149
it's a paltry price to pay.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.276
Fuck if you saw that comin'.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.821
I have something to show you, Harry.

12:29.124 --> 12:30.958
The Finster Model 60

12:31.126 --> 12:33.210
steam pumper fire wagon.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.712
Harry:
120-gallon boiler?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.798
Three brass nozzles.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.967
Nickel-finished firebox?

12:40.135 --> 12:42.302
I believe that to be the case.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.350
Did the hats come?

12:50.770 --> 12:53.397
Is that a checker in Steve's mouth?

12:53.565 --> 12:57.359
You don't want to look
after him, just say so.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.361
Who says I don't?

12:59.529 --> 13:02.281
Only he kibitzes my moves.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.867
- Where are you goin'?
- Takin' him to vote for Bullock.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.578
This may require my supervision.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.747
I'll vote just before lunch.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.000
I'll go once you've relieved me.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.841
You don't expect me to believe
you didn't steam this open

13:21.009 --> 13:23.051
and reseal it for me to open again?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.887
I didn't wanna know.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.270
This motherfucker!

13:33.438 --> 13:36.148
For my complicity in his shooting,
he orders my death.

13:36.316 --> 13:40.068
- You did read it.
- (gasps)

13:40.236 --> 13:41.904
Be quick then, please.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.490
Your complicity's mostly
in your noggin', EB.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.617
It's the whore he wants dead.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.746
By what vile method then?

13:50.914 --> 13:54.917
Is Trixie to be drawn and quartered
and set aflame?

13:55.084 --> 13:58.462
- Say he'll have my answer in an hour.
- Al.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.214
- EB.
- I can't, Al.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.674
I can't engage him
in further conversation.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.677
When I hear his voice,
I see the inside of his skull!

14:05.845 --> 14:09.932
Phantoms grin out at me,
oozing gruesome goo.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.434
Slide this under his door then.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.770
Would you rather I tell him?

14:14.938 --> 14:16.939
Only decide quickly.

14:21.736 --> 14:24.780
Fear is every man's portion.

14:41.965 --> 14:45.050
- Did he send for you, Joanie?
- What's happenin' here, Con?

14:45.218 --> 14:47.719
Well, not knowin' Mr. Tolliver's

14:47.887 --> 14:50.806
present state of feelin'
towards you is why I ask.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.183
Then why don't you stay
the fuck out of it, Con?

14:54.352 --> 14:58.105
I wasn't fuckin' dreamin'.
It is Joanie Stubbs.

14:58.273 --> 15:01.525
I got "Stay the fuck out" written
on a stone tablet in my bedroom.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.906
- How are you feeling, Cy?
- I get around all right.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.951
- Your color's better.
- Is that a fucking fact?

15:11.119 --> 15:14.413
My color's better, Stupid.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.374
Stupid, this is Joanie Stubbs.

15:17.542 --> 15:20.502
- Hi.
- What's your name, honey?

15:21.963 --> 15:24.047
Go ahead and tell her your name.

15:24.215 --> 15:26.466
- Janine.
- Hi, Janine.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.469
- Hi.
- Go ahead now, Jan-nine-nine-ine,

15:29.637 --> 15:32.723
and finish your Latin lessons
and your Greek.

15:32.890 --> 15:37.352
The thirst this girl has for knowledge,
she's barely time to suck a prick.

15:42.025 --> 15:45.235
- She's pretty.
- What the fuck do you want?

15:48.239 --> 15:50.073
I've been thinking about you is all.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.867
(scoffs)

15:52.035 --> 15:55.162
Help me understand cunt, Lord.

15:55.330 --> 15:59.166
Saying the other night you oughtn't
come inside that school, Cy,

15:59.334 --> 16:01.126
don't feel I don't wish you well.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.171
Buy some lines in the paper, Joanie,
let the public know.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.590
I know you meant that
for me in your way.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.259
- What?
- Meant me well.

16:09.427 --> 16:13.513
If it's Christmas, where's the fucking snow
or the fucking harp music or the like?

16:14.682 --> 16:18.018
If it wasn't for you,
I'd have died a long long time ago.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.481
Some happiness has come
into my life now--

16:22.649 --> 16:25.067
I'm grateful I didn't.

16:26.319 --> 16:30.364
My lines are women, liquor
and rigged games of chance.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.950
Are you playing?

16:34.118 --> 16:37.329
What do you think of
all this trouble Hearst brought?

16:37.497 --> 16:41.375
Or does a girl have to drive cattle
for you to eat her pussy?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.719
Are you voting, Leon?

16:52.887 --> 16:55.138
Against the opium ordinance.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.057
(sniffs)

17:05.566 --> 17:07.776
What the fuck are you looking at?

17:10.821 --> 17:13.949
That whore's gotta die.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.034
Jen?

17:16.202 --> 17:18.829
Hearst won't stand
for an empty coffin.

17:18.996 --> 17:22.874
Likely he paid most attention
to Trixie's tits and snatch,

17:23.041 --> 17:25.460
so Jen'll adequately pass.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.424
- Jesus Christ.
- I know.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.176
- You like her.
- She's a nice girl.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.011
All right.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.472
She's learning to read.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.267
Spend some time with her

17:40.435 --> 17:42.394
and let me know when you're done.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.189
You'll scare her.

17:46.357 --> 17:50.152
I've done it once or twice, Johnny.
She won't know that's what I'm there for.

17:50.319 --> 17:53.864
She won't need to.
You scare her no matter what.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.618
(sobs)

17:59.954 --> 18:02.497
(slams table)
Oh, just give me a fucking knife then.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.291
Just give me the fucking knife.

18:14.927 --> 18:18.221
- Fucking Trixie!
- Don't get me started.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.822
- What are you doing?
- Going for a stroll to the polls.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.283
One vote for Star buys a handjob.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.285
- Repeaters get a suck.
- Trixie.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.205
I'm through staying inside.
If something's to happen,

18:43.372 --> 18:46.041
- let it happen to me.
- You selfish cunt!

18:46.209 --> 18:48.376
- No one asked you to put me up.
- That's right.

18:48.544 --> 18:52.088
That's right. My fucking choice!
I'm not fucking afraid.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.674
- I guess maybe I'm not either.
- Not to die.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.510
Well, ain't you clever?

18:56.677 --> 18:59.471
Ain't you fucking clever,
you deep-thinking fucking Jew?

18:59.639 --> 19:02.140
Why bother with your boots
if you're going to be on your knees?

19:02.308 --> 19:05.602
- Let go of me! Let me walk out myself!
- No. The fuck if I will!

19:05.770 --> 19:09.022
At least I can say I threw you out
if you'd rather die than live with me!

19:25.414 --> 19:27.415
(crying)

19:29.710 --> 19:31.503
(knock on door)

19:57.154 --> 19:59.239
(sobbing)

20:04.161 --> 20:06.997
Use just half till you see
how you stand it.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.540
It itches bad.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.585
I'm saying use just half
till you see.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.594
I wanna talk with you.

20:22.597 --> 20:25.390
No, I mean it, Jen. I wanna talk.

20:27.268 --> 20:30.186
Pure conversation.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.355
Nothing for you
to be alarmed about.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.697
Four and five deep to vote, boss.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.741
Eyes up or predominantly down

20:42.909 --> 20:45.243
when Hearst's goons glare upon 'em?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.789
- Uh, I want to go check again.
- Good.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.584
Good. Never opine
short of certainty.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.171
What is this, Jen?

20:57.924 --> 21:00.467
A wall?

21:00.635 --> 21:03.803
On the surface, yes, it is.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.474
But inside,

21:07.642 --> 21:10.310
many creatures go about their lives,

21:10.478 --> 21:12.520
such as ants.

21:15.024 --> 21:17.734
They got a whole operation going.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.738
They got soldier ants and worker ants

21:21.906 --> 21:24.407
and whore ants to fuck
the soldiers and the workers,

21:24.575 --> 21:27.786
right inside that wall, baby ants.

21:29.997 --> 21:33.291
Everyone's got a task
to hew to, Jen.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.294
You understand me?

21:38.172 --> 21:40.924
Jesus Christ's fucking sake.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.343
We'll talk about this later.

21:51.352 --> 21:53.144
(sighs)

21:53.312 --> 21:55.563
- I can't.
- Give it to me then.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.732
No.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.859
Give me the fucking knife.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.778
She ain't stole or been quarrelsome

22:01.946 --> 22:05.281
- or set the bedding afire.
- Get out of my fucking way, Johnny.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.701
It ain't fair to fucking kill her.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.161
Since when did that begin entering in?

22:11.872 --> 22:13.790
I won't let you pass, boss.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.710
- Johnny.
- I won't.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.754
I won't let you.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.176
You're willing to die in her stead?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.721
If I got to...

22:29.181 --> 22:32.726
preferring you'd
handle things different.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.071
Make sure the whore don't leave.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.866
Let Johnny cool down,
then knock him the fuck out.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.367
What's gonna happen?

22:49.535 --> 22:52.662
What's gonna happen is
I'm gonna go look and see if,

22:52.830 --> 22:55.498
perchance, I mightn't be the owner

22:55.666 --> 22:57.709
of another fucking knife.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.593
Richardson!

23:08.054 --> 23:09.971
- I can't remember.
- Come here.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.265
Give it to me.

23:13.601 --> 23:16.478
I don't suppose you're
gonna go vote stocking-footed.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.731
- I forgot.
- Ain't those them?

23:23.819 --> 23:26.029
You gonna vote for Mr. Bullock now.

23:26.197 --> 23:28.990
Even though he beat Mr. Farnum,

23:29.158 --> 23:31.326
'cause he took
you-know-who by his ear.

23:31.494 --> 23:34.788
Like some others ain't
brave enough to do.

23:34.955 --> 23:38.458
Anyways, Harry Manning
gives me splinters.

23:38.626 --> 23:40.585
How's he do that, child?

23:40.753 --> 23:42.837
Raising the windows after he's et.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.631
Richardson...

23:44.799 --> 23:47.008
Richardson,
you're right about that.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.886
South had that man's gas
to load in their cannons--

23:50.054 --> 23:52.263
shoot, wouldn't be
no free niggers nowhere.

23:52.431 --> 23:56.059
Noah hisself would have
throwed him out t' boat.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.186
(both laughing)

23:58.354 --> 24:00.438
Now that's for us talking now.

24:00.606 --> 24:04.359
Don't you be saying what I say to you
outside these rooms.

24:04.527 --> 24:07.612
First you back, you're gonna clean
your mess up, Richardson.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.531
- You hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.

24:09.698 --> 24:12.158
Okay. Go on.

24:12.326 --> 24:15.662
- You look fine.
- Thank you.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.333
Remember who gave it to you, boys.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.585
Vote Democratic.

24:22.753 --> 24:26.089
(imitating monkey)

24:26.257 --> 24:29.008
Look what broke out
their cage-- a monkey.

24:29.176 --> 24:32.053
Rutherford: Right to vote shall
not be abridged or denied...

24:33.347 --> 24:36.182
on account of race or color

24:36.350 --> 24:38.518
or condition of previous servitude.

24:38.686 --> 24:41.521
15th Amendment
to the US Constitution,

24:41.689 --> 24:45.859
ratified 1870, law of the land thereafter,
including territories.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.653
They got something about
niggers not waiting their turn?

24:48.821 --> 24:51.197
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Oh, you ain't aware of it.

24:51.365 --> 24:53.950
Then I guess you'll want
this white man voting first.

24:54.118 --> 24:57.203
- What's a few minutes more?
- The nigger was before him.

24:57.371 --> 24:59.330
- Richardson: Yes.
- No, he wasn't.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.625
- I guess you're blind and stupid.
- I believe I'll vote later.

25:02.793 --> 25:05.879
Fuck if you will.
Get your nigger ass back in line.

25:06.046 --> 25:09.048
You'd better be walking him
home afterwards. (chokes)

25:09.216 --> 25:12.010
You'd better see to that yourself,
'cause if he don't make it,

25:12.178 --> 25:15.638
you'll be eating your spuds running
till I hunt you the fuck down.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.140
And that ends that.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.767
Charlie:
What your shit-stirring started.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.771
Will you drop your fucking ballot?

25:26.192 --> 25:28.234
Ain't it wonderful, Steve?

25:28.402 --> 25:30.737
Sorry for all the commotion, Miss Stubbs.

25:30.905 --> 25:32.363
That's all right, Mr. Utter.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.241
I got something at the jail

25:35.409 --> 25:37.452
for you and the other one.

25:37.620 --> 25:39.245
'Cept right now

25:39.413 --> 25:42.373
- I'm pretty agitated.
- Well, I got time.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.543
Maybe you'll calm down as we walk?

25:45.711 --> 25:48.087
All right.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.847
How do you make your way, Star,
not sometimes buying silence

25:58.015 --> 26:01.392
- by punching her in the fucking mouth?
- She thinks Hearst will want her dead.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.605
- She thinks you'll kill one of these others.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.858
- Jesus Christ.
- Is it true?

26:09.026 --> 26:10.818
I already fucking did.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.988
- Is that true?
- Don't waste your Jew's time

26:14.156 --> 26:17.408
wondering what's true and what ain't.
You go over there, tell fucking Hearst

26:17.576 --> 26:20.328
the whore Trixie has been killed,
and then tell Joan of Arc

26:20.496 --> 26:23.081
that instead of flames lapping
at her tippy-toes,

26:23.249 --> 26:27.126
you'd have her live to fuck in the morning.
And after you tell fucking Hearst,

26:27.294 --> 26:31.047
before you tell that loudmouth cunt,
tell your fucking partner I need him here.

26:31.215 --> 26:35.510
- Don't talk about her that way.
- I fucking recant. Off you fucking go.

26:35.678 --> 26:38.805
And don't neglect fucking Bullock.
Water comes to a boil.

26:39.807 --> 26:42.141
All right.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.269
Unlucky fucking mutt.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.815
- You remember Hawkeye.
- How many has he got?

26:48.983 --> 26:51.693
Ride from Cheyenne winnowed
the wheat from the chaff.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.695
How many, Adams,
of the promised 23?

26:53.862 --> 26:55.697
Almost 18, Mr. Swearengen,

26:55.864 --> 26:58.825
camped in Spearfish Meadows,
ready to join in the issue.

26:58.993 --> 27:01.327
What does he mean by "almost 18"?

27:01.495 --> 27:04.330
17 normal size and a short one
that's hell with a knife.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.542
Turn me loose.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.836
Ain't that Mr. Wu?

27:10.004 --> 27:12.005
In there, Wu.

27:12.172 --> 27:14.882
Go with him to get the men,
station in Cochran's Alley.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.677
Send word you're positioned
with the midget.

27:17.845 --> 27:20.013
That went off well.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.901
- Hello hello.
- What happened, Jane?

27:34.069 --> 27:36.070
Nothing out of the ordinary.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.116
The bank lady took her child

27:40.284 --> 27:43.369
to Ellsworth's grave and I got drunk.

27:43.537 --> 27:46.956
- How long you been here?
- Many years.

27:47.124 --> 27:49.417
Or is it a day or two?
What's important is you get

27:49.585 --> 27:52.211
to keep asking me questions
so I don't get to ask you one.

27:52.379 --> 27:54.005
Go ahead.

27:54.173 --> 27:58.009
Why in fuck, with me asking you in
to play hot hands with me and Sofia,

27:58.177 --> 28:01.095
you stood there instead
looking like you just did murder?

28:01.263 --> 28:05.016
- You didn't. I'd come in if you'd asked.
- Bullshit!

28:05.184 --> 28:07.602
How can you say we've been sending
secret thought messages

28:07.770 --> 28:10.104
and pretend you didn't know?

28:10.272 --> 28:13.316
- Well, anyways.
- Anyways, what?

28:13.484 --> 28:16.819
Anyways, I've just finished
my business at the center.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.905
Who gives a fuck?

28:19.073 --> 28:21.115
I saw you, and then I went
to the Bella Union

28:21.283 --> 28:24.369
and I talked to Cy real quick,
and then I went and saw the voting--

28:24.536 --> 28:26.913
Is that so? Oh, so did you
go see Cy real quick?

28:27.081 --> 28:28.998
Did you pay a quick call on Cy?

28:29.166 --> 28:31.459
Did they stick some quick pricks in you?

28:31.627 --> 28:34.962
- It wasn't like that, Jane.
- Who gives a fuck? Not me.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.050
I saw at the voting

28:39.218 --> 28:42.428
what I guess you knowed
about Mr. Utter all these years

28:42.596 --> 28:46.265
and Mr. Hickok must have knowed.

28:46.433 --> 28:49.560
What he's like in a tight--
one he didn't even need to be in.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.897
Yeah, he's okay in those.

28:53.065 --> 28:56.109
I want to be that to you,

28:56.276 --> 28:58.569
even when we don't get along.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.698
We got that part down perfect,
me and him.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.784
What, the "don't get along"?

29:04.952 --> 29:07.662
Of course we had years of practice.

29:14.628 --> 29:17.338
He sent us this.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.800
That's Bill Hickok's robe you got there,

29:20.968 --> 29:23.386
that's whose that is.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.271
Warm.

29:33.439 --> 29:37.859
Hearst: I, in no way,
wish to impugn his veracity,

29:38.026 --> 29:41.112
but I would have
Mr. Swearengen understand that

29:41.280 --> 29:43.739
for her try on my life,

29:43.907 --> 29:47.285
I ought to see that the whore
has paid with her own.

29:47.453 --> 29:51.205
- All right.
- Wherever the viewing will impose least.

29:51.373 --> 29:54.917
- You'll go there?
- Of course. I feel very safe in this camp.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.922
Al: This fucking place is
gonna be a fucking misery.

30:00.090 --> 30:03.134
Every fucking one of them,
every fucking time I walk by,

30:03.302 --> 30:06.888
"Ooh, how could you? How could you?"
with their big fucking cow eyes.

30:07.055 --> 30:10.141
The entire fucking gaggle of 'em
is gonna have to bleed and quit

30:10.309 --> 30:13.895
before we can even hope for peace.
And what's the fucking alternative?

30:14.062 --> 30:17.273
I ain't fucking killing her
that sat nights with me sick

30:17.441 --> 30:20.735
and taking slaps to her mug
that were some less than fucking fair.

30:20.903 --> 30:25.323
I should have fucking learned to use a gun,
but I'm too fucking entrenched in my ways.

30:25.491 --> 30:28.534
And you ain't exactly the one
to be leveling criticisms

30:28.702 --> 30:32.079
on the score of being slow to adapt.
You fucking people

30:32.247 --> 30:34.999
are the original slow fucking learners!

30:48.889 --> 30:51.349
- Mmm.
- How was she, pal?

30:51.517 --> 30:54.602
Good. Wonderful.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.979
I don't mind a small pair of tits.

30:57.147 --> 30:59.815
(chuckles)
You sure you're done?

30:59.983 --> 31:03.361
You look the sort could turn right around
and drop the hammer again.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.488
I will if it's free.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.449
See you later, pal.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.623
C'mere.

31:38.313 --> 31:41.232
Did it seem like Hearst ordered
the interference?

31:41.400 --> 31:46.279
Huh-uh. Being stupid on his own
that strong-arm was.

31:46.446 --> 31:49.156
(chuckles)
Or if you want, I could say "yes."

31:49.324 --> 31:51.158
Tea, Mr. Utter?

31:51.326 --> 31:54.161
Tea got kick to it too,
a little, don't it?

31:54.329 --> 31:56.330
Would you rather coffee?

31:56.498 --> 31:59.750
Oh, no no no.
I ought to get familiar with tea.

32:05.716 --> 32:08.009
Much free liquor as them Pinkertons

32:08.176 --> 32:10.136
poured against you, Sheriff,

32:10.304 --> 32:13.723
it seemed like strong support
for you and Star.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.392
My election's countywide, Charlie.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.769
That's what's fucking worrisome,

32:18.937 --> 32:20.855
fucking countywide aspect.

32:21.023 --> 32:23.232
(knocks, slams)

32:23.400 --> 32:26.694
- Mr. Star.
- I'm sorry for barging in.

32:26.862 --> 32:28.904
What is it, Sol?

32:30.449 --> 32:31.949
Everything.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.286
Hearst:
Mr. Langrishe.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.080
Making bold to ask
after your health, sir.

32:38.248 --> 32:41.250
- I was shot in the shoulder.
- So one understood.

32:41.418 --> 32:44.086
But the wound seems healing clean.

32:44.254 --> 32:46.088
- And your back, sir?
- Oh, deprived

32:46.256 --> 32:50.259
of your Turkish artillery treatments,
my back is as it was.

32:50.427 --> 32:52.261
Please blame my dereliction

32:52.429 --> 32:54.513
on the demands
of readying our theater.

32:54.681 --> 32:57.767
I had been blaming your choosing

32:57.934 --> 33:00.645
old friends over new acquaintances.
Please, sit down.

33:00.812 --> 33:04.231
One prays always, sir,
as one's store is depleted

33:04.399 --> 33:07.902
by time, new acquaintances
may become one's friends.

33:08.070 --> 33:11.113
As your friend, I ask you
to believe that fate

33:11.281 --> 33:14.659
has not chosen for your encounter
with your deepest destiny

33:14.826 --> 33:17.536
the place where you now find yourself,

33:17.704 --> 33:19.622
while decreeing for some,

33:19.790 --> 33:22.792
my friend Swearengen included,
quite otherwise.

33:22.959 --> 33:26.212
Your proposition is that this place
at this hour will show

33:26.380 --> 33:28.923
- all of Mr. Swearengen?
- Yes.

33:29.091 --> 33:33.386
- And Mr. Bullock, who took me by the ear?
- I only hazard my impression that,

33:33.553 --> 33:36.430
less possessing his character
than possessed by it,

33:36.598 --> 33:40.309
he is also someone for whom
the outcome must be soon.

33:40.477 --> 33:44.230
Whilst imagining for you, Mr. Hearst,

33:44.398 --> 33:47.817
the Earth entertaining

33:47.984 --> 33:51.487
some larger purpose
to be told you elsewhere

33:51.655 --> 33:53.656
and at another time.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.121
Why do you say so?

34:00.288 --> 34:01.747
In those words, I mean--

34:01.915 --> 34:03.708
"The Earth speaks"?

34:03.875 --> 34:06.752
A vestige of childhood tales

34:06.920 --> 34:09.170
in which not only humans spoke,

34:09.339 --> 34:13.134
but other creatures too--
mountains and streams.

34:13.301 --> 34:16.887
I imagine she speaks to me still,

34:17.054 --> 34:20.891
the Earth and what's inside her,
how to get it out.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.601
Comprehending such a language

34:23.770 --> 34:25.646
can cost a man

34:25.813 --> 34:27.648
his own kind's sympathies.

34:27.815 --> 34:30.150
Arguing perhaps for a more

34:30.318 --> 34:32.402
solitary life.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.405
Sad anointing.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.366
The mountain I must go up on,

34:37.534 --> 34:40.786
Mr. Langrishe, I have ascended before.

34:40.954 --> 34:43.998
It's in Montana and I came
down it with silver,

34:44.166 --> 34:47.501
suspecting there was copper too,
and now I'm told that's true.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.879
Do I understand you to say
you're leaving us?

34:50.045 --> 34:52.547
For the Anaconda, yes.

34:52.716 --> 34:55.634
But first, I'll have the election returns,

34:55.802 --> 35:00.222
and then one last visit with your friend
to see the cunt who shot me dead.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.099
Good day, sir.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.407
Box her in my office.

35:18.575 --> 35:21.452
Send Jewel up, clean up the mess?

35:21.620 --> 35:23.621
If I'm having her boxed
in my fucking office,

35:23.789 --> 35:26.499
don't I want the blood left
for the cocksucker to see?

35:26.666 --> 35:31.170
And when that's over if we're still alive,
I'll clean my own fucking mess up.

35:33.006 --> 35:35.674
Look in on Johnny,
see if he's grown the fuck up.

35:37.844 --> 35:40.638
Sturgis is a landslide for Harry Manning.

35:40.806 --> 35:44.558
Blazanov: 970 votes for Harry Manning,
68 votes for Mr. Bullock.

35:44.726 --> 35:47.269
Heavy turnout among
the bivouacked military.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.529
"Within the hour," Hearst said
20 minutes or so ago.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.405
Didn't you tell him?

35:58.573 --> 36:00.491
I have not as yet, no.

36:01.618 --> 36:04.703
How do you think you might
enjoy private life?

36:08.166 --> 36:10.084
Sturgis?

36:10.252 --> 36:12.002
970 votes for Harry Manning,

36:12.170 --> 36:14.463
68 votes for Mr. Bullock!

36:14.631 --> 36:16.757
(loud thump)

36:21.513 --> 36:23.681
(sighs)

36:38.238 --> 36:41.740
- Put her in?
- Don't I want to put my dress on her first,

36:41.908 --> 36:45.369
- you fucking moron?
- I'm sent to check on Johnny.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.747
I'll come back and put her in.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.043
(sobbing)

36:57.340 --> 37:00.718
She's putting Jen in her dress.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.888
Johnny.

37:04.055 --> 37:07.683
Then I'll do the boxing.

37:11.605 --> 37:15.858
We show united in the prelude when he's
making his entrance and the fucking like.

37:16.026 --> 37:19.194
Comes to viewing the body,
I stand for virtue alone.

37:19.362 --> 37:23.782
The deception failing,
I'll make a pass at him with my blade.

37:23.950 --> 37:26.410
In the aftermath

37:26.578 --> 37:28.454
play the lie as mine,

37:28.622 --> 37:31.290
knowing I speak of you in heaven.

37:34.294 --> 37:36.754
Others owe thought to the future

37:36.922 --> 37:40.132
that thinking straightforward
don't come that naturally to.

37:42.552 --> 37:44.637
Fuck you, Dan!

37:44.804 --> 37:47.640
- Fuck you!
- You got my condolences.

37:50.310 --> 37:54.396
As sorrowful as the passing of Jen is,
you know that Al, he didn't have no choice.

37:54.564 --> 37:57.483
- Bullshit.
- Feeling how he feels about Trixie

37:57.651 --> 38:00.903
is what I'm saying. Come on, Johnny,
you side with your feelings.

38:01.071 --> 38:04.281
Right or wrong,
you side with your feelings.

38:06.159 --> 38:09.119
Can you come to yourself
in time to be of some fucking use?

38:17.212 --> 38:20.381
Cy: You don't chew your cabbage
twice, do you, Mr. Newman?

38:20.548 --> 38:24.009
I guess I don't have to set
big blocks of time aside

38:24.177 --> 38:28.806
for this future collaboration
between us that Mr. Hearst outlines here.

38:28.974 --> 38:31.392
You don't want
to crack too fucking wise.

38:31.559 --> 38:34.228
I don't want to be talking
to you at all, Mr. Newman,

38:34.396 --> 38:37.606
but that seems to be
the way the hand lays.

38:37.774 --> 38:40.025
I tell him you agree?

38:40.193 --> 38:42.736
Yeah, you tell him I agree,

38:42.904 --> 38:46.740
and I appreciate the chance
at a new friendship.

38:52.080 --> 38:56.083
A few nails in the box, Dan,
would do me for pretext.

38:58.962 --> 39:01.088
(door opens)

39:27.490 --> 39:29.158
(hammers)

39:30.160 --> 39:32.202
Cy:
All but sucked your prick,

39:32.370 --> 39:34.997
you'd have me be
your fucking quartermaster.

39:35.165 --> 39:37.458
(men shouting in Chinese)

39:40.378 --> 39:44.089
The rising tide
of fucking Chinks, Janine...

39:45.300 --> 39:50.220
the ragtag collection by the hardware store
I'd put in Swearengen's camp.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.184
(giggles, sniffs)

39:55.351 --> 39:57.644
Good dope today, am I right, Leon?

40:01.566 --> 40:03.692
Last two or three days have been good.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.614
You are a fucking beauty, Leon.

40:08.782 --> 40:10.657
Lifts me up to be with you.

40:10.825 --> 40:12.785
- (knife thrusts)
- (Leon gasps)

40:12.952 --> 40:14.119
Jesus!

40:21.169 --> 40:23.003
What the fuck did you do to me, sir?

40:23.171 --> 40:25.047
Cy:
I believe I fucking stabbed you.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.312
Gentlemen.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.857
Any word yet on how
the other camps have voted?

40:44.025 --> 40:46.568
(clears throat)

40:48.446 --> 40:50.739
Is it as sheriff, Mr. Bullock,

40:50.907 --> 40:54.409
- you divide us?
- Need anyone divide us inside?

40:54.577 --> 40:56.870
Hearst: Are you sure
you still hold office?

40:57.038 --> 40:59.039
If I'm beat, it owes to Yankton's whore

40:59.207 --> 41:01.291
buying cavalry repeaters in Sturgis.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.585
Why, sir, then you must protest--

41:03.753 --> 41:07.381
camp in Yankton,
protest and demand justice;

41:07.549 --> 41:09.633
grab the legislators by their ears.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.136
Ain't you here to confirm a croaker?

41:12.303 --> 41:14.429
In here?

41:20.562 --> 41:23.647
Mr. Newman and so many of his cohorts

41:23.815 --> 41:26.358
as he deems appropriate will precede us.

41:26.526 --> 41:29.903
- You don't mind if I go in alone?
- Not at all, sir.

41:42.625 --> 41:45.210
Cy: If Hearst moves his
operating headquarters to Lead,

41:45.378 --> 41:47.796
I get to see to all

41:47.964 --> 41:51.091
his other-than-mining interests
here in the camp.

41:51.259 --> 41:53.260
Congratulations, sir.

41:53.428 --> 41:54.928
Thank you, Leon.

41:56.431 --> 41:58.473
If those are your last words here on Earth,

41:58.641 --> 42:02.060
- you tell the Lord you went out stupid.
- He's dead.

42:02.228 --> 42:03.770
No, not yet, honey.

42:03.938 --> 42:07.316
See how the blood still
pumps a little out his leg?

42:07.483 --> 42:10.569
When they're dead, that turns to seep.

42:13.698 --> 42:16.575
Do you believe I will
leave without seeing?

42:16.743 --> 42:19.953
Well, I was hesitant to presume.

42:29.422 --> 42:31.340
(guns uncock)

43:29.190 --> 43:31.316
(continues wiping feet)

43:44.122 --> 43:46.290
Charlie: What do you want
done with that body?

43:46.457 --> 43:48.750
It's Mr. Swearengen's affair now.

43:49.919 --> 43:52.129
The body at my fucking freight office,

43:52.297 --> 43:55.716
- what you want done with that one?
- You'll be wired instructions.

43:59.804 --> 44:02.347
Has she family ought be notified?

44:02.515 --> 44:05.058
I don't notify fucking family.

44:05.226 --> 44:07.519
I guess especially not hers.

44:17.071 --> 44:18.989
She has a sister,

44:19.157 --> 44:21.033
whores in Gunnison.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.577
Jen's sister, you could write to,

44:23.745 --> 44:26.204
care of the Yellowbird.

44:34.172 --> 44:36.548
I'd take that fucking scrub brush.

44:43.806 --> 44:47.517
AW: I wonder if, the other day,
you took my not publishing

44:47.685 --> 44:50.854
the news that you'd been shot
for a failure to observe,

44:51.022 --> 44:53.940
or lay it correctly
to a judgment on my part

44:54.108 --> 44:57.069
that suppressing the news
would better serve the camp.

44:57.236 --> 44:59.946
I've stopped reading your paper, Merrick.

45:00.114 --> 45:04.368
I'll have my people here start
another one-- to lie the other way.

45:04.535 --> 45:07.329
Hop down. I'd like to take
a last look around.

45:10.416 --> 45:13.835
Cy: If I'm quick enough
about this, Janine,

45:14.003 --> 45:17.672
maybe me and Mr. Hearst will get
to hear the Lord judge Leon.

45:33.773 --> 45:36.358
You want to get a listen too?

45:36.526 --> 45:38.527
Huh?

45:40.488 --> 45:42.239
No, Charlie.

45:44.951 --> 45:48.620
- Yes, Mr. Bullock?
- You looked at your last body.

45:48.788 --> 45:51.790
You're done tipping your fucking hat.
Get out of here...

45:51.958 --> 45:54.167
- Stop!
- ...or I'll drag you out by the ear.

46:00.550 --> 46:03.301
Oh, please. Please don't.

46:08.015 --> 46:10.225
Drive on.

46:10.393 --> 46:12.936
Hyah!

46:25.241 --> 46:28.827
Tell fuckin' Con to take
care of that asshole.

46:50.308 --> 46:53.059
- Charlie: You done fucking good.
- I did fucking nothing.

46:54.687 --> 46:57.189
That's often a tough one,

46:57.356 --> 47:00.734
in aid of the larger purpose.

47:00.902 --> 47:05.780
Which is laying head to pillow,
not confusing yourself with a sucker?

47:05.948 --> 47:09.284
- Far as I ever get.
- 'Cause that's gonna be a project tonight.

48:05.174 --> 48:07.092
Did she suffer?

48:07.260 --> 48:12.097
I was gentle as I was able, and that's
the last we'll fucking speak of it, Johnny.

48:17.520 --> 48:20.939
Wants me to tell him
something pretty.

48:35.037 --> 48:37.038
