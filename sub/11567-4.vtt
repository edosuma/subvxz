00:17.856 --> 00:19.258
Thanks for the late dinner.

00:19.290 --> 00:21.159
Ah, my kitchen's always open for you.

00:21.192 --> 00:23.194
And the gluten was extra tasty.

00:25.097 --> 00:27.132
- That wasn't pasta?
- It was pasta.

00:27.165 --> 00:28.566
Oh, good.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.767
It wasn't chicken.

00:32.136 --> 00:34.106
Well, the chicken that isn't chicken

00:34.138 --> 00:35.640
goes really well with the coffee
that isn't coffee.

00:37.676 --> 00:39.245
Mmm.

00:41.035 --> 00:44.422
So, I'm going to let Linda
move into my spare room.

00:44.682 --> 00:45.751
For Nick?

00:46.484 --> 00:48.786
Yeah, but not forever.

00:48.819 --> 00:50.188
You're a really good father.

00:51.423 --> 00:52.490
You play?

00:52.524 --> 00:53.591
A little.

00:54.526 --> 00:55.694
What's your game?

00:55.727 --> 00:57.029
- Texas Hold'em, what's yours?
- Mmm!

00:57.061 --> 01:00.731
Ah, if it wasn't for poker,
I would've starved at med school.

01:00.764 --> 01:03.267
You wanna go a few rounds?

01:03.301 --> 01:05.771
Absolutely.

01:05.804 --> 01:08.106
But I gotta warn you, I have
a really good poker face.

01:09.341 --> 01:10.454
Actually...

01:11.676 --> 01:13.779
You have a slight eye twitch
when you aren't being

01:13.811 --> 01:15.379
100 percent honest.

01:15.413 --> 01:16.514
I can prove it to you.

01:16.548 --> 01:17.615
- Oh, can you?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:17.649 --> 01:18.817
Just lie to me about something.

01:20.218 --> 01:21.262
Um...

01:21.786 --> 01:24.755
Oh. You know, I do like this
tea better than coffee.

01:24.789 --> 01:27.258
Twitch. You don't like my tea?

01:28.859 --> 01:30.796
Well, I like the company
that comes with the tea.

01:33.476 --> 01:34.579
- No twitch?
- No twitch.

01:35.153 --> 01:35.788
Hmm.

01:36.701 --> 01:37.736
Hmm.

01:59.823 --> 02:01.126
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:12.603 --> 02:15.166
You didn't have to drive
my mom back to Grey House.

02:15.199 --> 02:16.405
I wanted to.

02:17.374 --> 02:19.144
Sounds like you two really hit it off?

02:19.977 --> 02:20.765
Yeah.

02:21.146 --> 02:23.469
Guess the real question's
why you thought we wouldn't.

02:23.801 --> 02:26.104
Are you embarrassed of me?

02:27.319 --> 02:28.820
Look...

02:28.852 --> 02:30.488
You don't know my mother.

02:30.522 --> 02:31.429
What does that mean?

02:32.749 --> 02:34.123
She's nice, but,

02:34.148 --> 02:37.663
she's always had certain
expectations about the men I date.

02:37.696 --> 02:38.764
Your mom didn't lie.

02:38.797 --> 02:41.466
- I didn't mean to lie.
- Mmm.

02:41.499 --> 02:43.654
And it was more of an omission
than an outright lie.

02:43.687 --> 02:46.204
So, when you were shuffling us
around making sure we never met,

02:46.238 --> 02:47.300
that was just what?

02:47.571 --> 02:48.706
That was wrong.

02:49.213 --> 02:50.187
Ah.

02:51.088 --> 02:54.090
Look, if you're embarrassed to let
anyone know that we're dating,

02:55.553 --> 02:56.454
then why are we dating?

02:59.823 --> 03:01.192
I'll see you.

03:17.741 --> 03:18.776
Mom.

03:20.003 --> 03:21.137
What you got there?

03:26.383 --> 03:27.619
I remember making this for Daddy.

03:28.919 --> 03:30.121
You miss him?

03:31.307 --> 03:33.701
Sam helps you miss him
a little less, doesn't he?

03:34.491 --> 03:36.862
I know that's why you don't
wanna take this driving test.

03:38.341 --> 03:40.511
You don't want the time you
spend with Sam to be over.

03:41.198 --> 03:42.233
No.

03:45.502 --> 03:49.140
- Yes, but it's okay.
- You can talk to me.

03:51.976 --> 03:53.777
Talking to you will
just make things worse.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.181
'Cause it will make you sad, Mom,

03:57.215 --> 03:58.904
and that'll just make me miss him more.

04:00.283 --> 04:03.253
Look, I can feel how badly

04:03.287 --> 04:05.078
you wanna try and make
the situation better for me,

04:05.110 --> 04:06.625
but you can't.

04:07.691 --> 04:08.692
No one can.

04:12.496 --> 04:14.531
Okay, I have to go
because I think Nick's waiting.

04:14.565 --> 04:15.966
Okay, I love you.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.168
I love you more.

04:20.437 --> 04:22.173
Hi, sweetheart.

04:22.693 --> 04:24.535
Mom, what's going on?

04:24.908 --> 04:25.911
I'm moving in.

04:27.076 --> 04:28.312
Into the spare room.

04:28.346 --> 04:30.682
Your father and I both
wanna live with you,

04:30.715 --> 04:32.482
so this is the perfect solution.

04:32.515 --> 04:34.451
But temporary solution.

04:35.686 --> 04:38.590
- What do you think, Nick?
- Great.

04:38.623 --> 04:41.359
- Ugh, what a mess.
- No. You don't have to do that.

04:41.391 --> 04:43.875
- Yeah, I'll do it.
- Thank you.

04:45.057 --> 04:47.498
No, no, no, no, no.
That goes in the disposal.

04:47.530 --> 04:49.434
No, you can't put anything
large in that disposal.

04:49.467 --> 04:51.736
It's delicate and clogs up easily.

04:51.768 --> 04:54.905
Sam, you're being silly. Disposals
are meant to handle food.

04:54.939 --> 04:57.826
This particular disposal can't handle
more than a few grains of rice.

04:57.907 --> 04:59.410
Yeah, he's right.

04:59.443 --> 05:00.878
Okay, I get it.

05:00.910 --> 05:03.480
Your house, no food
in the disposal, got it.

05:03.906 --> 05:05.008
Right.

05:06.549 --> 05:08.084
Ben is very sweet.

05:08.419 --> 05:09.821
He is that.

05:09.854 --> 05:11.923
And successful. Self-made man.

05:11.955 --> 05:13.825
- Mom.
- What?

05:13.857 --> 05:16.456
Don't pretend for a second
that you're okay with Ben.

05:17.027 --> 05:18.662
- Why wouldn't I be?
- Ah.

05:18.696 --> 05:19.998
He's not your type.

05:20.030 --> 05:21.566
And what is my type?

05:22.366 --> 05:23.668
Rich.

05:24.342 --> 05:28.938
I have dated and married wealthy
men and not so wealthy men.

05:29.306 --> 05:31.309
I don't have a problem with Ben.

05:32.677 --> 05:33.977
But I think you might.

05:34.011 --> 05:37.914
You should've seen him. He was so upset.

05:37.948 --> 05:41.986
If you really care about Ben, you
have to fight. Win him back.

05:42.018 --> 05:44.756
But you have always said
men should do the chasing.

05:44.789 --> 05:48.660
Stephanie, you are choosing to listen
to what I said decades ago

05:48.693 --> 05:51.046
instead of what I'm saying right now.

05:51.561 --> 05:55.039
For the record, my last
marriage was my happiest.

05:55.073 --> 05:55.999
Joey.

05:56.032 --> 05:58.369
And I had to pursue him
all the way to Vegas.

06:03.243 --> 06:05.576
What's up with you
not getting your license?

06:05.609 --> 06:06.962
I'm not ready.

06:06.996 --> 06:09.614
You're not ready for a test? No way.

06:10.715 --> 06:12.834
This one is different, okay?

06:13.583 --> 06:14.518
Can we please have two bagels?

06:15.018 --> 06:16.025
Thanks.

06:16.653 --> 06:19.290
So, I heard that your mom
is moving out of Grey House.

06:20.124 --> 06:23.695
Uh, yeah, she's moving in with us.

06:23.727 --> 06:26.698
Okay. And how come
you don't look happier?

06:26.730 --> 06:29.385
I wanted there to be peace
with everyone, but...

06:30.233 --> 06:32.302
I never thought
she'd be living at my Dad's.

06:33.671 --> 06:35.294
She always has to be right.

06:35.539 --> 06:37.775
Oh, can you talk to her?
Tell her how you feel?

06:37.807 --> 06:39.377
She wouldn't listen.

06:39.643 --> 06:40.845
Okay, well then, maybe
your dad can help her.

06:40.878 --> 06:42.689
I don't wanna cause trouble.

06:43.381 --> 06:45.750
If my dad says something
to my mom, then...

06:45.782 --> 06:46.883
- Trouble?
- Yeah.

06:46.917 --> 06:47.877
Got it.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.788
Look, my mom got what she wanted.

06:51.522 --> 06:52.679
She always does.

06:54.458 --> 06:57.362
- What about you, Nick?
- Does it matter?

06:57.395 --> 06:58.930
Of course, it does.

06:58.963 --> 07:00.465
Are you feeling bad for me?

07:00.498 --> 07:01.632
Kind of.

07:01.664 --> 07:03.501
- Thanks.
- Good.

07:03.534 --> 07:05.103
Then you can buy me my bagel.

07:05.136 --> 07:07.804
- Ah. Smooth.
- Ah. Yeah, real smooth.

07:07.838 --> 07:09.808
Thank you.

07:11.941 --> 07:13.357
See you tomorrow.

07:14.781 --> 07:19.550
Hey. I, uh, just wanna thank you
again for taking care of my nephew.

07:20.150 --> 07:21.552
- Here.
- What's this?

07:21.585 --> 07:24.922
It's a gift certificate for that French
restaurant in Blairsville.

07:24.955 --> 07:26.824
- Oh, fancy.
- Yeah, well.

07:26.857 --> 07:30.094
I was gonna bring Tara to the bistro
for lunch but this is much nicer.

07:30.895 --> 07:33.030
You didn't have to do this,
though, I mean, Max was great.

07:33.063 --> 07:34.966
Yeah, he's a sweet baby.

07:34.999 --> 07:36.833
But look, man, babies are a lot of work.

07:36.866 --> 07:38.068
Yes, they are.

07:38.102 --> 07:40.299
Bet you Tara loved Max, though, right?

07:40.970 --> 07:43.006
Sure, I mean, who doesn't love a baby?

07:44.174 --> 07:45.576
You need a puppy, my friend.

07:45.609 --> 07:47.810
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, you gotta get a puppy.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.298
 It'll buy you some time.

07:49.330 --> 07:52.482
My brother, before he had
Max, had Bella, a rescue lab.

07:52.515 --> 07:55.619
That dog must've bought
him like three years.

07:55.652 --> 07:58.422
- A puppy?
- Yeah, works like a charm.

08:06.963 --> 08:09.077
- Would you like some company?
- Of course.

08:10.834 --> 08:12.770
How's the work coming, any progress?

08:12.802 --> 08:15.566
No, I'm afraid you were right.

08:16.105 --> 08:18.755
Stephanie's not the answer
to my writer's block.

08:19.143 --> 08:22.392
Every day, I feel
my wife's voice slipping away.

08:22.879 --> 08:25.515
Well, I can tell you from experience
that she's still there.

08:25.549 --> 08:27.146
I wish that I believed you.

08:27.885 --> 08:30.769
Belief is just a wish you make happen.

08:31.381 --> 08:34.826
Thank you for everything,
but I think it's time to go home.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.873
Would you stop by Grey
House before you leave?

08:38.898 --> 08:40.465
 I have a gift for you.

08:40.498 --> 08:43.234
You've given me enough.
It's not necessary.

08:43.265 --> 08:45.350
Oh, it is necessary.

08:45.936 --> 08:47.772
Then I'll come by tomorrow
on my way out of town.

08:54.110 --> 08:55.479
Come in.

08:56.946 --> 08:57.981
Hi.

08:59.649 --> 09:01.885
So, all your test results
came back negative.

09:01.918 --> 09:04.688
- False positive.
- Excuse me?

09:04.721 --> 09:06.256
Labs make mistakes all the time.

09:06.290 --> 09:08.659
The only safe way
is to redo all the tests.

09:08.691 --> 09:12.308
And I have two new troubling
symptoms, dry eyes and dry mouth.

09:12.930 --> 09:14.999
Well, you're taking an antihistamine
with a decongestant.

09:15.032 --> 09:17.686
- It's a common side effect.
- Well, I'm allergic to horses.

09:18.536 --> 09:21.071
- Hmm. You have a horse?
- Yes, Mr. Butters.

09:23.273 --> 09:25.076
For a doctor,
you're very easy to talk to.

09:26.305 --> 09:29.113
Um, Eve mentioned you were single.

09:29.712 --> 09:30.881
Is that right?

09:40.724 --> 09:42.602
- Good morning, Cassie.
- John.

09:42.635 --> 09:45.398
- Did you get my flowers?
- The arrangement was beautiful.

09:45.995 --> 09:47.421
I found this book.

09:47.805 --> 09:49.806
It catalogs other
artifacts from the same

09:49.831 --> 09:52.127
period as your  Horse with Groom.

09:53.736 --> 09:56.139
Ha. Be still my heart.

09:56.974 --> 09:58.042
Wow.

10:00.143 --> 10:02.979
So, how goes it at
the university, settling in?

10:03.013 --> 10:05.544
Um, I'm about as settled
as I think I can get.

10:06.316 --> 10:08.251
But working at the university
does have its perks.

10:08.276 --> 10:09.629
Do you remember Bert Branter?

10:10.153 --> 10:13.590
Do I remember the foremost authority
on the Indus Valley Civilization?

10:13.624 --> 10:15.826
Yes, I remember him.
I even met him once.

10:15.859 --> 10:17.628
Well, he's speaking
at the university tonight.

10:18.896 --> 10:19.764
- You wanna come?
- Yes.

10:19.797 --> 10:21.165
It'll be fun.

10:21.197 --> 10:23.033
You're probably the only
person I can think of

10:23.066 --> 10:26.022
who would think a lecture on
the Indus Civilization is fun.

10:26.836 --> 10:28.639
Hmm, not the only person.

10:33.877 --> 10:38.049
Martha. I left Michael at home.
He was just getting up.

10:38.081 --> 10:40.750
Oh, poor lamb, he's exhausted.

10:40.783 --> 10:42.986
From staying out late
hanging out with his friends.

10:43.019 --> 10:44.287
He's very popular.

10:44.321 --> 10:46.724
He should be exhausted from working.

10:46.757 --> 10:51.329
A job will not keep him here,
in Middleton, but a career will.

10:51.361 --> 10:54.197
He needs to be gainfully
employed by the end of the week.

10:54.230 --> 10:58.001
Things are in the works.
Irons and fires all over.

10:58.034 --> 10:59.736
Don't worry, I've got this.

10:59.769 --> 11:01.638
What happened with the job at the bank?

11:01.672 --> 11:03.774
Sadly, that interview didn't pan out.

11:04.340 --> 11:05.558
He didn't get the job?

11:06.377 --> 11:07.955
He didn't go to the interview.

11:07.987 --> 11:10.780
That job wasn't right for Michael.

11:10.813 --> 11:12.949
He shouldn't be an assistant at his age.

11:12.983 --> 11:14.652
Enough is enough.

11:14.685 --> 11:17.188
Either you have a talk
with Michael or I will.

11:18.022 --> 11:19.290
But, Tom.

11:26.830 --> 11:29.166
Ahem.

11:29.199 --> 11:31.302
Seems my sign has hopped
across the street.

11:31.335 --> 11:33.070
I had a feeling I might find it here.

11:33.103 --> 11:35.664
I had no choice. You know Sophie quit?

11:35.697 --> 11:38.140
There are no shortcuts to
finding the right employee.

11:39.008 --> 11:41.345
I don't have time to meet
with a bunch of people.

11:41.378 --> 11:44.382
I think you're looking for an easy
solution to a complicated problem.

11:44.415 --> 11:45.717
What does that mean?

11:45.749 --> 11:48.753
That finding someone to replace
Sophie isn't your only issue.

11:49.887 --> 11:51.321
Yes, it is.

11:51.354 --> 11:54.358
Look, I have 50 centerpieces
to finish tomorrow night.

11:54.391 --> 11:57.798
I need help, and everybody
I know seems to be busy.

11:58.361 --> 12:01.098
You think my sign will bring
in someone to do all the work for you?

12:01.398 --> 12:02.741
Yes.

12:03.332 --> 12:05.435
You already tried that with Sophie.

12:05.469 --> 12:08.939
Cassie, your sign is simply the easiest
and quickest solution to my problem.

12:08.971 --> 12:10.307
Okay? End of story.

12:13.009 --> 12:14.011
I thought it was great.

12:16.379 --> 12:18.682
- Where have you two been?
- Poulter Academy.

12:19.249 --> 12:20.784
Why would you be there?

12:20.817 --> 12:22.052
I set up a tour for Nick.

12:24.053 --> 12:26.289
- Nick has a school.
- Yes, but...

12:26.322 --> 12:27.824
And he's doing very well, there.

12:28.492 --> 12:30.662
Um, and I have homework.

12:35.199 --> 12:36.718
Did he say he wanted to switch schools?

12:36.750 --> 12:39.970
No, but I can tell that he isn't
being challenged at Middleton.

12:40.003 --> 12:43.340
If he has a prayer of getting into a
decent college, he needs a better school.

12:43.373 --> 12:46.167
Are you trying to drive him away?

12:46.946 --> 12:49.782
Because if that's your intention,
you're doing a bang-up job.

12:50.754 --> 12:53.116
If he wanted me to stop,
he would ask me to.

12:53.149 --> 12:55.654
Seriously, leave him alone.

12:56.085 --> 12:57.688
He's not a project, he's your son.

13:01.057 --> 13:02.393
I thought Linda got all her bags.

13:04.791 --> 13:06.863
Linda has a lot of baggage.

13:07.853 --> 13:10.491
Well, I bet Nick is happy
to have her back home.

13:10.868 --> 13:14.071
He's not. Linda can be overbearing.

13:14.104 --> 13:17.475
Hmm, people who are controlling
are usually driven by fear.

13:17.508 --> 13:19.861
I think Linda just likes
to tell people what to do.

13:20.811 --> 13:22.213
You know, Nick is lucky to have you.

13:22.245 --> 13:24.004
Ah, he's a good kid.

13:24.514 --> 13:25.584
If putting up with Linda,

13:25.609 --> 13:28.918
is what it takes, well,
that's a sacrifice worth making.

13:28.951 --> 13:31.287
When it comes to your child, there
isn't anything you wouldn't do.

13:31.321 --> 13:33.007
I'm not the only one.

13:34.391 --> 13:37.962
You're awfully dressed up for
a Wednesday night. Hot date?

13:37.994 --> 13:40.163
Hot lecture on the
Indus Valley Civilization.

13:41.808 --> 13:44.100
John knows how to show
a lady a good time.

13:44.133 --> 13:45.250
- Do you wanna come?
- No.

13:45.275 --> 13:48.505
I had enough of the Indus people at my
third year cultural anthropology class.

13:48.538 --> 13:51.475
- Hmm.
- I was desperate for an elective.

13:51.508 --> 13:54.078
Emphasis on the desperate.

13:54.110 --> 13:55.812
- But you have a good time.
- Oh, I will.

13:55.845 --> 13:58.448
- Need a ride?
- Isn't that out of your way?

13:58.481 --> 14:01.151
Oh, it's only about eight or ten miles
from the place I ordered pizza.

14:01.185 --> 14:03.888
Oh, yeah, yeah. No problem, I
actually have a ride, but next time.

14:04.888 --> 14:05.790
Okay.

14:15.264 --> 14:16.432
Hi.

14:16.465 --> 14:19.003
- I'm working.
- I know.

14:21.404 --> 14:25.842
Brought your favorites.
BLT, fries and two desserts.

14:25.875 --> 14:26.910
Thanks.

14:28.579 --> 14:30.247
You didn't need to do this.

14:30.279 --> 14:31.915
I'm really sorry for what I did.

14:34.084 --> 14:36.154
It was wrong of me, lying to you.

14:37.253 --> 14:38.789
I've been doing some thinking.

14:41.225 --> 14:44.327
When we first met, you thought we
were too different to be together.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.429
I just needed to learn to be more open.

14:46.462 --> 14:49.152
That's just it. I don't think that's
how a relationship should work.

14:49.806 --> 14:50.941
You shouldn't have to learn
to wanna be with me.

14:52.502 --> 14:53.503
You should just wanna be with me,

14:54.571 --> 14:55.973
not be embarrassed.

14:58.975 --> 15:00.477
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

15:03.046 --> 15:03.915
Ben.

15:10.921 --> 15:12.388
My treat, for the lecture.

15:12.422 --> 15:14.457
Uh, no, no. You came with me, my treat.

15:19.528 --> 15:20.911
We can eat first.

15:21.531 --> 15:24.001
Then, we'll have the strength to
arm-wrestle each other for the bill.

15:24.033 --> 15:27.104
I really enjoyed the lecture.

15:27.137 --> 15:30.340
I could tell, you asked
more questions than anyone.

15:30.374 --> 15:32.008
I can't believe Bert remembered me.

15:33.343 --> 15:34.880
You are kind of unforgettable.

15:35.739 --> 15:40.076
So, I have this, uh, Formal Archeology
Department function tomorrow night.

15:40.350 --> 15:41.585
And I don't have a plus one.

15:42.351 --> 15:43.833
Anna can't make it.

15:44.354 --> 15:46.590
You'll have to dress up
and it'll likely be boring,

15:46.623 --> 15:49.193
including bad food and bad speeches,

15:49.654 --> 15:53.496
but I'd love to have at least
one person there I know.

15:53.529 --> 15:56.432
Hmm. With a buildup like that,
how could I say "no"?

15:56.465 --> 15:58.076
- Is that a "yes"?
- That's a "yes".

15:59.201 --> 16:00.436
I think I like hearing you say "yes".

16:00.470 --> 16:02.273
Well, then ask me if I'm hungry.

16:02.306 --> 16:03.540
- Are you hungry?
- Yes, let's order.

16:03.572 --> 16:04.975
All right.

16:11.648 --> 16:12.550
Thank you.

16:14.283 --> 16:15.886
I'm glad we got to do this.

16:17.586 --> 16:18.655
Dad?

16:19.523 --> 16:20.657
What's up?

16:22.359 --> 16:25.545
I'm supposed to be at school and
you're supposed to be at work.

16:26.296 --> 16:30.549
Yeah, speaking of school,
do you really wanna switch?

16:31.500 --> 16:34.099
- Yeah, it'll be easier.
- Than what?

16:35.339 --> 16:38.676
You know, when Mom wants something,
it's easier just to go along.

16:38.709 --> 16:43.214
Yes, but if you don't
wanna go to private school...

16:45.047 --> 16:46.210
Hey, you have a say in this.

16:47.283 --> 16:49.807
Your opinion matters.
What you want matters.

16:50.519 --> 16:52.250
But Mom likes it her way.

16:53.356 --> 16:55.591
And you're afraid if you don't go
along with what your mother wants...

16:55.624 --> 16:57.928
Dad, it's fine, okay?

16:59.462 --> 17:00.597
It's between me and Mom.

17:04.334 --> 17:05.536
Yoo-hoo!

17:05.569 --> 17:07.538
Martha.

17:07.570 --> 17:09.473
Is that a new jacket? It's very bold.

17:09.505 --> 17:11.007
Oh, well, I...

17:12.829 --> 17:15.499
My dinner has been moved up by an hour.

17:15.744 --> 17:18.013
- No problem.
- How are my centerpieces?

17:18.047 --> 17:19.515
You know, I think I'm gonna
actually have to slow down

17:19.549 --> 17:21.416
because they'll be ready too soon.

17:21.450 --> 17:24.057
- Nobody wants wilted flowers at a dinner.
- There's only two!

17:24.257 --> 17:28.191
I will need all 50 there at least
one hour before the dinner starts.

17:28.224 --> 17:30.260
They will be there,
on time and ready to go.

17:30.292 --> 17:32.153
I saw your help wanted sign.

17:32.178 --> 17:35.599
I hope I don't need to remind you
how important this dinner is to me,

17:35.631 --> 17:37.500
to my position in the community.

17:38.467 --> 17:40.536
- I understand.
- Well, good.

17:40.570 --> 17:42.406
Because I'd hate for you
to get a reputation

17:42.438 --> 17:45.442
as a businesswoman
whose word cannot be trusted.

17:46.042 --> 17:47.110
Hmm.

17:55.752 --> 17:58.088
Ah, did you see that truck I passed?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.023
Better than that, it saw you.

18:00.057 --> 18:01.458
True.

18:01.491 --> 18:03.227
And you still don't
wanna take your test?

18:03.260 --> 18:04.606
Ugh, no, I'm not ready yet.

18:06.073 --> 18:08.098
Wait, unless you think I'm
taking up too much of your time?

18:08.130 --> 18:11.802
I promised that these lessons would end up
with you getting your license, and they will.

18:11.834 --> 18:14.204
- However long it takes.
- Thanks.

18:15.205 --> 18:17.808
Wow, your office is really cool.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.176
Nobody's ever called a
doctor's office "cool" before.

18:21.208 --> 18:24.982
Well, it's not just the office,
it's what you do here.

18:25.581 --> 18:29.285
And I love science. I'm in
AP chemistry and biology.

18:29.319 --> 18:32.321
Double-threat. Should I call ahead
to Stanford and reserve your room?

18:32.355 --> 18:34.625
I actually wanna go to Yale.

18:34.657 --> 18:36.325
I'm also in AP physics.

18:36.359 --> 18:38.294
- Is that all?
- Hey!

18:38.328 --> 18:42.499
Oh, um, I'm so sorry to drive and run,

18:42.532 --> 18:44.534
but I'm gonna be late for my study group.
I'll see you later.

18:44.568 --> 18:46.404
- Hey, Grace.
- Yeah?

18:47.369 --> 18:49.506
- Nice job today.
- Thank you.

18:50.573 --> 18:51.675
Hi.

18:52.475 --> 18:53.388
Oh.

18:53.877 --> 18:56.047
Is this, uh, Grace's?

19:17.167 --> 19:18.635
Hello.

19:18.667 --> 19:21.205
Hi. Cassie asked me to come by.

19:21.237 --> 19:22.806
Are you, by any chance, Carl Winstead?

19:24.373 --> 19:25.708
Wow!

19:25.742 --> 19:30.848
- I am such a fan.
- Thank you.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.722
I was just reading this
or, rereading this.

19:34.251 --> 19:37.120
Apparently, Cassie's a fan too.
She has all your books.

19:37.154 --> 19:41.558
This is the third time I've read this
and I still, I can't put it down.

19:41.590 --> 19:42.825
That's sweet of you to say.

19:42.859 --> 19:46.163
You write the most
beautiful love stories.

19:46.196 --> 19:49.765
My wife, she taught me a lot about love.

19:49.799 --> 19:52.869
- Ah, so, she's your muse.
- Yes.

19:52.903 --> 19:56.540
You know, when my husband
died, I was inconsolable.

19:56.572 --> 19:58.809
And a friend gave me one of your books.

19:58.841 --> 20:00.143
And reading your novels,

20:01.311 --> 20:04.715
somehow allowed me to forget for a bit

20:05.381 --> 20:06.649
how sad I was.

20:07.551 --> 20:08.807
Got me through the first year.

20:09.619 --> 20:11.688
I recently lost my wife.

20:13.049 --> 20:14.084
I'm so sorry.

20:14.791 --> 20:18.167
Yeah, it's been overwhelming.

20:18.727 --> 20:20.163
Of course, it is.

20:22.198 --> 20:24.458
What are you doing for yourself?

20:25.202 --> 20:27.912
To keep your mind
not quite so focused on grief?

20:28.838 --> 20:30.491
You have to find something.

20:31.125 --> 20:33.144
It's the only way you're gonna
get through it and survive.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.806
Where's my PlayStation?

20:47.756 --> 20:50.886
Your father, he lets you play
way too many videogames.

20:51.761 --> 20:53.664
Honestly, just try it
for a week, you'll see.

20:54.863 --> 20:57.340
Hey, come here for a sec.

20:58.036 --> 21:01.399
Listen, I was thinking that I would
come and watch your practice today.

21:01.937 --> 21:04.749
Uh, it might be canceled.

21:05.375 --> 21:08.222
It might be canceled?
Is it canceled or not?

21:08.878 --> 21:10.654
I'm, I'm not sure.

21:12.415 --> 21:16.619
Nicky, you know I can tell when
you're not telling the truth, right?

21:16.653 --> 21:18.855
It's right there, the raised eyebrow.
It's your tell.

21:18.888 --> 21:21.225
Ever since you were three years old

21:21.257 --> 21:24.360
and knocked that vase over in our
living room and blamed it on the dog.

21:24.394 --> 21:25.971
We didn't have a dog.

21:26.428 --> 21:29.733
Exactly! Not a good liar then,
not a good liar now.

21:31.935 --> 21:35.572
Mom, I don't wanna be on the team.

21:37.059 --> 21:38.507
Nick, you've made a commitment.

21:38.541 --> 21:40.377
Yeah, but still...

21:40.409 --> 21:41.978
And you're very good at it.

21:42.012 --> 21:43.414
But I don't like it.

21:45.201 --> 21:47.516
Oh, look, it's only until
the end of the year.

21:47.550 --> 21:48.851
Next year, you'll be at Poulter,

21:48.885 --> 21:50.253
and if you don't wanna play basketball,

21:50.286 --> 21:51.721
then, sweetheart, you don't have to.

21:53.532 --> 21:56.226
Poulter has an excellent squash team.
They're nationally ranked.

21:57.560 --> 21:58.494
You like squash.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.468
- Hey, there.
- Oh, hey, Sam.

22:05.502 --> 22:06.710
This is Grace's.

22:07.003 --> 22:09.925
Oh, she'd be heartbroken
if she lost this.

22:10.674 --> 22:13.061
She gave it to her father
when she was a little girl.

22:13.542 --> 22:16.302
I think I know why she doesn't
wanna take her driving test.

22:16.612 --> 22:17.680
She misses her dad so much.

22:18.348 --> 22:19.438
Yeah, I'm sorry.

22:19.983 --> 22:22.485
Hard enough losing Jake,
but watching Grace

22:22.519 --> 22:24.461
and Lori and Brandon
lose their father...

22:24.821 --> 22:26.388
I've never known loss like that.

22:26.755 --> 22:27.923
I hope you never do.

22:27.956 --> 22:30.727
And like everything you do,
you make it look effortless.

22:31.994 --> 22:34.732
You can talk to me about this, anytime.

22:36.143 --> 22:37.452
I'm a pretty good listener.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.970
Grace would be really upset if she
knew we were having this conversation.

22:41.003 --> 22:42.005
What conversation?

22:44.230 --> 22:46.743
There's nothing worse than
seeing your child in pain,

22:46.775 --> 22:49.013
knowing no matter what you do,
you can't fix it for them.

23:02.859 --> 23:05.124
Come in.

23:05.156 --> 23:07.350
- Hey.
- Michael!

23:09.292 --> 23:10.594
Come, come, sit.

23:14.062 --> 23:17.703
Michael, there is a slight
problem with your father.

23:19.034 --> 23:20.677
Is this about my cell phone bill?

23:20.764 --> 23:23.072
No... Wait, what bill?

23:23.104 --> 23:24.539
Never mind.

23:24.573 --> 23:28.592
No, your father is insisting
that you get a job.

23:28.977 --> 23:30.379
Now.

23:30.411 --> 23:34.182
Dad doesn't get me, but you do.

23:34.216 --> 23:37.196
That's why I love you. You're
always there to protect me.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.790
But don't worry, Mom, I have
a meeting later on today.

23:41.824 --> 23:43.738
You have a meeting for a job?

23:43.770 --> 23:44.959
Why didn't you tell me?

23:44.993 --> 23:46.529
Where? With whom? Can I help?

23:46.562 --> 23:48.130
I don't wanna jinx it.

23:48.162 --> 23:50.557
Say no more and I will ask no more.

23:51.333 --> 23:53.369
Oh, and I used your car
and it's on empty.

23:53.401 --> 23:54.903
Do you want me to fill it up for you?

23:54.937 --> 23:58.140
What a sweet and thoughtful gesture.

23:58.172 --> 23:59.539
Should I put it on your credit card?

24:01.276 --> 24:02.945
Oh.

24:06.414 --> 24:08.216
Thanks, Mom.

24:11.411 --> 24:15.256
And so, when everything gets back into
the lab, Eve'll give you a call, okay?

24:15.289 --> 24:16.526
It'll be fine.

24:19.460 --> 24:21.462
Sharon is trying to
schedule a bunch of tests.

24:21.496 --> 24:22.965
She's on her way back from the farm.

24:22.997 --> 24:25.266
I'll call her back.

24:25.299 --> 24:27.002
She's becoming a real pest.

24:29.103 --> 24:30.464
- What?
- Sorry.

24:30.605 --> 24:32.311
No, it's okay.

24:34.308 --> 24:37.846
It's great, actually. Call Sharon back.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.215
Get the number for that farm
where she boards her horse

24:39.247 --> 24:42.083
and get them on the phone for me, please.
As soon as you can.

24:45.320 --> 24:46.554
Ben broke up with me.

24:46.587 --> 24:48.645
He's being totally unreasonable.

24:50.424 --> 24:51.626
It's broken.

24:51.660 --> 24:54.028
Hello, we're talking here.

24:54.062 --> 24:58.167
As I was saying, Ben is being
completely unreasonable.

24:58.199 --> 24:59.434
When it comes to relationships,

24:59.468 --> 25:02.262
it's important to find someone
who loves you for who you are,

25:02.296 --> 25:06.308
but you have to love them for who
they are too and you have to admit,

25:06.341 --> 25:09.478
you haven't been as enthusiastic as
Ben has about the two of you dating.

25:09.510 --> 25:10.579
That's true.

25:11.452 --> 25:12.687
No one asked you.

25:12.833 --> 25:14.303
Okay, but it's still true.

25:15.919 --> 25:17.252
You know what I think?

25:17.652 --> 25:19.906
I think that maybe
all this is for the best.

25:20.836 --> 25:22.236
Ben and I don't belong together.

25:23.057 --> 25:24.959
Maybe we shouldn't
even have started dating.

25:24.993 --> 25:27.501
If you really believed that,
you wouldn't be here.

25:28.505 --> 25:29.418
No.

25:30.064 --> 25:31.555
I really think it's over.

25:36.683 --> 25:38.107
It's not working.

25:38.140 --> 25:40.676
It's not broken. You're
just not using it properly.

25:40.708 --> 25:43.912
Your intention was
to only serve yourself.

25:43.946 --> 25:45.955
But I won't be serving anybody,

25:45.989 --> 25:48.684
because there's no way I can
finish the centerpieces on time

25:48.717 --> 25:50.451
and Martha's going to take
my business tonight

25:50.485 --> 25:52.187
when her dinner is flower free.

25:52.219 --> 25:53.463
So, you're giving up?

25:54.523 --> 25:56.508
I can't do it. Not by myself.

25:57.225 --> 26:00.568
Wouldn't it be better to try
and fail than to just fail?

26:00.996 --> 26:03.232
No, what's the point
of putting in the effort

26:03.265 --> 26:05.301
if you know there's
no hope of succeeding?

26:05.776 --> 26:07.202
There's always hope.

26:08.469 --> 26:11.006
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:11.038 --> 26:12.275
Hi, Sam.

26:12.975 --> 26:14.401
Abigail.

26:14.977 --> 26:16.494
- I need to ask you a favor.
- Name it.

26:17.112 --> 26:19.180
May I take Grace to
the hospital, later today?

26:19.214 --> 26:20.549
Hospital?

26:20.582 --> 26:24.630
Oh, you know that thing that I'm not
supposed to know or talk about?

26:24.698 --> 26:25.766
Yeah?

26:25.876 --> 26:27.256
I got a plan.

26:27.288 --> 26:28.990
I think you're rubbing off on me.

26:29.024 --> 26:31.160
And taking her
to the hospital will help?

26:31.192 --> 26:32.716
Should be just what the doctor ordered.

26:33.260 --> 26:34.562
Pun intended.

26:36.408 --> 26:37.243
Well, good luck.

26:38.692 --> 26:39.968
I got this.

26:40.001 --> 26:41.970
Now, I have to go
see a man about a horse.

26:42.004 --> 26:43.005
Literally.

26:45.117 --> 26:49.477
I can't believe Sam is still on
the market. He's such a catch.

26:54.315 --> 26:56.184
So, what should we order?

26:56.218 --> 26:57.652
Well, when I thought
I might be pregnant,

26:57.686 --> 27:01.590
I went online, and there was a long
list of things you shouldn't eat.

27:01.622 --> 27:03.458
Oh, now you can have whatever you want.

27:04.793 --> 27:07.596
- Oysters?
- We can split a dozen.

27:07.629 --> 27:10.699
All right, but you order your
own souffle. I'm not sharing.

27:14.236 --> 27:16.855
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

27:17.506 --> 27:20.141
For being all over the place
about wanting to start a family.

27:20.174 --> 27:23.745
Hey, you are the sweetest,

27:23.778 --> 27:26.515
kindest, most caring person I know.

27:26.547 --> 27:30.352
You're already a great person, so
you're gonna make a great mom.

27:30.384 --> 27:31.557
Are you saying you're ready?

27:33.321 --> 27:34.975
What do you think about getting a puppy?

27:36.158 --> 27:37.459
A puppy?

27:45.964 --> 27:47.084
What happened to your room?

27:49.948 --> 27:50.854
Mom fixed it.

27:51.382 --> 27:52.552
Was it broken?

27:53.564 --> 27:55.565
- Dad.
- It's your room.

27:55.760 --> 27:58.509
Yeah, you always tell me it's a mess.

27:58.776 --> 28:00.812
And that I should move where my desk is.

28:00.844 --> 28:03.281
Well, I might think that,
but it's your space.

28:04.315 --> 28:05.449
Mom is...

28:05.483 --> 28:07.466
I can see you're not happy.

28:07.919 --> 28:09.523
But I should be.

28:10.088 --> 28:13.340
We're all together
and there's no fighting.

28:13.964 --> 28:14.965
But you're not.

28:15.959 --> 28:18.246
- I love Mom.
- She loves you.

28:18.862 --> 28:23.302
She hasn't lived with me since I
was a kid, not full time anyway.

28:25.402 --> 28:27.506
I can talk to your mom, if you want.

28:27.771 --> 28:28.937
Talk to me?

28:29.986 --> 28:31.021
About what?

28:31.342 --> 28:32.526
Um.

28:33.416 --> 28:37.739
Mom, wouldn't you be happier in
your own place or back in New York?

28:40.051 --> 28:42.087
Sam, did you put him up to this?

28:42.120 --> 28:43.822
No, no, no, no, no. This wasn't Dad.

28:46.056 --> 28:49.910
Nick, you don't know
what you need. I do.

28:50.594 --> 28:52.765
I have your best interests at heart.

28:55.432 --> 28:56.734
Nick.

29:00.691 --> 29:01.491
It's not okay.

29:03.941 --> 29:06.127
You're so determined to control him,

29:06.511 --> 29:07.579
that you're gonna lose him.

29:09.046 --> 29:10.706
You can make things easier for him.

29:12.550 --> 29:13.819
I just don't know if you will.

29:21.328 --> 29:24.298
So I needed to drop off some lab work and I
just thought you might wanna come with me.

29:24.331 --> 29:27.333
Thank you. This place is great.

29:27.367 --> 29:30.837
- We do share an affinity for science.
- We do.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.739
We don't get to see enough
of you, Dr. Radford.

29:34.164 --> 29:35.666
He's a fan favorite around here.

29:35.698 --> 29:37.500
Thank you.

29:37.533 --> 29:39.469
The nurses really like you here.

29:39.502 --> 29:41.108
Oh, well, this place
has a terrific staff.

29:41.737 --> 29:42.905
What is this?

29:42.938 --> 29:45.475
I decided to take on an intern or two

29:45.509 --> 29:47.511
from your high school at my office.

29:47.543 --> 29:49.713
And as soon as I get the
principal to sign on, it's a go.

29:50.847 --> 29:51.848
For somebody interested in science,

29:51.881 --> 29:53.883
it would be a really good
learning experience.

29:55.018 --> 29:57.351
- You know anybody?
- Why me?

29:58.821 --> 30:03.526
Look, um, I see a lot of people
at their very worst moments.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.025
Especially when I was
running the ER in New York.

30:06.663 --> 30:09.528
Death and dying is part of
what I deal with every day.

30:10.099 --> 30:12.903
But I've learned that one
way to heal from loss

30:12.935 --> 30:14.769
is to give your heart
something else to love.

30:15.204 --> 30:17.006
Not to replace what it is you lost,

30:17.040 --> 30:18.642
but just to make the emptiness

30:19.242 --> 30:21.675
less empty.

30:24.281 --> 30:26.146
I know you miss your dad.

30:26.750 --> 30:30.179
And I wish I had more to offer
you than an internship.

30:32.254 --> 30:33.332
But what do you say?

30:36.225 --> 30:38.228
I say, I better schedule
my driving test.

30:38.861 --> 30:40.531
You're ready.

30:40.563 --> 30:42.198
I am, thanks to you.

30:48.704 --> 30:53.076
The question my heroine
poses to herself is,

30:53.108 --> 30:57.281
"Can you have a once in a life
time love twice in a lifetime?"

30:58.714 --> 30:59.916
Sorry I'm late.

30:59.949 --> 31:03.886
Oh, don't apologize, this has
been a real treat for me.

31:03.919 --> 31:07.189
- I didn't recognize that passage.
- It's from his upcoming book.

31:07.223 --> 31:09.792
It's something I started
before my wife died.

31:09.826 --> 31:12.691
It's beautiful.
You really should finish it.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.369
A gift is totally unnecessary.

31:23.765 --> 31:24.367
Open it.

31:27.459 --> 31:30.452
I acquired this notebook
at an estate sale in England.

31:31.047 --> 31:35.502
The woman who sold it to me said that
the owner was a famous English writer.

31:36.086 --> 31:39.318
Apparently, it was the only
blank notebook in his library.

31:39.648 --> 31:42.291
She said he kept it to remind him
of the darkest time in his life.

31:42.324 --> 31:44.515
A time he lost his voice.

31:46.663 --> 31:48.065
It's too much.

31:48.098 --> 31:50.801
I was just holding it,
waiting for the right person.

31:51.145 --> 31:52.442
And that's me?

31:53.608 --> 31:57.314
This inspiration you have, it
doesn't lie within anyone else.

31:57.906 --> 31:59.608
Not your lovely wife.

32:00.409 --> 32:03.179
It's in you, and only you
have the power to unlock it.

32:06.081 --> 32:08.116
Your wife is always with you.

32:09.185 --> 32:11.589
You don't have to find her. She's
always there, in your heart.

32:14.156 --> 32:17.360
If you give up writing, you'll
have lost two things you love.

32:18.227 --> 32:19.966
And your fans need you.

32:20.662 --> 32:22.164
There's a shortage of
love stories in the world.

32:24.967 --> 32:26.586
Well, then, I better keep writing.

32:28.405 --> 32:31.294
Thank you, Cassie
Nightingale, for everything.

32:35.145 --> 32:36.911
You think I have Lyme disease?

32:39.683 --> 32:40.730
How?

32:41.283 --> 32:44.120
It's passed into the bloodstream
through the bite of a deer tick.

32:44.154 --> 32:45.955
But I'm not around deer.

32:45.989 --> 32:48.892
Your horse is. At that
farm, where you board him.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.894
But all those other doctors I saw?

32:50.926 --> 32:54.795
The test for Lyme disease is unreliable
until after the first two months.

32:55.264 --> 32:58.967
In the early stages, the flu-like
symptoms are often misdiagnosed.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.103
You're sure?

33:01.137 --> 33:02.639
Both the tests came back positive.

33:08.243 --> 33:09.745
Can I get better?

33:09.779 --> 33:13.225
Sure, but it might be
a long road to recovery.

33:13.907 --> 33:18.404
And you may have some permanent side
effects that you have to monitor, treat...

33:19.321 --> 33:22.225
But I'm gonna do everything in my
power to get you feeling better.

33:23.358 --> 33:24.876
And you won't be alone.

33:25.227 --> 33:27.130
I'll be with you every step of the way.

33:28.964 --> 33:30.733
- Thank you, Dr. Radford.
- Sure.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.424
I know you want to say it.

33:39.908 --> 33:42.103
I don't need to say, "I told you so."

33:42.779 --> 33:45.949
Or that I was right and you
were wrong about Sharon.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.696
But you just did.

33:48.350 --> 33:49.650
- Did I?
- Mmm-hmm.

34:15.864 --> 34:18.772
_

34:30.058 --> 34:31.127
Hey, Sam.

34:32.395 --> 34:34.965
- Hmm, you want some tea?
- Uh, no thanks.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.975
Erythropoietin.

34:39.302 --> 34:42.806
The hormone that regulates the
rate of erythrocyte production.

34:42.839 --> 34:45.208
- 35 across.
- Mmm-hmm. Thank you.

34:45.241 --> 34:47.310
I can't stand to start a
puzzle and not finish it.

34:47.342 --> 34:49.411
We have that in common.

34:49.444 --> 34:51.981
- Hey, Mom.
- Oh, hey, Sam.

34:52.014 --> 34:53.916
- Hey.
- Did you tell her yet?

34:53.949 --> 34:56.886
- Uh, I was just about to.
- Tell me what?

34:56.920 --> 34:59.227
I'm going to be
interning at Sam's office.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.858
- If that's okay with you?
- Of course.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.460
Uh, but I need to take
my driving test first.

35:03.493 --> 35:05.529
That way, I can fully
concentrate on the internship.

35:05.561 --> 35:06.862
Well, congratulations.

35:06.895 --> 35:08.564
I'm totally psyched.

35:08.598 --> 35:10.744
- Thanks again, Sam.
- Sure.

35:13.268 --> 35:15.197
Thanks for helping me solve that puzzle.

35:16.172 --> 35:18.420
You know there isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
guys.

35:18.626 --> 35:19.306
Hmm.

35:22.378 --> 35:24.481
Nick told me that you were here.

35:24.514 --> 35:27.517
So listen, the disposal is backed up,

35:27.549 --> 35:29.919
and it's making these grinding noises.

35:30.987 --> 35:32.836
Clearly, it's defective.

35:33.255 --> 35:34.491
Clearly.

35:36.089 --> 35:37.272
Yeah, excuse me.

35:37.393 --> 35:38.561
Thanks, Sam.

35:42.398 --> 35:45.035
So, I Imagine you've heard that

35:45.067 --> 35:48.604
Sam got Nick to support the idea
of me going back to New York?

35:48.637 --> 35:51.407
No, Sam hasn't said a word,
but knowing Nick,

35:51.440 --> 35:53.276
he's speaking his own mind, not Sam's.

35:54.409 --> 35:56.028
Cassie, he's a child.

35:56.511 --> 36:00.983
No, look again. You aren't seeing
Nick for the young man he is.

36:01.016 --> 36:03.587
Well, either way, it doesn't matter
because with both of them against me,

36:03.619 --> 36:06.864
I am not gonna win this war.

36:08.090 --> 36:10.419
It's not a war. It's your family.

36:10.806 --> 36:12.774
And it's not about winning,
it's about love.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.502
Nick, can you come here?

36:28.843 --> 36:29.911
Mom?

36:32.348 --> 36:34.321
Sweetheart, I, um...

36:35.051 --> 36:37.420
I have a little bit of bad news.

36:37.453 --> 36:41.217
It seems that my CFO
has unexpectedly quit,

36:41.776 --> 36:44.842
and the board is requiring me to
go back to New York right away.

36:45.929 --> 36:48.350
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

36:48.697 --> 36:50.599
Oh, no.

36:50.632 --> 36:52.780
No, honey, I'm... I'm...

36:53.168 --> 36:55.737
I'm not going because of
anything that you said.

36:56.449 --> 37:01.378
I know that you were upset, and we all say
things we don't mean when we're upset.

37:01.411 --> 37:04.028
This has everything to do with my job,

37:04.647 --> 37:06.215
which I have to be in New York to do.

37:07.317 --> 37:10.253
I have an entire company
depending on me.

37:10.286 --> 37:11.425
And you, you have your...

37:13.623 --> 37:15.325
You have your dad here
to take care of you.

37:17.427 --> 37:19.162
You'll be back, right?

37:19.194 --> 37:22.031
Of course, and you will come visit me.

37:25.233 --> 37:26.436
I will.

37:27.503 --> 37:28.535
Love you, Mom.

37:29.005 --> 37:30.040
I love you, too.

37:34.243 --> 37:35.578
All right.

37:40.414 --> 37:41.217
Thank you.

37:43.485 --> 37:44.654
I love my son.

37:47.276 --> 37:48.578
Then you did the right thing.

37:51.094 --> 37:53.262
Martha, did I miss it?

37:53.295 --> 37:54.697
The ballroom is empty,
did I get the time wrong?

37:54.730 --> 37:57.099
I didn't have a truck, so I had to
carry them by hand and then, I...

37:57.132 --> 37:58.435
No, you didn't miss it.

37:58.467 --> 38:01.070
The dinner is not in the ballroom.
It's in Conference Room B,

38:01.103 --> 38:02.533
which is down the hall and to the left.

38:03.473 --> 38:06.308
Go and find Chief Sanders and he'll get
you some help to carry the centerpieces.

38:06.342 --> 38:08.412
I have to go and finish working
on my opening remarks.

38:09.045 --> 38:11.547
Oh, my. That is stunning!

38:12.148 --> 38:13.164
Thanks.

38:13.196 --> 38:17.353
You know, there is a City Council
welcome luncheon next week.

38:17.386 --> 38:19.188
I'm gonna phone you later with my order.

38:20.523 --> 38:22.358
- Abigail?
- Yeah?

38:22.391 --> 38:25.194
You're five feet
from the finish line, dear.

38:25.228 --> 38:27.329
Go and get those flowers where
they're supposed to be.

38:27.362 --> 38:28.531
Chop-chop.

38:34.737 --> 38:36.272
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

38:36.304 --> 38:37.573
My pleasure.

38:37.607 --> 38:39.608
Sorry, no food.

38:39.641 --> 38:41.377
I tried to get the last
two cheese blintzes,

38:41.411 --> 38:44.280
but sadly, I lost that to
a tenured literature prof.

38:44.313 --> 38:45.115
Forgive me.

38:45.748 --> 38:48.018
- John.
- Hey, Bill.

38:48.051 --> 38:49.451
And this must be Anna.

38:49.485 --> 38:50.720
Uh...

38:50.753 --> 38:52.489
- Cassie.
- My mistake.

38:52.522 --> 38:55.157
Oh. It's okay. Cassie's an old
friend from my college days.

38:55.190 --> 38:56.558
So you two went to
college together, huh?

38:56.592 --> 38:58.791
- We did.
- Yeah. We haven't seen each other

38:58.816 --> 39:00.429
in 20 years, and now we're both
living in Middleton.

39:00.462 --> 39:03.399
- Amazing.
- Yeah. You're right. It is amazing.

39:03.433 --> 39:05.335
So, when will Anna be joining you?

39:06.369 --> 39:08.371
Uh, she won't.

39:08.404 --> 39:11.507
We decided to make our
temporary break permanent.

39:11.540 --> 39:13.009
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

39:14.643 --> 39:17.312
- That's the Dean. If you'll excuse me.
- Sure.

39:17.346 --> 39:18.281
Thanks.

39:20.215 --> 39:21.284
Hmm.

39:42.510 --> 39:43.345
You okay?

39:45.107 --> 39:46.208
Yeah.

40:11.366 --> 40:12.435
Thank you.

40:15.670 --> 40:17.098
I was gonna tell you.

40:17.473 --> 40:18.741
That you and Anna broke up?

40:18.773 --> 40:20.717
- Yeah.
- What happened?

40:21.210 --> 40:23.378
Well, we were apart
more than we were together.

40:23.806 --> 40:25.581
Wow. That can be fixed.

40:25.614 --> 40:26.782
We're still better apart.

40:29.652 --> 40:30.753
It's a beautiful night.

40:31.154 --> 40:32.322
Yeah.

40:33.456 --> 40:35.658
But not as beautiful
as that night in Ibiza.

40:35.690 --> 40:37.826
Oh, but less scary.

40:37.860 --> 40:40.597
In my defense, it was Brooke's
idea to wedding crash.

40:44.599 --> 40:46.201
It's kind of chilly. Do
you wanna go back inside?

40:46.235 --> 40:47.737
No, I like it out here.

40:53.643 --> 40:54.711
Thank you.

41:07.290 --> 41:08.692
Um, sorry.

41:10.326 --> 41:11.829
Um...

41:12.228 --> 41:13.864
Oh, I have to take this, I'm sorry.

41:15.730 --> 41:17.299
Hey, Sam, is everything okay?
