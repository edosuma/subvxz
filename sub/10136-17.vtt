07:53.140 --> 07:54.766
Steph, I see where

07:53.140 --> 07:54.766
you get your looks.

07:54.808 --> 07:55.934
Well, thanks.

07:55.976 --> 08:00.105
Yeah, I didn't say<i> good</i> looks.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.066
Could we just do

08:00.147 --> 08:03.066
the assignment, okay?

08:03.108 --> 08:05.152
I can hardly wait.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.908
Maybe there isn't good

08:09.114 --> 08:11.908
in everybody.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.452
What a brat.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.536
Somebody needs to teach

08:13.493 --> 08:15.536
that kid manners.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.664
I wonder if he's got

08:15.578 --> 08:17.664
an older brother.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.212
Who's room is this?

08:24.254 --> 08:27.132
Rainbow Brite.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.010
Let's just do the assignment.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.304
Okay, what did you do

08:30.051 --> 08:32.304
today that was nice?

08:32.346 --> 08:36.475
Well, I didn't put bubble gum

08:32.346 --> 08:36.475
on anyone's chair.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.685
What a prince.

08:40.103 --> 08:42.189
Oh, Stephanie.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.899
Oh, look. It's half a person.

08:44.941 --> 08:48.111
You've got a bad attitude.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.779
What is it, Michelle?

08:48.153 --> 08:49.779
We're studying.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.240
You're in big trouble with dad.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.284
Big, big, big,

08:52.282 --> 08:54.284
big, big, big, big--

08:54.326 --> 08:57.620
Okay, okay. I get it.

08:54.326 --> 08:57.620
What did I do?

08:57.662 --> 09:00.915
You forgot to take

08:57.662 --> 09:00.915
the garbage out again.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.209
Uh-oh.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.752
Dad said he'll deal

09:02.250 --> 09:04.752
with you later.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.172
Just thought

09:04.794 --> 09:07.172
you'd like to know.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.885
Well, guess you're

09:09.049 --> 09:11.885
really in for it now, huh?

09:11.926 --> 09:14.095
Tsss. Yeah.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.095
That's twice this week.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.515
My dad's going

09:14.137 --> 09:16.515
to flip out on me.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.100
Well, you know what helps,

09:16.556 --> 09:19.100
try thinking of a funny movie

09:19.142 --> 09:21.478
like "Home alone"

09:19.142 --> 09:21.478
or "Roger Rabbit."

09:21.520 --> 09:23.730
That's what I always do

09:21.520 --> 09:23.730
when I'm getting it.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.106
Getting what?

09:25.148 --> 09:28.402
Well, you know, when

09:25.148 --> 09:28.402
your dad's pounding you.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.029
You mean, hitting?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.490
My dad never hits me.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.950
Does yours hit you?

09:35.992 --> 09:37.994
No. Just, just,

09:35.992 --> 09:37.994
just forget it.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.414
Let's do the assignment.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.874
But you said you always

09:40.455 --> 09:42.874
think of a funny movie.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.543
Do you get hit a lot?

09:44.584 --> 09:47.795
Look, I didn't mean anything

09:44.584 --> 09:47.795
by it, just forget it, okay?

09:47.837 --> 09:49.047
Let's do the assignment.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.383
Charles, you can

09:49.089 --> 09:51.383
trust me, I swear.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.885
No, I don't care if you swear

09:51.425 --> 09:53.885
on your mother's life.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.349
My mother is not alive.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.394
Oh. I'm sorry.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.525
Mine's not alive either.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.945
I'm sorry.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.905
Look, the thing is

10:13.947 --> 10:16.741
my dad does hit me sometimes

10:16.783 --> 10:20.703
but it's my own fault

10:16.783 --> 10:20.703
for ticking him off.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.873
Boy, did he clobber me

10:20.745 --> 10:23.873
last week.

10:23.915 --> 10:26.501
You mean, when you came to

10:23.915 --> 10:26.501
school with that black eye

10:26.543 --> 10:28.669
and you said you walked

10:26.543 --> 10:28.669
into a door?

10:28.711 --> 10:31.881
Yeah. A door named dad.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.092
Maybe you should tell someone.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.261
No. No!

10:36.303 --> 10:39.556
I can't tell anyone,

10:36.303 --> 10:39.556
and neither can you.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.559
- What time is it?

10:39.598 --> 10:42.559
- 5:30.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.352
I forgot to phone my dad and

10:42.601 --> 10:44.352
tell him I was gonna be late.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.396
He'll kill me.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.396
I got to go. I gotta go.

10:46.438 --> 10:47.397
But, Charles.

10:47.439 --> 10:50.150
Steph, you gotta swear to me.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.068
You can't tell anyone

10:50.191 --> 10:52.068
as long as you live.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.821
Ever, you got it, okay?

10:55.447 --> 10:57.616
Okay. I swear.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.721
Hi, Stephanie. New top?

11:20.763 --> 11:23.433
Yeah, like you said,

11:20.763 --> 11:23.433
"it's the latest style."

11:23.475 --> 11:25.268
But that was yesterday.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.521
Oh, haven't you heard?

11:27.562 --> 11:30.023
It's coming back

11:27.562 --> 11:30.023
again after lunch.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.400
- No way!

11:32.442 --> 11:34.402
Good morning, class.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.696
Stephanie, I'm afraid we're

11:34.444 --> 11:37.696
gonna have to find you

11:37.738 --> 11:39.574
another partner

11:37.738 --> 11:39.574
for your assignment.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.451
Why, I thought

11:39.616 --> 11:41.451
I working with Charles?

11:41.493 --> 11:43.828
Well, he's gonna be out all

11:41.493 --> 11:43.828
week. He had an accident.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.039
He<i> is</i> an accident.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.082
Hey, cut it out!

11:46.080 --> 11:48.082
That's not funny.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.708
Hey! Don't have freak attack.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.710
Alright, that's enough,

11:49.750 --> 11:51.710
let's take our seats.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.838
- Mrs. Patterson?

11:51.752 --> 11:53.838
- Yeah.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.383
What kind of accident

11:53.880 --> 11:56.383
did Charles have?

11:56.424 --> 11:59.927
Well, his father said

11:56.424 --> 11:59.927
he fell down the stairs.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.305
No.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.767
What is it, Stephanie?

12:06.809 --> 12:10.146
Um...nothing.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.703
Okay, who wants

12:21.740 --> 12:24.703
to hear another joke?

12:24.743 --> 12:26.454
- Oh!

12:26.496 --> 12:30.250
Oh, now, don't you have

12:26.496 --> 12:30.250
a sense of humor?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.919
Of course they do.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.919
Come on, you guys.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.629
Give the girls

12:32.960 --> 12:34.629
some encouragement.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.548
I mean, after all,

12:34.671 --> 12:36.548
they look up to you.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.841
Well, actually, they

12:36.590 --> 12:38.841
look up to everyone.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.178
Just laugh.

12:42.220 --> 12:45.014
Now, what's a frog's

12:42.220 --> 12:45.014
favorite drink?

12:45.056 --> 12:46.974
- I don't know.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.974
- What?

12:47.016 --> 12:50.019
Croak-a Cola.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.647
[laughing]

12:55.316 --> 12:57.360
That was a good one.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.655
Hey, Steph, you want

12:58.695 --> 13:00.655
to hear a joke?

13:00.697 --> 13:03.283
- Nah.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.283
- It's really funny.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.660
They laughed

13:03.324 --> 13:05.660
their heads off.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.246
I'm not really in

13:05.702 --> 13:08.246
the mood for a joke.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.290
Let's go tell

13:08.288 --> 13:10.290
Nicky and Alex.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.293
Yeah, they'll laugh

13:10.331 --> 13:13.293
at anything.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.254
Come on, Deej.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.254
Help me set the table.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.047
Alright, Steve, I've finished

13:16.296 --> 13:18.047
my half of this book

13:18.089 --> 13:19.215
for this

13:18.089 --> 13:19.215
Catcher In The Rye report, huh.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.425
Alright, no problem

13:20.467 --> 13:22.051
I finished my half.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.051
Hey, how was yours?

13:22.093 --> 13:25.263
My half wasn't, uh,

13:22.093 --> 13:25.263
wasn't half bad.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.641
Yeah, I gotta admit,

13:25.305 --> 13:27.641
I liked my half too.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.434
I'm dying to find

13:27.682 --> 13:29.434
out what happens.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.227
Yeah, I'm dying to find out what

13:29.476 --> 13:31.227
happens before it happened.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.020
- Lay it on me.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.020
- Okay, well.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.105
Um, first, you know

13:33.062 --> 13:34.105
that guy Holden?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.732
He gets kicked out of school.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.109
Oh, yeah, I noticed he had

13:35.774 --> 13:38.109
a lot of time on his hands.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.611
But I didn't know why.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.611
Good, okay.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.571
Okay, um,

13:39.653 --> 13:41.571
it was really funny.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.657
I was laughing out loud.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.577
Yeah?

13:45.032 --> 13:47.577
What was so funny?

13:47.619 --> 13:50.871
Oh! Well, you know, the

13:47.619 --> 13:50.871
characters were acting funny

13:50.913 --> 13:52.707
and saying all this funny stuff.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.001
- Right.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.001
- It was funny, man.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.257
First half of the book,

13:58.588 --> 14:01.257
"funny, man?"

14:01.299 --> 14:02.592
I'm, I'm, trying to explain it

14:02.634 --> 14:05.219
I just can't say it

14:02.634 --> 14:05.219
as good as he wrote it.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.554
You know guys this could be why

14:06.596 --> 14:08.556
most people read both

14:06.596 --> 14:08.556
halves of the book.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.890
Alright, this

14:08.598 --> 14:09.890
is ridiculous.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.892
I'm done with shortcuts.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.936
I'm gonna read the whole book.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.936
I missed a lot of good things

14:13.978 --> 14:15.772
Yeah, you know, it's like

14:13.978 --> 14:15.772
ordering a pizza

14:15.814 --> 14:18.525
and then stopping after

14:15.814 --> 14:18.525
only six slices.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.943
Yeah, like only

14:18.566 --> 14:20.943
seeing half a movie.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.570
I remember I walked

14:20.985 --> 14:22.570
into "Tootsie" late once

14:22.612 --> 14:23.822
and I kept saying to myself

14:23.863 --> 14:26.199
"Who's that ugly woman?"

14:26.240 --> 14:30.077
Come on. We got some

14:26.240 --> 14:30.077
reading to do.

14:30.119 --> 14:33.498
Hey, you know, in "Tootsie,"

14:30.119 --> 14:33.498
that was a guy.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.919
No, seriously, he

14:36.417 --> 14:38.919
was wearing a wig..

14:38.961 --> 14:41.047
You know, Deej, I think that

14:38.961 --> 14:41.047
your Uncle Jesse is gonna be

14:41.088 --> 14:43.257
a really positive

14:41.088 --> 14:43.257
influence on Steve.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.552
Yeah, and even if

14:43.299 --> 14:45.552
his grades don't improve

14:45.593 --> 14:47.679
his hair's gonna

14:45.593 --> 14:47.679
look great.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.598
Joey, look at this phone bill.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.851
$2.00, $6.00, $3.00.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.813
Danny, I have never called

14:52.892 --> 14:56.813
a 976 number in my life.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.233
Okay, once.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.693
I tried that dating service

15:01.735 --> 15:05.112
but I stopped after

15:01.735 --> 15:05.112
I got my Aunt Frieda.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.574
Joey, I'm not accusing you,

15:05.154 --> 15:07.574
I'm just asking you.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.034
But why I'm I always the one

15:07.615 --> 15:10.034
who gets asked, I mean

15:10.076 --> 15:11.661
somebody leaves cheese

15:10.076 --> 15:11.661
in the hamper

15:11.703 --> 15:13.705
right away, it's my fault.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.875
The gouda was in

15:13.747 --> 15:16.875
your pants.

15:16.916 --> 15:21.254
Ha. Like you never left a wedge

15:16.916 --> 15:21.254
of cheese in your pants.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.509
I'm just gonna call this number

15:23.130 --> 15:26.509
myself and see what it is.

15:26.551 --> 15:29.470
Does anybody want

15:26.551 --> 15:29.470
to hear another joke?

15:29.512 --> 15:33.474
How could you tell if there's a

15:29.512 --> 15:33.474
elephant's in the refrigerator?

15:33.516 --> 15:35.935
in the butter.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.691
How'd you know that?

15:41.733 --> 15:44.652
Your funny buddy

15:41.733 --> 15:44.652
just told me.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.321
- Uh-oh.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.321
- Ooh.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.699
You're busted.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.743
Joey, you were right.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.743
I'm sorry.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.953
Now, could you do me a favor

15:51.785 --> 15:53.953
and drive Denise home?

15:53.994 --> 15:55.204
'Cause I wanna talk to Michelle

15:55.246 --> 15:56.956
about her funny buddy

15:55.246 --> 15:56.956

15:56.997 --> 15:59.041
Certainly. But in this

Did you know these funny

16:15.475 --> 16:17.769
buddy calls cost money?

16:17.811 --> 16:20.104
- Yes, I did.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.104
- You did?

16:20.146 --> 16:22.941
Did you know that every call

16:20.146 --> 16:22.941
you make shows up on this bill?

16:22.982 --> 16:26.402
No, but I do wish

16:22.982 --> 16:26.402
somebody told me.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.321
So, you knew you

16:26.444 --> 16:28.321
were doing wrong

16:28.362 --> 16:30.114
but you still went

16:28.362 --> 16:30.114
ahead and did it.

16:30.156 --> 16:33.701
I'm really sorry, daddy,

16:30.156 --> 16:33.701
I'll never do it again.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.912
Hold it. Not so fast.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.294
I mean, come back here, please.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.966
You know, sometimes saying

16:45.839 --> 16:47.966
you're sorry is not enough.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.885
But sometimes it is.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.679
No, not this time, okay?

16:52.720 --> 16:54.722
Every night this week, you are

16:52.720 --> 16:54.722
gonna go to bed an hour earlier

16:54.764 --> 16:56.933
'cause I want you think

16:54.764 --> 16:56.933
about what you've done.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.267
But that's not fair.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.353
Well, I think it is fair,

16:58.309 --> 17:00.353
I want you upstairs.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.729
- But--

17:00.394 --> 17:01.729
- No, no "buts ."

17:01.771 --> 17:04.691
I want you upstairs pronto.

17:07.568 --> 17:11.948
[grumbling]

17:07.568 --> 17:11.948
I can't believe daddy's so mean.

17:07.568 --> 17:11.948
I cant do anything.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.078
I'm never talking

17:15.910 --> 17:18.078
to daddy again.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.747
He's a big meanie.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.708
Don't say that.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.126
He's making me

17:21.749 --> 17:24.126
go to bed early.

17:24.168 --> 17:25.294
Big deal.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.046
It is to me.

17:27.087 --> 17:30.758
Look, I'm telling you.

17:27.087 --> 17:30.758
Don't ever call dad names.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.635
You can't tell me what to do.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.388
Yes, I can.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.388
I'm your big sister.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.891
You're not that big.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.017
I'm bigger than you.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.142
- So?

17:40.184 --> 17:41.268
- So?

17:41.310 --> 17:43.021
- So?

17:43.062 --> 17:46.106
Hey, hey, hey, Itchy, Scratchy,

17:43.062 --> 17:46.106
what's going on?

17:46.148 --> 17:47.441
I'm trying to read out here.

17:47.483 --> 17:51.738
Michelle's saying terrible

17:47.483 --> 17:51.738
things about dad.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.531
Daddy punished me.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.950
Oh, now, Michelle, listen,

17:53.573 --> 17:55.950
your dad's a very fair man.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.076
If he punished you,

17:55.992 --> 17:57.076
I'm sure there

17:57.117 --> 17:58.411
must've been a good reason.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.371
Well, there is.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.582
But I still don't like it.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.294
- You hang in there, okay?

18:04.250 --> 18:07.294
- Okay.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.923
Come on, Comet.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.923
Watch me brush my teeth.

18:09.964 --> 18:13.342
It's almost my new bedtime.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.392
Big deal, so she has

18:18.890 --> 18:21.392
to go to bed early.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.311
Doesn't she know

18:21.434 --> 18:24.311
how lucky we are?

18:24.353 --> 18:27.481
Some kids get punished

18:24.353 --> 18:27.481
a lot worse than that.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.985
Stephanie, where's

18:27.523 --> 18:30.985
this coming from?

18:31.027 --> 18:35.073
Here. Sit down here.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.824
Is there something you

18:35.114 --> 18:36.824
want to talk about?

18:36.866 --> 18:38.367
Yeah.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.457
I can't hear you

18:42.121 --> 18:44.457
unless you speak up.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.126
I can't, I promised

18:44.498 --> 18:47.126
I wouldn't tell.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.128
And you guys taught me

18:47.167 --> 18:49.128
never to break a promise.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.880
Yes, that's a,

18:49.169 --> 18:50.880
that's a good rule

18:50.922 --> 18:54.092
but once in a while there are

18:50.922 --> 18:54.092
exceptions to every rule.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.969
- There are?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.969
- Yeah.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.386
Yeah, like that one about,

18:56.010 --> 18:57.386
you know

18:57.428 --> 18:58.763
not being able to swim

18:57.428 --> 18:58.763
after you eat.

18:58.805 --> 18:59.973
You know, you have

18:58.805 --> 18:59.973
to wait an hour.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.515
I hate that rule.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.517
I mean, sure it applies,

19:01.557 --> 19:03.517
say, you eat steak dinner.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.144
You have a steak, you have

19:03.559 --> 19:05.144
a nice baked potato

19:05.185 --> 19:06.813
some sour cream,

19:05.185 --> 19:06.813
then yes, an hour.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.023
But say you eat a cracker,

19:06.854 --> 19:09.023
see this makes no sense.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.109
Here's where the exception

19:09.065 --> 19:11.109
comes in. You eat a cracker

19:11.150 --> 19:13.486
I say boom, five minutes,

19:11.150 --> 19:13.486
ba-da-bing, you're in the pool.

19:13.527 --> 19:16.363
Right? A peanut, I say, eat the

19:13.527 --> 19:16.363
peanut and swim, who cares

19:16.405 --> 19:19.158
right? There's all these excep..

19:16.405 --> 19:19.158
A plethora of exceptions here.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.368
Uncle Jesse,

19:19.199 --> 19:21.368
I don't think this

19:21.410 --> 19:23.579
is that kind of exception.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.039
Well, look, Step,

19:23.621 --> 19:25.039
you're a very smart kid.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.792
Just use your common sense.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.962
If I tell you, can we

19:27.834 --> 19:30.962
just keep it between us?

19:31.004 --> 19:32.839
Well, I can't promise that

19:32.880 --> 19:35.215
unless I know what

19:32.880 --> 19:35.215
the secret is.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.885
That's what I should've said.

19:37.927 --> 19:41.722
Okay, There's this kid

19:37.927 --> 19:41.722
in my class, Charles.

19:41.764 --> 19:45.768
His father hits him. Bad.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.728
He really hurts him,

19:45.810 --> 19:47.728
Uncle Jesse.

19:47.770 --> 19:51.107
- Are you sure, Steph?

19:47.770 --> 19:51.107
- Positive.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.442
He told me all about it.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.695
And he wasn't in school today.

19:55.736 --> 19:59.198
The teacher said he

19:55.736 --> 19:59.198
had another "accident."

19:59.239 --> 20:00.449
Oh, I gotta report this

19:59.239 --> 20:00.449
right now.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.076
- Why?

20:00.491 --> 20:02.076
- Because..

20:02.118 --> 20:04.537
...if I don't, I'm gonna

20:02.118 --> 20:04.537
straighten him out myself.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.622
No, Uncle Jesse. Please.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.709
I swore I wouldn't tell.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.046
Listen, sweetheart

20:13.087 --> 20:15.214
I know you want

20:13.087 --> 20:15.214
to keep your promise.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.841
But if you know

20:15.255 --> 20:16.841
this is happening

20:16.883 --> 20:19.052
and you don't say

20:16.883 --> 20:19.052
anything about it

20:19.093 --> 20:22.471
you're only helping it

20:19.093 --> 20:22.471
happen again.

20:22.513 --> 20:26.350
But what'll happen to Charles

20:22.513 --> 20:26.350
if we report it?

20:26.392 --> 20:29.854
What'll happen to Charles

20:26.392 --> 20:29.854
if we don't?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.117
Steph, I'm glad

20:41.240 --> 20:43.117
you're home.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.578
Listen, I wanna

20:43.159 --> 20:45.578
to talk to you

20:45.619 --> 20:47.914
about your pal

20:45.619 --> 20:47.914
Charles, okay?

20:47.955 --> 20:51.084
It's been a week and

20:47.955 --> 20:51.084
he's still not in school.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.585
I'm worried about him.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.921
I know. Listen, um..

20:54.962 --> 20:56.380
...I made some calls today.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.842
And The Child Welfare

20:56.422 --> 20:59.842
people, um..

20:59.884 --> 21:02.344
...they took Charles, and they

20:59.884 --> 21:02.344
put him in a foster family.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.723
They took him away

21:03.345 --> 21:05.723
from his home?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.350
I never should've told you.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.350
now he's gonna hate me.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.019
This is all your fault.

21:10.061 --> 21:12.063
Stephanie, knock it off.

21:10.061 --> 21:12.063
Stephanie, listen.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.564
It's not my fault.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.564
It's not your fault.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.191
We weren't the ones

21:13.606 --> 21:15.191
hurting Charles.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.110
Then why they had to take

21:15.233 --> 21:17.110
him out of his house?

21:17.151 --> 21:19.237
They had to,

21:17.151 --> 21:19.237
he wasn't safe there.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.529
What's gonna happen to Charles?

21:20.571 --> 21:22.322
Well, Charles and

21:20.571 --> 21:22.322
his father need help.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.075
And now they're gonna get it.

21:24.117 --> 21:27.120
Sweetheart, please believe me,

21:24.117 --> 21:27.120
you did the right thing.

21:27.161 --> 21:30.873
Then why do I feel so lousy?

21:30.915 --> 21:33.542
'Cause it's a lousy

21:30.915 --> 21:33.542
situation, kid.

21:36.212 --> 21:37.922
But, listen

21:37.964 --> 21:40.382
I realize how hard

21:37.964 --> 21:40.382
this was for you.

21:40.424 --> 21:43.094
But the bottom line

21:40.424 --> 21:43.094
is thanks to you

21:43.136 --> 21:45.096
thanks to Stephanie

21:45.138 --> 21:48.015
Charles' father

21:45.138 --> 21:48.015
can't hurt him tonight.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.517
What made his

21:48.057 --> 21:50.517
father so mean?

21:52.561 --> 21:54.563
I don't know.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.523
I look at you girls

21:56.565 --> 22:00.027
and I look at Nicky and Alex..

22:00.069 --> 22:02.155
...how can anyone

22:00.069 --> 22:02.155
hurt their child?

22:05.992 --> 22:08.161
Dad just pulled in.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.161
It's time for dinner.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.790
Let's go eat.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.128
Okay, everybody,

22:15.084 --> 22:17.128
I got pizzas.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.672
Eat them while they're hot.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.799
(Joey)

22:19.713 --> 22:21.799
'Pass it around.'

22:25.886 --> 22:27.930
Thanks.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.930
What was that for?

22:27.972 --> 22:30.516
Nothing.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.516
I just felt like it.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.977
I'll take a free hug anytime.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.691
Okay, here we go.
