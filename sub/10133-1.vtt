And I'm wet.

08:54.493 --> 08:57.829
(Danny)

08:54.493 --> 08:57.829
'The clipboard of fun says

08:54.493 --> 08:57.829
today, I get to be the skipper.'

09:01.666 --> 09:04.294
(D.J.)

09:01.666 --> 09:04.294
'Skipper, we've been out here

09:01.666 --> 09:04.294
for hours.'

09:04.336 --> 09:07.381
(Jesse)

09:04.336 --> 09:07.381
'Danny, do you even

09:04.336 --> 09:07.381
have a clue where we are?'

09:07.422 --> 09:10.591
Ahoy, mateys.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.591
Gather round ye skipper.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.677
Aye aye, skipper.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.846
According to my map,

09:12.719 --> 09:14.846
we should be arriving any minute

09:14.888 --> 09:16.390
at the beautiful island of Pua

09:16.431 --> 09:19.226
for a picnic on the beach,

09:16.431 --> 09:19.226
and a Polynesian show.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.644
- Which island?

09:19.267 --> 09:21.644
- This island.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.734
- Hey, where did the island go?

09:23.480 --> 09:27.734
- It's on your finger, dad.

09:27.775 --> 09:31.071
Ahoy, mateys, your skipper's

09:27.775 --> 09:31.071
been sailing all morning

09:31.112 --> 09:33.407
to a potato chip crumb.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.534
- Oh!

09:33.448 --> 09:35.534
- Great.

09:35.575 --> 09:39.037
- Dad, are we lost?

09:35.575 --> 09:39.037
- Of course not.

09:39.079 --> 09:44.292
[chuckles]

09:39.079 --> 09:44.292
We're exactly, uh,

09:39.079 --> 09:44.292
two hours and 46 minutes due..

09:44.334 --> 09:46.002
...this way of our hotel.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.128
Look, an island.

09:47.170 --> 09:50.673
Alright, you see.

09:47.170 --> 09:50.673
I told you.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.801
Skipper, exactly

09:50.715 --> 09:53.801
where is that island on the map?

09:53.843 --> 09:55.678
Well, it's right..

09:56.971 --> 09:59.849
Uh, it's, uh, one of those.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.525
(Danny)

10:05.105 --> 10:08.525
What a beautiful beach.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.525
Anybody find anything?

10:08.567 --> 10:10.402
(Rebecca)

10:08.567 --> 10:10.402
Nothing up the beach.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.279
There's nothing down the beach.

10:12.320 --> 10:16.491
I haven't seen one sign

10:12.320 --> 10:16.491
of intelligent life, skipper.

10:16.533 --> 10:20.203
Whoa-ho! Island crankiness.

10:16.533 --> 10:20.203
Look, nobody panic.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.539
Let's just go back to where

10:20.245 --> 10:22.539
your skipper tied up the boat.

10:22.581 --> 10:25.292
I'll simply radio the coast

10:22.581 --> 10:25.292
guard and tell him our location

10:25.333 --> 10:28.503
and they'll guide us to Pua.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.503
Okay? Now follow me.

10:30.505 --> 10:34.175
- Aye aye, skipper.

10:30.505 --> 10:34.175
- Michelle, don't encourage him.

10:36.010 --> 10:39.055
(Danny)

10:36.010 --> 10:39.055
Okay, guys, we're gonna

10:36.010 --> 10:39.055
have our picnic on the boat.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.765
Now, if the trade winds

10:39.097 --> 10:40.765
are favorable

10:40.807 --> 10:43.059
we can still make

10:40.807 --> 10:43.059
the Polynesian show.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.520
Of course, if we're late,

10:43.101 --> 10:45.520
this could spell disaster

10:45.562 --> 10:47.481
for the clipboard of fun.

10:47.522 --> 10:50.024
- Bye-bye, boat.

10:47.522 --> 10:50.024
- How cute.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.820
Michelle's waving bye-bye to...

10:50.066 --> 10:53.820
our boat!

10:53.861 --> 10:56.739
Oh, D.J., don't be silly,

10:53.861 --> 10:56.739
I tied up our boat right..

10:59.534 --> 11:01.578
...there!

10:59.534 --> 11:01.578
It is our boat.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.955
- Come back!

11:01.620 --> 11:03.955
- Hurry, dad.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.124
Jesse, you'll never catch

11:03.997 --> 11:06.124
that boat!

11:06.166 --> 11:09.127
I don't wanna catch the boat.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.127
I wanna catch Danny.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.299
(Jesse)

11:12.880 --> 11:14.299
Come back here.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.888
(Danny)

11:18.719 --> 11:20.888
'Jesse, leave me alone.'

11:20.930 --> 11:24.142
Come over here, skipper.

11:24.184 --> 11:28.480
- Not until you calm down.

11:24.184 --> 11:28.480
- Fine. Alright. Fine.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.690
I'm calm. I'm cool.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.690
I'm not gonna hurt you.

11:31.732 --> 11:35.153
- I just wanna talk to you.

11:31.732 --> 11:35.153
- That's better.

11:35.195 --> 11:39.782
First thing I'd like to say is

11:35.195 --> 11:39.782
I hate this clipboard of fun.

11:39.824 --> 11:43.495
How can a person lose a boat?

11:43.537 --> 11:45.413
It's not my fault.

11:45.455 --> 11:48.458
The rope must have slipped off

11:45.455 --> 11:48.458
the rope thingy.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.503
The rope thingy, skipper?

11:51.545 --> 11:53.296
We're stuck.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.296
What are we gonna do?

11:53.338 --> 11:55.131
Well, if we were

11:53.338 --> 11:55.131
on Gilligan's Island

11:55.173 --> 11:58.051
the professor would make

11:55.173 --> 11:58.051
a radio out of coconuts.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.429
Joseph, it's no time for comedy.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.429
It's time to blame Danny.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.349
Relax, Jess, we have the rest

12:01.471 --> 12:04.349
of our lives to blame Danny.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.393
Right now, we need to keep

12:04.391 --> 12:06.393
things light and easy

12:06.434 --> 12:08.811
so the girls don't get scared.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.564
So I don't get scared.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.108
Are we in really big trouble?

12:14.150 --> 12:16.444
(together)

12:14.150 --> 12:16.444
No.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.989
If we believe in the Menehunes,

12:16.486 --> 12:19.989
they will come and help us.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.409
And then, we'll live happily

12:20.031 --> 12:22.409
ever after.

12:22.450 --> 12:26.538
Seven year olds.

12:22.450 --> 12:26.538
Aren't they adorable?

12:26.580 --> 12:29.123
Don't ever pet me.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.750
Oh, we better start looking

12:29.165 --> 12:31.750
for food, shelter, water

12:31.792 --> 12:34.254
and some Krazy Glue 'cause

12:31.792 --> 12:34.254
I know I'm gonna break a nail.

12:34.295 --> 12:37.591
- Alright.

12:34.295 --> 12:37.591
- Hey, what the heck is this?

12:39.467 --> 12:43.513
The clipboard comes back

12:39.467 --> 12:43.513
but the boat keeps goin'.

12:43.555 --> 12:46.015
Come on, let's go to work.

12:43.555 --> 12:46.015
We got a lot to do, you guys.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.268
- Come on, let's go.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.268
- Okay.

12:50.562 --> 12:53.565
Well, I hate to say it, Michelle

12:53.607 --> 12:56.276
but the old skipper

12:53.607 --> 12:56.276
really goofed up big time.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.612
It's okay, skipper.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.821
Oh, thanks, little buddy.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.743
[Joey imitating Popeye]

13:04.783 --> 13:08.496
Oh, a nice little coconut here,

13:04.783 --> 13:08.496
a nice little one here..

13:08.538 --> 13:10.373
Oh, boy, gosh..

13:10.415 --> 13:13.334
Let's see here, huh?

13:10.415 --> 13:13.334
Here goes..

13:17.922 --> 13:19.257
Oh, gosh!

13:21.175 --> 13:23.762
[instrumental music]

13:24.971 --> 13:26.723
Oh, wow!

13:26.765 --> 13:28.683
Joey.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.351
Oh, yes!

13:36.608 --> 13:37.984
Oh, gosh.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.818
Seein' girls out in the water.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.238
Gettin' conked on the noggin

13:39.860 --> 13:42.238
with a coconut.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.865
I'll bet you Bluto's got

13:42.280 --> 13:44.865
somethin' to do with this, ooh.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.119
Alright, fresh water.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.996
A lot of fresh water.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.830
It's beautiful.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.833
Jesse, this is so romantic.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.461
Kiss me.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.301
That's "Paradise,

14:01.174 --> 14:03.301
Hawaiian Style," little momma.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.011
Jesse, we're finally alone

14:05.052 --> 14:07.930
and you're still talking

14:05.052 --> 14:07.930
about Elvis. Enough.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.557
What's the matter?

14:07.972 --> 14:09.557
You got a problem with the King?

14:09.599 --> 14:12.310
The King made the exact

14:09.599 --> 14:12.310
same movie 33 times.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.813
The only thing that changed

14:12.352 --> 14:14.813
were those stupid sideburns.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.527
Hold it a second,

14:18.191 --> 14:20.527
are you trying to tell me

14:20.568 --> 14:22.696
that you have a problem

14:20.568 --> 14:22.696
with Elvis' sideburns?

14:22.737 --> 14:25.323
Yes, I believe

14:22.737 --> 14:25.323
that's what I just said.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.784
Well, well, well,

14:25.365 --> 14:27.784
after all these months

14:27.826 --> 14:30.745
the truth finally comes out.

14:27.826 --> 14:30.745
You hate Elvis Presley.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.414
Oh, no, not at first,

14:30.787 --> 14:33.414
but you pushed me too far.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.041
You know what your problem is?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.041
You're jealous.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.959
You're jealous 'cause Elvis

14:35.082 --> 14:36.959
has better hair than you do.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.712
- Better hair?

14:37.001 --> 14:38.712
- Yeah, check a mirror.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.254
- Oh, you know what?

14:38.753 --> 14:40.254
- What?

14:40.296 --> 14:41.798
I don't have to stand here

14:40.296 --> 14:41.798
and listen to this.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.467
Hey, I'm talkin' to you. Becky!

14:44.509 --> 14:47.178
[shouting]

14:44.509 --> 14:47.178
Becky!

14:55.936 --> 14:58.523
[indistinct]

15:03.737 --> 15:06.823
Look, Mr. Bear, orange things.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.033
You taste them first.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.243
[both screaming]

15:10.284 --> 15:12.161
Menehune.

15:12.203 --> 15:13.538
Menehune.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.373
D.J.! D.J.!

15:15.415 --> 15:18.918
Wait a minute.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.918
I caught a..

15:18.959 --> 15:20.837
...clipboard of fun.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.091
(Stephanie)

15:22.171 --> 15:25.091
'D.J., come here.'

15:25.132 --> 15:26.926
I saw, we screamed..

15:26.967 --> 15:30.054
I need...to catch...my breath.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.390
Okay. I'm ready.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.770
We're saved. I saw a Menehune.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.770
I do believe. I do  believe.

15:36.811 --> 15:40.106
I do believe you've been

15:36.811 --> 15:40.106
in the sun way too long.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.108
How rude.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.694
It wasn't just me.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.694
Mr. Bear saw him too.

15:44.736 --> 15:48.155
Steph, your only witness

15:44.736 --> 15:48.155
has buttons for eyeballs.

15:48.197 --> 15:52.326
Trust me,

15:48.197 --> 15:52.326
there are no Menehunes.

15:52.368 --> 15:56.915
Well, if that's true,

15:52.368 --> 15:56.915
then what's gonna happen to us?

15:56.956 --> 16:01.419
We have no house,

15:56.956 --> 16:01.419
or a bed, or a phone.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.130
We can't even call out

16:01.461 --> 16:04.130
for pizza.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.006
We're doomed.

16:06.048 --> 16:09.093
We're not doomed,

16:06.048 --> 16:09.093
dad, Uncle Jesse and Uncle Joey

16:09.135 --> 16:11.721
would never let

16:09.135 --> 16:11.721
anything happen to us.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.223
They have everything

16:11.763 --> 16:14.223
under control.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.392
- Are you sure?

16:14.265 --> 16:16.392
- I'm sure.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.478
There's nothing to worry about.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.104
Thanks, Deej.

16:26.903 --> 16:31.073
- Danny, what are you doing?

16:26.903 --> 16:31.073
- This island is a pigsty.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.952
Daddy, the plane, the plane.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.496
[plane droning]

16:36.537 --> 16:38.623
(both)

16:36.537 --> 16:38.623
The plane! The plane!

16:38.665 --> 16:41.876
(all)

16:38.665 --> 16:41.876
Help! Help! Over here!

16:41.918 --> 16:44.295
Help! Over here! Help!

16:44.337 --> 16:47.173
(Jesse)

16:44.337 --> 16:47.173
'They can't hear us.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.173
They're gone.'

16:47.214 --> 16:50.176
We're gonna be stranded

16:47.214 --> 16:50.176
on this island forever.

16:50.217 --> 16:54.555
Oh, and I suppose that's

16:50.217 --> 16:54.555
my fault? Don't answer that.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.391
I'll answer it.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.391
Of course, it's your fault.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.311
I'd say we leave you

16:57.433 --> 17:00.311
and start our own tribe.
