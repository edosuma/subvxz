came down here for is...</i>

08:04.784 --> 08:07.150
<i>You know, engineering
your lifeguard stand</i>

08:07.220 --> 08:08.949
is an important business.

08:09.021 --> 08:11.785
You have got to figure
your angles just right.

08:11.858 --> 08:14.827
<i>Course, I won't always be
fixin' things around here.</i>

08:14.894 --> 08:17.988
One day I will be
a full-fledged counselor.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.931
I have learned all the steps
in the path of the brave,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.161
I have memorized
the handbook,

08:23.236 --> 08:27.002
<i>and I learned
the Kikakee sign language.</i>

08:27.073 --> 08:30.474
If only they'd give a fella
a chance.

08:30.543 --> 08:33.010
I'm sure they will,
Ernest.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.511
Nuh-uh.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.548
But the real reason
I'm here

08:36.616 --> 08:39.346
is to see if you've gotten
all your shots.

08:39.418 --> 08:40.679
[Chuckles]

08:40.753 --> 08:42.015

Okay.

08:46.926 --> 08:49.053
How's that grandfather
of yours nowadays?

08:49.128 --> 08:50.891
I haven't seen him around
lately.

08:50.963 --> 08:52.555
Oh, he's out at his place.

08:52.632 --> 08:56.124
I worry about him sometimes.
He's so old.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.262
But these woods are
his home.

08:59.338 --> 09:02.205
Yeah, he's a wise man.
[Chuckles]

09:02.275 --> 09:05.176

modern things like... shots.

09:05.244 --> 09:06.336
[Chuckles]

09:06.412 --> 09:07.504
That's right.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.242
He lives by the old ways.

09:10.316 --> 09:13.911
In fact, he thinks I'm
wasting time studying medicine.

09:13.986 --> 09:16.011
Shouldn't you, uh,
have a little more practice

09:16.088 --> 09:18.181
before you go around
stickin' needles in people?

09:18.257 --> 09:21.021
[Chuckles]
I've had lots of practice.

09:21.093 --> 09:25.029
If I keep doing it,
I might even get good at it.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.271
You know this isn't
going to hurt...

09:38.344 --> 09:40.312
much.

09:40.379 --> 09:42.745
I can take it,
Miss St. Cloud.

09:42.815 --> 09:45.875

and I'm a real man...

a stout back...

09:50.089 --> 09:53.650

and nails in his knuckles,

10:13.746 --> 10:16.237

by the governor's staff

10:16.315 --> 10:19.478
to take part in his, uh, program
for disadvantaged youngsters.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.679
He calls it, uh,
"Operation: Second Chance. "

10:21.754 --> 10:23.745
Some camps have
all the luck.

10:23.823 --> 10:28.157
And I just got notification that the second-chancers
are gonna be ready to be picked up today,

10:28.227 --> 10:29.888
and I wanted you guys
to be prepared for it.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.020
Better hide
your wallets.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.065
Yeah, and get out
your brass knuckles.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.259
We're already short-handed. How are
we gonna handle those delinquents?

10:35.334 --> 10:37.131
Oh, they're not
delinquents.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.967
They're just boys from a bit
rougher environment than most of us.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.506
You mean
underage criminals.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.132
No, they're not.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.643
They're all residents of
the State Institute For Boys,

10:45.711 --> 10:47.178
but they're not criminals.

10:47.246 --> 10:49.510
Stennis, I'm gonna let you
be their counselor.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.516
Why do I get stuck
with them?

10:51.584 --> 10:53.381
Because you've got
the most experience.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.215
Besides, after you get
to know those boys...

10:55.287 --> 10:57.016
Oh, I'm not gonna take
any crap off of them.

10:57.089 --> 10:59.023

I'm gonna knock 'em back in.

choice. We'll have to send them back.</i>

11:06.732 --> 11:09.462
Oh, I can handle 'em
all right.

11:09.535 --> 11:13.801
Yeah, a little discipline is
probably just what they need.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.534
<i>Uh, Ernest,
will you take the bus over</i>

11:15.608 --> 11:17.200
<i>and get those

He's been in and out

46:43.600 --> 46:46.694
It looks like a skeleton

47:00.217 --> 47:02.048
I wonder
what that could be.

47:02.119 --> 47:04.087
I bet they don't have
anything.

47:04.154 --> 47:06.418
- We do too!
- Oh, sure you do.

Do you think

48:13.824 --> 48:15.655
we could stay here forever

48:15.726 --> 48:19.059

he heard it,

50:28.225 --> 50:31.126
and that's when Vernon
turned around

50:31.194 --> 50:33.719

went out to get in his car,</i>

on the rearview mirror,

to be on the door handle.

- Yeah.</i>

50:56.286 --> 50:57.548
Yeah, it was originally,

on the rearview mirror,

if we just send them all
back to the institution,

that'll be three chances,
