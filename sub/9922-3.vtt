WEBVTT

02:38.238 --> 02:39.614
I love you.

02:44.494 --> 02:46.121
As long as
I can remember,

02:47.080 --> 02:48.498
I have desired you,

02:49.916 --> 02:53.128
and although I thought
it was power that I wanted,

02:53.378 --> 02:54.879
it's not true.

02:55.839 --> 02:59.384
All I ever really
wanted was you.

03:02.679 --> 03:04.973
And seeing that you
are still young enough,

03:05.181 --> 03:07.392
I hope and I dream

03:08.393 --> 03:10.395
that we can have
a child together.

03:12.647 --> 03:15.150
Then my happiness
would be complete.

03:30.248 --> 03:31.791
I need to piss.

03:59.235 --> 04:01.571
Bjorn Lothbrok
has left Kattegat.

04:01.821 --> 04:04.115
He is living alone in
a hut in the interior.

04:05.158 --> 04:08.453
It would be
a perfect opportunity
to assassinate him.

04:14.459 --> 04:18.213
I thought we came together
to destroy the family
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

04:19.047 --> 04:22.132
I thought that was your
ambition, as it is mine.

04:23.218 --> 04:26.596
For me, I will not rest
until my father's death
is avenged.

04:29.057 --> 04:30.308
I agree.

04:30.934 --> 04:32.560
It is the perfect
opportunity.

04:33.478 --> 04:35.313
And I also know
the perfect man for the job.

04:35.897 --> 04:36.981
A Berserker.

04:50.537 --> 04:51.830
What are you doing?

05:00.672 --> 05:02.507
I felt bad
for a long time

05:03.800 --> 05:05.802
for treating you so badly...

05:10.014 --> 05:13.143
Because of what happened
between you and Bjorn.

05:16.521 --> 05:19.440
I want to say that
I have forgiven you.

05:19.983 --> 05:22.193
It doesn't matter
to me at all.

05:23.528 --> 05:25.363
And I want to
return this to you.

05:34.497 --> 05:36.249
Thank you, Erlendur.

05:39.043 --> 05:42.088
You see,
you can be forgiving
if you want to be.

07:41.332 --> 07:42.750
Helga.

07:44.669 --> 07:47.213
Helga! Helga! Helga!

07:49.674 --> 07:50.675
Helga.

08:11.112 --> 08:12.322
I'm sorry.

08:13.531 --> 08:15.158
I'm sorry, Helga.

08:16.993 --> 08:18.328
I'm sorry.

08:18.536 --> 08:20.163
So am I.

08:20.955 --> 08:23.708
Believe me, so am I.

08:51.361 --> 08:53.029
May the gods
go with you, my friend.

08:53.237 --> 08:55.323
And may you enjoy yourself.

08:56.616 --> 08:58.576
Here is some protection.

08:58.701 --> 09:00.244
This was my father's ring.

09:00.411 --> 09:03.539
If anyone stops you,
you say you wear
the ring of King Horik,

09:03.623 --> 09:06.292
fashioned for him
by the magic
boat builder, Floki.

09:06.959 --> 09:08.378
All men will let you pass,

09:09.045 --> 09:11.130
until you reach
your destination.

09:15.218 --> 09:16.719
There will also
be gold and silver

09:16.803 --> 09:18.179
waiting for you
when you return,

09:18.262 --> 09:20.139
if you have succeeded.

09:21.224 --> 09:23.017
However you do it,

09:23.810 --> 09:25.853
kill Bjorn Ironside.

11:14.545 --> 11:15.963
St. Eulalia.

11:16.797 --> 11:18.841
St. Eulalia.

11:35.274 --> 11:36.442
Forgive me, Father.

11:37.944 --> 11:39.570
What about, my daughter?

11:39.654 --> 11:42.406
St. Eulalia.
Why was she sainted?

11:43.074 --> 11:47.453
Eulalia was martyred
by the pagan Roman
Emperor Maximian.

11:48.579 --> 11:51.415
She refused to renounce
her Christian faith

11:51.749 --> 11:54.293
and was sentenced
to be burned at the stake.

11:54.919 --> 11:56.921
But the flames
did not burn her.

11:57.672 --> 11:59.924
She was left alive
in the pyre,

12:00.466 --> 12:02.593
her flesh
totally untouched.

12:02.843 --> 12:04.136
And what did they do to her?

12:08.057 --> 12:13.437
My sweet daughter asked
what happened to Eulalia.

12:14.647 --> 12:16.274
She was beheaded.

12:18.651 --> 12:20.945
Her naked body was
thrown into the Forum.

12:21.195 --> 12:26.284
However, God sent
a blanket of snow to
protect her modesty.

12:26.826 --> 12:32.373
And she ascended to heaven
in the form of a dove.

12:35.126 --> 12:38.462
My husband is just like
that pagan Emperor.

12:39.130 --> 12:41.465
He'd probably like
to destroy me
in the same way,

12:41.549 --> 12:44.468
by burning me alive,
or cutting off my head.

12:51.976 --> 12:53.144
Woman.

12:54.645 --> 12:56.522
My woman...
Don't touch me!

12:57.607 --> 12:59.942
Don't ever touch me,
you ignorant savage!

13:01.068 --> 13:03.154
I will never
be your woman.

13:11.662 --> 13:13.873
I want a divorce.
Arrange it.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.543
Fill the Duke's glass.

13:18.336 --> 13:19.587
Let us be calm.

13:38.189 --> 13:40.358
What are we to do,
Count Odo?

13:40.441 --> 13:42.068
We have to stop
him leaving.

13:42.485 --> 13:44.528
If he leaves now,
it will be catastrophic

13:44.612 --> 13:47.323
for our attempts
to defend the city
against his brother.

13:47.823 --> 13:49.033
Try and tell him.

14:25.611 --> 14:26.987
Your Grace?

14:30.116 --> 14:31.200
Now.

14:38.457 --> 14:39.625
Paris.

14:40.710 --> 14:42.920
Me and you.

14:43.671 --> 14:44.714
Together.

14:45.297 --> 14:47.049
Can you understand?

14:54.849 --> 14:55.850
Uh...

15:13.743 --> 15:15.369
I understand!

15:15.953 --> 15:17.079
You want to learn!

15:17.455 --> 15:19.665
You want to speak
our language.

15:21.417 --> 15:22.460
Trust me.

15:24.795 --> 15:26.672
I will find you a teacher.

15:27.548 --> 15:30.384
Soon we will talk.

15:46.984 --> 15:48.152
Well?

15:49.278 --> 15:50.362
He will stay.

15:52.364 --> 15:53.699
Thank God.

15:58.245 --> 15:59.455
Drink.

16:00.456 --> 16:01.665
More!

16:28.901 --> 16:31.153
You haven't told him,
have you?

16:38.619 --> 16:40.496
He needs to know, Helga.

17:00.224 --> 17:02.393
What is he talking
about, Helga?

17:06.896 --> 17:09.148
What is it you
haven't told me?

17:10.776 --> 17:13.487
Our daughter is dead.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.700
She caught a fever.

17:18.325 --> 17:20.578
There was nothing
I could do.

18:07.124 --> 18:08.292
Shit.

18:11.629 --> 18:12.796
Bear.

18:27.811 --> 18:29.313
Where are you?

18:36.153 --> 18:37.738
Ready!
The shields up!

18:37.905 --> 18:39.073
That's it! One!

18:41.867 --> 18:44.536
I shall introduce you
to the making of pigments

18:44.620 --> 18:46.872
used to illuminate
Holy Scripture.

18:48.248 --> 18:50.584
These pigments,
or colors,

18:50.668 --> 18:53.879
come from various sources
of animals, plants,

18:53.962 --> 18:55.756
and natural minerals.

18:55.839 --> 18:58.592
The illuminator must be
a skilled chemist

18:58.676 --> 19:00.260
as well as an artist.

19:01.637 --> 19:03.764
These ingredients,
carefully mixed,

19:04.181 --> 19:08.227
form the basis of
many of the colors
we use in illumination.

19:08.686 --> 19:10.145
Some are poisonous

19:11.063 --> 19:13.357
and some are very rare,

19:14.149 --> 19:17.736
but those found
in the earth are common

19:18.070 --> 19:20.030
if you know
what to look for.

19:21.365 --> 19:23.200
Today, I would like
to show you

19:23.283 --> 19:25.369
how to make the color
known as vermillion.

19:26.286 --> 19:30.874
Vermillion is formed
from this mineral,
known as cinnabar,

19:31.834 --> 19:34.128
the principal ore
of mercury.

19:34.545 --> 19:35.796
To form the dye,

19:36.714 --> 19:41.844
we mix various
proportions of cinnabar

19:43.554 --> 19:45.013
and sulfur

19:46.390 --> 19:49.101
into a well-sealed jar.

19:51.186 --> 19:53.564
Then place the jar over heat

19:54.273 --> 19:57.067
until a blue vapor
is emitted.

19:57.526 --> 19:59.987
Prudentius,
you are a Frank.

20:00.946 --> 20:04.908
Tell me what you know
about the recent attack
on Paris by the Northmen.

20:06.702 --> 20:08.912
You have heard
about it, I assume?

20:09.705 --> 20:11.790
Who has not
heard about it?

20:12.124 --> 20:15.002
It is a cause celebre
across the whole of Europe.

20:15.085 --> 20:16.420
The city was besieged?

20:16.503 --> 20:18.672
Exactly.
She was besieged.

20:19.757 --> 20:21.884
Assailed from
every quarter.

20:22.718 --> 20:25.929
God knows how those
poor Christian
people suffered.

20:26.555 --> 20:28.599
But they triumphed?

20:28.974 --> 20:30.309
Of course.

20:30.684 --> 20:32.561
God was on their side.

20:33.812 --> 20:37.608
I have already heard
many details of the siege

20:38.108 --> 20:41.904
and the consequences
from the Abbot of the
monastery of St. Denis.

20:42.446 --> 20:45.407
It turns out that
many of the pagans

20:45.657 --> 20:47.659
who entered the
Cathedral of Notre Dame

20:48.243 --> 20:50.871
afterwards were
struck down by disease.

20:51.079 --> 20:54.875
Did the Abbot know the
identity of the Northmen
who attacked the city?

20:58.128 --> 21:02.591
Their leader was
the famous Viking,
Ragnar Lothbrok,

21:03.050 --> 21:04.343
wrath of God,

21:05.260 --> 21:08.889
who even pretended to be dead
to get inside the walls.

21:09.973 --> 21:13.143
But probably now is really
dead for his impiety.

21:15.103 --> 21:18.982
Was there any mention
of an English monk
called Athelstan,

21:20.150 --> 21:23.237
who might have been fighting
with Ragnar's band?

21:23.487 --> 21:24.822
A Christian?

21:25.155 --> 21:29.243
If it is true,
he should be caught
and crucified.

21:35.791 --> 21:38.043
Glair, for adhesion.

22:10.534 --> 22:13.036
Pretending to be dead.

22:14.538 --> 22:16.540
How like our Ragnar.

22:16.623 --> 22:19.960
You cannot fault his
ingenuity, as always.

22:20.752 --> 22:23.213
He has no news
of our Athelstan.

22:25.591 --> 22:28.176
He told me many of the
attackers fell sick

22:28.260 --> 22:31.179
and died after
entering the Cathedral.

22:32.014 --> 22:34.141
Our friend Athelstan
lives on,

22:34.224 --> 22:37.519
both in Alfred
and in you, Judith.

22:38.353 --> 22:42.941
God's sacred vessel,
chosen to deliver
the holy man's child.

22:44.902 --> 22:49.072
What am I really but
just a sinful woman?

22:49.907 --> 22:53.410
We are all
sinful, Judith.

22:54.077 --> 22:56.830
Ever since we were
thrown out of Paradise.

22:57.748 --> 23:00.334
That is all our burden.

27:00.031 --> 27:01.825
<i>Thor came
to a deep channel.</i>

27:02.993 --> 27:04.703
The sun dazzled
upon the water.

27:06.162 --> 27:09.457
On the far bank,
a figure sprawled
in the sun,

27:10.375 --> 27:12.794
his flat-bottomed
boat beside him.

27:14.254 --> 27:16.006
"Hey," yelled Thor.

27:16.339 --> 27:17.591
"You over there!

27:17.799 --> 27:21.177
"Are you the ferryman
and whose ferry is that?"

27:21.887 --> 27:23.555
The figure sat up.

27:23.930 --> 27:26.391
He cupped his hands
and shouted,

27:27.475 --> 27:31.646
"Hildolf,
the slaughtered wolf,
entrusted it to me!

27:31.813 --> 27:33.857
"And he has
given me my orders!

27:34.357 --> 27:36.610
"So, if you want
to cross here,

27:37.193 --> 27:40.447
"tell me your name!"
Demanded the ferryman.

27:41.156 --> 27:43.825
"Mmm, I'll tell you.

27:44.326 --> 27:47.412
"I am the son of Odin,
the strongest god of all.

27:47.954 --> 27:52.167
"So ferryman,
you are talking to Thor!"

27:53.877 --> 27:57.964
The god's words made
waves across the water,

27:58.798 --> 28:01.259
they broke at the
ferryman's feet.

28:01.885 --> 28:05.847
"Now tell me your name,"
said Thor.

28:09.225 --> 28:10.518
And the ferryman,

28:11.394 --> 28:15.398
he stood up
and he shouted,

28:16.483 --> 28:18.485
"My name is Harbard!

28:21.237 --> 28:22.948
"I seldom hide it."

28:33.583 --> 28:35.251
Have you ever met Harbard?

28:35.877 --> 28:38.213
No, not I.

28:39.714 --> 28:40.966
Perhaps your mother has.

28:45.470 --> 28:46.596
We should eat.

28:49.307 --> 28:53.144
In the spring,
will you take us to Paris?
Hvitserk and me?

28:53.645 --> 28:55.522
We must
celebrate Yol first.

28:55.605 --> 28:57.190
It's the heart of winter.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.275
But will Bjorn
be back for Yol?

29:01.987 --> 29:05.198
I do not know if, or when,
your brother will return.

29:06.616 --> 29:07.617
Come and eat.

29:55.457 --> 29:56.458
Ah!

31:16.037 --> 31:17.705
Um...

31:17.956 --> 31:19.165
The fish.

31:19.415 --> 31:22.293
- I do not care anymore.
- Just get it done.

31:23.628 --> 31:25.004
We can't
sail with this.

31:25.088 --> 31:26.131
Have we done
a head count?

31:26.214 --> 31:28.341
We have.
I counted six.

31:28.424 --> 31:29.509
Did your
father not teach you?

31:29.592 --> 31:32.303
We won't get beyond
the horizon with this sail.

31:32.387 --> 31:33.721
There's no rush.
How many times...

31:33.805 --> 31:36.057
Give it to me now.
We have enough!

31:45.150 --> 31:46.693
We have to light a fire.

31:49.779 --> 31:51.030
We can't.

31:51.781 --> 31:53.491
We're still in Mercia

31:53.575 --> 31:55.451
and they'll be
looking for us.

31:56.244 --> 31:58.037
Look at my child.

31:58.621 --> 32:01.916
He has had nothing to eat,
and he is freezing to death.

32:12.802 --> 32:14.137
No, he can't eat that.

32:14.262 --> 32:15.889
You have to eat it.

32:16.472 --> 32:18.766
You have to live.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.608
Ready, men?

32:26.691 --> 32:28.026
Yes, my Lord.

32:28.109 --> 32:30.612
Good, ready the horses.

32:46.586 --> 32:48.171
It's all right.

33:48.690 --> 33:51.901
If I give myself
freely to you,

33:53.152 --> 33:56.072
you must acknowledge me
freely as an equal.

33:56.906 --> 34:00.243
But I will only be
your mistress again

34:01.035 --> 34:04.580
if you swear on
the life of Athelstan

34:05.039 --> 34:08.293
that you will heed
and respect me.

34:08.918 --> 34:10.295
Otherwise...

34:12.547 --> 34:17.552
On the life of him
who is dearer to me
than even my own self,

34:18.511 --> 34:19.929
I do so swear.

34:21.264 --> 34:24.934
For the love I bear
not only to your son,

34:26.185 --> 34:27.770
but also to you.

34:33.275 --> 34:35.902
Now stay, or go,

34:38.697 --> 34:40.074
as you please.

38:45.778 --> 38:46.988
Mercy.

38:49.699 --> 38:50.866
Mercy.

38:53.452 --> 38:54.620
Mercy.

39:00.668 --> 39:03.713
Oh, how I've waited
for you, my friend.

39:32.616 --> 39:35.286
No, no, don't go!

39:45.921 --> 39:47.757
- One!
- One!

39:47.840 --> 39:49.717
Two! Three!

39:50.551 --> 39:51.844
Again!

39:51.927 --> 39:53.345
Five!

39:53.429 --> 39:54.513
Four!

39:55.264 --> 39:56.432
Three!

39:56.932 --> 39:58.059
Good!

40:21.957 --> 40:24.001
I'm sorry
if I disturbed you.

40:37.807 --> 40:39.100
I believe...

40:41.227 --> 40:43.145
I believe
Athelstan is dead.

40:47.233 --> 40:48.818
How do you know?

40:49.652 --> 40:51.320
He appeared to me.

40:52.154 --> 40:54.740
Here, in this room.

40:55.491 --> 40:58.702
He blessed me and made
the sign of the cross.

40:59.328 --> 41:00.996
But he was silent,

41:01.455 --> 41:04.083
and his image faded
almost as soon as I saw it.

41:04.166 --> 41:05.584
And I knew then,

41:05.668 --> 41:08.420
I knew in my heart
that he was dead.

41:17.096 --> 41:18.681
I loved him.

41:18.764 --> 41:20.015
So did I.

41:22.518 --> 41:25.271
They're coming!
There they are! They're back!

41:25.354 --> 41:26.522
I see them!

41:27.022 --> 41:28.816
They're back!

41:30.818 --> 41:31.902
Praise the Lord!

41:31.986 --> 41:33.195
All safe?

41:54.717 --> 41:55.926
Queen Kwenthrith.

41:57.178 --> 41:59.138
Thank God, you are free.

41:59.930 --> 42:02.266
I do thank our Lord,
King Ecbert.

42:02.766 --> 42:05.144
But also your son,
Aethelwulf.

42:06.228 --> 42:09.106
He saved me and my child
from certain death.

42:10.691 --> 42:13.986
So, this is Magnus.

42:14.737 --> 42:17.031
Yes, this is Magnus.

42:17.740 --> 42:20.242
The son of
Ragnar Lothbrok.

42:20.826 --> 42:24.246
Yes, and heir to
the throne of Mercia.

42:25.831 --> 42:29.627
Come inside.
Eat, sleep, bathe.

42:29.793 --> 42:31.587
Forget your terrors.

42:31.962 --> 42:33.255
You are safe now.

42:34.924 --> 42:35.883
Stand down!

42:36.217 --> 42:37.593
You've been crying.

42:38.093 --> 42:41.222
Can't a woman cry when
her husband returns
from a dangerous place?

42:43.474 --> 42:46.936
They are tears of joy,
Aethelwulf, tears of joy.

42:56.987 --> 42:58.864
How is Magnus?

42:59.031 --> 43:00.574
He is sleeping.

43:01.325 --> 43:02.493
He ate well

43:02.826 --> 43:05.120
for the first time
in many days.

43:06.205 --> 43:08.123
I did not think
he would survive.

43:08.207 --> 43:09.750
He is a Viking.

43:11.919 --> 43:13.170
Yes.

43:14.922 --> 43:18.384
Did you hear about
the latest exploits
of Ragnar?

43:18.968 --> 43:20.135
No.

43:20.219 --> 43:23.222
He and a great army
attacked Paris.

43:23.764 --> 43:25.933
Ragnar pretended
to be dead,

43:26.183 --> 43:27.977
and was carried
into the city,

43:28.060 --> 43:30.187
only to jump
out of his coffin

43:30.646 --> 43:32.398
and open the gates
for his warriors.

43:37.861 --> 43:40.948
That's so ridiculous
it must be true.

43:41.657 --> 43:43.575
And my teacher Prudentius
told me that

43:43.659 --> 43:45.911
many of the Northmen
fell sick and died

43:45.995 --> 43:47.955
after entering
the cathedral.

43:48.247 --> 43:49.999
That God punished them.

43:53.627 --> 43:55.838
I cannot believe
Ragnar died.

43:56.839 --> 43:58.966
Ragnar Lothbrok is not dead.

44:00.175 --> 44:02.553
He is no ordinary mortal.

44:04.013 --> 44:05.222
I know it.

44:05.306 --> 44:08.642
I can feel it in my soul.
I just know.

44:09.643 --> 44:10.894
Hmm.

44:11.103 --> 44:12.855
But Athelstan...

44:13.856 --> 44:15.024
The monk?

44:17.359 --> 44:19.987
Athelstan is dead.

44:23.073 --> 44:25.492
Why is that
so important to you?

44:34.877 --> 44:39.256
Athelstan is the father
of my child...

44:40.382 --> 44:41.383
Alfred.

44:42.551 --> 44:45.471
The father? But...

44:45.554 --> 44:47.556
When Aethelwulf found out,

44:48.349 --> 44:51.727
they cut off my ear
as punishment.

44:54.563 --> 44:55.731
Oh...

44:58.150 --> 44:59.568
Judith.

45:27.096 --> 45:28.430
Aethelwulf.

45:29.431 --> 45:31.642
Yes, come to me.

47:01.857 --> 47:05.360
And you shall
call my name nine times

47:05.611 --> 47:08.864
and nine times shall
I come and visit you.

47:09.656 --> 47:11.033
Nine times.

47:15.871 --> 47:17.956
And shall be so gentle...

47:18.498 --> 47:20.209
What are you going to do?

47:21.293 --> 47:23.003
And you shall
come with me...

47:23.086 --> 47:24.880
You've suffered
enough, Helga.

47:26.548 --> 47:27.799
So generous.

47:31.428 --> 47:34.223
And you shall be so
generous to let me go.

47:34.306 --> 47:36.099
I shall go and you...
