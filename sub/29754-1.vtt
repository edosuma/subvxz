(speaking in foreign language)

42:00.986 --> 42:04.988

(gentle music)

44:30.702 --> 44:33.770
(speaking in foreign language)

44:33.772 --> 44:37.507
- [Taliban Man] Are you
tourist in Kandahar?

44:40.245 --> 44:42.278
- I was a soldier.

44:42.280 --> 44:45.081
Three years ago, with the
Australians in Uruzgan.

44:45.083 --> 44:49.052
(speaking in foreign language)

44:49.954 --> 44:51.621
We did a raid on a village.

44:51.623 --> 44:53.756
(speaking in foreign language)

44:53.758 --> 44:54.691
Gaz-i-kar.

44:54.693 --> 44:57.560
(speaking in foreign language)

44:57.562 --> 45:01.531
A man stepped into his
doorway and I shot him.

45:02.333 --> 45:06.035
(speaking in foreign language)

45:06.037 --> 45:10.740
A woman and children dragged
his body back inside the house.

45:10.742 --> 45:14.911
(speaking in foreign language)

45:14.913 --> 45:16.446
That money's for them.

45:16.981 --> 45:21.050
(speaking in foreign language)

45:23.555 --> 45:25.421
- This is compensation?

45:27.258 --> 45:28.458
- Yeah.

45:32.697 --> 45:35.398
(speaking in foreign language)

45:35.400 --> 45:38.835
- [Translator] Why do you
care about one dead Afghan?

45:38.837 --> 45:41.104
(speaking in foreign language)

45:41.106 --> 45:43.740
Your people have
killed thousands of us.

(speaking in foreign language)

45:53.251 --> 45:56.085
(wind whooshing)

45:57.922 --> 46:01.657

47:40.058 --> 47:40.957
Face.

47:48.600 --> 47:49.498
- English?

47:50.635 --> 47:51.801
- Little bit.

47:57.442 --> 47:59.108
- What's your name?

48:00.845 --> 48:01.744
- Amir.

48:02.680 --> 48:03.579
- Amir.

48:06.417 --> 48:07.316

48:12.957 --> 48:15.024

(quiet somber music)

49:50.755 --> 49:54.323
(speaking in foreign language)

49:54.325 --> 49:55.391
Not too far.

50:29.694 --> 50:33.696
(speaking in foreign language)

50:34.665 --> 50:36.799
One of my brother died here.

50:36.801 --> 50:39.001
He had a shop in Kabul.

50:41.272 --> 50:45.441
(speaking in foreign language)

50:45.443 --> 50:49.678
He come back to see
his wife and children.

50:49.680 --> 50:53.816
(speaking in foreign language)

50:53.818 --> 50:56.452
Everyone was murdered here.

50:56.454 --> 51:00.623
My brother and his wife
and three children.

51:00.625 --> 51:03.225
They murdered by American drone.

51:07.331 --> 51:13.402
For us they are all our father,
grandfather, uncles, children,

51:14.872 --> 51:18.040
wife, brothers, sisters.

51:18.042 --> 51:22.011
But for your people this
is just an accident.

51:28.052 --> 51:31.353
(helicopters whirring)

51:42.867 --> 51:45.634
(wind whooshing)

52:16.033 --> 52:19.768
(Taliban softly whispering)

52:20.771 --> 52:23.606
(dramatic music)

52:40.424 --> 52:45.427
(stones clattering)
(somber music)

53:46.123 --> 53:50.192
(speaking in foreign language)

53:59.237 --> 54:01.303
This is special for you.

54:02.974 --> 54:07.743
We Pashtun say death,
honour, fuller stomach better

54:07.745 --> 54:09.511
than a life of hunger.

54:11.649 --> 54:12.548
Eat.

54:15.019 --> 54:16.452
- [Mike] Janaat?

54:16.454 --> 54:19.421
- [Amir] Janaat make
this for you special.

54:23.761 --> 54:24.660
- Good.

54:27.932 --> 54:31.500
Please tell him thank
you, it's very good.

54:32.536 --> 54:36.605
(speaking in foreign language)

54:46.284 --> 54:48.851
- Just eat and no worries.

55:06.203 --> 55:10.172
(speaking in foreign language)

55:14.445 --> 55:18.547
You want to give this money
to the dead man's family.

55:18.549 --> 55:22.384
To a Pashtun it's like
selling you his dead.

55:24.221 --> 55:28.223
(speaking in foreign language)

55:29.126 --> 55:30.859
Pride loves revenge.

55:35.666 --> 55:38.467
(dramatic music)

55:44.008 --> 55:47.576
(people chattering softly)

56:23.814 --> 56:26.615
(wind whooshing)

56:33.758 --> 56:35.591
- [Mike] Where
are you taking me?

56:35.593 --> 56:37.893
- [Amir] We are
taking you to Rasigah.

56:39.563 --> 56:41.530
- Why are you helping me?

56:41.832 --> 56:42.898
- You are our guest.

56:44.635 --> 56:46.001
- I'm a hostage.

56:46.570 --> 56:47.803
- Same thing.

56:49.407 --> 56:52.574
If you want to say sorry
to these villagers,

56:53.043 --> 56:54.977
you need to say.

56:54.979 --> 56:58.981
(speaking in foreign language)

57:19.236 --> 57:22.304
(bottle clattering)

57:33.284 --> 57:36.518
(children chattering)

57:40.291 --> 57:41.123
No.

57:41.125 --> 57:44.026
(engines revving)

58:22.666 --> 58:26.668
(speaking in foreign language)

58:48.325 --> 58:49.224
Let's go.

58:51.695 --> 58:55.664
(speaking in foreign language)

58:57.701 --> 59:00.536
(wind whooshing)

59:25.095 --> 59:28.196
- [Amir] The village chief,
his name is Dawood Khan.

59:38.142 --> 59:39.741
- [Amir] This money is a curse.

59:42.813 --> 59:45.581
(wind whooshing)

59:57.294 --> 01:00:00.529
(gentle somber music)

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:15.871
(papers rustling)

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:39.294
(speaking in foreign language)

01:02:17.835 --> 01:02:20.669
(wind whooshing)

01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:39.721
(dog barking)

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.498
(people chattering)

01:02:56.507 --> 01:02:59.441
(speaking in foreign language)

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:01.510
- Why you come here for?

01:03:01.512 --> 01:03:03.478
For what you come here?

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:05.747
- I've been here before.

01:03:06.784 --> 01:03:08.717
I took part in the raid.

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:12.754
- Why you come back here?

01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:15.023
- [Mike] I killed
one of your brothers.

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:16.825
I'm here to confess.

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:52.761
- We came in from over here.

01:03:54.097 --> 01:03:58.200
(speaking in foreign language)

01:03:58.202 --> 01:04:00.735
The helicopter
dropped us over there.

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:03.905
(speaking in foreign language)

01:04:03.907 --> 01:04:06.608
Three of my team were with me.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:10.679
(speaking in foreign language)

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:14.416
The rest came in from behind.

01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:19.988
(speaking in foreign language)

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:23.091
Men were firing from
a compound over there.

01:04:23.093 --> 01:04:25.293
I know now they
were not Taliban.

01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:29.264
Just your men protecting their
homes and their families.

01:04:29.266 --> 01:04:33.335
(speaking in foreign language)

01:04:36.607 --> 01:04:38.473
We passed the edge
of this building.

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:43.378
(speaking in foreign language)

01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:52.854
We came to this wall.

01:04:53.457 --> 01:04:54.956
There was a burst of gunfire.

01:04:55.759 --> 01:04:59.895
(speaking in foreign language)

01:04:59.897 --> 01:05:01.563
And as I turned,

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.665
(speaking in foreign language)

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:06.001
a man stepped into
that doorway there.

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:10.071
(speaking in foreign language)

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:14.843
Before I knew it, I shot him.

01:05:14.845 --> 01:05:18.747
(speaking in foreign language)

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:23.051
A woman and children dragged
his body back inside.

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:28.023
(speaking in foreign language)

01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:30.659
But I knew he was dead.

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:35.430
(speaking in foreign language)

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:36.398
This is the place.

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:41.303
(speaking in foreign language)

01:05:41.305 --> 01:05:42.971
- [Tranlsator] The
man that was shot,

01:05:42.973 --> 01:05:45.073
his name was Atta-Ulah Khan.

01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:47.042
Just a musician.

01:05:48.812 --> 01:05:52.914
(speaking in foreign language)

01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:57.986
(baby crying)
(dramatic music)

01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:41.997
(woman crying)

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:45.934
(speaking in foreign language)

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:54.542

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:56.304
(people chattering)

01:07:57.541 --> 01:08:01.509
(speaking in foreign language)

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:44.685
(speaking in foreign language)

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:46.613
(knife scrapes)

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:51.618
(Mike gasping)

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:23.585
(knife scrapes)

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:31.192
(gentle music)

01:10:38.034 --> 01:10:42.036
(speaking in foreign language)

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:58.386

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.095
(speaking in foreign language)

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:44.565
(sheep baaing)

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:50.104
(Mike gasping)

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.247
(wind whooshing)

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.294
(gentle music)

01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:30.665
