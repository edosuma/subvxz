BY ONE OF OUR DESTROYERS.

43:32.068 --> 43:33.684
I GOT OUT.

43:33.778 --> 43:36.611
YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT, CAPTAIN?

43:36.697 --> 43:40.691

44:35.256 --> 44:38.169
JUST LISTEN TO A LITTLE
LOGIC, A LITTLE REASON!

44:38.217 --> 44:43.007
ONE MAN DOES NOT SINK A SUB, AND ONE LOUSY
OIROUMSTANOE DOES NOT DECIDE A BATTLE,

44:43.097 --> 44:46.806
AND ONE CASE OF SUDDEN FEAR
DOES NOT ADD UP TO A COVVARD.

44:49.854 --> 44:51.720

THAT VVAS A CREVV THAT VVAS
DOOMED, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

45:11.334 --> 45:15.202

THAT SHIP OR KILL OFF THAT CREVV.

45:15.254 --> 45:18.212
BELL! YOU'VE GOT
TO UNDERSTAND.

45:18.257 --> 45:22.216
A WAR DID! A SET

45:22.303 --> 45:25.796
NOVV, BELL, YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME.
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

45:25.890 --> 45:28.757
ALL YOU SHOULD PUT IN YOUR SEA
BAG IS A REGRET, NOT A GUILT.

45:28.851 --> 45:32.560
DO YOU UNDERSTAND,
BELL? NOT A GUILT!

45:46.577 --> 45:49.410

VVE'\/E BEEN SEARCHING FOR TEN HOURS, SIR.
IT'S NO USE.

47:06.449 --> 47:08.360
WE CAN'T FIND
THE BODY.

47:16.417 --> 47:20.001
THE RESCUE TEAM OUGHT TO BE IN

NOBODY HAD A CHANCE.

48:00.795 --> 48:03.457
NOBODY?

48:03.547 --> 48:05.413
NOBODY, SIR.

48:07.593 --> 48:10.551
THE PERISCOPE SHEARS
HAD BEEN CUT IN HALF,

48:10.596 --> 48:16.091
AND ONE VVHOLE SECTION VVAS JUST HANGING
THERE SVVINGING BACK AND FORTH.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.352
THAT WAS MAKING
THE NOISE THEN.

48:21.732 --> 48:25.100
THAT WAS MAKING
THE NOISE, WASN'T IT?

48:26.487 --> 48:27.898
I GUESS SO, SIR.

48:29.782 --> 48:30.988
BUT--

48:31.075 --> 48:33.316
BUT WHAT?

48:33.411 --> 48:35.743
THERE WERE EIGHT MEN
IN THE CONTROL ROOM.

48:37.415 --> 48:39.656
EIGHT MEN, OR WHAT
WAS LEFT OF THEM, AND--

48:41.752 --> 48:43.288
ONE OF THEM--

48:44.839 --> 48:47.297
ONE OF THEM HAD
A HAMMER IN HIS HAND.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.680
MCCLURE,

48:56.767 --> 48:59.429
LET'S JUST SAY THAT
THAT'S PART OF THE STORY

48:59.520 --> 49:01.636

YOUR GRANDCHILDREN,

49:01.730 --> 49:03.641
THAT YOU MAKE UP YOURSELF.

49:05.276 --> 49:07.358
TELL THEM ANYTHING
YOU LIKE.

49:08.446 --> 49:10.107
AYE, SIR.

49:17.621 --> 49:20.704
FUNNY THING HOW LONG IT
TAKES SOME MEN TO DIE

49:20.791 --> 49:23.704
OR TO FIND ANY
PEACE AT ALL.

49:23.794 --> 49:29.380
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT'S THE
VVORST THING THERE IS ABOUT VVAR.

49:29.467 --> 49:32.300
NOT JUST WHAT IT
DOES TO THE BODIES,

49:32.344 --> 49:35.837
BUT WHAT IT DOES
TO THE MINDS.

49:53.073 --> 49:55.986

PEACE, CHIEF BELL.
