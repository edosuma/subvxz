WEBVTT

00:19.519 --> 00:23.148
See? Your first night out as a single guy.

00:23.231 --> 00:26.234
Didn't I tell you
goin' dancin' would make you happy?

00:26.317 --> 00:29.863
Isn't it great? I don't even care
that we're the oldest gays in the club.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.866
-Oh shit.
-No, honey. You keep dancing.

00:32.949 --> 00:35.577
-We have as much right to be here--
-I think that's Colin.

00:37.037 --> 00:40.457
-Well, first of all, you look fantastic.
-You really do. So hot.

00:41.666 --> 00:42.584
It's not him.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.501
Oh, thank God.

00:43.585 --> 00:47.672
I'm not even sure if I'm happy or not
that that wasn't him. I need a drink.

00:47.756 --> 00:51.051
Mikey, there's only one way
you're gonna move on from this.

00:51.134 --> 00:54.054
Yeah, it's been one whole week.
Enough with the wallowing.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.890
Sorry. I just think
if you wanna start feelin' better,

00:56.973 --> 00:58.975
you gotta pop your Colin-cherry
and get laid.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.436
So eloquent. Sadly, I don't disagree.

01:01.936 --> 01:05.482
So glad to know that you're both
on the same page about what's best for me.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.150
Uh, three vodka sodas, please.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.319
What do you guys want?

01:10.945 --> 01:13.573
Look how many guys in the club
are on Grindr right now.

01:13.656 --> 01:16.910
You could hook up tonight and be one step
closer to your future happy Michael.

01:16.993 --> 01:20.413
Why are they on Grindr
when they're right next to us?

01:20.497 --> 01:22.040
That's how you meet people now.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.335
You've been away a long time,
Rip Van Winkle.

01:25.418 --> 01:29.047
Nice. Oh, I'm so not up for this.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.673
I was late to the Grindr party,

01:30.757 --> 01:34.177
but it does actually cut the chitchat
and get you down to business.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.098
Sorry, Claire Lewis.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.475
Your rich divorcée?

01:40.558 --> 01:42.560
She typically text you after midnight?

01:42.644 --> 01:47.065
Ah, she's a little demanding, but I need
to keep her happy. She's my golden goose.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.191
-Ooh!

01:48.274 --> 01:51.736
Twenty-something else,
less than 50 feet away, very cute.

01:51.820 --> 01:55.281
Billy, we are here to support our friend,
not abandon him for a hookup.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.368
I'm just showing him how easy it is.
Oh, he's so into me.

02:00.286 --> 02:03.832
Claire again? Sweetie, that is not
the notification you wanna get in here.

02:03.915 --> 02:06.084
I am not interested
in getting back in the game,

02:06.167 --> 02:08.378
looking at naked selfies on my phone.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.798
I don't want my first time to have sex
with someone after 17 years with Colin

02:11.881 --> 02:13.925
to be a quick, anonymous fuck.

02:14.008 --> 02:17.095
What are you lookin' for?
Dinner and a movie? Come on.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.931
You must've fooled around with other guys
during your relationship.

02:20.014 --> 02:23.059
Not really. I put the mono in monogamy.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.018
Or monotony.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.812
Up top.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.857
-No. No.
-If and when I'm ready to have…

02:29.524 --> 02:31.109
To put myself out there.

02:31.192 --> 02:33.695
Oh, Jesus, I can't believe
I'm even saying this.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.197
I-- I want it to be a little special.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.615
Good luck with that, sweetie.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.119
Nowadays, special is when they still
wanna have sex with you after you show up.

02:41.202 --> 02:44.747
I think they're all special.
Like snowflakes. No two alike.

02:44.831 --> 02:48.084
You just gotta get 'em before they melt.
Don't wait up, boys.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.838
She can torture a metaphor,
but she always gets her man-child.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.884
Wait, no, no, no, no.
Stay a little bit longer, please.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.178
It gets lonely at night in the apartment.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.180
Oh, Michael.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.141
It gets better, you'll see.

03:03.224 --> 03:04.434
What if it doesn't?

03:04.976 --> 03:08.438
-What if I wind up bitter and alone like--
-Careful.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.357
-I was gonna say, "Like Claire."
-Oh!

03:11.900 --> 03:12.859
Yeah, so sad.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.044
-Oh, hey, Diane.
-Hello, Michael.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.254
I just got a delivery from the drugstore,

03:33.338 --> 03:37.050
and along with my medications,
there was also this one for Colin.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.637
Hmm. Must be his Propecia.
All smoke and mirrors up there.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.598
Oh.
I heard you two split up.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.767
And I guess it didn't end well,

03:45.850 --> 03:48.895
after seeing the way
you scratched his name off the mailbox.

03:48.978 --> 03:49.896
Thanks, Diane.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.564
-Can you send me--
-Bye-bye now.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.074
Colin's on PrEP.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.993
So the thing he needs to figure out alone

04:04.077 --> 04:07.956
is how to fuck his way across
New York City without getting a disease.

04:08.039 --> 04:11.084
Well, I'm glad we solved that mystery.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.253
Well, at least he's being responsible.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.838
Do you really think this warrants
a look on the bright side?

04:15.922 --> 04:17.090
Sorry. Slut!

04:19.133 --> 04:23.554
Anyway, this may be
just the push I need to get off my ass

04:23.638 --> 04:26.015
and hopefully up into somebody else's.

04:26.099 --> 04:30.520
Say hello to Grindr's newest Grindee.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.689
-Quick turnaround!
-Huh?

04:32.772 --> 04:34.482
Which, by the way,
you hear a lot on Grindr.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.693
Here, help me pick a photo.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.361
Um…

04:38.444 --> 04:40.446
Ooh, how about this one?
We just had it taken.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.615
It's our company ad.
If I crop out Suzanne…

04:42.699 --> 04:45.285
Mm, sorry, darling.
You're a bit ragged around the eyes.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.703
Suzanne looks great, though.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.706
She should crop you out
and put it on her profile.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.791
-This is why you have no friends.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.501
Hmm. Oh, here's a good one.

04:53.584 --> 04:54.877
-Oh,
-Ooh, post that.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.671
-Okay.
-Mm!

04:56.754 --> 04:57.964
Hey.

04:58.047 --> 05:01.217
It's not a bar stool. You need to move
so other people can use it.

05:01.301 --> 05:05.013
I'm training him. I'm in the middle
of a session, so easy. Let's go. Six.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.597
-Six.
-Come on now. Seven.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.683
-Seven. Thanks.
-Now bend the knees. Eight.

05:08.766 --> 05:09.600
Uh, eight.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.813
Let's check the grid.
See who in here is on the prowl.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.899
-Hmm.
-Oh. Oh!

05:16.983 --> 05:18.318
-He's cute.
-Mm.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.153
-GreatNateEight.
-Oh!

05:20.236 --> 05:21.904
Catchy, informative.

05:21.988 --> 05:26.075
No Sondheim in the rhyming department,
but definitely worth a quick turnaround.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.535
-Nice.
-Text him.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.747
I'm actually doing this.
Okay. Okay. Okay! Here goes.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.960
How long does it usually take before--

05:38.880 --> 05:39.922
Um…

05:40.006 --> 05:41.758
-I am not hating this.

05:47.805 --> 05:48.681
Uh-oh.

05:50.892 --> 05:51.809
-What happened?

05:51.893 --> 05:55.271
You need a dick pic. You won't get
anywhere on this without one.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.774
It's like your Grindr passport photo.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.901
You have a dick pic?

06:01.027 --> 06:03.196
Oh no, I believe you.
You do not have to show--

06:03.279 --> 06:04.614
Relax.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.825
An artist I represent did it.
Something different for the people.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.746
What, you actually sat for that,
like <i>Whistler's Mother?</i>

06:12.246 --> 06:15.041
I like the kind of men it attracts.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.794
For instance,
I'll be in Rhinebeck antiquing,

06:17.877 --> 06:19.837
and I'll get a tap and realize

06:19.921 --> 06:23.591
that we are both looking
at the same 19th-century school chair.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.676
Next thing you know,
I'm face down in a barn.

06:26.677 --> 06:27.804
-Great.
-Mm.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.889
Now there's two images
I can't unsee.

07:03.005 --> 07:06.509
-Can I give you a hand with that?
-I'm good. I'm good. Sorry.

07:18.646 --> 07:21.065
Sorry I'm late. Crazy morning.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.152
Ugh! My girlfriend Mia and I
went out for drinks last night.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.487
And not only did she meet somebody
in five minutes

07:26.571 --> 07:28.823
while I ate hot wings
and played <i>Candy Crush,</i>

07:28.906 --> 07:31.033
but I left my credit card at the bar.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.202
So I had to wait for them
to open this morning.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.746
I didn't wanna look
like I needed a drink at eleven o'clock.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.290
So I walk down the block,

07:37.373 --> 07:40.460
and my heel gets caught in a subway grate
and snaps the fuck off.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.838
$400 pair of SJPs
literally down the drain.

07:43.921 --> 07:47.008
Oh my God!
My life right now is literally just…

07:48.593 --> 07:49.427
Sorry.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.222
How are you?

07:53.306 --> 07:55.224
That's okay. I know you liked it better

07:55.308 --> 07:58.269
when you were the disaster,
and I was the boring, old married guy.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.228
I really did.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.646
-Me too.

08:01.230 --> 08:05.109
I've been working on the figures
for Claire Lewis's broker's open.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.652
This listing is so next-level,

08:06.736 --> 08:11.032
and given my reduced circumstances,
I really need this commission.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.993
This event can't look cheap.
We're gonna have to spend some money.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.913
-We've gotta sell this bitch.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.957
I can feel my Amex card begging me
to put it out of its misery.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.584
Suzanne Prentiss.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.759
So congrats on poaching Claire.
Heard you had to reduce your commission.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.471
Yeah, well, it's still
a fuckload of money.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.264
Well, I hope it's worth it.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.935
I almost didn't have the energy
to deal with her. And I'm young.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.356
I'll be fine, Tyler.
We've actually made a genuine connection.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.651
Oh, right. The whole parallel
lives falling apart thing.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.904
I can see it's really taking its toll.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.743
Honey, our luck has just changed.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.620
We have a new client.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.038
Paolo Forella,

08:59.121 --> 09:03.042
a big Italian furniture importer
in from Rome tomorrow for one day,

09:03.125 --> 09:06.087
and he needs to lock down a pied-à-terre
in the two million range,

09:06.170 --> 09:08.798
and he wants us
to put together a multiple showing.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.967
That's great. Who referred us?

09:11.050 --> 09:13.219
No one. He said
he picked us from our picture.

09:13.302 --> 09:15.137
I told you those photos would pay off.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.306
Only you look good in this picture.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.517
I look ragged.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.396
Oh my-- oh my God. He is so hot.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.439
Oh-ho-ho!

09:25.523 --> 09:27.900
Recently divorced. Check.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.860
Two grown kids. Check.

09:29.944 --> 09:33.739
Residences in Rome and Positano.
Check! Check!

09:33.823 --> 09:35.199
Oh-ho-ho!

09:35.283 --> 09:38.578
Paolo, <i>mi amor.</i> <i>Molto bello.</i>

09:38.661 --> 09:41.747
Why did I eat all those fucking wings?

09:41.831 --> 09:42.707
He's okay.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.626
Do you think I should get my eyes done?

09:59.473 --> 10:03.603
No. Delete, delete. He's not watching!
He's not watching!

10:07.189 --> 10:08.107
<i>What up, Mikey?</i>

10:08.691 --> 10:11.944
I'm just eatin' Chinese
and missing fucking Colin.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.990
Aww. Sorry, baby.
But Stanley told me you're on Grindr.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.659
So pants off to you. What's your handle?

10:19.327 --> 10:23.414
I haven't thought about it.
How about MikeNewToThis?

10:23.497 --> 10:27.168
Because you're a young Amish boy who
just arrived in the big bad city?

10:27.251 --> 10:29.629
Gina, get under my eyes.
I had a very late night.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.380
You need somethin' sexy,

10:31.464 --> 10:35.676
like HungAlphaJock or NineHardForYou.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.054
Which, memory serves,
is a bit of an exaggeration,

10:38.137 --> 10:39.930
but nobody's coming in with a ruler.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.142
Jesus, your makeup lady is right there.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.061
How about PiggyWantACumHole?

10:46.354 --> 10:47.480
Oh my God.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.232
<i>Gina's seen it all.</i>
<i>She used to do Charlie Rose.</i>

10:50.316 --> 10:53.694
Look, all I'm saying is make sure
you pick something that says you're DTF.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.113
AthleticTop?

10:56.197 --> 10:57.573
Sounds like a sports bra.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.660
From personal experience,
wouldn't AthleticVers be more accurate?

11:00.743 --> 11:01.786
Okay. You know what?

11:01.869 --> 11:05.331
One hookup, 25 years ago, Billy.
People change.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.376
Don't you have to mispredict the weather?

11:08.459 --> 11:10.961
Sweetie, I just look pretty
and read the shit.

11:11.754 --> 11:15.091
Look, you know what?
Ooh. I'm gonna go with NewHotMike.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.678
-Oh! I have a message waiting.
-<i>There you go.</i>

11:18.761 --> 11:19.970
Message back.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.851
-<i>What'd he say?</i>
-It's a pic.

11:25.935 --> 11:29.814
But I can't really tell what it is.
Oh my God! It's a butthole. Classy.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.191
-Ah!

11:32.274 --> 11:34.402
-Welcome to Grindr, NewHotMike.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.071
-On set in five.
-Oh, I'm on. I love you.

11:37.571 --> 11:38.698
You too.

11:50.042 --> 11:50.876
Claire?

11:51.502 --> 11:52.503
Up here.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.765
Oh my God.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.060
How did this happen?

12:10.563 --> 12:11.856
I had a moment.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.735
You did this? Why?

12:16.652 --> 12:17.486
My hus--

12:18.237 --> 12:21.282
My ex-husband went to visit our daughter,

12:21.782 --> 12:25.536
sorry, our kid, at Brown this weekend,

12:25.619 --> 12:30.583
and brought his whore, gold-digging
girlfriend along to meet them.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.085
As you can see, I didn't take it well.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.589
I'm… so sorry.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.718
This used to be his favorite room.

12:41.469 --> 12:46.015
It still has so many
of his most treasured possessions.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.977
Had. I'll show you a fucking hole in one.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.395
-Oh!

12:52.730 --> 12:54.148
Okay. Oh--

12:58.194 --> 13:00.654
-Would you like a drink?
-Yes, please.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.745
Vodka all right?

13:07.828 --> 13:08.662
Sure.

13:09.497 --> 13:13.000
So, obviously we'll need to postpone
the broker's open

13:13.083 --> 13:14.502
till we can deal with all this,

13:14.585 --> 13:18.339
but moving forward, don't you have
anyone you can vent to about this

13:18.422 --> 13:22.760
so we can avoid a, you know,
future gut renovation?

13:23.552 --> 13:24.386
Yeah.

13:25.137 --> 13:25.971
Oh.

13:26.764 --> 13:27.598
Me.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.811
-Have a seat.
-Sure, yeah. Let's… Uh, sure.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.105
I'll sit right here in Beirut.

13:35.189 --> 13:38.651
And why not? Our lives are in ruins.

13:39.235 --> 13:42.363
I think my apartment
would look exactly like this

13:42.446 --> 13:45.533
if I didn't have
a great support system of friends.

13:45.616 --> 13:48.035
They've been helping me through a lot,

13:48.536 --> 13:51.664
forcing me to put myself out there.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.124
You know, to try to somehow move on.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.378
Most of my so-called friends
went with Henry.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.839
Half of them even knew about the affair.

14:00.506 --> 14:04.385
In a split like mine,
people follow the money and the access.

14:04.468 --> 14:07.555
He's even gotten my children
to see his side!

14:07.638 --> 14:11.475
It's dead, Claire! You can quit trying
to murder it. The room is already dead.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.354
Why do you even have a sledgehammer?

14:15.437 --> 14:17.439
Well, I didn't until this evening.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.567
Amazon Prime, same-day delivery.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.860
Oh.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.821
Really should think
about a three-day waiting period.

14:24.321 --> 14:27.867
You know, until this happened,
the divorce, I mean…

14:30.619 --> 14:36.125
I never would have considered myself
a person capable of actual rage.

14:36.750 --> 14:37.835
But look around.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.881
That is exactly what I feel
most of the time.

14:43.257 --> 14:48.053
All I can afford to destroy is
a Tiffany-framed picture of us.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.973
Deeply unsatisfying.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.017
-I should have just ripped up the photo.

14:53.684 --> 14:57.187
Oh, it would've been so much easier
if he had just died.

14:58.606 --> 15:02.735
Making funeral arrangements,
choosing what I would wear to the funeral,

15:02.818 --> 15:04.528
having people over after the funeral.

15:04.612 --> 15:08.490
All of those activities
seem fun compared to this.

15:09.658 --> 15:13.370
He's off in another life,
and I'm stuck in the one he's left behind.

15:13.871 --> 15:14.914
I know.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.542
But maybe not for long.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.587
I hope not for long.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.300
Thank you for coming over tonight.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.346
This has helped. Talking to you.

15:30.429 --> 15:34.850
Mm. Even if our friendship
is commission-based.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.101
Glad to be here.

15:38.729 --> 15:43.651
So you're done hobbling the apartment,
Annie Wilkes from <i>Misery,</i>

15:43.734 --> 15:45.736
or do I need to take this with me?

15:47.821 --> 15:48.906
You should take it.

15:53.827 --> 15:54.662
Hey.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.750
Really? It's a showing, Suzanne,

15:59.833 --> 16:02.336
not ladies drink free night
at the Lizard Lounge.

16:02.920 --> 16:03.796
Too much?

16:03.879 --> 16:06.715
Only if you're not expecting cash
on the nightstand later.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.427
Oh. Perfect. If you think it's a little
slutty, then I'm in the right area.

16:11.178 --> 16:14.056
And what is goin' on with you?
You look tired, like in our photo.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.265
Ugh, I didn't get much sleep.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.226
Claire had a meltdown
in the middle of the night.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.894
I had to go over. It was a whole thing.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.272
Wow. Those are some seriously
blurry boundaries.

16:22.356 --> 16:25.901
Be careful. Mixing business
with your personal life is a huge mistake.

16:25.985 --> 16:26.860
Oh! There he is.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.405
Paolo Forella.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.657
<i>-Ciao,</i> Paolo. Suzanne Prentiss.
<i>-Ciao.</i>

16:31.740 --> 16:33.784
-How lovely to meet you.
-Pleasure.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.578
Hi. Michael Lawson. Shall we?

16:36.662 --> 16:37.913
-Sure.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.795
Prime location, spectacular views.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.964
Three terraces. Come on.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.966
Lots of light. Wow.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.803
Uh…

16:52.886 --> 16:55.723
I'm sorry, but it feels
a little corporate.

16:55.806 --> 16:59.101
Oh, well, that's the trouble
with new construction. No soul.

16:59.601 --> 17:00.602
Not like in Rome,

17:00.686 --> 17:04.440
with those wonderful buildings
still standing after centuries.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.775
-You've been to <i>Roma?</i>
-<i>Sì.</i>

17:07.276 --> 17:10.821
Oh! Loved. I backpacked
all through Europe after college

17:10.904 --> 17:14.950
and just spent one whole day
just sitting in the Colosseum.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.952
-Yeah.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.872
Yeah, it was back when they were still
feeding Christians to the lions.

17:19.955 --> 17:22.041
-So funny.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.083
-Ju--
-Ah.

17:23.167 --> 17:27.755
Michael can only make that joke because
Suzanna is so young and-- and beautiful.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.298
Aww!

17:31.592 --> 17:35.095
Sorry, but-- but this apartment,
it-- it is not for me.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.724
And because of time, please, can you
show me the photo of the rest of them?

17:38.807 --> 17:41.393
-Oh--
-Then we can only go to the one I choose.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.936
-Great idea.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.606
Ah! Okay,
so this is a two-bedroom, two-bath

17:45.689 --> 17:47.107
with a large terrace in Turtle Bay.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.194
-Turtle Bay? <i>Grazie, </i>no.
-Oh.

17:50.277 --> 17:53.363
Okay, well, this next one, it--
it is on the hill.

17:53.864 --> 17:54.698
Um… Ahem.

17:54.782 --> 17:58.160
It's, uh, newly renovated,
three bedrooms, high floor.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.245
-Yeah, I like this one. Let's see it.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.749
-Great.
-<i>Scusi. </i>I gotta take this, sorry.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.125
Sure.

18:05.209 --> 18:08.128
-What the fuck with the dick pics?
-It was for my Grindr profile.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.464
I must have mistakenly saved it
into the wrong folder.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.007
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.383
-Oh my God.
-Okay, wait, wait.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.344
It went by pretty fast.
Maybe he didn't notice.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.138
-Just pretend it never happened.
-Okay. Good. Yeah.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.098
Ready?

18:19.181 --> 18:22.267
Oh! We're calling a car, Paolo.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.770
I know you're
on a pretty tight cock. Clock!

18:30.192 --> 18:31.193
Okay.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.489
<i>-Bravo. </i>I love that apartment.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.992
-Oh!
-And I love this street.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.578
It feels already like home.
I hope they accept my offer.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.372
Oh…

18:43.455 --> 18:46.917
I have a very good feeling about this.
Thank you.

18:51.588 --> 18:55.676
You know, Paolo, this is one
of the great New York neighborhoods.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.178
Il Cantinori,
my favorite Italian restaurant,

18:58.262 --> 18:59.847
is right around the corner.

18:59.930 --> 19:03.100
You must let me take you there
once we close.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.812
Perhaps I can cook you
a real Italian dinner at my new apartment.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.480
-Oh! I would love that.

19:11.525 --> 19:16.780
And, um, Paolo, if there's anything
that you need before you move in,

19:17.573 --> 19:21.660
I would be more than happy
to, uh… move some boxes for you.

19:21.743 --> 19:25.706
And my interior design, from what I hear,

19:25.789 --> 19:29.168
I mean, that's what they tell me,
is just a gift.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.419
It's a real gift.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.254
I mean, from the top to the bottom.

19:32.337 --> 19:35.507
Okay, the very bottom is so--

19:36.842 --> 19:38.468
And I'm really good with wood.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.304
I mean, so good with wood.

19:40.804 --> 19:43.807
I mean, like, how much wood
would a woodchuck chuck?

19:43.891 --> 19:45.726
I know, 'cause I can chuck it.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.520
So…

19:49.313 --> 19:51.398
So you just let me know, okay?

19:51.481 --> 19:54.401
Hey, why don't we have a drink
at the hotel bar

19:54.484 --> 19:57.446
to celebrate finding the perfect apartment
in one day?

19:57.529 --> 20:01.033
I wish I could, but I have calls to make
and a very early flight back.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.492
Oh, okay.

20:04.786 --> 20:07.331
<i>Ciao, bella.</i> It was a delight
to spend the day with you.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.457
Oh!

20:09.124 --> 20:10.000
Michael.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.878
<i>-Ciao.</i>
<i>-Ciao.</i>

20:12.961 --> 20:14.796
<i>Ciao.</i> <i>Ciao.</i>

20:14.880 --> 20:15.881
God damn it.

20:16.673 --> 20:21.303
Well, I guess it's for the best,
right? Client and all.

20:21.386 --> 20:25.098
Yeah. You know, I only live a couple
of blocks away, and it's nice outside.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.642
-I'm just gonna walk.
-Uh-huh.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.104
Hey, Kai. Yeah, I'm on my way home.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.690
Want me to pick up dinner?

20:34.816 --> 20:38.487
I don't know. I've been in the mood
for Italian all day.

20:39.613 --> 20:40.572
Damn!

20:41.240 --> 20:42.658
<i>Entrare.</i> Come in.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.664
This is crazy on so many levels.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.959
I don't fool around like this in Italy.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.586
But in New York,
I like to have a little fun.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.507
Especially with a hot all-American
like you.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.057
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just…

21:07.891 --> 21:11.395
I just got out of a 17-year relationship
really, like, just last week,

21:11.478 --> 21:13.814
and I haven't been with anyone else yet.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.358
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.735
-It's okay. I understand.
-All right.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.113
We can go down to the bar
and have a drink.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.155
That…

21:22.823 --> 21:24.283
Let me just change my shirt.

21:29.204 --> 21:30.163
Yeah, I'm ready.

21:57.274 --> 22:00.777
I wish I smoked.
I would totally smoke right now.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.821
It's a non-smoking room.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.282
No, I wouldn't really smoke.Eww!

22:05.907 --> 22:11.663
I mean, I just feel like I should
mark this moment with something… new,

22:11.747 --> 22:13.290
something I haven't done before.

22:13.790 --> 22:16.209
Isn't this something
you haven't done before?

22:18.337 --> 22:19.379
I guess it is.

22:20.297 --> 22:23.342
It's kind of how I imagined it, too,
the first time.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.053
-Well, I'm honored.
-Mm!

22:26.845 --> 22:28.555
I wasn't sure if you were into me.

22:29.056 --> 22:32.267
-Then, you show me a dick pic. It was--
-Oh my God.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.270
That was so embarrassing.
I was hoping you hadn't noticed.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.856
-You didn't mean for me to see it?
-No! Are you kidding?

22:37.939 --> 22:39.232
-No!
-Oh! Mamma mia.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.734
-What?

22:40.817 --> 22:44.613
I took it really fast 'cause my friends
said I had to have one on Grindr,

22:44.696 --> 22:46.907
-which I just got on yesterday.
-Mm.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.826
So, jackpot, by the way.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.622
<i>Molto gentile.</i>

22:53.705 --> 22:54.790
-Mm!
-Mm!

22:55.457 --> 22:57.959
Actually, the photo doesn't do it justice.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.171
-It's much better in person.
-Oh, thank you.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.299
Thank you.
It's been a bit of a recluse lately,

23:04.383 --> 23:07.886
so I'm not really sure
how it's gonna do out in the world.

23:07.969 --> 23:10.305
Plus, I'd never taken a dick pic,
so I had no idea--

23:10.389 --> 23:11.723
I can take it for you.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.726
I can light it at the perfect angle.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.604
I will send you to the Grindr-verse
with a pic…

23:19.481 --> 23:22.442
…I call worthy of such a beautiful dick.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.861
-You're amazing.

23:24.945 --> 23:28.281
Okay. Might have to wait a little bit
before it gets hard again, but--

23:28.365 --> 23:29.366
Mm-hmm?

23:30.867 --> 23:32.494
It's not… It's…

23:37.582 --> 23:40.001
Oh, well, that's a new personal best.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.036
So glad you stopped by.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.872
Our pleasure. Thanks for inviting us.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.623
-Really interesting stuff.
-Mm.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.417
-Oh, I just gotta lock up in back.
-Okay.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.752
But I'll see you again soon,
I hope!

24:25.380 --> 24:27.799
Oh my God. Kurt, Stephanie, hi.

24:28.592 --> 24:29.926
-So good to see you.
-Kurt! Hi!

24:30.010 --> 24:31.178
Hi.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.263
-So sorry to hear about you guys.
-Ah…

24:33.346 --> 24:36.641
We were gonna reach out. Even though,
technically, we're Colin's friends,

24:36.725 --> 24:38.185
obviously, we care about you too.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.437
Oh, I know. Thank you.
What brings you to the gallery?

24:40.520 --> 24:43.857
Oh, Stanley mentioned the show to us,
and thought we might like the artist.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.693
I didn't know you knew Stanley.
Did you meet at Colin's 50th?

24:46.776 --> 24:50.322
Yes, and then we saw each other again
last night at Colin's new apartment.

24:50.405 --> 24:51.531
He had a little dinner party.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.371
-Anyway, it's really good to see you.
-Take care, Mike.

24:59.414 --> 25:00.499
Yeah, yeah.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.961
Michael, I was gonna tell you.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.046
Tell me what?

25:06.963 --> 25:10.550
That you went to a fucking
dinner party at his new apartment?

25:11.635 --> 25:14.763
That he made
his special <i>linguine alle vongole,</i>

25:14.846 --> 25:17.682
which I'm sure he served
in the Williams-Sonoma pasta bowls,

25:17.766 --> 25:18.683
which I bought,

25:18.767 --> 25:21.186
and in what is becoming
a daily occurrence,

25:21.269 --> 25:22.854
just realized are gone?

25:23.897 --> 25:25.148
How could you do that, Stanley?

25:25.815 --> 25:27.817
-He reached out, so I--
-No!

25:27.901 --> 25:29.903
No. He does not get to reach out.

25:29.986 --> 25:33.657
He has lost all reaching out privileges,
which you should have told him,

25:33.740 --> 25:36.034
or, better yet, not reached back.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.702
Just ghosted him, like he did me.

25:37.786 --> 25:38.954
Michael, please.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.206
I've known him all these years.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.961
I just wanted to find out his side.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.671
His side?

25:47.754 --> 25:51.466
His side is that he is a sociopath

25:51.550 --> 25:55.762
who walked out on a 17-year relationship
without telling me.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.974
You're supposed to be <i>my</i> friend.

25:59.057 --> 26:03.144
And Colin, despite his dinner parties
and his fucking reaching out,

26:03.228 --> 26:04.729
is a very bad person.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.233
Or maybe he's a good person
who did a very bad thing.

26:08.316 --> 26:09.484
To me!

26:10.151 --> 26:13.238
He did a very bad thing to me,
your friend.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.115
You don't get to have pasta with him

26:15.198 --> 26:18.952
a week after he told me it was over
in a text!

26:20.704 --> 26:22.247
It actually wasn't pasta.

26:22.747 --> 26:25.125
I can't believe I'm even
having this conversation with you.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.460
It's not a conversation.
You're not letting me--

26:27.544 --> 26:30.547
You can't be friends with both of us,
Stanley. You have to pick.

26:31.131 --> 26:34.926
Uh-- Of course I'm your friend first, but…

26:37.178 --> 26:38.680
I shouldn't have to pick.

26:43.059 --> 26:44.227
You just did.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.480
Uh--
