<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:02.443 --> 00:04.962
You are looking through
a window into another world.

00:05.248 --> 00:07.705
An alternate universe,
just like ours

00:07.853 --> 00:10.634
and in each of them,
there is a version of us.

00:10.869 --> 00:12.706
I can't let Peter die again.

00:12.757 --> 00:14.508
Walter, Peter is dead.

00:14.575 --> 00:15.742
I'm talking
about the other Peter.

00:15.793 --> 00:18.095
The one on the other side.

00:20.798 --> 00:22.933
Thrust into another universe,

00:23.017 --> 00:25.185
and took a son
that wasn't mine.

00:25.252 --> 00:27.604
I'm going to be
waiting for you right here

00:27.672 --> 00:30.924
- bring him back to me.
- I promise.

00:30.975 --> 00:34.044
Hold on tight, son.

00:34.112 --> 00:36.763
You're not my father, are you?

00:36.814 --> 00:39.583
Of course I am.

Peter.

01:07.127 --> 01:09.846
Peter?
Darling, it's lunch.

01:48.936 --> 01:50.353
Peter!

02:02.033 --> 02:04.651
Peter!

02:04.702 --> 02:06.519
Peter!

02:13.694 --> 02:14.878
Peter!

02:16.697 --> 02:18.298
Oh, God!
Peter!

02:18.365 --> 02:19.883
Oh, God!

02:19.967 --> 02:22.035
No! Peter, no, please!

02:22.086 --> 02:25.138
No!

02:25.205 --> 02:26.907
Peter, please!
Oh, God, please.

02:26.974 --> 02:28.541
No!

02:28.593 --> 02:29.759
Please don't.

02:29.844 --> 02:31.895
Oh, please...

02:31.979 --> 02:34.014
Oh, no!

02:34.065 --> 02:35.065
Oh, no!

02:59.423 --> 03:00.907
Aah!

03:00.958 --> 03:02.241
Get off of me!

03:02.293 --> 03:03.593
- You're not my mother!
- Oh, God!

03:03.678 --> 03:05.262
I want to go home!

03:05.346 --> 03:08.932
Stop! You're not my mother!
I want to go home!

03:32.122 --> 03:35.008
Okay, children, let's begin.

03:35.075 --> 03:38.962
That's it.
Now, close your eyes.

03:39.046 --> 03:42.382
I want you to ignore everything
except the sound of my voice.

03:42.433 --> 03:45.385
Try to relax.
Clear your minds.

03:45.436 --> 03:47.920
We discussed
that your imagination

03:47.972 --> 03:49.522
can take you
anywhere you want to go.

03:49.589 --> 03:52.892
- What's wrong?
- I don't know what Snuggles will do...

03:52.943 --> 03:55.111
If we go somewhere.

03:55.195 --> 03:57.280
Just... Put him on your feet

03:57.364 --> 03:58.865
and he'll come with us, Nick.

03:58.932 --> 04:01.534
Olivia, how can you concentrate
if you're talking?

04:01.601 --> 04:03.703
Now, close your eyes, dear.

04:05.489 --> 04:08.207
Now, concentrate.

04:08.275 --> 04:10.609
Imagine this world...
slipping away.

04:10.661 --> 04:11.794
Excuse me, Dr. Bishop.

04:11.879 --> 04:13.279
Your wife is on the phone.

04:13.330 --> 04:15.882
Tell her I'll call her
back later.

04:15.949 --> 04:18.301
Well, she said to tell you
that she's here...

04:18.385 --> 04:20.353
In Jacksonville.

04:22.890 --> 04:24.307
Is it Thursday, Miss Ashley?

04:24.391 --> 04:26.893
Isn't Thursday
early day this week?

04:26.960 --> 04:28.594
Ha ha ha ho!

04:28.646 --> 04:31.648
Well, I'm gonna go home,
and you can too!

04:31.732 --> 04:32.982
- Yay!
- Okay, guys.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.150
Get your backpacks, okay?

04:34.234 --> 04:35.801
Ben, yours is
in the corner there,

04:35.853 --> 04:40.189
and, Jen, don't forget your
violin on purpose again, okay?

04:48.482 --> 04:52.001
Where is he?

04:53.653 --> 04:55.588
Of course the Dodgers
play for Los Angeles.

04:55.656 --> 04:57.090
No, they don't.

04:57.157 --> 04:58.791
They play in Brooklyn,
and I've seen them.

04:58.842 --> 05:02.045
And the Red Lantern
isn't supposed to be green.

05:02.112 --> 05:05.548
I've never had
a baseball mitt before... Never.

05:05.632 --> 05:08.301
Peter, you were very sick
for a very long time.

05:08.352 --> 05:11.504
It must have confused you,
mixed up your memories, son.

05:11.555 --> 05:12.805
Do not call me that.

05:12.856 --> 05:14.057
- Hey, hey...
- I am not your son!

05:14.141 --> 05:16.025
You are not my father!

05:16.110 --> 05:18.061
And she is not my mother!

05:18.145 --> 05:20.012
- You are not my father!
- Hey, hey...

05:20.064 --> 05:22.181
- Get off of me!
- Hey, hey, hey...

05:22.232 --> 05:24.901
You're not my mother!
I want to go home!

05:37.364 --> 05:38.881
He's asleep.

05:46.457 --> 05:48.674
We can't keep this up.

05:48.726 --> 05:50.576
It's making him crazy.

05:50.644 --> 05:53.730
What's the alternative?

05:53.814 --> 05:56.833
Tell him the truth?
He'd be locked up.

05:56.900 --> 05:59.769
These lies were supposed
to be a temporary measure.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.421
We were supposed
to have him home

06:01.488 --> 06:02.922
well before it got this far.

06:02.990 --> 06:05.525
It's been six months, Walter.

06:05.576 --> 06:07.210
Getting him back wasn't
as simple as I'd hoped.

06:07.277 --> 06:09.728
You're working,
but I'm with him.

06:09.780 --> 06:10.947
Elizabeth,
I think this series...

06:11.031 --> 06:14.117
I'm with him all the time.

06:14.201 --> 06:16.753
I can't watch him
suffer like this.

06:16.837 --> 06:20.373
What if...
If you made a device

06:20.424 --> 06:23.209
like the one you used
to bring him over?

06:23.277 --> 06:25.044
Elizabeth,
we have been through this.

06:25.112 --> 06:27.430
That would be catastrophic.

06:27.514 --> 06:31.601
The texture of the universe
has changed from my crossing.

06:31.685 --> 06:33.586
It cannot withstand
any more damage.

06:33.637 --> 06:35.822
Neither can he, Walter.

06:35.889 --> 06:38.274
He is in such distress.

06:38.358 --> 06:41.727
He... He looks at me,
and he doesn't trust me.

06:41.779 --> 06:44.597
I'm his mother,
but no matter what I say, he...

06:44.648 --> 06:48.401
Elizabeth, Elizabeth,
you are not his mother.

06:48.452 --> 06:49.569
He's a little boy

06:49.620 --> 06:51.788
very much like our son...

06:51.872 --> 06:53.990
And we saved his life.

06:54.074 --> 06:56.275
No, you... You...
You saved his life.

06:56.326 --> 06:59.945
I'm just trying
to keep him alive.

06:59.997 --> 07:02.298
I won't keep lying
to him like this.

07:02.382 --> 07:04.300
- Elizabeth...
- It's not fantasy.

07:04.384 --> 07:07.637
I can't keep him safe
if he doesn't trust me.

07:07.721 --> 07:11.557
Please...
Just a little more time.

07:11.625 --> 07:13.292
I told you...

07:13.343 --> 07:15.344
I think the children
are the key.

07:15.412 --> 07:17.380
The children should be able
to cross over,

07:17.448 --> 07:18.848
and when they do,

07:18.932 --> 07:23.569
they can take Peter
safely home with them.

07:23.637 --> 07:25.905
He... He can ride on their feet.

07:27.941 --> 07:31.894
Just give me a little
more time, please.

07:46.927 --> 07:49.178
Damn it, Olivia.

07:49.263 --> 07:50.713
When I say go to bed,

07:50.797 --> 07:53.633
I mean go to bed!

07:53.684 --> 07:54.884
Don't you run from me!

07:54.968 --> 07:56.552
Come here!

07:56.637 --> 07:57.970
Get your butt back in...

08:08.815 --> 08:10.666
...ever run from me!

08:14.635 --> 08:17.470
Hey, I'm really glad
you got some sleep.

08:20.725 --> 08:21.725
Peter.

08:25.513 --> 08:27.213
Do you really think
I don't know

08:27.264 --> 08:29.099
that you're not my mother?

08:29.183 --> 08:32.686
- Please, can we just, uh...
- You think I can't tell?

08:32.736 --> 08:34.104
Peter, how many more questions

08:34.188 --> 08:36.206
am I gonna have to get right
before you believe me?

08:36.273 --> 08:39.325
We've been doing this routine
for two months now.

08:39.393 --> 08:40.909
I told you the name
of your hamster.

08:40.995 --> 08:42.412
- I told you...
- You got some wrong.

08:42.496 --> 08:45.115
Yes. And maybe that's
because you're confused

08:45.199 --> 08:46.766
because you were so ill.

08:46.834 --> 08:49.902
He makes you say that,
doesn't he?

08:49.954 --> 08:52.489
'Cause he's the one
who stole me.

08:55.209 --> 08:56.843
Stole you from where, Peter?

08:59.597 --> 09:02.282
From the other world
at the bottom of the lake.

09:03.884 --> 09:04.818
Love...

09:04.885 --> 09:06.603
I know that I sound crazy.

09:08.472 --> 09:12.025
But I'm not, okay?

09:12.092 --> 09:14.677
I'm not crazy.

09:20.484 --> 09:22.052
So let's just, um...

09:22.119 --> 09:24.771
let's just get out
of the house today, baby, okay?

09:24.822 --> 09:27.907
Let's just, um,
get some air.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.336
You look gray,

09:40.421 --> 09:42.789
which is not technically
a skin color.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.007
Another sleepless night?

09:44.091 --> 09:45.291
Yes, I suppose so.

09:45.342 --> 09:47.143
Look, I'm not finished
with these.

09:47.228 --> 09:48.595
I want to organize
a subgroup data.

09:48.646 --> 09:49.846
- So if you don't mind...
- There's no need.

09:49.930 --> 09:52.849
I have something else
in mind.

09:52.933 --> 09:54.934
This is not working.
I want to separate the children

09:54.985 --> 09:56.152
and begin independent testing.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.403
Okay, well,
any particular order?

09:57.471 --> 10:00.156
What's Olivia doing inside?

10:00.224 --> 10:04.527
Well, she didn't have
a very good night either.

10:04.612 --> 10:07.080
Olivia, why don't you
go outside

10:07.147 --> 10:09.148
and play with the others?

10:18.793 --> 10:21.461
Olive, what happened
to your eye?

10:23.097 --> 10:26.499
Ashley said that you told her
that you fell.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.436
Running in my house.

10:34.775 --> 10:36.943
Olive, you can trust me.

10:37.010 --> 10:41.064
- If someone is hurting you...
- I said I fell, okay?

10:41.148 --> 10:43.349
I fell.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.235
That's all.

10:54.829 --> 10:56.045
May I?

11:02.586 --> 11:05.388
Olive, why did you
draw this?

11:07.374 --> 11:09.809
Did you see it in a book?

11:12.429 --> 11:14.614
Where, then?

11:19.052 --> 11:23.823
Was it last night...
when you fell?

11:35.786 --> 11:38.404
You know tulips don't usually
grow in areas like this.

11:38.455 --> 11:40.373
Well, then what
are they doing here?

11:40.424 --> 11:42.342
A professor who was
working here missed them,

11:42.409 --> 11:44.961
so he imagined a tulip
that would grow in this climate,

11:45.045 --> 11:47.213
and he invented it.

11:47.264 --> 11:49.182
He used his brain
and his imagination

11:49.249 --> 11:52.051
to turn the world
into what he wanted it to be.

11:52.102 --> 11:56.105
How would you change
the world if you could, Peter?

11:56.190 --> 11:58.224
What would you wish for?

11:58.275 --> 12:00.426
I wouldn't make
stupid flowers grow.

12:00.477 --> 12:03.429
What would you do?

12:05.149 --> 12:06.599
I'd go home.

12:13.958 --> 12:16.826
A couple of more errands,
and...

12:16.911 --> 12:20.079
Then I've got a surprise
in store for you.

12:24.385 --> 12:25.385
Peter.

12:32.343 --> 12:33.610
Now, listen,

12:33.677 --> 12:37.296
can I trust you
not to run off on me?

12:37.348 --> 12:39.432
Okay.
Go and pick a toy, then.

12:39.483 --> 12:42.018
Go on.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.802
Ooh, that's a strange game.

13:15.853 --> 13:17.303
What's that called?

13:17.354 --> 13:19.505
It's called Joust.

14:00.681 --> 14:02.348
I suspect her crossing over

14:02.399 --> 14:05.485
was triggered by
an extreme emotional response.

14:05.552 --> 14:06.736
Her black eye.

14:06.820 --> 14:10.656
So, now we need to design
a series of experiments

14:10.724 --> 14:12.058
around emotional flexibility.

14:12.109 --> 14:14.027
Hey.

14:14.078 --> 14:16.329
I wanted to show Peter
where you worked.

14:22.503 --> 14:24.754
Hey, Peter!
Hey.

14:24.838 --> 14:26.756
Look at that airplane.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.424
That's, um...

14:28.509 --> 14:30.343
A DC-3, yeah?

14:32.262 --> 14:34.931
Aha. The beguiling
Olivia Dunham beguiles.

14:35.015 --> 14:37.016
Listen, Peter,
I was about to go and get a snack.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.585
Would you like to, uh,
come with me and get something?

14:39.636 --> 14:41.587
- Yeah, go on, Peter.
- Okay.

14:41.638 --> 14:44.590
Come on, let's go.

14:44.641 --> 14:46.893
We've had
a promising development.

14:46.944 --> 14:50.696
I think young Olivia
may have crossed over.

14:50.764 --> 14:52.281
And if I'm right
and she has...

14:52.366 --> 14:55.401
Then she can take Peter home.

14:55.452 --> 14:57.403
I knew you'd find a way.

14:57.454 --> 14:59.355
Well, I still have
to work out

14:59.423 --> 15:01.407
precisely how she does it.

15:01.458 --> 15:05.161
But we're nearly there.

15:17.114 --> 15:20.332
William, I need your help.

15:20.384 --> 15:23.686
I have reason to believe
subject 13, Olivia Dunham,

15:23.770 --> 15:27.006
has been able to cross over
to the other side.

15:27.057 --> 15:29.976
But I believe
that young Olivia may need

15:30.027 --> 15:32.845
to be in some kind
of heightened emotional state

15:32.896 --> 15:35.781
to access her ability.

15:35.849 --> 15:38.150
I'm compiling some recordings

15:38.201 --> 15:40.286
on my new Betamax.

15:40.353 --> 15:44.106
Perhaps you'll be able to see
something I cannot.

15:48.361 --> 15:50.379
<i>Okay, Olivia.</i>

15:50.464 --> 15:51.881
<i>You feeling comfortable?</i>

15:51.965 --> 15:53.082
<i>I'm fine.</i>

15:53.166 --> 15:55.334
<i>These wires</i>

15:55.385 --> 15:57.920
<i>will show me
how you respond to the tests.</i>

15:58.005 --> 15:58.971
<i>I'll just...</i>

15:59.039 --> 16:02.592
<i>Ashley.
Uh, test series alpha.</i>

16:02.676 --> 16:05.928
<i>I'll be monitoring vitals,
theta rhythms,</i>

16:06.013 --> 16:07.813
<i>stable neocortex.</i>

16:07.881 --> 16:09.231
<i>Okay.</i>

16:14.387 --> 16:16.555
<i>Well, you're doing
very well there, Olive.</i>

16:16.607 --> 16:21.444
<i>Now, these four brothers
grew up to be great warriors.</i>

16:21.528 --> 16:23.029
<i>They were very special</i>

16:23.080 --> 16:27.750
<i>because they had the power
of metamorphosis.</i>

16:27.834 --> 16:30.369
- Metamorphosis?
- Mm-hmm.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.321
<i>Ah...</i>

16:32.389 --> 16:35.124
<i>He could turn into...</i>

16:35.208 --> 16:36.676
<i>A hawk,</i>

16:36.743 --> 16:40.179
<i>watching for invaders
from on high.</i>

16:40.247 --> 16:43.299
<i>The speed of a cheetah and...</i>

16:43.383 --> 16:45.351
<i>The fire of a dragon!</i>

16:48.388 --> 16:50.606
<i>Minimal response to joy.</i>

16:50.691 --> 16:52.692
<i>Theta rhythms
show a slight bump</i>

16:52.759 --> 16:54.477
<i>but not
within our range.</i>

16:54.561 --> 16:56.062
<i>Can I stop now?</i>

16:56.113 --> 16:58.731
<i>Not yet, dear.
You need to keep going.</i>

17:03.487 --> 17:05.070
<i>A little longer, Olivia.</i>

17:05.122 --> 17:06.605
<i>You're doing really well.</i>

17:11.994 --> 17:15.164
<i>Heart rate 140 beats
per minute for 30 minutes.</i>

17:15.248 --> 17:17.083
<i>No response to exhilaration.</i>

17:21.338 --> 17:22.972
<i>You'll have to start over.</i>

17:23.056 --> 17:25.758
<i>- It doesn't fit.
- Try it.</i>

17:25.809 --> 17:28.928
<i>Look at each piece carefully.</i>

17:31.481 --> 17:33.099
<i>No. You'll have
to start again.</i>

17:33.150 --> 17:37.319
<i>- It doesn't fit, Dr. Walter...
- Try it.</i>

17:37.387 --> 17:39.321
<i>Faster.</i>

17:39.406 --> 17:42.108
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

17:42.159 --> 17:43.659
<i>That's wrong.</i>

17:43.744 --> 17:45.411
<i>That's wrong.</i>

17:45.478 --> 17:48.864
<i>That's wrong.
Concentrate, Olivia!</i>

17:48.949 --> 17:50.366
<i>No!</i>

17:50.450 --> 17:54.120
<i>I'm not working
on this anymore!</i>

17:54.187 --> 17:56.672
<i>Minimal activity
in the stable neocortex.</i>

17:56.757 --> 17:58.724
<i>Anger isn't the answer.</i>

18:10.804 --> 18:14.557
<i>Loneliness isn't
the answer either.</i>

18:17.310 --> 18:20.179
<i>Perhaps fear...</i>

18:20.230 --> 18:21.697
<i>Show you a movie.</i>

18:21.782 --> 18:24.083
<i>It's one of my favorites.
It's called Jaws.</i>

18:24.151 --> 18:26.018
<i>It's...
It's a bit scary,</i>

18:26.069 --> 18:28.320
<i>but I think you can handle it.</i>

18:31.958 --> 18:34.160
<i>Um... Sorry.</i>

18:38.415 --> 18:40.082
<i>That's all right.</i>

18:40.167 --> 18:41.834
<i>Ready to start the movie?</i>

18:41.885 --> 18:44.253
<i>No, no, no.
Um...</i>

18:44.337 --> 18:46.806
<i>No, let's...
Let's take a little break.</i>

18:46.873 --> 18:48.390
<i>Let's get that off you.
You don't need that.</i>

18:48.475 --> 18:51.010
It started to
occur to me, William,

18:51.077 --> 18:54.180
that fear by itself
wasn't the answer.

19:22.492 --> 19:24.393
Walter?

19:24.461 --> 19:27.463
Let me out!
Please, let me out!

19:33.870 --> 19:36.755
Who's there?
Is someone there?

19:36.807 --> 19:39.425
Aah!

19:46.551 --> 19:48.935
Approaching the building,
requesting clearance to dock.

20:09.690 --> 20:12.709
Love, come and get
your coat, will you?

20:17.999 --> 20:21.518
I don't think olive thought
the joke was very funny.

20:21.586 --> 20:23.003
No, I suppose not.

20:23.054 --> 20:24.037
There you go.

20:24.088 --> 20:25.538
Nick, would you please
wait outside

20:25.590 --> 20:27.540
with the other children?
Thank you.

20:27.592 --> 20:28.875
Dr. Bishop...
just a minute, Ashley.

20:28.926 --> 20:31.027
We're obviously
on the right track.

20:31.095 --> 20:33.480
The part of Olivia's brain
that let her do this

20:33.547 --> 20:35.515
must be the same part

20:35.583 --> 20:39.770
that lets her cross
between universes.

20:39.854 --> 20:42.072
But I'm still missing
something.

20:42.140 --> 20:45.192
Dr. Bishop,
we have another problem.

20:45.243 --> 20:47.727
Let's get your backpack on,
okay?

20:47.779 --> 20:48.779
Good night.

20:48.863 --> 20:50.914
Ashley...
What's going on?

20:50.998 --> 20:52.899
There's been a small fire,

20:52.950 --> 20:54.868
but everything's under control.

20:54.919 --> 20:56.837
Ashley.

20:59.423 --> 21:00.924
One of the children
has gone missing...

21:01.008 --> 21:02.575
a girl, Olivia Dunham.

21:02.627 --> 21:03.910
Now, your husband
and the others

21:03.961 --> 21:05.245
are out looking for her,
and I'm sure

21:05.296 --> 21:06.880
that everything's
gonna be fine.

21:06.931 --> 21:09.249
Okay. All right.
Thank you.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.718
Peter, come on.
Come inside with me.

21:15.106 --> 21:18.424
Peter, will you wait here
for me for a minute?

21:18.476 --> 21:21.111
Okay. Good boy.
I'll be back in a second.

22:28.713 --> 22:29.846
Elizabeth.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.164
Did you find her?

22:31.215 --> 22:33.166
No, we haven't yet.

22:33.217 --> 22:34.551
This little girl, Olivia...

22:34.635 --> 22:37.971
Walter, it says that you think
her stepfather's hitting her.

22:38.022 --> 22:40.023
I...

22:40.107 --> 22:42.559
"William, I believe
the ideal environment

22:42.643 --> 22:44.477
"for transition
across universes

22:44.528 --> 22:46.646
"may be a return to her home.

22:46.697 --> 22:49.115
"The unique combination
of love and terror there

22:49.183 --> 22:51.084
apparently stimulates
a cortical reaction."

22:51.152 --> 22:53.203
A: They are notes.

22:55.940 --> 22:58.491
And B: Yes.

22:58.559 --> 23:01.544
The unique combination
of love and terror

23:01.629 --> 23:03.663
does stimulate
a cortical reaction

23:03.731 --> 23:06.549
that may be the key
to her crossing over.

23:06.634 --> 23:10.136
And if she is not allowed
to return to her home

23:10.204 --> 23:12.672
to re-stimulate the pathways...

23:12.723 --> 23:15.175
what, you mean
to be terrorized again?

23:15.226 --> 23:16.542
Then it could well
take me years

23:16.594 --> 23:19.712
to simulate the state
artificially.

23:19.764 --> 23:22.349
Walter, you said that
this was just a theory.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.352
Surely there's got to be
some other way.

23:25.403 --> 23:27.570
And if there isn't?

23:33.727 --> 23:38.114
This is not about you and me
and Peter anymore.

23:38.199 --> 23:40.784
Don't you see what I've done?

23:40.868 --> 23:48.574
I crept over in the night...
and I stole their child.

23:48.626 --> 23:50.260
If we don't return him,

23:50.344 --> 23:52.345
they'll figure it out,
and they'll come after him,

23:52.413 --> 23:54.431
after us...
I know...

23:54.515 --> 23:58.218
because that's what I would do.

23:58.269 --> 24:01.187
So you would sacrifice
one for the other...

24:01.255 --> 24:03.156
This little girl Olivia
for Peter?

24:03.224 --> 24:04.975
No.

24:06.711 --> 24:09.729
But for thousands of others...

24:09.780 --> 24:11.414
Or millions,

24:11.482 --> 24:13.450
it would have to be considered.

24:13.534 --> 24:15.118
Walter...

24:16.537 --> 24:17.570
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:17.621 --> 24:19.239
I was looking for Peter.

24:19.290 --> 24:20.824
He told me he's never had
Peanut M&Ms before.

24:20.908 --> 24:23.276
Oh, he's out by the cubbies.

24:23.327 --> 24:24.661
No, I just looked there.

24:39.593 --> 24:41.127
Peter?

24:45.649 --> 24:48.318
Peter?

24:56.694 --> 24:59.863
<i>It's been six months
since Peter Bishop disappeared,</i>

24:59.947 --> 25:01.998
<i>but authorities
still have no ideas.</i>

25:02.083 --> 25:05.168
<i>The sympathy of the world
goes out to Dr. Walter Bishop</i>

25:05.252 --> 25:07.487
<i>and his devoted wife,
as the entire nation</i>

25:07.538 --> 25:09.756
<i>remains aghast at the kidnapping
of their only son.</i>

25:09.824 --> 25:11.825
<i>Dr. Bishop,
the architect of the famed</i>

25:11.892 --> 25:14.677
<i>Star Wars defense system
that protects our nation,</i>

25:14.762 --> 25:16.679
<i>and his wife
made an emot...</i>

25:16.764 --> 25:18.131
This isn't doing you any good.

25:18.199 --> 25:19.716
Don't turn it off now.

25:19.784 --> 25:23.219
They're about to point out
how ironic it is...

25:23.304 --> 25:28.691
That the safety czar
couldn't protect his own child.

25:28.776 --> 25:30.510
Walter, I'm serious.

25:30.561 --> 25:32.979
You can't keep doing this.

25:33.030 --> 25:35.532
You can't keep drinking
yourself into oblivion.

25:35.616 --> 25:38.401
Do you have a better suggestion
about what I should be doing?

25:38.469 --> 25:41.154
Well, not this.

25:41.222 --> 25:43.807
Should I give up on my son...

25:43.874 --> 25:47.243
The way the police
seem to have?

26:06.275 --> 26:07.959
Dinner's ready in twenty.

26:08.026 --> 26:10.628
I'm not hungry.

26:10.696 --> 26:12.130
That's fine.

26:12.197 --> 26:13.465
You still need to eat.

26:13.532 --> 26:14.666
If nothing else,

26:14.717 --> 26:16.701
you need to put something
in your stomach

26:16.752 --> 26:19.087
to absorb all that alcohol.

26:19.171 --> 26:22.457
You said he was wearing
a beige sweater.

26:22.525 --> 26:23.908
The man who took my son...

26:23.976 --> 26:26.277
you said he was wearing
a beige sweater,

26:26.345 --> 26:27.929
not a suit like I would wear.

26:28.013 --> 26:29.881
- Walter, please don't do this.
- How did he sound?

26:29.932 --> 26:31.065
His voice?

26:31.150 --> 26:33.284
I have a new theory...
Plastic surgery.

26:33.352 --> 26:35.270
There are a handful of surgeons

26:35.354 --> 26:38.273
skilled enough to pull off
a feat of this magnitude,

26:38.357 --> 26:40.892
but the voice...
The voice would be tricky.

26:40.943 --> 26:44.446
You know what?
Maybe it was plastic surgery...

26:44.513 --> 26:47.231
Or an alien able to take on
any shape he wanted.

26:47.283 --> 26:50.351
We've considered
all your theories, Walter,

26:50.419 --> 26:52.754
and none of them
have brought our son back.

26:52.822 --> 26:54.339
It happened.

26:54.406 --> 26:57.909
It just happened,
and it's inexplicable.

27:05.083 --> 27:08.386
Nothing is inexplicable,
Elizabeth.

27:08.437 --> 27:11.523
Science is seen as magic
by primitives.

27:11.590 --> 27:13.358
Something happened
in this house,

27:13.425 --> 27:14.776
and we have to go over it

27:14.860 --> 27:17.595
and over it until we find out
what we're missing.

27:17.646 --> 27:19.147
And how will this time
be any different?

27:19.231 --> 27:20.615
I don't know yet.
We have to go over it.

27:20.699 --> 27:22.867
I have, Walter.
I've thought back.

27:22.935 --> 27:25.153
I've gone over it
again and again.

27:25.237 --> 27:27.772
I have told you
and a dozen policemen

27:27.823 --> 27:30.492
every detail that I can
remember about that night.

27:30.576 --> 27:33.077
I've had hypnotherapy
to try and recover

27:33.128 --> 27:35.613
every detail I couldn't!

27:35.664 --> 27:37.298
I know.

27:37.383 --> 27:42.119
And I believe you...
about all of it.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.891
But there has to be
something we've overlooked.

27:46.959 --> 27:49.143
There has to be an explanation.

27:49.228 --> 27:50.795
You fly to Florida
every Monday.

27:50.846 --> 27:52.981
You work all week,
and then you come back,

27:53.065 --> 27:54.766
and we do this.

27:54.817 --> 27:56.751
This is not
a marriage anymore.

27:58.637 --> 28:00.522
It's a routine.

28:03.075 --> 28:04.526
Please, Elizabeth...

28:04.610 --> 28:07.412
One more time.

28:07.479 --> 28:10.147
He's my boy.

28:10.199 --> 28:13.034
I can't lose him.

28:57.029 --> 28:59.564
I'm so sorry, my love.

29:03.569 --> 29:06.554
I know I can't keep doing this.

29:13.796 --> 29:17.165
But it's impossible.

29:17.232 --> 29:20.835
- Impossible he's gone.
- I know.

29:20.903 --> 29:23.621
I know, Walter.

29:23.689 --> 29:28.476
I spend every waking moment
imagining where he is...

29:28.544 --> 29:31.362
What he's doing.

29:31.413 --> 29:35.833
And I pray that wherever he is,
he's safe...

29:35.901 --> 29:38.636
That someone's
taking good care of him...

29:38.704 --> 29:42.757
And that someday,
by some miracle,

29:42.841 --> 29:46.744
we'll get to see him again.

29:46.795 --> 29:49.547
But until that miracle happens,

29:49.598 --> 29:51.699
I can't break.

29:51.767 --> 29:53.551
I need to be here for him.

29:53.602 --> 29:55.320
We need to be here
for him.

29:55.387 --> 29:56.804
But we won't.

29:56.889 --> 29:59.774
Walter, we're breaking.

29:59.858 --> 30:02.610
Our marriage...
This is breaking us.

30:02.695 --> 30:06.331
And I can't let
that happen.

30:06.398 --> 30:09.266
I need you, my love.

30:09.318 --> 30:12.269
I've lost Peter.
I...

30:12.321 --> 30:14.789
I can't bear to lose you, too.

30:19.311 --> 30:20.828
Don't go to work tomorrow.

30:20.913 --> 30:23.014
Stay home this week.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.099
Forget the lab.
Forget Florida.

30:25.167 --> 30:27.518
Let's put our marriage
back together.

31:25.277 --> 31:27.678
Welcome back, sir.

31:36.739 --> 31:39.874
- Morning, Dr. Bishop.
- Morning.

32:17.996 --> 32:19.280
Dr. Bishop,
it's almost dark,

32:19.364 --> 32:22.467
and there's still
no sign of either of them.

32:22.534 --> 32:25.086
I found this.

32:25.170 --> 32:27.371
It's Olivia's.

32:49.017 --> 32:50.217
Hi.

32:53.187 --> 32:54.688
Hi.

32:56.757 --> 32:59.142
How'd you find me?

33:00.528 --> 33:03.763
I guess tulips don't
normally grow around here.

33:06.284 --> 33:07.701
But...

33:07.768 --> 33:09.403
How'd you know I'd come here?

33:14.575 --> 33:17.544
Because it's the only
drawing that looked happy.

33:20.465 --> 33:22.466
My name's Peter.

33:24.618 --> 33:26.470
Mine's Olivia.

33:28.973 --> 33:29.973
Don't...

33:31.843 --> 33:34.561
Be careful.

33:39.250 --> 33:41.435
I'm not scared.

33:48.993 --> 33:50.477
What happened?

33:53.247 --> 33:55.449
My step-dad did it.

34:01.089 --> 34:02.172
So...

34:02.256 --> 34:05.008
Everyone's looking for you.

34:08.513 --> 34:11.014
I messed up...

34:11.099 --> 34:15.217
And now he's gonna
send me home.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.887
Who?

34:16.971 --> 34:19.356
Dr. Walter.

34:24.277 --> 34:26.530
Did you tell him...

34:26.614 --> 34:29.199
Walter, I mean,
about your step-dad hitting you?

34:29.283 --> 34:32.202
I don't think it'd do anything.

34:32.286 --> 34:34.821
My mo...

34:40.495 --> 34:42.161
My mom was telling me

34:42.213 --> 34:46.132
you got to imagine
how you want things to be.

34:46.199 --> 34:48.502
And then you can try
and change them.

34:56.143 --> 34:58.711
Do you trust him...

34:58.763 --> 35:00.680
Walter?

35:04.485 --> 35:06.937
You should tell him.

35:11.659 --> 35:14.778
You got to try
something, right?

35:21.452 --> 35:23.787
I think I cooled off by now.

35:33.714 --> 35:37.217
Did you imagine that?

35:46.260 --> 35:47.894
No, the last time
we saw her was before 5:00.

35:47.945 --> 35:49.779
We went looking ourselves,
but then it got dark.

35:49.864 --> 35:51.731
And do your son
and the girl know each other?

35:51.782 --> 35:53.233
No. He...
He's not from here.

35:53.284 --> 35:54.901
He doesn't even know the area.

35:54.952 --> 35:56.203
Look!

35:56.270 --> 35:57.704
They're back.

35:57.771 --> 36:01.291
Oh, Peter!

36:03.377 --> 36:05.662
Oh, God!
We were worried sick about you.

36:05.746 --> 36:08.215
Are you all right?

36:08.282 --> 36:10.584
Huh? Yeah?

36:10.635 --> 36:12.052
Let's just
have her go inside.

36:12.119 --> 36:13.453
I don't know
what she's going through.

36:13.504 --> 36:14.804
I just want to check her.

36:14.889 --> 36:16.139
- Please.
- Okay.

36:16.224 --> 36:17.290
Okay, thank you.

36:17.341 --> 36:21.261
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.

36:22.413 --> 36:24.385
Come on.

36:29.937 --> 36:33.306
Okay, your step-father's
on his way.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.975
Olivia, sweetie,
we were all so worried about you.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.646
What were you thinking?

36:39.697 --> 36:41.648
I want to see Dr. Walter.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.149
Okay, you can see
him tomorrow, but...

36:43.200 --> 36:45.785
No! I have to see him now.

36:45.836 --> 36:47.921
Olivia, you can't see
him now, okay?

36:47.988 --> 36:49.506
Olivia, don't...

36:53.878 --> 36:56.630
My step-father did this.

36:56.681 --> 36:58.298
He hits me.

36:58.349 --> 37:02.168
That's when I crossed over
to the other universe.

37:07.391 --> 37:08.692
Look...

37:11.729 --> 37:14.064
That's where I saw the blimps,

37:14.148 --> 37:16.700
just like you said.

37:16.784 --> 37:22.238
They were in the sky
in the other universe.

37:22.323 --> 37:25.792
Can you make him
stop hitting me...

37:27.712 --> 37:30.046
Please?

37:32.416 --> 37:35.168
Olive?

37:37.088 --> 37:39.005
Olivia...

37:39.056 --> 37:41.391
What is it?
What's wrong?

38:09.537 --> 38:11.621
I'm sorry, Dr. Bishop.

38:11.706 --> 38:12.956
I hope our little princess

38:13.040 --> 38:14.424
hasn't caused you
too much trouble.

38:14.508 --> 38:15.542
No trouble at all.

38:15.593 --> 38:17.177
Come on, Olivia.

38:17.244 --> 38:18.911
I've been worried sick.

38:18.963 --> 38:22.132
Let's get you home.

38:22.216 --> 38:25.518
Before you go...

38:25.586 --> 38:27.854
I want you to understand

38:27.921 --> 38:31.808
that this girl
is very special to me,

38:31.892 --> 38:34.144
and if anything harmful
should happen to her,

38:34.228 --> 38:35.745
anything to frighten her

38:35.813 --> 38:39.282
or make her uncomfortable
in the least...

38:41.152 --> 38:46.239
I will not hesitate
to inform Social Services...

38:46.290 --> 38:48.458
In which case,

38:48.542 --> 38:50.877
I have certain
government friends

38:50.944 --> 38:53.630
who could ensure
that you will be facing

38:53.714 --> 38:55.765
significant troubles
for yourself.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.702
Do you understand me?

39:08.429 --> 39:10.346
Dear...

39:10.431 --> 39:12.565
You go home
and get some rest, huh?

39:12.633 --> 39:14.851
And...

39:14.935 --> 39:18.071
We'll see if we can figure out
a new way tomorrow.

39:18.138 --> 39:19.939
All right?

39:57.010 --> 39:59.011
I'm sorry.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.730
Hmm?

40:00.815 --> 40:04.234
When I ran off...
I'm sorry if I scared you.

40:04.318 --> 40:09.572
- Peter, it's...
- I'm never going back...

40:09.657 --> 40:12.308
Am I?

40:23.921 --> 40:25.755
Listen to me.

40:30.327 --> 40:35.515
Sometimes the world we have
is not the world we want.

40:35.566 --> 40:37.484
But we have our hearts
and our imaginations

40:37.551 --> 40:40.186
to make the best of it.

40:40.254 --> 40:43.156
I will promise you this.

40:43.223 --> 40:47.226
I will be the best mother
I possibly can be to you.

40:47.278 --> 40:51.898
I'll take care of you.
I'll protect you.

40:51.949 --> 40:55.502
And I'll never let anyone
take you away from me...

40:55.569 --> 40:57.069
No one...

40:57.121 --> 40:59.706
Not ever.

40:59.757 --> 41:03.226
But you're not her...

41:03.294 --> 41:04.761
Are you?

41:04.845 --> 41:07.714
You're not my real mother.

41:13.103 --> 41:16.689
You were sick.

41:16.757 --> 41:20.193
You were very sick
for a long, long time.

41:20.260 --> 41:24.931
And I think it confused you.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.816
Yes...

41:26.901 --> 41:30.770
I am your mother.
Of course I am.

41:41.281 --> 41:43.299
Now...

41:43.384 --> 41:47.387
You go off and wash
your hands for dinner, okay?

41:51.408 --> 41:53.459
Okay...

41:57.731 --> 41:59.566
Mom.

42:56.707 --> 42:58.041
<i>Hello?</i>

42:58.125 --> 43:00.026
Elizabeth, it's me.

43:00.077 --> 43:02.295
I know where our son is.

43:02.362 --> 43:04.614
I know where Peter was taken.
