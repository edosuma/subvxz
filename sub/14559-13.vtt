00:01.001 --> 00:04.438
* Ah-yoohoo, Ah-yoohoo,
Ah-yoohoo, Ah-yoohoo *

00:04.472 --> 00:06.440
(dog barking and growling)

00:06.474 --> 00:09.143
* Ah-yoohoo, Ah-yoohoo

00:09.177 --> 00:11.779
(barking)

00:11.812 --> 00:15.716
* Ah-yoohoo, Ah-yoohoo,
Ah-yoohoo, Ah-yoohoo *

00:15.749 --> 00:23.357
* Ah-yoohoo, Ah-yoohoo,
Ah-yoohoo, Ah-yoohoo *

00:23.391 --> 00:28.096
* Ah-yoohoo, Ah-yoohoo,
Ah-yoohoo, Ah-yoohoo... *

00:28.129 --> 00:32.600
Get the boys in. Let's go,
let's go. Hit it.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.103
CHARLIE:
The first thing I tell you

00:35.136 --> 00:37.071
is probably the most important
thing you'll hear today.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.140
If you take nothing else
away from this seminar--

00:39.173 --> 00:40.408
and you'd better take a lot more

00:40.441 --> 00:41.609
away from this seminar--

00:41.642 --> 00:43.411
I'll tell you that teaching

00:43.444 --> 00:44.512
is not about what you know.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.680
It's about how you lead.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.182
And of course,
you are all leaders here.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.818
Hit it! Hit it!

00:52.153 --> 00:54.288
(tires squealing)

01:00.394 --> 01:02.363
...marching your students
along a path

01:02.396 --> 01:04.165
to illumination
and intellectual

01:04.198 --> 01:05.633
independence, and that's a path

01:05.666 --> 01:07.535
known only to yourselves.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.538
Which means, you'd better have
a plan every single day.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.109
* A cold charisma

01:16.210 --> 01:18.146
* Shotgun wedding...

01:18.179 --> 01:20.614
AMITA: There are days when
you're going

01:20.648 --> 01:22.350
to feel intimidated,
especially at the beginning.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.618
You know, you'll feel like
you're losing control.

01:24.652 --> 01:25.686
(door bursts open)

01:25.719 --> 01:26.887
FBI! Get down!

01:26.920 --> 01:28.422
Go! Go!

01:28.456 --> 01:29.423
On your knees!

01:29.457 --> 01:31.125
Get down! Go! Go! You!

01:31.159 --> 01:32.326
(shouting)

01:32.360 --> 01:34.462
Let's go! Get down!
Let's go!

01:34.495 --> 01:38.199
You, on your knees!
On your knees!

01:38.232 --> 01:40.234
And that's why we're here--
to be your support system,

01:40.268 --> 01:41.202
to back you up.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.906
Don't move! Don't move! Get them
up!

01:45.939 --> 01:47.475
* And I'll sign something...

01:47.508 --> 01:49.477
DON: David, how we doing back
there?

01:49.510 --> 01:50.878
DAVID:
Clear in front, Don.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.913
All right, let's lock
this place up, guys! Let's go!

01:52.946 --> 01:54.648
Lock it up tight!

01:54.682 --> 01:56.550
You know, in teaching,
as well as in science,

01:56.584 --> 01:58.186
there is a place
for your instincts,

01:58.219 --> 02:00.521
so learn to listen to them,
learn to understand what

02:00.554 --> 02:01.689
they're telling you.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.791
* Blood confetti...

02:03.824 --> 02:06.460
Are we missing anyone?

02:06.494 --> 02:07.795
DAVID:
Negative.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.430
All 11 are under.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.932
* Ah-yoohoo, Ah-yoohoo,
Ah-yoohoo... *

02:11.965 --> 02:13.100
LARRY:
Frequently, intuition

02:13.133 --> 02:17.238
is simply your rational mind
finding an ineloquent way

02:17.271 --> 02:18.772
of talking to you.

02:18.806 --> 02:22.476
Hey, Colby, that guy in the red
flannel shirt that SWAT

02:22.510 --> 02:23.477
just turned around?

02:23.511 --> 02:25.579
Yeah, Don, he was parking
when we pulled up.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.281
- Bravo team says he checks out.
- DON: You know what?

02:27.315 --> 02:28.749
Pull that guy back.
I want to talk to him.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.750
All right, 10-4.

02:29.783 --> 02:30.551
CHARLIE:
Ultimately,

02:30.584 --> 02:32.486
the hallmark
of any good teacher,

02:32.520 --> 02:34.222
of any good leader,

02:34.255 --> 02:35.523
is his belief
in himself.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.590
You know,

02:36.624 --> 02:39.327
with that belief comes
the confidence of others.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.695
Of course, it doesn't hurt
being right.

02:42.963 --> 02:43.831
Hey, hold up

02:43.864 --> 02:45.766
for a second.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.902
Yeah, we got a runner
going east on Sixth!

02:48.936 --> 02:50.771
So, uh, any questions?

03:07.888 --> 03:09.590
(grunts)

03:09.623 --> 03:11.859
(panting)

03:11.892 --> 03:13.727
AMITA:
Wow.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.263
That was strange.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.464
Yeah.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.798
12 teaching assistants,

03:17.831 --> 03:18.966
and not a
single question.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.269
The silence was...
memorable.

03:21.302 --> 03:24.605
Hmm. And this from someone
who lives in a monastery.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.341
You know, I've done
countless T.A. orientations.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.243
That was a first.

03:29.277 --> 03:31.279
It's funny how the most routine
jobs can still surprise you.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.380
(chuckles)

03:37.718 --> 03:40.554
Now we know why he ran--
guns, cuffs, duct tape.

03:40.588 --> 03:44.425
What tipped you off?

03:44.458 --> 03:45.359
DON:
I don't know.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.461
- Something about him.
- Okay, this guy--

03:47.495 --> 03:49.663
he cruises a meth lab, right?
He's got a kidnapper's

03:49.697 --> 03:51.565
shopping list
in the back of his van.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.934
Yeah, so, whatever he was up to,
it's definitely not alone.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.304
You get the feeling
we're looking at the tip

03:56.337 --> 03:57.305
of a whole other iceberg?

04:09.883 --> 04:12.653
COLBY: Duct tape, plastic
handcuffs.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.588
Those are cable ties,

04:14.622 --> 04:15.956
purchased legally
at a hardware store.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.491
I have the receipt.

04:17.525 --> 04:18.926
Soundproofing insulation?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.961
Which is why
I bought the duct tape.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.630
Three handguns?

04:22.663 --> 04:24.432
Legitimately possessed,
in accordance

04:24.465 --> 04:26.400
with all federal
and local requirements.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.968
Cruising around
a meth lab.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.738
I didn't know anything
about a lab. I was lost.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.841
I asked the cops
for directions to the freeway.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.709
Then why'd you run?

04:35.743 --> 04:38.379
Illinois v. Wardlow

04:38.412 --> 04:40.981
allows the police to stop anyone
for the simple act of running.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.651
It does not constitute grounds
for arrest.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.754
Yeah, well,
we're not the police.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.855
We're the Feds.

04:47.888 --> 04:48.889
There's different rules,

04:48.922 --> 04:50.758
and a whole different set
of problems for you.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.726
You know, and having
a smart answer

04:52.760 --> 04:55.329
to every question-- it's not
going to change the facts.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.698
You were cruising that meth lab.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.699
Played it cool

04:58.732 --> 05:01.769
when SWAT stopped you,
but when my partner here

05:01.802 --> 05:03.537
took a second look,
and you knew

05:03.571 --> 05:05.105
we were going to
check inside your van--

05:05.138 --> 05:06.907
I just think
you lost your spine.

05:06.940 --> 05:07.741
Illinois v. Wardlow...

05:07.775 --> 05:09.543
I guess you didn't want us to
find

05:09.577 --> 05:12.446
your legally-purchased
duct tape

05:12.480 --> 05:14.448
and your insulation

05:14.482 --> 05:16.617
and your handcuffs
and your guns.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.719
You can't prove anything.

05:18.752 --> 05:19.787
DAVID:
Oh, I think we will.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.954
And while that's happening,

05:20.988 --> 05:22.623
you're just going to sit here

05:22.656 --> 05:24.825
and think about every
mistake you made,

05:24.858 --> 05:27.561
and how easy it's going to be
for us to find them.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.730
COLBY: Because when we find
those mistakes,

05:29.763 --> 05:31.832
any chance you have

05:31.865 --> 05:33.701
of coming clean
and making a deal goes away,

05:33.734 --> 05:34.935
and so do you.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.739
MEGAN: Isaac Meechum came from
Helena, Montana,

05:38.772 --> 05:40.508
five months ago,

05:40.541 --> 05:42.676
or at least, that's when
he changed over his license.

05:42.710 --> 05:43.477
No rap sheet?

05:43.511 --> 05:44.612
Not even
a speeding ticket, but if

05:44.645 --> 05:46.814
you're going to send out a guy
to go buy ammunition,

05:46.847 --> 05:48.616
guns and duct tape...

05:48.649 --> 05:50.818
We found registered purchases
for 15 rifles and pistols.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.952
That's including

05:51.985 --> 05:53.787
the three we already recovered.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.088
Which makes sense.
If you're going

05:55.122 --> 05:56.990
to hit a meth lab,
you're going to need

05:57.024 --> 05:58.926
some serious firepower
and some partners.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.561
All right,
so where are the rest of them?

06:00.594 --> 06:01.695
That's a good question.

06:01.729 --> 06:04.632
LAPD tossed this guy's
apartment, but not only weren't

06:04.665 --> 06:05.899
there any guns, super says

06:05.933 --> 06:07.635
he hadn't seen the guy
in a couple of weeks.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.069
So, what, we got, a stash house?

06:09.102 --> 06:10.871
Well, Intelligence Unit
did have something.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.473
They have a connection

06:12.506 --> 06:15.609
to a Montana group
called The New America Front.

06:15.643 --> 06:18.045
DAVID: Those guys are pro-gun,
anti-government, anti-tax, and

06:18.078 --> 06:19.547
you can pretty much guess

06:19.580 --> 06:21.782
why Meechum didn't make
eye contact with me once.

06:21.815 --> 06:22.683
MEGAN:
Their leaders were

06:22.716 --> 06:24.452
arrested last year
for planning to bomb

06:24.485 --> 06:26.019
an IRS collection center,

06:26.053 --> 06:27.655
and the rest
of them scattered, so,

06:27.688 --> 06:29.089
we might be looking at, like,
a splinter group,

06:29.122 --> 06:30.458
trying to fund a new attack.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.660
Well, good. Then we'll hold him

06:32.693 --> 06:34.595
as a domestic
terror suspect.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.597
This is just a theory.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.198
So what? We don't want him
getting to a phone

06:38.231 --> 06:39.800
before we find out
if there's a stash house

06:39.833 --> 06:41.602
or where the rest
of the people are, right?

06:41.635 --> 06:45.038
That's arbitrary suppression
of due process.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.840
If that's what it takes, fine.

06:48.776 --> 06:52.079
You know, we also, uh, found

06:52.112 --> 06:54.214
one of those
portable GPS

06:54.247 --> 06:55.916
navigation devices
in Meechum's van.

06:55.949 --> 06:59.152
Which also makes sense
if you're new to L.A.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.788
Did you check the addresses
on it?

07:00.821 --> 07:02.956
It's mostly restaurants,
bars, some hardware stores,

07:02.990 --> 07:04.157
but, look, I was thinking.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.960
If his partners don't know
we nabbed this guy yet, right--

07:06.994 --> 07:08.762
they're going to start
wondering where he is.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.531
So, maybe we drop the van

07:10.564 --> 07:12.866
at the last bar
Meechum went to.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.201
- Maybe we get lucky.
- MEGAN: They find the van.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.504
We find the partners?

07:17.871 --> 07:20.908
COLBY: It's a pretty basic GPS
with no data

07:20.941 --> 07:22.810
on times or routes.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.845
Just the ten most recent
destinations he typed in.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.146
COLBY: Right, which gives us 11
points,

07:26.179 --> 07:27.848
including the meth lab.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.983
So, I see a map
with a bunch of dots on it.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.619
I figure you can
tell me something.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.220
Maybe even find the stash house.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.822
Oh, you know,
there's not enough data here

07:34.855 --> 07:36.857
for any kind
of inference.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.893
Uh, maybe some application
of Floyd-Warshall?

07:39.927 --> 07:42.062
Hmm. Wouldn't the process

07:42.095 --> 07:43.964
of comparing
all potential routes

07:43.997 --> 07:45.833
between each set
of points require

07:45.866 --> 07:47.801
a lot of brute force?

07:51.004 --> 07:52.005
COLBY:
That's just not

07:52.039 --> 07:53.206
an expression I would normally

07:53.240 --> 07:54.908
associate with, uh...

07:54.942 --> 07:56.744
Well, anyway.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.913
Yeah. Understood.

07:59.947 --> 08:00.914
Well,

08:00.948 --> 08:02.516
we know the order

08:02.550 --> 08:04.785
that the locations
were arrived at, so

08:04.818 --> 08:08.288
what about doing
a time series analysis

08:08.321 --> 08:10.190
of overlapping
Dirichlet tessellations?

08:10.223 --> 08:11.959
Wow.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.994
Mm-hmm. See, each location

08:14.027 --> 08:16.564
is a place that Meechum
couldn't find without his GPS,

08:16.597 --> 08:17.798
so we can assume
that he's unfamiliar

08:17.831 --> 08:19.299
with the other streets
in the area, as well.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.301
From there, we build out.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.571
Like driving a stake
into a frozen river.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.005
We can watch the cracks grow.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.641
The more stakes we drive, the
more cracks we can analyze.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.743
And the pattern
will present itself.

08:29.777 --> 08:30.978
COLBY: Yeah, but what kind of
pattern?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.112
That's the best part.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.982
- We won't know until we do it.
- Heady stuff, Charles.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.117
I smell a paper here,
at the very least.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.052
Yeah. We'll need Amita,

08:39.086 --> 08:40.654
and dry erase boards.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.656
Lots of dry
erase boards.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.330
ALAN:
Hey, Amita.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.965
Hey, Alan.

08:51.999 --> 08:52.933
Um, you know, I think

08:52.966 --> 08:55.769
Charlie's still
in his classroom, but here.

08:55.803 --> 08:56.770
Whoa.

08:56.804 --> 08:59.072
What are we looking for?

08:59.106 --> 09:00.908
Uh, nothing. We are tidying up,

09:00.941 --> 09:03.577
because my parents are finally
coming on Tuesday

09:03.611 --> 09:05.078
after canceling
on me twice.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.948
Oh, and what does that got
to do with Charlie's office?

09:07.981 --> 09:08.949
Um...
(spluttering)

09:08.982 --> 09:10.117
Absolutely nothing.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.819
Just lots
of nervous energy.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.020
Yeah, well, a
little excitement

09:13.053 --> 09:14.221
under the circumstances

09:14.254 --> 09:15.989
is quite understandable.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.992
Yeah, it's been a year
since they went back to India,

09:19.026 --> 09:20.127
and, um,

09:20.160 --> 09:22.930
every time they come to town,
we have this tradition.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.998
We take a hike
through Elysian Park,

09:25.032 --> 09:28.969
and then, we go
to Roscoe's for waffles.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.938
- Waffles?
- Yes.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.339
Waffles.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.007
You know,
when I was little,

09:34.041 --> 09:37.010
we each made a list
of our five favorite foods,

09:37.044 --> 09:39.680
and waffles was the only thing

09:39.713 --> 09:40.981
that made it
on each of our lists.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.616
Oh.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.018
And honestly, I think
my dad just put it on there

09:45.052 --> 09:47.120
because he knew
how much I loved them.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.022
(cell phone chiming)

09:49.056 --> 09:50.257
Oh.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.692
Sorry. That's my mom.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.694
Probably texting me
the flight info.

09:56.029 --> 09:56.930
(phone chimes)

09:58.766 --> 10:00.233
What? Bad news?

10:00.267 --> 10:01.669
Well,

10:01.702 --> 10:04.838
they-they, um...
they have to postpone again.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.807
Oh.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.042
Uh, an emergency meeting with
the Ministry of Finance.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.978
Yeah, well,
I'm sure

10:11.011 --> 10:12.379
they're just
as disappointed as you are.

10:12.412 --> 10:16.083
Yeah, I'm sure they are.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.653
Here, sorry. Let
me take these.

10:19.687 --> 10:20.888
Oh, thanks.
I'm sorry.

10:20.921 --> 10:21.955
Yeah...

10:23.190 --> 10:25.158
Uh...

10:25.192 --> 10:27.094
(distant siren wailing)

10:34.034 --> 10:36.003
COLBY:
Did I tell you about the dog?

10:36.036 --> 10:36.870
DAVID:
That's the one

10:36.904 --> 10:38.939
that followed you
home from jogging.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.808
Then the owner saw you,
he called the cops,

10:40.841 --> 10:42.075
and he accused
you of dognapping.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.111
- Yeah.
- About two hours ago.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.915
Right.
(sighing)

10:51.151 --> 10:53.320
Hey, guess who
called me, man,

10:53.353 --> 10:56.389
after you said she was
never going to do it.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.091
Yeah, you told me.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.073
Well, I guess that's it.

11:13.106 --> 11:17.377
We've, uh, officially run out
of stuff to talk about.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.181
DAVID:
Okay.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.184
All right, 20 bucks says
we get a bite before midnight.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.019
All right,
how do you define bite?

11:26.053 --> 11:28.155
Looking in the window,
trying the door?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.791
Well, not a window,
definitely a door.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.060
Door's a bite.

11:40.768 --> 11:43.170
Double or nothing
on the Le Mans.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.239
What do you mean

11:46.273 --> 11:47.440
double or
nothing, man?

11:47.474 --> 11:49.576
I was just betting
on the bite.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.216
All right,
they're going inside

11:56.249 --> 11:58.986
to see if Meechum's passed out
on the bar.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.759
Checking the bathroom.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.964
Now he's wondering
what the hell happened.

12:10.998 --> 12:11.965
Yeah, and ten more minutes,

12:11.999 --> 12:14.534
I would have
made 20 bucks.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.502
(car door shuts)

12:26.313 --> 12:29.049
(grunts, smashes window)
Early.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.084
Right in front of us?

12:36.323 --> 12:38.959
They find the hardware
but no guns.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.060
What are they thinking?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.294
Figuring Meechum got halfway

12:41.328 --> 12:43.831
through his shopping list,
fell into

12:43.864 --> 12:47.500
the gin mill, got dragged home
by some girl.

12:47.534 --> 12:48.501
I've been
to plenty

12:48.535 --> 12:50.503
of gin mills in my day, man.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.539
Who are these women
that just drag you home?

12:52.572 --> 12:53.606
Where do I find them?

12:53.640 --> 12:57.144
You, my friend, are a prisoner
of high standards

12:57.177 --> 12:59.847
and...

12:59.880 --> 13:02.282
low social skills.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.853
(engine revving)

13:54.001 --> 13:55.969
DAVID:
Looks like we found

13:56.003 --> 13:57.537
the stash house.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.306
And now we just have
to figure out

13:59.339 --> 14:01.474
what the hell's
going on inside.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.077
Yeah.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.561
Thank you,
soft real estate market.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.491
We like?

14:54.327 --> 14:56.964
We like.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.986
MAN (over radio):
Regular cigarettes.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.520
Hey, heads up.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.522
MAN 2: Maybe I'm going to stop
smoking before, uh...

15:22.555 --> 15:24.457
- What is it you said...
- Before I'm 39?

15:24.491 --> 15:25.592
Maybe I'd be done
before that.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.694
- Yeah.
- That the Beemer?

15:27.727 --> 15:29.362
- Is that who that is?
- Think so.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.630
Looks good.
(camera snapping)

15:30.663 --> 15:33.166
- Classy car.
- I'd take that.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.202
I guess we should be
talking about some...

15:35.235 --> 15:38.205
(conversation trails off)
(camera snapping)

15:38.238 --> 15:39.072
(blipping)

15:39.106 --> 15:40.673
AMITA:
Yeah, I know that they're busy

15:40.707 --> 15:42.976
and that their work
is very important, but...

15:43.010 --> 15:45.045
Consulting on the
national finances

15:45.078 --> 15:47.080
of the second-largest population
on the planet...

15:48.248 --> 15:50.017
...but if you're angry,
so am I,

15:50.050 --> 15:51.718
within whatever
acceptable boundaries

15:51.751 --> 15:54.721
won't come back
to haunt me later.

15:54.754 --> 15:57.324
No. It's not that I'm mad,
it's just--

15:57.357 --> 15:59.626
I mean, do you know
what it feels like

15:59.659 --> 16:02.562
to not see your family
for a really long time?

16:02.595 --> 16:05.232
That hasn't been a problem
for me for quite a while.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.334
(chuckles)

16:08.435 --> 16:10.070
Well,
I don't know,

16:10.103 --> 16:13.573
I mean, lately my parents
just feel like a pair of voices,

16:13.606 --> 16:15.542
and I feel disconnected,

16:15.575 --> 16:18.611
like a piece of who I am
is starting to blur.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.182
Well, you are connected, and...

16:22.215 --> 16:24.584
they will come
eventually.

16:24.617 --> 16:25.652
(knocking at door)

16:25.685 --> 16:26.653
ALAN:
Uh...

16:26.686 --> 16:27.654
Hey, guys, bad time?

16:27.687 --> 16:28.655
ALAN:
You kidding?

16:28.688 --> 16:30.590
Last week I walked in on them
and they were...

16:30.623 --> 16:33.326
Thanks, Dad. Uh,
what brings you here so late?

16:33.360 --> 16:34.594
Well, I wasn't gonna
wake you up,

16:34.627 --> 16:37.030
but I was actually driving by
and I saw the lights were on,

16:37.064 --> 16:37.864
so...

16:37.897 --> 16:38.931
Maybe I should make a cup of
coffee

16:38.965 --> 16:40.800
- for somebody here?
- Not for me; I need to grab

16:40.833 --> 16:42.001
a few hours
shut-eye.

16:42.035 --> 16:45.138
Well, we already factored
the house into our computations.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.206
It's really moving
the work along.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.340
Moving it

16:47.374 --> 16:48.341
to what, exactly?

16:48.375 --> 16:49.776
Uncharted territory.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.779
The Dirichlet tessellations
have something to tell us.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.647
I know it
every time I look at this map,

16:54.681 --> 16:55.748
even if I don't know what.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.684
That's actually what I
wanted to talk to you about.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.520
What if they're using
three different vehicles?

17:00.553 --> 17:03.056
I mean, can we
factor in situations

17:03.090 --> 17:06.393
where they would use one
but not the other two?

17:06.426 --> 17:09.429
We've got Agent Granger thinking
like a mathematician.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.298
He's definitely starting
to sound like one.

17:14.701 --> 17:18.805
Facial recognition software
gives subject one a 95% match

17:18.838 --> 17:20.607
and subject two a 93% match.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.775
I have no doubt
it's the same guy.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.311
Joshua Quigley
has an arrest

17:24.344 --> 17:26.313
for assault, possession
of unregistered weapons,

17:26.346 --> 17:27.314
tax evasion.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.582
Bernard Laiken--
assault,

17:29.616 --> 17:30.750
possession of
unregistered weapons.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.752
Both in
The New America Front.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.121
You know, the
subject house

17:34.154 --> 17:35.422
was rented by Meechum.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.090
Meechum's name
is on the registration

17:37.124 --> 17:39.726
- for all three vehicles.
- They have to know the meth lab

17:39.759 --> 17:41.228
is down, right,
they can't find Meechum,

17:41.261 --> 17:42.662
so what are they going to do?

17:42.695 --> 17:46.299
I did a little deeper background
on The New America Front.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.601
They're a classic white
supremacist group. I think if

17:48.635 --> 17:49.702
they were gonna target
drug dealers,

17:49.736 --> 17:52.472
they would have gone
after a black or Hispanic gang.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.706
I mean,
he was there for a reason.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.642
CHARLIE:
Well, maybe,

17:55.675 --> 17:57.544
or maybe it's a black swan.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.147
For a long time,
Europeans believed

18:00.180 --> 18:03.250
that all swans were white.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.851
And that notion only held true
as long

18:04.884 --> 18:07.887
as their discovered world
contained only white swans,

18:07.920 --> 18:09.556
but then Australia
was discovered

18:09.589 --> 18:10.790
and the black swan
was discovered,

18:10.823 --> 18:11.791
so their perceptions

18:11.824 --> 18:14.727
of the world and what swans were
had to change.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.397
Nassim Nicholas Taleb
recently wrote a book

18:17.430 --> 18:19.899
in which he uses
the term "black swan" to define

18:19.932 --> 18:22.602
any event that occurs outside
the realm of expectations.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.205
Like a drug raid that leads
to a completely unrelated case?

18:25.238 --> 18:26.273
Yeah,

18:26.306 --> 18:28.875
I mean, we attempt
to find causality in all events

18:28.908 --> 18:31.144
based on past experience, right,
but Taleb argues

18:31.178 --> 18:32.645
that the biggest events
can't be predicted

18:32.679 --> 18:33.880
because they just
never happened before.

18:33.913 --> 18:34.881
9/11--

18:34.914 --> 18:35.948
case in point.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.551
Well, we need to be focusing
on the terror angle.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.387
Well, we just caught
a really lucky break

18:40.420 --> 18:43.890
'cause the case just started
to fit those charges.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.827
Start working on it.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.665
(clears throat)

18:59.839 --> 19:01.774
Oh, my, what was that about?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.876
What? I had to push a rule
or two, and, you know,

19:03.910 --> 19:05.612
I mean, she disagrees.
What else is new?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.847
You had to?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.584
Yeah.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.787
Hard not to notice a...

19:14.821 --> 19:17.690
change in your methods.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.895
Look, I'm tired
of picking up the pieces.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.832
Okay? It seems like all we do
is get there too late,

19:25.865 --> 19:29.302
and I got a chance to stop
something before it starts.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.805
You still seeing your therapist?

19:32.839 --> 19:35.442
(chuckles)

19:35.475 --> 19:36.576
Taleb also

19:36.609 --> 19:40.847
says that we should rank
our beliefs not by plausibility

19:40.880 --> 19:44.884
but by the harm
they may cause.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.302
Oh, hey.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.872
I've come to recognize
that expression.

20:05.905 --> 20:09.208
It generally precedes a
canceled breakfast date.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.580
Another day,

20:13.613 --> 20:16.883
another moral quandary.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.986
If I may make an
observation...

20:20.019 --> 20:21.020
Always.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.389
You are

20:22.422 --> 20:24.857
a brilliant and
credentialed woman;

20:24.891 --> 20:27.460
one for whom the
world offers

20:27.494 --> 20:29.729
a multitude of
possibilities...

20:31.864 --> 20:34.000
Are you saying
I should quit my job?

20:34.033 --> 20:35.034
No.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.270
I'm merely suggesting that,

20:37.304 --> 20:39.539
if your reasons for
doing this work

20:39.572 --> 20:42.008
have been
challenged or,

20:42.041 --> 20:44.544
uh, invalidated,

20:44.577 --> 20:48.548
then yeah, you need to find
some new reasons...

20:48.581 --> 20:50.483
or some new work.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.024
CHARLIE:
See anything?

20:58.057 --> 21:00.460
AMITA: Graph entropies
and universality classes.

21:00.493 --> 21:01.928
Nothing new there.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.463
Maybe I'm wrong.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.931
Do you think
you're wrong?

21:04.964 --> 21:06.633
No.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.801
Neither do I.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.404
Guess we'll just have to let
this program run its course.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.572
Yeah.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.873
In moments like this,

21:13.906 --> 21:15.575
the processes of criminal
investigation

21:15.608 --> 21:17.844
and science seem to work
at cross purposes, don't they?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.846
We need to be patient...

21:19.879 --> 21:21.448
- But not.
- Right.

21:22.582 --> 21:25.017
So after this is over,

21:25.051 --> 21:27.387
and before the next thing,

21:27.420 --> 21:29.922
I thought maybe you and I could
take a trip to Delhi.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.494
That's very sweet.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.028
I thought so.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.998
But...

21:39.031 --> 21:41.568
I don't have the time
or ability,

21:41.601 --> 21:43.570
and neither do you.

21:43.603 --> 21:46.038
I just don't like seeing
you unhappy like this.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.007
So, I wanted to do something.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.043
You just did.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.090
QUIGLEY (over radio): What do
you think happened to him?

22:04.123 --> 22:06.593
A girl?

22:06.626 --> 22:08.928
No. Not in a whorehouse
with a fistful of 20s.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.930
No, he got the jeebies--

22:10.963 --> 22:12.131
halfway to Billings by now.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.100
QUIGLEY:
Meechum was a wannabe--

22:14.133 --> 22:16.102
told you he'd bolt
from day one.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.970
What if he said something
about the magic show?

22:18.004 --> 22:21.007
LAIKEN: What if he does? Won't
stop anything.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.578
"Magic show."

22:25.612 --> 22:27.046
Shotgun mikes aren't
picking up anything

22:27.079 --> 22:28.515
on the inside-- we do know

22:28.548 --> 22:30.016
they don't
suspect we have Meechum.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.485
Maybe time to hit the house;
we've got enough for a warrant.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.521
We'll have a few gun charges,
if we're lucky.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.789
I mean, we don't know
who else is involved or where.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.958
DAVID: Or what the hell they're
planning.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.093
How about trying to get
a wire in there?

22:41.127 --> 22:43.463
No, these guys never step
more than three feet

22:43.496 --> 22:45.498
outside the front
door for a smoke.

22:45.532 --> 22:48.034
One of 'em will go pick up
groceries or something

22:48.067 --> 22:49.001
but never both.
I mean,

22:49.035 --> 22:51.070
it'll take a ninja.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.941
Or a black swan.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.176
- Oh!
- What the hell?

22:57.209 --> 22:58.177
No, no,

22:58.210 --> 23:00.480
no, no! Come on! Oh, my God.

23:00.513 --> 23:03.182
This is why you're not supposed
to text and drive.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.051
MAN:
What are you thinking, woman?

23:05.084 --> 23:07.053
MEGAN:
I wasn't thinking anything...

23:07.086 --> 23:08.621
This is totally my fault.

23:08.655 --> 23:09.956
Yes, it is your fault.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.090
I have insurance.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.560
(muted argument continues)

23:13.593 --> 23:18.465
MEGAN: I'm so sorry. This is
totally my fault.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.467
Yeah.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.101
Colby, go down
the elevator shaft.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.035
Colby, jump in the bay.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.737
Hey, Colby, climb
the Sixth Street Bridge.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.073
I went out on the bridge
with you, okay?

23:27.106 --> 23:28.875
My boyfriend's totally
going to kill me.

23:28.908 --> 23:29.909
Look, forget
about it.

23:29.942 --> 23:30.843
Forget it, okay? Look.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.812
It did more damage to your car
than mine.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.647
MEGAN: Yeah, but this is all my
fault.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.583
Let's just exchange...

23:46.158 --> 23:47.727
- Forget about it, okay?
- No, no, no.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.596
This is my fault,
and look, your car's

23:49.629 --> 23:51.430
- like a classic.
- No, no, it's good. It's fine.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.187
(door opens)

24:46.753 --> 24:48.054
Psst, psst!

25:27.694 --> 25:29.662
Any luck?

25:29.696 --> 25:32.164
Facial recognition software,
my brain is not.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.166
But I've been through
Intel's entire dossier

25:34.200 --> 25:35.702
on The New America Front,

25:35.735 --> 25:37.704
pretty sure
he's not in there.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.706
Meechum give us
anything yet?

25:39.739 --> 25:42.809
No, and we've been
on him hard.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.844
We've been on this house
for 38 hours now.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.913
As far as we can tell,
he's never come out.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.181
What the hell's
he doing in there?

25:49.215 --> 25:51.283
There's just nothing
with the bug?

25:51.317 --> 25:54.053
Nothing audible anyway, and it
doesn't look like they're using

25:54.086 --> 25:56.723
the upstairs for anything other
than storage. In fact,

25:56.756 --> 25:58.791
I think that Number Three
came from the garage.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.696
I mean...

26:03.730 --> 26:06.032
duct tape and
insulation...

26:06.065 --> 26:08.034
I mean, you know,

26:08.067 --> 26:09.001
could be these guys are building

26:09.035 --> 26:12.705
their own soundproof
prison cell in there.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.707
Look, how long can
we stay with this

26:14.741 --> 26:17.744
before we cut our losses
and drag them in?

26:17.777 --> 26:19.679
Longer.

26:26.218 --> 26:29.989
So, this is a...
stakeout, hmm?

26:30.022 --> 26:32.992
Yeah, sometimes
they're boring.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.831
What's that thing going to do
for you?

26:38.865 --> 26:40.867
I don't know yet.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.635
Um...

26:42.669 --> 26:44.704
I just figured a little
fieldwork might

26:44.737 --> 26:47.740
bring some welcome madness
to my method, I guess.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.709
I don't even know
what I'm looking at here.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.277
How he got to
that hardware store

26:51.310 --> 26:52.945
or the gas
station.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.213
There's...

26:54.246 --> 26:58.284
no underlying meaning
I can see yet.

26:58.317 --> 26:59.786
Mm.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.855
What are you,
what are you reading?

27:02.889 --> 27:05.958
Article on Billy Preston's
work on Let it Be.

27:05.992 --> 27:08.761
Mm, the Beatles.

27:08.795 --> 27:09.862
Yeah. You're a fan?

27:09.896 --> 27:11.097
Of course.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.832
Yeah, the Beatles.
Who isn't a fan?

27:12.865 --> 27:13.565
Yeah.

27:13.599 --> 27:15.134
I mean I'm not
an obsessed fan,

27:15.167 --> 27:18.070
you know. Some people read
every article.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.945
Yeah. You know,

27:25.978 --> 27:27.914
your screen, it,
um, reminds me

27:27.947 --> 27:29.982
of this old video game
I used to play.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.719
Missile Command, right?

27:32.752 --> 27:33.986
Yeah, Missile Command. Right?

27:34.020 --> 27:35.688
You're, you're a fan
of the classics?

27:35.722 --> 27:37.924
Well, they had all the old
machines at, um,

27:37.957 --> 27:39.058
at the Calsci Rathskellar.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.993
They had Asteroids,
Space Invaders...

27:41.027 --> 27:42.261
Same thing at Cornell.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.196
Man, I lost my whole sophomore
year to Frogger.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.798
I never had any quarters

27:45.832 --> 27:48.067
for the laundry, but I could do
the first three levels

27:48.100 --> 27:49.668
with my eyes closed, man.
Back and forth.

27:51.337 --> 27:54.106
That's good stuff. Good stuff.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.942
Well, that's it...

27:55.975 --> 27:57.409
Frogger, is it?

27:57.443 --> 27:59.812
You knew all those first few
levels by heart,

27:59.846 --> 28:01.247
because you played them so much.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.882
They had a higher level
of familiarity.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.251
So maybe this map
isn't just telling us

28:05.284 --> 28:08.254
about the streets and routes
that Meechum didn't know--

28:08.287 --> 28:09.822
maybe it's telling us

28:09.856 --> 28:12.825
the streets and routes
that he knew well.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.861
So, all I have to do...

28:14.894 --> 28:17.296
is, um...

28:19.966 --> 28:21.167
- I got us lunch.
- Yeah, I'm sorry,

28:21.200 --> 28:22.902
I have to get Amita to
rewrite this program.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.370
And don't forget
to use the back, okay?

28:24.403 --> 28:25.772
Right. Sure.

28:27.907 --> 28:30.176
(knocking on door)
Hi.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.878
Is Charlie here yet?
He said

28:31.911 --> 28:33.279
- he needed some assistance.
- No,

28:33.312 --> 28:35.915
- he's not here yet.
- Oh.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.449
Searching for patterns
of your own, I see.

28:37.483 --> 28:38.517
Ahh...

28:38.550 --> 28:40.820
Still trying to find a
connection between Meechum

28:40.853 --> 28:41.754
and the meth lab.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.255
- You certain there is one?
- Otherwise

28:43.289 --> 28:45.825
it's just a really big
coincidence. Oh,

28:45.858 --> 28:47.827
an easily explained one.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.361
I mean, you're both highly
experienced,

28:49.395 --> 28:51.798
gifted investigators,
you saw something amiss.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.766
Now, the fact that
Meechum shows up

28:53.800 --> 28:56.235
as you're in the process
of making an arrest,

28:56.268 --> 28:58.905
well, that may be
no more significant

28:58.938 --> 29:02.208
than if you bumped into him
at a grocery store.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.976
What, like a black swan,
perhaps?

29:04.010 --> 29:05.978
Uh... you know,

29:06.012 --> 29:08.981
a black swan is not really
a coincidence.

29:09.015 --> 29:11.050
I mean, it's more properly
an unexpected,

29:11.083 --> 29:14.987
unpredictable event
with large consequences.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.989
Hmm.

29:17.023 --> 29:21.060
You ever stop to consider
the possibility

29:21.093 --> 29:23.129
that Meechum's arrest
is not even

29:23.162 --> 29:25.031
your black swan,

29:25.064 --> 29:28.334
that maybe you
are his?

29:28.367 --> 29:31.037
- Our raid is the coincidence?
- Yeah, but

29:31.070 --> 29:32.204
not really a coincidence.

29:32.238 --> 29:35.975
So when they go out to smoke...

29:36.008 --> 29:37.209
If Number Three
is the alpha,

29:37.243 --> 29:38.577
maybe he is asserting
his dominance--

29:38.610 --> 29:39.846
he, he doesn't
want them

29:39.879 --> 29:41.247
stinking up the house.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.149
Or...

29:43.182 --> 29:45.084
he doesn't want them
blowing it up.

29:45.117 --> 29:48.154
Methamphetamine labs are filled
with explosive chemicals.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.156
Exactly. What if Meechum
wasn't there to rob them,

29:50.189 --> 29:52.859
he was there to do business,
right? I mean, look.

29:52.892 --> 29:55.862
We got acetone.
We got sulfur. We got peroxide.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.396
A highly combustive trio.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.331
Which is really hard
to buy in bulk

29:59.365 --> 30:01.033
without drawing attention

30:01.067 --> 30:03.069
to yourself.
We have Meechum in custody.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.304
And since we've had him
in custody, we've watched

30:05.337 --> 30:07.006
these guys make random trips

30:07.039 --> 30:08.607
to the pharmacy,
to the grocery store...

30:08.640 --> 30:10.009
DON:
Duct tape,

30:10.042 --> 30:11.610
- insulation...
- The New America Front...

30:11.643 --> 30:15.882
They... they tried to blow up
an IRS building

30:15.915 --> 30:16.916
in Montana;
they're building a bomb.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.985
They're making
a really big bomb.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.552
Or they're making
a lot of little ones.

30:20.586 --> 30:21.787
Okay, get SWAT

30:21.820 --> 30:24.556
and the bomb squad rolling,
and LAPD evacuating the area.

30:25.892 --> 30:28.027
This is highly exhilarating.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.129
QUIGLEY (over radio):
What do we need?

30:30.162 --> 30:32.564
LAIKEN:
Grab the Mini-14 and the nines.

30:32.598 --> 30:34.901
Leave the shotguns,
get them on the next trip.

30:34.934 --> 30:36.936
- QUIGLEY: What about the cuffs?
- LAIKEN: Yeah, the cuffs.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.470
Gotcha.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.973
Don thinks they're cooking
a bomb in there; Tac's rolling.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.274
They're not waiting.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.475
Quigley and Laiken,

30:43.509 --> 30:44.877
they're on the move.

30:50.316 --> 30:51.918
FBI! You!

30:51.951 --> 30:53.152
Hands up!

30:53.185 --> 30:54.320
Put down the gun!

30:54.353 --> 30:55.587
(rapid gunfire)

31:06.232 --> 31:08.567
Stakeout Team Charlie,
we got shots fired,

31:08.600 --> 31:10.169
and a fleeing vehicle.

31:10.202 --> 31:14.473
It's a gray pickup truck,
California plates 5QNI223.

31:14.506 --> 31:15.574
Gun!

31:19.511 --> 31:20.646
What do you think?

31:20.679 --> 31:22.214
Wait or go?

31:22.248 --> 31:24.083
He could have
more bombs in there.

31:24.116 --> 31:28.354
That's kind of why I asked.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.021
Go?

31:29.055 --> 31:31.991
Yeah, I knew you'd say "go."

31:36.562 --> 31:37.529
Hey!

31:37.563 --> 31:38.931
Come on out!

31:38.965 --> 31:40.967
It's over, okay?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.601
You've got nowhere to go!

31:46.405 --> 31:47.406
(racks sliding)

31:47.439 --> 31:48.674
Sir!

31:48.707 --> 31:51.210
You're in a bomb lab!

31:51.243 --> 31:53.079
You know better than to...
(yelling)

31:59.685 --> 32:01.487
Apparently not.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.631
So they found the truck. It was
ditched, like,

32:12.664 --> 32:13.865
three blocks away.

32:13.899 --> 32:14.733
But they also found glass at
the scene, so they're thinking

32:14.766 --> 32:17.536
that Quigley has
stolen another vehicle.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.038
And Colby called.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.973
They found cut lengths
of pipe in the basement.

32:21.007 --> 32:22.474
All right,
so then pipe bombs, right?

32:22.508 --> 32:23.675
Well, you think
this guy's running

32:23.709 --> 32:25.677
or is he going to finish
what he started?

32:25.711 --> 32:27.980
A fanatic
who spent five months

32:28.014 --> 32:29.481
preparing
for a spectacular event.

32:29.515 --> 32:30.649
And the federal government,

32:30.682 --> 32:32.651
who he already
has something against,

32:32.684 --> 32:35.354
has, like, ruined his plan
and killed all his friends.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.755
You gotta ask?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.324
Got it.

32:40.226 --> 32:41.493
I want to know
everything.

32:41.527 --> 32:42.328
I want to know it now!

32:42.361 --> 32:44.997
I want a phone call
and a lawyer.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.732
Laiken is dead.

32:46.765 --> 32:48.534
They're taking
your bomb maker

32:48.567 --> 32:50.436
out in pieces as we speak.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.104
- Now it's over.
- If it were over

32:52.138 --> 32:54.140
you wouldn't have dragged me
out of Guantanamo

32:54.173 --> 32:55.741
- over Figueroa, would you?
- Do you even have

32:55.774 --> 32:57.543
a clue of the world
of hurt you're in?

32:57.576 --> 32:59.611
Conspiracy
to commit an act

32:59.645 --> 33:02.248
of domestic terrorism,
maybe, maybe

33:02.281 --> 33:03.549
you see the light
of day again.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.517
That bomb goes off,
you're a show trial.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.019
You're dead in 18 months.

33:07.053 --> 33:08.687
I'm not afraid to be
remembered for the cause.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.190
What cause? What?
Tax evasion?

33:11.223 --> 33:12.524
The Posse Comitatus Act

33:12.558 --> 33:14.260
obligates us to mount
resistance against

33:14.293 --> 33:17.096
an unlawful, immoral
and hypocritical government.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.031
You take away my freedom,

33:19.065 --> 33:21.533
deny me due process,
and now you try to deal?

33:26.205 --> 33:28.174
Even if I would,

33:28.207 --> 33:31.577
why would I trust you?

33:31.610 --> 33:35.114
Okay, you're trying to make
a political statement.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.448
My voice will be heard.

33:36.482 --> 33:37.783
At my trial,

33:37.816 --> 33:39.418
through my story,
it'll get out.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.453
Not while they're
counting bodies.

33:41.487 --> 33:42.754
Anything you have to say

33:42.788 --> 33:45.057
is going to get drowned
out by the voices

33:45.091 --> 33:46.825
of dead, innocent people

33:46.858 --> 33:48.560
and the families
they leave behind.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.529
No, no, we had it worked out--
no innocents.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.830
We go in at night,

33:51.863 --> 33:53.299
secure the guards
and the cleaners.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.067
Get them out before...

33:55.101 --> 33:57.536
Well, before...?

33:59.138 --> 34:01.173
That's not the plan
Quigley's following anymore.

34:02.808 --> 34:04.710
That's blood on your hands.

34:10.182 --> 34:11.750
Now how are we doing
with the cluster

34:11.783 --> 34:13.485
- radius changes?
- Almost entered.

34:13.519 --> 34:15.087
You know, given
our time constraints,

34:15.121 --> 34:17.656
we really should
disregard sub locations.

34:17.689 --> 34:20.226
Hey, tell us
you have more data.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.627
Security guards and cleaners.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.229
We're thinking it's
an office building.

34:23.262 --> 34:24.496
We're already biasing that way.

34:24.530 --> 34:25.531
DON:
Okay, so something tall

34:25.564 --> 34:26.665
where everyone can see it.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.500
You know, I think
downtown, maybe.

34:28.534 --> 34:29.835
Okay, that's a presumptive jump.

34:29.868 --> 34:32.538
- That's where we are, right?
- The leaders went

34:32.571 --> 34:35.541
to jail for planning to bomb
an IRS collections center.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.742
DON:
A federal building, huh?

34:36.775 --> 34:38.677
You know what?
Try something, uh...

34:39.845 --> 34:41.747
Like...

34:43.915 --> 34:45.851
- Like that.
- Okay.

34:47.519 --> 34:48.720
Okay, this is a grid

34:48.754 --> 34:51.257
of downtown streets
that Meechum knew

34:51.290 --> 34:53.359
well enough not to use his GPS,
but not explaining

34:53.392 --> 34:55.461
- his other known trips.
- Of course it could also mean

34:55.494 --> 34:57.629
that he had no reason
to go to this area,

34:57.663 --> 34:59.498
but if we have to play
the pure probabilities...

34:59.531 --> 35:00.732
Know what, could you put up

35:00.766 --> 35:02.668
- a satellite overlay?
- Yeah.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.740
Anything federal?

35:08.774 --> 35:10.742
Uh, there's banks,
commercial buildings,

35:10.776 --> 35:12.578
uh, hotels...

35:12.611 --> 35:14.180
restaurants, uh...

35:14.213 --> 35:16.448
You know what, this plot
was in retaliation for

35:16.482 --> 35:18.684
an IRS investigation into an SAR
on three of their members.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.686
LARRY:
"SAR"?

35:20.719 --> 35:21.853
Suspicious
Activity Report.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.589
Banks file them
with the Treasury

35:23.622 --> 35:26.792
when they suspect money
laundering or terror financing.

35:26.825 --> 35:29.295
This particular SAR was filed

35:29.328 --> 35:30.596
by Farmers' American,

35:30.629 --> 35:32.431
whose central bank is...

35:32.464 --> 35:34.266
- Right there, right?
- Yeah.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.867
Yeah, let's go.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.517
Green jacket, green jacket,
Move in. Move in!

36:27.653 --> 36:29.288
Quigley, don't move!

36:29.321 --> 36:31.390
Don't move!

36:31.423 --> 36:33.592
Everybody out!

36:33.625 --> 36:35.727
- You shoot me, we're a crater!
- All right.

36:35.761 --> 36:36.728
All right, all right.

36:36.762 --> 36:37.529
Just relax.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.931
- Don't tell me to relax.
- Okay.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.667
(people screaming)
Look.

36:41.700 --> 36:42.934
MEGAN:
All right,

36:42.968 --> 36:45.237
let's just take a minute.
Let's just talk.

36:45.271 --> 36:46.605
No talk! Everybody out!

36:46.638 --> 36:47.739
DON:
That's not going to happen.

36:47.773 --> 36:48.907
That's just not
going to happen.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.642
I've got seven
pipe bombs in here.

36:50.676 --> 36:51.943
My finger twitches,

36:51.977 --> 36:53.879
there's enough shrapnel
to shred everyone.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.651
Look, how about
I'll pull uniforms back?

36:59.685 --> 37:00.986
Let's start with that.

37:01.019 --> 37:01.920
All right, guys, get out.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.497
Okay?

37:11.530 --> 37:13.332
What are the rest of you
waiting for?

37:13.365 --> 37:15.267
Huh? You got a death wish?

37:16.368 --> 37:17.336
Not me. Do you?

37:17.369 --> 37:18.970
No.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.572
I just want to help,
man, that's it.

37:25.877 --> 37:27.746
So what are we doing here?

37:30.849 --> 37:32.318
Just go, okay?

37:32.351 --> 37:33.719
I need to think.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.522
I'll be straight with you.
We leave, there's a sniper

37:36.555 --> 37:38.457
up there who's
going to blow your brains out.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.893
I'm being totally
honest with you.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.562
Us standing here, that's about

37:43.595 --> 37:45.497
the only thing
that's keeping you alive.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.635
Why the hell
are you saying this?

37:49.668 --> 37:52.971
Because this is pointless.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.641
Look, you blow yourself up,
they're going to scrape you

37:55.674 --> 37:57.976
off the walls and gonna be back
in business in the morning.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.514
I'm telling you, I see so much
waste in what I do, man,

38:02.548 --> 38:03.882
I'm just trying to stop you
from doing something

38:03.915 --> 38:06.051
that I know is
not going to mean anything.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.376
Okay.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.711
All right, let's pull out.
Let's go.

38:39.551 --> 38:40.419
Wait!

38:41.887 --> 38:44.089
Okay, just wait.

38:44.122 --> 38:47.593
Good, get your hands
on your head.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.528
Don't move.

38:55.601 --> 38:59.070
That's a really interesting
negotiation technique.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.807
Hey, any bomb you can
walk away from, right?

39:05.010 --> 39:07.446
*I'll be home again
before you know it... *

39:07.479 --> 39:09.581
(laughter, lively chatter)

39:09.615 --> 39:11.683
DAVID: We were trying to back
out, right,

39:11.717 --> 39:12.951
you know what happened...

39:12.984 --> 39:14.085
There are some acts of heroism
I would rather remain blissfully

39:14.119 --> 39:15.521
unaware of.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.423
My son playing poker
with a bomb,

39:17.456 --> 39:18.657
now that's right up there.

39:18.690 --> 39:19.991
- Okay, enough, come on.
- You know, I have

39:20.025 --> 39:21.727
to second Alan's sentiment.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.629
I'm far more comfortable
with your bravery

39:23.662 --> 39:25.564
- in the abstract.
- Duly noted.

39:25.597 --> 39:26.865
COLBY:
Really?

39:26.898 --> 39:28.767
Because I figured that was
part of the whole, uh...

39:28.800 --> 39:31.002
The whole what, Granger?

39:31.036 --> 39:32.971
AMITA:
Charlie, what are you

39:33.004 --> 39:34.940
- doing in there?
- CHARLIE: Just a second.

39:34.973 --> 39:35.774
Sounds serious.

39:35.807 --> 39:37.142
He's not actually cooking, is
he?

39:37.175 --> 39:39.010
- Yes, he is.
- Is that bad?

39:39.044 --> 39:40.812
As long as I'm not in there,
for once.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.914
What is for dinner?
Charlie, what are you making?

39:42.948 --> 39:44.483
The invitation was pretty
non-specific, buddy.

39:44.516 --> 39:45.717
What's going on?

39:45.751 --> 39:47.419
(oohing and aahing)

39:47.453 --> 39:49.421
(laughter)

39:49.455 --> 39:50.789
It's an approximation at best,

39:50.822 --> 39:54.760
but I, uh, analyzed
Roscoe's secret recipe.

39:54.793 --> 39:55.627
Mmm...
Mmm...

39:55.661 --> 39:56.828
I think it's pretty good.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.864
DON:
Waffles for dinner?

39:58.897 --> 40:00.198
Waffles.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.100
CHARLIE:
Yeah.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.202
What's the deal
with the waffles, man?

40:04.235 --> 40:06.505
I think it's Charlie's way
of saying that

40:06.538 --> 40:08.807
your family is whoever you want
to eat waffles with.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.676
LARRY:
That's a worthy sentiment.

40:10.709 --> 40:11.810
And one that's even better with
syrup.

40:11.843 --> 40:12.978
DON: Gotta have some bacon,
though,

40:13.011 --> 40:13.845
you made some bacon,
right?

40:13.879 --> 40:15.747
Somebody tell me
something about chicken?

40:15.781 --> 40:17.449
- Where's the chicken?
- ALAN: It's in the waffles.

40:17.483 --> 40:20.051
(laughter)

40:20.085 --> 40:21.887
(laughing uncontrollably)

40:21.920 --> 40:26.925
* When we go back
in my home again *

40:26.958 --> 40:31.096
* I know that
we will be unstoppable *

40:31.129 --> 40:32.964
DON: That's the whole meal?
That's it, just waffles?

40:32.998 --> 40:37.002
* You know that we will
be unstoppable. *
