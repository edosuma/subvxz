00:06.920 --> 00:10.200
De Beauvoir's work
is steeped in patriarchal values.

00:11.320 --> 00:15.360
It asks how we can be better emancipated
living within a man's world

00:15.360 --> 00:18.000
rather than calling
for what women actually need,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.840
which is a complete withdrawal
from that mode of being.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.599
What are you suggesting?

00:23.279 --> 00:25.599
For women to go and live on some commune?

00:25.599 --> 00:27.400
No, darling. The men.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.879
- Have you got everything you need?
- Mum.

- Turtle, it's a party.
- Stop calling me Turtle. I hate it.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.160
But look at your cute little turtley nose.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.239
Just give it to me.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.640
Now look what you've done.

01:04.039 --> 01:07.280
You're going to get me in trouble.
I'm supposed to be watching you.

Morning, Turtle.
Has Otis not come back yet?

02:28.920 --> 02:31.640
No. He's been at Maeve's all weekend.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.080
Oh.

02:33.799 --> 02:37.360
He's got a mock exam today.
I feel like he's shutting me out.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.799
Maybe he's just embarrassed
to have Maeve stay over.

02:39.799 --> 02:41.400
Why would he be embarrassed?

02:41.400 --> 02:43.679
Perhaps you need
to be a little bit less intense.

02:43.679 --> 02:47.640
You know, like one
of those laid-back, cool, friend mums.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.160
I'm laid-back.

02:50.040 --> 02:53.280
Anyway, I've decided
to give you the money.

02:54.239 --> 02:56.120
Oh my God. Thank you.

02:59.120 --> 02:59.959
What's this?

02:59.959 --> 03:04.920
It's a "sister contract"
so that we both understand the conditions.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.440
It's very, um... long.

03:08.959 --> 03:09.840
Yeah.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.480
Mull it over. Take your time.

03:13.480 --> 03:18.399
There's no rush. And when you sign it,
I'll transfer the money.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.799
You are not laid-back.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.560
I might come in
and register at college today.

03:27.399 --> 03:28.600
Really?

03:29.560 --> 03:30.440
Mm-hmm.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.560
Oh, um, my mum.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.799
<i>Um, can you chat for a minute?</i>

03:38.799 --> 03:41.760
Uh, if this is about O, then no.

03:41.760 --> 03:42.679
<i>It's not.</i>

03:42.679 --> 03:46.160
The show's on hiatus
until that stuff about, you know,

03:46.720 --> 03:48.280
her being deleted gets worked out.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.000
Canceled, Mum.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.200
<i>That's not actually why
I called at all.</i>

03:52.200 --> 03:56.720
I was just wondering if you and Maeve
wanted to come over for dinner tonight.

03:57.519 --> 04:00.480
It would be very relaxed.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.679
Um, you know, laid-back.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.239
<i>Not intense at all.</i>

04:06.239 --> 04:07.399
Okay, let me ask.

04:08.119 --> 04:09.839
Mum's wondering
if you wanna come for dinner.

04:09.839 --> 04:11.440
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.600
I just... I thought, Maeve and I
got off on the wrong foot,

04:14.600 --> 04:17.959
and... well, I'd like
to get to know her better.

04:18.479 --> 04:20.440
She wants to get to know you better.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.640
- Fine.
- Yeah?

04:23.640 --> 04:25.680
<i>- That sounds really nice.</i>
- Oh.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.400
- <i>We'll come over later.</i>
- Good.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.440
Okay, bye.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.280
Sorry, she put me on the spot.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.599
Hmm. Oh.

04:36.599 --> 04:37.720
I'll get it.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.280
- Come in.
- Oh, you're not Jean. Stranger.

04:44.039 --> 04:46.919
Hi, Jean. Got you a skimmed latte,
if I remembered correctly?

04:46.919 --> 04:48.320
- Thanks.
- Nice house!

04:48.919 --> 04:50.800
Except for that tree house out the front.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.080
That's creepy.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.240
My ex built it.

04:53.240 --> 04:56.039
I'm going to take it down.
I just haven't had the chance.

04:56.039 --> 04:58.520
Um, sorry. Have I forgotten something?

04:58.520 --> 04:59.880
I just wanna chat.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.520
I'm... I'm gonna go.

05:04.560 --> 05:05.400
Let's go in here.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.720
How are you feeling about your exam?

06:09.720 --> 06:13.359
I just got an email saying
that there's no record of my sperm donor.

06:13.359 --> 06:16.560
I thought we agreed you were going to wait
until after your exams.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.720
I know you guys
are hiding something from me.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.799
Jackson, we just want you to do well.

06:20.799 --> 06:24.120
It's your final year at college.
You need to stay focused.

06:24.120 --> 06:27.080
- Mum, can you tell me what's going on?
- There's nothing going on.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.280
It's just a mix-up.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.799
Stop staring at me.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.640
You silly, silly Jesus.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.440
Eric!
Your toast is getting burnt!

07:03.440 --> 07:05.599
Should I have bought Joy a "babyccino"?

07:07.239 --> 07:09.919
Look, I wanted to come over
to update you.

07:09.919 --> 07:12.880
Things got a little fruity
down at the station.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.840
And "Terry" is not happy with me at all,

07:15.840 --> 07:19.960
but I still have a lot of faith
that we can make this show work.

07:19.960 --> 07:23.000
We just have to come up
with a plan of action and regroup.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.120
Well, the thing is, Celia, um,

07:26.640 --> 07:29.599
I don't think
I'm the right person for the show.

07:29.599 --> 07:30.599
Oh.

07:30.599 --> 07:32.799
I thought I'd be able
to juggle everything,

07:32.799 --> 07:36.560
and it turns out
that it's a lot harder than I realized.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.960
But the last show was a lot better.
You were finding your groove.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.200
I just need to be a mum right now.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.919
Uh, hi. Hey, everyone.
The fundraiser's coming up,

07:53.919 --> 07:57.000
and we're still looking for people
to help with ticketing and catering,

07:57.000 --> 07:58.560
so shoot me a message if-- Ooh.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.080
you fancy helping out.

08:02.159 --> 08:04.280
You're so brave for outing O.

08:04.280 --> 08:08.159
Yeah, and I accidentally pissed
in my wardrobe when I was drunk once,

08:08.159 --> 08:10.239
so you shouldn't feel embarrassed.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.400
So it's down there for enrollment.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.560
- Okay.
- Good luck.

08:18.719 --> 08:19.919
- See you later.
- Mm-hmm.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.000
Ruby. Hi. Um...

08:33.840 --> 08:37.079
That stuff I said about us and Maeve,
I'm really sorry.

08:37.079 --> 08:39.159
It was pigheaded of me,
and I was panicking,

08:39.159 --> 08:42.199
and that sometimes
makes me say stupid things.

08:42.199 --> 08:45.720
But I... I really think we still have
a chance of winning this thing

08:45.720 --> 08:46.760
if we can move past it.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.280
I'm working for someone new now, Otis.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.360
- Take a badge.
- Stick it in your eye.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.520
Oh, come on. Be reasonable.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.120
- Who put you up to this?
- Nobody. I'm an independent.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.160
You?

09:00.880 --> 09:03.360
No. No, you can't just join the race.
That's against the rules.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.040
There are no rules, Otis.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.160
And Connor is no less worthy
than either of you two.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.600
- But I have had my channel for years.
- No, okay...

09:10.600 --> 09:14.560
- I've been around therapy my entire life.
- Actually, my dad's also a therapist.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.160
And I have my own video channel,
mostly about gaming.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.880
- But Ruby's helping me rebrand.
- Rebrand. Yes.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.199
She took me shopping.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.800
Connor, no one's gonna vote for you.

09:23.800 --> 09:28.640
Sorry. We're more likely to vote for him
than either of you two.

09:28.640 --> 09:29.959
You're both super problematic.

09:29.959 --> 09:31.760
- Excuse me.
- I am not problematic.

09:31.760 --> 09:34.199
And we have free beanies!
Free beanies for everyone!

09:34.199 --> 09:36.920
- Vote Connor! Vote Connor!
- Ah, Jesus.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.120
Vote Connor! Vote Connor!

09:38.120 --> 09:39.440
- Enough.
- Oh yeah!

09:40.520 --> 09:41.800
I've figured it out.

09:42.839 --> 09:43.800
The meaning of life?

09:44.400 --> 09:47.839
No, what I wanna take photos of.
I've taken my first ones. Can I show you?

09:48.600 --> 09:52.280
- Aren't we not supposed to be talking?
- No, Maeve says we can be friends.

09:52.280 --> 09:53.600
Yeah.

09:54.880 --> 09:55.839
Let's go!

<i>Uh, the dodgy one.</i>

10:32.640 --> 10:33.480
Yeah, hi.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.880
<i>Sean asked me to tell you
you need to pick your mum up.</i>

10:37.400 --> 10:38.640
Why, where is he?

10:39.199 --> 10:41.920
<i>He's left, took all his stuff. Um...</i>

10:42.600 --> 10:43.959
<i>All right. Peace out.</i>

10:44.720 --> 10:45.760
Oh.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.440
Oh. Hi, Maeve.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.000
Hi.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.560
I'm sorry about your mum.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.280
Oh, do cock biters get a free pass
when they've got a dead mum?

11:05.280 --> 11:06.320
How gracious.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.480
So,

11:14.360 --> 11:16.959
these are the jeans
I was wearing on that day

11:17.839 --> 11:19.760
when I was assaulted on the bus.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.839
I keep meaning to throw them away,
but for some reason, I can't.

11:27.120 --> 11:31.040
Every day I feel more like myself,
and, like, that's great,

11:31.040 --> 11:32.880
but sometimes, it feels like

11:34.560 --> 11:36.600
even when I'm doing something I love,

11:37.680 --> 11:39.079
like eating ice cream...

11:41.240 --> 11:43.320
it feels like I'm still wearing them.

11:45.199 --> 11:46.719
Like it never goes away.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.959
So, yeah, this is my idea.

11:56.079 --> 11:59.839
These are brilliant.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.600
Well, you've helped so much.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.280
You're gonna be such a great teacher.

- Yes.

13:34.079 --> 13:38.959
It was called Titograd between
1946 to 1992, but we're splitting hairs.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.120
Why were you talking to that guy?

13:49.120 --> 13:52.199
What guy? Oh, he was just
asking me questions about the exam.

13:52.199 --> 13:55.920
Oh, because it looked like you were
coming onto him. That's why.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.199
Uh, I wasn't. Trust me.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.719
- Don't lie to me.
- Geography mock this way.

13:59.719 --> 14:01.880
Oh, I think they're going in, so...

14:03.280 --> 14:05.599
Don't walk away from me.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.640
You're hurting me, Beau.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.320
Ow, s-stop.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.360
What are you doing?

14:14.360 --> 14:17.000
Don't be nervous. You'll smash it.

14:26.439 --> 14:27.319
Hello?

14:29.079 --> 14:30.280
Phone's dead.

14:31.719 --> 14:32.760
Are you sure?

14:33.280 --> 14:37.479
No, I, uh, just fancied staying in here
with you for a wee bit longer, Otis.

14:37.479 --> 14:38.439
Hello?

14:39.040 --> 14:39.959
Hello?

14:40.800 --> 14:41.839
Oh God.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.319
Oh God.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.120
Oh, we're stuck. We are stuck in here.
We're gonna run out of air, O.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.680
We're gonna run out of air and oxygen,
and we might die.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.839
- What are you doing?
- Trying to pretend that you're not here.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.599
AC/DC. AC/DC. Adam and the Ants.

15:07.319 --> 15:09.199
Bowie, David. Carpenters.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.959
Ugh. It was working this morning.

15:12.959 --> 15:15.640
Well, it's not working now.
It's stuck again!

15:17.040 --> 15:20.120
Look, you're gonna be late,
so if you just take the stairs...

15:20.120 --> 15:22.040
No, I'm waiting with you.

15:23.640 --> 15:26.160
Excuse me. Siobhan, hi.

15:26.160 --> 15:29.439
I've got an exam
in exactly ten minutes' time. Upstairs.

15:29.439 --> 15:31.640
And the shitty lift is broken again.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.920
Right.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.040
- I'll get Principal Lakhani.
- Yeah.

15:37.199 --> 15:38.920
I've had enough of this.

15:42.839 --> 15:44.680
- There's mischief in your eyes.
- Hmm.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.560
You are now
under exam conditions.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.640
If you have unauthorized items...

15:50.760 --> 15:52.319
I have not revised.

15:52.319 --> 15:55.439
...electronic device,
you must hand them in now.

15:55.439 --> 15:59.199
If you do not hand them in,
your results may be canceled.

15:59.199 --> 16:01.079
You should have a question paper
on your desk.

16:01.079 --> 16:04.359
Do not open the question paper
until I instruct you to do so.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.880
You'll have 60 minutes
to complete this exam.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.520
Your time starts now.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.400
All right. Stay calm, everyone.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.560
Please make your way to the exit,
and leave your exam papers where they are.

16:30.319 --> 16:33.359
- Oh my God, like, I hate fire.
- Single file. Don't run.

16:35.599 --> 16:37.520
Everybody, please remain calm.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.439
Form two very distinctive lines behind me.

16:40.439 --> 16:44.680
We'll descend the stairs, exit outside,
and gather at the muster point.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.439
- Nothing to worry about.
- Is this gonna be all tough?

16:47.439 --> 16:49.079
Uh...

16:49.079 --> 16:51.120
Right. Uh, that's fine.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.959
Um, we may need to find
an alternative way...

16:53.959 --> 16:55.040
How do we get out?

16:55.040 --> 16:58.400
- We're going to die.
- No one's gonna-- We're not gonna die.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.680
It's annoying, isn't it?

17:00.959 --> 17:03.560
Not being able
to get where you need to go.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.119
What's... What's happening?
This is very disruptive.

17:06.119 --> 17:08.319
- Ros, can you please sort out the alarm?
- On my way.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.680
I've asked nicely multiple times
for the lift to be replaced,

17:11.680 --> 17:13.159
and nothing has changed.

17:13.159 --> 17:16.480
So, yeah, I'm gonna be
a little bit disruptive,

17:16.480 --> 17:20.000
because, quite frankly, I'm fucked off.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.480
I've got other things
I need to be worried about.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.760
Whether I'm gonna
get a good result on my exam.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.319
What I'm gonna have for dinner tonight.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.120
Normal everyday shit.

17:30.120 --> 17:34.240
But instead, I'm here wasting my time

17:34.240 --> 17:38.720
explaining why accessibility is a big deal
when it should be a given.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.280
I thought you fixed it.

17:41.399 --> 17:43.080
Yeah, it's just fucked.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.680
I'm not blaming
any one person specifically.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.760
It's everyone's fault.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.120
- What's happening?
- It's everyone's responsibility.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.800
The lift isn't working. Again.

17:52.800 --> 17:57.159
If this college can afford sound baths,
communal harmony bees...

17:57.159 --> 17:59.000
- Save the bees!
- Sh!

17:59.000 --> 18:02.159
...they can definitely
afford a working lift.

18:02.159 --> 18:04.480
And I know that that's not glamorous,

18:04.480 --> 18:06.560
but it's really important

18:06.560 --> 18:11.000
that when people ask for something
that they need, you listen.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.440
Look, I think this is just
one big misunderstanding.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.640
-"Big misunderstanding."
- We can fix this.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.680
- You come to us with your problems--
- It's not a misunderstanding.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.280
It's an afterthought.

18:24.280 --> 18:27.640
None of you realized
you'd left me behind just now

18:27.640 --> 18:30.040
when college could have burned down.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.159
I used to sign BSL as a kid,

18:33.159 --> 18:37.120
but when I went to secondary school,
the access just wasn't there.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.159
And I was so embarrassed to ask for it.

18:40.159 --> 18:43.640
So I pretend I'm coping
as well as everyone else.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.280
It's so much work.

18:46.280 --> 18:49.480
Lip-reading, having people speak for me,

18:49.480 --> 18:51.120
no notetaker in class.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.040
It's so draining.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.200
I wish people understood

18:55.200 --> 18:59.320
that our problems come
from barriers in society,

18:59.320 --> 19:01.360
not from our disabilities.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.000
- Who is that?
- I'm not sure. I've never seen him before.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.679
I don't think he goes here.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.399
I'm just very passionate.

19:08.399 --> 19:13.080
Look, I'm going to call an engineer,
and we're gonna sort all of this out.

19:13.080 --> 19:17.000
But in the meantime,
please just get back to your exams.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.520
No. Not good enough.

19:20.040 --> 19:23.840
If Isaac can't do his exam,
I won't do my exam.

19:24.440 --> 19:28.159
Yeah. You know what?
We're not moving until it gets fixed.

20:16.040 --> 20:16.960
Ah.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.880
Sean and I were supposed to
scatter them together.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.360
Did he...
Did he say anything before he left?

20:24.040 --> 20:27.159
Just that he wanted to try and get clean.

20:28.120 --> 20:31.200
And, uh, if he was gonna stay here,
he wouldn't be able to do that.

20:31.840 --> 20:32.800
Right, yeah.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.800
What's with the plastic?

20:46.800 --> 20:49.679
- Oh, I've got allergies, you know?
- Oh.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.720
Do you wanna play <i>Temple of Zoltan?</i>

20:56.600 --> 20:58.560
Yeah. Yeah.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.360
So...

21:03.360 --> 21:06.000
You're the pink slug.
I call her Sluggy.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.280
Why am I the slug?

21:07.880 --> 21:09.080
'Cause it's pink.

21:16.919 --> 21:18.320
Hmm.

21:20.679 --> 21:21.800
Wow.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.080
Oh.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.440
Hey, mate. Got your hay delivery,
but your tractor's in the way.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.240
- Can you move it?
- Uh...

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Tell you what.
I'll be out there in a minute.

21:38.880 --> 21:39.840
Tractor.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.159
Okay.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.399
Put that in there.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.040
Okay.

22:30.880 --> 22:31.919
Whoa!

22:37.600 --> 22:39.080
What are you doing?

22:39.080 --> 22:41.560
- What's going on?
- Are you totally incompetent?

22:41.560 --> 22:44.840
Adam, what the hell?
Get down now! Come on, quickly.

22:45.520 --> 22:46.600
What the fuck?

22:46.600 --> 22:47.880
I'm sorry.

22:48.439 --> 22:50.800
I leave you alone for 15 minutes!

22:53.280 --> 22:57.320
"You must keep your promises
and stay true to your core values."

22:58.480 --> 23:00.800
Oh my God, are you kidding me?

23:42.560 --> 23:45.919
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking down the tree house.

23:47.320 --> 23:50.439
Yes, I can see that,
but why are you doing it right now?

23:50.439 --> 23:54.640
Because it's ugly and annoying,
and I don't wanna look at it anymore.

23:57.120 --> 24:00.880
Auntie Jo-Jo will go and help.
Auntie Jo-Jo will go and help. Come on.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.760
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.360
You ever used a hammer before?

24:17.360 --> 24:18.919
I know how to use a hammer.

24:18.919 --> 24:20.320
Just turn it around.

24:20.320 --> 24:23.919
- There's a hook on the other side.
- It's a hammer. I know what I'm doing--

24:26.840 --> 24:29.600
- What have you done?
- You are such a control freak!

24:29.600 --> 24:31.600
No, I'm not! Just get off me!

24:32.120 --> 24:34.280
You have to micromanage everything!

24:34.280 --> 24:40.080
I mean, what kind of person
handwrites a fucking sister contract?

24:40.080 --> 24:42.320
It is anally retentive!

24:42.880 --> 24:45.640
Why can't you just leave me
to use my own judgment?

24:45.640 --> 24:48.200
Because your judgment is famously bad!

24:48.200 --> 24:50.000
And what is that supposed to mean?

24:50.000 --> 24:54.760
Well, okay. How much
was that electric face mask thing?

24:54.760 --> 24:57.600
It was £250, which is actually quite cheap

24:57.600 --> 25:00.840
because it was meant to be £350,
and I got it in a sale.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.080
But you're in debt, Joanna!

25:07.439 --> 25:12.640
I just think that you could... benefit
from some therapy.

25:12.640 --> 25:14.560
Oh my God! Really?

25:14.560 --> 25:15.760
Yes.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.919
I mean, our childhood was not that bad!

25:18.919 --> 25:22.320
Therapy has helped me profoundly,

25:22.320 --> 25:25.919
and I just think that you'd be able
to get some structure in your life.

25:25.919 --> 25:30.040
Yes, yeah, because you have
really got your shit together.

25:30.040 --> 25:34.480
When you're out here
fucking knocking down a tree house

25:34.480 --> 25:37.439
when you should be talking about
the guy who built it,

25:37.439 --> 25:40.120
who thought he was
the father of your child and he wasn't!

25:40.120 --> 25:43.280
How is that person not fucked up?

25:43.280 --> 25:49.280
All I'm saying is that you haven't
dealt with the years of abuse.

25:49.800 --> 25:54.199
And that is why all of this
is just self-sabotage.

25:54.199 --> 25:56.679
Your whole life would be different!

26:01.679 --> 26:02.520

Thanks.

- Hey.
- Hi.

27:13.919 --> 27:17.600
Is anyone hungry? I'm gonna go see
if the canteen will give us any food.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.600
I'm starving. Yeah. I'll come with you.
I'll come with you.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.679
Can you not do that, please?

27:44.679 --> 27:46.560
I really need to get out of here.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.439
Oh, is there somewhere
you're desperate to be?

27:48.439 --> 27:50.360
- Yes, actually.

my mum properly tonight.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.159
Not that it's your business.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.560
It's not poisoned. Don't worry.

28:26.720 --> 28:27.560
Thanks.

28:31.199 --> 28:33.080
We shouldn't have got
something to put on it?

28:33.080 --> 28:35.280
Nah, everyone likes bread.

28:36.159 --> 28:38.320
I've been meaning to ask
if you're doing okay?

28:39.080 --> 28:42.640
Yeah, you know, up and down.
The T's definitely helping.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.040
- And things are better with my mum.
- Good.

28:45.040 --> 28:48.159
Yeah, I get these flashes
of how good things could be,

28:48.919 --> 28:51.040
but then I remember
it's all out of my control.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.040
And then, I don't know.

28:54.040 --> 28:57.800
I remember I can't get the care
that I actually need to live my life.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.240
It's so painful.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.560
So shit.

29:04.199 --> 29:05.600
It is so shit.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.520
I've been thinking
I might just go private.

29:15.679 --> 29:18.480
But I've heard
a lot of different things though.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.120
How much did it cost you?

29:25.399 --> 29:29.120
Uh, mine was about £10,000.
My family paid.

29:29.639 --> 29:30.560
Fuck!

29:32.439 --> 29:34.040
There's no way we can afford that.

29:35.199 --> 29:37.639
- I'm starving. What did you get?
- We have bread.

29:39.439 --> 29:40.919
Is there any filling, or...

29:42.120 --> 29:42.959
Just bread?

29:42.959 --> 29:44.720
- Ooh.
- Thanks.

29:45.320 --> 29:46.760
- Just bread?
- Just bread.

29:48.639 --> 29:50.840
Mmm. Mmm.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.480
Oh.

29:55.080 --> 29:55.959
There you go.

29:58.399 --> 30:00.120
- Yo.
- Hey.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.919
Would you like some bread?

30:10.720 --> 30:12.000
Are you okay?

30:19.240 --> 30:22.919
- Babe.
- I keep seeing things, Abbi.

30:23.840 --> 30:28.240
Like, I am getting signs from God.

30:29.399 --> 30:33.000
God is telling me that
I shouldn't turn my back on my community.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.840
That I should get baptized.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.480
I just-- I don't know what to do.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.000
Do you want to get baptized?

30:42.919 --> 30:44.840
Yes, but I feel guilty for that.

30:46.040 --> 30:50.520
Like, look at everyone out there
literally fighting for who they are.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.919
Why can't I be like that?

30:56.280 --> 31:00.439
Sometimes I would give anything
to go back to my church.

31:01.959 --> 31:04.560
It was my whole world,
and I miss it so much.

31:06.320 --> 31:09.240
Not everyone can fight, Eric,
and that's okay.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.720
Whatever you decide, I'll support you.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.199
Let's pray on it together.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.040
I just wanted to say

31:35.320 --> 31:38.199
thank you for everything you've taught me

31:38.199 --> 31:39.800
before I go.

31:39.800 --> 31:40.720
What?

31:41.520 --> 31:43.080
What are you talking about?

31:44.480 --> 31:48.280
Well, you know, I'm gonna be fired now,
and I just wanna say thank you.

31:48.280 --> 31:51.080
Fired? Adam. You're not fired.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.399
Look, I think
you're really good at this job.

31:53.399 --> 31:56.760
And today aside,
I think you show good instincts.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.040
So I'm not fired?

31:59.800 --> 32:01.000
No.

32:02.199 --> 32:06.080
But you will be if you keep standing there
wasting my time asking if you're fired.

32:07.480 --> 32:10.360
And don't ever get on that tractor again.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.840
Oh yeah, understood.

32:24.199 --> 32:25.959
You are so dramatic!

32:25.959 --> 32:28.719
I don't know why
I thought I could ever live with you.

32:28.719 --> 32:32.040
Well, maybe because the alternative
is being homeless,

32:32.040 --> 32:34.240
and I was kind enough to take you in.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.919
- Take me in?
- Yes.

32:35.919 --> 32:38.639
Do you know that Otis,
he begged me to come here

32:38.639 --> 32:40.520
because you are all over the place?

32:40.520 --> 32:44.520
Ha! You have only ever shown up
when it suited you, Jo,

32:44.520 --> 32:46.879
because you are fundamentally selfish.

32:46.879 --> 32:49.280
- I'm selfish?
- Yes.

32:49.280 --> 32:50.840
Dan might be the one,

32:50.840 --> 32:53.800
and you are forbidding me from seeing him!

32:53.800 --> 32:59.320
Every guy you have ever dated has been
the one, Jo, until you run away.

32:59.320 --> 33:00.560
Oh, piss off!

33:00.560 --> 33:02.760
- You piss off!
- No, you piss off!

33:03.679 --> 33:04.800
Pissy knickers!

33:08.240 --> 33:09.159
Jo!

33:09.760 --> 33:13.760
Oh shit. Let's talk about it!
This is ridiculous!

33:13.760 --> 33:17.120
Jo, why won't you talk about it?

33:17.840 --> 33:21.399
Oh, Jo. If you leave now,
there's no coming back.

33:21.399 --> 33:24.080
Oh, don't worry! I'm not coming back!

33:24.080 --> 33:26.360
So much for helping your sister in need!

33:26.360 --> 33:30.320
Do you know you are pathologically
incapable of accepting help!

33:30.320 --> 33:31.399
That's so not true.

33:31.399 --> 33:35.760
And your sister contract can kiss my arse!

33:38.800 --> 33:40.360
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.120
Come in.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.959
That's better, mud free.

34:06.520 --> 34:11.480
You caught my sister and I
in an unfortunate moment before.

34:13.560 --> 34:16.679
Siblings can really
push each other's buttons.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.199
Otis told me that you lost your mum.

34:24.199 --> 34:25.960
I'm so sorry.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.520
It's okay. She's not lost. She's dead.

34:29.520 --> 34:32.799
I wish people would stop saying sorry.
It's fucking annoying.

34:33.799 --> 34:34.639
Isn't it?

34:39.760 --> 34:41.880
I should go. This was a mistake, I think.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.600
No, I really want to get to know you,

34:45.600 --> 34:48.360
and... I said the wrong thing.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.199
I'm just not myself at the moment.

34:51.199 --> 34:52.520
Of course you aren't.

34:52.520 --> 34:56.199
I mean, when I lost my mum,
I felt so disjointed.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.600
It's like my center had completely gone.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.400
We had a very difficult relationship.

35:07.319 --> 35:10.839
I still couldn't make sense of
the world without her.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.720
Did Otis tell you anything else
about my mum?

35:15.799 --> 35:16.640
No.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.480
She was a drug addict.

35:18.480 --> 35:20.520
Oh, that must've been so hard for you.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.160
I feel relieved

35:26.480 --> 35:27.600
that she's gone.

35:29.839 --> 35:32.400
It's not uncommon
for people to feel relief,

35:32.400 --> 35:34.960
particularly when there's
childhood trauma.

35:35.720 --> 35:38.720
- So I'm not a terrible person, then?
- No.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.720
Try not to be hard on yourself.

35:46.360 --> 35:47.520
Can I help with anything?

35:48.040 --> 35:51.160
Yes. How are you at peeling?

35:51.160 --> 35:55.080
Um, yeah. Grade-A peeler.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.360
I thought your girlfriend lived
in America?

36:04.440 --> 36:06.680
Ah, come on. I'm only making conversation.

36:08.960 --> 36:13.640
No, she's moving back to Moordale.
She's gonna start studying at Cavendish.

36:14.799 --> 36:17.160
I thought she was
doing that impressive course thing?

36:17.160 --> 36:18.560
What's your point?

36:18.560 --> 36:19.560
Mm-mm.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.319
Just seems a bit strange.

36:22.480 --> 36:26.240
She must really like spending time
with you to give all that up.

36:26.240 --> 36:30.240
Well, yeah, she does, actually.
We are pretty happy.

36:30.240 --> 36:32.920
Things are going mostly great between us.

36:33.440 --> 36:34.400
"Mostly"?

36:37.440 --> 36:39.480
Are you still having
that sex phobia stuff?

36:39.480 --> 36:40.400
What?

36:40.400 --> 36:42.480
I read that thing
your mum wrote about you.

36:42.480 --> 36:43.920
It's really fascinating.

36:43.920 --> 36:47.040
That is so unbelievably inappropriate.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.920
So I'll take that as a yes, then?

36:48.920 --> 36:53.359
Yeah, sure.
We're having some issues.

36:53.359 --> 36:54.400
Sex issues?

36:55.319 --> 36:56.440
Yeah, I...

36:57.880 --> 36:58.920
Yeah, I have this thing.

36:58.920 --> 37:02.640
I <i>had</i> this thing where
I would just get very anxious around sex,

37:02.640 --> 37:03.960
but I dealt with it.

37:04.680 --> 37:07.120
But now it's back,
and I don't understand why.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.359
Mmm.

37:08.359 --> 37:10.440
No, I'm not... we're not doing this.

37:10.440 --> 37:14.040
I'm not. What am I doing, Otis?
I'm not doing anything.

37:14.040 --> 37:17.040
Why don't we talk about you for a change?

37:18.040 --> 37:18.960
What about me?

37:19.480 --> 37:21.760
Well, I don't know
literally anything about you.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.319
Well, have you ever asked?

37:24.040 --> 37:24.880
No.

37:24.880 --> 37:27.280
Then, what happened with Ruby?
Why don't we start there?

37:27.280 --> 37:29.240
Do you have any idea how awful she felt?

37:29.240 --> 37:32.080
Oh please, Otis.
Don't pretend like you care about her.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.040
You're literally using her
'cause you want to win the election.

37:35.839 --> 37:38.120
How about everything you've said,

37:38.120 --> 37:41.319
making me out to be some kind of meninist.

37:41.319 --> 37:44.120
You got on my mum's radio show.
You literally don't stop.

37:44.120 --> 37:47.799
Like, are you asexual, or was that just
something else to make me look bad?

37:51.280 --> 37:54.560
That's a really, really fucked up thing
to say, Otis.

38:06.120 --> 38:08.600
Otis told me about
the course that you're on.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.160
Sounds prestigious.

38:11.760 --> 38:14.960
- When do you go back?
- Uh, I'm not going back, actually.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.480
I was gonna register at Cavendish today,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.760
but I don't know
if I'm gonna go back to college either.

38:20.760 --> 38:21.839
It's a big decision.

38:24.160 --> 38:28.440
Yeah. I actually might just get a job,
you know, something secure.

38:29.560 --> 38:30.560
Sounds sensible.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.680
What do you really want to do?

38:35.680 --> 38:37.319
I wanted to be a writer.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.160
Kind of realized it's just so competitive,

38:41.160 --> 38:43.480
and my tutor told me
I wasn't cut out for it.

38:43.480 --> 38:46.560
I'm not gonna waste my time on something
if I'm not good enough, you know?

38:46.560 --> 38:48.400
Doesn't make any sense. Fuck!

38:49.000 --> 38:50.120
Oh. Ooh.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.200
- Hold on. Hold it under there.
- It's fine.

38:52.799 --> 38:53.760
Let's have a look.

38:53.760 --> 38:54.760
Ah.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.080
Sorry.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.720
- I don't think it's deep.
- It's fine.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.480
I don't know why I'm crying.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.080
Such a baby.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.480
It's okay to cry.

39:08.319 --> 39:09.359
It really is.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.000
All right.

39:14.839 --> 39:16.839
- Sorry.
- No, don't be sorry.

39:17.359 --> 39:19.760
Why don't you sit there? We've got...

39:22.799 --> 39:24.240
I just feel so stupid.

39:25.319 --> 39:28.200
I kind of convinced myself
that I was special or something,

39:28.200 --> 39:31.359
like I deserved to be there
with those people. I'm just an idiot.

39:34.480 --> 39:37.280
This might hurt a little bit.

39:38.480 --> 39:41.480
Now I don't know you very well, Maeve,

39:41.480 --> 39:44.319
but it seems to me
that you're the kind of person

39:44.319 --> 39:47.920
who has raised herself
from a very young age.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.319
And from what I can tell,

39:51.520 --> 39:53.440
you're doing a very good job.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.359
But sometimes
when we haven't been parented securely,

39:57.359 --> 40:01.080
we can suffer from low self-esteem.

40:03.240 --> 40:06.040
Now, you've taken quite a knock,

40:06.040 --> 40:09.200
and that kind of rejection
can feel very painful.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.560
But I would say that

40:12.520 --> 40:15.960
you were good enough
to get into the course in the first place,

40:16.560 --> 40:22.520
and I reckon that you are just as worthy
of succeeding as anybody else there.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.560
Really?

40:27.520 --> 40:28.480
Thank you.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.000
Why don't you use this?

40:33.280 --> 40:36.560
I think that what you probably need
is someone in your corner,

40:37.240 --> 40:40.440
a parent to tell you
to pick yourself back up,

40:41.120 --> 40:42.839
to stay resilient,

40:43.680 --> 40:45.760
to keep believing in yourself.

40:47.880 --> 40:51.520
And not to let
one teacher dictate your future.

40:53.920 --> 40:55.359
Okay.

41:03.160 --> 41:06.359
You know, I do feel awful
about what I did to Ruby.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.359
Why did you do it?

41:10.839 --> 41:15.120
I'd just moved from Belfast,
and I was the kid with the funny accent.

41:15.120 --> 41:18.040
I was one of
the only kids of color in my year,

41:18.040 --> 41:22.400
and I already started feeling
like something wasn't normal.

41:23.880 --> 41:27.920
The other girls were talking about boys
and kissing and crushes and...

41:29.960 --> 41:34.440
There was... There was so much pressure
to behave a particular way,

41:34.440 --> 41:36.680
and I decided that

41:37.400 --> 41:39.839
I needed to become best friends
with the popular girls

41:39.839 --> 41:42.160
so that people didn't notice
that I didn't fit in.

41:43.760 --> 41:48.440
<i>Then I started learning everything I could
about sex and relationships</i>

41:48.440 --> 41:52.200
<i>so that I could pretend
to be like everyone else.</i>

41:53.799 --> 41:56.880
<i>I was quite surprised
that I found it quite fascinating, but</i>

41:58.280 --> 42:01.400
<i>you know, keeping up that facade
was really hard, and...</i>

42:03.400 --> 42:04.839
<i>it is exhausting...</i>

42:07.319 --> 42:09.200
<i>not being able to be yourself.</i>

42:15.400 --> 42:17.600
What are you looking at, bed-wetter?

42:23.600 --> 42:26.720
And when I got into college,
I set up my clinic, and

42:27.480 --> 42:31.000
I still didn't feel like
I could tell people that I was ace.

42:33.920 --> 42:37.560
I mean, who wants to have sex advice
from someone who doesn't have sex?

42:41.480 --> 42:43.440
Sounds like it'd be quite lonely.

42:43.440 --> 42:44.480
Yeah.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.960
I did try to make friends.

42:49.200 --> 42:52.080
But I couldn't let people in
without giving myself away.

42:53.600 --> 42:55.839
So I decided
that I was just better off alone.

42:55.839 --> 42:58.640
I mean, I didn't need anything
except my clinic.

42:59.560 --> 43:02.080
That was my passion. It was my safe place.

43:03.400 --> 43:06.600
Then you just came in
and took everything away from me.

43:10.600 --> 43:11.920
<i>Doors opening.</i>

43:14.480 --> 43:17.839
Fucking Nora. We didn't know
there was anybody in here.

43:23.680 --> 43:24.720
Thank you.

43:27.480 --> 43:30.359
The lift is fixed.

43:40.920 --> 43:43.319
Does that mean
we don't have to do our exam anymore?

43:43.319 --> 43:46.319
Well, the exam,
that's been rescheduled to tomorrow.

43:46.319 --> 43:47.680
Aw, what?

43:47.680 --> 43:50.040
We're putting some funding
into replacing the lift.

43:50.040 --> 43:51.120
About time.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.960
- We did it.
- Yeah.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.200
That was thrilling.

43:59.799 --> 44:00.799
Um,

44:01.480 --> 44:02.799
do you wanna hang out?

44:06.000 --> 44:10.319
Sorry, uh, I thought I was feeling better,
but I'm a bit all over the place,

44:11.080 --> 44:15.400
so maybe I just need
to sleep it off or something.

44:15.400 --> 44:19.000
Okay, um, I'm here if you need me.

44:19.520 --> 44:20.359
Yeah.

44:23.879 --> 44:24.720
Thanks.

44:41.400 --> 44:45.040
Hey, um, I've been thinking
about your penis problem.

44:45.560 --> 44:48.040
Okay. I don't really need
your input for that.

44:48.040 --> 44:51.120
Right, but your mum said
that your dad left when you were younger.

44:51.120 --> 44:53.520
- And that she really struggled.
- Yeah, she did.

44:53.520 --> 44:57.440
She had a breakdown, basically.
It was terrible. What's your point?

44:57.440 --> 45:00.799
Well, I don't think
that you're afraid of having sex, Otis.

45:01.319 --> 45:04.680
I think you're afraid you're gonna
get your heart broken like your mum did.

45:06.280 --> 45:08.760
And I know that you don't really
want advice from me,

45:08.760 --> 45:11.200
but I think you should just
let that fear go,

45:11.200 --> 45:13.480
'cause you can't love anyone without risk.

45:14.319 --> 45:15.839
Stop getting in the way of yourself.

45:17.480 --> 45:18.879
Ruby, help! Make them stop.

45:18.879 --> 45:22.400
It's okay. One at a time.
Okay, right. We will get to all of you.

45:22.400 --> 45:24.520
I can't believe
he's actually gonna win this thing.

45:24.520 --> 45:26.600
Yep. Guess that's my karma.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.359
I know you made a mistake.

45:31.080 --> 45:34.319
But no one's better off alone.
You should just apologize.

45:35.799 --> 45:38.120
Yeah, well, see you around, Otis.

45:48.839 --> 45:49.799
Adam.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.240
I've been trying to call you.

46:03.359 --> 46:05.120
- Are you all right?
- No!

46:07.120 --> 46:08.200
No, I'm not.

46:11.839 --> 46:15.879
I messed up at work today,
and the first thing that I thought

46:15.879 --> 46:17.560
is I'm going to disappoint my dad.

46:19.120 --> 46:24.319
You have made me feel like
I'm shit at everything since I was born.

46:24.319 --> 46:27.520
I don't wanna feel like a failure anymore
because I'm not a failure.

46:27.520 --> 46:28.799
You're a failure.

46:28.799 --> 46:32.720
You are just a sad man
who does a job that he hates

46:32.720 --> 46:34.960
because he's too afraid
to do anything else.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.839
I thought you were interested in me,
but you weren't.

46:41.839 --> 46:45.040
It was all just about
getting back together with Mum.

46:45.040 --> 46:47.359
- Adam, that's not true.
- It is true.

46:49.680 --> 46:53.160
You don't like me,
so just stop pretending.

47:08.359 --> 47:09.319
Anyone home?

47:15.720 --> 47:16.720
Mum?

47:35.839 --> 47:37.080
Whoa.

48:00.560 --> 48:01.520
Jerome?

48:06.200 --> 48:07.560
I'm home!

48:08.200 --> 48:09.560
- Hello, darling.
- Hi.

48:09.560 --> 48:13.080
Hi. Sorry. I'm so late.

48:14.920 --> 48:15.760
It's all right.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.359
Hi. Uh, I got stuck in a lift.

48:18.359 --> 48:21.000
Oh. Maeve and I
have been having a nice time.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.319
Mm-hmm.

48:22.319 --> 48:24.200
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

48:25.799 --> 48:28.760
- Shall we eat?
- Please. I'm starving.

the best version of me.

it would be too hard.

54:54.760 --> 54:56.240
I'm going back to America.

54:57.839 --> 54:59.839
I have to put something right
before I leave.

55:09.600 --> 55:11.160
I owe you both an apology.

55:12.280 --> 55:14.920
I've been acting like a tiny baby child
for the past couple of weeks,

55:14.920 --> 55:16.720
and I realize I wasn't upset

55:16.720 --> 55:18.879
at the thought
of you two being together at all.

55:19.399 --> 55:22.200
I was more upset
at the idea of losing you both.

55:23.440 --> 55:26.200
I kind of realized
that you're the only family I have left.

55:26.200 --> 55:28.760
Maeve, you could never lose us. Ever.

55:28.760 --> 55:29.799
No.

55:30.960 --> 55:31.960
Okay, good.

55:33.839 --> 55:36.920
I think you two
should definitely explore this.

55:37.440 --> 55:40.280
You don't need my permission,
but it makes a lot of sense.

55:44.120 --> 55:47.960
And also, um, would you mind helping me
scatter my mum's ashes today?

55:51.440 --> 55:52.680
- Right. Yeah.
- Of course.

55:53.760 --> 55:56.240
Thanks. Okay. We can stop being weird now.
