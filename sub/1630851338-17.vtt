♪ ♪

00:51.218 --> 00:52.684
Thank you.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.623
Bloody hell.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.693
Inspector?

01:01.729 --> 01:04.163
Ah, mrs. Hart!
What a lovely surprise.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.965
- Going on holiday, sir?
- Uh, not quite.

01:06.967 --> 01:09.568
Margaret's in niagara
visiting her sister.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.104
For some unbeknown reason,
I'm required to join her.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.939
(chuckles)

01:14.074 --> 01:15.574
Oh, excuse my manners.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.110
Inspector brackenreid,
this is cassiopeia bright.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.112
Entrepreneur and owner
of the star bright club.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.582
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.517
A club owner, how exciting.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.586
What is all this?
Where are you all headed?

01:28.622 --> 01:30.656
Are you assuming that all the
coloured people on this train

01:30.791 --> 01:31.990
Are headed to the same place?

01:32.126 --> 01:34.193
Uhh...

01:34.328 --> 01:35.828
Don't worry, we are indeed.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.328
(both laugh)

01:37.364 --> 01:39.531
We're going to see
w.E.B. Du bois--

01:39.567 --> 01:40.932
Pronounced du-boise.

01:41.001 --> 01:41.933
Oh, is that a fact?

01:41.969 --> 01:44.670
Oh, dr. Du bois
and booker t. Washington

01:44.805 --> 01:47.339
Are speaking at today's
niagara movement meeting.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.141
It's a once in a lifetime event.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.175
Who?

01:50.310 --> 01:52.811
Oh, good heavens.
The civil rights leaders.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.547
Ah, of course.
Please forgive me.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.683
Dr. Du bois founded
the niagara movement.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.419
My father attended
the inaugural meeting in 1905,

02:00.554 --> 02:02.354
At the erie beach hotel.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.889
- They're american, aren't they?
- Yes.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.892
Why are they coming to canada
for the occasion?

02:08.329 --> 02:10.028
Apparently, the hotels south of
the border refused to host them.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.229
Ah.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.299
I reckon we're a lot more
tolerant up here in canada.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.971
You people need to go back
to where you came from!

02:19.106 --> 02:21.039
Let's make our way inside.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.108
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

02:23.177 --> 02:25.511
- We don't want you here!
- May I help you gentlemen?

02:25.646 --> 02:28.046
Yeah, you and your kind need to
get the hell out of my town.

02:28.082 --> 02:31.316
Sir, we've rented this venue
and have every right to be here.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.051
You don't belong!

02:33.120 --> 02:34.586
Go back across
the border and keep going.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.256
Why don't you leave?
You're the damned problem!

02:37.391 --> 02:38.891
What you say, boy?

02:39.026 --> 02:40.725
Watch your tongue,
or you'll lose it!

02:40.794 --> 02:41.960
No, no!

02:42.029 --> 02:43.395
Gentlemen.

02:43.530 --> 02:47.365
Gentlemen, you are carrying on
like a bunch of cats in a sack.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.937
I assure you, sir,
our people will be no trouble.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.639
If you and your lot
don't clear out,

02:53.774 --> 02:56.341
Can't be responsible
for what'll happen.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.677
(crowd member):
That's right.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.759
Here you are.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.430
What have you got there, harry?

03:19.466 --> 03:22.568
A rat trap.
I call it the rat-o-matic.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.237
It's my project
for the science fair.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.973
Are you sure this is how you
want to spend

03:28.042 --> 03:29.374
Your last weekend
in toronto?

03:29.410 --> 03:30.575
We could do something fun!

03:30.578 --> 03:32.911
What's more fun
than inventing?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.649
A boy after my own heart.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.718
Tell me all about this.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.588
It's an enclosure
with an automatic door

03:43.624 --> 03:46.457
Triggered by the photoelectric
sensors inside.

03:46.493 --> 03:47.525
No!

03:49.463 --> 03:52.130
It beeps to alert you so you
can release your catch.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.999
(ogden): Why would you
want to release it?

03:54.068 --> 03:57.803
This trap is perfect for
collecting scientific specimens.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.338
What do you mean?

04:00.474 --> 04:02.707
Subjects for experimentation
and dissection.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.576
Rats are usually so
hard to catch alive.

04:09.984 --> 04:12.284
Have you had
any false triggers?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.386
Yes.

04:14.388 --> 04:17.322
The door keeps closing before
the rats get all the way inside.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.459
Perhaps you'll want to
adjust your arrangement.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.362
William, let him do it.

04:23.364 --> 04:26.031
I'm sure the boy
wants to win, julia.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.033
What do you suggest?

04:31.705 --> 04:35.707
Perhaps you want to
put your sensors

04:35.842 --> 04:37.442
In an x formation.

04:37.577 --> 04:39.111
This would increase the surface
area

04:39.113 --> 04:40.379
That the rat gets to walk on

04:40.514 --> 04:42.613
Prior to triggering
the sensors.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.483
It's just one idea.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.386
With that in mind,

04:48.455 --> 04:52.190
I want to announce that
the niagara movement

04:52.259 --> 04:53.658
Will be
abolished.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.993
(all murmuring)

04:54.995 --> 04:56.094
(crowd member):
What?

04:56.163 --> 04:58.396
(light applause)

04:58.432 --> 05:01.933
To make way for
a new organization

05:01.969 --> 05:04.736
Called the
national association

05:04.738 --> 05:07.205
For the advancement
of colored people.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.874
The naacp.

05:11.312 --> 05:14.913
We will fight for equal
job opportunities

05:16.016 --> 05:18.550
And voting rights
nationwide.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.719
Never pick a fight you
can't win, du bois.

05:20.788 --> 05:23.621
The great accommodator,
ladies and gentlemen!

05:23.657 --> 05:25.023
Booker t.
Washington.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.625
(applause)

05:26.760 --> 05:28.760
Why, thank you, dr. Du bois.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.530
I feel just like
a pig in slop.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.766
(crowd laughs)

05:34.835 --> 05:37.302
Ladies and gentlemen,
do not be led astray

05:37.371 --> 05:39.504
By unrealistic
promises.

05:39.639 --> 05:42.774
This man will tear down
all the good work

05:42.810 --> 05:44.876
We have done
down south.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.912
We tear things down
to build anew.

05:47.948 --> 05:48.980
(crowd member):
That's right!

05:49.049 --> 05:51.182
There is a compromise in place.

05:52.252 --> 05:54.519
We adhere to the law
in exchange for jobs,

05:54.654 --> 05:56.721
Safety
and education.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.324
Our survival depends on this.

05:59.326 --> 06:02.461
Your compromise hasn't
stopped the race riots.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.864
You're just a fool seeking
favour from your master.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.566
We are outnumbered ten to one.

06:09.469 --> 06:12.804
Fighting is suicide and you,

06:12.939 --> 06:14.439
You will never be
on the front line.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.408
Don't speak to my constitution.

06:16.410 --> 06:19.411
Well, I will speak to
whoever I please.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.147
Or do you not value freedom?

06:22.149 --> 06:24.015
(distant scream)

06:24.885 --> 06:26.050
(crowd member):
You hear that?

06:32.292 --> 06:34.358
- One of us is down.
- (hart): Cassie, look.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.834
(cassie):
Is he?

06:51.178 --> 06:53.044
Excuse me.
Please do not touch the body.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.115
The name's isaiah buchanan,
private detective.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.450
Who may you be?

06:58.519 --> 07:01.186
Violet hart, head coroner
at the toronto morgue.

07:01.255 --> 07:04.789
Oh, toronto is lucky to have
a coroner as beautiful as you.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.525
Smart and capable one, too.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.659
Indeed. I defer to your
expertise, madam.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.762
There's a contusion
on his forehead.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.732
See markings here
on his neck, as well.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.601
Several small cuts.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.203
Consistent with strangulation.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.139
Odd.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.073
(buchanan):
What is it?

07:23.644 --> 07:25.076
An obituary?

07:25.145 --> 07:26.811
Of a coloured woman.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.214
There's petrol and matches here.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.883
The locals were none too
pleased about the meeting today.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.486
Do you think he was trying
to set a fire to scare us?

07:34.488 --> 07:36.288
And got killed before
he got the chance.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.623
What is this symbol
supposed to be?

07:38.758 --> 07:40.558
I'd suggest it's a warning.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.293
Get away from that body!

07:42.329 --> 07:44.629
Sirs, my name
is mrs. Violet hart.

07:44.764 --> 07:47.432
I serve as the coroner
for the city of toronto.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.234
I didn't ask for your
life story, sweetheart.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.635
I asked you to back up.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.704
Well, would you like to hear
my findings thus far?

07:52.839 --> 07:55.640
Not your jurisdiction and none
of your damned business.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.176
Constable jope, this is
ethan lowell, isn't it?

07:58.311 --> 08:00.111
Hmm. In the flesh.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.046
You.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.514
How do you know him?

08:02.516 --> 08:03.448
I don't, sir.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.149
Then why were you
messing with his body?

08:05.185 --> 08:07.051
As I said, I am a coroner.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.586
I thought I could
lend my expertise

08:08.655 --> 08:09.921
As I was the most
qualified person

08:10.056 --> 08:11.322
On the scene
at the time.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.524
She was trying to help.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.994
Quite full of yourselves,
aren't ya?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.795
You want to know what I think?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.264
I think you two were up here

08:19.399 --> 08:21.199
Covering up your
own wrongdoings.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.202
With all due respect, inspector,
if I were to kill a man,

08:24.337 --> 08:26.037
I wouldn't be so sloppy.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.044
This is bad.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.080
The police aren't going to take
kindly to a dead white man

08:35.082 --> 08:36.147
Winding up here with us.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.549
And it looked like
they knew him.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.917
We need to investigate
on our own

08:39.052 --> 08:41.018
To ensure this case
doesn't end in disaster.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.154
I could ask around
amongst the attendees,

08:43.156 --> 08:44.823
Try and get ahead
of the police.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.925
And I have some connections
at the station house

08:46.927 --> 08:48.026
That I can use.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.694
And you'll share with
us what you find?

08:49.763 --> 08:51.396
Certainly. I'll let you
know what I find out.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.435
Well, la-di-da.

08:57.437 --> 08:58.903
What?

08:59.706 --> 09:00.905
He likes you.

09:02.609 --> 09:03.842
Can't you tell?

09:03.977 --> 09:06.111
No, he doesn't
and I'm married.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.014
I don't think that'll
be a problem for him.

09:22.396 --> 09:25.330
Not many children have
qualified for this competition.

09:25.399 --> 09:28.533
The finest young inventors
in the city, I'd wager.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.337
They only choose three
people for the finals.

09:32.472 --> 09:33.871
I hope I make it.

09:33.873 --> 09:36.041
(murdoch): You'll have
just as good a chance as any.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.276
Well, better, I should hope.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.279
He is the son of the great
inventor, william murdoch.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.348
(laughs)

09:43.417 --> 09:44.349
What is that?

09:45.552 --> 09:46.952
It's a flying device.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.887
I call it the twisty top.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.489
What does it do?

09:51.558 --> 09:52.824
It flies.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.804
(laughs)

10:05.806 --> 10:08.239
Oh, that is fantastic,
young lady!

10:08.375 --> 10:10.508
How did you even
conceive of this?

10:10.577 --> 10:12.510
This is quite something.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.178
It's just a flying top.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.181
Correction: It's a hovering top

10:16.316 --> 10:19.050
With a battery-operated
propeller.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.853
- It's marvelous, young lady.
- Thank you.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.588
You should be an engineer
when you grow up.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.523
There are girl engineers?

10:25.525 --> 10:27.625
There are some.
You could be one of them!

10:27.628 --> 10:30.729
Oh, I don't know. I just
make these things for fun.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.364
This is ingenious, young lady.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.400
How did you even
conceive of this?

10:35.535 --> 10:37.468
You think her invention
is better than mine?

10:37.504 --> 10:39.203
No! No, no, no.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.739
It's flashy, is all.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.408
Yours is far more practical.
Rats.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.978
People like flashy things.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.949
Well, yes, but what would one
even do with a spinning top

10:51.084 --> 10:53.784
That mimics da vinci's
revolutionary flying machine?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.153
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.320
It would just...

10:58.392 --> 11:00.692
Both of these
inventions are great!

11:00.827 --> 11:03.327
It doesn't have to
be a competition.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.697
But it is a competition.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.365
Right.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.368
But you should both be proud
no matter where you place.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.104
How about a wager?

11:13.140 --> 11:14.739
What shall we bet on?

11:16.643 --> 11:18.109
Whoever places lower in the fair

11:18.178 --> 11:20.445
Has to buy the other
a banana split.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.082
Deal.

11:30.657 --> 11:34.325
We'd best get ready to give
harry money for two banana spl--

11:34.327 --> 11:35.593
Shh!

11:41.067 --> 11:43.401
I'm quite certain that
mr. Washington and his group

11:43.536 --> 11:44.469
Are all innocent.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.003
All of them?

11:46.005 --> 11:48.540
You can't possibly know that
after one conversation.

11:48.675 --> 11:49.874
I was seated with them
at the front

11:49.943 --> 11:51.743
And we were all together
and accounted for.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.811
Oh.
You're a bookerite.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.013
I see.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.482
I take it you prefer
the philosophy

11:57.484 --> 11:59.150
Of dr. Du bois, mrs. Hart?

11:59.219 --> 12:02.353
Indeed. I've never been
a 'go along to get along' woman.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.155
Well, following the rules
is not going along.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.224
You have to take things
step by step,

12:06.293 --> 12:09.294
Be willing to work with people
to make the changes you want.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.128
That starts with
following the law.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.232
The laws were not
written for us.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.033
Instead, they're used
to harass us.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.501
Laws bring order to the chaos,

12:17.537 --> 12:19.570
It makes sure
everyone's in step.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.572
It allows others
to step on our necks.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.711
Did you all realize that mr.
Harper wasn't in the ballroom

12:26.780 --> 12:29.313
The entire time that
dr. Du bois was on stage?

12:29.382 --> 12:30.982
The same man that
had the scuffle

12:30.984 --> 12:32.517
With mr. Lowell
this morning?

12:32.586 --> 12:34.519
Sounds like we have
our first suspect.

12:35.721 --> 12:39.190
Mr. Harper, where were
you during the murder?

12:39.259 --> 12:43.127
I was down in the kitchens
making lunch preparations.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.264
Mr. Harper does have
a temper like firewater.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.698
What are you implying?

12:47.734 --> 12:49.767
Uh, no need to hurl
accusations,

12:49.836 --> 12:51.836
You have some nerve,
mr. Washington!

12:51.972 --> 12:54.071
You and your group only came
here to disrupt the meeting

12:54.107 --> 12:55.406
And stop the naacp.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.941
Y'all probably did it.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.210
Mr. Harper, my followers and I
would never

12:59.279 --> 13:00.678
Do anything
of the sort.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.948
As much as du bois
and I squabble,

13:04.785 --> 13:06.417
Our goals
remain the same.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.889
It's dr. Du bois,
thank you very much.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.957
And our goals are
far from aligned.

13:13.092 --> 13:14.826
So, you will have us stay
stagnant

13:14.961 --> 13:17.162
While I'm moving
the race into the future.

13:17.297 --> 13:21.432
Incorrect. I want us to stay
alive as we move forward.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.501
Why are we even listening
to these two?

13:23.503 --> 13:26.170
Who do you think you are?

13:26.206 --> 13:28.439
Please, we're just trying
to gather enough information

13:28.508 --> 13:30.708
To make sure that this
investigation goes fairly.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.978
See, du bois,
this is what you can do

13:33.980 --> 13:35.646
When you work
within the system.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.051
Well, they can
investigate all they want,

13:40.053 --> 13:41.919
But the cops
won't help them.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.189
By god, du bois,

13:44.324 --> 13:47.458
You don't even have
faith in your own people?

13:47.594 --> 13:51.028
Mr. Washington.
We have a few questions for you.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.698
Did you leave the ballroom
at any time for any reason?

13:56.636 --> 13:58.202
I did not.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.337
You sure?

13:59.472 --> 14:03.875
Gentlemen, there, uh, must
be a huge misunderstanding.

14:03.944 --> 14:07.211
We're, uh, all reasonable
people here.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.180
Mr. Washington was in front
of me in the ballroom

14:09.249 --> 14:10.481
For the entire event.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.950
He could not have left
without everyone seeing him.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.719
I'm conducting
an interview here.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.555
Don't interrupt me again, boy.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.757
Step back.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.426
Apologies, sir.

14:22.962 --> 14:24.128
Inspector.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.036
- He has a walking stick.
- Yes, he does.

14:35.775 --> 14:39.010
Why would anyone want a rat trap
that spares the rat?

14:40.313 --> 14:42.579
When do we get to kill
the pesky little bugger, hm?

14:42.616 --> 14:45.482
It's for people
who love animals.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.820
Well, rats aren't animals,
they're pests.

14:49.923 --> 14:52.990
But, I suppose,
with a device like this

14:53.026 --> 14:55.726
There would be no
need for ratting.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.129
And it works well enough.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.534
She said your device works well!

15:03.670 --> 15:05.202
That's something.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.537
She didn't like it.

15:06.606 --> 15:07.939
Did she say that?

15:08.008 --> 15:10.207
No, but she doesn't understand

15:10.243 --> 15:12.076
Why I want to save the rat.

15:12.211 --> 15:15.546
In my opinion, rats are far
smarter

15:15.548 --> 15:18.416
And much nicer than people
give them credit for.

15:20.153 --> 15:23.821
Dr. Du bois?
Do you mind if I sit with you?

15:23.857 --> 15:25.756
Not at all.
No, please.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.694
How are you holding up?

15:29.829 --> 15:32.497
Eager to see which of us
the police pins this on.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.098
That's not going to happen.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.501
Maybe I should've kept this
meeting a bit more quiet.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.370
Absolutely not.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.174
My father was quite
inspired by your words

15:43.243 --> 15:45.510
And I share in
his admiration.

15:46.913 --> 15:50.181
What happened today,
don't let it discourage you.

15:50.316 --> 15:52.082
We must stand up
for ourselves.

15:52.518 --> 15:53.451
Hm.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.519
Your optimism is
quite refreshing.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.456
Is this your walking stick?

15:58.525 --> 15:59.423
Yes.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.459
Our friend has bruising
consistent

16:02.495 --> 16:04.061
With a rod-like object,

16:04.197 --> 16:07.097
Not unlike
this walking stick.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.534
And a witness said you
got into an argument

16:09.669 --> 16:10.668
With the victim
this morning.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.569
And you almost came to blows.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.471
It was merely
a small disagreement.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.741
You probably caught ethan
trying to ruin your conference

16:16.743 --> 16:18.142
And you killed him for it.

16:18.277 --> 16:19.810
You're under arrest.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.211
- Let's go.
- Please!

16:21.247 --> 16:22.413
Stop!
What are you doing?

16:22.449 --> 16:24.015
Step back!

16:25.251 --> 16:26.884
It's okay, harper.
Call my lawyer.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.886
- Do you know who that is?
- Back off!

16:28.955 --> 16:30.421
I won't tell you again.

16:37.563 --> 16:38.930
We need to do something!

16:39.065 --> 16:40.431
Calm down.
He couldn't have done it.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.765
He was on
the floor all day.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.834
We need to speak some
sense into those officers.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.704
Let him go!

16:46.839 --> 16:47.905
(du bois)
harper, go back inside.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.240
I warned you!

16:49.309 --> 16:50.708
Mr. Harper!

16:50.710 --> 16:52.843
(hart): Constable, sir, I'm
certain you have the wrong man.

16:52.879 --> 16:55.246
Dr. Du bois is innocent!

16:55.315 --> 16:57.715
I was holding his walking
stick during the event.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.783
Is that so?

17:05.658 --> 17:07.859
What's this?

17:09.462 --> 17:10.528
That's not mine.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.731
(constable):
Lowell.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.301
You're damn right
it's not yours.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.405
Nabbed it off the body after
you murdered him, didn't you?

17:21.408 --> 17:23.273
No, I didn't!

17:23.309 --> 17:24.809
I've never seen
that in my life.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.411
Ah, save it.
Take him in.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.845
Come on.
Let's go.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.080
- Come on!
- I didn't do this!

17:29.149 --> 17:30.915
(du bois):All right, harper.
We will fix this.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.549
Come on.
Now get in there!

17:32.585 --> 17:34.384
(harper): I'm telling you
I didn't do this!

17:35.688 --> 17:37.354
Dr. Du bois, are you all right?

17:37.390 --> 17:39.490
I'm fine, I'm fine.
But this-this can't be right.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.958
Mr. Harper would never
do anything like this.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.694
The police are certain
they've found their man.

17:46.032 --> 17:48.499
This murder will spell
the end of the naacp.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.913
Police are looking
at this case makes no sense.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.915
The cause of death was
strangulation, I'm sure of it.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.851
So, it doesn't matter
who had the walking stick.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.052
Exactly.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.854
If I could just get some
more time with the body,

18:09.923 --> 18:11.455
I can confirm it
once and for all.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.923
If mr. Harper killed him

18:12.992 --> 18:15.392
To stop him from ruining
dr. Du bois' speech,

18:15.428 --> 18:17.528
It makes no sense that
he would then rob him

18:17.530 --> 18:18.796
Of his pocket watch.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.798
They're looking for
the easiest person to blame.

18:21.835 --> 18:23.468
We have to prove them wrong.

18:25.004 --> 18:25.936
Look!

18:26.940 --> 18:28.139
(hart):
It's the symbol.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.674
(bright):
"purity. Loyalty. Strength.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.742
Join a brotherhood of patriots."

18:31.744 --> 18:34.412
Someone in here
must know the victim.

18:36.549 --> 18:37.682
This is not a good idea.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.685
Definitely not a good idea.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.224
Ooh! I think the judges are
about to post the results.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.829
You all right?
You look a bit nervous.

18:52.866 --> 18:55.499
Well, it's not every day
we get to participate

18:55.568 --> 18:57.301
In a science
competition.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.702
We?

18:58.738 --> 19:01.505
Hey, harry!
Have you seen my wonder clay?

19:02.909 --> 19:04.175
What does it do?

19:05.111 --> 19:07.511
You know,
you squish it.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.281
And you can put mica
on it to make it glitter.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.917
I guess we don't have
much to worry about.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.787
Here are the finalists.
Gather round.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.223
There I am!

19:19.358 --> 19:20.291
Me too!

19:20.426 --> 19:22.393
- Me three!
- Yes!

19:27.567 --> 19:29.666
(man): You were supposed
to go with him!

19:29.702 --> 19:30.868
Ethan told me to go home!

19:31.003 --> 19:32.669
He said that he didn't
want me there.

19:32.705 --> 19:33.871
You always hated him!

19:34.006 --> 19:35.873
You left him to be murdered
by those animals!

19:35.875 --> 19:37.341
What are you talking about?

19:37.476 --> 19:38.475
(both gasp)

19:43.783 --> 19:45.216
Are you all right?

19:46.886 --> 19:48.786
Were you talking about
ethan lowell just now?

19:49.822 --> 19:50.954
Did you know him?

19:53.459 --> 19:55.359
Who the hell are you?

19:55.494 --> 19:59.030
We are investigating
your friend's death.

20:01.100 --> 20:05.636
Before he died, he painted
that symbol on the wall.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.871
Was he a member of your group?

20:08.241 --> 20:09.906
It's not your business.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.042
(hart):
Cassie...

20:11.177 --> 20:12.443
Let's go.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.378
Sticking your nose where
it don't belong, are you?

20:14.447 --> 20:15.679
I assure you we're--

20:15.715 --> 20:18.149
You people just need
to learn your place!

20:18.284 --> 20:19.917
Let go!

20:20.052 --> 20:21.552
Stop!
Let her go! Stop.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.225
Don't let 'em get away!

20:29.762 --> 20:31.162
And you got away?

20:31.297 --> 20:34.532
Not before miss cassiopeia
bright nearly got us killed!

20:34.667 --> 20:36.266
How are we supposed
to get anything done

20:36.302 --> 20:37.868
If we're too scared
to move forward?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.870
You're too reckless,
miss bright.

20:39.872 --> 20:43.140
It did give you the opportunity
to save both our hides.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.142
It was quite magnificent.

20:45.178 --> 20:47.011
Flattery will get you nowhere.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.479
(bright):
Au contraire.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.181
This is not funny.
Do you know where you just were?

20:52.552 --> 20:54.318
This town is not like toronto.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.687
People like us have to
keep our head down.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.889
I assure you, toronto has
its fair share of prejudice.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.224
Not like here.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.361
I've seen many coloured
townsfolk beaten to the bone

21:03.363 --> 21:04.962
By men just like
the ones in that bar.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.032
That is awful.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.567
(buchanan): You have to
watch your step around here.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.103
I don't want you to get hurt.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.305
I appreciate you
looking out for us.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.706
We'll be more careful.

21:17.176 --> 21:20.044
We still aren't any closer to
proving mr. Harper's innocence.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.512
What do you have?

21:21.514 --> 21:24.115
The police have overlooked the
ligature marks on lowell's neck

21:24.117 --> 21:26.116
And maintain he was
beaten to death.

21:26.152 --> 21:27.517
Ah.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.853
Niagara police tend to
have a one-track mind.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.122
They latch onto a theory
and that's the end of it.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.325
If the cause of death is wrong,

21:34.460 --> 21:36.260
The entire case is wanting.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.128
(bright): Maybe you should
take another look at the body.

21:38.164 --> 21:40.364
That's impossible.
It's already in the morgue.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.600
Don't you have connections
with the police department?

21:43.636 --> 21:45.135
Will they be willing
to help us?

21:48.041 --> 21:51.008
Well, I didn't mean
connections in that respect.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.743
Hmm.
What did you mean?

21:53.713 --> 21:56.046
I work there...

21:58.017 --> 21:59.283
As the janitor.

21:59.418 --> 22:00.517
What?

22:01.821 --> 22:03.687
So, you lied to us.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.689
No, I help people
in the community,

22:05.725 --> 22:07.091
I just don't get
paid for it.

22:09.395 --> 22:10.961
I've always wanted to
be a constable,

22:11.030 --> 22:13.630
But the colour
of my skin prevents me.

22:13.632 --> 22:16.032
So you made us believe you
were something you were not.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.836
I'm sorry.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.643
I may know someone
who could help.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.718
Hey, there, little guy.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.654
It works.
Bravo!

22:36.789 --> 22:38.255
Of course it works.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.858
Have you given any thought to
what you'll do with it, harry?

22:40.860 --> 22:43.260
You should leave it in there
for the judges to see.

22:43.296 --> 22:45.062
Perhaps he should
keep it as a pet?

22:45.565 --> 22:46.930
Can I?

22:46.966 --> 22:48.399
No.

22:48.401 --> 22:51.201
Harry! What have you
done with my project?

22:51.270 --> 22:52.937
I didn't do anything to it.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.272
It's missing!
You hid it to win our wager!

22:55.341 --> 22:56.740
You're a cheater!
A thief!

22:56.776 --> 22:58.542
Just a moment, young lady.

22:58.544 --> 22:59.877
Let's not jump to conclusions.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.278
Harry is not a thief.

23:01.347 --> 23:03.247
I went to the water closet
for five minutes

23:03.316 --> 23:04.315
And now it's gone.

23:04.317 --> 23:05.750
Harry's booth is closest to mine

23:05.885 --> 23:08.619
And he is the only one who
would want to sabotage me!

23:08.754 --> 23:12.222
Harry, did you notice anyone
come by when florence was gone?

23:12.291 --> 23:13.457
Did you see anything?

23:13.592 --> 23:15.359
Are you suggesting
harry did this?

23:15.361 --> 23:17.928
No, I'm just
asking a question.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.298
I didn't see anything.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.434
Where did you last see it?

23:23.436 --> 23:26.504
It was packed in my wooden crate
and wrapped with a tarp.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.438
I was only gone
for a few minutes.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.611
The tarp!

23:36.048 --> 23:36.980
Ah.

23:38.384 --> 23:40.117
Oh!

23:40.119 --> 23:41.318
There we are.

23:41.387 --> 23:43.587
So, someone could
have left with it.

23:43.722 --> 23:45.856
No, no one's been let in yet.

23:45.991 --> 23:47.991
If it was stolen by another
contestant

23:48.060 --> 23:49.927
And stashed
beneath his booth,

23:49.996 --> 23:51.862
It should be
easy to spot.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.697
All right, then.
We'll have a look.

23:55.301 --> 23:56.867
Don't you worry, florence,

23:56.936 --> 23:59.603
You have toronto's best
detective on the case.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.673
Isn't harry a little too young
to be considered toronto's best?

24:04.677 --> 24:06.009
Let's search.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.212
(hart):
Sorry to disturb you, inspector,

24:08.281 --> 24:10.281
But we've run into
some trouble down here in town.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.348
What's happened?

24:11.417 --> 24:13.216
Our event has been targeted.

24:13.252 --> 24:16.220
A member from our group was
wrongfully arrested for murder.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.088
Blimey!
I've only been away for a day.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.090
It has been an ordeal.

24:20.159 --> 24:23.360
I would not call if there was
anything else we could do.

24:23.362 --> 24:25.829
- (margaret): Thomas?
- Not to worry, mrs. Hart.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.431
You're actually
doing me a favour

24:27.433 --> 24:28.832
By getting me
out of here.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.434
I'll see you first thing
in the morning.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.769
Thank you, inspector.

24:32.839 --> 24:35.772
Oh, and, uh, stay out
of trouble until then.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.073
Yes, of course.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.509
Goodnight.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.177
(margaret):
Just the three of us.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.045
We'll have such a lovely
time tonight.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.181
(sighs)

24:45.051 --> 24:46.616
He'll be here in the morning.

24:46.652 --> 24:50.053
But I would still like to take
a look at that body before then.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.188
Then we shall do just that.

24:52.225 --> 24:55.058
No, they're not just going to
let you two into the morgue.

24:55.761 --> 24:57.361
You are the janitor.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.129
You have the keys, do you not?

24:59.198 --> 25:01.698
No.
Absolutely not.

25:08.474 --> 25:10.140
Please be quick about it.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.474
We'll be out before you know it.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.415
Just as I thought.

25:18.551 --> 25:20.551
The marks are much darker now.
There's a pattern here.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.953
(bright):
What does that mean?

25:23.088 --> 25:25.956
The bruising will match whatever
was used to strangle him.

25:26.091 --> 25:27.691
What about the walking stick?

25:29.095 --> 25:31.362
These bruises could have been
caused by any stick or club.

25:32.498 --> 25:34.098
Presently I see
bruising on the arms...

25:35.234 --> 25:38.702
And this contusion,
which is superficial.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.137
It would not have been fatal.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.673
The cause of death
is strangulation.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.142
Miss bright, help me with this.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.578
You want me to touch him?

25:48.614 --> 25:50.915
Turn his head gently.
And quickly!

26:07.132 --> 26:08.865
We need to get these
photos developed.

26:08.935 --> 26:12.002
We can ask isaiah
if there's a place in town.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.604
Did you find anything
in the police report?

26:13.739 --> 26:17.207
There isn't anything about
strangulation in here.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.943
No mention of
the ligature marks.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.511
They're disregarding them?

26:22.414 --> 26:23.614
(bright):
There's this.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.281
(hart):
I can't believe it.

26:25.318 --> 26:27.418
They're releasing the body
tomorrow for cremation

26:27.420 --> 26:29.152
Without doing
a full postmortem.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.754
This doesn't seem right to me.

26:30.889 --> 26:33.090
We don't know who
the murderer is.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.425
It says here that
mr. Harper confessed!

26:38.297 --> 26:39.963
Is this the obituary you
found in the...

26:39.999 --> 26:41.698
(door opening)

26:43.135 --> 26:45.135
Hide!
Quickly.

26:47.340 --> 26:48.938
Come on, cassie.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.541
Sir?

27:24.577 --> 27:25.942
Constable jope?

27:25.978 --> 27:28.078
What are you doing in here
this time of night?

27:28.147 --> 27:30.013
I forgot to pick up
ethan's personal belongings

27:30.049 --> 27:32.082
For the release tomorrow.

27:32.217 --> 27:33.416
Who's picking him up?

27:33.452 --> 27:34.951
Huh. His brother.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.422
No love lost between
those two, eh?

27:38.424 --> 27:39.556
No.

27:51.570 --> 27:52.636
Look!

27:53.472 --> 27:55.105
(murdoch):
What do you see?

27:55.174 --> 27:56.840
(harry):
The box at owen's booth.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.909
There's something inside.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.445
It's him!
He's the thief.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.046
(murdoch):
Now, now.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.915
One piece of
circumstantial evidence

28:04.917 --> 28:06.583
Isn't enough to
condemn a man.

28:06.652 --> 28:08.185
I have more than that.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.786
Well, let's hear it.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.722
Substantiate your claims.

28:11.724 --> 28:15.659
He was very interested in
florence's device yesterday

28:15.728 --> 28:19.463
And was upset that she wouldn't
let him take a turn flying it.

28:19.532 --> 28:21.732
You believe he stole it
because he was jealous.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.268
That could be motive,

28:24.270 --> 28:26.069
But that's hardly enough
to build a case, harry.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.737
It's him.
I know it!

28:32.712 --> 28:34.712
Hey!
What are you doing?

28:35.814 --> 28:38.148
- That's my mica glitter!
- Sorry, owen.

28:38.283 --> 28:39.883
I was just, uh...

28:40.018 --> 28:41.885
Looking for something.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.020
Sorry.

28:45.491 --> 28:49.159
You see: Motive by itself
is hardly ever enough.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.261
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:54.767 --> 28:57.234
Why would mr. Harper confess
to a crime of murder?

28:57.369 --> 28:58.769
Perhaps he is guilty.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.304
The inspector said the lowell
brothers don't get along.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.640
That would be daniel lowell,
another town troublemaker.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.442
We have to question him.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.178
Ladies.
The cavalry has arrived.

29:08.214 --> 29:09.580
Where's the fire?

29:09.582 --> 29:11.381
Inspector, you've arrived
at the perfect time.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.483
This is your inspector
from toronto, mrs. Hart?

29:13.552 --> 29:14.584
(brackenreid):
That's right.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.954
Inspector brackenreid,
this is isaiah buchanan,

29:16.956 --> 29:19.389
Niagara's finest
janitorial inspector.

29:19.425 --> 29:20.924
Pleased to meet you, isaiah.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.326
So, ladies, fill me in
on to what's been happening

29:23.362 --> 29:25.328
And I'll let the dog
see the rabbit.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.597
Sir, the police are holding
a man from our group

29:27.633 --> 29:29.199
For a murder
he did not commit.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.067
But we have
substantial evidence

29:31.103 --> 29:33.269
That contradicts
the police's theory.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.538
What have you found out?

29:34.607 --> 29:36.673
The police say the victim
was beaten to death,

29:36.709 --> 29:38.775
But take a look
at these.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.679
Where did you lot get
these photos from?

29:44.116 --> 29:46.717
No, on second thought, I don't
want to know the answer to that.

29:46.719 --> 29:49.152
(hart): The body is due
to be cremated today,

29:49.155 --> 29:51.020
So the window to prove
mr. Harper's innocence

29:51.056 --> 29:52.756
Is closing.

29:52.891 --> 29:54.424
(brackenreid):
What's that?

29:54.426 --> 29:56.093
The victim painted this symbol.

29:56.228 --> 29:58.361
We found the same symbol
at the local bar.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.363
I've seen this kind
of thing before.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.765
All this rubbish about
bloodlines and purity.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.434
These are dangerous people.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.402
(hart):
Well, right now we need to focus

30:06.438 --> 30:08.138
On getting mr. Harper
out of prison.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.939
Right, you lot stay here.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.174
I'll go to the constabulary.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.810
See if I can get to
the bottom of this.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.044
All right.

30:14.113 --> 30:16.313
I need to get to work.
Be careful.

30:16.382 --> 30:17.780
We will.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.717
We need to find daniel lowell.

30:20.719 --> 30:22.953
If we search his home,
we may be able to find a weapon

30:23.088 --> 30:24.054
That matches the bruising.

30:24.189 --> 30:26.723
Here's the address.
Interesting.

30:26.725 --> 30:29.192
The brothers lived together.

30:34.033 --> 30:36.199
(brackenreid): I heard you got
a man for your murder yesterday.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.735
I came down here to check
out your suspect.

30:38.804 --> 30:41.404
We had a similar incident
in toronto recently.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.306
You did, did you?

30:43.375 --> 30:44.741
Yeah.

30:44.743 --> 30:47.410
A negro man killed a good white
man for no reason at all.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.713
Oh, you can't find reason
with those sorts.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.617
Do you mind if I ask him a
couple questions about my case?

30:53.686 --> 30:56.419
- Have at it.
- Thank you, chief.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.828
It isn't with any
of the participants.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.163
What will I do?

31:07.199 --> 31:10.634
Well, there is one place
we haven't looked.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.112
Hmm.
It's locked.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.313
Hmm.

31:26.852 --> 31:28.351
Oh! No, it's not.

31:33.659 --> 31:34.757
You see anything?

31:35.995 --> 31:37.260
(harry):
Oh, here!

31:39.398 --> 31:40.863
(gasps)

31:40.900 --> 31:42.298
Thank you.

31:45.537 --> 31:46.803
Thank you.

31:48.674 --> 31:49.872
Good job, father.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.741
Good job, harry.

31:51.810 --> 31:53.276
But we still have work to do.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.812
You built a mousetrap

31:55.848 --> 31:58.415
And we need
to catch a thief.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.417
Should we interrogate suspects?

32:02.254 --> 32:04.654
What if we built a mantrap?

32:13.799 --> 32:14.965
Bloody hell.

32:24.309 --> 32:25.442
I'm here to help.

32:26.412 --> 32:27.610
I doubt that.

32:28.814 --> 32:30.613
Did you kill mr. Lowell?

32:32.785 --> 32:34.851
I didn't even know him.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.319
(brackenreid):
Not what I asked.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.790
Yeah, I killed him.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.260
Is that what you want to hear?

32:44.262 --> 32:45.528
I want to hear the truth.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.364
No, you don't.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.201
Let's say I killed him.

32:51.336 --> 32:53.669
Let this charade be over.

32:53.706 --> 32:56.139
I'm not interested in a charade.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.675
I'm interested in just...

32:58.744 --> 33:00.744
I'm interested in justice.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.115
Well, you sure as hell
ain't gonna find it here.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.971
That's the man from the bar.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.305
Let's go.

33:29.307 --> 33:30.573
What if he comes back?

33:30.642 --> 33:32.242
I thought you wanted
to solve this.

33:32.978 --> 33:34.310
The door is locked.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.845
This is a bad idea.

33:35.881 --> 33:37.080
Hairpin.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.326
Where did you learn to do that?

33:49.461 --> 33:50.726
In a past life.

33:50.763 --> 33:51.961
Let's go.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.736
This is illegal. They can't just
bar us from seeing mr. Harper!

33:59.871 --> 34:01.071
Maybe if you had asked nicely

34:01.206 --> 34:03.273
Instead of charging in
there like a mad man.

34:03.408 --> 34:04.407
You'll never change.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.275
Your pacifism only serves to
prop up the system

34:06.311 --> 34:07.611
That is
oppressing us!

34:07.746 --> 34:10.613
Your agitation results
in negroes getting hurt,

34:10.649 --> 34:11.948
Which is worse!

34:11.950 --> 34:13.349
Excuse me, gentlemen,

34:13.385 --> 34:15.184
What can you tell me
about a mr. Harper?

34:16.055 --> 34:17.120
Who are you?

34:17.256 --> 34:18.555
Someone who wants to help.

34:18.690 --> 34:19.956
You the police?

34:19.958 --> 34:20.824
I am.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.358
Then we don't need your help.

34:22.394 --> 34:23.894
Don't listen to him.
What can you tell us?

34:24.029 --> 34:24.827
Listen, don't bother with him.

34:24.863 --> 34:26.896
Du bois, he is offering to help.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.197
We don't need his help!

34:29.367 --> 34:31.234
- All you cops are the same.
- That's not true.

34:32.270 --> 34:33.570
We took an oath
to serve justice.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.037
We don't take that lightly.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.174
Well, with all
due respect, sir,

34:37.176 --> 34:39.109
There is no justice here.

34:39.111 --> 34:42.345
Police will always protect
the police, no matter what.

34:51.056 --> 34:52.421
Isaiah, come here.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.259
We need to get your friend out
of there as quickly as possible.

34:56.394 --> 34:57.860
They've beaten
a confession out of him.

34:57.896 --> 34:58.929
He's not in a good way.

34:59.064 --> 35:00.930
Well, if that's the case,

35:00.999 --> 35:02.465
It proves that
they're framing him.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.133
(brackenreid): We'll need
a little bit more than that.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.870
Look, we need to
tread carefully.

35:07.005 --> 35:09.338
Not everyone around here
is necessarily on our side.

35:09.374 --> 35:10.773
That is wretched.

35:10.809 --> 35:13.543
According to the police, mr.
Lowell was beat to death

35:13.545 --> 35:15.679
With a cane
by mr. Harper.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.881
Mrs. Hart does not believe
that to be the case.

35:17.883 --> 35:20.082
(brackenreid): Well, we need
something to support that.

35:20.119 --> 35:22.185
Well, how do I do that?
The body's gone.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.222
You work in there.
Find something.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.157
Use your imagination.

35:47.212 --> 35:48.578
(o'malley): What do you think
you're doing in here?

35:50.348 --> 35:51.948
Nothing, sir.

35:56.855 --> 35:59.522
What are you doing snooping
around my office, boy?

35:59.525 --> 36:01.591
Well, I'm just, uh...
I'm just doing my job, sir.

36:01.726 --> 36:03.926
Weren't you one of the mokes
down at the crime scene?

36:03.962 --> 36:06.196
Sir, that's isaiah,
the cleaning man.

36:06.198 --> 36:07.464
Been working here
for months now.

36:07.599 --> 36:08.598
Is that so?

36:08.733 --> 36:10.734
Never seen him before.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.668
That's the mark of
a good janitor.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.404
I don't like the look of him.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.273
Trust me, he's one
of the good ones.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.373
I like him.

36:18.677 --> 36:19.809
(o'malley):
Fine.

36:21.413 --> 36:22.612
Get out of my sight.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.548
Yes, sir.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.382
Stop.

36:29.054 --> 36:31.120
Aren't you forgetting something?

36:36.561 --> 36:38.327
That one, too.

36:38.363 --> 36:39.563
Right.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.102
(police laugh)

37:01.186 --> 37:02.852
There's nothing here.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.120
We've got to keep looking.

37:07.192 --> 37:08.391
Look at this.

37:08.526 --> 37:10.327
What is it?

37:10.329 --> 37:12.662
It's the newspaper lowell
ripped the obituary from.

37:13.798 --> 37:15.731
The welland daily.
It's a small town nearby.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.133
Why would he do that?

37:18.070 --> 37:19.268
And that?

37:20.205 --> 37:21.470
Census report.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.709
Take a look at the name!

37:30.115 --> 37:31.414
Good lord.

37:33.252 --> 37:37.720
(electronic beeping)

37:37.789 --> 37:39.556
My invention's gone!

37:39.558 --> 37:41.223
But there's nobody in there.

37:42.494 --> 37:45.028
Well, I guess it could trap
a mouse, but not a person.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.230
(murdoch):
Oh! Don't be so sure about that.

37:47.365 --> 37:49.232
Judge perrywinkle, a word?

37:49.301 --> 37:51.100
About what?

37:51.136 --> 37:53.102
About stealing
a child's invention.

37:56.041 --> 37:58.307
I did no such thing.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.245
Then why are you
covered in glitter?

38:03.348 --> 38:05.214
What glitter?

38:05.250 --> 38:07.984
The mica we borrowed from the
boy who made the wonder clay.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.585
That mica was triggered

38:09.621 --> 38:11.521
When the door to
the closet was opened.

38:12.758 --> 38:15.524
(ogden): How could you rob
a child of her invention?

38:16.628 --> 38:19.595
I simply opened a door.

38:19.631 --> 38:23.032
Madam, I'm prepared to
prosecute this fully.

38:23.101 --> 38:25.334
Or you can return
the young lady's invention,

38:25.370 --> 38:26.502
Your decision.

38:29.741 --> 38:34.210
This child has no idea
what she has here.

38:34.246 --> 38:37.013
Just give it back!
It's just a flying toy.

38:37.015 --> 38:37.881
Hey!

38:38.016 --> 38:39.949
Sorry.

38:40.085 --> 38:43.753
It could be so much
more than that!

38:43.888 --> 38:47.256
I have never seen
such engineering.

38:47.326 --> 38:50.326
I was going to patent
the mechanics

38:50.329 --> 38:52.829
To make larger
flying machines.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.964
I could have been
a revolutionary!

38:55.100 --> 38:57.199
(ogden): You should be
ashamed of yourself!

38:58.370 --> 39:00.436
Miss perrywinkle,
you're under arrest.

39:02.174 --> 39:04.874
Harry, your device caught her.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.243
It did!

39:07.912 --> 39:08.778
Thank you.

39:12.351 --> 39:14.650
I suppose he won't
mind spending money

39:14.686 --> 39:16.319
On that banana split,
after all.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.459
(o'malley):
What are you doing with those?

39:22.461 --> 39:24.260
These were used to
murder mr. Lowell.

39:26.664 --> 39:28.264
This is ludicrous.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.533
No, I'll tell you
what is ludicrous,

39:30.535 --> 39:33.068
A copper joining
an organization like that.

39:33.105 --> 39:35.671
(o'malley): We are a community
of likeminded individuals.

39:36.941 --> 39:38.808
(brackenreid): Mr. Lowell
was a member, was he not?

39:38.943 --> 39:40.076
What was it, o'malley?

39:40.078 --> 39:41.577
Was it a power struggle?

39:41.579 --> 39:43.613
Get out of here.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.682
Why don't I just get a
confession out of you

39:45.684 --> 39:46.816
Like you did mr. Harper?

39:46.951 --> 39:49.352
I was across town
investigating a robbery

39:49.421 --> 39:51.287
When lowell was killed.

39:51.356 --> 39:53.756
Then you ordered one of your
own to do your dirty work.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.592
You have nothing.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.596
What are you two doing here?

39:59.598 --> 40:00.763
Saving your bacon.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.832
What are you talking
about, miss hart?

40:02.868 --> 40:04.367
Take a look at this.

40:05.536 --> 40:07.036
It's a census report
mr. Lowell requested

40:07.172 --> 40:08.571
Before he was murdered.

40:08.706 --> 40:10.106
It's for genevieve walker,

40:10.108 --> 40:13.242
The coloured woman in the
obituary lowell was carrying.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.646
When the census was taken,
she had a different surname.

40:16.715 --> 40:19.215
Her surname from her
first marriage was jope.

40:21.453 --> 40:23.153
You're coloured, aren't you?

40:23.288 --> 40:24.587
You're crazy.

40:24.656 --> 40:25.821
I don't think so.

40:26.892 --> 40:29.459
I think mrs. Walker
was your grandmother.

40:29.461 --> 40:30.560
What?

40:30.695 --> 40:32.728
That's why you were
at the morgue last night,

40:32.764 --> 40:34.396
To steal back
the obituary.

40:34.433 --> 40:36.398
It was proof
of your identity.

40:36.435 --> 40:38.668
This is insane.
Do I look coloured?

40:38.670 --> 40:39.869
If this is
your grandmother,

40:39.938 --> 40:42.205
Then there's no
denying what you are.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.340
It's in your blood, boy.

40:44.409 --> 40:46.943
(brackenreid): So, you killed
to stop this getting out.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.344
I-I'm not...

40:48.346 --> 40:51.413
I-I didn't-- y-you all have
no proof of anything.

40:51.450 --> 40:53.816
If I were to lift the
fingermarks from these nippers,

40:53.885 --> 40:55.485
I wouldn't find yours on there?

40:55.620 --> 40:56.953
It was you.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.821
You and ethan
have had tension.

40:58.857 --> 41:01.724
You almost came to blows
at the last brotherhood meeting!

41:01.860 --> 41:03.927
- Ain't that true?
- (hart): He found out.

41:03.929 --> 41:06.095
And was going to
reveal your secret.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.697
(brackenreid):
You'd have lost everything.

41:07.766 --> 41:10.933
Your job, your friends
and your life as you know it.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.770
He said I was coloured.
He was going to destroy me.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.104
So you got there first.

41:16.475 --> 41:18.641
I'm not, I'm not coloured.

41:19.444 --> 41:21.044
I don't want to be coloured.

41:21.179 --> 41:23.913
I don't care who,
or what, you are.

41:24.048 --> 41:26.449
Coloured or white,
you killed a man.

41:26.584 --> 41:28.985
And that is the only thing
you need be ashamed of.

41:42.400 --> 41:46.269
Look at us, at all of this.

41:46.404 --> 41:49.572
Being who we are should be
something to be celebrated.

41:50.808 --> 41:52.875
Perhaps jope thought
the only way to get along

41:52.878 --> 41:54.076
Was to go
along.

41:54.112 --> 41:55.711
And live a lie.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.147
We all do, don't we?

41:58.183 --> 41:59.482
What's that?

41:59.551 --> 42:01.284
(hart):
Live a lie.

42:01.419 --> 42:03.620
Present one side of ourselves
for the world to see.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.721
I don't.

42:06.424 --> 42:07.556
I don't believe that.

42:08.626 --> 42:09.759
Excuse me.

42:13.732 --> 42:17.099
I heard what you did today,
sneaking into o'malley's office.

42:18.403 --> 42:19.735
Just trying to do my part.

42:20.705 --> 42:22.371
A part that,
while very brave,

42:22.440 --> 42:23.840
Was also very stupid.

42:24.976 --> 42:28.110
Well, perhaps I was trying
to impress you.

42:28.179 --> 42:29.312
Is that so?

42:30.415 --> 42:31.848
Next time be more
clever about it.

42:32.584 --> 42:33.916
Hm.

42:37.956 --> 42:40.990
He's only ten years old,
so please try to keep an eye

42:41.059 --> 42:42.658
On him for the entire journey.

42:42.694 --> 42:45.695
He's going to windsor
station, in montreal.

42:45.830 --> 42:48.331
Please be sure not to
let him miss his stop.

42:48.333 --> 42:50.133
He's meeting
a miss freddie pink there.

42:50.268 --> 42:53.603
I've made his lunch, so, if
you could make sure he got it?

42:53.738 --> 42:54.470
I'll be fine.

42:54.539 --> 42:55.505
Promise.

42:59.444 --> 43:02.311
Thank you for the banana split.

43:03.615 --> 43:06.048
(harry): She has entered
the montreal competition.

43:07.052 --> 43:08.885
And I'll be happy to
lose to her again.

43:09.821 --> 43:11.053
Could I sit with you?

43:13.892 --> 43:15.491
Harry...

43:15.560 --> 43:17.427
(florence): Here, I'd like to
show you what I have for...

43:17.562 --> 43:20.763
Harry, be sure to write
when you arrive in montreal.

43:21.733 --> 43:22.798
I will.

43:23.301 --> 43:24.299
Bye, harry.

43:27.706 --> 43:29.304
Sure he'll be all right?

43:29.341 --> 43:30.773
Oh, I should think not.

43:30.842 --> 43:33.042
He seems to have fallen
for a clever woman.

43:33.177 --> 43:35.044
He's in for
a lifetime of trouble.
