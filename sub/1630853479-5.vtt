00:01.793 --> 00:03.878
I'm Tom Swift.
Inventor, billionaire,

00:03.920 --> 00:06.006
shoe collector extraordinaire.

00:06.047 --> 00:08.299
But none of that was good enough
for my dad.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.260
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn,

00:10.301 --> 00:13.221
I could earn his love, but
his mission ended tragically.

00:13.263 --> 00:17.225
Or so I thought.
Turns out, it was sabotage.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.060
My father survived the attack,

00:19.102 --> 00:20.812
and sent me a message capsule

00:20.854 --> 00:22.814
with the data I need
to rescue him from space.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.734
But it exploded
when it entered the atmosphere.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.569
Now I have to find

00:27.610 --> 00:30.488
the pieces of that capsule
and reassemble my dad's message.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.825
A global conspiracy called The
Road Back is standing in my way.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.494
So I can only trust my squad--
my best friend, Zenzi,

00:36.536 --> 00:38.455
my bodyguard, Isaac,

00:38.496 --> 00:41.708
my adopted brother, Lino,
and my AI, Barclay.

00:41.750 --> 00:45.170
Together we're going to find
my father and bring him home.

00:47.338 --> 00:49.632
TOM:
Let's review.

00:49.674 --> 00:52.177
Capsule piece retrieval mission
number three.

00:52.218 --> 00:55.638
This time,
no detours, kidnappings,

00:55.680 --> 00:57.766
or rogue dates...

00:57.807 --> 01:00.226
so we can rescue my dad
before The Road Back discovers

01:00.268 --> 01:01.519
he's still alive.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.271
He sent me
a message capsule.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.315
And the capsule exploded
in the atmosphere.

01:05.355 --> 01:06.900
And once
we reassemble it...

01:06.941 --> 01:09.110
We can decipher the message
and rescue Barton.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.737
We've got this, boss.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.655
Scheduled touchdown: 1500.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.908
BARCLAY: In Utah's
Snow Canyon State Park.
(groans)

01:14.949 --> 01:16.158
Look at us.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.786
We are getting the hang of this.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.746
Duh.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.748
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Incoming call from Usurper.
(phone ringing)

01:21.789 --> 01:23.333
Hello, Tom.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.752
Your access to the Swift Jet
has been revoked.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.795
(scoffs)
You can't ground me.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.464
You don't have any authority.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.508
No, but Lorraine Swift does.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.468
What?

01:33.509 --> 01:35.470
LORRAINE:
Why did business affairs

01:35.512 --> 01:38.306
notify me you approved
a Swift spa resort

01:38.348 --> 01:40.140
in Langstonville, Oklahoma?

01:40.183 --> 01:41.893
Oh.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.479
(chuckles)
It's actually a funny story...

01:44.521 --> 01:46.146
Our investors disagree.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.982
Since the Saturn disaster,
our stock

01:48.024 --> 01:49.984
has plummeted.
Now I'm fielding calls

01:50.026 --> 01:52.362
asking if we're sinking millions
into travel wellness.

01:52.402 --> 01:54.572
LORRAINE: Mm.
What am I supposed to say, Tom?

01:54.614 --> 01:56.199
That Oklahoma is the new Tulum?

01:57.325 --> 01:59.953
Look, it might take
a few years...

01:59.994 --> 02:02.872
"Years"?
The company is struggling now.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.124
You're a mess.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.751
You need a wake-up call.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.169
And maybe losing

02:08.211 --> 02:11.214
your title and resources
will achieve that.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.092
I'm suspending you from your
position at Swift Enterprises.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.011
What?! I am working
on something right now.

02:17.053 --> 02:19.097
I need access to the--

02:22.183 --> 02:23.643
It's for the best.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.353
Not everyone has
a mind for business.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.732
Then let me learn.

02:29.774 --> 02:32.026
Not my old job.

02:32.067 --> 02:33.945
Entry level.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.739
Let me work my way up
and earn my old job back.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.449
Hmm?

02:40.869 --> 02:43.204
If you're serious...

02:43.246 --> 02:44.956
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.291
7:00 a.m.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.127
Sharp.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.966
♪ ♪

03:07.103 --> 03:09.189
(phone chimes)

03:09.981 --> 03:11.566
LINO:
Going to see Bio-Mom.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.484
Don't be mad.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.903
ISAAC:
How do you know where she is?

03:14.944 --> 03:16.279
Wait for me.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.869
JONES:
We need to finalize the Tubman
Group Cotillion plans.

03:22.911 --> 03:26.039
Pastor, it has been difficult.

03:26.079 --> 03:27.957
Barton loved
the cotillion.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.709
Yes.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.879
This will be the first year
in 25 he isn't by my side.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.256
The thought of being
at this celebration,

03:35.298 --> 03:36.925
and then looking over
at his empty chair...

03:36.966 --> 03:38.635
JONES:
Mm.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.678
I can attend cotillion with you.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.805
So you can abandon me
halfway through?

03:45.600 --> 03:46.893
(exhales)

03:46.935 --> 03:49.020
Why don't I leave you to talk?

03:54.817 --> 03:57.487
These past few weeks
have been the hardest

03:57.528 --> 03:59.697
our family has ever faced.

03:59.739 --> 04:03.493
And every time I've needed you,
you disappear.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.578
I don't know, maybe I did
something wrong raising you.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.247
No.

04:07.288 --> 04:10.250
I am so sorry.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.127
I know that I've been
distracted lately.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.171
But I'll be there.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.048
I promise.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.926
By your side,

04:19.968 --> 04:21.719
all night.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.805
I hope so.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.776
We said we'd talk
with Lorraine first.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.695
How did you
even find her?

04:38.736 --> 04:40.238
You said Newburgh.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.490
I googled
"Newburgh treatment facility."

04:43.741 --> 04:46.494
I keep seeing weird things,

04:46.536 --> 04:49.372
like my senses are bending.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.001
Aunt Lorraine said
my mom used to see things.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.169
Maybe she can help.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.755
Well, you've got the Swift
flair for the dramatic.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.882
Actually, it's a
distinctly Warren trait.

04:59.924 --> 05:02.385
Barton wouldn't know
flair if you fired it

05:02.427 --> 05:04.304
up his ass.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.683
Lino?

05:08.725 --> 05:11.311
(inhales)
Oh, my Lino.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.438
(laughs) Oh!

05:15.231 --> 05:18.026
You have such
an appetite.

05:18.067 --> 05:21.404
There's a great Ethiopian
restaurant nearby.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.990
You can leave here?

05:24.032 --> 05:26.075
I'm not a prisoner.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.202
I-I just keep a room here

05:28.244 --> 05:30.204
for when...

05:30.246 --> 05:32.206
I need... rest.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.917
How come you never
came to see me?

05:34.959 --> 05:37.837
I never stopped wanting to.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.298
But Lorraine, my sister,

05:40.340 --> 05:42.300
she craves control.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.969
And when I wouldn't submit,
she hit me with

05:45.011 --> 05:46.846
a restraining order.
"A restraining order"?

05:46.888 --> 05:49.849
One turbulent episode years ago,
she lost it,

05:49.891 --> 05:51.976
using my setbacks against me.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.604
Can I be here? I-I don't want
to get you in trouble.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.731
You approached me.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.192
(chuckles)
So it's fine.

05:59.233 --> 06:02.236
And your cotillion

06:02.278 --> 06:05.406
means you're nearly... grown.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.494
So Lorraine should let you
make your own decisions.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.996
ISAAC: Lino,
isn't there

06:12.038 --> 06:13.873
something you wanted to ask?

06:13.915 --> 06:16.417
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.212
(chuckles)
This is gonna sound weird.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.756
But when I get stressed,

06:21.798 --> 06:24.133
it's like I feel
energy around me.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.303
Electricity crackling
through things.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.639
Has that ever
happened to you?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.391
It hasn't.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.268
But it sounds...

06:34.310 --> 06:36.437
beautiful.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.399
There's nothing
wrong with you.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.275
You and I, we just...

06:41.317 --> 06:43.611
we just deal
with stress differently.

06:43.653 --> 06:47.156
When I get overwhelmed when
I'm around too many people,

06:47.198 --> 06:50.784
or in an unfamiliar place,
I, um...

06:50.827 --> 06:53.955
I calm myself by picturing

06:53.996 --> 06:56.624
a setting that-that's peaceful.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.751
Like...

06:58.793 --> 07:00.628
this garden.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.297
Can I, can I show you
a breathing exercise?

07:04.507 --> 07:08.177
You trace your finger up

07:08.219 --> 07:10.096
as you breathe in,
and then...

07:10.138 --> 07:11.848
down the other side
as you breathe out.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.100
In... out.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.562
You don't get stressed?

07:28.531 --> 07:30.867
Come see me again.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.327
We need to loop in Lorraine.

07:33.369 --> 07:36.038
I would love...

07:36.080 --> 07:39.125
to be part of your life, Lino.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.669
(both chuckle softly)

07:41.711 --> 07:43.671
TOM:
Hello.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.631
It's my first day
in the bullpen. I'm...

07:45.673 --> 07:47.467
Tom Swift. I know.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.968
Everyone knows.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.095
I'm Quinn,
Claire's assistant.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.099
We've met
multiple times.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.393
Okay.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.978
Your first assignment:

07:59.020 --> 08:01.272
copy-edit blurbs
for your latest products

08:01.314 --> 08:03.357
so I can import them
into Canva

08:03.399 --> 08:06.027
for Claire's
investor presentation.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.695
TOM:
Cool.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.322
But...

08:09.363 --> 08:11.741
I'm a world-changing inventor.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.493
This...

08:13.534 --> 08:14.952
just feels
like a waste of my talents.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.580
Yeah, that's
kind of what working is.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.373
Zenzi, hey!
(laughs)

08:19.415 --> 08:20.875
Girl.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.002
What?
Um, we were
looking for somebody

08:23.044 --> 08:25.379
who enjoyed copy-editing and...
Okay, well...

08:25.421 --> 08:27.048
I thought of you.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.799
ZENZI: You know I never
thought I'd see the day that

08:28.841 --> 08:32.053
Tom Swift would have
to fix comma splices.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.721
TOM:
Comma...

08:33.763 --> 08:36.057
spli-splices.
I know what those are.

08:36.097 --> 08:38.392
See, this is what happens
when you let Barclay complete

08:38.433 --> 08:40.394
your MIT writing requirement.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.230
(scoffs)

08:42.270 --> 08:44.106
(stammers) Just...
it'll be faster

08:44.148 --> 08:45.399
if I start it off for you.
Okay.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.109
QUINN:
Ah, ah, ah, careful.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.569
Claire didn't
want you just

08:48.611 --> 08:50.404
falling back on Zenzi.

08:50.446 --> 08:51.572
How is Claire gonna know...?
CLAIRE: Zenzi!

08:51.614 --> 08:53.074
Ooh!
Mm-mm!

08:53.115 --> 08:54.534
A word?

08:56.327 --> 09:00.122
Tom's suspension has created
a power vacuum.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.752
I'm in the market
for someone to mentor.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.921
You and I can lead

09:06.963 --> 09:08.881
SE into a new era.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.342
I'm offering you
a big step up.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.719
Yeah, I can't stab Tom
in the back.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.388
He's been in the bullpen
for five minutes,

09:15.429 --> 09:16.889
and already asking you to do

09:16.931 --> 09:19.100
his work.
(scoffs)

09:19.141 --> 09:22.019
You can't shine if you're always
cleaning up after someone else.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.523
My offer expires in 24 hours.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.943
You can go.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.364
(door opens)

09:33.406 --> 09:35.032
Okay.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.826
There's something
in the mailroom.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.287
Unless it's Rome Flynn gift
wrapped, why are you telling me?

09:39.328 --> 09:41.622
You asked for all
of Tom's mail to be monitored.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.458
X-ray flagged a strange package
with a message written on it.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.128
"Urgent. Tom, I believe
this belongs to you."

09:47.169 --> 09:49.338
No return address.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.716
Bring it to me.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.510
BARCLAY: Capsule piece
scanners have found

09:54.552 --> 09:56.512
a signature inside the building.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.639
Inside the building?

10:03.769 --> 10:06.897
Hacking into Swift security...

10:27.501 --> 10:29.712
Claire has a capsule piece.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.304
(knocking)
TOM:
Got your morning chai.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.975
What's that?
An anonymous package.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.560
It has the same
copper alloy used

10:44.602 --> 10:46.187
on Barton's spacecraft, but...

10:46.228 --> 10:48.147
I don't recognize the design.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.358
Do you, Tom?

10:50.399 --> 10:52.818
Uh... let me see it.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.698
It's just
some vintage Swift tech

10:57.740 --> 10:59.742
that I ordered.
Oh.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.827
It's my personal property,
Claire.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.704
It's a piece
of unknown technology

11:03.746 --> 11:05.748
that came addressed
to the company.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.044
Dr. Wilson...

11:10.086 --> 11:11.837
please run
a diagnostics check on that.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.297
Yeah, sure.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.968
That's lukewarm.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.096
Try again.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.225
Oh, you look so handsome.
(chuckles)

11:24.266 --> 11:25.893
Even if you won't cut your hair.

11:27.895 --> 11:31.440
I'm looking forward
to our mother-son dance.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.735
Since it is rite of
passage or whatever,

11:34.777 --> 11:37.530
um, could my mom come?

11:40.116 --> 11:42.910
Violet is not part
of our family.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.538
I'm old enough to decide--
Angelino Kareem Swift.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.790
Your, uh, bow tie is

11:47.832 --> 11:49.625
too loose.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.961
Thank you.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.464
And while you're here...

11:55.506 --> 11:57.758
You are a Swift now,
and you deserve

11:57.800 --> 12:00.177
to look fabulous. Look at that.
(chuckles)

12:00.219 --> 12:02.096
Thank you.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.060
Why would someone mail us
a capsule piece?

12:08.102 --> 12:10.104
Maybe it's some
kind of trap.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.898
Mm. We can solve that later.
Right now,

12:12.940 --> 12:14.608
we need to get it back
from Claire's

12:14.650 --> 12:17.445
poorly manicured clutches.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.281
Meet the CEO vault.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.992
Nine inches of reinforced steel

12:23.033 --> 12:25.453
only accessible
from my dad's old office.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.413
Designed by yours truly.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.248
I'll disable
the cameras,

12:29.290 --> 12:30.750
bypass the biometric security,

12:30.791 --> 12:32.209
and lift the capsule piece.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.627
All on a Sunday.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.045
ZENZI:
Why the rush?

12:35.087 --> 12:36.672
Claire recognized
the outer casing

12:36.714 --> 12:39.133
as the same unique alloy
used on Barton's spaceship.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.093
Her head of tech is
already investigating.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.637
Wilson's gonna find
a creation timestamp

12:43.679 --> 12:45.639
is dated after my dad's ship
exploded.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.808
Meaning they'll
see it was created

12:47.850 --> 12:49.518
after Barton
supposedly died.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.520
Anyone discovers
that my dad is still alive,

12:51.562 --> 12:53.856
it's only a matter of time
before The Road Back finds out.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.232
You two need
to keep Claire

12:55.274 --> 12:56.734
and Lorraine busy
at the cotillion,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.277
while I go get heisty with it.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.945
"The cotillion"?
So we're just gonna

12:59.987 --> 13:02.323
conveniently forget
my past with the uppity

13:02.364 --> 13:04.909
and myopic excuse
for DuBois' Talented Tenth?

13:04.950 --> 13:07.453
They dropped me
like last year's outlet rejects

13:07.495 --> 13:08.996
when my parents lost
their money.

13:09.038 --> 13:12.291
Those debutantes gossiped...

13:12.333 --> 13:14.168
and spread rumors.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.170
And Regina Jackson?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.380
BOTH:
May her ankles ever be ashy!

13:18.422 --> 13:20.007
...stole my escort.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.051
It was hell.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.721
This... is to save my dad.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.433
Please?

13:29.475 --> 13:32.186
(sighs)
Hmm? Okay!

13:32.228 --> 13:34.271
That sounds like a yes sigh.
Good, um...

13:34.313 --> 13:36.440
let's prepare a vault heist,
shall we?

13:36.482 --> 13:39.068
BARCLAY: Message from Quinn:
"Where are you?

13:39.109 --> 13:41.195
"It's 3:00 p.m.
People still work at 3:00 p.m.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.656
Unsure if you're aware."

13:43.697 --> 13:45.407
Crap.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.994
Do jobs just expect you
to be available at all times?

13:53.082 --> 13:55.709
But I finished all my work
for today, so...

13:55.751 --> 13:58.379
(phone chimes)
Yeah, that is the fun
thing about work.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.673
There is always more.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.299
(groans)

14:02.341 --> 14:05.135
Looks like Claire lost
her reading glasses again.

14:05.177 --> 14:08.097
50th time today.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.683
A purse full of backups?

14:10.724 --> 14:12.852
You must be really good
at your job.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.478
Yeah, tragically good.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.438
You know, I...

14:16.480 --> 14:19.358
joined Swift to be a
concept artist, but I was told

14:19.400 --> 14:21.986
I had to "pay my dues"
as Claire's assistant first.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.905
That was four years,

14:24.947 --> 14:27.575
one week and... two days ago.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.910
And I'm still
handing out glasses

14:29.952 --> 14:31.412
instead of
improving designs.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.622
Improving my company designs?

14:33.664 --> 14:36.208
Yes.
Okay.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.086
Show me what you got.

14:41.672 --> 14:42.840
Come on.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.175
Okay.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.428
Your AR Monovision.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.305
If you change
the component

14:49.346 --> 14:51.098
from a solid lens
to a liquid polymer,

14:51.140 --> 14:53.434
you could apply it
to windows, windshields

14:53.475 --> 14:55.394
for an AR experience

14:55.436 --> 14:56.896
anywhere.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.439
(chuckles)

14:58.480 --> 15:01.525
This is tremendously good... Q.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.652
No.
Okay, no, uh...

15:03.694 --> 15:05.529
Q-dawg?
No! No!

15:05.571 --> 15:07.615
Okay, look, I feel like

15:07.656 --> 15:10.326
you do not like me very much
and I don't know why.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.537
Take out your phone.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.416
Come on, take out your phone,
tweet something like, uh...

15:17.458 --> 15:19.418
"Boring day at
Swift Enterprises.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.587
Got to shake things up."

15:21.629 --> 15:23.088
(phone chimes)

15:24.340 --> 15:25.674
(tweet chirps)
And...

15:25.716 --> 15:26.759
(workers gasping)
PUBLICIST: He posted.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.011
Code Tom! Code Tom!

15:30.512 --> 15:33.933
QUINN:
You spout off and Swift stock
dips three points.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.435
Suddenly budgets are slashed,

15:36.477 --> 15:38.520
projects are shelved,

15:38.562 --> 15:40.481
contractors are laid off.

15:40.522 --> 15:43.984
There are real
consequences and

15:44.026 --> 15:46.403
you don't even realize it.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.701
(phone chimes)
Aw, crap!

15:52.743 --> 15:54.828
Okay, I just...
I got to go handle

15:54.870 --> 15:57.498
some cotillion stuff,
but...
Yeah.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.668
I appreciate you.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.004
Thank you.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.173
Quinn.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.011
Mission: save my relationship
with my mom,

16:11.053 --> 16:14.640
while heisting the capsule piece
to save the life of my dad.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.267
Claire limited my company access

16:17.309 --> 16:19.687
to only inventions
I've written copy for.

16:19.728 --> 16:22.690
Swift Lush Nanocream
and AR Monovision.

16:22.731 --> 16:26.318
But I have other inventions
I can draw from.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.697
BARCLAY:
What car, Tom?

16:29.738 --> 16:32.533
TOM:
Hmm, the red Corvette.

16:32.574 --> 16:36.412
A beast to race from cotillion
to Swift Enterprises. What shoe?

16:36.453 --> 16:37.871
Uh, black leather ankle boots.

16:37.913 --> 16:41.417
Perfect for both
cotillions and crime.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.043
TOM:
While I'm breaking
into the CEO vault,

16:43.085 --> 16:44.670
I need both of you

16:44.712 --> 16:46.046
at the cotillion.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.215
Isaac, you'll wear
the Insta-Tom.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.218
Conceived after too many
New Year's Eve invites.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.053
Oh, yes, back in the day,

16:53.095 --> 16:55.848
I had to be in five places
at one time without losing

16:55.889 --> 16:57.307
links in my hoe-tation.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.809
It'll project

16:58.851 --> 17:00.769
a hologram of my face
onto your body

17:00.811 --> 17:03.230
and mimic my voice. Hmm?

17:03.272 --> 17:05.190
I had a nightmare
like this once.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.358
TOM: Ooh, forgot to turn
the voice function on.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.069
This is my nightmare,
too.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.988
Lorraine will know
I'm not you.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.448
Just stay
in her line of sight.

17:12.489 --> 17:13.949
I'll be back
in 45 minutes,

17:13.991 --> 17:15.701
just in time
for Lino's debut.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.661
We have two days
to prep, okay?

17:17.703 --> 17:19.913
♪ ♪

17:23.375 --> 17:24.877
(phone chimes)

17:25.752 --> 17:27.921
ISAAC: Haven't been able to tell
Lorraine about Violet yet.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.631
Be patient.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.427
LINO:
No one cares what I want.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.846
(phone chimes)

17:35.888 --> 17:38.432
(heavy breathing)

18:07.544 --> 18:10.297
(line ringing)

18:10.339 --> 18:11.965
Hello.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.468
WOMAN:
Rolling Meadows Extended Care.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.304
I'd like to speak
to Violet Warren, please.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.014
Please hold.

18:25.437 --> 18:28.232
JONES:
Black cotillions are a tradition
that spans back a century.

18:28.273 --> 18:31.819
A rite of passage
for our young people

18:31.860 --> 18:34.238
to celebrate their beauty,

18:34.279 --> 18:37.783
their legacy,
and their accomplishments.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.828
(indistinct chatter)

18:40.869 --> 18:43.330
LORRAINE:
You're here.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.415
I owe Claire $20.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.418
Oh, I came just in time
to witness that entrance.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.838
You could give lessons.

18:50.879 --> 18:54.216
You think Naomi Campbell created
her walk all by herself?

18:54.258 --> 18:57.052
(both chuckle)

18:57.094 --> 19:00.389
LORRAINE:
She looks about as happy
as a child being dragged

19:00.430 --> 19:02.391
to a ten-hour braid appointment.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.268
You know, if you really want
to help me tonight,

19:04.309 --> 19:07.187
you can convince Zenzi to give
the debutantes a pep talk.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.189
She keeps turning me down.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.108
I don't think
I'm the right...

19:11.150 --> 19:13.569
Lino. Who's this

19:13.610 --> 19:15.487
dapper young man?

19:17.030 --> 19:19.116
(indistinct chatter)

19:23.162 --> 19:25.581
We'd love to have you out
to the Oak Bluffs this summer.

19:25.622 --> 19:28.750
You'd love the house-- our view
of the harbor is unmatched.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.544
Especially since the $2 million

19:30.586 --> 19:32.880
renovation we just finished.
LORRAINE: Mm. Mm-hmm.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.549
Mm. Oh.
Your favorite.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.843
Champagne punch?

19:37.885 --> 19:39.553
Uh, mm-hmm.
With Grand Marnier.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.722
Just like
at the Conservation Gala.
Mmm!

19:41.763 --> 19:43.974
(clears throat)
Speaking of...

19:44.016 --> 19:45.475
have you considered donating

19:45.517 --> 19:47.311
to the Vineyard's
Conservation Project?

19:47.352 --> 19:50.439
They're three million short.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.858
Sounds like you have that
in the couch cushions.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.402
Well, it's not that extensive
a renovation.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.863
And we're barely there.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.907
(all chuckle)

19:59.948 --> 20:01.909
TOM:
Mm...

20:01.950 --> 20:03.702
I saw Dad do that.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.412
Anytime somebody
wanted to flex,

20:05.454 --> 20:07.789
he'd redirect to see what's
really in that bank account.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.917
Hmm.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.252
My grandparents said we can
meet our future husbands

20:12.294 --> 20:14.796
tonight... but my escort is
aggressively basic.

20:14.838 --> 20:17.257
(whispers):
Oh, you owe me, Tom.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.593
Hi. Hello. I'm Zenzi.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.595
Uh, Mrs. Swift asked me

20:21.637 --> 20:24.056
to come in here and
check in on you ladies.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.682
Let me guess, you're here
to tell us how important

20:25.724 --> 20:27.726
cotillion is
to our futures?

20:27.768 --> 20:30.479
A teenager masking
vulnerability with sarcasm.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.648
How novel.

20:32.689 --> 20:34.608
Sorry.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.694
Uh, these things just make me
a little combative.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.738
I was tricked
into being here.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.907
I'm one of
the scholarship winners.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.201
Only accepting money
means dressing

20:44.243 --> 20:46.954
up as Tyler Perry's production
of The Nutcracker.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.957
Listen, just
remember that...

20:49.998 --> 20:51.792
you were chosen

20:51.833 --> 20:54.294
because of your talent
and intelligence.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.546
This is not

20:56.588 --> 20:59.091
the be-all end-all
they make out to be.

20:59.132 --> 21:02.052
Zenzi Fullington.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.470
If it wasn't for
that same fivehead,

21:03.512 --> 21:05.180
I might not have
recognized you.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.848
Sounds like you don't think
cotillion is important.

21:06.890 --> 21:09.059
Regina Jackson.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.937
Because... of course.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.772
I was simply explaining

21:13.814 --> 21:15.816
that the cotillion
doesn't have to dictate

21:15.857 --> 21:17.901
your entire life.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.861
Then why do girls like you

21:19.903 --> 21:22.155
whine about being left out?

21:22.197 --> 21:24.908
What you pretend is "elitism"
is actually just having

21:24.950 --> 21:28.245
high standards, but I guess
that's hard for the Swift

21:28.287 --> 21:29.955
charity case
to understand.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.792
Zenzi's escort dropped her
in high school.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.628
And her ex-boyfriend Marcus
just did the same thing.

with schizophrenia,

35:15.321 --> 35:17.281
right before she graduated
high school,

35:17.323 --> 35:19.575
we tried
to get her help.

35:19.617 --> 35:22.537
But she couldn't see
she had a problem.

35:22.578 --> 35:24.664
Refused the
medication.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.415
So the best I could do
was to donate a wing

35:26.457 --> 35:28.126
to a treatment facility

35:28.167 --> 35:30.336
so that they'd always
keep a bed open for her.

35:30.378 --> 35:33.172
I was trying to protect Lino

35:33.214 --> 35:35.258
by keeping them apart
until he could understand.

35:35.299 --> 35:38.052
I am sorry. I wish I could...
No, honey, listen.

35:38.094 --> 35:39.720
You were wonderful.

35:39.762 --> 35:42.515
Your...
your invention.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.809
Your brilliance.

35:45.893 --> 35:48.187
You saved the day.

35:50.064 --> 35:51.983
Maybe I was too harsh

35:52.024 --> 35:54.152
about your suspension.

35:54.193 --> 35:56.279
You showed great
leadership tonight.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.905
But I've been careless
of my actions

35:57.947 --> 36:00.241
and how they affect others.

36:00.283 --> 36:02.243
Tonight doesn't make up
for that.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.162
That is the maturity

36:04.203 --> 36:05.955
that I've always wanted to see.

36:09.417 --> 36:12.211
I'm reinstating you
to your previous position.

36:13.504 --> 36:14.714
We need you.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.967
Oh!

36:18.968 --> 36:20.636
Thank you.

36:22.597 --> 36:25.850
Oh, uh, Claire's assistant,

36:25.892 --> 36:28.728
Quinn, could I promote them
to R&D?

36:28.769 --> 36:31.522
They have
some very useful ideas.

36:31.564 --> 36:34.025
All right.

36:35.776 --> 36:37.945
Oh, no. No, no, no.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.697
Honey, everyone will stare.

36:39.739 --> 36:41.115
I can't...
Come on.

36:41.157 --> 36:44.118
That walk deserves
another entrance moment.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.871
And everybody's
always staring.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.998
We're Swifts.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.125
♪ ♪

36:54.795 --> 36:56.672
After you.

37:02.929 --> 37:05.514
♪ ♪

37:21.489 --> 37:23.199
My, my, my.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.952
How far the Swifts have fallen.

37:25.993 --> 37:28.287
You really haven't changed
since high school.

37:28.329 --> 37:30.206
Retinoids and Botox.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.292
No, I mean that you're still
so miserable that you delight

37:33.334 --> 37:35.002
in others'
misfortune.

37:35.044 --> 37:37.004
You know,
I'm happy to be a Swift

37:37.046 --> 37:39.423
charity case,
because they only support

37:39.465 --> 37:41.259
promising ideas.

37:44.136 --> 37:45.972
Who's supporting
your Botox,

37:46.013 --> 37:48.099
Regina?

37:53.688 --> 37:56.482
And I'd up that
Botox dosage.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.901
You're looking
a little creased.

38:02.905 --> 38:04.657
TOM:
Maybe...

38:04.699 --> 38:07.368
I was wrong tonight.
(scoffs)

38:07.410 --> 38:08.953
Look, if being
at the cotillion

38:08.995 --> 38:12.665
hurts this much for you,
then I need to respect it.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.460
Sorry I pushed you, sis.

38:18.462 --> 38:20.548
I'm sorry, too.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.469
(chuckles)
You are remarkable.

38:25.511 --> 38:28.180
(laughs)
Oh.

38:28.222 --> 38:31.225
Claire asked me if
I wanted a promotion.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.060
I turned her down.

38:33.102 --> 38:36.063
Because of me?
Oh, that is not my...
Oh, no, mm-mm.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.858
Because I don't want to work
for anyone else anymore.

38:40.234 --> 38:42.028
Yeah, I'm starting

38:42.069 --> 38:44.238
a tech incubator
at Swift Enterprises.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.907
To identify
up-and-coming inventors

38:46.949 --> 38:51.412
who haven't had all the
same opportunities as...

38:53.080 --> 38:55.708
Yeah, it'll be
a new frontier

38:55.750 --> 38:57.877
in Swift innovation.

38:57.918 --> 38:59.712
And I'm gonna run it.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.464
And Claire said yes.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.424
Oh.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.884
Sounds great, Zenzi.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.427
Mm.
I approve.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.554
(scoffs)

39:08.596 --> 39:11.515
I wasn't asking

39:11.557 --> 39:14.226
for your permission.

39:14.268 --> 39:17.104
Mm-hmm.

39:21.650 --> 39:23.694
(indistinct chatter)

39:25.363 --> 39:27.573
Barclay?

39:27.615 --> 39:29.700
Where are we with uploading
the capsule piece data?

39:29.742 --> 39:31.744
BARCLAY:
100% complete.

39:31.786 --> 39:34.205
We have all the data from
the destroyed capsule piece.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.713
25 seconds!

39:44.090 --> 39:45.591
(groans)

39:45.633 --> 39:47.760
Barclay, this is the liquid

39:47.802 --> 39:50.304
AR Monovision prototype.

39:50.346 --> 39:52.473
Upload a decaying version
of Dad's video

39:52.515 --> 39:55.559
to the polymer as I'm spraying
it onto Claire's glasses.

39:57.061 --> 40:00.439
The video will play when
she activates the capsule piece.

40:00.481 --> 40:03.234
Replace the audio
with the following.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.987
This is Barton Swift.

40:07.029 --> 40:09.031
My will is to be amended
so that my wife,

40:09.073 --> 40:11.283
Lorraine, and my son, Thomas,

40:11.325 --> 40:14.537
receive an equal split
of Swift enterprises.

40:14.578 --> 40:16.705
Lorraine...

40:16.747 --> 40:18.958
I know you will guide Tom

40:18.999 --> 40:21.043
