00:11.429 --> 00:13.556
[opening credit music]

00:31.449 --> 00:33.117
[Charlie] Yes
team! Let me see that--

00:33.117 --> 00:35.077
Oh! Niffty, nice side swipe!

00:35.077 --> 00:36.328
Pentious,
like to see that effort.

00:36.579 --> 00:38.456
[Sir Pentious]
Teamwork makes the dream work!

00:38.456 --> 00:39.373
Yes! I heard that once...

00:40.166 --> 00:42.293
-[Niffty] Train, train, train.

00:42.293 --> 00:43.586
[Vox] No fucking way!

00:43.586 --> 00:45.296
They're going to fight?

00:45.296 --> 00:47.798
Oh, my God. Ha ha ha ha!

00:47.798 --> 00:50.468
Oh. Looks like your little hotel
didn't work out so well.

00:50.468 --> 00:52.595
[chuckles]

00:52.595 --> 00:58.142
Oh Alastor, I cannot
wait to watch you get FUCKED!

00:58.142 --> 01:00.144
[sinister laugh, sinister music]

01:00.144 --> 01:02.229
[gentle music]

01:02.229 --> 01:05.399
[Charlie sighs] Oh, I wish
my mom was here to see this.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.359
[Vaggie] The cannibals
seem ready to fight.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.611
Are we?

01:08.611 --> 01:10.404
[Sir Pentious]
Fear not, damsels.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.740
I shall have the staff
ready for victorious combat!

01:12.740 --> 01:14.533
[Vaggie] What in
the hell are you supposed to be?

01:14.533 --> 01:16.660
General Pentious,
reporting for duty.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.456
I'll turn those rapscallions
into soldiers in no time at all.

01:20.456 --> 01:21.624
Thank you, Pen.

01:21.624 --> 01:23.292
What can I do to help?

01:23.292 --> 01:25.419
I'm glad you asked, soldier.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.504
The base needs fortifications.

01:26.504 --> 01:29.131
Reinforce the southern wall.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.341
Create a moat
around the perimeter

01:30.341 --> 01:31.759
to stop a ground assault.

01:33.301 --> 01:36.388
[Charlie] How about this?
If you see an angel, stab it.

01:36.388 --> 01:37.765
[Niffty]
Oooohh...[evil chuckle]

01:37.765 --> 01:39.642
Stab! Stab! Stab!

01:39.642 --> 01:41.477
-[Angel] Hey, hey, hey, hey.
-[Charlie] Not Him!

01:41.477 --> 01:43.646
[Niffty giggles]

01:43.646 --> 01:45.523
[Vaggie in a drill sergeant
manner] Listen up, sinners!

01:45.523 --> 01:47.691
We got twenty four hours before
the extermination begins

01:47.691 --> 01:49.151
Let's get to work.
[epic music]

01:50.319 --> 01:51.362
-[Vaggie] So,
you wanna aim here, here...

01:51.362 --> 01:53.405
-[Vox] Oh, they suck.
-[Sir Pentious] Yes.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.782
-Watch this .

01:54.782 --> 01:56.491
-[ Vox laughing]
Oh they suck so bad

01:56.491 --> 01:58.118
[epic music continues]
[Vox] Oh, God.

01:58.661 --> 02:00.746
They're going to fucking die.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.665
They're-- They're going to die.

02:02.665 --> 02:04.500
[mic feeds back]
Hello?

02:04.500 --> 02:06.293
I want to thank
everyone for coming.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.795
Even people who aren't
staying here yet...Cherri.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.173
Look, I can't
resist a fight, okay?

02:11.173 --> 02:14.218
Especially when I get to
tag team with this fuckhead.

02:14.218 --> 02:19.682
Tomorrow, the exorcist angels will
face a Hell ready to defend itself and win.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.225
[Vaggie]
Yeah!

02:21.225 --> 02:22.601
Yeah, we will! Tell 'em, baby!

02:22.601 --> 02:25.688
Yes. And we are--
we are going to win!

02:25.688 --> 02:27.857
But in case we don't,

02:28.482 --> 02:32.903
I want you all to know...
that getting to know you

02:32.903 --> 02:35.573
has been
the biggest honor of my life.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.325
Whatever
redemption really means,

02:38.826 --> 02:40.536
[emotive music]
I know you all tried.

02:40.536 --> 02:43.539
I have seen
the good in all of you.

02:43.539 --> 02:44.874
And it's...

02:44.874 --> 02:46.667
I--I'm just...

02:48.460 --> 02:50.796
[gushes]
I love you all... so much,

02:50.796 --> 02:55.718
and-- and live tonight
however you want because--

02:55.718 --> 02:59.346
We're all going to die! Hahahah!

03:00.264 --> 03:01.974
[Vaggie] All right,
let's give it up for not dying!

03:01.974 --> 03:05.227
Love not dying!
Drinks?

03:05.227 --> 03:08.355
-[Vaggie] I mean, personally, I'm excited.
It's been a long time since I stabbed anyone

03:08.355 --> 03:09.773
and really meant
it, you know what I mean?

03:09.773 --> 03:10.900
-[Cherri Bomb] Cheers, bitches!
-[Husk] Yeah!

03:11.901 --> 03:13.235
[ice clinks in drinks]
[Angel] Here's to us!

03:13.235 --> 03:17.615
[Sir Pentious] Here's to being
alive today and not dying tomorrow.

03:17.615 --> 03:19.700
-[all cheers]
-[Cherri Bomb] Chug, chug, chug!

03:19.700 --> 03:22.620
[Alastor] Ah, the celebratory
night before a courageous last stand.

03:22.953 --> 03:28.250
It's been a surprising thrill to
witness these wayward souls find connection.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.462
Almost makes one sentimental,
eh Niffty?

03:31.462 --> 03:33.505
I really like them, Alastor.

03:33.756 --> 03:36.926
They let me put on roach
puppet shows without booing!

03:36.926 --> 03:39.803
Ahh, an enjoyable
collective to be around.

03:40.512 --> 03:43.265
I admit one
could get accustomed.

03:44.308 --> 03:47.478
[Niffty] I dub thee King Roach.

03:47.478 --> 03:52.399
Oh, to understand your twisted
little mind. Hahaha.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.736
[both laugh]

03:55.736 --> 03:57.279
Last day of afterlife,
[gentle music]

03:57.613 --> 04:00.532
and you're not off snorting
a line off some hunk's abs?

04:00.532 --> 04:03.702
Ehh, you fucked one cannibal
pool boy, you fucked 'em all.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.496
I guess you have changed.

04:06.455 --> 04:10.918
Hey, Charlie said live tonight
however we wanted,

04:10.918 --> 04:14.505
so pour me a fresh one,
and let's get to living.

04:14.505 --> 04:15.464
[Angel chuckles]

04:16.298 --> 04:18.466
[Sir Pentious] Miss Bomb...?

04:18.466 --> 04:20.302
-Cherri?
-Yeah.

04:20.302 --> 04:21.803
[romantic piano music]
I want to tell you... that I...

04:22.972 --> 04:25.057
I love...

04:25.057 --> 04:29.395
I'd love to wish you good
luck in the battle ahead.

04:29.395 --> 04:30.813
Okay.

04:30.813 --> 04:34.817
You are... Have always been a
worthy opponent.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.444
With the most...

04:37.444 --> 04:41.824
brilliant explosive contraptions
I've ever seen.

04:41.824 --> 04:43.826
Uh... Thanks?

04:43.826 --> 04:44.994
Anyway, I guess--

04:46.495 --> 04:48.497
[Sir Pentious speaking quickly]
Please don't die tomorrow. Okay. Bye.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.082
[Angel] Ya know,
you could totally tap that.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.918
Tss, don't be gross.
[slurps drink]

04:53.585 --> 04:56.505
Cuz, you know,
I hear he's got two dicks.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.007

05:08.559 --> 05:11.020
I'm sorry... I'm...

05:11.020 --> 05:12.771
I'm just so scared.

match for me, edge-lord.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.304

than anyone what a soul can accomplish

when they take
charge of their own fate.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.934

This is better than sex.

09:58.724 --> 10:01.059
Have to disagree with you there.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.811
Radio's not dead,

Before I take your life,

12:31.293 --> 12:35.255

That's some crazy shit,

You always were weak.

13:31.269 --> 13:34.272

Do it, then.
Correct your mistake.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.881
Seriously,
you're pathetic, you know that?

14:00.340 --> 14:03.218
Ready to die rather
than accepting mercy?

14:03.218 --> 14:05.387
No, live.

14:05.387 --> 14:09.224
Live knowing that you only do
because I let you...

14:09.224 --> 14:10.600
The failure.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.060
[Charlie

15:03.111 --> 15:04.946
So, this is what

15:04.946 --> 15:07.198
Gotta say, you really
let yourself go buddy.

15:07.198 --> 15:11.661
[Adam laughs] You judgin' me?
You're the most hated being in all of creation!

15:11.661 --> 15:14.664
Well, your first wife didn't
seem to hate what I had to offer,

15:14.664 --> 15:17.584

Bow-chicka-wow-wow.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.628

fucking clown or something.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.102
I started everything on Earth.

16:17.102 --> 16:20.105
All of mankind came from
these fucking nuts.

16:20.105 --> 16:21.648
You all should be worshiping me,

16:21.648 --> 16:26.653

Please.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.520

to fend off the angelic attack

17:26.171 --> 17:28.590

17:28.590 --> 17:30.467
In an unseen turn of events,

17:30.467 --> 17:33.803
our demonic head
honcho Lucifer stepped in

17:33.803 --> 17:36.556
to save his daughter's ass
in the last moment.

17:36.556 --> 17:40.518
We're also hearing reports
that Adam, leader of the Angelic Legions,

17:40.518 --> 17:43.146
first man and
totally fuckable bad boy,

17:43.146 --> 17:45.648

The janitor said, quote,

17:47.358 --> 17:50.278
"Charlie told me
to stab, so I did."

17:50.278 --> 17:52.447
Anyway, congrats
to Charlie and her crew
