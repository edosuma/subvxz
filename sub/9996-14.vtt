Previously on Medium:

00:02.436 --> 00:04.471
Allison Dubois?
I'm Caitlyn Lynch.

00:04.471 --> 00:07.108
I'm with the Lydecker
Corporation.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.742
You're offering me a job?

00:08.742 --> 00:11.679
What exactly does it mean when
they say "high six figures"?

00:11.679 --> 00:13.214
It means you need
to call her tomorrow.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.615
You need to find out
what this is all about.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.283
Do you remember
Stacey Anne Burrows?

00:16.283 --> 00:17.618
She died yesterday.
ARIEL:
What?

00:17.618 --> 00:20.020
Her car filled up
with water and she drowned.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.456
Stacey Anne?
Is that you?

00:22.456 --> 00:25.359
I tried studying last
night... and I couldn't.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.062
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't get focused.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.863
I used to have problems
concentrating.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.565
My doctor
gave me these.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.800
Maybe just one.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.834
Scanlon just called.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.669
They found the remains
of Autumn Colville.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.638
Looks like we got ourselves
a serial killer.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.541
Allison Dubois,
Detective Brad Auerbach.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.576
ALLISON:
That's the same man--

00:42.576 --> 00:44.678
the one that I saw in my dream;
the one that I saw

00:44.678 --> 00:46.380
in Autumn Colville's
apartment.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.515
I'm not gonna interrogate

00:47.515 --> 00:49.217
the senior detective
on the case!

00:49.217 --> 00:50.518
Lee, it's me.

00:50.518 --> 00:51.719
I just had another dream.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.254
I think it happened again--
another murder.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.555
I'm standing in her house
right now.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.124
You need to find
Detective Auerbach.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.858
You need to bring him in
right away.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.593
I been with him
all night.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.928
Brad Auerbach
didn't do this.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.663
He didn't do
any of it.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.864
He couldn't have.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.099
(sighs)

01:06.800 --> 01:10.171
* *

01:13.641 --> 01:16.710
Good morning.
May I help you?

01:16.710 --> 01:18.179
Yes.
My name is Allison Dubois.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.380
I'm a new employee.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.215
I was hoping
that you'd have directions

01:21.215 --> 01:22.783
and a pass here for me.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.552
Allison?

01:24.552 --> 01:27.288
I had a feeling you'd be
getting here about this time.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.722
I thought I'd welcome you
in person.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.024
Are you excited
about your first day?

01:31.024 --> 01:32.793
I'm excited.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.228
I'm nervous.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.197
I'm terrified.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.798
I can completely relate.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.500
I was all of the above.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.634
Come on.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.570
Let's get started.

01:45.273 --> 01:48.509
Guess who works here.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.944
Someone else
who has the same name as me?

01:50.944 --> 01:52.813
(laughing)

01:52.813 --> 01:54.282
Go on in.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.657
(gasping)

02:03.657 --> 02:06.194
Yeah. Takes your breath away,
doesn't it?

02:08.329 --> 02:10.231
(gasping)

02:10.231 --> 02:14.435
Captioning sponsored by
CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK
TELEVISION

02:14.435 --> 02:18.572
and TOYOTA.
Moving Forward.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.947
I just don't want
to look out of place.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.915
Well, I've never been
to the place,

03:01.915 --> 03:04.318
so I can't be of any help
in that regard.

03:04.318 --> 03:07.321
But I like... that one.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.957
No, no, no. I have a bad
feeling about that one.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.260
About a suit?

03:12.260 --> 03:14.495
I just... I want to make
a good first impression.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.997
Well, these people
came after you.

03:16.997 --> 03:20.200
You have met the burden
of a first impression

03:20.200 --> 03:21.702
and conquered it.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.937
Mom, there's a big black car
in our driveway.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.375
The limo's already here,
and I'm not even dressed.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.176
Is that a limo?

03:29.176 --> 03:30.944
What's going on?

03:30.944 --> 03:32.446
Did Mommy get famous

03:32.446 --> 03:34.282
and someone forget
to tell us?

03:34.282 --> 03:35.816
No, no, no, honey.
Nobody got famous.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.286
Mommy just got a new car
with her new job.

03:38.286 --> 03:39.687
They're picking me up
this morning,

03:39.687 --> 03:42.256
so I'm able to drive
the new car home this evening.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.857
Cool.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.793
Wait, can we take
the limo to school

03:45.793 --> 03:48.028
and make all the
other kids jealous?

03:48.028 --> 03:49.162
Bridgette.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.999
Well, can I at least go outside
and take pictures of it?

03:51.999 --> 03:54.902
You know what? You're going
to have to handle this.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.970
I don't have time.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.340
(phone ringing)

03:59.340 --> 04:02.009
Yep?

04:02.009 --> 04:03.277
Allison?

04:03.277 --> 04:07.281
I just needed to be reassured
that God doesn't smite people

04:07.281 --> 04:09.016
who ride to work
in big black limousines

04:09.016 --> 04:11.419
with handsome drivers
who offer you hot coffee

04:11.419 --> 04:14.021
and your choice of newspapers.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.689
I can't. God does.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.759
But I hear they're all smiling
when the end does come.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.728
So, uh,
they're treating you well, huh?

04:21.728 --> 04:23.897
Well,
I really haven't started yet,

04:23.897 --> 04:27.034
but "well" doesn't even begin
to describe it.

04:28.969 --> 04:32.540
Do you want to hear
the nutty part?

04:32.540 --> 04:34.408
I miss City Hall.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.209
Allison, it's early
Monday morning.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.345
No one's even here yet.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.380
There's nothing to have missed.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.648
You know,
just before the weekend,

04:40.648 --> 04:42.182
I had kind of a crazy hunch.

04:42.182 --> 04:45.052
Detective Scanlon didn't happen
to mention it to you, did he?

04:45.052 --> 04:47.120
It involved Detective Auerbach.
(knocking)

04:47.120 --> 04:48.055
No.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.624
But I've got Lee standing
in my doorway right now.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.225
Is there something
you want me to ask him?

04:52.225 --> 04:56.430
It's Allison Dubois calling
from her chauffeured limousine

04:56.430 --> 04:58.298
to say hi to the little people.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.334
Oh, yeah. Dubois.
Which one was she?

05:00.334 --> 05:02.269
Ha, ha, ha.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.303
All right. Never mind.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.472
DEVALOS:
Allison.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.206
Forget about this case.
Start your new job.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.308
Make a lot of money.
I may need to borrow some.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.178
Yeah, me, too. You were always
my favorite, Allison.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.313
Oh...
(blows raspberry)

05:15.449 --> 05:18.919
* *

05:26.427 --> 05:28.061
Good morning.
May I help you?

05:28.061 --> 05:29.963
Allison!

05:29.963 --> 05:32.800
I had a feeling you'd be
getting here about this time.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.334
I thought I'd welcome you
in person.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.937
Excited about
your first day?

05:42.643 --> 05:44.612
Guess who works here.

05:44.612 --> 05:47.347
Someone else
with the same name as me?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.249
(chuckling)

05:49.249 --> 05:50.418
Go on in.

05:50.418 --> 05:53.487
Please. You do the honors.

06:00.994 --> 06:04.465
Yeah. Takes your breath
away, doesn't it?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.706
I can't believe it.
It's amazing.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.743
I'm glad you like it.

06:15.743 --> 06:19.046
You're going to be spending
a lot of time in here.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.914
I'm going to be forwarding you
a lot of material,

06:20.914 --> 06:23.451
and I want your impression
on all of it.

06:23.451 --> 06:26.319
As far as how you get
those impressions, well,

06:26.319 --> 06:28.689
if you need
to kick off your shoes,

06:28.689 --> 06:30.491
stretch out on your chair,

06:30.491 --> 06:32.460
let your mind wander...

06:32.460 --> 06:34.027
It's all part of the job.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.497
What, napping's part
of my job description?

06:36.497 --> 06:38.666
I call it "contemplation time."

06:38.666 --> 06:42.402
It keeps the other people around
here from getting jealous.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.472
But, to answer your question,
yes.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.639
Naps are cool.

06:45.639 --> 06:48.308
As long as you keep
an accurate log

06:48.308 --> 06:52.045
of everything you see
and pass it on to me.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.481
Oh.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.048
There is one other thing

06:55.048 --> 06:56.917
that I think we should
take care of today

06:56.917 --> 06:58.586
after our meeting
with Mr. Lydecker.

07:00.754 --> 07:04.124
How about you and I go on
a little shopping trip?

07:04.124 --> 07:05.392
(chuckles)

07:05.392 --> 07:07.094
Shopping?

07:08.796 --> 07:10.063
I don't pretend to understand

07:10.063 --> 07:12.032
exactly what it is
that Caitlyn does,

07:12.032 --> 07:15.969
but I am pragmatic enough
to see that it works.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.941
And now I found you, Allison.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.976
Caitlyn tells me
you have quite a gift.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.846
Yes. That's what she
keeps telling me, too.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.349
I'll try not
to let you down.

07:29.349 --> 07:32.119
Oh, you won't.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.788
Because I have
enormous confidence in you.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.227
This corporation thrives
because we excel at two things:

07:40.227 --> 07:43.864
innovation and secrecy.

07:43.864 --> 07:47.034
We breed the next
generation of ideas.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.336
And then we manage
and we cultivate those ideas,

07:49.336 --> 07:55.208
confident that our competitors
have no clue what we're up to.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.977
So, naturally,

07:56.977 --> 07:59.079
that creates a lot of temptation
for our employees.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.081
It would be very easy
for someone

08:01.081 --> 08:04.985
to supplement their income
by leaking company secrets

08:04.985 --> 08:08.321
to the press
or to one of our competitors.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.924
These are employee dossiers.

08:10.924 --> 08:14.762
I'd like you
to spend some time with them.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.129
See if there's

08:16.129 --> 08:18.766
anyone among this group
that gives you pause.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.268
(man sobbing)

08:23.003 --> 08:25.706
(sobbing)

08:32.511 --> 08:36.216
I'd be very anxious to hear
what you have to say.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.121
Ariel, I don't believe it.
You got a perfect score.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.756
In math. I didn't even think
that was possible.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.392
It was just a practice test.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.394
Still, I hate you.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.361
(both giggle)

08:48.361 --> 08:50.864
It's your fault, you know.
It's those pills.

08:50.864 --> 08:54.802
I don't know. I look the pills,
too, and I only got a 488.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.204
No, I mean,
without those pills,

08:57.204 --> 08:59.840
there's no way
I'd be able to do this.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.043
There's no way I'd be able
to focus or concentrate.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.580
That reminds me...

09:06.580 --> 09:08.315
I'm going to need some more.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.584
Look, I don't think I can.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.985
I just gave you a bunch.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.320
I don't refill my prescription
till next week.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.257
How about just one?

09:17.257 --> 09:18.859
I don't have one.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.161
You know my father counts these.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.501
I don't get it.

09:28.501 --> 09:31.705
I thought this was about you
being upset over Stacey Anne.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.141
You're not still upset
about her, are you?

09:37.210 --> 09:39.146
(sniffling)

09:41.181 --> 09:44.117
Look, all right, but I can
only give you two more.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.286
This is the last time,
seriously.

09:49.222 --> 09:52.726
* *

09:52.726 --> 09:54.862
(chuckling)

10:20.087 --> 10:22.823
Thank you.

10:22.823 --> 10:26.526
Okay, I give up.

10:26.526 --> 10:27.961
I'm sorry?

10:27.961 --> 10:29.196
Did you say something?

10:29.196 --> 10:31.098
I said, "I give up,"
trying to figure out

10:31.098 --> 10:32.966
what's going on in
that brain of yours.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.103
I can't read
your expression.

10:36.103 --> 10:39.106
Well, my expression,
that's, uh...

10:39.106 --> 10:40.741
Exhaustion.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.609
And amazement.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.778
This has been
an incredible day.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.513
You're happy?

10:46.513 --> 10:48.615
No, I'm miserable.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.350
You're buying me clothes,

10:50.350 --> 10:52.019
buying me a car.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.722
I get to meet Mr. Lydecker...

10:54.722 --> 10:55.989
He's pretty impressive,
isn't he?

10:55.989 --> 10:59.059
He's one of the most
charismatic, uh,

10:59.059 --> 11:00.761
intimidating, fascinating...

11:00.761 --> 11:02.429
Tell me about it.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.800
You know, I saw him cry.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.802
I'm sorry?

11:08.802 --> 11:13.006
Well, we were sitting
in his office and I had a...

11:13.006 --> 11:15.042
I mean, he was just sobbing.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.044
It was as if someone had died.

11:17.044 --> 11:20.748
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

11:20.748 --> 11:24.317
I've worked for the man
for almost a decade,

11:24.317 --> 11:26.253
and no.

11:28.722 --> 11:32.092
You must be very good.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.894
I think that this
is one insight

11:33.894 --> 11:36.396
that you should probably
keep out of your log.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.368
Yes, of course.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.436
See anything?

11:43.436 --> 11:44.738
Nope.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.241
Yep.
(horn honking)

11:49.843 --> 11:53.380
Dad! Ariel!

11:53.380 --> 11:55.348
I think she's coming!

11:58.651 --> 12:01.221
Oh, wow! Can I borrow it?

12:02.756 --> 12:06.059
Hey, ask me how
my first day was.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.166
You're smiling.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.002
I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

12:15.002 --> 12:17.304
I said, "You're smiling."

12:17.304 --> 12:19.272
Oh, I guess I am.

12:20.307 --> 12:24.144
I actually had
a pretty wonderful day.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.781
I can't believe I hesitated
to take this job.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.783
Everyone there
is so nice.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.151
I mean, not that everybody

12:31.151 --> 12:35.155
at the district attorney's
office isn't nice, but...

12:35.155 --> 12:37.157
(sighs):
It's kind of refreshing

12:37.157 --> 12:39.359
not to ponder death
and evil every day.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.039
So what now?

12:52.039 --> 12:54.207
Dreams of new products

12:54.207 --> 12:56.476
and profit and
loss statements?

12:56.476 --> 12:58.411
We can only hope.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.349
We can only hope.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.325
* *

13:41.421 --> 13:43.356
* *

14:13.453 --> 14:15.388
* *

14:37.677 --> 14:39.612
(gasping)

14:41.814 --> 14:43.383
I saw it, Lee.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.219
Someone texted him the address
of Autumn Colville's apartment.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.620
But he didn't kill her.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.222
He just cleaned up
after whoever did.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.059
You sound like
what I'm saying is absurd.
I know.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.593
There's a reason for that.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.562
Allison, why would
Brad Auerbach,

14:55.562 --> 14:56.930
the guy who's heading up
the task force

14:56.930 --> 14:59.466
to catch this butcher, drive out
in the middle of the night

14:59.466 --> 15:02.802
and cut up bodies into easily
disposable pieces for him?

15:02.802 --> 15:04.004
Doesn't make any sense.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.472
I don't know,
maybe he knows the killer

15:05.472 --> 15:06.974
and he's trying
to protect him.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.508
Maybe he's getting paid for it.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.510
What difference
does it make, Lee?

15:10.510 --> 15:11.979
He's doing it.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.448
No. Sorry.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.384
You're talking
about Brad Auerbach.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.152
You're talking
about a fellow detective.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.887
Okay, look, I get it.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.622
You respect the guy.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.391
And-And maybe I'm crazy.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.360
But there has got to be a way
that you can look into this

15:27.360 --> 15:28.895
without setting
off alarms,

15:28.895 --> 15:30.697
without embarrassing
yourself.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.066
If you could just ask him
about the bag.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.068
There, there was this case
that he was using,

15:35.068 --> 15:38.871
this big, rolling black bag.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.473
He put all his tools in it,

15:40.473 --> 15:42.142
everything he needed
to clean up.

15:42.142 --> 15:45.145
It was like
a, a salesman's case.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.716
Or don't.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.718
Say hi to Lynn.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.320
Don't do that.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.457
"A big, black case."

15:57.457 --> 15:59.392
I'll try.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.229
Thank you.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.633
(phone ringing)

16:07.834 --> 16:08.935
Hello?

16:08.935 --> 16:10.070
MAN (on phone):
Joe, hi.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.005
This is Bill Whitaker,
Ashley's dad.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.974
Uh, we met at one of those,
uh, parent-teacher things.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.077
Do you have a minute?

16:17.077 --> 16:18.745
And this is the only employee

16:18.745 --> 16:21.081
that you're worried about?
Well, he's really

16:21.081 --> 16:22.882
the only person
who jumped out at me.

16:22.882 --> 16:26.986
I mean, he's the only person
I had a strong response to.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.489
A strong negative response.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.659
It's... It's hard
to put into words.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.128
So there's nothing specific,

16:35.128 --> 16:38.098
nothing that you can...

16:38.098 --> 16:39.232
put your finger on. Just...?

16:39.232 --> 16:41.468
Just a kind of darkness.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.071
Towards the company.
Towards you.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.777
I'm sorry.
I wish I had more to offer.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.346
I really don't even know
what he does for the company.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.981
Most of the information
in his file

16:54.981 --> 16:56.683
was blacked out with a marker.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.118
That's quite all right.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.988
I'm very familiar
with this particular employee.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.656
I appreciate your input.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.127
I'll handle this
matter personally.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.795
ALLISON:
When Mr. Lydecker

17:08.795 --> 17:10.696
says he's going to handle
something personally,

17:10.696 --> 17:12.531
what does that mean?
What does it mean?

17:12.531 --> 17:15.801
It means that if
he suspects someone
of being disloyal,

17:15.801 --> 17:17.837
that person usually
find themselves

17:17.837 --> 17:20.607
being transferred off
of our key projects.

17:20.607 --> 17:23.943
Basically, they're benched
until their contract runs out.

17:23.943 --> 17:28.013
Usually, they get the message
before then and move on.

17:28.013 --> 17:30.016
So if I share my impressions
about someone,

17:30.016 --> 17:31.851
I could ruin their career?

17:31.851 --> 17:34.854
Are you worried about
that kid you pointed out?

17:34.854 --> 17:38.291
Relax. Nothing's going
to happen to him.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.161
He's kind of a...
special case.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.830
He's Justin Lydecker.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.198
Mr. Lydecker's son.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.333
Oh, my God.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.368
I just accused
the CEO's son of, of...

17:48.368 --> 17:51.037
Being exactly who he is.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.240
Trust me, Allison.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.842
You are not the first
person to point out

17:55.842 --> 17:58.511
that Justin Lydecker
is never going to become

17:58.511 --> 17:59.879
the employee of the month.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.615
He's kind of a running
joke around here,

18:02.615 --> 18:06.953
the poster boy for
"just say yes" to anything.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.721
Drugs, clubbing...

18:08.721 --> 18:11.891
Lots of days Justin doesn't even
bother to show up around here.

18:11.891 --> 18:16.095
I don't know why Mr. Lydecker
even bothers to keep him around.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.764
I know he used to
think that one day

18:17.764 --> 18:19.966
maybe Justin would
take over for him.

18:19.966 --> 18:24.404
Now, I think he prays
that kid lives to see 30.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.505
WOMAN:
Mrs. Dubois?

18:25.505 --> 18:26.806
Your husband called
several times.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.509
He said he needs to speak
with you as soon as possible.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.311
Thank you. Excuse me.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.393
Hey.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.428
Aren't you guys
supposed to be at work?

18:48.428 --> 18:51.798
I got a call
from Ashley's father today.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.800
He's convinced that
his daughter is sharing

18:53.800 --> 18:55.368
her antianxiety medication
with you.

18:57.737 --> 18:58.871
Tell us this isn't true.

18:58.871 --> 19:02.175
Or that there's some aspect
of it that we don't understand.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.913
It's complicated.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.715
I'll bet it is.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.452
It wasn't for fun or anything.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.687
There was nothing fun about it.

19:16.256 --> 19:19.492
It's just...
the PSATs are coming up,

19:19.492 --> 19:22.028
and there's this girl
and she won't leave me alone,

19:22.028 --> 19:23.263
and she won't let me study

19:23.263 --> 19:25.365
or concentrate...
Wait a second.
Hold on. Hold on. What girl?

19:25.365 --> 19:28.968
Stacey Anne Burrows.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.504
Okay, so you took drugs?

19:31.504 --> 19:32.939
That makes no sense.

19:32.939 --> 19:36.042
Not drugs.

19:36.042 --> 19:39.746
It's like you said.
It's Ashley's prescription.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.381
And she takes it
so she can concentrate.

19:41.381 --> 19:44.284
And that's why I took it,
and it worked.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.953
She left me alone.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.558
Stacy Anne just...

19:58.631 --> 20:02.269
Wha... wha-what
am I missing?

20:06.639 --> 20:09.942
Stacey Anne... is she dead?

20:13.179 --> 20:15.615
(sobbing)

20:42.642 --> 20:44.344
Lee?

20:44.344 --> 20:46.078
Geez, buddy.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.147
What the hell are you doing here
at this hour?

20:48.147 --> 20:51.017
It's a good thing I got a change
of underwear inside.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.885
New development in the case.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.922
I was in the area, knew you were
just getting off detail...

20:55.922 --> 20:57.457
Thought I'd take a shot.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.392
At 2:00 in the morning?

20:59.392 --> 21:00.827
You sure you weren't
waiting for me?

21:00.827 --> 21:03.963
It seems like maybe
you were waiting for me.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.768
Yeah, well,
I guess maybe I was.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.670
Maybe I was waiting for you.

21:11.738 --> 21:14.006
All right,
so what's the big break?

21:14.006 --> 21:16.743
Turns out it's a team.

21:16.743 --> 21:17.977
Two guys.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.847
One guy does the deed.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.682
The other, he comes in
after the fact,

21:22.682 --> 21:25.084
gets rid of the body,
cleans up.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.853
Knows what he's doing, too.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.755
Leaves the place
forensically spotless.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.658
Okay.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.192
And where'd you get this?

21:33.192 --> 21:36.062
I mean who are you talking to
that I'm not talking to?

21:36.062 --> 21:37.930
Why? You want a name?

21:37.930 --> 21:40.232
Yeah. I want a name.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.701
I want to talk to the guy,

21:41.701 --> 21:43.936
'cause I got to say,
that doesn't sound right.

21:43.936 --> 21:47.106
I mean, I've heard
of serial killers

21:47.106 --> 21:48.007
working in pairs before.

21:48.007 --> 21:51.444
You know, like, uh,
thrill-killers

21:51.444 --> 21:53.446
taking turns,
but nothing like

21:53.446 --> 21:55.715
what you're describing.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.017
No, it doesn't make sense.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.119
I mean, what's in it
for the guy who cleans?

22:00.119 --> 22:01.354
I don't know.

22:01.354 --> 22:02.922
Money maybe.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.857
Maybe the guy doesn't make
that much.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.262
Maybe the guy's a cop.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.399
(scoffs)

22:12.399 --> 22:13.966
Well, that's nuts.

22:13.966 --> 22:18.037
Yeah, well, the thing is, I need
to look in that case, Brad.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.010
Me? You think it's me?

22:24.010 --> 22:28.047
I think I need to look
in that case.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.118
What are you doing, man?

22:32.118 --> 22:35.187
Have you lost your mind?

22:35.187 --> 22:36.856
It's me. It's Brad.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.358
Well, then the case
doesn't matter.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.897
Fine.

22:47.133 --> 22:50.169
I'm not a good forgetter, Lee.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.638
Just so you know,

22:51.638 --> 22:55.241
when this is over,
I'm not a good forgetter.

22:55.241 --> 22:56.308
(gunshot)

22:56.308 --> 22:59.111
(gasps)

23:00.346 --> 23:02.114
(phone keypad beeping)

23:02.114 --> 23:03.583
(line ringing)

23:03.583 --> 23:04.951
SCANLON:
Yeah?

23:04.951 --> 23:08.087
Lee, it's Allison.
Are you all right?

23:08.087 --> 23:09.756
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.191
My God, I just had
the most horrible dream.

23:12.191 --> 23:15.762
Detective Auerbach shot you.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.396
Yeah, well, not to worry.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.731
Your dream was wrong.

23:18.731 --> 23:21.568
Detective Auerbach
didn't kill me.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.869
I killed him.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.219
Good news.

23:40.219 --> 23:43.222
Forensics just finished
its preliminary analysis

23:43.222 --> 23:45.758
on the items from that black
case in Auerbach's garage.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.127
For starters, there
was a power saw

23:48.127 --> 23:50.530
with traces of skin, blood,
and bone on the blade.

23:50.530 --> 23:54.534
Obviously, we still need to make
a DNA match with the victims,

23:54.534 --> 23:57.737
but, um, from the sound of it,
I think you're going to be okay.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.540
Maybe even better
than okay.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.874
Everybody's on board:

24:01.874 --> 24:04.611
the mayor, the governor,
the chief of police.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.212
You're a hero, Lee.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.149
The guy drew on me.
I'm no hero.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.819
Sorry it took me so long
to hear you.

24:12.819 --> 24:15.054
It's okay.
I'm just happy you're alive.

24:15.054 --> 24:18.224
We're all just happy
that you're alive.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.760
SCANLON:
Doesn't seem fair.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.261
We can review
Brad's bank statements,

24:22.261 --> 24:23.630
check out his phone logs,

24:23.630 --> 24:26.265
see if we can figure out
who his sick partner is,

24:26.265 --> 24:28.334
but if nothing
shakes loose...

24:28.334 --> 24:29.936
I didn't just kill a bad cop.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.704
I shot the only guy
on the planet

24:31.704 --> 24:34.807
who can definitely tell us
who our killer is.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.857
You scared me.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.391
Sorry.

24:52.391 --> 24:54.761
I was out

24:54.761 --> 24:56.663
most of the night.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.330
Stuff from my old job.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.568
When I finally got back here,
I couldn't get to sleep.

25:01.568 --> 25:05.404
I just kept thinking...

25:05.404 --> 25:07.607
thinking about you.

25:10.076 --> 25:13.112
Hey, I want you
to go to the doctor.

25:13.112 --> 25:17.216
But it has to be somebody who
knows about me-- about how I am.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.885
Hopefully have some kind
of sympathy

25:18.885 --> 25:20.987
for how difficult it can be.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.192
I don't think I get
what you're saying.

25:26.192 --> 25:32.298
I did a little research on that
medicine that you were taking.

25:32.298 --> 25:35.702
It's pretty common.

25:35.702 --> 25:38.104
A lot of people take it.

25:38.104 --> 25:43.576
The Web site says that... the
side effects are very minimal.

25:45.778 --> 25:49.616
And I... I started wondering

25:49.616 --> 25:53.986
what high school
would have been like for me

25:53.986 --> 25:57.824
if I had a drug like that,
people to talk to.

26:01.628 --> 26:04.363
What?

26:04.363 --> 26:07.399
(chuckles)

26:07.399 --> 26:09.101
I'm awake, right?

26:09.101 --> 26:14.607
Hey, I still think what you did
was incredibly reckless.

26:14.607 --> 26:17.977
Hey. Incredibly dangerous.

26:17.977 --> 26:19.846
You can never do that again.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.717
And part of me
cannot even believe

26:24.717 --> 26:26.853
that we're having
this conversation.

26:29.656 --> 26:33.225
But Daddy and I talked.

26:33.225 --> 26:38.164
And... if the doctor
thinks that medication

26:38.164 --> 26:41.000
will improve the quality
of your life...

26:41.000 --> 26:45.304
Mom, can I ask
you something?

26:45.304 --> 26:47.640
If you can't get me
an appointment right away,

26:47.640 --> 26:49.976
can I just use the rest
of Ashley's pills

26:49.976 --> 26:51.310
just to get me through the test?

26:51.310 --> 26:55.648
No. Honey, we promised
we would give those pills

26:55.648 --> 26:57.784
back to Ashley's parents.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.218
And until a doctor tells us

26:59.218 --> 27:03.389
that there's a medicine
that makes sense for you...

27:03.389 --> 27:08.661
But I promise that I will try
to get that appointment

27:08.661 --> 27:12.064
as soon as possible.

27:12.064 --> 27:16.468
And until then, well,
I'm a good listener.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.171
(knocking on door)

27:31.183 --> 27:34.420
LYDECKER:
When did you realize
he was my son?

27:36.522 --> 27:39.391
Caitlyn told me.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.465
Why do you look so frightened?

27:46.465 --> 27:48.534
Do I look frightened?

27:48.534 --> 27:52.238
Yes, you look terrified.

27:52.238 --> 27:55.174
And why are you standing
by the door?

27:55.174 --> 27:58.878
Come into the room.
Have a seat.

28:05.952 --> 28:08.554
I went to see Justin yesterday.

28:08.554 --> 28:11.190
I told him I had some concerns
about his lifestyle.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.927
It's nothing I haven't said
to him before.

28:14.927 --> 28:17.096
Usually he ignores me.

28:17.096 --> 28:19.565
But this time he insisted
that I was wrong.

28:19.565 --> 28:22.268
Says that he's finally ready
to become a grown-up.

28:22.268 --> 28:28.674
Take some responsibility
for his life... his work.

28:28.674 --> 28:30.877
I was wondering if you'd mind

28:30.877 --> 28:33.379
meeting with him.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.882
I'd be very curious
to hear your impressions.

28:35.882 --> 28:38.117
See if you think
that he has actually

28:38.117 --> 28:39.618
turned a corner in his life.

28:39.618 --> 28:44.456
(ballpoint pen clicking)

28:47.559 --> 28:49.561
So, this is exciting.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.064
I'm one of the first people
in the company

28:52.064 --> 28:54.200
to get a look
at my dad's new toy.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.401
(chuckles)

28:55.401 --> 28:57.837
I don't think your father
thinks of me as a toy.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.138
No, I know.

28:59.138 --> 29:02.008
But you should realize
that you are now officially

29:02.008 --> 29:06.512
topic #1 around the water cooler
here at Lydecker.

29:06.512 --> 29:10.649
Everybody knows you do the same
thing that Caitlyn does,

29:10.649 --> 29:13.552
and honestly, I think
they're a little surprised

29:13.552 --> 29:17.456
that my dad would bring in
another six-figure napper.

29:17.456 --> 29:22.829
There's far more to my job
than taking naps.

29:22.829 --> 29:26.365
Your father is interested in my
impressions of things... people,

29:26.365 --> 29:29.235
which is why I think he wanted
me to sit down with you.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.503
Yeah. That's what I figured.

29:31.503 --> 29:32.839
He wants you to tell him

29:32.839 --> 29:34.640
if his only son
is permanently screwed up

29:34.640 --> 29:37.076
or if I can be... salvaged.

29:37.076 --> 29:40.012
That's not exactly
the way he put it.

29:40.012 --> 29:43.182
No, but that is what
he wants to know.

29:43.182 --> 29:46.385
And honestly, I can't
really blame him.

29:46.385 --> 29:50.422
I've spent most of the last
decade disappointing the man.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.125
DUIs, assault charges,

29:53.125 --> 29:55.027
all those stints in rehab.

29:55.027 --> 29:56.495
I mean, it's... (chuckles)

29:56.495 --> 29:58.865
it's hardly a secret
that I've been a total disaster

29:58.865 --> 30:00.099
for a long time.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.035
(clicking pen)

30:05.437 --> 30:10.042
Look, I know
that my dad doesn't trust me.

30:10.042 --> 30:12.778
I can't blame him.

30:12.778 --> 30:15.181
But I'm 26 years old,

30:15.181 --> 30:17.583
and my greatest accomplishment
in life

30:17.583 --> 30:19.485
is-is sleeping with a girl

30:19.485 --> 30:22.421
who came in second place
on a reality show.

30:25.191 --> 30:29.996
I guess I'm just tired
of being a joke.

30:29.996 --> 30:33.866
And all that dark stuff
is in the past.

30:33.866 --> 30:37.669
(sighs):
And I want to change.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.371
I have changed.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.173
(clicking pen)

30:41.173 --> 30:44.610
(clicking echoing)

30:52.919 --> 30:55.387
(sobbing)

31:08.367 --> 31:10.536
Look, I have
to be honest with you.

31:10.536 --> 31:13.239
I don't really believe
in what you do.

31:13.239 --> 31:16.508
But I know that my dad does.

31:16.508 --> 31:19.278
So please,

31:19.278 --> 31:21.747
I'd really appreciate it
if you'd tell him

31:21.747 --> 31:24.984
that his prodigal son
is doing just fine.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.489
Suicide?

31:30.489 --> 31:34.693
I kept leaving messages
for Mr. Lydecker,

31:34.693 --> 31:36.195
explaining that
it was urgent.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.830
He never called back.
Then I tried to tell Caitlyn,

31:38.830 --> 31:42.001
but she was with him
behind closed doors.

31:45.071 --> 31:48.007
I just feel like crying.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.542
I mean, that boy...

31:50.542 --> 31:55.414
That boy must have had every
possible advantage in life.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.517
And even with that,
he's so unhappy.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.753
He's ready to stick a gun in
his mouth and pull the trigger.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.690
Wow.

32:04.690 --> 32:07.126
How does that happen?

32:07.126 --> 32:10.929
I don't know. I've been
asking myself that for hours.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.232
What didn't he get?

32:13.232 --> 32:15.534
What didn't
his father give him?

32:15.534 --> 32:16.835
Time, maybe?

32:16.835 --> 32:21.573
Was he too busy building
an empire to be a good father?

32:21.573 --> 32:23.509
And the punch line is...

32:25.644 --> 32:29.181
I come home from work
and I miss dinner again

32:29.181 --> 32:31.383
and my girls
are already asleep.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.652
Oh, come on. I don't think
it's the same thing.

32:33.652 --> 32:37.089
Are you sure?
Yeah.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.992
I hope you're right.

32:39.992 --> 32:43.395
WOMAN:
Take one test booklet
and pass the others back.

32:44.696 --> 32:50.202
You will have 25 minutes
for part one of the exam.

32:50.202 --> 32:51.403
Before you begin,

32:51.403 --> 32:55.407
be sure to complete the personal
information in section A.

32:55.407 --> 32:58.310
Please be sure that you fill in
all of the ovals completely.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.980
You should be using a #2 pencil.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.783
If your pencil breaks,
I have extras here at my desk.

33:04.783 --> 33:07.386
Please raise your hand
and you may come up to get one.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.361
Eyes on your own paper, please.

33:19.865 --> 33:23.569
Abraham Lincoln was
America's greatest president.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.237
Check your spelling
on "president."

33:25.237 --> 33:27.239
I think you've got
a couple of extra Es

33:27.239 --> 33:28.207
kicking around in there.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.176
Okay, Daddy.

33:30.176 --> 33:32.244
Lincoln's mother
died in infancy.

33:32.244 --> 33:36.382
And he was born in a log cabin,
which he built.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.617
You might want
to check your facts on that.

33:38.617 --> 33:41.320
If Lincoln's mom died
when she was an infant,

33:41.320 --> 33:42.388
there would be no Lincoln.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.323
Nope. I think
you're wrong about that.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.791
That's what our teacher told us.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.759
Yeah, I heard that, too.

33:47.759 --> 33:49.928
ARIEL:
Uh, Dad?

33:49.928 --> 33:51.263
Hmm?
Where's Mom?

33:51.263 --> 33:52.964
Uh, I don't know, sweetie.

33:52.964 --> 33:54.533
She had to go in
extra early today.

33:56.302 --> 33:58.170
Is something wrong?

33:58.170 --> 33:59.338
Do you think there's any way

33:59.338 --> 34:01.907
that you could get me in
to see the doctor today?

34:01.907 --> 34:03.275
Today?

34:03.275 --> 34:04.543
Uh, I don't think so, honey.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.745
Um, the doctor that Mom has
in mind is out of town

34:06.745 --> 34:08.813
till the end of the week.
Why? What's going on?

34:08.813 --> 34:12.217
Just... I had this dream,
this crazy dream.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.786
Okay. Well, you know,

34:14.786 --> 34:17.322
bad dreams are really your
mom's area of expertise.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.791
But, uh...
It's okay.
It's probably nothing.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.060
It's not like it even made
a lot of sense.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.728
I just...
I was taking the PSATs,

34:23.728 --> 34:26.498
and I was in a classroom
that I'd never been in before,

34:26.498 --> 34:28.467
and the teacher
was giving the exam.

34:28.467 --> 34:31.536
I'd never seen her,
either, and...

34:31.536 --> 34:34.005
It's, uh, it's probably nothing.

34:34.005 --> 34:36.408
Are you sure? Because maybe
I could reach Mom on the phone.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.842
We could figure something out.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.978
No, it's okay.

34:39.978 --> 34:42.114
Thanks.

34:42.981 --> 34:44.815
(bell ringing)

34:44.815 --> 34:46.717
Did you hear?
What?

34:46.717 --> 34:48.754
Okay, apparently, Mr. Rutherford
has some radical stomach virus.

34:48.754 --> 34:52.123
There's a note on the door
that we have to go to some room

34:52.123 --> 34:54.626
in the auxiliary building
for second period.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.498
Oh, my God.

34:59.498 --> 35:00.632
What?

35:00.632 --> 35:03.435
There's something familiar
about this room.

35:03.435 --> 35:07.273
WOMAN:
Okay. Everyone,
let's settle down.

35:13.445 --> 35:16.215
Please.
Take a seat.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.220
As most of you
probably already know,

35:21.220 --> 35:22.821
Mr. Rutherford went home sick.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.390
My name is Ms. Snowden.

35:24.390 --> 35:26.725
I'll be your teacher until
he gets back on his feet.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.960
REPORTER (on TV):
Authorities continue
to investigate

35:28.960 --> 35:30.429
a possible connection

35:30.429 --> 35:32.998
between slain police detective
Brad Auerbach

35:32.998 --> 35:36.402
and the recent string of serial
killings in the Phoenix area.

35:36.402 --> 35:39.037
So far, they're refusing
to confirm whether they consider

35:39.037 --> 35:41.573
Auerbach a suspect
or just person of interest

35:41.573 --> 35:42.974
in this case...
(TV shuts off)

35:42.974 --> 35:44.142
Mr. Lydecker?

35:44.142 --> 35:46.612
I'm sorry. Your assistant
told me to come right in.

35:49.948 --> 35:52.651
Thank you.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.422
You left me a number
of urgent messages.

35:56.422 --> 36:00.426
Sir, I'm concerned
about your son.

36:00.426 --> 36:03.662
I sense that he's in
a real moment of crisis.

36:03.662 --> 36:07.165
He's consumed by
a profound sense of despair.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.367
And I'm fairly certain

36:08.367 --> 36:09.968
he's going to attempt
to hurt himself.

36:09.968 --> 36:13.372
I appreciate your concern.

36:13.372 --> 36:16.275
And I've sensed
the same thing myself.

36:16.275 --> 36:18.544
Now, rest assured,
he's being watched.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.948
I've reached out to a number
of mental health professionals.

36:24.483 --> 36:28.520
Truth be told, at this moment,
I am less concerned

36:28.520 --> 36:30.556
about Justin's well-being
than I am with yours.

36:32.891 --> 36:36.995
Caitlyn and I have been
reviewing your log,

36:36.995 --> 36:39.465
your dreams,

36:39.465 --> 36:40.599
your impressions.

36:42.434 --> 36:45.103
I fear we may have
a problem, Allison.

36:45.103 --> 36:46.805
Really? I'm sorry. I...

36:46.805 --> 36:48.173
The dreams you've
been having

36:48.173 --> 36:50.442
about this, uh,
this police detective...

36:50.442 --> 36:52.511
the one who just died,
the one that you believe

36:52.511 --> 36:54.413
is connected
to this recent spate of murders?

36:54.413 --> 36:55.781
Can I ask you about those?

36:55.781 --> 36:57.215
Please.

36:57.215 --> 37:00.919
The fact that he was slain
by a former colleague of yours

37:00.919 --> 37:02.187
the night after

37:02.187 --> 37:03.889
you dreamed that
he was connected

37:03.889 --> 37:06.892
to this horrible string
of murders...

37:06.892 --> 37:08.894
I suspect that
that's not a coincidence.

37:08.894 --> 37:12.631
I'm not following
where you're going...

37:12.631 --> 37:14.466
Did you mention your dreams
to your colleague?

37:16.635 --> 37:18.370
Yes, I did.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.376
All right, well, I understand
that you're new here.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.278
I understand that you're...

37:26.278 --> 37:28.113
you are still finding
your footing.

37:28.113 --> 37:32.884
But I need to be completely
clear about one thing.

37:34.486 --> 37:39.024
We are paying you
an extremely large sum of money.

37:40.926 --> 37:46.298
Your thoughts, your dreams,
your impressions...

37:46.298 --> 37:47.833
they belong to Lydecker now.

37:49.167 --> 37:50.569
They are actually

37:50.569 --> 37:53.271
the intellectual property
of this company,

37:53.271 --> 37:54.840
so any attempt

37:54.840 --> 37:57.976
on your part to share
those thoughts, those dreams,

37:57.976 --> 38:00.078
those impressions, with anyone
outside of this company

38:00.078 --> 38:03.782
would actually constitute
an act of theft.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.253
And I would hate to have
to prosecute you.

38:08.253 --> 38:11.623
Sir, I take your point, but the
dreams that we're talking about

38:11.623 --> 38:13.058
have nothing to do
with Lydecker,

38:13.058 --> 38:15.961
and everything to do with
an open police investigation

38:15.961 --> 38:19.097
in which lives clearly
hang in the balance.

38:19.097 --> 38:22.100
Certainly, you can appreciate
that distinction.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.201
Yeah, of course I do.

38:23.201 --> 38:27.806
And I do appreciate your sense
of civic responsibility.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.975
However...

38:29.975 --> 38:33.712
if you ever breach
your contract again,

38:33.712 --> 38:38.584
if you ever breach
my confidence again,

38:38.584 --> 38:40.419
I will litigate you with a vigor

38:40.419 --> 38:44.490
unlike anything you have ever
experienced in your life.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.092
I will see to it

38:47.092 --> 38:49.661
that between the cost
of defending yourself

38:49.661 --> 38:52.130
and the time it takes
to mount that defense,

38:52.130 --> 38:55.534
both you and your husband
will be absolutely penniless.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.802
Your house will be gone.

38:56.802 --> 39:00.071
Your children
will have no futures.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.909
Don't misunderstand,
Allison.

39:03.909 --> 39:06.978
It's my expectation
that you will work here

39:06.978 --> 39:09.548
for a very long time.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.049
Maybe the rest of your life.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.084
I want you to be happy.

39:16.087 --> 39:19.425
I want us both to be happy.

39:22.461 --> 39:25.697
REPORTER (on TV):
Clear skies tonight
with a low near 70.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.566
Increasing cloudiness tomorrow.

39:27.566 --> 39:30.068
Sticky and humid
with a high of 96.

39:39.411 --> 39:41.447
How long are you going
to sit out here?

39:41.447 --> 39:43.148
Till I make sense of it.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.551
I'll get you some blankets
and a pillow.

39:45.551 --> 39:48.587
How can you be so sanguine
about this?

39:48.587 --> 39:51.122
Those dreams that I was sharing
with the authorities

39:51.122 --> 39:52.458
had nothing to do with Lydecker.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.925
I know that.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.194
All right. Then you tell me
how the company is affected

39:56.194 --> 39:58.597
if I help the police catch
whoever is killing these women.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.899
I can't.
I don't think it would be.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.100
Exactly.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.603
Mr. Lydecker treated me like
I was some kind of traitor.

40:04.603 --> 40:07.539
Like I was sharing secrets
with his biggest competitor.

40:07.539 --> 40:08.640
I started to think

40:08.640 --> 40:10.609
that he was going to fire me
right then and there.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.943
Well, he could have.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.079
I mean, you did violate
the terms of your contract.

40:14.079 --> 40:17.583
Excuse me
to help stop a murderer.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.084
But that's not his concern.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.419
That's not the business
that he's in.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.389
Look, is this guy going to be
named citizen of the year?

40:24.389 --> 40:26.091
No.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.393
But... hold on a sec.
Don't jump down my throat here.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.061
He does have kind of a point.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.498
Your ideas, your thoughts
are one of the things

40:32.498 --> 40:33.799
that he's paying for.

40:33.799 --> 40:36.001
It was the same thing
when I worked at Aerodytech.

40:36.001 --> 40:38.269
Everything that I thought up
belonged to them.

40:38.269 --> 40:41.372
Now, you want to talk
cosmic right and wrong?

40:41.372 --> 40:43.775
Yeah, you did a good thing
by calling Scanlon.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.511
And that's to your credit.

40:45.511 --> 40:46.745
But let's just say that I...

40:46.745 --> 40:49.314
I dreamed up an idea
where I could solve

40:49.314 --> 40:51.950
all the world's energy problems
while I was at Aerodytech

40:51.950 --> 40:53.652
and I brought it
straight to the UN.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.587
Do you think
that my employers

40:55.587 --> 40:57.088
would have patted
me on the back,

40:57.088 --> 41:00.125
or do you think they would have
sued me for everything I had?

41:00.125 --> 41:02.528
Doesn't make sense.
None of this makes sense.

41:02.528 --> 41:05.430
Yeah, well, welcome
to corporate America.

41:05.430 --> 41:07.733
(gun cocking)

41:29.387 --> 41:32.023
(sobbing)

41:36.094 --> 41:38.129
Oh, God.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.931
Oh, God...

41:39.931 --> 41:41.867
Oh, God.

42:04.522 --> 42:08.126
(phone keypad beeping)

42:20.171 --> 42:22.407
Justin.

42:22.407 --> 42:24.342
Oh, my God, it was Justin.
