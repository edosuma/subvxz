WEBVTT

01:47.066 --> 01:48.667
Oh, Jesus.

01:48.701 --> 01:50.612
Why are we ruining this
Christmas with this shit?

01:50.636 --> 01:53.705
I love this song.
It's cute. It's Christmasy.

01:53.739 --> 01:57.075
For fallen off
the fucking wagon?

01:57.109 --> 01:58.543
Bit unfair.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.512
You'd have to be pissed
to stomach this.

02:00.546 --> 02:02.724
Yeah, well, you know, I've got
to stomach a lot more sober,

02:02.748 --> 02:04.749
including your old
schoolmates, trust me.

02:39.151 --> 02:41.619
Thank fuck we don't
have to wear these ghastly

02:41.653 --> 02:42.787
Christmas jumpers again.

02:42.821 --> 02:44.422
Oh, what a shame.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.867
Thought we all looked
rather splendid.

02:45.891 --> 02:48.893
Oh, of course you did, darling.

02:48.927 --> 02:52.797
How's our little
Sleeping Beauty?

02:56.702 --> 02:59.604
Oh, Prince Charming.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.974
Thank you, darling.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.576
Mwah.

03:14.953 --> 03:17.689
Darling, Nell adores you.

03:17.723 --> 03:20.592
Well, last year,
she sat me at the kid's table.

03:20.626 --> 03:22.961
I'm so sorry.

03:28.467 --> 03:30.135
We don't have to go.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.936
We could go anywhere.

03:31.970 --> 03:35.540
We could turn around,
just you and me.

03:35.574 --> 03:39.177
Oh, sweetheart, I love you.

03:39.211 --> 03:41.813
But Nell's like a sister to me.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.949
I couldn't abandon them
this Christmas.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.564
Ooh, shit, fuck, oh, fuck!

03:59.598 --> 04:00.899
Fly!

04:04.870 --> 04:07.005
Fuck!

04:07.039 --> 04:09.140
Fuck!

04:16.781 --> 04:19.517
God, I love Christmas songs.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.520
You know you know it!
You know it! Just sing it!

04:28.694 --> 04:30.228
- Mom!
- Yeah?

04:30.262 --> 04:33.031
I've cut myself, Mom. Fuck!

04:33.065 --> 04:34.699
I'm coming!

04:50.949 --> 04:53.084
I'm coming, I'm coming.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.519
Did you find a plaster?

04:54.553 --> 04:56.821
No.

04:56.855 --> 04:58.957
Did you bleed on the carrots?

04:58.991 --> 05:01.826
Really, Mom?

05:01.860 --> 05:02.894
Will I die?

05:02.928 --> 05:04.696
Yeah, probably.

05:04.730 --> 05:06.731
Give it.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.800
- Oh, Mom!
- Oh, you'll be fine.

05:08.834 --> 05:10.101
Did you rinse them first?

05:10.135 --> 05:11.636
Yep, and the parsnips.

05:11.670 --> 05:13.938
- Where are your brothers.
- Uh, on the PlayStation.

05:13.972 --> 05:16.274
Bastards. They're supposed
to be in the bath.

05:16.309 --> 05:18.243
We haven't got long, Mom.

05:18.278 --> 05:20.211
I know, darling.

05:20.245 --> 05:21.880
They'll be here soon.

05:21.914 --> 05:25.216
Oh, shit, I'm not
a fucking waitress.

05:25.250 --> 05:26.918
Belinda's still in there.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.920
She won't bloody leave.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.255
Haven't made enough.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.557
You sure your mother
wants them let out?

05:32.591 --> 05:34.893
She thinks it's kinder if the
foxes get them first.

05:34.927 --> 05:36.995
- Yeah, maybe.
- You promised you'd let me

05:37.029 --> 05:38.763
light the fireworks later.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.732
Yes, I said I would.

05:40.766 --> 05:42.267
You look great.

05:42.302 --> 05:44.603
Ooh, ooh.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.005
D...

05:48.941 --> 05:50.542
Oh, shit, where are the boys?

05:50.576 --> 05:52.043
Uh, on PlayStation.

05:52.077 --> 05:53.745
Bastards.

05:54.314 --> 05:56.848
- I could...
- Boys! Bath!

05:59.117 --> 06:01.586
You look perfect.

06:04.222 --> 06:06.124
I don't hear a lot of movement!

06:11.663 --> 06:14.165
Come on, Belinda.
Be free and be brave.

06:21.307 --> 06:24.943
Oh, and remember no TV, okay?

06:24.977 --> 06:28.280
And no iPhones, no Googling,
and, for the love of God,

06:28.314 --> 06:29.991
no arguing with Kitty.
I think she's annoying

06:30.015 --> 06:31.749
but just make an effort,
all right?

06:31.783 --> 06:33.885
- She's a pain in the ass, Dad.
- Language, Thomas.

06:33.919 --> 06:35.119
You said we could.

06:35.153 --> 06:36.654
Yeah, I know,
but there's now need

06:36.688 --> 06:38.189
to get carried away, chaps.
Come on.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.258
Is Kitty allowed to swear?

06:40.293 --> 06:41.793
Probably.

06:41.827 --> 06:43.362
You said everyone
was allowed to swear.

06:43.396 --> 06:44.829
Yeah, I did.

06:46.898 --> 06:50.268
Oh, Jesus, they're early.

06:50.303 --> 06:51.970
This is important.

06:52.004 --> 06:54.706
Don't drown. How do I look good?

06:54.740 --> 06:55.840
- Good.
- Good.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.376
That's why I love you.

06:57.410 --> 07:00.312
Right, it's not time
for a soak, so hurry up, chaps.

07:14.126 --> 07:16.628
Oh, fuck. Sing to me.

07:16.662 --> 07:18.597
Yes, darling?

07:20.732 --> 07:22.133
They're beautiful. Thank you.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.911
Sandra picked them from
the neighbor's garden.

07:23.935 --> 07:25.337
It didn't take her very long.

07:25.371 --> 07:26.771
Oh, okay, lovely.

07:26.805 --> 07:28.973
- Ah, Kitty.
- Is the sticky toffee

07:29.007 --> 07:31.075
pudding ready?

07:31.109 --> 07:34.279
Sandra promised that there
would be sticky toffee pudding.

07:34.313 --> 07:35.381
Yes, absolutely.

07:35.415 --> 07:37.383
Where's Art?

07:37.417 --> 07:39.217
Uh...

07:39.251 --> 07:40.818
♪ Da-da-da-da-da-da ♪

07:40.852 --> 07:42.020
Wow.

07:42.054 --> 07:43.821
Kitty's university fund.

07:43.855 --> 07:45.823
Oh, why didn't I think of that?

07:45.857 --> 07:47.225
You did saved me your old room?

07:47.259 --> 07:49.260
Fucking sticky toffee pudding,
I forgot.

07:49.295 --> 07:50.995
- Oh, no, fuck.
- Sorry.

07:51.029 --> 07:54.065
She's gonna kill me. Tony!

07:54.099 --> 07:56.100
Tony?

07:56.134 --> 07:59.270
- Tony.
- Yes, mother?

07:59.305 --> 08:01.773
Nell forgot toffee.

08:01.807 --> 08:03.107
- Oh, crumbs.
- What?

08:03.141 --> 08:05.411
Kidding. Your mom's kidding.
Come on.

08:05.445 --> 08:06.844
Let's find Art.

08:06.878 --> 08:08.246
Go to the garage, darling.

08:08.281 --> 08:10.948
There's a Tesco drive-in
right down the road.

08:10.982 --> 08:12.250
What if it's shut?

08:12.285 --> 08:13.885
Find a mallet.
Break a fucking window!

08:13.919 --> 08:15.421
- I don't know.
- I suppose so.

08:15.455 --> 08:17.322
- Simon, have you got a mallet?
- What?

08:17.356 --> 08:19.358
Simon?

08:19.392 --> 08:20.959
Art?

08:25.465 --> 08:27.699
Art?

08:28.734 --> 08:30.268
You need a hand, darling?

08:30.303 --> 08:32.203
Um, yeah, actually.

08:32.236 --> 08:35.139
If you could just
grab one and wait.

08:35.173 --> 08:36.274
All right.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.476
Oh!

08:37.510 --> 08:39.110
Mm!

08:40.379 --> 08:42.113
Oh.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.981
Darling.

08:44.015 --> 08:45.783
You look impossibly
beautiful as ever.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.319
Thank you, my love.

08:47.353 --> 08:51.356
Where's Sandra? I want room
before she nabs it.

08:51.390 --> 08:53.292
Oh.

08:53.326 --> 08:54.759
- What?!
- I know.

08:54.793 --> 08:55.860
- Oh.
- I know, I know.

08:55.894 --> 08:56.994
Oh, my God.

08:57.028 --> 08:58.930
Oh, Alex didn't have to pay.

08:58.964 --> 09:01.099
We had a rather regretful
exchange with an Arab lady

09:01.133 --> 09:03.167
and her surprisingly
fierce bodyguard.

09:03.201 --> 09:05.304
- Oh, happened?!
- Oh, yeah, Alex got caught

09:05.338 --> 09:06.305
in the crossfire.

09:06.339 --> 09:07.739
It was very un-PC of me,

09:07.773 --> 09:10.775
smacking a lady in a burqa.

09:10.809 --> 09:12.176
Does it hurt?

09:12.210 --> 09:14.011
Um, yeah, it does.

09:14.045 --> 09:15.780
Does it?

09:15.814 --> 09:17.416
- Why did you say something?
- I did.

09:17.450 --> 09:19.451
Oh, God. Is Kitty here?

09:19.485 --> 09:21.487
With a bow in her hair.

09:21.521 --> 09:23.988
Slightly hoping they'd
put her down already.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.524
Behave.

09:25.558 --> 09:27.436
Remember, tonight is
all about love and forgiveness.

09:27.460 --> 09:30.295
Oh, exciting.
Who are we forgiving?

09:30.329 --> 09:32.897
Ourselves, of course.

09:32.931 --> 09:34.999
Oh, yeah.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.902
Oh, thank you
for coming, sweetheart.

09:37.936 --> 09:39.914
I don't know what we would
have done without Bella.

09:39.938 --> 09:41.340
Mind you, she's very naughty.

09:41.374 --> 09:43.808
She should have
stolen something for you, too.

09:46.512 --> 09:48.347
Art?

09:56.289 --> 09:57.822
- Hi.
- What the fuck?

09:57.856 --> 09:59.324
Get the fuck out, Kitty.

09:59.358 --> 10:01.460
Nope. I want to watch.

10:01.494 --> 10:04.463
My mother said since tonight is
a special occasion,

10:04.497 --> 10:06.465
you have to be
especially nice to me.

10:06.499 --> 10:09.167
- No fucking way.
- Swearing is common.

10:09.201 --> 10:12.371
- Out mom swears.
- Exactly.

10:12.405 --> 10:14.071
- What's going on?
- They made me.

10:14.105 --> 10:15.541
- No, we didn't.
- No, we didn't.

10:15.575 --> 10:17.875
Shut the fuck up, Kitty.
We all know you're full of shit.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.511
- Excuse me?
- I said shut the fuck up.

10:19.545 --> 10:22.080
Mum!

10:28.454 --> 10:30.888
Are you coping, darling? Yes?

10:30.922 --> 10:32.957
Yeah, just.

10:32.991 --> 10:34.225
The boys upset?

10:34.259 --> 10:35.827
Uh, well, they will be

10:35.861 --> 10:37.406
when they see
I don't have enough potatoes.

10:37.430 --> 10:38.963
You're worried about potatoes?

10:38.997 --> 10:42.501
Yes. Waitrose was empty,
and James eats a lot.

10:42.535 --> 10:44.836
Well, Sophie doesn't.

10:44.870 --> 10:46.103
God, how's she do it?

10:46.137 --> 10:47.539
Remember how hard we tried?

10:47.573 --> 10:49.207
Coke helped,
and then the kids came.

10:49.241 --> 10:50.609
It was kids or coke.

10:50.643 --> 10:52.243
You wanted to be anorexic?

10:52.278 --> 10:55.847
She looked great.
You looked great.

10:55.881 --> 10:58.082
Sandra wants me
to apologize to Kitty.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.551
Did you call her a cunt?

10:59.585 --> 11:01.195
Because we said that
that word was out of bounds.

11:01.219 --> 11:02.354
You should have done.

11:02.388 --> 11:05.056
Art! Apologize.

11:05.090 --> 11:08.159
It's Christmas, darling.
What would baby Jesus say?

11:09.662 --> 11:11.463
You're joking, right?

11:19.438 --> 11:20.905
Sorry, Kitty.

11:20.939 --> 11:22.608
Good boy, Art.
You're such a good boy.

11:22.642 --> 11:24.276
You just called me an asshole.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.244
Well, you can be.

11:28.314 --> 11:29.981
- What, I...
- Sorry.

11:30.015 --> 11:34.151
All right, all right, come on,
piss off, piss off.

11:34.185 --> 11:35.654
That doesn't mean you won, okay?

11:35.688 --> 11:38.923
Just little stripper.
Look at this.

11:38.957 --> 11:40.559
Oh, I took Nell's room.

11:40.593 --> 11:43.027
You don't mind, do you?

11:43.061 --> 11:44.463
Fine.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.443
Oh, can I have
sparkling water, please?

11:48.467 --> 11:51.437
Oh, shit, yes, sorry.
Of course. Um...

11:56.609 --> 11:58.344
Fanta.

12:00.446 --> 12:02.079
You like Fanta, darling.

12:02.113 --> 12:04.181
Do I?

12:04.215 --> 12:07.352
I'm so sorry. All of the water
was gone, even the shit stuff.

12:07.386 --> 12:09.455
Did Lizzy call?

12:11.357 --> 12:13.925
I thought Lizzy was coming.

12:13.959 --> 12:15.560
Bella, you said Lizzy
was coming.

12:15.594 --> 12:18.029
Bella?

12:19.632 --> 12:21.433
- Did you invite her?
- Did you?

12:21.467 --> 12:25.002
Yes, I said,
"Don't forget to call Lizzy."

12:25.036 --> 12:27.606
No, no, you did not.
You said you would call Lizzy.

12:27.640 --> 12:32.143
Why would I call her?
I don't like her.

12:32.177 --> 12:34.546
Don't you?

12:34.580 --> 12:36.080
I've never liked her.

12:36.114 --> 12:37.516
No, she hasn't.

12:37.550 --> 12:39.951
Doesn't mean I want her
to be alone, though,

12:39.985 --> 12:41.453
Fuck.

12:41.487 --> 12:43.355
I would have put up with her.

12:43.389 --> 12:44.723
I really like Lizzy.

12:44.757 --> 12:47.659
And that is why I love you,
darling.

12:47.693 --> 12:51.430
Always so generous.

12:51.464 --> 12:53.998
Every inch of you, generous.

12:56.201 --> 12:58.069
Do you guys have a lot of sex?

12:58.103 --> 13:01.005
Yeah, loads. Fucking loads,

13:01.039 --> 13:02.341
Don't we?

13:02.375 --> 13:05.444
- Exhausting.
- God, exhausting.

13:11.216 --> 13:13.217
- Just give me one sec.
- You sure?

13:13.251 --> 13:14.453
I'll meet you in there, yeah.

13:14.487 --> 13:16.253
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Just one second.

13:16.288 --> 13:18.122
Okay.

13:22.193 --> 13:23.428
Nell!

13:23.462 --> 13:26.263
- Oh, James!
- Smells gorgeous in here.

13:26.298 --> 13:28.333
- Oh, thank you.
- You look amazing.

13:28.367 --> 13:31.235
Do I? I don't look old?
God, we're all getting old.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.537
We were getting old.

13:34.039 --> 13:35.272
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Sophie!

13:35.307 --> 13:37.642
I didn't see you.
Oh, let me take this.

13:37.676 --> 13:39.511
God, come in.
You must be freezing.

13:39.545 --> 13:41.780
Why? Oh, don't bother.

13:41.814 --> 13:44.015
James told me you all
think I'm anorexic.

13:44.049 --> 13:47.151
- James, no we don't!
- Yes, we do, darling.

13:47.185 --> 13:48.353
Hi, Sandra.

13:48.387 --> 13:50.622
Oh. How old are you again?

13:50.656 --> 13:52.491
You asked me that last time.

13:52.525 --> 13:55.159
- Oh, did I?
- Yes.

13:55.193 --> 13:57.529
- Ah!
- Sandra.

14:02.067 --> 14:03.702
Charming.

14:03.736 --> 14:05.704
Uh, let him go, sweetheart.

14:05.738 --> 14:07.606
Oh, do I have to?

14:07.640 --> 14:10.241
Uh, is Kitty here?

14:10.276 --> 14:13.312
Of course. She couldn't exactly
leave her at home, could she?

14:14.280 --> 14:16.180
- No.
- No.

14:16.214 --> 14:17.582
No, no, of course not,

14:17.616 --> 14:19.518
especially because
we made a pact.

14:19.552 --> 14:23.722
- I didn't make a pact.
- Oh, we did.

14:23.756 --> 14:26.591
Uh, tonight is all
about truth and love.

14:26.625 --> 14:28.259
And, you know,
you're with James,

14:28.294 --> 14:30.295
so that counts as making
a pact, right, darling?

14:30.329 --> 14:33.064
Fuck. Where's Lizzy?

14:47.646 --> 14:49.815
Come on, pooch.

14:49.849 --> 14:51.516
We make tremendous criminals.

14:51.550 --> 14:53.452
That felt so bloody good.

14:53.486 --> 14:55.420
- Tony? Tony?
- Yes, my love?

14:55.454 --> 14:58.089
Oh, you got them. Excellent!
Well done!

14:58.123 --> 15:01.326
Pass them over.
James and Sophie are fighting.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.471
James and Sophie are fighting.

15:02.495 --> 15:04.162
Ooh.

15:04.730 --> 15:07.432
You haven't.
You haven't told them?

15:07.466 --> 15:09.868
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:09.902 --> 15:11.303
Shh.

15:11.337 --> 15:13.204
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

15:13.238 --> 15:15.272
How old is she again?

15:15.307 --> 15:17.375
- 15.
- She can't be 15.

15:17.409 --> 15:19.544
Okay, 20.

15:19.578 --> 15:21.346
How am I supposed to feel?

15:21.380 --> 15:23.648
Are you ashamed?

15:23.682 --> 15:26.217
Why would I be ashamed?

15:26.251 --> 15:28.753
- Is it like a posh thing?
- What? No.

15:28.787 --> 15:30.889
I've just noticed posh people
like to keep secrets.

15:30.923 --> 15:34.225
It's... it's depressing.

15:34.259 --> 15:35.527
It's depressing?

15:35.561 --> 15:38.530
I mean, it's painful for them.

15:38.564 --> 15:40.832
They don't have a choice,
Sophie.

15:40.866 --> 15:42.567
- Yes, they do.
- They don't.

15:42.601 --> 15:44.135
Well, they do.

15:44.169 --> 15:46.304
They don't,
and they wouldn't understand.

15:46.338 --> 15:48.206
What wouldn't we understand?

15:50.376 --> 15:52.209
Trivial pursuits.

15:52.243 --> 15:55.480
You are unbelievably bad
at the geography questions.

15:55.514 --> 15:57.526
So I didn't bring it because
I didn't want to embarrass you.

15:57.550 --> 15:59.584
But I'm really fucking good.
At articulate.

15:59.618 --> 16:01.319
Alright, show me.

16:01.353 --> 16:02.931
- Salt and pepper?
- Ah, salt and pepper.

16:02.955 --> 16:05.222
Here, yes, and spoons, yes.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.593
And yeah, spoons.

16:10.563 --> 16:12.497
Thank you.

16:12.531 --> 16:14.367
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:18.437 --> 16:20.572
- Merry Christmas.
- Happy Christmas.

16:20.606 --> 16:24.442
At least we won't have to
play trivial pursuits, right?

16:24.476 --> 16:26.512
Oh, are we not?

17:19.498 --> 17:20.999
Oh, marvelous.

17:21.032 --> 17:25.403
It's just one potato each.
I'm really sorry.

17:25.436 --> 17:26.513
It's just one for everyone?

17:26.538 --> 17:28.406
Yes.

17:31.277 --> 17:32.577
What, so just half for the boys?

17:32.611 --> 17:33.955
There's one,
there's one for everyone.

17:33.979 --> 17:35.981
- They're half our size.
- One.

17:38.384 --> 17:39.918
Mm.

17:44.690 --> 17:47.492
Real crunchy.

17:48.327 --> 17:49.967
- Shall we say, Grace?
- What a good idea.

17:49.995 --> 17:51.563
- What a good idea.
- Yes!

17:51.597 --> 17:53.431
- Lovely, lovely.
- Good idea.

17:53.465 --> 17:54.967
Right.

17:55.501 --> 17:59.938
- Simon?
- Sure. Um...

17:59.972 --> 18:01.773
Where to start? Uh...

18:01.807 --> 18:02.974
God.

18:03.008 --> 18:05.677
God, yes, dear God.

18:05.711 --> 18:09.648
May we thank you
for my wife's culinary talents?

18:09.682 --> 18:11.049
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

18:11.083 --> 18:14.720
Also an important, uh...

18:15.988 --> 18:18.923
Um...

18:18.957 --> 18:20.625
For our beautiful friends,

18:20.659 --> 18:22.727
Yes.

18:22.761 --> 18:25.330
For our beautiful children.

18:25.364 --> 18:27.666
And for the food on our table,

18:27.700 --> 18:30.935
for the lives that we've shared.

18:30.969 --> 18:33.772
For...

18:33.806 --> 18:36.708
Oh, for, uh...

18:36.742 --> 18:38.777
the promise of love.

18:38.811 --> 18:40.412
And happiness.

18:40.446 --> 18:42.781
And health and safety,
health and safety.

18:42.815 --> 18:45.684
In your in your beautiful,
really beautiful...

18:45.718 --> 18:47.762
Fun! Let's not forget how fun
it's going to be up there.

18:47.786 --> 18:51.556
In your in your fun,
beautiful, safe...

18:51.590 --> 18:53.658
Kingdom. Amen.

18:53.692 --> 18:54.793
- Amen.
- Amen.

18:54.827 --> 18:56.027
- Amen.
- Amen!

18:56.061 --> 18:57.629
- Let's eat.
- Alright.

18:57.663 --> 19:00.799
- Crack on, everyone.
- Yummy.

19:03.135 --> 19:05.403
- I...
- Where is the gravy?

19:05.437 --> 19:09.107
- Here comes the gravy boat.
- Lovely.

19:12.578 --> 19:14.646
- Delicious, darling.
- Really lovely.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.014
- Terrific.
- Really, really good.

19:16.048 --> 19:17.582
Did anyone watch
the Queen's speech?

19:17.616 --> 19:19.060
- Didn't see it myself.
- Well, she's clearly

19:19.084 --> 19:20.752
in some bunker set up, you know?

19:20.786 --> 19:23.355
Filled with tins
of baked beans and dog food.

19:23.389 --> 19:25.790
- Oh.
- Absolutely.

19:25.824 --> 19:29.494
No. Who'd want to live in a hole
and eat dog food for 100 years?

19:29.528 --> 19:32.130
Dog food for
the, uh, dogs, darling.

19:32.164 --> 19:34.966
Oh. Sorry.

19:37.536 --> 19:39.804
Knock yourselves out, boys.

19:39.838 --> 19:42.474
I don't think she's in
a hole with dog food.

19:42.508 --> 19:43.948
I mean, I heard her.
She sounded sad.

19:43.976 --> 19:47.846
She's an old woman,
so it's fine.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.648
Excuse me?

19:51.049 --> 19:53.551
Who said it's fine
because she's old?

19:53.585 --> 19:54.929
Oh, come on, Sophie.
You know what she means.

19:54.953 --> 19:57.722
You mean that old people
don't matter

19:57.756 --> 20:00.425
because they've had their time,
so now they can die?

20:00.459 --> 20:04.162
Darling. What's going on?

20:04.196 --> 20:05.974
I just don't think we should
teach our children

20:05.998 --> 20:07.599
that old people don't matter.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.501
Our children.

20:09.535 --> 20:11.870
Maybe Kitty didn't
quite mean it...

20:11.904 --> 20:14.149
- Oh, you wouldn't understand.
- What wouldn't she understand?

20:14.173 --> 20:16.040
Well, you're not parents.

20:16.074 --> 20:18.042
Oh, of course, of course.
Sorry, I forgot.

20:18.076 --> 20:19.687
Darling, were psychopaths
because we've never

20:19.711 --> 20:21.479
- given birth.
- Of course you're not.

20:21.513 --> 20:23.515
Sandra, just...

20:23.549 --> 20:26.050
Let's just leave it.
Just leave it.

20:26.084 --> 20:28.052
I mean, how do we measure life

20:28.086 --> 20:29.821
and who's worth what?

20:29.855 --> 20:32.991
Well, I'm worth nothing.
Completely broke. Not a bean.

20:33.025 --> 20:36.661
Sorry, darling.
I know what you meant.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.830
Please, let's not fight.

20:38.864 --> 20:40.575
Especially not before
the sticky toffee pudding.

20:40.599 --> 20:42.534
Right, Kitty?

20:42.568 --> 20:44.436
Sorry, what is this all about?

20:44.470 --> 20:45.580
Did someone upset you, darling?

20:45.604 --> 20:47.172
Sorry, I'm sorry.

20:47.206 --> 20:50.775
Sophie had a difficult night
last night, didn't you, darling?

20:50.809 --> 20:54.679
- Tell us.
- Please don't, Sophie.

20:57.216 --> 20:59.451
It was horrible.

20:59.485 --> 21:01.152
How was it horrible?

21:01.186 --> 21:03.888
Darling, I don't think
right now is the time to share.

21:03.922 --> 21:05.824
We had dinner.

21:05.858 --> 21:08.927
We sang Celine Dion songs.

21:08.961 --> 21:13.765
And... and we danced to Britney.

21:13.799 --> 21:16.000
We laughed.

21:16.034 --> 21:20.004
And we cried and said
that we loved each other.

21:20.038 --> 21:21.783
- That sounds perfect.
- I wanted to be there

21:21.807 --> 21:24.976
and... and be
a witness for them.

21:25.010 --> 21:27.579
Maybe it sounds stupid,
but I wanted them to know

21:27.613 --> 21:28.980
- that... that...
- Yeah, okay.

21:29.014 --> 21:30.758
- Okay, well done, Sophie.
- Somebody that they loved

21:30.782 --> 21:33.151
- and trusted would witness...
- Very honorable.

21:33.185 --> 21:36.020
Uh, while I'm up,
I have an announcement,

21:36.054 --> 21:38.156
and that is for those that
have room,

21:38.190 --> 21:41.659
there is a delectable
cheese plate.

21:43.128 --> 21:45.230
But, uh also,
I think it's time for us

21:45.264 --> 21:48.467
to raise a glass to the chef.

21:50.002 --> 21:52.837
To my wife. Love of my life.

21:52.871 --> 21:54.939
- Nell!
- To Nell!

21:57.142 --> 21:59.944
- Merry Christmas.
- Cheers!

21:59.978 --> 22:02.614
I just think we should be honest
with the kids, that's all.

22:02.648 --> 22:04.249
Jesus Christ.

22:08.253 --> 22:12.223
Mum hasn't lied to us,
and we've seen the news.

22:12.257 --> 22:13.791
When?

22:13.825 --> 22:15.693
We know the Russians
want us all dead.

22:15.727 --> 22:18.006
They're sending poisonous gas
to kill us all in the morning.

22:18.030 --> 22:19.731
- The Russians?
- What?

22:19.765 --> 22:22.800
Yeah, they're obsessed
with world domination.

22:22.834 --> 22:25.103
Don't be ridiculous, Kitty.
It's not the Russians.

22:25.137 --> 22:27.805
- It's a planet, Kitty.
- It's very upset.

22:27.839 --> 22:29.707
Kitty, for years,
the planet's absorbed

22:29.741 --> 22:32.010
everyone's filthy rubbish,
and it's had enough.

22:32.044 --> 22:34.579
It can't take it anymore,
so it's spitting it back out

22:34.613 --> 22:36.047
as a "fuck you" to the world,

22:36.081 --> 22:38.116
- That's right, Kitty.
- We've taken the earth

22:38.150 --> 22:40.184
for granted, haven't we, Dad?

22:40.218 --> 22:41.920
Mm-hmm.

22:41.954 --> 22:43.988
Nonsense. It's
the Russians sending the gas.

22:44.022 --> 22:45.800
You can't always blame
the fucking Russians, Kitty!

22:45.824 --> 22:47.725
- Dad, tell Art.
- Look, Kitty.

22:47.759 --> 22:49.827
Greta warned us.
She missed all that school.

22:49.861 --> 22:51.896
She spent weeks seasick.

22:51.930 --> 22:53.998
She even met Leonardo DiCaprio.

22:54.032 --> 22:56.935
And still, no one
listened to her.

22:58.837 --> 23:00.171
Sorry.

23:00.205 --> 23:02.774
You should all be ashamed
of yourselves.

23:06.745 --> 23:09.047
You are such clever,
clever boys.

23:09.081 --> 23:10.792
- I'm clever, too.
- Yes, you are, my darling.

23:10.816 --> 23:13.151
- It's a fucking mess.
- Stop swearing.

23:13.185 --> 23:14.953
- No!
- Look, Art.

23:14.987 --> 23:17.255
It's not all bad.
We're still luckier than some.

23:17.290 --> 23:18.990
Aren't we, Dad?

23:19.024 --> 23:20.868
At least our government
doesn't want us to suffer.

23:20.892 --> 23:22.794
You mean like those poor
African kids who slowly

23:22.828 --> 23:25.763
bled to death, puking out their
guts as the intestines turned

23:25.797 --> 23:28.300
to bloody mush?
You mean like them?

23:28.334 --> 23:32.338
Yes, because my guts are going
to turn to bloody mush.

23:32.372 --> 23:34.272
How do you know?

23:34.307 --> 23:37.008
Art, stop it, please.

23:37.042 --> 23:39.043
It's true, Art. Kitty's right.

23:39.077 --> 23:41.846
At least our government
has a plan.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.983
It's not a plan,
it's a disaster.

24:04.303 --> 24:07.905
Stage one... toxic inhalation.

24:07.939 --> 24:12.777
Stage two... attack
on the nervous system.

24:12.811 --> 24:16.948
Stage three...
fatal hemorrhaging.

24:16.982 --> 24:19.150
Take your exit pill,

24:19.184 --> 24:23.121
avoid suffering,
and die with dignity.

24:25.190 --> 24:28.126
Everyone's life matters.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.662
We just want to make sure
that you understand

24:30.696 --> 24:33.998
that as your parents,
we are not to blame.

24:34.032 --> 24:36.934
This is not our choice,
and this is not our fault.

24:36.968 --> 24:38.870
I mean, clearly, it's not
your fault, either.

24:38.904 --> 24:40.439
It's...

24:40.473 --> 24:45.043
But we are not responsible
for the poison, the pills...

24:45.077 --> 24:48.713
We're just trying to do what is
best for us all,

24:48.747 --> 24:52.050
uh, to protect you
so that, um...

24:52.084 --> 24:54.986
so that you don't suffer
because suffering is bad.

24:55.020 --> 24:58.056
And in this case,
completely unnecessary.

24:58.090 --> 24:59.691
Yeah.

24:59.725 --> 25:02.160
We all deserve to live,
especially old people.

25:02.194 --> 25:03.995
Yeah.

25:04.029 --> 25:05.897
And we know that
this is the right thing to do.

25:05.931 --> 25:07.131
- Yes.
- Don't we?

25:07.165 --> 25:10.035
- Yes.
- Yeah.

25:11.069 --> 25:13.372
And we love you very much.

25:13.406 --> 25:15.807
We love you very much.

25:16.842 --> 25:18.877
You know that
we love you, right?

25:24.750 --> 25:26.685
Yeah, I suppose so.

25:28.887 --> 25:31.122
Yes, Sandra, I think so.

25:31.156 --> 25:33.825
- Yes, mom.
- Yes, mom, we know.

25:36.529 --> 25:40.065
- Sticky toffee pudding!
- Sticky toffee pudding!

25:40.766 --> 25:41.799
Oh!

25:41.833 --> 25:43.901
Mm.

25:43.935 --> 25:46.338
Oh.

25:46.372 --> 25:48.340
Ugh.

25:51.076 --> 25:52.744
- Debbie Does Dallas.
- George, George.

25:54.179 --> 25:56.348
- Wa... wa... wavy woman.
- "The Wizard of Oz"?

25:56.382 --> 25:58.216
"The Wizard of Oz"!
"The Wizard of Oz"!

25:58.250 --> 26:00.519
- Oh, "The Snowman"!
- Four words, dummy!

26:00.553 --> 26:03.322
The snowman comes to tea.

26:03.356 --> 26:06.057
- Exotic dancer.
- Is it a Demi Moore film?

26:06.091 --> 26:09.461
- "Die Hard: Die Harder."
- "Black Swan"!

26:09.495 --> 26:11.363
Fucking hell, four words.

26:13.466 --> 26:15.800
That is exactly how she looked
when she gave birth

26:15.834 --> 26:17.436
to the twins.

26:17.470 --> 26:20.271
- "Bambi"?
- "Fantastic Mr. Fox."

26:20.306 --> 26:21.916
- Things are looking up.
- "The Fox and the Hound"?

26:21.940 --> 26:24.942
Give us a clue. Sounds like?

26:24.976 --> 26:26.545
Oh, "The Day After Tomorrow"!

26:26.579 --> 26:27.879
- Yes!
- Yes!

26:27.913 --> 26:29.515
- How?
- Are you kidding me?

26:34.085 --> 26:36.220
Fuck me, Batman.

26:36.254 --> 26:38.189
Did you get that
from the hospital?

26:43.061 --> 26:46.898
Were you when the...
for the patients to see?

26:46.932 --> 26:48.800
Hm.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.476
I'll admit it.

26:57.510 --> 26:59.445
I'm scared.

27:09.422 --> 27:11.456
- Sophie's pregnant.
- Oh, that's terrific.

27:11.490 --> 27:13.224
- James, no.
- Didn't exactly plan it.

27:13.258 --> 27:16.093
- What, the poison?
- No, the baby, Tony.

27:16.127 --> 27:18.262
- Is it a baby?
- How many weeks?

27:18.297 --> 27:21.199
Still early days.

27:21.233 --> 27:23.067
She hasn't decided yet.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.870
On having the baby?

27:25.904 --> 27:29.341
The pill, Tony. She hasn't
decided about the pill. Right?

27:29.375 --> 27:30.842
Mm.

27:30.876 --> 27:32.043
Are you insane?

27:32.077 --> 27:33.278
She has a choice.

27:33.312 --> 27:34.313
No, she doesn't.

27:34.347 --> 27:36.348
What do you mean?

27:36.382 --> 27:39.284
We made a pact.

27:39.318 --> 27:41.386
You understand,
we don't have a choice.

27:41.420 --> 27:44.590
I do. But she does.

27:44.624 --> 27:46.123
Why wouldn't she?

27:46.157 --> 27:47.459
Doesn't want to hurt the baby.

27:47.493 --> 27:49.595
- It's insensitive.
- It's not the same.

27:49.629 --> 27:51.062
Or is us killing our kids.

27:51.096 --> 27:52.497
We're not killing our kids.

27:52.531 --> 27:54.567
Tony.

27:55.934 --> 27:59.405
No, you're right, you're right.
It's very different.

28:01.039 --> 28:04.543
There's no escaping poison.

28:04.577 --> 28:06.244
- I know.
- Leave it, Tony.

28:06.279 --> 28:08.547
Unless she's some sort
of fucking superwoman.

28:08.581 --> 28:11.550
Don't be insulting.

28:11.584 --> 28:15.287
Can't change her mind.
Believe me, I've tried.

28:15.321 --> 28:17.456
Can't fucking make her.

28:17.490 --> 28:20.224
Yes, well, don't tell Sandra.
She'll kill her.

28:20.258 --> 28:22.994
Not literally.

28:23.028 --> 28:24.529
James.

28:24.563 --> 28:29.166
Sophie has to keep
this to herself.

28:29.200 --> 28:33.639
It won't help telling the kids.
They won't understand.

28:33.673 --> 28:36.173
Can't protect them, James.

28:36.207 --> 28:39.311
- I know.
- Do you?

28:39.345 --> 28:41.112
Yes.

28:43.683 --> 28:45.618
Sorry, James.

28:47.953 --> 28:50.054
You'd have been
such a great father.

28:52.425 --> 28:54.926
Shit balls.

29:03.703 --> 29:05.570
Oh.

29:05.604 --> 29:08.172
- Oh.
- Yes.

29:08.206 --> 29:10.309
Hey! Wow.

29:10.343 --> 29:12.109
- Look at her.
- Bravo.

29:12.143 --> 29:13.645
Daddy, she's beautiful!

29:13.679 --> 29:16.348
And if you pull the string
on her back,

29:16.382 --> 29:18.283
she actually talks like you.

29:18.317 --> 29:20.184
- The doll talks like Kitty?
- Yeah.

29:20.218 --> 29:23.488
You can upload an app.
It's actually quite cool.

29:23.522 --> 29:25.089
Oh.

29:25.123 --> 29:26.591
I love you, daddy.

29:26.625 --> 29:30.061
You're the best daddy
in the whole wide world.

29:30.095 --> 29:32.163
Thank you, daddy!

29:32.197 --> 29:35.032
- Aw.
- Aw, I love you, sport.

29:35.066 --> 29:36.301
- Aw!
- Aw!

29:36.335 --> 29:38.035
- So sweet.
- Thank you.

29:38.069 --> 29:40.505
Oh, oh.

29:40.539 --> 29:43.642
Don't I get a hug, darling?
Come on.

29:43.676 --> 29:45.277
No, thank you.

29:45.311 --> 29:46.745
Why not?

29:46.779 --> 29:49.315
Because you're wearing
my education on your feet.

29:51.584 --> 29:55.387
You don't need it anymore.
Just... just give me a hug.

29:55.421 --> 29:57.054
I'm not hugging you.

29:57.088 --> 30:00.726
Oh, darling, I deserve a hug.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.562
Nope.

30:03.596 --> 30:05.497
Well, just a teensy-weensy,

30:05.531 --> 30:08.734
ittle-bittle, teeny-weeny little
baby hug, darling?

30:08.768 --> 30:11.102
Drop it, Sandra.

30:11.136 --> 30:12.637
Tony, speak up.

30:12.671 --> 30:15.741
Just fucking... Jesus Christ,
just fucking hug your mum

30:15.775 --> 30:19.143
so we open the rest of these
stupid fucking presents

30:19.177 --> 30:22.280
before you should fucking
Russians kill us all.

30:22.314 --> 30:26.485
Oh. Well, best do what
Psycho says.

30:32.792 --> 30:35.427
And what's with the stupid
fucking bow in her hair?

30:35.461 --> 30:38.297
All right, Art, don't take
the fucking piss.

30:42.334 --> 30:44.235
Does that mean
you don't want it, then?

30:44.269 --> 30:46.204
Dibs on it first.

30:47.573 --> 30:50.342
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

30:50.376 --> 30:52.711
- Children.
- Love you.

30:52.745 --> 30:55.647
Don't approach anything without
the Prosecco.

30:58.350 --> 31:00.585
- Just like you.
- I love you, Daddy.

31:00.619 --> 31:02.196
You're the best daddy
in the whole world.

31:02.220 --> 31:04.489
Go on, boys. Have a go.

31:04.523 --> 31:06.691
- Okay, that's gonna...
- Wow, wow.

31:06.725 --> 31:09.160
- Give it back.
- I really want to hit her.

31:10.496 --> 31:13.732
No, no, you can't hit Kitty.

31:13.766 --> 31:15.600
Like it isn't cruel enough
to give us toys

31:15.634 --> 31:17.736
we can't even play with.

31:17.770 --> 31:19.604
It's so wrong.

31:19.638 --> 31:22.407
And so stupid.

31:22.441 --> 31:26.611
Do you mom know
you're actually stupid?

31:26.645 --> 31:29.548
Well, your mom's always been
a little bit daft.

31:32.618 --> 31:35.687
We just wanted you to be happy.

31:38.557 --> 31:41.326
The batteries are going
to last longer than us.

31:47.198 --> 31:49.200
I'm so sorry, Art.

31:54.272 --> 31:57.543
Is it true that some people
haven't been given a pill?

32:01.514 --> 32:03.282
Who told you that?

32:05.684 --> 32:07.486
Just tell me the truth.

32:12.424 --> 32:14.493
Yes.

32:14.527 --> 32:18.797
Homeless people
and illegal immigrants.

32:18.831 --> 32:21.132
They won't have been
given the pill.

32:24.537 --> 32:27.506
Why?

32:27.540 --> 32:29.374
Because...

32:29.408 --> 32:33.812
according to the government,
they don't legally exist.

32:36.749 --> 32:39.551
Of course they do.

32:39.585 --> 32:42.554
Not in their system, they don't.
It's complicated.

32:44.623 --> 32:48.192
That's wrong. They're going to
die horrible, horrible deaths.

32:50.362 --> 32:53.398
We have to help them.

32:53.432 --> 32:55.767
Don't be ridiculous, Art.

32:55.801 --> 32:57.469
I'm not ridiculous.

32:57.503 --> 33:01.673
We can't even help ourselves.
All we can do is...

33:03.309 --> 33:09.814
take our pills
and choose not to suffer.

33:09.848 --> 33:11.449
We have a choice.

33:11.483 --> 33:13.752
No, no.

33:13.786 --> 33:17.322
We don't have a choice. No.

33:29.735 --> 33:32.737
Hang on, wind action.
Wind, wind, wind.

33:32.771 --> 33:34.673
Go, go, go, go, go!

33:34.707 --> 33:36.741
Okay.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.920
Shh.

35:03.562 --> 35:04.863
Shh.

35:04.897 --> 35:08.900
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, we had fun at school.

35:08.934 --> 35:10.812
Do you remember when
they had us clearing leaves

35:10.836 --> 35:12.070
from the bottom pitch?

35:12.104 --> 35:14.673
It took us days.
They just kept falling.

35:14.707 --> 35:16.608
You called the headmaster
a pervert.

35:16.642 --> 35:18.877
He accused me of stealing
Mars bars from the kitchen.

35:18.911 --> 35:20.679
- But did you?
- Yes, of course.

35:20.713 --> 35:23.048
But what was he doing
following me into the kitchen

35:23.082 --> 35:24.683
in the middle of the night?

35:24.717 --> 35:27.686
Oh, I think we know why.
Yes, we did, dirty bugger.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.487
Dirty bugger.

35:29.521 --> 35:32.724
I think I was trying
to do the same.

35:35.861 --> 35:37.996
Do you need a hand with that?

35:38.030 --> 35:40.866
- She's fine.
- Me? No, I'm fine.

35:52.711 --> 35:54.479
Love Scrabble.

35:56.982 --> 35:59.751
Just to keep me company.

35:59.785 --> 36:02.821
Oh, I'm just so thirsty.

36:02.855 --> 36:05.056
Nell was always the youngest.

36:05.090 --> 36:06.501
No, I wasn't
the youngest, James was.

36:06.525 --> 36:08.960
- Yeah.
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

36:08.994 --> 36:11.630
Oh, you were so adorable.

36:13.065 --> 36:14.733
Bella was always the oldest.

36:16.602 --> 36:19.037
Anyone want to play
Scrabble with me?

36:19.071 --> 36:23.842
Yes, um, actually, Sandra didn't
talk to me till we were 15.

36:23.876 --> 36:25.577
Oh, come on.

36:25.611 --> 36:26.845
In fact, none of you did.

36:26.879 --> 36:28.156
That's 'cause you were
terribly boring.

36:28.180 --> 36:30.115
Boring?

36:30.149 --> 36:31.783
I thought you loved me.

36:31.817 --> 36:33.661
I was just very grateful
you didn't want scratch my back.

36:33.685 --> 36:35.687
Oh, you love having
your back scratched.

36:35.721 --> 36:38.156
With you, dear, yes.

36:38.190 --> 36:41.426
And James arrived from Nigeria
with his school fees

36:41.460 --> 36:42.627
and his suitcase.

36:42.661 --> 36:44.429
- Mm.
- You were very African

36:44.463 --> 36:46.431
when you arrived.

36:47.933 --> 36:50.769
Come on, you sound like Mowgli
from "The Jungle Book."

36:50.803 --> 36:53.071
Didn't Mowgli have
an American accent?

36:53.105 --> 36:56.775
I think Mowgli's from India.

36:59.478 --> 37:01.413
How come you never fucked me?

37:01.447 --> 37:02.814
- Wow. Wow.
- Jesus, Sandra.

37:02.848 --> 37:05.150
- I just was wondering.
- James, I'm so sorry.

37:05.184 --> 37:06.951
Please do not apologize
for me, darling.

37:06.985 --> 37:08.797
No, that's right. You should
probably apologize for yourself.

37:08.821 --> 37:10.488
Oh, keep your knickers on.

37:10.522 --> 37:12.200
You know, it's just something
that always bothered me.

37:12.224 --> 37:14.692
You know?
Everyone wanted to fuck me.

37:14.726 --> 37:16.694
I didn't.

37:16.728 --> 37:18.463
Why not?

37:18.497 --> 37:20.498
Just never really did it for me.

37:20.532 --> 37:24.836
I never knew that.

37:24.870 --> 37:27.138
- Did you know that, Nell?
- No.

37:27.172 --> 37:29.007
Did you know that
her husband didn't want

37:29.041 --> 37:30.708
to have sex with you?

37:30.742 --> 37:34.145
Yes, because I just assumed
everyone did, okay?

37:34.179 --> 37:35.814
Stop being so judgy.

37:35.848 --> 37:37.715
It was hard not to be, actually.

37:37.749 --> 37:41.886
Oh, you fancy
Ms. Skinny Pants next door, hm?

37:41.920 --> 37:45.690
Ms. Potato face?
Miss Americana? Hm?

37:47.960 --> 37:49.794
Oh, come on, James.

37:49.828 --> 37:53.832
Don't go all shy on us now.

37:53.866 --> 37:55.767
I actually love Sophie.

37:55.801 --> 37:57.168
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

37:57.202 --> 37:59.070
Oh, don't worry about it.

38:01.139 --> 38:03.641
- I'm sorry. I really...
- Hey, hey, hey.

38:03.675 --> 38:05.577
She's a good person.

38:07.746 --> 38:09.981
Oh, wow.

38:10.015 --> 38:14.152
Don't. Don't make me cruel.

38:14.186 --> 38:16.754
I don't want to be cruel to you.

38:16.788 --> 38:19.491
What is this, James,
Is it pity, hm?

38:19.525 --> 38:20.692
Do you know pity me?

38:20.726 --> 38:22.627
No one pities you, Sandra.

38:22.661 --> 38:23.972
They tolerate you,
but they don't pity you.

38:23.996 --> 38:25.663
How the fuck would you know?

38:25.697 --> 38:26.898
Calm down, Sandra.

38:26.932 --> 38:28.199
Piss off, Simon!

38:28.233 --> 38:30.134
Oh, God.

38:30.168 --> 38:31.936
When we heard about
what was going to happen

38:31.970 --> 38:37.242
and I realized that I'd...
well, I'd never get to...

38:37.277 --> 38:40.712
- I'd never get to...
- Never get the fuck James?

38:40.746 --> 38:42.113
I get it.

38:42.147 --> 38:43.648
You want to fuck James, too?

38:43.682 --> 38:45.517
- No.
- Why not?

38:45.551 --> 38:47.795
- Looks exactly like James Bond.
- What are you talking about?

38:47.819 --> 38:49.254
- He does.
- I do.

38:49.289 --> 38:54.526
I get it. You guys.
Fuck, you were best friends.

38:55.794 --> 38:58.596
We're all going to die,
so you...

38:58.630 --> 39:00.208
- Fuck, you might as well...
- Fuck James.

39:00.232 --> 39:05.637
Ask! Tony, might as well ask.

39:05.671 --> 39:09.607
Don't be simple, Tony.
This isn't about you and Sandra.

39:09.641 --> 39:11.910
- Clearly.
- This is about before

39:11.944 --> 39:13.545
you and Sandra.

39:13.579 --> 39:17.248
We were best friends,
and I loved you.

39:17.283 --> 39:19.017
I really, really loved you.

39:19.051 --> 39:20.251
I loved you, too.

39:20.286 --> 39:21.553
Great.

39:21.587 --> 39:24.756
But when Mr. Tanner...

39:24.790 --> 39:26.792
When Mr Tanner, when he...

39:30.862 --> 39:32.664
I couldn't forgive you.

39:32.698 --> 39:36.734
And you didn't want to, I know
that, and he was a disgrace.

39:36.768 --> 39:38.202
I didn't understand.

39:38.236 --> 39:42.073
I felt rejected,
and I was consumed by jealousy.

39:42.107 --> 39:43.875
What are you talking about?

39:43.909 --> 39:46.611
He took you away from me,
and I hated you for that.

39:46.645 --> 39:47.979
What the fuck's
he talking about?

39:48.013 --> 39:49.691
- And then I hated myself.
- Simon, what's going on?

39:49.715 --> 39:51.082
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

39:51.116 --> 39:55.086
- It's okay, James.
- I was wrong to blame you.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.755
You were just a child.

39:57.789 --> 40:01.793
It's okay, Nell.
It's okay, right?

40:01.827 --> 40:04.662
No.

40:04.696 --> 40:06.264
No, it's not okay.

40:06.299 --> 40:09.734
- No, I know. I was...
- Yes.

40:09.768 --> 40:11.903
- You were.
- Dear.

40:11.937 --> 40:13.305
Tony, darling, look...

40:13.339 --> 40:15.374
I'm sorry, Sandra.

40:15.408 --> 40:17.241
Tony darling isn't here.

40:17.276 --> 40:18.710
It wasn't James' fault.

40:18.744 --> 40:20.379
No.

40:20.413 --> 40:22.180
Of course it wasn't.

40:22.214 --> 40:25.149
But you didn't do anything.

40:25.183 --> 40:27.151
Did you?

40:27.185 --> 40:31.856
And it slithered away
like a... like a...

40:34.726 --> 40:36.060
Like some sort of coward.

40:36.094 --> 40:37.161
Tony.

40:37.195 --> 40:40.665
- Tony, darling.
- What?

40:40.699 --> 40:42.634
Look, we've all done things
we regret.

40:42.668 --> 40:45.203
- What?
- Yes.

40:45.237 --> 40:46.814
Darling, haven't you ever
made a mistake?

40:46.838 --> 40:48.873
No, I haven't. No, no.
Not of this magnitude.

40:48.907 --> 40:50.174
- No? Never?
- No, I haven't.

40:50.208 --> 40:51.276
- Surely.
- No.

40:51.310 --> 40:52.710
- No?
- No, not once.

40:52.744 --> 40:54.184
- Once?
- What are you talking about?

40:54.212 --> 40:57.048
- Darling, surely...
- I still have things to say.

40:57.082 --> 40:59.352
- What?
- Oh, fuck.

41:04.790 --> 41:05.923
What?!

41:05.957 --> 41:08.327
Me and Tone.

41:08.361 --> 41:10.194
You had sex with Tony?!

41:11.763 --> 41:13.164
Years ago.

41:13.198 --> 41:15.700
I fucking hope so!

41:15.734 --> 41:18.337
- I told you.
- When?!

41:18.371 --> 41:21.039
Uh...

41:21.073 --> 41:23.375
Uh...

41:23.409 --> 41:27.879
I don't know, I can't remember,
but I remember telling you

41:27.913 --> 41:30.148
that I had done you
and Tony a favor.

41:30.182 --> 41:32.750
Fucking Tony was a favor?

41:32.784 --> 41:35.253
Yes, Sandra.

41:35.288 --> 41:37.356
Actually rather heroic.

41:37.390 --> 41:38.756
Heroic?

41:40.092 --> 41:41.726
What the fuck?

41:41.760 --> 41:43.237
I was killing two birds
with one stone.

41:43.261 --> 41:46.164
I had to try shagging
a bloke and...

41:46.198 --> 41:47.999
Shut the fuck up.

41:48.033 --> 41:51.336
Why not be of service
to you both?

41:51.370 --> 41:56.375
I was fundamentally

41:56.409 --> 42:01.413
instrumental in getting you
back together again.

42:01.447 --> 42:04.115
Mm.

42:04.149 --> 42:05.850
Given the circumstances,

42:05.884 --> 42:08.454
sort of an act of
sacrificial love.

42:08.488 --> 42:10.822
Yes! Yes!

42:10.856 --> 42:13.057
It is that. It fucking was!

42:13.091 --> 42:15.226
- Yeah, yeah.
- It was!

42:15.260 --> 42:18.129
Right, Tony? Bella was just
trying to boost your ego.

42:18.163 --> 42:20.765
- Didn't fucking work!
- Didn't fucking work!

42:22.234 --> 42:23.935
Okay. Okay.

42:23.969 --> 42:25.803
Here's to us.

42:25.837 --> 42:28.272
- May we rest in love.
- Yes! In love.

42:28.307 --> 42:29.807
In love. Come on.

42:29.841 --> 42:31.075
Come on, stand up.

42:31.109 --> 42:33.111
Come on, San, come on, Tone.

42:33.145 --> 42:34.956
- Come on. It's Christmas.
- Come on. Come on, come on.

42:34.980 --> 42:37.081
There we go.

42:37.115 --> 42:38.517
All right.

42:38.551 --> 42:41.286
Oh, that was intense.

42:41.320 --> 42:42.488
Tone, we okay?

42:42.522 --> 42:44.289
Yeah.

43:00.506 --> 43:03.442
These twisters are
a precursor to the cloud

43:03.476 --> 43:08.246
arriving and carry
poisonous gases.

43:08.281 --> 43:10.248
Avoid suffering.

43:10.283 --> 43:13.885
Take your exit pill
and die with dignity.

43:13.919 --> 43:15.820
Art, can I come in?

43:15.854 --> 43:17.822
Sure.

43:21.360 --> 43:23.227
You okay?

43:23.261 --> 43:25.397
What are you doing?

43:32.572 --> 43:34.005
Please don't tell my dad.

43:34.039 --> 43:35.974
No, I won't.

43:40.245 --> 43:41.979
I can't help it.

43:42.013 --> 43:44.182
I don't know what else to do.

43:44.216 --> 43:45.983
I understand.

43:46.017 --> 43:48.186
Art?

43:51.524 --> 43:54.526
Come on. Got to call Grandma.

43:54.560 --> 43:56.961
- Cool, great.
- Yeah.

44:04.337 --> 44:07.238
This is typical fucking Lizzy.

44:07.272 --> 44:09.874
She's not even here,
and she's ruining the vibe.

44:09.908 --> 44:11.343
Hi. Yeah, you've reached Lizzy.

44:11.377 --> 44:12.877
Yeah, leave me a message!

44:15.348 --> 44:19.150
You are completely pissed.

44:19.184 --> 44:21.919
I'm fine.

44:21.953 --> 44:25.524
I'm fine. I just...
I need a little snooze.

44:25.558 --> 44:28.527
Oh, be careful.

44:28.561 --> 44:31.830
- Hey!
- Yeah, okay, okay.

44:36.034 --> 44:38.102
You promised me.

44:38.136 --> 44:40.004
I can't help it.

44:42.642 --> 44:44.041
They're so mean.

44:44.075 --> 44:45.577
Oh!

44:45.611 --> 44:47.144
Fucking hell.

44:47.178 --> 44:48.913
Oh.

44:50.616 --> 44:52.884
I miss my mom.

44:55.153 --> 44:57.088
Mm.

45:03.529 --> 45:06.532
Oh, God.

45:09.100 --> 45:10.636
Alex is asleep.

45:10.670 --> 45:11.969
Already?!

45:12.003 --> 45:14.071
No, no.

45:14.105 --> 45:17.041
Just drunk.

45:17.075 --> 45:20.211
Are we really going to die?

45:20.245 --> 45:22.414
I know I'm not brave.

45:22.448 --> 45:25.082
Um...

45:25.116 --> 45:27.452
can't even cope with a cold.

45:27.486 --> 45:30.322
But you believe the government?

45:30.356 --> 45:32.056
Oh, no.

45:32.090 --> 45:34.158
They killed Diana.

45:34.192 --> 45:36.462
Shit.

45:37.195 --> 45:40.532
We've seen it everywhere
on the news.

45:40.566 --> 45:42.367
The unimaginable horrors

45:42.401 --> 45:44.235
that have happened
all over the world.

45:44.269 --> 45:46.438
I mean, you cannot
make this shit up.

45:46.472 --> 45:48.205
And I've seen the road.

45:48.239 --> 45:53.077
And there is no fucking way
I am living like that.

45:53.111 --> 45:55.480
I can't do post-apocalyptic
monochrome.

45:55.514 --> 45:57.649
I've never seen it. Should I?

45:57.683 --> 45:59.951
No, no.

45:59.985 --> 46:03.422
It's fucking miserable.

46:06.492 --> 46:09.093
Oh, poor Al. She wouldn't
cope on her own.

46:09.127 --> 46:13.097
She's far too fragile. You know?

46:13.131 --> 46:15.634
Yeah.

46:15.668 --> 46:17.268
She is.

46:17.303 --> 46:22.006
Darling, can you see her
running away from zombies?

46:22.040 --> 46:24.008
Not in a hurry. No.

46:26.412 --> 46:28.246
Oh.

46:30.248 --> 46:33.985
We should have all voted Green.

46:34.019 --> 46:36.688
Fucking conservatives.

46:39.024 --> 46:40.559
- Hey!
- Grandma!

46:40.593 --> 46:43.127
Hello, boys. Happy Christmas.

46:43.161 --> 46:44.396
You're still alive!

46:44.430 --> 46:45.764
Yes, I think so.

46:45.798 --> 46:47.766
Grandma, is the Queen dead?

46:47.800 --> 46:50.101
Oh, I don't know, darling.

46:50.135 --> 46:52.069
Is she in a bunker full
of dog food?

46:52.103 --> 46:54.171
Yes, quite possibly.

46:54.205 --> 46:57.409
She should be prepared to die
with the rest of her people.

46:57.443 --> 47:01.413
Oh, darling.
Are you having a bad night?

47:01.447 --> 47:03.648
Tony and Simon robbed
the petrol station.

47:03.682 --> 47:05.784
- Oh, what fun?
- Hmm.

47:05.818 --> 47:07.386
Kitty wanted
sticky toffee pudding.

47:07.420 --> 47:09.354
Yes, excellent choice.

47:09.388 --> 47:11.088
Thanks for lending us
the house, mum.

47:11.122 --> 47:12.734
- Thank you so much.
- It's been so lovely

47:12.758 --> 47:14.091
to have everyone back together.

47:14.125 --> 47:15.494
Just brilliant.

47:15.528 --> 47:17.161
We miss you, though.

47:17.195 --> 47:19.598
I wish you weren't so far away.

47:19.632 --> 47:23.034
Well, yes. Um, darling,
I best go. I...

47:23.068 --> 47:25.303
I've got to Zoom
the bridge girls.

47:25.337 --> 47:29.040
Mum, mum, please wait.

47:29.074 --> 47:31.042
Nellie, it's all right.

47:33.279 --> 47:36.482
Your father's up there
waiting for us all.

47:37.817 --> 47:40.386
He'll be so thrilled to see you.

47:43.622 --> 47:46.391
- Mom?
- Goodbye, my darling girl.

47:46.425 --> 47:49.728
- Mom, are you okay?
- Hang in there.

47:49.762 --> 47:52.230
Goodbye, Simon.

47:55.100 --> 47:56.568
Grandma?

47:56.602 --> 47:58.704
Where did Grandma go?

48:00.639 --> 48:02.307
I didn't event get to say
goodbye to her.

48:06.177 --> 48:07.178
Call her back.

48:07.212 --> 48:08.480
No, darling.

48:08.514 --> 48:10.549
I didn't get to say
goodbye to her!

48:15.153 --> 48:16.120
Please, Dad.

48:16.154 --> 48:18.323
No, boys. I'm sorry.

48:18.357 --> 48:21.092
Stop being such an asshole
and call her back!

48:21.126 --> 48:23.295
I said no, Art. That's it.

48:30.469 --> 48:33.137
Darling?

48:59.532 --> 49:01.299
My poor mother!

49:01.333 --> 49:02.834
She's all alone!

49:02.868 --> 49:04.870
Darling.

49:11.176 --> 49:12.744
I need you, Nell.

49:19.919 --> 49:22.321
Come on.

49:25.824 --> 49:27.860
Come on.

49:29.662 --> 49:30.762
Dance with me.

50:43.535 --> 50:44.669
Can I come in?

50:44.703 --> 50:46.905
Of course you can.

50:58.951 --> 51:00.885
You're a... you're a a doctor,
right?

51:00.919 --> 51:02.420
A cancer doctor.

51:02.454 --> 51:04.856
Yes, I am.

51:04.890 --> 51:07.959
So you know about death.

51:07.993 --> 51:09.795
Mm-hmm.

51:12.298 --> 51:14.433
I'm not going to take the pill.

51:19.505 --> 51:21.873
It won't hurt you, Art.

51:21.907 --> 51:24.309
Well, it will. It'll kill me.

51:25.577 --> 51:28.546
I mean, it's painless.

51:28.580 --> 51:30.282
I'm not scared of pain.

51:30.316 --> 51:32.284
Oh, Art.

51:32.318 --> 51:36.288
You don't know
anything about pain.

51:36.322 --> 51:39.291
I know don't want to die.

51:39.325 --> 51:41.359
Pain...

51:41.393 --> 51:44.896
Pain is... intolerable.

51:44.930 --> 51:48.600
Pain is why some people
choose to die.

51:48.634 --> 51:52.070
Well, I don't care,
I'm not taking it.

51:52.104 --> 51:54.673
Okay. Okay.

51:54.707 --> 51:57.475
Wait. Where are you going.

51:57.509 --> 51:59.444
To get his parents.

52:11.824 --> 52:14.359
Maybe somewhere somebody
has survived the gas.

52:14.393 --> 52:15.960
Not one single being survived.

52:15.994 --> 52:17.595
Says who?

52:17.629 --> 52:18.830
The people who know.

52:18.864 --> 52:21.366
- You mean the government?
- Yes.

52:21.400 --> 52:22.901
And scientists.

52:22.935 --> 52:25.804
But what if they're wrong?

52:25.838 --> 52:27.372
Excuse me?

52:27.406 --> 52:29.607
Last time, Mr. Fullam,
my math teacher,

52:29.641 --> 52:32.610
well, he got something wrong,
he didn't realize it at first,

52:32.644 --> 52:35.580
and he told poor Tommy
off for challenging him,

52:35.614 --> 52:37.659
but he had to find Tommy after
break and apologize to him

52:37.683 --> 52:40.886
because Tommy was right
and Mr. Fullam was wrong.

52:43.455 --> 52:44.989
He's very clever, Tommy.

52:45.023 --> 52:47.625
Well, is Tommy taking the pill?

52:47.659 --> 52:50.695
Probably. His mother hates him.

52:50.729 --> 52:53.832
What if the best scientist died,
and then... and then

52:53.866 --> 52:56.468
the lazy one took over, and then
the lazy one went home

52:56.502 --> 52:59.070
one night, and forgot to upload
some file, and then...

52:59.104 --> 53:01.973
and then died in the morning?

53:02.007 --> 53:04.442
What if one of the shit
scientists is in charge

53:04.476 --> 53:05.744
of whether I live or die?

53:05.778 --> 53:07.912
Hey, hey.

53:07.946 --> 53:10.382
This isn't pretend, Art.

53:10.416 --> 53:13.818
There isn't someone somewhere
who's made a mistake.

53:13.852 --> 53:15.597
People don't generally know
they made a mistake

53:15.621 --> 53:17.989
until they've made it,
and then we'll all be dead,

53:18.023 --> 53:21.126
and then there won't be
anyone to apologize to.

53:21.160 --> 53:22.761
I'm sorry.

53:22.795 --> 53:24.095
I really am.

53:24.129 --> 53:27.065
But I can't make this
better for you.

53:27.099 --> 53:29.567
Well, what about
those poor people?

53:29.601 --> 53:31.546
Who's going to hold their hand
while they die in pain?

53:31.570 --> 53:33.171
Life isn't fair, Art.

53:33.205 --> 53:36.441
That's what people say when they
don't want to find a solution.

53:37.976 --> 53:39.844
You can't help them.

53:39.878 --> 53:42.981
But you can. You're a doctor.
You're supposed to save people.

Hey, you're very kind boy, Art.

55:15.974 --> 55:17.242
I'm not kind.

55:17.277 --> 55:18.776
I just don't want to give up,

55:18.810 --> 55:21.313
and I don't think
anyone else should either.

56:52.738 --> 56:54.005
I'm pregnant.

56:54.039 --> 56:56.975
So I'm not going
to take the pill.

56:57.009 --> 57:00.279
Does being pregnant
mean you won't die?

57:00.313 --> 57:03.048
I will, but not from the pill.

57:07.019 --> 57:08.954
I don't want to kill my baby.

57:09.655 --> 57:11.790
Art?

57:12.824 --> 57:14.326
What's going on?

57:14.360 --> 57:16.405
Sophie's pregnant. She doesn't
want to kill her baby.

57:16.429 --> 57:18.706
So she's not going to the pill,
so I'm going to stay alive

57:18.730 --> 57:21.032
and hold her hand when she dies.

57:21.066 --> 57:23.001
Is that cool with you?

57:26.071 --> 57:27.038
Simon!

57:27.072 --> 57:29.107
Yay!

57:34.212 --> 57:35.414
You're overreacting.

57:35.448 --> 57:36.948
I am your mother Art,

57:36.982 --> 57:38.182
- I know.
- Not her.

57:38.216 --> 57:39.784
- I know.
- You don't just ask

57:39.818 --> 57:41.062
- some stranger.
- She's hardly a stranger.

57:41.086 --> 57:42.421
- Oh, shut up.
- You shut up.

57:42.455 --> 57:43.988
- You shut up.
- No, you shut up.

57:44.022 --> 57:46.190
- You shut up.
- You shut up.

57:46.224 --> 57:47.925
- Shut up!
- Stop copying me, you stu...

57:47.959 --> 57:51.963
Don't you talk
to your mother like that!

57:51.997 --> 57:53.798
At least Sophie cares
about her child.

57:53.832 --> 57:56.801
- How dare you?!
- How dare you?!

57:56.835 --> 57:58.136
What's going on, Art?

57:58.170 --> 58:01.272
I'm taking that fucking pill.

58:01.307 --> 58:03.908
Yes, you are.

58:03.942 --> 58:06.744
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you fucking are.

58:06.778 --> 58:09.381
- No, I'm fucking not.
- Stop swearing.

58:09.415 --> 58:11.716
See, you made a rule,
and you can't even stick to it.

58:11.750 --> 58:13.385
We are your parents.

58:13.419 --> 58:15.687
You want to murder me.

58:15.721 --> 58:18.256
Just stop. Stop it. Stop it.

58:18.291 --> 58:19.757
God says thou shall not kill.

58:19.791 --> 58:21.760
Fuck God!

58:24.229 --> 58:26.432
- I knew it.
- He just tricked you.

58:26.466 --> 58:28.367
Yes, I know.

58:28.401 --> 58:32.904
So you don't even believe
in God. You're just afraid.

58:32.938 --> 58:34.172
Yes, I-I am.

58:34.206 --> 58:36.774
I am... I am afraid.

58:36.808 --> 58:39.778
I am absolutely terrified.

58:41.280 --> 58:43.147
Please, Dad, stay with me.

58:43.181 --> 58:44.882
We can hide from
the poison together.

58:44.916 --> 58:46.818
We can... we can
shut the windows,

58:46.852 --> 58:51.390
and we can barricade the doors,
and we can wait it out.

58:51.424 --> 58:54.759
Please, Dad, I need a grown up.
I can't do it on my own.

58:58.163 --> 59:01.899
It'll be airborne, Art.

59:01.933 --> 59:04.035
It will travel
through the windows,

59:04.069 --> 59:07.038
the doors, the water pipes.

59:07.072 --> 59:09.741
You can't hide from it, Art.

59:10.909 --> 59:13.978
It will kill anything and anyone
that is still alive.

59:14.012 --> 59:15.380
Yes.

59:15.414 --> 59:17.182
I don't believe you.

59:19.785 --> 59:22.321
Okay, come here. Come here.

59:24.923 --> 59:28.192
Your father and I have discussed
this over and over again.

59:28.226 --> 59:31.896
We have discussed
every possible option.

59:31.930 --> 59:34.031
If... if... if we don't
take the pill,

59:34.065 --> 59:36.901
if you don't take the pill,
if... if your brothers

59:36.935 --> 59:39.938
don't take the pill...
look at me, look at me.

59:43.509 --> 59:48.045
But the outcome
is always the same.

59:48.079 --> 59:50.148
And in no particular order.

59:52.351 --> 59:56.154
We will all die one by one.

59:56.188 --> 01:00:01.059
And you will be left crying
with no one to comfort you.

01:00:03.329 --> 01:00:05.096
And I can't do that.

01:00:06.599 --> 01:00:09.234
I can't let babies suffer alone.

01:00:15.207 --> 01:00:17.276
I don't mind anymore.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:19.210
What?

01:00:20.613 --> 01:00:23.315
I said I don't mind anymore.

01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:26.552
We're your family, Art.

01:00:30.088 --> 01:00:32.257
Not if you kill me, we're not.

01:00:35.894 --> 01:00:37.896
Art!

01:00:39.599 --> 01:00:42.967
- Art?
- Art!

01:00:53.579 --> 01:00:56.382
Art, come back.
You're scaring me.

01:01:04.657 --> 01:01:06.492
Art?!

01:01:23.241 --> 01:01:25.076
Belinda?

01:01:31.484 --> 01:01:34.586
Art!

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:37.422
Art!

01:01:37.456 --> 01:01:39.224
Where are you?!

01:02:34.212 --> 01:02:37.282
Art! Art!

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:42.053
Simon!

01:02:45.223 --> 01:02:48.159
Art!

01:02:54.099 --> 01:02:56.535
Jesus Christ.

01:02:56.569 --> 01:02:59.203
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

01:03:00.373 --> 01:03:02.474
We have to... Come on! Go!

01:03:02.508 --> 01:03:05.076
Come on! Come on!

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:06.243
Watch it!

01:03:08.781 --> 01:03:10.716
Run!

01:03:19.492 --> 01:03:23.194
Get inside! Get inside!

01:03:34.573 --> 01:03:36.007
Kids, go to your room.

01:03:37.376 --> 01:03:38.410
What's happened?

01:03:38.444 --> 01:03:40.044
- Now!
- Is he okay?

01:03:40.078 --> 01:03:41.145
- He's upset.
- Mommy.

01:03:41.179 --> 01:03:42.447
Shall I take him upstairs?

01:03:42.481 --> 01:03:44.081
Just take the twins
to their room. Go.

01:03:44.115 --> 01:03:45.350
- Mommy?
- Okay, come, kids.

01:03:45.384 --> 01:03:47.118
Come on, boys.
Come on, quick, quick.

01:03:47.152 --> 01:03:48.420
I'll be up in a minute.

01:03:48.454 --> 01:03:50.522
- Don't be creepy.
- Simon, let me help.

01:03:50.556 --> 01:03:52.557
- Fuck off.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:03:52.591 --> 01:03:54.626
- I'm sorry.
- Just... Just give me a second.

01:03:59.097 --> 01:04:01.400
Just let me take him
upstairs to Nell.

01:04:01.434 --> 01:04:03.802
Let him take him to Nell.

01:04:03.836 --> 01:04:05.504
Hey.

01:04:05.538 --> 01:04:07.539
Here, champ, I got you.

01:04:07.573 --> 01:04:10.241
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

01:04:10.276 --> 01:04:12.344
I got you. Tony.

01:04:13.779 --> 01:04:17.215
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

01:04:22.755 --> 01:04:24.556
Fuck!

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:28.727
I got you.

01:04:30.228 --> 01:04:32.631
They're all fucking dead.

01:04:32.665 --> 01:04:34.566
Who's dead?

01:04:36.769 --> 01:04:39.136
Here you are. It's okay.
It's okay.

01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:41.573
I'm sorry.

01:04:41.607 --> 01:04:44.509
Just go get Nell.
I'm going to check on Simon.

01:04:44.543 --> 01:04:46.411
Okay.

01:04:46.445 --> 01:04:48.145
We're going to get
your mom, okay?

01:04:48.179 --> 01:04:51.517
We'll go and get your mom.
It's gonna be okay.

01:04:52.284 --> 01:04:53.351
Who's dead?

01:04:53.385 --> 01:04:56.822
They're all fucking dead, Tony.

01:04:56.856 --> 01:05:01.460
Of course they are.
Most of the world's dead.

01:05:09.301 --> 01:05:12.537
Art's okay.
He's upstairs with Nell.

01:05:14.306 --> 01:05:18.376
Don't swallow.
I'm sorry. I can't understand.

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:21.313
What is it? What is it?

01:05:21.347 --> 01:05:24.148
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:05:24.182 --> 01:05:26.318
Just breathe.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.524
Now, if you can,
start from the beginning.

01:05:33.258 --> 01:05:34.836
I went and took the chickens...
I took the chickens out

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:37.161
at about 12:30 p.m.

01:05:37.195 --> 01:05:40.365
Sorry, are you joking?

01:05:40.399 --> 01:05:42.434
Tell us what happened?

01:05:42.468 --> 01:05:43.602
Hey, hey.

01:05:43.636 --> 01:05:45.871
Art ran off.

01:05:45.905 --> 01:05:48.840
And I found him...
I found him on the side

01:05:48.874 --> 01:05:51.810
of the road with this car.

01:05:51.844 --> 01:05:53.445
And they were all dead, James.

01:05:53.479 --> 01:05:55.614
There was even a baby.

01:05:59.217 --> 01:06:01.286
I'll go get your mom.

01:06:07.626 --> 01:06:10.662
Nell? Nell?

01:06:43.762 --> 01:06:45.797
But then the wind changed,

01:06:45.831 --> 01:06:48.967
and then all I could
hear Art screaming.

01:06:50.636 --> 01:06:52.604
Tony, don't!

01:06:52.638 --> 01:06:54.706
- Simon.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:58.376
Simon, the bodies, the bodies,
was there any blood

01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:00.679
in the ears, eyes, mouth?

01:07:00.713 --> 01:07:01.947
Vomit?

01:07:01.981 --> 01:07:03.615
Were they sweating?
Was there urine?

01:07:03.649 --> 01:07:06.351
Stop it, James. Just stop it!

01:07:06.385 --> 01:07:08.554
Poison's not coming
till tomorrow.

01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:14.459
It is tomorrow.

01:07:14.493 --> 01:07:16.895
I'll go and check on Art.

01:07:24.737 --> 01:07:27.305
I was just checking on Art.

01:07:27.339 --> 01:07:29.474
No, no.

01:07:30.809 --> 01:07:35.280
I get it. You're pregnant.
And that is unimaginable.

01:07:35.314 --> 01:07:37.515
But Art is my son.

01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:41.587
This is my family, and we have
had enough of you interfering.

01:08:05.878 --> 01:08:09.447
Oh. Oh, uh...

01:08:09.481 --> 01:08:14.386
Simon, you are a good man.

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.889
An excellent father.

01:08:17.923 --> 01:08:20.359
And a darling friend.

01:08:20.559 --> 01:08:21.960
Hm?

01:08:24.063 --> 01:08:28.332
But it is time, hm?

01:08:28.367 --> 01:08:31.569
- Mm-hmm?
- Hm.

01:08:31.603 --> 01:08:33.872
Let's go.

01:08:39.712 --> 01:08:41.345
It's gonna be fine.

01:08:59.564 --> 01:09:01.300
Shit!

01:09:15.046 --> 01:09:17.582
I love you both.

01:09:18.617 --> 01:09:20.786
Go and be with your families.

01:09:23.589 --> 01:09:25.424
Go on.

01:09:28.127 --> 01:09:30.828
Right behind you.

01:09:35.434 --> 01:09:37.069
Cheers.

01:09:48.113 --> 01:09:50.048
Shh.

01:09:50.082 --> 01:09:52.817
You're my beautiful boy.

01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:54.619
Tell me what happened,
sweetheart.

01:09:54.653 --> 01:09:57.422
- Art, what happened?
- Do you a hug?

01:09:59.124 --> 01:10:01.993
Are you exhausted?

01:10:02.027 --> 01:10:04.863
He's exhausted. It's all right.

01:10:13.439 --> 01:10:15.474
Have I always been boring?

01:10:21.447 --> 01:10:24.450
But you're so much more
than that.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.488
What happened out there?

01:10:30.522 --> 01:10:31.956
Are you okay, Daddy?

01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:34.025
Is Art having a breakdown?

01:10:34.059 --> 01:10:36.828
No, he's just, um...

01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:40.198
He's just very upset.

01:10:40.232 --> 01:10:41.966
Has he calmed down yet?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.136
Yeah.

01:10:48.941 --> 01:10:52.010
It's time, boys.

01:10:54.112 --> 01:10:56.147
Already?

01:10:56.181 --> 01:10:58.650
Yes, I'm sorry.

01:11:22.808 --> 01:11:24.810
I didn't mean to hurt Nell.

01:11:32.518 --> 01:11:33.918
Fuck.

01:11:33.952 --> 01:11:35.787
Was I wrong?

01:11:37.923 --> 01:11:40.058
Is Art gonna be okay?

01:11:43.161 --> 01:11:44.696
You promised us a can each.

01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:46.798
I'm not sharing, Dad.

01:11:49.302 --> 01:11:51.736
The right, darling.

01:12:00.913 --> 01:12:02.714
Al?

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:07.619
Please... wake up.

01:12:08.754 --> 01:12:12.090
Please wake up. Please wake up.

01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:19.931
Please wake up!

01:12:30.008 --> 01:12:32.010
Sorry.

01:12:54.166 --> 01:12:56.734
Here you go, darling.

01:12:56.768 --> 01:12:58.202
It's warm, Dad.

01:12:58.236 --> 01:12:59.904
Mine too.

01:12:59.938 --> 01:13:02.674
Art, is yours warm?

01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:03.841
Yep.

01:13:03.875 --> 01:13:05.743
- Dad?
- Dad?

01:13:05.777 --> 01:13:09.180
Jesus Christ.

01:13:18.824 --> 01:13:21.560
I'll miss you.

01:14:04.903 --> 01:14:06.004
What are you doing?

01:14:06.038 --> 01:14:08.106
Sophie...

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:12.911
do you want both of us
and our baby to die in agony?

01:14:14.012 --> 01:14:16.982
Because I won't take my pill
if you don't take yours.

01:14:32.698 --> 01:14:34.966
- Thank you.
- There you go, darling.

01:14:37.836 --> 01:14:40.138
Be careful.

01:14:40.172 --> 01:14:42.341
Sorry, mom.

01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:45.109
It's all right, sweetheart.

01:14:45.143 --> 01:14:46.811
Fucking hell, Hardy!

01:14:46.845 --> 01:14:48.290
- It's not my fault.
- Dad must have dropped it.

01:14:48.314 --> 01:14:49.914
Did you drop the Coke?

01:14:49.948 --> 01:14:52.183
I can't remember.

01:14:52.217 --> 01:14:54.286
Fuck's sake.

01:14:57.323 --> 01:14:58.823
Shit.

01:14:58.857 --> 01:15:00.024
Fucking hell.

01:15:00.058 --> 01:15:01.059
Darling.

01:15:01.093 --> 01:15:02.294
- Dad.
- Dad.

01:15:18.009 --> 01:15:20.446
I haven't said goodbye to Nell!

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.713
I haven't said goodbye to Art.

01:15:21.747 --> 01:15:23.047
I haven't said goodbye to Simon.

01:15:23.081 --> 01:15:26.150
Hold me. Please, please,
Kitty, just once.

01:15:26.184 --> 01:15:27.251
I'll hold you.

01:15:27.286 --> 01:15:29.821
No. No, I want Kitty.

01:15:29.855 --> 01:15:30.922
Please, darling.

01:15:30.956 --> 01:15:33.024
My doll! Baby Kitty!

01:15:33.058 --> 01:15:36.894
Oh, no, Kitty, wait. I'll come.
My legs... I can't feel my legs.

01:15:36.928 --> 01:15:39.331
Stop.

01:15:39.365 --> 01:15:41.199
K-K...

01:15:43.101 --> 01:15:44.269
Kitty!

01:16:32.585 --> 01:16:34.218
No!

01:16:54.105 --> 01:16:57.008
Say when.

01:16:57.042 --> 01:16:59.311
Stop.

01:17:00.413 --> 01:17:02.847
Compare.

01:17:02.881 --> 01:17:04.883
Okay.

01:17:08.521 --> 01:17:10.254
Happy?

01:17:10.289 --> 01:17:12.023
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:17:22.167 --> 01:17:23.968
All right.

01:17:25.571 --> 01:17:27.205
Palm out.

01:17:27.873 --> 01:17:29.207
Palm.

01:17:29.241 --> 01:17:31.843
- They're huge.
- Massive.

01:17:31.877 --> 01:17:34.513
How are we going
to swallow them?

01:17:34.547 --> 01:17:37.616
Mum.

01:17:37.650 --> 01:17:39.851
Art.

01:17:39.885 --> 01:17:44.389
- Art, darling.
- Art, wake up.

01:17:44.423 --> 01:17:48.293
- Art, wake up.
- Art?

01:17:48.327 --> 01:17:51.463
- Geez!
- Oh, my God!

01:17:53.532 --> 01:17:57.101
Oh, my God!

01:17:57.135 --> 01:17:59.204
Shit, shit.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.610
Coke.

01:18:04.644 --> 01:18:06.378
- Dad?
- Mum?

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.349
Ah.

01:18:10.383 --> 01:18:12.984
Okay, did you swallow it?
You swallowed it?

01:18:13.018 --> 01:18:14.218
Have you swallowed it? Yes?

01:18:14.252 --> 01:18:15.987
Okay.

01:18:20.025 --> 01:18:23.127
My baby.

01:18:23.696 --> 01:18:26.532
Oh, fuck.

01:18:28.701 --> 01:18:30.268
Son.

01:18:30.303 --> 01:18:32.170
Okay.

01:18:39.312 --> 01:18:41.380
Alright, everyone.

01:18:41.414 --> 01:18:43.981
Everyone get into bed,
close your eyes.

01:18:44.015 --> 01:18:45.684
Okay, okay, come on.

01:18:45.718 --> 01:18:47.118
On the bed.

01:18:56.161 --> 01:18:57.995
Jesus.

01:18:58.029 --> 01:18:59.398
How much did I drink?

01:18:59.432 --> 01:19:02.199
Fucking hell! For fuck sake!

01:19:02.233 --> 01:19:03.935
Where is everyone?

01:19:03.969 --> 01:19:06.605
We've got five minutes.

01:19:06.639 --> 01:19:08.407
Okay.

01:19:11.076 --> 01:19:13.211
Five fucking minutes!

01:20:09.702 --> 01:20:11.235
Dad?

01:21:02.721 --> 01:21:04.523
What the fuck, Bella?

01:21:04.557 --> 01:21:07.058
You puked up the pill.

01:21:07.092 --> 01:21:11.162
Fuckin' piss head.

01:21:34.687 --> 01:21:36.655
I want you to think of heaven.

01:21:36.689 --> 01:21:42.159
I want you to imagine a cloud
that's... a giant cloud

01:21:42.193 --> 01:21:44.161
that's made of candy...
Oh, my God!

01:21:44.195 --> 01:21:45.597
I haven't said goodbye
to Sandra.

01:21:45.631 --> 01:21:46.865
- No.
- No, I have to.

01:21:46.899 --> 01:21:48.500
There's no time, Nell. Just...

01:21:48.534 --> 01:21:53.071
Just stay with us.
Lie down. Close your eyes.

01:21:57.610 --> 01:21:59.344
I love you, Daddy.

01:21:59.378 --> 01:22:01.379
You're the best daddy...

01:22:01.413 --> 01:22:07.352
in the whole wide world.

01:22:08.787 --> 01:22:10.822
I love you, mom.

01:22:10.856 --> 01:22:12.189
I love you, Hardy.

01:22:12.223 --> 01:22:14.759
I love you, dad.

01:22:14.793 --> 01:22:16.193
I love you, Hardy.

01:22:16.227 --> 01:22:17.261
I love you, mom.

01:22:17.296 --> 01:22:18.730
I love you, Thomas.

01:22:18.764 --> 01:22:20.699
I love you, dad.

01:22:20.733 --> 01:22:23.502
I love you, Thomas.

01:22:23.536 --> 01:22:25.838
I love you, darling.

01:22:28.307 --> 01:22:31.309
Sleep, my darling.

01:22:31.343 --> 01:22:33.812
I love you always.

01:22:33.846 --> 01:22:36.748
- I love you, Art.
- I love you, Art.
