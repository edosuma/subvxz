Come on, Mateo,
get it right.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.250
Hey, Mr. Almost
the Royal Wizard.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.790
It's almost time
for the ceremony.
Are you ready?

01:16.790 --> 01:18.170
What Sure.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.460
Well, maybe.

01:19.460 --> 01:21.420
Everything will be fine.

01:21.420 --> 01:23.750
I'll say a few words,
you'll do a little magic,

01:23.750 --> 01:25.670
and we're done.
What could go wrong?

01:25.670 --> 01:27.880
He could mess up a spell
and destroy the world
as we know it.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.210
No, I don't think
any of my spells could do that.

01:30.210 --> 01:32.620
Could they?

01:32.620 --> 01:33.880
Don't worry, Mateo.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.960
I know you'll do great.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.710
Your grandfather
was a royal wizard.

01:37.710 --> 01:40.250
It's in your blood.
And it'll be a friendly crowd.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.790
Crowd

01:42.790 --> 01:46.380
I invited a few people.

01:46.380 --> 01:49.040
Oh, wow, you didn't
have to do that.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.040
Why did you do that?

01:51.040 --> 01:54.120
Because I wanted
everyone to meet
our new royal wizard.

01:54.120 --> 01:57.040
Now come on.
Let's greet the guests.

02:00.460 --> 02:02.000
Welcome to the palace.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.620
Name, please.

02:03.620 --> 02:05.120
Fiero.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.750
Fiero. I'm sorry, sir,

02:07.750 --> 02:11.420
- but I don't see it--
- Look again. I should
be on there.

02:11.420 --> 02:14.000
I knew the boy's
grandfather.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.620
Hm. Fiero.
There it is.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.380
Don't know how I missed it.

02:18.380 --> 02:20.670
It happens to
the best of us,
young man.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.670
Does this look
crooked to you?

02:24.670 --> 02:27.670
All guests are present
and accounted for,
Crown Princess.

02:27.670 --> 02:31.790
It's just a party, Gabe,
not a military exercise.

02:31.790 --> 02:33.420
You can relax.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.830
This is relaxed.

02:35.830 --> 02:37.830
Are you sure Mateo is
royal wizard material?

02:37.830 --> 02:40.170
He seems a little young.

02:40.170 --> 02:42.790
And you seem young to be
a royal guard,

02:42.790 --> 02:44.620
but here you are.

02:44.620 --> 02:46.580
Let's make it official,
shall we?

02:49.380 --> 02:51.620
Mateo!

02:51.620 --> 02:54.170
Mateo! It's Mommy!

02:54.170 --> 02:56.000
Okay, Mom.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.540
Please stop.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.620
Stand up straight.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.670
Mateo de Alma,

03:03.670 --> 03:06.460
by unanimous vote of
the Grand Council,

03:06.460 --> 03:11.830
I hereby appoint you
royal wizard of Avalor.

03:11.830 --> 03:15.790
I am honored
to serve the kingdom.

03:15.790 --> 03:18.880
And I am honored
to present you with this.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.580
It was your grandfather's.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.670
He would have been so proud
to see you wear this.

03:29.670 --> 03:33.210
Oh.

03:33.210 --> 03:35.380
Our new royal wizard,
everyone.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.670
That's my son.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.790
Refreshments will now
be served,

03:44.790 --> 03:46.830
followed by a display
of enchantment

03:46.830 --> 03:50.250
from the royal wizard
himself.

03:50.250 --> 03:55.000
Followed by
an even bigger surprise.

03:56.830 --> 03:59.580
Mateo. Mateo?

04:01.830 --> 04:05.080
Have either of you
seen Mateo?

04:05.080 --> 04:06.620
It's time for
his performance.

04:06.620 --> 04:09.210
Maybe he made himself
disappear.

04:09.210 --> 04:11.420
Not helping, Naomi.

04:11.420 --> 04:12.750
I'll find him.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.170
I'll look, too.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.750
Thanks.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.920
Mor... toloz...

04:18.920 --> 04:21.420
jaqirando!

04:23.790 --> 04:25.250
I did it.

04:28.170 --> 04:30.620
Mateo?

04:30.620 --> 04:33.290
- Just practicing.

04:33.290 --> 04:36.210
Well, it's time to go
out there and show 'em
what you got.

04:36.210 --> 04:40.500
I know, but what if
what I got isn't enough?

04:40.500 --> 04:43.670
I mean, royal wizards
are supposed to be old and wise,

04:43.670 --> 04:46.790
have long beards
and robes that fit.

04:46.790 --> 04:50.210
Your grandfather
was young once, too.

04:50.210 --> 04:52.460
But he knew
so much more than me.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.710
I only have
a few spell books,

04:53.710 --> 04:55.380
and I only know
half the spells.

04:55.380 --> 04:58.330
You're still learning.
So am I.

04:58.330 --> 05:01.540
- But it's not just about
how many spells you know.

05:01.540 --> 05:05.670
No. It's about something
much more powerful.

05:05.670 --> 05:09.670
So listen up, 'cause I'm
only gonna sing this once.

Uh, Mateo.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.880
You might need these.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.830
Oh.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.670
Locked.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.080
Where is it?

07:44.080 --> 07:46.040
Can I help you, sir?

07:46.040 --> 07:48.170
I doubt it.

07:48.170 --> 07:50.250
The party's in
the throne room.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.960
Yes, but I'm not here
for the party.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.710
Akatok!

07:57.670 --> 08:01.290
Looks like I'll need
a change of plan.

08:02.670 --> 08:04.330
Okay, I think I'm ready.

08:04.330 --> 08:06.880
- There you are.
- Everyone's waiting.

08:09.670 --> 08:10.620
Black tamborito.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.500
- It's malvago.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.920
Ximocu!

08:20.040 --> 08:22.250
Stay down, princess.
I'll clear the perimeter.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.620
- Ow!

08:24.620 --> 08:26.710
I think the dome
collapsed.

08:26.710 --> 08:28.790
- I was trying to protect you.

08:28.790 --> 08:30.460
By nearly crushing us?

08:30.460 --> 08:32.790
Okay, that part
wasn't supposed to happen.

08:32.790 --> 08:34.120
but there was a malvago.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.670
- An evil wizard.

08:35.670 --> 08:38.080
He was trying to cast
a spell on us.

08:38.080 --> 08:41.670
There's no way an evil wizard
could've gotten in the palace.

08:41.670 --> 08:43.670
I checked everyone.

08:43.670 --> 08:45.250
Well, there's only one
way to find out.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.710
We have to get out of here.

08:46.710 --> 08:48.620
- I might have a spell--
- Save it.

08:48.620 --> 08:50.960
I can handle this.

08:53.210 --> 08:56.460
Hm. After you.

08:56.460 --> 08:59.710
Guys, look.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.620
Abuelo

09:08.620 --> 09:10.580
Mama?

09:10.580 --> 09:13.330
They're all... statues?

09:16.120 --> 09:17.670
Uh-oh.

09:21.830 --> 09:23.460
What did you do to them?

09:23.460 --> 09:26.290
It wasn't me.
It was the malvago.

09:26.290 --> 09:28.670
Mateo, can you undo
the spell?

09:28.670 --> 09:30.620
Maybe we should hold off
on the magic

09:30.620 --> 09:31.790
until we know
he didn't do it.

09:31.790 --> 09:34.330
Mateo knows
what he's doing, Gabe.

09:34.330 --> 09:36.670
It doesn't matter.
I don't know any spells

09:36.670 --> 09:39.290
powerful enough to undo
this kind of magic.

09:39.290 --> 09:41.830
There must be something in
one of your spell books.

09:41.830 --> 09:43.880
This is just
my grandfather's notebook.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.620
He had some beginner spells,
but that's it.

09:45.620 --> 09:48.210
The kind of magic we need
can only be found

09:48.210 --> 09:50.880
- in the Codex Maru.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.670
It's an ancient Muruvian
spell book

09:52.670 --> 09:55.960
passed down through
generations of royal wizards.

09:55.960 --> 09:59.460
It contains the most ancient
and powerful magic
in the kingdom.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.580
Yes, yes, yes.
Where is it?

10:01.580 --> 10:03.670
That's great.
So where is it?

10:03.670 --> 10:06.170
According to the notebook,
it's hidden somewhere

10:06.170 --> 10:08.790
in the palace
in a secret chamber.

10:08.790 --> 10:11.040
We have to find it, Mateo.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.250
It won't be easy.
My grandfather wanted
to make sure the Codex

10:14.250 --> 10:15.750
didn't fall into
the wrong hands.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.460
All he left was a clue.

10:17.460 --> 10:19.420
Actually, it's more
like a riddle.

10:19.420 --> 10:21.670
Maybe not a riddle.
More like a test.

10:21.670 --> 10:25.540
Like multiple choice,
true or false, guess who.

10:25.540 --> 10:27.830
Just read it!
- All right. Sorry.

10:27.830 --> 10:30.830
- Okay, it says...

10:33.620 --> 10:36.250
MATEO: That's the malvago.

10:36.250 --> 10:38.920
Fiero's the malvago?
He said he was a friend
of your grandfather's.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.420
Friend? That's
his worst enemy.

10:41.420 --> 10:42.830
And you let him in?

10:42.830 --> 10:44.830
He was on the list.

10:44.830 --> 10:46.580
Look, everyone stay put.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.170
I'll get him.

10:48.170 --> 10:50.460
No, wait.
Llevaluq!

10:52.250 --> 10:54.920
What are you doing?
Put me down!

10:54.920 --> 10:57.620
He'll turn you to stone
like the others.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.330
My mom told me the story.

10:59.330 --> 11:01.710
Fiero was in line
to become royal wizard,

11:01.710 --> 11:04.750
but the king appointed
my grandfather instead.

11:04.750 --> 11:08.000
Fiero ran off to become
a malvago, vowing revenge.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.290
This must be his revenge.

11:10.290 --> 11:12.420
Not if we find
the Codex Maru

11:12.420 --> 11:13.830
and undo that spell.

11:13.830 --> 11:15.580
Didn't you say
there was a clue in that book?

11:15.580 --> 11:17.670
Yes. Hang on.
Hang on.

11:17.670 --> 11:18.750
It's right...

11:18.750 --> 11:21.250
Um, I'm still up here.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.960
Oh, right.
Bajaluq.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.290
Ow.

11:25.290 --> 11:26.670
Here it is.

11:26.670 --> 11:28.380
"If you wish
to complete this task,

11:28.380 --> 11:31.670
a wizard most royal
must simply ask."

11:33.380 --> 11:35.120
I've been trying to
figure that out for a while.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.170
Once, I even tried asking
the notebook

11:37.170 --> 11:39.040
where the Codex was.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.620
You talked to a book?
- I know.

11:42.620 --> 11:45.620
- But you weren't a wizard
most royal then.
- I don't follow.

11:45.620 --> 11:49.040
Maybe a wizard most royal
means a royal wizard,

11:49.040 --> 11:52.120
which you weren't until tonight.
Ask it again.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.380
Uh, book...

11:54.380 --> 11:58.380
where can I find
the Codex Maru?

12:03.670 --> 12:04.830
What does it say?

12:04.830 --> 12:06.250
I think it's another riddle.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.250
"To find the book
of which you speak,

12:08.250 --> 12:11.670
there are three keys
which you must seek.

12:11.670 --> 12:13.830
Time will tell
how much you know.

12:13.830 --> 12:17.000
You'll find key one
three hours ago."

12:17.000 --> 12:18.620
What is up with
all the riddles?

12:18.620 --> 12:22.580
It's a test to make
sure whoever gets
the Codex is worthy.

12:22.580 --> 12:25.170
How can we find something
three hours ago,

12:25.170 --> 12:26.670
unless you have
a time travel spell.

12:26.670 --> 12:29.000
No, and I don't think
that's what it means.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.420
But I don't know.

12:30.420 --> 12:33.080
Time will tell,
time will tell.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.790
How do we tell time?

12:34.790 --> 12:36.960
Well, when the big hand
is on the hour...

12:36.960 --> 12:39.170
Of course!
The clock!

12:40.960 --> 12:43.210
- I need a lift.

12:43.210 --> 12:45.120
So I can make it
three hours ago.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.620
A little higher.

12:47.620 --> 12:49.250
( straining,
bones cracking )

12:52.830 --> 12:55.170
One hour, two hours.

12:55.170 --> 12:57.540
Could you hurry?

12:57.540 --> 12:58.750
Three.

12:58.750 --> 13:00.210
Huh?

13:02.750 --> 13:04.710
That's key number one!

13:04.710 --> 13:05.880
What about
the other two?

13:05.880 --> 13:07.830
Guys, look.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.250
"When you play
this melody,

13:09.250 --> 13:12.620
the second key
is way off-key."

13:12.620 --> 13:13.880
Off

13:13.880 --> 13:15.460
You know, like
your singing.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.500
- Hey!
- Hmmm.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.620
The riddle
is about music.

13:19.620 --> 13:21.790
We keep all the instruments
in the music room,

13:21.790 --> 13:23.790
so maybe the key is there.
Come on!

13:25.580 --> 13:27.670
The riddle said
play a melody.

13:27.670 --> 13:29.830
And key could mean
piano keys.

13:29.830 --> 13:32.040
You're right!
Now that I think about it,

13:32.040 --> 13:34.290
there was always a key
that was off-key.

13:34.290 --> 13:36.710
But which one
was it?

13:36.710 --> 13:38.040
Here. Let me try.

13:40.170 --> 13:43.290
- Sounds off-key to me.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.170
But where's the key
we're looking for?

13:48.960 --> 13:51.420
I think I'm getting
the hang of these riddles.

13:51.420 --> 13:54.210
- Maybe I should be
the royal wizard.
- No.

13:54.210 --> 13:55.960
The next riddle
is appearing.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.830
"In the proper
frame of mind,

13:57.830 --> 14:01.380
the third key
you will surely find.

14:01.380 --> 14:02.920
Once you've gotten
all three keys,

14:02.920 --> 14:05.120
unlock the three
mysteries."

14:05.120 --> 14:07.040
Hm.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.000
Well, Gabe,
you're the riddle master.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.290
I don't know, but I'm
still one ahead of him.

14:12.290 --> 14:14.080
- Gabe.
- He's right.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.670
I should know
how to solve these.

14:15.670 --> 14:17.420
That's the whole point--

14:17.420 --> 14:19.210
to prove I'm worthy
of the Codex.

14:19.210 --> 14:21.710
No. The point is
to get the Codex

14:21.710 --> 14:23.210
and save our families.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.380
How we do it
doesn't matter.

14:25.380 --> 14:26.880
Oh, I know what
the three mysteries are.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.040
I see them out my window
every morning.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.620
You know those three
big islands on Avalor Bay?

14:31.620 --> 14:33.880
They're called
the Three Mysteries.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.040
So now we have to sail
out on the bay?

14:36.040 --> 14:39.420
No. The riddle said
proper frame of mind.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.620
What if it means
the frame of a painting?

14:42.620 --> 14:44.580
Come on!

14:44.580 --> 14:46.380
I am so lost.

14:49.830 --> 14:52.790
There. The Three Mysteries
of Avalor Bay.

14:52.790 --> 14:54.120
Check the frame.

15:01.210 --> 15:03.790
Found it!
The third key.

15:03.790 --> 15:05.670
- We use the three keys

15:05.670 --> 15:07.880
to unlock
the three mysteries.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.330
Whatever that means.

15:09.330 --> 15:11.750
Well, the mysteries
are the islands.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.670
Maybe there's
something there.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.620
See that weird
little cave?

15:17.620 --> 15:20.460
I think it kinda
looks like...

15:20.460 --> 15:23.670
a keyhole!
Check the other islands.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.040
- Here's another.
- Here's the third one.

15:28.040 --> 15:30.080
That's how we unlock
the mysteries.

15:54.670 --> 15:56.960
This isn't just
a hiding place.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.790
It's a full-blown
wizard's workshop.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.880
There it is.

16:11.460 --> 16:14.120
The Codex Maru.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.670
Aha! Found it.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.420
Okay, the good news is,

16:18.420 --> 16:20.120
I found the statue spell
in the Codex,

16:20.120 --> 16:21.920
and there's
a reversal potion.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.290
What's the bad news?

16:23.290 --> 16:24.620
It says if we don't
undo the spell

16:24.620 --> 16:27.750
by the next sunrise,
it'll become permanent.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.670
- It's okay, though.

16:29.670 --> 16:31.420
I think I have
all the ingredients here.

16:31.420 --> 16:34.460
You think?
Do you even know
what this stuff is?

16:34.460 --> 16:36.620
Yes. Well, most of it.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.170
Ugh! You should've let me
go after Fiero.

16:39.170 --> 16:41.080
Look, this is
our only chance.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.920
So if you don't mind,
I have a potion to make.

16:46.750 --> 16:50.540
All right.
Extract of whistle weed.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.670
That's it... I think.

16:58.670 --> 17:00.790
Great, because
we're running out of time.

17:00.790 --> 17:02.710
- We have to hurry.
- Let's go.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.080
Fiero!

17:09.080 --> 17:10.670
The Codex,
give it to me.

17:10.670 --> 17:12.620
So that's what
you're here for.

17:12.620 --> 17:15.670
And you lovely children
have led me right to it.

17:15.670 --> 17:16.880
So hand it over.

17:18.250 --> 17:21.120
Ah, the new royal wizard.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.250
What makes you think
you can stop me?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.620
I did it before
on the balcony.

17:25.620 --> 17:28.000
Are you sure about that,
or did I let you escape

17:28.000 --> 17:30.750
so you could lead me
to the Codex?

17:30.750 --> 17:31.710
What?

17:31.710 --> 17:33.670
You can stop him,
Mateo.

17:33.670 --> 17:35.420
- Sh!

17:35.420 --> 17:37.250
If I give you the book,
will you leave?

17:37.250 --> 17:38.830
You have my word.

17:38.830 --> 17:41.620
- Mateo.
- It's safer this way.

17:44.170 --> 17:46.500
Smart boy.

17:48.790 --> 17:51.580
It's okay.
We still have the potion.

17:51.580 --> 17:54.000
Ah, yes.
I'll take that, too.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.500
Meyázami!

17:57.710 --> 17:59.580
You said you'd go.

18:00.670 --> 18:01.880
Gabe!

18:03.620 --> 18:05.290
Abracadabra!

18:06.670 --> 18:08.330
Akatok!

18:08.330 --> 18:10.250
Mateo!

18:10.250 --> 18:11.670
Good-bye, princess.

18:11.670 --> 18:13.920
No! Vetzi!

18:17.250 --> 18:18.580
Nice shot.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.620
Canaza!

18:26.620 --> 18:28.500
The potion?
No matter.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.210
I still have
what I came for.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.710
Elena, catch.

18:32.710 --> 18:35.880
You unfreeze them.
I'm going after the Codex.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.250
Ow!

18:46.250 --> 18:48.620
- Oh, sorry.

18:48.620 --> 18:50.790
Mateo's potion just saved
you and Naomi.

18:50.790 --> 18:51.960
It did?

18:51.960 --> 18:53.000
He went after Fiero.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.210
Come on.

18:57.790 --> 18:58.830
Canaza!

19:01.620 --> 19:02.830
Boqato!

19:07.750 --> 19:09.080
Meyázami!

19:13.750 --> 19:14.540
Vetzi!

19:24.210 --> 19:27.670
This will only end
one way, and we both know it.

19:31.710 --> 19:33.080
Canaza!

19:35.080 --> 19:36.710
Look at you.

19:36.710 --> 19:39.040
A boy in
a man's robe.

19:40.920 --> 19:44.830
The princess was foolish to
think you were a royal wizard,

19:44.830 --> 19:47.620
and you were even
more foolish
for believing her.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.710
But you will make
a lovely statue.

19:51.710 --> 19:53.170
- Akatok!
- Ximocu!

19:56.380 --> 19:58.080
Mateo!

19:58.080 --> 20:01.080
Whoa. You turned
him to stone.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.960
You do know
what you're doing.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.620
You did it!

20:04.620 --> 20:06.750
I... I guess I did.

20:06.750 --> 20:09.000
I'm sorry
I doubted you.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.830
Nice work, hero.

20:10.830 --> 20:12.420
Thanks.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.790
Uh, guys,
the sun's coming up.

20:14.790 --> 20:17.460
ELENA: Uh, we have
to undo that spell now.

20:17.460 --> 20:21.000
MATEO: There's not enough time
to drip the potion on everyone.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.710
What do we do?

20:22.710 --> 20:25.540
Gabe, how's
your throwing arm?

20:25.540 --> 20:27.380
Like a cannon.

20:27.380 --> 20:29.620
High as you can...

20:29.620 --> 20:31.790
right in the center
of the room.

20:31.790 --> 20:33.620
You got it!

20:33.620 --> 20:34.710
Solaza!

20:47.790 --> 20:49.750
What... what happened?

20:49.750 --> 20:51.670
How is it morning already?

20:51.670 --> 20:53.210
It is my duty to report

20:53.210 --> 20:55.750
that a malvago
invaded the palace.

20:55.750 --> 20:59.210
but he was defeated by
our new royal wizard.

20:59.210 --> 21:02.750
I believe
this belongs to you.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.580
Huh?

21:18.040 --> 21:20.580
This is why I made you
the royal wizard.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.170
Thank you.

21:22.170 --> 21:24.830
You believed in me when
I didn't even believe in myself.

21:24.830 --> 21:27.080
We make
a pretty good team.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.460
She's right. The kingdom can
sleep a little safer tonight.

21:29.460 --> 21:31.380
Thanks to Mateo.

21:31.380 --> 21:33.620
So, Mateo, are you
ready to show them

21:33.620 --> 21:35.540
what you got now?

21:37.750 --> 21:40.170
Mortoloz jaqirando!

21:44.960 --> 21:47.920
Ooh! Jaquins!
Sparkly.
