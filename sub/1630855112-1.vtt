00:58.375 --> 01:00.708
- Avast, you hornswoggler.

01:00.791 --> 01:05.375
- Avast yourself.
I'll run you through.

01:05.458 --> 01:07.375
I'll tear you limb from limb.

01:17.458 --> 01:18.458
- Hey.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.750
Your time is running out, Peter Pan.

01:25.833 --> 01:28.125
- Peter Pan
doesn't care about time.

01:28.208 --> 01:30.208
Watch out for the crocodile.

01:30.916 --> 01:32.708
- You watch out for the crocodile.

01:32.791 --> 01:36.416
- And, Wendy, please don't wait
to the last minute to pack.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.500
I won't, Mother.

01:37.583 --> 01:40.666
-The train is at 8 o'clock sharp tomorrow.
-Mother, I heard you.

01:40.750 --> 01:41.791
I'll be ready.

01:41.875 --> 01:44.750
- Out of the way, Mother.
Where's that treasure?

01:44.833 --> 01:47.000
Where is it? Aha!

01:47.083 --> 01:48.583
- No, give it back!

01:49.541 --> 01:50.958
John, give it back.

01:52.916 --> 01:54.125
- I've got it!

01:57.333 --> 01:58.375
I've got the treasure.

01:58.458 --> 01:59.875
-I've got the treasure.

01:59.958 --> 02:00.958
I've got the treasure.

02:07.041 --> 02:08.041
- Got you.

02:10.916 --> 02:11.916
Where is it?

02:14.500 --> 02:16.416
- Captain Hook,
I'm getting a little tired.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.750
Maybe we can take a break?

02:17.833 --> 02:21.041
- Are you forfeiting?
Are you giving up?

02:39.791 --> 02:44.125
I've got you cornered, Peter.
Your Lost Boys are nowhere to be seen.

02:44.208 --> 02:46.083
No one will save you now!

02:49.083 --> 02:52.333
You're not forgetting about me, are you?
Michael, give me your treasure.

02:53.583 --> 02:55.000
Now leave Hook to me.

02:56.208 --> 02:59.458
Make way, Captain, lest I run you through!

03:00.833 --> 03:02.458
Go, Wendy!

03:03.916 --> 03:05.083
-Come on, Wendy.

03:06.291 --> 03:07.291
- Go, Wendy.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.250
- Don't hurt him!

03:11.916 --> 03:13.375
-You giving up, Captain?
-- No.

03:14.583 --> 03:16.333
-No, you're just...

03:20.750 --> 03:21.875
- What was that?

03:27.833 --> 03:28.875
Not again.

03:31.333 --> 03:32.958
Who's responsible for this?

03:35.083 --> 03:37.333
-Wendy?
-John, you tattletale!

03:37.416 --> 03:39.500
-I didn't say anything.
-It wasn't my fault!

03:39.583 --> 03:41.291
-It was their silly game!
-Now, now.

03:41.375 --> 03:43.708
-And they started it, it wasn't me!
-Enough!

03:43.791 --> 03:44.791
Sword.

03:47.250 --> 03:48.875
Sword, hats.

03:52.958 --> 03:54.083
Nana.

03:54.166 --> 03:56.333
Father, can't she just stay
for a little while?

03:56.416 --> 03:57.416
No, she cannot.

03:58.541 --> 04:02.291
Honestly, Wendy, is this how you want
to spend your last night at home?

04:02.375 --> 04:04.875
-It was just a bit of fun.
-Exactly.

04:05.625 --> 04:10.208
You are too old for this
to be the type of fun that you are having.

04:13.208 --> 04:15.000
Nana. Come on.

04:19.291 --> 04:22.125
Wendy, why did you say that?

04:22.833 --> 04:24.500
Why did you say it was our fault?

04:24.583 --> 04:28.000
You're a pirate, aren't you?
It's every man for himself.

04:45.208 --> 04:46.416
They suit you, Wendy.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.791
You should take them with you.

04:54.583 --> 04:55.583
I'd rather not.

05:00.916 --> 05:02.958
- Come along, boys, into bed.

05:08.166 --> 05:10.583
-It wasn't my fault.
-I know, John.

05:13.125 --> 05:16.416
Mother, why does Captain Hook
hate Peter Pan?

05:17.333 --> 05:21.583
- That's a very good question,
one that we will have to ponder,

05:22.458 --> 05:23.666
tomorrow.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.083
Wendy.

05:26.666 --> 05:27.666
May I come in?

05:31.625 --> 05:35.000
You really must set a better example
for your brothers.

05:35.791 --> 05:37.708
They look up to you so much.

05:37.791 --> 05:39.500
That's what they have you for.

05:39.583 --> 05:41.750
They need me to be their mother

05:41.833 --> 05:43.708
and your father to be their father.

05:43.791 --> 05:46.625
But they need you to be their big sister.

05:47.958 --> 05:50.375
You give them something
that neither of us can.

05:51.166 --> 05:54.500
They will follow your lead,
so you must be a good leader.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.958
How am I supposed to do that
if I'm off at boarding school, Mother?

06:00.250 --> 06:02.333
By going with your head held high

06:03.083 --> 06:04.166
to start with.

06:05.125 --> 06:10.125
If a young lady is lucky enough,
at a certain age, she goes off to school.

06:10.791 --> 06:13.041
To get ready for the life ahead of her.

06:13.125 --> 06:15.291
What if I don't want that life?

06:15.833 --> 06:17.958
It's what I did when I was your age.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.041
What if I don't want your life?

06:31.083 --> 06:33.833
What is it that you're afraid of, my love?

06:34.958 --> 06:36.958
I want things to stay the way they are.

06:38.291 --> 06:39.500
- The way they are?

06:41.041 --> 06:44.541
Wendy, look, you scarcely fit in your bed.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.083
You're growing up.

06:49.875 --> 06:51.541
Perhaps, I don't want to grow up.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.541
You can't stop time, Wendy.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.916
It'll march on whether you like it or not.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.625
Just imagine all the things
you would miss out on,

07:04.791 --> 07:06.416
if you didn't see where it took you.

07:08.041 --> 07:10.458
And all the things the world would miss

07:11.875 --> 07:13.750
if you weren't there to do them.

07:19.375 --> 07:24.458
It's time to drift away, my loves

07:25.375 --> 07:31.791
And dream of cooing turtle doves

07:32.625 --> 07:38.541
For when I turn to switch the light

07:39.000 --> 07:45.625
I know you'll grow up overnight

07:47.416 --> 07:53.166
Fly off into the cloudless skies

07:53.958 --> 08:00.500
Where twinkling stars will fill your eyes

08:01.583 --> 08:08.583
I'll miss you dearly
My brave little ones

08:10.833 --> 08:17.833
All grown up now in the morning sun

09:51.541 --> 09:53.250
-- Gotcha!

09:55.125 --> 09:57.125
I can't... What was happening?

09:58.708 --> 09:59.958
Was I dreaming?

10:00.041 --> 10:01.708
You were flying.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.250
- How?

10:03.791 --> 10:05.250
A little bug did it.

10:10.375 --> 10:11.583
I don't think that's a bug.

10:13.041 --> 10:14.916
- Well, it's a... It's a...

10:16.708 --> 10:18.291
- She is a fairy.

10:19.333 --> 10:21.041
And if I know one thing about fairies,

10:21.125 --> 10:23.125
it's they don't take kindly
to being called bugs.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.750
-- Are you...
-Peter Pan?

10:27.916 --> 10:29.833
Were you expecting someone else?

10:29.916 --> 10:32.416
We weren't expecting anyone at all.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.083
They always act so surprised.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.833
I always envisioned you as being...

10:35.916 --> 10:37.708
-Taller?
-No, smaller actually.

10:40.833 --> 10:43.916
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
that's not what I meant.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.416
I'm... Well... I... How are you real?

10:49.041 --> 10:50.750
I thought you were just a bedtime story.

10:50.833 --> 10:51.833
Why can't I be both?

10:53.625 --> 10:55.541
I like hearing stories about myself.

10:55.625 --> 10:57.833
And your mother's very good
at telling them.

10:57.916 --> 10:59.125
Now, let's see here.

10:59.208 --> 11:01.708
Excuse me, you can't just
go through all our stuff.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.000
- Where are you hiding?

11:06.166 --> 11:07.750
- Oh please, be careful.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.333
This is very delicate.

11:09.416 --> 11:11.000
What are you doing here?

11:11.083 --> 11:13.208
One, we've to get you out of here.

11:13.291 --> 11:14.291
And, two...

11:20.083 --> 11:21.083
My shadow.

11:21.166 --> 11:22.708
- Your shadow?

11:22.791 --> 11:24.750
It's trying to get away,
and I've only got one.

11:25.291 --> 11:27.500
You're making this harder
than it has to be.

11:28.166 --> 11:29.166
-- Oh.

11:35.958 --> 11:36.958
There you are.

11:46.875 --> 11:47.875
- Oh.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.041
- Got it.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.500
Lights out, shadow.

11:55.291 --> 11:56.875
- Get it, Peter, get it.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.041
Oh, almost got it!

12:03.458 --> 12:05.291
-There it is.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.208
Your hat! I've got your hat!

12:10.125 --> 12:11.125
Go, go, go!

12:12.375 --> 12:13.375
- Ha! Got you!

12:14.750 --> 12:17.458
When will you learn you can't get
anywhere without me, old friend.

12:18.458 --> 12:20.083
No, that time doesn't count.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.416
-Hold still.
-- Maybe I could help you with that.

12:33.125 --> 12:34.875
Here. Let me see.

12:41.166 --> 12:43.583
It's okay, Tink. Wendy wouldn't hurt me.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.208
-Can't she speak?
-Of course, she can.

12:48.291 --> 12:50.166
You just haven't learnt to hear her right.

12:52.083 --> 12:54.166
Well, you're very small, Tinker Bell.

12:56.791 --> 12:59.666
-What's she saying?
-She says "All fairies are small.

12:59.750 --> 13:02.041
-"That's what makes them fairies."
-Oh.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.250
How'd you know my name, Peter Pan?

13:10.333 --> 13:11.708
I heard your mother call you.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.166
-"Wendy, time to wake up," she says.
-Time to wake up.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.416
-"Wendy, time for school."
-Wendy, time for school.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.125
-"Wendy, bedtime."
-Wendy, bedtime.

13:18.791 --> 13:20.416
But you never want to go.

13:21.916 --> 13:23.416
You've been watching me?

13:23.500 --> 13:25.250
-Sometimes.
-Why?

13:25.333 --> 13:27.208
Because I've been waiting
for you to say it.

13:27.291 --> 13:30.416
-Say what?
-Same thing I said, once upon a time.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.791
I don't want to grow... Ow!

13:31.875 --> 13:33.875
-Ow! Ow!
-I was only...

13:33.958 --> 13:36.000
You stabbed me.
You stabbed me in the heart.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.625
Your heart is in your foot?

13:38.416 --> 13:39.416
- Isn't yours?

13:39.500 --> 13:43.875
When Mr. Bear gets hurt,
Mama gives him a kiss to make it better.

13:43.958 --> 13:45.750
What's a kiss?

13:45.833 --> 13:47.291
You don't know what a kiss is?

13:47.375 --> 13:49.541
No, but I think I need one.

13:51.250 --> 13:52.458
Well, I...

13:53.541 --> 13:54.541
No.

13:55.416 --> 13:56.416
Um...

14:02.666 --> 14:03.750
This is a kiss.

14:10.416 --> 14:13.125
I like it. I like it very much.

14:13.791 --> 14:14.791
Now, do you feel better?

14:15.625 --> 14:17.041
Yes. Good as new.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.250
-What's she saying?

14:19.916 --> 14:22.291
- That it's high time we go.
- Go where?

14:22.375 --> 14:26.208
To one place in the entire universe
where you can really be yourself.

14:26.291 --> 14:30.333
Where there are no rules, no schools,
no bedtimes, no mothers and fathers,

14:30.416 --> 14:32.208
-and most of all...
-No growing up.

14:32.291 --> 14:33.916
That most of all.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.083
Oh, you are you talking about Neverland?

14:36.166 --> 14:37.541
Surely, we couldn't there though?

14:37.625 --> 14:40.375
-Of course, you could.
-But how do you get there?

14:40.458 --> 14:42.458
That's... the fun part.

14:52.666 --> 14:55.083
This suddenly seems like a terrible idea.

14:59.916 --> 15:01.916
I've always dreamed of flying.

15:02.833 --> 15:05.041
It's the easiest thing in the world.

15:05.125 --> 15:08.250
All you have to do, is fill your head
with happy thoughts.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.333
- That's it?

15:11.125 --> 15:13.791
Oh, right. And a little pixie dust.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.708
What is it?

15:20.416 --> 15:21.416
What are you saying?

15:28.083 --> 15:29.916
You want me to close my eyes?

15:31.583 --> 15:32.583
All right.

15:40.583 --> 15:41.791
- What are you thinking of?

15:41.875 --> 15:43.000
Of when I was little.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.208
When I was happy.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.125
About how things used to be.

15:55.583 --> 15:57.416
- Now, open your eyes.

16:03.750 --> 16:05.125
- Whoa.

16:07.958 --> 16:10.166
No, no. I'm not ready yet.
I still...

16:12.291 --> 16:14.500
- Are you certain this is safe?
- Of course it is.

16:14.583 --> 16:15.916
I haven't fallen yet.

16:16.541 --> 16:17.541
I can fly?

16:18.250 --> 16:19.583
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

16:23.041 --> 16:25.166
- I can fly!

16:33.875 --> 16:35.416
- Goodbye, Nana!

17:21.666 --> 17:22.666
- Yay!

17:23.750 --> 17:24.750
I'm flying!

17:25.458 --> 17:26.500
- Yay!

17:45.083 --> 17:46.333
- There it is!

17:46.416 --> 17:49.083
Second star to the right
and straight on 'til morning.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.416
- Look!

18:40.500 --> 18:41.583
I see it!

18:42.750 --> 18:44.375
-Is that...
-Neverland!

19:12.041 --> 19:13.458
- Wait for us, Wendy!

19:14.416 --> 19:16.541
- Is this everything
you've dreamed of?

19:16.625 --> 19:18.291
- I could never have dreamed of this!

19:18.375 --> 19:20.250
- Come on, there's more!

19:55.041 --> 19:57.125
- Oh. Oh, no!

19:57.750 --> 19:59.333
Oh, no!

20:09.750 --> 20:10.750
He's back!

20:11.208 --> 20:12.666
Hey!

20:12.750 --> 20:16.166
Get your eyes to the sky!
The boy! He's back!

20:26.875 --> 20:27.875
- Yes, what?

20:27.958 --> 20:32.250
Uh, it's the boy, Captain.
It's Peter Pa...

20:40.708 --> 20:41.791
Never...

20:42.500 --> 20:43.500
say...

20:45.166 --> 20:46.291
his name.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.041
Sorry, Captain.

20:54.208 --> 20:55.375
- Mr. Smee.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.500
Smee,

20:59.916 --> 21:01.875
make a note. My cabin needs a new door.

21:02.375 --> 21:05.166
A new door. Yes. Uh, right.

21:05.833 --> 21:10.416
Might I say, Captain, uh,
that will be your third door this month.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.833
And it won't be the last.

21:11.916 --> 21:13.125
Where's my telescope?

21:14.625 --> 21:16.375
Telescope! Smee.

21:17.250 --> 21:18.625
Telescope at hand, Captain.

21:20.875 --> 21:23.833
Speak not to me of hands, Smee.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.083
Oh, I see your point. Uh...

21:30.833 --> 21:32.833
- Where is he, then?
- Over there, Captain.

21:36.458 --> 21:37.458
- There you are.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.083
Footloose and flying free.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.125
But not for long.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.333
What'd you have us do, Captain?

21:48.291 --> 21:52.125
Why, let's invite him down
for a spot of tea.

21:52.208 --> 21:53.958
Tea. Excellent idea.

21:54.666 --> 21:57.666
Hear that boys? Put the kettle on.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.250
It's tea time!

22:15.791 --> 22:16.791
There. Look.

22:16.875 --> 22:18.000
Yeah.

22:23.666 --> 22:24.666
What was that?

22:25.083 --> 22:26.250
Pirates. Come on.

22:30.458 --> 22:31.458
Come on, Michael!

22:44.041 --> 22:45.041
It's Hook!

22:45.666 --> 22:46.666
Captain Hook?

22:46.750 --> 22:49.416
Who else would try to kill me
this early in the morning?

22:49.500 --> 22:51.875
Fire!

23:00.916 --> 23:01.958
Follow me.

23:10.666 --> 23:12.041
Now, listen close.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.208
I'll lead the charge,
you three take up the rear

23:14.291 --> 23:15.750
and we'll storm them, fore to aft.

23:16.166 --> 23:17.416
They'll never see us coming.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.500
Move!

23:19.583 --> 23:23.250
Remember, all pirates are fair game,
but leave Hook...

23:24.125 --> 23:25.125
to me.

23:30.083 --> 23:31.083
Did I hit him?

23:31.833 --> 23:33.250
Well, you hit someone, Captain.

24:13.250 --> 24:14.250
Oh, no.

24:15.166 --> 24:16.208
John?

24:17.458 --> 24:19.000
Michael?

24:22.166 --> 24:23.708
John?

24:23.791 --> 24:25.291
Michael?

24:27.500 --> 24:30.583
Tinker Bell? Can you hear me?

24:31.583 --> 24:32.916
Peter!

24:34.083 --> 24:35.333
Anyone?

24:47.041 --> 24:48.208


24:55.750 --> 24:56.750
- Look!

24:56.833 --> 24:58.416
She has his hat!

24:59.250 --> 25:00.875
What have you done with Peter?

25:00.958 --> 25:03.125
I haven't done anything with Peter.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.541
Where did you all...

25:07.708 --> 25:08.916
Not another move!

25:10.458 --> 25:11.458


25:17.166 --> 25:18.166
Pardon?

25:19.041 --> 25:20.416
Are you the Wendy?

25:23.041 --> 25:24.250
Well, I'm a Wendy.

25:24.333 --> 25:25.916
The Wendy Peter went to find?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
The Wendy who knows the bedtime stories?

25:28.083 --> 25:30.666
'Cause if you don't know stories
then you're an imposter.

25:30.750 --> 25:32.958
And you know what we do with imposters.

25:35.791 --> 25:37.208
Stop doing that!

25:37.291 --> 25:38.291


25:50.375 --> 25:51.375
Are you...

25:52.000 --> 25:53.416
Are you Tiger Lily?

25:53.875 --> 25:55.458


25:55.541 --> 25:56.666
Which means you must be...

25:56.750 --> 25:58.583
-Lost Boys.
-Every last one of us.

25:59.916 --> 26:02.125
-But you're not all boys.
-So?

26:03.041 --> 26:04.666
Well, I guess it doesn't really matter.

26:04.750 --> 26:06.708
What matters is,
what you've done with Peter.

26:06.791 --> 26:07.791
Give me that.

26:08.625 --> 26:10.041
I haven't done anything with him.

26:11.541 --> 26:13.416
He came and collected me and my brothers.

26:13.500 --> 26:14.500
Brothers?

26:14.583 --> 26:16.583
Peter didn't say anything about brothers!

26:16.666 --> 26:18.666
- That's what I've been trying
to tell you all.

26:18.750 --> 26:21.416
We were flying, and then,
we were attacked.

26:21.500 --> 26:22.583
-Attacked?
-Yes.

26:22.666 --> 26:24.125
-By pirates!
-- I knew it.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.875
-I knew it was a bad day to fly.
-- No, you didn't.

26:26.958 --> 26:29.750
-Bellweather, telescope.
-- At all? I didn't say it at all?

26:29.833 --> 26:31.583
-I didn't say it?
-- You did not say it.

26:31.666 --> 26:36.875
- I said it when Peter asked us
to look for... whoever this is... I win.

26:36.958 --> 26:39.000
- You never said it. No.

26:39.083 --> 26:42.000
These brothers of yours,
what do they look like?

26:42.791 --> 26:48.208
Well, John's this tall
and Michael's this tall

26:49.000 --> 26:51.541
and John, he has a hat. He has a top hat.

26:51.625 --> 26:54.666
-Ooh, a hat!
-Yes, but I don't know if he's wearing it.

26:54.750 --> 26:57.583
So, he might be this tall. And...

26:59.125 --> 27:00.375
Does one of them have a bear?

27:00.458 --> 27:02.125
Mr. Bear, yes, that's Michael.

27:04.541 --> 27:06.541
There's definitely pirates, all right.

27:09.583 --> 27:11.291
Well, I don't see anything.

27:14.458 --> 27:17.916
-I don't trust...
-She's too grown up, isn't she?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.250
- Yep, too old.
- Isn't she?

27:26.500 --> 27:28.416
You're just looking the wrong way.

27:39.750 --> 27:44.583
- Oh, I see it! There's John
and Michael and a pirate ship!

27:44.666 --> 27:46.291
And pirates.

27:48.958 --> 27:49.958
Oh, dear!

27:55.416 --> 27:56.541
Come along, lads.

27:56.625 --> 28:00.000
Don't fancy yourselves the first
half-pints to be found afloating.

28:00.083 --> 28:02.083
Well, I rescued the Captain from the sea

28:02.166 --> 28:04.083
when he was scarcely taller
than yourselves.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.083
Of course he weren't captain then.

28:06.166 --> 28:09.041
He didn't have a hook.
He was just a little lost child,

28:09.125 --> 28:11.375
desperate to make it back
to these fine shores

28:11.458 --> 28:13.250
before he got too old to enjoy them.

28:13.333 --> 28:16.041
All right, make some rooms for our guests.
Come on, come on.

28:16.125 --> 28:18.333
Ooh, a fresh catch from the sea.

28:18.416 --> 28:23.166
Hey. That's a fine bear you got there.
Did you kill that yourself?

28:23.250 --> 28:25.375
Don't you touch Mr. Bear!

28:25.458 --> 28:27.208
- Ooh!

28:27.291 --> 28:28.291
Mr. Bear.

28:29.583 --> 28:30.750
Leave him alone!

28:42.708 --> 28:44.750
- What do you have for me, Mr. Smee?

28:45.375 --> 28:47.083
Good tidings, I hope.

28:47.416 --> 28:48.791
No, not today,

28:48.875 --> 28:53.583
but... but we fished these little fellas
out of the drink.

28:53.666 --> 28:59.500
One of them is in possession of a small,
but possibly dangerous, bear.

29:01.250 --> 29:05.666
And all three of them may be compatriots
of you-know-who.

29:20.166 --> 29:21.166
- Shh.

29:22.375 --> 29:23.750
What's that?

29:26.708 --> 29:27.708
Listen.

29:30.916 --> 29:32.333
Do you hear what I hear?

29:34.208 --> 29:36.208
-I don't think so.
-Listen!

29:38.583 --> 29:39.583
Listen.

29:42.250 --> 29:43.458
There it is again.

29:48.333 --> 29:49.333
Teeny.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.125
Tiny.

30:10.708 --> 30:12.333
Oh, that's it.

30:14.916 --> 30:16.041
- Mr. Smee.

30:16.125 --> 30:17.250
Yes, Captain?

30:17.333 --> 30:23.125
What are the rules on my ship?

30:23.208 --> 30:26.791
As they be tattooed on me heart.

30:26.875 --> 30:31.208
One, each pirate upon first embarking
shall be entitled...

30:31.291 --> 30:33.625
Start at 37.

30:33.708 --> 30:36.541
Yes, quite right. Rule 37,

30:37.666 --> 30:40.125
no one shall say the boy's name.

30:40.208 --> 30:42.958
Rule 38, no whistling.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.666
Rule 39...

30:51.041 --> 30:52.041
No...

30:52.833 --> 30:53.833
clocks.

30:55.125 --> 30:56.125
That's it.

30:57.250 --> 30:58.250
- Now,

30:59.166 --> 31:00.208
tell me.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.583
How did you come to Neverland?

31:04.666 --> 31:07.125
-We came with Pe...
-Please don't break the rules!

31:07.875 --> 31:09.208
Do not say his name.

31:09.291 --> 31:12.416
We don't care about your rules.
We came with Peter Pan.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.875
And he's gonna rescue us.

31:15.958 --> 31:17.500
He said his name.

31:17.583 --> 31:19.958
Dibs on the bear after he executes them.

31:24.916 --> 31:26.541
He's going to rescue you?

31:27.208 --> 31:29.208
Well... Probably.

31:30.375 --> 31:31.791
Hopefully.

31:35.458 --> 31:36.458
- Hope.

31:37.416 --> 31:39.250
Most days, I hate that word.

31:41.250 --> 31:42.458
But on this occasion...

31:46.583 --> 31:47.583
I wonder.

31:49.083 --> 31:50.083
Mr. Smee.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
MR.- Yes, Cap?

31:53.833 --> 31:55.458
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

31:55.541 --> 31:59.000
-The plank.
-He's gonna make them walk the plank.

31:59.583 --> 32:01.791
-That a cup of tea'd be nice right now.
-No.

32:05.541 --> 32:07.625
- Rouse yourselves, lads.

32:09.625 --> 32:10.833
Set a course

32:11.541 --> 32:12.750
for Skull Rock.

32:16.500 --> 32:19.208
Heave ho, Heave ho

32:19.291 --> 32:21.875
-Heave ho
-Dark and quiet are the devils in the deep

32:21.958 --> 32:24.208
So slow and silent
So you're swallowed in your sleep

32:24.291 --> 32:26.500
With a tail and a tooth
And I'm telling you the truth

32:26.583 --> 32:29.041
You'll be boiling in the belly
Of a behemoth

32:29.125 --> 32:31.583
- They're headed to Skull Rock.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.375
Just as I feared.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.166
Wonder why they call it...

32:38.041 --> 32:39.125
Oh, my...

32:43.041 --> 32:45.375
- There's only one reason
pirates go to Skull Rock.

32:46.208 --> 32:47.500
An execution is nigh.

32:47.583 --> 32:49.125
An execution?

32:49.208 --> 32:51.958
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's go rescue them.

32:53.125 --> 32:54.125
Dark and quiet are the devils in the deep

32:54.208 --> 32:56.541
So slow and silent
So you're swallowed in your sleep

32:56.625 --> 32:58.916
With a tail and a tooth
And I'm telling you the truth

32:59.000 --> 33:00.833
You'll be boiling in the belly
Of a behemoth

33:00.916 --> 33:01.916


33:02.791 --> 33:04.125
...your sights abroad

33:04.208 --> 33:06.250
And suddenly the suction of a cephalopod

33:06.333 --> 33:08.750
Has you thinking twice take my advice

33:08.833 --> 33:11.500
A mutineer should also fear a firing squad

33:11.583 --> 33:14.875
Ho!

33:21.333 --> 33:22.875
Ho!

33:26.375 --> 33:29.333
You can get anywhere
in Neverland down here.

33:29.416 --> 33:30.625
If you know the way.

33:30.708 --> 33:34.541
It's particularly useful
when you wanna hide from pirates.

33:34.625 --> 33:36.083
Which is my preference.

33:36.166 --> 33:38.000
Why is Captain Hook so hateful?

33:38.083 --> 33:40.625
- Because he grew up.
- And grew up wrong.

33:40.708 --> 33:43.666
-But he's still the best swordsman.
-Which also makes him...

33:43.750 --> 33:46.041
-The worst.
-Which is why we leave him to Peter.

33:46.125 --> 33:49.291
Who he hates
because Peter cut off his hand.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.750
Fed it to the crocodile.
Well, along with his watch.

33:51.833 --> 33:54.916
-You know about the crocodile?
-That's how the story goes.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.708
Wait, you mean I'm in a story?

33:57.791 --> 33:59.041
- Shh!

34:15.750 --> 34:16.750
Don't look at that.

34:19.916 --> 34:21.125
- Oh, no.

34:22.166 --> 34:23.166
Poor Robert.

34:25.916 --> 34:27.541
- Oh, look, there they are.

34:27.625 --> 34:29.666
For goodness sakes, Michael can't swim.

34:37.250 --> 34:38.250
Captain.

34:42.500 --> 34:43.500
Oops.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.375
Tide's rising.

34:49.125 --> 34:51.041
Poor little cast aways.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.291
Tell me.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.625
What will you hold on to?

34:57.875 --> 34:58.875
Your hope?

35:00.958 --> 35:02.125
Or your breath?

35:02.208 --> 35:03.208
You can't kill us.

35:03.875 --> 35:06.041
-We've done nothing wrong.
-Oh, yes you have.

35:06.125 --> 35:07.291
You're doing it right now.

35:08.833 --> 35:11.458
I've found you guilty of being a child,

35:12.583 --> 35:15.041
and we can't have children...

35:15.958 --> 35:16.958
in Neverland.

35:17.041 --> 35:21.125
Rule 44, no children in Neverland.

35:21.208 --> 35:23.583
- No children in Neverland

35:23.666 --> 35:25.875
- No children in Neverland

35:25.958 --> 35:28.333
- No children in Neverland

35:28.416 --> 35:30.791
No children in Neverland

35:30.875 --> 35:33.333
No children in Neverland

35:33.416 --> 35:35.708
No children in Neverland

35:35.791 --> 35:38.541
No children in Neverland

35:38.625 --> 35:41.541
No children in Neverland

35:41.625 --> 35:44.083
- No one but children in Neverland

35:44.166 --> 35:46.625
No one but children in Neverland

35:47.000 --> 35:49.083
No one but children in Neverland

35:49.625 --> 35:52.250
No one but children in Neverland

35:52.333 --> 35:54.583
No one but children in Neverland

35:55.041 --> 35:57.166
No one but children in Neverland

35:57.250 --> 35:59.500
Quiet!

35:59.583 --> 36:01.250
...in Neverland

36:04.583 --> 36:05.583
You.

36:07.208 --> 36:08.208
What is your name?

36:09.166 --> 36:11.375
How long have you served on my ship?

36:15.125 --> 36:17.750
Hey. Answer your captain.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Fake beard.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.541
I've got to say,
it's not half bad being a pirate.

36:35.625 --> 36:36.666
Pan!

36:38.250 --> 36:39.583
It's far better being me.

36:55.875 --> 36:57.416
Mr. Bear!

37:00.666 --> 37:02.000
Oh, he's just showing off.

37:02.083 --> 37:04.291
Oh, he's not showing off yet.

37:20.375 --> 37:22.000
Now he's showing off.

37:22.458 --> 37:24.458
Captain Hook.

37:24.541 --> 37:27.125
You're looking a little worse for wear,
old man.

37:27.208 --> 37:29.958
You sure you won't be happier
back in your sick-bed?

37:31.416 --> 37:32.416
Not today, boy.

37:33.291 --> 37:36.291
I woke this morning
with a tune in my heart.

37:39.125 --> 37:40.666
Do you know what the refrain was?

37:42.375 --> 37:44.625
Yo ho, yo hey

37:44.708 --> 37:47.250
Oh, brother. Hook's singing again.

37:47.333 --> 37:49.833
Peter Pan shall perish today

37:50.625 --> 37:54.041
Dark and sinister man.
Prepare to meet thy doom.

37:54.625 --> 37:56.333
Proud and insolent youth.

37:57.833 --> 37:58.833
Have at me!

38:13.625 --> 38:14.625
Come with me.

38:15.125 --> 38:16.125
Trust me.

38:16.583 --> 38:19.375
-- Oh, good morning, Mr. Smee.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.208
Oh, the fairy.

38:53.250 --> 38:54.666
John. Michael.

38:54.750 --> 38:56.583
-- Wendy!
-Shh.

38:56.666 --> 38:58.666
Look what they did to Mr. Bear.

39:01.375 --> 39:02.375
Oh, my...

39:12.208 --> 39:13.291
Yes! Get his hat!

39:19.125 --> 39:20.333
Bad form!

39:25.916 --> 39:27.333
Oh, Tinker Bell. Thank goodness.

39:28.083 --> 39:29.083
Can you help us?

39:33.708 --> 39:34.708
Yes!

39:35.041 --> 39:36.375
Oh, Wendy.

39:37.291 --> 39:38.291
You're still alive!

39:38.375 --> 39:40.958
- Yes, I am and so are you.

39:41.041 --> 39:42.708
I thought that maybe you had...

39:42.791 --> 39:43.833
- Died? Perished?

39:43.916 --> 39:45.166
-Been blown to bits?
-- Yes!

39:45.250 --> 39:48.000
- Not a chance. I'm quite good
at not getting kill...

39:51.625 --> 39:53.625
Got you!

39:55.708 --> 39:58.791
-I beat you.

39:59.958 --> 40:03.666
Don't even think about helping, Tink.

40:06.625 --> 40:07.833
Wretched fairy.

40:08.666 --> 40:10.666
Very bad form, Captain Hook.

40:12.125 --> 40:14.291
All my bad form, I learnt from you.

40:14.833 --> 40:16.041
Don't flatter yourself.

40:16.916 --> 40:18.541
You've always been rotten.

40:18.625 --> 40:22.125
A stinking, rotten codfish.

40:25.750 --> 40:28.375
You've stabbed me in my heart
with your words.

40:29.666 --> 40:31.083
For the last time.

40:33.958 --> 40:37.333
Now, I will repay in kind with my sword.

40:40.583 --> 40:42.875
Strike then, if you've got the courage.

40:44.291 --> 40:45.291
And strike true.

40:47.583 --> 40:48.583
For to die

40:48.666 --> 40:51.875
-will be an awfully big adventure.
-An awfully big adventure.

40:55.666 --> 40:56.875
- Hey, stop!

41:01.041 --> 41:02.041
Who are you?

41:06.208 --> 41:07.833
I've never seen you here before!

41:08.750 --> 41:11.375
-Well, you see, I'm...
-She's a Wendy.

41:11.458 --> 41:12.875
-- A Wendy!
-A Wendy!

41:17.083 --> 41:18.166
- A Wendy?

41:18.958 --> 41:21.166
-What's a Wendy?
-I'm a Wendy.

41:22.041 --> 41:24.333
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

41:24.416 --> 41:29.625
And I am from London, England
where gentlemen do not harm children!

41:32.750 --> 41:34.041
Well.

41:35.166 --> 41:39.083
-I am...
-Captain Hook. I know.

41:40.750 --> 41:43.583
-And we are in...
-Neverland.

41:45.625 --> 41:46.833
And this child...

41:47.666 --> 41:48.875
is no child.

41:50.625 --> 41:53.791
Nor I a gentle man.

41:54.750 --> 41:57.708
So, say your goodbyes, Wendy.

41:59.208 --> 42:03.500
For you shan't be seeing him
in this world again.

42:09.041 --> 42:10.041
No.

42:10.791 --> 42:11.833
- Oh, God.

42:19.791 --> 42:21.833
-That is one big crocodile.

42:27.166 --> 42:28.625
-- Look!

42:28.708 --> 42:30.000
Avast, great beast!

42:36.750 --> 42:37.750
No! No! No!

42:38.958 --> 42:39.958
Oh, my!

42:42.000 --> 42:44.916
Run! Run!

42:55.416 --> 42:56.958
- Tally ho!

42:58.791 --> 43:00.208
Come on. Let's go.

43:54.250 --> 43:55.333
Well, that was fun.

44:01.875 --> 44:04.625
It was an adventure.
Isn't that what you wanted?

44:04.708 --> 44:08.000
Yes, but I didn't think that meant
being shot out of the sky by pirates.

44:08.083 --> 44:09.083
Or drowned.

44:09.166 --> 44:10.916
Or dismembered.

44:14.541 --> 44:17.125
Tinker Bell, I don't understand you.
What are you saying?

44:17.208 --> 44:19.208
What she's saying is, I saved the day.

44:19.291 --> 44:21.041
You sort of saved the day.

44:21.125 --> 44:22.541
You saved part of the day.

44:22.625 --> 44:24.333
And I did a pretty good job at it.

44:25.666 --> 44:26.958
- And it's not like you had

44:27.041 --> 44:29.083
-any help at all.
-No, I didn't.

44:29.166 --> 44:30.166
I'm Peter Pan.

44:30.583 --> 44:32.291
I don't ever need help.

44:33.333 --> 44:35.541
You have a magical fairy
that makes you fly.

44:36.708 --> 44:39.958
A gaggle of children to do your bidding,
a princess who cleans up after you

44:40.041 --> 44:41.791
while you're off gallivanting
with pirates.

44:42.625 --> 44:45.916
Do you really think that
you could beat Captain Hook on your own?

44:46.000 --> 44:47.833
-What's a gaggle?
-Hmm.

44:47.916 --> 44:49.958
Of course, I could. I always beat him.

44:50.041 --> 44:52.250
That's just how it works. Always has.

44:52.333 --> 44:53.333
Always will.

44:53.916 --> 44:56.166
And what happens if it doesn't?

44:57.125 --> 44:58.416
Yes, what happens then?

44:59.666 --> 45:00.833
That won't ever happen.

45:00.916 --> 45:02.916
-Will it, Peter?
-- Of course not.

45:03.291 --> 45:04.666
This is Neverland.

45:04.750 --> 45:06.500
Where nothing ever changes.

45:07.375 --> 45:08.416
Least of all, me.

45:10.083 --> 45:11.083
Right.

45:20.208 --> 45:22.208
- It's not true
what Peter says, you know?

45:22.291 --> 45:23.416
Some things do change.

45:23.500 --> 45:25.625
-We're not to talk.

45:25.708 --> 45:27.916
What? What aren't you
supposed to talk about?

45:30.500 --> 45:32.250
Hook wasn't always Hook.

45:56.583 --> 45:58.083
Come along, don't dilly-dally.

46:03.750 --> 46:04.958
What is this place?

46:05.583 --> 46:06.583
It's home.

46:07.083 --> 46:08.083
Come on.

46:19.875 --> 46:20.958
Aren't you coming?

46:21.041 --> 46:22.041
No.

46:23.125 --> 46:24.791
It's their home, not mine.

46:27.083 --> 46:28.708
Not yours either, I don't think.

46:31.583 --> 46:33.875
I don't know where my home is exactly...

46:36.583 --> 46:37.833
Or where I want it to be.

46:38.750 --> 46:39.750
- You will.

46:43.083 --> 46:44.916
The first time I rode out on my own,

46:48.375 --> 46:49.958
my great great grandmother,

46:51.333 --> 46:53.333
she came to me and said,

46:54.125 --> 46:56.500
"Feel the ground beneath your feet,

46:57.875 --> 47:01.375
"so that your eyes can find the stars.

47:01.458 --> 47:03.291
"Hold the past in your heart,

47:04.541 --> 47:08.166
"but know that where you go from here,
it's up to you."

47:15.791 --> 47:16.791
Sleep tight,

47:17.666 --> 47:19.291
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

47:21.083 --> 47:22.375
Then get home safe.

47:44.916 --> 47:45.916
Hi, Wendy.

47:50.166 --> 47:51.875
Well, how did you find this place?

47:52.708 --> 47:55.541
Peter found it.
Just like he found all of us.

47:57.583 --> 47:58.958
- Just like he found me.

47:59.875 --> 48:01.125
Exactly.

48:29.208 --> 48:30.583
Wendy?

48:30.666 --> 48:32.333
Can you tell us a bedtime story, now?

48:32.791 --> 48:35.000
-Yes! Bedtime stories!

48:36.625 --> 48:38.250
- We've been waiting forever.

48:39.583 --> 48:40.916
- Well, I could,

48:42.416 --> 48:46.250
but I was thinking, perhaps,
Peter could tell us a story first.

48:46.708 --> 48:48.208
-What about?
-- I don't know.

48:49.708 --> 48:51.333
Maybe how you came to Neverland?

48:51.750 --> 48:52.958
Or how you met Captain Hook.

48:55.041 --> 48:57.416
It's a very short story
and it goes like this...

48:58.041 --> 49:00.750
I fought Captain Hook in a duel
and I cut off his hand.

49:00.833 --> 49:02.458
Yes. Yes. Everyone knows that.

49:03.416 --> 49:04.666
How'd you two meet?

49:05.500 --> 49:07.458
Why'd you start fighting
in the first place?

49:07.541 --> 49:08.958
Because he's a pirate.

49:10.500 --> 49:11.500
And I'm Peter Pan.

49:11.583 --> 49:13.833
But surely, it can't be as simple as that.

49:13.916 --> 49:14.916
Why not?

49:16.333 --> 49:17.583
Because nothing ever is.

49:19.458 --> 49:20.458
Where are you two from?

49:21.708 --> 49:23.333
Where's his mother and father?

49:23.958 --> 49:24.958
Where are yours?

49:25.041 --> 49:27.208
Uh, that's a trick question.

49:28.041 --> 49:31.208
This is Neverland
where there are no mothers and fathers.

49:31.291 --> 49:32.500
Why aren't there?

49:33.041 --> 49:34.500
I don't remember my mother.

49:34.583 --> 49:36.125
Well, now you don't have to.

49:36.750 --> 49:38.166
Wendy can be our mother.

49:38.833 --> 49:39.833
Goodness, no.

49:40.500 --> 49:42.708
I don't even know
if I want to be a mother.

49:43.791 --> 49:44.875
But I still have one.

49:45.708 --> 49:46.708
So do you,

49:47.416 --> 49:48.416
and you,

49:49.458 --> 49:50.458
and all of you.

49:52.208 --> 49:53.625
Somewhere out there...

49:56.416 --> 49:57.416
she misses you.

50:01.541 --> 50:03.291
She loves you very much.

50:04.083 --> 50:05.750
I wouldn't mind seeing my mother again.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Yes, you would.

50:08.416 --> 50:10.875
If you went back home,
it would be the end of all our fun.

50:10.958 --> 50:11.958
All our adventures.

50:12.625 --> 50:15.291
All you'd have left... is growing up.

50:19.250 --> 50:22.083
It's never good when Peter
starts slamming doors.

50:22.583 --> 50:24.500
I'm sorry I asked for a story, Wendy.

50:24.583 --> 50:26.083
- Oh, it's not your fault.

50:27.958 --> 50:29.375
How about...

50:33.875 --> 50:36.708
How about I sing you a lullaby instead?

50:37.125 --> 50:38.125
What's a lullaby?

50:38.916 --> 50:42.458
It's a song that my mother sings me
and my brothers sometimes.

50:43.625 --> 50:45.208
I believe it goes like this...

50:49.250 --> 50:54.958
It's time to fall asleep, my friends

50:55.791 --> 51:02.583
And dream of fun that never ends

51:03.208 --> 51:08.833
Like swift adventures up above

51:09.583 --> 51:14.666
And roaring fires and mother's love

51:15.125 --> 51:21.625
For when she turns in the moonlight

51:22.291 --> 51:28.625
She knows you're up above the night

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Do you hear that?

51:38.166 --> 51:39.291
What is that?

51:39.375 --> 51:40.875
Fruit bats.

51:40.958 --> 51:42.291
They come in this time of year.

51:42.375 --> 51:43.666
No. Listen...

51:46.666 --> 51:47.666
I believe,

51:51.916 --> 51:54.375
I've heard something like that before.

52:20.333 --> 52:23.750
Dear, Tinker Bell,
I wish I could understand you.

52:27.541 --> 52:29.375
I don't think that Peter can either.

52:29.458 --> 52:31.458
He actually doesn't listen, does he?

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
Well, it's his loss, not yours.

52:39.291 --> 52:41.625
I'm sure you've
simply wonderful things to say.

53:10.291 --> 53:11.416
"James."

53:12.083 --> 53:13.083
Who's James?

53:18.583 --> 53:19.583
Oh.

53:25.125 --> 53:26.125
Peter?

53:28.833 --> 53:31.041
Oh, Peter, come on.

53:31.791 --> 53:33.083
Don't be like that.

53:38.625 --> 53:41.166
-What's this?
-- It's a kiss.

53:41.875 --> 53:44.708
I made it for you, so we'd both have one.

53:45.791 --> 53:47.208
I thought we'd be friends.

53:48.041 --> 53:49.875
Instead, we're just...

53:49.958 --> 53:51.041
Fighting.

53:53.833 --> 53:55.250
Just like you and Hook.

53:59.875 --> 54:01.791
Hook was a friend of yours, wasn't he?

54:04.291 --> 54:05.500
He was my best friend.

54:08.375 --> 54:09.791
And the very first Lost Boy.

54:11.416 --> 54:12.500
And what happened?

54:14.458 --> 54:18.041
Neverland... just wasn't good enough
for him, I guess.

54:21.208 --> 54:24.041
He sailed away one morning without a word

54:25.375 --> 54:26.708
and left me all alone.

54:28.875 --> 54:31.250
When he returned, he'd changed.

54:32.916 --> 54:33.916
He was cruel.

54:34.875 --> 54:36.166
Evil.

54:36.250 --> 54:39.250
Was he though? Or had he just grown up?

54:39.333 --> 54:40.458
What's the difference?

54:44.916 --> 54:46.625
That's why you mustn't ever leave.

54:47.916 --> 54:50.083
Who knows what you'll become if you go.

54:50.166 --> 54:51.625
What will I become if I stay?

54:51.708 --> 54:54.791
Nothing. Just be you. Like me.

54:57.750 --> 54:59.666
I really thought you'd be happy here.

55:01.083 --> 55:02.208
Yes, I did too.

55:03.416 --> 55:06.583
But Neverland is not exactly
what I was expecting.

55:08.541 --> 55:11.208
Peter, it's so much more real.

55:11.291 --> 55:15.041
- Of course it's real.
It's just a different real.

55:15.708 --> 55:16.708
A better real.

55:18.583 --> 55:20.583
-Peter...
-Goodnight, Wendy.

55:44.458 --> 55:45.458
- Mr. Bear.

56:00.291 --> 56:04.083
- Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

56:08.041 --> 56:10.208
The little sing-song girl

56:11.541 --> 56:13.166
of London, England.

56:15.666 --> 56:19.500
Your voice drew me back to my old home.

56:22.291 --> 56:23.291
Thank you.

57:13.666 --> 57:14.750
Got you!

57:22.833 --> 57:24.208
Where are you?

57:29.958 --> 57:35.875
How many times did we play hide-and-seek
in these ruins?

57:39.666 --> 57:41.458
You were always the best at hiding.

57:45.750 --> 57:46.750
Then again...

57:47.500 --> 57:49.000
I was always the best...

57:51.250 --> 57:53.125
at finding you!

57:58.583 --> 57:59.583
Captain Hook?

58:01.125 --> 58:02.125
Yes.

58:04.375 --> 58:05.916
I don't think I like this adventure.

58:33.500 --> 58:34.500
Peter!

58:35.125 --> 58:36.125
Peter!

58:36.791 --> 58:38.000
No!

58:43.083 --> 58:44.625
What have you done?

58:48.291 --> 58:49.291
I've done it.

58:49.375 --> 58:50.375
- Peter!

58:51.875 --> 58:53.666
I've killed Peter Pan.

1:00:20.666 --> 1:00:21.666


1:00:37.916 --> 1:00:39.250
- I want a word...

1:00:40.166 --> 1:00:41.250
with...

1:00:41.916 --> 1:00:42.916
you!

1:00:49.333 --> 1:00:51.708
-I have nothing to say to you.
-Then listen.

1:01:17.166 --> 1:01:18.166
What is that?

1:01:19.250 --> 1:01:21.166
Yeah, it's simply...
That's just a lullaby.

1:01:21.250 --> 1:01:23.583
Yes, but why...

1:01:24.750 --> 1:01:27.250
does it remind me of something?

1:01:30.416 --> 1:01:32.250
-Open this!
-Yes.

1:01:33.250 --> 1:01:34.916
Where are the keys? Keys. Keys. Keys.

1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.666
Where does it come from? Tell me.

1:01:37.750 --> 1:01:39.375
-I don't know.
-Tell me!

1:01:41.125 --> 1:01:43.500
Why does it make me feel so...

1:01:44.375 --> 1:01:45.708
I couldn't say.

1:01:45.791 --> 1:01:47.875
It was just something my mother sings us.

1:01:47.958 --> 1:01:48.958
Your who?

1:01:50.125 --> 1:01:51.125
My mother.

1:01:59.625 --> 1:02:00.708
Yes, of course.

1:02:14.708 --> 1:02:17.416
I know you weren't always like this,
Captain Hook.

1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:21.791
I know you and Peter were friends.

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.500
I've heard stories.

1:02:25.583 --> 1:02:26.666
Have you?

1:02:27.458 --> 1:02:28.541
- You left Neverland.

1:02:29.875 --> 1:02:31.708
And when you returned, you were...

1:02:31.791 --> 1:02:32.833
Evil.

1:02:35.708 --> 1:02:36.708
Yes.

1:02:36.791 --> 1:02:37.833
- Hmm.

1:02:40.583 --> 1:02:42.000
There's truth to that.

1:02:47.500 --> 1:02:49.500
But he left out the most important part.

1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:54.083
I didn't just leave Neverland.

1:02:58.458 --> 1:02:59.666
Peter made you go.

1:03:00.416 --> 1:03:01.416
There it is.

1:03:03.166 --> 1:03:04.625
There's the sticking point.

1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.791
My once and best friend banished me,

1:03:09.875 --> 1:03:11.458
all because I missed my...

1:03:19.958 --> 1:03:21.958
I... missed...

1:03:27.375 --> 1:03:28.375
my...

1:03:43.291 --> 1:03:44.291
Your mother?

1:03:44.375 --> 1:03:46.375
Yes, my mother.

1:03:50.041 --> 1:03:51.875
Who sang me that very song.

1:03:54.458 --> 1:03:55.875
Is it so terrible a thing,

1:03:57.500 --> 1:03:58.500
to miss a mother?

1:03:58.583 --> 1:04:00.916
No, of course, it's not.

1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.375
Tell that to your dearly departed friend,

1:04:04.416 --> 1:04:06.083
for he surely thought otherwise.

1:04:09.083 --> 1:04:11.750
And do you know, after all that,
I never did find her.

1:04:12.458 --> 1:04:13.875
I never made it home.

1:04:13.958 --> 1:04:17.791
I never saw my poor,
sweet mama, ever again.

1:04:20.416 --> 1:04:23.833
I left Neverland and I was lost at sea.

1:04:27.333 --> 1:04:28.625
I'd have surely perished,

1:04:30.541 --> 1:04:32.541
were I not saved by this man here.

1:04:34.250 --> 1:04:38.791
There I was, rescued
and raised by pirates.

1:04:40.416 --> 1:04:42.333
And by-and-by, I became their Captain

1:04:42.416 --> 1:04:47.208
and I, in-turn brought them
right back here.

1:04:47.833 --> 1:04:48.833
But why?

1:04:50.375 --> 1:04:52.875
Why come back at all,
if Peter hurt you so?

1:04:52.958 --> 1:04:54.375
Because he was my friend.

1:04:56.666 --> 1:04:57.708
I'd been happy here.

1:04:57.791 --> 1:05:00.000
-You could be happy again.
-No.

1:05:00.083 --> 1:05:02.333
My time for joy is lost.

1:05:02.875 --> 1:05:07.875
Everything I could have been
has been reduced to this.

1:05:10.125 --> 1:05:11.125
This...

1:05:17.458 --> 1:05:19.000
is what growing up looks like.

1:05:20.041 --> 1:05:21.041
No.

1:05:21.833 --> 1:05:24.416
This is what it looks like,
when you grow up wrong.

1:05:29.125 --> 1:05:31.833
You find me a child
who truly knows the difference

1:05:31.916 --> 1:05:33.625
between right and wrong.

1:05:35.458 --> 1:05:37.708
And I'll show you a man

1:05:39.666 --> 1:05:42.500
who can't remember
why it mattered in the first place.

1:05:46.583 --> 1:05:49.000
Execute every last one of them.

1:05:56.416 --> 1:05:58.166
-- No! Wait! Stop!
-Come here!

1:05:58.791 --> 1:05:59.833
Guilty!

1:05:59.916 --> 1:06:02.916
-James, don't you think that...
-Never call me that!

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:09.000
I am Captain Hook.

1:06:09.875 --> 1:06:11.958
Please stop! Take me.

1:06:13.750 --> 1:06:15.500
Take me instead!

1:06:16.791 --> 1:06:18.791
They're only children, let them live.

1:06:21.041 --> 1:06:23.250
When they grow up,
they'll be good pirates,

1:06:23.958 --> 1:06:25.166
especially those two.

1:06:25.791 --> 1:06:27.041
Please take me.

1:06:29.833 --> 1:06:32.458
Your largesse is admirable.

1:06:34.916 --> 1:06:36.916
Perhaps it'll lead to a bigger splash.

1:06:39.541 --> 1:06:40.791
No! Wendy! No!

1:06:42.291 --> 1:06:44.291
Wendy! No! Wendy!

1:06:45.291 --> 1:06:46.500
John, I'm sorry.

1:06:48.125 --> 1:06:49.250
- No, Wendy!

1:07:16.666 --> 1:07:17.666
Puhkitinin kguh weechitdaan.

1:07:17.750 --> 1:07:19.291
Where is everyone? Where's Tink?

1:07:20.041 --> 1:07:21.208
Where are my Lost Boys?

1:07:23.333 --> 1:07:24.500
They were taken.

1:07:25.541 --> 1:07:26.583
- By Hook?

1:07:51.791 --> 1:07:52.916
Let me help you.

1:08:20.791 --> 1:08:24.625
A route unravels where those who travel

1:08:24.708 --> 1:08:29.708
Don't return from the Earth

1:08:29.791 --> 1:08:34.625
So take a hop tiny, and bob on the briny

1:08:34.708 --> 1:08:39.916
Seek the shore, forever more

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.416
Fair winds

1:08:43.500 --> 1:08:48.791
And following seas

1:08:49.458 --> 1:08:54.541
Elude alligator, confront the creator

1:08:54.625 --> 1:09:00.291
Thine eyes shall see, the mystery

1:09:00.375 --> 1:09:04.250
Fair winds

1:09:04.333 --> 1:09:10.333
And following seas

1:09:10.916 --> 1:09:15.125
And as you sink deeper
and stare at the reaper

1:09:15.208 --> 1:09:19.875
Who waits on the tongues of leviathans

1:09:19.958 --> 1:09:24.500
And there's a lot of 'em,
you won't touch the bottom

1:09:24.583 --> 1:09:29.708
And as we suggested,
you're slowly digested

1:09:29.791 --> 1:09:33.291
Fish food

1:09:33.375 --> 1:09:38.375
And following sea

1:09:43.041 --> 1:09:44.041
- Farewell then.

1:09:46.291 --> 1:09:50.208
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

1:09:51.375 --> 1:09:56.333
Into the water, no son or daughters

1:09:56.416 --> 1:10:01.833
Escapes the drink, they'll certainly sink

1:10:02.125 --> 1:10:06.083
Fair winds

1:10:06.166 --> 1:10:12.583
And following seas

1:10:12.666 --> 1:10:14.250
Fair winds

1:10:14.333 --> 1:10:16.208
Think happy thoughts.

1:11:05.416 --> 1:11:06.416
Mr. Smee.

1:11:08.458 --> 1:11:09.666
Mr. Smee.

1:11:11.458 --> 1:11:13.666
Yes, yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1:11:15.125 --> 1:11:18.041
-Did you hear a splash?
-Absolutely, Captain.

1:11:18.125 --> 1:11:19.125
It was, uh...

1:11:21.541 --> 1:11:23.875
-Actually...
-I didn't hear one.

1:11:24.333 --> 1:11:25.458
Nor I.

1:11:25.541 --> 1:11:27.375
But I'm sure one's coming.

1:11:33.125 --> 1:11:35.250
Well, she surely must have
hit the water by now.

1:11:35.333 --> 1:11:38.416
Unless she fell very slowly.

1:11:41.541 --> 1:11:44.916
Did anyone hear a splash?

1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.416
-- Was there a splash?
-Mmm-mmm.

1:12:23.083 --> 1:12:24.708
Why that looks like...

1:12:35.208 --> 1:12:36.916
-Wendy!
-- Wendy!

1:12:37.916 --> 1:12:39.250
You have the boy's magic.

1:12:40.166 --> 1:12:42.875
No. This magic belongs to no boy.

1:12:46.166 --> 1:12:47.958
We still have you outnumbered, girl.

1:12:48.416 --> 1:12:50.166
Hand over hook over fist.

1:12:51.458 --> 1:12:55.708
My men would lay down their lives
for their captain.

1:12:56.541 --> 1:12:57.541
Yes.

1:12:58.291 --> 1:13:01.208
But what's a captain without his ship?

1:13:26.041 --> 1:13:27.958
Smee!

1:13:29.916 --> 1:13:31.375
-Mr. Smee.
-Yes, Cap.

1:13:32.333 --> 1:13:34.208
Get my ship back in the water.

1:13:36.750 --> 1:13:39.458
-Hands on the wheel!
-Hand on the wheel!

1:13:39.541 --> 1:13:41.708
Drop the anchor! Make it fast!

1:13:51.208 --> 1:13:52.208
Is that?

1:13:52.291 --> 1:13:54.166
-I think it might be.
-It couldn't be!

1:13:56.250 --> 1:13:57.250
But it definitely is.

1:14:08.041 --> 1:14:09.250
-Peter!

1:14:09.333 --> 1:14:10.708
-Peter!
-Pan!

1:14:28.666 --> 1:14:29.666
Miss me?

1:14:31.125 --> 1:14:32.666
More than you'll ever know.

1:14:35.375 --> 1:14:37.916
Well, wake me up
if one of them kills the other.

1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:39.000
Again.

1:14:43.708 --> 1:14:45.208
How did you do it, boy?

1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.541
How did you survive?

1:14:50.791 --> 1:14:52.791
Faith, trust and pixie dust?

1:14:52.875 --> 1:14:53.875
No.

1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:55.833
No pixie dust this time.

1:14:55.916 --> 1:14:56.916
No magic.

1:14:57.833 --> 1:14:58.833
No tricks.

1:15:00.166 --> 1:15:01.875
Just a little help from my friends.

1:15:03.083 --> 1:15:05.083
You dare to speak to me of friends

1:15:06.208 --> 1:15:08.833
when all of yours now belong to me?

1:15:13.708 --> 1:15:14.958
Proud...

1:15:16.458 --> 1:15:18.083
and insolent youth,

1:15:21.166 --> 1:15:22.416
raise your sword.

1:15:24.250 --> 1:15:25.500
Sad and sinister man,

1:15:28.916 --> 1:15:29.916
one last time.

1:15:48.916 --> 1:15:50.625
- Oh!

1:16:06.250 --> 1:16:07.458
Get off!

1:16:09.416 --> 1:16:10.541
Get the children!

1:16:11.541 --> 1:16:12.916
Get the pirates!

1:16:18.250 --> 1:16:19.666
-I've got the bear!
-- Hey!

1:16:19.750 --> 1:16:21.000
The bear is mine!

1:16:21.833 --> 1:16:24.041
- Give me back my bear!

1:16:33.333 --> 1:16:35.166
Give it back!

1:16:35.250 --> 1:16:37.125
Don't touch my brother!

1:16:37.500 --> 1:16:38.916
Or his bear!

1:17:04.833 --> 1:17:05.833
Uhh!

1:17:33.708 --> 1:17:34.958
Just like old times.

1:17:35.791 --> 1:17:38.583
-All your times are old, Captain.

1:17:58.583 --> 1:17:59.583
- Upon him!

1:18:08.708 --> 1:18:10.166
-Michael, come on.

1:18:41.125 --> 1:18:43.250
-Uhh!
-Almost there.

1:18:48.750 --> 1:18:49.958
Oh. That was close.

1:18:50.041 --> 1:18:52.458
Kids, give me that wheel.

1:18:54.916 --> 1:18:55.916
- Wendy!

1:18:57.208 --> 1:18:58.208
Help!

1:18:59.958 --> 1:19:00.958
- The helm!

1:19:14.500 --> 1:19:15.708


1:19:20.666 --> 1:19:23.041
Right, John, Michael,
hang on to something.

1:19:23.125 --> 1:19:24.791
Everyone, hang on!

1:19:30.166 --> 1:19:31.333
Three!

1:19:32.291 --> 1:19:33.333
Two!

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:37.000
One.

1:20:24.125 --> 1:20:27.875
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

1:20:40.291 --> 1:20:41.875
- Hang on, Peter!

1:20:41.958 --> 1:20:43.041
Don't look down.

1:20:43.125 --> 1:20:44.458
- Peter, no! No, hang on!

1:20:45.041 --> 1:20:46.041
Don't let go.

1:20:46.541 --> 1:20:47.625
-Peter!

1:21:12.041 --> 1:21:15.208
Do you know, what really hurts

1:21:16.625 --> 1:21:18.166
about getting old?

1:21:18.916 --> 1:21:22.333
It's not the creaking bones

1:21:24.416 --> 1:21:25.791
or the dashed dreams

1:21:26.666 --> 1:21:30.291
or even the sense of death

1:21:31.625 --> 1:21:32.833
drawing ever the nearer.

1:21:34.166 --> 1:21:37.416
It's knowing your best friend
can stare you in the eyes

1:21:37.500 --> 1:21:39.083
and not recognize you.

1:21:39.166 --> 1:21:41.375
-You're the one who wanted to leave.
-I was a child!

1:21:44.375 --> 1:21:45.458
- Wait, stop!

1:22:05.541 --> 1:22:06.625
Go ahead, boy.

1:22:07.541 --> 1:22:08.541
Go ahead.

1:22:10.041 --> 1:22:13.541
But imagine a Neverland
without the two of us.

1:22:15.333 --> 1:22:16.666
Without our battles.

1:22:17.583 --> 1:22:18.791
Our brawls.

1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:22.000
I know

1:22:23.666 --> 1:22:24.916
without you

1:22:26.500 --> 1:22:30.291
the fire that fuels me will go out.

1:22:31.291 --> 1:22:32.291
Without me,

1:22:33.291 --> 1:22:35.291
you'd have no choice but to...

1:22:35.375 --> 1:22:37.375
-Be a real boy?
-No.

1:22:38.958 --> 1:22:41.250
No. A real boy would have to grow.

1:22:41.333 --> 1:22:42.625
A real boy...

1:22:42.708 --> 1:22:43.833
Would apologize.

1:22:43.916 --> 1:22:45.791
Apologize?

1:22:48.583 --> 1:22:49.583
For what?

1:22:50.333 --> 1:22:51.333
For hurting you.

1:22:53.583 --> 1:22:54.791
For being a rotten friend.

1:23:03.583 --> 1:23:05.666
I'm sorry I did what I did, Captain Hook.

1:23:07.583 --> 1:23:09.208
I'm sorry I hurt you, James.

1:23:11.833 --> 1:23:13.125
You don't get to do that.

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:17.500
No, that's not how this works.

1:23:19.041 --> 1:23:20.458
I want you to fight.

1:23:21.375 --> 1:23:23.750
-I need you to fight.
-This isn't fun anymore.

1:23:23.833 --> 1:23:26.416
It's not supposed to be fun!

1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:28.125
Oh, Captain.

1:23:30.083 --> 1:23:31.250
Grow up.

1:23:38.458 --> 1:23:39.583
- Got you.

1:23:39.875 --> 1:23:40.875
Don't worry, James.

1:23:40.958 --> 1:23:42.000
Oh.

1:23:42.083 --> 1:23:43.375
Just think happy thoughts.

1:23:52.791 --> 1:23:53.791
Peter.

1:23:57.125 --> 1:23:58.541
I haven't got any.

1:24:40.833 --> 1:24:42.250
- What's wrong, Peter?

1:24:44.750 --> 1:24:45.791
He was my friend.

1:24:47.333 --> 1:24:49.125
We're your friends, too, Peter.

1:24:49.208 --> 1:24:50.875
We're always on your side, Peter.

1:24:51.666 --> 1:24:52.958
- I know.

1:24:54.416 --> 1:24:56.416
And I'm glad you are, but...

1:25:00.291 --> 1:25:01.291
- Peter,

1:25:04.541 --> 1:25:07.208
don't you think it's time
we get these Lost Boys home?

1:25:16.083 --> 1:25:17.625
Where to, Peter?

1:25:17.708 --> 1:25:20.375
Second star to the right,
straight on till morning.

1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000
Wait, wouldn't it be left?

1:25:23.750 --> 1:25:25.375
-What?
-- The star.

1:25:25.458 --> 1:25:28.583
-If we're going in the opposite direction.
-- Oh, yes! That's right.

1:25:28.666 --> 1:25:31.791
- Yes. Yes, it's right.
Wait, we're going left, right?

1:25:34.458 --> 1:25:37.041
- No, no, no. People!
It has always been right, Twins?

1:25:48.750 --> 1:25:49.750


1:26:27.541 --> 1:26:28.541
- Goodness, Wendy.

1:26:29.166 --> 1:26:30.625
You gave me a fright.

1:26:31.625 --> 1:26:33.333
Mother? I...

1:26:35.375 --> 1:26:36.375
What is it?

1:26:36.458 --> 1:26:37.875
I'm sorry.

1:26:39.666 --> 1:26:43.250
Oh, there, there. Oh, sweet girl.

1:26:43.333 --> 1:26:45.416
It's quite all right.

1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:47.208
And I think I'm ready.

1:26:47.291 --> 1:26:48.500
Ready for what?

1:26:49.083 --> 1:26:50.375
-I'm ready to grow...

1:26:52.750 --> 1:26:54.083
Did you hear something?

1:26:54.166 --> 1:26:55.541
No, I didn't hear anything.

1:26:55.625 --> 1:26:57.875
- What on Earth?
- I think it was just a...

1:26:58.416 --> 1:27:00.041
-What's that commotion?
-- Nothing.

1:27:00.125 --> 1:27:02.500
-Father, I heard something, too.
-Intruders.

1:27:02.583 --> 1:27:04.083
- There are no intruders.

1:27:04.166 --> 1:27:07.000
No, Father, Mother,
I have something to explain to you.

1:27:07.083 --> 1:27:08.916
- Stay out here.
- No, don't go in.

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.000
- Oh, no, be careful with that! No!

1:27:11.083 --> 1:27:13.375
That was a present
from my Uncle John and Auntie Ang.

1:27:13.458 --> 1:27:15.458
Please, please, please, careful. Just...

1:27:21.500 --> 1:27:23.500
Who are all these children?

1:27:25.625 --> 1:27:27.208
Mother.

1:27:33.625 --> 1:27:35.208
Uh-uh...

1:27:35.291 --> 1:27:36.958
Where on Earth did you come from?

1:27:37.041 --> 1:27:39.291
They came from Neverland, Father.

1:27:39.875 --> 1:27:40.875
Never-where?

1:27:52.541 --> 1:27:53.541
Boy,

1:27:55.083 --> 1:27:56.375
why are you crying?

1:27:57.958 --> 1:28:00.125
You know how you asked me
where I came from?

1:28:01.916 --> 1:28:02.916
Yes.

1:28:15.416 --> 1:28:17.833
-This was your home?
-- It was, once.

1:28:19.041 --> 1:28:20.625
My mother scolded me one night

1:28:21.916 --> 1:28:23.208
and told me to grow up.

1:28:24.708 --> 1:28:27.333
Instead, I climbed out of the window,

1:28:27.416 --> 1:28:28.833
leapt over the garden wall,

1:28:30.458 --> 1:28:31.583
and never looked back.

1:28:32.791 --> 1:28:34.041
Except you did.

1:28:36.708 --> 1:28:39.625
That's why you kept coming back, isn't it?

1:28:40.500 --> 1:28:44.875
Because you miss your home.
And you miss...

1:28:47.125 --> 1:28:48.208
My mother.

1:28:50.541 --> 1:28:51.791
But she's long gone now.

1:28:53.333 --> 1:28:54.333
I'm just a story.

1:28:55.291 --> 1:28:57.625
A story told to any child who'd listen.

1:28:59.333 --> 1:29:01.500
It never had an ending, until now.

1:29:03.791 --> 1:29:06.583
Maybe I could still come back
to listen to it sometimes.

1:29:09.666 --> 1:29:10.916
Or you could stay.

1:29:11.750 --> 1:29:12.750
Here?

1:29:12.833 --> 1:29:13.833
Yes.

1:29:15.333 --> 1:29:17.708
But you're going to leave.
Going to grow up.

1:29:19.041 --> 1:29:20.083
You know, Peter.

1:29:22.666 --> 1:29:26.208
After all this, I think that to grow up...

1:29:27.791 --> 1:29:31.250
Why, it might just be
the biggest adventure of all.

1:29:33.291 --> 1:29:36.291
Just think of all the things
that could be right around the corner

1:29:36.375 --> 1:29:37.916
that you're missing out on.

1:29:39.291 --> 1:29:44.125
Think of what the world is missing out on
with you not being there to do them.

1:29:50.125 --> 1:29:51.333
I don't think I'm ready.

1:30:05.125 --> 1:30:06.208
No, wait! Peter!

1:30:09.708 --> 1:30:10.916
Don't go.

1:30:17.125 --> 1:30:18.500
What sort of magic is this?

1:30:22.375 --> 1:30:23.583
Who's that boy?

1:30:24.958 --> 1:30:26.791
Why, that's Peter Pan.

1:30:29.500 --> 1:30:30.500
Goodbye, Tink.

1:30:32.250 --> 1:30:34.333
You take care of Peter

1:30:35.583 --> 1:30:37.250
and please don't forget about me.

1:30:39.125 --> 1:30:40.208
I could never.

1:30:43.125 --> 1:30:47.625
Wendy, thank you for hearing me.

1:31:14.916 --> 1:31:15.916
Goodbye, Peter Pan.

1:31:16.750 --> 1:31:18.500
Goodbye, Peter Pan!

1:32:30.416 --> 1:32:33.041
Did you see me, Cap?

1:32:33.750 --> 1:32:35.041
I'm still alive!

1:32:35.125 --> 1:32:36.916
-I didn't drown!
-Do you hear that?

1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:38.000
I'm floating!

1:32:38.166 --> 1:32:40.000
-Look at us, we're floating.
-Did you hear that?

1:32:42.416 --> 1:32:43.416
The gulls?

1:32:43.500 --> 1:32:44.500
No!

1:32:45.250 --> 1:32:46.250
Crocodile?

1:32:46.583 --> 1:32:47.583
No!

1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:50.000
What then?

1:36:13.416 --> 1:36:19.625
It's time to drift away, my loves

1:36:20.916 --> 1:36:27.875
And dream of cooing turtle doves

1:36:28.166 --> 1:36:34.583
For when I turn to switch the light

1:36:34.666 --> 1:36:41.208
I know you'll grow up overnight

1:36:43.041 --> 1:36:49.541
Fly off into the cloudless skies

1:36:49.625 --> 1:36:56.000
Where twinkling stars will fill your eyes

1:36:57.250 --> 1:37:01.291
I'll miss you dearly

1:37:01.625 --> 1:37:04.708
My brave little ones

1:37:06.166 --> 1:37:13.083
All grown up now in the morning sun

1:42:29.583 --> 1:42:31.625
Heave ho

1:42:31.708 --> 1:42:33.041
Heave ho

1:42:33.166 --> 1:42:36.291
Oh oh dark and quiet
are the devils in the deep

1:42:36.375 --> 1:42:38.666
So slow and silent
So you're swallowed in your sleep

1:42:38.875 --> 1:42:41.125
With a tail and a tooth
And I'm telling you the truth

1:42:41.208 --> 1:42:43.666
You'll be boiling in the belly
Of a behemoth

1:42:43.916 --> 1:42:48.083
Set sail with your sights abroad
And suddenly the suction of a cephalopod

1:42:48.208 --> 1:42:53.250
Has you thinking twice take my advice
A mutineer should also fear a firing squad
