21:26.827 --> 21:28.370
ELEMENTARY,

WOULD KNOCK THE
RAT'S SPATS

21:31.707 --> 21:34.209

21:34.292 --> 21:37.713

22:04.948 --> 22:07.075
Crocker: AHEM! WELL, CLASS,

22:07.159 --> 22:09.745

THEY'RE ALL HORRIBLE!

22:11.705 --> 22:16.585
A.J., EVERYBODY KNOWS
THE BOOK IS CALLED <i> MOBY DUCK!</i>

22:16.668 --> 22:22.007

22:42.861 --> 22:45.405
{\an4}AND ALL HE HAD TO DO
WAS GET EVERYBODY ELSE
TO FAIL TO DO IT.

22:45.489 --> 22:48.492
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK
I FORGOT SOMETHING,

22:48.575 --> 22:50.243
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.454
