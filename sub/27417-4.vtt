WEBVTT

00:00.933 --> 00:02.767
- Lay off my friend!
Do you understand me?

00:04.433 --> 00:07.400
- First you kill my plants,
then you lose my drugs.

00:07.433 --> 00:08.800
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:10.333 --> 00:12.100
- I'm gonna have
to call the police.

00:12.133 --> 00:13.833
- If you call the
police, Gem gets killed.

00:13.867 --> 00:15.500
- They have a witness.

00:15.533 --> 00:19.400
- The witness saw Kamale
enter Kayla's flat and you enter

00:19.433 --> 00:21.400
shortly afterwards
with two others.

00:21.433 --> 00:26.167
- If you get frightened,
you call that number, yeah?

00:26.200 --> 00:27.500
- Someone nicked my food.

00:28.533 --> 00:29.400
- I know who took it.

00:29.433 --> 00:32.233
- I reckon they're
keeping it in there.

00:32.267 --> 00:33.300
- Yeah.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.267
That means grabbing one of
'em and making 'em talk.

00:35.300 --> 00:38.167
- I'm gonna make
them talk, trust me.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.400
- Yeah, I trust you, fam.

00:39.433 --> 00:42.467
If this goes to plan, yeah,
we're gonna split this shipment

00:42.500 --> 00:44.167
50/50,

00:44.200 --> 00:46.033
run Summerhouse like we used to.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.067
We made a good team.

01:41.667 --> 01:43.667
- What the fuck
happened to the guarantee?

01:47.100 --> 01:50.267
You said there weren't
gonna be no comebacks on Mike.

01:50.300 --> 01:52.500
Then I turn around and he
gets shot right in front of my

01:52.533 --> 01:54.500
fucking face.

01:54.533 --> 01:55.667
Do you know what?
I'm going after Rafe.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.200
You're coming with me.

01:57.233 --> 01:58.567
- Bruv, I ain't going nowhere.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.133
- I told you about Mike already.

02:01.167 --> 02:02.733
Come on, man, that guy's
probably spent most of his life

02:02.767 --> 02:04.067
in prison.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.667
What does that
tell you about him?

02:05.700 --> 02:08.833
What, that he's gonna make
paper on the roads or something?

02:08.867 --> 02:11.133
- What, you set this
whole shit up,

02:11.167 --> 02:13.167
plotted it all out so Mike
gets killed?

02:13.200 --> 02:16.233
- When I went to see Rafe, my
main concern was to make sure

02:16.267 --> 02:17.767
that you were safe, fam, yeah?

02:17.800 --> 02:19.667
That there was no
comebacks on you.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.133
Mike's gone.

02:21.167 --> 02:22.467
That was the price.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.333
- You know I could
have dealt with Rafe.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.733
I ain't gonna lie to you,
bruv, I need you on my team.

02:28.767 --> 02:31.367
We ain't talking about a
couple of bags here, fam.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.233
We're talking about ten keys.

02:34.267 --> 02:36.267
We need to find a way
into that warehouse.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.633
This is the one, bruv.

02:57.367 --> 02:59.200
- I ain't going to school.

02:59.233 --> 03:01.733
- Well, you can't just
stay in the house all day.

03:01.767 --> 03:03.433
Ra'Nell, we talked about this.

03:03.467 --> 03:04.367
This is about your education--

03:04.400 --> 03:06.467
- Shit, I told you I
ain't going nowhere.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.733
Vincent's out there.

03:08.767 --> 03:12.467
- Don't talk to
me like that ever!

03:12.500 --> 03:13.533
- You don't know
about the roads.

03:13.567 --> 03:15.067
You ain't got a clue.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.300
I said I ain't going out there.

03:16.333 --> 03:17.700
- I will sort this out.

03:17.733 --> 03:20.533
- You're just a woman.
How are you gonna do that?

03:20.567 --> 03:22.733
If my dad was here,
he'd sort it out.

03:29.833 --> 03:32.000
Kayla's not our
only problem, cuz.

03:35.067 --> 03:39.467
This Vicky, the DC in charge of
the case, she claims she's got

03:39.500 --> 03:41.567
another witness.
What?

03:41.600 --> 03:44.267
- Yeah, well, she's
claims that she has.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.233
It don't mean she does.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.833
- We need to make Kayla
understand she needs to keep her

03:47.867 --> 03:50.333
mouth shut.

03:50.367 --> 03:51.467
- Yeah.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.000
Yeah, for real.

04:05.433 --> 04:06.833
- Morning, Kayla.

04:06.867 --> 04:08.300
Do you want a cuppa?

04:17.167 --> 04:18.500
- It's too open out here.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.033
- Well, you said not
to come in your office.

04:22.067 --> 04:24.567
- Yeah, I don't want you
anywhere near my office.

04:26.467 --> 04:30.800
- Look, I need you to
go and see Kayla for me.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.533
Tell her I know she's been a
good girl and that she ain't

04:32.567 --> 04:35.767
said nothing, and that's
what she should keep doing,

04:35.800 --> 04:36.800
say nothing.

04:36.833 --> 04:39.533
- I'm not passing any
message from you to her.

04:39.567 --> 04:40.467
That's completely illegal.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.733
I could go to prison,
do you understand?

04:41.767 --> 04:45.300
- If she keeps her mouth shut,
all this goes away for everyone

04:45.333 --> 04:47.700
and we can go back to doing what
we were gonna do, showing all

04:47.733 --> 04:49.800
those people that said we can't
have nothing that they were

04:49.833 --> 04:52.033
wrong.

04:52.067 --> 04:54.433
Ask yourself
this, is it that bad?

04:54.467 --> 04:56.733
Telling a girl to keep quiet?

04:56.767 --> 04:58.600
What's so hard about that?

05:00.433 --> 05:01.433
Oi.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.033
It's gonna be OK, yeah?

05:17.600 --> 05:18.800
- Hey.

05:18.833 --> 05:20.367
Why you no come see me?

05:20.400 --> 05:21.400
Huh?

05:27.267 --> 05:28.600
- That's Â£1.20.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.033
- I'm sorry!

05:32.067 --> 05:32.733
I was scared!

05:32.767 --> 05:35.533
Scared?

05:35.567 --> 05:36.400
Look at my eye.

05:36.567 --> 05:37.567
Look at my eye.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.800
You see fear?

05:39.833 --> 05:42.133
No fear ever.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.667
A man hit you, you stab him.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.300
That man never hit you again.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.600
Your father not teach you that?

05:47.633 --> 05:48.467
- No.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.700
- Father's job teach
son to become man.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.533
You keep safe, very safe.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.300
- It's not important.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.700
And don't come near the shop.

06:02.733 --> 06:04.733
You wait till I call you, OK?

06:04.767 --> 06:05.600
OK?

06:19.333 --> 06:20.800
- You know it's Michael, bruv.

06:20.833 --> 06:22.533
It has to be.

06:22.567 --> 06:24.167
He's the one that called you
that night and told you that

06:24.200 --> 06:26.367
Kamale was in
that house down LF.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.233
He saw us drive up.

06:27.267 --> 06:28.333
He saw us go in.

06:28.367 --> 06:29.467
It's gotta be him.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.567
He's the witness.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.300
Yeah, I
heard you, fam.

06:33.333 --> 06:36.200
We've gotta
deal with him.

06:36.233 --> 06:38.267
The longer we have him running
round out here, the more chance

06:38.300 --> 06:41.100
of him getting in the
box and giving evidence.

06:41.133 --> 06:42.800
We can't let that happen.

06:45.400 --> 06:48.300
- Just tell Collins to
keep an eye on him, yeah?

06:51.833 --> 06:53.733
* But who am I, a damn brother?

06:53.767 --> 06:55.767
* Problems of my damn own

06:55.800 --> 06:58.100
* I could see your point of view

06:58.133 --> 06:59.833
* Sometimes is best alone but

06:59.867 --> 07:02.600
* Out here, out there
and out here

07:02.633 --> 07:04.033
* It ain't safe

07:04.067 --> 07:05.833
* Maybe I'm just going on

07:05.867 --> 07:07.800
* Maybe I'm a nutcase

07:07.833 --> 07:09.767
* Now, I ain't thinking straight

07:09.800 --> 07:11.667
* Old-fashioned ways you see

07:11.700 --> 07:13.800
* Sometimes you can't help

07:13.833 --> 07:15.633
* Best left to just believe

07:15.667 --> 07:17.333
* Hey,

07:17.367 --> 07:18.767
* run away

07:18.800 --> 07:20.667
* Be a real mind

07:20.700 --> 07:22.633
* And fight another day

07:22.667 --> 07:26.733
* I heard that in a TV program

07:26.767 --> 07:29.100
* So it must be right, right

07:29.133 --> 07:31.633
* Right, right?

07:57.500 --> 07:58.800
- A friend of mine
recommended this place,

07:58.833 --> 08:01.133
said he had a good time here.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.000
Here.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.433
How'd you like to
earn some real money?

09:04.233 --> 09:06.400
Where's the money?
- I ain't got nothing.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.333
- Fuck!

09:10.600 --> 09:12.433
You fucking little liar.

09:14.500 --> 09:15.467
Fucking liar.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.667
Come here, you fuck!

09:16.700 --> 09:17.433
Come here!

09:17.467 --> 09:18.800
Fuck, come here!

09:18.833 --> 09:20.333
Get off of him!

09:20.367 --> 09:21.667
Fucking get off of him!

09:21.700 --> 09:23.667
I'll smash your
fucking teeth!

09:23.700 --> 09:25.600
Move or I'll fucking kill you!

09:25.633 --> 09:26.800
I'll fucking kill you!

09:26.833 --> 09:29.067
Get off, you fucking cunt!

09:29.100 --> 09:30.267
Get off!

09:32.867 --> 09:37.333
- You are one of a number of
known associates of Kamale Lewis

09:37.367 --> 09:40.333
who was interviewed shortly
after his disappearance on 10th

09:40.367 --> 09:41.667
March last year.

09:41.700 --> 09:46.700
Do you remember being
interviewed on 22nd March?

09:49.533 --> 09:56.433
You were asked, 'When was the
last time you saw Kamale?'

09:56.467 --> 10:02.300
And you answered, 'I haven't
seen him in about six months.'

10:02.333 --> 10:03.733
You see that?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.300
You see your signature?

10:07.333 --> 10:09.833
Is that your signature?

10:09.867 --> 10:12.533
Now, you can sit
there and keep on lying if

10:12.567 --> 10:15.467
that's what you wanna do, or you
can start telling the truth

10:15.500 --> 10:19.067
about what happened that night
and I will pass on to the CPS

10:19.100 --> 10:22.767
that you've cooperated and
they'll take that into account.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.500
Right.

10:28.767 --> 10:31.133
Kayla Thomas, I
am charging you...

10:32.167 --> 10:34.467
- I am charging you with
perverting the course of

10:34.500 --> 10:36.167
justice.
- I ain't done nothing.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.800
You know I ain't done
nothing, you fucking bitch.

10:37.833 --> 10:41.100
- In view of Miss Thomas's
previous convictions, we will be

10:41.133 --> 10:43.133
opposing bail.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.300
- I'd like an opportunity to
speak to my client in private.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.333
Of course.

10:52.733 --> 10:56.100
- This is totally wrong.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.700
I ain't done nothing.

10:57.733 --> 10:58.900
I'm the victim.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.467
When Dushane and Sully came
in that night, I thought I was

11:02.500 --> 11:04.333
gonna get killed an' all.

11:05.367 --> 11:08.033
They're gonna take
Elijah away from me.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.567
I can't lose my boy.

11:15.233 --> 11:18.233
What if I give 'em names
of the ones that done it?

11:20.633 --> 11:22.333
And they'd protect me, yeah?

11:22.367 --> 11:24.600
Protect me and Elijah?

11:24.633 --> 11:27.433
- If you cooperate, the
police would, of course, have to

11:27.467 --> 11:28.633
protect you.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.333
They're pure evil.

11:46.667 --> 11:47.833
- Yo.

11:47.867 --> 11:49.033
What?

11:49.767 --> 11:50.767
What?

11:51.300 --> 11:52.800
Oi, oi. Listen.

11:52.833 --> 11:54.667
Oi, wait there, I'm coming.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.067
Fucker!

12:01.533 --> 12:02.567
What?

12:02.600 --> 12:03.600
What the fuck do you-

12:06.833 --> 12:08.000
Fuck.

12:09.433 --> 12:10.433
Aargh!

12:16.433 --> 12:17.067
- I'm not gonna tell you again!

12:17.100 --> 12:19.600
Look after your fucking boy!

12:23.167 --> 12:24.500
You all right, Jase?

12:34.667 --> 12:36.100
- They've charged Kayla.

12:36.933 --> 12:39.267
- Perverting the
course of justice.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.500
Vicky Trovell said she'll speak
to the CPS if she cooperates.

12:42.533 --> 12:43.833
- I hope you told
Kayla what I said.

12:43.867 --> 12:46.100
- It's too late to
tell her anything.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.633
Don't you get it?

12:47.667 --> 12:49.067
She's a mother.

12:49.100 --> 12:49.767
She has a little boy.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.600
She'll do anything.

12:50.633 --> 12:52.633
She cannot be
separated from him.

12:54.700 --> 12:55.800
They're gonna come after you.

12:55.833 --> 12:58.200
- Well, they've
already tried that once.

13:00.733 --> 13:03.433
- Look, they think they've
got a witness, but they don't.

13:03.467 --> 13:05.733
Cos even if that person existed,
he wouldn't be around to go to

13:05.767 --> 13:06.700
court.

13:06.733 --> 13:09.333
You get me?

13:09.367 --> 13:10.333
- This is freaking me out.

13:10.367 --> 13:12.633
I can't do this.
- Listen, listen.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.833
I'm only giving you the picture
so you can give it to Kayla,

13:14.867 --> 13:15.700
yeah?

13:18.300 --> 13:20.467
- You know, I thought
we were going somewhere.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.533
Together.
- We still are.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.767
- Are you living in some
kind of parallel universe?

13:23.800 --> 13:24.733
- No.

13:24.767 --> 13:26.233
I'm living right next to you.

13:26.267 --> 13:28.667
- You and me, this can't work.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.667
- It can work.

13:30.700 --> 13:34.567
Tomorrow all this
will be over, yeah?

13:34.600 --> 13:37.467
And you and me, we can kick
back and do what we was doing.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.567
Tell me--

13:38.600 --> 13:39.600
Rhianna.

13:49.333 --> 13:49.767
- Yo.

13:49.867 --> 13:50.700
- Yo.

13:51.133 --> 13:52.467
You and me need to talk.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.767
Yeah, I think there's
a way in still.

13:55.800 --> 13:56.600
All right.

13:56.633 --> 13:58.633
Meet me there in
half an hour, then.

14:02.567 --> 14:03.100
That's five.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.633
Here you are.

14:05.267 --> 14:06.100
Keep it.

14:15.133 --> 14:16.800
Let me see your teeth.

14:18.067 --> 14:20.067
I don't wanna see the food.
Let me see your teeth.

14:29.867 --> 14:31.033
That's enough, man.

14:35.667 --> 14:39.200
Look, my mum, yeah...

14:39.233 --> 14:41.567
All she ever cared about
was fucking junk.

14:44.867 --> 14:48.033
Doesn't exactly set you up for
life, a mum like that, does it?

14:49.233 --> 14:51.233
You've gotta overcome all that.

14:52.233 --> 14:53.833
Trust me, Jase, you've gotta
make something of your life,

14:53.867 --> 14:56.033
even amongst all this shit.

14:57.067 --> 14:58.733
Know what I'm saying?

15:03.700 --> 15:05.700
Look, eat your food.
I'll be back.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.100
What you saying?

15:13.133 --> 15:15.267
So what's the deal
down at the warehouse?

15:15.300 --> 15:16.667
- There's a back
way in, you know.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.767
- Mm.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.267
When do you wanna do it?

15:20.300 --> 15:22.100
- Tomorrow night.

15:23.033 --> 15:24.567
- Bruv, I gotta go
and deal with Kayla.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.267
She's talking about cooperating.

15:28.267 --> 15:30.033
- Fuck.

15:30.067 --> 15:32.367
Should've buried that bitch that
night with Kamale, you know.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.233
- Well, don't worry about that.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.300
I'll deal with Kayla.

15:35.333 --> 15:38.333
Then we go and visit these
Albanian brothers, yeah?

15:49.800 --> 15:51.367
Yo, bruv.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.500
All right, listen, yeah?

15:52.533 --> 15:54.700
Apparently Kayla's got a child.

15:54.733 --> 15:56.700
Yeah, a little boy.

15:56.733 --> 15:58.733
He should come and
visit us, you get me?

15:59.400 --> 16:01.233
All right, fam, say no more.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.567

Miss Your Candyman" plays)

16:07.767 --> 16:10.667

* Until late next fall

17:00.400 --> 17:02.700
Gonna go see your
mum, yeah, Elijah?

17:02.733 --> 17:04.233
We're gonna go see your mummy.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.700
- You call the fucking police,

17:06.733 --> 17:07.600
his mum ain't gonna
see him again.

17:07.633 --> 17:09.400
You understand what
I'm saying to you?

17:09.433 --> 17:10.300
Do you understand?

17:10.333 --> 17:11.333
- Yeah.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.067
Hey, Elijah.

17:16.100 --> 17:18.067
Don't forget your dog.

17:18.100 --> 17:25.100
* I might not ever
come back at all *

17:43.333 --> 17:44.333
This cannot go on.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.433
This cannot go on.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.333
What do you want?

18:02.400 --> 18:04.133
- I wanna talk to Dushane.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.700
- Don't even try that
with me, little girl.

18:06.733 --> 18:07.600
You heard what I said.

18:07.633 --> 18:09.467
I said I wanna talk to Dushane.

18:11.567 --> 18:14.200
- Well, just tell him that Lisa
Smith wants to see him tonight,

18:14.233 --> 18:15.067
right?

18:18.233 --> 18:19.733
Right?

18:19.767 --> 18:20.767
- All right.

18:27.067 --> 18:28.233
What do you want?

18:30.667 --> 18:32.667
- Check this old woman
looking for beef.

18:35.833 --> 18:37.667
That's a pound.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.533
- Yeah, cheers.

18:44.233 --> 18:45.700
- Hi.
- This is for you.

18:45.733 --> 18:46.733
- Oh, no, I can't.

18:46.767 --> 18:47.633
- Please.

18:47.667 --> 18:48.667
It's free.

18:49.767 --> 18:50.600
- Thank you.

18:50.633 --> 18:52.100
That's kind.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.133
- You need to eat.
You look thin.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.533
- I don't even know
how to bring this up.

18:58.733 --> 19:00.633
Has Gem ever talked to
you about a Chinaman?

19:01.633 --> 19:02.400
- Yeah, Vincent.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.067
He owns the mini-market.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.100
- No.

19:06.367 --> 19:07.500
- I think you
should talk to Gem.

19:07.533 --> 19:08.800
- I'm sorry, I hope you don't

19:08.833 --> 19:11.000
think I'm interfering,

19:11.633 --> 19:14.233
but I think he's in some bad
trouble with Vincent.

19:14.267 --> 19:15.267
- This boy's always in trouble.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.267
What's wrong with him?

19:16.300 --> 19:20.800
- If it was me, I'd wanna know.

19:20.833 --> 19:21.767
I'm sorry. I have to take this.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.467
Sorry, sorry.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.300
Come in.

20:17.367 --> 20:18.567
You want a drink?

20:20.567 --> 20:22.000
- No, thank you.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.200
It's a nice place.

20:27.233 --> 20:28.733
- Yeah, it's all right.

20:29.667 --> 20:31.500
You can sit down, you know.

20:45.233 --> 20:47.067
How can I help you?

20:48.400 --> 20:50.533
- I need to...

20:50.567 --> 20:53.233
ask you for something.

20:53.267 --> 20:54.133
- All right.

20:54.167 --> 20:55.767
- But I don't wanna
owe you anything.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.500
I want you to do it for me and
then it's over and nobody ever

20:58.533 --> 21:02.400
talks about it again,
it's forgotten, done.

21:02.433 --> 21:04.400
- I think you do need
a drink, you know.

21:04.433 --> 21:06.267
- No, thank you.

21:08.467 --> 21:09.700
- Look, I...

21:09.733 --> 21:12.367
I can't agree to anything if I
don't know what it is, can I?

21:22.567 --> 21:23.633
The Chinaman?

21:23.667 --> 21:25.167
- Yeah, I know him.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.267
- He beat up Ra'Nell.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.333
He beat him up bad and...

21:35.367 --> 21:38.200
now he's after
Ra'Nell and his friend Gem.

21:38.233 --> 21:39.800
- So you want me to sort
out the Chinaman, then?

21:39.833 --> 21:41.500
- Not sort.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.433
Talk.

21:43.467 --> 21:44.800
I want you to talk to him.

21:44.833 --> 21:47.367
- All right, you want me
to talk to the Chinaman?

21:47.400 --> 21:49.300
I can do that.

21:49.333 --> 21:51.433
I'll have a word with him and,
trust me, once I've finished

21:51.467 --> 21:54.467
speaking to him, he won't go
near Ra'Nell again, all right?

22:04.500 --> 22:05.800
- I'd better leave.

22:05.833 --> 22:07.000
- All right.

22:08.600 --> 22:09.600
Lisa.

22:12.333 --> 22:13.467
There's still more left.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.500
Why don't you help me finish it?

22:16.633 --> 22:18.467
- I have to go.

22:31.067 --> 22:32.467
All right, it's
time for bed now, Erin.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.367
- No.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.233
- Don't you ever do
what you're told?

22:37.733 --> 22:39.167
Go to bed.

22:41.267 --> 22:42.500
- Don't matter.

22:42.533 --> 22:44.533
He can stay in Erin's room.
Cool.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.167
- No!

22:48.100 --> 22:48.767
No!

23:01.100 --> 23:02.233
- Yo.

23:02.267 --> 23:03.433
It's done, man.

23:22.233 --> 23:23.233
Gems!

23:26.467 --> 23:27.467
Gemel.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.533
Gemel.

23:33.067 --> 23:34.300
Hey, Gemel.

23:35.067 --> 23:36.733
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.600
Shit!

23:39.733 --> 23:41.167
Hey, hey, Gemel!

23:41.200 --> 23:42.200
Gemel!

23:43.700 --> 23:44.400
Hey.

23:44.433 --> 23:45.733
Come on.

23:45.767 --> 23:47.233
Hey, wake up.

23:47.267 --> 23:48.500
Hey, come on.

23:48.533 --> 23:49.533
- That's it.

23:50.067 --> 23:50.733
That's it.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.333
That's it.

24:19.633 --> 24:20.633
Gemel?

24:22.367 --> 24:23.567
The Chinaman?

24:35.233 --> 24:36.567
This problem...

24:37.667 --> 24:39.667
It's gonna be sorted out.

24:43.633 --> 24:45.467
- It's gonna get sorted.

24:47.433 --> 24:49.433
That's all you need to know.

24:53.733 --> 24:56.233
Then we're gonna
get back to normal.

25:47.533 --> 25:48.133
Hey!

25:48.167 --> 25:49.167
Hey, Michael!

25:51.600 --> 25:52.600
Come, man.

25:59.867 --> 26:01.533
What you saying, cuz?

26:03.200 --> 26:04.567
Are you all right, yeah?

26:07.100 --> 26:09.367
- You know, you
need some rum, fam.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.500
Trust me.

26:10.533 --> 26:11.533
Innit?

26:11.567 --> 26:13.100
You ever drank rum before?

26:13.133 --> 26:14.367
- No.

26:15.800 --> 26:16.433
- 12.

26:16.467 --> 26:19.100
- Ah, that's way too young.

26:19.133 --> 26:22.233
It would be irresponsible
if man gave you rum, fam.

26:22.267 --> 26:24.433
You'd be waved, you know, you'd
be all over the place, like

26:24.467 --> 26:27.600
staggering, chatting
bare sorts of stupid--

26:27.633 --> 26:29.133
No, man, not me.

26:29.167 --> 26:30.367
- Trust me, cuz.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.267
That's what happens when you
drink too much, fam, trust me.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.400
Innit?

26:33.433 --> 26:34.467
You get waved, bruv.

26:34.500 --> 26:37.167
You wake up the next morning
and think, 'Ugh...

26:37.200 --> 26:38.833
'What did I say last night?'

26:38.867 --> 26:41.167
Start regretting it and that,
but it's too late, bruv.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.700
It's done, innit?
What you said you said.

26:43.733 --> 26:47.467
Anyway, I need my best soldier
ready for today, you get me?

26:47.500 --> 26:49.100
So what you saying, you
got this flu thing or what?

26:49.133 --> 26:50.233
What you saying?

26:50.267 --> 26:51.300
- No, man, I'm cool.

26:51.333 --> 26:52.400
- Yeah.

26:52.433 --> 26:54.767
That's good, cos
Ben needs some food.

26:54.800 --> 26:57.300
Remember where Ben lives?

26:57.333 --> 26:59.200
- The big house with
all the books, innit?

26:59.233 --> 27:00.400
- That's the one.

27:00.433 --> 27:03.167
Yeah, you're gonna roll with
Collins today, anyway, yeah?

27:03.200 --> 27:05.433
Later on you grab the food, you
take it over to Ben and collect

27:05.467 --> 27:06.400
the right money.

27:06.433 --> 27:07.433
Simple.

27:08.567 --> 27:09.233
- All right, cool.

27:09.267 --> 27:10.500
How much?

27:10.533 --> 27:12.600
- 500.

27:12.633 --> 27:13.733
- Yeah.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.333
Say no more. Bless.

27:19.233 --> 27:20.067
- Come.

27:54.867 --> 27:56.667
- There's something
you need to tell Kayla.

27:56.700 --> 27:59.700
- I've said everything
I've got to say about that.

27:59.733 --> 28:01.500
I'm an officer of the court.

28:01.533 --> 28:02.367
I'm not in this with you.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.400
I'm not your co-conspirator.

28:08.567 --> 28:10.067
- That's Elijah.

28:11.067 --> 28:12.200
Kayla's kid.

28:12.233 --> 28:13.567
We've got him.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.267
- Oh, my God.
- Don't worry about it.

28:16.300 --> 28:17.800
He's all right. He's fine.

28:17.833 --> 28:20.133
He's safe.

28:20.167 --> 28:23.300
- As long as Kayla keeps her
mouth shut, Elijah goes home.

28:23.333 --> 28:26.167
All you've gotta do is help her
make the right decision, yeah?

28:27.233 --> 28:29.233
Call me when you talk to her.

28:50.867 --> 28:52.533
Oi, Ra'Nell!

28:52.567 --> 28:53.567
Ra'Nell!

28:58.700 --> 28:59.833
You cool?

28:59.867 --> 29:02.400
- My dad says we're
going today, innit?

29:03.133 --> 29:05.467
- Ramsgate, bruv, I told you.

29:06.433 --> 29:07.433
- Yeah, man.

29:09.633 --> 29:12.167
- Ramsgate...
- You can come on your holiday.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.267
It's got a beach.

29:14.500 --> 29:17.133
- Well, I don't know if it's
got a proper beach, but it's

29:17.167 --> 29:19.067
definitely by the sea.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.767
You can come visit me.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.600
- Yeah, all right.

29:26.533 --> 29:28.067
Gotta go, man.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.433
- All right, bruv. Just came
to say goodbye, innit?

29:42.333 --> 29:43.500
- Safe, bruv.

29:57.633 --> 29:59.467
Yo, bruv.

30:04.567 --> 30:06.567
I heard you like to
beat up kids, fam.

30:07.500 --> 30:08.733
- They lose my drugs.

30:08.767 --> 30:10.733
Old enough to deal, old
enough to deal with it.

30:10.767 --> 30:11.867
You don't know what
you're talking about.

30:11.900 --> 30:13.700
- You mean, I don't fucking know
what I'm talking about?

30:13.733 --> 30:15.100
Listen to what I'm
saying to you, yeah?

30:15.133 --> 30:16.500
- Eh...
- Shut up.

30:16.533 --> 30:18.733
You put your hand on Ra'Nell--
- Hey, hey!

30:18.767 --> 30:19.667
You Vincent?

30:19.700 --> 30:21.533
- Why does everyone
wanna know my name?

30:24.867 --> 30:26.500
- Leave my son alone!

30:26.533 --> 30:27.567
You understand me?

30:27.600 --> 30:30.200
You leave my son or I'll
cut your fucking head off!

30:30.233 --> 30:31.567
Get offa me!

30:32.133 --> 30:33.100
- Fucking madman.

30:33.133 --> 30:34.633
- I'll cut your
fucking face off!

30:34.667 --> 30:35.667
- Help!

30:37.433 --> 30:38.600
Help me!

30:39.700 --> 30:41.067
Help me!

30:41.100 --> 30:43.067
Someone help me!

30:43.100 --> 30:43.800
Help!

30:50.333 --> 30:52.000
- I thought about everything.

30:52.833 --> 30:54.333
I'm gonna cooperate.

30:56.833 --> 30:59.000
- There's something
you should know.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.533
Cool, fam.

31:26.567 --> 31:28.067
Now put it away.

31:29.467 --> 31:31.467
Right, let's go
and pick up Sully.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.600
- My client knows nothing
about the offenses

31:37.633 --> 31:39.300
which you put to her.

31:40.133 --> 31:42.133
She'll be making
no further comment.

31:57.600 --> 31:58.733
- It's gonna be OK.

31:58.767 --> 32:00.400
- Shut up.

32:00.433 --> 32:02.767
Don't even talk to
me, you fucking bitch.

32:06.067 --> 32:07.067
- One.

32:11.533 --> 32:13.133
- Hey, when are we
going Ben's yard?

32:13.167 --> 32:14.400
- Chill, blood.

32:21.267 --> 32:23.233
We've gotta go Dushane's first.

32:23.267 --> 32:24.267
Come.

32:32.833 --> 32:33.667
- Four bills there, fam.

32:33.700 --> 32:35.100
- All right, cool.
There's the keys.

32:35.133 --> 32:36.133
- Bless, fam.

32:37.333 --> 32:39.233
- Straight.

32:39.267 --> 32:40.533
Wagwan.

32:40.567 --> 32:41.733
Cool?

32:41.767 --> 32:42.533
Good?
- Yup.

32:42.567 --> 32:44.400
- Hear what I'm saying.

32:44.767 --> 32:45.700
This is my
boy, Shaheed.

32:45.733 --> 32:47.300
Stand up, bruv, you alright?

32:47.333 --> 32:49.167
Yeah, man,
good to see you.

32:52.067 --> 32:52.633
- Born ready.

32:52.667 --> 32:53.667
Yo.

32:55.400 --> 32:56.733
Well, how did it go?

32:57.867 --> 33:00.033
All right, I'm coming there now.

33:12.600 --> 33:13.633
- Ben.

33:13.667 --> 33:15.300
The guy we're meant to be
delivering the food to.

33:15.333 --> 33:16.667
- Oh, I don't know.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.200
- Bruv, I don't know, man.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.500
- Why don't you
call Dushane and ask?

33:25.533 --> 33:26.367
- Bruv, he texted me.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.133
He told us to wait
here at his yard.

33:30.833 --> 33:33.333
- Chill, man. What's with all
the fucking questions?

33:35.400 --> 33:36.400
Doors closing.

33:48.667 --> 33:50.667
- Kayla refused to cooperate.

33:51.567 --> 33:53.233
- She's a good girl.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.800
- Just tell me Elijah's
safe, please.

33:56.833 --> 33:58.233
Promise me that.

33:58.267 --> 33:59.433
- He's safe.

33:59.467 --> 34:01.133
He'll be home later.

34:02.633 --> 34:05.300
The feds say anything
about forensics?

34:05.333 --> 34:07.800
- No, they didn't find anything.

34:07.833 --> 34:12.267
- So, no Kayla, no
forensics, no nothing.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.533
- Well, you've
still got your witness.

34:13.567 --> 34:16.533
- No, don't worry about that.

34:16.567 --> 34:17.767
You did good, though.

34:20.267 --> 34:22.233
- You're gonna need to
find a new solicitor.

34:24.233 --> 34:26.300
I ain't changing.

34:26.333 --> 34:27.367
I've got Now Move On.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.400
She's the best there is, innit?

34:30.500 --> 34:32.367
And like I said, everything's
gone away now.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.833
- You kidnap a child.

34:33.867 --> 34:36.633
You coerce me into...

34:36.667 --> 34:37.900
It's all gone away?

34:37.933 --> 34:41.033
- Are you gonna let this fuck
up your whole end plan, yeah?

34:41.067 --> 34:43.167
You told me I need to
move on and step up.

34:43.200 --> 34:46.200
Now I'm telling you, you
need to do the same thing.

34:47.233 --> 34:49.733
And I'm the way you can do that.

34:49.767 --> 34:52.167
Rhianna, everyone sometimes in
their life has to do something

34:52.200 --> 34:54.200
wrong to get the right result.

34:54.233 --> 34:56.767
It ain't nice, but you gotta
do what you gotta do, innit?

34:57.700 --> 34:58.700
- No.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.367
You and me, we're not the same.

35:02.400 --> 35:06.400
- Babe, come on...
- Don't touch me.

35:29.300 --> 35:31.267
- The Kamale thing
has gone away.

35:31.300 --> 35:33.400
Yes!

35:33.433 --> 35:35.433
Thank fuck for that.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.333
Well, that's good news, no?

35:39.233 --> 35:40.233
- Yeah.

35:40.767 --> 35:41.767
Yeah, man.

37:16.633 --> 37:17.633
Oi!

37:18.100 --> 37:19.733
Yo!

37:19.767 --> 37:20.700
Don't fucking move.

37:20.733 --> 37:23.033
Don't move!
Don't fucking move!

37:23.067 --> 37:24.700
Move and I'll fucking
blow your head off!

37:24.733 --> 37:26.367
Hey, hey, listen.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.767
You know what we
come for, innit?

37:27.800 --> 37:28.633
Where is it?

37:29.067 --> 37:29.733
Where is it?

37:29.867 --> 37:30.700
Where is it?

37:31.100 --> 37:32.100
Where is it?

37:32.133 --> 37:33.300
Where the fuck is it?

37:56.133 --> 37:57.033
Yo!

37:57.067 --> 37:58.733
Ay, what we saying?

38:00.067 --> 38:00.800
We're good.

38:10.467 --> 38:11.467
Pussies.

38:13.300 --> 38:14.500
Get in, get in.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.467
We all good?

38:27.300 --> 38:29.300
- All good, fam, all good.

38:31.300 --> 38:32.600
Nice.

38:32.633 --> 38:33.800
- Yeah, spike me.

38:33.833 --> 38:35.000
Yes.

38:41.367 --> 38:43.700
- Oh, my God. Come here.

39:02.333 --> 39:05.433
- Didn't even have to
bury anyone this time.

39:05.467 --> 39:07.200
Told you.

39:07.233 --> 39:09.067
- Unbeatable, fam.

39:13.533 --> 39:15.333
So what you saying?

39:15.367 --> 39:18.200
Men gonna run Summerhouse
together again, yeah?

39:20.800 --> 39:24.300
- Look, that stunt
you pulled with Mike...

39:27.733 --> 39:30.233
...just can't forgive that.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.500
Bless, blood.

40:22.333 --> 40:24.167
So that's it, then.

40:28.333 --> 40:29.533
Later.

40:29.567 --> 40:31.400
- See you, babe.

40:45.133 --> 40:46.633
You all right?

40:52.300 --> 40:54.300
Come, let's go.

41:12.267 --> 41:13.267
Gemel!

41:18.533 --> 41:20.133
You packed your things?

41:20.167 --> 41:21.100
- Yeah.

41:21.133 --> 41:22.433
- Good.

41:22.467 --> 41:24.633
Train leaves in 20 minutes.

41:24.667 --> 41:26.500
That ends that, OK?

41:36.767 --> 41:38.600
Check that, fam.

41:40.333 --> 41:42.533
Helping you feed your peoples.

41:42.567 --> 41:44.467
You'd better make sure
this keeps the peace.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.500
- You know Sully's
setting up in Hoxton, innit?

41:46.533 --> 41:47.333
Yeah, so what?

41:47.367 --> 41:48.433
It's his business.

41:48.467 --> 41:51.233
- Fam, it'll be your business
too soon, you know.

41:51.267 --> 41:53.600
Sully don't like no
competition, fam.

41:54.767 --> 41:56.400
- You got your food.

41:56.433 --> 41:57.433
Move on.

41:59.833 --> 42:01.000
What about Michael?

42:01.500 --> 42:02.767
Want me to do it?

42:02.800 --> 42:04.633
I know you like the youth, man.

42:06.433 --> 42:07.433
- Don't worry about that.

42:07.467 --> 42:08.800
I'll deal with it.

42:09.433 --> 42:10.767
It's gotta be done.

42:17.767 --> 42:19.600
This game
is shit, man.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.033
- Why you go and chuck
it on the floor for?

42:26.833 --> 42:28.333
- It's Dushane's.

42:36.267 --> 42:37.600
- Shut up.

43:18.167 --> 43:20.000
Relax, man.

45:16.667 --> 45:17.667
- Dushane!

45:19.167 --> 45:20.167
Dushane!

45:21.433 --> 45:22.267
Dusha--
