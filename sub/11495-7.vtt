00:02.220 --> 00:03.234
What are you
doing here?

00:03.235 --> 00:04.335
I got a weekend pass,

00:04.337 --> 00:05.919
so I took a train in
to surprise you guys.

00:05.921 --> 00:07.788
Hi, soldier.
Hello.

00:07.790 --> 00:08.956
You must be Jake.

00:08.958 --> 00:10.257
I'm sleeping in your room.

00:10.259 --> 00:12.209
Well, God bless America.

00:12.211 --> 00:13.410
You are just so sweet.

00:13.412 --> 00:15.212
I swear, I could just
eat you up,

00:15.214 --> 00:17.298
but you know, then
I'd probably get a sugar rush.

00:18.216 --> 00:19.249
Missi still sleeping?

00:19.251 --> 00:21.185
Nah, she's in the shower.

00:23.638 --> 00:25.756
Oops.

00:26.524 --> 00:27.908
I get another pass
in, like, a month,

00:27.910 --> 00:29.393
so maybe we can
see each other then.

00:29.395 --> 00:30.995
I sort of have a boyfriend.

00:30.997 --> 00:32.128
A boyfriend?

00:32.131 --> 00:34.431
But I thought you...

00:35.350 --> 00:37.551
Good-bye, Jake.

00:37.553 --> 00:39.019
Don't be a hero.

00:39.021 --> 00:40.904
(door closes)

00:40.906 --> 00:44.325
What the hell just happened?

00:47.128 --> 00:48.429
Hey.

00:48.431 --> 00:50.381
Hey.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.949
Wait. I thought you had a date
with Lyndsey tonight.

00:52.951 --> 00:54.468
Oh, yeah, I was
supposed to,

00:54.470 --> 00:56.704
but, uh, we decided to
take a little break.

00:56.706 --> 00:58.255
How come?

00:58.257 --> 01:00.424
Oh, I'm not privy
to that information.

01:00.426 --> 01:01.925
(clears his throat)

01:01.927 --> 01:04.444
Uh, all I was told is,
we need to take a break.

01:04.447 --> 01:06.680
So, what, you're supposed
to just wait around

01:06.682 --> 01:08.265
until she decides
that you're worthy

01:08.267 --> 01:09.817
of being in her
presence again?

01:09.819 --> 01:12.486
Or until she needs her
rain gutters cleaned out.

01:12.488 --> 01:14.738
And-and that's
not a euphemism.

01:16.541 --> 01:17.941
See, this is the kind of crap

01:17.943 --> 01:20.244
you got to put up with
when you're in a relationship.

01:20.246 --> 01:23.247
Oh, but-but it's a small
price to pay for love,

01:23.249 --> 01:25.783
companionship and
a parking spot

01:25.785 --> 01:28.886
for the pink Prius.

01:28.888 --> 01:33.057
It's hard to believe that
Lyndsey needed a break from you.

01:35.510 --> 01:37.544
(doorbell rings)

01:37.546 --> 01:40.247
Oh. Well, if you will excuse me,

01:40.249 --> 01:44.134
I have a date
with an extra large meat lover.

01:44.136 --> 01:46.103
That did not sound right.

01:47.305 --> 01:48.722
I ordered a pizza.

01:51.142 --> 01:53.310
Walden!

01:53.312 --> 01:54.945
Missi.

01:55.814 --> 01:57.698
I am so sorry

01:57.700 --> 01:59.550
to show up
unannounced, but

01:59.552 --> 02:01.351
me and my mom got
in this huge fight over

02:01.353 --> 02:03.120
whether or not I should pay rent
to stay at her house.

02:03.122 --> 02:04.738
And I said,
"Fine, but if I pay rent,

02:04.740 --> 02:05.856
then your stupid boyfriend
should, too."

02:05.858 --> 02:07.040
He said,
"Don't sass your mother."

02:07.042 --> 02:08.459
I said,
"Do not tell me what to do.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.660
I am six months older than you""

02:09.662 --> 02:11.128
Anyway,

02:11.130 --> 02:13.630
you said I was welcome here
any time I want, so, ding-dong,

02:13.632 --> 02:15.082
here I am.
Uh...

02:15.084 --> 02:16.550
Alan, how are you?

02:16.552 --> 02:18.969
I'm good.
What brings you here?

02:18.971 --> 02:20.537
Me and my...
No! No!

02:22.674 --> 02:24.374
Hey.

02:24.376 --> 02:25.676
Jake, what
are you doing here?

02:25.678 --> 02:28.328
I got a weekend pass. Missi?

02:28.330 --> 02:30.514
What are you doing here?

02:30.516 --> 02:34.151
Jake? What a surprise!

02:37.889 --> 02:39.723
I'm suspicious.

02:39.725 --> 02:41.108

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

02:56.535 --> 02:58.451
I still can't get over
this coincidence.

02:58.453 --> 03:00.303
I mean, what are the odds?

03:00.305 --> 03:03.223
The same weekend I come home,
Missi just happens...

03:03.225 --> 03:04.507
Jake, let it go.

03:04.509 --> 03:06.226
WALDEN:
Missi,

03:06.228 --> 03:08.511
help me out here.
I thought you guys broke up.

03:08.513 --> 03:11.514
We did, but then Jake sent me
this giant cookie he baked

03:11.516 --> 03:14.634
that was shaped like a heart,
and it said, "I Missi you""

03:14.636 --> 03:16.186
and I just melted.

03:16.188 --> 03:18.939
Well, you know,
I can't take all the credit.

03:18.941 --> 03:20.390
The cookie was
loaded with pot.

03:20.392 --> 03:22.175
MISSI:
So, uh,

03:22.177 --> 03:25.612
Jake, you want to go to
your bedroom and unpack?

03:25.614 --> 03:27.697
Uh, that's okay.
I don't really have much.

03:28.833 --> 03:33.987
Well, then maybe you
can help <i>me...</i> unpack.

03:33.989 --> 03:35.255
Why?

03:35.257 --> 03:36.907
WALDEN:
Dude,

03:36.909 --> 03:40.493
she's not really talking
about unpacking.

03:40.495 --> 03:43.013
Oh. Oh, okay, yeah,

03:43.015 --> 03:45.215
I could definitely go
for a good unpacking.

03:45.217 --> 03:46.967
Well, then, come on.

03:46.969 --> 03:50.220
Hey, um, maybe later we could go
for a walk on the beach.

03:50.222 --> 03:51.938
Oh, yeah!

03:52.773 --> 03:56.109
She means an actual walk
on the beach!

03:57.478 --> 03:58.862
That's it.
I'm out of here.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.030
Where you going?

04:00.032 --> 04:01.214
Someplace quiet.

04:01.216 --> 04:02.983
What are you talking about?
It's quiet here.

04:02.985 --> 04:04.784
Wait for it.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.119
MISSI:
Jake, slow down.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.538
There's a zipper
on this thing.

04:08.540 --> 04:12.042
Oh, God, I can't hear my son
having sex.

Wow.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.652
(whispers):
Excuse me?

04:38.654 --> 04:42.155
I'm sorry.
That-that was involuntary.

04:43.557 --> 04:44.975
I just think
you're very beautiful.

04:44.977 --> 04:48.244
Thank you.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.580
If we weren't in a library,
I would have applauded.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.582
Got it.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.334
Thanks.

04:56.904 --> 04:58.872
I'm sorry.

04:58.874 --> 05:01.024
What are you doing here?

05:01.876 --> 05:03.943
Nobody goes
to the library anymore.

05:03.945 --> 05:07.063
Oh, it's one of the few places
that I can go to

05:07.065 --> 05:09.082
where strange men
don't hit on me.

05:09.084 --> 05:10.350
Oh.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.801
<i>Oh.</i>

05:12.853 --> 05:14.921
Sorry. I just...
I'll leave you alone.

05:17.892 --> 05:20.560
I come here 'cause
they have a great collection

05:20.562 --> 05:22.729
of Thomas Edison diaries.

05:22.731 --> 05:24.931
They're very illuminating.

05:27.018 --> 05:28.268
Get it?

05:28.270 --> 05:29.836
Thomas Edison's...

05:29.838 --> 05:31.371
The lightbulb?

05:32.740 --> 05:34.040
Never mind.

05:35.376 --> 05:37.327
(sighs)

05:37.329 --> 05:40.180
Just for the record,
I wasn't hitting on you.

05:40.182 --> 05:42.866
I was just making small talk.

05:42.868 --> 05:45.752
Duly noted.

05:45.754 --> 05:48.254
The last thing I would want
to do is hit on anyone.

05:48.256 --> 05:50.423
I'm-I'm kind of taking
a timeout from the whole

05:50.425 --> 05:52.509
boy-meets-girl,
girl-dumps-boy,

05:52.511 --> 05:55.428
boy-doubts-his-worth
as-a-human-being thing.

05:55.430 --> 05:57.397
Okay.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.681
Okay.

06:19.203 --> 06:22.488
Oh, for God's sake.
Would you like to join me?

06:22.490 --> 06:23.873
Oh, no, no, no.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.959
I don't want to impose.
Just get over here.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.980
I'm Walden.

06:30.982 --> 06:33.083
Whitney.
Hi.

06:33.085 --> 06:34.634
So, Whitney,
tell me about yourself.

06:34.636 --> 06:35.969
What do you do?

06:35.971 --> 06:37.720
Um, I'm an actress.

06:37.722 --> 06:39.589
Oh, yeah. How's that going?

06:39.591 --> 06:41.024
Not so good.

06:41.026 --> 06:43.276
I haven't worked
in almost two years.

06:43.278 --> 06:47.130
Ooh. Tough business,
or are you just not talented?

06:51.786 --> 06:54.521
What do you mean,
am I just not talented?

06:54.523 --> 06:56.106
You don't know me,

06:56.108 --> 06:57.707
you don't know what I can do.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.193
You're lucky that I don't reach
under this table right now,

07:00.195 --> 07:02.695
rip off your balls
and feed them to you for dinner.

07:02.697 --> 07:06.199
I'm sorry. Sorry. My bad.

07:07.034 --> 07:09.752
And scene.

07:16.427 --> 07:18.628
Hey.
Hey.

07:18.630 --> 07:19.896
Where's Missi?

07:19.898 --> 07:21.547
She's unpacking.

07:21.549 --> 07:23.266
You know, for real.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.718
Right. I'm-I'm glad
you're having fun.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.655
Oh, I am. I can't imagine
ever being with anyone else.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.890
Yeah, yeah, I
remember that feeling.

07:30.892 --> 07:34.077
You, uh, kiss a girl,
see fireworks,

07:34.079 --> 07:35.778
and fall head-over-heels
in love,

07:35.780 --> 07:39.082
and then, one day you wake up
in a cold, loveless marriage

07:39.084 --> 07:40.566
with a soul-sucking shrew

07:40.568 --> 07:43.153
who makes you wish
for an early death.

07:43.155 --> 07:46.422
Oh, you realize
you're talking about my mother.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.542
Yeah. So you get it.

07:52.179 --> 07:54.797
So, anyway, after I
moved out to Los Angeles,

07:54.799 --> 07:56.216
I promised myself

07:56.218 --> 07:59.269
I'd give it two years,
and if I wasn't a star by then,

07:59.271 --> 08:00.970
I'd move home
and get a real job.

08:00.972 --> 08:02.922
So, how much time
do you have left?

08:02.924 --> 08:04.357
11 days.

08:04.359 --> 08:08.061
Well, that's four more
than God took.

08:08.063 --> 08:10.980
God didn't have my agent.

08:10.982 --> 08:14.317
Listen, if I could hire you
to act, I would.

08:14.319 --> 08:16.769
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

08:18.438 --> 08:21.524
You know,
what if I <i>could</i> hire you?

08:21.526 --> 08:23.026
For what?

08:23.028 --> 08:24.294
Well, stick with me

08:24.296 --> 08:26.229
'cause I'm just thinking
out loud here.

08:26.231 --> 08:28.464
You see, here's the thing.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.383
I'm a serial monogamist,

08:30.385 --> 08:33.086
but I'm not very good
at relationships,

08:33.087 --> 08:35.004
'cause they're emotional,

08:35.006 --> 08:37.307
and they get messy,
people fall in and out of love,

08:37.308 --> 08:38.924
and somebody always
ends up crying.

08:38.927 --> 08:40.458
That's usually me.

08:40.461 --> 08:43.645
Walden, I'm not going
to date you.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.249
Oh, no, I-I don't want you
to date me.

08:46.251 --> 08:48.134
What if

08:48.136 --> 08:52.138
I hired you to play the role
of my girlfriend?

08:52.140 --> 08:53.472
You think I'm a hooker?!

08:53.474 --> 08:55.141
No.

08:55.143 --> 08:56.276
No. No sex.

08:56.278 --> 08:58.361
Uh, you know,
take sex off the table.

08:58.363 --> 09:00.096
In fact, take it off the table,

09:00.098 --> 09:01.748
the car, the floor, the bed,

09:01.750 --> 09:04.067
the windmill
at the putt-putt golf course.

09:04.069 --> 09:06.286
Okay, so,

09:06.288 --> 09:08.955
I'm supposed to just believe
that some random guy

09:08.957 --> 09:12.008
that I meet in the public
library is going to pay me

09:12.010 --> 09:14.043
to be his sex-free companion?

09:15.329 --> 09:17.380
How does this not end
with my head in a freezer?

09:19.133 --> 09:21.134
Google me.

09:21.136 --> 09:22.268
What?

09:22.270 --> 09:24.604
Walden Schmidt.
Google me.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.727
Wow, that's a lot of zeros.

09:31.895 --> 09:36.916
Are you really a-a genius,
entrepreneur, philanthropist?

09:36.918 --> 09:39.352
I also fight crime.

09:40.521 --> 09:41.487
What do you say?

09:41.489 --> 09:43.856
You know
how weird this is, right?

09:43.858 --> 09:45.291
What is weird about wanting

09:45.293 --> 09:47.193
to control every aspect
of a relationship

09:47.195 --> 09:48.945
by using money as a weapon?

09:50.264 --> 09:51.998
Okay, let me rephrase that.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.916
How does five grand
a week sound?

09:53.918 --> 09:55.752
Sounds like
you've got a girlfriend.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.040
Morning.

10:01.042 --> 10:03.393
Morning. Where's Jake?

10:03.395 --> 10:05.061
Oh, he's still sleeping,
'cause in the army,

10:05.063 --> 10:07.347
he has to get up at
4:00 in the morning.

10:07.349 --> 10:08.831
In the military,
that's 0400.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.650
I don't understand why they need
the "oh" or the "hundred."

10:10.652 --> 10:11.734
What time is it?

10:11.736 --> 10:13.653
4:00. Boom!
Done! Next!

10:13.655 --> 10:14.854
(doorbell rings)

10:14.856 --> 10:16.155
And I really
don't understand

10:16.157 --> 10:17.774
them watches without
the numbers on it.

10:17.776 --> 10:19.942
I mean, I never know what time it...
Missi?

10:19.944 --> 10:23.112
I love you dearly,
but you got to shut up.

10:23.114 --> 10:26.332
Well, all I heard was,
you love me dearly.

10:28.735 --> 10:30.203
Oh, you're here.

10:30.904 --> 10:33.172
And... action!

10:34.041 --> 10:36.175
You're adorable.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.995
I brought you an iced coffee,
no sugar, soy milk.

10:38.997 --> 10:41.180
That's exactly the way
that I like it.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.548
How did you know?

10:42.550 --> 10:43.850
You're my boyfriend.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.918
It's my business to know.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.520
Okay, so, here's
what I'm thinking.

10:47.522 --> 10:50.573
Three words--
beer, wings, football.

10:50.575 --> 10:52.558
Okay, three more words--

10:52.560 --> 10:54.677
best... girlfriend... ever.

10:54.679 --> 10:56.996
I'll just go get changed.
Why?

10:56.998 --> 10:59.232
Oh, this is a smelly old
shirt, and I haven't showered.

10:59.234 --> 11:01.567
Stinky-- just the way I like it.

11:01.569 --> 11:03.619
Oh, this is good.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.157
Can I fart in the car?

11:12.563 --> 11:14.113
Hello?

11:14.115 --> 11:15.298
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.383
Is this the residence
of Private Jake Harper?

11:17.385 --> 11:19.385
Yes, it is.
Is everything okay?

11:19.387 --> 11:21.687
No, sir.
He's absent without leave.

11:21.689 --> 11:23.423
H-He's AWOL?

11:23.425 --> 11:25.391
Now we both said it.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.977
If he doesn't return
to the base within 24 hours,

11:27.979 --> 11:30.096
he will be brought up
on charges.

11:30.098 --> 11:32.248
Oh. That's not good.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.934
No, sir. It's bad.

11:34.936 --> 11:37.470
Uh, well, I-I...
I haven't seen him.

11:37.472 --> 11:40.356
Uh, but, you know, if I...
if I do, I will, uh,

11:40.358 --> 11:42.191
I will get in
touch right away.

11:42.193 --> 11:43.259
Uh, immediately.

11:43.261 --> 11:44.310
Thank you, sir.
Okay.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.578
Here's our contact
information.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.163
Good day, sir.

11:51.468 --> 11:54.487
MISSI (giggling):
Jake!

11:54.489 --> 11:56.172
Jake?

11:56.174 --> 11:58.758
JAKE:
Not <i>now,</i> Dad.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.177
The military police
were at the door

12:01.179 --> 12:03.045
looking for you.

12:03.047 --> 12:05.765
What did you tell them?
I told them you weren't here.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.666
Oh. Thanks.
See you at dinner.

12:19.634 --> 12:22.719
Are you kidding
me, Jake? AWOL?!

12:22.721 --> 12:24.404
Come on, it's not
that big a deal.

12:24.406 --> 12:26.523
You could go to jail!

12:26.525 --> 12:27.808
Really?

12:27.810 --> 12:31.228
That seems a
little extreme.

12:31.230 --> 12:32.946
All right, all right, enough.
Just go get your things,

12:32.948 --> 12:34.314
and I'll drive you back
to the base.

12:34.316 --> 12:36.066
No. I'm staying
here with Missi.

12:36.068 --> 12:38.118
This is not a discussion.
Let's go!

12:38.120 --> 12:39.870
Dad, I'm not a kid anymore.

12:39.872 --> 12:41.705
I'm 18, and I'm in the army.

12:41.707 --> 12:45.792
You're using the excuse
that you're in the army

12:45.794 --> 12:47.427
to not go back to the army?!

12:47.429 --> 12:50.547
Hey, why don't you let me
go try to talk to him?

12:50.549 --> 12:52.049
You think you can bring him
back to his senses?

12:52.051 --> 12:54.234
Oh, yeah, I'm real good at getting
people to do what I want 'em to do--

12:54.282 --> 12:56.253
back home they call me
the "People Whisperer""

12:56.255 --> 12:57.387
It's kind of like
the Horse Whisperer,

12:57.389 --> 12:58.455
except I do it
with people

12:58.457 --> 12:59.473
and I don't really
whisper. Ooh,

12:59.475 --> 13:00.807
I tried it with
a horse one time.

13:00.809 --> 13:02.309
He was just looking
at me like I was crazy.

13:02.311 --> 13:03.677
Kind of like you're
doing right now.

13:03.679 --> 13:06.313
I'll go talk to Jake.

13:07.298 --> 13:10.817
She cannot become
my daughter-in-law.

13:13.605 --> 13:15.105
Oh, good, you're
going back.

13:15.107 --> 13:17.658
Nope. You and me
are getting out of here.

13:17.660 --> 13:18.842
Where are we going?

13:18.844 --> 13:19.809
Doesn't matter.

13:19.811 --> 13:20.977
I just want to be with you.

13:20.979 --> 13:23.664
Jake, I got to go back home;
I have a job.

13:23.666 --> 13:26.416
Hey, if I can leave the army,
you can leave your job.

13:26.418 --> 13:27.701
Whoa, slow down.

13:27.703 --> 13:31.038
Why? I love you
and you love me, right?

13:32.457 --> 13:34.424
Right?

13:34.426 --> 13:35.926
Jake...

13:35.928 --> 13:39.346
you have to know
how much I really like you.

13:39.348 --> 13:41.815
Oh, man.

13:41.817 --> 13:43.033
But...

13:43.035 --> 13:44.351
you're in good company,

13:44.353 --> 13:47.137
'cause I only really like
great things.

13:47.139 --> 13:48.839
You know, like
ice cream sundaes

13:48.841 --> 13:50.774
and jumping up and
down on bubble wrap

13:50.776 --> 13:52.859
and that cute little bear
in the toilet paper commercial

13:52.861 --> 13:54.861
that wipes his butt
on the trees.

13:54.863 --> 13:58.682
Okay, I heard it that time.
I <i>do</i> got to shut up.

13:58.684 --> 14:01.902
(cheering, whooping)

14:01.904 --> 14:04.538
I brought you another beer.
(groans)

14:04.540 --> 14:06.073
I don't know if I should.

14:06.075 --> 14:07.874
Oh, come on, drunk guys are hot.

14:07.876 --> 14:10.193
You know,
I got to tell you, Whitney,

14:10.195 --> 14:12.796
I am having
the best time with you.

14:12.798 --> 14:16.633
Good. 'Cause...
I think you're wonderful.

14:16.635 --> 14:18.802
Thanks.

14:20.588 --> 14:22.673
Do you really mean that?

14:22.675 --> 14:23.640
Of course I do.

14:23.642 --> 14:25.726
You're smart,
you're funny,

14:25.728 --> 14:28.345
not to mention very handsome.

14:28.347 --> 14:30.147
Ah. Too late,
you mentioned it.

14:30.149 --> 14:31.648
(laughs)

14:31.650 --> 14:33.684
You know, but seriously...

14:33.686 --> 14:35.852
I am so glad I met you.

14:35.854 --> 14:37.437
Thanks.

14:37.439 --> 14:39.272
Me, too.

14:41.993 --> 14:45.245
See, here's the thing.

14:45.247 --> 14:47.164
I really mean it.

14:47.166 --> 14:48.582
So do I.

14:48.584 --> 14:50.734
Okay, see, I don't know
if you're just saying that

14:50.736 --> 14:51.918
because I'm paying you,

14:51.920 --> 14:54.204
or if you really believe it.

14:54.206 --> 14:56.623
How does it feel to you?

14:57.458 --> 14:59.209
It feels like you mean it.

14:59.211 --> 15:01.712
Then that's all that matters.

15:01.714 --> 15:03.513
Wh... No, it's not.

15:03.515 --> 15:06.099
See... I want to know

15:06.101 --> 15:08.251
if it's for <i>real</i> real

15:08.253 --> 15:10.920
or if it's "Best Performance
by a Girlfriend

15:10.922 --> 15:13.256
Hired in a Library" real.

15:13.258 --> 15:16.009
Because on my end, it is real.

15:16.011 --> 15:17.894
Me, too.

15:17.896 --> 15:20.447
Okay, if I wasn't paying you,

15:20.449 --> 15:22.566
would you still feel that?

15:22.568 --> 15:25.902
It wouldn't matter
if you were paying me or not.

15:25.904 --> 15:27.154
But I <i>am</i> paying you.

15:27.156 --> 15:30.373
Which doesn't change
the way I feel.

15:30.375 --> 15:31.458
(sucking lip)

15:31.460 --> 15:33.410
Okay, let's try this
another way.

15:34.829 --> 15:38.048
I want you to feel

15:38.050 --> 15:40.250
that it's really real...

15:40.252 --> 15:42.669
for <i>real</i> real.

15:42.671 --> 15:43.837
And that...

15:43.839 --> 15:46.256
is exactly how I feel.

15:47.124 --> 15:48.425
Son of a bitch!

15:55.149 --> 15:56.433
Hey.

15:56.435 --> 15:58.068
Hey.

15:58.070 --> 15:59.069
You okay?

15:59.071 --> 16:00.704
What do you care?

16:00.706 --> 16:02.773
Come on, Jake, you know I care.

16:02.775 --> 16:05.442
I feel so stupid.

16:05.444 --> 16:06.793
No.

16:06.795 --> 16:09.579
You're not stupid.

16:11.382 --> 16:12.833
You want to hear stupid?

16:12.835 --> 16:15.485
One time I drank an entire
blueberry Slurpee in one slurp,

16:15.487 --> 16:18.622
had a three-hour brain freeze
and my pee looked like Windex.

16:18.624 --> 16:20.507
What the hell
are you talking about?

16:20.509 --> 16:23.343
I don't know,
I'm not real good with silence.

16:23.345 --> 16:27.214
Just... promise me
you'll go back to the army.

16:27.216 --> 16:29.716
Yeah, I'm going back.

16:29.718 --> 16:31.334
Good.

16:32.670 --> 16:35.672
Hey... we did have
some fun, though, right?

16:35.674 --> 16:37.808
Yeah, we did.

16:37.810 --> 16:41.111
Well, just remember that part.

16:45.399 --> 16:47.367
Good-bye, Jake.

16:59.196 --> 17:02.916
Where am I gonna find
another girl named Missi?

17:06.369 --> 17:08.171
Hey.

17:08.173 --> 17:09.723
Hey.

17:09.724 --> 17:11.875
Where's your new girlfriend?

17:11.877 --> 17:14.728
Ah, she's off
for the day.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.346
Where's your boyfriend?

17:16.348 --> 17:19.098
We... kind of broke up.

17:19.101 --> 17:20.650
How come?

17:20.652 --> 17:24.186
You know, I just thought I was
coming here for a fun weekend,

17:24.189 --> 17:25.739
no strings attached, but...

17:25.741 --> 17:27.824
then Jake told me
that he loved me

17:27.826 --> 17:29.559
and I just couldn't say it back.

17:29.561 --> 17:30.660
Ouch.

17:30.662 --> 17:32.061
I wasn't trying to hurt him.

17:32.063 --> 17:34.247
It's just...

17:34.249 --> 17:36.433
he's not my soul mate.

17:36.435 --> 17:39.068
Well, I hate to break it to you,

17:39.070 --> 17:41.872
but... there is no such thing.

17:41.874 --> 17:42.956
That's not true.

17:42.958 --> 17:45.175
Everybody has a soul mate.

17:45.177 --> 17:46.509
And when
you find yours,

17:46.511 --> 17:47.611
it's like that feeling you get

17:47.613 --> 17:49.179
after the first big
snowfall of the year.

17:49.181 --> 17:51.264
You race outside
to go sledding

17:51.266 --> 17:53.683
and you go to the top of
the steepest hill you can find,

17:53.685 --> 17:55.969
and, you know, your heart starts
racing and you get all sweaty,

17:55.971 --> 17:57.504
even though all your boogers
are frozen over,

17:57.506 --> 17:59.489
and... the next
thing you know,

17:59.491 --> 18:00.974
you are zipping down
Montague Street,

18:00.976 --> 18:03.360
laughing and crying
all at the same time,

18:03.362 --> 18:05.228
and you never want it to end.

18:05.230 --> 18:07.664
And that's what real love
should feel like.

18:08.966 --> 18:11.801
Nobody should settle
for anything less.

18:11.803 --> 18:14.588
Remember when I told you
to shut up earlier?

18:14.590 --> 18:15.956
I'm sorry. I know.

18:15.958 --> 18:17.607
No.

18:17.609 --> 18:20.377
Don't ever listen to me again.

18:21.295 --> 18:23.430
'Cause that was awesome.

18:26.634 --> 18:27.968
Where you going?

18:27.970 --> 18:29.803
I'm gonna go see
if my girlfriend

18:29.805 --> 18:32.973
wants to really
be my girlfriend.

18:34.075 --> 18:37.077
And the People Whisperer
strikes again.

18:40.481 --> 18:42.298
And we're flying
down the hill

18:42.300 --> 18:43.600
and you're all sweaty

18:43.602 --> 18:45.852
and there are, like,
boogers frozen everywhere,

18:45.854 --> 18:47.821
and... the point is,

18:47.823 --> 18:50.657
is I want to share
that feeling with <i>you.</i>

18:51.742 --> 18:53.643
For real.

18:54.495 --> 18:56.813
I'm gay.

18:58.315 --> 18:59.666
What?

18:59.668 --> 19:02.252
I like women.

19:02.254 --> 19:04.204
For real?

19:04.206 --> 19:06.656
For real.

19:06.658 --> 19:08.008
Wow.

19:08.010 --> 19:10.493
You're a really good actor.

19:12.046 --> 19:13.346
Thank you.

19:13.348 --> 19:15.265
Hey, do you want to go
to a movie tomorrow?

19:15.267 --> 19:17.133
Sure, yeah.
That sounds great.

19:17.135 --> 19:18.334
Okay.

19:18.336 --> 19:19.519
I love you.

19:19.521 --> 19:20.520
Love you, too, honey!

19:20.522 --> 19:23.356
♪ <i>Men...</i> ♪

19:31.155 --> 19:32.690
You all right, buddy?

19:32.691 --> 19:35.358
I'm fine.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.327
It's okay to be upset.

19:37.329 --> 19:40.480
I'm not upset.
Well...

19:40.482 --> 19:43.767
if you were, I-I
would understand.

19:43.769 --> 19:46.369
I mean, you give
yourself to somebody,

19:46.371 --> 19:49.456
you finally let down
all your walls, and...

19:49.458 --> 19:51.708
then they break
your heart.

19:52.543 --> 19:54.211
Yeah.

19:54.213 --> 19:57.330
I'm really sorry
you have to go through this.

19:57.332 --> 19:58.932
I mean...

19:58.934 --> 20:02.469
it just... it kills me
to see you in pain.

20:02.471 --> 20:05.222
I mean, I-I know
you're a soldier now,

20:05.224 --> 20:08.859
but... you're still
my little baby boy.

20:08.861 --> 20:11.528
You know, I-I remember bringing
you home from the hospital,

20:11.530 --> 20:14.448
(choked up): wrapped in your...
fuzzy blue blanket.

20:14.450 --> 20:15.982
(sniffles)

20:15.984 --> 20:19.352
(crying):
I love you so much.

20:19.354 --> 20:21.488
I just...
I-I just wish

20:21.490 --> 20:23.323
I hurt instead
of you.

20:23.325 --> 20:25.692
Dad... it's okay.

20:25.694 --> 20:27.210
No, no, it's not okay!

20:27.212 --> 20:29.379
It's not.
Maybe I should drive.

20:29.381 --> 20:31.965
Yeah, yeah, that's
a good idea.

20:31.967 --> 20:34.384
Thank you.

20:34.386 --> 20:36.470
All I'm saying is,
you can't give up.

20:36.472 --> 20:38.472
Your soul mate's
out there.

20:38.474 --> 20:39.706
Yeah, I don't know, Missi.

20:39.708 --> 20:41.925
You just got to keep
your eyes and your heart open.

20:41.927 --> 20:43.643
You know, you never know
where you're gonna find her.

20:43.645 --> 20:44.811
She could be anywhere
right now. Hey,

20:44.813 --> 20:46.596
she might even be
at a Costco, wearing a apron,

20:46.598 --> 20:48.598
passing out egg rolls, so you
can sample the dipping sauce.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.884
Little tip:
avoid the Chinese mustard.

20:50.886 --> 20:54.053
Feels good going in,
not so good coming out.

20:54.055 --> 20:56.777
Let's just hope I find
her before I get old.

20:56.802 --> 20:57.692
Ooh, then you

20:57.693 --> 20:59.993
better hurry up, Grandpa.

20:59.995 --> 21:02.162
Hey, let's make a deal.

21:02.164 --> 21:04.865
Next time you're in town,
assuming you haven't

21:04.867 --> 21:06.066
found anyone

21:06.068 --> 21:07.284
and I haven't found anyone,

21:07.286 --> 21:09.236
what do you say
that you and I...

21:09.238 --> 21:10.570
Ew.

21:12.029 --> 21:14.113
I was gonna say
help each other find someone!
