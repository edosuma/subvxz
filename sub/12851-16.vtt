Riley, do what
your mother wants.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.047

the age

03:12.126 --> 03:14.059

03:14.061 --> 03:16.295
-She called you?
-She didn't have to!

03:16.297 --> 03:18.564

as the sky turned black!

03:20.568 --> 03:22.968

let this happen?

Riley, apologize to your mother

Yeah. The finale's probably
not even gonna be any good.

You can't win this.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.365
What is the matter
with everybody?

03:53.367 --> 03:55.934
This is normal,
healthy teenage rebellion.
This is supposed to happen.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.103
I'm right on schedule.
How could this go wrong?

03:58.105 --> 03:59.504
Educate her, Hambone.

04:00.774 --> 04:04.409
Chapter One:
Crushing defeats.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.411
Godzilla... versus Japan.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.846
Japan loses, Riley.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.381
Really loses.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.550
-Tell her how bad they lose.
-They lose so bad their voices

04:11.552 --> 04:13.619
come out of their mouths
three seconds later.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.555
How does that compare
to what's going on here?

04:16.557 --> 04:19.458
Because what's going on here
is Godzilla versus Riley.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.059
You're Riley.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.262
I'm a teenager.
I'm in high school,
I have rights,

04:23.264 --> 04:24.763
and it's time
that I said so.

04:26.634 --> 04:30.969
I'm Riley. I'm a walnut.
I'm in high school.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.605
I have rights, and it's time
that I said so.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.440
And now there's this.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.546
Mommy is not a hammer.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.415
I know what I married.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.385
So you just happened
to have a hammer in your desk.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.654
Oh, yeah. That's a new thing
that's gonna happen now.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.889
Whatever I need
is gonna be right here
in this desk.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.600
This isn't just Godzilla
versus Riley.

05:01.602 --> 05:04.770
This is Godzilla versus Riley
and her faithful sidekick Maya.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.104
Ring power!

05:06.106 --> 05:08.173
I don't do that.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.684
Thank you, come again.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.222
Thank you, come again.

05:27.328 --> 05:30.095
Thank you, come again.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.701
Gee, Mom, it must be tough
when your oldest child
lets you down,

05:35.703 --> 05:37.636
and you don't
have any other children

05:37.638 --> 05:40.772

Oh, wait, here's one now.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.175

05:43.177 --> 05:44.943

I'll tell you
what I'm sure of,
little Maya.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.178
There comes
a time in the life
of every young person

06:20.180 --> 06:22.581
where they stand up
and say, "I am me."

06:22.583 --> 06:25.684

<i>This show contains scenes</i>

06:38.232 --> 06:41.166
<i>and is also</i>
<i>Amber Tweddington's</i>
<i>final episode.</i>

06:43.537 --> 06:46.772
It's just TV, Maya.
You and I, we're real life.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.708
Okay, let's go with that.
How would the two be different
in this case?

06:49.710 --> 06:53.412
TV's all exaggerated,
it's all too big for no reason.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.520
But here in real life,
a mother's reaction

07:01.522 --> 07:04.122
to her teenage daughter
asserting a newfound sense
of maturity

07:04.124 --> 07:05.590
could only go good.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.794
(door squeaking open)

07:17.070 --> 07:18.804
We're on TV!

07:19.907 --> 07:21.606
Oh. Okay!

07:21.608 --> 07:23.708
You are now
just as much a part of this
as she is, accomplice.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.210
I told her she should be
with you.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.244
Half-heartedly?

07:26.246 --> 07:27.913
-Whole Maya Hartedly!
-Is this true?

07:27.915 --> 07:29.648
She said, "Are you sure
you should be doing this?"

07:29.650 --> 07:32.717
and I said, "Yes,"
because the time has come
where I should be able

07:32.719 --> 07:34.786
to make my own decisions.

07:34.788 --> 07:39.825
Uh-huh. And so you decided
to not show up at the bakery.
That was your first decision?

07:39.827 --> 07:42.327
Tonight's finale
is a very big deal
in the lives

07:42.329 --> 07:44.763
-of my generation.
-You could record the finale.

07:44.765 --> 07:45.797
Oh, we are!

07:48.068 --> 07:50.769
(cracks neck)
Maya, leave!

07:50.771 --> 07:52.471
Maya would never--

07:53.474 --> 07:55.841
Aw, you scared my friend away.

07:57.811 --> 08:02.113
(loudly)
I would like to, at this time,
thank you for all you do

08:02.115 --> 08:04.416
and give you this card
to lift your spirits,

08:04.418 --> 08:07.652
because you're
so disappointed in Riley.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.355
Okay, Auggie, thank you.

08:10.357 --> 08:15.927
The card has a dollar in it.
All you do is give, give, give

08:15.929 --> 08:18.864
to Riley,
and I've given you a dollar.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.165
Think about it.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.868
-Auggie?
-(normal voice)
Think about it.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.505
-Riley--
-Was I not a good child?

08:26.507 --> 08:28.540
-You were a very good child.
-Am I not a good person?

08:28.542 --> 08:30.375
-Get there.
-I believe I am entitled--

08:30.377 --> 08:32.611
Ooh, what was that
you just said?

08:32.613 --> 08:36.114
-What?
-That word that you just used.
What was it?

08:36.116 --> 08:38.283
I believe I am entitled...

08:38.285 --> 08:40.785
to be in charge
of my own life now.

08:40.787 --> 08:45.357
Uh-huh. And I believe
I am entitled to ground you
for two weeks,

08:45.359 --> 08:46.825
but I'm not going to do that.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.895
-Good.
-I'm going to ground you
for three weeks.

08:49.897 --> 08:54.633
You sat in the bay window
for three days. No computer,
no phone, no finale.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.868
You sit here,
and you think about

08:56.870 --> 08:58.570
how maybe you are
a good person now,

08:58.572 --> 09:00.372
but it's because
your parents raised you right.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.641
And we helped you
make all of the right decisions,

09:02.643 --> 09:04.376
except for this one!

09:04.378 --> 09:05.944
Raised you right!

09:10.083 --> 09:13.084
Because that's what ending
with the entitlement
you believe you're due.

09:13.086 --> 09:18.323
So, you sit. And you think.
And if you think correctly,
at the end of three weeks,

09:18.325 --> 09:20.191
I'll get an apology.

09:20.193 --> 09:24.896
Hey, you. Go home.
She's grounded.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.731
Maya:
Okay.

09:34.007 --> 09:38.443
Okay. I thought about it.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.588
You can do this?

10:05.939 --> 10:09.975
The greatest finale
in the history of television!

10:09.977 --> 10:11.476
And Farkle didn't even guess
what happened!

10:11.478 --> 10:13.945
And he didn't spoil it
for me, Lucas, or anybody!

10:13.947 --> 10:16.147
I brought s'mores!

10:16.149 --> 10:19.317
It was too good!
I could never spoil anything
that good!

10:19.319 --> 10:24.322
Both:
La, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la!

10:24.324 --> 10:28.059
Even I didn't guess that Blarg
was the human and everybody else
was the Martian!

10:28.061 --> 10:32.397
(both scream)

10:34.668 --> 10:37.168
-You didn't see it?
-How could you
have not seen it?

10:37.170 --> 10:38.803
You watched every episode
to prepare.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.071
I was grounded.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.840
You? But you're Riley.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.659
Godzilla took my laptop.

10:43.660 --> 10:45.477
-What about your phone?
-She took that, too,
Godzilla's crafty.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.779
-She took my phone, too.
-How could she take your phone?

10:47.781 --> 10:50.849
Godzilla knows no boundaries.
She's Godzilla.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.985
Okay... that's my wife
we're talkin' about.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.855
-So?
-So she might hear!

10:56.857 --> 11:00.258
-How could Blarg be
a human if he had two heads?
-And if his name was Blarg?

11:00.260 --> 11:02.027
And if he was green?

11:02.029 --> 11:03.695
He wasn't!
Everybody else was!

11:03.697 --> 11:06.865
It was the audience
who was mind wiped! Brilliant!

11:09.436 --> 11:12.504
We missed it. We missed
the greatest moment
of our lives.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.708
All right, she needs me,
time's up, back
where you belong.

11:20.113 --> 11:23.515
Sometimes the battle
just isn't worth fighting.

11:23.517 --> 11:27.452
A diplomatic solution
might be preferable
to the horrible cost of war.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.559
I would like to begin
with peace talks.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.461
Is this an apology?

11:36.463 --> 11:37.862
This is a diplomatic solution.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.432
May I sit at the table?

11:41.902 --> 11:44.869
Why don't we let her sit down
and see what she has to say?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.978
-Mother.
-Daughter.

11:53.980 --> 11:57.315
I understand that you wanted me
at the bakery because
it was important to you.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.485
You understand that
I wanted to do something else
that was important to me,

12:00.487 --> 12:02.153
even though you didn't see
the value in it.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.755
Bad road, Riley.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.724
You don't care
about what's important to me.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.659
You only care
about what's important to you.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.428
It's good
to see her again, huh?

12:10.430 --> 12:12.030
Yeah.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.065
Really bad
bumpy dirt road,

12:14.067 --> 12:15.834
Riley, with no lights
and a cliff,

12:15.836 --> 12:18.069
and some sort
of weird hitchhiker
with a banjo!

12:19.906 --> 12:21.573
Turn around now!

12:21.575 --> 12:24.042
You say I'm not entitled
to feel this way?

12:24.044 --> 12:26.344
The name of the bad road
is Entitlement Avenue,

12:26.346 --> 12:28.913
and right now,
you are on the corner
of Entitlement Avenue

12:28.915 --> 12:31.416
and All About Me Boulevard.

12:32.686 --> 12:34.018
Guess who's house is there?

12:37.624 --> 12:40.024
I've been a really good person
my whole life.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.427
If you ground me the one time
that I do something
that you don't like,

12:42.429 --> 12:45.997
where is my reward
for doing something good
on all the other days?

12:46.967 --> 12:48.133
Godzilla's house!

12:50.704 --> 12:53.605
And look! Godzilla's
come to say hello!

12:55.609 --> 12:58.943
You think you deserve a reward
for being a good person,

12:58.945 --> 13:01.880
that we should
celebrate your goodness.
Would you like a parade?

13:01.882 --> 13:05.950
-Ooh.
-I suspect that's a trap.

13:05.952 --> 13:10.155
No, it isn't.
I think she's knows
that she's being unreasonable.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.823
And I think
this is a very big moment

13:11.825 --> 13:13.158
for all of the kids
in the world.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.127
I don't wanna see you
right now.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.096
Dad?

13:18.098 --> 13:19.464
You heard your monster.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.001
Mother.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.172
Monster.

13:27.174 --> 13:32.110
-That is unfair.
-No! I'll tell you what this is,
this is disrespectful.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.912
I'll tell you what is fair.

13:33.914 --> 13:37.682
While you live under our roof,
when we ask you to do something,
you do it!

13:37.684 --> 13:39.484
-Do you understand?
-But I'm such a good person,

13:39.486 --> 13:41.152
how could something like this
be happening?

13:41.154 --> 13:43.988
I'm just as surprised
as you are!

13:43.990 --> 13:47.826
Don't be.
This is where we demonstrate
strength, confidence,

13:47.828 --> 13:49.360
and trust in her upbringing

13:49.362 --> 13:51.262
that will get her
to the right decision.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.667
Maybe it's time I didn't live
under this roof anymore.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.468
Oh, come on, Riley.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.204
You're a good kid!

13:59.206 --> 14:02.941
Parents pay for that with food,
clothing, love, and shelter.

14:02.943 --> 14:06.177
Did you forget about that?
You have no job, no money,

14:06.179 --> 14:08.213
and everything you own,
we gave you.

14:08.215 --> 14:12.684
Fine. You can have them back.
I have $17 in my pocket
and my boundless spirit.

14:14.154 --> 14:18.122
Okay, honey.
This is the move
you wanna play now?

14:18.124 --> 14:21.693
You're about to find out
that your spirit has bounds.

14:23.129 --> 14:25.630
That's just great, Riley,
you just drove off a cliff.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.966
What kind of rat hole
at the bottom of a cliff,

14:27.968 --> 14:30.568
are you gonna find for $17?

14:34.674 --> 14:35.940
(knock on door)

14:39.212 --> 14:41.613
Hi, honey, I'm home.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.190
-What happened?
-We're roommates!

14:52.192 --> 14:55.426
Like we always wanted, yay!

14:55.428 --> 14:58.229
This is the happiest day
of my life.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.765
-You are me forever.
-Doin' what we want.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.234
-Whatever we want.
-Whenever we wanna do it.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.869
What's the first thing
you wanna do?

15:04.871 --> 15:08.106
Go home and be loved,
but my parents
don't love me anymore.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.407
They love you forever.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.277
They took everything, Maya.
I have nothing.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.213
All I have
is my bunny nightlight,
Horatio P. Hare.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.214
What's the "P" stand for?

15:16.216 --> 15:17.882
Rabbit.

15:17.884 --> 15:21.419
-Riley.
-Call me poor little Riley.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.188
-Poor little Riley.
-I need to prepare myself
for my new life.

15:24.190 --> 15:28.893
I need to read<i> Oliver Twist,</i>
get gloves with no fingers,
and see<i> Annie.</i>

15:28.895 --> 15:30.528
Yeah, and if this
is your only outfit,

15:30.530 --> 15:33.998
then what did you plan
on wearing to school tomorrow
and for the rest of your life?

15:35.235 --> 15:39.270
Well... I was hopeful
that you would lend me
one of your old outfits

15:39.272 --> 15:43.074
just until I got myself
on my feet, and...
began my job search.

15:43.076 --> 15:46.544
Just give me any old thing
that you're not using anymore.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.648
How do I look?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.250
Desperate.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.485
Okay, so what job
are you gonna interview
for first?

15:54.487 --> 15:56.888
-Editor of<i> Vogue?</i>
-That's your first job
out of school?

15:56.890 --> 15:58.990
-I believe I'm qualified.
-What's on your resume?

15:58.992 --> 16:00.792
-Editor of<i> Vogue?</i>
-Then welcome to<i> Vogue!</i>

16:00.794 --> 16:02.126
Oh, really, I got it?

16:02.128 --> 16:03.594
What are you gonna do first?

16:03.596 --> 16:05.296
Call my mom and tell her,

16:05.298 --> 16:07.799
because I want her
to be so proud of me.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.901
Oh, honey.

16:09.903 --> 16:11.135
Let it out.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.137
I want to go home, Maya.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.739
I hurt my mom.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.975
But I can't go home.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.176
Why not?

16:18.178 --> 16:20.745
Because I don't want her
to win.

16:20.747 --> 16:24.749
Riley, your mother
is the strongest,
smartest woman I know.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.250
This isn't gonna break her.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.219
Nothing can break her.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.157
I'm dying.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.860
-You're not dying.
-Mommy's dying?

16:35.862 --> 16:37.328
She's not dying.

16:37.330 --> 16:41.132
Riley is my entire reason
for being.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.267
Well, you still have me.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.936
No!

16:46.172 --> 16:47.839
Am I not enough for you?

16:47.841 --> 16:49.841
No...

16:49.843 --> 16:51.576
That's honest.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.713
Okay, I just need
to stop thinking about this.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.181
I'm just gonna go to sleep.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.316
Where do I sleep, please?

16:58.318 --> 17:00.184
Oh, we can sleep
in my bunk beds.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.652
Ooh,
you have bunk beds? Where?

17:01.654 --> 17:03.888
You get the lower!

17:07.794 --> 17:10.094
The lower is taken.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.668
I surrender. I apologize.
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.303
I love you. I'm an idiot.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.306
I accept your apology.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.377
But I agree
with the idiot thing.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.146
Where's Mom?

17:30.383 --> 17:31.582
(knocks)

17:31.584 --> 17:34.419
I surrender.
You are a good person,

17:34.421 --> 17:37.021
and you're the best daughter
anyone could have.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.356
Thanks, not my ma.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.558
Not you. Where's Riley?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.226
She went to apologize to you.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.495
She's been crying all night.
She felt horrible.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.832
I would've called to tell you,
but, oh, hey, I can't.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.834
Oh. Yeah, okay.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.249
-Mother.
-Daughter.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.418
-Father.
-Son.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.587
We wanna play, too.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.622
Perhaps there is something
you would like to say to me?

18:11.624 --> 18:12.957
No, please, you first.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.259
-After you.
-I couldn't possibly.
After you.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.696
-Riley?
-Okay, maybe I'm not really
entitled to anything...

18:18.698 --> 18:21.299
but I know
that I would never want
to hurt you.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.768
-Mom?
-When something's
important to you,

18:23.770 --> 18:25.570
I should really respect
your feelings.

18:25.572 --> 18:28.439
I should never have
let it get to this point,
even though you were wrong.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.708
That doesn't matter.
Yes, it does.

18:32.412 --> 18:36.414
Riley, do you know
the difference between Martians
and human beings?

18:36.416 --> 18:40.251
The thing human beings
are entitled to is to make
a wrong decision

18:40.253 --> 18:41.986
every once in a while.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.891
And I hope
that being wrong or right
doesn't matter as much

18:46.893 --> 18:49.227
as remembering
how much we mean
to each other.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.963
-I love you, Riley.
-I love you, too.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.400
Am I still grounded?

18:56.402 --> 18:58.469
You are so grounded.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.038
Okay.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.510
Thank you for everything.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.251
I'm still your favorite,
right, Dad?

19:14.320 --> 19:15.319
Whatever you need, son.

19:16.623 --> 19:19.023
-Can I be grounded?
-Ah, sure, why not?

19:19.025 --> 19:20.725
Yay...!

19:25.098 --> 19:29.000
Well... we got outta
that one, huh?

19:30.036 --> 19:31.669
Godzilla?

19:31.671 --> 19:34.338
You know you're Godzilla.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.873
Yeah.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.513
(knock on door)

19:42.515 --> 19:44.615
You okay?

19:44.617 --> 19:49.220
I am alone, I am forgotten.
Nobody cares about you
when you're grounded.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.488
The time
is gonna pass quickly.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.290
You're serving your sentence
with honor.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.758
Thank you, Mom.

19:57.397 --> 20:01.999
♪ Out here in space
I kiss your green face ♪

20:02.001 --> 20:06.337
