I just built my place around it.

05:09.291 --> 05:13.458
You lowlife excuse for a pilot.

05:13.542 --> 05:17.417
When you said Molly had eaten your maps,
that was cute.

05:17.500 --> 05:22.041
When you said a big hurricane
blew your plane to Louie's,

05:22.125 --> 05:23.917
that was mildly amusing.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.792
But this is stupid!

05:26.875 --> 05:30.875
But, Becky, we really saw a ghost.

05:41.709 --> 05:46.583
Yeah, running for our lives,
I sorta left the cargo at Louie's.

05:46.709 --> 05:50.834
-Then just go back and get it.
-Back there? No way!

05:50.917 --> 05:57.000
-That hash house is haunted.
-C-c-come see for yourself.

05:57.083 --> 06:01.709
Yeah, and if there's no ghost,
I'll quit my job.

06:01.792 --> 06:06.166

you won't have a job to quit.

There's the proof.

-Ah-ha! Ghost, huh?
-I've been framed.

07:06.667 --> 07:10.625
Possession is 9/10ths of guilt.
Let's go, Baloo.

07:10.709 --> 07:15.375
Oh, but who's gonna help me
get rid of that kooky spook?

07:15.458 --> 07:18.041

Are these ruffians
presenting a problem?

07:51.000 --> 07:55.917
Uh, no.
I think the situation's under control.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.041

-The pleasure is mine, madam.

08:04.291 --> 08:08.083
Well, now, who's the stiff?

08:08.166 --> 08:10.875
You don't see many
of them around here, Baloo.

08:10.959 --> 08:15.542
-They're called gentlemen.
-No, they're called customers.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.083
You don't see many of them around either.

Welcome to Louie's, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

08:21.291 --> 08:24.375
Let me show you
the best table in the house.

08:24.458 --> 08:29.291
I beg your pardon.
You call this an eating establishment?

08:29.375 --> 08:32.833
It looks to me like you've ruined
a perfectly good sailing ship.

08:33.332 --> 08:38.708
-Madam, if this were my ship, I'd--
-Have them flogged?

08:38.792 --> 08:42.750
[chuckles] Well said, madam.
Hang them from the yardarm.

08:42.833 --> 08:45.583
It'd take two yardarms for Baloo.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.917
I see what you mean.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.166
Why doesn't she take
a long walk off a short pier?

08:52.250 --> 08:55.500

08:55.583 --> 09:00.250
-You'll apologize to the lady, sir.
-Show me a lady, and I will.

Oh, I've lost all track of time.

Um, come on, Baloo, we have to get going.

09:26.750 --> 09:31.834
-Might I escort milady out?
-I thought you'd never ask.

09:31.917 --> 09:33.750
Must you leave?

09:33.834 --> 09:38.083
I wish I could stay,
but I've got a shipping company to run.

09:38.166 --> 09:41.417
[Stansbury] Indeed!
I am impressed!

09:41.500 --> 09:43.709
[chuckles]
Check it out, man.

09:43.792 --> 09:48.333
Old barnacle breath is putting
the whammy on Beckorammy.

09:49.542 --> 09:52.917
And old Baloo's
going to nip it in the bud.

09:53.959 --> 09:55.458
Hey, what gives?

09:55.542 --> 09:59.542
Uh-oh, it looks like
we're in for an encore.

It's the ghost!

A miracle of engineering.

you've never seen an airplane before.

10:14.875 --> 10:18.250
I've been a bit out of touch lately.

10:21.125 --> 10:25.875
Astonishing!
And this ship of the air is yours?

10:25.959 --> 10:28.375
Madam, you amaze me.

10:28.458 --> 10:32.250
Where I came from, women sew, and cook,
and take care of the little ones.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.000
There's that, too.

10:34.083 --> 10:38.750
But you, I've never met anyone like you.

10:39.667 --> 10:43.375
I was about to say
the same thing about you.

10:43.458 --> 10:44.875

10:54.083 --> 10:56.542

Excuse me, captain.

10:56.625 --> 10:59.250
Got to ring out my pilot
so we can head home.

10:59.333 --> 11:03.917
-Must you really leave?
-Yes, I have to get back.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.875

11:14.667 --> 11:16.875
Cargo or no, we got to go!

11:16.959 --> 11:20.125
I don't believe it.
Generator's out.

Batteries, hydraulics...
From the rudder to the fuzzy dice,

11:25.333 --> 11:30.291
this whole plane is dead.
We can't get out of here.

11:30.375 --> 11:34.041
It's like s-s-someone
wants us to s-s-stay.

11:34.125 --> 11:37.375

Don't give me that garbage again.

11:51.792 --> 11:53.375
What's going on here?

11:53.458 --> 11:57.083
It's like he just... disappeared.

12:03.333 --> 12:06.291
If you can't fix
this rust bucket till morning,

12:06.375 --> 12:08.875
at least I'm going to get some sleep.

You want us to sleep
in that haunted house?

12:12.083 --> 12:15.125

Well, you can't sleep in here.

-Have a little backbone.

-Yeah!

-I don't hear anything.
-That's what I mean.

14:00.166 --> 14:02.917
-We scared him off.
-You think so?

14:06.625 --> 14:08.667
[both whistling]

14:09.959 --> 14:11.625
[babbling]

14:11.709 --> 14:12.625
[blows raspberry]

14:12.709 --> 14:15.458
[laughs]
Success, my man!

14:15.542 --> 14:18.166
No ghost is going to
make us look stupid.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.083
[yells]

14:19.166 --> 14:20.000
[crashing]

14:20.083 --> 14:23.291
Yeah, we've got ourselves to do that.

14:23.375 --> 14:26.583
[Louie] Hey, hey, fuzzy!
Let me out, man!

14:26.667 --> 14:29.000
[grunts]
It's jammed.

14:29.875 --> 14:31.083
[Rebecca giggles]

14:31.166 --> 14:33.792
And did you see
the expression on their faces

14:33.875 --> 14:36.208
when you threatened
to hang them from the yardarm?

14:36.291 --> 14:38.625
[Stansbury laughs]
And when you suggested flogging?

14:38.709 --> 14:39.583
[both laughing]

14:39.667 --> 14:42.291
I don't know how you
put up with those scoundrels.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.709
Well, they're sort of my friends.

14:44.792 --> 14:49.917
Ah, my apologies.
Or my condolences.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.417
[laughs]
You've got that right.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.583
They wouldn't know a real gentleman
if one came up and...

14:55.667 --> 14:57.917
put a flower in my hair.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.792
Nor would they know a real lady...

15:00.875 --> 15:05.500
If one came up and kissed him.

15:05.583 --> 15:07.458
[laughing]

15:12.375 --> 15:13.542
[gasps]

15:13.625 --> 15:16.041
Oh, this must be a dream.

15:16.709 --> 15:20.125
If only I had a forevermore
to spend like this,

15:20.208 --> 15:22.709
and someone to share it with.

15:22.792 --> 15:27.208
Your dream could come true, milady...
if you wanted it to.

15:30.917 --> 15:33.291
Perhaps another time, milady.

15:34.041 --> 15:35.083
[grunting]

15:35.166 --> 15:38.208
Hey, what's the matter, my man?

15:38.291 --> 15:40.500
You look like you've seen a ghost.

15:40.583 --> 15:43.000
[shuddering]

15:43.083 --> 15:44.583
It's him!

15:44.667 --> 15:47.417
Him? Whom?
Where?

15:47.500 --> 15:51.000
Th-th-the ghost!
This ship was his.

15:51.083 --> 15:55.041
It crashed in a storm 100 years ago.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.083
It's in the dude's diary.

15:57.166 --> 16:01.208
[laughs]
How could you read a diary in the dark?

16:02.208 --> 16:03.917
That's how.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.750
Oh, no, Becky's boyfriend is a ghost!

16:08.417 --> 16:10.083
What are we gonna do, Baloo?

16:10.166 --> 16:14.166
We're going to come up with a plan
to catch... a ghost.

16:23.834 --> 16:25.041
Now!

16:25.125 --> 16:26.750
I got you!

16:26.834 --> 16:29.125
No! Rebecca!

16:29.208 --> 16:30.709
[rope tears]

16:33.583 --> 16:34.834
[both gasp]

16:38.041 --> 16:40.834
Go ahead, skewer me all you want.

16:40.917 --> 16:44.709
I am not letting any ghost take my boss.

16:44.792 --> 16:49.000
Yeah, skewer him all you want,
Captain Blight.

16:49.375 --> 16:53.875
-[Stansbury] I'm taking Rebecca with me.
-Oh, yeah, spooky?

16:53.959 --> 16:55.750
I'd like to see you try.

17:18.625 --> 17:20.916
[Baloo and Louie yelling]

17:33.250 --> 17:34.417
[sighs]

17:34.500 --> 17:37.959
Oh, what a marvelous dream.

17:38.041 --> 17:40.834
I told you your dreams could come true.

17:45.959 --> 17:49.625
-Look, milady.
-Make a wish?

17:50.583 --> 17:54.834
I wish for you to stay with me, Rebecca.

17:55.291 --> 17:59.166
The skies are ours to sail
anywhere your heart desires,

17:59.250 --> 18:01.458
for the rest of time.

18:01.542 --> 18:02.709
Oh...

18:05.583 --> 18:08.667
Now, wait a minute!
Hey!

18:09.750 --> 18:12.000
Rebecca!

18:12.083 --> 18:13.875
Yes, Baloo?

18:13.959 --> 18:20.834
I hate to bust up the party, Becky,
but your boyfriend here is a ghost!

18:20.917 --> 18:24.291
Well, sure,
anything's possible in a dream.

18:24.375 --> 18:27.041
-Isn't it?
-Of course.

18:30.375 --> 18:33.709
I got to bust free of this crazy KP.

18:36.792 --> 18:38.208
Nyah, nyah!

18:39.583 --> 18:40.667
Ow!

18:43.250 --> 18:45.250
Hey, pal, you OK?

18:47.166 --> 18:50.917
Oh, baby, I'm much more than OK.

18:53.083 --> 18:55.667
"Magic spells of the sea."

18:55.750 --> 18:58.333
Our ticket out of here.

18:58.458 --> 19:01.875
Now, let's see,
"Ghosts, mermaids, scurvy, squids..."

19:01.959 --> 19:06.208
Oh, here it is.
A spell to unwhammify ghost ships.

19:07.083 --> 19:09.750
Now we'll flush old flange-face.

19:09.834 --> 19:11.834
[suction sound]

19:13.875 --> 19:15.208
[clears throat]

19:17.500 --> 19:20.333
"Flounders and flying fish,
scrubba-de-dub,

19:20.417 --> 19:23.166
drop to the deck of this rotten, old tub."

19:24.792 --> 19:26.250
Thank you.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.834
Don't mention it, my good man.

19:32.458 --> 19:34.125
You're on, good buddy.

19:34.208 --> 19:39.000
Ahem. "Mermaids, and herrings,
and ancient boat slips,

19:39.083 --> 19:42.125
-take to the heavens."
-No, don't!

19:44.500 --> 19:45.750
What are you doing?

19:45.834 --> 19:49.041
-Getting rid of Count Casanova.
-And getting us home.

19:58.709 --> 20:00.625
Isn't it enough you guys ruin my life?

20:00.709 --> 20:02.834
Do you have to ruin my dreams, too?

20:02.917 --> 20:06.792
Becky, wake up,
this isn't a dream, it's real.

20:06.875 --> 20:09.291
Rebecca, this is real.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.625
Quick, finish the spell.

20:10.709 --> 20:14.792
-No, stay with me.
-You've got to come back with us.

20:14.875 --> 20:21.000
Stop, please! I want to stay.
I just want to be happy.

20:21.125 --> 20:26.041
Becky, I want you to be happy, too.
But you gotta think, honey.

20:26.125 --> 20:29.500
Think of your life.
Think of Molly.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.166
Molly...

20:35.500 --> 20:37.417
Oh, I can't stay.

20:37.834 --> 20:43.166
You've given me a dream forever,
but I... my daughter.

20:43.250 --> 20:47.542
-I have to go back.
-I... I understand, Rebecca.

20:50.500 --> 20:54.667
"Take to the heavens, illusionary ships,

20:54.750 --> 20:58.709
forever and always to sail the skies.

20:58.792 --> 21:03.667
Now part from this world
on wings to arise."

21:09.083 --> 21:12.083
Crazy!

21:17.208 --> 21:19.250
Rebecca, goodbye.

21:19.875 --> 21:22.625
[Rebecca] No, don't go.

21:22.709 --> 21:24.583
I'll wait for you, Rebecca.

21:26.709 --> 21:29.625
Perhaps... some day.

21:43.583 --> 21:44.667
[yawns]

21:44.750 --> 21:46.041
Mom?

21:47.375 --> 21:50.333
I missed you, Mommy.
Where were you?

21:50.417 --> 21:51.333
Mm...

21:51.417 --> 21:53.750
Mommy had a date with a ghost.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.750
[giggles] Sure, Mom.

21:56.834 --> 22:03.375
-Hey, who's that guy?
-Well, I'll tell you a story, Molly.

22:03.458 --> 22:07.291
A long time ago, there was a sea captain.

22:07.750 --> 22:12.250
He was very brave,
and very, very handsome.

22:12.959 --> 22:18.208
