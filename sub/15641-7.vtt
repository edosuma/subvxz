WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.636
<i>Previously on Hit the Floor.</i>

00:04.086 --> 00:07.136
The backup generator's gonna take
hours before it's up and running.

00:07.299 --> 00:09.927
You've got till 8:30
to get it going for a 9:00 game.

00:10.093 --> 00:12.221
I see you for who you really are.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.389
Admit it. Admit that you want me.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.809
Your head is so far up your...

00:17.809 --> 00:20.107
- Everything okay in there?
- Yeah, everything's cool.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.613
Lipstick.

00:21.772 --> 00:24.946
Having you back
is having an effect on me.

00:26.360 --> 00:31.366
- What's your endgame?
-$757,432.86.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.626
- What does that buy?
- Freedom.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.836
Who's there? Mia.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.213
I need something
and you are gonna get it for me.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.374
- What's that?
- My uniform.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.444
I thought we were going to stop this?

01:06.358 --> 01:08.986
You said we were gonna stop this.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.921
I say a lot of things.

01:33.302 --> 01:38.399
- I have a meeting in an hour.
- I got practice in an hour.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.988
Let's make this fast.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.926
I have to go on the road.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.133
- When do you get back?
- Next week.

02:11.548 --> 02:16.054
Okay. Great. See you then.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.076
The producers of this movie
could have asked any dance team

02:31.234 --> 02:36.081
to the opening of this premiere.
It's quite an honour to ask us.

02:36.239 --> 02:40.369
Quite a no-brainer, considering Derek
and Terrence have cameos in it.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.163
Not everyone is as smart as you are,
Jelena.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.380
Tom Ford is at the house
fitting Chase for his suit.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.720
Is Terrence getting fitted?

02:49.878 --> 02:54.679
Yes, but he's not into
American designers. Too common.

02:56.134 --> 02:59.934
He's flying in his Italian designer
to fit him on his jet.

03:01.223 --> 03:04.397
I remember the days
when Chase and I had new money.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.937
Nothing was too pointless
to throw it at.

03:07.062 --> 03:10.908
Speaking of, I haven't seen you
and Terrence together much.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.073
It's gonna be nice to finally spend
some quality time together.

03:14.236 --> 03:18.366
He flew me to our villa in the Bahamas
last month. That was time enough.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.081
Do you and Chase
still have your condo in Vegas?

03:21.243 --> 03:24.668
We use it as an office for Chase's
international business clients.

03:24.830 --> 03:28.960
These days, players need to do
more than just play basketball.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.345
Particularly
when they don't play anymore.

03:32.462 --> 03:36.092
Starting businesses is
Terrence's favourite thing to do.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.976
Almost.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.308
You know this basketball life.

03:42.389 --> 03:46.895
Holding down the front while he's away.
That's the job of the wife.

03:48.186 --> 03:52.612
Or, you know, the girlfriend.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.154
So, what do we think people?

03:59.740 --> 04:03.586
Mauve.
Such a great colour in the '80s.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.968
Which one? I can't decide.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.755
Mini or floor length?

04:14.921 --> 04:19.176
Well, when I think of you,
I just think less.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.994
How's my sexy gym teacher?

04:42.157 --> 04:46.253
Overworked, underpaid,
but it was a good day.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.541
What's this perfume that you're wearing?

04:51.625 --> 04:53.753
Let's get a bigger place.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.968
We have two incomes now.
We deserve something amazing.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.267
- Why, all of a sudden?
- I don't know.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.684
Maybe because the shower sounds like
an old woman moaning?

05:04.846 --> 05:09.443
Or maybe because we can figure-skate on
the grease pool that is our parking spot?

05:09.601 --> 05:14.732
Or maybe I just want more space
to seduce my boyfriend?

05:16.983 --> 05:20.829
Well, I will make some appointments
to see some places for tomorrow.

05:20.946 --> 05:26.419
Places with lots of space
for your carnival of seduction.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.204
How about we check out some places
during the day,

05:29.371 --> 05:32.966
then have a nice dinner at night?
Make a whole date out of it.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.968
I don't know what's gotten into you,
but I like.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.589
- Can I get some now?
- No.

05:39.756 --> 05:43.806
There is a soul train Afro under here
and I have to get ready for practice.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.740
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

05:59.234 --> 06:01.612
Actually, the team jet is waiting,

06:01.778 --> 06:07.456
I just... I came in to see, or ask you
if you've seen, that. Thank you.

06:07.617 --> 06:11.713
You're a lifesaver. I would
not know what to do without this thing.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.670
We kissed.

06:15.292 --> 06:19.263
- In a supply closet.
- During a blackout.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.094
You're Ahsha's father.
Ahsha and I are friends.

06:25.260 --> 06:28.480
I like being your friend too.
I'd like to keep it that way.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.314
Me, too.

06:37.564 --> 06:44.288
And when I get back,
I would love to buy a friend a drink.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.659
- You're on.
- All right.

06:51.328 --> 06:55.128
So what? Are you just gonna let me
stand here and die of thirst?

06:55.290 --> 06:59.761
If it was only that easy.
What do you want, Jesse?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.799
The time of Miguel's Peewee
soccer game this weekend.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.432
What?

07:04.591 --> 07:07.561
You heard me. My son has a game.
I want to know what time it is.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.938
Since when do you go
to Miguel's games?

07:10.096 --> 07:12.975
I admit I've been a little lax
in the Daddy department.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.443
You're a little lax
in a lot of departments.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.781
I'm turning over a new leaf.
Miguel's my priority now.

07:25.403 --> 07:30.500
- Saturday at noon.
- Thanks. See you there.

07:34.621 --> 07:39.468
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, four, five, six.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.006
All right, flawless finish, let's see it.

07:49.469 --> 07:55.272
Ahsha, you missed your mark again.
I want you here, not there.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.561
All right, you guys,
let's do the final eight count.

07:57.727 --> 08:01.277
Make it hot, please. Thank you.
Five, six, seven, eight.

08:08.780 --> 08:13.251
Ahsha, are you blind?
Here, here, here.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.084
I'm doing my best.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.793
Wow, that was brave.

08:20.959 --> 08:25.214
Admitting that you can't do any better.
Thank you for your honesty.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.176
All right, take five
and thank this one

08:29.300 --> 08:31.974
for the 1O times you'll all have
to do this again.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.152
If Jelena's riding you extra hard today,
it's for a reason.

08:39.309 --> 08:44.157
- She's a raging bitch?
- Besides that.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.409
The numbers came in
for the calendar shoot.

08:46.568 --> 08:50.163
DVD, the calendar, they're huge.

08:51.156 --> 08:54.877
People are talking,
but not about her, about you.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.838
They're asking,
"Who's this new girl, Ahsha Hayes?"

08:58.997 --> 09:02.592
- Wow, really?
- Yes. Really.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.427
You know, I was thinking...

09:07.589 --> 09:10.934
I was thinking of sending a DVD
of the shoot to your mom.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.892
- Would she sign for that?
- Meaning what?

09:16.139 --> 09:18.562
I mean, if it's coming from you.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.195
She'd be too angry to sign for it?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

09:22.353 --> 09:24.981
No, I wasn't trying to say anything.

09:26.483 --> 09:30.283
What happened between your mother
and me is between your mother and me.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.619
I'm your boss.
Does any of that confuse you?

09:33.740 --> 09:38.120
No.
Maybe I should mind my own business.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.456
Maybe you should.

09:48.463 --> 09:52.093
- Do I still have my ass?
- Jelena is on you.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.260
- I meant Olivia.
- Well, don't worry.

09:54.385 --> 09:57.229
German will kiss it
and make it all better.

09:57.388 --> 10:00.062
You know, your boyfriend isn't nearly
the freak show I thought he'd be.

10:00.183 --> 10:05.280
He liked you, too.
He told me about the $752,452

10:05.438 --> 10:07.816
and something cents
you're trying to raise.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.615
Good luck getting that with our salary,
Boo-Boo.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.871
I have a few tricks in me.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.329
Shut up. Derek Roman?

10:21.496 --> 10:25.126
He didn't just miss one game.
He didn't even get on the plane, okay?

10:25.291 --> 10:29.091
Caught some sudden bug.
So sudden people are like, "Oh, hell no."

10:29.254 --> 10:31.097
Maybe he's really sick.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.559
Players can drunk drive through
an orphanage,

10:34.717 --> 10:36.890
but you miss a game, that's bad.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.285
- Mia!
- Raquel.

10:59.450 --> 11:05.048
- Where have you been?
- Where haven't I been?

11:05.206 --> 11:09.962
I've had tons of opportunities.
It's been amazing. Life's good.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.722
You don't look like life is good.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.600
I tried calling you
and your phone has been disconnected

11:15.758 --> 11:18.728
and now you're creeping around here
at this hour?

11:20.305 --> 11:23.149
What kind of trouble are you in?

11:23.308 --> 11:26.061
What? No. No, I just...

11:26.186 --> 11:29.156
I came by to see the gang, say hi.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.909
Does this have anything to do
with that married man you were seeing?

11:33.902 --> 11:37.748
You were always leaving to meet up
with him, later and later, more and more.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.668
Mia,
we used to tell each other everything.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.716
Sorry for being dumb.
Obviously no one's here.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.469
I'll just... I'll come back.

11:55.173 --> 11:58.973
You know, the dumbest thing I did

11:59.135 --> 12:02.264
was not taking advantage of the friend
that I had in you.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.672
<i>- I'll</i> be done in a sec.
- Take your time.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.261
You look glowy.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.980
Glowy? Or sweaty?

12:45.515 --> 12:49.941
There's something different about you.
It's like your curls aren't as tight.

12:50.061 --> 12:53.361
It's yoga. It relaxes me.

12:54.899 --> 13:00.906
Or maybe, I just love seeing you
happy doing what you love.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.294
What's with the face?

13:08.413 --> 13:11.633
Being a Devil Girl and being
German's girl are getting tough.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.674
I thought you two were good?

13:14.836 --> 13:18.010
We were. We are.

13:18.172 --> 13:21.301
But then I... It's nothing.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.220
I have an amazing boyfriend who's
taking me apartment hunting today.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.848
- I'm happy.
- Apartment hunting?

13:28.975 --> 13:32.650
Ahsha, every relationship
goes through transitions.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.280
The difference with you and German

13:34.439 --> 13:37.283
-is you've never been through one.
- True.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.787
You're living in two different worlds,
trying to balance your relationship.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.873
It's a test. It'll work out.

13:46.576 --> 13:50.331
- Trust each other.
- Mom, your phone.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.554
Answer it.

13:59.589 --> 14:05.016
It can wait. I'm busy,
being glowy with you.

14:09.682 --> 14:13.482
<i>Yeah? You've been naughty.</i>

14:13.644 --> 14:16.614
<i>But now I'm giving you a spanking.</i>

14:16.773 --> 14:19.697
Girl, I knew you could tie a knot
in a cherry stem,

14:19.859 --> 14:22.487
but how did you tie a knot into that.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.742
- Wow, Akon.
- Oh, my God, is that Akon?

14:27.909 --> 14:31.630
<i>Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes!</i>

14:31.746 --> 14:34.716
- Did that hurt?
- Ak0n!

14:34.874 --> 14:37.798
Oh, damn!
What'd he do to deserve that?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.759
Kyle, outside now!

14:46.636 --> 14:50.766
I warned you on day one, anything TMZ
or TMZ-adjacent and you out this tape.

14:50.932 --> 14:54.152
It's all over TMZ, Media Take Out,
Perez Hilton, should I keep going?

14:54.310 --> 14:58.190
I swear on a stack of Gideon bibles,
Olivia, I don't know how it got out.

14:58.356 --> 15:01.485
Most people leak them, Kyle.
It's called publicity.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.324
Is that what you think?

15:03.486 --> 15:06.911
That Akon leaked it
to sell his new album?

15:07.073 --> 15:09.451
That's whack.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.994
You're fired.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.960
Pack your bags, clean out your locker,
give Akon my best.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.465
It wasn't a bug Derek had,
it was a breakdown.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.380
- Says who?
- Me, to you, right now.

15:22.505 --> 15:25.258
Dude's a hot, funky mess.
Okay, his mom, piece of work.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.760
He doesn't even know his dad.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.224
Okay. Has anybody gone
to check on Derek?

15:29.387 --> 15:30.980
Everyone's away.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.642
You're here
and you seem really interested.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.880
Hi. Has anybody seen Derek?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.424
The guy who lives here?

16:02.545 --> 16:05.219
The guy who owns this house?
Derek Roman?

16:18.394 --> 16:22.274
Yeah, he's sick, Oscar. He's been
puking up red, white and blue.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.035
Yeah, doc says he should be
cleared for the next game.

16:26.194 --> 16:28.993
Yes, I can get you a doctor's note.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.543
Derek, what's going on?

16:40.249 --> 16:44.504
- You should go.
- What?

16:46.547 --> 16:49.221
Just leave, like everybody else.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.284
Was the kiss that good?

17:11.446 --> 17:15.372
I'm not here because of the kiss.
I'm here because I'm a human being.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.537
- Where'd everybody else go?
- Home.

17:17.662 --> 17:21.132
Or on the set of a rap video
where they belong.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.088
What's going on with you?

17:23.251 --> 17:26.425
You guys were locked away in that room
like I don't know what.

17:26.546 --> 17:30.676
- Trade talk.
- What? Are you leaving LA?

17:30.841 --> 17:34.015
Not me. Terrence, maybe.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.647
We were going over options
for who could replace him.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.900
Russell Westbrook, Rondo,
Tony Parker, or--

17:39.058 --> 17:43.905
This is huge. What would
the Devils be without Terrence?

17:44.021 --> 17:47.867
I mean, you and Terrence.
You guys are the team.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.285
He got tired of my crap.

17:55.700 --> 17:59.625
Said he wanted to try and go win
a championship someplace else.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.505
And all new teammates.

18:03.791 --> 18:08.797
I mean, it wouldn't be the first time
I screwed up and it won't be the last.

18:08.963 --> 18:11.807
Or you could look at this differently.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.970
It's all on you now. Sink or swim.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.934
And so what?

18:17.096 --> 18:21.567
No parties, hooch, elevators?

18:23.394 --> 18:26.568
Everybody knows Derek Roman
can give a good time,

18:26.731 --> 18:29.450
but not everybody knows
if he can get his act together

18:29.609 --> 18:31.953
and prove he's not just a screw up.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.262
- Hello?
- We won.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.228
Congratulations.

19:01.390 --> 19:05.270
That's 12 in a row.
You're a good luck charm.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.438
You don't need me for luck, Pete.

19:07.605 --> 19:11.735
You're a hard worker
and you've got a great team.

19:11.901 --> 19:15.997
Yeah, well, I couldn't resist calling you
from the road.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.748
It reminds me of the old days

19:17.907 --> 19:22.378
when I used to run around the arena
looking for a pay phone to call you from.

19:23.371 --> 19:27.342
- A pay phone. Really?
- Yeah.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.595
Well, go celebrate.

19:37.051 --> 19:41.807
- All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.255
Olivia, got a minute?

20:06.414 --> 20:08.633
Oh, God,
I thought you'd be gone hours ago.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.589
I was looking through the annals
of the Devil's bylaws

20:10.751 --> 20:13.345
of proper code and conduct
and in ordinance 03568,

20:13.462 --> 20:15.840
it says that a Devil Girl,
that would be me,

20:16.006 --> 20:19.260
released for a violation
by the director, that would be you,

20:19.427 --> 20:22.601
is entitled to an appeal
before a three-person panel.

20:24.181 --> 20:28.311
Nice try. The board is for important
executive matters, Kyle,

20:28.477 --> 20:31.777
not leaked sex tapes that shame
and defame the organisation.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.656
Rules are rules
and that's not what it says here.

20:36.819 --> 20:40.915
- Do you want to read it?
- Fine.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.666
I'll go ahead, I'll try to get
everyone's schedule together.

20:42.783 --> 20:46.413
But you know what, gosh,
it could take a long time to do that.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.332
Thursday at 9:00 a.m.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.500
I knew you were busy
so I called ahead.

21:03.971 --> 21:07.771
Excuse me, that's my locker.
Can I help you with something?

21:30.039 --> 21:32.133
Oh, my gosh.

22:01.445 --> 22:03.994
- Raquel.
- Jelena.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.158
Looks like there's a person in there.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.499
Is that what you're wearing
to the premiere?

22:09.620 --> 22:10.963
Haven't decided yet.

22:11.121 --> 22:14.921
Oh, I get it.
Got to check with your man first?

22:15.084 --> 22:18.679
- Terrence isn't coming.
-Isn't he in the movie?

22:18.838 --> 22:21.682
Let's just say I could be happier
with him right now.

22:21.841 --> 22:25.846
Speak of the devil.
Now, that's how you say sorry.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.857
- Raquel Saldana?
- That's me. Thank you.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.023
Who could these be from?

22:34.228 --> 22:36.902
"To new beginnings".

22:55.666 --> 22:58.670
I'm sorry I missed dinner
and the appointments.

22:58.836 --> 23:01.680
It was just work.

23:11.640 --> 23:15.065
I was at Derek's house.
He missed a game.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.901
He was in a bad place and there was
no one to check up on him.

23:18.022 --> 23:21.492
I should have called you,
but I was afraid of what you might say.

23:22.735 --> 23:26.831
I haven't been completely honest with
you and I want us to trust each other.

23:26.989 --> 23:30.914
Or for you to trust me,
so that's why I'm telling you.

23:35.998 --> 23:39.593
You didn't turn your back on someone
who was in trouble.

23:41.587 --> 23:45.683
-It's okay.
- You're okay?

23:45.841 --> 23:50.688
I'm okay. I'm gonna hit the gym.

23:50.846 --> 23:55.693
-It's really okay?
-It's okay.

24:22.878 --> 24:26.348
Hi, beginner's classes are Mondays
and Thursdays at eight.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.719
Oh, well, I'm not exactly a beginner.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.144
There's an advanced class starting
right now.

24:34.264 --> 24:38.235
You could hang out in the back,
when you're ready, shimmy into line.

24:39.228 --> 24:45.452
Oh, well, I don't have any dance clothes
with me or anything so--

24:45.609 --> 24:48.783
You're in luck.
I think I have your size.

25:02.251 --> 25:06.051
I thought we were making love.
I didn't even know the camera was on.

25:06.213 --> 25:09.843
My grandchildren are going
to see this.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.933
I hired a lawyer
and had it all taken down.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.723
But the damage is done.

25:15.889 --> 25:19.063
Oh, I'm ruined.

25:19.226 --> 25:23.197
All I ask is that you don't punish
the victim.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.488
We do feel for you, Miss Hart,

25:26.650 --> 25:29.403
but we have the reputation
of the organisation to think about.

25:29.570 --> 25:34.041
I understand.
Reputation is everything.

25:34.199 --> 25:38.670
I mean, I couldn't even imagine
how humiliating it would be,

25:38.829 --> 25:42.049
if, say, people found out that Victor
was arrested once

25:42.207 --> 25:44.209
for forging prescriptions.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.175
Or that Susan here slept
with Don in accounting

25:47.337 --> 25:50.511
when his wife was in the hospital
having gallbladder surgery.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.893
And, Frank,
that you settled out of court

25:53.052 --> 25:55.020
when they seized your laptop
for all of those--

25:55.179 --> 25:59.275
However, I say there is no reason not
to show some compassion this one time.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.776
And let this fine young lady back
on the team.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.300
What are you doing here?

26:25.459 --> 26:29.509
- I wanted to see if you got my flowers.
- Those were from you?

26:30.506 --> 26:33.555
- I can't do anything nice?
- No.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.266
To new beginnings.
It's not just about Miguel.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.396
I want to make things right between us.

26:38.555 --> 26:41.604
- Are you dying?
- Would that sweeten the deal?

26:41.767 --> 26:44.816
At least I've have some use
for the flowers now.

26:47.064 --> 26:49.442
Did you think the flowers
were from Pete?

26:51.485 --> 26:56.742
There we go. You think there's something
going on between me and Pete.

26:56.907 --> 27:00.377
Well, your lawyer is his wife's lawyer
and he does come in here quite a bit.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.755
You're doing what you always do.
You don't want me,

27:02.913 --> 27:06.383
but you don't want anyone else
to have me. You want to control me.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.174
I can't have you screwing the coach.
It's not good for business.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.885
This is none of your business.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.095
If you have another man around my kid,
then--

27:14.258 --> 27:18.388
Then he might see
what a real one looks like.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.317
I won't forget you said that.

27:30.232 --> 27:33.702
<i>Wow, Akon. Oh, yeah.</i>

27:33.861 --> 27:35.659
This tape's been taken down.

27:35.821 --> 27:39.246
And yet, there it is.
Make me an offer.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.627
I can't post it without being sued
by the Devils.

27:41.743 --> 27:47.295
I'll take it off your hands for ten grand
for my own personal collection.

27:47.457 --> 27:51.052
Nice try. I know you have underground
pay sites all over the world.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.839
You move tapes faster
than legal can track them.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.758
I'm a researcher.

27:55.924 --> 27:59.804
- Okay, 15 grand, three instalments.
- Honey, I'm on a time crunch.

27:59.970 --> 28:03.065
I've got a dance to get to,
so let's speed this thing up.

28:03.182 --> 28:07.437
8O Gs, 10% of the gross
and make the full cheque out to cash.

28:08.812 --> 28:12.487
Unless you don't think that I can get
a better offer somewhere else.

28:13.942 --> 28:19.415
Well, you know, you're almost as
good in business as you are in bed.

28:22.451 --> 28:23.998
Almost.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.133
<i>Wow, Akon.</i>

28:38.300 --> 28:43.773
No, Chase, it's fine. They're sending me
and Pete to the premiere in a limo so...

28:44.765 --> 28:46.358
Okay, bye.

28:49.686 --> 28:54.157
Have you talked to Sloane?
She's completely shut me out.

28:54.316 --> 28:58.742
I was just wondering
if you've been forgiven.

28:58.862 --> 29:01.661
No, I haven't talked to her.

29:03.867 --> 29:09.044
She's so stubborn.
Always has been.

29:10.332 --> 29:13.757
I mean, she refused to hear my side.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.047
Well, what other side is there?

29:16.213 --> 29:18.386
You got with her boyfriend
for some shine.

29:18.548 --> 29:20.892
-It's pretty cut and dry.
- I what?

29:22.177 --> 29:25.772
We're both adults now, Olivia.
You can admit it.

29:27.057 --> 29:32.109
I was wasted and you got with me
long enough to get a little bit famous.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.525
As soon as you got what you needed,
you traded up to Chase.

29:35.691 --> 29:39.696
Don't you dare act like
I had to drag you into bed.

29:39.820 --> 29:43.290
If anyone knew what you were doing,
Pete, it was you.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.076
You, you were cheating
on Sloane with me

29:46.243 --> 29:50.123
while you were cheating on me
with anything that moved.

29:50.289 --> 29:53.259
And I got with Chase
not because he was the better deal.

29:53.417 --> 29:56.261
I got with him
because he was the better man.

29:57.379 --> 30:03.386
You're right.
I was not at my best back then.

30:06.596 --> 30:10.817
I'm trying to be better.

30:14.563 --> 30:17.112
Well, we're here.

30:20.694 --> 30:25.871
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. I'll see you later.

30:26.033 --> 30:29.458
- You're not coming to the premiere?
- I've got something else to do.

30:30.912 --> 30:34.337
Okay. Fine, Pete.

30:55.437 --> 30:59.567
Babe, you look like
you'd rather be getting a root canal.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.452
The spotlight is your thing, not mine.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.824
Stop worrying about me, all right?
Go ahead and have a good time.

31:06.990 --> 31:11.245
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are
excited to kick off our premiere</i>

31:11.411 --> 31:15.006
<i>with LA's own Devil Girls!</i>

31:18.710 --> 31:20.712
- Did I miss anything?
- Get in line

31:20.879 --> 31:22.881
before I find a way
to fire you again.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.265
If anyone asks, cover for me.

33:29.382 --> 33:33.228
- You're not staying?
- The Devil's work is never done.

33:35.222 --> 33:38.101
You still crossed over too early.
You ruined the rotation.

33:38.225 --> 33:44.028
- You know what, Jelena? Enough!
- Come again.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.068
Instead of riding me,
why don't you focus on Terrence?

33:47.234 --> 33:49.862
Your boyfriend,
while he's still around.

33:50.987 --> 33:54.161
- What's that supposed to mean?
- He wants to be traded.

33:57.035 --> 34:00.005
Go change now.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.944
I thought she knew
about Terrence wanting to be traded.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.065
Why wouldn't she know?

34:28.233 --> 34:30.452
I'm dead. Dead.

34:30.610 --> 34:35.081
Jelena's 100 pounds soaking wet.
You're not afraid of that.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.958
I guess that's what she deserves
after what she did to me.

34:38.118 --> 34:41.713
- Karma's a bitch, right?
- Exactly.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.818
Ahsha. Over here.

35:03.977 --> 35:06.230
<i>- I'll</i> be right back, I promise.
- Okay.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.844
Terrence Edward Wall, Jr,

35:29.002 --> 35:31.380
this is the third message
I've left for you.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.006
You're lucky you didn't come
to this premiere

35:33.173 --> 35:36.643
because I would be raining
Holy Hell on you right now.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.557
If I could reach down your throat
and rip out your heart

35:42.724 --> 35:46.149
and shove it back down your throat
for you to choke on, I would.

35:46.311 --> 35:50.441
Don't bother calling me back because
the next time we talk, it'll be in person.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.781
So get your black ass on a plane now.

36:03.078 --> 36:05.456
Looks like your boyfriend
could use an energy drink.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.378
Don't go there.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.296
Look, thank you for what you did.

36:12.420 --> 36:15.890
I know it takes a lot for me to listen,
but I heard you.

36:18.051 --> 36:20.895
I only did it
because no one else would.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.987
It's not all there,
but I'm working on it.

36:38.154 --> 36:42.660
Not even close.
And time's running out.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.397
You stole my badge.
Security came to me.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.400
- I could have lost my job!
- I'm sorry. I needed it.

37:07.559 --> 37:11.359
Sorry isn't good enough, Mia. Look,
I don't know what this is all about,

37:11.521 --> 37:14.491
but you put me in a crappy spot.
I have a child.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.493
- You don't understand.
- Help me understand.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.199
I'm looking for something.
Important.

37:22.365 --> 37:24.584
Jelena said that one of the girls
might have it.

37:24.701 --> 37:28.296
I got to all of them, almost.
Who's Ahsha?

37:29.748 --> 37:34.254
When I was in the locker room I noticed
that she was assigned my old locker.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.171
Mia, I really have to go.

37:56.983 --> 38:00.453
Derek, killer cameo, I hear. Is that why
you missed the game the other night?

38:00.612 --> 38:01.989
For your burgeoning acting career?

38:02.155 --> 38:06.251
Look, come on, Angela, acting is
just for fun. Basketball is my life.

38:06.409 --> 38:10.004
And I missed the game the other night
because of the flu. I was down,

38:10.163 --> 38:12.040
but I'm feeling better
and I'm feeling like it's a new day.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.756
A new day? Did you have the flu
or a spiritual awakening?

38:14.918 --> 38:17.797
Both. Both, I guess.
Look, having people to push you

38:17.962 --> 38:21.557
in the right direction
makes all the difference and..

38:26.304 --> 38:28.432
I feel like I have that person.

38:28.598 --> 38:31.477
I have that person
and she's terrific, a dream girl.

38:33.561 --> 38:37.407
Sounds like there might be love and
a championship in the Devils' future.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.408
Thanks for the interview, Angela.
Have a good night.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.786
- Thanks, Derek.
- No problem.

38:42.779 --> 38:44.452
Nice interview.

38:45.949 --> 38:47.917
German!

38:52.747 --> 38:54.215
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor.</i>

38:54.374 --> 38:56.752
- I should've told you about the trade.
- You made me look like a fool.

38:56.918 --> 38:58.920
Jelena's got her war paint on.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.634
- I'm pulling you off choreography.
- You can't pull me.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.140
On, I just did.

39:02.298 --> 39:05.302
You've been served. Think twice about
screwing the mother of my child.

39:05.468 --> 39:07.846
The dream was sitting in
one of the boxes tonight.

39:08.012 --> 39:09.855
He would like to pick a girl
to be in his video.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.732
How would you like
some extracurricular work?

39:11.891 --> 39:13.609
What other kind of work is there?

39:13.768 --> 39:15.065
I was just looking for Ahsha.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.526
Who are you and what do you want
with my daughter?

39:17.689 --> 39:19.783
- Stay away from me.
- I want to bash my head up

39:19.899 --> 39:22.448
against a wall until you go away,
but you're not.
