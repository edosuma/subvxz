00:13.750 --> 00:14.450

00:14.490 --> 00:15.390
- what's up?

00:15.420 --> 00:16.460
- well, after school

00:16.490 --> 00:17.390
I was thinking we should all

00:17.420 --> 00:18.620
Go hang out at the grove.

00:18.660 --> 00:19.830
You wanna-wanna?

00:19.860 --> 00:20.990
- uhh.

00:21.030 --> 00:23.760
- oooh.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.030
- we really can't.

00:25.070 --> 00:25.900
- how come?

00:25.930 --> 00:26.370
- well, uh,

00:26.400 --> 00:28.170
We have ping pong practice.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.470
- uh-huh.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.700
- shut up.

00:31.740 --> 00:32.540
- it's true.

00:32.570 --> 00:33.170
- yeah.

00:33.210 --> 00:34.170
We're all on the ping pong team.

00:34.210 --> 00:35.310
- me, andre, Robbie,

00:35.340 --> 00:36.440
Beck and jade.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.480
- there's no ping pong team

00:37.510 --> 00:39.210
At Hollywood arts.

00:39.250 --> 00:41.610
- aahh.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.650
Listen, tori, um,

00:43.680 --> 00:44.850
You're still kinda new here

00:44.880 --> 00:45.620
And there's some things

00:45.650 --> 00:51.060
That you just don't under--

00:51.060 --> 00:51.820
What kind of gum

00:51.860 --> 00:52.490
Are you chewing?

00:52.530 --> 00:54.830
- I don't know. Sinjin made it.

00:54.860 --> 00:56.060
- smell her mouth.

00:56.100 --> 00:59.260
- sure.

00:59.300 --> 01:02.430
Hmm, smells like that trip

01:02.470 --> 01:04.269
We took to acapulco last year.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.370
- yes.

01:05.410 --> 01:06.240
- oh, you have

01:06.270 --> 01:07.740
Mexican-flavored gum?

01:07.770 --> 01:09.840
- mexican is not a flavor!

01:09.880 --> 01:13.410
- thank you.

01:13.450 --> 01:14.280
- look, if you guys

01:14.310 --> 01:15.080
Don't wanna hang out with me,

01:15.120 --> 01:16.180
Then just say so.

01:16.220 --> 01:16.950
Why make up a lie

01:16.980 --> 01:17.580
That you're all

01:17.620 --> 01:19.950
On some ping pong team?

01:19.990 --> 01:20.790
- hey, tori.

01:20.820 --> 01:21.520
- how's it going?

01:21.550 --> 01:23.590
- what's up?

01:23.620 --> 01:24.160
- okay, so now

01:24.190 --> 01:24.760
You're gonna pretend

01:24.790 --> 01:25.460
Like we're not having

01:25.490 --> 01:26.630
The conversation we're having.

01:26.660 --> 01:27.960
- about what?

01:27.990 --> 01:30.200
- the big ping pong team lie.

01:30.230 --> 01:31.230
- look, if you don't believe us

01:31.260 --> 01:32.600
Then go the rec room.

01:32.630 --> 01:33.430
- you can see all the trophies

01:33.470 --> 01:34.200
We've won.

01:34.230 --> 01:36.270
- first place.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.400
- really?

01:37.440 --> 01:38.440
- yeah.

01:38.470 --> 01:39.200
- please.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.770
- okay. Then I wanna try out

01:40.810 --> 01:42.070
For the team.

01:42.110 --> 01:45.180
- ahh--

01:45.210 --> 01:46.210
- what?

01:46.250 --> 01:47.250
- look, if you wanna try out

01:47.280 --> 01:48.480
For the ping pong team,

01:48.520 --> 01:49.110
Then you have to talk

01:49.150 --> 01:50.420
To the team Captain.

01:50.450 --> 01:52.520
- fine. Who's the team Captain?

01:52.550 --> 01:53.250
- jade.

01:53.290 --> 01:55.420
- ulch.

01:55.460 --> 01:57.560
- or you can join my team.

01:57.590 --> 01:59.190
I call it Rex's all hot chick

01:59.230 --> 02:00.760
Volleyball squad.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.330
Yeah. No.

02:05.370 --> 02:06.870
- tori!

02:06.900 --> 02:08.270

02:08.300 --> 02:11.700
Snatch it off.

02:11.740 --> 02:12.700

03:35.710 --> 03:37.540
- all right, well, you can.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.440
Lane, can you come here please?

03:40.480 --> 03:42.910
Don't move.

03:42.910 --> 03:43.480
- I'm staying here

03:43.510 --> 03:46.720
Because I wanna stay here.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.020
- what's up?

03:48.050 --> 03:48.780
- jade is the Captain

03:48.820 --> 03:49.590
Of the ping pong team

03:49.620 --> 03:50.390
And I wanna try out

03:50.420 --> 03:51.620
And she says I can't.

03:51.650 --> 03:54.290
- yup, that's what I says.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.060
- oh, come on.

03:55.090 --> 03:55.960
Why do you all have to drag me

03:55.990 --> 03:58.530
Into your problems?

03:58.560 --> 03:59.860
- uh, you're the guidance

03:59.900 --> 04:01.230
Counselor here.

04:01.260 --> 04:03.670
Can we have some guidance?

04:03.700 --> 04:05.770
- all right.

04:05.800 --> 04:06.400
- all right.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.140
I've already got it loaded

04:07.170 --> 04:13.440
In here.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.140
- okay, what?

04:16.180 --> 04:17.050
- see, look what it says

04:17.079 --> 04:17.709
On the offial

04:17.750 --> 04:19.209
Hollywood arts website.

04:20.149 --> 04:22.820
- my life is slipping away.

04:22.850 --> 04:23.990
- read it.

04:24.020 --> 04:24.790
- all students

04:24.820 --> 04:25.890
Are encouraged to participate

04:25.920 --> 04:27.390
In school sanctioned events,

04:27.420 --> 04:29.560
Clubs and sports teams.

04:29.590 --> 04:30.390
- and how can I participate

04:30.430 --> 04:31.590
In ping pong

04:31.630 --> 04:33.300
If the team Captain here

04:33.330 --> 04:38.470
Refuses to even let me try out?

04:38.500 --> 04:39.870
- you gotta let her try out.

04:39.900 --> 04:42.770
- we don't need more players.

04:42.810 --> 04:45.040
- read the phone, jade.

04:45.070 --> 04:49.680
Read the phone.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:34.420 --> 05:50.240
- oh! Oh!

05:56.480 --> 05:58.080
- well?

05:58.110 --> 06:00.980
- you didn't make the team.

06:01.020 --> 06:03.290
- what? I beat everybody.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.550
- I don't care.

06:04.590 --> 06:08.090
Read the school website.

06:08.120 --> 06:08.990
- when a student tries out

06:09.030 --> 06:09.790
For a sports team

06:09.830 --> 06:11.230
For which there is no coach,

06:11.260 --> 06:12.660
The team Captain shall decide

06:12.700 --> 06:13.530
If the student is granted

06:13.560 --> 06:14.960
Or denied acceptance

06:15.000 --> 06:16.370
To the team.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.670
- Captain says denied.

06:19.700 --> 06:20.600
- but you can't--

06:20.640 --> 06:21.270
You can't just...

06:21.300 --> 06:22.940
- read the phone, tori.

06:22.970 --> 06:27.210
Read the phone.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.080
- don't you steal

06:28.110 --> 06:33.180
My phone-in-face bit.

06:40.620 --> 06:43.060
Hello, sinjin.

06:43.090 --> 06:43.890
- oh, my God.

06:43.930 --> 06:44.960
This is exactly how I dreamed

06:44.990 --> 06:47.360
It would happen.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.400
- listen. I need you

06:48.430 --> 06:49.230
To do something for me

06:49.270 --> 06:50.730
And you can't tell anyone.

06:50.770 --> 06:52.670
- I understand.

06:52.700 --> 06:53.570
- good.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.300
Now, what I need you to do is--

06:56.340 --> 06:57.810
Sinjin!

06:57.840 --> 07:03.080
- don't talk. You'll ruin it.

07:03.110 --> 07:05.450
- this isn't about kissing.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.420
- and that's how the dream

07:06.450 --> 07:08.850
Always ends.

07:08.890 --> 07:09.620
- dude, you know

07:09.650 --> 07:10.350
All those cool props

07:10.390 --> 07:11.250
And scenery pieces you made

07:11.290 --> 07:12.050
For the play Beck was in

07:12.090 --> 07:12.890
Last month?

07:12.920 --> 07:13.790
- yeah.

07:13.820 --> 07:14.360
- I need you to build

07:14.390 --> 07:15.460
Something for me.

07:15.490 --> 07:16.190
- like what?

07:16.230 --> 07:16.830
- something big enough

07:16.860 --> 07:17.930
For me to hide in and spy

07:17.960 --> 07:18.860
On the ping pong team

07:18.900 --> 07:19.590
During their next practice

07:19.630 --> 07:20.460
Because I swear,

07:20.500 --> 07:21.130
There's something wonky

07:21.160 --> 07:22.000
Going on with those guys

07:22.030 --> 07:22.730
And I'm gonna get

07:22.770 --> 07:26.230
To the bottom of the wonk!

07:26.270 --> 07:26.670
- do you know

07:26.700 --> 07:27.270
What you sprayed me with

07:27.300 --> 07:28.100
'cause I'm starting to lose

07:28.140 --> 07:30.740
Vision in my right eye?

07:30.770 --> 07:33.310
- here's a rag.

07:33.340 --> 07:34.140
- so will you build me

07:34.180 --> 07:34.880
Something I can put

07:34.910 --> 07:36.010
In the rec room and hide in?

07:36.050 --> 07:36.810
- sure.

07:36.850 --> 07:43.490
- yay! Thanks, sinjin.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.720
- here comes that feeling.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.430
- I heard that.

07:59.570 --> 08:02.170
- here we go.

08:02.210 --> 08:03.170
- yeah.

08:03.210 --> 08:04.440
- oh, my God.

08:04.470 --> 08:05.170
- man, this is the best

08:05.210 --> 08:06.540
Ping pong practice ever.

08:06.580 --> 08:08.480
- I love this game.

08:08.510 --> 08:09.280
- wait. Wait, wait.

08:09.310 --> 08:12.580
Don't lean on me.

08:12.620 --> 08:15.620
- oh. That was a foul.

08:15.650 --> 08:16.690
- you're foul.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.650
- oh. That tickles.

08:18.690 --> 08:21.160
- okay. Let's start over.

08:21.190 --> 08:22.020
- all right.

08:22.060 --> 08:23.360
- okay, okay.

08:23.390 --> 08:24.630
Wait. Let me get a drink first.

08:24.660 --> 08:25.790
- yeah, me too.

08:25.830 --> 08:26.530
- ah.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.430
- what's wrong?

08:27.460 --> 08:29.030
- I think I pulled a muscle.

08:29.070 --> 08:29.730
- you can't pull

08:29.770 --> 08:34.000
What you don't have.

08:34.039 --> 08:34.970
- what up with this machine?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.100
It ate my dollar.

08:36.140 --> 08:36.840
- all right.

08:36.870 --> 08:39.470
Let the doctor handle this.

08:39.510 --> 08:42.710
- go doc.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.710
- guys, guys, try rocking it.

08:44.750 --> 08:50.290
- all right.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.590
- whoa.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.460
Did that machine just scream

08:56.490 --> 09:07.840
Like a teenage girl?

09:07.870 --> 09:09.040
- all right.

09:09.070 --> 09:11.940
Who put me in the soda machine?

09:22.650 --> 09:25.280
- I got it. I got it. Buzz off!

09:25.320 --> 09:26.320
- why were you hiding in there

09:26.350 --> 09:28.050
Spying on us?

09:28.090 --> 09:29.350
- 'cause I had a feeling

09:29.390 --> 09:30.390
You guys' ping pong team

09:30.420 --> 09:31.320
Was just a big fake

09:31.360 --> 09:32.890
And I was right.

09:32.930 --> 09:33.720
You weren't practicing

09:33.760 --> 09:34.660
Ping pong.

09:34.690 --> 09:35.260
You were playing

09:35.290 --> 09:38.200
Retro party games.

09:38.230 --> 09:44.540
So what is up?

09:44.570 --> 09:45.600
- let's just tell her.

09:45.640 --> 09:46.340
- no.

09:46.370 --> 09:47.140
- yes.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.610
- I think we should tell her.

09:48.640 --> 09:49.540
- why don't we just drive her

09:49.580 --> 09:50.310
Out to the desert

09:50.340 --> 09:52.440
And drop her off?

09:52.480 --> 09:53.380
- Rex!

09:53.410 --> 09:57.080
- she knows too much.

09:57.120 --> 10:01.020
- tell her.

10:01.050 --> 10:01.620
- there's no real

10:01.650 --> 10:05.790
Ping pong team.

10:05.820 --> 10:07.960
- then what's this all about?

10:07.990 --> 10:09.390
- well, it all started

10:09.430 --> 10:10.860
Two years ago when the school

10:10.900 --> 10:11.930
Put that ping pong table

10:11.960 --> 10:13.430
In this room.

10:21.070 --> 10:22.570
We just walked in,

10:22.610 --> 10:25.940
And there it was.

10:25.980 --> 10:26.940
Then Robbie suggested

10:26.980 --> 10:27.710
That we form

10:27.750 --> 10:28.880
An official ping pong team

10:28.910 --> 10:30.050
Here at Hollywood arts

10:30.080 --> 10:30.620
To compete

10:30.650 --> 10:31.850
Against other schools.

10:31.880 --> 10:32.980
- so I slapped Robbie hard

10:33.020 --> 10:36.050
On top of his head.

10:36.090 --> 10:42.490
- it really hurt.

10:42.530 --> 10:44.830
It really hurt.

10:44.860 --> 10:47.430
- I heard that. So?

10:47.470 --> 10:48.600
- so a few days later,

10:48.630 --> 10:50.100
Me, andre, jade and Robbie

10:50.140 --> 10:51.300
Were hangin' out.

10:51.340 --> 10:53.540
- when cat walked up.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.410
- she was all pumped up

10:54.440 --> 10:55.640
About some fancy restaurant

10:55.670 --> 10:56.640
Her parents took her

10:56.680 --> 10:58.010
To the weekend before.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.710
- they had amazing steaks

10:59.750 --> 11:00.680
And crab cakes

11:00.710 --> 11:02.180
And lobster mashed potatoes

11:02.210 --> 11:03.850
And classy live music,

11:03.880 --> 11:05.120
And the most insane desserts

11:05.150 --> 11:07.690
I had ever tasted.

11:07.720 --> 11:08.390
- which all sounded

11:08.420 --> 11:10.050
Pretty good to us.

11:10.090 --> 11:11.460
- so I said,

11:11.490 --> 11:13.660
"well, we gotta go there."

11:13.690 --> 11:14.690
- and I told Robbie

11:14.730 --> 11:15.690
There was no way

11:15.730 --> 11:16.590
We could go there

11:16.630 --> 11:20.570
'cause it's really expensive.

11:20.600 --> 11:24.000
- where is this story going?

11:24.040 --> 11:26.770
- it actually gets weirder.

11:26.810 --> 11:28.370
- you see, when cat told us

11:28.410 --> 11:29.040
That the restaurant

11:29.070 --> 11:30.210
Was too expensive...

11:30.240 --> 11:31.280
- I remembered something

11:31.310 --> 11:31.980
Beck had told me

11:32.010 --> 11:33.210
About all the sports teams

11:33.250 --> 11:33.910
At Hollywood arts

11:33.950 --> 11:35.710
Getting a minimum of $1,500

11:35.750 --> 11:38.020
To pay for travel and equipment.

11:38.050 --> 11:50.290
And that's when I got the idea.

11:50.330 --> 11:52.930
- well, what was the idea?

11:52.970 --> 11:54.070
- oh, right,

11:54.100 --> 11:57.770
I was telling a story.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.200
I said, "maybe we should form

11:59.240 --> 12:00.970
"a fake ping pong team,

12:01.010 --> 12:02.710
"take the 1,500 bucks

12:02.740 --> 12:04.380
"and use the money for all of us

12:04.410 --> 12:05.380
"to have a fancy dinner

12:05.410 --> 12:05.940
"at the restaurant

12:05.980 --> 12:07.680
Cat told us about."

12:07.710 --> 12:08.710
- at first, we thought

12:08.750 --> 12:10.110
Jade's idea was crazy.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.150
- but after we exchanged

12:15.190 --> 12:19.290
Some looks...

12:19.320 --> 12:20.190
- we started to think

12:20.230 --> 12:23.230
It might be a pretty cool idea.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.560
- but then Robbie said, "wait."

12:25.600 --> 12:26.230
- I reminded everyone

12:26.270 --> 12:27.330
That all sports teams

12:27.370 --> 12:28.130
Are required to have

12:28.170 --> 12:31.440
At least one faculty advisor.

12:31.470 --> 12:32.500
- so we went to

12:32.540 --> 12:34.770
The only teacher we could trust.

12:34.810 --> 12:38.080
- sikowitz.

12:38.110 --> 12:39.310
- but he told us our plan

12:39.340 --> 12:45.050
Was way too devious and illegal.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.020
- but then he said,

12:46.050 --> 12:46.980
"hey, did you hear

12:47.020 --> 12:47.750
"that principal eikner

12:47.790 --> 12:53.460
Might get fired?"

12:53.490 --> 12:55.090
- help me.

12:55.130 --> 12:56.690
- see, the principal's boss...

12:56.730 --> 12:59.330
- the superintendent.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.000
- ...Was mad 'cause

13:00.030 --> 13:01.230
Hollywood arts didn't have

13:01.270 --> 13:02.700
Any winning sports teams.

13:02.730 --> 13:04.040
- and he told principal eikner,

13:04.070 --> 13:05.000
"at least one team

13:05.040 --> 13:05.740
"better bring home

13:05.770 --> 13:06.770
"a trophy this year

13:06.810 --> 13:09.210
Or else you're fired."

13:09.240 --> 13:10.710
- so I said to sikowitz,

13:10.740 --> 13:12.140
What if the five of us...

13:12.180 --> 13:13.840
Six.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.150
Six of us, pretend to go

13:15.180 --> 13:16.550
To a ping pong tournament...

13:16.580 --> 13:17.880
- take the 1,500 bucks

13:17.920 --> 13:19.220
The school gives us...

13:19.250 --> 13:20.250
- use 400 of it to buy

13:20.290 --> 13:22.320
A nice trophy for the school...

13:22.350 --> 13:22.920
- which would keep

13:22.950 --> 13:23.820
Principal eikner

13:23.860 --> 13:25.320
From getting fired...

13:25.360 --> 13:25.820
- and then use

13:25.860 --> 13:26.560
The rest of our money

13:26.590 --> 13:27.660
To take our favorite teacher

13:27.690 --> 13:28.560
To the restaurant

13:28.590 --> 13:29.830
Cat told us about...

13:29.860 --> 13:31.100
- and have the most amazing

13:31.130 --> 13:33.630
Dinner of our lives.

13:33.670 --> 13:34.430
- and then,

13:34.470 --> 13:37.870
Sikowitz was on board.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.040
- so you guys formed

13:39.070 --> 13:40.100
A fake ping pong team

13:40.140 --> 13:41.510
So you could get some money,

13:41.540 --> 13:42.870
Buy a trophy for the school,

13:42.910 --> 13:44.140
Save the principal's job

13:44.180 --> 13:45.240
And take sikowitz out

13:45.280 --> 13:47.510
For a big, fancy dinner?

13:47.550 --> 13:48.480
- yeah, I guess we could

13:48.510 --> 13:52.380
Have just told it that way.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.850
- so, are you gonna bust us now

13:54.890 --> 13:56.650
And ruin everything?

13:56.690 --> 13:59.220
- no. If...

13:59.260 --> 14:01.130
- if what?

14:01.160 --> 14:03.130
- and I'm very proud

14:03.160 --> 14:05.360
To announce the newest member

14:05.400 --> 14:06.760
Of the Hollywood arts

14:06.800 --> 14:08.230
Ping pong team,

14:08.270 --> 14:13.140
Tori "the paddlepus" vega.

14:18.580 --> 14:20.710
Now, wish us all luck

14:20.750 --> 14:22.680
And hopefully we'll bring home

14:22.710 --> 14:25.920
Yet another first place trophy

14:25.950 --> 14:29.920
For Hollywood arts.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.460
- yeah!

14:31.490 --> 14:36.490
- all team members in my van.

14:36.530 --> 14:43.430
Thank you. Thank you.

14:43.470 --> 14:44.800
- hey, look at that.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.070
Shag carpeting.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.380
- oh, my God.

14:58.420 --> 15:00.250
- oh.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.590
- oh my God, best food ever.

15:02.620 --> 15:03.620
- right?

15:03.660 --> 15:05.960
- so good.

15:05.990 --> 15:08.260
- to ping pong.

15:08.290 --> 15:11.730
- to ping pong.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.960
- to the pong to the ping.

15:13.000 --> 15:21.740
- aw, shut up.

15:21.770 --> 15:22.370
- I can't believe

15:22.410 --> 15:23.570
What she's wearing.

15:23.610 --> 15:24.280
- yes, I'm wearing

15:24.310 --> 15:30.250
A ping pong uniform.

15:30.280 --> 15:30.980
- how could you not think

15:31.020 --> 15:32.350
To bring a fancy dress?

15:32.380 --> 15:32.920
- I don't know.

15:32.950 --> 15:34.150
I just didn't, okay?

15:34.190 --> 15:34.920
- you said you reminded

15:34.950 --> 15:36.290
Everyone to bring nice clothes.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.020
- I did.

15:37.060 --> 15:37.990
- you didn't remind me.

15:38.020 --> 15:43.590
- whoops.

15:43.630 --> 15:45.100
- how's everyone doing?

15:45.130 --> 15:45.860
- oh.

15:45.900 --> 15:46.700
- it's so good.

15:46.730 --> 15:47.830
- it's amazing.

15:47.870 --> 15:49.970
- good. Good, good.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.270
- oh, wait, ma'am.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.840
- yes?

15:53.870 --> 15:56.610
- what is this awesome dip?

15:56.640 --> 15:57.910
- that's caviar.

15:57.940 --> 15:59.380
- it's fantastic.

15:59.410 --> 16:01.580
Can I get a big bowl of it?

16:01.610 --> 16:02.910
- a big bowl?

16:02.950 --> 16:05.450
- yeah. Like a bowl for soup,

16:05.480 --> 16:06.020
But filled with

16:06.050 --> 16:07.690
This caviar stuff?

16:07.720 --> 16:08.920
- ah, sure.

16:08.950 --> 16:09.720
I'll bring that right

16:09.750 --> 16:11.860
To your table.

16:11.890 --> 16:21.070
- you're very kind.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.500
- is everyone happy tonight?

16:23.540 --> 16:25.070
- oh, wonderful.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.740
- how is your drink, sir?

16:26.770 --> 16:29.540
- very moist. Thank you.

16:29.570 --> 16:30.140
- two more people

16:30.180 --> 16:30.770
Are complaining

16:30.810 --> 16:32.040
There's no live music.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.680
- so offer them a free dessert.

16:33.710 --> 16:35.710
- I did. They're still upset.

16:35.750 --> 16:39.080
- excuse me.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.050
- here you are.

16:40.090 --> 16:50.590
- oh, thank you, dear.

16:50.630 --> 16:51.600
- are you sure?

16:51.630 --> 16:52.960
- yes. They can't grow

16:53.000 --> 16:55.970
Lobster-flavored potatoes.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.240
- uh. Uhhh--

17:02.270 --> 17:04.140
Uh, it's so good,

17:04.180 --> 17:06.910
But I'm so full.

17:06.950 --> 17:10.880
- come on, man up. Here we go.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.780
Oh, there it is. There it is.

17:13.819 --> 17:15.589
That's nice, isn't it? Just...

17:15.619 --> 17:16.420
- thank you.

17:16.450 --> 17:17.619
- breathe through it.

17:17.660 --> 17:21.230
- you're a good friend.

17:21.260 --> 17:22.329
- okay.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.460
What if, like, a farmer planted

17:24.500 --> 17:25.700
A lobster and a potato

17:25.730 --> 17:28.300
In the same hole?

17:28.329 --> 17:31.700
Maybe it would grow a lobtato.

17:31.740 --> 17:32.640
- yes, cat.

17:32.670 --> 17:33.870
A lobtato would grow.

17:33.910 --> 17:36.370
I'll tell the farmers.

17:36.410 --> 17:38.210
- here's your check.

17:38.240 --> 17:47.820
- thank you.

17:47.850 --> 17:51.460
- what the hair bones?

17:51.490 --> 17:52.660
- what?

17:52.690 --> 17:55.930
- it's $1,300.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.090
- what?

17:57.130 --> 17:59.300
- it's never been over 700.

17:59.330 --> 18:01.530
- way to go, tori.

18:01.570 --> 18:02.630
- I ordered the same thing

18:02.670 --> 18:03.400
You did.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.170
- wait, wait,

18:04.200 --> 18:05.600
I see the problem.

18:05.640 --> 18:06.970
They mistakenly charged us

18:07.010 --> 18:10.840
An extra $600 for caviar.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.710
- oh.

18:13.750 --> 18:16.480
- excuse me, sir?

18:16.510 --> 18:18.480
- hi. Is anything wrong?

18:18.520 --> 18:19.550
- yes.

18:19.580 --> 18:20.850
We were mistakenly charged

18:20.890 --> 18:24.320
For $600 worth of caviar.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.790
- oh, that's not a mistake.

18:25.820 --> 18:26.860
That awkward young man

18:26.890 --> 18:33.760
Ordered a large bowl of caviar.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.500
- man, what were you thinking?

18:36.530 --> 18:38.240
- I didn't order any caviar.

18:38.270 --> 18:39.240
- Robbie.

18:39.270 --> 18:39.770
- I didn't know

18:39.800 --> 18:41.210
It was that expensive.

18:41.240 --> 18:45.010
- what are you talking about?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.110
- all right, all right,

18:46.140 --> 18:51.350
All right! Hush.

18:51.380 --> 18:56.050
Robbie can't help what he is.

18:56.090 --> 18:58.760
Nevertheless, we don't have

18:58.790 --> 19:02.290
Enough money to pay the check.

19:02.330 --> 19:03.830
- well, sir, I'm sorry,

19:03.860 --> 19:05.360
But payment is required,

19:05.400 --> 19:06.600
Or I'm going to have

19:06.630 --> 19:08.500
To call the police.

19:08.530 --> 19:10.500
- the police?

19:10.540 --> 19:11.770
- oh, no.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.610
- I'm sorry.

19:14.640 --> 19:20.080
- jail?

19:20.110 --> 19:26.880
- I am not going to jail.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.250
- Claude. Claude.

19:28.290 --> 19:29.690
- yes, Mr. Conrad?

19:29.720 --> 19:30.590
- where is the live music?

19:30.620 --> 19:31.260
- well...

19:31.290 --> 19:31.990
- I thought Perry and Jordan

19:32.020 --> 19:32.720
Were performing.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.190
- there was a golfing accident.

19:34.230 --> 19:37.090
Perry took a ball to the head.

19:37.130 --> 19:37.730
- and you didn't book

19:37.760 --> 19:38.700
Another music act?

19:38.730 --> 19:41.700
- I didn't find out until 4:30.

19:41.730 --> 19:42.870
- people come here

19:42.900 --> 19:44.640
For classy, live music.

19:44.670 --> 19:45.400
Do you know how many customers

19:45.440 --> 19:46.640
Are complaining?

19:46.670 --> 19:47.870
- sir, I didn't have the time--

19:47.910 --> 19:50.640
- uh, guys, guys,

19:50.680 --> 19:52.310
I think I may be able to fix

19:52.340 --> 19:56.810
Both our problems here.

19:56.850 --> 20:00.380
Give me your dress.

20:00.420 --> 20:02.450
- what?

20:02.490 --> 20:06.590
- give me your dress.
