00:18.760 --> 00:19.640
Have you seen Chris?

00:21.400 --> 00:23.520
-Have you seen Chris?
-No, sorry.

[Pete] Hiya.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.680
Is that the boyfriend?

00:40.760 --> 00:42.600
[Jenny] Oh, thank you very much.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.840
So, where is he, then? It's Chris, right?

00:44.920 --> 00:47.480
[chuckles] Dad's been talking
to you, then.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.200
Why can't he just mind his own...

00:49.280 --> 00:50.120
-[Pete] Hey...
-[Jenny] ...business?

00:50.200 --> 00:51.680
[Pete] Be nice about my best friend.

00:56.840 --> 00:57.680
Night night.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.800
Hey. No telling that best friend
about this, yeah?

01:04.280 --> 01:05.640
That's the deal.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.120

How was Heaven?

02:33.040 --> 02:34.160
Useless.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.160
-Nothing?
-No.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.880
What would Jenny be doing,
going to a place like that?

02:40.960 --> 02:43.880
[sighs] What's she doing, full stop?

02:45.960 --> 02:48.880
-So, what do you wanna do now?
-Wait here.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.000
The boyfriend's scooter

02:53.080 --> 02:55.400
plus two rail tickets
equals Jenny was here.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.400
And that's all I've got right now.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.800
[Sophie] We need the latest
on Zoe Chahal's laptop.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.360
Emma, can you chase it up?

03:24.920 --> 03:27.000
-Call me if you need me.
-[cell phone ringing]

03:27.080 --> 03:28.480
Henry's got dialysis.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.600
Hi. Yeah, I'm just leaving.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.600
[Henry] Can you go home, on your way,

03:32.680 --> 03:34.320
-and get my Superdry shirt?
-[Sophie]  What?

03:34.400 --> 03:35.560
My new shirt in my room.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.560
Unless you washed it. Pick it up, yeah?

03:37.640 --> 03:40.160
I can't, 'cause I want to be with you
for any updates.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.720
Yeah, and I want my shirt. So, thanks.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.840
[inhales sharply]

04:16.839 --> 04:19.399
[Lauren] Yeah, you can't
keep him here as well.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.040
[Jojo] What do you want me to do?
Untie him and let him go?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.360
[Sophie] For God's sake.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.600
[Sophie] I gather my colleague asked
for some names of people

06:07.680 --> 06:09.520
who might bear a grudge against you.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.040
And you couldn't think of anybody?

06:13.520 --> 06:15.800
None at all. No, really.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.120
Well, can I ask you to have another think?

06:22.560 --> 06:25.160
As a teacher,
you might not be aware of it,

06:25.240 --> 06:26.920
but for parents, well...

06:28.240 --> 06:30.880
Well, you're a parent too, of course.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.480
But for me, teachers loom large,

06:34.560 --> 06:38.320
and if any of them don't like my kids,
or pick on them, then...

06:39.880 --> 06:41.360
Okay, what am I saying?

06:43.360 --> 06:44.400
As a teacher...

06:45.240 --> 06:49.080
you might not realize
how sensitive people can be.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.200
So...

06:50.800 --> 06:52.840
Please, could you just go back
a few years,

06:52.920 --> 06:55.880
and think of anyone who you could have
inadvertently upset?

06:57.240 --> 06:59.040
It might seem like nothing...

06:59.760 --> 07:02.960
And nobody's gonna get all heavy-handed.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.880
I'm doing everything I can
to find out who's doing this to you.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.440
'Cause someone is.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.400
I will have a think.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.440
Okay, good.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.920
Oh, sorry, I've got to fly.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.960
Henry's got a hospital appointment.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.440
Yeah, please...
Please you must go, of course.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.960
Thank you for coming here, like this.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.880
Your kindness, it...

07:40.960 --> 07:42.360
It means a lot.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.800
[Jojo]  If you weren't dealing drugs, Sia,
we wouldn't be in this position.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.400
-Dad--
-Please, I'm trying to think.

08:05.480 --> 08:09.520
-Yeah, I know, I was just gonna say--
-Please, please, please!

[cell phone ringing]

08:15.720 --> 08:17.720
-Who is it?
-It's work. It's fine.

08:17.800 --> 08:18.760
Phil, what's up?

08:21.920 --> 08:24.520
Okay. Okay, I'm on my way.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.400
-[Lauren] Where are you going?
-Two fermentors have shut down.

08:27.480 --> 08:28.680
Well, Phil's there. He'll deal with it.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.520
They've shut down, Lauren!
They're cooling as we speak.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.760
Do you want me to go bankrupt,
as well as all this?

08:34.720 --> 08:38.480
Don't let your mum make any decisions.
Don't let her do anything.

08:42.679 --> 08:43.520
[Pete] You want some lunch?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.520
-Nah.
-[Pete] 'Cause you should eat.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.200
You need to eat. Listen to your mum now.

08:49.040 --> 08:50.160
I'm good.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.240
[cell phone ringing]

09:03.440 --> 09:04.360
Yes?

09:06.040 --> 09:07.040

09:09.840 --> 09:11.600
Yeah, I can hear you, yeah.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.720
Yeah.

09:16.480 --> 09:17.400
Yeah.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.320
I'm on my own.

09:24.760 --> 09:25.600
Yeah.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.680
-Yeah.
-[Pete] What?

09:32.240 --> 09:33.200
What do you got?

09:34.080 --> 09:35.280
Got it, yeah.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.880
-Talk to me, what?
-Some guy...

09:37.960 --> 09:40.800
for £5,000 will tell me where Jenny is.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.440
-What? For five grand?
-Yeah, I know, but he knows I'm her dad.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.320
And he knows my number.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.000
But also he knows exactly
what she's wearing.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.920
-So, he knows something.
-Right.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.520
-Five grand.
-Cash and no police.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.240
Yeah, there's a surprise.

09:57.320 --> 10:00.040
-[Sophie] Your jumper, Henry!
-[Henry] Mom, it's nothing.

10:00.120 --> 10:03.680
-But, Henry, it has blood all over it.
-Yeah, there was a fight.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.760
A fight? With who? Where? Why not tell me?

10:06.840 --> 10:09.640
-When was this? Don't fight. You can't.
-I wasn't.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.360
I just got bumped into and bled on.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.480
I don't know who they were. It's nothing.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.640
What are you doing with those?

10:15.720 --> 10:17.080
That's a brand-new shirt. Henry!

10:17.160 --> 10:19.120
-[nurse] Are those my scissors?
-[Henry] Yeah, thanks.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.520
I wanna wear this this afternoon.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.480
-Putting it on now?
-Yeah.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.120
Right, let's see.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.760
Henry Mason,

10:27.840 --> 10:30.840
-your assigned surgeon is...
-Tom Delaney.

10:30.920 --> 10:33.760
-And you last saw Dr. Delaney?
-This morning.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.880
They see quite a lot of each other.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.680
[clears throat] We're neighbors,
you know, so...

10:41.760 --> 10:43.440
-Okay?
-Okay.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.920
-[Tom] You have to say what it's for.
-So, you told 'em, obviously.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.640
-I said a car.
-Anything nice?

11:00.720 --> 11:02.520
-For five grand?
-Right.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.200
As requested.

11:04.280 --> 11:07.120
So, take the metro, make the drop.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.280
Leave the station,
go up top, and I'll take over.

11:10.360 --> 11:13.160
-That's leaving it all to you.
-Yeah, you're doing as you're told.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.040
-What happens then?
-I'll call you.

11:15.120 --> 11:18.800
All right, I'm sending you a link, right?
You download it.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.400
It's a tracking app.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.160
Once you've signed up,
you can see where I am.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.600
But stick to the plan.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.720
Oh, and eat the sandwich.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.720
[gasps]

11:37.280 --> 11:39.320
What were you playing at?

11:39.400 --> 11:42.320
What was your game?
What were you doing sneaking around?

11:42.400 --> 11:45.000
I was delivering a package,
and then I saw...

11:45.080 --> 11:48.240
So, no ringing the doorbell?
Just walk straight in?

11:48.320 --> 11:49.840
You do that everywhere you go, Martin?

11:49.920 --> 11:51.680
I saw those feet and legs.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.080
I saw what I saw.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.760
Yeah, you saw me stark naked.
That's exactly what you saw.

11:56.680 --> 12:03.240
You know that I shower naked after a swim,
because you like to watch me, don't you?

12:03.800 --> 12:05.960
But don't worry.
I won't be telling my dad.

12:06.440 --> 12:07.720
I mean, I mustn't.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.360
Because if he knew...

12:10.200 --> 12:14.400
If he knew you had been snooping
on his little baby,

12:15.000 --> 12:16.760
and watching me undress...

12:18.360 --> 12:19.320
Well...

12:21.160 --> 12:22.120
He'd kill you.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.920
No, he wouldn't kill you,

12:24.000 --> 12:27.600
but he'd go to the police
and he would tell them that you're a pedo!

12:28.440 --> 12:30.480
And I'd have to back him up.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.160
And that would be horrible.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.120
Because those kind of accusations...

12:38.520 --> 12:39.960
They... [inhales]

12:41.880 --> 12:43.280
They stick.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.160
Oh, God!

12:49.800 --> 12:51.200
So, let's say nothing.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.320
[exhales]

13:35.000 --> 13:37.400
[train stops]

14:03.520 --> 14:07.920
-What are you doing? I gave you that app.
-It's one of the bouncers from Heaven.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.800
He's gonna recognize you, ain't he?

14:09.880 --> 14:12.240
Stick to the plan.
Keep back till I call you.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.160
-[yelling]
-[both grunting]

14:51.880 --> 14:54.480
[Tom] Jenny! Where's Jenny? Where is she?

14:56.200 --> 14:57.360
Where is she?

15:00.160 --> 15:01.440
[pizza boy] What the hell, man? Fuck!

15:01.520 --> 15:03.120
"Keep back till you call," yeah?

15:03.200 --> 15:04.640
[bouncer groaning]

15:04.720 --> 15:06.600
He just ran out in front of me!

15:06.680 --> 15:09.160
-[groaning]
-Shit! Shit, I'm not insured!

15:09.240 --> 15:11.080
Take your bike and fuck off.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.920
-Go on, leave.
-Jesus! [groans]

15:13.920 --> 15:16.240
-[stammers] Is he okay?
-He's fine. I'm a doctor.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.000
Dislocated shoulder. We're both doctors.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.600
We might be able to put this back in.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.360
The quicker it's done, the better. Go!

15:21.440 --> 15:23.160
No, wait! [groans]

15:23.240 --> 15:26.160
-Be quiet, or I'll...
-[grunts]

15:26.240 --> 15:28.520
Now tell the kind gentleman he can go.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.200
-Tell him.
-Thanks, mate. I'm fine.

15:32.760 --> 15:33.640
Okay.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.120
[Tom] My daughter, Jenny.

15:36.760 --> 15:37.800
[bouncer] I don't know where she is.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.240
-I think you do.
-I don't! I don't.

15:40.320 --> 15:43.160
You told me exactly what she was wearing.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.120
Yeah, 'cause she did come to Heaven.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.480
She was looking for Bobby,
but he wasn't there, so she left. [pants]

15:48.560 --> 15:51.000
-Who the fuck's Bobby?
-[bouncer] The guy you saw.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.920
The guy you were speaking to. My boss.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.480
And then you're asking for her.

15:54.560 --> 15:57.960
I sent that girl to get your number.
That's it. I was trying it on.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.520
-That's not it.
-[groans]

15:59.600 --> 16:01.880
-Who was my daughter with?
-No one. No one.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.040
-She was with a young guy.
-She was on her own.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.560
And she just came and went!

16:05.640 --> 16:07.280
[sobs]

16:11.560 --> 16:12.960
Call an ambulance.

[cell phone ringing]

16:18.720 --> 16:19.560
Yes, hello?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.120
Yeah, I'll come in. I'm coming now.

16:24.000 --> 16:24.920
[panting]

16:25.000 --> 16:27.200
Carrie's gone AWOL from school.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.600
-I'll call you.
-All right, mate.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.160
[door closes]

16:33.920 --> 16:35.960
[footsteps approaching]

16:37.320 --> 16:38.240
[Jojo exhales]

16:40.360 --> 16:41.400
What?

16:42.440 --> 16:44.760
You tell me not to do anything,
and then she...

16:45.480 --> 16:47.120
She sends Martin home.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.960
Sends him...
What do you mean, "sends him home"?

16:50.440 --> 16:53.000
It's okay. Everything's sorted
and Martin is fine.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.080
Well, great.
In that case, I'll pop the kettle on.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.440
We can do some finger painting.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.280
-Dad, I said I took care of it, okay?
-No!

16:58.360 --> 17:01.640
Sia, not okay! What did you do?
What have you done?

17:03.360 --> 17:06.760
I told him I'd caught him watching me
undress by the swimming pool

17:06.839 --> 17:09.359
on more than one occasion
and it seemed to do the trick.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.119
But I said I wouldn't say anything to you.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.440
So can we please concentrate
on getting rid of the body?

17:17.480 --> 17:18.960
[Tim] No news, I'm afraid.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.760
I thought Ellen might know,
being Carrie's best friend.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.640
But, no luck there, either.

17:24.520 --> 17:28.040
Can I have a quick word with Ellen alone?

17:28.680 --> 17:31.560
Just here. It will only take a minute.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.600
She said not to say. And I promised.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.680
She might not be there anyway.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.120
But it's not a bad place if she is.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.760
She and Jenny go there a lot.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.960
It's where their mom worked.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.600
Would you like some tea, Doctor?

18:28.680 --> 18:29.720
Helen.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.840
That's right. You work here...
Well, help out.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.240
-[Helen] Volunteer.
-I remember Rachel saying.

18:36.720 --> 18:37.920
Dr. Delaney?

18:39.120 --> 18:41.080
Alex Miller, your wife's assistant.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.360
-Yeah.
-[Alex] Welcome. What a lovely surprise.

18:43.440 --> 18:46.160
Thanks. I'm actually looking
for my daughter.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.920
Which one? Carrie or Jenny?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.600
Mind, I haven't seen either today.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.640
They'll be in their mom's office
if they're here.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.280
Milk and sugar?

18:53.360 --> 18:55.720
I'm actually fine at the moment. Thanks.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.480
No, they're not here. Sorry.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.760
Can I ask when they last came?

19:06.480 --> 19:07.840
[Alex] Three, four days ago.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.160
How often do they come?

19:10.800 --> 19:13.880
Oh, that's easy. Come and see.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.560
[all laughing]

20:11.640 --> 20:14.360
Poor old Dad, always outnumbered. [laughs]

20:14.440 --> 20:16.120
[Alex] So, when they come in...

20:17.120 --> 20:20.240
they always leave hearts on the date.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.920
So, yeah, both here four days ago.

20:25.080 --> 20:25.960
And...

20:29.040 --> 20:30.240
They come a lot.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.200
And no one ever thought to call
and let me know?

20:34.440 --> 20:35.880
That they have this...

20:36.400 --> 20:37.720
This...

20:37.800 --> 20:40.560
You think that's all right?
You think this is helping them

20:40.640 --> 20:42.680
get over their mother and move forwards?

20:43.440 --> 20:46.320
We've hoped so.
They always seem happy here.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.160
This is creepy. This is like some shrine.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.080
Oh... Well, if you don't like it--

20:52.160 --> 20:54.480
[chuckles] I don't like it, no.

20:56.120 --> 20:59.880
You got people I don't know
with their arms round my wife.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.520
Where were some of these even taken?

21:01.600 --> 21:05.120
It's like I didn't know her.
Like she's someone else.

21:11.680 --> 21:12.680
God.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.160
You've any idea where I might find Carrie?

21:17.720 --> 21:19.640
She and Jenny never mention anywhere?

21:22.200 --> 21:24.520
You might try the City Art Gallery.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.400
Rachel used to go there a lot
with the kids when she was ill.

21:29.120 --> 21:29.960
[scoffs]

21:38.960 --> 21:42.960
One of the strangest things
I've ever had to do.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.240
Sorry, what is this?

21:44.320 --> 21:48.840
A list of those I have had
any argument with over the years.

21:48.920 --> 21:52.160
But, really, they are all nothing.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.960
I've never even thought to report
one of these people, so...

21:56.920 --> 22:00.000
It's bizarre to think that,

22:00.680 --> 22:04.000
without knowing it,
I could have upset someone that much.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.640
[Emma] Thanks, Mrs. Chahal.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.280
Your cooperation's noted.

22:35.800 --> 22:36.760
Is that one of yours?

22:38.800 --> 22:40.280
[whispers] I'll go.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.640
[Henry] Mom, you can go if you have to.

22:43.120 --> 22:47.240
In fact, even if you don't, go.
I'll get home on me own.

22:52.840 --> 22:53.720
I'll be back.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.360
Zoe Chahal's list of people
who might bear a grudge.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.640
The fourth one might interest you.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.320
Let's pay them a visit.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.000
-What do you think?
-[speaking indistinctly]

23:33.160 --> 23:34.120
[indistinct chatter]

23:34.200 --> 23:36.320
[woman] Boys, calm down.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.280
[indistinct chatter]

24:26.920 --> 24:28.760
[Tom] You don't mind me sitting here?

24:30.280 --> 24:31.120
[Carrie] Course not.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.760
I had no idea you and Jenny
went to your mom's center.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.040
We thought it might upset you.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.000
You didn't need to know.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.400
You never asked us where we were.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.400
[exhales]

24:48.440 --> 24:50.240
[Carrie] All we do is sit in there.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.200
It feels...

24:55.000 --> 24:56.240
I don't know.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.760
We just like it.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.440
[Tom] Hey...

25:03.920 --> 25:06.080
I'm looking for Jenny as hard as I can.

25:10.280 --> 25:11.720
Do you want to see something?

25:19.600 --> 25:21.040
She loves me the best.

25:22.640 --> 25:23.480
[Jenny]  All of us.

25:26.720 --> 25:27.720
Cheese.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.240
I'm scared...

25:34.960 --> 25:36.640
of losing Jenny, too.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.760
Okay, listen.

25:40.680 --> 25:42.640
I know one thing, okay?

25:44.480 --> 25:46.000
Jenny went to this bar,

25:46.480 --> 25:48.240
a place called Heaven Lounge.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.440
She went there looking for the owner,
a man called Bobby.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.280
But that's all I know.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.880
Do you know who this Bobby is?

26:01.600 --> 26:02.480
No.

26:05.240 --> 26:06.760
You wanna help me find out?

26:08.640 --> 26:09.800
Yes.

26:09.880 --> 26:10.760
Great.

26:11.240 --> 26:12.320
Let's...

26:23.840 --> 26:24.720
[sighs]

26:24.800 --> 26:26.480
[Jojo groaning]

26:27.680 --> 26:30.440
-Be careful.
-What do you mean, "careful"? He's dead.

26:30.520 --> 26:31.360
Here.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.560
Oh, Jesus.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.400
-Just push, then.
-I am! [grunts]

26:39.480 --> 26:40.480
[Jojo grunts]

26:42.840 --> 26:43.680
[door bell rings]

26:43.760 --> 26:46.400
-That's it. Right.
-[Sia] Now where?

26:46.480 --> 26:47.560
The police are here.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.160
This isn't about the party.
This is a separate issue.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.720
Do either of you recall
ever having a dispute

27:01.800 --> 27:04.880
or argument with Sia's French teacher,
Mrs. Chahal?

27:05.600 --> 27:06.960
She runs drama club.

27:09.720 --> 27:12.880
-Go on.
-Well, if you mean, um...

27:12.960 --> 27:15.680
when she didn't give Sia the part
in  Grease,  yes.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.120
Yes, we had words.

27:18.200 --> 27:24.120
I think that Sia would have been
a wonderful Sandy, and I told her so.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.680
We were disappointed.

27:25.760 --> 27:27.560
Maybe we said a few things
we shouldn't have said.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.000
Like what?

27:31.480 --> 27:32.800
I said she was stupid.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.040
Possibly fat.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.320
[Emma] And that's it?

27:38.920 --> 27:42.720
I did go see Mrs. Chahal once more
to ask her to reconsider,

27:42.800 --> 27:43.880
but she said no.

27:44.680 --> 27:47.200
-And then what?
-Then nothing.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.560
[exhales] Look...

27:52.440 --> 27:53.840
can we speak outside?

27:59.000 --> 28:00.080
Are you showing us something?

28:00.640 --> 28:02.840
-No.
-Well, then here's fine.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.640
Well, look...

28:09.560 --> 28:11.320
I know she's my daughter,

28:11.400 --> 28:12.880
and I love her dearly.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.880
But, singing-wise, she's talentless.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.840
She's dreadful. She can't sing a note.

28:16.920 --> 28:20.800
I am delighted when Mrs. Chahal says,
"Not in my musical, thanks."

28:20.880 --> 28:23.400
'Cause, frankly, the girl does not
need encouragement.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.720
What about your wife and Sia?
Did they take it further?

28:27.800 --> 28:31.240
No, my wife, she's just hot air.
And Sia... Yeah, she's...

28:31.320 --> 28:33.720
She's got a touch of the devil in her,
but only for fun.

28:34.720 --> 28:37.080
-What sort of fun?
-I don't know, like...

28:37.920 --> 28:39.560
Like after their exams,

28:39.640 --> 28:41.360
getting into my drinks cabinet.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.680
She copied the key. [chuckles]

28:43.760 --> 28:45.720
What you can get off the Internet
these days.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.400
All you need is a lighter, a bit of tape,

28:48.480 --> 28:52.000
scissors, one of them flimsy coffee tins,
and you're away.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.680
New key, empty drinks cabinet. [laughs]

28:57.240 --> 29:00.200
But that's just for fun
and being young, isn't it?

29:02.160 --> 29:03.920
Well, thank you. For now.

29:09.000 --> 29:09.840
[sighs]

29:11.280 --> 29:14.520
So, do you reckon youthful fun could run
to getting compromising photographs

29:14.600 --> 29:16.560
of Zoe Chahal
and sticking them in her locker?

29:16.640 --> 29:19.280
I don't know.
I don't get the whole family.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.360
Maybe I could try and trace the boy
in the Zoe photos?

29:24.160 --> 29:26.480
It could be tricky, but give it a go.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.560
See you tomorrow.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.000
Dad, where's Chris?

29:35.080 --> 29:37.080
No idea. Have you tried his mobile?

29:37.160 --> 29:39.560
He's not answering,
but he's supposed to take me.

29:39.640 --> 29:41.400
Well, then something must have come up.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.280
Let me do this,
and then I'll take you to the film.

29:44.360 --> 29:48.360
No, I want to go with Chris. He promised.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.880
That's why I'm worried. Where could he be?

29:52.560 --> 29:54.080
What do you want me to say?

29:57.240 --> 29:58.440
You don't care.

30:04.840 --> 30:07.280
Has it got a contacts page?

30:09.280 --> 30:11.080
[Carrie] Not that sort of website.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.440
What about looking up a census?

30:13.520 --> 30:15.000
We're doing them at school.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.480
Well, we need a name.

30:18.560 --> 30:22.680
But... No, good girl.
Yes, Companies House.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.320
You can...

30:29.280 --> 30:30.960
Heaven Lounge.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.320
[Carrie] Director Archie Roberts.

30:38.280 --> 30:40.920
What if Bobby's a nickname for Roberts?

30:42.200 --> 30:45.240
Roberts is Bobby. Yeah, let's try that.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.680
Archie Roberts.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.960
Bingo. That's him.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.120
We could see
if he's posted anything online.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.800
-Okay.
-[knocking at door]

31:00.880 --> 31:01.720
[door opens]

31:01.800 --> 31:02.800
[Carrie] Ellen!

31:02.880 --> 31:05.400
Can Carrie come round and watch a film
and stay for supper?

31:05.480 --> 31:07.360
Please, Dad? Please.

31:07.440 --> 31:09.800
-[Ellen] He agreed!
-Well, he didn't disagree.

31:09.880 --> 31:11.640
[Ellen] I have something to show you.

31:12.880 --> 31:13.720
Hi.

31:13.800 --> 31:14.720
[sighs]

31:16.240 --> 31:17.080
Hi.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.440
I might have engineered that.

31:20.560 --> 31:23.880
First off,
did Henry's dialysis obs come through?

31:27.320 --> 31:28.360
How is it?

31:31.280 --> 31:32.360
[sighs]

31:33.000 --> 31:34.840
Not... great.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.360
Could be worse.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.480
But not great.

31:41.880 --> 31:43.440
Still need a donor.

31:44.920 --> 31:45.880
Telling it like it is.

31:47.760 --> 31:48.600
[chuckles]

31:53.680 --> 31:55.240
This is the second reason.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.480
[Tom sighs]

32:03.520 --> 32:05.720
[Sophie] I was worried
this wouldn't happen again.

32:09.200 --> 32:11.440
[Tom] I was worried
this wasn't what you wanted.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.720
When there's no chance
of any kids walking in...

32:24.960 --> 32:26.440
And we're not rushing...

32:27.600 --> 32:29.840
No added excitement required...

32:35.240 --> 32:36.680
I want it to happen again.

32:41.440 --> 32:42.520
Your turn.

32:42.600 --> 32:43.920
[Tom sighs]

32:49.880 --> 32:50.800
Well...

32:54.800 --> 32:56.720
I can't stop thinking about you.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.160
Wow.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.200
Short and sweet.

33:04.280 --> 33:05.320
[chuckles]

33:12.520 --> 33:13.880
Where the fuck have you been?

33:16.360 --> 33:17.480
Uh... [chuckles]

33:18.920 --> 33:21.400
[breathes deeply]

33:24.000 --> 33:25.320
When we can...

33:26.520 --> 33:27.920
let's make it happen.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.600
[cell phone rings]

33:29.680 --> 33:30.680
Sorry.

33:31.480 --> 33:32.800
Oh. Yeah, guess who.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.000
Hey, Ellen.

33:35.520 --> 33:38.640
No, I'm leaving now. I'll be home soon.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.680
All right, darling. Bye.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.719
[sighs]

34:51.159 --> 34:52.199
[Rachel]  Tom.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.000
Tom.

34:56.880 --> 34:57.720
Please.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.160
There's something I have to tell you.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.520
Must tell you...

35:08.880 --> 35:10.000
Tom.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.400
[cell phone vibrating]

35:32.120 --> 35:32.960
Hey.

35:33.040 --> 35:37.200
[Tom]  Pete, that bloke Jenny went to see,
that Bobby bloke...

35:37.280 --> 35:38.200
What about him?

35:40.680 --> 35:42.720
He used to be Rachel's boyfriend.

35:54.560 --> 35:55.600
[sighs]

35:58.960 --> 36:01.760
And in case you were wondering
if this is the right place...

36:02.600 --> 36:03.680
Yeah.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.320
He's a tosser.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.200
You okay?

36:13.680 --> 36:14.520
[exhales]

36:15.080 --> 36:15.960
No.

36:17.360 --> 36:19.400
I spent my day finding out...

36:19.960 --> 36:22.880
I know next to nothing
about my wife and children.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.920
[intercom beeps]

36:27.000 --> 36:27.880
[Bobby]  Yeah?

36:27.960 --> 36:30.560
[Tom]  I'm the father of that girl
you didn't recognize.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.520
Remember me? Gonna let me in?

36:36.880 --> 36:39.840
I showed you this photo of Jenny,
and you're...

36:40.600 --> 36:41.880
"I'm sorry, no...

36:43.440 --> 36:45.000
-Never seen her."
-Listen to me.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.560
You and Rachel were boyfriend
and girlfriend at school.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.520
I know. Okay? 'Cause this...

36:51.080 --> 36:54.400
This is the spitting image of Rachel
when you knew her.

36:55.160 --> 36:56.720
When I first met her, too.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.080
People say it all the time.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.880
I see it all the time.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.360
Anyone can. But not you.

37:05.680 --> 37:08.160
You go to the guy
who says he's her father,

37:08.240 --> 37:11.240
"Sorry, no, never seen her."

37:11.720 --> 37:13.080
Now, why's that?

37:15.240 --> 37:16.600
Why's that?

37:18.960 --> 37:20.040
Why?

37:22.760 --> 37:23.800
What's this?

37:23.880 --> 37:25.160
Take a look.

37:40.600 --> 37:41.960
It was two nights ago.

37:42.040 --> 37:44.640
I wasn't there when she visited.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.080
But I was told that this girl had come.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.240
And when I had a look
at the CCTV footage...

37:50.920 --> 37:51.920
Yeah.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.440
I was shocked by how much
she looked like her mother.

37:56.240 --> 37:59.080
[exhales] It bloody knocked me
sideways 'cause...

38:00.680 --> 38:02.680
You won't understand this...

38:05.200 --> 38:07.240
but I never got over Rachel.

38:07.720 --> 38:08.840
Never.

38:09.480 --> 38:10.880
Never, never, never.

38:10.960 --> 38:11.840
Never.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.880
And I know I was young,
but she was the love of my life.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.920
And you...

38:20.040 --> 38:21.240
Fuck. [chuckles]

38:22.480 --> 38:24.520
You're the luckiest man alive.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.800
To have spent all that time with her.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.720
You had years.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.600
You had kids with her.

38:31.440 --> 38:32.960
You had a life together.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.440
I was with her so long ago.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.480
Too long ago.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.080
And when I see this...

38:43.760 --> 38:45.880
[chuckles] it's...

38:47.080 --> 38:49.440
It's like looking back in time.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.840
It's like seeing Rachel...

38:55.680 --> 38:57.360
coming to find me again.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.800
And I can't cope with that.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.960
Why look at the CCTV footage?

39:12.640 --> 39:13.600
Yeah, right?

39:14.600 --> 39:18.160
You look at the footage every time
someone asks for you?

39:18.240 --> 39:19.440
I don't think so.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.520
She left a note.

39:37.360 --> 39:38.240
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.640
I didn't know what it meant,
so I didn't know what to say.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.360
-So, you have seen her?
-No.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.840
She left the note,
but she never came back.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.840
And I've no idea who Jasmine is.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.000
Keep it, please.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.480
[sighs] I'm sorry, but that's all I know.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.480
[Pete] It doesn't have to be a name.

40:12.560 --> 40:14.360
[Tom] What? It's the flower?

40:14.840 --> 40:17.400
Maybe there was someone
in their year called Jasmine.

40:18.080 --> 40:21.080
What about that restaurant
we used to go to, that Indian?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.960
That was ten, fifteen years ago.

40:25.720 --> 40:26.920
It's a barber's now.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.760
Well, I'm gonna look online.
Maybe it's moved.

40:30.440 --> 40:35.120
[sighs] No Jasmine.
But here, Rachel and Bobby.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.920
[scoffs] God.

40:40.040 --> 40:40.880
[Pete] Hang on.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.400
What?

40:42.480 --> 40:45.760
Rachel's car.
You're keeping it for Jenny, right?

40:46.480 --> 40:47.360
Right.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.240
So, did Rachel have a satnav?

40:52.040 --> 40:53.600
Try "recent destinations."

40:54.400 --> 40:55.880
Or "favorites."

41:00.520 --> 41:03.920
[Tom] No, nothing on Jasmine.

41:14.680 --> 41:17.120
Or, of course, the door side pocket.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.440
Car park ticket.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.400
Jasmine Hall.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.920
Where is that? What's the postcode?

41:26.840 --> 41:28.320
Been there a few times.

41:30.640 --> 41:33.600
Do not answer the door
or the phone to anyone, okay?

41:33.680 --> 41:34.640
Yeah.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.200
Except us.

41:51.200 --> 41:52.040
[Josh] Jenny!

42:20.800 --> 42:22.040
[doorbell rings]

42:29.120 --> 42:30.120
What's happened?

42:31.800 --> 42:34.040
This boy's image that was
on the memory stick in Zoe's locker

42:34.120 --> 42:35.600
was pulled from the Internet.

42:35.680 --> 42:39.080
It's from a photo from an art exhibition
in Santa Barbara six years ago.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.760
The photo itself was taken 20 years ago
in Brazil.

42:43.880 --> 42:47.520
Right, it's after midnight,
and that shouldn't leave the office.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.840
Right. Yeah, sorry.

42:50.920 --> 42:52.560
-It's a copy.
-Even so.

42:54.120 --> 42:55.680
Look... All right, come in.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.400
And well done.

43:03.240 --> 43:04.120
[Josh sighs]

43:27.880 --> 43:29.440
-[Sia] Have you got it?
-[Jojo] Yeah.

43:29.520 --> 43:31.800
Okay. Get it nearer.
Can you get it nearer? That's it.

43:33.240 --> 43:34.360
[both grunting]

43:34.440 --> 43:36.000
[Jojo] Just lift it a bit on your side.

43:38.600 --> 43:40.480
-[Sia] Right, okay.
-[Jojo] You ready?

43:40.560 --> 43:41.560
[Sia] Let him go.

43:41.640 --> 43:42.920
-[Jojo yells] No, hang on a--
-Dad!

43:44.280 --> 43:45.200
Dad!

43:46.480 --> 43:49.520
The problem is, yeah,
someone's put photos in Zoe's locker.

43:49.600 --> 43:50.640
Yeah, not just of the boy.

43:50.720 --> 43:52.360
What about the ones of Zoe?
Where'd they come from?

43:52.440 --> 43:55.080
From some, so-called
private cloud account?

43:55.160 --> 43:56.760
And if so, who's stealing them?

43:56.840 --> 44:00.600
And how did they end up in the locker?
'Cause everyone says there's only one key.

44:01.240 --> 44:03.080
So, who has access to it?

44:03.160 --> 44:04.000
Zoe.

44:04.560 --> 44:07.400
The husband, Neil,
and the kids, the daughter.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.800
The son, who's just gone AWOL.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.880
I mean, why has he gone AWOL?

44:16.280 --> 44:18.560
[Chris over recording]
It's Chris. Leave me a message.

44:19.840 --> 44:22.400
Call me back. I'm worried about you.
