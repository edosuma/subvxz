<i>My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.660 --> 00:07.195
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.263 --> 00:09.631
<i>When you're burned, you've got nothing...</i>

00:09.699 --> 00:12.300
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

00:12.368 --> 00:14.669
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.737 --> 00:16.705
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.772 --> 00:19.941
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

00:20.009 --> 00:22.577
<i>You rely on anyone who's
still talking to you.</i>

00:22.645 --> 00:24.179
<i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.246 --> 00:25.814
Should we shoot them?

00:25.881 --> 00:28.383
<i>... An old friend who used to
inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.451 --> 00:30.785
You know spies... a bunch
of bitchy little girls.

00:30.853 --> 00:33.321
<i>- Family, too...
- Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.389 --> 00:35.490
<i>- If you're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.558 --> 00:37.993
<i>Bottom line... as long as you're burned,</i>

00:38.060 --> 00:39.661
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:53.676 --> 00:56.678
Mike, I'm telling you, don't do it.

00:56.746 --> 00:58.179
What? You don't like the belt?

00:58.247 --> 01:00.215
I'm not kidding around here.
You got to put a kibosh on this.

01:00.282 --> 01:01.816
Sam, we talked about this.

01:01.884 --> 01:04.218
Well, maybe we didn't
talk about it enough.

01:04.286 --> 01:06.454
You're working for the same sons
of bitches that burned you, Mike,

01:06.522 --> 01:08.056
and now you're gonna
meet with this Vince guy.

01:08.124 --> 01:10.225
- Vaughn.
- Vaughn... good name for a vampire.

01:10.292 --> 01:12.627
I'm just saying, I don't
think you thought this through.

01:12.695 --> 01:14.062
I don't love working with him,

01:14.130 --> 01:15.530
but what we're doing is important.

01:15.598 --> 01:17.265
Why, 'cause Simon got out?

01:17.333 --> 01:19.000
Okay, he was a bad guy.

01:19.068 --> 01:20.869
<i>Okay, a very bad guy.</i>

01:20.936 --> 01:23.571
But he's stuck in a dungeon
somewhere. Problem solved.

01:23.639 --> 01:25.674
If it was just about Simon, maybe,

01:25.741 --> 01:28.610
but the guy who helped him
escape has bigger plans.

01:28.678 --> 01:30.679
I know you feel this is on your shoulders,

01:30.746 --> 01:32.614
but it's not your job to solve everything.

01:32.682 --> 01:33.982
Just walk away.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.251
I got an innocent man
burned for looking into this.

01:36.318 --> 01:37.686
If I stop now,

01:37.753 --> 01:40.655
I'll have ruined Jesse
Porter's life for nothing.

01:40.723 --> 01:41.690
Okay, fine.

01:43.693 --> 01:46.594
But I still think
Vaughn is a vampire name.

01:56.739 --> 01:58.239
Hey, pal.

01:58.307 --> 02:00.909
You're looking well.

02:00.976 --> 02:03.311
Miami sunshine is working wonders for you.

02:03.379 --> 02:06.448
Well, I get a little pasty when
my pals lock me in a secret prison.

02:10.352 --> 02:12.187
So, how's our project coming?

02:12.254 --> 02:15.123
Slowly. I've been looking
through Jesse Porter's files.

02:15.191 --> 02:17.492
It's a few thousand
pages of raw intelligence.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.594
Yeah.

02:19.662 --> 02:21.863
We should talk about Jesse Porter.

02:21.931 --> 02:23.531
What about him?

02:23.599 --> 02:25.366
FBI picked him up, then released him.

02:25.434 --> 02:27.168
They decided it was better to let him go

02:27.236 --> 02:28.436
and keep the incident quiet.

02:28.504 --> 02:30.138
He's been laying low,

02:30.206 --> 02:31.673
making calls to people
around the government

02:31.741 --> 02:35.043
to figure out who stole his files.

02:36.145 --> 02:38.747
He's looking for who burned him.

02:38.814 --> 02:41.049
Don't worry.

02:41.117 --> 02:42.751
We're gonna have him taken care of.

02:42.818 --> 02:43.918
Taken care of?

02:43.986 --> 02:45.587
Look, it's nothing lethal.

02:45.654 --> 02:47.689
We're just gonna find
him and put him on a plane

02:47.757 --> 02:49.557
to a nice, remote holding facility.

02:49.625 --> 02:50.892
Vaughn, that's a mistake.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.061
It's more efficient to
use him as a resource.

02:53.129 --> 02:56.331
So, you sure you're not feeling
sentimental just 'cause you burned him?

02:56.398 --> 02:58.366
No, everything we need
is inside Jesse's head.

02:58.434 --> 03:00.135
You put me in charge of the investigation.

03:00.202 --> 03:02.036
Let me handle Jesse.

03:06.142 --> 03:06.975
Phone records.

03:09.645 --> 03:12.680
Allied financial services?

03:12.748 --> 03:14.482
Yeah, Jesse hacked their PBX switch.

03:14.550 --> 03:16.818
He's using it to make his calls.

03:18.621 --> 03:20.355
Bug it, boss.

03:21.991 --> 03:23.792
That should set you on
the way to locating him.

03:26.061 --> 03:27.996
Just curious... have you thought at all

03:28.063 --> 03:30.765
about what you're gonna say
to Jesse when you find him?

03:30.833 --> 03:33.868
"Hi. I'm Michael. I destroyed your life."

03:33.936 --> 03:36.471
I'll try to avoid that subject.

03:36.539 --> 03:41.209
Has it occurred to you that
avoiding Jesse might be a good idea?

03:41.277 --> 03:43.211
You've toyed with him enough.

03:43.279 --> 03:45.814
I'll do everything I can to help him, Fi.

03:45.881 --> 03:47.649
First I got to find him.

03:48.884 --> 03:52.987
Well, I guess a little Sunday
break-in never hurt anyone.

04:08.270 --> 04:11.206
We got 90 seconds.

04:11.273 --> 04:13.174
You'd be surprised what
I can do in 90 seconds.

04:14.109 --> 04:16.611
<i>Housed in office utility rooms,</i>

04:16.678 --> 04:19.480
<i>a PBX is the phone switchboard
for a whole company.</i>

04:19.548 --> 04:21.382
<i>Using a router with upgraded firmware,</i>

04:21.450 --> 04:23.952
<i>pros can hack them to
make untraceable calls</i>

04:24.019 --> 04:25.587
<i>from the comfort of their own homes.</i>

04:25.654 --> 04:27.755
<i>It's how spies get free long-distance.</i>

04:27.823 --> 04:30.458
<i>Identifying the right line to bug on a PBX</i>

04:30.526 --> 04:32.994
<i>is as simple as matching
call times from your records</i>

04:33.062 --> 04:34.462
<i>to those in the computer.</i>

04:34.530 --> 04:36.264
<i>Of course, if you have to comb</i>

04:36.332 --> 04:37.999
<i>through thousands of phone calls,</i>

04:38.067 --> 04:40.168
<i>it's easier said than done.</i>

04:40.236 --> 04:43.204
<i>Everyone knows spies are good
with languages and firearms,</i>

04:43.272 --> 04:45.974
<i>but they need to be
great storytellers, too.</i>

04:46.041 --> 04:47.976
<i>If you can't keep a break-in secret,</i>

04:48.043 --> 04:50.445
<i>you have to get creative
to cover your tracks.</i>

04:50.512 --> 04:52.780
<i>If a company's just
laid off half its staff,</i>

04:52.848 --> 04:54.382
<i>no one asks many questions</i>

04:54.450 --> 04:56.684
<i>when it looks like an ex-employee</i>

04:56.752 --> 04:58.152
<i>broke in to make a mess.</i>

04:58.220 --> 04:59.454
Taking your sweet time, Michael.

04:59.521 --> 05:01.055
You need to buy us some more time, Fi.

05:08.931 --> 05:10.565
That's our cue to leave, Michael.

05:19.308 --> 05:21.276
What took you so long?

05:23.078 --> 05:24.913
I thought you were gonna buy us more time.

05:24.980 --> 05:26.581
I knew you were gonna say that.

05:33.689 --> 05:35.723
- How was that?
- Very good.

05:35.791 --> 05:37.025
Mm-hmm.

05:54.871 --> 05:56.005
Mom!

05:56.072 --> 05:57.706
Whoa!

05:57.774 --> 05:59.108
Jesus.

05:59.176 --> 06:02.011
Okay, we both get a text...

06:02.078 --> 06:03.345
- "Need help now."
- "Need help now."

06:03.413 --> 06:04.880
And you don't answer your phone?

06:04.948 --> 06:06.749
We thought you were under siege.

06:06.817 --> 06:09.251
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not
up on texting etiquette.

06:09.319 --> 06:11.086
I'm... I'm converting
the garage to a rental,

06:11.154 --> 06:13.022
and I thought you boys could lend a hand.

06:13.089 --> 06:14.423
You're taking on a renter?

06:14.491 --> 06:16.826
I am.

06:16.893 --> 06:18.727
I already have him lined up.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.163
He has a cat, and he's very nice.

06:21.231 --> 06:22.565
Do you think this is a good idea?

06:22.632 --> 06:26.802
I do. I could use the extra
money and a little company.

06:26.870 --> 06:29.672
Uh, mom, we use the
garage for work, for, um...

06:29.739 --> 06:31.273
- Private...
- Private work.

06:31.341 --> 06:33.275
You mean building bombs
and interrogating people?

06:33.343 --> 06:35.110
When you were on vacation
in prison, Michael,

06:35.178 --> 06:36.412
I realized something.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.781
I could use more stable people in my life,

06:38.849 --> 06:41.150
not people who sleep with
guns under their pillows.

06:41.218 --> 06:44.086
All right, mom. What do you need done?

06:44.154 --> 06:46.789
I promised I'd tile the
garage before he moves in.

06:46.857 --> 06:48.691
You know, I'm a little hurt, Maddy.

06:48.758 --> 06:51.160
You never spruced the
place up when I was here.

06:51.228 --> 06:52.494
<i>That's because he's a paying renter, Sam,</i>

06:52.562 --> 06:55.798
not someone who detonates
explosives in my solarium.

07:01.905 --> 07:06.475
You know, Mike, some guys listen to
a thing called music while they work.

07:06.543 --> 07:10.412
It's sort of like talking, only
with, you know, instruments.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.147
Well, that tap on Jesse's phone line

07:12.215 --> 07:13.482
is our only lead on his location.

07:13.550 --> 07:16.952
Let the static soothe you.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.421
So, this, uh, Jesse...

07:19.489 --> 07:22.091
He was in counterintelligence, eh?

07:22.158 --> 07:23.492
And?

07:23.560 --> 07:25.294
Well, I was just thinking, you know,

07:25.362 --> 07:27.296
these are the guys who interrogate spies.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.765
Their job is seeing through
people like you... like us.

07:29.833 --> 07:33.269
I know it's risky, Sam, but
right now it's the only way...

07:33.336 --> 07:34.670
<i>Hey, it's Jesse Porter.</i>

07:34.738 --> 07:35.905
<i>You shouldn't call me at home.</i>

07:35.972 --> 07:37.339
<i>You're radioactive.</i>

07:37.407 --> 07:39.341
<i>I get caught talking to
you, I lose my pension.</i>

07:39.409 --> 07:40.843
<i>Look, I'm not dirty. Somebody set me up.</i>

07:40.911 --> 07:42.778
<i>- You got to believe me, Freddy...
- I know.</i>

07:42.846 --> 07:44.713
<i>I made a few calls, got my hands
on something you need to see.</i>

07:44.781 --> 07:46.482
<i>Okay, well, what is it? Do you know who...</i>

07:46.549 --> 07:48.918
<i>This line's not secure. We
need to meet in person... today.</i>

07:48.985 --> 07:50.753
<i>All right, the park near my place...</i>

07:50.820 --> 07:52.121
<i>Ocean and Lexington...4:00.</i>

07:52.188 --> 07:55.524
Well, sounds like Jesse might have
a lead on the person who burned him.

07:55.592 --> 07:57.993
Look on the bright side. We have
his location. I'm calling Fi.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.461
Okay, for the record,

07:59.529 --> 08:01.697
I already hate everything about this.

08:06.369 --> 08:08.037
How's it looking, Sam?

08:08.104 --> 08:12.608
Same as an hour ago... all
quiet on the Western front.

08:12.676 --> 08:15.044
Mike, I'm projectile sweating down here.

08:15.111 --> 08:17.112
I'm turning my new
Hawaiian into a dishrag,

08:17.180 --> 08:19.815
and, you know, we're talking
about a poly-silk blend here...

08:19.883 --> 08:21.684
Dry-clean only, and it's ruined.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.053
Okay, Sam. You can bill me.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.888
Damn straight.

08:25.956 --> 08:28.057
You know, I feel for Jesse,

08:28.124 --> 08:29.625
alone, hauled out,

08:29.693 --> 08:32.193
sealed off like toxic waste.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.462
I do too, Fi.

08:33.530 --> 08:35.331
Trust me, I know what he's going through.

08:35.398 --> 08:38.267
Except Jesse didn't wake up next to
someone who had his back, like you did.

08:38.335 --> 08:40.635
As I recall, I woke up
because somebody kicked me.

08:40.703 --> 08:43.072
The point is you have a team.

08:43.139 --> 08:45.674
That team may include a
washed-up, old boozehound.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.309
You're on speaker, Fi.

08:47.377 --> 08:49.411
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, whatever.

08:49.479 --> 08:50.679
Here comes Jesse.

08:54.017 --> 08:55.851
Ooh, he is a strapping fellow, isn't he?

09:03.226 --> 09:05.761
<i>Hey, Fred. Oh, and that
must be Jesse's mystery date.</i>

09:05.829 --> 09:07.429
<i>Thanks for coming, man.</i>

09:19.042 --> 09:22.344
Got two S.U.Vs, blacked-out windows.

09:22.412 --> 09:25.347
Something tells me they're not
with the neighborhood watch.

09:25.415 --> 09:26.448
How you been? You okay?

09:26.516 --> 09:27.816
Jesse, I'm sorry.

09:27.884 --> 09:30.352
What are you gonna do, right?

09:32.322 --> 09:35.991
Okay, that's a trap.
Mikey, this is not good.

09:36.059 --> 09:38.427
They're gonna have him hemmed
in. We got to warn Jesse.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.928
We can't let him see us.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.997
- If he knows we're watching him...
- Here.

09:42.065 --> 09:44.500
We can't sit on our hands
while he gets ambushed.

09:44.567 --> 09:45.801
He won't. He can get away.

09:45.869 --> 09:48.570
Just hang on, Fi. Fi, hang on.

09:48.638 --> 09:50.672
<i>He made me call you.</i>

09:50.740 --> 09:52.775
What the hell are you talking
about, Freddy? Who? Who made you?

09:52.842 --> 09:55.144
He had pictures of me,
threatened to go to my wife.

09:55.211 --> 09:57.579
I'm retired. My marriage
is all I got left.

09:57.647 --> 09:59.548
Freddy, what the hell are you
talking about? What'd you do?

10:00.917 --> 10:04.420
Sam, the bike locked to
the pole behind you...

10:04.487 --> 10:06.055
Pull the chain off the gears.

10:09.392 --> 10:11.660
Okay, Mike, tell me what
you got, and make it snappy.

10:11.728 --> 10:14.696
You think that old arm of
yours can hit the power lines?

10:14.764 --> 10:16.799
Are you kidding?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.834
This bazooka took Annalee high

10:18.902 --> 10:20.936
to the Michigan state quarterfinals.

10:21.004 --> 10:22.304
Ha!

10:22.372 --> 10:25.207
<i>Wrap a metal chain around two power lines,</i>

10:25.275 --> 10:28.243
<i>and you complete a very
powerful electrical circuit.</i>

10:28.311 --> 10:30.345
<i>It can get you arrested,</i>

10:30.413 --> 10:33.115
<i>but it's a good way to
make a ruckus in a pinch.</i>

10:37.587 --> 10:39.021
Go, go, go!

10:39.089 --> 10:40.222
You sold me out to Khan.

10:40.290 --> 10:42.891
I didn't have a choice.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.211
You're lucky this guy can handle himself.

11:02.278 --> 11:04.580
Well, he's lucky they
had tasers, not guns.

11:04.647 --> 11:06.982
I guess we're not the only
ones looking for Jesse.

11:07.050 --> 11:08.217
We better find him first, Michael.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.226
I drove around his neighborhood for hours.

11:17.293 --> 11:18.894
He didn't come back.

11:18.962 --> 11:20.829
Cops found a body a mile from the park.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.631
Jesse's contact?

11:22.699 --> 11:24.399
Well, I guess he wasn't
worth much after the setup.

11:24.467 --> 11:26.368
So, who the hell were the guys in
the S.U.Vs?

11:26.436 --> 11:27.669
I don't know.

11:28.838 --> 11:30.072
Give me good news.

11:30.140 --> 11:31.940
- You find Jesse?
- I did...

11:32.008 --> 11:33.542
About a minute before he was ambushed

11:33.610 --> 11:35.043
by some amateur extraction team.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.179
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no. I asked for good news.</i>

11:37.247 --> 11:38.680
Jesse got away.

11:38.748 --> 11:40.482
Do you know if he has
any old enemies in town?

11:40.550 --> 11:41.717
What am I, Jesse's biographer?

11:41.784 --> 11:42.951
<i>I'm calling you for information.</i>

11:43.019 --> 11:45.320
I need you to use some of your resources.

11:45.388 --> 11:47.156
<i>Find out... you're my resource on this.</i>

11:47.223 --> 11:49.191
You wanted to handle this? Handle it.

11:54.430 --> 11:56.765
<i>Like engineers and wedding planners,</i>

11:56.833 --> 11:58.467
<i>spies obsess over details.</i>

11:58.535 --> 12:01.436
<i>If you always keep a lock
with the logo facing in</i>

12:01.504 --> 12:03.672
<i>and suddenly you find it turned out,</i>

12:03.740 --> 12:06.208
<i>you've got a problem.</i>

12:06.276 --> 12:08.477
<i>When you know someone's
about to get the drop on you,</i>

12:08.545 --> 12:10.479
<i>you can play it safe and walk away,</i>

12:10.547 --> 12:12.481
<i>or you can pretend nothing's wrong,</i>

12:12.549 --> 12:14.983
<i>go about your business,
and get the drop on them.</i>

12:25.628 --> 12:28.797
Nightclub's closed on Mondays,

12:28.865 --> 12:30.899
but I'm guessing you're
not here to salsa dance.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.335
You must be Michael Westen.
I heard you were good.

12:33.403 --> 12:36.038
Right now I'm just a guy pointing
a gun at your head. Who are you?

12:36.105 --> 12:37.472
My name is Jesse Porter.

12:37.540 --> 12:40.108
I've got a problem that
only you can understand.

12:40.176 --> 12:43.345
And, uh, I need your help.

12:53.710 --> 12:57.079
It's like meeting a
character out of a book...

12:57.147 --> 12:59.548
Michael Westen, the burned spy.

12:59.616 --> 13:01.817
People still talk, you know.

13:01.885 --> 13:04.553
There's the he-was-done-wrong folks,

13:04.621 --> 13:06.489
and then there's the
they-should've-shot-him folks.

13:06.556 --> 13:07.890
Which side were you on?

13:09.326 --> 13:11.894
Never mind. What brings you here?

13:11.962 --> 13:13.462
I was counterintelligence.

13:13.530 --> 13:15.998
Someone stole my files. I
got blamed for the breach.

13:16.066 --> 13:17.600
Eight years...

13:17.667 --> 13:19.969
Eight years, they just booted
me out like it was nothing.

13:20.036 --> 13:21.103
I'm sorry.

13:21.171 --> 13:23.472
For what it's worth, I know how you feel.

13:23.540 --> 13:26.342
Yeah, well... that's actually
not my biggest problem right now.

13:26.409 --> 13:28.644
I got an old enemy coming after me.

13:28.712 --> 13:30.279
I figured you must have a
friend in the government.

13:30.347 --> 13:32.314
I mean, how else could you
have survived this long?

13:32.382 --> 13:34.216
- I just need to talk to someone.
- I have friends, but not in the government.

13:34.284 --> 13:35.484
Your name doesn't even need to come up.

13:35.552 --> 13:36.719
- I... I just... I...
- I can't help you there.

13:38.855 --> 13:39.855
All right.

13:39.923 --> 13:43.559
Thanks for the yogurt.

13:43.627 --> 13:45.895
This old enemy... does he have a name?

13:45.962 --> 13:48.397
Yeah, Ming Khan.

13:48.465 --> 13:50.432
Son of a bitch thinks I stole
2 million bucks from him.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.434
Maybe I could help you there.

13:52.502 --> 13:54.703
No, man, look, he's... you don't know him.

13:54.771 --> 13:56.438
He's dangerous. He's connected.

13:56.506 --> 13:58.741
I said I had friends.

13:58.809 --> 14:00.209
Let me see what I can do for you.

14:03.713 --> 14:05.114
Why would you do that?

14:05.182 --> 14:08.784
Part of me thinks that burned
spies need to stick together.

14:08.852 --> 14:11.720
Yeah? What about the other part?

14:11.788 --> 14:15.157
The other part thinks if a
counterintel op owed me a favor

14:15.225 --> 14:18.227
and got back in someday, he
could put in a good word for me.

14:21.031 --> 14:22.298
All right, man.

14:22.365 --> 14:24.300
You got a deal.

14:29.272 --> 14:31.207
You know of any good motels, man?

14:31.274 --> 14:33.242
I, uh... I can't go back to my place.

14:33.310 --> 14:35.010
Uh, you can't go to a motel right now.

14:35.078 --> 14:36.879
- That's exactly where Khan will be looking for you.
- Yeah.

14:36.947 --> 14:38.214
We'll figure something out.

14:38.281 --> 14:39.582
So I'm in charge of keeping secrets

14:39.649 --> 14:40.883
from a counterintelligence agent?

14:40.951 --> 14:43.886
He's crashing in a vacant condo next door.

14:43.954 --> 14:45.788
It's not like he's staying
in your living room.

14:45.856 --> 14:47.423
<i>But he is using my duvet.</i>

14:47.490 --> 14:49.925
If another one of your
strays ruins my linens,

14:49.993 --> 14:51.093
I will kill you.

14:51.161 --> 14:54.797
You said yourself Jesse needs
someone to watch his back.

14:54.865 --> 14:58.100
That is not fair using
that argument against me.

15:02.873 --> 15:04.340
Fine.

15:04.407 --> 15:07.076
There are worse things than having
a very cute next-door neighbor.

15:10.213 --> 15:13.048
In exchange for this downy-soft bedding,

15:13.116 --> 15:15.451
you've got to tell us all
about this Khan person.

15:15.518 --> 15:19.521
Oh, um...

15:19.589 --> 15:22.424
M... most of it's classified,
so I... I can't really...

15:22.492 --> 15:24.393
Let's be clear.

15:24.461 --> 15:25.794
Michael is the spy.

15:25.862 --> 15:28.397
He cares about words like "classified."

15:28.465 --> 15:30.132
I, on the other hand, only care

15:30.200 --> 15:31.767
about who it is I'm
supposed to be fighting.

15:31.835 --> 15:33.402
Okay.

15:33.470 --> 15:36.538
Khan was a hotshot in Asian drug shipping,

15:36.606 --> 15:38.173
got in some trouble with
the local authorities,

15:38.241 --> 15:39.608
came running to uncle Sam to cut a deal.

15:39.676 --> 15:40.876
He's a snitch, basically.

15:40.944 --> 15:42.578
He's trading Intel on his terrorist pals

15:42.646 --> 15:44.580
- for a life in America.
- You were his handler.

15:44.648 --> 15:46.515
Yeah, got the job of debriefing him,

15:46.583 --> 15:48.250
moving his money to U.S. banks.

15:48.318 --> 15:50.152
First part went fine.
Money never showed up.

15:50.220 --> 15:52.254
The Chinese got it in transit. Poof.

15:52.322 --> 15:54.323
And he blames you for
stealing his nest egg.

15:54.391 --> 15:57.526
Yeah, not to be crass, but have
you considered shooting him?

15:57.594 --> 16:00.462
I'd be all for it, but Khan's
got some powerful friends.

16:00.530 --> 16:02.498
If I take a shot at him,
they'll come after me next.

16:02.565 --> 16:04.466
That's why I wanted to find someone
in the government to shut it down.

16:04.534 --> 16:06.068
Yeah, that's not gonna happen,

16:06.136 --> 16:08.304
but we may be able to
do the next best thing.

16:08.371 --> 16:10.139
You know, if we can get
him busted by the cops,

16:10.206 --> 16:11.640
his friends will keep their distance.

16:11.708 --> 16:13.275
Illegal-weapons charges might do it.

16:13.343 --> 16:15.411
It'll be tough, but if
we keep it really heavy...

16:15.478 --> 16:17.546
- 25mm, maybe an RPG...
- RPG.

16:17.614 --> 16:19.081
RPG? Right.

16:22.152 --> 16:24.053
Oh, you're serious?

16:24.120 --> 16:26.188
So... so you have, like, a magic way

16:26.256 --> 16:27.690
of... of setting him up for this?

16:27.757 --> 16:29.425
No magic... we get him to buy the weapons.

16:29.492 --> 16:30.693
We get him arrested.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.861
You're gonna walk up to the
guy, start talking to him?

16:32.929 --> 16:35.431
I'm a spy, Jesse. That's what we do.

16:35.498 --> 16:36.966
Have things changed since I've been out?

16:37.033 --> 16:38.901
Uh, Khan is a psycho, just so you know.

16:38.969 --> 16:41.036
I seriously doubt y'all
have mutual friends.

16:41.104 --> 16:43.072
A mutual enemy will do fine.

16:53.183 --> 16:54.450
Hey, there, uh, can I talk to your boss?

16:54.517 --> 16:55.884
- Get the hell...
- Ugh!

16:55.952 --> 16:58.120
<i>Quick and excruciating,</i>

16:58.188 --> 17:00.322
<i>few holds are more effective
than a simple thumb lock.</i>

17:00.390 --> 17:01.824
<i>A little pressure on the right spot...</i>

17:01.891 --> 17:03.158
<i>- Ugh!
- And your target will be learning</i>

17:03.226 --> 17:05.560
<i>how to hold a fork with a new hand.</i>

17:05.627 --> 17:08.731
He might want to ice that.

17:08.798 --> 17:10.799
Hey, we need to talk.

17:10.867 --> 17:12.367
And who might you be?

17:14.570 --> 17:16.137
The name's Turner.

17:16.205 --> 17:18.540
We have a mutual
acquaintance, Jesse Porter.

17:18.608 --> 17:21.276
Jesse Porter? Doesn't ring a bell.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.478
Does it, Mr. Lei?

17:24.347 --> 17:25.580
So it was someone else who ran

17:25.647 --> 17:27.950
that half-assed
snatch-and-grab yesterday?

17:28.018 --> 17:30.452
You know, I was this close to laying
my hands on that son of a bitch,

17:30.520 --> 17:32.821
until you guys blew it for me.

17:32.889 --> 17:34.356
How did you find us?

17:34.424 --> 17:37.159
There's only so many groups
of guys carrying serious heat

17:37.227 --> 17:39.094
in Chinese restaurants in Key Biscayne.

17:39.162 --> 17:41.333
- So, what do you want?
- Well, I want to make a deal.

17:41.343 --> 17:43.963
Why would we make a deal
with you, Mr. Turner?

17:44.701 --> 17:46.468
Because I know where Jesse is...

17:46.536 --> 17:48.103
Unless you guys have never heard of him,

17:48.171 --> 17:51.507
and then I'll just finish up here and...

17:51.574 --> 17:53.709
Take my Mongolian beef to go.

17:53.777 --> 17:57.946
What is it that you want with, uh, Jesse?

17:58.014 --> 18:01.950
There's a certain cartel
willing to pay top dollar to me

18:02.018 --> 18:03.852
for what's in his head.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.588
I think there's a way
we can help each other.

18:06.656 --> 18:08.857
I'm listening.

18:08.925 --> 18:12.861
Your little fiasco with
Jesse sent him into hiding.

18:12.929 --> 18:14.797
He's dug in like a tick...

18:14.864 --> 18:17.466
Cement wall, claymore mine in the door.

18:17.534 --> 18:21.770
And you'll tell me where
this is on what condition?

18:21.838 --> 18:25.207
I need some heavy
artillery to extract him.

18:25.275 --> 18:28.143
I'm low on funds.

18:28.211 --> 18:30.379
I could use a few extra hands.

18:30.447 --> 18:32.714
So, when we find Jesse,

18:32.782 --> 18:35.117
we're supposed to just, what, share him?

18:37.454 --> 18:39.955
That's what we learned in kindergarten.

18:40.023 --> 18:41.890
I mean, you get what you need,

18:41.958 --> 18:44.026
and then I take him with me... win-win.

18:44.094 --> 18:46.428
We will find him on our own, thank you.

18:46.496 --> 18:49.731
We don't go on armed assaults
with randoms off the street.

18:49.799 --> 18:51.300
Okeydokey.

18:51.367 --> 18:53.035
But... good day, Mr. Turner.

18:53.103 --> 18:55.370
Can I take the Mongolian beef?

18:59.275 --> 19:01.143
I told you a sales
pitch isn't gonna do it.

19:01.211 --> 19:03.011
Khan... Khan's tempted.

19:03.079 --> 19:04.813
We just need to push
him a little bit harder.

19:04.881 --> 19:07.416
Right now, they think they
can handle you on their own.

19:07.484 --> 19:09.818
But we'll convince them
they need help... my help.

19:09.886 --> 19:11.386
How do you propose to do that?

19:11.454 --> 19:12.821
There's someone I want you to meet.

19:12.889 --> 19:14.590
Jesse, this is Sam Axe.

19:14.657 --> 19:16.792
He's a former Navy
S.E.A.L. and a friend. Hey.

19:16.860 --> 19:18.093
- Good to meet you.
- Likewise.

19:19.996 --> 19:22.631
So, Mike told me about your problem.

19:22.699 --> 19:24.566
I had a buddy pull some paperwork.

19:24.634 --> 19:27.102
Turns out Mr. Lei rents
a place on star island.

19:27.170 --> 19:28.704
So, here's what I'm thinking.

19:28.771 --> 19:30.806
Next time these guys head out for grub,

19:30.874 --> 19:33.008
we stage a mock ambush on them.

19:33.076 --> 19:35.210
Jesse, if you can position
yourself on the outside wall here,

19:35.278 --> 19:37.279
you can hose the place down
with your assault rifle,

19:37.347 --> 19:40.182
do a triangle-of-death
thing, drive them into here.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.284
When you stop
to reload, I'll swoop in,

19:42.352 --> 19:45.120
scare you off, and I become
Khan's guardian angel.

19:45.188 --> 19:47.422
Okay, let me see this.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.025
I dig it. I dig it.

19:50.093 --> 19:51.894
Just, if we're gonna do
the triangle of death,

19:51.961 --> 19:53.228
we got to do it from inside the wall,

19:53.296 --> 19:54.596
like, right here, like, in his face.

19:54.664 --> 19:56.498
There's an armed guard that
patrols the grounds, Jesse.

19:56.566 --> 19:58.534
If you get any closer than that...

19:58.601 --> 20:00.402
I'll have to deal with a
rent-a-thug all by my little self.

20:00.470 --> 20:03.539
Okay, uh, quick F.Y.I. here...

20:03.606 --> 20:05.240
Uh, we plan our missions
with the wacky idea

20:05.308 --> 20:06.775
of getting everybody out in one piece.

20:06.843 --> 20:08.610
So just sit back, relax,

20:08.678 --> 20:10.179
and let us worry about the heavy lifting.

20:19.389 --> 20:22.024
So, Mike, you think this
is gonna convince Khan

20:22.091 --> 20:24.526
to work with you, or just that
he should pack up and leave?

20:24.594 --> 20:26.228
Well, he thinks Jesse's got his money.

20:26.296 --> 20:27.763
He'll do what he has to do to get it.

20:27.830 --> 20:29.031
Just cover me when I go in.

20:29.098 --> 20:30.699
Did I mention I'm not a
fan of running a mission

20:30.767 --> 20:31.600
with a kid we barely know?

20:31.668 --> 20:33.335
10 times.

20:33.403 --> 20:35.370
I'm just saying, these
counterintel types, Mike...

20:35.438 --> 20:37.339
They're lone wolves,
they are not team players.

20:37.407 --> 20:39.208
This is Jesse's best shot
to getting Khan off his back.

20:39.275 --> 20:40.742
He'll behave.

20:40.810 --> 20:42.644
Here we go, Sam.

20:47.517 --> 20:50.385
Okay, that's where Jesse's
supposed to set up shop.

20:52.655 --> 20:54.856
And yet he's still moving.

20:54.924 --> 20:56.391
What the hell is he doing?

20:56.459 --> 21:00.495
His version of the plan. Watch my back.

21:10.974 --> 21:11.840
Hey, Khan!

21:11.908 --> 21:13.242
You looking for me?!

21:15.144 --> 21:16.178
You want your money? Come get it!

21:18.581 --> 21:21.183
<i>Like pro athletes, spies know</i>

21:21.251 --> 21:23.218
<i>that no amount of practice or planning</i>

21:23.286 --> 21:26.021
<i>simulates the adrenaline
rush of real action.</i>

21:26.089 --> 21:27.689
<i>That's why you always have to be ready</i>

21:27.757 --> 21:29.758
<i>to adjust tactics on the fly.</i>

21:29.826 --> 21:33.028
<i>If a teammate suddenly
decides to shoot at you</i>

21:33.096 --> 21:34.529
<i>to convince the bad guys you're enemies...</i>

21:39.535 --> 21:42.237
<i>You go with the flow...</i>

21:42.305 --> 21:43.905
<i>and shoot back.</i>

21:47.844 --> 21:51.179
Unbelievable. Are you guys trying to die?

21:51.247 --> 21:53.215
- Mr. Turner.
- At your service.

21:58.021 --> 22:01.256
Oh, come on, Mike, I can't
take out four jokers in one go.

22:01.324 --> 22:04.526
Is this your way of thanking
me for saving your hides?

22:04.594 --> 22:07.296
You have a bad habit of showing
up where you don't belong.

22:07.363 --> 22:09.031
Are you guys impaired?

22:09.098 --> 22:11.300
Am I talking too fast? Is that it?

22:11.367 --> 22:13.068
I mean, I'm trying to get Jesse.

22:13.136 --> 22:14.736
It doesn't take a genius to figure out

22:14.804 --> 22:17.572
that he'd try to hit your
place after you went after him.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.474
You still think you can handle Jesse?

22:22.478 --> 22:25.514
Fine, kill me.

22:25.581 --> 22:27.916
But the next time he pays you a visit,

22:27.984 --> 22:30.552
you're gonna need more than new lawn art.

22:30.620 --> 22:33.021
<i>Whether it's in the field or a showroom,</i>

22:33.089 --> 22:35.457
<i>the most powerful move at
the end of a sales pitch</i>

22:35.525 --> 22:37.559
<i>is to just walk away.</i>

22:37.627 --> 22:40.996
<i>It's an effective
technique to close a deal,</i>

22:41.064 --> 22:43.598
<i>but it can also get you shot in the back.</i>

22:43.666 --> 22:48.103
You have a flair for
the dramatic, Mr. Turner.

22:48.171 --> 22:50.672
You've made your point.

22:50.740 --> 22:54.710
Is that your way of saying you'd
like my help catching Jesse?

22:54.777 --> 22:57.713
I'll be back tomorrow
with a shopping list.

22:57.780 --> 23:00.682
Crack your piggy bank.
It's gonna cost you.

23:00.750 --> 23:03.051
Oh, and, Khan...

23:03.119 --> 23:04.586
Tell your sidekick his safety's on.

23:13.753 --> 23:14.886
Hey, hey.

23:16.322 --> 23:18.757
Oh, yeah. Sorry about the car.

23:18.825 --> 23:21.426
- Hope you'll take a personal I.O.U.?
- Good as gold.

23:21.494 --> 23:23.228
What the hell did you think
you were doing back there?

23:23.296 --> 23:25.630
Kicking ass.

23:25.698 --> 23:28.433
<i>- What? I had to get in
close to sell it. I got it done.
- No, no, we got it done.</i>

23:28.501 --> 23:29.501
You pull that lone ranger crap again,

23:29.569 --> 23:30.602
you and me are gonna dance.

23:30.670 --> 23:31.803
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:31.871 --> 23:33.638
- We're gonna dance?
- Uh-huh, we're dancing.

23:33.706 --> 23:35.240
- I will beat your old ass.
- Come on, man, pull the trigger.

23:35.308 --> 23:36.208
- Oh, you think?
- You're just an old man. Do it. Do it.

23:36.275 --> 23:37.943
Calm down. Calm down!

23:38.011 --> 23:39.578
What matters is that
I'm in with Khan and Lei.

23:39.645 --> 23:41.546
You want to finish this
when I'm done, fine.

23:41.614 --> 23:43.281
- We have work to do.
- Okay by me, Mikey.

23:43.349 --> 23:44.983
Sooner we put them on
a platter for the cops,

23:45.051 --> 23:47.019
sooner we're done with Billy the kid here.

23:47.086 --> 23:48.620
All right, so you got
the meeting with Khan.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.022
What happens if they smell a setup?

23:50.089 --> 23:51.423
We'll cross that bridge later.

23:51.491 --> 23:54.092
For now, I need them to buy enough
artillery to start World War III.

23:58.664 --> 24:00.499
I don't know
what level of experience

24:00.566 --> 24:01.933
you have with this sort of thing,

24:02.001 --> 24:03.168
but the trick with a bunker...

24:03.236 --> 24:05.937
It's not about getting in, it's
about getting the target out alive.

24:06.005 --> 24:07.706
Well, I need him alive.

24:07.774 --> 24:10.475
Right, so this is what I propose.

24:10.543 --> 24:14.513
Now, I can arrange delivery...

24:14.580 --> 24:16.915
Three Barrett rifles,
tungsten-tipped rounds?

24:16.983 --> 24:18.450
Designed to punch holes in tanks.

24:18.518 --> 24:20.385
It'll cut through that bunker
like it's made of tissue paper.

24:20.453 --> 24:22.687
A breaching ram, military-grade tear gas,

24:22.755 --> 24:23.855
and a grenade launcher?

24:23.923 --> 24:25.323
Hey, we pump in some gas,

24:25.391 --> 24:27.192
flush out Jesse like the rat he is.

24:27.260 --> 24:28.727
This is not even legal.

24:28.795 --> 24:31.029
This kind of firepower is way too risky.

24:31.097 --> 24:33.265
Too risky?

24:34.534 --> 24:37.903
You know, I spent...
15 years in special ops,

24:37.970 --> 24:40.172
interrogating, tracking,

24:40.239 --> 24:41.973
climbing into caves in Afghanistan.

24:42.041 --> 24:44.709
You ever done that?
Yeah, I didn't think so.

24:44.777 --> 24:45.944
I know what it takes to get it done.

24:47.613 --> 24:49.281
I say we find Jesse on our own,

24:49.348 --> 24:50.749
take care of him our own way.

24:50.817 --> 24:54.719
You know, your boy here
is awfully opinionated.

24:54.787 --> 24:58.890
<i>Last time I checked,
though, Jesse's hunting you.</i>

24:58.958 --> 25:00.425
He makes a point.

25:01.727 --> 25:04.029
I been hunting Agent
Porter for a long time.

25:04.097 --> 25:05.597
I know what makes him tick.

25:05.665 --> 25:07.599
I know what it takes to
get what you want from him,

25:07.667 --> 25:09.734
but I need the right tools to grab him.

25:09.802 --> 25:11.136
If you have the cash,

25:11.204 --> 25:13.939
I can get a guy who can
get everything we need.

25:14.006 --> 25:18.910
Now, I'm tired... of Mr. Lei
second-guessing everything I say.

25:18.978 --> 25:20.579
If we have a deal, you say so.

25:20.646 --> 25:23.014
Otherwise, I go my own way.

25:31.891 --> 25:34.793
Provide an account where you'd
like your money wired, Mr. Turner.

25:37.230 --> 25:39.131
We will make the arrangements.

25:40.299 --> 25:43.135
Fi, Khan went for it.
Let's get a truck ready.

25:43.202 --> 25:45.604
Make it look like I'm a guy who
moves a lot of heavy weapons.

25:45.671 --> 25:47.005
Any preference on color?

25:47.073 --> 25:48.840
I'll leave it to you, but I
need it by tomorrow morning.

25:48.908 --> 25:50.475
I got to head to my mom's.

25:50.543 --> 25:52.978
Her renter's cat found
some of my old detonators.

25:53.045 --> 25:54.846
Uh-oh. Bye-bye, tenant.

25:54.914 --> 25:56.047
Yeah, he moved out.

25:56.115 --> 25:57.916
Can you and Jesse handle the truck?

25:57.984 --> 26:00.318
I'm sure we'll be fine.

26:00.386 --> 26:04.523
<i>When using a street vehicle
to haul serious weapons,</i>

26:04.590 --> 26:06.825
<i>some modifications are in order.</i>

26:06.893 --> 26:09.661
<i>Heavy-duty coil springs
are used by dune buggies</i>

26:09.729 --> 26:11.363
<i>to race across the desert.</i>

26:11.430 --> 26:13.532
<i>Add them to your suspension system,</i>

26:13.599 --> 26:16.401
<i>and you can hit a few potholes
without snapping an axle.</i>

26:16.469 --> 26:18.870
<i>A strut brace over your engine</i>

26:18.938 --> 26:21.139
<i>stabilizes your center of gravity.</i>

26:21.207 --> 26:23.441
<i>And nothing helps with a fast getaway</i>

26:23.509 --> 26:27.712
<i>like a nitrous-oxide tank
connected to your fuel injector.</i>

26:27.780 --> 26:29.881
All righty.

26:29.949 --> 26:32.751
Think that's everything Westen
needs for his gun deal with Khan?

26:32.818 --> 26:34.753
If Michael can't make an escape in this,

26:34.820 --> 26:36.288
then he deserves to get caught.

26:37.757 --> 26:40.158
You're pretty handy with that wrench.

26:40.226 --> 26:43.228
You're pretty handy with
a gun for a desk jockey.

26:43.296 --> 26:46.498
Michael told me about your
little one-man rampage with Kahn.

26:46.566 --> 26:48.800
I actually started in the field.

26:48.868 --> 26:53.104
They stuck me in counterintel 'cause I
tended to, uh, go after all the bad guys,

26:53.172 --> 26:55.307
not just the ones they wanted me to get.

26:55.374 --> 26:57.275
It turns out some guys can watch a dude

26:57.343 --> 26:59.077
smack his girlfriend around in a bar,

26:59.145 --> 27:01.213
and some guys can't.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.415
I knew I liked you.

27:05.551 --> 27:07.052
Michael's gonna be a while.

27:07.119 --> 27:10.288
You, uh... want to take it for a spin?

27:10.356 --> 27:11.723
Hell yes.

27:15.929 --> 27:17.763
Who says Christmas
only happens once a year?

27:17.831 --> 27:20.399
Barretts are in the bag.
Here are your launchers.

27:20.467 --> 27:24.236
Turn that frown
upside-down. Are we happy?

27:24.304 --> 27:25.938
We are.

27:26.005 --> 27:28.407
The rest of your money is on its way now.

27:28.475 --> 27:30.476
- So, when do we find Jesse?
- I'm gonna take you to him.

27:30.543 --> 27:33.579
Let's mount up. Just give
me a hand with the ammo.

27:33.646 --> 27:35.114
<i>Spies know the most distrusting people</i>

27:35.181 --> 27:36.582
<i>are often the easiest to manipulate.</i>

27:36.649 --> 27:41.520
<i>If you want someone to drive around
with a trunk full of illegal weapons,</i>

27:41.588 --> 27:43.222
<i>just insist on doing it yourself.</i>

27:43.289 --> 27:44.490
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:44.557 --> 27:46.492
What the hell do you think you're doing?

27:46.559 --> 27:48.660
Um, putting the guns in.

27:48.728 --> 27:53.098
- I mean, this truck has been
specially outfitted for the weight.
- No way.

27:53.166 --> 27:55.067
You think we're gonna
spend that kind of money

27:55.135 --> 27:56.235
and just let you drive off with them?

27:56.302 --> 27:57.970
I'm not driving off with anything.

27:58.037 --> 27:59.404
I'm meeting you at the bunker.

27:59.472 --> 28:01.840
And we're just supposed
to trust you, right?

28:06.846 --> 28:08.847
We take the weapons.

28:08.915 --> 28:12.117
You know, with all due respect, Mr. Khan,

28:12.185 --> 28:14.319
are you out of your frickin' mind?

28:14.387 --> 28:16.889
You know how illegal these guns are.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.924
Your Fender's gonna be
dragging on the pavement.

28:18.992 --> 28:22.027
Some port authority stooge
is gonna call the cops.

28:22.095 --> 28:25.130
Right now, I'm more worried
about you than the cops.

28:25.198 --> 28:26.532
Suit yourself.

28:31.304 --> 28:32.237
Ugh!

28:32.305 --> 28:33.305
Lift with the knees.

28:42.582 --> 28:44.550
Yeah. Hi, police?

28:44.617 --> 28:47.052
Um, I think I just saw a drug deal.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.488
Yeah, guys with guns loading bags.

28:49.556 --> 28:51.657
Uh-huh. Hyperion road, by the port.

28:55.195 --> 28:57.129
Take the next left. Two blocks.

29:08.007 --> 29:10.075
Damn, what did I tell you?

29:13.046 --> 29:15.214
<i>If you find yourself
in a high-speed pursuit</i>

29:15.281 --> 29:18.217
<i>while driving in a caravan,</i>

29:18.284 --> 29:20.018
<i>you don't always have to
be faster than the cops.</i>

29:20.086 --> 29:22.855
<i>You just have to be faster
than the guy next to you.</i>

29:26.092 --> 29:29.928
<i>Of course, it helps if you
are faster than the cops.</i>

29:48.882 --> 29:49.781
Aah!

30:02.729 --> 30:04.763
Hands on your head! Hands on your head!

30:04.831 --> 30:06.598
Get up! Get up!

30:06.666 --> 30:08.433
Get up! Get in there!

30:08.501 --> 30:09.601
Stand up.

30:09.669 --> 30:11.937
Officer, let... let us explain.

30:12.005 --> 30:13.972
You have the right to remain silent.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.974
You worried about the cops now?

30:18.978 --> 30:21.647
Jesse, it's Michael again.

30:21.714 --> 30:23.382
Where are you? Call me back.

30:23.449 --> 30:25.217
Four messages?

30:25.285 --> 30:27.552
Don't you think you might
seem a little desperate?

30:27.620 --> 30:30.656
He took us out for a $100
thank-you dinner last night,

30:30.723 --> 30:32.691
and now he won't return my calls?

30:32.759 --> 30:33.992
Relax.

30:34.060 --> 30:36.361
All his stuff is still at the condo.

30:36.429 --> 30:39.998
I don't think Jesse's the type
to leave without saying goodbye.

30:40.066 --> 30:41.466
He's not you.

30:44.437 --> 30:45.771
It's Khan.

30:45.838 --> 30:47.472
Shouldn't he be in jail?

30:47.540 --> 30:48.874
Let's find out.

30:50.276 --> 30:53.745
Khan. Oh, I thought you got pinched.

30:53.813 --> 30:54.947
Yes.

30:55.014 --> 30:58.450
Years ago, I did a favor for the
people at the drug enforcement agency.

30:58.518 --> 30:59.985
It wasn't easy,

31:00.053 --> 31:02.988
but my lawyers persuaded
them to return that courtesy.

31:03.056 --> 31:04.890
Oh, you were sitting on a
get-out-of-jail-free card?

31:04.958 --> 31:07.092
Oh, that's beautiful.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.661
Listen, give me another day.
We'll take another run at it.

31:09.729 --> 31:11.863
Oh, that won't be necessary.

31:11.931 --> 31:15.467
You see, Jesse stuck his head
out when he thought I was gone.

31:15.535 --> 31:18.503
He was unaware I kept his
apartment under surveillance.

31:22.842 --> 31:24.676
You got Jesse?

31:24.744 --> 31:26.044
Picked him up two hours ago.

31:26.112 --> 31:28.213
We've been trying to get him to talk,

31:28.281 --> 31:30.282
but so far he has been uncooperative.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.128
You know, you said you
knew all about Jesse

31:43.196 --> 31:46.698
and the art of interrogation.

31:46.766 --> 31:49.101
Perhaps you could come talk to him.

31:49.168 --> 31:50.302
Oh, it'll be my pleasure.

31:50.370 --> 31:52.170
Yeah, you remember our deal, though.

31:52.238 --> 31:54.973
You get what you're after,
and then I get Jesse.

31:55.041 --> 31:57.509
That only works if he's in one piece.

31:57.577 --> 31:59.845
I'll try not to do any permanent damage.

32:02.882 --> 32:04.016
Aah!

32:07.372 --> 32:09.092
At least the cops have Kahn's artillery.

32:09.879 --> 32:12.280
Five of them, three of us...
it's almost a fair fight.

32:12.348 --> 32:14.149
But we can't solve this with guns, Fi.

32:14.216 --> 32:16.851
It's too easy for them to just
kill Jesse if things get hot.

32:16.919 --> 32:18.486
Well, do you have a better idea?

32:18.554 --> 32:21.956
Yeah, we need to convince
Khan to let me take Jesse.

32:22.024 --> 32:24.392
Wait, did you hit your
head during the car chase?

32:24.460 --> 32:25.660
Khan is not gonna let you take Jesse

32:25.728 --> 32:27.395
until he gets his money,

32:27.463 --> 32:29.497
- which is a problem because Jesse didn't steal it.
- I know, Fi.

32:29.565 --> 32:30.832
We're gonna have to convince him

32:30.900 --> 32:32.167
that someone else stole the money.

32:32.234 --> 32:33.868
- Someone? Who?
- Lei.

32:33.936 --> 32:35.537
Well, how are you gonna pull that off?

32:35.604 --> 32:36.771
He's Khan's closest adviser.

32:36.839 --> 32:39.207
Which means he had access and opportunity.

32:39.275 --> 32:41.109
I can sell this. You find Barry.

32:41.177 --> 32:42.777
You have him get everything he can

32:42.845 --> 32:44.879
about the account Khan
used to buy the guns.

32:44.947 --> 32:46.981
If Khan pays Lei from the same place...

32:47.049 --> 32:50.318
We can use it to get Lei's
personal bank account.

32:50.386 --> 32:53.621
But if I do get a number,

32:53.689 --> 32:55.023
how are you gonna make Jesse say it?

32:55.090 --> 32:56.891
I'm gonna bring Jesse a cheat sheet.

33:03.032 --> 33:04.165
Hey, baby.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.301
I told you on the phone I can't talk now

33:06.368 --> 33:07.468
'cause I'm in a meeting.

33:07.536 --> 33:09.537
Oh, well, uh...

33:09.605 --> 33:11.673
Meeting adjourned. Scram, honey.

33:13.209 --> 33:13.808
All right.

33:16.011 --> 33:17.645
What the hell was that?

33:17.713 --> 33:20.215
You just cost me a client,

33:20.282 --> 33:21.616
although that was smokin' hot.

33:24.186 --> 33:25.987
My business accounts.

33:26.055 --> 33:27.689
A bad man bought some guns from me.

33:27.756 --> 33:30.024
I need you to trace this wire
transfer back to the source.

33:30.092 --> 33:32.393
I need information about
the original account...

33:32.461 --> 33:34.929
Transfers, linked accounts,
names, dates, everything.

33:34.997 --> 33:37.198
Oh, so you only want the
moon. That can't be done.

33:37.266 --> 33:39.067
You're asking me to bribe bank officials.

33:39.134 --> 33:40.635
Oh, you've never bribed a bank official?

33:40.703 --> 33:42.003
Yeah, I have, when I'm
looking for new clients,

33:42.071 --> 33:43.571
but this is my business.

33:47.910 --> 33:50.044
Think I got something here, Mike.

33:50.112 --> 33:52.247
You wanted someone who could
pass for a relative of Jesse's...

33:52.314 --> 33:54.382
Kathy Porter from Dallas.

33:54.450 --> 33:56.451
She passed away five days ago.

33:56.518 --> 33:57.518
It's the right age, right complexion.

33:57.586 --> 33:59.487
Well, that is perfect, Sam.

33:59.555 --> 34:01.122
Fi, tell me you got something.

34:01.190 --> 34:03.358
Lei's personal accounts are in Antigua.

34:03.425 --> 34:05.293
Looks like Khan pays him 30 grand a month.

34:05.361 --> 34:07.161
You are a miracle worker.

34:07.229 --> 34:08.295
Yeah, I'm sending you the number now.

34:08.364 --> 34:09.429
Oh, and, Michael,

34:09.498 --> 34:10.898
Barry made me promise him dinner

34:10.966 --> 34:13.001
to hear how he can maximize
my offshore finances.

34:13.068 --> 34:15.103
- You owe me.
- Yes, I do.

34:15.170 --> 34:17.871
All right, change Kathy's
birthplace to Antigua,

34:17.940 --> 34:20.041
and we need to adjust
the online archive number.

34:20.109 --> 34:22.176
You sure you want to play
follow-the-leader with Jesse?

34:22.244 --> 34:24.312
I mean, the guy's not exactly
great at taking direction.

34:24.380 --> 34:27.014
I got him into this, Sam.
I'm gonna get him out.

34:27.081 --> 34:29.050
How's our boy?

34:29.118 --> 34:30.351
Still breathing.

34:30.418 --> 34:31.418
He won't speak, despite our encouragement.

34:31.487 --> 34:32.719
Well, what did I tell you?

34:32.788 --> 34:34.355
If you hurt him, it just
makes it that much harder

34:34.422 --> 34:35.523
to get anything useful out of him.

34:35.591 --> 34:36.824
The man stole a lot of money from me.

34:36.891 --> 34:38.860
Until I find out what happened to it,

34:38.927 --> 34:41.228
he's mine to deal with
as I please, Mr. Turner.

34:41.297 --> 34:42.730
Jesse probably spent the money years ago.

34:42.797 --> 34:44.132
We should just kill
him and be done with it,

34:44.199 --> 34:45.967
and stop doing business with strangers.

34:46.034 --> 34:47.635
Did you guys talk about
killing Jesse in front of him?

34:48.837 --> 34:49.737
In English?

34:51.139 --> 34:52.674
I thought so. There's your problem.

34:52.741 --> 34:54.375
I mean, if a man knows he's gonna die,

34:54.443 --> 34:55.710
he has no reason to speak up.

34:55.777 --> 34:57.178
And how will you motivate him...

34:57.246 --> 34:58.579
Kind words and a warm cup of tea?

34:58.647 --> 35:01.115
No, with what's inside this briefcase.

35:01.183 --> 35:03.384
<i>Few things are more dangerous</i>

35:03.452 --> 35:06.321
<i>than passing a message
in plain view of hostiles.</i>

35:06.388 --> 35:08.756
<i>To do it, you need a reason
to get close to someone.</i>

35:08.824 --> 35:10.958
<i>You don't get to be choosy about how.</i>

35:11.026 --> 35:12.760
Looks like we got a bleeder.

35:12.828 --> 35:14.529
Hello, Agent Porter.

35:17.966 --> 35:22.203
Now, Agent Porter, I know
why you haven't been talking.

35:22.271 --> 35:28.376
You think you'll be killed if
you admit you stole Khan's money.

35:28.444 --> 35:30.478
You need to understand something.

35:30.546 --> 35:34.282
Your life is not the only
thing that is on the line.

35:35.718 --> 35:39.120
This is an obituary of one Kathy Porter,

35:39.188 --> 35:42.690
killed five days ago in a home invasion.

35:42.758 --> 35:43.891
Can you see the resemblance?

35:46.495 --> 35:48.329
- Wait, wait. What?
- For what it's worth,

35:48.397 --> 35:50.231
she had some nice things
to say about you in the end.

35:50.299 --> 35:52.400
No. What, you killed my aunt Kathy?

35:52.468 --> 35:53.668
You son of a bitch!

35:53.736 --> 35:54.969
How else was I gonna find you?

35:55.037 --> 35:57.004
You know, she put up a
good fight for a civilian.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.107
She is survived by her sister, Deborah.

35:59.174 --> 36:01.042
You know her as mom.

36:01.110 --> 36:04.345
I was thinking about paying
her a visit next, maybe not.

36:04.413 --> 36:09.817
So I want you to look at
this picture very closely

36:09.885 --> 36:11.753
when I ask you this question.

36:15.924 --> 36:18.893
The money... where did it go?

36:18.961 --> 36:20.795
Some guy called me.

36:20.863 --> 36:23.798
He, uh... he said he'd
kick back 100 grand in cash

36:23.866 --> 36:26.033
if I routed the funds to him
to an... an account in Antigua.

36:26.101 --> 36:28.870
Antigua? That could be
someone connected to our banks.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.239
Mr. Khan, let's not discuss
our personal affairs.

36:31.306 --> 36:34.075
I want you to give me the account
number you sent the money to now!

36:34.143 --> 36:35.309
I don't re... I don't know!

36:35.377 --> 36:36.677
It... it was a year ago. I can't remember.

36:36.745 --> 36:39.480
It's over. The money's
gone. Let's just shoot him!

36:39.548 --> 36:41.416
What did I say about
threatening his life?!

36:41.483 --> 36:43.050
I don't know what his problem is,

36:43.118 --> 36:44.685
but if you want to find your money,

36:44.753 --> 36:46.387
you'll tell him to keep his mouth shut.

36:46.455 --> 36:48.222
Lei. Lei, enough.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.725
Jesse. May I call you Jesse?

36:50.793 --> 36:52.527
I want you to think about your aunt Kathy

36:52.594 --> 36:54.762
and about her last moments on earth

36:54.830 --> 36:56.297
and whether you want the same thing

36:56.365 --> 36:57.865
to happen to the rest of your family.

36:57.933 --> 37:03.271
I want you to look at her
and you think about her.

37:03.338 --> 37:05.840
Does this jog your memory?

37:05.908 --> 37:07.909
And don't tell me you don't know.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.644
Spies... they're trained to lie.

37:09.711 --> 37:11.879
They're also trained to remember numbers.

37:15.250 --> 37:17.718
He's gonna kill me.

37:17.786 --> 37:18.820
You think I won't kill her?!

37:18.887 --> 37:22.223
9-alpha-64-2-echo-35-Charlie-01.

37:22.291 --> 37:23.624
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?

37:23.692 --> 37:25.660
Now, what you'll need to do
is find out whose account...

37:25.727 --> 37:28.095
- You're lying! That's mine!
- You stay off him!

37:28.163 --> 37:29.697
That's my account! How
did you get that number?!

37:29.765 --> 37:31.199
Khan, you tell him to put that gun down!

37:31.266 --> 37:32.834
I have given you
everything you've asked for.

37:37.973 --> 37:40.475
What are you doing?

37:40.542 --> 37:43.878
You know what happens to
people who steal from me, huh?!

37:43.946 --> 37:45.413
Huh?!

37:52.554 --> 37:56.390
Mr. Khan. Mr. Khan!

37:58.594 --> 38:00.161
I've seen that wound before.

38:00.229 --> 38:03.164
He'll survive, but you got
to get him to the hospital.

38:03.232 --> 38:04.599
That was awfully Christian of you,

38:04.666 --> 38:06.100
giving Khan free medical advice.

38:06.168 --> 38:08.169
<i>Well, I have seen that wound before.</i>

38:08.237 --> 38:10.471
And he'll be dead in five minutes.

38:10.539 --> 38:12.573
Oh, go through all that
trouble to save my ass

38:12.641 --> 38:14.842
and leave the old guy
in charge of the getaway?

38:14.910 --> 38:17.645
Buckle up, rookie. Try not
to bleed on the upholstery.

38:24.620 --> 38:27.655
Got to hand it to you... your
little trio can handle its business.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.891
Yeah, we have a few notches in our belt.

38:29.958 --> 38:31.225
Hey, thank you for this,

38:31.293 --> 38:33.528
but I see why the condo
next door is vacant.

38:33.595 --> 38:35.162
There's a bee infestation.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.864
It's constant buzzing. It's like
I'm living in a freakin' hive.

38:36.932 --> 38:38.332
I got to find a new place.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.835
Well, there's no need. We
have a friend with a space.

38:40.903 --> 38:43.004
- Don't we, Michael?
- My mom?

38:43.071 --> 38:44.605
Fi, I don't think that's a good idea.

38:44.673 --> 38:46.407
She has enough burned spies in her life.

38:46.475 --> 38:48.709
Well, I already spoke to her. It's done.

38:48.777 --> 38:50.678
Okay, well, thank you, Fiona.

38:50.746 --> 38:52.914
Why did you go back to your
place when Khan grabbed you?

38:52.981 --> 38:54.749
What was worth the risk?

38:54.816 --> 38:58.386
It's a Saint Christopher's medal...

38:58.453 --> 39:00.154
Patron saint of safe passage.

39:00.222 --> 39:01.556
It belonged to my mom.

39:01.623 --> 39:04.025
She had a thing about
keeping us protected.

39:05.227 --> 39:06.427
Well, I guess it worked for you.

39:06.495 --> 39:09.330
Yeah. Yeah, just not for her.

39:21.269 --> 39:23.069
Michael.

39:23.070 --> 39:25.972
You're the man. Let's celebrate.

39:25.973 --> 39:27.908
- What are we celebrating?
- We had a great week.

39:27.909 --> 39:29.709
You won Jesse's trust.

39:29.710 --> 39:32.012
Now we can root around
inside that brain of his,

39:32.013 --> 39:33.914
and by this time Friday,
we'll have everything we need.

39:33.915 --> 39:36.149
I wouldn't be too optimistic.

39:36.150 --> 39:40.587
I'm working him for classified
details about a conspiracy.

39:40.588 --> 39:43.924
If I push too hard, he'll get suspicious.

39:43.925 --> 39:46.460
Well, if you need some
help getting him to open up,

39:46.461 --> 39:48.328
I have some friends
who can help facilitate.

39:48.329 --> 39:49.496
Torture.

39:49.497 --> 39:53.333
The point is, Michael,
we're on a clock here.

39:53.334 --> 39:56.403
So for Jesse's sake, get at it.

40:03.511 --> 40:07.747
This is my very best gun cleaner.

40:07.748 --> 40:08.949
A little goes a long way.

40:08.950 --> 40:11.518
Thank you. I'll use it wisely.

40:12.987 --> 40:14.554
He's trouble.

40:14.555 --> 40:16.122
I like him.

40:16.123 --> 40:18.792
You know, it's really nice
of you to let Jesse stay here,

40:18.793 --> 40:20.060
but he can't pay you rent.

40:20.061 --> 40:21.394
That's all right.

40:21.395 --> 40:25.265
He's already offered me
several grand in I.O.Us.

40:25.266 --> 40:26.600
Mom, I thought you wanted

40:26.601 --> 40:28.301
someone nice staying here who liked cats.

40:28.302 --> 40:29.836
Now you're sharing gun cleaner.

40:29.837 --> 40:32.439
Yeah, well, nice is overrated.

40:32.440 --> 40:35.775
And I forgot how much I hate cats.

40:35.776 --> 40:40.347
I mean, you and Sam and Fi may be nuts,

40:40.348 --> 40:42.516
but, you know, you're doing
something with your life,

40:42.517 --> 40:44.150
and I... I just like being a part of it.

40:49.490 --> 40:51.291
What kind of sissy wouldn't sleep

40:51.292 --> 40:53.193
with a gun under his pillow, anyway?

41:00.801 --> 41:03.503
Love what you've
done with the place.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.505
Don't knock it. Your mom's my decorator.

41:05.506 --> 41:06.907
I can tell.

41:06.908 --> 41:09.209
Hey, listen, if you're gonna stay here,

41:09.210 --> 41:11.978
we should probably talk
about why you were burned.

41:11.979 --> 41:13.880
I told you. I got set up.

41:13.881 --> 41:15.949
People don't just get set
up for no reason, Jesse.

41:17.618 --> 41:20.554
You asking me about
top-secret information, Westen?

41:20.555 --> 41:22.923
Well, if you're like me,

41:22.924 --> 41:25.959
you won't stop kicking over rocks
until you find out what happened.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.461
You're out in the cold, Jess.

41:28.462 --> 41:30.330
It's dangerous to do it alone.

41:30.331 --> 41:32.165
Yeah, so I've noticed.

41:35.336 --> 41:37.237
I was looking into some
pretty serious stuff

41:37.238 --> 41:38.338
when they threw me out...

41:38.339 --> 41:39.739
Wars, terror attacks.

41:39.740 --> 41:42.142
I had a lead on a guy
that was tied into it.

41:42.143 --> 41:44.077
Maybe I got too close. I don't know.

41:44.078 --> 41:45.679
You want help finding that guy?

41:49.750 --> 41:51.217
Look, before I let you in on this,

41:51.218 --> 41:54.321
I need to tell you something.

41:54.322 --> 41:55.822
I'm seeing this through.

41:55.823 --> 41:58.058
One day, the old bosses
are gonna welcome me back.

41:58.059 --> 41:59.826
They're gonna give me a commendation.

41:59.827 --> 42:01.761
I'll smile for the camera.

42:01.762 --> 42:04.164
But then I'm gonna find the
person that ruined my life.

42:06.934 --> 42:09.836
And I'm gonna kill him.

42:09.837 --> 42:12.138
Are you good with that?

42:14.041 --> 42:16.142
Yeah, I'm good with that.
