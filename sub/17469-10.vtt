00:41.241 --> 00:43.221
And I read it. It wasn't bad.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.946
- Got a lot of options?
- That's great.

00:45.111 --> 00:47.250
This record's from last March.
It's the Redstockings.

00:47.414 --> 00:49.587
Why aren't they wearing
red stockings?

00:49.916 --> 00:52.829
Hundreds of women are down
in Greenwich Village. It was a big deal.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.523
Not very compelling.
What else have you got?

00:55.688 --> 00:57.668
- In terms of rallies or--
- Yeah.

00:57.824 --> 00:59.861
Rallies. Any of them get violent?

01:01.227 --> 01:03.036
No cat fights. Sorry, man.

01:04.664 --> 01:09.477
It's just our readers have seen sit-ins,
speak-ins, fucking sleep-ins. It's a yawn.

01:09.636 --> 01:13.106
How about one woman?
One woman on the cover, the feminist.

01:14.174 --> 01:15.676
I got Gloria Steinem.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.022
- Betty Freidan.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:19.312 --> 01:20.655
Woof!

01:20.814 --> 01:22.054
Germaine Greer?

01:22.949 --> 01:24.792
And then that one.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.088
Uh-uh. No.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.232
I want a gorgeous broad. Huh?

01:28.721 --> 01:30.496
One who's badder
than a junkyard dog.

01:30.657 --> 01:33.137
- Oh, yeah.
- Gloria Steinem's not bad.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.432
- Is she the leader of this?
- It's hard to tell.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.404
Ned, do you have pictures
of them showering together?

01:37.564 --> 01:38.702
I'd like to see that.

01:39.399 --> 01:41.208
I want the idea of a woman.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.278
Yeah, I hear you, boss. Ha, ha.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.007
The symbol of a woman.
You know what I mean.

01:46.473 --> 01:52.151
Nameless. Faceless.
Yeah. And not a woman, every woman.

01:52.312 --> 01:54.019
That's no woman. That's a mannequin.

01:55.748 --> 01:59.457
When I'm walking down the street,
I stop to check out a sexy mannequin.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.156
They don't put Germaine fucking Greer
in the windows of Saks, do they?

02:02.322 --> 02:04.563
Ned, throw together three mock-ups.
We'll go from there.

02:04.724 --> 02:07.466
- Will do.
- Oh, man.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.538
I'm gonna have trouble
sleeping tonight.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.370
- Look at this.
- The feminine mistake.

02:12.532 --> 02:14.876
- I thought I had a mustache.
- Oh, right?

02:22.175 --> 02:25.645
- Buy you something sweet, young lady?
- Definitely.

02:27.914 --> 02:30.053
- I saw you kick this thing once.
- I did not.

02:30.216 --> 02:34.255
- You did, and it was goddamn adorable.
- Well, sometimes I really want my treats.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.040
I've been seeing Doug
for the past few months.

02:51.137 --> 02:53.139
Rhodes is a good man.

02:56.242 --> 02:59.348
- I've never done anything like this.
- I can't stop thinking about you.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.823
- Me, neither.
- Oh, Finn, I-- I'm sorry.

03:02.982 --> 03:08.728
Angie is-- Is looking for you.
Your-- Your wife is on the line.

03:08.888 --> 03:11.732
Thank you, Cindy.
Thanks, Patti. Thank you very much.

03:22.669 --> 03:23.670
<i>Finn?</i>

03:27.540 --> 03:29.383
<i>Whoa!</i>

03:42.121 --> 03:43.532
Patti.

03:45.091 --> 03:49.301
I don't get this Cathlyn Wilkerson girl.
I'm trying, but I just...

03:53.032 --> 03:56.036
She was a camp counselor
who played the violin.

03:56.202 --> 03:59.115
That's an unexpected feeder program
to the Weather Underground.

03:59.272 --> 04:02.412
She's pretty, a straight-A student...

04:02.575 --> 04:04.816
<i>"working on a Po“ Sci degree
at Swarthmote...</i>

04:04.978 --> 04:07.424
...and did a semester abroad
in France, and then...

04:07.580 --> 04:12.188
...she just-- What? She woke up one day,
and decided to overthrow a government?

04:12.885 --> 04:15.559
Starts building bombs? I don't--

04:16.923 --> 04:19.130
How does someone change like that?

04:19.959 --> 04:21.870
Maybe she didn't.

04:24.030 --> 04:28.536
Maybe every time she saluted the flag,
she felt like she was lying.

04:29.569 --> 04:35.542
Like the place she lived
didn't represent who she was.

04:35.975 --> 04:38.751
And every time
she took her seat in the orchestra...

04:38.911 --> 04:42.358
...instead of blending in,
she wanted to scream out.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.056
I think you just described insanity.

04:46.552 --> 04:50.022
Maybe she felt like a soda bottle...

04:50.189 --> 04:55.104
...that the world was just
shaking and shaking.

04:55.828 --> 04:59.674
- And then one day the cap comes off.
- So she didn't evolve and change.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.072
- She--
- Burst.

05:15.915 --> 05:17.758
Did you get what you need?

05:18.284 --> 05:20.730
Yeah. Good, thanks.

06:14.807 --> 06:16.844

06:17.009 --> 06:18.750
Sure. Yes.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.482
Let's go out.

06:55.748 --> 06:56.783
Café Viand.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.223
Pancakes for the kids, mimosas for us.

07:00.386 --> 07:01.888
That sounds nice.

07:07.093 --> 07:10.199
- Woodhouse here.
- McFadden here.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.172
Jesus, Wick, how the hell are you?

07:12.665 --> 07:16.579
I'm talking to you on a Sunday morning,
so things could probably be better.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.848
You called me,
you cranky son of a bitch.

07:20.006 --> 07:22.077
Yeah. Something's going on
in your magazine.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.486
News of the Week's in trouble.

07:24.644 --> 07:29.252
And I'd rather have this conversation
face to face. You got 20 minutes tonight?

07:30.183 --> 07:32.254
Reggie's, 7:30 sound good?

07:32.418 --> 07:33.453
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:33.619 --> 07:35.360
Sounds good.

07:37.657 --> 07:41.161
- What does he want?
- His job back, I'm guessing.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.466
Son of a bitch puts in three months
at TIME magazine...

07:43.629 --> 07:46.974
...he's already crawling back.
It was inevitable.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.341
Well. Girls, get up.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.881
We're going out for breakfast.

07:58.377 --> 08:01.847
I appreciate everyone
coming out on a Sunday morning.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.927
I need one of you to speak at
the press conference tomorrow.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.253
Oh, aren't you gonna speak?

08:07.420 --> 08:10.924
I'll explain the legal process,
but one of you needs to tell your story.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.296
What you're doing and why.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.529
Well, Patti, aren't you the obvious one?

08:16.028 --> 08:17.666
Oh, yeah.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.468
Jane.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.673
I want you to do it.

08:21.834 --> 08:26.044
Yes. Jane. You would be great.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.616
All right. I'll do it.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.785
So I make it personal...?

08:32.945 --> 08:35.619
You're speaking for
every woman in America.

08:36.414 --> 08:39.054
Jane just got
her first legitimate writing assignment.

08:40.753 --> 08:42.426
We're in the home stretch.

08:42.587 --> 08:45.501
For the next 24 hours,
we carry around our secret.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.467
I don't want you to
say a word to anyone...

08:47.627 --> 08:50.073
...but I know some of y'all
are gonna talk, so...

08:50.229 --> 08:54.644
...please, for the love
of all things holy, be judicious.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.677
We want to open
our news conference...

08:56.836 --> 09:00.340
...just as News of the Week's issue
on feminism hits the stands.

09:00.506 --> 09:02.816
- Eleanor.
- Yes, June.

09:02.975 --> 09:04.386
What should we wear?

09:05.177 --> 09:07.919
Clothes, shoes. Bras are optional.

09:09.248 --> 09:11.819
A suit or a dress?

09:12.919 --> 09:16.093
You wear whatever makes you feel
beautiful and brave...

09:16.255 --> 09:18.292
...and not necessarily in that order.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.297
Let's see that.

09:24.630 --> 09:25.768
Mm.

09:25.932 --> 09:27.934
What a bunch of revolutionaries.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.641
Gentlemen.

10:41.407 --> 10:42.579
- Good morning.
- Hollander.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.881
- Happy Sunday.
- Morning, Carl.

10:45.044 --> 10:48.457
- I got a note from Bea Burkhart. Yep.
- About "When Our Boys Come Home"?

10:48.614 --> 10:50.184
Congratulations.

10:50.349 --> 10:51.987
The last time she sent a note
was to Peter...

10:52.151 --> 10:54.153
...for his investigation
into falsified medical reports.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.960
Then it was a straight shot
to the Moscow bureau for him.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.967
She mentioned you
as head researcher.

11:00.126 --> 11:03.869
She did? Thank you for telling me that.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.969
Oh, how's Noah been
since the piece ran?

11:09.135 --> 11:10.910
Same. He likes to drink beer.

11:12.271 --> 11:15.514
- I actually got a few job leads for him.
- So he's more than a source.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.945
That fight at Patti's
was a one-time thing.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.556
It's not like he walks around
punching people.

11:20.713 --> 11:23.421
I'm actually stopping by
his place tonight. Want to come?

11:24.450 --> 11:26.452
I have plans,
but please tell him I said hi.

11:26.952 --> 11:28.431
Will do.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.633
Oh, please tell me
you went home last night.

11:37.797 --> 11:40.175
I did. You look nice.

11:40.332 --> 11:42.676
Thank you. Are you free tonight?

11:43.335 --> 11:45.144
So far, yeah. You?

11:45.771 --> 11:46.943
I want to see you.

11:47.106 --> 11:49.484
Well, then, I think
we can make that happen.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.580
Let's go out for a good dinner, steak.

11:52.745 --> 11:55.021
Maybe I could
make you dinner at your place.

11:55.781 --> 11:59.354
- Even better.
- Okay. I'm on it.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.523
Promise?

12:04.590 --> 12:06.228
Missing you lately.

12:27.980 --> 12:31.018
- Tip of the hat to you, Jane.
- Hello.

12:38.157 --> 12:41.570
I feel strongly that we
should give her a heads up.

12:41.727 --> 12:43.070
- Why?
- We need to think about...

12:43.229 --> 12:45.300
...what happens after we file.

12:45.464 --> 12:49.310
- We need Mrs. Burkhart's support.
- If we had her behind us--

12:49.468 --> 12:53.974
- That would be a huge get.
- Yes. And telling her is good karma.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.610
I'm falling in love with you, Jane.

12:57.877 --> 13:01.586
But what if she tells Finn,
and we all get fired?

13:02.748 --> 13:04.352
Let's tell her at the last minute.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.088
It's a gesture of respect,
but it doesn't change anything.

13:07.253 --> 13:11.201
Good plan. She's speaking
at the Washington Press Club tomorrow.

13:11.357 --> 13:14.133
So she'll be at her home in Bethesda.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.136
That means one of us should fly down...

13:16.295 --> 13:18.639
...and be in position
to tell her tomorrow morning.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.110
I'll do it.

13:22.701 --> 13:26.444
Cindy, that would mean
that you're not at the press conference.

13:26.605 --> 13:29.381
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

13:30.342 --> 13:31.685
Yes.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.087
Someone has to do it...

13:36.382 --> 13:38.293
...and I've never been
on a plane before.

13:40.686 --> 13:44.691
Well, all right, then.
I'll fly out first thing in the morning.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.165
How would it affect layout?

13:52.331 --> 13:54.368
<i>- I'll</i> show you.
- Show Gregory.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.013
I'm gonna pull Robinson
into this. Come here.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.482
What do you think of this?

14:05.110 --> 14:08.387
Sexy as hell,
and it makes feminism feel edgy. Right?

14:10.049 --> 14:11.289
Are there other options?

14:12.785 --> 14:14.230
Well...

14:15.054 --> 14:17.398
I mean, that's a joke.
The car is pasted in.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.267
Get it? She's strong.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.634
I know, this isn't a joke. Um...

14:25.831 --> 14:27.401
Well, l...

14:27.600 --> 14:29.580
This does not make me
want to buy the magazine.

14:29.735 --> 14:32.215
What about a photo of
several women together, smiling.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.942
- Maybe one of them has a baby--
- How will we know they're feminists?

14:35.107 --> 14:36.780
How do you know that
lips here is a feminist?

14:36.942 --> 14:38.148
Well, that's a different message.

14:38.310 --> 14:42.656
Oh, sexual freedom
is only one part of liberation.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.923
But it's undoubtedly
the part that keeps us coming back.

14:46.085 --> 14:47.860
What's the other part?

14:49.788 --> 14:52.792
Women realizing
that other women are restless too.

14:53.759 --> 14:55.670
They may
all want different things...

14:55.828 --> 14:58.468
...but ultimately, they want
the same thing. Opportunity.

14:59.064 --> 15:03.877
So they band together to form
a tribe that understands one another.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.653
I like lips.

15:13.245 --> 15:16.158
Okay. I'll see your lips...

15:16.548 --> 15:17.891
...and I'll raise you.

15:18.484 --> 15:21.795
Take that lipstick off. Make her real.

15:22.554 --> 15:25.831
That's what women,
especially young women, want.

15:25.991 --> 15:28.904
They want it to be real.
No more paper dolls.

15:33.532 --> 15:34.738
I'm glad we're doing this issue.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.904
I think it's gonna mean a lot
to the other girls in the pit.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.743
That is music to my ears.
Come tomorrow...

15:39.905 --> 15:42.249
...the newsroom will be full
of smiles, and girls in good moods.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.615
On days like that, who doesn't love
coming to work. Am I right?

15:44.777 --> 15:46.313
Right-o.

15:46.578 --> 15:47.989
Thanks for schooling me.

15:58.357 --> 16:00.837
You have an uncluttered way
of expressing yourself.

16:00.993 --> 16:01.994
I'm very neat.

16:02.161 --> 16:04.607
I wasn't saying you are
tidy around the house.

16:04.763 --> 16:09.610
I was referring to-- Thank you.
--the way in which you reason.

16:09.768 --> 16:12.248
The way you describe things logically,
it's enviable.

16:12.671 --> 16:19.145
But your statement sounds
like someone with a safety net.

16:19.311 --> 16:23.225
Someone who comes from privilege,
with nothing on the line.

16:23.382 --> 16:26.226
And at this conference,
do you know who you are?

16:26.385 --> 16:28.797
You are oppressed.

16:28.954 --> 16:32.367
So speak from your heart. Stop trying
to make everyone feel comfortable.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.171
I think I can still make my point
without being rude.

16:35.327 --> 16:38.467
Bullshit. No one cares
if you thank them for attending.

16:38.630 --> 16:42.134
They wanna know why a pretty white girl
with every advantage in the world...

16:42.301 --> 16:45.282
...wants to work hard when she
could marry, have babies...

16:45.437 --> 16:47.417
...and get her hair done once a week.

16:47.573 --> 16:48.813
I see.

16:48.974 --> 16:51.352
Jane, I wanted you
to be the speaker tomorrow...

16:51.510 --> 16:53.888
...because you are focused
and self-possessed.

16:54.046 --> 16:55.753
And you remind me of myself.

16:56.248 --> 16:58.888
Watching you, I realize
how intimidating I must be.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.932
I always thought that I would be
standing next to my husband...

17:07.192 --> 17:13.006
...as he announced his bid for office,
or thanked his colleagues for an award.

17:13.432 --> 17:17.403
I never thought that I would be the one
standing up in front of the microphone.

I'm doing well at TIME,
so let's get that out of the way.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.570
- Okay.
- And I'm not here to tell you...

17:44.730 --> 17:47.233
...we want to hire you away
from News of the <i>Week.</i>

17:47.399 --> 17:50.175

Who's playing me, Wick?

18:03.415 --> 18:04.792
Gregory Sansone.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.624
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

18:13.392 --> 18:17.033
You know, I have a lot of respect
for the institution that gave me my career.

18:17.196 --> 18:18.937
You don't know him.

18:20.299 --> 18:21.744

18:22.701 --> 18:26.877
...how much ad money is coming from
the Big Three since you hired Gregory?

18:27.039 --> 18:29.451
That's proprietary information,
Wick, you know that.

18:30.275 --> 18:34.553
Car companies were promised
favorable coverage from him...

18:34.713 --> 18:36.317
...in return for big ad buys.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.325
You can't promise favorable coverage.

18:39.585 --> 18:43.328
The profile on Ralph Nader,
on car safety.

I got 3O years at News of the <i>Week.</i>

18:51.830 --> 18:53.707
Now, if this magazine goes down...

18:53.866 --> 18:58.838
...as a useless rag
that sold its soul out for ad buys...

18:59.671 --> 19:03.483
...people look at me differently,
as if it was going on the whole time.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.122
It wasn't, and it isn't.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.258
You need to look under the bed, Finn.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.661
I grew up with Gregory.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.105
One drink with a guy I fired...

19:22.261 --> 19:25.174
...isn't gonna convince me
you know him better than I do.

19:33.372 --> 19:36.546

19:49.454 --> 19:51.730
- The truth is, I--
- Yeah, I made some calls.

19:51.890 --> 19:55.497

but all of them are looking.

19:56.228 --> 19:58.401

I didn't think you were gonna do it.

Stopped by Mom's place.

20:21.353 --> 20:25.096
She's good. She's, uh, good.

22:54.005 --> 22:57.316

I want to be the bureau chief in Cairo.

23:03.115 --> 23:08.155

And I'm going to interview bedouins.

23:29.508 --> 23:32.512
Before they go off
to wherever they want.

23:33.612 --> 23:37.788
And then I could maybe
jet in and out for a week or two...

23:37.949 --> 23:39.485
...and write feature stories.

23:39.651 --> 23:43.155

breaking news. You know?

could have told me at any point.

26:04.329 --> 26:07.435

- Told on you?

- That was months ago.

26:51.242 --> 26:53.779

not a reporter.

26:53.945 --> 26:58.985

catch all of your mistakes...

make you look brilliant.

28:41.453 --> 28:46.368
Lenny, do you remember,
a couple months ago...

28:46.524 --> 28:50.529
...when I asked you
about that civil-rights law?

28:50.995 --> 28:52.440
No.

28:52.597 --> 28:59.071
Well, I asked you about the rights
of women, uh, to be reporters.

28:59.537 --> 29:00.607
Vaguely.

29:04.976 --> 29:08.788
I was asking because
News of the Week...

29:08.947 --> 29:11.860
...relegates women to research jobs.

29:13.051 --> 29:15.429
And that is not fair.

29:17.489 --> 29:21.335
We are filing a complaint
with the EEOC...

29:22.827 --> 29:27.799
-...the Equal Employment Opportunity--
- I know what the EEOC is, Cindy.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.340
You need a lawyer, you know.

29:34.339 --> 29:36.182
We have one.

29:36.808 --> 29:40.950

29:41.613 --> 29:44.423

29:44.582 --> 29:45.856
Yes.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.562
When?

29:47.752 --> 29:50.289
Just before Christmas.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.167

29:56.294 --> 29:57.671

30:00.365 --> 30:02.402
It is.

30:03.768 --> 30:06.544
This is me, Lenny.

30:07.872 --> 30:11.149
How will you be a wife and a mother
if you're at the office all day?

30:11.309 --> 30:13.255
Did you think about that?

30:15.980 --> 30:17.584
You are so fucking selfish.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.467

30:33.164 --> 30:34.234
Oh, Jesus.

30:36.134 --> 30:37.636

30:40.605 --> 30:43.313
- Holy shit.
- I'm fine.

30:52.150 --> 30:54.653
I don't want to be your wife anymore.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.949

32:15.033 --> 32:17.240
It's not your fault.

32:17.468 --> 32:19.209
You did everything you could.

32:19.971 --> 32:21.712
No, I didn't.

32:21.873 --> 32:24.183
I didn't do a goddamn thing.

32:24.409 --> 32:28.186

and I-- I used him.

32:28.346 --> 32:31.418

because of you.

32:44.562 --> 32:46.701
He wasn't like this before.

32:47.498 --> 32:49.205
He came back different.

32:49.367 --> 32:51.244
And l...

33:21.933 --> 33:23.344
I-

33:26.971 --> 33:28.917
It's okay.

33:31.642 --> 33:34.213
I need this too.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.004
Janey.

36:11.736 --> 36:13.613
What happened? Are you all right?

36:13.771 --> 36:20.211
Yes. I just didn't want to use my key
in case the alarm was on.

36:21.879 --> 36:27.329
- Your mother's asleep.
- Good. I can't stay, my cab is waiting.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.890
You've thought more
about the law firm.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.168
No.

36:34.325 --> 36:36.828
I wanted to give you this.

36:37.295 --> 36:40.174
I love my apartment,
but I think it's time for me to move.

36:40.331 --> 36:42.242
You're giving me back
your rent check?

36:42.400 --> 36:44.641
I want to pay my own rent now. I work.

36:44.802 --> 36:47.339
Okay, well,
I'm not gonna let you sacrifice safety.

36:47.505 --> 36:49.781
If you want to put
your pin money toward rent...

36:49.941 --> 36:52.820
...so you feel some sense
of ownership, it's fine...

36:53.377 --> 36:56.449
...but you're not downgrading
to Hell's Kitchen.

36:56.614 --> 37:00.562
You and Mommy
have been so generous with me.

37:00.718 --> 37:04.165
But I want to pay my own way.

37:04.322 --> 37:08.236
Okay. I'll see you on Thursday,
then, when you run out of money.

37:08.392 --> 37:09.496
Oh...

37:10.228 --> 37:13.107
There's something else
that I want to tell you.

37:16.267 --> 37:19.009
L-- I signed, um...

37:20.871 --> 37:22.817
I joined the-- I'm-- I'm part of--

37:22.974 --> 37:27.616
Janey, think about
what you want to say and say it.

37:30.815 --> 37:33.455
I'm part of an EEOC complaint
against News of the Week...

37:33.618 --> 37:35.393
...because they don't let women write.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.895
And that's illegal.
We have an attorney.

37:40.057 --> 37:41.661
- You have an attorney?
- Mm-hm.

37:41.826 --> 37:44.636
Janey, where's this coming from?
Are you using drugs?

37:46.797 --> 37:51.371
I have the right
to become a reporter. That's only fair.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.177
Uh...

37:54.338 --> 37:55.976
Okay, um...

37:56.807 --> 37:59.151
For argument's sake,
I'll ask you the same question...

37:59.310 --> 38:02.086
...that I'd ask your brother.
Do you have a five-year plan?

38:06.717 --> 38:07.855
No?

38:12.089 --> 38:14.160
I have a three-year plan.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.065
I'll become a reporter first.

38:19.096 --> 38:23.977
And then I'll apply
to the master's in law program at Yale.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.809
It's for journalists who want
to cover the Supreme Court.

38:26.971 --> 38:31.613
I want to write about
the highest court in the land.

38:31.942 --> 38:36.516
And I would be
the first woman to do that.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.154
If we win.

38:39.483 --> 38:42.464
If they let me become a reporter.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.896
Because I need clips
to apply to the law program.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.433
How will you pay
for graduate school?

38:46.590 --> 38:49.127
- Did you think about that?
- There are fellowships.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.065
I see.

38:55.533 --> 38:57.877
Fine. So you don't need anything.

38:58.035 --> 38:59.639
Or anyone.

39:05.643 --> 39:07.589
I need you, Daddy.

39:09.280 --> 39:12.022
And I want you to be proud of me.

39:30.234 --> 39:32.339
Those sons of bitches
at Yale rejected me.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.117
You should apply to Radcliffe.

40:11.108 --> 40:12.519
What?

40:19.617 --> 40:23.588
I may have to fire Gregory,
and I dread telling you because...

40:23.754 --> 40:27.793
...you'll think it's an excuse
for me to be preoccupied with work.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.304
You can tell me.

40:43.007 --> 40:44.509
I wasn't at the office tonight.

40:51.615 --> 40:53.288
Took a long walk.

40:54.051 --> 40:55.325
That's where I was.

41:22.079 --> 41:23.490
Talia.

41:24.448 --> 41:26.553
What's happening to me?

41:28.319 --> 41:31.198
It couldn't take place unless--

41:34.124 --> 41:36.570
Unless something
had happened here first.

41:41.398 --> 41:44.504
I wanted it to work more than anything.

41:47.438 --> 41:49.975
I'm going to check into
The Sherry-Netherland.

41:56.313 --> 41:58.315
What are we going to tell the girls?

42:59.043 --> 43:00.613
- What the hell?
- Morning.

43:01.045 --> 43:04.322
Do you know how to work this thing?
Where are the girls? Where's Patti?

43:04.481 --> 43:05.858
She can do this.

43:06.584 --> 43:09.827
I don't know. I'll go downstairs
and grab you a cup of coffee.

43:09.987 --> 43:11.489
- I need to talk to you.
- As luck would have it...

43:11.655 --> 43:14.602
...we're both here together
dying of fucking dehydration.

43:15.893 --> 43:19.705
I want to cover the war.
I want you to send me to Vietnam.

43:21.799 --> 43:23.278
Why Vietnam?

43:23.500 --> 43:27.312
Because it's the biggest
foreign story in the world...

43:27.471 --> 43:29.314
...and I want combat experience.

43:29.640 --> 43:33.315
Never thought you'd be opposed to me
running to danger for the sake of a story.

43:33.477 --> 43:36.481
Vietnam's been going on for years.
Why do you want to go now?

43:37.381 --> 43:39.884
The Weather Underground story
gave me...

43:40.484 --> 43:43.556
...a taste of covering life and death.
I want more of it.

43:44.254 --> 43:47.030
All right, just send me,
I'll produce for you.

43:47.658 --> 43:49.103
I'll let you cover the war.

43:49.259 --> 43:50.499
The one here.

43:50.694 --> 43:53.538
Vietnam's winding down
or dragging on, I'm not sure which.

43:53.697 --> 43:54.732
You're kidding me.

43:54.898 --> 43:56.707
This war at home.
It's got dozens of bombs...

43:56.867 --> 43:58.312
...going off throughout
New York City each month...

43:58.469 --> 44:00.415
...that needs to be covered
by great writers like you.

44:00.571 --> 44:03.177
- I've done that for two years.
- I'm editor-at-large of this magazine.

44:03.340 --> 44:06.514
I call the shots. I want you to keep doing
what you're doing.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.127
Do you?

44:12.483 --> 44:15.760
- Do you call the shots here?
- I don't know what crawled up your ass--

44:15.919 --> 44:20.368
Either I write for News of the Week over
there or I write for another publication.

44:25.062 --> 44:26.370
Where is everyone?

44:26.530 --> 44:28.441
Go downstairs
and get me a cup of coffee.

44:30.234 --> 44:31.975
Yeah, sure.

44:49.019 --> 44:52.193
Mrs. Burkhart, Cindy Reston.

44:57.227 --> 44:59.036
Good morning.

44:59.229 --> 45:03.006
Well, this is the first time
I've received an urgent visit--

45:03.367 --> 45:05.074
That's the word you used, isn't it?

45:05.235 --> 45:08.739
--From a researcher
from News of the Week.

45:12.643 --> 45:15.817
Much less this early in the morning.
Not to mention...

45:16.814 --> 45:18.794
...without a call first.

45:19.416 --> 45:21.089
Heh...

45:21.685 --> 45:26.828
Well, it is my first time in Washington.

45:29.393 --> 45:33.170
Your home is lovely.

45:39.903 --> 45:41.712
What the hell's going on?

45:44.208 --> 45:49.590
I know that it may seem rude,
me showing up like this...

45:49.747 --> 45:56.392
...but it was actually meant
to be the opposite, to be extra polite.

45:57.988 --> 45:59.058
Mrs. Burkhart...

46:00.190 --> 46:03.660
...this morning, there is going
to be a press conference.

46:04.294 --> 46:07.173
Several dozen researchers
from News of the <i>Week...</i>

46:07.331 --> 46:10.869
...are going to ask
to be treated equally.

46:13.036 --> 46:14.913
I'm not following.

46:18.008 --> 46:19.783
Equal...

46:20.043 --> 46:21.920
...to the men.

46:23.981 --> 46:26.188
You girls want to do men's jobs?

46:26.884 --> 46:31.856
Federal law gives women
the same opportunities as men.

46:32.790 --> 46:37.796
But News of the Week
won't allow women to be reporters.

46:38.061 --> 46:42.601
So we have filed a complaint
with the EEOC.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.744
But I'm the publisher.

46:52.276 --> 46:53.448
Yeah.

46:56.046 --> 46:59.027
So whose side
am I supposed to be on?

47:10.027 --> 47:13.531
What did you tell the car companies
about our Ralph Nader story?

47:14.131 --> 47:15.974
I don't remember word for word.

47:16.133 --> 47:18.875
I know it brought in revenue.
So you're welcome.

47:20.170 --> 47:24.084
Revenue's easy.
It's earning it with integrity.

47:24.508 --> 47:27.785
You can't undo the impression
that we're for sale.

47:27.945 --> 47:30.448
Finn. Finn!

47:31.582 --> 47:34.324
Bea Burkhart's on the phone.
She says it's an emergency.

47:43.760 --> 47:47.674
Finn, lawyers from the New York office
are headed your way...

47:48.265 --> 47:51.246
...and I am madder than hell.

48:05.515 --> 48:06.926
It's almost showtime, ladies.

48:07.084 --> 48:09.086
Eleanor, what happens now?

48:09.653 --> 48:10.688
This.

48:10.854 --> 48:14.495
But after this,
do we go back to work as reporters?

48:14.658 --> 48:18.765
The purpose of today
is to publicly embarrass your bosses.

48:19.129 --> 48:21.609
Our hope is that they
voluntarily submit to the law...

48:21.765 --> 48:23.210
...instead of waiting
for the commission rule.

48:23.367 --> 48:25.506
So we go back
as researchers and wait?

48:25.669 --> 48:28.775
Yes, but I dare any man
that works at News of the Week...

48:28.972 --> 48:31.248
...to try and hold his head up high
after this.

48:31.408 --> 48:32.648
But this isn't personal.

48:33.677 --> 48:36.851
Of course it is.
Outside of a person's love...

48:37.014 --> 48:39.824
...the only thing more sacred
they can give is their labor.

48:39.983 --> 48:42.862
You've given the magazine
your labor, and they've used you.

48:43.220 --> 48:45.962
- But I don't think--
- They take us for granted, Patti.

48:46.123 --> 48:47.830
Now they can't be slippery with us.

48:48.392 --> 48:51.464
We're trying them
in the court of public opinion.

48:51.929 --> 48:53.931
Eleanor, where should we sit?

48:54.097 --> 48:56.668
- Jane. I have to go.
- What?

48:57.200 --> 49:00.477
- I have to go tell Finn. He should hear--
- No, Patti. We need you here.

49:01.405 --> 49:03.407
This will ruin his career, Jane.

49:04.641 --> 49:07.087
Other places let women write.

49:07.244 --> 49:11.124
He won't let us write.
He could, but he doesn't.

49:12.149 --> 49:13.924
I have to.

Speaking on behalf
of the women, Jane Hollander.

51:51.541 --> 51:53.077
Good morning.

51:55.679 --> 52:01.220
We have asked sweetly to be allowed
to prove ourselves at the office.

52:01.785 --> 52:06.325
We have asked permission to be
treated equally to men we work next to.

52:07.657 --> 52:09.330
Enough.

52:09.726 --> 52:14.175
Today, we demand that
our employer comply with federal law.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.442
At News of the Week,
women are not permitted...

52:17.601 --> 52:20.047
...to appear in the magazine
under a byline.

52:20.203 --> 52:23.116
And yet, we know the magazine
would not achieve...

52:23.273 --> 52:27.244
...the level of quality it is known for
without our contributions.

52:28.178 --> 52:31.921
There is no mysterious
God-given talent required...

52:32.082 --> 52:34.289
...to the reporter at News of the <i>Week.</i>

52:35.685 --> 52:42.102
It is a mixture of talent,
hard work, and opportunity.
