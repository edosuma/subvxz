Come on.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.126
[sighs]

21:33.209 --> 21:34.544
Full team, full team,
full team.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.337
Okay, I'm coming,
coming right now.

21:36.421 --> 21:37.797
[cheering in video game]

21:37.880 --> 21:39.424
Wait. You see one?

21:39.507 --> 21:41.592
- Cracked one, cracked one.
- Nice.
- Got him.

21:41.676 --> 21:43.344
See you guys later.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.140
Damn!

21:47.223 --> 21:48.683
- [whistle blows in game]
- Are you kidding? No.

21:48.766 --> 21:51.352
Yeah, fine, just abandon
the game completely, Jere.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.521
You... look... hot.

21:53.604 --> 21:54.939
[Belly laughs]

21:55.023 --> 21:56.774
Hey, hey, hey,
stop flirting with my sister.

21:56.858 --> 21:58.901
- Shut up, Steven.
- No, you shut up.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.529
Well, you look good, though.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.781
[laughs] You driving with,
or are you meeting us there?

22:03.865 --> 22:06.451
I'm not going
to the book party.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.327
I'm going to the drive-in.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.788
- With who?
- [phone chimes]

22:10.872 --> 22:12.957
- Dude, dude, focus. Come on.
- Um...

22:13.041 --> 22:16.252
[laughing] Uh, okay. Bye.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.882
[Steven] All right,
let me catch you up.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.856
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.858
You look... less wistful.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.318
I, uh... I-I feel less wistful.

22:40.401 --> 22:42.487
[laughing] Okay, good.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.322
What movie are we seeing?

22:44.405 --> 22:47.116
Uh, it's some old movie
called, uh, Sabrina.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.078
Audrey Hepburn?
Two brothers? That Sabrina?

22:50.161 --> 22:52.497
- I think, so. Yeah.
- Yeah? I-I love that movie.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.083
- It got really great reviews.
- Oh, cool. I'm-I'm sure it did.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.085
- It's really good.
- Yeah? Good.

22:57.168 --> 22:59.170
Yeah.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.091
[Sabrina] And as
had been traditional

23:03.174 --> 23:05.468
on Long Island
for the past 30 years,

23:05.551 --> 23:08.638
the Larrabees were
giving a party.

23:08.721 --> 23:13.017
It never rained on the night
of the Larrabee party.

23:13.101 --> 23:15.645
The Larrabees wouldn't
have stood for it.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.980
There were four Larrabees
in all:

23:18.064 --> 23:22.068
father, mother and two sons.

23:22.151 --> 23:26.155
Maude and Oliver Larrabee
were married in 1906,

23:26.239 --> 23:28.491
and among
their many wedding presents

23:28.574 --> 23:32.286
was a townhouse in New York
and this estate for weekends.

23:32.370 --> 23:34.413
Are you sure you don't want
something to drink or...?

23:34.497 --> 23:37.250
- Yeah, I'm okay, thanks.
- Yeah.

23:38.251 --> 23:41.379
[Sabrina] Linus Larrabee,
the elder son,

23:41.462 --> 23:45.883
graduated from Yale,
where his classmates voted him

23:45.967 --> 23:50.263
the man most likely to leave
his alma mater $50 million.

23:50.346 --> 23:53.015
His brother David

23:53.099 --> 23:56.018
went through several
of the best Eastern colleges

23:56.102 --> 23:58.104
for short periods of time,

23:58.187 --> 24:00.439
and through several marriages

24:00.523 --> 24:02.859
for even shorter periods
of time.

24:03.901 --> 24:07.321
He is now a successful
six-goal polo player

24:07.405 --> 24:09.991
and is listed
on Linus's tax return

24:10.074 --> 24:12.952
as a $600 deduction.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.290
Life was pleasant
among the Larrabees,

24:17.373 --> 24:22.712
for this was as close to heaven
as one could get on Long Island.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.339
[movie music plays]

24:25.423 --> 24:27.550
[quietly] Don't drop it.

24:27.633 --> 24:30.553
[indistinct chatter]

24:30.636 --> 24:32.555
You can do it, all right?

24:32.638 --> 24:34.724
[laughs]

24:52.241 --> 24:54.869
Thank you. [laughs]

24:57.580 --> 25:00.333
I really liked it.

25:00.416 --> 25:03.669
- You read my book?
- Yeah. Yeah.

25:03.753 --> 25:05.296
I thought it was,
uh, really interesting

25:05.379 --> 25:08.841
how you made, um, Iris
an unreliable narrator.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.470
In what way?

25:12.553 --> 25:15.097
[laughs] Just, uh, how the story
she was telling us

25:15.181 --> 25:18.267
about her marriage, I mean, so
clearly wasn't the real story.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.269
- [laughs]
- I'm not sure
that's entirely true,

25:20.353 --> 25:22.146
but okay.

25:22.230 --> 25:23.564
[man] Great to meet you,
Cleveland.

25:23.648 --> 25:25.650
- Can't wait for the next one.
- Yeah. You, too.

25:25.733 --> 25:29.320
So, what is the next one?

25:29.403 --> 25:31.322
It's mainly about sailing.

25:31.405 --> 25:34.325
Yeah, it's sort of
a modern epic.

25:34.408 --> 25:35.910
You sail?

25:35.993 --> 25:37.703
Are you surprised?
Is that...? [laughs]

25:37.787 --> 25:42.083
Kind of. I thought you were,
like, a Brooklyn hipster.

25:42.166 --> 25:45.002
- Ooh.
- Do people say
"hipster" anymore?

25:45.086 --> 25:47.838
- No. [laughs]
- [laughs]

25:47.922 --> 25:50.258
But you're right.
I don't sail.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.009
You know, I am trying to learn.

25:52.093 --> 25:54.679
You know, I like...

25:54.762 --> 25:57.139
I like to write about things
I know nothing about,

25:57.223 --> 26:00.393
to completely immerse myself
in new worlds.

26:00.476 --> 26:04.146
And the problem is...
I am completely lost at sea.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.232
[both laugh]

26:08.150 --> 26:10.069
You see that boy over there?

26:10.152 --> 26:13.489
Oh, yeah, the one who's been
pounding chardonnay all night.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.367
- Yeah.
- Oh, Conrad?

26:16.450 --> 26:17.785
Come over here.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.957
[Cleveland laughs]

26:23.958 --> 26:25.960
Conrad, this is Cleveland.

26:26.043 --> 26:28.129
He's writing a book
about sailing

26:28.212 --> 26:30.423
but also knows nothing
about sailing.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.508
- [laughs]
- Conrad's a great sailor.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.635
You won a regatta
last year, right?

26:34.719 --> 26:36.387
Came in second, but...

26:36.470 --> 26:38.472
Ah.

26:38.556 --> 26:41.434
So, uh, do you teach?

26:41.517 --> 26:43.561
You know, I could, uh,
use some lessons.

26:43.644 --> 26:46.439
- [laughing] So... yeah.
- [Laurel laughs]

26:48.816 --> 26:50.735
Did my mom put you up to this?

26:50.818 --> 26:52.778
What? Why?

26:53.821 --> 26:55.823
Typical.

27:00.494 --> 27:02.496
[sighs]

27:02.580 --> 27:04.749
A man of few words?

27:04.832 --> 27:06.834
Apparently.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.837
Um, here you go.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.715
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

27:12.798 --> 27:16.594
[Cleveland laughs softly]

27:16.677 --> 27:18.721
You know, this shit is
so boring. Can we go somewhere?

27:18.804 --> 27:20.931
- [Jeremiah chuckles softly]
- Yeah. Where?

27:21.015 --> 27:23.017
We could go into town,
I don't know,

27:23.100 --> 27:25.936
buy some weed from that guy
with the Rainbow Dash tattoo?

27:26.020 --> 27:27.938
Nah, he got arrested
last summer.

27:28.022 --> 27:30.566
- Oh, shit. Really?
- Yeah.

27:31.817 --> 27:34.278
- [Jeremiah sighs]
- Yeah, we could go
to the drive-in.

27:34.362 --> 27:37.698
Dude, gross. No, I-I don't want
to watch Belly hooking up

27:37.782 --> 27:39.408
with some kid
in the back seat of a minivan.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.956
Yo, actually...

27:46.040 --> 27:47.958
let's go to the drive-in.

27:48.042 --> 27:50.711
Wait. Like... like, really?

27:50.795 --> 27:53.672
- Yeah. Why not?
- [Steven laughs]

27:53.756 --> 27:55.800
- Yeah. Yeah!
- All right, bro.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.385
- [laughs]
- You're driving.

27:57.468 --> 27:59.512
- Oh, yes.
- Guys...

27:59.595 --> 28:02.848
Get up. Come on. [laughs]

28:02.932 --> 28:04.934
[♪ "La Vie en Rose"]

28:13.943 --> 28:16.153
Can, um...
can I ask you a question?

28:16.237 --> 28:17.780
Yeah.

28:18.823 --> 28:21.158
Why marine biology?

28:22.868 --> 28:24.787
Well, why not?

28:24.870 --> 28:27.206
I just... I feel like
it was a, um,

28:27.289 --> 28:29.208
a phase that everyone goes
through when they're little,

28:29.291 --> 28:31.335
but y-you stuck with it.

28:31.419 --> 28:33.337
Yeah.

28:33.421 --> 28:35.840
There's a jellyfish
with Benjamin Button's disease.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.425
[Linus] How do you say
in French...?

28:37.508 --> 28:39.343
- What?
- Yup.

28:39.427 --> 28:41.929
Scientists think it's immortal.

28:42.012 --> 28:44.348
But nobody knows why, though.

28:44.432 --> 28:47.351
This thing could be, like,
the cure for cancer,

28:47.435 --> 28:50.146
but how do you harness
jellyfish cells?

28:50.229 --> 28:51.897
I-I don't know. How do you?

28:51.981 --> 28:53.357
- I don't know either.
- [laughs]

28:53.441 --> 28:56.235
Nobody does. It's nuts.

28:56.318 --> 28:59.321
And, um, eels?

28:59.405 --> 29:01.991
Nobody knows how eels reproduce.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.118
- Seriously.
- Hmm.

29:04.201 --> 29:07.037
The fact that eels exist, it's
just, like, a complete anomaly.

29:07.121 --> 29:09.373
- Really?
- Yeah. It's wild.

29:09.457 --> 29:12.126
And people don't know,
you know, what's at the bottom

29:12.209 --> 29:14.462
of the Mariana Trench
either, so...

29:16.672 --> 29:19.758
So many inexplicable things
about the ocean.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.762
I want to be able
to explain them, some of them.

29:23.846 --> 29:25.848
- Totally.
- Sure.

29:25.931 --> 29:28.642
[Linus] Why are you looking
at me that way?

29:28.726 --> 29:30.895
[Sabrina] All night long,
I've had the most

29:30.978 --> 29:33.022
terrible impulse
to do something.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.274
Well, never resist
an impulse, Sabrina,

29:35.357 --> 29:36.609
especially if it's terrible.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.986
[Sabrina] I'm going to do it.

29:39.069 --> 29:40.696
[Belly] Before last night,
I'd only kissed boys

29:40.779 --> 29:43.657
during spin the bottle,
not in real life,

29:43.741 --> 29:47.244
not because
we both really want it,

29:47.328 --> 29:49.955
but the way I feel right now,

29:50.039 --> 29:53.125
this is what
everyone talks about.

29:53.209 --> 29:54.126
[Cam clears throat]

29:56.045 --> 29:59.089
Hey, could you, um,
grab me that drink, actually?

29:59.173 --> 30:01.091
Maybe like a-a Cherry Coke
or something else?

30:01.175 --> 30:02.843
Yeah, it's no problem.
Sounds good.

30:02.927 --> 30:04.303
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll be right back.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.055
Thanks.

think you're doing?!

30:13.604 --> 30:16.106
Uh, just catching the end
of our favorite movie.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.651
- I mean...
- You have no right!
You have to go!

30:18.734 --> 30:21.111
Oh, Belly, relax.
We-we were just joking around.

30:21.195 --> 30:23.822
Steven, if you don't leave,
I swear to God

30:23.906 --> 30:27.034
I will send everyone in this car

- You wouldn't.

30:29.995 --> 30:33.958
Oh, he spent an entire chapter
talking about Draco's wand.

- [Conrad] Bro.
- Oh, my God.

30:36.252 --> 30:38.337
- Steven, come on.
- You know, don't be
embarrassed, man. Draco's hot.

30:38.420 --> 30:39.838
- Drop it. Drop it.
- Hey, seriously?

30:41.048 --> 30:42.591
Please leave.

30:42.675 --> 30:43.634
[Linus] ...or fallen through.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.261
Let me put it this way.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.555
- All right, let's go, guys.
- What?
- Wait. What?

30:47.638 --> 30:49.306
- [Steven] Are you kidding me?
- Steven, drive the car.

30:49.390 --> 30:51.725
You were the one
who wanted to come, Conrad.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.687
[Oliver] I seem to have missed
something here.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.564
Would you mind starting
all over again?

30:56.647 --> 30:58.440
[Linus] Now, Miss McCardle.

30:58.524 --> 31:01.235
Elizabeth, I hate to have
to break the news to you,

31:01.318 --> 31:04.029
but at this very moment,
your fiancé David Larrabee...

31:04.113 --> 31:05.739
[David] Is late, as usual.

31:05.823 --> 31:09.159
[woman] [laughs] No problem.
Hi, how can I help you?

31:10.494 --> 31:12.413
[David] Hello, everybody.
Hello, darling.

31:12.496 --> 31:14.790
Huzzah. Cherry Coke.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.418
- Thank you so much.
- For you. No problem.

31:17.501 --> 31:20.379
[David] I heard there was
a board meeting going on.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.798
- How is it?
- It's good.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.258
[Elizabeth] Sabrina?
Who's Sabrina?

31:24.341 --> 31:26.385
[Oliver] That name, that name.

31:26.468 --> 31:28.220
[David] She's on the boat,
I guess.

yeah, you know,

31:38.606 --> 31:40.024
Don't stay up too late.

31:40.107 --> 31:41.525
You've got work early
in the morning tomorrow.

31:41.609 --> 31:42.943
All right, Mom. Promise.

31:50.409 --> 31:53.662
[door creaks]

32:12.598 --> 32:15.184
Had a really good time tonight.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.685
Did you, also?

32:16.769 --> 32:18.896
[laughing] Yeah.
No, I had a really...

32:18.979 --> 32:20.522
I had a really great time, yeah.

32:20.606 --> 32:24.026
I think I was just
dehydrated before.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.486
[laughs] Okay.

32:25.569 --> 32:28.739
Are you... hydrated now?
