03:23.412 --> 03:25.869
(cheers)

03:25.873 --> 03:28.239
(soft music)

03:31.754 --> 03:34.291
- You left me hanging in there.

03:37.510 --> 03:40.172
- I don't know how you stand
working with these people?

03:40.179 --> 03:41.919
- So are you gonna pay the mortgage?

03:49.563 --> 03:50.518
Happy New Year Jeff.

03:53.693 --> 03:54.648
- Come here.

This is our year Linds,
we're gonna make it happen.

04:12.128 --> 04:13.868
- That was our resolution last year.

04:14.922 --> 04:18.255
- Trust me, this is the one.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.515
- [Lindsey] Cops will be out.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.851
- [Jeff] I got it, wait, don't we need

04:30.855 --> 04:32.516
to pick up your sister?

04:32.523 --> 04:35.481
- [Lindsey] When I dropped her
off she said shed get a ride.

04:35.484 --> 04:36.894
- [Jeff] I bet she will.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.120
I didn't want to tell
you before the party,

04:54.128 --> 04:56.961
but I caught her going
through our closet earlier.

04:56.964 --> 04:57.953
- [Lindsey] I think she
left most of her clothes

04:57.965 --> 04:59.000
in your room.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.797
- [Jeff] She was weird about it.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.012
- [Lindsey] That's just how she is,

05:07.016 --> 05:09.598
did you think about the offer?

05:09.602 --> 05:11.342
- [Jeff] Yeah.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.264
- And?

05:13.272 --> 05:15.103
- I'll be done by April.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.098
- It's been eight months I'm sick

05:17.109 --> 05:18.690
of living in a construction zone.

05:20.029 --> 05:21.860
- I'm on top of it Linds.

05:21.864 --> 05:24.230
(soft music)

05:39.882 --> 05:41.418
- What are you doing?

05:41.425 --> 05:42.210
- Nothing.

05:43.177 --> 05:43.962
- Stop.

05:46.055 --> 05:48.546
- What happened to that
girl I fell in love with?

05:48.557 --> 05:52.391
The one that knew how to
live a little, remember her?

05:52.394 --> 05:53.224
- Jeff!

05:53.229 --> 05:54.059
(dramatic music)

05:54.063 --> 05:55.052
(grass breaking)

05:55.064 --> 05:57.851
(tires squealing)

05:59.401 --> 06:02.438
(gasping for breath)

06:09.203 --> 06:09.988
Oh my God.

06:17.253 --> 06:18.538
What did you do?

06:20.714 --> 06:23.421
(dramatic music)

06:31.559 --> 06:32.389
(choking)

06:32.393 --> 06:34.429
- [Jeff] Hey, hey, can
you hear me brother?

06:34.436 --> 06:35.266
Can you hear me?

06:35.271 --> 06:36.386
(gasping)

06:36.397 --> 06:37.182
Hey.

06:39.024 --> 06:39.979
Call 911.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.309
Lindsey grab your phone!

06:48.909 --> 06:50.024
Hey you're gonna be alright, alright?

06:50.035 --> 06:52.617
We got people coming for you, we're gonna,

06:52.621 --> 06:53.451
just hang in there man.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.070
- There's no reception!

06:55.082 --> 06:57.789
(dramatic music)

07:01.171 --> 07:02.377
(choking)

07:02.381 --> 07:05.873
- [Jeff] Grab his legs, we
got to take him ourselves.

07:05.885 --> 07:07.125
(groans)

07:07.136 --> 07:08.376
(yeHs)

07:08.387 --> 07:09.843
- Okay, I got him.

07:15.519 --> 07:16.804
- Open the door.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.274
(groaning)

07:29.074 --> 07:29.938
- [Lindsey] Use this.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.501
- Oh Jesus Christ, he's seizing.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.793
What do we do?

07:47.801 --> 07:48.756
- Talk to him.

07:48.761 --> 07:50.217
- Okay.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.508
Don't go towards the light,
you've got stuff to live for,

07:53.515 --> 07:54.641
lots of stuff.

07:58.479 --> 07:59.264
Hey.

08:00.689 --> 08:01.849
(dramatic music)

08:01.857 --> 08:06.692
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
man, can you hear me man?

08:08.489 --> 08:09.274
Hey buddy.

08:13.619 --> 08:14.608
He stopped breathing.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.450
- Are you sure?

08:19.458 --> 08:20.698
- I don't fucking know!

08:20.709 --> 08:21.824
- Check his pulse.

08:35.224 --> 08:36.009
- Nothing.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.929
(dramatic music)

08:43.774 --> 08:44.559
He's gone.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.111
- Okay.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.192
How much did you have to drink?

08:53.492 --> 08:54.447
- I wasn't counting.

08:56.829 --> 08:58.239
We could say you were driving.

08:58.247 --> 08:59.737
- I had three glasses of wine.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.957
(dramatic music)

09:05.587 --> 09:07.543
- Left, go left.

09:08.841 --> 09:10.047
Go back to the house.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.381
- The hospital's in the other direction.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.215
- Just do it.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.379
- Jeff we can't.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.172
- We can't stay here!

09:16.849 --> 09:18.931
We're gonna take him in I promise, we just

09:20.686 --> 09:23.803
need someplace where we
can think about this.

09:23.814 --> 09:24.678
Figure things out.

09:26.025 --> 09:28.391
(soft music)

10:11.070 --> 10:12.935
There's nothing that we could've done.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.983
Two hours, that's all we need.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.074
- [Lindsey] For what?

10:23.082 --> 10:26.165
- Sober up, then we'll
drop him off at the ER,

10:26.168 --> 10:27.248
pretend like it just happened.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.241
- [Lindsey] Whoa, whoa,
no, no, no, I don't think.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.288
- I'll do the talking.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.416
- Two hours.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.541
- [Jeff] Yeah, that's it,
then we'll drop him off.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.461
Why don't you change out of that dress.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.695
Lindsey, come here.

11:07.793 --> 11:10.705
(dramatic music)

11:10.712 --> 11:12.498
It's probably sitting right on the road.

11:12.506 --> 11:13.871
- [Lindsey] We have to call the police.

11:13.882 --> 11:14.712
- [Jeff] I have to go back.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.217
- [Lindsey] No, no, wait Jeff!

11:16.218 --> 11:17.207
Please don't leave me.

11:17.219 --> 11:18.459
- I'll be back in 10 minutes,
I'll be back in 10 minutes,

11:18.470 --> 11:20.461
you'll be fine, close the door behind me.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.304
- [Lindsey] But your shirt.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.688
- [Jeff] Hand me a clean one.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.564
(dramatic music)

12:38.842 --> 12:41.424
(clock chiming)

13:35.148 --> 13:37.855
(dramatic music)

14:20.569 --> 14:22.560
- That felt good, thanks.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.356
- So we go inside or what?

14:30.162 --> 14:34.496
- You were doing so well, a
couple of good pick up lines.

14:34.499 --> 14:38.663
A ride on the open road, not
desperate, but not aloof.

14:39.713 --> 14:40.748
- So what do you say?

14:42.883 --> 14:44.794
- A guy I knew used to say
that people are either wolves

14:44.801 --> 14:46.587
or wolves in sheep's clothing.

14:46.595 --> 14:47.550
- So, which are you?

14:50.932 --> 14:52.217
- [Hannah] Happy New Years.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.550
- [Man] Happy New Year.

15:33.308 --> 15:34.093
- Lindsey?

15:35.936 --> 15:36.766
Jeff?

15:46.113 --> 15:48.320
(creaking)

15:48.323 --> 15:50.439
(clatter)

16:41.084 --> 16:44.076
(yelling)

16:44.087 --> 16:44.872
Let me go!

16:45.755 --> 16:48.462
(dramatic music)

16:53.805 --> 16:55.420
My sister's calling the police right now.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.639
My brother in law's getting his gun.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.976
I'm warning you this is your last chance.

17:05.984 --> 17:08.691
(dramatic music)

17:10.655 --> 17:12.646
(yelling)

17:12.657 --> 17:15.649
(dramatic music)

17:15.660 --> 17:17.776
(yelling)

17:23.376 --> 17:25.867
(dramatic music)

17:25.879 --> 17:28.086
(gun shot)

17:30.884 --> 17:32.966
(dramatic music)

17:32.969 --> 17:35.176
(gun shot)

17:37.098 --> 17:38.258
- [Jeff] What the fuck was that?

17:38.266 --> 17:40.723
- [Lindsey] It came from the
garage, I thought it was you.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.434
(dramatic music)

17:53.657 --> 17:54.942
- [Jeff] Hannah?

17:54.950 --> 17:56.065
Hannah, whoa, whoa Hannah!

17:56.076 --> 17:57.566
- [Lindsey] Hannah stop, let go.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.862
(yelling)

17:58.870 --> 18:00.246
Hannah, Hannah!

18:00.247 --> 18:01.862
Hannah, Hannah!

18:01.873 --> 18:03.534
It's us, it's me, it's me.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.078
(crying)

18:05.085 --> 18:06.200
Hannah, I'm not gonna hurt you.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.200
- [Jeff] Shut up, shut up.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.173
- [Hannah] Don't go in
there Jeff, don't go!

18:14.177 --> 18:15.462
- [Lindsey] Shh.

18:17.514 --> 18:20.221
(dramatic music)

18:34.573 --> 18:36.564
(dramatic music)

18:36.575 --> 18:38.657
(crying)

18:38.660 --> 18:41.197
- What did I do, what did I do?

18:43.707 --> 18:45.368
- Hannah I got to get your shoes off okay?

18:45.375 --> 18:47.036
(talking)

18:47.043 --> 18:48.203
Sweetheart, we're not calling the police.

18:48.211 --> 18:49.587
- [Hannah] Why not?

18:49.588 --> 18:52.705
- Jeff hit him

18:52.716 --> 18:54.081
- What?

18:54.092 --> 18:58.586
- It was an accident, we
were trying to help okay.

18:58.597 --> 19:00.178
I know sweetheart.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.092
(crying)

19:02.100 --> 19:05.012
I'm gonna get you in the
shower, come on Hannah.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.056
(crying)

19:25.874 --> 19:27.114
- [Jeff] What's the deal?

19:27.125 --> 19:28.786
- She took two Ambien.

19:38.762 --> 19:43.677
- When I went back there was
a police car in the road,

19:43.683 --> 19:45.184
where we hit him.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.049
- I'm calling Bob Graham.

19:46.061 --> 19:48.222
- [Jeff] A lawyer's more likely
to turn us in than help us.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.059
- This isn't Goodfellas Jeff.

19:49.064 --> 19:51.726
- You make that call, what do you

19:51.733 --> 19:53.018
think's gonna happen to me?

19:56.571 --> 19:57.606
Or your sister?

20:03.244 --> 20:04.029
Look,

20:06.331 --> 20:09.619
you do what you have to do,
but I'm gonna go in there,

20:09.626 --> 20:11.332
and I'm gonna find out who this guy is

20:11.336 --> 20:12.792
before we do something stupid.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.806
(gasps)

20:38.780 --> 20:41.613
- [Lindsey] Oh God, please
don't be so rough with him.

20:41.616 --> 20:42.571
- [Jeff] Here we go.

20:53.211 --> 20:53.961
Wait.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.249
(dramatic music)

21:01.261 --> 21:02.046
- [Lindsey] What?

21:10.145 --> 21:11.726
(dramatic music)

21:11.730 --> 21:16.690
- That's our address,
he was on his way here.

21:17.026 --> 21:19.733
(dramatic music)

21:31.499 --> 21:32.955
Is there anything you've done?

21:34.627 --> 21:39.542
Any reason you can think
of that would make someone

21:40.133 --> 21:42.840
come after you, because
if there is, now would

21:42.844 --> 21:43.674
be the time.

21:43.678 --> 21:44.508
- How can you even ask me that?

21:44.512 --> 21:45.592
- [Jeff] You work at the bank.

21:45.597 --> 21:46.461
- I'm a loan officer.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.303
- So there's money.

21:47.307 --> 21:48.137
- You should've been watching the road!

21:48.141 --> 21:49.722
- Forgive me for trying to
spice things up a little bit.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.717
Maybe if you weren't always
at work letting Crisco

21:51.728 --> 21:52.638
walk all over you.

21:53.772 --> 21:54.807
- My job is the only thing
keeping us in this house,

21:54.814 --> 21:55.769
how do you think that makes me feel?

21:55.774 --> 21:57.514
- You don't seem to mind.

21:57.525 --> 21:58.480
- Yeah, well you don't seem to mind

21:58.485 --> 21:59.895
sitting on your ass all day.

22:00.862 --> 22:03.569
(dramatic music)

22:05.700 --> 22:08.442
- If the cops found the
license plate they could

22:08.453 --> 22:09.408
be here any minute.

22:13.917 --> 22:14.702
Hey.

22:15.794 --> 22:18.501
(dramatic music)

22:22.509 --> 22:26.752
We're gonna make it through this, okay?

22:28.306 --> 22:30.763
But I need you to trust me.

22:33.394 --> 22:34.725
- I can't, I can't.

22:34.729 --> 22:35.514
- Yes you can.

22:38.733 --> 22:42.851
If the cops come we're gonna
tell them that we hit a deer.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.824
We have to do something
about this mess though.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.750
(dramatic music)

23:35.665 --> 23:37.075
Back there we'll deal with it later.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.665
- Him, we'll deal with him later.

23:39.669 --> 23:42.376
(dramatic music)

24:07.780 --> 24:09.111
- [Jeff] You know what this reminds me of?

24:09.115 --> 24:09.900
- [Lindsey] What?

24:11.242 --> 24:13.574
- That shit hole apartment
we had after college.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.327
Cleaning it after we moved in.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.164
Those brushes my mom gave us,

24:21.044 --> 24:22.705
trying not to gag on the bleach.

24:24.213 --> 24:25.248
God it's so damn hot.

24:25.256 --> 24:26.632
- Shut up Jeff.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.668
- [Jeff] Yeah.

24:27.675 --> 24:30.382
(dramatic music)

25:28.027 --> 25:29.312
What time is it?

25:29.320 --> 25:31.697
- Almost 8:00 I think.

25:34.117 --> 25:36.358
- I could use a little
coffee if you don't mind.

25:39.080 --> 25:39.865
- Sure.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.431
(doorbell)

26:11.446 --> 26:13.653
(knocking)

26:18.911 --> 26:20.037
Morning officers.

26:20.038 --> 26:22.450
- Happy New Year ma'am,
sorry to bother you so early.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.743
- Oh I'm an early riser.

26:24.751 --> 26:28.369
- I'm Officer Varone,
this is Officer Campbell.

26:28.379 --> 26:31.291
You Lindsey Pittman, your
husband Jeff Pittman?

26:31.299 --> 26:32.129
- That's right.

26:32.133 --> 26:35.170
- I wondered who bought the old
place after Ms. Dana passed.

26:35.178 --> 26:37.635
- It's a real fixer upper
but we're getting there.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.131
- [Officer Varone] You out
late last night Mrs. Pittman?

26:41.142 --> 26:43.007
- Not especially, we had a work event.

26:45.021 --> 26:47.683
- Anything unusual
happen on the drive home?

26:47.690 --> 26:48.850
- No, not that I can think of.

26:48.858 --> 26:50.314
- Did you or your husband
have anything to drink ma'am?

26:50.318 --> 26:53.355
- Oh no, we don't drink and drive.

26:53.362 --> 26:54.522
- Any car trouble?

26:54.530 --> 26:56.145
- Why would there be car trouble?

26:59.410 --> 27:00.399
Oh the doe.

27:00.411 --> 27:01.241
- [Officer] Pardon?

27:01.245 --> 27:02.826
- The deer, we hit a deer.

27:07.126 --> 27:10.914
Oh thank you, it must've
fallen off during the accident.

27:12.924 --> 27:14.209
- Was it okay?

27:14.217 --> 27:17.755
- Yeah, well no, the windshield's broken,

27:17.762 --> 27:21.095
and the bumper has you
know, some dents in it.

27:21.099 --> 27:24.432
- I meant the deer, there
was some blood in the road.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.050
- Oh, poor little thing.

27:27.063 --> 27:30.555
She twitched a couple
times and then ran off.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.102
- Can we see?

27:32.110 --> 27:34.601
(police scanner)

27:34.612 --> 27:36.694
- Well she ran off like I said.

27:39.784 --> 27:40.614
So there's no body here officer.

27:40.618 --> 27:43.200
- He meant the car Mrs.
Pittman, we'd like to see it.

27:44.413 --> 27:45.539
- Is there a problem?

27:45.540 --> 27:48.532
- No, we'd just like to see it.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.838
- Hey Linds, we're gonna
need some more bleach

27:52.839 --> 27:54.249
to cover up the rest of this.

27:58.553 --> 27:59.884
Good morning officers.

27:59.887 --> 28:01.468
- [Officers] Good morning.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.008
- These gentlemen want to see the damage

28:03.015 --> 28:04.266
from the deer we hit.

28:04.267 --> 28:05.882
Found this.

28:05.893 --> 28:08.350
- [Jeff] Oh yeah, the deer.

28:09.856 --> 28:12.768
You know what they say, you
don't really hit a deer,

28:12.775 --> 28:13.560
deer hits you.

28:14.485 --> 28:15.395
- Is that what they say?

28:20.575 --> 28:23.863
- It was a big sucker
must've been about a four,

28:23.870 --> 28:25.326
five pointer.

28:26.414 --> 28:27.620
- Wife said it was a doe.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.495
- [Jeff] Buck, fawn, doe,
Lindsey knows as much

28:32.503 --> 28:34.414
about deer as I know about nail polish.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.926
(dramatic music)

28:44.891 --> 28:47.098
- Oh, we're donating
some clothes to charity.

28:49.187 --> 28:50.677
- Is that so?

28:50.688 --> 28:53.805
Good for you, 'tis the season.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.852
(laughs)

28:59.322 --> 29:02.029
(dramatic music)

29:04.869 --> 29:06.359
- Can I offer you some coffee?

29:08.414 --> 29:10.780
- No thank you ma'am,
caffeine keeps me up.

29:14.754 --> 29:18.042
- How fast were you traveling
when you hit the animal?

29:18.049 --> 29:20.131
- About 35 miles per hour.

29:21.802 --> 29:22.928
- 45 zone.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.647
- Can I ask what this is all about?

29:33.648 --> 29:36.481
- Well we got a lot of calls
last night, more than usual.

29:39.987 --> 29:40.817
Noise complaints, people
seeing things, even found

29:40.821 --> 29:43.483
a broken down car on route
four, about a mile from here.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.698
Not far from where you hit the deer.

29:45.701 --> 29:48.818
- [Officer Campbell] Alternator
was busted, no registration,

29:48.829 --> 29:49.659
no plates.

29:49.664 --> 29:51.074
- Like I said, strange night.

29:53.709 --> 29:56.246
- We heard some fireworks at around 1:00,

29:56.254 --> 29:58.085
we just assumed it was
some neighborhood kids.

29:58.089 --> 30:00.045
- Yeah, it happens every year.

30:00.049 --> 30:02.131
- Well you've got a problem Mr. Pittman.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.045
(dramatic music)

30:04.053 --> 30:05.839
- What's that?

30:05.846 --> 30:07.677
- See you driving around
with this, we're gonna

30:07.682 --> 30:08.717
have to write you up.

30:11.811 --> 30:16.054
- Of course, yeah we'll
get it fixed today.

30:16.065 --> 30:17.726
- It's a holiday.

30:17.733 --> 30:18.722
(scoffs)

30:18.734 --> 30:21.066
- Yeah, tomorrow then.

30:21.946 --> 30:24.437
(police scanner)

30:24.448 --> 30:27.030
- Well, thank you for
stopping by, Happy New Year.

30:27.034 --> 30:29.821
- [Hannah] Lindsey do you
have anymore conditioner?

30:29.829 --> 30:32.320
- It's in the cabinet next to the sink.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.616
- [Varone] Were you in
the car as well ma'am?

30:33.624 --> 30:34.454
- The car?

30:34.458 --> 30:35.959
No I was in the garage,
that's where it happened.

30:35.960 --> 30:36.790
- My sister.

30:36.794 --> 30:37.579
- Let her answer.

30:38.629 --> 30:40.745
What exactly happened in the garage?

30:40.756 --> 30:43.463
(dramatic music)

30:47.680 --> 30:51.093
- I'm sorry, I just woke
up, I'm a little confused,

30:51.100 --> 30:52.306
what's going on?

30:52.310 --> 30:55.017
(police scanner)

30:56.188 --> 30:58.270
- 10-4, 22 responding.

30:58.274 --> 31:00.060
It's alright ma'am, go back to sleep.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.056
- She's going through a
breakup, I think she had

31:01.068 --> 31:02.478
too much to drink last night.

31:03.404 --> 31:04.814
- And one more thing Ms. Pittman.

31:04.822 --> 31:09.191
Tell your husband to open the
garage, those fumes are toxic.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.032
- I will, thank you officer.

31:20.713 --> 31:22.249
Okay, they're gone.

31:27.636 --> 31:28.466
- I didn't say anything.

31:28.471 --> 31:30.007
- You said enough, I'm
trying to protect us

31:30.014 --> 31:33.006
and you're screwing it up.

31:33.017 --> 31:33.847
- [Lindsey] Jeff.

31:33.851 --> 31:34.636
How was I supposed to know?

31:34.643 --> 31:35.473
You're the one who brought him here.

31:35.478 --> 31:36.968
- You pasted his brains
all over the floor.

31:36.979 --> 31:37.968
- Alright, she's been enough.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.686
- [Hannah] I thought you called 'em,

31:39.690 --> 31:40.896
Lindsey please tell him.

31:40.900 --> 31:41.730
- I should turn you in
they'd probably think me.

31:41.734 --> 31:42.974
- I so sorry this is all my fault.

31:42.985 --> 31:44.316
- No it's not.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.480
- Oh come on.

31:45.488 --> 31:46.273
- I didn't know they'd come after me.

31:48.324 --> 31:49.780
- What did you say?

31:49.784 --> 31:51.615
- I didn't mean to, you have to call them.

31:51.619 --> 31:52.779
- [Jeff] I knew it.

31:52.787 --> 31:53.572
- I'll handle this.

31:56.457 --> 31:57.242
Who's after you?

32:00.586 --> 32:03.202
- For the first three
months we dated I thought

32:03.214 --> 32:08.174
he owned a juice shop, some
organic, vegan bullshit.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.593
- The man in the garage
that's who you ran away from?

32:11.597 --> 32:13.007
- No, I've never seen him before.

32:13.015 --> 32:13.925
- Then who is he?

32:13.933 --> 32:14.718
- I don't know.

32:17.353 --> 32:22.313
Richard, my boyfriend, his
real business is stocks.

32:23.651 --> 32:25.687
They took money from old
people and never actually

32:25.694 --> 32:28.527
invested it anywhere, they,
just kept it and sent out

32:28.531 --> 32:31.238
fake statements like Bernie Madoff.

32:31.242 --> 32:32.903
- Un-fucking believable.

32:32.910 --> 32:34.195
- Like you're a model citizen.

32:34.203 --> 32:35.864
- Why would Richard come after you?

32:35.871 --> 32:37.486
- He wouldn't.

32:37.498 --> 32:38.533
- He's a criminal.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.327
- He wouldn't.

32:40.334 --> 32:41.119
He's dead.

32:42.253 --> 32:43.743
His partner killed him.

32:43.754 --> 32:46.336
- You told me you left
because he hurt you.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.706
(soft music)

32:50.094 --> 32:53.552
- I was just scared you
wouldn't let me stay.

32:53.556 --> 32:56.514
I don't know why they
sent that man after me.

32:56.517 --> 32:57.973
- What happened?

32:57.977 --> 33:00.764
- Richard was nervous about a handoff.

33:00.771 --> 33:05.231
I came home one afternoon
and the whole apartment

33:05.234 --> 33:07.646
had been ransacked, there
was blood everywhere.

33:09.864 --> 33:11.695
He told me that if
something happened to him

33:11.699 --> 33:13.735
I should go somewhere
safe, so I grabbed a bag

33:13.742 --> 33:14.527
and I came here.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.531
- What bag?

33:17.538 --> 33:19.904
(soft music)

33:31.635 --> 33:32.841
What's this?

33:32.845 --> 33:34.961
- An Indian good luck charm,

33:37.099 --> 33:39.340
Richard was into stuff like that.

33:39.351 --> 33:44.266
Gave me this, said it kept him
centered whatever that means.

33:44.273 --> 33:46.980
(dramatic music)

33:53.991 --> 33:57.279
- It's a claim slip from Crandall Lodge.

33:59.580 --> 34:00.695
- Did you know about this?

34:00.706 --> 34:02.947
- No, I swear.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.414
- Ronnie and Joan had
their anniversary there,

34:04.418 --> 34:07.285
it's a bed and breakfast
way out in the boonies.

34:07.296 --> 34:08.752
- [Jeff] I'll go grab the keys.

34:08.756 --> 34:09.962
- Let me go with you.

34:09.965 --> 34:11.375
- Not a chance.

34:11.383 --> 34:12.293
- I'm sorry.

34:12.301 --> 34:13.416
- Fine, what do you
want me to tell the cops

34:13.427 --> 34:14.212
if they show up again?

34:22.353 --> 34:23.934
Or would you rather handle that?

34:32.821 --> 34:37.781
I meant to thank you for
the phone and the boots,

34:40.746 --> 34:42.782
it's been a long time
since I had a Christmas

34:42.790 --> 34:43.745
with a tree and all.

34:48.879 --> 34:50.835
You know we have something in common.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.295
- [Jeff] Doubt that.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.968
- We both know what it's like
to live in Lindsey's shadow.

35:00.975 --> 35:03.341
- [DJ] With an arctic blast
rolling in later tonight,

35:03.352 --> 35:04.341
dropping down to 15.

35:07.982 --> 35:10.644
(dramatic music)

35:31.213 --> 35:33.420
(doorbell)

35:39.346 --> 35:42.053
(dramatic music)

35:47.104 --> 35:49.311
(doorbell)

36:01.368 --> 36:04.610
- Good morning, I guess it's afternoon,

36:04.622 --> 36:06.988
you must be, Lindsey Pittman?

36:08.334 --> 36:09.915
- Can I help you?

36:09.918 --> 36:12.625
- Yes, I am Detective Smith,

36:13.797 --> 36:15.253
is your husband home by any chance?

36:15.257 --> 36:16.212
- He had to run out.

36:17.092 --> 36:17.877
- Oh.

36:20.721 --> 36:22.507
Do you mind if I come in,
I got a couple of questions

36:22.514 --> 36:23.344
I got to ask you.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.715
- I talked to your friends this morning,

36:25.726 --> 36:26.681
I told them everything.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.971
- Oh, it shouldn't take
long at all, I promise.

36:32.191 --> 36:33.931
- Okay, what would you like to know?

36:34.902 --> 36:38.019
- Okay, to be honest,
I was kinda hoping for

36:38.030 --> 36:40.737
a cup of coffee while we talk.

36:40.741 --> 36:43.027
It's been a long night,
New Year's Eve and all.

36:53.754 --> 36:56.461
(dramatic music)

37:00.260 --> 37:01.170
- Should I say anything, or should

37:01.178 --> 37:02.759
I just slide it across the counter?

37:02.763 --> 37:03.878
- Let me have it Jeff.

37:03.889 --> 37:06.175
- You don't think I can handle it?

37:06.183 --> 37:10.552
- I know how to talk to these
people, this is my fault,

37:10.562 --> 37:11.688
let me make it right.

37:16.068 --> 37:17.353
We can tell her it was you.

37:18.278 --> 37:21.270
I'll even embellish the
story, you'll be the big hero.

37:32.501 --> 37:36.790
- It is your fault, don't screw it up.

37:38.132 --> 37:39.963
- [Hannah] I'll be back
before you can count to three.

37:51.311 --> 37:53.472
- So do you have more
important things to do?

37:54.565 --> 37:57.227
- Yeah, it's just paperwork really.

37:57.234 --> 38:00.772
Bean counters want to make sure
we follow up on every lead.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.065
- Lead, we hit a deer.

38:04.408 --> 38:06.774
- I meant incident
report, got to make sure

38:06.785 --> 38:08.696
the foot soldiers didn't miss anything.

38:11.081 --> 38:13.868
So you said your husband is out?

38:13.876 --> 38:15.082
- He's running an errand.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.878
- New Year's day, must be pretty urgent.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.165
- Odds and ends.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.431
Do you mind?

38:34.271 --> 38:35.636
- No, have at it.

38:45.908 --> 38:47.364
Now about the deer.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.533
- Like we told them this morning it was

38:50.537 --> 38:52.744
a four or five point buck.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.739
I guess it knocked the license plate off.

38:58.212 --> 38:59.497
- Dulls the blades right?

38:59.505 --> 39:00.620
- Should tell my sister.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.671
- I had the same problem with my ex.

39:05.803 --> 39:10.547
Lindsey, I'm sorry, do you
mind if I call you Lindsey?

39:10.557 --> 39:11.342
- Sure.

39:14.228 --> 39:15.809
- Does your sister live with you?

39:17.064 --> 39:18.270
- Temporarily.

39:18.273 --> 39:19.433
- Is she here right now?

39:21.568 --> 39:24.059
- She's with my husband,
but she wasn't in the car.

39:30.077 --> 39:31.613
- I was always jealous
of families that spend

39:31.620 --> 39:34.453
the holidays together,
never happened with mine.

39:37.125 --> 39:40.253
My dad walked out when I
was seven, and my mom drank

39:40.254 --> 39:41.960
herself to death a few years later.

39:43.841 --> 39:45.877
- I'm sorry, that's terrible.

39:45.884 --> 39:49.468
- Oh no, no, no, no,
it was for the better.

39:50.806 --> 39:52.637
What doesn't kill you and all, right?

39:58.188 --> 40:02.181
My partner says I talk
too much, probably true.

40:06.530 --> 40:09.146
(water boiling)

40:13.370 --> 40:14.701
I think the coffee's ready.

40:36.810 --> 40:37.970
My opinion there's nothing

40:37.978 --> 40:39.684
a little hair of the dog can't fix.

40:47.446 --> 40:50.734
Mm, that hits the spot, nice and strong.

40:52.951 --> 40:53.781
Thank you Lindsey.

40:57.706 --> 40:59.412
Now where's the body?

41:03.670 --> 41:05.706
- It wasn't dead it leapt into the woods.

41:08.508 --> 41:11.090
- One minute you're alive and then boom!

41:12.471 --> 41:13.836
Dead as a doornail.

41:19.353 --> 41:21.935
- Detective, where's your partner?

41:23.065 --> 41:25.147
- He's running an errand, you know?

41:25.150 --> 41:26.936
Odds and ends.

41:26.944 --> 41:29.606
(dramatic music)

41:34.826 --> 41:35.986
Do you have any creamer?

41:36.995 --> 41:39.702
(dramatic music)

42:06.108 --> 42:08.315
(rumbling)

42:26.044 --> 42:28.751
(dramatic music)

43:07.961 --> 43:09.497
- I didn't open it.

43:11.882 --> 43:12.667
- Oh shit.

43:14.468 --> 43:17.175
(dramatic music)

43:23.518 --> 43:25.554
This is, this is $50,000.

43:32.819 --> 43:35.196
$50,000 fucking dollars, yes!

43:38.950 --> 43:40.986
- Merry Christmas.

43:40.994 --> 43:43.451
- Lindsey barely makes
this much in a year.

43:43.455 --> 43:45.070
And that's before taxes.

43:45.082 --> 43:46.413
- I get it.

43:46.416 --> 43:47.201
- No.

43:48.085 --> 43:48.915
- I really do.

43:48.919 --> 43:49.704
- You really don't.

43:51.088 --> 43:52.624
She wanted to go to
Cozumel for our honeymoon

43:52.631 --> 43:55.338
we ended up at some
Radisson, Daytona Beach.

43:55.342 --> 43:57.708
The breakfast buffet wasn't even included.

43:57.719 --> 44:02.679
I mean this, this is the
break we've been waiting for.

44:05.310 --> 44:07.301
We can finally get our heads above water.

44:11.066 --> 44:14.024
- Even if that bag had a million dollars

44:14.027 --> 44:16.609
it wouldn't fix anything.

44:16.613 --> 44:19.605
- She has me on an
allowance for Christ sake.

44:20.826 --> 44:21.690
- Still true.

44:23.036 --> 44:25.743
(dramatic music)

45:27.893 --> 45:29.008
- Boo.

45:29.019 --> 45:31.635
(crying)

45:31.646 --> 45:33.853
(laughing)

45:40.655 --> 45:43.818
My ex used to cry all the time, made me

45:43.825 --> 45:45.406
want to strangle her.

45:46.745 --> 45:49.452
(dramatic music)

46:00.592 --> 46:02.708
Better, thank you.

46:06.306 --> 46:08.547
Look, I know what you're thinking.

46:09.893 --> 46:13.511
You're gonna hold out, not
gonna talk, protect your family

46:13.521 --> 46:16.058
blah, blah, blah, it's
all very noble of you.

46:16.066 --> 46:18.603
But I have to tell you that now

46:18.610 --> 46:20.396
is not the time for nobility.

46:20.403 --> 46:22.610
(groaning)

46:26.534 --> 46:30.402
Some people say the blood
tastes sour like aluminum.

46:30.413 --> 46:33.576
The hemo, well it's actually
the iron in the hemoglobin

46:33.583 --> 46:37.451
to be more precise, some
people say it tastes sweet,

46:37.462 --> 46:42.422
I bet that's the glucose,
sweet or sour, it must

46:42.884 --> 46:46.297
be something genetic, but
I also wondered if somehow

46:46.304 --> 46:49.842
it was connected to personalities,
like an astrological sign

46:49.849 --> 46:52.932
or something, I'm a Scorpio by the way.

46:52.936 --> 46:55.143
My astrologist says that we
like to get to the bottom

46:55.146 --> 46:56.886
of things, which brings me to my point,

46:56.898 --> 46:59.685
I could do this all day.

46:59.693 --> 47:02.685
I could, eventually your
lips are gonna begin

47:02.696 --> 47:04.357
to flame, at some point
your teeth are just gonna

47:04.364 --> 47:07.231
pop right through them and pardon the pun,

47:07.242 --> 47:10.279
but I'm sure your smile is
a real asset at the bank.

47:11.621 --> 47:13.703
Wouldn't want to ruin that now would we.

47:13.707 --> 47:15.789
(gasping)

47:28.513 --> 47:29.878
Where's the body?

47:30.974 --> 47:33.135
- In the garage, we hit
it with the car and then

47:33.143 --> 47:35.350
he attacked my sister,
please you can tell.

47:35.353 --> 47:40.017
- Shh, shh, oh you must be a Capricorn,

47:40.025 --> 47:42.892
so honest and forthcoming.

47:42.902 --> 47:44.858
There's a flip side to that you know?

47:44.863 --> 47:47.400
Capricorns they get taken advantage of.

47:47.407 --> 47:50.570
Long hours at the bank, boss copping

47:50.577 --> 47:53.114
a feel when no one's looking.

47:53.121 --> 47:55.533
And then it's home to Jeff, Jeff,

47:55.540 --> 47:59.328
yeah I read about his going
to the college World Series,

48:00.420 --> 48:01.785
ouch, blowing the lead at
the bottom of the ninth.

48:01.796 --> 48:02.626
That's rough.

48:05.842 --> 48:09.630
Riddle me this Lindsey,
how does someone like you,

48:09.637 --> 48:14.097
a born go getter, end up
with a testosterone filled

48:14.100 --> 48:16.352
choker like him?

48:17.687 --> 48:20.349
(dramatic music)

48:40.460 --> 48:42.701
Jerome, he's my therapist, he would have

48:42.712 --> 48:44.703
a field day dissecting you.

48:44.714 --> 48:47.501
All your fantasies about
white picket fences.

48:47.509 --> 48:49.716
The prayers that Jeff might turn a corner.

48:49.719 --> 48:53.211
The desperate desire to fix
your screwed up little sister.

48:53.223 --> 48:56.135
Sad truth is you'll always
be trapped by the same

48:56.142 --> 48:59.885
dysfunctional relationships
you try so hard to escape.

48:59.896 --> 49:02.603
(dramatic music)

49:03.817 --> 49:04.806
Cat got your tongue?

49:07.654 --> 49:08.985
- I didn't hear a question.

49:13.201 --> 49:14.065
- Where'd they go?

49:15.495 --> 49:19.283
- You know she didn't
tell me she had a sister

49:20.375 --> 49:24.584
until we'd been dating three months.

49:24.587 --> 49:26.794
- Is that supposed to hurt my feelings?

49:30.969 --> 49:34.427
- It wasn't that she was
ashamed, I don't know,

49:35.974 --> 49:37.555
maybe she was, she just.

49:37.559 --> 49:40.346
- Just say whatever it
is you're trying to say.

49:41.396 --> 49:42.476
- I'm not sure what she'll do when

49:42.480 --> 49:43.811
we tell her about the money.

49:49.195 --> 49:51.186
- I could ask nicely.

49:51.197 --> 49:53.904
(breathing hard)

49:56.995 --> 49:59.862
Pretty please with a cherry on top.

50:08.715 --> 50:12.082
- I think this might be too much for her.

50:14.137 --> 50:15.718
- You mean don't tell her?

50:21.603 --> 50:22.388
- No.

50:24.272 --> 50:27.435
No.

50:27.442 --> 50:32.152
I'd never do that to
Lindsey, you passed the test.

50:34.032 --> 50:36.739
(dramatic music)

50:45.752 --> 50:47.959
She's under a lot of pressure.

50:47.962 --> 50:50.669
(dramatic music)

51:07.357 --> 51:10.895
- Scorpio and Capricorn Lindsey,
there is always a spark.

51:11.819 --> 51:12.604
Do you feel it?

51:16.991 --> 51:17.821
'Cause I sure do.

51:28.878 --> 51:31.711
If you need anything just whistle.

51:38.721 --> 51:42.088
(whistling "Dixie Land")

52:13.172 --> 52:15.163
(scoffs)

52:26.936 --> 52:28.972
(crying)

53:36.673 --> 53:39.210
("Dixie Land")

53:43.304 --> 53:46.011
(dramatic music)

55:34.540 --> 55:35.325
- Bill?

55:37.418 --> 55:39.795
(soft music)

56:43.109 --> 56:43.894
- Honey.

56:44.819 --> 56:45.774
- [Lindsey] In here.

56:56.372 --> 56:57.953
- Hey Linds, whose car is that?

56:59.417 --> 57:00.907
- [Lindsey] You forgot to call.

57:04.714 --> 57:07.877
- We got it hun, 50 grand.

57:13.014 --> 57:14.094
Did you hear me?

57:14.098 --> 57:15.178
$50,000.

57:18.352 --> 57:19.137
- I heard you.

57:21.480 --> 57:23.220
- What happened?

57:23.232 --> 57:24.017
- Come on.

57:24.901 --> 57:27.608
(dramatic music)

57:41.542 --> 57:46.502
He happened, he showed
up right after you left.

57:48.507 --> 57:49.917
And he knows everything about us.

57:59.602 --> 58:01.092
What are you doing?

58:01.103 --> 58:02.138
- Softening him up.

58:02.146 --> 58:05.183
- Stop it, please.

58:07.985 --> 58:09.191
- Don't even look at her.

58:10.613 --> 58:12.945
Go back to your room, I'll handle this.

58:12.949 --> 58:14.064
Now!

58:14.075 --> 58:16.782
(dramatic music)

58:25.086 --> 58:26.872
Ready to talk asshole?

58:34.595 --> 58:35.926
Who else knows you're here?

58:38.265 --> 58:42.554
- Sweet, it tastes sweet.

58:44.271 --> 58:47.479
Nuh, nuh, nuh, here's a thought,

58:49.360 --> 58:50.645
let me talk to your sister.

58:51.904 --> 58:52.768
- [Lindsey] You send a man to kill

58:52.780 --> 58:54.896
her now you want to talk to her?

58:54.907 --> 58:57.273
- Either we settle this
like civilized beings

58:57.284 --> 59:00.902
or someone else dies, maybe you, maybe me.

59:02.581 --> 59:04.037
No offense but she
doesn't look like the type

59:04.041 --> 59:05.906
to chop off my balls and shove 'em

59:05.918 --> 59:07.203
down my throat now does she?

59:07.211 --> 59:08.200
She might listen.

59:12.550 --> 59:13.835
- We'd be right here.

59:13.843 --> 59:15.299
- No, no, alone.

59:15.302 --> 59:16.428
- Not a chance in hell.

59:18.389 --> 59:21.472
- Come on slugger, you
don't want me to tell her

59:21.475 --> 59:23.636
about the stash of Asian schoolgirl porn

59:23.644 --> 59:24.759
you got in the cabinet.

59:28.149 --> 59:32.188
- [Lindsey] You're not
getting anywhere, come on.

59:34.321 --> 59:37.313
- It's like baseball Jeff,
sometimes you got to call

59:37.324 --> 59:40.691
in the relief pitcher, especially.

59:46.584 --> 59:48.120
- If there's porn in there he planted it.

59:48.127 --> 59:51.711
- I don't care, I'm gonna go get Hannah.

59:51.714 --> 59:53.045
- You're crazy leave her alone with him.

59:53.049 --> 59:54.880
- There's more to her than you think.

1:00:10.024 --> 1:00:11.560
He wants to talk to you.

1:00:11.567 --> 1:00:12.602
- Okay.

1:00:13.944 --> 1:00:14.899
- You don't have to.

1:00:15.905 --> 1:00:17.896
- I said I'd do it.

1:00:17.907 --> 1:00:18.692
- You sure?

1:00:20.910 --> 1:00:23.071
- You know what it was
like after you left?

1:00:26.373 --> 1:00:28.989
I saw mom with bad boyfriends before.

1:00:29.001 --> 1:00:31.208
- I can't apologize for leaving Hannah.

1:00:33.631 --> 1:00:34.746
- I didn't ask you to.

1:01:36.110 --> 1:01:38.066
I thought you were dead,

1:01:40.865 --> 1:01:42.105
there was so much blood.

1:01:42.116 --> 1:01:46.906
- No it's not mine babe,
not mine, I told you

1:01:46.912 --> 1:01:48.868
that we would always be together.

1:01:50.875 --> 1:01:54.743
- You're the reason that asshole left me.

1:01:54.753 --> 1:01:56.584
- I had to make sure you were safe, I was

1:01:56.589 --> 1:01:57.874
worried sick about you.

1:01:59.133 --> 1:02:00.748
Miss my little Hannah banana.

1:02:03.345 --> 1:02:04.209
- I missed you too.

1:02:08.017 --> 1:02:10.508
- Come here, starting to hurt.

1:02:15.816 --> 1:02:17.681
- Shouldn't have done that to her.

1:02:17.693 --> 1:02:19.900
- For Christ sakes I asked her for creamer

1:02:19.904 --> 1:02:21.644
and she came at me with
a butcher knife, I would

1:02:21.655 --> 1:02:23.611
never hurt your sister on purpose.

1:02:23.616 --> 1:02:26.323
(dramatic music)

1:02:31.707 --> 1:02:32.913
You get the money?

1:02:35.044 --> 1:02:35.829
- Yes.

1:02:37.129 --> 1:02:42.089
- Good, we're gonna go
to Europe, Australia,

1:02:42.843 --> 1:02:46.552
to see the pyramids, you
name it, just the two of us.

1:02:47.514 --> 1:02:50.972
(dramatic music)

1:02:50.976 --> 1:02:53.683
We can split it with them if you want.

1:02:53.687 --> 1:02:56.474
(dramatic music)

1:02:56.482 --> 1:02:58.768
- Does anyone else know you're here?

1:02:58.776 --> 1:03:01.438
- No babe, we got a one way ticket out.

1:03:05.407 --> 1:03:07.523
Baby, when you disappeared

1:03:10.704 --> 1:03:12.160
I realized how I felt,

1:03:15.501 --> 1:03:18.083
I couldn't say it before but, I love you.

1:03:27.763 --> 1:03:29.424
- I can't let you go right now.

1:03:29.431 --> 1:03:31.296
- Just think about this
for a goddam second.

1:03:31.308 --> 1:03:32.343
- Let me talk to them.

1:03:33.811 --> 1:03:35.802
I'll convince them you'll
be good to your word.

1:03:41.485 --> 1:03:42.315
- [Lindsey] How'd it go?

1:03:42.319 --> 1:03:44.560
- He said he'll split it
with us if we let him go.

1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:47.980
- [Lindsey] That's all he said.

1:03:47.992 --> 1:03:49.823
- [Hannah] I think he
means it, look we can't

1:03:49.827 --> 1:03:51.237
keep him tied up forever.

1:04:03.132 --> 1:04:04.372
- How can you be so naive?

1:04:05.592 --> 1:04:07.548
- You want to talk to me about naive?

1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:11.841
There is a dead man in
your garage and a live one

1:04:11.849 --> 1:04:13.840
in your basement, and you
are sitting there eating

1:04:13.851 --> 1:04:17.890
your peanut butter and
jelly sandwich dreaming

1:04:17.896 --> 1:04:20.228
about an island vacation.

1:04:23.944 --> 1:04:24.933
Fuck you Jeff.

1:04:25.863 --> 1:04:29.151
Fuck you and your $50,000.

1:04:45.924 --> 1:04:47.710
- He's just trying to keep us safe.

1:04:53.766 --> 1:04:54.801
What is it?

1:04:58.395 --> 1:05:00.135
It's okay, you can tell me.

1:05:05.402 --> 1:05:08.269
- When we were in the car,

1:05:10.783 --> 1:05:13.570
he tried to get me to say
that we didn't find anything.

1:05:15.913 --> 1:05:17.699
He wanted to hide the money from you.

1:05:19.124 --> 1:05:19.874
- You must've misunderstood what he meant.

1:05:21.001 --> 1:05:22.377
- I didn't.

1:05:22.378 --> 1:05:23.163
Lindsey.

1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:27.587
(dramatic music)

1:05:28.509 --> 1:05:29.294
Lindsey.

1:05:30.511 --> 1:05:32.126
- He wouldn't.

1:05:32.137 --> 1:05:34.844
(dramatic music)

1:06:04.336 --> 1:06:06.201
- You can't trust Jeff.

1:06:11.218 --> 1:06:14.210
- Wait here, I'm gonna
get you the medical kit.

1:06:14.221 --> 1:06:16.928
(dramatic music)

1:06:27.109 --> 1:06:27.939
- She's lying.

1:06:29.570 --> 1:06:30.855
What you don't believe me?

1:06:30.863 --> 1:06:33.149
- I have to check something.

1:06:36.410 --> 1:06:39.117
(dramatic music)

1:06:41.582 --> 1:06:42.697
It's the same.

1:06:44.168 --> 1:06:44.953
- What?

1:06:49.548 --> 1:06:53.336
It reminds me that the
world is full of sheep,

1:06:53.343 --> 1:06:54.173
keeps me centered.

1:06:54.178 --> 1:06:57.466
- [Jeff] Shut up! What babe?

1:06:59.516 --> 1:07:04.010
- Hannah's boyfriend, Richard
Smith it's the same guy!

1:07:04.021 --> 1:07:05.431
It's his money.

1:07:05.439 --> 1:07:06.224
- Him?

1:07:07.733 --> 1:07:11.567
- Bottom of the ninth Jeff, a
lot of pressure don't blow it.

1:07:11.570 --> 1:07:12.685
- [Jeff] You think that's funny?

1:07:12.696 --> 1:07:13.481
- Stop!

1:07:15.240 --> 1:07:16.025
- He'll break.

1:07:18.911 --> 1:07:22.620
- He will, not like that.

1:07:23.582 --> 1:07:26.244
(dramatic music)

1:07:28.128 --> 1:07:29.038
Tape his mouth.

1:07:30.005 --> 1:07:32.712
(dramatic music)

1:07:59.868 --> 1:08:00.653
Here.

1:08:01.745 --> 1:08:04.452
(dramatic music)

1:08:19.596 --> 1:08:21.177
You ever chip a nail detective?

1:08:23.141 --> 1:08:24.802
There's a lot of nerve
endings in the fingertip,

1:08:24.810 --> 1:08:27.222
women deal with it all the time.

1:08:27.229 --> 1:08:30.437
Although we have a higher
threshold for pain than men.

1:08:31.858 --> 1:08:36.352
Helps us with childbirth, it's genetic.

1:08:36.363 --> 1:08:39.070
(dramatic music)

1:08:41.743 --> 1:08:44.735
(groaning)

1:08:44.746 --> 1:08:45.531
Right here.

1:08:46.456 --> 1:08:48.663
(groaning)

1:08:51.795 --> 1:08:53.626
- [Jeff] Guess I'm the relief pitcher.

1:08:55.173 --> 1:08:57.380
(groaning)

1:09:03.932 --> 1:09:08.892
- Again.

1:09:16.737 --> 1:09:18.773
(crying)

1:09:20.490 --> 1:09:21.275
- Another.

1:09:25.704 --> 1:09:27.740
(crying)

1:09:34.796 --> 1:09:39.665
That's three, there's
seven more, 17 if you want

1:09:40.886 --> 1:09:42.376
to press your luck.

1:09:46.391 --> 1:09:47.722
When I take this tape
off I want you to start

1:09:47.726 --> 1:09:50.388
at the beginning, do you understand me?

1:09:50.395 --> 1:09:53.102
(dramatic music)

1:09:55.567 --> 1:09:57.853
(groans)

1:09:57.861 --> 1:10:00.568
(dramatic music)

1:10:20.842 --> 1:10:22.127
She hasn't changed at all.

1:10:32.604 --> 1:10:35.516
- You still got me,
that's worth something.

1:10:40.445 --> 1:10:42.151
It'll be dark in two hours.

1:10:43.323 --> 1:10:44.108
- I know.

1:10:49.371 --> 1:10:51.032
- Both bodies will fit in the car.

1:10:53.959 --> 1:10:55.290
- You can't murder him Jeff.

1:10:55.293 --> 1:11:00.253
- It's self defense, Smith,
Richard, whoever the fuck

1:11:01.258 --> 1:11:04.671
this guy is, he's gonna be
after us as long as he's alive.

1:11:05.887 --> 1:11:07.172
Know that.

1:11:08.140 --> 1:11:10.506
(soft music)

1:11:14.187 --> 1:11:16.143
- What will we do after?

1:11:17.357 --> 1:11:19.097
- There's a dumpster out on Route 4.

1:11:19.109 --> 1:11:20.645
- No Jeff, what would we do?

1:11:21.987 --> 1:11:24.603
I go back to the bank tomorrow
like nothing happened?

1:11:24.614 --> 1:11:27.981
You keep dry walling
and handing out resumes?

1:11:27.993 --> 1:11:30.700
(dramatic music)

1:11:33.039 --> 1:11:35.121
- We'll pick up the pieces and move on

1:11:35.125 --> 1:11:36.035
like we always have.

1:11:36.042 --> 1:11:37.452
- Where has that gotten us?

1:11:38.462 --> 1:11:39.998
I mean look around this
wasn't what we planned.

1:11:40.005 --> 1:11:41.461
- You don't think I know that?

1:11:45.010 --> 1:11:48.298
It's just a bump in the
road Lindsey, once we deal

1:11:48.305 --> 1:11:52.298
with this mess, once we
deal with your sister.

1:11:52.309 --> 1:11:54.220
- [Lindsey] Whoa, what do
you mean deal with my sister?

1:11:54.227 --> 1:11:55.433
- She lied to you.

1:11:55.437 --> 1:11:56.472
- He manipulated her.

1:11:57.647 --> 1:11:58.432
- Look,

1:11:59.483 --> 1:12:01.849
we just need her out of the
way for a couple of hours

1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:04.192
while we deal with this
little shit show first.

1:12:06.198 --> 1:12:10.066
When this is all settled
down we'll use the money,

1:12:10.076 --> 1:12:14.991
set her up someplace,
get her back on her feet.

1:12:17.375 --> 1:12:18.285
- Do you mean that?

1:12:19.878 --> 1:12:20.663
- Yeah.

1:12:24.341 --> 1:12:27.128
- Do I have your word she won't get hurt?

1:12:27.135 --> 1:12:28.045
- Scout's honor.

1:12:31.473 --> 1:12:33.429
She betrayed you, you know?

1:12:35.644 --> 1:12:36.633
- She's family.

1:12:40.899 --> 1:12:41.684
- So am I.

1:12:43.693 --> 1:12:46.400
(dramatic music)

1:13:13.306 --> 1:13:14.091
- It's time.

1:13:34.953 --> 1:13:36.238
I always hated finance.

1:13:37.163 --> 1:13:38.198
- But you work in a bank.

1:13:38.206 --> 1:13:39.707
- Funny how life turns out.

1:13:47.007 --> 1:13:47.837
You kept it?

1:13:47.841 --> 1:13:51.504
- Yeah, all this shit over
one little piece of paper

1:13:51.511 --> 1:13:53.843
it just didn't feel
right to throw it away.

1:13:55.265 --> 1:13:56.254
- [Lindsey] Let's go.

1:13:58.184 --> 1:14:00.891
(dramatic music)

1:14:36.348 --> 1:14:37.463
- I fucked up.

1:14:41.353 --> 1:14:43.765
I should tell you something,
it's about Richard,

1:14:43.772 --> 1:14:46.479
it's just he's the guy in the basement.

1:14:46.483 --> 1:14:47.268
- I know.

1:14:49.152 --> 1:14:49.982
- You're not mad?

1:14:51.738 --> 1:14:52.602
- Do you love him?

1:14:54.783 --> 1:14:56.489
- I don't know.

1:14:56.493 --> 1:14:59.781
(dramatic music)

1:14:59.788 --> 1:15:01.824
(crying)

1:15:09.798 --> 1:15:12.505
- It's gonna be alright, come on.

1:15:23.645 --> 1:15:24.851
(dramatic music)

1:15:24.854 --> 1:15:26.719
- Let me go, let me go!

1:15:37.492 --> 1:15:39.528
(crying)

1:15:44.082 --> 1:15:46.198
(yelling)

1:15:48.336 --> 1:15:51.043
- Hannah listen to me, shh.

1:15:51.047 --> 1:15:53.424
Whatever they have in mind
isn't good for either of us,

1:15:53.425 --> 1:15:55.416
so you got to do exactly
what I say and we'll get

1:15:55.427 --> 1:15:56.507
out of this okay?

1:15:56.511 --> 1:15:59.799
Now follow my voice and
get as close as possible.

1:15:59.806 --> 1:16:04.766
You got it, straight back, there you go.

1:16:08.481 --> 1:16:09.766
- What if she can't breath?

1:16:10.817 --> 1:16:12.353
- You ever get five
minutes of peace and quiet

1:16:12.360 --> 1:16:13.270
when she's around?

1:16:14.863 --> 1:16:16.319
She's got strong lungs.

1:16:17.490 --> 1:16:19.481
I'm gonna get the gun
and a couple of pillows.

1:16:19.492 --> 1:16:22.199
(dramatic music)

1:16:29.252 --> 1:16:33.165
- There you go, one
more, one more, now try

1:16:35.592 --> 1:16:36.707
to get onto your knees.

1:16:40.096 --> 1:16:41.336
There you go.

1:16:41.347 --> 1:16:44.054
(dramatic music)

1:16:54.819 --> 1:16:55.604
Little bit more,

1:16:57.697 --> 1:17:00.780
listen to me, we are gonna
get through this okay.

1:17:00.784 --> 1:17:02.445
I need you to get the
wolf's head charm from your

1:17:02.452 --> 1:17:05.865
bracelet, it's sharp,
you can cut with that.

1:17:05.872 --> 1:17:07.237
- [Hannah] Got it.

1:17:07.248 --> 1:17:10.490
- [Lindsey] Yeah that's
right, 227 Leader Drive.

1:17:13.171 --> 1:17:14.911
Please just come as soon as you can.

1:17:18.676 --> 1:17:19.540
- What are you doing?

1:17:20.512 --> 1:17:21.467
- Why two pillows?

1:17:22.972 --> 1:17:25.588
The money's gone and you
have two pillows why?

1:17:26.935 --> 1:17:29.642
(dramatic music)

1:17:36.027 --> 1:17:37.187
- Help me.

1:17:37.195 --> 1:17:41.939
- Shh, shh, they can hear us,
just give me a second, okay?

1:17:41.950 --> 1:17:44.657
(dramatic music)

1:17:56.172 --> 1:18:00.541
Just like a bandaid, just
like a big fucking bandaid.

1:18:05.431 --> 1:18:09.424
- If the money's gone your sister took it.

1:18:09.435 --> 1:18:10.891
- I asked you a question.

1:18:14.190 --> 1:18:16.101
- To muffle the shots,
now put the gun down.

1:18:16.109 --> 1:18:17.064
- Shots?

1:18:17.068 --> 1:18:19.525
Plural, one person, one shot, one pillow.

1:18:19.529 --> 1:18:21.645
- What do you think this is, huh?

1:18:23.825 --> 1:18:25.235
A goddamn fairy tail?

1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:30.032
Wake up, Hannah is not on our side.

1:18:30.039 --> 1:18:31.415
- This isn't about sides.

1:18:35.628 --> 1:18:39.496
- That's exactly what this is about.

1:18:39.507 --> 1:18:42.169
(dramatic music)

1:18:44.429 --> 1:18:45.544
- Please untie me,

1:18:45.555 --> 1:18:46.465
- Hold on.

1:18:46.472 --> 1:18:48.303
- it hurts, it really, really hurts.

1:18:48.308 --> 1:18:49.423
- [Smith] Shh.

1:18:54.564 --> 1:18:56.520
- Just let me go please.

1:19:07.619 --> 1:19:10.326
(dramatic music)

1:19:17.295 --> 1:19:19.331
- You know I got a lot
of ass over the years.

1:19:23.343 --> 1:19:25.334
But yours was definitely the sweetest.

1:19:25.345 --> 1:19:27.757
- [Jeff] Calm down, calm down!

1:19:30.099 --> 1:19:31.134
- She's my sister.

1:19:34.354 --> 1:19:35.264
- I don't care.

1:19:38.107 --> 1:19:38.892
-Ido.

1:19:47.242 --> 1:19:49.073
(dramatic music)

1:19:49.077 --> 1:19:50.283
- [Jeff] Honey.

1:19:51.537 --> 1:19:52.663
- Go to sleep.

1:20:04.467 --> 1:20:07.174
(dramatic music)

1:20:41.379 --> 1:20:42.619
- We made a vow.

1:20:45.800 --> 1:20:46.630
Remember?

1:20:52.640 --> 1:20:55.347
(dramatic music)

1:20:57.437 --> 1:20:58.973
We can tell each other anything.

1:21:04.027 --> 1:21:08.066
You want her out of your life, so do I.

1:21:19.459 --> 1:21:22.747
Brutal honesty Linds,
that's what marriage is.

1:21:26.174 --> 1:21:28.881
(dramatic music)

1:21:48.529 --> 1:21:52.272
Please Lindsey, don't make me hurt you.

1:21:52.283 --> 1:21:54.569
I love you too much.

1:21:54.577 --> 1:21:55.737
- You don't even know what that means.

1:21:55.745 --> 1:22:00.705
- Yes I do, everything
I did, I did for us,

1:22:00.708 --> 1:22:02.494
don't you understand that?

1:22:02.502 --> 1:22:03.992
- You're out of your mind.

1:22:07.757 --> 1:22:11.249

out, or die trying.

1:22:13.388 --> 1:22:15.595

Got a lot more fight than your sister did,

Lindsey, can you imagine

1:24:36.364 --> 1:24:39.197
if we met when we were single?

1:24:40.201 --> 1:24:41.361
Well technically,

1:24:42.703 --> 1:24:47.663
I guess we are, what do you say?

1:24:48.918 --> 1:24:51.625
(dramatic music)

1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:16.066

1:26:22.470 --> 1:26:24.756
Ma'am, I really think it'd be best for you

1:26:24.764 --> 1:26:26.379
to stay with someone tonight.

1:26:27.933 --> 1:26:29.139
- I think right now I just need

1:26:29.143 --> 1:26:30.758
to sleep for a very long time.

1:26:32.855 --> 1:26:34.971
- Well don't go too far,
we'll have more questions

1:26:34.982 --> 1:26:36.188
for you when you're ready.

1:26:36.192 --> 1:26:36.977
- Of course.

1:26:43.491 --> 1:26:46.858
- Ma'am, this place is
miles away from anything,

1:26:46.869 --> 1:26:47.654
why here?

1:26:50.748 --> 1:26:52.704
- Because it's miles away from anything.

1:26:57.963 --> 1:26:59.954
- You take care Mrs. Pittman.

1:26:59.965 --> 1:27:00.750
- I will.

1:27:11.102 --> 1:27:14.515
- That was a bad scene
man, and all over 50 grand.

1:27:18.150 --> 1:27:19.356
You think she'll be okay?

1:27:20.820 --> 1:27:24.938
- Yeah I do, she's a survivor,

1:27:27.284 --> 1:27:30.026
hey let's hit that diner over on 87th

1:27:30.037 --> 1:27:32.119
for some corned beef and cabbage.

1:27:32.123 --> 1:27:32.953
- [Driver] Oh no.

1:27:32.957 --> 1:27:34.447
- It's a tradition.

1:27:34.458 --> 1:27:36.744
- Have at it, I'll stick with a burger.

Now weren't you hear earlier?

1:28:43.277 --> 1:28:45.313
- That was my sister.

1:28:45.321 --> 1:28:47.858
- Oh yeah,

1:28:48.783 --> 1:28:53.743
the one who got the bag and put it back.

1:28:56.290 --> 1:28:59.282
She said she'll get it tomorrow, oh well,

1:29:01.629 --> 1:29:03.335
I guess that's today.

1:29:04.340 --> 1:29:05.830
