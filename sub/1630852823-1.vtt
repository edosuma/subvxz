[TV chattering continues]

02:01.730 --> 02:04.385
[indistinct PA announcement]
So?

02:06.300 --> 02:10.521
[echoing]
Good morning, Tessa.
I'm Dr. Sarkisian.

02:10.565 --> 02:13.002
You've been in
a very bad car accident.

02:13.045 --> 02:15.613
You ruptured your heart
due to trauma,

02:15.657 --> 02:18.703
which we were forced
to repair surgically.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.402
Tessa?

02:21.445 --> 02:24.796
[laughter, chattering on TV]

[dishes clattering]

03:12.017 --> 03:13.541
Morning.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.848
Morning.
I made pancakes.

03:16.892 --> 03:19.938
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go shoot photos.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.592
Oh, it's so cold outside.

03:21.636 --> 03:24.116
Yeah, I just don't want
to miss the morning light.

03:24.160 --> 03:28.295
Well, maybe when you're
back, we could do a little
research for colleges.

03:28.338 --> 03:29.905
All right. Bye.

03:31.036 --> 03:33.387
["Teenage Headache Dreams"
playing]

03:35.693 --> 03:37.521
She hides behind
that camera.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.872
She's not taken
a single picture of us.

03:40.916 --> 03:43.179
You're too pretty.
You'd break her lens.

03:43.788 --> 03:46.313
Hey, I told you.
You've gotta let her
come to you.

03:46.356 --> 03:50.012
It's been a year.
Signing a piece of paper
doesn't make us her parents.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.274
Actually it does.

04:10.511 --> 04:11.773
[shutter clicks]

05:51.525 --> 05:53.004
You open, Sherman?

05:53.048 --> 05:54.919
I am for you, Tessa.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.618
Um, I think I'm
a little short.

05:57.661 --> 06:01.361
That's no crime.
I'm only 5'6".

06:02.623 --> 06:04.364
Enjoy the show.

Sherman, where are
the subtitles?

07:09.472 --> 07:11.431
You watch. I'll translate.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.398
[speaking French]

07:22.442 --> 07:24.922
"It's the first time
we've met in daylight."

07:25.706 --> 07:26.707
[speaking French]

07:26.750 --> 07:28.360
"But you're very early."

07:28.404 --> 07:30.928
I think I'm just gonna go
tell the theater owner.

07:31.712 --> 07:35.367
I mean, there's nothing he
can do about it. They
obviously sent him the wrong
print.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.326
I can get my money back.

07:38.545 --> 07:41.896
I've seen this film before.
I don't think you want
to miss it.

07:42.549 --> 07:43.680
Does it have a happy ending?

07:43.724 --> 07:47.075
No. Definitely not.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.035
Okay. Then I'll say.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.257
[speaking French]

07:55.300 --> 07:57.128
"You gonna eat
all that chili by yourself?

07:58.303 --> 08:00.610
In this heat, you're mad."

08:00.654 --> 08:02.220
[Zorg speaking French]

08:02.264 --> 08:05.310
"I eat chili no matter
how hot it is, Betty."

08:05.354 --> 08:09.401
[both speaking French]
"Those bastards." "What?"

08:12.579 --> 08:14.102
"Never mind. Kiss me."

08:16.844 --> 08:18.410
[Betty speaking French]

08:18.454 --> 08:21.196
"Those bastards.
How could they do this to
you?"

08:36.211 --> 08:39.519
[continues translating,
indistinct]

09:40.884 --> 09:44.671
I'm sorry.
How long was I doing that?

09:44.714 --> 09:47.108
I lost feeling
about an hour ago,

09:47.151 --> 09:49.066
so I'm not sure.
Why didn't you
say something?

09:49.110 --> 09:52.809
Um, the movie is
a bit of a downer, so...

09:53.549 --> 09:56.117
It's a love story.
[sniffles]

09:56.160 --> 09:59.773
I mean,
not all love stories
are downers.

10:00.382 --> 10:01.862
All the good ones are.

10:02.732 --> 10:05.648
Romeo and Juliet,
Anna Karenina,

10:05.692 --> 10:07.868
The English Patient.
Mm-hmm.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.827
I think it's the ending
of a relationship,

10:10.871 --> 10:13.700
that's what makes
a love story so memorable.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.398
What about
Pride and Prejudice?

10:16.441 --> 10:19.575
Jane Eyre?
Those both have
happy endings.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.535
That's only because
the writer chose to end
their love stories
prematurely.

10:24.232 --> 10:28.062
Wow. That is
a really interesting way

10:28.105 --> 10:30.717
of not admitting
you're wrong.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.502
[laughing]

10:33.545 --> 10:36.200
Come on! Okay. Picture this.

10:36.244 --> 10:40.727
Picture that Leonardo
DiCaprio didn't die at the
end of Titanic.

10:40.770 --> 10:43.251
Do I have to? Oof.
You have to.

10:43.294 --> 10:47.385
Jack Dawson is a jobless,
penniless gambler,

10:47.429 --> 10:51.215
who possessed, at best,
marginal artistic talent.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.653
He saved Rose's life.
Right, of course.

10:53.696 --> 10:58.701
But he also love-bombed her
and stole her away
from her fiancé.

10:58.745 --> 11:03.010
And poor Rose was
just so hypnotized
by that steamy car sex,

11:03.053 --> 11:09.103
that she really thought
that he'd give her a life
of passionate adventure?

11:10.452 --> 11:17.502
Please, come on.
That's a life of abject
poverty and dehumanizing
infidelity.

11:19.766 --> 11:23.944
Titanic 2.
If you thought part one
was a disaster...

11:29.732 --> 11:31.821
Oh, my gosh.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.260
[clears throat]

11:37.348 --> 11:38.698
I--
[Sherman] Time to go!

11:39.786 --> 11:43.615
Jesus, this guy is getting
a one-star review, for sure.

11:44.660 --> 11:48.795
So, um, how did you get
so good at speaking French?

11:48.838 --> 11:51.841
My dad is
a foreign languages
professor.

11:51.885 --> 11:56.628
So by the time I was 12,
he had me fluent in French,
Spanish, and Italian.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.587
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

11:58.630 --> 12:02.852
If I could just read
Dante's Inferno
in the original Italian,

12:02.896 --> 12:06.203
my life would be
complete, I think.
I get that a lot.

12:06.247 --> 12:09.729
Really?
No. No, I've never
gotten that before.

12:14.821 --> 12:18.041
That's some pretty old gear
you got there.
You don't shoot digital?

12:18.085 --> 12:21.566
No, I don't.
I get a much higher
dynamic range on film.

12:22.480 --> 12:26.920
Plus, I'm also
kind of addicted to the
smell of the developing
chemicals.

12:26.963 --> 12:29.400
The fumes make me
a little delirious.
[laughs]

12:29.444 --> 12:31.925
Kind of like what your eyes
are doing to me right now.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.405
Ooh.

12:34.449 --> 12:35.798
That...

12:35.842 --> 12:37.452
[both chuckle]

12:37.495 --> 12:39.933
That was really cheesy.
No, no.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.500
It was... It was...

12:42.544 --> 12:44.328
a little cheesy, yeah.

12:45.199 --> 12:48.289
It sounded perfect
in my head.

12:48.332 --> 12:51.858
Oh, okay. Then let me
imagine that for a sec,
okay.
Okay.

12:52.946 --> 12:55.644
Still bad?
It's worse, actually.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.472
Somehow, I don't know.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.431
[door opens]
[exhales]

13:03.130 --> 13:05.741
Um, I should probably...

13:05.785 --> 13:07.308
Yeah, me too.

13:10.050 --> 13:13.314
Um, thank you for letting me

13:13.357 --> 13:17.579
whisper in your ear
for three hours.

13:17.622 --> 13:18.972
You are welcome.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.728
Skylar.
What?

13:36.772 --> 13:39.079
My name is...
It's Skylar.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.689
I'm Tessa.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.866
Maybe I'll see you here
again sometime.

13:44.562 --> 13:45.607
Yeah, I'd like that.

13:50.917 --> 13:51.918
[sighs]

13:51.961 --> 13:53.528
Oh! My jacket.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.650
[seagulls squawking]

14:28.693 --> 14:31.087
[shutter clicking]

14:32.132 --> 14:34.874
[clock ticking]

14:38.660 --> 14:40.705
[ticking slows, distorts]

14:52.935 --> 14:56.286
Sky. You're alive!

15:02.727 --> 15:05.469
[heartbeat thumping]

15:11.649 --> 15:13.564
Come on. I want
to show you something.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.481
[lights humming]

15:32.496 --> 15:33.933
Sky!

15:34.629 --> 15:36.544
Bad dream.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.157
You called out his name.

15:42.115 --> 15:45.248
It's called a visitation
dream. We see lots of 'em
around here.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.598
It's all part
of the grieving process.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.558
I know. It just felt
like Skylar was really here.

15:50.601 --> 15:54.170
Doris would love
to hear about that.
Who's Doris?

15:54.214 --> 15:57.913
A patient writing a book
on the afterlife.
Okay.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.872
The other day,
she offered to read my aura.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.483
I politely declined.

16:05.051 --> 16:08.315
What is that?
Your belongings
from the crash.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.534
They closed
the accident report already?

16:10.578 --> 16:13.233
Well, neither driver
had drugs or alcohol
in their system.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.278
That's usually
the end of it.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.889
They never even
interviewed me.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.285
You said you didn't remember
anything about the accident?

16:24.679 --> 16:28.030
I don't.
Maybe that's for the best.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.443
[Dr. Sarkisian]
I'm very encouraged, Tessa.

16:49.486 --> 16:50.966
The scan shows
your right ventricle

16:51.010 --> 16:52.968
is functioning quite well,
despite the tear.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.970
Finally, some good news.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.928
It is more than good.

16:56.972 --> 17:00.019
Ninety-nine out of 100
with this same injury
die on my table.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.411
I did die.

17:01.455 --> 17:03.413
Only for a short time.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.416
I could see Skylar.

17:07.330 --> 17:10.551
Like, he was in this...
this crazy white light.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.901
What is that?
Was she, you know,
hallucinating?

17:12.944 --> 17:15.034
When the body undergoes
severe trauma...

17:15.077 --> 17:17.427
[heartbeat thumping]
...the hypothalamus
can flood the brain

17:17.471 --> 17:20.387
with pain relieving endorphins.
[Vickie]
So when can we take her
home?

17:20.430 --> 17:24.521
[Dr. Sarkisian] End of the
week. Tessa needs to be
extremely careful these next
few months.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.480
Any chest pains
or shortness of breath,

17:26.523 --> 17:29.961
you call 911 immediately.
Understand?

17:30.005 --> 17:32.225
[shower running]

17:33.008 --> 17:35.228
[heartbeat thumping]

18:01.689 --> 18:03.734
[crying]

18:13.353 --> 18:15.616
[crying continues]

18:16.356 --> 18:18.314
[knocking on door]

18:23.145 --> 18:26.366
Jazz? Just give me a second.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.370
Jazz?

18:38.987 --> 18:41.207
[electrical crackling]

18:44.035 --> 18:46.168
[phone chimes, buzzes]

19:11.889 --> 19:14.501
[Skylar]
You watch, I'll translate.

19:23.727 --> 19:26.165
[indistinct PA announcement]

19:38.220 --> 19:41.267
Hi, excuse me.
Are you Doris?

19:41.310 --> 19:45.706
[exhales] I am going to take
a wild guess here.

19:46.924 --> 19:53.061
Room B424,
girl with the broken heart?

19:53.104 --> 19:56.717
[laughing] Relax.

19:56.760 --> 19:57.718
I'm not psychic.

19:58.371 --> 20:01.200
Jasmine told me you might
come looking for me.
Oh.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.638
My condolences.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.335
Thank you.

20:06.379 --> 20:07.989
Are your hands injured?

20:08.032 --> 20:09.077
Excuse me?

20:09.817 --> 20:12.646
From the accident.
Did you hurt
your hands at all?

20:12.689 --> 20:15.779
No, why?
Ta-da! Huh?

20:15.823 --> 20:18.913
Oh, come on. Come on.
[chuckles]

20:20.610 --> 20:23.004
So, what is your book about?

20:23.047 --> 20:25.528
It's about ADC's.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.574
After Death Communication.

20:28.531 --> 20:32.318
Okay, so you believe that
dead people can contact us?

20:32.361 --> 20:35.146
Along with billions
of other people

20:35.190 --> 20:38.846
from faiths
that span the globe.

20:40.282 --> 20:43.633
Sometimes, the departed,

20:43.677 --> 20:47.811
they call out
to us in voice.

20:48.290 --> 20:54.949
And other times, we can
smell their cologne or
perfume in the air.

20:56.342 --> 21:00.650
No matter how they
communicate, the message is
the same.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.479
"I'm still here.

21:03.523 --> 21:06.134
And your grief,
like a beacon,

21:06.177 --> 21:07.918
calls me to your side."

21:09.529 --> 21:12.662
And when the separation
has been traumatic,

21:12.706 --> 21:14.882
like with you
and your boyfriend,

21:14.925 --> 21:17.928
there's often
unfinished business.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.714
Like regrets or something?

21:20.757 --> 21:25.109
Like things left undone
or unsaid.

21:25.153 --> 21:26.807
[door opens]
[Vickie] Tessa.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.983
We signed you out.
It's time to go.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.029
He's in the in-between.

21:32.073 --> 21:35.250
But he won't be there for
long, a few weeks at most.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.991
And when he moves on...

21:38.427 --> 21:40.342
he's gone for good.

21:40.386 --> 21:43.040
I gotta go.
Oh, wait, wait.

21:43.084 --> 21:45.652
Here, take this.
It's my first book.

21:45.695 --> 21:47.915
It's a good place
to start.
That's okay.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.657
He's reaching out to you.

21:52.441 --> 21:53.660
Reach back.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.054
It's too late for that.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.895
[teacher]
Tessa, you're up.

[clears throat]

22:26.780 --> 22:30.392
Um, this is a photo that
I took back in February.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.874
Is that how you spend
your free time,
taking pictures of trees?

22:35.092 --> 22:37.399
Well, it's actually
not a tree, asshole.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.096
[class laughs]
It's a cell phone tower,

22:39.140 --> 22:40.576
disguised as a tree.

22:42.230 --> 22:46.408
It is an allegory
for the artificiality
of modern life.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.802
[school bell rings]

22:51.544 --> 22:53.241
It's a lovely photo, Tessa.

22:53.284 --> 22:55.635
Your technical skills have
taken huge leaps this year.

22:55.678 --> 22:57.767
Oh, thank you.
I know you're
still a junior,

22:57.811 --> 23:01.162
but I think you have a good
shot of getting into the
Rhode Island School of
Design.

23:01.205 --> 23:03.251
I'd be happy to write you
a letter of recommendation.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.862
Thank you. I just--
My work's not ready
for that yet.

23:05.906 --> 23:08.735
Oh? What do you feel
is missing?

23:09.475 --> 23:10.824
Just like a point of view.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.913
You know, something to say
that's my own.

23:12.956 --> 23:16.612
Well, maybe it's time
for your subject matter
to evolve.

23:16.656 --> 23:19.963
After all,
there is something notably
missing from all your
photos.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.574
Yeah, I know. Color.

23:21.617 --> 23:24.228
No. People.

23:25.099 --> 23:27.449
You know, Tessa, before
an artist can find her
voice,

23:27.493 --> 23:29.712
she has to find
a subject she loves.

23:30.757 --> 23:32.759
Who or what
do you love, Tessa?

23:33.760 --> 23:36.023
["Closer" playing]

23:45.249 --> 23:46.599
[Skylar]
I should probably...

23:46.642 --> 23:48.252
Yeah, me too.

24:52.665 --> 24:55.102
Hey, okay.
What do you think?

24:56.016 --> 24:58.888
Red?
Noisy colors
are trendy.

24:59.585 --> 25:03.763
I don't know. I feel like
you're kind of taking
advantage of your dad's
niceness.

25:03.806 --> 25:06.548
Of course, I am.
My dad is putty when
I get straight A's.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.158
Hey, yo, Tess!

25:09.116 --> 25:11.988
Hi, Cortez.
Hey, uh, do you have
plans this weekend?

25:12.032 --> 25:16.515
As it happens, I actually
work as Tessa's full-time
scheduler,

25:16.558 --> 25:20.344
so I can say, with
absolute authority, that
she does not have any plans

25:20.388 --> 25:22.477
this weekend.
What are you saying?
What are you doing?

25:22.521 --> 25:24.740
Well, the final crew meet
of the season is this
Saturday.

25:24.784 --> 25:27.700
I was kind of wondering
if you 'd come out
and take some photos.

25:27.743 --> 25:31.225
Uh, sorry. I don't really do
sports photography.

25:31.268 --> 25:34.576
But if you glue
a selfie stick to your
forehead, it might be the
same thing.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.317
Will Judd be there?

25:37.448 --> 25:41.452
Well, wherever I go,
my rowing partner goes,
so...

25:41.496 --> 25:42.932
Then we'll be there.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.108
"We" will be there?

25:45.152 --> 25:47.197
I'll be there as your photo
assistant, remember?

25:47.241 --> 25:48.503
I'm her photo assistant.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.679
Well, the first race
starts at30.

25:50.723 --> 25:53.813

He didn't mean morning,
did he?

[Tessa]
Yup, he did.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.308
Do you think Judd
can see me from here?

26:12.048 --> 26:14.834
Hey!
You are fired.
Give me this.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.576
Assistanting is
not my thing. My bad.

26:17.619 --> 26:20.187
You were the one
who dragged me out here.
So behave, please.

You never said he was hot.

28:24.180 --> 28:27.488
Yes, I did.
No, you said he was cute.

28:27.531 --> 28:32.754
Emojis are cute.
That guy is like melting
my sunglasses, Tess.

28:34.277 --> 28:36.366
I think I'm gonna go.
Are you crazy?

28:37.019 --> 28:40.544
You've been obsessed
about this guy for like
months, and you're just
gonna ditch?

28:40.588 --> 28:44.244
I don't know what
to say to him.
"Hold me."

28:44.287 --> 28:46.420
He just won the race.
Congratulate him.

28:47.334 --> 28:48.378
Okay.

28:50.598 --> 28:52.078
Can I put this on my Story?

Spanish, French and Italian.

don't read

call a finish.

Her name is Tessa.
How did you...

29:49.918 --> 29:53.530
The blue eyes.
Skylar went on and on
about them.

29:53.574 --> 29:57.404
Wow, Mom! Does anyone see
a deep, dark hole
I can crawl into?

29:57.447 --> 29:59.710
[Leigh] You know,
he spent weeks searching
for you on the Internet.

29:59.754 --> 30:02.409
Mom...
[Leigh] And he couldn't find
a thing about you.

30:02.452 --> 30:04.541
Well, that is by design.

30:04.585 --> 30:06.500

is driving me crazy.

30:09.546 --> 30:12.071

Tell him-- Tell him I won.

30:12.114 --> 30:16.249
No. You can talk to him
yourself later. Are you
going to be heading back to
Edison tonight?

30:16.292 --> 30:20.296
No, I'm gonna be staying
at Grandpa Mike's. Um...

But first, I was gonna see
if Tessa maybe wanted to
go...

a girlfriend, do you?

No. Not since
the eighth grade. Why?

31:28.756 --> 31:30.889
This kinda looks like you.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.716
[laughs] No. That is, uh...

31:32.760 --> 31:36.503
That's my mom and dad
when they were teenagers.
Oh!

31:36.546 --> 31:39.375
Yeah, this is actually
the same Jeep that my
grandpa

31:39.419 --> 31:41.769
bought my mom
for her 18th birthday.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.511
You can actually see it
behind them in the photo.

31:44.554 --> 31:47.949
Oh, yeah! They're so cute.
They look so in love.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.212
Yeah, they were.
"They were"?

31:50.256 --> 31:52.084
Are. They are.

My dad's just
living and teaching in
Oregon right now.

31:56.044 --> 31:59.961
That's pretty far.
Are they, like, taking
a break or something?

32:00.005 --> 32:01.397
No.

32:03.051 --> 32:07.316
They're gonna be fine.
They talk almost
every day, so...

32:11.842 --> 32:13.148
Some music.

32:13.192 --> 32:15.150
Whoa!

take a look.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.371

32:19.241 --> 32:22.723

her a mix tape?

32:37.303 --> 32:39.087
Yes, he did.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.621
It's the other way.

It's okay. I won't tell
the '80s police.
Shut up.

I have spent every summer
of my life down here
with my grandfather.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.535
How have I never
heard of this place?

33:35.578 --> 33:37.754
Well, that's my favorite
part about taking photos.

33:37.798 --> 33:41.889
It's like you just
stumble and wander
and find places like this.

33:41.932 --> 33:46.459
Right. But what...
what drew you
to this spot specifically?

33:47.155 --> 33:48.417
The view.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.377
That view.

33:51.420 --> 33:52.900
[seagulls squawking]

33:52.943 --> 33:54.771
It was called
The Empyrean.

33:54.815 --> 33:58.340
It was a honeymooners'
resort back in the '60s.

33:58.384 --> 34:01.474
It's so surreal.
It's unbelievable.

34:03.345 --> 34:04.651
You've gone in there?

34:05.695 --> 34:06.740
Unarmed?

34:07.697 --> 34:09.525
I'll do anything
for a great photo.

34:11.832 --> 34:13.486
"Empyrean"?

34:14.356 --> 34:16.184
That's where Dante
meets God, right?

34:16.228 --> 34:19.274
Highest of all heavens.
A place of pure love.

34:19.318 --> 34:24.105
Look at it. If that's
not a metaphor for love,
then I don't know what is.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.500
Can I see your photos?

34:28.892 --> 34:31.678
They're not on my phone.
I don't shoot digital,
remember?

34:32.418 --> 34:33.897
Well, how do people
see your work?

34:34.376 --> 34:37.945
I don't show it,
unless I have to for class.

34:37.988 --> 34:39.468
How come?

34:39.512 --> 34:41.427
'Cause I'm not
good enough yet.

34:41.470 --> 34:43.559

seriously difficult
to believe.

Okay, so if you won't
show me your photos,

34:50.175 --> 34:52.264
maybe you can
give me a tour.
Of The Empyrean?

34:52.307 --> 34:54.353
Yeah, show it to me.

one, two, three.

put your chin up

No. What are they saying?

Well, the groom,
he's saying...

Come on, honey.

You've been in the bathroom

You're my wife.

kissed me yet.

Um, they're not
my parents, actually.

40:14.020 --> 40:15.978
And how long are you
gonna be here for?

40:17.415 --> 40:19.068
The whole summer.

40:20.026 --> 40:22.420
I'm staying with my grandpa
until I leave for Brown.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.900
You're going to Brown? What?

40:25.640 --> 40:27.990
I just kissed
an Ivy League bro?

40:28.034 --> 40:30.993
[gasps]
[laughs]
Your street cred ruined?

40:31.037 --> 40:33.474
Only if you tell me
that you're also a
lifeguard.

40:33.996 --> 40:35.041
Yeah.

40:36.346 --> 40:37.957
Are you serious?
Mm-hmm.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.961
About three summers now
at Washington Avenue Beach.

40:42.004 --> 40:44.920
No! Why?

40:52.537 --> 40:54.147
Good night.
Good night.

41:11.730 --> 41:15.516
[heartbeat thumping]

41:29.530 --> 41:31.097
[sniffles]

41:33.403 --> 41:35.623
[continues crying softly]

41:40.846 --> 41:43.413
Do I need to kick
this guy's ass?

41:43.457 --> 41:44.893
No, she's just scared.

41:44.937 --> 41:45.938
Why?

41:46.547 --> 41:47.940
Because she likes him.

41:56.775 --> 41:58.603
[shutter clicks]

42:05.392 --> 42:07.176
[Vickie] Tessa?

42:08.830 --> 42:11.572
[footsteps approaching]

42:12.573 --> 42:14.096
Shannon's waiting.

42:16.490 --> 42:17.752
Okay, I'm coming.

42:25.630 --> 42:27.066
Hey, what's that?

42:27.936 --> 42:30.939
That is four
A's, one A-minus.

42:30.983 --> 42:32.593
Don't want to talk about it.

42:32.637 --> 42:35.901
I'm gonna tint the windows,
so no one knows it's me
inside.

42:35.944 --> 42:39.034
Geez, stop whining.
It's a car.

42:39.078 --> 42:40.906
So did you call
the phone company?

42:41.559 --> 42:43.648
Yeah.
And?

42:44.257 --> 42:48.566
You were right. They just
said that Skylar probably
sent the photo before the
accident

42:48.609 --> 42:52.308
and then it got stuck
in the server or something.

42:53.571 --> 42:59.402
But that doesn't explain
why my phone just turned on
after it was completely
trashed.

42:59.446 --> 43:00.795
Can you explain that?

43:02.536 --> 43:03.711
I can't. No.

43:05.408 --> 43:06.801
[sighs]

43:07.933 --> 43:08.934
Hey.

43:09.935 --> 43:11.893
It's totally normal
to read into things.

43:11.937 --> 43:14.722
My mom did the same thing
after her sister died.

43:14.766 --> 43:17.986
Every rainbow was a sign.

43:18.030 --> 43:20.641
Every butterfly
was a message from heaven.

43:21.555 --> 43:23.688
[door opens]

43:28.606 --> 43:31.783
Meet my computer on wheels.

43:36.918 --> 43:38.137
[Shannon] Shit.

43:39.007 --> 43:41.793
Sorry. You put it
on my Spotify.

43:42.489 --> 43:43.577
It's okay.

43:44.883 --> 43:46.319
[music stops]

43:48.538 --> 43:49.757
Hey.

43:51.019 --> 43:52.934
Talk to me, Tess.

43:54.849 --> 43:57.330
I can't believe he's gone.

43:58.070 --> 44:00.202
It's like I close my eyes

44:01.029 --> 44:03.466
and I see us meeting
for the first time.

44:04.337 --> 44:06.774
And I remember every word
that he said to me.

44:08.167 --> 44:11.431
I remember every expression
on his face.

44:12.040 --> 44:14.434
And then I open my eyes
and it's like...

44:15.217 --> 44:18.786
Did I, like, just dream
our entire relationship up?

44:18.830 --> 44:21.223
Did I dream him up?
Hey. I was there.

44:21.789 --> 44:23.661
He wasn't a dream, okay?

44:23.704 --> 44:26.838
Your head's just
a little scrambled.

44:26.881 --> 44:31.059
That happens when
two tons of metal comes
crashing into you.

44:31.103 --> 44:33.714
I don't even remember
the last thing I said to
him.

44:33.758 --> 44:35.194
Come on.
I'm serious.

44:36.804 --> 44:39.328
We were fighting
that last week, remember?

44:40.678 --> 44:41.896
Hey.

44:42.592 --> 44:45.770
You guys had an epic summer.

44:45.813 --> 44:49.817
One that you will
never forget.
Yeah.

44:49.861 --> 44:52.864
Damn, I won't forget it,
and I was just
a jealous bystander.

44:52.907 --> 44:54.517
[laughing]

44:56.432 --> 44:57.999
Oh, my God.

44:59.348 --> 45:03.613
It's my first day back,
and I look like a total
mess.

45:03.657 --> 45:05.006
Yeah. You do.

45:05.050 --> 45:08.053
[laughing]
You do, yeah.

45:08.096 --> 45:10.708
[school bell ringing]

45:28.421 --> 45:29.465
[phone chimes]

45:44.132 --> 45:45.917
I heard about
what happened, Tessa.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.570
I'm terribly sorry.

45:49.572 --> 45:52.271
If you were my daughter,
I'd tell you to use it.

45:53.359 --> 45:54.708
Use it?

45:54.752 --> 45:56.362
The pain, the emptiness.

45:56.405 --> 45:58.581
Channel it,
through your camera.

45:58.625 --> 46:02.672
Some of the greatest works
of art were produced
by intense grief.

46:02.716 --> 46:05.023
Okay.
Tessa.

46:05.066 --> 46:07.590
RISD portfolio day
is right around the corner.

46:07.634 --> 46:08.853
Thank you.

46:10.811 --> 46:13.640
[seagulls squawking]

46:13.683 --> 46:15.860
["Perfect Day" playing]

47:31.152 --> 47:32.501
[Mel] So that's it?

47:33.285 --> 47:35.809
You're just giving up
your photography?

47:35.853 --> 47:37.158
It sure looks like it.

47:37.202 --> 47:39.987
This is the same crap
your mom used to pull.

47:40.031 --> 47:41.641
She'd become obsessed
with things.

47:41.684 --> 47:43.861
Baking, yoga, pottery.

47:44.426 --> 47:47.429
One day, lose interest,
move on to the next.

47:48.256 --> 47:51.477
That's why she could never
get any traction in life.

47:52.478 --> 47:54.001
Are you done?

47:56.134 --> 47:58.266
You think Skylar
would have wanted this?

47:59.006 --> 48:00.355
I don't know.

48:01.704 --> 48:04.055
Why don't you go ask him?

48:12.759 --> 48:14.543
[sighs]

48:38.916 --> 48:42.223
[Skylar] It's okay.
I won't tell the '80s
police.
[Tessa] Shut up. [laughs]

48:42.267 --> 48:45.357
[heartbeat thumping]

49:20.827 --> 49:22.568
I'm still here, Tess.

49:31.794 --> 49:33.057
Sky?

49:34.884 --> 49:37.583
[seagulls squawking]

49:40.368 --> 49:43.110
[footsteps approaching]

49:44.329 --> 49:46.679
[Vickie] Tess?
I'm sleeping.

49:48.942 --> 49:52.206
I just did a double shift.
You were asleep when I left.

49:53.686 --> 49:55.470
Did you even eat anything?

49:56.123 --> 49:57.559
I'm not hungry.

49:59.083 --> 50:01.041
Can you please
just let me sleep?

50:01.085 --> 50:02.651
[sighs]

50:13.401 --> 50:16.317
[harmonica music
playing, faint]

51:54.459 --> 51:58.463
No. No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no...

52:17.177 --> 52:18.396
[gasps]

52:53.431 --> 52:56.085
No, no, no. No, no...

52:56.129 --> 52:57.652
No.

53:10.056 --> 53:12.319
[heartbeat thumping]

53:12.363 --> 53:15.583
[electrical crackling]

53:16.932 --> 53:19.500
[heartbeat continues]

53:21.285 --> 53:22.460
Hi.

53:51.184 --> 53:54.274
[indistinct PA announcement]

53:54.318 --> 53:56.929
Tessa?
Uh, I gotta talk to Doris.

53:56.972 --> 53:59.975
Hang on a second.
Let me-- Wait, Tessa.

54:00.802 --> 54:03.501
What--
Her family took her home
this morning.

54:04.371 --> 54:07.156
There was nothing
more we could do.
Are you okay, honey?

54:07.200 --> 54:09.681
Um, I just haven't--
I haven't eaten today.

54:09.724 --> 54:12.379
Um--
You know what,
let me check you out.

54:13.032 --> 54:15.382
Why do you need to talk
to Doris so bad?
It's just--

54:15.426 --> 54:18.646
It's about what
she was telling me before.
It's about the afterlife.

54:20.518 --> 54:23.825
Maybe that old coot
isn't so crazy after all.

54:23.869 --> 54:26.828
What do you mean?
Your heartbeat is fast,
but it sounds healthy.

54:26.872 --> 54:29.962
Wait, what do you--
What were you saying?
What do you mean?

54:30.571 --> 54:32.660
Doris told me you'd
come looking for her.

54:33.574 --> 54:35.446
She even left you something.

54:36.142 --> 54:37.622
Her book.

54:41.278 --> 54:45.630
Tessa, I have seen a lot
of dying and grieving
in my time here.

54:45.673 --> 54:47.806
Looking back
never helped anyone.

54:47.849 --> 54:50.069
There's either life
or there's death.

54:51.375 --> 54:52.898
There's no place in-between.

54:53.638 --> 54:55.335
I'm gonna find him.

54:56.467 --> 55:01.210
[Doris on video]
What does the in-between
look like?

55:01.907 --> 55:08.087
Well, we as living beings
can never imagine it.
We have no reference.

55:08.653 --> 55:14.615
It would be like trying
to describe a sunset
to a blind man.

55:16.225 --> 55:21.492
Technological advances
have made ghost-hunting
a legitimate field.

55:21.535 --> 55:27.280
My friend Darlene,
she let me borrow her
full-spectrum digital
camera.

55:27.324 --> 55:32.720
This baby can pick up light
well beyond the human eye,

55:32.764 --> 55:34.896
with infrared night vision--

55:37.159 --> 55:40.598
[Shannon and Tessa laughing]
[thunder rumbling]

55:42.339 --> 55:44.732
Well, happy Fourth of July.

55:45.342 --> 55:48.301
I don't know. I actually
kind of like this weather.
Don't call me.

55:48.345 --> 55:50.912
So, you think this means
the fireworks are canceled?

55:50.956 --> 55:53.393
I think so, yeah.
Yeah.

55:54.568 --> 55:56.004
Hey.
Hey.

55:57.223 --> 55:58.833
You okay?
Yeah.

55:58.877 --> 56:01.575
Skylar, Tess says
you're going to Brown.

56:01.619 --> 56:03.664
Congrats!
Thank you.

56:03.708 --> 56:05.013
What are you gonna study?

56:05.057 --> 56:07.886
Probably Latin.
That'll come in handy.

56:08.539 --> 56:11.280
You never know
when you're gonna meet
the Pope or something.

56:11.324 --> 56:13.065
Or need to conduct
an exorcism.

56:13.108 --> 56:14.980
Nice. That's nice.

56:15.023 --> 56:18.418
I don't know. I just don't
want to have any regrets,
you know?

56:18.462 --> 56:20.159
I wanna live a bunch
of different lives.

56:20.202 --> 56:22.291
What's the point of speaking
all these languages

56:22.335 --> 56:25.033
if I'm not gonna travel
the world and use them,
you know?

56:26.252 --> 56:32.127
Let's go.
We are going to watch
the fireworks on TV.

56:33.041 --> 56:34.521
Are your parents home?

56:37.263 --> 56:38.743
Do you want
to talk about it?

56:40.222 --> 56:41.528
Not really.

56:41.572 --> 56:42.790
Okay.

56:46.533 --> 56:49.188
My mom filed
for divorce today.

56:51.625 --> 56:53.279
I'm really sorry.

56:54.149 --> 56:58.545
You know,
I know this doesn't
help right now, but...

56:59.590 --> 57:01.243
just because
they're splitting up

57:01.287 --> 57:03.637
that doesn't mean that
they don't care
about each other.

57:03.681 --> 57:05.334
It means they've given up.

57:06.423 --> 57:09.730
I don't think that's fair.
Fair to who? You or them?

57:10.731 --> 57:14.822
[sighs] When you're
rowing a race and you get
to the last 20 meters,

57:17.782 --> 57:20.262
your entire body
is telling you to stop.

57:21.438 --> 57:25.311
Your muscles are on fire.
Your lungs are screaming at
you.

57:26.181 --> 57:30.098
Everything inside you
wants to quit,
make the pain go away.

57:32.449 --> 57:33.711
But if you want to win,

57:34.668 --> 57:38.193
that's exactly
when you dig deeper
and you row harder.

57:38.759 --> 57:40.718
You really don't like
to let things go, do you?

57:40.761 --> 57:43.198
You noticed?
[laughs]

57:46.288 --> 57:47.551
[fireworks boom]

57:49.335 --> 57:52.251
[whistling, booming]

57:55.254 --> 57:56.429
[sighs]

57:57.561 --> 58:00.912
You're just starting
to make me believe
in happy endings.

58:19.757 --> 58:22.368
Oh, no! The photo! No.
Oh, oh...

58:22.411 --> 58:25.066
What?
It's totally ruined.
It's totally ruined.

58:25.110 --> 58:27.068
Now you see why I don't
let anyone up here.

58:27.112 --> 58:29.941
I am pretty amazed
that you've let me
into your inner sanctum.

58:29.984 --> 58:32.944
Yeah, well,
if you tell anyone,

58:33.553 --> 58:34.641
I'll poison you.

58:39.559 --> 58:41.387
Oh, you don't have to...

58:42.388 --> 58:44.651
Hmm?
You don't have to look
through that.

58:44.695 --> 58:47.219
No, no, no. Okay.
Yeah.

58:50.614 --> 58:52.006
It's cool.

59:13.288 --> 59:14.768
I like this one.

59:22.863 --> 59:25.562
That's, um--
That's a cell phone tower.

59:26.650 --> 59:29.087
Yeah.
It's an allegory

59:29.130 --> 59:34.005
for something--
technology co-opting
our natural environment.

59:47.627 --> 59:48.889
Really?

59:49.629 --> 59:50.935
Really.

59:53.067 --> 59:57.637
I know you hate compliments,
but this work is incredible.

59:57.681 --> 1:00:01.162
I'm serious. It's like
you can see things
that no one else can.

1:00:01.206 --> 1:00:04.252
That just shows
how much you know
about photography.

1:00:04.296 --> 1:00:06.037
[laughs]

1:00:06.994 --> 1:00:08.735
I mean, I think
you can sell this stuff.

1:00:08.779 --> 1:00:11.433
Maybe on Etsy.

1:00:11.956 --> 1:00:14.045
There is something
that's missing

1:00:14.088 --> 1:00:16.221
from like all
of your photos.

1:00:16.264 --> 1:00:17.657
Yeah, I know.
It's color.

1:00:17.701 --> 1:00:19.920
No. You.

1:00:22.662 --> 1:00:25.012
I just don't really think
the world needs another
selfie.

1:00:25.056 --> 1:00:28.581
Oh, come on. What is wrong
with stepping in front of
the camera every once in
awhile.

1:00:28.625 --> 1:00:31.976
I believe that a
photographer should point
her lens outward,

1:00:32.803 --> 1:00:34.674
toward the world.
Yeah?

1:00:34.718 --> 1:00:36.850
Yeah, so you can try
and understand it.

1:00:36.894 --> 1:00:38.896
What about trying
to understand yourself?

1:00:39.810 --> 1:00:42.377
If you had my past,
you wouldn't ask that
question.

1:00:43.335 --> 1:00:44.902
You ever gonna
tell me about it?

1:00:46.686 --> 1:00:48.209
[chuckles]

1:00:49.471 --> 1:00:50.472
[sighs]

1:00:51.386 --> 1:00:53.040
Come on.
I'll walk you home.

1:00:54.694 --> 1:01:00.439
I never met my real father.
He ran off before I was
born.

1:01:00.482 --> 1:01:03.094
And my mom...

1:01:03.137 --> 1:01:07.402
The kind way to describe her
would be flaky.

1:01:08.926 --> 1:01:11.276
Wow.
Instead of
counting sheep

1:01:11.319 --> 1:01:13.060
to go to sleep
when I was a kid,

1:01:13.104 --> 1:01:15.410
I would count her fiancés.

1:01:16.977 --> 1:01:18.631
And Mel was
one of them?

1:01:19.371 --> 1:01:21.286
Yeah, he was
the last one.

1:01:21.329 --> 1:01:26.726
Her final victim before
she ghosted us for good.

1:01:26.770 --> 1:01:28.989
And that's when
he took you in?

1:01:29.555 --> 1:01:31.557
Well, he tried,
but the court,

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:34.386
they just didn't really
look too kindly on
a middle-aged bachelor

1:01:34.429 --> 1:01:36.388
wanting to adopt
a young girl.

1:01:36.431 --> 1:01:39.217
So then where did you go?

1:01:39.783 --> 1:01:41.610
Ah, Family Services.

1:01:42.089 --> 1:01:43.264
Foster care.

1:01:45.136 --> 1:01:46.093
Oh.

1:01:46.703 --> 1:01:48.922
You know how you said
that I notice things

1:01:48.966 --> 1:01:50.619
that no one else does?

1:01:50.663 --> 1:01:52.273
Mm-hmm.

1:01:52.317 --> 1:01:56.103
When you live with strangers
who can hurt you,

1:01:56.147 --> 1:01:57.975
and I bounced around a lot,

1:01:58.018 --> 1:02:01.630
you have to really just
observe everything.

1:02:01.674 --> 1:02:04.721
When you're a foster kid,
you learn the hard way to...

1:02:06.070 --> 1:02:07.767
Never put your guard down?

1:02:09.334 --> 1:02:10.727
Yeah.

1:02:11.162 --> 1:02:13.425
Anyway, about a year ago,
Mel and Vickie got married

1:02:13.468 --> 1:02:15.949
and then the court
let them take me in.

1:02:15.993 --> 1:02:18.517
So that's why you call
yourself a genetic stranger?

1:02:20.911 --> 1:02:23.827
[buzzing, clicking]

1:02:25.045 --> 1:02:27.831
I did that.
[scoffs]

1:02:27.874 --> 1:02:30.137
["One Day" playing]

1:02:58.862 --> 1:03:00.515
[Vickie] Good God.

1:03:01.342 --> 1:03:04.084
How early is it?
Super early.

1:03:04.737 --> 1:03:07.958
A little splash
of almond milk, right?

1:03:11.744 --> 1:03:13.050
Uh, yeah.

1:03:16.662 --> 1:03:18.011
I like your necklace.

1:03:18.055 --> 1:03:20.013
Yeah? Shannon
lent it to me.

1:03:21.188 --> 1:03:25.889
You know, if you ever
want to borrow anything from
me, clothes or makeup,
jewelry...

1:03:25.932 --> 1:03:27.499
All righty.

1:03:28.021 --> 1:03:30.067
I'll see you later, Vick.

1:03:33.984 --> 1:03:35.246
See ya.

1:03:54.004 --> 1:03:55.440
[shutter clicks]

1:04:00.662 --> 1:04:03.361
When a rower dies,
this is what heaven looks
like.

1:04:03.404 --> 1:04:08.975
For me, heaven is
Paris in the rain.
Like cobblestone streets.

1:04:09.019 --> 1:04:10.411
Yeah?
Yeah.

1:04:10.455 --> 1:04:13.806
Is everything
in black and white?

1:04:13.850 --> 1:04:15.895
Get out of my head.

1:04:17.288 --> 1:04:20.508
You ever been? To Paris?

1:04:20.552 --> 1:04:21.596
Someday.

1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:23.294
Avec moi?

1:04:24.295 --> 1:04:27.037
I guess I could use
a translator.

1:04:31.955 --> 1:04:33.826
My parents had
their honeymoon there.

1:04:34.696 --> 1:04:36.873
So I've been saving up
to send them

1:04:36.916 --> 1:04:38.700
for their 25th anniversary.

1:04:39.701 --> 1:04:43.270
What if they
don't want to go?
I mean, who doesn't want
to go to Paris?

1:04:43.314 --> 1:04:45.751
Yeah, but what if they don't
want to go with each other?

1:04:46.317 --> 1:04:49.450
It's not a crime
to fall out of love,
you know.

1:04:49.973 --> 1:04:51.539
Tessa.
Hmm?

1:04:51.583 --> 1:04:52.889
Love never dies.

1:04:55.717 --> 1:04:56.936
What?

1:04:58.764 --> 1:05:02.028
You just sound like someone
who's never been hurt by
life.

1:05:03.987 --> 1:05:05.379
You putting me on notice?

1:05:05.423 --> 1:05:07.164
[laughs] No.

1:05:12.647 --> 1:05:14.345
Um, what the hell is that?

1:05:14.388 --> 1:05:15.694
This...

1:05:17.783 --> 1:05:20.699
is a rowboat.
I'm assuming you want me
to get in that?

1:05:20.742 --> 1:05:24.007
You are getting
in this with me.
No.

1:05:24.050 --> 1:05:27.358
We spent four hours
in your dark room
doing what you love to do.

1:05:27.401 --> 1:05:29.186
Let me show you
what I love to do.

1:05:29.229 --> 1:05:32.058
[birds squawking,
chittering]

1:05:32.102 --> 1:05:34.756
[Tessa] Hands under your...
Thumbs there.
[Skylar] Thumbs here.

1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:38.325
And then it's gonna go
simple like that.
You press it down.

1:05:38.369 --> 1:05:41.676
Okay.
And then you tilt it
and then you pull it.

1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:44.462
Hmm.
And then you're
pressing down,

1:05:44.505 --> 1:05:46.594
tilt it,
and then pull it.

1:05:46.638 --> 1:05:49.206
Okay, I'm gonna try
and go forward again.
All right.

1:05:49.249 --> 1:05:50.729
Don't help me.
I won't.

1:05:50.772 --> 1:05:53.123
I won't. You've got this.
You've got this.

1:05:53.166 --> 1:05:54.776
[exhales sharply]

1:05:54.820 --> 1:05:56.256
[Tessa] Oh, my God!

1:05:56.300 --> 1:05:58.432
This is awful.
[Skylar laughs]

1:05:58.476 --> 1:06:01.174
Oh, I'm tired now.
You're flying!

1:06:01.218 --> 1:06:04.264
[Skylar playing harmonica]

1:06:29.289 --> 1:06:31.161
I love you, Tessa.

1:06:37.254 --> 1:06:39.517
[stammers softly]

1:06:49.440 --> 1:06:52.008
We should probably
head back, yeah?

1:07:05.369 --> 1:07:07.632
[slow pop music playing]

1:07:31.656 --> 1:07:33.701
[moans softly]

1:07:57.986 --> 1:08:00.206
[students chattering]

1:08:04.210 --> 1:08:05.385
Hey.

1:08:10.390 --> 1:08:11.913
"The in-between"?

1:08:11.957 --> 1:08:13.480
That's just what
Doris calls it,

1:08:13.524 --> 1:08:15.917
but every culture
has its own version of it.

1:08:15.961 --> 1:08:19.095
So, it's where we go
after we die.

1:08:19.138 --> 1:08:21.271
Not me. I'm going
to Jamaica.

1:08:21.314 --> 1:08:23.099
I'm serious, Shannon.

1:08:23.142 --> 1:08:25.275
It's like a waiting room
for our souls.

1:08:25.318 --> 1:08:26.972
Okay, so you think Skylar

1:08:27.015 --> 1:08:29.757
is reaching out to you
from this waiting room?

1:08:29.801 --> 1:08:33.544
They were color photos,
Shannon. I don't...
I don't shoot in color.

1:08:33.587 --> 1:08:36.155
I don't even own
the chemicals to develop it.

1:08:36.199 --> 1:08:39.506
But you can't show me
the photos?
No, I told you.

1:08:39.550 --> 1:08:41.813
The fixer didn't work.
I don't know why.

1:08:41.856 --> 1:08:46.296
But maybe spirits
can't be captured on film
or something. I don't know.

1:08:47.166 --> 1:08:48.385
All right.

1:08:50.561 --> 1:08:52.606
Tess, I want
to believe you,
I swear,

1:08:52.650 --> 1:08:56.306
but messages
from the other side?

1:08:57.524 --> 1:08:59.657
I just think he wants
the same thing I want.

1:09:01.441 --> 1:09:06.359
To see me one last time
so that we can actually
say goodbye to each other.

1:09:07.273 --> 1:09:09.536
You loved him,
and he knew that.

1:09:09.580 --> 1:09:11.103
What more is there to say?

1:09:11.147 --> 1:09:13.105
[teacher]
Two-minute warning.

1:09:13.149 --> 1:09:14.454
Please take your seats

1:09:14.498 --> 1:09:16.630
and set your phones
to silent mode.

1:09:16.674 --> 1:09:18.284
Dude, we need
to focus, okay?

1:09:18.328 --> 1:09:19.764
You're not even
listening to me.

1:09:19.807 --> 1:09:22.070
Yes, I am!
I just don't think

1:09:22.114 --> 1:09:25.509
this is about color photos
or waiting rooms
or the in-between.

1:09:25.552 --> 1:09:28.773
Then what is it about?
A girl who won't let go.

1:09:30.731 --> 1:09:33.604
Just think about it.
Okay?

1:09:35.083 --> 1:09:36.433
[door close]

1:09:53.798 --> 1:09:54.929
[sighs]

1:10:07.420 --> 1:10:08.595
[laughs]

1:10:10.597 --> 1:10:11.642
Sorry.

1:11:07.001 --> 1:11:09.003
[ringtone:
"Never Tear Us Apart"]

1:11:09.047 --> 1:11:11.571
Cell phone use is prohibited
during the test!

1:11:13.269 --> 1:11:15.619
[ringtone spreads to
all cell phones,
overlapping]

1:11:15.662 --> 1:11:17.185
[students murmuring]

1:11:52.873 --> 1:11:55.223
Didn't I tell you
the drive would be worth it?

1:11:55.963 --> 1:11:58.792
This negative's made of
glass. It's coated in
collodion,

1:11:58.836 --> 1:12:02.492
then dipped in silver
nitrate, which is crazy.

1:12:02.535 --> 1:12:05.451
Because after that,
you only ave a few minutes
to take the photo

1:12:05.495 --> 1:12:07.453
or the chemicals
completely dry up.

1:12:07.497 --> 1:12:10.369
Hmm. That's exactly
what I was gonna say.

1:12:11.239 --> 1:12:12.980
It's only ten grand.

1:12:13.024 --> 1:12:14.678
It's a little
out of my budget.

1:12:14.721 --> 1:12:17.985
But I can offer you
a gluten-free cracker

1:12:18.029 --> 1:12:21.728
with rotting cheese on it.
You're so generous.
it's crazy.

1:12:21.772 --> 1:12:23.251
Sorry. Am I interrupting?

1:12:23.295 --> 1:12:25.341
No. Julian, hi.

1:12:25.384 --> 1:12:28.213
We were just talking about
how much we love the photo.
Oh, yeah.

1:12:28.256 --> 1:12:29.780
It's wonderful, isn't it?

1:12:29.823 --> 1:12:31.825
I just love how
he prioritizes

1:12:31.869 --> 1:12:33.784
mood and atmosphere
over subject.

1:12:33.827 --> 1:12:36.743
That is a very sophisticated
insight for a girl your age.

1:12:36.787 --> 1:12:40.094
Julian, meet my very
sophisticated girlfriend.

1:12:40.138 --> 1:12:42.053
Hi, I'm Tessa.
Nice to meet you.

1:12:42.096 --> 1:12:45.056
Congratulations on this.
This is great.
Oh, thank you.

1:12:45.099 --> 1:12:49.974
Okay, kids, follow me.
I wanna show you something.

1:12:58.286 --> 1:13:02.160
Doesn't it look amazing
all lit up like this?

1:13:02.203 --> 1:13:06.164
Like it belongs here?
It does belong here.

1:13:06.730 --> 1:13:09.820
Tessa, you have
an extraordinary eye.

1:13:11.561 --> 1:13:13.519
I don't understand.

1:13:13.563 --> 1:13:17.393
It's for sale
for $1,000.

1:13:17.436 --> 1:13:20.613
Yeah, and we already have
two serious inquiries.

1:13:20.657 --> 1:13:24.312
[heartbeat thumping]
Uh, this photo

1:13:25.226 --> 1:13:29.056
is not for sale.
This was a gift to Skylar.

1:13:29.100 --> 1:13:30.797
Can't you print
another one?

1:13:30.841 --> 1:13:32.582
I really just don't want
anyone looking at it.

1:13:32.625 --> 1:13:33.887
Can we please take it down?

1:13:35.236 --> 1:13:36.716
Are you serious?

1:13:37.413 --> 1:13:39.632
Take it down.
Hey, it's okay.
I'll take it down.

1:13:39.676 --> 1:13:40.851
Thank you.

1:13:40.894 --> 1:13:43.114
[heartbeat continues]

1:13:45.769 --> 1:13:48.554
[no audible dialogue]
[train whistle blows]

1:13:48.598 --> 1:13:50.469
That's exactly why
I brought you here,

1:13:50.513 --> 1:13:53.951
to prove
that your photos are great,
even Julian thinks so.

1:13:53.994 --> 1:13:56.214
I don't want this photo
hanging on the wall

1:13:56.257 --> 1:13:58.477
of some random stranger.

1:13:58.521 --> 1:13:59.957
This is my photo.

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.176
That means I get to decide
who I share it with

1:14:02.220 --> 1:14:03.874
and I shared it with you.

1:14:05.484 --> 1:14:06.485
You're right.

1:14:07.007 --> 1:14:08.966
I'm sorry. I should have
asked you first.

1:14:09.009 --> 1:14:10.881
I just wanted you to see
how amazing you are.

1:14:10.924 --> 1:14:14.145
And that you can
get into RISD.

1:14:15.363 --> 1:14:17.017
Who said anything
about RISD?

1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:21.979
Shannon said your art
teacher thought you could
get in.

1:14:22.022 --> 1:14:25.678
I'm gonna kill her.
It is the best art college
in the country.

1:14:25.722 --> 1:14:28.986
And it's in Providence,
which is in the same city
as Brown.

1:14:29.029 --> 1:14:31.205
Which if you get in,
we could be together.

1:14:31.249 --> 1:14:33.556
I--
For real.
Without a ticking clock.

1:14:33.599 --> 1:14:36.210
Even if I could
get into RISD,

1:14:36.254 --> 1:14:38.125
which I totally doubt,

1:14:38.169 --> 1:14:41.302
I cannot afford that.
You're going to
get into RISD.

1:14:41.346 --> 1:14:43.653
No.
And you could just
get a scholarship.

1:14:43.696 --> 1:14:46.830
Skylar, Jesus,
just give it up.

1:14:46.873 --> 1:14:49.572
This is--
You can't fix everything.

1:14:49.615 --> 1:14:50.921
What?

1:14:50.964 --> 1:14:53.358
Your parents' marriage
and me.

1:14:54.141 --> 1:14:56.274
Some things are
just beyond repair.

1:14:56.317 --> 1:14:58.015
Is that why you
won't say you love me?

1:15:00.844 --> 1:15:04.238
Because you're...
beyond repair.

1:15:09.548 --> 1:15:10.767
Okay.

1:15:11.550 --> 1:15:12.769
That's...

1:15:20.864 --> 1:15:24.041
[machinery rattling]
[chattering on screen]

1:15:50.850 --> 1:15:52.678
[phone chimes]

1:16:48.604 --> 1:16:50.736
[knocking on door]
[pop music
playing on stereo]

1:16:50.780 --> 1:16:52.999
[footsteps approaching]

1:16:54.261 --> 1:16:57.743
Hey,00. I'm here
like you asked. What's up?

1:16:57.787 --> 1:16:59.919
I would like to take
your portrait.

1:17:01.138 --> 1:17:05.621
Uh... can I change first?
No, you don't have to.
You can just put that on.

1:17:06.491 --> 1:17:07.710
What's that?

1:17:08.841 --> 1:17:10.756
It was my mom's.

1:17:18.155 --> 1:17:19.983
This really brings me
back to college.

1:17:20.810 --> 1:17:25.205
I had a boyfriend
who was an art major.
Made me pose for him.

1:17:25.249 --> 1:17:31.124
So... Mel isn't the first
person that you've been in
love with.

1:17:33.213 --> 1:17:36.042
Gosh, no.
I've loved a few men.

1:17:36.086 --> 1:17:38.915
Maybe even one woman.

1:17:41.613 --> 1:17:46.531
Did you love any of them
more than they loved you?

1:17:46.574 --> 1:17:48.620
Oh, probably.

1:17:48.664 --> 1:17:49.969
Didn't that scare you?

1:17:50.883 --> 1:17:55.583
Knowing that someone
could you hurt you more
than you could hurt them?

1:17:55.627 --> 1:17:57.629
Yeah. Maybe at first.

1:17:57.673 --> 1:18:00.980
But then I think I realized
if you protect yourself
from the lows,

1:18:01.024 --> 1:18:04.680
you just end up missing
all the highs too.

1:18:08.031 --> 1:18:09.946
You love Skylar. Don't you?

1:18:15.125 --> 1:18:17.344
I think I'm screwing it up.

1:18:18.650 --> 1:18:23.133
Yeah. If it's not
opening old wounds,
it's probably not true love.

1:18:24.917 --> 1:18:26.440
I just don't
know what to do.

1:18:27.790 --> 1:18:30.967
How do I get Skylar
to understand that...

1:18:32.577 --> 1:18:34.318
I love him. [chuckles]

1:18:36.668 --> 1:18:38.496
You start by saying it.

1:18:41.020 --> 1:18:43.327
You need to hear
the words, Tessa.

1:18:44.067 --> 1:18:45.938
You mean, he needs
to hear the words.

1:18:45.982 --> 1:18:49.463
No. You need to hear
yourself say them.

1:18:51.378 --> 1:18:52.728
Out loud.

1:18:53.859 --> 1:18:56.470
So the world knows
your feelings count.

1:18:58.342 --> 1:18:59.517
That you count.

1:19:05.653 --> 1:19:07.177
Vickie, I'm sorry.

1:19:08.874 --> 1:19:10.746
For how I've treated you.

1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:27.023
Hey Google, dim the lights.

1:19:27.763 --> 1:19:30.243
Yes!
Oh, man.
No smoke machine?

1:19:30.287 --> 1:19:31.331
Shh!

1:19:32.071 --> 1:19:33.899
We begin this invocation

1:19:33.943 --> 1:19:36.336
by asking the
Archangel Michael

1:19:36.380 --> 1:19:38.861
to protect us against
any malevolent spirits

1:19:38.904 --> 1:19:42.603
that may be seeking a
gateway into this earthbound
sphere.
You wrote this?

1:19:43.213 --> 1:19:45.171
You're interrupting
my invocation.
I'm sorry!

1:19:45.215 --> 1:19:46.825
It's just-- This is crazy.

1:19:46.869 --> 1:19:48.609
Did you read all of
these books in two days?

1:19:48.653 --> 1:19:51.830
Bitch, yes!
You know speed reading
is my super power.

1:19:51.874 --> 1:19:54.920
Enjoy Your Own Funeral.

1:19:54.964 --> 1:19:58.097
Yeah. That happens
to be a classic

1:19:58.141 --> 1:20:01.144
of the paranormal
metaphysical genre.

1:20:01.187 --> 1:20:02.841
Now hush.
Okay.

1:20:02.885 --> 1:20:05.713
[pop music playing]

1:20:05.757 --> 1:20:07.541
We seek to communicate

1:20:07.585 --> 1:20:11.807
only with the disembodies
spirit formerly known as
Skylar Adams.

1:20:12.982 --> 1:20:14.853
No other spirits, please.

1:20:16.376 --> 1:20:17.377
Okay.

1:20:18.726 --> 1:20:22.774
A Ouija board?
Please, Tess.
This is a planchette.

1:20:22.818 --> 1:20:25.603
There's a pencil tip
attached to the bottom.

1:20:25.646 --> 1:20:28.954
We ask questions
and Skylar communicates
by moving our hands.

1:20:28.998 --> 1:20:31.000
Just like he did in the gym.

1:20:31.043 --> 1:20:33.045
Here. Fingers right there.

1:20:34.046 --> 1:20:35.569
Okay.

1:20:35.613 --> 1:20:37.223
Close your eyes.

1:20:40.009 --> 1:20:43.882
[gasps]
Oh, my God, it moved.
Sorry that was me. My bad.

1:20:43.926 --> 1:20:46.580
It's called scrying.
The deceased use the mirror

1:20:46.624 --> 1:20:48.887
as a gateway to the world
of the living.

1:20:48.931 --> 1:20:54.110
All you have to do is
stare into the mirror
in a trance-like state.

1:20:54.980 --> 1:20:57.069
That's it.
Okay.

1:21:05.861 --> 1:21:08.559
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Can we cover up
Gambino and Drake?

1:21:08.602 --> 1:21:10.778
They're like really
distracting me.

1:21:10.822 --> 1:21:12.563
Instrumental
Trans-Communication.

1:21:12.606 --> 1:21:16.175
The spirit uses the TV
monitor as a bridge to our
world.

1:21:16.219 --> 1:21:18.786
What is this? Okay.
Here you go.

1:21:18.830 --> 1:21:21.006
Blocks out the gamma rays.

1:21:26.533 --> 1:21:27.795
Do you see anything?

1:21:27.839 --> 1:21:29.362
No. Do you?

1:21:30.581 --> 1:21:31.582
No.

1:21:31.625 --> 1:21:33.540
[sighs]

1:21:35.673 --> 1:21:37.936
[both sigh]

1:21:39.285 --> 1:21:41.418
Maybe I should have
read more books.

1:21:42.114 --> 1:21:44.943
No. No, you've been awesome.

1:21:44.987 --> 1:21:46.466
[phone chimes]

1:21:47.554 --> 1:21:49.992
[sighs] Oh, man.
It's just Vickie.

1:21:50.035 --> 1:21:52.255
Needs the car.
She has a shift.

1:21:53.734 --> 1:21:56.346
Okay. I'll walk you out.

1:21:57.521 --> 1:21:58.652
Okay.

1:22:02.004 --> 1:22:05.616
[faint, high
-pitched humming]

1:22:18.672 --> 1:22:21.110
[electric warbling]
[voice murmuring]

1:22:25.027 --> 1:22:26.245
Hello?

1:22:29.031 --> 1:22:31.381
[murmuring continues]

1:22:36.952 --> 1:22:39.650
[GPS] Your route
is being calculated.

1:22:41.304 --> 1:22:46.352
Proceed for four miles
to the entrance to
Highway 85 South.

1:22:53.490 --> 1:22:55.274
It's a map.
[door opens, closes]

1:22:55.318 --> 1:22:57.711
["Closer" playing]

1:23:03.717 --> 1:23:06.198
Tessa? Tessa!

1:23:06.242 --> 1:23:09.636
Sorry! I've gotta do this.

1:23:09.680 --> 1:23:10.811
Tessa!

1:23:10.855 --> 1:23:11.987
[tires screeching]

1:23:13.336 --> 1:23:19.516
[GPS] Head southwest
to I-95 South,
and proceed for 106 miles.

1:23:21.561 --> 1:23:24.129
Continue straight
for six miles.

1:23:39.492 --> 1:23:42.278
[GPS] Take the next right,
and in 100 feet,

1:23:42.321 --> 1:23:45.150
your destination
will be on your right.

1:23:50.895 --> 1:23:53.463
[GPS] You have arrived
at your destination.

1:23:53.506 --> 1:23:55.204
[heartbeat thumping]

1:24:02.167 --> 1:24:05.431
I told you he
wasn't gone yet.

1:24:05.475 --> 1:24:07.738
[laughs] Doris!

1:24:07.781 --> 1:24:11.046
[chuckles] Come. Sit.

1:24:14.571 --> 1:24:17.878
You know,
I love coming out here at
night

1:24:17.922 --> 1:24:20.968
to watch the shooting stars.

1:24:21.012 --> 1:24:24.189
My angels are
calling me home.

1:24:26.235 --> 1:24:28.454
Skylar knows
the end is near.

1:24:31.153 --> 1:24:33.111
You don't have much time.

1:24:33.155 --> 1:24:35.287
He's been communicating
with you?

1:24:35.331 --> 1:24:38.508
Well, I'm much closer
to his world than you are.

1:24:39.161 --> 1:24:40.901
[chuckles]

1:24:41.380 --> 1:24:42.773
What does he want?

1:24:43.208 --> 1:24:44.470
My help.

1:24:46.211 --> 1:24:48.431
To bring
the two of you together.

1:24:49.171 --> 1:24:50.476
Can you?

1:24:55.177 --> 1:24:57.179
Please.

1:25:01.661 --> 1:25:06.797
In ancient folklore,
the souls of the departed

1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:12.933
returned to places
where they experienced
their greatest moments of
love.

1:25:13.717 --> 1:25:20.071
That's where they were able
to cross the life-death
barrier.

1:25:20.115 --> 1:25:23.683
Now, perhaps if
you and Skylar went back

1:25:23.727 --> 1:25:29.298
to where you felt
the most love,

1:25:30.603 --> 1:25:34.868
the window between worlds
might open?

1:25:36.696 --> 1:25:37.741
Okay.

1:25:38.481 --> 1:25:39.786
But be careful.

1:25:41.614 --> 1:25:44.574
If you do manage
to cross the barrier...

1:25:46.445 --> 1:25:48.360
there may be no way back.

1:25:53.452 --> 1:25:56.847
[hip-hop music playing
over speakers]
[teenagers laughing,
chattering]

1:26:05.638 --> 1:26:07.031
Tess?

1:26:07.074 --> 1:26:08.206
What's up?

1:26:08.815 --> 1:26:11.340
This is not how I wanted
my summer to go.

1:26:11.383 --> 1:26:13.777
Oh, no, what do you mean?
What's wrong?

1:26:14.386 --> 1:26:16.345
They're so cute together,
it's stupid.

1:26:16.388 --> 1:26:17.650
Who's cute?

1:26:18.869 --> 1:26:22.002
Oh. Is that Judd?
[Shannon] That's Judd.

1:26:22.046 --> 1:26:24.179
Oh...
My vagina is weeping.

1:26:24.222 --> 1:26:27.269
They are cute,
but I'm so sorry.

1:26:27.878 --> 1:26:28.922
That's terrible.

1:26:28.966 --> 1:26:30.663
Oh, my God!
What?

1:26:30.707 --> 1:26:33.362
Billy Hodges
came to my party?

1:26:34.580 --> 1:26:36.669
Ciao, Billy.

1:26:39.933 --> 1:26:41.631
Hey.
Hey.

1:26:43.502 --> 1:26:45.548
[sighs] It's
just three words.

1:26:51.293 --> 1:26:52.772
Hi.

1:26:59.344 --> 1:27:04.219
Can we go somewhere
to talk for a second, alone?

1:27:04.262 --> 1:27:06.525
Sure.
[both chuckle]

1:27:06.569 --> 1:27:08.701
Yo, brutha!Hey.

1:27:08.745 --> 1:27:11.008
[Cortez]
I just heard the good news.
What news?

1:27:11.051 --> 1:27:12.618
Um...
Oregon State!

1:27:14.098 --> 1:27:16.579
Nothing's official yet.
Oh, bullshit, bro.

1:27:16.622 --> 1:27:21.323
No, I just talked
to the new coach. He said
it's as good as done.

1:27:21.975 --> 1:27:23.325
Come on.

1:27:24.326 --> 1:27:26.458
Um...Okay.

1:27:26.502 --> 1:27:30.593
Tess? Tess? Tessa?

1:27:30.636 --> 1:27:33.987
Tess, I was gonna
tell you, I swear.
When?

1:27:35.250 --> 1:27:38.165
When were you gonna tell me?
After I got into RISD?
No, of course not.

1:27:38.209 --> 1:27:42.909
I just didn't want to give
you another reason to back
out.
What about our plan?

1:27:43.693 --> 1:27:46.086
The same city?
No more ticking clock?

1:27:46.130 --> 1:27:48.872
You weren't even gonna
send in an application.

1:27:50.134 --> 1:27:52.354
I applied last week.

1:27:55.531 --> 1:28:00.057
Well, thank you for waiting
until the last possible
moment to tell me.

1:28:03.321 --> 1:28:04.670
[sighs]

1:28:04.714 --> 1:28:08.065
The truth is, Tess,
my dad's not...

1:28:08.108 --> 1:28:09.936
He's not doing that well.

1:28:11.242 --> 1:28:15.681
He's really lonely in Oregon
and I feel like I should
stay with him for awhile.

1:28:15.725 --> 1:28:19.642
Oregon is on the other side
of the country.

1:28:19.685 --> 1:28:23.167
How were we ever
gonna see each other?
It'll be hard.

1:28:23.210 --> 1:28:27.824
I'm not switching schools
permanently. I'm not!

1:28:27.867 --> 1:28:30.914
And if you get into RISD,
and you will,

1:28:30.957 --> 1:28:33.220
I'll be in Providence
before you are.

1:28:33.264 --> 1:28:36.920
What happens if you start
to like Oregon? What happens
if your team starts to win?

1:28:36.963 --> 1:28:39.357
Tess, my dad
needs me right now.

1:28:39.401 --> 1:28:41.185
He's my family. I don't--

1:28:42.099 --> 1:28:45.842
[exhales]
You don't understand
about family because--

1:28:47.583 --> 1:28:49.498
Because I don't have one.

1:28:49.541 --> 1:28:51.891
That is not what
I meant to say.

1:28:54.851 --> 1:28:56.809
I knew this was
gonna happen.

1:28:58.637 --> 1:29:01.423
I get close to people
and they disappear on me.

1:29:01.945 --> 1:29:03.990
This is just what
happens to me.

1:29:04.034 --> 1:29:04.948
Tess.
No.

1:29:06.253 --> 1:29:07.298
No.

1:29:08.343 --> 1:29:10.867
You're just gonna push me
away like you do everyone?

1:29:15.524 --> 1:29:17.482
The summer is over, Skylar.

1:29:19.528 --> 1:29:21.051
And so are we.

1:29:28.232 --> 1:29:30.103
[horn honking]

1:29:32.497 --> 1:29:36.936
Hey.
Your ghost-hunting assistant
has arrived.

1:29:37.372 --> 1:29:39.809
Here you go.
Direct from Daddy's closet.

1:29:39.852 --> 1:29:45.292
Yeah, this is full spectrum,
motion sensor, night vision.

1:29:45.336 --> 1:29:46.685
Perfect. Thank you.

1:29:47.686 --> 1:29:49.253
Who gave you all the swag?

1:29:49.296 --> 1:29:52.169
Ah, Vickie's credit card.

1:29:52.212 --> 1:29:55.390
Whoa! Tessa's a
bad, bad girl.

1:29:55.433 --> 1:29:58.523
Bye.
Hey, if there are nudes
of my mom on that camera,

1:29:58.567 --> 1:30:00.046
I do not want to know.

1:30:00.090 --> 1:30:03.180
[whispers]
Shh. I'm gonna tell you.

1:30:41.914 --> 1:30:43.873
[seagulls squawking]

1:31:25.305 --> 1:31:26.959
[sighs]

1:31:31.834 --> 1:31:33.226
[exhales sharply]

1:31:42.888 --> 1:31:45.630
[faint, high-pitched hum]

1:34:02.114 --> 1:34:05.161
[gasping]

1:34:11.471 --> 1:34:12.777
[police radio chatter]

1:34:12.821 --> 1:34:14.257
[officer]
Central, standby.

1:34:14.953 --> 1:34:16.694
You Tessa Benson?

1:34:23.745 --> 1:34:25.398
I can't believe
you tracked my phone.

1:34:25.442 --> 1:34:27.313
The day you stole
Vickie's credit card

1:34:27.357 --> 1:34:29.315
was the day you gave up
your right to privacy.

1:34:29.359 --> 1:34:32.928
What were you doing
at the hotel so late?
I was taking photos.

1:34:32.971 --> 1:34:36.105
I told you that.
What, are you trying to put
yourself back in the
hospital?

1:34:36.148 --> 1:34:39.325
I don't understand this.
Things were so much better
this summer.

1:34:39.369 --> 1:34:41.850
We started to feel
like a family.
Do you not understand?

1:34:41.893 --> 1:34:45.592
Geez, I wonder what happened
at the end of the summer
that might change my mood.

1:34:45.636 --> 1:34:48.291
You know what I've been
through? What Vickie's been
through?
Stop.

1:34:48.334 --> 1:34:51.207
Love hurts.
You learn to live with it.
Fuck off, Mel.

1:34:51.250 --> 1:34:53.296
Hey, no! You don't get
to talk to him like that.

1:34:53.339 --> 1:34:56.081
Not after everything
he's done for you.
There's no...

1:34:57.648 --> 1:34:58.693
Tessa!

1:34:58.736 --> 1:35:00.912
[ultrasound warbling]

1:35:06.526 --> 1:35:08.311
She's ruptured the repair.

1:35:08.354 --> 1:35:12.271
Is it any wonder? The way
she's been running around
all crazy.

1:35:12.315 --> 1:35:16.232
You can see right here.
There's a fair amount of
blood accumulated around her
heart.

1:35:16.275 --> 1:35:18.756
Will she be all right?
Not until we
drain the chamber

1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:20.671
and reinforce
the original suture.

1:35:20.715 --> 1:35:23.326
We're gonna schedule you
for an OR first thing
in the morning.

1:35:23.369 --> 1:35:27.330
No, no, I-- I'm not--
You gotta let me go.
You need to let me go.

1:35:27.373 --> 1:35:29.985
Tessa! 50 milligrams now.
[Tessa] Jasmine, no!
Don't, please!

1:35:30.028 --> 1:35:33.075
Tessa, if I let you go home,
you won't make it
through the night.

1:35:33.118 --> 1:35:36.382
You don't understand.
You don't understand.
Get some rest now, honey.

1:35:36.426 --> 1:35:39.429
I never got to tell...
tell him.

1:35:40.735 --> 1:35:41.779
Tell him what?

1:35:41.823 --> 1:35:43.433
That...

1:36:07.326 --> 1:36:10.199
They can never, ever
tear us apart.

1:36:10.721 --> 1:36:13.506
["Never Tear Us Apart"

1:36:15.813 --> 1:36:17.336
[song continues on ringtone]

1:36:38.488 --> 1:36:39.489
Tess?

1:36:40.011 --> 1:36:41.926
[groans] Shan, is that you?

1:36:41.970 --> 1:36:45.190
Are you okay?
You-- You sound medicated.

1:36:45.234 --> 1:36:48.498
I'm at the hospital.
What happened?

1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:52.023
I saw him, Shan.

1:36:52.067 --> 1:36:54.852
No way.
At the hotel.

1:36:55.461 --> 1:36:58.116
I couldn't touch him,
but he was there.

1:37:00.379 --> 1:37:03.556
I just have one place left
that I have to go.

1:37:04.383 --> 1:37:06.995
The lake.
Where he told you
he loved you.

1:37:07.865 --> 1:37:10.172
I just don't really have
much time left.

1:37:10.215 --> 1:37:12.130
Okay, stay put. I'm coming.

1:37:21.923 --> 1:37:23.315
Whoa.

1:37:24.926 --> 1:37:26.753
Now what?
I don't know.

1:37:26.797 --> 1:37:28.625
[electrical crackling]

1:37:28.668 --> 1:37:31.846
Room 22.
I'll take him.

1:37:31.889 --> 1:37:34.457
[chiming]
Oh. Ooh, two more.

1:37:34.500 --> 1:37:36.894
[chiming continues]
Witching hour.
I'll take odds,

1:37:36.938 --> 1:37:38.156
you take evens.
Yeah.

1:37:41.551 --> 1:37:43.074
[elevator dings]

1:37:43.858 --> 1:37:45.816
Whoa.
Let's go.

1:37:46.382 --> 1:37:47.949
I could get used to this.

1:37:58.089 --> 1:37:59.308
[elevator dings]

1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:04.443
[security guard]
Hey! What are you doing?

1:38:04.487 --> 1:38:06.402
Go, go, go.
Come on.

1:38:07.229 --> 1:38:08.360
Oh, God.

1:38:18.501 --> 1:38:20.459
Whoa. What the hell?

1:38:22.505 --> 1:38:25.247
[tires squealing]

1:38:33.429 --> 1:38:35.344
The lake is that way.
You've gotta turn around.

1:38:35.387 --> 1:38:38.521
I know. I know!
It's the wrong way!
Please turn around.

1:38:38.564 --> 1:38:40.044
I can't.

1:38:41.872 --> 1:38:43.569
Let go.
What?

1:38:43.613 --> 1:38:45.006
Let go!

1:38:49.532 --> 1:38:52.230
[horns honking]

1:38:54.667 --> 1:38:56.669

1:38:57.540 --> 1:38:59.672
I want a dead boyfriend too.

1:39:08.681 --> 1:39:10.292
[door opens, closes]

1:39:12.163 --> 1:39:16.646
What are you doing here?
Skylar says he's called you
and left you a ton of
messages.

1:39:17.908 --> 1:39:21.433
So?
So? You're ghosting
your soul mate?

1:39:21.477 --> 1:39:24.088
Shannon, my past is always
just gonna get in the way.

1:39:24.132 --> 1:39:26.873
Remember last year,
you'd spotted
that condemned bridge

1:39:26.917 --> 1:39:29.006
and just had to get a photo.

1:39:29.050 --> 1:39:31.530
You had to jump
into the water,

1:39:31.574 --> 1:39:33.880
even though it was
freezing cold.

1:39:34.533 --> 1:39:35.970
You know what
I was thinking,

1:39:36.753 --> 1:39:40.539
when I saw you down there
swimming against the current
to get your photo,

1:39:40.583 --> 1:39:43.890
"Imagine if Tess could
be like this for her life,

1:39:43.934 --> 1:39:45.196
and not just for her art."

1:39:47.807 --> 1:39:50.636
He's leaving tonight, Tess.

1:40:05.738 --> 1:40:07.131
Lock up for me.

1:40:42.123 --> 1:40:44.473
[tires screeching]

1:40:47.128 --> 1:40:49.347
[thunder rumbling]

1:40:57.355 --> 1:40:59.662
This is where
the accident happened.

1:40:59.705 --> 1:41:01.751
Do you know why
he brought you here?

1:41:03.013 --> 1:41:04.232
No.

1:41:04.971 --> 1:41:06.277
I don't know.

1:41:07.191 --> 1:41:08.627
But I'm gonna find out.

1:41:10.107 --> 1:41:11.413
Tess?

1:41:21.684 --> 1:41:22.685
Tess!

1:41:24.774 --> 1:41:26.210
Oh, my God.

1:41:29.083 --> 1:41:31.302
I need help!

1:41:35.393 --> 1:41:37.091
[line ringing]

1:41:38.004 --> 1:41:40.137
[dispatcher]
911, what's your emergency?

1:41:40.181 --> 1:41:42.748
[Shannon]
My friend just passed out.
She has a heart condition.

1:41:42.792 --> 1:41:46.970
I'm at the corner
of 6th and Channel,
please send somebody!

1:41:47.013 --> 1:41:48.363
[Tessa] Skylar!

1:41:54.195 --> 1:41:55.370
Tess.

1:41:55.413 --> 1:41:57.633
You forgot your hat.
[chuckles]

1:42:01.245 --> 1:42:02.899
I'm so sorry, Sky.

1:42:03.900 --> 1:42:05.119
I'm sorry. I'm...

1:42:06.076 --> 1:42:10.080
[sighs] I should have
talked to you before
making any decisions.

1:42:10.124 --> 1:42:14.128
No. You shouldn't have to
explain loving your family.

1:42:14.737 --> 1:42:18.654
If I hadn't spent my whole
life just pushing everyone
away, I would have
understood that.

1:42:18.697 --> 1:42:21.135
No, come on, Tess.
I love you.

1:42:22.092 --> 1:42:23.398
[chuckles]

1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:25.095
I said it.

1:42:25.139 --> 1:42:27.445
Would you mind
if I said it again?

1:42:33.930 --> 1:42:35.236
I love you.

1:42:45.420 --> 1:42:47.683
[horn honking]
[Tessa screams]

1:43:07.311 --> 1:43:08.704
[Skylar] Hey.
[gasps]

1:43:13.230 --> 1:43:15.711
It's you.
It's me.

1:43:17.843 --> 1:43:19.410
Oh, my God.

1:43:33.163 --> 1:43:35.383
[siren wailing in distance]

1:43:37.341 --> 1:43:40.388
I love you.
I know.

1:43:40.431 --> 1:43:43.304
You told me.
I love you.

1:43:43.347 --> 1:43:46.524
So that's why
you brought me here?

1:43:46.568 --> 1:43:48.657
So that I'd know?

1:43:49.397 --> 1:43:51.790
Yeah. No regrets.

1:43:59.233 --> 1:44:00.495
So, is this...

1:44:01.931 --> 1:44:05.064
Is this it?
We're still in Avalon.

1:44:05.108 --> 1:44:06.631
Not exactly.

1:44:06.675 --> 1:44:10.026
It's like everything
you see is a memory,

1:44:10.069 --> 1:44:14.422
a dream that we have,
to project it onto the
world.

1:44:15.553 --> 1:44:17.033
It's kinda cool.

1:44:17.773 --> 1:44:19.992
Come on. I'll show you.

1:44:20.036 --> 1:44:21.603
Okay.

1:44:22.778 --> 1:44:25.868
[paramedics,
Shannon chattering]

1:44:33.136 --> 1:44:35.312
[speaking French]

1:44:39.229 --> 1:44:41.275
[speaking French]

1:45:18.790 --> 1:45:21.576
[doctors, nurses chattering]

1:45:27.625 --> 1:45:30.976
I came out here
the first day I met you.

1:45:33.196 --> 1:45:36.112
My parents had just told me
about the separation.

1:45:36.982 --> 1:45:39.333
Felt like it was
the worst day of my life.

1:45:43.424 --> 1:45:44.903
And then I met you.

1:45:45.730 --> 1:45:47.906
And it was probably
the best day of my life.

1:45:49.081 --> 1:45:50.344
Mine too.

1:46:43.135 --> 1:46:47.096
[Dr. Sarkisian]
There's nothing more we can
do. She has a decision to
make.

1:46:47.139 --> 1:46:49.141
She has to want to live.

1:46:49.707 --> 1:46:52.928
Come back, Tess.
Come back, Tess...

1:47:16.517 --> 1:47:19.041
[crying]

1:47:19.955 --> 1:47:20.999
Hey.

1:47:24.046 --> 1:47:25.177
What's wrong?

1:47:32.010 --> 1:47:35.666
I've spent my whole life
learning how not to get
hurt.

1:47:36.754 --> 1:47:38.843
And that's no way to live.

1:47:42.151 --> 1:47:47.069
But... But even with
all the hurt that I feel
right now...

1:47:50.594 --> 1:47:52.074
I don't regret a thing.

1:47:54.555 --> 1:47:56.165
Because I love you.

1:47:58.733 --> 1:48:01.387
And knowing that I'm capable
of feeling this way,

1:48:01.431 --> 1:48:03.041
makes life worth living.

1:48:06.654 --> 1:48:08.699
I don't want
to say goodbye.

1:48:09.439 --> 1:48:10.962
You don't have to.

1:48:14.313 --> 1:48:16.490
Love never dies.

1:48:25.324 --> 1:48:26.761
[sighs]

1:48:26.804 --> 1:48:28.240
I'm gonna miss you.

1:48:29.981 --> 1:48:32.506
[sobbing]
I'm gonna miss you.

1:48:44.909 --> 1:48:47.303
Go give us
a happy ending, yeah?

1:49:06.496 --> 1:49:07.845
Hey.

1:49:11.153 --> 1:49:13.198
No more dying, okay?

1:49:14.286 --> 1:49:15.679
[chuckles]

1:49:30.302 --> 1:49:32.174
Oh, my God.
It smells so good.

1:49:32.217 --> 1:49:34.568
Sit down. There's plenty.
I can't. I gotta go.

1:49:35.220 --> 1:49:36.874
Good luck, Tessa.
Love you.

1:49:36.918 --> 1:49:39.050
Go get 'em.
All right, bye.

1:49:39.094 --> 1:49:40.791
See you later!

1:49:42.097 --> 1:49:44.403
Ever since I was
a little girl,

1:49:44.447 --> 1:49:48.233
people always told me that
I see things
that no one else does.

1:49:48.277 --> 1:49:52.455
It wasn't just that
my camera was a way for me
to express myself.

1:49:53.064 --> 1:49:57.547
It was the means by which
I captured the unseen.

1:49:58.113 --> 1:50:02.160
It was only recently
that I discovered something
that I had been blind to.

1:50:05.033 --> 1:50:06.077
A ghost.

1:50:08.689 --> 1:50:11.474
All of us,
each and every one of us,

1:50:11.517 --> 1:50:13.258
are haunted by ghosts.

1:50:14.085 --> 1:50:17.393
The ghosts of
childhood trauma.

1:50:19.264 --> 1:50:22.006
The ghosts of
unfulfilled dreams.

1:50:22.833 --> 1:50:25.183
The ghosts of lost love.

1:50:27.751 --> 1:50:31.102
Like so many people,
I believed that,

1:50:31.146 --> 1:50:33.888
if I just ignored
these ghosts,

1:50:33.931 --> 1:50:36.194
they would
eventually go away.

1:50:37.065 --> 1:50:39.197
This turned out
to be a mistake.

1:50:41.199 --> 1:50:43.462
Just like all of
our worst fears,

1:50:43.506 --> 1:50:48.511
these invisible spirits
gain strength in darkness.

1:50:49.555 --> 1:50:53.255
If we run from them,
they run faster.

1:50:53.298 --> 1:50:56.911
If we push them away,
they just push back harder.

1:50:56.954 --> 1:50:58.477
What are we supposed to do?

1:51:01.698 --> 1:51:03.352
It has taken...

1:51:04.527 --> 1:51:07.095
great personal loss

1:51:07.748 --> 1:51:10.054
for me to discover the
answer to this question.

1:51:13.144 --> 1:51:15.973
We must attend
to our ghosts.

1:51:16.844 --> 1:51:20.717
We must welcome them
into our lives

1:51:20.761 --> 1:51:24.895
as though they are part of
us, because they are part of
us.

1:51:29.291 --> 1:51:33.991
It's only when we
acknowledge their presence
will they make room for new
possibilities.

1:51:36.124 --> 1:51:39.823
In the end,
I've learned that our ghosts
are part of who we are,

1:51:39.867 --> 1:51:41.390
part of who we hope to be.

1:51:43.087 --> 1:51:45.873
These hauntings
stay inside us,

1:51:45.916 --> 1:51:48.745
tethered to our
hearts forever.

1:51:50.573 --> 1:51:51.966
In life.

1:51:53.576 --> 1:51:54.838
In death.

1:51:55.752 --> 1:51:59.800
And... everywhere
in-between.
