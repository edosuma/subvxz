01:07.233 --> 01:08.526
All personnel,

01:08.610 --> 01:10.820
proceed to
your command stations immediately.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.408
Assessment.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.079
Scanners have yet to detect any signs
of a sub-orbital defense system.

01:19.454 --> 01:22.999
Planetary surface reports indicate
offensive capability, extremely low.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.418
Begin the assault.

02:01.663 --> 02:02.539
Fire.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.601
Move, move, move!

02:26.563 --> 02:28.273
Power the surface-to-air blasters.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.483
Dispatch the first wave
of Garrison fighters.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.068
Prep the next wave immediately.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.238
Wait! We can't use the standard defenses.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.323
We're going to hit those aliens

02:37.407 --> 02:40.410
with hundreds of thousands of pounds
of thermobaric missiles

02:40.702 --> 02:43.538
and finish them off with the best pilots
the world has to offer.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.709
They don't stand a chance out there.
We need to scramble the MFE fighters.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.336
The pilots of the MFEs
are just cadets.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.297
So are the pilots of Voltron.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.091
Launch base defenses
according to protocol.

02:55.842 --> 02:56.676
Commander.

02:59.554 --> 03:03.099
I know you have wartime authorization,
but maybe we should listen to--

03:03.182 --> 03:04.100
That's an order.

03:04.851 --> 03:08.897
We can't risk the planet on untested
military weaponry piloted by cadets.

03:11.149 --> 03:15.486
This is Commander Iverson.
Initiate base defense protocol, Beta-Five.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.866
I repeat,
initiate base defense protocol, Beta-Five.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.120
You heard the man. We're up.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.635
You've just doomed those men and women.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.332
Our weapons have no effect!

04:12.627 --> 04:14.128
Evasive maneuvers!

04:17.214 --> 04:19.968
Wildcat's gone. Titan's not responding.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.346
I can't shake these things.
He’s got me on target lock.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.640
Hang in there!
I'm heading your way!

04:25.723 --> 04:27.392
I can't-- No!

04:28.810 --> 04:31.896
Be aware, another Galra fleet
is launching and approaching.

04:38.653 --> 04:39.821
I’ve got target lock.

04:40.738 --> 04:41.572
No!

04:51.374 --> 04:54.585
This is Commander Sendak
of the Fire of Purification.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.796
I am here for the Voltron Lions.

04:56.879 --> 05:00.383
Turn them over to me
or I will destroy your planet.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.845
- Open a line.
- Yes, Admiral.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.015
This is Admiral Sanda of Earth.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.393
We have received your communication
requesting the Voltron Lions.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.646
Please be advised
that our planet is not harboring them

05:13.730 --> 05:15.273
nor do we know where they are.

05:15.773 --> 05:16.941
We'll see.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.946
Tell all Garrison bases
to call back fighters.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.866
All Garrison bases are under attack.
They're not responding.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.659
They've already scrambled fighters.

05:36.627 --> 05:37.670
Battle report.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.714
The planet has offered little resistance,

05:39.797 --> 05:42.133
with the exception
of this single location.

05:42.216 --> 05:45.344
It appears to be utilizing
particle barrier technology.

05:46.095 --> 05:48.222
Focus all firepower on that shield.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.683
The ion cannon will make short work of it.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.606
Sir, it looks like the alien ships
are focusing in on our location.

05:56.689 --> 06:00.318
Scramble the MFE-Ares fighters.
Begin powering up the fusion cannon.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.235
Yes, sir.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.739
I will court-martial you if you utter
one command against my orders.

06:04.822 --> 06:08.326
There won't be a court to try me in
if we don't listen to Commander Holt.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.539
MFE-Ares pilots,
begin loading sequence.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.502
Activate interlock.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.421
Dynotherms connected.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.840
Mega-thrusters are go.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.315
We're ready to depart on your mark,
Commander Iverson.

06:39.857 --> 06:40.691
Three...

06:41.192 --> 06:42.026
Two...

06:42.693 --> 06:43.528
One...

06:43.986 --> 06:44.821
Mark!

06:55.748 --> 06:57.416
They’re scrambling fighters,
Commander.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.710
Fire the ion cannon.

07:14.183 --> 07:17.061
The particle barrier shows no signs
of structural damage.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.565
Okay, team, we've trained for this.

07:20.648 --> 07:23.359
We know their maneuvers
and have the firepower to knock them out.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.237
-Leifsdottir, you're my wing.
-10-4.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.449
Rizavi, you and Kinkade
keep those fighters off our back.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.366
Copy.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.748
-Fusion cannon online.
-Fire!

07:43.880 --> 07:45.798
Direct hit. Target destroyed.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.802
-Fusion cannon status report.
-It's drained substantial power.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.430
Estimating enough for two more shots
before recharge, sir.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.307
Sendak doesn't know that.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.435
The cannon appears to be charging
for another shot.

07:57.518 --> 08:00.688
This is the only place on the planet
well-defended.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.648
Fall back out of its range.

08:03.357 --> 08:05.818
We will attack where they are vulnerable.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.947
The entire fleet
is pulling out.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.283
They're focusing their attacks
on the remaining cities.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.701
Update the rest of the globe.

08:13.784 --> 08:16.370
They need to evacuate
to safe zones immediately.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.582
We should go after them.
Your weapons actually mounted an offense.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.835
The fighters are only short range
and the cannon is immobile.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.546
If we leave its proximity,
we'd be decimated.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.508
Sir, communication
with all of Western Europe has gone dark.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.678
Russia. China. India.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.515
East Coast Base, please acknowledge, over.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.893
Can anyone
on the East Coast respond? Over.

08:39.727 --> 08:40.561
Please?

08:45.983 --> 08:48.819
Scouting reports
show no signs of the Voltron Lions.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.072
Shall we continue the occupation, sir?

08:51.822 --> 08:54.325
Yes, the Paladins will return.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.786
And we'll be waiting for them.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.792
Commander, we are no longer receiving
responses on any channels.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.252
What are your orders?

09:08.214 --> 09:10.466
The Galra just delivered a critical blow.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.720
I know many of you in this room
feel we should press our attack.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.682
And believe me when I say
I wish we could.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.476
Even with all we've accomplished,

09:20.560 --> 09:23.437
we're still not ready
to fight the Galra head-on.

09:23.521 --> 09:27.692
However, while this base stands,
Earth still has a chance.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.069
I believe in each and every one of you.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.614
You made it here because of your ability
to overcome adversity.

09:33.948 --> 09:38.035
And now the freedom of planet Earth
is dependent on that ability.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.496
Everyone break to their sub-commands.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.623
I want a full status update of this base.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.584
We will prevail.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.798
When this is all said and done,

09:51.048 --> 09:52.842
I'm going to have you both
stripped of your rank

09:52.925 --> 09:55.052
and thrown in the brig
for defying my orders.

09:55.928 --> 09:56.804
Yes, ma'am.

09:58.264 --> 10:02.059
Now, we don't have the Lions.
Why is Sendak still invading?

10:02.977 --> 10:04.520
You don't understand the Galra.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.274
They've been conquering the universe
for over 10,000 years.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.735
Sendak must have a plan.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.154
Supplies are limited.

10:13.237 --> 10:16.198
We don't have enough food to sustain us
for more than a couple of months.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.075
And construction materials?

10:18.159 --> 10:20.494
Do we have enough
to complete the IGF-Atlas?

10:20.745 --> 10:21.621
Negative.

10:21.996 --> 10:22.830
Quiznak.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.083
We can't give up. Voltron will come.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.669
We just need to get supplies
and wait out Sendak.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.131
Well, there is a supply depot
not too far from here.

10:32.381 --> 10:34.008
It was abandoned during the initial attack

10:34.091 --> 10:36.135
and the Galra haven't occupied
that area yet.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.679
But how would we transport the supplies?

10:39.764 --> 10:41.932
We could use
the underground tunnel system.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.976
It's an older setup from World War III.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.604
The trains haven't been used since,
but the tunnels are sound

10:46.687 --> 10:49.774
and the tracks are still intact
and run directly beneath the base.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.567
If we were to send a small team,

10:51.651 --> 10:54.320
we could load up supplies
onto one of the old trains,

10:54.403 --> 10:56.405
repair it and ride it directly back here.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.158
What does Galra activity
in that area look like?

11:00.034 --> 11:02.662
None currently, but judging by
the Galra's movements,

11:02.745 --> 11:04.163
that won't last long.

11:04.246 --> 11:05.873
It's hard to give an exact estimate.

11:06.207 --> 11:09.919
Their occupation efforts seem to be
focused on major metropolitan areas,

11:10.002 --> 11:14.048
but they're scattering out
in what look like random patrol patterns.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.134
Then our team
will have to move quickly.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.930
- Okay, I'll drive.
- I'm coming with you.

11:22.431 --> 11:25.226
Name's Veronica.
I'm an analyst and your handler.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.686
We don't need a handler.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.647
Do you know how to get to the depot?

11:29.980 --> 11:33.150
Well, no, but, you know,
I'll just use the guidance system.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.070
That uses the world communication network.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.656
Which, oh, yeah, these tunnels
were designed to block.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.199
And Cadet Rizavi should drive.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.410
She has the highest marks
with the AW-Cruiser.

11:42.993 --> 11:43.828
I like her.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.621
Oh, and shotgun.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.790
I really like her.

12:01.095 --> 12:01.929
Left here.

12:06.016 --> 12:06.851
All clear.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.024
Right.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.069
These tracks
are a straight shot to the depot.

12:31.625 --> 12:32.543
Let's get to work.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.131
They left her in pretty good shape.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.341
I think we'll have her running
in under an hour.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.115
Griffin checking in. What's your status?

13:03.407 --> 13:05.159
Supplies are 95 percent loaded.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.536
Rizavi here. Almost done with repairs.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.710
We've got company,
just south of the Cruiser.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.170
Copy. On our way.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.535
Our weapons have no effect on them.

13:51.747 --> 13:54.667
Go! Get the train running.
I'll hold them off.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.527
You two, get this thing started.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.070
Kinkade, you're with me.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.671
Train's up and running. Let's go.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.716
Veronica, get in here!

14:48.470 --> 14:50.014
Veronica! What are you doing?

14:50.347 --> 14:51.432
Just go!

14:53.392 --> 14:55.686
We're not gonna leave her. Stop the train.

14:57.688 --> 14:58.522
No!

15:14.747 --> 15:15.915
She saved the mission.

15:16.457 --> 15:17.291
And us.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.628
Does anyone know how to get back?

15:21.795 --> 15:23.172
Two lefts, two rights,

15:23.422 --> 15:27.301
left, middle tunnel, right, left,
and then one more right.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.658
Thank goodness you're back.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.618
Wait.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.328
Where's Veronica?

15:55.746 --> 15:57.915
She... She didn't make it.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.045
Her sacrifice will not be in vain.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.005
We have a chance now.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.091
A chance for what?

16:07.466 --> 16:10.469
We just bought ourselves time.
What is that gonna do for us?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.639
Voltron will come.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.559
You really believe that?

16:18.894 --> 16:19.728
Yes.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.440
And in the meantime, we need to finish
our work on the IGF-Atlas

16:23.524 --> 16:25.109
and figure out a way to power it.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.362
She'll be sorely needed
when we liberate the planet.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.872
Begin the next phase of the assault.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.458
Destroy their communications network.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.711
Forgive me for questioning your orders,

16:44.128 --> 16:46.046
but why are we cutting off
their communications?

16:46.672 --> 16:49.216
Do we not want Voltron
to hear the distress signal?

16:49.466 --> 16:52.136
When you hear an animal
crying out in pain,

16:52.219 --> 16:53.804
you proceed with caution.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.432
Silence promotes haste.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.406
He's destroying all of our satellites.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.577
He's cutting off our communication
with the outside world.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.996
And all we can do is watch.

17:25.461 --> 17:29.089
Commander, how should the fleet proceed
regarding the last stronghold?

17:29.965 --> 17:32.176
Time will conquer them for us.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.920
It seems we will have enough raw material

18:08.003 --> 18:10.631
to complete the superstructure
for the IGF-Atlas.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.508
How's morale?

18:13.092 --> 18:13.967
It's low.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.553
We're using every trick in the book
to keep spirits high,

18:17.054 --> 18:19.181
but when the world
is in the shape it's in...

18:20.307 --> 18:24.186
If the IGF-Atlas becomes operational,
do you think it could defend Earth?

18:24.728 --> 18:27.272
She's been outfitted
with all our most advanced weaponry,

18:27.731 --> 18:29.358
but it's still just one ship,

18:29.817 --> 18:31.318
and an untested one at that.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.949
This is Commander Holt, over.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.743
Sir, you’re gonna wanna come
to the hangar to see this.

18:52.047 --> 18:52.923
Oh, Veronica.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.135
It's great to see you.

18:59.763 --> 19:02.307
Veronica, you're alive. How?

19:03.183 --> 19:04.601
These people saved me.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.646
I've been working
with an underground resistance network.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.065
The network is small, but highly mobile.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.068
And they've gathered a great deal
of intel and supplies

19:13.152 --> 19:15.487
that could prove extremely useful to us.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.865
Their intel even led me to my family.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.492
So I led them here.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.203
I thought we should be working together.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.622
Your brother would be very proud of you.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.333
Speaking of Lance...

19:28.417 --> 19:30.752
Have you heard anything? From Voltron?

19:31.795 --> 19:33.213
No. Not yet.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.632
And supplies are getting dangerously low.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.553
What you've brought will certainly help,
but only for so long.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.306
I'm afraid I've got more bad news
to add to that.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.434
I have some intel
from the resistance network.

19:46.185 --> 19:50.397
The Galra have begun to group able-bodied
citizens together into work camps.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.066
They're utilizing them for manual labor.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.819
Reports indicate
that construction has begun

19:55.903 --> 19:58.697
on multiple Galran installations
around the globe.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.576
We need to get
one last message out to Voltron.

20:08.081 --> 20:12.211
Commencing launch
in ten, nine, eight,

20:12.711 --> 20:16.548
-seven, six, five, four...
-Let's hope you're right about this.

20:17.090 --> 20:20.052
...three, two, one.

20:25.098 --> 20:25.933
Liftoff.

20:42.699 --> 20:45.077
Sir, the base has launched a projectile.

20:45.911 --> 20:46.912
Destroy it.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.224
Yes! We did it!

21:07.599 --> 21:09.101
He fell for it.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.855
I'm picking up a signal.
They're broadcasting.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.358
They're micro transmitters,
millions of them,

21:16.566 --> 21:18.026
spreading throughout the sector.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.403
What are they broadcasting?

21:20.487 --> 21:22.823
To any beings
who receive this message,

21:22.906 --> 21:25.284
planet Earth has been overrun by Galra.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.411
Most of the citizens have been captured.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.080
Those of us remaining
are making our last stand.

21:30.455 --> 21:33.959
If you get this message,
please get word to Voltron.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.335
We need help.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.756
So they do think Voltron will return.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.053
Earth has been conquered.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.307
We are the last holdout
in an evil occupation.

21:49.182 --> 21:52.853
And we must face facts.
Our supplies are running out.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.939
They have hammered us
and hurt the ones we love.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.984
Our backs are completely up
against the wall.

22:00.110 --> 22:03.613
And nothing makes us more dangerous.

22:05.032 --> 22:08.618
We only have enough resources
for one last stand.

22:09.119 --> 22:12.289
Regardless of the outcome,
if we stand united,

22:12.372 --> 22:15.500
we will let them know
that planet Earth, our home,

22:15.584 --> 22:17.919
will not go down without a fight.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.110
Well, what are we waiting for?

22:43.305 --> 22:49.380
