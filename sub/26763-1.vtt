01:08.936 --> 01:12.712
- And over again, screaming
the F word in my face.

01:12.712 --> 01:13.545
Faggot,

01:14.648 --> 01:17.863
and it wasn't from the pain of the hitting

01:17.863 --> 01:21.497
or the word, god knows I've
heard that my whole life,

01:21.497 --> 01:23.975
but it was the fact that it was him,

01:23.975 --> 01:27.642
someone that I loved,
instead of a stranger.

01:33.813 --> 01:34.813
- Hi, there.

01:36.437 --> 01:38.772
You coming to join us?

01:38.772 --> 01:39.605
- Sorry.

01:41.700 --> 01:44.783
- One second, hang on, you guys, hey.

01:47.957 --> 01:48.790
Hey, hey.

01:49.865 --> 01:51.109
I know you.

01:51.109 --> 01:54.037
- No, I'm looking for someone,

01:54.037 --> 01:56.149
a girl, dark hair, kind of stand offish.

01:56.149 --> 01:58.020
- That's most of us here.

01:58.020 --> 02:00.261
- Yeah, she's different.

02:00.261 --> 02:02.917
- Wait, wait, I know you, though.

02:02.917 --> 02:05.061
Right, I know your face or something.

02:05.061 --> 02:06.062
- Maybe.

02:06.062 --> 02:07.673
- How?

02:07.673 --> 02:09.747
- Killed some people.

02:16.821 --> 02:19.525
- These are
gonna help you remember.

02:19.525 --> 02:23.275
Well, that is, whichever
one of you survives.

02:28.229 --> 02:30.396
Trust me, one of you will.

02:35.023 --> 02:37.919
See, the problem with memories,

02:37.919 --> 02:41.086
is the further you get away from them,

02:42.643 --> 02:45.107
the more they change,

02:45.107 --> 02:46.940
so you need reminders,

02:48.211 --> 02:50.960
something tangible, something that helps

02:50.960 --> 02:53.877
you keep the memory alive and well.

02:55.344 --> 02:57.177
Pictures, so tangible.

03:07.572 --> 03:08.655
Look at this.

03:10.901 --> 03:11.984
Look at that.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.555
Don't be so angry.

03:17.555 --> 03:19.909
I'm doing this for you.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.355
So you can remember.

03:22.355 --> 03:25.438
So you can remember and never forget.

03:31.286 --> 03:32.119
So pretty.

03:37.492 --> 03:39.575
So good at what she does.

03:45.895 --> 03:47.978
Let me ask you something.

03:50.327 --> 03:51.910
Do you feel heroic?

03:53.624 --> 03:55.957
Could you be a hero for her?

03:59.225 --> 04:01.475
Would you die for her, huh?

04:28.971 --> 04:30.183
- Boo.

04:30.183 --> 04:31.016
- Tim.

04:33.015 --> 04:35.862
- Hey, I mean, who else, right?

04:35.862 --> 04:39.695
Wow, man, smells of BO
and depression in here.

04:41.943 --> 04:45.026
Well, Nosferatu, you gonna let me in?

04:47.623 --> 04:51.373
All right, well how
about coming on out then?

04:53.863 --> 04:54.696
Scott?

04:55.814 --> 04:59.718
Seriously, come on, I'll buy you coffee.

04:59.718 --> 05:01.718
Whoa, whoa, pants first.

05:05.768 --> 05:06.889
Yeah.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.095
- Hey, Tim, wait here, please.

05:09.095 --> 05:11.262
- Yeah, okay, sure.
- Okay.

05:26.275 --> 05:27.971
- You look like shit.

05:27.971 --> 05:28.804
- Thanks.

05:30.434 --> 05:31.435
- Too blunt?

05:31.435 --> 05:33.268
- Yeah, just a little.

05:34.450 --> 05:36.450
- You getting any sleep?

05:38.515 --> 05:42.682
Is that an "I don't know"
or "I don't really care"?

05:43.731 --> 05:44.564
Oh, cool.

05:45.491 --> 05:48.115
Thanks for clearing that up.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.610
What about her parents?

05:50.610 --> 05:52.899
- They don't really want
anything to do with me.

05:52.899 --> 05:55.747
They just keep to themselves.

05:55.747 --> 05:57.830
I don't blame 'em really.

05:59.347 --> 06:01.443
- Well, they got each other.

06:01.443 --> 06:02.776
What do you got?

06:13.237 --> 06:16.320
What about one of those group things?

06:18.881 --> 06:21.714
What you call it, a support thing?

06:22.706 --> 06:26.039
- I don't really need anybody else, Tim.

06:27.608 --> 06:28.608
- Bull shit.

06:29.907 --> 06:33.251
Okay, you've got a guilty
conscience or nightmares

06:33.251 --> 06:36.754
or whatever, fine, that's your deal,

06:36.754 --> 06:38.291
but don't you for one fucking second

06:38.291 --> 06:41.347
try to tell me that
you don't need anybody,

06:41.347 --> 06:43.027
because sure as shit a month from now,

06:43.027 --> 06:44.291
when I haven't heard from you

06:44.291 --> 06:46.019
and I gotta get the cops
to open up your door,

06:46.019 --> 06:48.579
only to find your brains
painting the walls,

06:48.579 --> 06:52.995
it's gonna be too goddamn
late to say I told you so.

06:52.995 --> 06:56.354
So please, for the sake of my virgin soul,

06:56.354 --> 06:59.954
don't put me through that shit, man.

06:59.954 --> 07:01.912
Let me be the same asshole friend

07:01.912 --> 07:05.186
I've always been and let
me feel good about myself

07:05.186 --> 07:09.764
because I got you off your
ass and into recovery, huh?

07:17.736 --> 07:20.549
Yeah, this coffee tastes like shit.

07:41.907 --> 07:43.491
- I'm sorry.

07:43.491 --> 07:44.324
- Why?

07:53.333 --> 07:55.250
- It's okay, it's okay.

07:58.474 --> 07:59.641
It's not okay.

08:00.677 --> 08:01.894
It's not okay.

08:04.047 --> 08:04.880
It's not.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.417
- Not for you?

08:25.566 --> 08:26.567
- Excuse me?

08:26.567 --> 08:27.808
- You're not going in.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.744
- It's the wrong place.

08:29.744 --> 08:32.336
- Uh huh, good luck with that.

08:38.679 --> 08:42.006
Sitting off from the group now.

08:42.006 --> 08:45.921
Got any other bad trips you're going for?

08:45.921 --> 08:47.375
- Real supportive.

08:47.375 --> 08:48.530
- What?

08:48.530 --> 08:50.030
- Real supportive.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.596
- And?

08:52.596 --> 08:54.817
- For a support group.

08:54.817 --> 08:57.039
- Oh, these thing are total garbage.

08:57.039 --> 09:00.193
I just like calling
outsiders on their shit.

09:00.193 --> 09:01.634
- Then what are you doing here?

09:01.634 --> 09:03.216
- Good, good, good.
- Yeah.

09:03.216 --> 09:04.501
- Would you mind getting the door please?

09:04.501 --> 09:05.501
- Oh, sure.

09:05.501 --> 09:06.501
- Thank you.

09:10.738 --> 09:12.571
We're in a safe space.

09:13.521 --> 09:15.700
Whatever exists in the outside world

09:15.700 --> 09:19.533
and wants to cause you
harm stops at the door.

09:20.837 --> 09:25.138
This is an environment
free of judgment and fear,

09:25.138 --> 09:28.319
where we're all welcome
to share or just listen,

09:28.319 --> 09:30.097
whatever you're comfortable with.

09:30.097 --> 09:34.772
My name is Paul and I welcome
you all to our sanctuary.

09:34.772 --> 09:36.913
- Hi, Paul.
- Thank you, Paul.

09:36.913 --> 09:38.784
- Thank you, Paul.

09:38.784 --> 09:39.617
- Hello.

09:41.712 --> 09:42.785
- Hi.

09:42.785 --> 09:43.618
- Welcome.

09:44.740 --> 09:45.573
- Thanks.

09:46.642 --> 09:47.475
- And you?

09:48.880 --> 09:50.577
Glad you've returned.

09:50.577 --> 09:51.410
- Uh uh.

09:53.585 --> 09:54.418
- Well.

09:55.889 --> 09:59.032
Would anyone like to
share any recent struggles

09:59.032 --> 10:02.365
or successes you've had in recent weeks?

10:05.811 --> 10:07.169
You don't need to raise your hand.

10:07.169 --> 10:08.833
- Yeah, I'm curious.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.449
- Your name?

10:10.449 --> 10:12.032
- What, no I'm not.

10:14.179 --> 10:15.012
I'm Scott.

10:16.546 --> 10:17.713
- Welcome, Scott.

10:17.713 --> 10:20.385
- Welcome, Scott.

10:20.385 --> 10:21.218
- Thanks.

10:23.455 --> 10:26.321
So I'm curious how long
you have people been coming

10:26.321 --> 10:27.889
here for.

10:27.889 --> 10:30.641
- It ranges anywhere from a few months

10:30.641 --> 10:33.391
to going on two years for myself.

10:34.257 --> 10:35.090
- Years?

10:36.305 --> 10:37.839
- Some people find themselves dropping in

10:37.839 --> 10:41.921
from time to time as a way
to recharge your batteries,

10:41.921 --> 10:43.793
or even measure your growth.

10:43.793 --> 10:46.528
- Does anyone ever stop?

10:46.528 --> 10:47.529
- Stop?

10:47.529 --> 10:48.753
- Stop coming.

10:48.753 --> 10:51.086
Does anyone ever get better?

10:53.489 --> 10:57.605
- It's not really a one and done solution.

10:57.605 --> 10:59.407
This is support.

10:59.407 --> 11:01.183
We help each other.

11:01.183 --> 11:04.404
Through our common bonds,
the things that unite us.

11:04.404 --> 11:05.237
- Tragedy.

11:06.548 --> 11:07.761
- Birds of a feather.

11:07.761 --> 11:09.678
- Misery loves company.

11:10.608 --> 11:14.775
- I notice some trepidation
coming from you, doubt.

11:16.832 --> 11:19.539
Your trauma was recent.

11:19.539 --> 11:21.633
- Are you asking?

11:21.633 --> 11:23.550
- Don't really have to.

11:26.479 --> 11:28.497
Please, if you would share with the group

11:28.497 --> 11:30.830
what brought you here today.

11:33.778 --> 11:35.528
Someone close to you.

11:36.881 --> 11:37.964
- My husband.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.363
Car accident.

11:42.979 --> 11:47.146
- I'm Joe, my brother died
from a heroin overdose.

11:48.785 --> 11:51.780
- I'm Sherri, I lost my
sister six months ago

11:51.780 --> 11:53.280
to a drunk driver.

11:55.553 --> 11:58.053
- Tragedy can shape our lives,

11:59.423 --> 12:04.084
but so to happiness can shape
our experience of death.

12:04.084 --> 12:06.084
- Tell that to the dead.

12:08.516 --> 12:10.117
- You blame yourself.

12:10.117 --> 12:10.950
- What?

12:12.193 --> 12:16.418
- I sense that you carry
a lot of blame with you.

12:16.418 --> 12:18.835
Do you feel a responsibility?

12:20.084 --> 12:20.917
- No.

12:22.735 --> 12:25.156
- Please, don't close up.

12:25.156 --> 12:28.768
It's important that you
remain open and honest,

12:28.768 --> 12:29.777
even if you're scared.

12:29.777 --> 12:31.194
- I'm not scared.

12:32.928 --> 12:34.368
I'm not.

12:35.745 --> 12:36.578
I'm done.

12:49.364 --> 12:50.819
What?

12:52.531 --> 12:53.667
What?

12:58.115 --> 12:58.948
Stupid.

13:08.578 --> 13:09.411
What?

13:11.347 --> 13:12.659
- Why?

13:14.883 --> 13:17.411
- Hey, thank you for returning.

13:17.411 --> 13:18.244
- Sure.

13:19.554 --> 13:21.763
- I know it might not seem like much

13:21.763 --> 13:25.508
but it really is big accomplishment.

13:25.508 --> 13:26.425
Sorry, I...

13:28.615 --> 13:30.532
Door please, thank you.

13:33.043 --> 13:35.667
Now, we're all in a safe place.

13:35.667 --> 13:37.026
Whatever exists in the outside world

13:37.026 --> 13:40.435
that wants to bring you
harm stops at the door.

13:40.435 --> 13:44.003
This is an environment free of judgment.

13:44.003 --> 13:46.499
- It's like everybody else knows now,

13:46.499 --> 13:48.999
and the blood is in the water,

13:49.843 --> 13:52.420
and the sharks are coming out to feed

13:52.420 --> 13:54.804
and they just keep picking at me,

13:54.804 --> 13:57.221
like piece by piece by piece.

13:58.163 --> 14:01.026
- A predatory response is not uncommon

14:01.026 --> 14:04.053
for survivors, sort of a resentment

14:04.053 --> 14:05.429
from the rest of the world.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.179
- But I'm the victim.

14:10.098 --> 14:11.848
- Something to share?

14:15.860 --> 14:17.557
Do you feel like a victim?

14:17.557 --> 14:18.474
- Fuck off.

14:19.843 --> 14:21.461
Sorry, didn't mean to make it--

14:21.461 --> 14:22.706
- No, no, it's all right.

14:22.706 --> 14:24.179
It's a knee jerk reaction, I'm sure,

14:24.179 --> 14:27.075
but it's part of a
guard you're putting up.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.675
- Well, yeah, you have to keep up a guard

14:28.675 --> 14:30.008
otherwise you...

14:33.426 --> 14:34.843
- Otherwise what?

14:36.099 --> 14:39.315
- Otherwise you become a victim forever,

14:39.315 --> 14:41.763
and I don't want that.

14:41.763 --> 14:43.698
- Well then what do you want?

14:43.698 --> 14:45.115
Put a name to it.

14:48.295 --> 14:49.128
- Justice.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.819
But there's no such thing.

14:52.819 --> 14:54.275
- What makes you say that?

14:54.275 --> 14:55.797
- Because does anybody ever get it?

14:55.797 --> 14:57.214
I don't get mine.

14:59.330 --> 15:03.970
I wake up every single
morning in a cold sweat.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.403
I see things that aren't there.

15:06.403 --> 15:09.035
I live in constant fear
that he is at my door

15:09.035 --> 15:10.419
and that he's coming back.

15:10.419 --> 15:12.919
- They do come back, the dead.

15:14.691 --> 15:17.858
To remind us what they gave up for us,

15:18.914 --> 15:21.507
or what we gave them up for.

15:21.507 --> 15:23.250
- What?

15:23.250 --> 15:26.836
- I was saying that justice
can come in many forms.

15:26.836 --> 15:28.610
Are you familiar with the philosophy

15:28.610 --> 15:32.738
that the best revenge
is to lead a good life?

15:32.738 --> 15:34.291
- Night.

15:34.291 --> 15:36.067
- If you were given the chance

15:36.067 --> 15:38.650
to get your justice, would you?

15:40.818 --> 15:42.235
- Hypothetically?

15:46.563 --> 15:47.480
Yeah, sure.

15:48.450 --> 15:50.644
- He gave you a choice.

15:50.644 --> 15:52.098
I know what happened to you.

15:52.098 --> 15:53.490
- No, you don't.

15:53.490 --> 15:54.883
You didn't have a psycho in your house,

15:54.883 --> 15:57.682
taking pictures, spouting philosophy.

15:57.682 --> 15:59.099
- How did it end?

16:04.482 --> 16:06.482
Come back inside.

16:06.482 --> 16:07.315
Share that

16:08.867 --> 16:12.117
and I'll let you in on a little secret.

16:15.490 --> 16:16.490
- All right.

16:17.911 --> 16:18.828
I'll do it.

16:21.203 --> 16:25.120
I was coming home and I
was excited to see her,

16:26.866 --> 16:30.699
my fiancee, and there
was a knock at the door.

16:36.503 --> 16:37.836
She answered it,

16:40.135 --> 16:41.385
and he hit her,

16:42.504 --> 16:45.337
and I tried to fight back but I...

16:51.230 --> 16:53.147
He caught me off guard,

16:54.653 --> 16:56.403
and then he bound us,

16:59.375 --> 17:00.875
and threatened us.

17:05.184 --> 17:06.351
Took pictures.

17:08.270 --> 17:10.936
He asked me would I die for her.

17:16.996 --> 17:18.246
And I said yes.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.892
And it didn't matter.

17:25.789 --> 17:27.289
I watched her die,

17:28.932 --> 17:32.849
and there was nothing
that I could do about it.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.340
And then, he just left.

17:44.488 --> 17:48.199
And I was alone with her body for so long.

17:53.639 --> 17:56.222
And I just stared right at her,

17:59.786 --> 18:01.953
and she stared back at me.

18:05.556 --> 18:06.806
She still does.

18:10.467 --> 18:12.467
- Thank you for sharing.

18:13.778 --> 18:15.945
- I don't feel any better.

18:17.331 --> 18:18.531
- It takes time.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.691
- I'm running out.

18:20.691 --> 18:24.353
- Don't let the
darkness overtake you.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.270
- What if I want it to?

18:30.099 --> 18:32.766
- So here's the damnedest thing.

18:33.908 --> 18:36.882
You and I share the same monster.

18:41.109 --> 18:44.835
Physical traits, any
details you can remember.

18:44.835 --> 18:45.837
- No, I can't.

18:45.837 --> 18:46.837
It's a blur.

18:46.837 --> 18:48.403
One minute he's six feet tall in my mind,

18:48.403 --> 18:50.883
and the next, he's barely six inches.

18:50.883 --> 18:52.882
It shifts, nothing's concrete.

18:52.882 --> 18:53.799
- Hispanic?

18:54.833 --> 18:55.835
- I don't know.

18:55.835 --> 18:56.914
- Mark on his wrist?

18:56.914 --> 18:57.916
- Yeah, maybe.

18:57.916 --> 19:00.371
- Takes Polaroids while
spouting philosophy.

19:00.371 --> 19:01.373
- Yes, but it--

19:01.373 --> 19:02.290
- It's him.

19:04.579 --> 19:06.412
- What'd he do to you?

19:07.620 --> 19:09.787
- Take a 16 year old girl,

19:10.818 --> 19:13.603
screwed in the head, runs away from home,

19:13.603 --> 19:16.686
heads west until the ocean stops her.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.167
There on the beach she meets,

19:21.416 --> 19:24.833
can't say handsome but engaging stranger.

19:26.897 --> 19:29.316
He fills her ear with beautiful thoughts

19:29.316 --> 19:33.107
and promises she never thought possible,

19:33.107 --> 19:36.866
gets her to follow him
back to his compound,

19:36.866 --> 19:39.033
for lack of a better word,

19:40.085 --> 19:43.585
and there, she finds plenty of other naive

19:45.922 --> 19:47.422
like minded girls.

19:49.539 --> 19:52.706
It's basically his own personal harem.

19:53.667 --> 19:58.003
He spouts philosophical nonsense
and they can't get enough.

19:58.003 --> 19:59.411
- You good?

19:59.411 --> 20:00.661
- Borrow a pen.

20:06.960 --> 20:07.793
Go away.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.310
So our little runaway

20:15.891 --> 20:19.966
starts to see tears in
the fabric of his lies,

20:19.966 --> 20:23.084
and pushes, but he's got the others

20:23.084 --> 20:26.667
so wrapped up tight
that they keep her down

20:28.465 --> 20:30.109
and she realizes she can't get out

20:30.109 --> 20:31.776
not without trouble.

20:34.001 --> 20:37.418
So one night, when the others are asleep,

20:39.245 --> 20:40.995
she creeps downstairs

20:42.369 --> 20:45.702
and pulls the gas main out of the stove.

20:48.157 --> 20:49.574
It leaks a while,

20:50.734 --> 20:54.067
and then she lights a fire and it works.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.464
There are screams.

21:01.137 --> 21:02.594
Flames.

21:02.594 --> 21:03.511
People die.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.424
Some get away, maybe even him.

21:07.424 --> 21:10.788
She doesn't know, not for a long time,

21:10.788 --> 21:14.227
not until she finds
herself at a group meeting

21:14.227 --> 21:17.191
and hears the boy in front tell a story

21:17.191 --> 21:20.882
about her monster and then she knows,

21:20.882 --> 21:23.715
he got out and he's hurting again.

21:26.609 --> 21:30.418
And maybe, just maybe, she's met the one

21:30.418 --> 21:31.957
other person in the whole world who'd do

21:31.957 --> 21:35.074
anything to help her stop him.

21:35.074 --> 21:36.729
- It's a good story.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.725
Yeah, is it true?

21:38.725 --> 21:40.694
- That's on his wrist.

21:48.363 --> 21:50.270
- Who are you?

21:50.270 --> 21:51.738
- O.

21:51.738 --> 21:53.905
- Oh, like the expression?

21:54.778 --> 21:56.278
- Like the letter.

21:57.323 --> 21:59.005
Or the story.

21:59.005 --> 22:00.755
- What story?
- Of O.

22:01.961 --> 22:04.621
- Get out of here, it's...

22:04.621 --> 22:05.788
- You with me?

22:08.651 --> 22:10.401
- You know who he is?

22:11.546 --> 22:13.515
You know where to find him.

22:23.392 --> 22:24.225
- Maybe.

22:26.864 --> 22:28.049
- Why maybe?

22:28.049 --> 22:29.549
- Personal belief.

22:32.146 --> 22:34.396
Takes a killer to make one.

23:03.926 --> 23:06.342
You still live here, even after.

23:06.342 --> 23:08.757
- Yeah, I know, it's crazy, it's...

23:08.757 --> 23:11.783
- You don't have to explain yourself.

23:22.353 --> 23:25.091
You still keep all her things up, too.

23:28.353 --> 23:30.686
Just in case she comes back?

23:31.589 --> 23:32.422
- Yeah.

23:39.549 --> 23:40.382
Follow me.

24:05.391 --> 24:06.724
- There you are.

24:09.711 --> 24:12.286
Do you dream about it?

24:12.286 --> 24:14.531
- Sometimes.

24:15.633 --> 24:19.839
- What do you see when
you close your eyes?

24:19.839 --> 24:21.759
- Her.

24:21.759 --> 24:23.534
- Does she say anything?

24:25.496 --> 24:26.329
- Why?

24:29.864 --> 24:31.864
- Just curious.

24:31.864 --> 24:34.864
- That's what she says, why.

24:37.542 --> 24:40.125
And I never know how to answer.

24:52.318 --> 24:55.058
- Let's get one from him.

25:00.678 --> 25:01.860
- Sorry about this.

25:01.860 --> 25:03.441
What are y'all cops or something?

25:03.441 --> 25:04.448
- Something.

25:04.448 --> 25:06.369
- Just wanted to know if
you've seen or done this work.

25:06.369 --> 25:08.911
- Well, if y'all not cops,
I don't feel no civic

25:08.911 --> 25:12.578
obligation to comply
with your request, sir.

25:14.703 --> 25:16.927
- What am I, a stripper?

25:16.927 --> 25:18.960
No offense, Shaunae.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.815
Look, what did this guy do so bad

25:20.815 --> 25:25.136
that he got y'all ripping
around the city looking for him?

25:25.136 --> 25:26.545
- Let's go.

25:26.545 --> 25:27.378
- Wait.

25:32.033 --> 25:33.795
See the girl in this photo, big man?

25:33.795 --> 25:34.977
- Get to it, Snow White.

25:34.977 --> 25:36.786
- She means a lot to us.

25:36.786 --> 25:41.602
And this son of a bitch is
gonna hurt when we find him.

25:41.602 --> 25:42.996
- Based on account of what he did to her.

25:42.996 --> 25:45.346
- That's right.

25:45.346 --> 25:47.778
- Y'all are like some death wish shit?

25:47.778 --> 25:49.313
You got your man Dexter out here

25:49.313 --> 25:52.337
ready to go carve him
up on Room Street, boy.

25:52.337 --> 25:53.522
- Room Street.

25:53.522 --> 25:55.250
- Yeah, man, that one's free of charge.

25:55.250 --> 25:58.001
The ink right here is
definitely a Room Street boy.

25:58.001 --> 25:59.937
Most of them are gone,
with the gentrification

25:59.937 --> 26:00.996
and everything.

26:00.996 --> 26:02.097
- What about the ones that are left?

26:02.097 --> 26:03.425
- What about the ones that are left?

26:03.425 --> 26:04.593
Either they're in the county jail

26:04.593 --> 26:05.857
or they six feet deep.

26:05.857 --> 26:07.233
- And the ones that aren't?

26:07.233 --> 26:08.801
- The ones that aren't, you can catch 'em

26:08.801 --> 26:11.459
over at the loading dock
over off of central.

26:11.459 --> 26:14.098
That's where all the
ex-cons go to get work.

26:14.098 --> 26:18.194
That's all you're getting from me, okay?

26:18.194 --> 26:20.625
- Thanks for the info.

26:20.625 --> 26:22.001
- Fucking white people.

26:22.001 --> 26:23.425
Why are you guys like this?

26:23.425 --> 26:24.758
It's so cryptic.

26:25.617 --> 26:27.356
- There are easily a hundred guys

26:27.356 --> 26:28.700
that come through here a night.

26:28.700 --> 26:30.828
- We're only looking for the one.

26:30.828 --> 26:33.214
- Don't you think it's strange.

26:33.214 --> 26:35.310
That some gang banger is
the guy who attacked me

26:35.310 --> 26:38.143
and mind controlled you in a cult?

26:39.004 --> 26:40.828
- Yes, it's weird,

26:40.828 --> 26:44.124
but the world doesn't make sense.

26:44.124 --> 26:46.332
Women who are raped are more likely

26:46.332 --> 26:48.252
to have rape fantasies after.

26:48.252 --> 26:49.620
Does that make any sense?

26:49.620 --> 26:51.532
- Is that true?

26:51.532 --> 26:52.684
- How should I know?

26:52.684 --> 26:53.517
- Just...

26:56.220 --> 26:57.053
Why wait?

26:59.356 --> 27:00.668
- For what?

27:00.668 --> 27:01.669
- Till me.

27:01.669 --> 27:02.764
Why didn't you just go after him?

27:02.764 --> 27:04.668
You know who he was, you
know what he looked like.

27:04.668 --> 27:05.669
- I told you.

27:05.669 --> 27:07.756
I didn't know he was still
around till you shared.

27:07.756 --> 27:11.356
- Yeah, but when did you
try to attempt to from want?

27:11.356 --> 27:12.356
Is that him?

27:15.453 --> 27:17.052
You sure?

27:22.120 --> 27:23.703
Okay, so, now what?

27:24.936 --> 27:26.811
- We follow.

28:19.210 --> 28:20.877
- No, he can see us.

28:22.505 --> 28:24.122
This isn't gonna work, he can see us.

28:24.122 --> 28:27.018
Let's just get his license
plate and we'll go, okay?

28:27.018 --> 28:28.873
Does that sound good.

28:28.873 --> 28:29.706
O, O, O.

28:49.985 --> 28:53.235
- Hey, you looking for something?

28:55.601 --> 28:57.137
Hey did you hear me?

28:57.137 --> 28:59.720
- Oh, shit, shit, shit.

29:01.476 --> 29:03.045
- Help me lift him.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.795
- Is he dead?

29:06.741 --> 29:07.969
- No.

29:07.969 --> 29:08.802
Lift him.

29:09.825 --> 29:11.185
Scott.

29:18.922 --> 29:21.047
Take his car, follow me.

29:21.047 --> 29:22.312
- Where we going?

29:24.347 --> 29:25.180
Okay.

29:27.814 --> 29:28.917
Fuck.

29:50.332 --> 29:51.499
- Turn it off.

29:52.571 --> 29:54.748
Come on, bring him.

30:22.894 --> 30:24.305
Put him here.

30:30.291 --> 30:31.778
Wait.

30:52.517 --> 30:53.517
These go on,

30:56.519 --> 31:00.102
and in a few moments,
you're gonna use this

31:01.431 --> 31:02.681
to wake him up.

31:19.340 --> 31:20.590
- That's wrong.

31:24.892 --> 31:26.205
- What?

31:26.205 --> 31:27.660
- The knot that you're trying.

31:27.660 --> 31:29.660
The double ends so that
they can be crossed

31:29.660 --> 31:30.743
and released.

31:37.392 --> 31:40.809
- Soon as he wakes, you're gonna use this

31:41.728 --> 31:43.311
to get him talking.

31:44.975 --> 31:46.897
Cut him if you have to.

31:46.897 --> 31:50.230
- Thought of everything, you were ready.

31:54.088 --> 31:56.920
- When he comes to, don't mention me,

31:56.920 --> 31:58.265
don't let him see me.

31:58.265 --> 32:01.772
You can talk to me but don't
let him know who it is.

32:01.772 --> 32:02.605
- Why not?

32:05.447 --> 32:07.753
- I want him to be yours first.

32:07.753 --> 32:09.928
- I don't even know what I'm doing here.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.761
- Making things right.

32:15.723 --> 32:18.049
- Why don't you want him to see you?

32:18.049 --> 32:20.861
What if somebody hears us
and they come to check on us?

32:20.861 --> 32:23.387
- Then I'll take care of 'em.

32:23.387 --> 32:24.220
Go.

32:35.639 --> 32:36.472
Scott.

32:37.625 --> 32:38.458
Gloves.

32:39.334 --> 32:40.167
- Right.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.150
- You have to break it first.

33:09.275 --> 33:10.608
- What the hell?

33:11.740 --> 33:12.907
What was that?

33:15.180 --> 33:17.078
What the fuck?

33:17.078 --> 33:19.774
What the fuck, I'll kill you.

33:19.774 --> 33:21.691
Where am I, where am I?

33:24.398 --> 33:26.013
- I think you hurt me.

33:26.013 --> 33:27.118
- You think?

33:27.118 --> 33:29.534
Man, who the fuck are you and where am I?

33:34.642 --> 33:35.886
Hello.

33:39.660 --> 33:43.827
- Two months ago, a home
invasion, a guy and a girl.

33:45.517 --> 33:47.166
- No, no, no, wait, wait, wait,

33:47.166 --> 33:48.446
who were talking to over there?

33:48.446 --> 33:49.852
- The guy lived, the girl didn't.

33:49.852 --> 33:50.978
- Are we alone?

33:50.978 --> 33:52.766
Is there somebody else here?

33:52.766 --> 33:54.190
- You gave me a choice.

33:54.190 --> 33:56.381
- No, is
someone making you do this?

33:56.381 --> 33:57.949
- Do you remember?

33:57.949 --> 33:59.869
- You're afraid.

33:59.869 --> 34:02.350
I see it in your pussy face.

34:02.350 --> 34:04.974
- Do it again, you'll lose an eye.

34:05.984 --> 34:09.150
You gave me a choice, my life or hers.

34:10.158 --> 34:12.062
Do you remember?

34:12.062 --> 34:14.812
- I've never seen you before man.

34:16.606 --> 34:17.964
- This.

34:17.964 --> 34:18.965
- What about it?

34:18.965 --> 34:20.221
- I saw it that night.

34:20.221 --> 34:21.534
I saw you.

34:21.534 --> 34:22.534
- Did you?

34:22.534 --> 34:23.678
- Don't stop.

34:23.678 --> 34:26.062
- Who the fuck is that?

34:26.062 --> 34:28.784
Why don't you come out here, huh?

34:28.784 --> 34:31.953
Letting your woman tell you what to do?

34:31.953 --> 34:33.661
- It was you.

34:33.661 --> 34:35.453
- Well, I'm flattered
you think so, tough guy,

34:35.453 --> 34:37.293
but you got the wrong man.

34:37.293 --> 34:38.293
- We don't.

34:38.293 --> 34:39.692
- Shut up.

34:39.692 --> 34:41.422
Don't listen to her man.

34:41.422 --> 34:43.533
You've never seen me
before and you know this.

34:43.533 --> 34:44.813
You can't trust what she says

34:44.813 --> 34:47.260
or what you think you've seen in the dark.

34:47.260 --> 34:48.262
- Why is that?

34:48.262 --> 34:50.668
- Memories, you can't trust 'em.

34:50.668 --> 34:51.772
Shit changes.

34:51.772 --> 34:54.429
- The farther they get.

34:54.429 --> 34:57.165
You need something just a
little more tangible, huh?

34:57.165 --> 34:58.164
- Fuck.

34:58.164 --> 35:00.109
- Like a picture, huh?

35:00.109 --> 35:01.244
What do you think, huh?

35:01.244 --> 35:03.360
Do remember her by?

35:03.360 --> 35:04.846
Why, huh?

35:04.846 --> 35:05.966
Why'd you come for us?

35:05.966 --> 35:08.381
- She got to you too, huh?

35:08.381 --> 35:09.550
- Why, huh?

35:09.550 --> 35:11.132
- Look, she's coming up betrayal.

35:11.132 --> 35:12.428
- Why did you put this on me, huh?

35:12.428 --> 35:13.469
- It doesn't end this way.

35:13.469 --> 35:14.961
- Why did you make me choose, huh?

35:14.961 --> 35:16.414
Why the fuck am I alive?

35:16.414 --> 35:18.045
- Ophelia.

35:18.045 --> 35:19.150
- No!

35:19.150 --> 35:20.494
Don't call me that.

35:20.494 --> 35:21.761
- I knew it was you.

35:21.761 --> 35:24.172
- You never get to call me that again.

35:24.172 --> 35:25.709
- Can't get your hands dirty yourself.

35:25.709 --> 35:27.037
- Do it, Scott.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.172
- First time, Scotty.

35:28.172 --> 35:29.174
- Do it.

35:29.174 --> 35:30.413
- Yeah, do it.

35:30.413 --> 35:31.886
We all do it, just like she wants.

35:31.886 --> 35:33.309
- Do it.

36:01.427 --> 36:02.677
- Hey, asshole.

36:11.224 --> 36:12.874
It's housekeeping, I'm
here to make this place

36:12.874 --> 36:15.194
not smell like the living dead.

36:15.194 --> 36:17.402
Oh my god, you're here, I
never would have guessed.

36:17.402 --> 36:18.456
- Hey, Tim, hey--

36:18.456 --> 36:21.181
- No, no, I know, you don't
want anybody coming over.

36:21.181 --> 36:23.243
All right, you gotta cry in
your jersey self loathing,

36:23.243 --> 36:24.284
but look--
- Tim, no.

36:24.284 --> 36:25.354
- Tim, yes.
- No.

36:25.354 --> 36:26.810
- What we're gonna do is
we're gonna get you dressed.

36:26.810 --> 36:27.812
- No, I'm dressed.

36:27.812 --> 36:31.593
- We'll get out there and then we'll...

36:31.593 --> 36:32.970
Hello.

36:32.970 --> 36:34.317
- Hi.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.361
- Hi, I'm--
- Tim.

36:36.361 --> 36:37.594
- Oh, you've heard of me.

36:37.594 --> 36:39.242
- That's O.

36:39.242 --> 36:40.075
- O.

36:41.385 --> 36:42.810
- Yeah, from group.

36:42.810 --> 36:43.643
- Oh, O.

36:45.625 --> 36:46.809
You went, that's great.

36:46.809 --> 36:47.866
Okay.

36:47.866 --> 36:49.432
So this is...

36:49.432 --> 36:51.097
- Yeah, this is...

36:51.097 --> 36:51.930
- Great.

36:53.803 --> 36:54.636
- Yeah.

36:54.636 --> 36:55.469
- Yeah.

36:55.469 --> 36:57.288
- Yeah, so I'm actually...

36:57.288 --> 36:59.624
- You're going, he's going.

36:59.624 --> 37:01.291
- Going, yes, right,

37:02.519 --> 37:04.728
but it was lovely to meet you, O.

37:04.728 --> 37:06.311
Which is short for?

37:07.352 --> 37:08.920
- O.

37:12.456 --> 37:16.376
- K, well, hope to see
you again soon, I'm sure.

37:16.376 --> 37:18.010
- No, let's go.
- Yeah, yeah.

37:18.010 --> 37:19.835
- All right, I'm gonna call you.

37:19.835 --> 37:21.128
- She's cute, man, I'm so proud of you.

37:21.128 --> 37:22.218
- Thanks, okay, yeah.

37:22.218 --> 37:23.464
Okay, would you go?

37:23.464 --> 37:25.416
- Come on, dinner date,
man, the three of us, four,

37:25.416 --> 37:26.876
I'll find someone if I need to.

37:26.876 --> 37:27.992
- Yeah, I'm locking you out.

37:27.992 --> 37:32.121
- We should keep in
touch, I'm just saying.

37:32.121 --> 37:34.136
- Sorry about that.

37:34.136 --> 37:34.969
- Why?

37:36.472 --> 37:39.415
- He's pushy and obnoxious,

37:39.415 --> 37:42.744
and I don't really think he understands.

37:42.744 --> 37:44.920
- He's a well meaning fool.

37:44.920 --> 37:47.287
He wants to share your pain.

37:47.287 --> 37:50.120
- Yeah, it's not really that deep.

37:51.324 --> 37:53.223
He's my best friend.

37:53.223 --> 37:56.640
Actually, he's my only friend these days.

37:59.303 --> 38:01.208
- You resent him for it.

38:01.208 --> 38:02.716
- No.

38:02.716 --> 38:03.716
No, God, no.

38:05.944 --> 38:07.527
- That's important.

38:09.208 --> 38:11.041
Your conscience clear?

38:14.285 --> 38:15.118
- You?

38:16.440 --> 38:17.273
- Always.

38:19.141 --> 38:21.173
- We did the right thing.

38:21.173 --> 38:23.782
- We did the right thing.

38:23.782 --> 38:25.046
- So what do we do now?

38:25.046 --> 38:27.046
- No, Scott, this is it.

38:28.869 --> 38:31.141
We've done everything
we can for each other,

38:31.141 --> 38:33.077
now it's time we part
ways before we get too--

38:33.077 --> 38:34.295
- Are you kidding me?

38:34.295 --> 38:35.559
We don't do what we did--

38:35.559 --> 38:36.982
- What you did.
- And just walk away.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.541
- You found your peace.

38:39.541 --> 38:41.124
Let that be enough.

38:43.238 --> 38:46.342
Share it with someone
who doesn't have them.

38:46.342 --> 38:48.615
- 24 hours ago, I was
scared that I would never

38:48.615 --> 38:50.365
ever belong anywhere.

38:52.550 --> 38:55.397
Never be able to connect
with anyone again,

38:55.397 --> 38:57.980
and please, don't cheapen this.

39:02.856 --> 39:03.689
- Never.

39:26.919 --> 39:30.103
I have my own leads to follow.

39:32.601 --> 39:34.137
- With what?

39:34.137 --> 39:35.836
Let me help.

39:35.836 --> 39:37.479
Two seconds ago, you said that everybody

39:37.479 --> 39:39.689
needs to find their peace,
let me help you find yours.

39:39.689 --> 39:41.189
Whatever it takes.

39:43.015 --> 39:45.017
- You're saying you'd do it again?

39:51.606 --> 39:52.982
- Here.

39:52.982 --> 39:54.938
If you ever need anything,

39:54.938 --> 39:57.241
if you ever need me.

40:04.183 --> 40:05.016
- If ever.

41:18.498 --> 41:19.581
- Babe, babe,

41:22.802 --> 41:24.052
where you been?

41:24.945 --> 41:25.778
Huh?

41:26.709 --> 41:28.098
What?

41:34.460 --> 41:35.960
- Find your peace.

41:51.971 --> 41:53.250
- I need you.

42:03.318 --> 42:04.320
- Is everything okay?

42:04.320 --> 42:05.395
- It will be.

42:05.395 --> 42:06.467
Just drive.

42:06.467 --> 42:08.634
- What about your other...

42:11.139 --> 42:12.771
- Everybody has parts of their lives

42:12.771 --> 42:15.011
they don't share.

42:15.011 --> 42:17.491
Are you here for me?

42:17.491 --> 42:18.324
- Yeah.

42:20.036 --> 42:21.119
- Then drive.

42:23.379 --> 42:24.212
- Done.

42:45.266 --> 42:46.466
You said we got him, him.

42:46.466 --> 42:47.299
- We did.

42:50.700 --> 42:52.200
But it's not over.

42:54.418 --> 42:57.412
Not until we get all of them.

42:57.412 --> 42:59.745
- But there aren't any more.

43:03.458 --> 43:05.458
- Of course there are.

43:05.458 --> 43:08.050
- No, but you said it was him.

43:08.050 --> 43:09.883
- I need you for this.

43:11.122 --> 43:12.194
Please don't--

43:12.194 --> 43:14.527
- How do you know it's them?

43:16.963 --> 43:17.796
- I know.

43:18.957 --> 43:21.422
- Yeah, O, that doesn't make sense.

43:21.422 --> 43:22.589
O, O, come on.

43:24.685 --> 43:25.933
O.

43:25.933 --> 43:26.850
O, come on.

43:29.117 --> 43:29.950
O.

43:34.441 --> 43:36.108
Come here a minute.

43:38.345 --> 43:39.178
- Hello?

43:41.020 --> 43:42.553
Yes?

43:42.553 --> 43:44.793
- Do you remember me?

43:44.793 --> 43:45.931
- No.

43:45.931 --> 43:48.137
- Do you remember what you did to me?

43:48.137 --> 43:49.138
- I, I--
- O, come on.

43:49.138 --> 43:50.345
- Louise.

43:50.345 --> 43:52.845
- Not like this, are you sure?

43:54.137 --> 43:54.970
- Yes?

43:57.449 --> 43:59.641
- What is this about?

44:01.033 --> 44:02.232
- You.

44:20.724 --> 44:22.164
- Who are you?

44:22.164 --> 44:24.414
- Stop it, stop it.

44:25.412 --> 44:26.413
You sure?

44:26.413 --> 44:27.246
- I am.

44:28.292 --> 44:29.125
Go check.

44:37.078 --> 44:38.661
- What do you want?

44:39.925 --> 44:41.425
- What's going on?

44:45.909 --> 44:46.742
- Shh.

44:48.101 --> 44:48.934
- Shh.

44:50.186 --> 44:51.769
It's gonna be okay.

45:22.988 --> 45:24.843
- Who are you?

45:24.843 --> 45:25.676
- Shut up.

45:27.196 --> 45:28.861
You remember me.

45:28.861 --> 45:30.331
- I don't, who are you?

45:30.331 --> 45:31.498
- Remember me.

45:32.571 --> 45:33.404
Who am I?

45:34.907 --> 45:36.156
- I don't know.

45:36.156 --> 45:37.403
- Yes, you do.

45:37.403 --> 45:38.831
Stop lying.

45:38.831 --> 45:41.100
- She doesn't know you,
you got the wrong person.

45:42.955 --> 45:43.955
- She knows.

45:47.933 --> 45:50.684
Might have tried to forget.

45:50.684 --> 45:53.184
Thought it was all behind you,

45:54.347 --> 45:57.820
but deep down you knew
this day was coming,

45:57.820 --> 45:59.739
that I'd be back.

46:05.324 --> 46:09.491
You should've finished me off
when I was just a little girl.

46:12.042 --> 46:13.709
When I was helpless.

46:15.259 --> 46:16.092
Confused.

46:18.796 --> 46:19.629
Your toy.

46:23.851 --> 46:25.934
Do you know what she did?

46:27.195 --> 46:28.197
- No.

46:28.197 --> 46:30.539
- What your parents did?

46:30.539 --> 46:32.716
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

46:32.716 --> 46:35.049
- They took a girl, a child,

46:38.619 --> 46:40.036
younger than you,

46:42.156 --> 46:45.755
and they locked her in a basement,

46:45.755 --> 46:48.542
and they did things to her,

46:48.542 --> 46:49.875
bad, bad things.

46:57.221 --> 46:59.138
They put things in her,

47:02.885 --> 47:05.718
and when she cried, they hurt her,

47:08.312 --> 47:11.729
until she couldn't feel the pain anymore,

47:13.093 --> 47:16.593
until she couldn't feel anything but hate,

47:18.312 --> 47:20.312
and spite and emptiness.

47:25.239 --> 47:27.739
- That's not what you told me.

47:31.016 --> 47:32.839
- Who's side are you on?

47:32.839 --> 47:35.017
- I'm on the right side.

47:35.017 --> 47:36.503
What about the group?

47:36.503 --> 47:38.263
The leader, the family?

47:38.263 --> 47:40.346
- They're all part of it.

47:41.928 --> 47:43.111
- How?

47:43.111 --> 47:45.111
How can any of them be a part of it

47:45.111 --> 47:48.055
if you were just a
little girl in the story.

47:48.055 --> 47:51.927
You can't even keep it straight
in your own fucking head.

47:51.927 --> 47:54.510
- Did they make you do it, too?

47:55.847 --> 47:57.347
Hurt little girls?

48:00.277 --> 48:01.194
Touch them?

48:03.415 --> 48:04.665
Put it in them?

48:10.103 --> 48:10.936
Huh?

48:12.598 --> 48:13.848
- Jesus Christ.

48:20.265 --> 48:21.098
- Jealous?

48:24.025 --> 48:25.740
Want your turn?

48:35.782 --> 48:36.615
Hurt me.

48:39.462 --> 48:40.885
Take me.

48:52.467 --> 48:54.227
- You fucking bitch.

48:59.452 --> 49:00.869
- Save me, Scott.

50:30.292 --> 50:33.365
- This is where you lose me.

52:35.882 --> 52:36.715
- Oh.

52:40.202 --> 52:41.285
Scott, right?

52:43.307 --> 52:45.786
I didn't know if you'd be back.

52:45.786 --> 52:48.954
Just a little early for meeting, though.

52:48.954 --> 52:53.530
I'm glad you're here but
really early for meeting.

52:53.530 --> 52:55.947
- Did you know her real name?

52:55.947 --> 52:57.083
- Sorry?

52:57.083 --> 52:59.755
- O, what's her real name?

52:59.755 --> 53:01.290
- Don't know who you're referring to.

53:01.290 --> 53:03.949
- Dark haired girl, she left
with me the other night.

53:03.949 --> 53:06.666
- If something transpired between you two,

53:06.666 --> 53:07.834
that's your business.

53:07.834 --> 53:09.402
This is simply a support group.

53:09.402 --> 53:11.563
- How many before me?

53:11.563 --> 53:12.980
Are you in on it?

53:14.106 --> 53:15.706
- In on what?

53:15.706 --> 53:17.456
- How many before me?

53:18.875 --> 53:20.138
- Look, if you wanna just take a seat,

53:20.138 --> 53:23.178
we can discuss this when the
rest of the group gets here.

53:23.178 --> 53:26.587
- I don't need any goddamn therapy.

53:26.587 --> 53:28.827
I need to know who she is,

53:28.827 --> 53:30.781
and where I can find her.

53:30.781 --> 53:33.698
- Take your hands off of me, Scott.

53:41.503 --> 53:44.175
- Do you know who she is?

53:44.175 --> 53:47.599
Do you know where I can find her?

53:47.599 --> 53:50.334
- I'm not going to do that.

53:50.334 --> 53:51.334
- Goddammit.

53:52.943 --> 53:55.491
Do you know what she is?

53:55.491 --> 53:57.392
- She's a survivor, just
like the rest of us.

53:57.392 --> 53:58.975
- No.

53:58.975 --> 54:01.007
She's a predator.

54:01.007 --> 54:02.897
A manipulator.

54:02.897 --> 54:04.564
- You're projecting.

54:06.227 --> 54:08.975
- How many more people before me?

54:08.975 --> 54:12.058
How many people did she get close to?

54:13.215 --> 54:15.826
- This obsession that you
have with her is unhealthy.

54:15.826 --> 54:19.071
- Goddammit, give me some answers.

54:19.071 --> 54:22.079
- It's not uncommon for those
with a shared experience

54:22.079 --> 54:23.631
to create a bond or connection.

54:23.631 --> 54:24.464
- Who?

54:25.535 --> 54:26.702
Don't make me.

54:29.346 --> 54:32.096
- I'm not making you do anything.

54:51.148 --> 54:53.648
Fuck, man, get off your phone.

55:14.545 --> 55:15.938
Hello.

55:15.938 --> 55:17.330
- Yeah?

55:17.330 --> 55:18.163
- Hey.

55:19.377 --> 55:21.521
- Who's this?

55:21.521 --> 55:22.354
- Tim.

55:23.825 --> 55:26.193
I'm a friend of O's.

55:26.193 --> 55:27.204
- Who?

55:27.204 --> 55:28.205
- Tim.

55:28.205 --> 55:30.354
- No, no, no, who
are you looking for?

55:30.354 --> 55:31.187
- O.

55:32.530 --> 55:33.532
- Wrong number.

55:33.532 --> 55:35.185
- No, I know she stays here.

55:35.185 --> 55:36.352
Is she around?

55:39.590 --> 55:40.423
Hello?

55:42.674 --> 55:44.841
- Dial 252, come up.

55:58.308 --> 55:59.141
- Hello?

56:02.596 --> 56:03.429
- Hi.

56:09.236 --> 56:12.319
So are you the one she's been seeing?

56:13.685 --> 56:14.518
- I guess.

56:16.836 --> 56:18.753
- Do you know who I am?

56:19.687 --> 56:20.604
- She here?

56:21.556 --> 56:23.157
Do you know how to get a hold of her?

56:23.157 --> 56:24.660
- Drink.

56:24.660 --> 56:26.487
- No.

56:26.487 --> 56:29.288
Look, I know that this is strange, but I--

56:29.288 --> 56:31.299
- What did you say your name was?

56:31.299 --> 56:32.466
- Tim.

56:34.211 --> 56:35.044
- Okay.

56:37.412 --> 56:38.245
Tim.

56:42.213 --> 56:43.046
Greg.

56:44.644 --> 56:46.758
So what'd she tell you about me?

56:46.758 --> 56:48.758
- Didn't really come up.

56:50.325 --> 56:51.908
- Too busy fucking?

56:53.960 --> 56:58.391
- Look, Greg, I don't know
what kind of guy you are.

56:58.391 --> 56:59.636
I don't know if you're the jealous type.

56:59.636 --> 57:01.628
I don't know if you're her brother.

57:01.628 --> 57:02.760
I don't really know much of anything

57:02.760 --> 57:05.462
but I do know that she is gone

57:05.462 --> 57:07.962
and I don't know where she is,

57:07.962 --> 57:09.540
and maybe that is on purpose

57:09.540 --> 57:11.363
or maybe it's because she's scared,

57:11.363 --> 57:15.331
but I'm hoping that you're gonna be able

57:15.331 --> 57:16.916
to shed a little insight
as to what the fuck's

57:16.916 --> 57:18.083
going on here.

57:19.044 --> 57:21.157
- What did you two get up to?

57:21.157 --> 57:21.990
- Therapy.

57:23.844 --> 57:25.432
- Cute.

57:25.432 --> 57:27.684
She give you the song and dance?

57:27.684 --> 57:29.412
- You tell me.

57:29.412 --> 57:31.812
- Well, which one was
it, was it the dad one

57:31.812 --> 57:35.076
or the European vacation
kidnapping brothel?

57:35.076 --> 57:37.743
'Cause that one, I really liked.

57:38.580 --> 57:40.913
She's got some new material.

57:41.940 --> 57:43.539
- How long have you known her for?

57:43.539 --> 57:45.012
- Long enough, you?

57:45.012 --> 57:46.014
- Two days.

57:49.173 --> 57:50.006
- Wow.

57:51.620 --> 57:53.780
Now that is adorable,

57:53.780 --> 57:57.076
and here you come, swoop in and save her.

57:57.076 --> 58:00.493
Knight in shining and fucking armor, huh?

58:03.461 --> 58:04.692
Let her go.

58:04.692 --> 58:05.923
- Wish I could.

58:05.923 --> 58:08.590
- She's got you in too far, huh?

58:10.311 --> 58:12.311
- You've done it before.

58:14.611 --> 58:16.028
- Done what, Tim?

58:16.867 --> 58:18.226
- Have there been others?

58:18.226 --> 58:19.362
There are others.

58:19.362 --> 58:20.695
- Always others.

58:21.811 --> 58:24.435
- Then why do you keep staying with her?

58:24.435 --> 58:26.518
- That's a good question.

58:29.193 --> 58:31.943
You know, I try to be a good guy,

58:34.803 --> 58:36.947
but she just makes it so damn hard.

59:28.356 --> 59:29.189
Huh?

59:37.432 --> 59:38.664
Oh, no.

59:38.664 --> 59:39.914
Not yet, buddy.

59:47.498 --> 59:48.415
That a boy.

59:57.848 --> 01:00:00.425
- Your father was right about me.

01:00:00.425 --> 01:00:02.506
- Uh oh, what did he say?

01:00:02.506 --> 01:00:05.589
- Nothing, he fucking said...

01:00:07.273 --> 01:00:09.440
- What, what's the matter?

01:00:11.322 --> 01:00:12.155
- Nothing.

01:00:13.288 --> 01:00:14.705
- Where were you?

01:00:15.615 --> 01:00:16.865
- I don't know,

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:21.656
but I miss you.

01:00:21.656 --> 01:00:23.739
- I missed you too, baby.

01:00:24.904 --> 01:00:27.226
- It has been a crazy couple days.

01:00:27.226 --> 01:00:28.226
- It's okay.

01:00:30.906 --> 01:00:32.739
You're home, I'm here.

01:00:33.656 --> 01:00:34.489
- Yeah.

01:00:35.801 --> 01:00:37.801
- You've got red on you.

01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:41.422
Is that lipstick?

01:00:41.422 --> 01:00:42.424
- I don't think so.

01:00:42.424 --> 01:00:44.409
- You don't think, what the hell?

01:00:44.409 --> 01:00:47.865
- No, okay, I don't know what I've done.

01:00:47.865 --> 01:00:49.532
Would you just stop asking?

01:00:49.532 --> 01:00:51.496
- Don't you dare pull that shit with me.

01:00:51.496 --> 01:00:53.289
- I'm not pulling any shit.

01:00:53.289 --> 01:00:54.314
I'm just having a real hard time

01:00:54.314 --> 01:00:56.138
trying to keep things straight.

01:00:57.561 --> 01:00:58.563
- Who the hell is that?

01:00:58.563 --> 01:00:59.563
- Don't, don't.

01:00:59.563 --> 01:01:00.665
Don't get it.

01:01:00.665 --> 01:01:01.756
- What, why?

01:01:01.756 --> 01:01:02.589
- No, don't.

01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:04.231
Don't.

01:01:09.787 --> 01:01:12.328
- Get down.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.337
What's your name?

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.177
- You were there.

01:01:24.016 --> 01:01:25.840
- Scott.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.340
- I don't normally like to work from home.

01:01:35.187 --> 01:01:36.104
That a boy.

01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:40.674
You died there for a second.

01:01:40.674 --> 01:01:42.674
I had to bring you back.

01:01:43.651 --> 01:01:47.059
Guess that makes me your god, huh?

01:01:47.059 --> 01:01:49.859
How do you feel about that?

01:01:49.859 --> 01:01:50.692
Huh?

01:01:52.754 --> 01:01:54.278
What, huh?

01:01:54.278 --> 01:01:56.528
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

01:01:57.844 --> 01:02:00.915
- Why don't you just let me die?

01:02:00.915 --> 01:02:04.067
- Gotta do it on my own terms.

01:02:04.067 --> 01:02:06.178
God complex, she calls it.

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:11.560
Who the fuck is she to judge?

01:02:14.595 --> 01:02:17.634
Did she send you or did
you come on your own?

01:02:17.634 --> 01:02:19.923
- No, we're both looking for her.

01:02:19.923 --> 01:02:21.603
- I'm not looking for her.

01:02:21.603 --> 01:02:23.907
I asked you a question.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:26.679
Did she send you or did
you come on your own?

01:02:26.679 --> 01:02:28.012
- I'm on my own.

01:02:29.075 --> 01:02:29.908
- Good.

01:02:30.755 --> 01:02:33.554
- Yes, what now, huh, we
just sit here and wait?

01:02:33.554 --> 01:02:35.637
- For Mommy to come home?

01:02:40.151 --> 01:02:42.322
Do you remember meeting me?

01:02:42.322 --> 01:02:45.739
I don't mean just now but the first time?

01:02:46.803 --> 01:02:50.970
Or the last time, whichever
way you wanna think of it.

01:02:53.284 --> 01:02:54.690
No.

01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:55.523
Hmm.

01:02:57.404 --> 01:03:00.071
Maybe this will jog your memory.

01:03:07.686 --> 01:03:10.930
Think this will be a good one.

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:15.274
How 'bout this?

01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:18.898
Oh, you like that, huh?

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:22.397
Wow.

01:03:23.291 --> 01:03:27.341
That is a really spooky
look you're giving me.

01:03:27.341 --> 01:03:28.342
You know, to be honest with you,

01:03:28.342 --> 01:03:31.725
I didn't think that she was
gonna saddle up with you.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:33.121
Thought it was gonna
be like a one and done

01:03:33.121 --> 01:03:35.621
thing to exorcize your demons.

01:03:37.455 --> 01:03:38.955
Guess I was wrong.

01:03:41.373 --> 01:03:42.374
It happens.

01:03:42.374 --> 01:03:43.405
- I'm gonna kill you.

01:03:44.845 --> 01:03:46.349
- Well that didn't really work out for you

01:03:46.349 --> 01:03:47.920
five minutes ago, did it?

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.109
- You blinded me,
you like to fight dirty.

01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:51.709
Only way you're gonna win.

01:03:51.709 --> 01:03:53.372
- I won just fine.

01:03:53.372 --> 01:03:55.535
- Why don't you take off
these restraints and prove it?

01:03:55.535 --> 01:03:57.675
- You've really changed since last time.

01:03:57.675 --> 01:03:59.791
- Yeah, well she's
got that effect on people,

01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:04.415
but I'm guessing that you've
always been like this.

01:04:04.415 --> 01:04:06.843
- She does have a way of
bringing out the worst in people,

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.410
doesn't she?

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:10.570
- You're not like her.

01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:11.570
- No.

01:04:13.306 --> 01:04:14.223
No, no, no.

01:04:15.065 --> 01:04:19.066
- Don't you have
some stuff in common?

01:04:19.066 --> 01:04:20.566
- Yeah, like what?

01:04:21.467 --> 01:04:22.842
- You both tie rope the same.

01:04:36.064 --> 01:04:36.897
You lose.

01:04:37.793 --> 01:04:40.790
Now all we gotta do is
wait for her to come back.

01:04:45.985 --> 01:04:49.068
- She's not coming back, so you lose.

01:04:50.609 --> 01:04:54.442
You might as well finish
me you piece of shit.

01:04:57.073 --> 01:04:59.297
- Gladly.

01:05:33.587 --> 01:05:35.383
- He kept hitting me.

01:05:35.383 --> 01:05:36.387
- You coming to join us?

01:05:36.387 --> 01:05:37.304
I know you.

01:05:38.164 --> 01:05:39.347
- No.

01:05:39.347 --> 01:05:40.468
I'm looking for someone.

01:05:40.468 --> 01:05:42.724
Girl, dark hair, kind of standoffish.

01:05:42.724 --> 01:05:44.132
- That's most of us here.

01:05:44.132 --> 01:05:46.052
- Yeah, she's different.

01:05:46.052 --> 01:05:48.163
- Wait, no, no, no, wait,

01:05:48.163 --> 01:05:49.620
I do know you, though.

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.352
Right, I've seen your face or something.

01:05:51.352 --> 01:05:52.355
- Maybe.
- How?

01:05:52.355 --> 01:05:53.957
- Killed some people.

01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:42.192
- Scott, hey.

01:06:45.013 --> 01:06:45.846
Hey.

01:06:48.727 --> 01:06:50.695
You didn't bring me here for the cuisine,

01:06:50.695 --> 01:06:53.612
so are you gonna start or should I?

01:06:55.317 --> 01:06:56.614
- I'm in trouble.

01:06:56.614 --> 01:06:58.614
- No shit, what?

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:01.046
- Can I get you boys anything?

01:07:01.046 --> 01:07:02.822
- The chef special.

01:07:02.822 --> 01:07:05.526
- Whatever's about to expire.

01:07:05.526 --> 01:07:06.693
- Coffee then.

01:07:07.798 --> 01:07:08.631
- You?

01:07:09.846 --> 01:07:12.074
Hey, weren't you in here the other night?

01:07:12.074 --> 01:07:13.074
- No.

01:07:13.074 --> 01:07:14.075
- With that rude girl.

01:07:14.075 --> 01:07:16.408
- I'll have a coffee please.

01:07:18.304 --> 01:07:19.622
- 101 north, southbound.

01:07:19.622 --> 01:07:23.789
- Well, man, you look like
a junkie in need of a fix.

01:07:25.024 --> 01:07:28.001
- Did you hear anything about me?

01:07:28.001 --> 01:07:29.638
- In what sense?

01:07:29.638 --> 01:07:31.329
You call me up from a fucking payphone,

01:07:31.329 --> 01:07:33.312
which I didn't even know that
those things still existed,

01:07:33.312 --> 01:07:36.911
and now we are in possibly
the most questionable

01:07:36.911 --> 01:07:40.624
diner experience downtown has to offer.

01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:42.770
So I'm left to my own
devices, unless you'd like

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:44.353
to clue me in here.

01:07:47.311 --> 01:07:48.815
- I did some really bad shit.

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:50.398
- Stop being vague.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:55.527
- She made me do stuff,
man, she's fucking crazy.

01:07:56.849 --> 01:07:58.339
- We're talking about O?

01:07:58.339 --> 01:07:59.375
- Man, she says things.

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:01.520
She told me all this shit
that happened to her, okay,

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.372
or stuff that she says that
happened to her, right,

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:05.955
and I believed her,

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:09.909
and none of its true.

01:08:09.909 --> 01:08:14.623
- Well, then, what the
fuck happened to her, then?

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:15.985
- No, she hurts people.

01:08:15.985 --> 01:08:17.984
She makes shit up,

01:08:17.984 --> 01:08:20.287
and she just fucking justifies it.

01:08:20.287 --> 01:08:22.308
- What the fuck
happened to her, then?

01:08:22.308 --> 01:08:23.908
- I don't know.

01:08:23.908 --> 01:08:25.279
She's just gone.

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:29.876
- The murder
weapon is yet to be found.

01:08:29.876 --> 01:08:31.983
- Did you do something to O?

01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:34.000
- I didn't do anything to her.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.832
Okay, she was involved
in what happened to me.

01:08:41.316 --> 01:08:42.316
She could be fucking walking
around the corner in there,

01:08:42.316 --> 01:08:44.519
I'm gonna get fucking knocked
out by two life for 'em

01:08:44.519 --> 01:08:45.778
and end up in some warehouse

01:08:45.778 --> 01:08:47.761
with some new protege standing over me--

01:08:47.761 --> 01:08:48.946
- Scott, what in the
fucking ever loving hell

01:08:48.946 --> 01:08:50.100
are you talking about?

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:51.185
- Tim, I don't even know her name.

01:08:51.185 --> 01:08:53.714
I just have a fucking letter.

01:08:53.714 --> 01:08:56.850
I can't go to the cops
because I'm in, I'm in,

01:08:56.850 --> 01:08:59.031
and that's what she wanted.

01:08:59.031 --> 01:09:00.482
She wants to turn everybody into exactly

01:09:00.482 --> 01:09:02.353
what she wants them to be.

01:09:02.353 --> 01:09:05.649
- Stop with the fucking metaphors.

01:09:05.649 --> 01:09:08.562
Tell me what you did
that was so goddamn awful

01:09:08.562 --> 01:09:09.969
or I'm walking out of here, man.

01:09:09.969 --> 01:09:10.970
- I'm telling you.

01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:11.970
- Then say it.

01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:13.397
- Why, why?

01:09:13.397 --> 01:09:14.229
- Because.

01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:21.011
Because I want to hear it from you.

01:09:22.582 --> 01:09:24.212
Scott, Scott, let's keep talking.

01:09:24.212 --> 01:09:25.765
- Hey, what are you doing?

01:09:25.765 --> 01:09:27.444
- 33 year old
Scott Smith of Echo Park.

01:09:27.444 --> 01:09:28.742
- Scott, just sit down and keep talking.

01:09:28.742 --> 01:09:29.765
- Smith is
wanted in connection

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:30.765
with the attack--

01:09:30.765 --> 01:09:31.768
- Come on, man.

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:32.769
- You know where she is?

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:33.770
- Look--

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:34.770
- You fucking liar, you son of a bitch.

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:38.067
- Scott, just calm the fuck down, man.

01:09:38.067 --> 01:09:41.238
Scott, calm the fuck down, man.

01:09:41.238 --> 01:09:42.812
Let go of me.

01:09:42.812 --> 01:09:45.627
You're acting like a groovy shit.

01:09:45.627 --> 01:09:46.764
Fuck.

01:09:46.764 --> 01:09:48.180
- I'm not afraid.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:50.519
- Jeez, fuck.

01:09:53.627 --> 01:09:55.195
Scott this is ridiculous.

01:09:55.195 --> 01:09:57.291
- Shut up, Tim, just shut up.

01:09:57.291 --> 01:10:00.482
- Look, let's just go to the cops.

01:10:00.482 --> 01:10:01.771
- What's the point?

01:10:01.771 --> 01:10:04.188
So I can suffer for her sins?

01:10:05.051 --> 01:10:06.051
It's not me.

01:10:07.083 --> 01:10:09.117
- None of this is you.

01:10:09.117 --> 01:10:10.880
You haven't been you
in months, not since...

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.332
- Yeah, not since it all happened.

01:10:12.332 --> 01:10:14.156
You should have just let me be.

01:10:14.156 --> 01:10:16.923
You could have died quietly and alone,

01:10:16.923 --> 01:10:18.622
then we wouldn't be here now would we?

01:10:18.622 --> 01:10:20.683
- Don't do that.

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.686
- Do what?

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:24.300
- Cheapen everything.

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.986
- Oh, that's all memories are anymore.

01:10:25.986 --> 01:10:26.819
Cheap.

01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:42.412
- Hey, ,

01:10:42.412 --> 01:10:44.329
but she's not here man.

01:10:46.521 --> 01:10:48.955
- Where is she?

01:10:48.955 --> 01:10:51.232
- Scott, look, I told you,

01:10:51.232 --> 01:10:53.073
I don't know, man, I haven't seen her.

01:10:54.752 --> 01:10:57.920
Jesus, what the hell is wrong with you?

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.919
- I'll pop you again,

01:10:58.919 --> 01:10:59.930
where the hell is she?

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:00.847
- Not here.

01:11:02.046 --> 01:11:04.592
- She lies, Tim.

01:11:04.592 --> 01:11:06.610
I told you that.

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.512
- Yeah, you said a lot of shit.

01:11:08.512 --> 01:11:11.247
- Yeah and it was all true,

01:11:11.247 --> 01:11:15.042
except the part about you being my friend.

01:11:15.042 --> 01:11:16.676
- I am.

01:11:16.676 --> 01:11:18.224
I'm the only one you've got.

01:11:18.224 --> 01:11:19.951
- Then listen to me.

01:11:19.951 --> 01:11:21.504
Because everything that has happened,

01:11:21.504 --> 01:11:24.180
everything that has happened to me,

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.180
what I did, it's all because of her.

01:11:29.103 --> 01:11:30.960
- Well, then, turn yourself in, man.

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.543
Bring her down too.

01:11:34.096 --> 01:11:36.224
- There's no point.

01:11:36.224 --> 01:11:39.937
It's her or me, one of us is gonna die,

01:11:39.937 --> 01:11:41.770
right here, right now.

01:11:43.424 --> 01:11:45.023
- Completely lost your mind.

01:11:45.023 --> 01:11:45.856
- No, no.

01:11:48.368 --> 01:11:49.785
I found my peace.

01:11:51.872 --> 01:11:54.039
In the worst possible way.

01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:01.050
- Scott, please, man, just sit down.

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:04.785
Okay?

01:12:08.576 --> 01:12:09.951
Son of a bitch.

01:12:14.944 --> 01:12:16.722
You really should have believed me, Tim.

01:12:16.722 --> 01:12:18.389
I'm not the bad guy.

01:12:19.408 --> 01:12:23.575
Even though she would love
it if I was, wouldn't you?

01:12:27.659 --> 01:12:29.576
- Don't do this, Scott.

01:12:30.634 --> 01:12:31.467
- Do what?

01:12:32.874 --> 01:12:34.427
Huh?

01:12:34.427 --> 01:12:35.756
- Don't do this.

01:12:35.756 --> 01:12:36.589
- Do what?

01:12:38.944 --> 01:12:42.111
Make you choose the way that I had to?

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:45.215
What about him?

01:12:45.215 --> 01:12:46.706
What about him, huh?

01:12:46.706 --> 01:12:49.120
Should we make him choose?

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.423
What do you think, Tim?

01:12:51.423 --> 01:12:54.340
You wanna know what I went through?

01:12:55.999 --> 01:12:56.832
Okay.

01:12:58.255 --> 01:12:59.943
Let's play.

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:00.776
Let's...

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:07.547
Everybody gets to be what they never were,

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.317
so me, I'm the monster.

01:13:12.928 --> 01:13:15.011
And you, you're the fool.

01:13:20.627 --> 01:13:22.294
And you, the victim.

01:13:29.262 --> 01:13:30.878
It's gonna be fun.

01:13:39.672 --> 01:13:43.172
You never have really been here, have you?

01:13:46.405 --> 01:13:48.723
Always just telling stories, right?

01:13:48.723 --> 01:13:51.973
Just stealing other people's tragedies,

01:13:53.556 --> 01:13:56.389
but you never had one of your own.

01:13:59.061 --> 01:14:03.061
You know, maybe that is
your greatest suffering,

01:14:04.611 --> 01:14:08.028
and maybe I can help you with that, yeah?

01:14:10.213 --> 01:14:13.157
Okay, what do you say, huh?

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:14.259
Should I slit her throat?

01:14:14.259 --> 01:14:17.012
- Please, please, Scott, don't do this.

01:14:17.012 --> 01:14:18.014
- But why?

01:14:18.014 --> 01:14:19.715
She was gonna do it to you.

01:14:19.715 --> 01:14:20.548
She was.

01:14:21.748 --> 01:14:24.515
She just wanted me to see.

01:14:24.515 --> 01:14:27.893
You didn't know what I was capable of.

01:14:27.893 --> 01:14:30.643
You didn't know what you made me.

01:14:34.198 --> 01:14:37.019
- I didn't make you anything.

01:14:39.819 --> 01:14:42.106
- You didn't put the blade in my hand?

01:14:42.106 --> 01:14:44.570
You didn't push me to the edge?

01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:46.475
You didn't catch me on a downturn

01:14:46.475 --> 01:14:50.748
and just play me like
you did everybody else.

01:14:50.748 --> 01:14:55.195
Okay, one question, how
long would I have had?

01:15:00.609 --> 01:15:01.947
Hmm?

01:15:01.947 --> 01:15:02.780
- Please.

01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:05.843
Scott.

01:15:14.361 --> 01:15:15.278
I'm scared.

01:15:16.193 --> 01:15:17.026
- Good.

01:15:18.894 --> 01:15:21.977
You actually look like a human being.

01:15:23.195 --> 01:15:27.362
All the suffering and
tragedy that you have caused.

01:15:31.775 --> 01:15:33.358
This is my justice.

01:15:37.696 --> 01:15:39.706
This is my revenge.

01:15:43.686 --> 01:15:44.519
Hey, O.

01:15:48.047 --> 01:15:48.880
Stay.

01:15:49.983 --> 01:15:51.183
Stay.

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:53.843
Don't worry, buddy.

01:15:53.843 --> 01:15:55.843
I'm just making a point.

01:15:58.479 --> 01:16:00.396
What do you think, Tim?

01:16:01.327 --> 01:16:04.910
If you had a choice,
would you die for her?

01:16:05.791 --> 01:16:06.880
Would you?

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.422
- I don't know.

01:16:09.422 --> 01:16:11.589
- It's not an answer, Tim.

01:16:12.814 --> 01:16:14.383
You need to make a choice
or you're gonna die,

01:16:14.383 --> 01:16:15.383
both of you.

01:16:15.383 --> 01:16:18.181
And I'm gonna be the one
who walks out of here,

01:16:18.181 --> 01:16:19.648
so why don't you make the choice

01:16:19.648 --> 01:16:21.731
that I never got to make?

01:16:23.422 --> 01:16:25.172
- You had the choice.

01:16:26.517 --> 01:16:28.655
- Oh, that's right.

01:16:28.655 --> 01:16:30.190
You were there.

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:31.986
What did I say?

01:16:31.986 --> 01:16:33.344
What did I do?

01:16:33.344 --> 01:16:35.087
Because the more that I think about it,

01:16:35.087 --> 01:16:38.087
the more that I just can't remember.

01:16:40.222 --> 01:16:43.472
All right, Tim, let's make that choice.

01:16:44.511 --> 01:16:46.594
All one, make the choice.

01:16:52.388 --> 01:16:53.391
- No.

01:16:53.391 --> 01:16:55.456
- Right answer.

01:17:10.551 --> 01:17:12.743
What's the matter?

01:17:12.743 --> 01:17:13.993
Beat you to it?

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.440
This is what you wanted.

01:17:20.311 --> 01:17:24.007
This is want you wanted me to become.

01:17:41.984 --> 01:17:45.151
This is how I want you to remember it.

01:17:49.784 --> 01:17:50.784
- Thank you.

01:17:56.298 --> 01:17:57.803
- Now run.

01:18:40.309 --> 01:18:42.226
Say it, say it, say it.

01:18:46.831 --> 01:18:48.164
Kill me, say it.

01:18:52.705 --> 01:18:53.538
Say it.

01:18:55.223 --> 01:18:56.515
Say it.

01:18:56.515 --> 01:18:57.348
Kill me.

01:18:58.497 --> 01:18:59.499
Kill me.

01:19:28.763 --> 01:19:31.100
- You all right, there?

01:19:38.123 --> 01:19:40.604
Ma'am, are you all right?

01:19:40.604 --> 01:19:41.437
- Perfect.

01:19:51.718 --> 01:19:55.083
It was someone I thought I could trust,

01:19:55.083 --> 01:19:58.166
share myself with and know in return.

01:20:02.491 --> 01:20:03.824
But I was wrong.

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:10.702
The real monsters are
the ones we don't see.

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:14.892
Standing right in front of us

01:20:16.507 --> 01:20:18.424
and then it's too late.

01:20:21.594 --> 01:20:24.844
I just keep seeing him reaching for me,

01:20:28.726 --> 01:20:31.809
trying to squeeze the life out of me,

01:20:33.238 --> 01:20:36.571
and I wonder who that person really was?

01:20:44.109 --> 01:20:44.942
- I know.

01:20:47.661 --> 01:20:51.161
It's hard to let anybody touch me anymore.

01:20:54.659 --> 01:20:55.908
Even a hand on the shoulder,

01:20:55.908 --> 01:20:57.636
trying to be supportive is a trigger.

01:20:57.636 --> 01:20:58.884
Just keeps bringing me back.

01:20:58.884 --> 01:21:00.584
I want to be okay with it,

01:21:00.584 --> 01:21:03.501
but people don't seem to understand

01:21:04.675 --> 01:21:06.931
and if I try to explain myself,

01:21:06.931 --> 01:21:11.076
I just come off as crazy, or I don't know.

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.307
- Not for you?

01:21:21.781 --> 01:21:24.003
- I don't think it's quite
for anyone, honestly.

01:21:24.003 --> 01:21:25.556
- How so?

01:21:25.556 --> 01:21:28.340
- Relies too much on the past.

01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:31.007
What happened, what we remember.

01:21:32.696 --> 01:21:35.507
Those things can change
however we want them.

01:21:43.602 --> 01:21:46.385
- So what do you hold on to?

01:21:46.385 --> 01:21:47.885
- What comes next.

01:21:49.394 --> 01:21:50.311
Going down?

01:21:51.968 --> 01:21:53.794
- I'll take another.

01:21:54.305 --> 01:22:00.483
