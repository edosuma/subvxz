WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.703
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.737 --> 00:06.674
(thinking)
 Nobody knows who I am.
 Not the real me.

00:06.705 --> 00:09.210
No one understands.

00:09.243 --> 00:11.644
No one has an older sister
 who's a Slayer.

00:11.679 --> 00:16.516
I know it's always
been this way.
She's the baby.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.853
But for some reason lately,
it's just really getting to me.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.256
Well, yeah.
You're like her idol, Buffy.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.591
What do you think
you're doing?

00:24.625 --> 00:26.094
Leave me alone.

00:26.126 --> 00:29.429
I will, after you come back
inside the house.
Let go of me!

00:29.463 --> 00:31.664
No, it's not safe
out here.
(gasps)

00:31.699 --> 00:32.865
(screams)

00:34.033 --> 00:35.603
Anya!

00:39.606 --> 00:41.942
This head wound looks bad.
I'm gonna get her
to a hospital.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.179
(TV: indistinct)

00:45.213 --> 00:46.947
I wish I had something
food-like to offer you guys,

00:47.046 --> 00:50.850
but the hot plate's
out of commission.
We think the cat peed on it.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.287
Aah! Oh!
XANDER: I do have SpaghettiOs.

00:54.322 --> 00:57.890
Set 'em on top of the dryer,
and you're a fluff cycle away
from lukewarm goodness.

00:57.924 --> 01:01.295
Yeah. I had dryer food
for lunch.

01:01.329 --> 01:04.563
(door slams)
Huh. Guess the folks
are back.

01:04.596 --> 01:07.234
(man, woman arguing)
(crashing)

01:07.268 --> 01:11.070
No, no. I was wrong.
Just incompetent burglars.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.974
MAN: Like-- Like I'm gonna
listen to your friends sober?

01:14.007 --> 01:16.409
WOMAN: You are such a pig!
(thudding)

01:16.444 --> 01:19.612
MAN: Oh, all right with me.
Yeah, that's great.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.382
Yeah, maybe it's definitely time
to start looking for
a new place.

01:22.415 --> 01:25.552
Something a little nicer.
Buffy, you've been to hell.

01:25.585 --> 01:26.853
They had one-bedrooms, right?

01:28.822 --> 01:32.793
Hey, Buffy,
how's that book? Full of
zippy dates and zesty names?

01:32.825 --> 01:34.295
I'm fine.

01:37.331 --> 01:41.769
-Hey! I'm enjoying
the studying.
-Who are you lately?

01:41.801 --> 01:43.637
Give it up
and watch the movie.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.774
I guess it has been
a long day with the crusades.

01:46.807 --> 01:50.009
I could take a little break
from the violence for some--
oh, fighting.

01:53.347 --> 01:56.849
If you really want,
we can fight you as well.

01:56.884 --> 02:00.921
Incompetently dubbed kung fu.
Our most valuable
Chinese import.

02:00.953 --> 02:02.489
Much more durable
than their hot plates.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.426
Here.

02:05.459 --> 02:09.096
Just relax.
Mm.

02:09.127 --> 02:13.133
Mm, that feels good.

02:13.167 --> 02:17.704
(cracks knuckles)
Ow!

02:17.737 --> 02:21.775
What are you doing?
I have a dislocated shoulder.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.044
I'm trying to concentrate
on the kicking movie.

02:24.076 --> 02:26.646
Hey.
Rubbing went away.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.450
Oh. Sorry, I...
got caught up
in the action.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.353
Yeah.
It's pretty good.

02:34.687 --> 02:37.057
Oh, give me a break! Uh!

02:37.090 --> 02:39.492
This is all wrong.
See, first you would
get the big guy,

02:39.526 --> 02:42.462
like, a flying kick,
then you would take out
all the little ones-- bam, bam.

02:42.496 --> 02:47.668
See? Now with the flying kick.
From a dead stop. What's
powering it? Raw enthusiasm?

02:47.700 --> 02:50.337
Hey, Buff, maybe you
oughta leave the work
behind sometimes.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.372
You're not always
on Slayer duty, you know?

02:52.406 --> 02:56.009
It would drive you crazy
if we were watching
...an army movie,

02:56.043 --> 02:58.512
and they were all
saluting backwards

02:58.545 --> 03:01.048
and invading
all willy-nilly.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.650
WOMAN: Gonna run away, huh?

03:02.682 --> 03:05.218
Yeah, 'cause that's
what you do best!

03:05.252 --> 03:08.187
(coughing)

03:08.222 --> 03:12.425
Anyway, I mean, you know,
you can't blame me
for being critical.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.162
Willow's the same way
when we watch a movie
about witches, right, Xander?

03:15.194 --> 03:17.365
What?

03:17.397 --> 03:20.600
Oh, yeah. She's all,
like, "What's that?
A cauldron?

03:20.634 --> 03:22.635
Who uses a cauldron
anymore?"

03:26.038 --> 03:29.342
The last step
of my forging is my pain--

03:29.377 --> 03:31.611
the price with which
I purchase...

03:31.645 --> 03:33.813
the death of the Slayer.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.917
Aah!

03:40.753 --> 03:42.055
(theme music playing)

04:37.444 --> 04:39.747
If you get the apartment,
this'll be your hallway.

04:39.779 --> 04:43.483
We'll walk down this hall,
and we'll say, "La, la,
I'm on my way to Xander's."

04:43.516 --> 04:46.519
Just warning you, Xander.
I probably won't be doing that.
RILEY: Really? I will.

04:46.553 --> 04:50.457
Hey, we're just looking.
Rent's way high, so don't get
your hopes all carbonated.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.192
But you have references.

04:52.225 --> 04:55.194
No, I have Albert, which is me
doing an important voice.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.331
(clipped tones)
Xander Harris?
An excellent tenant,

04:57.365 --> 04:59.367
and a very
nice-looking fellow.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.170
Oh, big!

05:04.672 --> 05:07.675
BUFFY: It's nice.
And not subterranean.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.043
It's very
above-terranean.

05:10.076 --> 05:13.613
I want it. Pay anything.

05:13.646 --> 05:17.785
Xander Harris?
Uh, no. Riley Finn.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.052
This is Xander.

05:20.086 --> 05:22.322
Hey.
Ah.

05:22.355 --> 05:25.725
I brought my friends.
I see.

05:25.759 --> 05:30.329
They wouldn't always be around.
But we're clean and quiet.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.832
ANYA:
We can have the Scooby
meetings in the living room,

05:32.865 --> 05:35.502
and Giles can explain
the boring things over there.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.471
Oh! There's a microwave!

05:37.504 --> 05:40.540
It would be like having
hot and cold running popcorn.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.009
Phone and electricity
are hooked up.

05:43.043 --> 05:47.180
There's a private balcony,
ceiling fan, closet space,

05:47.213 --> 05:48.247
and that's the bedroom.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.286
Guys, you can't
save it for the bedroom?

05:56.223 --> 05:58.891
Okay. Good point.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.362
I brought an application
for you to fill out.

06:02.396 --> 06:07.567
An application?
I can't just...
tell you my references?

06:07.600 --> 06:10.771
Because there's Albert.
We run your credit check
based on the application.

06:10.803 --> 06:13.406
Oh! Credit check.

06:13.440 --> 06:18.778
Little check on the credit.
See how credible my checks are.
(all giggle)

06:18.812 --> 06:22.415
And we'll be asking for
first, last, security,
and a small cleaning deposit.

06:22.449 --> 06:26.519
The total's
at the bottom
of the sheet there.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.723
He'll take it.
Xander, go get the furniture.
I'll wait here.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.792
He's been living in his
drunken parents' basement,

06:31.824 --> 06:34.026
where something
urinated on the hot plate.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.062
Uh... Can we...

06:36.096 --> 06:38.031
talk quietly
over there?

06:38.064 --> 06:39.899
(whispers)
Excuse us.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.038
Uh, we, um--

06:46.072 --> 06:48.808
Uh, we like
the ceiling fan.
Yes.

06:48.841 --> 06:51.411
It's very, you know,
kind of "old south."

06:51.444 --> 06:54.581
But without
the unpleasant
slavery associations.

06:54.615 --> 06:57.750
But why can't we have it?
I told you.

06:57.784 --> 07:00.987
My construction job is ending,
and I won't have
any more money coming in.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.456
And by the way,
you do have
your own place.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.494
So, when I wanna visit you,
I have to be in that
awful basement?

07:06.526 --> 07:10.598
Not forever. Just until
things come together.
Which is when, Xander?

07:10.630 --> 07:13.000
'Cause right now,
things are looking
pretty un-together,

07:13.033 --> 07:15.101
and you can't
expect me just
to wait around for--

07:15.134 --> 07:18.170
Quiet, please.
Anya, what is this?

07:18.204 --> 07:21.742
What's going on
with you?
What's going on with me...

07:21.774 --> 07:26.480
is my arm hurts,
and I'm tired, and I
don't really feel like

07:26.514 --> 07:29.516
taking a tour
of beautiful things
that I can't have.

07:35.387 --> 07:37.790
I guess I'll just start
on that application.

07:37.824 --> 07:41.461
I think you'll like it.
I've been told I have
lovely penmanship.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.771
"Miscellaneous curses."
(chuckles)

07:51.805 --> 07:54.007
Brilliant.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.576
Lucky if I don't curse
my hands off at the wrist.
Oh!

07:58.245 --> 08:00.480
The Slayer
is not here.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.382
(gasps)
Rabbit's foot.
No, wait.

08:05.151 --> 08:09.557
(grunts)
That is
a fertility god.

08:09.589 --> 08:12.391
Feeble man.
You are not likely
to strike-- ugh!

08:18.999 --> 08:20.834
You are not the Slayer.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.437
You do not concern me.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.875
(growls)

08:31.545 --> 08:32.546
Ohh.

08:34.380 --> 08:39.418
-Like this, and this,
and this.
-That thing's pretty heavy.

08:39.451 --> 08:40.988
WILLOW: That's Oofdar.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.390
Goddess of childbirth.
She's got some
nice heft to her.

08:44.423 --> 08:46.894
Yeah.
How badly did you hurt him?

08:46.927 --> 08:50.563
Well, hurt, um--
maybe not hurt.

08:50.597 --> 08:53.332
Well, I-I'm sure
he was startled.

08:53.365 --> 08:56.604
Uh, yes, yes. I'd imagine
it gave him rather a turn.

08:56.636 --> 09:00.539
He ran away, huh?
Um, sort of more, uh,

09:00.573 --> 09:03.375
turned and swept out
majestically, I suppose.

09:03.409 --> 09:06.113
He said I didn't
concern him.

09:06.145 --> 09:09.048
So a mythic triumph
over a completely
indifferent foe.

09:09.081 --> 09:12.919
Well, I'm not dead
or unconscious,
so I say bravo for me.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.554
Some good demons in this one.
See if your guy's in here.

09:18.625 --> 09:23.062
So, you bought the magic shop,
and you were attacked
before it opened.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.865
Who's up for a swingin' chorus
of the "We Told You So"
Symphony?

09:25.899 --> 09:28.467
Owning this place
does seem kind of dangerous.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.437
Toth.
What?

09:31.471 --> 09:35.075
He called you a toth.
It's a British expression.
It means, like, moron.

09:35.107 --> 09:38.645
No. Toth is the name
of the demon.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.982
Be careful with that.

09:43.015 --> 09:47.654
Ancient demon. Very strong.
Last survivor
of the Tothric clan.

09:47.687 --> 09:50.658
It also says that for a demon,
he's unusually sophisticated.

09:50.691 --> 09:55.162
Sophisticated. So I should
discuss men's fashions with him
before I chop his head off?

09:55.195 --> 09:59.667
They're referring to
the fact that he does not
fight barehanded.

09:59.700 --> 10:05.272
He uses tools, devices.
Oh, he's also supposed
to be very focused.

10:05.304 --> 10:08.274
And since he mentioned
the Slayer, I think we
know what the focus is.

10:08.307 --> 10:12.980
He mentioned Buffy?
Where do we find him,
and how hard can I kill him?

10:13.013 --> 10:18.018
Well, there's no mention
of the types of places
he might frequent, but...

10:18.051 --> 10:20.687
I have an idea.

10:20.721 --> 10:25.292
He had a very specific
olfactory presence.

10:25.325 --> 10:28.294
Well, I guess we're off
to the old factory.
I hate that place.

10:29.863 --> 10:34.768
I'm joking.
I know what it means.
He smelled. Right?

10:34.802 --> 10:39.105
Some demon rituals
involve anointing with oils.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.042
Was it sort of sandalwoody?

10:42.075 --> 10:46.145
Um, not even remotely.
But he was very, um...

10:46.178 --> 10:47.980
distinctive.

10:53.586 --> 10:58.357
The city dump,
where smells go to relax
and be themselves.

10:58.390 --> 11:02.162
People say they're recycling.
They're not recycling.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.563
I found a spell so you
can't smell anything,

11:04.596 --> 11:08.067
but it does it by
taking your nose off,
so, no.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.937
(clattering)

11:14.240 --> 11:17.476
What are you doing here,
Spike?

11:17.509 --> 11:20.212
Oh, there's a nice
lady vampire who set up
a charming tearoom

11:20.246 --> 11:23.082
over the next pile
of crap.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.753
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm scavenging, ain't I?

11:25.786 --> 11:29.655
Very pretty.
GILES: Spike, um,

11:29.688 --> 11:33.525
we're looking for
a demon, um...
tall, robed,

11:33.559 --> 11:37.764
skin sort of
hanging off,
deep voice.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.700
You mean a great,
tall robey thing
like that one?

11:44.537 --> 11:47.407
Take cover!
Big guy! Kick her ass!

11:50.543 --> 11:54.447
Oh, very nice!
I was on your side!

11:54.480 --> 11:55.481
Watch out!
BUFFY: Ugh!

11:59.485 --> 12:01.321
Hey, you okay?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.591
WILLOW: Buffy, he's gone.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.394
I'm fine.
Easy. Easy.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.629
(groaning)

12:09.662 --> 12:11.597
RILEY: He disappeared.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.604
That had to hurt.
Yeah, yeah.

12:17.636 --> 12:19.172
Take it slowly.

12:54.173 --> 12:57.845
Anya?
Are you trying to use
the hot plate again?

12:57.878 --> 12:59.812
(insects buzzing)

13:07.720 --> 13:09.389
Uh-oh.

13:24.537 --> 13:28.008
(knocking)
Anya? An?

13:28.041 --> 13:30.677
Oh!
(groaning)

13:44.191 --> 13:45.557
Oh, my god!

13:47.759 --> 13:53.066
What? No way! Who is--

13:53.100 --> 13:57.803
Me? What am I doin'
in there? Buffy.

13:57.836 --> 14:01.875
Need Buffy. Huh!

14:03.009 --> 14:06.078
No, it ate my quarter.
Uh-huh.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.715
But, see,
I'm sort of having this
aggressively bad day.

14:08.748 --> 14:12.418
Ooh! I found a quarter.
I found a quarter.

14:12.451 --> 14:15.254
Well, ma'am,
for me, it is worth
getting excited about.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.893
(punching keypad)

14:19.927 --> 14:24.130
(line ringing)
Come on, Buffy.

14:29.101 --> 14:30.636
BUFFY:
Hello?

14:35.107 --> 14:36.775
They hung up.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.413
(sighs) Well, if this guy
wants to fight with weapons,

14:40.447 --> 14:44.350
I've got it covered
from "A" to "Z"--
from ax to...

14:44.384 --> 14:46.318
Zee other ax.

14:48.754 --> 14:51.224
Relax.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.559
Another day,
another demon.

14:53.592 --> 14:56.062
Right.
It'll be good.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.998
Hey...

15:02.434 --> 15:03.735
(gagging sounds)

15:03.769 --> 15:06.438
(coughing)

15:10.309 --> 15:12.445
My friend Sharon's
older brother
knows a girl who died

15:12.479 --> 15:14.280
'cause she choked
on her boyfriend's tongue.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.916
Go away, Dawn.
I'm not in your room.

15:16.950 --> 15:20.052
I'm in the hallway.
The hallway doesn't
belong to you.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.154
Get out of here.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.292
Mom, I can stand
in the hallway, right?

15:25.325 --> 15:27.293
She's watching us
like a big freak!

15:27.326 --> 15:31.097
Uh! This must be
my two-teenage-girls-
in-the-house headache.

15:31.130 --> 15:32.331
I thought it felt
familiar.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.801
Good work, Dawn.
You gave her a headache.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.570
I did not.
Did I give you
a headache, Mom?

15:37.604 --> 15:41.173
I'm sure part
of it is Buffy's.
But part of it is Dawn's.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.576
It's so nice you've
learned to share.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.046
You girls sort
this out yourselves.
It's good for you.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.118
She didn't say
I couldn't stand here. Hm.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.384
Ow!

16:14.706 --> 16:17.476
Very posh.

16:27.986 --> 16:30.657
Oh, Slayer.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.859
One of these days.

16:58.217 --> 17:01.254
Hey, Harris. Harris!

17:01.288 --> 17:03.722
Harris. Sorry. Yeah.

17:03.755 --> 17:07.492
In my trailer, okay? I'm talking
to all the guys today.
The job's winding down.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.961
Right.
I'll be right there.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.972
Welcome to payback,
Mr. Evil-Plan Face-Stealer.

17:22.409 --> 17:26.813
You take my life?
You get my being fired
absolutely free!

17:32.118 --> 17:35.721
Harris.
Where's your hard hat?

17:38.258 --> 17:40.058
Sit down.

17:49.102 --> 17:53.373
How long
you work here, Harris?
Huh? I'm not sure.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.175
About three months?
I guess. Yeah.

18:06.486 --> 18:09.256
And you haven't done
much construction work
before this. Is that right?

18:09.288 --> 18:11.790
I knew they were gonna
notice that.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.594
I have to tell you,
that's surprising,

18:14.626 --> 18:17.130
'cause your work here
has been first-rate.

18:17.163 --> 18:21.233
We have another job
lined up in Carlton
when you finish here.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.902
You ever think about
staying on full-time?

18:22.934 --> 18:27.173
What? Why isn't he
firing me-- him?

18:27.207 --> 18:30.942
I was thinking that
I'd have you head up
our interior carpentry crew.

18:30.977 --> 18:36.082
See how it goes.
It's more responsibility,
but the pay is better.

18:36.115 --> 18:40.452
That would be great.
A promotion? But I--

18:40.487 --> 18:43.055
I mean, he didn't--
doesn't he see
the shiny thing?

18:45.557 --> 18:49.761
Congratulations, Harris.
You and your girl should
go out and celebrate.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.798
I already have
an idea how.

18:54.866 --> 18:57.103
I was going to call
you, Mr. Harris,

18:57.135 --> 18:59.306
let you know
your credit
checked out fine,

18:59.338 --> 19:01.473
but I really didn't
think you'd be back.

19:01.508 --> 19:04.277
"Mr. Harris"?
Yeah, right.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.045
I'm sure you'll
like the building.

19:06.077 --> 19:09.682
I think someone said
you're currently in
your parents' basement?

19:09.715 --> 19:13.385
Right. There comes
a point where you either
have to move on,

19:13.420 --> 19:16.823
or just buy yourself
a Klingon costume
and go with it.

19:16.855 --> 19:19.959
(laughing)

19:19.991 --> 19:21.493
Well...

19:21.528 --> 19:23.663
I hope you'll be
happy here,
Mr. Harris.

19:23.695 --> 19:27.467
We're certainly
happy to have you.
Thank you.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.736
And if you need anything,

19:29.769 --> 19:33.573
day or night,
please call me.

19:35.040 --> 19:38.211
I, um-- I'm leaving
my home number here.

19:38.244 --> 19:41.180
She's coming on to him-- me.

19:41.213 --> 19:42.414
Call me.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.917
Even for, you know,

19:45.951 --> 19:48.555
non-business stuff.

19:48.587 --> 19:52.157
Maybe we could,
uh, do something?

19:52.191 --> 19:54.192
Please, lady.
That is so not me.

19:54.227 --> 19:57.730
He's too clean, for one thing,
and his socks are all matchy,
and--

19:59.699 --> 20:02.301
Remember, anytime.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.614
Anya, you there?

20:14.646 --> 20:17.884
Look, I know you're still mad,
but I figure you're probably
sittin' there

20:17.916 --> 20:20.920
pretending you're not home
but listening anyway.
Am not.

20:20.952 --> 20:25.191
Look, I have
something to show you.
Meet me at the apartment.

20:25.223 --> 20:27.626
You know the one. 9:00.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.628
(clicks, beeps)

20:39.739 --> 20:41.407
Yaaah!

20:48.515 --> 20:51.784
I won't let you do this!
WOMAN: What's going on
out there?

20:51.817 --> 20:54.086
You can't do this to me!

20:56.989 --> 20:59.025
Oh, man.
I need Buffy.

21:05.632 --> 21:09.301
XANDER DOUBLE: No, no.
He looked exactly like me.

21:09.336 --> 21:13.405
It stole my face.
We have to find it,
and we have to kill it.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.910
(panting)
She sees it's not me.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.680
Please, Buffy.
Resist his spell.

21:22.013 --> 21:23.450
Do this for me.

21:25.317 --> 21:28.621
Don't worry, Xander.
Whatever stole your face,

21:28.654 --> 21:30.490
it has to deal with
the Slayer now.

21:54.381 --> 21:58.518
Don't be scared, Wil.
Just listen.
It's me, Xander.

21:58.550 --> 22:02.654
And I can prove it.
Um, okay.

22:03.890 --> 22:08.126
Let's see.
Stuff only you
and me know.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.798
Okay!
On my seventh birthday,
I wanted a toy fire truck,

22:11.830 --> 22:14.500
and I didn't get it,
and you were real
nice about it,

22:14.534 --> 22:17.036
and then the house
next door burnt down,
and then real fire trucks came,

22:17.068 --> 22:19.405
and for years I thought
you set the fire for me.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.607
And if you did,
you can tell me.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.512
For a while last year, I thought
I was lactose intolerant,

22:26.546 --> 22:28.815
but it was just
some bad brie.

22:28.847 --> 22:32.551
Oh! Every Christmas, we watch
 Charlie Brown together,

22:32.585 --> 22:34.787
and I do the Snoopy dance.

22:41.394 --> 22:44.997
Xander, stop dancing.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.567
Aha! You called me Xander.

22:47.599 --> 22:51.336
Xander, shut up.
Why wouldn't I think
you were Xander?

22:51.369 --> 22:53.539
Oh. Huh.

22:53.573 --> 22:57.576
What's goin' on?
(panting)

22:57.609 --> 23:00.747
Okay. I woke up
in the dump this morning.

23:00.846 --> 23:02.914
Xander, the basement
isn't a dump.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.617
It-It's more like
a really nice hovel.

23:05.652 --> 23:09.121
No. The dump.
The city dump.

23:09.154 --> 23:14.393
I got hit last night.
Fall down, boom.
Woke up this morning.

23:14.426 --> 23:18.865
Uh-un. We walked you
home last night,
remember?

23:18.897 --> 23:20.967
You walked?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.436
Wil, did I do
anything weird?

23:24.471 --> 23:26.705
Did I wave any
shiny things around?

23:26.739 --> 23:29.208
Shiny things.
What are you talking about?

23:29.240 --> 23:31.877
Last night,
that wasn't me.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.212
There's a double
out there.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.083
Some... thing
has stolen my face,

23:37.115 --> 23:41.119
and it's going around
pretending to be me,
and it's hypnotizing people.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.823
It even got to Buffy
and Giles and Riley.

23:43.855 --> 23:45.791
It's over there right now,
and they have no idea.

23:45.825 --> 23:49.828
What's intriguing me
is that there are
a number of demons

23:49.862 --> 23:51.963
with the ability
to mimic a simple form,

23:51.998 --> 23:54.634
but, uh, this sounds
like more than that.

23:54.666 --> 23:57.636
Hold up. Do we really
have to figure out
what it is?

23:57.670 --> 24:01.140
Let's just go kill it.
RILEY: Yeah. When
the imposter's killed,

24:01.173 --> 24:04.076
the body'll probably turn back
into whatever it really is,
and then we'll know.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.978
Toth.

24:06.011 --> 24:09.147
The demon with
the creepy stick thing.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.852
Toth.
It's gotta be.

24:12.884 --> 24:16.422
He hit Xander with that blast,
and somehow it allowed him
to take Xander's form.

24:16.454 --> 24:19.157
Couldn't that be
what the creepy
stick thing did?

24:19.191 --> 24:22.428
Yes. I suppose.
Yes. Yes, it makes sense.

24:22.461 --> 24:27.165
A shape-shifting device.
It does make sense.
It must be Toth.

24:27.199 --> 24:30.702
It's a robot. It's an evil robot
constructed from evil parts

24:30.737 --> 24:33.772
that look like me,
designed to do evil.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.041
Uh-huh.
Or it's Toth.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.277
Or... it's Toth.

24:38.309 --> 24:40.547
I was gonna look
for Toth anyway.

24:40.579 --> 24:43.549
Guess now I start
looking for you.

24:43.583 --> 24:47.318
Should I go with you?
I told Anya to meet me
at my new place.

24:47.353 --> 24:50.355
I'd feel a whole lot better
knowing she's safe
from this creep.

24:50.388 --> 24:54.326
Go be with her.
I mean, if you were out there
looking for the double, too--

24:54.359 --> 24:58.530
Let's just say that
I wouldn't wanna run into you
and kill the wrong one.

24:58.565 --> 25:01.467
Good thinking.
When you kill this thing,
you'd better make sure

25:01.500 --> 25:04.336
you got the one
who's actually--
A demon.

25:04.369 --> 25:06.638
A demon has taken
my life from me,

25:06.673 --> 25:08.440
and he's living it
better than I do.

25:10.041 --> 25:13.011
Uh... Well,
we're working on it.

25:13.045 --> 25:17.182
There has to be a way
to get to Buffy
to un-hypnotize her.

25:17.215 --> 25:19.551
I'll find a spell
to snap her out of it.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.753
Right. Whatever.

25:23.388 --> 25:25.924
Xander, you sound a little--

25:25.958 --> 25:28.493
You have to help me
figure this out, you know.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.931
But I never help.
I get in trouble,
and Buffy saves me.

25:31.963 --> 25:35.602
That's not true.
Sometimes we all
help to save you.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.105
And sometimes
you're not in trouble.

25:42.741 --> 25:46.077
I'm just...
another great
humiliation.

25:46.112 --> 25:49.715
And this time,
it's even worse.

25:49.749 --> 25:53.352
This demon, he's,
like, taking my life,
and everyone's treating him--

25:53.384 --> 25:55.954
Everyone's treating
him like a grownup.

25:55.988 --> 26:00.425
Wil, I'm starting
to feel like--
Like what?

26:00.459 --> 26:03.730
Like... he's doing
everything better.

26:03.762 --> 26:07.133
He's smarter, and--

26:07.165 --> 26:09.434
I don't know.
Maybe I should just
let him have it.

26:09.468 --> 26:13.538
Take my life, please.
Xander, no.

26:13.571 --> 26:16.976
You're just tired
and all soggy.

26:17.009 --> 26:21.948
That's why it seems so hard,
but you can't let him just
take your whole existence.

26:21.980 --> 26:25.483
Why not? It's not like I was
doing anything so great with it.

26:25.517 --> 26:27.953
When I get to
the pearly gates,
I'm sure the guy's not gonna go,

26:27.987 --> 26:31.089
"Hey, what a kick-ass
comic book collection.
Come on in!"

26:31.123 --> 26:33.491
What have I got
that's even worth--

26:34.760 --> 26:36.261
Anya.

26:36.295 --> 26:41.166
You think he's after her?
She won't know. He can just--

26:41.200 --> 26:42.835
No. No way!

26:42.868 --> 26:45.503
No way. He can take anything,
but he can't have her!
I need her!

26:45.537 --> 26:48.840
Really?
He could be with her
right now.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.176
Figure out a spell,
something... "revealy."

26:51.210 --> 26:54.145
I gotta find her.
Xander,

26:54.180 --> 26:56.982
you already knew he was
taking over your life,

26:57.016 --> 26:59.786
and you didn't think about
Anya till just now?

26:59.818 --> 27:03.189
Hey, wait till you have
an evil twin.
See how you handle it.

27:05.356 --> 27:09.228
(door shuts)
I handled it fine.

27:11.663 --> 27:14.701
Anya? An?

27:20.873 --> 27:23.108
(beeps)
XANDER DOUBLE: Meet me
at the apartment.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.644
You know the one. 9:00.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.012
(clicks off, beeps)

27:33.585 --> 27:37.222
It's gotta be here.
Where is it?

27:37.256 --> 27:40.625
You're lying.
It's a trick.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.229
No. Trust me.

27:45.330 --> 27:49.535
You really got
this apartment?
I really did.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.971
And do you know why?

27:52.003 --> 27:54.840
The ceiling fans?
They're very attractive.

27:54.874 --> 27:59.177
No. It's because
I knew you wanted it.

27:59.211 --> 28:01.346
It's all for you.

28:07.419 --> 28:12.724
Anya, you didn't see me
today, did you?
I mean, we didn't talk?

28:12.759 --> 28:15.728
What do you mean?
I just got your
phone message. That's all.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.431
Good.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.436
So--

28:27.705 --> 28:30.541
(sighs)
What happens next?

28:30.576 --> 28:34.413
Well, at some point,
we take off our clothes.

28:34.445 --> 28:37.983
I mean, what happens
next in our lives?

28:39.317 --> 28:42.354
When do we get a car?
A car?

28:42.387 --> 28:44.923
And a boat. No, wait.
I don't mean a boat.

28:44.957 --> 28:48.426
I mean, a puppy,
or a child.
I have a list somewhere.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.864
What are you
talking about?
Just, we have to get going.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.299
I don't have time
just to let
these things happen.

28:54.333 --> 28:57.302
There's no hurry.
Yes, there is!

28:57.336 --> 29:00.271
There's a hurry, Xander.

29:00.306 --> 29:03.075
I'm dying.

29:03.108 --> 29:05.644
I may have as few
as 50 years left.

29:05.676 --> 29:08.780
Fifty years?
What is this?

29:10.115 --> 29:14.319
Oh, wait a minute.
This is about this.

29:15.253 --> 29:18.089
What about the sling?

29:18.124 --> 29:20.659
You haven't
been hurt like this
since you became human.

29:23.528 --> 29:25.998
Maybe it's
finally hitting you
what being human means.

29:28.299 --> 29:32.838
No. That's not it.
Yes. I think it is.

29:32.872 --> 29:36.174
You were gonna live
for thousands
of years.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.509
And now you're gonna
age and die.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.481
That must be terrifying.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.784
You don't understand
what it's like.

29:45.817 --> 29:48.487
Being suddenly human?

29:48.519 --> 29:50.556
I think I can get
what that would be like.

29:52.357 --> 29:55.126
And we can get
through it together.

29:55.161 --> 29:59.798
You can't make it
any different.
I'm going to get old.

29:59.832 --> 30:04.836
And you can't promise you'll
be with me when I'm wrinkly
and my teeth are artificial

30:04.871 --> 30:07.605
and stuck into my wrinkly mouth
with an adhesive.

30:07.638 --> 30:10.442
No, I can't
promise that.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.479
But it doesn't sound terrible,
and that's saying something.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.383
I promise you, Anya.

30:17.415 --> 30:20.352
Very soon, you won't
be thinking about
getting older.

30:27.558 --> 30:30.496
Get away from her!
Xander!

30:30.528 --> 30:32.564
Xander?
Get out.

30:34.066 --> 30:37.202
You don't belong here.
Anya, it's me.

30:38.836 --> 30:40.271
It's a demon.

30:41.772 --> 30:43.541
He stole my face.
He's trying
to trick you.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.082
Anya, you know
I'm me, right?
No!

30:53.952 --> 30:56.989
What is it?
Make it go away.

30:57.022 --> 30:59.090
So you're thinking
we split up?
Yeah.

30:59.125 --> 31:01.559
You check the places
where he might try and go
and blend in as Xander.

31:01.593 --> 31:04.596
I'll check
the places where Toth
might hang out.

31:04.630 --> 31:07.066
I swear, this time
I know I had that locked.

31:07.098 --> 31:10.536
Buffy, Toth looks like Xander.
We already know.
We're on our way.

31:10.568 --> 31:12.738
Wait a second.
How did you know
about this?

31:12.770 --> 31:15.673
He came to me.
I mean, Xander did.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.843
And he's in terrible shape.
We need to help him.

31:17.875 --> 31:20.112
RILEY: He came to us, too.

31:20.145 --> 31:23.249
No. We each had a Xander.
I mean, you didn't
have a Xander.

31:23.281 --> 31:25.616
You had a demon
in a Xander suit.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.019
What makes you so sure
that yours is the right one?

31:28.054 --> 31:33.125
Well, he knew stuff.
He did the Snoopy dance. Buffy,
it was Xander, and he needs us.

31:33.159 --> 31:35.560
Oh, dear lord.
RILEY: Buffy,

31:35.594 --> 31:38.130
our Xander--
did he seem a little--

31:38.163 --> 31:41.432
He seemed kind of
forceful and confident.
That's not Xander.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.202
I said, "Oh, dear lord."
You always say that.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.637
Well, it's always important.

31:46.672 --> 31:49.976
Neither Xander is a demon.

31:50.009 --> 31:53.412
Um, is one of them a robot?
What? No.

31:53.444 --> 31:57.383
No, um, the rod device,
it's called
a Ferula Gemina.

31:57.415 --> 32:01.853
It splits one person into half,
distilling personality traits
into two separate bodies.

32:01.953 --> 32:07.259
As near as I can tell, Toth was
attempting to split the Slayer
into two different entities.

32:07.292 --> 32:09.661
Two Buffies?
Yes.

32:09.694 --> 32:12.431
One with all the qualities
inherent in Buffy Summers.

32:12.463 --> 32:16.167
The other with everything
that belongs to
the Slayer alone--

32:16.201 --> 32:21.906
the strength,
the speed, the heritage--
and when it hit Xander,

32:21.940 --> 32:25.743
I think it separated him
into his strongest points
and his weakest.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.779
But which one's the real one?
They're both real.
They're both Xander.

32:28.814 --> 32:31.750
Neither one of them is evil.
There's nothing
in either of them

32:31.782 --> 32:33.986
that our Xander
didn't already possess.

32:34.019 --> 32:36.989
I still don't get
the original plan.
I mean, why do it?

32:37.022 --> 32:40.026
The Slayer half would be
like Slayer concentrate--
pretty un-killable.

32:40.058 --> 32:42.361
GILES: But the two halves
can't exist without each other.

32:42.394 --> 32:46.432
Kill the weaker Buffy half,
and the Slayer half dies.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.834
So, the same goes
for the Xanders.

32:48.866 --> 32:51.202
We lose one.
We lose them both.

32:51.237 --> 32:55.840
He's the demon!
Or possibly a robot.
Look at me.

32:55.874 --> 32:59.345
Look in my eyes.
Can't you see it's me?

33:02.248 --> 33:04.383
I-I don't know.

33:04.415 --> 33:07.818
Please! Look at him!
Listen to him!

33:07.853 --> 33:09.454
He's all smooth.

33:09.488 --> 33:13.558
You have to know it's me!
Don't worry, Anya.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.794
I'll get rid
of this thing.

33:15.826 --> 33:18.396
I'm thinking
this is gonna last
about 15 seconds.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.101
I'm thinking less.

33:29.607 --> 33:32.377
No, don't shoot him!

33:37.115 --> 33:39.384
Can't this thing
go any faster?

33:39.417 --> 33:41.420
Ultimate driving machine,
my ass.

33:41.452 --> 33:43.388
We're pushing 70.

33:47.093 --> 33:49.694
Riley, do you wish--
No.

33:52.064 --> 33:55.601
No? You don't even
know what I was
gonna say.

33:55.634 --> 33:59.704
Yes, I do. Um,
you wanted to know if
I wished you got hit

33:59.738 --> 34:04.242
by the ferula gemina,
got split in two.

34:04.276 --> 34:08.447
Well, you have been
kind of rankly about
the whole Slayer gig.

34:08.480 --> 34:12.617
Instead of having Slayer-Buffy,
you could have Buffy-Buffy.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.786
I have Buffy-Buffy.

34:14.820 --> 34:18.224
Being the Slayer's part of who
you are. You keep thinking
I don't get that, but--

34:18.257 --> 34:23.027
It's just... I know how
un-fun it can be--

34:23.061 --> 34:26.565
the bad hours,
frequent bruising,
cranky monsters.

34:26.597 --> 34:28.567
Buffy.

34:28.599 --> 34:30.735
If you led a perfectly
normal life,

34:30.768 --> 34:32.971
you wouldn't be half
as crazy as you are.

34:33.003 --> 34:36.942
I gotta have that.
I gotta have it all.
We're talkin' toes, elbows,

34:36.974 --> 34:40.411
the whole
bad-ice-skating-movie
obsession, everything.

34:40.445 --> 34:42.447
There's no part of you
I'm not in love with.

34:50.655 --> 34:53.425
Oh, we better
get there soon.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.927
If Xander kills himself,
he's dead.

34:57.195 --> 34:58.429
You know what I mean.

35:01.032 --> 35:04.536
Let go!
I have to kill
the demon-bot!

35:05.704 --> 35:06.804
ANYA: Ow!

35:06.838 --> 35:09.641
Anya. Get out of the way.

35:09.675 --> 35:13.411
Xander!
It's all right, Buffy.
I have him.

35:13.445 --> 35:16.181
No, Buffy! I'm me!
Help me!

35:16.215 --> 35:18.416
My gun.
He's got my gun.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.117
You own a gun?

35:20.152 --> 35:23.722
Xander--
gun-holding Xander--
give it to me.

35:33.831 --> 35:37.503
Buffy, which one's real?
I am.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.137
No, I am.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.873
(grunting)

35:41.907 --> 35:44.210
Thank you.

35:44.242 --> 35:46.411
Uh! Ow!

35:48.480 --> 35:50.481
Wild.
Yeah.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.820
Okay, Xander... s.
(sighs)

35:54.853 --> 35:59.157
You've been split in two.
But you're both Xander,
and you can't kill each other.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.827
I mean, well, you could,
but it would be really bad.

36:04.862 --> 36:07.132
No way.
He can't be me.

36:07.164 --> 36:09.835
He's all fancy.

36:09.867 --> 36:12.704
We can prove
you're both Xander.
Yeah. How?

36:14.739 --> 36:17.476
Um--
Well, there has to be a way.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.976
Oh, what number
am I thinking of?

36:19.010 --> 36:20.311
I don't think
that's gonna do it.

36:20.346 --> 36:23.181
BOTH: Eleven and a half.
Wrong. Oh! But see?

36:25.284 --> 36:29.721
No. We're not the same.
We're all different.

36:29.755 --> 36:32.324
Different properties
went into each of you,
but you're both Xander.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.760
Different properties?
What different properties?

36:34.793 --> 36:37.663
Uh... Uh, you know.

36:37.695 --> 36:42.534
Uh, sense of direction.
Good night vision.
Stuff like that.

36:42.568 --> 36:45.771
Oh, but he has
a thing, in his pocket.

36:45.804 --> 36:50.041
-A shiny disk that stuns
and disorients.
-What disk?

36:50.074 --> 36:51.277
Cover your eyes!

36:51.309 --> 36:52.610
This?
It'll melt your brain!

36:57.715 --> 36:59.217
Look.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.052
It's a nickel
someone flattened
on the railroad track.

37:01.085 --> 37:04.389
I found it on
the construction site.
I thought it was cool.

37:04.422 --> 37:08.025
-It's not magic.
-No, I--

37:08.059 --> 37:10.528
Huh.

37:10.561 --> 37:14.733
It is kinda cool.
Washington's still there,
but he's all smushy.

37:14.766 --> 37:17.369
-And he may be Jefferson.
-ANYA: Okay.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.804
Isn't anyone
gonna tell me why
there are two Xanders?

37:19.838 --> 37:21.672
I will, on the way to Giles's.
Let's go.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.382
Oh, great. Rod boy.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.384
I will not miss again,
Slayer.

37:32.418 --> 37:33.985
The gun! Pick up
the little gun pieces!

37:37.755 --> 37:40.458
Hey, I just made a small
cleaning deposit.

37:40.492 --> 37:43.661
(grunting, groaning)

38:08.119 --> 38:09.855
Sword.

38:13.324 --> 38:15.793
Aah!

38:22.467 --> 38:26.036
Oh, yeah.
(smacks lips)
That cleaning deposit's gone.

38:26.070 --> 38:28.306
I was thinking
the same thing.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.476
Hey, do you suppose
we're both Xander?

38:31.577 --> 38:34.380
Look and admire, ladies.

38:34.413 --> 38:38.849
Look, there's a scar there,
and there's the same one
right there.

38:38.884 --> 38:41.619
WILLOW: It's all doubled.

38:41.652 --> 38:47.358
This zit, and this...
kinda funny dippy thing.

38:47.393 --> 38:50.528
And this weird little hair
that grows in the wrong way.

38:50.561 --> 38:53.297
Okay! Back off, ladies.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.800
Psychologically,
this is fascinating.

38:55.833 --> 39:00.539
Doesn't it make everyone want
to lock them in separate rooms
and do experiments on them?

39:00.572 --> 39:03.574
Just me, then.

39:03.608 --> 39:09.047
So, um, you Xanders really do
have all the same memories,
all the same--

39:09.079 --> 39:12.317
(clicks tongue)
physical attributes?
(chuckles)

39:12.349 --> 39:14.351
We're completely
identical.

39:14.385 --> 39:18.989
Yeah. We checked out
some stuff in the car
on the way over.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.858
Fingerprints.

39:20.891 --> 39:25.262
Well, maybe we shouldn't
do this reintegration thing
right away.

39:25.295 --> 39:29.199
See, I can take the boys home,
and, you know, we can all have
sex together,

39:29.233 --> 39:33.038
and then, you know,
just slap 'em back together
in the morning.

39:33.070 --> 39:35.673
-XANDER DOUBLE: She's joking.
-No, she's not!

39:35.706 --> 39:40.210
She entirely wants to have sex
with us together,
which is... wrong,

39:40.244 --> 39:43.449
and-- and it would
be very confusing.

39:43.481 --> 39:46.617
We just need
to arrange the candles.

39:46.652 --> 39:50.755
Also, we should continue
to pretend we heard none of
the disturbing sex talk.

39:50.789 --> 39:54.559
Check.
Candles and pretense.

39:54.592 --> 39:59.297
It's not like it'd be cheating.
They're both Xander.
Now, hold on a sec.

39:59.329 --> 40:02.768
If you weren't putting a whammy
on people with the shiny thing,
how'd you do it?

40:02.800 --> 40:05.936
How'd you get
the promotion?
Well, I'm good at that stuff.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.739
-I am?
-Yeah.

40:07.773 --> 40:10.909
And, hey, how 'bout
that lady, huh?
The apartment manager.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.612
How weird was it
when she called me "Mr."?
Yeah.

40:13.644 --> 40:15.646
We're ready.
We should do it now.

40:18.115 --> 40:21.418
-ANYA: Well, what do we do
if it doesn't work?
-BOTH: Kill us both, Spock!

40:21.452 --> 40:24.088
(laughing)

40:24.121 --> 40:27.057
They're kinda the same now.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.427
Yes, he's clearly
a bad influence on himself.

40:29.460 --> 40:32.998
Hey, summon the goddess.
Chant the chant.
Let's do it.

40:33.030 --> 40:37.335
Actually, it's not that hard.
Your natural state
is to be together.

40:37.367 --> 40:40.170
Toth's spell
is doing all the work
of keeping you apart.

40:40.204 --> 40:43.007
I just have to break it.
So, you two...

40:43.041 --> 40:46.077
stand right here.

40:46.110 --> 40:51.248
Side by side. We don't want you
to end up with two fronts,
now, do we?

40:51.282 --> 40:53.217
Are you sure you know
how to do this?

40:54.853 --> 40:58.657
(exhales)
Here we go.
Brace yourselves.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.693
Let the spell be ended.

41:02.728 --> 41:04.829
You gotta be kidding.

41:04.862 --> 41:06.998
"Let the spell be ended."
That's not gonna work.

41:09.635 --> 41:10.735
Oh.

41:13.371 --> 41:16.574
I liked it the other way.
Put him back.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.523
Getting nostalgic?

41:31.556 --> 41:35.626
I don't know.
At first, it's just a place.

41:35.661 --> 41:38.128
Then you start
to make memories,

41:38.163 --> 41:40.865
and then you're like,
that's where Spike slept,

41:40.898 --> 41:45.369
and there, that's where
Anya and I drowned
the Sepavro demon.

41:45.402 --> 41:48.539
Oh! And right there,
that's where I got
my heart all ripped out.

41:50.440 --> 41:52.210
I really hate
this place.

41:54.244 --> 41:57.815
Anya. Ohh!
I see you've joined
the not-sling-wearing crowd.

41:57.849 --> 42:02.253
Yes. I'm feeling better.
And I anticipate many
years before my death--

42:02.286 --> 42:04.856
excepting disease
or air-bag failure.

42:04.889 --> 42:07.391
That sounds nice.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.362
Oh! Presents?

42:12.396 --> 42:16.201
Not unless you want my
collection of Babylon 5
commemorative plates,

42:16.233 --> 42:18.036
which you cannot have.

42:18.068 --> 42:19.670
I just thought
you could help
carry a little.

42:19.704 --> 42:23.440
Me?
Buffy has super strength.

42:23.474 --> 42:26.244
Why don't we just load her up
like one of those
little horses?

42:26.277 --> 42:29.380
Anya. Please.

42:29.414 --> 42:33.585
Fine.
I'm just your slave.

42:36.086 --> 42:40.358
How is it that she can always
make me feel Suave Xander's
left the building?

42:40.391 --> 42:44.094
You two have your friction,
but she digs
the whole package.

42:44.128 --> 42:46.864
It's obvious.
Still, I do
envy you sometimes.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.134
I mean, for the sanity.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.969
Not that I'm
still into Buffy.
Not that I ever was.

42:52.003 --> 42:55.239
Hey, I'm well aware
of how lucky I am--

42:55.273 --> 42:56.807
like, lottery lucky.

42:58.809 --> 43:01.746
Buffy's like nobody else
in the world.

43:01.780 --> 43:04.581
When I'm with her,
it's like-- it's like
I'm split in two.

43:04.615 --> 43:07.418
Half of me is just
on fire,

43:07.452 --> 43:09.586
going crazy
if I'm not touching her.

43:09.621 --> 43:13.925
The other half
is so still and peaceful,

43:13.958 --> 43:16.561
just perfectly content.

43:16.594 --> 43:20.364
Just knows,
this is the one.

43:24.335 --> 43:26.336
But she doesn't love me.

43:33.478 --> 43:35.079
You got something else
for me to carry?

43:35.112 --> 43:38.684
Uh, you can help me
pack this.
Sure.

43:40.018 --> 43:43.320
Mm. Sure.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.065
Grr! Arrgh!
