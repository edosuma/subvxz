16:04.093 --> 16:06.966
one of her delicious
soy protein shakes.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.445
-No, no,
I--I'm not even hungry.

16:08.489 --> 16:11.013
-No, it's no trouble. Really.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.710
I'll get some strawberries
from the garden.

16:12.754 --> 16:13.929
She'll like those.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.322
-[door opens, closes]
-Hm.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.716
-Does she not talk?

16:18.760 --> 16:21.154
-Hasn't in years.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.243
-What happened to her?

16:23.286 --> 16:26.202
-Sometimes when you stay
quiet for too long, it sticks.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.248
[distant glass shatters]

16:28.291 --> 16:29.771
I'm going to go
check on that shake.

16:33.209 --> 16:34.994
[footsteps receding,
floorboard creaking]

16:36.473 --> 16:40.390
Hey, Priscilla,
let me help you with that.

16:40.434 --> 16:46.048
[distant blender whirring]

16:46.092 --> 16:48.181
[tense burst of music]

16:48.224 --> 16:49.617
[distant creaking]

16:53.273 --> 16:54.361
[distant blender whirring]

16:54.404 --> 16:55.275
[door shuts]

16:56.841 --> 16:59.061
[tense music continues]

16:59.105 --> 17:02.934
Sorry. That was a whole drama
with Butch and the garden.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.632
You would not believe
how much dirt goes into

17:04.675 --> 17:07.069
this whole
fruit and vegetable thing.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.332
Make sure you finish
the whole thing.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.899
Breakfast is the most important
meal of the day,

17:10.942 --> 17:13.119
or at least
that's what they say.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.772
-It tastes weird.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.078
[footsteps]

17:16.122 --> 17:17.949
-So, how's the shake?

17:17.993 --> 17:20.126
-Delicious.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.389
-I told you. [chuckles]

17:22.432 --> 17:23.999
Sunny,
you'll have the works, right?

17:24.043 --> 17:25.696
-Yes, please.
-BUTCH: There you go.

17:28.308 --> 17:33.008
So, Karma, your mom tells me

17:33.052 --> 17:36.490
that you got into
some really fine schools.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.495
You must be very excited
about next year.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.410
[slams her glass]

17:43.453 --> 17:45.151
-I'm sorry,
but can we talk about

17:45.194 --> 17:47.240
what's actually going on here
for a minute?

17:47.283 --> 17:49.851
-Karma. Don't be rude.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.680
-No. It's...
it's quite all right.

17:52.723 --> 17:54.464
But nothing's going on.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.379
You're safe here.

17:56.423 --> 17:59.034
That fence outside?
It's impenetrable.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.124
The gate we have chained
and padlocked.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.692
There are motion sensors
all around the edges,

18:04.735 --> 18:08.217
so we're gonna know if anybody
gets too close for comfort.

18:08.261 --> 18:13.396
The only way anybody gets in
is if I let them in.

18:13.440 --> 18:17.096
And that's not going to happen.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.532
-I just wish you guys
would stop acting

18:18.575 --> 18:19.924
like everything's okay.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.017
-Old habits die hard, I guess.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.980
-I'm not feeling very well.
May I please be excused?

18:32.023 --> 18:33.547
-Of course. You want to lie down
in our room,

18:33.590 --> 18:34.983
you're more than welcome to.

18:35.026 --> 18:37.203
-No, that's okay.

[phone thuds]

19:08.408 --> 19:09.583
-Thank you, darling.

19:13.108 --> 19:15.110
-Was it true
what you said to her?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.504
About how safe it is here?

19:17.547 --> 19:19.201
-Yeah.

19:19.245 --> 19:22.335
There are no cell phone towers,
no data, no cloud.

19:22.378 --> 19:23.988
[water running on dishes]

19:24.032 --> 19:26.730
No one out there
even knows we're here.

19:26.774 --> 19:28.471
SUNNY: And Paul?

19:28.515 --> 19:30.821
Where is he?

19:30.865 --> 19:32.736
-Well, the authorities
were last tracking him

19:32.780 --> 19:34.434
in Oaxaca, Mexico.

19:36.784 --> 19:39.830
-But somebody dropped
that note at our place.

19:39.874 --> 19:42.093
-He could've paid
anybody to do that.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.791
Not necessarily a believer.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.359
[water running]

19:46.402 --> 19:49.362
-How many do you think
he still has?

19:49.405 --> 19:50.232
-[faint creaking]
-BUTCH: Well, Wendell's never

19:50.276 --> 19:51.842
left his side.

19:51.886 --> 19:54.976
A big, quiet man always
shows up in the reports.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.717
I don't need to tell you--

19:56.760 --> 20:00.199
I mean, Paul is basically
the Pied Piper of lost souls.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.636
He can get anyone
to follow him through fire

20:02.679 --> 20:05.116
and not ask for water
on the other side.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.205
-[chuckles]

20:10.557 --> 20:11.993
But that far in in Mexico.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.213
I thought he was
sticking closer to TJ.

20:16.432 --> 20:19.087
-Well, a few too many girls
disappeared.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.784
He had to move on.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.482
-Yeah.

20:22.525 --> 20:25.920
In some ways, I'm sure Mexico
is perfect for him.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.791
Remember when all those
factory women turned up missing

20:27.835 --> 20:28.705
a few years back?

20:30.141 --> 20:31.447
-Yeah.

20:31.491 --> 20:34.755
Well, as long as
you're poor and brown,

20:34.798 --> 20:37.627
no one seems to care.

20:37.671 --> 20:38.933
-[breathes deeply]

[knife thuds]

21:02.348 --> 21:05.525
-I'm sorry if I scared you
last night.

21:05.568 --> 21:08.615
That's part of why I don't like
talking about your father.

21:08.658 --> 21:10.660
I don't want to give you fear
that isn't yours.

21:10.704 --> 21:14.838
-It's okay. I just wish you
wouldn't treat me like a child.

21:14.882 --> 21:17.667
-Honey, you are a child.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.452
It's my job to treat you
like one.

21:19.495 --> 21:22.150
-I'm the same age now
as you were when you had me.

21:22.193 --> 21:24.239
-Believe me,
I was a child then, too.

21:29.026 --> 21:30.289
-Do you trust him?

21:30.332 --> 21:32.029
-Who?
-Butch.

21:32.073 --> 21:34.118
-Absolutely. With my life.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.254
-Mom, I think there was
something in that shake.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.082
I don't feel right.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.345
-No, I'm sure it's just nerves.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.216
Look, Butch went to
an awful lot of trouble

21:45.260 --> 21:46.957
to make sure he didn't
have to hurt people anymore.

21:47.001 --> 21:48.263
He's not going to
start again now.

21:49.525 --> 21:51.484
-That's comforting.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.312
-Maybe you should lie down,
like he said.

21:56.445 --> 21:57.751
Come.

Ssshhhh.

I'll be right outside
if you need anything, okay?

represents reincarnation.

24:41.915 --> 24:43.960

24:44.004 --> 24:45.832
before they're reborn
as adult flies

24:45.875 --> 24:49.009
who then give birth
to new larvae,

24:49.052 --> 24:51.098
beginning the cycle
all over again.

-I'm--I'm--I'm so sorry. I--
-BUTCH: You were scared.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.538
And wondering if I was
the embodiment of everything

24:56.582 --> 24:57.800
you are running from.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.720
I don't blame you.

25:04.764 --> 25:07.810
-What are these?
That--that mask, I--

25:07.854 --> 25:09.595
-They're reminders
of why I left.

25:12.598 --> 25:15.339
I keep these in case
I'm ever tempted to go back.

25:18.255 --> 25:23.217
This is our daughter, Cindy,
the night she died.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.523
-What happened?

25:25.741 --> 25:28.265
-A failed reincarnation.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.095
I'm surprised your mother
hasn't told you about them.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.706
-No. She won't tell me
any of it.

25:33.749 --> 25:37.579
It's like it never happened.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.103
Is that why you left?

25:40.147 --> 25:43.106
-Yeah. And why I sold out
every friend I had

25:43.150 --> 25:46.719
to try and send
your father to prison.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.590
Instead,
I loosed him on Mexico,

25:48.634 --> 25:50.244
and guaranteed
my wife and I would live

25:50.287 --> 25:52.594
running from our shadows
for the rest of our days.

25:55.902 --> 25:59.427
There is some beauty in it.

25:59.470 --> 26:04.563
The promise of a life
never ends.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.739
The end to the fear of death.

26:08.697 --> 26:11.004
And in my experience,

26:11.047 --> 26:16.313
the more we resist
the inevitable,

26:16.357 --> 26:17.663
the more we bring it on.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.405
-I need--I need some air.

26:21.449 --> 26:23.538
-Well, we got plenty of that.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.540
I'll go with you.
-No, no. I'd rather be alone.

from the shed

considering how your mother is.

32:15.455 --> 32:18.806
-Fuck you.
Where--where is she?

32:18.849 --> 32:21.026
-There you go.
You're catching up.

32:21.069 --> 32:24.464
There you go...
uh, she's where she should be.

32:27.510 --> 32:30.731
-You're not real.
You're not real.

32:30.774 --> 32:31.993
-Oh, yes I am.

32:33.821 --> 32:36.650
You're seeing things, you see,

32:36.693 --> 32:41.002
because you're very,
very close to divinity.

32:42.264 --> 32:44.353
I'm curious:
Are you a virgin?

32:44.397 --> 32:47.226
-What? What...?

32:47.269 --> 32:48.575
-Do boys want to touch you?

32:48.618 --> 32:51.404
When even like probably not

32:51.447 --> 32:53.319
if they find out who
your father is, right?

32:53.362 --> 32:56.235
Maybe they get off on it.
[laughs]

32:56.278 --> 32:57.671
-That's disgusting.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.501
-I'm guessing virgin.

33:01.544 --> 33:04.721
I'm guessing
you're a virgin, yeah.

33:04.765 --> 33:07.072
You don't smell like a slut.
[sniffs]

33:09.204 --> 33:12.599
I can smell one of them
from across the room.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.470
-What do you want from me?

33:14.514 --> 33:16.298
Why am--why are you here?

33:16.342 --> 33:18.039
-What do I want from you?

33:18.083 --> 33:21.347
You know, I believe in choice.

33:23.262 --> 33:25.394
Free choice, okay?

33:25.438 --> 33:28.267
You know what that is, right?
I want you to kill a mouse.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.314
All you gotta do is...

33:32.358 --> 33:35.056
do this,
put his little head in there...

33:35.100 --> 33:36.014
[mousetrap snaps]

33:37.145 --> 33:38.929
It's over. Dead.

33:38.973 --> 33:40.018
-I don't kill animals.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.758
-[laughs]

33:41.802 --> 33:48.026
Did you know
that Hitler was a vegetarian?

[mousetrap thuds]

33:53.944 --> 33:55.685
Or...

33:55.729 --> 34:00.212
You know, you could die here
and then he'll eat you.

34:00.255 --> 34:03.084
You want to be eaten by a mouse?

34:03.128 --> 34:04.477
-So why don't you
just kill me right now

34:04.520 --> 34:06.914
and get it over with?

34:06.957 --> 34:09.743
-You really think
I would just kill you, huh?

34:09.786 --> 34:11.223
You're my daughter, Karma.

34:11.266 --> 34:12.833
What kind of a monster
do you think I am?

34:17.707 --> 34:18.969

You know, you're all
the same, aren't you?

Just all full of
your own desires.

36:59.913 --> 37:01.219
That's the most
important thing, right?

37:05.832 --> 37:06.963
I should've had a son.

you're going?

37:44.087 --> 37:46.307
You can let go of her now.

37:46.351 --> 37:51.181
You know, next time you do that,
you're gonna get shot.

37:51.225 --> 37:52.661
All right?

37:52.705 --> 37:54.097
You can go, Wendell.

What are you so serious about?

You know I'm just
joking around, right?

That shaking thing.
It means I'm getting to you.

It's a really bad habit.

38:24.519 --> 38:25.694
No?

38:29.394 --> 38:32.310
And they let you
into Harvard, huh?

38:32.353 --> 38:34.312
[laughs]

38:34.355 --> 38:35.661
You know what he did?

38:36.836 --> 38:39.317
He got a bunch of monkeys,

38:39.360 --> 38:42.015
and he took their mother
away from them.

38:42.058 --> 38:45.235
And then he gave them
a choice of mom:

38:47.499 --> 38:52.895
one made out of wire,
to feed them.

38:52.939 --> 38:58.945
Or a nice, you know,
soft, nice, cozy,

38:58.988 --> 39:02.688
comfortable, gentle mother
to watch them starve.

39:05.212 --> 39:08.215
Which one do you think
they picked, huh?

39:08.258 --> 39:09.608
'Cause I'm trying to find out:

39:09.651 --> 39:11.392
Are you a real girl?

Or a fucking monkey?

39:14.134 --> 39:17.398

they picked, huh?

39:40.595 --> 39:42.292
[sucks through his teeth]
Ooh.

39:42.336 --> 39:45.600
No. Of course they picked
the nice, soft, cozy, warm,

comfortable mother
to watch them starve.

39:50.475 --> 39:54.174

if you want.

You can go run away.
It's open.

Ooh.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.409
Except for one thing.

40:11.452 --> 40:12.888
Uh, your mom is staying here.

40:15.369 --> 40:18.328
-No. No. I won't leave her.

40:18.372 --> 40:19.417
-Oh yeah, you will.

40:20.592 --> 40:22.202
Yeah, yeah, you are. Yeah.

40:22.245 --> 40:25.858
-No. No. No,
I'm not leaving without my mom.

40:25.901 --> 40:27.294
-You got about five minutes
to make up your mind

40:27.337 --> 40:28.469
because Wendell's
gonna come back out

41:10.555 --> 41:13.079
A little trouble
with your starter there?

41:13.122 --> 41:15.647
That's because I told Wendell
to disengage it,

'cause you ain't going nowhere.

a word of advice?

42:11.224 --> 42:12.442
-Shhh.

42:15.881 --> 42:18.448
-[whispering] I've spent
a lot of time with your father.

42:18.492 --> 42:21.800
And at this point, struggling
can only make things worse.

42:21.843 --> 42:23.845
He wants to break your spirit.

42:23.889 --> 42:25.586
It's not personal.

42:25.630 --> 42:29.982
It's not about violence.
This is just what he does.

42:30.025 --> 42:31.723
He wants to crawl
inside your head

42:31.766 --> 42:34.856
and make you
just as cruel as he is.

42:34.900 --> 42:36.423

was getting in here

-I can promise you,
it wasn't me.

help that man again.

she should be, all right?

one way or the other.

-Or what?

43:52.151 --> 43:54.240
Well, I tell you, um,

43:56.198 --> 43:58.940
you're never gonna
see your mother again.

43:58.984 --> 44:00.115
How about that?

44:03.162 --> 44:06.426
-So if I eat this,
I can see my mom?

44:06.469 --> 44:08.950
-What's so wonderful
about mothers?

44:10.560 --> 44:12.214

so goddamned important

44:12.258 --> 44:14.347
about a mother,
that might help.

What's so goddamned important
about being a mother?

44:30.102 --> 44:35.281
I was thinking maybe we should
ask, uh, Priscilla.

44:35.324 --> 44:36.891
She's a mom. She would know.

44:36.935 --> 44:38.676
Maybe she has some insight.

-You know she doesn't speak.

Please.

44:42.723 --> 44:44.725
-Yeah, well.

between these two, do you?

you killed their daughter.

45:22.981 --> 45:25.157
But these two
haven't done anything.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.115

you want with me.

She was the first one.

I didn't eat her.

WENDELL: Stay here.

48:04.272 --> 48:05.534
Come on. Stand up.

48:07.232 --> 48:08.450
Here.

48:14.892 --> 48:17.895
-[laughing]

48:19.418 --> 48:27.556
[clears throat] You know, um...
I'm very proud of you.

48:28.906 --> 48:30.908
What you did at lunchtime.

48:32.170 --> 48:36.130
You earned the right of choice.

48:36.174 --> 48:37.262
These two?

48:39.699 --> 48:43.529
I'll fucking kill them both
right now.

48:43.572 --> 48:45.096
I'll stab them to death.

48:47.707 --> 48:49.927
But you earned the right
to decide.

48:53.017 --> 48:57.499
You kill one of them
or I'll do them both.

49:01.199 --> 49:02.896
-Karma.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.898
Karma, I'm begging you.

49:04.942 --> 49:06.900
Kill me, leave Priscilla.

49:06.944 --> 49:08.380
Let Priscilla live.

49:08.423 --> 49:09.903
Baby...

49:13.646 --> 49:15.169
please.

49:15.213 --> 49:16.692
-Come on.

49:20.827 --> 49:22.133
Good girl.

49:24.004 --> 49:26.311
You could actually save a life.

49:29.096 --> 49:30.968
BUTCH: Kill me!

49:31.011 --> 49:32.360
Please, Karma.

49:33.622 --> 49:34.972
-Do it!

49:37.235 --> 49:39.063
The time is now.

49:40.412 --> 49:42.980
Butch or Priscilla, which one?
Who you gonna do?

49:45.417 --> 49:47.201
-Let them both go.

49:51.292 --> 49:55.035
-[Paul laughs]

49:55.079 --> 49:58.038
You're gonna stab yourself,
is that it?

49:58.082 --> 50:00.084
Yeah, you know how hard
that is to do?

50:02.912 --> 50:05.393
You're not even going to get
through your T-shirt, all right?

50:21.844 --> 50:22.889
[switchblade clicks]

50:24.195 --> 50:29.069
Let's give Butch
a really good show.

50:29.113 --> 50:30.244
What do you think?

50:32.116 --> 50:33.595
Huh? All right.

50:33.639 --> 50:37.860
-No!! No.

50:42.691 --> 50:44.041
-[agonal cough]

50:45.390 --> 50:46.913
[Paul laughs]

50:52.440 --> 50:55.052
[Butch sobbing]

51:09.283 --> 51:10.197
PAUL: You know,

51:11.894 --> 51:16.943
when I was a kid, I really
didn't get fed enough.

51:18.858 --> 51:22.949
My mother didn't really
feed me good.

51:22.992 --> 51:25.517
So, one day I took a stick.

51:25.560 --> 51:30.739
I was so fucking hungry that

51:30.783 --> 51:32.872
I killed a rat.

51:32.915 --> 51:36.267
With a stick. And I ate it.

51:36.310 --> 51:38.660
That's how, you know,
hungry I was.

51:38.704 --> 51:41.141
See, and there's a rat,
right there.

51:43.448 --> 51:46.799
You know what it's like to
have a rat in your life?

51:46.842 --> 51:49.845
You know, who wants that? Right?

51:49.889 --> 51:51.804
That's not good for Papa.
Is it?

51:53.240 --> 51:55.721
A rat, on a stick.

51:55.764 --> 51:57.636
Open up your mouth, rat.

51:57.679 --> 51:59.290
Open up!

52:00.943 --> 52:02.336
-Fuck you.

52:04.295 --> 52:06.688
-[groans] Mom?

52:06.732 --> 52:08.603
Mom?
-PAUL: Open up your mouth!

52:08.647 --> 52:10.039
-I thought you were dead.

52:10.083 --> 52:12.825
He told me that you...
Are you okay?

52:12.868 --> 52:15.436
Where were you? Mom!

52:18.874 --> 52:21.355
-[Butch gurgles]
-[Karma gasping]

52:21.399 --> 52:22.878
Mom!

52:25.577 --> 52:27.448
Mom!

52:27.492 --> 52:30.190
What's going on? What?
Is he making you do this?

52:30.234 --> 52:32.453
-Nothing.
No, no, of course not.

52:32.497 --> 52:33.715
-So you just decided
to come out

52:33.759 --> 52:35.587
and save his life
instead of mine?

52:35.630 --> 52:38.851
-I believe in
the power of choice, honey.

52:38.894 --> 52:41.506
-That's something he thinks;
that's not something you think.

52:41.549 --> 52:43.421
-We think the same things.

52:43.464 --> 52:45.423
-Since when?!

52:45.466 --> 52:47.207
-Let's talk
about this later, okay?

52:47.251 --> 52:51.037
You're tired and you don't know
what you're saying.

52:51.080 --> 52:53.692
-I thought we were
best friends, Mom.

52:53.735 --> 52:56.042
-Of course we are.

52:56.085 --> 52:59.828
But this is the highest honor
I could hope for for you, Karma.

52:59.872 --> 53:01.221
-What are you talking about?

53:01.265 --> 53:04.181
How--how is this an honor?

53:04.224 --> 53:06.183
Did he drug you? Mom?

53:09.882 --> 53:13.102
-Hey, listen.
You know what?

53:13.146 --> 53:17.281
This woman right here
has never wavered against me,

53:17.324 --> 53:22.590
never went away from me,
for 17 years.

53:22.634 --> 53:24.897
You know, she gave birth to you,
you know,

53:24.940 --> 53:26.115
to save her own skin,

53:26.159 --> 53:29.075
but nevertheless,
she did do that.

53:33.688 --> 53:36.256
-The path is clear, Karma.

53:38.302 --> 53:39.955
The soul may reject the vessel,

53:39.999 --> 53:42.523
but not if she's
a perfect genetic match.

53:45.874 --> 53:47.136
A daughter.

53:51.402 --> 53:53.665
-You bred me for him?

53:57.321 --> 53:59.888
[spits]

53:59.932 --> 54:03.240
You fucking bitch.
You don't deserve to live!

54:03.283 --> 54:04.937
[slap thrown]

54:08.027 --> 54:11.204
-PAUL: Wendell!
-[cries] Ah! Ah!

54:11.248 --> 54:13.728
No! No! No!

54:13.772 --> 54:16.383
Mom, please.

54:16.427 --> 54:19.430
Mom. Mom!

54:20.866 --> 54:24.348
-Honey,
we have great news for you.

54:24.391 --> 54:26.741
Should I tell her,
or do you want to?

54:26.785 --> 54:29.744
-Uh, you go ahead.

54:29.788 --> 54:33.313
-You passed. Yay!

54:33.357 --> 54:35.228
It was touch and go there
for a while

54:35.272 --> 54:37.709
with your attachment to me,
but you came through at the end

54:37.752 --> 54:41.147
and you really
stuck the landing.

54:41.190 --> 54:43.410
-Yeah, you sure did.

54:43.454 --> 54:44.803
I'm proud of you, Karma.

54:44.846 --> 54:46.892
-Fuck you,
you fucking psychopath.

54:46.935 --> 54:49.677
-You see?
I told you she had spirit.

54:49.721 --> 54:52.985
-Well, I mean,
you were right,

54:53.028 --> 54:56.380
but she also had
a lot of bad habits,

54:56.423 --> 55:00.775
and sometimes you have to
break somebody's spirit

55:00.819 --> 55:04.475
to get rid of bad habits,
and that's what we did, so...

55:08.696 --> 55:10.219
-So can I leave now?

55:10.263 --> 55:12.047
-Even better.

55:12.091 --> 55:13.527
You might not like
the sound of this at first,

55:13.571 --> 55:15.921
but I promise you,
it's going to be amazing.

55:17.879 --> 55:21.883
-Karma, you and I
are going to spend

55:21.927 --> 55:26.279
the rest of our lives together,
starting tonight.

55:29.108 --> 55:30.457
-What?

55:30.501 --> 55:32.720
-I mean,
there's really no higher honor.

55:32.764 --> 55:34.374
I would have offered
to do it myself,

55:34.418 --> 55:37.246
but I wouldn't be
a genetic match.

55:39.727 --> 55:41.250
-But I thought
if I survived then...

55:41.294 --> 55:43.078
-Oh, no, no.
This was never about survival.

55:43.122 --> 55:46.168
It was about getting you ready.

55:46.212 --> 55:48.693
-Ready for what?

55:48.736 --> 55:52.827
-You have to break
the spirit of the host

55:52.871 --> 55:59.094
before the new soul
enters the body.

55:59.138 --> 56:02.097
-And in your case, honey,
we had to prepare you

56:02.141 --> 56:06.798
for a level of brutality
that you were used to rejecting

56:06.841 --> 56:08.756
so you could match up
with your dad.

56:11.368 --> 56:16.111
-Mom. This makes no sense.
Please tell me you hear that.

56:16.155 --> 56:21.726
-I know it's unfamiliar. But
it's the simplest thing.

56:21.769 --> 56:23.902
You're going to be the host

56:23.945 --> 56:26.600
for the soul
of the greatest prophet

56:26.644 --> 56:29.864
the world has ever known:
your father.

56:32.867 --> 56:34.565
Congratulations.

56:39.613 --> 56:42.399
-PAUL: Wendell!
-No, no, no, no, no, no!

56:44.923 --> 56:46.490
Let me go! Let me go!

56:46.533 --> 56:49.188
[breathing heavily]

56:49.231 --> 56:52.321
Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom?

56:52.365 --> 56:53.932
-Let's get you
cleaned up, okay?

56:53.975 --> 56:56.021
Everything will
look brighter then.

56:57.631 --> 57:01.113
Shhhh.

57:01.156 --> 57:04.377
Good girl, baby girl.
Good girl.

57:04.421 --> 57:05.378
-[breathing heavily]

57:11.515 --> 57:14.779
[breathes deeply]

57:29.663 --> 57:32.797
-Oh, good. You're awake.

57:32.840 --> 57:36.583
We have a ton to get through
before nightfall.

57:36.627 --> 57:38.933
-Mom, what are you doing?
What--what's going on?

57:38.977 --> 57:41.109
-My first question
for you is,

57:41.153 --> 57:43.634
are you on your period?

57:43.677 --> 57:46.245
-Why? What is this for?

57:46.288 --> 57:47.464
-Are you menstruating,
yes or no?

57:47.507 --> 57:50.118
We need to be quick here.

57:50.162 --> 57:51.729
-No.
No, don't you remember

57:51.772 --> 57:54.775
when I took your last tampon
two weeks ago?

57:54.819 --> 57:58.431
-I do. But these are
for your father.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.825
-Why does he need to know
if I'm having my period?

58:03.915 --> 58:05.525
-I'd appreciate
if you would pee in here

58:05.569 --> 58:08.702
and let me see the toilet paper,
just to be sure.

58:12.314 --> 58:13.838
-Absolutely not.

58:16.971 --> 58:18.625
-I know this all
seems strange but, believe me,

58:18.669 --> 58:20.758
it's in your own best interest
to cooperate.

58:27.025 --> 58:30.507
-If I pee for you, will
you answer a question for me?

58:30.550 --> 58:32.291
As my mom?

58:32.334 --> 58:33.814
-Fine.

58:46.827 --> 58:50.396
-[peeing]

59:00.493 --> 59:02.016
-You're clean.

59:07.021 --> 59:08.675
-Mom?

59:08.719 --> 59:10.068
What did he have to do to you

59:10.111 --> 59:12.461
to convince
you to do this to me?

59:12.505 --> 59:13.898
-Nothing.

59:15.377 --> 59:18.337
I'd do anything for him.

59:18.380 --> 59:21.166
And it's not "to" you.
It's for you.

59:22.646 --> 59:25.562
-You wouldn't do
anything for me?

59:25.605 --> 59:28.695
-It's different.

59:28.739 --> 59:30.218
Is it possible
that you're not menstruating

59:30.262 --> 59:32.699
because you're pregnant?

59:32.743 --> 59:34.396
-I'm sorry?

59:34.440 --> 59:36.050
-Just answer the question.

59:36.094 --> 59:38.183
-Mom, you know
the answer to that.

59:38.226 --> 59:39.663
-I need to
hear you to say it.

59:41.099 --> 59:42.622
-No.

59:42.666 --> 59:46.191
It's not possible
I'm pregnant.

59:46.234 --> 59:47.235
[sniffles]

59:47.279 --> 59:48.628
-Are you a virgin?

59:51.500 --> 59:54.068
-Where were you for the
last three years of high school

59:54.112 --> 59:55.722
while I cried to you
that I couldn't get a date

59:55.766 --> 59:58.029
because everyone thought
I was weird?

1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:02.511
-I'll take that as a yes.

1:00:02.555 --> 1:00:04.818
Are you a lesbian?

1:00:04.862 --> 1:00:06.080
-What does it matter?

1:00:06.124 --> 1:00:07.473
-Yes or no?

1:00:10.084 --> 1:00:14.611
-No. I like boys,
they just don't like me.

1:00:18.876 --> 1:00:22.183
-I'll need you to submit
to a virginity test.

1:00:24.098 --> 1:00:26.927
-Are you--
are you fucking kidding me?

1:00:26.971 --> 1:00:31.192
Mom, you know
those tests are bullshit.

1:00:31.236 --> 1:00:33.542
-Your father requires it.

1:00:42.987 --> 1:00:44.858
-[sniffles]

1:00:56.174 --> 1:00:58.698
-Wendell,
would you come in here, please?

1:00:58.742 --> 1:01:00.352
I need your help with something.

1:01:02.354 --> 1:01:04.965
KARMA: No, no, no, no.

1:01:05.009 --> 1:01:07.011
Mom, no! No, Mom!

1:01:07.054 --> 1:01:10.362
No! You can't do this.

1:01:10.405 --> 1:01:12.538
Mom, this isn't you.

1:01:12.581 --> 1:01:15.367
No! No!

1:01:15.410 --> 1:01:17.891
-That plush monkey
you grew up with,

1:01:17.935 --> 1:01:23.070
who you thought you knew?
That wasn't me.

1:01:23.114 --> 1:01:24.942
I told her to you
as a bedtime story

1:01:24.985 --> 1:01:27.248
so you could fall asleep
at night.

1:01:27.292 --> 1:01:28.815
-No.

1:01:28.859 --> 1:01:31.818
-But now it's time
to wake up and grow up.

1:01:31.862 --> 1:01:32.993
-[crying] Please.

1:01:33.037 --> 1:01:35.953
-This is the real me,

1:01:35.996 --> 1:01:37.737
whether you like her or not.

-Everything looks good.

We'll give you a second.

You've had long enough.

1:02:46.414 --> 1:02:47.633
-Put these on.

1:02:49.113 --> 1:02:50.157
-No.

-Suit yourself.

1:03:07.653 --> 1:03:09.002
-How deep?
