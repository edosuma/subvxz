00:01.210 --> 00:02.780
Previously on Queen Sugar.

00:02.830 --> 00:05.708
Darla: Maybe we should
just split the time.

00:05.750 --> 00:07.741
50-50?

00:07.800 --> 00:09.756
I sold Queen Sugar
to the Landrys.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.586
Youre doing business
with the devil, Charley.

00:11.630 --> 00:14.428
I did it so we could all
live to fight another day.

00:14.470 --> 00:17.428
But this prison, if they build
it, that day will never come.

00:17.470 --> 00:22.430
I remember you said "always
fight for what you believe,
no matter who it scares."

00:22.480 --> 00:23.595
Im seeing Remy.

00:23.640 --> 00:24.800
When did that ever start?

00:24.850 --> 00:26.602
I thought it was something real,

00:26.650 --> 00:28.265
otherwise I never
would have done it.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.982
First its the story about
your daddy, now its this.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.907
[siren buzzes]

01:08.560 --> 01:10.608
Dreams never die

01:10.650 --> 01:13.392
Take flight
As the world turns

01:13.440 --> 01:15.067
Dreams never die

01:15.110 --> 01:16.737
Take flight
As the world turns

01:16.780 --> 01:18.657
Keep the colors
In the lines

01:18.700 --> 01:19.985
Take flight

01:21.410 --> 01:22.616
Dreams never die

01:28.580 --> 01:31.663
Keep the colors
In the lines

01:33.380 --> 01:35.712
Keep the colors
In the lines, take flight

01:37.720 --> 01:40.757
Regardless of what I did...

01:40.810 --> 01:43.631
regardless of the time
being spent in here...

01:45.730 --> 01:47.800
I had to get straight.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.317
For my little man.

01:52.730 --> 01:54.027
For myself.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.446
When I first got out,

01:57.490 --> 01:59.731
it wasnt easy
on the outside.

01:59.780 --> 02:01.691
I aint lying.

02:03.240 --> 02:07.028
Most mornings
I just stand there

02:07.080 --> 02:08.661
in the shower...

02:10.580 --> 02:12.081
crying.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.753
Still felt
institutionalized.

02:17.630 --> 02:18.961
[clears throat]

02:19.010 --> 02:20.079
Isolated.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.881
Felt like nobody
could see me.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.767
My family kept me straight.

02:29.060 --> 02:31.722
And I know a lot of yall
aint got that.

02:31.770 --> 02:34.068
Thats why we got
each other.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.068
And its our job to make sure
we all straight all the time.

02:39.110 --> 02:40.566
Feel me?

02:40.610 --> 02:42.407
I mean, thats why
Im here.

02:42.450 --> 02:46.159
You know one thing my daddy
gave me when he died?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.952
Purpose.

02:48.870 --> 02:50.781
Left me his land.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.660
Boy, I tell you...

02:55.000 --> 02:57.503
my hands milling that soil,

02:57.550 --> 02:59.757
harvesting them stalks...

02:59.800 --> 03:01.756
man, that gave me worth.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.679
Real work gave me life.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.597
I can sit back at night
and just...

03:09.640 --> 03:11.722
I can say I did that.

03:12.810 --> 03:14.357
Thats mine.

03:17.860 --> 03:20.988
Man, a year
and a half later,

03:21.030 --> 03:22.657
back in here with yall.

03:22.700 --> 03:23.985
[laughs]

03:24.030 --> 03:26.658
But I aint a”
my old ways, though.

03:26.700 --> 03:29.112
Running my own farm.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.740
Hiring guys like yourself.

03:32.790 --> 03:34.781
Teach them the land.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.957
Hoping they see a future
for themselves.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.877
Bigger than all this.

03:42.180 --> 03:45.672
Its life, you know
what Im saying?

03:45.720 --> 03:47.176
Freedom.

03:50.350 --> 03:52.056
Its precious, man.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.934
Here one day,
gone tomorrow.

04:01.610 --> 04:03.271
Youre worth something.

04:05.990 --> 04:07.275
Youre worth something.

04:08.870 --> 04:10.826
Youre worth something.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.628
Youre worth something.
Youre worth something.

04:14.670 --> 04:16.877
Youre worth something.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.507
Now look at yall.

04:20.550 --> 04:22.290
[chuckles]

04:22.340 --> 04:23.876
I see new beginnings.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.046
Choices.

04:28.890 --> 04:31.222
I see hope.

04:34.020 --> 04:36.227
Want to yall
get out of here...

04:38.020 --> 04:40.682
go live your life.

04:40.730 --> 04:45.019
When you find something good and
you wrap your heart around it.

04:45.070 --> 04:46.901
Dont let it go.

04:48.780 --> 04:50.281
Its all we got.

04:52.790 --> 04:55.827
I appreciate yall
hearing me out.

04:55.870 --> 04:57.918
I appreciate your time.

05:06.970 --> 05:09.131
[Kevin] What you said
was real inspiring.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.767
Hmm!

05:11.810 --> 05:13.926
And they seemed
to take it to heart.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.188
Felt good
trying to reach them.

05:18.270 --> 05:19.931
[sighs]

05:19.980 --> 05:22.983
Man, Id love to talk about what
youre already doing out there,

05:23.030 --> 05:25.772
with Emmanuel and Benny.

05:25.820 --> 05:27.651
Look, I got a friend,

05:27.700 --> 05:30.863
woman runs a re-entry program
just right outside Baton Rouge.

05:30.910 --> 05:33.572
Id love for you
to just sit down.

05:33.620 --> 05:34.826
The two of you.

05:34.870 --> 05:36.360
Some type of collaboration.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.126
I dont know, Kev.

05:38.170 --> 05:39.956
-Just got a lot going on now.
-[cell phone rings]

05:40.000 --> 05:43.083
Just barely hanging on
as it is, man.

05:43.130 --> 05:46.588
Hold on, Ive been waiting
on this phone call.

05:46.630 --> 05:47.756
Dont leave, all right?

05:47.800 --> 05:49.085
Hello?

05:50.350 --> 05:51.999
[sighs]

06:16.620 --> 06:18.167
[sighs]

06:23.170 --> 06:25.206
Been waiting
on this call.

06:27.630 --> 06:28.961
Well, I got
some good news.

06:29.010 --> 06:32.093
That was a rep
from headquarters.

06:32.140 --> 06:35.598
Your early request
just got approved.

06:39.850 --> 06:41.852
[laughs]

06:41.900 --> 06:43.606
Dont lie to me, Kev.

06:43.650 --> 06:46.562
Youre going to be a free man
in a month.

06:51.660 --> 06:52.729
[claps hands]

06:52.780 --> 06:55.032
[laughs]

07:01.080 --> 07:03.492
-I dont even...
-You earned it, brother.

07:03.540 --> 07:05.952
I dont even know
what to say right now.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.332
You earned it.

07:11.050 --> 07:13.006
Ill see you.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.766
Appreciate it, Kev.

07:16.810 --> 07:19.017
You did it.

07:26.190 --> 07:29.432
Emails have gone out,
fliers are up around town.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.902
Your mamas been
the queen of PR.

07:31.950 --> 07:34.191
We should talk about
your lineup of speakers.

07:34.240 --> 07:37.448
So Council Member
Isabel Barrera.

07:39.580 --> 07:40.865
You okay?

07:40.910 --> 07:42.070
Hmm?

07:42.120 --> 07:45.374
Sorry. Um... Isabel Barrera.

07:45.420 --> 07:47.456
-Yeah.
-Whats going on?

07:48.920 --> 07:50.217
Umm...

07:52.180 --> 07:54.080
None of my friends showed.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.676
We havent really been talking
since everything went down,

07:59.730 --> 08:04.144
but I thought at least
theyd show up to this.

08:04.190 --> 08:06.226
Its good to have your friends
in your corner,

08:06.270 --> 08:12.140
but sometimes being a leader
means walking alone.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.566
Look at all this.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.326
This is you.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.986
You did this.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.497
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:21.540 --> 08:23.360
Ready to take the lead?

08:23.420 --> 08:25.160
Want to run the schedule
down wrth everyone?

08:25.210 --> 08:27.496
-Sure.
-Okay. Go get them.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.130
Um...

08:41.180 --> 08:42.932
excuse me, everybody.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.516
-Micah!
-Hey, Blue.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.141
Um...

08:47.610 --> 08:48.895
can everybody hear me?

08:48.940 --> 08:50.066
[shushing]

08:50.110 --> 08:52.681
Yeah, okay.

08:52.740 --> 08:56.619
Okay, well, thank you all
for coming out today.

08:56.660 --> 08:59.231
I just want to go over
the schedule a little bit.

09:00.950 --> 09:04.329
Okay, were going to meet
at St. Jo Park at 8:00 am.

09:04.370 --> 09:07.203
And then were going to march
to the courthouse.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.286
Its actually
a couple blocks away

09:09.340 --> 09:11.877
from where the rallyll
take place.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.252
Uh...

09:14.300 --> 09:17.007
well have signs up--

09:17.050 --> 09:19.211
Son, you got to speak up.

09:19.260 --> 09:21.216
-We cant hear you.
-Im sorry.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.761
I was just saying
that were going to meet up

09:23.810 --> 09:25.300
at the St. Jo Park,

09:25.350 --> 09:27.898
and then were going to march
to the courthouse.

09:27.940 --> 09:30.818
-And then...
-[shushing]

09:30.860 --> 09:33.021
...um, sorry.

09:33.070 --> 09:36.562
[Otis]
Charley, what is he saying?

09:36.610 --> 09:41.024
Uh, yeah, hes saying well meet
at the St. Jo Park at 8:00 am,

09:41.080 --> 09:43.787
and then well move
to the courthouse from there.

09:43.830 --> 09:46.867
Yall want to explain these
fliers youre handing out?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.992
Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Prosper.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.123
So its actually really critical
that everyone stays on message.

09:53.170 --> 09:55.627
And the fliers
that Prosper has,

09:55.670 --> 09:57.877
theyre actually talking points
for social media,

09:57.930 --> 10:01.252
with reference to community
members and council members,

10:01.310 --> 10:05.132
you know, contrary
to the continued lies

10:05.180 --> 10:08.308
that MPTE
keeps regurgitating.

10:08.350 --> 10:12.229
We all know this jail
will ruin this community.

10:13.690 --> 10:16.648
All of this reminds me
of the old days.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.067
Us out there in our anti-Bush
T-shirts and signs.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.940
Standing on the steps
of the Union

10:21.990 --> 10:24.151
with a bullhorn about the lead
poisoning in the Mississippi.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.407
Mm. Those were the days.

10:27.870 --> 10:30.282
I talked to some colleagues
at the firm,

10:30.330 --> 10:32.286
and theyre willing
to volunteer legal services

10:32.340 --> 10:34.046
if it comes down to it.

10:34.090 --> 10:35.330
I appreciate that.

10:37.050 --> 10:40.042
Okay, so just hit me.

10:40.090 --> 10:41.921
I can take it.

10:41.970 --> 10:45.599
Its stirring,

10:45.640 --> 10:47.596
provocative,

10:47.640 --> 10:49.267
heartbreaking,

10:49.310 --> 10:52.052
and its going to mean
so much to so many people.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.350
I mean Nova, its...

10:54.900 --> 10:56.219
its your best work.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.191
No question.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.982
But with that said,

11:01.030 --> 11:03.237
this lays everything bare.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.941
I mean, does your family know?

11:04.990 --> 11:07.038
Did they give you
permission for all of this?

11:07.080 --> 11:09.867
Its _from their interviews.
InterVIews they gave wrlllngly.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.787
But, no...

11:12.830 --> 11:14.036
they havent read it.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.705
[sighs]
Girl...

11:15.750 --> 11:17.411
Everyones telling me,
write your own story,

11:17.460 --> 11:21.339
speak your truth,
raw, unflinching.

11:21.390 --> 11:24.291
This is what
I want to say.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.217
These words
are who I am,

11:27.270 --> 11:29.761
even as painful
as some were to write.

11:29.810 --> 11:31.766
Well, this is a whole lot
of truth.

11:31.810 --> 11:36.144
And its a very fine line
claiming other peoples stories.

11:36.190 --> 11:40.103
Just based off what you told me
about Vis reaction so far,

11:40.150 --> 11:42.948
if you decide
to publish this as is--

11:42.990 --> 11:45.868
People need to be having
these conversations.

11:45.910 --> 11:49.368
The black community needs to
be having these conversations.

11:49.410 --> 11:50.957
True, but this is a lot, Nova.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.911
This could be explosive.

11:55.170 --> 11:57.411
Youre playing with fire.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.763
That was James Beard-worthy.

12:09.810 --> 12:12.017
I have a few more
up my sleeve.

12:12.060 --> 12:13.266
Oh, yeah?

12:13.310 --> 12:15.358
Yeah.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.856
Thank you.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.824
Everyone at the clinics
been talking about the rally.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.781
Good. Good.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.821
Yeah, we could use
a really solid turnout.

12:30.870 --> 12:33.998
_ I volunteered for _
Councnlwoman Barreras campaign

12:34.040 --> 12:35.166
when I first
moved out here.

12:35.210 --> 12:36.871
Yeah?

12:36.920 --> 12:40.003
She_s been a_true force
for Immigration Issues.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.335
Hmm.

12:41.380 --> 12:43.621
A major advocate
for this community.

12:45.930 --> 12:47.170
[sighs]

12:47.220 --> 12:50.348
You know,
when I lived in LA...

12:52.020 --> 12:57.219
"community" wasnt a word
I fully understood.

12:58.610 --> 13:00.601
How so?

13:00.650 --> 13:03.699
My ex was
a basketball player,

13:03.740 --> 13:05.981
and I managed him
professionally.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.570
My former life.

13:10.910 --> 13:13.617
Our whole world_ sort of revolved
around hIs career.

13:15.330 --> 13:20.950
Branding and networking
and deals and money.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.409
I dont know.
I guess thats...

13:25.800 --> 13:28.382
those are the things
that we valued.

13:29.260 --> 13:30.807
So, what changed?

13:32.060 --> 13:34.346
Losing my father,
for one.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.476
[sighs]

13:40.190 --> 13:45.856
My mother would always say
love grows from humble hearts.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.907
And then shed talk your ear off
about her little Romero

13:49.950 --> 13:54.193
and make you sit through stacks
and stacks of baby photos.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.899
[both laugh]

13:57.420 --> 14:01.208
So, what would she tell me
about baby Romero?

14:01.250 --> 14:03.627
Oh, baby Romero.

14:03.670 --> 14:06.252
That I was her cerebrito.

14:06.300 --> 14:09.178
I wore these big glasses.

14:09.220 --> 14:11.040
Had braces.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.306
A lisp.

14:12.350 --> 14:14.011
And I was always
teachers pet.

14:14.060 --> 14:15.425
[laughs]

14:15.480 --> 14:18.131
-Seriously?
-Oh, yeah.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.148
And kids at school
were very cruel.

14:21.190 --> 14:23.272
Third grade,
specifically.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.436
Well, what happened
in third grade?

14:25.490 --> 14:28.903
We had to do this dance

14:28.950 --> 14:32.272
for the parents
and students.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.945
Whats the expression?

14:33.990 --> 14:35.901
Two left feet,
or something like that?

14:35.950 --> 14:37.076
Yeah.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.667
That was me.

14:38.710 --> 14:41.417
I probably had, like,
four left feet.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.166
[both laugh]

14:43.210 --> 14:47.044
So all summer, the neighborhood
kids picked on me.

14:48.380 --> 14:50.883
-Wow.
-Yeah.

14:50.930 --> 14:52.420
What was this dance?

14:52.470 --> 14:55.428
I-- I tried to block it out
forever.

14:55.470 --> 14:57.381
Come on, you got to show me
the dance.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.637
-Oh, wow.
-You got to show me the dance.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.931
-Are you serious?
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

15:01.980 --> 15:04.221
[laughs]

15:04.270 --> 15:05.771
Okay. Really?

15:05.820 --> 15:08.186
Oh, I want to see
the dance of trauma.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.947
-[both laugh]
-And scars.

15:10.990 --> 15:12.309
Okay, okay, okay.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.019
[laughs]

15:14.080 --> 15:15.980
Lets see...

15:16.040 --> 15:18.031
okay, but you have to do it
with me.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.917
Yeah?

15:20.960 --> 15:22.075
Deal.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.336
Its a deal.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.200
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.332
All right. And youre
very serious about this?

15:27.380 --> 15:30.338
Oh, I want to see
this dance of infamy.

15:30.380 --> 15:31.881
[chuckles]

15:31.930 --> 15:33.079
Okay.

15:34.220 --> 15:35.960
[hums]

15:36.010 --> 15:37.090
[laughs]

15:44.360 --> 15:46.316
-[both clap]
-Thats so good.

15:46.360 --> 15:49.067
It was...
it was two left feet.

15:49.110 --> 15:51.351
No, that was not at all.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.901
Okay, your turn.

15:52.950 --> 15:54.736
-Your turn.
-Why did I make this deal?

15:54.780 --> 15:56.828
Youre going to be fine.
Youre going to be fine.

15:56.870 --> 15:58.110
Okay.

16:01.370 --> 16:02.860
Okay, are you ready?

16:02.920 --> 16:04.626
Yeah, and its all
in the knees,

16:04.670 --> 16:06.206
so you have to make sure
that you bend.

16:06.250 --> 16:07.205
Oh, keep them loose.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.751
-Yes.
-Okay.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.665
-You got to do the music.
-I will.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.460
Okay, because I need that.
Five, six, seven...

16:12.510 --> 16:14.421
[both laugh]

16:18.100 --> 16:19.761
And then you have to...

16:19.810 --> 16:21.550
I feel like Im stepping on...
[laughing]

16:23.230 --> 16:25.186
-Oh, right.
-Yes.

16:25.230 --> 16:27.471
And the girls go like this,
with their dress.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.976
What are they,
fanning?

16:29.030 --> 16:30.236
-Are they fanning the...?
-Yes.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.770
Oh, the dresses.

16:31.820 --> 16:34.402
Theyre spinning
with their dresses.

16:34.450 --> 16:36.236
I would--
I would go like this.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.736
-[laughs]
-No eye contact.

16:37.780 --> 16:39.862
Right, okay.
Im just going to spin.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.916
Wow.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.451
Its been a while, clearly.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.206
[laughs]

16:51.260 --> 16:52.909
Clearly.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.585
Oh!

16:57.300 --> 16:58.801
What?

17:00.010 --> 17:01.921
I dont know.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.938
I just...
I love your joy.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.107
Thank you.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.487
You really showed
those neighborhood kids.

17:20.830 --> 17:24.903
You are now
a phenomenal dancer.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.029
[laughs]

17:26.080 --> 17:29.163
You... you help people
all the time.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.540
You just are
a really good human.

17:38.510 --> 17:40.466
And I would say
the same about you.

17:40.510 --> 17:42.808
The flowers still
Are blooming

17:42.850 --> 17:45.978
Then leaves will turn again

17:46.020 --> 17:50.719
But time will be
Frozen for us

17:50.770 --> 17:53.022
Ah, ah

17:54.240 --> 17:56.276
Ah, ah

17:58.030 --> 18:02.729
Time will be frozen for us

18:02.790 --> 18:05.247
Ah, ah

18:06.410 --> 18:08.537
Ah, ah

18:22.470 --> 18:27.555
Time will be frozen for us

18:32.360 --> 18:35.181
Whether theyre ready for us,
were ready for them.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.107
We will do whatever it takes

18:38.150 --> 18:41.938
to keep our families
and community together.

18:41.990 --> 18:46.609
We will not yield to MPTE
and their lies.

18:46.660 --> 18:50.494
Read our lips:
no new prisons!

18:50.540 --> 18:53.247
[crowd]
No new prisons!

18:53.290 --> 18:54.951
[applause]

18:56.760 --> 18:58.546
We may have
lost the vote,

18:58.590 --> 19:01.673
but until that first shovel
breaks ground,

19:01.720 --> 19:05.304
until that first prisoner
walks through its doors,

19:05.350 --> 19:07.056
this fight is not over.

19:07.100 --> 19:09.011
-Thats right!
-[woman] Speak that truth.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.641
[Isabel]
We stand against this,

19:10.690 --> 19:11.930
because its wrong.

19:11.980 --> 19:13.857
Its wrong now,

19:13.900 --> 19:15.640
and its wrong
for our future.

19:15.690 --> 19:19.069
And I think its time
we heard from that future.

19:19.110 --> 19:23.228
Please welcome an upstanding
young man.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.827
Micah West.

19:24.870 --> 19:26.781
[applause]

19:31.370 --> 19:32.746
Hello.

19:32.790 --> 19:34.200
Thank you.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.798
Thank you,
Councilwoman Barrera.

19:38.260 --> 19:41.127
Its an honor to speak
to all of you today.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.597
I believe there are
several reasons

19:44.640 --> 19:47.928
we need to stop this prison
from being built.

19:47.970 --> 19:49.597
Number one,

19:49.640 --> 19:52.803
research shows the benefits
MPTE promises

19:52.850 --> 19:55.102
will come to our community
are just that:

19:55.150 --> 19:58.108
empty and expensive
promises.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.390
Number two...

20:05.780 --> 20:06.986
um...

20:07.040 --> 20:09.156
-[applause]
-[laughs]

20:09.200 --> 20:10.781
[Hollywood]
You got it, you got it.

20:10.830 --> 20:12.411
-You got it.
-Come on, baby.

20:27.850 --> 20:29.761
I came here today

20:29.810 --> 20:34.179
because I wanted the folks
out there to hear us.

20:36.150 --> 20:39.859
But what we really need
is for them to feel us.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.856
To feel me.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.270
See, right now,
standing here...

20:47.870 --> 20:49.280
Im bleeding.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.618
You cant see it,
but Ive been hurt.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.666
Violated.

20:57.710 --> 21:00.417
And deep down,

21:00.460 --> 21:03.372
a part of me knows that Ill
always have to live with that.

21:05.130 --> 21:06.586
I know that now.

21:13.890 --> 21:16.768
Last year,
I was driving

21:16.810 --> 21:18.687
and a cop here
pulled me over.

21:18.730 --> 21:23.235
But instead of giving me
a ticket and letting me go,

21:23.280 --> 21:25.908
he put a gun in my mouth.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.828
Huh?

21:29.870 --> 21:31.656
Violet: I didnt know that.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.531
It was empty,
but I didnt know that

21:33.580 --> 21:37.289
until he pulled the trigger
and just laughed.

21:43.590 --> 21:46.047
You know, since then
Ive been wondering, like,

21:46.090 --> 21:47.717
why this officer felt

21:47.760 --> 21:53.300
that he could abuse me
and just walk away.

21:55.180 --> 21:57.057
And the only answer
I can think of is,

21:57.100 --> 22:02.106
this cop felt his dignity,
his life,

22:02.150 --> 22:04.061
was worth more than mine.

22:06.950 --> 22:12.570
But I wont allow my fear,

22:12.620 --> 22:17.284
my silence to protect this man
anymore.

22:19.790 --> 22:23.908
My abusers name
is Officer Randall Orson.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.212
[crowd gasps]

22:28.130 --> 22:30.542
See, the real problem
if we build this prison

22:30.600 --> 22:32.591
is it tells cops
like Randall Orson

22:32.640 --> 22:35.973
that its okay
to do what he did.

22:36.020 --> 22:39.649
The real problem is
if they build that jail,

22:39.690 --> 22:42.762
the prison,
theyre going to fill it.

22:42.820 --> 22:47.564
The real cost of the prison
isnt in dollars and cents.

22:47.610 --> 22:50.773
Okay? Prisons arent made
of bricks and mortar.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.787
And blood.

22:55.830 --> 22:57.457
If we allow this,

22:57.500 --> 23:00.788
St. Jo becomes another place
that puts hope in cages

23:00.830 --> 23:04.834
and continues to systematically
destroys the lives

23:04.880 --> 23:07.087
of black and brown people.

23:07.130 --> 23:09.428
But we can stop that.

23:09.470 --> 23:10.960
[crowd murmurs]

23:11.010 --> 23:13.092
I truly believe that we...

23:13.140 --> 23:16.052
we are the ones
weve been waiting for.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.687
[applause]

23:28.780 --> 23:31.772
You see, Im one
of the lucky ones.

23:31.820 --> 23:33.981
All right?

23:34.030 --> 23:36.157
I survived.

23:37.700 --> 23:39.076
Im here.

23:40.710 --> 23:45.738
I got a mom and a dad
that can help me.

23:48.710 --> 23:51.258
But what if I didnt
have that?

23:54.640 --> 23:56.801
Right? What happens
to me then?

24:01.190 --> 24:04.011
If they build this prison,

24:04.060 --> 24:07.018
St. Jo becomes

24:07.070 --> 24:12.155
another example of whats
wrong with America,

24:12.200 --> 24:14.020
instead of whats right.

24:14.070 --> 24:15.731
[applause]

24:27.800 --> 24:30.257
[crowd cheers]

24:33.090 --> 24:34.887
[crowd, chanting]
No new prisons!

24:34.930 --> 24:38.138
No new prisons!
No new prisons!

24:38.180 --> 24:41.058
No new prisons! No new prisons!

24:41.100 --> 24:42.761
No new prisons!

24:46.480 --> 24:48.971
Okay, this one
is over in Lutcher.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.237
Its got a nice little
covered patio.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.816
Its a good location.

24:52.860 --> 24:54.521
Looks nice.

24:54.570 --> 24:58.654
I know Im bombarding you
with all these places,

24:58.700 --> 25:02.534
but, you know, we can take
our time and get it right.

25:02.580 --> 25:04.036
Well, its...

25:04.080 --> 25:05.991
its... its great.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.951
Its really,
really great.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.877
I just am trying to, you know,
take it all in.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.581
I understand.

25:11.630 --> 25:16.636
I know the hospital
was a bit of a scare.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.591
And I appreciate you telling me.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.011
And all this, its--

25:21.060 --> 25:22.721
its a lot of change.

25:22.770 --> 25:24.089
So...

25:26.060 --> 25:28.551
I didnt expect it
to go so fast.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.146
[Jarrett]
Sure.

25:31.570 --> 25:35.392
Which is why
theres one more spot.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.566
And this one,
I dont know, it...

25:37.620 --> 25:39.520
it might make things
a little easier.

25:39.580 --> 25:42.242
Maybe feel a little more
like home.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.241
What?

25:49.290 --> 25:50.791
Wheres the listing?

25:50.840 --> 25:52.831
Youre sitting in it.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.586
What?

25:56.550 --> 25:58.006
Clive is retiring.

25:59.350 --> 26:00.635
Just put this place
on the market.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.016
Are you serious?

26:04.060 --> 26:05.937
Just a few days ago.

26:05.980 --> 26:07.686
Wow.

26:10.520 --> 26:15.731
I remember day I was hired here,
almost 20 years ago.

26:17.410 --> 26:20.902
Here I was,
this 40-something-year-old woman

26:20.950 --> 26:23.657
applying for
a waitressing job.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.996
But I was grateful
for that job.

26:28.370 --> 26:31.453
This place became
my second home.

26:33.340 --> 26:37.083
They helped me carve out a
little piece of my independence.

26:38.930 --> 26:43.549
And before long, I was making
double everybody elses tips.

26:43.600 --> 26:44.715
[laughs]

26:44.770 --> 26:46.726
I can believe that.

26:46.770 --> 26:50.342
Took another 18 years
before Clive made me manager,

26:50.400 --> 26:53.016
and I had to fight
tooth and nail for that.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.736
Well, this can all
be yours.

27:04.950 --> 27:06.611
Hmm.

27:06.660 --> 27:11.666
If St. Jo allows this
to happen,

27:11.710 --> 27:15.373
it becomes another place
that puts hope in cages

27:15.420 --> 27:18.332
and continues to systematically
destroys the lives

27:18.380 --> 27:20.678
of black and brown people.

27:20.720 --> 27:24.053
I feel like theyre still
going to build that jail.

27:25.930 --> 27:27.215
Maybe.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.846
_ But we started _
an important conversation.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.470
Look at this.

27:34.150 --> 27:37.278
Over 300,000 views
in just a few hours.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.935
Babe, this is momentum.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.026
This creates change.

27:41.070 --> 27:42.731
You did that.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.399
[sighs]

27:46.450 --> 27:48.691
All I did was tell the truth.

27:48.750 --> 27:52.379
Well, if standing up
and telling the truth was easy,

27:52.420 --> 27:54.411
everyone would do it.

27:56.630 --> 27:59.872
This kind of traction,
this cant be ignored.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.218
Trust me.

...accusations against
Officer Randall Orson

28:05.600 --> 28:07.420
More_victims
are stepping forward.

28:07.470 --> 28:08.801
As details of
the alleged assault--

28:08.850 --> 28:10.670
More victims?

28:10.730 --> 28:12.436

their support

28:16.110 --> 28:19.318

to support the fight

28:21.240 --> 28:24.903

expansion into Louisiana.

28:24.950 --> 28:26.577

there are no plans
to delay building

28:47.970 --> 28:49.460
No matter what,

28:49.520 --> 28:52.136
I couldnt be more
proud of you.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.557
You fought.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.917
Glad you came to the rally.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.417
Doing a little celebration
by the house tomorrow.

29:18.460 --> 29:21.372
Asked us to dress up
and come by.

29:23.470 --> 29:26.792
Please tell Micah_
that I say congratulations.

29:26.840 --> 29:30.173
It was a very brave thing
that he did.

29:34.600 --> 29:35.931
You...

29:35.980 --> 29:37.550
you bought him this?

29:37.610 --> 29:39.054
Yeah, I did.

29:39.110 --> 29:41.101
Apparently its something,
a very big deal,

29:41.150 --> 29:42.936
that all of his friends have.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.197
But we have to build it.

29:45.240 --> 29:51.110
Uh, well, he asked if we could
all build it together.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.902
but if it feels weird for you,
I completely understand

29:53.950 --> 29:56.248
Nah, thats...
thats fine.

29:57.710 --> 29:58.950
Id love to.

30:44.460 --> 30:46.462
Yeah. Trinh.

30:46.510 --> 30:50.389

teaching him

30:50.430 --> 30:52.921
about different kinds
of fish.

30:52.970 --> 30:56.178
And apparently she knows
a lot about fish.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.596
I mean, she works
at the plant.

30:59.810 --> 31:01.107
She real cool.

31:03.650 --> 31:06.062
Got to see whole different side
of the world with her.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.902
Its way bigger
than I thought.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.071
You know, me and her...

31:21.080 --> 31:23.128
not together no more.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.257
I told her I just had
a lot to deal with, so...

31:29.760 --> 31:31.045
Im going to see her
at work.

going to be friends.

I want Blue to see us both happy
and respectful.

However we find that.

32:07.130 --> 32:09.257
I just want you
to be okay.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.001
Im more than okay.

Im sober.

32:18.310 --> 32:19.675

32:21.520 --> 32:23.147
I mean, I have
my struggles, but...

32:23.190 --> 32:25.647
I think of Blue.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.777
I think of his joy.

32:29.820 --> 32:32.061
And I walk through it.

32:37.740 --> 32:39.150
Im proud of you.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.789
I respect how you
stay straight

32:44.830 --> 32:46.661
for our little man.

32:48.170 --> 32:50.081
Thank you for that.

32:53.010 --> 32:54.216
What are you guys doing?

32:54.260 --> 32:55.966
Just talking.

32:56.010 --> 32:57.841
Talking about you.

32:57.890 --> 33:00.051
Did you tell Pop about building
the ocean together?

33:00.100 --> 33:01.806
-Yes, I did.
-Oh, yeah, she did.

33:01.850 --> 33:04.512
Hes very excited about us
building it together.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.017
-Are you both excited?
-Im super excited.

33:07.060 --> 33:09.528
I dont know how
we gonna bUIld an ocean.

33:09.570 --> 33:12.812
I already read the instructions.
Ill be the leader.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.737
[Ralph Angel]
All right.

33:14.780 --> 33:15.906
Ill teach you.

33:15.950 --> 33:17.486
-Okay
-Dad?

33:17.530 --> 33:18.861
[Ralph Angel]
All right.

33:18.910 --> 33:20.366
[Blue]
Ill do the bottom.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.861
-You take another one.
-Okay.

33:23.910 --> 33:25.992
Maybe I should find out
what Im going to do with it.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.701
-You take this one.
-All right.

33:27.750 --> 33:28.990
And you take this one.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.122
Is that the ocean?

33:31.170 --> 33:33.468
These are like
little fish...

33:33.510 --> 33:37.048
You clearly
have MPTE on the ropes.

33:38.260 --> 33:40.842
But what I want
is an outright--

33:40.890 --> 33:42.801
Knockout punch.

33:42.850 --> 33:44.841
[laughs]

33:44.890 --> 33:46.187
Im listening.

33:46.230 --> 33:49.188
We kill two birds
with one stone.

33:49.230 --> 33:51.562
Defeat the prison plan,

33:51.610 --> 33:54.488
and take out your brother
at the same time.

33:54.530 --> 33:57.658
I like where this is going.
What can I do?

33:57.700 --> 33:59.691
Give me the books.

34:00.910 --> 34:02.616
The real ones.

34:04.250 --> 34:07.742
If another set
of books existed,

34:07.790 --> 34:10.031
they would damage Sam

34:10.090 --> 34:11.796
and the entire company.

34:11.840 --> 34:14.832
Id be hurting the very business
we want to control.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.461
Perhaps.

34:16.510 --> 34:20.549
But once_ MPTE sees that Sam
is even dirtier

34:20.600 --> 34:22.886
and in more debt
than they thought,

34:22.930 --> 34:26.013
theyll back away from
doing business with him.

34:26.060 --> 34:29.552
And so will the prison backers
in the state legislature.

34:29.610 --> 34:32.181
The whole thing will fall
like a row of dominoes.

34:32.230 --> 34:35.438
And then you can sweep in
and be the hero.

34:36.650 --> 34:38.527
Clean up the good old boys club

34:38.570 --> 34:41.653
and save your family name.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.536
Ill need to protect myself.

34:46.580 --> 34:48.662
Ensure I have
complete control.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.871
Ill need some
of your shares.

34:54.250 --> 34:56.002
Thats a major ask.

34:56.050 --> 34:57.460
Were businesswomen.

34:57.510 --> 35:00.081
Its all a major ask.

35:00.140 --> 35:02.506
What about my seat
at the table?

35:02.550 --> 35:04.768
Youll always have a seat
at my table, Charley,

35:04.810 --> 35:07.552
but youve been out
front on this prison thing.

35:07.600 --> 35:11.684
If youre involved
with leaking Sams books,

35:11.730 --> 35:14.779
itll look more like
an agenda being served

35:14.820 --> 35:16.526
instead of the truth.

35:16.570 --> 35:20.313
Which makes what the real books
reveals more...

35:22.030 --> 35:24.157
dismissible.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.071
One percent.

35:28.120 --> 35:30.281
But I want a few things
in return.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.569
Shoot

35:32.630 --> 35:33.949
First, I want
all of the farmers

35:34.000 --> 35:35.297
who were leasing with you

35:35.340 --> 35:36.705
to move back
into their homes.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.830
At favorable rates.

35:42.550 --> 35:44.882
Its not just
good business.

35:44.930 --> 35:46.557
Its great PR...

35:46.600 --> 35:49.683
which is good business
for you,

35:49.730 --> 35:51.800
as the new head
of the company.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.978
Also, I want my mill back.

35:55.020 --> 35:58.808
Queen Sugar belongs
in the Bordelon family.

35:58.860 --> 36:00.316
Itll cost you.

36:01.610 --> 36:02.907
I want more
of your shares.

36:02.950 --> 36:05.157
More than 1%, clear.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.827
Much more.

36:06.870 --> 36:08.997
Well, then youre going
to have to give up

36:09.040 --> 36:12.203
a whole hell of a lot more
than just the mill.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.882
You ready, Mr. Prosper?

36:22.930 --> 36:24.921
Yup.

36:24.970 --> 36:27.461
I can take
this last one outside.

36:27.510 --> 36:29.592
Thank you.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.380

Got everything?

36:31.440 --> 36:32.839
Yes, maam.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.970
Oh, you got the address
to Billies hotel?

36:35.020 --> 36:36.601
Got it.

36:36.650 --> 36:38.561
Yeah, she said well
settle up my affairs

36:38.610 --> 36:41.602
in a few days,
and then head back to Chicago.

36:43.860 --> 36:46.658
Get to spend more time
with the kids.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.781
Sure am going to miss
having you here with us.

36:52.660 --> 36:55.413
I really appreciate what you two
have done.

36:55.460 --> 36:59.954

for taking real good care of me.

Oh, we...
what are we doing?

something up?

38:35.890 --> 38:37.721
in St. Jo, with us.

38:37.770 --> 38:39.556
You belong
with this land.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.648
Your land.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.356
Now, Charley, I cant--

38:44.400 --> 38:45.890
Its done.

38:45.940 --> 38:47.896
I already talked
to Billie.

38:53.410 --> 38:54.786
Thank you.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.626
Youre welcome.

39:13.510 --> 39:15.808

39:17.560 --> 39:20.643

under my feet.

The real cost of the prison
isnt in dollars and cents.

39:57.270 --> 40:00.683
Okay? Prisons arent made
of bricks and mortars.

40:00.730 --> 40:02.800
Theyre made of bodies.

40:02.850 --> 40:04.977
And blood.

40:08.190 --> 40:10.146
Cant stop bringing on
The only thing I care

40:10.200 --> 40:11.986
To keep this dream of mine

How will I get there?

40:14.450 --> 40:16.406
Always kept it down
Like a handful of sin

40:16.450 --> 40:18.111
Want to make it right
Just like I can

40:18.160 --> 40:19.991

Am I worth it?

temporary setback.

46:47.800 --> 46:50.291

46:50.350 --> 46:53.808
who would stab her own brother
in the back...

46:55.600 --> 46:57.090
and watch him bleed out.

I heard about it

Dont wait, we ready!

Figured wed do something
small and simple,

51:28.660 --> 51:30.491
just with all yall
out here.

Its time, its your time.

51:34.710 --> 51:36.666

Were here on this blessed day

51:36.710 --> 51:41.465
to celebrate these two
speCIal souls

51:41.510 --> 51:43.091
as they become one.

51:43.140 --> 51:44.755
Theres nothing
that I can say

51:44.810 --> 51:47.552
that these two
cant say better.

51:48.430 --> 51:49.727
Please.

51:51.440 --> 51:53.897
Hollingsworth Desonier...

51:57.280 --> 51:58.941
I love you...

52:00.490 --> 52:03.448
from a well so deep

52:03.490 --> 52:06.618
that I could dig
a dozen years

52:06.660 --> 52:09.151
and not get
to the mystery of you.

52:12.460 --> 52:16.248
Our love just feels good.

52:17.630 --> 52:21.669
But its also a love
that deﬁes

52:21.720 --> 52:23.790
every bit of the common sense

52:23.850 --> 52:27.718
that I have spent
a lifetime learning.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.937
But here is where I want to be.

52:35.270 --> 52:37.318
You are good...

52:38.480 --> 52:39.856
kind...

52:41.490 --> 52:42.775
safe...

52:45.530 --> 52:47.657
and so perfectly flawed...

52:49.370 --> 52:55.206
that even your jagged parts
fit mine just right.

52:59.550 --> 53:01.506
On your worst day,

53:01.550 --> 53:04.292
your spirit flies so high...

53:06.300 --> 53:09.758
that it makes everything
around you better.

53:13.390 --> 53:15.642
So I commit to you.

53:17.440 --> 53:18.725
To us.

53:20.070 --> 53:21.526
And I have learned
the difference

53:21.570 --> 53:24.733
between a love
that liberates...

53:26.490 --> 53:28.196
and a love that...

53:30.240 --> 53:34.199
feels like its always
been free.

53:37.540 --> 53:39.167
I choose freedom.

53:40.340 --> 53:41.955
I choose love.

53:44.510 --> 53:46.250
I choose you.

53:53.270 --> 53:55.010

54:06.490 --> 54:08.310
You know, I aint never
tell you this,

54:08.370 --> 54:11.328
but the day I met you...

54:12.620 --> 54:13.860
I was feeling
real low.

54:15.620 --> 54:17.372
So I went fishing.

54:19.380 --> 54:22.338
When I was going
back to my truck,

54:22.380 --> 54:25.838
I tripped and fell
into some bushes.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.677
But it wasnt no bushes.

54:29.720 --> 54:34.726
No, it was a bunch
of pretty flowers.

54:35.850 --> 54:40.298
Pretty, purple African...

54:40.360 --> 54:41.429
Violets.

54:43.730 --> 54:45.436
And they made me smile.

54:47.740 --> 54:50.402
And then later that day,
I met you.

54:52.410 --> 54:54.366
Do you remember that day
at the High Yellow?

54:55.580 --> 54:57.411
I remember.

54:58.460 --> 54:59.745
You said,

54:59.790 --> 55:03.419
"Hi, my name is Violet.

55:05.260 --> 55:07.421
And how can I make you
happy today?"

-And just like that...
-[snaps fingers]

55:16.180 --> 55:18.341

been looking for

55:23.650 --> 55:26.232
since the day
that I was born.

55:29.160 --> 55:33.938
I found the woman
my soul was meant to love.

55:38.120 --> 55:42.875

in this here hard world.
