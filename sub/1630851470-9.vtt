WEBVTT

00:19.583 --> 00:22.041
What has become of you, General?

00:22.083 --> 00:26.166
Shall I brand you a traitor, a coward, or both?

00:26.208 --> 00:28.333
Keldor kidnapped and framed me.

00:28.375 --> 00:31.250
He used the stolen Kirbinite to forge weapons

00:31.291 --> 00:33.250
that will destroy Eternos.

00:33.291 --> 00:36.541
Keldor is your enemy, not me.

00:36.583 --> 00:39.958
Sounds kinda like what the prince said, don't it?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.958
The prince... is alive?

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Indeed, he is.

00:45.041 --> 00:48.166
I never should've let you stop searching for him, sir.

00:48.208 --> 00:51.666
For that crime, I will accept punishment.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.458
Release him.

00:55.916 --> 00:58.750
Why should I trust you, General?

00:58.791 --> 01:01.833
It matters not, but if we do nothing,

01:01.875 --> 01:05.458
Keldor is sure to destroy Eternos.

01:08.791 --> 01:12.541
How do we prepare for Keldor's attack, my friend?

01:12.583 --> 01:16.666
By hitting him with as much firepower as you're willing to let me use.

01:16.708 --> 01:17.875
Not an intrusion...

01:17.916 --> 01:19.458
But more of a suggestion.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.625
...might this not be a job for the He-Man?

01:22.666 --> 01:28.333
In whatever form he may take, I want my son nowhere near this.

01:28.375 --> 01:31.625
General, the Red Legion is yours to command.

01:38.958 --> 01:40.958
Time is of the essence, mage.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.708
Maybe the old Orko could do this, but I don't know that I can.

01:50.833 --> 01:54.166
You have something your namesake never did.

01:54.208 --> 01:55.583
Circuits?

01:56.458 --> 01:57.958
True heart.

02:00.708 --> 02:02.666
Now go.

02:02.708 --> 02:05.708
The Masters will need all the help they can get in the battle to come.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.875
I won't fail you!

02:09.750 --> 02:11.583
Don't do it for me.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.791
Do it for our friends.

02:15.125 --> 02:16.791
We're entering the Fright Zone.

02:18.125 --> 02:20.000
How close to target?

02:22.833 --> 02:25.708
Dangerously close, I'd say.

02:25.750 --> 02:29.208
Compared to the Havoc storm that hit Eternos, this is nothing.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.166
How is this not terrifying for you?

02:31.208 --> 02:33.458
Even Cringer's... cringing.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.416
Well, can you blame me?

02:35.458 --> 02:37.875
The Fright Zone is the land from which the Empire of Hiss spread.

02:37.916 --> 02:40.458
--The Snakes weren't beings of legend.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.458
They were an historical race of apex warriors

02:42.500 --> 02:45.833
that nearly snuffed out all early life on Eternia.

02:47.875 --> 02:49.541
That's the place.

02:51.875 --> 02:55.708
He could've been a little less on the nose with his choice of lair, however.

03:08.458 --> 03:10.041
Okay. Everybody ready?

03:10.083 --> 03:12.500
Wait! We can't do that yet.

03:12.541 --> 03:14.541
Why not?

03:14.583 --> 03:17.083
Keldor returned at the exact moment you used the sword for the first time.

03:17.125 --> 03:18.750
That can't be a coincidence.

03:18.791 --> 03:21.666
And if he was able to feel just one of us powering up...

03:21.708 --> 03:24.333
There's no way he won't feel all five of us powered up

03:24.375 --> 03:25.708
from a mile away.

03:27.041 --> 03:30.583
Except there are only four of us now.

03:30.625 --> 03:33.000
Krass doesn't know what she's missing.

03:36.166 --> 03:38.791
I have the Power!

04:23.375 --> 04:27.833
And so the hunters become the hunted.

04:29.833 --> 04:33.916
Lucky for those navits, Ram Ma'am came to play

04:33.958 --> 04:38.041
the most dangerous game of all, which is--

04:40.375 --> 04:43.458
You know what? I'm just gonna go save your friends.

04:46.291 --> 04:47.416
By the Power of--

04:47.458 --> 04:49.833
-Grayskull needs you! -

04:49.875 --> 04:51.333
Alert. Alert.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.791
Potential quarry identified.

04:53.833 --> 04:57.458
There goes the whole sneak attack thing.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.708
By the Power of Grayskull...

05:04.125 --> 05:06.958
...I have the Power!

05:17.375 --> 05:19.750
-Funny you should mention sneak attacks. -

05:19.791 --> 05:23.375
The one your friends are planning against Keldor is currently underway.

05:23.416 --> 05:25.833
Cool. Tell them I say hey.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.250
Eldress asked that I rally you to their cause.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.416
I'm busy keeping these woods safe,

05:37.458 --> 05:38.958
just like I said I would.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.583
Besides, they don't need me anyway--

05:42.625 --> 05:44.166
specifically Adam.

05:44.208 --> 05:46.041
-Quarry identified. -Oh, great.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.083
Hey, Dorko?

05:47.125 --> 05:48.666
It's Dork-O.

05:48.708 --> 05:50.083
That's what I said.

05:50.125 --> 05:52.208
How are you in a fight?

05:52.250 --> 05:54.041
I can pull a navit out of my hat.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.250
How is that useful?

05:57.291 --> 06:00.541
I never said it was useful. It's just terribly uncomfortable.

06:00.583 --> 06:03.125
Great. Try to keep up.

06:04.875 --> 06:07.291
Wah!

06:15.500 --> 06:17.125
Keep moving. We're almost there.

06:18.666 --> 06:20.708
That's what you said a hundred Battle Bones ago.

06:22.791 --> 06:23.833
Oh!

06:25.125 --> 06:26.916
Wait, where's...

06:27.958 --> 06:29.375
Duncan!

06:37.541 --> 06:38.833
You all right?

06:40.458 --> 06:43.333
I may never be all right again.

06:44.583 --> 06:46.125
So much for going unnoticed.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.791
Why does this feel worse than if they were attacking us?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.958
Don't hold back on account of me.

07:10.250 --> 07:11.875
Is that Keldor?

07:11.916 --> 07:13.583
It sounds like him.

07:13.625 --> 07:14.500
But something's--

07:14.541 --> 07:16.083
Nephew!

07:16.125 --> 07:17.791
Miss me?

07:17.833 --> 07:20.750
Why else would we have come all the way out here?

07:20.791 --> 07:25.166
I didn't catch that. Can you speak up a little bit?

07:28.833 --> 07:31.625
I have a microphone. You don't.

07:31.666 --> 07:33.000
Why--

07:33.041 --> 07:36.208
As you can see, I'm way up here,

07:36.250 --> 07:38.875
and you're way down there.

07:40.458 --> 07:44.000
Ah, curse this ancient technology!

07:46.583 --> 07:49.708
Why else would we have come all the way out here?

07:49.750 --> 07:51.958
For a fight, of course.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.875
So by all means, "power up" or whatever it is you do.

07:56.916 --> 08:01.333
One supposes there's no point in not using the Power of Grayskull now.

08:01.375 --> 08:03.833
It's certainly more direct.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.625
By the Power of Grayskull...

08:24.958 --> 08:27.958
...we have the Power!

08:30.583 --> 08:32.458
Man, that took a while.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.958
Come on.

09:00.458 --> 09:03.958
Yeah, this is definitely a trap.

09:05.541 --> 09:07.750
Proceed with caution, my comrades.

09:07.791 --> 09:11.208
Serpentine strongholds such as these were often filled with striking snakes,

09:11.250 --> 09:14.583
easily defendable narrow bridges, trap doors, and, uh,

09:14.625 --> 09:16.208
much, much more.

09:16.250 --> 09:19.583
Uh... why do you know so much about the Snake People?

09:19.625 --> 09:22.000
I've been reading the books in the archive.

09:22.041 --> 09:23.458
Hasn't anyone else?

09:24.958 --> 09:27.125
Children, shame.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.750
We can start a book club once we get home, okay?

09:29.791 --> 09:32.041
Assuming we make it back to Grayskull at all.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.583
We'll be fine.

09:33.625 --> 09:35.250
We cleaned the floor with these guys once already.

09:35.291 --> 09:36.541
We'll do it again.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.875
This was a room for rituals.

09:50.916 --> 09:54.083
Sacrifices...

09:54.125 --> 09:56.125
to be precise.

10:01.541 --> 10:05.166
Many, many sacrifices.

10:05.208 --> 10:06.500
Ooh.

10:06.541 --> 10:08.250
I don't like that.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.416
Where is his face?

10:11.458 --> 10:14.125
I think that skull is his face.

10:15.291 --> 10:17.375
Uncle Keldor?

10:17.416 --> 10:21.666
Please, call me Skeletor.

10:23.291 --> 10:24.458
Why?

10:24.500 --> 10:25.708
Why?

10:25.750 --> 10:28.666
Because--the bones, my face.

10:28.708 --> 10:31.250
I'm a living skull.

10:32.416 --> 10:35.583
Then shouldn't you be Skull-etor?

10:37.041 --> 10:38.833
We don't care what you wanna be called, Uncle.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.375
This ends now.

10:40.416 --> 10:43.833
How right you are, He-Man.

10:53.916 --> 10:55.375
Is this that creep from the woods?

10:55.416 --> 10:57.416
This is that creep from the woods.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.291
As far as associates go, Skeletor,

11:08.333 --> 11:10.083
you may want to check his references.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.291
Those skulls on R'Qazz's armor

11:12.333 --> 11:15.708
are the only recommendations I need.

11:15.750 --> 11:19.416
The rest of you, I trust, remain acquainted.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.750
How could I forget?

11:21.791 --> 11:25.541
Been looking forward to seeing you again too, whelp.

11:25.583 --> 11:28.125
That's Man-At-Arms to you.

11:28.166 --> 11:32.000
You can recruit as many maniacs to your cause as you want.

11:32.041 --> 11:33.416
It doesn't matter.

11:33.458 --> 11:36.083
We won't let you use your weapon against Eternos.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.166
He doesn't get it, Evelyn.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.291
Wait, I don't get what?

11:43.333 --> 11:46.291
We are the weapons.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.791
Through the purity of Havoc...

12:03.500 --> 12:07.541
...they have my power!

12:12.333 --> 12:14.708
The Masters' nemeses...

12:14.750 --> 12:17.458
have finally arrived.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.041
Nice trick.

13:45.083 --> 13:47.250
The best is yet to come.

13:47.291 --> 13:50.208
Evil-Lyn, send these petulant children

13:50.250 --> 13:52.333
to their rooms, won't you?

13:52.375 --> 13:55.791
Evil-Lyn? That's a little on the nose, isn't it?

13:55.833 --> 13:57.291
Nuh-uh.

13:57.333 --> 13:59.041
No words, no magic!

14:08.625 --> 14:10.083
Whoa!

14:10.958 --> 14:12.375
Guys?

14:12.416 --> 14:14.208
Hello!

14:14.250 --> 14:16.291
I don't like the look of this.

14:17.958 --> 14:22.875
So, uh, if Evelyn's Evil-Lyn, that would make you...

14:22.916 --> 14:24.583
Trap Jaw,

14:24.625 --> 14:26.875
Dark Master of weaponry.

14:26.916 --> 14:28.500
Okay.

14:28.541 --> 14:30.291
That's a mouthful.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.666
You have no idea.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.708
Whoa!

14:41.166 --> 14:44.291
Beast Man make kitty afraid?

14:44.333 --> 14:46.166
Why would I be afraid?

14:46.208 --> 14:49.541
The monster you've become is the monster I always knew you were.

14:57.625 --> 15:00.333
Guess you don't need words to do magic anymore, huh?

15:00.375 --> 15:04.250
No, but I do so love the sound of my own voice,

15:04.291 --> 15:06.583
so... lumefingo!

15:19.791 --> 15:23.625
You know, despite everything, I was sad when I thought you died.

15:23.666 --> 15:28.458
I wonder if your father will show such weakness...

15:30.458 --> 15:34.125
...when I throw your body to his feet.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.125
Leave my father out of this!

15:38.708 --> 15:40.791
Lightning Strike!

15:51.291 --> 15:53.250
Havoc Strike!

16:12.333 --> 16:15.916
Ah, this is fun, isn't it?

16:24.458 --> 16:27.541
You've become even more feral than you already were.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.166
R'Qazz was alone.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.625
Blade Wheels!

16:52.375 --> 16:56.541
Beast Man has friends wherever he goes!

17:03.458 --> 17:05.291
Necro Echo!

17:12.666 --> 17:14.041
Whoa!

17:14.083 --> 17:16.041
How many times do I have to get eaten today?

17:21.541 --> 17:23.208
Speed Build!

17:37.583 --> 17:41.875
You bit off more than you can chew this time, kid.

17:42.791 --> 17:45.416
Mecha Maw!

18:14.416 --> 18:15.750
Wings of Zoar!

18:27.291 --> 18:28.583
Shh.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.833
Wings of Horakoth!

18:43.291 --> 18:47.333
You're still the same scared little boy,

18:47.375 --> 18:49.708
looking for his purpose in life,

18:49.750 --> 18:51.625
trying to go back home,

18:51.666 --> 18:55.458
except no one really wants you, do they?

18:55.500 --> 18:58.125
Castle Grayskull is my home.

19:02.166 --> 19:05.208
I used to think I had a right to it as well.

19:05.250 --> 19:08.541
But it was only a means to an end.

19:08.583 --> 19:11.625
I thought the Power of Grayskull was the fastest way

19:11.666 --> 19:14.208
to get Randor's throne for myself.

19:14.250 --> 19:17.208
Then I embraced Havoc.

19:17.250 --> 19:20.833
The Power of Grayskull...

19:20.875 --> 19:22.791
is a lie.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.750
It's time you learned that too.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.291
No!

19:47.083 --> 19:49.958
Say goodbye to He-Man.

19:51.375 --> 19:52.791
No!

20:20.500 --> 20:22.708
Where's your keeper?

20:24.916 --> 20:26.500
What?

20:26.541 --> 20:29.916
Did your helmet just break?

20:29.958 --> 20:33.083
All of our weapons were connected to the Sword of Power.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.416
Something's happened to Adam!

20:47.625 --> 20:50.375
Adam, what happened?

20:50.416 --> 20:53.291
I lost the Power.

20:53.333 --> 20:56.291
For a change, we might not need it.

20:56.333 --> 20:59.208
Looks like your dad sent the cavalry.

20:59.250 --> 21:02.166
Good. You're up.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.500
I was hoping you could see this.

21:04.541 --> 21:07.958
Oh, General Dolos.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.583
The Legion has been upgraded

21:09.625 --> 21:13.416
to Trap Jaw and Beast Man's specifications.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.125
Your army awaits, Lord Skeletor.

21:39.333 --> 21:42.583
Give yourselves over to the Havoc below

21:42.625 --> 21:46.416
and become one of my Dark Masters.

21:46.458 --> 21:49.583
Join me in taking Eternos!

21:49.625 --> 21:51.375
Or drown.

21:51.416 --> 21:53.083
Your choice.
