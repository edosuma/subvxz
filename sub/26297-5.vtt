WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.071
ADULT ADAM: Ah,
the Halloween
couple's costume!

00:03.137 --> 00:05.773
From Alien vs. Predator
to Little Shop of Horrors,

00:05.839 --> 00:09.277
back in the day, dressing up
was always better in pairs...

00:09.343 --> 00:10.911
Well,
for everyone except Erica.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.946
Boom! This year,
you and me are going

00:13.013 --> 00:14.515
as the white-hot
hit-making duo,

00:14.582 --> 00:16.150
Daryl Hall
and John Oates!

00:16.950 --> 00:18.252
No and no.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.520
I don't get it either.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.622
In my day, there were
only two costumes,

00:21.689 --> 00:23.224
a ghost and a witch.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.892
Please, Erica!

00:24.958 --> 00:27.228
You know it's always
been my dream to go to
the Halloween dance

00:27.295 --> 00:28.596
in a bad-ass
couple's costume

00:28.662 --> 00:30.098
based on
clever wordplay!

00:30.164 --> 00:31.232
Geoff, I love you.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.301
But your dream
is beyond embarrassing.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.169
I knew you'd be resistant
and nasty,

00:35.236 --> 00:38.172
which is why I came up
with some backups so good
you can't possibly say no!

00:38.239 --> 00:39.273
Terrific!

00:39.340 --> 00:41.575
I always enjoy
a good presentation!

00:41.642 --> 00:43.277
Look, we can be
Tim Burton's best movie!

00:43.344 --> 00:45.546
Beetlejuice!
I'm the beetle.
You're the juice.

00:45.613 --> 00:46.747
Falcon Crest.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.082
Doctor. J.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.150
John. Candy.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.551
LEGO my EGGO.

00:50.618 --> 00:51.952
Corn. Dog.

00:52.019 --> 00:54.588
Or we circle back to
Daryl Hall and John Oates!

00:54.655 --> 00:55.656
Comments?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.125
What's happening
right now?

00:57.191 --> 00:58.826
Good question, Pops.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.028
Trust me, this will
make sense if you just
wear the cough drops.

01:01.095 --> 01:04.598
Geoff, listen to me.
I am not going to some corny
high-school Halloween dance.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.733
Fine!
But just so you know,

01:05.799 --> 01:07.335
I find it very hurtful
that you insist

01:07.401 --> 01:09.203
that my innovative ideas
are always embarrassing!

01:10.070 --> 01:11.339
Aah!

01:11.405 --> 01:12.940
* I'm twisted up inside

01:13.006 --> 01:16.377
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

01:19.012 --> 01:20.481
* I don't know the future

01:20.548 --> 01:24.118
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

01:24.185 --> 01:26.554
ADULT ADAM:
It was October 23rd,
1980-something,

01:26.620 --> 01:28.922
and I was ready for
a Halloween horror marathon

01:28.989 --> 01:30.458
with my girlfriend,
Jackie.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.160
Okay, so,
I narrowed it down

01:32.226 --> 01:33.861
to these
29 horror movies.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.629
I think all we need
is one.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.398
Nightmare on Elm Street.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.500
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.370
Something about Freddy Krueger
really freaks me out.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.205
It could be the face
or the claws

01:44.272 --> 01:46.106
or the whole fall-asleep-
and-you-die concept.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.342
Oh, don't worry.
I'll protect you.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.943
No. That's my job.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.545
And you know
my number-one rule...

01:51.612 --> 01:53.147
No scary movies.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.815
That's the thing,
it's not scary.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.485
Elm Street is actually
a very charming rom-com.

01:57.551 --> 02:00.120
"High school friends
are slaughtered in their sleep

02:00.188 --> 02:02.690
"by the predatory monster
of their shared nightmares"?

02:02.756 --> 02:04.692
Gah!
What's the worst
that can happen?

02:04.758 --> 02:07.861
I don't know.
Why don't you ask
Joyce Dimarco's son Anthony?

02:07.928 --> 02:09.363
He didn't sleep
for three years

02:09.430 --> 02:10.731
after watching
The Exorcist,

02:10.798 --> 02:12.166
so his body never grew.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.568
Well, now he's
a 4'7" adult man

02:14.635 --> 02:17.505
who needs a special stool
to use a sink!

02:17.571 --> 02:19.807
Mom, I've slept enough
to reach every sink!

02:19.873 --> 02:21.542
I'm old enough
to see this movie!

02:21.609 --> 02:23.677
Okay, fine.
You wanna rent a scary movie?

02:23.744 --> 02:25.446
Here.
An American Tail?

02:25.513 --> 02:26.847
It's bone chilling.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.817
It's about
a Russian-Semitic mouse
named Fievel Mousekewitz

02:29.883 --> 02:31.585
who emigrates to America.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.686
How is that scary?

02:32.753 --> 02:34.288
Well, he gets separated
from his mama.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.089
But don't worry.
He finds her again.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.591
Ohh!
I just ruined the whole thing!

02:37.658 --> 02:39.560
Well, it doesn't matter,
'cause you're gonna love it!

02:39.627 --> 02:42.696
I'm gonna get us
some cheesy snacks
for my little mouse man.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.266
Don't worry. We'll still get
to watch us some Freddy.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.400
Really

02:46.467 --> 02:48.402
I had a feeling your mom
would make us go PG,

02:48.469 --> 02:50.638
so I had my parents
rent it for us.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.273
Unless you're
too scared?

02:52.340 --> 02:53.707
Are you kidding?
It's cool.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.310
I mean, how scary can
a little claw glove be?

02:56.377 --> 02:57.911
ADAM: Oh, God!

02:57.978 --> 03:00.113
That claw is really
freaking me out, man!

03:00.180 --> 03:01.649
Tell me when the claw's
off the screen!

03:01.715 --> 03:03.651
Hey, pumpkins!
Having fun?

03:03.717 --> 03:05.419
Mmm...
Yeah, fun stuff.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.756
Dad, you've gotta see
this movie.
It's totally terrifying.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.224
That's 'cause it's
based on a true story.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.559
Wait, what?

03:11.625 --> 03:12.626
Freddy's coming for you!

03:12.693 --> 03:14.194
You can sleep
when you're dead!
What?

03:14.262 --> 03:15.796
I'm just messing with you.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.499
But the movie
is terrifying.
Have fun!

03:18.566 --> 03:20.434
ADULT ADAM: It's true.
Freddy scared me to my core.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.969
Meanwhile,
Geoff was still afraid

03:22.035 --> 03:23.737
he'd never get
his couple's costume.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.039
Please, all I'm asking for
is five measly minutes

03:26.106 --> 03:27.808
as Daryl Hall
and John Oates!

03:27.875 --> 03:30.478
For the millionth time,
I'm not going to some lame
high-school dance.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.247
But it won't be lame
because you make
everything cooler.

03:33.314 --> 03:36.884
That's why you're Halls!
It's known for its icy-cold
penetrating vapor action!

03:36.950 --> 03:38.919
I made a promise
the day I graduated

03:38.986 --> 03:40.921
to never return
to this hellhole again.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.590
Which reminds me...
Get out.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.525
Here? But this is
the auxiliary parking lot.

03:44.592 --> 03:45.659
If you wanna
bum rides off me,

03:45.726 --> 03:46.960
this is the best
you're gonna get.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.762
'Cause the last thing I need
is for someone to spot me...

03:48.829 --> 03:51.265
Well, well!
If it isn't one of
our illustrious alumni,

03:51.332 --> 03:52.833
Erica Goldberg!

03:52.900 --> 03:54.302
Hey, Mr. Glascott.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.104
Um, don't you have
your own, like,
teacher's spot or something?

03:57.170 --> 03:59.006
I do, but there's always
a student parked in it,

03:59.072 --> 04:02.643
so I park here
and then wear a pair of
comfortable walking shoes.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.177
Cool stuff, very sad,
gotta go!

04:04.244 --> 04:05.513
Oh, wait,
before you run off,

04:05.579 --> 04:07.481
do you mind coming in
and talking to the kids?

04:07.548 --> 04:09.983
It's very inspiring for them
to hear a success story

04:10.050 --> 04:11.319
from one of
our former students.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.354
I would,
but being back here
is depressing,

04:13.421 --> 04:14.722
so no way never?

04:14.788 --> 04:17.291
That's the sassafras
I remember!

04:17.358 --> 04:19.693
Come on,
we can walk together!

04:19.760 --> 04:22.696
Young minds,
look who it is!
Erica Goldberg!

04:22.763 --> 04:24.632
She's here
to tell you all about

04:24.698 --> 04:28.168
the magical
and exciting chapter
after high school!

04:28.235 --> 04:30.270
Well,
I went to college in DC...

04:30.338 --> 04:32.706
Ooh! Where the
president lives.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.443
And then I dropped out
to follow my real dream,

04:35.509 --> 04:36.810
which is being
a rock star.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.547
Intriguing. Could you expound
on the risks and rewards

04:39.613 --> 04:40.748
of leaving academia
behind?

04:40.814 --> 04:42.450
Good Lord, no!

04:42.516 --> 04:44.352
So in your experience,
would you say college
was a waste of time?

04:44.418 --> 04:46.186
I would say high school
was a waste of time.

04:46.253 --> 04:47.555
No, no, no, no, no!
I knew it!

04:47.621 --> 04:50.157
The whole American
educational system is bogus!

04:50.223 --> 04:52.726
Man, this really
turned on me!
Please just leave!

04:52.793 --> 04:55.228
You were right, Schwartz.
Coming back to school
wasn't so bad after all.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.397
Later, turds!

04:57.965 --> 04:59.733
She just ate
my new apple.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.169
ADULT ADAM: Turns out,
going back to the place
Erica used to rule

05:02.235 --> 05:04.104
was just the ego boost
she needed.

05:04.171 --> 05:07.941
Some days I just wake up
and I go, "You know what?
I'm gonna do nothing today,"

05:08.008 --> 05:09.610
and I go
right back to sleep.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.278
You're my hero.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.014
Yep, that fateful day,
she was back to being
the Queen of Cool.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.383
This bad boy
stuck again?
Mmm-hmm.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.218
Some things
never change.

05:18.285 --> 05:20.721
Wow! You're like
the Fonz but hot!

05:20.788 --> 05:22.623
Aay!
'Cause Fonzie.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.425
ADULT ADAM: That is,
until the Queen of Cool

05:24.492 --> 05:26.727
became the Master of
Just Not Leaving.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.429
'Sup!

05:28.496 --> 05:30.030
My dude!

05:30.097 --> 05:31.732
Hey, hang in there, bro!

05:31.799 --> 05:33.767
Like the bangs,
random girl!

05:33.834 --> 05:36.870
Ruben Jr.,
doin' what you do!

05:36.937 --> 05:39.773
Wait, I thought that girl
graduated?
That's 'cause she did.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.377
ADULT ADAM: While Erica was
overstaying her welcome,
I was over-caffeinating.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.112
Who's up
for Pancake Dippers?

05:45.178 --> 05:47.881
Whoa-whoa!
Take off that striped
Freddy sweater right now!

05:47.948 --> 05:50.751
Oh, dammit.
Are you strung out
on Jolt Cola again?

05:50.818 --> 05:51.985
Gimme the can.
No, no, no, no!

05:52.052 --> 05:53.120
I need my wakey juice!

05:53.186 --> 05:54.522
My God,
you look schluffy.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.457
A Mama
can always tell.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.592
What's going on
with you?
Okay, fine!

05:58.659 --> 06:01.194
I'm too exhausted
to mount a defense!

06:01.261 --> 06:03.731
I watched
Nightmare on Elm Street
at Jackie's house.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.365
What?
Where were Vinny and Lynn?

06:05.433 --> 06:06.967
They rented it for us.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.903
Knowing full well
that it's a terrifying movie
about Fredward Kroeger?

06:09.970 --> 06:12.806
Yes!
'Cause they trust Jackie
and respect her opinion

06:12.873 --> 06:15.075
'cause she's an adult
who can make
her own decisions.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.945
Sweet God!
What else happens
in this lawless house

06:18.011 --> 06:20.080
built on
the trust of children?
Nothing!

06:20.147 --> 06:22.450
Vin and Lynn
are cool and thoughtful

06:22.516 --> 06:23.984
and political
and go to protests...

06:24.051 --> 06:26.153
Whoa, whoa, wait,
they're hippies?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.621
Oh, no!
Don't mix in, too!

06:27.688 --> 06:29.089
Just go back
to napping!

06:29.156 --> 06:32.660
You never told me
that your girlfriend
comes from hippie stock!

06:32.726 --> 06:33.894
Oh, no!

06:33.961 --> 06:35.929
Great, now you got
your father all riled up.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.298
My God!
Why do you hate
hippies so much?

06:38.365 --> 06:41.969
Because back in college,
they were all off
making free love,

06:42.035 --> 06:46.707
while I was making
$2 an hour
slicing rye bread in a deli!

06:46.774 --> 06:48.809
Enough with the rye bread,
Murray. Take a walk.

06:48.876 --> 06:49.977
Yeah, yeah.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.579
Well, there go
my big plans for the day,

06:51.645 --> 06:54.114
haranguing Erica
and then Barry
if there was time.

06:54.181 --> 06:57.885
Hmm, it's all hands on deck
to get you sleeping
like a snuggle bug again.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.587
It's just a few nightmares.
I don't need your help.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.889
Tonight we're gonna start
with a relaxing bubble bath.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.857
No baths.
I'm a shower man now.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.427
After that, I'm gonna toast up
your jammies real nice
in the dryer,

07:07.495 --> 07:10.764
and then
I'll tuck you in real tight
to seal in the safeness.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.634
You do know that none of this
will actually help me.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.969
For your information,
science has proven

07:16.036 --> 07:17.905
that mamas
can love away the fear.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.206
What science
proves that?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.241
At Yale,
they scared a thousand kids.

07:21.308 --> 07:22.810
Half were given
mama love.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.545
Half were given
a placebo.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.780
Guess which kids stopped
having nightmares?

07:26.847 --> 07:28.816
None,
'cause it never happened!

07:28.882 --> 07:31.852
I could've been
a scientist.
I rest my case.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.487
'Cause I could've been
a lawyer as well.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.490
I don't care what fancy career
you gave up to raise me.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.859
I'll get over my nightmares
by myself

07:38.926 --> 07:40.060
and without a bath.

07:41.394 --> 07:45.332
Stupid loving mother
and her soothing science.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.104
Aah! Gah!

07:51.171 --> 07:52.506
Aah! No more sleep!

07:52.573 --> 07:54.241
Never ever again
will there be sleep!

07:54.307 --> 07:56.544
C'mon, losers!
Let's see some Quaker spirit

07:56.610 --> 07:58.546
and support
your girls' volleyball team!

07:58.612 --> 08:00.848
Oh, my God, I can't believe
she's back here again!

08:00.914 --> 08:02.950
Dang. Dude, I never
thought I'd see the day

08:03.016 --> 08:04.952
where you would be
embarrassed by her.

08:05.018 --> 08:08.188
Embarrassed?
No. What? C'mon.
Erica's my dream girl.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.757
And now the dream
is over

08:09.823 --> 08:12.025
and you're left
with a sad sack girlfriend

08:12.092 --> 08:13.193
stuck in
thirteenth grade.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.528
That's a thing?
Oh, yeah.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.496
See, Erica's become
one of those losers

08:16.564 --> 08:18.298
who still hangs around
after she's graduated.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.900
Get your cookies!

08:19.967 --> 08:21.602
Matt, tell me
it's gonna be okay!

08:21.669 --> 08:23.837
I usually try and find
a positive spin on things,

08:23.904 --> 08:25.405
but, um,
this one's hard.

08:25.472 --> 08:28.676
Oh, no, even eternal optimist
Matt Bradley lost hope?
What do I do?

08:28.742 --> 08:29.943
Hey, JTP!
Over here!

08:30.010 --> 08:31.511
ANDY: Oh, she sees us!
ROB: Good luck, man!

08:31.579 --> 08:32.813
ANDY: Flee!

08:32.880 --> 08:34.414
Brownie on the house
for my number-one customer.

08:34.481 --> 08:35.616
And as your number one,

08:35.683 --> 08:36.917
I feel like
it's my job to tell you

08:36.984 --> 08:38.251
that people
are calling you

08:38.318 --> 08:39.920
a lame-ass sad sack
stuck in thirteenth grade.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.555
Not me! People.

08:41.622 --> 08:42.790
What people?

08:42.856 --> 08:45.058
Wait, is it Dan?
Honestly, it's not.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.426
Oh, I am gonna make
this school year

08:46.493 --> 08:48.161
a living hell
for that goofus!

08:48.228 --> 08:50.731
No! You can't
go around school
terrorizing goofuses!

08:50.798 --> 08:52.165
You're an adult now!
It's a crime!

08:52.232 --> 08:53.333
Dan brought this on
himself!

08:53.400 --> 08:54.868
If he wants to dance,
then we'll dance!

08:54.935 --> 08:56.236
Don't dance with Dan!

08:56.303 --> 08:58.271
It's me! I'm the people
who think it!

08:58.338 --> 09:01.108
Stop covering for Dan!
I'm not!

09:01.174 --> 09:02.542
I didn't know how to tell you,

09:02.610 --> 09:05.112
but graduation usually
marks the end
of a high-school career,

09:05.178 --> 09:06.580
which seems kinda
lost on you.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.016
The only thing that's lost
is your grip on reality!

09:09.082 --> 09:10.918
I am worshipped here!

09:10.984 --> 09:12.185
Watch!

09:12.252 --> 09:13.954
Attention, adoring fans!

09:14.021 --> 09:16.990
I'm gonna be throwing
a kick-ass pre-party
for the dance!

09:17.057 --> 09:18.158
Keg's on me!

09:18.225 --> 09:19.927
Hear that?

09:19.993 --> 09:21.328
Who's in
thirteenth grade now?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.864
Thirteenth grade?

09:23.931 --> 09:27.500
Dammit, I was assured
high school stopped
at twelfth!

09:27.567 --> 09:29.436
ADULT ADAM:
Desperate to escape
my Freddy nightmares,

09:29.502 --> 09:33.306
I visited the girl of
my dreams after chugging
a case of Jolt Cola.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.442
Hey, Lynnie. Hey, Vinny.
Jackie home?

09:35.508 --> 09:38.511
Uh. She's upstairs watching
Elm Streets two through five.
Have at it.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.048
Um, I-I'm kind
of Freddy'd out.

09:41.114 --> 09:44.284
Maybe I can wait
for her in one of your
many well-lit rooms.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.986
Just gonna grab this.
You okay, big guy?

09:46.053 --> 09:47.788
Jackie said you haven't been
sleeping much lately.

09:47.855 --> 09:52.125
No, I've been getting about
seven, eight m-minutes
a night.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.127
Look, I teach kids.
It's what I do.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.764
Do you know the best way
to conquer your deepest fears?

09:56.830 --> 09:58.498
Facing your fear
head on.

09:58.565 --> 10:01.101
Here.
Fangoria magazine?

10:01.168 --> 10:02.870
They go behind-the-scenes
on all the horror movies

10:02.936 --> 10:04.537
and show you
the special effects
and the makeup,

10:04.604 --> 10:06.039
and they show you
how they make it.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.208
Not so scary
now, huh?
That's Freddy Krueger?

10:08.275 --> 10:11.144
He's just
a classically trained
actor named Robert.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.246
This is awesome!

10:13.313 --> 10:15.683
ADULT ADAM: It really was.
Thanks to Jackie's dad,
my nightmares were over...

10:15.749 --> 10:16.784
Or so I thought.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.351
Aah!

10:18.418 --> 10:20.320
Looks like my little fun-size
Snickers is awake!

10:20.387 --> 10:22.389
Mom! You know
it's not okay

10:22.455 --> 10:24.124
to stare at me
for hours as I sleep!

10:24.191 --> 10:26.026
It's hard not to admire
my handiwork.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.127
What are you
talking about?

10:27.194 --> 10:28.996
I got you
sleeping again!

10:29.062 --> 10:31.398
You know, a mother's love
really is the best medicine!

10:31.464 --> 10:34.601
To be clear, Vin and
Lynn Geary helped me,
not your creep-o stuff.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.836
I'm sorry...
Vin and Lynn what, now?

10:35.903 --> 10:37.404
You heard me.
They used Fangoria

10:37.470 --> 10:39.139
to help me face
my fears head on.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.440
Ho-no!

10:40.507 --> 10:42.609
How dare they successfully
parent my child?

10:42.676 --> 10:45.345
Murray, get in here!
Which moron did what?

10:45.412 --> 10:48.048
Just yell it to me!
It's those damn Gearys again!

10:48.115 --> 10:49.582
They mixed in
with our baby!

10:49.649 --> 10:51.885
The chutzpah!
Those stinkin' hippies!

10:51.952 --> 10:53.821
They don't follow
the rules of society!

10:53.887 --> 10:55.756
Really? You guys are
that threatened by them

10:55.823 --> 10:57.858
just 'cause they're better
parents than you in every way?

10:57.925 --> 11:01.094
Wha-a-a-a-at
did you just say?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.362
N-Not in every way!

11:02.429 --> 11:04.998
I meant most ways,
some ways! One way?

11:05.065 --> 11:06.834
Those Gearys are gonna
get a crash course

11:06.900 --> 11:09.369
in real parenting
from the Goldbergs.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.304
Oh, please stay away from
those nice, better people!

11:11.371 --> 11:13.073
Please, no. Please, no.
Please, no. Please, no.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.942
Please, no.
Gearys, we need to talk.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.610
Hey, Goldbergs!
Just bobbing for some apples.
You want a turn, Mur?

11:17.677 --> 11:21.481
Do I want communal fruit
from a hippie tub?
I'm good.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.216
Play time's over,
Gearys.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.785
Oh, you have
got some nerve.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.120
I'm sorry, what exactly
are you worked up about?

11:27.187 --> 11:28.521
We have
to do something fast.

11:28.588 --> 11:31.959
Because of you people,
my son stopped
having night terrors.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.894
You're welcome?
MURRAY: How shocking,

11:33.961 --> 11:35.062
the hippie
doesn't get it!

11:35.128 --> 11:36.396
Why does he keep
calling us hippies?

11:36.463 --> 11:38.031
Because of your
head-in-the-sand

11:38.098 --> 11:39.499
loosey-goosey
parenting style!

11:39.566 --> 11:41.434
Which is the reason
my little angel

11:41.501 --> 11:43.136
started having nightmares
to begin with!

11:43.203 --> 11:44.772
Well, maybe if he wasn't
an over-mothered

11:44.838 --> 11:46.439
bubble-wrapped
veal child,

11:46.506 --> 11:48.441
he wouldn't be
having nightmares
in the first place!

11:48.508 --> 11:49.810
Our parents are fighting!

11:49.877 --> 11:51.411
Do something!
Look!

11:51.478 --> 11:53.781
They have hay rides!
Hay makes everything better!

11:53.847 --> 11:57.584
Tell that to
Rachel Hublitz's nephew
who went on a hay ride

11:57.650 --> 11:59.820
and the open-air wagon
turned over.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.521
They had to saw him
out of the wreckage,

12:01.588 --> 12:03.824
and they accidentally
cut the poor boy in half.

12:03.891 --> 12:07.427
Now he's just a torso
and has to ride a special
medical skateboard

12:07.494 --> 12:10.297
to his job at the DMV.
No, thanks.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.166
Look, it's a corn maze!
Let's split up by family!

12:13.233 --> 12:14.902
Are you sure it's safe?
I bet your mom knows someone

12:14.968 --> 12:16.703
who was impaled
by a pointy cob.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.038
Move, move, move.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.340
I was not done
speaking to you people.
Come on, Murray.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.810
ADULT ADAM: While my parents
were on a mission
to school the Gearys,

12:22.876 --> 12:26.814
Erica's only goal
was to prove she wasn't
a lame thirteenth grader.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.149
Hello, fine purveyor
of spirits.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.852
I would like nine kegs
of your cheapest and
frothiest beer, please.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.421
Gonna need
to see some ID.
I was prepared for that.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.823
Pla-dow!

12:35.889 --> 12:37.457
This is
a freshman college ID.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.193
Which proves I'm not
some high-school bozo
off the street.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.095
It also proves
that you're not 21.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.331
Would it help if I told you
that I really need a keg
to look cool?

12:44.397 --> 12:46.299
It would not.
Would it matter if
I cried and/or begged?

12:46.366 --> 12:49.436
Still a no.
Please! I am in
a really bad place, man!

12:49.502 --> 12:51.872
The validation that
I'll get from some
random high-school kids

12:51.939 --> 12:53.340
is all that's getting me by
right now!

12:53.406 --> 12:55.308
So, please,
I gotta get a keg!

12:55.375 --> 12:57.710
I could just fill one up
with some crappy
non-alcoholic beer.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.746
Seriously, dude?
No one would stoop that low.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.114
What up, party people?

13:01.181 --> 13:02.582
Guess who got
a real keg

13:02.649 --> 13:04.885
of genuine
alcoholic beer?

13:04.952 --> 13:08.121
Look, the girl that
was getting on our nerves
finally did something cool!

13:08.188 --> 13:09.890
Okay, you have
seriously lost it!

13:09.957 --> 13:12.592
You can't bring a keg-wagon to
school just to prove me wrong!

13:12.659 --> 13:14.494
All I'm proving is
these people love me

13:14.561 --> 13:16.463
and I'm not in
the thirteenth grade.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.532
Hey, pre-party
before the dance
is at the water tower!

13:19.599 --> 13:20.600
Now cheer for me!

13:22.135 --> 13:25.038
Nothing can
touch you, Erica!
You're untouchable!

13:25.105 --> 13:27.607
Miss Goldberg,
you are in serious trouble!

13:27.674 --> 13:29.176
My office right now!

13:29.242 --> 13:30.543
STUDENTS: Ooh.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.213
Well, I no longer go here so
you can't tell me what to do.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.614
STUDENTS: Ooh!

13:34.681 --> 13:36.783
Well, I'll just
have you arrested
for criminal trespassing

13:36.850 --> 13:39.319
and providing alcohol
to minors!

13:39.386 --> 13:41.488
STUDENTS: Ooh.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.956
Please stop.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.791
VINNY: Ohh. I think
we've been here already.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.260
Well, clueless people,
clueless parents.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.329
Okay!
That's it, Beverly!

13:49.396 --> 13:51.498
You have seriously
crossed the line!

13:51.564 --> 13:52.966
Please, all I did
was question

13:53.033 --> 13:55.368
whether you should bring
another child into this world.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.971
And a hippie child no less.
Ugh, we get it!

13:58.038 --> 14:00.373
You hate hippies 'cause
you were lame in college!

14:00.440 --> 14:03.110
I worked two jobs
to get through Penn State.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.246
You don't think I wanted
to dance and wear beads?

14:06.313 --> 14:08.415
No. Can't imagine
you wanting any of that.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.750
You have no idea what
this complicated man wants!

14:10.817 --> 14:12.585
What do we do?
We gotta split 'em up!

14:12.652 --> 14:14.721
Hurry!
Goldbergs, this way!

14:14.787 --> 14:16.389
BEVERLY: And I'm sorry
if this sounds harsh,

14:16.456 --> 14:18.758
but I don't trust you people,
and frankly...

14:18.825 --> 14:20.293
I'm not comfortable
with Adam spending

14:20.360 --> 14:22.462
any more unsupervised time
at your madhouse!

14:22.529 --> 14:24.064
Tell ya what,
maybe our kids

14:24.131 --> 14:25.532
shouldn't see
each other at all!

14:25.598 --> 14:27.434
What?
Jackie Renee Geary,
get to the car!

14:27.500 --> 14:29.669
I bet it's a Volkswagen
love bus.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.939
It's a Saab,
so suck it!

14:32.005 --> 14:33.640
I can't believe you two!

14:33.706 --> 14:35.275
Look, we are
your parents,

14:35.342 --> 14:36.743
and we know what's best
for you...

14:36.809 --> 14:39.446
But you don't!
The Gearys helped me, not you!

14:39.512 --> 14:41.548
Honestly, I wish
they were my parents!

14:41.614 --> 14:42.649
You don't mean that...

14:42.715 --> 14:44.484
I've never
meant anything more.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.754
**

14:47.820 --> 14:49.222
Dead end!
Still mad!

14:49.289 --> 14:50.991
Okay, I know all this
looks super bad,

14:51.058 --> 14:53.126
but this isn't
even real beer!

14:53.193 --> 14:54.694
I'm a fraud
and I'm lame!

14:54.761 --> 14:56.596
So you'd fool
a bunch of kids

14:56.663 --> 14:58.966
with a fake keg
just to seem cool?

14:59.032 --> 15:01.568
You've sunk pret-ty low,
Ms. Goldberg.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.703
Well, whadaya know!

15:03.770 --> 15:06.239
Johnny G scored us
a keg-irino

15:06.306 --> 15:08.341
for the teacher's lounge
Halloween mixer!

15:08.408 --> 15:09.442
Oh, um, this is...

15:09.509 --> 15:11.178
And here you guys
insisted this man

15:11.244 --> 15:13.046
was nothing but
a button-down cornball.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.115
Well, shows what
you all know!

15:15.182 --> 15:19.586
Why don't we tap this
very alcoholic bad boy,
people

15:19.652 --> 15:21.054
Mr. G brought the fun.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.056
Unbelievable!
They just stole my keg!

15:23.123 --> 15:24.824
How am I supposed to impress
the seniors now?

15:24.891 --> 15:27.194
That's your takeaway here?
God, why are you
yelling at me?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.129
Because this is all
beyond embarrassing!

15:29.196 --> 15:31.498
Not just for you,
but for me, too!
Especially for me!

15:31.564 --> 15:33.800
Wait, I embarrass you?
What's that
supposed to mean?

15:33.866 --> 15:36.636
It means there's a reason
that I didn't tell anyone
that we were dating

15:36.703 --> 15:38.371
for the first three months
of our relationship.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.040
You said it's because
secrets make it hotter.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.241
Well, here's the truth.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.043
I didn't tell anyone
because I was popular

15:43.110 --> 15:44.644
and the last thing I wanted

15:44.711 --> 15:47.380
was for people to see
me with my brother's
puppy dog friend

15:47.447 --> 15:50.150
who followed me around
for a decade until I caved!

15:50.217 --> 15:51.951
Well, don't worry.
That ends now.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.888
**

16:00.327 --> 16:02.729
ADULT ADAM: After I disowned
my mom for ruining things
with Jackie,

16:02.795 --> 16:04.464
she decided to try
and reconnect with me

16:04.531 --> 16:07.500
using the thing I loved most,
movies.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.369
Adam?
Where'd you go?

16:09.436 --> 16:10.870
* One, two

16:10.937 --> 16:13.173
* Freddy's coming for you...

16:13.240 --> 16:14.541
* Three, four

16:14.607 --> 16:17.010
* You better lock your door *

16:17.077 --> 16:19.012
Excuse me. Hi, um...

16:19.079 --> 16:20.813
I lost my little baby.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.749
His name's Adam,
goes by "Schmoo."

16:23.716 --> 16:26.819
Schmoo's not here.

16:26.886 --> 16:29.056
I...take it you work here.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.857
Try again.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.593
Yeah, I don't have time
for games. I lost my son.

16:33.660 --> 16:37.530
Ooh. Bad mommy
lost her little brat.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.867
I'm sorry,
who do you think you are?

16:40.933 --> 16:42.435
Your worst nightmare.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.776
Oh...

16:49.842 --> 16:51.911
**

16:53.380 --> 16:54.414
Gotta hide.

16:54.481 --> 16:55.748
What the...

16:56.483 --> 16:57.484
My sweaters!

16:58.585 --> 17:00.953
You got good taste, lady.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.127
Whatever, I don't care
what happens to me.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.429
I'm already living
my worst nightmare.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.064
Huh?

17:11.131 --> 17:13.566
I-I thought I was doing a...
A pretty damn good job here.

17:13.633 --> 17:17.704
No, you're great
with the knifey hands
and the melting-candle face.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.106
It's just...

17:19.172 --> 17:21.274
Adam said he wished
I wasn't his mother.

17:21.341 --> 17:24.644
Oh, geez. That's an awful
thing to say. Mmm.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.745
I'm-a kill him.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.114
No.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.349
The more I think about it,
I deserved what Adam said.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.551
I was terrible
to Jackie's parents.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.486
Parents.
Who needs 'em?

17:33.553 --> 17:37.157
I never knew
any of my fathers,
and I turned out just fine.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.658
I don't see how
that applies to me,

17:38.725 --> 17:40.327
but I couldn't stand
the Gearys

17:40.393 --> 17:41.694
because of the way
they parented.

17:41.761 --> 17:45.198
But then, they were able
to help Adam, and I wasn't.

17:45.265 --> 17:49.136
Eh, this is getting way too
touchy-feely for this cowboy.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.938
it,
time to die!

17:52.004 --> 17:53.173
No.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.275
Time to get my
son back.

17:55.342 --> 17:58.811
Hey! I say the
around here, lady!

17:58.878 --> 18:00.580
Not anymore, Mr. Kroeger.

18:01.548 --> 18:02.949
Krueger! It's Krueger!

18:03.015 --> 18:04.117
Aah!

18:04.184 --> 18:05.552
Oh! What?

18:05.618 --> 18:06.786
What... What happened
with the thing?

18:06.853 --> 18:07.987
Oh, I had the worst nightmare.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.622
I got to go talk to Adam.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.023
Okay.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.092
I know you said you didn't
want to talk to me anymore,

18:13.160 --> 18:14.327
but I...
It's fine, all is forgiven!

18:14.394 --> 18:16.963
No, it's not.
I just had this
crazy awful dream,

18:17.029 --> 18:19.299
and it made me realize...
Well, live and learn!

18:19.366 --> 18:20.667
Life's a journey,
thanks for popping in!

18:20.733 --> 18:22.302
Uh. What's that?

18:22.369 --> 18:23.703
Oh, balls.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.872
That is my Halloween mask.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.039
I'm Garfield.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.141
Lasagna.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.709
Oh, balls.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.244
Oh, hi, Mrs. Goldberg!

18:31.311 --> 18:32.479
Is Adam home?

18:32.545 --> 18:33.646
Hey! It's Jackie!

18:33.713 --> 18:36.516
Crazy girl!
This is my house, not hers.

18:36.583 --> 18:37.850
Stop talking.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.118
Yeah, t-this
one's hard to spin.

18:42.655 --> 18:43.790
Trick or Treat.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.958
You can just take two
and be on your way.

18:46.025 --> 18:48.161
I don't want candy, Geoff.
I want to make this right.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.362
Why?

18:49.429 --> 18:50.997
You were very clear.
I'm an embarrassment.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.899
Look, I know I hurt you,

18:52.965 --> 18:55.935
but I was just lashing out
because I couldn't
admit the truth...

18:57.036 --> 18:58.137
I am embarrassed.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.407
Of me.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.209
Of what I've become.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.943
A loser who peaked
in high school.

19:04.010 --> 19:07.214
Maybe you think
saying all that fixes this,
but it really doesn't.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.515
I know.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.617
But I'm hoping that going
with you to that dance does.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.353
Depends.

19:13.420 --> 19:16.088
(HALL & OATES'
YOU MAKE MY DREAMS PLAYS)

19:16.155 --> 19:17.724
You ready to make
my dreams come true?

19:17.790 --> 19:19.692
No.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.994
**

19:22.061 --> 19:24.030
Darn it.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.998
* What I want, you've got

19:26.065 --> 19:28.301
* And it might
be hard to handle

19:28.368 --> 19:31.638
* But like the flame
that burns the candle

19:31.704 --> 19:34.241
* The candle feeds the flame

19:34.307 --> 19:37.944
Hi. We're here to pick up
our lying, deceitful daughter
who we stupidly trusted.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.247
Guess you were right.
We're the bad parents.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.249
Go ahead.
Rub it in our hippie faces.

19:42.315 --> 19:45.051
No, all I want to do
is apologize.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.720
Really
I was jealous.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.323
I thought you
were the better parents.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.759
But both our kids
are pretty great,

19:52.825 --> 19:57.464
so maybe there's more than one
right way to raise them.

19:57.530 --> 20:02.068
'Cause I realized as good
as we are with our own kids,
we're even better as a team.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.270
We really are.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.472
I wanted to see Arlo Guthrie.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.573
BOTH: What?

20:06.639 --> 20:08.341
Yeah. At Woodstock!

20:08.408 --> 20:11.678
But I had to work,
and all my friends got to
jam and dance and bongo.

20:11.744 --> 20:12.945
Oh. That sucks, man.
I'm sorry.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.146
Eh, whadaya gonna do?

20:14.213 --> 20:15.582
Well, Arlo's coming
to Philly next month.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.084
I could get us
some tickets maybe?

20:18.150 --> 20:19.519
Maybe.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.355
* You make my dreams come true

20:22.422 --> 20:24.924
ADULT ADAM: So often,
we're afraid of things

20:24.991 --> 20:26.959
because they're different
from what we know.

20:27.026 --> 20:31.097
But when we learn
to embrace the unfamiliar,
that's when we can truly grow,

20:31.163 --> 20:33.065
shed the old versions
of ourselves

20:33.132 --> 20:35.101
and leave our
comfort zone behind.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.136
'Cause in the end, the things
that scare us the most

20:37.203 --> 20:39.071
can bring us closer
than we ever imagined.

20:39.138 --> 20:42.174
And that's when our dreams
really do come true.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.076
* You make my dreams... *

20:48.581 --> 20:49.816
Oh, no.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.618
It's the keyboard.
It's evil!

20:51.684 --> 20:53.320
Aah!

20:54.153 --> 20:55.254
Ohh.

20:55.322 --> 20:58.090
Ohh. Oh. Bad dream.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.460
Keg's kicked, pal.
Can you spot me a ride?

21:00.527 --> 21:03.330
Oh. I guess that is
the responsible thing to do

21:03.396 --> 21:06.666
after you drank
all of these very real beers.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.435
Uh, where do you live?
Paramus.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.636
That's like two hours away!

21:09.702 --> 21:11.971
Not if we make a pit stop
in Secaucus.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.574
I got to pick up my
special protein powder
from my protein guy.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.376
You're gonna like that guy.
He is ripped.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.445
And then, we can go see
my Aunt Stephanie.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.812
You're gonna like her.
She's ripped.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.481
Okay, look.
The beer is fake.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.649
You're fine.

21:22.715 --> 21:23.916
Get home safe.
