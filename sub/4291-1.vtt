Put that shit out.

00:27.737 --> 00:31.481
The doctor prescribed me

New Line presents a real nigger movie.

Hit it again, Smokey.
Cough it up your nose.

00:50.936 --> 00:54.644
This shit is on the one.

00:54.710 --> 00:57.679
This is a done one on this one.
Yeah, buddy.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.621
You got a bong, nigger?

01:01.687 --> 01:03.892
This shit is killin' my sack.

01:03.957 --> 01:08.049
"Written by Ice Cube."
I thought that nigger was in jail.

01:08.116 --> 01:11.184
I helped write
this motherfucker too.

01:11.251 --> 01:13.261
They all did.

01:13.332 --> 01:15.437
Look at the smoke.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.613
"Directed by Steve Carr."

01:17.684 --> 01:19.920
That motherfucker
owes me some money.

01:19.988 --> 01:23.436
That's the nigger
that owes me that money, man.

01:27.508 --> 01:30.956
<i>In the movies, when you beat up
the neighborhood bully...</i>

01:31.028 --> 01:33.843
<i>you're supposed to live
happily ever after.</i>

01:33.909 --> 01:38.250
<i>But in my neighborhood,
that's when all the drama starts.</i>

01:38.324 --> 01:40.778
<i>It was a Friday I'll never forget.</i>

01:40.850 --> 01:45.194
<i>I got high for the first time.
I got shot at for the first time.</i>

01:45.267 --> 01:48.681
<i>And I finally kicked
Debo's ass for the first time.</i>

01:48.753 --> 01:51.820
<i>Debo ended up going to jail
for about four years.</i>

01:53.008 --> 01:55.016
<i>You win some. You lose some.</i>

01:55.089 --> 01:58.471
But you live.
You live to fight another day.

01:58.544 --> 02:03.364
<i>There's rumors goin' around the hood
that Debo's breaking out next Friday.</i>

02:03.439 --> 02:07.563
<i>And when he gets out,
he's supposed to come to see me.</i>

02:07.631 --> 02:11.341
<i>And today is next Friday,
and I still ain't got no job.</i>

02:11.408 --> 02:12.685
Come on!

02:18.254 --> 02:19.848
Come on!

02:26.606 --> 02:30.404
<i>Soon as my pops found out
Debo was gettin' out...</i>

02:30.476 --> 02:34.731
<i>he wanted me to move with my uncle
and little cousin in Rancho Cucamonga...</i>

02:34.797 --> 02:36.738
<i>till things calm down...</i>

02:36.813 --> 02:40.260
<i>or Debo went back to prison,
whichever comes first.</i>

02:48.812 --> 02:52.586
Craig! Off your ass and on your feet.
Ain't no time to beat your meat.

02:53.292 --> 02:54.818
All right.

02:54.891 --> 02:58.023
Be out in about 35, 45 minutes.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.156
You'll go blind, boy.

03:01.227 --> 03:03.976
Hurry up. This is Friday.
We got to hit the highway.

03:06.346 --> 03:09.161
<i>I felt like the biggest punk
around here.</i>

03:09.225 --> 03:11.135
<i>I whipped Debo's ass.</i>

03:11.209 --> 03:13.065
<i>He should be the one moving.</i>

03:34.087 --> 03:35.461
When I'm gonna ride that?

03:35.528 --> 03:37.534
- Punk, you're walkin'!
- But I'm tired.

03:56.390 --> 03:58.725
Craig! Will you come on!

03:58.790 --> 04:00.645
I don't want to hit that traffic.

04:00.709 --> 04:03.228
You had enough time
to get yourself together.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.156
I don't believe this.

04:05.222 --> 04:08.188
I told that boy to put that hose away
and cut that grass.

04:08.261 --> 04:11.228
Look at that grass.
Stanley's grass look good.

04:11.302 --> 04:15.130
Mrs. Johnson's grass look good.
But look at my grass. No!

04:15.203 --> 04:17.690
When that boy get out of my house...

04:17.765 --> 04:19.521
I'm gonna change my number.

04:19.588 --> 04:21.596
Craig! Craig!

04:21.666 --> 04:23.577
Come on out of that house!

04:23.651 --> 04:25.144
Oh, damn!

04:27.843 --> 04:29.402
Goodness gracious.

04:29.473 --> 04:31.298
What's goin' on?

04:33.602 --> 04:34.976
Man.

04:39.330 --> 04:42.429
Use that brick
to break that chain.

04:42.498 --> 04:45.793
You think it's the same brick
Craig knocked your ass out with?

04:45.858 --> 04:48.857
Get out of here, you stupid mutt!

04:57.791 --> 05:00.539
- Here I come.
- Will you bring your ass!

05:02.751 --> 05:05.947
Come on! You got me trying
to break a chain with a brick?

05:06.015 --> 05:09.463
Let's go get some pussy, Debo.
Fuck! Shit, man.

05:09.535 --> 05:13.943
Shut up! I got some unfinished business
to deal with, and your butt gonna wait.

05:14.016 --> 05:15.956
What's the matter?

05:16.031 --> 05:18.680
I fell in some mud,
and it's all your fault.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.658
- How is it my fault?
- You're taking all day.

05:20.733 --> 05:23.155
And I told you to put that hose away
and cut that grass.

05:23.230 --> 05:26.197
I didn't drop you on your head
when you were a kid.

05:26.270 --> 05:29.781
Maybe your grandmother did.
I remember the summer of'75...

05:29.852 --> 05:32.274
<i>I didn't want to leave
my neighborhood at all...</i>

05:32.349 --> 05:34.519
<i>especially my homeboy Smokey.</i>

05:34.589 --> 05:36.923
<i>But he went to rehab last month.</i>

05:36.988 --> 05:40.118
<i>And the way he smoke,
ain't no tellin' when he gettin' out.</i>

05:40.187 --> 05:41.561
<i>Gonna sure miss him.</i>

05:41.628 --> 05:43.383
I hate you, man.

05:43.452 --> 05:46.355
Here come that dog truck.
Shut your mouth.

05:46.427 --> 05:48.980
We're about to fade to black.

05:52.825 --> 05:54.103
Stop!

05:56.186 --> 05:59.535
Get your ass out the car, Craig!
This is the rematch!

05:59.610 --> 06:03.056
Think you can beat on my big brother
and get away with it?

06:03.128 --> 06:06.609
- Punch it!
- I got your butt now!

06:07.352 --> 06:09.208
Debo! Help!

06:11.448 --> 06:14.035
Fake-ass Suge Knight!

06:16.570 --> 06:19.318
I'm gonna find you
and put my foot up your ass!

06:19.384 --> 06:21.653
- Get up!
- Damn.

06:21.720 --> 06:25.232
I ain't kickin' with you no more.
I'm going to Mommy house.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.486
Did you see that? Them niggers
are like some wild dogs.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.934
That's why moving with your Uncle Elroy
and your cousin Day-Day is best.

06:34.007 --> 06:36.821
Your sister moved out.
It's time for you to move out too.

06:36.887 --> 06:40.335
It's time for your mother and I to walk
around the house naked if we want to.

06:40.407 --> 06:42.826
What? Y'all are trying
to walk around the house naked?

06:42.902 --> 06:44.940
Yes, we are.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.403
We're going to do it tonight
when I get off of work.

06:47.478 --> 06:49.485
I can't wait to see
your mama naked.

06:49.557 --> 06:51.466
That big old booty bouncin' around.

06:52.661 --> 06:55.475
High-heeled shoes on,
walking on that shag rug...

06:55.540 --> 06:57.396
givin' me a lap dance, boy.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.828
- And my johnson swingin'...
- Daddy!

06:59.893 --> 07:03.406
Ball goin' one way, johnson the other.
The ball/johnson dance.

07:03.475 --> 07:06.194
Daddy!
I don't wanna hear that.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.511
What's that smell?

07:11.890 --> 07:14.541
It must be your upper lip.
I don't smell nothin'.

07:14.611 --> 07:16.039
I do!

07:16.113 --> 07:17.970
What it smell like?

07:18.036 --> 07:20.108
Like you didn't fall in mud.

07:21.555 --> 07:24.238
Use this spray.
That's what I got this for.

07:25.331 --> 07:27.631
Too much!
What's wrong with this window?

07:27.697 --> 07:29.999
That window don't come down.
Remind me to get it fixed.

07:30.065 --> 07:31.440
Damn!

07:55.183 --> 07:56.708
Nice neighborhood, huh?

07:56.782 --> 07:58.789
It's all right.

07:58.863 --> 08:00.718
Fake-ass Brady Bunch.

08:00.783 --> 08:02.309
Eighteen years, son...

08:02.383 --> 08:05.316
I been chasin' nasty,
stinkin', dirty, filthy dogs.

08:05.389 --> 08:08.008
I been bitten by every dog
there is in the world...

08:08.078 --> 08:11.274
pit bull, boxers,
collies, Seein'-Eye dogs.

08:11.340 --> 08:12.715
What about a Chihuahua?

08:12.782 --> 08:14.471
Twice!

08:14.541 --> 08:17.605
Then there's my brother Elroy.

08:17.676 --> 08:19.914
Everybody loves Elroy...

08:19.980 --> 08:21.889
a lazy nothin'!

08:21.964 --> 08:24.747
Hit the Lotto.
I just can't understand it.

08:27.275 --> 08:30.921
- All right. You comin' in?
- Hell no, I ain't goin' in there.

08:30.989 --> 08:33.769
I don't want to see Elroy's face
or smell his stinkin' breath.

08:33.836 --> 08:36.105
It's going to be different
livin' out here.

08:36.172 --> 08:39.270
Don't let your uncle or your cousin
get you into any kind of shit.

08:39.339 --> 08:42.438
I'm grown now.
Can't nobody get me in trouble.

08:42.505 --> 08:44.198
I'm glad you said that.

08:44.267 --> 08:46.753
Since you're grown,
don't bring your ass back home.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.205
Daddy, Craig's here!

09:02.345 --> 09:04.353
- Uncle Willie.
- How you doin', Day-Day?

09:04.424 --> 09:07.685
- Where's your big-head father?
- There he is right there.

09:08.935 --> 09:10.723
Hey, Unc!

09:12.650 --> 09:14.503
I heard you're running
from an ass-whippin'.

09:14.568 --> 09:17.284
It ain't even like that.
Talk to your brother.

09:17.352 --> 09:19.840
If it had been me,
I'd have shot him.

09:19.911 --> 09:22.081
I know he'd have popped him.

09:24.710 --> 09:26.980
Hey, Willie! How's it goin'?

09:27.047 --> 09:29.861
Still steppin' in that dog shit
every day?

09:31.588 --> 09:33.314
You take care of my boy.

09:33.382 --> 09:35.236
Don't worry about nothin',
big bro.

09:35.302 --> 09:37.755
He's in the best hands
in Rancho "Choke-among-us."

09:37.828 --> 09:41.123
I'm the king here. You just
another nigger late payin' his rent.

09:41.188 --> 09:42.499
Ain't that right, nephew?

09:42.566 --> 09:44.453
- Yeah.
- Wait, Craig.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.818
- Remember what I told you.
- I'll remember.

09:46.885 --> 09:49.666
Now, Lotto stud...

09:49.732 --> 09:51.586
close my door, don't slam it.

09:53.285 --> 09:56.578
Can't even count to ten, and suddenly
you hit the Lotto. Ain't that a bitch?

09:58.562 --> 10:00.571
Send Betty my love!

10:00.642 --> 10:03.031
- Boy, you lookin' good.
- I can't call it.

10:03.106 --> 10:07.613
Give me that bag.
When you're finished with him, come in.

10:07.684 --> 10:09.275
All right. Thanks, Unc.

10:11.393 --> 10:12.768
Damn.

10:12.834 --> 10:16.218
It's been what, a year, since we
kicked it at the family reunion?

10:16.289 --> 10:17.980
It was about a year, huh?

10:18.050 --> 10:19.674
Yeah, man.

10:19.745 --> 10:22.134
Ever since you moved out here,
we lost touch.

10:22.209 --> 10:25.341
I know.
This is a long way from Watts.

10:25.410 --> 10:27.797
But the good thing
about bein' out here...

10:27.872 --> 10:30.426
we don't hear no gunshots,
no helicopters.

10:30.497 --> 10:33.879
No police, no crackheads,
no chicken heads, no nothin'.

10:33.953 --> 10:36.026
Just clean, fresh air.
Just smell.

10:36.095 --> 10:38.071
Smell good, huh?

10:38.145 --> 10:39.999
Taste good.
Taste the air.

10:40.927 --> 10:42.814
- Yeah, dude.
- Aw, man.

10:42.879 --> 10:44.788
Aw, shit!

10:49.087 --> 10:50.264
Who is that?

10:51.294 --> 10:53.148
The Joker brothers.

10:58.142 --> 11:00.411
That's Joker.
He just got out of the pen.

11:00.478 --> 11:03.291
There's Little Joker.
He just got out of Y.A.

11:03.357 --> 11:06.904
Then there's Baby Joker right there.
He just got out the juvenile center.

11:06.974 --> 11:09.623
Then they got
a little dog named Cheeco.

11:09.692 --> 11:12.026
You better watch him.
He'll bite the shit out of you.

11:12.892 --> 11:15.030
But I got something better
than that Cadillac.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.790
- What's that?
- Peep this.

11:16.859 --> 11:18.899
What?

11:18.971 --> 11:20.498
Check this out.

11:22.876 --> 11:25.526
- This you?
- A little something I picked up.

11:25.594 --> 11:27.537
- You diggin' that?
- Damn.

11:27.611 --> 11:30.872
I wish we hit the Lotto and came up
on a million dollars like y'all.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.387
After payin' taxes and lawyer fees
and all Daddy's bad-ass credit...

11:34.457 --> 11:37.307
buyin' Viagra, trickin' with
these sack chasers around here...

11:37.371 --> 11:40.469
$30, $40 now and then,
I ain't end up with a million dollars.

11:40.539 --> 11:44.466
We end up with this crib and
this bad motherfucker right here.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.063
It's off the hook.

11:46.136 --> 11:47.665
- You like that, huh?
- I do.

11:47.738 --> 11:49.647
I just got them 20's there.

11:49.722 --> 11:52.088
Them ain't 20's,
but it's off the hook.

11:52.152 --> 11:55.121
Them are 20's. No, they're tens.
I bought 'em from somebody.

11:55.193 --> 11:57.362
- But they nice, though.
- Yeah, they cool.

11:57.431 --> 11:58.806
They tight.

11:58.873 --> 12:01.621
Then since I had this,
my pussy rate went...

12:01.688 --> 12:05.583
I get more pussy from police ladies.
Everybody give me some pussy.

12:05.656 --> 12:07.597
What up, Day-Day?

12:07.672 --> 12:09.940
Oh, this lady is funny, man.

12:10.006 --> 12:12.177
She used to own a record booth
at the Slauson swap meet.

12:12.246 --> 12:14.897
She is funny as hell.
Come on.

12:14.967 --> 12:16.307
What up, Mulan?

12:16.374 --> 12:19.887
Hey, wait! Don't be steppin'
on those flowers, motherfucker.

12:19.958 --> 12:21.845
I just planted that shit.

12:23.605 --> 12:26.421
- Who's your boy?
- That's my cousin Craig from L.A.

12:26.486 --> 12:28.557
Craig, meet Miss Ho.

12:28.628 --> 12:30.157
Ho-Kym, motherfucker.

12:30.229 --> 12:32.685
Day-Day's just trying
to be a smart-ass.

12:32.758 --> 12:34.612
Nice to meet you, Craig.

12:40.244 --> 12:43.593
<i>Yo, Day-Day, something's going down
with those eses across the street.</i>

12:43.667 --> 12:46.416
Yeah, I've been seein'
a lot of activity.

12:46.482 --> 12:48.653
What kind of activity?

12:48.722 --> 12:52.302
Strange activity. I think
they're running drugs from Tijuana.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.477
- Day-Day don't believe me.
- I ain't got time.

12:54.548 --> 12:57.132
Got to go, Miss Ho.
I'm just kiddin'.

12:57.202 --> 13:00.815
Come by after work.
I got the John Blaze shit for you.

13:01.875 --> 13:03.248
Nice to meet you.

13:03.313 --> 13:05.168
- Peace out, Craig.
- Peace out.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.098
Yeah. Bye. See ya.

13:09.169 --> 13:10.926
Man.

13:10.994 --> 13:13.296
Nice hat.

13:14.417 --> 13:16.903
I told you she was funny.

13:19.056 --> 13:21.128
- Big house, ain't it?
- Yeah, it is.

13:21.200 --> 13:25.608
Yeah. Y'all wish y'all had
one like this, didn't ya?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.140
We do.

13:27.215 --> 13:30.247
Daddy! Where my shirt at?

13:30.319 --> 13:32.808
- Daddy, where my shirt?
- Which one? The pink one?

13:32.880 --> 13:36.328
You have it here.
Ran out of toilet paper, son. Sorry.

13:36.397 --> 13:38.407
- Sure was soft, though.
- You wiped your ass with my shirt?

13:38.477 --> 13:42.276
Told you not to leave your shit
in the bathroom.

13:42.351 --> 13:43.876
What you doin'?

13:43.950 --> 13:45.957
This is a nice house, man.

13:46.030 --> 13:47.557
I know. Thanks.

13:47.630 --> 13:50.477
I just wish
Mama had a chance to see it.

13:50.541 --> 13:53.770
You know she had a heart attack and died
when she found out we won the lottery.

13:53.838 --> 13:55.363
I know the story.

13:55.436 --> 13:59.048
If Mama had a chance to see this,
she'd have been so happy.

13:59.117 --> 14:00.939
But that's how things work.

14:01.005 --> 14:03.372
Well, I'm about to go to work...

14:03.438 --> 14:05.890
something you might not never
know nothin' about.

14:05.964 --> 14:08.865
- Know what I'm sayin'?
- Where you workin' at?

14:08.939 --> 14:10.696
At Pinky's Record and Disc.

14:10.762 --> 14:13.250
You can't live in this house
without a job.

14:13.322 --> 14:17.632
So try to think about that,
'cause I got me a job.

14:17.708 --> 14:20.042
Job, job, job.

14:33.864 --> 14:35.240
Damn.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.334
Suga!

14:52.678 --> 14:54.206
I'm comin'!

14:56.296 --> 14:59.807
Craig, I want you to meet
my old lady Suga.

14:59.878 --> 15:02.596
Suga, my nephew Craig.

15:05.799 --> 15:08.613
You even cuter
than your baby pictures.

15:08.679 --> 15:10.270
Thank you.

15:13.348 --> 15:15.552
We can keep it all in the family.

15:16.870 --> 15:18.723
You got a fat ass.

15:18.789 --> 15:21.408
All right, that's enough!

15:21.477 --> 15:23.167
Shit! That's enough!

15:23.237 --> 15:26.083
Go back upstairs,
and put on some damn clothes!

15:26.148 --> 15:28.604
- Go now!
- Help me out.

15:29.668 --> 15:31.423
Nice meetin' you, Craig.

15:32.516 --> 15:33.890
Nice to meet you.

15:37.732 --> 15:40.633
That woman gonna be
the death of me one day.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.520
Viagra ain't workin'.
My back keep goin' out.

15:43.586 --> 15:46.456
That freak can't get enough
from your Uncle Elroy.

15:46.531 --> 15:50.459
But check this out. Got to lay
some ground rules down on you.

15:50.531 --> 15:53.497
- You family. I love you.
- I love you, too, Unc.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.838
You welcome to anything
in my house...

15:55.906 --> 15:58.239
but don't let me catch you
in my refrigerator...

15:58.304 --> 16:00.377
or with your finger
in my sugar bowl.

16:00.449 --> 16:02.390
- You feel me knockin'?
- I feel you.

16:02.464 --> 16:04.373
Well, let me in.

16:04.448 --> 16:06.205
Who is that with Day-Day's car?

16:06.273 --> 16:08.215
That D'wana.

16:08.290 --> 16:09.750
Boy's ex.

16:09.824 --> 16:11.417
Hey, Day-Day!

16:11.490 --> 16:13.430
That crazy bitch out there again!

16:13.505 --> 16:16.318
- What's she doin' with that key?
- Damn.

16:16.384 --> 16:18.555
- Aw, shit!
- Is she writin' on it?

16:18.624 --> 16:21.176
- Scratchin' the shit out of it.
- Goddamn!

16:24.064 --> 16:26.877
What y'all just standin' there lookin'?
Do something!

16:26.943 --> 16:28.502
Huggin', just standin' there.

16:31.998 --> 16:34.583
You're supposed to be
1,000 feet away from my house!

16:34.653 --> 16:38.068
Nigger, you can't quit me.
I'm pregnant with your baby.

16:38.141 --> 16:40.378
That ain't my baby.

16:40.445 --> 16:42.299
That's my baby right there.

16:42.365 --> 16:43.795
Aw, man!

16:43.870 --> 16:47.064
You keyed my...
Bitch, you keyed my...

16:47.132 --> 16:49.620
I got your bitch right here.

16:49.692 --> 16:50.837
Yeah, nigger.

16:50.909 --> 16:53.013
Daddy, she sprayed me!

16:53.085 --> 16:55.571
Shut up, you punk!
Don't nobody quit me.

16:55.643 --> 16:57.913
Wait till I tell Baby D.
She gonna fuck you up!

16:57.979 --> 17:01.807
- She sprayed the player!
- Better watch your back!

17:01.883 --> 17:05.907
Be still. Boy, look like you got
a fatal attraction on your hands.

17:05.979 --> 17:08.465
I had two or three of 'em
in my day.

17:09.561 --> 17:13.872
Craig, I hope you can handle your women
better than this fool can.

17:13.946 --> 17:17.622
- That's too much water.
- Nah, it ain't. Take 20 minutes.

17:17.689 --> 17:20.753
I've been pepper-sprayed nine times.
Take 20 minutes.

17:20.825 --> 17:24.404
You got 19 to go.
Let me show you the backyard.

17:24.473 --> 17:27.375
It's bigger than y'all's backyard.

17:27.450 --> 17:30.416
Call the police and tell them
to get me another restraining order.

17:30.489 --> 17:34.165
Yeah, you gotta have a little money
to live out here.

17:34.232 --> 17:35.607
Oh, yeah?

17:35.672 --> 17:37.526
I know what you're thinkin'.

17:37.592 --> 17:40.886
I was the one back in the day always
talkin' about how I love the hood...

17:40.952 --> 17:42.325
I love the ghetto.

17:42.391 --> 17:45.359
I was the one sayin' I wasn't the kind
of nigger to run to the suburbs.

17:45.430 --> 17:47.535
You're right, that's what I said.

17:47.606 --> 17:51.021
But soon as I got my check,
I was gone!

17:51.094 --> 17:54.707
Paid $230,000 cash on this place.

17:54.776 --> 17:57.523
- You paid cash for this?
- Cash money!

17:57.590 --> 18:00.076
Don't try to stick me
with some 30-year payment plan.

18:00.149 --> 18:01.523
That's for suckers.

18:01.589 --> 18:04.938
Got my daddy like that
years ago on a Cadillac.

18:05.014 --> 18:08.144
I got the only house
on the block paid for.

18:08.214 --> 18:10.863
That's why I'm the king around here!

18:11.892 --> 18:13.519
You're the king, Unc.

18:13.588 --> 18:15.532
How you like that pool?

18:19.922 --> 18:23.151
- Big, ain't it?
- Yeah, it's cool.

18:23.219 --> 18:25.554
But where the water at?

18:25.620 --> 18:27.376
Don't need no water.

18:27.442 --> 18:29.930
Ain't no pools in the projects.

18:30.004 --> 18:32.490
None of us swim.

18:32.561 --> 18:34.634
- So y'all never use it?
- Never.

18:34.707 --> 18:37.128
But the Jacuzzi,
that's something else.

18:37.203 --> 18:41.293
Me and my Suga
get real nasty in there.

18:44.467 --> 18:46.637
Guess I left that in there.

18:48.882 --> 18:51.053
You welcome to use it
anytime you want.

18:51.119 --> 18:54.469
Shit, you my brother's boy!

18:54.543 --> 18:57.893
That's all right, Unc.
I can't swim neither.

18:57.968 --> 19:00.303
No? Good.

19:00.369 --> 19:02.636
I won't have to clean up
behind you then.

19:02.704 --> 19:05.038
Come on.
Let me show you something else.

19:13.999 --> 19:15.492
Man, you straight?

19:16.623 --> 19:19.786
No, I ain't straight.
My eyes still red?

19:19.854 --> 19:21.229
A little bit.

19:21.295 --> 19:24.197
- A little bit?
- She fucked you up.

19:24.271 --> 19:26.757
Can't taste nothin'.
My tongue is numb.

19:26.829 --> 19:29.992
Why'd y'all let her do this shit?

19:30.061 --> 19:32.067
It's your girl.

19:32.141 --> 19:35.654
What's up with her, man?
She mean as hell.

19:35.724 --> 19:38.539
I met D'wana
about three months ago.

19:38.605 --> 19:42.118
She had a pudge on her stomach,
but I ain't pay no attention to it.

19:42.187 --> 19:45.732
I thought it came from drinkin' 40's
'cause she had beer on her breath.

19:45.803 --> 19:49.000
Turns out she's six months pregnant.
Told me I'm the baby's daddy.

19:49.068 --> 19:51.272
- What?
- Yeah.

19:52.586 --> 19:56.775
How you gonna be the baby's daddy?
You know she's lyin'.

19:56.841 --> 20:00.258
I broke up with D'wana
two Fridays ago.

20:00.331 --> 20:04.421
I got a restraining order on her,
and she don't care about that.

20:04.489 --> 20:06.628
- What?
- She got me fuckin' up.

20:06.698 --> 20:10.014
I broke up with her two months ago,
two Fridays ago...

20:10.090 --> 20:14.561
and she don't care about
no restraining order or nothin'.

20:14.632 --> 20:17.927
- You all right with them pants?
- Get out of my business.

20:17.992 --> 20:21.189
How you gonna have
a restraining order on your girl?

20:21.256 --> 20:24.387
What's up with y'all?
Where'd you meet her?

20:24.456 --> 20:26.692
I was on my way to the 'hood
to buy them 20's.

20:27.912 --> 20:31.392
I mean, them tens.
They're tens, but I keep 'em clean.

20:31.463 --> 20:34.561
I was on my way,
and she had a burger in her hand.

20:34.631 --> 20:37.349
I wanted a piece of it,
and I stopped.

20:37.413 --> 20:40.960
We got to rappin'.
It was the worst day of my life!

20:41.030 --> 20:42.460
Damn.

20:43.749 --> 20:45.755
Psycho, huh?

20:45.829 --> 20:48.317
She must be worse
than Left Eye from TLC.

20:48.390 --> 20:51.424
But this fat bitch ain't burnin'.
That ain't the cold part.

20:51.493 --> 20:53.381
She got a sister named Baby D.

20:53.445 --> 20:55.617
This fat bitch get physical.

20:55.685 --> 20:58.750
She sells dope, do hair and baby-sit
out of the same house.

20:58.820 --> 21:00.926
The police don't know
when to go in.

21:00.997 --> 21:03.266
I got a restraining order
on her too.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.601
You got a restraining order
on a little girl named Baby D?

21:05.668 --> 21:07.294
You don't know Baby D.

21:07.364 --> 21:09.502
That's why you're lookin' at me,
'cause you don't know Baby D.

21:09.572 --> 21:13.945
Her fat ass be snoring,
won't even be asleep, just standing.

21:16.419 --> 21:17.946
Little cupcakes and shit...

21:18.017 --> 21:21.149
This bitch know about all the new snacks
before they even hit the street.

21:21.219 --> 21:22.910
All the bootleg snacks.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.637
Year 2000 snacks.

21:24.706 --> 21:29.442
Gonna tell me about a new Twinkie
comin' out next month.

21:29.504 --> 21:31.230
It's a bad motherfucker.

21:31.298 --> 21:35.803
When you bite into a cream-filled,
it shoot all over your mouth.

21:37.185 --> 21:39.673
I'm getting ready to go to work.

21:40.801 --> 21:43.835
'Cause I'm a player.
I don't have to deal with this shit.

21:43.905 --> 21:46.719
You got your shirt on backwards.

21:46.784 --> 21:48.159
Players fuck up.

21:48.225 --> 21:50.111
Snatch that shit off your head.

21:50.177 --> 21:52.031
Don't worry about what I'm doin'!

21:52.097 --> 21:54.998
Why didn't y'all do nothin'
when that fat bitch jumped on me?

21:55.072 --> 21:58.845
Y'all a trip.
I'm running away from here.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.917
- We gotta pull over.
- Be quiet!

22:00.990 --> 22:03.958
- Fuckin' nuts is hurtin'.
- We got some business to take care of.

22:04.030 --> 22:05.405
Shit! Mommy!

22:05.470 --> 22:08.219
Keep your mind on the business, man!

22:08.285 --> 22:10.424
I'm gonna kick Craig's butt.

22:12.509 --> 22:14.648
Where we goin' anyway, man?

22:17.501 --> 22:18.995
Damn, Debo.

22:19.070 --> 22:21.718
Fuckin' ass is hurtin'.
What we doin' here anyway?

22:21.788 --> 22:24.692
Close your mouth, I'll tell you.
This is how the plan goes.

22:24.763 --> 22:28.561
Call over there and say you have
an urgent message for Mr. William Jones.

22:28.637 --> 22:30.009
What urgent message?

22:30.075 --> 22:33.589
The message is: "Drop everything.
Craig's in trouble. Come quick."

22:33.661 --> 22:37.042
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- Just do it!

22:37.117 --> 22:39.701
- I don't know the number.
- It's on the building.

22:39.770 --> 22:41.712
Just pick the phone up.

22:45.436 --> 22:47.125
I feel five pounds lighter.

22:48.314 --> 22:51.478
What? Jealous?

22:51.546 --> 22:52.919
What's that?

22:55.739 --> 22:58.192
Come on! Where's my burrito?

22:58.265 --> 23:01.647
What's wrong with you?
What kind of place is this?

23:01.721 --> 23:03.575
Come on!
Give me my stuff!

23:03.641 --> 23:07.469
Hello? I got an urgent message
for a nigger named Mr. Willie...

23:07.544 --> 23:09.071
<i>- Willie who?
- It's William, fool!</i>

23:09.145 --> 23:12.407
I got an urgent message
for Mr. William Jones.

23:12.472 --> 23:15.057
Yeah. The urgent message is:

23:15.127 --> 23:17.714
"Drop everything.
Craig's in trouble. Come quick."

23:17.785 --> 23:19.889
<i>- Craig who? Who's this?
- Man, nigger!</i>

23:19.959 --> 23:22.928
Just tell him
he can call on Tyrone.

23:24.278 --> 23:28.402
Tell him it's a friend of the family's.
When you gonna stop hittin' me?

23:28.470 --> 23:31.765
I'm gonna bust your ass like Craig did,
knock your eyes straight.

23:33.717 --> 23:35.986
- Hot sauce, please.
- Just a second.

23:36.054 --> 23:37.744
Hot sauce, thank you.

23:37.813 --> 23:40.235
Someone just called to say
Craig's in trouble.

23:40.309 --> 23:42.284
- What?
- Craig's in trouble. I don't know.

23:42.357 --> 23:45.673
What? Oh, man!
Hold on, Craig. I'm comin'.

23:45.749 --> 23:48.564
- Give me my money. Come on.
- Just a second, man.

23:48.629 --> 23:51.498
Come on, Taco Jim.
Give me my money.

23:51.572 --> 23:54.060
Come on, man.
Give me my money.

23:54.132 --> 23:55.986
Get the fuck outta here.

23:57.491 --> 23:59.435
This is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever seen.

23:59.509 --> 24:01.264
What you doin' out of the truck?

24:03.891 --> 24:05.897
What the hell's
happening around here?

24:10.259 --> 24:12.145
- Kiss my ass.
- Don't take my hot sauce.

24:15.634 --> 24:17.389
This ain't bad, right?

24:17.456 --> 24:19.019
Yeah, it is.

24:19.091 --> 24:23.660
That scratch make it real ugly,
make you not even want to drive it.

24:31.697 --> 24:34.796
Damn! Who is that?

24:34.865 --> 24:36.620
Who?

24:36.688 --> 24:38.063
That's their sister.

24:45.454 --> 24:46.883
Damn. You know what?

24:46.959 --> 24:49.448
I'm beginning to like
Rancho Cucamonga.

24:49.521 --> 24:50.981
- Well, don't like it.
- Why not?

24:51.054 --> 24:53.608
We need to improve on
black and brown relations.

24:53.679 --> 24:56.973
Because there's been tension between us
and them since they got out the pen.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.591
I am trying to keep it peaceful
around here.

24:59.663 --> 25:02.149
I'm tryin' to have none
of that gangsta-thug stuff.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.610
We livin' good,
eatin' shrimps and steak.

25:04.686 --> 25:06.627
What you... Don't do...

25:06.701 --> 25:09.255
I'm tellin' you,
don't mess with her.

25:09.326 --> 25:11.747
Slow down.
Damn, you walk fast.

25:12.716 --> 25:15.051
- I'm Craig. What's your name?
- Karla.

25:15.116 --> 25:18.411
Craig and Karla.
That sounds good together, huh?

25:18.476 --> 25:20.133
Yeah, kind of.

25:20.203 --> 25:22.178
She's a sack chaser, man!

25:22.252 --> 25:25.066
I tried to hit it.
She wouldn't give me none.

25:25.131 --> 25:26.987
I bet you don't get none.

25:27.052 --> 25:29.768
I bet you don't get it.
I hope you don't get it.

25:30.892 --> 25:33.673
- Where you goin'?
- To the Cucamonga Shopping Center.

25:33.739 --> 25:36.705
- Let it go, man!
- I told you.

25:36.777 --> 25:38.535
Whites in hot and colors in cold.

25:38.601 --> 25:41.023
Gonna ruin my Dickies!

25:42.379 --> 25:45.640
Hold this! What the fuck?

25:45.707 --> 25:48.225
You got a sexy voice.
Say something in Spanish.

25:57.993 --> 26:00.065
I think Karla's got jungle fever!

26:00.136 --> 26:01.596
You want a ride?

26:03.113 --> 26:04.322
I don't know.

26:04.393 --> 26:08.101
Fuck that. Hey, Cheeco!
It's lunchtime!

26:08.167 --> 26:10.948
- We're gonna get you a ride.
- Run! Run!

26:11.015 --> 26:12.225
What?

26:12.294 --> 26:13.222
Cheeco! Run!

26:13.287 --> 26:15.042
- Shit!
- Cheeco, no!

26:15.111 --> 26:17.500
Get that fucker!
You know you like dark meat!

26:17.574 --> 26:20.323
<i>Those mayates are fast,
like they're sponsored by Nike.</i>

26:20.389 --> 26:22.625
Black man can jump.

26:22.694 --> 26:25.445
Joker, get your dog!
This is bullshit!

26:25.510 --> 26:27.486
Joker, call your dog!

26:28.709 --> 26:32.539
Man, get off of my car!
Get off of my shit!

26:33.796 --> 26:35.935
- I got something for him.
- Get him!

26:36.004 --> 26:38.143
Get his ass. Yeah.
Fuck this!

26:38.212 --> 26:41.527
I can't believe
he did that to our dog.

26:41.604 --> 26:45.564
You Uncle Willie's son.
You don't play that shit.

26:45.636 --> 26:49.693
Cruelty to animals!
Cruelty to animals!

26:49.763 --> 26:51.737
Cheeco, get your ass over here!

26:53.251 --> 26:56.120
That's wrong.
He did nothing to you.

26:58.882 --> 27:00.671
Get down. Get down.

27:01.827 --> 27:03.353
- Sorry.
- Come on.

27:03.425 --> 27:05.214
Look at my roof.

27:07.458 --> 27:08.920
You play too much.

27:08.994 --> 27:12.855
If I get in trouble with them...
I got to live here! You don't!

27:12.929 --> 27:15.579
You gonna get me in trouble!

27:15.649 --> 27:18.070
Get out of the way!
Move! Just move!

27:19.457 --> 27:21.366
Shit!

27:21.441 --> 27:24.254
I was just trying to...

27:24.320 --> 27:27.135
I was just trying to help
your scary ass.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.096
You fuckin' hit my dog!

27:32.158 --> 27:34.548
You're fucked up now!

27:34.623 --> 27:37.656
You fucked him up for life!
He's scarred!

27:38.942 --> 27:41.364
We'll get you back!

27:41.439 --> 27:42.812
Fucker.

27:44.478 --> 27:47.794
Nephew, you got perfect timing.

27:47.870 --> 27:51.992
About to start a little puff-puff give
in this motherfucker.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.917
Are you down?

27:53.983 --> 27:56.151
Why don't you sit
next to your auntie.

28:08.413 --> 28:11.226
I know you smoke
a little weed, right?

28:11.292 --> 28:14.838
- Why you say that?
- 'Cause your lip's turning black.

28:19.037 --> 28:20.891
Would you like some wine, baby?

28:20.955 --> 28:23.127
No, thank you.

28:23.195 --> 28:26.260
Well, how about a little cognac?

28:26.331 --> 28:29.014
No. It's kind of early.

28:29.082 --> 28:32.530
Shit, I can roll a blunt
better than them bitches in Havana.

28:33.627 --> 28:36.592
I know Willie don't let you smoke
in his house...

28:36.666 --> 28:38.902
but I'm your Uncle Elroy!

28:38.968 --> 28:41.555
I don't give a damn
how high you get in mine...

28:41.626 --> 28:44.975
as long as you let me hit it.

28:45.050 --> 28:46.575
Look at that.

28:46.648 --> 28:48.720
Fire that shit up, boy.

28:48.793 --> 28:51.858
I'm about to show y'all
who the real Puff Daddy is!

29:05.751 --> 29:06.961
Unc.

29:11.702 --> 29:13.077
Baby?

29:20.949 --> 29:22.891
It's the Bombay!

29:43.602 --> 29:46.124
Think they really went to the moon?

29:46.195 --> 29:48.779
They say they went to the moon.

29:48.850 --> 29:51.437
There ain't no gravity out there.

29:53.874 --> 29:57.169
That mean we can get high
and never come down.

30:06.993 --> 30:09.642
What numbers did you pick?

30:09.712 --> 30:12.583
Your original aunt picked...

30:12.656 --> 30:14.991
six numbers.

30:15.055 --> 30:17.740
She used her weight, I think.

30:17.809 --> 30:19.662
Goddamn.

30:25.327 --> 30:27.628
I know why you got her now.

30:35.886 --> 30:37.794
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

30:37.869 --> 30:42.025
<i>Put some hot sauce
on my burrito, baby</i>

30:42.093 --> 30:44.614
<i>Don't you know it's good to me</i>

30:46.702 --> 30:48.522
Debo! Debo!

30:49.772 --> 30:52.936
- What?
- I can't feel my legs, man!

30:53.004 --> 30:55.818
<i>Put some hot sauce
on my burrito, baby</i>

30:56.940 --> 30:59.177
<i>You know you look good to me</i>

30:59.244 --> 31:00.901
Oh, man, that's good.

31:00.971 --> 31:03.719
Just hold on, Craig.
I'm comin', son.

31:32.967 --> 31:35.784
Negro, what the hell
you doin' to my woman?

31:35.850 --> 31:39.328
I don't know.
I must...

31:39.400 --> 31:41.887
- Suga?
- Huh?

31:41.960 --> 31:44.610
What the hell you doin'
to my nephew?

31:45.798 --> 31:47.971
I thought that was you, baby.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.502
Come on, baby.

31:49.573 --> 31:52.422
I'm faded, feelin' X-rated.

31:52.487 --> 31:54.658
It's Mr. Nasty time.

31:54.727 --> 31:58.020
Oh, Mr. Nasty time.

31:58.086 --> 32:00.257
It's Mr. Nasty time.

32:00.326 --> 32:02.300
Take it easy on my back.

32:02.373 --> 32:04.282
Be back in a minute.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.962
Make yourself at home, nephew.

32:12.037 --> 32:13.793
- Come on.
- Thanks.

32:23.844 --> 32:25.534
- That's it, that's it.
- Yeah, yeah.

32:31.523 --> 32:32.897
Call me Elroy!

32:38.690 --> 32:40.382
- Damn, Unc.
- That's enough.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.255
Get that shit.

33:11.360 --> 33:14.490
<i>Papi, I wish I was
with you right now.</i>

33:14.559 --> 33:16.413
Yeah, me too.

33:18.750 --> 33:21.499
Yeah? Well, you ever heard
of El Niño?

33:21.567 --> 33:23.421
Yeah.

33:23.485 --> 33:27.316
Well, this is El Negro.
Come here and let me tap that ass.

33:30.526 --> 33:32.468
Delivery.

33:33.852 --> 33:35.314
Got a delivery!

33:38.108 --> 33:40.925
- Who is it?
- Got a delivery. Come on, spark plug.

33:40.989 --> 33:43.771
I got a delivery.
It's hot out here, buddy.

33:43.837 --> 33:45.625
Come on, sparky.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.896
- What's up?
- Nice house.

33:47.963 --> 33:50.865
I didn't expect you to answer,
but this is a fine place.

33:50.939 --> 33:53.808
What are you,
one of those entertainer guys?

33:53.883 --> 33:56.217
Do you play sports?
What team you play for?

33:56.283 --> 33:58.998
I play for
the Cucamonga Cracker Killers.

33:59.066 --> 34:00.440
Don't want any trouble.

34:00.507 --> 34:04.401
You don't have to send your posse
out here to do a 187 in my ass.

34:04.474 --> 34:08.181
Just got a little mail
for you to sign, partner.

34:09.273 --> 34:12.371
- What's this?
- A delinquent property tax notice.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.297
I hope the Cracker Killers pay well.

34:14.362 --> 34:16.434
Otherwise, it's back
to the ghetto you go.

34:16.504 --> 34:18.804
<i>Take it easy.
Hustlin' and survivin'</i>

34:18.871 --> 34:21.261
<i>Good times</i>

34:21.337 --> 34:23.092
Oh, fuck!

34:23.159 --> 34:25.331
Good boy! Heel!

34:26.998 --> 34:30.993
"Your house will be seized
and auctioned...

34:31.063 --> 34:33.138
tomorrow at 9:00 a.m."

34:35.864 --> 34:38.253
Tomorrow?

34:40.789 --> 34:42.960
Uncle Elroy, you got some mail.

34:48.022 --> 34:49.996
Uncle Elroy, you got a notice.

35:22.067 --> 35:24.139
Damn.

35:24.211 --> 35:26.066
Unc is a freak.

35:38.960 --> 35:41.776
Unc, you got this tax notice, man.

35:45.617 --> 35:48.518
Come here!
I'll tear that ass up again!

35:48.592 --> 35:51.047
I like it when you treat me rough!

35:51.120 --> 35:53.160
God, man, what you doin'?

35:55.376 --> 35:57.895
Get your hands off my ass, girl!

35:57.968 --> 36:00.716
Let me go!
Let me go, goddamn it!

36:10.254 --> 36:12.110
Yo, Day-Day, check it out.

36:16.238 --> 36:19.108
<i>If Pinky come in and see you doin'
that X- Game shit off the counter...</i>

36:19.182 --> 36:20.555
we'll get fired.

36:20.620 --> 36:23.468
Motherfuckers! You motherfuckers!
What the fuck is this?

36:23.534 --> 36:25.388
- You motherfuckers!
- Can I help you?

36:25.454 --> 36:27.625
Yes. What is this, huh?

36:27.694 --> 36:30.596
This is rock.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.

36:30.670 --> 36:33.056
Where's the damn manager?
That Pink motherfucker.

36:33.131 --> 36:35.302
The manager's not here.
I'm running the store.

36:35.372 --> 36:38.024
You look like the player-hater
who sold me this shit.

36:38.093 --> 36:40.776
Give me my money back now!
And I have no damn receipt.

36:40.843 --> 36:42.697
- Where's the cover?
- I have no damn cover!

36:42.763 --> 36:45.958
- Kiss my ass! So what?
- Can I see it, sir?

36:47.435 --> 36:49.823
You been chewin' on this
before you came here?

36:49.898 --> 36:52.648
Bullshit! You know
who you're fucking with?

36:52.715 --> 36:55.682
- Bishop Tutu?
- Try again, motherfucker.

36:55.754 --> 36:58.175
- Winnie Mandela's little...
- Try again, motherfucker!

36:58.249 --> 36:59.624
Just an ugly black dude.

36:59.690 --> 37:01.577
I'll go postal on this motherfucker!

37:01.642 --> 37:04.390
You better get your hostile ass
out of here.

37:04.457 --> 37:06.463
You bitch.

37:07.305 --> 37:08.480
Oh, shit!

37:10.314 --> 37:13.062
Don't hit me. This is John Blaze.
I can get jiggy with it.

37:13.128 --> 37:15.777
- Get your ass out of here!
- I'm just a bitch-ass nigger.

37:15.847 --> 37:18.084
- Don't hit me!
- You see that?

37:20.263 --> 37:23.777
- How'd you get out here?
- I walked.

37:23.848 --> 37:26.564
You can't walk around this white
neighborhood. You look suspect.

37:26.631 --> 37:28.702
Y'all got a notice,
certified mail.

37:28.774 --> 37:32.004
Craig, this is Roach,
my white slave.

37:32.071 --> 37:35.387
Roach works around the store
doin' anything I tell him to.

37:35.463 --> 37:37.372
That's my cousin Craig
who beat up Debo.

37:37.446 --> 37:39.137
What's up, bro?

37:39.205 --> 37:41.377
- What's up?
- What do we got?

37:45.606 --> 37:47.580
- You know what this is?
- What is it?

37:47.653 --> 37:50.109
Get the phone!
You wouldn't know about this.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.997
- This is black problems.
- Pinky's.

37:54.182 --> 37:55.708
Yeah.

37:55.780 --> 37:59.458
We probably don't owe too much 'cause
we ain't been spending money that much.

38:00.803 --> 38:02.332
- Oh, man!
- What?

38:02.405 --> 38:04.379
We owe 3,900 by tomorrow.

38:04.451 --> 38:06.361
Shit, man!

38:06.436 --> 38:08.289
How much y'all got
from the lottery?

38:08.355 --> 38:10.744
I don't know.
I bought some shoes.

38:10.819 --> 38:12.827
I gotta check my book.

38:12.900 --> 38:15.135
- Check your bank book.
- Go back here with me.

38:15.203 --> 38:18.978
That African might have circled
around the block or something.

38:21.601 --> 38:24.023
Yeah, he's here.

38:24.098 --> 38:26.747
No, he's right here.
All right.

38:26.817 --> 38:30.166
- $247.
- That's it?

38:31.265 --> 38:33.338
- Who was that?
- This girl named D'wana.

38:33.409 --> 38:38.046
- She's outside and wants to talk to you.
- Come here. Get over here.

38:38.111 --> 38:39.388
Shit.

38:56.480 --> 38:59.828
- What's the matter?
- D'wana brought Baby D's fat ass here.

38:59.964 --> 39:02.999
Come on, D.
Let's fuck this nigger up.

39:11.516 --> 39:14.486
That white boy
said he was in here.

39:14.556 --> 39:17.372
Day-Day! Don't make me
break this window!

39:17.438 --> 39:19.379
- Craig, do me a favor.
- What?

39:19.453 --> 39:23.380
- Go tell them I ain't here.
- Hell no. I ain't in it.

39:23.452 --> 39:26.933
- You already in it, cuz.
- I'll just go do it.

39:27.005 --> 39:29.905
Get your ass back here!
What the fuck you doin'?

39:29.979 --> 39:33.808
She'll sit on your little ass.
Craig gotta do it.

39:33.883 --> 39:36.218
He beat Debo ass.

39:36.284 --> 39:38.737
And he cold. Craig?

39:38.811 --> 39:40.752
You gonna do that for me?

39:43.162 --> 39:44.590
Go ahead, man.

39:48.121 --> 39:50.292
Hurry up, nigger!

39:50.361 --> 39:51.888
Shut up.

39:55.066 --> 39:56.953
That don't look like Day-Day.

39:59.704 --> 40:01.396
Open the door.

40:03.704 --> 40:05.110
Day-Day ain't here.

40:05.176 --> 40:07.151
- Who are you?
- I'm his cousin.

40:07.225 --> 40:09.078
We didn't come here for Day-Day.

40:09.143 --> 40:11.632
- Yes, you did.
- No, we came to buy a CD.

40:11.705 --> 40:13.558
- Move!
- Punk.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.591
These whores ain't got no manners.

40:24.343 --> 40:27.190
Where that boy tellin' me
Day-Day was here?

40:27.255 --> 40:31.050
I don't know. I think he went
out back to throw away some boxes.

40:31.126 --> 40:34.322
- Well, can I look for myself?
- No, you cannot.

40:35.637 --> 40:38.638
- Hey, ladies.
- Where's Day-Day?

40:38.710 --> 40:41.905
- I thought y'all wanted to buy a CD.
- I do.

40:41.973 --> 40:44.689
Can you show me
where the jazz section is?

40:44.756 --> 40:46.315
Jazz?

40:47.315 --> 40:50.578
You know damn well
you don't want to hear jazz.

40:50.643 --> 40:52.105
Come on.

40:54.324 --> 40:56.078
I know y'all playin' games.

40:56.147 --> 40:59.181
If Day-Day come back,
tell him I need to see him...

40:59.251 --> 41:01.804
'cause the child-carin' classes
start on Wednesday.

41:01.875 --> 41:04.974
Come on, D.
I ain't got time for this. Wait.

41:05.041 --> 41:07.017
Ain't your restroom this way?

41:07.089 --> 41:09.359
You better have some toilet paper.

41:09.425 --> 41:13.038
- Damn!
- Here he is! Baby, here he is!

41:13.106 --> 41:14.894
Here, Baby! Get him!

41:20.081 --> 41:23.080
Come on. You better go on
with the bullshit.

41:23.152 --> 41:24.527
Do something about it!

41:24.593 --> 41:27.462
Why don't y'all do something
about this shit?

41:33.231 --> 41:35.533
- Come on!
- She moves well for a big girl.

41:40.623 --> 41:42.480
You better quit with the bullshit!

41:42.542 --> 41:46.088
- You better stop runnin' from that girl.
- Fuck you!

41:46.158 --> 41:49.803
Come on, big Baby D.
D'wana, I don't even like you like that.

41:49.869 --> 41:52.904
- Somebody call Jenny Craig.
- Hello. Remember me?

41:55.469 --> 41:57.411
Hell yeah, I remember you.

41:57.486 --> 42:00.331
I'm sorry about what my brothers
did to you this morning.

42:00.396 --> 42:01.772
They're just assholes.

42:01.837 --> 42:03.724
You don't have to apologize
for your brothers.

42:05.516 --> 42:08.712
I wanted to give you this.

42:08.779 --> 42:10.635
If my brothers weren't
so overprotective...

42:10.698 --> 42:14.114
I'd have you call the house, but for now
page me when you get a chance.

42:14.188 --> 42:16.643
- I'll do that.
- Better sooner than later.

42:16.716 --> 42:18.088
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:18.155 --> 42:20.011
Shit, it might be tonight.

42:20.074 --> 42:21.669
Get your ass back!

42:23.595 --> 42:25.832
Baby D, go on with the bullshit!

42:27.595 --> 42:30.377
You ain't gonna catch me,
as usual.

42:30.443 --> 42:33.889
Let's make a deal while we can.
You're not gonna catch me.

42:33.963 --> 42:36.329
What you want?
Another Big Pun CD? Kelly Price?

42:36.395 --> 42:38.150
- Luther Vandross?
- Hell no.

42:38.217 --> 42:41.283
That ain't gonna do?
How about that?

42:41.353 --> 42:44.167
Just like you had in the jail
commissary... without the wrapper.

42:44.232 --> 42:45.662
You can get to it quick.

42:45.738 --> 42:48.835
- I'm on a diet.
- No, your fat ass ain't.

42:48.905 --> 42:50.911
Yeah. Taste it, Baby D.

42:50.985 --> 42:53.157
Damn, it's good! Eat that...

42:54.217 --> 42:58.144
- Your cousin Craig, hook us up.
- That's it?

42:59.942 --> 43:03.007
Just tell him to come over here
and talk to me.

43:03.078 --> 43:06.461
- And I can go free?
- Go before I change my mind!

43:12.039 --> 43:13.663
What happened?

43:13.735 --> 43:16.931
Made a deal.
All you gotta do is go over there.

43:16.999 --> 43:20.194
- You gotta talk to her.
- What do you mean, "talk to her"?

43:20.262 --> 43:23.163
- She want to talk to you.
- Talk to me?

43:25.958 --> 43:28.641
Go talk to her.
Mother love. Fat...

43:31.749 --> 43:33.340
I'm gone.

43:34.340 --> 43:36.796
- Come on!
- Day-Day, I'm gonna kill your ass!

43:36.869 --> 43:38.876
You gotta come outside sometime!

43:40.260 --> 43:43.640
See, I done told you.
I done told you.

43:46.595 --> 43:48.699
Why you let her do this shit?

43:48.770 --> 43:51.521
- What was that?
- You don't wanna know.

43:53.090 --> 43:55.162
- Thanks a lot, Craig.
- Look.

43:55.234 --> 43:57.820
We cousins, but don't be tryin'
to hook me up...

43:57.891 --> 44:00.378
with the little sister
that's bigger than the big sister.

44:00.450 --> 44:03.744
- Fat bitches need love, too, Craig.
- For sure.

44:09.792 --> 44:12.062
Oh, man!

44:12.129 --> 44:13.982
Oh, my stomach.

44:14.048 --> 44:16.505
Say, let me get by!

44:17.377 --> 44:20.125
Too much hot sauce.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

44:23.615 --> 44:26.004
I gotta go to the bathroom.

44:27.137 --> 44:29.144
Let me over!

44:30.654 --> 44:32.116
Somebody help me, please!

44:33.311 --> 44:34.902
Too much traffic.

44:34.974 --> 44:37.690
What's this traffic doin'?

44:37.758 --> 44:40.855
Hey, y'all, move over!
Move up! Everybody, move!

44:48.798 --> 44:51.645
- Worst day of my life.
- Damn, you sad.

44:51.708 --> 44:53.945
I know how you're feelin', man.

44:54.014 --> 44:57.396
If I had my bong on me now,
I'd let you toke till you choke.

44:57.467 --> 44:58.930
I got this, though.

45:02.107 --> 45:05.782
- What's that green shit hangin' out?
- That's chronic, dude. Try it.

45:08.251 --> 45:12.856
I ain't got no bong
or no bullshit brownie, but voilà.

45:12.923 --> 45:14.003
Whoa!

45:15.193 --> 45:17.082
I'm the one with the problems!

45:18.425 --> 45:20.597
- Shit.
- Enjoy, man.

45:24.665 --> 45:27.032
Better open that window
before the smell get out.

45:27.097 --> 45:29.715
- These windows don't work in here.
- I got an idea.

45:29.785 --> 45:33.080
It's just a theory, but it should work.
Check this out.

45:39.191 --> 45:41.048
- Blow?
- Yeah, blow.

45:41.113 --> 45:43.632
- That ain't gonna work.
- Fuck yeah.

45:48.566 --> 45:51.569
- It works.
- Still gonna smell it.

45:51.638 --> 45:54.258
Uh-uh. Watch.

46:02.423 --> 46:03.797
Stop bullshittin'!

46:08.982 --> 46:11.797
- Stop bullshittin'!
- My fault, my fault.

46:11.862 --> 46:15.887
You better stop playin' so much!
Almost sucked my motherfuckin' lip up!

46:49.907 --> 46:51.596
Look here, baby.

46:51.665 --> 46:54.185
You hittin' them corners
too goddamn fast.

46:54.257 --> 46:56.592
You need to slow
this motherfucker down.

46:56.656 --> 47:00.616
I almost spilled my yak
on this $200 suit, nigger.

47:00.688 --> 47:03.177
Come on, baby,
get it together. Damn.

47:05.969 --> 47:07.877
Yeah, whatever, motherfucker.

47:21.710 --> 47:23.085
Shit.

47:33.932 --> 47:35.625
Roach, what you doin'?

47:42.861 --> 47:44.749
I caught a bad one again.

47:44.813 --> 47:46.568
<i>You busters is bitches</i>

47:46.637 --> 47:49.538
<i>You can't get your money
from your bitches</i>

47:49.612 --> 47:52.906
- Get back!
- Stop that bullshit, man!

47:52.971 --> 47:55.306
This vacuum shit don't work, man.

47:55.373 --> 47:58.241
Don't grab on Pinky's shit
like that.

47:59.595 --> 48:01.121
You company man.

48:01.195 --> 48:03.846
"Don't grab on Pinky's shit
like that."

48:03.916 --> 48:05.857
- Nigger, this is how I...
- Pinky?

48:05.932 --> 48:09.278
Pinky used to be a player.
I heard about Pinky...

48:09.353 --> 48:11.143
Where the bathroom at?

48:11.211 --> 48:12.900
Go to the right.

48:12.971 --> 48:15.872
Don't do that, man!
You gonna burn my Pinky shirt!

48:15.946 --> 48:18.335
I was just gonna get a promotion!

48:21.546 --> 48:24.032
Light an incense in there too.

48:24.104 --> 48:27.815
You stanky, booty-ass, little boy.
What's up, Roach?

48:27.881 --> 48:29.406
You bust your shit?

48:31.400 --> 48:32.960
Don't move!

48:35.751 --> 48:39.428
I'll blow your goddamn head
smooth off.

48:40.743 --> 48:42.685
Now, back up.

48:42.759 --> 48:44.612
Slowly!

48:44.678 --> 48:46.271
Don't say a word.

48:49.094 --> 48:51.812
- Hey, man...
- I said, don't say a word.

48:51.877 --> 48:53.733
Craig went to take a doo-doo.

48:53.798 --> 48:57.244
You ain't seen him
gettin' nothin' in the... to try to...

48:57.316 --> 49:00.514
- He miss?
- He don't try to make it fresh in there.

49:00.581 --> 49:03.003
Come on.

49:03.077 --> 49:05.794
Little motherfucker
gonna try to rob me.

49:05.860 --> 49:09.634
I'm gonna show you
how we do it here in Pinky's.

49:09.700 --> 49:12.034
- I wasn't tryin' to rob...
- Shut up!

49:12.100 --> 49:14.848
Before I bust a cap up in your ass.

49:14.914 --> 49:17.883
What you gone done
with Day-Day and Roach?

49:17.954 --> 49:19.866
- Day-Day is my...
- Shut up!

49:21.699 --> 49:25.472
- Now, who sent you, nigger?
- Nobody sent...

49:25.538 --> 49:30.428
Say another motherfuckin' word,
and this shit is over!

49:30.498 --> 49:32.569
And I ain't playin', nigger!

49:34.403 --> 49:36.672
Now...

49:36.737 --> 49:39.291
you ain't got no gun...

49:39.363 --> 49:41.534
but where the weed at?

49:41.602 --> 49:44.634
- I ain't got no...
- Shut the fuck... Shut...

49:44.706 --> 49:46.526
Did I say...

49:46.592 --> 49:49.406
Oh, shit, say it again!
Say something else!

49:50.977 --> 49:53.726
Say something else!
Say something else, nigger!

49:55.392 --> 49:58.426
I'm gonna tie your monkey-ass up.

49:58.496 --> 50:00.983
Oh, shit!

50:05.311 --> 50:07.165
He been doo-dooin' a long time.

50:07.230 --> 50:10.132
When he was a kid,
he doo-dooed in church.

50:10.206 --> 50:13.752
The pastor was the only one that could
stay in there through the blessings.

50:13.822 --> 50:15.927
I got your ass!

50:17.629 --> 50:19.059
Oh, shit.

50:24.636 --> 50:26.492
Craig doo-dooed
in the swimming pool.

50:26.558 --> 50:30.233
- We were swimming when we were little.
- Did it float up like a submarine?

50:30.299 --> 50:33.147
I was swimming, and I thought
it was a chocolate PayDay.

50:33.212 --> 50:36.343
I was swimmin' like a motherfucker,
and something just went...

50:36.411 --> 50:37.939
It kind of hit my...

50:39.258 --> 50:41.593
I got this motherfucker!

50:46.650 --> 50:49.466
Gonna blow up
where I make my money at.

50:49.532 --> 50:51.157
Is he comin'?

50:51.226 --> 50:54.293
Let me tell you something.
Can I say something to you?

50:54.362 --> 50:57.428
- I love you, man.
- Either be smokin' or be passin' that.

51:08.250 --> 51:11.511
I got to think of a way
to get this money by tomorrow.

51:11.576 --> 51:14.294
- Huh?
- I gotta think of..."Huh?"

51:14.361 --> 51:16.564
I gotta get this money by tomorrow.

51:16.633 --> 51:20.428
- You could sell your Beemer.
- I can do what?

51:20.504 --> 51:22.414
- Sell your car.
- Sell your mama's car.

51:22.487 --> 51:24.592
I'm not sellin' my car, man.

51:24.664 --> 51:27.860
- My bad.
- Don't say nothin' like that.

51:27.928 --> 51:30.230
- I know you love that car.
- Hell yeah.

51:30.294 --> 51:32.150
I gotta think of a plan.

51:32.216 --> 51:35.662
I hope Craig got some kind of plan
while he takin' a shit.

51:35.734 --> 51:38.386
- He in there a long time.
- Yeah, he in there a long time.

51:38.454 --> 51:40.875
Let's clean up
before Pinky get back.

51:44.791 --> 51:47.857
What's up, baby?
Come on, young blood. Don't kill me.

51:47.926 --> 51:50.095
Shut up!

51:50.165 --> 51:53.613
I been tryin' to tell your ass
that Day-Day's my cousin.

51:53.685 --> 51:55.060
He in the back.

51:55.125 --> 51:57.099
Whatever you say, baby.

51:57.173 --> 52:02.060
I swear to God, man, the combination
to the safe is 34-5-27, man.

52:02.133 --> 52:04.946
Just take it all, baby.
It's all yours. Just don't kill me.

52:05.011 --> 52:08.395
I got kids, a motherfuckin' girlfriend
and a wife on the side.

52:08.467 --> 52:09.580
Shut up!

52:12.082 --> 52:14.187
Don't kill me!
Goddamn, don't kill me!

52:15.506 --> 52:19.184
- Craig, what you doin'?
- Nothin'.

52:20.305 --> 52:23.274
- Huh?
- Is this your cousin?

52:23.347 --> 52:26.662
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Good. Then you fired.

52:26.738 --> 52:28.646
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

52:28.721 --> 52:30.095
I'm fired?

52:30.162 --> 52:33.095
- Roach, you fired too.
- Why you gotta fire me for?

52:33.168 --> 52:35.852
Shut up! Shut up!

52:35.922 --> 52:38.092
You better keep
your goddamn mouth shut!

52:38.160 --> 52:40.812
- Bobby Womack.
- I heard that shit. Say it again.

52:42.001 --> 52:43.756
Shit!

52:45.358 --> 52:46.734
And you lucky.

52:47.504 --> 52:50.319
I was just fixin'
to get up in your ass.

52:50.385 --> 52:53.351
Give me my pistol!
Get out of my store.

52:53.423 --> 52:55.310
Shut up!

52:55.376 --> 52:57.895
Punk ass.

52:57.966 --> 53:00.781
Tryin' to rob me.
Nigger, I'm Pinky.

53:02.286 --> 53:05.220
That nigger had me scared,
but I held my own.

53:05.325 --> 53:09.286
Fat bitch is bustin' my windows
all the time.

53:09.357 --> 53:12.173
I knew you shouldn't...
When you goin' home?

53:12.238 --> 53:13.830
<i>D's sayin'.</i>

53:13.901 --> 53:18.473
<i>In a strange way, I feel responsible
for Day-Day gettin' fired.</i>

53:18.542 --> 53:22.152
<i>If I wouldn't have fought Pinky
and gave Day-Day that joint...</i>

53:22.220 --> 53:24.609
<i>he'd still have a job by now.</i>

53:24.685 --> 53:26.440
<i>Roach too.</i>

53:26.508 --> 53:27.938
That's true.

53:28.013 --> 53:29.955
<i>Got to think of something...</i>

53:30.029 --> 53:33.127
<i>- Fat bitch bust my windows...
- as soon as he shut the fuck up.</i>

53:33.196 --> 53:36.806
You ain't even help me.
You watched her do the shit.

53:38.059 --> 53:41.027
And you quit hanging around
black people. You see how we live?

53:41.099 --> 53:44.482
We live wild. We live rough.
I'm tellin' you.

54:11.208 --> 54:13.762
Damn, Daddy,
I didn't know you had titties.

54:15.270 --> 54:18.139
We got a certified this
in the mail today.

54:22.566 --> 54:25.883
And I got fired today.

54:27.814 --> 54:29.091
Daddy!

54:30.596 --> 54:33.468
Mr. White Man, tell me what happened.
What's up there?

54:33.543 --> 54:36.739
<i>Mister, I gotta go help my son.
Let me over, please. Let me over.</i>

54:36.806 --> 54:40.449
I gotta help myself too.
I got a burning in my stomach.

54:40.517 --> 54:43.419
My stomach hurts. Oh, man.

54:43.493 --> 54:45.795
Officer, please.
Don't just drive past me.

54:45.861 --> 54:47.138
Officer!

54:47.205 --> 54:49.570
How long we gotta ride
in this stupid-ass van anyway?

54:49.635 --> 54:52.865
Fuck, I don't know. Shut up, man! Raise
your hand if you want to talk to me!

54:54.787 --> 54:57.088
Man, what we gonna do?

54:57.155 --> 54:59.227
I don't know yet.

54:59.300 --> 55:00.923
I know what I'm gonna do.

55:00.994 --> 55:02.937
I'm goin' home and face the music.

55:03.010 --> 55:06.140
My dad finds out I got fired again,
man, he's gonna kick my ass.

55:06.210 --> 55:09.505
- Sorry about today.
- Yeah, me too. Later.

55:17.410 --> 55:20.126
- My board!
- Get the board!

55:25.378 --> 55:27.613
My skateboard.

55:27.681 --> 55:29.950
Let's play some quarters and shit.
And don't forget the chips.

55:32.383 --> 55:35.417
- What the fuck you lookin' at?
- Nothin'. I...

55:37.599 --> 55:40.599
- You broke my board.
- It shouldn't have been in the street.

55:42.207 --> 55:44.793
Take me to Judge Judy. Let's go.

55:44.863 --> 55:47.449
- Who the fuck are those guys, Day-Day?
- Let it go, man. Trust me.

55:47.519 --> 55:49.818
I ain't lettin' shit go, man!
They broke my skateboard!

55:49.886 --> 55:52.734
- Let it go! Trust me.
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait! Look.

55:55.806 --> 55:57.911
- You see that?
- I ain't see nothin'.

55:57.982 --> 56:00.250
Must be money or somethin'
in that hydraulic pump.

56:00.316 --> 56:02.388
Yeah, air.

56:02.461 --> 56:05.691
It's somethin' better than air.
I could tell how funny he act.

56:05.756 --> 56:08.408
Hey, how's it goin', boy?
Come here. Yeah, boy, come here.

56:08.479 --> 56:11.792
Hey! What are you doin'?
Get the fuck off me!

56:11.867 --> 56:13.874
How do you know for sure?
It could be any damn thing in that pump.

56:13.947 --> 56:17.046
I don't know. It could be anything, but
I say we go over there and take a look.

56:17.116 --> 56:18.970
I say you go by your damn self.

56:19.035 --> 56:22.264
<i>I'm not fuckin' with them eses. Y'all go
over there and tag team and that shit.</i>

56:22.330 --> 56:24.884
All we need is
a big-ass pack of bologna.

56:26.620 --> 56:29.041
- Bologna?
- Yeah, bologna!

56:29.914 --> 56:34.899
Want me to get cheese and the hot plate?
We can cook over there. Eat with them...

56:34.970 --> 56:37.337
Man, just go get the bologna.
Hurry up.

56:42.041 --> 56:45.356
Is that a gas station over there?
Here we go. That's a gas station.

56:47.353 --> 56:49.206
Get out the way, man!
Come on! Move!

56:49.272 --> 56:51.128
This fool can't drive for shit!

56:51.961 --> 56:56.749
Guess I'm gonna have to kill that dad
of his, too, when I finish with Craig.

56:56.823 --> 56:59.671
Hey, man, get out the way!
Get out of the way! Hurry up!

56:59.735 --> 57:01.623
You look! I got some business
to take care of!

57:01.686 --> 57:03.955
- Fuck you, asshole!
- I hope the bathroom is clean.

57:04.023 --> 57:07.218
If it ain't, I don't give a damn.

57:07.287 --> 57:10.353
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, me.

57:15.541 --> 57:18.063
Damn! I knew I shouldn't
have eaten all that hot sauce.

57:22.102 --> 57:25.678
Sabu! I've seen all your movies, man.
Oh, you bad.

57:25.748 --> 57:28.270
Ridin' that magic carpet.
They ain't got to worry about no gas.

57:29.173 --> 57:31.857
Can I get the key to the bathroom?
I don't wanna buy no hubcap.

57:31.924 --> 57:33.583
It is here.

57:34.677 --> 57:36.563
And say hello to Qaddafi for me.

57:42.932 --> 57:43.979
- Hey!
- Hey!

57:44.052 --> 57:45.906
Come on out of there!
I got an emergency here!

57:45.971 --> 57:49.355
- Hold on!
- Come on, man! Come on out of there.

57:49.428 --> 57:52.742
- Who's bangin' on this friggin' door...
- Come on outta here.

57:52.818 --> 57:54.674
- Mr. Jones?
- Stanley?

57:54.739 --> 57:56.713
- How are ya?
- What are you doin' here?

57:56.787 --> 58:00.234
I'm looking for a new house out here.
I have to move out of the hood.

58:00.306 --> 58:02.761
- The crime is really getting bad.
- Yeah, I gotta go.

58:02.834 --> 58:06.410
I wouldn't recommend that anybody
go in there for at least 35, 45 minutes.

58:06.481 --> 58:08.369
It's smelling pretty bad.
I don't know what happened.

58:08.432 --> 58:10.442
Get the fuck outta my face!

58:12.784 --> 58:14.638
Oh, Lord!

58:20.626 --> 58:22.150
Thank God.

58:27.727 --> 58:29.582
Come on. Stay down.

58:32.272 --> 58:34.410
- Y'all ready?
- No.

58:34.479 --> 58:35.853
Come on.

58:38.830 --> 58:40.837
There's Joker! Run!
Goddamn it! Run!

58:45.069 --> 58:47.076
I don't see nobody.

58:47.149 --> 58:48.523
Come on.

58:50.541 --> 58:51.917
Hurry up.

58:55.182 --> 58:57.254
Nice booty.

58:57.326 --> 59:00.359
- Come here. You can have some.
- You know I do.

59:01.739 --> 59:05.035
- Where you goin', baby?
- Right over here.

59:05.100 --> 59:07.402
I'm nervous, man.
I got the BGs.

59:07.468 --> 59:10.369
- What's the BGs?
- The bubble guts.

59:10.444 --> 59:13.126
I'm nervous, and
I'm about to shit on myself.

59:13.195 --> 59:15.748
Keep a tight ass.
Try and hold it in or somethin'.

59:15.819 --> 59:17.030
Shut up.

59:17.099 --> 59:19.139
That sound like butterflies to me.

59:19.211 --> 59:21.479
Butterflies, your ass.
I'm about to go home.

59:21.545 --> 59:26.086
Look, look. If we don't go do this,
you ain't gonna have no home to go to.

59:26.154 --> 59:29.830
All we gotta do is find out
where the little one put that pump...

59:29.897 --> 59:32.001
take it and see what's in it.

59:32.073 --> 59:35.784
You're in the Kentucky Derby.
I'll take this off.

59:38.569 --> 59:40.031
Oh, shit.

59:41.640 --> 59:43.680
Go, Flea Biscuit.

59:43.753 --> 59:45.281
Thought you were gonna
take me to see Mommy.

59:47.208 --> 59:50.022
I'm a little preoccupied right now.

59:51.047 --> 59:52.258
I'll take you later.

59:52.328 --> 59:54.238
When? After you're
all drunk and loaded?

59:54.313 --> 59:56.766
I said I'll take
your stupid ass later, all right?

59:56.839 --> 59:58.944
Get the fuck outta here.
You're ruining my company.

01:00:06.535 --> 01:00:08.956
- What's this silver thing right here?
- What silver thing?

01:00:10.949 --> 01:00:14.397
We got to count that shit.
Get up.

01:00:14.469 --> 01:00:16.739
Business first.

01:00:16.804 --> 01:00:18.746
Hey, Baby Joker, come on.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.512
Forgot about the business.

01:00:21.542 --> 01:00:26.297
I need you to occupy that dog long
enough for me and Day-Day to get a look.

01:00:26.372 --> 01:00:29.186
Me and dogs don't get along, bro.

01:00:29.252 --> 01:00:32.317
- Get along with this one.
- Shit. What's his name?

01:00:32.387 --> 01:00:35.802
Cheeco. You've got to go ahead of us.
Don't get seen.

01:00:35.876 --> 01:00:38.145
And for damn sure,
don't let that mutt out your sight.

01:00:38.212 --> 01:00:39.870
Go, go, go!

01:00:39.938 --> 01:00:44.346
- Dog, we scored today, fool.
- Yeah!

01:00:44.419 --> 01:00:47.648
- What's that on my leg?
- What is that, dog?

01:00:47.716 --> 01:00:50.234
Forget it. I think
it's yogurt or something.

01:00:58.785 --> 01:01:00.159
Here, Cheeco.

01:01:06.687 --> 01:01:08.632
Get off my ass, man.

01:01:11.425 --> 01:01:14.968
Get down! You guys are better
than the Soul Train dancers.

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:16.764
Look at them old bitties.

01:01:16.831 --> 01:01:18.720
God!

01:01:18.784 --> 01:01:21.119
Come on. Let's go. Get up.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.108
All right, go first.

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:28.765
- Go first.
- No, nigger, you go first!

01:01:28.831 --> 01:01:31.001
I'm not goin' first.

01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:33.851
If you don't hit that fence,
I'm gonna throw you over.

01:01:33.917 --> 01:01:35.891
Nigger, I'm not...
We ain't little no more.

01:01:35.964 --> 01:01:39.543
That's the thing about it.
Come on. Come on!

01:01:39.614 --> 01:01:42.613
What you talkin' about?
We ain't little? What?

01:01:42.684 --> 01:01:44.375
Come on, nigger.

01:01:44.444 --> 01:01:45.874
- Pussy.
- It ain't like that.

01:01:45.949 --> 01:01:47.858
Get your ass up.

01:02:03.002 --> 01:02:04.694
- Stop playing.
- I broke a butt cheek.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:07.893
- Come on.
- Shit, man.

01:02:07.963 --> 01:02:09.620
What, man?

01:02:09.691 --> 01:02:11.066
Fuck.

01:02:14.299 --> 01:02:15.989
Come here, boy.

01:02:16.058 --> 01:02:17.913
Come on, Cheeco.

01:02:17.977 --> 01:02:19.832
Be a good boy.

01:02:20.697 --> 01:02:22.291
Shit! Oh, shit.

01:02:23.993 --> 01:02:26.711
- Fuck this shit.
- Hey, hey. Wait.

01:02:30.938 --> 01:02:33.302
- Who's got the money...
- He's still over there.

01:02:33.368 --> 01:02:35.407
- Hundreds, fifties.
- Roach still got him.

01:02:39.574 --> 01:02:42.870
- What do we do with these ones?
- Fuck it. Give it to charity.

01:02:42.936 --> 01:02:45.424
<i>Fuck it.
Charity starts in la casa.</i>

01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:47.763
- We can give it to the bitches.
- It is money in that pump.

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:49.259
- It is?
- Yeah.

01:02:49.334 --> 01:02:51.122
A good boy. Come on.

01:02:51.926 --> 01:02:53.683
Here you go. Good boy.

01:02:54.839 --> 01:02:57.805
Good boy. I got
some good bologna for you.

01:02:57.878 --> 01:03:01.673
Good boy. Eat it all up.

01:03:01.749 --> 01:03:04.084
Okay, you ate it all up.

01:03:10.133 --> 01:03:12.304
Is that Cheeco?
What's wrong with him?

01:03:12.373 --> 01:03:15.439
I don't know.
That dog got issues.

01:03:16.883 --> 01:03:19.852
<i>So what's wrong with my perro?
What'd you do to my dog, fool?</i>

01:03:19.925 --> 01:03:23.819
Nothing. Just keep
counting the money.

01:03:26.739 --> 01:03:28.746
Hey, fuck that shit. Do it later.

01:03:28.819 --> 01:03:31.884
It's fuckin' Friday.
We got fuckin' bitches.

01:03:31.955 --> 01:03:33.645
It's fuckin' time to party.

01:03:33.715 --> 01:03:35.886
Shut the door. What's wrong with you?
Don't you got no manners?

01:03:35.953 --> 01:03:38.540
- What's wrong with you?
- Fuckin' snapper.

01:03:38.611 --> 01:03:42.701
We're not gonna close the door
until you come out and party with us.

01:03:42.771 --> 01:03:44.626
Let me think about it.

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:48.584
Count my money.
Party with bitches.

01:03:48.657 --> 01:03:51.273
Hundreds and fifties.
Big-ass titties.

01:03:52.527 --> 01:03:56.968
Count the green.
Get in between those titties.

01:03:57.041 --> 01:03:58.448
Let's party!

01:03:58.513 --> 01:04:00.781
Come on, fool!

01:04:00.847 --> 01:04:03.236
Put that shit in the drawer.

01:04:03.312 --> 01:04:07.108
I'm in the mood to get jiggy with it.
I wanna party.

01:04:07.183 --> 01:04:09.189
Aztec warrior. Aztec warrior.

01:04:16.622 --> 01:04:19.917
He put it in a drawer.
I'm gonna go get it.

01:04:19.982 --> 01:04:22.884
You want me to wait here,
so Cheeco can bite me in my ass?

01:04:22.957 --> 01:04:26.220
- Yeah!
- I'm goin'. I'm not doin' nothin'.

01:04:26.286 --> 01:04:29.034
- What, man?
- I'm gonna tell you once more. Sit.

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:31.206
Get the finger outta my...

01:04:43.659 --> 01:04:45.384
Damn.

01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:46.826
Yea, yea.

01:04:47.947 --> 01:04:51.111
You got that Ricky Martin CD?
I love him. He's a musical god.

01:04:51.178 --> 01:04:56.776
He's good for my people.
Come on. All right. I wanna dance.

01:04:56.844 --> 01:04:58.216
Damn.

01:05:07.786 --> 01:05:09.673
Calm down.
I got something for you.

01:05:09.737 --> 01:05:11.524
Got a treat.

01:05:11.592 --> 01:05:15.170
You're gonna like this.
I got a little bud brownie.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.631
Here. Just eat the whole thing.
Here. Just eat it all up.

01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:19.940
Good boy. Eat it up.

01:05:20.008 --> 01:05:24.383
Eat it up. Eat it up.
Good dog. Good dog.

01:05:29.032 --> 01:05:30.886
We're gonna party now.

01:05:33.032 --> 01:05:34.940
What the fuck?

01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:38.213
Hey, who locked
the fuckin' door, huh?

01:05:38.279 --> 01:05:41.126
I don't like locked doors around here!
They make me crazy and shit!

01:05:41.191 --> 01:05:44.420
I was locked up!
Pass the wire! Pass the wire!

01:05:44.486 --> 01:05:47.551
I don't want no grilled cheese.
No, Leroy, I'm bilingual!

01:05:47.622 --> 01:05:51.418
There's a difference.
No more locked doors!

01:05:58.499 --> 01:06:00.444
No more locked doors around here,
you hear me?

01:06:01.382 --> 01:06:04.762
What you been eating, girl?
Nothing but light beer for you.

01:06:07.811 --> 01:06:09.306
I like it rough.

01:06:09.381 --> 01:06:12.927
Oh, you do, huh? Good,
'cause that's how you're gonna get it.

01:06:23.364 --> 01:06:26.590
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

01:06:26.657 --> 01:06:31.198
- What are you doing here?
- I hope you don't think I'm crazy.

01:06:31.266 --> 01:06:34.112
I snuck in here to show you that
I wasn't scared of your punk brothers.

01:06:34.178 --> 01:06:37.756
And if you had a man
like me in your life...

01:06:37.826 --> 01:06:40.158
you wouldn't have to be
scared of them neither.

01:06:40.224 --> 01:06:43.095
What? So you snuck in my room
to tell me that?

01:06:44.161 --> 01:06:45.469
Yeah, I did. Excuse me.

01:06:47.359 --> 01:06:50.360
- Who you talking to?
- Nobody!

01:06:50.433 --> 01:06:54.076
<i>- I heard a vato's voice in here.
- No, you didn't. Get out of my room.</i>

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:56.511
Go back to your
stupid little girlfriends.

01:06:56.576 --> 01:06:57.784
I'm telling Mom.

01:06:57.854 --> 01:07:00.855
Good boy. Feel that?

01:07:00.925 --> 01:07:03.829
Good dog. Lay down.

01:07:03.903 --> 01:07:08.158
That's a good boy. Lay down.
Yeah, you're a good boy.

01:07:09.822 --> 01:07:12.472
You are a good dog.

01:07:13.501 --> 01:07:15.672
Oh, I'm gonna do you good.

01:07:15.741 --> 01:07:17.595
I'm gonna give it to you rough.

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:21.590
Here's Johnny.
I call him Mini Me.

01:07:21.661 --> 01:07:25.173
<i>I'm gonna do you like American Me,
baby. Don't look at me.</i>

01:07:25.245 --> 01:07:28.988
Don't look at me, little puppy.
Can I get a whoo, whoo?

01:07:29.051 --> 01:07:31.473
I'm an Aztec warrior.

01:07:35.228 --> 01:07:39.319
Bring your ass home, Craig.
Come on.

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:42.201
Hey, I'm cold.
I'll close the window.

01:07:44.027 --> 01:07:45.401
Oh, shit.

01:07:51.898 --> 01:07:55.639
Motherfuckers can't fuck with me.
I'm a player. I'm a player!

01:07:56.602 --> 01:07:58.455
Like I was sayin'.

01:08:00.729 --> 01:08:02.104
Are you listening?

01:08:05.688 --> 01:08:07.662
We don't need this shit.

01:08:07.736 --> 01:08:10.224
A guy like me
and a dog like you...

01:08:10.296 --> 01:08:12.270
we ought to be in Maui...

01:08:12.345 --> 01:08:15.476
rentin' Jet Skis to fat fucks
with flower shirts.

01:08:21.527 --> 01:08:23.828
That'd be the good life.

01:08:23.894 --> 01:08:28.912
Take you with me wherever I go.
I love you.

01:08:28.982 --> 01:08:31.371
- It'll work.
- Come on.

01:08:31.447 --> 01:08:33.334
- Where's Craig?
- He's in the house still.

01:08:34.421 --> 01:08:36.332
- Why'd he go in the house?
- Don't worry about it.

01:08:36.406 --> 01:08:38.675
We gotta figure out a way to get him
out of there. He's probably locked up.

01:08:38.742 --> 01:08:41.707
- Come on.
- Shit.

01:08:42.997 --> 01:08:46.859
- You did all this for me?
- Most of it.

01:08:48.404 --> 01:08:50.706
I just hate to see a fine girl like you
in a situation like this.

01:08:52.468 --> 01:08:54.703
Thanks for noticing.

01:08:54.772 --> 01:08:57.292
It used to be peaceful around here
before they got out.

01:08:58.484 --> 01:09:01.648
They took over the house and
caused my mother's nervous breakdown.

01:09:01.715 --> 01:09:04.814
Dang. Why she didn't
just kick 'em out?

01:09:04.884 --> 01:09:07.216
We tried.

01:09:07.283 --> 01:09:10.216
We saved up to get away from them,
but they just followed us.

01:09:10.291 --> 01:09:14.120
Damn. I hate to hear that.
Can I get out this window right here?

01:09:15.314 --> 01:09:19.023
- I thought you came up here to see me.
- I did. It's just, you know...

01:09:19.091 --> 01:09:21.511
What's the hurry?

01:09:21.586 --> 01:09:23.528
I got my cousin out here
waitin' on me.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.966
So what?

01:09:26.032 --> 01:09:27.886
Let's make him wait.

01:09:30.992 --> 01:09:32.586
Okay, knock.

01:09:32.656 --> 01:09:35.143
- You want me to knock?
- Knock!

01:09:37.295 --> 01:09:39.881
You're actin' like a little bitch
right now, man.

01:09:39.952 --> 01:09:42.024
They can't hear that.
The music's playin'.

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:45.029
Excuse me, partner. That was
a fuckin' ghetto knock I just did.

01:09:45.104 --> 01:09:47.720
- I'll show you how to knock on a door.
- What ya doin'? Stop...

01:09:47.788 --> 01:09:50.661
Yeah. Rub that shit.

01:09:51.694 --> 01:09:53.550
I hear something.

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:57.250
Fuck.

01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:59.530
I can't do anything
around here! Shit!

01:10:01.134 --> 01:10:02.660
Ruining my flow.

01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:05.644
Right there.

01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:07.464
Lover boys, you hear that shit?

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:10.092
You better stop.

01:10:10.158 --> 01:10:12.808
- They gonna think we're the police!
- It gets results.

01:10:14.028 --> 01:10:15.239
What do you want?

01:10:16.268 --> 01:10:17.795
We came to borrow some sugar.

01:10:19.051 --> 01:10:21.321
Does this look like
a fuckin' 7-Eleven to you?

01:10:21.388 --> 01:10:23.296
Do you see that red dot
on my forehead?

01:10:23.371 --> 01:10:26.056
Do you see an ATM in the corner
that doesn't work?

01:10:26.124 --> 01:10:28.840
Do you? No, you don't,
so fuck you, my friend.

01:10:28.907 --> 01:10:30.696
Get the fuck outta here.

01:10:30.763 --> 01:10:32.007
You too, Slim Shady.

01:10:32.075 --> 01:10:35.685
- No problem. We gone.
- Hold on a second.

01:10:35.754 --> 01:10:40.293
Hey, man, you ran over my skateboard.
I don't appreciate that, all right?

01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:43.330
That's bullshit, man. It ain't...

01:11:00.168 --> 01:11:01.445
Got your message.
Where's Craig?

01:11:02.184 --> 01:11:04.421
Message? I ain't sent you
no damn message!

01:11:04.488 --> 01:11:06.276
You didn't call the sandwich joint
with an urgent message?

01:11:06.344 --> 01:11:10.084
Hell, no, Willie!
You startin' to think like a dog.

01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:12.485
Believe them fleas and ticks
suckin' on your old-ass brain.

01:11:12.552 --> 01:11:14.339
Somebody sent me a message.
Where's Craig and Day-Day?

01:11:14.407 --> 01:11:16.577
I don't know.

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:18.501
Come on in.

01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:23.715
You know you got shit
all over the back of your ass?

01:11:23.782 --> 01:11:27.164
Don't sit on that couch!
Put some paper down.

01:11:27.238 --> 01:11:29.059
Next time page me first.

01:11:29.125 --> 01:11:31.678
Okay, I'll do that.
What's my code, 69?

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:34.816
- No, 68.
- Yeah, right.

01:11:34.886 --> 01:11:35.780
Shit.

01:11:38.756 --> 01:11:40.315
You okay?

01:11:45.763 --> 01:11:48.762
This is some bullshit. We just
came over here to borrow some sugar.

01:11:48.835 --> 01:11:51.769
- And some Phillies.
- And some Phillies and...

01:11:51.842 --> 01:11:54.713
We ain't come to fuck up
y'all little ménage à trois.

01:11:54.786 --> 01:11:58.780
These are some bad bitches y'all got
over here and we would not fuck that up.

01:11:58.851 --> 01:12:01.369
- How y'all doin' anyway?
- Fine.

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:02.369
Hey!

01:12:02.433 --> 01:12:04.539
My name is Day-Day.
I'm your local neighborhood player.

01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:06.649
This is my little buddy Roach.
Roach, say, "What's happenin'?" to them.

01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:08.893
- Nice to meet you ladies.
- Hey, hey!

01:12:08.962 --> 01:12:10.238
What the fuck?

01:12:11.552 --> 01:12:13.788
<i>This isn't The Love Connection.</i>

01:12:13.856 --> 01:12:17.086
<i>Trying to pick up on our hynas or what,
eh? Want to go to the room right now?</i>

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:21.434
I don't know about you two.
I don't know about this sugar shit.

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.478
I know black people got a lot
of sugar in their house.

01:12:24.287 --> 01:12:26.393
So I don't know.
You makin' me susp...

01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:31.318
- Suspicious, eh?
- It's makin' me think a lot! Smart guy.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.957
He's tryin' to make it
with our chicks.

01:12:40.159 --> 01:12:42.013
- What'd he say?
- I don't know.

01:12:42.078 --> 01:12:44.053
Karla's coming down.
Give me the weapon.

01:12:45.214 --> 01:12:48.476
- Shut the fuck up and act natural.
- No problem.

01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:54.487
- Hey. What's goin' on?
- Nothing.

01:12:57.149 --> 01:12:59.354
Are you going to give me
a ride to see Mommy?

01:12:59.419 --> 01:13:02.802
Dang! You bug! Look,
just take my car, all right?

01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:05.397
- Take your car?
- Did I stutter?

01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:08.436
- Did I stutter?
- Hell, no. You ain't...

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:10.844
Shut up, stupid.
Just give me your car keys.

01:13:10.907 --> 01:13:13.045
- I'm not stupid. You're stupid.
- You're stupid.

01:13:13.115 --> 01:13:15.023
- Don't call me stupid. I'm sensitive.
- Where's the car keys?

01:13:15.098 --> 01:13:17.521
- You're stupid!
- I'll be back in a bit. Bye.

01:13:17.596 --> 01:13:19.189
- Chickenhead.
- Stupid ass.

01:13:19.259 --> 01:13:21.235
Don't be hittin' my switches too.

01:13:21.305 --> 01:13:23.607
And tell Mama we miss her cooking.

01:13:25.019 --> 01:13:28.728
You know what? If everything's cool,
then we'll let you bounce too.

01:13:28.794 --> 01:13:32.022
That's a deal.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:13:42.776 --> 01:13:45.393
- Where the hell you been?
- I was over...

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:47.635
This is my boy.
I'm the only one who can yell at him.

01:13:47.704 --> 01:13:50.551
- Where the hell you been?
- Have y'all seen Day-Day?

01:13:50.616 --> 01:13:53.681
Thought he was with you.

01:13:53.751 --> 01:13:57.297
I knew we'd never be together forever.
You're a cold little Puerto Rican dude.

01:14:03.607 --> 01:14:06.028
- What?
- We're saying you're fucked!

01:14:06.102 --> 01:14:08.078
- You're staying with us.
- Oh, man.

01:14:08.151 --> 01:14:10.932
Baby Joker, get the duct tape.

01:14:12.533 --> 01:14:14.192
It's on my bed.
I was using it earlier.

01:14:14.262 --> 01:14:18.036
- Shit, man!
- And, you, put your clothes back on.

01:14:22.101 --> 01:14:24.785
Come on. The party's over.
Get your chickie heads outta here!

01:14:24.851 --> 01:14:28.845
Come on! Move it, hood-rat. Get your ass
outta here. Bus leaves at 11:00!

01:14:28.917 --> 01:14:31.089
Take this shit with you!

01:14:31.156 --> 01:14:32.399
Call me!

01:14:33.236 --> 01:14:35.855
- What a jerk.
- He's stupid.

01:14:35.923 --> 01:14:37.777
- What did we do?
- Why does he need tape?

01:14:37.843 --> 01:14:41.356
- Tell us what we did.
- You're fucked. Gonna have a party.

01:14:41.428 --> 01:14:44.395
- What kind of party?
- A prison party. We just got out.

01:14:44.467 --> 01:14:47.281
I know what to do with you.

01:14:47.346 --> 01:14:48.906
- Shit!
- He's cute, huh?

01:14:48.978 --> 01:14:50.867
- I want the little one.
- He's like a Frosted Mini-Wheat.

01:14:50.929 --> 01:14:52.622
Hold on, baby.

01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:55.504
- It's gonna be crazy.
- Don't do that.

01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:57.291
You haven't seen my Aztec warrior.

01:14:57.361 --> 01:15:00.327
- I can't handle this!
- You can't handle them?

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.696
- You can handle them.
- You got a pretty mouth.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.136
Don't do that!

01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:06.826
<i>Don't do it.</i>

01:15:06.897 --> 01:15:08.750
- You think they in there?
- They in there.

01:15:08.815 --> 01:15:10.475
We got to do something.

01:15:10.545 --> 01:15:12.651
Y'all take your asses over there
if you want to.

01:15:12.721 --> 01:15:17.258
If you ain't back in ten minutes, I'm
callin' the police and insurance man.

01:15:17.328 --> 01:15:20.425
Wait a minute.
I'm goin' to get my shit.

01:15:22.447 --> 01:15:24.813
<i>How many of us have them</i>

01:15:24.879 --> 01:15:27.213
<i>Friends</i>

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.221
<i>Ones we can depend on</i>

01:15:29.295 --> 01:15:31.149
<i>Friends</i>

01:15:31.215 --> 01:15:33.668
Shut the fuck up!

01:15:35.695 --> 01:15:38.060
I don't even like Whodini.

01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:41.923
We can be friends as soon as
you tell me where my money is.

01:15:41.995 --> 01:15:45.609
Money? We came to borrow sugar from ya
and some rollin' papers.

01:15:45.678 --> 01:15:49.190
We wanted to get high. I was gonna show
this white boy how to make Kool-Aid...

01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:51.845
Shit!

01:15:51.915 --> 01:15:54.153
Just have a heart, Mr. Joker.
Please. It's Friday!

01:15:54.222 --> 01:15:57.668
- I know what fuckin' day it is.
- Oh, shit! Fuck.

01:15:57.739 --> 01:16:01.122
I hear a lot of talking,
but the words don't mean shit.

01:16:04.845 --> 01:16:06.818
<i>Maybe that other chanate took it.
Remember him?</i>

01:16:09.451 --> 01:16:14.371
<i>Hey, Day-Day,
where is your other mayate?</i>

01:16:34.184 --> 01:16:36.454
It's a nice piece of heat
you got there.

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:39.139
Thank you. I ain't got but
two bullets in the motherfucker.

01:16:39.208 --> 01:16:41.541
- But that's better than nothin'.
- Yeah, it is.

01:16:41.607 --> 01:16:44.390
Two bullets? Boy, your ass
ain't changed at all.

01:16:44.456 --> 01:16:47.008
Back in the day,
only thing I had was a stick.

01:16:47.079 --> 01:16:49.893
You missed with your stick. I ain't
gonna miss with these two bullets.

01:16:49.958 --> 01:16:52.227
Hey, y'all. Not now. Come on.

01:17:00.774 --> 01:17:03.643
- Come on. You know what to do.
- Shit!

01:17:07.557 --> 01:17:09.413
That's Versace you steppin' on.

01:17:09.478 --> 01:17:11.843
Versace?
You can't even spell Versace.

01:17:11.908 --> 01:17:16.481
"Fo-satchy." F-O... satchy.

01:17:32.163 --> 01:17:33.440
Damn.

01:17:33.505 --> 01:17:35.361
You all right?

01:17:36.961 --> 01:17:39.647
- Yeah.
- Will you be quiet, Tarzan?

01:17:39.715 --> 01:17:42.080
I don't do this shit every day.

01:17:43.651 --> 01:17:47.742
I'm tellin' you, man.
You can do a lot for this community...

01:17:47.811 --> 01:17:51.039
Shut up!
I'm sick of bullshitting with you two.

01:17:51.106 --> 01:17:52.380
Baby Joker?

01:18:00.096 --> 01:18:01.689
- Little Joker?
- Yeah.

01:18:01.759 --> 01:18:03.036
Tape their mouths shut.

01:18:04.384 --> 01:18:06.238
I don't wanna hear
a grown man scream.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.751
Shit.

01:18:17.823 --> 01:18:19.198
What, man?

01:18:19.264 --> 01:18:21.684
We must be here. We stopped.

01:18:21.758 --> 01:18:25.436
Good. Let's get the hell outta here.
It stink in here.

01:18:25.502 --> 01:18:28.633
- How do we get out?
- How am I supposed to know?

01:18:28.702 --> 01:18:31.669
You the one with all the muscle.
Why don't you get us outta here?

01:18:31.743 --> 01:18:33.050
Raise your hand, fool.

01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:37.851
Now let me show you
how we gonna do this.

01:19:04.249 --> 01:19:08.047
Come on, man! Let me outta here!
Come on, man! I'm your brother!

01:19:09.529 --> 01:19:12.280
Come on! Don't do this
to your own brother, man!

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:13.589
Get out, fool.

01:19:31.832 --> 01:19:33.042
Damn.

01:19:35.927 --> 01:19:38.796
Hey, young man.

01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:41.739
You got knocked the fuck out.

01:19:41.814 --> 01:19:44.533
No more fun and games.

01:19:44.599 --> 01:19:47.315
<i>My little carnal,
he went to get my chain saw.</i>

01:19:48.887 --> 01:19:51.252
<i>I'm gonna show you what happens
to putos that take my money...</i>

01:19:51.318 --> 01:19:53.357
and don't tell me
what I wanna hear.

01:19:55.126 --> 01:19:57.328
<i>Ever see Scarface, fuckers?</i>

01:20:02.069 --> 01:20:03.978
Go see what's takin' him so long.

01:20:09.716 --> 01:20:11.089
Junior?

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:14.000
Junior?

01:20:14.067 --> 01:20:15.923
What the fuck, stupid?

01:20:21.393 --> 01:20:22.954
My back!

01:20:23.923 --> 01:20:27.631
- What's the matter?
- I believe I slipped my disk again.

01:20:27.698 --> 01:20:30.218
Goddamn!

01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:32.395
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me!

01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:36.687
Ain't nothin' wrong with you.
Get your big ass up.

01:20:36.755 --> 01:20:38.988
I'll tie this boy up myself.

01:20:39.057 --> 01:20:41.161
I should tie your big ass up, too,
and drag you down the street.

01:20:44.818 --> 01:20:47.434
You players are going
on the disabled list...

01:20:48.688 --> 01:20:50.574
as soon as my brothers
get back here.

01:20:55.537 --> 01:20:57.478
They should be back here
any minute now.

01:20:59.408 --> 01:21:01.797
They'll be back soon.

01:21:03.952 --> 01:21:06.089
Fuck! Where are these fuckers?

01:21:06.158 --> 01:21:09.419
I gotta do everything. It's tough
being the brains of the operation.

01:21:10.224 --> 01:21:11.367
Fuck!

01:21:11.438 --> 01:21:14.220
<i>Hey! You putos go?</i>

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:17.700
You gonna make me crazy!
You make me crazy! Come on!

01:21:17.773 --> 01:21:20.674
- Makin' me look like a punk!
- It slipped!

01:21:20.748 --> 01:21:24.294
- My disk slipped again in my back.
- What the fuck?

01:21:28.269 --> 01:21:30.243
What the hell are you doing here?

01:21:30.316 --> 01:21:33.034
I lost something.
What it look like, fool?

01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:34.955
<i>It looks like a dead mayate
with a loud shirt.</i>

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:37.987
My mind! That's what I lost.
Ain't this my yard?

01:21:40.683 --> 01:21:42.276
Get up!

01:21:43.722 --> 01:21:46.538
Watch his feet.
Watch his feet, boy.

01:21:47.947 --> 01:21:48.994
Fucker!

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:20.093
School's in, bitch.

01:22:20.872 --> 01:22:22.050
Motherfucker.

01:22:22.121 --> 01:22:24.062
I got your ass right here.

01:22:25.063 --> 01:22:29.797
I'm gonna kick your ass for gettin' me
into this mess, throwin' my back out.

01:22:30.598 --> 01:22:33.316
Daddy, it ain't my fault!
I'm not bullshittin'.

01:22:33.383 --> 01:22:36.797
I was hangin' with this white boy,
and he got me into all kinds of shi...

01:22:43.942 --> 01:22:44.989
Damn!

01:22:45.063 --> 01:22:46.305
What's up?

01:22:47.653 --> 01:22:48.897
Help!

01:22:51.237 --> 01:22:52.697
Shit!

01:22:52.773 --> 01:22:54.180
Get up!

01:22:57.892 --> 01:23:00.860
Say hello to my little friend.

01:23:06.563 --> 01:23:10.272
Yeah, that's it! I'm gonna blast
this fool. Give me that gun.

01:23:10.337 --> 01:23:14.169
- Here!
- Come on, fool. Remember me, punk?

01:23:14.819 --> 01:23:16.096
Lord, have mercy.

01:23:35.168 --> 01:23:37.886
What you want me to do?
Bad dog!

01:23:38.817 --> 01:23:40.093
- Freeze!
- Hands up!

01:23:40.161 --> 01:23:42.581
Two giant Milk Duds.

01:23:43.297 --> 01:23:45.304
Freeze! Sheriff's Department!

01:23:45.377 --> 01:23:46.837
I live across the street!

01:23:47.553 --> 01:23:50.586
Paid cash! They the ones you want!

01:23:50.655 --> 01:23:53.850
- Problem, officers?
- Don't move!

01:23:53.919 --> 01:23:56.439
- Make a damn hole!
- Hey, brother, man!

01:23:56.511 --> 01:23:58.812
Y'all can't fuck with the police.

01:23:58.878 --> 01:24:01.299
Y'all can't fuck with the police.

01:24:04.509 --> 01:24:08.469
Rude-ass cops.
You done paid your parking tickets?

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:10.484
You still got your illegal cable?

01:24:10.555 --> 01:24:12.978
We better get the hell outta here.

01:24:13.052 --> 01:24:16.436
- Come here, Cheeco!
- Get your hands off me!

01:24:16.508 --> 01:24:20.763
- This is like a bad dream.
- Why you cops got to be so violent?

01:24:23.195 --> 01:24:24.920
I love Fridays.

01:24:26.171 --> 01:24:28.922
It ain't over, punk!
Wait till I get out!

01:24:31.835 --> 01:24:34.421
- When you get out?
- I'm gonna beat your butt up too.

01:24:36.444 --> 01:24:38.298
- It ain't over!
- Come on, man!

01:24:38.363 --> 01:24:41.973
- Good job. Good job.
- Yeah, that's our pump!

01:24:42.041 --> 01:24:43.700
Shut up!

01:24:44.731 --> 01:24:46.835
That's right.

01:24:46.907 --> 01:24:48.761
Look what I got.

01:24:49.978 --> 01:24:51.865
Wait, man. Don't open that here.

01:24:55.672 --> 01:24:57.777
- Jump up and down on that back of his.
- That's next.

01:24:57.848 --> 01:24:59.475
Don't listen to him.

01:24:59.544 --> 01:25:03.440
Cash make the coochie go whoo-whoo.

01:25:03.512 --> 01:25:07.768
It's gonna feel real good
to pay my taxes. Thanks, nephew.

01:25:07.833 --> 01:25:09.654
No problem, Unc.

01:25:11.448 --> 01:25:13.486
All done!

01:25:13.559 --> 01:25:15.698
Thanks, Miss Kym.

01:25:15.768 --> 01:25:18.385
- Call me, man.
- All right.

01:25:22.838 --> 01:25:25.010
Ancient Chinese secret.

01:25:25.077 --> 01:25:27.501
I'm Korean, motherfucker.

01:25:27.575 --> 01:25:31.054
Fat-ass little Chinese lady's gonna
take the money and not give me no play?

01:25:32.438 --> 01:25:34.894
Will you get your broke-down ass up?

01:25:34.964 --> 01:25:37.300
There ain't nothin' wrong with you.
Layin' down like a broke-dick dog.

01:25:37.365 --> 01:25:40.234
Get up. Come on.
What's wrong with you?

01:25:41.974 --> 01:25:44.841
Damn! That
George Jefferson shit works!

01:25:44.917 --> 01:25:46.126
Walk me to the door.

01:25:47.892 --> 01:25:50.706
Hey. Wait a minute.

01:25:50.772 --> 01:25:53.073
I'm sure gonna miss you.

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:55.561
Why don't you give
your Auntie Suga some sugar?

01:25:56.403 --> 01:25:57.833
Give me a kiss.

01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:01.517
- Hey!
- Come here.

01:26:04.947 --> 01:26:06.319
Sorry.

01:26:11.537 --> 01:26:13.839
Nephew, you're welcome here anytime.

01:26:16.144 --> 01:26:18.284
Thanks again.

01:26:18.354 --> 01:26:22.030
She's always hittin' on somebody.
Man, you sure you don't wanna stay?

01:26:22.097 --> 01:26:25.992
You know I got to live ghetto fabulous.
I can't stay here with y'all fools.

01:26:26.063 --> 01:26:29.195
- It's too crazy around here.
- Yeah, it's thugged out.

01:26:29.264 --> 01:26:31.303
But you keep that car.
You make sure you get that fixed.

01:26:31.376 --> 01:26:33.831
- You know that. I got money now.
- Yeah, I see.

01:26:33.904 --> 01:26:35.758
When can I come to see you
and fuck your neighborhood up?

01:26:35.823 --> 01:26:37.709
- You can't.
- All right.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.373
Fuck his shit up.
Go on, girl. Hurry up.

01:26:49.005 --> 01:26:50.118
Get that shit.

01:26:52.878 --> 01:26:54.470
Hurry up!

01:26:57.357 --> 01:27:01.634
<i>Oh, well. All is well
that ends well, of course.</i>

01:27:01.710 --> 01:27:04.807
<i>Another Friday gone,
another problem solved.</i>

01:27:05.676 --> 01:27:09.451
<i>It's a trip to know that things
can get wild in the suburbs too.</i>

01:27:09.517 --> 01:27:12.233
<i>Man, I can't wait
to get back home...</i>

01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:15.147
<i>to the peace and
quiet streets of South Central.</i>

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:16.579
<i>Yeah.</i>
