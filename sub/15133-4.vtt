19:02.992 --> 19:04.692
I can't run forever.

19:04.727 --> 19:07.278
And I can't stand
seeing your career,

19:07.313 --> 19:08.479
your reputation destroyed

19:08.514 --> 19:09.914
because you fell
for the wrong guy.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.050
You're not
the wrong guy.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.118
Stay here.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.720
We can talk
about all of this tomorrow.

19:15.754 --> 19:19.891
We can figure it out.

19:19.925 --> 19:23.528
Just come to bed.

19:24.797 --> 19:28.182
Okay.

19:33.472 --> 19:38.359
I've had successes,
I've had flops,

19:38.410 --> 19:39.744
but I've never had my name
on something

19:39.778 --> 19:41.763
I didn't believe in.

19:41.797 --> 19:43.564
Even my Mustang commercial

19:43.599 --> 19:45.867
had more of me in it
than this does.

19:45.901 --> 19:48.953
Hey, I'm talking to you.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.538
No, you're talking at me,

19:50.572 --> 19:52.623
like you always do
when you know you're wrong.

19:52.641 --> 19:54.058
What, you think
I'm wrong

19:54.093 --> 19:55.443
for demanding
a certain standard?

19:55.477 --> 19:57.845
To you,
this is just a concert.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.580
You'll move on
to other shows.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.016
This is Ronnie's life.

20:02.051 --> 20:05.320
She wants to grow,
but she's scared.

20:06.588 --> 20:09.090
Okay.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.792
What should I do?

20:10.826 --> 20:13.494
Just let her sing
whatever the hell she wants.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.747
Derek, Derek.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.165
You got to hear this song.
It'll break your heart.

20:17.199 --> 20:18.482
It's simple.
It's pure.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.740
It's Broadway,
but a fresh take.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.136
Yeah, well,
slight change of program.

20:22.187 --> 20:24.455
I don't need it, so...

20:24.490 --> 20:29.160
I am going to give the people
what they want.

20:29.194 --> 20:31.546
No fresh take required.

20:31.580 --> 20:32.730
I'm sorry,
what are you saying?

20:32.765 --> 20:34.115
You're not going to listen
to the song?

20:34.149 --> 20:35.466
I've got a show
to direct, all right?

20:35.501 --> 20:36.601
No, dude,
you're gonna hear it.

20:36.635 --> 20:38.569
I mean, that's the least
you could do.

20:38.603 --> 20:40.455
Jimmy, calm down. He's just
been working really hard.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.973
Don't speak for me.

20:42.007 --> 20:44.108
If I'm gonna get screwed by
someone, it's not gonna be you.

20:44.143 --> 20:45.109
Okay,
if this is how he behaves

20:45.144 --> 20:46.527
when he doesn't get his way,

20:46.562 --> 20:47.478
hit list is very unlikely
to happen.

20:47.513 --> 20:48.513
Hey, it isn't about that.

20:48.514 --> 20:51.382
Just hear the song,
Derek.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.577
I gave it
everything I've got.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.885
Give me five minutes,
I deserve that.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.422
No, no one deserves anything
in this business!

20:57.456 --> 21:00.258
You wait your turn,
and you earn it.

21:02.878 --> 21:05.847
You are not there yet.

21:05.881 --> 21:07.365
Seriously?

21:07.399 --> 21:09.016

21:09.051 --> 21:11.402
It's all right, darling.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.722

21:24.983 --> 21:27.568
I have a show to do.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.620
You're not staying?

21:29.655 --> 21:31.789
- Jimmy...
- You know what?

21:31.824 --> 21:34.058
I'm out of here.

21:41.874 --> 21:42.891
Kyle, it's me.

21:42.925 --> 21:43.976
I just wanted
to check on Jimmy,

21:44.010 --> 21:45.711
see how he's doing.
Is he there?

21:45.745 --> 21:47.479
No, he's not here.

21:48.003 --> 21:49.253
In fact,
I have no idea where he is.

21:49.288 --> 21:50.838
I gave up looking for him
around 5:00.

21:50.856 --> 21:52.306
He's been gone
all night?

21:52.324 --> 21:54.408
Look, Karen,
you're a really nice person,

21:54.443 --> 21:56.177
and it's great that you're
trying to help us and stuff,

21:56.195 --> 21:57.829
but there's a lot
you don't know, okay?

21:57.880 --> 21:59.514
Jimmy's got a trigger,

21:59.548 --> 22:01.816
and when it gets pulled,
he disappears.

22:01.850 --> 22:03.450
Sometimes for hours,
sometimes days.

22:03.469 --> 22:05.153
Well, let me help you
look for him.

22:05.187 --> 22:06.988
I got to go.

22:07.022 --> 22:10.324
Kyle?

22:10.359 --> 22:11.909
Just continue on the path
that we've been on...

[Indistinct chatter]

Thanks, man.

22:13.996 --> 22:15.913
See you.
Good work.

22:17.966 --> 22:19.317
Not bad.

22:19.351 --> 22:21.602
No. Awful!

22:21.636 --> 22:22.787
<i>The singing bird.</i>

22:22.821 --> 22:25.006
I thought the title
was a metaphor, but no.

22:25.040 --> 22:29.126
It's actually
about a bird that sings,

22:29.161 --> 22:32.330
and you have the <i>gall</i>
to tell me how to write?

22:32.364 --> 22:34.565
You think I don't know
my play is bad?

22:34.600 --> 22:35.716
My play is terrible.

22:35.734 --> 22:37.351
Oh, no,
I'm not falling for that.

22:37.369 --> 22:39.486
I don't even own
a copy myself.

22:39.505 --> 22:42.940
I suck at writing,
but I am a really great teacher.

22:42.975 --> 22:44.358
No, you're not.

22:44.376 --> 22:45.877
If you were, your students
would have given me

22:45.928 --> 22:47.345
a standing "O"
instead of the hook.

22:47.379 --> 22:48.863
I thought
if you heard it yourself...

22:48.897 --> 22:51.816
No more games, Peter.

22:51.850 --> 22:54.168
I suggest things,
and you start bantering,

22:54.186 --> 22:56.003
which is your way
of not really listening to me.

22:56.038 --> 22:57.255
- I don't do that.
- Yes, you do.

22:57.289 --> 22:58.506
- No, I don't.
- You're doing it right now.

22:58.540 --> 23:01.409
No, I'm not.
Yes, I am. Oh, my God.

23:04.913 --> 23:06.981
I want <i>Bombshell</i> to be great.
I do.

23:07.015 --> 23:08.699
I just...

23:08.734 --> 23:12.503
I just wish
I knew what was wrong.

23:15.674 --> 23:18.159
They're from <i>The Wiz</i> producers.

23:18.193 --> 23:22.647
Ah, "we wish you
all the best tonight."

23:22.681 --> 23:24.916
That's code
for "let's talk."

23:24.950 --> 23:26.717
Oh, those network folks,
they're going to be coming too.

23:26.752 --> 23:28.703
They're going to want
to take you out after.

23:28.737 --> 23:30.588
I know you're gonna want
to hang out with the ensemble,

23:30.622 --> 23:33.090
but you can do that
some other day.

23:33.125 --> 23:35.076
Yeah, definitely.

23:37.045 --> 23:39.046
Honey...

23:39.064 --> 23:41.699
You're not letting
Derek get to you, are you?

23:41.750 --> 23:43.885
He doesn't know me.

23:43.919 --> 23:46.037
I'm not just
a good girl.

23:46.071 --> 23:49.974
Ah, but the good girl
is what the people want to see,

23:50.008 --> 23:52.760
and you, my dear,
must play to your strengths.

23:52.794 --> 23:56.464
Oh, mm!
Baby.

23:56.498 --> 24:01.101
If my mother loved me
half as much as I love you...

24:03.555 --> 24:06.490
Maybe my singing wouldn't have
stopped at church,

24:06.525 --> 24:09.594
but this concert
and this bravo deal,

24:09.628 --> 24:11.412
they are the steps
that you need

24:11.430 --> 24:16.300
to move beyond Broadway,
just what you wanted.

24:16.335 --> 24:18.636
Sometimes I feel like
I don't remember what I wanted.

24:18.670 --> 24:21.489
And that's why I'm here,

24:21.523 --> 24:23.391
to remind you.

24:23.425 --> 24:27.461
Now is not the time
to go changing things.

24:27.496 --> 24:30.464
Okay, so we'll transition
from <i>A sleepin' bee</i>

24:30.498 --> 24:32.199
into <i>If I loved you.</i>

24:32.234 --> 24:34.535
Uh huh.

24:34.569 --> 24:37.154
And <i>Ease on down the road</i>
will lead into...

24:37.189 --> 24:38.940
Yep.

24:38.974 --> 24:40.841
Will lead into
<i>I could've danced all night.</i>

24:40.843 --> 24:42.643
Right.

24:42.678 --> 24:45.696
What is the matter
with you?

24:45.731 --> 24:47.832
Nothing.
I'm fine.

24:47.866 --> 24:49.106
Yeah, well,
you're obviously not

24:49.117 --> 24:51.185
because you're being
passive-aggressive.

24:51.219 --> 24:54.639
I prefer you
aggressive-aggressive, as usual.

24:54.690 --> 24:58.109
You made a mistake not
listening to that kid's song.

24:58.143 --> 24:59.627
Oh, yeah? Well, in case
you hadn't noticed,

24:59.661 --> 25:01.228
Ronnie and her shy
and impartial mother

25:01.263 --> 25:02.380
have a very clear direction

to go in.

25:04.433 --> 25:07.118
I've never seen you cave
before.

25:07.169 --> 25:10.638
And it turns out, when you cave,
I like you even less.

to go in there like this?

29:36.153 --> 29:39.906
You think that this shows
that I can handle it?

29:39.940 --> 29:43.492
You're learning.
You're getting a thicker skin.

29:43.527 --> 29:46.913
I was waiting out here
for you.

29:46.964 --> 29:50.833
You were?

29:50.867 --> 29:54.353
I'm so glad you showed.

30:04.231 --> 30:07.717
Wow.

30:07.751 --> 30:10.436
Wow, and I'm not just saying
that because I'm rolling.

30:10.470 --> 30:12.638
[Laughs]

30:12.689 --> 30:17.726
Let's... let's try that again
sometime when you're not high.

30:19.562 --> 30:22.048
Come on.

30:25.085 --> 30:27.136
So this is your fix?

30:27.170 --> 30:29.938
Getting drunk at noon
on a weekday?

30:29.957 --> 30:32.959
Well, I was just vamping.

30:33.010 --> 30:35.895
I really didn't have
anything.

30:35.946 --> 30:38.981
What if I don't have
anything either?

30:39.016 --> 30:41.117
Define "anything."

30:41.151 --> 30:45.454
Like the talent to write
something that counts.

30:45.489 --> 30:48.758
You have written lots
of things that count, Julia.

30:48.792 --> 30:51.310
I've seen them all.

30:52.929 --> 30:54.430
That student of yours?

30:54.464 --> 30:55.631
Give her a gold star.

30:55.666 --> 30:56.782
[Laughs]

30:56.833 --> 30:58.451
She hit the nail
on the head.

30:58.502 --> 31:00.970
I keep writing men
better than the woman,

31:01.004 --> 31:03.105
which is so strange,

31:03.140 --> 31:08.160
because Marilyn is
who I'm most captivated by,

31:08.211 --> 31:10.997
just like they were,
I guess.

31:11.031 --> 31:14.550
Wait, say that again.

31:14.568 --> 31:16.885
I forgot what I said.

31:16.903 --> 31:19.322
You basically said Marilyn
was defined by men.

31:19.356 --> 31:21.891
- Mm-hmm.
- Then you said...

31:21.925 --> 31:24.794
I identified with them.

31:26.262 --> 31:27.646
Oh, my God.

31:27.698 --> 31:30.416
- DiMaggio, Miller...
- Mm hmm.

31:30.467 --> 31:31.717
- Zanuck...
- Yes!

31:31.752 --> 31:36.572
J.F.K.,
even her therapist.

31:36.606 --> 31:38.741
When she sings
<i>Don't forget me,</i>

31:38.775 --> 31:40.275
that's who she's singing to...

31:40.293 --> 31:42.511
[Laughing]
And I didn't even...

31:42.546 --> 31:45.281
I didn't even realize it.

31:45.315 --> 31:48.350
I've been trying to make
the show about Marilyn,

31:48.368 --> 31:52.705
when it's really
about how men saw her.

31:52.756 --> 31:54.256
[Gasps]

31:54.291 --> 31:57.193
Every scene should be
from a man's point of view.

31:57.227 --> 31:58.894
Oh.

31:58.928 --> 32:00.896
She didn't have a voice.

32:00.930 --> 32:04.533
They all spoke for her.

32:04.568 --> 32:05.934
You know what?

32:05.952 --> 32:07.953
Let's start with
her first husband Jim dougherty,

32:08.004 --> 32:10.056
go from there.

32:12.759 --> 32:14.360
How'd it go today?

32:14.394 --> 32:17.980
Very well.

32:17.998 --> 32:20.883
Nick turned himself in.

32:20.917 --> 32:23.786
He told the feds
I had absolutely no idea

32:23.820 --> 32:26.405
where the money came from.

32:26.456 --> 32:28.374
So you're back
in business.

32:28.408 --> 32:30.042
I went in anyway.

32:30.093 --> 32:32.494
- I told them I knew.
- Why?

32:32.512 --> 32:33.796
Eileen!

32:33.830 --> 32:35.314
Because unlike you, Jerry,

32:35.348 --> 32:37.450
I care what happens
to the people I love.

32:37.484 --> 32:40.753
Nick was only doing
what he thought might help me,

32:40.787 --> 32:42.204
and they needed
to know that.

32:42.239 --> 32:43.772
And <i>Bombshell?</i>

32:43.790 --> 32:45.607
They're letting you keep it.

32:45.625 --> 32:48.661
Not exactly.

32:48.712 --> 32:50.679
Five minutes
to show-time, people.

32:50.714 --> 32:52.214
That's a fast five minutes.

32:52.249 --> 32:53.409
- What are you wearing?
- Mom.

32:53.417 --> 32:56.001
What has he talked you into?

32:56.052 --> 32:58.220
If I'm gonna give up
a real life for this,

32:58.255 --> 33:00.172
I'm going to love it.

33:00.223 --> 33:02.708
When I see Derek's work,
I love it, mom.

33:02.759 --> 33:04.844
I hope you do too.
<i>Places, please.</i>

33:04.878 --> 33:07.179

33:07.214 --> 33:08.330
