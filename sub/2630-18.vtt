WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:04.545
- Pick a card.
- Okay.

00:05.088 --> 00:07.715
All right. Now memorize it.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.216
- You got it?
- Oh, yes.

00:09.384 --> 00:12.302
Okay. Is that your card?

00:16.140 --> 00:17.558
- Yes.
- Ha, ha.

00:20.478 --> 00:22.813
- Hey, guys.
- Hi there.

00:23.940 --> 00:27.568
Guess what.
Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.654
- What are you talking about?
- Well, it's not for sure.

00:30.822 --> 00:34.700
But, uh, we met this guy in the park
who thought Ben was really cute.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.370
You know, which he is.
Um, anyhoo, he gave us his card...

00:38.538 --> 00:41.874
...and told us to bring him down
for this commercial he's auditioning.

00:42.792 --> 00:43.792
Whoa.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.628
The guy's like the biggest commercial
casting director in town.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.716
Ben takes one lousy walk
in the park and gets an audition?

00:53.720 --> 00:56.013
I mean, way to go, Ben!

00:58.224 --> 01:02.227
Man, I've been in that park a million times.
No one's ever offered me an audition.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.980
I know, it's crazy.
We were just pushing Ben on the swings...

01:05.147 --> 01:07.566
I'm always on the swings.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.444
What am I doing wrong?

01:11.404 --> 01:12.780
That.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.042
- Okay, gotta go. Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.378
Hey, Rach, now that you working at
Ralph Lauren, can you get me some shirts?

02:10.547 --> 02:13.465
Uh, well, you know what? I don't know
if I'd feel comfortable stealing...

02:13.633 --> 02:15.634
...on my very first day.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.804
Unwilling to steal from work.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.556
Interesting.

02:20.723 --> 02:23.225
Besides, if anybody is gonna get free stuff,
it's me.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.769
Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.480
- Go get them.
- Bye.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.691
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.193
I say we throw
a surprise party this weekend.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.737
Whoa, whoa. But her birthday's
not for another month.

02:35.905 --> 02:39.199
Okay, but if we throw her a party
on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.

02:40.952 --> 02:44.580
I think that's a great idea. We can have
a dinner party and invite her close friends.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.082
Ross. We're having
a surprise party for Rachel.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.710
- Okay.
- Done.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.463
Okay, great.
So do you wanna do it together?

02:53.756 --> 02:55.424
I would love to do it together.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.680
They're gonna do it together.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.599
Dude, that's my girlfriend.

03:03.766 --> 03:05.475
So I gotta shut it down now?

03:07.979 --> 03:10.105
All right, I gotta take off.
I'm picking up Ben...

03:10.273 --> 03:12.649
...and then we're off to the big audition.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.903
It's gonna be weird seeing some actor
pretending to be Ben's dad.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.655
- Yeah.
- Weirder than his two moms making out?

03:20.992 --> 03:23.327
Whoa, whoa. Dad? There's a dad
in the commercial?

03:23.494 --> 03:26.830
Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup
and pretend to enjoy it.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.791
Well, maybe I'll go with you
and see if I can audition as the dad.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.419
I mean, who better to play Ben's father
than his godfather?

03:32.587 --> 03:35.214
- You're not his godfather.
- What?

03:36.549 --> 03:37.966
Are you kidding?

03:40.011 --> 03:41.094
Of course I am.

03:43.139 --> 03:46.475
- Okay, let's go, godfather.
- All right. Ha, ha.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.442
Hey, I'm in.
They're gonna let me audition.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.152
Really? That's great.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.697
I know, I know. One of the casting ladies
has actually seen me in a play.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.699
So I steered clear of her.

04:04.452 --> 04:06.453
- That kid looks familiar.
- Oh, yeah.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.121
Yeah, he's done tons of commercials.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.540
I've seen him in Sugar Smacks,
PlayStation...

04:10.833 --> 04:12.334
...and that one for the phone company.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.002
In fact, he was so good in that one...

04:14.170 --> 04:16.797
...he actually convinced me
to switch phone companies.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.591
Chandler was mad.

04:20.176 --> 04:23.804
Yeah, well, he's not gonna get this one.
All right? Ben is way cuter than that kid.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.222
I mean, look at him.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.563
That's great.

04:33.731 --> 04:36.275
Listen, wouldn't it be great
if I got to play Ben's dad?

04:36.442 --> 04:37.943
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.655
I look more like him than you do.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.327
Well, I really don't know you
well enough for you to do that.

04:52.250 --> 04:56.378
So it's down to these two.
Nancy, I know you like this one...

04:56.546 --> 04:59.089
...and I think I agree.
Rachel, what do you think?

04:59.257 --> 05:01.425
Well, um, that one is pretty...

05:01.592 --> 05:05.512
...but I just love this fabric. Sorry.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.390
Oh, don't be. That's part of your job here,
to give your opinions.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.852
And then I take credit for them.
I'm kidding. Ha, ha.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.105
She is kidding. But don't ever
disagree with her again.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.441
- Okay, now I'm kidding.
- Oh, ha, ha.

05:17.608 --> 05:19.693
Oh, what a fun office.

05:20.945 --> 05:24.239
I don't know which one.
But I do know I need a cigarette.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.408
So, what do you say we take a break,
go outside...

05:26.576 --> 05:28.243
...and figure this out when we come back.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.706
- Rachel?
- Yeah.

05:32.874 --> 05:33.874
- You smoke?
- No.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.919
My dad's a doctor. And he would
always tell me just horror stories...

05:40.465 --> 05:44.092
About ghosts and goblins...

05:44.469 --> 05:49.139
...who totally supported
the princess' right to smoke.

05:55.271 --> 05:56.772
And then they came back
from smoking...

05:56.939 --> 05:59.316
...and they'd made all of the decisions
without me.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.151
- That doesn't seem fair.
- I know.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.988
It's like I'm being punished for not having
this disgusting, poisonous habit.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.990
Yeah, it is the best.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.202
I mean, what if this keeps happening?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.704
They'll be outside smoking,
making all the decisions...

06:12.872 --> 06:17.250
...and I'll just be up in my office
breathing in my stupid clean air.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.961
You know? And when Kim wants
to promote one of us...

06:20.129 --> 06:23.548
...who do you think she's gonna pick?
Me or Smokey Smokerson?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.551
Rachel, you can go down there,
you don't have to smoke.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.970
Just say you wanna get some fresh air.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.015
Yeah, I could do that.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.768
Yeah, or you could just do
the easy thing and smoke.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.438
- Hey. Do you wanna go get coffee?
- Hey.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.482
- Oh, I would love to.
- Oh, good.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.901
- I'm gonna go too, babe.
- Oh, good.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.278
- Yay.
- Yay.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.489
Oh, I changed my mind.

06:50.368 --> 06:53.161
Okay, let's talk about the party.
I have so many ideas.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.789
- Ooh, me too.
- Oh!

06:56.332 --> 06:58.750
- Yeah!
- Oh, look at that.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.629
- All right. This is a little sketch of the cake.
- Uh-huh. Wow.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.340
See? Um, some sample menus.

07:05.508 --> 07:08.468
Um, you know, I thought we'd start with
a Tuscan-style finger food.

07:08.636 --> 07:12.931
Okay. And for music, here's an
alphabetized list of all of my CDs.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.309
I've highlighted the ones
that'll go really good with the food.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.396
- What happened to the dinner party?
- We're not doing that.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.274
- Okay? So...
- Wow. All right.

07:22.442 --> 07:26.069
Looks like you took care of
everything. Thanks a lot, cohost.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.363
Wait. I didn't take care of everything.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.198
There's plenty of things for you to do.

07:30.366 --> 07:32.075
Uh-huh? Like what?

07:33.161 --> 07:34.578
Cups.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.080
Cups. You're giving me cups?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.541
And ice.

07:40.334 --> 07:43.420
Cups and ice? Oh, I get to be
in charge of cups and ice?

07:43.588 --> 07:45.172
All right.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.009
Fine. Okay, I will be in charge
of cups and ice.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.511
- Wait, I can get ice at the restaurant...
- I got it.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.557
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:55.725 --> 07:59.144
- How did the audition go?
- Not so good.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.731
Wait a minute. Are you doing Joey's:

08:02.899 --> 08:06.943
"The audition didn't go so well.
Yeah, it did!"

08:08.696 --> 08:09.738
Yeah, I am!

08:12.450 --> 08:15.118
- Yeah, Ben got a second audition.
- Oh, great.

08:15.286 --> 08:20.123
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit
because I actually didn't get a callback.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.210
You got a callback too, didn't you?

08:25.171 --> 08:27.547
Yeah, I did!

08:32.428 --> 08:34.846
Hey, Rachel.
What are you doing out here?

08:35.014 --> 08:39.351
You know, it got kind of lonely up there,
so I just thought I would come out here...

08:39.519 --> 08:41.977
...and get some fresh air.

08:42.145 --> 08:44.105
We were talking about
the fall collection.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.483
- Oh, great.
- So anyway, we really...

08:47.068 --> 08:49.986
- I'm sorry. We're smoking all over you.
- That's okay.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.780
No, no, no. We'll move. You stay there.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.408
I sent the designs to Ralph.
He was excited about it.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.328
That's great. You are the best.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.665
Excuse me. Can I bum one of those?

09:01.832 --> 09:03.250
Actually, this one's...

09:05.920 --> 09:08.630
Okay, okay, okay.
What's so funny over here?

09:08.798 --> 09:10.840
I thought you didn't smoke.

09:11.008 --> 09:15.845
You know, I thought you guys
meant marijuana cigarettes.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.932
You know what I mean? Like, doobies?

09:21.060 --> 09:24.229
Actually, I thought to myself,
"Those guys are crazy."

09:24.397 --> 09:26.898
But no, actually, I smoke
the regular ones all the time.

09:27.900 --> 09:28.942
We get high.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.321
Me too.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.658
- I'm kidding.
- Oh!

09:36.993 --> 09:38.702
Me too.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.958
Oh, God. This is so nerve-racking.
How do you do this?

09:45.126 --> 09:48.128
Well, fortunately,
I don't get many callbacks so...

09:49.046 --> 09:51.715
Is it a good sign that they asked us
to hang around after?

09:51.882 --> 09:53.508
Who knows?

09:55.219 --> 10:01.224
Okay. We have narrowed it down
to Raymond, Ben, Kyle and Joey.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.976
The rest of you, thank you very much.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.520
Yes! I knew it!

10:05.896 --> 10:08.398
Ah. Bye-bye.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.443
So long.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.403
Later.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.824
This is great.
I might actually get to play Ben's dad.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.243
Actually, that can't happen.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.412
Because you all have
such different looks...

10:22.580 --> 10:25.665
...we're putting you with Raymond
and Kyle with Ben.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.585
So it'll either be you two or you two.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.796
Oh, man.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.508
- This is gonna be kind of weird.
- Yeah, it is.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.720
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.

10:40.514 --> 10:44.142
No. We're like best friends.
That's why it's weird.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.644
Oh, oh.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.355
I thought we were just talking.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.237
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:56.405 --> 10:59.824
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here
till Rachel's birthday party?

10:59.992 --> 11:03.078
- Uh, sure. What's in them?
- Um, cups.

11:03.788 --> 11:07.082
Oh, good, because we got Rachel
800 gallons of water.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.210
Seriously, that's a lot of cups.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.295
Yeah, well, I'm in charge of cups and ice.

11:12.505 --> 11:16.383
And Monica's gonna rue the day
that she put me in charge of cups and ice.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.930
You know, I rued the day once.
Didn't get a whole lot else done.

11:23.182 --> 11:26.226
Okay, time to bring up
the rest of the cups.

11:28.145 --> 11:30.730
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.858
- Hey.
- Ross, good, I'm glad you're here.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.445
- I want to talk to you about something.
- Oh. What's up?

11:37.613 --> 11:40.990
Well, I've been thinking about
this whole commercial thing.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.367
You know me against Ben.

11:42.535 --> 11:47.288
The two of us competing.
Well, that can't lead to anything good.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.083
I think I'm just gonna step aside.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.961
I'm gonna tell them
that I won't audition.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.213
Wow. Uh...

11:55.381 --> 11:58.466
Joey, that's great. Thanks, man.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.681
That's it?

12:05.975 --> 12:09.227
You're gonna let me do this?
This is my career we're talking about here.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.520
But you just...

12:10.688 --> 12:13.356
I just said that
so you wouldn't let Ben do it.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.818
Look, Ross, if anyone should step aside,
it should be Ben.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.611
- What?
- Chandler, tell him.

12:21.657 --> 12:24.492
Well, let me get the door first.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.871
Oh, hi, no one.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.876
Why should Ben step aside?

12:33.043 --> 12:36.463
It was his audition in the first place.
You just tagged along.

12:36.630 --> 12:39.299
You're like the tag-along dad.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.176
At least I care about his feelings.

12:41.677 --> 12:42.719
What?

12:42.887 --> 12:45.722
Do you know how hard this is gonna be
on him when he doesn't get it?

12:46.182 --> 12:48.141
And why wouldn't he get it?

12:48.309 --> 12:50.185
Oh, come on.

12:50.352 --> 12:53.188
Have you seen what my kid can do?
Huh?

12:54.148 --> 12:56.649
I mean, he dials phones,
he eats tortilla chips.

12:56.817 --> 13:00.069
He plays soccer with the cartoon tiger.

13:00.571 --> 13:04.282
Are you saying your kid eats soup
better than my kid?

13:04.450 --> 13:07.243
You just give him a spoon, baby.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.746
- Oh, yeah? I guess we'll see.
- Yeah.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.998
Because this commercial belongs
to me and Mitch.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.919
- Your kid's name is Raymond.
- Yeah? So is yours.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.176
- How did work go?
- Oh, it was great. It was great.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.387
I went down there just like you said.
And we talked business.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.097
And Kim totally took my opinions.

13:28.682 --> 13:29.933
You stink.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.187
- Thanks.
- No, I'm serious.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.689
That's because I went down there
and they were smoking.

13:36.857 --> 13:39.442
This is actually the smell of success.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.403
But there's something different, though.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.280
Oh, my God. You smoked.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.408
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.203
You look happy and sick. You smoked.

13:51.038 --> 13:54.457
All right, fine. But I had to.
I had to do it for my career.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.418
I wish I had to smoke for my career.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.421
That's so gross.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.674
Well, no, it's not that bad, you know?

14:02.842 --> 14:07.720
I mean, yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy
and my fingers sort of smell.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.348
I actually feel like I could throw up.

14:11.225 --> 14:15.979
But you gotta push past this, okay?
Because it's about to get so good.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.189
Chandler.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.734
You smell so smoky, I gotta get up.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.736
I'm not kidding.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.114
I think you smell great.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.414
So we're decided.
No on plaid, yes on pink.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.082
Absolutely.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.793
I'm so on board.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.131
- Rachel, didn't you just light that?
- Yeah.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.424
But you know what?

14:44.592 --> 14:48.386
I'm just really, really
trying to cut back, you know.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.179
Good luck, Rach.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.183
I've actually been thinking
about quitting.

14:54.351 --> 14:56.811
Oh, well, sure. Every Sunday night,
I tell myself I'm quitting.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.022
Every Monday morning, it's like:

14:59.356 --> 15:00.523
Tell me about it.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.359
Well, let's quit. We'll just quit.
Let's all quit.

15:03.819 --> 15:04.944
It does sound appealing.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.864
- I never could do it.
- But you could. You can. Absolutely.

15:08.032 --> 15:11.075
We can help each other out.
We could get those patches.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.620
We could be like the Patch Sisters.

15:13.787 --> 15:17.332
You know, we really should quit.
Okay, let's quit.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.626
Yes. Great. Give me those cigs.
Come on.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.003
Give it. Give it. Out. Done. Quit. Whoo!

15:24.506 --> 15:27.759
- My late husband gave me that lighter.
- Ha, ha.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.345
I'm not kidding.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.597
Okay, then. Okay.

15:35.267 --> 15:44.067
Mm, soup.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.611
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.155
Would you mind watching Ben
while I use the ladies' room?

15:49.323 --> 15:50.531
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.118
Mm.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.835
Hi, Ben.

16:03.587 --> 16:07.465
So you want to be an actor, huh?
Well, I gotta tell you, it's no picnic.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.969
There's tons of rejection. No stability.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.931
I mean, one day,
you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.810
The next day, you're eating ketchup
right out of the bottle.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.939
Joey.

16:23.565 --> 16:24.983
Ross.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.736
Ben.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.030
I mean, Ben. Ben.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.908
Okay, Raymond, Joey, you're up.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.956
- Hi.
- Okay.

16:40.124 --> 16:43.501
All right, well, let's try one.
Whenever you guys are ready.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.963
- Uh-oh.
- Is there a problem?

16:47.131 --> 16:50.925
Well, this is noodle soup.
And I've been working with tomato.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.636
But that's okay.
No problem. No problem.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.014
Mm, noodle soup.

16:56.181 --> 16:59.559
You know, that's fine.
But the line is, "Mm, soup."

16:59.727 --> 17:02.687
- Oh. What'd I say?
- Mm, noodle soup.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.065
How's that different?

17:09.486 --> 17:11.695
Oh. Right. Yeah.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.074
All right. Let's try one.

17:18.619 --> 17:21.789
Mm, noodle soup.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.086
Okay. Let's do it again.

17:27.253 --> 17:28.588
Okay.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.468
Mm, soup.

17:33.635 --> 17:35.678
I mean, noodle soup. I mean, soup.

17:35.846 --> 17:36.846
Come on!

17:39.725 --> 17:42.018
You know what?
We need to move on.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.187
Oh, no, I could do it one more time.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.605
See, look.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.940
Mm, noodle soup.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.400
Damn it.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.870
Hey. Hey.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.955
Uh-oh. Busted.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.334
Come on, you guys. What are you doing?

18:06.502 --> 18:08.252
I thought we were the Patch Sisters.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.046
Yeah, that didn't work out.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.509
Rachel, we tried to quit.
But it was too hard.

18:14.676 --> 18:18.054
Well, if you started smoking again,
you could have at least told me.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.890
Come on, give me one of those.
What are we talking about?

18:21.058 --> 18:22.683
No, you're doing great. Don't give up.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.645
That's why we didn't tell you,
and we are not gonna drag you down.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.064
Oh, wait. No, no. Drag me down.
Drag me down.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.025
Forget it, Rachel. We're both so proud
of how well you're doing.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.487
I'm not gonna let you blow it.
In fact, if I catch you, you're fired.

18:34.655 --> 18:38.574
So go on, get out of here. Go on.
I don't want you breathing this stuff. Go on.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.452
So okay. So you'll come with me
on the Paris trip?

18:41.620 --> 18:43.412
Oh, man.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.754
Hey, check it out. Cup hat, cup banner...

18:51.922 --> 18:55.842
...cup chandelier and the thing
that started it all. The cup.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.512
- Great job with the cups, Pheebs.
- Ha, ha.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.306
Why don't you just go out with her?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.102
Did you notice the ice? Look.

19:06.270 --> 19:10.731
We have it all. We have crushed,
cubed and dry. Watch.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.525
Ah.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.027
Mystical.

19:19.908 --> 19:23.494
No one's eating my Tuscan finger food.
They're filling up on Phoebe's snow cones.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.288
There are snow cones?

19:25.455 --> 19:27.165
Snow cones. Yuck.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.959
- Go, go.
- Thank you. Thank you.

19:33.130 --> 19:36.299
- Look, look.
- Surprise.

19:36.466 --> 19:40.136
What? My birthday is not
for another month.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.513
That's the surprise.

19:43.765 --> 19:47.935
Oh, my God, you guys.
This is so great. It's so unexpected.

19:48.103 --> 19:51.314
I mean, Chandler's birthday's
even before mine.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.527
Surprise.

19:59.198 --> 20:03.451
Wow. This is so great.
Look at all these...

20:03.619 --> 20:06.662
...cups. This is so weird.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.081
I was in charge of cups.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.334
Oh, okay. Not so weird.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.464
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:16.632 --> 20:20.343
Listen, man. I'm sorry
the audition didn't go well.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.511
Yeah, right.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.473
No, really. I am, Joey. I feel bad.

20:25.641 --> 20:29.185
Well, look, Ross. You don't have to, okay?

20:29.353 --> 20:31.062
It's not your fault I suck.

20:31.230 --> 20:35.107
What kind of an actor can't even say,
"Mm, noodle soup"?

20:39.363 --> 20:44.367
Hey, you know what? Maybe you didn't
mess up your audition because you suck.

20:44.534 --> 20:49.664
Maybe you messed up because
you care more about your godson.

20:50.207 --> 20:53.542
- What do you mean?
- I think, subconsciously...

20:53.710 --> 20:55.294
Whoa, you lost me.

20:59.675 --> 21:03.636
I think, on some level, you sabotaged...

21:03.804 --> 21:07.848
...your own audition
so Ben would get the part.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.187
Well, your way sounds
a lot better than mine.

21:13.897 --> 21:15.481
Yeah.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.317
- Yeah. It's not that I'm a bad actor.
- No.

21:18.485 --> 21:22.571
No, it's just that, uh, I care
so damn much about little Ben...

21:22.739 --> 21:26.117
...that, uh, it was more important
for me to see him succeed.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.869
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.913
- So did he get it?
- No.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.456
Ah, what are you gonna do?

21:38.964 --> 21:42.258
Oh, hi. Excuse me. Is Rachel Green here?
I'm supposed to meet her for lunch.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.428
Oh, she doesn't come down anymore.
You can find her up on 10.

21:45.595 --> 21:47.013
Okay, great.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.141
So we talked
about the presentation at lunch.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.185
He wondered if one person would be
enough for me to take on the trip.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.813
And I said, "Yeah, absolutely."

22:00.986 --> 22:02.945
I'll catch you guys later.
