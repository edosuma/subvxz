00:58.641 --> 01:00.893
- Target four. Wanna take the other truck?
- Roger.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.145
- Move by the truck.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.063
Move in right there.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.942
Roger. He's wounded. Hit him.
Start hitting the truck.

01:09.110 --> 01:12.154
Get the truck and him.
Go forward of it and hit him.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.616
Roger.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.160
Go ahead and store that.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.870
Another guy moving right through.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.039
Good. Fire. Hit him.

01:45.647 --> 01:46.980
Get down on the floor.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.192
I said, down. Down.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.027
You. Down. Now.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.867
Let me see your hands.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.330
Get the hands over your head.
Over your head!

02:05.500 --> 02:07.000
Get down.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.047
On your knees.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.841
There. Stay there.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.887
Get your hands up.
Get your hands up.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.433
Get down.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.228
Shit, there's a kid in there.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.356
That's not our problem.

02:29.524 --> 02:30.858
None of this is our problem.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.651
Get your hands in the air.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.905
Hey.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.080
How's it going, little man?

02:47.542 --> 02:48.792
You all right?

02:57.051 --> 02:59.636
I was 27 years old the first time I died.

03:00.054 --> 03:02.598
I remember there was white everywhere.

03:02.765 --> 03:07.269
There was war, and I felt alive.
But, really, I was dead.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.732
- So how old?
- Twenty-seven.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.860
Here he is. Starks, Jack.

03:15.069 --> 03:18.572
Born in Vermont.
Hasn't got a family listed.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.158
Naval hospital will take care of it.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.081
Oh, my God.

03:28.249 --> 03:31.460
- This soldier's alive. This man just blinked.
- Been tagged already.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.338
- Worry about the others.
- No, no, look at this.

03:35.423 --> 03:39.676
Oh, shit. Code blue, code blue.
We need a doctor.

03:39.844 --> 03:42.512
Get a doctor over here now.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.851
Sergeant Starks was very lucky.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.479
A little more to the right,
it wouldn't have come out.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.357
He has retrograde amnesia,
acute psychological suppression.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.816
We couldn't find any family...

03:55.109 --> 03:56.443
...in the States, sergeant.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.404
- I'm sure you have friends.
- I want the paperwork this afternoon.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.574
- Get him on the next flight out of here.
- Yes, sir.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.495
He's recommended you for
the Bronze Star. Sergeant.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.998
- There is help for you, sergeant.
- Of course there is.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.334
Of course there is.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.972
You guys all right?

04:26.057 --> 04:29.226
- Our car won't start.
- That's your mom?

04:29.394 --> 04:32.020
- Yeah.
- What's your mom's name?

04:33.231 --> 04:34.731
Jean.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.692
Hey, Jean.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.153
Can you hear me?

04:42.699 --> 04:44.116
Can you wake up?

04:44.659 --> 04:46.827
I need you to try and stay awake.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.623
- Oh, God.
- Your mom taking anything?

05:01.342 --> 05:04.678
- What's your name?
- Jackie.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.973
Nice to meet you, Jackie.

05:08.599 --> 05:11.018
Tell you what. Why don't you do this.

05:11.185 --> 05:13.312
Wrap it around yourself...

05:13.521 --> 05:17.065
...and you try and keep your mom awake,
and I'll go work on your car.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.234
- All right?
- Okay.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.712
Oh, God.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.716
No. Oh, no...

05:48.890 --> 05:51.224
What do you think of all this snow?

05:51.726 --> 05:55.103
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

05:58.066 --> 05:59.399
What are these?

06:01.235 --> 06:05.447
Those are dog tags. See, they got the name
and the date of birth on them.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.575
- What for?
- In case I get lost...

06:09.452 --> 06:12.662
...or can't remember who I am.
- Can I have them?

06:14.415 --> 06:17.250
- Yeah, you can have them.
- Thanks.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.798
You think you can reach the ignition?

06:22.965 --> 06:25.300
Go ahead and give it a shot.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.263
Just keep turning, all right?

06:38.022 --> 06:39.773
Keep going.

06:41.692 --> 06:42.943
It works.

06:46.656 --> 06:52.577
Hey, get your fucking hands off...

06:52.745 --> 06:57.999
Get your fucking hands off my daughter.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter.

06:58.167 --> 07:03.255
- Mom, he fixed our car.
- Jackie, get in that car. Now.

07:03.464 --> 07:06.800
- Mom. He fixed the car.
- Get in the goddamn car!

07:53.055 --> 07:54.681
- How's it going?
- Pretty good, man.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.975
- Where you headed?
- On up in Canada.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.311
- I can take you to the border.
- That'd be great.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.230
- All right, bud, jump on in.
- It's freezing.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.734
- Hey, man.
- Hey. Thanks.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.736
Jump on in here. Hey, no problem.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.863
My God, it's cold.

08:10.031 --> 08:13.033
- Must've been freezing out there, boy.
- Yeah.

08:13.201 --> 08:18.538
It's colder than a witch's titty with
a brass bra on doing pushups in the snow.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.959
- So you drive?
- Yeah, sure.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.337
All right, man, great.
We'll switch up in a bit.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.927
You ever been to jail?

08:33.221 --> 08:36.181
- No, I've never been to jail.
- I'll tell you what, buddy...

08:36.390 --> 08:38.433
...it's a whole lot
goddamn worse than war.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.727
It's probably worse
than anywhere you been.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.604
I doubt that.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.358
Are you kidding me?

08:46.567 --> 08:49.277
What's he pulling us over for?

08:50.738 --> 08:52.906
Recreation.

08:56.577 --> 09:02.499
Jackie and Jean are the only things
you know for certain about that day?

09:02.667 --> 09:04.042
Yes.

09:04.210 --> 09:10.590
Are you aware that we have no last name,
no place of residence...

09:10.883 --> 09:17.097
...and no record of any physical
presence for these friends of yours?

09:20.685 --> 09:25.438
I'm afraid I might have to actually
hear that answer, Mr. Starks.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.817
Yes.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.987
Officer Harrison
had been shot three times.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.658
He was long dead
by the time we got there.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.785
Jack Starks could be
blocking the incident.

09:38.953 --> 09:42.581
It would explain his well-conceived plan
about the little girl and her mother.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.874
- Objection.
- I have heard of Gulf War syndrome.

09:45.042 --> 09:48.795
War is just a CNN special. Half the shit
that went on in Operation Desert Storm...

09:48.963 --> 09:52.007
...can't be tidied into
a top-of-the-hour headline.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.677
Couldn't be said neatly,
so couldn't be said at all.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.637
- There was someone else.
- War's ugly.

09:57.805 --> 10:01.766
- And they don't put ugly on TV.
- My client thinks he already died once.

10:01.976 --> 10:06.271
- I don't really remember all of it...
- He doesn't know what's going on.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.774
...but there was someone else.

10:10.818 --> 10:13.320
I think that's what happened.

10:13.487 --> 10:16.364
If Starks did kill that officer...

10:16.532 --> 10:19.284
...can't hold a man responsible
for a damaged mind.

10:19.452 --> 10:24.664
We, the jury, find the defendant
not guilty by reason of insanity.

10:25.291 --> 10:29.669
Jack Starks, I hereby sentence you
to be committed...

10:29.837 --> 10:32.505
...to an institution
for the criminally insane...

10:32.673 --> 10:36.635
...where I hope the doctors
and proper treatment can help you.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.470
Come on, bud.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.818
Come on.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.962
What are you doing?

12:52.354 --> 12:54.189
Get him up.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.327
Please believe...

13:49.537 --> 13:51.663
What are you doing? I don't belong here.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.667
- I don't belong here.
- No, I don't think you do either.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.545
But neither of us
can do anything about that now.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.052
Please. Please.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.830
Let me out of here.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.875
Let me out of here. Please.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.105
- How much did you give him?
- Fifty cc's.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.775
- And he's been in for the full three hours?
- Yes, sir.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.110
Okay, get him out.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.328
Jack, can you hear me?

15:59.667 --> 16:01.751
Jack, blink for me if you can.

16:08.550 --> 16:12.637
- He didn't lose consciousness.
- Do you wanna put him back in?

16:12.846 --> 16:14.555
No, take him out of it.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.684
Take him upstairs
and check his vitals every hour.

16:41.625 --> 16:45.378
Now that's, I think, the context
in which to view what's going on.

16:51.427 --> 16:56.305
Perhaps you may have seen a lead story
in The New York Times.

17:04.897 --> 17:07.150
Good morning, Dr. Lorenson.

17:13.406 --> 17:16.159
You're the cop killer, right?

17:18.412 --> 17:21.164
- That obvious, huh?
- TV, you know?

17:21.330 --> 17:24.291
Helps soothe an active mind.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.838
I'm Rudy Mackenzie. Welcome.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.174
Listen, I...

17:32.551 --> 17:35.595
- I don't really feel like talking.
- You know, that's a shame.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.889
I don't believe
in disposable language either.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.725
You know, small talk, little talk,
chitchat. Useless.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.519
The game.
The game's something else, though.

17:43.687 --> 17:49.859
This here is our court.
I'm ready to throw the ball. Come on.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.362
All right.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.364
What are you in here for?

17:57.785 --> 18:03.539
- I tried to kill my wife.
- Don't you go to jail for that?

18:03.707 --> 18:08.377
Yeah, well, I tried, like, 30 times.
I never planned on doing it, you know?

18:08.545 --> 18:11.089
It was always
in the heat of the moment.

18:11.298 --> 18:15.760
And she kept threatening
to have me put away until finally...

18:16.970 --> 18:18.179
...she did.

18:18.680 --> 18:23.518
- Thirty times might make you seem crazy.
- Yeah, or just... Or just plain stupid.

18:23.685 --> 18:28.272
Because you'd think by the 20th time,
I would've found an alternative method...

18:28.440 --> 18:33.528
...or maybe a more effective one.
- Morning, gentlemen. How you doing today?

18:33.695 --> 18:36.989
For me that is a really
difficult question, Dr. Lorenson...

18:37.157 --> 18:41.202
...because the world around me is shrinking,
and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse...

18:41.370 --> 18:44.413
...are coming to see me today,
and they're not bringing flowers...

18:44.581 --> 18:47.875
...which just makes it really difficult
to get organized.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.839
And you, Mr. Starks?

18:53.549 --> 18:56.801
- I'm fine.
- So you're okay?

18:58.512 --> 18:59.846
You tell me, doc.

19:01.765 --> 19:04.058
You think there's
something wrong with me?

19:05.185 --> 19:06.811
You're a little underweight.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.523
Maybe I'm working it off in my dreams.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.111
Done with the small talk?

19:23.579 --> 19:25.163
Hey, it's okay.

19:36.383 --> 19:39.886
Mr. Starks, glad to see
you're cooperating this time.

19:40.053 --> 19:43.556
We're here to help, Jack.
We're only doing what's best for you.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.230
Hold him while I get the tranquilizer.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.399
- Get him down. Fuck the tranquilizer.
- No.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.278
No, that's not necessary. Get him up.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.825
Nurse, get the jacket.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.828
The only thing
your mind's missing's a conscience.

20:07.247 --> 20:11.083
Wait. Dr. Becker, how long
do you want us to leave him in for?

20:11.251 --> 20:12.668
Just strap him in for now.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.812
Help. Help, please.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.566
Motherfucker.

20:38.278 --> 20:44.784
Let me out of here.

20:48.997 --> 20:51.499
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.839
- Listen, I hate to bother you.
- Then don't.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.883
But what about Starks?

21:01.843 --> 21:04.136
What about Starks?

21:04.638 --> 21:06.055
Should we be just...?

21:06.223 --> 21:09.934
Should we be trying to help him
any way we can?

21:10.102 --> 21:12.603
- Yes.
- Should we be leaving him in there like that?

21:12.813 --> 21:16.274
The medication I've given him
is intended to adjust...

21:16.483 --> 21:22.571
...maybe even reset, his violent proclivities.
Peel away some layers of hate.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.366
The apparatus is merely
a safe place for that to happen.

21:25.534 --> 21:30.454
The grounds and the halls, where I can't
monitor side effects I can't predict, aren't.

21:30.622 --> 21:33.582
But how can you be monitoring
the effects while he's in there?

21:33.750 --> 21:37.503
I consider the time he's spent
in there part of the treatment.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.510
You can't break something
that's already broken.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.286
I don't belong here.

22:12.706 --> 22:17.376
I can't breathe in here.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.796
I can't...

22:25.344 --> 22:28.846
I can't breathe in here.

22:35.395 --> 22:37.855
I'm gonna blow your head off.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.100
In case you hadn't figured,
it's Christmas Eve.

23:56.309 --> 23:58.644
You're never gonna get a cab here.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.688
Thanks.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.357
You got somewhere
you need to go?

24:06.027 --> 24:07.361
I'm not sure.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.114
Well, let me ask you that again.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.284
This time, look around
and consider your options.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.746
Have you got somewhere
you need to go?

24:19.708 --> 24:21.167
Yeah, I do.

24:21.751 --> 24:24.587
Well, great. Get in.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.761
So where can I take you?

24:33.805 --> 24:35.598
I don't know.

24:35.765 --> 24:39.268
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.938
Okay.

24:48.862 --> 24:53.324
Well, there must be
another shelter I can call.

24:55.869 --> 24:59.830
Yeah, well, thanks a lot.
Merry Christmas to you too.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.707
Great.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.335
That was our last option.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.507
What am I gonna do with you?

25:10.133 --> 25:11.800
Nothing.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.597
I'll...

25:17.015 --> 25:20.226
- Listen, thanks for bringing me this far.
- Where are you going?

25:20.727 --> 25:23.145
You'll freeze out there.
You don't even have a coat.

25:23.855 --> 25:27.525
- I'll manage.
- No, you won't.

25:27.943 --> 25:32.071
You'll die of cold,
and then I'll have to feel guilty.

25:32.239 --> 25:35.241
And I've already got more guilt
than I know what to do with.

25:35.408 --> 25:37.409
You want a drink?

25:37.577 --> 25:39.411
No, I'm okay.

25:45.418 --> 25:47.127
Shit.

26:07.023 --> 26:08.691
Hey.

26:09.734 --> 26:10.818
You okay?

26:12.362 --> 26:15.281
Yeah. I'm fine.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.459
You know what?

26:29.462 --> 26:31.755
It's Christmas Eve and...

26:33.508 --> 26:38.971
And I have a couch,
so you can stay on it.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.723
I'm gonna go take a bath.

26:41.808 --> 26:44.643
Fix yourself something to eat
if you're hungry or anything.

26:44.811 --> 26:48.147
There's nothing to steal, but don't be
a jerk and take something anyway.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.566
No. I wouldn't.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.446
- My name is Jack.
- No.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.324
Let's not do the name thing,
because it's...

26:58.617 --> 27:00.993
I don't wanna meet you.

27:01.161 --> 27:05.247
I may wanna help you tonight,
but I don't wanna know you, really.

27:08.918 --> 27:10.169
Okay.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.366
What's this?

28:24.244 --> 28:27.871
Best I could do
with what was in the fridge.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.090
Thanks.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.344
No problem.

28:46.599 --> 28:51.061
- You want a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

29:17.464 --> 29:20.007
It was pretty good, considering.

29:24.262 --> 29:29.266
Your fridge has quite an array of things.

29:29.976 --> 29:32.478
Not a lot of food, but...

29:32.645 --> 29:34.772
- Freezer has a rock in it.
- What rock?

29:34.981 --> 29:39.151
There was a stone in it. It said "petal."

29:40.111 --> 29:41.361
That's snooping.

29:48.495 --> 29:51.705
It was my mom's senseless idea
of a nickname.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.249
It's...

29:57.837 --> 30:01.298
So you're a waitress. I mean...

30:03.092 --> 30:04.843
I don't know what I mean.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.929
Okay.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.035
I hate Christmas.

32:30.406 --> 32:31.657
Hey.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.867
Hey, wake up. Jackie.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.161
- No.
- Who are these people?

32:36.329 --> 32:39.831
- What?
- Who are the people in this picture?

32:39.999 --> 32:41.333
That's my mom and me.

32:42.293 --> 32:44.753
- What do you mean, your mom and...?
- No, wait a minute.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.923
- Where's your mother now?
- My mom is dead.

32:48.091 --> 32:52.427
- What do you mean, she's dead?
- I mean, she's dead. Dead. Gone.

32:52.595 --> 32:56.682
She passed out with a cigarette and
burned to death a long time ago, all right?

32:57.016 --> 32:58.850
No, no, no...

32:59.435 --> 33:01.895
Listen, I'm sorry. Listen.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.691
I don't know how...

33:06.693 --> 33:08.944
- What's the date today?
- What?

33:09.237 --> 33:11.154
I know this sounds crazy.

33:12.365 --> 33:14.074
What year is this?

33:14.993 --> 33:16.201
2007.

33:16.744 --> 33:19.955
What? What?

33:22.250 --> 33:23.583
Who the hell are you?

33:26.337 --> 33:28.213
I'm Jack Starks.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.091
Get the fuck out of my house.

33:31.634 --> 33:33.802
- What'd you do, snoop all over the place?
- No.

33:33.970 --> 33:37.764
God, you had no right.
You had no right to go through anything.

33:38.474 --> 33:39.850
Look at me.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.937
I know this doesn't make any sense,
because it doesn't make sense to me either.

33:44.105 --> 33:47.190
Oh, my God. If you don't get out now,
I'm gonna call the cops.

33:47.400 --> 33:51.486
No, please. Please, wait.
I won't hurt you. Just talk to me, please.

33:51.654 --> 33:56.533
I... Your mom was passed out
on the side of the road when I met you.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.619
She was wasted.
Jean, her name was Jean.

33:59.787 --> 34:04.332
- Just stop it!
- Look, I gave this kid those dog tags.

34:04.500 --> 34:08.378
No, no. No, you didn't.

34:08.545 --> 34:12.424
Jack Starks did,
and Jack Starks is dead.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.926
What?

34:15.094 --> 34:16.969
What do you mean, he's...?

34:17.138 --> 34:18.722
He's dead.

34:18.931 --> 34:24.936
His body was found New Year's Day, 1993,
Alpine Grove.

34:25.103 --> 34:26.605
He's dead.

34:27.648 --> 34:31.275
- It can't be.
- Well, it is.

34:32.945 --> 34:37.199
Listen, listen. I don't care who
or where you think you are...

34:37.366 --> 34:38.909
...you're not Jack Starks.

34:39.077 --> 34:43.621
So whoever you are, I did a nice thing...
I did a really nice thing, and you've really...

34:43.790 --> 34:47.667
God, you've really made me regret it,
so please, please, would you...?

34:47.835 --> 34:49.628
Would you just leave? Okay?

34:50.045 --> 34:51.630
Don't you remember me?

34:51.797 --> 34:53.924
- Oh, my God.
- Look at me.

34:54.132 --> 34:58.678
I'll leave, okay, I'll leave, but look at me.
I'm not lying to you.

34:58.846 --> 35:05.227
I met you. I met you and your mother,
and there was no one around for miles.

35:05.394 --> 35:09.940
I couldn't have known that from a pair
of dog tags you had lying around.

35:12.652 --> 35:15.112
You put those down, and you get out.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.699
Don't you remember me?

35:19.867 --> 35:24.704
- Don't you know? I'm...
- You get out!

35:26.707 --> 35:28.416
I'm...

35:28.584 --> 35:30.502
Okay?

35:38.636 --> 35:40.220
Please.

35:41.347 --> 35:42.556
Please get out.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.578
I'm gonna blow your head off!

36:09.584 --> 36:12.043
Jackie.

36:13.337 --> 36:14.629
Oh, God.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.428
I can't believe you left him in all night.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.346
You didn't say anything when I asked...

36:23.514 --> 36:27.309
I expected some common sense
on your part. Open the drawer.

36:36.652 --> 36:38.320
Is he dead?

36:40.698 --> 36:44.618
No. Get him upstairs immediately.
He's dehydrated.

36:44.785 --> 36:46.912
I want him on an IV
by the time I get up there.

36:47.079 --> 36:49.456
I tried to tell you
when I came to your office...

36:49.624 --> 36:51.958
I expected you to take him out.

36:52.126 --> 36:57.088
You're a physician. I shouldn't have
to spell everything out for you.

37:07.350 --> 37:11.353
Jack?

37:17.443 --> 37:19.402
Tom.

37:19.570 --> 37:24.032
Tom, can I speak with you
for a moment, please?

37:28.829 --> 37:32.123
- What have you done with Jack Starks?
- What do you mean?

37:32.291 --> 37:35.502
- He's unconscious.
- He's recovering from Loxadol and Ativan.

37:35.670 --> 37:38.838
Loxadol? He didn't need neuroleptics.

37:39.006 --> 37:42.384
You know that from what, a couple
of two-minute stares across the room?

37:42.551 --> 37:45.345
He didn't need antipsychotics,
if that's all you gave him.

37:45.513 --> 37:48.890
After he attacked me,
I figured he'd need a little placating.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.017
You sure he wasn't provoked?

37:51.227 --> 37:53.687
Are you sure you wanna make
an accusation like that?

37:54.939 --> 37:58.858
I'm not making any accusations.
He's bruised up.

37:59.026 --> 38:01.278
Happens sometimes
when you gotta restrain them.

38:01.445 --> 38:04.030
Listen to me.
He is not gonna end up like Ted Casey.

38:04.240 --> 38:07.200
I don't know what you're trying to do,
but he's not a lab animal.

38:07.368 --> 38:10.120
You can't reprogram them,
no matter what cocktail of drugs...

38:10.288 --> 38:14.040
You really don't let up, do you?
Just because you failed Ted Casey...

38:14.208 --> 38:15.834
...doesn't mean the rest of us did.

38:17.378 --> 38:20.505
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's Christmas, remember?

38:38.149 --> 38:40.191
Hi, how are you? Sorry I'm late.

38:43.612 --> 38:46.698
- Hi, Babak.
- That's a nice wave.

38:47.366 --> 38:49.200
- Hey, Jamile.
- Hey.

38:52.121 --> 38:55.665
Okay, that's great. That was the truck.
Now point to the ball.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.297
Very good.

39:02.465 --> 39:07.469
Wanna hold it? Feels nice. Strong.

39:13.768 --> 39:17.479
I need you to stay with me
for just a little while more, okay?

39:26.655 --> 39:28.698
We'll get there.

39:30.659 --> 39:32.118
Could I have some water?

39:33.871 --> 39:36.539
Could I have some water?
I have some water?

39:36.707 --> 39:38.833
Here you go.

39:47.551 --> 39:49.969
What the hell kind of drugs
are you people giving me?

39:50.137 --> 39:52.639
Just something to keep you calm.

39:54.266 --> 39:56.893
Did you just say something?

39:58.521 --> 40:01.106
I said, the drugs are to keep you calm.

40:01.732 --> 40:04.025
Did you sleep well?

40:07.363 --> 40:10.907
- I wasn't asleep, was I?
- You were asleep for nearly a whole day.

40:11.075 --> 40:15.161
It's December 26th, Jack.
How are you feeling?

40:15.329 --> 40:17.622
- December 26th?
- That's right.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.958
- 1992?
- Yes.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.961
And that's the sun, and you're on Earth.

40:23.129 --> 40:26.381
And I know you know better, Jack.

40:26.966 --> 40:30.844
Who the hell are you?
My mom is dead. 2007.

40:31.053 --> 40:33.471
Jack Starks is dead.

40:33.889 --> 40:36.015
Get out of here, get out!

40:36.183 --> 40:38.560
- You left me in there.
- In where?

40:38.727 --> 40:43.106
You left me in that thing. In the drawer.
And then...

40:43.274 --> 40:45.108
...you put me in a straitjacket.

40:45.651 --> 40:48.903
We were forced to use restraints,
if that's what you're referring to.

40:49.071 --> 40:53.616
- It wasn't a fucking restraint.
- That's exactly what our equipment is.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.202
Relax.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.041
Don't act like I don't know what's real.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.504
You're suffering from delusions
as part of your condition.

41:06.672 --> 41:08.214
No, I know what's real, I know.

41:08.382 --> 41:12.093
You strapped me into something
and stuffed me in a fucking drawer.

41:13.846 --> 41:15.805
It wasn't a dream.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.766
I don't know what you're trying to pull,
but I wasn't...

41:18.934 --> 41:21.144
I have to say...

41:21.312 --> 41:25.607
...this is the most resilient I've seen
a patient undergoing this treatment.

41:25.774 --> 41:29.402
I had a patient a few years ago.
His name was Ted Casey.

41:31.655 --> 41:34.073
Ted sodomized a 7-year-old girl.

41:34.700 --> 41:39.162
His lawyers asked me to have a look at him
because after his deeds were done...

41:39.330 --> 41:42.790
...he climbed into the trees
of the forest where he killed her...

41:42.958 --> 41:44.375
...and howled like a dog.

41:44.543 --> 41:50.256
Ted never went to prison because everyone,
including me, believed he was sick.

41:50.424 --> 41:55.428
So he came here. Then one day a little girl
came with her mother to visit her relative...

41:55.638 --> 41:58.556
...and I caught Ted stealing looks at her.

41:59.099 --> 42:03.061
The kind you really have to steal,
if you know what I mean.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.980
I asked Ted then...

42:06.148 --> 42:12.320
...if he could remember what the little girl
who he'd slain was wearing.

42:12.488 --> 42:16.324
"Oh, yes," he said. " I remember it.

42:16.992 --> 42:19.827
I remember it well."

42:20.663 --> 42:23.122
Those were actually his last words.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.461
What happened to your face?

42:29.630 --> 42:34.259
I was careless. It won't happen again.

42:34.426 --> 42:37.345
I'll say a prayer for you, Jack.

42:37.680 --> 42:41.140
Maybe God will pick up
where the medicine leaves off.

42:41.350 --> 42:44.435
You sure you know where to find him?

44:03.057 --> 44:04.682
Jack.

44:04.850 --> 44:06.684
What are you doing, Jack?

44:06.852 --> 44:08.144
What are you gonna do to me?

44:08.312 --> 44:11.773
I thought I'd just ask you
to come inside with me.

44:11.940 --> 44:16.986
- What if I didn't want to come?
- Well, I'd probably ask you why.

44:17.154 --> 44:19.113
Because I'm not crazy.

44:19.281 --> 44:23.242
You suffer from a delusional disorder.
It doesn't mean you're crazy.

44:23.452 --> 44:25.495
It just means you're confused.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.081
You're here instead of jail because
your condition...

44:28.248 --> 44:32.752
...played a role in your crime.
- I didn't kill that cop, but I don't remember.

44:32.961 --> 44:36.714
Your mind's ability to distinguish
between your fantasies...

44:36.882 --> 44:38.758
...and the real events that happened...

44:38.926 --> 44:44.514
The real events that have happened to me
have been fucked up, not my mind.

44:47.976 --> 44:49.185
Jack.

44:51.355 --> 44:53.272
I'd like to ask you a question, if I may.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.609
Since when do people around here
start asking for things?

44:57.611 --> 45:01.114
- Okay. Smoke?
- That's what you wanna ask?

45:03.325 --> 45:05.201
No.

45:08.288 --> 45:09.789
I wanted...

45:10.332 --> 45:14.419
I wanted to ask you how your treatments
with Dr. Becker are progressing.

45:15.754 --> 45:17.797
Fine. Fine.

45:18.215 --> 45:20.967
I hope you'd tell me
if that wasn't the case.

45:21.510 --> 45:26.264
Why? Why, what would you do?
What would you do?

45:28.183 --> 45:30.518
I would try to make it stop.

45:31.645 --> 45:35.523
- I'm not sure I want him to stop.
- So it's helping?

45:38.110 --> 45:41.612
They're making me feel like
a different person.

46:03.552 --> 46:05.344
You coming?

46:06.221 --> 46:09.849
We're gonna freeze out here, you and I.

46:15.814 --> 46:19.108
Could get hurt if they catch you
trying to leave again.

46:29.119 --> 46:33.039
What do you know about the shit
they do to us in the basement?

46:34.249 --> 46:35.750
What shit?

46:35.918 --> 46:38.252
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No, I don't.

46:39.254 --> 46:42.381
Yeah, you do. That jacket.

46:49.223 --> 46:50.890
- What jacket?
- The fucking drawer.

46:51.058 --> 46:53.976
Now, stop playing games,
you know what I'm talking about.

46:56.605 --> 47:02.276
I know that they take you down there.
I know that they put you in it.

47:02.486 --> 47:04.362
The rest of it, it's...

47:05.489 --> 47:09.367
It's a trip, you know,
it's like a serious vacation.

47:10.244 --> 47:11.452
I found out I'm gonna die.

47:11.620 --> 47:14.956
Well, mortality is actually
a great thing to be familiar with.

47:15.123 --> 47:16.499
I'm gonna die in four days.

47:17.793 --> 47:21.379
That's what I found out.
They find my body in four days.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.424
What are you two yapping about?

47:26.343 --> 47:31.639
We're talking about our ability
to go forward in time...

47:31.807 --> 47:33.432
...to go into the future.

47:36.979 --> 47:39.438
I mean, that's what
we're talking about, right?

47:44.403 --> 47:46.445
Yeah, that's right.

47:53.412 --> 47:56.914
If you need to find something out
when you're in there, just calm down.

47:57.082 --> 48:00.626
The less you freak,
the less you'll trip out.

48:00.794 --> 48:05.298
Yeah, but all this shit from before
just comes tumbling...

48:05.465 --> 48:08.217
Yeah, but that shit is in the past.

48:08.385 --> 48:11.429
Focus on what you need to get now.

48:12.514 --> 48:15.224
- I gotta get back in there.
- That could be a problem.

48:15.392 --> 48:18.185
- Why?
- Lorenson's got her claws into it now.

48:18.353 --> 48:24.734
When she started getting suspicious of me
was when they stopped putting me in there.

48:24.902 --> 48:27.028
Women.

48:27.946 --> 48:29.947
What do you think I should do?

48:30.908 --> 48:33.451
You could still give Becker an itch.

48:33.952 --> 48:36.245
You might get killed
when he goes to scratch it...

48:36.413 --> 48:39.498
...but seems to me, you're saying
that's about to happen anyway...

48:40.459 --> 48:42.752
Oh, man.

48:45.088 --> 48:47.173
Please continue, Mr. Mackenzie.

48:49.134 --> 48:50.885
Okay.

48:55.766 --> 49:00.102
Well, I've been approached
by the Federal Trade Organization.

49:02.564 --> 49:05.441
And what have they approached you about,
Mr. Mackenzie?

49:06.485 --> 49:08.986
And this is nuts, but...

49:09.154 --> 49:13.282
...they have asked me to head up...

49:14.034 --> 49:17.411
...the Organization for the Organized.

49:18.789 --> 49:22.917
- The Organization for the Organized?
- Yeah, you've heard of them?

49:23.085 --> 49:25.461
No, Mr. Mackenzie, I have not.

49:25.629 --> 49:29.006
That's because there is
no such organization, you idiot.

49:29.383 --> 49:31.968
That is categorically not true.

49:32.177 --> 49:35.429
That is blatantly and manifestly not true.

49:35.597 --> 49:37.556
They have asked me to lead them.

49:37.724 --> 49:41.227
And if you'd heard of them, then they
wouldn't be hush-hush, would they?

49:42.604 --> 49:44.230
What do the rest of you think?

49:52.572 --> 49:54.573
Well...

49:55.575 --> 49:58.953
...I know they exist.
- And how is that?

50:00.038 --> 50:04.208
When I was in the Gulf,
the Organization...

50:04.376 --> 50:06.419
...was recruiting the Organized.

50:06.628 --> 50:09.505
- Is that a fact, Mr. Starks?
- It is a fact.

50:09.673 --> 50:12.967
Because if it's not,
it doesn't help Mr. Mackenzie.

50:13.135 --> 50:16.095
It is a fact. Bona fide and classified.

50:17.305 --> 50:19.515
I knew it. I knew it.

50:19.683 --> 50:22.977
You know, those little fuckers
are everywhere.

50:23.603 --> 50:25.396
They only recruit the best, Mackenzie.

50:26.189 --> 50:29.108
- Calm down, Mr. Starks.
- Stay calm, see, stay calm.

50:29.276 --> 50:32.403
Always ordering us to stay calm, be calm.

50:32.571 --> 50:36.240
Be calm. Be calm.
They order you to order me to be calm.

50:36.408 --> 50:38.784
How are we supposed
to be calm? Look at this place.

50:38.952 --> 50:42.246
So, people, wake up, okay?
Orders come from the top only.

50:42.414 --> 50:45.166
Don't let them order you around.
Long live the Organization.

50:45.333 --> 50:47.793
Long live the Organization
for the Organized.

50:47.961 --> 50:50.629
- Sit down, Mr. Starks.
- No, no, no, you've gotta listen...

50:51.048 --> 50:54.008
Long live the Organization
for the Organized.

50:54.176 --> 50:56.761
Join the Organization.
The Organization needs you.

50:56.928 --> 50:58.804
- Fight the good fight.
- You listen to him.

50:58.972 --> 51:00.556
- You don't listen to me?
- Sit down.

51:00.724 --> 51:02.641
You gotta listen to him.

51:02.809 --> 51:05.186
- Long live the Organization.
- Sit down.

51:05.353 --> 51:07.063
Join the Organization.

51:12.527 --> 51:14.653
You gotta listen to him.

51:25.540 --> 51:27.416
Oh, Starks...

51:27.584 --> 51:30.544
...you are real stubborn.

51:30.712 --> 51:32.296
But there's ways of fixing that.

51:35.217 --> 51:39.053
The less you freak,
the less you'll trip out.

51:39.846 --> 51:41.430
Stay calm.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.645
Criminally insane.

51:48.522 --> 51:51.065
Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the car...

51:51.233 --> 51:54.860
...with your hands in the air, please.
- What seems to be the problem, officer?

51:55.403 --> 51:59.448
Problem is you're moving too slow. Step out
of the car with your hands in the air.

52:00.784 --> 52:02.034
Can I open the door here?

52:20.512 --> 52:23.180
Hey, soldier boy, you awake?

52:24.933 --> 52:26.600
Didn't think so.

52:34.192 --> 52:35.442
Yeah.

52:40.907 --> 52:44.326
It's okay. You're okay.

53:10.645 --> 53:12.354
Hey, Jack, grab the ball.

53:21.740 --> 53:23.407
Show Mom, honey.

54:05.033 --> 54:06.533
Will you give me one sec?

54:18.505 --> 54:21.215
You got nerve showing up like this.

54:21.883 --> 54:23.634
You mind?

54:34.229 --> 54:36.313
Okay, here goes.

54:37.107 --> 54:40.693
Jack Starks died from a wound
to the head, January 1 st, 1993.

54:41.111 --> 54:42.820
How? I mean, how do I die?

54:44.948 --> 54:46.824
It didn't say.

54:48.201 --> 54:49.743
Does that mean you believe me?

54:50.704 --> 54:52.955
I don't know what I believe.

54:54.040 --> 54:57.751
- What else you find out?
- Whole bunch of stuff.

54:57.919 --> 55:00.045
There was a doctor. Becker.

55:00.213 --> 55:03.424
He was using some kind of behavior
modification on his patients...

55:03.591 --> 55:05.050
...that was banned in the ' 70s.

55:05.218 --> 55:07.845
And there was another doctor too,
a Dr. Lorenson.

55:08.013 --> 55:12.266
And something about a kid
she was treating. Babak.

55:12.434 --> 55:14.143
- Don't know who that is.
- I don't know...

55:14.311 --> 55:17.354
...but the whole thing
was a major scandal.

55:17.522 --> 55:21.775
Becker claimed he was trying to create
a womb-like environment for his patients.

55:21.943 --> 55:23.902
Fucking womb.

55:27.949 --> 55:30.117
It wasn't a fucking womb.

55:30.869 --> 55:34.413
Look, I have to find out how I die.

55:36.708 --> 55:38.625
Well, Alpine Grove still exists.

55:39.586 --> 55:43.505
We could go see if there's anyone around
who might know what really happened.

55:47.302 --> 55:48.969
We could.

56:07.489 --> 56:09.365
Thanks for doing this.

56:11.826 --> 56:13.827
Well, I must be the crazy one, right?

56:24.506 --> 56:27.549
I'm sorry I can't tell you more
about your uncle's death.

56:27.717 --> 56:29.635
They used the hospital medical examiner...

56:29.803 --> 56:33.263
- "Blunt trauma" doesn't tell me anything.
- I'm sorry, that's all it says.

56:33.431 --> 56:37.267
I mean, weren't there doctors?
What about Dr. Becker or Dr. Lorenson...?

56:37.852 --> 56:42.147
Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital.
She was here the same time as your uncle.

56:42.315 --> 56:44.691
I'm sure she could be
of more help to you.

56:44.859 --> 56:49.488
- And what about Becker and Hopkins?
- Dr. Hopkins died.

56:49.697 --> 56:52.241
And I'm not familiar with a Dr. Becker.

56:52.409 --> 56:56.120
Well, can you see if there'd be any kind
of forwarding address for Dr. Becker?

56:56.287 --> 56:58.789
Is there some particular reason
for these questions?

57:01.084 --> 57:03.460
He's the only family I remember.

57:12.554 --> 57:14.805
What does this guy keep smiling about?

57:14.973 --> 57:16.348
Hi. Beth Lorenson.

57:17.434 --> 57:20.018
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

57:20.186 --> 57:21.979
- Hi. Beth Lorenson.
- Jackie Price.

57:22.147 --> 57:24.064
Sit down, sit down.

57:30.822 --> 57:33.282
I'm sorry. You look exactly like him.

57:35.827 --> 57:37.077
Did you know him well?

57:37.245 --> 57:39.329
Your uncle was my most
memorable patient.

57:39.497 --> 57:41.081
- Why is that?
- In the end...

57:41.249 --> 57:44.293
...he made me change my mind
about a lot of things.

57:44.461 --> 57:48.547
- He actually helped me with a case of mine.
- Really? What case?

57:49.757 --> 57:53.218
- I was working with a little boy.
- Babak Yazdi?

57:53.428 --> 57:55.721
- Yes.
- Who was he?

57:55.889 --> 57:58.015
A friend's son.
How do you know about him?

57:58.183 --> 58:01.935
We saw it when we were looking up
information about his uncle.

58:04.772 --> 58:06.398
How did he help?

58:09.944 --> 58:13.864
Well, it's complicated, but in the end
he let me know how...

58:14.032 --> 58:17.409
...I could get through to him.
- How?

58:18.870 --> 58:21.622
It's complicated.

58:23.541 --> 58:26.084
And it was a really long time ago.

58:27.420 --> 58:31.882
Let me ask you something.
Do you know how my uncle died?

58:33.968 --> 58:38.096
Yeah, I think it was from...

58:38.264 --> 58:39.765
...a head trauma.

58:39.933 --> 58:43.060
Yes, but how? How did he get it?

58:44.270 --> 58:46.271
I don't know.

58:51.152 --> 58:52.402
You don't?

58:58.034 --> 59:01.787
Think Dr. Becker might have
a better idea?

59:10.171 --> 59:12.089
Yes, Dr. Becker would know more.

59:12.257 --> 59:14.591
- I don't believe a word she just said.
- Me neither.

59:15.176 --> 59:18.345
Come on. There's one last thing.

59:18.513 --> 59:24.017
- To remind you of the staff softball game
at 4 p.m., so don't be late.

59:31.859 --> 59:33.193
Jack, what is this?

59:43.621 --> 59:45.414
This is the room.

59:49.043 --> 59:53.088
They used to hang it over there.

59:58.219 --> 01:00:01.471
I'm actually in this drawer right now.

01:00:20.825 --> 01:00:23.702
You know what?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.371
You folks ain't supposed
to be down here.

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:27.914
We were just leaving.

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.921
Do I know you from somewhere?

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:38.508
I don't know, do you?

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:43.639
I don't know, you probably
know my uncle, Jack Starks?

01:00:45.099 --> 01:00:47.851
Goddamn, that's right.

01:00:49.395 --> 01:00:51.313
- You're his spitting image.
- Yeah, I know.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:54.524
- You could be his ghost.
- Could be.

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:58.195
- You remember him?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.238
He was a great guy.

01:01:02.408 --> 01:01:05.619
You wouldn't happen to know
how he died, now, would you?

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:09.748
I just remember them finding his body.

01:01:11.959 --> 01:01:14.503
Is that all you remember, Damon?

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.759
How do you know my name?

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:24.012
- I know all about you, Damon.
- Oh, yeah?

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.430
Oh, yeah.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:29.351
- I know you're a piece of shit.
- I don't like you getting in my face...

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.687
- Was it you?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:35.649
- He was hit in the head. Sounds like you.
- I never touched him, man, I swear.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.070
What's going on?

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:44.032
- See you, pal.
- This is a restricted area.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.411
Damon. Damon, Damon, they're gone.

01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:49.037
It's time for your medication.

01:01:52.583 --> 01:01:55.460
I'll see if I can track Becker down.

01:01:57.338 --> 01:01:58.547
How long do we have?

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:02.008
I don't know.

01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:06.471
I don't think we have
that much time. Come on.

01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:10.350
Well...

01:02:11.185 --> 01:02:13.395
...then you get yourself to me tomorrow.

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:20.819
You don't...

01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:23.864
...and I'll take it personally.

01:02:27.034 --> 01:02:28.952
Oh, yeah?

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:59.232
Do you want a drink?

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.265
I'm running out of time.

01:03:33.017 --> 01:03:36.770
I don't care. You have to come back.

01:03:37.688 --> 01:03:40.774
I didn't ask for you. But now...

01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:43.360
...you just have to come back.

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:47.364
It's not like that.
I don't have control over it.

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:49.115
Well...

01:03:49.575 --> 01:03:51.576
...get control.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.865
Come back to me, Jack.

01:05:16.203 --> 01:05:18.496
I can't help you unless you let me.

01:05:20.791 --> 01:05:25.337
- That thing is my only chance in this place.
- What thing?

01:05:25.504 --> 01:05:27.505
You don't understand.

01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:30.592
Well, try and help me understand.

01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:43.271
I've...

01:05:43.814 --> 01:05:47.067
I've seen a time that's not this time.

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:51.947
And I'm only able to see it
when I'm in there.

01:05:55.743 --> 01:05:58.328
What time is that?

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.291
2007.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.422
What year do you think it is now?

01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:14.552
- I'm not delusional. I know it's 1992.
- Okay.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.430
So tell me about 2007.
What does it look like?

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:23.436
- Doesn't look that different.
- The future doesn't look different?

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:27.107
No.

01:06:27.274 --> 01:06:28.942
Not to people like me.

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.777
You think you're traveling in time?

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:32.195
- Is that it?
- Listen.

01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:35.240
- Not everyone in this place is crazy.
- Like who?

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:38.159
Like Mackenzie, maybe?

01:06:39.453 --> 01:06:41.871
Did he tell you
he tried to kill his wife?

01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:45.417
Mackenzie locked himself up
in his house for two months...

01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:48.294
...and nearly starved himself
before he was brought here.

01:06:48.462 --> 01:06:51.798
All because his wife left him
for another man.

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:56.219
I don't care. Look, I don't have time
for this. I gotta get out of here.

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:58.388
These are all facets of your delusions.

01:07:02.226 --> 01:07:03.768
Oh, yeah?

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:11.109
What about Babak? Is that a facet?

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:15.447
How do you know about him?

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:17.991
You told me.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.662
I saw you.

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:26.916
You thought I knew something about him,
so you told me.

01:07:27.668 --> 01:07:29.377
How do you know about him, Jack?

01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:33.298
Because you told me. You told me.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.015
I know somewhere inside of you...

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:44.976
...you have to believe
that what I'm saying is true.

01:07:47.229 --> 01:07:48.480
You have to.

01:07:54.528 --> 01:07:56.738
I don't know how you know
about Babak...

01:07:59.283 --> 01:08:02.035
...but these ideas are
part of your delusions.

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:10.418
No.

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:21.970
Hey.

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:24.307
I brought you some smokes.

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:31.731
Lorenson said that your wife...

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:35.234
...left you for another man,
so you lost it.

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.198
How's that for a thank-you?

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.203
Well?

01:08:46.663 --> 01:08:48.915
I didn't want to see it. You know?

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:51.542
I'm in here because...

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:55.630
...they say I have a nervous condition.

01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:58.841
Well, well, here's my question:

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:03.388
Who wouldn't be nervous if they
really, really looked at their lives?

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:06.558
I mean, whose life is that good?

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:14.899
Rise and shine, Harold.

01:09:15.067 --> 01:09:18.569
Jamile? Have you told anybody about
my sessions with Babak?

01:09:18.737 --> 01:09:21.029
- Of course not.
- Has anyone been asking about him?

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:23.741
No. I would have told you.

01:09:27.328 --> 01:09:31.624
Well, hello there.
How you doing today?

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.836
You ready to work?

01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:41.176
Okay.

01:10:03.657 --> 01:10:07.785
Jackie.

01:10:25.262 --> 01:10:26.721
Hey.

01:10:27.139 --> 01:10:30.808
- Okay, this is really freaking me out.
- Tell me about it.

01:10:33.854 --> 01:10:37.690
- Oh, God. You want this?
- I want this.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.903
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:45.031
God, I should get the heat going.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:49.327
- Oh, I found out about the little boy.
- Yeah?

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:53.373
Babak? Lorenson used a mild form
of electroshock therapy...

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.500
...which disrupted his seizures.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:58.169
She didn't even know that's what
he was having before.

01:10:58.379 --> 01:11:00.588
That's what you have to tell her about.

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:04.592
I think Becker's house is around here
somewhere. I marked it on the map.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.095
- I think this is it.
- You sure?

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:11.516
Yeah. I called the number yesterday
to make sure.

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:16.896
All right, let's go.

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:32.036
Hi there.

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:33.788
You looking for Dr. Becker?

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:06.612
There he is.

01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:33.973
How's that work, huh?
God doesn't remember?

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:35.725
Is that it?

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:41.773
- Can I help you?
- I don't know, can you?

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:47.695
- Do I know you?
- I think you do.

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:52.283
- You're his son?
- Nope.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:54.494
Not his son.

01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:00.333
What's the matter, doc?

01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:02.835
You look like you've seen a ghost.

01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:07.256
But how can you be...?

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:12.470
- He died years ago in the hospital.
- Yeah, you killed him. Didn't you?

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:17.308
No, I didn't kill him. The treatment
might've pushed him to kill himself...

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:20.228
No, I didn't kill myself.
I died from a blow to the head.

01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:24.524
How did that happen?

01:13:26.693 --> 01:13:31.406
All I can remember from the last time
we put him in there...

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:36.869
...he... You came out and
said their names to me.

01:13:37.037 --> 01:13:38.621
What names?

01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:40.748
People I tried to help.

01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:45.545
Who were they?

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:48.214
Nathan Piechowski...

01:13:49.299 --> 01:13:50.716
...Jackson MacGregor...

01:13:52.344 --> 01:13:53.678
...Ted Casey.

01:13:55.722 --> 01:13:58.057
I didn't ask for them, any of you.

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:02.895
- You were criminals sent to me.
- We were patients.

01:14:03.063 --> 01:14:05.398
We were patients.

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:06.816
You were criminals...

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:12.029
Hold on a second. So you said I came out
of that thing, and I told you those names?

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:15.700
Well, who do you think
told me about them?

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:19.954
You did.

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:25.585
I'm in that drawer right now.

01:14:27.504 --> 01:14:29.547
I don't understand.

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:32.383
You're haunting yourself, old man.

01:14:32.593 --> 01:14:35.219
- I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
- No.

01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:38.306
You pumped me full of drugs...

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.766
...and you stuffed me
in a morgue drawer.

01:14:40.934 --> 01:14:43.352
With every intention of helping you.

01:14:45.939 --> 01:14:48.191
And that justifies it?

01:14:58.952 --> 01:15:01.287
We're all dead, Jack.

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:13.257
What is it?

01:15:13.967 --> 01:15:15.718
- I have to sit down.
- Is everything okay?

01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:20.223
- I have to sit down.
- Jack, what is it? Jack?

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:23.726
He's taking me out of there.

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:31.275
- He said it was the last time.
- What?

01:15:31.443 --> 01:15:35.863
- Jackie, he said it was the last time. Go.
- Oh, my God.

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:37.907
- What was your address?
- What?

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:40.618
When you were a kid, when we met...

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:42.787
...what was your address?

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:45.665
2140 Waldemere Way.

01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:55.466
2140... 2140...

01:16:05.352 --> 01:16:08.479
- Jackie.
- Jack. Jack, stay with me.

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:11.816
It's the last time. The last time.

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:20.992
Jack.

01:16:33.338 --> 01:16:35.339
I saw you.

01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:40.386
I know what you did to your patients.

01:16:40.637 --> 01:16:42.430
Years from now, I saw you.

01:16:42.889 --> 01:16:45.057
You told me about Piechowski...

01:16:45.225 --> 01:16:48.060
...and Jackson MacGregor...

01:16:48.228 --> 01:16:51.814
...and Ted Casey. You told me.

01:16:55.902 --> 01:16:57.528
All those guys stay with you.

01:16:57.696 --> 01:17:00.698
All of us. We all stay with you.

01:17:01.742 --> 01:17:04.368
We haunt you, haunt you.

01:17:08.915 --> 01:17:11.042
All of us.

01:17:12.919 --> 01:17:15.671
We haunt you.

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:26.140
We haunt you.

01:18:08.308 --> 01:18:11.435
Could I...? Could I have some paper?

01:18:11.603 --> 01:18:14.855
Paper and a pen.
Need to write something.

01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:18.901
Listen, your patient, Babak...

01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:21.070
...is having seizures.

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:23.406
That's why he hasn't learned
to speak properly.

01:18:23.573 --> 01:18:24.824
Who told you this?

01:18:24.991 --> 01:18:29.453
Just telling you something you already
know. You just haven't figured it out yet.

01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:33.666
He's not slow, he's having seizures.

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.961
Electro...

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:40.214
Electroconvulsion therapy.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.466
You used it on him.

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:45.010
That's how you reset him.

01:18:45.178 --> 01:18:48.514
No one would ever use ECT on a child.

01:18:49.015 --> 01:18:52.852
I don't know that he is having seizures.
If he is, that could send him into status.

01:18:53.019 --> 01:18:55.479
It's a permanent state of seizure.

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:06.115
No, no.

01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:10.286
Babak is my friend's son.
I would never risk that.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:14.582
You will.

01:19:19.129 --> 01:19:21.547
Can you just grab the end of that for me?

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:27.052
I've... I've given him a sedative.

01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:32.725
Okay.

01:19:44.154 --> 01:19:46.363
I'm only gonna do it once.

01:19:57.959 --> 01:20:00.211
The settings are very, very low.

01:20:01.087 --> 01:20:03.547
- Are you gonna stay in the room?
- Yeah.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:08.093
Okay, great. If you could just
apply some pressure.

01:20:09.262 --> 01:20:10.763
Good.

01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:13.474
I'm just gonna press this button.

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.810
I'm just gonna set it a little bit lower.

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:20.648
Okay, now I'm at the lowest possible.

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:28.531
Okay.

01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:49.176
Here we go.

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:03.524
Okay. We're done, that's it.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:06.068
We're done. Okay, it's over.

01:21:06.653 --> 01:21:08.863
All right. He's all right. He's all right.

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:11.699
Okay. Okay.

01:21:13.743 --> 01:21:14.994
Babak?

01:21:19.332 --> 01:21:20.791
Babak...

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:24.253
...how are you doing?

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.046
Can you say hi, Babak?

01:21:28.174 --> 01:21:29.967
Hi, Babak.

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:41.353
You're okay, you're okay.

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:14.470
What do you need me to do?

01:22:15.013 --> 01:22:17.056
I need to take this to someone.

01:22:17.223 --> 01:22:19.975
This is a secure unit.
There's no way I can do that.

01:22:20.143 --> 01:22:23.020
You have to. Please.

01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:26.398
- How long do you need?
- Just a couple hours.

01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:28.817
I'm gonna die tonight.

01:22:29.527 --> 01:22:31.528
It's been decided.

01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:41.372
You want me to come in with you?

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:43.791
I'll be okay.

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:22.413
Hey.

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:24.790
I remember you.

01:23:25.208 --> 01:23:27.251
I remember you too.

01:23:28.878 --> 01:23:31.338
- Come in, it's cold out there.
- Yeah.

01:23:43.643 --> 01:23:46.895
God. How've you been, Jackie?

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:51.150
- Okay.
- Yeah? How's your mom?

01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:55.946
Well, okay.

01:23:56.656 --> 01:23:58.991
Do you think I could talk to her?

01:23:59.617 --> 01:24:03.245
Hey, Mom. Mom?

01:24:09.502 --> 01:24:12.004
- Hey, Jean.
- Hey.

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:17.843
Do I know you?

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:20.637
Mom, this is the guy that fixed the car.

01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:23.140
The guy you yelled at.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:24.933
Okay.

01:24:30.106 --> 01:24:31.565
There something you need?

01:24:32.692 --> 01:24:34.485
It's something you need.

01:24:40.658 --> 01:24:43.577
Jackie, go play in the snow.

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:45.913
- Why?
- Just do it.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:56.757
Okay.

01:25:01.888 --> 01:25:03.972
I don't know how to make this
not sound crazy.

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:09.895
I know it's not gonna make
a lot of sense right now...

01:25:11.314 --> 01:25:13.107
...but...

01:25:16.194 --> 01:25:20.864
Look. Everything that I want
to tell you is in this letter.

01:25:21.574 --> 01:25:23.992
And it's really...

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:27.704
It's very important
that you believe it, because...

01:25:28.915 --> 01:25:33.794
Because it just would be a shame
if you didn't, you know?

01:25:42.595 --> 01:25:43.804
Okay, I'll read it.

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:47.766
That it?

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:50.269
Yeah, that's it.

01:26:04.868 --> 01:26:06.285
Hey.

01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:10.247
Petal...

01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:11.832
...it's nice.

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:14.334
Don't stop calling her that.

01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:17.921
I think she likes it.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:33.562
Hey.

01:26:40.778 --> 01:26:42.446
Hey, wait.

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:53.165
You be good, all right, Jackie?

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:57.628
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:28:06.906 --> 01:28:08.949
Jack? Jack?

01:28:09.659 --> 01:28:11.285
You okay?

01:28:11.911 --> 01:28:13.537
Stay with me.

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:17.416
Put me in the jacket.

01:28:17.583 --> 01:28:18.917
What do you mean?

01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:24.006
You have to put me in the jacket,
it's the only way. I gotta get in there.

01:28:30.930 --> 01:28:33.390
Jack? Jack, come on.

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.892
I need you to help me get you inside.

01:28:36.728 --> 01:28:38.270
Okay.

01:28:38.771 --> 01:28:40.230
You ready?

01:28:41.607 --> 01:28:44.401
- All right, you got it?
- I got it.

01:28:58.916 --> 01:29:01.043
- That was it.
- Justin!

01:29:01.210 --> 01:29:03.045
Put me in the jacket.

01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:06.214
- What happened?
- He slipped. He slipped on the ice.

01:29:06.382 --> 01:29:08.925
- Let's get him up. Watch his head.
- The jacket.

01:29:09.302 --> 01:29:11.136
What are you talking about?

01:29:12.055 --> 01:29:14.765
He said we have to get him
into the jacket.

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.476
I know the procedure,
but we can't do this to him.

01:29:17.643 --> 01:29:19.186
Do whatever you did with Becker.

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:22.564
I was 27 years old the first time I died.

01:29:24.067 --> 01:29:26.610
I remember there was white everywhere.

01:29:27.111 --> 01:29:30.113
There was war, and I felt alive.
But, really, I was dead.

01:29:34.577 --> 01:29:36.578
Sometimes I think
we live through things...

01:29:36.746 --> 01:29:40.123
...only to be able to say that it happened.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:43.543
That it wasn't to someone else.
It was to me.

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:48.507
Sometimes we live to beat the odds.

01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:53.637
I'm not crazy...

01:29:54.097 --> 01:29:56.223
...even though they thought I was.

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:59.351
I live in the same world as everyone else.

01:29:59.519 --> 01:30:03.355
I just saw more of it.
As I'm sure you have.

01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:08.485
They'll find my body tomorrow.

01:30:09.278 --> 01:30:11.947
You can check it out
if you don't believe me.

01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:16.493
I've seen life after my death...

01:30:18.788 --> 01:30:21.748
...and I'm telling you this
because it's the only way...

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:25.419
...to help you and your daughter
have a better life of your own.

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:37.931
Jean...

01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:41.852
...you're gonna pass out one day
smoking a cigarette...

01:30:42.019 --> 01:30:43.895
...and burn to death.

01:30:45.231 --> 01:30:49.693
Your daughter grows up living
the same sad life you're living right now.

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:53.697
And she misses you so much.

01:31:10.214 --> 01:31:15.051
Sometimes life can only really begin
with the knowledge of death.

01:31:16.345 --> 01:31:20.307
That it can all end,
even when you least want it to.

01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:35.697
The important thing in life is to believe...

01:31:35.865 --> 01:31:38.033
...that while you're alive.
It's never too late.

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:41.411
I promise you, Jean.
No matter how bad things look...

01:31:41.579 --> 01:31:44.539
...they look better awake
than they do asleep.

01:31:45.374 --> 01:31:48.543
When you die, there's only one thing
you want to happen.

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:51.254
You wanna come back.

01:31:51.422 --> 01:31:54.799
Mommy, Daddy, is it time to get up?

01:31:55.051 --> 01:31:58.053
He can't find four of us here.
Come on, go in the kitchen.

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:04.226
Oh. Boy.

01:33:37.903 --> 01:33:40.238
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:33:40.906 --> 01:33:42.657
You have a nasty cut there.

01:33:42.908 --> 01:33:44.618
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:44.994 --> 01:33:47.454
I slipped, but I'm alive.

01:33:52.168 --> 01:33:55.170
I'm on my way to the hospital.
Could I give you a ride?

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:58.423
Yeah, I'd love that.

01:34:00.259 --> 01:34:03.470
Okay. Get in.

01:34:04.096 --> 01:34:06.931
All right. Thanks.

01:34:41.842 --> 01:34:44.052
I'm sorry, one sec.

01:34:46.138 --> 01:34:47.597
Hey.

01:34:49.266 --> 01:34:51.976
That's sweet. Have a good time, okay?

01:34:52.645 --> 01:34:56.022
Yeah, yeah. Listen, Mom,
now's not actually a great time to talk.

01:34:56.190 --> 01:35:00.110
I'm on my way to work.
Yeah, I'll call you later.

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:04.030
All right. Happy New Year.

01:35:07.618 --> 01:35:10.787
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right.

01:35:11.664 --> 01:35:13.665
No problem there.

01:35:16.919 --> 01:35:18.461
How you doing?

01:35:19.964 --> 01:35:21.631
Better now.

01:35:30.516 --> 01:35:32.726
How much time do we have?

01:42:49.163 --> 01:42:51.164
