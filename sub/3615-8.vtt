WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:02.917
(<i>liquid pouring</i>)

00:05.709 --> 00:07.109
Oh!

00:07.209 --> 00:08.650
Okay, even if this works,

00:08.750 --> 00:10.359
we still have
to find Belthazor.

00:10.459 --> 00:12.109
Well, I have an idea
how to do that,

00:12.209 --> 00:14.399
but first things first:
cockles.

00:14.499 --> 00:15.234
Cockles?

00:15.334 --> 00:16.399
They're over by the crickets.

00:16.499 --> 00:17.399
And what exactly are they?

00:17.499 --> 00:19.734
Small, leaping insects
that chirp.

00:19.834 --> 00:20.399
That's funny.

00:20.499 --> 00:23.026
I meant the cockle shells,
not the crickets.

00:23.126 --> 00:23.578
I'm not really sure,

00:23.588 --> 00:25.399
but as long as they help
vanquish Belthazor,

00:25.499 --> 00:26.323
that's all I really care about.

00:26.423 --> 00:28.276
It would be nice to get
back to our lives,

00:28.376 --> 00:29.399
such as they were.

00:29.499 --> 00:30.817
Pig's feet.

00:30.917 --> 00:32.109
PIPER:
Yuck!

00:32.209 --> 00:33.276
Yuck?
Yuck!

00:33.376 --> 00:35.067
So you can slice off
a chunk of demon flesh,

00:35.167 --> 00:36.859
but you can't touch
a pig's foot?

00:36.959 --> 00:37.901
I'm a vegetarian.

00:38.001 --> 00:39.399
Since when?
Since now.

00:39.499 --> 00:42.984
Now is not the time
to get squeamish, okay?

00:43.084 --> 00:44.399
This recipe
is very important.

00:44.499 --> 00:46.399
We have to follow it
to a T.

00:46.499 --> 00:48.399
Ooh!

00:48.499 --> 00:49.399
Poor piggy.

00:49.499 --> 00:50.442
Uh, everything's
in there.

00:50.542 --> 00:53.692
We just need to get
the slice of Belthazor flesh,

00:53.792 --> 00:54.650
and we're good to go.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.399
Let's test it.
Pheebs?

00:56.499 --> 00:57.399
Something tells me

00:57.499 --> 00:59.399
she's not in
the vanquishing mood.

00:59.499 --> 01:00.234
Why not?

01:00.334 --> 01:01.192
She's worried about Cole.

01:01.292 --> 01:02.817
She hasn't heard from
him in over a week.

01:02.917 --> 01:04.399
And that's a bad thing?
Prue.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.399
You know what?
I don't like him,

01:06.499 --> 01:07.399
and I don't trust him.

01:07.499 --> 01:08.162
And it has nothing to do

01:08.172 --> 01:10.399
with him being
a greasy lawyer, either.

01:10.499 --> 01:11.775
Greasy what?

01:11.875 --> 01:13.609
Uh... greasy layer.

01:13.709 --> 01:15.692
There's a greasy layer
on this potion.

01:15.792 --> 01:17.734
PRUE:
Too much mandrake.

01:17.834 --> 01:19.901
Okay, um...

01:20.001 --> 01:20.901
what do you say

01:21.001 --> 01:21.775
we do this incantation?

01:21.875 --> 01:25.984
Anything to get rid of Belthazor
before Cole gets back.

01:26.084 --> 01:28.859
And he is coming back.

01:28.959 --> 01:30.026
Okay.

01:30.126 --> 01:32.318
ALL:
"Spirits of air, forest and sea,

01:32.418 --> 01:33.901
"set us of this demon free.

01:34.001 --> 01:35.901
"Beasts of hoof
and beasts of shell,

01:36.001 --> 01:38.418
drive this evil back to hell."

01:39.625 --> 01:42.709
Oh, didn't work.

01:43.418 --> 01:46.442
Oh, you forgot
the Belthazor flesh.

01:46.542 --> 01:47.276
Oh, yes.

01:47.376 --> 01:50.399
How can we forget
the Belthazor flesh?

01:50.499 --> 01:51.692
PRUE:
Such a slacker.

01:51.792 --> 01:54.276
Give me a second, lady.

01:54.376 --> 01:55.483
All right.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.917
Ready?

02:00.209 --> 02:01.499
Piper!

02:02.875 --> 02:03.483
Are you all right?

02:03.583 --> 02:05.399
Attack of the killer pig's feet.

02:05.499 --> 02:09.750
(<i>coughs</i>):
Remind me to step back
next time.

02:11.251 --> 02:14.151
PASTOR:
"Fret not thyself
because of evil.

02:14.251 --> 02:17.109
"Neither be envious
of wrongdoers.

02:17.209 --> 02:21.026
"For they shall soon
be cut down like the grass

02:21.126 --> 02:23.817
"and wither as the green earth.

02:23.917 --> 02:24.567
"Trust in the Lord

"Delight thyself also
in the Lord,

03:17.084 --> 03:18.942
(<i>door closes</i>)

03:19.042 --> 03:21.775
You know what I am, Belthazor.

03:21.875 --> 03:23.692
You know you can't
escape from me

03:23.792 --> 03:27.084
now that you can't
shimmer anymore.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.234
You'd be pleased.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.942
The bounty on you
was determined

03:31.042 --> 03:32.734
by the Source himself.

03:32.834 --> 03:37.399
A reflection, no doubt,
of your triumphs...

03:37.499 --> 03:39.542
and your betrayal.

03:40.583 --> 03:44.400
You're wounded, powerless.

03:44.500 --> 03:48.234
Think of your legacy, Belthazor.

03:48.334 --> 03:50.817
Die as a legend...

03:50.917 --> 03:54.042
not a coward.

03:58.376 --> 03:59.750

04:14.917 --> 04:16.709
(<i>grunts</i>)

04:44.001 --> 04:46.399
Mind if I hitch a ride?

04:46.499 --> 04:48.399
You going to the wake?

04:48.499 --> 04:50.483
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

04:50.583 --> 04:51.399
Come on.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.917
(<i>sniffling</i>)

06:00.376 --> 06:01.817
Hey.
I'll be back.

06:01.917 --> 06:03.318
Um, where are you going?

06:03.418 --> 06:05.567
I am going to school,

06:05.667 --> 06:08.399
and then...
I'm going to Cole's.

06:08.499 --> 06:10.859
Okay, aren't you forgetting
a little something

06:10.959 --> 06:13.084
like vanquishing
Belthazor?

06:13.499 --> 06:15.567
Wait, I thought you
had to write a spell

06:15.667 --> 06:16.483
to summon him first.

06:16.583 --> 06:17.109
Yes, and it's done.

06:17.209 --> 06:20.234
I'm using the one
that we called Melinda
from the past with,

06:20.334 --> 06:21.442
just rewrote it
a little bit.

06:21.542 --> 06:23.109
Really?
You think it'll work?

06:23.209 --> 06:24.399
Well, yeah, I mean, it should.

06:24.499 --> 06:25.442
It's magic calling magic,

06:25.542 --> 06:27.901
although in this
case, dark magic.

06:28.001 --> 06:29.859
Phoebe, why are you

06:29.959 --> 06:31.067
going to Cole's again?

06:31.167 --> 06:32.817
I mean, what do you really
expect to find?

06:32.917 --> 06:35.399
Mm, actually, I was gonna go
to his office.

06:35.499 --> 06:37.399
And how do you know
I've already been to Cole's?

06:37.499 --> 06:39.775
Well, you got a parking ticket
there yesterday

06:39.875 --> 06:41.276
when you
borrowed my car.

06:41.376 --> 06:41.859
Oops.

06:41.959 --> 06:43.109
Sorry, I'll pay for it.

06:43.209 --> 06:45.318
Phoebe, that's not the point.

06:45.418 --> 06:46.318
Look, please don't

06:46.418 --> 06:48.026
take this out
on me, all right?

06:48.126 --> 06:48.704
I'm not the bad guy.

06:48.714 --> 06:50.984
I know, I would just like
some understanding,

06:51.084 --> 06:52.399
you know, some support here.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.162
Look, I can't support you

06:53.172 --> 06:56.192
when I think you're just
setting yourself up to get hurt.

06:56.292 --> 06:58.399
And I have to be
honest with you.

06:58.499 --> 07:00.399
We have to be honest
with each other.

07:00.499 --> 07:01.192
That's a promise we made

07:01.292 --> 07:03.859
when Belthazor tried
to split us apart, remember?

07:03.959 --> 07:05.192
Yeah. It just
doesn't help

07:05.292 --> 07:06.692
that you never
really liked Cole

07:06.792 --> 07:08.234
from the beginning.
Yeah, well, I mean,

07:08.334 --> 07:11.318
you never really liked
any of my boyfriends, either.

07:11.418 --> 07:13.984
That's very true.

07:14.084 --> 07:15.775
I'm sorry, all right.

07:15.875 --> 07:17.984
This is your call, not mine.

07:18.084 --> 07:19.067
Thank you.

07:19.167 --> 07:21.400
Okay, are we gonna do this
or what?

07:21.500 --> 07:24.276
Uh, we are, Phoebe's not.

07:24.376 --> 07:26.151
Are you sure?
Yeah.

07:26.251 --> 07:27.817
Yeah.
Go to Cole's.

07:27.917 --> 07:29.359
It's fine.
Uh, we don't need

07:29.459 --> 07:31.399
the power of three to vanquish,
just the potion.

07:31.499 --> 07:36.817
Okay, well, why don't you
take this in case?

07:36.917 --> 07:37.859
Okay, just...

07:37.959 --> 07:39.650
you guys, no more
whispering, okay?

07:39.750 --> 07:40.400
It's hard enough for me

07:40.500 --> 07:42.650
to know that Cole's
keeping secrets from me.

07:42.750 --> 07:45.750
I can't take it
from you, too.

07:52.499 --> 07:54.792
(<i>door closes</i>)

08:25.583 --> 08:27.251
(<i>rattling</i>)

08:31.499 --> 08:34.625
(<i>grunting</i>)

09:06.499 --> 09:08.583
Oh.

09:12.209 --> 09:13.901
This is gonna be messy.

09:14.001 --> 09:16.376
That's why
we use Scotch Guard.

09:17.499 --> 09:18.318
You ready?

09:18.418 --> 09:19.817
Ready as I'll ever be.

09:19.917 --> 09:21.318
All right.

09:21.418 --> 09:23.192
"Magic forces, black and white,

09:23.292 --> 09:25.399
"reaching out
through space and light,

09:25.499 --> 09:27.318
"be he far or be he near,

09:27.418 --> 09:30.583
bring us the demon
Belthazor here."

09:32.625 --> 09:33.775
PIPER:
It's working.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.151
All right, you ready?

09:35.251 --> 09:36.192
Uh-huh.
On three.

09:36.292 --> 09:38.917
One, two... three.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.442
Oh!

09:42.542 --> 09:43.483
PIPER:
There's no boom.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.650
Why is there no boom?
PRUE:
I don't know.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.775
(<i>coughs</i>)

09:47.875 --> 09:50.399
Stupid witches.

09:50.499 --> 09:51.483
He's not...

09:51.583 --> 09:53.292
(<i>screams</i>)

09:55.625 --> 09:57.567
Ooh! You know what?!

09:57.667 --> 09:59.151
That is an antique!

09:59.251 --> 10:01.067
Whoa! Not the clock!

10:01.167 --> 10:04.959
We can't afford to keep
fixing that thing.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.399
Unless Belthazor
can morph,

10:10.499 --> 10:11.901
that is definitely
not him.

10:12.001 --> 10:13.399
All right, that
doesn't make sense.

10:13.499 --> 10:14.901
How did we get
the wrong demon?

10:15.001 --> 10:15.537
(<i>Piper sighs</i>)

10:15.547 --> 10:19.109
Hey, do you think that you could
just unfreeze his head?

10:19.209 --> 10:20.399
That way we could ask.

10:20.499 --> 10:21.442
His head?

10:21.542 --> 10:22.734
Yeah, his head.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.292
Why not?

10:26.959 --> 10:27.984
(<i>chuckles</i>)

10:28.084 --> 10:28.662
That's different.

10:28.672 --> 10:30.318
That's cool.
(<i>laughs</i>)

10:30.418 --> 10:31.942
What did you do to me?

10:32.042 --> 10:32.942
Uh, hi.
You know what?

10:33.042 --> 10:34.109
You're sort of
frozen in mid-air.

10:34.209 --> 10:36.650
Therefore we'll be asking
the questions, 'kay?

10:36.750 --> 10:37.399
Who are you?

10:37.499 --> 10:38.859
Someone who's going
to butcher you

10:38.959 --> 10:41.901
if you don't unfreeze me
right now!

10:42.001 --> 10:43.583
Okay.

10:47.709 --> 10:48.442
What?

10:48.542 --> 10:50.499
It was worth it.

10:56.084 --> 10:56.494
All right,

10:56.504 --> 10:59.859
you start talking or we
start the bonus round.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.318
I am Krell, a Zotar.

11:02.418 --> 11:04.026
Hi, I am Prue,
a Scorpio.

11:04.126 --> 11:05.399
Where is Belthazor?

11:05.499 --> 11:06.734
(<i>grunts</i>)

11:06.834 --> 11:08.399
Wait.

11:08.499 --> 11:10.692
Don't.

11:10.792 --> 11:13.292
I won't attack if you don't.

11:14.459 --> 11:16.650
I'm a bounty hunter.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.859
I track fugitive demons.

11:18.959 --> 11:23.251
And it looks like
we're after the same one.

11:43.334 --> 11:44.192
Cole?

11:44.292 --> 11:46.151
Oh.

11:46.251 --> 11:46.692
I'm so sorry.

11:46.792 --> 11:48.442
I was just looking
for Cole Turner.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.734
That's all right.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.400
So am I.

Reese Davidson,
D.A. Bureau of Investigations.

11:56.499 --> 11:57.483
And you are?

11:57.583 --> 11:58.483
Phoebe.

11:58.583 --> 11:59.192
Phoebe?

11:59.292 --> 12:01.234
Is that like Cher
or Madonna,

12:01.334 --> 12:02.399
or do you have
a last name?

12:02.499 --> 12:05.399
(<i>chuckles</i>):
No, of-of course, uh,

12:05.499 --> 12:06.399
Halliwell.

12:06.499 --> 12:08.399
Phoebe Halliwell.

12:08.499 --> 12:09.442
Is Cole okay?

12:09.542 --> 12:10.399
How do you know him?

12:10.499 --> 12:12.399
You didn't answer my question.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.650
I know.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.650
Look, I have no idea
if he's all right or not.

12:16.750 --> 12:18.525
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

12:18.625 --> 12:21.625
Nobody's heard from him
since Monday.

12:23.126 --> 12:23.901
You his girl?

12:24.001 --> 12:25.525
Yeah.

12:25.625 --> 12:26.399
I'm his girl.

12:26.499 --> 12:28.192
Well, did he mention
anything to you

12:28.292 --> 12:29.399
about what he was doing

12:29.499 --> 12:30.609
or where he was going?

12:30.709 --> 12:31.109
No.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.151
A couple of weeks ago
he had a suitcase packed,

12:33.251 --> 12:35.151
but he said his plans
had changed.

12:35.251 --> 12:36.026
What plans?

12:36.126 --> 12:37.399
I don't know.

12:37.499 --> 12:41.067
Uh, something about a big case
that he was working on.

12:41.167 --> 12:43.359
Mm-mm.

12:43.459 --> 12:45.151
Couldn't have been.

12:45.251 --> 12:45.996
No, according to his file,

12:46.006 --> 12:48.692
he hasn't been working
on a case, big or small.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.399
Not for a couple
of months.

12:50.499 --> 12:53.359
All he's done
is file extensions.

12:53.459 --> 12:57.750
Makes you wonder
what he's been
doing with himself.

12:59.499 --> 13:00.609
Well...

13:00.709 --> 13:03.734
if you happen
to hear from him...

13:03.834 --> 13:06.567
or if you think of
anything that might help,

13:06.667 --> 13:08.542
call me okay?

13:10.418 --> 13:11.959
Okay?

13:13.583 --> 13:14.959
Yeah.

13:24.459 --> 13:26.901
KRELL:
<i>I should have known better</i>

13:27.001 --> 13:28.151
than to underestimate him.

13:28.251 --> 13:30.399
I thought because Belthazor
couldn't shimmer,

13:30.499 --> 13:32.359
his other powers
were useless as well.

13:32.459 --> 13:35.234
So you don't have the power
to vanquish him.

13:35.334 --> 13:36.109
Obviously not.

13:36.209 --> 13:38.318
Otherwise I wouldn't have
needed to intercept

13:38.418 --> 13:40.192
your little calling card,
now would I?

13:40.292 --> 13:40.787
Hey, you know what?

13:40.797 --> 13:42.399
How about next time
I just freeze your head

13:42.499 --> 13:44.399
and then maybe I
can kick you in...
All right. Uh...

13:44.499 --> 13:48.192
So Belthazor was sent by
the Triad to kill us.

13:48.292 --> 13:50.942
How do we know that
you weren't sent by them, too?

13:51.042 --> 13:52.917
You're joking, right?

13:54.625 --> 13:55.734
I don't believe this.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.276
You really don't know?

13:57.376 --> 14:02.067
Hah, your whitelighter must
really be sleeping on the job.

14:02.167 --> 14:03.984
Hey!
Now wait a minute, pal.

14:04.084 --> 14:05.400
Piper...

14:05.500 --> 14:06.400
What don't we know?

14:06.500 --> 14:08.234
Belthazor killed the Triad.

14:08.334 --> 14:11.984
That's why he's on the run,
that's why I'm here.

14:12.084 --> 14:13.026
Why would he do that?

14:13.126 --> 14:16.276
Probably because they were
going to kill him...

14:16.376 --> 14:18.525
for failing to kill you.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.817
Hah, ironically,

14:19.917 --> 14:23.318
his inability to shimmer
saved him from you killing him.

14:23.418 --> 14:26.192
So instead we got you.

14:26.292 --> 14:26.704
KRELL:
Believe me,

14:26.714 --> 14:31.109
just the thought of working
with you turns my stomachs.

14:31.209 --> 14:32.567
Stomachs?

14:32.667 --> 14:33.026
But...

14:33.126 --> 14:39.399
right now I'm more interested in
killing Belthazor than witches.

14:39.499 --> 14:40.234
Hmph.

14:40.334 --> 14:43.399
Like it or not,
we need each other.

14:43.499 --> 14:44.901
You can't find him
without me,

14:45.001 --> 14:47.650
I can't vanquish him
without your potion.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.067
So then you know
where he is?

14:50.167 --> 14:51.276
Prue, you can't be

14:51.376 --> 14:53.318
seriously considering this.

14:53.418 --> 14:53.996
Answer the question.

14:54.006 --> 14:56.442
I can track his scent,
his blood...

14:56.542 --> 14:59.276
when he's in his demonic form,
not his human one.

14:59.376 --> 15:00.067
Fortunately,

15:00.167 --> 15:02.901
he can't maintain
his human self for long,

15:03.001 --> 15:04.442
especially wounded.

15:04.542 --> 15:05.318
It drains him.

15:05.418 --> 15:06.609
Uh... hi.
Could you come here?

15:06.709 --> 15:08.399
Over here, please?

15:08.499 --> 15:10.399
We've tried working
with demons before.

15:10.499 --> 15:11.442
It was a bad idea then,

15:11.542 --> 15:14.399
and it's definitely
a bad idea now.

15:14.499 --> 15:15.399
We'll let you know.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.959
No, you'll let me know now!

15:20.959 --> 15:21.775
Think fast.

15:21.875 --> 15:25.984
Belthazor won't stop
trying to kill you.

15:26.084 --> 15:29.399
Only the heads
of the Charmed Ones

15:29.499 --> 15:33.917
will convince the Source
to spare him.

15:37.499 --> 15:39.750
Leo!
Leo!

15:41.875 --> 15:43.609
Cole?

15:43.709 --> 15:45.901
Cole, are you in there?

15:46.001 --> 15:48.399
(<i>door opens</i>)

15:48.499 --> 15:50.292
Uh, sorry.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.001
Cole?

16:28.376 --> 16:29.583
Hello?

17:06.583 --> 17:08.709
Cole?

17:28.917 --> 17:29.817
Cole.

17:29.917 --> 17:32.959
You really shouldn't be here.

17:40.499 --> 17:43.276
Okay, Cole, come on,
lay down.

17:43.376 --> 17:44.442
Lay down. Easy.

17:44.542 --> 17:46.442
Easy.
(<i>groans</i>)

17:46.542 --> 17:48.067
(<i>coughing</i>)

17:48.167 --> 17:49.442
Are you okay?

17:49.542 --> 17:51.525
Do I look okay?

17:51.625 --> 17:53.400
I'm sorry.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.276
Okay, let's see

17:54.376 --> 17:55.942
how bad this is...
No, no, don't.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.192
Believe me, I've
seen worse, Cole.

17:58.292 --> 18:00.499
I said don't.

18:01.499 --> 18:03.209
Please?

18:05.667 --> 18:07.775
We got to get you
to the hospital.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.399
It's not safe there.
They'll find me.

18:10.499 --> 18:12.167
Who will find you?

18:12.625 --> 18:15.209
What's going on?
Who's after you?

18:19.042 --> 18:22.942
There was somebody looking
for you today at your office.

18:23.042 --> 18:23.537
An investigator.

18:23.547 --> 18:26.483
You didn't tell him
anything, did you?

18:26.583 --> 18:27.901
No.

18:28.001 --> 18:28.984
I don't know anything.

18:29.084 --> 18:32.209
What'd he look like?
You sure he wasn't a de...

18:33.167 --> 18:34.542
..."A"?

18:35.292 --> 18:37.026
He said that he was,

18:37.126 --> 18:39.399
and he also said
that he needed to...

18:39.499 --> 18:40.399
(<i>grunts</i>)

18:40.499 --> 18:42.942
Okay, come on, back
down, back down.

18:43.042 --> 18:44.151
(<i>groans</i>)

18:44.251 --> 18:44.655
(<i>whimpers</i>)

18:44.755 --> 18:46.734
I'm going to go get
some help, okay?

18:46.834 --> 18:49.359
(<i>whispering</i>):
Leo!

18:49.459 --> 18:50.026
Phoebe, come on.

18:50.126 --> 18:51.901
Cole, I am not going
to just sit back

18:52.001 --> 18:53.917
and watch you die, okay?

18:54.834 --> 18:57.067
(<i>whispering</i>):
Leo.

18:57.167 --> 18:58.901
(<i>sighs</i>)

18:59.001 --> 19:00.399
Okay, um...

19:00.499 --> 19:02.734
I am going to go back
to the house, okay,

19:02.834 --> 19:04.192
and I'm going
to get Leo.

19:04.292 --> 19:05.775
He's a doctor.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.459
He can heal you.

19:08.209 --> 19:09.625
Okay.

19:09.917 --> 19:11.734
Are you sure it's
safe for you here?

19:11.834 --> 19:13.525
They've already looked
for me here.

19:13.625 --> 19:14.692
They won't be back.

19:14.792 --> 19:18.499
Not for a while, anyway.

19:27.167 --> 19:30.001
You'd better be here
when I get back.

19:35.583 --> 19:39.499
(<i>door opens and closes</i>)

19:51.251 --> 19:52.192
PIPER:
I don't understand.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.067
How can you not know
that the Triad is dead?

19:55.167 --> 19:56.942
Don't you think
that's kind of important,

19:57.042 --> 19:58.859
especially since,
oh, I don't know,

19:58.959 --> 20:00.399
they've been
trying to kill us

20:00.499 --> 20:01.359
for the past
two years?

20:01.459 --> 20:03.399
We've heard rumors,
talk, but that's it.

20:03.499 --> 20:04.162
Nothing substantiated.

20:04.172 --> 20:07.442
Well, I guess you
can substantiate
it now, can't you?

20:07.542 --> 20:09.901
Jeez, have you been
sleeping on the job

20:10.001 --> 20:10.942
or what?
So, Leo,

20:11.042 --> 20:13.067
don't mind her;
she's just a little cranky.

20:13.167 --> 20:13.817
Well, you know what?

20:13.917 --> 20:16.234
I get that way
when demons are
trying to kill us.

20:16.334 --> 20:19.151
Piper, I really don't think that
Krell was trying to kill us.

20:19.251 --> 20:21.399
Otherwise, he probably
would've <i>tried</i>

20:21.499 --> 20:21.870
by now.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.942
Oh, yeah? Tell that to
the dining room table.

20:24.042 --> 20:26.026
I-Is there anything
in there on Zotars?

20:26.126 --> 20:27.775
Yeah, everything that
he said about them,

20:27.875 --> 20:28.494
which makes me think

20:28.504 --> 20:30.734
that everything else
he has said might be true, too.

20:30.834 --> 20:33.399
Including the part about
how he likes to kill witches?

20:33.499 --> 20:35.859
Including the part
about all of us
working together.

20:35.959 --> 20:38.067
Are you willing
to bet our lives on it?

20:38.167 --> 20:41.042
Are you willing not to?

20:42.251 --> 20:44.276
Look, Piper, if
we do nothing,

20:44.376 --> 20:46.609
and Belthazor somehow gets
all of his powers back,

20:46.709 --> 20:48.399
then we are going
to be looking

20:48.499 --> 20:51.067
back over our
shoulders... again.

20:51.167 --> 20:54.418
Personally, I'm
tired of that.

20:55.209 --> 20:56.151
I know, I know, okay?

20:56.251 --> 20:58.442
I-I know. You think
she's right, and...

20:58.542 --> 21:02.917
If you don't vanquish him now,
you may not get another chance.

21:04.209 --> 21:05.442
(<i>sighs</i>)

21:05.542 --> 21:07.609
"Magic forces, black and white,

21:07.709 --> 21:09.984
"reaching out through
space and light.

21:10.084 --> 21:15.542
Be he far or be he near, bring
us the demon Belthazor here."

21:19.126 --> 21:20.542
PHOEBE:
Demon!

21:21.126 --> 21:23.334
Phoebe, no, no, no, no!
Phoebe...

21:25.209 --> 21:26.192
(<i>grunts</i>)

21:26.292 --> 21:27.399
(<i>sighs loudly</i>)

21:27.499 --> 21:29.399
PHOEBE:
What? What is going on?

21:29.499 --> 21:30.026
Who is that?

21:30.126 --> 21:31.567
PRUE:
He's a demonic bounty hunter

21:31.667 --> 21:33.318
who's here to help
us find Belthazor.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.318
PIPER:
Why don't you go
sniff something

21:35.418 --> 21:36.400
while we go fill her in?

21:36.500 --> 21:37.026
There's no time.

21:37.126 --> 21:39.734
I just picked up Belthazor's
scent again.

21:39.834 --> 21:41.942
All right, give us a minute.

21:42.042 --> 21:42.650
Come here.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.399
Listen, here's the deal.

21:44.499 --> 21:46.442
Belthazor killed the Triad,

21:46.542 --> 21:47.609
and now the Source
wants him dead.

21:47.709 --> 21:50.399
Krell is trying to suck up
to the Source

21:50.499 --> 21:51.399
so he wants
to kill Belthazor.

21:51.499 --> 21:52.650
PIPER:
Belthazor wants to kill us,

21:52.750 --> 21:54.318
so the Source
won't kill him.

21:54.418 --> 21:55.399
LEO:
And if you work with Krell,

21:55.499 --> 21:56.859
you can vanquish Belthazor
before he kills you.

21:56.959 --> 21:58.901
Works for me. Leo, I have to
talk to you for a minute.

21:59.001 --> 22:01.650
KRELL:
How do you witches ever
get anything done?!

22:01.750 --> 22:05.276
If we're working together,
we need to move now!

22:05.376 --> 22:06.650
All right, we're ready!

22:06.750 --> 22:07.942
Do you have the potion?

22:08.042 --> 22:09.067
Do you have the scent?

22:09.167 --> 22:11.026
I said I did, didn't I?

22:11.126 --> 22:12.817
You two come with me.

22:12.917 --> 22:13.984
The other should go

22:14.084 --> 22:15.276
to the old cemetery.

22:15.376 --> 22:16.276
Wait, split up, why?

22:16.376 --> 22:19.109
Because he might be hiding
there, that's why.

22:19.209 --> 22:20.984
Evil frequents
cemeteries.

22:21.084 --> 22:24.109
Makes it difficult for me to
track a demon's scent there.

22:24.209 --> 22:25.567
Belthazor
knows that.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.609
Okay, so why don't
Leo and I

22:27.709 --> 22:30.734
go to the cemetery
and you guys go with him?

22:30.834 --> 22:31.817
Are you sure?

22:31.917 --> 22:33.399
Positive.

22:33.499 --> 22:35.399
PRUE:
All right, let's go.

22:35.499 --> 22:36.109
We're ready.

22:36.209 --> 22:38.442
Oh, hey, I almost
forgot to ask.

22:38.542 --> 22:40.276
Did you find out
anything about Cole?

22:40.376 --> 22:44.418
No, nothing at all
about Cole.

22:45.917 --> 22:48.499
We need to go.

22:51.625 --> 22:54.359
LEO:
<i>Phoebe, we shouldn't be here.</i>

22:54.459 --> 22:55.151
Belthazor...

22:55.251 --> 22:56.399
Can wait. Cole can't.

22:56.499 --> 22:59.151
Leo, he will die
without your help.

22:59.251 --> 23:00.650
Then he should be in a hospital.

23:00.750 --> 23:01.234
He won't go!

23:01.334 --> 23:03.442
Phoebe, I cannot heal mortals,
you know that.

23:03.542 --> 23:05.400
Not unless they were
hurt by evil.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.650
It's against the rules.

23:06.750 --> 23:07.942
So break the rules!

23:08.042 --> 23:10.084
You've done it before.

23:12.499 --> 23:14.334
I'm sorry.

23:15.667 --> 23:19.234
That wasn't fair.

23:19.334 --> 23:21.817
I just...

23:21.917 --> 23:24.376
I can't let him die, Leo.

23:24.959 --> 23:25.442
(<i>sighs</i>)

23:25.542 --> 23:27.984
You shouldn't be
asking me to do this.

23:28.084 --> 23:30.483
I know.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.542
But I am.

23:36.625 --> 23:38.834
Cole!

23:40.209 --> 23:42.399
Cole, come here

23:42.499 --> 23:44.792
(<i>moaning</i>)

24:00.001 --> 24:03.418
(<i>ethereal tone</i>)

24:11.625 --> 24:13.109
Leo, what's the matter?

24:13.209 --> 24:15.167
Something's not right.

24:19.334 --> 24:22.001
Leo, are you okay?

24:22.917 --> 24:24.625
Yeah, I think so.

24:25.959 --> 24:28.334
Cole...

24:28.959 --> 24:30.984
Phoebe...

24:31.084 --> 24:32.067
It's okay.

24:32.167 --> 24:33.917
You're okay now.

24:51.251 --> 24:53.067
Here you go, baby.

24:53.167 --> 24:54.499
Ah.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.318
Mm.

24:56.418 --> 24:59.399
Thanks. Feel like
I've been hit by a truck.

24:59.499 --> 25:02.734
You're lucky to be feeling
anything right now.
Yeah.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.499
Yeah, I know.

25:08.001 --> 25:10.167
You must be
one hell of a doctor.

25:11.542 --> 25:14.499
He is. He's the best.

25:16.209 --> 25:17.359
I owe you one.

25:17.459 --> 25:18.667
Forget it.

25:20.292 --> 25:22.959
Phoebe,
can I talk to you out here?

25:23.583 --> 25:25.567
Go ahead. I'm fine.

25:25.667 --> 25:28.126
Okay. I'll be right back.

25:37.001 --> 25:39.151
What's the matter?
Phoebe, listen to me,

25:39.251 --> 25:40.399
I think we should
get out of here now.

25:40.499 --> 25:42.525
I agree. Who's ever
after him could come back.
That is not

25:42.625 --> 25:45.399
what I'm talking
about; you saw what
happened in there.

25:45.499 --> 25:47.318
Yeah, you healed him.

25:47.418 --> 25:49.399
No, Phoebe, I only
healed part of him.

25:49.499 --> 25:50.609
That has never
happened before.

25:50.709 --> 25:52.859
Well, maybe it's just
because he's weak.

25:52.959 --> 25:54.276
That is not the reason.

25:54.376 --> 25:56.959
I can heal mortals
completely.

25:57.376 --> 25:58.984
There is no
other explanation.

25:59.084 --> 26:02.151
He is not who
you think he is.

26:02.251 --> 26:04.359
No.

26:04.459 --> 26:06.067
I don't understand.

26:06.167 --> 26:06.901
He is a demon, Phoebe!

26:07.001 --> 26:08.692
For all we know,
he could be the demon

26:08.792 --> 26:10.442
that you were trying
to vanquish.

26:10.542 --> 26:12.359
That's ridiculous.

26:12.459 --> 26:13.067
Think about it, okay?

26:13.167 --> 26:15.276
They're both hurt,
they're both on the run.

26:15.376 --> 26:16.276
You saw where Cole's wound is.

26:16.376 --> 26:19.609
It is the same place where Piper
cut the flesh from Belthazor.

26:19.709 --> 26:21.609
No... I don't believe it.

26:21.709 --> 26:23.026
You have to believe it.

26:23.126 --> 26:25.667
No, I don't, Leo!

26:27.251 --> 26:29.709
I don't.

26:30.499 --> 26:32.192
Maybe you should just go.

26:32.292 --> 26:35.026
No way I'm leaving you here
alone with him.

26:35.126 --> 26:37.499
I have the potion, don't I?

26:39.499 --> 26:41.001
Just go.

27:01.792 --> 27:04.734
Everything all right?

27:04.834 --> 27:05.400
Yeah.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.875
(<i>clears throat</i>):
Everything's fine.

27:15.499 --> 27:18.734
I can smell his blood--
he's close.

27:18.834 --> 27:20.650
Where?

27:20.750 --> 27:22.567
Get your potions.

27:22.667 --> 27:25.399
You know, it's too bad
that he's such a bad guy,

27:25.499 --> 27:27.942
'cause he could
really come in handy.

27:28.042 --> 27:30.001
Don't push it.

27:39.625 --> 27:40.859
(<i>gasps</i>)

27:40.959 --> 27:43.251
Vanquish him!

27:43.499 --> 27:47.399
Hey, what's going on?
Who are you?

27:47.499 --> 27:48.399
It's a trick!

27:48.499 --> 27:51.067
He's in his human form.
Throw the potion.

27:51.167 --> 27:52.817
I don't know, Krell,
don't you think

27:52.917 --> 27:54.984
he would have picked
a better human?

27:55.084 --> 27:57.067
Oh... no offense, honey.

27:57.167 --> 27:58.399
None taken.

27:58.499 --> 27:58.901
Here...

27:59.001 --> 28:01.459
PIPER:
Hey! Easy!

28:04.625 --> 28:08.209
And you call yourself
a Zotar. Hmm!

28:10.251 --> 28:11.959
(<i>sniffing</i>)

28:12.499 --> 28:15.399
Where did you get this coat?

28:15.499 --> 28:17.499
I didn't do anything.

28:18.500 --> 28:19.650
Tell me!

28:19.750 --> 28:20.817
I just found it!

28:20.917 --> 28:22.109
PRUE:
Leave him alone.

28:22.209 --> 28:23.399
He doesn't know anything.

28:23.499 --> 28:24.567
Yeah.

28:24.667 --> 28:26.418
(<i>grunting</i>)

28:26.667 --> 28:28.167
(<i>gasps, grunts</i>)

28:28.542 --> 28:31.692
(<i>Krell grunting</i>)

28:31.792 --> 28:33.399
BUM:
Thanks, lady.

28:33.499 --> 28:36.483
Touch me again, witch,
and I'll kill you.

28:36.583 --> 28:38.067
You had no reason
to hurt that man.

28:38.167 --> 28:40.901
I'm a demon,
it's my nature
to hurt people.

28:41.001 --> 28:42.399
Yeah, it's in our nature
to protect them.

28:42.499 --> 28:46.400
He's a pathetic wretch;
his life means nothing.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.359
If you'd let me
torture him,

28:48.459 --> 28:50.399
we'd know where
he found the coat.

28:50.499 --> 28:52.399
Whatever it takes.

28:52.499 --> 28:53.067
That's right.

28:53.167 --> 28:54.192
Well, from here on out,

28:54.292 --> 28:56.399
it's gonna take doing
things our way.

28:56.499 --> 28:57.609
(<i>chuckles</i>)

28:57.709 --> 28:59.609
Then we will fail.

28:59.709 --> 29:02.359
Because your morality
cripples you.

29:02.459 --> 29:03.609
It blinds you

29:03.709 --> 29:05.525
from doing what must be done.

29:05.625 --> 29:10.399
There are better ways of getting
answers out of people, Krell.

29:10.499 --> 29:14.067
Maybe Phoebe can
get a premonition
off this thing.

29:14.167 --> 29:16.359
PIPER:
Well, at least we
know Belthazor

29:16.459 --> 29:18.709
has very expensive taste.

29:20.499 --> 29:22.292
What? What is it?

29:22.750 --> 29:23.400
How long ago

29:23.500 --> 29:25.442
did the Triad
send Belthazor?

29:25.542 --> 29:27.499
Two months ago. Why?

29:27.792 --> 29:30.650
Does this look
familiar to you?

29:30.750 --> 29:31.525
PIPER:
I don't know. Why?

29:31.625 --> 29:34.692
Because Cole has one
exactly like it.

29:34.792 --> 29:35.875
Cole?

29:36.667 --> 29:37.859
You think Cole is...

29:37.959 --> 29:39.709
Belthazor's human form.

29:41.875 --> 29:44.026
COLE:
Too bad Leo had
to leave like that.

29:44.126 --> 29:47.650
I didn't really get a chance
to thank him properly.

29:47.750 --> 29:51.234
He knows.

29:51.334 --> 29:54.399
He knows what?

29:54.499 --> 29:57.192
He knows how grateful you are.

29:57.292 --> 30:01.359
Oh. Good.

30:01.459 --> 30:03.567
(<i>from other room</i>):
Still...

30:03.667 --> 30:04.734
I don't know
how he did it.

30:04.834 --> 30:07.276
I'd sure like to know
what his secret is.

30:07.376 --> 30:09.399
(<i>quietly</i>):
I'll bet.

30:09.499 --> 30:10.792
Sorry?

30:11.376 --> 30:13.399
PHOEBE:
Uh... nothing.

30:13.499 --> 30:14.483
Never mind.

30:14.583 --> 30:18.942
Hey, don't you think
you should lay down and rest?

30:19.042 --> 30:22.109
I mean, you are still hurt.

30:22.209 --> 30:23.567
I can't.
I've still got those people

30:23.667 --> 30:24.901
that did this to me
to deal with.

30:25.001 --> 30:29.792
Yeah, and you won't tell me
who they are, huh?

30:30.209 --> 30:33.318
I... really can't.
(<i>chuckles</i>)

30:33.418 --> 30:34.400
They don't have anything to do

30:34.500 --> 30:35.525
with that case
you're working on?

30:35.625 --> 30:38.692
The reason I ask is because
when that DA investigator

30:38.792 --> 30:41.318
came by today,
he was asking me about it,

30:41.418 --> 30:43.067
and I realized that I really

30:43.167 --> 30:45.151
didn't know anything.

30:45.251 --> 30:46.583
Looking for something?

30:51.167 --> 30:53.067
A piece of paper.

30:53.167 --> 30:55.942
I wanted to write myself
a little note.

30:56.042 --> 30:59.792
It's right in front of you
by the phone.

31:00.499 --> 31:02.167
(<i>laughs</i>)

31:04.500 --> 31:06.167
Thanks.

31:11.542 --> 31:14.167
(<i>clears throat</i>)

31:21.084 --> 31:23.276
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna
vanquish him.

31:23.376 --> 31:25.234
We're gonna vanquish
Phoebe's boyfriend?

31:25.334 --> 31:26.567
That's gonna cause
some problems.

31:26.667 --> 31:27.942
If you hesitate,
he'll kill us all.

31:28.042 --> 31:30.567
Excuse me, I'm having
a private conversation
over here.

31:30.667 --> 31:31.692
You know, I
cannot believe

31:31.792 --> 31:34.234
I let him out of
that demon trap
when I caught him.

31:34.334 --> 31:36.359
What was I thinking?
Prue, we don't know

31:36.459 --> 31:37.650
anything for sure yet.

31:37.750 --> 31:40.399
Leo, what are you doing here?
I didn't
want to get

31:40.499 --> 31:43.276
in between you
guys, but I didn't
know what to do.

31:43.376 --> 31:43.775
About what?

31:43.875 --> 31:45.901
I think Cole is...
Belthazor's
human form.

31:46.001 --> 31:47.400
Yeah, that's
why we're here.

31:47.500 --> 31:48.609
How did you know?

31:48.709 --> 31:49.399
Where is Phoebe?

31:49.499 --> 31:51.567
She's upstairs with Cole,
apartment seven.

31:51.667 --> 31:52.901
Tell me you didn't heal him?

31:53.001 --> 31:54.399
Well, not completely.

31:54.499 --> 31:55.859
You idiot!

31:55.959 --> 31:56.775
Leo!

31:56.875 --> 31:59.067
Phoebe begged me;
I didn't know what to do.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.209
You stay here; we'll fix it!

32:03.459 --> 32:05.067
Is there something
wrong, Phoebe?

32:05.167 --> 32:07.151
Something you're
not telling me?

32:07.251 --> 32:09.817
Don't you think you
have that backwards?

32:09.917 --> 32:10.399
Meaning?

32:10.499 --> 32:13.901
Well, you're the one with
all the secrets, right?

32:14.001 --> 32:15.109
Am I?

32:15.209 --> 32:17.109
You sure about that?

32:17.209 --> 32:19.775
I don't really know what
I'm sure about anymore.

32:19.875 --> 32:20.692
Yeah.

32:20.792 --> 32:22.692
I know how you feel.

32:22.792 --> 32:24.775
I doubt that.

32:24.875 --> 32:28.318
I think I know what's
going on here, Phoebe,

32:28.418 --> 32:31.834
and I'm sorry
it's come to this.

32:33.126 --> 32:34.734
But I'm not sorry about us.

32:34.834 --> 32:36.834
You need to know that.

32:38.499 --> 32:41.192
You never told me
where you were from.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.276
You never asked.

32:43.376 --> 32:44.750
I'm asking now.

32:45.499 --> 32:49.399
Why don't you ask me
what you really want
to know, Phoebe?

32:49.499 --> 32:51.459
I won't lie to you.

32:53.292 --> 32:55.583
Who are you?

32:59.459 --> 33:00.292
Krell!

33:04.667 --> 33:07.834
(<i>Phoebe gasps</i>)
PRUE:
No!

33:12.834 --> 33:14.875
Phoebe!

33:20.418 --> 33:23.067
You let Belthazor escape!

33:23.167 --> 33:24.442
You almost killed
our sister.

33:24.542 --> 33:27.399
Your sister
is dead anyway.

33:27.499 --> 33:29.499
He only needed her to get away.

33:31.499 --> 33:33.400
I don't think
Cole will hurt Phoebe.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.276
No, but maybe Belthazor would.

33:35.376 --> 33:36.734
Then why hasn't he?

33:36.834 --> 33:38.318
He's had so many chances.

33:38.418 --> 33:38.912
He just used her

33:38.922 --> 33:41.942
until he could get all three
of you,

33:42.042 --> 33:44.525
the Charmed Ones.

33:44.625 --> 33:45.151
(<i>scoffs</i>)

33:45.251 --> 33:48.399
Why he couldn't follow through,
I'll never understand.

33:48.499 --> 33:49.399
Maybe he fell in love.

33:49.499 --> 33:51.734
Yeah, or maybe that
was just a trick.

33:51.834 --> 33:53.399
I mean demons
will do whatever
it takes, remember?

33:53.499 --> 33:56.483
Glad to see I've had
a positive influence on you.

33:56.583 --> 33:58.151
I can save

33:58.251 --> 34:01.399
your sister,
if it's not too late.

34:01.499 --> 34:02.734
Why would you
want to?

34:02.834 --> 34:03.692
I wouldn't.

34:03.792 --> 34:04.399
But I'll do it

34:04.499 --> 34:07.942
if it's the only way
to kill Belthazor.

34:08.042 --> 34:08.775
Give me the potion.

34:08.875 --> 34:11.399
I can find him
and get to him
faster alone.

34:11.498 --> 34:13.109
Nice try. Forget it.
You already said

34:13.208 --> 34:15.442
that you can't track him
if he can shimmer.

34:15.542 --> 34:18.483
But he can't shimmer well.

34:18.583 --> 34:19.692
He needs time to recharge.

34:19.792 --> 34:22.650
Your whitelighter only healed
his human half.

34:22.750 --> 34:24.984
I'm sorry. His human half?

34:25.083 --> 34:27.399
That's why the Triad sent him.

34:27.498 --> 34:28.900
He understands you.

34:29.001 --> 34:29.536
He can blend in.

34:29.547 --> 34:33.109
A full-blooded demon
could never have
gotten so close.

34:33.208 --> 34:36.500
Give me the potion.

34:38.498 --> 34:43.498
If you hurt her,
we'll track you down.

34:49.500 --> 34:50.734
Do you really trust him?

34:50.833 --> 34:52.442
No. Come on.

34:52.542 --> 34:53.984
Where are we going?

34:54.083 --> 34:56.251
Oh, to where
demons hide.

34:59.459 --> 35:02.359
Can we stop with the shimmering
all over the place?

35:02.459 --> 35:03.234
I'm gonna vomit!

35:03.334 --> 35:05.667
I had to lose Krell.

35:08.376 --> 35:10.583
(<i>groaning</i>)

35:13.667 --> 35:16.499
Now it's time to vanquish you.

35:20.875 --> 35:23.359
Don't even think
that's gonna save you.

35:23.459 --> 35:23.578
I don't.

35:23.588 --> 35:25.609
I just wanted you to see
who I really am, Phoebe.

35:25.709 --> 35:30.084
I've seen who
you really are... Belthazor.

35:32.251 --> 35:34.042
Wait, wait.

35:34.917 --> 35:36.318
I won't hurt you.

35:36.418 --> 35:37.499
No?

35:37.667 --> 35:40.875
It's a little too late
for that, don't you think?

35:42.084 --> 35:44.359
Why?

35:44.459 --> 35:46.359
Why didn't you just kill me?

35:46.459 --> 35:49.609
Why did you have
to put me through
all this?

35:49.709 --> 35:50.399
Was it some

35:50.499 --> 35:52.442
sick, twisted demonic thrill?

35:52.542 --> 35:54.192
Was that what it was?

35:54.292 --> 35:55.567
No, that's not it.

35:55.667 --> 35:56.567
Then what was it?!

35:56.667 --> 35:58.399
I couldn't kill you.

35:58.499 --> 35:59.483
I tried.

35:59.583 --> 36:01.192
I was supposed to.

36:01.292 --> 36:01.901
I mean, at first,

36:02.001 --> 36:05.276
you and your sisters thwarted
my attempts.

36:05.376 --> 36:06.399
Even when I went back in time

36:06.499 --> 36:09.067
to destroy your line
on All Hallow's Eve.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.859
That was you?

36:10.959 --> 36:12.942
Then Troxa, Andras.

36:13.042 --> 36:15.692
I got him to
strip your powers,

36:15.792 --> 36:17.151
to make you vulnerable.

36:17.251 --> 36:20.984
I had you, too,
right where I wanted you.

36:21.084 --> 36:25.817
All I had to do
was finish the job.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.459
But I couldn't.

36:28.499 --> 36:30.859
Because I realized
I loved you.

36:30.959 --> 36:33.901
You... bastard!

36:34.001 --> 36:36.775
That's the truth, Phoebe.

36:36.875 --> 36:38.399
I admit

36:38.499 --> 36:41.442
everything else is a lie,
but not that.

36:41.542 --> 36:44.734
I know you know
that, too,

36:44.834 --> 36:47.542
in your heart.

36:49.042 --> 36:51.567
This isn't a mask, Phoebe.

36:51.667 --> 36:55.459
It's who I am...
who I really am.

36:56.499 --> 37:00.399
I'm half human.
My father was mortal.

37:00.499 --> 37:02.151
You're lying.

37:02.251 --> 37:04.399
How else would
I bleed red?

37:04.499 --> 37:06.026
Even as my demon self.

37:06.126 --> 37:07.525
You have to
believe me, Phoebe.

37:07.625 --> 37:12.875
I forgot what it was like
to be human, to feel, to care.

37:14.499 --> 37:16.151
Then I met you.

37:16.251 --> 37:21.359
That doesn't change anything
because you're still a demon!

37:21.459 --> 37:24.583
One who's done
unspeakable things.

37:27.499 --> 37:29.942
But you've awakened
something in me, Phoebe.

37:30.042 --> 37:33.499
Something I thought
had died a long time ago.

37:35.209 --> 37:36.817
My humanity.

37:36.917 --> 37:38.734
My ability to love.

37:38.834 --> 37:41.192
I want to believe you.

37:41.292 --> 37:43.542
Then let me prove it to you.

37:46.292 --> 37:48.209
Vanquish me.

37:55.499 --> 37:56.151
Cole!

37:56.251 --> 37:57.525
Cole, you gotta get up!

37:57.625 --> 37:58.567
Cole, get up!

37:58.667 --> 37:59.734
(<i>coughing</i>)

37:59.834 --> 38:00.775
Come on!

38:00.875 --> 38:02.418
Come on!

38:11.542 --> 38:13.499
(<i>coughing</i>)

38:15.499 --> 38:16.859
Cole, no,
don't do this!

38:16.959 --> 38:18.234
Come on!

38:18.334 --> 38:19.399
Come on.

38:19.499 --> 38:21.209
All right.

38:27.959 --> 38:30.817
I should have known
you'd come back here.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.359
Don't hurt her.

38:32.459 --> 38:35.400
You disappoint, Belthazor.

38:35.500 --> 38:36.400
You've changed.

38:36.500 --> 38:41.483
You let your weaker human side
affect your better judgment.

38:41.583 --> 38:44.499
It's going
to cost you your life.

38:45.499 --> 38:46.667
(<i>yells</i>)

39:01.418 --> 39:02.499
Witch!

39:04.001 --> 39:05.334
No!

39:11.583 --> 39:13.499
(<i>coughing</i>)

39:18.209 --> 39:20.209
Do you believe me now?

39:30.167 --> 39:32.817
Phoebe!
Phoebe!

39:32.917 --> 39:34.792
Phoebe!

39:38.500 --> 39:39.692
I'd better go.

39:39.792 --> 39:42.650
They'll keep looking for you
until they find you.

39:42.750 --> 39:44.334
Your sisters?

39:45.750 --> 39:46.483
Them, too.

39:46.583 --> 39:48.499
PRUE:
Phoebe?

39:51.917 --> 39:52.692
Give me your shirt.

39:52.792 --> 39:54.525
My shirt?

39:54.625 --> 39:55.875
Hurry up!

40:03.499 --> 40:06.042
Give me your hand.

40:06.667 --> 40:08.376
Trust me.

40:14.209 --> 40:16.542
(<i>gasps, groans</i>)

40:29.625 --> 40:30.917
Oh! Ooh!

40:32.667 --> 40:34.500
Phoebe.
There!

40:35.042 --> 40:38.399
Nobody will look for you
anymore.

40:38.499 --> 40:39.750
You're dead.

40:43.126 --> 40:45.525
Phoebe?!

40:45.625 --> 40:46.399
Down here!

40:46.499 --> 40:49.499
You have to go,
please!

41:04.499 --> 41:06.084
PRUE:
Pheebs?

41:08.334 --> 41:11.667
Phoebe, thank God
you're okay.

41:12.792 --> 41:14.500
He killed Krell.

41:15.583 --> 41:17.834
And you did what
you had to do.

41:22.334 --> 41:24.459
I know.

41:53.167 --> 41:55.399
We brought you
some comfort food.

41:55.499 --> 41:56.067
Thanks.

41:56.167 --> 41:57.775
I'm not really that hungry.

41:57.875 --> 42:01.817
You want to talk?

42:01.917 --> 42:02.400
Um-um.

42:02.500 --> 42:06.359
I don't know what there is
to talk about.

42:06.459 --> 42:09.109
You were right... as usual.

42:09.209 --> 42:11.234
I didn't want to be right.

42:11.334 --> 42:12.400
I know.

42:12.500 --> 42:17.042
Believe me, Prue, you have
nothing to apologize for.

42:18.500 --> 42:19.775
But I do.

42:19.875 --> 42:23.067
I don't....

42:23.167 --> 42:24.399
What I did was...

42:24.499 --> 42:27.026
Phoebe, he fooled us all,
not just you.

42:27.126 --> 42:29.399
That's not what I mean.

42:29.499 --> 42:31.026
I don't know,
I just...

42:31.126 --> 42:32.625
I feel so...

42:34.499 --> 42:35.609
...ashamed.

42:35.709 --> 42:38.499
You can't be so hard
on yourself.

42:39.834 --> 42:42.942
You didn't do anything wrong,
you know.

42:43.042 --> 42:45.583
Didn't I?

42:48.542 --> 42:52.959
Well, the important thing
is that it's over.

42:53.500 --> 42:54.650
And we can get on
with our lives now.

42:54.750 --> 42:59.499
At least until the next
Belthazor attacks.

43:00.418 --> 43:02.834
We'll leave you alone.

43:03.084 --> 43:06.276
Let us know
if you need
anything.

43:06.376 --> 43:08.084
Thanks.
