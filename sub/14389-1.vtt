02:44.316 --> 02:45.669
Stop that!

02:45.777 --> 02:48.496
Stop what?
I'm not doing anything.

02:49.947 --> 02:52.541
Ow!
Serves you right.

02:52.698 --> 02:57.056
Will you cut that out?
I can't help myself.

02:57.287 --> 02:59.597
You're as sneaky
as your father was.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.898
He was the tomato thief of all time.

03:02.042 --> 03:04.510
- I know what you're doing.
- I'm hungry.

03:04.670 --> 03:07.662
Let me finish dinner
before you eat it. Chop these.

03:09.049 --> 03:10.721
Sorry, fellas.

03:10.843 --> 03:15.599
Oh, Mom, tomorrow night we're going
with Tiffany to buy a Christmas tree.

03:15.848 --> 03:18.601
OK, but a small one.
Watch your fingers.

03:18.767 --> 03:20.884
No way, a big one. Ow! Shit!

03:21.019 --> 03:24.854
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, it adds flavour.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.921
- Hello?
- We don't want any.

03:33.073 --> 03:34.301
Thea who?

03:34.408 --> 03:37.764
I know it's Thea Brody.
How many grandkids do I have?

03:37.952 --> 03:41.501
- 'I can call by myself.'
- I know. You're a big girl.

03:41.707 --> 03:45.620
- 'I'm five now, Grandma.'
- I know you're five.

03:45.836 --> 03:48.304
Hi, kiddo.
How're you doin' down there?

03:48.463 --> 03:51.581
'I'm fine, Uncle Sean.
I'm taking swimming lessons.'

03:51.758 --> 03:54.319
- 'She swims like a fish.'
- Michael!

03:54.469 --> 03:56.426
- Hey, bro.
- The fish. Check it.

03:56.555 --> 03:58.864
- No way! You check it.
- I'm on the phone.

03:59.017 --> 04:03.056
- 'What's going on? '
- Your grandmother is a slave driver!

04:03.271 --> 04:05.990
- Did you get the book?
- 'Yeah. Thanks! '

04:06.148 --> 04:10.699
Ask the big doctor about his job.
Tough life, you Bahamian beach bum.

04:10.944 --> 04:12.139
'I heard that.'

04:12.237 --> 04:13.910
- He heard that.
- Good.

04:14.031 --> 04:16.863
Hey, how come you get to leave early?

04:17.034 --> 04:19.868
Cos my desk is closer to the door.

04:20.038 --> 04:23.154
- A big one.
- No, your brother won't be here.

04:23.332 --> 04:25.892
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, Jim.

04:26.043 --> 04:29.160
- Eggnog time Thursday night!
- We'll be there.

04:29.338 --> 04:32.489
We are getting a big tree
for all the old ornaments...

04:32.673 --> 04:37.111
- With stockings on the mantle...
- And cookies and beer for Santa.

04:37.346 --> 04:41.578
All right! Tiffany, do you realise
what a madman you're marrying?

04:41.808 --> 04:43.685
Yes, I do.

04:43.810 --> 04:45.290
- I gotta check in.
- OK.

04:45.395 --> 04:47.671
- See you. Love you.
- Bye. Me, too.

04:47.814 --> 04:50.090
- Don't be late!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.241
That bad, huh?

04:57.366 --> 05:01.518
We're out of decaf,
petty cash and requisition forms.

05:01.746 --> 05:03.304
Anything to do before I go?

05:03.413 --> 05:06.326
That man keeps calling
about his training film.

05:06.500 --> 05:09.173
He won't believe
we don't have a SWAT team.

05:11.089 --> 05:12.123
Good night, Polly!

05:12.214 --> 05:14.170
Amity Police Department.

05:15.467 --> 05:16.661
Hold it!

05:18.052 --> 05:20.567
There's an old dock piling
in the channel.

05:20.722 --> 05:24.398
Maybe it'll just keep on
drifting till it goes away?

05:24.601 --> 05:28.310
- It's stuck on a channel marker.
- Good night, Polly.

05:30.064 --> 05:32.737
Uh-huh. It... Hold it!

05:35.904 --> 05:39.658
It has to be cleared
before the fishermen come back.

05:39.866 --> 05:41.141
Where's Lenny?

05:41.285 --> 05:44.402
Out to Ben Master's place.
Cow tipping.

05:44.622 --> 05:45.816
Cow tipping?

05:45.914 --> 05:51.228
Says kids tip over his sleeping cows.
They're not givin' milk.

05:51.545 --> 05:54.264
OK, I'll take care of it.

05:54.423 --> 05:57.335
Deputy Brody will
take care of it personally.

05:57.509 --> 06:00.023
Call home, tell 'em I'll be late.

06:00.178 --> 06:03.649
- Uh-huh.
- Cow tipping!

06:03.849 --> 06:07.364
# The first Noel

06:07.560 --> 06:11.189
# The angels did say

06:11.398 --> 06:14.947
# Was to certain poor shepherds

06:15.151 --> 06:17.665
# In fields as they lay... #

06:17.821 --> 06:21.132
- No, no, no, no! Hold it!

06:21.325 --> 06:26.319
Hold it! Together, people!
Together, remember?

06:26.580 --> 06:30.937
All right. Let's try it again.
Two, three.

06:34.504 --> 06:36.496
Where the hell are the Wise Men?

06:36.631 --> 06:38.542
Good luck, Harry.

06:38.675 --> 06:41.395
I'm gonna need it with this bunch.

06:41.553 --> 06:44.352
Sounds better than
when I was a shepherd.

06:44.513 --> 06:47.233
Joseph,
where the hell is your robe?

06:47.392 --> 06:50.190
You're supposed to be
in costume! Jesus!

06:50.354 --> 06:52.629
I'm over here!

07:25.638 --> 07:31.634
All right, clear quickly.
Ready, angels, and...

08:19.110 --> 08:23.946
Very good, people. Very good.
And now, again, "Noel," everyone.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.959
Oh, God!

09:02.527 --> 09:07.124
Oh, God! Help!

09:15.582 --> 09:17.413
Help me!

09:17.544 --> 09:21.014
Oh, God! Help me!

10:37.831 --> 10:42.222
His things.
I thought you'd want them.

11:01.063 --> 11:04.100
Grandma! Grandma!

11:10.656 --> 11:12.373
We're here!

11:13.283 --> 11:14.273
Grandma?

11:16.995 --> 11:18.872
- Mom?
- We're here.

11:18.997 --> 11:22.308
Thea, get down here. Come on.

11:22.501 --> 11:24.378
Anybody home?

11:27.798 --> 11:30.359
Michael.

11:30.509 --> 11:32.341
Where's Mom?

11:32.468 --> 11:35.302
She's been out there for hours.

11:35.472 --> 11:38.032
How's she doing?

11:43.605 --> 11:46.040
We've just come from Tiffany's house.

11:46.191 --> 11:49.024
Poor girl.
The doctors had to sedate her.

11:51.698 --> 11:54.895
- Hello, Mrs Taft.
- Hi, sweetheart.

11:55.076 --> 11:59.354
I didn't recognise you, Thea.
You're so grown up.

11:59.581 --> 12:02.140
Uncle Sean is dead, you know.

12:02.291 --> 12:06.079
- Will he ever come back?
- We'll talk about that more later.

12:06.295 --> 12:07.967
Are you hungry?

12:08.088 --> 12:10.444
I had a hamburger
on the plane.

12:10.592 --> 12:15.108
We can do better than that.
How about a funny bone sandwich?

12:17.640 --> 12:22.192
How was the aeroplane ride?
Good. I got two lollipops.

12:47.085 --> 12:50.875
- It came for him.
- What?

12:51.089 --> 12:54.479
It waited all this time,
and it came for him.

13:03.142 --> 13:07.898
You guys must be starving.
I'll make some fettuccini.

13:08.148 --> 13:11.459
I'm making dinner.
You should sit and relax.

13:11.652 --> 13:14.610
Really, Ellen,
there's nothing left to do.

13:21.370 --> 13:23.565
I want you to get out of the water.

13:23.705 --> 13:24.934
What?

13:25.041 --> 13:27.680
I want you to give up
that terrible job!

13:27.834 --> 13:30.190
- You can't be serious.
- Damn right.

13:30.337 --> 13:32.487
I'm just getting started.

13:32.631 --> 13:36.988
- I don't want you near the water.
- Mom, you're upset.

13:37.219 --> 13:40.370
I don't want my family
anywhere near the water again.

13:40.557 --> 13:43.788
- Never!
- You can't believe that voodoo.

13:43.976 --> 13:46.251
Sharks don't pick people to murder.

13:46.395 --> 13:49.034
It picked out Sean.
It killed your father.

13:49.188 --> 13:52.306
- Dad died from a heart attack.
- He died from fear.

13:52.484 --> 13:54.794
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, listen to me.

13:54.987 --> 13:58.582
There's never been a great white
where we live, ever.

13:58.782 --> 14:01.501
It's warm water. They don't like it.

14:01.659 --> 14:04.458
Your brother's dead.
Your father's dead.

14:13.423 --> 14:17.018
It was a piece of wood!
It was a shitty piece of wood!

14:17.259 --> 14:19.090
Michael!

14:22.724 --> 14:25.363
He was just doing his job.

14:29.396 --> 14:32.035
God, he could make me laugh
sometimes.

14:32.190 --> 14:35.183
He was always taggin' after me
when we were kids.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.716
He always wanted to do
what I was...

14:41.450 --> 14:42.964
Hey, where are you going?

14:43.076 --> 14:45.432
Nowhere!

14:58.134 --> 15:01.285
"To everything
there is a season,

15:01.511 --> 15:05.551
"and a time to every purpose
under heaven.

15:05.807 --> 15:09.483
"A time to be born
and a time to die.

15:09.728 --> 15:13.483
"A time to plant,

15:13.689 --> 15:17.365
"and a time to pluck up
that which is planted.

15:17.570 --> 15:19.561
"A time to kill and a time to heal.

15:19.696 --> 15:25.806
'"A time to break down
and a time to build up.

15:26.119 --> 15:29.396
'"A time to weep
and a time to laugh.'

15:29.582 --> 15:34.736
"A time to mourn and a time to dance.

15:35.003 --> 15:37.564
"A time to cast away stones

15:37.714 --> 15:40.513
"and a time
to gather stones together.

15:40.676 --> 15:42.905
"A time to embrace

15:43.052 --> 15:47.524
"and a time
to refrain from embracing."

15:48.809 --> 15:51.370
Hey, Tom, wait up!

15:54.313 --> 15:56.305
Oh, you're gonna spoil her.

15:56.483 --> 15:58.474
That's what grandmas are for.

16:00.612 --> 16:03.411
Why don't you come down
to the islands with us?

16:03.574 --> 16:05.849
- I... I can't do that.
- Come on, Mom.

16:05.993 --> 16:08.826
- Get warm, spend time with Thea...
- Yes!

16:08.996 --> 16:11.908
Come here, you.

16:16.169 --> 16:19.765
Wanna know what I think?
I think it's a wonderful idea.

16:19.965 --> 16:22.638
- Yes.
- Come on, at least consider it.

16:22.801 --> 16:25.794
- Get away. You shouldn't be alone.
- Yes!

16:25.971 --> 16:27.529
- Great!
- Yay!

16:27.639 --> 16:30.631
- We can catch the 4.30 ferry.
- Today?

16:30.809 --> 16:32.128
- Today.
- No, I can't.

16:32.228 --> 16:33.422
Yes, you can.

16:39.526 --> 16:42.598
- Swing me, swing me!
- OK, OK.

16:42.779 --> 16:45.293
Oh, my back! I can't do this.

16:45.450 --> 16:48.487
I'll take her.
Oh, my God, she's too heavy.

16:48.660 --> 16:50.651
Help us, Daddy.

16:50.829 --> 16:53.741
OK, here we go. Aeroplane ride.

16:56.543 --> 16:59.182
I know.
I'm gonna throw you overboard.

17:51.848 --> 17:53.406
Oh, look!

17:53.518 --> 17:56.954
Oh, hey,
I always wanted to ride one of those.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.612
No way.
Chicken.

17:59.773 --> 18:04.005
Mom always said if God meant us
to ride parachutes for fun,

18:04.237 --> 18:06.955
- we'd be born with tickets.
- I never said that.

18:07.155 --> 18:10.034
Yes, you did. August 1977.

18:10.201 --> 18:13.239
Where's the lady who brings the soda?

18:13.412 --> 18:15.402
They had them on the big plane.

18:15.540 --> 18:17.929
There's some coffee in the Thermos.

18:18.083 --> 18:20.551
I'm too young for coffee.
Can I drive?

18:20.711 --> 18:22.589
Thea!

18:22.714 --> 18:26.593
Sometimes Dad puts me in his lap
and lets me steer the Jeep.

18:26.801 --> 18:31.511
Sometimes I let interesting people
sit in my lap and steer the plane.

18:31.763 --> 18:33.401
- Oh, really?
- Really.

18:33.514 --> 18:34.913
- Hoagie?
- Yeah?

18:35.018 --> 18:37.930
Jake says you'll have to fly the rest
of your life

18:38.104 --> 18:40.139
to pay off what you lost at craps.

18:40.272 --> 18:44.585
Good news travels fast.
I'll get it back next time.

18:44.817 --> 18:48.015
How come it bumps up and down
when there's no road?

18:48.196 --> 18:49.471
The wind does that.

18:52.283 --> 18:54.354
You been to the Bahamas before?

18:54.493 --> 18:57.088
- No.
- First time's the best.

18:57.246 --> 19:00.239
Then you know too much
and nothing's the same.

19:00.459 --> 19:02.768
What makes the plane go up and down?

19:02.920 --> 19:06.548
Easy. You go like this,
and the houses get bigger.

19:10.010 --> 19:12.809
Then you go like this,
and the houses get smaller.

19:15.140 --> 19:18.052
- Do you wanna go for a ride?
- Yes!

19:24.440 --> 19:30.471
# And so I'm offering
this simple phrase

19:30.780 --> 19:35.172
# To kids from one to 92

19:35.411 --> 19:38.848
# Although it's been said

19:39.040 --> 19:41.714
# Many times, many ways

19:41.875 --> 19:44.708
# Merry Christmas

19:44.878 --> 19:49.714
# To you #

19:49.966 --> 19:54.357
Kenny and Tamika are playing
on the dock. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

19:59.433 --> 20:01.265
Everybody out!

20:02.855 --> 20:05.972
- Come on.
- Kenny, Tamika! I'm back! I'm home!

20:06.149 --> 20:08.823
Let me help you
with the bags there, Romeo.

20:08.985 --> 20:11.863
- You can take the heavy ones.
- Thanks, buddy.

20:12.030 --> 20:15.626
Grandma! Grandma!

20:15.827 --> 20:17.977
Your room's in here.

20:18.120 --> 20:21.078
Grandma, watch me! Grandma!

20:21.248 --> 20:23.638
Thea! Get down from there!

20:23.792 --> 20:26.785
- Grandma, watch me!
- Get down from there!

20:26.962 --> 20:30.557
- Mommy lets me.
- It's too dangerous! Don't do that!

20:30.758 --> 20:33.875
- Grandma, watch me!
- Come on, sweetheart.

20:34.052 --> 20:36.089
But you always let me.

20:36.221 --> 20:38.177
Not today. Come on, Thea.

20:38.307 --> 20:41.185
The other kids are.

20:41.351 --> 20:43.501
Daddy, why can't I?

20:43.645 --> 20:48.197
Did you hear what I said?
Come inside the house right now!

20:48.442 --> 20:52.640
- I don't want to. I wanna swing.
- Right now you have to unpack.

20:52.863 --> 20:57.220
I didn't mean to start all this.
I feel like such a grandma.

20:57.451 --> 21:00.648
Come on. I'll show you around.

21:00.829 --> 21:03.627
No! No! Put me down!

21:03.790 --> 21:06.862
- Will you stop making a scene?
- I wanna swing!

21:09.630 --> 21:12.019
I'll be all right, Michael.

21:12.173 --> 21:14.209
Good. So will I.

21:22.142 --> 21:25.293
She calls it
"Tourist on the Loose".

21:25.480 --> 21:29.268
The local government commissioned it
for the public beach.

21:29.482 --> 21:33.157
- You forgot about the store.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

21:33.363 --> 21:35.398
We need milk, bread...

21:35.572 --> 21:37.847
There's a big unveiling ceremony.

21:37.991 --> 21:41.143
- We need beer!
- OK, I'll be right there!

21:42.370 --> 21:44.440
Pretty good, huh?

21:46.165 --> 21:47.997
Yeah.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.632
Grandma?

23:00.741 --> 23:03.778
'Will you stop fartin' around?

23:03.952 --> 23:07.070
'Michael, what the hell
you doin' down there, eh? '

23:07.246 --> 23:10.080
Jake, stop bustin' my chops.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.810
'Listen, you remember
what they look like?

23:12.962 --> 23:15.636
'Hard on the outside,
chewy on the inside.

23:15.839 --> 23:18.354
'Sometimes they come
with a little grime.

23:18.509 --> 23:19.989
'Move your ass, man! '

23:20.092 --> 23:22.209
Ah, bingo!

23:22.804 --> 23:25.682
Good. How many you got?

23:25.849 --> 23:29.762
Come on, Michael, talk to me.
Give me some numbers. How many?

23:30.020 --> 23:32.454
- 'Leave me alone.'
- You're full of shit.

23:32.606 --> 23:36.963
'You been down there all day,
nothin' to show but excuses.

23:37.194 --> 23:40.152
'Michael,
you're taggin' the damn things.'

23:40.363 --> 23:43.561
I gotta separate the ladies
from the gentlemen first.

23:43.742 --> 23:49.100
No, man, don't. You move too slow.
You got two speeds - slow and slower.

23:49.373 --> 23:52.046
Hold your water, Jake.
The females have eggs.

23:52.209 --> 23:55.440
So we're gonna stop everything
and pass out cigars?

23:55.629 --> 23:59.589
We're being paid to see
where they go, how they propagate.

23:59.799 --> 24:04.554
If we had decent funding, I'd study
their motor systems, temperature...

24:04.805 --> 24:09.196
We'd do a decent report for a change
and really give them something.

24:09.433 --> 24:12.790
If you'd leave me alone,
I'd be able to do my work.

24:12.979 --> 24:15.334
I know how to tag a damn conch.

24:15.481 --> 24:18.360
- Your readings suck, man.
- The tags suck.

24:18.528 --> 24:21.644
- No, it's I that made them.
- It's I that put 'em on.

24:21.821 --> 24:24.654
- You put 'em on wrong.
- No, no, no! They leak!

24:24.824 --> 24:27.020
A blind man could find more conch!

24:27.159 --> 24:29.879
You can't find your ass
with both hands!

24:30.038 --> 24:36.069
That's not fair! You go away, come
back a zombie, it's Christmas Eve.

24:36.378 --> 24:38.939
- We're working overtime cos of YOU!
- Hey!

24:44.636 --> 24:47.025
I'm sorry about your brother, man.

24:49.433 --> 24:52.231
Well, just...
just take it easy, will ya?

24:57.648 --> 24:59.321
Jake.

25:02.779 --> 25:05.418
C'mon, Jake, don't...
I don't want...

25:05.573 --> 25:09.408
- Oh! Put me down.
- I missed you, man!

25:09.620 --> 25:13.579
And then he wrote dirty words
all over the garage.

25:13.790 --> 25:17.100
He was... your daddy was five.
He was your age.

25:17.294 --> 25:19.329
- I'm almost six.
- So is Jake.

25:20.965 --> 25:24.116
Oh, look at that face.
OK, do the other one.

25:27.095 --> 25:29.484
Now that's closer to the real truth.

25:29.640 --> 25:33.599
Oh, you. This guy was always
getting into some sort of mischief.

25:33.811 --> 25:35.768
I got no doubt about that.

25:35.896 --> 25:39.492
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?
Did you ever spank him?

25:45.948 --> 25:47.619
Sharp shirt, Jake.

25:47.740 --> 25:50.858
Hey, may your sex life
be as busy as your shirt.

25:51.037 --> 25:53.312
Why, thank you.

25:53.456 --> 25:55.526
My tea set! I got my tea set!

25:55.666 --> 25:57.462
Oh, let me see!

25:57.584 --> 26:00.860
Every lovely lady
should have a tea set.

26:01.047 --> 26:03.880
It has a teapot
and cups and saucers.

26:04.049 --> 26:06.961
And a sugar bowl
and a creamer.

26:07.135 --> 26:11.287
Can I put real tea in it?
Yes, real tea.

26:11.515 --> 26:14.632
Can I make sandwiches?
Yes.

26:14.810 --> 26:18.008
Thea, we forgot
the Christmas carols.

26:18.187 --> 26:22.818
Carol from the grocery store?
Oh, will you stop it?

26:30.200 --> 26:31.917
I miss him, Mom.

26:34.538 --> 26:38.737
- I want you to change your work.
- Mom, please don't start that.

26:38.959 --> 26:42.554
- You could teach or write...
- I'm not gonna quit now.

26:48.594 --> 26:52.302
You're all I have left. I don't want
you working in the water.

26:56.101 --> 27:00.618
Mom, what I do is perfectly safe.

27:01.982 --> 27:05.179
At the moment,
we're collecting big snails.

27:08.404 --> 27:11.556
Jake and I are scientists.
We're almost PhDs.

27:11.743 --> 27:15.179
We know what we're doing.
There's nothing to worry about.

27:32.888 --> 27:34.322
Oh, great.

27:37.059 --> 27:41.495
And, well, we have to dig
the ditch really deep...

27:41.730 --> 27:45.724
so the water'll go all the way
around and we can swim in it.

27:45.943 --> 27:48.251
You're silly.

27:48.402 --> 27:52.157
You know what? Let's pretend
this is Buckingham Palace.

27:52.365 --> 27:56.518
And you'll be Princess Di,
and we'll have a parade with horses.

27:56.745 --> 27:59.657
And you'll ride in a golden carriage,
and we'll...

27:59.831 --> 28:03.222
And I can invite
Cinderella to the ball.

28:03.418 --> 28:06.854
She'll come
in a golden carriage, too.

28:07.047 --> 28:10.802
And we can have
cookies and punch and cake.

28:11.008 --> 28:14.206
And I can invite
Prince Charlie and...

28:14.387 --> 28:16.856
What's the name
of the other prince?

28:22.688 --> 28:27.045
Grandma? Grandma?

28:27.276 --> 28:28.754
What's wrong?

28:28.860 --> 28:30.737
Nothing.

28:30.862 --> 28:35.175
Oh, we better get this done
before the tide comes in.

28:35.408 --> 28:37.559
It's not nice to be evasive.

28:37.703 --> 28:41.092
My mother says that
to my father all the time.

28:42.624 --> 28:44.262
Hello, you two!

28:44.376 --> 28:45.889
Hello.

28:48.587 --> 28:50.499
I don't know why I fish here.

28:52.092 --> 28:54.367
I never catch anything.

28:54.511 --> 28:58.824
There must be a sign underwater -
"beware, Hoagie's about".

28:59.058 --> 29:02.847
- You drive the plane.
- Flies the plane.

29:03.061 --> 29:06.053
Mostly, it's like driving.

29:06.232 --> 29:08.143
What's that, an excavation?

29:08.275 --> 29:11.426
We're building a sand castle,
and you're invited for tea.

29:11.613 --> 29:13.763
You know why you got
no ambition?

29:16.533 --> 29:19.366
- Why is that, Jake?
- Your Norman Rockwell life.

29:19.536 --> 29:20.970
Norman Rockwell?

29:21.079 --> 29:23.718
That's precisely
your problem, my friend.

29:23.874 --> 29:26.342
You weren't exactly a deprived kid.

29:26.502 --> 29:29.859
I don't buy that
roots-rock-reggae bullshit.

29:30.047 --> 29:33.039
Cut that hair,
you're a three-piece suit.

29:33.215 --> 29:37.176
The bottom line is we got three
months left of work and no money.

29:37.387 --> 29:38.741
Spent it all on beer.

29:38.847 --> 29:43.285
Bahamian Fisheries Department
is not exactly Fort Knox, my friend.

29:43.517 --> 29:45.315
But, on the other hand,

29:45.437 --> 29:48.986
Office of Naval Research,
they've got money.

29:49.192 --> 29:51.103
No. Forget it.

29:51.235 --> 29:53.351
What do you mean? Money is money.

29:53.486 --> 29:58.162
- They put bombs on dolphins.
- What you talking about?

29:58.408 --> 30:01.241
I know a guy who got money
from them to study eels.

30:01.411 --> 30:04.006
It's hard to put a bomb
on an eel!

30:04.164 --> 30:06.473
Who rattled your cage? Michael, man!

30:06.625 --> 30:09.981
We're bustin' our bunghies
to get our degrees.

30:10.169 --> 30:12.479
I'm tired of all this paradise shit.

30:12.631 --> 30:14.826
It's getting on my last nerve, man.

30:14.966 --> 30:17.161
William. Look at you, boy.

30:17.302 --> 30:19.862
- What?
- A mental midget reading all day.

30:20.013 --> 30:23.529
If mediocrity were fattening,
you'd all be whales.

30:23.725 --> 30:25.238
Knock off that drummin'!

30:25.352 --> 30:28.867
Look at you, boy.
What's wrong with you?

30:29.064 --> 30:33.217
You think because you been to
university you're smart?

30:33.443 --> 30:36.958
I don't know
why I've told you all this.

30:37.155 --> 30:40.432
Sometimes talking
to a stranger is easier.

30:40.616 --> 30:44.087
I can't explain it.
It's just something I feel.

30:44.288 --> 30:47.280
I always listen to my feelings.

30:51.335 --> 30:55.727
I think I'm going crazy.
Nightmares and...

30:55.966 --> 30:57.957
Maybe it was an accident.

30:58.093 --> 30:59.846
It was no accident.

30:59.971 --> 31:01.802
I'm not saying you're wrong.

31:01.930 --> 31:05.560
I'm just saying that maybe
there are other possibilities.

31:05.767 --> 31:09.476
When it killed Sean, I knew
with certainty it had come for him.

31:09.688 --> 31:11.486
I knew that!

31:11.607 --> 31:13.120
I know it's coming.

31:15.027 --> 31:17.336
I know it's coming.

31:19.323 --> 31:21.711
What's it cost to ride on that plane?

31:21.867 --> 31:24.983
The water's coming in!
The water's coming in!

31:25.162 --> 31:27.995
Depends on where you want to go.

31:28.166 --> 31:30.599
- Doesn't matter.
- Hurry!

31:30.751 --> 31:33.948
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

31:34.130 --> 31:37.964
Oh! Oh, no! Oh! Oh!

31:39.384 --> 31:42.342
Take the wheel!
I'm sorry?

31:42.511 --> 31:45.549
- Take the wheel.
- No, I can't.

31:45.724 --> 31:48.034
- Sure, you can.
- I don't know how.

31:48.185 --> 31:50.824
Nobody does till they learn.

31:53.565 --> 31:54.998
What are you doing?

31:55.108 --> 31:58.146
Better take the wheel
or we'll be swimming soon.

31:58.319 --> 32:01.073
Whoa, take it easy!
Take it easy!

32:01.238 --> 32:04.356
Hold her gently.
She'll damn near fly herself.

32:11.165 --> 32:13.076
See? Just like driving a car.

32:13.210 --> 32:15.121
Where do I pull off the road?

32:15.254 --> 32:19.168
No, you're doing fine.
I'll keep you out of trouble.

32:19.384 --> 32:22.217
- Relax.
- Where are we going?

32:22.386 --> 32:25.298
One time, I was flying supplies
up the Amazon

32:25.472 --> 32:27.464
when I came down in the jungle.

32:27.599 --> 32:30.432
- You won't tell me?
- I was picked up by head-hunters,

32:30.602 --> 32:32.115
and taken to their chief.

32:32.229 --> 32:34.584
- You are impossible!
- He looked at me

32:34.732 --> 32:36.643
and took me in his hut.

32:36.776 --> 32:39.734
Inside his hut,
there was a long pole...

32:54.335 --> 32:56.007
What is all this?

32:56.127 --> 32:59.598
Just a little something
I arranged to cheer you up.

32:59.798 --> 33:01.278
- No, really.
- What?

33:01.383 --> 33:04.455
- Tell me, what is all this?
- A local festival.

33:04.637 --> 33:07.869
It's called a junkanoo.

33:08.056 --> 33:11.571
'I'm not hearing
anything up here, buddy.'

33:11.768 --> 33:15.523
How many have you tagged, exactly?
How many?

33:15.730 --> 33:19.929
Michael... stop busting my bunghie.

33:20.153 --> 33:23.623
Yeah, it's OK for you,
but not for me, huh?

33:23.822 --> 33:26.097
Have no fear, Jake is here.

33:26.241 --> 33:29.119
I just struck the mother lode.
I'm counting.

33:29.286 --> 33:33.166
'Watch yourself with
that fancy equipment, buddy.'

33:33.373 --> 33:36.366
Such a live wire'll
make your hair stick up funny.

33:36.542 --> 33:38.658
That's good, Michael. William?

33:38.795 --> 33:41.026
Yeah, there's no hope for that boy.

33:41.173 --> 33:44.563
Jake? Jake, that's a joke.

33:47.387 --> 33:48.980
Holy shit!

33:53.726 --> 33:55.956
We got a big fish down here, man.

33:56.104 --> 33:58.380
Oh, yeah? How big?

34:03.111 --> 34:04.340
- Jesus!
- Look out!

34:08.324 --> 34:09.759
What's wrong?

34:13.621 --> 34:15.021
Ellen?

34:19.460 --> 34:21.214
Jesus Christ!

34:25.801 --> 34:29.793
- Ellen, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing. I'm fine.

34:30.013 --> 34:32.652
- No, you're not.
- I'm terrific.

34:41.275 --> 34:42.549
Come on!

34:44.946 --> 34:47.255
Give it up!

34:47.405 --> 34:49.475
You can't keep doing this.

34:49.617 --> 34:53.690
- I can't keep doing THIS.
- You promised me a drink.

34:53.913 --> 34:58.271
Sharks come and go, Ellen.
People have nothing to do with it.

34:58.500 --> 35:03.370
- A drink with an umbrella in it.
- Ellen, give it up.

35:04.674 --> 35:06.710
Give it a kick in the arse.

35:06.842 --> 35:08.798
Get on with your life.

35:16.809 --> 35:18.801
I know what you've been through.

35:18.937 --> 35:21.770
Don't worry.
The nightmares'll go away.

35:26.111 --> 35:28.864
Give me my glasses, man.

35:29.031 --> 35:32.501
Boy, I ain't never seen
nothin' so big. Never!

35:32.702 --> 35:36.172
I was right next to Michael.
The thing went right past me!

35:36.371 --> 35:39.169
Should've gone for you, Jake.
Why did it come up?

35:39.332 --> 35:42.608
- What's it doing in warm water?
- What's the difference?

35:42.836 --> 35:46.671
It's only a shark.
A big, big, beautiful shark.

35:46.882 --> 35:49.680
And it's ours.
Don't say anything to anyone.

35:49.843 --> 35:54.918
Fishermen would try to kill it.
Michael, we got us a great white.

35:55.182 --> 35:57.332
Now we gonna do some real research.

35:57.476 --> 36:01.265
Do me a favour, don't say
anything about this to my mom.

36:03.565 --> 36:07.195
Hey, man, I didn't mean to,
you know, flap my lips, eh?

36:31.467 --> 36:33.503
So...
So?

36:33.637 --> 36:37.596
I said to him,
"Where's the disinfectant?"

36:41.853 --> 36:44.004
He said, "I've left it in town."

36:44.147 --> 36:46.867
So I said,
"What are we gonna do?"

36:47.025 --> 36:50.301
So he says,
"I'll tell you what we'll do.

36:50.487 --> 36:54.640
"Come back at lunchtime, all the
flies will be in the kitchen."

36:57.328 --> 36:59.888
Come to bed.

37:02.291 --> 37:04.247
He took her sightseeing.

37:05.419 --> 37:06.932
Well, you work. I work.

37:07.044 --> 37:10.878
She needs someone to help her
take her mind off things.

37:25.188 --> 37:28.465
I'll help you take YOUR mind
off things, sailor.

37:40.787 --> 37:42.618
It's soaking.

37:44.166 --> 37:46.805
Thank you.

37:50.297 --> 37:52.175
Good night.

37:56.761 --> 37:58.592
Good night.

38:20.452 --> 38:21.726
Louisa.

38:21.828 --> 38:24.502
It's OK, Jake.
I'll check on the table.

38:26.625 --> 38:30.380
- OK, everything rides.
-Ooh, it's Hoagie!

38:30.587 --> 38:32.737
Hey, come on, I wanna see this.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.951
Oh, that's Hoagie, all right.

38:38.595 --> 38:41.109
Everything on the line.

38:41.265 --> 38:44.302
- You're not betting it all?
- All or nothing at all.

38:44.476 --> 38:47.354
- Here, do you want to throw for me?
- No!

38:47.521 --> 38:49.671
Now get ready. Are you ready?

39:03.287 --> 39:06.438
- I guess that's bad?
- Depends on your point of view.

39:06.623 --> 39:09.581
Ooh, look at that. Come here.

39:09.793 --> 39:12.592
Ooh, look at you. You look great!

39:15.133 --> 39:16.565
It's on the house.

39:16.675 --> 39:19.269
I knew there was a reason
I could afford this.

39:19.427 --> 39:20.780
Thank you, Shirley!

39:20.887 --> 39:25.166
My father used to say, "Jake,
you got two loves in your life -

39:25.392 --> 39:27.986
"what you do and who you're with."

39:29.479 --> 39:33.029
- Happy birthday, Louisa.
- Happy birthday!

39:33.233 --> 39:36.306
- And a Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year!

39:36.486 --> 39:39.321
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

39:39.489 --> 39:41.958
Don't go weak in the knees
on me tonight, boy.

39:42.116 --> 39:44.756
You're gonna need
all the strength you got.

39:44.913 --> 39:46.983
I knew a one-armed piano player,

39:47.122 --> 39:49.716
took two minutes
to play the Minute Waltz.

39:52.294 --> 39:55.843
Watch how you talk.
Michael and I are about to be famous.

39:56.048 --> 39:57.322
- Tell 'em.
- Jake!

39:57.425 --> 39:59.575
No job talk. You promised.

39:59.718 --> 40:01.868
You promised.

40:02.011 --> 40:04.162
Right.

40:04.306 --> 40:06.695
Would you risk
a dance with me, madam?

40:06.850 --> 40:10.286
- You'll be sorry.
- So will you. I have two right feet.

40:10.479 --> 40:12.709
That's good, I have two left.

40:12.856 --> 40:14.369
Well, that's a set.

40:27.287 --> 40:29.755
A little quiet tonight.

40:29.914 --> 40:32.349
- New Year's blues?
- No, not at all.

40:32.502 --> 40:35.574
Come on. It's my party.

40:35.754 --> 40:40.145
He's just Michael, he's startin' to
count them damn conch in his sleep.

40:41.843 --> 40:43.118
Excuse me.

40:54.438 --> 40:56.669
- Mind if I cut in?
- Please.

40:56.817 --> 40:58.967
The world would be a better place

40:59.110 --> 41:01.625
if more sons danced
with their mothers.

41:07.829 --> 41:10.297
Michael, stop pouting.

41:10.455 --> 41:15.165
You look like you did when you were
six and didn't get what you wanted.

41:15.419 --> 41:18.331
I like him. I enjoy his company.

41:18.506 --> 41:22.625
Yeah. I don't like him
chasing around after you.

41:22.843 --> 41:25.073
I don't trust him.

41:25.262 --> 41:28.698
He's not chasing.
You are being ridiculous.

41:28.890 --> 41:31.688
I've been a pain in the ass
and I'm sorry.

41:31.852 --> 41:34.446
I'm not gonna bother you
about your work.

41:34.605 --> 41:36.993
- You're not a pain.
- Let me finish.

41:37.189 --> 41:39.659
I've been rehearsing this all day.

41:39.859 --> 41:43.330
Sean's death almost killed me.
I'll never get over it,

41:43.530 --> 41:46.682
but I refuse to let myself
be run by an obsession.

41:46.867 --> 41:49.985
I can't keep on believing
it was intentional.

41:50.163 --> 41:53.236
I finally figured it out.

41:53.415 --> 41:55.371
Good.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.139
That's it, "good"?

41:57.252 --> 42:00.085
I thought you'd break out
the champagne.

42:00.256 --> 42:02.566
No, I-I-I'm pleased.

42:02.717 --> 42:06.472
Come on. Show your mother
what a good dancer you are.

42:18.523 --> 42:20.754
Where is everybody?

42:20.901 --> 42:23.018
Down here!

42:27.490 --> 42:31.005
- Where is Clarence and William?
- I gave them the day off.

42:31.203 --> 42:33.239
What for? We got a job to finish.

42:33.372 --> 42:35.680
Why are you making a transmitter?

42:35.832 --> 42:38.028
It's all part of the master plan.

42:38.168 --> 42:40.363
We're gonna test it out right now.

42:40.504 --> 42:44.783
We're gonna learn about
its motor systems, its heart rate.

42:47.510 --> 42:50.183
We're going to study
a magnificent animal

42:50.348 --> 42:52.909
no one knows that much about.

42:53.058 --> 42:57.211
As the sun sets, we bid a
fond farewell to the family of conch.

42:57.436 --> 42:59.905
What the hell
are you talking about?

43:00.064 --> 43:04.456
We wrap it up and hand it in.
Why is your heart stronger than mine?

43:04.695 --> 43:07.766
We don't write up anything
till we're finished.

43:07.948 --> 43:10.018
When I was a boy, my father said,

43:10.157 --> 43:13.593
"Never do anything today
you can put off till tomorrow."

43:13.829 --> 43:16.024
Them conch gonna be there tomorrow.

43:16.163 --> 43:19.474
- When we got the grant, it said...
- No, when I got the grant.

43:19.668 --> 43:22.626
- OK, when I signed on, I...
- When I invited you.

43:22.839 --> 43:25.875
- We got the grant together.
- When we got it together.

43:26.049 --> 43:30.566
We got three months' work left
on this. We can't write a report.

43:30.846 --> 43:35.078
Michael, we got a rare bird here.
You know that, huh?

43:35.308 --> 43:38.778
Great white don't come down
to the Bahamas, never.

43:38.979 --> 43:41.254
Do we let an opportunity
just swim away?

43:41.398 --> 43:43.196
My name's on the report.

43:43.318 --> 43:47.630
A half-assed job, I don't get
my doctorate and neither do you.

43:47.863 --> 43:51.139
I thought we were planning
a rosy future together.

43:51.325 --> 43:53.042
So did I.

43:56.246 --> 43:58.316
Hey! Hey!

43:58.458 --> 44:00.449
Michael?

44:00.584 --> 44:03.019
Anybody home in there at all?

44:03.171 --> 44:06.368
You better beam down to Earth
with the rest of us.

44:06.549 --> 44:10.622
If that shark's still in the water,
it won't be there forever.

44:10.845 --> 44:13.838
It's gonna figure out
the water's too warm.

44:14.014 --> 44:19.532
Look at me and tell me you don't want
to study that fish as much as I do.

44:19.811 --> 44:23.963
Michael? Huh?
This is what we trained for.

44:24.191 --> 44:27.307
This is what we studied
them damn books for.

44:27.486 --> 44:30.319
Remember,
my name goes on that report, too.

44:30.489 --> 44:33.481
It's as important to me
as it is to you, right?

44:33.659 --> 44:36.332
All right,
you like them damn snails?

44:36.536 --> 44:39.768
All right, all right,
I'll make you a deal. Listen.

44:39.956 --> 44:42.834
We study that shark,
just for a few days,

44:43.002 --> 44:45.470
and it's back
to your lovely snails.

44:45.629 --> 44:48.541
Now that's fair, man. That's fair.

44:48.715 --> 44:51.832
Come on, indulge me with it, eh?

44:56.848 --> 44:59.317
I don't know shit about electronics.

44:59.476 --> 45:01.865
Boy, you don't know shit
about anything.

45:02.020 --> 45:04.170
It's time you learned.

45:04.314 --> 45:07.272
I'll teach you how to wear your hair,
how to dance.

45:07.442 --> 45:09.718
How to box. Come on, follow me.

45:09.861 --> 45:11.977
Get your butt down here, man.

45:17.744 --> 45:21.624
This is the third time
you've forgotten to take it out.

45:21.832 --> 45:25.303
- I got a lot on my mind.
- You can't remember when they come?

45:25.502 --> 45:27.300
My brain is shrinking...

45:27.420 --> 45:30.493
Don't give me that
preoccupied scientist crap.

45:30.674 --> 45:32.949
I'm getting ready
for a big event!

45:33.093 --> 45:36.166
I thought artists worked
with their subconscious.

45:36.345 --> 45:38.780
How come it's my responsibility?

45:38.932 --> 45:40.490
Because.

45:42.644 --> 45:47.479
Oh. OK, now I understand.
All you had to do was explain it.

45:49.609 --> 45:51.918
I take out the garbage... because.

45:52.070 --> 45:54.459
I'm glad we
got that straightened out.

45:54.615 --> 45:57.334
We don't have anything
straightened out.

46:06.209 --> 46:08.485
You're uptight about something.

46:11.257 --> 46:13.054
What's wrong?

46:13.175 --> 46:16.804
Why should there be anything wrong?
I'm enjoying my day off,

46:17.012 --> 46:21.643
my wife starts yelling at me
about the garbage.

46:23.770 --> 46:25.521
What are we arguing about?

46:28.441 --> 46:31.558
I don't know. I...

46:33.446 --> 46:35.402
I don't know.

46:35.529 --> 46:37.168
Hey.

46:39.285 --> 46:43.039
- No fair, I'm not armed.
- Then don't come any closer.

46:43.248 --> 46:48.083
- Turn it off. Off.
- No. I have work.

46:54.217 --> 46:57.095
I've always wanted to make love
to an angry welder.

46:57.261 --> 47:00.936
I've dreamed of nothing else
since I was a small boy.

47:09.939 --> 47:13.569
- Shut the door.
- Uh-huh. Later.

47:17.072 --> 47:19.744
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Michael!

47:19.908 --> 47:21.580
Shut the door!

47:33.505 --> 47:36.259
You sure you've
done this before?

47:36.425 --> 47:40.464
Oh, yeah. Lots of times.
Trust your Uncle Jake, eh?

47:40.679 --> 47:43.034
It's always worked, huh?

47:43.181 --> 47:45.695
Well, uh... thus far.

47:52.316 --> 47:54.624
OK, take me out.

47:56.154 --> 47:57.985
Little more.

48:24.306 --> 48:26.581
There it is! Comin'! It's comin'!

48:31.313 --> 48:34.544
- You remember how to pull rope, eh?
- Yeah.

49:14.982 --> 49:17.415
Yes! You got him, man!

49:17.566 --> 49:19.603
Ah! Now would be a good time!

49:21.780 --> 49:24.055
Did you see that, man?

49:24.241 --> 49:26.119
Let's try to follow it.

49:26.244 --> 49:30.635
Now we're gonna see if Uncle Jake's
equipment's really working for us.

49:35.961 --> 49:37.757
Michael!

49:48.890 --> 49:51.644
- Our little island agrees with you.
- I have my own little island.

49:51.810 --> 49:55.519
But it's so cold in the winter.
I tried winter once.

49:55.730 --> 49:58.927
Here we are. Burlington, Vermont.

49:59.110 --> 50:02.102
I flew a run to New York. Oh!

50:02.278 --> 50:05.873
I have a bone in my left foot
that hasn't thawed yet.

50:06.073 --> 50:09.861
- When I was a small boy...
- Not hard to imagine, by the way.

50:10.078 --> 50:12.717
...I dreamed of always being warm.

50:12.873 --> 50:15.627
What do you want?
Whatever we had last time.

50:15.834 --> 50:17.426
Two Bahama Mamas, please.

50:17.544 --> 50:21.015
- Stay. I'll take time off.
- You always take time off.

50:21.214 --> 50:23.855
I like to travel.
I'll nick the plane again.

50:24.009 --> 50:27.558
- Won't you get in trouble?
- Not if he doesn't find out.

50:27.763 --> 50:32.120
It's just a hop down to the
Caribbean. We'll spend a few days.

50:32.351 --> 50:35.263
There must be a lot of ladies
who'd be glad to go.

50:35.437 --> 50:37.110
Yeah, there are, but...

50:38.440 --> 50:41.398
I've grown tired
of one-way conversations.

50:44.988 --> 50:49.062
I have an irresistible
urge to kiss you, Ellen Brody.

50:49.284 --> 50:50.513
Why?

50:50.618 --> 50:53.928
Because it would not
occur to you why.

50:57.166 --> 50:58.839
Blushing suits you.

50:58.961 --> 51:03.876
- Lord... I'm sorry.
- It's nothing to be sorry about.

51:04.133 --> 51:08.286
No, this whole thing...
The whole idea is preposterous.

51:08.511 --> 51:10.626
I don't think so.

51:12.016 --> 51:15.167
- You sure you don't need glasses?
- I'm a pilot.

51:15.352 --> 51:17.308
My vision is perfect.

51:22.942 --> 51:26.458
What are we getting?
Nine knots.

51:26.656 --> 51:28.851
Shit! We should be keeping up.

51:28.991 --> 51:32.222
- You sure the throttle's open?
- Wide open.

51:33.619 --> 51:37.214
Come on, you overgrown goldfish!
Come to Uncle Jake.

51:39.459 --> 51:42.213
- How long have you known Hoagie?
- What?

51:42.379 --> 51:44.097
How long have you known Hoagie?

51:44.215 --> 51:46.571
- What's he got to do with it?
- How long?

51:46.717 --> 51:49.105
Since he got here.
Bring it to starboard!

51:53.140 --> 51:54.459
When did he get here?

51:54.558 --> 51:56.514
- Who?
- Hoagie!

51:56.643 --> 51:59.111
Christ!
One day he was just here, that's all.

51:59.271 --> 52:02.581
What do you know about him?

52:06.571 --> 52:08.004
He's after my mother.

52:08.113 --> 52:12.265
- What's so funny?
- He's not good enough for her, eh?

52:12.492 --> 52:15.211
I agree. I'd send her home right now.

52:15.370 --> 52:17.645
Bring her about,
we're going the wrong way.

52:17.789 --> 52:21.260
I mean, some of these pilots
are flying drugs down here.

52:21.460 --> 52:24.930
- He's always going off somewhere.
- Bring her about, now!

52:25.130 --> 52:28.885
- I am!
- Hurry, man, we're losin' him!

52:29.092 --> 52:31.402
- You must know something.
- Christ!

52:31.553 --> 52:34.829
He likes gambling,
he likes women, don't bother me!

52:35.014 --> 52:37.324
- He flies charter...
- Damn! We lost him!

52:39.604 --> 52:41.515
Maybe your gear crapped out.

52:41.647 --> 52:45.242
Maybe you crapped out,
flappin' your lips about Hoagie.

52:54.993 --> 52:56.473
Maybe he's gone.

52:59.289 --> 53:02.009
All right, Mr Fish.

53:02.168 --> 53:04.728
We'll come back and find you
tomorrow.

53:15.264 --> 53:17.300
All he did was kiss me!

53:17.474 --> 53:21.229
- Well, that's a beginning.
- A beginning of what?

53:21.436 --> 53:23.906
To whatever happens next.

53:24.064 --> 53:25.895
Oh.

53:26.024 --> 53:30.018
I used to think I could handle these
situations once I was grown up,

53:30.237 --> 53:32.671
but I don't even know
if he's serious.

53:32.822 --> 53:36.292
Mmm, give it some time, Ellen.
See what happens.

53:36.493 --> 53:39.930
Well, part of me wanted to
go off with him.

53:40.122 --> 53:41.714
I couldn't.

53:44.918 --> 53:47.193
I don't know why he wants me.

53:47.337 --> 53:48.975
Maybe he's got good taste.

53:49.090 --> 53:52.002
He hasn't spent
much time with a woman like you.

53:52.175 --> 53:56.294
I don't know what he thinks.
Or what I think. This is so silly!

53:56.513 --> 53:58.903
I feel too old to be in this thing.

53:59.057 --> 54:02.414
I hope not. I am counting on
a long, happy sex life.

54:07.983 --> 54:11.055
You said it wasn't polite
to interrupt people.

54:12.529 --> 54:14.087
Yes, I did.

54:14.199 --> 54:17.634
- It's time for tea, Grandma.
- Oh, I almost forgot.

54:17.826 --> 54:20.341
I didn't.
I put everything in my room.

54:20.495 --> 54:22.532
My teddy bear's joining us.

54:33.133 --> 54:34.851
Michael?

54:34.968 --> 54:39.120
Michael, what is it?

54:40.682 --> 54:42.719
Nothing, just a stupid dream.

54:45.312 --> 54:47.143
Hmm.

56:52.982 --> 56:55.577
Time for bed, peanut.

56:55.734 --> 56:58.328
- Oh, no!
- Yep. Daddy's got homework.

56:58.488 --> 57:00.877
- But you let me last night.
- Yeah, yeah.

57:01.031 --> 57:03.181
Mommy's waiting to read a story.

57:04.660 --> 57:07.379
- Good night, sweetheart!
- Good night.

57:07.537 --> 57:10.654
Night. Let's put up our feet
and shoot the breeze,

57:10.832 --> 57:13.142
or whatever it is beer drinkers do.

57:13.294 --> 57:16.047
I, uh, I got to put
together this report, Ma.

57:16.213 --> 57:19.489
Jake says don't do today
what you can put off tomorrow.

57:19.675 --> 57:22.189
Yeah, Jake's got a lot of those.

57:22.345 --> 57:26.258
I'm leaving in a few days.
I don't want to go with you unhappy.

57:26.473 --> 57:27.792
I'm not unhappy.

57:27.891 --> 57:30.929
I saw you and Thea.
You looked just like your father.

57:31.103 --> 57:34.413
Do you remember when
you guys used to imitate him?

57:34.607 --> 57:37.883
Mom, I gotta get this finished, OK?

57:38.067 --> 57:41.662
- I worry about you.
- There's nothing to worry about.

57:41.862 --> 57:43.740
I'm your mother. It's my job.

57:43.865 --> 57:47.415
Just cos you're a man
doesn't mean I've retired.

57:47.619 --> 57:51.533
I've worked on MY smile.
It's... it's your turn.

57:54.502 --> 57:55.696
That's better.

57:58.422 --> 58:00.218
'Blump, blump! Blump, blump!

58:00.340 --> 58:03.492
- 'Blump, blump! Blump, blump! '
- Jake, knock it off!

58:03.677 --> 58:07.226
Blump, blump. OK,
just don't try to renege on our deal.

58:07.432 --> 58:10.822
Half a day on the snails,
then a half a day on the shark.

58:11.018 --> 58:15.455
You got 17 more minutes, then we're
gonna go look for that shark.

58:15.689 --> 58:20.160
It's a big ocean. We could
spend the rest of our lives looking.

58:20.402 --> 58:22.040
'We're gonna find him.'

58:22.154 --> 58:25.624
'I got about a half a dozen.
I'll tag 'em and be right up.

58:25.824 --> 58:27.780
'You, uh, hearin' anything? '

58:27.911 --> 58:32.223
Nothin' at all. Just another cool,
calm, tickly day in the Bahamas.

58:32.456 --> 58:36.369
Just stay within a quarter mile.
I got a three-mile monitor radius.

58:36.584 --> 58:40.941
Within three miles, there's plenty of
time to beam your ugly ass up.

58:52.684 --> 58:53.958
Michael, I got him.

58:54.061 --> 58:57.417
'He's comin' towards you.
You better get out now.'

58:57.606 --> 58:59.915
All right, I'm comin', I'm comin'.

59:25.634 --> 59:26.987
Shit!

59:30.472 --> 59:32.508
Jake!

59:34.517 --> 59:36.270
Jake!

59:37.980 --> 59:42.212
Michael! Michael!

59:44.194 --> 59:46.105
'Michael! '

59:50.908 --> 59:54.982
Michael, what's goin' on?
Michael, can you hear me?

59:58.166 --> 01:00:01.318
'Michael! Michael, can you hear me? '

01:00:28.906 --> 01:00:30.737
Michael!

01:01:44.606 --> 01:01:47.359
Son of a bitch! Oh, shit!

01:01:47.526 --> 01:01:49.005
Jesus Christ!

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:52.929
Ah!

01:01:57.286 --> 01:01:59.401
Uh!

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.877
It's over there!

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:08.525
Shit! Get the bang sticks,
we're goin' down.

01:02:08.671 --> 01:02:11.232
- They're no good.
- Get another one!

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.713
Come on, come on! Michael!

01:02:45.876 --> 01:02:48.994
- Get him up! Watch his arm!
- Lay him down gently!

01:02:49.172 --> 01:02:52.562
We need a tourniquet
to stop his bleeding.

01:02:52.759 --> 01:02:55.353
- Try this!
- Get the wet suit off.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:57.741
Keep cool, don't worry.

01:02:57.888 --> 01:03:01.677
Michael, how are you?
I think he may be in shock.

01:03:01.892 --> 01:03:03.769
Clarence, move it!

01:03:39.054 --> 01:03:41.808
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, what you doin', man?

01:03:41.974 --> 01:03:45.569
No one goes in the water
till we know where that fish is.

01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:48.444
You fall off the horse,
you get right back on.

01:03:48.605 --> 01:03:51.723
Hell, what kind of bullcrap
you talkin'? Huh?

01:03:51.899 --> 01:03:56.052
- Anybody's in the water, it's me.
- Jake, I'm gonna go down.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.116
All right, so what about Carla's gig?
It's almost time, man.

01:04:05.956 --> 01:04:08.834
Michael, I can't just let you
go back down.

01:04:11.461 --> 01:04:13.180
I'm scared shitless.

01:04:13.298 --> 01:04:16.734
What the hell do I do
if I can't go back in that water?

01:04:19.803 --> 01:04:21.316
All right, be careful.

01:04:34.568 --> 01:04:38.117
Clarence, get up on that shack.
Give us some lookout.

01:04:38.323 --> 01:04:42.634
- I hope he knows what he's doing.
- He's doin' what he's got to do.

01:04:58.384 --> 01:05:01.217
Jake, are you gettin'
anything on the shark?

01:05:06.058 --> 01:05:08.448
No, everything's cool.

01:05:08.602 --> 01:05:11.958
I'm thinkin' about yesterday.
It's probably a mistake.

01:05:12.146 --> 01:05:15.856
- He was hungry. You look tasty.
- But how come only me?

01:05:16.068 --> 01:05:20.460
- Maybe he just like white meat.
- You're a funny guy, Jake.

01:05:24.408 --> 01:05:25.728
Jesus!

01:05:37.839 --> 01:05:42.072
It is about art
that I wish to speak today.

01:05:43.346 --> 01:05:47.862
The raw material of art
surrounds us all,

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:52.253
catching in the net that each
and every one of us casts

01:05:52.478 --> 01:05:54.834
into the current of life.

01:05:56.358 --> 01:05:59.714
- But it takes the art...
- Where the hell are they?

01:05:59.903 --> 01:06:01.622
They'll be here.

01:06:01.738 --> 01:06:03.888
- Can I go on the banana boat?
- Shh!

01:06:04.032 --> 01:06:07.230
Margaret's going.
She's with her mother.

01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:09.719
- OK.
- Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

01:06:09.871 --> 01:06:12.591
- Thea, you be careful.
- I will, I will!

01:06:12.748 --> 01:06:15.821
- Thea!
- It's OK. Banana boats are fun.

01:06:17.045 --> 01:06:21.163
Oh, we should be so lucky.
I wish we were out with her playin'.

01:06:21.383 --> 01:06:23.613
Margaret, wait for me!

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.152
"Get to the point, man,"
as my wife now says.

01:06:30.392 --> 01:06:36.025
OK. Well, in short, art is grease
for the wheel of life.

01:06:36.315 --> 01:06:42.425
Today we are privileged
to dedicate a work of art.

01:06:42.738 --> 01:06:44.410
Carla Brody,

01:06:44.531 --> 01:06:49.286
an artist of growing reputation,

01:06:49.536 --> 01:06:55.645
was commissioned to express
our way of life in permanent form...

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.510
to show the world what we all know
right here on this beach:

01:06:59.712 --> 01:07:02.545
That it is better in the Bahamas.

01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:10.597
- Absolutely.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Carla Brody!

01:07:10.975 --> 01:07:14.730
Thank you, Commissioner Witherspoon,
Mrs Witherspoon.

01:07:22.486 --> 01:07:24.238
Thea!

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.553
Oh, my God!

01:07:35.165 --> 01:07:36.392
Thea!

01:07:39.294 --> 01:07:42.366
Stop! Come back! Bring her back!

01:07:44.715 --> 01:07:45.989
Oh, my God!

01:08:00.899 --> 01:08:03.573
Stop! Thea! Thea!

01:08:03.735 --> 01:08:05.010
Thea!

01:08:05.112 --> 01:08:07.262
Somebody do something!

01:08:12.327 --> 01:08:13.556
Thea!

01:08:19.751 --> 01:08:21.069
Oh, no! My God!

01:08:32.096 --> 01:08:35.372
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Thea!

01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:40.899
Somebody get a doctor!
Get a doctor now!

01:08:41.106 --> 01:08:42.984
Quickly!

01:09:48.756 --> 01:09:51.953
- I'm sorry I missed you.
- Where have you been?

01:09:52.135 --> 01:09:54.127
What's the matter? What happened?

01:09:54.263 --> 01:09:56.299
Thea was attacked by a shark.

01:09:56.431 --> 01:09:58.343
Oh, my God.

01:09:59.518 --> 01:10:02.397
The doctor said she should be OK.
She's in shock.

01:10:02.562 --> 01:10:06.238
Sweetheart? Sweetheart?

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.353
I'm so sorry.
I should've known. Jesus.

01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:11.401
Should've known what?

01:10:15.117 --> 01:10:17.677
- We tried to keep track of him.
- Of...

01:10:17.827 --> 01:10:19.704
The shark.

01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:22.391
- You knew?
- Yeah. Thought it went away.

01:10:22.541 --> 01:10:25.499
- Came after me.
- She could've been killed. You knew?

01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:28.706
And you didn't tell us?
You let your mother think...

01:10:28.882 --> 01:10:30.075
Where is she?

01:10:30.174 --> 01:10:32.814
- How could you do that?
- Where's my mother?

01:10:32.968 --> 01:10:35.436
- Where's my mother?
- Why didn't you tell us?

01:10:35.596 --> 01:10:38.986
- Where's Jake?
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

01:10:42.185 --> 01:10:43.982
Michael!

01:10:47.565 --> 01:10:49.044
Jake!

01:10:49.151 --> 01:10:51.585
- Jake!
- What?

01:10:51.737 --> 01:10:54.091
Come on! I need you! Hurry up!

01:11:14.217 --> 01:11:17.051
Hoagie! Did you see our boat?

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.055
- I just got here.
- My mother took it.

01:11:20.225 --> 01:11:24.013
- I hope she's a good sailor.
- A shark attacked Thea.

01:11:24.227 --> 01:11:26.219
She went after the damn thing.

01:11:26.396 --> 01:11:29.707
- She's gone after it?
- Yeah, we gotta stop her.

01:11:29.899 --> 01:11:33.654
In that?
Lt'll take all day in that bathtub.

01:11:33.862 --> 01:11:34.898
Got a better idea?

01:11:39.868 --> 01:11:41.426
I'll radio her position.

01:11:41.538 --> 01:11:44.689
The rescue boats will pick her up,
so don't worry.

01:11:44.872 --> 01:11:46.021
She'll be fine.

01:11:46.124 --> 01:11:49.083
She'll never find that bloody shark.
We couldn't.

01:11:49.253 --> 01:11:52.325
It'll find her.
What do you mean?

01:11:52.507 --> 01:11:55.179
She said it was coming.

01:11:55.342 --> 01:11:58.539
- What do you mean?
- What do you know?

01:11:58.721 --> 01:12:01.998
She thinks the shark
that killed Martin and Sean

01:12:02.182 --> 01:12:03.774
is following the family.

01:12:03.892 --> 01:12:07.124
Hey, he's not talkin'
about our shark, eh?

01:12:07.313 --> 01:12:10.191
What do you do when
you're not flying people?

01:12:10.399 --> 01:12:13.233
I deliver laundry.

01:12:13.402 --> 01:12:17.953
Hold on. What's that?
Let's have a look.

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:25.979
Oh.

01:12:27.873 --> 01:12:30.263
It's a big ocean out there.

01:13:08.289 --> 01:13:10.724
Can't this thing go any faster?

01:13:10.875 --> 01:13:13.867
Any faster, this thing'll be
a flying Cuisinart

01:13:14.047 --> 01:13:16.037
and we'll be diced into oblivion.

01:13:44.284 --> 01:13:46.594
Come and get me,
you son of a bitch.

01:13:52.876 --> 01:13:55.437
There she is.
That's her right there.

01:13:58.006 --> 01:13:59.597
Is that what I think it is?

01:14:01.844 --> 01:14:04.039
- Mom...
- Hold on!

01:14:14.856 --> 01:14:16.529
Oh!

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:35.135
'Thomas, you there?
This is Zero-Papa-Alpha here.'

01:14:35.335 --> 01:14:37.485
'Hoagie, where are you? '

01:14:37.629 --> 01:14:41.942
12 miles southeast of Emerald Key.
Look for Neptune's Folly.'

01:14:45.012 --> 01:14:48.607
I need two boats fast and somebody
who can kill a shark - a big one.

01:14:48.807 --> 01:14:51.879
'What're you doing? '
Practising landing.

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:54.449
Hang on to your socks, lads.

01:14:54.605 --> 01:14:57.164
Wait! You sure you know
how to do this?

01:14:57.316 --> 01:15:00.865
Of course not!
What kind of pilot do you think I am?

01:15:15.168 --> 01:15:17.045
- Christ!
- Hell, not half bad.

01:15:17.169 --> 01:15:19.080
Get out, I'll keep it busy.

01:15:19.212 --> 01:15:23.206
No, it'll come for the plane's
electromagnetic impulse.

01:15:23.425 --> 01:15:25.986
Get the bloody hell out!

01:15:26.136 --> 01:15:27.330
Michael!

01:15:37.773 --> 01:15:43.131
Damn passengers! You're all the same.
Complain, complain...

01:15:43.402 --> 01:15:44.915
Oh, shit!

01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:48.484
Hoagie!

01:15:51.494 --> 01:15:54.328
Hoagie! Hoagie!

01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:18.223
Why'd you come out here?

01:16:21.607 --> 01:16:23.199
Why'd you come out here?

01:16:23.317 --> 01:16:25.467
- Why did you bring him?
- Mom, Mom!

01:16:25.612 --> 01:16:28.411
- Why'd you take the boat?
- It kept coming!

01:16:28.574 --> 01:16:31.930
- Didn't you realise?
- There was nothing else to do.

01:16:32.161 --> 01:16:35.358
- You shouldn't have done it.
- I tried to tell you.

01:16:35.539 --> 01:16:37.928
I tried.

01:16:42.754 --> 01:16:45.632
Hey!
Give me a hand, for Christ's sake!

01:16:45.799 --> 01:16:48.758
- Hoagie!
- How the hell did you do that, man?

01:16:48.927 --> 01:16:51.725
- It wasn't easy, believe me.
- Get him up.

01:16:55.183 --> 01:16:57.220
You all right, man?

01:16:57.351 --> 01:17:00.583
- Oh! Bloody hell.
- Get it started!

01:17:00.773 --> 01:17:03.732
- The breath on that thing!
- You are alive!

01:17:03.899 --> 01:17:06.333
Let's get out of here,
Ellen Brody. Oh!

01:17:06.485 --> 01:17:08.761
Good, this thing's still working.

01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:12.265
That's your engine, pal.
I'll have a look.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.316
Oh, shit, he's close, man.

01:17:18.457 --> 01:17:21.574
- What is that sound?
- The shark's heartbeat.

01:17:21.752 --> 01:17:25.462
Hoagie, try to finish.
Michael, gimme a hand, I got an idea.

01:17:25.672 --> 01:17:29.586
We're taking water down here.
Ellen, start pumping here.

01:17:30.844 --> 01:17:33.756
Ellen! Get the bilge pump!

01:17:33.931 --> 01:17:38.321
Take the radio transmitter out
and hook it to the strobe.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:41.996
- We gotta get the engine started!
- Just do it!

01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:45.147
We're gonna feed that big boy
a meal he won't forget.

01:17:45.317 --> 01:17:49.630
You better have something good going.
We've got a rotten hose.

01:17:49.863 --> 01:17:53.139
There's a spare one.
What you wanna do with this?

01:17:53.325 --> 01:17:58.354
I'm riggin' the receiver. We get it
inside that bastard and set it off.

01:17:58.622 --> 01:18:02.581
I got it. We rig an antenna on this,
we can shock the hell out of him.

01:18:02.793 --> 01:18:04.272
Right! You're learning.

01:18:07.756 --> 01:18:09.235
He's getting closer!

01:18:09.341 --> 01:18:13.972
They spend their lives looking for
food, they don't care what it is.

01:18:14.221 --> 01:18:17.055
Maybe he's got indigestion.
He's eaten my plane!

01:18:19.225 --> 01:18:21.341
It's not food he's after.

01:18:21.477 --> 01:18:24.310
Michael, turn on your switch.
I need a test.

01:18:24.481 --> 01:18:27.360
- Anybody tell you you're nuts?
- All the time.

01:18:27.526 --> 01:18:30.484
If it responds
to external electrical impulse,

01:18:30.654 --> 01:18:34.363
it might respond to one inside -
confuse him, drive him crazy.

01:18:34.575 --> 01:18:37.214
OK, a test... Good.

01:18:41.331 --> 01:18:45.040
You'd better get up here!
The heartbeat's stopped!

01:18:50.881 --> 01:18:52.474
Shit.

01:18:52.593 --> 01:18:56.107
Either he's gone
or your gear's crapped out again.

01:18:57.347 --> 01:19:01.580
That's bull. My equipment
don't crap out. He'll be back.

01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:04.484
Get me the boat hook.

01:19:04.646 --> 01:19:09.243
Maybe he had a heart attack.
Humans are full of cholesterol.

01:19:09.484 --> 01:19:11.555
- Give me that.
- Shit! Where is he?

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:16.693
Give me that line, Michael.
Right there.

01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:19.343
There he is!

01:19:21.329 --> 01:19:23.798
Ellen, try the engine.

01:19:25.291 --> 01:19:27.600
Ellen! Try to start the engine!

01:19:32.549 --> 01:19:35.542
Son of a bitch.
Let's get out of here.

01:19:35.719 --> 01:19:39.758
No, it's too late, Hoagie.
Give me a hard port.

01:19:39.974 --> 01:19:41.692
Right!

01:19:41.808 --> 01:19:46.484
Here, give me that.
No! No time for that!

01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:49.688
Jake! You can't go out there
without a line!

01:19:52.570 --> 01:19:55.290
Keep it steady.
It's gonna come back!

01:20:12.798 --> 01:20:15.915
Damn thing's disappeared. He's gone!

01:20:52.838 --> 01:20:59.027
Jake!

01:21:27.457 --> 01:21:30.608
We're taking too much water.
It'll stop the engine.

01:21:30.792 --> 01:21:33.830
Ellen, take the wheel.
We've got to outrun it. Ellen!

01:21:51.063 --> 01:21:54.738
- That thing gonna work?
- It'll work.

01:21:54.942 --> 01:21:58.218
If Jake says so, it will.
This charge will drive it crazy.

01:23:02.341 --> 01:23:05.413
Sweet Jesus,
we're headed straight for it!

01:23:05.597 --> 01:23:07.985
Ellen, come about!

01:23:14.146 --> 01:23:17.741
We're gonna hit it!
Hold on!

01:23:17.941 --> 01:23:19.421
Hold on!

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:22.890
Smile, you son of a bitch!

01:23:49.513 --> 01:23:50.662
- Michael!
- Come over here.

01:23:54.937 --> 01:23:56.335
Michael!

01:23:56.438 --> 01:23:59.077
It's all right! I'm OK!

01:23:59.232 --> 01:24:02.350
Anybody there? Over here!

01:24:05.822 --> 01:24:07.051
Jake!

01:24:09.743 --> 01:24:12.382
Michael, you got a minute?

01:24:12.536 --> 01:24:14.971
It's Jake!

01:24:17.961 --> 01:24:19.917
Son of a bitch!

01:24:30.931 --> 01:24:32.762
Jesus, Jake.

01:24:36.436 --> 01:24:40.112
What took you so damn long, man?

01:24:40.315 --> 01:24:42.705
What the hell are you doing alive?

01:24:42.859 --> 01:24:46.569
I told you Uncle Jake's
equipment don't crap out, eh?

01:24:49.575 --> 01:24:53.454
You're not going to do something
stupid like die on me, are you?

01:24:53.662 --> 01:24:57.177
No, man. I'm way too mean for that.

01:25:04.506 --> 01:25:07.578
So from now on,
we're going to study snails, eh?

01:25:07.759 --> 01:25:09.352
Yeah.

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:16.530
Come to Amity this summer.

01:25:16.684 --> 01:25:19.757
We'll be there.
You make sure they come.

01:25:19.938 --> 01:25:22.532
I will.
I'll miss you, Grandma.

01:25:24.401 --> 01:25:27.313
Get in, Ellen Brody.
You'll miss your plane.

01:25:27.487 --> 01:25:29.956
- Goodbye, Grandma!
- OK.

01:25:30.157 --> 01:25:32.432
- Be careful.
- OK. See ya.

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:36.016
- Take good care of Jake.
- I will.

01:25:37.623 --> 01:25:40.182
You gonna be OK?

01:25:40.335 --> 01:25:43.327
- Yeah.
- OK.

01:25:44.296 --> 01:25:47.926
When I come back,
remind me to tell you about the time

01:25:48.133 --> 01:25:50.363
I took a hundred nuns to Nairobi.

01:25:56.183 --> 01:25:59.812
There they were,
100 nuns, playing guitars

01:26:00.019 --> 01:26:03.932
and singing, "The hills are alive
with the sound of music."

01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:07.779
Then suddenly,
one comes up to me and she says,

01:26:07.986 --> 01:26:10.944
"There's smoke coming
from the engine."

01:26:11.114 --> 01:26:13.868
But I never
took them seriously,

01:26:14.034 --> 01:26:17.106
until they all started singing
"Nearer My God to Thee."
