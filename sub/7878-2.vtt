<i>"Dear Mom and Dad,</i>

00:34.464 --> 00:36.899
<i>"I realized I'm still in love</i>

00:42.572 --> 00:45.541

00:45.609 --> 00:47.476
Let's go get that
reward money, people!

00:47.544 --> 00:48.711
ALL
Yeah!

00:48.779 --> 00:49.845
All right!

00:53.884 --> 00:55.317
KLAUS
<i>Ouch!</i>

00:55.385 --> 00:57.319
<i>After a few twists and turns,</i>

00:57.387 --> 01:00.756
<i>Jeff and Hayley outsmarted Stan</i>
<i>and eloped anyways...</i>

01:00.824 --> 01:03.592
with <i>Stan's 50 K.</i>

01:03.660 --> 01:06.529
Well, you're all up to speed,
so just sit back,

01:06.596 --> 01:09.999
put down your GED paperwork
and enjoy the show, stupid.

01:13.203 --> 01:17.473
We're here to honor those who
died in the tragic bus crash,

01:17.541 --> 01:20.376
members of our community
we could never possibly forget,

01:20.443 --> 01:23.746
like Bobby the Bullet, Koko,

01:23.814 --> 01:26.015
Brett, and of course,

01:26.082 --> 01:27.750
Clown with Glasses.

01:29.753 --> 01:31.520
Clown with Glasses!

01:33.056 --> 01:34.657
You lost someone, too?

01:34.724 --> 01:36.158
My daughter.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.160
Yeah, she ran off
and got married

01:38.228 --> 01:40.563
and hasn't called us
in six weeks.

01:40.630 --> 01:43.232
At least you know
where your loved one is.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.974
Duper? I thought you died
in the bus crash.

01:52.042 --> 01:53.776
I did, but it turns out

01:53.844 --> 01:56.011
the CIA'S been working
on this new cloning thing,

01:56.079 --> 01:57.313
and here I am!

01:57.380 --> 01:59.081
You're a...
a clone?

01:59.149 --> 02:02.384
Yup, exactly the same
in every way.

02:02.452 --> 02:05.721
Except this guy was married
to some ugly bitch.

02:07.023 --> 02:08.424
Maybe it's Hayley.
Hayley?

02:08.491 --> 02:10.526
No, it's Roger.
Roger, can I call you back?

02:10.594 --> 02:12.761
You don't have to.
I'm right next to you.

02:12.829 --> 02:14.964
You didn't see me
setting all this stuff up?

02:15.031 --> 02:16.532
Now we're in
the same scene.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.100
Thanks, Don.
I'm done with this.

02:19.769 --> 02:21.637
Still broken up
about Hayley, huh?

02:21.705 --> 02:23.873
Well, don't you worry.
I'm gonna find her.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.341
And bring her
back to us?

02:25.408 --> 02:26.609
No, I'm gonna find her

02:26.676 --> 02:28.744
and steal that $50,000
she took from you.

02:28.812 --> 02:31.647
And I promise you,
I'm gonna spend it all on myself

02:31.715 --> 02:33.716
at Burt Longhorn's
Western Wear Depot.

02:33.783 --> 02:36.151
Look at me. Stan?
Stan, look at me.

02:36.219 --> 02:38.787
That's a promise.

02:40.390 --> 02:41.891
Observation deck, please.

02:47.864 --> 02:49.598
Honey, what are you
doing in here?

02:49.666 --> 02:52.234
I thought we agreed
not to go in this room.

02:52.302 --> 02:54.570
Oh, Stan, I just
miss Hayley so much.

02:54.638 --> 02:57.606
Thought I'd come in and tidy up.

02:57.674 --> 03:00.342
Throw away her expired condoms.

03:00.410 --> 03:01.677
They're unlubed.

03:01.745 --> 03:03.412
She's goodo go.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.714
Just like her mother.

03:05.782 --> 03:08.918
Ugh! We raised
a junior college dropout

03:08.985 --> 03:11.987
who stole 50 grand from us
and eloped with a stoner hippie.

03:12.055 --> 03:13.489
Face it, Slick.

03:13.556 --> 03:16.659
We've failed as parents,
even by Appalachian standards.

03:16.726 --> 03:18.360
Hi, I'm back
from school.

03:18.428 --> 03:20.462
I'm gonna watch TV
and try to forget

03:20.530 --> 03:22.898
about the wedgie
I suffered at lunch today.

03:22.966 --> 03:24.466
Aah, my butt.

03:24.534 --> 03:26.769
No TV. You've got
homework to do.

03:26.836 --> 03:28.971
Oh, Stan, he's been
in class all day.

03:29.039 --> 03:30.839
Let him relax and unwind.

03:30.907 --> 03:32.274
You're too lenient,
Francine.

03:32.342 --> 03:33.976
That's probably why
Hayley left us.

03:34.044 --> 03:35.210
Excuse me!

03:35.278 --> 03:36.712
Homework now!

03:36.780 --> 03:39.515
If Hayley left because
of anybody, it was you.

03:39.582 --> 03:42.318
You're too strict, and
you drove her away.

03:42.385 --> 03:43.752
TV! Now!

03:43.820 --> 03:46.956
Whatever. I got to get
a Popsicle on the old starfish.

03:50.193 --> 03:51.560
Listen to me.

03:51.628 --> 03:53.862
Children need structure
and discipline.

03:53.930 --> 03:55.631
No. Kids needs space

03:55.699 --> 03:58.033
to make their own mistakes
and learn from them.

03:58.101 --> 04:00.569
Well, there's only one way
to settle this.

04:00.637 --> 04:03.772
First one across the finish line
decides how we raise Steve.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.674
Deal.

Sorry we bullied you

Well, finally,

04:54.657 --> 04:57.526
I... cannot... continue.

Yes! We raise

I'm from

You're not really going after
the $50,000, are you?

05:12.375 --> 05:14.276
You have no idea
where Hayley is.

05:14.344 --> 05:15.511
Patience, fish.

05:15.578 --> 05:17.613
To find a stoned loser,

05:17.680 --> 05:19.782
I must become
a stoned loser.

05:19.849 --> 05:21.683
Watch and learn.

05:44.841 --> 05:46.675
Not sure this stuff is working.

05:46.743 --> 05:47.910
I don't feel any...

05:47.977 --> 05:50.546
Aah...!

06:08.264 --> 06:09.731
Aah!
Roger?

06:09.799 --> 06:11.967
What the hell are you
doing in Thailand?

06:12.035 --> 06:13.602
Oh, my God! It worked!

06:13.670 --> 06:15.604
Thailand, huh?

06:15.672 --> 06:18.507
I'd like three
12-year-old boys, no MSG.

06:20.243 --> 06:21.643
Stand up straight!

06:21.711 --> 06:23.412
Wipe your glasses!
Tuck in your shirt!

06:23.480 --> 06:26.682
Stan, you agreed
Steve would be raised my way!

06:26.749 --> 06:28.851
You're not allowed
to be strict with him!

06:28.918 --> 06:30.652
I'm not being
strict with Steve.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.920
Steve's out there.

06:33.156 --> 06:34.656
Wha...?

06:34.724 --> 06:37.793
You won the race, so you can
raise Steve however you like.

06:37.861 --> 06:40.496
This is a clone I
had made at the CIA

06:40.563 --> 06:42.698
for me to raise
how <i>I</i> like.

06:42.765 --> 06:44.166
I'm calling him
Steve-arino.

06:44.234 --> 06:45.601
Hi, Mom.

06:45.668 --> 06:47.169
Pretty great, huh?

06:47.237 --> 06:50.172
I also cloned world-famous
comedian John Leguizamo.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.740
'Zamo, do an
impression.

06:51.808 --> 06:54.576
Okay, uh, this is my cousin
Keisha from the block.

06:54.644 --> 06:57.379
Hey, I'm Keisha from the block.

06:57.447 --> 06:58.814
I don't know, John.

06:58.882 --> 07:00.916
I don't know anyone
like that.

07:05.470 --> 07:07.471
Stan, how could you
clone Steve?!

07:07.539 --> 07:08.773
I was in a pickle.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.242
You won the right to
raise Steve your way.

07:11.310 --> 07:12.743
But my way is
far superior.

07:12.811 --> 07:15.012
So this was your solution?!

07:15.080 --> 07:17.582
What was I supposed to do,
welch on a BMX race?

07:17.649 --> 07:18.749
Get the BMX people involved?

07:18.817 --> 07:19.884
The Counsel of 12?

07:19.952 --> 07:21.352
I'm not going before them again!

07:21.420 --> 07:23.487
Wow! I have
a clone?

07:23.555 --> 07:25.056
We should buy
matching capes

07:25.123 --> 07:26.924
and invent our own
creepy language.

07:26.992 --> 07:28.960
And do jazz-tap
routines!

07:31.096 --> 07:34.131
They're identical, right down
to their memories and emotions.

07:34.199 --> 07:36.467
So from here on,
how they turn out

07:36.535 --> 07:38.035
is totally based
on their upbringing.

07:38.103 --> 07:39.870
Cabba lakti-mo?

07:39.938 --> 07:42.073
Sheb wawa, sheb wawa!

07:44.176 --> 07:46.210
Stan, this is insane!

07:46.278 --> 07:47.511
No, it's perfect.

07:47.579 --> 07:49.146
You can raise Steve your way,

07:49.214 --> 07:50.948
and I'll raise Steve-arino
my way.

07:51.016 --> 07:52.783
We'll see
which one turns out better,

07:52.851 --> 07:54.719
and the other one
we'll just put down.

07:54.786 --> 07:55.419
What?!

07:56.588 --> 07:57.922
We'll, we'll
figure it out.

07:57.990 --> 07:59.390
Boys, come
over here.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.225
Steve-arino, I'll
be parenting you

08:01.293 --> 08:02.526
exclusively
from now on.

08:02.594 --> 08:04.195
There will be
a lot of rules,

08:04.263 --> 08:05.663
homework
and exercise.

08:05.731 --> 08:06.864
Aah!

08:06.932 --> 08:08.466
But trust me, in time,

08:08.533 --> 08:11.602
I'll mold you into a buff,
athletic model student.

08:11.670 --> 08:13.537
Every boy will want to be you,

08:13.605 --> 08:15.473
every girl will want
to be inside you.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.108
That sounds great!

08:17.175 --> 08:18.976
I'll just make a
slight adjustment

08:19.044 --> 08:20.645
so we can tell
you boys apart.

08:20.712 --> 08:22.113
What about me, Dad?

08:22.180 --> 08:23.781
Steve, your mother
will be raising you,

08:23.849 --> 08:25.082
which, unfortunately, means

08:25.150 --> 08:26.651
that your life
will suck worse

08:26.718 --> 08:28.486
than Nicolas Cage
in <i>Ghost Rider.</i>

08:28.553 --> 08:30.521
All right, that's it!

08:30.589 --> 08:32.490
If you think
you're so much better

08:32.557 --> 08:35.592
at parenting than me,
we'll do your stupid plan.

08:35.660 --> 08:37.495
May the best Steve win!

08:37.562 --> 08:40.664
Wait. So I don't have to
follow any of Dad's rules?

08:40.732 --> 08:42.533
That's right,
honey.
Yeah!

08:42.601 --> 08:44.335
I'm gonna go have
a garden burger!

08:44.403 --> 08:46.671
Maybe it'll turn me gay,
maybe it won't.

08:46.738 --> 08:49.874
I guess
we'll just let fate decide.

08:53.011 --> 08:54.645
Beer for the newlyweds.

08:54.713 --> 08:56.080
Let's cut
to the chase.

08:56.148 --> 08:58.916
I'm here to steal
your 50 grand.
What?

08:58.984 --> 09:01.118
Hand it over,
or I will set in motion

09:01.186 --> 09:03.721
the most brilliant, elegant plan
I've ever come up with.

09:03.789 --> 09:06.057
No! It's our money, and
we're making it last.

09:06.124 --> 09:08.659
Yeah, we're gonna use it
to start our new life,

09:08.727 --> 09:11.462
selling both realistic
and unrealistic wolf masks.

09:12.831 --> 09:13.931
Very well, then.

09:13.999 --> 09:15.399
The plan it is.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.635
Myeeeah!

09:18.804 --> 09:21.272
Myeeeah!

09:21.340 --> 09:22.807
This is your
elegant plan?

09:22.874 --> 09:25.009
You think I'm gonna
give you the money

09:25.077 --> 09:27.011
to get you to stop
making that noise?

09:27.079 --> 09:29.513
Myeeeah!

09:29.581 --> 09:30.815
Yes.
I'm Myeeeah.

09:30.882 --> 09:33.017
Did you want
to try paragliding?

09:35.821 --> 09:39.123
Ugh! I stayed up until 3:00
playing <i>Night Manager,</i>

09:39.191 --> 09:41.992
the most realistic retail-themed
video game on the market.

09:42.060 --> 09:43.794
Hmm. Sounds
productive.

09:43.862 --> 09:46.163
We went hiking
at dawn this morning.

09:46.231 --> 09:47.998
There we are--
egg whites and soy toast

09:48.066 --> 09:49.700
for my little
achiever.

09:49.768 --> 09:51.502
What do I get
for breakfast?

09:51.570 --> 09:53.204
Anything you
want, honey.

09:53.271 --> 09:54.739
Uh, okay.

09:54.806 --> 09:57.108
How about chocolate chip
pancakes?

09:57.175 --> 09:59.377
And... wine?

09:59.444 --> 10:01.612
Chocolate chip
pancakes and chardonnay.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.215
The Delta Burke
breakfast it is.

10:05.450 --> 10:06.784
Put this on,
Steve-arino.

10:06.852 --> 10:09.653
You start your first day
of military school in an hour.

10:09.721 --> 10:11.155
Military school?!

10:11.223 --> 10:12.723
You want those dividends,
don't you?

10:12.791 --> 10:13.891
The muscles?
The brains?

10:13.959 --> 10:15.426
Then you have
to trust me.

10:15.494 --> 10:16.594
I trust you, Dad.

10:16.661 --> 10:17.862
Attaboy.

10:22.768 --> 10:24.702
I think I'll take up swearing.

10:27.672 --> 10:31.342

We won the big game

11:30.402 --> 11:31.702

11:31.770 --> 11:33.270

young man.

I haven't been off this couch

Well, where's
Steve-arino?

left a note.

"P.S., I will be dropping
the "arino" from my name,

Ha! You drove
him off.

14:19.504 --> 14:21.505
Just like you
drove Hayley off.

14:21.573 --> 14:22.773
I'm the
better parent!

14:22.841 --> 14:25.275
Oh, my God, it's true.

14:25.343 --> 14:27.578
I've failed as a father.

14:27.646 --> 14:29.947
You can still
be a good dad...

more nachos, fat ass.

14:36.988 --> 14:39.156

feet off the table.

- Mom says I don't have to.
- Well, I say...

14:54.278 --> 14:56.279
Mom, Dad's trying
to get me to run away

14:56.347 --> 14:57.447
like all your other kids!

14:57.515 --> 14:58.682
Stan, leave him alone.

14:58.749 --> 15:00.317
Steve, I got your lunch.

15:00.384 --> 15:02.786
That is, if you want
to go to school today.

15:02.853 --> 15:04.254
I'll put it
in your knapsack.

15:04.322 --> 15:05.455
Don't touch that!

Hi, Dad.

15:25.543 --> 15:27.077
What...? Why are you
dressed as Steve?

15:27.144 --> 15:28.445
It's simple really.

15:28.512 --> 15:29.946
I hated all your rules

15:30.014 --> 15:31.548
and wanted Steve's easy life.

15:31.615 --> 15:33.717
So, I faked running away
and took his place.

15:33.784 --> 15:35.952
Check this out.
Getting fancy!

15:37.888 --> 15:39.489
Great, Stan.

15:39.557 --> 15:42.993
You turned your Steve
into a cat-killing psychopath.

where my Steve...

I swear, every time I help
someone strengthen their core,

16:08.686 --> 16:10.186
it comes back
to haunt me.

We have to follow him
to Steve.

How? He's going
through the woods.

around, Dad.

18:41.739 --> 18:43.973
All the running, all the...
all the studying,

18:44.041 --> 18:46.376

Really. You name it.

I want to kill Steve.

19:18.709 --> 19:19.676
Okay.
Stan!

19:19.743 --> 19:20.810
Right, right, right.

out of that cage,

I will push you back up my
clownhole and birth you again

20:05.889 --> 20:07.190
and name you my bitch.

20:07.258 --> 20:08.791
Now get out
of that cage!

20:11.362 --> 20:14.897
I guess Steve needs both
of our parenting styles

20:14.965 --> 20:16.366
to balance him out.

20:16.433 --> 20:17.700
You're right.
And you know what?
