<i>Roger. Standing by to copy. Over.</i>

<i>Solid copy on relief in place. Over.</i>

00:25.239 --> 00:27.068
What you got, playboy, what you got?

00:27.188 --> 00:29.196
All right, do "platoon," bro.

00:29.316 --> 00:31.570
Hey, white boys, what you waiting for?

00:31.690 --> 00:33.747
That hole ain't gonna dig itself.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.017
Put your dick skin into it. Dig!

00:37.850 --> 00:40.339
- What color are you?
- Shit, what you know about that?

00:40.459 --> 00:42.687
- That was pretty good.
- Gimme something that hurts.

00:42.807 --> 00:45.367
- What about <i>Big Lebowski</i> ?
- <i>Big Lebowski.</i>

00:45.487 --> 00:46.498
All right.

00:46.618 --> 00:49.059
"Darker than a black steer's tookus..."

00:49.179 --> 00:51.862
Hey, Brad, working those deltoids,
that's good.

00:51.982 --> 00:55.265
Shit, too easy.
Give me something real, man.

00:55.426 --> 00:57.613
- Do <i>The Rock.</i>
- How about <i>The Rock</i> ?

00:57.733 --> 00:59.583
Brother, you need a friend?

00:59.926 --> 01:01.102
"Your best?

01:01.341 --> 01:03.566
"Losers only complain about their best.

01:04.608 --> 01:07.158
"Winners go home
and fuck the prom queen.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.737
"She was the prom queen."

01:10.484 --> 01:11.802
It's jacked, dawg.

01:11.922 --> 01:14.239
We got the Iceman
seriously tweaking out on us.

01:14.359 --> 01:16.426
The best fucking team leader
in the battalion.

01:16.546 --> 01:17.596
No offense.

01:18.803 --> 01:19.958
And we're losing him

01:20.118 --> 01:21.601
because some white boy

01:21.721 --> 01:24.721
accidentally on purpose
tries to waste a haji.

01:26.417 --> 01:28.967
Back in Nasiriyah,
we seen Generals drop mad arty rounds

01:29.087 --> 01:32.094
on an unarmed civilian city.
Must've killed thousands.

01:32.921 --> 01:35.737
And what about all those
little smoking burnt up little haji kids

01:35.857 --> 01:38.309
on the M.S.Rs all hit by legit calledin

01:38.470 --> 01:40.437
officerapproved air strikes?

01:41.063 --> 01:44.656
Shit, we had a battalion of doctors
try to light our asses up.

01:45.545 --> 01:46.795
So fucking what?

01:47.439 --> 01:48.402
It's war, dawg.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.278
Back in Afghanistan,

01:53.316 --> 01:55.251
I thought y'all were the shit.

01:55.371 --> 01:57.121
Blowing up Taliban forts,

01:57.441 --> 01:59.217
taking out air batteries.

02:01.057 --> 02:04.126
All I heard about was his reputation
back in Afghanistan.

02:04.246 --> 02:07.171
I finally get on his team,
he goes all weak titty on me.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.310
I'm going to take a shit.

02:09.559 --> 02:11.813
How about Stallone, dude?
He's the star of the movie.

02:11.933 --> 02:14.625
I brought some water if you want me
to fill up your camelbaks.

02:14.745 --> 02:16.680
Figure I'd save you a trip over to H&S.

02:18.435 --> 02:21.385
Hey, Garza, hand me
that L.S.A. up there, will ya?

02:22.672 --> 02:24.438
Yeah, no thanks, James.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.404
Fucknuts thinks he can buy his way out

02:31.564 --> 02:34.127
of shooting those kid
by getting us a drink of water.

02:34.247 --> 02:36.897
I tell ya, jacks,
it's this new generation.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.434
In the opinion of this Marine,
it's all that damn gangster rap

02:40.554 --> 02:44.372
and those video games that are
desensitizing today's youth to violence.

02:45.571 --> 02:46.377
Yeah.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.208
Hey, did you hear that?
We're doing comm checks.

02:53.328 --> 02:54.676
I'll tell you what is fucked.

02:55.018 --> 02:58.250
Because of that Dylan Klebold wannabe,
we got an inquiry on the whole platoon.

02:58.370 --> 03:01.643
Ours ain't the only platoon
that ain't shooting straight.

03:01.803 --> 03:03.978
You all got your hands full
with Captain America.

03:04.138 --> 03:05.756
Every time he hits a pebble, he thinks

03:05.876 --> 03:08.399
- the whole company's being ambushed.
- Don't I know it.

03:08.683 --> 03:10.529
Captain America's gone, dawg.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.040
You see that look in his eyes?

03:12.160 --> 03:14.906
Like he's afraid if he takes a shit,
haji's gonna crawl out of his ass.

03:15.249 --> 03:18.168
We got the best platoon commander
and the whole fucking battalion's

03:18.288 --> 03:21.703
on his ass because he did the right
thing and stood up to Encino man.

03:22.372 --> 03:24.440
It ain't the hajis gonna kill us, man.

03:24.560 --> 03:25.874
It's fucking command.

03:27.558 --> 03:30.671
Maybe Brad's got the right idea,
hiding underneath his Humvee.

Casey Kasem two closing on your six.

03:53.559 --> 03:54.863
- Shit.
- Devil Dogs.

03:55.023 --> 03:56.864
- Sir.
- How's the sitrep here?

03:57.808 --> 03:58.758
Good, sir.

04:01.619 --> 04:04.064
Been through a lot these past few days.

04:04.184 --> 04:06.731
I know there's a lot of strong feelings.

04:07.683 --> 04:10.650
I want you to think of me as the kind
of commander who's not only tough

04:10.770 --> 04:13.043
and aggressive, but who also cares.

04:13.997 --> 04:16.747
I want to hear exactly
what your concerns are.

04:17.684 --> 04:19.595
What I mean is that I want you
to talk freely.

04:20.122 --> 04:21.971
Forget my bars for a moment.

04:24.436 --> 04:25.685
Corporal Holsey?

04:25.945 --> 04:27.383
Is there anything on your mind?

04:27.503 --> 04:29.655
Sir, is it true
that we lost our battalion colors

04:29.775 --> 04:32.646
in the supply truck
that Godfather ordered abandoned?

04:34.654 --> 04:36.558
Hard as it is for me to say,

04:37.142 --> 04:38.563
the 1st reconnaissance colors

04:38.683 --> 04:41.333
proudly carried into battle
since Vietnam...

04:41.803 --> 04:42.910
Are reported missing.

04:43.727 --> 04:46.198
I can tell you the loss of these colors

04:46.370 --> 04:49.458
is something that weighs heavily
on Godfather's shoulders.

04:51.306 --> 04:52.247
Baptist,

04:52.557 --> 04:54.533
- how are you doing?
- <i>Capitao.</i>

04:57.852 --> 04:59.905
It don't work so good, you know?

05:03.909 --> 05:05.259
<i>Estupido</i>, you know?

05:06.159 --> 05:07.109
<i>Jes</i>, sir.

05:07.306 --> 05:08.396
<i>Esactly</i> so.

05:08.595 --> 05:09.603
<i>Entende, si?</i>

05:09.784 --> 05:10.584
Yes.

05:11.025 --> 05:13.106
Yes, it is. Thank you, Baptist.

05:13.283 --> 05:14.083
<i>Naw.</i>

05:15.176 --> 05:15.985
Doc,

05:16.257 --> 05:19.007
- how about you?
- I'm all squared away, sir.

05:20.532 --> 05:21.574
Doc, look,

05:21.862 --> 05:24.825
we're all aware how much the men
look up to you.

05:25.596 --> 05:29.346
- I'd like to know what you're thinking.
- I don't think so, sir.

05:29.534 --> 05:33.148
This is your chance to get
a little something off your chest.

05:35.473 --> 05:38.248
- Are you asking me to speak frankly?
- Yes.

05:38.511 --> 05:39.382
Well...

05:42.291 --> 05:44.763
Well, sir, it's just
that you're incompetent, sir.

05:53.495 --> 05:55.023
I'm doing the best I can.

05:55.409 --> 05:57.159
Sir, it's not good enough.

06:11.658 --> 06:13.108
<i>Bom, doc Bryan, bom.</i>

06:13.658 --> 06:14.508
<i>Muy bom.</i>

06:16.783 --> 06:18.433
Lose the fucking colors.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.162
We'll figure it out.
I gotta get on the radio.

06:21.282 --> 06:24.664
The radios aren't holding the proper
G.P.S. time for more than 12 hours.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.434
The time keeps drifting.

06:26.769 --> 06:28.788
The 1st lesson
that they taught us back in college

06:28.908 --> 06:31.110
when I was working security
for Duran Duran

06:31.230 --> 06:34.289
- and U2 was the primacy of comms.
- Captain.

06:34.409 --> 06:35.209
Eric!

06:35.658 --> 06:38.931
The men and I here
were attempting to unfuck the comms.

06:39.159 --> 06:43.113
How battalion expects us to fight a war
with this recycled junk is beyond me.

06:43.274 --> 06:44.546
Very good, sir.

06:45.097 --> 06:46.947
- A word with you?
- Sure.

06:47.339 --> 06:48.659
Privately, sir.

06:49.106 --> 06:49.953
Excellent.

06:56.473 --> 06:58.865
- Eric, what can I do for you?
- Sir, it's about the enemy A.Ks

06:58.985 --> 07:01.599
you've been firing from your vehicle.
You're endangering us.

07:01.719 --> 07:05.185
You're not calling your targets,
the A.Ks sound like enemy fire.

07:05.305 --> 07:07.430
- Jesus Christ, Eric.
- Respectfully, sir,

07:07.886 --> 07:09.886
you fire an A.K. one more time,

07:10.006 --> 07:11.392
I'll fuck you up.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.308
Gentlemen,

07:15.890 --> 07:18.273
- everything squared away?
- Yes, sir.

07:18.792 --> 07:21.288
The Captain was helping us
unfuck our comms.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.486
Thank you, sir.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.490
... and it's based
on Godfather's experience

07:25.650 --> 07:28.608
that this breeds
like a fucking yeast infection.

07:29.595 --> 07:31.745
Every time an order is questioned,

07:32.705 --> 07:36.416
every time dissention
is allowed to state its case,

07:37.345 --> 07:40.923
there's a corresponding decrease
in overall morale.

07:43.407 --> 07:46.134
I can't have people questioning

07:46.295 --> 07:48.460
the orders of a superior officer.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.602
And if you have a performance complaint
regarding subordinates,

07:56.097 --> 07:58.747
that has to go
through the proper channels.

08:00.221 --> 08:03.171
Backchannel grumbling is unacceptable,
gentlemen.

08:03.563 --> 08:04.713
Unacceptable!

08:08.137 --> 08:09.543
Now I know

08:09.663 --> 08:11.285
some people aren't happy

08:11.445 --> 08:14.195
about the pellmell assault
on that airfield.

08:15.033 --> 08:17.483
And I admit it was rash,
even reckless.

08:19.024 --> 08:20.214
But General Mattis

08:20.334 --> 08:23.168
had to have our eyes on that airfield.

08:24.510 --> 08:27.546
And your recon teams failed
in the time allotted.

08:29.970 --> 08:31.888
This war isn't going well for us.

08:32.374 --> 08:34.975
Resistance in the cities
is greater than expected.

08:36.158 --> 08:39.607
And the General feels
we're killing far too many civilians.

08:42.537 --> 08:46.225
Godfather thinks we're going
to go back into these cities we bypassed

08:46.345 --> 08:48.095
and root out the bad guys.

08:50.220 --> 08:52.870
The iraqis are on the fence
about this war.

08:53.659 --> 08:57.009
They're only going to bet
on the horse they think can win.

08:57.159 --> 08:57.959
Sir?

08:58.282 --> 09:00.132
Any expectation of resupply?

09:03.283 --> 09:04.083
Zero.

09:07.533 --> 09:08.944
Unbeknownst to me,

09:10.644 --> 09:13.820
when I gave the order
to abandon that supply truck...

09:14.784 --> 09:16.834
our battalion colors were on it.

09:18.094 --> 09:19.093
Gentlemen,

09:19.889 --> 09:21.788
the loss of those colors...

09:25.039 --> 09:27.137
It's one
of the most regrettable incidents

09:27.257 --> 09:28.914
of my entire career.

09:29.034 --> 09:31.889
And Ferrando
takes full responsibility for it.

09:33.594 --> 09:34.952
But you should be aware

09:35.295 --> 09:37.332
that the loss of those colors

09:38.622 --> 09:40.354
will be more than offset

09:41.178 --> 09:44.545
by the battle streamers
we will earn in this war.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.380
And we will earn 'em.

09:49.469 --> 09:50.519
That I know.

10:05.858 --> 10:08.787
The three wise men,
you must have traveled far.

10:08.907 --> 10:12.557
Our platoon commander's on watch
how fucking righteous is that?

10:13.219 --> 10:14.788
I see the 3 of you coming together,

10:14.908 --> 10:16.912
I get to thinking there's
some kind of problem.

10:17.032 --> 10:18.849
No, Gunny, nothing like that.

10:18.969 --> 10:22.255
We're just concerned about this thing
with the Lt. and the Captain.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.523
Word is he and Casey Kasem
are going after the Lt.

10:24.643 --> 10:26.462
for taking him the radio
when he called in

10:26.622 --> 10:29.185
dangerclose artillery
on a bullshit target.

10:29.489 --> 10:32.954
And, well, sir, we just want to say
that if it comes to the C.O.

10:33.074 --> 10:35.038
charging you with insubordination...

10:35.158 --> 10:37.291
Shut the fuck up
and do your fucking jobs.

10:37.411 --> 10:41.268
What happens between Cpt Schwetje and me
is none of your fucking business.

10:52.469 --> 10:53.288
We were...

10:53.408 --> 10:55.589
Lt. doesn't want this thing
to mess with the platoon.

10:55.709 --> 10:59.472
And he sure as hell doesn't want
anybody taking sides for or against.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.282
Now back the fuck down.

11:02.157 --> 11:03.666
The shit's on the Lieutenant

11:03.826 --> 11:06.002
and he wants it to stay that way.

11:28.237 --> 11:32.087
<i>Hitman, this is Hitman Three Two.
I got your loud and clear. Copy.</i>

11:32.535 --> 11:36.485
What the fuck are you two retards doing?
Get up on that fucking gun.

11:37.008 --> 11:39.264
What the fuck is Captain America
doing out there?

11:39.384 --> 11:40.634
Digging a hole.

11:41.418 --> 11:43.872
What the fuck's
he digging out there for?

11:44.864 --> 11:46.649
I have no idea, Corporal.

11:49.701 --> 11:50.701
Dirty,

11:51.123 --> 11:52.778
explain this shit to me.

11:53.801 --> 11:55.210
It's a combat jack.

11:55.779 --> 11:59.155
Captain feels the need
to entrench in a solitary position

11:59.401 --> 12:01.080
before letting one fly.

12:15.761 --> 12:17.011
I wasn't gonna.

12:17.512 --> 12:18.862
Fuck that, dirty.

12:30.889 --> 12:32.715
Seven, eight...

12:38.895 --> 12:40.201
They're moving.

12:40.832 --> 12:42.765
At least I think they're moving.

12:43.885 --> 12:46.893
- John, are they moving?
- Shut up. You're fucking me up.

12:47.078 --> 12:49.028
They're too far away to lase.

12:49.293 --> 12:50.606
What do you think?

12:50.726 --> 12:52.576
We watch them for 10 mikes,
we're gonna know.

12:52.696 --> 12:54.471
There's 140, give or take.

12:56.389 --> 12:57.639
Get me a radio.

12:59.281 --> 13:00.767
You gonna call Captain Patterson?

13:00.887 --> 13:03.076
I'm gonna get on the net
with the F.A.C. first.

13:03.531 --> 13:06.389
Godfather F.A.C.,
this is Assassin Two Actual.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.500
<i>Assassin Two, this is twisting,
Godfather F.A.C. Send it.</i>

13:10.662 --> 13:12.280
This is Assassin Two Actual.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.136
We have possible enemy contact.

13:14.256 --> 13:17.347
We have 140 possible armor on the move

13:17.467 --> 13:19.474
15 kliks due east of our position.

13:19.986 --> 13:21.712
Grids to follow. Over.

13:22.793 --> 13:25.584
<i>Assassin Two,
this is twisting, Godfather F.A.C.</i>

13:25.704 --> 13:27.771
<i>Standing by to copy grid. Over.</i>

13:28.514 --> 13:30.264
This shit is fucked, bro.

13:36.388 --> 13:37.388
Sergeant,

13:37.763 --> 13:40.830
you know what I can do when sand gets up
inside one of these video cameras?

13:40.950 --> 13:42.397
Get with your team.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.243
We got armor coming at us.

13:54.431 --> 13:55.640
Where's Brad?

13:55.760 --> 13:58.643
Jesus fucking Christ, Walt.
Are you serious? My first combat jack.

13:58.763 --> 14:00.758
Fuck your jack.
We're being overrun by armor.

14:00.919 --> 14:02.296
He's in his grave.

14:03.705 --> 14:05.017
Brad, Brad.

14:05.463 --> 14:07.882
Alpha counted 140 T72s headed our way.

14:08.457 --> 14:10.439
- Tanks!
- Say what?

14:10.559 --> 14:13.271
Hurry up, grab your gear.
Let's fucking go!

14:14.668 --> 14:16.098
Get on the hook with Godfather.

14:16.218 --> 14:19.221
Find out if they have any more S.A.
on the tanks.

14:23.413 --> 14:24.329
Brad,

14:24.728 --> 14:26.334
battalion's going Redcon One

14:26.454 --> 14:28.504
and Alpha called in air support.

14:31.047 --> 14:32.139
Hey, Garza!

14:33.709 --> 14:35.794
How much more ammo do you need?

14:36.186 --> 14:38.900
I don't know.
How much armor we got coming?

14:39.435 --> 14:40.949
I don't know, brah.

14:41.806 --> 14:43.084
- Hey, fella
- Ray,

14:43.204 --> 14:45.412
get on T.A.D. six and T.A.D. seven.

14:45.957 --> 14:48.787
Walt, get up on the berm
and man the Mark-19.

14:50.704 --> 14:52.094
You have the thermals?

14:52.214 --> 14:55.730
- Yeah, I got them right here, dawg.
- Warm them the fuck up and use them.

14:59.358 --> 15:02.297
Why the fuck are you two standing around
with your dicks in your hands?

15:02.417 --> 15:04.740
- Don't you have teams to take care of?
- Roger that.

15:05.508 --> 15:06.701
Tanks coming!

15:08.980 --> 15:10.130
Iceman's back.

15:10.447 --> 15:11.871
Find the reporter, Trombley.

15:12.772 --> 15:15.282
If little Miss Rolling Stone
gets run over by an Iraqi tank,

15:15.402 --> 15:18.479
- Ray's band won't make the cover.
- Yes, Sergeant.

15:22.582 --> 15:24.384
They're moving. You can see it.

15:26.597 --> 15:29.133
You want us to tear down the cammie net?

15:30.943 --> 15:32.600
So we're unsupplied,

15:32.892 --> 15:35.525
24 hours ahead of the next
nearest Marine,

15:35.645 --> 15:37.564
and now the Iraqi army has found us.

15:38.457 --> 15:39.838
I like the plan, Brad.

15:39.958 --> 15:42.135
- It works for me.
- It's a town...

15:42.502 --> 15:45.331
- Jacks, you see anything?
- I don't see shit.

15:45.848 --> 15:47.323
... and it ain't moving.

15:52.287 --> 15:53.508
Are you sure?

15:55.454 --> 15:56.804
It's autokinesis.

15:58.204 --> 16:01.671
You're seeing the involuntary
muscle movements of your own eyes.

16:04.144 --> 16:07.594
Those lights aren't going
to come any closer than they are.

16:09.650 --> 16:11.158
It's a fucking town.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.878
30, 40 kliks out there at least.

16:17.238 --> 16:19.091
How far out did Alpha call this?

16:19.211 --> 16:20.256
15 kliks.

16:33.224 --> 16:35.373
It's bullshit. There's no armor.

16:37.722 --> 16:39.055
There's no armor?

16:45.420 --> 16:49.647
Apparently the United States Air Force
thinks Brad Colbert is full of shit.

16:56.097 --> 16:57.534
Jesus Christ, dude.

16:58.082 --> 17:00.563
That's one hell of an air strike
you had the Lt. call in.

17:00.725 --> 17:03.292
- It's not on me.
- 11,000 lbs of bombs.

17:03.412 --> 17:05.032
That's some serious shock and awe.

17:05.153 --> 17:06.945
<i>Still awaiting your B.D.A. Do you copy?</i>

17:07.066 --> 17:08.965
Assassin Two, yeah, we copy.

17:10.336 --> 17:11.715
The Lt. is really freaking.

17:11.836 --> 17:13.617
He needs us to find something we hit.

17:13.737 --> 17:15.744
How many tanks was that, John, 140?

17:16.836 --> 17:18.337
I told you, motherfucker.

17:18.457 --> 17:20.409
It was the Lt. that called it.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.097
Check it out, y'all.

17:24.463 --> 17:26.813
That's all that's left of a haji tank.

17:27.219 --> 17:29.325
You'll get the navy comm for this one.

17:29.587 --> 17:32.037
- We could have been overrun.
- Fuck you.

17:32.337 --> 17:34.528
Damon, don't be a pussy.
Fucking call it in.

17:34.648 --> 17:35.904
Let's give the Lt. a tank.

17:36.024 --> 17:39.152
He can get his medal.
We can get the fuck out of here.

17:39.272 --> 17:41.622
Assassin Two, this is Two Three. Over.

17:41.742 --> 17:44.354
We've covered three grid squares,
we have nothing.

17:44.474 --> 17:46.928
I say again, nothing. How copy?

17:47.327 --> 17:50.128
I'm keeping this.
Get some ESPN and X-Games.

17:50.858 --> 17:53.991
There should be a trail up there.
They're extracting us.

17:57.085 --> 18:00.897
If there'd've been tanks here,
that would have been fucking cool.

18:01.629 --> 18:03.751
<i>Assassin, this is Assassin Two Actual.</i>

18:04.087 --> 18:07.086
<i>- Stand by for sitrep. Over.
- Assassin Actual standing by.</i>

18:07.206 --> 18:11.468
<i>We're pushing three kliks north
to Papa Victor 217598</i>

18:11.628 --> 18:14.066
<i>the nearest hamlet to question
the locals on the armor. Over.</i>

18:14.186 --> 18:15.090
<i>Solid copy.</i>

18:15.210 --> 18:17.660
Corporal, stop over here by the village.

18:17.839 --> 18:21.189
These people are close enough
to have sighted the armor.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.488
Hey, push off dismounts.

18:27.276 --> 18:30.403
<i>All Victors, all Victors, dismount and
hold north of the town. Breaker break.</i>

18:31.319 --> 18:33.715
<i>- Assassin Two One...</i>
- Cover the Lt.

18:42.361 --> 18:43.262
Dude,

18:43.382 --> 18:45.566
what do you think they're saying?

18:47.151 --> 18:48.501
"Excuse me, meesh.

18:49.143 --> 18:51.095
"Tell the man that
we come in friendship."

18:51.215 --> 18:52.666
And meesh is, "Dude,

18:52.901 --> 18:55.341
"my big American friends
are going to fuck you up

18:55.461 --> 18:57.469
"if you don't show us
some blownup tanks."

18:57.589 --> 19:00.208
And the haji's all, "Habadabada?
Daba daba."

19:00.470 --> 19:02.018
And meesh is all, "Dude,

19:02.180 --> 19:04.291
"these Iraqis love the fact
that we are here.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.216
"They fucking love freedom
and they thought

19:06.336 --> 19:09.092
"that those fireballs last night
were fucking wicked, dude.

19:09.212 --> 19:11.762
"You Americans have killed
a lot of sand.

19:11.971 --> 19:13.747
"The sand was very evil."

19:14.275 --> 19:15.832
The Lieutenant's all,

19:16.086 --> 19:18.243
"Meesh, I just shit my panties.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.406
"Tell the nice man if he doesn't show me
at least one blownup tank,

19:22.773 --> 19:25.625
"I'll look very stupid and
the other officers will laugh at me."

19:25.900 --> 19:29.417
And Meesh is all,
"Dude, throw me a friggin' bone here.

19:29.748 --> 19:32.507
"How about a frigging pickup truck
with bald tires?"

19:32.794 --> 19:35.460
Bro, and the haji's all,
"Habdaba? Dabity daba."

19:35.580 --> 19:37.006
And meesh is, "Lieutenant,

19:37.126 --> 19:39.931
"this haji dude is totally bummed
he can't save your career.

19:40.093 --> 19:42.391
"He's got no tanks, but check it out,

19:42.511 --> 19:44.909
"you can have his bitchin' daughter."

19:45.029 --> 19:47.314
And the Lieutenant's all weepy and shit.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.303
Fucking frathouse pussy.

19:50.937 --> 19:52.023
Back to camp.

19:52.143 --> 19:53.865
I'll ride with Team Two.

19:59.486 --> 20:01.180
What'd the old man say?

20:01.902 --> 20:02.902
He's afraid

20:03.340 --> 20:05.790
we're going to bomb his village tonight.

20:07.702 --> 20:09.228
Lt. turned it down.

20:10.086 --> 20:11.504
I am really hungry.

20:12.187 --> 20:14.910
- Mount up.
- Stand by for short count. Five...

20:15.030 --> 20:17.880
You take the fur off
before you eat it, right?

20:21.322 --> 20:24.153
<i>Assassin, this is Assassin Two Actual.
Over.</i>

20:24.466 --> 20:26.260
<i>This is Assassin Actual. Send it.</i>

20:26.834 --> 20:30.723
<i>We have found some indication
of Iraqi armor operating in the area,</i>

20:30.843 --> 20:34.001
<i>but evidence on which to base a B.D.A.</i>

20:34.121 --> 20:37.030
<i>is inconclusive so far. Over.</i>

20:37.336 --> 20:39.740
Interrogative: by inconclusive,
do you mean to say

20:39.860 --> 20:42.522
that you have found
no destroyed Iraqi armor?

20:42.642 --> 20:44.472
<i>This is Assassin Two Actual.</i>

20:44.592 --> 20:47.040
<i>At this time, not specifally. Over.</i>

20:48.036 --> 20:51.986
Interrogative: have you found any
non specific destroyed Iraqi armor?

20:52.167 --> 20:53.417
<i>Negative. Over.</i>

20:53.790 --> 20:57.578
Assassin Two, have you found any
destroyed targets, military or civilian?

20:58.167 --> 20:59.117
<i>Negative.</i>

20:59.603 --> 21:01.246
<i>We turned a lot of dirt. Over.</i>

21:01.366 --> 21:02.416
Roger that.

21:02.584 --> 21:04.234
<i>Assassin Two Actual out.</i>

21:06.976 --> 21:09.771
11,000 lbs of ordinance dropped
and we didn't hit any armor.

21:10.604 --> 21:13.348
We didn't destroy
any villages though either.

21:13.468 --> 21:16.110
Guess that sort of goes
in the win column, right?

21:17.490 --> 21:19.140
Fill the ranger graves!

21:19.291 --> 21:20.941
Sterilize your position.

21:21.176 --> 21:23.908
We expect to be Oscar Mike by 1500.

21:36.121 --> 21:36.967
Oh no.

21:38.466 --> 21:40.051
Christlover at my nine.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.805
- Coming this way?
- Yeah. E.T.A. is like 10 seconds.

21:43.965 --> 21:45.474
You gotta deal with this too.

21:48.216 --> 21:49.018
Men.

21:51.706 --> 21:53.256
I'm holding a service

21:53.553 --> 21:56.118
and I wonder if you would take comfort
in pausing for a word of prayer.

21:56.238 --> 21:57.778
No thank you, Lieutenant Commander.

21:58.031 --> 22:00.599
We got the warning order, so it looks
like we're going to be moving out

22:00.719 --> 22:03.219
to kill a whole bunch more of
these godless heathens for you.

22:03.339 --> 22:05.911
Yeah, but don't worry. We will not rest

22:06.071 --> 22:08.246
until the Iraqi threat
to your way of worship

22:08.406 --> 22:10.958
- has been completely neutralized.
- I'm aware of the warning order.

22:11.118 --> 22:13.835
It is for that reason that
we are congregating for a brief...

22:13.995 --> 22:15.127
Oh, the other thing...

22:15.247 --> 22:16.567
The other thing is...

22:16.687 --> 22:19.437
is that my team leader here,
Sergeant Colbert.

22:19.602 --> 22:22.678
Yeah, he was born a hebrew
and remains a practicing christkiller.

22:23.563 --> 22:26.640
So, it's purely out of respect for him,
I feel as if

22:26.800 --> 22:29.750
I'm going to have to forgo
your festive rituals.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.385
Got more boxes?

22:35.559 --> 22:36.940
Who's got the MREs?

22:42.131 --> 22:42.944
Men!

22:45.231 --> 22:47.226
- I'm holding a brief service.
- No thanks, sir.

22:47.346 --> 22:49.596
We're gearing up here at the moment.

22:49.743 --> 22:50.693
Sergeant?

22:51.249 --> 22:52.499
What's up, dawg?

22:55.104 --> 22:55.854
Can I?

22:58.540 --> 22:59.490
Go ahead.

22:59.828 --> 23:01.178
Thank you, Sarge.

23:05.310 --> 23:06.596
There's one in every crowd.

23:08.157 --> 23:10.898
I don't know why you guys
are down on this shit.

23:11.018 --> 23:12.268
I'm a christian.

23:12.783 --> 23:14.696
Theologically speaking, Trombley,

23:14.816 --> 23:16.258
the world's been going downhill

23:16.378 --> 23:18.983
ever since man first offered
entrails to the gods.

23:19.103 --> 23:22.192
- What's that mean, entrails?
- That religion is gay.

23:22.312 --> 23:23.613
The point, Lance Corporal,

23:23.773 --> 23:26.911
we're supposed to be
a recon unit of pure warrior spirit.

23:27.806 --> 23:30.435
We're out here,
40 kliks into enemy lines,

23:31.022 --> 23:32.722
and this man of God here,

23:34.139 --> 23:35.589
he's a fucking pog.

23:36.293 --> 23:38.060
In fact, he's an officer pog.

23:39.729 --> 23:42.624
That's one more layer of bureaucracy
and unnecessary logistics.

23:42.794 --> 23:46.751
One more asshole we need to supply
MREs and baby wipes for.

23:47.799 --> 23:49.249
And worst of all...

23:49.495 --> 23:50.549
It should be tight.

23:50.669 --> 23:53.935
Worst of all, the motherfucker
doesn't even carry a weapon.

23:54.718 --> 23:57.173
When push comes to shove,
even rolling stone picks up a gun.

23:57.293 --> 23:59.802
But this fucking shill of God,

24:01.736 --> 24:03.386
he can't cover a sector.

24:04.211 --> 24:06.238
He'll never hump ammo or claymores.

24:09.761 --> 24:11.251
This is a fucking war.

24:12.528 --> 24:14.709
And we're here as warriors.

24:16.345 --> 24:18.531
So on top of everything else
that's expected of us,

24:18.651 --> 24:21.701
do we need to drag him along
and indulge in this...

24:22.295 --> 24:23.799
makebelieve bullshit?

24:23.959 --> 24:24.773
Oh no.

24:25.553 --> 24:27.940
Not only do we have to worry
about all the Charms you've eaten,

24:28.060 --> 24:30.110
now Brad's just pissed off God.

24:30.236 --> 24:33.573
No, seriously, doc, have you ever
analyzed a wet dream?

24:34.062 --> 24:35.735
I mean, the mind is so powerful,

24:35.855 --> 24:38.814
it can give you a dream so real
that it makes your dick come.

24:39.419 --> 24:41.475
Why can't you harness that power
when you're awake?

24:41.595 --> 24:45.213
Why can't you meditate yourself into
thinking you're fucking a chick so hot

24:45.333 --> 24:46.730
that you actually orgasm?

24:46.850 --> 24:50.800
Wait, are you talking about like
jerking off without using any hands?

24:51.002 --> 24:54.557
No, dawg, I'm talking
about fucking any girl you want

24:54.677 --> 24:56.837
- all in your mind.
- But it's so weird.

24:56.957 --> 24:58.856
We're having a little humrat feast.

24:58.976 --> 25:00.887
Make sure Garza and Lilley
get their share.

25:01.007 --> 25:02.047
It's only fair!

25:02.167 --> 25:04.290
If the Iraqis can burn our supply truck,

25:04.410 --> 25:06.961
we can partake
in their humanitarian rations.

25:07.516 --> 25:09.118
How do you jerk off with no hands?

25:09.238 --> 25:11.612
You need one hand at last
to hold the cock book.

25:11.732 --> 25:13.723
Dawg, I'm talking about
the power of the mind.

25:13.883 --> 25:15.788
You don't need a cock book.
You don't need shit.

25:15.908 --> 25:18.346
- Gotta have a cock book.
- Need to meditate on the perfect fuck.

25:18.466 --> 25:19.908
Wasik'll jerk off to anything.

25:20.028 --> 25:21.902
I seen him punishing his unit

25:22.022 --> 25:24.637
during a screening
of "Pocahontas" at Mathilda.

25:24.757 --> 25:25.907
That's tragic.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.409
I liked <i>Pocahontas.</i>

25:28.698 --> 25:30.960
- Wonderful music.
- Naw, naw, naw, Brad.

25:31.504 --> 25:33.368
You cannot say that you like

25:33.940 --> 25:35.090
<i>Pocahontas.</i>

25:35.764 --> 25:38.284
The genocide of my people
is turned into a cartoon musical

25:38.404 --> 25:40.054
with a singing raccoon?

25:40.510 --> 25:41.968
I mean, think about it, dawg,

25:42.088 --> 25:44.730
the real story of Pocahontas
is about a bunch of white boys

25:44.850 --> 25:46.078
who come to my land,

25:46.198 --> 25:48.385
bribe the corrupt indian chief,
kill off all the warriors

25:48.505 --> 25:50.631
and fuck the indian princess silly.

25:50.751 --> 25:52.929
Would the white man make
a story about Auschwitz,

25:53.049 --> 25:54.891
where the inmate falls in love
with the guard

25:55.011 --> 25:57.206
and they go off singing love songs
with dancing swastikas?

25:57.326 --> 25:59.408
My great grandfather killed indians.

25:59.929 --> 26:01.768
Up in Michigan for money.

26:02.734 --> 26:03.684
Trombley,

26:04.577 --> 26:07.362
you are the first white motherfucker
to say something like that to me.

26:07.482 --> 26:08.215
Yeah?

26:08.683 --> 26:12.033
Back in the fishing village
where I'm from, Los Angeles,

26:12.844 --> 26:15.416
Most white motherfuckers
that talk about their people,

26:15.536 --> 26:17.485
they say they got
a Native American ancestor

26:17.605 --> 26:19.657
to pretend to be down with me.
But here you are,

26:19.777 --> 26:20.925
coming the other way.

26:21.045 --> 26:22.709
Poke, what the fuck are you anyway?

26:23.545 --> 26:25.781
Your wife is half white,
you talk like you're black,

26:25.901 --> 26:27.638
most of your friends are fucking white,

26:27.758 --> 26:29.090
and every once in a while,

26:29.649 --> 26:31.697
when you feel like it,
you throw in with the indians.

26:31.817 --> 26:32.730
What the fuck?

26:32.850 --> 26:36.473
Is it just that you're whatever race
happens to be cool at the moment?

26:36.633 --> 26:39.122
<i>Make sure you have
your flak and helmets on.</i>

26:39.613 --> 26:41.163
You got a point, dawg.

26:41.568 --> 26:43.145
I don't hang out with Mexicans.

26:43.517 --> 26:44.567
I'm Mexican.

26:46.363 --> 26:48.558
Mexicans got $20,000 stereos,

26:48.895 --> 26:51.235
lots of guns and every time I go
into a liquor store with one,

26:51.355 --> 26:53.705
I'm afraid we're gonna rob the place.

26:54.331 --> 26:56.481
Mexicans are scary motherfuckers.

26:57.763 --> 27:00.421
What the fuck does any of this
have to do with jerking off?

27:00.541 --> 27:02.091
Formation, devil dogs.

27:02.507 --> 27:03.857
What's up, Gunny?

27:04.319 --> 27:06.097
Company Commander will address you.

27:06.217 --> 27:08.462
And I know you're mad at the battalion.

27:08.777 --> 27:10.227
Because as you know,

27:10.760 --> 27:12.194
I've been talking to you

27:12.314 --> 27:13.764
and I've heard you.

27:14.797 --> 27:16.447
And I know you're angry.

27:17.421 --> 27:19.555
I know you're angry that
the supply truck was burned

27:19.675 --> 27:21.925
and you don't have that food to eat.

27:22.609 --> 27:23.859
You told me this

27:24.399 --> 27:25.649
and I heard you.

27:26.828 --> 27:28.900
But you shouldn't be angry
at your command.

27:29.856 --> 27:31.739
If you're angry at your command,

27:31.859 --> 27:35.909
then you are saying it was our fault
that the supply truck was burned.

27:36.336 --> 27:37.909
But we didn't burn the supply truck.

27:38.069 --> 27:39.803
The enemy burned the supply truck.

27:39.923 --> 27:41.873
They took your food from you.

27:42.383 --> 27:44.748
That's the important thing to remember.

27:44.909 --> 27:46.994
It was the enemy
who stole your food from you

27:47.114 --> 27:49.864
and you should be
really really mad at them.

27:53.699 --> 27:56.149
Before we step off on this next mission,

27:56.573 --> 27:59.123
I'm reminding you
of who your enemy is...

28:01.639 --> 28:02.789
... the enemy.

28:03.319 --> 28:04.569
Thank you, sir!

28:05.711 --> 28:06.521
Company,

28:07.149 --> 28:08.508
Attenhut!

28:10.268 --> 28:11.218
Fall out!

28:16.128 --> 28:17.178
I'm in awe.

28:24.472 --> 28:26.536
All Hitman Two Victors, be advised,

28:26.656 --> 28:30.061
our objective is Al Hayy,
15 kliks up the A.S.R. Break.

28:30.977 --> 28:34.048
We've been tasked to screen
R.C.T. One's movement. Break.

28:34.740 --> 28:37.287
Assassin is on point,
two kliks ahead of us.

28:37.407 --> 28:40.057
Going towards the enemy.
Stay alert. Over.

28:40.548 --> 28:42.474
Hitman Two, this is Two One Alpha...

28:44.503 --> 28:46.895
We got friendly Victors
hauling ass southbound.

28:49.794 --> 28:52.456
Baghdad's the other way, ya bitches!

28:52.576 --> 28:54.378
Army, probably third I.D.

28:54.665 --> 28:56.528
Yeah, probably ran outta tampons.

28:56.864 --> 28:58.573
Going all the way back to the P.X.

29:02.489 --> 29:03.639
What the fuck?

29:04.540 --> 29:05.690
That's Alpha.

29:06.879 --> 29:08.416
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

29:08.576 --> 29:09.726
Interrogative:

29:09.995 --> 29:13.046
why is our sister company
moving in the opposite direction?

29:13.455 --> 29:14.525
<i>Roger, Two One.</i>

29:14.645 --> 29:17.216
<i>I'm on the nets right now
trying to get some S.A. on this.</i>

29:24.741 --> 29:27.616
The thing to remember is
they'll never take a Recon Marine alive.

29:27.736 --> 29:28.768
Hoorah, sir.

29:29.969 --> 29:30.799
Hoorah.

29:37.675 --> 29:39.781
All Hitman Two Victors,
this is Hitman Two Actual.

29:40.696 --> 29:43.910
I have confirmation that Alpha has been
detached for a different mission. Break.

29:45.825 --> 29:47.789
<i>A Marine supply unit
was ambushed South of here</i>

29:47.949 --> 29:51.254
<i>and a captured Marine was executed
in the city center. Break.</i>

29:53.432 --> 29:54.629
<i>We have our own mission.</i>

29:54.954 --> 29:56.131
Let's keep our focus.

29:57.356 --> 29:59.716
Brah, this is what
I was telling you about.

29:59.877 --> 30:02.304
That Marine from that supply unit
that was captured,

30:02.424 --> 30:04.385
they strung his ass up
in the middle of the town.

30:04.505 --> 30:05.807
No, they crucified him.

30:06.489 --> 30:07.539
On a cross?

30:07.799 --> 30:10.648
Yeah, it has to be.
That's what crucifixion is.

30:11.127 --> 30:13.077
Don't you ever read the bible?

30:13.451 --> 30:14.901
Maybe it's bullshit.

30:15.735 --> 30:18.050
I mean, they say they killed
1,000 Marines in Nasiriyah

30:18.170 --> 30:19.464
and that's bullshit.

30:19.584 --> 30:20.864
And that thing about J. Lo?

30:21.024 --> 30:23.874
Man, she ain't dead.
At least I don't think so.

30:26.119 --> 30:28.269
This is Two Three for Two Actual.

30:29.052 --> 30:32.101
Can you confirm the captured Marine
was crucified? Over.

30:34.489 --> 30:36.239
That's affirmative. Over.

30:59.637 --> 31:03.421
We have a fairly large scale urban area
which is operating business as usual

31:03.541 --> 31:06.117
with uniformed Republican Guard units
mobilized.

31:06.472 --> 31:08.205
Civilians wise enough to leave the city

31:08.325 --> 31:11.075
have the entire east side
from which to flee.

31:11.238 --> 31:13.629
As far as I'm concerned,
we have a Marine in this city,

31:13.749 --> 31:16.499
and we will do what it takes
to recover him.

31:18.314 --> 31:19.447
In our D.N.A.

31:22.227 --> 31:24.959
The main M.S.R. running
from military installations

31:25.079 --> 31:26.942
to Ba'ath political targets is here.

31:27.062 --> 31:29.474
We have three ancillary service routes.

31:29.594 --> 31:31.658
The main M.S.R. we've named Cheetahs,

31:31.778 --> 31:34.831
followed by A.S.R. Rhino,
A.S.R. Crazy Horse

31:35.155 --> 31:39.062
and this one running alongside the
central mosque is A.S.E. Seventh Veil.

31:41.362 --> 31:42.862
The N.C.Os in my two shop

31:43.022 --> 31:45.990
who did the mapping named the streets
after their favorite titty bars.

31:47.644 --> 31:50.786
Am I to understand you want us to hold
a blocking here along A.S.R. Rhino?

31:50.906 --> 31:53.997
You'll be a Sparrowhawk force too, for
any of our units that get cut off here.

31:54.117 --> 31:56.567
But generally speaking
that is affirmative.

31:57.746 --> 31:59.744
We're going to hit this town hard.

31:59.900 --> 32:02.430
That comes down
from General Mattis himself.

32:02.828 --> 32:05.802
If the army wants to lose a supply unit
then cut and run while

32:05.962 --> 32:08.805
a captured female soldier
becomes a poster girl on Al Jazeera,

32:08.965 --> 32:12.244
that's their business.
But Marines will not go down that path.

32:13.707 --> 32:15.421
At 0 dawn hundred tomorrow

32:15.836 --> 32:18.606
the Navy is launching
some precision guided whoopass.

32:19.393 --> 32:21.544
Rounds completed here at 0430.

32:22.142 --> 32:24.412
That takes out the Ba'ath
political headquarters

32:24.532 --> 32:26.124
and these barracks here.

32:26.523 --> 32:29.742
At 0 dawn hundred my tanks
are moving in, followed by my infantry.

32:30.530 --> 32:33.439
In addition to blocking here,
I want your recon units

32:34.287 --> 32:36.290
to target our oncall artillery.

32:36.494 --> 32:38.999
Anything you see
between A.S.R. Seventh Veil,

32:39.119 --> 32:40.431
and A.S.R. Rhino.

32:41.790 --> 32:43.914
You can be as loose
with the R.O.E. as you like.

32:44.034 --> 32:46.145
This whole city is declared hostile.

33:00.707 --> 33:01.987
We got armor for this.

33:02.107 --> 33:04.245
Yeah, we're gonna fuck some shit up.

33:06.656 --> 33:07.905
Fucking plain as day.

33:09.035 --> 33:11.701
Republican guard walking armed
in a uniform

33:12.172 --> 33:13.286
like it's cool.

33:13.446 --> 33:16.289
Plus look at all the trash
from the pog supply units going north.

33:16.449 --> 33:18.039
They throw all shit on the road.

33:18.159 --> 33:20.376
Explain to me what genius
has all our supply convoys

33:20.536 --> 33:24.440
going past a town where this fucking
Iraqi military unit's never surrendered.

33:24.647 --> 33:25.746
Check it out!

33:27.101 --> 33:28.144
Pound cake.

33:30.195 --> 33:31.618
Right off the ground.

33:31.941 --> 33:35.138
The fucking pogs got so much food,
they just toss the shit.

33:36.974 --> 33:39.548
- You're eating discards?
- I'm fucking hungry.

33:39.668 --> 33:42.104
This Marine needs more
than one meal a day.

33:51.399 --> 33:53.201
You see any jalapeño and cheese?

33:58.408 --> 33:59.540
Fucking smell here.

33:59.749 --> 34:01.259
That's the death smell.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.132
That's rotting haji.

34:03.803 --> 34:07.241
- That shit gets me hard.
- There's gonna be a lot more like them.

34:07.657 --> 34:10.552
Gonna be a motherfucking flyfest
in that town.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.143
That one's a kid.

34:13.478 --> 34:15.158
Future fucking terrorist.

34:15.545 --> 34:18.600
Come dark, I'll piss on each one
of those stinking dead hajis.

34:18.719 --> 34:20.713
They fucking put an American on a cross.

34:20.833 --> 34:22.920
A fucking American Marine, man.

34:23.987 --> 34:25.349
With your permission, Colonel,

34:25.469 --> 34:28.185
as soon as your men step off, I'd like
to try to insert some of my teams

34:28.304 --> 34:30.446
into one of these buildings
along the M.S.R.,

34:30.639 --> 34:33.614
set up an O.P. and support your men
with more effective fire missions.

34:33.735 --> 34:35.025
I like that, Captain.

34:35.146 --> 34:37.357
We give your sniper units a good clear.

34:39.279 --> 34:40.396
What the fuck?

34:46.096 --> 34:47.485
Can I help you, sir?

34:47.719 --> 34:50.657
Colonel, I've been sent to apprise you
of some late breaking developments.

34:50.777 --> 34:54.010
Sir, I got off the net with CENTCOM,
and he has been given command authority.

34:54.130 --> 34:55.453
Backchannel authority.

34:55.572 --> 34:57.846
For all intent and purpose I'm not here.

34:58.917 --> 35:00.035
Gentlemen,

35:00.389 --> 35:01.970
this man is the mission.

35:02.693 --> 35:04.105
We've good reason to believe

35:04.265 --> 35:05.812
that Ali Hassan Almajid,

35:05.932 --> 35:08.693
a.k.a. Chemical Ali,
is holed up in Ash Shatrah.

35:09.743 --> 35:13.698
Our mission is recovering a U.S. Marine
reported to be inside that town.

35:13.858 --> 35:17.511
Our force is aware of that concern.
Recovering the Marine is a priority but

35:17.631 --> 35:19.399
this man is the highest priority.

35:19.519 --> 35:22.509
I can assure you my men are prepared
for any contingency.

35:22.629 --> 35:25.180
And if the defenders put up
a stiffer fight because some big shot...

35:25.300 --> 35:26.085
Colonel,

35:26.820 --> 35:28.937
this is no longer a Marine operation.

35:32.817 --> 35:34.918
This is Brigadier General Zaid Alhamadi,

35:35.038 --> 35:38.097
commander of liberated Iraq's
first brigade of freedom fighters.

35:38.257 --> 35:41.861
Trained with our assistance,
they're moving into position after dark.

35:43.782 --> 35:45.815
Advanced units will infiltrate
Ash Shatrah,

35:45.935 --> 35:47.607
make contact with resistance elements,

35:47.800 --> 35:51.136
and following the show planned
by the Navy, they attack at dawn.

35:56.176 --> 35:57.622
It's historic, gentlemen.

35:57.742 --> 35:59.160
We're spearheading what will be

35:59.320 --> 36:02.079
the model effort of joint American
liberated Iraq cooperation.

36:11.312 --> 36:13.673
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
this is Hitman Two Actual.</i>

36:13.793 --> 36:15.491
<i>We are two kliks out from Al Hayy.</i>

36:15.611 --> 36:18.262
<i>Updated reports state there are
small pockets of resistance</i>

36:18.422 --> 36:20.025
<i>south of the city. Break.</i>

36:20.157 --> 36:22.892
<i>Godfather F.A.C. is pushing Cobras north
to sweep the routes.</i>

36:23.513 --> 36:25.908
<i>Observe everything. Admire nothing.</i>

36:26.347 --> 36:29.147
Roger that.
We're monitoring internet at this time.

36:34.809 --> 36:37.448
Cobras spotted a zil
carrying uniformed Iraqis.

36:37.838 --> 36:39.529
Alpha's got a cool mission.

36:39.860 --> 36:40.853
This sucks.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.048
They found R.P.Gs
200 meters up the road in a ditch.

36:49.391 --> 36:52.171
This would have been
the perfect shitting opportunity.

36:56.209 --> 36:57.009
Fuck it.

36:57.176 --> 36:58.455
I'm going for it.

37:06.807 --> 37:09.950
When to shit is a big deal
for Sergeant Colbert, isn't it?

37:10.248 --> 37:12.502
In a war zone, Marines shit tactically.

37:12.787 --> 37:13.797
Piss too.

37:14.264 --> 37:18.246
Sometimes the situation requires that
you do not leave the vehicle regardless.

37:20.484 --> 37:22.448
The adult diapers, I get it.

38:20.946 --> 38:22.041
Daddy's back.

38:22.358 --> 38:24.781
I know, man.
I am seriously impressed.

38:25.180 --> 38:26.903
Taking dumps under pressure, man,

38:27.023 --> 38:29.118
that is our Iceman's Achilles' heel.

38:29.571 --> 38:31.003
Or Achilles' asshole.

38:31.282 --> 38:33.414
Holy shit, Brad's our Achilles' anus.

38:40.677 --> 38:43.240
Shit, man,
it's really pretty country out here.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.916
Except for the mortars.

38:45.505 --> 38:47.096
Yeah, but they're random.

38:47.216 --> 38:50.164
I mean, come on. It's not like
anybody's scoping you with an A.K.

38:50.284 --> 38:51.995
- It's not personal.
- <i>Hitman Two One,</i>

38:52.115 --> 38:56.022
- <i>rotary says they can't find mortars.</i>
- You gotta let some of this shit go.

38:56.359 --> 38:57.439
Two one copy.

38:58.076 --> 38:59.808
Cobras can't find those mortars

38:59.928 --> 39:02.257
so we're gonna clear
a couple hamlets up the road.

39:02.377 --> 39:03.416
See what we see.

39:10.924 --> 39:14.917
<i>All Hitman Two Victors, counter-battery
reports point of origin in this village.</i>

39:15.082 --> 39:16.691
<i>Our mission is to detain all males</i>

39:16.851 --> 39:18.943
<i>and search all structures. How copy?</i>

39:19.335 --> 39:21.195
<i>Hitman Two, this is Hitman Two Three.</i>

39:21.775 --> 39:24.294
<i>- Solid.
- Hitman Two, this is Two One Alpha.</i>

39:24.608 --> 39:25.607
<i>Solid copy.</i>

39:28.109 --> 39:29.688
<i>Hitman Two One, this is Hitman Two.</i>

39:29.808 --> 39:32.094
<i>We have several military age males
headed north.</i>

39:32.214 --> 39:33.249
<i>Detain them? Over.</i>

39:33.434 --> 39:35.505
Check it out, Brad.
It's our episode of <i>Cops</i>.

39:35.625 --> 39:36.666
<i>Roger that.</i>

39:37.204 --> 39:39.005
- Lt.!
- Get down!

39:40.070 --> 39:42.790
Let's go! Lt.!
I look for hajis. Go, go!

39:42.910 --> 39:45.161
Copy!
Push down to that southern house.

39:45.362 --> 39:46.346
Roger that.

39:46.756 --> 39:47.669
I got it.

39:49.826 --> 39:51.058
<i>Hitman Two Two.</i>

39:51.537 --> 39:54.172
- <i>Push down to the next house. Over.</i>
- Drop!

39:54.292 --> 39:55.952
Get on the deck. Get down.

39:58.487 --> 40:00.619
All right, I got a woman and child.

40:02.391 --> 40:03.738
Shut that motherfucker up.

40:03.898 --> 40:05.352
We got the detainees.

40:08.403 --> 40:10.077
Smells like dead goats in here.

40:11.250 --> 40:12.924
Sergeant, are we checking this hut?

40:13.044 --> 40:14.637
This way. Get up!

40:15.012 --> 40:16.542
Up, get up!

40:20.422 --> 40:21.422
We're good here.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.732
Brad,
check this motherfucker's crib out.

40:34.603 --> 40:36.103
Haji be pimpin', yo.

40:38.323 --> 40:39.275
Sit down!

40:39.963 --> 40:40.858
Sit down.

40:41.018 --> 40:42.276
Chill, chill!

40:45.672 --> 40:46.510
Man...

40:47.926 --> 40:50.151
This brings me back
to my days as a repo man in L.A..

40:50.271 --> 40:51.535
You know what I'm saying?

40:51.695 --> 40:53.579
Women are always the fiercest.

40:54.068 --> 40:56.351
You always gotta look out
for the women.

40:56.471 --> 40:58.944
Doesn't matter
if it's a black bitch from South Central

40:59.064 --> 41:01.553
or some rich white bitch
from Beverly Hills.

41:01.778 --> 41:03.979
Don't matter
if you got a gun or whatever.

41:04.099 --> 41:06.095
They'll come after you, screaming,

41:07.557 --> 41:09.606
like women think they're protected.

41:17.564 --> 41:18.666
Right clear.

41:34.822 --> 41:37.360
<i>Hitman Two Two, this is Hitman Two.
Interrogative:</i>

41:37.480 --> 41:39.458
<i>any signs of the border team activity?
Over.</i>

41:40.506 --> 41:42.647
<i>Hitman Two, this is Hitman Two Two.</i>

41:42.767 --> 41:44.273
<i>Negative... Hitman...</i>

41:44.393 --> 41:45.506
What about the stash?

41:45.692 --> 41:46.702
Leave it.

41:47.865 --> 41:50.485
We're not here
to fuck with their livelihoods.

41:57.500 --> 41:58.504
Leave it.

42:13.117 --> 42:16.170
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
we are pushing on to Al Hayy.</i>

42:16.409 --> 42:19.415
<i>Maintain 25 kph. Maintain dispersion.</i>

42:30.957 --> 42:32.318
We got gunfire!

42:38.024 --> 42:39.226
Get cover!

42:51.340 --> 42:52.294
Are you okay?

42:52.414 --> 42:53.741
Ray, get out of the vehicle.

42:58.717 --> 42:59.955
Trombley, come on!

43:02.034 --> 43:03.803
Trombley, get the fuck down!

43:04.731 --> 43:05.890
That's a Zeus.

43:06.176 --> 43:07.755
What the fuck is a Zeus?

43:08.198 --> 43:11.800
It's a russian antiaircraft gun.
There's a lot of barrels on that bitch.

43:11.960 --> 43:14.553
Trombley, you psycho motherfucker,
get the fuck down.

43:20.637 --> 43:21.894
Hit our tires, man!

43:24.262 --> 43:25.449
That's cool.

43:26.709 --> 43:27.920
Hey, Sergeant,

43:28.310 --> 43:30.277
I think I see
where the fire's coming from.

43:31.814 --> 43:34.198
What the fuck
is that crazy piece of shit doing?

43:34.358 --> 43:35.554
It's at our 11,

43:35.855 --> 43:37.221
about 2 000 yards...

43:37.341 --> 43:39.870
- <i>Scarface, this is Hitman Two.</i>
- ... right by that tree.

43:40.030 --> 43:41.297
Hasser, get on your gun.

43:41.417 --> 43:43.157
<i>We copy standby. Gimme that.</i>

43:43.640 --> 43:46.533
<i>My position is Papa Victor 2-9-1</i>

43:46.653 --> 43:49.463
<i>7-5-8, marked by orange air panel.</i>

43:51.339 --> 43:53.436
11 O'clock, 2,000 meters.

43:56.109 --> 43:59.181
<i>- Stand by for amplifying instructions.
- Scarface, Ready to copy.</i>

43:59.484 --> 44:01.200
Left 50 at 20.

44:03.262 --> 44:05.145
Left 10, up 10.

44:05.389 --> 44:07.773
<i>We've visual on your position.
Determine target?</i>

44:10.365 --> 44:11.819
<i>Scarface's contact off.</i>

44:12.633 --> 44:13.570
On target!

44:16.543 --> 44:18.466
<i>Scarface Two One coming in hot.</i>

44:18.833 --> 44:19.883
<i>Missile away.</i>

44:25.325 --> 44:26.339
Get some!

44:29.257 --> 44:30.707
<i>Stand by for B.D.A.</i>

44:31.793 --> 44:34.900
<i>... utility 3tac4 destroyed.
Good work, Scarface.</i>

44:35.020 --> 44:36.092
All right, boys,

44:36.253 --> 44:37.445
that's lunch!

44:38.457 --> 44:40.135
You psycho badass.

44:42.177 --> 44:43.877
This may sound weird,

44:44.741 --> 44:45.970
but deep down,

44:46.537 --> 44:49.714
I kinda wanted
to see what it feels like to get shot.

44:50.028 --> 44:51.847
I mean, not actually shot, but

44:53.622 --> 44:57.621
I just get more nervous watching
a game show at home on tv than I do here

44:58.951 --> 45:00.514
in all this, you know?

45:05.279 --> 45:06.095
Hey.

45:08.149 --> 45:09.584
Not bad for an asshole.

45:29.932 --> 45:30.938
Tomahawks?

45:31.337 --> 45:32.587
Fucking a right.

45:33.119 --> 45:35.651
Joke of it is those things
cost like a million and a half each.

45:35.944 --> 45:38.655
We could probably buy the town
and every motherfucker in it for less.

45:38.815 --> 45:42.814
You pay me half that, I'll hump in some
C4 and blow the shit up my own self.

46:13.263 --> 46:16.182
Pulled out all the stops
for these guys, didn't we?

46:16.734 --> 46:18.362
It's as if there's a plan.

46:27.038 --> 46:28.746
That's two tootsie rolls.

46:29.152 --> 46:32.113
At least we get something
out of this bullshit mission.

46:35.952 --> 46:37.402
Yo, John, back off!

46:37.561 --> 46:39.496
It's a fucking Charm dump.

46:40.067 --> 46:41.885
Even pogs got common sense.

46:57.697 --> 46:59.318
Those the hajis on our side.

47:00.272 --> 47:02.042
Where'd they fucking go to?

47:03.818 --> 47:06.141
General AlhamadI's operatives
were compromised shortly

47:06.261 --> 47:07.952
after entering the town last night.

47:08.440 --> 47:11.034
They were executed
by Ba'ath party loyalists.

47:11.154 --> 47:14.250
Clearly, this impacted negatively
on the morale of his forces.

47:14.906 --> 47:16.906
So your freedom fighters ran, huh?

47:17.415 --> 47:19.471
Colonel, our liberation
wasn't a cakewalk either.

47:19.591 --> 47:23.141
If you rember, there were
some grim moments at valley forge.

47:32.530 --> 47:34.203
We lost 24 hours.

47:36.896 --> 47:40.346
Sir, it seems general washington
made off with my Oakleys.

47:41.975 --> 47:43.488
Smallarms fire is picking up.

47:48.282 --> 47:50.702
Assassin Two Three,
this is Assassin Actual.

47:50.822 --> 47:52.113
Interrogative:

47:52.233 --> 47:54.457
what are you seeing
from your position? Over.

48:02.552 --> 48:04.457
Assassin, this is Two Three. Over.

48:04.577 --> 48:06.719
<i>This is Assassin Actual. Send it.</i>

48:06.839 --> 48:09.013
We have eyes on the northeast
corner of the town

48:09.217 --> 48:11.807
<i>and there appears to be some
dismantling of the outer barricade,</i>

48:12.260 --> 48:14.328
<i>general revelry and</i>

48:14.448 --> 48:17.117
<i>what passes for iraqi house music.</i>

48:17.619 --> 48:19.601
Roger that.
We're seeing the same thing.

48:19.721 --> 48:22.561
Make sure your men know that that A.K.
Fire is celebratory. Over.

48:22.681 --> 48:23.731
Roger that.

48:24.283 --> 48:25.696
They're celebrating.

48:25.942 --> 48:27.508
They've been liberated.

48:28.729 --> 48:29.493
By who?

48:30.909 --> 48:31.710
Damn,

48:32.010 --> 48:33.208
they're fucking it up.

48:33.532 --> 48:35.581
I thought we were gonna fuck it up.

48:37.346 --> 48:39.596
It's happening all along our lines.

48:39.909 --> 48:42.380
Republican guard
abandoning their positions.

48:43.598 --> 48:46.186
Assassin Two Three,
this is Assassin Actual.

48:46.535 --> 48:49.303
Prepare your men to move into
the town and find that mato. Over.

49:08.471 --> 49:10.908
On top of that, you hold that.

49:27.747 --> 49:31.312
Stop the men from fraternizing.
Get them back into armed posture.

49:31.482 --> 49:33.920
Scott, take off that shit and stow it.

49:34.375 --> 49:36.767
Back to the Humvees.
Get on that fucking gun!

49:42.002 --> 49:44.026
<i>All Assassin call signs, be advised.</i>

49:44.146 --> 49:47.069
<i>You are not cleared
to engage without hostile intent.</i>

49:47.230 --> 49:48.663
Do we light them up?

49:48.783 --> 49:50.333
We're not cleared hot.

49:50.784 --> 49:53.118
Only if they show hostile intent.

49:56.648 --> 49:58.803
These are the bad guys, right?

49:59.468 --> 50:01.167
We're just gonna let them get away?

50:13.707 --> 50:16.611
New orders. We're moving out
and relinking with battalion.

50:16.731 --> 50:18.726
We've barely given
this town a once over.

50:18.930 --> 50:21.171
I know. Those are my orders.

50:21.291 --> 50:22.441
Hey, mount up.

50:23.932 --> 50:25.923
<i>All Assassin Victors,
this is Assassin Actual.</i>

50:26.043 --> 50:28.945
<i>We've been ordered to link back up
with battalion at grid papa victor</i>

50:29.148 --> 50:30.979
<i>978214. Over.</i>

50:34.167 --> 50:35.317
Haji tortillas

50:36.045 --> 50:37.495
They're pretty good.

50:37.892 --> 50:39.542
That's that khubz shit.

50:39.918 --> 50:41.368
That's their bread.

50:42.387 --> 50:44.337
What about the missing Marine?

50:54.638 --> 50:56.925
The trickiest part
will be entering Al Hayy.

50:57.045 --> 50:59.975
It's a city four kliks long,
about 100,000 inhabitants.

51:01.172 --> 51:04.481
We're coming up the west side of it,
then cutting across here.

51:05.270 --> 51:07.811
The convoy will be forced through
a series of S turns

51:07.931 --> 51:09.902
and we're crossing
four separate bridges.

51:10.421 --> 51:12.377
Our objective is the M.S.R.
on the north side.

51:12.497 --> 51:16.177
We're seizing it ahead of R.C.T. One's
assault through the city.

51:16.434 --> 51:18.010
It's the only way out of town,

51:18.130 --> 51:20.614
and we're the blocking force.
- Who's on point, Sir?

51:20.734 --> 51:22.868
Good news is it's Charlie company.

51:22.988 --> 51:24.709
The bad news is that once we get here,

51:25.044 --> 51:27.086
our platoon is tasked with holding it.

51:30.047 --> 51:32.716
I know this looks like some
"Black Hawk Down" shit we're doing,

51:32.920 --> 51:36.011
but we'll be the ones initiating
contact. Not the bad guys.

51:40.234 --> 51:42.586
All right, gentlemen, you heard the man.

51:43.183 --> 51:44.520
Let's go set up a roadblock.

51:55.418 --> 51:56.991
<i>All gunners, pick up your sectors.</i>

52:17.973 --> 52:21.128
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
raptor is taking fire on point.</i>

52:21.431 --> 52:22.722
Charlie's in contact.

52:22.842 --> 52:24.231
Contact with what?

52:24.873 --> 52:26.404
I can't find a target.

52:36.987 --> 52:40.932
<i>All Hitman Two Victors, Raptor is
suppressing targets with Cobras. Break.</i>

52:41.052 --> 52:44.368
<i>They're taking heavy smallarms
fire two kliks to the north.</i>

52:44.617 --> 52:47.883
<i>Keep your guns on those danger areas.
Watch the rooftops.</i>

53:08.975 --> 53:10.525
Lord, see us through.

53:11.076 --> 53:12.602
Lord, see us through.

53:13.817 --> 53:15.367
Lord, see us through.

53:22.162 --> 53:23.453
He's not a target.

53:45.553 --> 53:46.997
<i>Hitman, this is Godfather Five.</i>

53:47.117 --> 53:49.145
<i>Raptor's roadblock is
set two kliks to the north.</i>

53:49.348 --> 53:50.615
Jacks, let's push.

53:52.551 --> 53:56.434
<i>Confirm that you have sealed off all
northbound traffic from Al Hayy. Over.</i>

53:56.554 --> 53:59.504
Ray, tell Godfather
our roadblock is set up too.

54:01.116 --> 54:03.493
Godfather, Godfather, this is Hitman.

54:10.782 --> 54:13.746
God damn, man, son of a bitch and fuck.

54:14.620 --> 54:17.883
The price of Copenhagen just went up.

54:21.443 --> 54:22.495
Oh shit.

54:35.879 --> 54:37.529
Hey, check it out, Dawg.

54:42.550 --> 54:44.000
All right, guns up!

54:51.092 --> 54:52.972
Garza, Lovell.

54:53.241 --> 54:54.419
Fire warnings.

55:32.328 --> 55:33.457
Fire warnings.

55:40.220 --> 55:41.423
Light it the fuck up.

56:33.599 --> 56:35.949
Did they understand the warning shots?

56:39.464 --> 56:41.150
The R.O.E. aren't a lot of help here.

56:43.142 --> 56:44.392
We're all alone.

56:47.760 --> 56:49.907
And to our south,
we've got an entire hostile town

56:50.027 --> 56:51.737
in between us and closest friendlies.

56:51.857 --> 56:53.490
And 40 kilometers to our north,

56:53.610 --> 56:55.956
we've got an full mechanized
division up there in Al Kut.

56:57.721 --> 56:59.614
And there's 70 of us, brad,

56:59.989 --> 57:01.347
holding this road.

57:13.533 --> 57:16.283
We got trucks with
weapons flanking us there.

57:21.171 --> 57:24.021
Get on the hook.
Let's schwack them with arty.

57:25.293 --> 57:29.245
I say again, at least two dozen military
vehicles flanking us to the northwest

57:29.506 --> 57:33.378
at grid november alpha 954631.

57:33.498 --> 57:34.308
Over.

57:34.975 --> 57:38.032
<i>Stand by Hitman Two.
We're working up a fire mission. Over.</i>

57:38.152 --> 57:39.542
That stopped 'em.

57:39.703 --> 57:40.742
God damn.

57:43.434 --> 57:46.462
Sir, we need the translator
up at Charlie's position.

57:47.604 --> 57:48.604
Rudy!

57:49.604 --> 57:52.654
- Yes, sir?
- Get Meesh to the northern roadblock.

58:31.520 --> 58:33.696
Ask him why he didn't stop
at our warning shots.

58:33.816 --> 58:35.666
Ask him why he kept coming.

58:46.413 --> 58:47.863
He said he's sorry.

58:50.065 --> 58:52.197
He wants to know
if he can take his daughter's body.

58:58.078 --> 58:59.926
He said he's sorry?

59:00.367 --> 59:02.534
We just fucking killed his daughter.

59:03.234 --> 59:05.384
Arabs don't grieve the way you do.

59:05.568 --> 59:07.218
It's different for him.

59:48.130 --> 59:49.980
What happened up at Charlie?

01:00:01.061 --> 01:00:03.228
Shit's really pretty, isn't it?

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:19.244
Garza got him right between the eyes.

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:22.951
Where his eyes used to be.

01:00:34.711 --> 01:00:37.761
Sounds like R.C.T. One's fucking
shit up on their way through town?

01:00:37.965 --> 01:00:39.406
Fuck yeah, they are.

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.470
I felt cold as a motherfucker
shooting those guys.

01:00:56.591 --> 01:00:57.628
Incoming.

01:01:07.857 --> 01:01:08.834
It's Alpha.

01:01:10.655 --> 01:01:11.734
Alpha's home.

01:01:13.812 --> 01:01:15.799
Put it out to the team leaders
We're oscar mike.

01:01:16.937 --> 01:01:19.162
<i>Hitman Two, this is Assassin Actual.</i>

01:01:19.606 --> 01:01:21.972
<i>We are reentering friendly lines
from the south.</i>

01:01:25.012 --> 01:01:28.354
They think we're cool 'cause
we're so good at blowing shit up.

01:01:37.465 --> 01:01:39.507
Lt. says we're on the move.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.425
How'd it go?

01:01:58.672 --> 01:02:00.322
Brought all my men back.

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:01.925
And Ash Shatrah?

01:02:02.141 --> 01:02:03.359
What happened there?

01:02:03.479 --> 01:02:04.514
Nate...

01:02:04.734 --> 01:02:06.689
You wouldn't believe it, man.

01:02:10.675 --> 01:02:12.625
Y'all find the missing Marine?

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:44.294
Thank you, Ray.

01:03:44.414 --> 01:03:46.115
Thank you, Sergeant.
