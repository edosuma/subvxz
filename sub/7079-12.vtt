WEBVTT

00:05.547 --> 00:07.633
Abed, what are you doing?

00:07.925 --> 00:10.219
Freelancing.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.304
You're not a spy
for the city, are you?

00:12.596 --> 00:14.196
They've been sent
footage of my classroom

00:14.348 --> 00:17.184
and pronounced me no worse than
the teachers that work hard.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.516
Can't tell you who I'm
working for, it's a surprise.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.022
Well, don't get in the way.

00:22.314 --> 00:23.917
You know the rules, Jeff.
The sooner you ignore me,

00:23.941 --> 00:25.651
the sooner I stop
being a factor.

00:25.943 --> 00:28.362
All right, people! Yesterday

00:28.654 --> 00:30.822
I wrote the word "law"

00:31.448 --> 00:32.448
on the board.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.701
This time, don't erase it,

00:34.993 --> 00:37.329
and maybe tomorrow
we'll get even further.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.432
Now, I'm told Garrett has
prepared a presentation

00:39.456 --> 00:41.333
for extra credit.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.425
By the way, everyone
in class gets the credit,

00:43.502 --> 00:45.104
because I'm not sure how much
I should encourage this.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.630
Go ahead, Garrett. Thank you.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.095
My presentation
is about marriage law.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.723
This is me, Garrett.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.517
I'm in your class.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.311
This is Stacy.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.146
She is in our class as well.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.025
This is what I want.

01:08.277 --> 01:09.486
Oh, Garrett.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.487
Stacy,

01:12.155 --> 01:13.198
will you marry me?

01:19.538 --> 01:21.790
Yes! Yes, Garrett. Yes, I will.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.125
Oh, Garrett!

01:27.379 --> 01:28.940
Garrett and I have
been seeing each other

01:28.964 --> 01:31.174
for 16 months,
2 weeks, and 4 days.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.635
We met at the school store,
Pencils and Such.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.846
He said he was there
for the such.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.699
I remember I was sweating
a lot and breathing heavy,

01:37.723 --> 01:40.267
and my heart felt like it was
going to burst in my chest,

01:40.559 --> 01:43.145
but the day I met Stacy most of
those symptoms actually declined.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.190
- Are you quite done?
- Yeah.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.922
Garrett wanted the
proposal recorded.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.461
He thought his family
might want to see proof.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.645
So now what are you shooting?

01:51.862 --> 01:53.739
You had a strange
look on your face.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.907
Oh, you're noticing faces now?
Mmm-hmm.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.177
Aren't you still smelling hair
to tell Frankie from Annie?

01:58.201 --> 01:59.202
Yeah.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.205
Well, it's official!
I'm getting laid!

02:02.497 --> 02:05.500
♪ Give me some rope
Tie me to dream

02:05.792 --> 02:08.711
♪ Give me the hope
to run out of steam

02:09.003 --> 02:12.174
♪ Somebody said it can be here

02:12.466 --> 02:16.053
♪ We could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year

02:16.345 --> 02:21.016
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay

02:21.308 --> 02:25.604
♪ One by one they all
just fade away ♪

02:33.028 --> 02:34.738
What are you doing?

02:37.449 --> 02:38.575
Stop.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.577
Hey, stop!

02:40.869 --> 02:43.246
If you don't put that silly
thing away, I swear,

02:43.538 --> 02:45.666
I'm gonna stop loving you.

02:45.957 --> 02:46.957
Oh, that's it.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.965
Happy birthday.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.676
What are you two doing?

02:55.967 --> 02:57.687
We're doing Annie's
"missing lover" footage.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.262
You know in movies
where the hero's

02:59.554 --> 03:00.948
wife or girlfriend
is dead or missing,

03:00.972 --> 03:02.182
and so he sits in the dark,

03:02.474 --> 03:04.393
and he watches her
in a home movie or...

03:04.685 --> 03:06.269
Or hologram. Or hologram.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.842
Over and over, and she's always
beautiful and full of love

03:09.064 --> 03:10.464
almost to the point
of being stupid.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.918
We're making footage
like that for me,

03:11.942 --> 03:13.169
in case I get kidnapped
or murdered.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.361
Oh, super healthy, guys.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.013
The Health Department called,
they don't want anything back.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.187
Britta, don't
look at the camera.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.202
Okay, look at the camera.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.537
Today's Garrett's wedding.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.056
For those who
don't know Garrett,

03:25.080 --> 03:26.360
he is a guy we don't really know

03:26.581 --> 03:28.792
that we've known for, like,
six years at school.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.084
The funny looking guy.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.628
Britta, mean.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.046
Sorry.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.841
The eccentric looking guy?

03:36.133 --> 03:38.468
"What's happening?
Everything's going wrong."

03:38.760 --> 03:40.178
That guy. Uh,
remember when we said

03:40.470 --> 03:41.513
we were cleaning?

03:41.805 --> 03:44.266
Yeah, but remember
about Abed's documentary?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.198
His documentary
is about what we're doing,

03:46.393 --> 03:47.602
and we're cleaning.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.521
Yeah, but if we're
both cleaning,

03:49.813 --> 03:52.190
then there's nobody
to explain why.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.025
She doesn't understand
filmmaking.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.404
I lived in New York. What
else should we talk about?

04:00.657 --> 04:03.368
We've volunteered our
apartment as a staging area

04:03.660 --> 04:05.120
where our friends can get ready

04:05.412 --> 04:07.539
and keep each other on time.
Ugh!

04:07.831 --> 04:10.041
The thing to
understand about our friends

04:10.333 --> 04:14.337
is that, "Friends,"
isn't an adequate label.

04:14.629 --> 04:19.216
We're an intensely,
intimately bonded crew.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.678
God, I can't. No, no!

04:21.970 --> 04:26.683
Do you want flashy and forward
or cherry and classic?

04:26.975 --> 04:28.643
Do you have black?

04:28.935 --> 04:30.729
That's a "no." That
beleaguered sigh means,

04:31.021 --> 04:32.261
"No, I can't have black nails."

04:32.397 --> 04:34.566
Don't look at the camera.
You absolutely can,

04:34.858 --> 04:37.444
and we all will when
our bodies decompose.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.256
Please, don't Jim
the camera like that.

04:39.488 --> 04:40.906
Jim the camera? The color black

04:41.198 --> 04:42.998
hasn't had anything to do...
It's not a color.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.303
With death or edginess since '89.
It's the absence of color.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.745
My accountant has black nails.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.830
Your what? Don't jump on that.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.641
"My accountant,"
it's a figure of speech.

04:50.665 --> 04:54.002
It's a form of speech
called, "Making things up."

04:54.294 --> 04:55.504
Abed, can you get that?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.756
I can film you getting it.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.341
It's open! Is it?

04:59.633 --> 05:00.967
I don't know, let's see.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.846
Frankie!

05:05.138 --> 05:07.516
So I didn't put on my wedding
clothes, like you said,

05:07.808 --> 05:10.727
so we can get dressed together
and be girls together.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.062
This is gonna be fun.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.629
Annie and Britta
told me to come over

05:15.690 --> 05:17.943
and get ready with them
for Garrett's wedding.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.611
I didn't say, "No."

05:19.903 --> 05:21.947
Who says, "No,"
to something like that?

05:22.239 --> 05:26.034
A cold, off-putting,
incompatible person.

05:26.326 --> 05:30.705
The kind of person that turns
a sleepover into a... Stoning.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.875
I had, um, rocks thrown at me.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.586
Biblical, igneous, jagged,

05:36.878 --> 05:39.005
hateful, pointy, ninja rocks,

05:39.297 --> 05:40.617
and that's not gonna
happen again.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.638
What have you been up to?

05:46.930 --> 05:48.181
I think you already asked that.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.475
Did you answer? Didn't I?

05:50.767 --> 05:53.478
I think I did. I
don't think you did.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.064
Oh, that's not like me.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.899
Well, maybe you're nervous.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.610
No. No.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.755
Well, why don't we just
say that if you did answer,

06:02.779 --> 06:04.698
we forgot, so we're
asking again.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.202
Oh. I have been working, um...

06:09.494 --> 06:12.330
And I've been tending
to my personal affairs.

06:12.622 --> 06:13.623
Hmm.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.589
My... I don't know
if I've mentioned...

06:20.881 --> 06:22.161
Um, one of my
sisters is, well...

06:22.424 --> 06:25.093
You know, one of
them is deceased,

06:25.385 --> 06:27.762
and the other is...

06:28.054 --> 06:30.682
Um...

06:30.974 --> 06:32.893
Mentally retarded...

06:33.184 --> 06:35.103
Panty raid!

06:36.563 --> 06:38.064
When I say, "Drink,"
you say, "Now."

06:38.356 --> 06:39.858
- Drink! Drink!
- Now! Now!

06:40.150 --> 06:42.068
When I say, "Drink,"
you say, "Now." Drink!

06:42.360 --> 06:43.360
Now! Drink!

06:43.445 --> 06:44.946
Now!

06:46.197 --> 06:47.490
Hey, what are you guys doing?

06:47.782 --> 06:49.385
We got to go, the wedding
starts in, like, 40 minutes.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.410
Ohh!

06:50.702 --> 06:52.829
We padded the time!

06:53.121 --> 06:54.682
We lied to you because
we knew you'd be late.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.207
So we lied to you
about the time.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.126
Yeah.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.670
You don't need perfect
people to make a perfect team.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.048
You need people whose flaws
feed into each other.

07:03.340 --> 07:06.176
It's, uh, what
do you call it? Um...

07:06.468 --> 07:07.552
Codependent. Synergy.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.488
For instance, there might
be something Britta

07:09.512 --> 07:11.014
hates doing but
Annie loves doing,

07:11.306 --> 07:13.034
or there might be something
that Annie hates doing,

07:13.058 --> 07:15.560
but she does it anyways
because what she really loves

07:15.852 --> 07:17.270
is to feel useful.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.898
You literally just
defined codependency.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.108
Here's to synergy.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.903
Oh, look at you,
you little helper.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.237
Okay.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.573
Do you, Garrett,
take Jack Nicholson

07:28.865 --> 07:30.450
- to be your lawfully wedded wife?
- Oh!

07:32.577 --> 07:34.704
I do!

07:34.996 --> 07:36.915
I do, Johnny!

07:39.084 --> 07:40.335
We invented a new game.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.963
Celebrity Garrett Marriage.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.840
Christian Slater, to be your
lawfully wedded wife?

07:46.132 --> 07:47.759
I do.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.303
I do.

07:50.595 --> 07:51.638
Boo!

07:53.098 --> 07:54.099
Yeah, well listen to him.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.059
We were genius
to pad the time margin

07:56.351 --> 07:58.751
because now we have, like, three
more hours to play the game.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.106
Okay, do you, Garrett...
Mmm-hmm.

08:01.398 --> 08:05.026
Take Aubrey Plaza
to be your wife?

08:05.318 --> 08:06.903
I do.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.656
I do.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.783
Wait, what do you mean
three more hours?

08:12.075 --> 08:13.201
How is that even possible?

08:16.079 --> 08:18.164
What time is the wedding?

08:18.456 --> 08:19.916
Wait, what time is it now?

08:20.208 --> 08:21.835
We're late! We're late!

08:26.089 --> 08:28.633
Jeff, you and I can drive
together, meet you at the car!

08:28.925 --> 08:30.205
What? Yeah, we'll
drive together.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.904
We are not driving together.
It's all been settled.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.054
Nothing was settled.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.977
They left me home alone!

08:39.269 --> 08:41.604
I'm home alone!

08:41.895 --> 08:43.481
Well, not really. What?

08:46.401 --> 08:47.837
What the hell are you doing?
Come on, let's go.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.571
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Okay.

08:49.863 --> 08:50.863
Jeez.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.993
- Abed, you too, come on.
- Oh, yeah.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.584
We are here to witness the
union of Garrett and Stacy

09:02.876 --> 09:04.419
in the eyes of,

09:04.711 --> 09:07.505
well, in the eyes of
whatever power you choose.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.899
Personally, I find the notion

09:08.923 --> 09:11.468
of choosing to be
needlessly limited.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.304
What if I'm capable
of total contradiction?

09:14.596 --> 09:16.765
What if science and religion

09:17.057 --> 09:20.518
were mine to wield as I choose?

09:20.810 --> 09:22.228
What if I'm God?

09:22.979 --> 09:26.232
What if I'm God?

09:29.486 --> 09:31.154
It is likely that I am not,

09:31.446 --> 09:34.407
but I think it's
totally out of line

09:34.699 --> 09:36.910
to take that possibility
off of the table.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.162
Now, I understand that
vows have been written?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.414
Stacy,

09:41.706 --> 09:45.168
when I first saw you, looking
at you made me feel good.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.545
Touching you felt better,
and knowing you

09:47.837 --> 09:50.173
made me realize that without you

09:50.465 --> 09:52.550
I am incomplete.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.469
I know I look pretty complete.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.973
Somebody over there laughed
at that the wrong way.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.643
You are my body and my soul.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.770
You are my favorite video game.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.982
Yes! Come on. Guys, guys,
guys, guys, guys, guys.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.733
Everybody's looking at us.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.150
Shh.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.880
Your "Shh" was louder
than what I said.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.028
Shh.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.282
Shh.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.661
Welcome.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.353
Everyone back there,
you're welcome.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.164
Please, join us.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.834
Any of those people
could be God.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.418
- Over there?
- Yeah.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.386
Garrett, since we met

10:36.678 --> 10:38.179
you have felt so familiar.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.723
I love making
sandwiches with you.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.017
I love folding towels with you.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.312
I love giving you your pain
killers at the end of the day.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.604
Aw!

10:48.481 --> 10:49.481
Well, that...

10:49.691 --> 10:50.733
Those aren't really vows.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.069
That's a list of things
you love about me.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.863
I am so sorry. It's okay.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.576
Garrett, do you take Stacy to
be your lawfully wedded wife?

10:59.868 --> 11:01.286
I do.

11:01.578 --> 11:02.996
Stacy, do you take Garrett

11:03.288 --> 11:05.039
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

11:05.331 --> 11:08.626
To have and to hold
and to honor?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.837
Yes. Yes, I do.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.597
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Garrett Lambert.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.249
Garrett, you may
kiss Mrs. Garrett.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:34.694 --> 11:35.862
Where the party at?

11:36.279 --> 11:37.280
Ooh.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.951
Okay, let's endure this.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.828
Are we nailing today, or what?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.306
Who would have thought that
Barrett's wedding would be

11:45.330 --> 11:46.581
the best day of our lives?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.684
Definitely not Garrett
since his name's not Barrett.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.335
Whoopsie. Me say a wrong a name.

11:50.627 --> 11:51.753
Oh, racist.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.685
Oh, no, you a racist.
You guys are racist.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.341
Everyone from here
to there is racist.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.512
Oh.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.806
- Having a good time?
- Oh, yes.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.098
Are you Garrett's mom?

12:05.266 --> 12:06.266
I sure am.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.685
Oh!

12:07.977 --> 12:11.147
I think you guys could
maybe take a step back,

12:11.439 --> 12:12.941
gain a little perspective,

12:13.233 --> 12:15.401
so you don't wreck
the whole night

12:15.693 --> 12:18.238
for some really
wonderful people.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.740
You came to a wedding
in the middle of the vows

12:21.032 --> 12:22.533
through a bush.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.870
I'm not Dr. Phil, but

12:26.162 --> 12:27.562
I don't want my son
to kill himself,

12:27.789 --> 12:29.165
so do what you got to do.

12:36.923 --> 12:37.923
Holy crap.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.509
What have we done? JEFF: Okay.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.345
We just got checked,
and it was pretty deserved,

12:42.637 --> 12:44.138
but we're not just
gonna stand here

12:44.430 --> 12:45.510
and lick our wounds either.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.808
Jeff is right,

12:47.100 --> 12:49.060
and that chipper
passive aggressive lady,

12:49.352 --> 12:52.188
she's right too, so let's
spread out and...

12:52.480 --> 12:56.734
Be the best wedding guests
anyone has ever seen.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.295
Yes. I'm not gonna
over think it,

12:58.319 --> 12:59.404
I'm just gonna try it.

12:59.696 --> 13:00.989
Okay, okay. Yes, yes, yes.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.782
Yay. Mazel tov.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.617
So, a stranger walked over

13:04.909 --> 13:06.160
to our very proud group

13:06.452 --> 13:08.830
and smashed our pride
into pieces with a hammer,

13:09.122 --> 13:11.207
which definitely felt
like a disaster.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.836
Then I started to pick up
the pieces of our pride

13:15.128 --> 13:16.587
and, weirdly enough,

13:16.879 --> 13:20.383
the first piece I picked
up was my own pride.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.635
All of it.
It's almost like groups,

13:22.927 --> 13:27.307
and people in groups, can never
be complete at the same time.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.726
Does that make any sense?

13:30.018 --> 13:31.018
No?

13:32.061 --> 13:34.022
Well, that's your problem.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.107
I love you, Abed.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.151
Do I know how to be
a good wedding guest?

13:38.443 --> 13:41.487
Yes, I do. A little too well,
that's the problem.

13:41.779 --> 13:46.117
My name is Elroy Patashnik,
and from 2006 to 2009,

13:46.409 --> 13:48.536
I was addicted to
encouraging white people.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.582
All right, now there's a man
who knows his meatballs.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.542
It started as simple survival.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.002
The tech industry in the 90s?

13:56.294 --> 13:57.378
This face, this voice,

13:57.670 --> 13:59.315
they're either going
to help you or hold you back.

13:59.339 --> 14:03.176
So you tap the gas because,
well, why tap the brake?

14:03.468 --> 14:07.221
Oh, you know, you know
what you're doing.

14:07.513 --> 14:11.017
This man knows
exactly what he's doing.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.186
I learned the cheat code.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.937
White people like encouragement.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.549
It really doesn't
matter what for.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.232
Now that's a container
for liquid.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.644
I never felt like a sellout.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.003
I never laughed
at anything unfunny,

14:21.027 --> 14:22.904
never said anything untrue.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.196
The thing is,

14:24.280 --> 14:27.575
and this will sound racist,

14:27.867 --> 14:29.452
white people
are very discouraged,

14:29.744 --> 14:31.412
and very discouraging
to each other.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.184
Sweetie, you're
getting meatball juice

14:33.373 --> 14:34.540
everywhere but your plate.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.935
I think I'm doing better than
you are with your asparagus.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.629
Oh, now that's the way
to handle a meatball,

14:39.921 --> 14:43.925
and look at you,
working that asparagus.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.676
So, the day
you start telling them,

14:45.968 --> 14:48.763
"Hey, just do what
you're doing..."

14:49.055 --> 14:50.890
I love you. I love you.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.934
You feel like a superhero.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.020
What's the danger? Why'd I stop?

14:56.312 --> 15:00.525
Well, same as anything else
that makes you feel good.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.057
If you don't put a lid on it...

15:02.151 --> 15:05.488
♪ Oh, look at these pants

15:07.031 --> 15:09.575
♪ He should keep on wearing

15:09.867 --> 15:13.246
♪ Keep on wearing his pants ♪

15:16.249 --> 15:17.708
There's no lid.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.628
Stacy has a 90-year-old
memaw here.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.673
I pushed her around the dance
floor. I think she liked it.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.341
Now, that's Polly.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.761
No, Great Aunt Polly
is Garrett's side.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.555
I haven't met her.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.807
Oh, my God, do you think
she saw me pushing Memaw,

15:32.974 --> 15:35.059
and now she's wondering
what's wrong with her?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.978
I'll be right back. Annie,

15:37.270 --> 15:39.510
the world will still need you
after you finish your cake.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.398
Am I that bad?

15:41.649 --> 15:43.401
We have the same dragon.

15:43.693 --> 15:44.902
Eventually, you will slay it,

15:45.194 --> 15:47.738
or train it, or dissolve
in its stomach.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.408
Its name is "Helping Others."

15:50.700 --> 15:52.380
If I train it, can I give
it a cooler name?

15:52.535 --> 15:54.620
If you train it, you can
do anything you want.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.122
If you slay it, I don't know.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.833
I guess you get a new
dragon named "Yourself,"

15:59.125 --> 16:00.325
and then you'd be Jeff Winger.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.087
Yeah, that guy needs help.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.511
What would you name your dragon?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.847
I think we need a list
of dragon names.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.182
Yeah.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.476
"And then we need to
get you away from Jeff."

16:16.767 --> 16:17.852
Is what I wanted to say,

16:18.144 --> 16:20.188
but how is that my business?

16:22.732 --> 16:25.651
You don't show these to
people when you finish them?

16:25.943 --> 16:28.321
No. Okay. Good.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.910
So, then why do you
make them, again?

16:34.202 --> 16:37.371
It relaxes me. It's like
knitting with less discipline.

16:37.663 --> 16:41.709
Princess Fire Breath, Sir Pent, Dr.
Rachel Spinetail,

16:42.001 --> 16:43.669
Holly Hotbreath... Ugh...

16:43.961 --> 16:45.922
Jimmy Talon, Christian Scale.

16:46.214 --> 16:48.094
I got into a bit of a
celebrity pun barrel here.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.594
Carson Scaly, Jude Claw,
Arianna Puffington.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.139
Hi, are these your
biggest ice cubes?

16:55.431 --> 16:56.599
No, you're boisterous.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.142
Where's my brother?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.120
I got a thing to say
about my... Where's Garrett?

17:00.144 --> 17:01.979
There has been a plot twist

17:02.271 --> 17:04.607
in the story of our comeback
as wedding guests.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.317
Garrett's older brother, Bones,

17:06.608 --> 17:08.736
has relapsed during
his weekend pass

17:09.028 --> 17:11.739
and will be unable
to do the Best Man Toast.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.366
You got him? Hold onto him.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.701
So I took Garrett's mom aside

17:15.992 --> 17:18.037
and told her after our
behavior today

17:18.329 --> 17:20.330
it was the least
I could do for them.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.040
And I'm not gonna
Winger-speech it.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.960
This is a thing of substance.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.213
We pulled all the inside info
based on all the mingling,

17:27.505 --> 17:30.633
and this toast
is rocket-fueled selflessness.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.885
And this wedding's gonna
regret the day it thought

17:32.969 --> 17:34.470
we'd make it about us.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.973
Because we are about to be
the first guests in history

17:37.265 --> 17:40.434
to out toast the entire
wedding party.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.436
God, I love my job.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.273
Wait, this isn't my job.
God, I love myself.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.733
That was Stacy's

17:48.025 --> 17:50.027
first time!

17:52.613 --> 17:54.073
But it's not gonna
be her last time,

17:54.365 --> 17:56.742
right, Garrett?

17:57.034 --> 17:59.078
Oh, my God... So
many classic toast errors.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.663
Afire hydrant could follow this.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.415
I love you so much.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.126
And please keep painting.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.253
Don't let Garrett...
Don't... Hey.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.880
Don't let Garrett
keep you from painting.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.215
Okay, I'm done.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.968
Okay, Stacy's friend,
Andi, everybody.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.970
Next up, we have
a replacement best man,

18:16.262 --> 18:17.822
Garrett's friend
from Greendale College,

18:17.847 --> 18:19.599
Jeffrey Winger.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.768
There's a lot of things
I can say about this couple.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.021
They're both in my class
at Greendale,

18:25.313 --> 18:28.232
and like all my students,
I give them until about June.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.361
No, you guys
will be fine forever,

18:32.653 --> 18:35.364
as long as Stacy never
lets Andi babysit.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.659
Or go near a child,

18:38.951 --> 18:41.704
or be in the same town
as a pair of scissors.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.290
This girl's a wreck.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.501
He's being too mean.

18:47.793 --> 18:48.833
Oh, he's reading the room.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.278
Andi was a bummer,
they needed this.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.673
Two people, merging their lives.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.925
But that means two families

18:55.217 --> 18:57.803
are leaving here tonight as one,

18:58.095 --> 18:59.305
that's a big deal.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.766
Now, my friends
and I came here tonight

19:02.058 --> 19:03.058
as outsiders,

19:03.225 --> 19:04.602
but thanks to some good advice

19:04.894 --> 19:05.936
we spent the night

19:06.228 --> 19:08.272
learning about these two clans

19:08.564 --> 19:10.608
of outsiders.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.070
We learned that Garrett's
Uncle Tony is a photographer.

19:14.362 --> 19:15.722
But, Uncle Tony,
did you know that.

19:15.780 --> 19:16.780
Stacy's friend Laurence

19:17.031 --> 19:19.241
makes and sells frames?

19:19.533 --> 19:21.253
Look each other up,
get some business going.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.371
Oh, and Garrett's neighbor Dawn

19:23.663 --> 19:24.872
loves vintage cars.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.209
Stacy's chiropractor,
Susan, brought her dad.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.710
And guess what?

19:30.002 --> 19:32.672
Her dad worked in an
automobile factory in the 60s.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.799
Yeah, I know.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.943
These are the kind of things you
learn being the biggest jerks

19:36.967 --> 19:38.260
at a wedding.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.232
Here's another golden
nugget in the gravel.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.598
Some of you have worked
the dance floor

19:42.890 --> 19:45.643
with Garrett's divine
Great Aunt Polly,

19:45.935 --> 19:47.937
90 years young.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.897
And some of you chatted

19:50.189 --> 19:51.524
with Stacy's memaw,

19:51.816 --> 19:53.734
also 90 years young.

19:56.278 --> 19:59.824
Now, I don't know if they've
even met before tonight,

20:00.116 --> 20:03.035
but we did learn
that both of them

20:03.327 --> 20:06.664
were born in the same town,

20:06.956 --> 20:08.541
Sheridan, Wyoming.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.001
Now, Garrett and Stacy,
would you mind

20:11.293 --> 20:12.461
getting them both out here?

20:12.753 --> 20:14.422
All right. Yeah.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.716
I know Aunt Polly's here,

20:17.007 --> 20:18.634
isn't she beautiful?

20:20.845 --> 20:23.889
Okay, who has got eyes on Memaw?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.436
This is Memaw.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.980
Oh, this is Memaw.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.690
Okay, I feel like an idiot.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.191
I'm so, so sorry.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.026
Uh, Garrett, where's Aunt Polly?

20:39.780 --> 20:42.074
Okay. Uh...

20:42.366 --> 20:44.827
Now I don't feel as stupid,

20:45.119 --> 20:47.788
uh, because either
someone here is lying,

20:48.080 --> 20:50.332
or this family is a lot
closer than we thought.

20:59.884 --> 21:00.885
And now,

21:01.177 --> 21:03.179
this is a man that knows

21:03.471 --> 21:04.972
how to marry his cousin.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.311
None of this would have happened

21:23.407 --> 21:24.727
if I wasn't always
trying to help.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.507
Actually, none of this
would have happened

21:26.744 --> 21:28.013
if I hadn't tried helping
you with your helpfulness.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.717
Oh, don't torture
yourself with that logic.

21:29.914 --> 21:32.041
None of us would have met
if Hitler hadn't been born.

21:32.333 --> 21:33.518
Also, none of Britta's arguments

21:33.542 --> 21:35.628
would have a default analogy.
Excuse me?

21:35.920 --> 21:37.439
He's saying you go
to the Hitler well a lot.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.631
What are you, Hitler, Hitler?

21:38.923 --> 21:41.342
Okay, Britta, we're
all the worst right now.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.719
Take a day off. I did.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.680
Between us ruining the ceremony
and ruining the reception,

21:46.972 --> 21:49.975
when we were all just individual
people I wasn't the worst.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.644
I'm only the worst
with you guys.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.687
- Well, me too.
- Me too.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.356
I was a good dean
before you guys.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.751
You can't disprove it. I
relapsed because of you guys.

21:57.775 --> 21:58.975
What? Oh, it's not a big deal,

21:59.068 --> 22:00.820
white people problems.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.111
I like this group.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.718
I'm at my best
when I'm with you guys.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.908
Well, that clinches it.
Separate cabs? Separate cabs?

22:06.200 --> 22:07.576
Separate cabs?

22:07.868 --> 22:09.078
Hi.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.412
For those still with us,

22:10.704 --> 22:12.498
we won't be cutting
the cake or dancing,

22:12.790 --> 22:14.990
and I believe there was a guy
in a Homer Simpson costume

22:15.167 --> 22:16.335
that was gonna surprise me.

22:16.627 --> 22:19.129
That won't be necessary.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.091
Drive safe,
and thank you for coming.

22:22.383 --> 22:23.676
What are you going to do?

22:23.968 --> 22:25.344
Chang!

22:25.636 --> 22:26.929
We're going home.

22:27.221 --> 22:29.181
- Are you gonna stay married?
- Chang!

22:29.473 --> 22:31.100
We consulted with a lawyer,

22:31.392 --> 22:33.936
and it is legal in this
state to marry your cousin,

22:34.228 --> 22:35.896
but after talking to our family

22:36.188 --> 22:37.731
we feel an annulment
is warranted.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.042
- What? No, screw that.
- Chang.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.568
Chang, get back here.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.696
Screw you, guys. No, this
family is so screwed up

22:43.988 --> 22:45.708
you thought you were
two different families.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.075
Now that you know you're not,
you can't wait to leave?

22:48.367 --> 22:49.660
And you want this
guy to do what?

22:49.952 --> 22:52.371
Forget he's in love? For you?

22:52.663 --> 22:54.582
You want him to take one
for this crappy team?

22:54.874 --> 22:55.874
Let him finish.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.143
They were letting
me finish, sir.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.377
I know. I was being sarcastic.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.170
Okay, you know...

23:05.926 --> 23:08.679
Garrett, who loves you
here more than Stacy?

23:10.556 --> 23:12.600
Nobody. Stacy,

23:12.892 --> 23:15.686
is it your fault Garrett's
your cousin? No.

23:15.978 --> 23:17.938
Is anyone here going to
make less fun of these two

23:18.188 --> 23:21.108
or be better friends to them,
no matter what they do?

23:21.400 --> 23:22.985
No.

23:23.277 --> 23:25.738
It's you against the world,
and you will not win,

23:26.030 --> 23:29.408
but you get to make
your moves, not them.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.083
Stacy,

23:41.045 --> 23:44.048
will you be my legally
incestuous wife? Yes.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.758
Everyone stay and eat cake,

23:46.050 --> 23:47.050
or go to hell!

23:50.804 --> 23:51.889
Yeah. Way to go, buddy.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.602
I did it. I did it. This is about me!

23:56.894 --> 23:58.938
I didn't think I could
do it, but I did it.

24:03.484 --> 24:05.402
Smile. Smile! Yay!

24:10.491 --> 24:11.992
♪ Are you

24:12.284 --> 24:14.995
♪ Heaven on Earth, baby ♪

24:16.288 --> 24:18.374
Ugh, so much Jimming.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.674
Wow, what an episode
of Community.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.175
Hi, I'm Briggs Hatton,

24:28.467 --> 24:30.511
credited author
of this week's episode.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.806
You might have noticed an
emphasis on the topic of incest.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.141
Well, that's no accident.
For the past two years,

24:36.433 --> 24:38.519
when not serving as writer's
assistant on Community,

24:38.811 --> 24:40.688
I've been researching incest
on the Internet.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.356
What I found surprised me.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.334
Did you know that first
cousins can have children

24:44.358 --> 24:47.194
without great risk of birth
defect or genetic disease?

24:47.486 --> 24:49.339
That's a quote directly
from The New York Times,

24:49.363 --> 24:50.489
April 4, 2002.

24:50.781 --> 24:53.033
But despite this scientific
fact, state laws

24:53.325 --> 24:56.078
on incest remain inconsistent
and woefully outdated.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.956
I mean, I can make love
to my cousin in Nebraska,

24:59.248 --> 25:00.725
but if I take her on
a date in South Dakota

25:00.749 --> 25:02.501
I'm looking at
15 years prison time.

25:02.793 --> 25:05.838
I told the Community writers
attention must be paid.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.370
They said they'd allow me to
address it on one condition.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.426
At the end of the episode
I must appear

25:10.718 --> 25:12.511
and identify myself as writer.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.472
Look, I'm not trying to tell
you how to feel about incest,

25:15.764 --> 25:17.484
I'm just letting you know
there's more to it

25:17.766 --> 25:19.435
than you've been told.

25:19.727 --> 25:20.811
I'm Briggs Hatton.

25:21.103 --> 25:24.398
I wrote the Community,
Season 6, incest episode.

25:24.690 --> 25:25.899
Good night.

26:01.810 --> 26:02.810
Did you get any of that?
