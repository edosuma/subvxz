WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:03.604
I DON'T FEEL WELL.

00:03.604 --> 00:06.107
SUSAN'S HEALTH
TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.309
(thud)
 SOMEONE CALL 9-1-1.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.441
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME SO MUCH,
KEITH.

00:10.441 --> 00:14.415
ONE RELATIONSHIP CAME
TO A BITTERSWEET END.

00:14.415 --> 00:17.288
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
GET OUT!
 FORGIVE ME, PLEASE.

00:17.288 --> 00:20.051
PLEASE! I LOVE YOU.
 NO, YOU DON'T.

00:20.051 --> 00:22.123
AND ANOTHER ENDED IN BETRAYAL.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.495
(cries)

00:28.199 --> 00:30.701
(Mary Alice) THE SUBURBS
ARE FULL OF PARENTS,

00:30.701 --> 00:35.166
AND EACH PARENT
HAS THEIR OWN STYLE.

00:35.166 --> 00:39.440
THERE'S THE DISCIPLINARIAN...

00:39.440 --> 00:42.813
THE SMOTHERER...

00:42.813 --> 00:47.178
AND THE NEGOTIATOR...

00:47.178 --> 00:50.321
BUT THE ONE THING
THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON...

00:50.321 --> 00:53.124
IS THEY LOVE TO JUDGE

00:53.124 --> 00:56.557
THE PARENTS NEXT DOOR.

00:56.557 --> 01:00.491
(sighs) TAKE YOUR SISTER INSIDE,
SWEETIE.

01:00.491 --> 01:03.564
I NEED TO HAVE
A LITTLE CHAT WITH LEE.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.135
(knock on door)

01:05.135 --> 01:07.568
(violin playing)

01:07.568 --> 01:09.840
HI! I SEE
JENNY'S PRACTICING AGAIN.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.204
TWO HOURS A DAY,
FIVE DAYS A WEEK. (chuckles)

01:13.204 --> 01:16.076
WOW. SHE IS REALLY
INTO THAT VIOLIN.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.309
SOMETIMES. MOSTLY I HAVE
TO FORCE HER TO DO IT.

01:18.309 --> 01:20.611
OHH. BIG MISTAKE.

01:20.611 --> 01:25.216
REALLY? SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE
AN UNSOLICITED OPINION.

01:25.216 --> 01:27.718
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE NEW
TO THIS PARENTING THING,

01:27.718 --> 01:29.720
SO I'M GONNA TELL YOU
HOW IT WORKS--

01:29.720 --> 01:31.762
YOU CAN'T FORCE A KID
TO DO STUFF,

01:31.762 --> 01:34.265
'CAUSE THEN IT JUST LEADS
TO A LOT OF DOOR SLAMMING

01:34.265 --> 01:37.128
AND NAME-CALLING, AND THEN
THE KID GETS ANGRY, TOO.

01:37.128 --> 01:39.130
(both laugh)

01:39.130 --> 01:41.132
WELL, HERE'S THE WAY
I THINK IT WORKS--

01:41.132 --> 01:43.434
JENNY TOLD US
SHE WANTS TO PLAY THE VIOLIN,

01:43.434 --> 01:46.537
SO IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE SURE
SHE STICKS WITH IT.
 BY PUSHING HER.

01:46.537 --> 01:48.139
I'M NOT PUSHING HER.

01:48.139 --> 01:50.211
(speaks Mandarin)

01:50.211 --> 01:52.383
(speaks Mandarin)

01:53.444 --> 01:56.147
WHAT? SHE WANTED
TO LEARN MANDARIN.

01:56.147 --> 01:59.150
LOOK, I DON'T MEAN TO DEVALUE
THE TWO AND A HALF WEEKS

01:59.150 --> 02:02.223
YOU'VE HAD AS A FATHER. I'M
SIMPLY TELLING YOU WHAT WORKS.

02:02.223 --> 02:06.227
SO LET ME ASK YOU--WHAT'S
JUANITA PURSUING ON HER OWN?

02:06.227 --> 02:07.728
HUH?

02:07.728 --> 02:09.630
AS YOU KNOW, THE SCHOOL
TALENT SHOW IS COMING UP.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.803
JENNY'S PLAYING THE VIOLIN.
WHAT'S JUANITA GOING TO DO?

02:12.803 --> 02:14.765
WELL, THAT'S HARD TO SAY.

02:14.765 --> 02:16.767
SEE, THE BEAUTY OF MY METHOD

02:16.767 --> 02:19.540
IS THAT JUANITA HAS EXPLORED
SO MANY... THINGS,

02:19.540 --> 02:21.542
IT'S HARD TO KNOW
WHICH ONE TO SHOWCASE.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.544
WELL, THIS SHOULD BE
INTERESTING--

02:23.544 --> 02:25.546
TWO DIFFERENT
PARENTING PHILOSOPHIES

02:25.546 --> 02:28.549
AND A TALENT SHOW TO PROVE
WHICH ONE OF US IS RIGHT...

02:28.549 --> 02:30.551
IN FRONT
OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

02:30.551 --> 02:34.255
YES. WILL IT BE THE OVERBEARING,
HYPERCRITICAL FATHER...

02:34.255 --> 02:37.228
OR THE LOVING MOM WHO STILL
LOOKS HOT IN THESE SWEATS?

02:37.228 --> 02:38.889
GAME ON.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.662
(door closes)

02:41.662 --> 02:45.296
(TV playing indistinctly)

02:45.296 --> 02:47.798
HEY, SWEETIE, I HEARD
THE TALENT SHOW'S COMING UP.

02:47.798 --> 02:51.942
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
 OH, IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.
WATCH.

02:55.246 --> 02:56.307
(giggles)

02:57.808 --> 02:59.480
(squeaking)

02:59.480 --> 03:03.814
YES, EACH PARENT
HAS THEIR OWN STYLE.

03:03.814 --> 03:05.816
BUT DEEP DOWN,

03:05.816 --> 03:22.303
THEY'RE ALL AFRAID
THEY'RE DOING IT WRONG.

03:22.303 --> 03:25.576
THERE ARE MANY THINGS
THAT BRING US PLEASURE--

03:25.576 --> 03:29.440
BAKING FOR OUR FRIENDS...

03:29.440 --> 03:32.543
HAVING A GOOD LAUGH...

03:32.543 --> 03:36.747
DONATING TO CHARITY.

03:36.747 --> 03:39.250
BUT THE THINGS
THAT BRING US PLEASURE

03:39.250 --> 03:42.323
MAY NOT BE ENOUGH
TO GIVE OUR LIVES MEANING...

03:42.323 --> 03:47.227
WITHOUT SOMEONE TO LOVE.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.931
(door opens)

03:50.931 --> 03:52.433
(door closes)

03:52.433 --> 03:54.905
MORNING, DEAR.
JUST BACK FROM THE STORE.

03:54.905 --> 03:57.338
WHAT THE HELL?

03:57.338 --> 03:59.540
I THOUGHT FOR DINNER,
I COULD MAKE THOSE LAMB CHOPS

03:59.540 --> 04:02.313
YOU LOVE SO MUCH. I GOT
A GREAT TIP FROM THE BUTCHER

04:02.313 --> 04:05.316
ON SEARING THE MEAT FIRST.
 I KICKED YOU
OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

04:05.316 --> 04:08.949
OH, DEAR.
YOU'RE STILL ANGRY WITH ME.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.452
BUT YOU KNOW, PAUL,
EVERY COUPLE HAS THEIR FIGHTS.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.325
AND I'LL ADMIT,
OURS WAS A DOOZY.

04:14.325 --> 04:16.957
THAT WASN'T A FIGHT.
THAT WAS THE END.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.660
Y-YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.
YOU'RE JUST UPSET.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.663
BUT DON'T WORRY.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.035
WE WILL GET PAST THIS.

04:25.035 --> 04:27.798
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

04:27.798 --> 04:30.841
YOU ACTUALLY THINK
I WOULD TAKE YOU BACK?

04:30.841 --> 04:34.274
WAIT. I GET IT.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.548
THIS IS ANOTHER PLOY COOKED UP
BY YOUR SICK MOTHER.

04:37.548 --> 04:39.780
MY MOTHER.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.912
YES.

04:41.912 --> 04:43.954
SHE'S THE ONE YOU'RE MAD AT.

04:43.954 --> 04:45.916
IT'S ALL HER FAULT.

04:45.916 --> 04:49.289
SHE TOLD ME YOU WERE A MONSTER
WHO KILLED AUNT MARTHA.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.922
BUT THEN
I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

04:51.922 --> 04:53.994
AND I REALIZED...

04:53.994 --> 04:56.927
YOU NEVER COULD HAVE
DONE SUCH A THING.

04:59.330 --> 05:01.502
IT WAS ALL A LIE.

05:05.035 --> 05:08.809
OH, BETH.
THAT WAS NO LIE.

05:14.845 --> 05:16.987
YOU DON'T MEAN...

05:24.395 --> 05:25.896
MY GOD.

05:25.896 --> 05:28.959
NOW WE BOTH FEEL BETRAYED.

05:28.959 --> 05:31.331
PAINFUL, ISN'T IT?

05:37.808 --> 05:40.671
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?
 UH, A CLOSET?

05:40.671 --> 05:41.972
NO. IT'S A GRAVEYARD--

05:41.972 --> 05:44.975
A GRAVEYARD FILLED
WITH ALL THE STUFF WE BOUGHT

05:44.975 --> 05:48.048
BECAUSE YOU TOLD US YOU WANTED
TO DO SOMETHING AND THEN QUIT.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.982
REMEMBER THIS? REMEMBER HOW YOU
BEGGED US TO BUY YOU A GUITAR?

05:51.982 --> 05:54.885
THE STRINGS HURT MY FINGERS.
 (thud)

05:54.885 --> 05:57.027
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

05:57.027 --> 05:59.830
VERY EXPENSIVE.
YOU'VE NEVER TOUCHED IT.

05:59.830 --> 06:01.392
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

06:01.392 --> 06:03.994
I USE IT TO PRETEND
I'M PLAYING GUITAR.

06:03.994 --> 06:05.896
JUANITA,
YOU ARE FULL OF IDEAS,

06:05.896 --> 06:08.639
BUT YOU NEVER SEE
ANY OF THEM THROUGH.
 (thud)

06:08.639 --> 06:11.141
WELL, GUESS WHAT? YOU ARE
DOING ONE OF THESE THINGS

06:11.141 --> 06:14.044
AT THAT TALENT SHOW.
 BUT I'M ALREADY
DOING SOMETHING.

06:14.044 --> 06:15.846
NOT THAT.

06:15.846 --> 06:19.880
FINE. IF YOU WON'T
PICK SOMETHING, I WILL.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.911
(inhales deeply) AH.

06:22.853 --> 06:24.154
TAP.

06:24.154 --> 06:26.056
NO.
 YES.

06:26.056 --> 06:28.759
YOU ENJOYED IT. YOU ACTUALLY
SET YOUR PERSONAL RECORD

06:28.759 --> 06:31.862
FOR STICKING WITH SOMETHING--
TWO MONTHS!

06:31.862 --> 06:33.964
BUT IT'S HARD.

06:33.964 --> 06:36.567
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT LIFE--

06:36.567 --> 06:38.899
ANYTHING THAT'S WORTH DOING
IS HARD.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.503
THAT'S WHAT LIFE IS?
 YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO THAT TAP CLASS,

06:42.503 --> 06:44.505
AND YOU'RE GONNA PRACTICE
TWO HOURS A DAY,

06:44.505 --> 06:47.678
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK
UNTIL YOU NAIL IT.
 NO, I'LL DO SOMETHING ELSE
AT THE SHOW.

06:47.678 --> 06:50.010
LIKE WHAT?
 I'LL TELL JOKES.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.883
A JEWISH GUY AND A MEXICAN
WALK INTO A BAR--

06:52.883 --> 06:54.084
NO.

06:57.488 --> 06:58.989
THANK YOU, BREE.

06:58.989 --> 07:02.893
IT ALWAYS BRIGHTENS MY DAY
WHEN YOU INVITE ME TO VISIT.

07:02.893 --> 07:05.926
WELL, REVEREND SYKES,
I VERY MUCH ENJOY YOUR COMPANY.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.629
AS I DO YOURS. (chuckles)

07:08.629 --> 07:10.060
MMM.

07:10.060 --> 07:13.664
SO... HAVE YOU KILLED SOMEONE?

07:13.664 --> 07:15.836
EXCUSE ME?

07:15.836 --> 07:18.138
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE TREATS
YOU PREPARE FOR MY VISITS

07:18.138 --> 07:19.840
ARE A RELIABLE INDICATOR

07:19.840 --> 07:22.442
OF YOUR LEVEL
OF SPIRITUAL TURMOIL.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.444
THE MORE EXQUISITE
THE BAKED GOODS,

07:24.444 --> 07:27.077
THE MORE ANGUISHED YOUR SOUL.
THIS...

07:27.077 --> 07:31.021
IS A HAZELNUT CHOCOLATE CHIP
SCONE WITH CURRANTS.

07:31.021 --> 07:34.685
SO I ASK AGAIN--
HAVE YOU KILLED SOMEONE?

07:34.685 --> 07:36.957
NO. IT'S JUST...

07:36.957 --> 07:39.930
LATELY I FEEL LIKE JOB.

07:39.930 --> 07:42.963
YOU KNOW, JOB,
FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.966
I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THE BOOK, THANK YOU.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.468
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE JOB?

07:48.468 --> 07:51.001
(sighs)

07:53.904 --> 07:57.047
I JUST FEEL THAT GOD HAS
TAKEN EVERYTHING AWAY FROM ME.

07:57.047 --> 08:00.751
I LOST MY BUSINESS,
MY CHILDREN NEVER CALL ME,

08:00.751 --> 08:05.155
AND... MY BOYFRIEND KEITH
HAS LEFT ME.

08:05.155 --> 08:08.689
WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY
BODY BOILS AND DEAD CAMELS,

08:08.689 --> 08:11.221
BUT I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

08:11.221 --> 08:13.994
(slurps) WHEN I COMPLAINED

08:13.994 --> 08:16.496
AFTER I WAS NOT ACCEPTED
INTO YALE DIVINITY SCHOOL,

08:16.496 --> 08:19.129
MY FATHER HAD NO SYMPATHY.

08:19.129 --> 08:23.534
INSTEAD, HE DROVE ME FROM
OUR LOVELY HOME IN CONNECTICUT

08:23.534 --> 08:25.536
TO A DANGEROUS SECTION
OF THE BRONX

08:25.536 --> 08:28.178
AND FORCED ME TO HAND OUT
BLANKETS TO THE HOMELESS.

08:28.178 --> 08:30.841
I SEE. THAT'S THE REASON
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN

08:30.841 --> 08:33.513
SO SENSITIVE
TO THE PLIGHT OF THE POOR.
 PERHAPS.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.515
IT'S CERTAINLY THE REASON
MY FATHER WAS BURIED

08:35.515 --> 08:37.517
IN A SPORT JACKET
HE DETESTED. (chuckles)

08:37.517 --> 08:40.250
THE POINT IS, LOOKING AT
WHAT HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM US

08:40.250 --> 08:42.251
IS A BAD WAY
TO GO THROUGH LIFE.

08:42.251 --> 08:46.156
LOOKING FOR WHAT WE CAN
GIVE TO OTHERS IS FAR BETTER.

08:48.999 --> 08:51.832
COULD YOU PASS ME THE TAPE?

08:54.034 --> 08:58.168
I'M SO GLAD
I ASKED YOU TO HELP.

08:58.168 --> 09:01.071
I'M SORRY.
I'M FEELING A LITTLE FAINT.

09:01.071 --> 09:02.613
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

09:02.613 --> 09:05.275
IT'S LIKE SNEAKERS
MIXED WITH COLOGNE

09:05.275 --> 09:07.978
MIXED WITH "I RAN
AROUND THE BLOCK FOUR TIMES

09:07.978 --> 09:11.251
WEARING A SHIRT MADE OF CHEESE."
 THAT'S PORTER AND PRESTON.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.984
WELL, GET THE PLACE CLEANED.

09:13.984 --> 09:17.127
YEAH. I THINK I'M GONNA
HOLD OFF ON THAT FOR A WHILE.

09:17.127 --> 09:18.288
WHY?

09:18.288 --> 09:19.329
BECAUSE...

09:19.329 --> 09:23.694
(sniffs) I KIND OF
LOVE THIS SMELL.

09:23.694 --> 09:26.697
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE
BECOMING DELIRIOUS.

09:26.697 --> 09:28.699
WE'VE GOTTA
GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

09:28.699 --> 09:31.071
HEY,
YOU DON'T HAVE CHILDREN,

09:31.071 --> 09:33.674
SO YOU DON'T GET IT.

09:33.674 --> 09:38.909
BUT RAISING KIDS
IS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.

09:38.909 --> 09:41.912
IT IS THE MOST MEANINGFUL THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

09:41.912 --> 09:47.587
SO ANYTHING THAT REMINDS ME
OF THEM IS A GOOD THING.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.959
HMM.

09:48.959 --> 09:51.822
YOU MUST BE PRETTY SAD
THEY'RE GONE.

09:51.822 --> 09:53.193
NO.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.095
NO, IT'S RIGHT.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.828
THEY'RE MOVING ON
WITH THEIR LIVES.

09:57.828 --> 10:00.170
IT'S WONDERFUL.

10:02.072 --> 10:05.636
THEN WHY ARE THERE
TEARS IN YOUR EYES?

10:05.636 --> 10:08.979
UM... THAT'S THE SMELL.
(sniffles)

10:08.979 --> 10:11.742
YOU'RE RIGHT.
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

10:13.043 --> 10:14.745
(door closes)

10:20.120 --> 10:24.194
SO... ANY IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME?

10:24.194 --> 10:26.697
AS MUCH AS I ENJOY
PASSING OUT AT RESTAURANTS,

10:26.697 --> 10:29.099
I'M STARTING TO GET
A LITTLE CONCERNED. (chuckles)

10:29.099 --> 10:33.804
ACCORDING TO THESE TESTS, YOUR
CREATINE LEVELS ARE INCREASING.

10:33.804 --> 10:36.406
THAT'S NOT GOOD.
 OH. WHY IS THAT HAPPENING?

10:36.406 --> 10:39.770
I REALIZE THIS ISN'T
A SATISFYING ANSWER, BUT...

10:39.770 --> 10:41.912
WE DON'T KNOW.

10:41.912 --> 10:43.173
SO, UH...

10:43.173 --> 10:45.415
HOW SERIOUS IS IT?

10:45.415 --> 10:49.980
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I TELL
ALL MY PATIENTS--

10:49.980 --> 10:53.253
WE ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
WE CAN TO GET YOU A KIDNEY.

10:53.253 --> 10:56.126
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
LIVE YOUR LIFE.

10:56.126 --> 10:59.690
IF THERE'S THINGS
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING...

10:59.690 --> 11:01.261
DO THEM NOW.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.066
(button clicks)

11:10.040 --> 11:12.943
(whirring)

11:12.943 --> 11:16.146
(sighs)

11:16.146 --> 11:19.149
I THINK FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY
WE SHOULD HAVE A PICNIC...

11:19.149 --> 11:21.351
IN THE WOODS...

11:21.351 --> 11:24.114
WHERE WE GOT MARRIED.

11:24.114 --> 11:25.986
SURE.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.088
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.360
I THINK
WE SHOULD DO IT NOW.

11:30.360 --> 11:33.964
BUT OUR ANNIVERSARY'S
NOT TILL JULY.

11:36.026 --> 11:39.900
WERE WE NOT AT
THE SAME APPOINTMENT JUST NOW?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.702
(elevator stops)

11:59.449 --> 12:01.992
I THOUGHT THAT DIALYSIS WAS
SUPPOSED TO KEEP YOU HEALTHY.

12:01.992 --> 12:04.755
I GUESS IT'S JUST NOT
WORKING FOR ME.

12:04.755 --> 12:07.257
HOW BAD IS THIS?
 PRETTY BAD.

12:07.257 --> 12:08.959
YESTERDAY,
THE DOCTOR'S SECRETARY

12:08.959 --> 12:10.961
HANDED ME
THIS FREE PARKING PASS

12:10.961 --> 12:13.103
WITH THIS... SAD LOOK.

12:13.103 --> 12:14.404
IT WAS LIKE,

12:14.404 --> 12:19.009
"YEAH, YOU'RE DOOMED,
BUT YOUR PARKING'S FREE."

12:19.009 --> 12:22.172
SO IS THIS PASS GOOD
FOR A MONTH? A WEEK?
 (Lynette) GABY!

12:22.172 --> 12:26.116
I JUST WANNA KNOW
WHAT WE'RE FACING HERE.
 ALL I KNOW IS...

12:26.116 --> 12:27.417
I NEED A NEW KIDNEY,

12:27.417 --> 12:30.250
AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
TILL THEY FIND ME ONE.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.253
WELL, HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
TRYING TO FIND A DONOR YOURSELF?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.525
SO FAR, YOU'VE ONLY
ASKED FAMILY.

12:35.525 --> 12:38.188
YEAH, WIDEN THE CIRCLE.
ASK FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.

12:38.188 --> 12:40.260
WELL, THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.233
I MEAN, FINDING A MATCH
IS LIKE 1 IN 1,000.

12:43.233 --> 12:44.534
SO ASK A THOUSAND PEOPLE.

12:44.534 --> 12:46.196
YES. WE CAN HELP.

12:46.196 --> 12:49.800
WE CAN CANVASS THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
PUT UP SIGNS, GO DOOR TO DOOR.

12:49.800 --> 12:53.103
GUYS, IT'S A VITAL ORGAN.

12:53.103 --> 12:55.846
SUSAN,
PEOPLE CARE ABOUT YOU.

12:55.846 --> 12:59.279
YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED
WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO DO.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.152
I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT,

13:02.152 --> 13:04.955
BUT I JUST CAN'T ASK ANYONE

13:04.955 --> 13:07.888
TO MAKE THAT KIND
OF SACRIFICE FOR ME.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.192
I CAN'T.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.194
I'M GONNA GET YOU MORE COFFEE.

13:19.029 --> 13:22.172
MAYBE SHE CAN'T.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.076
BUT I CAN.

13:27.337 --> 13:29.539
DONATE A KIDNEY?

13:29.539 --> 13:31.882
HAVE WE MET?
I'M LIKE 112.

13:31.882 --> 13:34.414
BUT, KAREN, IT'S FOR
OUR DEAR FRIEND SUSAN.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.486
I'M NOT HAVING
ELECTIVE SURGERY.

13:36.486 --> 13:40.220
I TAKE ENOUGH RISK
JUST CLIMBING OUT OF THE TUB.

13:40.220 --> 13:43.123
I DON'T KNOW.
AREN'T THERE SERIOUS RISKS?

13:43.123 --> 13:45.155
ACTUALLY, THE MORTALITY RATE
IS QUITE LOW.

13:45.155 --> 13:48.158
I MEANT THE SCARRING. I'VE SPENT
A LOT OF TIME AT THE GYM

13:48.158 --> 13:49.429
WORKING OFF MY LOVE HANDLES,

13:49.429 --> 13:51.561
AND I WILL NOT GIVE UP
A CHANCE TO GO SHIRTLESS.

13:51.561 --> 13:52.863
NO.
 BUT I--

13:52.863 --> 13:53.904
NO.
 SHE'S REALLY--

13:53.904 --> 13:56.066
NO.
 WOULD YOU JU--

13:56.066 --> 13:57.367
NO.

13:59.209 --> 14:01.171
BREE...

14:01.171 --> 14:02.172
YES?

14:02.172 --> 14:04.414
NO.

14:09.519 --> 14:11.521
(sighs)

14:11.521 --> 14:13.523
I WANT A BABY.

14:13.523 --> 14:16.626
HERE.
I ALSO HAVE A 9-YEAR-OLD.

14:16.626 --> 14:19.329
ONE OF MY OWN.

14:19.329 --> 14:21.391
PREFERABLY A BOY...

14:21.391 --> 14:23.163
AND IN BROWN.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.295
WAIT. YOU'RE SERIOUS?

14:25.295 --> 14:27.497
WHERE DID YOU GET
THIS INCREDIBLY RASH

14:27.497 --> 14:30.340
AND NOT-THOUGHT-OUT IDEA?
 FROM YOU.

14:30.340 --> 14:32.342
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU SAID YESTERDAY

14:32.342 --> 14:35.205
ABOUT KIDS GIVING YOUR LIFE
MEANING? I WANT THAT.

14:35.205 --> 14:37.277
I WANT... MEANING.

14:37.277 --> 14:40.010
IN THE FORM OF A BABY?
 MM.

14:40.010 --> 14:41.511
EXACTLY.

14:41.511 --> 14:44.184
I ALREADY MADE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH AN ADOPTION AGENCY,

14:44.184 --> 14:46.886
WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR
TO MY MANICURIST.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.189
IT WAS LIKE
IT WAS MEANT TO BE.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.191
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

14:51.191 --> 14:54.424
I MEAN, YOUR SOCIAL CALENDAR
IS VERY FULL.

14:54.424 --> 14:56.426
A BABY WOULD CHANGE ALL THAT.

14:56.426 --> 14:59.299
IT REQUIRES A LOT OF SACRIFICE
AND COMPROMISE.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.531
(sighs) MAYBE THE WAY
YOU DO IT.

15:01.531 --> 15:04.104
EXCUSE ME?

15:04.104 --> 15:06.106
YOU WORK YOUR LIFE
 AROUND YOUR KIDS.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.608
I INTEND TO WORK MY CHILD
 INTO MY LIFE.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.610
NO OFFENSE, BUT I THINK

15:10.610 --> 15:14.314
YOU MAKE IT A LOT HARDER
THAN IT HAS TO BE.

15:16.146 --> 15:18.548
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:20.090 --> 15:22.252
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

15:22.252 --> 15:25.595
BUT BEFORE YOU COMMIT
TO BEING A MOM,

15:25.595 --> 15:27.597
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT
A TEST DRIVE?

15:27.597 --> 15:29.229
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:29.229 --> 15:31.231
YOU COULD WATCH PAIGE
SOME NIGHT.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.702
TOM AND I HAVEN'T
BEEN OUT IN A WHILE.

15:32.702 --> 15:34.564
REALLY?
YOU'D LET ME BABYSIT?

15:34.564 --> 15:35.935
(laughs) YEAH!

15:35.935 --> 15:37.968
WHICH ONE IS PAIGE?

15:37.968 --> 15:39.269
THIS ONE.

15:39.269 --> 15:42.012
OH.

15:42.012 --> 15:44.674
I ACCEPT. WOW.

15:44.674 --> 15:47.277
MY FIRST STEP TOWARD
BEING A MOM. (chuckles)

15:47.277 --> 15:51.451
OH, YOU WATCH.
I AM GONNA BE A NATURAL.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.383
(chuckles) AH.

15:53.383 --> 15:55.986
OH, UH, DOES SHE
EAT SHELLFISH?

15:55.986 --> 15:59.229
MAYBE.

15:59.229 --> 16:02.632
SO I GOT US CAVIAR,

16:02.632 --> 16:04.194
SHRIMP PâTé, SMOKED SALMON.

16:04.194 --> 16:07.197
IF THERE'S A PART OF A FISH
THEY CAN OVERCHARGE FOR,

16:07.197 --> 16:08.698
WE HAVE IT.

16:08.698 --> 16:11.701
(chuckles)
 CAN YOU PUT THESE
IN THE BACK? THANKS.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.707
SWEETIE?
 YEAH?

16:17.707 --> 16:21.151
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR DOING THIS TODAY.
 YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:21.151 --> 16:24.554
AND YOU CAN THANK ME AGAIN
WHEN WE GO BACK IN JULY

16:24.554 --> 16:26.256
FOR OUR REAL ANNIVERSARY.

16:26.256 --> 16:29.259
AND I'D REALLY LOVE
IF, FOR THE NEXT EIGHT HOURS,

16:29.259 --> 16:31.221
I'M NOT SICK.
NO TALK OF KIDNEYS.

16:31.221 --> 16:35.165
LET'S JUST HAVE
A FUN, NORMAL DAY, OKAY?

16:35.165 --> 16:37.227
YOU GOT IT.

16:37.227 --> 16:39.629
(laughs)

16:39.629 --> 16:44.274
ONE FUN, NORMAL DAY
IN THE WOODS, COMING UP.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.209
(sighs)

16:49.209 --> 16:50.340
(engine starts)

16:50.340 --> 16:52.342
NOTHING'S GONNA RUIN
THIS TRIP.

16:52.342 --> 16:53.483
(chuckles)

17:04.194 --> 17:05.595
(door closes)

17:05.595 --> 17:08.258
HEY. HOW WAS TAP CLASS?

17:08.258 --> 17:11.560
IT'S TOO HARD.
I DON'T WANNA DO IT ANYMORE.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.104
OH, SWEETIE...

17:14.104 --> 17:17.107
YOU'RE DOING IT.
WE'RE NOT A FAMILY OF QUITTERS.

17:17.107 --> 17:20.240
UGH!
YOU QUIT ALL THE TIME.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.242
YESTERDAY
WE PLAYED HIDE-AND-SEEK.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.214
CELIA AND I LOOKED FOR YOU
FOR AN HOUR

17:24.214 --> 17:26.576
BEFORE WE SAW
YOUR CAR WAS GONE.

17:26.576 --> 17:29.519
(door closes)
 SO I FOUND A GREAT HIDING PLACE
AT THE SHOE STORE.

17:29.519 --> 17:31.281
IT'S NOT QUITTING.

17:31.281 --> 17:33.583
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING--

17:33.583 --> 17:35.585
ARE YOU GETTING BETTER?

17:35.585 --> 17:37.757
I GUESS.
 WELL, THERE YOU GO.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.689
NOW GO UPSTAIRS AND CHANGE.

17:39.689 --> 17:43.293
OH, AND REMEMBER,
TOMORROW'S LESSON'S TWO HOURS.

17:43.293 --> 17:46.096
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
MY FEET FALL OFF.

17:46.096 --> 17:49.799
I CAN'T WAIT
FOR THIS TO BE OVER.

17:49.799 --> 17:53.603
WHY ARE YOU WORKING HER SO HARD?
IT'S A LOUSY SCHOOL TALENT SHOW.

17:53.603 --> 17:56.606
YOU THINK BOB AND LEE
ARE GOING EASY ON THEIR KID?

17:56.606 --> 17:59.609
NO! THEY PUSH HER. THAT GIRL'S
SO GOOD AT THE VIOLIN,

17:59.609 --> 18:02.352
SHE'S PRACTICALLY ASIAN.
 SO THAT'S
 WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

18:02.352 --> 18:04.384
YOU'RE COMPETING
WITH BOB AND LEE.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.417
PFFT. THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
THIS IS ABOUT JUANITA.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.119
I'M BUILDING HER SELF-ESTEEM

18:09.119 --> 18:11.161
AND GIVING HER
A CHANCE TO SHINE.

18:11.161 --> 18:13.323
AND IF A COUPLE
OF SAME-SEX PARENTS

18:13.323 --> 18:17.127
END UP CRYING AT HOME
IN THEIR SILK KIMONOS, SO BE IT.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.232
(sighs)

18:22.232 --> 18:24.534
OH, MIKE,
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

18:24.534 --> 18:26.606
ISN'T IT AS BEAUTIFUL
AS YOU REMEMBER IT?

18:26.606 --> 18:30.480
YEAH. LUCKY I DIDN'T LEAVE IT
ON THE ROOF OF THE CAR.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.543
UGH. WILL YOU FORGET
ABOUT THE PICNIC BASKET?

18:33.543 --> 18:36.516
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:36.516 --> 18:39.319
WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS WE'RE TOGETHER.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.720
AND THERE'S NO--

18:40.720 --> 18:43.293
DAMN IT! THEY FORGOT THE FRIES!
UNBELIEVABLE.

18:43.293 --> 18:47.357
OKAY, MIKE, LOOK AT ME.

18:47.357 --> 18:50.330
THINK BACK EIGHT YEARS,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.332
WHEN WE STOOD IN THIS SPOT

18:52.332 --> 18:54.464
AND WE PLEDGED OUR LOVE
TO EACH OTHER.

18:54.464 --> 18:56.866
(chuckles)
 OH! I KNOW.

18:56.866 --> 19:00.410
LET'S RENEW OUR VOWS.
(giggles)

19:00.410 --> 19:02.812
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

19:02.812 --> 19:05.415
I, MIKE DELFINO,

19:05.415 --> 19:06.776
PROMISE TO LOVE--

19:06.776 --> 19:08.348
(bird squawks)

19:09.919 --> 19:13.283
I, MIKE DELFINO,
PROMISE TO--

19:13.283 --> 19:14.284
(squawk)

19:14.284 --> 19:16.926
(laughs)

19:16.926 --> 19:19.559
IT'S JUST A BIRD.
FORGET IT.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.691
PROMISE TO LOVE
AND HONOR--

19:21.691 --> 19:24.334
(squawking)
 OKAY. NOW HE'S JUST
MOCKING ME.

19:25.835 --> 19:27.297
UH...

19:27.297 --> 19:29.168
MIKE!
 (squawk)

19:29.168 --> 19:30.169
MIKE, STOP!

19:30.169 --> 19:31.941
(thud, squawk)

19:31.941 --> 19:33.443
(thud)

19:33.443 --> 19:36.546
OH, MY GOD.

19:36.546 --> 19:39.479
I-I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HIT THAT BIRD.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.511
YEAH, I KNOW.
 (squawking continues)

19:41.511 --> 19:44.654
I WAS AIMING
FOR THAT ONE.

19:44.654 --> 19:47.657
(indistinct conversations)

19:49.519 --> 19:52.262
AS THE GAYEST PERSON
AT THIS BRUNCH,

19:52.262 --> 19:54.664
I FEEL IT IS MY DUTY TO SAY...
(singsongy) "FABULOUS."

19:54.664 --> 19:58.598
YEAH, BREE, WHAT'S THE OCCASION?
 OH, NOTHING, JUST A LITTLE
GET-TOGETHER FOR FRIENDS.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.731
SMOKED SALMON TARTARE
CORNUCOPIA?
 MMM.

20:04.734 --> 20:06.736
THIS FEELS WEIRD.
SHE'S UP TO SOMETHIN'.

20:06.736 --> 20:09.939
OH, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S JUST A BRUNCH.

20:09.939 --> 20:13.813
EXCUSE ME. IF I COULD BORROW
A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME

20:13.813 --> 20:15.645
FOR A BRIEF PRESENTATION.

20:15.645 --> 20:17.887
OH, GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S AN AMBUSH.
 MM-HMM.

20:17.887 --> 20:19.249
(clicks teeth)

20:19.249 --> 20:21.551
IT SEEMS MANY OF YOU HAVE
SOME MISGUIDED IDEAS

20:21.551 --> 20:24.424
ABOUT KIDNEY DONATION,
SO I HAVE INVITED CRAIG LYNWOOD,

20:24.424 --> 20:26.426
TRANSPLANT COORDINATOR
AT FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL

20:26.426 --> 20:28.958
TO DISPEL
SOME OF THOSE MYTHS.

20:28.958 --> 20:32.462
MR. LYNWOOD, IS IT TRUE THERE'S
AN AGE LIMIT TO DONATING?

20:32.462 --> 20:34.264
NO, NOT NECESSARILY.

20:35.835 --> 20:40.910
AND DOES THE SURGERY
CAUSE UNSIGHTLY SCARRING?

20:40.910 --> 20:43.473
IT'S LAPAROSCOPIC.
THE SCARRING IS MINIMAL.

20:43.473 --> 20:46.416
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE REST OF YOU,

20:46.416 --> 20:48.418
BUT I FIND THAT
VERY REASSURING.

20:48.418 --> 20:50.850
SO NOW THAT
WE HAVE THE FACTS,

20:50.850 --> 20:53.353
I AM SURE YOU'LL ALL
WANT TO GET TESTED.

20:53.353 --> 20:57.457
OKAY, FINE.
I'LL GO IN NEXT WEEK.
 NO NEED.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.589
NURSE DEARBORN?

21:02.792 --> 21:06.466
SO THE LINE FORMS OVER HERE.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.968
AND WE WON'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.700
(lock clicks)

21:10.700 --> 21:13.673
YOU'RE GONNA GET TESTED?

21:13.673 --> 21:18.007
NO.
I THINK I CAN TAKE GABY.

21:18.007 --> 21:19.449
(door closes)

21:19.449 --> 21:22.452
I DON'T KNOW HOW PAUL
FOUND OUT, MAMA, BUT HE DID.

21:22.452 --> 21:26.015
AND THEN... WELL...

21:26.015 --> 21:28.418
HE THREW ME OUT.

21:28.418 --> 21:31.691
HE WAS JUST... SO COLD.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.763
WHAT A SAD STORY.

21:33.763 --> 21:37.367
IF ONLY SOMEONE HAD WARNED YOU
WHAT A BASTARD HE IS.

21:37.367 --> 21:40.400
I KNOW.
YOU WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.732
I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
TO YOU.

21:42.732 --> 21:45.435
BUT I'M GOING
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

21:45.435 --> 21:47.707
OH, BETH.

21:47.707 --> 21:50.380
I CAN'T ALLOW YOU
BACK IN MY LIFE.

21:50.380 --> 21:53.312
YOU HAVE FAILED ME
IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.345
NO. I DIDN'T.

21:55.345 --> 21:57.347
PAUL CONFESSED.

21:57.347 --> 21:59.419
REALLY?

21:59.419 --> 22:03.353
DID YOU GET IT ON TAPE?

22:03.353 --> 22:05.995
DID HE WRITE IT
ON A NAPKIN?

22:05.995 --> 22:09.629
OF COURSE NOT.

22:09.629 --> 22:12.101
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEVER
DONE ANYTHING RIGHT

22:12.101 --> 22:14.564
IN YOUR LIFE.

22:14.564 --> 22:16.506
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

THANKS...
 (door closes)

35:12.711 --> 35:14.413
FOR CHECKING ON ME.

35:14.413 --> 35:17.246
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THE REASON I CAME BY...

35:17.246 --> 35:19.548
HAS THE GENTLEMAN
FROM THE TRANSPLANT OFFICE

35:19.548 --> 35:21.450
REACHED YOU?

35:23.522 --> 35:25.524
WHY?

35:25.524 --> 35:27.396
AM I A MATCH?

35:27.396 --> 35:29.158
YES.

35:29.158 --> 35:31.160
WOW.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.162
SO... WHAT DO I DO NOW?

35:33.162 --> 35:36.165
IS THERE SOMEONE I NEED TO CALL?
ARE THERE FORMS?

35:36.165 --> 35:40.269
WELL, THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY,
BECAUSE I'M A MATCH, TOO.

35:40.269 --> 35:42.341
WHAT?

35:42.341 --> 35:43.642
I KNOW.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.645
TWO IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD.
WE'RE VERY BLESSED. (chuckles)

35:46.645 --> 35:49.418
ANYWAY, I, UH, AM GOING
TO BE SUSAN'S DONOR,

35:49.418 --> 35:52.521
BUT I WANTED
TO THANK YOU FOR...

35:52.521 --> 35:55.784
GETTING TESTED.

35:59.188 --> 36:03.362
WHEN YOU MOVED ONTO THE LANE,
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU A CHANCE.

36:03.362 --> 36:07.496
I SAW YOU AS A WOMAN
WHO MARRIED A MAN I HATED,

36:07.496 --> 36:11.740
AND I SEE NOW THAT YOU'RE
SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

36:11.740 --> 36:16.645
I'M SORRY IT TOOK ME
SO LONG TO REALIZE IT.

36:16.645 --> 36:18.647
WELL, I... (chuckles)

36:18.647 --> 36:22.180
I SHOULD GO.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.353
I WANT TO DO IT.

36:24.353 --> 36:26.515
BETH, NO--

36:26.515 --> 36:28.517
PLEASE, BREE.

36:28.517 --> 36:31.390
LET ME HELP SUSAN.

36:31.390 --> 36:35.324
IT WOULD REALLY
 MEAN A LOT TO ME.

36:35.324 --> 36:40.198
BETH, WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY
MAY NOT MAKE SENSE TO YOU,

36:40.198 --> 36:41.730
BUT, UM...

36:41.730 --> 36:44.573
I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH,
UH...

36:44.573 --> 36:49.808
A DARK TIME...
FEELING ALONE AND UNCONNECTED

36:49.808 --> 36:51.810
AND WONDERING
IF I HAVE A PURPOSE,

36:51.810 --> 36:55.514
SO FOR ME TO BE ABLE
TO DO THIS FOR MY FRIEND...

36:55.514 --> 36:58.317
IT MAY MEAN A LOT TO YOU...

36:58.317 --> 37:01.790
(whispering) BUT IT MEANS
EVERYTHING TO ME.

37:07.696 --> 37:10.959
THANK YOU
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

37:18.537 --> 37:22.371
(door opens and closes)

37:39.658 --> 37:41.660
SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

37:41.660 --> 37:45.634
I BOUGHT THIS FOR THE BABY.

37:45.634 --> 37:46.935
(whispers) WOW.

37:46.935 --> 37:51.400
(normal voice)
EXPENSIVE, FRAGILE, POINTY...

37:51.400 --> 37:53.542
IF ONLY IT WERE FLAMMABLE.

37:53.542 --> 37:57.846
I'M NOT REALLY CUT OUT
TO BE A MOTHER, AM I?

37:57.846 --> 37:59.808
NO.

37:59.808 --> 38:01.810
AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

38:01.810 --> 38:03.882
IT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE.

38:03.882 --> 38:07.986
WHAT'S SAD IS HOW MANY PEOPLE
GO AHEAD AND HAVE KIDS ANYWAY.

38:07.986 --> 38:12.621
WELL, WHAT DO PEOPLE DO TO
FILL UP THE HOLE IN THEIR LIVES?

38:12.621 --> 38:15.624
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,
NO MATTER WHO I'M WITH, I...

38:15.624 --> 38:17.626
I FEEL ALONE.

38:17.626 --> 38:19.328
YOU'LL FIND SOMETHING,

38:19.328 --> 38:22.331
AND WHEN YOU DO, YOU'LL BE
GLAD YOU HAVE THE ROOM.

38:22.331 --> 38:25.504
LOTS AND LOTS OF ROOM.
(chuckles)

38:25.504 --> 38:29.778
THANKS. MM.
I'M SO GLAD I STOPPED BY.

38:31.780 --> 38:33.782
HEY.

38:33.782 --> 38:36.745
WE'RE ABOUT TO EAT.
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US?

38:36.745 --> 38:38.647
OKAY.

38:38.647 --> 38:40.619
OKAY.

38:40.619 --> 38:44.453
BUT KEEP THE BABY
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE TABLE.

38:44.453 --> 38:47.556
WHAT? I'LL PROBABLY LET HER
PLAY WITH MY KNIFE.

38:47.556 --> 38:49.658
(chuckles)

38:49.658 --> 38:52.661
(birds chirping)

38:54.733 --> 38:58.507
(thud)
 OW! SON OF A BITCH!

38:58.507 --> 39:01.610
(grunting)

39:03.512 --> 39:05.544
LET ME LOOK AT IT.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.045
NO.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.448
YOU OKAY?

39:09.448 --> 39:11.620
(sighs)

39:11.620 --> 39:12.851
MIKE, ARE YOU OKAY?

39:12.851 --> 39:16.455
NO, I'M NOT OKAY.
WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE COME HERE.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.757
INSTEAD OF WAITING
FOR OUR REAL ANNIVERSARY,

39:18.757 --> 39:21.890
WE WASTED OUR TIME
ON THIS DISASTER.

39:21.890 --> 39:24.593
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE
YELLING AT ME? 'CAUSE I...

39:24.593 --> 39:27.566
'CAUSE I MOVED UP
OUR ANNIVERSARY?

39:27.566 --> 39:29.568
BECAUSE YOU'RE DYING.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.901
YOU'RE DYING,

39:32.901 --> 39:36.074
AND THERE'S NOT A DAMN THING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

39:36.074 --> 39:38.076
LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT IT...

39:38.076 --> 39:41.650
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE GETTING
READY TO SAY GOOD-BYE...

39:41.650 --> 39:43.812
LIKE YOU'RE BAILING ON ME.

39:43.812 --> 39:45.514
BAILING?

39:45.514 --> 39:46.815
(sighs)

39:46.815 --> 39:48.757
I AM FIGHTING.

39:50.759 --> 39:53.462
I-I AM SCARED, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

39:53.462 --> 39:55.864
BUT I AM FIGHTING MY ASS OFF.

39:55.864 --> 39:57.496
(sighs)

39:57.496 --> 39:59.968
I WANT TO SEE M.J. GRADUATE.

40:01.700 --> 40:05.434
I WANT TO GROW OLD WITH YOU.

40:07.736 --> 40:09.738
I WANT ALL OF THAT.

40:11.740 --> 40:14.082
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, I...

40:16.084 --> 40:18.587
I AM GONNA ENJOY EVERY...

40:18.587 --> 40:21.149
EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY DAY.

40:24.192 --> 40:25.694
MM.

40:28.597 --> 40:29.898
(sighs)

40:32.100 --> 40:33.602
(sighs)

40:33.602 --> 40:35.163
(exhales deeply)

40:36.835 --> 40:38.837
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

40:38.837 --> 40:41.069
OW.

40:41.069 --> 40:44.072
HEY. LEAN ON ME.

40:44.072 --> 40:46.575
I'M A LOT STRONGER
THAN YOU THINK.

40:50.479 --> 40:54.152
OUR LIVES ARE BRIEF.

40:54.152 --> 40:58.056
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
TO SEARCH FOR MEANING.

41:00.128 --> 41:03.932
WE FIND IT
IN OUR DAUGHTER'S SMILE...

41:03.932 --> 41:08.767
IN THE WARMTH
OF OUR FRIENDS...

41:08.767 --> 41:14.002
OR THE COMFORT OF OUR FAITH.

41:14.002 --> 41:16.705
(man) OKAY, COMING THROUGH.

41:16.705 --> 41:20.478
THEN THERE ARE THOSE WHO MAKE
THEIR LIVES MEANINGFUL

41:20.478 --> 41:23.612
BY MAKING A GREAT SACRIFICE.

41:23.612 --> 41:27.916
HELLO. MY NAME IS BETH YOUNG.
I'M HERE TO DONATE A KIDNEY.

41:27.916 --> 41:30.919
I JUST FOUND OUT I'M A MATCH
FOR A FRIEND OF MINE.

41:30.919 --> 41:33.622
(sighs) I'M SORRY, MA'AM.
YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE.

41:33.622 --> 41:36.024
YOU WANT THE TRANSPLANT OFFICE
ON THE FOURTH FLOOR.

41:36.024 --> 41:38.026
THESE ARE MY FORMS.

41:38.026 --> 41:40.929
I THINK YOU'LL SEE THEY'RE
ALL COMPLETELY FILLED OUT.

41:40.929 --> 41:43.632
AGAIN, MA'AM, YOU WANT
THE TRANSPLANT OFFICE.

41:43.632 --> 41:45.574
THIS IS EMERGENCY.

41:45.574 --> 41:47.576
MY FRIEND'S NAME
IS SUSAN DELFINO.

41:47.576 --> 41:50.609
(telephone ringing)
 IT'S FUNNY. AT FIRST,
WE DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL.

41:50.609 --> 41:53.211
ACTUALLY, WE NEVER GOT ALONG.

41:53.211 --> 41:55.914
BUT THAT KIND OF THING
SEEMS SO INSIGNIFICANT

41:55.914 --> 41:58.046
WHEN SOMEONE IS IN NEED.

41:58.046 --> 42:01.950
THAT'S GREAT. FOURTH FLOOR,
ELEVATOR'S DOWN THE HALL.

42:04.723 --> 42:07.025
I REALLY DON'T MEAN
TO TROUBLE YOU,

42:07.025 --> 42:10.759
BUT THESE FORMS HAVE TO
GET TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

42:10.759 --> 42:13.261
I DON'T WANT TO
MESS THIS UP.

42:13.261 --> 42:17.035
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

42:17.035 --> 42:19.267
OKAY.

42:19.267 --> 42:21.710
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

42:21.710 --> 42:24.643
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE VERY KIND.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.645
(man)
WHEELCHAIR IS ON ITS WAY.

42:26.645 --> 42:29.648
(indistinct conversations)

42:36.855 --> 42:38.126
(gunshot)

42:38.126 --> 42:40.629
(thud, woman screams)

42:40.629 --> 42:42.631
WE NEED SOME HELP OVER HERE!

42:42.631 --> 42:45.634
(indistinct shouting)
