00:07.549 --> 00:08.800

-Handsome. Hip.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.969
He has fingers
like puffy little clouds.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.888

just the right amount of swing.

00:18.477 --> 00:19.895

00:19.895 --> 00:21.438
I am planning
on not pressuring AJ.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.940
Yeah, man, we got
to keep her focused.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.275
Hey, Davvy has an amazing
hair stylist, Paolo,

00:25.275 --> 00:26.860
who she says
is really one of a kind.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.612
He is cheap,
because he's just starting out,

00:28.612 --> 00:30.530
and here's the kicker:
he's straight.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.324
Oh.
Straight hairdresser.

00:32.324 --> 00:33.825
Nothing sexier.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.286
Hot guy running his hands
through your hair.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.330
Oh!
Better than Xanax.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.790
We're gonna have
Xanax there, right?

00:39.790 --> 00:41.542

00:41.542 --> 00:42.501

You want one?

00:42.501 --> 00:43.961
Yeah, give me half.

00:43.961 --> 00:46.088
You know, Flash was
a straight hairdresser once.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.256
all: What?

00:47.256 --> 00:49.091
That's right,
1980, right?

00:49.091 --> 00:51.134
Yeah, my mom worked
in this salon.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.844
Got me a job when I was 15.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.137
Sweeping up haircuts.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.931
Taught me how to do
blow-dries and stuff.

00:55.931 --> 00:58.809
I was, like, a little 5'2"
rock star in this joint.

00:58.809 --> 01:02.020

01:40.392 --> 01:43.186
This is why I was meant
to not have kids.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.522
So I could blossom in my 40s
and only worry about my career.

two kids at home right now?

-Ooh.
-Three if you count Johnny.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.902

Where's the help?

01:50.902 --> 01:52.029

01:52.029 --> 01:53.864
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.115
I do.
I want to have kids.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.658
I want to have
more than one too.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.827
I was an only child.
I always wanted a sibling.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.704
-This is thought out.
-Yeah, it's very thought out.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.039
I want to have a boy and a girl.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.582
What if you get famous?

02:03.582 --> 02:05.375
If I get famous,
then I guess I'll have to pull

02:05.375 --> 02:07.085
an Angelina Jolie and adopt,
like, seven kids

02:07.085 --> 02:08.337
from seven different continents.

02:08.337 --> 02:09.338
For that to work,
one of them

02:09.338 --> 02:10.547
would have to be a penguin.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.049
That's okay,
I love penguins.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.967
And I can name each of them
after a day of the week

02:13.967 --> 02:15.802
or a member of Arcade Fire.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.888
Honey, just please
let me come to rehearsal.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.097
I'm dying to see

02:19.097 --> 02:20.182
No.

02:20.182 --> 02:21.224

Pretty please?

02:21.224 --> 02:23.060
-Come on.
-(sighs)

02:23.060 --> 02:24.394
Fine,
but you have to promise

02:24.394 --> 02:26.021
to be nothing
but supportive to her.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.357
Honey, I'm gonna be totally

02:28.357 --> 02:29.650

-All right.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.777
See, we make a great team.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.111
A good father-daughter team.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.656

I'm cool.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.922

-Sorry, Ronnie.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.493

Ava X's boyfriend.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.713

03:33.713 --> 03:35.257
She could get
some play out of this.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.050
Very tight.
Very sexy.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.510
Yeah, well,
let me tell you something.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.637
She gets some play
out of this in the press,

03:40.637 --> 03:42.139
I'm gonna get some play too,
because a lot of those

03:42.139 --> 03:43.890

03:43.890 --> 03:46.351
Listen, kid, you might as well
face the facts.

The only way
you're getting famous

03:47.936 --> 03:51.481
at this point in your life
is if you kill someone famous.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.067

thoughts on that,

05:03.345 --> 05:05.013
but basically, the reason
you missed those two notes

05:05.013 --> 05:06.681
is because you didn't breathe
before the middle eight.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.183
You got to sell and breathe.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.935
You're already selling it,
so just breathe, okay?

05:09.935 --> 05:11.645
Especially if you're
gonna do that phrasing.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.979

07:27.697 --> 07:29.032
At. Me. Love it.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.867
Okay, let's change hair
and makeup.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.161
Whoa!

07:33.161 --> 07:35.205
-Wow!
-Bam Bam!

07:35.205 --> 07:36.665
-Look at you.
-Where'd you get that outfit?

07:36.665 --> 07:38.208
Campbell bought it for me.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.335
Oh, and he also wanted me
to give you this

07:40.335 --> 07:42.337
when I mentioned
your cabaret debut.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.005
Aww,
that's so sweet of him.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.549
BAM BAM: He really is
the nicest person, you know?

07:46.549 --> 07:48.343
Just caring.

07:48.343 --> 07:51.179
I mean, he's a scary,
wild, beast of a man,

07:51.179 --> 07:54.015
but underneath that surface,
he's just, you know,

07:54.015 --> 07:57.310
gentle, and spiritual,
and collaborative.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.687
Tell him we said thank you
for the chocolates.

07:58.687 --> 07:59.729
-Yeah.
-You got it, Johnny.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.564
Enjoy those.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.025
Did you also collaborate
with an eye doctor?

08:04.025 --> 08:05.944
Oh, these.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.779
No, they're a gift
from the man himself,

08:07.779 --> 08:09.197
along with this scarf.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.825
Campbell says
the various accoutrements

08:11.825 --> 08:14.327
give me a dash of theatrical
authority, you know?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.705
-Okay.
-More like a dash of Dame Edna.

08:16.705 --> 08:17.706
Excuse me?

08:17.706 --> 08:18.873
I like the new look, man.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.500
I think you look great.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.585
Thanks.
Goes with my new title.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.129
-What new title?
-What's your new title?

08:24.129 --> 08:26.172
My new official
show credit is...

08:26.172 --> 08:29.092
"Percussion
Designed and Composed By."

08:29.092 --> 08:30.343
-Whoa!
-Wow, man!

08:30.343 --> 08:32.262
Stop! it! Bam Bam!
-That's awesome!

08:32.262 --> 08:33.596
I'm gonna--we have to up your
deal.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.764
I'm gonna call Spencer
right now,

08:34.764 --> 08:35.974
and we're gonna up your deal.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.101
I like that.
I like the sounds of that.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.769
"Up the deal."

08:39.769 --> 08:41.521
What are you looking at,
Ansel Adams?

08:41.521 --> 08:43.732
(chuckles)

08:43.732 --> 08:45.066
Oh, sorry.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.777
<i>♪ Nothing comes along ♪</i>

08:47.777 --> 08:49.320
(engine revving)

08:49.320 --> 08:51.406
Do I look okay?
I didn't know what to wear.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.283
It's very hard to pick out
something to wear

08:53.283 --> 08:54.617
to a New Jersey lunch
with Lady Gaga

08:54.617 --> 08:56.286
that doesn't look
like a punch line

08:56.286 --> 08:57.620
about what you're
supposed to wear

08:57.620 --> 08:59.080
to a New Jersey lunch
with Lady Gaga.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.498
You look great.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.750
She's getting married soon,
you know?

09:01.750 --> 09:03.543
Well, she should.
She's old.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.919
Yeah, she's 30.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.088
Yeah, which, for you,
she might as well be 45.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.549
(gasps) Do you think we'll get
invited to the wedding?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.093
Oh, my God.
What would I wear to that?

09:12.093 --> 09:14.137
Okay,
I'm getting ahead of myself.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.389
Jesus, Gigi, you haven't
even met the woman yet.

09:16.389 --> 09:20.268
God.
When is the wedding?

09:20.268 --> 09:21.644
She probably doesn't
want you to say.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.688
That's okay.
Respect her wishes.

09:28.318 --> 09:31.488
(rock music)

09:31.488 --> 09:32.697
Listen.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.241
Hey,
just come back to the show.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.702
We're working on some
really great music,

09:37.702 --> 09:39.913
but we need a couple more songs,
and...

09:39.913 --> 09:42.207
I'd really love your input.

09:42.207 --> 09:45.043
Bam, do you know what
my new title is around here?

09:45.043 --> 09:47.629
"Long-Suffering Genius That
Can't Get Out of His Own Way"?

09:47.629 --> 09:49.339
Nope.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.049
"Boss Photographer."

09:51.049 --> 09:52.717
What I see, I shoot.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.594
What I shoot, I print.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.970
No collaboration.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.848
No artistic interference.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.725
Hey, Bam,
if you're looking for somebody

10:00.725 --> 10:02.602
to write some music
with Campbell Scott,

10:02.602 --> 10:04.437
I would love to have
some of that respectability

10:04.437 --> 10:07.190
rub off on me.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.567
-Johnny.
-Yeah?

10:09.567 --> 10:11.736
If you decide to contribute
music to this project,

10:11.736 --> 10:15.573
which is a rape
of my original vision,

10:15.573 --> 10:17.951
it <i>will</i> be the end
of our friendship.

10:17.951 --> 10:22.163
Okay, but I think you're
forgetting one important thing.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.706
What?

10:23.706 --> 10:25.708
We're not friends.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.592
He's right.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.761
It'll be the end
of <i>our</i> friendship.

10:36.761 --> 10:40.765
-Seriously?
-Dead seriously.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.308
Gaga comes from
a two-kid family.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.434
Oh, no, I know.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.353
Her sister, Natali,
is very cool.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.730
She told me she wants to have
three kids, at least.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.566
Dude,
if I was banging Taylor Kinney,

10:49.566 --> 10:51.776
I would have three kids
right in a row,

10:51.776 --> 10:53.403
and then I would wait
till they were teenagers

10:53.403 --> 10:55.655
and retire and just live off
the mega-cash they'd make

10:55.655 --> 10:57.574
from their modeling careers.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.742
You and me would have
pretty good-looking kids.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.328
Aw, we would.
We'd have really cute kids.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.623
They'd be blue-eyed,
really tall, really talented,

11:05.623 --> 11:08.960
and really sarcastic musicians.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.129
♪ Dig, dig, dig ♪

11:11.129 --> 11:13.381
♪ Baby, your secret's
in the safe ♪

11:13.381 --> 11:15.258
Dude, you should be happy
for me.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.927
For what?
Huh?

11:17.927 --> 11:20.388
For not standing up for me
when I told Campbell Scott

11:20.388 --> 11:22.515
that he wasn't gonna be able
to ruin my idea?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.809
This is not
trivial to me, man.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.312
I don't care how many titles
they bestow upon

11:27.312 --> 11:31.691
your "Pitbull with pituitary
gland problem" visage!

11:31.691 --> 11:33.109
I conceived of "An Gorta Mor."

11:33.109 --> 11:34.694
I brought you
into "An Gorta Mor."

11:34.694 --> 11:37.113
I created it.
I composed "An Gorta Mor."

11:37.113 --> 11:39.699
Those are the only two titles
that really matter anyway:

11:39.699 --> 11:43.369
"Created and Composed by Moi!"

11:43.369 --> 11:46.956
Well, I'm not working on
a show called "An Gorta Mor."

11:46.956 --> 11:49.709
I'm working on
a show entitled "Feast."

11:49.709 --> 11:51.586
Starring Campbell Scott.

11:51.586 --> 11:52.837
Amadan.

11:56.257 --> 11:59.010
That's Gaelic for jackass!

11:59.010 --> 12:02.096
Asshole!

12:02.096 --> 12:03.681
I think it looks hot.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.017
Yeah, but it's--like, up here,
it's too much.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.978
I look like a zombie she pimp.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.147
-A hot zombie she pimp.
-No. No, no, no.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.649
We need--
the eyes and the lips.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.442
-We got to bring them down.
-We got to--guys,

12:14.442 --> 12:15.652
-we got to--
-No.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.986
Bring it down.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.404
Bringing it down.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.616
(car door shuts)

12:22.617 --> 12:25.453
This is it.
(sighs)

12:25.453 --> 12:27.080
I'm really nervous.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.456
Does my make up
look okay?

12:28.456 --> 12:30.041
I feel like a kabuki dancer,
no?

12:30.041 --> 12:31.501
No, you look good.
You're acting nuts.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.836
I know.
Okay, I've just got to breathe.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.004
All right, so what do we do?

12:35.004 --> 12:36.381
We just walk to the house
from here?

12:36.381 --> 12:38.216
Is there a car
that comes and picks us up?

12:38.216 --> 12:39.259
Is it a limo?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.552
It's probably a limo, right?

12:41.552 --> 12:43.554
Is it a limo?

12:43.554 --> 12:44.555
What?

12:44.555 --> 12:46.557
What's that look?

12:46.557 --> 12:50.228
You know, I bought three things
with my Gaga tour cash

12:50.228 --> 12:52.730
and session bread--
all the other money

12:52.730 --> 12:55.441
that I made over the years;

12:55.441 --> 12:57.318
that sweet little hellcat,

12:57.318 --> 13:00.321
some cool guitars,

13:00.321 --> 13:01.531
and this.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.451
Wait, what?

13:05.451 --> 13:08.037
Nine acres.
Bought it four years ago.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.706
Paid in full.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.125
It's all mine.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.669
Or should I say,
it's all ours?

13:14.669 --> 13:17.046
Oh, my God.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.631
Are you asking me
to marry you?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.508
I guess I am.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.637
-Gigi, would you--
-Oh, God, no.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.015
God--no, no, no.
No, no, no.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.975
What are you doing?
What are you doing? No!

13:28.975 --> 13:30.518
What?
Are you out of your mind?

13:30.518 --> 13:31.853
-Well, I thought you just--
-You thought what?

13:31.853 --> 13:34.063
You thought I wanted
to get married?

13:34.063 --> 13:36.524
Well, not married.
This is all spur-of-the-moment.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.734
I didn't buy a ring or anything,

13:37.734 --> 13:39.610
but...
commitment.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.779
Commitment to what?
I'm freaking out here.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.114
You have to tell me
what's going on.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.657
Gigi, I want to have
kids with you.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.200
Who said
I wanted to have kids?

13:46.200 --> 13:47.535
-You did.
-When?

13:47.535 --> 13:48.870
Yesterday at the cafe.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.122
Driving here.
Tall, sarcastic kids.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.207
Flash, I say stupid shit
like that all the time.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.625
I'm 22 goddamn years old.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.085
Do you remember a month ago
when I told you

13:56.085 --> 13:57.503
I wanted to move to Miami?

13:57.503 --> 13:58.963
Do you remember my
"cupcake cabin in Alaska" idea?

13:58.963 --> 14:00.631
Yeah, I do.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.008
I'm passionate about
a million different things.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.342
I'm passionate
about Syrian refugees.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.343
I'm passionate
about Demi Lovato.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.803
These--these shoes.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.306
This trip is gonna ruin
these shoes for me now.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.808
Okay, look, number one,
cupcake cabin's a good idea.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.143
-Thank you.
-Number two,

14:12.143 --> 14:13.644
you don't
want to have kids ever?

14:13.644 --> 14:15.521
I don't know.
I don't know, maybe.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.858
But not now.
Not while I still am a kid.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.359
God, I'll tell you
one thing, though.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.778
No matter what happens,
I'm not raising them

14:21.778 --> 14:23.196
in the Middle of
Goddamn Nowhere, New Jersey.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.114
This is what
I ran away from in Ohio.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.365
What about the Stones pin?

14:26.365 --> 14:27.950
What?
What about it?

14:27.950 --> 14:30.369
Come on, the whole thing's
goddamn rubies.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.580
I googled rubies.
Rubies means commitment.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.874
-You googled rubies?
-You bet your ass.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.460
Flash, the pin is lips.
It was a joke.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.087
An intimate joke about
our kissing thing.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.379
-Oh.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.965
It's a really (...)
expensive one too.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.217
(sighs)
(...).

14:46.886 --> 14:49.055
Flash.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.973
Get the (...) up!

14:50.973 --> 14:52.308
Now!

14:52.308 --> 14:53.518
Come on, man.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.108
(blows raspberries)

15:00.108 --> 15:02.068
(door handle jiggling)

15:07.365 --> 15:08.991
(sighs)

15:18.167 --> 15:19.794
Okay, go ahead
and announce me.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.212
-You ready?
-Yeah. Yeah.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.380
Okay, here I go.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.881
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:23.881 --> 15:25.174
please welcome to the stage,

15:25.174 --> 15:27.718
making her New York City
cabaret debut,

15:27.718 --> 15:30.721
the fabulous Ava X!

15:32.890 --> 15:34.225
Huh?

15:34.225 --> 15:36.644
(chuckles)
What do you think?

15:36.644 --> 15:39.564
I mean, this is gonna get
the audience's attention, right?

15:39.564 --> 15:41.107
And Debbie Harry,
she sure as hell

15:41.107 --> 15:42.567
ain't wearing this
on her opening night.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.360
-No. No.
-That's for damn sure.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.279
(laughs)

15:46.279 --> 15:47.947
Oh, yeah.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.161
-You hate it.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.538
I-I think it's, uh...

15:55.538 --> 15:57.373
-ballsy, you know?
-Really?

15:57.373 --> 15:59.292
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's like a--it's a statement.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.335
Right?
Yeah.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.171
So you're cool
with me making my debut

16:03.171 --> 16:06.007
looking like a meth head,
Oklahoma stripper?

16:06.007 --> 16:07.592
-What do you mean?
-Huh?

16:07.592 --> 16:09.302
Do you think I'm insane?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.679
I wouldn't go out like this
when I was 25 years old,

16:11.679 --> 16:13.139
-much less now.
-Well...

16:13.139 --> 16:15.349
So let's cut the crap

16:15.349 --> 16:16.934
and why don't you tell me
what's really going on

16:16.934 --> 16:19.020
because for the past 48 hours,
you have been feeding me

16:19.020 --> 16:22.106
sugar-coated,
over supportive bullshit.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.733
-That's not true, honey.
-Oh, it is true.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.484
It's not true.
-Okay, all that noise about AJ?

16:25.484 --> 16:27.737
-How great his playing is.
-I think he's a--

16:27.737 --> 16:28.905
My voice.
My moves.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.239
-Blah, blah, blah--
-Okay.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.241
-Okay.
-Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.540
Okay, you want--you want me--
do you want me

16:39.540 --> 16:40.666
-to tell you the truth?
-Yeah, I do.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.001
Okay, here's what I think.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.836
I do think that
your voice sounds great

16:43.836 --> 16:46.964
and I like your stage moves.
I'm not crazy about this dress.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.466
Is AJ a great piano player?
Yes, he is, but you know what?

16:48.466 --> 16:49.800
I want you to get rid of him,

16:49.800 --> 16:51.344
and I want you
to give me a shot, okay?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.387
Everybody in this band
has something going on.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.805
Bam has that "Feast" thing,

16:54.805 --> 16:56.307
and--and Rehab has
his photography thing,

16:56.307 --> 16:57.892
and the Gibson ads for Flash,

16:57.892 --> 16:59.894
and Gigi's, you know,
doing stuff with Davvy,

16:59.894 --> 17:01.520
and you got this thing,
and what am I supposed to do?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.356
Hang around the apartment
while you guys climb up

17:03.356 --> 17:05.524
the show business ladder?
(stammers) I can't do that.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.776
-Okay, wait, wait, wait.
-What?

17:06.776 --> 17:08.945
Two weeks ago,
you didn't even want me

17:08.945 --> 17:10.279
-putting this gig together...
-That's not true.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.822
But now--
No, no, no, no. No.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.950
Now that you actually see
that it might be good,

17:13.950 --> 17:15.284
now you want to jump in.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.453
Now you want to be a part of it,
is that right?

17:17.453 --> 17:19.205
Yeah, well, you know what?
It is right.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.915
And let me tell you why,
because when I first met you,

17:20.915 --> 17:22.625
I was the one who told you
you could sing,

17:22.625 --> 17:24.126
and you said you wanted
to be in show business.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.169
I put you in my band.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.462
I put you on my (...) stage.

17:26.462 --> 17:29.340
Okay, so you (...) owe me.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.676
I'm not gonna (...) sit
around here and do nothing.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.304
I was supposed to be the star.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.977
What?

17:40.977 --> 17:43.980
You were the star, Johnny,

17:43.980 --> 17:46.023
but now,

17:46.023 --> 17:49.819
it's my (...) turn.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.070
