WEBVTT

00:05.570 --> 00:06.832
CLAUDIA?

00:06.832 --> 00:08.921
[GASPS] GRIFFIN.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.532
YOU SCARED ME
TO DEATH.

00:10.532 --> 00:11.707
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

00:11.707 --> 00:13.578
HOW COME YOU'RE
NOT AT SCHOOL?

00:13.578 --> 00:17.278
IT'S 4:00.
YOU NEVER CALLED

00:17.278 --> 00:19.541
TO TELL ME WHERE YOU
WERE STAYING,

00:19.541 --> 00:22.761
AND I KNOW I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO VISIT
YOU AT WORK, BUT...

00:22.761 --> 00:24.807
HERE. I BROUGHT
YOU YOUR MAIL--

00:24.807 --> 00:26.678
MAGAZINES MOSTLY.

00:26.678 --> 00:28.680
YOU CAME ALL THE WAY
DOWN HERE

00:28.680 --> 00:31.379
TO BRING ME THE
"WOMEN IN THONGS" ISSUE
OF MOTOR MANIA?

00:31.379 --> 00:35.383
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT...

00:35.383 --> 00:38.038
YOU WERE RIGHT.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.735
NO ONE BOTHERED
TO TELL YOU, BUT...

00:39.735 --> 00:41.302
RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?

00:41.302 --> 00:43.608
MY BOSS IS GONNA
BE BACK ANY SECOND.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.001
ABOUT JULIA.

00:47.308 --> 00:50.006
MAGGIE TOLD CHARLIE
THAT NED USED TO
BEAT HER UP, TOO,

00:50.006 --> 00:53.314
SO BAILEY AND CHARLIE
WENT DOWN THERE TO TRY
AND BRING JULIA HOME,

00:53.314 --> 00:56.491
BUT SHE KICKED THEM OUT,
AND NOW SHE'S NOT
TALKING TO US.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.797
SHE'S NOT TALKING TO ANYONE
ANYMORE, GRIFFIN.

00:58.797 --> 01:01.017
EXCEPT NED.

01:01.017 --> 01:03.237
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T WANNA
KNOW THIS.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.413
WHAT GOOD
IS ME KNOWING
THIS, HUH?

01:05.413 --> 01:07.458
SHE'S NOT GONNA
LISTEN TO ME,
EITHER.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.069
BECAUSE WE HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING.

01:09.069 --> 01:13.073
DO WHAT?
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING
I KNOW HOW TO DO,

01:13.073 --> 01:16.206
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S ONLY MADE
THINGS WORSE.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.860
SORRY.
I GOTTA GET BACK.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.951
SO, THAT'S IT?

01:21.951 --> 01:23.996
YOU'RE JUST GONNA STAY HERE

01:23.996 --> 01:26.173
AND WORK ON YOUR STUPID CARS
AND DO NOTHING?

01:28.436 --> 01:30.655
SHAME ON YOU 'CAUSE...

01:30.655 --> 01:33.528
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S
DOING TO HER NOW, GRIFFIN.

01:33.528 --> 01:36.574
RIGHT NOW--EVERY SECOND
THAT I WASTE EVEN
TALKING TO YOU. I...

01:36.574 --> 01:37.575
CLAUDIA, CALM DOWN.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.621
DON'T TOUCH ME!

01:39.621 --> 01:41.101
AND DON'T TELL ME
TO CALM DOWN,

01:41.101 --> 01:42.841
AND DON'T TELL ME
NO ONE CAN DO
ANYTHING.

01:42.841 --> 01:46.454
THE ONLY PERSON
THAT CAN HELP JULIA
NOW IS JULIA.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.108
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

01:50.806 --> 01:53.243
SHE'S GOTTA MAKE UP
HER OWN MIND THAT THIS
IS GONNA STOP...

01:53.243 --> 01:55.724
OR ELSE...

01:55.724 --> 01:56.942
OR ELSE WHAT?

01:58.988 --> 02:00.859
HE JUST KEEPS
HITTING HER?

02:00.859 --> 02:03.035
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING?

02:20.662 --> 02:22.403

02:46.644 --> 02:48.255
YOU WANT ME TO ASK A JUDGE

02:48.255 --> 02:49.908
TO TAKE A CHILD FROM
A PERFECTLY GOOD HOME.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.301
IT'S A GOOD HOME,
MR. COLE.

02:51.301 --> 02:52.563
MAYBE NOT
THE BEST HOME.

02:52.563 --> 02:54.826
IF CHARLIE
WERE ABUSING OWEN

02:54.826 --> 02:56.828
OR ENDANGERING HIM
IN ANY WAY--

02:56.828 --> 02:58.352
NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

02:58.352 --> 02:59.614
LIKE I SAID,

02:59.614 --> 03:01.790
OWEN HAS
A LEARNING
DISABILITY

03:01.790 --> 03:05.010
THAT CHARLIE REALLY
NEEDS TO BE WORKING
ON, AND HE ISN'T.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.708
IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO
HAVE OWEN TAKEN AWAY
FROM YOUR BROTHER

03:06.708 --> 03:08.884
BASED SOLELY ON THAT...

03:08.884 --> 03:11.278
LOOK, I CAN GIVE
OWEN WHAT HE NEEDS
RIGHT NOW.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.105
I'D BE
THE BETTER GUARDIAN.

03:13.105 --> 03:14.585
OK. WELL, IN THAT CASE,

03:14.585 --> 03:17.240
THE COURT IS GONNA WANT
TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOU,

03:17.240 --> 03:19.590
AND MAYBE IN WAYS YOU
DON'T WANNA BE LOOKED AT.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.026
YOU EVER HAVE A PROBLEM,

03:21.026 --> 03:22.289
SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT COME UP?

03:22.289 --> 03:23.942
A PROBLEM?

03:23.942 --> 03:26.075
EXTREME CASE:
WERE YOU EVER ARRESTED?

03:26.075 --> 03:27.685
ARRESTED? NO.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.514
WAIT.

03:30.514 --> 03:34.257
LET ME REVISE THAT.
I WAS...

03:34.257 --> 03:36.738
I HAD A D.U.I...

03:36.738 --> 03:39.001
AND THE CHARGES
GOT REDUCED.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.872
NOT THAT
ANY OF THAT
MATTERS NOW.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.309
IT'S GONNA MATTER
TO THE COURT.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.354
I'M SOBER NOW.
I'M IN RECOVERY.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.878
YOU'RE ASKING A JUDGE
TO TAKE YOUR LITTLE BROTHER

03:46.878 --> 03:48.793
OUT OF A SOBER,
HARD-WORKING HOME

03:48.793 --> 03:51.579
AND PLACE HIM WITH
AN ALCOHOLIC SINGLE
WITH A RECORD.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.798
SINGLE? NO.
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
WHO LIVES WITH ME--

03:53.798 --> 03:56.975
OH. MAKE THAT AN
ALCOHOLIC SHACKING UP
WITH A YOUNG GIRL.

03:56.975 --> 04:01.893
THE COURT WILL THINK YOU'RE
A TERRIFIC ROLE MODEL
FOR A 5-YEAR-OLD.

04:04.287 --> 04:05.636
TALK TO HIM, BAILEY.

04:05.636 --> 04:08.204
TALK TO YOUR BROTHER.

04:08.204 --> 04:11.033
I HAVE TALKED TO HIM.
I'VE TRIED.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.253
WELL, TRY HARDER.
GET HIM TO CHANGE
HIS MIND.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.863
"TRY HARDER."

04:14.863 --> 04:16.691
THAT'S YOUR
LEGAL ADVICE?

04:16.691 --> 04:20.303
EVERY TIME. BELIEVE ME,
ANYTHING'S BETTER

04:20.303 --> 04:22.523
THAN DRAGGING YOUR FAMILY
THROUGH THE COURT.

04:33.098 --> 04:34.099
HEY.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.275
HEY.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.928
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

04:36.928 --> 04:39.104
TO BE LATE...
OBVIOUSLY.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.323
LATE FOR WHAT?

04:40.323 --> 04:42.107
I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.327
WE HAVE THAT
SURREALIST WOMEN'S EXHIBIT
AT S.F. MOMA.

04:44.327 --> 04:45.328
WE?

04:45.328 --> 04:46.808
YEAH,
ME AND MAGGIE.

04:51.116 --> 04:53.945
SO, WHAT, YOU TWO
ARE GONNA GET TOGETHER

04:53.945 --> 04:55.338
AND COMPARE NOTES
ON ME NOW?

04:55.338 --> 04:57.906
NO. IT'S FOR CLASS.
WE PLANNED IT MONTHS AGO.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.603
'CAUSE I CAN JUST
IMAGINE MAGGIE'S
TWISTED TAKE

04:59.603 --> 05:02.737
ON THE WHOLE THING.

05:02.737 --> 05:05.043
NED, WHATEVER HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND MAGGIE,

05:05.043 --> 05:08.046
I'M NOT...
MAGGIE, OK?

05:08.046 --> 05:10.440
I UNDERSTAND WHAT
THIS IS WITH US...

05:10.440 --> 05:12.137
AND I CAN HANDLE IT.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.878
BY SPENDING THE DAY
WITH MAGGIE?

05:13.878 --> 05:15.358
NED, PLEASE.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.273
NO. I THOUGHT
WE AGREED.

05:17.273 --> 05:20.798
I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST GONNA BE US
NOW--NOBODY ELSE.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.409
NED, DO YOU
HONESTLY THINK

05:22.409 --> 05:24.628
THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT MAGGIE OR ANYONE
COULD SAY TO ME

05:24.628 --> 05:26.456
TO CHANGE THE WAY
I FEEL ABOUT YOU?

05:26.456 --> 05:30.678
HUH? 'CAUSE I'LL TELL YOU,
I'VE HEARD IT ALL...

05:30.678 --> 05:34.943
FROM EVERYONE.
I'VE HEARD THE WORST,
AND I'M STILL HERE.

05:34.943 --> 05:38.512
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

05:38.512 --> 05:41.123
EXCEPT TO THE MUSEUM,
AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.431
PROMISE?

05:44.431 --> 05:46.084
I PROMISE.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.349
I PROMISE.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.357
I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO VOTE.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.141
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO VOTE, CLAUD,

05:59.141 --> 06:01.796
I'M ASKING YOU TO AGREE,
LIKE AS A FAMILY,

06:01.796 --> 06:03.145
WHAT'S BEST FOR OWE.

06:03.145 --> 06:05.147
CHARLIE HAS BEEN
A GOOD FATHER FOR OWEN,

06:05.147 --> 06:06.540
LIKE HE HAS FOR ME AND YOU.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.411
OK, BUT--
BUT OWEN NEEDS MORE.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.847
MORE THAN CHARLIE
CAN GIVE HIM.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.501
SO HELP CHARLIE.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.764
DON'T TRY TO LINE ME
UP AGAINST HIM.

06:13.764 --> 06:15.331
HE WON'T LISTEN
TO ME, CLAUD.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.115
HE'S IN DENIAL THAT OWEN
EVEN HAS A PROBLEM,

06:17.115 --> 06:18.552
WHICH IS WHY I NEED
TO DO SOMETHING.

06:18.552 --> 06:21.119
LIKE WHAT?

06:21.119 --> 06:22.817
WELL, CHARLIE'S
ONLY OWEN'S GUARDIAN.

06:22.817 --> 06:25.080
ONLY HIS GUARDIAN, HUH?

06:27.082 --> 06:28.649
NO, FINISH YOUR PITCH.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.912
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY
TO MY FACE THAT, UH,

06:30.912 --> 06:32.696
THAT I'VE DONE A BAD JOB
AS HEAD OF THIS FAMILY.

06:32.696 --> 06:33.697
NO, THAT'S
NOT EXACTLY--

06:33.697 --> 06:35.482
THIS IS ABOUT OWEN,
CHARLIE.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.787
THIS ISN'T ABOUT US.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
YOU AND ME.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.528
NO? IT IS ABOUT US, BAILEY,

06:38.528 --> 06:40.487
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DEAL
WITH OWEN'S PROBLEM.

06:40.487 --> 06:44.926
SO YOU'RE ADMITTING
THAT HE HAS A PROBLEM?
FINALLY!

06:44.926 --> 06:48.364
YEAH, YEAH. THE WAY
YOU'RE GOING ABOUT OWEN'S
PROBLEM IS A PROBLEM.

06:48.364 --> 06:51.149
IT'S RECKLESS.

06:51.149 --> 06:53.804
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT I'M THE PROBLEM.

06:53.804 --> 06:56.546
I'M THE REASON
THAT OWEN'S ACTING OUT.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.243
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU GUYS.
OWEN IS JUST ACTING OUT
SOMETIMES,

06:58.243 --> 06:59.549
BECAUSE THAT'S OWEN.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.203
HE ACTS OUT. AND WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

07:01.203 --> 07:02.900
IT WASN'T UNTIL DIANA
CAME ALONG THAT HE--

07:06.121 --> 07:08.689
WAIT. CHARLIE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

07:08.689 --> 07:09.777
CLAUD, YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.126
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:11.126 --> 07:13.476
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT,
CHARLIE. EVERYBODY.

07:13.476 --> 07:16.087
LISTEN, I AM STILL
THE LEGAL GUARDIAN,

07:16.087 --> 07:18.046
AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE
ME, TALK TO A LAWYER.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.615
I HAVE TALKED
TO A LAWYER.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.356
YOU WHAT?

07:26.358 --> 07:28.012
BAILEY...

07:28.012 --> 07:31.146
WHAT? FIRST A SOCIAL WORKER
AND NOW A LAWYER?

07:31.146 --> 07:33.627
YOU WANT TO START A LEGAL
THING TO GET OWEN?

07:33.627 --> 07:36.499
ARE YOU NUTS?!

07:36.499 --> 07:39.197
WHY DON'T YOU STEP OUTSIDE
AND GET A LITTLE OXYGEN
TO YOUR BRAIN?

07:39.197 --> 07:41.199
WHAT? YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

07:41.199 --> 07:42.810
YOU TRYING TO THROW ME
OUT OF MY OWN HOUSE?

07:42.810 --> 07:44.855
YOU COME IN HERE WITH PLANS
TO BREAK UP THIS HOUSE,

07:44.855 --> 07:46.814
THEN, YEAH, YOU CAN GO.

07:46.814 --> 07:50.078
AND THAT'S HOW YOU KEEP
THE FAMILY TOGETHER,
HUH? CHARLIE?

07:52.210 --> 07:57.520
YOU SEE, CLAUD? YOU SEE?

07:57.520 --> 08:01.306
IS THIS POOR CAR EVEN GOING
TO MAKE IT TO SAN FRANCISCO?

08:01.306 --> 08:04.179
SHH. COME ON,
THE BUG'S OK.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.746
AND SHE'S WAY BETTER
THAN THE BEAST.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.878
I'M SORRY, LOVE BUG.

08:07.878 --> 08:09.880
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
TO BRAG, BUT...

08:09.880 --> 08:11.099
WHAT?

08:11.099 --> 08:13.014
YOU'RE KIDDING. IN HERE?
IT'S TINY.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.972
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY,

08:14.972 --> 08:16.017
IT'S NOT THE SIZE
OF THE CAR,

08:16.017 --> 08:18.236
IT'S THE FACT THAT
THE SEATS GO BACK.

08:18.236 --> 08:19.542
WAIT. WHERE ARE WE GOING?

08:19.542 --> 08:21.152
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.503
HEY, MY LOVE BUG CANNOT
LIVE ON LOVE ALONE.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.548
MAGS, YOU GOT A FULL TANK
OF GAS.

08:25.548 --> 08:29.160
SHH. THAT OLD GAUGE
ISN'T WHAT IT USED
TO BE.

08:36.037 --> 08:37.473
WANT ANYTHING?

08:37.473 --> 08:38.953
SURPRISE ME.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.050
WOW! THAT WAS FAST.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.617
GRIFFIN!SURPRISE.

08:50.617 --> 08:51.618
WHAT ARE YOU...

08:51.618 --> 08:53.533
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:54.969 --> 08:58.363
GRIFFIN, STOP!
STOP THE CAR.

08:58.363 --> 09:00.148
GRIFFIN, I MEAN IT.
STOP THE CAR RIGHT NOW.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.244
GRIFFIN. GRIFFIN, STOP!

09:09.244 --> 09:11.507
STOP THE CAR.

09:11.507 --> 09:15.424
GRIFFIN, I AM NOT KIDDING.
STOP THE CAR AND TAKE ME
BACK THERE.

09:15.424 --> 09:18.209
GRIFFIN, THIS IS MAGGIE'S CAR.
YOU CAN'T JUST...

09:18.209 --> 09:20.560
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

09:22.692 --> 09:25.216
OH, GREAT. SO--SO WHAT?
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO TALK TO ME NOW?

09:25.216 --> 09:26.870
YOU'RE GOING TO KIDNAP ME
AND NOT TELL ME WHY?

09:26.870 --> 09:29.003
YOU'RE NOT BEING
KIDNAPPED.

09:29.003 --> 09:30.091
EXACTLY.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.353
YES, I AM!

09:31.353 --> 09:33.224
GOD, YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
BEEN STALKING ME.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.965
YOU DRIVE OFF WITH ME
AGAINST MY WILL,

09:34.965 --> 09:36.097
YOU WON'T LET ME
OUT OF THE CAR.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.447
WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU CALL IT?

09:38.447 --> 09:40.275
WE'RE JUST GOING
SOMEPLACE TO TALK,
ALL RIGHT?

09:40.275 --> 09:42.277
[SIGHS]

09:42.277 --> 09:44.148
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAGGIE'S
GONNA CALL THE POLICE.

09:44.148 --> 09:45.149
YOU'RE GOING STRAIGHT
BACK TO JAIL.

09:45.149 --> 09:46.890
MAGGIE'S NOT GOING
TO CALL THE POLICE.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.197
SHE'S GONNA GO CALL
A CAB, AND
SHE'S GONNA GO HOME.

09:49.197 --> 09:50.764
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT
THE PLAN WAS.

09:50.764 --> 09:53.723
WAIT. MAGGIE WAS IN
ON THIS, TOO?

09:53.723 --> 09:55.377
AND CLAUDIA.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.988
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE...

09:57.988 --> 10:00.338
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?

10:00.338 --> 10:02.079
WHY CAN'T YOU ALL
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?

10:02.079 --> 10:04.429
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANY OF YOU.

10:04.429 --> 10:05.822
NO, SAVE IT, ALL RIGHT?

10:05.822 --> 10:07.563
YOU THINK I REALLY WANT
TO BE HERE?

10:07.563 --> 10:10.000
IT'S JUST THAT CLAUDIA
AND MAGGIE ARE SO
CONVINCED THAT,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.088
IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T
DO SOMETHING--

10:11.088 --> 10:12.046
THEN WHAT?

10:17.704 --> 10:18.792
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
NO DIFFERENT THAN
MY SISTER WAS,

10:18.792 --> 10:20.054
YOU KNOW THAT?

10:20.054 --> 10:22.317
SHE NEVER NEEDED
ANY HELP.

10:22.317 --> 10:23.971
HELL, SHE NEVER
HAD ANY PROBLEMS.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.537
SHE COULD HANDLE
THE DRUGS,

10:25.537 --> 10:27.409
SHE COULD HANDLE MY DAD,

10:27.409 --> 10:29.019
UNTIL SHE COULDN'T.

10:33.894 --> 10:36.331
SO WHAT'S THE BIG PLAN?

10:39.508 --> 10:41.292
I THOUGHT MAYBE I TOOK
YOU SOME PLACE THAT
YOU LOVED, YOU KNOW,

10:41.292 --> 10:42.380
SOME PLACE YOU USED
TO BE YOURSELF.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.165
OH, MAYBE IT'S STUPID,

10:44.165 --> 10:47.211
BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOUR PARENTS' CABIN
UP IN TAHOE.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.256
IF I COULD JUST
GET YOU THERE AND--

10:48.256 --> 10:49.605
YEAH, WELL, YOU WERE WRONG.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.043
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

10:53.043 --> 10:54.218
LAKE TAHOE IS THAT WAY.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.880
BAILEY.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.316
DIDN'T THE DOORMAN
CALL UP?

11:05.316 --> 11:06.622
HE SAID
MR. SALINGER,

11:06.622 --> 11:07.928
SO, YOU KNOW...

11:07.928 --> 11:09.233
OH, YOU THOUGHT
CHARLIE.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.278
YEAH. HI.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.888
HI.
COME IN.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.499
I'M--ACTUALLY, I'M...
KIND OF GLAD IT'S YOU.

11:14.499 --> 11:17.285
IT'S LIKE
THE DEPARTURE LOUNGE
DOWNSTAIRS.

11:17.285 --> 11:18.939
OH, YEAH, I KNOW.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.767
SO MANY FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
LIVE IN THIS BUILDING,

11:20.767 --> 11:22.769
THEY CALL IT
THE BIRDCAGE.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.553
IT'S KIND OF...
DIFFERENT FOR ME, HUH?

11:24.553 --> 11:26.511
IT'S A NICE PLACE,
THOUGH.
IT'S A NICE VIEW.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.122
YEAH. I LIKE IT.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.515
IT'S...IT'S TEMPORARY.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.517
IT'S NICE.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.476
SO...

11:34.476 --> 11:36.130
YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT THE VIEW.

11:36.130 --> 11:39.481
NO. I DIDN'T.
ACTUALLY...

11:39.481 --> 11:41.483
KIRSTEN, I CAME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT OWEN.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.528
HE'S BEEN HAVING
SOME PROBLEMS.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.095
IS HE OK?

11:45.095 --> 11:46.967
YES, AND...

11:46.967 --> 11:49.491
AND NOT REALLY.

11:49.491 --> 11:50.666
HE'S BEEN HAVING
A LOT OF TROUBLE
WITH SCHOOL.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.233
HERE.

11:52.233 --> 11:55.192
THESE ARE
LEARNING TESTS,
READING TESTS,

11:55.192 --> 11:56.890
AND HE'S REALLY
BEEN STRUGGLING.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.370
IF YOU ASK CHARLIE,
HE WOULD SAY HE JUST
NEEDS TO FOCUS,

11:59.370 --> 12:00.850
AND THAT EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO WORK
ITSELF OUT.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.678
BAILEY, WAIT, NO.

12:02.678 --> 12:03.984
I'M NOT...

12:03.984 --> 12:05.376
GETTING IN BETWEEN
YOU AND CHARLIE.

12:05.376 --> 12:07.683
OK, WELL,
FORGET ABOUT ME
AND CHARLIE.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.163
THIS IS ABOUT OWEN.
WHAT ABOUT OWEN?

12:09.163 --> 12:11.513
NO. NO. IT STILL...

12:11.513 --> 12:12.557
IT'S...

12:16.213 --> 12:17.606
GETTING INVOLVED
LIKE THAT? I'M SORRY.

12:17.606 --> 12:20.217
IT FEELS LIKE
A STEP BACKWARD FOR ME.

12:20.217 --> 12:22.132
I DIDN'T COME
TO SAN FRANCISCO

12:22.132 --> 12:23.917
TO GET IN THE MIDDLE
OF YOUR LIVES AGAIN.

12:23.917 --> 12:26.310
I CAME BACK
TO FIGURE OUT MY OWN.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.051
OK, WELL,
I HEAR ALL THAT.
SO DON'T GET INVOLVED.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.140
DON'T GET BETWEEN US.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.794
WHERE OWEN WINDS UP
IS BETWEEN CHARLIE
AND I, BUT, KIRSTEN--

12:31.794 --> 12:33.491
WAIT A MINUTE.

12:33.491 --> 12:35.276
YOU ARE SOMEONE
WHO KNOWS A LOT
ABOUT CHILD DEVELOPMENT,

12:35.276 --> 12:37.669
AND I'M TELLING YOU, IF
YOU LOOK AT THESE TESTS...

12:37.669 --> 12:39.280
LOOK AT THEM.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.108
BAILEY,

12:41.108 --> 12:43.110
ARE YOU TRYING
TO TAKE OWEN AWAY
FROM CHARLIE?

12:46.113 --> 12:47.941
OK, YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

12:47.941 --> 12:49.899
I DON'T NEED TO LOOK
AT YOUR TESTS.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.554
I'LL TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW...

12:52.554 --> 12:56.253
IF--IF YOU THINK THAT
TAKING OWEN AWAY
IS THE SOLUTION,

12:56.253 --> 12:57.472
YOU'RE WRONG.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.517
AND IF YOU PLAN ON
FIGHTING OVER THIS,

12:59.517 --> 13:01.389
IT'S GOING TO DO
MORE DAMAGE TO OWEN

13:01.389 --> 13:03.783
THAN ANYTHING
THAT YOU SEE
ON THESE TESTS.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.612
AND THAT'S
WHAT I THINK.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.836
I'M GOING TO LEAVE
THESE WITH YOU, OK?

13:13.836 --> 13:15.490
YOU LOOK AT THEM
IF YOU WANT.

13:15.490 --> 13:16.578
NO, WAIT,
BAILEY, I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T WANT--

13:16.578 --> 13:18.275
JUST...LOOK AT THEM.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.755
YOU'LL AGREE.

13:29.547 --> 13:32.376
SORRY IF I SCARED YOU.

13:32.376 --> 13:33.987
DID I SCARE YOU, BLINKY?

13:33.987 --> 13:36.511
YEAH, YOU DID.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.600
WHAT'S GOING ON?
JULIA DOESN'T LIVE
HERE ANYMORE.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.428
WELL, I, UH...

13:40.428 --> 13:42.082
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

13:42.082 --> 13:43.605
SHE'S AT THE MUSEUM.

13:43.605 --> 13:44.954
DIDN'T SHE TELL YOU THAT?

13:47.739 --> 13:48.653
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WENT TOGETHER.

13:50.307 --> 13:51.961
I FINISHED EARLY.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.398
YOU KNOW JULIA--
DOESN'T KNOW
WHEN TO QUIT.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.312
YEAH.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.881
SO...DID YOU JUST
COME FROM THERE?

14:00.578 --> 14:03.277
UH-HUH.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.235
THEN HOW COME
I JUST SAW YOU
AT THE CAFETERIA,

14:05.235 --> 14:07.542
MAGGIE? YOU WANT
TO TELL ME THAT?

14:10.110 --> 14:12.329
YOU KNOW WHAT, NED?
MAYBE YOU STILL
HAVE THE KEY,

14:12.329 --> 14:14.070
BUT THAT DOES NOT
GIVE YOU THE RIGHT--

14:14.070 --> 14:15.506
WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:17.421 --> 14:20.207
WHERE IS SHE?
WHO'S SHE WITH?

14:20.207 --> 14:21.686
SHE'S AT THE MUSEUM, NED.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.210
JUST CUT THE CRAP.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.560
OK?

14:25.560 --> 14:26.822
DON'T LIE TO ME.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.737
WHAT'S THE MATTER, NED?
YOU SEEM UPSET.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.915
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER
YOU'RE UP TO,

14:32.915 --> 14:35.265
IT'S A WASTE
OF TIME.

14:35.265 --> 14:37.311
'CAUSE JULIA AND ME,
WE'RE DOING GREAT.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.922
IT'S NOT LIKE WHAT
EVERYONE THINKS.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.142
THEN WHY
YOU SO WORRIED?

14:42.142 --> 14:43.665
I'M NOT.

14:43.665 --> 14:44.318
I'M JUST...

14:47.016 --> 14:48.452
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.498
YOU SCARED SHE'S WITH
SOMEONE SHE'LL LISTEN TO?

14:50.498 --> 14:52.326
WHERE IS SHE,
MAGGIE?

14:52.326 --> 14:54.110
YOU SCARED THEY'LL
START TO MAKE SENSE?

14:54.110 --> 14:57.984
JUST TELL ME
WHERE SHE IS.

14:57.984 --> 15:01.726
SHE'S WHERE
SHE BELONGS, OK?

15:01.726 --> 15:02.902
AWAY FROM YOU.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.124
[STRAINING]

15:13.303 --> 15:16.611
IT IS NOT THE ENGINE.
WE'RE OUT OF GAS.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.352
UNH! THE GAUGE
SAYS IT'S FULL.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.093
THE GAUGE IS LYING.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.617
MAGGIE TOLD ME
WHEN WE STOPPED
FOR GAS.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.404
I THOUGHT SHE SAID
SHE WAS GOING TO
FILL IT UP LAST NIGHT.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.887
OH...
WE BETTER GET GOING

15:31.887 --> 15:33.106
BEFORE IT GETS TOO DARK.

15:33.106 --> 15:36.457
OK, WE ARE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.459
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M WALKING 10 MILES

15:38.459 --> 15:40.548
TO THE NEAREST
REST STOP
IN THESE SHOES

15:40.548 --> 15:41.853
WHICH ARE NEW
AND INCREDIBLY
UNCOMFORTABLE

15:41.853 --> 15:42.942
JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE TOO MALE
TO SIT HERE

15:42.942 --> 15:45.118
AND WAIT FOR HELP.

15:45.118 --> 15:46.293
UM...

15:46.293 --> 15:48.817
YOU KNOW WHAT,
GRIFFIN? DON'T, OK?

15:48.817 --> 15:50.862
JUST GO.
LEAVE ME ALONE.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.911
YOU'RE NOT STAYING HERE.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.739
YOU KNOW WHAT,
GRIFFIN?

15:57.739 --> 15:59.001
THIS WHOLE PATHETIC
LITTLE KIDNAPPING
FANTASY

15:59.001 --> 16:00.568
OF YOURS IS OVER,

16:00.568 --> 16:02.222
SO YOU DON'T GET
TO TELL ME
WHAT TO DO ANYMORE!

16:04.746 --> 16:07.270
SINCE WHEN HAVE I EVER
TOLD YOU WHAT TO DO?

16:07.270 --> 16:09.011
HUH? YOU'VE BEEN
MARCHING ME AROUND

16:09.011 --> 16:10.273
SINCE THE DAY
WE FIRST MET.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.406
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.147
YOU WANTED US TO MOVE
INTO THE SHED...

16:14.147 --> 16:15.887
YOU WANTED ME
TO SELL MY SHOP,

16:15.887 --> 16:17.498
YOU WANTED TO GO
BACK TO SCHOOL,

16:17.498 --> 16:19.065
AND EVERY TIME I SAID
WHATEVER YOU WANT, JULE,

16:19.065 --> 16:22.111
LIKE AN IDIOT...
THINKING MAYBE,

16:22.111 --> 16:23.504
MAYBE...

16:25.419 --> 16:27.987
BUT, UH, LOOKS LIKE ALL
YOU REALLY EVER WANTED

16:27.987 --> 16:29.727
WAS FOR SOMEBODY JUST
TO BEAT THE SELFISHNESS
RIGHT OUT OF YOU.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.270
THANKS FOR COMING
RIGHT OVER.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.098
WELL, WHEN
I HEARD THAT HE GOT
IN A FIGHT, I--

16:52.098 --> 16:53.751
CHILDREN FIGHT.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.362
EVEN BEST FRIENDS.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.059
HEWLY WAS TEASING OWEN

16:57.059 --> 16:58.713
AFTER READ-ALOUD.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.715
YOU COULDN'T
SEPARATE THEM?

17:00.715 --> 17:02.238
OH. THIS WAS
ON THE PLAYGROUND

17:02.238 --> 17:03.805
DURING BREAK.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.067
MR. SALINGER,

17:05.067 --> 17:07.504
IS OWEN GETTING
THE EXTRA HOURS
AT NIGHT

17:07.504 --> 17:09.811
WITH HIS READING?

17:09.811 --> 17:10.899
HE'S GETTING
WHAT HE NEEDS.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.422
3 EXTRA HOURS A NIGHT?

17:15.904 --> 17:17.688
DO YOU KNOW
THE MESSAGE
WE'RE SENDING HIM...

17:17.688 --> 17:19.995
TELLING HIM
THAT HE HAS TO
WORK LIKE THAT,

17:19.995 --> 17:22.302
THAT HE HAS
TO TAKE 3 HOURS
TO DO SOMETHING

17:22.302 --> 17:24.434
THAT HIS FRIEND
HEWLY CAN DO
IN 20 MINUTES?

17:24.434 --> 17:26.523
WE'RE TELLING HIM
THAT HE'S STUPID,
MISS LOWE.

17:26.523 --> 17:29.004
LEARNING DISABILITIES
HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH BEING STUPID--

17:29.004 --> 17:31.093
I'M TALKING
ABOUT HOW HE FEELS,

17:31.093 --> 17:33.008
ABOUT HOW WE'RE
MAKING HIM FEEL,

17:33.008 --> 17:34.357
BECAUSE
WE'RE LABELING HIM,
MISS LOWE.

17:34.357 --> 17:35.880
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.535
LABELING HIM IS
WHAT HIS FRIENDS DO,
MR. SALINGER.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.755
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID
ON THE PLAYGROUND.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.322
THEN TEACHER
TO TEACHER,

17:42.322 --> 17:43.584
IT'S YOUR JOB
TO KEEP YOUR KIDS
IN LINE.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.414
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW, OWEN.

17:47.414 --> 17:48.632
HI, CHARLIE.

17:48.632 --> 17:49.981
HEY.

17:52.549 --> 17:55.596
HE STARTED IT.

17:55.596 --> 17:58.338
I TOLD HIM TO STOP,

17:58.338 --> 18:00.253
BUT HE WOULDN'T.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.689
AND THEN EVERYONE ELSE
STARTED IT,

18:01.689 --> 18:03.125
AND THEN...

18:03.125 --> 18:05.171
STARTED WHAT, OWE?

18:05.171 --> 18:08.348
CALLING ME NAMES.

18:08.348 --> 18:10.567
THEY'RE CALLING ME NAMES
AFTER READ-ALOUD,

18:10.567 --> 18:12.569
'CAUSE...

18:12.569 --> 18:15.703
BECAUSE WHAT
YOU WERE READING
OUT LOUD WAS HARD?

18:15.703 --> 18:19.098
IT WAS HARD, CHARLIE,
AND I WAS TRYING, BUT...

18:19.098 --> 18:20.838
BUT THEY WERE
CALLING ME...

18:20.838 --> 18:22.884
"SLOWEN"

18:22.884 --> 18:24.451
'CAUSE IT TAKES ME

18:24.451 --> 18:26.105
SO LONG TO READ.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.718
"SLOWEN"?

18:30.718 --> 18:32.937
I HATE THEM, CHARLIE.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.549
I HATE HEWLY
AND THE OTHERS.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.507
AND MRS. LOWE.
I HATE THEM ALL!

18:37.507 --> 18:39.161
YOU CAN'T HATE THEM ALL.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.207
AND YOU SURE
CAN'T START FIGHTING
WITH ALL OF THEM.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.730
THAT'S ONLY GOING
TO MAKE IT WORSE.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.253
WHY NOT, CHARLIE?

18:44.253 --> 18:46.125
YOU AND BAILEY
FIGHT ALL THE TIME.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.224
SOMEBODY, COME ON...

19:05.622 --> 19:06.493
THANK YOU.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.113
HI.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.984
GET IN.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.290
UM, ACTUALLY,
I WAS JUST WONDERING

19:21.290 --> 19:22.639
IF YOU HAD A PHONE
OR SOMETHING.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.206
GET--GET IN.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.513
WELL, I WOULD,
BUT IT'S NOT MY CAR.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.297
SEE, IT'S MY FRIEND'S,
AND SHE CAN'T LEAVE...

19:28.297 --> 19:29.646
GET IN!

19:32.127 --> 19:33.781
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

19:33.781 --> 19:36.000
UM...THERE'S ROOM
FOR MY HUSBAND, RIGHT?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.916
GRIFFIN? GRIFFIN!

19:44.487 --> 19:45.706
GRIFFIN, WAIT UP!

19:57.631 --> 19:59.415
HOW'S IT GOING
DOWN THERE?

19:59.415 --> 20:02.723
FINE.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.246
I DON'T SEE A LOT
OF PENCIL MOVING.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.292
THINKING.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.207
DO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN,
AND I'LL SLIDE DOWN THERE

20:08.207 --> 20:09.686
AND HELP YOU FINISH UP,
OK?

20:18.869 --> 20:20.349
YOU DONE, BIG GUY?

20:27.356 --> 20:30.403
THOSE LETTERS
ARE NOT REALLY...

20:30.403 --> 20:32.318
[SOFTLY] JEEZ...

20:32.318 --> 20:34.363
I CAN'T, CHARLIE.

20:34.363 --> 20:35.843
I CAN'T DO IT!

20:37.279 --> 20:39.542
OWEN...IT'S OK.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.718
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.807
IT'S HARD SOMETIMES.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.766
AND THERE'S LOTS
OF LETTERS...

20:45.766 --> 20:47.420
AND LOTS OF WORDS,
AND WE'RE GOING TO
SPEND LOTS OF TIME

20:47.420 --> 20:48.725
UNTIL WE GET THEM RIGHT.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.292
OK?

20:50.292 --> 20:51.946
HEY...

20:51.946 --> 20:53.208
IT'S GOING TO BE OK.

21:06.700 --> 21:07.701
WHAT?

21:07.701 --> 21:08.571
NOTHING.

21:10.834 --> 21:11.705
YOU JUST...

21:14.708 --> 21:16.405
EVERYBODY HAS THIS IDEA

21:16.405 --> 21:19.626
THAT NED IS,
LIKE, THIS MONSTER,
YOU KNOW?

21:19.626 --> 21:22.411
LIKE I'M HIS PRISONER,
LIVING IN FEAR,

21:22.411 --> 21:25.849
AND THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.547
I MEAN, YOU WERE RIGHT.

21:27.547 --> 21:28.809
WHEN HAVE I
EVER DONE ANYTHING

21:28.809 --> 21:30.985
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO?

21:30.985 --> 21:32.508
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

21:32.508 --> 21:34.075
STILL.

21:34.075 --> 21:37.165
SO NED AND MY RELATIONSHIP
ISN'T PERFECT.

21:37.165 --> 21:38.253
HE HITS YOU.

21:38.253 --> 21:39.733
HE LOVES ME.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.430
OH, HE LOVES YOU.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.258
WELL, DOES
HE HIT YOU BECAUSE
HE LOVES YOU,

21:43.258 --> 21:45.565
OR IS IT
THE OTHER WAY
AROUND, THEN?

21:45.565 --> 21:47.218
GRIFFIN, THAT'S NOT...

21:47.218 --> 21:49.220
IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT, OK?

21:49.220 --> 21:50.744
WE'RE LIKE
ANY OTHER COUPLE.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.354
WE HANG OUT,
WE SEE MOVIES,

21:52.354 --> 21:55.096
WE...HAVE FUN.
WE'RE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

21:55.096 --> 21:56.445
UNTIL HE HITS YOU.

21:56.445 --> 21:59.143
BECAUSE HE WILL.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.623
HE WILL HIT YOU
AGAIN.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.279
I JUST...

22:04.279 --> 22:05.672
I...

22:05.672 --> 22:07.021
WH-WHY DO YOU STAY
WITH HIM? I MEAN,

22:07.021 --> 22:10.111
WH-WHAT IS IT THAT
HE DOES FOR YOU?

22:10.111 --> 22:11.895
EVERYTHING.
HE TAKES CARE OF ME.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.159
HMM.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.770
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY

22:16.770 --> 22:18.119
ABOUT TAKING CARE
OF YOURSELF,

22:18.119 --> 22:19.729
BECAUSE HE
TAKES CARE OF YOU.

22:19.729 --> 22:22.384
THAT IS SO NOT
WHAT I MEANT. THAT--

22:22.384 --> 22:23.516
GOD, LOOK AT YOU.

22:23.516 --> 22:26.127
YOU'RE SO SMART.

22:26.127 --> 22:27.563
AND SO BEAUTIFUL.

22:29.739 --> 22:30.784
YOU CAN HAVE
ANYBODY.

22:30.784 --> 22:33.526
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.049
BUT INSTEAD YOU
HANG OUT WITH HIM.

22:35.049 --> 22:36.572
GOD!

22:36.572 --> 22:38.269
THIS IS SO...

22:38.269 --> 22:39.836
PERFECT,
COMING FROM YOU.

22:39.836 --> 22:41.882
I'M HIDING OUT?

22:41.882 --> 22:43.274
GRIFFIN, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S BEEN LIVING

22:43.274 --> 22:45.320
IN MY FAMILY'S GARAGE.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.930
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.

22:46.930 --> 22:49.019
WE BROKE UP
ALMOST A YEAR AGO,

22:49.019 --> 22:50.412
AND YOU'RE STILL HERE.

22:50.412 --> 22:51.979
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE,
GRIFFIN?

22:53.850 --> 22:55.199
I HAVE NO IDEA.

22:57.550 --> 22:59.639
BECAUSE...
YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:59.639 --> 23:00.727
I DON'T HAVE A LIFE.

23:00.727 --> 23:02.685
I HAD A LIFE.

23:02.685 --> 23:03.338
WITH YOU.

23:05.340 --> 23:06.950
BUT I GAVE THAT UP

23:06.950 --> 23:08.604
SO THAT YOU COULD
HAVE WHAT YOU WANT.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.960
SO HOW DO YOU THINK
THAT MAKES ME FEEL,
JULE?

23:19.615 --> 23:21.922
TO FIND OUT THAT...
YOU WANTED THIS?

23:24.141 --> 23:25.752
TO KNOW
THAT YOU'D RATHER BE

23:25.752 --> 23:27.536
WITH SOME GUY
THAT HITS YOU...

23:28.798 --> 23:30.017
THAN TO BE WITH ME?

23:47.077 --> 23:48.557
Julia: FINALLY.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.037
THERE'S A BUDDY
OF MINE AT THE SHOP

23:50.037 --> 23:51.430
WHO CAN PROBABLY
GIVE US A TOW.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.822
YEAH, THANKS, BUT...

23:52.822 --> 23:54.345
OH, YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.695
YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GO CALL NED

23:55.695 --> 23:58.001
BEFORE
HE GETS PISSED.

23:58.001 --> 24:00.308
I MEAN IT. I MEAN,
HE EXPECTS YOU TO,
SO...

24:02.179 --> 24:03.964
IT'S YOUR LIFE,
JULE. I'M...

24:03.964 --> 24:06.053
I'M NOT GOING TO
TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.707
YOU NEED 35 CENTS?

24:07.707 --> 24:10.579
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:10.579 --> 24:12.451
NO, FORGET IT.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.496
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT,
GRIFFIN?

24:14.496 --> 24:15.932
YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.630
YOU THINK YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING

24:17.630 --> 24:19.240
THAT GOES ON
IN MY HEAD,

24:19.240 --> 24:20.850
BUT YOU DON'T.

24:20.850 --> 24:23.331
AND
THIS WHOLE STUNT TODAY,
IT JUST PROVES TO ME

24:23.331 --> 24:24.637
THAT YOU NEVER DID.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.514
AND YEAH,
I'M CALLING NED.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.429
BUT NOT BECAUSE
HE EXPECTS ME TO,

24:34.429 --> 24:37.127
BECAUSE I CHOOSE TO.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.869
BECAUSE I LOVE HIM.

24:39.869 --> 24:42.481
YOU GOT THAT?

24:46.833 --> 24:48.661
I NEED 35 CENTS.

25:13.947 --> 25:14.948
KIRSTEN.

25:14.948 --> 25:15.949
HI.

25:15.949 --> 25:16.950
HEY.

25:16.950 --> 25:18.386
HI.

25:18.386 --> 25:19.343
GOD.

25:22.259 --> 25:23.739
OH, UM...
SIT BACK DOWN.
FINISH YOUR SUPPER.

25:23.739 --> 25:25.175
I'M NOT GOING
TO STAY.

25:25.175 --> 25:26.176
WOW.

25:26.176 --> 25:28.222
WHAT A SURPRISE.

25:28.222 --> 25:30.572
WHEN YOUR NOTE SAID
YOU WERE, UH...

25:30.572 --> 25:32.618
GIVING ME SOME SPACE,
I DIDN'T REALIZE

25:32.618 --> 25:34.184
HOW MUCH SPACE
THAT WOULD BE.

25:34.184 --> 25:37.231
I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE HERE
IN A WAY THAT...

25:37.231 --> 25:39.407
ISN'T GOOD FOR ME.
THAT'S ALL IT WAS,
CHARLIE.

25:39.407 --> 25:40.930
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE
TO STAY AWAY COMPLETELY.

25:40.930 --> 25:43.193
UM...
I THINK IT DOES.

25:43.193 --> 25:45.631
BUT...YOU KNOW,
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT
WHY I'M HERE.

25:45.631 --> 25:48.329
UM...
I'M HERE BECAUSE...

25:48.329 --> 25:49.330
WELL, IT'S...

25:49.330 --> 25:51.811
IT'S ABOUT OWEN.

25:51.811 --> 25:54.074
OWEN. WHAT ABOUT HIM?

25:54.074 --> 25:55.510
HOW'S HE BEEN,
CHARLIE?

25:55.510 --> 25:56.946
HE'S BEEN...

25:58.600 --> 26:00.559
KIRSTEN, COME ON.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.038
WHAT IS THIS,
OUT OF THE BLUE
YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT OWEN?

26:04.737 --> 26:06.042
I READ HIS TEST RESULTS.

26:06.042 --> 26:07.391
BAILEY GAVE THEM TO ME,

26:07.391 --> 26:09.611
AND I'M--I'M REALLY
WORRIED, CHARLIE.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.744
I THINK OWEN HAS
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.963
BAILEY.

26:13.963 --> 26:15.356
BAILEY'S BEEN BY
TO SEE YOU.

26:15.356 --> 26:16.836
LOOK, I KNOW...

26:16.836 --> 26:19.665
I KNOW
THAT THERE'S STUFF
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

26:19.665 --> 26:20.970
HIM COMING BY,
HE WAS JUST--

26:20.970 --> 26:22.145
HE WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

26:22.145 --> 26:25.148
YEAH. TO...GET THE KID
AWAY FROM ME.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.847
I TOLD YOU, I AM
STAYING OUT OF THAT.

26:27.847 --> 26:30.589
COULD YOU JUST...
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING
ON WITH OWEN?

26:32.373 --> 26:33.287
OK.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.858
I TALKED TO
A COUPLE OF EXPERTS.

26:38.858 --> 26:41.338
THIS WOMAN
AT, UH, AT BERKELEY

26:41.338 --> 26:42.949
WHO'S WRITTEN A COUPLE
OF BOOKS ON THIS.

26:42.949 --> 26:44.515
SHE HASN'T SEEN
OWEN YET,

26:44.515 --> 26:47.475
BUT SHE DID SAY
A COUPLE OF THINGS
THAT MADE SENSE.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.346
I DON'T GET IT.
THIS IS FOR OWEN?

26:49.346 --> 26:50.347
A GIFT?

26:50.347 --> 26:52.480
YEAH.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.003
HE'S GOING
TO NEED A REWARD

26:54.003 --> 26:55.788
FOR ALL THE EXTRA WORK
WE'RE ABOUT TO DO,

26:55.788 --> 26:58.617
SOMETHING THAT IMPROVES
HAND-EYE COORDINATION
IS BEST.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.923
IT COULD HELP
HIS CONFIDENCE.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.535
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

27:04.535 --> 27:06.668
IT ALL SOUNDS...

27:06.668 --> 27:07.582
GREAT.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.848
LISTEN, I KNOW
IT'S NO COINCIDENCE

27:12.848 --> 27:14.807
THAT OWEN STARTED
TO MAKE A MESS
OF HIS SCHOOLWORK

27:14.807 --> 27:16.373
WHEN DIANA FIRST CAME.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.897
CHARLIE, THAT'S--

27:17.897 --> 27:19.638
THIS IS GOING
TO WORK, KIRSTEN.
THERE'S NOTHING

27:19.638 --> 27:21.552
THAT ME SPENDING
MORE TIME WITH OWEN
CAN'T FIX,

27:21.552 --> 27:23.772
AND EVERYONE WILL SEE IT.
BAILEY'LL SEE IT,

27:23.772 --> 27:26.862
AND HE'LL FALL IN LINE
WITH ME ON THIS...

27:26.862 --> 27:28.472
AND THE FIGHTING
WILL STOP.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.129
[VEHICLE APPROACHING]

27:38.613 --> 27:40.528
I WON'T SAY
ANYTHING, OK?

27:49.102 --> 27:50.407
HI.

27:52.105 --> 27:53.106
YOU OK?

27:53.106 --> 27:54.107
MM-HMM.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.108
YOU SURE?

27:59.329 --> 28:00.243
WHY DON'T YOU
GO SIT IN THE CAR?

28:00.243 --> 28:01.636
NED, DON'T. PLEASE.

28:01.636 --> 28:02.898
JULIA?

28:05.640 --> 28:07.555
YOU COME
ANYWHERE NEAR HER...

28:07.555 --> 28:10.210
NED, LET'S GO HOME.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.174
IT'S COLD. HERE.

28:18.174 --> 28:19.785
NO, I'M OK.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.221
WHAT, YOU WANT
TO FREEZE TO DEATH?

28:21.221 --> 28:22.396
OK.

28:58.867 --> 28:59.738
OK.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.524
NOW I'M ALL YOURS.

29:03.524 --> 29:04.786
NO, I KNOW
YOU'RE BUSY AND ALL.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.527
WAIT. FOR YOU
TO COME DOWN HERE,

29:06.527 --> 29:08.007
IT MUST BE
IMPORTANT. SO?

29:08.007 --> 29:11.053
YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.447
YOU CAN IMAGINE
WHAT IT'S LIKE AT
THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

29:13.447 --> 29:14.535
CHARLIE?

29:14.535 --> 29:17.451
NO. CHARLIE AND YOU.

29:17.451 --> 29:19.366
BOTH OF YOU.
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
NOT EVEN SUPPOSED

29:19.366 --> 29:21.760
TO COME THERE
ANYMORE, I MEAN...

29:21.760 --> 29:23.022
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW THAT HAPPENED.

29:23.022 --> 29:25.067
I KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.
BECAUSE CHARLIE--

29:25.067 --> 29:26.939
STOP! YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO SAY 'CAUSE CHARLIE
DID THIS OR THAT,

29:26.939 --> 29:29.071
OR 'CAUSE HE'S
IN THE WRONG, BUT...

29:29.071 --> 29:30.594
YOU KNOW WHAT, BAILEY?
I CAN'T TAKE BOTH OF YOU

29:30.594 --> 29:31.770
FIGHTING LIKE THIS
ANYMORE.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.033
CLAUDIA, BELIEVE ME.

29:34.033 --> 29:36.078
IF I DIDN'T HAVE
TO BE DOING THIS,

29:36.078 --> 29:39.255
IF I FELT
LIKE THERE WAS
ANY OTHER WAY...

29:39.255 --> 29:41.910
BUT I REALLY BELIEVE
THAT OWEN WOULD BE
BETTER OFF WITH ME,

29:41.910 --> 29:43.390
THAT HE NEEDS
TO BE WITH ME.

29:43.390 --> 29:45.740
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO AGREE WITH THAT.

29:48.395 --> 29:50.789
ALL I KNOW IS...

29:50.789 --> 29:52.660
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN WITH JULIA,

29:52.660 --> 29:55.184
AND ALL YOU TWO DO
IS TEAR EACH OTHER
APART.

29:58.274 --> 30:00.755
IT FEELS LIKE
THE HOUSE IS FALLING
DOWN, BAILEY.

30:03.149 --> 30:04.106
I CAN'T HELP IT.

30:14.464 --> 30:17.076
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:17.076 --> 30:18.338
NOTHING.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.428
JULE...

30:21.428 --> 30:22.646
HE JUST WANTED TO TALK.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.261
REALLY?

30:28.261 --> 30:30.263
WHAT HE SAY?

30:30.263 --> 30:30.872
NOTHING.

30:34.136 --> 30:36.051
HE WAS WORRIED
ABOUT ME.

30:39.054 --> 30:41.100
JULE, I THINK WE GOT
TO CALL THE POLICE
ON THIS GUY.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.450
NED.

30:43.450 --> 30:46.627
LOOK, I'M NOT
GOING TO TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO...

30:46.627 --> 30:50.370
BUT THIS GUY TOTALLY
WENT OFF ON ME

30:50.370 --> 30:52.285
AND BASICALLY
KIDNAPPED YOU.

30:52.285 --> 30:54.026
WE WENT FOR A DRIVE.
THAT'S ALL.

30:54.026 --> 30:56.942
YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE
TO MAKE THE CALL.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.726
I'LL GO DOWN THERE,

42:24.629 --> 42:27.806
IT WASN'T WHAT HE SAID.

42:27.806 --> 42:29.982
NO...

42:29.982 --> 42:31.940
NO.

42:31.940 --> 42:33.899
NO. IT WAS, UM...

42:35.814 --> 42:37.206
WHAT?

42:41.559 --> 42:44.126
I THOUGHT IT WAS LOVE.

42:44.126 --> 42:45.258
YOU KNOW?

42:45.258 --> 42:47.826
THIS THING WITH HIM.

42:47.826 --> 42:50.350
I THOUGHT IT WAS...

42:50.350 --> 42:52.831
HIM AND ME AGAINST...

42:52.831 --> 42:54.528
EVERYTHING ELSE,

42:54.528 --> 42:57.705
EVERYTHING
THAT EVER HURT ME.

43:01.230 --> 43:04.973
MY LAST YEAR AT HOME,
MY BREAKUP WITH GRIFFIN,

43:04.973 --> 43:10.022
AND EVEN MY MOM
AND DAD...

43:12.546 --> 43:15.810
I THOUGHT, UH...

43:15.810 --> 43:20.859
I THOUGHT IF I CHOSE HIM
AND I PUSHED AWAY
EVERYONE ELSE

43:20.859 --> 43:26.168
AND I LOST MYSELF IN US,

43:26.168 --> 43:30.956
THAT I WOULD BE SAFE
FROM ALL THE BAD STUFF.

43:30.956 --> 43:35.917
AND THAT I'D BE MAKING
THIS REALLY GREAT AND
SAFE THING WITH HIM.

43:43.403 --> 43:46.798
BUT ALL I REALLY DID
WAS LOSE MYSELF.

43:58.592 --> 44:00.681
MR. SALINGER.

44:00.681 --> 44:02.944
DID YOU GET THAT MATTER
WORKED OUT WITH YOUR FAMILY?

44:02.944 --> 44:05.555
NO, I DIDN'T.

44:05.555 --> 44:09.081
AND, NOW, THINGS
HAVE GOTTEN WORSE.

44:11.866 --> 44:13.128
THAT'S MY BROTHER'S ARM.

44:14.086 --> 44:16.218
I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD.
