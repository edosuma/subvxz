WEBVTT

00:10.358 --> 00:11.794
<i>Previously on</i> From...

00:11.924 --> 00:13.100
We have to turn around.
We can't be here! Stop the bus!

00:13.230 --> 00:14.449
Everyone please
return to your seats!

00:14.579 --> 00:17.191
Bad things are gonna
happen if--

00:17.321 --> 00:19.193
Stop the goddamn bus!

00:19.323 --> 00:21.325
- Donna!
- What?

00:21.456 --> 00:25.503
There is a bus parked
outside the diner!

00:26.722 --> 00:28.202
There's a woman
trapped in the basement

00:28.332 --> 00:30.552
of that house over there.
We could use some help.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.033
Places don't just
come apart like this!

00:33.163 --> 00:34.164
Jim! Come!

00:34.295 --> 00:35.470
Wait, we're almost there.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.601
Elgin?

00:38.168 --> 00:39.343
I need some help
over here!

00:47.395 --> 00:48.613
Dad!

00:48.744 --> 00:50.137
Julie!

00:50.267 --> 00:52.182
In order to get us
all three out safely,

00:52.313 --> 00:54.576
you have to do it slowly

00:54.706 --> 00:56.360
and you gotta do it right.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.145
Dad, the sun is
about to go down.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.190
That's why you're
gonna leave us here.

01:00.321 --> 01:01.626
Everyone on, right now.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.019
- We're leaving.
- Hold on!

01:03.150 --> 01:04.194
- Start the--
- No! No, no!

01:04.325 --> 01:05.761
Donna!

01:07.197 --> 01:08.285
Fatima, get back here!

01:08.416 --> 01:09.765
We can't just leave them!

01:09.895 --> 01:11.506
- Fatima!
- Fatima!

01:11.636 --> 01:14.248
Inside the diner, now!

01:15.249 --> 01:17.077
- I love you too, Dad.
- We have to get inside!

01:17.207 --> 01:19.209
Let's go. Inside. Inside!

01:19.340 --> 01:22.169
They're here. We have to go.

01:22.299 --> 01:24.040
- Where are we?
- We're underneath the town.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.781
This is where
the monsters live.

01:25.911 --> 01:28.262
This is where they sleep.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.220
There's a tunnel!
Please, go all the way up.

01:30.351 --> 01:31.352
Go, go, go, go.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.137
Victor!

01:34.268 --> 01:35.747
Part of me really wants
to go to Iceland

01:35.878 --> 01:37.271
with the most amazing guy
I met

01:37.401 --> 01:39.142
in the most
fucked-up place imaginable.

01:39.273 --> 01:40.404
What does the other part want?

01:40.535 --> 01:42.276
To go back and find out if

01:42.406 --> 01:44.365
the woman I fell in love with
waited for me.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.415
Anybody up there?

01:52.024 --> 01:55.245
I can help you if you help me.

02:04.863 --> 02:06.474
You made it.

02:06.604 --> 02:07.562
What the--

02:10.217 --> 02:12.219
We don't have
much time.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.525
I need you to kill me.

02:26.581 --> 02:27.756
The fuck?

02:27.886 --> 02:29.236
Where are we?

02:30.889 --> 02:32.848
We had a deal.

02:32.978 --> 02:35.242
You said
you would kill me.

02:37.026 --> 02:38.288
Jesus.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.640
Who did this to you?

02:44.033 --> 02:45.861
Are you from the town?

02:45.991 --> 02:48.472
What, the town--?

02:48.603 --> 02:49.473
Yeah.
- Oh. The to--

02:49.604 --> 02:50.866
- Oh.
- The to--

02:50.996 --> 02:54.478
I-I always thought the town
was the worst part,

02:54.609 --> 02:56.785
and then I went
through the tree.

02:59.483 --> 03:01.137
Did you go through
the tree?

03:01.268 --> 03:03.183
Yeah.

03:04.793 --> 03:05.750
The tree, yeah.

03:07.361 --> 03:10.929
You go in one place,
come out another.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.714
Sometimes you get stuck.

03:12.844 --> 03:15.586
Sometimes
you get trapped.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.632
Now, that's
when they get you.

03:19.503 --> 03:20.635
Who?

03:22.071 --> 03:24.334
You-- You have a kind face.

03:25.466 --> 03:26.641
What's your name?

03:28.643 --> 03:30.514
I'm Boyd.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.212
I'm Martin.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.391
How long
you been here, Martin?

03:37.521 --> 03:39.871
Oh, it's-- it's been
a long-- Ah!

03:40.002 --> 03:41.395
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.310
I used to try
to count the days,

03:43.440 --> 03:46.400
but I couldn't bear
to count the years.

03:46.530 --> 03:49.272
It's been so long since
I've seen kindness.

03:49.403 --> 03:50.839
That's why
you have to go,

03:50.969 --> 03:52.014
before they come back.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.581
I'm not leaving
without you.

03:53.711 --> 03:56.845
Boyd.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.803
Wait, you--
you're a Marine?

03:59.804 --> 04:00.849
Semper fi.

04:02.851 --> 04:06.550
Leave no man behind.
You help me, I help you.

04:06.681 --> 04:07.986
That's the way it goes,
got it?

04:08.117 --> 04:09.945
Boyd, if you want to help me,

04:10.075 --> 04:11.816
then just kill me.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.951
Please.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.909
Everybody calm down!

04:18.040 --> 04:20.260
Calm the fuck down!

04:26.570 --> 04:31.053
Please, you haven't done
anything yet you can't undo.

04:31.183 --> 04:33.664
This is just
a big misunderstanding.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.624
People are upset,
but if you'll let us go--

04:36.754 --> 04:38.408
You wanna go?

04:38.539 --> 04:40.845
You have no idea
what's waiting out there.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.587
Where's Kristi?

04:43.718 --> 04:45.459
She's in the back
with the girl from the bus.

04:45.589 --> 04:46.895
- The nurse.
- Sit down.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.464
You too, sit!

04:51.987 --> 04:53.510
Okay.

04:55.425 --> 04:56.861
I know this is scary...

04:58.515 --> 05:01.301
but we
are not the enemy.

05:02.127 --> 05:05.000
The enemy's out there.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.567
Well, that's an odd
thing to say--

05:06.697 --> 05:09.352
Please,
just let me explain.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.659
Okay.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.051
Okay, let's start

05:13.182 --> 05:15.576
with the tree
you saw in the road.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.406
How did you know
about the tree?

05:20.450 --> 05:22.409
Everyone sees the tree.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.020
We can hide in there
till morning.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.718
Yeah.

07:37.848 --> 07:38.849
Okay.

07:41.591 --> 07:42.723
Go in.

07:43.941 --> 07:46.683
We have to be quiet.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.685
There's no talisman in here.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.170
Whose stuff is this?

07:55.300 --> 07:57.607
This is mine.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.914
Why is it here?

08:00.044 --> 08:01.611
I come here sometimes.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.445
I have some food for us.

08:18.019 --> 08:19.499
Mari.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.849
How could you?

08:25.374 --> 08:27.071
We were supposed
to have lunch.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.946
I was on my way to meet you.
We were supposed to have lunch.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.210
I know.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.777
Have you been here
this whole time?

08:37.865 --> 08:41.651
It's been six months.
You never called, you never...

08:45.699 --> 08:47.135
You know, your parents and I...

08:50.355 --> 08:52.575
...we went to the police.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.148
Mari, you don't understand--

09:00.278 --> 09:02.019
Bullshit.

09:02.629 --> 09:06.937
This whole time you've been
less than two hours away,

09:07.068 --> 09:09.113
with these people,

09:09.244 --> 09:11.246
with shotguns,

09:11.376 --> 09:12.987
that fucking woman.

09:15.163 --> 09:17.121
It's like you've joined
some fucking cult.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.689
I gotta get out of here.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.125
You can't leave the diner.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.649
Get out of my way.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.259
You need to listen
to me, okay?

09:24.955 --> 09:28.002
You don't get to tell me
what I can and cannot do.

09:36.271 --> 09:37.577
Look.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.145
I know you're hurt.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.712
Mm-hm.

09:42.843 --> 09:45.846
And that this is
beyond fucked up.

09:47.891 --> 09:51.025
But I-I just need you
to listen to me, okay?

09:55.290 --> 09:56.596
This place.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.603
It isn't what you think.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.041
How you doing
over there, Jim?

10:08.259 --> 10:10.610
I think I busted a rib.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.176
It's getting
hard to breathe.

10:12.307 --> 10:13.787
Just take it slow.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.746
We'll be okay.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.706
Have you ever done this before?

10:20.794 --> 10:22.622
Spent the night hiding?

10:23.971 --> 10:25.625
Would it make you feel
better if I said yes?

10:32.240 --> 10:34.198
What the fuck.
Fuck!

10:35.722 --> 10:37.245
I can't move!

10:37.375 --> 10:38.246
Help!

10:38.376 --> 10:39.769
It's Rick, right?

10:41.031 --> 10:42.380
Brick!
My name's Brick.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.121
Okay, you gotta calm down, buddy.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.689
Hey, you need to get me
out of here, okay? Please.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.170
- Brick. Brick.
- My chest hurts.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.388
- Brick?
- Yeah?

10:50.519 --> 10:52.129
You gotta stay quiet, man.

10:52.260 --> 10:55.959
I'm coming over to you,
buddy, okay?

10:56.090 --> 10:57.744
I ca-- I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

10:57.874 --> 10:59.267
Yes, you can.

10:59.397 --> 11:01.704
You're talkin', right?
That means you can breathe.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.880
Just nice and slow.

11:05.229 --> 11:08.102
Okay? Tom?

11:08.232 --> 11:09.886
Almost there.

11:11.801 --> 11:12.889
Stop!

11:17.807 --> 11:20.114
Come on, man,
you gotta stop moving.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.120
Hey, look at me.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.992
You see me?

11:29.123 --> 11:31.821
Yeah.
Yeah, I can see you.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.171
Just, um, look I'm, uh,

11:34.302 --> 11:37.261
not really good in
tight spaces, all right?

11:37.392 --> 11:38.741
It's all right.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.309
Just, you gotta be quiet.

11:41.439 --> 11:44.268
I'm right here.
We're both right here, okay?

11:44.399 --> 11:47.054
We're gonna get outta this.

11:47.184 --> 11:50.797
We just gotta stay calm
and not make things worse.

11:50.927 --> 11:54.975
Most of all,
we gotta be quiet.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.152
As quiet as we can.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.719
Why?

12:07.291 --> 12:08.945
Come on, man.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.730
There's gotta be something.

12:13.297 --> 12:16.213
Even if you get me free,
then what?

12:16.344 --> 12:18.215
I don't think
I can make it to town.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.478
Then I'll carry you. Huh?

12:20.609 --> 12:23.307
Once we get back to town,
look, we got-- we got people.

12:23.438 --> 12:24.787
A doctor.
She can help you.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.180
Hey, look.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.921
You see this?

12:29.139 --> 12:30.880
I found these
in the forest.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.926
They protect us.
Keep us safe.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.015
They won't be able
to hurt you there.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.800
You think-- you think
those things that come out

12:37.931 --> 12:39.933
of the forest
at night did this?

12:40.585 --> 12:42.762
They're just
the tip of the spear.

12:42.892 --> 12:45.547
Hey, how 'bout we change
the subject, huh?

12:45.677 --> 12:47.070
Hey, Martin,
where you from?

12:47.201 --> 12:49.246
A small town. Millbrook.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.421
Where?

12:50.552 --> 12:51.858
Millbrook, huh?

12:51.988 --> 12:53.816
You're wa-- wasting time.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.082
Oh, God.

12:59.213 --> 13:01.128
- They're coming.
- What the--

13:04.566 --> 13:06.307
You don't
have time, Boyd.

13:08.265 --> 13:11.007
There's darkness
in the forest.

13:11.138 --> 13:14.054
Nightmares you can't
even begin to imagine.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.883
Things we were never
meant to see. Things that...

13:19.102 --> 13:21.365
You have to get out
before the music stops.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.278
Don't.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.150
The more attention
you draw to the house,

14:07.281 --> 14:09.892
the more likely those things
are to go looking around.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.372
I can't just
sit here doing nothing.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.287
That is exactly
what you're gonna do.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.987
You-- Come on, sit down.

14:28.215 --> 14:31.174
Julie, your dad's best
chance right now is to stay

14:31.305 --> 14:33.133
exactly where he is
until the morning.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.572
People used to do it
all the time here.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.139
They hid.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.620
That's how Sheriff Boyd
and his family

14:42.751 --> 14:44.144
survived the first night.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.191
I know.

14:48.322 --> 14:52.021
Hey, look, all we can do
right now is wait.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.027
Do you want some tea?

15:07.080 --> 15:09.909
What, uh--
what's your favorite book?

15:11.301 --> 15:12.085
What?

15:12.215 --> 15:14.130
You do read, right?

15:14.261 --> 15:16.045
What's your favorite book?

15:16.176 --> 15:18.700
You're just trying
to distract me.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.529
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.532
But you still gotta
answer the question.

15:36.587 --> 15:39.547
Just when I thought life
was all out of surprises.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.525
Hello?

16:01.656 --> 16:02.962
Anybody here?

16:04.398 --> 16:05.965
This is
a weird gas station.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.011
Yeah.

16:11.361 --> 16:13.015
This whole fuckin'
place is weird.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.539
It's like we drove
into a goddamn acid trip.

16:15.670 --> 16:19.326
There are worse places
to be stuck, I suppose.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.950
Can anybody hear me?

16:35.081 --> 16:37.300
God dammit,
where did they all go?

16:37.431 --> 16:38.606
We need to go back inside.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.086
- What? No.
- Come on.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.478
No. We have to find them.
We can't just leave

16:41.609 --> 16:42.827
- those people out here.
- Look, we tried. We tried.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.351
There's nothing more we can do.
Okay? Come on.

16:45.569 --> 16:47.049
Hey!
If you were on the bus,

16:47.180 --> 16:48.659
if you can hear me,
you have to run.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.705
You have to run
and be as quiet as you can.

16:50.835 --> 16:53.273
There are things out here,
things that if they find you,

16:53.403 --> 16:55.318
they'll-- if somebody
calls for you...

16:55.449 --> 16:56.711
- Okay, inside!
- ...do not answer!

16:56.841 --> 16:58.060
Inside, now! Inside, now!

16:58.191 --> 17:00.062
If somebody calls for you
do not answer!

17:13.902 --> 17:16.122
You're spoiling all the fun.

17:18.472 --> 17:19.473
Fuck!

17:20.430 --> 17:22.171
No, Fatima!
No, stop!

17:24.478 --> 17:25.479
Hey!

17:25.609 --> 17:26.567
Fatima!

17:29.178 --> 17:30.266
Oh, no.

17:30.397 --> 17:33.313
Hey! Hey! Hey!

17:33.443 --> 17:34.792
You need to run!
You need to hide!

17:34.923 --> 17:37.056
Fatima, hey, hey, baby.

17:37.186 --> 17:38.622
Baby, come away from
the window, okay?

17:38.753 --> 17:39.797
Hey! You should run!

17:39.928 --> 17:41.538
You need run!
You need to hide!

17:41.669 --> 17:43.236
You have to get inside!

17:43.366 --> 17:45.542
Hey!
They're not listening!

17:45.673 --> 17:47.196
- Hey!
- Hey, hey.

17:47.327 --> 17:48.154
- What?
- I know.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.372
We have to do something!

17:49.503 --> 17:50.373
Baby, there is nothing
that we can do!

17:50.504 --> 17:52.245
I'm going to the back door.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.550
- No.
- Ellis!

17:53.681 --> 17:55.596
Ellis, we can
literally sneak out.

17:55.726 --> 17:58.251
We have to bring them inside!
We can bring them inside!

17:58.381 --> 17:59.730
I know, I know!
Baby, listen to me--

17:59.861 --> 18:00.775
Baby, you need to stop!
Baby, look, listen!

18:05.649 --> 18:07.260
Hey.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.697
Hey. It's okay.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.655
I'm here, you know?

18:12.656 --> 18:13.527
Hey.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.357
Baby.

18:17.487 --> 18:18.706
Baby.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.755
Fuck you.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.279
Fuck you!

18:28.237 --> 18:30.370
Stop fucking smiling!

18:31.675 --> 18:33.416
Stop smiling!

18:35.375 --> 18:37.638
You'll feel better
if you come outside.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.128
Fatima.

18:56.526 --> 18:59.616
I can't. I can't
fucking do this anymore.

18:59.747 --> 19:00.791
I can't...

19:00.922 --> 19:02.445
I know.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.274
I can't... I can't fucking
do this anymore.

19:05.405 --> 19:06.841
I know. I know.

19:06.971 --> 19:09.713
I can't.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.851
Is that-- is that them?

19:16.981 --> 19:17.808
Is that the...

19:17.939 --> 19:19.723
Yeah.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.943
Jesus. Jesus!

19:22.073 --> 19:24.641
Jesus fuck,
please, please!

19:24.772 --> 19:26.295
Please, God,
I just wanna go home.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.471
I just wanna go home, please!

19:28.602 --> 19:30.734
- God!
- Hey, man, you gotta shut up.

19:30.865 --> 19:32.127
I just wanna go home! Please!

19:32.997 --> 19:34.390
Hey, look at me.

19:35.739 --> 19:37.306
We're good.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.182
What's wrong?
What the-- what's wrong?

19:43.312 --> 19:44.748
Fucking bleeding!

19:46.446 --> 19:47.273
What the fuck?

19:47.403 --> 19:49.405
You gotta be quiet.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.799
I can't! I'm fucking bleeding
from my fuckin' mouth!

19:51.929 --> 19:53.366
You're gonna be okay.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.368
We just gotta hang on.

19:55.498 --> 19:58.632
God, I just wanna
fucking get outta here!

20:06.683 --> 20:08.772
My God,
this is really happening.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.690
Fuck this. Let us out.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.257
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
- Let us out.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.476
- Relax.
- Let us the fuck out.

20:16.606 --> 20:19.522
Hey! Hey, are you insane?
Are you insane?

20:19.653 --> 20:21.481
- Did you hear that?
- There's more people out there.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.483
You've got those people
trapped under the house!

20:23.613 --> 20:25.224
You can't just fuckin'
leave them! You have guns!

20:25.354 --> 20:27.269
It won't matter.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.749
Won't make
a fuckin' difference.

20:28.879 --> 20:30.838
Are you people fucking crazy?
I'm not gonna sit here--

20:32.579 --> 20:34.494
- Kenny!
- Hey, whoa, wait!

20:34.624 --> 20:35.843
Move!

20:35.973 --> 20:37.410
The fuck over there now!

20:37.540 --> 20:38.802
- Back the fuck up!
- Hey, hey.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.717
Now!

20:40.848 --> 20:42.328
Hurry the fuck up!

20:43.851 --> 20:46.201
All right, we're gonna
try this the fuck again.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.551
You stupid motherfucker.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.814
You have no idea
what you're doing.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.599
Yeah, we'll see.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.905
Now, me and my friend here are
gonna go take a walk outside.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.429
- Hey.
- No, shut the fuck up.

20:56.559 --> 20:57.604
Open the fucking door.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.258
We do that,

20:59.388 --> 21:01.695
you put everyone
in this room at risk.

21:02.826 --> 21:03.827
You want that?

21:06.526 --> 21:08.745
How'd the tree
get in the road? Huh?

21:08.876 --> 21:10.312
How many of you
did it take to lug

21:10.443 --> 21:11.357
that fuckin' thing
out there, huh?

21:11.487 --> 21:13.359
Are you fucking
kidding me?

21:13.489 --> 21:14.447
You actually think
that we--

21:14.577 --> 21:16.231
I honestly think
you're full of shit.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.537
And how 'bout
the rest of you?

21:17.667 --> 21:18.755
Huh?

21:18.886 --> 21:21.584
Just gonna sit there?

21:21.715 --> 21:24.761
This bitch blew out our ride
home with a fucking shotgun!

21:24.892 --> 21:26.720
You all seem
disturbingly okay with that.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.725
Everyone's scared. Okay?

21:32.900 --> 21:34.771
- They should be.
- I tend to be a little

21:34.902 --> 21:37.339
suspicious of people who tell
me how to fucking be scared.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.733
You just heard
those people outside, man!

21:39.863 --> 21:41.604
Yeah, that's right,
I "heard."

21:41.735 --> 21:44.346
Super convenient we can't
actually see anything.

21:44.477 --> 21:47.262
So, how 'bout
we go take a look?

21:47.393 --> 21:48.829
Okay.

21:48.959 --> 21:49.917
Let's move.

21:51.571 --> 21:52.789
Let's just talk, okay?

21:52.920 --> 21:54.791
- No, we're done talking.
- No, please, just relax--

21:54.922 --> 21:56.489
Shut the fuck up!

21:58.621 --> 22:00.797
Now, you are gonna
put down those guns

22:00.928 --> 22:02.190
and open the fuckin' door

22:02.321 --> 22:03.757
or I'm gonna put his
fucking brains on the wall.

22:05.062 --> 22:06.455
How 'bout that?

22:12.418 --> 22:13.810
Then you're gonna
have to shoot him.

22:17.814 --> 22:19.599
And I'm gonna have
to shoot you...

22:20.774 --> 22:22.993
...right in the fuckin' head,

22:23.124 --> 22:26.475
'cause you sure as shit
ain't opening those doors.

22:35.571 --> 22:36.703
Almost there.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.932
You ever wonder
if Abby was right?

22:49.063 --> 22:49.933
Wh--

22:53.110 --> 22:54.373
Hey, what did you say?

22:55.852 --> 22:57.985
What if it's all
just a dream?

22:58.115 --> 23:00.727
How the fuck do you--

23:02.685 --> 23:05.166
Martin! Wha-wha-what's--
what's goin'--

23:05.296 --> 23:06.863
what's--
what's goin' on, Martin?

23:06.994 --> 23:09.083
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.867
Martin. Okay, come here.
Come here--

23:10.998 --> 23:13.696
All right. All right.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.959
Okay.
Hey, Martin, come on.

23:27.231 --> 23:28.015
We're out of time!

23:30.278 --> 23:32.106
Come here, Martin--

23:32.236 --> 23:33.150
Let go, Martin!

23:33.281 --> 23:37.851
My blood
is your blood now.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.030
Martin?

23:45.249 --> 23:46.163
The fuck?

24:35.386 --> 24:38.564
Okay... okay...

24:46.093 --> 24:46.963
What the--

24:51.011 --> 24:52.578
Hey, hey. Hey.

25:02.152 --> 25:03.502
What...

25:33.706 --> 25:35.577
I'm, um...

25:35.708 --> 25:37.100
I'm making some tea.

25:46.980 --> 25:47.981
Uh, hi.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.940
Oh, hi.

25:51.898 --> 25:54.074
Uh, what are you doin'?

25:54.204 --> 25:57.033
My mom always says
that food cures all ills,

25:57.164 --> 25:58.165
so, I don't know.

25:59.688 --> 26:00.863
Tea.

26:00.994 --> 26:03.213
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I don't know.

26:03.344 --> 26:05.346
It's not like a cheese platter
is gonna fix anything, right?

26:05.476 --> 26:06.869
Well, I'd be pretty impressed

26:07.000 --> 26:09.132
if you whipped out a cheese
platter all of a sudden.

26:17.097 --> 26:18.141
You, um...

26:19.273 --> 26:21.014
You doing all right?

26:21.144 --> 26:23.059
That's--

26:23.190 --> 26:25.540
that's a pretty hard question
to answer right now.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.020
Yeah.

26:30.414 --> 26:31.851
Yeah.

26:33.287 --> 26:35.158
Uh, what about you? Is that--

26:37.030 --> 26:38.031
Is that really--

26:40.076 --> 26:41.164
Yeah.

26:42.470 --> 26:43.863
Yeah.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.607
Wow.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.048
Yeah.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.183
You should probably
get back out there.

27:01.924 --> 27:03.056
She's gonna need you,

27:03.186 --> 27:07.582
and it's a long time
until sunrise, so.

27:07.713 --> 27:08.888
Yeah.

27:14.502 --> 27:16.722
- I got it.
- Yeah.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.995
Maybe they
weren't screams, maybe...

27:29.125 --> 27:30.126
We're in the middle
of the woods.

27:30.257 --> 27:31.911
Maybe it was a coyote
or something.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.608
No, it's not
an animal, Kelly.

27:33.739 --> 27:34.827
You don't know that.

27:34.957 --> 27:36.132
I grew up
on a fucking farm.

27:36.263 --> 27:37.917
I know what
an animal sounds like.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.309
Well, maybe it's
a prank or something!

27:39.440 --> 27:41.094
- I don't know, Brian.
- Okay.

27:41.224 --> 27:43.966
Look, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have snapped.

27:45.576 --> 27:49.189
Hey, it's
an adventure, right?

27:49.319 --> 27:51.365
Right? Look, maybe--
maybe this is just gonna be

27:51.495 --> 27:54.107
like one of those,
I don't know,

27:54.237 --> 27:56.109
crazy stories that
we just tell at parties,

27:56.239 --> 27:58.241
and it'll be fun and it'll--

27:59.852 --> 28:01.767
Hello?

28:01.897 --> 28:03.116
Is anyone in there?

28:03.246 --> 28:06.336
Please, help us.
We were on a bus.

28:06.467 --> 28:09.122
We took a detour through town,
but we stopped and--

28:09.252 --> 28:12.908
- Hello?
- What the hell?

28:13.039 --> 28:14.301
- Don't go. Don't go, baby.
- I don't wanna die here.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.651
- We need help, please.
- We've gotta help them out!

28:16.782 --> 28:18.174
Wait--

28:18.305 --> 28:19.785
I'll be fine.

28:20.524 --> 28:21.961
Please help us.

28:23.136 --> 28:24.137
Please.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.979
Oh, thank God,
we heard the screaming.

30:07.109 --> 30:09.155
You picked a bad spot.

30:22.603 --> 30:25.562
Gus!
God dammit, slow down!

30:28.391 --> 30:30.132
Oh God. Fuck.

30:34.006 --> 30:36.443
Okay. Okay.
Oh, shit. This--

31:30.714 --> 31:32.194
The boy. The--

31:32.325 --> 31:34.153
The one who told you
to wait in the tunnels.

31:35.110 --> 31:36.416
He's my friend.

31:38.070 --> 31:40.028
For a long time
he went away,

31:40.159 --> 31:42.030
but now he's back.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.519
How long have you been here?

31:52.649 --> 31:54.260
Oh, it's been a while.

31:59.569 --> 32:00.527
How did you get here?

32:01.745 --> 32:03.965
I don't like
to talk about that.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.015
Oh, wow!

32:11.407 --> 32:12.408
I found them.

32:14.802 --> 32:16.108
Look.

32:17.326 --> 32:18.371
Yeah.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.201
Chocolate chip.

32:30.600 --> 32:31.993
If you don't want them,
you don't have to have--

32:32.124 --> 32:34.430
No, no, I--
I like chocolate.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.090
Thank you.

32:46.181 --> 32:48.053
I used to have
more snacks...

32:48.967 --> 32:51.404
but there haven't been
many new people

32:51.534 --> 32:54.363
come through here
in the last few months.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.585
Is that where you
get all this stuff?

33:00.761 --> 33:02.110
Some of it.

33:02.241 --> 33:04.373
I mean,
some of it was here already.

33:05.331 --> 33:06.985
Some of it belonged to my--

33:12.077 --> 33:13.165
To who?

33:17.865 --> 33:19.258
Who did you come here with?

33:22.565 --> 33:23.566
My mother.

33:24.872 --> 33:26.395
She was nice.

33:32.314 --> 33:35.187
Mm, I think--
I think I have some pretzels,

33:35.317 --> 33:36.449
'cause these are stale.

33:53.466 --> 33:56.556
- What the--
- Boyd?

33:56.686 --> 33:58.688
- What are you doing out here?
- Get in! Hurry!

33:58.819 --> 34:01.343
- They'll see you!
- Okay. It's okay.

34:01.474 --> 34:02.301
Don't worry.

34:02.431 --> 34:03.302
Look.

34:03.432 --> 34:05.173
- Oh, my God!
- We're okay.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.175
- We're okay.
- Help!

34:09.134 --> 34:10.135
Help me!

34:10.265 --> 34:11.701
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Stop!

34:11.832 --> 34:13.573
Please!

34:13.703 --> 34:16.141
I said stop!
Stop!

34:17.272 --> 34:20.536
Hey!
- They're killing people!

34:20.667 --> 34:21.755
- We need to close the door!
- They're coming, they're coming!

34:21.885 --> 34:23.148
- You need to run!
- Please!

34:23.278 --> 34:24.453
- Fuck! Come on!
- Please!

34:24.584 --> 34:26.586
- You need to get inside.
- Get in here! Come on.

34:26.716 --> 34:28.718
- Come on, come on!
- Run, run, run!

34:28.849 --> 34:29.676
- Come on!
- You need to get inside.

34:29.806 --> 34:31.199
Come, on, run, run, run!

34:31.330 --> 34:32.722
- Let's go! Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Run, run, run!

34:32.853 --> 34:33.723
We need to close
the door!

34:33.854 --> 34:35.116
Hurry up!

34:35.247 --> 34:36.291
Come on, come on.
Hurry up!

34:36.422 --> 34:38.076
- Move, move, move!
- Move, move, move!

34:38.206 --> 34:39.468
- Move!
- Close the door!

34:41.253 --> 34:43.298
Here.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.126
Okay.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.042
I'm sorry, I should've
stayed at the diner.

34:48.173 --> 34:49.261
I was scared.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.612
- Who are you?
- What?

34:53.917 --> 34:55.658
I asked you
a goddamn question!

34:55.789 --> 34:57.095
Elgin.

34:57.225 --> 34:59.184
My name's Elgin.

34:59.314 --> 35:00.402
I was on the bus!

35:00.533 --> 35:01.664
On the what?

35:02.926 --> 35:04.145
What--
What is he talking about?

35:04.276 --> 35:05.451
What-- What bus?

35:15.722 --> 35:17.158
It really hurts.

35:17.898 --> 35:20.683
You're doing great, man.
Just-- just hang in there.

35:22.946 --> 35:24.818
Just try to breathe, okay?

35:24.948 --> 35:26.602
We're gonna get out
of here before you know it.

35:29.866 --> 35:31.259
Hey, Brick.

35:31.390 --> 35:33.392
You like pancakes?

35:34.567 --> 35:36.308
Yeah.

35:36.438 --> 35:38.179
When the sun comes up,
you're gonna have the best

35:38.310 --> 35:40.399
goddamn pancakes you ever had.

35:42.401 --> 35:43.706
Come on now.

35:43.837 --> 35:46.231
You think this skinny
little fucker eats pancakes?

35:49.321 --> 35:50.496
Ow, fuck, that hurts.

35:50.626 --> 35:53.716
You know,
pancakes sound pretty--

35:56.589 --> 35:58.330
Ah, shit.

35:58.460 --> 35:59.766
Shit.

35:59.896 --> 36:03.291
Brick, Brick,
you gotta shut the fuck up, man.

36:03.422 --> 36:05.511
I know it hurts but keep quiet.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.817
Breathe it out.

36:07.948 --> 36:09.732
Nice and easy.

36:10.994 --> 36:12.300
Tom.

36:12.431 --> 36:13.606
You gotta
cover his mouth, man.

36:17.784 --> 36:19.742
I can't get to him!

36:42.765 --> 36:44.376
Tom, what's happening?

36:45.942 --> 36:47.553
Talk to me, man.
What is it?

36:49.381 --> 36:50.817
I think he's fucking dead.

37:00.653 --> 37:03.743
No, no, no! No! Get off! Jim!

37:06.702 --> 37:07.790
Get off me!

37:16.059 --> 37:17.452
Julie, Julie, no!
Julie, no!

37:17.583 --> 37:18.497
No, we have to go out there!

37:18.627 --> 37:19.802
- No!
- Please! We have to help!

37:19.933 --> 37:20.803
We can't. Julie, no!

37:20.934 --> 37:23.415
Julie! Julie!

37:23.545 --> 37:25.895
But they found him!
We have to help him, please!

37:26.026 --> 37:27.245
It's okay.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.248
I can't--

37:30.378 --> 37:32.293
I can't...

37:32.424 --> 37:33.425
It's okay.

37:36.036 --> 37:38.560
It's okay.

37:38.691 --> 37:42.825
I can't-- I can't--

37:42.956 --> 37:45.306
It'll be all right.

37:45.437 --> 37:47.830
It'll be all right.

37:52.095 --> 37:54.402
Please.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.439
I don't trust him.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.923
Look, we're still alive.

38:41.101 --> 38:42.581
For now.

38:47.063 --> 38:48.543
Tabitha.

38:50.502 --> 38:51.720
How you holding up?

38:54.201 --> 38:55.594
I'm fine.

38:59.902 --> 39:01.948
You know,

39:02.078 --> 39:04.429
I've probably passed
this truck about a dozen times,

39:04.559 --> 39:07.606
and I didn't reali--
Did you do all this?

39:08.781 --> 39:10.609
I thought you were
on a journey.

39:13.742 --> 39:14.961
I was.

39:16.658 --> 39:18.791
Did you find what
you were looking for?

39:22.098 --> 39:23.796
What are you drawing?

39:29.845 --> 39:30.977
Things I've seen.

39:32.935 --> 39:35.416
It's good to draw them
when you see them...

39:36.156 --> 39:40.508
so even if you forget,
the pictures remember.

39:44.686 --> 39:47.080
I thought they were dreams,

39:47.210 --> 39:48.690
all those things...

39:50.518 --> 39:52.477
but the pictures remembered.

40:18.154 --> 40:19.982
Oh, the sun's coming up.

40:39.741 --> 40:43.179

Julie!

42:04.086 --> 42:06.175
Oh! Dad!

42:06.306 --> 42:08.003
Okay, just hang on
one second, okay?

42:08.134 --> 42:09.004
We're gonna get you out.

42:09.135 --> 42:11.659
Son of a bitch.
Oh!

42:11.790 --> 42:14.009
He's alive!
Everybody, get out here!

42:14.140 --> 42:16.185
- Everybody help out, come on!
- Let's dig him out!

42:16.316 --> 42:17.578
Grab anything you can!

42:17.709 --> 42:18.884
Come on, let's go.

42:19.014 --> 42:20.712
- Hurry!
- We'll get you outta there.

42:20.842 --> 42:23.018
Careful! Careful, easy! Easy!

42:23.149 --> 42:25.717
Move this out of
the way! This is blocking...

42:25.847 --> 42:27.719
Come on,
get over here!

42:27.849 --> 42:29.851
Lend a hand!
We're gonna get you outta there!

42:48.957 --> 42:50.611
Oh...

43:34.002 --> 43:35.047
Okay.

43:35.177 --> 43:36.875
Yeah.

43:37.005 --> 43:37.919
Hey, kid.

43:38.050 --> 43:39.573
How many people
did you say?

43:39.704 --> 43:40.313
I don't know.

43:40.443 --> 43:43.882
Maybe 20, 25.

43:45.405 --> 43:47.799
The lady with the shotgun,

43:47.929 --> 43:49.278
she was trying to get people
to stay in the diner,

43:49.409 --> 43:50.453
but once the house collapsed...

43:50.584 --> 43:52.107
No, no, no.
What do you mean?

43:52.238 --> 43:53.892
What do you mean it collapsed?
Which house collapsed?

43:54.022 --> 43:56.242
The, uh,
the one next to the diner.

43:56.372 --> 43:58.200
Oh my God!

43:58.331 --> 44:00.638
Oh my God, wh-which-- town--
which way to town!?

44:00.768 --> 44:04.163
Tabitha, it's that way!
Tabitha, you--

44:27.403 --> 44:30.102
Close it. Let's go.

44:31.886 --> 44:33.845
Victor, close it!

44:33.975 --> 44:34.715
Come on.

44:42.070 --> 44:42.984
Tabitha?
