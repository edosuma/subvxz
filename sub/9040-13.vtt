YEAH, YEAH, GET A GOOD LOOK
AT THIS FACE, SUCKER,

00:59.700 --> 01:01.833
'CAUSE IT'S THE LAST TIME
IT'LL BE THE FACE

01:01.833 --> 01:03.067
OF A MAN WHO'S NEVER BEEN

01:03.067 --> 01:05.267
TO THE GREATEST PLACE
A MAN COULD GO.

01:05.267 --> 01:09.233

THEY HAVE MOUTHWASH.

01:09.233 --> 01:10.767

01:34.933 --> 01:36.033
- HEY, COME ON.

01:36.033 --> 01:37.333
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WISE

01:37.333 --> 01:42.167
TO INSULT THE MAN
WHO HAS AN EXTRA TICKET.

01:42.167 --> 01:43.633
- IF YOU'RE JACKING ME AROUND,

01:43.633 --> 01:46.067
I'M GONNA RIP
YOUR ARM OFF AT THE ELBOW.

01:46.067 --> 01:47.400
- NO JACK, DUDE.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.800
YOU AND ME LEAVING TOMORROW,
SUPER BOWL.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.700

02:27.733 --> 02:30.333
I'M JUST GONNA STAND HERE
AND WAIT THEM OUT.

02:34.167 --> 02:36.367

STILL THERE?

03:22.367 --> 03:25.100

03:25.100 --> 03:27.300
- WOULD YOU MIND
DISTRACTING THEM

03:27.300 --> 03:31.167
WITH SOME NUDITY?

03:35.867 --> 03:37.267
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

03:37.267 --> 03:39.933
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT
SUPER BOWL TICKETS?

03:39.933 --> 03:41.033
- OH, BOY.

03:41.033 --> 03:42.333
- YOU--YOU GOT
AN EXTRA TICKET

03:42.333 --> 03:45.167
TO THE SUPER BOWL...

03:45.167 --> 03:47.667
AND YOU'RE TAKING GIANNI?

03:47.667 --> 03:50.200
- THAT TICKET SHOULD BE MINE,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.333
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
FIRST OF ALL,

03:52.333 --> 03:56.133
PUT THE FORK DOWN, DAD.

03:56.133 --> 03:57.333
- I'LL PUT THE FORK DOWN

03:57.333 --> 04:00.933
WHEN THERE'S
A TICKET ON IT.

04:00.933 --> 04:03.267
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ABOUT ME?

04:03.267 --> 04:04.600
- ALL RIGHT,
THE BOTH OF YOU STOP IT.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.333
RAYMOND, YOU HAVE
TO GET TWO MORE TICKETS.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.200
- I CAN'T DO THAT, MA.
I CAN'T.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.667
- JUST CALL UP SOMEONE.
YOU WANT ME TO CALL?

04:11.667 --> 04:13.333
- WAIT, NO, MA,

04:13.333 --> 04:14.733
THERE'S NOBODY TO--
YOU CAN'T--

04:14.733 --> 04:17.933
- WHAT'S THE NUMBER
OF THE SUPER BOWL?

04:17.933 --> 04:19.767
- THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS, MA.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.167
LOOK, LISTEN.

04:21.167 --> 04:22.933
TAKING GIANNI
IS THE ONLY FAIR THING, OKAY?

04:22.933 --> 04:24.233
IF I HAD ASKED
ONE OF YOU TO GO,

04:24.233 --> 04:25.600
THEN THE OTHER ONE
WOULD HAVE BEEN MAD.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.700
- NO. YOU WOULD HAVE CHOSEN
A FAMILY MEMBER,

04:27.700 --> 04:30.100
AND THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN HONORABLE.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.500
- OH, COME ON.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.833
DAD, WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN HAPPY
IF I ASKED ROBERT TO GO?

04:34.833 --> 04:38.500
- GIVE ME MY TICKET.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.500
- OKAY, LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:40.500 --> 04:42.733
I DON'T HAVE A TICKET
FOR EITHER OF YOU.

04:42.733 --> 04:45.233
I'M SORRY, I TOLD GIANNI
I WAS GOING TO TAKE HIM,

04:45.233 --> 04:47.767
AND I'M GONNA TAKE HIM.

04:51.833 --> 04:55.500
- WELL, THAT'S THE WAY
IT SHOULD BE, I GUESS.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.633
YOU TAKE GIANNI, RAYMOND.
HAVE A GRAND TIME.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.433
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GET
ONE OF THOSE BIG

05:02.433 --> 05:05.767
NUMBER ONE FOAM FINGERS
AND WAVE IT IN THE AIR?

05:05.767 --> 05:07.700
'CAUSE YOU'RE NUMBER ONE,
RAYMOND.

05:07.700 --> 05:11.367
YOU'RE NUMBER ONE!

05:13.200 --> 05:16.033
BUT REMEMBER THIS...

05:16.033 --> 05:20.133
ONE IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER
THAT YOU'LL EVER DO.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.233
ALL RIGHT?

05:24.233 --> 05:28.600
[door opens, shuts]

05:28.600 --> 05:29.967
- ALL RIGHT,
NOW THAT HE'S GONE,

05:29.967 --> 05:32.667
GIVE ME MY TICKET.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.733
- DAD, I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

05:34.733 --> 05:37.267
- FINE! FINE!

05:37.267 --> 05:38.633
DO WHAT YOU WANT.

05:38.633 --> 05:39.900
LET ME TELL YOU THIS.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.867
I KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING
TO SAY ON MY TOMBSTONE.

05:42.867 --> 05:48.033
"MY SON WENT TO THE SUPER BOWL,
AND NOW I'M DEAD."

05:52.133 --> 05:54.100
- NO, DON'T.
DON'T, DON'T, MA.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.333
DON'T--DON'T DO IT.
- WHAT?

05:56.333 --> 05:58.767
- DON'T TRY TO GET ME
TO CHANGE MY MIND, OKAY?

05:58.767 --> 06:01.067
I SEE YOU'RE FIRING UP
ALL THE PISTONS

06:01.067 --> 06:03.200
IN YOUR LITTLE
GUILT MACHINE.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.667
- I DON'T HAVE
A GUILT MACHINE, RAYMOND.

06:06.667 --> 06:07.567
ALL I HAVE IS THE HOPE

06:07.567 --> 06:11.300
THAT OUR FAMILY
COULD BE HAPPY.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.833
- THERE'S A LOT OF MILES
ON THAT MACHINE,

06:18.833 --> 06:22.267
BUT IT RUNS LIKE NEW.

06:22.267 --> 06:23.733
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

06:23.733 --> 06:25.533
IT'S THE BEST ASSIGNMENT
I'VE EVER GOTTEN,

06:25.533 --> 06:27.067
AND I CAN'T EVEN
ENJOY IT NOW

06:27.067 --> 06:28.433
'CAUSE EVERYBODY HATES ME.

06:28.433 --> 06:29.933
- I UNDERSTAND, RAY.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:29.933 --> 06:31.333
IT'S YOUR TRIP,

06:31.333 --> 06:32.833
AND YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO TAKE YOUR FRIEND

06:32.833 --> 06:37.233
INSTEAD OF YOUR BROTHER
OR YOUR FATHER OR YOUR WIFE.

06:41.867 --> 06:43.833
- WIFE?

06:43.833 --> 06:45.267
- YEAH, WIFE.

06:45.267 --> 06:46.367
THAT'S ME, REMEMBER?

[hums "Here Comes the Bride"]

06:52.133 --> 06:54.233

[hums "Here Comes the Bride"]

06:55.567 --> 06:58.867

06:58.867 --> 07:01.400
I KNOW THAT SONG.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.233
THE HAPPIEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

07:04.233 --> 07:05.767
- YOU GET TO GO
ON THIS GREAT TRIP,

07:05.767 --> 07:07.933
AND IT NEVER EVEN OCCURRED
TO YOU TO ASK ME.

07:07.933 --> 07:12.800
- BUT...THAT'S BECAUSE
THIS IS FOOTBALL!

07:12.800 --> 07:14.700
- SO WHAT?
- OH, COME ON.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.133
IF YOU HAD TWO TICKETS

07:16.133 --> 07:20.167
TO THE POTTERY BARN
GRAND CHAMPIONSHIPS...

07:20.167 --> 07:22.167
WOULD YOU WANT TO TAKE ME?

07:22.167 --> 07:23.767
- RAY, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE FOOTBALL,

07:23.767 --> 07:25.667
BUT WHAT ABOUT US
GETTING AWAY TOGETHER?

07:25.667 --> 07:27.633
I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING
TO THIS NICE HOTEL.

07:27.633 --> 07:28.733
WE COULD HAVE DINNER--

07:28.733 --> 07:30.500
- OKAY, SEE?
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.333
I MEAN, THE HOTEL--YOU KNOW,
WITH THE PAPER'S BUDGET,

07:32.333 --> 07:33.833
IT'S PROBABLY
LIKE A HALFWAY HOUSE,

07:33.833 --> 07:36.967
AND THE FOOD'S GONNA STINK.
- YOU JUST TOLD ME

07:36.967 --> 07:38.900
THIS WAS THE GREATEST
ASSIGNMENT YOU'D EVER GOTTEN.

07:38.900 --> 07:41.167
- WELL, THAT'S THE KEY WORD,
ASSIGNMENT.

07:41.167 --> 07:42.833
NOBODY BRINGS THEIR WIVES,

07:42.833 --> 07:46.533
'CAUSE THAT WEEKEND
THEY'RE MARRIED TO THE GAME.

07:52.533 --> 07:53.867
ASSIGNMENT.

07:53.867 --> 07:55.100
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.967
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING
TO TAKE GIANNI.

07:56.967 --> 07:58.633
SO YOU SHOULD TAKE GIANNI.
- OH, I DID TELL HIM.

07:58.633 --> 08:00.100
I TOLD HIM
I WAS GOING TO TAKE HIM.

08:00.100 --> 08:02.033
- ALL RIGHT, SO JUST GO.

08:02.033 --> 08:05.333
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO GO
IF YOU'RE GONNA HATE ME.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.600
- I DON'T HATE YOU, RAY.

- OH, COME ON.
LOOK, WHEN I GET BACK,

08:08.467 --> 08:10.100

WE'LL GO SOMEWHERE.

WE NEVER GET AWAY TOGETHER.

08:12.333 --> 08:15.400
- OKAY, THEN WE WILL.
WE WILL, ALL RIGHT?

WE'LL WEAR MATCHING SWEATERS,

AND WE'LL WALK
IN THE MOUNTAINS,

08:26.333 --> 08:30.267
AND WE WON'T COME HOME
UNTIL WE FIND A RAINBOW.

08:37.967 --> 08:39.633

SHE GOT HIT IN THE HEAD
WITH A FLUTE.

- YEAH, RIGHT, RIGHT.

10:00.700 --> 10:04.967
DAMN IT, THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH, YEAH.

10:04.967 --> 10:06.400
ALTHOUGH IF YOU DID TELL HER,

10:06.400 --> 10:07.900
SHE PROBABLY WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND TOO MUCH,

10:07.900 --> 10:10.067
'CAUSE THAT FLUTE THING
BANGED HER UP PRETTY BAD.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.400
YEAH, YEAH.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.467
- HERE YOU GO, RAYMIE.
GOT YOU SPRINKLES.

10:18.633 --> 10:21.033
NO RULES.

10:31.733 --> 10:34.133
- I'M SORRY, GIANNI.

10:34.133 --> 10:37.200
- SO WHEN DOES SHE
GET HERE?

10:37.200 --> 10:39.833
- SHE'S DRIVING IN
FROM THE AIRPORT NOW, MAN.

10:39.833 --> 10:43.167
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE BRINGING HER HERE.

10:43.167 --> 10:44.767
- ALL THE GUYS
BROUGHT THEIR WIVES.

10:44.767 --> 10:47.733
SHE DESERVES
TO HAVE SOME FUN, YOU KNOW?

10:47.733 --> 10:52.167
THERE'S CRAFTS FESTIVALS
AND OUTLET STORES.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.700
LISTEN,

10:56.700 --> 10:59.333
IT'S NOT GOING
TO AFFECT US AT ALL, MAN.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.033
HUH?

11:01.033 --> 11:03.300
WE'RE STILL GONNA
GOLF ALL DAY.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.633
IT'S JUST THAT AT NIGHT,

11:04.633 --> 11:06.933
IF THERE'S A CHANCE
FOR HOTEL SEX,

11:06.933 --> 11:11.067
I'D RATHER HAVE HER
IN THE ROOM THAN YOU.

11:11.067 --> 11:14.800
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.267
- COME ON, MAN.

11:16.267 --> 11:18.633
WE STILL GET TO GO
TO THE SUPER BOWL, ALL RIGHT?

11:18.633 --> 11:20.567
ISN'T THAT WHAT
IT'S ALL ABOUT, HUH?

11:20.567 --> 11:24.033
[singing] THE SUPER BOWL,
WE'RE AT THE SUPER BOWL.

11:24.033 --> 11:26.367
- I DON'T FEEL
LIKE DANCING NOW.

11:26.367 --> 11:27.467
I GUESS
I GOT TO GO MOVE IN

11:27.467 --> 11:29.367
WITH YOUR FAT
REPORTER FRIEND.

11:29.367 --> 11:31.867
- HEY, HE'S A GOOD GUY.
MIKE REALLY IS--HE'S A GOOD GUY.

11:31.867 --> 11:33.467
- YEAH, AND WHERE AM I
GONNA END UP TOMORROW,

11:33.467 --> 11:36.667
WHEN YOU FLY IN
YOUR MOTHER?

11:36.667 --> 11:37.667
[knock at door]

11:37.667 --> 11:38.700
- COME ON, MAN.

11:38.700 --> 11:41.633
JUST BE COOL, ALL RIGHT?
JUST BE COOL.

11:41.633 --> 11:43.333
- HEY!
- HEY.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.233
- HA HA HA.
OH.

11:45.233 --> 11:47.433
HI, GIANNI.

11:47.433 --> 11:49.233
- HELLO.

11:49.233 --> 11:51.133
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

11:51.133 --> 11:53.733
- YEAH, NO, NO.
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

11:53.733 --> 11:57.267
- I'LL SEE YOU TWO LATER.
- OKAY.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.133
OH, MAN.
NOW I FEEL BAD.

12:09.133 --> 12:11.100
- NO, DON'T. HE STILL GETS
TO GO TO THE GAME ON SUNDAY,

12:11.100 --> 12:12.500
AND YOU'RE HERE.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.033
COME ON, EVERYTHING WORKS OUT
FOR EVERYBODY.

12:14.033 --> 12:15.133
- ALL RIGHT, WELL...

12:15.133 --> 12:17.033
OH, MY GOSH.
LOOK AT THIS.

12:17.033 --> 12:18.967
- YEAH, GUESS I WAS WRONG
ABOUT THE HOTEL.

12:18.967 --> 12:20.400
IT'S PRETTY NICE.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.400
- OH, GOSH, YEAH,
IT'S JUST--IT'S--

12:23.400 --> 12:26.100
OH, RAY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU FOR CALLING ME.

12:26.100 --> 12:29.333
- WELL, IT WAS WEIRD
WITHOUT YOU HERE.

12:29.333 --> 12:32.333
SO MY MOM HAD NO PROBLEM
TAKING THE KIDS?

12:32.333 --> 12:35.367
- NO. HOW LUCKY ARE WE THAT
SHE LIVES ACROSS THE STREET?

12:37.567 --> 12:39.367
- WHOA. WHOA.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.200
WHAT, WERE YOU DRINKING
ON THE PLANE?

12:41.200 --> 12:43.567
- A LITTLE BIT.

12:43.567 --> 12:46.867
SO IT IS SO WARM HERE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.767
IT'S 15 DEGREES
IN NEW YORK.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.567
- I KNOW.
HEY, UH, LISTEN,

12:50.567 --> 12:52.033
THE RESTAURANTS
ARE ALL CLOSED,

12:52.033 --> 12:54.233
BUT THEY GOT
THE 24-HOUR ROOM SERVICE

12:54.233 --> 12:56.067
IF WE WANT IT.
- UH-HUH.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.500
- OR...

12:57.500 --> 13:01.267
I COULD PUT THIS "DO NOT
DISTURB" SIGN ON THE DOOR,

13:01.267 --> 13:05.767
AND WE WOULD NOT
BE DISTURBED.

13:05.767 --> 13:07.400
- HMM.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.767
- HOLD ON, BEFORE
YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION,

13:08.767 --> 13:12.767
LET ME JUST--LET ME
THROW THIS INTO THE MIX.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.167
- COME HERE.

13:18.167 --> 13:21.367
- YOU ARE DRUNK.
- OH, YES.

13:24.133 --> 13:27.667
- RAY, YOU WANT
TO GET SOME BREAKFAST?

13:33.567 --> 13:37.200
- GOOD MORNING.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.300
- OOH, YOU LOOK NICE.

13:39.300 --> 13:43.500
- YOU SHOULD SEE ME
UP CLOSE.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.867
[knock on door]

13:44.867 --> 13:46.100
- YOO-HOO!
ANYBODY HOME?

13:46.100 --> 13:47.400
- WHO'S THAT?

13:47.400 --> 13:48.967
- OH, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S STU AND MARY JO.

13:48.967 --> 13:51.100
YEAH, LAST NIGHT I TOLD THEM
THAT YOU WERE COMING.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.733
- MARY JO IS HERE?
- YEAH, YEAH.

13:52.733 --> 13:54.700
- OH.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.100
HI!
- HI!

13:57.100 --> 14:00.600
I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME.
HOW'S YOUR EYE?

14:00.600 --> 14:03.233
- CRAFTS FESTIVAL!
WHAT'S UP?

14:03.233 --> 14:04.633
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
I TOLD THEM TO COME BY,

14:04.633 --> 14:05.900
'CAUSE THEY'RE GOING
TO THIS PLACE

14:05.900 --> 14:07.200
THAT'S RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.533
- OH, DEBRA,
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

14:08.533 --> 14:09.767
THEY HAVE THIS WHOLE
INTERNATIONAL MARKET

14:09.767 --> 14:11.100
SET UP DOWNTOWN,

14:11.100 --> 14:13.633
ARTS AND CRAFTS
FROM 50 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.

14:13.633 --> 14:14.767
- 50 COUNTRIES?

14:14.767 --> 14:17.867
I'LL BET SOME
OF THEM ARE FOREIGN.

14:17.867 --> 14:19.367
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
SO WHEN?

14:19.367 --> 14:20.567
RAY, YOU SHOULD GET READY.

14:20.567 --> 14:22.033
- OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
STU AND I

14:22.033 --> 14:23.467
GOT TO GO
TO THAT PRESS CONFERENCE,

14:23.467 --> 14:24.600
SO WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GO AHEAD? GO AHEAD.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.300
- OKAY,
SO WE'LL MEET YOU LATER?

14:26.300 --> 14:27.967
IS THERE, LIKE, AN ENTRANCE?

14:27.967 --> 14:29.500
- OH, WE WON'T BE DONE GOLFING.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.167
IN FACT, YOU GUYS SHOULD
GET DINNER ON YOUR OWN.

14:31.167 --> 14:32.433
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER.

14:32.433 --> 14:34.000
- ALL RIGHT.
I'M SURE WE CAN MANAGE.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.300
OH, DEBRA, COME ON.

14:35.300 --> 14:36.733
THE SHUTTLE'S
PROBABLY DOWN THERE.

14:36.733 --> 14:38.833
- GREAT, SO GO, YOU KNOW,
GO TCHOTCHKE CRAZY.

14:38.833 --> 14:39.933
- UH, WAIT, RAY.

14:39.933 --> 14:41.000
- WHAT?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.167
- COULD WE, UH, TALK?

14:43.167 --> 14:44.400
- DO YOU NEED TO GET READY?

14:44.400 --> 14:46.100
DO YOU WANT ME
TO HOLD THE SHUTTLE?

14:46.100 --> 14:48.033
- YEAH. DO YOU WANT HER
TO HOLD THE SHUTTLE?

14:48.033 --> 14:49.300
- NO, RAY.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.400
- YOU WANT TO TAKE
THE NEXT SHUTTLE?

14:51.400 --> 14:53.300
'CAUSE, WHAT, THEY LEAVE,
LIKE, EVERY HALF HOUR, RIGHT?

14:53.300 --> 14:57.167
- I'M NOT GETTING
ON ANY SHUTTLE.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.900
- YEAH.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.800
SHE WAS ON A SHUTTLE ONCE,

15:04.800 --> 15:08.800
AND SOMEONE, UM...

15:08.800 --> 15:12.233
CALLED HER FAT.

15:12.233 --> 15:14.967
- WELL, MAYBE DEBRA CAN
CATCH UP WITH US LATER.

15:14.967 --> 15:16.300
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.967
- I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

15:17.967 --> 15:21.500
- RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

15:31.167 --> 15:32.833
DON'T YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE CRAFTS PLACE?

15:32.833 --> 15:33.867
- BY MYSELF?

15:33.867 --> 15:35.367
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:35.367 --> 15:37.167
ALL THE WIVES ARE GOING.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS HERE.

15:37.167 --> 15:39.033
EVERY DAY THE LADIES
DO SOMETHING REALLY COOL.

15:39.033 --> 15:41.167
- WHILE THE MEN GOLF.

15:41.167 --> 15:43.900
- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS HERE.

15:43.900 --> 15:47.033
- AND WHEN ARE WE TOGETHER, RAY?
DOES THAT HAPPEN HERE?

15:47.033 --> 15:48.800
- NO, I'M GONNA SEE YOU
TONIGHT, RIGHT?

15:48.800 --> 15:53.233
AND THEN IT'S GONNA
REALLY HAPPEN.

15:53.233 --> 15:54.567
COME ON.
WHY AREN'T YOU HAPPY?

15:54.567 --> 15:56.100
I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD LIKE THIS.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.767
- WELL, I CAN SEE
WHY YOU LIKE IT, RAY,

15:57.767 --> 16:01.867
BECAUSE LET ME SEE IF
I GET THIS ITINERARY CORRECT.

16:01.867 --> 16:03.400
UM, IN THE MORNING,

16:03.400 --> 16:04.967
YOU DROP ME OFF
AT WIVES' DAY CAMP,

16:04.967 --> 16:10.767
AND THEN AT NIGHT, I GET
TO BE YOUR SUPER BOWL WHORE.

16:10.767 --> 16:16.067
- WOW. TALK ABOUT PUTTING
A BAD SPIN ON IT.

16:16.067 --> 16:18.000
- WELL, HOW WOULD YOU
DESCRIBE IT, RAY?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.367
- IT'S FUN.

16:19.367 --> 16:21.167
I'M HAVING FUN,
AND YOU'RE HAVING FUN.

16:21.167 --> 16:23.733
WHY YOU GOT TO GET
ALL POTTY-MOUTHED?

16:23.733 --> 16:27.900
- SORRY. MY PIMP TOLD ME
YOU LIKED IT ROUGH.

16:27.900 --> 16:28.967
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:28.967 --> 16:30.500
COME ON,
WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

16:30.500 --> 16:32.600
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THIS WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.600
- WILL YOU PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS?

16:34.600 --> 16:37.500
- THAT MAKES IT EVEN WORSE.
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT!

16:37.500 --> 16:41.233
- NO, NO. I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT? I'M HERE.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.067
I'M AT THE SUPER BOWL
WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.300
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME...

16:44.300 --> 16:46.100
WITH YOUR BLESSING,
MIND YOU,

16:46.100 --> 16:47.133
AND THEN I SEE
THE OTHER WIVES ARE HERE,

16:47.133 --> 16:48.433
AND THEY'RE HAVING FUN.

16:48.433 --> 16:50.567
AND I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WOULD HAVE FUN TOO.

16:50.567 --> 16:52.600
I REALLY DID, I REALLY THOUGHT
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE IT.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.867
INSTEAD,
YOU'RE YELLING AT ME.

16:53.867 --> 16:55.133
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

16:55.133 --> 16:59.900
YOU WEREN'T EVEN
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.867
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

17:02.867 --> 17:08.233
- WHAT, THE WHOLE THING?

17:08.233 --> 17:10.700
- NO, JUST THAT LAST THING.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.433
- OH. WHATEVER THAT WAS,
THAT WASN'T THE LAST THING,

17:13.433 --> 17:15.167
'CAUSE THE LAST THING
WAS GOING TO BE,

17:15.167 --> 17:19.500
"I'M SORRY AND I'M STUPID."

17:19.500 --> 17:22.500
OH. OH.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.967
COME ON.

17:27.967 --> 17:31.800
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

17:31.800 --> 17:33.100
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:33.100 --> 17:36.067
YOU NEVER MAKE PLANS
WITH ME.

17:36.067 --> 17:38.033
WE HARDLY SPEND
ANY TIME TOGETHER,

17:38.033 --> 17:39.667
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO BOTHER YOU.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.067
THE LAST THING WE DID
TOGETHER, WHAT WAS IT?

17:42.067 --> 17:44.333
UH, OH, WE STOPPED
AT A DRIVE-THROUGH

17:44.333 --> 17:46.133
ON THE WAY HOME FROM ME
TAKING YOU TO THE DOCTOR

17:46.133 --> 17:47.500
TO GET YOUR EAR DRAINED.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.133
- THAT'S RIGHT.
WE HAD THOSE GREAT TACOS.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.767
- LOOK, I KNOW THAT
THIS IS THE SUPER BOWL,

17:55.767 --> 17:59.133
BUT IT'S JUST...

17:59.133 --> 18:01.200
I WAS SO HAPPY
ON THE PLANE RIDE OVER HERE

18:01.200 --> 18:03.433
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT YOU--

18:03.433 --> 18:06.400
OH, YOU KNOW, FORGET IT.
I'M GONNA GO HOME.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.367
- NO. NO, NO. YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GO HOME.

18:08.367 --> 18:10.367
NO, LOOK, I'M NOT
GONNA GO GOLFING.

18:10.367 --> 18:12.267
I'LL GO TO THE PRESS CONFERENCE,
AND YOU AND I GET

18:12.267 --> 18:13.633
THE FIRST SHUTTLE
TO THE 50 COUNTRIES.

18:13.633 --> 18:14.967
- NO, RAY.

18:14.967 --> 18:17.200
- NO, COME ON, I WANT TO.
WE'RE GONNA DO THAT.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.533
AND AFTER THAT,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE DINNER,

18:18.533 --> 18:22.600
AND THEN AFTER THAT, NO SEX.
YOU DESERVE IT.

18:25.433 --> 18:27.700
- DOING THAT
BECAUSE YOU FEEL BAD

18:27.700 --> 18:29.367
IS NOT WHAT I WANTED.

18:29.367 --> 18:32.100
- LISTEN, NO.
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG, OKAY?

18:32.100 --> 18:33.867
I WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

18:33.867 --> 18:35.133
- WELL, YOU'LL HAVE
A GOOD 20 MINUTES

18:35.133 --> 18:36.500
WHEN YOU TAKE ME
TO THE AIRPORT.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.533
- WELL, LOOK,
THAT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.000
WILL YOU STOP PACKING, PLEASE?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.333
COME ON, WE'RE GONNA
HANG OUT TODAY.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.533
WE'RE GONNA HANG OUT
TOMORROW TOO,

18:41.533 --> 18:43.100
AND WE'RE GONNA
HANG OUT SUNDAY.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.700
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO GO
TO THE SUPER BOWL!

18:44.700 --> 18:46.033
- WHAT?

18:46.033 --> 18:48.400
- LISTEN, I KNOW IT'S HARD
FOR YOU TO BELIEVE ME,

18:48.400 --> 18:50.333
BUT I LIKE SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU, AND I MEAN IT.

18:50.333 --> 18:53.267
I WON'T GO--I WILL NOT GO
TO THE SUPER BOWL.

18:53.267 --> 18:54.767
- ALL RIGHT, I GET
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.400
- I'M NOT TRYING, ALL RIGHT?
I'M GONNA DO IT.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.667
I'M GONNA RIP UP THE TICKETS.
WHERE ARE THEY?

18:58.667 --> 18:59.933
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

18:59.933 --> 19:01.200
- YOU DON'T THINK SO, RIGHT?

19:01.200 --> 19:02.900
YOU THINK I'M PLAYING?
ALL RIGHT.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.867
JUST LET ME FIND THEM.

19:04.867 --> 19:06.367
HERE THEY ARE.
HERE THEY ARE.

19:06.367 --> 19:07.800
- ALL RIGHT,
I GET IT, RAY.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.467
- NO, NO, YOU DON'T GET IT.
THERE YOU GO!

19:09.467 --> 19:10.833
- STOP!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:10.833 --> 19:12.133
- I DON'T STOP IT, BABY.
I KEEP GOING, SEE?

19:12.133 --> 19:13.467
OH, MAYBE YOU THINK

19:13.467 --> 19:15.300
I COULD SCOTCH-TAPE THEM
BACK TOGETHER, OKAY.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.700
- NO. RAY, DON'T!

19:16.700 --> 19:20.100
- NOW I CAN'T. SEE?
WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.433
HERE'S TWO LITTLE PIECES
THAT FELL.

19:21.433 --> 19:22.867
MAYBE I CAN GET IN
WITH JUST THESE PIECES.

19:22.867 --> 19:26.733
YOU THINK SO?
[mumbles] I DON'T THINK SO.

19:41.800 --> 19:45.000
ALL GONE.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.033
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT.

19:47.033 --> 19:49.067
- I LOVE YOU.

19:49.067 --> 19:50.633
- WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME?

19:50.633 --> 19:52.233
- COME ON!
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPY!

19:52.233 --> 19:54.333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HITTING ISN'T HAPPY.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.133
- WHY WOULD YOU RIP UP
THE SUPER BOWL TICKETS?

19:56.133 --> 19:57.467
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GIVE UP THE SUPER BOWL.

19:57.467 --> 19:59.367
HOW SELFISH
DO YOU THINK I AM?

19:59.367 --> 20:00.833
YOU LOVE THE SUPER BOWL!

20:00.833 --> 20:02.300
- THAT'S THE POINT
I'M TRYING TO MAKE.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.200
I LOVE YOU
MORE THAN THE SUPER BOWL!

20:04.200 --> 20:05.567
- THE OFFER
WOULD'VE BEEN ENOUGH.

20:05.567 --> 20:07.233
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,
I'M GONNA BE KNOWN

20:07.233 --> 20:09.600
AS THE WIFE WHO MADE YOU
EAT YOUR SUPER BOWL TICKETS!

20:09.600 --> 20:11.367
- NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

20:11.367 --> 20:13.200
I ONLY ATE THE TICKETS
SO YOU COULD BE HAPPY.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.400
YOU HAVE TO BE HAPPY!

20:14.400 --> 20:16.267
- NOBODY TOLD YOU
TO DO THAT!

20:16.267 --> 20:17.667
- THAT'S RIGHT!
THAT'S THE GOOD PART!

20:17.667 --> 20:19.133
I WANT TO SPEND TIME
WITH YOU!

20:19.133 --> 20:20.467
- AND I WANT TO SPEND TIME
WITH YOU!

20:20.467 --> 20:24.233
- WELL, WE GOT
PLENTY OF TIME NOW!

20:39.500 --> 20:44.600
NOW I'M A LITTLE UNHAPPY.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.100
- WHAT ABOUT GIANNI?

20:46.100 --> 20:47.167
YOU RIPPED UP
HIS TICKET TOO.

20:47.167 --> 20:50.700
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA TELL HIM?

20:54.033 --> 20:57.567
THAT YOU MADE ME DO IT.

21:02.633 --> 21:04.533
- SECOND DOWN AND NINE.

21:04.533 --> 21:07.167
[cheering]
NEAR THE 35.

21:07.167 --> 21:09.500
JUST OVER NINE MINUTES
TO GO IN THE QUARTER

21:09.500 --> 21:12.833
AND THEY NEED
TO SCORE ON THIS DRIVE.

21:12.833 --> 21:16.500
LOOKING FOR THE BLITZ
THAT HE KNOWS IS COMING.

21:16.500 --> 21:20.167
AND IT IS!
