04:49.500 --> 04:52.019
Shuttlesworth!
Shuttlesworth!

05:01.261 --> 05:04.901
- What's up, bro?
- Game's over. Warden wants to see you.

05:04.980 --> 05:07.461
The warden?
What's this all about?

05:07.540 --> 05:10.020
Don't know nothin'.
Don't wanna know nothin'.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.860
He tells me to get you,
so I get you.

05:27.941 --> 05:31.141
Thank you, Books.
You may wait outside.

05:34.181 --> 05:37.101
Jake, please sit down.
Sit down.

05:39.781 --> 05:42.942
I was told you were
on the court.

05:43.021 --> 05:45.583
Yes, sir.
I try to stay fit, trim.

05:45.662 --> 05:48.903
You know, everything like that.
Keep my mind occupied.

05:48.983 --> 05:52.662
As you already know, you've picked
the perfect recreation.

05:52.702 --> 05:55.141
Dr. James Naismith
knew what he was doin'.

05:55.222 --> 05:58.783
- It's a great game, isn't it?
- Basketball, yes.

05:58.823 --> 06:01.903
- You played some?
- Uh, yes, sir, when I was younger.

06:01.943 --> 06:04.382
- You know, I put in a little work.
- I coach my son's team.

06:04.462 --> 06:06.382
I ran a neighborhood center.

06:06.463 --> 06:08.822
Let's go. Show me that.
Oh, good!

06:08.862 --> 06:11.862
That's good, but you crossed over.
You still bailed out.

06:11.943 --> 06:14.343
- You coached?
- Nah, nothing like that there.

06:14.424 --> 06:17.743
You know, I see somebody out there,
a little kid who needs some help.

06:17.782 --> 06:20.023
I work with him,
give him a few tips.

06:20.062 --> 06:21.463
- Which hand did you shoot with?
- Right.

06:21.543 --> 06:22.702
- Which hand are you
supposed to be shooting with?
- Left.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.143
But nowadays, uh,
Warden, they--

06:25.223 --> 06:28.024
these kids ain't gonna listen
to nothin' you say, you know.

06:28.104 --> 06:29.943
They think they know it all.

06:30.024 --> 06:32.344
All they wanna do is dunk and--
you know, everything like that.

06:32.385 --> 06:35.303
Their fundamentals is, uh--
is, like, sorely lacking.

06:35.384 --> 06:37.463
That's strange.
I haven't had that problem yet.

06:37.543 --> 06:39.504
Yeah, well, you--

06:39.584 --> 06:41.584
The kids are smart.

06:41.664 --> 06:44.904
They know they don't listen to you,
they end up in here with me.

06:44.944 --> 06:48.025
I never thought about it like that.

06:48.104 --> 06:50.745
Did you vote for Governor Pernell?

06:50.824 --> 06:52.664
Uh, nah, I ain't never voted.

06:52.744 --> 06:56.064
No matter. What does matter
is Governor is a big,

06:56.144 --> 06:59.105
huge, fanatical
basketball fan.

06:59.185 --> 07:02.345
He played himself--
four years, varsity, at Big State.

07:02.426 --> 07:05.345
Good, not great athlete.

07:05.385 --> 07:08.985
He's the biggest supporter
Big State has. Bleeds red and white.

07:09.064 --> 07:12.224
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I saw
something like that about him on TV.

07:12.304 --> 07:15.625
Do you have a son named
Jesus Shuttlesworth?

07:15.706 --> 07:16.745
Yes, sir.

07:16.785 --> 07:19.785
Is your son considered the number one
high school prospect...

07:19.865 --> 07:22.505
in these United States
of America?

07:22.545 --> 07:25.026
Some people rate him
that high, some don't.

07:25.105 --> 07:28.386
- You know, two, three, six.
- Come on, Jake. Come on.

07:28.466 --> 07:31.386
Don't be modest. You oughta be proud.
You oughta be proud as a peacock.

07:31.466 --> 07:34.705
I always been proud of my son even
before he was the number one prospect...

07:34.786 --> 07:36.866
in the whole entire world.

07:36.946 --> 07:40.065
- You aren't modest, after all.
- God is working with me on that, sir.

07:40.146 --> 07:44.267
The governor's made a request
that your son, Jesus Shuttlesworth,

07:44.347 --> 07:47.948
seriously consider enrolling
in his alma mater, Big State.

07:48.026 --> 07:50.386
If you persuade your son
to do this,

07:50.466 --> 07:52.666
the governor's given me
his word...

07:52.746 --> 07:55.227
he'll do everything
in his power to...

07:55.306 --> 07:57.907
cut your time here short,
considerably.

07:57.947 --> 07:59.827
The governor can do that?
He can--

07:59.908 --> 08:03.187
- He can do that.
- I'm lookin' at 15, Warden. I mean--

08:03.266 --> 08:05.107
This is for real, right?

08:05.187 --> 08:08.347
You can make the governor
very happy.

08:08.427 --> 08:12.787
He's got a great reputation
for never forgetting anyone
who's done right by him.

08:12.868 --> 08:15.787
He's also never forgiven anyone
who's done him wrong.

08:15.867 --> 08:18.788
Can't do nothin' in here, though.
I mean, behind these--

08:18.868 --> 08:22.067
Behind these bars, you know,
these walls and everything like that,

08:22.147 --> 08:25.867
I mean, something
like this here...

08:25.907 --> 08:28.109
can't be worked out
over the phone or--

08:28.149 --> 08:30.507
We have to get started right away.

08:30.588 --> 08:34.707
The NC two - A deadline for kids
to declare is one week away.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.188
- One week?
- Seven days.

08:36.268 --> 08:37.549
Everything's been arranged.

08:37.629 --> 08:40.148
- It's all been worked out.
- The Bulls ain't got nothin',

08:40.229 --> 08:41.788
especially against
the Knicks.

08:41.869 --> 08:45.109
All you ever talk about is
Jordan this, Jordan that.

08:47.589 --> 08:49.670
Guard!

08:49.748 --> 08:53.189
You do your part, you deliver your son,

08:53.269 --> 08:54.948
- Guard!
- Governor Pernell will do his part.

08:55.029 --> 08:57.828
- Guard!
- What the hell's goin' on in there?

08:57.868 --> 09:00.149
You'll have to excuse
the temporary discomfort,

09:00.190 --> 09:02.469
but we can't trust
in your abilities as an actor.

09:02.550 --> 09:04.630
There's little margin
for error.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.789
Let's go, Doc!
Hurry up.

09:06.869 --> 09:09.030
Where you takin' him?

09:10.389 --> 09:12.669
- What's wrong with this inmate?
- I don't know.

09:12.709 --> 09:14.550
- Food poisoning?
- Are you sure?

09:14.630 --> 09:16.831
I don't know.
He just rolled him in.

09:16.910 --> 09:19.710
I want this inmate
quarantined immediately.

09:19.790 --> 09:22.949
- Looks like he ate some
of this fine prison cuisine.
- I can't take a chance.

09:22.989 --> 09:25.830
Last time something like this happened,
half the prison population got sick.

09:25.871 --> 09:28.751
- He's quarantined now. He's contagious.
- God!

09:28.791 --> 09:30.830
One last thing.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.951
Don't try any funny business.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.989
Any shenanigans, the deal is off.

09:34.989 --> 09:35.590
Any shenanigans, the deal is off.

09:35.670 --> 09:37.911
Can't you make him shut up?

09:37.950 --> 09:40.110
- The guy's in pain.
- Then give him something.

09:40.151 --> 09:43.431
We got two more hours to go.
Man, I don't wanna hear that shit.

09:43.511 --> 09:45.590
Two parole officers
will be assigned to you.

09:45.671 --> 09:48.192
- Spivey, he's a black man.

09:48.271 --> 09:50.230
You should like him.
He should like you.

09:50.311 --> 09:52.471
Your other chaperone is Crudup.

09:52.551 --> 09:55.392
Quiet. But, as my father told me,
it's the quiet one's you have to watch.

09:55.430 --> 09:57.511
Spivey, I'm sick
as a dog, man.

09:57.551 --> 10:01.032
Here. Drink that.

10:01.112 --> 10:03.231
Drink it.

10:04.632 --> 10:06.631
Spivey and Crudup,

10:06.711 --> 10:08.831
two of the best,
handpicked by me.

10:08.911 --> 10:13.071
If necessary, these men have
been given a green light to shoot.

10:13.151 --> 10:17.073
We don't give a shit about you,
or you being sick as a dog.

10:17.152 --> 10:20.073
You wanna throw up, let us know.
We'll pull over.

10:20.151 --> 10:24.472
You puke back there,
my main man Crudup will see to it...

10:24.552 --> 10:26.872
that you lick it
all back up,

10:26.952 --> 10:29.592
every single
nasty-ass drop.

10:30.792 --> 10:33.273
You understand,
my brother? Capisce?

10:33.353 --> 10:36.353
Yeah, capisce.
Can you pull over?

10:36.433 --> 10:38.392
Please?

10:44.593 --> 10:47.353
Remember what my main man Spivey said.
Don't get any in the car.

10:47.433 --> 10:50.832
- Not a drop, not a speck.

10:51.993 --> 10:54.714
- Don't move too fast
- What up?

10:54.793 --> 10:58.112
- Let's keep control
- What's up, bro?

11:01.795 --> 11:03.833
He's always singin'.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.234
- You know, right?
- Yo, I sound good though, man.

11:06.314 --> 11:08.833
Better take this court over, yo.

11:08.914 --> 11:11.354
- We gotta play for real.
- And don't be confused

11:11.393 --> 11:14.834
You just have
to be willing

11:14.874 --> 11:17.874
- Willing to end the-- Aw!
- Shit!

11:17.955 --> 11:21.234
Check out Rodman here.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.955
Hey, yo, yo, yo!
We got next!

11:23.034 --> 11:26.315
- Gonna kick these motherfuckers' ass.
- For real.

11:26.354 --> 11:29.035
Play ball!

11:29.115 --> 11:30.715
Big man.

11:30.795 --> 11:33.795
- Look at the pants on that kid, man.
- Let's go, baby.

11:33.835 --> 11:36.475
- That's off.
- Break!

11:36.514 --> 11:38.915
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, G!

11:40.675 --> 11:43.075
Hey!

11:45.756 --> 11:48.396
- Bring it on now.
- Move it by yourself. Come on.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.516
- Block it.
- Whoa!

11:51.556 --> 11:53.076
Aw, shit!

11:53.156 --> 11:54.836
- I got it.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.035
Come on! I'm open.

11:58.876 --> 12:02.636
- Ah, that's our ball.
- Nice shot, Johnny!

12:02.716 --> 12:04.916
Whoo-hoo!
Good pass, James!

12:07.596 --> 12:09.996
- Just let me know.
- What's the score?

12:10.075 --> 12:12.516
Let's go, Boog!

12:12.557 --> 12:14.437
I got it.

12:33.597 --> 12:36.637
I got hops, baby! I got hops.

12:36.718 --> 12:39.357
Center court.

12:39.397 --> 12:41.277
You got it. You got it.

12:44.797 --> 12:48.437
- Let's go, Boogs.
- Come on, baby. Let's go, baby.

12:48.517 --> 12:51.077
Get ready to help out, Booger,
before we get beat. Just steal.

12:51.157 --> 12:52.477
Show me something, kid.

12:52.517 --> 12:55.758
I got it! All the way!
Fly! Alley-oop!

12:55.797 --> 12:58.957
Show time!

12:59.039 --> 13:02.718
Yeah! We're the Lincoln Railsplitters,
baby! What, what, what, what?

13:02.797 --> 13:05.239
You didn't read the paper
that day, son?

13:05.319 --> 13:08.679
Aw! Railsplitters!
That's right.

13:08.759 --> 13:11.479
So Jesus
has led the Railsplitters...

13:11.559 --> 13:14.079
to the Promised Land despite
being down late the second half.

13:14.119 --> 13:16.919
Coach Cincotta's team
refused to die.

13:16.999 --> 13:20.440
They come back to win it,
and there's bedlam at the Garden.

13:20.519 --> 13:22.519
Number one.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.758
The game brings me
love, peace and happiness.

13:30.039 --> 13:32.240
My name is Sip Rodgers.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.439
I go to Abraham Lincoln High School.

13:34.519 --> 13:36.359
I play the two-spot.

13:36.439 --> 13:39.119
We're the Railsplitters,
and nobody's fuckin' with us.

13:41.119 --> 13:43.919
Basketball is like
poetry in motion.

13:43.999 --> 13:46.800
Just comin' down the court,
you got a defender in your way.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.680
You take him to the left.
You take him back to the right.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.920
And he's fallin' back,
and you just "J" right in his face.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.519
And then you look at him,
and then you say, "What?"

13:57.600 --> 13:59.921
Basketball's the birthplace
of all of my dreams,

14:00.001 --> 14:03.520
of everything that I wanna be, of
everything I wanna accomplish in life.

14:06.041 --> 14:09.120
I feel handsome when I'm on the court.
I feel like I'm somebody.

14:25.202 --> 14:27.200
The way this goes down
is simple

14:27.280 --> 14:29.882
From this day forth
anything dealing with rap stay off

14:29.962 --> 14:32.562
This the play-offs
No payoffs, strictly skills

14:32.641 --> 14:34.922
If your brain's insane
then stick to your deals

14:35.001 --> 14:37.802
In this field it ain't about sellin'
a mil wit' the run of the mill

14:37.881 --> 14:41.561
So just be tellin' it real, it ain't
like a third-time felon's appeal

14:41.601 --> 14:43.961
Till a god schools 'em
and tells 'em the deal

14:44.041 --> 14:46.283
I'll allow you to write
maybe allow you to bite

14:46.323 --> 14:48.762
If you down to fight the power
here's the power to fight

14:48.842 --> 14:51.562
I overpower the mic
Hit the crowd wit' da bomb diggy

14:51.602 --> 14:53.562
Ring the alarm
Now the squad's wit' me

14:53.642 --> 14:55.841
From way back I shown no weakness
when I speak this

14:55.922 --> 14:58.402
Mentally strong to keep this hit
and my speech is given

14:58.442 --> 15:00.682
Now listen from the beginnin'
till I reach the endin'

15:00.762 --> 15:02.883
My short story's winnin'
and keep the beat spinnin'

15:02.963 --> 15:06.083
You know the name, P.E.
You know the game, P.E.

15:06.163 --> 15:09.043
We ain't for the fame
We for the change

15:09.122 --> 15:11.882
Word is Bond, I wake up every day
wit' my game face on

15:11.963 --> 15:15.483
You know the name, P.E.
You know the game, P.E.

15:15.563 --> 15:18.602
We ain't for the fame
We for the change

15:18.683 --> 15:21.642
Word is Bond, I wake up every day
wit' my game face on

15:21.723 --> 15:23.603
We back harder than ever
Follow my lead

15:23.644 --> 15:25.083
Through the fast lane
in the game

15:25.163 --> 15:27.803
This is Mr. Shuttlesworth.
His key?

15:27.883 --> 15:31.124
You ain't ready to get it, I don't
know why they keep askin' for it

15:31.204 --> 15:33.403
Is this guy gonna mean
any trouble?

15:33.484 --> 15:36.325
Nah, he's not
gonna mean any trouble.

15:36.365 --> 15:39.244
If you somewhat sure
Hip-hop's like a chess game

15:39.324 --> 15:42.444
Discussing the war, strategize
Move like masterminds

15:42.483 --> 15:45.764
- So where y'all stayin' at?
- Marriott, mid-town Manhattan.

15:45.844 --> 15:48.445
That's what I figured. Why aren't
I stayin' down there with y'all?

15:48.524 --> 15:51.005
Only place
on Coney lsland, my man.

15:51.086 --> 15:54.124
Why waste all that valuable time
commuting back and forth...

15:54.205 --> 15:56.684
when you can walk
to see your son right from here?

15:56.764 --> 15:59.043
You also don't have a choice.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.325
The way I see it, this is better
than your room at the hoosegow.

16:02.364 --> 16:05.044
- This is the Ritz to you.
- I ain't mad at nobody.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.565
You understand
what I'm sayin'?

16:08.885 --> 16:12.005
Yeah. Yeah, this is
better than the Marriott.

16:13.165 --> 16:16.325
Keep your hands still.
There you go.

16:16.406 --> 16:18.766
- All right. Sit down.
- Huh?

16:18.805 --> 16:22.206
You heard what the fuck I said.
I said sit down!

16:22.286 --> 16:26.165
There's a couple of things
I think we better go over.

16:26.245 --> 16:28.405
Number one:
You ain't on vacation.

16:28.486 --> 16:30.367
You're not a free man.

16:30.448 --> 16:33.765
In the eyes of the law,
you are still a convicted felon.

16:33.846 --> 16:36.925
Your ass is ours.
You understand that?

16:38.127 --> 16:40.446
- Do you?
- Yeah, I over-stand it.

16:40.526 --> 16:43.326
- Then answer us when we speak to you.
- I understand it, over-stand it.

16:43.406 --> 16:45.766
The sooner you do
what you gonna do,

16:45.807 --> 16:49.167
the better it will be
for all concerned parties.

16:49.246 --> 16:52.046
Mr. Shuttlesworth,
you are now wired.

16:54.367 --> 16:59.247
It's a letter of intent
for your son to sign. Take it.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.807
In here there's some money.
Get some clothing.

17:01.887 --> 17:05.887
Toothpaste, deodorant,
personal effects, whatever have you.

17:05.968 --> 17:08.886
Take a shower. Wash your ass.

17:10.686 --> 17:12.567
Give me your right leg.

17:12.646 --> 17:17.248
Just in case you get any smart ideas,
we will track you down.

17:17.329 --> 17:19.887
And when we find you,
we will shoot you dead.

17:19.969 --> 17:21.847
- You have to check in with us daily.

17:21.887 --> 17:25.127
Plus, when we page you, you have to
return our call within ten minutes...

17:25.167 --> 17:27.247
or there's gonna be
hell to pay.

17:27.328 --> 17:30.249
Yeah. So y'all gonna be
following me everywhere I go?

17:30.329 --> 17:32.768
No, we're not gonna
follow you.

17:32.849 --> 17:36.809
We're gonna get you a passport,
plane ticket and a VlSA card.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.167
Of course we're gonna be around.
What the fuck you think we're gonna do?

17:40.248 --> 17:45.168
- So how long I got exactly?
- You got till midnight Sunday.

17:45.249 --> 17:48.529
- I guess I better get working.
- That would be the best thing to do.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.689
And we will see you tomorrow.

17:50.769 --> 17:52.969
-Yeah, I bet you will.
- How's the tummy?

17:53.049 --> 17:55.849
Great. Everything's lovely.
Nice seein' you gentlemen.

17:55.928 --> 17:57.849
- Just in case.
- Thank you.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.649
It's open.

18:17.211 --> 18:19.249
Shit.

18:40.970 --> 18:42.811
Thank you, Jesus.

18:59.970 --> 19:01.252
Thank you.

19:01.332 --> 19:04.053
If man is the father
the son is the center of the Earth

19:04.132 --> 19:06.011
In the middle
of the universe

19:06.051 --> 19:08.931
Then why is this verse
coming six times rehearsed

19:08.972 --> 19:11.411
Don't freestyle much
but I write 'em like such

19:11.491 --> 19:13.611
Amongst the themes
controlled by the screens

19:13.691 --> 19:16.173
What does it all mean
all this shit I'm seein'

19:16.253 --> 19:18.652
Human bein's
screamin' vocal javelins

19:18.733 --> 19:20.932
Sign of a local nigga
unravelin'

19:20.972 --> 19:23.373
My wanderin'
got my ass wonderin'

19:23.452 --> 19:25.732
Where Christ is
in all this crisis

19:25.812 --> 19:28.213
Hating Satan
never knew what nice is

19:28.253 --> 19:30.692
Check the papers
while I bet on ices

19:30.773 --> 19:33.133
More than your eyes can see
and ears can hear

19:33.173 --> 19:35.573
-Year by year all sense disappears
- Know y'all did your homework.

19:35.613 --> 19:37.492
- Nonsense perseveres
Prayers laced with fear
- What's up?

19:37.533 --> 19:39.573
Beware: two triple-0
is near

19:39.652 --> 19:41.773
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'

19:41.853 --> 19:43.813
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothin'

19:43.893 --> 19:45.813
- What's up?
- What is game, who got game

19:45.853 --> 19:48.053
- I saw you running.

19:48.093 --> 19:49.813
Don't even try to play it off.

19:49.894 --> 19:52.093
If you would've been on time,
there would've been no need to run.

19:52.174 --> 19:54.814
- The bus would've come sooner,
I would've been on it.
- I didn't tell you?

19:54.893 --> 19:57.533
The B-36 don't come
until I get here, Lala.

19:57.574 --> 20:00.653
You know I got it like that.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.934
Why you gonna play me
like that?

20:03.014 --> 20:05.775
- You played yourself, faded yourself.
- That's crazy.

20:05.854 --> 20:07.974
Oh?

20:08.014 --> 20:10.333
You're lucky the bus is here,
late like you.

20:10.414 --> 20:11.894
People use
Even murders excused

20:11.975 --> 20:15.133
So, uh, have you narrowed down
your choices yet?

20:15.173 --> 20:17.054
Not yet.

20:17.054 --> 20:19.095
You gonna let me in
on your secret?

20:19.175 --> 20:22.175
You know I'll never keep
anything from you, never.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.935
Folks don't even
own themselves

20:24.975 --> 20:29.214
Anyway, there's this guy
that I know that I want you to meet.

20:29.255 --> 20:31.894
Who's the guy?

20:31.935 --> 20:35.455
He's a friend of the family.
His name is D'Andre Mackey.

20:35.535 --> 20:39.015
- What does he do?
- D'Andre's an agent.

20:39.096 --> 20:43.455
You know I ain't supposed to be talking
to no agent. That shit is illegal.

20:43.495 --> 20:46.576
All he wants to do is talk to you for
five minutes, see where your head is at.

20:46.656 --> 20:48.895
My head is on my shoulders
and gonna stay there.

20:48.936 --> 20:51.336
I'm not fucking
with no agents, Lala.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.295
Who got game
Where's the game in life

20:53.376 --> 20:55.256
Jesus, please?

20:55.296 --> 20:57.176
I got game
She got game

20:57.217 --> 20:59.576
- Please?
- They got game, he got game

20:59.656 --> 21:02.137
Come on. He's a friend
of the family.

21:02.216 --> 21:04.217
- Five minutes of your time.
- So?

21:04.297 --> 21:07.896
It's just five minutes of your time
before you make your decision.

21:10.296 --> 21:12.136
Come on. Please?

21:12.177 --> 21:14.576
I don't know.

21:14.617 --> 21:16.977
Let me think about it.

21:17.056 --> 21:19.896
-I'll see you fourth period, all right?
-Sounds good.

21:19.977 --> 21:22.137
Mmm. Mmm.

21:23.697 --> 21:26.457
- I'll be so happy
when this stuff is over with.
- It won't be long now.

21:26.537 --> 21:29.936
What do you got? A Monday morning
10:00 a.m. press conference, right?

21:30.017 --> 21:32.697
- Yeah.
- Have you made a decision yet?

21:32.738 --> 21:36.537
You know what?
That's the thing that's bothering me.

21:36.577 --> 21:39.257
And you know what? You're my coach,
right? I mean, I don't mind.

21:39.297 --> 21:42.617
Every time I walk down the hallways,
"Where you goin'?

21:42.697 --> 21:46.458
Where you goin'? Have you chosen a
school yet? Are you going to the NBA?"

21:46.538 --> 21:48.379
I'm gonna tell y'all
Monday morning.

21:48.457 --> 21:51.018
- I'm tired of hearing that.
- I can understand that.

21:51.098 --> 21:53.938
Look, maybe it's in your best interest
to take it as a compliment.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.858
People really do care about you.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.138
People don't care about me.

21:58.177 --> 22:01.459
They care about themselves.

22:01.499 --> 22:04.458
They're just tryin' to get over, tryin'
to get a piece of Jesus, that's all.

22:04.498 --> 22:06.379
Not everybody's a scumbag.

22:06.459 --> 22:10.097
Some are-- don't get me wrong--
but not everybody. Okay?

22:10.138 --> 22:12.299
When are you gonna make
a decision?

22:12.379 --> 22:15.577
Sometime between now and
Monday morning, 10:00 a.m.

22:15.658 --> 22:18.459
I still have a lot of thinking to do.
I have to weigh my options.

22:18.540 --> 22:20.859
- You got my home phone number, right?
-Yeah, I got it.

22:20.939 --> 22:24.658
You call me anytime.
I don't care how late it gets,
you wanna talk this thing through.

22:24.739 --> 22:27.778
Jesus, I always thought of you
as a son. You know that, right?

22:27.859 --> 22:29.739
Yeah, I know that too.

22:29.778 --> 22:32.300
You remember what I told you?
You remember?

22:32.380 --> 22:36.699
- I remember. You tell me every day.
- What? What did I say?

22:36.780 --> 22:39.060
I know what you told me, Coach.
I know, I know.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.419
It'll make me feel good
again, all right?

22:41.499 --> 22:43.739
This is gonna be the most
important decision in your life.

22:43.780 --> 22:47.259
- Hi, young man.
- I'm John Thompson
from Georgetown University.

22:47.340 --> 22:50.980

23:03.061 --> 23:06.221
This will be the most important
decision in your life.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.181
Coach, I understand
the magnitude of this decision.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.500
God bless you, son.

23:10.541 --> 23:13.140

23:13.220 --> 23:15.980

You look fuckin' wonderful!

23:21.662 --> 23:26.941
You know what? You look like

23:27.021 --> 23:29.500

23:29.581 --> 23:31.742
So what do you wanna do

23:31.823 --> 23:34.062
I wanna go on the Cyclone.
I wanna go on the Turbo-Jet.

23:34.142 --> 23:37.102
- I wanna go on the Wonder Wheel.
- Damn!

23:37.181 --> 23:39.822
Brother?

23:39.863 --> 23:43.181
Do you know me?
Do you know my lady?

23:43.261 --> 23:45.102
No, I don't think so.

23:45.182 --> 23:48.783
Well, brother, you lookin' at us with
all that fuckin' familiarity and shit.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.823
Mind your own business, man.

23:54.903 --> 23:57.583
Yeah, you right.

23:57.663 --> 24:00.501
Obviously, I'm wrong, brother.
It's my mistake, uh--

24:02.983 --> 24:04.183
No disrespect.

24:05.383 --> 24:07.262
I don't want no trouble, my man.

24:13.823 --> 24:17.224
Bitch, what--
Get your motherfuckin'--

24:24.263 --> 24:27.023
I gotta meet your brother.
Please let me meet your brother.

24:27.104 --> 24:30.384
I have to meet him. We'll talk about
this tomorrow. See you later, Mary.

24:30.423 --> 24:33.064
See you, Sarah.

24:36.024 --> 24:37.263
Miss Shuttlesworth.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.784
Boo Boo.

24:52.424 --> 24:54.265
- It's okay.
- Daddy.

24:54.345 --> 24:56.185
How're you doin', baby?

24:57.264 --> 25:00.104
Oh! My little woman.

25:00.184 --> 25:02.426
- Daddy.
- How're you doin', baby?

25:02.506 --> 25:06.185
Look at you. You done all grown up
and everything like that.

25:06.265 --> 25:09.185
That's what I keep trying
to tell him.

25:09.265 --> 25:12.625
- How's he doin'? How's your brother?
- Bossy as usual.

25:12.665 --> 25:14.546
He's supposed to be bossy
and everything like that.

25:14.626 --> 25:17.186
He's supposed to be,
taking care of his little sister.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.986
Daddy, when did you get out?

25:20.065 --> 25:22.386
Last night.

25:22.465 --> 25:24.306
Look. Come on.

25:24.386 --> 25:26.706
Let me walk you over to Uncle Bubba
and Aunt Sally's house.

25:26.785 --> 25:29.865
We don't live there anymore.
He moved us out.

25:29.944 --> 25:32.827
- Where you all live at?
- O'Dwyer Gardens.

25:32.867 --> 25:35.746
Uncle Bubba
hasn't changed a bit.

25:35.827 --> 25:38.186
So who payin' the rent?

25:38.267 --> 25:41.186
- My brother.
- Your brother?

25:41.266 --> 25:42.826
- He workin'?

25:42.906 --> 25:46.107
-How long y'all been livin' around here?
-About a year.

25:46.186 --> 25:48.107

25:48.186 --> 25:50.986
That's good. How're you doin'

25:51.066 --> 25:53.908
- I got an "A" in Science.
- In Science, yeah? What you studyin'?

25:53.986 --> 25:56.747
- Oh, cells or somethin'.
- Cells?

25:56.827 --> 25:58.946
Yeah, me too.

26:00.467 --> 26:02.829
- So, this is our building.
- Right here?

26:02.908 --> 26:04.308
Yeah.

26:04.387 --> 26:06.507
It's all right.
This is pretty nice, actually.

26:08.227 --> 26:10.308
So--

26:12.907 --> 26:15.347
You ain't gonna
invite me upstairs?

26:17.187 --> 26:19.588
I don't know if I should.
I could get in trouble.

26:19.668 --> 26:21.548
- With who?
- You know who.

26:21.629 --> 26:23.628
All right.
Tell you what.

26:23.708 --> 26:26.588
I'll leave before he come,
all right?

26:28.309 --> 26:30.627
All right, Boo?

26:30.668 --> 26:32.549
Okay.

26:33.709 --> 26:36.148
What's in the bag?

26:36.228 --> 26:40.229
Toothbrush, toothpaste. An afro pick?

26:41.868 --> 26:45.468
Underwear?
Skittles, Daddy!

26:45.548 --> 26:48.429
Ha-ha!
You figured I forgot, huh?

26:50.429 --> 26:53.468
- You went shopping?
- Yeah, a little bit. Who this, baby?

26:53.549 --> 26:56.589
That's Lala.
Lala Bonilla, Jesus's lady.

26:56.669 --> 26:58.389
Lala Bonilla.

26:58.469 --> 27:02.670
Daddy, how'd you get out? I thought you
were gonna be away a long, long time.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.909
Can Daddy's little Boo Boo
keep a secret?

27:04.990 --> 27:06.949
Yeah.

27:07.030 --> 27:11.830
I'm out on a-- what you call like a...
work release program, baby,

27:11.910 --> 27:13.870
where's if l--

27:13.949 --> 27:16.989
- Well, I got a week to do a job.
- Meaning?

27:17.069 --> 27:20.310
Meaning if I do a good job,
I can get out sooner than expected.

27:20.390 --> 27:24.070
- What kind of job do you have to do?
- I can't tell you that yet.

27:24.111 --> 27:27.829
Because I'm too young.
I cannot wait until I'm 18.

27:27.909 --> 27:30.630
I am tired of people telling me
that I'm not old enough.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.951
"Can't do this. No, no, honey,
can't do this. You're too young--"

27:32.991 --> 27:35.310
Hold on, hold on.
Sit down.

27:37.071 --> 27:41.231
Look. Number one, you ain't too young.
You're a young woman.

27:41.270 --> 27:43.792
It's just that I could...
get in trouble.

27:43.871 --> 27:47.031
- Now, you don't want your daddy
to get in trouble, do you?
- No.

27:47.109 --> 27:50.831
I don't want you getting into any more
trouble. I know it wasn't your fault.

27:50.912 --> 27:53.431
I know you didn't mean it.

27:55.111 --> 27:58.631
You don't know what
that means to your daddy.

27:58.711 --> 28:01.191
Now, let's hit them Skittles.

28:01.271 --> 28:04.111
Your brother, he's doin'
all right, huh?

28:04.192 --> 28:06.032
- He is so good.
- Yeah?

28:06.112 --> 28:08.352
He is better than good, Daddy.
You should see him play.

28:08.432 --> 28:10.431
He's a zillion times better
than when you last saw him.

28:10.512 --> 28:13.592
- Remember when he used to be
so weak on his left hand?
- Yeah.

28:13.672 --> 28:15.911
Naw, now he can handle it
with both.

28:15.992 --> 28:18.273
- And he can shake so good.
- Can he?

28:18.353 --> 28:20.472
I bet he can finally beat you.

28:21.592 --> 28:22.832
You think so?

28:25.793 --> 28:28.353
-Yeah, he probably can.

28:30.792 --> 28:34.193
You've reached Mary and Jesus.
We're not at home.

28:34.274 --> 28:37.192
- Leave a message at the beep.

28:37.273 --> 28:39.353
It's me, baby. It's Lala.

28:44.993 --> 28:47.833
Hello, son.

28:47.872 --> 28:50.233
Mary, what did I tell you
about letting strangers in the house?

28:50.314 --> 28:53.632
- He's not a stranger. He's our father.
- I don't have a father.

28:53.673 --> 28:55.234
- Hey, wait a minute--
- Daddy, he's trippin'.

28:55.314 --> 28:58.193
Trippin'? We'll see who's trippin'
later on tonight.

28:58.274 --> 29:01.473
- What did I tell you about
talking to strangers anyway?
- "Don't do it."

29:01.514 --> 29:03.953
- And why?
- Because it may cause us harm.

29:04.034 --> 29:06.754
So why did you let
this stranger in our house?

29:06.834 --> 29:08.194
Mary, do you hear me talking to you?
Don't play deaf.

29:08.194 --> 29:08.434
Mary, do you hear me talking to you?
Don't play deaf.

29:08.514 --> 29:11.354
I'm not standing here for
my health, and you ain't deaf.

29:11.394 --> 29:14.514
- Don't talk to your sister like that.
- Am I talkin' to you?

29:14.594 --> 29:18.795
Matter of fact, I don't
even know why you're here.

29:18.874 --> 29:20.835
Mary, answer me right now.

29:20.875 --> 29:23.035
I won't do it again,
I promise!

29:23.116 --> 29:25.795
It's time for you
to get to steppin'.

29:25.835 --> 29:29.276
And I'd appreciate it if you don't
ever walk through that door ever again.

29:29.354 --> 29:31.995
All right.
Look, I need to talk to you.

29:32.035 --> 29:35.395
- Why?
- I just need to. When can we talk?

29:35.475 --> 29:37.715
I don't know.
I'm usually around.

29:37.796 --> 29:40.755
- Where you gonna be at?
'Cause this is kinda urgent.
- I'm usually at the Garden.

29:40.835 --> 29:42.676
- All right.
- All right.

29:42.756 --> 29:46.195
- I'll see you down there.
- Yeah, you can see me there.

29:51.036 --> 29:53.595
Enjoy the Skittles, baby.

29:53.676 --> 29:56.356
Now you enjoy walkin'
out that front door.

29:58.955 --> 30:01.114
- Where you think you're goin'?
- Help!

30:01.155 --> 30:03.195
Get in there!

30:06.317 --> 30:08.437
Open the door!

30:08.516 --> 30:11.357
- Who's tryin' to break the door down?
- Booger!

30:13.356 --> 30:16.156
What's up?

30:16.196 --> 30:19.236
Hey, how y'all doin'?

30:19.317 --> 30:22.517
- Not good.
- What's wrong, dear?

30:22.557 --> 30:25.037
- Guess who showed at the apartment?
- Who?

30:25.117 --> 30:27.438
- Daddy.
- Lord have mercy!

30:27.517 --> 30:30.196
- Booger, take your cousin in your room.
- Go in the room.

30:30.277 --> 30:32.277
Come on, Mary. Um--

30:32.358 --> 30:34.637
You can play with
my Sony Playstation.

30:34.677 --> 30:37.718
- Good, 'cause I can always beat you.
- I'm gettin' good at--

30:37.797 --> 30:39.878
Sit down, son.

30:41.077 --> 30:43.397
When did all this happen?

30:45.357 --> 30:48.958
- About half an hour ago.
- What did he say? What does he want?

30:48.998 --> 30:51.118
He says he wants to speak to me.
He says it's urgent.

30:51.197 --> 30:54.879
- It don't make no sense.
- It makes perfect sense.
He smells the money.

30:54.958 --> 30:59.158
What I'd like to know, how does a
convicted murderer get out so quick?

30:59.238 --> 31:02.679
How can this happen?
He's not even eligible for parole yet.

31:02.758 --> 31:05.038
He told Mary that he was out
on a work release program or something.

31:05.119 --> 31:07.679
The man escaped
just like Shawshank.

31:07.718 --> 31:10.678
Clint Eastwood in Escape From Alcatraz.
The Fugitive.

31:10.759 --> 31:13.718
- He wasn't acting like no fugitive.
- We should call the cops.

31:13.799 --> 31:16.959
- Yeah.
- We ain't gonna do no such a thing.

31:16.998 --> 31:19.039
I think you need to go
and talk to your father.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.959
He ain't my father,
all right?

31:21.039 --> 31:24.799
I know how you feel, son,
but the fact remains he is your daddy.

31:24.880 --> 31:28.398
But as your legal guardians as appointed
by the court in the state of New York,

31:28.479 --> 31:31.039
I feel you need to involve us
more in your life.

31:31.119 --> 31:33.119
Jesus, we're family.

31:33.198 --> 31:35.280
Your mother-- Martha,

31:36.640 --> 31:40.160
my sister-- I loved her.

31:40.241 --> 31:42.840
We feel responsible
for the both of you.

31:42.880 --> 31:46.519
I made a promise to your mother
that if anything ever happened to her,

31:46.598 --> 31:50.081
that we would be there
for the both of you.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.640
You hear me, Jesus?

31:52.720 --> 31:56.240
Like I said, son, you need to talk
to your daddy, see what he has to say.

31:56.321 --> 31:58.800
I told him I'd be here
at the Garden.

31:58.840 --> 32:03.080
Before you go now, I want you to use
some of my John the Conqueror root.

32:03.119 --> 32:05.762
This is what my daddy brought
up here from Mississippi.

32:05.841 --> 32:09.640
Now, you rub some of this here between
your wrist and your elbow, see,

32:09.721 --> 32:11.600
just like this here.

32:11.641 --> 32:14.481
- Now, this'll fix you up real good.
- Oh, Bubba.

32:14.521 --> 32:17.681
Don't nobody care nothin'
about your country, backward old root.

32:17.761 --> 32:20.722
-This mojo works! It worked on your ass!
-Hmph!

32:20.802 --> 32:23.762
- No, thanks, Uncle Bubba.
- Suit yourself.

32:23.842 --> 32:27.641
- You make a decision yet?
- No, not yet.

32:27.721 --> 32:31.481
Your Aunt Sally feels bad
that we aren't being included
in such an important decision.

32:31.481 --> 32:35.482
He does not speak for me!
You do what you feel is right.

32:35.563 --> 32:39.321
- Thank you, Aunt Sally.
- Will you be quiet, please?

32:39.361 --> 32:42.002
What they offerin' you, boy?
What they gon' give you?

32:42.082 --> 32:45.562
- Full athletic scholarship.
- Whoo! That's wonderful!

32:45.641 --> 32:47.882
Full athletic scholarship,
that's all?

32:47.962 --> 32:50.643
No money, no cars,
no job for your family?

32:50.723 --> 32:53.603
- No school say nothin' like that.
- See, I don't believe that.

32:53.682 --> 32:55.643
You're tryin'
to hold out on us.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.722
- Holdin' out?
- You're tryin' to cut us out the deal.

32:57.802 --> 33:01.323
- What deal?
- The deal is about to go down!
I hear things.

33:01.362 --> 33:03.282
No, you ain't hear that.

33:03.362 --> 33:05.644
Think of your Uncle Bubba,
your Aunt Sally.

33:05.723 --> 33:08.523
I think it's only right that we
be compensated for sacrifices...

33:08.604 --> 33:10.524
we made when we
took y'all in.

33:10.603 --> 33:14.443
Bubba! I don't want
any part of this.

33:18.443 --> 33:20.844
I'm goin' into the bedroom.

33:20.924 --> 33:24.284
Good. Take your big ass
on in the bedroom, then.

33:24.364 --> 33:27.163
Why you gotta talk to Aunt Sally
like that? I thought we were family.

33:27.244 --> 33:30.483
-We are family. Blood, thick as thieves.
-I don't even know why l--

33:32.043 --> 33:33.843
My controls ain't workin'.
It's stickin' or something.

33:33.923 --> 33:36.523
I'm the bomb. I'm the bomb.
Say it. I'm the bomb.

33:36.604 --> 33:40.324
Mm-hmm, yo, I'm the bomb.
You know I'm the bomb, right?

33:40.364 --> 33:43.124
Now, we put out
a lot of money for y'all.

33:43.204 --> 33:46.044
All I'm asking is that you
let me wet my beak a little bit.

33:46.124 --> 33:47.764
- Wet your beak?
- Wet my beak, son.

33:47.844 --> 33:51.764
You didn't see The Godfather ll?
The man was called The Black Hand.

33:51.844 --> 33:54.125
- I suspect you already
got a deal in place.
- What kind of deal?

33:54.205 --> 33:56.364
The kind of deal that would enable you
to get your own apartment,

33:56.445 --> 33:59.044
pay rent, pay Ma Bell,

33:59.085 --> 34:02.925
pay Con Ed, buy clothes, furniture
with no visible means of income.

34:03.005 --> 34:06.166
You ain't got no job, son!
No J-O-B!

34:06.245 --> 34:10.286
Don't try to play me for no fool now.

34:10.364 --> 34:13.284
- Am I making this clear?
- Yeah, you're making it very clear!

34:13.324 --> 34:16.364
When I really get paid, I ain't gonna
lose track of you and Aunt Sally!

34:16.445 --> 34:19.966
I'm gonna take care of you,
with interest if you want!

34:20.045 --> 34:22.927
I ain't too old to have dreams.
Is that what you think?

34:22.967 --> 34:26.605
I still got dreams.
I got plans too. Big plans.

34:26.685 --> 34:30.487
- Now, why should me and
your Aunt Sally get cut off?
- Anything else, Uncle Bubba?

34:33.085 --> 34:34.927
-Yo.
-Yeah!

34:35.007 --> 34:38.126
- Check 'em.
- Ahh!

34:38.205 --> 34:40.045
These are the new Jordans.

34:40.126 --> 34:43.647
That's it, huh?Yeah.
How much these cost, man?

34:43.726 --> 34:47.966
- 139, 150 with tax.
- One-fi'ty? Where the holes at?

34:48.045 --> 34:49.688
They're on the inside.
You gotta lace 'em up that way.

34:49.768 --> 34:52.127
- Do that for me, man, all right?
-Yeah, no problem, man.

34:52.167 --> 34:54.127
Let's get rid of this first.

34:54.208 --> 34:56.206
139!

34:59.927 --> 35:01.807
It's arthritis.

35:01.887 --> 35:04.768
You know, I got that, uh...
arthritis thing happening.

35:04.848 --> 35:07.568
Yeah? My brother's got
the same arthritic condition.

35:07.648 --> 35:09.329
- Really?
- Only it's his left ankle.

35:09.368 --> 35:13.247
-It's going around here in Coney lsland.
-Yeah, yeah. It's contagious.

35:13.327 --> 35:15.448
- Like the plague.
-Yeah.

35:25.008 --> 35:26.927
Damn, what's he doin' here?

35:33.808 --> 35:35.809
Hello, Mr. Shuttlesworth.

35:35.888 --> 35:39.370
Since when do you start
calling your uncle Mister?

35:39.449 --> 35:41.289
Hello, Uncle Jake.

35:41.329 --> 35:42.929
- Huh?
- Hello, Uncle Jake.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.808
- How you doin'? You all right?
- Okay.

35:44.888 --> 35:47.088
- How's your game?
- Okay.

35:47.129 --> 35:49.408
- That left hand comin'?
- Okay.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.450
- Schoolwork?
- Okay.

35:51.529 --> 35:53.449
All right.

35:53.529 --> 35:56.928
So it look like you, uh--
look like you grew a little bit.

35:59.410 --> 36:01.328
- You think so?
- Oh, no doubt.

36:03.329 --> 36:05.930
- You ain't clownin' me, are you?
- I wouldn't clown you, son.

36:06.010 --> 36:08.450
I know you grew--
What, a couple, three inches?

36:08.529 --> 36:10.890
- Yo, for reals?
- It's the truth.

36:11.051 --> 36:12.770
I'm--

36:14.809 --> 36:18.050
That's the best news
I've heard in weeks.

36:19.329 --> 36:21.171
All right. Well, cool.

36:21.250 --> 36:25.130
I'm gonna let you two talk,
you know, get reacquainted.

36:30.611 --> 36:33.530
Hey, you eatin'
them vegetables, boy?

36:33.610 --> 36:35.332
- Always, man. Hey, welcome back.
- All right.

36:35.371 --> 36:38.611
- All right.
- So you got new Jordans, I see.

36:38.650 --> 36:42.331
Yeah.Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, a little somethin', son, you know.

36:42.412 --> 36:45.691
So you ready?
One-on-one?

36:45.771 --> 36:48.131
Still can't beat your pops?

36:49.691 --> 36:51.692
No, thank you.

36:51.773 --> 36:54.171
- You ain't no competition.
- I ain't no competition?

36:54.252 --> 36:57.291
- Naw.
- Son, l--

37:01.012 --> 37:04.291
- If your mother could see--

37:04.330 --> 37:07.332
Hey, all right. I'm sorry, all right?
Hey, wait a minute.

37:07.372 --> 37:09.332
That's the wrong way to start
a conversation with me.

37:09.412 --> 37:11.253
All right. Hold up, hold up.

37:11.332 --> 37:13.771
Look, you get
any of them letters?

37:15.412 --> 37:17.811
Yeah, I got
your stupid letters.

37:17.891 --> 37:20.653
I tore 'em up too.

37:20.694 --> 37:23.212
- What about Mary's?
- I tore those up too.

37:23.293 --> 37:28.332
All right. Since you too scared
to play me, can we talk for a moment?

37:28.413 --> 37:30.692
- Talk about what?
- A lot of things.

37:30.772 --> 37:34.293
I gotta ask you a few questions,
you know, catch up on things.

37:34.372 --> 37:37.174
Look, I don't have a lot of time,
so make it quick.

37:37.254 --> 37:40.054
I got even less time,
so I'm gonna make it real quick.

37:40.133 --> 37:44.054
I read all about you,
everything like that, and, uh--

37:44.133 --> 37:47.293
Game really developed.
All the hard work done paid off.

37:47.333 --> 37:49.853
I'm proud of you, son.
I mean that.

37:49.933 --> 37:52.934
I know these are
tough times for you now.

37:53.014 --> 37:56.094
So I figure, hey, you know,
you might need some fatherly advice.

37:56.173 --> 37:57.573
- From who?
- From me.

37:57.614 --> 38:01.335
- About what?
- About, number one,
where you gonna go to school.

38:01.374 --> 38:03.734
- Have you made a decision?
- Aw, damn! You too?

38:03.813 --> 38:05.815
I already know
what you're about to say.

38:05.895 --> 38:08.055
"This is about to be the most
important decision in your life."

38:08.135 --> 38:10.095
That ain't what I was about to say.
I'm gonna ask you--

38:10.174 --> 38:12.175
I'm just hopin' that you
ain't compromisin' yourself, son.

38:12.254 --> 38:15.254
I know what's going on. I know people
are offering you all kinds of things.

38:15.334 --> 38:19.974
I just don't wanna see you beholden
to somebody for something you done took.

38:20.013 --> 38:22.135
- Something I took?
- Yeah.

38:22.215 --> 38:25.495
What do you expect? I gotta
take care of Mary, nobody else but me.

38:25.536 --> 38:27.855
I refuse to let Mary grow up
in the same apartment with Uncle Bubba.

38:27.935 --> 38:32.655
Look. All I'm sayin' is--
I would like to know where you're goin'.

38:32.695 --> 38:35.616
- What difference does it
make where I'm goin'?
- I would like to know.

38:35.696 --> 38:38.695
I don't know yet.
I have to weigh my options.

38:38.776 --> 38:41.976
- You got any idea?
- Like I told the rest of
the world, I don't know yet.

38:43.095 --> 38:46.176
I pray that you understand...

38:46.255 --> 38:48.615
why I pushed you so hard.

38:48.695 --> 38:51.057
It was only to get you
to that next level, son.

38:51.136 --> 38:53.697
You's the first Shuttlesworth that's
even gonna make it out these projects.

38:53.777 --> 38:57.336
I was the one who put the ball in
your hand. I put the ball in your crib.

38:57.376 --> 38:59.416
- I ain't no baby no more.
- All right.

38:59.456 --> 39:02.936
Why the hell did you name me Jesus
anyway? What type of name is that?

39:02.976 --> 39:05.897
- It's a biblical name.
- No kiddin'.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.377
- You don't like that name?
- I never liked my name.

39:08.457 --> 39:11.296
- You ain't never told me.
- I used to tell Mommy a lot of things.

39:11.376 --> 39:14.496
- Why you ain't never tell me?
- You haven't been around lately.

39:14.537 --> 39:18.296
I used to hate for Mom
to call me in to come in for dinner.

39:18.377 --> 39:20.738
Jesus! Jesus!

39:20.777 --> 39:23.577
You're lucky my dribble's got--

39:23.657 --> 39:26.417
- Dusted in for the N.B.A.
- Shut up! You look like--

39:26.497 --> 39:28.817
- You look like a cockroach.
- Cockroach?

39:28.856 --> 39:31.137
Cockroach this then.
Cockroach this.

39:31.217 --> 39:34.257
That way. That way.

39:36.099 --> 39:39.017
You just can't shoot
the darn fool.

39:39.098 --> 39:41.858
- Ooh, shoot it? Shoot it?
- Yeah, shoot it.

39:41.938 --> 39:45.578
Jesus!

39:45.617 --> 39:47.898
- Jesus! Jesus!
- Jesus!

39:47.937 --> 39:51.658
Jesus, time to come in and eat.
Bring your cousin Booger with you.

39:51.739 --> 39:53.899
Could I just finish
one more shot, please?

39:53.978 --> 39:57.139
- No! I said now, and I mean it!
- Come on.

39:57.179 --> 40:00.457
People used to think she was
some type of religious freak,
catchin' the Holy Ghost.

40:00.498 --> 40:02.458
Save me, Jesus!
Save me, Jesus!

40:02.538 --> 40:05.337
- Just stop, Booger! That ain't funny!
- Well, it's funny to me.

40:05.418 --> 40:08.819
Funny to me, just like you pickin'
and eatin' your boogers all the time.

40:08.899 --> 40:11.539
- I don't eat my boogers!
- Yes, you do!

40:11.619 --> 40:13.980
Man, you never seen me
eat my boogers.

40:14.058 --> 40:16.419
How many you see me eat?
One, two or three?

40:16.498 --> 40:19.299
I came to this court by myself.
Why you gotta follow me?

40:19.379 --> 40:22.660
- Maybe I wanted to play with Jesus.
- Jesus!

40:22.740 --> 40:24.659
Jesus! Jesus!

40:24.739 --> 40:26.980
- Jesus!
- Look at that.

40:27.060 --> 40:29.699
Moses parted the Red Sea,
not Jesus.

40:29.779 --> 40:31.819
- Moses, Jesus, whatever.
- Whatever?

40:31.900 --> 40:33.260
Whatever.

40:33.339 --> 40:36.461
Everybody and their mama's running
around sayin' they're born again.

40:36.541 --> 40:39.860
Especially all
these athletes and entertainers.

40:39.939 --> 40:43.701
They get caught smokin' crack
in the hotel with ten whores.

40:43.780 --> 40:47.859
All of a sudden they have a religious
experience? They find Jesus, all right.

40:47.899 --> 40:51.340
What's wrong with finding Jesus, huh?
What's wrong with that?

40:51.421 --> 40:55.621
How come you never hear Jesus being
praised in the losers' locker room then?

40:55.661 --> 40:58.300
- They're probably cursin'
that motherfucker out.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.

40:58.381 --> 41:00.261
- First, number one--
- God ain't shit.

41:00.300 --> 41:03.060
Number one, why you gotta use
all this kinda language?

41:03.140 --> 41:05.460
You some kind of heathen now?
You don't make no mistakes?

41:05.500 --> 41:08.340
You be out here shootin', but you
don't miss no shots ever? Ever?

41:08.381 --> 41:11.862
People make mistakes. People veer off
the path. So what? God forgives them.

41:11.900 --> 41:14.260
- Has God forgiven you
for killing my mother?
- I pray that He has.

41:14.340 --> 41:18.261
- I believe He has. When will you?
- Never.

41:18.341 --> 41:20.181
All right.
Well, hey, look.

41:21.703 --> 41:24.343
- Hey. Shit.
- "Thou shall not kill."

41:24.382 --> 41:26.861
- lsn't that from the Good Book?
- That's in the Good Book. So?

41:26.902 --> 41:30.422
So what? Ain't nothin' I can do, son,
that can bring your mother back.

41:30.502 --> 41:33.702
What you want me to do, huh?

41:33.783 --> 41:35.701
Did you even love my mother?

41:35.781 --> 41:38.223
Yes, I loved her!

41:38.262 --> 41:41.022
I loved her more than life itself.

41:41.102 --> 41:44.063
You sure did have
a hell of a way of showin' it.

41:45.342 --> 41:48.582
When you goin' back anyway?

41:48.662 --> 41:51.663
Yo, I got next.
I got next game, bro.

42:03.182 --> 42:06.062
I wanna go eat.

42:06.143 --> 42:08.904
Jesus, you off
the phone yet?

42:10.103 --> 42:12.184
Hey.

42:13.463 --> 42:15.624
You been on the phone
all night.

42:15.704 --> 42:18.503
All these schools callin', we need
to just get another unlisted number.

42:18.583 --> 42:21.945
- It still gets out.
- I'll be so glad when
all this stuff is over.

42:21.985 --> 42:24.384
- I know you will.
- How long's it gonna be?

42:24.464 --> 42:28.624
- Monday morning.
- Praise the Lord, and thank you, Jesus.

42:28.704 --> 42:31.223
You think that's funny, don't you?

42:31.303 --> 42:33.424
- I like teasing you.
- I know you do.

42:33.464 --> 42:36.345
Everybody says I'm gonna be rich,
won't have to worry about a thing.

42:36.424 --> 42:40.585
- Did your father tell you that?
- No, but everybody else in the world.

42:40.624 --> 42:43.184
Everybody else
in the world don't know.

42:43.264 --> 42:46.224
Everybody says you're gonna play pro
ball and have your own Nike sneakers...

42:46.304 --> 42:48.825
and star in commercials
and make mad loot.

42:48.904 --> 42:51.344
So much money that we won't be
in Coney lsland no more.

42:51.426 --> 42:53.306
What did I tell you about listening
to what people say?

42:53.345 --> 42:56.944
I hear what you say, but if
everybody's sayin' the same
thing, it's gotta be true.

42:57.025 --> 43:01.146
Uncle Bubba even said you were
gonna buy him and Aunt Sally
some new house in Long lsland.

43:01.224 --> 43:03.705
He asked me if I want
to go house shopping with him.

43:03.785 --> 43:06.906
Looking for a big old house, too,
with, like, a green lawn and grass...

43:06.986 --> 43:09.706
and lots of trees
and even a swimming pool in the back.

43:09.746 --> 43:11.825
- Uncle Bubba told you that?
- Mm-hmm.

43:11.905 --> 43:13.585
- I'm gonna have to talk
to that uncle of yours.
- All the kids in school say,

43:13.585 --> 43:15.026
- I'm gonna have to talk
to that uncle of yours.
- All the kids in school say,

43:15.105 --> 43:17.906
since I'm gonna be
so rich and famous, that...

43:17.985 --> 43:20.386
I'm not gonna need to go
to school anymore...

43:20.466 --> 43:22.426
'cause I already know how to count
and I'm just wasting my time.

43:22.506 --> 43:25.146
If I hear you talkin' like that again,
I'll kill you myself!

43:25.187 --> 43:26.547
Dang! Let go of me!

43:26.626 --> 43:28.986
All those kids don't mean shit!
I'm raising you, nobody else!

43:29.066 --> 43:30.906
- Get off of me!
- We're not rich.

43:30.986 --> 43:32.825
We don't have no money.
We don't have shit.

43:32.905 --> 43:36.465
If those were really
your friends, they wouldn't be
filling your head with bullshit.

43:36.546 --> 43:40.346
I didn't say I believed it. I just said
that that's what people are saying.

43:40.426 --> 43:42.707
- Can't believe you listen
to that bullshit.
- Fine! I'm sorry, all right?

43:42.787 --> 43:45.026
Goodness!

43:46.947 --> 43:49.786
You never tell me nothin'.
You never even have time for me no more.

43:49.867 --> 43:52.587
Well, it's gonna be over
Monday morning, okay?

44:02.267 --> 44:04.627
I'm really trippin'.

44:09.828 --> 44:12.868
I'm sorry. I apologize
for putting my hands on you, okay?

44:14.188 --> 44:15.427
I'm just-- I'm afraid.

44:17.028 --> 44:18.867
Me too.

44:18.948 --> 44:21.828
I mean, I just want
the best for both of us.

44:21.908 --> 44:25.309
And, you know, Mommy,
she wanted you to go to college.

44:25.349 --> 44:27.828
All these people around here, half
these people aren't going to college.

44:27.908 --> 44:30.309
Mommy wants you
to get your degree.

44:30.388 --> 44:33.668
Why is Daddy here?
Why did he come back?

44:33.708 --> 44:35.669
He's not gonna be here
much longer.

44:35.748 --> 44:38.149
But, Jesus,
I miss him so, so much.

44:41.629 --> 44:44.870
- Go to sleep.
- Good night.

44:49.988 --> 44:53.189
Hello, everyone. I'm Robin Roberts.
Welcome to Sports Center.

44:53.269 --> 44:55.829
Tonight, our feature is
about a biblical player--

44:55.868 --> 44:58.550
the Chosen One, the second coming,
the resurrection,

44:58.630 --> 45:00.510
the salvation.

45:00.549 --> 45:03.670
ESPN gets religion as we follow a day
in the life of Abraham Lincoln senior...

45:03.750 --> 45:08.150
Jesus Shuttlesworth, the number one
basketball prospect in the country.

45:08.230 --> 45:10.471
Jesus of Coney lsland.

45:10.511 --> 45:13.829
Jesus is the best thing to happen to the
game since the tennis shoe was invented.

45:13.910 --> 45:15.871
Jim Faen from Mount
Saint Mary's used to say,

45:15.950 --> 45:18.589
"He gives me a tingle,"
and I think that's what Jesus does.

45:18.629 --> 45:20.710
He makes you excited
to watch him.

45:20.750 --> 45:22.790
Whew! Jesus Shuttlesworth.

45:22.871 --> 45:25.671
He's the next phenom!
He's awesome, baby, with a capital "A"!

45:25.751 --> 45:28.711
The guy's unbelievable!
He's a P.T.P., a prime time player!

45:28.791 --> 45:31.830
He's the 3-S man!
Super, scintillating, sensational!

45:31.911 --> 45:33.470
He's a high riser!

45:33.510 --> 45:35.471
His game has got
everything you need.

45:35.551 --> 45:38.232
He can defend.
He can run. He can finish.

45:38.270 --> 45:40.792
He likes to play in a crowd,
and he can pass the basketball.

45:40.871 --> 45:42.911
He makes people better.
He's the real thing.

45:42.991 --> 45:45.991
He's able to do some of the things
that most coaches talk about,

45:46.031 --> 45:48.751
and that is being able
to be a triple threat.

45:48.831 --> 45:52.832
If that's something that we
as coaches have used for many
years-- dribble, pass and shoot.

45:52.912 --> 45:57.071
Pure shooter, fearsome defender,
a great player.

45:57.152 --> 45:59.872
He was coming down for a fast break,
and the defender went for the ball.

45:59.912 --> 46:03.392
He brought it behind his back
and switched it over to his right hand.

46:03.471 --> 46:04.951
It went through his legs.

46:05.031 --> 46:07.792
Defender came up and kind of
stutter-stepped a little bit,

46:07.833 --> 46:11.031
pulled back and rang the three.

46:11.112 --> 46:12.952
This kid might be ready
for the big leagues.

46:13.033 --> 46:15.952
He plays to win, and a lot
of people play to play.

46:16.032 --> 46:18.273
This guy plays to win.

46:18.353 --> 46:20.993
He understands that if he
performs better, they are going to win.

46:21.072 --> 46:23.793
But he knows how to pass.
He plays with his teammates.

46:23.873 --> 46:26.993
He has all the attributes
that go into being a winner.

46:27.073 --> 46:28.994
When I watched
Kenny Anderson's stuff,

46:29.073 --> 46:32.392
- I'd never thought I would see
anybody better than those guys.
- Shit.

46:32.432 --> 46:34.393
But along came Jesus.

46:34.433 --> 46:37.994
There are very few players
that give you 40 minutes of everything.

46:38.035 --> 46:41.793
Michael Jordan'll give you 35.
But 40 minutes of everything he's got...

46:41.874 --> 46:43.634
because of what he's overcome
in his life.

46:43.713 --> 46:45.994
In terms of dealing
with his sister,

46:46.033 --> 46:50.672
and all of the pitfalls that come
with being in a deprived situation.

46:50.753 --> 46:54.994
And in a situation that's void of any
kind of leadership other than his own,

46:55.074 --> 46:57.794
he's had to be
very, very self-reliant.

46:57.873 --> 47:01.635
Now, with kids as good as he is, he's
probably receiving a lot of pressure...

47:01.674 --> 47:04.594
to go into the N.B.A.
because so many kids are doing it.

47:04.673 --> 47:07.955
When you see a kid with this kind
of talent, it's almost normal for him...

47:08.036 --> 47:11.075
to take that into consideration with the
kind of money that they're getting now.

47:11.155 --> 47:14.035
But I would tell him that he needs to go
to college and get an education...

47:14.115 --> 47:16.474
so that he'll be able to save
the money that he has.

47:16.515 --> 47:19.514
My mother, she always
told me that, that...

47:19.595 --> 47:23.955
it was great to be a superstar athlete
and to be able to make it to the N.B.A.

47:24.035 --> 47:28.555
But... I mean, you're nothing
without your education.

47:28.635 --> 47:31.715
And, you know, ever since day one,
she wouldn't let me play basketball.

47:31.755 --> 47:35.715
She wouldn't let me play in the garden,
from day one, unless I did my homework.

47:35.795 --> 47:37.635
That's right.

47:37.716 --> 47:40.916
I think when April 11th comes,
I just wanna let my hair down,

47:40.997 --> 47:42.836
kick my feet up
and have a good time.

47:42.916 --> 47:45.155
Just go hang out with my boys
back in high school:

47:45.236 --> 47:46.796
- Sip, Booger, Lonnie, Mance.
- Lincoln! Linc-- Linc-- Lincoln!

47:46.836 --> 47:48.915
- Man, those are my partners.
- My name is Sip!

47:48.955 --> 47:50.836
Whether east or west!

47:50.876 --> 47:52.595
-Yeah!
- I rock this joint!

47:52.637 --> 47:55.116
-Yeah!
- With the most finesse. Roll call!

47:55.196 --> 47:57.996
Lincoln! Linc-- Linc-- Linc--
Lincoln! Roll call!

47:58.076 --> 47:59.756
- My name is Jesus.
-Yeah!

47:59.836 --> 48:01.476
- I am the man.
-Yeah!

48:01.557 --> 48:02.916
- What's up with these questions...
-Yeah!

48:02.996 --> 48:04.116
about my plan?

48:04.195 --> 48:07.316
I think it would just be
a sin that...

48:07.396 --> 48:10.517
you know, come...
two months from now,

48:10.557 --> 48:13.156
when I graduate,

48:13.237 --> 48:15.716
my mother, she won't be able
to attend my graduation...

48:15.797 --> 48:17.997
because, of course, she passed.

48:18.037 --> 48:21.237
What most impresses me
about Jesus Shuttlesworth...

48:21.317 --> 48:23.478
is the foresight
of his parents...

48:23.557 --> 48:27.358
to name him appropriately
as the world's greatest.

48:27.438 --> 48:29.197
- Jesus.
- Jesus.
- Jesus.

48:29.238 --> 48:31.636
- Jesus.
- Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus!

48:31.717 --> 48:33.398
- Jesus.
- Jesus.
- Jesus.

48:33.477 --> 48:35.277
- Jesus.
- Jesus.
- Jesus.

48:35.357 --> 48:37.556
- Jesus.
- Hallelujah, Jesus! Hallelujah!

48:37.597 --> 48:39.037
He got game.

48:39.159 --> 48:42.357
Who brought you this Victoria's Secret
bra-and-panties shit?

48:42.438 --> 48:45.278
Bitch, where do you get
this shit from? You crazy?

48:45.358 --> 48:48.158
-Bitch, are you outta your fuckin' mind?

48:48.198 --> 48:50.078
- Dakota.
- I'm sorry.

48:50.118 --> 48:52.039
Damn!

48:52.078 --> 48:54.599
I'm sorry, baby.

48:54.678 --> 48:57.318
The director is God.

48:57.399 --> 49:00.959
You have no vision from nobody.

49:00.999 --> 49:03.159
You tryin'
to antebellum my ass.

49:03.238 --> 49:06.399
You tryin' to fuckin'
plantationalize on me, ain't ya?

49:06.478 --> 49:09.560
Bitch, this ain't Gone With The Wind.

49:09.638 --> 49:13.040
You ain't Scarlett O'Hara!
I ain't Rhett Butler!

49:13.120 --> 49:15.118
Bitch, I'll kick your ass.

49:15.199 --> 49:17.399
Take that goddamn shit off.

49:17.479 --> 49:19.399
Fuckin' with me.

49:19.478 --> 49:21.718
Who the fuck
you think you are?

49:21.759 --> 49:24.960
I'm sorry.

49:28.879 --> 49:30.960
Bitch must be crazy.

49:31.001 --> 49:33.600
Chillin' me with some goddamn shit
from some other motherfucker.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.360
Who the fuck
does she think she is?

49:36.439 --> 49:40.161
I can't believe that bitch
did me like this.

49:52.920 --> 49:56.081
Hello?

49:56.120 --> 49:58.121
You all right? I heard
a lot of noise next door.

49:58.201 --> 50:00.680
I thought maybe you need some help,
or something like that.

50:06.280 --> 50:08.201
Here, let me help you up.

50:08.281 --> 50:10.121
- What the hell do you want?
- It's all right. Come here.

50:10.162 --> 50:12.081
I won't hurt you.
Come here.

50:12.162 --> 50:15.561
You can walk? You all right?

50:15.641 --> 50:19.880
Yeah. I need... some help!

50:19.961 --> 50:23.362
You weren't knocking on that door
while I was getting my ass beat.

50:23.442 --> 50:25.801
- Yeah, well, I didn't want to get
all up in your business--
- Smart, huh?

50:25.882 --> 50:29.682
- My God, it's funny, isn't it?
- Y'all got some ice around here?

50:29.722 --> 50:34.442
Oh, the sink doesn't work. There's
some cold water in the bathroom tub.

50:38.161 --> 50:40.003
Oh, God.

50:46.563 --> 50:48.763
At least I still got my teeth.

50:54.523 --> 50:56.883
- Put this right here.
- Thanks.

50:56.963 --> 50:58.803
Yeah. Right there.

51:04.083 --> 51:06.722
I seen you around, you know.

51:06.802 --> 51:08.925
- I noticed you right away.
-Yeah?

51:09.004 --> 51:11.924
- You don't belong here.
- Oh, yeah? How can you tell that?

51:12.004 --> 51:15.164
You don't seem like
the type of guy that would be here...

51:15.204 --> 51:17.483
in this house of ill repute.

51:23.083 --> 51:24.965
My name's Dakota.

51:26.444 --> 51:28.444
You ever been there?

51:28.525 --> 51:30.804
- Where?
- Dakota.

51:30.884 --> 51:34.484
Oh, no, no, no.
I ain't never been nowhere.

51:34.564 --> 51:37.485
I'm from upstate New York.

51:37.564 --> 51:40.005
- I'm, uh, Jake. Jake--
- Please, no last names.

51:40.085 --> 51:43.245
In my line of work,
last names aren't needed.

51:43.325 --> 51:47.524
You're actually better off
without them.

51:47.605 --> 51:50.804
- Why he beat you like that?
- Because he can.

51:50.885 --> 51:52.725
And why you let him though?

51:52.805 --> 51:54.925
Look. Are you trying to get
inside my head or something?

51:54.966 --> 51:57.046
- You trying to see how I think?
- Naw.

51:57.086 --> 51:59.085
You think you're
real slick, huh?

52:00.565 --> 52:03.885
Naw, I just, you know--

52:03.964 --> 52:06.086
I just want to get
to know you or something.

52:06.164 --> 52:08.685
Look, I'm not a crack 'ho, okay?
I don't do drugs.

52:08.766 --> 52:10.726
-I ain't accusing you of nothing, baby--
-Good.

52:10.807 --> 52:13.166
I just want you to know--
I don't do drugs. I'm clean.

52:13.246 --> 52:14.606
Right.

52:14.646 --> 52:17.165
You still didn't answer
my question though.

52:17.206 --> 52:21.405
Why you allow this, this,
this... pimp, you know, to just--

52:21.486 --> 52:24.565
- His name is Sweetness.
- Is what?

52:24.646 --> 52:26.526
- His name is Sweetness.
- All right.

52:26.567 --> 52:28.486
All right.
Why you allow Sweetness...

52:28.566 --> 52:31.806
to, you know, more or less,
just beat you down?

52:31.846 --> 52:33.646
A lot of reasons.

52:33.726 --> 52:35.526
- Mm.
- Take your pick.

52:35.607 --> 52:37.486
Shoot.

52:37.566 --> 52:39.487
I love him. He loves me.

52:39.527 --> 52:42.607
I'm his number one money-maker.
I'm his bottom bitch.

52:42.687 --> 52:45.527
Uh, low self-esteem.
I was abused as a child.

52:45.606 --> 52:49.207
And, you know, I deserved it.
It keeps me in line.

52:49.287 --> 52:51.487
And he always says he's sorry.

52:51.567 --> 52:54.128
You know,
we're going to get married...

52:54.208 --> 52:56.768
once he saves up enough money
to get out of this...

52:56.848 --> 52:58.688
sh-shit-hole.

52:58.768 --> 53:01.127
Here, let me freshen
that up for you.

53:02.888 --> 53:04.767
So what about you?

53:04.807 --> 53:06.727
I mean, look.

53:06.727 --> 53:09.049
That's one of my problems,
or one of my many problems.

53:09.128 --> 53:14.527
I tell people my whole life history and
I don't even know a thing about them.

53:14.607 --> 53:18.208
Ah. Well, I told you
my first name was Jake,

53:18.288 --> 53:20.488
and, uh, I got two children.

53:20.568 --> 53:22.929
Got a son.
His name is Jesus,

53:22.968 --> 53:26.049
and, uh, got a daughter
named Mary.

53:26.129 --> 53:28.169
Are you, like,
religious or something?

53:28.208 --> 53:31.768
Oh, most definitely. Most defin--
Well, more so like, uh--

53:31.849 --> 53:33.769
Well, spirituality too.

53:37.568 --> 53:40.528
You really think
you're slick, huh?

53:40.609 --> 53:43.409
I'm not talking anymore
about me until you...

53:43.490 --> 53:45.529
start talking some more
about you.

53:45.609 --> 53:49.369
All right. Well, um...

53:49.448 --> 53:53.848
I like you, you know, uh,
fa-- uh, Dakota.

53:53.929 --> 53:57.810
And, uh...

53:57.889 --> 54:00.450
I think that, uh...
I can help you.

54:00.531 --> 54:05.170
You know, trying
to fuck me isn't going to help me.

54:05.250 --> 54:08.529
- Okay?
- I ain't talking about
nothing like that.

54:08.609 --> 54:11.730
Why do you all men think...
dick is the cure-all?

54:11.809 --> 54:14.010
I don't know about all men,
but I don't even think like that.

54:14.050 --> 54:15.891
- Oh, no?
- No.

54:15.970 --> 54:17.810
- You got a dick, don't you?
- Without a doubt.

54:17.890 --> 54:19.731
- You got balls, don't you?
- Both of them. Both of them.

54:19.810 --> 54:21.971
You really
think you're slick, huh?

54:22.049 --> 54:24.532
No. I don't think
nothing like that.

54:24.611 --> 54:27.251
So you want to know
something about me, or not?

54:29.690 --> 54:32.492
I'm sorry.

54:32.570 --> 54:34.771
I talk too much.
That's what Sweetness always says.

54:37.811 --> 54:39.692
Where's my wig?

54:39.732 --> 54:41.611
Damn!

54:41.691 --> 54:43.411
- You lost your wig?
- Where's my wig?

54:44.451 --> 54:46.851
Oh, man.

54:46.931 --> 54:48.772
Look under the bed.

54:50.770 --> 54:52.651
Bingo. There it is.

54:52.691 --> 54:55.692
- Thanks.
- All right.

54:55.772 --> 54:58.211
Anyway, uh, l, uh...

54:58.292 --> 55:00.932
have a wife--
had a wife named Martha...

55:01.012 --> 55:04.171
and, uh...
I love her very much.

55:04.251 --> 55:06.291
Uh, I took her life.

55:06.331 --> 55:08.812
I murdered her, and, uh...

55:08.891 --> 55:10.973
I'm serving time
for that right now.

55:11.053 --> 55:13.892
I still got a ways
to go, and, uh...

55:15.452 --> 55:18.412
I guess it's like God is paying--
making me pay for my sins.

55:18.453 --> 55:20.333
Fuck you.

55:21.652 --> 55:24.092
Okay? You killed your wife?
I don't believe you.

55:24.172 --> 55:26.773
Well, it don't matter, but,
you know, it's true, uh...

55:26.852 --> 55:30.012
I'm on a kind of a...
work release program.

55:34.333 --> 55:37.853
Well, here we are, huh?

55:37.934 --> 55:39.894
Both fucked-up people.

55:43.813 --> 55:48.574
...kept his mouth shut before the game.

55:48.614 --> 55:50.534
Let's go to the Garden.

55:50.573 --> 55:52.853
First quarter, Knicks up one.
Jordan for three?

55:52.933 --> 55:55.454
Boo-yeah!
M.J. got much game.

55:55.533 --> 55:58.015
Beaucoup game
in the first quarter alone.

55:58.055 --> 56:00.534
- Jesus.
- I don't know yet.

56:00.614 --> 56:03.974
- No, it's me, baby. It's Lala.
- What time is it anyway?

56:04.054 --> 56:05.895
It's like 1:00 a.m.
I'm really sorry it's so late,

56:05.974 --> 56:07.934
but I really have
to speak to you.

56:07.974 --> 56:11.335
- Honey, I really need you to meet with
that guy I was telling you about.
- Who?

56:11.415 --> 56:14.055
- He still wants just
five minutes of your time.
- What's his name again?

56:14.135 --> 56:18.375
D'Andre Mackey.
He's a good brother also.

56:18.454 --> 56:20.255
- He's a good brother?
-Yeah.

56:20.375 --> 56:22.175
I don't know.
I was dreaming.

56:24.494 --> 56:26.936
I don't know, Lala.

56:27.015 --> 56:28.855
I'll get in trouble
for this.

56:28.935 --> 56:31.055
Look, I told you he's a really
good friend of the family,

56:31.136 --> 56:35.174
and... it would mean
a lot to me.

56:35.255 --> 56:37.095
So, please?

56:37.176 --> 56:39.694
All right, all right. Just let
me go back to sleep, okay?

56:39.775 --> 56:42.936
- Okay. I'll arrange everything.
- I'll see you tomorrow at school.

56:43.016 --> 56:44.816
Good night.

56:44.896 --> 56:47.375
- Jesus?
- What?

56:47.456 --> 56:50.576
- I love you.
- I love you too.

56:51.615 --> 56:53.616
So, what did he say?

56:53.696 --> 56:55.578
He's down whenever
you want to meet.

56:55.617 --> 56:59.336
Let's go, Shuttlesworth!

56:59.376 --> 57:02.616
Yeah, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

57:02.697 --> 57:04.976
- Morning, Jake.
- Hey, what's happening?

57:08.416 --> 57:10.338
What time is it?

57:11.618 --> 57:13.617
Time for you to get
your ass out of bed.

57:13.696 --> 57:16.577
You see, if I was you, I wouldn't
spend too much time sleeping.

57:16.658 --> 57:19.777
-Well, you ain't me, is you?
-That's right. I haven't killed anybody.

57:19.855 --> 57:22.697
- Yet.
- Why you got to take it there, Spivey?

57:22.737 --> 57:25.378
Come on, everybody, let's be friends.

57:25.458 --> 57:28.377
You know, it's
Tuesday morning, and time is flying.

57:28.458 --> 57:30.977
You trying to make me feel better?
I know what day it is.

57:31.057 --> 57:34.058
I don't want you to lose track of time.
You see, we're on a tight schedule.

57:34.138 --> 57:36.258
We can all go back early,
if you just...

57:36.337 --> 57:38.217
decide to give it up.

57:38.256 --> 57:40.139
Throw in the towel.

57:40.178 --> 57:42.818
You know, you haven't had
too much success with your son yet.

57:42.858 --> 57:45.299
- Have you?
- Come on now. Leave the man alone.

57:45.337 --> 57:47.939
It's not over till it's over,
till the fat lady sings.

57:47.978 --> 57:50.138
That's right. That's right.
So since I'm on the clock,

57:50.178 --> 57:52.618
if you two gentlemen don't mind,
can I get on with my day?

57:52.658 --> 57:55.658
We're leaving.

57:55.739 --> 57:59.498
- Just doing our job, baby.
- We all happy in our work, ain't we?

58:00.738 --> 58:02.619
Y'all want some breakfast?

58:02.699 --> 58:05.659
Naw, naw, naw. We had the continental
over at the Marriott.

58:05.698 --> 58:08.858
- Yeah? Ain't as good as this though.

58:11.298 --> 58:13.059
Give me one at a time,
one at a time.

58:13.139 --> 58:14.980
- Can I have your autograph?
- Back up.

58:15.059 --> 58:18.140
Hey, yo, back up! Hey, back up,
back up! Let the man breathe.

58:18.220 --> 58:20.939
Give him some air.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right.

58:21.020 --> 58:24.140
You want his autograph now, 'cause it's
going to be worth big money real soon.

58:24.180 --> 58:25.941
Now go on.
Hey, man, back up!

58:26.019 --> 58:27.860
Here you go.
Here you go, partner.

58:27.939 --> 58:31.099
Take it easy, Booger.
It's gonna be all right.

58:31.180 --> 58:33.020
I'll take care of you,
all right? See?

58:33.101 --> 58:35.540
I wonder where the hell
this bus is. Damn!

58:35.619 --> 58:37.540
- For whom the final bell tolls
- Whoo!

58:37.620 --> 58:40.581
- Big Time, what's up, baby?

58:40.661 --> 58:42.300
- What up, J-man?
- You got it.

58:42.381 --> 58:45.460
You not rolling public transportation
with all these knuckleheads.

58:45.541 --> 58:47.700
Big Time Willie, that's what I've been
trying to tell him but he won't listen.

58:47.781 --> 58:50.380
- I like to ride the bus.
These are my people.
- Hey, what's up with Jake?

58:50.420 --> 58:52.581
- These are my peeps right here.
-Yo, man, it's your pops.

58:52.661 --> 58:55.621
How are you doing, son?
Can I talk to you for a second?

58:55.701 --> 58:58.261
- One-on-one--
- Naw. Boog, get in the fucking car.

58:58.301 --> 59:00.821
We late for school.
Get in the fucking car, now.

59:00.900 --> 59:02.861
- Son--
- Hey, don't push me, man.

59:02.941 --> 59:06.740
- Can I talk to you, son?
- I don't know. You'll see me around.

59:06.820 --> 59:08.901
- Just off the back--
- Bye, Uncle Jake.

59:08.980 --> 59:11.502
Go ahead. Take off.

59:11.581 --> 59:13.901
- Smack me if I'm wrong--
- Big Time!

59:17.420 --> 59:19.341
So you want me to talk
to your pops, man?

59:19.381 --> 59:21.261
He's stressing you out, I see.

59:21.302 --> 59:23.941
I'll talk to him, man. I'll handle him.
Just give me the word.

59:23.982 --> 59:25.863
I can handle my own
business, all right?

59:25.902 --> 59:28.582
Yeah? You can handle it?
All right, J-man, handle it.

59:28.661 --> 59:30.703
You know, your pops,
bugged out as he is right now,

59:30.743 --> 59:33.182
back in the day,
he could play some ball, yeah.

59:33.262 --> 59:36.621
Did you know that? Huh?
Did you know that?

59:36.702 --> 59:41.063
- He knows.
-Yeah. Let's slide off to A.C., J-man.

59:41.103 --> 59:43.463
- What's up, Jesus!
- Atlantic City, my treat.

59:43.543 --> 59:45.743
- We got school.
- J-man.

59:45.783 --> 59:47.663
- A.C.--
- Like my cousin said, we got school.

59:47.703 --> 59:49.582
Right. My bad, my bad.

59:49.622 --> 59:52.223
Hey, can't be fucking with
y'all's education, right?Yeah.

59:52.261 --> 59:54.862
- So where you going to school, man?
You made up your mind?
- Not yet.

59:54.942 --> 59:56.983
Look, you pygmy motherfucker--

59:57.063 --> 59:59.263
- I'm not a pygmy.
- You want to walk to school?

59:59.304 --> 01:00:00.902
Big Time, it's cool.

01:00:00.983 --> 01:00:03.344
I'll kick your ass
out to the curb right now.

01:00:03.423 --> 01:00:05.104
I mean, my bad and all, my bad,

01:00:05.184 --> 01:00:07.744
but don't make me get violent
early in the morning.

01:00:07.783 --> 01:00:10.103
- Really. I ain't had my coffee.
- Be cool, all right?

01:00:10.182 --> 01:00:13.103
You know it's no coincidence
motherfuckers don't be fucking
with you, right?

01:00:13.144 --> 01:00:15.982
Starting beefs with you,
starting shit with you.

01:00:16.063 --> 01:00:18.144
You know.

01:00:18.183 --> 01:00:20.624
- As jealous as niggers is
around here, like that nigger.
- Jesus!

01:00:20.703 --> 01:00:22.944
Look, the reason
why nobody...

01:00:23.024 --> 01:00:25.664
fucks with you is 'cause Big Time Willie
put the word out, all right?

01:00:25.704 --> 01:00:28.865
- Oh, you did?
- Big Time Willie told motherfuckers...

01:00:28.944 --> 01:00:30.344
they be fucking with the J,

01:00:30.384 --> 01:00:32.944
they're gonna wake up dead
in the Atlantic Ocean.

01:00:33.024 --> 01:00:36.385
Look, I hate to break it
down to you this way,

01:00:36.465 --> 01:00:39.664
but it's not 'cause
they love you, man.

01:00:39.744 --> 01:00:44.785
Huh? The bigger a nigger get up in this
motherfucker, the more they hate you.

01:00:44.824 --> 01:00:47.185
All right? I mean,
you can play ball and all that,

01:00:47.264 --> 01:00:50.624
but, shit, that don't mean shit
to these niggers 'round here;
put a cap in your ass.

01:00:50.704 --> 01:00:54.345
Just on G.P. That's on the strength.
So you gotta watch your back.

01:00:54.424 --> 01:00:57.105
- Oh, so I should thank you then, huh?
- I don't give a fuck.

01:00:57.145 --> 01:00:59.465
I just want you to know
what the tick-tock is.

01:00:59.506 --> 01:01:01.385
He knows.

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:04.264
Yeah.

01:01:04.345 --> 01:01:07.666
You know, a lot of great ballplayers
came out of Coney lsland,

01:01:07.745 --> 01:01:10.065
but most of them
didn't amount to shit.

01:01:10.105 --> 01:01:12.546
- What about Stephan Marsbury?
He made it.
- Oh, true that, true that.

01:01:12.587 --> 01:01:16.745
-Yeah, but he's one of the few.
- If he can make it out here, so can l.

01:01:16.826 --> 01:01:19.625
-Yeah? You're gonna make it?
-Yeah, I'm gonna make it.

01:01:19.706 --> 01:01:23.106
You're gonna make it out like the rest
of these niggers out here, in a casket.

01:01:23.186 --> 01:01:26.826
First thing that's gonna take you out
is these drugs they got for you.

01:01:26.867 --> 01:01:30.427
And you got the cocaine,
heroin, crack cocaine.

01:01:30.507 --> 01:01:34.827
You got the uppers, the downers,
the chiva, crystal meth.

01:01:34.906 --> 01:01:37.906
Acid.
We got the nicotine for you.

01:01:37.987 --> 01:01:40.026
Huh? You don't want
none of that?

01:01:40.106 --> 01:01:42.908
And don't forget about
the alcohol, baby.

01:01:42.988 --> 01:01:46.706
Yeah, we got that malt liquor,
a.k.a. "liquid crack."

01:01:46.747 --> 01:01:49.627
Get that motherfucker.

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:53.027
Just for you, black man.

01:01:53.106 --> 01:01:56.027
You see that shit be advertised
up and down Park Avenue?

01:01:56.108 --> 01:01:59.068
Fuck, no!

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:01.988
Why do you fuck with me,
you fucking bitches?

01:02:02.067 --> 01:02:05.708
I keep telling y'all,
stop fucking with me.

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:07.707
Oh, and they got the other
thing for you, man.

01:02:07.747 --> 01:02:09.868
Yeah, I almost forgot.

01:02:09.907 --> 01:02:11.788
They got that pussy.

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:13.789
- Give it to me, James.
- Take it.

01:02:13.868 --> 01:02:15.788
I know you know how to
spell that, don't you?

01:02:15.868 --> 01:02:17.708
- I do.
- How you spell it?

01:02:17.788 --> 01:02:19.467

01:02:19.548 --> 01:02:21.627

He think 'cause he got that ball skill,
he goin' up in the N.B.A., he immune.

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:30.028
How you gonna be immune to pussy?
Pussy be talking to you, Jesus.

01:02:30.108 --> 01:02:31.948
Pussy be saying,

01:02:32.029 --> 01:02:33.869
"Come on in, Jesus.
Just a little taste."

01:02:33.909 --> 01:02:35.508
How you gonna be immune
to that shit?

01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:38.228
- Feel so good.
- All that titty up in your face.

01:02:38.268 --> 01:02:41.630
All that good ass.
How you gonna be immune to that thigh?

01:02:41.709 --> 01:02:45.030
All those lips, all those hips?
All those honey dips?

01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:48.349
Come on, man. Be real.

01:02:48.429 --> 01:02:50.709
That shit will fuck
a nigger up quick.

01:02:50.749 --> 01:02:53.509
Deadly combination.
You know what I'm saying?

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:56.310
And I didn't even mention
the bloodsucking leeches.

01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:58.270
Oh, yeah.

01:02:58.310 --> 01:03:00.509
The newfound family.

01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:04.310
Pygmy buzzards be hovering over you
trying to get that loose change.

01:03:04.391 --> 01:03:06.509
You know what I'm saying?
Huh?

01:03:06.590 --> 01:03:09.150
They talking about "l love you."
"Oh, I love you."

01:03:09.229 --> 01:03:12.110
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you, Jesus. Oh, I love you.

01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:13.390
- You know I love you.
- I love you.

01:03:13.471 --> 01:03:16.871
Te amo. Jesús, te amo.
Aye, qué fiebre.

01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:19.071
Come on, man.
I need some money.

01:03:19.151 --> 01:03:21.030
- I love you so much.
- I need some money.

01:03:21.111 --> 01:03:22.231
- Hook a brother up.
- Give me some money.

01:03:22.271 --> 01:03:23.751
I need some cash.
I'm gonna get these Nikes.

01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:26.190
- I can't have anything but the best.
- This Hilfiger sweater--

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:28.151
-Don't you want me looking good for you?
-I need some money.

01:03:28.231 --> 01:03:31.831
- I love you.
- Hook a sister up. I need some money.

01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:35.911
I need some Similac for my baby.
I need some Pampers for my baby.

01:03:35.991 --> 01:03:38.590
I need some Dolce Gabbana for me.
I need some Chanel.

01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:40.511
I need some Fendi.
Come on.

01:03:40.592 --> 01:03:44.112
- Mira, papi. Big Time!
- What's up? How you doing?

01:03:44.191 --> 01:03:46.151
¿ Dónde estabas tú anoche,
chico?

01:03:46.271 --> 01:03:48.511
- Let's go, Sip.
- Here you go. Come get it.

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:50.271
Come on, slide through.
Slide through, slide through.

01:03:50.352 --> 01:03:54.351
- Here you go. I got, I got you.
- Come on, come on.

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:56.673
- Pass, Sip.
- Yo, pick that up, G.

01:03:56.752 --> 01:04:00.032
- Goddamn, man!
- Good block, baby.

01:04:00.073 --> 01:04:01.712
- Ball out, man.
- What?

01:04:01.753 --> 01:04:03.551
- What you mean, what?
You fouled the fuck out of me.
- That was our ball!

01:04:03.592 --> 01:04:05.472
You fouled me. It's the only way
you're gonna block my shot anyway.

01:04:05.512 --> 01:04:07.392
You fouled me, you fouled me.
Boo-hoo!

01:04:07.472 --> 01:04:10.112
- Always crying.
- You the crybaby, you little
church-going motherfucker.

01:04:10.192 --> 01:04:11.874
That's why I don't like
playing with your ass, son.

01:04:11.952 --> 01:04:14.513
You swear you Jordan up in this piece.
You foul motherfuckers too.

01:04:14.592 --> 01:04:17.193
- Man, shut your--
- Fuck the call.

01:04:17.272 --> 01:04:19.592
- Give me the damn ball!
- Here, you want the ball?

01:04:19.673 --> 01:04:21.713
Go get it!

01:04:21.792 --> 01:04:23.632
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

01:04:23.712 --> 01:04:25.792
- Yo, I made that shit.
- That's a million-dollar shot, baby.

01:04:25.873 --> 01:04:28.354
- Goddamn!
- Jesus!

01:04:28.433 --> 01:04:30.593
- Coach is back.
- I need to see you in my office now.

01:04:30.673 --> 01:04:33.833
- So what's up, Coach?
- You know, I don't want
to keep busting your balls,

01:04:33.872 --> 01:04:36.033
but you got any idea where you're
going to go with this thing?

01:04:36.113 --> 01:04:38.153
I mean, kid,
an inkling, anything?

01:04:38.234 --> 01:04:40.553
- Naw, I don't know yet.
- You're not holding out on me, are you?

01:04:40.593 --> 01:04:43.394
No, Coach, you know I wouldn't do that
to you. I just don't know yet.

01:04:43.474 --> 01:04:46.595
I'll know on Monday morning.
I still have to weigh my options.

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:49.033
Do me a favor.
Go lock the door.

01:04:49.113 --> 01:04:50.954
Lock the door.

01:05:05.634 --> 01:05:07.474
- Sit down.
- What's that?

01:05:07.555 --> 01:05:09.754
Sit down, Jesus.
Sit down.

01:05:09.834 --> 01:05:13.515
It's, uh-- it's a little
package to help you...

01:05:13.595 --> 01:05:16.916
-maybe make your decision before Monday.
-I don't need that.

01:05:16.995 --> 01:05:19.315
Buddy, you know what this is?

01:05:19.355 --> 01:05:21.475
- What?
- That's $10,000.

01:05:21.556 --> 01:05:24.794
Huh? Take it.
10,000 "braziuls."

01:05:24.834 --> 01:05:27.756
Hey, hey, you know how much
Hilfiger this buys?

01:05:27.836 --> 01:05:31.075
Come on.

01:05:31.155 --> 01:05:32.995
It's yours. Don't be
afraid of it. Take it.

01:05:33.076 --> 01:05:35.195
- I can't take that.
- What do you mean? You been taking it.

01:05:35.275 --> 01:05:37.395
- I can't take it.
- You've been taking, kid.

01:05:37.476 --> 01:05:40.835
You told me before that it was
just a loan, didn't you?

01:05:40.916 --> 01:05:42.676
You're talking semantics here.

01:05:42.716 --> 01:05:46.996
Jesus, the fact remains, you took
the do-re-mi, pal. Think back with me.

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:49.435
You remember that little problem
you had with Calculus?

01:05:49.516 --> 01:05:51.716
You remember the grade
you couldn't get?

01:05:51.796 --> 01:05:54.516
Coach bumped that up a bit for you.
You passed the course, didn't you?

01:05:54.597 --> 01:05:58.157
- Yeah.
- Your "dusanikbats" uncle.
You had to get out of his house.

01:05:58.757 --> 01:06:01.677
Within one week, a truck came and
moved you and your kid sister out.

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:03.916
I ever bring that up?

01:06:03.996 --> 01:06:05.996
Never a word out of me.
Always there for you.

01:06:06.076 --> 01:06:07.917
Am I lying? Come on, kid.

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.837
Come on, please, will you?

01:06:09.915 --> 01:06:12.076
I'm not asking you to commit a homicide
here. I'm asking you to just give me...

01:06:12.156 --> 01:06:14.037
a little bit of information.
I need something-- anything.

01:06:14.118 --> 01:06:15.957
I ain't got nothing
to say, Coach.

01:06:16.037 --> 01:06:18.318
When I was a kid, my mother used to
go, "Arthur, you're a capo tost."

01:06:18.397 --> 01:06:20.477
- You know what a "capo tost" is?
- Naw.

01:06:20.557 --> 01:06:22.396
It means you got a head
like concrete.

01:06:22.477 --> 01:06:25.477
I think me and you, we suffer from
the same affliction. I swear to God.

01:06:25.556 --> 01:06:27.679
Kid, on the court, you're the most
coachable kid I ever had.

01:06:27.758 --> 01:06:29.597
I never had a boy
that could respond like you.

01:06:29.677 --> 01:06:31.758
Off the court,
I can't tell you a damn thing.

01:06:31.837 --> 01:06:33.918
This is your money.
Hey, this is yours.

01:06:33.999 --> 01:06:36.277
- I don't need that money, Coach.
- Tell me something.

01:06:36.357 --> 01:06:38.198
I got Calculus.

01:06:38.278 --> 01:06:41.197
You forgot something.

01:07:17.679 --> 01:07:19.559
Yeah.

01:07:20.879 --> 01:07:22.759
Mm, right there.

01:07:29.999 --> 01:07:32.840
Oh, yeah.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.560
- Mr. Shuttlesworth, how are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.041
- Dom Pagnotti. Pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:07:58.121 --> 01:07:59.961
- Hello, Lala.
- Hello.

01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:02.080
- D'Andre, what's up?
- How you doing?

01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:04.840
- Why don't we go inside?
I'll show you my house.
- We'd love to.

01:08:04.881 --> 01:08:08.361
- Wow. This a phat crib.
- Ain't it?

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.601
- What do you think?
- You have a really nice home.

01:08:11.681 --> 01:08:14.002
Thank you. I just did it.
Built it from scratch.

01:08:14.042 --> 01:08:15.922
- It's gorgeous.
- Thank you.

01:08:15.961 --> 01:08:19.082
Why don't you and Lala make
yourself at home and let me
and Jesus discuss some business.

01:08:19.121 --> 01:08:24.201
This right here
is a 355 Ferrari Spider, $130,000.

01:08:24.241 --> 01:08:28.042
You're looking at
a 12-cylinder Mercedes, 600 SL--

01:08:28.082 --> 01:08:29.962
$135,000.

01:08:30.002 --> 01:08:33.402
Now, if you want the best,
Jesus, you come right this way.

01:08:33.482 --> 01:08:36.442
A quarter-million-dollar
Lamborghini Diablo.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.362
- Take a look inside, Jesus.
- You can get a house
with a quarter million dollars.

01:08:38.442 --> 01:08:40.282
Not the house
I'm going to get you.

01:08:40.362 --> 01:08:42.202
- You like music?
- I love music.

01:08:42.281 --> 01:08:45.763
- Has a $30,000 stereo system.
State of the art.
- $30,000?

01:08:45.841 --> 01:08:48.763
30,000. That's a small trailer home
in North Carolina...

01:08:48.843 --> 01:08:50.843
you got playing music
for you right there.

01:08:50.923 --> 01:08:52.761
Now, Jesus,
I know you like Lala.

01:08:52.841 --> 01:08:55.363
Whatever may be may be.
But you can look like Buddy Hackett...

01:08:55.443 --> 01:08:58.124
and drive down a street with this
and have 40 girls chasing you.

01:08:58.163 --> 01:09:00.085
I want to show you my court.

01:09:00.122 --> 01:09:02.483
Oh, so you just got the court
built inside the house, huh?

01:09:02.523 --> 01:09:04.524
- Of course.
- Let's go one-on-one.

01:09:04.604 --> 01:09:06.483
- Let's see what you got.
- What I got?

01:09:06.563 --> 01:09:08.403
- Let's see what you got.
- I got--

01:09:11.724 --> 01:09:13.884
So you in the Mafia.
Down with Gotti, huh?

01:09:13.964 --> 01:09:15.883
Mafia? Gotti?

01:09:15.964 --> 01:09:19.684
Just because I'm an ltalian American
doesn't mean I'm involved with the mob.

01:09:19.764 --> 01:09:22.283
I'm the best at what I do.
I'm a sports agent.

01:09:22.363 --> 01:09:24.243
Now, I don't know
if you realize this,

01:09:24.283 --> 01:09:27.243
but several NBA teams
are interested in you right now.

01:09:27.283 --> 01:09:29.165
At this point in time,
I can't tell you who,

01:09:29.203 --> 01:09:31.124
but I will tell you
they are contenders.

01:09:31.165 --> 01:09:33.764
Now, I know you've considered
jumping straight to the pros.

01:09:33.844 --> 01:09:35.205
The money is there.

01:09:35.283 --> 01:09:38.765
I have the contacts.
So apply for the NBA draft now.

01:09:38.845 --> 01:09:41.444
Right here, Jesus,
is a contract.

01:09:41.524 --> 01:09:43.366
This makes me your agent.

01:09:43.444 --> 01:09:45.285
This allows me
to represent you.

01:09:45.363 --> 01:09:46.925
I will take you to the top.

01:09:46.965 --> 01:09:49.365
I can't do that right now.
I have to weigh my options.

01:09:49.444 --> 01:09:52.604
- How much does your watch cost?
- 89.95.

01:09:52.685 --> 01:09:55.285
89.95. Right here...

01:09:55.365 --> 01:09:57.884
is a platinum
and diamond Rolex.

01:09:57.965 --> 01:10:00.525
The best you can buy.

01:10:00.565 --> 01:10:03.805
Gold? Forget about it.
Silver? Forget about it.

01:10:03.885 --> 01:10:08.445
You have platinum and diamonds. That's
like having speed and power in the NBA.

01:10:08.525 --> 01:10:11.806
And, Jesus, that watch is a gift
from Dom Pagnotti to you.

01:10:11.885 --> 01:10:14.167
- Keep it.
- Oh, I bet there's strings
attached, too, huh?

01:10:14.246 --> 01:10:17.246
There's no strings, no rubber bands.
There's nothing attached at all.

01:10:17.326 --> 01:10:21.686
That's a $36,000 watch. That's like
having a Corvette on your wrist.

01:10:21.766 --> 01:10:24.407
- You keep that.
- I can't take this.

01:10:24.566 --> 01:10:25.646
- Why not?
- It's illegal. I can't take it.

01:10:25.687 --> 01:10:27.925
I don't see anyone here.
Just me and you.

01:10:28.006 --> 01:10:30.247
- There's nobody here,
but it's still illegal.
- You know what, Jesus?

01:10:30.328 --> 01:10:32.686
I'll keep it. The money
you and I gonna make together,

01:10:32.726 --> 01:10:35.127
you could buy 20 of them
if you want.

01:10:37.687 --> 01:10:40.286
Yeah, that's all good
and everything, but when I'm ready,

01:10:40.367 --> 01:10:43.086
- I'm thinking about hiring
a brother to represent me.
- Yeah? Why's that?

01:10:43.126 --> 01:10:45.008
I just feel comfortable
with a brother.

01:10:45.047 --> 01:10:46.567
All right, Jesus,
let me ask you a question.

01:10:46.648 --> 01:10:48.807
- What color is this?
- It's green.

01:10:48.886 --> 01:10:51.727
You're black, I'm white,
this is green.

01:10:51.767 --> 01:10:57.007
When making a business decision,
the only color that matters is green.

01:10:57.088 --> 01:10:59.968
Now, do you consider yourself
a man or a boy?

01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:01.968
- Of course I consider myself a man.
- Okay.

01:11:02.009 --> 01:11:04.527
Because men make decisions
with their mind.

01:11:04.608 --> 01:11:07.087
Boys make decisions
with their heart, Jesus.

01:11:07.127 --> 01:11:10.088
- My partner D'Andre, he's black.
- No!

01:11:10.168 --> 01:11:12.007
So it really doesn't matter.

01:11:12.087 --> 01:11:14.609
You have the best
of both worlds.

01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:17.729
You need to sign with me,
and you need to sign with me now.

01:11:17.808 --> 01:11:22.128
-You talk a great game.
-Jesus, this isn't a game. This is life.

01:11:22.208 --> 01:11:24.329
I can bring you
to the Promised Land,

01:11:24.408 --> 01:11:27.129
but what you need to do, Jesus,
is give me the opportunity...

01:11:27.168 --> 01:11:29.129
to show you how good I am.

01:11:38.568 --> 01:11:42.008
Dear Jesus,
your daddy and I hope you're fine.

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:43.930
"l thought it might be
a little hard for you...

01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:46.730
"being away from home for--
for the first time.

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:48.650
I had no idea that--"

01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:51.569
I didn't even know
they had basketball camps.

01:11:51.610 --> 01:11:55.449
Thank God I got you out of Coney lsland
for at least a week this summer.

01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:58.249
"You're really serious
about this basketball,

01:11:58.329 --> 01:12:00.171
and that's good."

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:02.730
However, I do wonder sometimes...

01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:05.410
whether it's you or your father
that wants to pursue this.

01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:07.570
I know he drives you
too hard.

01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:09.530
That's right. Come on,
come on. Work, baby.

01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:11.449
You got to work harder
than the next man, right?

01:12:11.489 --> 01:12:14.052
It's the will of the man;
it ain't the skill of the man.

01:12:14.131 --> 01:12:16.291
He can't play you.
He can't do nothing with you!

01:12:16.371 --> 01:12:18.971
We the only two people up. Me, you and
Michael Jordan. That's the only people.

01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:20.890
Everybody else in the world is asleep.

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:24.051
What you think Jordan doing right now?
He lifting weights right now.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.490
We out the projects, baby.
We out the projects.

01:12:26.531 --> 01:12:30.092
Where we gonna live at, son? Where
we living at, yo? Where we living at?

01:12:30.172 --> 01:12:32.372
Huh? We living on East Side.
Where we at?

01:12:32.451 --> 01:12:35.650
We're up on the Upper West Side?
Central Park West somewhere?

01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:39.051
- Where we gonna be at, huh?
What you gonna buy Mama, son?
- House.

01:12:39.131 --> 01:12:40.971
Come on.
A big house, right?

01:12:41.051 --> 01:12:42.931
How many bedrooms?
How many bedrooms?

01:12:43.011 --> 01:12:44.892
- How many she want?
- As many as she wants.

01:12:44.931 --> 01:12:47.093
Don't never let them see you weak.
Let me tell you something.

01:12:47.132 --> 01:12:49.372
- Don't never let them see you weak.
- This is for everything.

01:12:49.451 --> 01:12:51.613
You miss, you know
you givin' me ten pushups, right?

01:12:51.691 --> 01:12:54.331
You know if you miss, you
give me ten pushups, right?

01:12:54.411 --> 01:12:56.252
- All right, show me what you got.

01:12:56.332 --> 01:12:58.932
Concentrate.

01:12:58.972 --> 01:13:01.692
Four... three... two--

01:13:03.692 --> 01:13:06.813
That's what I'm talking about. That's
what I'm talking about. Are you tired?

01:13:06.892 --> 01:13:09.212
Jesus Shuttlesworth, he got game.
He don't get tired.

01:13:09.292 --> 01:13:12.532
- Are you tired? You tired?
- Uh-huh.

01:13:12.573 --> 01:13:14.853
"But, son, your father
does love you dearly."

01:13:14.933 --> 01:13:16.853
- You should have seen your boy today.
- What did he do?

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:19.733
- What'd you get them for, son?
- About 34 points.

01:13:19.773 --> 01:13:21.653
- Thirty-four.
- Thirty-four points?

01:13:21.692 --> 01:13:24.252
You got 34, but one time
he went up, I was like, "Oh, my boy."

01:13:24.332 --> 01:13:26.492
- I thought he was gonna dunk.
He just kept going.
- Really?

01:13:26.573 --> 01:13:29.974
He kept going. He's almost getting the
rim now, or the net, anyway-- the net.

01:13:30.014 --> 01:13:32.973
- That's my baby.
- That's right. My boy.

01:13:33.054 --> 01:13:35.893
"Have fun at the camp,
and remember--"

01:13:35.973 --> 01:13:38.654
Use basketball as a tool.

01:13:38.734 --> 01:13:40.693
"Love, Mommy."

01:13:41.893 --> 01:13:44.735
"P.S.-- Your sister
misses you badly."

01:13:44.813 --> 01:13:48.534
And when you get home,
please be nice to her.

01:13:48.574 --> 01:13:51.014
Big brothers have to protect
their little sisters.

01:14:41.816 --> 01:14:44.937
Come on, baby.

01:14:45.017 --> 01:14:47.817
- Don't hold back, baby.
- Oh, oh, yeah, oh.

01:14:47.896 --> 01:14:51.496
No, baby, come on. Don't hold back.

01:14:51.576 --> 01:14:53.577
Come on, baby.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.497
Oh, yeah, baby.
Fuck me now.

01:14:55.575 --> 01:14:57.376
Fuck me. Oh, yeah.

01:14:57.456 --> 01:15:00.617
Yeah. Come on, baby.

01:15:03.736 --> 01:15:06.097
Come on, baby, come on.
Fuck me, baby.

01:15:07.576 --> 01:15:11.056
Where them elbows at?
Give me the elbows. Make me pay for it.

01:15:11.136 --> 01:15:13.976
Make me pay if I get too close.
Make me pay!

01:15:14.017 --> 01:15:16.137
Yes. All right,
good shoot! Oh!

01:15:16.217 --> 01:15:18.058
- All right.
- All right, that's two.

01:15:18.138 --> 01:15:20.017
- Two-zip.
- Two-zip.

01:15:20.097 --> 01:15:22.816
I'll give you ten.

01:15:22.897 --> 01:15:25.457
He's cheating, Jesus.

01:15:27.417 --> 01:15:29.739
Come on now. Play ball.

01:15:29.818 --> 01:15:32.698
Just 'cause a man bigger than you,
don't mean he better than you.

01:15:32.738 --> 01:15:34.538
Whoo-hoo!

01:15:39.938 --> 01:15:41.897
Play some "D" now.

01:15:41.978 --> 01:15:43.817
Get up on him, Jesus.

01:15:43.898 --> 01:15:45.658
Money.
What's that, baby?

01:15:45.699 --> 01:15:49.379
- Ask Goose.
- What was that, ten-one?

01:15:49.459 --> 01:15:52.539
- Ten-two? Butter.
- Luck.

01:15:52.579 --> 01:15:54.458
You ain't ready for me.

01:15:54.497 --> 01:15:57.378
Come on, Jesus.
Get up on him, Jesus.

01:15:57.418 --> 01:15:59.579
- Check it out.
- Check 'em.

01:15:59.619 --> 01:16:02.099
- Don't push me.
- So what I push you? So what?

01:16:02.178 --> 01:16:04.059
You're gonna get mad
when you get pushed?

01:16:04.139 --> 01:16:06.140
What, you wanna quit
when you get pushed?

01:16:06.219 --> 01:16:08.099
- Oh!
- Take your shot.

01:16:08.139 --> 01:16:10.299
I could take you out
your game that easy, huh?

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.299
So somebody gets up on you.
So what?

01:16:12.379 --> 01:16:14.258
- Stop pushing him, man.
- You got to deal with that, son.

01:16:14.339 --> 01:16:17.460
You mad? That's all the players got
to do to you, is make you mad, huh?

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:20.859
All they gotta do is make you mad
and you'll give up, won't you?

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.820
'Cause when you get mad,
you can't play.

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:24.818
'Cause when you get mad,
you can't make a shot.

01:16:26.739 --> 01:16:28.700
Come get it now.
I ain't taking it easy on you.

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:31.861
I told you I ain't taking it easy
on you. Where you at, boy?

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.940
J-J, come on,
give the guy a break, man.

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.301
Come on,
go strong, Jesus.

01:16:36.381 --> 01:16:38.220
- Why you cheating, man?
- How did I cheat?

01:16:38.299 --> 01:16:40.660
- Don't tell me how to raise my son.
- Stop pushing me.

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:43.380
So I'm pushing you. So what?
Show me what you got.

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.822
Stop pushing me.

01:16:44.901 --> 01:16:46.741
- Take it! Take it!
- Go strong, baby.

01:16:46.821 --> 01:16:48.820
- Like nobody's better than you!
- I'm supposed to be scared?

01:16:48.901 --> 01:16:50.901
Yes. That's what
I'm talking about.

01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:53.500
No matter what I say to you, I ain't
got nothing to do with your game.

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.420
It's between you
and the rim.

01:16:55.461 --> 01:16:57.341
Don't be afraid of nobody.
That's right.

01:16:57.381 --> 01:16:59.581
Elbow me if--
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.782
- Go strong.
- Get out of here.

01:17:01.862 --> 01:17:04.741
Go get it, the ball.
Go get it.

01:17:08.421 --> 01:17:10.302
- Whoa, whoa.
- Get up.

01:17:10.341 --> 01:17:13.141
- Foul, man!
- All right, you got foul. No harm.

01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.822
Respect my call. Besides, that wasn't
a foul. That was attempted murder!

01:17:16.903 --> 01:17:19.062
What you mean, respect your call?
Ain't nobody even hardly touch you.

01:17:19.142 --> 01:17:22.702
- What you trying to prove?
- Just get up, boy, and stop
crying. Give me the ball.

01:17:22.782 --> 01:17:24.862
- Give me the ball, man.
- What you doing?

01:17:24.901 --> 01:17:26.342
- Check it out--
- Hey, respect my call.

01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:29.782
- Besides, that wasn't a foul--
- Don't start yelling at me, boy.

01:17:29.861 --> 01:17:32.144
No harm. No foul.
Are you hurt? You bleeding?

01:17:32.222 --> 01:17:34.743
What you think? I want to see
you get pushed like that. Ow!

01:17:34.823 --> 01:17:36.741
- You gonna cry now or something?
- Why you got to push-- Whoa!

01:17:36.821 --> 01:17:39.263
- Take the ball out. Huh?
- Man, I quit, man.

01:17:40.342 --> 01:17:43.702
- Man, I quit!
- You quit?

01:17:43.783 --> 01:17:46.544
- What?
- I quit. I'm out of here.

01:17:46.623 --> 01:17:48.783
Oh, you out of here now. You're
gonna quit like a little bitch, huh?

01:17:48.863 --> 01:17:51.143
Big bitch!

01:17:51.223 --> 01:17:53.264
You better go
and get my ball!

01:17:53.342 --> 01:17:55.142
- I ain't getting a damn thing!
- Jesus!

01:17:55.222 --> 01:17:58.143
- Daddy, leave me alone!
- Jake, that's some wrong shit, man.

01:17:58.183 --> 01:18:00.224
I'm out of here, man.

01:18:00.304 --> 01:18:02.663
Fuck, that's why
he ain't gonna make it.

01:18:05.423 --> 01:18:07.303
That's why he
ain't gonna make it.

01:18:13.784 --> 01:18:17.064
Damn, I can't believe he threw
that shit over the fence.

01:18:36.105 --> 01:18:38.024
What's the matter, baby?
You don't like the food.

01:18:38.105 --> 01:18:40.344
The food is fine.
Just not hungry.

01:18:41.385 --> 01:18:43.784
- Where's your daddy?
- I don't know, and I don't care.

01:18:43.865 --> 01:18:46.585
Uncle Jake must have beat him
in basketball again. Ow!

01:18:46.665 --> 01:18:49.705
- Stop hitting on him.
- Tell him to stop then. He
always getting on my nerves.

01:18:49.785 --> 01:18:51.625
No, I'm not going
to tell him to shut up,

01:18:51.705 --> 01:18:54.906
and these basketball wars between
you and your father have got to stop.

01:18:57.145 --> 01:18:59.545
I just asked your son
where you were.

01:19:01.386 --> 01:19:03.626
Don't they feed you
at home, Booger?

01:19:03.706 --> 01:19:05.547
How you doing, baby?

01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:14.345
Your food was getting cold,
so I put it in the oven.

01:19:17.906 --> 01:19:21.867
You know, when you threw that ball
over the fence, it got lost.

01:19:21.947 --> 01:19:23.906
You know that, right?

01:19:23.946 --> 01:19:26.306
Paid my hard-earned money for that
basketball. You know that, don't you?

01:19:26.346 --> 01:19:28.306
We can always buy
a new basketball.

01:19:28.386 --> 01:19:30.628
Yeah, we don't need
a new ball, okay?

01:19:30.667 --> 01:19:32.547
We had a ball already.

01:19:32.587 --> 01:19:34.627
Besides, you need to learn how
to respect other people's property.

01:19:34.667 --> 01:19:37.946
Ball belonged to me,
not to him.

01:19:46.427 --> 01:19:49.067
- Mommy, can I be excused?
- No, you cannot. Sit your ass down.

01:19:49.148 --> 01:19:51.427
- I'm finished!
- Yeah, well, you ain't excused though.

01:19:51.468 --> 01:19:53.986
- He's done, Jake.
- I ain't done. Sit your black ass down.

01:19:54.027 --> 01:19:56.788
And it's time for you to go.
And put the bread back down.

01:19:56.866 --> 01:19:58.426
- Trying to sneak bread all the time.
- Bye, Jesus!

01:19:58.506 --> 01:20:01.387
I said sit down. I'm your daddy
and you're gonna do what I tell you.

01:20:01.468 --> 01:20:03.308
Don't raise your voice.

01:20:03.388 --> 01:20:05.749
Do what I tell you to do,
and I'm telling you to sit down.

01:20:05.829 --> 01:20:07.828
- So? I'm finished.
- What?

01:20:07.908 --> 01:20:09.708
- You hear what I say to you, huh?
- Jake!

01:20:09.788 --> 01:20:12.228
- Boy, when I tell you to sit down--
- Get off me!

01:20:12.267 --> 01:20:14.668
- When I tell you to sit down--
- Jake, get off him!

01:20:14.748 --> 01:20:17.269
- Get up off me!
- Get off him! What's wrong with you?

01:20:17.349 --> 01:20:20.109
Are you out of your mind?

01:20:20.188 --> 01:20:22.349
Stop it! Please!

01:20:30.348 --> 01:20:32.230
Baby?

01:20:33.869 --> 01:20:37.469
- Mommy? Mommy?
- Baby?

01:20:37.549 --> 01:20:41.229
- Get up. Get up.
- Wake up, baby.

01:20:41.308 --> 01:20:43.829
Baby, wake up.
Call 9-1-1, son.

01:20:43.909 --> 01:20:48.390
Call 9-1-1. Go ahead.
Call 9-1-1. Go, go.

01:21:26.711 --> 01:21:28.710
Come on, let's walk.

01:21:33.271 --> 01:21:36.871
I knew you was going to come though.
I appreciate it, though, son.

01:21:36.952 --> 01:21:40.272
Yeah, I appreciate you for coming
to meet me and everything like that.

01:21:41.912 --> 01:21:47.151
I got this for Mary here. You know,
I thought she might like these here.

01:21:52.313 --> 01:21:54.831
My all-time favorite ballplayer
was Earl Monroe.

01:21:54.912 --> 01:21:58.191
Earl the Pearl.

01:21:58.271 --> 01:22:00.951
Yeah, he was nice. See, everybody
remember him from the Knicks,

01:22:01.031 --> 01:22:03.073
you know, when he helped win
that second championship.

01:22:03.153 --> 01:22:06.153
I'm talking about when he was with the
Bullets down at Winston-Salem Stadium...

01:22:06.194 --> 01:22:08.793
before that game, with 42 points
a game the whole season.

01:22:08.873 --> 01:22:10.752
41.6...

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:14.432
the whole season.

01:22:14.512 --> 01:22:17.193
But the Knicks, they put the shackles on
him, man, you know, on his whole game.

01:22:17.273 --> 01:22:20.433
They locked him up,
like in a straitjacket or something.

01:22:22.114 --> 01:22:25.713
When he was in the streets of Philly,
the playgrounds,

01:22:25.794 --> 01:22:28.914
he was like--

01:22:30.033 --> 01:22:32.593
- You know what they called him?
- What?

01:22:32.674 --> 01:22:37.394
Jesus. That's what they called him--
Jesus. 'Cause he was the truth.

01:22:39.873 --> 01:22:42.194
Then the white media got a hold of it.
Then they got to call him Black Jesus.

01:22:42.274 --> 01:22:44.594
He can't just be Jesus.
He got to be Black Jesus.

01:22:44.673 --> 01:22:48.395
You know, but still...
he was the truth.

01:22:52.314 --> 01:22:55.154
So that's the real reason
why you got your name.

01:22:55.234 --> 01:22:58.035
You named me Jesus after Earl Monroe,
and not Jesus in the Bible?

01:22:58.113 --> 01:23:00.873
Not Jesus of the Bible,
Jesus of North Philadelphia.

01:23:00.914 --> 01:23:05.234
Jesus of the playgrounds.
That's the truth, son.

01:23:05.315 --> 01:23:07.475
The way he dished, the way
he, you know, he spinned.

01:23:07.554 --> 01:23:10.635
You know how you do,
coming off and all that. Taw!

01:23:20.915 --> 01:23:24.236
I want you to go
to Big State, son.

01:23:24.275 --> 01:23:27.115
That's the real reason
why I'm out here.

01:23:27.155 --> 01:23:29.835
That's the reason
they let me out.

01:23:29.875 --> 01:23:33.196
You find it in your heart to go
to Big State, and, uh...

01:23:35.156 --> 01:23:37.035
they may let me out
on an early parole.

01:23:37.075 --> 01:23:38.955
-So that's what this is all about, huh?
-That's a part of it.

01:23:38.996 --> 01:23:41.196
- Jake, you just like everybody else.
- I ain't like everybody else.

01:23:41.236 --> 01:23:43.596
I ain't like everybody else.
Everybody else ain't your father.

01:23:43.635 --> 01:23:45.515
Everybody else ain't
bring you in this world.

01:23:45.556 --> 01:23:47.917
Everybody else don't care
about you, son.

01:23:47.957 --> 01:23:50.476
Like that girl you running with.
You know her, Lay-- Layla?

01:23:50.516 --> 01:23:52.396
- Lala!
- Lala. You know her?

01:23:52.436 --> 01:23:55.917
- Yeah, I know her.
- Yeah, she know you like a book too.

01:23:55.956 --> 01:23:59.596
Many a great man, son,
their downfall was 'cause of a woman.

01:23:59.637 --> 01:24:01.677
- You talking about Samson and Delilah.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:24:01.717 --> 01:24:05.197
Him too. Him too.
You see I don't cut my hair, right?

01:24:06.557 --> 01:24:08.716
So you do know
your Bible, huh?

01:24:08.756 --> 01:24:14.157
Look, son, just be careful.
That's all I'm saying to you, all right?

01:24:14.197 --> 01:24:16.237
All right?

01:24:19.799 --> 01:24:22.398
Do you know if you're
gonna go to Big State?

01:24:22.478 --> 01:24:25.118
I mean, is that like a finalist,
or the final four for you?

01:24:25.196 --> 01:24:27.678
- They are in my top ten.
- In your top ten?

01:24:27.758 --> 01:24:31.076
All right. That's good.
One out of ten, that's--

01:24:31.157 --> 01:24:34.237
I can live with them odds.

01:24:34.318 --> 01:24:36.838
- What's up, Booger?
- Hi, Uncle Jake.

01:24:36.919 --> 01:24:38.757
All right, I'm, uh--

01:24:51.559 --> 01:24:53.598
Just give that to Mary.

01:25:00.078 --> 01:25:02.160
- What's up, Booger?
- What's up?

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.599
She knows it's only a treat.

01:25:05.679 --> 01:25:08.320
She doesn't get it all the time.
Just once in a while.

01:25:08.399 --> 01:25:10.158
Aww.

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:13.079
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:25:13.239 --> 01:25:15.278
- Man, thank God it's Friday.
- Friday?

01:25:15.359 --> 01:25:16.880
You better thank God
you're here, man.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.960
I'm just glad you was able
to make it, man.

01:25:19.041 --> 01:25:21.040
Sorry it was
so last-minute though.

01:25:21.079 --> 01:25:24.319
Man, don't be crazy, man.
I know all the schools sweating you.

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.679
- How many you visit?
- Four.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.080
You gonna take the extra
ten they gave you?

01:25:29.119 --> 01:25:31.479
- You know I don't need no ten visits.
- Yeah, right.

01:25:31.519 --> 01:25:33.640
Hi, Chick.

01:25:33.721 --> 01:25:35.561
- That was my last one.
- Yeah?

01:25:35.641 --> 01:25:37.680
Who was that?
She was sweating you.

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:39.801
You like this?
You like this, don't you?

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.839
- Yeah, it's really nice.
- Yeah, I could tell.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:46.240
This ain't the projects, man. We got
like grass and trees, and fresh air.

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.161
This is Morgan.
This is Monty.

01:25:48.241 --> 01:25:50.081
- How you doing?
- How you doing, Jesus?

01:25:50.161 --> 01:25:52.242
- We'll check you later.
- Later on. Them boys can play, man.

01:25:52.321 --> 01:25:54.200
What's up, Chick? Hey, Chick.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.120
Hey, girls, how you doing?

01:25:56.161 --> 01:25:58.041
- Hey.
- Oh, man.

01:25:58.081 --> 01:25:59.960
Mm!

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Goodness. I know the both
of y'all know Jesus Shuttlesworth.

01:26:02.082 --> 01:26:04.081
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

01:26:04.162 --> 01:26:06.082
That's not right, Chick.
That's not right, Chick.

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:08.041
Hey, how about Sunday?
Take y'all out of church?

01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:11.561
- Wait. You're Jesus of Coney lsland?
- Yeah, that's me.

01:26:11.641 --> 01:26:13.642
Look, you've got to come
to this school.

01:26:13.721 --> 01:26:16.161
With you and Chick, we'll
definitely go to the Final Four.

01:26:16.242 --> 01:26:18.122
- Go? We'll win the whole thing.
- That's you, dog.

01:26:18.202 --> 01:26:20.202
- You are going to go here, aren't you?
- Well, we hope so.

01:26:20.282 --> 01:26:22.123
It's my job to convince him.

01:26:22.203 --> 01:26:24.202
And this is his last
visit to any schools.

01:26:24.282 --> 01:26:27.281
- Jesus, Tech-U is a really cool place.
You will love it here.
- Really?

01:26:27.362 --> 01:26:30.762
- I mean, we really know how to party.
- Oh, you do?

01:26:30.841 --> 01:26:32.844
- Uh-oh.
- It's, uh, really cool.

01:26:32.923 --> 01:26:35.643
- I hope I see you around.
- All right.

01:26:38.043 --> 01:26:39.882
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:26:39.963 --> 01:26:42.442
- Bye, Chick.
- Bye, Chick.

01:26:43.642 --> 01:26:46.202
Come on. Let's go meet
Coach Billy Sunday, man.

01:26:46.283 --> 01:26:48.763
- Forget Billy Sunday.
We need to follow them.
- Man, he's a cool white boy.

01:26:48.843 --> 01:26:52.283
Now this is what I'm
talking about. Tech dome, baby!

01:26:52.363 --> 01:26:55.163
- Wow!
- Thousands of seats. Crowded, yo.

01:26:55.204 --> 01:26:57.483
When they get in here,
they tear the roof off, yo.

01:26:59.283 --> 01:27:01.043
See those seats
down there, man?

01:27:01.084 --> 01:27:02.964
- Yeah?
- The ones in the front.

01:27:03.004 --> 01:27:05.283
That's where all the alumni sit,
with all the money, man.

01:27:05.364 --> 01:27:09.045
- Where? Right here?
- Yeah, man. I even got
my favorite seat, right here.

01:27:09.083 --> 01:27:12.563
Wait. You can sit on mine.
I'm gonna warm this one up.

01:27:12.643 --> 01:27:14.643
Feel that?
Feel the difference?

01:27:14.723 --> 01:27:18.844
Now, introducing-- Number 34!

01:27:18.925 --> 01:27:24.764
From Coney lsland,
Brooklyn, New York--

01:27:24.845 --> 01:27:29.444
Jee-suuus Shuttlesworth!

01:28:06.565 --> 01:28:08.446
Hello, son.
This is for you.

01:28:08.526 --> 01:28:09.886
Coach Sunday.

01:28:09.967 --> 01:28:12.286
I hope that Chick here
has been a gracious host.

01:28:12.365 --> 01:28:14.406
Oh, Chick has been great.

01:28:14.486 --> 01:28:17.245
Good. 'Cause we really know how
to treat our student athletes right.

01:28:17.326 --> 01:28:19.767
- lsn't that right, Chick?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

01:28:19.847 --> 01:28:21.726
Coach is telling
the truth, man.

01:28:21.767 --> 01:28:25.686
I hope you don't think we're too forward
or aggressive with the highlight film...

01:28:25.766 --> 01:28:27.646
- or the jersey.
- No way.

01:28:27.686 --> 01:28:31.407
- That's the way we are here
at Tech U. We show love.
- Much love. Much love.

01:28:31.486 --> 01:28:32.847
Why beat around the bush?

01:28:32.927 --> 01:28:35.367
We scouted you since you were
in junior high school.

01:28:35.448 --> 01:28:38.047
We know all about you.
We love you.

01:28:38.127 --> 01:28:42.606
You're a great kid. Not only a
great ballplayer, a great student,

01:28:42.686 --> 01:28:44.846
but a beautiful human being.

01:28:44.927 --> 01:28:48.687
When I read about how you've been
raising your sister all by yourself,

01:28:48.768 --> 01:28:50.968
it made me want to cry.

01:28:51.048 --> 01:28:54.368
I said to myself,
"That's the kind of young man...

01:28:54.408 --> 01:28:56.888
"that will be the backbone
of this great country,

01:28:56.967 --> 01:28:59.448
- not just the Tech University
basketball team."
- Tell it.

01:28:59.527 --> 01:29:01.608
-You understand what I'm trying to say?
-Yes, sir.

01:29:01.687 --> 01:29:04.568
When I heard...
that you were coming to visit,

01:29:09.409 --> 01:29:13.048
I got down...
on my hands and knees...

01:29:15.168 --> 01:29:17.207
and I prayed to God.

01:29:21.968 --> 01:29:24.728
- Chick.
- Right here.

01:29:24.768 --> 01:29:27.928
- Dear Lord, please...
- Please.

01:29:27.968 --> 01:29:29.929
deliver Jesus to us.

01:29:30.008 --> 01:29:34.810
I got down on my knees,
and I asked God...

01:29:36.889 --> 01:29:41.090
to let Tech University
be the throne of Jesus.

01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:44.050
As you already know, this will be
the most important decision...

01:29:44.130 --> 01:29:46.249
of your life
that you'll ever make.

01:29:46.329 --> 01:29:47.729
Yeah.

01:29:47.809 --> 01:29:51.210
Son... don't blow it.

01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:53.370
- Hi, Chick. How you doing?
- Hey, what's up, Molly?

01:29:53.409 --> 01:29:54.690
- Hey, Chick.
- What's up, Liz?

01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:57.890
- This is Jesus Shuttlesworth.
- Hi, Jesus.

01:29:57.969 --> 01:30:01.850
- We're glad you're here.
- We're having a little talk.

01:30:01.890 --> 01:30:05.530
Let us finish, and then we can
get up with y'all later. All right?

01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:08.010
Okay. All right.
Nice meeting you.

01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:09.930
- Bye.
- Nice seeing y'all.

01:30:12.130 --> 01:30:14.250
Mm!

01:30:14.331 --> 01:30:16.650
Lovely, huh?
Travel in packs too.

01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:19.291
Mm!

01:30:20.731 --> 01:30:23.491
You hit those?

01:30:23.571 --> 01:30:25.371
- About 50% from the field.
- You lying.

01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:27.691
You can have the rest.
I swear. Look, man.

01:30:27.771 --> 01:30:30.330
We got some serious freaks
up here in this piece, man.

01:30:30.411 --> 01:30:32.570
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:30:33.931 --> 01:30:35.851
I was into my black bag
also, man.

01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:38.411
Yo, I was keeping beautiful,
fine dark sisters.

01:30:38.491 --> 01:30:42.732
Nubian sisters. Africa.
The whole nine. I'm telling you, man.

01:30:42.812 --> 01:30:46.090
Well, you know,
I got a lady back in Brooklyn.

01:30:46.171 --> 01:30:50.572
- Her name is Lala. We in love.
- I got a lady too.

01:30:50.652 --> 01:30:52.492
She at home,
and she ain't here.

01:30:52.572 --> 01:30:54.573
And I ain't talking about no love.
I'm talking about...

01:30:54.652 --> 01:30:56.652
these white freaks
here at Tech U, man.

01:30:56.732 --> 01:30:58.652
They love some ball-playing
brothers, man.

01:30:58.732 --> 01:31:01.092
- Let you get your swerve on, man.
- I hear all that, but--

01:31:01.132 --> 01:31:03.292
- What about the sisters?
- What about them?

01:31:03.373 --> 01:31:06.213
I love them, but they
make you work too hard, man.

01:31:06.252 --> 01:31:08.892
Them white girls over there, man,
they do your dirty drawers.

01:31:08.973 --> 01:31:10.853
Wash 'em.
Cook for you.

01:31:10.893 --> 01:31:12.773
- Give you money, man.
- Nuh-uh!

01:31:12.813 --> 01:31:14.973
- Let you drive the Benz
their daddy bought.
- Oh, hell, no!

01:31:15.052 --> 01:31:16.653
- They go the extra mile, man.
- You lying.

01:31:16.733 --> 01:31:18.653
You see Molly
over there, man?

01:31:18.694 --> 01:31:20.413
You can call her up at 4:00
in the morning, man.

01:31:20.494 --> 01:31:22.493
"Bitch, get over here.
Let me spank you."

01:31:22.573 --> 01:31:25.213
Man, before you hang the phone up,
she beating on the door.

01:31:25.293 --> 01:31:28.013
- You don't even got
to kick your own bed out.
- Man, you lying.

01:31:28.412 --> 01:31:30.652
- Buck!
- What's up, Buck?

01:31:30.693 --> 01:31:33.093
- Peace, bro! Peace.
- What's up, man?

01:31:33.173 --> 01:31:35.654
- We need to stay out in the hallway.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:31:35.733 --> 01:31:38.294
- Everybody in the hallway.
- This is a party. It's a long hallway.

01:31:38.374 --> 01:31:41.335
You're good. Hey, where
the hell you at last night?

01:31:41.414 --> 01:31:44.414
Always messin' around.
That's why I can't mess with y'all, man.

01:31:44.494 --> 01:31:46.493
- We need to be out here.
- Don't worry about that.

01:31:46.573 --> 01:31:48.574
I want you meeting
the assistant coaches.

01:31:48.654 --> 01:31:52.455
- What are the assistant coaches
doing in the hallway?
- Yeah. Right here, man.

01:31:52.494 --> 01:31:54.495
Lines and choruses
Days full of Doris's

01:31:54.574 --> 01:31:58.094
Jesus, say hello
to Buffy and Suzie.

01:31:58.175 --> 01:32:00.895
- Don't worry about the names.
- What's up?

01:32:00.974 --> 01:32:04.535
Boy. I know you'll
take care of business.

01:32:04.614 --> 01:32:06.855
Brooklyn is in the house.

01:32:06.935 --> 01:32:09.815
Boy, keep it real.
Keep it real. It's up to you.

01:32:09.895 --> 01:32:12.374
- Do what a black man gotta do.
- Where you goin'?

01:32:12.455 --> 01:32:14.454
- Be right out here.
- You leavin'?

01:32:14.535 --> 01:32:17.174
Holler if you need me, man.

01:32:17.255 --> 01:32:18.534
Hey there.

01:32:18.616 --> 01:32:20.616
- Sit down. Relax.
- Hi.

01:32:20.696 --> 01:32:23.656
- Yeah. Sit down right here.
- Don't be nervous.

01:32:23.736 --> 01:32:26.935
Beats in the game of rap, put my soul
in it, care less about the gold in it

01:32:27.015 --> 01:32:29.736
Boom the shottie
Got the motherfuckin' paparazzi

01:32:29.816 --> 01:32:32.135
- How're you doin'?
- I'm doin' fine.

01:32:32.175 --> 01:32:34.057
- Yeah?
- Yeah. How are you?

01:32:34.096 --> 01:32:37.256
-Good. How do you like your stay so far?
-It's been wonderful.

01:32:37.336 --> 01:32:38.937
He's so nervous.

01:32:39.015 --> 01:32:41.216
He's so tense. Very sexy.

01:32:41.295 --> 01:32:46.336
I know. Just can't wait till next
season when you're going to school here.

01:32:46.416 --> 01:32:49.177
- Can you?
- I can't wait.

01:32:49.257 --> 01:32:52.417
- I know. Hmm.
- I can't wait.

01:32:52.497 --> 01:32:54.376
Oh, Jesus!

01:32:54.417 --> 01:32:57.177
Yes!

01:32:59.977 --> 01:33:02.657
Yes, Jesus! Oh!

01:33:02.736 --> 01:33:03.937
Eat it!

01:33:23.378 --> 01:33:25.858
This guy, he's leaving me now.
He's right there.

01:33:25.897 --> 01:33:28.937
And I'm just gonna...
you know, do whatever.

01:33:29.018 --> 01:33:32.698
I'll call you later. I'll call
you later. All right. See you. Bye.

01:33:32.777 --> 01:33:37.339
Hey, how you doin'? I'm Jake
Shuttlesworth. I'm Jesus's father.

01:33:38.699 --> 01:33:40.737
Yeah, how are you?

01:33:42.538 --> 01:33:45.698
- May I ask you a question,
talk to you about something?
- About what?

01:33:45.778 --> 01:33:48.738
Well, number one, my son, he loves you
very much. You know that, right?

01:33:48.778 --> 01:33:53.099
- Yeah. I feel the same way.
- Do you? That's good. That's lovely.

01:33:53.179 --> 01:33:56.619
You haven't talked to him today?
Seen him, nothin' like that?

01:33:56.699 --> 01:33:59.779
I was talkin' to him last night. He told
me that he was heading outta town today.

01:33:59.819 --> 01:34:02.419
I don't remember where he was sayin'
he was goin' 'cause I was half-asleep.

01:34:02.498 --> 01:34:04.300
- Nah, I haven't seen him.
- You sure?

01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:06.300
- I haven't seen him.
- Okay.

01:34:06.379 --> 01:34:08.699
Okay. He's waitin' for you?

01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:13.859
- He's my big brother.
- He's your big brother?

01:34:15.099 --> 01:34:19.140
Oh, okay. Yeah.
Yeah, I can see the resemblance.

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.660
- What are y'all? Dominican? Cuban?
- No.

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:24.021
- Borinquen, baby, thank you.
- Borinquen. Yeah, whatever.

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:25.700
- So, like, listen, Layla--
- Lala.

01:34:25.781 --> 01:34:27.180
- Whatever.
- That's my name.

01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:30.061
Whatever they payin' you,
I can do better than that.

01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:32.780
Pay whom what? You ain't got
no real money anyway anyhow.

01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:35.141
You ain't got to say that to me.
School's out. You know what I'm sayin'?

01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:38.060
Here's what I'm sayin'.
We can help each other, all right?

01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:41.540
You ain't got to play games with me.
Just listen to me for a second.

01:34:41.581 --> 01:34:43.461
We can help each other.

01:34:43.501 --> 01:34:47.020
If we work together, we can both get
what we want. You know what I'm sayin'?

01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:49.902
Look, I don't know who you
been talking to or who you think I am,

01:34:49.981 --> 01:34:52.781
but I'm the only one here who really,
really cares about Jesus.

01:34:52.861 --> 01:34:54.382
- Is that right?
- Yes.

01:34:54.462 --> 01:34:56.300
- Why don't you help me then,
since you really care about him?
- No.

01:34:56.381 --> 01:34:58.941
What you need to do is let go of my arm.
Let go of my arm!

01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:00.901
- No disrespect. No disrespect.
- Thank you.

01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:04.100
I think you heard
what she's saying.

01:35:04.141 --> 01:35:06.581
Look, son, why don't you--
What you got there, a Range Rover?

01:35:06.661 --> 01:35:08.662
- "Son"?
- Why don't you get in your Range Rover.

01:35:08.742 --> 01:35:10.903
- You ain't my pops.
- Don't be trying to blow up the spot!

01:35:10.981 --> 01:35:12.861
I'm not trying
to disrespect you--

01:35:12.941 --> 01:35:16.822
Huh? I didn't hear what you said.

01:35:16.902 --> 01:35:19.061
- What you say?
- D'Andre!

01:35:19.141 --> 01:35:21.942
- You can't talk now, huh?

01:35:22.023 --> 01:35:24.503
Are you okay?

01:35:24.583 --> 01:35:28.101
D'And-- D'Andre?

01:35:28.182 --> 01:35:30.062
What do you want, what do you need
What will you find

01:35:30.103 --> 01:35:32.102
Don't be afraid, don't fall asleep
Open your mind

01:35:32.182 --> 01:35:35.382
I hope this rhyme gets you in time
in space, come to a different place

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:37.583
Will you hear spiritual lyrical
knowledge in your face to face

01:35:37.664 --> 01:35:40.263
Like welfare In these rappers' lyrics
they need health care

01:35:40.343 --> 01:35:43.383
Does KRS represent heaven
Hell, yeah

01:35:43.463 --> 01:35:46.543
Let me take you elsewhere where
you stand is a curse there for sure

01:35:46.623 --> 01:35:48.343
Unless you're mature, grow up

01:35:48.423 --> 01:35:50.743
If you're immature
then you live in sinister

01:35:50.823 --> 01:35:52.904
- Booger. Booger, what's happenin'?
- Hey, hey.

- How you doin', man? You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:35:54.903 --> 01:35:56.783
- Everything's good?
- Ah, you know, it's all right.

01:35:56.823 --> 01:35:59.184
- Yeah. Seen my son?
- No, I ain't seen him.

01:35:59.224 --> 01:36:00.743
- You ain't seen him?
- I ain't seen him.

01:36:00.823 --> 01:36:02.822
Lyin' motherfucker.
You've seen him. Where he at?

01:36:08.784 --> 01:36:10.624
- Where is he at?
- I talked to him yesterday.

01:36:10.704 --> 01:36:12.823
- Where'd he say he was goin'?
- Yo, yo! Balloons. Two for a dollar.

01:36:12.904 --> 01:36:15.384
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Let go. You're hurting my--

01:36:15.464 --> 01:36:17.944
All right. I'm sorry.
You want some of this here?

01:36:18.023 --> 01:36:21.344
My bad. It's my bad.
You all right? You straight?

01:36:21.425 --> 01:36:23.745
- You got some money?
- No. No.

01:36:23.824 --> 01:36:26.144
Public Enemy on the disk

01:36:49.105 --> 01:36:53.025
Not as fast as I expected, but it's
all gonna work out; I feel that.

01:36:53.106 --> 01:36:55.385
When's your son
comin' back into town?

01:36:55.465 --> 01:36:57.306
Y'all heard about that?

01:36:57.385 --> 01:37:00.545
Oh, yeah,

You know, an advance or something
like that? I'm broke.

01:37:05.905 --> 01:37:08.706
I hope you're not lookin' to buy no
plane, train or bus ticket outta here.

01:37:08.786 --> 01:37:11.106
-Naw, nothin' like that.
-You're tryin' to pull a fast one on us?

01:37:11.186 --> 01:37:13.146
- It's just I met a friend.
- Female friend?

01:37:13.226 --> 01:37:16.625
A female friend, and I'd like to take
her someplace other than Nathan's.

01:37:16.706 --> 01:37:20.307
Invite her up for one of them grilled
cheese sandwiches and orange soda.

01:37:20.388 --> 01:37:22.267
Now, I know you haven't fell...

01:37:22.346 --> 01:37:24.306
for that broken-down 'ho
you been messin' around with.

01:37:24.387 --> 01:37:26.826
- What is a "'ho"?
Is that like a gardening tool?
- 'Ho, man. Whore.

01:37:26.906 --> 01:37:28.787
Bitch that sells pussy.
Right, Jake?

01:37:28.826 --> 01:37:34.067
She ain't no bitch and she ain't no 'ho.
The lady's name is Dakota. Dakota.

01:37:34.146 --> 01:37:36.507
All right, Jake.
You don't have to get defensive.

01:37:36.588 --> 01:37:39.667
We know you've been locked up
five and a half years. Pussy is pussy.

01:37:39.748 --> 01:37:42.227
That's some
hard shit, my man, you know?

01:37:42.307 --> 01:37:44.707
No poontang
in five and a half years.

01:37:44.787 --> 01:37:47.027
I know you ain't been out
messin' around with them little boys.

01:37:47.107 --> 01:37:49.266
- I ain't messin' with no little boys.
- Nobody tossed your salad?

01:37:49.347 --> 01:37:51.348
Ain't nobody did
a motherfuckin' thing.

01:37:51.428 --> 01:37:54.028
- I read in prison...
- I didn't engage in no
homosexual activities.

01:37:54.107 --> 01:37:55.987
- that the guy who's doin' it--
- Y'all gonna give me the money?

01:37:56.028 --> 01:37:58.707
Not the guy who's gettin' it up the
old kazoo, but the guy who's doin' it,

01:37:58.788 --> 01:38:01.228
he doesn't consider himself
to be a faggot.

01:38:01.306 --> 01:38:03.348
- Crudup.
- You think that's true?

01:38:03.428 --> 01:38:05.828
Crudup. Just make sure
she's clean, my man.

01:38:05.908 --> 01:38:09.709
That could be some dirty-ass pussy.
Go and knock yourself out.

01:38:09.789 --> 01:38:11.669
Thank you.

01:38:11.828 --> 01:38:14.628
It's all the film thing,
baby. It's all the film thing.

01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:17.189
You see what I'm sayin'?
Lights, camera, action!

01:38:17.269 --> 01:38:19.108
All right, Sweetness.
Here we go, baby.

01:38:19.188 --> 01:38:22.029
- I'm makin' you some money tonight.
- Hey, baby.

01:38:22.069 --> 01:38:24.429
How much for a blow job?
You wanna go for a ride?

01:38:24.469 --> 01:38:26.349
You wanna have some fun?

01:38:26.389 --> 01:38:29.469
- I wanna get my swerve on.
- Wanna go out?

01:38:32.948 --> 01:38:37.070
Hey, baby,
you wanna party with me tonight?

01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:38.989
This is my last 20 bucks.

01:38:39.029 --> 01:38:41.229
You take that $20
back to your wife, honey.

01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:42.909
This is your mama you're talkin' to.
Come here, baby.

01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:45.229
- Dakota.
- What about you?

01:38:45.269 --> 01:38:47.309
- What?
- Let's get outta here.

01:38:47.349 --> 01:38:49.549
- Will you beat it. Damn!
- Let's get outta here.

01:38:49.588 --> 01:38:53.230
- You are bad for business, okay?
- I got money, all right?

01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:55.471
Let's get outta here.

01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:58.230
Hey! What's
in the bag, all right?

01:38:58.311 --> 01:39:00.149
Man!

01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:04.950
Take a seat right there.

01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:08.151
Yeah, huh?
Come on. Sit down.

01:39:08.231 --> 01:39:10.151
Thanks.

01:39:15.031 --> 01:39:17.391
Some of this right there.

01:39:18.630 --> 01:39:20.471
For the lady...

01:39:22.232 --> 01:39:24.272
and for the man.

01:39:24.311 --> 01:39:27.151
- Mm, thanks.
- And for the boys upstate.

01:39:27.190 --> 01:39:30.230
- Hey, don't waste it.
- Shit, they need it.

01:39:32.711 --> 01:39:34.831
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:39:39.791 --> 01:39:43.073
So, um...

01:39:43.151 --> 01:39:47.151
I like talking to you and all,
but don't let that fool you, you know.

01:39:47.231 --> 01:39:49.792
There's no free pussy
around here, no freebies.

01:39:49.871 --> 01:39:52.592
Sweetness will have my ass.

01:39:52.673 --> 01:39:54.792
How much?

01:39:54.873 --> 01:39:56.953
How much you wanna spend?

01:40:05.913 --> 01:40:08.113
The whole shot.

01:40:14.112 --> 01:40:16.913
How long have you
been locked up?

01:40:18.672 --> 01:40:20.914
2,213 days.

01:40:22.073 --> 01:40:24.914
That's six years,
23 days...

01:40:24.953 --> 01:40:27.154
in the State.

01:40:27.194 --> 01:40:29.113
Wow.

01:40:29.153 --> 01:40:31.993
How many tricks you turn
in that time?

01:40:33.473 --> 01:40:36.314
- All I count is the money.
- Yeah?

01:40:38.434 --> 01:40:41.915
Why don't you
just pretend like--

01:40:41.994 --> 01:40:44.754
Iike you mean it
or something?

01:40:44.833 --> 01:40:47.634
- I'm a good actress.
- Are you?

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:49.714
Yeah.

01:40:49.753 --> 01:40:52.275
Why don't you
take that wig off...

01:40:54.874 --> 01:40:57.555
and be real for a minute.

01:41:00.194 --> 01:41:03.395
I guess that's a requirement
of the job, huh? Right?

01:41:05.594 --> 01:41:07.755
To be a good actress?

01:41:10.075 --> 01:41:12.036
Act like it
means something?

01:41:12.115 --> 01:41:14.195
Hmm?

01:41:15.714 --> 01:41:18.035
Stand up.

01:41:18.115 --> 01:41:20.474
Naw, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:41:24.316 --> 01:41:26.515
Mmm.

01:41:29.275 --> 01:41:31.275
Go slow.

01:41:32.315 --> 01:41:34.835
It's a long time,
you know?

01:41:34.875 --> 01:41:36.917
Mmm.

01:41:38.436 --> 01:41:40.436
Two thousand.

01:41:43.116 --> 01:41:45.316
Oh, damn.

01:41:48.637 --> 01:41:52.117
Hey, look, why don't we
take this on over there.

01:42:55.799 --> 01:42:57.800
Oh!

01:43:15.199 --> 01:43:17.520
It's okay.

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.760
- It's okay.
- Sorry, l--

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:22.640
No. Nothin'
to be sorry about.

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.640
It's been a long time.

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:32.320
Anyway, we got all night.

01:43:32.361 --> 01:43:34.520
I'm turning the meter off.

01:43:54.841 --> 01:43:57.201
How was your trip, son?

01:43:57.281 --> 01:44:00.321
Good.
Whose car is this?

01:44:00.402 --> 01:44:03.001
- What, this brand-new Lexus?
- Yeah.

01:44:03.041 --> 01:44:04.922
Well, technically,
it's mine.

01:44:04.961 --> 01:44:07.681
It's registered in my name,
but it's for you.

01:44:07.762 --> 01:44:09.762
- For me?
- How you like it?

01:44:09.922 --> 01:44:11.801
LS400.

01:44:11.841 --> 01:44:14.363
Look at that.
Power moon roof.

01:44:14.401 --> 01:44:17.561
Got that, uh,
vehicle theft deterrent.

01:44:17.602 --> 01:44:20.842
That's to deter them Coney lsland
Puerto Ricans from stealing your shit.

01:44:20.921 --> 01:44:23.322
I never asked for a car.
Did I ever ask for a car?

01:44:23.403 --> 01:44:26.723
- I asked for you.
- You must be outta your mojo mind.

01:44:26.803 --> 01:44:29.483
If anybody sees me in this car,
that's my ass.

01:44:29.563 --> 01:44:33.722
The way it was explained to me, as long
as it's in my name, it's all good.

01:44:33.762 --> 01:44:35.961
This shit
is all fucked up.

01:44:36.002 --> 01:44:38.203
You gotta take it back,
give it back, do what you gotta do.

01:44:38.243 --> 01:44:39.883
I don't even wanna know
who you got it from either.

01:44:39.963 --> 01:44:43.363
You don't like the color?
What you want? Blue, black, white?

01:44:43.442 --> 01:44:46.682
- You take it back.
- Sh--

01:46:06.405 --> 01:46:10.206
- Mm, so how was your trip?
- My trip? Oh, I had a great trip.

01:46:10.287 --> 01:46:13.086
Best one, so far?
You think?

01:46:13.167 --> 01:46:15.966
I don't know. I mean,
they're all the same,

01:46:16.046 --> 01:46:18.846
but you just have a good time
with all of them.

01:46:18.927 --> 01:46:22.527
We all do the same things-- go partyin',
meet all the guys, go to classes.

01:46:22.568 --> 01:46:25.406
I mean, it was just--
It's off the hook.

01:46:25.447 --> 01:46:28.287
- Did you miss me, Jesus?
- Of course I missed you.

01:46:28.327 --> 01:46:30.686
That's all I did
was talk about Lala.

01:46:32.767 --> 01:46:36.566
Did you meet any women at the parties,
in the dorms and stuff like that?

01:46:36.646 --> 01:46:38.648
Did I meet any women?

01:46:38.727 --> 01:46:41.247
There were women at this college.
There are women all over the place.

01:46:41.327 --> 01:46:44.767
I mean, there's women on the floor,
in the dorms, women in the classroom.

01:46:44.848 --> 01:46:47.888
There's a women's basketball team,
track team. Women all over the place.

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:50.207
Of course I met women.
I got introduced to everybody.

01:46:50.287 --> 01:46:52.166
I said hello. That's about it.

01:46:52.208 --> 01:46:55.728
- So did you fuck anybody
while you were out there?
- Hell, no!

01:46:59.808 --> 01:47:02.728
Don't think I haven't heard stories
about these white college bitches.

01:47:02.809 --> 01:47:04.647
Me with a white bitch?

01:47:04.728 --> 01:47:06.927
They got 'em all lined up,
waitin' to suck your dick.

01:47:07.007 --> 01:47:09.929
If my mother ever saw me with
a white bitch, she'd spin in her grave.

01:47:10.008 --> 01:47:12.808
Then she's spinning.
She's turnin' over and over and over.

01:47:12.888 --> 01:47:16.129
Don't be talking about my mother,
all right? Please.

01:47:16.209 --> 01:47:18.608
All right.

01:47:18.688 --> 01:47:22.088
D'Andre and Dom need to know something.

01:47:22.168 --> 01:47:24.769
Goddamn.
I should've known.

01:47:24.849 --> 01:47:27.649
- What?
- This whole world is bugged.

01:47:29.169 --> 01:47:32.208
And you're in it with 'em.
You're in cahoots with D'Andre and Dom.

01:47:32.289 --> 01:47:34.449
Don't even lie.
Tell me the truth.

01:47:34.529 --> 01:47:36.369
I knew that ever since
I left that house.

01:47:36.448 --> 01:47:38.850
Ever since I walked in the house,
as a matter of fact.

01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:42.450
And why shouldn't
I get paid, huh?

01:47:42.530 --> 01:47:45.450
Why shouldn't Lala get something
outta this? Everybody else is.

01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:48.090
I can't believe this.
I really can't.

01:47:48.170 --> 01:47:51.009
Well, you believe it.
I believed you when you said...

01:47:51.090 --> 01:47:53.610
that you would never
leave me, Jesus.

01:47:53.691 --> 01:47:56.290
And I believed you when you asked me
to get that abortion.

01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:58.531
When you begged me
to get that abortion, I believed you.

01:47:58.570 --> 01:48:01.371
- We both agreed on that.
- I wanted that child.

01:48:01.450 --> 01:48:04.411
- I wanted to know
what you think because it's--
- What I think?

01:48:04.490 --> 01:48:07.852
A baby's gonna hurt
my chance of going to college.

01:48:07.931 --> 01:48:12.291
I mean, the top schools,
they're gonna be scared away. Damn!

01:48:12.371 --> 01:48:16.650
I'm too young. You're too young.
We ain't ready for nothin' like this.

01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:18.811
How did we get pregnant anyway?
Let's talk about that.

01:48:18.890 --> 01:48:21.090
Are you sure?

01:48:21.170 --> 01:48:23.851
I'm not getting pregnant
now, papi.

01:48:23.931 --> 01:48:27.011
I just wanna
feel you inside of me...

01:48:29.491 --> 01:48:31.451
without a jimmy.

01:48:34.251 --> 01:48:36.531
"l can't get pregnant, papi.

01:48:36.612 --> 01:48:38.652
I wanna feel you
inside of me, papi."

01:48:38.731 --> 01:48:42.252
- lsn't that what you said?
- Lala has to look out for herself.

01:48:42.332 --> 01:48:45.172
Lala played herself,
that's what she did.

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:48.771
And don't think I don't know about
that D'Andre kid either.

01:48:48.812 --> 01:48:51.131
- Did you fuck him?
- So what?

01:48:51.211 --> 01:48:53.373
At least I can admit it.

01:48:53.453 --> 01:48:56.373
- Oh, so it makes it all right
that you admit it--
- I'm not saying it's all right.

01:48:56.453 --> 01:48:58.933
I'm just saying that there's a reason
and I can at least admit it.

01:48:59.013 --> 01:49:00.972
- That don't mean shit.
- That don't mean shit?

01:49:01.052 --> 01:49:02.892
- Go fuck all of Coney lsland.
- Well, you know what?

01:49:02.973 --> 01:49:04.812
If it don't matter,
then why are you stressing?

01:49:04.892 --> 01:49:07.412
- You're gonna wake up a whole
bunch of angry black folk.
- I don't give a fuck!

01:49:07.493 --> 01:49:09.332
You know
you're gonna leave me.

01:49:09.413 --> 01:49:12.133
This is gonna last while you're off
to college for a year?

01:49:12.173 --> 01:49:14.692
You want me to live in Lala-land?
Is that what it is?

01:49:14.732 --> 01:49:17.254
How do you know?
Tell me how you know.

01:49:17.293 --> 01:49:20.773
- I know 'cause I ain't stupid.
- You went to a fortune teller?

01:49:20.852 --> 01:49:22.974
You don't know shit.
You don't know what's gonna happen.

01:49:23.054 --> 01:49:25.373
Jesus, I have read
all about...

01:49:25.453 --> 01:49:28.774
those high school sweethearts
who get left behind.

01:49:28.854 --> 01:49:32.174
I have seen that movie
many a time.

01:49:32.253 --> 01:49:36.293
I told 'em nobody can tell Jesus
what to do, but they fucking insisted.

01:49:36.333 --> 01:49:39.014
If they were stupid enough
to give me money...

01:49:39.054 --> 01:49:42.574
to use some kind of influence
over you that I never possessed,

01:49:42.654 --> 01:49:44.654
so be it.

01:49:44.733 --> 01:49:48.854
They put the money in my hand
with the promise of more to come.

01:49:50.134 --> 01:49:52.095
Just like
everybody else.

01:49:52.175 --> 01:49:54.215
Jesus, you have
no problems.

01:49:54.255 --> 01:49:57.334
Your life is set.
You got no worries.

01:49:57.415 --> 01:49:59.615
- I have nothing.
- Yeah, right.

01:49:59.695 --> 01:50:02.534
You're gonna honestly lie
dead to my face and tell me...

01:50:02.615 --> 01:50:05.014
that it was gonna be forever
and you were gonna take care of me...

01:50:05.095 --> 01:50:07.215
and that I had no problems
or no worries?

01:50:07.294 --> 01:50:10.176
- That wasn't hard for me.
- Oh, my God.

01:50:13.775 --> 01:50:16.935
Come here.
That's it. Come here!

01:50:23.696 --> 01:50:25.775
Good riddance.

01:50:31.976 --> 01:50:33.815
What's up, son?

01:50:36.336 --> 01:50:39.216
So, this is it, yo?
Judgment day?

01:50:40.297 --> 01:50:43.576
Father and son?
Jake and Jesus?

01:50:43.656 --> 01:50:47.057
So you ain't gonna
say nothin' to me. Okay.

01:50:47.136 --> 01:50:51.497
I ain't got no more time to be tryin'
to beg your forgiveness or nothin',

01:50:51.576 --> 01:50:52.936
so I'll make this
real simple.

01:50:53.015 --> 01:50:55.817
This right here,
it's a letter of intent...

01:50:55.896 --> 01:50:58.697
for you to sign
to go to Big State.

01:50:58.777 --> 01:51:00.616
Right?

01:51:00.696 --> 01:51:02.537
Right there.

01:51:02.617 --> 01:51:07.016
I'll play you,
one-on-one, to 11.

01:51:07.097 --> 01:51:09.257
I win, you sign.

01:51:09.337 --> 01:51:12.137
You win, you do what you wanna do.
Tear it up, whatever.

01:51:12.216 --> 01:51:15.018
I go back to Attica, 'cause I know
that's what you really want. Right?

01:51:15.097 --> 01:51:16.937
- You wanna play me one-on-one?
- One-on-one.

01:51:17.017 --> 01:51:19.497
-lf I win, you get the hell outta here?
-I ain't stuttered, son.

01:51:19.577 --> 01:51:23.217
- The hell outta my life?
- Forever.

01:51:23.379 --> 01:51:26.378
- I'll take the bet. You're on.
- Bet.

01:51:29.899 --> 01:51:32.017
You wanna take them shines off,
that gold?

01:51:32.098 --> 01:51:34.657
You gonna take
that LoJack off?

01:51:34.737 --> 01:51:36.497
It don't come off, son.

01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:41.738
Check.

01:51:50.898 --> 01:51:52.499
Aah!

01:51:52.578 --> 01:51:54.419
That's one.

01:51:54.499 --> 01:51:57.378
- That's the only basket
you gettin' all game.
- Check.

01:52:04.539 --> 01:52:06.699
One.

01:52:06.738 --> 01:52:08.619
I can count.
That's one.

01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:14.741
Two.

01:52:14.819 --> 01:52:16.660
Two-one. That's somethin'
you taught me.

01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:18.740
That's right.
I taught you well, son.

01:52:18.819 --> 01:52:21.939
A lot of things you learned from me.
This your ball?

01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:24.820
- What you stallin' for?
- Everything you got you got from me.

01:52:24.901 --> 01:52:26.741
Everything you got.

01:52:26.821 --> 01:52:30.101
- Let me show you what you taught me.
- Yeah, show me. Show me!

01:52:31.221 --> 01:52:33.101
Show me!

01:52:34.861 --> 01:52:37.300
I didn't teach you that,
though, did l?

01:52:37.381 --> 01:52:39.221
That's somethin'
I didn't teach you.

01:52:39.302 --> 01:52:41.301
- That was luck.
- That's somethin' you gotta
learn on your own.

01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:43.381
Give it up. Give it up.

01:52:44.901 --> 01:52:46.741
Oh, why you do--

01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:49.740
Oh, yeah!

01:52:49.781 --> 01:52:52.141
Who taught you that one?

01:52:52.181 --> 01:52:54.103
I think I'll go around again.

01:52:54.181 --> 01:52:57.581
- Yeah!
- It's your ball.

01:53:05.061 --> 01:53:07.862
Mmm, I feel refreshed.

01:53:15.142 --> 01:53:18.982
You better shoot it. That's a brick.

01:53:19.022 --> 01:53:21.701
All right, we gon' cut out
all that lucky shit.

01:53:25.862 --> 01:53:27.702
- What's that?
- That's three.

01:53:27.782 --> 01:53:30.063
- You gon' play me?
- Yeah. I'm just warmin' up, baby.

01:53:31.062 --> 01:53:32.182
I give you that.

01:53:32.262 --> 01:53:34.342
- You better play some defense.
- I give you that.

01:53:34.382 --> 01:53:35.862
Don't give me too many.

01:53:38.502 --> 01:53:41.303
Yeah. Where you at, baby?
That's my rock.

01:53:46.103 --> 01:53:47.983
Yeah, that was luck, anyway.

01:53:49.944 --> 01:53:52.343
That's luck too, baby.

01:53:52.423 --> 01:53:54.264
- Just call me the leprechaun.
- That's your last basket.

01:53:54.345 --> 01:53:55.985
Yeah. I'm a lucky Negro.

01:53:57.184 --> 01:53:59.023
You ready?

01:54:11.304 --> 01:54:13.464
All right.

01:54:13.545 --> 01:54:15.185
Oh, I forgot.

01:54:19.664 --> 01:54:21.864
Payback is a bitch, huh?

01:54:23.864 --> 01:54:25.706
Yeah.

01:54:30.065 --> 01:54:32.904
Oh, don't get mad. You're the one
that taught me to be a good sportsman.

01:54:32.944 --> 01:54:34.704
Ball up.

01:54:35.865 --> 01:54:37.745
What you want,
the jump shot dunk?

01:54:42.105 --> 01:54:43.946
What?

01:54:44.026 --> 01:54:46.025
Huh?

01:54:46.105 --> 01:54:47.946
- Bottoms.
- What's that?

01:54:48.025 --> 01:54:50.425
- Seven to a lucky five.
- Seven to a lucky five.

01:54:56.665 --> 01:54:58.545
- Eight-five.
- Eight-five.

01:54:58.626 --> 01:55:00.947
I'm about to send you
down there with them.

01:55:02.665 --> 01:55:05.106
- Nine-five.
- You quittin'?

01:55:05.186 --> 01:55:07.026
- I can take a loss.
- You just gon' give up, huh?

01:55:07.105 --> 01:55:08.946
- I ain't givin' up.
- You just gon' give up.

01:55:09.026 --> 01:55:12.627
I'm teachin', brother. I'm teachin',
son, like I always taught you.

01:55:15.907 --> 01:55:17.746
Oh, you tired?

01:55:22.626 --> 01:55:24.467
Get that outta here.

01:55:24.548 --> 01:55:26.387
You're earnin' these two.

01:55:28.507 --> 01:55:30.427
Ohh!

01:55:35.587 --> 01:55:38.867
I thought you lifted weights
in Attica, in the joint. Huh?

01:55:38.947 --> 01:55:41.108
Point game.
Just play the game.

01:55:41.148 --> 01:55:43.028
Just play the game?

01:55:44.107 --> 01:55:45.948
I learned that from you.

01:55:48.907 --> 01:55:50.747
You better "D" up, Jake.

01:55:52.028 --> 01:55:54.347
Point game.

01:55:54.427 --> 01:55:56.588
This is your last chance.

01:55:58.428 --> 01:56:00.308
Come on, move away.

01:56:06.748 --> 01:56:08.948
Ohh!

01:56:08.987 --> 01:56:10.868
Ohh!

01:56:10.909 --> 01:56:12.628
Aah!

01:56:12.669 --> 01:56:14.189
Game time.

01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:21.429
What you lookin' around for?

01:56:21.509 --> 01:56:23.348
That's game-- 11-5.

01:56:24.428 --> 01:56:26.270
Jake.

01:56:28.469 --> 01:56:30.349
Somebody call a stretcher.

01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:32.590
Stick a fork in 'im.
He's done.

01:56:34.428 --> 01:56:37.229
Take your old ass
back to Attica.

01:56:49.509 --> 01:56:51.350
All right.

01:56:51.429 --> 01:56:53.269
What?

01:56:54.589 --> 01:56:57.871
Make you feel like a man now?
Huh?

01:56:59.390 --> 01:57:01.231
Maybe you could stop hatin' me.

01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:03.631
Is that gonna bring
your mother back?

01:57:03.670 --> 01:57:06.991
- Maybe we could start bein'
father and son again.
- You ain't my father.

01:57:14.230 --> 01:57:16.111
Let me tell you somethin'.

01:57:16.151 --> 01:57:18.992
You look out for yourself.
You look out for your sister.

01:57:19.031 --> 01:57:21.430
You ain't got to worry
about me no more.

01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:24.791
But you get that hatred
out your heart, boy,

01:57:24.832 --> 01:57:28.071
or you gon' end up
just another nigger,

01:57:28.152 --> 01:57:29.991
Iike your father.

01:57:34.472 --> 01:57:36.311
It's your ball.

01:57:43.952 --> 01:57:48.191
Well, Jake, I think it's time
for all of us to go back home.

01:57:48.271 --> 01:57:50.431
- Okay.
- No. No, Jake.

01:57:50.512 --> 01:57:52.352
Turn around.

01:58:06.833 --> 01:58:08.193
Let's go.

01:58:08.272 --> 01:58:11.073
Let him go. Huh?

01:58:13.633 --> 01:58:15.553
Jesus.

01:58:15.633 --> 01:58:18.234
Jesus!

01:58:36.354 --> 01:58:39.194
I'm gonna read a, uh,
prepared statement from Jesus.

01:58:39.234 --> 01:58:42.195
"I'm sorry for not bein'
with you this morning,

01:58:42.274 --> 01:58:45.154
"but under the circumstances my family
and I have chosen to be alone.

01:58:45.195 --> 01:58:48.634
"This past week has been
a very difficult week for me.

01:58:48.714 --> 01:58:52.154
"I've done a lot of praying
and have asked for guidance from above.

01:58:54.275 --> 01:58:57.595
"And I do believe that God
has shown me the way.

01:58:57.675 --> 01:59:00.315
"My sister Mary
will be coming with me.

01:59:00.356 --> 01:59:03.196
"She will attend seventh grade
at a neighboring junior high school.

01:59:03.236 --> 01:59:08.154
"This September I will
be enrolled at Big State University...

01:59:08.194 --> 01:59:11.035
- on a full--"
- on a full athletic scholarship."

01:59:11.075 --> 01:59:13.236
- Yes!
- Bullshit!

01:59:13.316 --> 01:59:17.076
Later!

01:59:17.155 --> 01:59:19.556
This shit is bogus.
The boy did not go for the bucks.

01:59:24.236 --> 01:59:27.156
Hold on.
"This is the right place for me.

01:59:27.237 --> 01:59:32.596
"ln closing, my family and I send
our prayers out to my father.

01:59:32.676 --> 01:59:34.517
"May God bless him.

01:59:34.596 --> 01:59:37.476
Yours, truly,
Jesus Shuttlesworth."

01:59:39.075 --> 01:59:41.796
"Jake Shuttlesworth...

01:59:41.877 --> 01:59:43.877
- "a... convict--
- Convicted.

01:59:43.957 --> 01:59:47.316
- convicted mur... der..."
- Murderer.

01:59:47.397 --> 01:59:50.077
Gimme the paper, man.
You're irking me with that shit.

01:59:50.118 --> 01:59:52.516
About to graduate,
you can't even read, dumb ass.

01:59:52.556 --> 01:59:54.676
Can too read. Miss Janus says
I got problems readin' out loud.

01:59:54.756 --> 01:59:57.477
- He's just nervous.
- Man, fuck that, Sip. Finish readin'.

01:59:57.558 --> 02:00:00.358
Gladly.

02:00:00.438 --> 02:00:04.036
"The father of the number-one basketball
prospect Jesus Shuttlesworth...

02:00:04.117 --> 02:00:07.716
"was captured last night in the Coney
lsland section of Brooklyn, New York...

02:00:07.797 --> 02:00:09.757
- "after a week-long manhunt.
- What?

02:00:09.836 --> 02:00:13.117
"He had escaped the maximum security
Attica State Penitentiary...

02:00:13.198 --> 02:00:15.038
"seven days before.

02:00:15.119 --> 02:00:16.958
No official word yet
on how he escaped."

02:00:17.038 --> 02:00:20.117
How could Uncle Jake have escaped when
they let him walk out the front gate?

02:00:20.198 --> 02:00:22.918
There's gotta be some truth
to it if it's in the papers.

02:00:22.998 --> 02:00:24.837
Oh, come on, man!

02:00:27.559 --> 02:00:29.438
Yo, Shuttlesworth.

02:00:31.798 --> 02:00:34.477
Warden wants to see you now.

02:00:34.558 --> 02:00:36.878
He say what this is about?

02:00:40.879 --> 02:00:43.719
Things didn't work out
exactly as we planned,

02:00:43.798 --> 02:00:45.639
but the governor got
what he wanted.

02:00:45.719 --> 02:00:49.079
I'm happy for him.
Why do you think my son did it?

02:00:49.158 --> 02:00:52.318
I haven't had the pleasure of meeting
your son as yet. I can't speculate.

02:00:52.399 --> 02:00:54.919
- Maybe someday you'll get
to ask him that in person.
- Someday.

02:00:54.998 --> 02:00:56.839
And when will that be,
Warden?

02:00:56.919 --> 02:00:59.240
The governor
has yet to inform me.

02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:02.598
For your information,
technically...

02:01:02.679 --> 02:01:06.120
you did not get your son
to sign the letter of intent.

02:01:06.199 --> 02:01:08.999
Hopefully that's not gonna
make a difference.

02:01:09.079 --> 02:01:11.959
- We need some time.
- Well, I got that, huh?

02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:17.480
Dear Jesus, ever since you was born
I been pushin' you,

02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:23.521
tryin' to make you the best ball player
that you could possibly be,

02:01:23.599 --> 02:01:26.241
tryin' to make you the ball player
that I never was.

02:01:27.241 --> 02:01:29.000
I finally came
to the realization...

02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:32.361
that I was pushin' you
further and further away from me also.

02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.281
I believe that things
gon' work out for the best for you,

02:01:38.361 --> 02:01:40.041
- Jesus was a name.
- for Mary.

02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:41.761
You got the game.

02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:43.801
Sip, sip, sip on this.

02:01:43.881 --> 02:01:46.681
Your great-grandfather always used to
tell me that you keep tryin' on shoes,

02:01:46.761 --> 02:01:49.121
sooner or later you gon'
find a pair that fit you.

02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:50.721
The... farmhouse...

02:01:50.801 --> 02:01:53.601
Well, I'm here to testify
that I found a pair.

02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:55.840
House. O-U-sss...

02:01:55.921 --> 02:01:57.762
They hurt like hell, son.

02:01:59.921 --> 02:02:02.402
- I love you.
- "l love you, son."

02:02:02.441 --> 02:02:06.041
Your father,
Jake Shuttlesworth.

02:02:48.844 --> 02:02:54.282
Five, four, three, two, one.

02:02:55.324 --> 02:02:57.244
And the crowd goes wild.

02:03:01.963 --> 02:03:03.644
Uh-oh. He's heatin' up.

02:03:03.723 --> 02:03:06.924
You can't stop him.
You can only hope to contain him.

02:03:18.004 --> 02:03:19.844
Jake, stop!

02:03:19.924 --> 02:03:23.204
Stop right there!

02:03:23.245 --> 02:03:27.205
Turn around!
Do it now, or you're a dead man!

02:03:40.924 --> 02:03:43.406
Turn around and back up!

02:05:32.689 --> 02:05:34.889
Yeah, that's right,
this cut goes out to all y'all...

02:05:34.930 --> 02:05:36.529
that's been missin' us for mad years.

02:05:36.609 --> 02:05:39.688
One love, yo. Hey, that's right.
He's got game.

02:05:39.729 --> 02:05:41.410
P.E., 1998.

02:05:41.488 --> 02:05:44.451
If man is the father
the son is the center of the earth

02:05:44.530 --> 02:05:46.050
In the middle
of the universe

02:05:46.130 --> 02:05:48.810
Then why is this verse
comin' six times rehearsed

02:05:48.850 --> 02:05:51.531
Don't freestyle much
but I write 'em like such

02:05:51.571 --> 02:05:53.810
Amongst the themes
controlled by the screens

02:05:53.890 --> 02:05:56.370
What does it all mean
All this shit I'm seein'

02:05:56.450 --> 02:05:58.651
Human bein's
screamin' vocal javelins

02:05:58.731 --> 02:06:00.492
Sign of a local nigga
unravelin'

02:06:00.571 --> 02:06:03.611
- Uh-huh
- My wanderin' got my ass wonderin'

02:06:03.691 --> 02:06:05.971
Where Christ is
in all this crisis

02:06:06.050 --> 02:06:08.290
Hatin' Satan
never knew what nice is

02:06:08.370 --> 02:06:10.810
Check the papers
Well, I bet on ices

02:06:10.891 --> 02:06:13.092
More than your eyes can see
and ears can hear

02:06:13.170 --> 02:06:15.531
Year by year
all the sense disappears

02:06:15.611 --> 02:06:17.731
Nonsense perseveres
Prayers laced with fear

02:06:17.811 --> 02:06:20.330
- Beware Two-triple 0 is near
- It might feel good

02:06:20.410 --> 02:06:21.891
It might sound
a little somethin'

02:06:21.971 --> 02:06:24.291
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothin'

02:06:24.331 --> 02:06:27.332
What is game, who got game
Where's the game in life

02:06:27.412 --> 02:06:28.972
Behind
the game behind the game

02:06:29.052 --> 02:06:33.252
I got game, she got game, we got game
they got game, he got game

02:06:33.331 --> 02:06:35.932
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'

02:06:36.012 --> 02:06:39.211
- But fuck the game
if it ain't sayin' nothin'
- Damn

02:06:39.292 --> 02:06:40.772
Was it somethin' I said

02:06:40.852 --> 02:06:43.293
Pretend you don't see
so you turn your head

02:06:43.372 --> 02:06:45.453
Race scared of his shadow
Does it matter

02:06:45.532 --> 02:06:48.932
The thought of reparation's got him
playin' with the population

02:06:49.012 --> 02:06:50.652
Nothin' to lose
Everything approved

02:06:50.731 --> 02:06:52.732
People use
Even murders excused

02:06:52.812 --> 02:06:54.892
White men in suits
don't have to jump

02:06:54.932 --> 02:06:57.574
Still 1,001 ways
to lose with the shoes

02:06:57.653 --> 02:07:00.173
God takes care
of old folks and fools

02:07:00.253 --> 02:07:02.573
While the devil takes care
of makin' all the rules

02:07:02.613 --> 02:07:04.053
Folks don't even
own themselves

02:07:04.132 --> 02:07:06.413
Payin' mental rent
to corporate presidents

02:07:06.492 --> 02:07:09.132
- My man, my man
- One out of one million residents

02:07:09.213 --> 02:07:11.933
Be a dissident
who ain't kissin' it

02:07:12.012 --> 02:07:14.053
The politics
of chains and whips

02:07:14.094 --> 02:07:16.413
Got the six missing chips
and all the championships

02:07:16.494 --> 02:07:18.734
What's love got to do
with what you got

02:07:18.774 --> 02:07:21.213
Don't let a win get to your head
or a loss to your heart

02:07:21.294 --> 02:07:23.454
- Word
- Nonsense perseveres
Prayers laced with fear

02:07:23.533 --> 02:07:25.773
Beware
Two-triple 0 is near

02:07:25.853 --> 02:07:28.294
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:30.093
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothin'

02:07:30.174 --> 02:07:32.894
What is game, who got game
Where's the game in life

02:07:32.973 --> 02:07:35.214
Behind
the game behind the game

02:07:35.255 --> 02:07:39.413
I got game, she got game, we got game
they got game, he got game

02:07:39.494 --> 02:07:42.014
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'

02:07:42.093 --> 02:07:45.214
But fuck the game
if it ain't sayin' nothin'

02:07:45.295 --> 02:07:46.734
Yeah, that's right.
Everybody got game.

02:07:46.815 --> 02:07:50.535
But we just here to let you all know
that P.E. is in full effect...

02:07:50.574 --> 02:07:52.775
from right now
till the year 2000.

02:07:52.854 --> 02:07:54.455
Hey, yo, my man, sing it.

02:07:54.535 --> 02:07:56.655
There's something happening here

02:07:56.734 --> 02:07:59.256
- Yeah, yeah.
- What it is

02:07:59.335 --> 02:08:01.415
Ain't exactly clear

02:08:02.616 --> 02:08:04.295
There's a man

02:08:04.375 --> 02:08:07.135
- With a gun over there
- Yeah, that's right. Ha-ha!

02:08:07.214 --> 02:08:11.975
Tellin' me
I got to beware

02:08:12.055 --> 02:08:15.496
It's time we stopped, children
What's that sound

02:08:15.536 --> 02:08:18.815
Everybody look
what's goin' down

02:08:18.896 --> 02:08:21.376
Hey, yo, I don't think
they heard you, Stephen.
Kick it to 'em again one more time.

02:08:21.455 --> 02:08:24.615
It's time we stopped, children
What's that sound

02:08:24.695 --> 02:08:28.936
Everybody look
what's goin' down

02:08:31.415 --> 02:08:33.817
Thought of that millennium
just be killin' 'em

02:08:33.897 --> 02:08:37.137
And that's scary
Like lies buried in a library

02:08:37.216 --> 02:08:38.536
I ain't even gotta ask it

02:08:38.576 --> 02:08:41.696
And who's underpaid that
got fouled at the basket

02:08:41.777 --> 02:08:44.418
I can't blame the M.V. who be
gettin' all the Benjies

02:08:44.497 --> 02:08:46.257
And takin' them grants
for granted

02:08:46.338 --> 02:08:49.217
Last I checked pyramids
wasn't built like projects

02:08:49.297 --> 02:08:51.056
Or on them
government checks, uhh

02:08:51.096 --> 02:08:53.177
Modern-day thugs
ain't got no guts

02:08:53.256 --> 02:08:55.576
Pardon the expression
And the governor nuts

02:08:55.657 --> 02:08:57.777
Last time in a church
be the last time in a church

02:08:57.818 --> 02:09:00.698
Dead pledge allegiance
to CDs and movies

02:09:00.777 --> 02:09:03.057
Leavin' reality
Believe in fantasy

02:09:03.096 --> 02:09:05.457
Bleedin' fatalities
Too many formalities

02:09:05.498 --> 02:09:06.737
Prayers laced with fear
Beware

02:09:06.778 --> 02:09:09.137
Two-triple 0 is here

02:09:09.218 --> 02:09:11.818
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'

02:09:11.898 --> 02:09:14.258
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothin'

02:09:14.298 --> 02:09:17.579
What is game, who got game
Where is the game in life

02:09:17.658 --> 02:09:19.218
Behind
the game behind the game

02:09:19.259 --> 02:09:23.378
I got game, she got game, we got game
they got game, he got game

02:09:23.458 --> 02:09:25.418
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'

02:09:25.498 --> 02:09:28.778
But fuck the game
if it ain't sayin' nothin'

02:09:28.859 --> 02:09:33.339
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

02:09:33.418 --> 02:09:35.058
- I got game, she got game
- Everybody knows

02:09:35.139 --> 02:09:37.459
- We got game, they got game
he got game
- What's going down

02:09:37.499 --> 02:09:42.178
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

02:09:42.258 --> 02:09:44.500
- I got game, she got game
- Everybody knows

02:09:44.539 --> 02:09:46.899
- We got game, they got game
he got game
- What's going down

02:09:46.939 --> 02:09:51.659
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

02:09:51.698 --> 02:09:53.820
- I got game, she got game

02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:56.139
- We got game, they got game
he got game
- What's going down

02:09:56.218 --> 02:10:01.340
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:03.219
- I got game, she got game

02:10:03.298 --> 02:10:06.259

he got game
- What's going down

02:10:06.339 --> 02:10:10.939
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

02:10:11.019 --> 02:10:15.700
Everybody knows
what's going down

02:10:15.741 --> 02:10:20.420
Ahh, ohh
What's that sound

02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:25.060
Everybody knows
what's going down

02:10:26.305 --> 02:10:32.810
