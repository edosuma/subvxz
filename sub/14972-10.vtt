<i> Previously on van Helsing.</i>

00:03.537 --> 00:05.037
What the hell was that?

00:05.039 --> 00:07.473
It's other people, people we can
make contact with.

00:07.475 --> 00:08.507
Who's there?

00:08.508 --> 00:09.540
Where do you even live?

00:09.543 --> 00:10.376
You want to see?

00:11.545 --> 00:12.778
Jesus Christ, Sam.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.980
I think we just
got our lives back.

00:14.982 --> 00:15.881
We got company.

00:15.883 --> 00:18.050
( Gunfire )

00:19.387 --> 00:21.787
I'm going to help doc look
for this gorman idiot again.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.389
( Fighting grunts )

00:23.391 --> 00:29.495
( Gasps )

00:29.497 --> 00:30.162
( Sobbing )

00:30.164 --> 00:31.330
Open the door!!

00:31.332 --> 00:32.331
( Sobbing )
I'm sorry!

00:32.333 --> 00:33.699

( Crows cawing )

00:51.318 --> 00:56.655

00:59.593 --> 01:01.193
Hey, nap time's over.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.162
( Gasps )

01:03.164 --> 01:04.329
We gotta go.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.903
We gotta move.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.444
( Hissing )

01:18.446 --> 01:20.679
Oh, shit!

01:20.681 --> 01:21.780
Here we go!

01:21.782 --> 01:22.514
Back to back!

01:22.515 --> 01:23.247
Alright, I got this.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.016
( Gun shots )

01:24.017 --> 01:24.783
Don't give them an easy target!

01:24.785 --> 01:28.353
( Gun fire )

01:28.355 --> 01:29.621
I'm down to my last clip!

01:29.623 --> 01:31.290
Me too!

01:31.292 --> 01:32.091
We fight or die.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.692
Okay.

01:34.862 --> 01:47.439
( Gun fire continues )

01:49.043 --> 01:51.110

( Screaming )

02:02.389 --> 02:04.523
( Snarling and growling )

02:18.973 --> 02:22.574
Bad spot for a camp-out.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.543
Couldn't find a motel.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.581
More ferals will come.

02:29.583 --> 02:30.816
Time to go.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.084
Go where?

02:32.086 --> 02:33.952
Eden.

02:39.660 --> 02:45.564
<i> ( Crows cawing )</i>

02:50.604 --> 02:53.839
Food, medicine...
You'll be safe.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.507
Oh yeah, heard
that one before.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.914
What, you trust him?

03:01.916 --> 03:04.416
Don't you?

03:04.418 --> 03:05.584
Everyone we meet
lets us down.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.019
John, gorman...

03:07.021 --> 03:08.654
Why should this one
be any different?

03:11.525 --> 03:12.491
Psychotherapy?

03:12.493 --> 03:13.759
Oh, hell no.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.662
Whatever it was,
it's home now.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.597
It's like a dream.

03:20.034 --> 03:23.101
Thank god, you're safe.

03:23.103 --> 03:26.505
Welcome to eden.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.006
My name is mica.

03:28.008 --> 03:31.443
Thanks.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.278
Is this place real?

03:33.280 --> 03:35.881
We are lucky to have found you
in the woods.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.218
Beth, water.

03:39.220 --> 03:43.339
For our guests.

03:43.340 --> 03:47.459
What were you doing out there
in the woods?

03:47.461 --> 03:50.729
We were heading south.

03:50.731 --> 03:54.199
Kept running into one
bad situation after another.

03:54.201 --> 03:55.968
Best you move on then.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.236
Don't want your troubles
at our door.

03:57.238 --> 03:58.136
Beth.

03:59.039 --> 04:04.042
( Bells toll )

04:04.044 --> 04:04.977
See what they've done?

04:04.979 --> 04:07.145
Emma.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.548
Take our visitors inside,
please.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.983
And Peggy, quickly now,
quickly.

04:10.985 --> 04:11.316
Follow me.

04:11.318 --> 04:13.318
Please.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.288
See? No safe place.

04:16.290 --> 04:20.892
( Bell continues to toll )

04:20.894 --> 04:23.462
Go upstairs and hide.

04:33.140 --> 04:36.008
Magdalene.

04:36.010 --> 04:39.745
You're three days early.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.747
A problem?

04:41.749 --> 04:44.667
No.

04:44.668 --> 04:47.586
No, we can give you
half right now.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.255
Xavier?

04:50.257 --> 04:51.990
Please.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.162
I passed dead ferals
in the woods.

04:57.164 --> 05:00.265
Hunting them for sport now?

05:00.267 --> 05:02.234
If we don't, they hunt us.

05:05.506 --> 05:09.574
( Sniffs )

05:11.245 --> 05:13.178
Something wrong?

05:13.180 --> 05:16.014
I'm told there are humans.

05:16.016 --> 05:16.848
From the city.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.952
Fugitives.

05:20.954 --> 05:24.856
One of them is special.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.359
A woman.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.433
You will tell me
what you know.

05:45.879 --> 05:51.216
I know nothing.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.285
Is that so?

05:53.287 --> 05:55.554
Magda.

05:55.556 --> 05:59.725
After all this time.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.761
Why would I lie now?

06:15.743 --> 06:17.776
Mmmm.

06:28.055 --> 06:28.987
Find this woman.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.923
Inform me.

06:31.925 --> 06:39.331
Tell me, what does Julius want
with this woman?

06:39.333 --> 06:43.001
I honour our deal, mica.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.103
Question me?

06:45.105 --> 06:46.938
Defy me?

06:46.940 --> 06:50.909
And all this ends.

06:59.987 --> 07:04.322
So... you cut a deal
with one of them?

07:04.324 --> 07:05.757
Well, it just makes sense.

07:05.759 --> 07:10.095
Instead of being murdered
or enslaved,

07:10.097 --> 07:13.999
I've found a way
for us to co-exist.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.167
A deal with the devil.

07:15.169 --> 07:16.601
It's an accord.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.403
It's an accord.

07:18.405 --> 07:24.242
Twice a month we supply
magdalene with fresh blood

07:24.244 --> 07:31.116
and she ensures that her kind
will leave us in peace.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.350
And you trust her?

07:32.352 --> 07:34.252
I have no reason not to.

07:38.192 --> 07:40.091
It's hard to believe.

07:40.093 --> 07:43.528
Yes. I prefer to think of it
as an elegant solution

07:43.530 --> 07:45.964
to a terrible problem.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.767
You must be the woman
Julius is seeking.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.269
I don't know anything
about that.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.271
I'm searching
for my daughter.

07:56.777 --> 08:02.013
We killed a lot of
Julius's vampires.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.682
I'm guessing
he wants revenge.

08:08.355 --> 08:11.556
Magdalene said
you were special.

08:11.558 --> 08:13.892
Just lucky.

08:13.894 --> 08:19.364
I'm still alive and a bunch
of our people aren't.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.908
This place feels too good
to be true.

08:29.910 --> 08:33.378
I was a skeptic at first,
but inside these walls

08:33.380 --> 08:34.713
we're free from the horrors
out there.

08:34.715 --> 08:38.149
Or just hiding from reality.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.385
I had a friend
who felt like you.

08:40.387 --> 08:43.889
Walls and barricades
meant safety, but...

08:43.891 --> 08:46.992
Eventually the real world
comes crashing in.

08:46.994 --> 08:47.826
If there's a better alternative,

08:47.828 --> 08:49.928
I've never found it.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.496
I know what it's like
to run.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.165
Scared.

08:54.167 --> 08:58.303
But then I found
this place.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.972
So you follow mica now?

09:00.974 --> 09:03.575
Like I found religion
or something?

09:03.577 --> 09:05.744
It's not like that.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.846
Then what?

09:07.848 --> 09:09.347
I'd tell you if you
were staying,

09:09.349 --> 09:16.488
but it sounds like you're
moving on, so...

09:16.490 --> 09:17.589
Women's dorms are this way.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.592
I'll take it from here,
Zorro.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.160
Thanks.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.344
( Locks door )

11:19.946 --> 11:20.745
( Cries out )

11:23.617 --> 11:26.351
Curiosity killed the cat.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.901
So, today the day
we move on?

11:42.903 --> 11:44.569
What's up, sue?

11:44.571 --> 11:46.304
It's not me, it's this place.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.140
I barely slept last night.

11:49.142 --> 11:52.310
I actually dreamt.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.812
The first time in forever.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.154
Seriously?

12:03.156 --> 12:05.223
Blood pact
with the vampires?

12:05.225 --> 12:06.958
Bare-chested swordsman?

12:06.960 --> 12:09.894
It's like cuckoo's nest
meets Camelot.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.853
It's weird.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.488
What?

12:36.490 --> 12:39.758
All these pregnant bellies
and yet there's no kids.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.260
Doesn't that strike you
as odd?

12:44.164 --> 12:51.770
( Screaming in pain )

12:51.772 --> 12:52.537
I can't stop the bleeding.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.104
What's happening?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.539
She's hemorrhaging.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.840
You're gonna need
to do a c-section.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.109
You're the doctor.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.677
( Stuttering )
I-i...

12:59.679 --> 13:00.678
I have a surgical kit.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.180
Slow down.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.270
I'm not a surgeon.

13:03.271 --> 13:04.359
Listen to me.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.448
If you don't cut into her,
the baby dies.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.584
Maybe both of them.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.153
( Cries out in pain )

13:18.799 --> 13:19.731
Vanessa, keep on talking to her.

13:19.733 --> 13:20.866
Ok.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.000
Ok, Peggy, Peggy, listen.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.301
It's all gonna work out, ok?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.636
It's gonna be ok.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.071
You can do this.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.073
No, I just wanna go.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.476
You can't.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.412
Ok? Just breathe.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.247
You don't know...
The pain.

13:36.249 --> 13:40.084
I do, honey,
i promise you I do.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.353
Beth, pull up on the abdominal
wall more.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.756
Like that.

13:44.758 --> 13:45.824
Rupturing the membrane.

13:48.662 --> 13:49.694
Ok, here we go.

13:49.695 --> 13:50.727
Here we go.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.096
Take a deep breath.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.898
Take a deep breath.

13:53.900 --> 14:03.842
( Groaning )

14:03.844 --> 14:05.243
Here we go.

14:05.245 --> 14:08.513
( Groaning )

14:08.515 --> 14:10.181
Here it comes.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.784
Ok.

14:12.786 --> 14:13.952
Baby's out!

14:13.954 --> 14:15.353
Baby's out.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.421
Give it to me.

14:16.423 --> 14:21.292
( Baby cries )

14:21.294 --> 14:23.027
I'm cutting the cord.

14:23.029 --> 14:23.795
( Baby cries )

14:23.797 --> 14:26.431
You did it.

14:26.433 --> 14:30.201
( Baby cries )

14:30.203 --> 14:32.704
Ok. Ok.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.139
How is the baby?

14:35.141 --> 14:37.375
Shhh.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.616
It's a girl.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.904
Is everything alright?

15:05.906 --> 15:08.072
Yeah.

15:08.074 --> 15:12.410
Look, mica, there are
no children here.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.913
What's gonna happen
to that baby?

15:14.915 --> 15:19.150
The families will be reunited
when the time is right.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.085
The pregnant women
who come here,

15:21.087 --> 15:23.087
they are the daughters
of the resistance.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.088
They are the wives and
the partners of patriots

15:25.091 --> 15:30.995
still fighting the vampires and
for them this is a safe haven.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.665
So Peggy and the others
didn't get knocked up by you.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.940
This is not a cult.

15:41.942 --> 15:45.743
We are doing our part to give
the human race a future.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.513
To give them a new generation
of freedom fighters

15:48.515 --> 15:53.184
because they might be the
ones to end this nightmare.

15:53.186 --> 15:53.651
Magdalene doesn't know.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.521
No.

15:56.523 --> 16:00.491
So you can see how important
all of this is.

16:00.493 --> 16:04.996
Our motives are pure.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.950
Hey.

16:31.725 --> 16:35.526
You did good.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.863
You saved a life.

16:38.865 --> 16:43.368
Axel would have been proud.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.536
No he wouldn't.

16:49.109 --> 16:52.877
Doc, what happened
down there?

16:52.879 --> 16:54.979
( Sighs )

16:54.981 --> 16:57.382
I waited,

16:57.384 --> 17:00.985
and then when it was clear
he couldn't make it I left.

17:00.987 --> 17:04.322
That's all.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.290
What do you mean
"couldn't make it"?

17:09.996 --> 17:11.229
It was gorman.

17:11.231 --> 17:11.896
He turned.

17:11.897 --> 17:12.562
He had a hold of Axel.

17:12.565 --> 17:16.667
I had to let go.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.070
I was scared!

17:19.072 --> 17:21.239
Vanessa, what do you expect me
to do?

17:21.241 --> 17:22.874
Get bitten as well?

17:28.681 --> 17:34.919
You shut the door on him
didn't you?

17:34.921 --> 17:43.261
You shut the door,
and you left him to die.

17:43.263 --> 17:48.199
He kept you alive.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.902
He- he fed you with
his own blood for months.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.670
Vanessa, please.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.006
You don't understand.

18:08.455 --> 18:12.256
Vanessa, I did
what I had to do!

18:16.296 --> 18:18.463
We're leaving in the morning.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.199
You can stay here or go
wherever you want.

18:21.201 --> 18:25.303
I don't care.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.605
This is where we say goodbye.

18:33.213 --> 18:40.218
( Sobbing )

19:01.307 --> 19:05.476
How long have I...
Been like this?

19:05.478 --> 19:08.479
The fever came on after you ate
that bad mushroom.

19:08.481 --> 19:12.917
It's breaking now.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.819
Here.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.053
Drink.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.765
I have to go...
Something important-

19:27.767 --> 19:33.104
no. You rest until the doctor
can see you.

19:33.106 --> 19:34.338
The doctor?

19:34.340 --> 19:36.340
What doctor?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.509
She's new.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.178
Birthed a baby today.

19:40.180 --> 19:44.615
It was incredible.

19:44.617 --> 19:48.686
But I... have to find
my sister.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.455
Sleep.

19:51.457 --> 19:55.693
I'll look after you.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.595
There's nowhere you need
to go.

20:13.813 --> 20:21.219
The only way forward is
to let go of the pain.

20:21.221 --> 20:21.986
I don't know how.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.889
I will show you.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.558
Yes.

20:27.560 --> 20:35.800
So, first place your hands
on the table.

20:45.178 --> 20:47.645
Good.

20:47.647 --> 20:52.717
Now close your eyes.

20:52.719 --> 20:58.089
Close your eyes.

20:58.091 --> 21:02.426
And breathe.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.229
( Exhales )

21:05.231 --> 21:08.099
Just breathe.

21:08.101 --> 21:16.774
And... let your thoughts
take you back to that time.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.745
To that place.

21:20.747 --> 21:23.748
When your pain began.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.222
Katana.

21:31.224 --> 21:34.058
Choice of the Japanese samurais
for centuries.

21:34.060 --> 21:37.561
Yeah that, or guys with mullets
and corvettes.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.230
The good old days.

21:39.232 --> 21:40.798
Let's see what you got.

21:52.745 --> 21:56.647
Impressive.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.083
Did you learn all this
since the rising?

21:59.085 --> 22:00.818
I was a high school
phys. Ed. Teacher.

22:00.820 --> 22:01.819
Yep.

22:01.821 --> 22:02.653
( Laughs )

22:02.655 --> 22:05.323
Taught fencing at the y.

22:05.325 --> 22:08.259
Never thought it'd actually have
any practical value.

22:08.261 --> 22:09.727
What about you?

22:09.729 --> 22:17.501
Uh... I never really found
my calling.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.670
What about family?

22:19.672 --> 22:22.340
A partner?

22:22.342 --> 22:24.008
I had a girlfriend.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.178
She left for work the morning
of the rising.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.246
The last time I ever saw her.

22:29.248 --> 22:34.118
Tried her cell for days until
the whole system shut down.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.687
Didn't get a chance to say
goodbye, you know?

22:40.793 --> 22:44.595
Never let your emotions
drop your guard.

22:44.597 --> 22:47.164
Never underestimate
your opponent.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.438
( Laughs )

24:22.428 --> 24:24.328
What did you do to him?

24:24.330 --> 24:28.766
Oh, I... I simply showed him
a path.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.100
Nothing more.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.536
He's the one who took
the steps.

24:32.538 --> 24:33.871
That sounds like a lot of
new age

24:33.873 --> 24:38.275
psychobabble bullshit to me.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.110
What are you so afraid of?

24:40.112 --> 24:40.778
Don't bother.

24:40.780 --> 24:41.445
I'm not buying.

24:41.447 --> 24:42.346
So angry all the time.

24:42.348 --> 24:44.415
Angry, angry, angry.

24:44.417 --> 24:46.617
You don't know the first thing
about me.

24:46.619 --> 24:49.253
I know what you were.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.255
Flesh told me.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.122
Told me everything.

24:52.124 --> 24:58.195
His past, Susan's, yours.

24:58.197 --> 25:02.132
And then there's Vanessa.

25:02.134 --> 25:09.440
With all of her...
Abilities.

25:09.442 --> 25:15.479
Certainly I can see
why she's being hunted.

25:15.481 --> 25:20.618
What are you gonna do
with that?

25:20.620 --> 25:22.953
There can be a place
for you here.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.055
All of you.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.024
I'm a friend.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.992
Yeah, well, I don't need
a friend.

25:28.995 --> 25:32.396
And you sure as hell can't wash
away my sins so we're done.

25:32.398 --> 25:37.167
Well, in the end
it's your choice.

25:37.169 --> 25:41.972
You can embrace who you are

25:41.974 --> 25:46.477
or you can hang on to
what you were.

25:46.479 --> 25:48.379
Can't do both.

26:04.263 --> 26:09.233
( Pounding )

26:09.235 --> 26:11.936
( Low grunt )

26:11.938 --> 26:15.906
( Pounding )

26:26.018 --> 26:29.520
It's for my parents.

26:29.522 --> 26:30.521
I'm sorry.

26:30.523 --> 26:35.459
No, it's ok.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.361
I kept them safe
after the rising.

26:37.363 --> 26:40.130
Brought them here.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.198
With all that we went through

26:41.200 --> 26:47.204
I thought the worst
was behind us.

26:47.206 --> 26:52.376
Dad had a heart attack
about six months back.

26:52.378 --> 26:55.613
Nothing anyone could do.

26:55.615 --> 26:58.282
At least he passed quickly,

26:58.284 --> 27:01.452
you know, on his own terms.

27:01.454 --> 27:06.957
Not theirs.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.194
Mom died a month back.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.963
Never got over his loss.

27:17.036 --> 27:25.042
They were all I had left,
and I couldn't save them.

28:13.826 --> 28:18.328
You bit me.

28:18.330 --> 28:21.598
I didn't mean to.

28:21.600 --> 28:26.003
It just kind of happened.

28:26.005 --> 28:29.840
Are you... one of them?

28:29.842 --> 28:30.974
No.

28:36.248 --> 28:39.850
Well, not entirely.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.418
What does that mean?

28:41.420 --> 28:43.721
( Sighs )

28:49.328 --> 29:01.271
I'm... I have... abilities.

29:01.273 --> 29:04.608
Ones I don't fully understand.

29:04.610 --> 29:08.045
Vampires turn human.

29:08.047 --> 29:12.683
Ferals die.

29:12.685 --> 29:19.623
All with a bite.

29:19.625 --> 29:20.791
That's why they're hunting you.

29:20.793 --> 29:25.295
They're afraid of you.

29:25.297 --> 29:29.233
It's a powerful gift.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.301
Or a curse.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.737
Depends.

29:33.739 --> 29:35.739
You could be the difference.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.641
Hope instead of fear.

29:37.643 --> 29:42.579
A better future
for that newborn baby.

29:42.581 --> 29:47.151
That baby.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.920
Where does mica take them,
Theo?

29:49.922 --> 29:53.557
Beth takes them to a rendezvous
point with the resistance.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.092
Where are they based?

29:55.094 --> 29:58.328
Last I heard they set up camp
in Seattle.

29:58.330 --> 30:03.500
Re-took the city
a few months ago.

30:03.502 --> 30:07.171
What?

30:07.173 --> 30:09.306
You heard wrong.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.976
Come on.

30:33.866 --> 30:36.166
Sam?

30:39.038 --> 30:45.209
( Laughing )

30:45.211 --> 30:47.845
How did you find me?!

30:52.551 --> 30:53.634
Sam, no, no!

30:53.635 --> 30:54.718
Let him go, he's not a threat.

30:54.720 --> 30:55.336
He's not a threat.

30:55.337 --> 30:55.953
He's not a threat.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.955
( Struggling )

30:57.957 --> 30:58.622
What're you doing?

30:58.623 --> 30:59.288
Sam!

30:59.291 --> 31:01.291
( Choking )

31:01.293 --> 31:02.192
Let him go.

31:06.465 --> 31:07.364
No.

31:09.902 --> 31:10.634
Sam, please.

31:10.636 --> 31:11.735
Let him go!

31:11.737 --> 31:13.487
Sam!

31:13.488 --> 31:15.238
( Struggling )

31:15.241 --> 31:16.807
Sam, let him go!

31:16.809 --> 31:17.741
Let him go!

31:17.743 --> 31:21.645
( Choking )

31:21.647 --> 31:25.749
Sam, no!

31:25.751 --> 31:26.817
Oh my god!

31:26.819 --> 31:28.452
Sam, don't!

31:43.135 --> 31:45.736
Sam, what have you done?!

31:46.005 --> 31:50.040
Shhh...

31:57.750 --> 31:59.049
Woah.

32:07.826 --> 32:09.159
I'll take her.

32:30.716 --> 32:31.949
Where are you going?

32:31.951 --> 32:32.849
To fetch some water
for the horse.

32:32.851 --> 32:35.352
I'll be right back.

32:37.856 --> 32:40.924
( Horse whinnies )

32:44.697 --> 32:48.432
( Gasps )

32:48.801 --> 32:51.935
Magdalene!! Back off!

32:54.540 --> 32:55.439
Now.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.274
Come closer.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.608
I kill them both.

32:58.610 --> 33:01.144
You kill them both
I'll tear you apart.

33:01.146 --> 33:03.380
These were promised to me.

33:03.382 --> 33:07.317
Mica, our pact.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.552
I didn't know.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.658
Whatever sick deal he made?

33:14.660 --> 33:16.560
It's over.

33:16.562 --> 33:19.496
I go, they live.

33:19.498 --> 33:23.734
Don't let her hurt my baby.

33:23.736 --> 33:26.503
You're the one Julius wants.

33:26.505 --> 33:29.573
What makes you special?

33:29.575 --> 33:31.375
Why don't you come here
and find out?

33:37.149 --> 33:40.317
( Baby cries )

33:40.319 --> 33:42.652
Let her go.

33:42.654 --> 33:43.153
Trust me.

33:43.155 --> 33:44.721
Save the child.

33:44.723 --> 33:46.156
We'll deal with her later.

33:46.158 --> 33:51.094
( Baby cries )

33:51.096 --> 33:52.129
What have you done?!

33:52.130 --> 33:53.163
She'll kill us all!

33:53.165 --> 33:55.665
Start talking.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.906
We gotta go before they discover
what you did.

34:02.908 --> 34:05.242
Ok.

34:13.519 --> 34:17.587
Drop your weapons.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.756
Drop them!

34:25.798 --> 34:27.597
We offered you comfort.

34:27.599 --> 34:30.300
We offered you safety.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.368
This is how you repay us?

34:31.369 --> 34:32.435
Look man, we just
wanna leave.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.838
I cared for you,
mohamad.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.440
How could you do this?

34:36.442 --> 34:37.774
Emma, this is my friend.

34:37.776 --> 34:39.543
You murdered Xavier.

34:39.545 --> 34:42.612
You butchered him.

34:42.614 --> 34:45.115
Take them.

34:45.117 --> 34:49.286
Hey, hey. Easy, easy.

34:49.288 --> 34:53.056
What're you gonna do?

34:53.058 --> 34:59.596
What I should have done
in the very beginning.

35:06.839 --> 35:13.243
What do you think
we should do?

35:13.245 --> 35:15.112
Banish them.

35:15.114 --> 35:16.913
Send them away from here.

35:16.915 --> 35:21.251
Don't be blinded by friendship.

35:21.253 --> 35:26.890
You need to learn to think like
one of us.

35:40.205 --> 35:43.206
It's alright, friend.

35:43.208 --> 35:45.942
A decision has already
been made.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.811
The hell does that mean?

35:47.812 --> 35:49.679
It means you are murderers,
your friends are murderers.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.448
Vanessa has taken Theo away.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.949
Was this your plan all along?

35:52.951 --> 35:53.700
What plan?

35:53.701 --> 35:54.450
We're just trying to survive.

35:54.453 --> 35:57.053
What about you, mica?

35:57.055 --> 35:58.121
Huh?

35:58.123 --> 35:59.956
Is your whole deal survival?

35:59.958 --> 36:04.127
You know, your blood pact
with your wife.

36:04.129 --> 36:07.130
Yeah, Sam told me
what he found.

36:07.132 --> 36:08.965
You know the vampire, magdalene?

36:08.967 --> 36:12.302
She actually used
to work here.

36:12.304 --> 36:15.071
They were married.

36:15.073 --> 36:18.308
Some kind of sick, twisted deal
you got going on.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.743
No, no, no.

36:19.745 --> 36:20.810
I love magdalene.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.746
It's true.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.814
But she turned.

36:24.816 --> 36:27.651
And when she turned she would
have killed all of us

36:27.653 --> 36:31.888
so I did what I had to do
for us.

36:31.890 --> 36:35.392
Mohamad?

36:35.394 --> 36:38.562
What the hell's going on here?

36:38.564 --> 36:39.829
Take her.

36:39.831 --> 36:42.065
They don't follow orders
from you.

36:42.067 --> 36:42.632
Neither do I.

36:42.634 --> 36:45.068
Not anymore.

36:45.070 --> 36:46.836
We know what you've
been doing, mica.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.405
It's done.

36:48.407 --> 36:49.306
They were there.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.740
They saw, they-
they know.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.976
And I put a stop to it.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.077
All of it.

36:54.079 --> 36:55.912
The babies for magdalene?

36:55.914 --> 36:58.632
What are you talking about?

36:58.633 --> 37:01.351
The newborns don't go back
to the resistance.

37:01.353 --> 37:04.521
They're given to magdalene.

37:04.523 --> 37:05.755
For god knows what.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.857
You have no idea
the consequences.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.659
You told us they were safe.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.528
I protected you for nothing.

37:11.530 --> 37:12.862
It was never nothing.

37:12.864 --> 37:15.599
I gave you peace, I gave you
comfort and safety,

37:15.601 --> 37:20.604
all this for a very small price
to pay.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.439
Small price?

37:22.441 --> 37:25.442
Killing children?

37:25.444 --> 37:28.278
You're a fine one to talk,
friend.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.846
This from the man who dreamed of
killing his family

37:29.848 --> 37:31.848
before he turned.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.117
Fantasized about it.

37:34.119 --> 37:36.186
I told you that
in confidence.

37:36.188 --> 37:41.024
Yes, well your friends
should know who you are.

37:41.026 --> 37:47.297
You are a sick bastard.

37:47.299 --> 37:52.202
It's over.

37:52.204 --> 37:54.638
Magdalene will come for you.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.940
And she will kill you all.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.475
Except for you.

37:58.477 --> 38:02.212
You she will trade in to Julius
and life here will go back-

38:02.214 --> 38:03.680
ahh!!!

38:07.986 --> 38:09.686
<i> Mica!</i>

38:12.391 --> 38:14.124
I believed in you.

38:23.568 --> 38:26.536
You're really gonna stay?

38:26.538 --> 38:28.238
I gotta say, I'm surprised.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.874
There was something good
here once.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.575
Mica betrayed it but
i still believe in it.

38:32.577 --> 38:35.145
He warned you,
magdalene's gonna send others.

38:35.147 --> 38:36.379
You're not safe.

38:36.381 --> 38:37.881
I know.

38:37.883 --> 38:40.417
Beth told me where
to find her.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.218
A shed down by the river.

38:42.220 --> 38:45.221
We'll hunt her and destroy her
before she can bring others.

38:52.564 --> 38:55.432
I've still got a target
on my back.

38:55.434 --> 38:59.436
And my daughter's out there,
so...

38:59.438 --> 39:02.839
These people need me now
more than ever.

39:02.841 --> 39:06.843
You'll find your daughter,
and then I'll find you.

39:12.017 --> 39:15.418
No, you keep it.

39:17.456 --> 39:20.590
( Laughs )

39:44.983 --> 39:47.617
I wish I had been wrong.

39:47.619 --> 39:50.220
We gotta find somewhere.

39:50.222 --> 39:52.722
I still know a place,
I'll show you.

40:01.900 --> 40:02.899
Woah, woah, guys,
guys, guys, guys, guys.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.802
Where's doc?

40:25.891 --> 40:27.590
( Gasps )

40:27.592 --> 40:30.493
You came to kill me.

40:30.495 --> 40:31.094
No.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.897
No.

40:33.899 --> 40:35.665
To warn you.

40:35.667 --> 40:39.335
Theo, he's on his way.

40:39.337 --> 40:41.738
They want you dead.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.605
Mica.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.674
Murdered.

40:46.178 --> 40:47.010

( Gasps )

40:51.116 --> 40:55.785
Why are you telling me this?

40:55.787 --> 40:58.855
I used to be one of you.

40:58.857 --> 41:02.625
Vanessa turned me.

41:02.627 --> 41:06.262
But I wanna turn back.

41:14.206 --> 41:17.707
I can help you escape.

41:17.709 --> 41:23.880
But you have
to help me first.

41:23.882 --> 41:28.084
I was never meant
to be human again.

41:29.888 --> 41:36.459
Please.

41:36.461 --> 41:38.962
I beg you.

41:57.649 --> 42:00.483
Nothing's happening.

42:00.485 --> 42:02.318
No.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.059
What's wrong?

42:10.061 --> 42:12.495
What's wrong?

( Shrieks )

42:16.167 --> 42:17.433
No, please!

42:17.435 --> 42:19.736
Stay away from me!

42:19.738 --> 42:20.904
Whatever you were.

42:20.906 --> 42:25.675
Whatever you are,
stay away or die!
