00:37.580 --> 00:43.100
The Taklamakan Desert
in northern China,

00:43.100 --> 00:47.380
a constantly shifting landscape
of sand.

00:50.420 --> 00:53.580
Temperatures that swing from -20

00:53.580 --> 00:57.660
to more than
40 degrees centigrade...

00:59.100 --> 01:04.860
..and, most critically,
almost entirely without rain.

01:12.100 --> 01:15.580
Yet, here on the dunes...

01:21.940 --> 01:24.540
..a Euphrates poplar tree.

01:31.860 --> 01:34.500
And it's not alone.

01:35.780 --> 01:40.140
Some of these trees have lived
here for 1,000 years.

01:43.180 --> 01:48.300
They have exceptionally long roots
with which to collect water,

01:48.300 --> 01:53.500
and what is more, those roots are
connected to neighbouring trees,

01:53.500 --> 01:56.660
so that if one strikes water,

01:56.660 --> 01:58.260
others can share it.

02:00.780 --> 02:03.460
In every desert across the planet,

02:03.460 --> 02:08.020
plants have found ways
to not only survive,

02:08.020 --> 02:09.900
but flourish.

02:25.100 --> 02:30.580
This is the Gran Desierto
of Mexico and the United States.

02:42.020 --> 02:46.700
These dunes may appear
to be totally barren.

02:46.700 --> 02:50.100
In fact, they are full of life.

02:50.100 --> 02:53.100
In the sand beneath my feet

02:53.100 --> 02:56.260
there are seeds
of many different kinds.

02:56.260 --> 03:00.740
In fact, you could say that the dune
itself is one great seed bank,

03:00.740 --> 03:04.740
and when it rains,
it bursts into life.

03:10.780 --> 03:15.700
But rain may come only once
a decade, and even then,

03:15.700 --> 03:19.740
the long-awaited storm
may be very brief.

03:23.300 --> 03:26.940
So seeds must respond immediately.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.300
This is sand verbena.

03:42.300 --> 03:46.740
It can grow from a seed to a
sweetly-scented flowering plant

03:46.740 --> 03:48.580
in just a few weeks.

03:55.780 --> 04:00.140
Primroses and many other plants
soon join the race

04:00.140 --> 04:02.860
to flower before the sand dries.

04:06.780 --> 04:10.780
Desert blooms like this,
however, are rare.

04:14.180 --> 04:18.300
This is the first year for 20 years.

04:22.540 --> 04:25.100
The combination of vibrant colour

04:25.100 --> 04:29.180
and powerful scent
attracts migrating pollinators,

04:29.180 --> 04:32.340
such as these
Painted Lady butterflies,

04:32.340 --> 04:37.900
which fly into the middle of what
were, only recently, barren dunes.

04:39.740 --> 04:42.660
Everything is rushing
to complete their lives

04:42.660 --> 04:44.780
before the moisture has gone.

04:53.220 --> 04:58.660
Such spectacular blooms transform
deserts all around the world.

05:08.780 --> 05:11.620
From the Atacama in South America...

05:13.340 --> 05:16.940
..to the dusty plains
of southern Africa.

05:35.980 --> 05:40.020
Rain in deserts, however,
never lasts long,

05:40.020 --> 05:43.700
and all too soon,
the flowers wither and die.

05:49.460 --> 05:52.980
But not before they've produced
the next generation...

05:58.220 --> 06:02.820
..the seeds that will now wait
in the sand for the next rains.

06:08.380 --> 06:11.300
In the Sonoran Desert
of North America,

06:11.300 --> 06:15.500
the huge saguaro cacti
have a different strategy.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.660
They store water in quantity

06:18.660 --> 06:21.140
and can live to a great age.

06:22.460 --> 06:24.820
But in their early years,

06:24.820 --> 06:27.180
they are extremely vulnerable.

06:31.100 --> 06:35.380
This little saguaro cactus
is about ten-years-old.

06:35.380 --> 06:40.100
When they're really small and
growing out in the open,

06:40.100 --> 06:43.900
there's a real chance that they may
shrivel up and die.

06:43.900 --> 06:46.220
But this one has been lucky.

06:46.220 --> 06:50.820
It's been growing in the shade
of this mesquite tree,

06:50.820 --> 06:54.980
and it's got a very good chance
of surviving to maturity.

06:56.260 --> 07:01.580
The young saguaro is protected
by the mesquite's branches.

07:01.580 --> 07:05.460
They halve the amount of scorching
sunlight reaching the cactus...

07:07.380 --> 07:09.220
..and so, keep it cool.

07:11.580 --> 07:15.620
And the mesquite's extremely
long roots draw up water,

07:15.620 --> 07:19.100
bringing it within reach
of the young saguaro.

07:23.460 --> 07:27.140
So the mesquite
is known as a 'nurse plant',

07:27.140 --> 07:29.540
and a very effective one it is, too.

07:31.300 --> 07:35.300
In fact, this particular mesquite
has already nurtured

07:35.300 --> 07:38.980
seven young saguaros
over the past 30 years.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.660
As a young cactus grows,

07:45.660 --> 07:50.700
it needs the protection of its nurse
plant, not only from the heat,

07:50.700 --> 07:53.980
but from the other hazards
of desert life.

07:56.860 --> 08:00.660
Temperatures can drop
to -10 degrees overnight...

08:03.620 --> 08:06.820
..and very occasionally...

08:06.820 --> 08:08.740
..it even snows.

08:14.940 --> 08:19.340
If the water stored inside a young
cactus should freeze,

08:19.340 --> 08:21.620
the cactus will die.

08:23.460 --> 08:27.940
But the nurse plant traps a blanket
of slightly warmer air around it,

08:27.940 --> 08:30.980
just enough to keep it alive.

08:33.540 --> 08:37.420
Eventually, saguaros outgrow
their nurses,

08:37.420 --> 08:39.020
but by that time,

08:39.020 --> 08:42.700
they are robust enough to face
the elements by themselves.

08:46.380 --> 08:49.140
No matter how old a desert plant
is,

08:49.140 --> 08:52.300
water is always precious,

08:52.300 --> 08:54.620
whether gathered
from melting snow...

08:59.180 --> 09:01.260
..or a shower of rain.

09:06.580 --> 09:10.260
So, cacti have developed
extraordinary adaptations

09:10.260 --> 09:13.020
that enable them
to not only collect water...

09:14.540 --> 09:16.660
..but to retain it.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.380
Instead of leaves,

09:21.380 --> 09:24.900
which would lose precious
moisture through evaporation,

09:24.900 --> 09:26.780
they have spines.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.260
Each spine
has a tiny pad at its base

09:31.260 --> 09:33.540
where the water is absorbed...

09:35.020 --> 09:38.980
..and then stored
in the great swollen trunk.

09:41.900 --> 09:47.580
A large saguaro can
hold 5,000 litres of water

09:47.580 --> 09:52.620
and is able to do so because it
has another special adaptation.

10:01.580 --> 10:06.340
The ridges on its surface
are like the pleats on an accordion.

10:06.340 --> 10:09.140
They allow the saguaro
to change its shape.

10:10.900 --> 10:14.220
After rain has fallen,
the pleats expand

10:14.220 --> 10:17.700
and the saguaro fills
up its water tank.

10:22.300 --> 10:26.100
In the dry times,
it uses its water to grow,

10:26.100 --> 10:30.900
produce flowers and,
eventually, seeds.

10:33.740 --> 10:37.060
Fully-loaded with thousands
of litres of water,

10:37.060 --> 10:41.380
this saguaro won't need to drink
a single drop for another year.

10:43.860 --> 10:47.540
But such valuable stores
of water attract thieves.

10:49.820 --> 10:52.980
Now the spine's function
changes from collecting...

10:54.660 --> 10:56.020
..to guarding.

10:58.380 --> 11:03.100
The spines of some species
are a quarter of a metre long.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.420
Others are needle-like barbs

11:11.420 --> 11:15.900
that grow in clusters and easily
break off in the skin of any animal

11:15.900 --> 11:17.700
that touches them.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.340
But perhaps the most vicious cacti

11:21.340 --> 11:24.660
belong to a group
called the chollas.

11:25.780 --> 11:29.540
This is called a teddy-bear cholla

11:29.540 --> 11:33.340
because of the thick coating
of spines on it.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.940
But don't be deceived by the name,

11:35.940 --> 11:39.780
there is nothing cuddly
about THIS particular teddy bear.

11:39.780 --> 11:43.980
In fact, it's the most dangerous
plant in the desert,

11:43.980 --> 11:47.460
and I wouldn't dream of
putting my hand anywhere near it

11:47.460 --> 11:49.620
without proper protection.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.380
Brush against it...

11:54.380 --> 11:55.660
..this can happen.

11:55.660 --> 11:56.980
Ow!

11:56.980 --> 11:58.900
This can happen,
even with this glove on.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.180
One of them has just gone through,
I can feel it.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.540
It's quite painful!

12:04.460 --> 12:07.940
Look closely at the spine
and you can see very clearly

12:07.940 --> 12:09.460
why they're so dangerous.

12:10.660 --> 12:12.940
Each is like a splinter of glass,

12:12.940 --> 12:14.980
sharp enough to pierce flesh...

12:16.540 --> 12:19.540
..and they're covered
with backward-pointing barbs.

12:20.980 --> 12:25.140
So getting them out, even with a
pair of pliers, is quite hard.

12:25.140 --> 12:28.900
This is not pleasant at all.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.100
It won't come off, or without.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.980
Oh, look at that!

12:36.700 --> 12:41.300
It's hard to imagine a more
aggressive defence than this,

12:41.300 --> 12:45.500
and it makes both the plant and its
buds virtually invulnerable.

12:56.980 --> 13:00.060
Most animals know to keep clear.

13:03.380 --> 13:08.060
Cholla buds grow like tiny barrels
from the top of the adult plant

13:08.060 --> 13:10.780
and then drop off.

13:19.100 --> 13:22.500
If the young cholla
put down roots here,

13:22.500 --> 13:25.900
it would compete with
its parent for water.

13:28.380 --> 13:30.060
Night falls...

13:31.980 --> 13:34.260
..and this one is on the move.

13:43.900 --> 13:48.380
A pack rat. She knows how to deal
with a cholla.

13:54.260 --> 13:57.060
She avoids the spines by gripping
it at the place

13:57.060 --> 13:59.420
where it broke off from its parent.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.940
And she works fast.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.660
There are pack rat hunters here.

14:21.300 --> 14:26.220
She uses the cholla to build a spiny
wall around her nest.

14:43.180 --> 14:45.980
The flesh of the cholla
supplies her with water...

14:47.620 --> 14:52.700
..and the severed spines
further reinforce the defences.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.260
This cholla bud...

15:07.860 --> 15:08.900
..might be next.

15:12.780 --> 15:15.460
But one accidental nudge...

15:19.900 --> 15:22.020
..and it escapes.

15:48.780 --> 15:51.980
The bud starts to put down roots.

16:00.140 --> 16:03.380
So, the cholla,
thanks to the pack rats,

16:03.380 --> 16:05.900
finds new territory

16:05.900 --> 16:08.100
and sets about claiming it.

16:16.540 --> 16:21.660
Few plants deal with the problems
of desert living better than cacti.

16:23.580 --> 16:28.100
There are almost 2,000 different
species of them.

16:28.100 --> 16:31.660
They're spread across the deserts
of the American West,

16:31.660 --> 16:35.940
from Arizona,
all the way to Mexico and beyond.

16:41.020 --> 16:44.940
In South America, the ice-covered
peaks of the Andes

16:44.940 --> 16:46.740
act as a rain barrier...

16:48.500 --> 16:52.940
..beyond which
lies the world's driest desert -

16:52.940 --> 16:54.580
the Atacama.

17:03.340 --> 17:07.580
In the desert world, water thieves
can come in many forms

17:07.580 --> 17:11.660
to exploit even the smallest chink
in a plant's defence.

17:17.660 --> 17:20.820
One of the strangest
travels within the gut

17:20.820 --> 17:23.220
of a fruit-eating mockingbird.

17:30.140 --> 17:34.140
These are the seeds
of Tristerix,

17:34.140 --> 17:36.460
a kind of mistletoe.

17:39.500 --> 17:44.900
Their goal is the water
inside this hedgehog cactus.

17:47.140 --> 17:49.500
Using the spines as anchors,

17:49.500 --> 17:52.260
the seeds start to germinate.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.060
Each produces a long probe

17:58.060 --> 18:00.900
with which to try and locate
the cactus' skin.

18:04.220 --> 18:07.020
For most,
that's a stretch too far,

18:07.020 --> 18:09.220
and they perish.

18:11.460 --> 18:16.780
But for this one, the cactus'
surface is within reach.

18:25.660 --> 18:28.500
It clamps onto it
with a special sucker...

18:32.020 --> 18:34.740
..and then waits for darkness.

18:37.140 --> 18:41.460
At night, the cactus opens its pores
in order to respire.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.540
Oxygen goes out,

18:46.540 --> 18:50.300
carbon dioxide goes in,

18:50.300 --> 18:52.220
and so does Tristerix.

18:57.660 --> 19:03.020
Once within, its tissues spread
throughout the body of the cactus,

19:03.020 --> 19:06.860
sustained by the precious store
of water that they find there.

19:12.580 --> 19:14.620
Then, a year later,

19:14.620 --> 19:17.180
it breaks
through the cactus' skin...

19:23.940 --> 19:26.140
..and bursts into flower.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.540
Hummingbirds come to drink
their nectar

19:46.540 --> 19:49.180
and pollinate them as they do so.

19:59.860 --> 20:02.420
And, then, to complete the cycle,

20:02.420 --> 20:07.140
Tristerix produces hundreds
of white, eye-catching seeds,

20:07.140 --> 20:09.660
ready to be carried away by a bird

20:09.660 --> 20:12.420
to invade another cactus.

20:23.740 --> 20:26.540
The Karoo Desert in southern
Africa.

20:28.780 --> 20:31.060
And although it may look bare,

20:31.060 --> 20:35.540
its rocky ground contains an
unrivalled variety of plants that,

20:35.540 --> 20:39.060
one way or another,
store water in their tissues.

20:41.860 --> 20:44.980
They belong to many different
families, but as a group,

20:44.980 --> 20:47.500
they're known as succulents.

21:05.980 --> 21:09.580
Some are small and low
and barely distinguishable

21:09.580 --> 21:11.340
from their surroundings.

21:13.260 --> 21:16.140
These look like little pebbles.

21:18.060 --> 21:20.740
They resemble them so closely

21:20.740 --> 21:24.980
that animals which might be only too
glad to steal their water

21:24.980 --> 21:27.460
just pass them by.

21:30.500 --> 21:34.940
When rain does fall,
they absorb it and quickly expand.

21:37.300 --> 21:40.500
But even this
doesn't spoil their disguise.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.380
They just look like larger pebbles.

21:44.780 --> 21:46.900
Nor are they green.

21:46.900 --> 21:50.180
The cells on their top surface
are transparent

21:50.180 --> 21:52.540
and allow sunlight to pass through.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.540
Deep within and out of sight

21:56.540 --> 22:00.580
are the green cells
where photosynthesis occurs -

22:00.580 --> 22:04.900
the process which uses this light
to make food for the plant.

22:11.380 --> 22:14.260
When the time comes to reproduce,
however,

22:14.260 --> 22:18.620
the stone plant
abandons its disguise.

22:38.900 --> 22:42.140
And now, it blooms.

22:49.740 --> 22:54.060
The flowers open and close
every 24 hours.

23:02.900 --> 23:05.380
So for a few dangerous days,

23:05.380 --> 23:08.100
the plant advertises for pollinators

23:08.100 --> 23:10.940
before returning to life
as a pebble.

23:25.780 --> 23:29.380
Some desert plants
have developed a very different way

23:29.380 --> 23:31.260
of attracting pollinators.

23:33.060 --> 23:36.060
This is a Stapelia.

23:36.060 --> 23:41.540
It produces what is perhaps
the desert's strangest disguise.

23:41.540 --> 23:44.180
It uses water stored in its stems

23:44.180 --> 23:48.140
to grow buds
the size of tennis balls.

24:07.500 --> 24:12.020
The flower, once opened,
is called a desert starfish.

24:15.060 --> 24:18.500
Instead of releasing millions
of loose pollen grains

24:18.500 --> 24:20.460
as most flowers do,

24:20.460 --> 24:25.260
the desert starfish produces them
packed in five tiny sacks.

24:27.660 --> 24:30.140
But if its strategy is successful,

24:30.140 --> 24:34.140
just one of them
will produce hundreds of seeds...

24:37.940 --> 24:40.580
..and this depends on deception.

24:43.900 --> 24:46.140
The flower appears to have hair...

24:48.060 --> 24:50.980
..wrinkly skin...

24:53.100 --> 24:57.300
..and it produces a stench
like the carcass of a dead animal.

25:11.780 --> 25:14.580
And when a carrion fly
investigates...

25:17.060 --> 25:21.340
..the flower tempts a tiny sack
of pollen to its proboscis.

25:28.660 --> 25:33.460
It isn't easy to feed
with such encumbered mouthparts.

25:35.260 --> 25:38.380
But try as it might,
the fly can't get rid of it.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.660
And it's still there when the fly
leaves to try and feed

25:44.660 --> 25:47.260
from another bogus carcass.

25:52.740 --> 25:55.700
This time, however,
when its clamped-up proboscis

25:55.700 --> 25:59.740
slots into the flower,
the pollen sack is released.

26:06.020 --> 26:08.300
With pollination complete,

26:08.300 --> 26:10.660
the fly is no longer needed...

26:14.540 --> 26:16.700
..and just as well.

26:21.820 --> 26:25.780
Some deserts can be so dry
that plants must find techniques

26:25.780 --> 26:30.020
of surviving for long periods
without any water whatsoever.

26:31.260 --> 26:36.100
One of them
is to grow extremely slowly,

26:36.100 --> 26:40.500
and few plants grow more slowly
than this one -

26:40.500 --> 26:42.700
the creosote bush.

26:43.780 --> 26:46.180
It is inactive for most of its life

26:46.180 --> 26:50.340
and only wakes up and grows
for a brief period,

26:50.340 --> 26:53.300
if and when
there is a fall of rain.

26:56.860 --> 27:01.140
I've seen evidence of this
"grow slow" strategy for myself.

27:02.340 --> 27:06.340
40 years ago, I came here
to California's Mojave Desert

27:06.340 --> 27:09.020
to visit one particular plant.

27:10.260 --> 27:12.700
An individual
creosote bush

27:12.700 --> 27:15.740
tends to spread
not by setting seeds

27:15.740 --> 27:17.980
and producing a new generation,

27:17.980 --> 27:22.220
but by sending out new stems
around its base.

27:22.220 --> 27:27.980
This plant started growing between
10,000 and 12,000 years ago.

27:29.660 --> 27:31.940
That was in 1982.

27:35.100 --> 27:40.420
Since then, careful measurement
has shown that it has increased

27:40.420 --> 27:43.980
its size by less than one inch.

27:46.500 --> 27:50.260
Its ability to endure
is truly extraordinary.

27:54.780 --> 27:58.940
So efficient is creosote
at collecting what little rain

27:58.940 --> 28:02.380
falls here, that few other plants
can compete with it.

28:02.380 --> 28:06.820
As a result,
over the last 12,000 years,

28:06.820 --> 28:10.900
it's come to completely
dominate this landscape.

28:26.700 --> 28:31.220
The Chihuahuan Desert
in north Mexico.

28:31.220 --> 28:36.140
Here, one particular plant
plays the waiting game so well

28:36.140 --> 28:39.260
that it spends much of its life
looking dead

28:39.260 --> 28:41.540
and certainly not worth eating.

28:44.820 --> 28:48.660
And it can survive like this
for a decade.

28:56.300 --> 28:59.220
This is the resurrection plant.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.780
It's a kind of moss.

29:04.780 --> 29:09.220
It barely has roots, and it
certainly can't store much water,

29:09.220 --> 29:11.460
but it can travel.

29:18.020 --> 29:20.220
After a particularly long drought...

29:21.660 --> 29:23.620
..it breaks away from its roots...

29:26.180 --> 29:27.340
..and becomes...

29:28.980 --> 29:30.460
..a tumbleweed.

29:33.220 --> 29:35.220
Blowing across the desert,

29:35.220 --> 29:38.300
it can travel a mile in a week.

29:41.140 --> 29:43.780
With luck, it may find water.

29:47.020 --> 29:49.140
THUNDER RUMBLES

29:51.140 --> 29:54.780
Just a shower of rain
can bring it back to life.

29:59.700 --> 30:03.620
As its fronds soak up the water,
they unfurl.

30:17.740 --> 30:19.700
In its protected centre,

30:19.700 --> 30:21.700
it still has green cells

30:21.700 --> 30:24.460
which absorb both the water
and sunlight

30:24.460 --> 30:29.700
and rapidly produce the food
it needs to resume its growth.

30:34.620 --> 30:37.620
It will grow for just as long
as there is moisture...

30:42.420 --> 30:44.380
..but when that disappears...

30:45.980 --> 30:48.260
..it closes up once more

30:48.260 --> 30:51.140
and resumes its travels.

31:00.780 --> 31:03.380
Here in the Canyonlands of Utah

31:03.380 --> 31:05.900
lives a plant that has developed

31:05.900 --> 31:08.060
a finely-balanced relationship

31:08.060 --> 31:11.820
with the animals with which
it shares this dramatic desert.

31:16.780 --> 31:19.660
Rain does occasionally fall here

31:19.660 --> 31:23.460
and turns dust into mud.

31:27.940 --> 31:30.380
But that doesn't last long.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.460
A brief window of opportunity opens.

31:45.180 --> 31:47.460
Seeds that have been buried
for years

31:47.460 --> 31:50.540
may now be exposed to light

31:50.540 --> 31:52.980
and come to life.

32:09.660 --> 32:13.020
This is coyote tobacco.

32:25.780 --> 32:29.180
In just a few weeks,
it grows a metre tall

32:29.180 --> 32:31.980
and produces dozens of flowers.

32:38.460 --> 32:41.980
The night air becomes heavy
with their fragrance.

32:44.060 --> 32:46.300
Soon, they attract hawk moths

32:46.300 --> 32:48.260
which sip their nectar,

32:48.260 --> 32:50.540
and in doing so, pollinate them.

32:52.900 --> 32:55.980
But the moths also
lay their eggs on them.

33:12.340 --> 33:15.220
Soon, the caterpillars have hatched

33:15.220 --> 33:16.980
and are munching the leaves.

33:20.380 --> 33:24.900
Their nibbles expose the plant's
sap to the drying air.

33:27.900 --> 33:31.540
But the tobacco plant has a defence.

33:33.900 --> 33:37.460
The leaves under attack
produce nicotine.

33:41.820 --> 33:44.460
This chemical
sedates the caterpillars

33:44.460 --> 33:46.780
and slows them down.

33:52.260 --> 33:55.780
And what is more, it makes them give
off a particular scent...

33:58.980 --> 34:01.300
..one that summons others

34:01.300 --> 34:03.940
to come to the plant's aid.

34:05.820 --> 34:07.580
Big-eyed bugs,

34:07.580 --> 34:10.900
miniature assassins,
only two millimetres long...

34:12.780 --> 34:14.580
..and whiptail lizards.

34:16.380 --> 34:19.860
Big or small, they make
a meal of the caterpillars.

34:30.380 --> 34:32.540
It's certainly effective...

34:35.340 --> 34:38.860
..but there's more to this strategy
than meets the eye.

34:41.060 --> 34:45.980
When the leaf of a tobacco plant
is attacked by a caterpillar,

34:45.980 --> 34:50.660
all the rest of the leaves
prepare to defend themselves.

34:50.660 --> 34:53.740
But how does this leaf know

34:53.740 --> 34:56.980
that that leaf there
is under attack?

34:56.980 --> 35:00.660
Well, scientists here
in the United States

35:00.660 --> 35:04.300
have specially genetically modified
these tobacco plants

35:04.300 --> 35:07.140
so that under special
lighting conditions,

35:07.140 --> 35:11.580
this microscope can show us
exactly what is going on.

35:14.180 --> 35:17.620
I'm going to attack one
of the leaves of this plant

35:17.620 --> 35:21.100
with these tweezers which,
to the plant,

35:21.100 --> 35:23.940
will seem as if it's being nibbled
by a caterpillar.

35:38.580 --> 35:41.340
Signals are being transmitted
along the veins

35:41.340 --> 35:45.180
that link the leaf
to the rest of the plant.

35:45.180 --> 35:48.220
It's rather like
a very simple nervous system.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.900
From that initial injury,

35:54.900 --> 35:58.820
the whole of this little plant is
aware that something has happened.

36:03.420 --> 36:08.020
This signal warns each leaf
of the danger,

36:08.020 --> 36:10.940
so that it is ready
to produce nicotine

36:10.940 --> 36:13.100
the moment it's attacked.

36:15.860 --> 36:17.860
With this defence at the ready,

36:17.860 --> 36:20.540
the tobacco plant
can continue to grow

36:20.540 --> 36:23.420
until eventually, it produces seeds.

36:36.980 --> 36:39.700
It's particularly important
in deserts

36:39.700 --> 36:44.220
for seeds to be distributed as
widely as possible

36:44.220 --> 36:48.300
so that some will have a chance
of reaching moisture.

36:50.500 --> 36:54.540
And deserts have an excellent
agent to help them do that -

36:56.580 --> 36:58.260
the wind.

37:00.540 --> 37:05.340
Many seeds have adaptations
to help them exploit it.

37:05.340 --> 37:10.420
They have shell to protect
the seeds within from abrasion

37:10.420 --> 37:13.620
or wings to help them catch the air.

37:18.060 --> 37:20.420
As the temperature rises
throughout the day,

37:20.420 --> 37:22.660
desert winds increase in strength.

37:47.060 --> 37:48.980
Here in Arizona,

37:48.980 --> 37:54.180
the land is regularly swept by what
is known as a haboob.

37:54.180 --> 37:56.380
It's a giant sandstorm,

37:56.380 --> 38:00.180
but also, in effect, a seed storm.

38:07.740 --> 38:11.780
Countless millions of them
are swept up into the air.

38:17.700 --> 38:21.780
Some seeds can travel
thousands of miles on the wind...

38:24.780 --> 38:29.780
..so that plants may eventually
reach even the most isolated desert.

38:39.060 --> 38:41.820
Some have landed on an island

38:41.820 --> 38:45.260
in the middle of the world's
largest salt flat in Bolivia.

38:50.820 --> 38:56.060
In the Galapagos, they sprout
on fields of recently-erupted lava.

39:03.420 --> 39:08.940
They've even reached one of the most
inhospitable of all sites -

39:08.940 --> 39:12.660
the tiny island of San Pedro Martir,

39:12.660 --> 39:15.220
a scorched, lonely rock

39:15.220 --> 39:17.060
off the coast of Mexico.

39:21.300 --> 39:24.700
This is the home of
the giant cardon,

39:24.700 --> 39:27.540
a species of huge cactus

39:27.540 --> 39:30.100
that can weigh up to 12 tonnes.

39:38.220 --> 39:43.100
They're able to thrive here because
of an extraordinary partnership...

39:46.300 --> 39:50.340
..with brown and blue-footed
boobies.

39:55.260 --> 39:58.060
The cardones here
can become so broad

39:58.060 --> 40:02.300
that they provide cooling
shade for nesting birds.

40:13.820 --> 40:16.660
As the booby chicks get older,

40:16.660 --> 40:19.260
they repay the cardones...

40:25.060 --> 40:26.540
..with their droppings...

40:28.100 --> 40:29.500
..guano -

40:29.500 --> 40:33.740
the digestive remains
of vast shoals of fish.

40:35.380 --> 40:38.900
This guano is of such
strength and quantity

40:38.900 --> 40:42.060
that most plants
would be poisoned by it.

40:48.460 --> 40:51.780
These cardones, however,
have evolved the ability

40:51.780 --> 40:56.500
to tolerate the toxins in the
guano and digest the nutrients.

40:58.620 --> 41:02.420
As a result, the cacti
now grow in a dense forest

41:02.420 --> 41:04.020
over a million strong.

41:09.500 --> 41:12.860
But such relationships
are very finely balanced

41:12.860 --> 41:15.980
and can only too easily
tip into catastrophe...

41:19.420 --> 41:22.420
..as is now happening
in northern Zimbabwe.

41:26.620 --> 41:28.460
For six months of the year,

41:28.460 --> 41:32.700
the savannah here is kept lush
and green by daily rains.

41:37.980 --> 41:39.460
ELEPHANTS TRUMPET

41:41.180 --> 41:44.060
But when the rainy season is over,

41:44.060 --> 41:46.780
it becomes as dry as any desert.

41:52.180 --> 41:57.140
So to survive here, trees must be
able to tolerate both conditions.

41:59.460 --> 42:04.380
And these giants
are adapted to do just that.

42:04.380 --> 42:06.460
They are baobabs.

42:14.340 --> 42:17.900
This one might be over
1,000 years old.

42:17.900 --> 42:21.500
It survives here in part
thanks to its ability

42:21.500 --> 42:24.500
to store thousands
of litres of water

42:24.500 --> 42:27.100
within the spongy wood of its trunk.

42:30.780 --> 42:33.980
But its battered surface is evidence

42:33.980 --> 42:36.820
of a very finely-balanced
relationship.

42:38.700 --> 42:40.620
These huge trees

42:40.620 --> 42:44.580
are a focus for animals
of all kinds.

42:48.260 --> 42:51.900
And they're particularly
important for elephants.

42:56.420 --> 43:00.180
In the wet season,
they eat the baobab's fruit

43:00.180 --> 43:02.660
and disperse the
seeds in their dung.

43:08.180 --> 43:10.580
Now as the dry season begins...

43:12.180 --> 43:15.340
..they migrate
to distant watering holes.

43:19.660 --> 43:22.220
The baobabs have damp inner wood...

43:23.700 --> 43:29.380
..and the elephants use it to
quench their thirst on the journey.

43:48.020 --> 43:51.780
This relationship can only
work because baobabs

43:51.780 --> 43:55.020
have a remarkable
ability to heal themselves.

44:13.900 --> 44:16.900
Between each damaging attack,

44:16.900 --> 44:20.620
they expand their spongy
wood and grow new skin.

44:25.020 --> 44:29.140
And they've done this
time and time again over centuries.

44:33.820 --> 44:38.020
Today, however, it's harder
for the baobabs to recover

44:38.020 --> 44:42.980
as dry seasons become longer
and drier due to climate change.

44:45.140 --> 44:48.980
Not only that, but the elephants
are forced to take ever more wood

44:48.980 --> 44:51.820
from the trees in order to survive.

44:57.460 --> 44:59.220
In some parts of Africa,

44:59.220 --> 45:02.100
many of the largest
and oldest baobabs

45:02.100 --> 45:04.540
have fallen in the last decade.

45:17.540 --> 45:20.740
The loss of a vital species
like the baobab

45:20.740 --> 45:23.780
strikes a blow at all life
in the desert.

45:28.780 --> 45:30.660
In these hostile lands,

45:30.660 --> 45:35.180
few living organisms can survive
without help from others.

45:40.140 --> 45:43.580
You can find an extraordinary
illustration of this

45:43.580 --> 45:46.100
in Arizona's saguaro country.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.860
If you wander off
the beaten track here,

45:55.860 --> 45:59.340
you may be lucky enough
to find one of these.

45:59.340 --> 46:02.100
It might look like an old boot,

46:02.100 --> 46:06.340
but in fact,
it's part of a saguaro cactus.

46:06.340 --> 46:09.620
Almost every saguaro has one.

46:09.620 --> 46:11.220
There's one up there.

46:15.660 --> 46:19.620
It has been produced
indirectly by woodpeckers,

46:19.620 --> 46:23.740
which regularly dig homes for
themselves in the bloated trunks

46:23.740 --> 46:25.460
of the saguaros.

46:38.660 --> 46:40.580
In the next six months,

46:40.580 --> 46:43.460
the cactus heals the wound

46:43.460 --> 46:47.700
and so creates a safe,
cool, and watertight nest hole.

46:50.500 --> 46:53.180
Its tough lining
will persist for years,

46:53.180 --> 46:57.260
even after the cactus itself
has died and rotted away.

47:01.380 --> 47:06.300
A single saguaro may hold several
of these extraordinary homes.

47:09.140 --> 47:15.060
So over its lifetime, it may provide
accommodation for some 3,000 chicks

47:15.060 --> 47:18.140
of several different species.

47:24.340 --> 47:26.980
But in the long term,
the saguaro benefits,

47:26.980 --> 47:29.860
as their lodgers repay the cactus

47:29.860 --> 47:32.820
by pollinating its flowers...

47:34.260 --> 47:36.780
..and dispersing its seeds.

47:44.260 --> 47:46.380
It's relationships like these

47:46.380 --> 47:48.380
that enable life to flourish

47:48.380 --> 47:51.460
in some of the world's
harshest landscapes.

48:04.980 --> 48:06.980
Over millions of years,

48:06.980 --> 48:10.100
plants have become superbly adapted

48:10.100 --> 48:12.340
to hostile desert conditions.

48:12.340 --> 48:15.820
But it's a very
finely-balanced existence

48:15.820 --> 48:18.940
and one that makes them
uniquely vulnerable.

48:21.500 --> 48:25.220
However, our growing understanding
of the complex ways

48:25.220 --> 48:28.860
by which desert animals and plants
rely on one another

48:28.860 --> 48:33.100
is now helping us to understand
how best we can protect them.

48:37.940 --> 48:42.340
90 years ago, a photograph
was taken from this very spot

48:42.340 --> 48:45.660
that shows a population
of saguaro cactus

48:45.660 --> 48:48.620
that was very different
from what it is today.

48:51.380 --> 48:52.820
In the last 50 years,

48:52.820 --> 48:57.220
the population of saguaros
here has greatly diminished,

48:57.220 --> 49:00.780
not because of a direct
assault on the cactus,

49:00.780 --> 49:03.620
but because many of the
shade-giving nurse trees

49:03.620 --> 49:08.460
were harvested for firewood, leaving
young saguaro to die in the sun.

49:13.620 --> 49:16.580
Now that this relationship
is understood

49:16.580 --> 49:18.700
and the nurse trees are protected,

49:18.700 --> 49:23.580
there are already signs
that the saguaro are recovering.

49:27.020 --> 49:32.060
Wherever there's a desert, plants
have evolved to meet its challenge.

49:33.780 --> 49:36.260
But everywhere, they need our help.

49:38.420 --> 49:40.140
As we understand more about them

49:40.140 --> 49:43.140
and their intimate and
complex relationships...

49:44.660 --> 49:49.220
..we will be better able to
protect them and all life

49:49.220 --> 49:53.860
in these beautiful but
increasingly fragile worlds.

50:08.180 --> 50:11.340
The most remote shoot
for the deserts team

50:11.340 --> 50:13.980
is to the island of
San Pedro Martir

50:13.980 --> 50:16.300
in the Sea of Cortez, Mexico.

50:19.700 --> 50:22.100
They are to film the giant cacti

50:22.100 --> 50:24.780
that have found a unique way
to thrive here.

50:27.580 --> 50:31.580
It takes 48 hours
to travel the 260 miles...

50:32.940 --> 50:35.500
..over unpleasantly choppy seas.

50:41.820 --> 50:43.860
It's not made some of
us feel very well.

50:43.860 --> 50:46.980
I think one of us is quite seasick.

50:48.460 --> 50:50.980
It's nothing but big blue out there,

50:50.980 --> 50:53.620
and the island is
somewhere in that direction.

50:53.620 --> 50:55.100
Can't see it yet.

50:56.940 --> 50:59.100
As they draw close to the island,

50:59.100 --> 51:04.220
there's a spectacular reminder of
how rich life in the sea is here.

51:04.220 --> 51:07.180
Oh, look in front of us!
Look at that for a pod!

51:08.660 --> 51:10.460
Oh! They're everywhere!

51:16.460 --> 51:17.740
Show us the way.

51:24.700 --> 51:28.620
Meeting them here
is desert scientist Ben Wilder.

51:30.060 --> 51:33.100
It's through his research
that the team first heard

51:33.100 --> 51:36.420
about the island's
peculiar residents.

51:36.420 --> 51:39.020
I'll never forget
the first time I came

51:39.020 --> 51:41.660
to, actually, exactly where
we're standing right now.

51:41.660 --> 51:44.100
It was April of 2006,

51:44.100 --> 51:46.660
and saw this view.

51:46.660 --> 51:52.460
And it both settled in my
heart and captivated my mind.

51:52.460 --> 51:57.940
And so that started a process
of trying to understand,

51:57.940 --> 52:00.460
you know, what can produce this?

52:02.500 --> 52:06.340
The secret is in the
relationship between the cactus

52:06.340 --> 52:09.980
and a type of
sea bird called a booby.

52:12.140 --> 52:14.780
All the boobies that we need
to film are right up there

52:14.780 --> 52:16.020
at the top of the island.

52:16.020 --> 52:18.900
So, it's going to be
a bit of a scramble.

52:20.540 --> 52:24.100
The crew soon discover how
harsh the conditions are here.

52:25.780 --> 52:28.180
I'm pretty tired. It's pretty hot.

52:28.180 --> 52:29.500
It's a great view.

52:36.460 --> 52:37.940
There's very few places on Earth

52:37.940 --> 52:39.820
where you're going to
see this many cactus.

52:39.820 --> 52:43.020
I mean, it's absolutely amazing.

52:43.020 --> 52:45.380
I would say this is the only
place you're going to see this.

52:45.380 --> 52:47.100
Well, there you go, then.

52:48.940 --> 52:52.860
Ben's research is uncovering
the ingenious ways the cacti

52:52.860 --> 52:55.460
have adapted to the conditions here.

52:56.940 --> 52:59.860
The waters just offshore here
are some of the most productive

52:59.860 --> 53:01.420
marine waters in the world.

53:01.420 --> 53:04.420
And so it's kind of an ideal
habitat for sea birds to roost.

53:04.420 --> 53:08.420
But when they do so,
they deposit tonnes of guano.

53:08.420 --> 53:12.460
And so those nutrients, really high
in nitrogen and phosphorus,

53:12.460 --> 53:16.300
actually are toxic
to most plant species.

53:16.300 --> 53:19.500
The cardones thrive because
they're uniquely able

53:19.500 --> 53:24.060
to process the guano and extract
what they need to fuel their growth.

53:26.780 --> 53:29.340
One of the first shots
the crew need to get

53:29.340 --> 53:32.180
is of the boobies
nesting under the cacti.

53:33.780 --> 53:37.380
The lack of predators means
the birds aren't afraid of people.

53:37.380 --> 53:41.860
It should make filming
them up close a bit easier.

53:41.860 --> 53:43.500
That's the theory.

53:43.500 --> 53:46.380
So we've positioned this camera here
to try and get a good perspective

53:46.380 --> 53:48.580
on the chick on the nest.

53:48.580 --> 53:51.460
It's taken quite a
liking to our camera.

53:51.460 --> 53:53.980
Let's hope he doesn't break it.

53:59.660 --> 54:00.820
Bull's-eye.

54:00.820 --> 54:03.500
It's pooed right on
the front of the lens!

54:03.500 --> 54:05.900
It's kind of a shot we need,
but unfortunately,

54:05.900 --> 54:07.780
my camera wasn't rolling
at the time it did it.

54:07.780 --> 54:09.820
So now, I've just got a dirty lens.

54:12.780 --> 54:16.900
After a thorough lens clean,
Ollie eventually gets the shot

54:16.900 --> 54:21.340
to reveal the extraordinary
relationship between bird and plant.

54:25.420 --> 54:27.940
But it's not just the
bird guano that influence

54:27.940 --> 54:29.620
how the cardones grow.

54:30.700 --> 54:34.180
They're way shorter,
they're dwarfed here,

54:34.180 --> 54:35.780
throughout the rest of their range,

54:35.780 --> 54:38.380
they usually get in
upwards of 50-60 feet.

54:38.380 --> 54:42.460
But here, on average,
they're 20-24 feet in height.

54:42.460 --> 54:46.100
They stop growing up,
and they grow out.

54:47.780 --> 54:51.500
Ben's research suggests
that they go wide here

54:51.500 --> 54:54.740
as an adaptation
to the violent winds.

54:54.740 --> 54:57.860
Too tall, and they'd blow over.

54:57.860 --> 55:01.700
A gusting wind isn't
helping the drone crew, either.

55:01.700 --> 55:03.340
We really need it
to calm down a bit,

55:03.340 --> 55:05.340
otherwise it's
going to be impossible.

55:11.580 --> 55:12.940
WIND GUSTS

55:29.580 --> 55:32.980
On the Sonoran mainland, where the
cardon is also found,

55:32.980 --> 55:37.060
you have on average between
50 to 150 plants per hectare.

55:37.060 --> 55:42.860
Here on this island, you have
over 2,500 plants per hectare.

55:42.860 --> 55:46.780
A lull in the wind, and the
team get the chance to reveal

55:46.780 --> 55:49.620
the remarkable density of the cacti,

55:49.620 --> 55:53.820
almost 20 times greater
than anywhere else.

55:53.820 --> 55:56.940
It appears that here
they're doing very well.

55:58.220 --> 56:01.220
But even this island isn't isolated

56:01.220 --> 56:03.660
from the effects
of a changing planet.

56:04.940 --> 56:06.740
Every cactus you see there,

56:06.740 --> 56:10.900
its body is filled with
nutrients from the sea.

56:10.900 --> 56:14.940
Given that we know that the
cardones are linked to the ocean,

56:14.940 --> 56:18.380
what happens in the oceans
affects what happens to the cardon.

56:18.380 --> 56:22.380
So a concern we have right now is
that there's a lot of overfishing,

56:22.380 --> 56:27.100
and we know there are less sea birds
here than there were 20 years ago.

56:27.100 --> 56:31.340
And we have reason to believe
then that will ripple and affect

56:31.340 --> 56:34.660
the nutrients that fuel
the cardones as well.

56:36.620 --> 56:40.220
This finely-balanced relationship
is at risk,

56:40.220 --> 56:42.940
and knowing that
makes leaving the island

56:42.940 --> 56:45.620
particularly thought provoking
for the crew.

56:47.020 --> 56:49.180
The cardones look beautiful.

56:49.180 --> 56:51.380
I've never seen so
many cactus in my life.

56:51.380 --> 56:53.300
It's absolutely amazing.

56:53.300 --> 56:55.940
I'm just hoping that when
we leave this place,

56:55.940 --> 56:59.980
it stays as it is, and things
don't affect it that are negative.

56:59.980 --> 57:03.260
It's an absolutely wonderful thing,
and, yeah, I don't want to go.

57:03.260 --> 57:04.580
I want to stay.

57:05.900 --> 57:10.740
This remote cactus forest is
a reminder of the adaptability

57:10.740 --> 57:15.020
of plants that enables them
to establish green worlds

57:15.020 --> 57:17.300
almost anywhere on Earth.

57:21.940 --> 57:24.700
Next time on The Green Planet...

57:24.700 --> 57:28.060
..our extraordinary relationship
with plants.

57:30.380 --> 57:32.260
From those who eat...

57:35.620 --> 57:37.380
..to those we help...

57:39.420 --> 57:42.180
..plants are our greatest allies.

57:45.140 --> 57:48.620
The Open University
has produced a poster

57:48.620 --> 57:53.140
that explores the vital role
that plants have for our planet.
