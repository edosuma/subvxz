- ls he all right?

11:53.227 --> 11:56.227
- He's drunk, ma'am.
- My son isn't like that.

11:56.357 --> 11:59.437
His breathalyzer test is like that.

12:02.447 --> 12:06.367

- I'd say in about an hour.

12:08.497 --> 12:13.047

- Melvin Belli. Can I help you?

12:13.167 --> 12:14.707
Yes. Um...

12:14.837 --> 12:18.426
I was attacked by a man.
He tried to rape me.

12:30.596 --> 12:33.136

Victim Reporting.
'...upon returning to her car was accosted

12:38.486 --> 12:42.826
by above-described suspect in a ski mask,
who then produced a knife

12:42.946 --> 12:47.206
and stated that he would cut her
if she did not drive away from the mall.'

12:47.326 --> 12:50.666
'Тhe VR complied
as the suspect was adamant,

12:50.786 --> 12:57.536
at which location suspect then asked the
VR to touch him about the sexual organs.'

12:57.666 --> 13:01.336
- 'Тhe VR complied'.
- No, I didn't.

13:02.086 --> 13:04.756
- But that's what you just told me.
- No.

13:04.886 --> 13:10.725
I told you he put the knife to my throat
and I did what he said to do.

13:10.845 --> 13:13.805
I don't like your wording.

13:13.935 --> 13:18.195
Can't find her file. You ever been
picked up for prostitution before?

13:18.315 --> 13:20.275
- Fred.
- What?

13:20.395 --> 13:23.685
Wrong woman. Over there.

13:25.115 --> 13:27.955
I'm sorry.

13:30.195 --> 13:32.785
Look, Marjorie, it's a form.

13:32.905 --> 13:36.405
It's how we have to write it.
It's just the facts.

13:36.535 --> 13:40.205
Joanne, they found her car in the mall.

13:40.335 --> 13:41.535
Thanks.

13:41.665 --> 13:45.165
Well, they'll tow it and dust it,

13:45.295 --> 13:49.175
but without a description,
even if we do get prints,

13:49.305 --> 13:54.775
it still comes down to your word
against his and that means he gets off.

13:54.885 --> 13:58.134
What do you mean he gets off?

13:58.264 --> 14:01.434
I'm sorry. I'm just telling you straight.

14:04.894 --> 14:09.154
He has my wallet.
He knows where I live.

14:09.274 --> 14:12.944
Can you give me some protection?

14:13.074 --> 14:15.284
You call and we'll be there.

14:17.874 --> 14:19.924
Thanks.

14:20.794 --> 14:23.544
You didn't sign it.

14:23.664 --> 14:27.254
We can't take action if you didn't sign it.

14:48.523 --> 14:52.313
- Debby, is your father home?
- Yeah.

14:52.443 --> 14:55.193
tell him lunch is ready.

15:03.663 --> 15:06.543
Daddy, mommy says lunch is ready.

15:06.663 --> 15:09.333
Be right there, baby.

15:25.143 --> 15:27.683
Could you not smoke at the table?

15:32.443 --> 15:37.192
This is for the front door,
the back door and the garage.

15:38.202 --> 15:41.792
- Does that hurt?
- It's not that bad.

15:41.912 --> 15:45.372
I think you should let somebody look at it.

15:45.502 --> 15:48.172
You really ought to.

15:51.632 --> 15:56.302
- Your supper's here.
- It's here? Oh, good, it's Bob.

15:56.422 --> 15:59.052
- He's so cute.
- What happened to Tony?

15:59.182 --> 16:04.442
You know. He went to San Diego.
He doesn't call me any more.

16:04.562 --> 16:07.732
Hey, Bob. How you doin'? How's it going?

16:07.852 --> 16:09.772
- I'm just fine.
- Good.

16:09.892 --> 16:14.022
- You got a pizza with the works.
- Yeah. Just put it on the table.

16:14.152 --> 16:17.942
- Looks like I'm just in time for supper.
- Would you like a piece?

16:18.072 --> 16:20.482
I'd love a piece.

16:21.612 --> 16:25.531
- You're all right.
- That's what they tell me.

16:26.621 --> 16:32.201
- So, how many of you girls live here?
- It's none of your business.

16:32.331 --> 16:34.501
Pay him.

16:34.631 --> 16:37.511
Here, Bob. It's ok. Just keep it.

16:38.921 --> 16:42.011
- What's he looking at?
- Ok, thanks.

18:04.259 --> 18:06.839
- Push that down for me, please.
- Morning.

18:06.969 --> 18:07.750
Morning.

18:07.763 --> 18:10.139
Boy, did y'all hear
those cats last night?

18:10.269 --> 18:15.109
Yes. I also heard Marjorie
walking around all night.

18:15.849 --> 18:19.769
- Are you working at home today?
- I don't know.

18:20.729 --> 18:25.609
- What are you buying?
- Thinking about getting a gun.

18:25.739 --> 18:29.420
I think we should talk
about that tonight.

18:29.433 --> 18:30.909
Listen to this.

18:31.039 --> 18:36.089
'For security and when you're ready for
adventure. Major credit cards accepted.'

18:36.209 --> 18:39.469
If you buy a gun,
either you or I are moving out.

18:39.589 --> 18:43.889
If you're not using your car today
do you think I could borrow it?

18:44.009 --> 18:48.429
- I need it this afternoon.
- This temp job quits at three.

18:48.549 --> 18:50.929
- I'll be back.
- What's wrong with yours?

18:51.059 --> 18:54.518
- The points, plugs and battery.
- You should get rid of it.

18:54.638 --> 18:57.138
- I will.
- Feed the birds and the fish.

18:57.268 --> 18:59.598
- Bye-bye.
- I'll call you later.

18:59.728 --> 19:03.438
- Pick up my dry-cleaning?
- Sure, yeah.

19:03.568 --> 19:06.188
- Great. Thank you.
- Wait, wait.

19:06.318 --> 19:09.108
- Ah.
- Oh, good. Eat it on the way.

19:09.238 --> 19:11.278
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:12.658 --> 19:14.698
Bye.

19:40.228 --> 19:43.687
Good morning. You hungry?

19:46.857 --> 19:48.897
Come on.

20:48.416 --> 20:50.336
Damn it!

20:50.466 --> 20:52.516
Damn!

22:35.524 --> 22:38.144
Hi. ls Joe in?

22:39.324 --> 22:41.204
- Joe?
- Yeah, Joe.

22:41.324 --> 22:43.664
No Joe lives here.

22:43.784 --> 22:46.404
What, did he move out?

22:46.534 --> 22:50.454
Do you always just walk
into people's houses?

22:52.664 --> 22:54.704
Well... well...

22:55.464 --> 22:58.384
I'm really sorry, lady.

22:58.504 --> 23:01.253
- I'm really sorry. I...
- It's ok.

23:03.513 --> 23:06.023
Well, have a good day.

23:06.133 --> 23:08.173
You too.

23:09.103 --> 23:12.193
Thank you very much. You live here?

23:12.313 --> 23:14.193
Good guess.

23:14.313 --> 23:17.893
- ls it all right if I use the phone?
- No. I'm sorry.

23:18.023 --> 23:21.023
- It's a local call.
- No. You have to go.

23:21.153 --> 23:23.193
There's the door.

23:25.613 --> 23:27.863
I know where the door is.

23:27.993 --> 23:31.573
You don't have to tell me
where the door is.

23:37.793 --> 23:39.833
I'm sorry.

23:45.093 --> 23:48.673
You know, this is a real bitch.

23:51.012 --> 23:56.012
You see, this guy owes me a lot of money.
He says come by and pick it up.

23:56.142 --> 23:59.482
- I think you have the wrong house.
- No, it's this house.

23:59.602 --> 24:04.862
I know it's this house. You don't
know him? He's about six foot two.

24:04.982 --> 24:08.652
He's got a red beard. He rides
a Triumph. He wears cowboy boots.

24:08.782 --> 24:11.452
There's no Joe here.

24:11.572 --> 24:14.242
Are you sure, sweetheart?

24:15.042 --> 24:18.422
Maybe my husband knows. He's upstairs.

24:20.172 --> 24:24.642
- Could you go ask him for me?
- No. He's sleeping.

24:25.342 --> 24:27.382
He's sleeping?

24:29.802 --> 24:32.472
- He's a cop.
- No kidding.

24:36.222 --> 24:43.101
Could you just do me a little favour? Just
go ask him if he knows a guy named Joe.

24:43.231 --> 24:45.981
Honey, come down here.

24:48.571 --> 24:50.611
Honey?

24:53.031 --> 24:55.911
Boy, that cop's a sound sleeper.

24:56.871 --> 25:02.251
Honey?

25:08.471 --> 25:12.811
Just like a cop, huh?
Never there when you need 'em.

25:13.891 --> 25:19.191
What's the matter with him?
Maybe he ain't up there, hm?

25:19.311 --> 25:23.021
Maybe you're telling me a little lie, huh?

25:36.410 --> 25:41.160
Go ahead. Go for the door.
Let's see who's faster this time.

26:20.869 --> 26:24.579
So, where's Patty and Terry?
Upstairs too?

26:32.759 --> 26:36.679
What are we worried about, huh?
We got all day.

26:44.189 --> 26:46.239
Ow!

26:47.859 --> 26:49.529
Upstairs.

26:49.649 --> 26:52.269
- Hey! Hey!
- Ok.

26:52.399 --> 26:55.689
- Are you gonna be nice?
- Yes. Yes! Yes.

26:57.569 --> 26:59.569
Wait!

26:59.699 --> 27:02.069
Ok. Ok.

27:02.199 --> 27:04.239
Please. Ok.

27:08.458 --> 27:10.498
Ok. Ok.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.968

27:14.718 --> 27:17.428
- Where's your room?
- There.

27:40.158 --> 27:42.198
Invite me in.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.668
Come in.

27:49.788 --> 27:51.828
Thank you.

28:01.547 --> 28:04.137
Nice place.

28:04.267 --> 28:06.317
Say thank you.

28:09.057 --> 28:11.227
Thank you.

28:50.056 --> 28:53.346
Smile. Come on, smile.

28:54.936 --> 28:56.976
Smile.

29:05.866 --> 29:08.406
What's that?

29:20.426 --> 29:23.016
I'm an artist too.

29:23.136 --> 29:25.976
Poems.

29:26.096 --> 29:28.936
What kind of poetry?

29:29.056 --> 29:39.395
Get up on the bed.

29:45.735 --> 29:48.615
Stand up on the bed.

31:49.153 --> 31:51.533
Get dressed.

32:16.092 --> 32:18.762
What did I just tell you?

32:30.612 --> 32:33.322
Take off the robe.

32:39.662 --> 32:41.712
Turn around.

32:47.462 --> 32:50.132
Christ, you are beautiful.

32:52.042 --> 32:54.081
Beautiful.

33:08.181 --> 33:10.681
Offer me something.

33:10.811 --> 33:12.851
- What?
- Beer.

33:15.281 --> 33:17.321
It's downstairs.

33:19.651 --> 33:21.941
Well, go get it.

33:27.001 --> 33:28.461
Ok.

33:48.060 --> 33:51.440
What do you think? I'm fuckin' stupid?

33:55.020 --> 33:57.270
Did I hurt you?

33:57.400 --> 33:58.480
No.

33:58.610 --> 34:01.440
Yes, I did. I'm so sorry.

34:01.570 --> 34:04.450
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.090
I'm sorry.

34:22.050 --> 34:24.719
You know what we're gonna do?

34:25.679 --> 34:27.719
Go downstairs...

34:29.100 --> 34:31.679
and get the wine.

34:32.518 --> 34:34.559
Ok?

35:16.099 --> 35:18.849
Open that fuckin' door now...

35:19.649 --> 35:22.308
or I'll kill you.

35:24.948 --> 35:26.998
Open it!

35:52.308 --> 35:55.068
Do you have anything to say to me?

35:57.398 --> 35:59.448
I'm sorry.

36:00.818 --> 36:03.568
I can't trust you, can I?

36:08.568 --> 36:12.067
- You wanna act like a little dog?
- No. No.

36:14.787 --> 36:16.827
- Know how I treat a dog?
- No.

36:16.957 --> 36:20.007
I'll treat you like a dog, then. Ok?

36:20.127 --> 36:22.427
Come on, puppy. Come on, puppy.

36:24.007 --> 36:27.557
Come on. Come on, puppy.
Come on. Come on.

36:32.057 --> 36:34.107
don't.

37:01.496 --> 37:04.166
Make me something to eat.

37:06.456 --> 37:09.336
- What would you like?
- Steak.

37:10.676 --> 37:14.306
We don't have any meat.

37:14.426 --> 37:18.926
I come home
and you got nothin' to fuckin' eat?

37:20.726 --> 37:23.886
We have bacon. We have lots of bacon.

37:24.016 --> 37:26.856
I can make you bacon and eggs.

38:51.684 --> 38:54.984
- Who's this?
- Terry's boyfriend.

38:55.114 --> 38:57.494
Tony?

38:57.614 --> 38:59.914
Yes.

39:13.424 --> 39:17.724
You fuckin' throw that butter
and you're dead.

39:22.474 --> 39:25.064
What are you doin'? Huh?

39:27.354 --> 39:29.813
Huh? Making popcorn?

39:35.153 --> 39:36.493
Huh?

39:42.403 --> 39:44.443
No.

40:28.202 --> 40:31.282
Take this off. You look like a whore.

40:33.202 --> 40:35.412
Take it off.

41:14.291 --> 41:17.091
Lt doesn't have to be this way.

41:37.231 --> 41:39.191
- Are you gonna be nice?
- Yes.

41:39.311 --> 41:42.521
Yes! Yes!

42:10.510 --> 42:13.510
Don't make your lips tight.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.690
Kiss me nice.

42:15.810 --> 42:17.860
Nice. Nice.

42:24.270 --> 42:26.310
I said nice.

42:52.549 --> 42:54.879
How'd you get this?

43:07.979 --> 43:10.729
Kiss me and tell me you love me.

43:12.069 --> 43:15.149
- Tell me.
- I love you.

43:15.279 --> 43:17.949
Again. And say it nicer.

43:18.739 --> 43:20.779
I love you.

43:23.789 --> 43:25.409
Again.

43:25.539 --> 43:27.579
I love you.

43:29.959 --> 43:32.799
I like how you say that.

43:34.679 --> 43:39.438
So sweet.

43:41.348 --> 43:44.008
Kiss me. Kiss me.

43:44.938 --> 43:46.988
Touch me.

43:51.068 --> 43:53.118
Kiss me...

43:54.198 --> 43:56.998
and tell me you wanna make love.

43:57.118 --> 43:59.958
l- I love you and...

44:01.578 --> 44:03.988
kiss me.

44:04.118 --> 44:07.118
- And what else?
- I love you...

44:07.248 --> 44:12.208
- what else, huh? And what else?
- I... wanna... make love.

44:14.508 --> 44:17.478
You wanna make love?

44:17.588 --> 44:19.628
Say it. Say it.

44:19.758 --> 44:22.428
I wanna make love.

44:27.807 --> 44:31.057
- Again.
- I wanna make love.

44:31.727 --> 44:34.397
Oh, god, you say it so sweet.

44:35.317 --> 44:40.107
So sweet.

44:43.907 --> 44:46.487
I... I love you.

44:48.827 --> 44:52.627
I love you. I love you. I love you.

44:55.257 --> 44:57.467
I love you.

44:58.177 --> 45:00.477
Argh!

46:11.165 --> 46:13.375
Where are you?

46:13.495 --> 46:16.375
What did you put in my fuckin' eye?

46:17.415 --> 46:19.795
Bitch.

46:19.915 --> 46:22.795
Fuckin' bitch. I'll kill ya.

46:22.925 --> 46:24.975
I'll kill ya.

46:33.855 --> 46:36.655
Where are you, you fuckin' cunt?

47:21.144 --> 47:23.434
What are you doin'? Huh?

47:36.744 --> 47:38.784
Where you going?

47:39.914 --> 47:42.334
Go ahead!

47:42.464 --> 47:44.803
Go ahead! Call the cops!

47:44.923 --> 47:47.763
You can't prove a fuckin' thing!

47:47.883 --> 47:51.683
You got no witnesses.
You got no come up your snatch.

47:51.803 --> 47:57.173
You got nothin', pussy.
They're gonna Miranda me and let me go.

48:12.073 --> 48:13.233
Come on!

48:28.173 --> 48:30.213
Come on. Come on!

48:35.182 --> 48:38.182
Go ahead! Get the fuckin' cops!

48:38.302 --> 48:40.632
You can't prove a thing!

48:40.762 --> 48:43.432
It's my word against yours.

48:44.232 --> 48:46.532
They gotta let me go.

49:16.172 --> 49:18.922
They lock me up.

49:19.052 --> 49:21.342
I get out.

49:21.642 --> 49:23.681
I get you.

49:34.481 --> 49:39.491
Who the fuck do you think
you're playing with, bitch?

49:43.241 --> 49:46.031
Even if they lock me up...

49:46.161 --> 49:48.831
I'll come back and I'll get you.

51:18.089 --> 51:21.879
- Marjorie. Marjorie!
- Don't say my name.

51:22.879 --> 51:27.549
Marjorie, get me out! Get me outta here!

51:27.679 --> 51:30.349
I can't be locked up like this.

51:31.519 --> 51:35.639
Come here. Let me talk to you.
Please, talk to me.

51:36.819 --> 51:38.859
I just wanna...

51:41.029 --> 51:43.699
let me outta here!

52:18.978 --> 52:21.648
Marjorie, I'm home, on time.

52:29.618 --> 52:31.208
Marjorie.

52:33.288 --> 52:35.328
It's him.

52:36.288 --> 52:39.368
He tried to rape me.

52:39.498 --> 52:41.667
Shit. Are you all right?

52:41.797 --> 52:44.507
Please, god, help me.

52:47.637 --> 52:50.347
What did I say about talking?

52:50.467 --> 52:54.467
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
We've gotta call the police.

52:54.597 --> 52:57.477
- On what charge?
- Rape.

52:58.557 --> 53:01.017
Lt wasn't a rape.

53:01.147 --> 53:04.437
- Attempted rape.
- You can't prove attempted rape.

53:04.567 --> 53:07.317
You should call the police, now.

53:08.157 --> 53:10.207
Do it.

53:11.487 --> 53:14.237
Animal ripped it outta the wall.

53:15.657 --> 53:19.117
- I'll go in the car.
- No, Terry.

53:19.247 --> 53:22.827
No, Terry. We can't prove anything.

53:22.957 --> 53:25.587
The police have to let him go.

53:25.717 --> 53:28.467
He said he'd come back and get us.

53:29.467 --> 53:33.676
Us, Terry. Me, you, Pat.

53:35.596 --> 53:39.726
You would have found me dead.
Then he'd rape you.

53:40.556 --> 53:43.096
Don't do this to me.

53:43.226 --> 53:46.316
- You have to help me.
- What can I do?

53:47.276 --> 53:50.026
Help me make him disappear.

53:50.156 --> 53:52.956
- Let's wait for pat.
- We don't need pat.

53:53.076 --> 53:55.626
- We only need the shovel.
- The shovel?

53:55.746 --> 53:59.046
- To dig the hole.
- Oh, my god.

54:00.746 --> 54:03.076
Choose.

54:03.206 --> 54:05.246
Him or us.

54:06.666 --> 54:10.086
Choose. Him or us.

54:10.966 --> 54:13.626
Him. l- I mean us.

54:14.636 --> 54:17.596
Just dig the hole. I'll do the rest.

54:19.185 --> 54:21.685
- Don't let me see it.
- See what?

54:21.805 --> 54:24.685
- The blood.
- What blood?

54:24.815 --> 54:29.985
I'm gonna drag him out and
put him in the hole and cover him up.

54:30.105 --> 54:34.065
I started the grave between
the tomatoes and the flowerbed.

54:34.195 --> 54:36.865
The ground's soft there.

54:40.415 --> 54:44.255
- I'd rather you dig.
- Then watch him.

54:44.375 --> 54:48.135
- I'd rather you watch.
- I can't do both.

54:48.255 --> 54:50.675
You dig.

54:50.795 --> 54:55.125
Then watch him,
and don't leave him for one second.

55:24.454 --> 55:26.494
Psst!

55:30.294 --> 55:33.664
She gone?

55:33.794 --> 55:35.834
My god.

55:36.754 --> 55:50.264
Come here.

55:55.064 --> 55:58.523
Terry, my eyes are killing me.
She sprayed some stuff in it.

55:58.653 --> 56:02.023
I don't know why. I gotta get to a doctor.

56:02.153 --> 56:05.953
Really, you gotta get me
outta here. Please.

56:10.873 --> 56:12.873
Terry.

56:13.003 --> 56:17.433
I just asked her to use the phone.
My ice-cream truck broke down.

56:17.543 --> 56:22.293
I wanted to call the office
before the ice cream melted.

56:27.473 --> 56:31.933
You know, you're not being
very smart, terry. Really.

56:32.063 --> 56:34.523
You ever hear
of a thing called complicity?

56:34.643 --> 56:37.853
All right. That means
you sit there like an asshole,

56:37.983 --> 56:41.313
and you watch somebody else do a crime.

56:45.953 --> 56:48.002
Marjorie?

56:50.202 --> 56:56.292
- Let's think about this some more.
- Get back in there. I said watch him.

57:08.802 --> 57:11.142
Terry.

57:11.262 --> 57:14.812
I'm not interested
in what you have to say.

57:14.932 --> 57:18.232
And my attorney?
Are you interested in what he has to say?

57:18.352 --> 57:22.652
When you're in the witness chair
and he goes 'tell the court what you did

57:22.782 --> 57:25.832
when wacko was digging
and my client was suffering

57:25.952 --> 57:29.962
and begged you to open the cage.'
And Terry says 'nothing'.

57:30.082 --> 57:34.882
And his honour hits you with croak one
and you go the iron hyatt. The wall.

57:35.002 --> 57:37.051
Shut up.

57:41.461 --> 57:45.171
Can I have a sip of that, please?

57:45.301 --> 57:47.341
No.

57:58.521 --> 58:00.561
You catholic?

58:01.941 --> 58:04.311
What are you gonna say at confession?

58:04.441 --> 58:07.611
'Bless me for I have sinned.
I buried the ice-cream man.'

58:07.741 --> 58:11.121
That ain't gonna go over big.
What's father gonna say?

58:11.241 --> 58:15.621
'Say three hail Marys. Don't do it again'?
He's gonna break out the handcuffs.

58:15.751 --> 58:19.001
Will you shut up?

58:19.121 --> 58:22.961
I understand. You're doing it
for your good friend Marjorie, huh?

58:23.091 --> 58:26.970
It's nice, huh,
to have a friend like that, huh?

58:27.090 --> 58:29.840
You borrow her car.

58:29.970 --> 58:32.840
She borrows your boyfriend, Tony.

58:37.430 --> 58:41.020
- What did you say?
- Now you want something from me, huh?

58:41.150 --> 58:45.570
But when I ask you
for a little drink you give me shit.

58:47.990 --> 58:51.250
- Tell me what she said.
- Look.

58:51.360 --> 58:56.200
You know, nobody likes
to be the one to bring the bad news.

58:56.910 --> 58:58.950
She's fuckin' him.

59:05.250 --> 59:07.920
Goddamn liar.

59:18.179 --> 59:20.679
It's deep enough.

59:20.809 --> 59:25.639
- Help me get him out.
- I'm not gonna touch him.

59:25.769 --> 59:29.439
- You said you'd help me.
- I never said that.

59:32.279 --> 59:35.779
I'll drag him myself. Bring the shovel.

59:35.909 --> 59:37.529
Look.

59:37.659 --> 59:42.539
I don't know what happened here
but I'm not committing complicity for you.

59:43.169 --> 59:46.589
Look, guys. Cherry cheesecake.

59:52.089 --> 59:54.129
it's him.

59:54.889 --> 59:57.519
He tried to rape her again.

01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:03.559
Are you ok?

01:00:03.689 --> 01:00:05.738
I think so.

01:00:17.738 --> 01:00:20.488
How did he get like that?

01:00:20.618 --> 01:00:22.658
I did it.

01:00:24.618 --> 01:00:26.368
Alone?

01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:27.618
Yes.

01:00:30.088 --> 01:00:32.128
And you're ok?

01:00:34.258 --> 01:00:36.718
- When?
- After you left.

01:00:38.178 --> 01:00:40.338
All day?

01:00:52.528 --> 01:00:54.578
Where's the police?

01:01:00.287 --> 01:01:02.917
- Did you call?
- No.

01:01:03.907 --> 01:01:07.157
- Why not?
- Because they'll let him go.

01:01:07.957 --> 01:01:10.747
Marjorie, they'll lock him up.

01:01:10.877 --> 01:01:13.747
He's not leaving this house.

01:01:14.757 --> 01:01:19.467
- I'm going to a booth and calling them.
- You're not going anywhere.

01:01:19.597 --> 01:01:23.807
Marjorie, you're in shock
and don't know what you're saying.

01:01:23.927 --> 01:01:28.057
I'm not in shock.
I know exactly what I'm saying.

01:01:29.517 --> 01:01:31.727
My keys, please.

01:01:34.567 --> 01:01:40.317
- Then I guess I'll have to walk.
- If you leave this house, he dies.

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:43.737
Marjorie, you don't really mean that.

01:01:49.786 --> 01:01:53.286
- We'll talk about it.
- I'm done talking.

01:02:04.636 --> 01:02:09.596
- She's out of her mind.
- Are you all right? What happened?

01:02:15.026 --> 01:02:17.366
Don't go near him.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.316
- No talking to the animal.
- Why not?

01:02:22.446 --> 01:02:25.866
Because he's mine, and I say you can't.

01:02:25.996 --> 01:02:28.046
Ok.

01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:31.466
- Everything is fine.
- Everything is not fine.

01:02:31.576 --> 01:02:35.495
Ok, ok.
Let's just calm the hell down.

01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:37.955
Oh, Jesus. I feel sick.

01:02:40.045 --> 01:02:43.125
She sprayed that stuff over there
in my eyes and mouth.

01:02:43.255 --> 01:02:47.385
Talk again, and I'll smash you
like a fuckin' bug.

01:02:48.635 --> 01:02:52.175
'Harmful or fatal if swallowed,
inhaled or absorbed through skin.'

01:02:52.305 --> 01:02:54.845
'Get immediate attention.
Atropine is antidotal.'

01:02:54.975 --> 01:02:57.145
What the hell does that mean?

01:02:59.895 --> 01:03:01.935
Fuckin' son of a bitch.

01:03:02.065 --> 01:03:06.615
Let me remind you he is a human being
just like you or me.

01:03:06.745 --> 01:03:10.375
Like who?
Don't include me with that animal.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:14.745
- What do you intend to do with him?
- I'm not one of your social-work cases.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:17.625
- Ok.
- So stop the superior bullshit.

01:03:17.755 --> 01:03:22.175
- Jesus. We can't keep him like a pet.
- Will you keep out of this?

01:03:22.295 --> 01:03:25.214
You're interrupting Patricia's routine.

01:03:25.344 --> 01:03:27.974
Yeah, right.
This has nothing to do with me.

01:03:28.094 --> 01:03:33.674
Marjorie, a man is badly hurt
and you don't have a case.

01:03:33.804 --> 01:03:36.474
That's why I have a hammer.

01:03:37.434 --> 01:03:41.104
Ok. Let's talk about the hammer.

01:03:49.824 --> 01:03:52.784
- What do you want from him?
- A confession.

01:03:52.914 --> 01:03:55.164
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:03:55.284 --> 01:03:58.744
Good. That's something solid.

01:03:58.874 --> 01:04:01.454
What happened at the car...

01:04:01.584 --> 01:04:04.044
and today... everything...

01:04:04.964 --> 01:04:06.674
fact for fact.

01:04:06.804 --> 01:04:10.604
- Good.
- Tell 'em what you did to me.

01:04:10.724 --> 01:04:13.393
I didn't do nothin'.

01:04:17.223 --> 01:04:23.723
- This is your chance to save yourself.
- Tell 'em how you tried to smother me.

01:04:24.443 --> 01:04:28.993
Look at her and look at me.
Who did what to who?

01:04:29.573 --> 01:04:32.663
Tell them how you made me touch you.

01:04:32.783 --> 01:04:37.743
No innocent person's got nothin'
to fear in this country.

01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:44.173
Now, I'm not saying one more word
until I talk to my attorney. That's that.

01:04:48.423 --> 01:04:51.753
It's his word against mine.

01:04:52.473 --> 01:04:55.643
Maybe we should make up a story.

01:04:55.763 --> 01:04:58.433
Do we have something to be afraid of?

01:04:58.563 --> 01:05:01.313
They're gonna lock us up
and throw away the keys.

01:05:01.433 --> 01:05:04.682
- Shut up, idiot!
- You shut up!

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:12.832
I'm sorry.

01:05:18.532 --> 01:05:22.952
At the moment, you still have a choice.

01:05:25.042 --> 01:05:27.412
But if he dies -

01:05:28.542 --> 01:05:33.502
and he could be dying right now -
you have no more choice.

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:39.192
Neither do I.

01:05:42.312 --> 01:05:46.232
Let's get the antidote at the drugstore.

01:05:46.352 --> 01:05:48.232
No.

01:05:48.352 --> 01:05:51.981
Let's put some bread in his mouth
to absorb the poison.

01:05:52.111 --> 01:05:53.691
No.

01:05:55.781 --> 01:05:58.361
One slice?

01:06:02.451 --> 01:06:04.581
Do it.

01:06:06.411 --> 01:06:08.701
Thank you.

01:06:26.351 --> 01:06:28.851
God bless you.

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:51.550
My throat. I can't swallow.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:59.460
- Can I please have some water?
- Maybe you'd like a beer.

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:05.550
I just want some water. Please.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.810
Terry, get him a glass of water.

01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:10.680
- What?
- Get him a glass of water.

01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:21.780
I want that atropine from the drugstore.

01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:28.620
For my good, right?

01:07:32.079 --> 01:07:35.539
Marjorie, I want that atropine.

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:59.019
- I'll let Terry go.
- Where?

01:08:00.279 --> 01:08:03.359
Go to the drugstore at the mall.

01:08:03.489 --> 01:08:06.489
- What time is it?
- It's 5:35.

01:08:07.449 --> 01:08:11.079
I want you back here
at five of or he's dead.

01:08:13.879 --> 01:08:17.389
If you bring the police I'll do it, Terry.

01:08:18.249 --> 01:08:21.917
And it'll be just like you did it.

01:09:21.647 --> 01:09:25.067
- it doesn't take that long.
- She'll be here.

01:09:25.197 --> 01:09:28.207
- She's gone to the police.
- She wouldn't do that.

01:09:28.317 --> 01:09:32.197
I should have crushed his skull.
But I let myself talk.

01:09:32.327 --> 01:09:34.577
Marjorie, wait.

01:09:34.707 --> 01:09:37.296
I wanna talk to you. Just one minute.

01:09:37.417 --> 01:09:39.587
- Move.
- Wait. Ok. Marjorie...

01:09:39.707 --> 01:09:42.877
I'm not gonna spend my life
waiting for him to find me.

01:09:43.006 --> 01:09:45.216
- You won't have to.
- Move.

01:09:45.337 --> 01:09:46.457
- No.
- Move.

01:09:46.587 --> 01:09:50.837
- No. Wait, you can't do this.
- Don't tell me what I can do.

01:09:50.966 --> 01:09:54.557
I can't let you do it.
Wait. She's coming back.

01:09:54.677 --> 01:09:56.057
- Move, Pat.
- No.

01:09:56.187 --> 01:10:01.156
Marjorie, don't do it.
Terry is coming back. Give her time. No!

01:10:05.526 --> 01:10:08.686
- You don't wanna go to jail.
- Get out of my way.

01:10:08.816 --> 01:10:10.986
- Stop! Wait!
- I'm back.

01:10:11.116 --> 01:10:14.876
I'm back. Please don't kill him.
I didn't get the police.

01:10:14.996 --> 01:10:16.916
- Oh, thank god.
- It's ok.

01:10:17.036 --> 01:10:18.826
- Thank god.
- It's ok.

01:10:18.956 --> 01:10:20.996
- Thank god.
- Ok, ok.

01:10:29.756 --> 01:10:32.716
Patty: Terry? This isn't atropine.

01:10:32.846 --> 01:10:38.186
It's a prescription drug, idiot.
You need a doctor's signature.

01:10:38.306 --> 01:10:41.476
- May I take him out to give the medicine?
- No.

01:10:41.606 --> 01:10:43.026
- Come on.
- No.

01:10:43.146 --> 01:10:44.686
Stop it!

01:10:44.816 --> 01:10:47.936
What the fuck is happening here?

01:10:48.945 --> 01:10:54.875
Haven't you caused enough pain?
You're alive. You weren't raped.

01:10:54.985 --> 01:10:57.905
Don't think you can do
anything about it - you can't.

01:10:58.035 --> 01:11:03.035
Because I know.
I got raped by my girlfriend's father.

01:11:06.795 --> 01:11:09.455
He drove me home from the party.

01:11:11.465 --> 01:11:13.675
And I couldn't...

01:11:13.805 --> 01:11:16.685
I couldn't get him off of me.

01:11:18.095 --> 01:11:20.135
And I couldn't scream.

01:11:22.935 --> 01:11:27.645
And every time that I saw him
I just had to smile.

01:11:34.775 --> 01:11:36.815
You see, Marjorie...

01:11:39.954 --> 01:11:42.834
I couldn't hurt anybody.

01:11:42.954 --> 01:11:48.124
So I just made believe
that it was a bad dream.

01:11:48.254 --> 01:11:50.924
And it went away.

01:11:52.384 --> 01:11:56.514
And I'm not...
I'm not gonna go to prison for you.

01:11:59.384 --> 01:12:01.214
So, please...

01:12:06.224 --> 01:12:09.974
just let Pat apply some medicine, ok?

01:12:13.484 --> 01:12:15.524
Open it.

01:12:46.473 --> 01:12:49.053
Pat, I'd be careful.

01:12:57.363 --> 01:12:59.533
God bless you.

01:13:14.293 --> 01:13:16.333
ls it bad?

01:13:20.842 --> 01:13:24.002
- Am I gonna go blind?
- I don't know.

01:13:24.132 --> 01:13:26.422
- What?
- I don't know.

01:13:30.142 --> 01:13:33.312
Please take me to a hospital.

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:35.992
Be still.

01:13:36.102 --> 01:13:38.352
You have to sit up.

01:13:43.282 --> 01:13:46.652
Jesus, give me my keys.
We have to take him to a hospital.

01:13:46.782 --> 01:13:49.282
Why don't you just fuck him?

01:13:49.412 --> 01:13:53.082
- Can't you see the man's in pain?
- What do you think I'm in?

01:13:53.202 --> 01:13:54.582
He's blind.

01:13:54.712 --> 01:13:59.472
He's not leaving here
until he tells you what happened.

01:14:02.132 --> 01:14:05.842
Will you tell her something
so I can take you to a doctor?

01:14:05.971 --> 01:14:09.981
Tell her something
so I can take you to a doctor!

01:14:17.021 --> 01:14:19.561
I'll talk if she talks.

01:14:24.821 --> 01:14:28.191
- We met each other at a party one night.
- You liar.

01:14:28.321 --> 01:14:30.991
Just let him talk.

01:14:35.211 --> 01:14:38.711
We smoked a joint.
You know, we got a little crazy.

01:14:38.831 --> 01:14:41.461
We went for a ride on my bike.

01:14:41.591 --> 01:14:45.761
- Do you believe him?
- Just let him say it.

01:14:49.931 --> 01:14:53.301
We made love all night,
and it was beautiful.

01:14:53.431 --> 01:14:56.390
- You make me sick.
- Marjorie.

01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:11.080
She told me about her troubles. She was
having trouble with her boyfriend Tony.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.240
He's lying.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.050
Terry.

01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:21.910
Tony...

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:27.430
wrote me some letters.
I never answered them.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:33.010
He stole our mail.
That's how he knows about Tony.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:36.850
You could have told me.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:39.860
- I didn't wanna hurt you.
- Oh.

01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:45.029
Don't you see what he's doing?

01:15:47.399 --> 01:15:50.989
I got a wife. I got a little girl at home.

01:15:52.409 --> 01:15:57.079
I came up here today to straighten
this thing out like two adults.

01:15:57.199 --> 01:16:01.449
I get up here, she goes crazy.

01:16:01.579 --> 01:16:05.459
She starts screaming at me,
throwing things around the house.

01:16:05.589 --> 01:16:09.429
She sprays that shit in my face,
breaks a fuckin' lamp over my head...

01:16:09.549 --> 01:16:14.719
what about the knife at my throat?
Tell 'em about the knife.

01:16:15.599 --> 01:16:18.019
Tell them about the grave.

01:16:18.139 --> 01:16:20.179
What grave?

01:16:23.059 --> 01:16:27.609
Terry comes home
and she decides to dig a grave out back.

01:16:27.729 --> 01:16:30.149
ls that true?

01:16:32.409 --> 01:16:37.538
Between the tomatoes
and the flowers. A fuckin' grave.

01:16:37.658 --> 01:16:40.948
ls there a grave out there?

01:16:41.078 --> 01:16:44.498
- Don't ask me. Ask her.
- I'm asking you.

01:16:45.248 --> 01:16:48.378
I didn't do anything.

01:16:48.508 --> 01:16:51.468
bury me alive, Patty.

01:16:51.588 --> 01:16:54.168
It can't be true.

01:16:54.798 --> 01:17:00.548
Jesus, you know, I'm so sorry
that this thing happened today.

01:17:00.678 --> 01:17:02.968
And I forgive you, Marjorie.

01:17:03.098 --> 01:17:05.768
Marjorie! Marjorie! Marjorie!

01:17:09.608 --> 01:17:12.268
So what is this?

01:17:31.047 --> 01:17:35.177
I use it for work.
I cut open boxes in a warehouse.

01:17:38.297 --> 01:17:41.467
You cut boxes, huh?

01:17:44.017 --> 01:17:46.727
You cuts 'em good, huh?

01:17:48.227 --> 01:17:51.937
It's the kind of knife
they use to gut a deer.

01:17:57.817 --> 01:17:59.357
Wait.

01:17:59.487 --> 01:18:07.747
Smile.

01:18:10.167 --> 01:18:12.207
Nicer.

01:18:15.296 --> 01:18:17.626
Don't make your lips tight.

01:18:25.136 --> 01:18:27.806
Did I hurt you?

01:18:31.726 --> 01:18:34.356
Patty, make her stop.

01:18:43.036 --> 01:18:45.626
Now you kiss me...

01:18:46.366 --> 01:18:49.786
and tell me you wanna make love.

01:18:49.916 --> 01:18:51.616
What?

01:18:52.996 --> 01:19:02.506
Say it.

01:19:04.965 --> 01:19:07.095
- Huh?
- I wanna m...

01:19:09.685 --> 01:19:11.975
say it.

01:19:13.185 --> 01:19:15.855
I wanna make love.

01:19:17.235 --> 01:19:19.285
Say it nice.

01:19:20.235 --> 01:19:21.985
Say it.

01:19:22.115 --> 01:19:24.625
I wanna make love.

01:19:24.735 --> 01:19:26.865
Marjorie: That's nice.

01:19:32.455 --> 01:19:36.085
Where is it you like me
to touch you? I forget.

01:19:38.045 --> 01:19:40.085
What?

01:19:42.095 --> 01:19:44.555
- Nowhere.
- Remind me.

01:19:51.345 --> 01:19:53.634
ls it here?

01:19:53.764 --> 01:19:55.804
Or here?

01:20:00.024 --> 01:20:03.064
Or here? Huh?

01:20:06.404 --> 01:20:08.824
Oh, now I remember.

01:20:10.824 --> 01:20:12.904
It's down here.

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:22.384
Tell them what happened...

01:20:23.844 --> 01:20:27.094
or I'll cut' em off. Tell them.

01:20:27.214 --> 01:20:30.004
Tell them! Tell them!

01:20:31.224 --> 01:20:33.644
Tell them!

01:20:33.764 --> 01:20:37.724
I watched the house! I stole the letters!

01:20:57.083 --> 01:20:59.133
And what else?

01:21:02.753 --> 01:21:04.163
I...

01:21:06.673 --> 01:21:08.083
I...

01:21:10.883 --> 01:21:13.883
I came here to kill you.

01:21:16.473 --> 01:21:18.513
And Patty.

01:21:19.473 --> 01:21:21.513
And Terry.

01:21:27.693 --> 01:21:29.733
Linda Martinez.

01:21:31.402 --> 01:21:33.692
Paula Mikowski.

01:21:36.242 --> 01:21:38.282
Marie Parks.

01:21:39.202 --> 01:21:41.242
Argh!

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:47.622
Thank you. Thank you.

01:22:05.102 --> 01:22:07.892
The first time I did it...

01:22:10.862 --> 01:22:14.822
my wife, she was reading the paper.

01:22:16.492 --> 01:22:18.702
She says 'Joe.'

01:22:18.832 --> 01:22:21.501
'Joe, fix the back door...

01:22:24.661 --> 01:22:28.161
cos I don't want no raper coming in here.'

01:22:30.251 --> 01:22:34.921
And I says...'don't worry, honey.'

01:22:36.431 --> 01:22:39.061
'He don't want you.'

01:22:40.011 --> 01:22:43.181
And I fixed the back door real good...

01:22:44.181 --> 01:22:47.521
so that the raper don't get her.

01:22:48.061 --> 01:22:50.101
Oh, god.

01:23:03.291 --> 01:23:05.341
Marjorie.

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:13.290
Go get the police.

01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:19.340
God.

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.140
I'll stay.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:29.230
I'll stay with you.

01:23:34.530 --> 01:23:36.700
Go with Pat.

01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:42.920
I'm sorry.
