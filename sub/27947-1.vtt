MAN: No!

01:48.934 --> 01:51.372
(UPBEAT MUSIC)

02:12.958 --> 02:15.613
GIRL: Oh, Jack, live a little.

02:22.533 --> 02:25.493
I can not help but be
reminded of a Japanese proverb.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.776
Since I do not know how it is
said in the Mexican culture,

02:28.800 --> 02:32.630
I'll put it into simple terms
that you may understand.

02:34.197 --> 02:37.655
Where there are no
dogs, the fox is king.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.421
But I am no fox, nor dog.

02:42.379 --> 02:44.140
Isn't that right, Armando?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.620
Yes, of course Mr. Nakamura.

02:46.644 --> 02:49.232
In Japan, we have
certain customs

02:49.256 --> 02:52.539
in which we show our
generosity by exchanging gifts.

02:52.563 --> 02:54.541
But you must understand,

02:54.565 --> 02:56.872
those who are selfish
are greatly despised.

02:58.395 --> 03:01.113
You see, in a
wealthy man's house,

03:01.137 --> 03:03.357
there should be no lean dogs.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.448
ARMANDO: You're absolutely
right, Mr. Nakamura.

03:09.014 --> 03:12.255
You consider me a generous
man, do you not, Armando?

03:12.279 --> 03:13.952
Of course, Mr. Nakamura.

03:13.976 --> 03:17.719
Then perhaps I let
my dogs grow too fat?

03:19.547 --> 03:21.984
It is all an
illusion, is it not?

03:23.333 --> 03:26.380
Generosity, selfishness.

03:27.555 --> 03:31.535
In Japan, we consider
both one and the same.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.711
We generously give

03:33.735 --> 03:37.608
and we selfishly hope to get
something back, but better.

03:42.613 --> 03:45.244
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

03:45.268 --> 03:49.359
Even sexual pleasure has
its root in selfishness,

03:50.795 --> 03:53.233
and greed, especially greed.

03:56.671 --> 03:58.629
One must be clever

03:59.543 --> 04:01.545
not to be seen.

04:04.069 --> 04:04.896
Jack.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.290
I'll get to the bottom of it.

04:09.901 --> 04:10.946
I'm sure you will.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.865
Mr. Robertson
will be leaving now.

04:18.736 --> 04:19.737
I'll show him out.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.288
(GROANS)

04:29.312 --> 04:32.857
It has come to my attention
that an error has been made.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.467
My assets have
grown considerably,

04:34.491 --> 04:38.016
but yet my bank accounts do
not reflect my good fortunes.

04:39.322 --> 04:42.388
And every since I entrusted
both you and Mr. Robertson

04:42.412 --> 04:44.501
in keeping my
finances in order...

04:46.851 --> 04:49.961
Do you not see why
this causes me concern?

04:49.985 --> 04:51.354
Look, I understand your concern

04:51.378 --> 04:52.746
With all due respect...

04:52.770 --> 04:54.444
It is said that
even a man of wealth

04:54.468 --> 04:56.359
can even hire the devil.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.665
Although the devil
may deceit the man,

04:58.689 --> 05:01.388
he can never, never
fool the gods.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.418
Have I mistakenly
hired a devil, Armando?

05:12.442 --> 05:14.115
No, sir.

05:14.139 --> 05:16.379
Look, I will send you the
report, you could see it,

05:16.403 --> 05:18.294
you could have Mr.
Robertson see it,

05:18.318 --> 05:20.513
and you'll see how I moved
a few numbers around.

05:20.537 --> 05:21.819
It's...
I'm afraid

05:21.843 --> 05:24.778
Mr. Robertson will be
terminated immediately.

05:24.802 --> 05:29.807
Unless you wish the same, I
will give you one final chance

05:30.634 --> 05:31.983
to undo your unfortunate error,

05:33.202 --> 05:36.921
or we both shall see
who truly is the devil.

05:36.945 --> 05:37.772
Goodbye Armando.

05:53.135 --> 05:53.918
Fuck.

05:55.006 --> 05:57.420
Damn it, Armando, fuck.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.141
A warning would have been nice.

06:00.577 --> 06:01.578
You sound like my wife.

06:04.276 --> 06:05.060
Mm-mm.

06:06.496 --> 06:07.952
What?

06:07.976 --> 06:09.997
I can't return the favor?

06:10.021 --> 06:11.434
Just give me a minute, huh?

06:11.458 --> 06:13.590
And I'm sure we can
work something else out.

06:15.766 --> 06:18.116
(CHUCKLES)

06:23.252 --> 06:24.534
Ah, shit.

06:24.558 --> 06:26.516
Nakamura is on edge
about his finances,

06:27.430 --> 06:28.605
guess I'm staying late.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.696
Now I gotta fix a few things.

06:35.133 --> 06:35.917
Run away with me.

06:37.353 --> 06:38.485
What do you say?

06:39.703 --> 06:41.313
What do you say I ask your wife?

06:42.532 --> 06:44.205
I'm serious, Luna.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.231
Just you and me,
anywhere you want.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.718
Think of it as a permanent
vacation from all of this.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.505
Are you going somewhere?

07:04.336 --> 07:07.339
Never mind, you probably
wouldn't do it anyway.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.213
I wish I could.

07:14.956 --> 07:18.022
Guess that's the difference
between you and me.

07:18.046 --> 07:20.527
When I want something,
I'm not afraid to get it.

07:21.832 --> 07:24.356
Maybe it's time you figure
out what it is you want,

07:25.575 --> 07:28.293

willing to do to get it.

38:43.408 --> 38:44.365
Where's the gun, Luna?

38:45.540 --> 38:47.475
I told you, I don't have it.

38:47.499 --> 38:50.086
He never got in and you know it.

38:50.110 --> 38:51.957
So you're blaming me?

38:51.981 --> 38:53.742
Why would I take the gun?

38:53.766 --> 38:54.960
Where is it?

38:54.984 --> 38:56.527
Why don't you tell me?

38:56.551 --> 38:58.074
How do I know you don't have it?

38:59.554 --> 39:00.468
I guess you don't.

This is crazy, you know
it was on the counter.

39:09.129 --> 39:10.391

get that password.

a way out of here first,

let's call the police

ELENI: Yeah, right.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.721
And tell them what?

40:43.745 --> 40:46.028
That we kidnapped my husband
and threatened to kill him?

40:46.052 --> 40:47.749
We can say he
tried kidnapping us.

40:49.359 --> 40:51.903
No, we are not going anywhere,

40:51.927 --> 40:53.601
and we are not calling anyone.

40:53.625 --> 40:56.671
We have to bring him back here
and take what we came for.

something and I do it.

gonna tell you this one time.

about the account?

about the account?

quick and easy,

or slow

It's entirely up to you.

51:06.367 --> 51:07.910
Eleni's kind of in a bind,

51:07.934 --> 51:10.241
so maybe you ought
to come back inside?

51:13.722 --> 51:15.439

51:15.463 --> 51:17.248
than being out here
with the coyotes.

51:21.034 --> 51:24.081
FYI, they're persistent
little fuckers.

51:26.735 --> 51:28.215
They like to hunt in pairs.

51:29.347 --> 51:30.889
They like to take
little bites out of you

51:30.913 --> 51:32.393
with those sharp-ass teeth.

51:34.482 --> 51:37.877
Maybe for hours until
you're all bled out.

51:39.400 --> 51:41.359
That's when they call
the rest of them.

51:43.926 --> 51:46.035
Then the whole pack comes.

51:46.059 --> 51:47.800
They tear what's
left of you apart.

51:49.367 --> 51:50.890
Something to think about,

51:53.936 --> 51:56.025
if not for yourself, for Eleni.

52:13.260 --> 52:14.392
It was her.

52:16.524 --> 52:18.285
I'd figured you might say that.

52:18.309 --> 52:19.136
It's the truth.

52:20.833 --> 52:21.616
We'll see.

52:25.316 --> 52:29.861
Now, I don't know if you came
across this little tidbit

52:29.885 --> 52:31.559
in your online research.

52:31.583 --> 52:34.301
I swear this was all her idea

52:34.325 --> 52:37.086
The ancient Chinese
had this really

52:37.110 --> 52:40.872
hardcore way of getting information
out of their prisoners.

52:40.896 --> 52:43.812
She came to me and she
said she found the account.

52:45.205 --> 52:48.208
The technique was
called Five Pains.

52:49.644 --> 52:51.472
Yeah, it's not a
catchy name, I know,

52:52.908 --> 52:54.234
but you gotta hand it to them,

52:54.258 --> 52:57.019
the chinks sure know
how to fuck people up.

52:57.043 --> 52:59.219
Why did you put the
money in her name?

53:01.265 --> 53:04.418
Why do you think I came
to your office today?

53:04.442 --> 53:06.531
Don't you see that
she's playing us both?

53:07.619 --> 53:08.402
Maybe.

53:09.664 --> 53:13.102
But I really need
to know from you.

53:14.365 --> 53:17.542
Who else knows
about this account?

53:20.284 --> 53:21.067
No one

53:26.246 --> 53:29.269
So the reason this
technique is called Five Pains

53:29.293 --> 53:30.729
is because, number one,

53:31.904 --> 53:33.795
they chop the person's nose off.

53:33.819 --> 53:37.625
I swear it was all her
idea, every bit of it.

53:37.649 --> 53:39.366
But yes, I went along with it.

53:39.390 --> 53:42.238
Number two and three,

53:42.262 --> 53:45.981
they'd cut off their
hand and their foot.

53:46.005 --> 53:48.549
I'm so sorry I did this to you.

53:48.573 --> 53:49.811
Don't you see?

53:49.835 --> 53:51.421
She knew we'd turn
on each other.

53:51.445 --> 53:54.579
And number four, they'd
castrate the dumb shit.

53:55.884 --> 53:58.428
The problem was that
after all that chopping,

53:58.452 --> 54:02.389
and cutting the person began
spewing all kinds of shit,

54:02.413 --> 54:05.392
so you never really
knew for sure

54:05.416 --> 54:07.568
if that prick was
saying the truth.

have to believe me.

54:25.349 --> 54:27.220
Which brings us to number five.

54:28.395 --> 54:30.547

what number five was.

54:30.571 --> 54:31.766
Please.

54:31.790 --> 54:33.531
It was the punishment
for lying, Eleni!

54:34.749 --> 54:36.316
When they'd slice
the fucker in half!

54:37.361 --> 54:38.362

much of anything.

leave a message for Eleni,

57:09.643 --> 57:10.644
Throw it on the couch.

57:22.090 --> 57:24.286
Put your hands on your head.

57:24.310 --> 57:26.878
I only have one,
thanks to you two.

57:27.661 --> 57:28.749
Do it.

57:32.274 --> 57:34.015
You sure you know
how to use that?

57:35.974 --> 57:38.498
Oh, what about the money?

57:39.717 --> 57:42.478
You shoot me, you
don't get squat.

57:42.502 --> 57:44.983
Yeah, but I'd sure get
the satisfaction of it.

57:48.726 --> 57:52.445
Eleni tells me this whole
shenanigan was your idea,

57:52.469 --> 57:53.837
I would tell you the same shit

57:53.861 --> 57:56.666
if you were breaking
my fucking fingers.

57:56.690 --> 58:01.062
Funny thing is I'm
starting to agree with her.

58:01.086 --> 58:03.523
Well then you're wasting
your time, now get back.

58:11.531 --> 58:13.490
I underestimated you, Luna.

58:14.926 --> 58:17.557
I guess it's not the size
of the dog in the fight.

58:17.581 --> 58:20.018
It's the size of the
fight in the dog.

58:57.664 --> 58:58.902
Don't worry,

58:58.926 --> 59:00.362
I didn't tell him anything.

59:02.103 --> 59:05.430
Admit it, you're
in it for yourself.

59:05.454 --> 59:08.651
Regardless of who found
the account or how,

59:08.675 --> 59:12.829
you set up this dog fight so
we'd tear each other apart

59:12.853 --> 59:13.613
No, no, no, no.

59:13.637 --> 59:14.614
You used me!

59:14.638 --> 59:16.616
Both of you did!

59:16.640 --> 59:17.641
I have proof, Luna

59:18.598 --> 59:20.078
Don't you dare.

59:25.779 --> 59:26.693
Explain this.

59:30.218 --> 59:32.588
Do you know there's
a car parked outside,

59:32.612 --> 59:33.787
hidden under some bushes?

59:34.875 --> 59:35.939
LUNA: What does that
have to do with me?

59:35.963 --> 59:39.508
It's a rental, your rental,

59:39.532 --> 59:41.012
with your signature right on it.

59:43.667 --> 59:45.625

You took the bullets out.

01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:28.078
Put him on the chair.

01:00:28.102 --> 01:00:29.689
LUNA: You unloaded the gun.

01:00:29.713 --> 01:00:30.646
I knew you'd take it.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:31.628
I would never leave it loaded.

01:00:33.412 --> 01:00:34.955
Now!

01:00:34.979 --> 01:00:36.652
Give me the gun.

01:00:36.676 --> 01:00:38.915
Give me the gun!

01:00:58.437 --> 01:00:59.177
No.

01:01:00.134 --> 01:01:00.961
It's over, Luna.

01:01:02.397 --> 01:01:03.398
They'll come for me.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.682
They'll figure everything out.

01:01:06.706 --> 01:01:08.403
They're gonna come
for all of us.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.455
Was it worth it, babe?

01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:21.025
How about you?

01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:24.071
I'm sorry.

01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:27.137
You're good, Luna.

01:01:27.161 --> 01:01:27.945
Too good.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.820
Give me something to write with.

01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:37.084

01:01:43.525 --> 01:01:44.677

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:45.658
It doesn't matter.

01:01:50.228 --> 01:01:52.815
I worked too fucking
hard for this money

01:01:52.839 --> 01:01:54.295
to let it go to waste.

01:01:54.319 --> 01:01:55.929
ELENI: No, baby, it won't.

01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:59.150
Remember what I told you?

01:02:01.152 --> 01:02:03.696
We said a lot of things, Mondo,

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.828
a lot of things
I wish we hadn't.

01:02:05.852 --> 01:02:07.724
When you asked about the money,

01:02:09.813 --> 01:02:11.878
I said I'd give you half.

01:02:11.902 --> 01:02:13.793
(COUGHS)

01:02:13.817 --> 01:02:16.471
Well, I'm a man of my word.

01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:26.830
Take it.

01:02:27.918 --> 01:02:30.877
Keep it, you fuckin' deserve it.

01:02:32.836 --> 01:02:34.814
You wanted the password?

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:36.448
Now you could both
fight over it.

01:02:37.971 --> 01:02:39.843
Every stinkin' penny.

01:02:41.496 --> 01:02:42.909

Fuck, fuck, fuck, you
fucking fuck, fuck!

01:02:47.372 --> 01:02:48.677
Eleni, take it easy.

01:02:50.288 --> 01:02:51.961
Give me your half then.

01:02:51.985 --> 01:02:53.770
I never said I would do that.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.183
How about now?

01:02:56.207 --> 01:02:58.011
We don't even know if
that's the real password.

01:02:58.035 --> 01:03:00.056
Yes, that's the real deal.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.232
You can call the bank and check.

01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:04.887
Consider it my gift to you both,

01:03:04.911 --> 01:03:06.913
or one of you anyway.

I'm too tired for this shit.

01:03:48.172 --> 01:03:50.130
You don't leave me
much choice, Luna.

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:57.442
Come on, give me that paper.

01:03:59.618 --> 01:04:02.795
You have about 10 seconds
before I open the door for you.

Just think this
through a minute.

01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:37.023
I swear to god, Eleni,
I don't care anymore.

01:04:37.047 --> 01:04:38.938
Okay, alright,

01:04:38.962 --> 01:04:41.027
give it to me and
I'll let you go.

01:04:41.051 --> 01:04:42.376
You want me to believe that?

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.291
You've been lying to
me this whole time.

01:04:44.315 --> 01:04:45.901
And you haven't?

01:04:45.925 --> 01:04:48.425
The license, why is there
a license under my name

01:04:48.449 --> 01:04:50.601
with your picture on it?

01:04:50.625 --> 01:04:51.907
Luna, listen to me.

01:04:51.931 --> 01:04:52.714
No.

01:04:53.802 --> 01:04:55.456
You rented the fucking car.

01:04:57.067 --> 01:04:58.740
Put the lighter down.

01:04:58.764 --> 01:04:59.547

01:05:00.374 --> 01:05:01.656
You think I'm so stupid,

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.310
but I know what
you're doing, Eleni.

01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:04.920
We don't have time for this now.

01:05:04.944 --> 01:05:06.704
You thought you'd find
yourself a little girl

01:05:06.728 --> 01:05:08.271
that would do
whatever you wanted.

01:05:08.295 --> 01:05:09.969
ELENI: You always had a choice.

01:05:09.993 --> 01:05:10.883
So did you.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:11.971
Are you crazy?

01:05:11.995 --> 01:05:13.233
You called me!

01:05:13.257 --> 01:05:14.625

this house on fire

01:05:14.649 --> 01:05:17.106
with me and Armando in it.

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:18.978
You were pulling all
the strings, Eleni.

01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:19.979
So you could disappear

01:05:20.003 --> 01:05:22.092
and run away with
the money as me.

01:05:28.533 --> 01:05:29.989
