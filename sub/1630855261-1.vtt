00:05.005 --> 00:06.740
* You gotta hustle
You gotta be tough *

00:06.840 --> 00:08.076
* If your dreams
Don't scare you *

00:08.176 --> 00:09.310
* They ain't big enough *

00:09.410 --> 00:11.412
I'm Lexi.
And let's just be honest.

00:11.512 --> 00:12.946
My dating life kinda sucks.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.649
You'd think it'd be easier
dating both males and females

00:15.749 --> 00:17.485
because, you know,
more fish in the sea.

00:17.585 --> 00:18.719
But you'd be wrong.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.421
I've been talking
to two matchmakers,

00:20.521 --> 00:22.423
and I'm just ready
to put my dating life

00:22.523 --> 00:23.957
in someone else's hands.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.559
We've got this huge house.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.461
We're gonna bring
a bunch of daters here,

00:27.561 --> 00:29.530
and hopefully, I'll find love.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.634
* Ba da dum *

00:33.734 --> 00:35.369
* Now good morning *

00:35.469 --> 00:37.671
-* Ba da dum *
-* PM *

00:37.771 --> 00:39.873
-* Ba da dum *
-* You know the dealio... *

00:39.973 --> 00:41.175
-[Spicy] Hi.
-Hi.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.776
It's so nice to meet you both.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.546
Pleasure. I'm Spicy Mari.
Nice to meet you.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.281
-Hi, I'm Anthony.
-Hi.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.582
I'm Spicy Mari,

00:48.682 --> 00:50.751
relationship expert
and magnetic matchmaker.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.521
Founder of The Spicy Life
relationship consulting firm.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.424
I help people unlock
the power of their passion

00:56.524 --> 00:58.192
so that they can attract
their perfect mate.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.460
I'm Anthony Recenello,

00:59.560 --> 01:01.729
a social skills
and relationship coach.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.731
I've been doing this
for the past 15 years,

01:03.831 --> 01:06.467
I have a YouTube channel,
a podcast,

01:06.567 --> 01:08.301
all about teaching you

01:08.402 --> 01:10.538
how to get into
the right relationships.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.773
-I'm so excited.
-Pop a squat. Let's chat.

01:12.873 --> 01:13.641
Alright.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.943
So Lexi, tell us a little bit

01:16.043 --> 01:18.646
of what you're looking for
in a relationship.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.982
I'm looking for a person
who is adventurous,

01:22.082 --> 01:23.551
who likes to travel.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.353
Who is supportive of me
and my pursuits,

01:25.453 --> 01:27.420
just like I would be
supportive of them.

01:27.521 --> 01:31.359
And I'm really hoping
you guys can help me find that.

01:31.459 --> 01:34.195
I am a Hispanic,
pansexual female

01:34.295 --> 01:36.930
and I feel like I'm missing
a spark in my dating life,

01:37.030 --> 01:38.265
to be honest with you.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.269
I want to constantly wake up
and feel excited to see

01:41.369 --> 01:43.371
and be around
that special person.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.905
-Past people that you dated.
-Yeah.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.240
What were things
that you really liked?

01:46.340 --> 01:47.508
And what were things
that you go,

01:47.608 --> 01:49.042
"I don't know if I want that."

01:49.143 --> 01:52.313
I really care for a person
that's communicative.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.714
I travel often

01:53.814 --> 01:55.583
and I think
it's really important

01:55.683 --> 01:58.519
that a person that I'm with
also loves to travel.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.522
I am very spiritual,
I love to manifest.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.056
I journal every single day.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.558
It's super important to me.

02:04.658 --> 02:08.596
Also, like, loud, just, like,
big personality

02:08.696 --> 02:10.130
-Yeah.
-So, like, an extrovert.

02:10.231 --> 02:13.033
Yeah, an extrovert.
I'm very much an extrovert.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.302
I'm loving what I'm hearing.

02:14.402 --> 02:17.103
I feel like we can find
exactly this.

02:17.204 --> 02:18.639
I'm really excited to hear that.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.040
I'm really excited to hear that.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.577
What in a relationship is
really important to you?

02:23.677 --> 02:25.546
So, I would say trustworthy.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.182
-Mm. Good. Good.
-Uh, very loyal.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.917
Doesn't get jealous.

02:30.017 --> 02:32.520
-Secure.
-Secure. Very secure. Yeah.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.853
Like, what's gonna woo you?

02:33.954 --> 02:37.525
I feel like I'm honestly
very easily impressed.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.494
Like, you could write me,
like, a love letter.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.895
I love that.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.497
It doesn't have to be
anything physical either.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.233
Just, like, take me
to my favorite place

02:45.333 --> 02:46.567
-without telling me. Or...
-Yeah.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.269
Care about the things
that I tell you.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.671
It's like, "Okay, you care
about what I'm telling you."

02:50.771 --> 02:52.305
Yeah, they really pay attention.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.641
-Thoughtful.
-Thoughtful, yeah.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.476
It sounds like you need
a lot of quality time,

02:55.576 --> 02:57.010
-a lot of attention, um--
-Yes.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.079
-But it goes both ways.
-Okay. You can give it.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.749
-You can dish it. Okay.
-Yeah. I understand.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.784
Oh, and this is
another cute tidbit.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.019
When I'm taking girls out
on a date,

03:06.119 --> 03:07.421
I like to plan the date.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.690
But when it comes to guys,
I don't like doing that.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.058
I want them to do that for me.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.860
Love it. Oh, this is
going to be fun, Anthony.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.861
[laughs]

03:13.961 --> 03:15.228
[Spicy] This is going to be
so fun.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.829
After meeting both Anthony
and Mari,

03:16.930 --> 03:19.433
I am confident
that these dating coaches

03:19.533 --> 03:22.002
have what it takes
to lead me to love.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.605
So what we're gonna do
is we're going to look through

03:24.704 --> 03:26.540
a bunch of
potential matches for you,

03:26.640 --> 03:27.875
and then narrow it down.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.743
We're going to break up
into two teams, alright?

03:29.843 --> 03:32.579
Then we're going to put them
through some dating challenges,

03:32.680 --> 03:33.847
give them some dating coaching,

03:33.947 --> 03:35.683
and then find
the perfect match for you.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.552
Okay, I'm putting my trust
in both of your guys' hands,

03:38.652 --> 03:40.454
I know you guys will find
the one for me

03:40.554 --> 03:42.356
and I could not be
more excited about this.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.557
We got you.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.497
-[Anthony] Alright, Spicy.
-[Spicy] Yep.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.899
-The time is now.
-Time we've been waiting for.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.268
We're gonna choose
the matches for Lexi.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.603
Let's do it. I'm ready.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.574
[Anthony]
I mean, I love the vibes.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.744
It's--The color palette
of the photo

04:03.844 --> 04:05.779
-Yeah.
-also matches her outfit.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.282
Which is attention to detail
and I really like that.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.818
-Got good taste. Silly.
-Silly.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.421
Um, or she snuck something

04:13.521 --> 04:15.789
from her parents' bar
when she was a kid.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.725
-Not sure what I'm seeing here.
-[laughs]

04:17.825 --> 04:20.594
I think I'm gonna play this one
nice and let you have it.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.396
-and not come for you. Yeah.
-Oh okay.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.697
I'm not gonna come for you.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.836
I'm sad that I can't have you.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.806
I think that being with Anthony,
he's gonna help me.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.142
I mean, I don't know how much
matchmaking coaching

04:35.242 --> 04:36.810
I'm gonna need
'cause I'm pretty good at it,

04:36.909 --> 04:39.647
but any other help
I can get, I'll take it.

04:39.747 --> 04:40.981
[Spicy] Ooh, that's beautiful.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.916
-[Spicy] Love this photo.
-[Anthony] Great.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.353
Like, the athleticism
is important, right?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.087
So, I'm liking it so far.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.156
I'm gonna say that
I'm gonna fight you for him.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.892
-'Cause I like him. A lot.
-Is it really a fight, though,

04:51.992 --> 04:53.594
when you're going up against me?
I don't think so.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.696
-Then we'll find out.
-Okay, let's find out.

04:58.666 --> 04:59.800
-Luis.
-Yes, sir.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.369
Hi, my name's Anthony.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.837
I'm a social
and relationship coach.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.206
Luis, I teach men
how to meet women.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.076
And I teach men
how to keep women.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.379
[Luis] Eh, she's throwing shots.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.846
I'm liking Spicy right now.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.247
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to
go with Spicy.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.449
I really wanted him.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.950
-I really wanted him.
-Thanks, Spicy.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.186
So my game plan for this is
definitely go in confident

05:19.286 --> 05:20.320
I'm tryin' to have fun.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.255
If it's a fight,
I'm really competitive.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.324
So I'm going in 100% of the way.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.159
I'm not laying down any chance.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.370
[Spicy] I'm never a fan
of bathroom photos.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.038
This isn't saying
anything to me.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.940
-It just looks like a--
-Feels like a fail.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.141
[both laugh]

05:41.241 --> 05:45.078
Now I'm not sure...
what the context is here.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.914
I'm a Capricorn,
so I love the goat.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.249
-Okay.
-[laughs]

05:49.750 --> 05:51.218
[Spicy] Come hither.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.454
-Oh, I might.
-[laughs]

05:53.554 --> 05:55.989
[Kalysta] I'm usually
a chaser, like...

05:56.089 --> 06:00.093
I'm on my hands and knees
crawling, begging,

06:00.994 --> 06:02.696
"Be mine."

06:03.230 --> 06:03.997
Ooh, a vision board.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.833
Lexi's huge into manifestation.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.636
So I am liking the fact
that this person's a visionary.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.304
It's a little bit of a mess
of a vision board.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.340
It's not quite organized.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.012
I guess I'm just
too interesting for Lexi.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.648
[laughter]

06:20.748 --> 06:22.249
And washboard abs.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.784
I hate to be superficial

06:23.884 --> 06:25.986
but this is hard work
and dedication.

06:27.521 --> 06:28.556
[Anthony] Approach.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.090
[Cyprien] Team Anthony!

06:30.190 --> 06:32.760
Wait.Those are "A"s right here.
Team Anthony.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.394
-Hey, man.
-Yes.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.597
Actually, I heard you speak
French too.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.665
I do speak French.

06:37.765 --> 06:38.966
[in French] Do you speak French?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.000
[in French] Of course.
Do you speak French?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.835
No, that's all I know. [laughs]

06:41.935 --> 06:43.537
I already know. Solid team.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.338
We're definitely gonna
take home this W.

06:45.439 --> 06:46.907
Take home this girl, actually.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.978
Hi, welcome to the winning team.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.345
-Hey.
-[Spicy] Come here.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.347
What's good, y'all?
Man, you already know me.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.449
It's your boy Josh.

06:55.549 --> 06:56.950
I'ma win it.
I'ma get the girl.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.752
I'm willing to fight
to the end for who I want.

06:58.852 --> 07:03.223
I predict this experience
will be fun, crazy, chaotic,

07:03.323 --> 07:05.025
wild and interesting.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.160
I feel she's gonna be
coaching us well.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.262
We're gonna-- We're gonna win.
We're gonna do great.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.732
-[Spicy] Oh!
-Yeah, boi.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.033
Hug it out, baby.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.368
-A dagger in my heart.
-That's right.

07:15.469 --> 07:20.307
My best physical feature would
definitely be my eyebrows.

07:20.407 --> 07:23.310
Check these out. I mean...
Who can say no to these?

07:23.410 --> 07:24.277
[bell dings]

07:24.377 --> 07:25.546
[Cameron] Sorry, Spicy.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.516
-It's okay, it's okay. Call me.
-[laughs]

07:28.616 --> 07:30.551
* Oh my god who is she? *

07:30.651 --> 07:32.119
* Lookin' like money
when I step on the scene *

07:32.219 --> 07:33.587
Hi, everybody.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.523
Hi, daters.
How you guys doing today?

07:35.623 --> 07:36.657
[Anthony] So, I think we have

07:36.757 --> 07:38.592
some really good matches
for Lexi.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.427
Now it's time to move them in.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.429
[Spicy] And we've been keeping
the guys and girls separate

07:42.530 --> 07:44.231
this entire dating process

07:44.331 --> 07:45.666
and they don't know
about each other.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.534
So let's see how this goes.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.103
[Spicy]
Welcome to the house, daters.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.372
[Sienna] I don't feel, like,
competitive with girls usually.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.507
It's just kind of...

07:54.174 --> 07:55.475
I either want to be your friend

07:55.576 --> 07:57.645
and I want to,like,
understand you emotionally,

07:57.745 --> 07:59.813
or, like, I want you. [laughs]

07:59.913 --> 08:02.015
[Rylin] I'm seeing
all these attractive people

08:02.115 --> 08:03.884
walk up with me into this house.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.721
I'm so scared 'cause these are
gorgeous people

08:07.821 --> 08:11.224
and I'm already like,
"My competition is insane,

08:11.324 --> 08:12.459
through the roof."

08:12.560 --> 08:13.861
And then I see...

08:13.961 --> 08:16.964
-[girls chattering]
-What?

08:17.064 --> 08:18.098
Wait.

08:18.465 --> 08:19.900
-[all chattering]
-What?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.169
As I'm walking up,
I'm seeing girls

08:22.269 --> 08:24.371
and I'm like,
"What is going on?"

08:24.471 --> 08:26.940
Why are a bunch of dudes
walking in behind us?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.508
And why are they hot?

08:28.609 --> 08:29.977
Heya!

08:30.077 --> 08:33.113
[Spicy] Come in,
come in, come in.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.182
Lookin' delicious over here.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.183
Yes.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.885
[Brian]
We're a good looking crowd.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.419
We are stunning.

08:39.519 --> 08:47.260
I'm like, "So who's dating who?"

08:47.360 --> 08:49.529
So girls, I'm sure
you're a little surprised

08:49.630 --> 08:50.964
to see the boys here.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.601
You all know you've signed up
for a dating show

08:53.701 --> 08:55.703
and that you've been
drafted into two teams.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.938
But you're not here
to date each other.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.474
[clamoring]

09:01.575 --> 09:02.743
I'm shocked right now.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.612
I had no ideas
girls were gonna be here.

09:04.712 --> 09:05.779
I don't know what's going on.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.347
We're gonna be
putting you through

09:07.447 --> 09:08.816
a series of
dating-based challenges,

09:08.916 --> 09:12.085
giving you dating advice
and helping you win our match.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.854
So are you ready to meet them?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.222
[all] Yeah!

09:15.322 --> 09:16.990
[Spicy]
That's what I'm talking about.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.491
Come on out!

09:22.462 --> 09:23.664
Hi everyone.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.899
[cheering]

09:26.566 --> 09:28.836
Lexi walks out
and I'm like., "Wow."

09:28.936 --> 09:31.338
This is my exact type.
Thank you very much.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.406
She's gorgeous, stunning.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.809
And then she had the drip
on and she was steppin'...

09:37.044 --> 09:37.978
She bad!

09:38.078 --> 09:39.913
Hey guys, how is everyone doing?

09:40.013 --> 09:40.914
[cheering]

09:41.014 --> 09:42.449
I don't want her
to see anyone else.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.251
Like, "Me, bae. Me."

09:44.351 --> 09:45.585
Like, "It's just me."

09:45.686 --> 09:47.120
Like, "Don't worry
about all of them.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.022
They're really good looking,
I know.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.457
But you don't gotta see that."

09:50.557 --> 09:52.660
I'm so excited to see
all of you here today.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.094
I know this seems kinda crazy

09:54.194 --> 09:56.997
but I'm honestly used to dating
both guys and girls,

09:57.097 --> 09:59.165
so this is going to be
a really cool experience

09:59.266 --> 10:00.500
for me and for you guys.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.869
I'm really trying to find
my perfect match,

10:01.969 --> 10:04.204
so I figured
let's bring you all here

10:04.304 --> 10:05.272
and have some fun.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.274
[all cheering]

10:07.374 --> 10:08.976
[Sienna]
I'm extremely competitive.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.911
I have no problem
competing for someone

10:11.011 --> 10:13.714
And I know I-I always win,
always win.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.883
Every girl that
I've ever wanted, I've had

10:16.717 --> 10:18.385
That's a bold statement too.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.653
This is gonna be a wild ride.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.055
Guys, girls, did you hear that?

10:22.155 --> 10:25.525
You both have a chance
to win Lexi's heart.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.927
Hard enough fighting dudes.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.295
Now I gotta fight girls?

10:28.395 --> 10:30.530
Girls know what girls want.
How can I compete with that?

10:30.630 --> 10:31.899
But remember, as your coaches,

10:31.999 --> 10:33.834
we're gonna be helping you
and your teammates

10:33.934 --> 10:35.035
along the way.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.171
So our goal here is
to try and help one of you

10:38.271 --> 10:40.340
to be the last match standing.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.275
[all cheer]

10:42.375 --> 10:43.944
Right now I'm seeing Lexi

10:44.044 --> 10:45.779
and I want to go
to the end with this girl.

10:45.879 --> 10:49.349
There's nothing about her that
I would change. She's perfect.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.584
Please get moved in
and dress to impress,

10:51.685 --> 10:53.821
'cause we are going to be
throwing a party tonight.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.889
-Let's do this!
-[cheering]

10:55.989 --> 10:58.491
[applause]

10:58.591 --> 11:00.593
[cheering continues]

11:09.937 --> 11:15.275
Oh my god, this [bleep] house
is beautiful.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.712
I-- first of all. I feel bougie.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.981
And I'm honestly
so grateful to be here.

11:31.759 --> 11:35.495
I live in a trailer park,
so I'm like...

11:41.601 --> 11:43.270
Oh my god, its--

11:43.670 --> 11:45.072
I'm locked out!

11:45.572 --> 11:46.506
Where are you from?

11:46.606 --> 11:47.908
I'm from Santa Barbara.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.743
Where's that?

11:49.843 --> 11:51.178
You don't know
where Santa Barbara is?

11:51.278 --> 11:52.345
Nope.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.348
So right out the gates,
Tyler is trying to hit on me

11:55.448 --> 11:58.485
and I am like,
"Buddy, I'm a lesbian."

11:58.585 --> 12:00.587
And he, obviously,
is only trying harder.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.722
So you're from
somewhere Southern.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.992
-Alabama.
-Alabama?

12:05.092 --> 12:06.393
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Really?

12:06.493 --> 12:07.660
What are you doing here?

12:07.761 --> 12:08.728
Uh, social media.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.330
When it comes to my sexuality,

12:10.430 --> 12:14.902
it's probably like a 90 to 10%
ratio of liking women to men.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.837
I mean, he seems like
a good guy to be friends with,

12:16.937 --> 12:18.839
but he was kinda growing on me,
I'm not gonna lie.

12:19.306 --> 12:22.075
But, I mean--
He's a funny one. I like him.

12:27.514 --> 12:30.050
[all chattering]

12:30.550 --> 12:32.152
[Marc] I got locked out.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.954
We can watch Netflix on there.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.522
Oh my god, yes!

12:35.622 --> 12:37.357
I'm so excited.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.792
I feel like
coming to this house,

12:38.892 --> 12:41.761
I do have rules set on myself
to keep me in check

12:41.862 --> 12:46.633
because since I have dated
pretty much one type before,

12:46.733 --> 12:49.369
and that's basically people
who are very egotistical,

12:49.469 --> 12:50.838
very selfish and everything,

12:50.938 --> 12:53.573
I feel like I won't let myself

12:53.673 --> 12:56.109
get involved with that...
ever again.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.251
[Camille] The sleeping
arrangements in the house are

13:04.351 --> 13:05.785
me and Jasmine in one bed...

13:05.886 --> 13:07.354
All the guys are sleeping in
their own bed.

13:07.454 --> 13:13.326
But in the other girls' room is
Jayme, Sienna and Rylin.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.064
[Tyler] What do you think
about the house?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.431
This house is fire, man.

13:18.531 --> 13:19.833
I never been
in anything like this.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.601
Okay, cut to the chase.
What do you think about--

13:21.701 --> 13:23.336
[Josh] The girls?

13:23.436 --> 13:24.737
They all bad. I'm not gonna lie.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.107
Lil' blondie,
I think she's callin my name.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.275
Who? Which one?

13:28.375 --> 13:30.343
What's her name? Oh, uh, Sienna.

13:30.911 --> 13:31.879
Sierra.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.248
-[laughs]
-One of us wrong.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.784
Some of these girls
are catching my eye.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.419
Oh they're going to
get me in trouble.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.889
That's it. [laughs]

13:45.692 --> 13:47.394
The one in the blue top.
You know her name?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.196
-[Tyler] I forgot it.
-[Josh] Kalysta.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.563
No, no, no, no...

13:50.663 --> 13:52.165
Oh! Jayme!

13:52.565 --> 13:55.802
-[laughs] Jayme?
-I'm on all the names.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.170
At the end of the day,

13:57.270 --> 13:59.973
the ultimate goal is
obviously Lexi. You know?

14:00.073 --> 14:04.244
But I can't help
but explore the other options.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.279
I mean, it's just there.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.681
We gotta fight each other
and the girls for one girl.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.217
Yeah. For one girl.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.652
I mean, that just made it
harder, to be honest.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.621
It did make it a lot harder.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.623
You going for the one girl?
Or have some fun?

14:16.723 --> 14:18.125
That's what I gotta figure out.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.259
What are you gonna do?

14:19.392 --> 14:21.761
I don't know. I'm here
to win. Low-key, so...

14:21.861 --> 14:22.862
You not winnin',
I'm winnin'.

14:22.963 --> 14:23.931
I hate to tell you.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.698
Win or learn, never lose.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.368
I ain't never heard that before.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.869
Win or learn, never lose.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.340
-Yeah! Put my boy on!
-Mm hm.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.575
Hey, second place
looks good for you, boss.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.377
-[Tyler laughs]
-[Josh] I feel you.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.180
Let me go ahead and ask Sienna
how she feel about this.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.314
[Tyler] It's Sierra.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.582
[both snicker]

14:42.682 --> 14:45.418
-[Sienna] Wow!
-So pretty.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.187
This is so cute, isn't it?

14:47.287 --> 14:48.455
This is so cute.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.689
[Sienna] How do we claim it?

14:49.789 --> 14:51.724
-Oh yeah.
-I like the view.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.493
This is the life right here.

14:53.593 --> 14:54.861
-Yes, sir.
-Yep.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.829
-We're locked out.
-Hey, boys.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.098
-Please let us in.
-We're locked out.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.000
-Are y'all locked out?
-That sucks.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.801
-Y'all fixin' to get locked out.
-That sucks for you guys.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.137
I guess we won't see you
at the party tonight.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.272
-Yo.
-No.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.112
* It's gettin' loud
at the party *

15:12.212 --> 15:13.746
* You should come around *

15:14.081 --> 15:17.284
* I turn it all the way up
and now my body down down *

15:17.384 --> 15:19.186
[cheering]

15:19.286 --> 15:22.789
So Lexi sets up this party
for us to all meet each other,

15:22.889 --> 15:25.092
get to know each other and talk.
I was playing friendly,

15:25.192 --> 15:27.660
but I really was trying
to read everyone and be like,

15:27.760 --> 15:29.829
"You're goin' home,
you're goin' home..."

15:29.929 --> 15:31.731
[Kalysta] "You're annoying,
you're boring,

15:31.831 --> 15:33.466
you're rude, you're stuck up.

15:33.566 --> 15:34.667
Why are you here?"

15:34.767 --> 15:35.702
"Yikes."

15:35.802 --> 15:36.970
Like, I'm fun, I'm cool.

15:37.070 --> 15:40.040
But they are not giving.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.441
What'd you guys think of Lexi?

15:41.540 --> 15:43.977
-I think she's real cute.
-Not cute, she's bad.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.378
-A blonde baddy.
-She came out

15:45.478 --> 15:47.947
and first thing I thought,
I was like, "Oh yeah."

15:48.048 --> 15:50.550
It's giving like, nice, like,
nice girl, like--

15:50.650 --> 15:51.884
She's definitely
a nice girl, for sure.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.153
I just can't wait
to talk to her.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.687
-Yeah, get to know her.
-[Marc] Hey, bro.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.356
-Here for one reason.
-And one reason only.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.624
To win.

15:57.724 --> 15:58.992
-You know what I'm sayin'?
-To find love.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.061
This is the type of house.
I'd be living here.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.062
Okay.

16:03.663 --> 16:04.731
[Luis] Ooh!

16:04.831 --> 16:06.199
Damn.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.569
I am looking forward to meeting
my fellow competitors,

16:09.669 --> 16:11.038
getting to know them better.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.140
Hopefully figuring out
what they're here for

16:13.240 --> 16:14.441
and what they're intentions are.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.808
I'm on the girl's team.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.810
-Yes, ma'am.
-No, I'm on Anthony.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.079
Damn, are you
on the girl's team?

16:19.179 --> 16:20.447
[Luis] Yeah, I'm Team Spicy,
for sure.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.315
-Okay!
-Yo.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.117
[Marc] No. I'm on Anthony.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.485
Hey, guys.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.653
Hey!

16:26.753 --> 16:28.521
Y'all having
a good time, or what?

16:28.621 --> 16:29.722
[daters] Yeah!

16:29.822 --> 16:31.224
Okay, come on.
Let's come over here.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.194
We gotta chat. We gotta
fill you in on what's going on.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.097
Hey guys, how is everyone doing?

16:37.197 --> 16:37.964
Doing great.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.966
Good. I'm so glad to hear that.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.935
So, I know we all
haven't gotten the chance

16:43.036 --> 16:45.105
to get to know
each other individually yet.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.140
So I thought,
what better way to do that

16:47.240 --> 16:48.975
than to do some speed dating?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.710
-How does that sound?
-Yeah!

16:50.810 --> 16:52.045
[Lexi] Alright.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.947
I'm not even gonna lie to you.
I'm feeling so giddy right now.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.883
I'm looking at
all of these daters

16:56.983 --> 16:58.351
and I feel so lucky.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.187
And I can't wait
to get to know everyone.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.754
So, how this is gonna work is

17:01.854 --> 17:03.956
we're only gonna have
three minutes

17:04.057 --> 17:05.791
-to get to know each other.
-What?

17:05.892 --> 17:07.260
-Three minutes?
-I know, but

17:07.359 --> 17:09.096
hopefully that time
will be enough

17:09.195 --> 17:11.330
and I'm really
looking forward to this.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.099
But remember, guys,
me and Mari are here

17:13.200 --> 17:14.867
to coach you in your journey.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.002
So, we'll be
monitoring close by.

17:17.436 --> 17:20.507
So the first person I'm going
on a date with is Jayme.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.810
[applause, cheering]

17:24.676 --> 17:27.180
[Anthony] This is going to be
our first glimpse

17:27.280 --> 17:29.982
into how the daters
interact with Lexi.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.451
So, I'm really excited about it.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.654
I'm curious to see how
my team members are gonna be.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.055
Are they going to shine?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.790
Or are they gonna be a little
socially awkward?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.058
'Cause if so, I'm gonna
have to help them out.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.093
[Lexi] I like your dress.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.428
[Jayme] Thank you. I like yours.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.562
Thank you.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.565
-So how are you feeling?
-I'm feeling good.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.467
-Yeah?
-I'm a little bit nervous.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.169
But I'm really excited
about all of this.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.637
I want you to tell me
about yourself, though.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.572
Mm. I want you
to tell me about you.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.073
Okay, where do you go to school?

17:54.174 --> 17:55.842
I go to school
at American University.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.477
-So, I'm a double major.
-Okay.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.712
-Foreign Policy. D.C.
-Oh

18:00.213 --> 18:02.549
-And also Communication.
-Right.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.050
-Where do you go?
-SBCC.

18:04.151 --> 18:05.318
-Where? I don't know.
-Santa Barbara.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.387
[Lexi] First impressions,
I think she was

18:07.487 --> 18:10.490
intentionally making eye contact
with me the entire time.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.092
And I think she's very,
very, very, very beautiful.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.128
So, I'm definitely excited
to get to know her more.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.397
Sienna and I
go to... school together.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.898
I don't know
who anyone's name is.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.267
-Okay, Sienna's the blonde one.
-Okay.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.202
-We're both from Santa Barbara.
-Mm hm.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.636
But I want you to tell me
more about yourself.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.172
-I like to write music for fun.
-Oh!

18:25.272 --> 18:26.306
Yes, but I don't
do anything with it.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.007
-Oh. Why?
-'Cause, I don't know.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.342
It's just, like, a hobby.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.211
I feel like you should
do something with it.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.812
We'll see. Maybe one day.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.181
[laughs]

18:34.281 --> 18:35.182
I like it.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.117
Immediately,
Lexi and I have a spark.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.219
Jayme.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.389
Yeah, she's a good one.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.358
Thanks for asking.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.859
[Sienna] Mm hm.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.096
-Thank you.
-Why does she seem mad about it?

18:50.830 --> 18:52.031
She is funny, though.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.167
-Why are you mad about it?
-Team Anthony, bro.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.804
That's a good start
for Team Anthony right there.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.572
[Tyler]
Sienna and Jayme are talking

18:59.672 --> 19:02.842
They have definitely,
like, known each other,

19:02.942 --> 19:04.877
or they are vibing, like...

19:04.977 --> 19:07.013
Like, something's
not right there.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.148
I haven't put
my finger on it yet,

19:09.249 --> 19:16.356
but you know
I'ma figure it out.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.824
Like, what are some
of your passions?

19:17.924 --> 19:19.392
So I grew up and I did, like,

19:19.492 --> 19:21.628
soccer, softball,
musical theater...

19:21.728 --> 19:24.464
-Like, I did contortionism.
-Okay.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.466
I like circus stuff.
I wanted to join the circus.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.268
-I did aerial... silks.
-Silks?

19:28.368 --> 19:29.702
-For, like, ten years.
-Shut up.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.538
I did, like, professional.
Yeah.

19:31.638 --> 19:32.939
-That's actually so cool.
-I have them in my house.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.674
Well, you said "circus,"
I had to say...

19:34.774 --> 19:36.343
Okay, so I'm coming over.

19:36.443 --> 19:37.877
No, like, genuinely.
I'm not kidding.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.079
I'm like, okay,
so when's the first date?

19:40.179 --> 19:41.381
-Yeah.
-Okay.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.015
Now I think
the connection they're having

19:43.115 --> 19:44.284
is really good as friends,

19:44.384 --> 19:47.754
but I'm not seeing much
of an attraction right here.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.956
But I'd love to talk
to Lexi about it.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.258
Hi, nice to meet you.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.125
-What's your name. I'm sorry.
-Thank you. I'm Sienna.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.461
Sienna, I'm Lexi.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.229
-Where are you from?
-I'm from Santa Barbara.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.764
I don't like
how quiet it just got.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.599
-I know.
-It's okay, though. It's okay.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.601
-They're all low-key listening.
-They can listen to us.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.069
-We want them to.
-We're fiery.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.404
You know, they're like,
"What's going on?"

20:04.504 --> 20:05.772
-[laughs]
-They look good.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.440
-You know, but it's fine.
-You're killing me.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.541
You're from Santa Barbara.

20:08.641 --> 20:09.742
Oh, the first girl I talked to

20:09.842 --> 20:11.311
said you went
to college together.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.580
She said that?
That's so interesting.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.615
Wait. Elaborate.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.049
We didn't go to college
together.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.351
Like, okay.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.487
But we, like,
are from the same town.

20:20.587 --> 20:21.854
-Okay, no, that's what she said.
-Oh okay, okay.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.222
-I'm sorry.
-Oh no, that's so funny though.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.491
Okay, tell me more
about yourself.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.026
I, uh... I make TikToks...

20:27.126 --> 20:29.729
-I'm a singer/songwriter
-Oh my god, amazing.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.163
-How you doing?
-Good. I'm Lexi.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.932
-What's your name? Cameron.
-That's good. Cameron.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.534
-Yes.
-Tell me more about yourself.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.504
-Um, I really like snowboarding.
-Snowboarding?

20:37.604 --> 20:39.205
Yeah, that's, like,
my first hobby.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.507
-Like, I love it.
-Yeah?

20:40.607 --> 20:43.109
Um, I'm really good with kids.
I love kids.

20:43.209 --> 20:44.644
-I have a niece and nephew.
-Okay, awesome.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.245
I'm like a full-time manny
for them, so...

20:46.346 --> 20:48.381
-I have a little sister.
-Oh really? How old is she?

20:48.481 --> 20:49.849
-She's eight years old.
-Okay, okay.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.319
Yeah. Like, I want a person
that's good with kids.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.486
-You know?
-Yeah.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.621
Just 'cause
I'm around them all day.

20:54.721 --> 20:55.688
-Yeah.
-And they keep you young.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.123
That's cool. I like that.

20:57.223 --> 20:59.426
Now Cameron, to me, he holds
really good eye contact,

20:59.526 --> 21:01.661
but I want him
to be more expressive.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.796
-Okay, I have a question.
-Great. Ask me, please.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.932
How do you feel about all this?

21:06.032 --> 21:07.600
I kinda feel like you're,
like, the middle of it.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.002
-Like, attention of everything.
-Wait, that's so funny.

21:10.102 --> 21:10.970
I'm feeling--

21:11.070 --> 21:13.139
Okay, like,
a little overwhelmed

21:13.239 --> 21:15.241
but, like, for the most part,
just, like, very excited.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.509
Not nervous at all?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.144
Um... eh...

21:18.244 --> 21:19.979
-A little bit.
-A little bit. It's okay.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.381
All these people
want you, though.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.615
-So. Yeah?
-It's okay.

21:22.715 --> 21:23.983
Your name is French.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.753
Yes, I'm, like, first French
and then American.

21:26.853 --> 21:27.820
-That's amazing.
-Yeah.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.288
I, like, I'm big on traveling.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.790
I was just about to say that.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.225
-I'll take you to France, too.
-[laughs]

21:33.326 --> 21:34.427
Oh my gosh.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.895
So, my type. Honestly,

21:35.995 --> 21:38.765
Doesn't matter if you're black,
green, blue, red, white,

21:38.865 --> 21:41.501
it doesn't matter as long as
you have, like, a good face

21:41.601 --> 21:43.269
that I could stare into
for hours.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.572
That's wifey material
right there.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.239
-You're very beautiful.
-Thank you so much.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.608
-You're very, very beautiful.
-That's so sweet.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.377
I have a necklace
just like yours.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.579
-Where are you from?
-I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.681
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah, Utah boy.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.148
Wow, I've never been to Utah.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.818
Really? Okay. I go
to junior college right now.

21:58.918 --> 21:59.952
-Mm hm.
-I play basketball.

22:00.052 --> 22:00.987
And actually
just quit this year.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.489
-College basketball.
-Oh wow.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.457
Yeah, I want to focus
on, like, myself now

22:04.557 --> 22:05.858
-and kinda just do me...
-That's amazing.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.127
-No, I like that.
-And I kinda, like, fell off...

22:08.227 --> 22:10.129
-No, but, it's not falling off.
-...basketball.

22:10.229 --> 22:13.400
Like, I feel like
a lot of people lose sight

22:13.500 --> 22:15.134
of, like, what is
most important.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.103
Which is, like,
really focusing on yourself...

22:17.203 --> 22:19.606
-Yeah, no, totally, 100%.
-...what matters most to you.

22:19.706 --> 22:20.907
-I'm a hugger.
-Give me a hug.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.642
-How you doing?
-What's your name?

22:22.742 --> 22:24.010
-Tyler.
-Tyler.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.745
-I like your accent, Tyler.
-I appreciate it.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.780
-Southern born.
-I like your accent, Tyler.

22:27.880 --> 22:28.781
I'm from Alabama.
Where are you from?

22:28.881 --> 22:30.049
I'm from Florida.

22:30.149 --> 22:31.651
What are your hobbies?
Are you in school?

22:31.751 --> 22:35.087
So I went to Alabama University
for a little bit.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.657
Did a year of college
now I'm kind of just chillin'

22:37.757 --> 22:39.459
-Mm hm.
-And doin' social media.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.627
I love that.

22:40.727 --> 22:41.628
Got a marketing agency
coming out.

22:41.728 --> 22:42.862
That's awesome.

22:42.962 --> 22:43.896
Yeah. So. I'm just
kind of doing that.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.197
Are you excited about all this?

22:45.297 --> 22:46.298
How are your feelings?

22:46.399 --> 22:47.467
I'm excited to meet you.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.668
Like, you came out and I thought

22:48.768 --> 22:50.002
you looked really,
really beautiful.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.104
That's literally
the sweetest thing. Thank you.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.206
It's your smile
that, like, popped out.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.308
You're gonna make me blush.
Like, that's so nice.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.376
That's so sweet.

22:57.477 --> 22:58.711
You're also very pretty.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.680
This whole time,
I'm just looking at her eyes.

23:00.780 --> 23:04.617
She's so beautiful,
I can't, I can't look away.

23:04.717 --> 23:05.985
What do you do?
Are you in school?

23:06.085 --> 23:07.620
Do you have, like, a job?
Like, what's your...

23:07.720 --> 23:09.589
I did go to school
and everything,

23:09.689 --> 23:11.323
but since I'm very
family-oriented,

23:11.424 --> 23:12.692
I'm really close to my grandma.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.527
I decided-- She got really sick.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.829
-Oh my god.
-So, I decided to cut school

23:16.929 --> 23:18.431
and then work full time
and help out with her bills.

23:18.531 --> 23:19.932
-I'm really sorry to hear that.
-No, you're fine.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.501
-It's a lot, though.
-Yeah, it is.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.269
But it is what it is.

23:23.369 --> 23:24.704
So Jas is doing a great job

23:24.804 --> 23:26.873
of already leaning into
the emotional intimacy.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.275
She's sharing about her family,
her core values.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.844
So, tell me about yourself,
Kalysta. Oh my god.

23:33.446 --> 23:34.380
Ah, I love it.

23:34.481 --> 23:35.515
-A tooth gem.
-Thank you.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.283
-Yeah, yeah. You want one?
-I do.

23:37.383 --> 23:38.551
Alright. Got you.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.019
-[laughs]
-I'll take care of that, baby.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.221
-You're crazy. I love it.
-I'll take care of you.

23:43.089 --> 23:47.627
My ex, he would say, "Crazy
wasn't in the fine print."

23:47.727 --> 23:50.830
And I would say,
"Crazy was in bold print."

23:52.665 --> 23:54.967
-Do you like to travel?
-I love traveling.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.335
Where's your favorite
place you've been?

23:56.435 --> 23:58.004
-Guatemala.
-Guatemala?

23:58.104 --> 23:59.939
We live close to Mexico too.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.340
Yeah.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.109
-Have you ever been to Mexico?
-I've never been to Mexico.

24:03.209 --> 24:06.145
Well, Guatemala is like Mexico,
technically, I think.

24:06.245 --> 24:07.179
I don't think so.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.948
Oh, then I've
never been to Mexico.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.651
So, I don't know geography...

24:11.751 --> 24:13.853
-[laughs] That's okay.
-...that well.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.489
I have an airhead.
Oh, no.

24:16.589 --> 24:17.790
I got you this ring.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.826
-It matches your dress.
-Oh my god.

24:19.926 --> 24:22.094
-And your shoes. Yes.
-What?

24:22.194 --> 24:24.130
-you.
-I hope you love it.

24:24.230 --> 24:25.632
It's very cute.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.066
-I like this blue.
-You like the blue?

24:27.166 --> 24:28.735
You were giving,
like, Aquarius vibes.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.236
-[laughs]
-I don't know. I was like...

24:30.336 --> 24:31.604
Very sun-kissed.
Very sun-kissed...

24:31.704 --> 24:32.939
-Thank you.
-...with the freckles.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.273
No, they're fake,

24:34.373 --> 24:35.942
-They're fake?
-I shouldn't have told you that.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.777
I shouldn't have told you that.
You can't tell anyone.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.546
-It's our secret.
-It's our little secret.

24:39.646 --> 24:40.880
It's our secret.
It's our secret.

24:40.980 --> 24:41.948
They don't know
what we're talking about.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.016
And I love, like, the bi energy.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.318
-I'm fluid, pansexual, so...
-I love that.

24:46.418 --> 24:48.888
You brought together, like,
such a good group of people.

24:48.988 --> 24:52.759
No, serious.
This actually is amazing.

24:52.859 --> 24:53.993
I think Lexi's great.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.628
I think I have
a connection with her

24:55.728 --> 24:57.664
that no one in this house has.

24:57.764 --> 24:58.931
Tell me about yourself.
Where are you from?

24:59.031 --> 25:00.099
-Twenty years old.
-You're twenty years old

25:00.199 --> 25:01.300
I'm from Charlotte,
North Carolina.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.168
Oh my gosh. What?

25:02.268 --> 25:03.936
I was born in North Carolina.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.137
No, stop. What part?

25:05.237 --> 25:06.272
I tell everyone
I'm from Florida,

25:06.372 --> 25:07.607
but I was born
in North Carolina.

25:07.707 --> 25:08.841
-I go to college in Miami.
-What?!

25:08.941 --> 25:10.276
-That's crazy.
-What school?

25:10.376 --> 25:13.245
-University of Miami.
-Oh my god. I'm from Naples.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.213
[laughs]

25:14.313 --> 25:15.715
-Wait, that's crazy. Yeah.
-Wow.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.316
University of Miami is sick.

25:17.416 --> 25:18.751
-Really nice.
-What's your major?

25:18.851 --> 25:20.352
I'm Political Science
and Theater.

25:20.452 --> 25:21.988
What the [bleep]?
Are you kidding me?

25:22.088 --> 25:23.355
I'm sorry. I don't know
if I'm allowed to curse.

25:23.455 --> 25:25.391
I am a Foreign Policy
and Politics major.

25:25.491 --> 25:27.126
-No way. That's crazy.
-We have so much in common.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.494
I know that's really weird.

25:28.595 --> 25:29.962
-[laughs]
-That's funny.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.865
Lexi's already touched him,
like, ten times.

25:33.465 --> 25:34.533
He's got her.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.869
He's got her. Right now
he has her attention.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.671
Imma teach him how
to, like, seal the deal.

25:38.771 --> 25:40.339
-So how old are you?
-I'm 19.

25:40.439 --> 25:42.642
-Are you big on signs?
-Not necessarily signs.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.110
But definitely spirituality.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.477
Like manifesting.
I believe that the energy...

25:45.578 --> 25:47.279
Makes sense.
I'm really big on manifesting.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.915
Energy you put out in the world
is what you're gonna receive.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.416
Mm hm. I just started, like,

25:50.516 --> 25:52.785
trying to, like, meditate
and get right spiritually.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.153
Really? Wait, I love that.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.988
-Yeah. I took this class--
-That's big for me.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.090
-Really? Meditation?
-You should know that.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.859
-Hi. I'm Lexi.
-How you doing, Lexi?

25:59.959 --> 26:01.761
-Oh my gosh, that was so sweet.
-Nice to meet you.

26:01.861 --> 26:02.762
Give me a hug.

26:02.862 --> 26:03.930
-What's your name?
-Luis.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.665
-Luis? Yeah?
-Yeah.

26:05.765 --> 26:06.999
Um, where are you from, Luis?

26:07.099 --> 26:08.668
I'm from L.P.,
La Puente, California.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.502
I heard you're actually,
like, Hispanic.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.304
-Where are you from?
-I am. I'm from Mexico.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.706
-Mexico? Which part?
-And Spain.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.642
-Mexico City. Yeah.
-Mexico City?

26:15.742 --> 26:17.143
-I'm from Zacatecas.
-Oh my gosh.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.377
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

26:18.477 --> 26:19.411
I do speak Spanish.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.256
-So, you live in California.
-Yeah.

26:30.356 --> 26:33.092
-I'm moving here.
-That works great for me.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.661
-[laughs]
-You want to move in?

26:35.327 --> 26:37.163
Oh my gosh.
Oh, you're making me nervous.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.197
[laughs]

26:39.365 --> 26:40.132
Are you okay?

26:40.232 --> 26:42.669
[Lexi] Are you okay? [laughs]

26:42.769 --> 26:44.737
[Camille]
What an entrance to have.

26:45.137 --> 26:46.939
-[Lexi] Give me a hug.
-[Camille] Hugs?

26:47.039 --> 26:48.675
-What's your name?
-Cami.

26:48.775 --> 26:49.809
You're so pretty. How are you?

26:49.909 --> 26:51.243
Thank you. I'm good.
How are you?

26:51.343 --> 26:52.544
-Everyone has a drink.
-You should get one.

26:52.645 --> 26:55.147
-Oh my god.
-It's okay. Everything's fine.

26:55.247 --> 26:55.915
[laughs]

26:56.015 --> 27:00.319
[silent laughter]

27:00.419 --> 27:01.821
[gasps] I'm sorry.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.022
Hm.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.657
Okay. Tell me your name
one more time.

27:04.757 --> 27:06.025
-Cami.
-Cami.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.094
I love every kind of music.
Do you like music?

27:08.194 --> 27:09.962
I love music.
Who's your favorite artist?

27:10.062 --> 27:10.963
It depends.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.865
If I'm in my car, YoungBoy.

27:12.965 --> 27:13.966
I'm one of those girls.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.034
No, but, like, I like that.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.468
Okay. You do? Okay.

27:16.568 --> 27:19.171
-I could rock to NLE Choppa.
-And then if I'm vibing?

27:19.271 --> 27:20.606
-Yeah, right?
-[both laughing]

27:20.707 --> 27:23.209
Like, anybody
who can listen to it. I love it.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.644
I really, really am attracted
to people that are creative.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.514
Like, off rip, if you're
someone that plays music,

27:28.614 --> 27:31.784
writes music, loves music,
loves to paint, draw...

27:31.884 --> 27:34.486
Fashion, clothes, thrifting,
like, anything that's creative,

27:34.586 --> 27:36.222
like, I'm just ten times
more drawn to you.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.024
So I definitely look
for more creative people.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.792
-[Spicy] Ladies!
-Yes.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.761
Okay, I hate to break up
this love fest.

27:41.861 --> 27:42.862
That's okay.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.197
It's time for us
to talk to you, Lexi,

27:45.297 --> 27:46.966
and pick your brain
about the experience.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.067
-[Camille] So, I'm getting up.
-Yes.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.468
-Alright.
-Bye, love.

27:49.568 --> 27:50.703
Great job, though.
I have some tips for you, boo.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.406
-Let's deliberate.
-[Lexi] Guys, that was so fun.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.308
-Did you have a good time?
-That was really fun.

27:56.408 --> 27:57.944
That was really
a cool experience.

27:58.044 --> 28:00.079
Yeah, I want to know
who your favorites are.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.613
-Okay. So.
-Give us, like, top contenders.

28:01.714 --> 28:04.050
I would have to say, for girls,

28:04.150 --> 28:06.652
um, the first girl
I talked to, Jayme.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.687
-Yes. And I knew it.
-I felt instant connection.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.322
-As soon as I saw it.
-Like, genuinely, like...

28:10.422 --> 28:12.458
eyes weren't leaving each other.

28:12.558 --> 28:15.995
The other girl I enjoyed
talking to a lot is Camille,

28:16.095 --> 28:18.230
who is the last girl
I was just talking to.

28:18.330 --> 28:21.968
She had a great energy.
We had a lot in common.

28:22.068 --> 28:24.536
There was one girl
in a really pretty dress.

28:24.636 --> 28:27.940
-Her name was Kalysta, I think.
-[Spicy] Yeah, Kalysta.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.641
And she is definitely out there.

28:29.742 --> 28:32.044
I was trying to watch your guys'
energy and it looked...

28:32.144 --> 28:33.245
-I couldn't match it.
-Yeah.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.915
It looked as if she was
like, raarrr...

28:36.015 --> 28:37.016
Which is okay.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.118
In terms of men...

28:39.218 --> 28:42.354
um, I enjoyed talking to Joshua.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.991
-Joshua was really cool.
-I saw all smiles with Joshua.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.358
Yeah. 'Cause I've seen him.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.260
You touched him
probably, like, five times.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.629
Okay, you know what?
We're not gonna talk about that.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.299
The other guy I liked
talking to a lot was Brian.

28:53.399 --> 28:56.268
He, um, he talked to me
about his sexuality,

28:56.368 --> 28:59.305
and he told me how proud he is
of me for doing this

28:59.405 --> 29:01.607
and bridging the gap,
or whatever.

29:01.707 --> 29:03.142
But he was really cool.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.811
-Did you find him attractive?
-I do find him attractive.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.612
So do you have a good idea

29:06.712 --> 29:08.647
of who you want to bring
to the next level?

29:08.747 --> 29:09.849
I think I do.

29:09.949 --> 29:10.883
-Hm.
-I think I do.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.051
I need your guys' help.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.285
-We got you. We got you.
-Of course.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.321
I'm really excited. I really am.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.823
Totally just have
a good time with it.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.224
-Thank you.
-At the end of the day,

29:18.324 --> 29:19.859
let's find out who's going to be
an awesome friend,

29:19.959 --> 29:21.760
then we start thinking about,
like, an awesome lover.

29:21.861 --> 29:22.929
Yeah.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.897
-This is just the beginning.
-I know.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.132
-This is your first day.
-I know.

29:26.232 --> 29:27.867
Because all these
first impressions,

29:27.967 --> 29:29.068
that's all they're
supposed to be.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.169
-I know.
-First impressions.

29:30.636 --> 29:33.172
As the days go on, you're gonna
make more connections.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.340
They're gonna get deeper.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.975
You're going to probably even

29:36.075 --> 29:37.343
change your mind
about some people...

29:37.443 --> 29:38.845
-I know.
-...as you go along.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.412
-As more of a build.
-You're right.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.181
Well, I'm so glad
we got to have this talk.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.115
-Cool.
-Let's head inside.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.050
-Yeah.
-Perfect.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.251
Alright.

29:50.422 --> 29:55.361
So, we all know a big part
of dating is break-ups.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.528
[fake whimpering]

29:56.628 --> 29:58.664
Which is why
at the end of each day

29:58.764 --> 30:00.599
there's going to be
an elimination ceremony

30:00.699 --> 30:02.734
where you run the risk
of getting unmatched

30:02.835 --> 30:04.103
and getting sent home.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.372
-[daters] Ooh.
-[Spicy] Unh huh, unh huh.

30:06.472 --> 30:07.706
Get scared.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.808
My relationship so far
in connection with Lexi,

30:09.909 --> 30:12.078
I think that we've
hit it off very well.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.580
And honestly,
I'm not too worried

30:14.680 --> 30:15.747
about getting eliminated
tonight.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.850
On the screen
in front of you all,

30:17.950 --> 30:20.552
are going to appear
your dating profiles.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.255
If you see a heart,
that means you're safe.

30:23.355 --> 30:24.590
But if you see an X,

30:24.690 --> 30:26.625
that means you are
at risk of going home.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.494
But if you make
that bottom list,

30:28.594 --> 30:29.661
that chopping block list,

30:29.761 --> 30:30.897
we're gonna try to help out

30:30.997 --> 30:32.398
as much as possible
to keep you here.

30:32.498 --> 30:35.301
Don't worry guys, we're not
your coaches for nothin'.

30:35.401 --> 30:38.304
-[daters cheer]
-Thank you.

30:38.404 --> 30:39.638
We got you.

30:40.106 --> 30:42.508
[Lexi] From there,
I will be making my decisions

30:42.608 --> 30:46.378
on who is staying and who,
unfortunately, has to go home.

30:46.778 --> 30:49.515
I know we got a chance to mingle

30:49.615 --> 30:51.317
and talk to each other
one-on-one.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.685
But I know you guys also
got to talk to each other

30:53.785 --> 30:55.021
throughout the day as well.

30:55.321 --> 30:58.390
So, I wanna know what some
of your first impressions are

30:58.490 --> 30:59.691
with each other.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.193
[Lexi] So I have some questions
for you guys.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.595
The first question
I want to ask you all is

31:03.695 --> 31:07.900
who do you think could possibly
be here for the wrong reasons?

31:08.134 --> 31:10.136
Anyone can answer,
anyone can answer.

31:10.469 --> 31:11.370
[male] Ooh.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.340
[Spicy] Come on. She wants
someone that's real.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.275
Let's keep it 100. Come on.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.476
Dish it.

31:17.576 --> 31:18.844
Hey Tyler, it's on you, bro.

31:18.945 --> 31:20.246
Tyler, it's on you.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.414
-Why do y'all want me to answer?
-Come on, Tyler.

31:22.514 --> 31:23.749
-You're bold.
-Alright, bet.

31:23.849 --> 31:25.584
-Brian.
-[Brian] Brian?

31:25.684 --> 31:26.785
-Ooh.
-[Brian] Who's Brian?

31:26.885 --> 31:27.853
-Who's Brian?
-Oh, wait.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.255
-[laughter]
-Where's Brian?

31:29.355 --> 31:30.622
[Brian] Where's Brian?

31:30.722 --> 31:31.723
That's gotta be
your name, right?

31:31.823 --> 31:32.959
-Yeah, that's my name.
-Okay.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.460
He had me thinking
it wasn't his name.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.627
Why do you think that?

31:35.727 --> 31:36.795
I don't know.

31:37.163 --> 31:39.231
I just got the vibe
when I met him, to be honest.

31:39.331 --> 31:40.832
-Mm.
-Ooh.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.268
[Josh]
Man, we in the elimination...

31:42.368 --> 31:45.104
It is crazy. Like, somebody
really gotta go home.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.339
It's the first day
and somebody already going home.

31:47.439 --> 31:50.309
I don't know. I just feel like
his intentions are elsewhere.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.079
[Lexi] Okay. Um...

31:53.179 --> 31:54.846
Sounds like
they're intimidated by him.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.882
-Yeah.
-Brian, watch your back.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.084
They're intimidated by you.

31:58.184 --> 31:59.986
So, I do have
another question, guys.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.921
Um, have you guys observed
any red flags

32:03.022 --> 32:04.590
in your fellow contestants?

32:04.690 --> 32:06.125
Yeah.

32:06.825 --> 32:08.194
Dish it. What is it?

32:09.128 --> 32:10.229
Um...

32:10.829 --> 32:12.698
[Camille] Don't start drama.

32:12.798 --> 32:14.200
Cami!

32:14.300 --> 32:15.567
Don't start drama!

32:15.667 --> 32:19.138
Some of us have just came
in here with, you know, a past.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.172
That's all.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.174
[Camille] Yeah.
That's all I'll say.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.709
-[Lexi] I wanna know more.
-[Spicy] Yeah.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.677
Come on,
you gotta spill the tea.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.213
No. I'm good, guys.

32:27.313 --> 32:28.347
What's going on?

32:28.447 --> 32:30.082
We got some toxic stuff
going on over here.

32:30.182 --> 32:31.617
I want to know what's going on.

32:31.717 --> 32:32.884
-Ooh.
-Crickets.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.153
[Spicy] We're gonna find out.

32:34.253 --> 32:35.521
I bet you
we're going to find out later.

32:35.621 --> 32:36.555
-I think we are.
-The plot thickens.

32:36.922 --> 32:38.457
[Anthony] Remember,
you're here for Lexi.

32:38.557 --> 32:42.094
So, everyone. I think I'm ready
to make some decisions.

32:42.194 --> 32:45.031
So, the first person I want
to talk about is Joshua.

32:45.397 --> 32:48.334
Um, Joshua,
I had a really good time

32:48.434 --> 32:50.036
speaking with you today.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.538
I think our three-minute date
went really well.

32:52.638 --> 32:53.839
We have a lot in common.

32:53.939 --> 32:56.042
-Um, like a lot in common.
-A lot.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.109
Which I thought
was really exciting.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.810
So, you are still a match.

32:58.910 --> 33:02.081
[cheering and applause]

33:03.749 --> 33:05.784
Our conversation
was really good.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.553
She wanted to talk
to your boy some more,

33:07.653 --> 33:08.687
you know what I'm sayin'?

33:08.787 --> 33:10.256
Peep the swag I had.

33:10.356 --> 33:13.092
So, we fixin' to chop it up
some more and see what I can do.

33:13.192 --> 33:15.961
The next person that I want
to talk about is Luis.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.397
So I had a really great time
talking with you tonight.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.600
There were a couple things
I noticed that I didn't like.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.570
I thought it was
just a little awkward

33:24.670 --> 33:26.805
when you kissed me on the hand.

33:26.905 --> 33:28.240
Um, I don't know.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.542
I just thought it was,
like, a weird introduction.

33:30.642 --> 33:34.880
So for those reasons, Luis,
tonight you are going to be

33:34.980 --> 33:36.848
on the chopping block,
unfortunately.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.784
-Dang.
-Dude.

33:38.884 --> 33:40.119
Aw.

33:40.952 --> 33:42.521
My date was not that bad.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.523
I'm pretty sure somebody else
had to screw up more than me.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.093
The next person I want
to talk about is Kalysta.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.727
So, I had a really great time

33:48.827 --> 33:50.562
talking with you
tonight, Kalysta.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.098
I did feel
a little bit concerned

33:52.198 --> 33:53.699
that some of our conversations

33:53.799 --> 33:55.634
were a little bit
on the surface level.

33:55.734 --> 33:56.902
And because of that,

33:57.002 --> 33:58.036
I just really want
to get to know you more

33:58.137 --> 33:59.638
because I thought
we really vibed.

33:59.738 --> 34:02.241
It was hard for me to remember,
like, certain things about you.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.076
Maybe 'cause I was just, like,
staring at your eyes too much.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.212
But, I do want
to get to know you better.

34:06.312 --> 34:07.913
Um, and so for that reason,

34:08.013 --> 34:10.149
I'm going to be
keeping you as a match.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.083
[Kalysta] Thank you.

34:15.521 --> 34:18.456
The next person I would like
to address is Jayme.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.891
Um, Jayme, you were probably
my favorite person

34:20.992 --> 34:22.094
that I talked to tonight.

34:22.194 --> 34:24.029
Sorry to be very candid
with everyone.

34:24.130 --> 34:27.599
Um, I really, really enjoyed
talking to you.

34:27.699 --> 34:28.934
You are a lovely person

34:29.034 --> 34:31.203
and I'm very excited
to get to know you more.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.472
Because of that,
I'm keeping you as a match.

34:34.206 --> 34:37.007
[applause, soft cheers]

34:38.177 --> 34:39.378
And the last person I would like

34:39.478 --> 34:41.246
to talk about tonight
is Cameron.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.349
Cameron, I really loved
talking to you tonight,

34:43.449 --> 34:45.217
but I want to know
more about you

34:45.317 --> 34:48.154
and I thought that
a lot of the conversation,

34:48.254 --> 34:50.589
like, it just, some of
it didn't flow very well.

34:50.688 --> 34:53.725
And, because of that,
tonight you are going to be

34:53.824 --> 34:55.860
on the chopping block,
unfortunately.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.596
[Spicy sighs] Whoo.

34:57.696 --> 34:58.730
You should have chose my team.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.199
[daters mutter softly]

35:00.299 --> 35:03.135
So, can I please have Luis
and Cameron step forward.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.305
I'm going to be talking
to my dating coaches.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.774
They will be helping me
make my final decision tonight.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.209
So, I will be back
in a little bit,

35:10.309 --> 35:12.144
and we will see
who's going home.

35:13.845 --> 35:16.682
[quiet conversation]

35:17.683 --> 35:20.719
Guys, I have a really difficult
decision to make tonight.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.488
-It's what we're here for.
-Yeah.

35:22.588 --> 35:23.755
Let me tell you right now,

35:24.423 --> 35:27.259
it would be a smart decision
to keep Luis. Okay?

35:27.626 --> 35:30.061
He may have came on
a little bit strong

35:30.162 --> 35:31.597
when it came to,
like, touching you.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.031
It was kinda corny.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.601
But I can tell that
there's, like, romance at heart.

35:35.701 --> 35:36.768
He's gonna court you.

35:37.002 --> 35:38.570
He's gonna woo you,
knock you off your feet.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.840
And you wanted someone who was
gonna, like, plan dates for you,

35:41.940 --> 35:43.175
and he totally seems like

35:43.275 --> 35:44.710
someone you were
hitting it off with,

35:44.810 --> 35:47.078
as far as, like, you guys
were speaking Spanish together.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.014
It was, like, really sexy
and romantic.

35:49.114 --> 35:51.917
Like, I can see that there was
some type of connection.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.186
We gotta give it
a little bit more massaging.

35:54.286 --> 35:58.023
Honestly, you know, I saw
a lot of performance from Luis.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.291
-Mm.
-The whole kissing thing,

35:59.391 --> 36:01.693
I don't know.
It was kinda cheesy to me.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.629
I like Cameron a lot.

36:03.729 --> 36:06.998
And I get that he wasn't
that expressive with you,

36:07.098 --> 36:08.300
[Spicy] Or charismatic at all.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.101
His vibe, to me at least,

36:10.202 --> 36:12.538
he was really chill,
he was really relaxed,

36:12.638 --> 36:14.273
and he, to me at least,

36:14.373 --> 36:16.542
it looked like he was
really interested in you.

36:16.642 --> 36:20.512
He wasn't trying to perform,
to do all of this big stuff.

36:20.612 --> 36:23.081
-He wasn't trying at all.
-He wanted to interact with you.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.551
I'm gonna have
to disagree on this.

36:25.651 --> 36:28.987
Like, I feel like
Cameron was extremely bland.

36:29.087 --> 36:31.056
-Yeah.
-He did not, like, step up.

36:31.156 --> 36:32.691
This is the difference
between you and me.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.826
-You want the big performance.
-So does Lexi.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.094
I care about the connection.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.763
[Spicy] Lexi wants
the big performance too.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.932
She wants to know that
you are the apple of her eye.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.268
And he was--

36:42.368 --> 36:44.069
I don't know what
"apple of her eye" means.

36:44.169 --> 36:45.704
[overlapping speech]

36:45.804 --> 36:47.105
I think you guys both make,

36:47.205 --> 36:49.341
like, a lot of good points,
genuinely.

36:49.441 --> 36:50.742
And this is a really difficult
decision for me,

36:50.842 --> 36:53.412
but I do think I know
in my heart what's right.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.213
And I think
I've made the decision.

36:55.314 --> 36:56.582
-Alright.
-Got it.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.384
-When you know, you know.
-[Anthony] Alright.

36:58.484 --> 37:00.486
-Let's go break the news.
-Let's get back over there.

37:00.586 --> 37:01.653
[Lexi] Yeah.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.494
My amazing dating coaches,

37:08.594 --> 37:10.696
they both gave me
some really good advice

37:10.796 --> 37:12.197
and some good insight.

37:12.298 --> 37:15.301
But, unfortunately, I did
have to come to a decision.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.102
And I think I'm going to have to

37:17.202 --> 37:18.804
go on my gut feeling
with this one.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.071
And send home the person

37:20.171 --> 37:22.441
that I felt less
of a connection with.

37:23.309 --> 37:24.543
And because of that...

37:29.881 --> 37:32.984
I'm sorry, Cameron,
but you've been unmatched.

37:33.552 --> 37:36.422
And I'm really sorry.
Please give me a big hug.

37:36.522 --> 37:37.423
You're awesome.

37:37.523 --> 37:40.125
[Camille] You make me so sad.
No.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.761
[Cameron] Alright. Peace out.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.096
-Aw.
-Oh my god.

37:45.196 --> 37:46.665
[girl] This is so sad.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.535
-[girl] So good to meet you.
-[Cameron] Yep.

37:50.201 --> 37:51.102
[Cameron] Alright.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.471
See you guys later.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.873
[all] Bye.

37:55.307 --> 37:58.377
This sucks that I'm going home.
This house is huge.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.979
Lexi's hot. There's food here.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.548
But, see ya.

38:02.648 --> 38:05.050
So I hope you guys all had
a really good time today.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.385
That was emotional,

38:06.752 --> 38:09.120
but I'm really looking forward
to getting to know all of you

38:09.220 --> 38:10.556
throughout this process.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.258
And I hope you have
a great night and sleep well.

38:13.359 --> 38:14.192
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.894
See you guys tomorrow.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.095
That was fab.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.666
I think this experience is going
to be once in a lifetime for me.

38:20.766 --> 38:23.335
Not only am I going to learn
a lot about myself,

38:23.435 --> 38:24.736
I potentially will find love.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.406
And I think, just,
it's going to be a lot for me.

38:27.506 --> 38:28.907
I don't know what to expect.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.310
[Lexi] I am really excited

38:32.411 --> 38:35.681
because today we're doing
our first challenge.

38:35.781 --> 38:36.682
[screams] Whoa!

38:37.215 --> 38:38.984
[cheering]

38:39.718 --> 38:41.887
I'm carrying the team.
It's bitches standing behind me.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.188
"Oh, I don't want to get wet."

38:43.288 --> 38:45.323
Get in the ice! Get in the ice!

38:45.424 --> 38:49.027
Luis is acting
so [bleep] fugaze.

38:49.127 --> 38:50.362
The same [bleep]
he's pulling on Lexi,

38:50.462 --> 38:51.730
he did [bleep] to Jasmine.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.965
And he did the same
[bleep] thing to Rylin.

38:54.065 --> 38:55.667
You're a rook. You're learning.

38:55.767 --> 38:56.535
[Luis] That's all bad.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.437
I've heard of love triangles,

38:58.537 --> 39:00.271
but I might be in a bit
of a love diamond.

39:00.372 --> 39:02.741
[Jayme] We were never official.
We never...

39:03.141 --> 39:04.576
She was never my girlfriend.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.044
So she's my friend.

39:06.311 --> 39:08.346
[Sienna] Mm.
