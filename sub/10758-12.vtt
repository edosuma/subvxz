WEBVTT

00:08.138 --> 00:10.600
Go ahead, Sophie, I'm listening.

00:10.766 --> 00:12.310
<i>Hi, Dr. Crane.</i>

00:12.518 --> 00:14.270
<i>My husband's having
some of his friends over</i>

00:14.437 --> 00:15.771
<i>to watch the game on Sunday,</i>

00:15.938 --> 00:19.400
<i>and I think it'd be nice if some
of my girlfriends could come over too.</i>

00:19.567 --> 00:21.527
<i>- Sounds reasonable.
- Exactly.</i>

00:21.694 --> 00:22.987
<i>I mean, it's just football.</i>

00:23.154 --> 00:27.033
<i>Not football, Einstein.
The Super Bowl.</i>

00:27.783 --> 00:29.785
That would be
your doting husband now.

00:29.952 --> 00:34.999
<i>Larry, this is a private conversation.
And for God's sakes, use a plate.</i>

00:36.042 --> 00:38.085
Sophie, why don't you put
your husband on the line?

00:38.252 --> 00:41.297
<i>- Pick up.
- Jeez. Hello?</i>

00:41.464 --> 00:45.926
Larry, I gotta tell you, I'm afraid
I side with your wife on this one.

00:46.093 --> 00:48.637
<i>That just proves you don't know
the first thing about football.</i>

00:48.804 --> 00:50.639
What I do or do not know
about football has...

00:50.806 --> 00:53.350
<i>Okay, how's this?
My wife's friends can come over</i>

00:53.517 --> 00:56.353
<i>if you can answer
even one little football question. Like...</i>

00:56.520 --> 00:57.646
I don't see that's necess...

00:57.813 --> 00:59.565
<i>You're down by six.
You're on your own 40.</i>

00:59.732 --> 01:01.150
<i>Three seconds left.
What do you do?</i>

01:01.317 --> 01:04.486
Well, all right. You would...

01:05.738 --> 01:08.824
You would take your receivers

01:10.492 --> 01:12.202
and line them up

01:12.870 --> 01:14.663
and then throw a pass.

01:14.872 --> 01:16.457
A long, long pass.

01:16.623 --> 01:18.500
<i>Yeah, and what's the name
for that?</i>

01:22.212 --> 01:24.173
A Hail Mary.

01:24.923 --> 01:27.342
Sophie and Larry,
I hope you enjoy the game.

01:27.551 --> 01:33.307
In the meanwhile, this is
Coach Crane saying, I'm listening.

01:34.474 --> 01:36.310
I'm impressed.
You're so good at charades.

01:36.476 --> 01:39.563
I'm impressed
you could mime a virgin.

01:42.149 --> 01:43.942
So, Roz, are you walking out?

01:44.109 --> 01:47.195
No, I got stuff to do.
I've got some cards to rack

01:47.362 --> 01:49.781
and I wanna put together
some Best of Crane tapes.

01:49.990 --> 01:52.492
- Oh, your mother's still in town?
- In town, in my apartment.

01:52.659 --> 01:55.370
And when I left this morning,
in my refrigerator, smelling my milk.

01:55.537 --> 01:57.122
- Oh, Lord.
- I love her,

01:57.289 --> 01:59.791
I just wish I could get a couple of hours
to myself one night.

01:59.958 --> 02:01.501
You know,
why don't you just ask her?

02:01.668 --> 02:04.212
She might enjoy a little time to herself.
I know my dad does.

02:04.421 --> 02:08.383
You are so lucky.
I wish my mother drank alone.

02:10.217 --> 02:13.972
You know, Roz, your mom's about
the same age as my dad, isn't she?

02:14.139 --> 02:16.683
- Yeah, I guess.
- Does she date much?

02:16.891 --> 02:19.644
Since my father left?
Practically never. No, hang on.

02:19.811 --> 02:21.229
No, no, hear me out, Roz.

02:21.396 --> 02:24.065
Now, Dad hasn't dated anybody
since he and Sherry broke up.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.067
I'm starting to worry
he's lost his nerve.

02:26.276 --> 02:29.320
A date with your mom
could be a tremendous favour to him.

02:29.529 --> 02:31.781
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, I'll tell you what.

02:31.990 --> 02:33.533
It's awkward,
but we can minimise that.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.243
Niles and I are having dinner
with him.

02:35.410 --> 02:37.495
We'll take him to McGinty's,
he'll feel comfortable.

02:37.662 --> 02:39.080
You and your mom
can just happen by.

02:39.247 --> 02:42.083
We'll see what transpires.
They'll never even know it's a fix-up.

02:42.292 --> 02:44.210
Oh, what the hell.
I'll give it a shot, I guess.

02:44.377 --> 02:45.920
- Okay.
- How does 5 sound?

02:46.129 --> 02:48.965
Five? Your mother's ready
for dinner at 5?

02:49.173 --> 02:52.176
I keep her on Wisconsin time.
That way, she's in bed by 8.

03:00.351 --> 03:04.105
Hey, look what I got here, boys.
A Funyun Onion.

03:04.272 --> 03:06.399
The chef sent it over
with his compliments.

03:06.858 --> 03:09.444
I wonder what his insults are like.

03:09.652 --> 03:12.071
- Hey, Bonnie.
- Hey, Marty.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.031
- Oh, you must be Frasier,
- Why, yes.

03:14.198 --> 03:15.616
- The big radio star.
- Hello.

03:15.783 --> 03:18.161
- Your dad is so proud of you.
- Oh, Dad.

03:18.327 --> 03:22.748
He talks about you all the time.
Who's your friend?

03:23.791 --> 03:26.669
Now, what's wrong with you?
I told you about my other son.

03:26.877 --> 03:31.007
Oh, of course. What am I thinking?
Nice to meet you, Eddie.

03:33.384 --> 03:35.261
This is Niles.
How about some beers, Bonnie?

03:35.428 --> 03:36.512
Coming right up.

03:39.056 --> 03:40.266
- Oh, God.
- What?

03:40.474 --> 03:43.936
The group coming in the door.
They're from the Shangri-La.

03:44.145 --> 03:46.814
- Whoa, it's the Coyote! Hey!
- Yes, hello.

03:46.981 --> 03:49.900
Evening, evening, Jimbo.
Check you later.

03:52.361 --> 03:54.155
Wow, you got a nickname
down there already.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.198
- That's great. The Coyote?
- Yes, yes.

03:56.407 --> 03:59.034
And how did you earn
that honorific?

03:59.243 --> 04:01.161
It was quite the merry road, yes.

04:01.328 --> 04:05.541
It evolved from Niles to Nilesy
to Niley to Nile E. Coyote

04:05.708 --> 04:08.085
and now, simply, the Coyote.

04:11.672 --> 04:15.467
Well, just when I thought it couldn't
be refined any further.

04:16.760 --> 04:20.430
Goodness, look who's here.
Roz!

04:20.596 --> 04:23.225
What? We don't see enough
of each other during the day?

04:23.392 --> 04:25.769
Isn't this amazing?

04:25.978 --> 04:27.521
Hello, Joanna.

04:27.729 --> 04:30.607
- It's nice to see you again, Frasier.
- Nice to see you again too.

04:30.816 --> 04:32.359
Please, won't you sit down
and join us?

04:32.526 --> 04:34.027
Oh, no, no, we don't want to intrude.

04:34.194 --> 04:36.697
Oh, no, no, no, please, please, please,
the more the merrier.

04:36.864 --> 04:39.616
All right. Mom, this is Frasier's dad,
Martin Crane.

04:39.783 --> 04:42.369
- This is my mother, Joanna Doyle.
- Very nice to meet you.

04:42.536 --> 04:44.579
- And this is my other son, Niles.
- How do you do?

04:44.746 --> 04:46.081
- It's a pleasure.
- Likewise.

04:46.248 --> 04:49.584
Roz, would you just look
at the two of them?

04:49.751 --> 04:51.545
How did you two manage
to finish all that?

04:51.712 --> 04:55.215
Oh, please, this is how
our generation ate every day.

04:55.424 --> 04:59.553
I used to live on cigarettes, whisky
sours and bacon cheeseburgers.

05:00.137 --> 05:01.721
Yeah, and what about breakfast?

05:01.888 --> 05:04.099
Fried eggs, sausage patties,
hash browns.

05:04.266 --> 05:06.560
My God. Last night,
I ate a profiterole

05:06.726 --> 05:09.020
and lay awake till dawn,
waiting for my heart attack.

05:10.981 --> 05:12.983
Those were simpler times,
weren't they, Marty?

05:13.149 --> 05:16.528
Oh, yeah, we didn't worry
about dumb things like cholesterol.

05:16.695 --> 05:18.488
We worried about putting food
on the table,

05:18.655 --> 05:21.032
keeping the yard clean
and the car shiny.

05:21.199 --> 05:24.786
- And the H-bomb.
- Well, yeah, right.

05:24.953 --> 05:28.289
Say, Roz, we better get going if
we're gonna get our work done tonight.

05:28.498 --> 05:29.791
Oh, I should be running too.

05:29.999 --> 05:32.377
But Mom and I are going
to that jazz club on 5th.

05:32.544 --> 05:35.380
But we promised
to finish those promos tonight.

05:35.547 --> 05:36.881
Oh, right.

05:37.048 --> 05:39.843
- Mom, I'm sorry. I totally forgot.
- It's okay.

05:40.009 --> 05:44.806
Wait, I've got an idea.
Dad, since I'm kidnapping Roz,

05:44.973 --> 05:46.683
why don't you take Joanna
to the jazz club?

05:46.891 --> 05:48.184
Well, sure, I'd love to.

05:48.393 --> 05:51.187
- Is that okay with you, Mom?
- If Martin's game, I'm game.

05:51.396 --> 05:52.564
- Oh, well, perfect.
- Great.

05:52.730 --> 05:55.024
Okay, you kids
just have some coffee.

05:55.191 --> 05:57.402
We'll see you back
at the apartment later, okay?

05:57.568 --> 05:58.611
All right, all right.

05:58.778 --> 06:02.281
- It was very, very nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

06:02.490 --> 06:05.535
Look at them. They think
we don't know this is a setup.

06:05.702 --> 06:07.203
Well, how could we figure it out?

06:07.370 --> 06:10.832
We're just a retired detective
and an attorney general.

06:11.958 --> 06:14.168
You were absolutely right.
They didn't suspect a thing.

06:14.335 --> 06:16.504
I told you, Roz,
just leave it to the master.

06:19.090 --> 06:21.676
God, I thought
they'd be home by now.

06:21.843 --> 06:26.097
Roz, would you please relax
and watch the pageant with us?

06:26.305 --> 06:28.516
They're right in the middle
of the talent competition.

06:28.724 --> 06:31.936
It's shameless the way they're sucking
up to the international panel of judges.

06:32.103 --> 06:36.107
Miss Germany just played
"Lady of Spain" on her French horn.

06:36.315 --> 06:38.734
At least it wasn't half as bad
as that tone-deaf performance

06:38.901 --> 06:41.821
by the aptly named Miss Singapore.

06:45.366 --> 06:47.451
Roz, you're gonna chew
that nail right off. Stop it.

06:47.618 --> 06:50.871
I can't help it. I'm nervous.
Do you think it's gonna turn out okay?

06:51.038 --> 06:52.748
- Who cares?
- Not for Miss Brazil.

06:52.957 --> 06:56.418
Look at the tree trunks on her.
She's her own little rainforest.

06:59.213 --> 07:01.549
I just keep worrying that
she's gonna have a lousy time

07:01.715 --> 07:04.760
and it'll be all my fault.
Screwing up, like always.

07:04.969 --> 07:07.471
Oh, come on, Roz, your mother
doesn't think you're a screw-up.

07:07.638 --> 07:11.892
Yeah? In high school,
I ran my own informal shoplifting clinic.

07:12.059 --> 07:13.602
In college, I dropped out of pre-law

07:13.769 --> 07:17.648
because it interfered with
Bruce Springsteen's touring schedule.

07:17.815 --> 07:19.900
And now,
I am currently an unwed mother.

07:20.067 --> 07:21.777
- What would you call me?
- Tramp.

07:22.277 --> 07:23.320
Daphne!

07:24.655 --> 07:26.240
It's Miss Venezuela.

07:26.448 --> 07:30.494
If that dress of hers was slit
any higher, you could see Caracas.

07:31.870 --> 07:34.498
Oh, Roz, you know what?
So what if they don't get along?

07:34.665 --> 07:36.500
I mean, my God,
so we made a mistake.

07:36.708 --> 07:39.002
You don't understand.
My mother doesn't make mistakes.

07:39.211 --> 07:43.257
She does everything well.
She's smart, successful, classy.

07:43.423 --> 07:45.842
Oh, what the hell was I thinking?

07:46.426 --> 07:49.429
About what?
Setting her up with my father?

07:49.638 --> 07:52.933
- No, that's not what I meant.
- That is exactly what you meant.

07:53.141 --> 07:54.810
Well, okay, Frasier.

07:54.977 --> 07:58.021
No offence, your father
is a very nice man, but let's face it.

07:58.188 --> 08:01.441
My mother was the attorney general
of Wisconsin.

08:01.650 --> 08:05.946
Well, I hope he remembers
to curtsy before the Dairy Queen.

08:06.780 --> 08:09.407
This is ridiculous.
I'm gonna watch this in my room.

08:09.574 --> 08:14.621
Miss Finland just laid out her plan
to end world hunger and I missed it.

08:14.830 --> 08:17.374
- Oh, Lord, okay.
- They're back.

08:18.291 --> 08:21.127
Oh, Roz,
that is the best promo of all.

08:21.294 --> 08:23.838
Oh, hi. How was your evening?

08:24.005 --> 08:28.426
Oh, the jazz was first-rate,
but I'm afraid I talked Martin's ear off.

08:28.593 --> 08:31.388
Oh, you're crazy. Your mother
tells wonderful stories, Roz.

08:31.554 --> 08:35.265
- I could have listened to her all night.
- You are either too kind or a little tipsy.

08:35.475 --> 08:36.976
But thank you.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.104
- Come on, Lambie.
- Okay, let me get my coat.

08:39.270 --> 08:40.647
I really had a lovely time.

08:40.813 --> 08:42.899
Well, I can't remember
when I had a better time.

08:43.066 --> 08:44.776
We're gonna have to do this again.

08:44.984 --> 08:46.861
- Bye, Frasier.
- Good night, Joanna.

08:47.070 --> 08:49.280
- Lambie.
- Bye.

08:50.698 --> 08:55.119
So tell me all about it. Come on.

08:55.328 --> 08:57.539
Well, being a gentleman,
I don't wanna go into details.

08:57.705 --> 09:02.627
- So suffice it to say, it stunk!
- What?

09:02.835 --> 09:05.254
That was the dullest evening
of my life.

09:05.421 --> 09:08.049
- The way she drones on and on.
- Oh, no.

09:08.216 --> 09:09.967
Do you know how many
metric tons of eggs

09:10.134 --> 09:11.469
Wisconsin produces every year?

09:11.636 --> 09:13.930
- No.
- Well, I do.

09:14.138 --> 09:16.140
Look, Frasier,
I know you meant well.

09:16.349 --> 09:19.477
But if you ever set me up again,
I'll kill you in your sleep. Good night.

09:25.149 --> 09:26.192
Roz.

09:26.359 --> 09:29.278
I told my mom to meet me downstairs.
I just had to come up and tell you.

09:29.445 --> 09:31.280
She had the best time.

09:31.447 --> 09:33.449
She can't wait to go out
with your father again.

09:33.616 --> 09:35.576
Will you tell him
to call her tomorrow?

09:35.743 --> 09:38.287
Frasier, this whole thing
worked out like a dream.

09:38.496 --> 09:43.542
It's amazing.
Her voice is still echoing in my head.

09:44.502 --> 09:48.214
Yes, it's like a fairy tale
over here too.

09:52.468 --> 09:54.595
I've just got to find
some way to tell Roz.

09:54.804 --> 09:57.515
Well, why?
It's just gonna hurt her mom's feelings.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.350
Her feelings
are gonna be hurt anyway.

09:59.558 --> 10:02.061
She's here till Sunday.
She's expecting him to call.

10:02.228 --> 10:03.771
Oh, dear God.

10:03.938 --> 10:06.607
At least this way,
Roz can let her down easy.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.610
It looks like both of us have
difficult conversations ahead of us.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.362
- What's yours?
- All week long,

10:11.529 --> 10:15.199
I have been getting less coffee
and more foam in my cappuccino.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.327
It's about time for someone
to raise a little hell.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.703
Who's on steamer duty?

10:19.912 --> 10:22.456
Well, it's that hulking fellow, Thad.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.751
The one who doesn't react when
his arm touches the steamer nozzle.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.048
Where is that suggestion box?

10:33.592 --> 10:35.552
- Oh, hey, Frasier.
- Oh, Roz, hi.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.930
Double espresso to go, please.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.765
Listen, I really need
to thank you again.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.017
My mother had the best time
last night.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.561
And when we got home,
we started talking.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.271
We ended up staying up
half the night.

10:46.438 --> 10:49.149
- Oh, Roz, I'm glad for you, but...
- It was like a wall came down.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.568
She just opened up to me.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.779
She started telling me
about how hard it was on her

10:53.946 --> 10:56.823
when my dad left
and how Ionely she's been.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.242
It was like she was talking
to a girlfriend,

10:59.409 --> 11:01.328
instead of her screw-up daughter.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.330
So has Martin called her yet?

11:04.081 --> 11:08.585
No. But he will, soon.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.420
He had a really busy morning.

11:10.629 --> 11:13.298
How does his weekend look?
Because she's leaving Sunday night.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.175
Sunday? Oh, well, let's see.

11:15.342 --> 11:19.262
Tonight is poker night.
That's no good.

11:19.471 --> 11:24.100
Saturday, he's made plans
to drive Duke to Tacoma

11:24.309 --> 11:28.563
for that all-day Tacoma fest.

11:29.481 --> 11:33.234
Well, and Sunday we go to a matinee
and then I drive her to the airport.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.819
Oh, darn.

11:34.986 --> 11:37.906
Wait a minute, I can give my ticket
to Martin and they can go together.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.033
No, no, no, Sunday's no good,
because that's...

11:40.200 --> 11:42.952
- Oh, right. It's the Super Bowl.
- Right. The Super Bowl.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.914
And you know how Dad is
about football. It's like a religion to him.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.292
In fact, he's made Niles and I promise
that we'd watch it with him this year.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.503
Oh, well, okay, let's just forget
about the tickets

11:51.669 --> 11:54.380
and we'll come over to your place
and watch the game.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.508
Is there any reason
why that won't work?

11:56.674 --> 11:58.510
Not that I can come up with.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.639
That's great.
My mom's gonna be so excited.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.182
- Oh, thank you, Niles.
- Oh, yeah.

12:04.349 --> 12:07.185
I'll see you Sunday
at your Super Bowl party.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.941
I see you told Roz the news
and she went insane.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.153
Couldn't do it.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.073
Told her we were watching
the Super Bowl with Dad,

12:20.239 --> 12:21.949
and she and her mother
are coming over.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.326
This is a nightmare.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.953
I know, I know.
I've got to find some way to tell Dad.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.207
I have to watch the Super Bowl?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.251
Suppose the sooner I tell him,
the better.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.253
Oh, not necessarily.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.506
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know Dad.

12:36.714 --> 12:39.425
If you warn him Joanna's coming over,
he'll just bolt to McGinty's.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.136
If I were you, I would wait
till five minutes before game time,

12:42.303 --> 12:44.847
then spring it on him.
That way, he has no choice but to stay.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.308
Well, I think I owe him more
than five minutes' warning.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.810
Besides that, Dad would never
deliberately hurt Joanna

12:49.977 --> 12:51.312
by standing her up.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.606
He is first and foremost
a gentleman.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.358
I saw Roz, so I hid outside

12:55.524 --> 12:59.070
in case that old gasbag of
a mother was with her.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.866
Well, I guess she wasn't.
Everybody's still awake.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.584
Here we go.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.336
Look at those guys
in the locker room.

13:15.502 --> 13:19.006
Nervous, hearts pounding,
probably a little sick to their stomachs.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.758
- The poor kids.
- Yes.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.176
Until I got out of high school,

13:22.343 --> 13:25.179
I didn't know there was any other way
to feel in a locker room.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.973
What's the matter with you?
You keep looking at your watch.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.266
- Was I?
- Yeah.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.851
Is there something on your mind?

13:31.060 --> 13:32.353
No. No, no, no.

13:32.519 --> 13:35.898
But there's something I need to talk
to you about, but now is not the time.

13:36.356 --> 13:38.776
- Now is the time.
- Just let me get the door.

13:38.942 --> 13:41.278
No, Dad, that's what I have
to talk to you about.

13:41.487 --> 13:46.158
See, that's gonna be Roz
and her mother.

13:46.366 --> 13:47.826
- What?
- Well,

13:48.035 --> 13:50.204
Joanna had such a good time
with you the other night,

13:50.370 --> 13:52.456
and you did say
that you would see her again.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.666
Rather than send her home
with her feelings hurt,

13:54.875 --> 13:57.252
- I told her you wanted her here.
- What, like a date?

13:57.461 --> 14:00.088
That's the beauty of it.
It's like a date, but it's not a date.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.508
You just, you know, make small talk.
You pass the dip.

14:03.675 --> 14:05.344
No, Frasier, you don't understand.

14:05.510 --> 14:08.347
Look, Dad, I know that you found her
a little less than scintillating,

14:08.513 --> 14:10.515
but please,
it'll be over before you know it.

14:11.516 --> 14:12.559
Hey, Frasier.

14:12.726 --> 14:13.769
- Hi, Bonnie.
- Martin.

14:13.977 --> 14:17.814
Hey, Bonnie, glad you could make it.
Let me hold that, yes.

14:17.981 --> 14:20.066
See, this is what I was trying
to tell you, Frasier.

14:20.233 --> 14:22.319
- I invited Bonnie.
- Oh, how nice.

14:22.777 --> 14:23.945
So, what do you got here?

14:24.154 --> 14:26.615
Oh, it's my special devilled ham
in the shape of a football.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.409
But I still need to put on
some macaroni laces.

14:29.576 --> 14:31.703
Oh, okay. Well, the kitchen's
right down there.

14:31.870 --> 14:34.414
Just holler if you need anything.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.251
What did you invite her for?

14:38.460 --> 14:40.503
I like her, I thought
I might want to ask her out

14:40.712 --> 14:43.381
and if she came over,
that'd be a step in the right direction.

14:43.590 --> 14:46.217
You know, I mean,
like a date, but not a date.

14:47.969 --> 14:49.429
That's gonna be Roz
and her mother.

14:49.637 --> 14:51.347
Should I put some coffee on
while I'm here?

14:51.556 --> 14:53.683
You better. We're gonna need it.

14:53.850 --> 14:57.437
Come on, would it kill you to be civil
for the length of one Super Bowl?

14:57.645 --> 14:59.647
What is that,
an hour out of your life?

14:59.814 --> 15:02.358
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, sorry, come on in.

15:02.525 --> 15:06.321
- Thank you so much for inviting us.
- It wouldn't be any fun without you.

15:06.487 --> 15:08.656
Could you show my mom
where Alice can finish her nap?

15:08.823 --> 15:10.158
I'm sure Dad would love to. Dad?

15:10.325 --> 15:12.869
My pleasure, yeah.
Just come this way, Joanna.

15:13.036 --> 15:14.245
So you're a big football fan?

15:14.412 --> 15:16.289
No, actually,
I've never even seen a game.

15:16.456 --> 15:19.876
I was hoping you would explain
as we go along.

15:21.878 --> 15:23.546
Okay, who's hungry?

15:24.172 --> 15:25.840
Oh, hi, I'm Bonnie.

15:26.049 --> 15:29.469
Hi. From McGinty's.
Oh, I didn't know you were coming.

15:29.677 --> 15:33.681
Yeah, Martin invited me.
He was real cute about it.

15:33.890 --> 15:36.809
He checked with all the waitresses
to find out if I was single.

15:38.895 --> 15:41.189
Yes, well, you know how Dad is.
He's always trying to...

15:41.355 --> 15:43.191
Hey, hey, the Coyote.

15:44.233 --> 15:46.193
- Find a new girl for Niles.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.696
Niles, you remember Bonnie.
She waited on us at McGinty's.

15:48.905 --> 15:53.242
Oh, yes, of course.
I'll have a vodka martini, very dry.

15:53.784 --> 15:55.828
Don't be silly, Niles.
Bonnie is here as our guest.

15:56.037 --> 15:57.997
Yeah, your dad thought
you two might hit it off.

16:02.043 --> 16:05.796
The Super Bowl and a date.
Hot diggity.

16:07.173 --> 16:10.509
Well, come here.
You're just in time for my specialty.

16:13.053 --> 16:16.765
Isn't that interesting?
Something formerly ham.

16:19.351 --> 16:22.188
- Well, I'm off to the cinema.
- You're not staying for the game?

16:22.354 --> 16:24.315
Sorry, but American football's
not for me.

16:24.481 --> 16:26.984
<i>And they're showing
Wuthering Heights downtown.</i>

16:27.151 --> 16:29.361
I think it's the most romantic movie
ever made.

16:29.570 --> 16:32.114
- You're going alone?
- Yes, unfortunately.

16:32.323 --> 16:33.657
It's more fun to go with someone.

16:33.824 --> 16:35.826
Except, of course,
it always ends the same way.

16:35.993 --> 16:37.619
Me weeping
all over me date's shoulder,

16:37.786 --> 16:39.621
while he does what he can
to comfort me.

16:39.788 --> 16:42.875
Well, you should've seen me cry
putting onions in this ham loaf.

16:43.042 --> 16:46.587
I must have gone through
a whole roll of toilet paper.

16:48.755 --> 16:51.925
Well, enjoy your game.

16:52.551 --> 16:55.095
Frasier, may I see you
in the kitchen?

16:56.722 --> 16:59.266
That's amazing.
You do all that you do

16:59.433 --> 17:04.313
and still have time to be a docent at
the cheese museum on the weekends.

17:04.479 --> 17:06.147
Frasier, can I see you
in the kitchen?

17:06.315 --> 17:09.318
Just a second, Dad.
I gotta take drink orders in here.

17:12.612 --> 17:16.116
Thanks for setting me up
with that SPAM-happy tootsie.

17:17.034 --> 17:18.117
What are you talking about?

17:18.326 --> 17:20.787
Bonnie. Frasier told me
you invited her here for me.

17:20.996 --> 17:23.415
I invited her here for me.
He said I invited her for you

17:23.582 --> 17:25.709
because he didn't wanna hurt
Miss Boring's feelings.

17:25.916 --> 17:29.754
Now, now, no private conversations.
Your dates are waiting.

17:29.963 --> 17:32.299
- They're not our dates.
- We hate them.

17:34.092 --> 17:36.636
Now, listen, I realise
that this is a very difficult situation,

17:36.803 --> 17:40.307
but if we all cooperate,
we can send everybody home happy.

17:40.515 --> 17:42.142
And, Dad, if you would like,

17:42.350 --> 17:45.687
you can discreetly take Bonnie aside
and tell her what's going on.

17:46.271 --> 17:49.024
- Bonnie, can I tell you something?
- I said discreetly.

17:50.567 --> 17:52.444
I think the game is about to start.

17:52.610 --> 17:55.196
Oh, that reminds me.
I wanna get Alice's bottle warming.

17:55.363 --> 17:58.742
- Oh, you have a baby?
- Oh, the most adorable little girl.

17:58.908 --> 18:01.119
Yeah, she's a real beaut.
You ought to see her, Bonnie.

18:01.286 --> 18:04.247
- You can come when I feed her.
- No, you go ahead and get that ready.

18:04.456 --> 18:06.166
I'll show Bonnie.
It's right through there.

18:06.332 --> 18:08.877
Now, Dad, don't you get fresh
with Niles' girl there.

18:09.085 --> 18:11.254
Oh, I won't if he won't.

18:13.339 --> 18:16.467
Your father is really smitten
with that baby, isn't he?

18:16.676 --> 18:18.845
I think he's just got a weak spot
for the Doyle women.

18:19.053 --> 18:20.388
- Oh, now.
- Yes.

18:20.555 --> 18:22.932
Well, he may appear
to have a crusty exterior,

18:23.099 --> 18:26.185
but deep down inside,
Dad's just an old softy.

18:26.394 --> 18:28.479
<i>Well, there's the kid.</i>

18:28.646 --> 18:31.607
<i>Kind of a gooney-looking thing,
isn't she?</i>

18:31.816 --> 18:33.151
Is that Dad?

18:33.359 --> 18:35.194
<i>Look, Bonnie,
I gotta tell you something.</i>

18:35.403 --> 18:38.197
<i>I didn't ask you here for Niles.
I asked you here for me.</i>

18:38.406 --> 18:40.658
It's the baby monitor. We should...

18:41.284 --> 18:43.953
<i>- I wanna hear this.
- I thought you were with Joanna.</i>

18:44.120 --> 18:46.414
<i>No, no, Frasier and Roz
set us up last week.</i>

18:46.581 --> 18:48.499
<i>I told Frasier
I thought she was a big snooze,</i>

18:48.666 --> 18:51.043
<i>especially compared to the fun
you and I have at the bar,</i>

18:51.210 --> 18:52.461
<i>but he stuck me with her again.</i>

18:52.628 --> 18:54.463
You know, I think they know it's on.

18:54.630 --> 18:56.549
- They're just having some fun with us.
- Yeah.

18:56.757 --> 18:59.427
- Yeah, I better go tell him...
- Frasier, Frasier, just stay put.

18:59.593 --> 19:01.887
<i>Then Niles isn't my date?
Oh, there's a relief.</i>

19:02.096 --> 19:05.933
<i>- I mean, no offence, Marty, but...
- Hey, you don't have to tell me.</i>

19:06.142 --> 19:11.188
Okay. If anybody wants me,
I'll be at the movies.

19:11.814 --> 19:15.151
<i>So you really like me?
You're not just pulling my leg?</i>

19:15.359 --> 19:18.320
<i>- You want proof?
- I think we can turn this off now.</i>

19:18.487 --> 19:23.659
Joanna, I am so sorry.

19:24.285 --> 19:27.246
- I know it sounded bad, but...
- No, no, no, not at all.

19:27.454 --> 19:30.749
I'm sure your father meant "big
snooze" in the most flattering sense.

19:32.585 --> 19:35.587
- Roz, maybe we should leave.
- What were you thinking?

19:35.754 --> 19:38.465
Oh, Roz, I certainly wasn't thinking
that he had a date planned.

19:38.674 --> 19:42.136
I'm just gonna get Alice.
Mom, I'm so sorry.

19:42.302 --> 19:44.221
Believe me, 20 years in politics,

19:44.388 --> 19:47.725
I've been called worse things
than boring.

19:48.809 --> 19:52.813
Well, I hope you'll understand if
I just slip out

19:52.980 --> 19:56.233
- without saying goodbye to Martin.
- Of course, Joanna.

19:56.400 --> 20:00.445
The last thing we need today
is another awkward situation.

20:00.612 --> 20:03.282
Roz, knock, will you?!

20:08.078 --> 20:11.915
- I left my diaper bag.
- Right. Here you go.

20:12.124 --> 20:15.127
- Can you come in for a bit?
- I really shouldn't.

20:15.294 --> 20:19.089
Roz, I'm so sorry.

20:20.841 --> 20:22.259
It's all right.

20:22.426 --> 20:25.387
I mean, I'm not gonna say
that my mother wasn't hurt.

20:25.554 --> 20:28.932
But she did start to smile a little bit
about it on the way to the airport.

20:31.184 --> 20:34.604
You know, I've been, well, sitting here,

20:34.771 --> 20:38.775
trying to figure out why I was so eager
to play matchmaker for Dad.

20:38.984 --> 20:40.151
Oh, you're not alone.

20:40.318 --> 20:43.488
I mean, I was excited
once I thought it was going well.

20:43.697 --> 20:47.158
Well, I suspect I wasn't doing it so
much for him as it was doing it for me.

20:47.659 --> 20:50.870
You know, I see him here all the time,
all alone.

20:52.789 --> 20:55.458
I wonder if maybe
that's not gonna be me someday.

20:55.667 --> 20:59.004
Oh, my God,
I think the same thing sometimes

20:59.170 --> 21:01.631
when I see these older ladies
in my building.

21:01.798 --> 21:05.009
They all wanna babysit Alice,
just for the company.

21:05.176 --> 21:08.721
I mean, she's a cute baby,
but she ain't no Dorothy Parker.

21:09.889 --> 21:13.476
Oh, well, you know,
we're both gonna be fine.

21:13.685 --> 21:16.020
- Yeah.
- I was just thinking, though,

21:16.229 --> 21:20.108
if we want to play it safe,
we could make one of those pacts.

21:20.608 --> 21:24.279
Oh, you mean like, in 40 years,
if neither one of us finds anyone...?

21:24.445 --> 21:26.781
Yeah, exactly.
We'll marry each other.

21:26.990 --> 21:29.367
I was gonna say kill each other.

21:32.453 --> 21:35.832
Well, six of one. Bye.
