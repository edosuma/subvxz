I think when Terrence Witham
first got

47:33.540 --> 47:37.060

he saw it exactly as you did.

47:37.260 --> 47:38.700
It confirmed
it was of the period

47:38.900 --> 47:41.420
and keeping with the work
of Augustus Craig.

47:41.620 --> 47:44.220
And, yes, there was a mention
of a possible over-painting

47:44.420 --> 47:47.780
at the bottom of the canvas,
but that's not unusual.

47:47.980 --> 47:50.060
As far as he was concerned,
everything checked out.

47:50.260 --> 47:52.940
He bought a genuine
Augustus Craig

of what it was really worth.

[ Laughs ]

47:58.460 --> 47:59.860
But at some point,

48:00.060 --> 48:03.660
he became curious
about what was underneath.

48:03.860 --> 48:05.900
The over-painting was
at the bottom of the campus

48:06.100 --> 48:08.180
where the signature would be.

48:08.380 --> 48:10.140
So I think he found
Edith Jay's signature

48:10.340 --> 48:12.720
beneath that of Augustus Craig.

48:15.600 --> 48:19.300
Thereby confirming the theory

48:19.500 --> 48:22.300
that Craig had signed
his protégé's painting.

48:22.500 --> 48:24.860
- So Witham knew
it was Edith Jay's all along.

48:25.060 --> 48:29.340
- And he also knew that, unlike
an Augustus Craig original,

48:29.540 --> 48:31.100
a painting of a horse's backside
by a stable girl

48:31.300 --> 48:32.900
would be worthless
in comparison.

48:33.100 --> 48:35.060
- And he'd already agreed the
sale with the Art Committee.

48:35.260 --> 48:36.900
But more importantly,

48:37.100 --> 48:39.180
he knew that now the painting
was home in Shipton Abbott,

48:39.380 --> 48:40.820

48:41.020 --> 48:42.860
to finally prove
who the real artist was

48:43.060 --> 48:45.140
