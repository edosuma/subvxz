00:02.068 --> 00:03.352
CARLA: Hey, Cheers is filmed

00:03.352 --> 00:05.238
before a live studio audience.

00:07.741 --> 00:08.525
FRASIER: Hi, Wood.

00:08.525 --> 00:10.026
Let me get a beer, will you?

00:10.527 --> 00:12.529
Oh, say, what'd you
do to your thumb there?

00:12.529 --> 00:14.531
Oh, well, it's a long story, but, uh,

00:14.531 --> 00:17.534
I was playing this guy
some pool last night,

00:17.534 --> 00:20.537
and I had this one-
four-seven combination.

00:20.537 --> 00:21.538
Yeah.

00:21.538 --> 00:23.006
So, I was trying to show off

00:23.006 --> 00:24.507
and sink all of them in one shot,

00:24.507 --> 00:25.508
but the balls were positioned

00:26.009 --> 00:28.011
in such a way that I had to lean

00:28.011 --> 00:29.879
way over the edge of the table

00:29.879 --> 00:31.848
and get in a kind of twisted-up...

00:31.848 --> 00:34.350
Yeah, so, what, you fell
and you broke your thumb?

00:34.350 --> 00:35.852
No. I still couldn't get the shot,

00:35.852 --> 00:37.721
so I went and got the bridge

00:37.721 --> 00:39.139
and I got up on a chair

00:39.139 --> 00:41.024
and I put all my weight on the bridge.

00:41.024 --> 00:44.277
And it snapped and you
fell and broke your thumb?

00:44.277 --> 00:45.228
No.

00:45.228 --> 00:47.230
I made the shot and I beat the guy.

00:47.731 --> 00:50.233
Oh, so he got angry and
he broke your thumb, right?

00:50.233 --> 00:51.735
No, I beat him fair and square

00:51.735 --> 00:53.236
and he paid me the ten bucks he owed me.

00:53.737 --> 00:55.739
So, how did you break your thumb?

00:55.739 --> 00:57.741
I slipped on the ice on the way home.

01:01.244 --> 01:03.246
Woody, why did you go into

01:03.246 --> 01:06.750
all that long-winded
detail about the game?

01:06.750 --> 01:08.752
Well, now, it wouldn't
have been much of a story

01:08.752 --> 01:10.136
without the pool stuff.

01:11.337 --> 01:12.722
Hello, Woody.

01:12.722 --> 01:14.724
What happened to your thumb?

01:14.724 --> 01:16.226
Oh, I slipped on the ice.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.817
Woody, why didn't you tell him
the long, drawn-out version?

01:23.817 --> 01:26.069
That's the guy I was playing pool with.

01:29.405 --> 01:33.777
(piano plays)

01:33.777 --> 01:36.196
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:36.196 --> 01:39.199
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:39.199 --> 01:41.701
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:41.701 --> 01:45.205
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:45.205 --> 01:51.010
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:51.511 --> 01:53.012
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:53.012 --> 01:58.518
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:58.518 --> 02:03.022
? And they're always glad you came ?

02:03.022 --> 02:06.025
? You want to be where you can see ?

02:06.025 --> 02:08.527
? Our troubles are all the same ?

02:08.527 --> 02:13.533
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

02:13.533 --> 02:16.035
? You want to go where people know ?

02:16.035 --> 02:19.038
? People are all the same ?

02:19.038 --> 02:22.542
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:40.176 --> 02:42.595
What the hell is keeping Diane?

02:42.595 --> 02:44.597
I'm gonna be late for school.

02:44.597 --> 02:45.598
School, Carla?

02:45.598 --> 02:47.600
Well, I must say I'm
delightfully astonished.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.602
You know, I've always
held that adult education

02:50.103 --> 02:52.105
is one of the finest gifts
that one can give oneself.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.107
Kudos on joining the
ever-burgeoning ranks

02:54.107 --> 02:55.608
of enlightened, wondering minds

02:55.608 --> 02:57.110
seeking betterment through knowledge.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.612
It's traffic school, you nimrod.

03:01.998 --> 03:02.782
You got pinched, huh, Carla?

03:02.782 --> 03:04.284
Yeah, speeding.

03:04.284 --> 03:05.285
But it wasn't my fault.

03:05.785 --> 03:07.787
There was a leaf stuck on my windshield,

03:07.787 --> 03:10.790
and I had to gun her
up to 80 to blow it off.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.177
What, and the cop didn't believe you?

03:14.177 --> 03:15.929
No. Couldn't be bribed, either.

03:15.929 --> 03:19.432
Carla, what, you offered
a policeman money?

03:19.432 --> 03:21.935
Money? With a body like this? Huh.

03:24.437 --> 03:25.939
Hello, everyone.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.440
We're back.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.942
Sammy, where you been, man?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.860
Picking china patterns.

03:32.729 --> 03:37.483
This may have been the
stupidest morning of my life.

03:37.483 --> 03:38.985
Oh, Sam, don't forget.

03:38.985 --> 03:41.487
Tomorrow we register for flatware.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.489
The second stupidest.

03:43.489 --> 03:44.874
Well, did you select something nice?

03:44.874 --> 03:47.877
We've committed to
Royal Doulton's Carlisle

03:47.877 --> 03:49.629
for the fine china,

03:49.629 --> 03:51.965
but Sam still hasn't made up his mind

03:51.965 --> 03:53.967
about the everyday ware.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.468
Yes, I have.

03:55.468 --> 03:58.471
I, I like the dishes with
the different colored flowers.

03:58.471 --> 03:59.973
Oh, ish!

03:59.973 --> 04:01.474
Come on, I love those.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.977
They're just like I
had when I was a kid.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.428
They're real pretty,

04:05.428 --> 04:07.931
and-and if you don't like
the food on your plate,

04:07.931 --> 04:09.432
you can hide it in the pattern.

04:11.935 --> 04:13.436
Okay, fine.

04:13.436 --> 04:15.939
Well, uh, why don't you think about it,

04:15.939 --> 04:16.940
and if you still insist

04:17.440 --> 04:21.444
that they're not the
most garish, bourgeois,

04:21.444 --> 04:22.946
stomach-turningly ugly
pattern in the book,

04:22.946 --> 04:23.947
then that's what we'll get.

04:25.698 --> 04:28.034
She's making me nuts

04:28.034 --> 04:29.285
with this wedding stuff.

04:29.285 --> 04:30.586
So, ditch her.

04:30.586 --> 04:33.589
You know, if I had my way,

04:33.589 --> 04:35.591
I would find the nearest
justice of the peace

04:36.092 --> 04:37.093
and, and tie the knot.

04:37.093 --> 04:38.962
You know, that's not such a bad idea.

04:38.962 --> 04:40.296
Right. Or you could ditch her.

04:40.296 --> 04:43.683
Don't you have traffic
school, or something?

04:43.683 --> 04:45.468
Nuts! Now I'm gonna be late!

04:45.468 --> 04:49.472
Well, I guess I can make
it if I run all the yellows.

04:51.474 --> 04:53.476
Sam... Yo.

04:53.476 --> 04:56.479
I've got Penelope from the
bridal registry on the line,

04:56.479 --> 04:57.480
and we're going back

04:57.480 --> 04:58.982
over the linen choices.

04:59.482 --> 05:01.484
Now, for the fingertip towels

05:01.484 --> 05:03.987
in the guest bath, do
we want monogrammed,

05:03.987 --> 05:05.488
or is that too ootsie?

05:05.488 --> 05:07.874
The second thing you said.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.878
I agree.

05:11.878 --> 05:16.382
Of course... a simple
initial can be elegant.

05:16.382 --> 05:18.384
Oh, I think you'd better
look at the picture.

05:18.384 --> 05:19.886
I need a man's opinion.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.889
Frasier, help Diane, will you please?

05:25.391 --> 05:27.894
Sam, these will be our fingertip towels

05:27.894 --> 05:29.896
for the rest of our lives.

05:36.936 --> 05:39.939
We'd better get married
quick, or I'm gonna kill her.

05:41.941 --> 05:44.444
All right, all right, that's it.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.329
Bachelor party here tonight.

05:46.329 --> 05:47.747
What are you talking about?

05:47.747 --> 05:48.748
Well, didn't you hear the man?

05:48.748 --> 05:50.249
Uh, they might be eloping.

05:50.249 --> 05:52.118
And I'm not gonna be, uh, done out

05:52.118 --> 05:52.919
of my right as best man

05:53.419 --> 05:55.421
to, uh, throw him the best
wingding of the century.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.924
All right now, so
what're we gonna have...?

05:57.924 --> 05:59.425
Just a second here, Cliff.

05:59.425 --> 06:02.295
Uh, Sam asked you to be his best man?

06:02.295 --> 06:03.179
Well, not in so many words,

06:03.179 --> 06:04.680
but, uh, you know, who's closest?

06:04.680 --> 06:06.099
So, uh... (everybody talking)

06:06.099 --> 06:08.017
Hold on now, I don't know.

06:08.017 --> 06:10.520
I may not have known Sam
as long as some of you guys,

06:10.520 --> 06:12.522
but we're pretty darned close.

06:12.522 --> 06:15.024
I think I'm kind of like
the brother he never had.

06:15.024 --> 06:17.026
Wait, Woody, Sam has a brother.

06:17.026 --> 06:20.530
Guess we're not as close as I thought.

06:20.530 --> 06:22.532
Well, look, I think we better throw

06:22.532 --> 06:24.033
the greatest bachelor party

06:24.033 --> 06:26.402
for the greatest
bachelor who ever lived.

06:26.402 --> 06:27.870
Tell you what.

06:27.870 --> 06:29.872
I'll pick up some deli
platters and some champagne,

06:29.872 --> 06:30.873
and you guys can just reimburse me,

06:30.873 --> 06:32.375
you know, at your leisure, all right?

06:32.375 --> 06:34.377
CLIFF: Why didn't you
say so in the first place?

06:34.377 --> 06:36.379
Okay, we got the food and
the drink taken care of.

06:36.379 --> 06:37.880
Now we need a little
bit of entertainment.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.382
Who's gonna...?

06:39.382 --> 06:41.384
Well, I-I think
tradition calls for, uh,

06:41.384 --> 06:42.385
what about a stag film, huh?

06:42.385 --> 06:44.253
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think there's

06:44.253 --> 06:46.506
a place on my route
that might sell them.

06:46.506 --> 06:49.008
Uh, the, uh, Hot and
Nasty Video Boutique.

06:50.009 --> 06:53.012
Yeah, I think there might be
one or two laying around there.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.515
Okay, we got the food,
drink, entertainment.

06:55.515 --> 06:56.516
Now all we need is a, uh,

06:56.516 --> 06:58.434
a girl jumping out of the cake.

06:58.434 --> 06:59.435
(general agreement)

06:59.435 --> 07:01.320
Oh, yeah, I've seen them do that

07:01.320 --> 07:02.822
in the movies all the time.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.191
That seems like a waste
of good cake to me.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.744
You see, Woody, the cake

07:08.744 --> 07:09.529
is really immaterial.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.030
It's the girl who's the actual dessert.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.532
Right.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.534
Well, then I think it
should be Miss Chambers.

07:14.534 --> 07:15.785
FRASIER: Ooh. Aw, come on.

07:15.785 --> 07:17.620
Ee-i-ee-i-oh!

07:17.620 --> 07:21.124
Hey, listen, tractor-boy...

07:21.124 --> 07:23.126
you know,

07:23.126 --> 07:25.628
no guy wants his fiancée
jumping out of a cake.

07:25.628 --> 07:29.132
It's, I mean, it's like
taking your mother to the prom.

07:29.132 --> 07:31.134
(chuckling)

07:31.134 --> 07:33.136
Or so I'm told.

07:38.641 --> 07:39.642
PAUL: Okay, okay, okay,

07:40.143 --> 07:42.145
so where can we get Sammy someone hot?

07:42.645 --> 07:44.147
Dare we look in his book?

07:44.147 --> 07:46.649
Nah, Sammy's had all those girls.

07:47.150 --> 07:49.152
Oh, Sam, stop being
such a grumble-bunny.

07:49.152 --> 07:51.654
Just grit your teeth and
pick out a dust ruffle.

07:54.657 --> 07:55.658
Guys, I still say

07:55.658 --> 07:57.660
we're missing a bet
right under our noses.

07:57.660 --> 07:59.162
Look, pal, trust me...

07:59.162 --> 08:00.663
Oh, it's... that's okay.

08:00.663 --> 08:02.665
Listen, I... it wouldn't hurt to ask.

08:02.665 --> 08:04.167
CLIFF: No, no, no, no, don't, don't...

08:04.167 --> 08:05.668
Excuse me, Miss Chambers?

08:05.668 --> 08:07.170
Yes, Woody? Uh...

08:07.670 --> 08:10.173
Uh, would you like to jump out
of Sam's bachelor party cake?

08:10.173 --> 08:17.647
Woody, I abhor such
juvenile, sexist male rituals.

08:17.647 --> 08:19.849
Yeah, but would you do it?

08:21.150 --> 08:22.018
Just checking.

08:22.018 --> 08:23.486
All right, guys, you're right.

08:23.486 --> 08:24.987
We're going to have to find

08:24.987 --> 08:27.356
some other beautiful
girl to be Sam's dessert.

08:27.356 --> 08:30.109
Wait a minute.

08:30.109 --> 08:34.113
(laughing)

08:34.113 --> 08:35.615
I, I just realized

08:35.615 --> 08:38.618
why you want me,
the bride-to-be,

08:38.618 --> 08:41.120
to jump from the cake.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.121
It's a wonderful irony.

08:43.121 --> 08:44.373
(laughs)

08:44.373 --> 08:45.541
Oh...

08:45.541 --> 08:47.009
Of course I'll do it.

08:47.009 --> 08:48.010
Of course.

08:48.010 --> 08:49.011
Oh, great.

08:49.011 --> 08:50.963
Imagine me, of all people,

08:50.963 --> 08:53.466
missing the point of a joke.

08:53.466 --> 08:54.467
(laughing)

08:54.467 --> 08:56.469
Hey, don't worry about
it, Miss Chambers.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.970
It even happens to me.

09:03.392 --> 09:05.278
NORM: Sammy, uh, what
time you got there, man?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.230
11:15.

09:07.230 --> 09:10.233
11:15. How did it get so late so early?

09:10.233 --> 09:12.735
I'd better be getting home to, uh, Vera.

09:12.735 --> 09:14.237
(yawning): Oh, yeah.

09:14.237 --> 09:17.623
(everybody talking and yawning)

09:20.576 --> 09:22.578
Yeah, you know what they say:

09:22.578 --> 09:25.081
"An early bird catches
the obsessive-compulsive."

09:25.581 --> 09:26.582
(laughing)

09:27.083 --> 09:28.968
'Night, Sam.

09:28.968 --> 09:31.887
MAN: Oh, boy!

09:31.887 --> 09:34.890
They sure took off in
a hurry, didn't they?

09:34.890 --> 09:38.761
Yeah, but that doesn't seem
suspicious to you, does it?

09:41.147 --> 09:44.517
No, I... I guess not.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.068
Oh, hey, I have an idea.

09:46.068 --> 09:47.270
You go in the back

09:47.270 --> 09:49.989
and total these receipts,
and we'll get out of here.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.907
Okay.

09:51.907 --> 09:53.409
All right.

09:53.409 --> 09:55.411
Say, Woody, when I come back out here,

09:55.411 --> 09:58.414
there's not going to be a
surprise for me, is there?

09:58.414 --> 09:59.915
A surprise party, maybe?

09:59.915 --> 10:00.916
No.

10:00.916 --> 10:03.169
You're not lying, are you?

10:03.169 --> 10:05.955
Sam, you'd know if I was lying.

10:05.955 --> 10:07.840
I'd... I'd tell you.

10:10.126 --> 10:12.128
Right. I'll, uh, I'll be in my office.

10:12.128 --> 10:13.379
WOODY: All right.

10:17.683 --> 10:18.684
Come on in, guys.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.186
He doesn't suspect a thing.

10:22.688 --> 10:24.190
Come on down, fellas.

10:25.691 --> 10:27.693
(half-whispers)

10:29.695 --> 10:31.197
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

10:36.786 --> 10:40.539
Okay? In the words of the
immortal bard, "Party!"

10:40.539 --> 10:42.041
(silent cheering)

10:44.126 --> 10:47.129
Uh, Sam, you can go home now.

10:48.130 --> 10:49.999
EVERYONE: Surprise!

10:49.999 --> 10:52.251
(whooping and cheering)

10:52.251 --> 10:54.754
(laughter and applause)

10:54.754 --> 10:57.640
Wow!

10:57.640 --> 11:01.927
Sam, you should have seen
the look on your face!

11:08.067 --> 11:10.519
(music playing on video)

11:13.522 --> 11:14.523
SAM: Ooh!

11:14.523 --> 11:16.025
FRASIER: Hey!

11:16.025 --> 11:17.026
All right!

11:17.026 --> 11:18.027
(guys whooping)

11:18.027 --> 11:19.528
Boy! Thanks, guys.

11:19.528 --> 11:20.529
Yeah, man.

11:20.529 --> 11:23.032
That last scene gave me new
respect for rowing machines.

11:23.032 --> 11:24.917
I hear you, bud. Ooh!

11:24.917 --> 11:28.871
Hey, you guys, oh! Thank you.

11:28.871 --> 11:29.872
This has been fantastic.

11:30.373 --> 11:31.257
I have to admit

11:31.257 --> 11:32.508
that I used to think
that bachelor parties

11:33.008 --> 11:33.876
were kind of embarrassing.

11:33.876 --> 11:34.627
Get the lights!

11:34.627 --> 11:36.512
SAM: Oh, God, not again...

11:36.512 --> 11:38.464
(guys cheering)

11:45.771 --> 11:46.772
Girl in there, right?

11:46.772 --> 11:48.274
Well...

11:48.274 --> 11:50.142
Just your type.

11:52.945 --> 11:55.231
So make the obligatory
speech and have at her!

11:55.231 --> 11:56.649
GUYS: Yeah!

11:56.649 --> 11:59.402
Oh, no, I can't do it.

11:59.402 --> 12:00.903
I... you know... (scoffs)

12:00.903 --> 12:02.405
No, I-I know you went
to a lot of trouble.

12:02.405 --> 12:05.291
I'm sorry, but it
just wouldn't be right.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.209
CLIFF: What? Come on,
Sammy. What is this?

12:07.209 --> 12:10.079
Malone, King of the Road!

12:10.079 --> 12:13.833
(everyone whooping)

12:13.833 --> 12:15.217
Better make hay, buddy.

12:15.217 --> 12:16.218
After this, it is one woman

12:16.218 --> 12:17.720
for the rest of your life. Oh, boy.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.089
EVERYONE: Yeah...

12:21.590 --> 12:26.595
I-I never really thought
about it in those terms before.

12:26.595 --> 12:29.482
One woman for the rest of my life.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.233
(everyone chuckles) I
mean, don't get me wrong.

12:31.233 --> 12:33.602
I mean, she's... she's a...
she's a great woman, but, uh...

12:33.602 --> 12:35.821
there's only one of her...

12:37.656 --> 12:39.825
...for the rest of my life.

12:39.825 --> 12:41.277
But, you know, it'll go quickly.

12:41.277 --> 12:43.162
Just go-go ahead, cut the cake.

12:44.113 --> 12:45.614
Boy, it really makes you think.

12:45.614 --> 12:48.117
You know, I've been a
bachelor a good long time.

12:48.117 --> 12:51.003
I mean, a good lot of women.

12:51.003 --> 12:53.873
Now there won't be any more women.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.758
Just woman.

12:55.758 --> 12:57.376
One woman.

12:57.376 --> 12:59.345
Yeah, but what a woman!

12:59.345 --> 13:01.263
I mean, you know what? I've got an idea.

13:01.263 --> 13:02.264
Why don't we have some cake?

13:02.264 --> 13:05.017
(everyone agreeing)

13:05.017 --> 13:06.802
One perfume.

13:07.303 --> 13:08.804
One set of earlobes.

13:08.804 --> 13:11.190
Not, not even sensitive earlobes.

13:12.558 --> 13:17.813
One pair of lips flapping in my ears...

13:17.813 --> 13:19.732
day after day until I die.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.734
Oh, my God!

13:21.734 --> 13:23.202
Sammy, Sammy, that's great.

13:23.202 --> 13:25.704
Look, we got a big,
wonderful cake here, you know,

13:25.704 --> 13:28.207
with a... with a very
special surprise inside...

13:28.207 --> 13:32.161
which just might spoil
if you don't shut up!

13:33.162 --> 13:36.165
Uh... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13:36.165 --> 13:37.166
What am I doing?

13:37.166 --> 13:38.918
I mean, if I'm going to tie myself

13:38.918 --> 13:40.753
to the old ball and
chain, I might as well get

13:40.753 --> 13:43.255
one last night of freedom in here.

13:43.255 --> 13:45.257
(everyone agreeing)
Okay, bring her out here.

13:45.257 --> 13:46.141
Strap her on.

13:46.141 --> 13:47.059
Come on.

13:47.059 --> 13:48.060
EVERYONE: Yeah!

13:51.564 --> 13:54.066
Strap this on!

14:05.911 --> 14:09.415
Sam, you should see
the look on your face!

14:15.204 --> 14:16.071
Hi, guys.

14:16.572 --> 14:17.957
Hey, Carla, how was traffic school?

14:17.957 --> 14:19.291
Eh, it was all right.

14:19.792 --> 14:20.292
NORM: Yeah?

14:20.793 --> 14:22.294
Well, don't all those
gory movies they show

14:22.294 --> 14:23.796
kind of turn your stomach a bit?

14:23.796 --> 14:25.297
Hey, Norm, you're forgetting...

14:25.297 --> 14:27.299
I've seen Diane without makeup.

14:30.052 --> 14:31.053
Hello, everyone.

14:31.053 --> 14:32.555
Hi.

14:32.555 --> 14:33.556
Hello, you.

14:33.556 --> 14:35.057
Let me help you with that.

14:35.057 --> 14:36.058
Well, all right.

14:36.058 --> 14:37.059
Boy, you look fantastic, dear.

14:37.059 --> 14:38.561
That is a great outfit on you.

14:38.561 --> 14:40.062
Sam... Hmm?

14:40.062 --> 14:41.564
You make a lousy sycophant.

14:41.564 --> 14:44.567
Yes, but I make a great margarita.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.569
May I speak to you in
your office, please?

14:46.569 --> 14:48.821
Sure, anything you want. You bet cha.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.105
SAM: Oh, come on, smile.

14:50.105 --> 14:51.106
DIANE: For some reason,

14:51.106 --> 14:53.609
I don't feel like smiling.

14:53.609 --> 14:55.611
Did I ever tell you how cute you are

14:55.611 --> 14:57.613
when you're mad?

14:57.613 --> 15:00.115
Come on, listen, snap
out of this, will you?

15:00.115 --> 15:02.618
I mean, I-I didn't say
all that stuff last night

15:02.618 --> 15:04.620
to hurt your feelings.

15:06.121 --> 15:08.507
My feelings aren't hurt.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.460
I just feel bad for you.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.881
Sentenced to a life with one perfume...

15:17.883 --> 15:21.637
...one set of insensitive earlobes,

15:21.637 --> 15:25.941
one set of lips flapping in your ear...

15:27.810 --> 15:29.612
...till you die.

15:31.614 --> 15:34.483
Come on! I was with a bunch of guys.

15:34.483 --> 15:36.452
I mean, they forced me to make a speech.

15:36.452 --> 15:38.954
How the hell did I know
my fiancée was hiding

15:38.954 --> 15:40.823
in the cake, taking dictation?

15:41.707 --> 15:43.709
Did you mean it, Sam?

15:43.709 --> 15:44.576
No.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.379
See, it's just this...

15:47.379 --> 15:49.381
this whole marriage thing's

15:49.381 --> 15:51.884
kind of snuck up on me, that's all.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.886
I mean, I'm happy that
you're the only woman

15:53.886 --> 15:57.890
I'll make love to again... ever.

16:01.677 --> 16:02.678
(fingers snapping)

16:02.678 --> 16:04.063
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

16:04.063 --> 16:05.431
yeah, but-but, you see...

16:05.931 --> 16:07.816
I mean, if I had known

16:07.816 --> 16:10.185
that the last one was
going to be the last one,

16:10.185 --> 16:12.688
I-I-I would've
prepared myself for it.

16:14.073 --> 16:17.359
Sweetheart, it's kind of like popcorn.

16:17.359 --> 16:18.861
Now, you-you can munch away

16:18.861 --> 16:20.663
as long as you know there's a bowlful,

16:20.663 --> 16:22.081
but, you know, if all of a sudden,

16:22.081 --> 16:24.867
it's all gone, there's nothing
left but the salt and the duds,

16:24.867 --> 16:27.369
well, you feel bad,
because if you'd known

16:27.369 --> 16:30.873
the last kernel was the last
one, you would've savored it.

16:32.841 --> 16:35.177
Am I making myself clear on this?

16:35.177 --> 16:38.047
Oh, yes, yes...

16:38.047 --> 16:39.548
Oh. I'm salt and duds.

16:42.551 --> 16:46.055
Well, I-I-I
don't know. I...

16:46.055 --> 16:49.058
I don't know what to say to
make this right, except...

16:49.058 --> 16:51.810
I'm sorry.

16:53.529 --> 16:57.533
Would 24 hours of wild, uninhibited,

16:57.533 --> 17:03.038
hedonistic sexual carousing with
anything in a tube top suffice?

17:06.625 --> 17:10.628
In-in a-addition
to saying I'm sorry?

17:13.632 --> 17:16.635
Sam, you can apologize
till the cows come home,

17:16.635 --> 17:20.506
but it won't alleviate the problem.

17:20.506 --> 17:21.924
After much consideration,

17:21.924 --> 17:24.810
I propose that you go on a flesh binge.

17:27.229 --> 17:29.181
Sow your wild oats.

17:29.181 --> 17:31.683
Get it out of your system.

17:31.683 --> 17:35.187
Savor your last kernel of popcorn.

17:37.106 --> 17:38.107
Are you serious?

17:38.107 --> 17:39.608
Absolutely.

17:39.608 --> 17:42.611
It's the only way we can
establish a clean slate.

17:42.611 --> 17:46.615
No guilt, no remorse, no regrets.

17:46.615 --> 17:48.000
So...

17:48.000 --> 17:51.336
dive into that little black
book of yours and enjoy.

17:51.336 --> 17:52.838
Oh, you know,

17:52.838 --> 17:54.706
I threw that dumb thing
away when we got engaged.

17:54.706 --> 17:58.627
I'm sure you have one
or two numbers etched

17:58.627 --> 18:00.129
in your memory.

18:00.129 --> 18:01.880
You listen to me.

18:01.880 --> 18:06.051
I'm only going to agree to do
this because I love you, Diane.

18:09.354 --> 18:12.224
Well, don't do it for me, Sam.

18:12.224 --> 18:14.526
Do it for the health
of our future marriage.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.528
Right, right, right.

18:16.528 --> 18:18.030
Uh, excuse me, uh...

18:18.030 --> 18:21.533
when do my, uh, 24 hours begin?

18:21.533 --> 18:22.534
Right now.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.036
All right. The same as mine.

18:24.036 --> 18:27.039
Okay. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:29.541 --> 18:30.542
Yours?

18:30.542 --> 18:32.494
Of course, Sam.

18:32.494 --> 18:34.379
This is the only way we can be sure

18:34.379 --> 18:38.383
that I have all other
men out of my system.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.728
No... no...

19:02.241 --> 19:04.109
Sammy back yet?

19:04.109 --> 19:04.910
Uh, well, uh,

19:04.910 --> 19:07.412
"T" minus 30 minutes and counting.

19:07.412 --> 19:10.282
I figure right about now,

19:10.282 --> 19:14.169
Sammy's probably leaning
back in bed and smoking.

19:14.169 --> 19:16.171
Oh, wait, I don't, uh, remember

19:16.171 --> 19:18.173
ever seeing Sammy smoke a cigarette.

19:18.173 --> 19:20.592
Who said anything about cigarettes?

19:23.595 --> 19:24.596
Ho, the man!

19:24.596 --> 19:25.964
All right!

19:25.964 --> 19:27.933
Hey, what's the score, Sammy?

19:27.933 --> 19:30.936
Oh, Norm, you know he's not the
kind of guy to kiss and tell...

19:30.936 --> 19:33.438
not that he wastes much time
kissing, anyway, eh, compadre?

19:34.439 --> 19:37.442
Yeah, you guys know me, all right.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.945
So, has anyone, uh...
anyone heard from Diane?

19:40.445 --> 19:42.447
No, not a word. It's been heaven. Ah.

19:42.447 --> 19:43.899
Why? You worried about her?

19:43.899 --> 19:44.900
No, I'm not worried.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.401
Wha-What makes you think I'm worried?

19:46.401 --> 19:47.903
Uh, what time is it, anyway?

19:47.903 --> 19:50.405
It's time for you to stop worrying.

19:50.405 --> 19:51.907
I mean, for God's sakes, Sammy,

19:51.907 --> 19:54.910
who'd be stupid enough to touch Diane?

19:54.910 --> 19:56.411
Besides you.

19:56.411 --> 19:57.412
Good point.

19:57.412 --> 20:00.415
You know, uh, yeah, what
am I worried about here?

20:00.415 --> 20:02.885
Oh, Rick, you really came through.

20:04.503 --> 20:05.837
Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam!

20:05.837 --> 20:07.839
Rick was kind enough to drive me to work

20:07.839 --> 20:10.342
when my car broke down.

20:11.843 --> 20:13.345
I knew that.

20:13.345 --> 20:14.229
I, uh...

20:14.229 --> 20:17.149
I just wanted to give
him a thank-you shake.

20:17.649 --> 20:19.651
Thank you, thank you.

20:22.020 --> 20:27.993
Uh, maybe I'll, uh, take
a rain check on that drink.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.495
Uh, good luck with your marriage.

20:30.495 --> 20:31.496
Yes. Thank you.

20:31.997 --> 20:32.998
Thank you. Thank you very much.

20:33.498 --> 20:34.499
Thank you, Rick.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.002
Well...

20:37.002 --> 20:39.004
I guess I'll just, uh...

20:39.004 --> 20:41.006
begin my shift.

20:41.006 --> 20:43.008
Uh, yeah, like hell you will!

20:43.008 --> 20:45.010
Sam? Now, Sam! Sam!

20:48.013 --> 20:48.880
All right.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.633
Where were you last night, hmm?

20:54.019 --> 20:57.522
I was taking full
advantage of my 24 hours.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.476
I looked into the recesses of my heart,

21:01.476 --> 21:03.979
and I realized that I still had...

21:04.479 --> 21:06.982
one oat that needed to be sown.

21:08.984 --> 21:11.486
One fantastic oat.

21:11.486 --> 21:15.240
Is that all you
think about-- sex?

21:17.042 --> 21:19.044
You know, it's disgusting!

21:19.044 --> 21:22.047
Wh-Wh-Whatever happened
to romance, to commitment?

21:22.047 --> 21:23.048
I mean, look at you!

21:23.048 --> 21:25.917
Look at you-- you haven't
even changed your dress!

21:27.336 --> 21:30.839
I am wearing this dress
again because I like it.

21:30.839 --> 21:33.225
It sets off my eyes.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.093
Yeah, I'll set off your eyes.

21:35.093 --> 21:36.478
You know...

21:36.478 --> 21:37.929
You want know something?

21:37.929 --> 21:40.432
I had the exact same 24 hours you did,

21:40.432 --> 21:41.433
and I didn't do anything.

21:41.433 --> 21:42.434
You know why?

21:42.434 --> 21:44.936
Because I happen to be a one-woman guy.

21:44.936 --> 21:46.738
I mean, I mean,

21:46.738 --> 21:48.273
I think we got something
special going here,

21:48.273 --> 21:50.275
and I didn't want to cheapen
it, like somebody else

21:50.776 --> 21:51.777
I could mention.

21:51.777 --> 21:55.747
You-you know, people could
refer to you as a tart.

21:58.667 --> 22:00.669
How can you say that?

22:00.669 --> 22:02.120
Easy. Tart!

22:02.120 --> 22:04.006
Tart, tart, tart, tart!

22:04.006 --> 22:05.173
I mean, what-what else

22:05.173 --> 22:06.875
do you call somebody who didn't go home?

22:06.875 --> 22:08.760
How do you know that?

22:08.760 --> 22:12.264
Because I was idiot enough
to spend the entire night

22:12.264 --> 22:14.266
watching your apartment from my car,

22:14.266 --> 22:16.134
and you did not go home.

22:18.437 --> 22:20.806
Well, you must be exhausted.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.307
Yeah, yeah, that's right! I'm exhausted.

22:22.307 --> 22:23.809
You're damned right, I'm exhausted.

22:23.809 --> 22:25.811
Oh, come on, Sam.

22:25.811 --> 22:28.563
Now, you had a little
catnap around 6:00 a.m.

22:28.563 --> 22:29.364
Did not.

22:30.365 --> 22:32.367
How'd you know that?

22:33.368 --> 22:34.870
Because I was down the street

22:34.870 --> 22:37.239
in my car watching you watch me.

22:40.158 --> 22:43.045
Oh, my God, you spied on me!

22:43.045 --> 22:44.913
I mean, that stinks!

22:44.913 --> 22:48.800
What... what hap...
what happened to faith?

22:48.800 --> 22:52.304
What-what-what happened...
what happened to trust?

22:52.304 --> 22:53.805
My God!

22:53.805 --> 22:55.307
Sam!

22:56.308 --> 22:58.810
I took a lover's leap of faith

22:58.810 --> 23:01.813
in granting you sexual carte blanche

23:01.813 --> 23:06.768
for the past 24 hours!

23:06.768 --> 23:10.155
And just as my heart suspected,

23:10.155 --> 23:11.907
instead of gallivanting about,

23:11.907 --> 23:14.910
you spent the whole time spying on me.

23:16.411 --> 23:17.913
(wry chuckle)

23:17.913 --> 23:21.416
I had one last night to go
out and have a great time,

23:21.416 --> 23:22.834
and I blow it.

23:22.834 --> 23:25.921
God, I'm a poor excuse for a stud.

23:29.374 --> 23:30.959
I don't know about that.

23:30.959 --> 23:33.962
We still have five minutes left...

23:33.962 --> 23:36.348
in our deal.

23:37.265 --> 23:38.767
Five minutes?

23:38.767 --> 23:39.768
Mm-hmm.

23:39.768 --> 23:42.771
Well, hell, somebody
should've told me that.

23:46.274 --> 23:47.275
Damn it!

23:51.363 --> 23:53.365
How long did you say we have here?

23:53.365 --> 23:54.366
Five minutes.

23:54.366 --> 23:56.368
Not enough time. Now, come on, Sam.

23:56.368 --> 23:57.869
We'd better skip to the good part.

23:57.869 --> 23:59.371
No... come on.

23:59.371 --> 24:02.874
We have to go to work! Sam! Whoo!
