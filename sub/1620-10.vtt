02:08.461 --> 02:10.464
Look at me. Look at me!

02:11.298 --> 02:13.842
Do you remember me now, boy, eh?

02:13.926 --> 02:16.386
Remember me?
There's a bright boy.

02:18.180 --> 02:23.101
You'll be coming with me, boy,
and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.704
- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- I'm not a boy!

02:42.788 --> 02:45.541
You're not a smart boy,
is that what you're trying to say?

02:45.624 --> 02:47.459
Do you want to live, boy?!

02:51.004 --> 02:53.423
North, boy, we're going north.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.292
It had three eyes.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.378
It told me to come with him, so I did.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.632
We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.635
Your father's not down there, little lord.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.554
Not for many years yet.

03:42.389 --> 03:47.186
- You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
- I'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.

03:47.311 --> 03:50.439
You've lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scared of?

03:51.273 --> 03:53.483
I'm a crippled boy and I'm willing to go.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.075
That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard.

04:02.201 --> 04:05.037
He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.957
That's Lyanna, my father's sister.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.502
King Robert was supposed to marry her,

04:11.585 --> 04:13.587
but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.964
Robert started a war to win her back.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.177
He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.764
That's where I saw Father.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.644
You see? He's not here.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.363
- Here, Shaggydog.
- Rickon!

04:40.614 --> 04:43.659
That beast is supposed to be
chained in the kennels!

04:43.784 --> 04:46.954
- He doesn't like chains.
- What are you doing down here?

04:47.037 --> 04:50.374
- Come back up with us.
- No, I came to see Father.

04:50.499 --> 04:55.003
How many times have I told you?
He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.548
He was down here. I saw him.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.341
Saw him when?

04:59.424 --> 05:02.636
Last night, when I was sleeping.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.305
Here, Shaggydog.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.522
You both miss him.

05:13.647 --> 05:18.151
It's only natural he should
be in your thoughts and dreams,

05:18.277 --> 05:20.195
but that doesn't mean that...

05:21.446 --> 05:22.948
Bran...

05:40.674 --> 05:42.509
- My lady.
- My lady.

05:42.634 --> 05:43.594
My lady.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.928
My lady.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.680
- My lady.
- My lady.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.266
My lady.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.191
Robb.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.402
Robb.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.408
Robb!

06:52.371 --> 06:54.665
You've ruined your sword.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.469
Shh! Shh!

07:07.553 --> 07:09.638
- Shh!
- I'll kill them all.

07:11.807 --> 07:14.643
- Every one of them.
- Shh.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.311
I will kill them all.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.857
My boy.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.444
They have your sisters.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.574
We have to get the girls back.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.328
And then we will kill them all.

07:39.293 --> 07:43.422

08:45.776 --> 08:47.861
Isn't it a funny song?

08:48.904 --> 08:51.073
Thank you for your rendition.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.742
I imagine it was even better received
at that tavern.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.911
I'm so sorry, Your Grace.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.121
I'll never sing it again, I swear.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.499
Tell me, which do you favour -

09:01.166 --> 09:03.460
your fingers or your tongue?

09:03.585 --> 09:04.753
Your Grace?

09:04.837 --> 09:06.463
Fingers or your tongue?

09:06.588 --> 09:09.216
If you got to keep one, which would it be?

09:12.636 --> 09:14.763
Or I could just cut your throat.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.600
Every man needs hands, Your Grace.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.394
Good.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.188
- Tongue it is.
- Your Grace, please.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.232
I won't sing, Your Grace.

09:25.357 --> 09:28.443
Ser Ilyn, who better than you
to carry out the sentence?

09:28.610 --> 09:30.988
I beg you! Please, no.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.408
No!

09:36.743 --> 09:39.621
Your Grace, please.
I beg you, I will never sing again!

09:39.746 --> 09:42.708
- I'm done for the day.
- No!

09:42.833 --> 09:45.210
I'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.882
Your Grace, please!

09:57.598 --> 09:58.724
You look quite nice.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.687
- Thank you, my lord.
- "Your Grace." I'm King now.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.940
Stop! No!

10:07.065 --> 10:10.152
Walk with me.
I want to show you something.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.783
Do as you're bid, child.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.710
...and as soon as you've had your blood,
I'll put a son in you.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.879
Mother says that shouldn't be long.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.093
No! Please, no!

10:35.219 --> 10:36.970
This one's your father.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.307
This one here.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.727
Look at it and see what happens to traitors.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.730
- You promised to be merciful.
- I was.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.941
I gave him a clean death.

10:50.651 --> 10:51.902
Look at him.

10:52.027 --> 10:55.072
Please let me go home.
I won't do any treason, I swear...

10:55.197 --> 11:00.160
Mother says I'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here... and obey.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.580
Look at him!

11:12.256 --> 11:13.966
Well?

11:14.091 --> 11:16.051
How long do I have to look?

11:18.637 --> 11:21.056
As long as it pleases me.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.185
Do you want to see the rest?

11:25.310 --> 11:27.646
If it please Your Grace.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.731
That's your Septa there.

11:31.859 --> 11:35.487
I'll tell you what,
I'm going to give you a present.

11:35.612 --> 11:39.241
After I raise my armies
and kill your traitor brother,

11:39.366 --> 11:41.910
I'm going to give you his head as well.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.454
Or maybe he'll give me yours.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.380
My mother tells me a king
should never strike his lady.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.091
Ser Meryn.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.948
Here, girl.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.495
Will you obey now?

12:26.455 --> 12:28.373
Or do you need another lesson?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.170
I'll look for you in court.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.800
Save yourself some pain, girl.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.761
Give him what he wants.

12:42.888 --> 12:44.515
You'll be needing that again.

13:05.661 --> 13:07.955
The proper course is clear -

13:08.121 --> 13:12.751
pledge fealty to King Renly
and move south to join our forces with his.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.004
Renly is not the king.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.590
You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.509
He put your father to death.

13:20.551 --> 13:22.511
That doesn't make Renly king.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.305
He's Robert's youngest brother.

13:26.014 --> 13:30.394
If Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me,
Renly can't be king before Stannis.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.521
Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?

13:32.604 --> 13:35.232
- Renly is not right!
- My lords.

13:35.357 --> 13:38.235
- If we put ourselves behind Stannis...
- My lords!

13:38.360 --> 13:41.530
Here is what I say to these two kings.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.869
Renly Baratheon is nothing to me,

13:46.994 --> 13:49.413
nor Stannis neither.

13:49.496 --> 13:54.334
Why should they rule over me and mine
from some flowery seat in the South?

13:54.418 --> 13:58.297
What do they know of the Wall
or the Wolfswood?

13:59.506 --> 14:01.383
Even their gods are wrong!

14:05.345 --> 14:08.640
Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again?

14:08.724 --> 14:10.809
It was the dragons we bowed to...

14:10.934 --> 14:13.896
and now the dragons are dead!

14:15.522 --> 14:21.695
There sits the only king
I mean to bend my knee to -

14:21.778 --> 14:23.906
the King in the North!

14:31.830 --> 14:33.457
I'll have peace on those terms.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.084
They can keep their Red Castle

14:36.210 --> 14:39.004
and their iron chair too.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.965
The King in the North!

14:44.051 --> 14:46.929
Am I your brother, now and always?

14:47.054 --> 14:48.555
Now and always.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.144
My sword is yours...

14:54.228 --> 14:58.273
in victory and defeat,
from this day until my last day.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.109
The King in the North!

15:01.235 --> 15:05.030
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

15:05.155 --> 15:07.115
The King in the North!

15:07.241 --> 15:10.827
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

15:10.911 --> 15:12.496
The King in the North!

15:12.621 --> 15:16.583
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

15:16.667 --> 15:18.544
The King in the North!

15:18.627 --> 15:22.631
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

15:22.756 --> 15:24.341
The King in the North!

15:28.887 --> 15:31.265
- Lady Stark.
- I want to see him.

15:32.558 --> 15:33.976
Now!

15:54.997 --> 15:56.373
Leave us.

16:01.879 --> 16:04.715
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.550
Widowhood becomes you.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.346
Your bed must be lonely.

16:11.430 --> 16:13.265
Is that why you came?

16:14.641 --> 16:18.061
I'm not at my best,
but I think I could be of service.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.940
You slip out of that gown
and we'll see if I'm up to it.

16:26.278 --> 16:29.364
Oh, I do like a violent woman.

16:29.489 --> 16:33.368
I will kill you tonight, ser...

16:33.452 --> 16:36.205
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.748
Let me show you how...

16:37.873 --> 16:40.250
Hit me again, over the ear.

16:40.334 --> 16:45.380
And again and again. You're stronger
than you look. It shouldn't take long.

16:45.506 --> 16:49.134
That is what you want the world to believe,
isn't it? That you don't fear death.

16:49.218 --> 16:51.428
But I don't, my lady.

16:51.553 --> 16:54.765
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?

16:54.890 --> 16:58.435
Because you are going
to the deepest of the seven hells,

16:58.560 --> 17:01.730
- if the gods are just.
- What gods are those?

17:03.023 --> 17:05.901
The trees your husband prayed to?

17:06.026 --> 17:09.195
Where were the trees
when his head was getting chopped off?

17:09.279 --> 17:13.075
If your gods are real and if they are just...

17:13.157 --> 17:15.327
why is the world so full of injustice?

17:16.703 --> 17:19.580
Because of men like you.

17:20.749 --> 17:23.126
There are no men like me.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.253
Only me.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.761
My son Bran.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.306
How did he come to fall from that tower?

17:36.390 --> 17:37.933
I pushed him out the window.

17:41.478 --> 17:42.896
Why?

17:44.439 --> 17:47.442
I... hoped the fall would kill him.

17:47.484 --> 17:48.944
Why?

17:57.369 --> 17:59.288
You should get some sleep.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.623
It's going to be a long war.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.984
I can't believe we're actually at war.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.322
Was it this exciting last time,
when you were young?

18:37.159 --> 18:39.161
What does it say?

18:40.370 --> 18:42.789
Have we captured Robb Stark yet?

18:42.956 --> 18:45.167
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

18:46.543 --> 18:48.378
Get back into bed.

18:56.762 --> 18:58.347
They have my son.

19:01.475 --> 19:04.269
The Stark boy appears
to be less green than we'd hoped.

19:04.353 --> 19:07.648
I've heard his wolf killed a dozen men
and as many horses.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.358
Is it true about Stannis and Renly?

19:09.483 --> 19:12.152
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

19:12.236 --> 19:14.738
Jaime captured, his armies scattered...

19:14.780 --> 19:16.657
it's a catastrophe.

19:17.658 --> 19:19.660
Perhaps we should sue for peace.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.832
There's your peace.

19:25.958 --> 19:29.628
Joffrey saw to that when he decided
to remove Ned Stark's head.

19:30.504 --> 19:32.840
You'll have an easier time
drinking from that cup

19:33.006 --> 19:35.968
than you will bringing Robb Stark
to the table now.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.511
He's winning...

19:37.636 --> 19:41.807
- in case you hadn't noticed.
- I'm told we still have his sisters.

19:41.890 --> 19:44.268
The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

19:44.393 --> 19:47.604
No truces. We can't afford to look weak.
We should march on them at once.

19:47.688 --> 19:49.940
First we must return to Casterly Rock
to raise...

19:50.023 --> 19:52.484
They have my son!

19:55.195 --> 19:57.197
Get out, all of you.

20:07.749 --> 20:09.877
Not you.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.603
You were right about Eddard Stark.

20:29.605 --> 20:35.694
If he were alive, we could have used him to
broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun,

20:35.861 --> 20:41.283
which would have given us more time
to deal with Robert's brothers. But now...

20:41.366 --> 20:44.286
Madness. Madness and stupidity.

20:47.581 --> 20:50.292
I always thought you were a stunted fool.

20:52.002 --> 20:54.129
Perhaps I was wrong.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.923
Half wrong.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.927
I'm new to strategy, but...

21:00.052 --> 21:04.014
Unless we want to be surrounded
by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.

21:04.056 --> 21:06.808
No one will stay here.

21:06.892 --> 21:09.561
Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders

21:09.686 --> 21:13.732
and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

21:13.857 --> 21:16.860
The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.

21:18.946 --> 21:21.240
And you will go to King's Landing.

21:22.407 --> 21:24.701
- And do what?
- Rule.

21:25.953 --> 21:29.039
You will serve as Hand of the King
in my stead.

21:29.122 --> 21:32.334
You will bring that boy king to heel,
and his mother too, if needs be.

21:32.459 --> 21:36.088
And if you get so much as a whim of treason
from any of the rest -

21:36.171 --> 21:39.216
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle...
- Heads, spikes, walls.

21:40.592 --> 21:42.678
Why not my uncle?

21:42.845 --> 21:45.013
Why not anyone? Why me?

21:45.138 --> 21:47.474
You're my son.

21:54.857 --> 21:57.234
Oh, one more thing.

21:57.276 --> 22:00.612
You will not take that whore to court.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.406
Do you understand?

22:22.217 --> 22:23.719
Ser Jorah?

22:27.848 --> 22:30.893
Gently, gently.

22:32.853 --> 22:34.396
My son...

22:34.479 --> 22:36.857
Where is he? I want him.

22:39.776 --> 22:41.278
Where is he?

22:43.488 --> 22:45.574
The boy did not live.

22:52.456 --> 22:55.459
- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?

22:55.584 --> 22:57.836
How did my son die?

22:59.755 --> 23:02.424
He never lived, my princess.

23:02.508 --> 23:04.009
The women say...

23:04.134 --> 23:06.261
What do the women say?

23:09.097 --> 23:13.852
- They say the child was...
- Monstrous, twisted.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.854
I pulled him out myself.

23:17.481 --> 23:19.983
He was scaled like a lizard,

23:20.067 --> 23:24.321
blind, with leather wings
like the wings of a bat.

23:24.446 --> 23:27.491
When I touched him
the skin fell from his bones.

23:27.574 --> 23:31.370
Inside... he was full of graveworms.

23:34.122 --> 23:38.335
I warned you that only death
can pay for life.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.337
You knew the price.

23:41.171 --> 23:43.340
Where is Khal Drogo?

23:43.465 --> 23:45.509
Show him to me.

23:45.634 --> 23:51.014
Show me what I bought with my son's life.

23:51.098 --> 23:53.100
As you command, lady.

23:54.184 --> 23:56.645
Come. I will take you to him.

23:56.770 --> 23:59.565
- Time enough for that later...
- I want to see him now.

24:15.581 --> 24:17.541
The khalasar is gone.

24:17.666 --> 24:20.377
A khal who cannot ride is no khal.

24:20.502 --> 24:23.130
The Dothraki follow only the strong.

24:24.214 --> 24:26.133
I'm sorry, my Princess.

24:38.103 --> 24:39.354
Drogo!

24:41.148 --> 24:42.828
[Shekh ma shieraki anni!]
My sun and stars.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.568
Why is he out here alone?

24:44.693 --> 24:47.529
He seems to like the warmth, Princess.

24:51.867 --> 24:53.577
He lives.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.705
You asked for life, you paid for life.

24:56.788 --> 25:00.000
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

25:00.125 --> 25:03.170
When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east.

25:03.295 --> 25:08.217
When the seas go dry. When the mountains
blow in the wind like leaves.

25:24.066 --> 25:25.266
Leave us.

25:26.735 --> 25:29.035
I don't want you alone with this sorceress.

25:29.040 --> 25:32.252
I have nothing more to fear
from this woman.

25:33.742 --> 25:35.160
Go.

25:40.582 --> 25:44.253
You knew what I was buying
and you knew the price.

25:45.003 --> 25:46.964
It was wrong of them to burn my temple.

25:47.089 --> 25:50.592
- It angered the Great Shepherd.
- This is not God's work.

25:50.717 --> 25:53.679
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

25:53.804 --> 25:56.765
He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.

25:56.849 --> 26:01.061
Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar
will trample no nations into dust.

26:01.186 --> 26:03.605
I spoke for you.

26:03.730 --> 26:06.775
- I saved you.
- Saved me?

26:08.902 --> 26:13.532
Three of those riders had already
raped me before you saved me, girl.

26:16.451 --> 26:18.996
I saw my god's house burn,

26:19.955 --> 26:23.625
there where I had healed men and women
beyond counting.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.044
In the streets I saw piles of heads...

26:26.170 --> 26:28.505
the head of the baker who makes my bread,

26:28.589 --> 26:32.926
the head of a young boy that I had
cured of fever just three moons past.

26:33.010 --> 26:38.223
So... tell me again
exactly what it was that you saved?

26:38.348 --> 26:40.267
Your life.

26:42.352 --> 26:44.813
Why don't you take a look at your khal...

26:46.690 --> 26:49.526
Then you will see exactly
what life is worth...

26:49.651 --> 26:52.321
when all the rest has gone.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.668
You can't!

27:08.170 --> 27:09.546
Get out of my way, Sam.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.548
They'll put out the word.

27:11.632 --> 27:15.219
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

27:15.302 --> 27:18.180
Do you know what happens to deserters?

27:20.682 --> 27:22.351
Better than you do.

27:23.227 --> 27:24.978
What are you going to do?

27:25.103 --> 27:27.022
I'm gonna find my brother

27:27.147 --> 27:29.942
and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.

27:31.109 --> 27:34.530
You can't leave us now.
We need you here.

27:35.572 --> 27:38.408
- Move.
- I won't let you go.

27:38.992 --> 27:41.203
- Move.
- No.

27:42.079 --> 27:43.789
Hyah!

27:58.929 --> 28:01.598
Hand of the King?

28:01.682 --> 28:03.809
So it would seem.

28:03.934 --> 28:08.313
And your father said you couldn't
take anyone with you to King's Landing?

28:08.438 --> 28:11.066
No, he said I couldn't take you with me
to King's Landing.

28:11.191 --> 28:14.987
- He was very specific on that point.
- He knew my name?

28:15.737 --> 28:16.697
What?

28:16.780 --> 28:19.408
He said,
"Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?

28:20.200 --> 28:22.369
I believe he used the word "whore".

28:23.787 --> 28:25.539
Are you ashamed of me?

28:25.581 --> 28:28.750
Are you afraid that I'm dancing around
the court with my tits out?

28:30.544 --> 28:31.712
I'm funny now?

28:31.837 --> 28:33.964
I'm Shae, the funny whore.

28:35.340 --> 28:38.218
My father's probably the most powerful man
in the country.

28:38.343 --> 28:39.803
Certainly the richest.

28:39.928 --> 28:42.347
He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets.

28:42.472 --> 28:47.352
Everyone everywhere always has to do
exactly what my father says.

28:48.896 --> 28:50.772
He's always been a cunt.

28:57.905 --> 29:01.158
I believe the ladies of the court
could learn a great deal

29:01.283 --> 29:02.993
from a girl like you.

29:05.120 --> 29:09.333
Why don't you come with me,
be the Hand's lady?

29:10.751 --> 29:14.046
Because the king needs a Hand
and the Hand...

29:17.883 --> 29:20.052
I know what a Hand needs.

29:33.815 --> 29:34.900
Ghost?

29:34.983 --> 29:36.109
Hyah!

29:36.235 --> 29:38.570
Hyah! Hyah!

29:41.949 --> 29:43.033
Hyah!

29:47.454 --> 29:49.039
Samwell!

29:50.541 --> 29:53.043
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not dead.

29:53.168 --> 29:54.753
Did we get him?

29:54.795 --> 29:56.672
Come on, help me get him up.

29:59.174 --> 30:02.177
Lucky you've got plenty of padding.

30:04.137 --> 30:06.223
We're taking you back to where you belong.

30:06.306 --> 30:08.892
- I belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.

30:09.017 --> 30:10.857
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.

30:10.894 --> 30:13.230
They'll kill you if they know
you came after me.

30:13.313 --> 30:16.400
- Go back.
- Sam told us everything.

30:16.483 --> 30:19.111
- We're sorry about your father.
- But it doesn't matter.

30:19.236 --> 30:21.572
You took the oath. You can't leave.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.699
- I have to.
- You can't.

30:23.866 --> 30:26.159
- You said the words.
- I don't care about...

30:26.285 --> 30:29.413
"Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow..."

30:29.496 --> 30:33.750
- To hell with all of you.
- "Night gathers and now my watch begins.

30:33.876 --> 30:37.004
"It shall not end until my death.

30:37.129 --> 30:39.089
"I shall live and die at my post."

30:39.214 --> 30:40.924
"I am the sword in the darkness..."

30:40.966 --> 30:42.801
"The watcher on the walls..."

30:42.968 --> 30:45.554
"The shield that guards the realms of men.

30:45.637 --> 30:49.308
"I pledge my life and honour
to the Night's Watch,

30:49.433 --> 30:53.103
"for this night and all nights to come."

31:32.726 --> 31:37.486
[Hash yer vineseri dothrakh ataki kishi, zhey shekh ma shieraki anni?]
Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars?

31:41.193 --> 31:45.794
[Hash yer laz chari anna; hash yer ray vos o, attihas anna.]
if you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me.

31:48.325 --> 31:53.205
[Yer lajak. Yer ayyeyoon lajakoon.]
You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter.

31:54.122 --> 31:56.625
[Anha zigerek yeroon lajat ajjin.]
I need you to fight now.

32:05.342 --> 32:09.680
[Affin shekh yola,]
I know you're very far away,

32:09.763 --> 32:14.601
[affin mae drae fey, shekh ma shieraki anni.]
but come back to me, my sun and stars.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.334
When the sun...

32:39.418 --> 32:41.920
rises in the west...

32:42.963 --> 32:45.424
...and sets in the east...

32:48.844 --> 32:52.055
...then you shall return to me,
my sun and stars.

33:59.456 --> 34:00.958
Kings?

34:01.875 --> 34:05.796
Oh, I can tell you all there is
to know about kings.

34:07.589 --> 34:10.926
The thing you need to understand
about kings is...

34:15.722 --> 34:19.685
For the past 6T years, I've known...

34:19.768 --> 34:24.648
truly known...
more kings than any man alive.

34:26.358 --> 34:30.737
They're complicated men,
but I know how to serve them.

34:30.821 --> 34:32.781
Yes.

34:32.864 --> 34:35.284
And keep on serving them.

34:37.661 --> 34:39.788
Aerys Targaryen.

34:41.706 --> 34:46.210
Of all the thousand thousand maladies
the gods visit on us...

34:47.254 --> 34:49.505
madness is the worst.

34:50.632 --> 34:52.551
He was a good man.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.679
Such a charmer.

34:56.804 --> 34:59.391
To watch him melt away before my eyes...

35:00.350 --> 35:04.855
consumed by dreams of fire and blood...

35:07.900 --> 35:11.612
Robert Baratheon
was an entirely different animal -

35:11.737 --> 35:14.406
powerful man, great warrior -

35:15.449 --> 35:20.495
but alas, winning a kingdom
and ruling a kingdom

35:20.621 --> 35:22.873
are rather different things.

35:22.956 --> 35:24.458
They say that...

35:24.583 --> 35:28.045
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

35:28.170 --> 35:33.509
he can often be blind
to the enemies at his side.

35:34.343 --> 35:38.180
Now I serve his son...

35:39.014 --> 35:40.682
King Joffrey...

35:41.308 --> 35:43.352
may the gods bless his reign.

35:44.728 --> 35:48.690
He is a capable young man -
strong military mind.

35:49.525 --> 35:50.901
Stern.

35:51.944 --> 35:55.322
But sternness in defence of the realm
is no vice.

35:57.199 --> 36:01.328
It's far too soon to know
what manner of king he will be, but...

36:01.453 --> 36:07.459
I sense true greatness on the horizon
for our new king.

36:07.626 --> 36:09.211
Mmm.

36:09.336 --> 36:11.588
True greatness.

36:15.968 --> 36:17.886
So what's the thing?

36:19.888 --> 36:21.348
What thing?

36:21.431 --> 36:23.225
About kings.

36:23.350 --> 36:27.145
You said, "The thing you
need to understand about kings..."

36:27.187 --> 36:29.147
What? Things? What?

36:29.189 --> 36:32.317
When you started, you...
Never mind.

36:32.401 --> 36:35.904
Let me see you out, my dear.

36:35.988 --> 36:38.991
- It's all right. No need.
- Yes, yes.

36:39.074 --> 36:41.159
Till the next time.

37:01.763 --> 37:03.223
Right.

37:29.750 --> 37:32.878
When you imagine yourself up there,
how do you look?

37:33.462 --> 37:35.297
Does the crown fit?

37:35.380 --> 37:37.633
Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow,

37:37.758 --> 37:40.719
the ones who sneered at you for years?

37:40.802 --> 37:44.181
It's hard for them to simper and bow
without heads.

37:45.682 --> 37:47.768
A man with great ambition and no morals -

37:47.893 --> 37:50.479
I wouldn't bet against you.

37:51.438 --> 37:56.527
And what would you do, my friend,
if you found yourself sitting up there?

37:56.652 --> 38:00.030
I must be one of the few men in this city
who doesn't want to be King.

38:00.197 --> 38:03.700
You must be one of the few men in the city
who isn't a man.

38:03.825 --> 38:05.410
Oh, you can do better than that.

38:09.998 --> 38:13.377
When they castrated you,
did they take the pillar with the stones?

38:13.460 --> 38:15.295
- I've always wondered.
- Have you?

38:15.420 --> 38:18.590
Do you spend a lot of time
wondering what's between my legs?

38:18.674 --> 38:23.804
I picture... a gash. Like a woman's.
Is that about right?

38:23.887 --> 38:26.765
I am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.

38:26.890 --> 38:30.686
Must be strange for you,
even after all these years...

38:31.562 --> 38:33.605
a man from another land,

38:33.730 --> 38:36.024
despised by most,

38:36.191 --> 38:37.401
feared by all...

38:37.484 --> 38:39.111
Am I? That is good to know.

38:39.194 --> 38:42.573
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

38:42.614 --> 38:44.741
But you carry on...

38:44.825 --> 38:48.912
whispering in one king's ear
and then the next.

38:51.164 --> 38:52.958
I admire you.

38:53.041 --> 38:56.336
And I admire you, Lord Baelish.

38:56.461 --> 39:00.883
A grasper from a minor House with
a major talent for befriending powerful men...

39:00.966 --> 39:04.011
- and women.
- A useful talent, I'm sure you'd agree.

39:06.597 --> 39:08.348
So...

39:08.473 --> 39:10.475
here we stand...

39:10.642 --> 39:13.061
in mutual admiration and respect.

39:13.270 --> 39:15.230
Playing our roles.

39:15.355 --> 39:16.690
Serving a new king.

39:16.732 --> 39:19.109
Long may he reign.

39:19.234 --> 39:21.361
- My king.
- My king.

39:22.696 --> 39:25.782
My lords. Shall we begin?

39:26.909 --> 39:28.702
You're Arry now, hear me?

39:28.827 --> 39:30.746
Arry the orphan boy.

39:30.913 --> 39:35.501
No one asks an orphan too many questions,
cos nobody gives three shits.

39:35.667 --> 39:37.503
What's your name?

39:37.586 --> 39:38.795
Arry.

39:38.921 --> 39:42.508
You've a long way to travel,
and in bad company.

39:43.091 --> 39:46.803
I've 20 this time -
men and boys all bound for the Wall.

39:47.679 --> 39:50.182
Your lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons,

39:50.349 --> 39:53.560
and I didn't find no little lordlings
down there.

39:53.644 --> 39:54.978
This lot -

39:55.103 --> 39:58.941
half of them would turn you over to the king
quick as spit for a pardon.

39:59.107 --> 40:03.111
And the other half would do the same,
except they'd rape you first.

40:03.320 --> 40:07.783
So keep to yourself -
and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.

40:09.243 --> 40:11.537
You stay with this lot, boy.

40:11.662 --> 40:13.163
And stay...

40:13.288 --> 40:16.959
or I'll lock you in the back of the wagon
with these three.

40:21.672 --> 40:23.298
Watch yourself, midget.

40:24.925 --> 40:26.009
He's got a sword, this one.

40:26.176 --> 40:28.679
What's a gutter rat like you
doing with a sword?

40:28.846 --> 40:31.765
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

40:31.932 --> 40:33.475
He looks like a girl.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.686
I bet he stole that sword.

40:36.937 --> 40:38.146
Let's have a look.

40:40.816 --> 40:42.693
I could use me a sword like that.

40:42.818 --> 40:45.153
- Take it off him.
- Give it here, midget.

40:45.237 --> 40:48.031
Look at him.
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.

40:48.156 --> 40:49.992
I've seen him kick a boy to death.

40:50.033 --> 40:52.286
I knocked him down
and I kicked him in the balls

40:52.452 --> 40:54.663
and I kept kicking him
until he was dead.

40:54.746 --> 40:56.582
I kicked him all to pieces.

40:58.166 --> 41:01.211
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

41:01.295 --> 41:03.005
I'll give it to you.

41:03.046 --> 41:05.757
I already killed one fat boy.

41:05.883 --> 41:08.260
I bet you never killed anyone.

41:08.385 --> 41:11.096
I bet you're a liar. But I'm not.

41:11.221 --> 41:13.098
I'm good at killing fat boys.

41:13.182 --> 41:14.850
I like killing fat boys.

41:16.852 --> 41:19.021
You like picking on the little ones, do you?

41:19.062 --> 41:21.815
I've been hammering an anvil
these past 10 years.

41:21.982 --> 41:24.318
When I hit that steel, it sings.

41:24.818 --> 41:27.196
Are you gonna sing when I hit you?

41:33.785 --> 41:36.079
This is castle-forged steel.

41:36.163 --> 41:38.290
Where'd you steal it?

41:38.373 --> 41:41.084
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

41:41.210 --> 41:43.629
Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.

41:43.712 --> 41:47.090
They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen...

41:47.174 --> 41:48.634
murderers.

41:48.759 --> 41:52.054
- Which are you?
- Armourer's apprentice.

41:53.514 --> 41:57.226
But my master got sick of me, so...
here I am.

41:57.267 --> 42:00.437
Come on, you sorry sons of whores!

42:00.646 --> 42:03.857
It's a thousand leagues from here
to the Wall!

42:03.941 --> 42:06.401
And winter is coming!

42:37.349 --> 42:39.226
Ham.

42:39.309 --> 42:44.189
How many days in a row must a man
be expected to start his day with ham?

42:45.065 --> 42:47.067
Bring me some beer at least.

42:49.194 --> 42:51.113
You look exhausted.

42:51.238 --> 42:53.240
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

42:56.994 --> 42:58.787
Don't look so terrified.

42:58.954 --> 43:01.540
If we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

43:01.665 --> 43:04.376
only ghosts would guard the Wall.

43:05.210 --> 43:07.838
At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.

43:08.839 --> 43:10.591
Honour made you leave,

43:10.674 --> 43:12.384
honour brought you back.

43:13.427 --> 43:15.429
My friends brought me back.

43:16.346 --> 43:18.515
I didn't say it was your honour.

43:19.641 --> 43:23.270
- They killed my father.
- And you're gonna bring him back to life?

43:23.395 --> 43:25.522
No? Good.

43:25.647 --> 43:28.358
We've had enough of that sort of thing.

43:29.484 --> 43:34.156
Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are
reporting whole villages abandoned.

43:34.239 --> 43:37.326
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

43:37.409 --> 43:39.578
from dusk until dawn.

43:39.661 --> 43:44.124
A captured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

43:44.291 --> 43:47.794
to what ends the gods only know.

43:48.795 --> 43:51.215
Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men

43:51.298 --> 43:53.550
discovered four blue-eyed corpses.

43:53.675 --> 43:57.721
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

43:59.932 --> 44:05.479
Do you think your brother's war
is more important than ours?

44:06.813 --> 44:07.814
No.

44:07.940 --> 44:11.735
When dead men and worse
come hunting for us in the night,

44:11.818 --> 44:15.739
do you think it matters
who sits on the Iron Throne?

44:16.573 --> 44:18.909
- No.
- Good.

44:19.034 --> 44:21.662
Because I want you
and your wolf with us

44:21.787 --> 44:24.706
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

44:25.374 --> 44:27.417
Beyond the Wall?

44:27.543 --> 44:30.546
I'll not sit meekly by...
and wait for the snows.

44:31.421 --> 44:33.590
I mean to find out what's happening.

44:34.550 --> 44:36.635
The Night's Watch will ride in force

44:36.718 --> 44:40.931
against the wildlings, the white walkers
and whatever else is out there.

44:43.767 --> 44:46.311
And we will find Benjen Stark,

44:46.436 --> 44:47.980
alive or dead.

44:49.189 --> 44:51.149
I will command them myself.

44:52.234 --> 44:54.820
So I'll only ask you once, Lord Snow...

44:55.821 --> 44:56.780
Move out!

44:56.864 --> 44:59.491
...are you a brother of
the Night's Watch

44:59.575 --> 45:03.203
or a bastard boy
who wants to play at war?

45:36.361 --> 45:38.947
Is this your command, Khaleesi?

45:46.079 --> 45:49.499
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs
in the Night Lands.

45:49.625 --> 45:54.713
Sell them. You can return to the free cities
and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

45:54.838 --> 45:56.882
They were not given to me to sell.

46:03.138 --> 46:05.474
Khaleesi, my Queen...

46:06.767 --> 46:09.061
I vow to serve you, obey you,

46:09.186 --> 46:11.063
to die for you if need be...

46:12.147 --> 46:14.483
but let him go, Khaleesi.

46:14.608 --> 46:16.777
I know what you intend. Do not.

46:16.860 --> 46:18.570
I must.

46:19.655 --> 46:21.823
You don't understand...

46:21.949 --> 46:25.869
Don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

46:25.994 --> 46:27.746
I won't watch you burn.

46:29.373 --> 46:31.416
Is that what you fear?

46:50.686 --> 46:52.896
You will be my khalasar.

46:54.731 --> 46:57.109
I see the faces of slaves.

46:58.235 --> 46:59.611
I free you.

47:00.571 --> 47:04.658
Take off your collars.
Go if you wish, no one will stop you.

47:04.741 --> 47:06.285
But if you stay...

47:07.286 --> 47:10.914
it will be as brothers and sisters,

47:10.998 --> 47:13.292
as husbands and wives.

47:25.053 --> 47:27.514
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.

47:30.225 --> 47:32.102
You swore to obey me.

47:41.195 --> 47:44.072
I am Daenerys Stormborn...

47:44.823 --> 47:46.992
of House Targaryen...

47:47.075 --> 47:48.994
of the blood of old Valyria.

47:49.077 --> 47:51.872
I am the Dragon's Daughter.

47:51.997 --> 47:54.333
And I swear to you...

47:54.374 --> 47:58.170
that those who would harm you
will die screaming.

47:58.295 --> 48:00.964
- You will not hear me scream.
- I will.

48:03.759 --> 48:05.802
But it is not your screams I want.

48:07.429 --> 48:08.889
Only your life.

50:39.498 --> 50:41.248
Blood of my blood.

51:28.168 --> 51:34.728
OMG, DRAGONS! THREE DRAGONS, MAN!! THREE FUCKING DRAGONS!!!
