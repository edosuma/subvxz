<i>Strike Back...</i>

00:01.804 --> 00:03.805
A new computer
hacker just came to town.

00:03.806 --> 00:05.006
Julian Buckley.

00:09.708 --> 00:11.968
Scott goes in
there as Buckley, unarmed.

00:11.993 --> 00:14.410
Have you had any
contact with this man?

00:14.435 --> 00:16.059
Who may be allied
with Latif.

00:17.158 --> 00:18.358
Not pretty enough for you?

00:20.097 --> 00:21.507
I'm telling
you everything I know.

00:21.532 --> 00:23.279
I just want to know that my
family are going to be safe.

00:23.304 --> 00:25.128
What happened out there,
happened because of us.

00:25.153 --> 00:26.353
There is no "us."

00:26.378 --> 00:27.682
You're not
Julian Buckley.

00:27.707 --> 00:28.907
You're a fucking liar.

00:28.932 --> 00:31.987
And fucking liars
all get the same treatment

00:32.012 --> 00:33.212
Fuck you!

00:44.160 --> 00:46.197
- Stonebridge?
- I'm going in.

00:46.231 --> 00:47.632
No! Fall Back!

00:47.666 --> 00:49.301
Repeat! Fall Back!

00:50.604 --> 00:52.105
It's Connolly.

01:24.545 --> 01:26.514
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:26.548 --> 01:29.484
Ah, it was just a bit of fun.

01:29.519 --> 01:32.523
We have the charge set to
explode away from your body.

01:32.557 --> 01:36.628
Not that you knew that,
which was the fun part.

01:43.336 --> 01:45.571
Ugh.

01:46.873 --> 01:49.841
Oh. Oh...

01:53.112 --> 01:54.145
Ow.

01:55.481 --> 01:56.748
No calls.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.984
You didn't even
go for your phone?

02:00.186 --> 02:02.989
You strapped a fucking
bomb to my chest.

02:03.023 --> 02:04.924
Who am I going to call?

02:04.959 --> 02:08.695
My Mom...ask her to
defuse the fucking thing?

02:12.301 --> 02:14.936
You sick fuck!

02:14.971 --> 02:16.171
Scott's alive!

02:16.206 --> 02:18.474
<i>Wait, Scott's alive.</i>

02:20.143 --> 02:21.344
Mmm.

02:34.425 --> 02:35.992
Well, you passed.

02:36.027 --> 02:37.728
Oh?

02:37.762 --> 02:41.565
And now it's time to
claim your prize.

02:44.636 --> 02:46.638
Just the one, mind...

02:55.349 --> 02:56.850
Show him.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.052
Come on.

03:00.589 --> 03:01.790
Oh.

03:06.263 --> 03:07.864
Colonel?

03:15.707 --> 03:17.408
Look, Kate, one day you're
gonna be where I am...

03:17.443 --> 03:20.579
And you're gonna have to make
these decisions for yourself.

03:20.613 --> 03:26.153
I knew Connolly would vet Scott,
in the most extreme manner.

03:26.187 --> 03:31.058
I told Scott that he was
not to flinch in any way.

03:31.092 --> 03:33.427
Not to make a play.
Not to call for help...

03:33.462 --> 03:35.696
Even if he thought,
he was going to die.

03:36.765 --> 03:39.600
Did you order him to go in?

03:39.635 --> 03:42.704
I gave him
an informed choice.

03:42.738 --> 03:44.038
He volunteered...

03:44.073 --> 03:46.741
Knowing exactly how dangerous
Daniel Connolly is.

03:48.377 --> 03:50.478
Do you have previous
with Connolly?

03:52.748 --> 03:56.217
Northern Ireland
was my first posting.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.254
I'd been there
three days when...

04:00.289 --> 04:02.890
Connolly broke into the
home of a delivery guy.

04:02.924 --> 04:05.826
He delivered groceries
to the barracks.

04:08.230 --> 04:10.465
Connolly tied up the man's
family in the front room...

04:10.499 --> 04:16.036
And told the guy that if he didn't drive a
lorry full of Semtex into the barracks...

04:16.072 --> 04:18.839
That he would kill his
family in front of him.

04:18.874 --> 04:21.209
But, if he did
what he was told...

04:21.244 --> 04:26.147
Connolly promised to spare the
lives of his wife and children.

04:26.181 --> 04:31.219
The explosion killed five
soldiers, and maimed dozens.

04:31.253 --> 04:33.054
I was the first
on the scene.

04:34.089 --> 04:36.091
And the man's family?

04:38.761 --> 04:42.864
Daniel Connolly is not a
man to keep his promises.

06:32.010 --> 06:34.979

06:56.667 --> 06:58.201
Not your concern.

06:58.236 --> 07:01.338
Cracking the access

07:14.051 --> 07:15.752
You okay with that?

07:17.054 --> 07:18.360
Yeah, well...

run some checks at my place.

07:29.466 --> 07:32.535

before you...

07:32.569 --> 07:34.637
The other codes
he was working on.

Hey. You can take this
shiny stuff. Nothing else.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.048
I want you back
at the bar in two.

08:24.688 --> 08:26.355
<i>Stonebridge.</i>

08:26.390 --> 08:28.391
Do we have a visual
on Scott yet?

08:28.425 --> 08:30.626
<i>Affirmative.
</i> <i>Is he okay?</i>

08:39.467 --> 08:41.135
I think he'll
come through.

08:41.136 --> 08:44.705
Fuck.

08:44.739 --> 08:45.906
Oh!

08:47.976 --> 08:52.213
Kate... I've been looking
into ATAT, like you asked.

08:52.247 --> 08:53.414
Read this.

10:13.397 --> 10:15.832
You look like shit.

10:16.733 --> 10:18.167
Yeah...

10:18.201 --> 10:19.902
They fucking blew
me up, dickhead.

10:19.937 --> 10:22.638
Sorry, I look fucking bad.

10:34.851 --> 10:38.321
You know, I've met some sick
mother fuckers in my time.

10:38.355 --> 10:40.122
Daniel Connolly...

10:40.157 --> 10:41.924
I'm fine, by the
way, thanks for asking.

10:41.959 --> 10:43.392
Oh, sorry about that mate.
How you feeling? You all right?

10:43.393 --> 10:44.191
Fuck you.

10:44.194 --> 10:45.762
I saw what
happened back there.

10:45.796 --> 10:47.397
Oh, you saw that, did
you? Did you learn anything?

10:47.431 --> 10:49.065
- You're reckless, Scott.
- Excuse me?

10:49.100 --> 10:50.425
She's a fucking
terrorist.

10:50.426 --> 10:52.780
Yeah, no fucking shit. Don't worry
about me, buddy. I'll do my job.

10:53.137 --> 10:55.004
- Really? You gonna put a bullet in her?
- Yeah, if I have to...

10:55.039 --> 10:56.940
She's the bad guy. You're the one
that's banging one of the Home Team.

10:56.974 --> 10:58.942
Look, I told you, Kate and I is
none of your fucking business.

10:58.976 --> 11:01.644
It fucking is if it's going
to get me killed out there!

11:01.678 --> 11:05.548
Sort your shit out, Michael.
For your sake. For Kate's...

11:05.583 --> 11:09.519
Especially for Kerry's.
Your wife? Remember her?

11:16.525 --> 11:17.826
You see Scott
do this from memory?

11:17.860 --> 11:19.594
No, he only had
eyes on them for seconds.

11:19.628 --> 11:21.996
Looks like it relates
to the same site.

11:22.030 --> 11:25.166
One appears to overlay the other.
Mmm-hmm.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.168
If this is an
ATAT facility...

11:27.202 --> 11:30.205
There'll be anti-ram barriers,
acoustic, infrared sensors...

11:30.239 --> 11:32.474
Ballistic-resistant entry
points. You name it...

11:32.508 --> 11:34.509
Not to mention, more guards
than even Connolly could kill.

11:34.544 --> 11:38.247
This looks like some sort of
tunnel system, running underneath.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.549
Scott said the maps
looked much older.

11:40.583 --> 11:42.718
So, this structure could
have been there for years...

11:42.752 --> 11:44.686
Decommissioned,
forgotten about...

11:44.721 --> 11:46.922
Well, whatever and
wherever this is...

11:46.956 --> 11:49.390
- Connolly's going in by the back door...
- Mmm-hmm.

11:49.425 --> 11:51.359
Try again.

11:51.393 --> 11:57.966
All right. Root,
at 10, dot...

11:58.000 --> 12:01.268
105...

12:01.303 --> 12:06.140
Dot, 0, dot, 57...

12:06.175 --> 12:11.212
M-K, D-I-R, dot.

12:14.016 --> 12:16.851
No. That's not right...
Ugh.

12:16.886 --> 12:18.887
Try again.

12:18.921 --> 12:20.088
All right, uh...

12:20.123 --> 12:22.024
We have documents
dating back to 2003...

12:22.059 --> 12:24.160
- Now, take a look at this.
- Excuse me, sir.

12:24.194 --> 12:26.096
No, not right now.

12:28.032 --> 12:30.500
Mahmood. Pakistani
weapons scientist.

12:30.534 --> 12:33.036
We know what length Latif went
to capture and interrogate her.

12:33.071 --> 12:38.343
Now, it turns out... That up until 2003,
she's on ATAT's payroll.

12:38.377 --> 12:41.847
Mahmood and Bratton.
It's in Baghdad in 2003.

12:41.881 --> 12:43.982
Days before Porter
got him out of there.

12:45.484 --> 12:47.753
Now, what if, right?

12:47.787 --> 12:52.957
Bratton and ATAT intended on planting
a chemical weapons stock, in Iraq?

12:52.992 --> 12:57.429
Giving the Pentagon hawks what they wanted
and making a killing when the war started.

13:00.099 --> 13:01.666
Shit.

13:01.701 --> 13:03.835
If what you're saying is right,
there's been a huge conspiracy, here.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.404
And some very influential
people will go a long way...

13:05.438 --> 13:08.205
To make sure none of
this ever comes out.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.440
Where are we?

13:09.474 --> 13:12.743
Scott saw the code that
Connolly's hacker used.

13:12.778 --> 13:14.345
Right. Do we know
what it was?

13:14.379 --> 13:17.281
No. We have the data,
and we have the device.

13:17.316 --> 13:19.450
But, we also need the
initialization protocol...

13:19.484 --> 13:22.219
That they used to hack
into ATAT's security system.

13:22.253 --> 13:24.121
Can we use it to hack?

13:24.155 --> 13:25.656
Only if we get
the exact code.

13:25.690 --> 13:27.591
One wrong character and
it's completely useless...

13:27.626 --> 13:29.694
Oh, come on, having a
photographic memory...

13:29.728 --> 13:31.001
And trying to remember
all this shit's

13:31.026 --> 13:32.918
really fucking hard
with you people talking.

13:33.399 --> 13:35.699
Shut the fuck up!

13:37.035 --> 13:40.070
<i>The guy before you,</i>
<i>he was working on it.</i>

13:40.104 --> 13:42.005
Try this...

13:42.040 --> 13:44.908
D-I-R...

13:47.178 --> 13:50.614
Slash, root at 10...

13:52.550 --> 13:54.818
Dot, 105...

13:56.787 --> 14:02.458
Dot, 0, dot, 57.

14:03.960 --> 14:04.994
We're in.

14:05.028 --> 14:06.195
Well done.

14:06.230 --> 14:09.065
Fuck yeah. Did
you see that?

14:46.340 --> 14:48.875
We've implanted a worm
on this hard drive.

14:48.910 --> 14:51.844
Scott needs to open the system
with the drive and the code...

14:51.879 --> 14:55.282
The worm will then allow me to remotely
bypass the proprietary firewall...

14:55.316 --> 14:56.783
And work on the
system from here.

14:56.818 --> 15:00.253
Right. Only one problem,
dude. I don't speak "geek."

15:00.288 --> 15:03.223
You just remember the code.
Leave the rest to me.

15:03.257 --> 15:05.025
But, you will need
to buy me some time.

15:05.059 --> 15:06.593
Yeah, how much?

15:06.628 --> 15:08.562
A few seconds.

15:08.597 --> 15:12.133
Shouldn't be a problem for Damien
Scott, world-class bull shitter.

15:12.167 --> 15:13.735
So that opens the vault?

15:13.769 --> 15:17.373
No, hacking into the system will
bypass the base site security.

15:17.407 --> 15:18.908
And avoid
triggering the alarm.

15:18.942 --> 15:20.309
Right.

15:20.344 --> 15:22.478
All right. How do we
get in the vault?

15:22.513 --> 15:24.480
Hmm. Most likely
a biometric key.

15:24.514 --> 15:26.149
Retinal scan,
fingerprint match...

15:26.183 --> 15:28.751
From a high-ranking
executive, like...

15:28.785 --> 15:30.253
Kenneth Bratton.

15:30.287 --> 15:33.656
All right, I'm outta here.

15:39.429 --> 15:40.796
Hello?

15:40.831 --> 15:43.733
<i>It's Ken</i>
<i>Bratton. I need to see you.</i>

15:43.767 --> 15:46.369
I can't speak
over the phone.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.738
We have to
meet. Somewhere safe.

15:52.443 --> 15:54.010
Looking forward to
that drink together?

15:54.044 --> 15:55.244
What drink?

15:55.279 --> 15:57.547
<i>She's here. Gotta go.</i>

16:00.384 --> 16:02.018
Hey.
Hey.

16:02.986 --> 16:05.153
Where's everyone else?

16:05.188 --> 16:06.922
Busy.

16:06.956 --> 16:07.957
Right.

16:07.991 --> 16:09.692
What are you
worried about?

16:09.727 --> 16:11.794
I'm on orders to
keep you relaxed.

16:11.828 --> 16:13.028
Mmm.

16:14.865 --> 16:17.500
Bratton's scared. He wants
to meet in a public place.

16:19.402 --> 16:20.669
You think he's
telling the truth?

16:20.703 --> 16:23.171
I do, yeah. This is
about his children.

16:24.674 --> 16:26.775
You know, Colonel, if we're
right, and bring Bratton in...

16:26.809 --> 16:28.343
This puts an end
to Connolly's plan.

16:28.377 --> 16:30.244
You could pull
Scott out.

16:30.279 --> 16:32.046
Captain, nothing would
give me greater pleasure

16:32.071 --> 16:33.732
than chopping
Connolly off at the knees.

16:34.282 --> 16:38.218
But his plan needs to succeed,
if he is to lead us to Latif.

16:38.252 --> 16:40.820
Connolly could be coming
for Bratton at any time.

16:40.854 --> 16:43.990
I want you to extract
him quickly and quietly.

16:44.024 --> 16:45.758
So, we can brief him...

16:45.792 --> 16:48.728
And put him back to work with
Connolly, under our protection.

16:48.762 --> 16:51.230
I want...you're his contact,
you're running point.

16:51.264 --> 16:52.264
Yeah.

16:52.299 --> 16:53.399
Okay.

16:53.433 --> 16:56.202
Copy that. Kate...

16:56.236 --> 16:58.537
Let me get in close.
You run point.

16:58.572 --> 16:59.772
He asked for me.

16:59.806 --> 17:01.607
No, I... I know he did, but...

17:01.642 --> 17:02.808
But, what?

17:04.511 --> 17:06.846
Scott told me about Connolly.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.714
If something goes wrong, or it's a trap...
Michael...

17:08.749 --> 17:10.550
I don't need you protecting me.
Look, I know...

17:10.584 --> 17:13.051
You don't need me
protecting you.

17:13.086 --> 17:14.520
But, I care about you.

17:20.661 --> 17:21.861
I know.

17:45.053 --> 17:46.987
<i>Lovely family, Ken.</i>

17:47.022 --> 17:49.090
<i>I can't</i>
<i>speak over the phone.</i>

17:49.124 --> 17:51.192
<i>We have to meet.</i>

17:51.227 --> 17:53.495
<i>I just want to know that my</i>
<i>family are going to be safe.</i>

18:01.938 --> 18:03.705
You wanted to
see me, Ken?

18:05.374 --> 18:07.542
Darrin, there are certain
things I need to tell you.

18:09.945 --> 18:12.280
Oh, fuck me!

18:12.315 --> 18:15.149
Please. Please, please, please.
Just stop, stop, stop...

18:15.183 --> 18:18.852
Oh, fuck! Oi!

18:19.888 --> 18:24.057
Oh, God, oh...

18:24.926 --> 18:28.328
Oi. Wow.

18:30.164 --> 18:32.932
That was amazing.

18:32.967 --> 18:35.201
You really know what
you're doing, huh?

18:35.236 --> 18:40.740
I trained for two years.
Pleasure and pain. That's me.

18:40.774 --> 18:42.742
You know, if you're
that good at something...

18:42.777 --> 18:44.744
Nobody wants to pay
for a massage...

18:44.779 --> 18:46.279
Not since the
credit crunch.

18:49.150 --> 18:53.887
So, uh, you just become
some terrorist groupie?

18:53.921 --> 18:55.121
Hmm?

18:56.323 --> 18:58.959
You don't know Daniel.

18:58.993 --> 19:01.561
You don't see what he stands
for, what he believes in...

19:04.765 --> 19:07.800
Anyway, live
fast, die young...

19:07.834 --> 19:09.868
So, what happens
if you don't die?

19:12.739 --> 19:15.707
Who would you rather see in
the mirror in 20 years time?

19:17.576 --> 19:21.445
A happy masseuse with
a couple of kids...

19:21.480 --> 19:26.450
Or just some cold-hearted soulless
bitch with black holes for eyes?

19:26.485 --> 19:29.220
Hmm?
Fuck you.

19:32.491 --> 19:34.192
Yeah?

19:38.731 --> 19:41.400
So, how many people
have you killed?

19:47.974 --> 19:50.176
Where the fuck are they?

20:05.193 --> 20:06.826
Visual?

20:06.861 --> 20:09.795
<i>Principal. Visual clear.</i>
<i>Ready to transport.</i>

20:09.830 --> 20:11.864
Copy that. Initiating contact.

20:15.968 --> 20:17.380
Yeah?

20:17.381 --> 20:18.436
<i>Walk to the end of the street</i>

20:18.461 --> 20:19.661
<i>and take a right</i>
at the coffee shop.

20:20.472 --> 20:22.841
Wait for me
at the windows, outside.

20:33.220 --> 20:34.688
Mr. Bratton!

20:34.722 --> 20:35.922
Am I being followed?

20:35.957 --> 20:37.257
Relax, we're gonna
get you out of here.

20:37.292 --> 20:38.241
<i>What about my family?</i>

20:38.242 --> 20:39.293
<i>They're fine. You</i>
<i>need to come with me.</i>

20:39.318 --> 20:40.245
<i>Yeah, I have to know.</i>

20:40.246 --> 20:41.282
<i>I have</i>
<i>to know that they're safe.</i>

20:41.283 --> 20:42.483
<i>They'll be safe. We're fifty</i>
<i>yards from making that happen.</i>

20:44.265 --> 20:45.432
You just need
to come with me.

20:45.466 --> 20:46.900
<i>No! I need to</i>
<i>know that they are safe!</i>

20:46.934 --> 20:48.735
<i>Kenneth, I need</i>
<i>to get you into the car.</i>

20:48.769 --> 20:49.502
<i>Christ, how the</i>
<i>hell did I get into this?</i>

20:49.537 --> 20:50.437
Transport secured?

20:50.471 --> 20:51.971
Negative, walking away.

20:53.306 --> 20:56.241
No! You have no idea the
pressure we were under.

20:56.309 --> 20:59.011
They wanted...no, God knows they needed
to find chemical weapons in Iraq.

20:59.045 --> 21:00.945
Listen to me.
It was never supposed to be used.

21:00.980 --> 21:02.414
Get into the car, Kenneth!

21:02.448 --> 21:03.815
Kate, bring him back!

21:03.849 --> 21:05.350
That's why I hid it.

21:05.384 --> 21:07.586
Principal is not secure.
Repeat, principal is not secure.

21:07.620 --> 21:09.354
When I found out what this
damn thing could do... Okay...

21:09.389 --> 21:11.089
Millions of people with
just a few drops...

21:11.124 --> 21:12.224
Kate, what are you doing?

21:12.259 --> 21:13.659
Talking Sarin? Talking VX?

21:13.693 --> 21:15.094
Yes, but you must understand...
Then tell me about it...

21:15.128 --> 21:16.662
What the hell is going on?

21:21.035 --> 21:22.202
Move!

21:22.236 --> 21:24.204
What the hell is going on?

21:34.348 --> 21:36.216
Get down!

21:49.028 --> 21:50.529
Shit!

22:00.273 --> 22:03.141
Leave. We're moving now.

22:08.815 --> 22:12.117
It's true what they say.
You can take the girl out of Ireland...

22:24.530 --> 22:26.698
Connolly's is after a
chemical weapon for Latif.

22:26.733 --> 22:29.301
Sarin VX. That's
what Kate said.

22:29.336 --> 22:31.370
We have to get
our hands on it first.

22:31.404 --> 22:32.871
Kate?

22:32.906 --> 22:35.741
We do not deflect
from this mission.

22:35.775 --> 22:37.342
All right, we still have
Scott on the inside.

22:37.377 --> 22:39.411
And we have no way of
knowing where Kate is.

22:41.081 --> 22:42.647
That's not entirely
true, Colonel.

22:49.553 --> 22:53.489
Maintaining lock on
Scott's phone. Heading East.

22:55.492 --> 22:57.026
Signal is slow.

23:04.234 --> 23:05.935
Are you
fucking serious?

23:05.969 --> 23:07.403
Come on.

23:11.842 --> 23:14.144
Oh, very fucking sneaky.

23:14.178 --> 23:15.879
Nice.

23:15.913 --> 23:18.115
Why'd you change
the schedule?

23:18.149 --> 23:19.817
Are you getting cold feet?

23:24.990 --> 23:26.957
We've lost Scott's phone.

23:26.991 --> 23:28.105
I don't remember
giving you an order

23:28.130 --> 23:29.939
to put a tracking device
on Captain Marshall.

23:31.329 --> 23:32.896
Give them the
tracking reference.

23:32.930 --> 23:35.097
And then get out in the
field and find Kate.

23:35.132 --> 23:36.532
Yes, Ma'am.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.270
So, what is this place?

23:43.539 --> 23:45.107
Patience...

23:52.114 --> 23:54.182
How you holding up, Ken?

23:55.885 --> 23:57.552
I have a surprise for you.

24:15.573 --> 24:19.510
They've got my family!

24:19.544 --> 24:20.978
Now, come on Ken.

24:21.013 --> 24:23.147
Remember Ramadi?

24:23.181 --> 24:26.183
Remember the
lies I told for you?

24:26.217 --> 24:28.886
I put my neck on
the block for you.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.221
And just because
you've lost your balls...

24:30.255 --> 24:32.389
Doesn't mean you're going
to take me down with you.

24:49.874 --> 24:52.076
We've got Marshall's signal.

24:52.111 --> 24:54.312
It's the
same location as Scott.

24:55.314 --> 24:56.481
So...

24:57.616 --> 25:00.618
As we discussed...
Ken's not leaving?

25:01.687 --> 25:05.323
Nobody's leaving.

25:24.243 --> 25:26.845
Now, I've got to ask...

25:26.880 --> 25:29.882
What's a nice girl like you doing
working for the Colonial enemy?

25:29.950 --> 25:31.951
Spare me the
prehistoric shite.

25:31.985 --> 25:37.356
See, I think it's a childhood
thing, that you've, uh, never...

25:37.390 --> 25:40.125
Well, ya know... Playing soldiers in
the back garden with your brother...

25:40.160 --> 25:41.627
No...brothers...

25:43.663 --> 25:47.098
Always wanting to
be one of the lads.

25:47.133 --> 25:51.469
Enough about me. Did you always
want to be a cold-blooded butcher?

25:51.504 --> 25:55.373
No, it wasn't
my first calling...

25:56.642 --> 26:00.178
Don't tell me... You
want to become a priest.

26:00.212 --> 26:03.414
No, as a matter of fact...

26:05.117 --> 26:07.585
You know, I've never told
anyone this before...

26:09.254 --> 26:11.823
I always wanted
to be a jockey.

26:11.858 --> 26:13.191
On the level.

26:14.461 --> 26:17.730
When I was 15, I
jumped school, and...

26:17.764 --> 26:21.567
Hopped on a bus to Fermanagh
to work at a stable out there.

26:21.602 --> 26:26.006
You know, mucking out, grooming...
I even got to ride a couple of times.

26:27.708 --> 26:30.009
It was the greatest
week of my life.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.348
And then on a Saturday...

26:35.382 --> 26:38.651
The head lad calls
me in and says...

26:38.686 --> 26:40.820
"We have to let you go."

26:43.123 --> 26:44.757
Why was that?

26:47.461 --> 26:49.129
I frightened the horses.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.407
They're on the move.

26:58.441 --> 27:00.209
<i>Sending you co-ordinates.</i>

27:04.580 --> 27:06.181
So, basically,
we're just gambling...

27:06.215 --> 27:08.784
That Marshall will
be with Connolly.

27:08.818 --> 27:12.087
If she's still alive, it's because
Connolly has a use for her...

27:28.037 --> 27:30.405
We're getting
transmission interference.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.242
Her signal's down.
I'm patching through last coordinates.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.345
<i>Roger that. On my way.</i>

27:36.914 --> 27:39.316
According to Captain Marshall's
last known position...

27:39.350 --> 27:42.886
I think the tunnel's
under this facility.

27:42.921 --> 27:44.354
And what is it?

27:44.389 --> 27:47.991
It's a factory making fertilizers,
agricultural chemicals.

27:48.025 --> 27:49.359
A shell company for ATAT?

27:49.394 --> 27:50.995
A hiding place.

30:42.603 --> 30:44.071
You're on.

31:27.414 --> 31:29.148
Wanna give me
a bit of space?

31:31.685 --> 31:32.852
Please.

31:38.425 --> 31:44.297
<i>D-I-R, breaker,</i>
<i>at 10, dot 105...</i>

31:44.331 --> 31:47.500
<i>Dot, 0, 550...</i>

31:51.671 --> 31:53.305
Okay.

31:53.339 --> 31:55.073
Scott's online.
Okay. Here we go.

31:59.044 --> 32:00.511
The worm's not loading.

32:02.113 --> 32:06.917
Uh, all right.
Behind the doors. Access.

32:06.951 --> 32:08.886
<i>Voila.</i>

32:08.920 --> 32:11.621
What's the problem, Major?
I, I don't understand. It...

32:21.299 --> 32:23.667
Come on.

32:29.106 --> 32:30.273
Fuck.

32:30.307 --> 32:32.442
Fuck! It's not loading.

32:36.546 --> 32:39.315
Uh... I don't know
what's going on.

32:41.718 --> 32:45.354
Activated! Okay, okay.
The worm is uploading.

32:46.990 --> 32:48.492
Come on...

32:51.196 --> 32:52.396
Come on.

32:55.767 --> 32:56.834
Denied?

32:56.868 --> 32:58.736
Not denied.
Not recognized.

32:58.770 --> 33:01.572
Come on. Come on.
Work, damn it work!

33:01.607 --> 33:03.841
Have we a problem?

33:03.876 --> 33:06.544
Come on!

33:06.578 --> 33:09.147
The worm! It works!
Okay, I-D.

33:09.181 --> 33:12.484
Password, please. We're in.

33:18.058 --> 33:20.192
I never doubted you.

33:20.226 --> 33:23.327
Watch him. Come on.

33:51.491 --> 33:54.126
It's a bit late to
find your spine, Ken.

34:07.007 --> 34:08.641
This is nice...

34:30.264 --> 34:31.431
Open it.

35:11.473 --> 35:14.475
Do you have any
idea what that is?

35:14.510 --> 35:17.546
I haven't got a
fucking clue. Pack it.

35:17.580 --> 35:20.249
What're you gonna do?
You're gonna kill me?

35:20.283 --> 35:21.817
If that's what he
tells me to do.

35:22.952 --> 35:24.820
I'm on his side, remember?

35:24.854 --> 35:28.957
He's got no side. All right?
It's just him against everyone else!

35:37.900 --> 35:40.369
He's killing
everyone else.

35:41.370 --> 35:44.773
Think about it.

35:44.807 --> 35:48.009
Come on. As soon as I'm done
here, he's gonna kill me.

35:48.043 --> 35:51.779
Shut up! Shut
the fuck up!

35:56.752 --> 35:57.986
That's it.

35:58.020 --> 36:00.054
As soon as you're done,
he's gonna kill you.

36:00.089 --> 36:01.523
Who are you?

36:01.557 --> 36:03.858
Who the fuck are you?

36:03.892 --> 36:05.459
What about my family?

36:05.494 --> 36:08.396
You'll never know.

36:11.267 --> 36:13.000
They detected the worm.

36:15.537 --> 36:18.371
What the fuck!

36:18.406 --> 36:19.472
Fuck! No!

36:21.008 --> 36:22.141
No!

36:26.080 --> 36:27.547
Fuck me.

36:28.549 --> 36:29.616
You okay? Yeah?

36:29.651 --> 36:31.985
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. He's down here.

36:32.019 --> 36:33.887
Grenade!
Get down! Shit!

36:40.162 --> 36:41.496
Come on.

36:41.531 --> 36:43.565
Another grenade! Move!

36:47.269 --> 36:49.170
Connolly, drop your weapon!

36:50.806 --> 36:51.972
Coast clear.

36:52.007 --> 36:54.008
Capture, Michael, do
not fucking kill him!

36:54.042 --> 36:55.776
He's up,
he's up, come on!

37:03.618 --> 37:06.053
Connolly,
stop, don't move!

37:06.087 --> 37:09.490
Put the weapon
down, Connolly. Put it down!

37:09.525 --> 37:12.559
Put the fucking weapon down!
Put it down!

37:15.063 --> 37:16.230
Gently.

37:20.001 --> 37:22.370
Now, get on the ground.
On the ground.

37:22.404 --> 37:24.371
Come on, get on
your fucking knees!

37:24.406 --> 37:26.073
Get the fuck on the ground!

37:26.108 --> 37:28.576
Typical fucking British.
Always giving orders.

37:29.978 --> 37:31.546
On the ground.

37:34.216 --> 37:36.317
I think you should
look in the van, lads.

37:36.351 --> 37:38.953
Can't have too much insurance,
you know what I mean?

37:41.590 --> 37:43.023
Keep watching him.

37:44.526 --> 37:47.961
No, Michael, Michael!
Shit.

37:47.996 --> 37:49.763
Kate!

37:51.433 --> 37:52.633
It's all right.

37:57.171 --> 37:58.639
Okay.

38:01.442 --> 38:02.776
You like that?

38:02.810 --> 38:05.612
You fucking piece of shit!
Ahhh!

38:05.646 --> 38:07.914
It's your shot to
add the fucking point.

38:12.485 --> 38:13.718
Some of my best work.

38:13.753 --> 38:17.555
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

38:17.589 --> 38:19.256
We have an
anti-handling device.

38:19.290 --> 38:22.559
There's a tilt switch, yeah?
Yeah, that's right.

38:22.594 --> 38:26.430
That mercury moves, it'll detonate.
You have to stay still.

38:26.465 --> 38:28.766
These charges are shaped
to blow right towards you.

38:28.801 --> 38:31.969
Can you feel anything else?
Yeah, there's something, um...

38:32.004 --> 38:35.540
Uh, Cold... It's metal,
digging into my stomach.

38:35.574 --> 38:37.841
No, I can still cut
through this cable, here.

38:37.842 --> 38:39.169
- No, it's wired to the bomb.
- It's all right.

38:39.170 --> 38:39.912
- I can get this off of you.
- Michael...

38:39.913 --> 38:40.943
Michael...
I just have to see...

38:40.947 --> 38:43.715
Besides, we both know
there isn't any time!

38:46.019 --> 38:49.355
Switch it off. Switch
it fucking off!

38:49.390 --> 38:51.992
Yeah, I can switch it off...
But you'll have to let me go.

38:52.026 --> 38:53.427
No fucking way!

38:53.461 --> 38:54.762
You've won.

38:54.796 --> 38:57.231
You got your fucking
apocalypse back.

38:57.266 --> 39:00.401
Now, all I'm saying is, I can
disable that timer remotely.

39:00.435 --> 39:01.669
That is bullshit!

39:01.703 --> 39:03.137
But, I'll need
100 yards start.

39:03.205 --> 39:04.605
No, no, Michael!

39:06.942 --> 39:08.710
Oh, you think I haven't done
this sort of thing before?

39:08.744 --> 39:09.744
You fuck!

39:09.778 --> 39:12.113
Yeah, go ahead! Shoot me!

39:13.849 --> 39:14.915
Go on!

39:14.950 --> 39:16.350
He will not fucking do it!
Scott!

39:16.385 --> 39:17.919
Scott! We have to give
her a chance, man!

39:17.953 --> 39:19.921
There is no fucking chance!
And he's playing you!

39:19.955 --> 39:23.825
C'mon soldier. What other
choice do you have?

39:23.860 --> 39:25.927
Or maybe she's not worth it.

39:25.962 --> 39:27.629
Michael! Michael!

39:27.663 --> 39:28.864
Ah.

39:31.434 --> 39:34.270
Michael, he's a fucking liar.

39:34.304 --> 39:35.705
Tick, tock, lads.

39:35.739 --> 39:37.072
I can't let her die.

39:37.107 --> 39:38.541
- Tick, tock.
- He's not gonna do it.

39:38.575 --> 39:39.742
Michael!

39:41.512 --> 39:42.712
100 yards.

39:44.949 --> 39:46.082
Michael!

39:47.085 --> 39:48.385
That's all I need.

39:48.420 --> 39:51.622
Michael, he won't fucking do it.
Shut up, Scott.

39:51.656 --> 39:52.990
Michael, he's
fucking with you...

39:53.025 --> 39:54.526
Michael, no!

39:54.560 --> 39:56.494
- You will not get that bomb off her!
- Shut up.

39:58.231 --> 39:59.398
Promise.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.167
Shit.

40:04.304 --> 40:05.471
Fuck!

40:10.309 --> 40:11.376
We've got the weapon.

40:11.410 --> 40:12.677
What have you done?

40:12.711 --> 40:13.878
It's fine. We got the weapon.
What have you done?

40:13.913 --> 40:15.113
He promised!

40:20.452 --> 40:22.320
He promised.

40:25.824 --> 40:28.359
What have you done?
He promised.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.137
Bitch.

40:46.545 --> 40:47.846
Time to go.

40:50.215 --> 40:54.452
Michael, look at me.
Do you love me?

40:58.390 --> 41:01.359
Sergeant, you will
obey this order!

41:01.393 --> 41:04.094
I'm sorry, Kate.
Michael, get the fuck out.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.697
You always had my back.

41:05.731 --> 41:07.431
Come on! Move!

41:07.499 --> 41:09.266
- I'm sorry, Kate!
- Move!

41:09.300 --> 41:10.834
Come on!

41:12.904 --> 41:14.071
Kate!

41:19.445 --> 41:23.649
Kate! Kate!

42:16.605 --> 42:17.705
Yes?

42:17.739 --> 42:19.740
My friend, a
thousand apologies.

42:19.775 --> 42:23.311
Until now, he had
proved very reliable.

42:23.345 --> 42:28.148
The reputation of a man like
Connolly, relies on results.

42:28.183 --> 42:31.484
Let him know I'm
extremely disappointed.

42:31.519 --> 42:36.255
Of course. But, I assure you this
is only a temporary setback.

42:36.290 --> 42:38.524
Kwarfet's contact
is still in place.

42:38.558 --> 42:41.226
And I know where the remaining
stock can be found.

43:47.957 --> 43:49.758
Fellahs...

43:51.861 --> 43:53.195
What took you so long?

43:53.229 --> 43:55.863
Didn't seem like you
were going anywhere.

43:57.099 --> 43:58.700
You're right.

44:00.402 --> 44:03.304
I figured between
you and Latif...

44:05.006 --> 44:08.476
Ah, ugh... Got
tired of running.

44:14.784 --> 44:17.454
Sorry about your friend...

44:17.488 --> 44:19.289
But you know how it is.

44:34.973 --> 44:40.643
I had a dream about
you, Eleanor. So I did...

44:40.711 --> 44:44.080
I'd like it to be you.
Soldier to Soldier.

44:47.985 --> 44:50.521
You were never a soldier.
