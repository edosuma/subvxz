37:52.100 --> 37:55.200
then you don't get to complain
if I don't do it right. No, no.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.467
You just don't, and if you don't
like that, next time,

37:57.467 --> 37:59.100
do it yourself.

38:00.467 --> 38:03.267
Claudia's mad.

38:03.267 --> 38:04.934
You know what amazes me?

38:04.934 --> 38:10.067
That I actually lived with a guy
who owned one pair of socks.

38:10.067 --> 38:11.701
Ray only had one pair of socks?
Yeah.

38:11.701 --> 38:13.200
And the rest
of his hygiene routine

38:13.200 --> 38:15.267
is completely consistent
with that.

[CHUCKLES]
MAN: Yo, Callie.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.167
[SIGHS]
Who's that?

38:22.167 --> 38:23.567
Spence Kramer.

38:23.567 --> 38:26.067
I made out with him
once last fall.

38:26.067 --> 38:28.801
Guess he heard about me and Ray.

38:28.801 --> 38:30.467
Well, here I go,

38:30.467 --> 38:31.767
back into the fire.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.467
Save my seat.

38:35.300 --> 38:36.667
Well...

38:36.667 --> 38:39.133
she certainly
bounces back fast.

38:39.133 --> 38:40.701
What's with you?

38:40.701 --> 38:41.834
Gee, I wonder.

38:41.834 --> 38:43.167
What? Callie?

38:43.167 --> 38:44.200
You're not actually mad

38:44.200 --> 38:45.968
'cause she's here, are you?

38:45.968 --> 38:48.133
Well, given that I didn't
want you living with her,

38:48.133 --> 38:49.801
do you really think
I want her around?

38:49.801 --> 38:52.667
Her boyfriend just broke up
with her, Sarah.

38:52.667 --> 38:53.968
Have a little compassion.

38:53.968 --> 38:55.033
[SCOFFS]

38:55.033 --> 38:56.234
It's amazing how you can make

38:56.234 --> 38:57.501
insensitivity sound so nice.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.300
I'm insensitive?

38:59.300 --> 39:01.267
Me?

39:02.934 --> 39:06.501
Man, Sarah,
I finally find a place,

39:06.501 --> 39:07.868
one that I can afford, with--

39:07.868 --> 39:09.968
With a roommate who actually
seems pretty cool,

39:09.968 --> 39:11.534
and you don't try
and enjoy it for me.

39:11.534 --> 39:13.400
Given the details,
can you blame me?

39:13.400 --> 39:15.000
Yes, I can,

39:15.000 --> 39:18.767
because I have never given you
a reason not to trust me, ever.

39:18.767 --> 39:20.467
So I really don't think
it's fair for you

39:20.467 --> 39:22.167
to guilt trip me like this
because I'm--

39:22.167 --> 39:23.834
Because I'm friends with my
roommate.

39:23.834 --> 39:25.167
So I'm supposed to be happy?

39:25.167 --> 39:26.467
Yes, you are.

39:26.467 --> 39:28.234
And if you can't be happy,

39:28.234 --> 39:29.767
then you should fake it.

[GIGGLES]

[SIGHS]

39:47.667 --> 39:49.567
Come on, let's go.

39:49.567 --> 39:50.567
Oh, hey.

39:50.567 --> 39:53.033
Hey, Coop. Julia.

39:53.033 --> 39:54.033
Hey.

39:54.033 --> 39:56.400
We were just gonna eat.

39:58.033 --> 40:00.300
You guys--?

40:00.300 --> 40:01.334
You wanna join us?

40:03.767 --> 40:05.534
Yeah.
Sure.

40:05.534 --> 40:06.667
Thanks.

40:18.767 --> 40:20.968
Hey.
CHARLIE: Hey.

40:23.033 --> 40:24.868
I was thinking, um,

40:24.868 --> 40:27.234
you know those awards shows?

40:27.234 --> 40:29.534
Like the Academy Awards or--?

40:29.534 --> 40:30.868
Or the Grammys?

40:30.868 --> 40:32.934
You know how at those things
they always give out

40:32.934 --> 40:36.701
like a special prize to somebody
who overcame a tragedy?

40:36.701 --> 40:38.200
Yeah.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.100
And the tragedy person
always says,

40:40.100 --> 40:42.701
"Most of all,
I-I'd like to thank my wife,

40:42.701 --> 40:45.200
without whom
I never would've made it."

40:47.434 --> 40:50.234
Do you think it's easy
for those wives or husbands?

40:50.234 --> 40:52.934
I mean, do you think
being so supportive

40:52.934 --> 40:54.834
just comes naturally to them?

40:54.834 --> 40:56.667
Well...

40:56.667 --> 40:58.934
I doubt it's easy.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.868
But I-I bet if you love someone,

41:00.868 --> 41:02.801
it comes pretty naturally.

41:07.367 --> 41:09.801
Kirsten's not doing any better,
Jule.

41:11.267 --> 41:12.300
Really?

41:14.234 --> 41:17.367
Mornings are so-so,

41:17.367 --> 41:19.801
but afternoons and evenings

41:19.801 --> 41:21.567
are pretty unbearable, I guess.

41:23.300 --> 41:24.467
I talked to her doctor,

41:24.467 --> 41:26.968
and he said
she might be like this

41:26.968 --> 41:29.267
for a long time.

41:29.267 --> 41:30.934
Wow.

41:37.701 --> 41:40.334
So I-I guess you just

41:40.334 --> 41:42.767
hang in there.

41:42.767 --> 41:45.267
For how long?

41:45.267 --> 41:46.834
However long it takes.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.701
What if I can't?

41:51.901 --> 41:54.033
What do you mean?
Of course you can.

41:54.033 --> 41:56.334
You don't know that.

41:56.334 --> 41:57.567
Think about it. When--?

41:57.567 --> 42:00.367
When have I ever been good
about hanging in there?

42:00.367 --> 42:02.567
I mean, let's face it,
if there's one thing I suck at,

42:02.567 --> 42:04.067
it's the long haul.

42:04.067 --> 42:07.467
That i-is so not true, Charlie.

42:07.467 --> 42:09.701
I mean, you hung in there
for us.

42:09.701 --> 42:12.734
Barely, and only 'cause
I didn't have a choice.

You know what I think
this is like?

42:27.033 --> 42:29.033
This is like
when we were little,

42:29.033 --> 42:31.868
and we packed for
our summer camping trips.

42:31.868 --> 42:34.601
And I'd get out
all my camping clothes

42:34.601 --> 42:37.367
from the year before
and try them on.

42:37.367 --> 42:41.067
Heh. And each year

42:41.067 --> 42:42.400
I'd be really surprised

42:42.400 --> 42:43.467
that they were too small,

42:43.467 --> 42:45.200
'cause I hadn't even noticed

42:45.200 --> 42:46.567
that I'd grown.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.467
Maybe you've grown more than--
Than you've noticed.

I'm gonna wanna bail on her.
