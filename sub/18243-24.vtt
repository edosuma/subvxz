I bet they make people
tell the truth.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.012
[gasping]

00:12.099 --> 00:13.839
That truffle's not nearly
as tasty as it looks.

00:13.926 --> 00:15.319
Not your best work.

00:15.406 --> 00:16.886
Hannah: The first truffle
puts you under a spell,

00:16.973 --> 00:18.496
and the second one
breaks it.

00:18.583 --> 00:19.802
I'm going to
run for mayor.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.238
Wow, Mom, that's huge.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.631
May the best person win.

00:22.718 --> 00:25.634
That mall of yours
is about to get
a new restaurant.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.157
Fine, but you gotta
do something for me.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.638
I'm going to get
the mayor's endorsement,
don't worry.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.553

Hannah, your teacher is
the third protector.

Hannah:
What I don't get is why
he's cursing people.

Kelly: Not people,
protectors.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.044
- Mr. Morris:
You're dangerous.
- Huh?

00:44.131 --> 00:47.395
You are the ones
cursing everyone in town
to forget magic.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.834
What?

00:51.921 --> 00:55.142
We're not cursing people
to forget magic, you are.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.361
Why would you even
think that?

00:57.448 --> 00:59.146
Uh, because you have
a creepy folder

00:59.233 --> 01:00.886
full of names of
former protectors,

01:00.973 --> 01:03.193
and the ones who've
forgotten magic
have been crossed out.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.587
I was just keeping track of
the people that you cursed.

01:05.674 --> 01:08.851
After everything I've done
to un-curse my grandma,

01:08.938 --> 01:11.680
why would I
curse her again?

01:11.767 --> 01:14.291
Fine. Maybe you aren't
behind it,

01:14.378 --> 01:16.598
but you are still
irresponsible with
the magic.

01:16.685 --> 01:19.383
Hey, we do not use
the magic irresponsibly.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.298
Oh, really?
Where shall I begin?

01:21.385 --> 01:23.779
How about
magically locking me in
this house all night.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.259
And you,
Miss Parker-Kent,

01:25.346 --> 01:27.348
you came to school
under some kind of
attention spell,

01:27.435 --> 01:29.393
and then for your most
egregious use of magic,

01:29.480 --> 01:31.178
you froze the entire town.

01:31.265 --> 01:32.222
How do you know that?

01:32.309 --> 01:33.397
Are you denying it?

01:33.484 --> 01:35.573
I can see why Mr. Morris
intimidates you.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.358
That was to save
my grandma.

01:37.445 --> 01:39.708
Maybe you spelled
Noelle and RJ

01:39.795 --> 01:42.145
so that you were
the only protector
who remembers magic.

01:42.232 --> 01:43.625
Oh, that is
a lovely theory, Hannah,

01:43.712 --> 01:45.192
but for the fact that
I'm not a protector.

01:47.411 --> 01:48.673
You're not?

01:48.760 --> 01:50.893
But we saw a picture of you
with RJ and Noelle

01:50.980 --> 01:52.199
together in high school.

01:52.286 --> 01:55.724
Yeah, I knew them,
but I wasn't a protector.

01:55.811 --> 01:58.335
Wait, if you weren't
a protector,
how were you involved?

01:58.422 --> 01:59.902
[school bell rings]

01:59.989 --> 02:02.905
Mr. Morris: I was the one
keeping them out of trouble.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.994
They were always
in detention.

02:05.081 --> 02:06.691
RJ was the prankster
of the group.

02:11.392 --> 02:12.871
Then there was Noelle,

02:12.958 --> 02:14.743
who loved taking shortcuts.

02:19.748 --> 02:22.142
And then there was
Caroline.

02:22.229 --> 02:25.710
She was the ringleader,
rebellious and reckless.

02:25.797 --> 02:28.235
She was all trouble.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.672
Why were you in detention,
Mr. Morris?

02:30.759 --> 02:33.065
For writing
Caroline's essay.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.415
I'm not proud of it,

02:34.502 --> 02:36.982
but back then
we were friends.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.767
Or at least
I thought we were.

02:38.854 --> 02:42.945
Mr. Morris, if you're not
erasing people's memories
of magic,

02:43.032 --> 02:44.947
and we're not,

02:45.034 --> 02:46.209
then it has to be Caroline.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.909
That does make sense.

02:52.650 --> 02:53.651
Except for one thing.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.784
What's that?

02:55.871 --> 02:57.002
After we graduated
high school,

02:57.089 --> 02:59.614
Caroline
completely disappeared.

Is this about
your last paper?

03:53.015 --> 03:54.669
It's about Caroline.

extra hard on you.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.858
Well, I hope I passed.

Because I take my job as

That's why we're
working so hard to
solve this mystery

before anyone else
can get hurt.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.003
Can you tell me how
you got so involved?

04:25.090 --> 04:27.310
[sighs] Well, um,

04:27.397 --> 04:29.878
at the risk of
sounding immodest,

I was the smartest kid

and RJ wouldn't stop
talking about it,

04:42.543 --> 04:44.327
so Noelle and I cooked
a Shut Him Up Shortcake
recipe,

04:44.414 --> 04:45.763
and now RJ can't talk
and I can't stop,

04:45.850 --> 04:47.548
and it's really crazy
'cause I feel like--

04:47.635 --> 04:49.071
You've gotta help us
undo this.

04:49.158 --> 04:50.551
I don't mind
RJ not talking,

04:50.638 --> 04:53.205
but Caroline is
driving me crazy.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.227

- What?

You can talk again.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.990
You're a genius.

05:42.907 --> 05:45.214
You put together that
Caroline needed to help
that boy

the cedronian downside.

from a heart that's true."

05:49.914 --> 05:51.307
Very impressive.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.527
Yeah, I figured that
they would learn from
that mistake,

05:53.614 --> 05:55.529
and be more careful
in the future.

05:55.616 --> 05:58.053
I couldn't have been
more wrong.

05:58.140 --> 06:01.012
But how is any of this
gonna help you find Caroline?

06:01.099 --> 06:02.971
I'm not sure.

06:03.058 --> 06:04.320
Yet.

bad protectors.

07:13.563 --> 07:15.217
Why did the book
even choose them?

07:15.304 --> 07:17.219
Maybe it's because
Grandma threw the book
over the falls

07:17.306 --> 07:18.742
before it was ready
to move on.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.875

messed things up.

Mr. Morris at the debate.

Don't remind me
about the debate.

the Bitter Truth Truffles

07:37.326 --> 07:38.414

It'll force him to
tell the truth.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.538
[inhales]
Thanks.

09:42.625 --> 09:43.670
I feel better.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.454
Except I still can't
feel my feet.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.934
Who needs 'em?
Come on.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.892
I want to go over
a few last minute items.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.590
[sighs] Okay.

09:50.677 --> 09:51.895
- Good luck, Mom.
- Thanks.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.420
Oh, there's
Mr. Morris.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.991
Ladies.
You ready for
the debate?

10:01.078 --> 10:04.516
It should be
interesting.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.170
Mr. Morris,
we were wondering

10:06.257 --> 10:08.433
if there's anything more
you can tell us about Caroline.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.826
The more information
we have on her,

10:09.913 --> 10:11.306
the greater chance we have
of finding her.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.308
I like the way you three
work together.

10:13.395 --> 10:16.833
Plus, your tenacity
is admirable.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.574
I must admit,

10:18.661 --> 10:21.316
you are very responsible
protectors.

10:21.403 --> 10:24.406
We try. So, um,
about Caroline?

10:24.493 --> 10:26.582
Well, Caroline was...

10:26.669 --> 10:28.018
fearless.

10:28.105 --> 10:30.064
She was always getting
the others into trouble.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.414
The three of them
hated taking tests,

10:32.501 --> 10:35.939
so Caroline
discovered a recipe for
Fill In The Bubble Gum.

10:40.509 --> 10:41.945
I remember one time

10:42.032 --> 10:44.339
RJ helped Caroline
get revenge on a teacher

10:44.426 --> 10:46.210
by making him
itch like crazy.

10:46.297 --> 10:47.603
Detention is over.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.474
Everyone go home.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.955
Wait. They invented
Itchy Ice Cream?

10:54.044 --> 10:56.264
Oh, no, am I the RJ
of the group?

10:56.351 --> 10:59.093
At first,
they mostly cooked
harmless pranks.

10:59.180 --> 11:02.052
But then Caroline got
more and more ambitious.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.663
Like the time she
wanted to look older

11:03.750 --> 11:06.317
so that she could get into
a dance club.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.755
She cooked a
Chameleon Cauliflower spell

11:08.842 --> 11:10.452
to completely change
her appearance.

11:14.543 --> 11:17.938
That is the coolest
spell ever.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.287
Oh, no, am I the Caroline
of the group?

11:19.374 --> 11:20.723
That's even worse.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.420
That was just
the tip of the iceberg.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.161
What else did she do?

11:24.248 --> 11:25.989
Well--

11:26.076 --> 11:27.687
Oh, the debate's
starting soon.

11:27.774 --> 11:28.644
I'll tell you more later.

11:31.647 --> 11:32.953
Woman: Mr. Lever,
if elected,

11:33.040 --> 11:34.911
what would you do
to stop crime?

11:34.998 --> 11:37.000
Well, that's
a great question, Paula.

11:37.087 --> 11:39.437
Uh, I honestly have
no idea what to do.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.004
[audience murmuring]

11:41.091 --> 11:44.529
Uh, best thing I can
come up with is, uh,

11:44.616 --> 11:46.096
for every family
and every household

11:46.183 --> 11:47.924
to get themselves
an alarm system.

11:48.011 --> 11:50.057
[murmuring]

11:50.144 --> 11:52.929
Interesting answer.
Terri?

11:53.016 --> 11:54.714
Well, one thing
that would help

11:54.801 --> 11:57.020
is to strengthen our
Neighborhood Watch program.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.892
We need to be looking out
for each other.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.894
[applause]

12:03.070 --> 12:05.376
And I am very proud of
the speed bumps

12:05.463 --> 12:07.161
that I instituted.

12:07.248 --> 12:10.033
I think year-round school
is a great idea.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.774
I mean, summer camps
cost a fortune.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.341
[murmuring]

12:13.428 --> 12:16.779
Well, I look forward to our
family vacation every summer.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.521
It's important
to have down time.

12:19.608 --> 12:20.435
[whispers]
Mom's killin' it.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.787
Uh, the best part about
being mayor.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.746
I'm gonna say the perks.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.705
I mean,
I'll never have to pay for
another parking ticket again.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.098
[audience exclaiming]

12:31.185 --> 12:33.448
Terri: For me,
the best part is

12:33.535 --> 12:34.971
being able to make
a difference

12:35.058 --> 12:36.494
in a community
I really care about.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.235
You gave him
Bitter Truth Truffles,
didn't you?

12:38.322 --> 12:41.021
We gave them both
truth truffles.

12:41.108 --> 12:43.327
I was wrong.
You are just as
irresponsible

12:43.414 --> 12:44.720
as the other protectors.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.026
You need to fix this.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.463
We will.
Don't worry.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.552
Terri: And most of all,
I want the Saffron Falls

12:50.639 --> 12:51.771
that we know and love

12:51.858 --> 12:55.296
to be there for our
children's future.

12:55.383 --> 12:59.039
This has been, by far,
the most bizarre debate
I've ever moderated.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.997
- [laughter]
- We're almost out of time,

13:01.084 --> 13:02.607
- but before--
- Before we end,

13:02.694 --> 13:04.696
there's something
I need to ask my opponent.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.830
Terri, you're the
preservation candidate.
Am I right?

13:07.917 --> 13:09.876
Yes. I'm proud of that.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.356
I love our little town
exactly as it is.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.663
So why did you start
a successful petition

13:14.750 --> 13:16.273
to tear down
the old main library,

13:16.360 --> 13:17.884
and build an outdoor
music stage?

13:17.971 --> 13:20.190
[murmuring]

13:20.277 --> 13:22.323
Uh-- [clears throat]

13:22.410 --> 13:24.281
Well, Adam, I--

13:27.458 --> 13:29.417
I was very young
at the time,

13:29.504 --> 13:32.507
and seeing my favorite bands
was important to me then.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.683
But I regret that choice now,

13:34.770 --> 13:36.990
which is why I am the
preservation candidate.

13:37.077 --> 13:40.471
So, then why didn't you make
that information public?

13:40.558 --> 13:43.300
Well, obviously,
I was hoping no one
would find out.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.694
In fact,
I went out of my way
to cover it up.

13:45.781 --> 13:46.826
[murmuring]

13:50.742 --> 13:52.614
And that ends this debate.

13:52.701 --> 13:53.833
Thank you all for coming.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.747
[tepid applause]

13:57.227 --> 13:58.838
Hi, honey.
That was--

13:58.925 --> 14:00.796
Please tell me
it's not as bad as
I think it was.

14:00.883 --> 14:01.841
It's worse.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.016
I'll go get the car.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.237
That did not go
as planned.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.239
When does the magic ever
go as planned, Kelly?

14:09.326 --> 14:12.068
We need to get your mom
and Lever un-spelled ASAP.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.244
Only one problem:
Your mom is not going to be

14:14.331 --> 14:16.159
in the mood for a truffle
after that debate.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.248
I lost my appetite
just watching it.

14:23.297 --> 14:25.690
Boy, Mr. Morris
is not happy.

14:25.777 --> 14:26.691
I have an idea.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.920
Okay, put the truffle
in the hot water.

14:44.274 --> 14:45.101
Brilliant.

14:47.364 --> 14:49.671
We brought you
a nice cup of hot cocoa

14:49.758 --> 14:50.890
to make you feel better.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.500
[sighs]
Nothing can do that
right now.

14:52.587 --> 14:54.894
Just take a sip.

14:54.981 --> 14:55.982
[sighs]

14:59.768 --> 15:02.771
Delicious.
Thanks, girls.

15:02.858 --> 15:05.861
What I want to know
is how Lever got that
information on you.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.124
That was some
heavy digging.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.386
[whispers]
Give him the truffle.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.649
Not yet.
Mr. Lever.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.782
How did you discover
all that stuff about my mom

15:13.869 --> 15:15.175
and the old main library?

15:15.262 --> 15:16.654
Uh, from Mama P.

15:16.741 --> 15:17.917
She's been spying for me

15:18.004 --> 15:20.093
ever since you made her cafe
your headquarters.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.486
Mama P?
How could she do that?

15:22.573 --> 15:24.184
Uh, would you like
a truffle?

15:24.271 --> 15:25.750
Honestly, they're
a little bitter.

15:25.837 --> 15:26.751
The first one
brought you luck,

15:26.838 --> 15:28.710
so this one will, too.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.059
It did make me
a winner.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.191
[chuckles]

15:35.108 --> 15:36.544
Uh, listen, Terri,

15:36.631 --> 15:38.328
sorry for, uh,
ambushing you there.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.335
[bell jingles]

15:45.422 --> 15:47.555
- Hey, how'd it go?
- How could you?

15:47.642 --> 15:49.949
Spying on my mom
for Adam Lever?

15:50.036 --> 15:51.124
Wait, what?

15:51.211 --> 15:52.647
How could you do that
to Mrs. Quinn?

15:52.734 --> 15:53.996
To Kelly?
To us?

15:54.083 --> 15:55.955
You're all overreacting.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.739
It wasn't such a big deal.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.175
"Terri is Terrific!"

15:59.262 --> 16:01.699
How can you be
so two-faced?

16:01.786 --> 16:03.440
It was nothing personal
against your mom.

16:03.527 --> 16:04.964
I love Terri.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.878
It's just that
Adam and I--

16:06.966 --> 16:08.402
This doesn't
sound like you,
Mama P.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.795
Oh, yes, it does.
Trust me.

16:10.882 --> 16:12.536
Is this really true?

16:12.623 --> 16:15.583
You were spying on
Mrs. Quinn for Lever?

16:15.670 --> 16:18.890
Well, technically, yes.
But you need to understand--

16:18.978 --> 16:20.631
I don't want to hear
your excuses.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.764
You betrayed
your friends.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.722
How can I work for
someone like that?

16:24.809 --> 16:27.073
- Jake.
- I quit.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.465
We're out of here.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.774
[bell jingles]

16:35.255 --> 16:37.561
Hi, Mom.

16:37.648 --> 16:40.825
Want to see what the
Saffron Falls Herald
thought of the debate?

16:40.912 --> 16:43.132
Not really.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.308
"Quinn Didn't Win."

16:45.395 --> 16:46.788
I'm sorry, Mom.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.094
No, I'm sorry.

16:48.181 --> 16:50.009
I let everybody down.

16:50.096 --> 16:54.013
I never expected
that old mistake
to come out.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.755
You once told me to
never let a good mistake
go to waste.

16:57.842 --> 17:01.759
You said own up to it,
learn from it and move on.

17:01.846 --> 17:05.894
Hm. So now
you listen to me?

17:05.981 --> 17:08.288
What you did
was in the past.

17:08.375 --> 17:12.204
You're running against someone
who's doing bad things now.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.642
You're the best and
only choice for mayor.

17:14.729 --> 17:19.299
You just have to keep fighting
to convince people of that.

17:19.386 --> 17:23.041
Wow. Maybe you should be
running for mayor.

17:23.128 --> 17:25.305
Maybe I should
graduate high school first.

17:25.392 --> 17:28.002
[chuckles]

17:28.089 --> 17:29.135
Thanks, honey.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.142
Mr. Morris.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.318
I have nothing
to say to you.

17:38.405 --> 17:40.059
Please.
Just hear us out.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.799
You spelled
two innocent people.

17:41.886 --> 17:42.974
You had no right to
interfere in that debate.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.324
You're right.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.021
We shouldn't have given them
the truth truffles.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.283
Blame me,
it was my idea.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.329
Kelly is kind of
obsessed with magic.

17:50.634 --> 17:51.983
But in a good way.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.724
Mr. Morris,
you know we care
about the magic.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.204
Caroline is out there,

17:55.291 --> 17:57.337
and it's only a matter of time
before she spells us all.

17:58.816 --> 18:01.689
Please, we need to
work together.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.647
Look,
I've already told you
everything I know.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.475
We're not so sure
that's true.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.434
Yes, something
doesn't make sense.

18:07.521 --> 18:10.176
It's been 20 years since
Caroline, RJ and Noelle
had the book,

18:10.263 --> 18:12.569
and you're still
tracking it?

18:12.656 --> 18:14.093
And instead of
getting on with your life,

18:14.180 --> 18:15.790
you've kept tabs on
all the protectors.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.270
You even moved to
Saffron Falls

18:17.357 --> 18:19.228
when you heard
Noelle was opening
her restaurant here.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.491
You got a permanent job
teaching at Fox Canyon

18:21.578 --> 18:23.319
just to be
close to the magic.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.713
We can't stop Caroline
if we don't know
the whole story.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.411
Now's your chance
before we're all cursed
and it's too late.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.719
[sighs]

18:31.806 --> 18:34.156
Yes, you're right.

18:34.243 --> 18:35.549
There is more to the story.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.335
This is a bad idea,
Caroline.

18:39.422 --> 18:40.728
So don't help me.

18:43.078 --> 18:44.384
But I'm doing it
either way.

18:44.471 --> 18:45.820
You can't figure it out
on your own,

18:45.907 --> 18:48.344
it's-- it's too
complicated.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.303
We'll see.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.043
Changing the
Pick A Date recipe

18:52.131 --> 18:54.959
to go forward in time
instead of backward is
dangerous.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.265
There's too many unknowns.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.920
You're a brainiac.
You can figure it out.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.748
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

19:00.835 --> 19:04.143
Because I have the
biggest audition of my life
on Thursday.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.709
I'm sure you'll be fine.

19:05.796 --> 19:08.756
I need to do better
than just fine.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.714
You only get one shot
to audition for

19:10.801 --> 19:13.021
the National Conservatory
of Ballet.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.936
- I need to nail it.
- So practice.

19:15.023 --> 19:17.417
I have been,
constantly.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.854
But I'm not leaving
anything to chance.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.161
I'm gonna go forward to Friday
to see if I got in,

19:22.248 --> 19:23.771
and if I did,

19:23.858 --> 19:25.512
then I won't be so nervous
for my audition.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.557
And what happens if
you didn't get accepted?

19:27.644 --> 19:31.213
The teachers always write
critiques for each dancer.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.476
I'll be able to fix
whatever they didn't like.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.789
Hold on, let me make sure
I didn't miss anything.

19:41.876 --> 19:44.183
I increased the teaspoon
of torian basil
to two teaspoons,

19:44.270 --> 19:45.749
and added half a tablespoon
of merwaldian--

19:45.836 --> 19:48.012
Stop worrying.
I trust you.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.492
Let me check
one more time.

19:53.409 --> 19:54.541
Take me to this Friday.

19:54.628 --> 19:55.455
No, Caroline!

20:08.207 --> 20:10.644
Mr. Morris:
When Caroline
got to the future,

20:10.731 --> 20:13.299
she discovered
she didn't get in.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.041
She was devastated.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.695
But she knew she could
go back in time,

20:18.782 --> 20:20.610
and work harder
for her audition.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.184
But when she
tried to go back,

20:29.271 --> 20:30.707
she couldn't.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.840
The date didn't work.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.581
Kelly:
I don't understand.
What went wrong?

20:34.668 --> 20:37.018
I went wrong.

20:37.105 --> 20:39.934
My adjustments to the recipe
were incorrect.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.327
Caroline got stuck
in the future,

20:41.414 --> 20:43.198
and she lost a week.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.983
So that's why she
didn't get accepted.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.724
And she never recovered.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.117
She couldn't
reschedule it?

20:49.204 --> 20:50.945
The conservatory
holds auditions once a year,

20:51.032 --> 20:52.512
but by then,
the damage had been done.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.470
Her master teacher
was so disappointed,

20:54.557 --> 20:56.080
he lost faith in her.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.344
She was never invited back
to audition.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.563
But there are other
conservatories.

21:00.650 --> 21:03.523
That's true,
but this was her dream.

21:03.610 --> 21:04.611
After her teacher
dropped her,

21:04.698 --> 21:06.830
she was never the same.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.441
She got angry and bitter.

21:08.528 --> 21:10.312
She stopped going to
her ballet class,

21:10.399 --> 21:11.748
and eventually--

21:11.835 --> 21:14.316
Well, she quit altogether.

21:14.403 --> 21:16.927
And you've blamed yourself
ever since.

21:17.014 --> 21:19.103
I knew better.

21:19.190 --> 21:21.192
I could have just
taken away her spices.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.368
Anything.

21:22.455 --> 21:24.500
Well, you tried to help.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.110
I failed.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.156
And I ruined
Caroline's life.

21:28.243 --> 21:31.594
So this is why you've been
keeping track of the magic.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.553
Yes.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.381
I don't want anybody else
getting hurt by it.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.520
So Caroline's the one
making everyone forget magic.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.305
Maybe she wants it all
to herself.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.219
She thinks it'll
fix her life.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.091
Right. And if nobody
remembers magic,

21:50.178 --> 21:52.963
no one can come after her
once she steals the book.

21:54.095 --> 21:55.270
We need to find her.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.272
But how?
We don't even know
where she is.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.013
Well, we know she's
in Saffron Falls.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.276
That's where all the attacks
have been happening.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.409
If she's here,
why hasn't Mr. Morris
seen her,

22:03.496 --> 22:06.020
or Noelle or RJ?

22:06.107 --> 22:07.413
You'd think they'd
recognize her.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.197
Unless they can't.

22:09.284 --> 22:10.546
Remember,
Mr. Morris told us

22:10.633 --> 22:12.635
Caroline could change
the way she looked.

22:12.722 --> 22:15.203
Yeah, the Chameleon
Cauliflower spell.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.858
What if she's
using that right now?

22:17.945 --> 22:20.948
He said she used it
to get into dance clubs.

22:21.035 --> 22:22.645
That means her age
and appearance

22:22.732 --> 22:25.126
could be
completely different.

22:25.213 --> 22:27.389
She could even be a man.

22:27.476 --> 22:29.609
Caroline could be...

22:29.696 --> 22:31.393
anyone.
