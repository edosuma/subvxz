WEBVTT

00:06.090 --> 00:09.420
[TARRENT] WHEN I TRANSFERRED
HERE TO ST. JOHN'S, CRIME WAS
ON THE RISE DRAMATICALLY,

00:09.460 --> 00:11.510
AND NOW WITH MY HELP,
THE ROYAL NEWFOUNDLAND
CONSTABULARY

00:11.550 --> 00:13.680
IS PUSHING CRIME
OVER YOUR PINE-CLAD HILLS.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.010
&lt;PRESS REPORTERS
TALKING INDISTINCTLY&gt;

00:15.050 --> 00:17.100
[REPORTER] INSPECTOR TARRENT,
AN UNDERCOVER FEDERAL OFFICER,

00:17.140 --> 00:19.470
ANITA SQUIRES, WAS KILLED HERE
IN ST. JOHN'S.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.730
I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS
ANY POTENTIALLY ON-GOING CASES

00:22.770 --> 00:24.810
WITH THE LOCAL RNC
OR ANY OTHER FORCES.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.610
&lt;PRESS REPORTERS
TALKING INDISTINCTLY&gt;

00:26.650 --> 00:30.030
THE APPARENT WORD IS
ANOTHER OFFICER, JAKE DOYLE,
IS TERRORIZING THE POPULATION.

00:30.690 --> 00:31.780
[JAKE] STOP!

00:31.820 --> 00:34.530
RNC, YOU FRIGGIN' BELLHEAD!

00:34.570 --> 00:38.620
JAKE DOYLE AND
ALL OF MY OFFICERS ADHERE
TO STRICT PROTOCOL,

00:38.660 --> 00:40.700
-DISCIPLINE AND PROCEDURE.
-&lt;GLASS SHATTERING&gt;

00:40.750 --> 00:41.870
POLICE ARE NOT ABOVE THE LAW.

00:41.910 --> 00:43.420
WE DO EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.920
OH!

00:45.960 --> 00:47.540
[TARRENT] I STAND
BEHIND ALL MY OFFICERS
AND THEIR CONDUCT...

00:48.630 --> 00:50.260
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU!

00:50.300 --> 00:52.170
I STAKE MY REPUTATION ON IT.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.800
&lt;PANTING&gt;

00:53.840 --> 00:55.340
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DOYLE.

00:57.260 --> 00:58.050
STOP!

01:06.150 --> 01:07.650
WHY THE HELL DID YOU
MAKE ME CHASE YOU LIKE THAT?

01:07.690 --> 01:10.230
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING AFTER ME?
SEE, I CAN ASK STUPID
QUESTIONS TOO.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.280
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

01:12.650 --> 01:14.650
WHY ARE YOU TAKING PICTURES
ALL OVER THE COP STATION, HUH?

01:16.490 --> 01:19.830
ART! I'M AN ART MAJOR.
PHOTOGRAPHY AND...

01:19.870 --> 01:21.200
YEAH, YOU'RE AN ART MAJOR,
MY ARSE.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.120
YOU LOOK LIKE A PERV TO ME,

01:23.160 --> 01:24.500
SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY UP TO

01:24.540 --> 01:27.290
BEFORE I START GIVING YOU
A FEW TAPS IN THE HEAD, HUH?

01:27.330 --> 01:30.920
YOU'RE A COP, SO FROM
MY ADVANTAGE POINT,
YOU CAN'T DO NOTHING TO ME.

01:31.590 --> 01:33.130
IS THAT RIGHT?

01:33.170 --> 01:35.130
[JAKE] HOW'S THE ADVANTAGE
POINT NOW?

01:35.170 --> 01:36.800
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT...
YOU GOT ME ALL WRONG!

01:37.390 --> 01:38.470
WHAT DO YOU WEIGH?

01:38.510 --> 01:39.850
LIKE 160, 165?

01:39.890 --> 01:41.180
155.

01:41.220 --> 01:42.810
LET ME DOWN! I'M GONNA PUKE!

01:42.850 --> 01:43.890
OH, MAN,
MY OLD ARMS

01:43.930 --> 01:45.100
ARE GETTING
PRETTY TIRED HERE,

01:45.140 --> 01:47.020
SO THE SOONER YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO...

01:47.060 --> 01:48.270
NO, DON'T DROP ME.
I'M AFRAID OF HEIGHTS!

01:48.310 --> 01:50.270
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE 155,

01:50.320 --> 01:53.360
BECAUSE YOU FEEL A LOT
HEAVIER THAN THAT TO ME.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.530
OKAY, I'M WORKING
ON SOMETHING,

01:55.570 --> 01:57.280
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT IT IS.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.450
YOU CAN'T TELL ME?

01:58.490 --> 02:00.280
PUT ME DOWN.

02:00.330 --> 02:01.490
LET HIM DOWN. NOW!

02:01.530 --> 02:03.160
-JUST RELAX, OKAY,
TELLY SAVALAS...
-&lt;JIMMY GRUNTS&gt;

02:06.410 --> 02:07.460
&lt;GROANING&gt;

02:08.630 --> 02:10.290
I DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE!

02:10.790 --> 02:11.960
DID JIMMY JUST...

02:12.000 --> 02:15.130
YEAH. FELL RIGHT OFF
THE TOP OF HER.

02:17.010 --> 02:18.090
&lt;CLICK&gt;

02:19.260 --> 02:20.350
SO THAT'S JAKE DOYLE.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.220
HE'D BETTER NOT
GET IN OUR WAY.

02:23.260 --> 02:24.390
SO, YOU'RE WRITING THIS UP.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.270
WHY DON'T YOU GO FIND OUT

FROM A BUILDING!

02:56.090 --> 02:59.180
YOU SLIPPED.
NOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.140
WHY ARE YOU STAKING OUT
THE POLICE STATION?

03:01.180 --> 03:02.220
YOU'RE PARANOID.

03:02.260 --> 03:04.640
YEAH, I'LL BET YOU SUFFER
FROM DELUSIONAL TENDENCIES.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.310
-I'M JUST A TOURIST.
-A TOURIST?

03:06.350 --> 03:09.480
-YEAH.
-WELL, THIS IS SOME
VERY INTERESTING GEAR

03:09.520 --> 03:12.230
FOR A TOURIST.
UP ON THE ROOF,
THAT YOU SLIPPED FROM,

03:12.270 --> 03:16.030
YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING
ABOUT WORKING ON SOMETHING.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.360
-HMM.
-CARE TO ELABORATE?

03:17.400 --> 03:19.820
BUDDY, I WAS HANGING
UPSIDE DOWN OFF OF A BUILDING.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.280
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.700
BUT THIS LITTLE STUNT
YOU PULLED? HUH?

03:22.740 --> 03:24.370
IT'S GONNA LAND ME
ON THE STREET

03:24.410 --> 03:26.160
AND YOU IN FRONT
OF A JUDGE. HA!

03:26.200 --> 03:27.410
HOOD, CUT THIS GUY LOOSE.

03:27.450 --> 03:28.540
DOYLE.

03:30.290 --> 03:31.290
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

03:34.670 --> 03:36.130
-YOU'RE FREE TO GO.
-YEAH.

03:41.050 --> 03:45.260
HEY. YEAH, THIS LOCAL COP,
DOYLE? I HOPE HE DOESN'T
BLOW THE WHOLE PLAN.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.230
-&lt;SIGHS&gt;
-[MAL] HOME, SWEET HOME.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.730
&lt;BOTTLES RATTLING&gt;

03:55.730 --> 03:57.820
HOW MUCH RUM DO YOU HAVE
IN THAT THING, ANYWAY?

03:57.860 --> 04:00.400
TONS. CHEAP AS DIRT
DOWN THERE.

04:00.450 --> 04:03.360
&lt;LAUGHS&gt; NICE RETIREMENT, HUH?

04:03.410 --> 04:04.700
RETIREMENT INDEED.

04:04.740 --> 04:07.200
SO, YOU MISS SEEING ME
IN A BIKINI ALREADY?

04:07.240 --> 04:10.200
TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF AND
REMIND ME WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.290
NOTHING STOPPING US
WITH TINNY GONE,

04:12.330 --> 04:13.790
AND CHRISTIAN MOVED OUT
OF THE HOUSE.

04:13.830 --> 04:15.040
GOOD POINT.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.460
YOU MISS YOUR BOYS.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.880
I KNOW WE'VE TALKED
TO CHRISTIAN ALREADY,

04:17.920 --> 04:20.380
BUT I CAN TELL YOU MISS JAKE.
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE HIM?

04:20.420 --> 04:22.680
WONDER IF HE'S BEEN FIRED
FROM BEING A COP YET.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.720
50 BUCKS SAYS
HE'S STILL ON THE FORCE.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.350
-YOU'RE ON.
-&lt;LAUGHTER&gt;

04:27.390 --> 04:28.970
-TELL HIM TO COME BY
LATER FOR SUPPER.
-HEY,

04:29.020 --> 04:30.270
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT FEEDING HIM.

04:30.310 --> 04:32.060
AND IF HE COMES OVER,
HIDE THE RUM.

04:33.390 --> 04:34.520
OKAY.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.770
[TARRENT] YOU DROPPED
A MAN FROM A ROOF.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.440
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.900
IN SIX MONTHS YOU'VE
MANAGED TO DISOBEY
EVERY ORDER I'VE GIVEN YOU.

04:41.940 --> 04:44.700
THAT'S NOT TRUE, EXACTLY.
I MEAN, SOME OF THEM
I JUST IGNORED.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.370
YOU IGNORE ALL PROTOCOL.

04:46.410 --> 04:47.490
YOU GOT THE RNC

04:47.530 --> 04:50.910
IN THE NEWSPAPER 37 TIMES.

04:50.950 --> 04:54.330
ANY PRESS IS, LIKE,
GOOD PRESS, SO...

04:54.370 --> 04:55.460
YOU DROVE A SWAT VAN
INTO THE HARBOR,

04:55.500 --> 04:58.540
YOU'VE RACKED UP
200 HOURS OF OVERTIME,

04:58.590 --> 05:00.840
YOU SCARED A POLICE DOG
INTO RETIREMENT.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.720
THAT DOG WAS JUST NOT
CUT OUT FOR THE FORCE.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.390
-I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER
IF YOU ARE.
-YOU KNOW,

05:05.430 --> 05:07.510
I WAS DOING JUST FINE
BEFORE YOU MADE ME

05:07.550 --> 05:09.060
JOIN THIS SILLY LITTLE CLUB.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.270
PERHAPS IT'S BETTER FOR
EVERYONE INVOLVED

05:11.310 --> 05:13.430
IF YOU AND I JUST GO
OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.520
AND THEN WHAT?

05:14.560 --> 05:15.480
GO BACK TO BEING A SLIMY

05:15.520 --> 05:16.900
PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR?

05:16.940 --> 05:17.980
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YEAH.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.150
I QUIT.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.440
WAIT.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.160
LOOK, IF YOU WANT MY GUN,

05:26.200 --> 05:27.490
I NEVER CHECKED ONE OUT, SO...

05:27.530 --> 05:28.660
JUST WAIT. LOOK AT THIS.

05:31.410 --> 05:32.450
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

05:32.500 --> 05:33.660
[JAKE] IS THIS
ALBERT CHANDLER?

05:33.700 --> 05:36.370
ISN'T HE, LIKE, AN ORGANIZED
CRIME PIT BULL OR SOMETHING?

05:36.420 --> 05:37.960
WELL, HE'S ABOUT TO OFFER
TESTIMONY

05:38.000 --> 05:39.460
AGAINST HIS MOB FRIENDS,

05:39.500 --> 05:41.340
NOT JUST HERE BUT NATION-WIDE.

05:41.380 --> 05:45.510
CHANDLER HAS EVIDENCE
THAT A TOP MOB OPERATIVE
KILLED ANITA SQUIRES.

05:45.550 --> 05:47.890
HE'S NOT TALKING UNTIL
HIS TESTIMONY ON MONDAY.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.260
WHAT DOES THIS
HAVE TO DO WITH ME?

05:49.300 --> 05:50.720
JAKE, THIS IS A BIG FISH.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.810
-THIS IS...
-EXCUSE ME.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.310
PART OF THE REASON
WHY I CAME HERE

05:53.350 --> 05:54.480
TO WORK WITH THE RNC.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.270
I NEED YOU TO KEEP HIM SAFE
UNTIL MONDAY.

05:57.310 --> 05:58.810
ME? WHY?

05:58.860 --> 06:00.730
YOU MIGHT BE AN ARSEHOLE
AND A DISGRACE TO THE BADGE,

06:00.770 --> 06:03.230
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU WOULD
NEVER TURN TO THE DARK SIDE,

06:03.280 --> 06:05.030
AND RIGHT ABOUT NOW
YOU MIGHT BE THE ONLY GUY

06:05.070 --> 06:06.570
THAT I CAN TRUST. PLEASE.

06:06.610 --> 06:08.490
YOU WANT ME
TO BABYSIT THIS GUY?

06:08.530 --> 06:09.620
HE'S ABOUT TO TAKE DOWN

06:09.660 --> 06:10.530
A MAJOR ORGANIZED
CRIME SYNDICATE.

06:10.580 --> 06:12.580
THERE ARE A LOT
OF DANGEROUS PEOPLE

06:12.620 --> 06:13.490
WHO WANT TO KILL HIM.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.500
I NEED YOU TO KEEP HIM ALIVE.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.790
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

06:20.590 --> 06:22.300
I'LL DO THIS FOR YOU. I WILL.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.590
I'LL KEEP CHANDLER SAFE.

06:23.630 --> 06:26.380
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA
GET LESLIE BENNETT
HER JOB BACK.

06:26.420 --> 06:29.800
SHE'S LUCKY SHE ENDED UP
WHERE SHE DID. YOU OF ALL
PEOPLE KNOW THAT.

06:29.840 --> 06:33.260
BENNETT GETS HER JOB BACK
OR YOU'VE GOT NO DEAL.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.560
YOU KEEP CHANDLER SAFE
UNTIL MONDAY,

06:35.600 --> 06:37.060
AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
ABOUT LESLIE BENNETT.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.730

RELIEVE THE OFFICER
ON THE SCENE,

06:42.520 --> 06:44.570
AND I DO NOT NEED TO TELL YOU

06:44.610 --> 06:46.360

06:53.450 --> 06:54.450

06:56.160 --> 06:57.330
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

06:59.580 --> 07:02.590

07:06.670 --> 07:08.260
LET ME STOP HIM.
I'LL STOP HIM.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.930
ARSE IS OUT OF IT, BOSS.

07:13.970 --> 07:15.600
THE LITTLE SHAGGER
MIGHT HAVE SPOTTED ME.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.680
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL CHECK THIS GUY OUT.

07:19.190 --> 07:20.600
EVERYBODY STAY IN POSITION.

07:27.570 --> 07:29.200
HEADS UP! &lt;LAUGHING&gt;

07:30.740 --> 07:31.820
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

07:34.330 --> 07:36.660
"HEADS UP", SAYS THE DRUNK
AFTER HE KNOCKS ME DOWN.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.080
NOT DRUNK YET.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.160
THAT'S WHAT THE BEER'S FOR.

07:39.710 --> 07:40.710
Genius.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.920
SOMETHING WRONG?

07:45.340 --> 07:47.670
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT
YOU JUST CLOTHES-LINED ME?

07:47.710 --> 07:48.550
NO BUYING, THAT'S KIND.

07:48.590 --> 07:49.880
ON POLICE BUSINESS?

07:50.840 --> 07:52.220
NOW HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS A COP?

07:54.550 --> 07:56.430
WELL, UNLESS YOU WORK

08:31.550 --> 08:35.430

08:40.890 --> 08:43.390

08:50.230 --> 08:52.570
-YOU MUST BE CHANDLER.

08:55.740 --> 08:57.990
WHAT'S IN HERE COULD PUT

FOR A LONG TIME.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.790
IF YOU WANT IT
YOU GOTTA TAKE MY ARM TOO.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.700
-[EDWARD] IGNORE HIM.
-COULD YOU FIND A PLACE

09:01.750 --> 09:03.960

18:56.300 --> 18:58.340
NO, HONEY,
THIS IS JUST HOW JAKE LIVES.

18:58.380 --> 18:59.930
WHAT EXACTLY
DID JAKE SAY TO YOU?

18:59.970 --> 19:01.260
HE SAID TO TRUST NO ONE.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.390
I DON'T THINK HE WAS
TALKING ABOUT YOU,

19:02.430 --> 19:04.390
ALTHOUGH YOU ARE
THE LAST PERSON I'D SUSPECT.

19:04.430 --> 19:05.680
[ROSE] OH, DES, COME ON NOW.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.230
HE ALSO SAID NOT TO OPEN IT.

19:07.270 --> 19:09.850
NOT TO OPEN IT?
WHATEVER'S IN THAT CASE
GOT A MAN KILLED OVER IT,

19:09.900 --> 19:11.190
AND JAKE COULD BE NEXT.

19:11.230 --> 19:12.310
-&lt;SIRENS WAILING&gt;
-MAYBE WE SHOULD
TAKE IT TO THE POLICE.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.440
NO, NO, NO. JAKE SAID
STAY AWAY FROM THE COPS.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.650
-WHAT THE HELL IS IN IT?
-I DON'T KNOW.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.320
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.
I TOOK A PHOTO OF ONE OF
THE GUYS WHO GRABBED JAKE.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.160
HE LOOKED REALLY FAMILIAR.

19:21.950 --> 19:23.530
LET'S SEE.

19:23.580 --> 19:26.580
THAT'S THAT WOLF GUY. HE SPENT
TIME WITH JAKE IN PRISON.

19:26.620 --> 19:29.250
I ALSO TALKED TO A FRIEND
AT THE STATION WHO SAID
THE COPS WERE HOLDING

19:29.290 --> 19:31.460
ALBERT CHANDLER IN THAT
MOTEL ROOM. THE FEDS.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.540
CHANDLER IS A SOLDIER
FOR A NATIONAL CRIMINAL
ORGANIZATION.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.170
YEAH, AND HE WAS ALSO
SET TO TESTIFY

19:36.210 --> 19:38.420
AGAINST THE MOB ON MONDAY,
WITH DAMNING EVIDENCE,

19:38.470 --> 19:40.130
INCLUDING WHO KILLED
ANITA SQUIRES.

19:40.180 --> 19:43.350
-NOW THAT CHANDLER IS DEAD...
-THE ONLY LOOSE THREAD
IS THAT BRIEFCASE.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.680
AND IT PROBABLY HAS SOME OF
CHANDLER'S EVIDENCE AGAINST
THE MOB.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.640
REASON FOR THE MOB
TO WANT IT BACK.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.230
ROSE, CHECK OUT
THE CRIME SCENE

19:49.270 --> 19:51.690
AND SEE
IF THERE'S ANYTHING THERE.
ANYTHING WE CAN GO ON.

19:51.730 --> 19:53.440
-I'M ON IT.
-AND BE CAREFUL.

19:53.480 --> 19:54.520
I WILL, BABE.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.400
OH.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.780
HEY, YOU ALMOST
KILLED ME BACK THERE.

20:02.820 --> 20:04.780
YEAH, WELL, LOOK AT THE
BRIGHT SIDE. IF YOU HAD DIED,

20:04.830 --> 20:07.330
YOU'D NEVER HAVE TO LISTEN
TO JIMMY YAMMER AGAIN.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.160
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

20:09.830 --> 20:12.210
WHERE'D YOU STASH THE CASE?

20:12.250 --> 20:15.290
LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, I DIDN'T
STASH THE CASE ANYWHERE.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.380
AND SECOND OF ALL, YOU'RE IN
NO POSITION

20:17.420 --> 20:19.050
TO BE ASKING ANY QUESTIONS
THERE, PALLY.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.180
HOWEVER, I HAVE A FEELING

20:22.220 --> 20:23.590
THAT IF YOU GOT OUT
OF THOSE CUFFS,

20:23.630 --> 20:26.310
-THE POWER DYNAMIC WOULD
CHANGE DRAMATICALLY.
-&lt;SIRENS&gt;

20:29.100 --> 20:30.230
OKAY, YOU STAY COOL.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.100
&lt;SIGHS&gt; CRAP.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.310
&lt;INDISTINCT SHOUTING&gt;

20:40.360 --> 20:43.280
EVERYBODY STAY
PERFECTLY STILL,
AND NOBODY MOVE.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.620
THE DOOR WASN'T LOCKED.

20:45.660 --> 20:47.410
-JUST SAYING.
-WHERE IS IT?

20:55.040 --> 20:57.420
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO
NEED YOU TO OPEN THAT SAFE,
MALACHY DOYLE.

20:58.460 --> 20:59.340
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

21:03.430 --> 21:04.550
OH, MAN.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.100
THE COPS GOT THE CASE.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.140
ALL RIGHT.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.390
IT'S TIME YOU AND ME
HAD A LITTLE CHAT.

21:11.430 --> 21:13.100
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS
DOING AT THE MOTEL?

21:13.140 --> 21:14.850
WHY DID YOU KILL CHANDLER?

21:14.900 --> 21:16.520
IT'S A REALLY
INTERESTING STORY,

21:16.560 --> 21:19.190
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETIME,
BUT, UM,

21:19.230 --> 21:21.530
RIGHT NOW I WOULD PREFER
IF WE TALKED ABOUT

21:21.570 --> 21:22.690
YOUR MUSICAL PREFERENCES.

21:25.110 --> 21:26.570
MYSELF, I PREFER CLASSICAL.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.410
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

21:35.670 --> 21:38.290
WE BOTH KNOW
JAKE DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.090
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:40.130 --> 21:43.630
WELL, I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME QUESTION. I'M HERE
TO HELP JAKE,

21:43.670 --> 21:45.050
JUST LIKE YOU.

21:45.090 --> 21:47.260
LOOK, I WON'T PUT
MY NECK ON THE LINE
FOR JAKE DOYLE AGAIN,

21:47.300 --> 21:50.390
AND I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE
BEFORE I ARREST YOU.

21:50.430 --> 21:53.100
I'M NOT LEAVING HERE
UNTIL I FIND EVIDENCE
THAT COULD CLEAR JAKE.

21:54.810 --> 21:57.650
DO YOUR WORST,
LESLIE, OKAY? I'M SORRY.

21:59.770 --> 22:01.690
-WHAT ARE YOU
EXPECTING TO FIND?
-I DON'T KNOW.

22:01.730 --> 22:04.110
DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T DONE
SOME WORK ON THIS ALREADY.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

22:04.150 --> 22:06.490
I LOST MY JOB BECAUSE OF JAKE.
WHY SHOULD I HELP HIM?

22:06.530 --> 22:08.200
[ROSE] BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM.

22:08.240 --> 22:11.450
WE ALL DO. SO STOP BLUFFING
AND TELL ME WHAT
YOU'VE DUG UP.

22:13.620 --> 22:16.540
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
THERE WERE THREE SHOTS.

22:16.580 --> 22:19.710
THE FIRST BULLET WENT
THROUGH CHANDLER'S BODY,
IT KILLED HIM.

22:19.750 --> 22:22.460
THE SECOND BULLET WENT
THROUGH THAT WALL THERE.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.670
OKAY. WERE THE BULLETS
PUT INTO EVIDENCE?

22:24.710 --> 22:26.090
NO, I CHECKED.

22:26.130 --> 22:27.720
THERE'S NO MARK
FROM THE THIRD BULLET?

22:27.760 --> 22:29.470
THE KILLER MUST HAVE
EXTRACTED IT.

22:29.510 --> 22:30.680
COULDN'T FIND THE THIRD.

22:51.030 --> 22:52.160
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

22:57.290 --> 22:58.960
YOU EVER GONNA PAY
FOR ANY OF THOSE?

22:59.500 --> 23:01.540
YEAH. LATER.

23:01.590 --> 23:05.710
YOU'RE A COP. WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GET THEM TO ERASE IT?

23:05.760 --> 23:08.340
LET'S JUST SAY,
IF THERE'S, YOU KNOW,
CORRUPTION ON THE FORCE,

23:08.380 --> 23:09.430
I CAN'T SEEM TO ACCESS IT.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.520
OUT YOU GO.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.400
NICE RIDE.

23:26.360 --> 23:27.570
NOT EXACTLY
CONSPICUOUS THOUGH.

23:27.610 --> 23:29.740
WELL, YOU KNOW. SHE RUNS.

23:29.780 --> 23:32.740
YOU GOT A GUN POINTED
AT OUR BOY THERE, JAKEY.

23:32.780 --> 23:34.950
WELL, YOU KIND OF GOT ME
BACKED INTO A CORNER, WOLF,

23:34.990 --> 23:36.080
SO, YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.580
[BOYD] SO WHY'D YOU COME BACK?

23:37.620 --> 23:39.250
-STOCKHOLM SYNDROME?
-&lt;JAKE CHUCKLES&gt;

23:39.290 --> 23:42.580
NO, ACTUALLY. I'M HERE
TO FIND OUT WHY YOU GUYS
KILLED ALBERT CHANDLER.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.590
DROP THE ACT, JAKE.
WE ALL KNOW THAT
YOU KILLED CHANDLER.

23:45.630 --> 23:48.420
THE COPS HAVE THE BRIEFCASE.
THE WHOLE OPERATION
MIGHT BE BLOWN.

23:50.340 --> 23:53.050
WELL, DOYLE, YOU GOT YOURSELF
A SITUATION HERE.

23:53.090 --> 23:55.970
YOU EITHER DO SOMETHING,
OR YOU GO DOWN HESITATING.

23:56.010 --> 23:57.350
WELL, THAT'S NOT MUCH
OF A CHOICE.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.650
JIMMY, LOOK OUT!

24:02.520 --> 24:03.770
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

24:05.820 --> 24:07.070
&lt;WOLF SIGHS&gt;

24:08.900 --> 24:10.650
PICK HIM UP. DRAG HIM INSIDE.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.790
-YOU FIND IT COLD IN HERE?
-I DO NOT KNOW HOW
SERIOUSLY YOU'RE TAKING THIS,

24:24.830 --> 24:27.090
DESMOND, REALLY. I DON'T.

24:27.130 --> 24:30.050
DO YOU REALIZE
THAT THE CONTENTS OF THIS CASE

24:30.090 --> 24:33.550
COULD PUT AWAY SLEWS
OF MURDERERS AND GUN RUNNERS?

24:33.590 --> 24:35.550
-YEAH, I KNOW IT'S NOT
FREEZING, BUT...
-YOU'RE COLD?

24:35.600 --> 24:37.100
YEAH. I FIND IT NIPPY, YEAH.

24:37.140 --> 24:39.720
AND YOU CAN JUST GET ME A
SWEATER IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE
TURNING UP THE HEAT.

24:39.770 --> 24:44.650
JUST TELL US WHERE YOU
AND MALACHY HID THE CONTENTS
OF THAT CASE.

24:44.690 --> 24:47.190
YOU SEARCHED MY HOME,
MY CAR, AND MY BUSINESS,

24:47.230 --> 24:49.610
ALL WITHOUT A WARRANT
OR PROBABLE CAUSE,

24:49.650 --> 24:51.610
ALL BECAUSE YOU FOUND
AN EMPTY BRIEFCASE.

24:51.650 --> 24:54.240
SO, THAT'LL BE ALL THEN.

25:05.330 --> 25:06.920
-THEY'RE LYING.
DO YOU FEEL THAT?
-HUH.

25:08.750 --> 25:12.760
-WHAT'S THIS?
-LESLIE BENNETT'S
PERSONNEL FILE.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.930
SHE'S VERY HANDY
WITH A RIFLE.

25:14.970 --> 25:17.760
-MEANING?
-SERGEANT HOOD, ARE YOU
AWARE OF THE FACT

25:17.800 --> 25:20.720
THAT LESLIE BENNETT HOLDS
THE RECORD FOR THE LONGEST
SNIPER SHOT

25:20.770 --> 25:22.680
IN RNC HISTORY?

25:22.730 --> 25:25.940
-NO.
-IF JAKE DOYLE IS
INVOLVED IN CHANDLER'S DEATH,

25:25.980 --> 25:27.520
HE HAD TO HAVE SOME HELP.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.520
LESLIE?

25:29.570 --> 25:32.900
I MEAN,
UNTIL WE FIND THE EVIDENCE
THAT MALACHY DOYLE IS HIDING,

25:32.940 --> 25:37.450
IT WOULD BE WORTH
A CONVERSATION WITH LESLIE
BENNETT, WOULDN'T YOU THINK?

25:50.800 --> 25:52.590
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ME SLEEP.

25:54.300 --> 25:55.760
SO WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

25:56.760 --> 26:00.060
THINGS MUST BE TOUGH FOR YOU,
HEY, JAKEY BOY?

26:01.810 --> 26:03.810
ARE WE BUDDIES AND SOMEONE
FORGOT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT?

26:04.520 --> 26:06.230
NO LIFE OF YOUR OWN.

26:06.270 --> 26:07.770
EVERYTHING'S ABOUT YOUR WORK.

26:09.190 --> 26:10.480
YOUR LOVE LIFE'S A MESS.

26:11.650 --> 26:13.570
GREAT. I'VE BEEN
KIDNAPPED BY MY EX-WIFE.

26:15.320 --> 26:19.780
EASY TO LOOK AT A GUY
LIKE YOU AND SEE A MAN
WITH ONLY SELFISH INTENTIONS,

26:19.820 --> 26:22.080
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT'S TRUE.

26:22.120 --> 26:25.540
I THINK YOU CAN MAKE
THE RIGHT CALL

26:26.790 --> 26:28.210
FROM TIME TO TIME.

26:28.250 --> 26:29.580
WELL, IF IT WAS MY CALL,

26:29.630 --> 26:31.040
I'D GET YOU GUYS
TO TURN YOURSELVES IN,

26:31.090 --> 26:32.750
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

26:33.670 --> 26:35.470
I NEED THE EVIDENCE

26:35.510 --> 26:37.380
CHANDLER HAD IN HIS BRIEFCASE.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.680
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GIVE YOU
SOME INCENTIVE.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.770
&lt;PHONE BEEPS&gt;

26:43.810 --> 26:45.100
-[WOLF] WANNA TALK TO HIM?
-YEAH.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.020
JAKE, JAKE, I'M SORRY.
THEY GRABBED ME,

26:49.060 --> 26:50.190
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE
THE EVIDENCE,

26:50.230 --> 26:51.650
AND THE COPS
DON'T HAVE IT EITHER.

26:51.690 --> 26:53.610
-DES.
-I'M ACTUALLY SAFE,

26:53.650 --> 26:55.240
BUT I'M KINDA HUNGRY.
THEY HAVEN'T FED ME YET...

26:55.280 --> 26:58.780
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! DOES
THIS BAG CONTAIN NUTS?
I'M ALLERGIC TO NUTS.

26:58.820 --> 26:59.860
HEY, I'M ALLERGIC
TO NUTS TOO.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.870
-OH, REALLY? LIKE, ALL NUTS?
-TOTALLY.

27:01.910 --> 27:03.700
YEAH, I MEAN, I CAN EAT SEEDS
AND STUFF, BUT STILL...

27:03.740 --> 27:04.790
SHUT UP, WILL YOU?

27:06.750 --> 27:07.660
[WOLF] WHAT DO I DO
WITH THE KID?

27:07.710 --> 27:08.830
BRING HIM HERE.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.670
WE'LL CHOP HIS TOES OFF ONE
BY ONE

27:11.710 --> 27:13.420
UNTIL JAKE TELLS US
WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW.

27:17.720 --> 27:22.680
LOOK, I RAN THE BULLET
AND IT WAS FIRED FROM A
REMINGTON 700 SNIPER RIFLE.

27:22.720 --> 27:26.060
-AND?
-WELL, IT'S ONE OF THE RIFLES
WE USE HERE AT THE RNC,

27:26.100 --> 27:29.690
BUT WHEN I WENT TO
THE AMMUNITIONS LOCKER,
THE GUN WAS MISSING.

27:29.730 --> 27:31.940
YOU THINK A COP
PULLED THE TRIGGER?

27:31.980 --> 27:33.650
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW, ROSE.

27:33.690 --> 27:36.860
HONESTLY, I DON'T. AND I CAN'T
HELP BUT FEEL THAT EVEN DOING
THIS FOR JAKE

27:36.900 --> 27:38.360
IS GONNA GET ME
INTO MORE TROUBLE.

27:38.400 --> 27:41.110
HEY, LESLIE, THIS ISN'T
JUST ABOUT JAKE, OKAY?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.490
-IF YOU SOLVE THIS THING,
-&lt;CAR LOCK CHIRPS&gt;

27:42.530 --> 27:43.830
IF YOU BRING DOWN
THE REAL KILLER,

27:43.870 --> 27:46.200
THEY MIGHT THINK OF BRINGING
YOU BACK AS SERGEANT.

27:46.240 --> 27:47.660
I WOULDN'T HOLD MY BREATH.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.120
WELL...

27:51.790 --> 27:52.750
LESLIE?

27:57.760 --> 28:00.800
LESLIE, PUT IT DOWN.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.470
CONSTABLE, WE'RE GOING
TO NEED TO TAKE YOU
INTO CUSTODY.

28:03.510 --> 28:06.560
WAIT! THIS ISN'T WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE.

28:06.600 --> 28:10.350
LESLIE BENNETT,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. LET'S GO.

28:10.390 --> 28:12.900
[LESLIE] THIS ISN'T WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE. I'M TELLING YOU
RIGHT NOW, HOOD.

28:12.940 --> 28:13.690
[HOOD] COME ON.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.410
DES? YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:23.450 --> 28:25.030
YEAH, YEAH. I'M FINE.
HOW'RE YOU DOING?
WHERE ARE YOU?

28:28.370 --> 28:30.080
THERE HE IS.

28:30.120 --> 28:33.540
MAN, NOTHING FUNNIER THAN
A BAYMAN WITH A TAN, WHAT?

28:33.580 --> 28:35.080
RETIREMENT LOOKS AWFUL ON YOU.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.800
NICE TO SEE YOU TOO.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.920
I SEE YOU'VE MADE
SOME NEW FRIENDS.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.920
OH, MY GOD, WHERE ARE
MY MANNERS? SORRY.

28:40.970 --> 28:44.800
MALACHY DOYLE, MEET A BUNCH
OF POSSIBLE KILLERS.

28:44.840 --> 28:48.890
POSSIBLE KILLERS,
THIS IS MY DAD, MALACHY DOYLE.

28:48.930 --> 28:51.600
WELL, I'D LIKE TO SAY
I'M CHARMED, BUT I'M NOT.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.020
PACKAGE. NOW.

28:53.980 --> 28:55.610
[BOYD] COME ON, MALACHY.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.520
YOU DIDN'T COME ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE FOR NOTHING.

28:57.570 --> 29:00.280
-SEND DES OVER FIRST.
-HAND THE PACKAGE OVER.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.780
THEN I'LL SAY WHO GOES WHERE.

29:06.910 --> 29:07.780
LET THE KID LOOSE.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.410
[JIMMY] ARE WE HAPPY?

29:11.450 --> 29:14.000
[DONNY] I THINK SO.
IT'S A BUNCH OF DISKS.

29:14.040 --> 29:15.920
IT'LL TAKE A WHILE TO
FIND OUT WHAT'S ON THERE.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.380
ENJOY YOUR RETIREMENT.

29:24.430 --> 29:29.010
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO MY SON,
YOU'LL BE SEEING ME REAL
SOON, RETIREMENT OR NO.

29:29.060 --> 29:34.480
NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN TO
YOUR SON THAT HE ISN'T
DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR.

29:34.520 --> 29:37.860
IN THAT CASE, THE ODDS
AREN'T EXACTLY IN HIS FAVOR.

29:37.900 --> 29:38.940

29:43.030 --> 29:44.280
&lt;ENGINE STARTING&gt;

29:47.780 --> 29:51.080
WELL, JAKE DOYLE,
YOU MIGHT EVEN GET
OUT OF THIS ALIVE.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.120
&lt;JIMMY LAUGHING&gt;

29:55.540 --> 29:57.880
WE'VE HAD QUITE A DAY,
YOU AND ME, HUH?

29:57.920 --> 30:00.960
-YEAH, JIMMY,
WE CERTAINLY HAVE.
-YOU BROKE MY LEG.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.880
LIKE, THREE TIMES.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.630
I'M PRETTY SURE ONE
OF THOSE TIMES WAS
ACTUALLY A FRACTURE.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.970
JIMMY, THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME
TO BE DICKING AROUND.

30:10.010 --> 30:11.890
BOSS, LET ME AT LEAST DO IT
ONCE. I OWE HIM THAT.

30:11.930 --> 30:14.640
JIMMY, WE GOT THE DISKS.
LET'S JUST GO.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.810
-WHAT, CAN'T I GET
A LITTLE REVENGE?
-JIMMY, LOOK OUT!

30:16.850 --> 30:18.480

30:18.520 --> 30:20.820
-OH!

30:20.860 --> 30:22.320
OH, CRAP. OH, NO.

30:23.740 --> 30:25.950
BOSS, I... I DIDN'T MEAN
TO TASE YOU!

30:25.990 --> 30:27.030
I'LL KILL HIM!

30:27.070 --> 30:28.200
GO, SQUIRES. GO!

30:29.450 --> 30:30.490
WE'VE GOT TO GET THE EVIDENCE
OUT OF HERE.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.790
DID YOU JUST CALL HIM SQUIRES?

30:34.830 --> 30:36.040
&lt;BREATHING HEAVILY&gt;

30:36.080 --> 30:38.040
BOYD, I'M PRETTY SURE
I CAN TRUST YOU,

30:38.080 --> 30:41.380
BUT I CAN'T BE 100% SURE,

30:41.420 --> 30:43.760
-SO...
-&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

30:43.800 --> 30:46.720

I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT.
I CAN'T FRIGGIN' BELIEVE IT!

31:00.150 --> 31:01.860
WHAT? LIT HIM UP
LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE?

31:05.360 --> 31:07.200
-WE JUST LEFT HIM THERE.
-OH, HE TOLD US TO.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.360
-WE SHOULD GO BACK.
-HE'S GONNA KILL ME.

31:09.410 --> 31:10.450
[BOTH] YUP.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.300

SHE DIED,

31:31.050 --> 31:31.890
BUT SHE LEFT A HUSBAND.

31:33.550 --> 31:36.220
ANITA SQUIRES
IS DONNY SQUIRES' WIFE.

31:39.230 --> 31:44.020
THEY'RE FROM ANITA. SHE WOULD
HAVE BEEN WEARING A WIRE
THE NIGHT SHE WAS KILLED.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.190
-HANG ON.
-&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

31:45.230 --> 31:47.030
THAT'S NOT ALL.
ROSE THINKS

31:47.070 --> 31:48.990
DONNY IS SOME KIND OF
FEDERAL COP.

31:49.030 --> 31:50.660
THEY'RE ALL COPS! ALL OF THEM.

31:52.910 --> 31:55.870
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE ALL COPS,
YOU FRIGGIN' IDIOT?

31:55.910 --> 31:57.080
&lt;BOYD SHOUTING FROM THE TRUNK&gt;

31:59.120 --> 32:02.960
-TURN BACK AND GET THE BOSS.

33:31.920 --> 33:33.220
KEEP STILL, JIMMY, BOY.

33:33.260 --> 33:34.090

33:34.130 --> 33:36.180

-HE KNOWS IT HURTS,

33:36.220 --> 33:38.510

33:40.430 --> 33:43.770
SO WAIT, YOU GUYS ARE ALL,
LIKE, COPS? LIKE, EVEN YOU?

33:43.810 --> 33:45.480
SPECIAL OPERATIONS
UNDER COVER.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.110
ME, WOLF, DONNY, BOYD,

33:48.150 --> 33:49.730
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER
A LONG TIME.

33:49.770 --> 33:52.740
THERE WAS ONE MORE
OF US, BUT SHE'S GONE.

33:52.780 --> 33:54.070
WHY ARE WE LETTING HIM
FIX THIS?

33:54.110 --> 33:55.360
YEAH, WHY ARE WE LETTING HIM
FIX THIS?

33:55.400 --> 33:57.030
UH, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
STUDYING THE HUMAN BODY.

33:58.240 --> 34:01.080
ANITA. SHE WAS
THE FIFTH MEMBER.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.040
AND DONNY'S WIFE.

34:04.080 --> 34:07.500
TO ANITA. OW! COME ON!

34:09.250 --> 34:11.210
I MEAN, I'VE HEARD
ABOUT YOU GUYS,

34:11.250 --> 34:13.090
BUT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW
THAT YOU REALLY EXISTED.

34:13.970 --> 34:14.970
YOU KNOW,

34:16.430 --> 34:18.720
I THINK I CHIPPED
MY TOOTH IN THE TRUNK.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.760
-&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;
-THE REAR SHOCKS.

34:20.810 --> 34:22.270
THEY'RE GONE.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

34:22.310 --> 34:25.180
YEAH, I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GET THEM FIXED.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.640
NAH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

34:26.690 --> 34:29.190
THE TASERING KIND OF
KEPT ME NUMB ANYWAYS.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.610
SO ANITA SQUIRES
WAS DONNY'S WIFE.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.740
YEAH.

34:38.780 --> 34:40.240
SHE FOLLOWED A CASE HERE.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.830
GUN TRAFFICKING,
OUT OF THIS PORT

34:41.870 --> 34:43.330
AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

34:43.370 --> 34:45.250
WHEN CHANDLER
STEPPED FORWARD,

34:45.290 --> 34:46.540
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAD US
STRAIGHT TO HER KILLER.

34:48.250 --> 34:49.460
ANITA WAS ABOUT TO HAVE SOME

34:49.500 --> 34:50.790
HUGE BREAKTHROUGH IN THE CASE,

34:50.840 --> 34:53.170
THEN WE LOST CONTACT.

34:53.210 --> 34:55.380
-AND BEFORE WE COULD ACT...
-[DONNY] SHE WAS KILLED.

34:57.510 --> 35:00.220
ONLY ONE PERSON KNEW
WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER.
CHANDLER.

35:00.970 --> 35:02.680
AND NOW HE'S DEAD,

35:02.720 --> 35:04.350
AND ALL THE EVIDENCE IS GONE.

35:04.390 --> 35:05.640
&lt;CAR DOOR CLOSING&gt;

35:07.440 --> 35:08.480
DAD.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.610
HEY, GUYS. I, UH,

35:11.650 --> 35:13.900
COPIED ALL YOUR DISKS
ONTO THIS JUST IN CASE.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.110
THOUGHT IT MIGHT
COME IN HANDY.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.570
YOU'RE A TAD BRIGHTER
THAN YOUR SON.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.620
YEAH, HE HAS HIS MOMENTS.

35:24.790 --> 35:25.830
DONNY.

35:28.290 --> 35:30.710
YOU SIGNED OUT
THE SNIPER RIFLE
THAT KILLED CHANDLER.

35:33.250 --> 35:34.750
THIS ISN'T EVEN
MY HANDWRITING.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.630
WE FOUND THE RIFLE
IN YOUR CAR,

35:36.670 --> 35:38.340
AND THIS IN YOUR PURSE.

35:39.550 --> 35:41.180
LOOK, I KNOW THIS
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD,

35:41.220 --> 35:43.100
BUT I HAD NO REASON
TO KILL CHANDLER.

35:43.140 --> 35:45.350
REASON? WE CAN THINK
OF ONE REASON.

35:45.390 --> 35:49.230
THREE PAYMENTS OF 45 G'S
INTO AN OFFSHORE ACCOUNT,

35:49.270 --> 35:51.350
DEPOSITED IN YOUR NAME.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.690
WHAT? I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

35:52.730 --> 35:54.150
I WOULDN'T DO THIS.

35:54.190 --> 35:55.230
NOT ON YOUR OWN.

35:55.270 --> 35:58.280
BUT WE KNOW THE EFFECT THAT
JAKE DOYLE CAN HAVE ON YOU.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.610
[HOOD] GOT THESE
FROM A CCTV CAMERA.

36:00.660 --> 36:03.820
LOOK AT WHAT JAKE'S HOLDING.
EVIDENCE FROM THE CHANDLER
CASE.

36:03.870 --> 36:07.750
WE BELIEVE THAT YOU
AND JAKE DOYLE CONSPIRED
TO MURDER ALBERT CHANDLER,

36:07.790 --> 36:09.290
THAT YOU PULLED THE TRIGGER,

36:09.330 --> 36:10.710
AND THAT YOU WERE PAID
TO DO IT.

36:13.540 --> 36:15.710
[ANITA] AND DID YOU HAVE
TO DRIVE YOUR CRUISER?

36:15.750 --> 36:17.920
MIGHT AS WELL PUT ON A SIREN,
AND LET EVERYONE KNOW
I'M UNDER COVER.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.220
SHE SAID "CRUISER".

36:19.260 --> 36:20.220
[ANITA] SO, WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO MEET ABOUT?

36:20.260 --> 36:22.430
WHY IS IT ONLY PICKING UP
HER SIDE OF THE CONVERSATION?

36:22.470 --> 36:23.970
[ANITA] INVESTIGATING
THE HARBOR.

36:24.010 --> 36:26.970
SOMEONE'S FACILITATING
DRUGS GETTING IN THERE.
IT LOOKS BIG.

36:27.010 --> 36:29.100
THEY'RE USING THE PORT AS
A HUGE DROPPING POINT.

36:29.140 --> 36:31.190
YEAH, THEY MUST
HAVE AN INSIDE MAN.
I'M GETTING CLOSE.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.900
WAIT! HOW DID YOU
KNOW THAT, UNLESS...

36:35.690 --> 36:38.440
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:38.480 --> 36:40.990
-WAIT. NO...
-&lt;GUNSHOTS&gt;

36:42.990 --> 36:46.080
SHE KNEW HER KILLER.
IT WAS A COP.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.870
WE GOTTA GO FIND HIM, BOYD.

36:48.910 --> 36:52.370
WHATEVER SHE WAS TRYING
TO UNCOVER MUST HAVE BEEN
SOMETHING BIG TO HER KILLER.

36:52.420 --> 36:56.880
IF HER KILLER WAS A COP,
I THINK I GOT A WAY
TO DRAW HIM OUT.

37:05.510 --> 37:08.560
SO JAKE, UH, YOU HAVE
CHANDLER'S EVIDENCE,

37:08.600 --> 37:10.770
AND IT REVEALS WHO KILLED
ANITA SQUIRES?

37:11.430 --> 37:13.310
YES, I DO, DAD.

37:13.350 --> 37:14.690
AND I'M GONNA
TAKE THE EVIDENCE
AND I'M GONNA STASH IT

37:14.730 --> 37:16.770
AT THAT WAREHOUSE ON
THE SOUTHSIDE ROAD.

37:16.810 --> 37:18.980
220. 220 SOUTHSIDE ROAD,
YOU GOT IT?

37:19.030 --> 37:20.280
220. GOT IT.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.990
-I'LL MEET YOU THERE.
-ALL RIGHT.

37:33.160 --> 37:37.540
I MUST SAY, THIS HAS
TURNED OUT ALMOST
BETTER THAN I'D PLANNED.

37:37.590 --> 37:41.420
WELL. WELL, WHAT A TURD
YOU TURNED OUT TO BE.

37:41.590 --> 37:43.380
I KNOW.

37:43.420 --> 37:48.010
I FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT
OF GUNS OR WHATEVER
THROUGH YOUR LITTLE SEAPORT,

37:48.050 --> 37:50.350
AND I'M PAID A GENEROUS FEE
FOR MY TROUBLE.

37:50.390 --> 37:53.350
A FEW CAUSALITIES HERE OR
THERE, WHO CARES, RIGHT?
NOTHING MAJOR.

37:54.390 --> 37:55.270
GIVE ME THE EVIDENCE.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.320
WHY'D YOU KILL ANITA?

38:00.360 --> 38:05.030
MONEY, OBVIOUSLY. SHE WAS
TURNING OUT TO BE A DETRIMENT
TO MY EARNING SKILLS.

38:05.070 --> 38:08.320
LOOK AT YOU, ACTING LIKE
SOME KIND OF CRIMINAL
MASTERMIND.

38:08.370 --> 38:13.290
"SLIMY P.I. JAKE DOYLE,
AND DISGRACED COP GIRLFRIEND,

38:13.330 --> 38:18.420
"MURDER WITNESS FOR THE MOB."
RIGHT NOW, THERE'S ENOUGH
EVIDENCE ON LESLIE BENNETT

38:18.460 --> 38:21.460
TO PUT HER AWAY FOR THE
SHOOTING. AND AS FOR YOU...

38:24.090 --> 38:26.090
SORRY TO INTERRUPT
YOUR LITTLE MOMENT.

38:28.930 --> 38:31.350
TARRENT.

38:31.390 --> 38:34.180
WE GOT ENOUGH
TO PUT YOU AWAY
FOR A LONG TIME, BROTHER.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.600
ANITA SQUIRES WAS MY WIFE.

38:38.600 --> 38:39.360
WAS.

38:40.900 --> 38:42.440
IS THAT THE HAND
YOU SHOT HER WITH?

38:43.610 --> 38:45.650
HEY, WHY DON'T WE
CALL IT A DAY, DON?

38:45.690 --> 38:48.910
YEAH, LISTEN TO THE BOYS,
DONNY. WE GOT HIM.

38:48.950 --> 38:50.450
&lt;SIGHS&gt; YEAH,
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

38:52.540 --> 38:54.370
-&lt;GUNSHOT&gt;
-YOU SHOT ME!

38:55.000 --> 38:56.410
YOU DROP THE GUN, DONNY.

38:56.460 --> 38:57.460
&lt;GROANS&gt;

38:58.330 --> 38:59.500
CORPORAL SQUIRES.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.500
PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON
AND STEP BACK.

39:02.550 --> 39:04.170
WE NEED TO SETTLE THIS.

39:04.210 --> 39:05.420
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE KNOW THAT.

39:05.460 --> 39:08.550
DONNY, ANITA WOULD NOT
WANT YOU TO DO THIS.

39:10.510 --> 39:13.060
IF YOU TAKE THIS ANY FURTHER,
IT'S NOT ABOUT HER ANYMORE.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.520
THIS IS ABOUT ANITA.

39:16.180 --> 39:18.480
HE NEEDS TO BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT
HE DID TO HER.

39:18.520 --> 39:23.110
HE WILL. DONNY, LOOK AT ME.
SO YOU WINGED HIM
A LITTLE BIT.

39:23.150 --> 39:24.730
IT'S NO BIG DEAL
AT THIS POINT.

39:24.780 --> 39:26.400
NOBODY HERE BLAMES YOU.

39:26.440 --> 39:29.660
HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW, UM,
DONNY. I BARELY SAW ANYTHING.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.120
ME EITHER, DONNY.

39:31.160 --> 39:34.030
I'M HALF-BLIND AND
JACKED UP ON WHISKEY
AND PAIN KILLERS.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.580
ANYWAY, WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO
BE POINTING THIS AT AGAIN?

39:36.620 --> 39:40.210
NOBODY DO ANYTHING STUPID.
ALL RIGHT? JIMMY? JIMMY?

39:40.960 --> 39:42.460
NOBODY DO ANYTHING STUPID.

39:42.500 --> 39:45.090
LISTEN TO HIM, JIMMY.
LET'S ALL JUST RELAX, OKAY?

39:45.130 --> 39:46.510
WE'LL TAKE SOME DEEP BREATHS.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.300
DON.

39:49.630 --> 39:51.640
-I WILL SHOOT YOU.
-I HAVE TO DO THIS, BOYD.

39:54.390 --> 39:55.390
I HAVE TO.

39:57.140 --> 39:58.140
&lt;YELLS IN PAIN&gt;

40:00.190 --> 40:01.350
&lt;GROANING&gt;

40:01.900 --> 40:02.900
&lt;GROANING&gt;

40:06.780 --> 40:08.150
PARAMEDICS, WOLF. NOW.

40:10.860 --> 40:12.360
YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:12.410 --> 40:14.620
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SHOT ME.

40:14.660 --> 40:16.910
WHAT A TOOLY THING TO DO
TO A BUDDY, HUH?

40:16.950 --> 40:19.540
-I KNOW.
-I THOUGHT IT WAS
A FAIR TRADE...

40:19.580 --> 40:21.580
FLESH WOUND FOR
A LIFETIME IN PRISON.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.960
ONLY DID IT
BECAUSE IF I LOSE YOU,

40:24.000 --> 40:25.500
I'M GONNA BE THE ONE
PUTTING UP WITH JIMMY.

40:25.540 --> 40:27.340
-&lt;QUACKING&gt;
-&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

40:28.670 --> 40:32.220
SO, JIMMY.
NO HARD FEELINGS, RIGHT?

40:32.260 --> 40:34.300
YOU DROPPED ME
FROM A BUILDING,

40:34.350 --> 40:36.760
YOUR BROKE MY LEG, YOU
MADE ME TASER MY BOSS,

40:36.810 --> 40:39.930
AND THEN YOU SHOT ME
IN MY GOOD LEG.

40:39.980 --> 40:42.060
NO HARD FEELINGS?
IS THAT A JOKE?

40:44.310 --> 40:45.440
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
DICK-SMACK.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.570
HEY, THANKS FOR THE HELP.
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU GUYS,

40:50.610 --> 40:52.740
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
KILLED THAT GUY.

40:52.780 --> 40:55.530
LISTEN TO ME, PAY YOUR
PARKING TICKETS, OKAY?

40:55.570 --> 40:56.620
ALL RIGHT.

40:59.540 --> 41:04.630
YOU KNOW, JAKE, IF YOU'RE
EVER LOOKING FOR A JOB,
GIVE ME A CALL.

41:06.460 --> 41:09.630
WELL, I APPRECIATE IT,
BUT I GOTTA GET RID OF
THE ONE I GOT FIRST,

41:09.670 --> 41:12.420
AND THEN HONESTLY
I'VE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.630
DON'T LET FEAR
HOLD YOU BACK.

41:17.510 --> 41:18.510
LET'S GO.

41:18.560 --> 41:21.640
SORRY FOR TASERING YOU,
BOSS.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.770
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO IT
ON PURPOSE, AND I KNOW
YOU'RE SORRY, OKAY?

41:24.810 --> 41:27.310
-SO NO HARM DONE.
-REALLY?

41:27.360 --> 41:30.900
-OW!
-DO IT TO ME AGAIN,
I WILL DOUSE YOU IN LAMP OIL,

41:30.940 --> 41:32.860
AND I WILL MAKE A TIKI TORCH
OUT OF YOUR SCROTUM.

41:39.490 --> 41:42.620
SO... PINT?

41:42.660 --> 41:45.460
-OH, YEAH.
-YOU'D BETTER DRIVE.

41:48.540 --> 41:51.170
WELL, TO US?

41:51.210 --> 41:52.760
AND OUR LAST CASE?

41:52.800 --> 41:55.680
YEAH. YOU KNOW, I...

41:55.720 --> 41:59.260
MALACHY, I DON'T THINK
I'M READY TO RETIRE JUST YET.

41:59.310 --> 42:01.430
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT DEAD, RIGHT?

42:01.470 --> 42:02.680
RIGHT.

42:02.730 --> 42:04.640
THERE IS A LOT OF LIFE
LEFT IN US.

42:04.690 --> 42:05.640
I WILL DRINK TO THAT.

42:09.650 --> 42:11.320
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
WHAT DID I MISS?

42:11.360 --> 42:13.690
UH, I'LL HAVE A LIME
AND LAGER, HOLD THE LAGER.

42:13.740 --> 42:18.240
WELL, AFTER THE APOLOGY
FOR ARRESTING ME,
AND SOME OTHER APOLOGIES...

42:18.280 --> 42:21.870
LIKE BEING FRAMED
FOR KILLING AN EYE-WITNESS
KIND OF THING?

42:21.910 --> 42:23.910
YEAH. I'M A SERGEANT AGAIN.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.420
FULLY REINSTATED.

42:27.250 --> 42:28.580
RECORD'S CLEARED.

42:28.630 --> 42:30.710
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS TO THAT.

42:31.800 --> 42:32.710
THANK YOU.

42:37.010 --> 42:38.680
SO, ARE WE GONNA
BE PARTNERS?

42:38.720 --> 42:40.890
YOU KNOW, I'M KINDA
THINKING THAT MAYBE I SHOULD

42:40.930 --> 42:44.020
PROBABLY STICK TO THE THINGS
THAT I'M MEDIOCRE AT.

42:44.060 --> 42:48.770
IN FACT, I'D REALLY
APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD
RETURN THIS FOR ME.

42:49.860 --> 42:51.020
I MEAN, IF IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.230
SURE.

42:53.280 --> 42:55.690
SO, NOW THAT YOU'VE DECIDED
TO RETURN TO CIVILIAN LIFE,

42:55.740 --> 42:57.780
LET'S MAKE A FEW THINGS
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

42:57.820 --> 42:59.620
-OKAY.
-THERE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN A TIME

42:59.660 --> 43:02.410
WHEN I HAD REAL FEELINGS
FOR YOU.

43:02.450 --> 43:04.830
I ADMIT THAT, AND I LET THAT
GET IN MY WAY.

43:04.870 --> 43:07.460
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU
GET IN MY WAY ANYMORE.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.920
-LESLIE...
-SO GET THIS
THROUGH YOUR HEAD.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.710
YOUR FREE RIDE IN THIS TOWN
IS OVER, JAKE DOYLE.

43:12.750 --> 43:14.710
IF I EVEN SO MUCH
AS SEE YOU CROSS

43:14.760 --> 43:15.710
THE STREET TOWARDS ME,

43:16.720 --> 43:18.760
I'M GOING TO BECOME
YOUR WORST ENEMY.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.680
AND I'LL BUST YOU BACK TO
THE HOLE YOU BELONG IN.

43:22.300 --> 43:23.310
GOT THAT?

43:30.810 --> 43:31.810
WELL, NOW.
