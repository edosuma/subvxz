WEBVTT

02:43.859 --> 02:46.122
How we doing over there, boys?

02:46.253 --> 02:47.819
We have a winner yet?

02:49.604 --> 02:51.910
<i>Hey, Friedman,</i>
<i>you reading me over there?</i>

02:59.483 --> 03:02.182
Do you really gotta play
that damn thing right now?

03:02.312 --> 03:05.663
Is it, uh, messing up
your concentration?

03:05.794 --> 03:09.189
- Yeah.
- Then, yes, I do.

03:26.728 --> 03:29.644
Friedman, you're such
a pain in the ass
with that recorder.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.646
Watch this.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.789
Whoa, whoa, God, Thompson!

03:58.368 --> 04:00.240
- Hey!
- Dammit, Thompson, I had him!

04:00.370 --> 04:03.591
Oh? You had me?
I had one move and it was over.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.897
- Oh, is that right?
- They seem to think
that it's funny that--

04:06.028 --> 04:07.682
Cut the crap!

04:07.812 --> 04:10.554
McAllister, get back
to the top turret.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.730
<i>If Jerry's out there,</i>
<i>I wanna be prepared.</i>

04:18.083 --> 04:19.389
I can't believe this.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.619
Skies are clear for miles,
Lieutenant.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.709
<i>Jerry's still sleeping.</i>

04:34.839 --> 04:36.058
How's it look, Wilson?

04:36.188 --> 04:39.061
Might help if I knew
what I was looking for.

04:44.849 --> 04:47.243
<i>Looks pretty dull</i>
<i>from where I'm sitting.</i>

04:47.374 --> 04:50.768
Which, by the way,
is still very uncomfortable.

04:52.944 --> 04:57.079
For the last time Dixon,
I hear you and I don't care.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.477
- No offense--
- Here we go.

05:03.607 --> 05:07.089
No seriously fellas,
what the hell
are doing up here anyway?

05:07.219 --> 05:08.960
You know the answer
to that, Lieutenant.

05:09.091 --> 05:11.180
All they tell us is
"need to know."

05:11.311 --> 05:14.314
<i>Come on, Finn,</i>
<i>it's "Search and Destroy"</i>

05:14.444 --> 05:16.794
find the Nazi base,
take her out.

05:16.925 --> 05:19.057
<i>Oh, yeah, sure,</i>

05:19.188 --> 05:20.668
Could ya find
this damn needle, too?

05:20.798 --> 05:21.756
I left it over in this haystack.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.279
Stow it, Sergeant.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.760
Jerry moves this base
every time we spot it.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.328
This time, we're not
giving them the chance.

05:28.458 --> 05:31.548
So I need everyone,
and I mean everyone...

05:33.028 --> 05:35.944
stay focused and keep sharp.

05:36.074 --> 05:38.207
<i>Should be</i>
<i>almost there now, sir.</i>

05:49.827 --> 05:51.742
You really think we're gonna
find anything out here?

05:51.873 --> 05:53.440
<i>That's not our job.</i>

05:55.355 --> 05:57.705
You and I, we just keep
Yankee Lady flying.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.576
<i>Still got that compass</i>
<i>I gave ya?</i>

06:01.317 --> 06:05.234
Yeah. It's fancy.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.803
I don't think
this cute little thing's

06:08.933 --> 06:10.195
gonna point to any Nazi base.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.415
No, but it'll
get your sorry ass home.

06:12.546 --> 06:15.723
It better, too,
I need that back.

06:15.853 --> 06:18.203
That was given to me by
a pretty little thing back home.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.553
Oh, yeah?

06:19.683 --> 06:21.903
<i>Why don't you keep it, then?</i>

06:22.033 --> 06:24.471
Because I'm not the one
afraid I ain't gonna
make it home.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.647
I don't know, Jack.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.953
How many Nazi targets
you see bombed daily?

06:30.477 --> 06:31.869
<i>We're hitting them</i>
<i>where it hurts.</i>

06:32.000 --> 06:33.393
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>if I'm going to risk myself,</i>

06:33.523 --> 06:34.655
getting shot down,
at least let me do it

06:34.785 --> 06:36.091
on the front lines.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.179
<i>No, I get it.</i>

06:37.309 --> 06:38.615
I'll call up Berlin,

06:38.746 --> 06:40.704
set up a boxing match
between you and Adolf.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.489
<i>Ha!</i>

06:42.619 --> 06:44.404
Yeah, I'll put my money
on the Jew!

06:45.448 --> 06:47.232
- Smart.
- <i>Yeah, Holden,</i>

06:47.363 --> 06:49.017
I'll bet you
got a lot of relatives

06:49.147 --> 06:51.759
- who'd line up
to take a swing at der Fuhrer.

06:52.716 --> 06:53.935
<i>Trust me, kid,</i>

06:54.065 --> 06:56.720
one man can make
an impact on this war.

06:58.069 --> 07:01.508
Just maybe not
the way you think.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.205
I mean, have you guys
heard the rumors

07:03.335 --> 07:04.424
of what's going on down there?

07:04.554 --> 07:06.251
Those are just rumors, David.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.818
And if they're true?

07:07.949 --> 07:09.994
We should be going in there,
guns blazing,

07:10.125 --> 07:11.648
making sure they aren't.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.607
We do good work up here, Holden,

07:13.737 --> 07:16.000
and you need us
just as much as we need you.

07:16.131 --> 07:19.917
- Is that so?
- Lieutenant Rodgers,
tell me we're close.

07:20.048 --> 07:23.051
Based on intel,
we should be coming up

07:23.181 --> 07:26.924
on the suspected target's
visual range now, sir.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.275
Alright, everyone clam up.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.756
<i>Radio's off</i>
<i>until further notice.</i>

07:40.416 --> 07:41.461
Jack, you see that?

07:45.943 --> 07:48.032
Where? How many?

07:48.163 --> 07:50.034
Seven o'clock.
Looks like two fighters.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.690
<i>Out of range</i>
<i>but coming in fast.</i>

07:55.692 --> 07:58.652
Alright, you know the drill.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.654
<i>Do your job</i>
<i>and we all get home.</i>

08:01.481 --> 08:02.569
Hold on...

08:07.312 --> 08:08.444
That's not Jerry.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.103
No.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.847
<i>Those are RAF fighters.</i>

08:19.977 --> 08:22.066
Looks like a Spitfire
and a Hurricane.

08:27.898 --> 08:29.552
Crazy Brits.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.554
Harry, try to get them
on the box.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.819
Whew, I almost
swallowed my Beeman's.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.386
<i>This is B-17 Yankee Lady</i>

08:37.517 --> 08:39.301
<i>to Spitfire and Hurricane,</i>
<i>please respond.</i>

08:39.431 --> 08:40.911
For a second there
I thought we were gonna

08:41.042 --> 08:43.044
<i>have a rough morning.</i>

08:43.174 --> 08:44.872
<i>This is B-17 Yankee Lady</i>

08:45.002 --> 08:47.222
<i>to Spitfire and Hurricane,</i>
<i>please respond.</i>

08:47.352 --> 08:48.310
<i>I'm not getting anything.</i>

08:53.358 --> 08:54.534
Captain,
are there any RAF birds

08:54.664 --> 08:56.318
<i>scheduled to be out today?</i>

08:57.537 --> 08:59.974
No. Not that I know of.

09:00.104 --> 09:02.063
<i>Do you copy?</i>
<i>Please identify yourself.</i>

09:02.193 --> 09:04.282
<i>This is Yankee Lady.</i>

09:04.413 --> 09:05.806
No response, sir.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.895
I'm not getting
anything from them.

09:08.025 --> 09:09.723
Hey, maybe their radios
are down?

09:09.853 --> 09:11.202
<i>Yankee Lady</i>
<i>to unidentified Spitfire</i>

09:11.333 --> 09:13.378
<i>and Hurricane, please respond.</i>

09:14.989 --> 09:16.773
Come on, those are our guys.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.906
<i>Radio shot in battle, </i>
<i>now they're on their way home.</i>

09:19.036 --> 09:21.299
I got a bad feeling about this,
Jack.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.474
Quit your worrying.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.389
<i>This is B-17 Yankee Lady</i>

09:24.520 --> 09:27.523
<i>to unidentified Spitfire </i>
<i>and Hurricane, please respond.</i>

09:27.654 --> 09:28.655
<i>Still nothing.</i>

09:35.662 --> 09:37.446
<i>These fighters</i>
<i>are coming in quick.</i>

09:37.577 --> 09:39.753
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>I'm a sitting duck</i>
<i>back here, guys!</i>

09:43.278 --> 09:44.714
<i>Thompson, they are</i>
<i>right on our tail!</i>

09:47.456 --> 09:48.413
They're not veering.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.285
Uh, Thompson...

09:52.461 --> 09:56.160
<i>Thompson,</i>
<i>I need to know what to do!</i>
<i>They're closing in!</i>

10:01.296 --> 10:02.123
<i>They're going straight for you!</i>

10:07.519 --> 10:08.695
No!

10:29.193 --> 10:31.413
Krauts!
Shit.

10:34.938 --> 10:39.073
<i>Breaking right. Breaking right! </i>
<i>Holden, on my way.</i>

10:39.203 --> 10:40.509
<i>I'm right with you, Reynolds.</i>

10:47.429 --> 10:51.128
- Report in!
- Ball turret and tail gunner
took heavy damage.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.696
Didn't see they were Krauts
until they were
right on top of us!

11:00.442 --> 11:02.705
<i>Holden, don't fire</i>
<i>until you have a clean shot</i>

11:02.836 --> 11:04.185
<i>or you'll run out of ammo</i>
<i>real fast.</i>

11:04.315 --> 11:05.229
<i>You hear me?</i>

11:05.360 --> 11:07.188
Dixon, Pace, report in!

11:09.233 --> 11:11.235
- He's hit! He's hit!

11:14.412 --> 11:16.023
I'll go and check on John.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.684
<i>Reynolds, Holden, </i>
<i>my crew is dropping like flies!</i>

11:24.814 --> 11:27.469
<i>Tail gunner, </i>
<i>top and ball turrets all gone!</i>

11:27.599 --> 11:30.515
<i>Get these goddamn Krauts </i>
<i>off my plane, I don't care how!</i>

11:30.646 --> 11:33.040
Dammit, it's jammed!

11:33.170 --> 11:34.694
<i>Army Air Force piece of shit!</i>

11:45.226 --> 11:47.619
Rodgers!

11:47.750 --> 11:49.839
Is this the kind of action
you wanted, David?

11:51.449 --> 11:52.494
Uh...

11:58.195 --> 12:00.371
Get back on that goddamn gun!

12:01.416 --> 12:02.722
Get on the gun!

12:28.704 --> 12:30.750
<i>Time to split these bogies up.</i>

12:33.100 --> 12:35.015
<i>I'm breaking right.</i>

12:35.145 --> 12:36.799
- Roger, Holden.
- <i>I'm going left.</i>

12:36.930 --> 12:38.932
<i>Keep them off Yankee Lady</i>
<i>as long as we can.</i>

12:56.993 --> 12:58.647
You bastards!

13:06.002 --> 13:08.700
<i>Engaging the Hurricane, </i>
<i>I'm on his tail.</i>

13:15.664 --> 13:17.361
Come on, Finn! Let her rip!

13:17.492 --> 13:19.276
<i>They're coming in too fast!</i>

13:20.800 --> 13:22.802
<i>Ah, shit, I can't line them up!</i>

13:22.932 --> 13:24.673
Aim for the swastikas!

13:27.154 --> 13:29.069
- Son of a bitch!
- <i>Wilson!</i>

13:29.199 --> 13:31.245
<i>Forget the damn gun </i>
<i>and get the hell out of there!</i>

13:33.160 --> 13:35.771
Son of a bitch--
Come on, you dirty Krauts!

13:45.259 --> 13:47.391
<i>Mayday! </i>
<i>This is the B-17 Yankee Lady--</i>

13:52.048 --> 13:53.354
Come here!

13:58.359 --> 14:00.970
<i>Reynolds, Holden,</i>
<i>where the hell is our cover?!</i>

14:05.670 --> 14:08.021
Holden, tell me something good!

14:08.151 --> 14:09.413
Working on it!

14:35.309 --> 14:37.441
Go get him, little brother.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.793
<i>Holden, I've got</i>
<i>a little problem here.</i>

14:53.936 --> 14:56.156
<i>Holden, I can really use you</i>
<i>on my wing right now.</i>

15:04.338 --> 15:05.426
<i>I read you, Jack.</i>

15:06.818 --> 15:08.255
<i>I'm on my way!</i>

15:15.958 --> 15:17.090
<i>This guy's all over me.</i>

15:18.134 --> 15:19.744
Jesus! Jesus.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.007
<i>My controls are failing.</i>

15:21.137 --> 15:22.573
<i>Holden,</i>
<i>where the hell are you?!</i>

15:30.059 --> 15:33.323
David! David!

15:34.759 --> 15:35.891
Jack, get out of there!

16:09.229 --> 16:11.448
He made it! He made it, OK.

16:17.802 --> 16:20.544
Friedman, send out
a distress call, this location.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.199
We should--

16:25.723 --> 16:27.595
No survivors.

16:37.605 --> 16:38.606
No!

16:47.397 --> 16:48.572
Oh, my God...

17:35.924 --> 17:37.099
We're hit!

17:37.230 --> 17:39.884
<i>It's critical!</i>
<i>We're going down!</i>

17:40.015 --> 17:41.712
Repeat, we are going down!

17:46.500 --> 17:50.199
No. No! Dammit!

18:01.515 --> 18:03.473
<i>Holden,</i>
<i>you've got one on your tail!</i>

18:03.604 --> 18:05.084
Not for long.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.450
<i>We're losing altitude.</i>

18:23.580 --> 18:25.539
Everybody hold on!

18:31.153 --> 18:33.503
Alright, you son of a bitch.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.365
Erich...

19:38.829 --> 19:40.266
Brace for impact!

19:41.484 --> 19:43.182
<i>Landing strip! I see it!</i>

19:43.312 --> 19:45.445
We're gonna try
to take her down there!

19:45.575 --> 19:49.275
<i>Wait a minute, shit!</i>
<i>That's no landing strip!</i>

19:49.405 --> 19:51.712
<i>It's the goddamn Nazi base </i>
<i>and it's crawling with Krauts!</i>

19:51.842 --> 19:54.062
- Thompson!

20:09.033 --> 20:10.644
You Nazi bastard.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.163
Shit!

21:22.106 --> 21:23.238
Whoa!

21:56.532 --> 21:58.447
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:58.578 --> 21:59.927
Oh, come on. Come on.

22:01.407 --> 22:02.495
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:06.237 --> 22:07.761
Ah!

22:16.813 --> 22:18.641
Holy shit.

22:26.388 --> 22:27.955
Whoa!

24:07.446 --> 24:13.277
Let's see,
Jerry shot us down about here.

24:13.408 --> 24:14.714
North is the crash site.

24:18.544 --> 24:19.806
West is home.

24:29.511 --> 24:30.773
What do you think, bud?

24:40.435 --> 24:42.481
If there's a chance
they're still alive...

24:48.574 --> 24:49.923
OK, Jack.

24:52.403 --> 24:53.535
You win.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.195
Colonel Krieger, sir!

26:51.697 --> 26:54.177
What is this?

26:57.224 --> 26:58.268
Take him.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.750
No, no, no! No, wait!

27:01.881 --> 27:06.015
- No! Where are you taking me?

27:06.146 --> 27:07.626
Thompson! Thompson!

27:08.757 --> 27:10.193
Thompson! Help me!

27:10.324 --> 27:11.847
Thompson! Thompson!

27:11.978 --> 27:12.848
Where are you taking him?

27:12.979 --> 27:15.242
You Kraut son of a bitch!

27:29.909 --> 27:31.519
I'm OK, I'm OK.

27:37.699 --> 27:38.961
I'm sorry about your friend.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.010
After they take you, well...

27:45.576 --> 27:47.274
Not many come back.

27:47.404 --> 27:49.929
Hey, buddy,
why don't you just
mind your own business, huh?

27:50.712 --> 27:52.279
Suit yourself.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.411
Thompson, we gotta find
a way out of here.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.719
Finn, is that you?

27:57.850 --> 28:00.287
Holy shit, it's Lockport!

28:00.417 --> 28:02.506
The RAF guy we did ops with!

28:02.637 --> 28:04.552
Oh, boy,
we thought you was toast.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.902
Well, I can say
I've been better.

28:10.340 --> 28:14.693
They took Johnny...
my wingman.

28:16.433 --> 28:20.481
I wasn't sure
if I should be happy

28:20.611 --> 28:23.353
or cry when the screams stopped.

28:25.965 --> 28:29.272
Lockport, tell me
you guys thought of a plan

28:29.403 --> 28:30.491
to get out of here.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.583
Sorry, old boy.

28:36.932 --> 28:39.282
We're stuck here until the end,
I'm afraid.

29:54.009 --> 29:56.011
Alright, halt!

29:58.057 --> 29:59.493
We will rest for a moment.

30:04.585 --> 30:09.851
Two pilots shot down
and Standartenfuhrer
has left me to clean it up.

30:12.114 --> 30:15.901
We are lucky they found
the American bomber intact.

30:16.031 --> 30:19.034
Krieger would not survive
such failure.

30:20.296 --> 30:23.299
I do not care for his pilots.

30:23.430 --> 30:26.259
Nor the faith he places in them.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.783
You do not win wars with faith.

30:28.914 --> 30:32.700
Krieger is weak,
you see how he treats them.

30:32.831 --> 30:36.878
The Roth Brothers,
like his own sons.

30:40.969 --> 30:42.579
Would it be so bad
if they were dead?

30:46.670 --> 30:50.370
Two corpses would be
much easier to explain
to der Fuhrer.

30:54.026 --> 30:58.769
Do not forget our orders:
no survivors!

32:28.207 --> 32:30.644
Fritz! Let's go!

32:30.774 --> 32:33.777
They've found the crash-site.
Move out!

33:14.905 --> 33:17.299
Come. Sit.

33:19.867 --> 33:22.696
Talk with me... Harrison.

33:24.828 --> 33:26.482
This is your name, yes?

33:31.444 --> 33:35.274
Harrison... Friedman.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.300
Mm.

34:05.217 --> 34:10.526
When I was small,
oh, much younger than you,

34:10.657 --> 34:14.617
a boy of no more than
nine or ten,

34:14.748 --> 34:17.794
I remember my mother
used to sing to me.

34:19.318 --> 34:24.366
Each night she would sing,
"In Stiller Nacht".

34:24.497 --> 34:25.498
Do you know it?

34:28.066 --> 34:33.158
Oh, shame, it's lovely.

34:35.334 --> 34:39.251
When I was sad,
she would sing.

35:00.663 --> 35:04.537
I fought in the last war,
do you know this?

35:05.668 --> 35:07.453
Oh.

35:09.019 --> 35:11.109
I even fought
beside men like you.

35:12.762 --> 35:14.938
I once called a Jew
my brother.

35:17.158 --> 35:21.380
Oh, this was long ago.

35:22.729 --> 35:27.037
After the war ended,
I came home.

35:28.778 --> 35:31.651
It was not the same.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.567
Germany was not strong.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.134
We were not proud.

35:38.048 --> 35:41.269
I remember
how sick my mother was

35:41.400 --> 35:45.055
when the man from the bank came.

35:45.186 --> 35:48.755
You can imagine my surprise
when I saw that it was him,

35:48.885 --> 35:51.714
it was my brother, the Jew!

35:53.499 --> 35:56.241
I told my mother,
"Have no fear, I know this man.

35:56.371 --> 35:59.418
He is a good man."

36:01.159 --> 36:08.035
So I spoke with my brother,
begged him to leave us be.

36:12.126 --> 36:13.910
Do you know what he said?

36:17.175 --> 36:21.788
<i>"Dies ist leben."</i>
"This is life"

36:21.918 --> 36:24.312
This Jew took my home!

36:24.443 --> 36:27.010
This Jew made me a liar
to my own mother!

36:27.141 --> 36:30.405
How she cried.
The way she looked at me!

36:36.542 --> 36:40.720
My mother died,
cold and alone,

36:40.850 --> 36:44.898
because my "brother"
stabbed me in the back!

36:55.300 --> 36:57.780
I made sure I was there
when we took him.

37:00.957 --> 37:04.613
I made sure we took
his whole family to the trains.

37:08.051 --> 37:09.488
Do you know what he did?

37:11.141 --> 37:13.666
He begged me!

37:18.497 --> 37:20.890
Begged me to let them stay.

37:22.979 --> 37:24.720
Do you know what I said?

37:26.983 --> 37:30.639
<i>"Dies... ist... leben."</i>

37:38.430 --> 37:41.128
I will cherish
this memory forever.

38:02.541 --> 38:05.674
Do you remember the song
I sang to you earlier?

38:05.805 --> 38:07.285
"In Stiller Nacht"?

38:09.548 --> 38:12.159
It's been so long
since I've heard it.

38:17.033 --> 38:18.818
Do you think you could?

38:20.341 --> 38:24.171
Oh... please...

38:25.912 --> 38:29.176
it would make me very happy.

38:32.266 --> 38:33.572
Go ahead.

38:39.578 --> 38:40.579
Mm.

38:57.726 --> 38:59.206
That's enough.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.211

Thank you.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.020
Thank you for everything, Jack.

41:11.817 --> 41:12.861
Shit!

47:09.914 --> 47:12.003
Cap. Cap! Cap!

47:13.047 --> 47:14.570
You OK? You alright?

47:14.701 --> 47:16.746
I'm just great.

47:18.270 --> 47:20.315
- Hey! Whoa!
- Oh!

47:20.446 --> 47:23.449
Do you think you're in pain?
Does it hurt?

47:23.579 --> 47:26.017
You don't know
anything about pain.

47:26.147 --> 47:29.194
They will beat you,
they will break you,

47:29.324 --> 47:30.978
and they will do it
all over again.

47:31.109 --> 47:33.502
We do not have the luxury
to be weak.

47:33.633 --> 47:34.939
So wake up!

47:35.069 --> 47:36.854
Do not give them
that satisfaction.

47:38.986 --> 47:41.336
Come on, easy.

47:44.731 --> 47:47.647
Good.
Maybe you are not so weak.

47:47.777 --> 47:48.953
Who the hell is this broad?

47:49.083 --> 47:52.391
Marie St. Laurent.

47:52.521 --> 47:55.785
From what I gather,
she's a French Resistance
fighter.

47:55.916 --> 47:58.049
Been here longer
than any of us.

47:58.179 --> 48:02.053
Hey, I know we didn't get off
on a good foot before.

48:02.183 --> 48:05.665
But the way I figure it,
we're all stuck here.

48:05.795 --> 48:08.363
So it don't matter what you
think about me or Robert.

48:08.494 --> 48:09.712
Today, we're brothers.

48:14.282 --> 48:15.457
And you are?

48:15.588 --> 48:17.546
Private George Jackson.

48:17.677 --> 48:19.418
Me and Robert Wright were
driving the Red Ball Express

48:19.548 --> 48:20.898
when the krauts got us.

48:21.028 --> 48:22.769
What the hell
is the Red Ball Express?

48:22.900 --> 48:24.031
It's a new unit.

48:24.162 --> 48:25.990
We drive trucks
carrying supplies

48:26.120 --> 48:27.295
all over the front.

48:27.426 --> 48:30.124
We were on route
from Cherbourg last week,

48:30.255 --> 48:32.300
bringing repair equipment
for heavy aircraft.

48:32.431 --> 48:34.085
We think that's why
they hit us.

48:34.215 --> 48:36.522
They're using our supplies
to repair that bomber out there.

48:36.652 --> 48:38.654
Any news on Friedman?

48:38.785 --> 48:39.917
We overheard one of the guards

48:40.047 --> 48:41.483
saying they were
transferring him.

48:41.614 --> 48:42.832
To where?

48:42.963 --> 48:44.922
You don't wanna know.

48:46.010 --> 48:47.620
Easy, Cap,
you're pretty busted up.

48:47.750 --> 48:49.578
No, we gotta get Harry.

48:49.709 --> 48:51.580
- They're gonna kill him.
We have bigger problems.

48:51.711 --> 48:54.322
We were scouting
this facility for weeks.

48:54.453 --> 48:57.673
They captured us,
but not before we found out
what was happening.

48:57.804 --> 48:58.979
What are they up to?

48:59.110 --> 49:00.894
They have developed something

49:01.025 --> 49:02.374
called a "wunderwaffe."

49:02.504 --> 49:03.984
English, lady.

49:04.115 --> 49:07.031
It means "super weapon."

49:07.161 --> 49:08.684
From what I can tell,

49:08.815 --> 49:12.645
it's a single bomb that could
destroy an entire city.

49:12.775 --> 49:15.865
One bomb? I don't believe it.

49:15.996 --> 49:17.650
Believe whatever you want!

49:17.780 --> 49:21.262
OK, so they got a big bomb.
Does it work?

49:24.135 --> 49:26.311
Great. And if it does,

49:26.441 --> 49:28.748
what the hell are we
supposed to do about it?

49:28.878 --> 49:30.750
We gotta find a way out of here.

49:30.880 --> 49:34.406
I'm telling you, it's gonna take
a miracle to get us out of here.

49:34.536 --> 49:36.625
Then we need a miracle.

50:00.780 --> 50:01.911
Roth.

50:04.610 --> 50:06.133
Well, now I have a name.

50:24.151 --> 50:26.806
Who needs German
when you speak pilot?

50:27.720 --> 50:28.764
So, we're here.

50:28.895 --> 50:30.331
Which means Yankee Lady...

50:31.854 --> 50:34.205
could have landed right there.
That is not that far.

50:36.424 --> 50:37.860
OK.

50:41.560 --> 50:42.735
OK.

51:01.101 --> 51:02.407
Wait a second.

51:05.932 --> 51:08.717
No. No.

51:19.467 --> 51:21.904
They're gonna use our bombers
to level London.

51:24.168 --> 51:25.995
Those sons of...

51:50.324 --> 51:54.763
Well, Jack, you did say
one man can make a difference.

51:55.808 --> 51:57.070
Let's find out.

52:00.856 --> 52:02.336
Please, be careful.

52:02.467 --> 52:04.077
No!

52:04.208 --> 52:05.209
Yes, better.

52:15.088 --> 52:18.091
Doctor,
are you sure we are safe?

52:18.222 --> 52:21.007
Oh, uh, completely safe,
Herr Standartenfuhrer

52:21.138 --> 52:25.794
But that does not mean
they should not be more careful!

52:25.925 --> 52:30.016
Captain, see to it this payload
is safely installed.

52:33.759 --> 52:35.021
Show me the weapon.

53:23.156 --> 53:25.071
"A pretty little thing
back home."

53:30.468 --> 53:34.428
All this time,
there was only one, huh?

54:52.898 --> 54:54.465
I must be out of my mind.

55:36.463 --> 55:37.508
Yes!

56:16.460 --> 56:18.113
What's going on up there?

56:52.321 --> 56:54.802
Fall back, fall back!

1:00:01.728 --> 1:00:03.164
My brother.

1:00:58.829 --> 1:01:00.178
Come on, Holden.

1:01:01.179 --> 1:01:02.136
Focus.

1:01:02.267 --> 1:01:05.052
OK. OK, OK.

1:01:56.538 --> 1:01:58.889
<i>Is this the kind of</i>
<i>action you wanted, David?</i>

1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:03.589
<i>Holden,</i>
<i>where the hell are you?</i>

1:02:20.432 --> 1:02:22.521
Heil Hitler, Major!

1:02:22.651 --> 1:02:25.437
We have been searching for you
and the captain,

1:02:25.567 --> 1:02:27.918
as well as the American pilot.

1:02:29.223 --> 1:02:31.965
The captain is dead.
Report.

1:02:32.096 --> 1:02:33.793
We were ambushed, sir.

1:02:33.924 --> 1:02:36.883
Six dead,
three seriously wounded.

1:02:37.014 --> 1:02:39.973
I have our remaining men
searching the forest
for the soldier.

1:02:42.367 --> 1:02:47.198
Soldier? One soldier?

1:02:50.418 --> 1:02:53.639
You let one soldier
defeat an entire patrol?

1:02:53.770 --> 1:02:55.380
We believe
he may be wounded.

1:02:55.510 --> 1:03:00.254
Captain, your men are in need
of medical attention.

1:03:00.385 --> 1:03:03.257
Return to base
and give a full report,

1:03:03.388 --> 1:03:05.433
I will find the American.

1:03:05.564 --> 1:03:08.828
- My orders were to find you
and the captain--
- There is no time to argue.

1:03:08.959 --> 1:03:10.351
I know, sir.

1:03:15.226 --> 1:03:20.535
Your disgraceful display will be
included in my report, Captain.

1:03:22.363 --> 1:03:27.716
Unless, of course,
I retrieve the soldier for you.

1:03:27.847 --> 1:03:31.590
Perhaps then you
will not seem so inept.

1:03:40.512 --> 1:03:42.253
I am sorry, sir.

1:03:43.645 --> 1:03:46.953
I cannot disobey orders.

1:04:00.575 --> 1:04:02.273
So, what if one of us
fakes sick?

1:04:02.403 --> 1:04:04.928
Guard opens the door,
we jump him,

1:04:05.058 --> 1:04:07.147
take his gun
and bolt to freedom?

1:04:07.278 --> 1:04:08.801
Yeah, I like how that sounds.

1:04:08.932 --> 1:04:11.848
Won't work. These Krauts
don't care about us.

1:04:11.978 --> 1:04:14.938
The minute they walk in here,
we're dead.

1:04:15.068 --> 1:04:16.591
Well, we can't just sit here
and do nothing,

1:04:16.722 --> 1:04:18.419
they're gonna kill us
no matter what!

1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:25.383
Maybe we should, uh,
all be brainstorming, here?

1:04:25.513 --> 1:04:27.080
Wouldn't waste your breath.

1:04:27.211 --> 1:04:28.908
Why, what's her problem?

1:04:29.039 --> 1:04:30.301
I don't know how long she's
been here,

1:04:30.431 --> 1:04:33.043
but I can tell you
I wouldn't start nothing.

1:04:33.173 --> 1:04:36.133
About a week ago,
one of those guards
thought he'd get cute.

1:04:36.263 --> 1:04:38.875
They yanked her out,
didn't get very far.

1:04:39.005 --> 1:04:41.442
She came back real fast,
blood all over her face.

1:04:41.573 --> 1:04:42.530
Why, what happened?

1:04:42.661 --> 1:04:44.706
Guard tried to get friendly.

1:04:45.142 --> 1:04:46.795
She bit the tongue
out of his mouth.

1:04:51.148 --> 1:04:53.672
Boy, I gotta get out of here.

1:04:53.802 --> 1:04:56.109
We all gotta get out of here.

1:04:56.240 --> 1:04:58.459
Now, ideas, let's hear 'em.

1:05:01.941 --> 1:05:03.551
What about you, Lockport?

1:05:04.857 --> 1:05:06.163
- Lockport?
- Lockport?

1:05:06.293 --> 1:05:07.642
Hey!

1:05:10.602 --> 1:05:12.865
Sorry about that.

1:05:12.996 --> 1:05:16.303
It's just these walls.

1:05:17.652 --> 1:05:20.655
These same goddamn walls.

1:05:22.048 --> 1:05:23.180
It's so cramped in here.

1:05:24.703 --> 1:05:26.661
Even more than before.

1:05:28.533 --> 1:05:30.665
I guess I don't like
being cooped up.

1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:33.668
Pilot for a reason, you know.

1:05:35.279 --> 1:05:38.412
Cap, I'm not liking
the look in his eyes.

1:05:41.850 --> 1:05:43.287
What's that supposed to mean?

1:05:43.417 --> 1:05:46.464
It means I don't know you,

1:05:46.594 --> 1:05:48.205
and I don't know
what to do with you.

1:05:49.423 --> 1:05:51.686
What, you think
I'm some spy?

1:05:52.252 --> 1:05:56.126
All I know is
it was your plane
that shot mine down.

1:05:56.256 --> 1:05:59.085
If you hadn't got captured,
I sure as hell wouldn't be here.

1:05:59.216 --> 1:06:00.173
Well, by the looks of you,

1:06:00.304 --> 1:06:01.261
I'd just assume you're used to

1:06:01.392 --> 1:06:03.437
spending time in a prison cell.

1:06:03.568 --> 1:06:05.352
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey.

1:06:06.310 --> 1:06:08.442
Hank, knock it off.

1:06:11.141 --> 1:06:13.360
Look, I get it,

1:06:13.491 --> 1:06:16.015
it's real tight quarters
and none of us want to be here.

1:06:16.146 --> 1:06:19.976
But we cannot start
playing the blame game
or turning on each other.

1:06:21.455 --> 1:06:23.675
We're all stuck in here.
But out there?

1:06:23.805 --> 1:06:26.069
That's where
the real fight is.

1:06:26.199 --> 1:06:28.854
So let's figure out
how to join it!

1:06:31.291 --> 1:06:32.901
You don't understand, man?

1:06:33.032 --> 1:06:34.991
There is no fight.

1:06:38.342 --> 1:06:39.691
We already lost.

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:42.563
Now it's just...

1:06:44.957 --> 1:06:47.133
biding our time
until the end.

1:07:20.166 --> 1:07:21.428
Shit.

1:07:31.395 --> 1:07:33.440
No, come on.

1:07:41.622 --> 1:07:43.059
No!

1:08:02.252 --> 1:08:03.514
I'm sorry, Jack.

1:08:13.176 --> 1:08:14.220
I'm sorry.

1:08:34.893 --> 1:08:36.503
That's flying too low.

1:08:49.081 --> 1:08:50.126
It's landing.

1:09:06.011 --> 1:09:07.099
Come on.

1:09:13.149 --> 1:09:14.846
It's not over yet, buddy.

1:09:21.374 --> 1:09:24.072
We are on schedule.
As well, we've obtained

1:09:24.203 --> 1:09:27.859
all RAF identification codes
through our contacts in England.

1:09:27.989 --> 1:09:31.515
These codes will be crucial
in safely flying the aircraft
into--

1:09:42.700 --> 1:09:45.355
I see we have
recovered one pilot.

1:09:45.485 --> 1:09:47.052
What happened to your men?

1:09:47.183 --> 1:09:48.445
Did their plane crash, too?

1:09:49.924 --> 1:09:51.839
Sir, we were ambushed.

1:09:51.970 --> 1:09:55.495
Ambushed? By whom?

1:09:55.626 --> 1:09:57.367
An American pilot.

1:09:57.497 --> 1:10:01.458
I shot him down,
but he survived.

1:10:01.588 --> 1:10:03.808
And where is
this pilot now?

1:10:03.938 --> 1:10:05.897
We do not know, sir.

1:10:06.027 --> 1:10:10.293
The major's inability
to dispose of this American

1:10:10.423 --> 1:10:13.209
has cost der Fuhrer
many soldiers today.

1:10:15.254 --> 1:10:19.389
Der Fuhrer does not care
about soldiers like them.

1:10:21.042 --> 1:10:23.088
You should be
far more concerned with me.

1:10:25.656 --> 1:10:29.790
Major Roth, I will send for you
when you are needed.

1:10:29.921 --> 1:10:32.010
Captain Gruber,
please continue your briefing.

1:10:32.140 --> 1:10:36.580
The uniforms from the B-17
bomber crew should fool any RAF
scout planes,

1:10:36.710 --> 1:10:40.410
but we must explain
the missing P-51 fighters
to the Allied ground control.

1:10:40.540 --> 1:10:41.976
- I suggest we say--

1:10:44.501 --> 1:10:48.200
Major, have you decided
to add insubordination

1:10:48.331 --> 1:10:50.420
to your charge
of dereliction of duty?

1:10:52.248 --> 1:10:53.336
What?

1:10:53.466 --> 1:10:55.599
You were
placed on this assignment,

1:10:55.729 --> 1:10:57.862
along with
your arrogant brother,

1:10:57.992 --> 1:10:59.777
because you were the best.

1:11:02.997 --> 1:11:05.173
I knew your brother
was not up to this.

1:11:08.394 --> 1:11:10.396
I'm surprised
he did not kill you both.

1:11:11.571 --> 1:11:14.835
Sir, my brother died bravely--

1:11:14.966 --> 1:11:18.883
Your brother died a failure!

1:11:19.013 --> 1:11:22.060
Be thankful you do not
share his fate.

1:11:23.104 --> 1:11:24.671
Let me find the American.

1:11:24.802 --> 1:11:26.194
He is weak.

1:11:26.325 --> 1:11:29.023
You are the weak one, Major.

1:11:29.154 --> 1:11:30.198
You have caused enough--

1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:38.511
Major, tomorrow morning
you will be sent back to Berlin.

1:11:40.687 --> 1:11:42.820
You will receive
the Iron Cross

1:11:42.950 --> 1:11:45.431
and retire quietly to serve
your Fuhrer in another way.

1:11:47.041 --> 1:11:50.218
Perhaps training
a new generation of pilots

1:11:50.349 --> 1:11:54.701
who someday might be as good
as you... once were.

1:11:57.965 --> 1:12:00.228
I do not want a medal.

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:03.188
I want the American.

1:12:03.319 --> 1:12:07.714
So, give me the night,
I will find the pilot.

1:12:07.845 --> 1:12:10.674
And I will bring his head
back to Berlin as a trophy!

1:12:10.804 --> 1:12:11.805
- But my mission--

1:12:11.936 --> 1:12:15.331
Your mission was
"no survivors!"

1:12:16.897 --> 1:12:19.247
Kampfgeschwader 200
can only exist

1:12:19.378 --> 1:12:21.946
in complete secrecy.

1:12:26.211 --> 1:12:28.213
You are confined
to your quarters.

1:12:28.344 --> 1:12:31.172
I will not see you again.

1:12:45.578 --> 1:12:48.233
Captain, once again
finish your briefing.

1:12:50.104 --> 1:12:52.933
Sir, there is a concern
that the blast radius

1:12:53.064 --> 1:12:54.500
may overtake the aircraft.

1:12:54.631 --> 1:12:56.676
Captain,
keep your mind on the mission.

1:12:56.807 --> 1:12:59.766
Or your next mission
will be on the Russian Front!

1:13:20.744 --> 1:13:23.747
Careful, you fools!
Do you want to kill us all?

1:13:24.574 --> 1:13:26.663
Hurry now! Hurry!

1:13:26.793 --> 1:13:28.316
But gentle, gently...

1:13:28.447 --> 1:13:30.667
But Schnell! Schnell!

1:14:34.818 --> 1:14:36.428
What do they feed these guys?

1:14:40.388 --> 1:14:42.129
These Krauts have to feed us
sooner or later.

1:14:42.260 --> 1:14:44.001
- Yeah.
When they open that door--

1:14:56.666 --> 1:14:57.710
Hello.

1:15:01.453 --> 1:15:03.411
Do you remember us?

1:15:04.717 --> 1:15:06.893
Josef remembers you.

1:15:08.678 --> 1:15:12.638
Why don't you come show him
how sorry you are?

1:15:17.774 --> 1:15:21.168
Poor Josef, he cannot speak,

1:15:21.299 --> 1:15:24.476
but I know
that he likes you very much.

1:15:24.607 --> 1:15:26.217
Don't you like him?

1:15:27.174 --> 1:15:30.395
He is very handsome.

1:15:30.526 --> 1:15:33.093
- Hey, pal, back off!
- Finn.

1:15:35.356 --> 1:15:37.533
Should we give it another try?

1:15:43.713 --> 1:15:45.018
Go to hell!

1:15:47.325 --> 1:15:50.023
Your cooperation
would be very helpful.

1:15:50.284 --> 1:15:54.506
But make no mistake,
we do not need it.

1:15:57.291 --> 1:15:58.379
Oh, hell no!

1:16:00.904 --> 1:16:01.774
Back up!

1:16:06.474 --> 1:16:09.652
Not you.
Come here, sweet girl.

1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:14.613
Hey, you don't have to do this.

1:16:14.744 --> 1:16:16.484
Yeah, take it easy man!

1:16:16.615 --> 1:16:20.532
Put your schwarz dog on a leash
or I'll put him down myself.

1:16:20.663 --> 1:16:23.100
We are here
to take what is ours.

1:16:28.584 --> 1:16:29.497
Hey!

1:16:36.722 --> 1:16:38.071
No! No!

1:16:38.202 --> 1:16:40.204
Get your hands off her,
you filthy Kraut!

1:17:01.965 --> 1:17:04.576
You have made your last mistake.

1:17:33.300 --> 1:17:35.128
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah.

1:17:40.656 --> 1:17:43.267
- What's going on up there?

1:17:43.397 --> 1:17:45.922
- Holden, you're alive!
- Yeah don't act so surprised,
Finn.

1:17:46.052 --> 1:17:47.271
Here.

1:17:49.490 --> 1:17:53.146
- We need to move.
- OK, we go back out
the same way I came in. Alright?

1:17:53.277 --> 1:17:55.235
Hide out in the forest,
hit and run until they
send a rescue--

1:17:55.366 --> 1:17:58.195
There's no time.
Holden, they've got a bomb.

1:17:58.325 --> 1:18:00.980
- A wunderwaffe!
- A what?

1:18:01.111 --> 1:18:03.374
Super weapon.
It can take out an entire city.

1:18:06.116 --> 1:18:07.770
- London.
- What?

1:18:09.249 --> 1:18:10.642
I found their flight-plans.

1:18:10.773 --> 1:18:12.339
I think they're gonna
bomb London.

1:18:12.470 --> 1:18:14.428
The allies
won't know what hit 'em
until it's too late.

1:18:15.299 --> 1:18:17.170
Those bastards!

1:18:17.301 --> 1:18:20.043
They're using my plane
as a goddamn trojan horse!

1:18:22.045 --> 1:18:23.394
Report!

1:18:33.230 --> 1:18:34.579
We can't let them
get away with this.

1:18:34.710 --> 1:18:37.277
OK, look, we need to arm up.
Follow me.

1:18:38.626 --> 1:18:39.627
Who's this?

1:18:43.153 --> 1:18:44.067
I can help.

1:18:46.852 --> 1:18:48.158
Nice to meet you, Marie.

1:18:49.637 --> 1:18:50.813
You guys ready for this?

1:18:54.207 --> 1:18:55.339
Follow me.

1:19:31.984 --> 1:19:33.246
Follow me!

1:19:41.211 --> 1:19:44.562
OK, you two,
Thompson and Armstrong,
give us cover fire.

1:19:44.692 --> 1:19:47.434
We're gonna make it down
to the first floor,
toward the Yankee Lady.

1:19:51.177 --> 1:19:52.483
No matter what happens...

1:19:54.528 --> 1:19:56.052
we do not let her fly.

1:21:46.597 --> 1:21:49.295
Thompson,
that's where they took Harry.

1:21:49.426 --> 1:21:51.210
You think
he's still up there?

1:21:51.341 --> 1:21:53.386
If he is,
we can't just leave him.

1:21:53.517 --> 1:21:55.823
We'll cover you
if you think you can make it.

1:21:59.305 --> 1:22:00.741
I can do this.

1:22:02.091 --> 1:22:03.701
Just don't stop firing.

1:22:09.489 --> 1:22:10.534
Go!

1:23:03.195 --> 1:23:04.457
Coward.

1:23:21.822 --> 1:23:23.650
Auf wiedersehen,
you son of a bitch!

1:23:34.966 --> 1:23:36.707
I'm getting you
the hell out of here, Friedman.

1:23:36.837 --> 1:23:38.013
Armstrong...

1:23:39.710 --> 1:23:42.017
it had to be you.

1:23:42.147 --> 1:23:43.931
Now I'm never gonna
live this down.

1:23:44.062 --> 1:23:46.282
Jesus, what the hell
did they do to your hand?

1:23:46.412 --> 1:23:48.284
Nazi bastards.

1:23:55.987 --> 1:23:59.251
Come on, come on!
OK, get up! Come on, come on!

1:23:59.382 --> 1:24:01.123
Here we go. Come on, buddy.

1:24:01.253 --> 1:24:04.517
Come on, stay with me!
Stay with me! Come on!

1:24:08.782 --> 1:24:12.134
Move it, soldier!
Grab the rail, grab the rail!

1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:39.900
I can't make it!
I can't make it!

1:24:40.031 --> 1:24:41.859
Look at me! Move!

1:25:14.848 --> 1:25:17.242
- No!

1:25:41.962 --> 1:25:45.531
Thompson, get our boys home.

1:25:50.145 --> 1:25:51.320
Go! Come on, Hank.

1:25:51.450 --> 1:25:53.148
Hank, no, no.

1:25:53.278 --> 1:25:55.411
Come on, Hank. Come on!

1:25:59.458 --> 1:26:01.634
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, no!

1:26:01.765 --> 1:26:03.854
No, no, no, no, Armstrong,
come on, buddy!

1:26:03.984 --> 1:26:06.857
Come on, talk to me!
Look at me, buddy, come on!

1:26:06.987 --> 1:26:09.990
Come on!
Come on, you're there, buddy.
Talk to me!

1:26:11.209 --> 1:26:13.690
We'll come back!

1:26:13.820 --> 1:26:16.997
He's gone.
He's gone!

1:26:17.128 --> 1:26:19.870
We need to make sure that
the Yankee Lady stays grounded.

1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.133
Just give me a fucking gun.

1:26:22.264 --> 1:26:25.223
Holden, you stop
the Yankee Lady from taking off.

1:26:25.354 --> 1:26:27.791
- We'll cover you!
- Alright.

1:26:31.621 --> 1:26:33.405
Do not let that bomber
off the ground!

1:26:35.755 --> 1:26:37.017
Go!

1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:32.785
Let's go!

1:28:36.093 --> 1:28:37.312
Home free!

1:28:43.622 --> 1:28:44.797
No.

1:28:45.972 --> 1:28:47.191
No.

1:29:00.770 --> 1:29:01.988
No.

1:29:09.692 --> 1:29:10.910
It is time.

1:29:23.619 --> 1:29:25.534
Move, move, move!

1:30:05.487 --> 1:30:09.099
Well done. I am impressed.

1:30:09.229 --> 1:30:12.537
We're just getting started!

1:30:12.668 --> 1:30:15.018
I'm afraid not.

1:30:15.148 --> 1:30:21.590
I do not know how you escaped,
but, as you can see, it is over.

1:30:22.504 --> 1:30:24.244
You have lost.

1:30:24.375 --> 1:30:26.899
Oh, man,
this does not look good.
What are we gonna do?

1:30:27.030 --> 1:30:29.380
I am sorry,
but I cannot allow you

1:30:29.511 --> 1:30:31.774
to reach your bomber,
my friends.

1:30:32.775 --> 1:30:36.431
But if you come quietly...

1:30:42.045 --> 1:30:45.483
I will show you mercy.

1:30:48.399 --> 1:30:49.574
Throw down your weapons.

1:30:51.707 --> 1:30:52.708
Now.

1:30:54.013 --> 1:30:55.493
I won't go back.

1:30:56.668 --> 1:30:58.148
I won't go back!

1:30:59.366 --> 1:31:01.020
I won't go back!

1:31:01.151 --> 1:31:02.718
Wait!

1:31:08.724 --> 1:31:09.855
Fire!

1:32:09.698 --> 1:32:11.482
No survivors.

1:32:55.570 --> 1:32:58.921
When that .42 stops to reload,
unleash hell.

1:33:00.792 --> 1:33:02.620
Thompson, don't do this.

1:33:02.751 --> 1:33:04.100
You're outta your goddamn mind!
I'm going with you!

1:33:04.230 --> 1:33:06.015
The hell you are!

1:33:12.064 --> 1:33:13.718
The barrels.

1:33:13.849 --> 1:33:15.764
- What?
- Aim for the barrels!

1:33:15.894 --> 1:33:18.636
- What the hell
are you talking about?
- Shoot the bloody barrels!

1:33:34.609 --> 1:33:36.480
Goddamn!

1:33:37.786 --> 1:33:39.091
Oh, we're going home today!

1:35:26.155 --> 1:35:27.547
I'm bringing us home.

1:36:07.631 --> 1:36:08.980
No.

1:36:09.111 --> 1:36:11.461
No, no, no! Shit!

1:36:16.161 --> 1:36:17.075
No...

1:36:39.619 --> 1:36:40.838
Oh, shit.

1:36:40.969 --> 1:36:42.448
Shit,
there's gotta be something.

1:36:43.536 --> 1:36:45.277
What the hell is that thing?

1:36:46.713 --> 1:36:49.542
OK, that I can work with.

1:36:53.372 --> 1:36:54.809
Oh, my God!

1:36:58.247 --> 1:37:00.162
Thompson!

1:37:24.229 --> 1:37:25.752
This ain't over yet.

1:37:30.366 --> 1:37:32.716
Jesus, Cap!

1:37:32.847 --> 1:37:35.458
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine! I'm fine!

1:37:39.375 --> 1:37:40.463
Light em up!

1:37:40.593 --> 1:37:41.899
Oh, hell yeah.

1:38:09.144 --> 1:38:10.493
Give me this!

1:38:10.623 --> 1:38:11.886
Hurry up!

1:38:13.539 --> 1:38:14.540
Locked and loaded.

1:38:16.891 --> 1:38:19.415
This is how
we do it in Brooklyn!

1:38:37.607 --> 1:38:39.826
OK, here we go.

1:38:59.107 --> 1:39:01.152
Hey, Thompson,
we got any more of these?

1:39:02.414 --> 1:39:03.850
We've got one shot.

1:39:05.330 --> 1:39:07.942
They're out of ammunition!

1:39:21.956 --> 1:39:23.131
Oh, shit!

1:39:28.658 --> 1:39:31.269
Oh, this is gonna be good!

1:40:11.396 --> 1:40:13.224
<i>Sieg heil,</i>mother--

1:41:13.545 --> 1:41:16.331
What have you done?!

1:41:16.461 --> 1:41:18.985
You have ruined everything!

1:41:21.640 --> 1:41:24.513
I will tear you apart!

1:41:24.643 --> 1:41:26.384
You are nothing!

1:41:26.515 --> 1:41:28.473
And you are weak!

1:41:33.696 --> 1:41:35.132
You cannot win.

1:41:36.612 --> 1:41:41.095
I win... I win!

1:41:44.141 --> 1:41:45.273
Hey, pal...

1:41:45.403 --> 1:41:47.840
Nein!

1:41:47.971 --> 1:41:49.494
You talk too much.

1:42:13.779 --> 1:42:16.130
Come on, come on,
let's get the hell out of here!

1:42:41.764 --> 1:42:43.113
Go get 'em, Holden.

1:43:04.047 --> 1:43:05.483
My beauty.

1:43:10.184 --> 1:43:12.186
So beautiful.

1:43:33.207 --> 1:43:35.426
Well, I was tired
of escort missions.

1:43:47.612 --> 1:43:49.440
Sir, I think we have a problem.

1:43:49.571 --> 1:43:51.399
What is it?!

1:43:51.529 --> 1:43:54.793
<i>B-17 Wolf Hound</i>
<i>calling B-25 Wild Cargo,</i>

1:43:54.924 --> 1:43:58.057
<i>identify yourself immediately</i>
<i>or you will be fired upon.</i>

1:43:58.188 --> 1:44:01.017
<i>- I repeat, identif--</i>
- That's enough of that.

1:44:03.019 --> 1:44:05.195
All turrets, open fire!

1:44:20.689 --> 1:44:24.954
I said keep this steady!
Do you want to kill us all now?

1:44:27.696 --> 1:44:29.001
Back where I belong.

1:44:49.195 --> 1:44:50.501
Come on...

1:45:00.294 --> 1:45:01.425
What the--?

1:45:27.364 --> 1:45:29.540
We have reinforcements, sir.

1:45:29.671 --> 1:45:32.674
- It's Roth.
- Tell him
to finish his mission.

1:46:00.702 --> 1:46:03.531
Shh... quiet.

1:46:04.575 --> 1:46:06.621
You'll get to make noise soon.

1:46:07.839 --> 1:46:09.972
That fat man Churchill

1:46:10.102 --> 1:46:11.495
will never know what hit him.

1:46:31.689 --> 1:46:35.824
OK, just a little scratch.
Don't worry.

1:46:44.572 --> 1:46:46.400
Ouch...

1:46:46.530 --> 1:46:48.837
OK, maybe we should
worry a little bit.

1:46:58.324 --> 1:46:59.413
Come on!

1:47:11.076 --> 1:47:12.469
Where are you??

1:47:16.255 --> 1:47:17.431
Shit.

1:47:24.394 --> 1:47:25.874
What the hell is he doing?

1:47:32.358 --> 1:47:34.491
Holy shit.

1:47:34.622 --> 1:47:36.798
Oh, he's taking me apart
one piece at a time.

1:47:44.849 --> 1:47:45.850
Shit!

1:47:54.511 --> 1:47:55.773
This ends now.

1:48:57.443 --> 1:48:58.967
Catch this, you son of a bitch.

1:49:25.646 --> 1:49:26.734
Come on! Come on!

1:49:52.020 --> 1:49:53.108
Holy shit.

1:49:54.718 --> 1:49:56.459
Holy shit!

1:50:00.681 --> 1:50:01.899
Come on!

1:50:23.181 --> 1:50:24.705
Whoo!

1:51:48.310 --> 1:51:50.007
No survivors.

1:52:19.254 --> 1:52:20.908
That one was for you, Jack.

1:52:41.624 --> 1:52:43.713
We are coming within range, sir.

1:52:45.019 --> 1:52:46.585
Excellent.

1:52:55.072 --> 1:52:59.076
Alright... let's finish this.

1:53:14.788 --> 1:53:16.093
<i>This is Allied Command.</i>

1:53:16.224 --> 1:53:18.313
<i>Attention inbound aircraft,</i>

1:53:18.443 --> 1:53:20.706
<i>identify yourselves</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

1:53:20.837 --> 1:53:23.057
Boy, we're sure glad
to hear you.

1:53:23.187 --> 1:53:27.017
This is Captain Thompson
with the Yankee Lady
requesting permission to land.

1:53:27.148 --> 1:53:30.499
We've taken heavy damage
and are in need of repair, over.

1:53:30.629 --> 1:53:33.937
<i>Roger, Yankee Lady.</i>
<i>Maintain current approach.</i>

1:53:34.068 --> 1:53:36.984
<i>Emergency ground crews</i>
<i>will be standing by, over.</i>

1:53:37.114 --> 1:53:38.899
Too easy.

1:53:50.998 --> 1:53:53.304
<i>Approaching the drop zone</i>
<i>now, sir.</i>

1:53:53.435 --> 1:53:55.480
<i>Time to target: four minutes.</i>

1:54:12.758 --> 1:54:13.847
What?

1:54:17.589 --> 1:54:19.200
No!

1:54:19.330 --> 1:54:21.898
Come on! Come on!

1:54:22.029 --> 1:54:24.292
I'm out of bullets.

1:54:24.422 --> 1:54:27.599
- No! No! No, no, no!

1:54:56.063 --> 1:54:57.064
No.

1:55:07.248 --> 1:55:08.466
No.

1:55:22.350 --> 1:55:25.222
The 1,000-year Reich
is almost complete.

1:55:30.488 --> 1:55:33.448
Arming sequence initiated,
Colonel Krieger!

1:56:01.606 --> 1:56:03.782
Looks like I'm not
making it home.

1:56:15.185 --> 1:56:16.621
<i>Trust me, kid,</i>

1:56:16.752 --> 1:56:19.146
<i>one man can make</i>
<i>an impact on this war.</i>

1:56:20.495 --> 1:56:22.062
Just maybe not
the way you think.

1:56:44.649 --> 1:56:45.868
This is it.

1:57:00.361 --> 1:57:01.797
"Not the way I think."

1:57:14.679 --> 1:57:16.594
God, I hope this works.

1:57:52.978 --> 1:57:54.719
For der Fuhrer.

1:57:56.243 --> 1:57:58.593
For Deutschland.

1:58:20.223 --> 1:58:21.529
Oh, my God.

1:58:28.231 --> 1:58:30.625
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that worked!

1:58:41.418 --> 1:58:44.726
<i>This is Allied Command</i>
<i>to unidentified B-25 bomber.</i>

1:58:44.856 --> 1:58:48.817
<i>You will be shot down </i>
<i>if you do not </i>
<i>identify yourself immediately.</i>

1:58:48.947 --> 1:58:50.993
<i>Repeat,</i>
<i>you will be shot down---</i>

1:58:51.124 --> 1:58:53.126
Yes! Yes, Allied Command!

1:58:53.256 --> 1:58:54.910
This is Captain David Holden.

1:58:55.040 --> 1:58:58.174
My P-51 was shot down,

1:58:58.305 --> 1:59:00.611
I'm coming in hot
in a recovered B-25.

1:59:01.873 --> 1:59:04.224
Requesting permission to land.

1:59:04.354 --> 1:59:06.139
<i>Welcome back, Captain Holden.</i>

1:59:06.269 --> 1:59:10.186
<i>You and Captain Reynolds</i>
<i>are long overdue.</i>

1:59:10.317 --> 1:59:12.493
<i>We look forward</i>
<i>to your explanation</i>

1:59:12.623 --> 1:59:14.625
<i>of what the devil</i>
<i>is going on up there.</i>

1:59:16.105 --> 1:59:18.412
<i>You are cleared to land.</i>

1:59:31.599 --> 1:59:32.948
Let's go home.

2:00:25.827 --> 2:00:27.568
Excuse me, ma'am.

2:00:27.698 --> 2:00:29.831
Uh, you wouldn't happen to be
Miss Katherine?

2:00:29.961 --> 2:00:31.963
Yes, I am.

2:00:34.966 --> 2:00:37.926
Is this about my fiancé?

2:00:38.056 --> 2:00:39.710
Men already came
a couple months back, and I--

2:00:39.841 --> 2:00:41.582
Yes, this is about Jack.

2:00:48.371 --> 2:00:50.417
My name is Captain David Holden.

2:00:52.114 --> 2:00:53.507
Jack was my wingman.

2:00:56.336 --> 2:00:57.250
I, uh...

2:01:03.386 --> 2:01:04.605
I brought something for you.

2:01:15.180 --> 2:01:17.705
Please, where are my manners?
Come in.

2:01:17.835 --> 2:01:19.359
Uh, no, I really--

2:01:19.489 --> 2:01:21.970
I don't mean to bother you,
ma'am, and I can't stay long.

2:01:26.844 --> 2:01:28.019
I always knew.

2:01:31.066 --> 2:01:32.894
I knew he wasn't coming home.

2:01:36.593 --> 2:01:40.771
I begged him to stay,
but he wouldn't listen.

2:01:42.686 --> 2:01:45.602
Jack had his ways.

2:01:45.733 --> 2:01:47.865
When he made up
his mind about something...

2:01:49.563 --> 2:01:52.261
Believe me, I know.

2:01:55.743 --> 2:01:58.746
In fact, Jack's the reason
why I had that compass
to begin with.

2:01:58.876 --> 2:02:00.051
What do you mean?

2:02:02.706 --> 2:02:04.012
I told Jack...

2:02:06.449 --> 2:02:08.799
that I was worried that we were
never gonna make it back.

2:02:13.369 --> 2:02:15.066
And he said that he
had a lucky charm.

2:02:17.678 --> 2:02:19.636
And he snuck that
in my bag one morning.

2:02:20.855 --> 2:02:22.291
He wouldn't take it back.

2:02:24.598 --> 2:02:26.121
And it wasn't until...

2:02:27.775 --> 2:02:29.254
Well, until after...

2:02:30.255 --> 2:02:32.649
that I found the photo.

2:02:39.743 --> 2:02:42.180
He said that one day
it might save my life.

2:02:44.705 --> 2:02:45.967
Well, it didn't.

2:02:51.015 --> 2:02:52.713
But Captain Reynolds did.

2:02:59.110 --> 2:03:00.242
And, uh--

2:03:00.373 --> 2:03:01.591
Anyway, I just thought that...

2:03:05.378 --> 2:03:06.814
he wanted it to be here.

2:03:07.945 --> 2:03:09.077
With you.

2:03:14.822 --> 2:03:16.563
I should be on my way now.

2:03:17.738 --> 2:03:18.695
Ma'am.

2:03:22.220 --> 2:03:23.352
Thank you.

2:03:27.530 --> 2:03:29.837
Thank you for bringing him
back to me.

2:03:32.622 --> 2:03:33.754
You're welcome.
