Fine. He's the Houdini
of serial killers.

47:42.110 --> 47:44.101
But I've done my research, okay?

47:44.321 --> 47:46.903
None of the punishments
for deadly sins involve poison.

47:47.115 --> 47:50.448
Okay.
What kind of poison was used?

47:53.288 --> 47:55.995
The preliminary report says...

47:56.249 --> 47:59.537
Brodifacou m,
bromadiolone and strychnine.

47:59.753 --> 48:01.835
The Biblical punishment for gluttony

48:02.047 --> 48:06.416
is to be force—fed
rats, toads and snakes.

48:06.634 --> 48:09.467
-Rat poison.
-Indeed.

48:09.679 --> 48:12.591
Yeah, but gluttony...
It doesn't make sense.

48:12.807 --> 48:14.798
Justin could've been on the cover
of a Men's Health magazine.

48:15.018 --> 48:18.101
Gluttony isn't about food,
it's about consumption.

48:18.313 --> 48:20.929
Hedonism. Excess.

48:21.149 --> 48:24.061
Fine. Justin liked to do drugs,
he had a massive habit.

48:24.277 --> 48:26.734
He probably spent more in a week
than I earn in a year.

48:26.946 --> 48:31.861
-Who cares?
-You are absolutely right, who cares?

48:32.077 --> 48:35.069
As with Verna McBride,
there must be something else.

48:35.288 --> 48:37.074
Something hidden.

48:40.502 --> 48:43.585
You've only just scratched
the surface, Sarah.

48:43.797 --> 48:45.628
There's so much more to uncover.

48:45.840 --> 48:49.879
-Trust me.
-Trust you?

48:50.637 --> 48:53.595
I have never lied to you.

48:53.807 --> 48:57.925
But people in this town,
they lie all the time.

49:02.857 --> 49:05.690
Everybody has a secret.

49:07.404 --> 49:11.192
VAUGHN:
Secrets they take to the grave.

49:13.159 --> 49:17.072
Secrets they're willing
to kill to protect.

49:20.500 --> 49:26.211
[ Loud crash, woman screaming ]

49:26.423 --> 49:29.381
[ Melancholy instrumental ]
