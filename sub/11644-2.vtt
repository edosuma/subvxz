Who are you?
Your new probation worker.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.799
What happened
to the other probation worker?

00:06.800 --> 00:10.799
I didn't mean to kill her,
it was an accident!

00:11.240 --> 00:13.199
'So who was it who saved your life?'

00:13.200 --> 00:17.199
Some guy in a mask.

Ah, come on! Who says you can't
have an ASBO and an all-over tan?

Oh, wrong!

(WHISTLES)

02:08.720 --> 02:10.199
I'm looking for Nathan.

02:10.199 --> 02:14.199
Why? Why're you looking for him?
Who are you?

02:14.720 --> 02:17.919
I'm his brother.

02:17.920 --> 02:21.639
I haven't got a brother. I'm
a classic example of an only child.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.199
Not any more.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.719
How is that even possible?

02:24.720 --> 02:28.719
We've got the same dad.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.279
And you're sure about that?

02:31.280 --> 02:33.639
He didn't tell you about me?

02:33.640 --> 02:37.639
I guess it slipped his mind.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.959
Yeah, OK.

02:43.960 --> 02:47.959
I've always wanted a brother.

Oh, hiya, Dad,
it's your son...Nathan.

03:37.720 --> 03:41.319
So here's the thing -
my brother came to see me today.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.799
But I haven't got a brother!
So who's this? It's my brother?

03:44.800 --> 03:47.759
What the fuck?!

03:47.760 --> 03:51.239
Anyway, so, um...call me.

03:51.240 --> 03:55.239
(URINATES)

04:14.320 --> 04:17.199
That is fuckin' disgusting.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.839
Where's Nathan?

04:19.839 --> 04:20.358
He's in the locker room.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.919
Oh, that's funny, because I was
just in there, I didn't see him.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.039
He had a family emergency.
What kind of emergency?

04:27.040 --> 04:28.439
His brother came to see him.

04:28.440 --> 04:29.999
And how is that an emergency?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.639
He's got cancer.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.919
Oh, really?

04:32.920 --> 04:36.919
Yeah, his brother was like
crying and shit. It was really sad.
Think he needed a drink.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.599
Oh, so Nathan's taken him
to the pub, has he?

04:44.760 --> 04:49.159
His brother hasn't
got cancer, has he?
He might have.

04:49.160 --> 04:53.159
He should feel for lumps...
in his testicles.

04:55.080 --> 04:59.079
Right.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.799
So how was it with Dad
when you saw him?

05:01.800 --> 05:04.799
Yeah, it was all right,
you know, it was OK.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.239
Let me take a wild guess -
he was a useless twat?

05:07.240 --> 05:08.799
Pretty much, yeah.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.399
Yeah, that's our dad for you.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.919
Don't take it too personally, though.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.919
Hey, fuck him.

05:24.120 --> 05:28.119
Who's she?

05:29.160 --> 05:33.159
Oh! Let's just say,
been there, boof! Done that.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.239
Beautiful burger nipples.

05:38.240 --> 05:41.399
Like a pair of beef patties.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.679
D'you like that?

05:42.680 --> 05:44.119
Yeah, what's not to like?

05:44.120 --> 05:48.119
I love burgers, I love breasts.
It's like a meal deal!

05:50.440 --> 05:53.359
Another one?

05:53.360 --> 05:57.359
Yeah.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.959
Hey...

06:00.960 --> 06:04.959
Fuck off.

06:07.440 --> 06:11.439
Two pints of your
cheapest lager, please.

06:30.840 --> 06:33.159
So how would you feel
about having sex with me?

06:33.160 --> 06:36.199
I would, but I have
this thing about having sex

06:36.200 --> 06:40.199
with bouffant-haired wankers.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.639
Whoa!

06:47.640 --> 06:50.079
Cool power.

06:50.080 --> 06:53.599
Don't sweat it, I'm immortal.

06:53.600 --> 06:57.599
Seriously?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.039
I thought it was just me.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.359
No, no. I've died twice
in the last two weeks.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.519
Anyway, who are you calling bouffant?

07:05.520 --> 07:07.839
Your hair - it's quite big.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.879
Well, I like to give the ladies
something to hold onto.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.079
That's very thoughtful of you.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.599
I'm a very thoughtful person.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.719
Here, what is it with you
and breaking the glasses?

07:16.720 --> 07:19.199
Sorry.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.239
Clean it up!

07:21.240 --> 07:23.839
Who's the cunt?

07:23.840 --> 07:24.919
THUMP!

07:24.920 --> 07:28.559
What a pussy!
You want me to go back in there
and kick the shit out of him?

07:28.560 --> 07:30.639
No, leave it. Leave it, leave it.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.559
It's probably for the best,
you know? Move on.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.919
Are you all right?
I can't believe he did that.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.639
I feel really bad.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.719
Call me sometime.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.719
Oh. Yeah, I'll do that.

07:47.720 --> 07:51.719
And that, little brother,
is how you pull women.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.239
My car. My car's gone!

08:09.240 --> 08:10.879
What d'you mean?

08:10.880 --> 08:14.879
It was parked, right here,
it's gone!

08:17.800 --> 08:19.719
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.399
Fuck, shit. Shit!

08:21.400 --> 08:23.079
Hey, hey. Could have been worse.

08:23.080 --> 08:27.079
Last week, someone was thrown off
one of those towers. It was carnage.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.919
Dad was in the boot.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.239
Dad? Our Dad?

08:38.240 --> 08:40.318
Why was he in the boot of your car?

08:40.320 --> 08:42.198
Cos he's a twat!

08:42.200 --> 08:44.159
I think I'm going to need a little
bit more information than that.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.679
I went to see him.

08:46.680 --> 08:50.399
It's like he didn't want to
be bothered with me. I lost it.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.159
I hit him with a toaster.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.839
You hit him with a toaster?!

08:53.840 --> 08:56.559
And then you put him
in the boot of your car?!

08:56.560 --> 09:00.039
I was going to make him apologise to
Mum for being such a wanker to her.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.559
Oh, well! I'm sure that
would've been a touching reunion!

09:03.560 --> 09:05.759
I was going to let him out.
And then you say,

09:05.760 --> 09:09.759
"Let's go for a beer." "Sure,
I'll just let Dad out of the boot."

09:10.560 --> 09:12.999
Was he all right
when you put him in there?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.559
He wasn't too happy.

09:14.560 --> 09:18.359
I can't say I'm entirely surprised.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!

09:18.360 --> 09:22.359
Fuck you! He was there for you!
You don't know how this feels!

09:22.360 --> 09:26.359
You don't know!

09:41.480 --> 09:45.479
I suppose we better go
and find our dad.

09:45.569 --> 09:48.968
I spent ages thinking what it would
be like to meet him, you know?

09:48.969 --> 09:50.528
What I'd say or what he'd say.

09:50.529 --> 09:53.728
He didn't even turn the fuckin'
TV off. Fuckin' MasterChef!

09:53.729 --> 09:56.328
Whatever ideas you had
about touching scenes

09:56.329 --> 09:58.808
of father and son, forget about it.

09:58.809 --> 10:02.808
OK? He's not interested.

10:03.409 --> 10:07.408
I'm sorry, man.

10:14.849 --> 10:18.848
Please tell me that's not your car.

10:19.089 --> 10:21.888
(BOTH COUGH)

10:21.889 --> 10:23.408
Is it yours? Is it?!

10:23.409 --> 10:25.928
I don't know! I don't know!
It could be!

10:25.929 --> 10:29.608
Dad!

10:29.609 --> 10:30.848
Ow!

10:30.849 --> 10:34.848
Shit!

10:36.529 --> 10:39.048
Oh, my God, thank you!
Oh, thank you, God.

10:39.049 --> 10:41.288
Jesus.

10:42.889 --> 10:44.368
That's my car!

10:44.369 --> 10:46.368
That...that's my car!

10:46.369 --> 10:49.688
Hey! Our dad's in the boot! Hey!

10:49.689 --> 10:53.688
Our dad's in the boot!

11:10.449 --> 11:12.128
OK, here's the plan -

11:12.129 --> 11:15.648
I'll provoke them into chasing me,
and you get the car. OK?

11:15.649 --> 11:17.648
Yeah?

11:17.649 --> 11:21.648
All right.

11:30.649 --> 11:33.888
Are you doing business?

11:33.889 --> 11:34.768
You want gear?

11:34.769 --> 11:38.328
You want gear?
No, no. The other kind
of business. You know...

11:38.329 --> 11:40.848
You're very cute.

11:40.849 --> 11:44.848
You, not so much, but there's
always room for a little one.

11:46.529 --> 11:47.968
You taking the piss?

11:47.969 --> 11:50.048
Shall we say, er, a hundred quid?

11:50.049 --> 11:53.408
I'm thinking,
I do you, you do me,

11:53.409 --> 11:56.408
we all end up in a hot tub.
All right, all right,

11:56.409 --> 11:58.848
there's an extra 20 in it
if you tie me up

11:58.849 --> 12:00.808
and hit my balls with a cactus.

12:00.809 --> 12:01.848
(LAUGHS)

12:01.849 --> 12:03.808
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS WEAKLY)

12:03.809 --> 12:07.808
(CONTINUES TO LAUGH)

12:17.489 --> 12:19.208
Hundred quid, yeah?

12:19.209 --> 12:23.208
Yep.

12:23.729 --> 12:27.408
Let's go somewhere more private.

12:27.409 --> 12:31.008
OK.

12:43.089 --> 12:47.088
Let's see the money, then, mate.

12:48.529 --> 12:51.568
Let's see your cocks. I want to
know what I'm working with,

12:51.569 --> 12:52.608
so I can prepare...

12:52.609 --> 12:53.688
CAR ENGINE STARTS

12:53.689 --> 12:56.168
mentally and physically...

12:56.169 --> 13:00.168
Give me the fucking money!

13:01.329 --> 13:02.008
Oh, shit!

13:02.009 --> 13:06.008
Oh, shit!
Give me the fucking money.

13:06.649 --> 13:10.648
SHOUTING

13:24.569 --> 13:25.768
Come on!

13:25.769 --> 13:27.248
Can't believe we done that!

13:27.249 --> 13:30.008
We're like the Mitchell brothers,
only we're not bald, ugly and shit!

13:30.009 --> 13:31.528
Go on!

13:31.529 --> 13:35.528
Ha-ha!
(SIGHS WITH RELIEF)

13:35.929 --> 13:39.248
KNOCKING

13:39.249 --> 13:43.248
We should probably let
Dad out of the boot.

13:44.129 --> 13:46.688
Come here, you little
fuckin' bucket of piss!

13:46.689 --> 13:49.088
All right, look, listen.
I'll untie you,

13:49.089 --> 13:52.128
but I want you to
promise me that you won't be angry.

13:52.129 --> 13:54.168
(MUFFLED ANGRY SCREAMING)

13:54.169 --> 13:55.648
OK, he's not going for it.

13:55.649 --> 13:58.328
Come on, now,
let's get him out of there.

13:58.329 --> 13:59.768
(MUFFLED SHOUTING)

13:59.769 --> 14:01.568
Stop wriggling!

14:01.569 --> 14:03.368
SIRENS APPROACH

14:03.369 --> 14:07.368
Ow, stop! Stop!

14:09.089 --> 14:13.088
Shit!

14:19.369 --> 14:20.648
It's complicated.

14:20.649 --> 14:23.088
(SCOFFS)
Try me.

14:23.089 --> 14:25.568
I didn't see the point
in telling you about him.

14:25.569 --> 14:27.528
It would have just upset your mother.

14:27.529 --> 14:29.728
Upset her more than
you cheating on her,

14:29.729 --> 14:33.728
or walking out on us and just
generally being a complete twat?

14:37.609 --> 14:41.608
And you never even
tried to contact him?

14:43.089 --> 14:45.048
Brilliant(!) Yeah.

14:45.049 --> 14:47.688
First class parenting there,
Dad, well done(!)

14:47.689 --> 14:50.368
I thought about seeing him.

14:50.369 --> 14:54.368
The longer it went on, it just...
got harder.

14:54.369 --> 14:57.128
And you wonder why he hit you
in the head with a toaster

14:57.129 --> 14:58.328
and put you in the boot?

14:58.329 --> 15:01.688
He just turned up out of the blue.
I didn't know what to say to him!

15:01.689 --> 15:04.208
(SIGHS)

15:04.209 --> 15:08.208
Even for you,
that is just unbelievably shit.

15:10.489 --> 15:14.048
Like you never got anything wrong.
We're not so different, you know.

15:14.049 --> 15:15.608
We're completely different.

15:15.609 --> 15:18.248
I'm gracefully tall,
you're freakishly short.

15:18.249 --> 15:20.248
Where do you get this stuff?

15:20.249 --> 15:23.128
I don't know, it just comes to me,
I have a gift.

15:23.129 --> 15:26.328
So...what are you
going to do about him?

15:26.329 --> 15:28.008
Well, what am I supposed to do?

15:28.009 --> 15:31.408
You're supposed to be a dad to him.

15:31.409 --> 15:32.888
Well, I don't even know him.

15:32.889 --> 15:36.208
Yeah? What's your excuse with me?

15:36.209 --> 15:38.528
Every time I try to work things
out with you,

15:38.529 --> 15:40.088
you throw it back in my face.

15:40.089 --> 15:43.088
Don't change the subject!
We're talking about your other son!

15:43.089 --> 15:46.408
The little shit should be grateful
I am not pressing charges!

15:46.409 --> 15:48.888
You know what?
He's better off not knowing you!

15:48.889 --> 15:52.888
I wish, I wish I was him!

16:01.009 --> 16:03.648
Where are you going?

16:03.649 --> 16:04.768
That's right, Dad.

16:04.769 --> 16:08.768
Walk away with your tiny little
legs, you fucking midget!

16:12.889 --> 16:16.888
DOOR OPENS

16:17.489 --> 16:18.968
Where's Dad?

16:18.969 --> 16:22.168
He's gone.

16:22.169 --> 16:26.168
Come on.

17:42.689 --> 17:46.688
(PANTS)

17:53.675 --> 17:58.274
See you later?
See you, man.

17:58.275 --> 18:02.034
Is your brother
staying with you?

18:02.035 --> 18:04.274
Yeah. I've always
wanted a brother.

18:04.275 --> 18:05.954
Someone to idolise me.

18:05.955 --> 18:08.554
I can advise him,
teach him stuff.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.034
Like what?

18:10.035 --> 18:12.514
Like, er...

18:12.515 --> 18:15.114
Does he know how to dance?

18:15.115 --> 18:16.954
Do you?

18:16.955 --> 18:20.954
Well, I'll get lessons, cos that's
what brothers do for each other.

18:23.475 --> 18:25.114
You got any brothers?

18:25.115 --> 18:29.114
A sister.

18:29.755 --> 18:33.674
Is she cute? You should think about
getting me and her together.

18:33.675 --> 18:37.674
Hey, man. Someone's going to.
Better it be a close friend.

18:38.435 --> 18:42.434
Someone you trust to be gentle,
and respectful.

18:42.715 --> 18:44.234
Me.

18:44.235 --> 18:45.914
She's 12!

18:45.915 --> 18:49.914
Oh! Probably best to leave it
a couple of years, then.

18:53.835 --> 18:56.154
Something you want
to tell me?

18:56.155 --> 19:00.154
If it's the booze missing from the
kitchen, I know nothing about that!

19:00.875 --> 19:03.914
It's about you disappearing
to the pub yesterday.

19:03.915 --> 19:04.594
Oh...that.

19:04.595 --> 19:06.354
Oh...that.
Yeah!

19:06.355 --> 19:09.154
Forget the booze, then.

19:09.155 --> 19:11.154
Don't take the piss.

19:11.155 --> 19:15.154
I never do.

19:22.155 --> 19:26.154
SNIGGERING

19:28.915 --> 19:32.514
That's not so special!

19:32.515 --> 19:33.794
Whatever!

19:33.795 --> 19:37.394
(CURTIS) Who is this guy?
I don't know. He was following me.

19:37.395 --> 19:42.474
I think he might have sent the note
telling us to go to Nathan's grave.
Does he know about our powers?

19:42.475 --> 19:46.474
Yeah. He kinda reminds me
of the guy who rescued me.

19:47.155 --> 19:50.114
Er...did I miss something?

19:50.115 --> 19:52.954
Oh, yes. I got surrounded
by a whole bunch

19:52.955 --> 19:55.634
of those "virtue" virgins,
right? I was just about

19:55.635 --> 19:59.354
to kick three kinds of shit
out of them...girls included.

19:59.355 --> 20:03.354
This fella swoops in on his BMX, all
dramatic like, and gives me a backie.

20:03.475 --> 20:05.034
He can pedal! I'll give him that.

20:05.035 --> 20:08.394
When were you gonna tell us?
I didn't think it was relevant.

20:08.395 --> 20:12.394
A masked guy appears out
of nowhere and rescues you?
How is that not relevant?

20:12.835 --> 20:15.474
All right, I'm sorry,
I forgot!
LIQUID HISSES

20:15.475 --> 20:18.874
We need to find him.
Look, if he wants to dick around, >

20:18.875 --> 20:22.474
trying to be a super-hero, let him.
Who has time for that shit?

20:22.475 --> 20:26.474
Right! He's just a chancer, chancing
it. What does he actually know?

20:26.515 --> 20:28.514
He seems to know everything.

20:28.515 --> 20:29.834
We're going out tonight.
Are you coming?

20:29.835 --> 20:31.434
We're going out tonight.
Are you coming?
Oh, yeah, cool, man.

20:31.435 --> 20:35.434
I'll bring my little brother.
We are gonna be knee deep in pussy!

20:35.515 --> 20:38.034
You ain't even getting a sniff!

20:38.035 --> 20:41.514
(SCOFFS) Hang on! What's this?!

20:41.515 --> 20:45.514
The phone number of a beautiful girl.
I think someone's getting laid!

20:46.235 --> 20:47.874
And you think I give a shit?

20:47.875 --> 20:51.394
Ooh!

20:51.395 --> 20:55.394
She's so into me and
she doesn't even know it.

21:02.395 --> 21:05.394
I think you should go and see
our useless prick of a dad.

21:05.395 --> 21:06.874
Yeah, right.

21:06.875 --> 21:10.634
Just cos I have a shite relationship
with him doesn't mean you have to.

21:10.635 --> 21:16.034
If he's not interested in you,
why would he be different with me?
Well, you know...

21:16.035 --> 21:19.954
Some would probably say I wasn't
the easiest kid in the world.

21:19.955 --> 21:23.354
(SNIGGERS) Maybe you should try
and sort things out?

21:23.355 --> 21:27.354
Too much shit's happened
between me and him.

21:29.475 --> 21:31.834
I was so jealous of you...

21:31.835 --> 21:35.834
I thought you and him
would be big mates.

21:36.275 --> 21:38.794
My eighth birthday, right.

21:38.795 --> 21:42.794
He's supposed to be taking me out
for the day, so he takes me to IKEA.

21:42.875 --> 21:46.874
He buys so much flat-pack furniture,
there's no room for me in the car,

21:46.915 --> 21:49.514
so he leaves me there
for three hours!

21:49.515 --> 21:53.154
Then some guy with a beard sees me
hanging around and buys me lunch.

21:53.155 --> 21:57.154
I spent my eighth birthday
eating Swedish meatballs
with a known paedophile!

21:57.395 --> 21:59.114
Did he...?

21:59.115 --> 22:01.954
No, no! Dad got back as we were
finishing our ice cream,

22:01.955 --> 22:05.954
but that sick pervert cared
more about me than Dad ever did.

22:08.035 --> 22:12.034
He would've taken me to the zoo.

22:37.675 --> 22:41.674
ENGINE STARTS

22:47.275 --> 22:48.514
What?

22:48.515 --> 22:50.274
Nothing.

22:50.275 --> 22:52.754
# THE CHEMICAL BROTHERS:
Swoon

22:52.755 --> 22:55.394
# There's nothing else

22:55.395 --> 22:59.234
# Just remember to fall in love

22:59.235 --> 23:02.354
# There's nothing else

23:14.715 --> 23:17.754
# There's nothing else
There's nothing else... #

23:17.755 --> 23:21.754
THE SONG CONTINUES

23:37.915 --> 23:41.914
MUSIC DROWNS OUT SPEECH

23:43.075 --> 23:47.074
Hey, hey! >

23:47.995 --> 23:51.994
Hey! Hey, these are my friends!

23:52.315 --> 23:54.194
I'm not your friend.

23:54.195 --> 23:57.674
Hey, you look even prettier
in the dark.

23:57.675 --> 23:58.714
That's original!

23:58.715 --> 24:00.154
That's original!
Jesus!

24:00.155 --> 24:03.194
Sorry. I'm trying not
to be such a cold bitch.

24:03.195 --> 24:05.474
Cold. As in, you know. frigid?

24:05.475 --> 24:07.594
I have intimacy issues, OK?

24:07.595 --> 24:09.874
OK, OK! In my experience,

24:09.875 --> 24:13.874
there isn't any problem that can't be
solved by getting really drunk.

24:20.995 --> 24:24.994
Hey, my brother doesn't know anything
about the whole power thing, so...

24:25.795 --> 24:29.794
Cheers, man.
All right, man.

24:33.595 --> 24:37.594
You all right?
Very!

24:40.395 --> 24:42.874
You up for a pill?
Yeah, thanks.

24:42.875 --> 24:46.874
You can have two.

24:48.915 --> 24:50.034
Cheers.

24:50.035 --> 24:52.034
I don't take drugs.

24:52.035 --> 24:54.754
Right.

24:54.755 --> 24:58.754
What's that?

25:00.715 --> 25:02.234
What?

25:02.235 --> 25:06.594
Nothing. Have a good night, man.
Thanks.

25:06.595 --> 25:10.274
# Just remember to fall in love

25:10.275 --> 25:13.994
# There's nothing else
There's nothing else... #

25:13.995 --> 25:17.994
MUSIC CHANGES,
THE CROWD CHEERS

25:48.715 --> 25:50.754
So how are we gonna do this?

25:50.755 --> 25:53.954
They're not cattle!
Show them some respect!

25:53.955 --> 25:56.194
Just choose one!

25:56.195 --> 26:00.194
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
Catch a liar by the toe.

26:00.195 --> 26:04.194
If she hollers, let her go.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!

26:07.795 --> 26:09.874
Oh, fine! You have the pretty one!

26:09.875 --> 26:12.714
Sweet!
Yeah!

26:12.715 --> 26:16.714
Yeah, yeah, whatever!

26:18.435 --> 26:21.154
I thought she was with you?

26:21.155 --> 26:24.554
Who?

26:24.555 --> 26:27.954
No! That was just an elaborate
plan to make you jealous.

26:27.955 --> 26:34.194
I can't even remember her name.
You don't remember anyone's name.

26:36.035 --> 26:39.154
There's some seriously weird shit
going on with your eyes!

26:39.155 --> 26:42.914
I think this pill's kicking in.
Why're you interested in me?

26:42.915 --> 26:45.474
You can get loads of prettier girls.
No, I didn't mean to say that.

26:45.475 --> 26:49.474
So what if there are? I like you
and...there's no explaining that.

26:50.115 --> 26:53.634
What if you think I'm shit in bed?
I've only slept with four blokes.

26:53.635 --> 26:55.554
Seriously?

26:55.555 --> 26:57.474
Yeah!

26:57.475 --> 27:01.114
You're practically a virgin.
Hey, I respect that!

27:01.115 --> 27:05.114
This pill's doing something
weird to my power, making me
say what's in my head.

27:05.275 --> 27:08.154
Sometimes, I think I fucking
love you.

27:08.155 --> 27:11.714
It's not me.It scares me, cos
I know you'll end up hurting me,

27:11.715 --> 27:15.554
like most blokes do, cos you're
a useless prick, just like your dad.

27:15.555 --> 27:19.554
I did eeny, meeny, miny, moe,
and you lost, and I still chose you!

27:20.235 --> 27:24.234
But now I'm changing my mind.
Jamie can have you, and I'm having...

27:24.875 --> 27:27.874
..the pretty one!

27:27.875 --> 27:31.874
Nathan?

27:52.155 --> 27:56.154
Get off me, you skanky bitch!

27:57.435 --> 27:59.794
(MAN) Oi, you skank!
(2ND MAN) Filthy bitch!

27:59.795 --> 28:03.794
(WOMAN) You minger!
(MAN) Dirty little skank!

28:06.155 --> 28:10.154
(GASPS)

28:20.635 --> 28:23.394
Hey.

28:23.395 --> 28:27.274
I was just thinking about you.

28:27.275 --> 28:29.594
What're you doing?

28:29.595 --> 28:32.994
I don't want to get
come on my dress.

28:32.995 --> 28:36.994
It's dry clean only.

28:46.155 --> 28:49.634
No...

28:49.635 --> 28:51.274
I can't do this.

28:51.275 --> 28:55.274
What?

28:58.915 --> 29:02.474
(GASPS)

29:02.475 --> 29:06.474
Alisha!

29:15.755 --> 29:19.354
You're fucking amazing!

29:19.355 --> 29:23.354
Dance with me.

30:01.475 --> 30:04.834
Fuck!

30:04.835 --> 30:08.834
Fella in the next cubicle.
You got any toilet roll in there?

30:09.115 --> 30:11.234
Nathan? It's me.

30:11.235 --> 30:15.234
Barry? Hey, man.
Help me out!

30:16.355 --> 30:19.474
Something weird's happening.
Everyone's looking at me.

30:19.475 --> 30:23.474
That'll be the pills. Kelly said
it did something to her powers.

30:24.035 --> 30:25.674
I didn't take one.

30:25.675 --> 30:28.994
I think my brother
may have spiked you.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.514
Well, I know he did.

30:30.515 --> 30:33.874
When you say everyone
was looking at you...

30:33.875 --> 30:36.834
..do you mean girls?

30:36.835 --> 30:40.794
Everyone. It's like
it's reversed my power.

30:40.795 --> 30:44.794
Want my advice? Find a nice,
sweet, innocent girl
and take advantage of her

30:45.235 --> 30:47.274
I can't use a power like that.

30:47.275 --> 30:51.274
I really don't see it
happening for you otherwise.

30:51.435 --> 30:54.074
Maybe we need to build up
your confidence first.

30:54.075 --> 30:57.754
Let's get you a prostitute.
There's a girl on the estate, right.

30:57.755 --> 31:01.714
She's not all that looks wise, not
since the accident, but looks clean.

31:01.715 --> 31:04.354
Clean enough for what you want.

31:04.355 --> 31:06.594
TOILET FLUSHES
Have you seen Lily?

31:06.595 --> 31:09.434
I think she went
outside with Jamie.

31:09.435 --> 31:12.354
That's supposed to be me
getting into her knickers!

31:12.355 --> 31:13.554
Nathan...

31:13.555 --> 31:16.674
Make sure you don't get killed.

31:16.675 --> 31:20.674
Nathan?!

31:50.315 --> 31:54.314
I feel really weird!

31:55.075 --> 31:57.394
I'm burning up!

31:57.395 --> 31:58.154
I'm so hot!

31:58.155 --> 31:59.674
I'm so hot!
Let me have a look at you.

31:59.675 --> 32:01.554
(PANTS)

32:01.555 --> 32:05.074
You're fine.

32:05.075 --> 32:09.074
You're beautiful.

32:19.155 --> 32:23.154
Oh...ah...

32:23.315 --> 32:27.314
LAUGHTER AND CHATTER

32:37.875 --> 32:40.154
(GROANING)

32:40.155 --> 32:44.154
(PANTING)

32:48.475 --> 32:52.474
Get off me!

32:58.435 --> 33:02.434
Jamie! Jamie!

33:02.875 --> 33:05.714
Jamie!

33:05.715 --> 33:07.074
Get off me!

33:07.075 --> 33:11.074
My brother's in there!
My brother's in there!

33:11.875 --> 33:14.834
Jamie!

33:14.835 --> 33:16.434
Jamie!

33:16.435 --> 33:20.434
(VOICE BREAKS) Jamie!
Jamie!

33:21.475 --> 33:23.154
Jamie!

33:23.155 --> 33:25.074
Oh...

33:25.075 --> 33:29.074
I thought you were dead,
you stupid bastard!

35:56.172 --> 36:00.011
She just started freaking out.

36:00.012 --> 36:03.491
Then she threw me out of the car.

36:03.492 --> 36:06.211
She's dead, man.

36:06.212 --> 36:07.971
There was nothing I could do.

36:07.972 --> 36:11.971
This isn't down to you.
This is just one of those...

36:12.372 --> 36:14.371
..just totally fucked-up situations.

36:14.372 --> 36:16.851
Who knew that would happen? >

36:16.852 --> 36:20.571
What's with her bursting into
flames like that? That's not normal.

36:20.572 --> 36:22.211
Yeah, there was a storm. >

36:22.212 --> 36:25.371
Bunch of us got superpowers.

36:25.372 --> 36:29.011
I'm immortal.

36:29.012 --> 36:32.211
Big reveal.

36:32.212 --> 36:33.251
Seriously?

36:33.252 --> 36:36.491
Yeah.

36:36.492 --> 36:40.491
Oh, I feel like shit.

36:41.852 --> 36:43.971
I've been thinking.

36:43.972 --> 36:46.251
You were right.

36:46.252 --> 36:49.371
I should try and
sort things out with Dad.

36:49.372 --> 36:50.971
Will you come and see him with me?

36:50.972 --> 36:54.051
I can't see that helping anybody,

36:54.052 --> 36:56.451
least of all me.

36:56.452 --> 36:58.611
You'll be fine.
You'll get on with him.

36:58.612 --> 37:01.691
I hit him with a toaster and
locked him in the boot of my car.

37:01.692 --> 37:04.331
OK, yeah, so it's going to
be a bit awkward at first.

37:04.332 --> 37:06.211
We've all been there.

37:06.212 --> 37:09.211
Well, maybe not there,
but somewhere similar.

37:09.212 --> 37:11.571
Just gloss over it.

37:11.572 --> 37:15.571
I don't know what to say to him.

37:16.772 --> 37:20.771
Come on, man. Do this one thing.
Come with me.

37:22.932 --> 37:26.931
No.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.131
You know, the worst thing about it -

37:29.132 --> 37:31.491
it wasn't any different to
my normal power.

37:31.492 --> 37:33.091
Either way, I'm untouchable.

37:33.092 --> 37:37.451
Don't say that.
It's true.

37:37.452 --> 37:39.491
What did you see
when you went forward?

37:39.492 --> 37:43.491
I was standing on a roof,
like I was going to jump off it.

37:46.852 --> 37:49.851
I was just a superhero.

37:49.852 --> 37:51.971
You're saying you've
become a superhero?

37:51.972 --> 37:55.011
Dunno.

37:55.012 --> 37:59.011
Then what happened?

37:59.612 --> 38:03.611
Nothing.

38:28.852 --> 38:29.891
Ow!

38:29.892 --> 38:33.891
Fucker.

38:46.532 --> 38:48.251
Why did you hit me?

38:48.252 --> 38:52.171
Cos I panicked.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

38:52.172 --> 38:54.771
Tell him.

38:54.772 --> 38:56.451
OK, look.

38:56.452 --> 38:59.291
I know it's too late for me and you.
I get that.

38:59.292 --> 39:01.091
I've known you didn't give a shit

39:01.092 --> 39:03.371
ever since you left me in IKEA
with that paedophile.

39:03.372 --> 39:04.931
What paedophile?

39:04.932 --> 39:07.171
My eighth birthday. IKEA!

39:07.172 --> 39:09.611
The guy with the Swedish meatballs?

39:09.612 --> 39:11.051
I don't remember that.

39:11.052 --> 39:12.851
How very convenient.

39:12.852 --> 39:15.211
Is this about the guy
who was seeing your mum

39:15.212 --> 39:17.651
who you said was trying to
sexually abuse you?

39:17.652 --> 39:20.051
No, I made that up!
This is something else.

39:20.052 --> 39:21.611
IKEA paedophile!

39:21.612 --> 39:24.011
Jesus, meatballs!

39:24.012 --> 39:28.011
This isn't about who was or who
wasn't trying to sexually abuse me.

39:28.372 --> 39:30.331
It's about you and Jamie.

39:30.332 --> 39:33.091
So I'm pretty much
a complete write-off. That's fine.

39:33.092 --> 39:33.491
Nathan...

39:33.492 --> 39:35.691
Nathan...
Whatever.
And so he hit you with a toaster

39:35.692 --> 39:39.691
and kidnapped you, but you know what
they say? Don't fuck a wounded bear!

39:49.252 --> 39:53.251
Jamie's dead.

39:53.612 --> 39:56.211
He's standing right there.

39:56.212 --> 39:59.691
What?

39:59.692 --> 40:03.691
It caught fire.

40:05.892 --> 40:09.891
I've just had to go
and identify his body.

40:13.292 --> 40:17.291
MOBILE BUZZES

40:17.292 --> 40:21.291
This is his mother.
I've got to talk to her.

40:23.852 --> 40:27.851
Hi.

40:30.452 --> 40:31.971
You're dead?

40:31.972 --> 40:35.971
Yeah.

40:45.932 --> 40:48.091
So how come I can see you?

40:48.092 --> 40:52.091
I guess it's cos you're immortal.

40:53.852 --> 40:56.731
No, this isn't happening. No.

40:56.732 --> 40:59.571
I can fix this.
How do I fix this?

40:59.572 --> 41:00.531
You can't.

41:00.532 --> 41:03.371
You can't.
I don't want you to die, mate.

41:03.372 --> 41:06.451
It wasn't down to you...

41:06.452 --> 41:08.771
..so don't go all mental about it.

41:08.772 --> 41:12.771
To be honest, it's not so bad.

41:13.612 --> 41:17.611
So if you're dead,
what am I doing here, exactly?

41:18.292 --> 41:22.291
I wanted you to
sort things out with Dad.

41:24.932 --> 41:28.691
Look, no offence, but I think it's
going to take more than you dying

41:28.692 --> 41:31.171
to fix years of resentment,
missed birthdays

41:31.172 --> 41:35.171
and all that dysfunctional bullshit,
but it was a lovely thought(!)

41:36.172 --> 41:40.171
(SNIFFLES)

41:43.932 --> 41:47.931
Look at him.

42:02.612 --> 42:06.611
I went to the hospital
when Jamie was born.

42:07.652 --> 42:11.651
His mum was asleep.

42:12.852 --> 42:16.851
I was just standing there,
looking down at him.

42:19.212 --> 42:22.291
I thought I had to choose.

42:22.292 --> 42:26.291
I chose you and your mum. >

42:31.252 --> 42:35.251
They didn't even know I was there.

42:38.452 --> 42:42.451
I thought I was
doing the right thing.

42:46.452 --> 42:48.931
I wasn't there for either of you.

42:48.932 --> 42:52.931
I was a selfish prick.

42:55.852 --> 42:59.851
I'm sorry, Nathan.

43:03.172 --> 43:06.771
You want this, so don't be a dick.

43:06.772 --> 43:12.691
I will haunt you
for the rest of your life.
All right!

43:18.092 --> 43:22.091
I'm starving.

43:26.172 --> 43:30.171
Do you want to buy me breakfast
or not?

43:33.812 --> 43:37.811
Yeah, OK. OK.

43:42.372 --> 43:44.211
So, can I drive?

43:44.212 --> 43:45.891
Have you passed your test?

43:45.892 --> 43:48.011
Have I passed my test?!
I give the tests!

43:48.012 --> 43:49.411
So you haven't.

43:49.412 --> 43:53.411
No.

44:04.412 --> 44:08.411
(I'm fucking her).

44:12.252 --> 44:15.491
What?

44:15.492 --> 44:19.491
Nothing.

44:36.212 --> 44:37.251
Hey.

44:37.252 --> 44:40.891
Where've you been?

44:40.892 --> 44:44.291
You know, just hanging out
with my dead brother.

44:44.292 --> 44:45.571
What are you talking about?

44:45.572 --> 44:49.131
I see dead people.

44:49.132 --> 44:53.131
So there's a thing.

44:54.372 --> 44:58.371
I'm sorry to hear about Jamie, yeah?

45:01.212 --> 45:05.211
You were there for him.

45:11.332 --> 45:13.131
(CLEARS THROAT) >

45:13.132 --> 45:14.371
The guy in the mask.

45:14.372 --> 45:17.011
I followed him.
I know where he lives. >

45:17.012 --> 45:19.811
Yeah?
What do you want us to do about it?

45:19.812 --> 45:23.811
I think we should go
round there and talk to him.

45:33.652 --> 45:37.651
This is it.

45:42.492 --> 45:46.491
So what do we do now?

45:48.492 --> 45:49.411
Jesus!

45:49.412 --> 45:51.131
Jesus!
Oh, subtle(!)

45:51.132 --> 45:55.131
I'm sure no-one heard that.

46:09.332 --> 46:10.811
This is a girl's bedroom.

46:10.812 --> 46:13.971
So now we're saying
he's a cross-dresser?

46:13.972 --> 46:15.531
Something's wrong.

46:15.532 --> 46:17.891
I'm going to take a shit in his bed.

46:17.892 --> 46:18.531
What?!

46:18.532 --> 46:20.691
What?!
I don't think you should do that.

46:20.692 --> 46:24.051
We need to send a message.
Let him know he can't fuck with us.

46:24.052 --> 46:26.371
How does taking a shit
in his bed do that?

46:26.372 --> 46:27.891
They did it in The Godfather.

46:27.892 --> 46:30.691
They put a horse's head in the bed.

46:30.692 --> 46:34.691
Well, have you got a horse's head?

46:51.452 --> 46:53.131
This isn't his flat.

46:53.132 --> 46:54.611
So why did he lead us here?

46:54.612 --> 46:57.451
Maybe he knew I was following him.

46:57.452 --> 47:01.451
I'm done.

47:04.332 --> 47:05.891
Who are you?

47:05.892 --> 47:07.651
Why are you in my flat?

47:07.652 --> 47:09.131
It's you.

47:09.132 --> 47:13.131
Someone grab me some toilet paper?

47:15.772 --> 47:17.651
'I love him.'

47:17.652 --> 47:19.651
Are you telling me you're gay?

47:19.652 --> 47:22.811
Gay, straight, retarded,
why do we have to label everything?

47:22.812 --> 47:24.571
I feel like I know you.

47:24.572 --> 47:28.571
You can help yourself.

47:29.772 --> 47:33.771
You're...touching me.
Who are you?
