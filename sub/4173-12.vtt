00:02.084 --> 00:05.463
KATIE: The opening ceremony of the
Bee Day festival was awesome!

00:05.463 --> 00:08.048
It's my favorite part of
Bee Awareness Day.

00:08.048 --> 00:09.425
My favorite part
is the B-flat

00:09.425 --> 00:12.345
with an F-sharp bass
at the end of the song.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.805
What?
It's tradition.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.473
Okay, girls,
festivities are over.

00:15.473 --> 00:18.100
Let's focus on getting
our Beekeeping Patches.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.311
It's the only patch that we've
ever tried to get and failed.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.438
Remember last year?

00:22.438 --> 00:25.441
You promised to never flash
back on that ever again!

00:25.441 --> 00:26.984
Right! Right.
You're right.

00:26.984 --> 00:28.986
But still, if we
don't succeed today

00:28.986 --> 00:30.571
the "two strikes and
you're out" rule kicks in.

00:30.571 --> 00:32.323
Which means this spot
will stay empty

00:32.365 --> 00:35.117
on all of our
sashes forever!

00:35.117 --> 00:37.328
Chill out, Isabella.
We've got this.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.247
Ready, girls?

00:39.247 --> 00:40.832
ALL: They're gone!

00:40.832 --> 00:42.250
Gone?

00:42.250 --> 00:45.461
Fighting flash-forward
to potential catastrophe.

00:45.461 --> 00:47.088
Hey, where's Pinky?

00:51.342 --> 00:52.510
(BARKING)

00:55.012 --> 00:56.514
<i>ACRONYM: Good afternoon,
Agent Pinky!</i>

00:56.514 --> 01:00.351
<i>I see you've token our new
handbag conveyor system.</i>

01:00.393 --> 01:02.395
<i>Carla here has intel that
Poofenplotz has been</i>

01:02.395 --> 01:05.355
<i>hatching up some sort of
bee-related evil scheme.</i>

01:05.355 --> 01:08.484
<i>Yes, it seems that
Poofenplotz is researching</i>

01:08.484 --> 01:10.361
<i>the use of royal jelly
in the bee community.</i>

01:10.403 --> 01:12.154
<i>(BEEPING)
Oh, there's your coffee.</i>

01:12.154 --> 01:16.033
<i>She comes from on entire
family of unpaid interns.</i>

01:16.033 --> 01:17.535
<i>Anyway, see if
there is anything</i>

01:17.535 --> 01:19.370
<i>to Carla's research,
Agent Pinky.</i>

01:19.412 --> 01:20.997
<i>Admiral Acronym out.</i>

01:24.417 --> 01:26.127
Gah! We've gotta
find those bees

01:26.127 --> 01:28.170
before the sun
goes down, but how?

01:28.170 --> 01:30.047
In the guidelines for
the Beekeeping Patch,

01:30.047 --> 01:31.382
it says that
a good beekeeper

01:31.424 --> 01:32.550
tries to think
like a bee!

01:32.550 --> 01:34.427
(BUZZING)

01:36.137 --> 01:38.931
What are you doing?
I'm thinking like a bee!

01:38.931 --> 01:41.392
I know! We could get stung
by radioactive bees

01:41.392 --> 01:43.644
and gain bee-themed
superpowers!

01:43.644 --> 01:47.315
Um, we don't have access
to radioactive bees.

01:47.315 --> 01:50.067
Yeah, that's what's
wrong with that plan.

01:50.067 --> 01:52.069
But we do have access
to Phineas and Ferb,

01:52.069 --> 01:53.946
and they have access
to a sorbet machine

01:53.946 --> 01:57.658
They've gotta be able to modify
it to turn people into bees.

01:57.658 --> 01:59.577
Phineas and Ferb have
a sorbet machine

01:59.577 --> 02:01.287
that turns people
into flies?

02:01.287 --> 02:02.455
Katie,
for crying out loud!

02:02.455 --> 02:04.415
Look it up
on the Internet.

02:04.415 --> 02:07.418
<i>CHORUS:</i> (SINGING) <i>Poofenplotz

02:07.418 --> 02:09.419
Let's see.
Bill, bill, flyer...

02:09.419 --> 02:13.966
Ooh! This must be my acceptance
letter into Love Muffin!

02:13.966 --> 02:16.552
Ooh! Open, open, ah!

02:16.552 --> 02:18.346
"Dear Esmeralda Poofenplotz."

02:18.346 --> 02:20.097
Ooh, that sounds
promising.

02:20.097 --> 02:22.934
"We regret to
inform you that..." Oh...

02:22.934 --> 02:25.353
Reject me, will they?
No matter.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.605
My newest evil scheme
is sure to catch

02:27.605 --> 02:29.941
the attention of that
silly boys' club.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.193
Pinky the Chihuahua?

02:32.193 --> 02:33.736
(GROWLS AND BARKS)

02:33.736 --> 02:36.238
Fortunately,
I was expecting you.

02:36.238 --> 02:37.490
(BEEPING)

02:37.490 --> 02:39.450
My makeup case,
it doubles as a trap!

02:39.450 --> 02:41.452
Could you hand me
that lipstick in there?

02:41.452 --> 02:44.246
What are friends for
if not to reconfigure

02:44.246 --> 02:46.123
a sorbet machine that
turns people into flies

02:46.123 --> 02:48.459
into a sorbet machine
that turns people into bees?

02:48.459 --> 02:51.504
Just remember the effect wea rs
off after a couple of hours.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.090
Why don't you come back for our
inflatable wading pool party

02:54.090 --> 02:55.383
after your
patch ceremony?

02:55.383 --> 02:56.467
Of course!
Wouldn't miss it!

02:56.467 --> 02:57.760
See you later then.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.387
Did you know that
bees can communicate

02:59.387 --> 03:01.013
with each other
through dancing?

03:01.013 --> 03:02.723
That's really
interesting.

03:02.723 --> 03:05.267
Yes, they do
a tail wagging dance

03:05.267 --> 03:07.478
to alert each other
to the source of food.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.521
The waggle explains...
Okay, let's see.

03:08.521 --> 03:12.400
Setting targets.
Fireside Girls.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.651
And that should do it!

03:13.651 --> 03:15.486
(BEEPING)
Here we go!

03:15.528 --> 03:17.154
PHINEAS: Mind giving me a hand with...
In a minute.

03:17.154 --> 03:19.991
So, to continue,
the figure-eight dan...

03:21.158 --> 03:22.243
Aw!

03:22.243 --> 03:24.286
And we are back.

03:29.291 --> 03:32.044
Fireside Bees!
Follow your noses!

03:32.044 --> 03:33.170
(SNIFFING)

03:33.170 --> 03:35.172
ALL: That way!

03:35.172 --> 03:38.259
Mmm. Much better.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.177
Now that my lips
are taken care of,

03:40.177 --> 03:43.305
I can tell you about my
beautifully evil plan.

03:43.305 --> 03:45.516
Bad doggie! Okay, sit.

03:46.308 --> 03:47.435
That's better.

03:47.435 --> 03:52.314
Slowly moves closer and we
cross-dissolve to my thoughts.

03:52.314 --> 03:54.316
<i>Behold,
the humble bee hive.</i>

03:54.316 --> 03:57.445
<i>A massively ordered society,
just like our own.</i>

03:57.445 --> 04:01.323
<i>Observe, u young grub being fed
moss quantities of royal jelly,</i>

04:01.323 --> 04:02.575
<i>which will make her larger,</i>

04:02.575 --> 04:05.536
<i>and eventually she
will become their queen.</i>

04:05.536 --> 04:08.539
<i>So logic dictates that
if I were to consume</i>

04:08.539 --> 04:10.332
<i>massive amounts
of royal jelly,</i>

04:10.332 --> 04:11.542
<i>then I would grow
forty times bigger</i>

04:11.584 --> 04:13.335
<i>and live forty times longer</i>

04:13.335 --> 04:16.213
<i>and eventually be crowned
Queen of the World!</i>

04:16.213 --> 04:17.464
<i>The Queen!</i>

04:17.464 --> 04:19.091
And I shall
not be dark,

04:19.091 --> 04:21.343
but beautiful like
the night and the day!

04:21.343 --> 04:24.847
And all shall
love me and despair!

04:24.847 --> 04:27.224
<i>And I might hove
o grotesquely large abdomen</i>

04:27.224 --> 04:29.226
<i>for laying eggs,
but I could live with that.</i>

04:29.226 --> 04:31.562
(SQUEAKING) Come,
Pinky the Chihuahua.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.440
To the Myselficopter.
(MANIACAL LAUGH)

04:38.069 --> 04:39.361
ISABELLA: My bee instincts
are buzzing.

04:39.361 --> 04:41.572
This must be where
our bees went.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.075
They must have been attracted
to that heavenly scent.

04:44.075 --> 04:47.453
MILLIE: It seems to be coming from
that gigantic perfume sprayer.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.246
GRETCHEN:
Let's check it out!

04:49.246 --> 04:51.457
Whoa! It looks like every
bee in Danville is here.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.501
Fireside Girls,
forward buzz!

04:53.501 --> 04:56.253
Ha-ha!
Sucks to "bee" you!

04:56.253 --> 04:57.379

Oops! I almost hit the
self-destruct button here.

Wow, humans really
take for granted

05:04.595 --> 05:07.223
not being sucked into the
nearest vacuum cleaner.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.141
I'm gonna see if the
queen knows anything.

05:09.141 --> 05:10.267
Excuse me,
Your Majesty,

05:10.267 --> 05:12.269
do you have any idea
how to get out?

05:12.269 --> 05:15.648
Not a clue, and without my
jelly, I'm way too weak to fly.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.525
What do you think,
Fireside Girls?

05:17.525 --> 05:19.443
What are we
supposed to do now?

05:19.443 --> 05:23.322
Bee Day's almost over, and we're stuck
inside a pharmacist's power vac.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.616
What? Over?
Did you say "over"?

05:25.616 --> 05:28.244
Nothing is over
until we decide it is!

05:28.244 --> 05:29.370
Was it over
when we helped Candace

05:29.370 --> 05:31.831
get 5O patches
in one day? Heck no!

05:31.831 --> 05:33.457
I thought it was only 49.

05:33.457 --> 05:34.875
Forget it. She's rolling.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.628

when the going gets tough,

05:39.130 --> 05:40.631

05:40.631 --> 05:42.466
Come on, girls,
we've got enough patches

05:42.466 --> 05:44.260
between all of us
to make this work.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.262
We can do this!

05:46.262 --> 05:48.389
Gretchen, Millie, Katie, you've
got the Exploring Patch, right?

05:48.389 --> 05:50.474
Yeah! So we can look for
the way back out of here.

05:50.474 --> 05:51.767
ALL: Right!

05:51.767 --> 05:55.646
Holly, Ginger, you girls have
the Advanced Knot-tying Patch.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.648
What do you think? We could
totally work with that stuff.

05:57.648 --> 05:59.400
And make a sling
for the queen.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.902
And Adyson, you and I have
the Appliance Repair Patch.

06:01.902 --> 06:04.238
Let's hotwire the vacuum
and reverse the motor

06:04.238 --> 06:05.406
so that it blows us
all out again!

06:05.406 --> 06:07.491
That's what
I'm talkin' about!

06:07.491 --> 06:09.785
All we need to do
is swap those leads

06:09.785 --> 06:11.412
to the forward-reverse switch.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.289
Great!
How's that sling coming?

06:13.289 --> 06:14.373
ALL: All good to go!

06:14.373 --> 06:15.666

them back into their hive.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.296
Okay, little bees,
go back into your hive.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.715

We can't communicate.

Ooh! I have my Semaphore Patch.
Would that work?

07:07.468 --> 07:09.220
Only if they were
on a boat.

isn't the time to...

all about this dance

they do to alert each other to
a source of food or shelter.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.355

No, it's a waggle dance.

Yeah, but also tells
the bees the distance

08:50.821 --> 08:56.452
That's the last time I buy a cheap
designer knock-off trap from downtown.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.704
(GASPS) I don't believe it!

08:58.704 --> 09:02.583
Fortune is smiling upon me like the creepy
guy on the corner of Third and Main.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.460
We're in the royal
jelly chamber

09:04.460 --> 09:07.838
of the Moist Beauty
organic cosmetics factory!

09:07.838 --> 09:09.340
(LAUGHS)

09:09.340 --> 09:11.467
How unbelievably coincidental.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.844
No, really, I mean, I couldn't have
asked for a better place to crash.

09:13.844 --> 09:16.597
Anyway, you have failed,
Pinky the Chihuahua,

09:16.597 --> 09:18.682
and brought me right
to the biggest supply

09:18.682 --> 09:20.976
of royal jelly
in the Tri-State Area!

09:20.976 --> 09:22.811
(LAUGHS)

09:28.484 --> 09:30.486
I can't move.

09:30.486 --> 09:33.822
Well, I, I'm not much larger and I'm
not really feeling royal at all.

09:33.822 --> 09:35.991
I, I suppose my plan
was predicated

09:35.991 --> 09:38.494
on a faulty hypothesis now,
wasn't it?

09:38.494 --> 09:40.454
I guess there's only
one thing to say and that's,

09:40.454 --> 09:41.872
"Curse you,
Pinky the Chihuahua!"

09:47.628 --> 09:49.838
Ooh, how humiliating.

09:49.838 --> 09:52.883
Piloted off to the
pokey by a pooch.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.386
Here's your patch
and here's my patch.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.138
<i>Yaw. Tune to par-tam!</i>

09:58.138 --> 09:59.640
Sorry we're late, Phineas.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.517
Our bee ceremony
ran long.

10:01.517 --> 10:04.520
No worries, Isabella. Go ahead
and join Mom in the fun.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.730
Come on, girls,
let's hit the pool!

10:08.524 --> 10:10.901
Aw, it's just like
old times.

10:10.901 --> 10:12.986
Hey, Isabella.
We're having iced tea.

10:12.986 --> 10:14.780
You want some, honey?

10:14.780 --> 10:17.491
What did you say?
I said we're having iced tea.

10:17.491 --> 10:18.534
You want some honey?

10:18.534 --> 10:23.789
Oh, um, sure!

10:23.789 --> 10:24.998
<i>L' Shake it, shake it,
shake it, shake it</i>

10:24.998 --> 10:26.417
<i>P Shake it, shake it, stop!</i>

10:26.417 --> 10:28.419
<i>I' Figure-eight
and shake it again</i>

10:28.419 --> 10:29.628
<i>I' Shake it, shake it,
shake it, shake it</i>

10:29.628 --> 10:31.171
<i>P Shake it, shake it, stop!</i>

10:31.171 --> 10:33.173
<i>P Everybody, shake your
rear end P You got it!</i>

10:33.173 --> 10:34.425
<i>I' Shake it, shake it,
shake it, shake it</i>

10:34.425 --> 10:35.676
<i>P Shake it, shake it, stop!</i>

10:35.676 --> 10:37.761
<i>P Come on and
swing those skirts</i>

10:37.761 --> 10:38.929
<i>I' Shake it, shake it,
shake it, shake it</i>

10:38.929 --> 10:40.013
<i>P Shake it, shake it, stop!</i>

10:40.013 --> 10:42.433
<i>I' Try to hit it on 13 hertz</i>

10:42.433 --> 10:44.560
<i>J) It's a waggle dance,
waggle dance</i>

10:44.560 --> 10:46.770
<i>I' Show them where
they've got to go</i>

10:46.770 --> 10:49.064
<i>J) It's a waggle dance,
waggle dance</i>

10:49.064 --> 10:51.066
<i>P Toke 'em to the bee chateau</i>

10:51.066 --> 10:52.151
<i>P Waggle dance</i>
