WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:02.803
Narrator: Tonight, Emma Grede,
founder and CEO

00:02.803 --> 00:05.072
of smash-hit apparel brand
Good American

00:05.072 --> 00:06.874
and founding partner of Skims,

00:06.874 --> 00:08.542
returns to the Tank.

00:08.542 --> 00:11.278
It's not quite growing
at the speed

00:11.278 --> 00:12.579
that I think it should.

00:12.579 --> 00:14.047
I see a whole bunch
of problems.

00:14.047 --> 00:15.983
You're selling yourself
out of business.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.084
"This is <i>bad."</i>

00:18.452 --> 00:19.920
I'll do that deal.

00:19.920 --> 00:23.023
I obviously would not want
to go through that pain again.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.926
But I felt like
this is my purpose.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.761
You are badass women.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.763
Who's ready
to bring home the bacon?

00:29.763 --> 00:31.965
- Whoa!
- Ah!

00:31.965 --> 00:34.501
- Oh!
- Oh, my gosh.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.480
Narrator: First in the Tank
is a healthy alternative

00:46.480 --> 00:49.816
to a food that many vegans
miss the most.

00:57.524 --> 00:59.593
Hello, Sharks.
I'm Beth Zotter.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.228
And I'm Amanda Stiles.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.796
We're from
Berkeley, California,

01:02.796 --> 01:06.199
and we're the co-founders of
the Umaro Protein Company.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.869
The plant-based meat category
is exploding,

01:08.869 --> 01:11.438
but everyone's using
the same proteins.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.307
It's time for a sea change,

01:13.307 --> 01:16.843
and we're building something
that can change everything.

01:16.843 --> 01:21.014
This is Umaro,
seaweed that's been transformed

01:21.014 --> 01:23.250
from plant to protein.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.986
Wow.
Seaweed is surprisingly
high in protein,

01:25.986 --> 01:29.289
and it's one of
the fastest-growing
plants on Earth.

01:29.289 --> 01:32.359
Seaweed requires no land,
no fresh water,

01:32.359 --> 01:34.127
and no fertilizer to grow.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.296
It's a superfood
for the planet.

01:36.296 --> 01:38.799
We are pioneers
at the forefront

01:38.799 --> 01:41.301
of a new frontier
in protein.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.070
We're developing
advanced systems

01:43.070 --> 01:44.871
in high-tech ocean farming

01:44.871 --> 01:46.907
and precision
protein extraction

01:46.907 --> 01:50.544
that will unlock the ocean
as our future source of protein.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.212
It's massive,

01:52.212 --> 01:54.948
but none of that really matters
unless it tastes good.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.049
Yeah.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.418
So we're using it
to create

01:58.418 --> 02:01.054
America's favorite food.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.190
It's the holy grail
of plant-based meat --

02:03.190 --> 02:06.026
sizzley, salty, delicious...

02:06.026 --> 02:07.060
Yeah!

02:07.060 --> 02:08.595
- ...bacon.
- I <i>love</i> bacon.

02:08.595 --> 02:12.232
Umaro Superfood Bacon
is the first plant-based bacon

02:12.232 --> 02:14.468
your dad is gonna like.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.403
There's two kinds of
bacon lovers in this world --

02:16.403 --> 02:17.738
the ones who like it crispy

02:17.738 --> 02:19.740
and the ones
who like it soft and chewy.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.875
Either way you like it,
we've made bacon

02:21.875 --> 02:25.545
that's just like the real thing
and will blow your mind.

02:25.545 --> 02:26.647
Huh.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.650
Bacon is huge,
but it's just the beginning.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.451
We're asking
for $500,000

02:31.451 --> 02:33.120
in exchange for
a 2% equity stake...

02:33.120 --> 02:36.256
Oh, I knew it. Wow!
...in the future
of protein.

02:36.256 --> 02:37.891
Hello.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.127
Who's ready
to bring home the bacon?

02:40.127 --> 02:42.396
- Got to try it.
- This better taste good.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.730
So what you have
in front of you

02:43.730 --> 02:46.967
is a classic
American sandwich -- BLT.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.836
BLT is made
with extra-crispy bacon.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.772
But for those of you
who like it soft and chewy,

02:51.772 --> 02:53.540
our bacon is pre-cooked.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.108
On your left,
you have the bacon...

02:55.108 --> 02:57.310
Ugh.
...right out
of the package.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.413
And in the middle
is just right.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.581
The crispy's okay.
The chewy, not so much.

03:01.581 --> 03:03.316
Oh, it's not --
which one's this?

03:03.316 --> 03:05.552
The chewy one
that's right out of the box.

03:05.552 --> 03:07.721
I --
Most people are gonna
like the crispy bacon,
which is in the middle.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.556
I love bacon.
Don't love this.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.892
Crispy's good.
It doesn't <i>really</i>
taste like bacon.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.628
No, the crispy one does.
I mean, it's salted, right?

03:14.628 --> 03:15.662
It's got that cured taste.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.831
Grede: Just try it
in a sandwich.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.434
It's great in a sandwich.
Like, really good.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.069
I think in your sandwich,
it's pretty nice.

03:22.069 --> 03:25.172
So, you're 87 calories
for two strips.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.007
So compared to real bacon,

03:27.007 --> 03:28.709
how many calories
in a strip of real bacon?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.410
It's very similar.
So we have a --

03:30.410 --> 03:31.878
we have a similar
amount of fat,

03:31.878 --> 03:34.514
a little bit lower protein,
but what we're going for here

03:34.514 --> 03:37.784
is to get the -- the juicy,
fatty texture of bacon.

03:37.784 --> 03:39.453
What's your background?
Where did you get, like --

03:39.453 --> 03:40.854
<i>how</i> did you
come up with it?

03:40.854 --> 03:42.355
So, first of all,
let me tell you,

03:42.355 --> 03:45.959
my mission is to protect this
amazing planet that we live on.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.361
My background
is in renewable energy,

03:48.361 --> 03:50.097
and a few years ago,
I received

03:50.097 --> 03:52.999
a $5 million research grant
from the Department of Energy

03:52.999 --> 03:56.737
to build and engineer
offshore seaweed farms for fuel.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.271
I knew that animal protein

03:58.271 --> 04:00.507
was a huge contributor
to global warming,

04:00.507 --> 04:04.311
and I realized that seaweed
had an immense potential

04:04.311 --> 04:07.314
to be a planet-friendly
source of protein.

04:07.314 --> 04:09.149
And how did you two
find each other?

04:09.149 --> 04:10.817
We're actually from
the same county in Virginia,

04:10.817 --> 04:12.886
but we didn't meet
until we were in Berkeley,

04:12.886 --> 04:15.822
and I went looking for someone
who was an expert in protein.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.390
First off, my mission

04:17.390 --> 04:20.260
is to reduce
the factory farming of animals.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.395
And I think the best way
to do that is by making

04:22.395 --> 04:24.598
plant-based foods
that are so delicious

04:24.598 --> 04:27.267
people would rather eat them
than the animals.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.804
So I earned a PhD
in plant biochemistry

04:30.804 --> 04:32.038
to give me the expertise

04:32.038 --> 04:33.840
to make top-of-the-line
plant-based food.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.675
Cuban: How many other
competitors do you have?

04:35.675 --> 04:37.811
We're the first
and only company

04:37.811 --> 04:39.980
to commercialize
seaweed protein,

04:39.980 --> 04:42.115
and we have foundational
intellectual property

04:42.115 --> 04:44.351
across the value chain.
We have patent applications

04:44.351 --> 04:46.720
on the protein-separation
process.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.188
We have patent applications

04:48.188 --> 04:50.390
on using our protein
in plant-based meats,

04:50.390 --> 04:52.192
and we have
a patent application

04:52.192 --> 04:54.194
on the fat mimetic
that we've made.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.563
So you're not selling
this product yet.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.331
This is a prototype.
It's a prototype.

04:58.331 --> 04:59.266
What you have
in front of you is

04:59.266 --> 05:01.101
the first 500 slices
ever made.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.737
What does this cost to make,
and what do you sell it for?

05:03.737 --> 05:06.406
Right. So we'll be launching
in food service.

05:06.406 --> 05:09.242
Food service will pay
$18 a pound.

05:09.242 --> 05:12.779
For comparison, food service
currently pays about $15 a pound

05:12.779 --> 05:15.382
for real pre-cooked bacon.

05:15.382 --> 05:18.285
Okay.
We'll get --
we'll get $12.60

05:18.285 --> 05:19.553
from the distributor.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.722
And right now, our cost of goods
is about $7.30.

05:22.722 --> 05:25.592
We'll bring that down
to $5.20.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.727
Other people are gonna
have access to seaweed, right?

05:27.727 --> 05:29.830
Right.
And there's others
that are working on

05:29.830 --> 05:32.232
an alternative process
that is similar to yours.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.801
You just think your efficiency
of the protein is better?

05:34.801 --> 05:38.004
Our patent applications
cover the use of seaweed protein

05:38.004 --> 05:39.105
in plant-based meat.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.607
You said bacon
was just the beginning.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.842
So what else
are you planning?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.610
So we're really excited
to keep moving

05:43.610 --> 05:47.647
in the breakfast-meat category
and also in other cured meats.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.549
I'm really excited
to make pepperoni --

05:49.549 --> 05:52.052
So you want to reinvent the
wheel and make it from scratch.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.521
You want to make a sausage.
You want to make patties.
Cuban: They want to
replace the industry.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.722
You want to do
all that stuff.

05:55.722 --> 05:58.425
We're gonna be one of the giants
in this industry

05:58.425 --> 06:01.228
in the next decade.
Herjavec: Can I ask --
Where you're losing me

06:01.228 --> 06:03.530
is you're saying
the business today

06:03.530 --> 06:05.966
is worth $25 million,

06:05.966 --> 06:08.134
and you're not
capturing for me

06:08.134 --> 06:10.070
how you're gonna
get that market.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.839
If I'm a consumer
and I walk into a store

06:12.839 --> 06:16.376
and I see a soy-based product
and I see your product,

06:16.376 --> 06:18.578
why would I pick up
your product?

06:18.578 --> 06:22.282
No one is gonna make anything
close to as good

06:22.282 --> 06:24.618
as our bacon --
So it's qualitative.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.920
Because it tastes better.
You'll buy --
ours tastes like bacon.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.356
I don't know if it tastes
just like bacon, though.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.124
It's a prototype.
We're gonna keep improving it.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.727
This is our first batch.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.128
But with our first batch,

06:35.128 --> 06:36.830
we've already gotten
a purchase order.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.766
We're in conversations with two
additional restaurant chains.

06:39.766 --> 06:43.169
I can't cross the bridge
to the $25 million

06:43.169 --> 06:48.141
for a 2% investment based on
"our bacon tastes better."

06:48.141 --> 06:49.743
I'm out.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.945
We're at the early stages
of a revolution

06:51.945 --> 06:53.380
in plant-based food.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.882
The companies that establish
the leading products

06:55.882 --> 06:57.350
in each category right now

06:57.350 --> 06:59.452
will be giants
in the next decade.

06:59.452 --> 07:01.087
And we will be
one of them.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.989
In order to do this,
you're gonna have to raise

07:02.989 --> 07:04.291
a boatload of money.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.693
We're currently in the middle
of a series "A" fundraise.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.328
- For how much?
- At what valuation?

07:08.328 --> 07:09.796
$25 million.

07:09.796 --> 07:13.667
You two are two of the most
impressive women I've ever seen.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.436
The thing that gets me
is the valuation at this point.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.139
$500,000 for 2%
of your business

07:19.139 --> 07:20.974
just feels
a little punchy.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.910
You are gonna need to raise
a <i>boatload</i> of money,

07:23.910 --> 07:25.345
and so I'm gonna end up
getting diluted

07:25.345 --> 07:26.680
and diluted and diluted down.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.684
So for that reason, I'm out,
but good luck.

07:30.684 --> 07:31.618
Thank you. Thank you.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.852
O'Leary:
I will make you an offer.

07:32.852 --> 07:34.487
I'm not agreeing
on your valuation.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.222
I understand this may cause
some heartache

07:36.222 --> 07:38.825
with this "A" round
you're doing.

07:38.825 --> 07:42.295
But I also bring a lot of value
in who I am and what I can do.

07:42.295 --> 07:46.599
I'll do this deal
for the 500K.

07:46.599 --> 07:49.336
I'd like...8%.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.671
Alright, thank you.
I'd like to hear --
Herjavec: Wow.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.273
How much are you raising
in this round?

07:53.273 --> 07:54.607
We're raising $10 million.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.743
O'Leary: Do you have
any flexibility on the equity?

07:56.743 --> 07:59.412
You willing to give up more
for the $500,000?

07:59.412 --> 08:01.848
More equity for $500,000?
Yeah.

08:01.848 --> 08:05.318
Would you consider
his 8%?

08:05.318 --> 08:08.822
We'd do 8%
for $1 million.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.691
I'll do that deal.

08:11.691 --> 08:13.693
Greiner:
Listen, ladies...
I'll do that deal
with you guys.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.096
Wait, listen, listen, listen.
Look at me.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.974
Narrator:
Two Sharks are out.

08:27.974 --> 08:30.377
Amanda and Beth have
two offers on the table

08:30.377 --> 08:33.613
for their seaweed-based
bacon company, Umaro.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.749
But Lori also seems interested.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.917
We'd do 8%
for $1 million.

08:37.917 --> 08:40.954
I'll do that deal.

08:40.954 --> 08:43.123
Greiner:
Listen, ladies...
I'll do that deal
with you guys.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.526
Wait, listen, listen, listen.
Look at me.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.729
You are badass women.
I <i>love</i> badass women.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.264
You blow me away.
You're so impressive.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.233
I want to be
on this journey with you

08:53.233 --> 08:55.201
really, really, really badly.

08:55.201 --> 08:59.639
I would like $500,000
for the 4%,

08:59.639 --> 09:02.208
but I want to be non-dilutive
through the next round.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.113
Cuban: So, guys, my offer
still is there

09:07.113 --> 09:11.217
at 100 -- $1 million, rather,
for 8%.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.754
And obviously, I have the
history in plant-based foods

09:14.754 --> 09:16.289
and already have companies

09:16.289 --> 09:18.591
that I can connect you with
that are my companies.

09:18.591 --> 09:19.893
I would love to have
both of you. No.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.361
Would you consider
going together?
No.

09:21.361 --> 09:24.064
Well, I will tell you this --
I have some major corporations

09:24.064 --> 09:27.600
behind me
that want to help me

09:27.600 --> 09:31.271
with women in tech
and women just like yourselves.

09:31.271 --> 09:34.174
And they are <i>big</i> presence
out there.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.508
Everybody's got --
Look, that's...

09:35.508 --> 09:37.310
So listen,
we all have something,

09:37.310 --> 09:39.179
but you just have to see,

09:39.179 --> 09:41.648
who do you want along with you
for the journey?

09:41.648 --> 09:44.217
Exactly right.
I'm gonna be in it
with my heart and soul,

09:44.217 --> 09:47.654
in it to win it,
three badass women.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.757
What do you
want to -- we can whisper.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.659
What do you want to do?

09:52.659 --> 09:55.228
I think we can't let...

09:55.228 --> 09:58.064
Mark,
would you go to 7%?

09:58.064 --> 09:59.299
Yeah.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.667
Cuban, you have a deal.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.635
We'll take it.

10:02.635 --> 10:03.837
Appreciate it. Thank you. Alright.

10:03.837 --> 10:04.838
Greiner: Bummer.

10:04.838 --> 10:05.738
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

10:05.738 --> 10:07.073
Bummer!
Thank you so much.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.976
- Great job. Great job.
- Well done, you two. Congrats.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.244
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.612
Congrats.
Good luck, you guys.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.781
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.683
Stiles: Mark is a leader in
the plant-based space.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.018
He's invested in
a number of other companies.

10:19.018 --> 10:21.554
And so we're really glad
to have him on board.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.389
Seaweed is the most
planet-friendly source

10:23.389 --> 10:26.092
of protein around,
and our bacon is gonna be

10:26.092 --> 10:29.362
the first of many products
to get seaweed onto the plates

10:29.362 --> 10:31.731
of every American
and everyone in the world.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.833
I would have liked to have been
along for the journey,

10:33.833 --> 10:35.768
but you out-moneyed me.

10:35.768 --> 10:38.271
Happens. It happens.
Grede: Damn.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.739
Mark, the richy man.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.913
Narrator:
In season 12, siblings
Shirah and Michael Benarde

10:46.913 --> 10:48.281
made a deal with Lori Greiner

10:48.281 --> 10:51.117
for their drink-spiking
prevention product, NightCap.

10:51.117 --> 10:52.552
Michael: It's a cover
for your drink.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.254
But it's also
a super-cute scrunchie.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.422
Let's see
what they're up to now.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.224
Michael: When me and my sister
pitched to the Sharks,

10:58.224 --> 11:00.894
our company had made
just $68,000 in sales.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.829
Shirah: It's only been a year
since "Shark Tank,"

11:02.829 --> 11:06.566
and we have $2.1 million
in lifetime sales.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.202
Since "Shark Tank," we've added
three brand-new colors

11:09.202 --> 11:10.970
and the NightCap key chain.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.139
Going into the Tank,
Lori was our dream Shark.

11:13.139 --> 11:16.342
She's helped us redo our website
and bring on another investor,

11:16.342 --> 11:18.411
three-time Grammy nominee
Julia Michaels,

11:18.411 --> 11:19.846
who is working with us
to bring NightCap

11:19.846 --> 11:22.682
to music venues and music
festivals around the country.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.885
Drink spiking is so prevalent
around the world,

11:25.885 --> 11:28.087
and social media
gets to everybody.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.789
Greiner:
NightCap was a cause

11:29.789 --> 11:31.624
that was so important
to get behind

11:31.624 --> 11:33.726
and a product that I thought
was so important

11:33.726 --> 11:35.662
for people to know about
and to own.

11:35.662 --> 11:38.965
Listen, we're on a mission,
and the world's going to know.

11:38.965 --> 11:42.035
Our social media presence
has grown tremendously.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.505
We have over 420,000 followers
on TikTok,

11:45.505 --> 11:49.609
with over 175 million views
on our videos.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.344
Michael: We took a deeper look
into our analytics

11:51.344 --> 11:53.479
and noticed that 12%
of our web traffic

11:53.479 --> 11:56.449
was coming from the UK,
despite zero ad spend there.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.318
Unfortunately, we found out
that there's been

11:58.318 --> 12:01.087
a national drink-spiking crisis
going on in the UK,

12:01.087 --> 12:04.390
and we've had tons and tons
of bars, clubs, and universities

12:04.390 --> 12:06.426
reaching out to us
to purchase our product.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.862
We peaked as the number-two
women's accessory on Amazon UK,

12:09.862 --> 12:12.232
doing over $90,000
in one month.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.933
We were also on "Shark Tank,"
by the way.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.068
- You guys were on "Shark Tank"?
- Yeah.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.402
Michael: We're so grateful
to "Shark Tank"

12:16.402 --> 12:18.805
because it's given us
the credibility as entrepreneurs

12:18.805 --> 12:21.107
to be able to spread
this product around the world.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.209
Shirah: When the idea first
came to me in a dream,

12:23.209 --> 12:25.812
I didn't realize how big
the product would become

12:25.812 --> 12:27.880
and how many lives
it would change.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.483
We came into this
with no business experience.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.518
So my message
to young entrepreneurs

12:32.518 --> 12:34.721
would be, dream big
and you can do it, too.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.423
With passion and drive,
anything is possible.

12:45.231 --> 12:47.233
Man: Alright, everybody,
stand by, please.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.369
Here we go.
We're starting the pitch.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.536
Stand by.

12:50.536 --> 12:52.338
Narrator:
Next up is a product

12:52.338 --> 12:55.541
to aid a favorite
childhood activity.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.277
Hi!

12:57.277 --> 12:59.512
- Oh!
- Oh, my gosh.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.248
My name is Conor Lewis
from St. Louis, Missouri,

13:02.248 --> 13:06.719
and I am the founder of FORT.

13:06.719 --> 13:10.623
I am seeking $500,000
for 10% of my company.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.791
Herjavec: Wow.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.259
So, Sharks, my story
goes something like this.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.395
My daughter and I were building
pillow forts in our living room,

13:15.395 --> 13:16.929
and I found myself going,

13:16.929 --> 13:18.998
"Don't take that
beige couch cushion!

13:18.998 --> 13:20.500
That's Mom's favorite blanket.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.735
Not the dining room chairs!"

13:22.735 --> 13:24.771
And spending all that time
cleaning up the mess

13:24.771 --> 13:26.673
after she went to bed,
it hit me --

13:26.673 --> 13:29.075
there's got to be a better way
to do this, right?

13:29.075 --> 13:32.745
And that is where
the idea of FORT came from --

13:32.745 --> 13:37.317
storable, stackable, wipeable,
completely modular system

13:37.317 --> 13:40.086
to build the ultimate
pillow fort.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.287
But get this --

13:41.287 --> 13:45.291
it's all held together
by magnets.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.927
O'Leary: Ooh!

13:47.927 --> 13:52.465
And as I like to say,
"Yay, science!"

13:52.465 --> 13:54.867
So the best part
about building a pillow fort

13:54.867 --> 13:56.502
is this part, which is...

13:56.502 --> 13:58.304
Diving on it.
Right? Is this.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.505
Diving on it, absolutely.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.141
So, Sharks,

14:02.141 --> 14:05.078
who wants to save
the couch cushions of the world

14:05.078 --> 14:07.914
and build the ultimate
pillow fort with me?

14:07.914 --> 14:10.450
Good job.
I think you win the points

14:10.450 --> 14:12.885
for the world's best dad,
that's for sure.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.253
But, like, what is
your background?

14:14.253 --> 14:15.688
How did you come up
with this?

14:15.688 --> 14:19.125
So, I was working in marketing,
and unfortunately,

14:19.125 --> 14:21.928
I lost my job during COVID
in April of last year.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.764
I was wondering, like,
what am I gonna do with my life?

14:24.764 --> 14:27.233
I had always wanted
to be an entrepreneur,

14:27.233 --> 14:29.302
but there was just this,
like, huge fear

14:29.302 --> 14:31.871
that I wouldn't be able
to take care of everybody.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.706
And my wife has
a really good corporate job.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.108
She's a CPA.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.210
And I had just enough money
from severance.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.544
I sold my car.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.580
And I had this idea
for a magnetic pillow fort.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.548
So, Conor, how are you
selling this product?

14:42.548 --> 14:44.584
We're completely focused on
direct-to-consumer.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.419
I ended up taking
a business partner

14:46.419 --> 14:48.121
who owns 5% of the company
right now.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.123
He has put in
all the operational equity. Okay.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.625
He has the opportunity
to buy in up to 40%...

14:52.625 --> 14:54.127
- Up to 40%?
- Wow.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.828
What triggers that?

14:55.828 --> 14:56.863
Revenue targets.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.064
But hold on.
Let me get to the price.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.832
So the price right now currently

14:59.832 --> 15:02.468
is $499 for this full set
right here

15:02.468 --> 15:04.170
you see on the far right.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.138
It comes with 12 pieces...

15:05.138 --> 15:07.106
Grede: $499?

15:07.106 --> 15:09.642
...five cushions -- yes --
and 124 magnets.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.644
$500?!

15:11.644 --> 15:13.413
That's a <i>lot</i> of money.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.915
That was one of the biggest
challenges we had early on --

15:15.915 --> 15:17.216
- Still is.
- You think?

15:17.216 --> 15:18.918
Absolutely, it is.
You're absolutely right.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.121
So we launched on Kickstarter
in January 2021.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.322
My claim to fame is

15:23.322 --> 15:25.224
I sold $2 million of products
in 10 hours.

15:25.224 --> 15:26.092
- Wow!
- Really?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.260
- What?
- Wow.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.828
Lewis: Yeah,
$2 million in 10 hours.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.997
Ended up doing $3.1 million
for the whole campaign.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.699
Grede: Wow.
We've done $4.5 million to date,
year to date.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.468
And it was at that price?
At $499?

15:35.468 --> 15:38.137
No, our average purchase price
was $269.
Wow.

15:38.137 --> 15:39.605
Have you delivered
on the Kickstarter?

15:39.605 --> 15:40.840
We're delivering right now.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.009
I have about 400 units
going out today.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.744
Let me talk about the COGS
for a little bit.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.979
So, when we launched,
like I mentioned,

15:46.979 --> 15:48.714
the average price was --
shipping included --

15:48.714 --> 15:50.616
was around $269.

15:50.616 --> 15:54.287
My original COGS were around
right at $200 landed

15:54.287 --> 15:56.989
and then added
a $50 shipping charge.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.491
The strategy was,
first of all,

15:58.491 --> 16:00.760
I wanted to be able to see if I
could actually sell this, right?

16:00.760 --> 16:03.029
I knew it would be more
expensive than the competitors.

16:03.029 --> 16:05.665
The magnets alone cost
$60 a unit.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.266
Right.
They're hugely expensive.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.335
Why aren't you using Velcro
like everybody else?

16:09.335 --> 16:11.370
Because we ran
a lot of surveys,

16:11.370 --> 16:13.906
and parents unanimously
hate Velcro.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.408
Yeah, hair gets stuck
in it.
Why?

16:15.408 --> 16:18.578
So what we did was we sold at
a loss for the first day and --

16:18.578 --> 16:19.946
At $269?

16:19.946 --> 16:21.781
Yeah, with shipping included,
$269.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.850
I'll tell you what parents
really hate is $500.
Wait, wait, wait, Kevin.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.418
Well, not only
do they hate --
Kevin, let him finish.
Let him finish.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.586
Tell us
your thought process here.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.753
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:27.753 --> 16:28.955
What I realized was that
shipping obviously --

16:28.955 --> 16:30.256
international freight.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.458
Not only that, but of course,
this product is...

16:32.458 --> 16:33.693
It's huge.
...huge to ship.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.761
When I realized how high volume
I was selling --

16:35.761 --> 16:38.931
I ended up selling almost
13,000 units at Kickstarter.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.500
You know, it's unbelievable,
right?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.301
You do like $2 million.
So exciting.

16:42.301 --> 16:43.769
The numbers are rolling
all day, right?

16:43.769 --> 16:46.873
And I let codependency
set the price

16:46.873 --> 16:48.241
and set what
the customer wanted.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.344
After I realized I oversold
the first day, I was like,

16:51.344 --> 16:52.778
"Oh, I have to work
really hard

16:52.778 --> 16:54.447
to sell the rest
of this campaign,"

16:54.447 --> 16:56.182
and I didn't sell enough
to accommodate the cost.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.183
But also, too,
what's important is,

16:57.183 --> 16:58.751
is the people out there

16:58.751 --> 17:00.720
that joined into
your Kickstarter, right?

17:00.720 --> 17:02.321
They were excited
to get the product.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.390
You let them
dictate the price.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.325
But then you had to go back
to the factories.

17:06.325 --> 17:08.528
You had to figure out
the shipping and you had to say,

17:08.528 --> 17:11.898
"Oh, my God,
how do I do this for $269?"

17:11.898 --> 17:13.466
Yeah, we realized
we were in the hole.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.001
We didn't know how big
the hole was,

17:15.001 --> 17:16.903
so we started selling
at a high price point.

17:16.903 --> 17:20.473
We sold $250,000
in another 24 hours, right?

17:20.473 --> 17:23.175
And this was in May,
a few --
At the higher price point?

17:23.175 --> 17:24.710
- What price?
- $499.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.846
So -- So doubling
the price...
And then we doubled the price.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.881
...actually didn't hurt you,
you're saying?

17:28.881 --> 17:31.417
No, we've been able to --
and we've continued selling.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.352
Now we're selling a product
that no one has gotten yet.

17:33.352 --> 17:34.887
We're currently shipping out
our Kickstarter.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.223
I have 17,000 units coming
from overseas right now. Oh.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.525
And no one has received
the product?
17,000.

17:39.525 --> 17:40.626
So it's never
shipped in yet?

17:40.626 --> 17:42.495
Listen, I have a couple
of big concerns here.

17:42.495 --> 17:43.896
Number one is that
you don't know

17:43.896 --> 17:45.131
if this is gonna work,
right?

17:45.131 --> 17:47.333
You've got an enormous amount
of orders sitting there.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.834
Nobody has the product yet.

17:48.834 --> 17:51.070
You don't know what
the customer feedback is... Right.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.172
...if people love it,
what your returns are gonna be. Absolutely.

17:53.172 --> 17:55.241
I mean, that is a huge concern
right now, right?

17:55.241 --> 17:57.209
The good news is
you have their money first.

17:57.209 --> 17:58.945
I do, and so this is where
we get to, like,

17:58.945 --> 18:00.479
the international-freight
challenge.

18:00.479 --> 18:02.882
The last 30 days,
we've had great suppliers.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.817
I have an incredible 3PL
I'm working with

18:04.817 --> 18:06.686
who all have, like,
totally gone to bat for us.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.121
And I've found myself, like,

18:09.121 --> 18:10.756
staring at the numbers
and being like,

18:10.756 --> 18:13.459
"Oh, this is --
this is <i>bad."</i>
It's a thing.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.595
I'm assuming you've burnt
a lot of cash.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.430
Like, yeah. Incredible.
How much?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.599
Basically all of it.
All of it?

18:19.599 --> 18:22.134
You're selling yourself
out of business.

18:22.134 --> 18:23.936
It could be put that way, certainly.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.538
I mean, it's a really tough
situation, right?

18:25.538 --> 18:27.506
It <i>is</i> a tough situation.
And you're so, like, jovial.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.343
Yeah, but this is super hard.
I mean, like, yesterday,

18:30.343 --> 18:32.712
my wife literally, like,
sat on the steps in our house

18:32.712 --> 18:35.114
and cried because, like,
this is hard.
Oh, no!

18:35.114 --> 18:36.882
You all have done this.
Yeah, it's super hard.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.118
You've done this!
You're going to
figure things out.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.087
Like, you're that person
who's not gonna crumble.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.655
You're gonna
figure it out. Yes.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.324
But at least you're being
really honest with us
about what's happened.

18:45.324 --> 18:47.526
I want to understand a little
bit more about your partner.

18:47.526 --> 18:49.595
You mentioned you brought
a partner in for 5%.

18:49.595 --> 18:51.764
And more importantly,
what triggers the 40%?

18:51.764 --> 18:54.033
He will get 40%
if he and his team

18:54.033 --> 18:57.003
are helping us get to
$30 million in revenue.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.237
- Gross revenue.
- In gross?

18:58.237 --> 18:59.305
- Gross sales?
- Yes. Yes.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.307
What is it that
he's technically doing?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.743
So, he has the relationship
with his supplier

19:03.743 --> 19:05.244
that he's done tens of millions
of dollars with.

19:05.244 --> 19:06.612
So he works with
the factory.

19:06.612 --> 19:07.747
- Yep.
- Okay.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.281
He has full marketing team,
ad buyers,

19:09.281 --> 19:12.852
and we both agree that this hole
that I have sunk us into

19:12.852 --> 19:15.588
can be overcome
in the next few months.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.289
O'Leary: Let me take a stab
at this, alright?
Okay.

19:17.289 --> 19:18.991
I see a whole bunch
of problems.

19:18.991 --> 19:19.959
Sure.
I'm sorry.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.093
Yeah.
I mean, first of all,

19:21.093 --> 19:22.628
your cost of goods
are way too high.

19:22.628 --> 19:23.963
I don't understand
why in the world

19:23.963 --> 19:27.099
you'd spend $60 on magnets
when Velcro's just fine.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.735
I don't buy the story that
parents can't deal with Velcro.

19:29.735 --> 19:34.173
Giving away 40%
to somebody for no cash,

19:34.173 --> 19:35.474
which is
your number-one problem,

19:35.474 --> 19:37.243
makes absolutely
no sense to me.

19:37.243 --> 19:40.279
I'm sorry, Conor.
I'm out.

19:40.279 --> 19:41.881
That's fair. Thank you, Kevin.
I appreciate that.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.783
Conor, you're a great case
for what not to do as
an entrepreneur, right?

19:43.783 --> 19:46.652
Sure.
People can learn a lot
from your experience.

19:46.652 --> 19:49.388
And, look,
I think you can survive this.
Uh-huh.

19:49.388 --> 19:52.958
It's not bad that you worked
with somebody else

19:52.958 --> 19:54.827
who didn't provide cash,
right?
Mm-hmm.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.229
Because expertise costs you
one way or another. Sure.

19:57.229 --> 19:58.864
So getting their expertise
is fine.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.668
But the trigger
for their 40%

20:02.668 --> 20:07.373
being set to sales means that
if any one of us invest,

20:07.373 --> 20:08.641
the minute
we close the deal

20:08.641 --> 20:10.810
and we help you
get to $30 million,

20:10.810 --> 20:14.080
we're diluted
by 40% immediately.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.882
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.317
Thanks, Mark.
I appreciate it.

20:18.317 --> 20:20.786
Conor, you know, this is just
not a proven business yet.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.655
You've got all the sales,
but you might have

20:22.655 --> 20:25.624
a 50% return rate,
and we just don't know that yet.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.460
It's just not an investable
opportunity for me.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.162
So I'm out. Yeah.
I appreciate that, Emma.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.598
Yeah, so, I mean, it's obviously
a really challenging situation.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.500
At least
you're honest about it.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.802
You know, I have to be, right?
It's not something I can hide.

20:36.802 --> 20:37.970
Greiner: Well, no,
you have to be --

20:37.970 --> 20:40.206
I mean, you're such
a good person, I can tell.

20:40.206 --> 20:44.543
I would have been in on <i>you</i>
in a heartbeat instantly.
Yeah. I appreciate that.

20:44.543 --> 20:47.213
But now you've -- you've
found someone else, it seems,

20:47.213 --> 20:49.148
that's trying to get you
out of the hole.
Mm-hmm.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.383
So I think you have a partner
in there right now... Yeah.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.919
...that's doing a lot
of the things that I
would have tried to do.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.255
Yeah.
So, unfortunately,
I'm out.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.424
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.959
So there's the story,
you all.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.861
There's still Robert.
There's still Robert?

21:01.861 --> 21:04.130
You know, I think you have
a level of humility... Yeah.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.098
...that really
comes through. Thanks.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.967
And I think people always think
to be a great entrepreneur,

21:07.967 --> 21:10.503
you have to be arrogant,
you have to be full of yourself.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.071
It's the complete opposite.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.939
Lewis: Yeah.
You've got to learn
in life all the time.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.074
We're all learning.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.376
I mean, I love that,
and I love the product.

21:17.376 --> 21:20.079
I just -- like, I'm --

21:20.079 --> 21:23.415
I'm trying to talk myself
into it.

21:23.415 --> 21:24.884
Sure.
I...

21:26.652 --> 21:29.054
It's a tough sell.
It absolutely is.

21:29.054 --> 21:30.890
Conor, don't tell him
what's wrong with it.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.792
There's humility,
but never put yourself down.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.461
Never, ever do that. Okay.

21:35.461 --> 21:38.164
Always believe in yourself,
despite the challenge. Yeah.

21:38.164 --> 21:40.166
Robert, you can solve
his problem with $500,000.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.567
You'd get 10%.
I know.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.969
I-I wish it was less money
'cause I'd love to believe...

21:43.969 --> 21:45.671
Yeah. Yeah.
...and invest in you,

21:45.671 --> 21:48.240
but it's -- can't get there
for $500,000.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.708
Yeah.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.410
I'm sorry.
I'm out.

21:51.410 --> 21:52.878
That's okay.
I appreciate you all.

21:52.878 --> 21:54.346
This has been
an absolute honor.
Cuban: Good luck, Conor.

21:54.346 --> 21:55.681
Oh, good luck, Conor.

21:55.681 --> 21:56.916
And it's been a wonderful
learning experience for me.

21:56.916 --> 21:57.750
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.251
- Good luck.
- Bye.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.522
Lewis:
It's much more overwhelming

22:03.522 --> 22:05.057
than I thought it would be.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.358
I think they saw me.

22:06.358 --> 22:08.060
They saw --
they respected what I did,

22:08.060 --> 22:11.230
and they saw the very real
issues that I kind of created.

22:11.230 --> 22:14.433
And so I-I think I'm okay
with that, you know?

22:26.378 --> 22:28.080
Narrator:
Next in the Tank is a company

22:28.080 --> 22:30.850
that caters to
an underserved market.

22:38.457 --> 22:39.758
Hi, Sharks.

22:39.758 --> 22:42.428
My name is Erica.
I'm from Iowa City, Iowa.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.597
And I'm here seeking $100,000

22:44.597 --> 22:47.833
for 6% in my company,
No Limbits.

22:47.833 --> 22:50.769
Sharks, did you know there are
14 million people

22:50.769 --> 22:52.671
who struggle with
daily living activities,

22:52.671 --> 22:55.507
such as dressing themselves,
due to a disability?

22:55.507 --> 22:57.543
But there just aren't
that many options out there.

22:57.543 --> 23:00.679
So I created No Limbits,
an adaptive clothing brand

23:00.679 --> 23:02.648
with the mission
of increasing comfort,

23:02.648 --> 23:04.884
confidence, and independence

23:04.884 --> 23:07.486
in those who struggle with
clothing due to a disability.

23:07.486 --> 23:09.722
We started with pants
for amputees.

23:11.323 --> 23:12.892
They feature
hidden zippers...

23:12.892 --> 23:14.059
Oh, wow. Wow.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.628
...to make it easier
to dress and undress,

23:15.628 --> 23:18.264
as well as make prosthetic
adjustments throughout the day.

23:18.264 --> 23:20.099
We put in reinforced patches

23:20.099 --> 23:22.268
to stand up
to the carbon-fiber parts

23:22.268 --> 23:24.403
and mechanical knees
from prosthetics.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.338
And we specially shaped them
to fit around

23:26.338 --> 23:28.607
the extra bulk
of a prosthetic socket.

23:30.809 --> 23:32.177
That's right, Sharks --

23:32.177 --> 23:34.813
I <i>don't</i> put my pants on
just like everybody else.

23:34.813 --> 23:37.850
I was in an accident in 2018
and lost my leg.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.953
Suddenly, I wasn't able to wear
what everyone else was wearing.

23:40.953 --> 23:44.023
My prosthetic was bulky,
tearing holes in my clothes,

23:44.023 --> 23:46.358
and I had to completely undress
anytime I needed

23:46.358 --> 23:48.394
to make
a prosthetic adjustment.

23:48.394 --> 23:49.762
And I wasn't alone.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.164
As we were building,
people with a variety

23:52.164 --> 23:54.233
of physical challenges
were reaching out to us,

23:54.233 --> 23:57.202
so we decided to add sensory
and wheelchair product lines

23:57.202 --> 23:58.470
to our collection.

23:58.470 --> 24:01.640
So, Sharks, are you ready
to help everyone live life

24:01.640 --> 24:03.142
with no limits?

24:03.142 --> 24:04.209
Greiner: Mm. Good job. Wow.

24:04.209 --> 24:05.711
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

24:05.711 --> 24:08.047
You took a negative and you
turned it into such a positive.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.715
So, tell us about
what's up here.

24:09.715 --> 24:11.517
So we have our pants
for amputees,

24:11.517 --> 24:13.319
which are denim right now.

24:13.319 --> 24:14.954
There are some sneak peeks
of joggers.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.221
Oh, they're denim?
Yes.

24:16.221 --> 24:18.357
Oh, how exciting!
Just for you, Emma.

24:18.357 --> 24:19.525
O'Leary: Wow.

24:19.525 --> 24:21.860
She got pretty excited
about denim.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.395
You said
the magic word.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.030
Emma, you actually have
a sample

24:25.030 --> 24:26.932
of our wheelchair pants.

24:26.932 --> 24:29.902
So what those are -- we have
a seamless back with no pockets.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.270
They have zippers on the side

24:31.270 --> 24:33.439
so it's easier to dress
while laying down,

24:33.439 --> 24:34.974
and they have
the reinforced patches.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.542
You'll notice the zipper --
it starts on the ankle.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.077
What -- What are
the reinforced patches?

24:38.077 --> 24:40.212
So most prosthetics
are made out of carbon fiber. Right.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.281
The socket sits
right at the knee.
Got it.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.149
So when people
are walking around,

24:44.149 --> 24:45.884
it wears holes in their pants
really quick.

24:45.884 --> 24:47.353
Got it.
Holes that we don't want.

24:47.353 --> 24:48.721
Exactly, exactly. Right.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.222
No, the distressing kind.
I've got it.

24:50.222 --> 24:54.293
Yeah. Also, you have a sample
of our sensory collection.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.895
We developed a special material
that's non-aggravating

24:56.895 --> 24:58.731
to those with
sensory-processing disorder.

24:58.731 --> 25:01.800
It's knit, non-irritating.
It has a cool-touch feel.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.602
And where you manufacturing
right now?

25:03.602 --> 25:04.770
Bangladesh.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.972
Erica, how big is
this market?

25:06.972 --> 25:10.009
Like, can you build
a sustainable business

25:10.009 --> 25:11.744
at scale for this?

25:11.744 --> 25:12.778
Absolutely.

25:12.778 --> 25:14.613
The U. S. total
addressable market

25:14.613 --> 25:17.149
is $2.6 billion.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.784
You know,
it's -- it's a huge market.

25:18.784 --> 25:20.152
I've done a little bit
of work in this.

25:20.152 --> 25:21.854
So, earlier this year,

25:21.854 --> 25:24.823
Skims were Team USA's
Olympic sponsor.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.693
And we also sponsored
the Paralympics...

25:27.693 --> 25:29.395
Huh.
...which is actually
my favorite part of the Games.

25:29.395 --> 25:32.631
So we've actually looked
quite a lot into accessibility,

25:32.631 --> 25:34.833
specifically for underwear
and shapewear.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.001
So what I really want
to understand

25:36.001 --> 25:37.436
is more about
the technical aspect

25:37.436 --> 25:39.938
of what you're doing differently
and what sets you apart,

25:39.938 --> 25:42.107
'cause there's a ton
of competition, right?

25:42.107 --> 25:45.210
Actually, not a lot
in the adaptive space.
Not that much? Really?

25:45.210 --> 25:48.347
And it is easier to obtain IP
on adaptive clothing

25:48.347 --> 25:49.782
because it serves
a functional purpose.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.450
So we're drafting a patent
right now

25:51.450 --> 25:53.986
for the zipper
on the inseam of the pant

25:53.986 --> 25:55.554
all the way,
halfway up the thigh.
I love it.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.856
But lots of jeans
have zippers.

25:57.856 --> 25:59.925
Like, what's different
about your zipper?

25:59.925 --> 26:01.360
The construction
that it's hidden.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.828
Just because it's adaptive
doesn't mean

26:02.828 --> 26:04.530
it has to <i>look</i> adaptive.
Got it.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.198
And do you think you will
get that patent?

26:06.198 --> 26:07.533
Yes, our patent attorney

26:07.533 --> 26:09.468
was a former patent attorney
for Nike.

26:09.468 --> 26:10.869
And what do
the jeans cost?

26:10.869 --> 26:13.972
Yeah, so we have an $18
cost of goods sold,

26:13.972 --> 26:16.341
landed in our distribution
center in St. Louis.

26:16.341 --> 26:17.676
We sell them for $70 and --

26:17.676 --> 26:19.445
- $70.
- Wow. That's a great margin.

26:19.445 --> 26:21.180
Emma, what's that
as a price point for a jean?

26:21.180 --> 26:23.348
Oh, that's very good.
Is it?

26:23.348 --> 26:24.583
It's, yeah,
middle of the market.
It's cheap.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.618
It's not like --
it's certainly not premium.

26:26.618 --> 26:28.987
It's perfect.
How are you reaching
your customer?

26:28.987 --> 26:30.355
How do they know
you're out there?

26:30.355 --> 26:33.058
So, right now, we have
a $14 customer acquisition cost

26:33.058 --> 26:34.226
on Facebook.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.928
Our digital ad spend
is doing really well

26:35.928 --> 26:37.996
because people share it
and tag people

26:37.996 --> 26:39.498
that they know
who could use it.

26:39.498 --> 26:41.967
But, actually, the method I'm
really excited about to launch

26:41.967 --> 26:45.104
is tapping into
healthcare systems, clinics,

26:45.104 --> 26:46.705
people who are interfacing

26:46.705 --> 26:48.340
with these people all day
and every day.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.542
Over 80% of people
who struggle with clothing

26:50.542 --> 26:51.777
due to a disability,

26:51.777 --> 26:53.178
the first or second person
they ask

26:53.178 --> 26:54.880
is actually
their healthcare provider.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.081
That's a great idea.

26:56.081 --> 26:57.950
Tell me a little bit more
about you, though.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.986
Yeah, so I was studying
during my accident.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.222
I was on a internship
in Colorado,

27:03.222 --> 27:04.756
and I got my dream job offer,

27:04.756 --> 27:07.459
which was to be
a plutonium chemist

27:07.459 --> 27:09.361
at Los Alamos National Lab.
Oh, wow.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.162
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.296
- That's crazy.
- Wow.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.065
What made you want
to be a plutonium chemist?

27:13.065 --> 27:15.033
I just fell in love with it.

27:15.033 --> 27:18.604
It was cool because it had
applications on the Mars rover.

27:18.604 --> 27:20.973
I loved the idea
of discovering something new.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.708
And then when I was
in my accident,

27:22.708 --> 27:25.210
I was no longer able
to work in the lab

27:25.210 --> 27:27.079
because it was --
it was dangerous.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.348
I was on crutches
for a really long time.

27:29.348 --> 27:32.317
And so I started
altering clothes,

27:32.317 --> 27:34.453
and then it just snowballed.

27:34.453 --> 27:36.688
That's great.
I mean,
apart from the obvious,

27:36.688 --> 27:39.057
how has the accident
really changed your life?

27:39.057 --> 27:40.993
I mean, it opened my eyes
to things

27:40.993 --> 27:44.530
that I never would have
experienced before.

27:45.931 --> 27:48.967
I obviously would not want
to go through that pain again.

27:48.967 --> 27:51.570
But I felt like
this is my purpose.

27:51.570 --> 27:52.971
Yeah, it's your calling.

27:52.971 --> 27:55.140
And if I can make
this mean something,

27:55.140 --> 27:57.976
then it was something that
happened to me for a reason.

27:57.976 --> 28:00.779
I think the hallmark of our
business is that we talk about

28:00.779 --> 28:04.316
never having to sacrifice style
for the sake of inclusivity.

28:04.316 --> 28:07.152
So if you are
in the plus-size spectrum

28:07.152 --> 28:09.121
or if you're a shorter woman
or a taller woman,

28:09.121 --> 28:11.356
you don't want to
have to make sacrifices.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.292
And so I think
more optionality

28:13.292 --> 28:15.127
everywhere in the market
is needed,

28:15.127 --> 28:16.128
and that's what
I'm talking about

28:16.128 --> 28:18.096
in this accessibility market.

28:18.096 --> 28:21.333
It's <i>huge.</i>
So for me, this is incredible.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.901
But back to the sales.
Give us the numbers.

28:22.901 --> 28:24.369
What are you selling
at the moment?

28:24.369 --> 28:27.539
Yeah, so I did $26,000
on my sewing machine.

28:27.539 --> 28:31.877
And then I pre-sold $41,000
in the pants for amputees,

28:31.877 --> 28:34.513
and that's the only thing
that we've put to market so far.

28:34.513 --> 28:37.849
And is that pre-sold
to individuals online or to --

28:37.849 --> 28:39.351
Half was to individuals,

28:39.351 --> 28:40.686
and then half was
our purchase order

28:40.686 --> 28:43.522
on the behalf of the VA...
Ah!

28:43.522 --> 28:46.225
...for 500 units
as a phase one...
So you may be able to --

28:46.225 --> 28:48.460
...with a letter of intent
for a phase two

28:48.460 --> 28:50.796
for $100,000
in the state of Minnesota

28:50.796 --> 28:52.064
and to scale nationally.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.865
- Oh, congratulations.
- My goodness.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.234
How did you
get into the VA?

28:55.234 --> 28:56.568
They reached out to us.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.536
They reached out to you?

28:57.536 --> 28:58.804
- That's fabulous.
- Yes.

28:58.804 --> 29:01.707
Erica, you are <i>exactly</i>
the type of person

29:01.707 --> 29:02.941
that like to invest in.

29:02.941 --> 29:05.844
You've got the product.
You've figured it out.

29:05.844 --> 29:09.081
You've got purchase orders.
This is an absolute no-brainer.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.282
Mark, do you want to
come in on this?

29:10.282 --> 29:11.283
Yeah, I'd love to come in.
Let's do it together.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.085
Yeah. Okay. Absolutely.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.621
I am very happy with
the 100K.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.956
You asked for 100K
for 6%?

29:20.425 --> 29:22.227
12%?

29:22.227 --> 29:24.563
Can you make 12%?

29:24.563 --> 29:27.099
And you get Mark <i>and</i> me?

29:28.233 --> 29:30.869
Would you do 100K for 10%?

29:32.971 --> 29:35.607
I like that she's negotiating.
Give her the 10%.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.709
Yes, you got a deal.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.144
- Deal!
- Good job.

29:39.144 --> 29:40.946
- Whoo!
- Was it too quick?

29:42.414 --> 29:44.249
That was unexp--
That was per--

29:44.249 --> 29:46.785
That was perfect.
Thank you.

29:46.785 --> 29:47.953
Oh, no, thank you.

29:47.953 --> 29:50.722
You're such a sweetheart.
Don't cry. Don't cry.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.057
Well done.
You nailed it.

29:52.057 --> 29:53.558
- Well done. Amazing.
- Your product's amazing.

29:53.558 --> 29:54.793
You're gonna do
a great job.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.162
Thank you so much.
Good job, Erica.

29:57.162 --> 29:58.797
You're gonna kill it.
Thank you.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.065
Thank you so much.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.700
So cute!

30:03.035 --> 30:04.036
Cole:
It's just been

30:04.036 --> 30:05.737
a really hard road to get here,

30:05.737 --> 30:08.640
and now I feel like
everything's gonna be okay.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.744
There are very few moments
that you can point to and say,

30:12.744 --> 30:14.046
"My life changed then,"

30:14.046 --> 30:18.150
but, like, this is absolutely
going to be one of them.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.686
I mean, you talk about

30:20.686 --> 30:22.888
capitalism to have impact,
right?
Yeah, that's it.

30:22.888 --> 30:25.123
You know, just doing it
for the right reason.

30:25.123 --> 30:28.427
Emma, you could not be a more
perfect partner for her.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.829
Oh, my. We're gonna make
really cute jeans. Yes.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.497
Perfect partner. Done.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.577
Narrator:
Next up is a product inspired by

30:45.577 --> 30:48.046
some of the world's
strongest athletes.

30:52.951 --> 30:54.519
Ready?

30:55.854 --> 30:57.656
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Kaycee from Florida.

30:57.656 --> 31:00.092
And I'm Kaycee's best friend,
Bri, from Michigan.

31:00.092 --> 31:03.929
We're seeking $300,000
for 15% of our business,

31:03.929 --> 31:05.297
Apolla Performance.

31:05.297 --> 31:09.067
Sharks, did you know
75% of Americans

31:09.067 --> 31:11.069
say that they experience
foot pain?

31:11.069 --> 31:13.739
But <i>we...</i>
have the answer.

31:13.739 --> 31:16.908
Introducing the smartest sock
in the world,

31:16.908 --> 31:18.243
Apolla!

31:18.243 --> 31:19.578
Herjavec: Ta-da!

31:19.578 --> 31:22.147
Using targeted compression
and sustainable yarns,

31:22.147 --> 31:25.317
we have found
the Goldilocks zone for support.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.620
Apolla socks have arch support,
ankle stability,

31:28.620 --> 31:31.590
energy absorption,
and the option of grip.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.291
They're as durable
as they are cozy,

31:33.291 --> 31:35.827
and they feel like hugs
on your feet.

31:35.827 --> 31:38.430
But this is not your average
compression sock,

31:38.430 --> 31:41.700
and our highly engineered design
is life-changing.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.503
Apolla socks help reduce
pain, fatigue, swelling,

31:44.503 --> 31:45.804
allowing you
to build strength

31:45.804 --> 31:47.539
without restricting
range of motion.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.641
Sharks, we are
an all-female-owned,

31:49.641 --> 31:51.443
- made-in-the-
- USA premium brand

31:51.443 --> 31:53.912
that has built a community
of health and wellness.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.782
So who wants to help empower
those that need a hand...

31:56.782 --> 31:57.783
...or a foot...

31:57.783 --> 31:59.918
...to do more
of what they love

31:59.918 --> 32:04.189
one step at a time
with Apolla socks?

32:04.189 --> 32:05.257
- Good job.
- Amazing.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.625
Nice theater.
Good for you.

32:06.625 --> 32:07.592
One moment
before we dive through.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.827
So what's in front
of you --

32:08.827 --> 32:11.296
you have a sampling
of all six of our styles

32:11.296 --> 32:13.165
in various colors and tones.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.499
Now, the best way
to do it...
Ooh!

32:14.499 --> 32:16.868
...if you've never done a
high-compression sock before...

32:16.868 --> 32:18.136
Wow!
...you fold it in half,

32:18.136 --> 32:20.105
get your thumbs
all the way into that toe,

32:20.105 --> 32:22.274
and scrunch it up
nice and tight.
I love it.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.009
Then you have to pull it on
nice and strong,

32:24.009 --> 32:26.011
completely covering
the ball of the foot,

32:26.011 --> 32:27.979
then peel it on
to the rest of the foot,

32:27.979 --> 32:29.314
then repeat
on the other side.

32:29.314 --> 32:32.350
Now -- Robert!
What you are feeling with...

32:32.350 --> 32:34.219
- Slow down!
- Gentle, Robert.

32:34.219 --> 32:35.287
Good job, Peter Pan.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.221
Jones: ...you're gonna first
be noticing

32:36.221 --> 32:37.789
our patented
arch and ankle support.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.124
- So, Robert?
- I love it!

32:39.124 --> 32:40.525
Yes, patented!
Yes!

32:40.525 --> 32:42.027
It's incredible.

32:42.027 --> 32:43.995
They really are, and that's
our first "wow" moment,

32:43.995 --> 32:45.931
when people
get them on their feet.

32:45.931 --> 32:47.532
- Lori?
- They feel good.

32:47.532 --> 32:49.100
Next, you're gonna be noticing
he energy-absorption pads

32:49.100 --> 32:51.036
that are knit in on the ball
of the foot and the heel.

32:51.036 --> 32:53.205
Those have three
independent studies...
Jump up!

32:53.205 --> 32:56.541
...showing their efficacy
of reducing force.

32:56.541 --> 32:59.511
And, finally, you will feel that
it's like a hug on your foot,

32:59.511 --> 33:01.112
and what that hug is doing

33:01.112 --> 33:04.082
is reducing the injury-inducing
inflammation

33:04.082 --> 33:06.418
that causes pain,
swelling, and fatigue.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.086
I feel the hug. Good.

33:08.086 --> 33:10.422
What's the material?
Nylon and polyester.

33:10.422 --> 33:11.923
And how did you come up
with the design?

33:11.923 --> 33:13.792
How do you know about
all this compression

33:13.792 --> 33:14.893
and, like, what it does?

33:14.893 --> 33:15.794
Well...
Yeah.

33:15.794 --> 33:17.028
...let me tell you.

33:17.028 --> 33:19.130
Apolla actually started
to help

33:19.130 --> 33:21.333
the toughest athlete
in the world.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.501
Not hockey.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.469
No, Mark, sorry,
it's not basketball players.

33:24.469 --> 33:25.303
Is it mums?

33:25.303 --> 33:26.471
- It is dancers!
- Dancers!

33:26.471 --> 33:28.740
- Oh, duh.
- Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.141
Now, dancers have
twice the injury rate

33:30.141 --> 33:32.177
from the knee down
as football players.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.713
And I came up with the idea
in grad school

33:34.713 --> 33:39.651
to use high-targeted compression
to create flexible support

33:39.651 --> 33:43.088
that would mitigate what causes
65% of dancer injury.

33:43.088 --> 33:44.489
Are you a dancer?
And that's inflammation.

33:44.489 --> 33:46.091
We're lifelong dancers.
Well, let me tell you!

33:46.091 --> 33:48.293
Tell me! Tell me!

33:48.293 --> 33:51.196
So, I actually have
my master's in kinesiology,

33:51.196 --> 33:54.199
as well as in grad school
I got my certification... Ahh.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.500
...as a registered
yoga teacher,

33:55.500 --> 33:56.968
as well
as national certified

33:56.968 --> 33:58.670
strength and conditioning specialist

33:58.670 --> 34:00.205
and personal trainer.
Wow. Wow.

34:00.205 --> 34:03.842
Dance life gives you
creativity, grit, discipline.

34:03.842 --> 34:07.612
But it's also a culture
that is riddled with injuries

34:07.612 --> 34:09.080
to mind,
bodies, and souls.
Mm-hmm.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.550
And I was one of those
that suffered

34:11.550 --> 34:14.486
and still cope with many
of my chronic injuries today.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.688
Brianne, what -- what is
<i>your</i> background?
Greiner: Yes.

34:16.688 --> 34:19.925
Yeah. So, like Kaycee,
I'm a lifelong dancer.

34:19.925 --> 34:21.893
I have taught.
I've competed.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.795
I have danced in L. A. professionally.

34:23.795 --> 34:26.498
So, I danced for years --
modern jazz and ballet.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.633
And you know what
it did to me?

34:28.633 --> 34:30.969
It made my large toe
bone-on-bone...

34:30.969 --> 34:33.705
Yes.
- ...from being en pointe
and all of that.

34:33.705 --> 34:36.575
So I wound up having to have
surgery on both big toes.

34:36.575 --> 34:37.709
Painful.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.110
So, yeah, I <i>totally</i> know.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.346
I am the walking wounded
from years of dance.

34:41.346 --> 34:42.547
Yeah.
Wow.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.015
And I want to speak
to what these feel like

34:44.015 --> 34:45.850
because I'm the skeptic. Sure.

34:45.850 --> 34:49.087
I've bought everything and every
type of shoe and all of that.
I know.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.756
They feel really good
because what's cool about them

34:51.756 --> 34:53.925
is they're padded right here,

34:53.925 --> 34:56.661
which, especially, I know
for women with high heels

34:56.661 --> 34:57.929
and things like that,

34:57.929 --> 35:00.665
you're just -- you're sore
in the pad of your foot.

35:00.665 --> 35:03.134
But then here,
it compresses tighter,

35:03.134 --> 35:05.203
so you're giving
a built-in arch, right?

35:05.203 --> 35:07.505
Yes, and it's --
it is a patented arch.

35:07.505 --> 35:10.308
We actually have
two utility patents. Wow.

35:10.308 --> 35:12.210
And we also have a design patent
on the style

35:12.210 --> 35:14.479
that has the open heel.
That's great.

35:14.479 --> 35:18.049
Our utility patent focuses on
our compression arch.

35:18.049 --> 35:21.453
I consulted with
vascular surgeons, PTs.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.988
My stepdad
is a podiatrist.

35:22.988 --> 35:27.058
I-I believe you on the sock.
Talk to me about sales, okay?

35:27.058 --> 35:29.761
Oh, we have sold
120,000 pairs

35:29.761 --> 35:31.563
since we launched
the company.
Whoo!

35:31.563 --> 35:33.365
- How many dollars, dollars?
- Wait. How long ago was that?

35:33.365 --> 35:34.699
$4.1 million.

35:34.699 --> 35:36.101
- 4.1?
- How much? How much?

35:36.101 --> 35:39.704
$4.1 million since we launched
in August 2016.

35:39.704 --> 35:40.939
- But what about this year?
- What last year?

35:40.939 --> 35:43.575
Year to date, we've done
a little over $800,000.

35:43.575 --> 35:44.809
Wow.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.211
We're gonna do
another $800,000...
Wow.

35:46.211 --> 35:48.813
...headed into our busiest
months by the end of the year.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.616
We have a fantastic
return rate of 2%,
giving it the --

35:51.616 --> 35:53.351
Is this direct to consumer?
Or you're selling in retail?

35:53.351 --> 35:56.955
Direct to consumer and --
is 85% of our sales,

35:56.955 --> 35:58.823
15 is wholesale.
You only have a
2% return rate?

35:58.823 --> 36:00.725
2% return rate.
2% -- can you believe that?

36:00.725 --> 36:02.527
That's fantastic.
No, no, no, that's crazy.

36:02.527 --> 36:05.397
So we're gonna get to 1.1 to 1.2
net sales this year,

36:05.397 --> 36:08.133
but this is not the first time
we've broken a million in sales.

36:08.133 --> 36:10.435
2019, we broke a million
in sales,

36:10.435 --> 36:12.003
and then
the pandemic hit.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.072
Our five-year plan
of eventually expanding

36:14.072 --> 36:17.242
outside of the dance community
was immediately accelerated.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.411
So we redid our brand,
our design... Everything.

36:19.411 --> 36:20.812
...our packaging,
our website

36:20.812 --> 36:22.313
to be able
to speak to non-dancers

36:22.313 --> 36:24.082
and still serve
the dance community.

36:24.082 --> 36:27.352
So this year, this year.
We did this massive transition
in one month

36:27.352 --> 36:29.354
and we relaunched
in February. Wow.

36:29.354 --> 36:32.657
We raised our prices
$2 to $7 per pair

36:32.657 --> 36:34.626
without our customers
blinking an eye.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.696
Wow.
That gave us a 20% swing
in our gross margin

36:37.696 --> 36:41.399
from 53% to 73%.
We have several KPI --

36:41.399 --> 36:42.467
- Wow.
- Wow.

36:42.467 --> 36:43.868
You deserve it.
We -- Thank you.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.638
We have a 52%
returning-customer rate.

36:46.638 --> 36:50.275
We now are going to be
profitable this year.

36:50.275 --> 36:53.078
So as we continue to
grab this mass market...

36:53.078 --> 36:54.345
...we're gonna
both profit.

36:54.345 --> 36:55.980
How much do
a pair of socks cost?

36:55.980 --> 36:59.250
They cost between
$6 to $10 per pair.

36:59.250 --> 37:02.187
Wow.
They retail between
$32 and $40 per pair.

37:02.187 --> 37:03.788
- Oh!
- Oy-oy-oy!

37:03.788 --> 37:06.424
- Whoa!
- For a pair of socks?!

37:06.424 --> 37:08.193
They're the best pair of socks
you'll ever own and --

37:08.193 --> 37:09.861
Herjavec: Stop the madness.
They better be.

37:19.270 --> 37:20.572
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,

37:20.572 --> 37:22.207
but they are balking
at the high cost

37:22.207 --> 37:25.276
of Kaycee and Bri's
compression socks, Apolla.

37:25.276 --> 37:27.979
They retail between
$32 and $40 per pair.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.147
- Oh!
- Oy-oy-oy!

37:29.147 --> 37:31.316
- Whoa!
- For a pair of socks?!

37:31.316 --> 37:33.818
- Yeah!
- $4.1 million in sales.

37:33.818 --> 37:35.320
Are you spending a lot of money
on advertising?

37:35.320 --> 37:36.654
Yeah, where are you spending
your money?

37:36.654 --> 37:38.957
It's marketing,
so our operating expenses

37:38.957 --> 37:41.192
are about $40,000
to $45,000 a month.

37:41.192 --> 37:43.528
You're selling socks
for <i>$40.</i>

37:43.528 --> 37:45.463
Well,
one style is $40.

37:45.463 --> 37:48.166
But the thing is,
it's not an ordinary sock.

37:48.166 --> 37:49.567
No. Exactly.
That's what we're trying --
Exactly.

37:49.567 --> 37:51.169
You talked about
the dance community.

37:51.169 --> 37:54.906
I, too, am a member
of the dance community.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.007
You are.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.742
I was a <i>great</i> dancer,

37:57.742 --> 38:00.612
so I understand exactly
what you're talking about.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.114
And I got to be honest with you,
I don't dance anymore --

38:03.114 --> 38:05.517
shamefully so.
I should be practicing again.

38:05.517 --> 38:08.386
But, guys, I'm not your Shark
on this one.

38:08.386 --> 38:09.587
I'm out.

38:09.587 --> 38:10.722
Thank you.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.257
Cuban: This is not
public knowledge,

38:12.257 --> 38:13.892
but I got paid to dance
for the first time

38:13.892 --> 38:16.461
in Folkways Pittsburgh...

38:16.461 --> 38:17.729
What?!
...as a folk dancer, yes.

38:17.729 --> 38:18.630
When I was 16.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.531
That's amazing!
No way.

38:19.531 --> 38:20.999
- When I was 16.
- Who knew?

38:20.999 --> 38:23.501
I also got paid to teach dance
when I was in college.

38:23.501 --> 38:25.036
I knew that.
Put that aside.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.704
This product
has to be demonstrated,

38:26.704 --> 38:28.740
and that's why it's been so hard
for you to sell

38:28.740 --> 38:30.208
and why it hasn't gone viral.

38:30.208 --> 38:33.711
I don't know if you get there,
so for those reasons, I'm out.

38:33.711 --> 38:35.613
Understand. Thank you.
Thank you, Mark.
Thank you.

38:35.613 --> 38:36.981
Look, you're the real deal.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.650
You know your numbers.
You have the background.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.119
Where I'm struggling with --

38:41.119 --> 38:43.054
I don't understand
why it's not more viral,

38:43.054 --> 38:45.890
because
it's an incredible product.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.625
You know, in my world --
In the dance community,
it is.

38:47.625 --> 38:48.893
And that's something
we well understand. Yeah,
we're a well-known brand.

38:48.893 --> 38:51.162
We're worn by
all the top pros.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.798
You name it -- Emmy,
Oscar winner, Tony winners.

38:53.798 --> 38:54.999
It's a smaller market.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.334
It's not for me.
I'm out.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.204
But we have two people
that <i>can</i> get us there, so...

38:59.204 --> 39:00.371
We absolutely know
without a doubt.

39:00.371 --> 39:03.007
...we would like to hear
from Lori and Emma.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.676
Grede: My big, big problem
with this

39:04.676 --> 39:06.778
is that you've been in business
for a long time.

39:06.778 --> 39:09.347
It's not quite growing
at the speed

39:09.347 --> 39:11.549
that I think it should.

39:11.549 --> 39:13.685
Right, there's something
not quite connecting. Yes.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.987
To me, it's just not something
that I feel

39:15.987 --> 39:17.755
that I would be
really passionate about.

39:17.755 --> 39:20.692
I wish you all the best,
but for me, I'm out.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.293
Thank you, Emma.
Thank you.

39:22.293 --> 39:23.862
But wait, there's Lori.
I want touch on one thing,
Lori, though,

39:23.862 --> 39:26.197
is that we are growing
at an insane speed.
We are growing.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.333
We just closed Q2

39:28.333 --> 39:31.669
at an average 100%
year-over-year growth.

39:31.669 --> 39:33.271
Listen, I-I will tell you,

39:33.271 --> 39:38.176
I am a person
who doesn't love socks,

39:38.176 --> 39:42.247
but I'm a person who also has
lived the foot problems, right?

39:42.247 --> 39:44.749
So I look at the two of you,

39:44.749 --> 39:48.419
and you are so smart and fast.

39:48.419 --> 39:50.855
I like people that move fast.
I like people that think fast.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.457
You have all of that.

39:52.457 --> 39:55.593
And I have to say, I have
sat here in high-heel shoes.

39:55.593 --> 39:56.694
Look at this shoe.

39:56.694 --> 39:58.296
I have sat here
in this shoe

39:58.296 --> 40:01.299
with that kind of arch
and incline.

40:01.299 --> 40:03.801
And you know which foot's
more comfortable?

40:03.801 --> 40:04.836
That one.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.871
This one --
not at all, hurts.

40:06.871 --> 40:09.140
This one feels no pain.

40:09.140 --> 40:10.341
Exactly.

40:10.341 --> 40:11.976
These are fantastic...
Eureka!

40:11.976 --> 40:14.145
...fantastic socks.

40:14.145 --> 40:17.248
But I think I understand
why you haven't sold

40:17.248 --> 40:19.150
as well as you could.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.152
And I think that
I can really help you.

40:21.152 --> 40:22.320
You can.
You can.

40:22.320 --> 40:26.324
So for a girl
who doesn't even like socks,

40:26.324 --> 40:29.227
wouldn't wear socks,
you have converted me.

40:29.227 --> 40:32.797
O'Leary: Ooh.
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.

40:32.797 --> 40:34.666
It might not be
one that you like,

40:34.666 --> 40:36.567
but I'm gonna
make you an offer. Okay.

40:36.567 --> 40:40.271
So I'm going to offer you
$300,000,

40:40.271 --> 40:42.473
but I want 25%.

40:42.473 --> 40:44.075
Okay.
Okay.

40:46.177 --> 40:49.514
Lori, would you consider
coming down to 20%?

40:49.514 --> 40:53.818
We are growing 65%.
We have so many great things.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.820
We really want to do a deal.
Can you do 20%?

40:55.820 --> 40:58.156
Here's the problem --
I love you,

40:58.156 --> 41:00.124
<i>but</i> we have a lot to prove,

41:00.124 --> 41:01.926
and we got to get you
into the homes,

41:01.926 --> 41:03.795
like mass, mass, mass.

41:03.795 --> 41:04.595
Yes. Yes.

41:04.595 --> 41:05.730
And that's what I can do.

41:05.730 --> 41:07.165
So I'm holding firm.

41:07.165 --> 41:08.166
Okay.

41:13.938 --> 41:15.173
Lori, you have a deal!

41:15.173 --> 41:16.207
Whoo!

41:16.207 --> 41:18.776
Oh, my gosh!
Yes!

41:18.776 --> 41:23.581
And -- Oh, and -- and
I will so comfortably
walk over in my sock.

41:24.849 --> 41:26.684
I want to hug you, too.

41:26.684 --> 41:28.286
Oh, my God.

41:28.286 --> 41:30.922
They're so good!
They're so good.
I don't know what to do!

41:30.922 --> 41:33.624
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, my God, I love them.

41:33.624 --> 41:35.360
Thank you
from all of our family.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.527
Thank you so much.

41:36.527 --> 41:37.929
- Appreciate the opportunity.
- Thank you.

41:37.929 --> 41:40.031
Congrats, guys.
Well done, guys. Congratulations.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.138
Oh, my God!

41:47.138 --> 41:48.873
It happened!
It happened!

41:53.878 --> 41:56.981
Oh, my God.
Oh, my goodness.

41:56.981 --> 41:58.116
Oh, my God.

41:58.116 --> 42:00.284
I don't want to cry on TV.
Oh, my God.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.523
We just got a deal
with Lori Greiner!

42:05.523 --> 42:09.127
She's our dream partner.
We could not be more thrilled.

42:09.127 --> 42:11.763
We have sacrificed.
Our kids have sacrificed.

42:11.763 --> 42:13.231
Our husbands
have sacrificed.

42:13.231 --> 42:15.600
This is going to
change our life.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.301
So there are
not enough words

42:17.301 --> 42:19.937
to be able to describe to you
what this means.

42:19.937 --> 42:21.439
Thank you so much.

42:21.439 --> 42:23.975
That is one of the craziest
experience of my entire life.
Oh!

42:23.975 --> 42:25.076
And we did it.
I cannot believe
we just did that.
