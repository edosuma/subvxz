You think there's any way you can

Our guys said they can't get us any point

07:45.549 --> 07:47.634
The serial numbers
were burned in the fire.

07:47.718 --> 07:51.680
Is there any evidence the fire was started
intentionally or caused by an explosion?

07:51.763 --> 07:55.934
No. But, ahem, check out Page 3.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.896

Go right there, right there.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.440
[John clears throat]

08:01.565 --> 08:04.443
There. The chemical markers
in the boat's fuel

08:04.526 --> 08:07.988
matched that found on the, uh, girl.

08:08.072 --> 08:10.032
She was on the boat, John.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.616
For sure.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.620
All right, well, let's start simple.
She's on the boat. It was an accident.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.999
End of story?
No. I ain't buying that shit.

08:19.083 --> 08:22.627
No way a 15-year-old girl's gonna be
on a boat like that. Not alone.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.797
Oh, no. Very unlikely.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.092
So there was someone else.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.676
They killed her?

08:29.760 --> 08:31.929
Possibly, and/or immigration.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.597
See, that's where my money's at.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.475
Except she's not gonna cross
the Gulf Stream on her own.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.977
Maybe they made it to dry land.

08:42.356 --> 08:46.610
So, what? We have fire.
Do I check burn wards for survivors?

08:46.693 --> 08:49.154
Burn wards. That's what I'd do.
That's where I'd start.

08:53.284 --> 08:56.495
- Well, this looks like my signature.
- I know.

08:57.121 --> 09:00.832
- Well, it's squiggly.
- That's why I didn't file it.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.211
You really expect me to read all this?

09:04.295 --> 09:08.466
I thought you and John and...
What's his name?

09:08.548 --> 09:09.967
What's his name?

09:10.342 --> 09:11.593
- Kevin.
- Kevin, yeah.

09:11.676 --> 09:15.389
- You were gonna divide it equally.
- It's whatever you like.

09:15.473 --> 09:19.435
If you have anything you want me
to explain or any questions, let me know.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.312
I already signed it.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.272
I know, Dad, but you were in the ICU.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.691
I thought maybe you might have
changed your mind, so I didn't file it.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.988
Nothing's changed.

to do with this, huh?

could work things out.

But I'm your lawyer. If that's
what you want, I will file it today.

- [Little Jake] You got it. What? What?
- [Kevin] Oh, fuck. Fuck.

Dr. Sachs, he wanted us
to put in a new jack plate

14:06.888 --> 14:09.057

when he gets back.

14:09.140 --> 14:12.185

- I know. Please say we can do this.

this guy's business.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.947
But how can you be so sure?

15:06.030 --> 15:08.992
[Meg] Look, you could lobby
the committee for the next year.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.412
But at the end of the day, they won't
let you put in a landing strip.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.998
Well, we cater to a clientele
that expects that access.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.042
You said there's nothing
within the regulations that forbids it.

15:18.126 --> 15:21.755
Right, but you hired me
for my advice.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.924
Even if the committee says yes,
the community won't allow it.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.968
But it's not impossible?

15:27.051 --> 15:30.221
[Meg] It'll be a waste of your time
and your resources.

15:30.305 --> 15:34.726
If it's a deal breaker, you might
consider pulling out of the project.

15:37.688 --> 15:39.272
Okay.

Well, is it a deal breaker?

- No. Coach Louie took--

16:03.046 --> 16:08.092
He's at third base right now, Pa.
He's at third base. Get out of here!

16:08.176 --> 16:11.555
Hey, thanks for coming out today.
It means a lot to him. It really does.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.348
Thank you so much.

So how's he going

- Never mind, Dad.

16:32.242 --> 16:36.120
I wished that I looked half as good
as he did when I was his age.

16:36.204 --> 16:39.165
I would have done a little better
in the friendship department.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.709

16:44.462 --> 16:48.007
When did everybody get wrapped so tight?
I thought I asked it quiet enough.

- [Kevin] Let's go, kid!

- [Belle] Not fair.

Oh, she's always
doing something out there. Yoohoo!

17:03.064 --> 17:05.567
- I forgot the tonic.
- Oh, I brought it.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.068
Nice.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.530
- Hey.
- I'm so glad to be out of that hospital.

17:10.948 --> 17:13.658
I wish I could stay longer.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.243
Don't apologize today. Come on.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.370
[Meg] Yeah.
Just relax and have fun, Mom.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.038
Let the wheels stop turning.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.416
Well, I do really only have an hour.

Good, 58 more minutes.
Who's tending bar?

Gotta be 5 p.m. somewhere.

- Yeah.
- Hey, Mama.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.848
I'm sorry I didn't get to the hospital.

17:39.017 --> 17:42.020
I'm not good at doing hospitals.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.897
Oh. Don't worry about it.

17:46.650 --> 17:48.986
There's probably tequila
if you want it, Mom.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.530
I think somebody's trying
to get me drunk. Oh, look.

17:52.614 --> 17:55.492
- She just pours.
- I just pour. You get yourself drunk.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.459

- To Mom.

18:04.542 --> 18:07.337

- [Meg] Eyes.
- This is creepy.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.883
[crowd chattering]

18:18.348 --> 18:19.724
[woman]
Go, boys!

18:34.948 --> 18:37.909
All right, boys, look alive!
Here we go!

18:37.993 --> 18:40.996
Please, God.
Please, God. Get a hit.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.582
[mosquito buzzing]

18:46.668 --> 18:49.420
[Kevin] Has he been
sneaking beers in here or something?

18:49.504 --> 18:50.922
What?

18:51.006 --> 18:52.590
Look at Dad.

18:53.591 --> 18:54.885
Let's go!

18:57.095 --> 18:58.805
I'll take him home.

18:58.889 --> 19:01.933
No, leave him. He needs his rest.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.029
[♪♪♪]

19:42.891 --> 19:43.892
[inaudible dialogue]

19:44.017 --> 19:45.476
Hey, Pop.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.983
You want me to take you home?

19:53.568 --> 19:55.070
Nope.

19:56.571 --> 19:58.239
[sighs]

20:01.242 --> 20:02.535
What's the score?

20:02.619 --> 20:03.494
[all laughing]

20:03.578 --> 20:05.038
No, we should have it at the inn.

20:05.122 --> 20:08.374
Oh, I would love to see Janie
and her friends all dressed up.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.500
[soft folk music playing]

20:09.584 --> 20:11.836
- I had mine on the front lawn.
- [Belle] That could be fun.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.713
Oh, it was so fun!

20:13.797 --> 20:17.550
Do you remember--?
Until Kevin and John crashed the party

20:17.634 --> 20:21.012
and started singing with the band,
trying to impress my friends.

20:21.096 --> 20:23.140
My husband should never
be near a microphone.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.349
[Sally] Never let him sing
in front of the children.

20:25.433 --> 20:29.228
[Diana] Janie's talking about wanting
to keep it real small.

20:29.312 --> 20:34.067
Kevin told me about what happened.
I just... If you want to talk, I'm here.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.987
- Thanks. Not now.
- [Diana] She wants it on the boat.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.363
Have an overnighter
with her best friends.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.698
Oh.

20:41.699 --> 20:45.162
- Is she old enough for that?
- One of us would go with them.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.746
- I mean...
- [Sally] Oh!

20:46.830 --> 20:48.372
Then that's fine.

20:48.456 --> 20:52.502
I wanna be with my friends and parents
on a boat in the middle of the ocean.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.171
What do you think's gonna happen?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.880
- I don't know.
- She's 16.

20:55.964 --> 20:59.634
Well, I just was a little bit
worried there for a second.

20:59.717 --> 21:00.885
[belches]

21:01.178 --> 21:04.514
- [Sally] Whoa!
- [Meg] Ew! God.

21:04.639 --> 21:06.265
- Well done.
- [Diana] Did you hear that?

21:06.349 --> 21:07.517
- Yes!
- [Sally] Okay, that's it.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.520
I'm done. Give me another glass
of chardonnay.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.412
- [Robert] Thanks.
- [John] You coming?

21:28.496 --> 21:30.707
- [Robert] Yep. Yep.
- [John] You all right?

21:31.749 --> 21:33.126
Yeah?

21:36.546 --> 21:40.008
That was a pretty good catch
old Ben made, huh? In left field.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.052
- Yeah.
- Out of bounds.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.430
Dad, you gave, uh...

21:46.890 --> 21:49.517
You gave myself, Meg and Kevin
the decision on whether

21:49.600 --> 21:52.270
Danny was gonna stay or not.
You remember that, don't you?

21:52.353 --> 21:54.480
I remember that.

21:57.901 --> 22:01.487
We decided all together
that he shouldn't stay, but I--

22:02.280 --> 22:05.366
I told Danny that that was your decision.

22:07.202 --> 22:09.787
I lied. I'm sorry. I...

22:10.788 --> 22:12.874
Well, we all lie.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.428
[Kevin]
How's it going?

22:26.637 --> 22:28.223
[Danny]
This fucking thing, man.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.852
You know, I just--
I can't get this thing to turn over.

22:32.936 --> 22:35.479
Didn't I tell you not to start
messing with this truck?

22:35.563 --> 22:37.440
Who told you not to mess
with this truck?

22:37.523 --> 22:39.358
Could have tried
some reverse psychology.

22:39.442 --> 22:43.029
Hey, you got any ideas? Look,
changed the carb. Changed the battery.

22:43.113 --> 22:46.199
Changed all the ignition shit.
I still can't get it to turn over.

22:46.283 --> 22:47.700
What about the cap and rotor?

22:48.492 --> 22:49.786
- Did you?
- No.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.412
- Fine. I'll look at it.
- Yeah?

22:51.495 --> 22:53.331
Because I gotta go do the welcome tour.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.374
- All right. Go. Go.
- All right. Thanks, man.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.168
Ugh.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.837
If you're doing the tour,
take a shower.

23:00.338 --> 23:03.216
- [Danny] Oh, you think?
- Yeah. You smell like ass.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.135
[Danny]
Fucking hell.

23:05.218 --> 23:08.471
That's the pot calling the kettle black.
I mean, man.

23:08.554 --> 23:11.308
You're the fucking smelliest
motherfucker in the family.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.435
[Kevin laughing] That's it,
you motherfucker. You'd better run.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.647
[cell phone ringing]

23:18.481 --> 23:20.566
- Rayburn.
- John.

23:20.650 --> 23:24.779
Yeah, I got a call on my way in.
I think we may have caught a break.

23:24.862 --> 23:27.531
I'm at the Oceanside Marina.
Can you make it down here?

23:27.615 --> 23:29.200
So how's everything going?

23:29.284 --> 23:31.995
Well, I got a call
from Mr. Morris late last night.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.498
He's decided not to move forward
with the project here.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.208
Oh.

23:37.292 --> 23:40.086
Yeah, he's gonna start looking
at other locations.

23:41.212 --> 23:44.341
Well, that's probably the best decision.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.718
- Thank you for letting me know.
- Of course.

23:47.802 --> 23:50.680
I hope your firm was happy
with the service.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.350
Actually, that's something
I wanted to discuss with you.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.435
Alec mentioned it,
but I would have said the same thing.

23:56.519 --> 24:00.481
We were all very happy.
Frankly, impressed.

24:01.399 --> 24:04.068
Have you ever considered
joining a larger firm?

24:04.819 --> 24:07.613
[laughs] Oh, God. Uh...

24:07.947 --> 24:11.201
I have a lot of FSU law friends who did.

24:11.284 --> 24:13.911
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Miami, D.C., Houston.

24:13.995 --> 24:16.873
- I did my third year summer in Dallas.
- Mm.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.416
So I've seen that world.

24:18.499 --> 24:21.044
Yeah? Any appeal?

24:21.252 --> 24:22.670
Oh...

24:22.920 --> 24:25.173
I don't know.
Work 80 hours a week.

24:25.256 --> 24:28.592
Just to make enough to vacation
in a place like this.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.261
Fair enough.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.015
- I'm gonna tell you a little secret.
- Yeah.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.267
I actually don't give a shit
about the law.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.646
- Does anybody?
- [laughs] I don't know.

24:40.730 --> 24:44.775
But I do like helping people. And I get
to do a lot of different stuff here.

24:44.859 --> 24:48.029
Family law, estate planning.
I help my parents with their business.

24:48.112 --> 24:52.283
- That's great.
- My family lives here. We're very close.

24:52.367 --> 24:54.785
No, I get it.
I'm from a big family myself.

24:54.869 --> 24:56.079
- Vermont.
- Oh.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.289
A place almost as beautiful as this.

24:58.373 --> 25:00.624
- Without the heat, of course.
- Oh, God.

25:00.708 --> 25:04.837
I don't know how the fuck you people do it
down here. Unbelievable. Thank you.

25:04.921 --> 25:06.297
[waitress] Uh-huh.

25:06.381 --> 25:09.926
- Have you ever been to New York?
- [Meg] A couple of times.

25:10.009 --> 25:13.679
It's a completely different world there.
You could really stretch yourself.

25:13.763 --> 25:17.683
Personally, it'd be great
to have someone like you.

25:17.767 --> 25:21.479
Someone with your perspective
working at the firm.

25:21.562 --> 25:23.064
You should give it some thought.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.318
I appreciate that.

25:27.402 --> 25:29.862
Don't appreciate it.
I want you to consider it.

25:29.946 --> 25:34.325
Let us fly you up there. Show you around
the firm. You can meet some people.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.620
Um, I--

25:37.995 --> 25:40.206
I'm flattered. Truly. Thank you.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.334
Okay.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.337
Oh, and just between us...

25:47.380 --> 25:50.925
I put in 60 hours, tops.

25:54.345 --> 25:57.474
Gas with the same chemical marker
found on the boat and the girl

25:57.556 --> 25:59.725
was stolen from here two weeks ago.

25:59.809 --> 26:01.769
- What about those?
- Yeah, I saw that.

26:01.852 --> 26:05.022
Owner said the cameras have been here
since he bought the place.

26:05.106 --> 26:06.357
They never worked.

26:06.441 --> 26:08.776
Well, that's useful, isn't it?

26:08.859 --> 26:10.903
The only other place
where you can get gas

26:10.987 --> 26:14.615
with this same exact chemical marker
is south of Marathon.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.784
- Marathon, huh?
- Yeah.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.578
So they steal the fuel,
they fill the boats,

26:19.662 --> 26:21.872
they take them back
wherever they came from.

26:21.956 --> 26:23.749
And it explodes.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.128
- Your eyes all right?
- Yeah, why?

26:27.211 --> 26:28.921
Just wondering.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.425
Hey, why don't you find out
who owns this boat?

26:32.509 --> 26:33.926
Why?

26:34.010 --> 26:35.678
Because of that.

26:38.389 --> 26:40.724
Ah, come on. I mean...

26:42.018 --> 26:43.853
All right.

26:43.936 --> 26:47.565
Eight a.m. to 11 a.m.,
then we begin serving lunch at midday.

26:47.648 --> 26:50.109
That goes to 2, 2:30.

26:50.193 --> 26:52.236
And later on this afternoon,
near sunset,

26:52.320 --> 26:56.115
we're gonna take you out
on a cocktail cruise.

26:56.199 --> 26:58.451
What a depressing place to grow up.

26:58.909 --> 27:01.454
Yeah. Yeah, it's the worst.

27:01.538 --> 27:02.580
[Pearl]
Mom, Mom!

27:02.663 --> 27:04.623
[Ginny] Dad. There are flowers
growing out of the trees.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.334
Where?

27:06.417 --> 27:08.211
Why don't you show them, girls?

27:08.294 --> 27:09.712
Please, after you.

27:13.049 --> 27:15.259
[Danny]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:15.343 --> 27:18.429
That is Mama Ray's handiwork right there.

27:18.513 --> 27:19.430
[Ginny]
Can we pick them?

27:19.514 --> 27:21.265
[Vera] We can enjoy looking
without touching.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.726
- [Ginny] Can I put one in my hair?
- [Pearl] I'll climb and get it.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.686
Look, I'll see what I can do, okay?

27:25.769 --> 27:26.645
[ukulele playing]

27:26.729 --> 27:30.274
Oh, that's my dad.
That's my dad. That's Papa Ray.

27:30.358 --> 27:32.402
Wave and say, "Hi, Papa Ray."

27:32.485 --> 27:34.862
[all]
Hi, Papa Ray.

27:34.945 --> 27:37.532
Actually, out on this cruise
that we're gonna go out to

27:37.615 --> 27:40.784
is the best place anywhere
to see the sunset.

27:40.868 --> 27:45.039
Which is a great Keys tradition.
Also, Didi makes a mean margarita.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.917
- Now, that's what I could use.
- [Danny] Yeah. Long flight?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.420
- Bumpy.
- I'm not the greatest of flyers.

27:50.503 --> 27:54.298
Well, you're here now. The only thing
you gotta worry about is not worrying.

27:54.382 --> 27:56.634
- [Ronald] Sign us up for that, yeah?
- [Danny] Cool.

27:56.717 --> 28:00.263
Let's bring you over to the bar,
and let you get one of those margaritas.

28:00.346 --> 28:04.767
How about that? Oh, look. The ladies look
like they're enjoying themselves already.

28:04.850 --> 28:08.396
The big questions here
are salt or no salt.

28:08.479 --> 28:10.856
And that's it.
It starts quick once you get here.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.650
And we try to do everything we can

28:12.733 --> 28:14.860
to make sure you don't have
to do anything.

28:14.944 --> 28:16.987
Oh, we know this at the inn...

28:18.114 --> 28:20.824
[inaudible dialogue]

28:22.034 --> 28:25.455
And to that end, anything
that you guys think of that you need,

28:25.538 --> 28:27.748
any questions you have, anything,

28:27.831 --> 28:30.293
please don't hesitate to ask me
or one of our...

28:30.627 --> 28:32.836
[rock music playing over speakers]

28:33.045 --> 28:35.298
[camera shutter clicking]

28:51.648 --> 28:53.691
[Kevin]
Nicky!

28:54.858 --> 28:55.943
[Nick]
Kevin.

28:56.026 --> 28:58.655
I thought we lost you
to those Berkeley fuckers for good.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.823
- Stanford.
- Mm.

29:01.031 --> 29:03.867
My bad. So, what are you doing home?

29:03.951 --> 29:07.163
- You miss the fishing?
- I came to help my mom.

29:07.246 --> 29:10.374
She officially put the property
back on the market.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.376
- We got a few buyers.
- Yeah, I saw.

29:12.460 --> 29:15.254
Those Merrill Lynch-looking douche bags.

29:15.338 --> 29:18.508
Looking for some property
to build a vacation home together?

29:18.591 --> 29:21.844
- They're developers.
- Developers.

29:21.927 --> 29:26.182
- What do they want to develop?
- It's not really my business. Or yours.

29:27.558 --> 29:29.935
I'm sure they'll clean
this place up though.

29:30.019 --> 29:32.271
Even Florida deserves a bit of class.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.940
Listen, Nick, I wanna make an offer.

29:35.024 --> 29:36.693
[Nick scoffs]

29:38.235 --> 29:41.197
We seem to be pretty far downfield
with these guys.

29:41.739 --> 29:44.867
Besides, how can you afford it?

29:46.661 --> 29:50.748
- You're barely staying afloat as it is.
- I'm doing just fine.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.001
Okay, Kev.

30:05.137 --> 30:08.140
[man speaking indistinctly
on monitor]

30:14.397 --> 30:18.317
[Marco] Yeah, it's a good thing
you made me get this footage. Heh.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.238
[John]
There.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.409
[Marco]
All right.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.494
[typing on keyboard]

30:28.911 --> 30:30.788
I'm trying to back it up.

30:31.622 --> 30:33.791
[John]
Just hold it there, would you?

30:35.292 --> 30:38.087
- They can't get any clearer on that?
- No. I mean--

30:38.170 --> 30:39.714
You've asked?

30:39.797 --> 30:42.508
No. You know what? I'll ask.

30:42.592 --> 30:46.429
I'm pretty sure this was the best
they could do. You know?

30:51.392 --> 30:55.813

49:10.699 --> 49:11.949
And more.

49:13.117 --> 49:14.118
[chuckles]

49:14.410 --> 49:16.954
Because it feels to me
like we're in a negotiation now.

49:17.038 --> 49:20.291
So why don't you come talk to me
when you're sitting at my table?

49:21.543 --> 49:25.046
- Do you know how much money this is?
- It's not enough. That's not enough.

49:25.129 --> 49:26.756
I know I'm not in the will.

49:30.886 --> 49:34.055
Why don't you show me
what it's worth to you?

49:34.138 --> 49:36.516
I mean, really show me
what it's worth to you

49:36.599 --> 49:38.434
to protect your family.

49:38.518 --> 49:40.687
Rayburns.

49:40.770 --> 49:42.438
Go on. Show me.

49:42.522 --> 49:44.941
Not just tell me about it.
Really show me.

49:45.024 --> 49:47.235
I am showing you!

49:49.153 --> 49:51.239
That's not enough.

49:51.322 --> 49:53.324
I mean, I will leave.

49:54.158 --> 49:55.869
For a price.

50:04.544 --> 50:06.003
Okay.

50:10.550 --> 50:12.093
Okay.

50:14.429 --> 50:16.138
Tomorrow morning...

50:19.434 --> 50:23.813
you tell me your price, and I'll wire it
to you wherever you are.

50:23.897 --> 50:25.941
I will. I'll wire it to you.

50:36.409 --> 50:37.994
Deal.

50:47.712 --> 50:51.466
You will never see my face again, Dad.
