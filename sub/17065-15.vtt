WEBVTT

00:00.305 --> 00:01.671
<i>I love a good yard sale,</i>

00:01.740 --> 00:04.273
<i>but in Westport,
they're called "estate sales."</i>

00:04.398 --> 00:05.830
<i>Wait, I didn't hit that hard enough.</i>

00:05.899 --> 00:07.802
<i>"Estate sales."</i>

00:07.903 --> 00:10.130
Okay, it's just a bunch of stuff

00:10.233 --> 00:11.480
a dead person's kids don't want.

00:11.505 --> 00:14.406
- Calm down.
- Let us in! Let us in!

00:14.475 --> 00:15.908
- Let us in!
- Oh, no.

00:15.977 --> 00:17.209
There's stupid Chloe Brown Mueller

00:17.278 --> 00:19.244
and her husband, stupid Stan Lawton.

00:19.413 --> 00:20.746
Ooh, we should call them over.

00:20.815 --> 00:22.748
Greg, I wasn't using "stupid"
to mean, like, "funky fresh."

00:22.817 --> 00:23.849
I really don't like them.

00:23.918 --> 00:25.884
I mean, Stan's okay,
but Chloe's the worst.

00:25.953 --> 00:29.488
She's always mommy-blogging and
Instagraming, and to top it all off...

00:29.557 --> 00:31.359
Hey, Stan, it's me... Greg!

00:31.437 --> 00:33.361
Did you just wave them over here?

00:33.461 --> 00:36.228
Greg, you will never believe
what I just saw.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.496
See that table?

00:37.565 --> 00:38.897
- See the racist mugs?
- Uh-huh.

00:38.966 --> 00:42.658
Right next to that are actual arrowheads
made by the Paugussett tribe.

00:42.798 --> 00:44.069
Ah, the original settlers of Westport.

00:44.138 --> 00:45.938
Mm, we could have been better to them.

00:46.006 --> 00:48.040
Slaughtered them,
drove them from their lands,

00:48.109 --> 00:49.341
such a tragic history.

00:49.410 --> 00:51.009
Yes, but they do have
that nice plaque on Main Street.

00:51.078 --> 00:52.578
- That's true!
- Mm-hmm.

00:52.646 --> 00:55.948
- After you, sir.
- No, no, after you, sir.

00:56.016 --> 00:57.951
- So, Katie, how's everything?
- Let's not.

00:58.006 --> 01:00.219
Okay, good, because I didn't care.

01:00.387 --> 01:02.688
<i>What kind of yard sale is this?</i>

01:02.756 --> 01:04.456
<i>Where are all the neon beer signs?</i>

01:04.525 --> 01:05.824
<i>Where's that singing bass</i>

01:05.893 --> 01:08.060
<i>telling me to take it to the river?</i>

01:08.128 --> 01:09.695
Whoa.

01:09.763 --> 01:13.432
<i>Four perfectly weathered
Adirondack chairs for only $85!</i>

01:13.500 --> 01:14.833
<i>Be cool, Katie.</i>

01:14.902 --> 01:16.902
<i>Don't attract attention
to this awesome deal.</i>

01:16.971 --> 01:20.005
Everyone back off! These are mine. So...

01:23.744 --> 01:25.310
Oh. Excuse me!

01:25.379 --> 01:28.080
- I'd like to buy these.
- No, I'm sprawled here.

01:28.148 --> 01:31.516
It's the universal sign for,
"These are my chairs."

01:31.585 --> 01:34.007
Choking... These are my chairs.

01:34.125 --> 01:36.622
Okay, that's how a garage sale works.

01:36.690 --> 01:38.023
This is a tag sale,

01:38.092 --> 01:40.525
so whoever has the tag gets the sale.

01:40.594 --> 01:42.427
And since I have the tag,

01:42.496 --> 01:43.996
who do you think gets the sale?

01:44.064 --> 01:45.430
Do you think it's you?

01:45.499 --> 01:46.565
'Cause it's not.

01:46.634 --> 01:48.066
It's me.

01:48.135 --> 01:49.034
Okay, pumpkin?

01:51.472 --> 01:52.905
Hey, if you're gonna be in my selfie,

01:52.973 --> 01:54.306
the least you can do is smile.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.742
Or at least do something
more flattering with those legs.

01:56.810 --> 01:59.678
Another universal sign coming at you.

02:00.547 --> 02:02.080
I'll crop you out.

02:05.452 --> 02:08.320
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

02:13.394 --> 02:15.027
The only reason she bought those chairs

02:15.095 --> 02:16.428
is because I wanted them.

02:16.497 --> 02:18.563
And the worst part about it
is they belonged to Paul Newman.

02:18.632 --> 02:19.798
Oh, what makes you think that?

02:19.867 --> 02:21.266
Paul Newman lived in Westport.

02:22.870 --> 02:25.370
He used chairs. Connect the dots.

02:25.439 --> 02:28.340
You and Chloe should really talk
this out on our double date tonight.

02:28.409 --> 02:29.774
- Our what?
- Stan planned it.

02:29.844 --> 02:32.110
We're having dinner at one restaurant
and the dessert at another.

02:32.179 --> 02:35.047
"Can he be any more fun?" I ask,
but the answer is clearly no.

02:35.115 --> 02:36.782
Okay, before you break out

02:36.850 --> 02:38.517
into "I Am Sixteen Going on Seventeen,"

02:38.585 --> 02:40.218
you need to know that I won't be there.

02:40.287 --> 02:41.620
Oh, why not?

02:41.689 --> 02:43.255
I'm not having dinner
with Chloe Brown Mueller,

02:43.324 --> 02:46.224
but if you would like to have
a single date with Stan,

02:46.293 --> 02:47.559
be my guest.

02:47.628 --> 02:49.695
I guess it's boys' night out.

02:49.763 --> 02:51.063
Going big tonight.

02:51.131 --> 02:53.231
I should take an extra Zantac.

03:00.574 --> 03:02.441
What happened to
the pony pencil case I gave you?

03:02.509 --> 03:04.042
A girl at school took it.

03:04.111 --> 03:06.211
I asked for it back, but she pushed me

03:06.280 --> 03:08.947
and used one of Mama's
angry driving words.

03:09.016 --> 03:11.316
- Did you tell a teacher?
- She told me I better not,

03:11.385 --> 03:15.120
then used one of Mama's angry
talking-about-Grandma words.

03:15.189 --> 03:16.588
That girl sounds like a bully.

03:16.657 --> 03:17.923
You need to stand up to her.

03:17.992 --> 03:19.324
And I'm gonna teach you how.

03:19.393 --> 03:21.393
Shouldn't we loop in an adult on this?

03:21.462 --> 03:23.562
Advice from Taylor is rarely good.

03:23.630 --> 03:25.831
I peed sitting down for way too long.

03:25.899 --> 03:27.099
I know what to do.

03:27.167 --> 03:28.166
When I was her age,

03:28.235 --> 03:30.268
this girl Erin Smith
teased me every day.

03:30.337 --> 03:31.636
She called me a "lezzie"

03:31.705 --> 03:33.772
because she thought
that I was less than.

03:33.841 --> 03:35.874
That is not what Erin meant.

03:35.943 --> 03:38.577
Then one day, Erin pushed me too far,

03:38.645 --> 03:41.580
so I walked right up to her
and punched her in the nose.

03:41.648 --> 03:43.515
After that, the bullying stopped.

03:43.584 --> 03:46.284
So if someone's treating me badly,
I should punch them?

03:46.353 --> 03:47.386
Right in the nose.

03:47.454 --> 03:48.453
Thanks, Taylor.

03:48.522 --> 03:50.155
When she called you "lezzie,"

03:50.224 --> 03:53.091
was that when you had short hair
and were playing softball?

03:53.160 --> 03:54.192
Yeah.

03:54.261 --> 03:55.627
I thought you were less than, too.

03:59.466 --> 04:02.034
Stan and I had the best time ever.

04:02.102 --> 04:03.969
Over drinks, we...
do you want the full recap

04:04.038 --> 04:05.704
where you glaze over,
or should I skip to the end?

04:05.773 --> 04:07.172
Skip to the end.

04:07.241 --> 04:10.342
And then Stan said,
"No, at the Levitt Pavilion."

04:10.411 --> 04:11.810
Sounds great.

04:11.879 --> 04:13.045
I'm happy you had fun

04:13.113 --> 04:14.846
with your new best friend
in the whole wide world.

04:14.915 --> 04:16.815
I know you're teasing me,
but I don't care

04:16.884 --> 04:19.151
'cause my best friend
in the whole wide world

04:19.219 --> 04:21.753
invited us to the
Mayflower Descendant's Reception

04:21.822 --> 04:23.188
at the Westport Colonial Fair!

04:23.257 --> 04:24.756
There's a silly group of words.

04:24.825 --> 04:26.825
It's a reception honoring the
descendants of the Mayflower.

04:26.894 --> 04:29.861
Stan is one, and he offered to
bring us as his personal guests.

04:29.930 --> 04:30.896
Will Chloe be there?

04:30.964 --> 04:32.731
Of course.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.467
Oh, I think I'm coming down
with something.

04:35.536 --> 04:36.668
- Katie.
- If you want,

04:36.737 --> 04:39.871
I will really commit
and eat a dirty tissue.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.273
This invitation is a real honor.

04:41.341 --> 04:42.507
I can't turn Stan down.

04:42.576 --> 04:43.842
He's my first real friend in Westport.

04:43.911 --> 04:46.144
You have a ton of friends.
What about Doris' husband?

04:48.000 --> 04:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:58.125 --> 05:00.725
Dave, you have no idea

05:00.794 --> 05:04.029
how much you're saving me right now.

05:04.098 --> 05:05.595
Exactly my point.

05:05.675 --> 05:08.567
For me, Chloe Brown Mueller
is just as bad as Richard.

05:08.635 --> 05:10.969
That wasn't your point. You were actually
trying to make the opposite point.

05:11.038 --> 05:13.038
It's not important
where the good idea comes from,

05:13.107 --> 05:16.775
the takeaway is I am not spending
an entire day at the fair with her.

05:16.844 --> 05:18.643
You know, I do a lot of stuff for you

05:18.712 --> 05:19.978
that I don't want to do.

05:20.047 --> 05:21.513
I'm cashing in some of my marital chips.

05:21.565 --> 05:23.165
- Chips?
- Yeah, chips.

05:23.236 --> 05:25.750
Points I get for going along with
things you want to do when I don't.

05:25.819 --> 05:28.009
Like what?

05:28.555 --> 05:30.589
What happened to the afghan my
Nana knitted us for our wedding?

05:30.657 --> 05:33.792
Well, like Nana,
it's in a box and put to rest.

05:35.562 --> 05:37.863
Thanks for agreeing to drive tonight.

05:37.931 --> 05:40.999
Oh, sorry, hon, I'm already four deep.

05:42.736 --> 05:45.337
Let's see "Trois Souvenirs
De Ma Jeunesse."

05:45.405 --> 05:46.905
It's a French film
about an anthropologist

05:46.974 --> 05:49.407
reflecting on his life
before moving to Tajikistan.

05:49.476 --> 05:51.710
We're seeing "Batman v Superman:
Dawn of Justice."

05:53.313 --> 05:55.313
But you loved "Batman v Superman."

05:55.382 --> 05:56.915
I only said that to make you happy.

05:56.984 --> 05:59.050
"Batman v Superman" makes no sense.

05:59.119 --> 06:01.620
What?! That movie is amazing.

06:01.688 --> 06:03.321
Batman, the world's greatest detective,

06:03.390 --> 06:05.857
doesn't know Superman's weakness
until Lex Luthor tells him.

06:05.926 --> 06:07.559
There are five dream sequences
in the movie.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.728
None of them reveal anything
about any character.

06:09.796 --> 06:11.763
And, most importantly,
Superman has heat vision.

06:11.832 --> 06:14.199
He should have melted Batman
in the first act, movie over.

06:14.268 --> 06:15.834
But so much stuff blew up.

06:15.903 --> 06:17.269
You have the best husband around.

06:17.337 --> 06:18.703
- I know that.
- Do you?

06:18.772 --> 06:20.305
Because I'm pretty damn accommodating.

06:20.374 --> 06:22.774
Mostly because I don't care and
I'm happy to sacrifice for you.

06:22.843 --> 06:23.942
But not on this one.

06:24.011 --> 06:25.443
Every day around here is Katie time.

06:25.512 --> 06:27.012
Right now, it's Greg time.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.346
Mm, I don't know.

06:28.415 --> 06:30.348
Sounds like you're messing
with a system that works.

06:33.887 --> 06:35.153
Fine.

06:35.222 --> 06:36.922
I'll go.

06:36.990 --> 06:38.423
And at the fair, you're gonna play nice

06:38.492 --> 06:40.425
with Chloe Brown Mueller
because it's important to me.

06:40.494 --> 06:42.327
Can I pull the "I had your babies" card?

06:42.396 --> 06:44.663
- No.
- Damn it.

06:47.064 --> 06:49.354
Look, they've got a blacksmith,
a cobbler, and a candle maker.

06:49.449 --> 06:50.649
Of course, in the period,

06:50.717 --> 06:52.329
people traditionally
made their own candles at home,

06:52.407 --> 06:55.052
- but I'm not gonna pull that thread.
- Yeah, we'll keep it light today.

06:55.121 --> 06:59.423
Westport is one of the leading
onion producers in the colonies.

06:59.492 --> 07:02.860
And this is what an onion looks like.

07:02.929 --> 07:04.161
- Touch it.
- No.

07:04.230 --> 07:05.329
Pass it around.

07:06.499 --> 07:08.699
- Isn't this fun?
- So fun.

07:08.768 --> 07:10.735
You there, the continental army

07:10.803 --> 07:12.903
needs able-bodied men as recruits.

07:12.972 --> 07:14.438
Will you help us fight the British?

07:14.507 --> 07:15.940
A million times yes.

07:16.009 --> 07:17.575
Actually, you're a minuteman,

07:17.644 --> 07:19.043
not a continental army regular.

07:19.112 --> 07:20.811
Stan, keeping him honest.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.514
- Mm-hmm. Flagon of mead?
- Love it.

07:24.617 --> 07:28.252
Could you get a wide shot
of me holding this musket?

07:28.321 --> 07:30.921
'Course, but what sort
of contraption is this?

07:30.990 --> 07:32.957
I've... I've never seen
anything like it.

07:33.026 --> 07:34.859
Okay, just cut the crap
and take the picture.

07:34.927 --> 07:35.993
Okay.

07:38.431 --> 07:39.717
<i>I'd do anything for Superman</i>

07:39.819 --> 07:42.210
<i>or Batman to come down here
and kill all these people.</i>

07:42.301 --> 07:44.335
Good day, madam, do you want
to learn how to churn butter?

07:44.403 --> 07:45.636
I really don't.

07:45.705 --> 07:48.139
You there, you look like a woman
who can churn butter.

07:48.207 --> 07:50.508
I don't know what that means,
but it sounds hurtful.

07:50.576 --> 07:51.776
Hello, young lady,

07:51.844 --> 07:53.577
have you ever touched
a butter churn before?

07:53.646 --> 07:55.946
What is it with you people
and the butter?!

07:57.450 --> 07:58.983
<i>Thank God, a bench.</i>

07:59.051 --> 08:02.186
<i>Finally, something
that doesn't make butter.</i>

08:02.255 --> 08:03.387
Hey.

08:03.456 --> 08:05.856
Stop writing "chair thief"
on all of my posts.

08:05.925 --> 08:07.525
Why, whatever do you mean?

08:07.593 --> 08:09.794
I know "Addy Rondack" is you.

08:09.862 --> 08:11.829
I don't know who Addy Rondack
is, but that's a good pun.

08:11.898 --> 08:14.165
She seems like a very smart lady.

08:14.233 --> 08:16.667
Well, she keeps saying that
I stole Paul Newman's chairs,

08:16.736 --> 08:18.869
and now I got Joanne Woodward
up my ass about it.

08:18.938 --> 08:21.238
- Ladies, there you are.
- Oh.

08:21.307 --> 08:23.641
We have some very exciting news.

08:23.709 --> 08:24.831
This weekend, the four of us

08:24.911 --> 08:26.143
are gonna participate
in a reenactment of...

08:26.212 --> 08:27.278
The Battle of Ridgefield!

08:27.346 --> 08:29.513
I apologize.
I stole that moment from you.

08:29.582 --> 08:30.514
Please, go ahead.

08:30.583 --> 08:31.716
The Battle of Ridgefield!

08:31.784 --> 08:33.751
Women can either be dying civilians

08:33.820 --> 08:35.219
or blood-covered nurses.

08:35.288 --> 08:36.220
Strong opinions?

08:37.390 --> 08:38.389
- Either way.
- Mm.

08:38.457 --> 08:39.990
Blood-covered nurses it is.

08:40.058 --> 08:41.826
Tonight,
we'll rehearse your distant look

08:41.894 --> 08:43.227
as you remember happier times

08:43.296 --> 08:45.396
before you knew the sound of
a saw blade on a gangrenous leg.

08:45.465 --> 08:46.831
He's so fun.

08:46.899 --> 08:48.733
Ooh, butter churning! Come on, hon.

08:49.869 --> 08:51.435
Do we have to go?

08:51.504 --> 08:52.737
Yes. You owe me.

08:52.805 --> 08:54.071
But you already spent your chips.

08:54.140 --> 08:56.373
- I have so many more.
- How many more?

08:56.442 --> 08:58.909
Take in this dramatic pause.

09:00.146 --> 09:01.345
So many.

09:01.414 --> 09:02.346
Oh.

09:05.084 --> 09:07.351
<i>I need to find a way
to get Chloe out of my life.</i>

09:07.420 --> 09:08.886
<i>Maybe I'll try the strategy</i>

09:08.955 --> 09:10.721
<i>they used to win
the Battle of Ridgefield,</i>

09:10.790 --> 09:12.623
<i>but that means I'd have to look it up.</i>

09:12.692 --> 09:14.325
<i>So I won't.</i>

09:20.466 --> 09:22.299
Hey, you're in my spot.

09:22.368 --> 09:24.168
Sorry, Anna-Kat, you snooze, you...

09:24.237 --> 09:26.237
What the hell?

09:26.305 --> 09:27.505
You're being a bully.

09:27.573 --> 09:30.274
Anna-Kat, good for you
standing up for yourself.

09:30.343 --> 09:31.609
Are you both out of your minds?

09:31.677 --> 09:34.478
I'm bleeding!

09:34.547 --> 09:38.082
I don't know what Mom
is always complaining about.

09:38.151 --> 09:41.218
This parenting thing
is super ascertaining.

09:41.287 --> 09:42.286
Am I using that right?

09:42.355 --> 09:43.654
No.

09:48.427 --> 09:50.561
At the colonial fair,
I should have stuck your head

09:50.630 --> 09:52.396
in a butter churn and kept on churning.

09:52.465 --> 09:54.799
At the colonial fair,
I should have kicked you

09:54.867 --> 09:58.836
in the shins repeatedly
with a steel-tipped boot.

09:58.905 --> 10:00.271
You see, mine was better

10:00.339 --> 10:02.339
- because I used elements of the fair.
- Mm.

10:02.408 --> 10:04.942
Oh, God, I find it really refreshing

10:05.011 --> 10:06.710
to openly hate another person.

10:06.779 --> 10:08.979
Hate is a strong word,
but also accurate.

10:09.048 --> 10:10.214
I hate you.

10:10.283 --> 10:11.382
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

10:11.450 --> 10:12.583
Now, how are we going to get out

10:12.652 --> 10:14.018
of the Revolutionary War reenactment?

10:14.086 --> 10:16.253
Oh, Stan cashed in
a ton of marriage points.

10:16.322 --> 10:17.288
We call them chips.

10:17.356 --> 10:18.455
Uh-huh.

10:18.524 --> 10:19.690
We inherited my late mother's bunnies,

10:19.759 --> 10:21.592
so I pretty much have to go.

10:21.661 --> 10:24.628
The thought of being with you on
a road trip makes me want to kill myself.

10:24.697 --> 10:26.030
You're probably one of those women

10:26.098 --> 10:27.865
that does a lot
of shoulder-dancing in the car.

10:27.934 --> 10:29.700
Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I pump fists, too.

10:29.769 --> 10:31.168
Oh, God, I already feel sick.

10:31.237 --> 10:32.536
- You know what?
- What?

10:32.605 --> 10:34.238
We should show our husbands this.

10:34.307 --> 10:36.140
- What do you mean?
- Our relationship.

10:36.209 --> 10:37.975
If we show Greg and Stan how awful it is

10:38.044 --> 10:39.643
to be around us when we're together,

10:39.712 --> 10:41.545
they will never ask us
to double date again.

10:41.614 --> 10:42.880
I like that.

10:42.949 --> 10:44.815
- Yes.
- Not you. I hate you.

10:44.884 --> 10:46.217
Back at you.

10:46.285 --> 10:47.885
Bon appétit.

10:47.954 --> 10:48.919
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah!

10:48.988 --> 10:50.020
Boom.

10:51.157 --> 10:52.857
I did that.

10:52.925 --> 10:55.192
Enjoy your eggs.

11:00.166 --> 11:02.566
Thanks so much for inviting
Stan and Chloe over for dinner.

11:02.635 --> 11:04.368
I really appreciate you
making the effort.

11:04.437 --> 11:05.569
Hey, it's a marriage.

11:05.638 --> 11:07.338
We guilt each other into doing things.

11:11.177 --> 11:12.476
Good evening, sir.

11:12.545 --> 11:14.411
No, good evening to you, sir.

11:14.480 --> 11:15.579
We brought wine.

11:15.648 --> 11:19.049
Ah, yes, this is a very special bottle

11:19.118 --> 11:21.966
commemorating my heritage
as a Mayflower descendant.

11:22.028 --> 11:24.154
- Oh.
- Did you know that the Mayflower

11:24.223 --> 11:25.589
was originally a wine transport?

11:25.658 --> 11:28.225
I did, but it's still fascinating.
Please, go on.

11:28.294 --> 11:30.828
Well, it was originally
a wine transport,

11:30.897 --> 11:33.998
- and that's all that I have.
- Oh.

11:34.066 --> 11:35.232
Come on, Chloe.

11:35.301 --> 11:37.101
Let's open this bottle
and let it breathe.

11:39.438 --> 11:42.640
Okay, this just got
real boring real fast.

11:42.708 --> 11:43.974
We need to end it quick.

11:44.043 --> 11:46.510
Hey, Katie, it's so great
to finally see your place.

11:46.579 --> 11:49.313
I've always wondered what
the tiny-house craze was about.

11:49.382 --> 11:50.981
You know what
I've always wondered, Chloe?

11:51.050 --> 11:52.336
What's that?

11:52.361 --> 11:54.118
Do the thousands of likes
you get on your Instagram

11:54.186 --> 11:56.453
make up for the zero likes
you get in real life?

11:56.522 --> 11:57.588
Do you have a cat

11:57.657 --> 11:59.790
or just a candle that smells like urine?

11:59.859 --> 12:01.125
Tell me your secret...

12:01.193 --> 12:03.227
how do you keep your face
looking so old?

12:04.730 --> 12:06.697
- They're looking.
- Okay, let's put this thing to bed.

12:06.766 --> 12:07.798
Give me a little shove.

12:07.867 --> 12:09.533
- Good idea.
- Okay. Ah!

12:10.870 --> 12:12.002
What the hell was that?!

12:12.071 --> 12:13.304
I didn't know you were gonna go flying.

12:13.372 --> 12:14.638
What are you made of, hollow bones?

12:14.707 --> 12:17.274
That bottle was irreplaceable.

12:17.343 --> 12:19.243
But to be fair,
we were just about to drink it,

12:19.312 --> 12:20.846
so it would have been gone anyway.

12:20.932 --> 12:22.580
It's kind of funny when you
think about it that way.

12:22.643 --> 12:24.615
Funny? That bottle
represented the Mayflower

12:24.684 --> 12:26.450
and everything
its passengers accomplished.

12:26.519 --> 12:27.985
The Mayflower is important,

12:28.054 --> 12:29.753
but its historical significance
has always been overstated.

12:29.822 --> 12:32.356
Have you gone mad, sir?

12:32.425 --> 12:35.125
The Susan Constant, Discovery, and
Godspeed all predate the Mayflower.

12:35.196 --> 12:36.160
Yes, but you must agree,

12:36.228 --> 12:38.595
without the Mayflower,
America never would have formed.

12:38.664 --> 12:40.431
Now I ask you, sir... have you gone mad?

12:40.499 --> 12:41.966
Let's remember our place here, Gregory.

12:42.034 --> 12:44.101
You are a junior member
at the Historical Guild.

12:44.170 --> 12:45.536
Yes, but I only joined a few months ago.

12:45.604 --> 12:46.770
You've been there for five years,

12:46.839 --> 12:48.272
and you're still just
the recording secretary.

12:49.408 --> 12:51.475
That was a low blow, sir. Good day!

12:51.544 --> 12:53.644
Good day to you, sir!

12:53.713 --> 12:55.679
No, I am the one that says good day!

12:58.317 --> 12:59.751
Shouldn't we do something?

12:59.776 --> 13:01.634
I don't want Greg and Stan
not to be friends.

13:01.712 --> 13:04.212
No, who cares? As long as we never
get to see each other again.

13:09.495 --> 13:12.429
Babe, you okay?

13:12.498 --> 13:14.198
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

13:14.266 --> 13:16.567
I'm completely and totally fine.

13:16.635 --> 13:18.993
<i>Crap. Greg's sad,
and there's wine everywhere.</i>

13:19.071 --> 13:20.571
<i>Should I ask him to help clean up?</i>

13:20.639 --> 13:22.206
<i>I mean, it would be a lot faster.</i>

13:22.274 --> 13:23.240
Hey, Greg.

13:25.845 --> 13:27.378
I love you.

13:29.148 --> 13:32.483
<i>Good hold, Katie, good hold.</i>

13:39.511 --> 13:42.612
<i>Greg only does puzzles
when he's super depressed.</i>

13:42.681 --> 13:45.200
<i>That piece is obviously
part of the horse's hoof.</i>

13:45.317 --> 13:46.917
<i>Come on, man!</i>

13:46.985 --> 13:49.219
Need some help?

13:49.288 --> 13:50.720
Sure.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.856
You were right.

13:52.925 --> 13:54.624
They really are
stupid Chloe Brown Mueller

13:54.693 --> 13:56.793
and stupid Stan Lawton.

13:56.862 --> 13:59.029
I'm sorry that you and Stan
got in a fight.

13:59.097 --> 14:00.263
It's okay.

14:00.332 --> 14:01.565
It just sucks because Stan
is the first guy

14:01.633 --> 14:03.166
I really connected with in Westport.

14:03.235 --> 14:05.302
Everyone else works in finance.

14:05.370 --> 14:07.103
Whenever I say I'm a history professor,

14:07.172 --> 14:08.905
they say, "Oh, that's so cool.

14:08.974 --> 14:11.508
I just spent $3,000
on a ticket for 'Hamilton.'"

14:14.947 --> 14:16.146
And to make matters worse,

14:16.214 --> 14:18.048
Stan just kicked me out
of the Historical Guild.

14:18.116 --> 14:20.617
Oh, babe. I am so sorry.

14:20.686 --> 14:21.985
It's okay.

14:22.054 --> 14:24.321
Maybe I'll just join the
Westport bird-watching society

14:24.389 --> 14:25.822
and make new friends.

14:25.891 --> 14:28.224
Oh, who am I kidding?
They'll never take me.

14:34.299 --> 14:36.700
If I would have just been a good wife,

14:36.768 --> 14:38.602
my husband would have still
had his boyfriend.

14:38.670 --> 14:42.372
For some reason, hearing that Greg
is depressed really bums me out.

14:42.441 --> 14:43.440
Me, too.

14:43.508 --> 14:44.908
It's like hearing a puppy died.

14:44.977 --> 14:46.209
Or that that panda at the zoo

14:46.278 --> 14:48.144
doesn't want to have sex
with the other panda.

14:48.213 --> 14:49.579
You and Chloe drove them apart.

14:49.648 --> 14:51.281
It's your responsibility
to put them back together.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.649
Mm-hmm. You should go talk to her.

14:52.718 --> 14:54.551
- You should shut your face.
- Uh...

14:54.620 --> 14:56.753
Sorry, she just really riles me up.

14:56.822 --> 14:58.788
I'm not going to Chloe for help.

14:58.857 --> 15:01.722
She'll just be all smug
and have me grovel and beg.

15:01.792 --> 15:03.237
And then she will enjoy
every minute of it.

15:03.300 --> 15:04.526
You don't know that.

15:04.597 --> 15:06.162
Sure I do because
if it was the other way around,

15:06.231 --> 15:08.798
I would be so mean
and it would be so much fun.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.467
Just suck it up and get it done.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.635
Fine.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.269
I'll go talk to Chloe.

15:13.338 --> 15:14.771
Yeah, 'cause Greg's a saint.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.006
I'd marry him if I had the chance.

15:16.875 --> 15:17.974
You heard me.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.442
He always smells like toffee.

15:19.511 --> 15:21.378
Stay away from my husband.

15:27.953 --> 15:29.853
How'd it go at recess today?

15:29.921 --> 15:31.087
Great.

15:31.156 --> 15:33.156
I asked this boy
if I could play with his ball.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.558
He said no,
so I punched him in the nose.

15:35.627 --> 15:37.360
He ran away, and I took it.

15:37.429 --> 15:38.828
Oh, crap.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.196
All the other kids saw,

15:40.265 --> 15:42.465
so now I just take whatever toys I want.

15:42.534 --> 15:43.767
Isn't it awesome?

15:43.835 --> 15:44.901
No!

15:44.970 --> 15:46.302
This is not awesome.

15:46.371 --> 15:47.871
You're going to get in trouble.

15:47.939 --> 15:50.173
No way. I run that playground.

15:50.242 --> 15:52.747
Going around punching
whoever you want is bad.

15:52.872 --> 15:55.378
No, it's not. I punched Oliver
and got my seat back.

15:55.447 --> 15:58.248
I punched a kid at school,
and now I have new toys.

15:58.316 --> 16:00.617
And I get to cut in line
at the tire swing.

16:00.686 --> 16:02.385
Punching people works.

16:02.454 --> 16:03.953
Just like you taught me.

16:04.022 --> 16:07.390
Anna-Kat, promise me you'll
please stop punching people.

16:09.528 --> 16:10.994
Nah.

16:12.097 --> 16:15.365
Okay, promise me you won't
tell Mom any of this happened.

16:15.434 --> 16:17.133
I'll do what I want to do!

16:25.544 --> 16:28.011
Katie!

16:28.080 --> 16:31.014
You're trespassing.

16:31.083 --> 16:32.549
I only need five minutes.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.050
Can we talk inside?

16:34.119 --> 16:35.919
You know what? It is such a nice day,

16:35.987 --> 16:37.520
why don't we chat on the patio?

16:37.589 --> 16:39.622
Come on.

16:42.294 --> 16:45.428
Katie, these are my Adirondack chairs.

16:45.497 --> 16:47.397
Adirondack chairs, you remember Katie.

16:47.466 --> 16:49.566
<i>Come on, Katie. Do this for Greg.</i>

16:49.634 --> 16:51.000
<i>Without him,</i>

16:51.069 --> 16:53.670
<i>you wouldn't have Anna-Kat
or those other two kids.</i>

16:53.739 --> 16:55.972
So what is it you wanted to discuss?

16:56.041 --> 17:00.310
I came here to ask for your help.

17:00.378 --> 17:01.978
Appearance, manners, parenting?

17:02.047 --> 17:03.580
What are we talking about here?

17:03.648 --> 17:04.781
- For you hair?
- No.

17:04.849 --> 17:07.450
My husband is miserable
without your husband,

17:07.519 --> 17:09.419
and I need you to convince Stan

17:09.488 --> 17:11.320
to become friends with him again.

17:11.388 --> 17:12.555
Please.

17:12.624 --> 17:14.824
Consider it done.

17:14.893 --> 17:15.858
Seriously?

17:15.926 --> 17:17.093
Of course.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.728
It's no skin off my back.
Why wouldn't I help?

17:18.797 --> 17:21.396
Well, thank you, Chloe.

17:21.465 --> 17:23.266
I thought this was gonna be,
like, a whole...

17:23.335 --> 17:24.601
I just need you
to answer one question, though.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.301
There she is.

17:26.371 --> 17:27.637
Did I steal these chairs

17:27.705 --> 17:29.205
or did I get them fair and square?

17:29.274 --> 17:30.306
Excuse me?

17:30.375 --> 17:33.476
Did I steal these chairs

17:33.545 --> 17:38.181
or did I get them fair and square?

17:38.250 --> 17:41.484
The truth is...

17:41.553 --> 17:42.986
you stole them!

17:43.054 --> 17:44.888
You're nothing but a damn chair thief.

17:44.956 --> 17:46.055
So fun chatting with you.

17:46.124 --> 17:47.590
Say hello to your sad husband for me.

17:47.659 --> 17:49.626
Chloe, wait.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.795
You're not a chair thief.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.664
You got these chairs fair and square.

17:54.733 --> 17:56.099
There, you happy?

17:56.168 --> 17:58.067
- Now on film.
- What?

17:58.136 --> 17:59.502
Well, you slandered me on the Internet,

17:59.571 --> 18:00.837
the least you can do is correct it.

18:00.992 --> 18:02.424
Okay, well, then,
let's just get this over with.

18:02.528 --> 18:03.773
- Great.
- Okay?

18:03.842 --> 18:05.508
So, um... Hey, Internet.

18:05.577 --> 18:08.278
Wait, could you start it with,
"What's up, my Chlo-riders?

18:08.346 --> 18:09.512
It's me... Katie."

18:10.615 --> 18:13.016
What's up, my Chlo-riders?

18:13.084 --> 18:14.584
It's me... Katie.

18:14.653 --> 18:17.387
Could you just give me
a little more smile in the eyes?

18:21.326 --> 18:22.659
Hey, Greg,

18:22.727 --> 18:26.196
isn't today the anniversary
of the Battle of Ridgefield?

18:26.264 --> 18:27.330
Yes.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.999
Well, you should get dressed for battle.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.801
Your ride just showed up.

18:31.870 --> 18:33.570
What are you talking about?

18:38.476 --> 18:39.442
Lieutenant Otto,

18:39.511 --> 18:41.611
700 British are advancing on the town.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.614
General Wooster needs
his officers on the battlefield.

18:44.683 --> 18:46.549
Shall we kill some redcoats, sir?

18:46.618 --> 18:47.717
If I die this day,

18:47.786 --> 18:50.019
let it be known that I died for freedom!

18:50.088 --> 18:51.354
I'm gonna go change.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.922
I'll be right back.

18:52.991 --> 18:54.691
Actually, I'm gonna wait by the car.

18:54.759 --> 18:55.625
- Okay!
- Hi, Katie.

18:55.694 --> 18:57.694
Hi.

19:03.702 --> 19:05.201
Ooh! Oh.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.437
- Greg?
- I'm fine, I'm fine, yeah.

19:13.078 --> 19:16.880
Thanks for convincing Stan
to take Greg back.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.314
No thanks necessary.

19:18.383 --> 19:20.049
I literally did nothing.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.118
Stan was miserable without Greg, too.

19:22.187 --> 19:23.486
And when you came to the house,

19:23.555 --> 19:25.054
he'd already decided to reach out.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.756
So all those things that I said...

19:26.825 --> 19:28.291
Didn't have to do any of it.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.560
Well, that is just so funny.

19:30.629 --> 19:34.197
But, Katie, for real,
you have a lovely lawn.

19:34.266 --> 19:37.400
Only thing missing... Adirondack chairs.

19:38.904 --> 19:40.536
I'll see you around, Kit-Kat.

19:41.706 --> 19:42.939
<i>And the worst part is</i>

19:43.008 --> 19:44.908
<i>I didn't tell Greg
that I groveled for him,</i>

19:44.976 --> 19:46.843
<i>so I didn't even get the marital chips.</i>

19:46.912 --> 19:49.145
<i>Being a halfway-decent wife sucks.</i>

19:53.601 --> 19:54.700
And the best part is

19:54.809 --> 19:56.946
these chairs once belonged
to Paul Newman.

19:57.110 --> 19:58.142
Kids, that's not true.

19:58.211 --> 19:59.277
You wouldn't know about it, Greg.

19:59.346 --> 20:01.479
His time in these chairs
was very private.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.781
How'd you convince Chloe
to give you the chairs anyway?

20:03.850 --> 20:05.450
Ooh, let's hurry this up.

20:05.518 --> 20:07.018
You two get caught stealing,
slap on the wrist.

20:07.087 --> 20:09.454
I just get seen in someone's
backyard, I get shot.

20:09.522 --> 20:10.788
I just asked.

20:10.857 --> 20:13.124
And she could not
have been more gracious.

20:13.193 --> 20:14.258
Oh.

20:28.234 --> 20:29.691
That bitch!

20:29.828 --> 20:32.076
Oh, that dirty little bitch!

20:32.145 --> 20:34.912
I'm gonna take those chairs
and run them right up her ass!

20:34.981 --> 20:39.350
No!!

20:39.419 --> 20:41.152
My chairs!

20:41.400 --> 20:43.905
My beautiful chairs!

20:47.131 --> 20:48.531
Move.

20:54.516 --> 20:56.399
Whatever happened
between the two of you,

20:56.601 --> 20:58.000
I love it.
