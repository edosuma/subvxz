04:45.535 --> 04:48.121

05:18.026 --> 05:19.235

05:19.319 --> 05:22.071

I can explain it to you

05:22.155 --> 05:25.575

that you will understand.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.909

You see, what feels like
a long, long, long time ago,

05:32.582 --> 05:35.543

was just a year ago,

05:35.543 --> 05:39.756

10:38.763 --> 10:40.556
and you turned out
perfect--

10:40.640 --> 10:41.557
Never mind.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.937
So,
storm keeping you up, too.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.230
I look like
a 5-year-old to you?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.941
I'm not gonna let some --

10:51.025 --> 10:53.486
Okay. Fine.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.404
Maybe the storm
is keeping me up a little bit.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.531
I ain't exactly been sleeping
a whole lot, anyway.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.116
Ah, you and me both.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.577
Seems like every time
I turn on the news,

11:01.661 --> 11:02.828
it's something else.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.080
You are not wrong, son.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.626
Crazy has always existed. Mm.

11:08.626 --> 11:09.752
But now?

11:09.752 --> 11:11.921
Ooh, it's different now.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.964
I remember growing up,
how scared I used to be,

11:14.048 --> 11:15.257
seeing pictures
in the papers

11:15.341 --> 11:17.259
of the Klan marching around
with their hoods on.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.346
But hell,
at least those cowards

11:20.346 --> 11:22.390
were too scared
to show their faces.

11:22.390 --> 11:26.435
Now, these bigots
are marching around here

11:26.519 --> 11:27.812
with their own
camera crews...

11:27.812 --> 11:29.188
Man: White power!

11:30.523 --> 11:32.400
...dressed up
in trucker's caps

11:32.400 --> 11:34.235
and khakis
and button-down shirts.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.277
Mm.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.863
Their fashion game
stays in shambles.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.116
Yeah,
they never were too sharp.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.451
When did they decide
to become so bold?

11:42.535 --> 11:43.828
Pops, I'm telling you,

11:43.828 --> 11:46.080
with politics
the way they are now,

11:46.080 --> 11:48.040
t-t-they've found
a sales pitch

11:48.124 --> 11:49.875
that's resonating
with people that --

11:49.959 --> 11:52.878
that aren't your average
card-carrying Klan members.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.463
Sales pitch?

11:54.547 --> 11:55.881
White pride.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.801
Oh, it's nothing at all for --
for a black man to say

11:58.801 --> 12:00.761
that he's black
and proud of it.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.638
It's nothing
for a Mexican to say

12:02.722 --> 12:05.558
that they're Chicano and --
and proud of it.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.478
Why is it that people
are ashamed to say

12:09.562 --> 12:10.521
that they're white?

12:10.521 --> 12:12.189
Well, I'm not ashamed
to say it.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.109
I'm a proud white man.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.318
What?

12:16.402 --> 12:17.820
White pride is not like
a real thing.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.863
Tell him.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.906
Pops,
who are we to tell people

12:20.990 --> 12:23.826
that they can't have pride
in their heritage, huh?

12:23.826 --> 12:25.411
Black people
love their pride.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.204
Hell, we got a whole song
about it.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.706
Oh.

12:28.706 --> 12:29.582
The hell
are you talking about?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.083
Hey, I'm just saying.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.501
Oh, what's up, baby?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.628
♪ I'm black and I'm proud ♪
Ow!

12:34.712 --> 12:36.672
See, when J.B. made
"Say It Loud",

12:36.756 --> 12:39.008
it wasn't just some
hip, new song.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.511
It was a -- an affirmation
of self-respect.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.098
See, self-respect
for a whole lot of people

12:46.182 --> 12:48.225
who weren't getting a whole lot
of love anywhere else.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.853
It was an anthem
of the civil rights era.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.563
You have to understand, son.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.607
People were antsy
all over the country

12:54.607 --> 12:55.983
during that time.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.943
Didn't nobody know
what to do.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.862
Martin Luther King
had just been assassinated,

12:59.862 --> 13:01.530
the Vietnam War
was raging,

13:01.614 --> 13:04.116
it was hard enough
just trying to get a job.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.410
The people needed
to hear something

13:06.494 --> 13:08.078
that was going
to give them hope,

13:08.162 --> 13:09.705
and James Brown said it.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.875
"Say it loud,
I'm black and I'm proud."

13:12.875 --> 13:14.710
It was lyrical emancipation.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.254
♪ I'm black and I'm proud ♪
Ha!

13:17.338 --> 13:18.506
♪ Say it loud ♪

13:18.506 --> 13:19.548
♪ I'm black and I'm proud ♪

13:19.632 --> 13:20.758
♪ Lordy, lordy, lordy ♪

13:20.758 --> 13:21.884
♪ Say it loud ♪

13:21.884 --> 13:23.886
You see,
the word "pride" --

13:23.886 --> 13:27.223
it implies that you have
overcome adversity, see?

13:27.223 --> 13:29.475
So,
if you're black or brown

13:29.475 --> 13:32.895
or -- or gay or a woman
or a Clippers fan,

13:32.895 --> 13:34.396
you have endured
the struggle.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.733
We were so close
when Blake went down.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.860
Say you happen to be free,
white, and over 21?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.570
Then you haven't
experienced

13:41.654 --> 13:43.572
the kind of oppression
that we have.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.865
Good for you.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.617
You won the lottery.

13:46.617 --> 13:47.827
We get it.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.870
But you don't have to tell
people you're proud of it.

13:49.954 --> 13:50.996
Mm.
It's like saying

13:51.080 --> 13:52.998
you're proud of being
rich and beautiful.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.500
I mean, what's next?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.793
That's the thing, Pops.

13:55.793 --> 13:59.421
After eight years of having
a black President,

13:59.505 --> 14:02.758
a lot of these people do feel
they've overcome adversity.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.637
Well, if black folks making
that one little step forward

14:06.637 --> 14:08.931
is enough to lead
our entire country

14:08.931 --> 14:10.099
this far back --

14:10.099 --> 14:11.684
--

14:11.684 --> 14:13.519
we in a hell of
a lot of trouble.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.454
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.998
It's okay.
It's okay.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.457
Here, take that.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.042
Just take that.
Mm-hmm.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.714
Dad.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.800
Dammit, Junior.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.010
I'm sorry.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.970
It's just...
I can't sleep.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.054
Oh.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.140
Of course you'd be afraid
of the storm.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.309
Storm?
What storm?

14:53.309 --> 14:55.352
Oh, God, take my father!

15:00.149 --> 15:01.358
Okay. Fine.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.152
Maybe I'm slightly bothered
by the weather,

15:03.152 --> 15:06.322
but that's not
why I can't sleep.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.323
I've got this thing

15:07.323 --> 15:08.908
I'm dealing with
at school tomorrow

15:08.908 --> 15:09.992
with student council.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.161
The school wants to suspend
any athletes

15:12.161 --> 15:14.496
who take a knee
during the National Anthem.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.165
That is ridiculous.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.167
And you're filled
with fury and rage.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.377
That's why you can't
fall asleep, right?

15:20.461 --> 15:21.837
Well, actually --

15:21.921 --> 15:24.840
I don't even know
why I get my hopes up.

15:24.924 --> 15:29.261
Look, son, black athletes
using their platform

15:29.345 --> 15:31.013
to fight social injustice

15:31.013 --> 15:33.390
did not start
with Colin Kaepernick.

15:33.474 --> 15:40.356
♪ I'm just a soul
whose intentions are good ♪

15:40.356 --> 15:42.316
♪ Oh, Lord, please don't
let me be misunderstood ♪

15:42.316 --> 15:46.320
Muhammad Ali went to jail,
lost his title,

15:46.320 --> 15:49.698
and almost went broke
protesting the Vietnam War.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.908
Arthur Ashe,

15:50.908 --> 15:52.993
arrested on
two different occasions

15:53.077 --> 15:54.870
fighting
for human rights.

15:54.954 --> 15:59.249
Tommie Smith, John Carlos
got blackballed

15:59.333 --> 16:01.710
for taking the biggest moment
in their lives

16:01.794 --> 16:04.713
and making it into something
bigger than them.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.299
These men took careers

16:07.383 --> 16:09.760
that they've trained and worked
their whole lives for

16:09.760 --> 16:12.221
and put them on the line
for us.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.223
Does that mean
anything to you?

16:14.223 --> 16:15.224
Of course it does.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.893
But...honestly, Dad,

16:17.977 --> 16:21.063
I'm just not sure I agree
with the kneeling thing.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.815
I don't even know
what good it does,

16:22.815 --> 16:25.818
especially when people say
that it offends the troops.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.444
I mean, they put
their lives on the line

16:27.528 --> 16:29.363
every day
for our country.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.572
Oh, my God, son.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.282
This is not
about the troops.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.410
It's about
police brutality.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.079
Dad, I know all of
the different arguments.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.122
Trust me.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.498
It's all
I've been thinking about.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.668
So, you're gonna side
with the administration?

16:42.668 --> 16:45.129
Actually, I'm not.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.676
Even though I'm not sure
I agree with what they're doing,

16:50.676 --> 16:52.886
I do know
that they have a right

16:52.970 --> 16:55.764
to peacefully protest
for their ideas.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.768
If I represent students,

16:59.852 --> 17:02.271
isn't it my job
to defend their rights?

17:08.277 --> 17:11.530
So, can I --
can I sleep in here?

17:11.530 --> 17:13.949
Yeah.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.868
Yeah, go ahead, man.
Take my side of the bed.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.294
Hey.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.305
Hey, buddy.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.766
I know it's scary out there,

17:38.766 --> 17:41.143
but you have
a lot of family,

17:41.143 --> 17:43.187
and I just want
to let you know

17:43.187 --> 17:46.315
I'm the only one
that loves you.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.650
So, man, you're gonna have
to stop messing around

17:48.734 --> 17:50.486
and go to sleep.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.738
Please.

17:52.738 --> 17:56.492
There you go.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.409
Dad! Dad!

17:58.327 --> 17:59.912
I mean, sorry. Stop.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.663
Shoot.

18:01.747 --> 18:02.998
What?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.333
I just got him down.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.085
Are you trying to make that
our problem?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.211
Yeah.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.754
Do you want us to resent
our little brother?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.798
Fine. Whatever.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.007
What's up?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.884
Can't sleep.
Dre: Oh.

18:13.884 --> 18:17.513
Let me guess --
you're afraid of race riots,

18:17.513 --> 18:20.808
of the opioid crisis
or --

18:20.808 --> 18:23.268
oh, here's a good one --
North Korea.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.895
North Korea?

18:24.895 --> 18:26.688
Why would we be
afraid of them?

18:26.772 --> 18:28.941
Oh...you shouldn't be.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.110
Alright,
so...what's up?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.361
We're afraid
of the storm.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.571
And I'm pretty sure
once I get to Google,

18:34.655 --> 18:36.698
I'm also going to be afraid
of North Korea.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.369
It feels like God
is just being extra.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.370
Okay.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.081
Hey, guys, relax.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.959
Storms are loud,
and they pass.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.710
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.129
It's okay.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.421
That's not the problem.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.132
Or actually true.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.551
Have you seen what storms
have been doing recently?

18:55.551 --> 18:57.928
There was Hurricane Harvey
in Texas,

18:57.928 --> 19:01.890
and Irma, and Maria,
and Jose.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.476
There was a hurricane
every week in September.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.103
That's not normal.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.981
I saw on YouTube this guy,
Al Gore,

19:08.981 --> 19:10.858
predicted more storms
were going to happen

19:10.858 --> 19:12.401
10 years ago.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.069
Why didn't you guys
elect him?

19:14.153 --> 19:18.073
Well, to be fair,
he did win the popular vote.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.283
Instead,
you elected a guy

19:19.283 --> 19:21.577
who doesn't seem to care
about climate change.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.705
The United States
will withdraw...

19:26.707 --> 19:31.795
...from
the Paris Climate Accord.

19:31.879 --> 19:35.174
Well, to be fair,
he <i>didn't</i> win the popular vote.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.594
Hey, guys, I don't know
what to say, alright?

19:38.594 --> 19:40.095
Look, Father,

19:40.179 --> 19:42.556
we know you're not gonna be
able to take care of this.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.183
Huh?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.601
You sweat
when you chew gum.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.269
You wear a different belt
when you drive.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.688
I've seen you quit
halfway up the stairs.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.398
I got bunions.

19:51.398 --> 19:54.109
You just getting by day-to-day
means a lot to us.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.527
Really does.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.654
And the weather stuff --
we're gonna figure it out.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.324
Yeah.
It's our future.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.034
We want to fight for it. Yeah.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.453
You just enjoy
the time you have left.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.495
Which,
at your current rate,

20:05.579 --> 20:06.997
