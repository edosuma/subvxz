WEBVTT

00:00.944 --> 00:02.910
<i>Hey, Dad, I'm gonna head out.</i>

00:03.012 --> 00:04.846
I just talked to Craig, and he's...

00:04.948 --> 00:07.381
Dad!
Oh! My God!

00:07.484 --> 00:11.085
- Don't die, don't die, Dad!
- Oh, man, you fell for it!

00:11.187 --> 00:13.821
- What?
- You got so sad!

00:13.923 --> 00:17.024
Your voice went up, like,
six octaves.

00:17.126 --> 00:18.626
You sounded like a beautiful woman.

00:18.728 --> 00:20.928
- What the hell is this?
- Alangulon, what you thought

00:21.030 --> 00:25.132
was your disemboweled father
is actually Meka-Zorn.

00:25.235 --> 00:27.869
- What? Meka-Zorn?
- My robot clone.

00:27.971 --> 00:29.537
Yeah, this is the decoy
I'd use back in Zephyria

00:29.639 --> 00:32.073
to distract my enemies,
and then sneak attack them.

00:32.174 --> 00:33.541
<i>I am Zorn.</i>

00:33.643 --> 00:35.076
Yeah, I just got him back.
You know, he was

00:35.178 --> 00:37.478
serving a prison sentence for
a, um, uh, uh, for a friend,

00:37.580 --> 00:40.081
an identical looking friend of mi...

00:40.183 --> 00:41.094
Well, you know what?
Not important.

00:41.190 --> 00:44.452
What is important
is that he's awesome, okay?

00:44.554 --> 00:45.820
Well, like, check this out.
He's also a massage chair.

00:45.922 --> 00:48.055
- Really?
- Yeah, come on, go for it.

00:48.157 --> 00:50.358
Son, you don't have to be scared, okay?
He's a massage chair.

00:50.460 --> 00:53.027
You've been to a Sharper Image before,
haven't you? Let's go.

00:53.129 --> 00:54.362
Yeah, go ahead, take a seat.

00:54.464 --> 00:57.765
Oh!
Burn! He's also a Whoopee cushion.

00:57.867 --> 01:01.536
Oh, come on!
It's still a massage chair, you know.

01:01.638 --> 01:03.771
Get on back here and
sit on your dad's robot.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.990
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0
~ Addic7ed.com ~ </font></i>

01:10.046 --> 01:12.146
<i>I know the terms of our divorce.</i>

01:12.248 --> 01:15.383
I understand what "joint custody" means.

01:15.485 --> 01:18.252
Because he's my dog, Jake!

01:18.354 --> 01:21.856
Okay, what did the counselor
say about harsh words?

01:21.958 --> 01:23.190
<i>I'm not doing this right now.</i>

01:24.294 --> 01:27.828
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.</i>

01:27.931 --> 01:29.497
Where are you going, Zorn?

01:29.599 --> 01:31.632
Oh, sorry. Yeah.
No, I-I-I'm, uh, I'm tired.

01:31.734 --> 01:33.234
And I don't feel like
being here, so, uh,

01:33.336 --> 01:36.404
- I-I might need tomorrow, too.
- Sorry. You used up all your sick days.

01:36.506 --> 01:37.738
Yeah, but I said I'm tired,

01:37.840 --> 01:40.174
- so I guess I'll just, you know...
- Everybody's tired, Zorn.

01:40.276 --> 01:43.444
You know what? Why don't you get
ready to do some real work around here?

01:43.546 --> 01:45.880
That Route Logistics
proposal no one wants to do,

01:45.982 --> 01:48.849
- starting tomorrow, it's yours.
- Hey, quick question. Am I...?

01:48.952 --> 01:51.786
Are you kidding me right now, Todd?
You want to give me lip, too?

01:51.888 --> 01:54.088
<i>Well, guess what?
You and your best friend Zorn</i>

01:54.190 --> 01:56.057
are now both on Route Logistics!

01:56.159 --> 01:58.092
<i>Todd?!
You're saddling me with Todd?</i>

01:58.194 --> 02:00.027
- Cool.
- He's the Todd of our office.

02:01.297 --> 02:03.331
<i>Oh, nice shot!</i>

02:03.433 --> 02:06.767
- I'm gonna kill you, Craig!
- Finally, something we could do together.

02:06.869 --> 02:08.369
Zorn, they're just playing video games.

02:08.471 --> 02:10.071
<i>Yeah, it's called Blood Soldiers.</i>

02:10.173 --> 02:12.607
I play mainly just to
observe human behavior.

02:12.709 --> 02:13.874
Die, die, die, die, die!

02:13.977 --> 02:15.443
That sounds stupid.
Alangulon, come on.

02:15.545 --> 02:18.238
Wouldn't you rather go on a quest
for treasure, but then discover

02:18.239 --> 02:20.932
that the real treasure is the
love between a father and his son?

02:20.933 --> 02:22.283
How's next weekend work for you?

02:22.385 --> 02:25.487
That's when they're releasing
Blood Soldiers: Subterranean Ops

02:25.488 --> 02:28.589
and Craig and I are gonna wait in
line to get limited edition copies.

02:28.691 --> 02:30.524
<i>Yeah, waiting with gamers is fun.</i>

02:30.627 --> 02:32.560
It's like a little community.
I love little communities.

02:32.662 --> 02:34.161
<i>Edie, are you just gonna</i>

02:34.263 --> 02:36.664
sit here and let nerdy-ass
Craig nerdify our son?

02:36.766 --> 02:38.833
<i>Hey, Alangulon, you like games, huh?</i>

02:38.935 --> 02:41.068
Want to play a real man's game?
Keep away.

02:41.170 --> 02:43.537
- Ha-ha!
- Zorn.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.206
- Why would you do that?
- You missed it!

02:45.308 --> 02:47.441
Alangulon's fault. He missed it!

02:47.543 --> 02:49.610
Zorn! You cannot keep
treating Craig like this.

02:49.712 --> 02:51.245
<i>No, that's okay, Edie.</i>

02:51.347 --> 02:52.813
Hey, Alan, you want to
help me fix the controller?

02:52.915 --> 02:54.749
I would love to do that, actually.

02:54.851 --> 02:56.651
Hey, I'm gonna introduce you
to another cool small community.

02:56.753 --> 02:59.487
- What's that?
- Electronic repair community.

03:01.724 --> 03:03.424
<i>Check it out.</i>

03:03.526 --> 03:06.293
I've got a route mapped out
that over the next decade

03:06.396 --> 03:08.829
could save the company... hundreds.

03:08.931 --> 03:11.950
Yeah, good for you. How about
mapping out a way for me to get my son

03:11.951 --> 03:14.969
to stop being in love with my ex-wife's
fiancé, huh... can you do that?

03:15.071 --> 03:18.506
I could try, but, uh...
Wait, what are we talking about?

03:18.608 --> 03:20.441
Yeah. I mean, it's, like,
I moved here for Alangulon,

03:20.543 --> 03:22.076
'cause, you know, I love
his awkward little ass.

03:22.178 --> 03:24.138
And I've been trying to
bond with him for months now,

03:24.139 --> 03:26.480
but who is he closer with?
Craig.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.916
Sounds like you're having
some family issues.

03:29.018 --> 03:32.853
I've been told I'm a good listener.
So...

03:37.694 --> 03:39.527
<i>And then he just
broke the controller.</i>

03:39.629 --> 03:42.831
Can you believe that? And then,
last weekend, Zorn stood in

03:42.832 --> 03:45.216
the backyard watching
Craig do his Tai Chi

03:45.217 --> 03:47.601
workout for an hour
just laughing at him.

03:47.704 --> 03:50.438
Zorn is the worst. I'm so sorry.
Oh, whoops, my napkin fell.

03:50.540 --> 03:53.375
<i>When Zorn's rude to Craig,
he's rude to me.</i>

03:53.376 --> 03:57.745
And every time he smashes
Craig's computer screen, I suffer.

03:57.847 --> 04:00.414
I get it, too.

04:00.516 --> 04:01.782
"Here she goes again"?

04:03.820 --> 04:06.287
- That's from...
- Oh, the waitress.

04:06.389 --> 04:07.988
The waitress. Here she goes again.

04:08.091 --> 04:09.824
<i>She, like, keeps walking
by and never stops.</i>

04:09.926 --> 04:11.726
Yeah, it's like, "Could
we get some pretzel bread?"

04:11.828 --> 04:13.661
They have delicious pretzel
bread here, by the way.

04:13.763 --> 04:15.896
Guys, what's going on?

04:15.998 --> 04:18.031
Okay, I'm just gonna be
really truthful with you.

04:18.134 --> 04:19.233
Yeah.

04:19.334 --> 04:21.035
Ever since Zorn moved to Orange County,

04:21.137 --> 04:23.704
all you ever do is complain about him.

04:23.806 --> 04:27.842
What?!
I talk about other things besides Zorn.

04:27.944 --> 04:29.844
We're your friends, Edie.

04:29.946 --> 04:32.513
<i>If we can't be honest
with you, who will?</i>

04:34.884 --> 04:38.252
"Want to hit up the Farmer's
Market after we ditch Edie?"

04:38.354 --> 04:39.787
Um...

04:39.889 --> 04:43.090
- Just take me off the group texts.
- Yeah, that's what I'll do.

04:44.527 --> 04:47.027
Hey, Dad.

04:47.130 --> 04:51.565
Are you home?
I got your beach chair.

04:53.536 --> 04:56.504
<i>Okay, really funny!
Good joke!</i>

04:56.606 --> 04:57.938
Wherever you're hiding,
that video game thing's

04:58.040 --> 05:01.459
not happening anymore
because it's on a Friday

05:01.460 --> 05:04.678
and I can't skip school,
so here's your chair.

05:04.781 --> 05:09.016
<i>This looks like a job for Zorn.</i>

05:09.118 --> 05:11.318
If that's Meka-Zorn, then...
Dad...

05:11.420 --> 05:13.921
Oh, man!
This time was even better.

05:14.023 --> 05:16.716
- Oh, yeah, really funny.
- Oh, my God.

05:16.867 --> 05:18.759
- You're super hilarious.
- Well, not everyone appreciates

05:18.861 --> 05:22.029
my sense of humor. It's subtle.
You know, it's very British.

05:22.131 --> 05:24.365
It sucks your Mom is being
such a nerd about the rules

05:24.467 --> 05:26.066
so you can't go do your nerd thing. Boy.

05:26.169 --> 05:28.553
Yeah, I was really looking
forward to hanging out in

05:28.554 --> 05:30.938
that line, you know, and
meet other gamers and stuff.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.275
Not that I'm a gamer, but I
just like to play the games,

05:34.377 --> 05:36.443
and hang out with other
people who play games, and...

05:36.546 --> 05:38.446
<i>Oh, you know what?
I should ask Craig</i>

05:38.447 --> 05:40.347
<i>if he can write me a note
so I can skip school.</i>

05:42.185 --> 05:44.218
<i>No, no, no, you don't...</i>

05:44.320 --> 05:46.520
No, no, no, no, no. There's
no need to ask Craig, okay?

05:46.622 --> 05:48.889
I'm your dad.
I'll let you skip school.

05:48.991 --> 05:50.724
Then I'll take you to go wait in line.

05:50.827 --> 05:52.259
You want to go wait in line with me?

05:52.361 --> 05:53.694
It's not gonna be like
a quest, or anything.

05:53.796 --> 05:56.530
- It'll be like a quest!
- Don't you have to work?

05:58.334 --> 05:59.967
<i>Okay. So that's the phone.</i>

06:00.069 --> 06:02.970
This is a computer, uh, oh!
Over there's the copy machine.

06:03.072 --> 06:04.972
And, uh, I think that's it.
I think that's all the things

06:05.074 --> 06:06.807
a robot can have sex with, right?
Yeah, all right.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.042
I'm out of here.
Have fun, buddy.

06:09.541 --> 06:13.418
Ha-ha! The quest to find
the front of the line begins.

06:13.453 --> 06:16.087
Fear not, for I have provided
everything we could possibly need.

06:16.122 --> 06:18.923
- You got water and sunblock and stuff?
- Water? No, come on.

06:18.959 --> 06:20.925
A warrior's thirst can only
be quenched with victory.

06:21.161 --> 06:24.328
Good call on the sunblock, though.
I should've brought some of that.

06:24.364 --> 06:26.063
You know, but I did bring
an invisibility cloak.

06:26.099 --> 06:28.833
Great, well, that's gone forever.

06:28.868 --> 06:30.802
You know, the first 100 people
will get the limited edition.

06:30.837 --> 06:33.571
Which means we need
more intel.

06:35.375 --> 06:37.775
Come on!
I hate that bird.

06:37.811 --> 06:39.510
Tell me, Clawthor, the Taloned One,

06:39.546 --> 06:41.412
what valuable information
have you gathered from the sky?

06:42.816 --> 06:44.849
He assures me that we are 35th in line.

06:44.884 --> 06:47.084
And there's an obese gentleman
on some sort of scooter device.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.821
I'm pretty sure we're,
like, at least 10th.

06:49.856 --> 06:51.689
Oh, this bird is drunk as hell.

06:51.724 --> 06:54.058
<i>Hey, man.
Cool General Steel mask.</i>

06:54.093 --> 06:55.460
Oh, yeah, you like it?

06:55.495 --> 06:57.028
<i>"The perimeter has been breached."</i>

06:57.063 --> 06:58.396
Hey, man, do you mind
holding my spot in line?

06:58.431 --> 06:59.931
I want to hit up the taco truck.

06:59.966 --> 07:01.232
<i>Oh, yeah, go for it.</i>

07:01.267 --> 07:02.500
<i>- Hey, let me know if they got
- All right.</i>

07:02.535 --> 07:05.570
<i>any of that pico de gallo,
'cause I'm a PDG freak.</i>

07:05.605 --> 07:08.739
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.
- Awesome. Thank you.

07:08.775 --> 07:10.475
Ha-ha! Victory!

07:10.510 --> 07:12.777
The first step of the quest is done.

07:12.812 --> 07:14.979
You know, usually, that's
killing the village children,

07:15.014 --> 07:16.681
but this feels good, too.

07:19.285 --> 07:21.719
<i>I don't want to be that guy,</i>

07:21.754 --> 07:25.122
but do you think you could at
least try and help me out here?

07:25.158 --> 07:26.924
<i>- I am Zorn!
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

07:26.960 --> 07:28.726
You're Zorn, big and powerful.

07:28.761 --> 07:31.195
I'm just lowly Todd.
Why help me?

07:31.231 --> 07:33.531
<i>Nobody can defeat the mighty Zorn!</i>

07:33.566 --> 07:35.700
I'm not trying to defeat you.

07:35.735 --> 07:38.169
I'm just trying to do
my job and live my life.

07:38.204 --> 07:41.205
But between you, Linda, my ex-wife,

07:41.241 --> 07:46.577
and my-my overbearing father,
sometimes, I just want to scream!

07:46.613 --> 07:49.614
<i>- See you in Hell, Vulchazor!
- Exactly!</i>

07:49.649 --> 07:51.782
Tell 'em all to go right to...

07:51.818 --> 07:55.920
I know what you're doing.
You want me to open up,

07:55.955 --> 07:58.289
and then you're gonna make
fun of me later. Well...

07:58.324 --> 08:00.024
<i>I am sorry you feel that way.</i>

08:00.059 --> 08:03.461
<i>Tell me more. Nobody is
planning a sneak attack. </i>

08:03.496 --> 08:05.630
Ah, I'm sorry, Zorn.

08:05.665 --> 08:08.299
I guess you just remind
me of my father.

08:08.334 --> 08:11.502
You know, it's nice, you
listening to me for a change.

08:11.538 --> 08:13.938
It's kind of weird, but nice.

08:13.973 --> 08:16.941
Tell you what. How about
I go get more tacks,

08:16.976 --> 08:18.643
you get us some coffee,

08:18.678 --> 08:21.312
and when you come back,
we'll start fresh?

08:21.347 --> 08:22.613
<i>I am Zorn!</i>

08:22.649 --> 08:26.684
And... I am Todd.
And today, that's starting to feel okay.

08:29.422 --> 08:31.289
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

08:31.324 --> 08:35.226
- Zorn cracked my screen again.
- Damn it, Zorn!

08:35.260 --> 08:38.929
You know what?
No, I'm done.

08:38.965 --> 08:40.831
- I have nothing more to say.
- What?!

08:40.866 --> 08:44.902
- Edie, you are being weird.
- I'm not complaining about Zorn anymore.

08:44.938 --> 08:47.772
- Vicky and Bridget told me that's all I ever do.
- Like we don't sit

08:47.807 --> 08:50.508
and listen to Bridget complain
about her bulimic sister?

08:50.543 --> 08:52.143
<i>It's, like,
"Okay, yeah, I'm a psychologist,</i>

08:52.178 --> 08:54.679
- but we're here to bowl."
- Well, maybe they're right.

08:54.714 --> 08:57.515
I mean, I've got lots of
non-Zorn things going on.

08:57.550 --> 09:00.156
- Why am I not talking about them?
- Well, you know,

09:00.191 --> 09:01.852
you should be
able to vent to your friends.

09:01.888 --> 09:03.688
- That's what friends do.
- Yeah.

09:03.723 --> 09:04.755
Oh, you know what?
It's working.

09:04.791 --> 09:07.858
- Oh. - Why did Zorn take
so many pictures of himself?

09:07.894 --> 09:09.694
Ugh! Oh, my God.

09:09.729 --> 09:12.997
I got to throw my
toothbrush in the garbage.

09:16.469 --> 09:17.734
Zorn, you're spilling.

09:17.792 --> 09:21.038
<i>I am Zo-Zo-Zo-Zo-Zo
Zo-Zo-Zo-Zo-Zo-Zo...</i>

09:21.074 --> 09:23.774
Oh, my God. Uh...

09:23.810 --> 09:26.210
Uh...

09:27.380 --> 09:31.782
Hi. I got a call.
I guess I'm Zorn's emergency contact.

09:31.818 --> 09:33.851
- I'm his ex-wife.
- Oh, thank God.

09:33.886 --> 09:35.486
Hi. I'm Linda, his boss.

09:35.521 --> 09:37.688
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh. Zorn said his boss was a man.

09:37.724 --> 09:39.156
Yeah. He thinks I'm a man.

09:39.192 --> 09:42.360
- It's just easier not to correct him.
- Uh-huh.

09:42.395 --> 09:44.295
<i>Okay.</i>

09:44.330 --> 09:47.832
See?
I think he may be having a seizure.

09:47.867 --> 09:50.234
Or maybe it's, like, some
Zephyrian meditation thing?

09:50.269 --> 09:52.436
- I don't know...
- No, I know what it is.

09:52.472 --> 09:56.707
This isn't Zorn. This is his
piece-of-junk robot decoy.

09:56.743 --> 10:00.177
- What?
- Yeah. Hold on.

10:03.149 --> 10:06.484
- This looks like a job for Zorn.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

10:06.519 --> 10:08.720
No, I get it. He doesn't
want to work with the lamest guy

10:08.721 --> 10:10.921
in the office, so he
brings his robot decoy.

10:10.957 --> 10:15.760
Well, that's just like him.
Take the easy way out, 'cause he's...

10:15.795 --> 10:18.095
You know what?

10:18.131 --> 10:21.132
I mean, it's not so bad.
Who are we to judge?

10:21.167 --> 10:24.235
Well, I'm his boss.
That's who I am to judge.

10:24.270 --> 10:28.406
I'm just so sick of his crap attitude.
I mean, you must be, too, right?

10:28.441 --> 10:34.145
No. I don't have "any"
complaints with Zorn.

10:34.180 --> 10:37.348
My life is so great.
I'm a mom.

10:37.383 --> 10:41.452
And that's very joyful, and I've got
a party planning business.

10:41.487 --> 10:44.422
And people say, "Edie, you're fun.
You're a fun lady."

10:44.457 --> 10:46.390
You need a drink.

10:47.827 --> 10:49.827
Yes.

10:49.862 --> 10:51.028
I got you covered, Jared, okay?
I got you covered like...

10:51.064 --> 10:51.962
<i>Boom!</i>

10:51.998 --> 10:53.497
- And boom and boom!
- What?

10:53.533 --> 10:55.032
- Hey, who's killing us?
<i>- And you're gone.</i>

10:55.068 --> 10:56.133
- Pew! Pew! Pew!
- Why is this happening?

10:56.169 --> 10:58.069
Oh, got 'em all. I win!

10:58.104 --> 11:00.271
- He-yah! Ha, who'd have thunk?
- Come on!

11:00.306 --> 11:01.772
- Video games actually are fun.
<i>- Aah, I'm sorry.</i>

11:01.808 --> 11:03.374
He just doesn't understand anything.

11:03.409 --> 11:05.810
What?! I killed all the
guys in the red berets.

11:05.845 --> 11:08.446
Okay, we are the guys
wearing the red berets.

11:08.481 --> 11:10.047
Well, you're not really dead.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.149
- Hey, guys.
- Craig?

11:12.185 --> 11:13.451
What are you doing here?

11:13.486 --> 11:16.420
Well, I was gonna get you the
limited edition copy of the game.

11:16.456 --> 11:17.922
Look at you. You look red.

11:17.957 --> 11:19.957
- You might need this.
- Oh, yeah!

11:19.992 --> 11:23.327
- This is exactly what I want.
- Aren't you supposed to be in school?

11:23.362 --> 11:25.262
<i>Well, I'm supposed to, uh, be,</i>

11:25.298 --> 11:26.197
- well, you know...
- I'm just kidding.

11:26.232 --> 11:28.283
I guess since we're pretending
that we're soldiers,

11:28.284 --> 11:30.634
we could also pretend that
you're not skipping school, okay?

11:30.670 --> 11:32.169
Hey, Craig, I'm the one that's cool

11:32.205 --> 11:34.138
with him skipping school.
I'm his dad!

11:34.173 --> 11:35.506
Well, you shouldn't be cool
with him skipping school,

11:35.541 --> 11:36.874
because you're his dad.

11:36.909 --> 11:38.642
Ooh, I wish you were
wearing a red beret.

11:38.678 --> 11:40.344
And I would just
pew! pew! pew!

11:40.379 --> 11:44.014
He drives me crazy.
He's so selfish.

11:44.050 --> 11:46.117
And he's rude to my fiancé.

11:46.152 --> 11:48.452
It's like I finally
got my life together,

11:48.488 --> 11:50.287
and suddenly Zorn's back
with all the problems

11:50.323 --> 11:52.223
we had when we were married.

11:52.258 --> 11:54.425
I get it.
My ex is the worst, too.

11:54.460 --> 11:57.027
He slept with my hair stylist
just as she was finally,

11:57.063 --> 12:00.798
- finally starting to understand my curls.
- My ex committed genocide.

12:00.833 --> 12:03.634
- Yeah. No, you got me there.
- You know what?

12:03.669 --> 12:05.536
I'm gonna stop complaining about Zorn.

12:05.571 --> 12:08.606
My friends told me that
it's kind of a... bummer.

12:08.641 --> 12:10.207
- What?!
- Mm-hmm.

12:10.243 --> 12:12.143
You should be able
to bitch about your ex

12:12.178 --> 12:13.978
- whenever you feel like it.
- Really?

12:14.013 --> 12:17.148
- Yes. You can with me.
- Thank you.

12:17.183 --> 12:18.716
As long as you don't
mind me bitching back.

12:18.751 --> 12:20.284
<i>Are you lost, maiden?</i>

12:20.319 --> 12:22.853
<i>Zorn will protect you.</i>

12:27.426 --> 12:30.427
- Oh. Wow! Okay...
- What are you doing?

12:30.463 --> 12:33.330
Just wanted to see what it
was like to punch a bastard.

12:33.366 --> 12:35.733
- Oh.
- Yeah. I'm fine!

12:35.768 --> 12:37.648
- We have one flare left.
- Mm-hmm.

12:37.683 --> 12:39.336
Tunnels filled with methane gas.

12:39.372 --> 12:42.106
So Alan throws the flare, I shoot it.

12:42.141 --> 12:44.008
- We run. Boom!
- Boom!

12:44.043 --> 12:47.311
<i>And then we hear a voice.
"25 kills."</i>

12:47.346 --> 12:49.046
<i>Kill-basa, baby!</i>

12:49.081 --> 12:52.349
<i>I'm sorry, if I could just
interrupt real quick. It's just, Craig,</i>

12:52.385 --> 12:55.619
you said "kills," even
though your kills aren't real.

12:55.655 --> 12:58.489
Mine, on the other hand,
I can still hear them screaming,

12:58.524 --> 13:02.593
"You've got the wrong person, man,"
every time I close my eyes.

13:02.628 --> 13:04.261
Dad, it's just video games, all right?

13:04.297 --> 13:06.130
We're not interested in the
actual psychological toll

13:06.165 --> 13:08.566
- that warfare takes on your mind.
- Oh, no, no, no.

13:08.601 --> 13:10.835
I-I know that. I'm just saying,
Craig's a total fraud,

13:10.870 --> 13:13.337
and the only thing he's ever
killed was this awesome vibe

13:13.372 --> 13:14.972
- we had going before he arrived.
- Okay, look,

13:15.007 --> 13:16.740
Zorn, why do we even have to compare?

13:16.776 --> 13:19.376
I mean, can't we both be
killers in our own way?

13:19.412 --> 13:20.178
Oh, you want to be a killer?

13:20.179 --> 13:22.546
Okay, well, here's something
you can kill for real.

13:22.582 --> 13:25.616
Whoa! Hey, come on.
Those are kettle cooked.

13:25.651 --> 13:28.586
- Hey, Dad, call it off, all right?
- Only if he admits his kills are fake.

13:28.621 --> 13:30.020
<i>Oh! Whoa!</i>

13:30.056 --> 13:33.757
Oh. Alan?
Hey, look behind the water heater.

13:33.793 --> 13:37.661
You'll see my manuscript.
If I die, get it to a publisher.

13:37.697 --> 13:40.464
And then add this bird thing
on at the end. Oh!

13:40.499 --> 13:41.699
- Oh! Oh!
<i>- Clawthor, let go!</i>

13:41.734 --> 13:44.235
All right, come on, Alangulon.
We can still salvage the day.

13:44.270 --> 13:47.271
- What?!
- Oh, okay. So you want to stay with Craig.

13:47.306 --> 13:48.939
That's what you're saying?
Fine. I see how it is.

13:48.975 --> 13:51.709
Oh, yeah, clap away, you nerds.

13:54.013 --> 13:55.979
- Very funny.
- Hey, grab him.

13:56.014 --> 13:59.625
Which one of you put my invisibility
cloak over a parking meter, huh?

14:00.511 --> 14:03.511
Meka-Zorn? 
Where are you?

14:03.547 --> 14:06.648
I need you to kill Craig, or
think of another fun activity

14:06.683 --> 14:09.751
- for me and Alangulon.
- Zorn. There you are.

14:09.786 --> 14:12.655
- What are you still doing here?
- I was just working late, you know,

14:12.656 --> 14:16.524
getting our proposal done.
That's what buddies are for, right?

14:16.560 --> 14:18.627
Buddies? Wait, I'm sorry,
you think we're buddies?

14:18.662 --> 14:22.230
- Well, we seemed to... get along earlier.
- Hey, hey, shut up.

14:22.266 --> 14:25.200
I got to ask you something important.
Have you seen...

14:25.235 --> 14:30.171
- have you seen me?
- Um... I'm seeing you now.

14:30.207 --> 14:31.745
Right, right, right, right.
Okay, new plan, new plan.

14:31.844 --> 14:35.310
Uh... I'm gonna go look
around for, um, something.

14:35.345 --> 14:37.445
But if you... see me...

14:37.481 --> 14:40.382
- uh, call me.
- Okay.

14:42.419 --> 14:44.753
Yeah!

14:44.788 --> 14:47.789
- Yeah!
- You're getting it good!

14:47.824 --> 14:49.257
I need more booze.

14:49.293 --> 14:51.993
The more sober I get,
the less beating up

14:52.029 --> 14:54.696
<i>an exact replica of my ex feels okay.</i>

14:54.731 --> 14:56.831
- My turn.
- Your turn.

14:56.867 --> 14:58.466
Hey, Jake!

14:58.502 --> 15:01.905
Why don't you take custody
of this pan?

15:03.473 --> 15:06.207
Oh!
Oh, I'm sor...

15:06.243 --> 15:09.444
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

15:10.647 --> 15:13.982
Hey.
Mmm...

15:15.852 --> 15:18.186
- Linda!
- Hey. What?!

15:18.221 --> 15:19.454
Hey!

15:21.858 --> 15:24.693
Edie!
Don't jump to conclusions.

15:24.728 --> 15:28.463
I was not about to start
having sex with Meka-Zorn.

15:28.498 --> 15:31.333
- What?!
<i>- See, what we have here is...</i>

15:31.368 --> 15:35.637
this is the best of both worlds.
It's, like, all the good...

15:35.672 --> 15:37.806
m-muscle-y parts of a guy

15:37.841 --> 15:41.876
without all the...
stupid guy parts... of a guy.

15:41.912 --> 15:46.214
<i>- I am Zorn!
- Hey, shh...</i>

15:46.249 --> 15:49.651
No, you're not.
That's what makes you good.

15:50.754 --> 15:54.142
- Hey, Mom! Hey, we're back.
- Hey! Alan...

15:54.177 --> 15:59.127
Oh, you are walking
out here at... the right time.

15:59.162 --> 16:00.628
<i>- Sure.
- Oh, hi.</i>

16:00.664 --> 16:02.664
Edie, I didn't know
you had a guest over.

16:02.699 --> 16:06.028
- Hi. I'm Craig.
- Hi. I'm Linda.

16:06.063 --> 16:10.905
I'm Zorn's boss, and Edie's
# new best friend for friggin' life. #

16:10.941 --> 16:13.241
Okay. So you've been drinking.

16:13.276 --> 16:14.509
- Yes.
- Not really that much.

16:14.544 --> 16:16.829
Uh, Zorn, it's good
to see you again after

16:16.830 --> 16:20.582
not having seen you
earlier in the day. Wink, wink.

16:20.617 --> 16:22.283
- Why'd you say "wink, wink"?
- Oh.

16:22.319 --> 16:24.252
I meant to just wink.
I'm sorry.

16:24.287 --> 16:28.156
- Craig, this isn't actually Zorn.
- Oh, right. Okay.

16:28.191 --> 16:30.458
This is Meka-Zorn.
It's Dad's robot decoy.

16:30.494 --> 16:32.060
<i>Why is he here?</i>

16:32.095 --> 16:33.900
<i>Oh, we were just getting
our aggressions out </i>

16:34.014 --> 16:37.309
- on Zorn with him.
- Oh. So being positive

16:37.344 --> 16:38.666
- is working out?
- You know what?

16:38.702 --> 16:40.435
If Bridget and Vicky
don't want me bitching

16:40.470 --> 16:43.104
about Zorn, then they're not
my true friends.

16:43.140 --> 16:46.808
They are not your true friends.
Hi.

16:46.843 --> 16:49.144
- I'm your mom's best friend.
- Hi.

16:49.179 --> 16:51.346
Well, since you're all griping
about Zorn again,

16:51.381 --> 16:52.981
do you mind if I take a whack at it?

16:53.016 --> 16:54.482
- No. Do it.
- Really?

16:54.518 --> 16:55.750
- Yeah.
- It's a good time.

16:55.786 --> 16:57.552
- You should try it out.
- It feels good.

16:57.587 --> 16:59.320
- Get it out.
- This one seems good.

16:59.356 --> 17:00.475
Zorn.

17:00.510 --> 17:02.657
<i>I am Zo-Zo-Zo-Zo-Zo-Zo...</i>

17:02.692 --> 17:05.059
- Oh. Did I do something?
- Oh. I got it.

17:05.095 --> 17:07.060
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

17:07.097 --> 17:09.396
She's a pro at this...

17:09.433 --> 17:11.199
<i>Bomb mode activated.</i>

17:11.233 --> 17:13.334
Uh-oh. Did I do something?

17:13.369 --> 17:16.204
Oh, no, this... this is one
of Dad's dumb pranks.

17:16.239 --> 17:17.839
<i>Terminate enemies of Zorn!</i>

17:17.874 --> 17:19.825
I was wrong.
It's a bomb.

17:20.842 --> 17:23.241
<i>Here, Meky-Meky.
Here, Meky-Meky. </i>

17:23.277 --> 17:24.509
Zorn on the horn.

17:24.545 --> 17:26.877
<i>- Hey, Zorn. It's me, Todd.
- And?</i>

17:26.914 --> 17:30.015
<i>Well, you told me to tell
you when I see you again.</i>

17:30.050 --> 17:34.553
- I see you. Hi.
- Hey, Todd, I don't have time to talk

17:34.554 --> 17:36.054
to a big baby man right now.
You dig?

17:36.090 --> 17:39.357
You know what, Zorn?
I don't get you.

17:39.393 --> 17:42.227
I mean, at first you hate me,
then you like me,

17:42.262 --> 17:44.722
and then you hate me again.
I mean,

17:44.757 --> 17:47.899
if we're gonna be friends,
you got to open up to me right now!

17:47.935 --> 17:49.901
Oh, okay.
Well, Todd, if you must know,

17:49.937 --> 17:53.004
I'm worried my son's soon-to-be
stepdad is replacing me!

17:53.040 --> 17:55.240
Why?
You seem like a strong parent!

17:55.275 --> 17:56.842
I guess I'm just scared
we'll never be close,

17:56.877 --> 17:58.376
and I'm gonna lose him!

17:58.412 --> 18:01.079
Well, maybe by forcing him
to be close, you're actually

18:01.115 --> 18:04.116
- pushing him away!
- Yeah? Well, that's very insightful!

18:04.151 --> 18:06.418
If you love your son,
you should be happy for him!

18:06.453 --> 18:09.187
Some people don't have
a male role model in their life!

18:09.223 --> 18:10.989
Your son could have two!

18:11.024 --> 18:12.757
Damm it, Todd, you're right!

18:12.793 --> 18:15.244
<i>Oh, great. Now he and Craig
are blowing up a bounce</i>

18:15.245 --> 18:17.696
house so they can bounce
together like best buds.

18:17.731 --> 18:19.564
<i>What?!
Meka-Zorn's a bomb?</i>

18:19.600 --> 18:21.801
Yeah, well, I hope he blows up that
stupid bounce house.

18:21.802 --> 18:24.340
Oh, wait, hold on a second.
Oh, there was no bounce house.

18:24.370 --> 18:27.105
- Oh, okay. Now I get it.
- Zorn, what the hell

18:27.141 --> 18:28.874
are you talking about?!

18:28.909 --> 18:31.877
Oh, I just don't get it. So we got
the red wires, the blue wires.

18:31.912 --> 18:33.011
- I tried that.
- There's some, like, wet

18:33.046 --> 18:35.147
lizard-tail-looking
things, do we pull that?

18:35.182 --> 18:37.048
I hate Zephyrian technology...
it doesn't make any sense!

18:37.084 --> 18:38.350
<i>Zorn is not here.</i>

18:38.385 --> 18:40.886
Edie is drunk.
I just met Belinda.

18:40.921 --> 18:42.554
So I guess Craig is in charge.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.489
So this is what we're
gonna do, the brave thing.

18:44.525 --> 18:45.991
We're gonna get the hell out of here

18:46.026 --> 18:47.759
and go stand in the front yard.
Let's go!

18:47.794 --> 18:48.793
Fear not!

18:48.829 --> 18:51.496
This looks like a job that would be

18:51.532 --> 18:53.798
good for it to be done by Zorn!

18:53.834 --> 18:55.000
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Oh, man, Meka-Zorn</i>

18:55.035 --> 18:56.568
- makes that seem easy.
- Nobody cares!

18:56.603 --> 18:58.403
- Let's go! Look!
- Hurry up!

18:58.438 --> 18:59.738
All right, let's see what we got here.

18:59.773 --> 19:02.607
- Just got to bypass the old bomb mode.
- It didn't work when I tried it.

19:02.643 --> 19:04.643
<i>- Exiting bomb mode.
- Yes!</i>

19:04.678 --> 19:06.444
<i>- Entering kill mode.
- Zorn!</i>

19:06.480 --> 19:08.780
<i>No! Dad!
What did you do!</i>

19:08.815 --> 19:11.449
Okay, relax, everybody.
That's just a bug in the O.S.

19:11.485 --> 19:13.619
I should have done an
update instead of hitting

19:13.620 --> 19:15.885
"remind me later" every day
for the last two months.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.657
Now all I have to do
is defeat him in combat,

19:18.692 --> 19:20.058
which I've done, like,
a thousand times...

19:20.093 --> 19:22.110
- Zorn! Whoa!
- Ah!

19:26.433 --> 19:29.332
<i>Craig, Alangulon,
listen to me...</i>

19:29.367 --> 19:31.736
it's up to you now to fight Meka-Zorn.

19:31.772 --> 19:34.039
<i>And yes, in battling an evil nemesis,</i>

19:34.074 --> 19:35.907
<i>you will have a bonding
experience that will</i>

19:35.943 --> 19:38.637
<i>bring you even closer.
One of you will die.</i>

19:38.672 --> 19:40.512
Craig, I'm almost
certain it's gonna be you.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.515
But that's only because
I programmed him to do that.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.984
<i>Meka-Zorn!
Hey, Meka-Zorn!</i>

19:46.019 --> 19:48.341
And after that, Alangulon and
I will bond over

19:48.448 --> 19:50.422
your memory
and become stronger,

19:50.457 --> 19:52.490
the father and son that
we were always meant to...

19:53.660 --> 19:55.994
<i>I am Zorn...</i>

19:56.029 --> 19:57.884
<i>- Yeah, we did it!
- Oh! Whoo!</i>

19:57.898 --> 19:59.898
<i>Kill-basa, baby!</i>

19:59.933 --> 20:02.718
- Whoo! Score!
- Oh, come on, now, did you get him wet?

20:02.719 --> 20:05.170
If you get him wet,
it voids the warranty.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.706
<i>Skipping school
to get a video game?</i>

20:07.741 --> 20:09.674
Did you really think that's okay?

20:09.710 --> 20:12.043
And you, Zorn, skipping work to do

20:12.079 --> 20:13.712
something with your kid, or something?

20:13.747 --> 20:16.214
Well, you guys did bring
a bomb into the house.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.744
- Hey, at least I didn't kiss it.
<i>- Hey!</i>

20:18.779 --> 20:20.018
<i>I get it.
We shouldn't have lied.</i>

20:20.053 --> 20:23.088
Is there something maybe we
could do to make it up to you?

20:23.123 --> 20:25.490
- Honestly, Alan?
- Pizza.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.926
- You could get us pizza.
- Hawaiian.

20:27.961 --> 20:29.594
Hey, Dad, you want to go
with me to get a pizza?

20:29.630 --> 20:32.497
- It'd be, like, a quest.
- Really? You mean that?

20:32.532 --> 20:34.599
- Yeah.   - Well, in that case,
Clawthor the Taloned One

20:34.635 --> 20:37.668
can show us the way to the pizza parlor.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.039
Oh!

20:41.074 --> 20:43.258
I am not gonna even
pretend that I'm sad that

20:43.259 --> 20:45.443
that bird is dead.
It tried to fly away with me.

20:47.114 --> 20:49.281
<i>Are you lost, maiden?</i>

20:49.316 --> 20:52.183
<i>Zorn will protec-tec-tec-
tec-tec-tect you.</i>

20:56.857 --> 21:01.508
<i>I am Zorn...
Zo-o-o-orn...</i>

21:02.963 --> 21:05.330
<i>See you in hell,
Vul-Vul-Vul-Vul-Vul...</i>

21:05.365 --> 21:07.632
<i>I am... Zorn will protect you.</i>

21:09.703 --> 21:12.971
<i>I am... Zorn.</i>

21:13.006 --> 21:14.873
<i>Nobody is planning a sneak attack.</i>

21:14.974 --> 21:16.374
