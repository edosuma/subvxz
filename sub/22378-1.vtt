01:16.676 --> 01:18.644
That was fast.
Hi.

01:18.646 --> 01:19.845
Oh, so lovely to meet you.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.713
Good to meet you, too.
Hi!

01:21.715 --> 01:24.183
Hi, Honey! This is my dog. I'll
put her in the... in the bedroom.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.118
Come on in.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.687
You know we're neighbors?
I live just down the road.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.322
- Whoa.
- Hey...

01:30.324 --> 01:32.257
I'm going to start with the
cabinets.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.726
That sounds great.
It's chaos we're remodeling.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.328
Make yourself at home.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.731
Come on... come on, Jax!

01:55.815 --> 01:57.382
Those are the... the notebooks?

01:57.384 --> 01:59.585
Yes.

01:59.587 --> 02:02.754
May I?
Yeah... here.

02:05.658 --> 02:08.759
Each exhibit gets its own...
Yes.

02:08.762 --> 02:12.865
So tell me about tonight's
opening? Congratulations.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.366
Thank you.

02:14.368 --> 02:17.603
You found a cell phone
on the street.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.438
You did not know
who it belonged to.

02:21.608 --> 02:24.543
I started interviewing people
from the phone's address book...

02:24.545 --> 02:28.680
about the man to whom it
belonged, Arthur Anderton.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.183
I looked at his GPS history...

02:31.185 --> 02:33.785
the places he had been,
visited those places...

02:33.787 --> 02:36.688
photographed them... listened
to his music.

02:38.291 --> 02:41.894
I began to see the phone
as a prism...

02:41.896 --> 02:44.596
through which I might see
the man.

02:46.799 --> 02:48.734
Was there anything that you
didn't look at?

02:48.736 --> 02:53.172
I didn't look at his web history
or read his emails.

02:53.174 --> 02:57.943
I wanted the device to...
offer up information...

02:57.945 --> 03:00.779
that he might share with me
himself...

03:00.781 --> 03:03.649
under different circumstances,
of course.

03:05.585 --> 03:08.654
How does Arthur Anderton feel
about this?

03:10.456 --> 03:13.592
While developing the exhibit,
his friends and family...

03:13.594 --> 03:16.395
seemed to think that he
would love it.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.630
But he didn't?

03:18.632 --> 03:20.299
No.

03:24.370 --> 03:27.372
Um... you also do performance
work?

03:27.374 --> 03:32.277
What would you say is the
unifying theme...

03:32.279 --> 03:34.980
The unifying theme?
behind your, um...

03:34.982 --> 03:37.482
everything you do?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.887
Chance.

03:44.524 --> 03:49.728
I like to allow circumstances to
present themself...

03:49.730 --> 03:53.665
and then I rise up to meet them.

03:53.667 --> 04:00.305
Circumstances are the...
dictator's of my work.

04:00.307 --> 04:04.910
Like a piece of string, I pick
it up and follow it along...

04:04.912 --> 04:07.813
and see where it takes me.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.443
Thank you, thank you again...

06:18.445 --> 06:20.579
and, um, I hope our paths
cross again.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.447
Me, too.
Thanks. Bye.

06:25.985 --> 06:27.386
Has he been walked?

06:27.388 --> 06:28.720
Not since like 11:00.

06:28.722 --> 06:32.157
Okay, maybe I'll walk him.
Come.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.826
I won't be here
when you get back...

06:34.828 --> 06:35.994
I'm gonna go get ready.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.562
Okay, see you tonight.
Yeah.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.198
How long have you been
representing her?

07:46.200 --> 07:50.902
Uh... how long have I been
representing you?

07:50.904 --> 07:54.606
Oh... a long time, we're old
friends.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.575
He is my mentor at art school.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.809
Oh.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.046
Scary.

08:13.192 --> 08:14.759
Thank you so much.
Thank you for coming.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.561
I thought you named her.
So original.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.830
No, we're just meeting.
This is Paul.

08:20.199 --> 08:22.534
He's my uh... dealer, Paul.

08:22.536 --> 08:23.668
Hi.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.710
Arthur Anderton.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.148
And now with this technology...

08:37.150 --> 08:38.650
we all walk around with these
phones...

08:38.652 --> 08:41.019
kind of attached to ourselves.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.921
We don't memorize
anybody's phone numbers anymore.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.656
Not at all.
Right?

08:44.658 --> 08:45.891
It's true!
Everything is just built...

08:45.893 --> 08:47.259
in these little boxes.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.899
Arthur?

08:56.068 --> 08:58.670
I'm very glad you could
make it tonight.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.975
Did my mother give you
this photo?

09:05.578 --> 09:07.145
Yes.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.587
I'm glad that you're here.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.889
You don't find it awkward
to meet me?

09:17.891 --> 09:20.892
A real human being.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.161
It's very nice to meet you.

09:34.273 --> 09:39.911
This little domain, it's...
mine.

09:39.913 --> 09:44.349
This body, these arms,
these legs, mine.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.354
You've done a bad thing.

10:11.978 --> 10:14.312
Well, I thought it went
good tonight...

10:14.314 --> 10:16.348
very, very good.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.656
They're gonna put your interview
on the cover, you know?

11:51.277 --> 11:55.113
Yeah, well I thought the show
was very good tonight.

11:57.983 --> 12:01.319
How do you feel about the shoot
tomorrow?

12:01.321 --> 12:03.288
Huh?

12:03.290 --> 12:07.192
Can you just give me a minute?

12:07.194 --> 12:09.127
Yeah.

12:20.139 --> 12:23.475
Um, you know, Arthur is gonna
sue?

12:23.477 --> 12:24.976
What?

12:24.978 --> 12:27.412
Yeah, I had a little talk
with him.

12:29.849 --> 12:31.015
Where are you going?

12:31.017 --> 12:32.884
To get water. You want some?

12:32.886 --> 12:34.152
No.

12:38.524 --> 12:44.195
Ow! Ow!
Fuck, who moved this thing?

12:46.866 --> 12:52.103
You know... if he sues,
it's all a good thing.

13:23.068 --> 13:26.437
Hello?

13:26.439 --> 13:29.541
No, there's no one here
by that name.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.951
Oh!

13:39.953 --> 13:41.186
Paul?

13:41.188 --> 13:44.389
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Paul?

13:44.391 --> 13:47.392
Hey! Stop that!
Stop!

13:47.394 --> 13:49.828
What is it? What's going on?

13:49.830 --> 13:51.896
There was this woman,
and he was...

13:51.898 --> 13:53.264
Where? What happened?
On the ground.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.066
But what happened?

13:55.068 --> 13:58.102
He had her head down and he was
bashing her.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.839
He looked right up at me.

14:03.209 --> 14:06.211
Fuck! God damn it!

14:06.213 --> 14:07.378
Let's call the police.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.113
And tell them what?

14:09.115 --> 14:10.548
And tell them!

14:12.518 --> 14:18.022
I can't. I... it wouldn't be
fair.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.924
It wouldn't be fair.

14:25.164 --> 14:28.466
I'll call from my cell phone
anonymously, an anonymous tip.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.235
That's not anonymous, Miranda!

14:30.237 --> 14:32.237
Is she okay? Do you think he's
still following her?

14:32.239 --> 14:33.938
What are you gonna
say to them?

14:33.940 --> 14:35.373
What did he look like?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.609
He was a white guy.
He had dark hair.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.379
Jesus!

14:41.381 --> 14:44.182
Paper? Paper? Paper? Paper?

14:44.184 --> 14:46.117
She had a coat.

14:53.425 --> 14:54.893
Did you see his face?

14:54.895 --> 14:56.928
He was looking right up at me.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.235
<i>OPERATOR
You've reached 911.</i>

15:04.237 --> 15:07.939
<i>You're call is important to us.
Please hold.</i>

15:07.941 --> 15:09.307
What's happening?

15:09.309 --> 15:12.176
I've been put on hold.
Hold?

15:16.081 --> 15:19.017
Hello? Yes, I'd like to report
an attack...

15:19.019 --> 15:22.387
that took place on the corner
of Revery and 4th.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.923
No, it's not going on now.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.925
About 5 minutes.

15:29.061 --> 15:31.062
What the hell?

15:31.064 --> 15:34.198
I think it's weird that you
answered my phone.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.000
What made you do that?

15:36.002 --> 15:38.002
It was ringing.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.305
Who was it?
Wrong number.

15:42.074 --> 15:43.675
So what made you answer it?

15:46.312 --> 15:48.513
Hello. Yes, I can.

15:51.984 --> 15:55.386
Caucasian man, tan coat,
dark hair.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.425
Yes, that's correct.
That's me.

16:01.627 --> 16:06.064
Yes. Miranda F-A-L-L, Fall.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.166
Thank you. Thank you so much.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.535
They are sending someone
over tomorrow.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.503
Oh, great.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.172
Shoot.

16:20.679 --> 16:24.015
Can you tell me anything else
about what he looked like?

16:28.420 --> 16:33.424
Square-cut jaw. Dark hair.

16:36.095 --> 16:39.330
Widows peak, maybe not.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.001
Maybe not.

16:49.641 --> 16:52.010
I just want to understand
it a little bit better...

16:52.012 --> 16:55.546
so you be me, and I'll be you.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.415
I'm sitting here.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.250
The phone rings.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.688
I go to answer it.

17:08.660 --> 17:13.431
And I believe that I see an
attack happening below.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.175
<i>Now he was about right here.</i>

17:24.176 --> 17:26.477
<i>And... um.</i>

17:26.479 --> 17:31.349
<i>He had his right arm
in this position here...</i>

17:31.351 --> 17:37.822
<i>and... and hurled my arms um,
behind her back all twisted up.</i>

17:37.824 --> 17:42.460
<i>And he was... he was sort
of bashing...</i>

17:42.462 --> 17:44.662
<i>bashing her into the pavement.</i>

17:44.664 --> 17:49.434
<i>And I made a noise up there and
he looked right up at me.</i>

18:14.226 --> 18:19.163
Um... I like the one
on the left, I think.

18:19.165 --> 18:22.867
Okay. We'll get going on that
right away.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.736
Thank You.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.206
No worries, boss,
start from downstairs.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.176
Hello.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.746
No way!

18:35.748 --> 18:37.782
You called the police.

18:37.784 --> 18:42.553
Um... first of all,
don't get excited.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.289
This is not a coincidence.

18:48.393 --> 18:57.268
Are you gonna let us in?
Come in! Come in! Come in!

18:57.270 --> 18:58.736
Hi.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.605
Hi.

19:02.374 --> 19:03.774
I heard you called in.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.643
You heard?
Yeah.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.712
You're a bit of a cult figure
down at the precinct, so...

19:07.714 --> 19:09.614
What?

19:09.616 --> 19:12.216
In a former life, I went to
college with this young lady.

19:12.218 --> 19:13.918
Really?

19:13.920 --> 19:16.888
I'm sorry. Miranda, this is Miss
Snow. She's the sketch artist.

19:16.890 --> 19:20.291
Hi.
Hi.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.392
Would it be okay if I...

19:21.394 --> 19:22.727
Yes.
set my things...

19:25.731 --> 19:27.265
This is great.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.466
Thanks.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.369
I'm sorry, can I get you
some tea?

19:31.371 --> 19:32.904
No thanks, I'm fine.

19:32.906 --> 19:37.775
Yeah, you have quite the
reputation with the police.

19:37.777 --> 19:42.380
That thing you did with the,
um... surveillance camera.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.348
Cameras!
Yeah.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.917
That got you some friends.

19:45.919 --> 19:48.219
That's really weird.

19:52.224 --> 19:56.460
He had his right arm like this,
kind of holding her.

19:56.462 --> 20:00.731
And her right arm was twisted
back behind her back.

20:00.733 --> 20:04.602
And he was bashing, bashing her
into the pavement.

20:04.604 --> 20:08.206
I made some noise and he looked
right up at me.

20:11.443 --> 20:14.245
Let's begin with the eyes.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.680
The eyes?

20:15.682 --> 20:17.982
Yes, always the eyes first.

20:19.351 --> 20:20.751
Okay.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.654
Dark eyes.

20:27.859 --> 20:31.262
Yes, I remember now, big,
dark eyes.

20:33.332 --> 20:35.866
Square-cut jaw.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.670
Dark hair.

20:44.476 --> 20:48.412
Widow's peek, maybe not.

20:51.783 --> 20:54.352
Maybe not.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.955
Shut up.

20:57.957 --> 21:01.259
Is their anyway I can keep this,
over night possibly?

21:01.261 --> 21:02.893
So, it's okay with me.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.929
Thank you. I appreciate it.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.965
I'll call you tomorrow morning
with any possible changes.

21:07.967 --> 21:11.469
Congrats on the uh... the
reviews this morning.

21:12.571 --> 21:13.871
Yeah.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.706
What, you don't like great
reviews?

21:15.708 --> 21:17.942
The guy I did the exhibit
about isn't happy.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.411
I wouldn't think that would
bother you.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.812
No, I...

21:21.814 --> 21:23.681
Regret.
I had to do it.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.383
But uh...

21:27.519 --> 21:30.921
Question. This series here?

21:30.923 --> 21:32.890
Uh... it's called bag.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.925
Do you wanna sit for it?

21:34.927 --> 21:37.728
Uh...

21:37.730 --> 21:39.430
What would I have to do?

21:39.432 --> 21:41.332
I would take your photo and then
you would give me...

21:41.334 --> 21:42.667
everything in your bag.

21:48.907 --> 21:51.742
Um... when would I get it back?

21:51.744 --> 21:52.843
When the show is done.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.346
And when is that?
12 weeks.

21:55.348 --> 21:59.083
You would keep your credit
cards, ID, cell phone, keys...

21:59.085 --> 22:01.319
but you have to give me
everything else.

22:01.321 --> 22:04.522
So all this crap was in what?
Someone's purse?

22:04.524 --> 22:05.723
Look at the photo.

22:07.793 --> 22:10.061
It's your crap.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.796
All right.

22:12.898 --> 22:14.632
Yes?

22:14.634 --> 22:15.833
Where do I put this?

22:15.835 --> 22:17.702
Great!

22:21.540 --> 22:24.375
Okay, so I'm just gonna take
everything out...

22:24.377 --> 22:25.776
and then you're gonna
arrange it?

22:25.778 --> 22:27.645
No, you're going to arrange
it on here.

22:27.647 --> 22:30.581
And I'm going to put this glass
case over it.

22:33.552 --> 22:34.919
Reviews.

22:40.992 --> 22:43.761
Whoa! I get your official
weapon?

22:43.763 --> 22:46.530
I like my fucking job, I'm not
gonna give up my weapon.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.599
No, that stays here.

22:48.601 --> 22:51.702
This is a collector's item.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.104
It's my baby.

22:53.106 --> 22:54.805
I just happen to have it
on me today.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.407
No bullets.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.508
Would you like to hold it?

22:57.510 --> 22:58.909
Oh God, no.

23:00.779 --> 23:04.515
Uh...
Goji berries!

23:04.517 --> 23:07.051
Good for the prostate.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.853
My life is laughable.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.921
Did she do this when you pulled
out your stuff?

23:10.923 --> 23:12.490
No.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.658
Just you.
Just me?

23:14.660 --> 23:18.863
She was really serious?
Did you snort?

23:23.068 --> 23:27.171

24:42.814 --> 24:44.215
Hey.
Hello.

24:44.217 --> 24:45.950
Sorry I didn't make it to the
opening.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.084
Please don't worry about it.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.819
Paul said it was smashing.

24:48.821 --> 24:49.987
Hello.
Hi.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.655
I feel sick.
Ms. Fall.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.023
Nice to see you again.
Hello.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.692
Your usual?
Yes, please.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.093
Let me get you another bottle.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.561
This one's almost out.

24:59.631 --> 25:01.131
It's that big?

25:05.537 --> 25:08.506
Well, this is gonna be an
exercise in futility.

25:08.508 --> 25:10.841
Thank you for doing this.

25:15.146 --> 25:16.747
How are you?

25:16.749 --> 25:19.783
Hold on one sec.
Let me get some better ice here.

25:21.753 --> 25:25.222
You see, I think... I think the
nose should be more elongated...

25:25.224 --> 25:27.558
and the face more oval.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.159
But you said square cut jaw?

25:29.161 --> 25:30.995
Yeah, I know.

25:30.997 --> 25:34.732
But I think... now I think the
face should be more oval.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.233
More feminine somehow.

25:44.309 --> 25:47.244
That's all folks.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.079
Bye, cookie.
Bye.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.247
Bye.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.555
Poor guy, huh?
Mm.

25:57.557 --> 26:02.760
Now listen, this... you really
need to stick to installations.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.061
No, seriously.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.696
You want me to help you
with this?

26:05.698 --> 26:07.097
No!
No, come here, no, no, no.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.332
No!
We're gonna give him...

26:08.334 --> 26:09.867
How about a butt chin?
James!

26:09.869 --> 26:12.136
No, no, wait, look.
Who am I? Who am I?

26:29.955 --> 26:32.022
<i>ARTHUR
You've done a bad thing.</i>

26:46.338 --> 26:47.838
Fetch, Jax!

26:57.248 --> 26:59.183
Looking good.

27:10.929 --> 27:13.697
Hello?

27:13.699 --> 27:16.233
I'm here for a lineup.

27:39.024 --> 27:40.791
Thanks for coming in, ma'am.

27:43.328 --> 27:46.196
Standard procedure.
Don't worry about it.

27:46.198 --> 27:49.166
They can't see you,
but you can see them.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.969
Is Ms. Lockwood already
processed?

27:51.971 --> 27:54.171
Do you mean Margeret Lockwood?
The woman in the hall?

27:54.173 --> 27:57.107
The victim of the
assault you witnessed? Yeah.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.308
What?

27:58.310 --> 28:01.045
Do you know the victim?

28:03.748 --> 28:04.982
How badly was she hurt?

28:04.984 --> 28:06.750
But you didn't recognize her?

28:08.687 --> 28:10.054
During the attack?

28:11.423 --> 28:12.756
No.

28:12.758 --> 28:14.224
But you did see the perpetrator?

28:14.226 --> 28:17.361
He looked right up at me.

28:19.931 --> 28:23.333
Will she be doing the lineup,
as well?

28:23.335 --> 28:29.373
Uh... the victim didn't see
the attacker, ma'am.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.409
My God, she interviewed me
that morning.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.944
Get the lights.

28:42.087 --> 28:44.822
Man number one, step forward.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.960
Man number two, step forward.

28:51.262 --> 28:55.733
Man number three, step forward.

28:55.735 --> 28:59.903
Man number four,
please step forward.

29:03.308 --> 29:05.109
Man number five...

29:07.445 --> 29:14.284
please... step forward.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.339
Hey.

29:38.543 --> 29:39.910
Hey.

29:41.412 --> 29:42.813
Hi.
How'd it go?

29:42.815 --> 29:45.516
Uh...

29:45.518 --> 29:47.217
Were you able to ID anyone?

29:47.219 --> 29:49.319
Uh... no.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.922
No, definitely not.

29:58.163 --> 30:00.030
Were you at least gonna say hi?

30:00.032 --> 30:02.232
Who were the men in the lineup?

30:02.234 --> 30:04.034
Um...

30:04.036 --> 30:05.936
Who was man number five?

30:05.938 --> 30:07.838
Who?

30:07.840 --> 30:10.274
Who... who is he?

30:12.143 --> 30:16.046
Weird? I know him.

30:16.048 --> 30:18.382
And not from the attack.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.951
But I know him.
I know I know him...

30:20.953 --> 30:22.319
he's so familiar.

30:31.930 --> 30:33.463
<i>MAN #1 I suppose
you couldn't put it...</i>

30:33.465 --> 30:35.532
<i>- to her in someway?
- MAN #2 What?</i>

30:35.534 --> 30:39.269
<i>MAN #1 Well... people
just don't vanish and so forth.</i>

30:39.271 --> 30:40.938
<i>MAN #2
She has.</i>

30:40.940 --> 30:42.072
<i>MAN #1
What?</i>

30:42.074 --> 30:44.041
<i>Vanished.
Who?</i>

30:44.043 --> 30:45.976
<i>The old dame.</i>

30:45.978 --> 30:47.477
<i>MAN #1
Yes.</i>

30:47.479 --> 30:50.380
<i>MAN #2
Well? Well, how could she?</i>

30:50.382 --> 30:52.883
<i>What?
Vanish.</i>

30:52.885 --> 30:54.451
<i>Vanish?</i>

30:54.453 --> 30:56.086
<i>I don't know.</i>

30:56.088 --> 30:57.588
<i>Well, that just explains
my point.</i>

30:57.590 --> 31:00.557
<i>People don't just disappear
into thin air.</i>

31:45.604 --> 31:46.970
I like her in that close.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.071
Yeah.

31:50.208 --> 31:54.144
That one's amazing.
Oh my God, look at her eyes.

31:56.981 --> 31:59.182
Miranda, that is amazing.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.586
Who keeps calling me?

32:02.588 --> 32:06.657
What's crazy is that...
Excuse me a second.

32:06.659 --> 32:10.494
Ä°n this one her face
looks blue.

32:10.496 --> 32:14.298
Right? It's like transferring
from her hand to her face.

32:39.157 --> 32:42.459
Hi. Yes. Um...

32:43.962 --> 32:45.395
Oh, no.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.433
Look at this disaster.

32:49.435 --> 32:52.502
Nothing got stolen except
for the baby pictures.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.738
He's a fucking lunatic!

32:57.375 --> 32:59.076
Projectors aren't broken...

32:59.078 --> 33:01.345
at least he was nice enough
to leave those alone.

33:23.267 --> 33:24.634
Did Arthur do this?

33:24.636 --> 33:26.403
I guess.

33:26.405 --> 33:29.272
We get the surveillance tapes
in an hour to confirm.

33:32.510 --> 33:37.647
It's very timely.
He was talking about suing?

33:37.649 --> 33:40.450
I can have his ass in jail
for this shit!

33:40.452 --> 33:42.753
Excuse me.

34:03.241 --> 34:04.741
Hey, are we supposed to be open?

34:04.743 --> 34:07.544
Allison, do you have fucking
eyes in your head?

34:07.546 --> 34:08.745
Get them out of here!

34:08.746 --> 34:10.679
I want to let them in.

34:12.382 --> 34:14.484
Would you prefer we didn't?

34:16.687 --> 34:19.755
Don't touch anything else. We
should just leave it how it is.

34:19.757 --> 34:22.324
I had a feeling she'd say
something like this.

34:22.327 --> 34:24.127
It's so much better this way,
Cleo.

34:24.129 --> 34:27.264
There is so much more
of him here. It's better.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.331
Could you stop, please? Just
leave everything how it is.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.268
Thank you.

34:31.270 --> 34:35.371
We'll create perimeters...
around each of his sculptures.

34:37.341 --> 34:39.076
It's better.

34:39.078 --> 34:41.511
You've just... we're just going
to leave it?

35:17.348 --> 35:19.616
Paul, are you okay to
just leave it?

35:28.559 --> 35:31.862
It's to just leave
it coincidentally.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.403
And there she goes.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.568
Mommy!

36:11.570 --> 36:15.572
<i>- MIRANDA
October 28th. -00pm.</i>

36:17.375 --> 36:19.843
<i>I have found you,
man number five.</i>

36:22.313 --> 36:25.182
<i>And a new project begins.</i>

36:28.186 --> 36:33.190
<i>PAUL
Hello? It's me. Hello? It's me.</i>

36:42.668 --> 36:45.602
<i>MIRANDA
First floor.</i>

36:45.604 --> 36:47.337
<i>Third floor.</i>

38:56.400 --> 38:59.869
<i>October 28th. 8:30pm.</i>

39:02.840 --> 39:06.543
<i>I am in number five's hallway.</i>

39:06.545 --> 39:11.114
<i>Right now the man is walking
around behind...</i>

39:11.116 --> 39:14.718
<i>this door.</i>

39:18.556 --> 39:20.990
<i>The guy from the lineup
showed up at the gallery?</i>

39:20.992 --> 39:24.394
And the victim was in my house
just days ago.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.796
<i>PAUL
Wow.</i>

39:26.798 --> 39:29.566
Yeah.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.534
And it's not just that.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.670
First time I saw him...

39:33.672 --> 39:36.473
<i>He probably followed you
from the police station.</i>

39:36.475 --> 39:39.509
The point of a line up, Paul,
is that they can't see you.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.978
<i>You know some of these guys
are real criminals.</i>

39:41.980 --> 39:44.381
<i>It could have been the guy
that assaulted her.</i>

39:46.717 --> 39:50.053
<i>What... what is this piece
you are doing anyway?</i>

39:50.055 --> 39:52.822
<i>What exactly are you
trying to do?</i>

39:54.959 --> 39:56.593
I don't know.

39:57.628 --> 40:00.063
<i>Paul?</i>

40:00.065 --> 40:02.799
<i>Coming, darling...
to be continued.</i>

40:10.508 --> 40:12.108
Hi.

40:15.846 --> 40:18.047
You wanted something?

40:18.049 --> 40:23.553
No? Water? You sure?

40:30.828 --> 40:35.665
<i>MIRANDA October 31st...
you were never here.</i>

40:37.201 --> 40:40.203
<i>Last night a man walked
into myself.</i>

40:46.577 --> 40:48.144
<i>Let me take that again.</i>

40:51.015 --> 40:54.484
<i>Last night, a man walked
into my life.</i>

40:54.486 --> 40:56.219
Hi, sorry, I'm a little late.

40:57.621 --> 40:58.922
Hi.

41:04.528 --> 41:05.728
Good to see you.

41:05.730 --> 41:07.130
Have you been here long?

41:07.132 --> 41:08.998
I can amuse myself.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.868
Happy Halloween.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.670
Would you like something
to drink?

41:13.672 --> 41:15.672
Happy Halloween!

41:15.674 --> 41:17.073
Come on!

41:18.476 --> 41:20.109
Takes one to know one.

41:24.582 --> 41:26.015
There you are.

41:28.586 --> 41:29.786
Can I get you something?

41:29.788 --> 41:33.556
Yeah... um... oh... hey!

41:33.558 --> 41:35.058
Where's James tonight?

41:35.060 --> 41:36.759
Excuse me?

41:36.761 --> 41:38.895
Oh... I don't know,
I'm new here.

41:38.897 --> 41:40.029
Well, you still serve scotch,
right?

41:40.031 --> 41:41.631
Always!
Yeah.

41:41.633 --> 41:42.765
Well, I'll have a Macallan
on the rocks.

41:42.767 --> 41:44.501
Sure thing, beautiful.

41:48.873 --> 41:50.707
So?

41:50.709 --> 41:52.775
Ignocio, where is James?

41:52.777 --> 41:55.011
I have no idea.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.881
Never showed up to work Monday.
We left a couple of messages.

41:57.883 --> 42:01.284
So that's that. This guy here,
very nice.

42:01.286 --> 42:02.952
That's that?

42:02.954 --> 42:05.054
What can I say, I'm running
a business.

42:09.927 --> 42:12.629
He's been here since
I moved here.

42:12.631 --> 42:14.664
Years.

42:14.666 --> 42:17.800
Well, do you have anyway
of getting in touch with him?

42:19.069 --> 42:20.670
No, this way my way.

42:31.148 --> 42:32.282
How is your family?

42:32.284 --> 42:33.850
Happens all the time
in my business.

42:33.852 --> 42:35.585
People getting fired?

42:35.587 --> 42:38.788
No, people suddenly
not showing up anymore.

42:38.790 --> 42:40.857
Ah... you'd be surprised.

42:40.859 --> 42:45.295
Talking about the people
that just vanish.

42:45.297 --> 42:46.729
Family files a report.

42:46.731 --> 42:48.164
They think they're dead.

42:48.166 --> 42:50.633
And then five years later,
they turn up...

42:50.635 --> 42:51.968
somewhere across the country.

42:51.970 --> 42:53.636
They don't take money
or clothes?

42:53.638 --> 42:57.006
Sometimes... sometimes
they just...

42:59.977 --> 43:01.110
That really happens?

43:01.112 --> 43:02.946
That really happens.

43:05.215 --> 43:09.185
Taxi! Airport, please.

43:10.722 --> 43:14.891
Taxi! Airport, please!
Airport, please!

43:14.893 --> 43:18.628
Taxi! Airport, please.

43:18.630 --> 43:20.897
How's it going? How's the case?

43:20.899 --> 43:22.298
It's over and done with.

43:22.300 --> 43:23.299
What?

43:23.301 --> 43:24.767
That's my news...

43:24.769 --> 43:26.135
What happened?
They got their man.

43:26.137 --> 43:27.937
Colleague of mine obtained
a confession...

43:27.939 --> 43:29.806
to a bunch of different
assaults...

43:29.808 --> 43:33.142
and your case was one of them.

43:33.144 --> 43:35.144
One of the men in the lineup?

43:36.380 --> 43:38.715
Yes.
When, when did this happen?

43:38.717 --> 43:40.350
Uh... yesterday.

43:40.352 --> 43:41.918
They incarcerated him yesterday?

43:41.920 --> 43:45.021
Yes, they incarcerated him
yesterday.

43:45.023 --> 43:47.156
That's good news.
That's good news.

43:47.158 --> 43:50.226
That's really wonderful.
It is.

43:53.731 --> 43:56.099
What about the other men
in the lineup?

43:58.636 --> 44:00.036
Who were they?

44:01.205 --> 44:02.839
What do you mean, who were they?

44:02.841 --> 44:04.774
Were they all violent criminals?

44:04.776 --> 44:07.877
Ah... no, they were not violent
criminals.

44:07.879 --> 44:09.679
No?
Just a couple of cops.

44:09.681 --> 44:10.880
A couple of petty thieves.

44:12.216 --> 44:13.316
Thank you.

44:13.318 --> 44:15.785
There is nobody violent,
dangerous?

44:15.787 --> 44:18.287
Nobodies.

44:23.861 --> 44:25.895
Incognito.

44:27.031 --> 44:28.197
That was fun.

44:28.199 --> 44:29.399
It was.

44:37.107 --> 44:39.042
Um...

44:58.762 --> 45:00.329
Goodnight.

45:00.331 --> 45:02.699
Goodnight.

45:02.701 --> 45:04.701
Get home safe.

45:20.317 --> 45:22.819
<i>- MIRANDA
November 4th. -00pm.</i>

45:27.891 --> 45:32.462
<i>From here on in,
let us call the man "S".</i>

45:37.735 --> 45:42.405
<i>I follow S to a fairly busy
shopping district.</i>

45:42.407 --> 45:47.977
<i>And I watch him buy a wrinkled
green and pink polka dot scarf.</i>

45:52.082 --> 45:55.151
<i>Which the sales girl, in red,
is about to give him.</i>

45:55.153 --> 45:58.454
<i>In a white bag.</i>

45:58.456 --> 46:04.160
<i>I wonder, who is the woman,
that S is buying the scarf for?</i>

46:17.307 --> 46:20.276
Jax!

46:20.278 --> 46:21.878
Hello?

46:23.914 --> 46:25.314
Jax?

46:30.387 --> 46:31.988
Jax!

46:31.990 --> 46:33.890
Come here, boy.

46:47.004 --> 46:48.404
Jax!

47:06.857 --> 47:08.558
Hi, baby.

47:08.560 --> 47:10.326
Hey.

47:10.328 --> 47:12.028
Don't you feel well?

47:18.202 --> 47:20.336
What the hell, Jax?

47:21.505 --> 47:23.406
What the hell?

47:23.408 --> 47:24.974
You peed?

47:27.144 --> 47:29.412
Jax, what the hell?

47:35.252 --> 47:37.520
Get the ball, boy.

47:37.522 --> 47:42.525
Don't you wanna play more?
Come on, baby.

47:45.562 --> 47:48.097
Fetch the ball!

47:48.099 --> 47:50.233
Come on, Jax.

47:50.235 --> 47:51.968
Here we go. One more time.

47:58.041 --> 48:00.109
Oh, there you are.

48:00.111 --> 48:02.011
Here I am?

48:02.013 --> 48:06.082
I've been here for the last
3 hours. Speaking of which...

48:06.084 --> 48:07.416
Well, I was looking for you
ten minutes ago.

48:07.418 --> 48:08.985
You weren't here.

48:08.987 --> 48:11.087
Yes, I was.
Must of been in the bathroom.

48:11.089 --> 48:13.556
I haven't left my chair
for literally three hours.

48:13.558 --> 48:15.958
Whatever. I, um, I just wanted
to let you know...

48:15.960 --> 48:17.660
that my nephews are here.

48:17.662 --> 48:19.595
Oh... Nino and Sammy.

48:19.597 --> 48:22.999
And... Detective Andy called
on the office line.

48:25.469 --> 48:27.003
I know.

48:27.005 --> 48:30.640
It was the same in college.
Trust me.

48:30.642 --> 48:32.241
Oh, my goodness.

48:32.243 --> 48:33.976
Did you guys have a thing?

48:33.978 --> 48:36.479
Oh, come on, just tell me.

48:36.481 --> 48:38.180
That's not going to work...

48:38.182 --> 48:39.949
because I'm actually not going
to be here.

48:39.951 --> 48:43.953
Yeah, we leave...
Come on, soccer! Yeah!

48:43.955 --> 48:46.222
On Thursday night and
get in Friday morning.

48:46.224 --> 48:49.325
Get the ball!

48:49.327 --> 48:52.094
Wednesday, we're coming
back. Uh-huh.

48:52.096 --> 48:54.030
So we're gonna get in Friday
morning.

48:54.032 --> 48:56.198
So it's just a little tight.

48:56.200 --> 48:58.301
Hey, Jax! Where are you, honey?

48:59.236 --> 49:02.271
Come here, sweetheart.

49:05.175 --> 49:06.609
Bang!

49:08.445 --> 49:10.012
Jax is acting strangely, huh?

49:10.014 --> 49:11.714
Uh, yeah...

49:11.716 --> 49:14.617
it's like somebody's replaced my
dog with another dog.

49:14.619 --> 49:16.285
Bang!

49:16.287 --> 49:17.720
This looks yummy.

49:17.722 --> 49:19.388
I'm making them dinner.
Do you want some?

49:19.390 --> 49:21.958
Yes, please.
Mm-hm.

49:24.294 --> 49:25.661
What's wrong?

49:25.663 --> 49:27.596
No, I'm stressed about my trip.

49:27.598 --> 49:31.067
Honey, your trip is going to be
wonderful.

49:31.069 --> 49:32.468
I told you my cousin
is gonna be here.

49:32.470 --> 49:34.370
She said she'd be happy
to help with anything.

49:34.372 --> 49:36.205
No strangers in the house.

49:36.207 --> 49:39.008
What's with that self portrait?

49:43.613 --> 49:47.249
That's the assailant!
That's the police sketch.

49:47.251 --> 49:48.751
Oh, I thought it was you.

50:09.539 --> 50:11.540
That's not a real gun.

50:29.760 --> 50:31.594
Because it was Halloween...

50:31.596 --> 50:34.630
and they wanted the full like
haunted house experience.

50:34.632 --> 50:38.567
And then all of a sudden,
I just feel myself grabbed...

50:38.569 --> 50:41.070
and pulled up, and I can't even
breathe.

50:41.072 --> 50:42.605
And I'm snorting out
of my nose...

50:42.607 --> 50:44.707
to wake up the people
in the room.

50:44.709 --> 50:46.642
Thank God they saw me.

50:46.644 --> 50:49.211
I'm like at 45 degrees.

50:49.213 --> 50:50.813
They spring up.

50:50.815 --> 50:53.416
And they're shaking me,
and my eyes are open.

50:53.418 --> 50:55.051
And I'm going.

50:55.053 --> 50:56.452
Like trying to get to them.

50:56.454 --> 50:58.320
And then finally whatever it was
was released.

50:58.322 --> 51:01.824
Instead of me getting out of bed
or anything you'd imagine.

51:01.826 --> 51:04.393
I just curled up into this fetal
position.

51:04.395 --> 51:07.096
Felt so violated and I was
like no.

51:07.098 --> 51:08.831
Oh, no.

51:08.833 --> 51:10.299
That's terrifying.

51:10.301 --> 51:12.134
It was terrifying,
and then I stayed awake.

51:12.136 --> 51:14.437
I would not...
Of course, you did.

51:14.439 --> 51:15.738
And waited until...

51:15.740 --> 51:17.106
Oh wow, waited for her
to come back.

51:17.108 --> 51:18.641
That was it, I was done.

51:29.820 --> 51:32.721
I haven't had anybody this nice
to me in a long time.

51:34.658 --> 51:39.695
Did you know that heart cells...

51:39.697 --> 51:45.167
want to beat at the same time.

51:45.169 --> 51:48.104
So, like if you put a cell
from my heart...

51:48.106 --> 51:50.172
and a cell from yours...

51:50.174 --> 51:55.744
in a dish together, within
however many, I don't know...

51:55.746 --> 51:57.880
hours they would be pulsing
at the same time.

51:57.882 --> 52:01.183
They like reach towards each
other to try to sync up.

52:01.185 --> 52:03.819
It's true.

52:03.821 --> 52:06.489
I'm waiting to see if they
start to sync up.

53:11.621 --> 53:13.289
Jax?

53:28.572 --> 53:30.272
Hello?

53:40.550 --> 53:42.718
Yeah, yeah.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.554
Well, he wouldn't be putting
the painting up...

53:45.556 --> 53:47.790
if he wasn't trying to sell
the fucking thing.

53:47.792 --> 53:50.726
Tell him he's a surrealist.

53:54.965 --> 53:57.566
I think Arthur may have been
in my apartment.

53:57.568 --> 53:58.901
What?

53:58.903 --> 54:00.669
Twice now I've come home...

54:00.671 --> 54:02.838
and the big Chaise lounge
was in a different place.

54:02.840 --> 54:04.974
Well, you had painters in there
all week.

54:04.976 --> 54:07.509
Well, they finished last week.

54:07.511 --> 54:09.345
And Karin left for Paris
on Thursday.

54:09.347 --> 54:10.746
Okay.

54:10.748 --> 54:12.314
Did one of them have a key?

54:12.316 --> 54:13.549
No.

54:13.551 --> 54:17.519
But the lock on my building door
is broken.

54:17.521 --> 54:19.021
Was your sibling in the
building?

54:20.724 --> 54:23.525
I have to ask him.
I don't think so.

54:24.928 --> 54:27.630
Although I wonder.

54:27.632 --> 54:31.300
Is it fair of me to deny Arthur
access to my apartment?

54:31.302 --> 54:32.801
What?

54:32.803 --> 54:35.271
Well, there can't be one set
of rules for me...

54:35.273 --> 54:36.772
and another for everyone else.

54:36.774 --> 54:39.908
Audrey, give me Stearns on the
phone, okay?

54:39.910 --> 54:42.611
Arthur? Arthur?

54:42.613 --> 54:43.712
How would he have gotten in?

54:43.714 --> 54:46.348
I keep a key under my doormat.

54:49.786 --> 54:54.456
And you... you think Arthur came
into your apartment...

54:54.458 --> 54:56.425
and moved your Chaise lounge
around?

54:57.994 --> 54:59.662
Oh, Jesus.

55:03.500 --> 55:05.901
Are those real?

55:15.745 --> 55:18.547
<i>- MIRANDA
November 12th. -00 PM.</i>

55:21.785 --> 55:25.788

my frozen feet.</i>

55:39.102 --> 55:44.073
<i>I follow S down a street not
far from where I live myself.</i>

55:45.675 --> 55:47.609
<i>I'm just a few paces behind...</i>

55:47.611 --> 55:50.913
<i>though he does not acknowledge
me.</i>

55:50.915 --> 55:55.351
<i>He must know I am here, by now.</i>

55:55.353 --> 55:59.355
<i>Earlier today, S took me to the
west side of the city.</i>

56:00.824 --> 56:03.959
<i>Where he allowed me to get
very close.</i>

56:08.598 --> 56:12.534
<i>Before disappearing from my
sights all together.</i>

56:18.141 --> 56:19.842
<i>And then...</i>

56:21.077 --> 56:24.713
Oh, my God.

56:24.715 --> 56:27.583
<i>MIRANDA Like he walked
right into me again.</i>

56:28.685 --> 56:33.889
<i>Right into... this very room.</i>

56:55.745 --> 56:57.813
Hello.
Hello.

57:04.554 --> 57:06.455
Uh... Mr. Martinelli?

57:06.457 --> 57:10.159
Did you move a chair
in my apartment?

57:10.161 --> 57:12.895
Move your chair?

57:12.897 --> 57:16.732
Yes, the Chaise lounge in my
apartment.

57:18.902 --> 57:24.807
Would you like some help
with something, Ms. Fall?

57:24.809 --> 57:27.142
No, don't worry about it.
Thank you.

Hello. I'm sorry to disturb
you so late.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.070
Hi!

01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:43.305
Uh... the door down stairs
was open.

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:44.840
Oh, yes, I know.

01:00:44.842 --> 01:00:48.210
I've just made some tea.
Would you like some.

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:08.430
Scene of the crime.

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:12.000
How are you feeling?

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:19.074
I've been such a fan of yours
all these years.

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:20.676
I don't know.

01:01:22.712 --> 01:01:26.281
I'm not the same as I was
the last time I was here.

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:32.120
My DNA is different.
Thank you.

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:41.463
Why is it that when you got to
the police station...

01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:44.866
you couldn't identify anyone?

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:51.039
I'm sorry, it's so crazy.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:56.078
Because I was here, and then it
was you who witnessed it.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:05.320
What's your new project about?

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.160
They did find him.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:17.766
I know. I know. I just...

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:25.407
I just... I need to know
what happened?

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.479
I heard a man's voice at the
window.

01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:32.748
And I know I did.

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:36.785
I need to know what your new
project is about.

01:02:36.787 --> 01:02:39.488
Paul Stark saw you get attacked,
not me.

01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:47.229
Oh my God.

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:52.534
What if they hadn't caught him?

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:56.338
What if they hadn't caught him.

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:12.087
Did you know that Arthur
Anderton was in the hospital?

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.793
Tried to kill himself.

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:24.132
Is he going to be okay?

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:26.835
They don't know. He shot
himself.

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:33.441
What's going on, Miranda?

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:13.448
<i>ARTHUR
You've done a bad thing.</i>

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:02.023
<i>- MIRANDA
November 16th. -00PM.</i>

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:12.067
<i>S.</i>

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:17.272
<i>S... all along.</i>

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:29.317
<i>November 17th. 5:00PM.</i>

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:31.386
<i>Grey skies.</i>

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:37.425
<i>I wait outside of S' apartment.</i>

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:45.066
<i>I know what I must do.</i>

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:57.545
<i>I must rise and meet the
circumstance.</i>

01:06:59.548 --> 01:07:01.750
<i>I must follow the stream.</i>

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:11.693
Shit. Fuck.

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.619
Love this photo.

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:32.987
Which one?

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:36.724
The one of little you, and your
mom and your dad.

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:40.295
Oh yeah... that's a nice one.

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:53.708
I've been looking and looking
at it a lot recently.

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:04.319
Hey.

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:06.821
Hey.

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:18.733
The morning my parents died,
my mom called...

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:21.636
to see if there was anything
that I wanted from home?

01:12:21.638 --> 01:12:24.038
And I said, my white shirt.

01:12:28.577 --> 01:12:32.046
I don't know how long she spent
looking for the white shirt...

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:35.416
but I know she spent sometime
looking for the white shirt.

01:12:35.418 --> 01:12:41.522
And I know that in a car crash
where a matter of moments...

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:46.561
or a moment is the difference
between life and death.

01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:49.097
That if I hadn't of asked
for the white shirt...

01:12:49.099 --> 01:12:50.898
they would still be alive.

01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:06.781
I am disappearing, Andy.

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.656
You are right here.

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:41.682
Hi.
Hi.

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:50.191
Is that really what I look like?

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:58.566
It was so real for me
when we were at school.

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:03.471
Did you feel it, too?
I always wanted to ask you.

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:12.113
I was just a boy.

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:24.091
By the way, you should be glad
you weren't able to ID anyone.

01:14:24.093 --> 01:14:26.561
Because they put me back
on the case.

01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:29.764
Apparently someone went missing
from your spot.

01:14:29.766 --> 01:14:31.199
The Nightingale.

01:14:31.201 --> 01:14:32.800
What?

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:34.902
A young woman went missing
the other night.

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:37.104
But they found the guy?

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:41.509
Cops can be assholes.

01:14:41.511 --> 01:14:42.810
But he confessed?

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:44.679
A coerced confession.

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:51.185
How?
What?

01:14:51.187 --> 01:14:53.187
How could you not have
told me this?

01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:56.057
I just did.

01:14:57.659 --> 01:14:58.993
Don't worry. You're not involved
any more.

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:03.531
But I am involved, though.
I am involved.

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:08.669
Do you have any idea who it is?

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:10.104
No.

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:11.873
And what about this woman
at The Nightingale.

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:15.610
We think that your case might
be connected...

01:15:15.612 --> 01:15:16.911
to this girl who's gone missing.

01:15:16.913 --> 01:15:18.546
She's gone missing?

01:15:18.548 --> 01:15:19.947
Yes, Friday.

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:27.121
Friday? This last Friday?

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:28.289
What the hell?

01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:30.558
This last Friday?

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.093
Yes.

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:51.112
Ssh, she's asleep.

01:15:51.114 --> 01:15:52.747
She hasn't been able to get
to sleep.

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:57.318
Mr. Stark, I'm going to head
home.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.853
I will see you first thing
in the morning.

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:00.221
Thank you, Imelda, thank you
very much.

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:02.590
I don't know how
to thank you enough.

01:16:02.592 --> 01:16:05.293
Okay, yeah.

01:16:05.295 --> 01:16:09.130
1:00 AM is early to start
drinking.

01:16:09.132 --> 01:16:12.066
You look awful.
Uh-huh.

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:22.143
Paul?

01:16:22.145 --> 01:16:23.277
Hm?

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:28.049
Oh, God, let me guess
where this is going.

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:33.854
I need to know if this
is the same man...

01:16:33.856 --> 01:16:35.656
you saw attack Margeret?

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:37.224
I thought they nailed this guy?

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:39.327
No.

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:46.133
I don't know... it's hard
to say.

01:16:46.135 --> 01:16:47.702
I can't see him properly.

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:49.670
Can you please try to guess?

01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:53.941
I don't know what to tell you.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:02.650
Tomorrow morning, I want you
to come with me...

01:17:02.652 --> 01:17:05.119
and I'll take you to him.

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:06.921
And you'll tell me if it's
the same man...

01:17:06.923 --> 01:17:09.357
you saw outside of my
apartment, okay?

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:20.635
Tomorrow morning I have an
appointment at the hospital.

01:17:20.637 --> 01:17:22.069
Do you have eyes?

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:23.704
A woman disappeared from
The Nightingale...

01:17:23.706 --> 01:17:26.140
the night I followed this man
there.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:28.409
People might get hurt, Paul.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.213
She's awake.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.409
He put something in my closet.

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:05.379
He put a scarf in my closet.

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:09.050
All right, look.

01:18:09.052 --> 01:18:12.319
I'll meet you tomorrow morning
at 10:30 at the gallery.

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:16.791
After I drop her off.

01:18:16.793 --> 01:18:19.126
Are you okay?

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:22.963
Do you wanna sleep here
over night?

01:18:22.965 --> 01:18:27.234
You know when you said, "He
looked right up at me,"?

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:33.174
Does that mean that he saw you?

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:37.344
I'm scared for you, Paul.

01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:40.881
What if he's dangerous and you
can ID him?

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:51.792
You know this thing with Arthur?

01:18:51.794 --> 01:18:57.231
I mean... he was unstable
from the very beginning...

01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:59.300
there is no way you could have
known that, cookie.

01:18:59.302 --> 01:19:03.070
I think it's time to go
to the police.

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:23.357
You know what this is for me?

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:32.767
I love her.
I know.

01:19:32.769 --> 01:19:35.169
I really...
I know, Paul.

01:19:35.171 --> 01:19:38.339
I can't handle it.
It's too much.

01:19:38.341 --> 01:19:40.441
It's too much.

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:02.530
Hey, Paul, it's me,
it's ten to 11:00.

01:20:02.532 --> 01:20:04.532
I hope everything went well
at the hospital.

01:20:04.534 --> 01:20:07.868
I'm at the gallery, give me
a call. Bye.

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:24.952
What time did he bring her
to the hospital?

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:29.957
And when did Mr. Stark leave?

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:36.564
Can I talk to the caregiver,
Imelda, is she there?

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:40.167
<i>MIRANDA
November 18th, 3:00PM.</i>

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:45.139
<i>Because I do not know
what else to do...</i>

01:20:45.141 --> 01:20:46.941
<i>I wait outside for S.</i>

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.182
<i>And follow him down the street.</i>

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:57.484
What do you mean
he wasn't there?

01:20:57.486 --> 01:20:59.887
He would never not be there to
drop her off at the hospital.

01:20:59.889 --> 01:21:01.889
That would never happen.

01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:05.860
<i>MIRANDA I tell myself
it is only in my imagination.</i>

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.463
<i>But I fear S.</i>

01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:13.300
<i>I fear S.</i>

01:21:14.569 --> 01:21:16.871
<i>I fear S.</i>

01:22:52.969 --> 01:22:54.501
Hello?

01:22:54.503 --> 01:22:56.403
<i>ANDY
Miranda, it's Andy.</i>

01:22:56.405 --> 01:22:57.705
Hi.

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:03.444
<i>Listen, I have some news.</i>

01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:06.180
<i>Paul Stark's wife reported him
missing this morning.</i>

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:15.356
Oh no, Andy.

01:23:15.358 --> 01:23:18.659
<i>Okay, just...
I thought it was in my head.</i>

01:23:18.661 --> 01:23:20.327
<i>ARTHUR
You've done a bad thing.</i>

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:22.563
Andy, I have to tell
you something.

01:23:22.565 --> 01:23:24.698
I have to come to the police
station...

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:27.634
and make a statement... okay?

01:23:27.636 --> 01:23:29.403
<i>ARTHUR
You've done a bad thing.</i>

01:23:29.405 --> 01:23:31.005
<i>ANDY He was
supposed to pick her up...</i>

01:23:31.007 --> 01:23:32.639
<i>I'm coming in now.</i>

01:23:32.641 --> 01:23:34.375
<i>morning, but he never did, and
he wasn't in the apartment...</i>

01:23:34.377 --> 01:23:36.143
<i>when the nurse showed up
yesterday morning.</i>

01:23:36.145 --> 01:23:38.312
The Nurse at the Stark
residence...

01:23:38.314 --> 01:23:40.414
says you were there the night
before last.

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:45.386
Which means you were the
last person...

01:23:45.388 --> 01:23:47.588
to actually see Paul Stark.

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.794
She says you were very upset.

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:58.565
What were you doing there
at 2:00 in the morning?

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:02.169
I just told you.

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:12.212
What is your relationship
to Paul Stark?

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:14.748
He's my friend.

01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:16.550
And he's my dealer.

01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:20.320
You are also having a sexual
relationship?

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:24.224
Yes.

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:30.197
Why didn't you tell us...

01:24:30.199 --> 01:24:33.133
that you were having a sexual
relationship with Mr. Stark?

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:36.470
I didn't think of it.

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:41.241
You didn't think it would
matter...

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:43.210
that you're having an affair
with him?

01:24:43.212 --> 01:24:49.817
No, it's not an affair.
It's... it's an arrangement.

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:57.791
What kind of arrangement?

01:24:57.793 --> 01:25:00.227
He loves his wife very much.

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:03.697
Did that make you jealous?

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:06.533
No.

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:10.637
Please, is anybody even looking
into the man...

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:12.406
that I followed to
The Nightingale on Friday?

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:19.146
So you went to visit your
lover... in a very upset state.

01:25:19.148 --> 01:25:20.781
In the middle of the night.

01:25:20.783 --> 01:25:24.685
Because you were having anxiety
over an art project.

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:29.690
What were you doing at The
Nightingale last Friday night?

01:25:29.692 --> 01:25:31.558
I was following that man there.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:34.528
This man in your photos?
Yes.

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:36.130
Because we have a witness...

01:25:36.132 --> 01:25:39.299
that can put you near the bar
that night.

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:41.735
You have a witness that can
put me?

01:25:41.737 --> 01:25:43.670
I came here and I told you
that I was there!

01:25:43.672 --> 01:25:46.440
Why are you getting so agitated?

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:55.649
Hey.

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:02.923
You don't actually think
that I...

01:26:02.925 --> 01:26:09.563
No, no, no, of course not,
don't even worry about that.

01:26:09.565 --> 01:26:13.867
Listen, short of any DNA
evidence or a murder weapon...

01:26:13.869 --> 01:26:17.237
turning up at your apartment
or something like that.

01:26:17.239 --> 01:26:21.208
No, no one really believes that.

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:27.948
I'm guessing your guy will turn
up in a couple days.

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:31.618
Probably just took a little va...
needed a little time away.

01:26:38.893 --> 01:26:41.328
What were you thinking?

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:44.198
I'm a cop.

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:48.268
And I take what I do seriously,
too. Ya know?

01:26:54.742 --> 01:26:57.244
You kind of got inside me there
for a little while.

01:26:57.246 --> 01:26:59.880
But... at the end of the day...

01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:03.884
we don't really know each
other that well.

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:17.751
Ugh!

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:03.790
Andy. Something's happened.

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:05.559
Your gun has been fired.

01:31:05.561 --> 01:31:07.627
I'm afraid that I just found
the murder weapon...

01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:08.762
just like you said.

01:31:08.764 --> 01:31:11.097
Andy, please call me back!

01:31:26.013 --> 01:31:28.248
What the fuck.

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:53.974
You know I can hear
you, right?

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.214
Go away.

01:32:01.216 --> 01:32:03.517
I'm going to keep
banging on this door...

01:32:03.519 --> 01:32:05.252
all night if I have to.

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:10.924
What do you want?

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:20.901
Uh, we're going to
the police right now.

01:32:20.903 --> 01:32:23.737
He's still out there,
it was a coerced confession.

01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:30.944
Why do you have that?

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:38.718
What are you doing with a gun?

01:35:28.355 --> 01:35:30.957
Miranda!

01:35:36.163 --> 01:35:39.733
Oh! Hey! Hey!

01:35:39.735 --> 01:35:43.336
Stop that! Stop that!

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:47.407
Hey, stop that! Stop that!

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:02.455
Oh, fuck!

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:06.192
Call the...!

01:36:06.194 --> 01:36:08.795
Call the police!

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.904
Margeret?

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:20.907
Call the police!

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:24.344
Chain.

01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:32.952
Please. Please. Please.

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:44.497
Get your hands up!

01:36:48.135 --> 01:36:49.569
Put the phone down!

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:56.810
Okay.

01:36:56.812 --> 01:36:59.212
You have right to remain silent.

01:36:59.214 --> 01:37:04.551
Anything you do or say can and
will be held against you...

01:37:04.553 --> 01:37:06.586
in a court of law.

01:37:06.588 --> 01:37:09.856
You have the right
for an attorney.

01:37:09.858 --> 01:37:13.526
If you can't afford an attorney,
you'll be provided with one.

01:37:13.528 --> 01:37:16.462
Do you understand these rights
that I am reading to you?

01:37:16.464 --> 01:37:18.965
Who... who are you?

01:37:21.235 --> 01:37:23.036
What's your name?

01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:32.378
This is Officer 626.

01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:36.015
Requesting a backup on 65th
and Puget.

01:37:36.017 --> 01:37:38.151
Yeah.

01:37:45.926 --> 01:37:47.260
How did you get in?

01:37:48.495 --> 01:37:50.530
Where's my friend?

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:08.047
<i>Hello, it's me. Hello, it's me.</i>

01:38:08.049 --> 01:38:14.020
<i>Hello, it's me. Hello, it's me.</i>

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:18.124
Hey! Put the phone down.

01:38:19.493 --> 01:38:21.561
Put your phone down!

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:36.442
Your fucking friend who attacked
me? How am I supposed to know?

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:41.180
<i>Hello, it's me.</i>

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:45.685
You were in the lineup?

01:38:47.388 --> 01:38:49.489
Which lineup did you see me in?

01:39:25.059 --> 01:39:30.463
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:38.371
Turn around.

01:41:41.628 --> 01:41:44.197
What the hell?

01:41:51.371 --> 01:41:55.308
Let me in! Hey!

01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:57.810
Hey! Let me in!

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:09.622
Ms. Hall... calm down.

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.696
We replaced the locks.

01:42:16.698 --> 01:42:19.165
Sent out a memo.

01:42:27.207 --> 01:42:29.575
Here. Take it.

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:37.517
Take it.

01:44:30.964 --> 01:44:32.665
Taxi!

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:46.779
Airport, please.

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:24.223
I don't know, is that more
interesting than just...

01:49:24.225 --> 01:49:26.692
Maybe just something's fine.
All right, then let's see.
