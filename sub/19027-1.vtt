<i>Since my apartment's roof collapsed,
I was living in a hotel.</i>

00:08.314 --> 00:10.640
<i>But that's not the only thing
that's changed around here.</i>

00:14.805 --> 00:17.986
<i>Now that I'm an attending, I'm a licensed bad-ass.</i>

00:18.510 --> 00:22.555
<i>Elliot actually works at a different hospital.
She's trying to lay low at first.</i>

00:25.150 --> 00:27.232
<i>And Turk and Carla are trying to make a baby.</i>

00:27.428 --> 00:28.677
Here you go, baby.

00:30.608 --> 00:34.535
I know you like foreplay,
but I only have five minutes,
so I made you a sandwich.

00:35.396 --> 00:37.633
That's the sexiest thing I've ever seen.

00:38.149 --> 00:39.425
Over here, Turk.

00:39.766 --> 00:40.832
My bad, baby.

00:41.430 --> 00:43.495
<i>Yep! Life was different.</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:45.069
Hey! Did you take my Porsche from the valet?

00:45.878 --> 00:47.728
<i>This didn't feel like my scooter.</i>

00:50.188 --> 00:52.990
Ow! Look, no harm done. Here are your driving glasses...

00:53.705 --> 00:55.072
...here's your driving scarf...

00:55.908 --> 00:57.050
...and here are your driving gloves.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.942
Fine...here's your driving sock.

01:01.856 --> 01:06.043
<i>I didn't care. Because now that I'm an attending,
I had picked out a whole new look.</i>

01:07.416 --> 01:09.121
Good morning, colleagues!

01:09.607 --> 01:11.012
Oh, absolutely not.

01:11.066 --> 01:15.213
Ohh, what, Tall, Dark and Scary?
I can wear whatever the hell I--
What are you doing?

01:15.817 --> 01:17.690
This is my new imaginary warning light.

01:17.727 --> 01:21.522
Whenever it starts blinking,
a situation has ten seconds to resolve itself

01:21.715 --> 01:24.281
before I flash white with rage and kill someone.

01:24.608 --> 01:27.850
One, two, three, four --

01:28.516 --> 01:31.651
-- seven, eight, nine, and ten.

01:32.195 --> 01:34.338
I had a little trouble getting my
Baby Gap tee-shirt off.

01:34.338 --> 01:35.483
It'll happen.

01:39.096 --> 01:41.103
Okay, I'm--you know,
I'm gonna--I'm gonna go with "ow."

01:41.458 --> 01:42.813
How depressing is it being you?

01:43.206 --> 01:48.120
Would you equate it to being a life-long Cub fan,
or being born without lips?

01:48.517 --> 01:49.463
Born without lips.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.420
I know a guy. His house just burned down.

01:51.765 --> 01:52.556
How sad.

01:52.556 --> 01:56.013
Well, he was smoking in bed.
He shouldn't smoke...'cause he looks ridiculous.

01:57.336 --> 01:58.962
I have a snake face!

01:59.037 --> 02:02.930
Listen, today if you bother me,
could you do it without being around me?

02:03.128 --> 02:04.721
I have new interns starting.

02:04.897 --> 02:08.300
Can you imagine what it must be like to see this place
through their eyes for the first time?

Something on your shirt, kid.

02:19.835 --> 02:21.762
Ha-ha-ha! Classic!

02:27.855 --> 02:30.913
Sparky, it's five dollars a minute to stare in public.

02:31.555 --> 02:33.513
It's free in private...

02:40.055 --> 02:41.363
You're gonna love it here, sport.

02:41.848 --> 02:43.301
Get out while you still can.

02:44.155 --> 02:46.543
Seriously, get out while you still can.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.522
Junior? Have you seen Johnny?

02:49.708 --> 02:52.131
You know, Alzheimer's patient, likes to tackle people?

02:53.675 --> 02:56.250
Has anybody seen Johnny, the tackling Alzheimer's patient?

02:59.078 --> 03:00.523
Hey! You must be Keith.

03:01.236 --> 03:03.407
Don't look so nervous, buddy. I got your back.

03:03.407 --> 03:04.570
WHO AM I!!!???

03:08.107 --> 03:09.051
I found him.

Episode 1 - My Intern's Eyes</i>

03:24.335 --> 03:26.701
Someone's close enough for a hair-mussing!

03:29.758 --> 03:30.991
Heh! Dynamite bangs!

03:31.167 --> 03:32.732
Hey, guys! Follow me.

03:32.736 --> 03:35.750
Listen, if you're having trouble finding a vein for an IV

03:35.965 --> 03:38.960
please don't page me. If you're desperate, we're lucky -

03:38.997 --> 03:43.502
this is a city hospital, there are plenty of heroin addicts who are quite adept at this.

03:43.536 --> 03:45.663
Did you find a vein, there, Reverend Mayhem?

03:46.418 --> 03:47.511
No problem.

03:47.515 --> 03:48.853
Okay, good work, buddy.

03:48.898 --> 03:49.921
Stay in school.

03:49.957 --> 03:51.793
Mr. Kellerman! How're you feeling?

03:51.838 --> 03:52.760
Not great.

03:52.798 --> 03:54.602
Well, that's probably why you're here! Ha!

03:54.976 --> 03:58.391
Humor is a great ice-breaker for patients, okay?

03:58.436 --> 03:59.150
Follow me.

03:59.176 --> 04:01.760
Mr. Kellerman has congestive heart failure.

04:01.806 --> 04:04.522
Okay, Lisa, I want you to start him on diuretics -- okay?

04:04.555 --> 04:06.952
-- that way we'll loosen up some of the fluid around his lungs.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.993
The good news is he'll go home tomorrow.

04:09.028 --> 04:13.300
The bad news is, if he's not here,
he won't move up the heart transplant list.

04:13.338 --> 04:19.572
See, in medicine there are lots of Catch-22s,
a phrase made famous, I believe, by an old fisherman

04:19.617 --> 04:22.931
who would stay out fishing until he caught -
- how many fish? anybody? --

04:22.965 --> 04:24.691
that's right, twenty-two.

04:24.735 --> 04:26.887
See, in 1492, Columbus--

04:26.887 --> 04:28.052
Newbie!

04:28.097 --> 04:31.442
If you loved the sound of your very own voice any more,

04:31.477 --> 04:34.683
you would probably just sit in a little room all day and sing to yourself.

04:34.718 --> 04:36.722
Oh, you guys can skedaddle.

04:44.088 --> 04:45.022
I love interns.

04:45.066 --> 04:48.833
Gentlemen, a reminder: As attendings,
you are expected to turn in your insurance

04:48.866 --> 04:51.061
paperwork and your required urine
sample by tomorrow.

04:51.098 --> 04:53.993
Bob, I'm not planning on doing any paperwork.

04:54.036 --> 04:57.671
But I did go ahead and leave my urine sample
on your driver's side car door.

04:57.717 --> 05:00.021
Perry, your lips, my ass -- they should meet.

05:00.058 --> 05:04.132
Dorian, after four years, I can only hope you
are no longer following in his footsteps.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.242
I turned in my paperwork already,

05:06.286 --> 05:09.231
but I'm gonna wait till tomorrow to turn in my urine sample out

05:09.277 --> 05:11.310
of respect to the fellas in the lab....

05:11.348 --> 05:13.282
There's an asparagus issue.

05:13.315 --> 05:17.211
Now there's an answer
that warrants a half-sincere pat on the shoulder.

05:18.105 --> 05:19.431
Thanks, Dr. Kelso!

05:19.478 --> 05:24.271
You know, he said "half-sincere" but I'm
pretty sure it was full-sincere.
Feel my shoulder -- it's still warm.

05:24.316 --> 05:27.470
Lindsay, by you reaching the level of attending physician,

05:27.746 --> 05:30.972
ou have somehow managed to become a member
of a club that I belong to.

05:31.016 --> 05:34.323
Obviously there was no vote.

05:34.437 --> 05:38.722
Because if there had been, you would still hear the sound of my voice screaming,

05:38.757 --> 05:43.002
Nay, nay, oh, dear God, one thousand times nay!

05:43.037 --> 05:44.551
That being said,

05:44.596 --> 05:50.552
it's my obligation to let you in on
the organization's one and only bylaw:

05:51.366 --> 05:52.530
We're men.

05:52.948 --> 05:53.923
Yes, we are.

05:53.966 --> 05:55.498
...The women are men. The children are men.

05:55.498 --> 05:57.243
The men -- of course -- men!

05:57.656 --> 06:01.911
So, I went ahead and took the liberty
of making you five Man Cards.

06:02.246 --> 06:04.491
Hold them very dear,

06:04.576 --> 06:09.500
because every time you drop the ball,
man-wise, I'm going to take one from you.

06:09.548 --> 06:12.641
I don't need your approval, or your stupid "Man Cards"!

06:13.816 --> 06:16.815
Although the lettering is darling. Have you ever done calligraphy?

06:16.815 --> 06:17.961
Thank you.

06:18.877 --> 06:19.431
Dammit!

06:22.796 --> 06:26.373
That night, since we were low on cash,
Turk snuck me into the movies.

06:27.405 --> 06:28.731
One, please!

06:29.098 --> 06:31.040
<i>Afterwards, we talked about my living arrangements.</i>

06:31.617 --> 06:32.291
Are you sure about this?

06:32.786 --> 06:35.820
You shouldn't stay in a hotel, so why don't you
just stay here until you find a place.

06:35.865 --> 06:38.430
Carla was pretty psyched to get rid of me. Are you gonna tell her?

06:38.465 --> 06:39.791
I don't know. Whatta you think?

06:40.597 --> 06:42.621
Turk? Is that you?

06:44.266 --> 06:45.990
Yes. I'll be right in, baby.

06:46.035 --> 06:47.181
Mm. Mmkay.

06:52.757 --> 06:54.771
Dude, you left your gym shorts in here!

06:55.027 --> 06:56.540
Look, I gotta sex her up.

06:56.576 --> 06:58.043
I'll be back as quick as I can -

06:58.687 --> 07:00.723
- so it'd be about a hour and a half.

07:00.767 --> 07:01.841
Wai-wai-wai-wai-wait!

07:01.875 --> 07:03.560
Could you just quickly scratch my nose?

07:07.767 --> 07:08.223
Okay.

07:08.228 --> 07:08.991
Okay.

07:09.225 --> 07:10.051
Don't zip me!

07:21.307 --> 07:23.203
I'm a little sick of the Turks.

07:23.236 --> 07:24.183
Excuse me?

07:24.976 --> 07:25.850
Heh, not you, Omar.

07:25.888 --> 07:26.830
I love your people.

07:26.876 --> 07:29.542
I'm talking about their lovey-dovey crap.

07:29.575 --> 07:33.540
Oh, babe, I borrowed your backpack this morning
and all my change fell out the bottom.

07:33.576 --> 07:37.703
Maybe someone or something had to gnaw a
hole in it to keep from suffocating.

07:37.736 --> 07:41.701
Maybe someone already apologized
for that about a hundred times.

07:41.740 --> 07:43.385
Well, maybe a hundred wasn't enough? I don't know.

07:43.465 --> 07:45.739
Absolutely no lovers' quarrels.

07:46.558 --> 07:47.148
Dammit.

07:47.745 --> 07:49.033
Elliot, by the way, what are you doing here?

07:49.067 --> 07:51.960
Oh, she hasn't talked to anybody at her new hospital yet.

07:52.007 --> 07:53.813
How did this conversation become about me?

07:53.855 --> 07:55.673
The Turks are sneaky....

07:56.575 --> 07:58.833
Not you guys -- I think Omar took my pudding.

08:01.226 --> 08:01.960
Hey, Keith!

08:02.386 --> 08:03.531
Can I get your pudding?

08:07.365 --> 08:08.292
Interns....

08:09.155 --> 08:11.603
Elliot, you should be excited about meeting people over there.

08:11.645 --> 08:13.323
You could totally reinvent yourself.

08:13.357 --> 08:14.471
You're right!

08:15.645 --> 08:19.743
I'm gonna tell them that I am the most perfect doctor
ever who never needs anyone's help with anything!

08:22.207 --> 08:23.261
That'll end well.

08:23.688 --> 08:24.132
Dude!

08:25.037 --> 08:26.882
That's my pudding Omar!

08:28.306 --> 08:29.643
This guy's unbelievable!

08:31.385 --> 08:36.130
Okay, guys, for some reason Mr. Kellerman's
fluid situation isn't getting any better.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.793
I think we should be more aggressive.

08:37.826 --> 08:38.809
Keith?

08:38.924 --> 08:40.572
Why don't you go get a Lasix drip.

08:41.275 --> 08:42.443
Other way, Keith!

08:47.045 --> 08:50.192
Oh, Jason...when you're filling out a female patient's exam report,

08:50.235 --> 08:52.262
her breasts can be "healthy" or "unhealthy" -

08:52.307 --> 08:54.531
- never "bangin' double-Ds."

08:55.456 --> 08:57.030
There's so much paperwork.

08:57.435 --> 08:59.770
My dad was a veterinarian, and he never had to do any.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.601
Sometimes I wish this place were more like a horse hospital.

09:10.536 --> 09:13.730
I'm sorry, Mr. Larson,
but I do not like the look of that leg.

09:16.727 --> 09:17.892
...We would have better hours.

09:18.778 --> 09:20.791
All right, gang, get out of here.

09:22.558 --> 09:25.162
Hey, everybody? Great work today!

09:26.337 --> 09:28.952
How do you bother someone without being around them?

09:28.986 --> 09:30.132
That is the question.

09:47.528 --> 09:51.013
Dorian, I'm paying you to work,
not stand around acting like The Fonz.

09:51.538 --> 09:52.521
Perfect.

09:54.806 --> 09:57.961
<i>Being Turk's secret roommate was going great...</i>

09:57.996 --> 09:58.732
<i>...until now.</i>

09:58.958 --> 10:00.492
Turk? I'm leaving for work.

10:00.637 --> 10:03.723
Okay. You've been working on your Turk impression since college.

10:03.765 --> 10:04.652
Time to shine!

10:04.927 --> 10:05.443
Turk?

10:05.917 --> 10:10.071
Baby, I'll be thinking about your lovelies and
whatnot until the second I see you, but right now,

10:10.107 --> 10:11.793
I'm doing my business.

10:11.827 --> 10:13.361
Don't forget to use the Glade!

10:14.548 --> 10:17.233
Dude! That's the best it's ever sounded!

10:17.267 --> 10:18.270
I thought she was gone?

10:18.747 --> 10:19.941
Nah, she came back for a quickie.

10:20.246 --> 10:22.901
All this baby stuff, man, I feel like she rushed me into it.

10:22.946 --> 10:24.841
Tell you the truth, I'm not even sure I'm ready.

10:24.885 --> 10:27.371
Well, you better get ready, she's been off The Pill for like a week.

10:28.667 --> 10:29.750
What have you done?

10:45.046 --> 10:46.230
Think she'll be mad?

10:55.095 --> 10:56.852
Dr. Reid? Need some help?

10:57.517 --> 10:58.762
Heh, I don't need anyone's help, thank you.

10:59.827 --> 11:00.933
Stop running!

11:02.216 --> 11:02.970
Doctor?

11:03.786 --> 11:05.151
Do you know where the Foley caths are?

11:05.528 --> 11:07.351
Sir, I know where everything is....

11:08.467 --> 11:09.502
Be right back.

11:11.776 --> 11:13.482
Stupid coffee robot!

11:13.995 --> 11:14.892
Frick!

11:21.288 --> 11:24.391
Don't sweat it, kid. I used to hide here when I worked at this place.

11:24.436 --> 11:25.933
I'm in a fellowship now, heh.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.430
Um, Foley caths, please.

11:29.816 --> 11:30.341
Thanks.

11:36.675 --> 11:39.480
Thanks. Could you also grab a number six needle?

11:41.218 --> 11:42.993
Frick fricky frick frick!

11:47.166 --> 11:48.482
Nice ass, grandma!

11:55.585 --> 11:57.472
That screaming patient would have to wait.

11:57.475 --> 11:58.652
I had bigger problems!

11:58.998 --> 12:00.002
Hey Keith!

12:00.586 --> 12:03.240
I just called upstairs to see how Mr. Kellerman was doing?

12:03.288 --> 12:06.563
And get this -- the nurse told me you never even started him on a Lasix drip.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.663
I'm forced to ask, are you people trained killers?

12:16.078 --> 12:17.541
Say something, Keith!

12:19.797 --> 12:23.277
Dr. Dorian, if he gets bad enough and we have to put him on inotropes,

12:23.277 --> 12:25.920
he'll jump to the top of the transplant list and get a new heart.

12:27.228 --> 12:29.110
<i>They're messing up on purpose?</i>

12:29.638 --> 12:31.472
Who told you guys to do this?

12:31.506 --> 12:33.621
<i>There's a lotta ways to get caught...</i>

12:34.985 --> 12:38.323
<i>Sometimes you get caught because you
couldn't slip your wife her pill last night,</i>

12:38.367 --> 12:40.900
<i>so you had to feed her one of your
special homemade brownies.
</i>

12:41.115 --> 12:42.073
What's that?

12:43.645 --> 12:46.141
Oh, that? That's a tiny marshmallow with writing on it.

12:48.845 --> 12:51.370
<i>Still, if you don't panic, you can get away with it.</i>

12:54.307 --> 12:57.082
Just...doing some inventory...sir. Heh.

12:57.517 --> 13:00.043
That's why I'm glad you work here, sweetheart.

13:05.488 --> 13:06.352
Come on, guys?

13:06.735 --> 13:07.730
Who put you up to this?

13:08.336 --> 13:12.933
<i>As for me, I caught my culprit because he made the classic
mistake of returning to the scene of the crime.</i>

13:12.976 --> 13:17.100
And all because I, too, had been eating
Turk's special homemade brownies.

13:17.137 --> 13:20.802
Angie, my buddy down in the lab just told me that

13:20.837 --> 13:23.793
your urinalysis came back positive for the birth control pill.

13:23.828 --> 13:26.601
So! I will be taking one of...

13:26.618 --> 13:27.581
Thank you!

13:35.276 --> 13:36.350
Keith, look at me.

13:37.256 --> 13:39.770
Did he specifically tell you to disregard my orders?

13:42.067 --> 13:43.300
Aw, what the hell.

13:44.025 --> 13:46.163
I was doing this and mouthing "I'll kill you" -

13:46.667 --> 13:48.380
which I will if you don't get out of here.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.211
I saw it first.

13:59.318 --> 14:00.371
Long Day!

14:00.907 --> 14:05.001
Newbie, I did tell them to ignore you
and let Mr. Kellerman get worse.

14:05.545 --> 14:06.581
And you wanna know something? I'd do it again.

14:10.246 --> 14:11.041
Bye, Elliot.

14:11.266 --> 14:13.773
Look, I know I agreed to have a baby,

14:13.817 --> 14:15.560
but you were offering sex at the time.

14:15.607 --> 14:16.981
I would have agreed to anything!

14:18.178 --> 14:19.453
Carla, no.

14:22.737 --> 14:23.753
NOOO!

14:25.288 --> 14:27.191
She knows I can't eat without my strawberry milk.

14:27.226 --> 14:28.521
You should've just let her fork me!

14:28.805 --> 14:31.710
I...think that's how you got into trouble in the first place!

14:31.716 --> 14:32.743
Heh, whazzup!

14:33.008 --> 14:34.371
Euphemism five!

14:35.128 --> 14:37.061
His vocabulary's gotten so much better!

14:37.268 --> 14:38.483
Elliot, why are you here!?

14:38.528 --> 14:43.390
Oh, I have to make Kelso think I still work here so he
doesn't have me arrested for stealing medical supplies.

14:43.435 --> 14:47.000
By the by, what would you have done if you couldn't give Carla The Pill?

14:47.456 --> 14:48.333
I'd-a faked it.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.022
Guys can't fake it.

14:50.066 --> 14:51.881
Really? Does this sound familiar?

14:51.916 --> 14:56.360
"Ohh, oh, baby, we're going all night. No, wait, don't move!" ...Sorry.

14:57.787 --> 14:59.163
Way too familiar....

15:00.877 --> 15:01.311
Hey!

15:02.105 --> 15:02.943
Thank you.

15:03.208 --> 15:04.230
You know what I've been doing?

15:04.448 --> 15:08.290
I mean, besides listening to my
Alanis Morissette CD to get pumped up to talk to you?

15:08.298 --> 15:08.981
Here.

15:09.177 --> 15:09.782
K'you.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.250
I've been thinking about how completely ridiculous it is

15:12.297 --> 15:15.603
that you would take Mr. Kellerman's life
into your hands without talking to him.

15:15.776 --> 15:16.811
Well, I did talk to him.

15:16.856 --> 15:17.690
He did.

15:18.427 --> 15:22.130
Patients who stay low on the heart transplant list
die waiting for one.

15:22.177 --> 15:24.051
This way, he moves up to the top
of the list, come on!

15:24.095 --> 15:25.532
Then why didn't you tell me?

15:27.948 --> 15:30.231
And that doesn't just mean a fat bank account,

15:30.275 --> 15:33.853
expensive new toys, and a fancy lawyer on retainer for when you kill a prostitute.

15:33.895 --> 15:36.490
>From now on, the buck stops with you.

15:36.525 --> 15:40.801
And I know that you have occasionally bent
the rules in this dump over the past couple of years,

15:40.836 --> 15:45.191
but you only did it because you knew when the crap started
raining down it was damn sure gonna fall on my head.

15:45.248 --> 15:49.761
But now, the only way for you to stay out of
the trouble storm is for you to go by the book.

15:49.967 --> 15:51.342
And I got news for you on that front:

15:51.386 --> 15:53.613
By-the-book attendings kill us up here.

15:55.107 --> 15:59.223
Newbie, I couldn't tell you about Kellerman 'cause
I don't know what kind of attending you're gonna be.

15:59.257 --> 16:03.023
Allow me to thank you for giving me the opportunity
to prove myself. You know what?

16:03.416 --> 16:06.072
This is my last one -- here, take it.

16:06.496 --> 16:09.282
Whatever happens to this poor guy is on you.

16:13.657 --> 16:15.173
The next morning was not good.

16:15.787 --> 16:17.323
Carla was not talking to Turk,

16:18.098 --> 16:20.512
Elliot had dropped by to help not talk to Turk,

16:20.558 --> 16:24.455
and I was sneaking out in my undies because
my clothes were downstairs in the dryer.

16:24.455 --> 16:25.233
J.D.?!

16:25.518 --> 16:28.341
Morning, friends! Who's ready for some java?

16:28.376 --> 16:30.083
Are you wearing boxers?

16:30.126 --> 16:31.870
Yes, I am, Carla!

16:31.876 --> 16:34.903
Because I know when Turk's sad,
he likes me to come over in my boxers,

16:34.938 --> 16:37.181
because he likes to call me his "honky adonis."

16:37.226 --> 16:38.542
And that's what friends do.

16:39.626 --> 16:40.592
<i>They bought it?</i>

16:41.018 --> 16:42.032
<i> Are we that gay?</i>

16:42.317 --> 16:42.903
What's that?

16:43.158 --> 16:44.603
Oh, that's my new driving sock.

16:44.937 --> 16:45.803
You can borrow.

16:45.835 --> 16:48.380
Actually, J.D.'s been living here secretly.

16:48.427 --> 16:48.911
Turk, why!?!

16:49.357 --> 16:51.443
Because I gotta get those
damn judgmental eyes off me!

16:51.777 --> 16:53.580
J.D. didn't want to live here, I begged him.

16:53.625 --> 16:54.543
Is that true?

16:54.587 --> 16:56.312
I didn't say that -- J.D. can do my voice.

16:56.318 --> 16:57.702
Hey, it's getting good!

16:57.737 --> 16:58.422
Well, thank you!

16:58.616 --> 16:59.490
Aw, I lost it....

17:00.037 --> 17:01.852
Ah, you three are ridiculous.

17:02.235 --> 17:04.182
Hey! I'm just here to grab a ride to work.

17:04.217 --> 17:06.172
At a hospital where you don't actually work!

17:06.357 --> 17:07.140
And you!

17:07.358 --> 17:10.550
How am I supposed to tell you that I'm not ready
to have a baby when you're so excited?

17:10.656 --> 17:13.531
And you secretly moving back in here?

17:13.576 --> 17:16.723
Now, I really don't love being den-mother to you three --

17:18.226 --> 17:19.500
-- fine, it's like crack to me.

17:19.537 --> 17:21.121
Still, let me ask you something:

17:21.166 --> 17:23.113
Why are you three so afraid of moving on!?

17:27.176 --> 17:28.130
Dude, you're still eating those brownies!

17:28.176 --> 17:29.632
I don't wanna get pregnant! Shoot.

17:32.036 --> 17:34.831
So you're going to a university for a transplant!

17:34.866 --> 17:37.152
Well, come back and see us, okay!

17:37.186 --> 17:39.802
Who the hell is responsible for not treating that man?

17:39.845 --> 17:42.443
Well, Bobbo, I was going to treat him, but

17:42.488 --> 17:43.823
I lost my stethoscope, and that's--

17:44.047 --> 17:45.030
He's my patient, Bob!

17:46.848 --> 17:47.900
I'm responsible.

17:48.515 --> 17:53.693
Dr. Dorian, I have kept my mouth shut about all the
recent sexual harassment complaints because

17:53.737 --> 17:56.540
I don't think it's fair to punish a man for making small talk...

17:56.578 --> 18:03.121
or, say, asking his secretary just once to dress up
as a geisha girl and call him Kelso-san....

18:03.425 --> 18:04.070
What!?

18:04.117 --> 18:04.820
Nothing!

18:05.167 --> 18:06.263
But now I need to know:

18:06.537 --> 18:08.713
Is this the type of attending you're going to be?

18:09.017 --> 18:10.293
I guess so.

18:11.475 --> 18:12.351
Anything else?

18:13.148 --> 18:17.203
<i>I could tell him there's nothing in my cup and
I'm just pretending to drink to seem nonchalant...
</i>

18:17.665 --> 18:18.463
No.

18:18.507 --> 18:21.352
<i>...But instead I was thinking about what
Carla said about moving on.</i>

18:22.298 --> 18:23.761
<i>And I wasn't the only one.</i>

18:24.007 --> 18:27.102
Well, at least there's one attending around here I can count on.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.413
Ah, the hell with it, Bob. I don't work here!

18:29.458 --> 18:30.182
Have a good one!

18:30.505 --> 18:31.703
I hate this place.

18:32.225 --> 18:33.293
It hates you, Bob.

18:38.236 --> 18:38.953
That's it.

18:39.296 --> 18:41.542
All my birth control pills are gone.

18:42.217 --> 18:46.231
Not exactly. That fig newton you're about to eat
is not only fat-free but it's baby-free!

18:47.687 --> 18:49.222
I just don't get it, Turk.

18:49.498 --> 18:53.713
Look, we had sex twenty times in eight days,
and I bet it's because you sensed my hesitance.

18:53.757 --> 18:56.692
I just want a baby so badly....

18:57.566 --> 19:00.263
Why? What's it gonna be like having a baby?

19:00.695 --> 19:04.822
Dr. Cox says it's like having a dog
that slowly learns how to talk.

19:05.936 --> 19:06.763
Awesome!

19:06.798 --> 19:10.820
Right? And I come from a big family, and I love that.

19:10.968 --> 19:11.690
Mee too!

19:12.745 --> 19:16.080
And...every time we sit at the kitchen table,
I feel like someone's missing.

19:18.888 --> 19:20.151
I can see him....

19:27.586 --> 19:28.183
J.D.!

19:28.257 --> 19:29.670
Gotta make a quick twosie!

19:36.646 --> 19:38.050
This explains a lot.

19:38.388 --> 19:40.341
Hey! Meet your volleyball team.

19:40.918 --> 19:41.491
They're terrible.

19:42.067 --> 19:43.191
Newbie! I heard your voice.

19:49.906 --> 19:52.040
Thanks for nothin', ass-face.

19:53.035 --> 19:54.340
I'm gonna go ahead and give you back

19:54.375 --> 19:55.613
one of these Man Cards.

19:56.877 --> 19:58.050
You deserve it.

19:58.087 --> 19:59.782
Wow. ...Wanna hug?

20:00.448 --> 20:02.303
You held on to it as long as you could, didn't you.

20:02.726 --> 20:04.520
I'm gonna have a good year, aren't I?

20:04.558 --> 20:05.512
Anything can happen.

20:06.718 --> 20:07.580
<i>And I knew he was right...</i>

20:07.938 --> 20:08.622
'Scuse me.

20:11.077 --> 20:11.782
<i>...for all of us.</i>

20:19.015 --> 20:21.300
Oh, Dr. Reid, are you joining us for lunch today?

20:22.046 --> 20:24.560
Ahhh...anyone want half a tofu-cheese sandwich?

20:28.108 --> 20:32.280
'Kay, repeat after me: Boy, boy, boy, very tall boy.

20:32.878 --> 20:34.792
Boy, boy, boy, very tall boy.

20:34.828 --> 20:36.423
Boy, boy...

20:42.368 --> 20:43.522
Goodnight, Keith.

20:43.786 --> 20:45.862
Hey, keep your head up, you're doing a good job.

20:46.637 --> 20:48.262
Thanks for everything, Dr. Dorian.

21:00.815 --> 21:01.991
WHO AM I!?!?!
