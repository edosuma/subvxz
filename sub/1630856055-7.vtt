01:29.300 --> 01:30.900
The king of the Klondike,

01:30.900 --> 01:35.500
Tony Beets,
might be losing his crown.

01:46.634 --> 01:49.100
Nearly two months
into the season,

01:49.100 --> 01:52.100
every miner in the Klondike
is on the gold,

01:52.100 --> 01:53.834
except Tony,

01:53.834 --> 01:56.266
who hasn't mined
a single ounce.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.800
To hit his massive
6,000 ounce goal,

02:06.800 --> 02:10.567
four weeks ago, Tony moved
his entire operation

02:10.567 --> 02:13.533
from Paradise Hill
to Indian River.

02:13.533 --> 02:17.133
Now, he's ready to play
some major catch up.

02:23.133 --> 02:26.600
So far,
Tony's drained and stripped

02:26.600 --> 02:27.934
his flooded cut,

02:27.934 --> 02:29.600
and now, he wants to be

02:29.600 --> 02:31.333
running gold rich pay

02:31.333 --> 02:32.734
by the end of the week.

02:43.634 --> 02:45.300
Gotta get
the shaker deck fixed up,

02:45.300 --> 02:46.433
you know, put together.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.867
Then the next big thing
is getting it in place.

02:48.867 --> 02:50.834
It just takes time
because you have to get

02:50.834 --> 02:52.634
all these little things done.

02:52.634 --> 02:53.634
It's the little things.

02:53.634 --> 02:55.834
They get you. They always
take the most time.

02:56.834 --> 02:59.533
Tony's shaker
wash plant has sat idle

02:59.533 --> 03:00.767
for four years

03:00.767 --> 03:02.900
and needs to be reassembled

03:02.900 --> 03:05.667
before he can do
any sluicing.

03:07.433 --> 03:11.033
To get back on track,
Tony's crew must crane

03:11.033 --> 03:14.867
the seven-ton shaker deck up
and swing it carefully

03:14.867 --> 03:18.600
into place on top
of the wash plant's frame.

03:19.433 --> 03:22.934
Then, lift and swing
the two-ton

03:22.934 --> 03:26.066
spray bars above the shaker.

03:26.066 --> 03:31.166
And finally, bolt its four
metal posts into position.

03:39.233 --> 03:42.834
First up,
the massive screen deck.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.533
I know.

04:31.033 --> 04:32.500
Yeah, we're good.

04:45.467 --> 04:48.433
Next,
the spray bar assembly.

05:07.233 --> 05:08.567
No. No, no, no.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.433
Be very careful next time

05:17.433 --> 05:19.266
you walk underneath
the load like that.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.400
Let go of the chain,
walk around the load.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.300
Oh, my [bleep].

05:59.467 --> 06:01.934
I don't care
if someone [bleep] die

06:01.934 --> 06:03.500
because I just don't
wanna have to go jail

06:03.500 --> 06:04.900
because they didn't
pay attention

06:04.900 --> 06:06.934
when I told them to get out
from underneath there.

06:33.700 --> 06:34.767
It's ready to go.

06:34.767 --> 06:36.066
All we have to do is drag it
to place, put a pump in

06:36.066 --> 06:38.433
and we're golden, literally.

06:52.367 --> 06:54.166
Like every year,
there's a lot on the line.

06:54.166 --> 06:57.166
You know, that's gold mining,
but, you know, this year,

06:57.166 --> 06:59.400
for me, you know,
after taking a year off,

06:59.400 --> 07:00.867
there's even more,
you know what I mean?

07:00.867 --> 07:02.700
This is a second opportunity
for me

07:02.700 --> 07:03.567
to get back where I need to be

07:03.567 --> 07:04.700
and I'm not taking
that lightly.

07:04.700 --> 07:07.834
Rick Ness
is on a comeback mission

07:07.834 --> 07:09.834
to hit 1,000 ounces

07:09.834 --> 07:12.700
and get his life
back on track.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.166
A third of the way
through the season,

07:15.166 --> 07:17.533
Rick's working lean and mean,

07:17.533 --> 07:20.533
sluicing stockpile pay
from the rally valley

07:20.533 --> 07:25.400
and so far, he's only mined
95 ounces of gold.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.800
A lot of it's,
you know, gone towards fuel,

07:27.800 --> 07:29.834
you know, wages and stuff.

07:29.834 --> 07:32.533
I put my camp up on lien
for Troy, you know,

07:32.533 --> 07:35.967
and I owe 150 grand
to him to get it back.

07:35.967 --> 07:39.133
Plus, you know, I also
wanna make some
profit this year.

07:41.867 --> 07:45.734
We had a whole year
and no gold production.

07:45.734 --> 07:47.667
At the start
of the season,

07:47.667 --> 07:50.200
after a year of paying
no royalties

07:50.200 --> 07:52.467
to landlord Troy Taylor,

07:52.467 --> 07:54.634
Rick made a desperate move

07:54.634 --> 07:57.967
to secure
access to the ground.

07:57.967 --> 08:00.367
I'm hoping, you know,
that you can give me

08:00.367 --> 08:01.433
another chance here.

08:01.433 --> 08:04.667
I'm just nervous about
whether you can pull it off.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.467
We need somethin'
to get your foot back

08:06.467 --> 08:07.800
in the door there.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.300
Is there anything we could
work out regarding your camp?

08:11.300 --> 08:13.900
I would be willing to sign
that camp over to you guys.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.233
- Mmm-hmm.
- If you're happy

08:15.233 --> 08:16.734
to have that asset
to hold on to.

08:16.734 --> 08:18.133
I think we can
make it work.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.567
Now, with over
half his gold spent

08:22.567 --> 08:24.266
on running costs,

08:24.266 --> 08:26.734
Rick's down
to just 36 ounces

08:26.734 --> 08:29.100
and his first goodwill
royalty payment

08:29.100 --> 08:30.900
on the camp is due.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.700
- Hey, Rick.
- Hey, Troy.
How you doin'?

08:32.700 --> 08:34.400
Pretty good.
How are you doing?

08:34.400 --> 08:36.367
Good. You just caught me
on my way out.

08:36.367 --> 08:38.367
I guess you probably
know why I'm here.

08:38.367 --> 08:39.734
Uh, yeah.

08:39.734 --> 08:42.700
Yeah, I just gotta collect
on that lien for your camp.

08:44.867 --> 08:46.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Are you doing okay?

08:46.500 --> 08:47.900
Like, you getting some gold?

08:47.900 --> 08:49.266
Oh, we're get...
We're getting some gold.

08:49.266 --> 08:51.533
It's just, uh, you know,
I've been trying

08:51.533 --> 08:53.000
to get more machines here,
more people.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.734
- Yeah.
- You know,
everything costs money.

08:54.734 --> 08:57.066
If you kind of give me
the end of the week, you know,

08:57.066 --> 08:58.967
could I give you, say,
50 ounces?

09:00.233 --> 09:02.900
Oh, boy. That's not what
I was hopin' for.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.266
Yeah, we can wait a little
bit longer and, uh, yeah,

09:11.266 --> 09:13.033
just getting worried,
that's all.

09:13.033 --> 09:15.100
I understand.
Yeah, I get it, I get it.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.233
Well, I appreciate it.

09:16.233 --> 09:18.233
And yeah, I, uh,
by the end of the week,

09:18.233 --> 09:20.800
um, I can stop by.
I'll have 50 ounces for you.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.133
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah.

09:22.133 --> 09:24.233
- All right.
Thanks a lot, Troy.
- You bet.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.533
So Rick promised me 50 ounces
by the end of the week.

09:30.533 --> 09:33.700
As long as he comes
through on that, I'll be fine.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.600
If he doesn't,
then we're gonna have
some problems.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.133
We've already mined 95 ounces
so far this season,

09:41.133 --> 09:43.500
but a lot of that goes
to operation costs, you know,

09:43.500 --> 09:46.867
fuel, food, equipment,
all of that.

09:46.867 --> 09:49.500
Rick is relying
on his small crew

09:49.500 --> 09:53.800
to deliver the rest of Troy's
gold by the end of the week.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.667
Or Troy could sell off
his camp,

09:56.667 --> 09:58.000
ending his season.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.967
We have to get
the 50 ounces
by the end of the week.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.300
Troy put a deadline on us.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.900
And so,
I think the entire crew

10:03.900 --> 10:06.000
is just feeling a lot
of pressure right now.

10:08.300 --> 10:09.567
Uh, we're a little shorthanded,

10:09.567 --> 10:12.400
so everybody just gotta do
everything they can

10:12.400 --> 10:16.233
to keep the operation running
as efficient as possible.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.266
I'm trying
to get everything back

10:25.266 --> 10:27.133
on track with my business.

10:27.133 --> 10:28.667
And I'm trying to be
successful, but, you know,

10:28.667 --> 10:29.934
I owe that to my crew as well.

10:29.934 --> 10:32.600
You know, every single one
of them is taking
a gamble on me.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.500
I don't wanna fail anybody
on my crew.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.734
I mean, I want this to be
a success for everybody.

10:39.734 --> 10:40.900
What the heck?

10:44.867 --> 10:46.834
Rick, you gotta get down here.
Something's burning up.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.367
I have no idea.

11:08.033 --> 11:09.634
It's that.

11:09.634 --> 11:11.066
What the [bleep].

11:14.300 --> 11:16.533
Uh, the smoke
was coming from right there.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.033
Holy [bleep].

11:26.400 --> 11:27.800
Can you tell
what it is?

11:27.800 --> 11:29.367
Yeah, I think so.

11:29.367 --> 11:31.734
The belt just walked way
too far over this way.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.600
Looks like everything
jammed up down there, too.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.700
I'm guessing
the belt stopped spinning,

11:36.700 --> 11:39.066
but it just had pulleyed in.

11:39.066 --> 11:39.900
Yeah.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.867
So, it was rubber
on rubber burning.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.734
Okay.

11:46.734 --> 11:48.266
It blew the belts.

11:48.266 --> 11:51.734
Oh, yeah. This belt
is definitely [bleep].

11:53.000 --> 11:54.367
Cut right [bleep] in half.

11:54.367 --> 11:56.467
Guaranteed... Yup. Oh, yeah.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.700
They're shot.

11:58.700 --> 12:00.333
With no running
wash plant

12:00.333 --> 12:04.500
to deliver Troy 50 ounces
by the end of the week,

12:04.500 --> 12:07.266
Rick's comeback
hangs in the balance.

12:07.266 --> 12:08.900
If we don't have belts
on site,

12:08.900 --> 12:10.800
we're gonna be down
for three plus days.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.900
You know, that's $20,000,
$30,000 worth of lost gold.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.033
I just can't
have that.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.734
I'm in a bad spot
right now. The plant's down.

12:26.734 --> 12:28.233
I got belts ordered.

12:28.233 --> 12:29.367
I don't know
when they're gonna get here.

12:29.367 --> 12:31.734
It's just the belt holding us
from running.

12:31.734 --> 12:33.567
You know, I knew I could have
that belt on there
in ten minutes

12:33.567 --> 12:36.400
so we could be, you know,
putting gold in the box,

12:36.400 --> 12:37.934
which is what we need
to be doing right now.

12:37.934 --> 12:40.433
I mean, Troy Taylor
wants his 50 ounces

12:40.433 --> 12:42.266
by the end of the week.
I don't have it.

12:42.266 --> 12:44.367
I'm counting
on runnin' to get it...
Get his gold.

12:44.367 --> 12:46.700
And here we are
at a standstill.

12:46.700 --> 12:50.367
Rick Ness'
operation is shut down,

12:50.367 --> 12:53.367
waiting on new drive belts.

12:53.367 --> 12:56.967
With no time to lose,
Buzz scours the site

12:56.967 --> 12:59.400
for belts
they can repurpose.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.367
There's a bunch
of fan belts.

13:01.367 --> 13:03.233
Those are definitely no good.

13:06.834 --> 13:10.000
Oh, it definitely
ain't nothing in here.

13:12.567 --> 13:14.834
Maybe...

13:14.834 --> 13:17.400
this old wash plant
over by that wash plant.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.734
If we can run over there,
have a look at that

13:19.734 --> 13:22.133
and see maybe
there's something in there.

13:25.166 --> 13:27.800
This thing is old, knackered.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.300
Freaking trees
growing all around it.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.367
Last chance we got.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.000
I see belts.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.600
I don't know
what's in here.

13:48.433 --> 13:50.300
A little bit shorter.

13:51.767 --> 13:52.634
Hey, Rick.

13:52.634 --> 13:54.567
You wanna check
where those belts go,

13:54.567 --> 13:56.800
see how much adjustment
we got on there?

13:56.800 --> 13:59.300
There's a...
I found some 120s,

13:59.300 --> 14:01.800
they're a little bit shorter
but if we get enough adjustment,

14:01.800 --> 14:03.867
they'll probably work.

14:03.867 --> 14:06.867
Copy that.
I'll meet you at the plant.

14:06.867 --> 14:09.200
Hopefully we'll
be able to freakin'

14:09.200 --> 14:10.700
make these things work.

14:16.266 --> 14:17.734
There's one.

14:21.033 --> 14:22.467
Two belts.

14:22.467 --> 14:26.166
Not the greatest of shape
but if it can get us through,

14:26.166 --> 14:27.734
that's what matters.

14:30.900 --> 14:32.433
You have something
that works?

14:32.433 --> 14:34.333
They're a little
bit shorter but...

14:34.333 --> 14:35.634
Well,
they ain't brand new.

14:35.634 --> 14:37.634
Not the...
Not in the greatest of shape.

14:37.634 --> 14:39.100
They've been sitting there
for a while.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.433
Yeah, those are the ones...
The ones that our here--

14:40.433 --> 14:42.467
- 120s?
- 124s.

14:42.467 --> 14:44.300
That's the adjustment
rod that holds

14:44.300 --> 14:46.066
the pulleys in place, so

14:46.066 --> 14:48.533
what we'll do
is we'll let this down,

14:48.533 --> 14:50.200
which will make up
all the slack

14:50.200 --> 14:53.166
to get the belts on, hopefully.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.934
Buzz's drive belts
are too small

14:56.934 --> 14:59.934
for Monster
Red's conveyor system.

14:59.934 --> 15:03.433
Rick's plan, make adjustments
to the tension rod

15:03.433 --> 15:05.800
between the motor
and the head pulley

15:05.800 --> 15:09.467
that controls the drive belt
size and tension

15:09.467 --> 15:13.200
by compressing it
until the smaller belt fits.

15:16.767 --> 15:18.300
All right,
let's find out.

15:21.433 --> 15:22.433
Look at that.

15:23.934 --> 15:27.667
going in now.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.567
Just like that.

15:29.567 --> 15:31.834
Now we just gotta tension
it up,

15:31.834 --> 15:34.033
which is why I have
this nice come-along here.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.100
Right like that.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.700
We're adjusting
the adjustment rod right now

15:41.700 --> 15:43.567
because this is
a shorter belt.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.300
Oh, almost.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.934
Oh, man.
It's gonna be maxed out.

15:46.934 --> 15:48.500
Yeah.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.767
These are barely,
barely, barely gonna fit.

15:50.767 --> 15:52.333
- But we--
- That is right there.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.567
- Right there?
- I think, but--

15:53.567 --> 15:55.800
Let me see if I can get
the [bleep] bolt in.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.700
There we go.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.300
- Look at that.
- There it is.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.533
Hell, yeah.

16:00.533 --> 16:02.233
I mean they're shorter than
the ones that were on there,

16:02.233 --> 16:04.400
but with the amount
of adjustment we had in there,

16:04.400 --> 16:05.634
um, they fit just fine.

16:05.634 --> 16:07.033
- There's two millimeters...
- Yeah.

16:07.033 --> 16:09.133
- ...worth of space left.
- Yeah, yeah,
yeah. So...

16:09.133 --> 16:11.266
- They're maxed out.
- So we got lucky there.

16:11.266 --> 16:12.533
I mean, literally,
if they were

16:12.533 --> 16:14.467
half an inch shorter,
they wouldn't work.

16:16.467 --> 16:18.133
We're good to go.
Get the water going.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.867
Turn the plant on,
we're back up.

16:19.867 --> 16:21.634
Back up and running.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.734
Yes, there it is.

16:41.700 --> 16:42.900
Are you ready
to feed this thing?

16:42.900 --> 16:45.266
- Oh, yeah.
- Get in that loader.
Let's go.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.300
There's a lot
of problems.

16:59.300 --> 17:02.266
None of them
are particularly enjoyable.

17:02.266 --> 17:05.000
Deep in
the Klondike goldfields,

17:05.000 --> 17:08.533
28-year-old mine boss
Parker Schnabel

17:08.533 --> 17:10.500
is in trouble.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.133
I think that right now
the odds probably

17:13.133 --> 17:17.333
are not in our favor
on hitting 5,000 ounces.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.967
You know, this time
last year we probably had

17:19.967 --> 17:23.133
1,500 or 2,000 ounces.

17:23.133 --> 17:25.734
So we're also running out
of money at an alarming rate.

17:25.734 --> 17:28.300
They're spending $40,000,
$50,000 a day

17:28.300 --> 17:29.734
stripping in Dominion.

17:29.734 --> 17:31.767
Yeah.

17:31.767 --> 17:34.100
Parker has bet $15 million

17:34.100 --> 17:36.634
on buying 7,500 acres

17:36.634 --> 17:38.166
on Dominion Creek,

17:38.166 --> 17:40.734
making him one of the biggest
claim holders

17:40.734 --> 17:42.367
in the Yukon.

17:42.367 --> 17:46.367
But so far
he's only hauled in 125

17:46.367 --> 17:48.967
of the 5,000 ounce
season goal

17:48.967 --> 17:52.500
needed to keep
his business alive.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.166
So we're kind of pumping
the brakes at Dominion

17:55.166 --> 17:57.066
and don't really wanna start

17:57.066 --> 17:59.233
sluicing too early

17:59.233 --> 18:02.500
because we're in
the stripping rhythm

18:02.500 --> 18:06.567
and I don't like fighting
frost at Dominion.

18:06.567 --> 18:09.634
Our cost on ripping pay,
it would probably be like 50%

18:09.634 --> 18:11.767
more expensive
than when the sun

18:11.767 --> 18:14.500
should sit there
and thaw ground up for free.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.467
But we've spent a lot
of money and we need

18:16.467 --> 18:17.834
to get consistent gold
coming in

18:17.834 --> 18:20.433
right now down
at Ken and Stuart's.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.834
To stop bleeding cash

18:22.834 --> 18:25.634
and fund
his Dominion operation,

18:25.634 --> 18:27.934
Parker needs gold
from his only running

18:27.934 --> 18:31.133
wash plant
on Ken and Stuart's ground.

18:32.266 --> 18:33.500
Ken and Stuart's
should be good

18:33.500 --> 18:36.100
for like 1,500 ounces.

18:36.100 --> 18:38.467
Like the one thing
I can't control, right?

18:38.467 --> 18:41.066
I can't control how much
gold's in the ground,

18:41.066 --> 18:43.233
so I get nervous
or worried about things

18:43.233 --> 18:45.900
that I can't control.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.734
The unforgiving cut
should hold a third

18:48.734 --> 18:53.166
of the 1,500 ounces Parker
needs from Ken and Stuart's.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.834
The seven acre cut
is nearly finished

18:55.834 --> 18:57.634
and Parker is looking for it

18:57.634 --> 19:01.133
to deliver 350 ounces
this week.

19:01.133 --> 19:03.133
So originally
when I came down to Ken's,

19:03.133 --> 19:05.000
I had high hopes
but I'm not seeing

19:05.000 --> 19:07.634
that same kind of creamy
material on the bedrock

19:07.634 --> 19:09.467
that I'm used to seeing
last time

19:09.467 --> 19:11.634
we were down at Ken's.

19:11.634 --> 19:15.367
So I'm gonna jump out and see
what we can figure out here.

19:19.834 --> 19:22.066
So this is decomposed bedrock
right here.

19:22.066 --> 19:23.700
And you can see
how clumpy it is

19:23.700 --> 19:25.867
and how
it's pretty clay-based.

19:25.867 --> 19:28.300
So when it's going through
the plant,

19:28.300 --> 19:30.634
it generally
doesn't fully break down

19:30.634 --> 19:32.467
and the gold
can't really escape.

19:32.467 --> 19:35.367
So if I break it in half

19:35.367 --> 19:36.934
and you can kind of see

19:36.934 --> 19:38.300
the layers of the bedrock

19:38.300 --> 19:40.066
and you can see how compact

19:40.066 --> 19:42.934
decomposed bedrock really is.

19:42.934 --> 19:44.867
The unforgiven cut's gold

19:44.867 --> 19:47.734
is concentrated
between the bottom six inches

19:47.734 --> 19:51.166
of gravels and the top
six inches of bedrock.

19:51.166 --> 19:55.133
Parker would normally
sluice this whole area,

19:55.133 --> 19:57.700
but Tyson's discovered
some of the cut's bedrock

19:57.700 --> 19:59.333
is decomposed,

19:59.333 --> 20:02.166
trapping gold
in its clay-like material,

20:02.166 --> 20:05.867
making it almost impossible
for a wash plant to recover.

20:05.867 --> 20:10.634
It could be run but return
little to no gold.

20:10.634 --> 20:13.333
There's no argument
there's gold in this cut,

20:13.333 --> 20:15.133
but we just have to determine

20:15.133 --> 20:16.033
what we're gonna sluice

20:16.033 --> 20:17.066
and what
we're not gonna sluice

20:17.066 --> 20:20.133
and well, that's really
not for me to decide.

20:20.133 --> 20:22.166
That's for Parker to decide.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.934
The problem
we got right now

20:25.934 --> 20:28.333
is that down here
there's just a lot

20:28.333 --> 20:29.934
of pretty [bleep] bedrock.

20:29.934 --> 20:32.533
It makes me a little nervous.

20:32.533 --> 20:33.767
If we don't mine it out,

20:33.767 --> 20:36.166
there's like 30%
less gold maybe

20:36.166 --> 20:37.800
that we have to make
a decision

20:37.800 --> 20:39.867
about what to do
with the bedrock.

20:42.233 --> 20:44.967
30% less gold from the cut

20:44.967 --> 20:47.734
would mean a loss
of a million dollars

20:47.734 --> 20:49.967
from Parker's bottom line.

21:30.333 --> 21:32.567
We've spent a lot
of money.

21:32.567 --> 21:34.567
It'll be nice have some
money come in,

21:34.567 --> 21:36.000
end of the week,
we'll see if there's any gold

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
in this thing.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.133
We need it to be good.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.967
So we're kind of under
the gun right now.

21:42.967 --> 21:45.500
Been digging pay 12 hours
a day in the 750

21:45.500 --> 21:47.667
to try and keep sluicing.

21:56.233 --> 21:59.166
This thing sounds
like [bleep] garbage, man.

22:03.567 --> 22:06.934
Something does not sound right
on this 750.

22:08.166 --> 22:10.266
What the hell is going on?

22:22.967 --> 22:24.900
Oh, yeah.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.333
You know
that doesn't look good.

22:26.333 --> 22:27.834
It looks like
our sprocket segments

22:27.834 --> 22:31.200
are starting
to break off, so...

22:31.200 --> 22:33.133
Can't really run this thing
much more without

22:33.133 --> 22:35.300
causing any further damage.

22:37.533 --> 22:40.066
Hey, Taylor,
you got a copy, Taylor?

22:40.066 --> 22:41.500
Okay. Tyson,
what's going on?

22:41.500 --> 22:44.400
Yeah, man, the 750's down,
down at Ken's.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.900
I need you down here.

22:45.900 --> 22:47.033
Yup.
I'll be right down.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.400
Okay, I'll see you
in a bit.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.600
Thanks, man.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.467
You know this
is the last thing I need.

22:52.467 --> 22:54.667
We only have
two excavators down here.

22:54.667 --> 22:56.467
Now, one of them
is pretty much down

22:56.467 --> 22:58.200
and it's gonna be down
for a couple days.

22:58.200 --> 23:02.667
So what a [bleep] day
this has been.

23:13.634 --> 23:15.533
I had to spend a fair amount
of money right up front

23:15.533 --> 23:17.533
to get this equipment
over here from Tony

23:17.533 --> 23:19.233
and I've got Troy coming,

23:19.233 --> 23:20.700
you know,
looking for his gold too.

23:20.700 --> 23:24.133
So I gotta make sure
that we stay sluicing,
you know.

23:24.133 --> 23:26.767
Rick Ness
and his ragtag crew

23:26.767 --> 23:29.567
are racing to deliver
50 ounces

23:29.567 --> 23:30.533
by the end of the week.

23:31.634 --> 23:34.133
I gotta keep paying the plant
and I gotta make sure

23:34.133 --> 23:36.567
that the gold keeps
coming in because, you know,

23:36.567 --> 23:39.000
I've got big bills this year
and I've got a big goal.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
You know,
I owe a thousand ounces with,

23:41.000 --> 23:42.700
you know, really only
a handful of people.

23:42.700 --> 23:44.867
So, like, I said,
just keep the gold coming in

23:44.867 --> 23:48.000
all year and stay
on [bleep] track.

23:50.667 --> 23:52.767
Everybody's working
together really well.

23:52.767 --> 23:55.033
We're just trying to limit
the amount of downtime we have

23:55.033 --> 23:57.066
and get as many hours,
uh, sluicing

23:57.066 --> 23:58.867
so we can get
the most gold in the box.

24:08.734 --> 24:10.467
What the [bleep].

24:10.467 --> 24:12.233
it looks like
the feeder's down again.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.700
Hey, Rick, can I get you
to come down to the plant?

24:15.700 --> 24:17.233
It looks
like the feeder's down again.

24:17.233 --> 24:18.867
I'm coming down right now.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.634
For the second time
this week,

24:22.634 --> 24:24.934
Rick's feeder has shut down,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.800
stopping all
gold production.

24:38.667 --> 24:39.867
Holy [bleep].

24:39.867 --> 24:41.266
Everything
jammed up down there?

24:44.734 --> 24:46.133
Trying to see
if there's anything else

24:46.133 --> 24:47.634
that would be
holding it up.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.233
I think we're gonna
start with the jam.

24:50.233 --> 24:52.166
We'll get that shoveled out

24:52.166 --> 24:54.166
and then see if we
get the belt moving.

24:54.166 --> 24:55.367
Do you want me
to find a shovel?

24:55.367 --> 24:57.066
Yeah, we're gonna
need a shovel I think.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.533
Tag me in
when you get tired then.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.700
Before I get too nuts in here,
I'm gonna crawl down here

25:11.700 --> 25:13.367
to see if I see
anything jammed.

25:19.834 --> 25:24.033
Big old [bleep] rock
wedged in the tail pulley.

25:29.066 --> 25:31.800
Hopefully, I can pry
this rock out of there

25:31.800 --> 25:33.467
and get this thing back
and rolling.

25:36.133 --> 25:38.767
that is a big
that got in there.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.166
- Morgan?
- Yeah.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.867
Get that long flat bar.

25:43.867 --> 25:44.867
This one?

25:44.867 --> 25:45.967
Yes, please.

25:45.967 --> 25:47.000
Thank you.

25:47.934 --> 25:49.567
Holy [bleep].

25:51.333 --> 25:52.634
Oh, you [bleep].

25:55.900 --> 25:58.133
yes. All right.

25:59.233 --> 26:00.500
There we go.

26:02.767 --> 26:04.000
Oh, right there.

26:04.567 --> 26:06.166
There's the [bleep] problem.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.166
Now I'm stuck here.

26:13.166 --> 26:14.367
Yeah,
this is one of those moments

26:14.367 --> 26:17.100
where being such a big
guy isn't so nice.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.166
Yeah, it's not ideal.

26:18.166 --> 26:19.367
Yeah.

26:22.734 --> 26:23.834
Keep laughing,

26:23.834 --> 26:26.033
training you up here.
This is you next time.

26:26.033 --> 26:27.000
Yeah.

26:27.533 --> 26:28.700
I hope you watched.

26:30.734 --> 26:34.333
We were down
for a couple hours,
but could've been worse.

26:35.233 --> 26:37.100
As long
as everything's okay now.

26:44.367 --> 26:45.934
She spins.

26:46.900 --> 26:49.834
Monster Red
is back in action

26:49.834 --> 26:53.834
but the repeated shutdowns
may have blown Rick's chances

26:53.834 --> 26:57.400
of paying his landlord
50 ounces of gold

26:57.400 --> 26:58.767
by the end of the week.

26:58.767 --> 27:02.867
Belt's fine,
water's on, add dirt.

27:02.867 --> 27:04.300
We're back up and running.

27:05.033 --> 27:07.000
Hopefully, we get Troy paid,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.166
otherwise [bleep] catastrophe.

27:45.967 --> 27:48.433
Tony Beets
is on the brink

27:48.433 --> 27:51.600
of getting
his first gold of the year.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.467
All that's left
is to drag his shaker deck

27:54.467 --> 27:58.000
wash plant to the cut
and start sluicing.

28:24.166 --> 28:26.600
It is nice that
we got the water license.

28:26.600 --> 28:29.700
We've been waiting
to sluice here for years.

28:31.166 --> 28:34.166
Uh, we have a lot of open
ground ready to sluice.

28:34.166 --> 28:35.734
Literally, the only thing
stopping us right now

28:35.734 --> 28:37.700
is getting the plant set up.

28:38.767 --> 28:42.700
Plant in place,
Tony is one step closer

28:42.700 --> 28:45.734
to running his first
pay dirt of the season.

29:11.266 --> 29:12.634
Everything's here.
All we have to do

29:12.634 --> 29:13.900
is start
lining some [bleep] up.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.400
The Yukon's
mining authorities

29:28.400 --> 29:30.467
are responsible
for making sure

29:30.467 --> 29:33.400
all miners work
within their licenses.

29:51.934 --> 29:53.467
What the
happened?

29:55.834 --> 29:58.100
After a surprise visit

29:58.100 --> 30:00.066
from the mining authorities,

30:00.066 --> 30:02.166
Tony's race to catch gold

30:02.166 --> 30:04.433
from his Indian River claims

30:04.433 --> 30:06.734
has come
to a screeching halt.

30:19.867 --> 30:20.900
And what did we miss?

30:37.300 --> 30:39.600
Tony's disastrous error

30:39.600 --> 30:42.400
means that on his
restricted water license,

30:42.400 --> 30:46.667
he can only strip and sluice
one acre of ground,

30:46.667 --> 30:50.166
instead of the 15 acres
he believed he could.

30:51.233 --> 30:54.834
If Tony can only sluice
such a small area,

30:54.834 --> 30:58.934
Indian River will be
financially unviable.

30:59.867 --> 31:02.000
We hauled a lot
of stuff here already,

31:02.000 --> 31:03.700
we put a lot of work
and effort in it...

31:03.700 --> 31:06.433
To it, so it would be nice
to see that pay off.

31:08.133 --> 31:10.700
We usually sluice
about a month earlier
than this.

31:22.333 --> 31:24.233
If Tony can't find a solution

31:24.233 --> 31:25.400
with the authorities,

31:26.133 --> 31:27.533
his Indian River Claims

31:27.533 --> 31:29.634
will be shut down
for the season.

31:31.567 --> 31:34.900
And his only hopes
of 6,000 ounces

31:34.900 --> 31:36.567
will rest solely

31:36.567 --> 31:40.066
on his paused
operation at Paradise Hill.

31:40.066 --> 31:42.200
All I can do
is shake my head.

31:55.567 --> 31:58.634
You know, I've got four
different things I need
to be doing at once

31:58.634 --> 32:03.166
and only have one running
excavator down at Ken's.

32:03.166 --> 32:06.767
Tyson Lee's 750
excavator is broken down

32:06.767 --> 32:10.300
in the unforgiven cut,
unable to dig pay.

32:11.734 --> 32:13.967
To keep the wash plant fed,

32:13.967 --> 32:17.734
he's having to dig pay
with the smaller 480.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.033
The 480 is a great
machine but Sluicifer

32:22.033 --> 32:24.066
is a hungry beast
and it takes everything

32:24.066 --> 32:27.233
we got to keep her fed,
and that's the 750.

32:28.300 --> 32:29.967
The 750's bucket

32:29.967 --> 32:33.000
is double the size
of the 480's.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.467
If the 750
is not back in action

32:35.467 --> 32:37.400
in three hours' time,

32:37.400 --> 32:40.467
Tyson will be forced
to shut down Sluicifer.

32:41.700 --> 32:44.166
My main focus right
now is to keep Sluicifer

32:44.166 --> 32:46.266
going and trying
to avoid shutting her down

32:46.266 --> 32:48.500
'cause I can't dig
enough pay with the 480,

32:48.500 --> 32:52.233
so having to give it all
I got with this 480.

32:53.467 --> 32:55.800
To get
the 750 up and running,

32:55.800 --> 33:00.667
Tyson's called in mechanic
Taylor Matejka.

33:00.667 --> 33:02.767
Yeah, it seems like Tyson's
having a rough time down here,

33:02.767 --> 33:04.100
so I'm just gonna burn down

33:04.100 --> 33:05.133
and see
if we can help him out,

33:05.133 --> 33:06.767
and get his 750 up
and runnin'.

33:12.567 --> 33:16.033
That's Nacho right there,
my copilot.

33:17.033 --> 33:18.634
Oh, yeah.

33:18.634 --> 33:21.133
Because we got a busted
tooth on the sprocket,

33:21.133 --> 33:23.533
another one here,
so every time this thing's

33:23.533 --> 33:25.467
trying to come around
and it comes to that spot,

33:25.467 --> 33:29.100
it's skipping over the bushing
on the rail and snapping.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.000
The 750 excavator sprocket

33:33.000 --> 33:36.533
is the main gear that locks
into the track rails

33:36.533 --> 33:39.333
and drags them
forwards and backwards.

33:40.367 --> 33:42.834
Teeth have snapped
causing the sprocket

33:42.834 --> 33:45.100
to skip and lose traction.

33:45.100 --> 33:48.500
To fix it, Taylor must
uncouple the track,

33:48.500 --> 33:52.900
remove the old sprocket,
then replace it

33:52.900 --> 33:55.667
before finally
recoupling the track

33:55.667 --> 33:58.634
so it can return
to digging pay.

33:58.634 --> 34:00.900
We can't have this
excavator down, you know,

34:00.900 --> 34:02.133
more downtime we have,

34:02.133 --> 34:03.834
the less gold
we're gonna be producing.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.266
We've got a good used set,

34:05.266 --> 34:08.033
so we can bolt
them onto this machine.

34:08.033 --> 34:10.900
I think they'll be better than
running these sprockets

34:10.900 --> 34:13.300
'cause we're gonna destroy
the rails like this.

34:26.066 --> 34:27.834
Ooh.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.066
Grab a side, Liam.

34:33.934 --> 34:34.800
There we go.

34:36.066 --> 34:37.934
Sprocket revealed.

34:39.634 --> 34:41.300
The 200-pound sprocket

34:41.300 --> 34:44.600
is held onto
the excavator's drive wheel

34:44.600 --> 34:46.266
by 30 bolts.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.900
Yeah, so we're
stretched pretty thin here,

35:07.900 --> 35:09.667
you know,
we got the 750 down,

35:09.667 --> 35:12.100
we got a couple machines down
at the Dominion site,

35:12.100 --> 35:14.367
so, you know,
it's really crucial

35:14.367 --> 35:15.533
we get this thing up
and runnin'.

35:15.533 --> 35:17.867
The faster we get this done,
the faster Tyson

35:17.867 --> 35:19.567
can have
it back and be digging pay.

35:26.867 --> 35:28.033
Come forward.

35:31.100 --> 35:32.200
Down, down, down.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.533
That probably
wasn't supposed to happen.

35:38.533 --> 35:40.300
Yeah.
I just meant up a little bit,

35:40.300 --> 35:42.100
but I was not probably
very clear there.

35:42.500 --> 35:43.867
So it's okay.

35:43.867 --> 35:45.066
We'll go grab
that loader there

35:45.066 --> 35:47.100
and we'll just pull her back
the old-fashioned way.

35:53.333 --> 35:54.600
First gear, eh?

36:05.233 --> 36:06.800
Just trying
to land one of the bushings

36:06.800 --> 36:08.300
into a sprocket link

36:08.300 --> 36:09.734
so that it
doesn't roll back on us,

36:09.734 --> 36:12.033
it needs to be held in
by the...

36:12.033 --> 36:13.200
by the sprocket or else,

36:13.200 --> 36:14.734
we're gonna
lose the track again.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.166
Lower down nice and slow.

36:17.166 --> 36:18.367
A little more.

36:19.934 --> 36:20.934
Okay.

36:31.066 --> 36:34.033
All we need to do
is that.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.667
Strong man.

37:11.200 --> 37:12.600
Yeah, she's all
looking good,

37:12.600 --> 37:14.867
we got the sprockets on,
pads are on.

37:14.867 --> 37:18.300
We're just snug the tracks up
and Tyson come take her away.

37:19.867 --> 37:21.600
Tyson, got a copy?
Tyson.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.433
Yup. What's up, man?

37:23.433 --> 37:24.934
Hey. We're just wrapping up

37:24.934 --> 37:28.000
your 750 here
in the second cut.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.567
Um...

37:29.567 --> 37:31.600
It'll be good to go
whenever you need it.

37:34.467 --> 37:36.700
You know,
Taylor really pulled through
for me on this one.

37:36.700 --> 37:39.734
The 750 being back up
and going means

37:39.734 --> 37:41.800
I can keep Sluicifer going
and I was thinking

37:41.800 --> 37:43.967
I was gonna have
to shut it down this afternoon

37:43.967 --> 37:45.533
'cause we're
really running out of pay.

37:45.533 --> 37:48.433
So that's the best news
I could've gotten.

37:48.433 --> 37:49.767
You're the man, T.

37:59.634 --> 38:01.333
I'm sure anyone
who's watched the show

38:01.333 --> 38:03.533
might know who Nacho is.

38:03.533 --> 38:06.166
We got Nacho four years
ago when he was a pup.

38:06.166 --> 38:07.800
I don't wanna be biased

38:07.800 --> 38:11.100
but I think he's kind
of the mascot around here.

38:11.100 --> 38:14.967
So we've been able to teach
him lots of tricks.

38:14.967 --> 38:16.266
We've got a bit of steak here.

38:18.033 --> 38:19.133
You see what we got?

38:19.133 --> 38:21.800
Now, you're fired up,
aren't you?

38:21.800 --> 38:23.266
Start with a little high-five.

38:25.266 --> 38:26.533
Okay.

38:26.533 --> 38:27.700
Kiss.

38:27.700 --> 38:30.166
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

38:30.166 --> 38:31.333
Okay. Turn around.

38:31.333 --> 38:33.266
- Oh.
- Ooh.

38:33.266 --> 38:34.133
Stand up.

38:35.634 --> 38:36.700
Lay down.

38:36.700 --> 38:38.634
Roll over. There you go.

38:38.634 --> 38:41.567
Maybe there's a grand finale
here if he does it.

38:41.567 --> 38:43.834
Nacho, hands up.

38:44.900 --> 38:46.166
Bang.

38:47.367 --> 38:48.767
How about a round
of applause for Nacho?

38:48.767 --> 38:50.734
- Yay, Nacho!
- This is our...

38:51.867 --> 38:53.100
That's Nacho right there.

39:00.634 --> 39:02.233
But it would be
nice to have, like,

39:02.233 --> 39:05.500
one week and I'm probably
jinxing us right now,

39:05.500 --> 39:09.667
but one week where something
big doesn't happen, you know.

39:09.667 --> 39:11.867
I hope there's enough gold
to at least pay for the belt.

39:11.867 --> 39:13.734
I hope there's enough
gold to pay for snacks

39:13.734 --> 39:14.900
'cause we're running out.

39:14.900 --> 39:16.333
- Yeah.
- And I get cranky.

39:16.333 --> 39:18.467
At Lower Duncan Creek,

39:18.467 --> 39:20.867
the Ness crew
are about to find out

39:20.867 --> 39:24.066
if they've scraped
together enough gold

39:24.066 --> 39:28.800
for Rick to pay landlord
Troy Taylor his 50 ounces.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.867
Thanks.

39:30.700 --> 39:31.734
Hey, dog.

39:34.333 --> 39:35.834
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hi.

39:35.834 --> 39:36.767
How is she looking?

39:36.767 --> 39:37.900
A little light.

39:37.900 --> 39:39.233
A little light?

39:39.233 --> 39:40.200
Yeah.

39:40.200 --> 39:42.233
I'm still a big fan
in any gold

39:42.233 --> 39:43.734
is good gold, so...

39:43.734 --> 39:45.066
Two point.

39:48.900 --> 39:51.667
Troy showed up
asking for 50 ounces,

39:51.667 --> 39:53.767
so that means we gotta get
a lot of gold in.

39:55.233 --> 39:57.066
I'm so ready
to weigh this gold.

39:57.066 --> 39:59.300
- Let's weigh
some gold.
- Hell yeah.

39:59.300 --> 40:01.200
After paying bills,

40:01.200 --> 40:05.033
Rick has only 36 ounces
of gold left.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.367
To pay Troy 50,

40:07.367 --> 40:10.667
he needs at least
another 14 ounces.

40:10.667 --> 40:14.533
If he's short,
Rick risks losing his claim.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.567
All right. You ready?

40:16.567 --> 40:17.500
I'm ready.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.200
We've got...

40:19.200 --> 40:20.066
Yeah.

40:20.066 --> 40:22.934
We got 2, 4,

40:22.934 --> 40:26.233
6, 7, 8, 10, 12.

40:26.233 --> 40:29.667
Ooh, 15.2.

40:29.667 --> 40:31.767
15.24.

40:31.767 --> 40:34.533
Worth $30,000,

40:34.533 --> 40:38.967
just enough to hit the 50
Rick needs to pay Troy.

40:40.300 --> 40:41.800
We're over that hundred mark.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.734
It's not a great gold weigh,
but at least I've got enough,

40:43.734 --> 40:45.734
uh, to pay off
Troy Taylor for now, right?

40:45.734 --> 40:46.934
Keeps us going.

40:46.934 --> 40:49.834
And after Troy's paid,
we're kinda back at zero.

40:49.834 --> 40:50.767
Mmm-hmm.

40:50.767 --> 40:53.033
But I'll take
zero over a negative.

40:53.033 --> 40:54.367
Yeah.

40:54.367 --> 40:55.800
Yeah, we're still
moving forward.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.400
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.433
Maybe back to zero,
but hey,

40:59.433 --> 41:02.100
at least we got lots
of ground to play with...

41:02.100 --> 41:04.000
- Yeah.
- ...all our
equipment's here.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.600
Everything is running.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.600
So it won't be hard
to get back to that spot.

41:07.600 --> 41:08.533
Exactly.

41:08.533 --> 41:09.967
That's how I feel.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.634
I gotta go put 50
ounces in the jar

41:11.634 --> 41:13.200
and get this over
to Troy, so...

41:14.433 --> 41:15.834
Thanks for the week, guys.

41:15.834 --> 41:17.033
You're the best.

41:24.033 --> 41:25.433
- How's it going, Troy?
- Hey, Rick.

41:25.433 --> 41:26.500
- How are you doing?
- Good.

41:26.500 --> 41:27.667
Caught you cutting
some firewood.

41:27.667 --> 41:28.767
Oh, yeah.

41:28.767 --> 41:29.900
Just guess
we got to get at her.

41:29.900 --> 41:30.867
Yeah, yeah.

41:30.867 --> 41:33.133
Well, I got
you the 50 ounces, Troy.

41:33.133 --> 41:34.066
Thanks, Rick.

41:34.066 --> 41:35.100
- This looks good.
- Yup.

41:35.100 --> 41:36.133
It's nice and clean.

41:36.133 --> 41:37.233
Appreciate that.

41:37.233 --> 41:39.433
Yeah. We had a rough week.

41:39.433 --> 41:41.367
Had some... Had some
downtime at the plant,

41:41.367 --> 41:43.367
but I was able to scrape
up the 50 ounces.

41:43.367 --> 41:44.800
See, you know, it's just...

41:44.800 --> 41:46.800
After last year, I'm always
a little bit on edge.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.133
- So this is a huge...
- I hear you.

41:48.133 --> 41:49.734
- ...step forward, so...
- Yeah.

41:49.734 --> 41:50.967
- ...appreciate it.
- Good.

41:50.967 --> 41:52.033
Yeah, thank you
for working with me.

41:52.033 --> 41:52.934
Oh, yeah.

41:52.934 --> 41:54.166
And I'll
keep the gold coming in.

41:54.166 --> 41:55.967
- You bet. Cool.
- All right.

41:55.967 --> 41:57.333
- Right on.
- Thanks, Troy.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.800
Now that
Rick has paid off

41:59.800 --> 42:02.900
some of the money
he owes Troy,

42:02.900 --> 42:05.867
he can refocus
on his 1,000-ounce goal

42:05.867 --> 42:09.567
and getting
his life back on track.

42:09.567 --> 42:12.000
It's nice to give Troy some
of the gold that I owe him.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.800
We got a long ways
to go but, you know,

42:13.800 --> 42:15.600
next week, we're just
gonna hit it harder.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.433
- What's happening?
- Hey, hey.

42:28.433 --> 42:29.433
Yo, yo.

42:29.433 --> 42:30.667
How was your day?

42:30.667 --> 42:32.233
Busy.

42:32.233 --> 42:34.400
- Very busy.
- Seems like you're always
busy now.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.166
Yeah.

42:36.166 --> 42:38.433
Nearly two months
into the season,

42:38.433 --> 42:42.800
Parker's crew have
banked just 125 ounces.

42:45.033 --> 42:47.133
Down at Ken's,
there's been just a lot

42:47.133 --> 42:49.800
of decomposed bedrock
and it's totally changed pace

42:49.800 --> 42:51.100
from two years ago
when we were down there.

42:51.100 --> 42:52.767
You're flying
through that, huh?

42:52.767 --> 42:54.800
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.600
Well, at least the 750
is back up and going

42:56.600 --> 42:58.133
so you got that to use again.

42:58.133 --> 43:00.166
Yeah, Taylor
and he found some old

43:00.166 --> 43:03.233
sprocket segments in the yard,
so he saved the day,

43:03.233 --> 43:05.734
that's for sure 'cause
if we were waiting for those,

43:05.734 --> 43:08.467
I'd be calling you guys
and seeing if there's any
other equipment.

43:09.533 --> 43:11.333
Well, that's why we
don't throw anything away.

43:11.333 --> 43:13.166
Well, how do we do,
Doumitt?

43:13.166 --> 43:14.333
What do we got?

43:14.333 --> 43:16.333
Well, it's a two-fister
that's for sure.

43:16.333 --> 43:17.266
Oh, buddy.

43:18.600 --> 43:19.533
You ready?

43:19.533 --> 43:20.967
Oh, yeah. Looks heavy.

43:20.967 --> 43:22.266
It is heavy.

43:22.266 --> 43:24.934
Parker needs
the unforgiven cut

43:24.934 --> 43:27.834
to deliver 350 ounces.

43:27.834 --> 43:29.000
Here we go.

43:29.433 --> 43:31.567
20, 40,

43:31.567 --> 43:32.934
80,

43:33.734 --> 43:36.500
100, 140,

43:36.500 --> 43:37.900
180.

43:37.900 --> 43:39.700
210,

43:39.700 --> 43:41.967
230, 240.

43:42.734 --> 43:45.266
262.95.

43:45.266 --> 43:48.967
Worth over
half a million dollars.

43:48.967 --> 43:53.066
But nearly 100 ounces
short of Parker's target.

43:53.066 --> 43:57.700
That puts us
a season total
of 387.95,

43:57.700 --> 43:59.834
almost 400 ounces.

43:59.834 --> 44:02.200
You gotta get to 400
before you get to 5,000.

44:02.200 --> 44:03.066
Yeah.

44:03.066 --> 44:04.500
We're at the bottom
of Mount Everest

44:04.500 --> 44:06.600
with a chisel and a hammer.

44:09.100 --> 44:11.700
If there's decomposed
bedrock in that cut,

44:11.700 --> 44:13.333
do you guys think we're
gonna hit our 1,500

44:13.333 --> 44:15.467
ounces that we want
out at Ken's or...

44:15.467 --> 44:16.567
No, you won't.

44:16.567 --> 44:18.000
You don't think so?

44:18.734 --> 44:20.500
Not if it stays like that.

44:20.500 --> 44:23.567
What are you hoping for then
if it stays decomposed?

44:23.567 --> 44:24.567
I don't know.

44:24.567 --> 44:27.567
I don't know what
to expect, honestly.

44:27.567 --> 44:30.634
I also don't like how big
a hole we're in right now.

44:30.634 --> 44:31.800
Yeah.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.500
Financially speaking.

44:33.500 --> 44:34.934
- I gotta run.
- Okay.

44:34.934 --> 44:36.767
- Thanks, guys.
- Yup. Later.

44:36.767 --> 44:37.700
All righty.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.533
Just kinda gotta
reprogram and figure out

44:41.533 --> 44:43.400
where we can get
our 5,000 ounces from

44:43.400 --> 44:45.200
if it's not down at Ken's.

44:47.467 --> 44:49.300
I mean, that was
a pretty damn good cleanup

44:49.300 --> 44:50.834
for Sluicifer down there.

44:50.834 --> 44:52.233
But at the end of the day,

44:52.233 --> 44:53.567
you can see the look
on Parker's face.

44:53.567 --> 44:55.333
We're spending more money
than we're making

44:55.333 --> 44:57.133
and, you know,
we just gotta see

44:57.133 --> 44:59.100
what this ground up
here at Dominion holds,

44:59.100 --> 45:01.734
and hopefully,
we find out here pretty soon.
