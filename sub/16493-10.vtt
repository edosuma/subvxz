WEBVTT

00:05.706 --> 00:06.539
Here we are.

00:06.622 --> 00:08.831
Okay, kids, remember,

00:08.914 --> 00:10.039
we're just a phone call away

00:10.123 --> 00:11.330
at the Outlet Mall.

00:11.414 --> 00:13.372
We only have to pay half
price when it breaks.

00:13.455 --> 00:14.580
Thanks, Milo's mom and dad.

00:14.664 --> 00:15.998
-Thanks, guys, have a good time.
-So long.

00:17.706 --> 00:19.539
Oh, didn't realize we still had her.

00:19.622 --> 00:23.330
Bye, Sara, be sure to look up
from your phone once in a while.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.164
Ah, the great outdoors.

00:25.248 --> 00:27.872
The sky is blue,
the fields are wide open...

00:27.956 --> 00:29.789
The bargains are close by.

00:29.872 --> 00:31.206
[Brigette] You kids have fun.

00:31.289 --> 00:33.081
It's just so peaceful.

00:33.164 --> 00:34.455
[whistles]

00:34.539 --> 00:37.123
Welcome to the Nowhere
Desert Dude Ranch.

00:37.206 --> 00:40.497
-Where you will experience...
-[airplane engines roaring]

00:45.248 --> 00:47.914
The serenity of the wild frontier.

00:50.956 --> 00:52.081
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh!

00:52.206 --> 00:54.580
I think this is the
undiscovered shooting location

00:54.664 --> 00:57.747
of episode 576 of Dr. Zone.

00:57.831 --> 00:58.956
See.

01:00.580 --> 01:03.914
Definitely a similar beaut shaped beaut.

01:03.998 --> 01:05.789
Am I pronouncing that correctly?

01:05.872 --> 01:09.414
I can't wait to see what my fellow
Dr. Zone fans have to say about this.

01:09.497 --> 01:11.956
Ah, Dr. Zone fan.

01:12.039 --> 01:14.622
You're gonna wanna check
out that corral over there.

01:14.706 --> 01:17.372
Awesome! Oh, I gotta document this.

01:17.455 --> 01:18.664
I'll find you later.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.622
-Use helmets.
-Got 'em.

01:22.706 --> 01:24.956
Oh, I mean on the horses.

01:25.039 --> 01:27.248
-Do they even make helmets for...
-Got 'em.

01:27.330 --> 01:28.664
[cowboy] Those are our three best horses.

01:28.998 --> 01:32.580
Princess, Buttercup and Psycho.

01:33.747 --> 01:37.248
-[nieghing]
-Whoa, boy!

01:37.330 --> 01:40.081
Any chance of us getting a calmer horse?

01:40.164 --> 01:42.789
Well, Psycho there is
usually our calmest horse.

01:42.872 --> 01:45.872
That's why we named him
Psycho, for the irony.

01:45.956 --> 01:47.289
We crack ourselves up.

01:47.372 --> 01:49.956
Not that I don't enjoy
danger, which I don't,

01:50.039 --> 01:52.081
but, do they have other stuff to do here?

01:52.164 --> 01:56.248
Like other stuff that we might
not necessarily get injured doing.

01:56.330 --> 01:57.914
-Archery, white water rafting...
-No...

01:57.998 --> 01:59.372
-...zip lining, cattle roping...
-No...

01:59.455 --> 02:02.248
-...straws making...
-Oh, that sounds fun.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.956
On an open bonfire.

02:04.039 --> 02:06.622
Okay... Maybe there's a hayride?

02:06.706 --> 02:09.081
It goes around the open bonfire.

02:09.164 --> 02:11.081
All right, horseback riding, it is.

02:11.164 --> 02:12.330
I'm ready!

02:15.039 --> 02:17.998
-[neighing]
-Whoa, boy! What's that up ahead?

02:21.081 --> 02:24.998
You know, every time a masked bandit
comes furiously charging towards me

02:25.081 --> 02:27.914
-I'd like to take a deep... Whoa!
-[neighs]

02:28.914 --> 02:30.123
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

02:33.081 --> 02:34.372
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

02:34.455 --> 02:35.747
Look out! Stop, stop, stop.

02:37.372 --> 02:39.039
[screaming]

02:41.372 --> 02:42.289
[yells]

02:42.372 --> 02:44.455
It's a good thing I
had the lacrosse stick.

02:46.248 --> 02:49.372
What is a masked bandit
even doing on a dude ranch?

02:49.455 --> 02:51.747
Well, he can't get away with
that at the Outlet Mall.

02:52.123 --> 02:54.039
[neighing]

02:56.580 --> 02:58.372
[heart beating rapidly]

02:58.455 --> 03:01.414
Hey, I'm Jackie.
I pull that with all our guests.

03:01.497 --> 03:02.956
Did I get your hearts racing?

03:03.039 --> 03:04.497
Yes, indeed. Sure did.

03:04.580 --> 03:05.706
[chuckles] A little.

03:05.789 --> 03:07.248
That's how I like it.

03:07.330 --> 03:09.914
After all, I am the
great-great-great-great-granddaughter

03:09.998 --> 03:12.039
of Calamity Jane.

03:12.123 --> 03:14.831
Really? I am the
great-great-great-great-grandson

03:14.914 --> 03:16.081
of the original Murphy.

03:16.164 --> 03:17.789
-Of Murphy's Law.
-Never heard of it.

03:17.872 --> 03:19.039
-Really?
-Yeah.

03:19.123 --> 03:20.872
I make a point of not knowing any laws.

03:20.956 --> 03:23.497
Well, it just means that,
anything that can go wrong,

03:23.580 --> 03:24.872
will go wrong.

03:24.956 --> 03:26.206
-Around me.
-Awesome.

03:26.330 --> 03:28.164
Do you guys want my version of the tour?

03:28.248 --> 03:30.206
[chuckles] I don't know.

03:30.289 --> 03:31.747
The two of us together?

03:31.831 --> 03:35.081
Yeah, we already hit our danger
quota, right, Zack?

03:39.539 --> 03:41.123
I wasn't saying that.
Why would I say that?

03:41.206 --> 03:43.455
I love danger. Danger is in my blood.

03:43.539 --> 03:46.539
It's my fuel. Danger is my middle name.

03:46.622 --> 03:48.123
Well, it's Milo's middle name.

03:48.206 --> 03:50.622
But it could be my middle
name, I could change it.

03:50.998 --> 03:51.914
[chuckling]

03:51.998 --> 03:54.372
I'm afraid we've lost him.

03:57.622 --> 03:59.372
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:59.455 --> 04:02.372
I think this is the exact
pasture they used.

04:02.455 --> 04:04.956
Oh, that is the exact hay!

04:05.039 --> 04:07.289
Oh, those are the exact cows.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.580
-[Sara mooing]
-[cows mooing]

04:09.664 --> 04:12.372
Yep, yep, Hey, I know you guys.
Say, "Cheese."

04:12.455 --> 04:13.956
Or, maybe that's rude to say to a cow.

04:14.039 --> 04:16.081
[boy] Yeah, they look like the same cows.

04:16.164 --> 04:18.206
We saw your post, we came right away.

04:18.289 --> 04:21.414
Of course, as the official
moderators of the Dr. Zone fan site,

04:21.497 --> 04:24.956
we will have to verify the
authenticity before we post anything.

04:25.039 --> 04:27.039
Hey, guys! Wait, I thought...

04:27.123 --> 04:28.248
I thought we were dressing up.

04:31.039 --> 04:33.789
So, what school do you go to?
What grade are you in?

04:33.872 --> 04:35.414
I've gone to a lot of
different schools, so...

04:35.497 --> 04:39.039
Well, I was being home
schooled, but I got kicked out.

04:39.123 --> 04:40.248
-Rattle snake?
-Oh, sure.

04:40.330 --> 04:43.248
Don't suck on it.
There's still venom in those fangs.

04:43.330 --> 04:46.998
Oh, good thing you said something...
[imitates munching]

04:47.081 --> 04:48.622
I don't know if we should go up here.

04:48.706 --> 04:49.539
Why not?

04:49.622 --> 04:51.580
Because all these signs
say don't go up here.

04:51.664 --> 04:52.998
Rock slide possible.

04:53.081 --> 04:54.622
Well, Zack doesn't seem worried.

04:54.664 --> 04:56.123
And he's the cautious one.

04:56.206 --> 04:57.956
Oh, don't worry about the signs.

04:58.039 --> 04:59.497
They just say possible.

04:59.580 --> 05:02.330
How often does the worst thing
that can happen, actually happen?

05:02.414 --> 05:03.789
Yeah, we'll be fine.

05:13.081 --> 05:14.622
[all screaming]

05:14.706 --> 05:16.081
[Zack] Oh, no!

05:17.081 --> 05:18.622
Out on the branch.

05:20.998 --> 05:23.914
[screaming]

05:23.998 --> 05:27.206
[exclaims] I can't believe the
rock slide actually happened.

05:27.289 --> 05:29.706
-My beaut believes it.
-What a rush!

05:33.248 --> 05:34.872
So, back to camp for s'mores?

05:34.956 --> 05:37.872
No, we got more adventuring to do.

05:37.956 --> 05:39.998
Yeah, more that.

05:40.081 --> 05:41.455
Scorpion pop?
You can suck on this one.

05:41.539 --> 05:43.747
Oh! [chuckles nervously]

05:44.289 --> 05:45.956
[exclaiming]

05:48.123 --> 05:50.039
I was hoping the cliff was the finale.

05:50.123 --> 05:53.414
You can't keep danger
away but why seek it out?

05:53.497 --> 05:56.039
Oh, I remember when Zack
used to say stuff like that.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.206
Yeah, way back this morning.

06:00.706 --> 06:03.164
Hey, boy band, a little more wrist
if you wanna rope that dummy.

06:06.039 --> 06:07.622
Way to go, danger zone.

06:07.706 --> 06:08.914
I work with rope a lot.

06:08.998 --> 06:11.580
[Melissa] Uh, Milo, that's no dummy.

06:11.664 --> 06:14.330
Now, this is a rodeo.

06:14.414 --> 06:15.956
-Everyone split up.
-[roars]

06:18.414 --> 06:19.998
Whoa!

06:24.289 --> 06:25.622
[snarls]

06:36.081 --> 06:39.081
[scoffs] That was a close call.

06:39.164 --> 06:40.956
Although, I'm sure he's harmless.

06:41.039 --> 06:42.081
Nope, he's a killer.

06:42.164 --> 06:43.914
But I assumed the shackles would hold him.

06:43.998 --> 06:46.248
Well, you know what
they say about assuming.

06:46.330 --> 06:48.372
Makes a bull's lunch out of you and me.

06:48.455 --> 06:51.372
-Next activity!
-Yeah! I can't wait.

06:51.455 --> 06:54.622
Looks like one dummy got
roped for the whole afternoon.

06:55.330 --> 06:57.039
[cameras clicking]

07:02.081 --> 07:03.081
Now, me in front of it.

07:03.164 --> 07:04.039
Now, me in front of it.

07:04.123 --> 07:05.914
Now, me in front of it.

07:09.372 --> 07:12.123
Are you sure?
I mean this could be any wall.

07:12.206 --> 07:15.123
Josh, why can't you accept it?
This is the actual wall.

07:15.206 --> 07:18.289
Remember what the wall was like,
there at the background, out of focus.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.081
The wall.

07:21.706 --> 07:24.289
Here's some of that serenity
we were talking about.

07:24.372 --> 07:25.622
I thought you'd like it.

07:25.706 --> 07:28.872
That is so thoughtful of you.

07:30.664 --> 07:33.123
Are those storm clouds
gonna be a problem?

07:33.206 --> 07:34.622
Maybe we shouldn't tempt fate.

07:34.706 --> 07:36.206
Well, you know what they say.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.123
Tempting fate is like a rainbow.

07:38.206 --> 07:40.956
It's too beautiful,
knocks you upside down like a leprechaun.

07:41.039 --> 07:42.497
No one has ever said that.

07:42.580 --> 07:45.455
-[thunder rumbling]
-Let's try to get to shore before...

07:45.539 --> 07:47.497
-It starts raining.
-[scoffs] No big.

07:47.580 --> 07:51.081
Deal breaker! [screams]

07:51.164 --> 07:54.164
Steering wheel, piggy bank...
Look out, sharp boulder.

07:54.248 --> 07:57.622
Whoo-hoo. Hey, this is a blast!

07:57.706 --> 08:00.164
No, this is not a blast!

08:00.248 --> 08:02.081
Everyone, stay close.

08:02.164 --> 08:03.123
Jackie, the waterfall.

08:04.580 --> 08:07.164
Whoa! Whoa!

08:09.164 --> 08:10.539
Help!

08:10.622 --> 08:12.081
[shatters]

08:15.248 --> 08:17.539
Hold on, I've got you...

08:18.206 --> 08:21.164
[screaming]

08:25.998 --> 08:27.081
-Thanks, Milo.
-Yeah, thanks.

08:27.164 --> 08:28.914
Cool, time for target practice.

08:28.998 --> 08:31.539
Last one there is the target.

08:31.622 --> 08:34.123
Yeah, so...

08:34.206 --> 08:36.123
That girl's crazy, right?

08:36.206 --> 08:38.039
-Welcome back.
-Thank goodness.

08:38.123 --> 08:42.039
I guess I just wasn't seeing
Jackie as she really is.

08:42.123 --> 08:43.372
Well, to be fair,

08:43.455 --> 08:45.664
when she was first charging at
us, with a bandit mask on,

08:45.747 --> 08:47.956
she seemed, uh, less insane.

08:48.039 --> 08:50.123
Nah, she was always crazy.

08:53.289 --> 08:56.372
And though, some of you
may have doubted me,

08:56.455 --> 08:59.998
Josh, my instincts never let me down.

09:00.081 --> 09:03.372
I knew this was the very dirt
where they shot Dr. Zone.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.289
Shot him? No, sir.

09:05.372 --> 09:08.206
Dr. Zone's our favorite old race horse.

09:08.289 --> 09:09.414
We'd never shoot him.

09:09.497 --> 09:11.497
Though he is getting long in the tooth.

09:11.580 --> 09:13.123
[neighs weakly]

09:13.206 --> 09:14.330
-What?
-The horse?

09:14.414 --> 09:17.248
Oh, but he said Dr. Zone,
I just assumed...

09:17.330 --> 09:20.414
Wait, I thought this was the
dirt, you mean, this is just dirt?

09:20.497 --> 09:23.248
Thanks for wasting our time, Sara.

09:23.330 --> 09:27.248
Wait, wait! A racehorse named Dr. Zone.

09:27.330 --> 09:30.164
That's worth noting, right? [groans]

09:30.248 --> 09:32.956
Photo-op.

09:34.164 --> 09:35.248
[sighs]

09:36.622 --> 09:39.372
Well, that was a delightful day.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.123
Loaner clothes, after
disaster ruined yours?

09:43.206 --> 09:45.289
Yep. Stuff you broke and had to buy?

09:45.372 --> 09:48.248
Yep. Thankfully at half price.

09:48.330 --> 09:51.330
-Bye, boy band.
-Bye, cool ranch. Stay safe.

09:51.414 --> 09:53.164
Not likely.

09:56.998 --> 09:58.330
-Sara!
-[gasps]

09:58.414 --> 10:02.039
Why do I keep forgetting about her?

10:02.123 --> 10:06.164
Well, I guess the shooting
location of episode 576,

10:06.248 --> 10:08.330
remains an unsolved mystery.

10:08.414 --> 10:11.206
Oh, no, they filmed that episode here.

10:11.289 --> 10:13.580
Why do you think we named
this horse Dr. Zone?
