WEBVTT

01:17.327 --> 01:18.328
Wow.

01:19.370 --> 01:21.122
I thought you were just power-washing.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.084
I was, but that water pressure
stripped off way more than dirt.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.419
Yeah. Copy that.

01:28.004 --> 01:33.301
-So everything end up okay with your dad?
-Uh-huh.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.011
What about Charmaine?

01:35.887 --> 01:37.055
It's all good.

01:38.556 --> 01:40.725
-Brady?
-What's with all the questions?

01:40.809 --> 01:43.103
You seem a little intense this morning.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.939
No, I'm just focused.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.777
Listen, man, I'm not trying to give you
a hard time or anything.

01:50.860 --> 01:54.489
You know, you've been real supportive
about Paige and Christopher.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.157
You don't gotta hold it all in.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.492
I'm not.

01:57.992 --> 02:00.745
-There's no judgment.
-Hey, I appreciate that.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.790
I'm good here, man.
You can go back inside.

02:03.873 --> 02:04.707
Okay.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.338
Is there anything else I can do?

02:10.421 --> 02:12.757
Burger and a cold beer at lunch
would be good.

02:14.634 --> 02:17.220
-You got it.
-Thanks, man.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.352
-Good morning.
-Hey, there. Coffee's fresh.

02:24.435 --> 02:25.645
Oh, thanks.

02:25.728 --> 02:28.148
Doc's gotten better at that,
but it's usually my job.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.275
Can I get you a cup? How do you take it?

02:30.358 --> 02:33.153
You know what? I'm actually
trying to cut back. But thank you.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.362
It smells delicious.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.865
I wanted to say thank you for last night.

02:36.948 --> 02:40.034
I had a lot of fun, and I hope
I didn't overstay my welcome.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.953
No. No, not at all. We had a great time.

02:42.036 --> 02:44.831
I gotta hand it to Jack.
He put up with a lot of shop talk.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.166
Oh, he said he had fun.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.336
Hey, did you hear back
about the man you helped?

02:50.420 --> 02:55.550
Yes, I did. Um, the hospital called
and he passed away.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.927
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.388
You know, I'm surprised
that they called you, though.

03:00.471 --> 03:05.560
What happened was, um, the paramedics
gave the hospital my name and number

03:05.643 --> 03:07.854
and they thought I was his daughter.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.148
The hospital is trying
to locate the next of kin,

03:10.231 --> 03:13.568
-but if they can't find anybody...
-It's an unmarked grave.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.362
Poor Jack, I kind of ended up, um...

03:17.071 --> 03:20.450
spinning out on him
and it was a long night.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.745
Sorry, is this an overshare?
Am I oversharing?

03:23.828 --> 03:27.665
No, not at all. You're just being human.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.584
Yeah, okay.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.135
Hey, Brie, can you grab me
a few bandages?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.054
I think I left some out there.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.055
Yeah.

04:20.635 --> 04:21.636
What the hell?

04:24.931 --> 04:28.142
You don't get it. It's not so clear-cut.
I can't go back to jail.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.813
-So you're just gonna leave?
-No. I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.649
Okay, so you're just gonna become
a fugitive instead?

04:34.732 --> 04:36.484
Brie, I am innocent, you know this.

04:36.567 --> 04:39.946
Yeah, I do. I also know that running
is only gonna make you look guilty.

04:40.029 --> 04:41.281
I can't stay here!

04:43.366 --> 04:46.869
Calvin, the guy I used to work for,
he wants something from me that I can't--

04:46.953 --> 04:48.246
I won't give him.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.707
Yeah, I know who Calvin is.

04:50.790 --> 04:51.624
How?

04:51.708 --> 04:55.545
After I left the hospital,
he threatened me in the parking lot.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.676
-What do you mean he threatened you?
-He said as long as you go back

05:01.759 --> 05:03.428
to working for him...

05:04.637 --> 05:06.556
nothing bad would happen to me.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.144
-I swear to God, I'm gonna kill him.
-No, no.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.688
Going after Calvin
is only gonna make things worse.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.733
I don't care. He needs to know
if he even looks at you, he's dead.

05:16.816 --> 05:17.859
Brady, stop.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.737
That is not how we're going to win.

05:21.529 --> 05:22.739
We're gonna set a trap.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.784
What do you mean, a trap?

05:26.868 --> 05:31.748
First, I need you to tell me everything
you know about Emerald Lumber.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.585
All right.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.589
All right, but I want to get out of here.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.341
I'm sick of being cooped up.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.968
Let's go for a ride. Okay?

05:45.762 --> 05:46.596
Yeah.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.812
-Hey, Preach.
-Hey.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.981
Hey, is Jack around?

05:57.065 --> 05:58.816
Yeah, he's out front.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.817
Awesome.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.612
Listen, I want to take him
somewhere special this afternoon.

06:02.695 --> 06:03.780
Do you have any ideas?

06:03.863 --> 06:04.906
What's the occasion?

06:04.989 --> 06:07.742
Well, I just want to give him a break.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.452
And I want it to be a surprise.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.580
Okay. Well, you know,
there's fishing at Whispering Rock.

06:12.663 --> 06:16.709
It is a beautiful, secluded island.
You two could spend the night.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.961
Oh, yes. That sounds perfect.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.047
-Can you cover the bar?
-Yeah, absolutely.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.674
But the island is kind of remote.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.386
My buddy Reuben owns a fishing boat
docked at the marina.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.888
-He may be able to run you two over there.
-Awesome.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.390
Just let me know how much.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.725
Yeah, don't worry about it.
He owes me a favor.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.352
-Oh, okay.

06:35.436 --> 06:36.813
There you go. You are in luck.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.816
He can do it,
but you need to meet him at 4:00,

06:39.899 --> 06:41.442
which means leaving here around 2:00.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.319
2:00, no problem.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.946
-Thanks for the hook-up.
-Uh-uh.

06:45.029 --> 06:47.031
No, no, no. Don't thank me yet,

06:47.115 --> 06:50.493
because you still need to find a way
to pry Jack away from painting.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.871
That is a man who finishes what he starts.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.581
Challenge accepted.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.666
Good luck.

06:56.749 --> 06:57.667
Thank you.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.509
You missed a spot.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.594
Oh, you're funny.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.014
-Hey.
-Hey. Oh!

07:17.478 --> 07:21.524
Um... Thank you for this.
The engraving is beautiful.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.025
It's not too over-the-top?

07:23.109 --> 07:27.738
What, our initials together?
No, it's so sweet. I love it.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.158
When did you even find time to do this?

07:30.241 --> 07:31.784
I bought it a while back.

07:32.743 --> 07:36.372
Just kept it for a rainy day
and I figured last night qualified.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.249
Yeah.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.793
Sorry, I'm...

07:41.752 --> 07:43.337
surprised I got so emotional.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.673
No. Hey, come on.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.467
It's okay, I get it.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.888
I just can't stop thinking
about that stillborn...

07:53.431 --> 07:54.807
Oh, babe.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.937
I was doing so good
trying to stay positive.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.648
I just don't want that to happen to us.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.150
Hey, it's not.

08:05.067 --> 08:05.902
Okay.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.654
-Yeah.
-And this...

08:08.738 --> 08:11.407
is why you gotta tell me sooner.
I wanna be there for you.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.243
-I know, but you were having a bad day.
-I don't care.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.830
I told you, if anything ever upsets you,
I wanna know about it.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.458
I know. I will.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.339
What you doing today besides kissing me?

08:26.422 --> 08:30.635
I was gonna ask you if you could drive me
to the BMW dealership in Eureka.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.720
My car is making a weird noise.

08:32.803 --> 08:33.971
Did you call Bert?

08:34.055 --> 08:37.433
Yeah, he said he doesn't have the tools
to fix a German car, or something.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.520
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Can it wait till tomorrow?

08:40.603 --> 08:43.523
It's just that today at 4:00
was the only appointment they had.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.775
Otherwise I have to wait for, like,
two weeks.

08:45.858 --> 08:50.029
Okay, I mean, it's gonna be tight,
but I'll make it work.

08:50.112 --> 08:51.739
-Thank you.
-Okay.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.742
Maybe we could just stay like this
until then.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.118
-Yeah.
-Really?

08:57.161 --> 08:58.538
I have to go to work, though.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.207
Oh, no, work ruins everything.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.917
-Doesn't it?
-Yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.544
Mm.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.586
-All right.
-Okay.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.296
-Off you go.
-All right.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.215
-I'll see you in a few hours.
-All right.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.550
-Bye.
-Bye.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.104
Hey. I thought you had the day off.

09:23.187 --> 09:25.273
I'm picking up my check.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.984
-Hi.
-Hey.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.361
Denny, Ricky. Ricky, Denny.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.196
-I've seen you around.
-Yeah, same.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.408
Oh, your two slices of
my peanut butter banana bread

09:35.491 --> 09:37.493
and some flaxseed granola.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.996
-Thanks.
-Sounds like lunch for a squirrel.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.331
-Not a fan of flaxseed?
-No. Seeds are for birds.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.001
-So are you going somewhere?
-Stockman's Point.

09:45.084 --> 09:45.918
What's that?

09:46.002 --> 09:49.630
Oh, it's this suspension bridge
above a river with a super sick waterfall.

09:49.714 --> 09:50.965
Sounds awesome.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.676
You should take Lizzie.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.971
-Yeah, whenever you're free.
-No, why don't you go now?

09:57.054 --> 09:59.557
-I'll cover your shift.
-You don't have to do that.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.685
Actually, you'd be doing me a favor.
I could use the cash.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.813
-Are you up for company?
-Absolutely.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.154
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah, you too.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.658
Hey. I thought you were
going to the movies today.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.453
-I can go tomorrow.
-It's a nice thing you did for Lizzie.

10:31.547 --> 10:34.925
Who's the idiot who put the coffee
next to the cleaning supplies?

10:35.009 --> 10:37.511
Well, the only thing I'll say
is it wasn't me.

10:37.595 --> 10:41.223
And until you're steady on your feet,
you shouldn't be up on a step stool.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.060
For Pete's sake, how am I supposed
to reach the cupboard?

10:44.143 --> 10:45.394
Ask for help.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.063
And what were you looking for?

10:47.146 --> 10:48.773
The picnic basket.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.901
You said we were going
to the botanical gardens. Remember?

10:51.984 --> 10:54.904
I can't go now.
I have to reorganize the whole kitchen.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.530
-It's a mess.
-Hope, no, no.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.200
We both said we wanted to spend
this day together.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.955
Um... How long will it take to get there?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.000
Thirty minutes?

11:09.293 --> 11:11.253
I don't think I'm up to it.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.173
Leaving the house or being in a car?

11:14.256 --> 11:16.884
-Both.
-When you drive with Jo Ellen,

11:16.967 --> 11:17.968
does it bother you?

11:18.052 --> 11:20.096
She never stops talking.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.473
Honey, honey. Be honest with me.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.351
If being in a car triggers you,
we should talk to your doctor.

11:25.434 --> 11:28.479
Vernon, the last thing I need
is you psychoanalyzing me--

11:28.562 --> 11:29.563
I'm not analyzing.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.483
I'm just concerned about you.

11:32.566 --> 11:36.237
-You survived a horrible accident.
-And I want to move past it.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.240
Of course you do,
but your body isn't done healing--

11:39.323 --> 11:43.160
Well, my body needs to hurry up,
and you need to quit hovering.

11:43.869 --> 11:44.954
Okay.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.455
-Okay.
-Okay.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.084
Uh... I understand.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.210
Thank you.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.222
Look, I'll make you a deal.

12:03.305 --> 12:06.225
We'll go to the gardens if you agree

12:06.308 --> 12:09.770
not to bring up anything about my health
or the accident.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.022
Okay.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.190
Is that a yes?

12:14.316 --> 12:15.443
Affirmative.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.445
I'll get my sun hat.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.876
So you don't know
who's on Calvin's payroll?

12:31.959 --> 12:34.879
No. I've only ever just dealt with him.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.714
What about Jeb Barker?

12:36.797 --> 12:37.715
-Jeb?
-Yeah.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.509
Oh, Jeb's a good guy.

12:40.593 --> 12:45.014
Besides, even if he was,
he's smart enough to keep his mouth shut.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.140
Okay.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.727
-Hey...
-Hmm?

12:50.603 --> 12:55.149
I hate the idea of you being stuck
in the middle of this whole mess.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.653
I'm not gonna sit around with a law degree
and watch you go to prison

12:59.737 --> 13:01.697
for something you didn't do.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.282
And you're not gonna run away.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.915
-What?
-Nothing.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.041
No, tell me.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.002
I've never been with someone like you.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.131
What, like a control freak?

13:20.591 --> 13:21.425
No.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.222
Like a woman who doesn't back down...

13:27.473 --> 13:28.891
no matter the odds.

13:30.392 --> 13:33.395
It's... sexy.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.734
Yeah, well, you're pretty sexy yourself.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.112
Oh, yeah?

13:42.905 --> 13:43.739
Yeah.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.040
You make me so crazy.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.174
You know what drives me crazy?

14:02.675 --> 14:03.676
Mm-mm.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.402
Oh, I know.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.611
Come here, baby.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.447
Muriel wasn't kidding,
that new doctor's cute.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.199
Oh, my gosh.

14:27.283 --> 14:30.369
-Well, he's a very good doctor.
-That part never came up.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.871
Of course it didn't. Uh...

14:31.954 --> 14:35.541
Okay, so Miss Chloe
is in the 70th percentile

14:35.624 --> 14:36.876
for both height and weight.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.336
-That's excellent.
-I've been giving her that formula

14:39.420 --> 14:41.380
-you mentioned, and she loves it.
-Good.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.299
Let's keep her on that along with solids

14:43.382 --> 14:45.467
and I'll see her back here
in a couple months.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.802
-Okay.
-How's that sound?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.762
-How's that sound?
-Oh...

14:48.846 --> 14:51.056
Are you okay? Cameron.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.143
-Can you come take the baby?
-Yeah. I can take her.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.936
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.648
-Hey. You okay?
-Mm...

14:59.732 --> 15:01.609
Okay, let me check your pulse.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.070
I don't know what happened.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.329
-Hey, Jack.
-What's up?

15:14.038 --> 15:18.167
-Uh, that preschool in Eureka. Harkett?
-Mm-hm?

15:18.250 --> 15:19.627
They need a deposit.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.462
So the twins can stay on the waitlist.

15:21.545 --> 15:25.341
Yeah, well, I haven't had the time
to take the tour yet.

15:26.300 --> 15:30.095
Well, it's the best school in the area
and we can cover the cost.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.265
It's not about the cost. I'm not even sure
I want them to go there.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.475
Why not?

15:34.558 --> 15:37.519
-Because it looks pretentious.
-What makes you think that?

15:37.603 --> 15:41.732
For one, there's a picture of a toddler
playing golf on the cover of the brochure.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.567
You're being a little judgmental.

15:43.651 --> 15:47.821
They also have a science lab
and an amazing library.

15:47.905 --> 15:51.033
Look, I told Todd when he called
that I'd take a look, and I will.

15:51.116 --> 15:54.453
Jack, but by then we'll be so far
down the list the boys will never get in.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.458
Did you say boys?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.881
-We're having boys?
-Yeah, we are.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.426
-Wait, how long have you known that?
-I found out last week.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.720
What, and you didn't tell me?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.555
Todd wanted to keep it quiet.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.599
The only people that know are me and him.

16:15.683 --> 16:16.725
And, uh...

16:18.602 --> 16:20.354
-And Jo Ellen.
-Jo Ellen?

16:20.437 --> 16:23.107
I didn't tell her on purpose.
It just slipped out.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.316
If it wasn't on purpose,

16:24.400 --> 16:26.860
-then I guess that doesn't count.
-Jack, I'm sorry.

16:27.444 --> 16:31.365
We just thought it would be fun
if the gender reveal was a surprise.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.912
-What else aren't you telling me?
-Nothing.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.039
I don't know why you're getting so upset.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.499
If the situation was reversed,

16:40.582 --> 16:44.211
-you'd be totally cool?
-Todd is my husband, and we're a team.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.173
You might not like it, but you're the one
that didn't want to get married.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.425
This conversation's over.

16:50.217 --> 16:53.345
Jack, I apologized.
I don't know what else you want me to say.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.431
I don't want you to say anything,
Charmaine.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.975
I want you to start acting
like I'm the twins' father.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.408
Okay, your blood pressure is good.

17:14.491 --> 17:17.202
-Have you been taking your Lamotrigine?
-Yeah.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.872
And what about your sleep?

17:19.955 --> 17:20.873
It's not great,

17:20.956 --> 17:24.585
but I don't want to take anything in case
Chloe wakes up in the middle of the night.

17:25.085 --> 17:25.919
Right.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.215
Tara, how are you coping with everything?

17:31.467 --> 17:35.763
I'm fine during the day,
but at night it's awful.

17:37.639 --> 17:41.226
I can't stop thinking about her.
I just miss her so much.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.353
I know you do, honey. I'm so sorry.

17:43.437 --> 17:48.150
Sometimes lack of sleep, plus stress,
can override your medication.

17:51.028 --> 17:55.449
Hey. There's a bed upstairs.
I would love it if you could lay down.

17:55.532 --> 17:58.494
-I can't. I have Chloe.
-We can watch her.

17:58.577 --> 18:01.121
No, this is silly. I can sleep at home.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.874
I know, but I just--
I think you're too tired to drive.

18:03.957 --> 18:06.043
You sure you're okay to watch her?

18:06.126 --> 18:07.461
We're fine.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.756
In fact, I think
maybe we'll have a little snack.

18:10.839 --> 18:14.551
What do you think, Chloe?
You see, Chloe agrees with me.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.512
All right.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.305
Okay, I'll show you where it is.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.441
You know, it was right over there,

18:29.525 --> 18:33.237
in front of the magnolia trees,
where we first kissed.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.363
No.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.574
Our first kiss
was in the Elizabethan hedge maze.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.451
-Are you sure?
-I'm positive.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.703
You dropped your glasses along the way

18:41.787 --> 18:44.832
and we had to go all the way back
through the maze to find them,

18:44.915 --> 18:47.042
-and when we did--
-Yes. We kissed.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.130
Yeah, you're right.

18:52.548 --> 18:56.677
I can't remember what I did yesterday,
but 20 years ago, clear as day.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.472
Look, your short-term memory will improve.
Just give it some time.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.475
-No doctor talk, remember?
-Hey, hey, you brought it up.

19:05.435 --> 19:09.690
You know, our first kiss seems eons ago,
but it feels like just yesterday.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.608
Until I look in the mirror.

19:11.692 --> 19:16.989
Well, I still see the same beautiful woman
I fell in love with 20 years ago.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.740
-Well, now I'm concerned.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.534
Is your macular thing getting worse?

19:20.617 --> 19:21.743
Oh, no, no, no.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.913
My vision is doing very well, thank you.

19:26.248 --> 19:29.918
And the treatment appears to be working.

19:31.211 --> 19:34.548
-Are you buttering me up for something?
-No. No. No.

19:34.631 --> 19:37.176
But I do want to ask you something
about Denny.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.721
I think maybe he should just stay with us.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.347
Right now he's at the B&B.

19:42.431 --> 19:46.393
We've got the extra room, and he came
all this way just to visit with me.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.478
But I haven't met him yet.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.063
I can invite him over tonight.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.566
Tonight I'll be wiped out.

19:53.942 --> 19:57.070
Okay, sure. Uh... How about tomorrow?

19:57.154 --> 20:01.116
Vernon, I'm just not ready to have
a stranger in the house.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.745
Hope, he is not a stranger.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.956
-He's my grandson.
-You've known him for what? A week?

20:08.040 --> 20:13.295
Yes, but if he stayed with us,
we'd spend a whole lot more time together.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.839
The house isn't ready.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.342
I have to vacuum and change the sheets--

20:18.425 --> 20:20.427
Denny isn't going to care
about any of that.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.849
If there is another reason
that you don't want him staying with us,

20:25.933 --> 20:28.101
-then just be honest.
-I can't.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.687
-Why not?
-Because you'll want to fix it.

20:31.313 --> 20:35.108
All right, whatever it is,
I promise I won't get involved.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.151
I'm angry.

20:36.235 --> 20:40.530
I'm angry about losing Lilly,
and my accident,

20:40.614 --> 20:43.617
and not being able to remember
why I walked into a room.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.244
What do you need?

20:47.913 --> 20:49.206
I feel...

20:50.123 --> 20:51.208
lost.

20:53.043 --> 20:56.880
And the only way I can find myself
is to be alone.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.760
Does that include me?

21:02.552 --> 21:03.720
No.

21:06.056 --> 21:09.851
I'm asking you to keep everyone else
away from me.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.282
-Ah! Good girl.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.367
She really likes you.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.868
And I really love her.

21:26.952 --> 21:30.789
What's not to love?
Tiny fingers, a cute little nose...

21:32.374 --> 21:34.543
Have you spent
a lot of time around babies?

21:34.626 --> 21:38.880
Not really. I mean, I have a nephew,
but I wasn't around him that much.

21:38.964 --> 21:39.923
Why, because of work?

21:40.007 --> 21:43.260
No, it was more to do
with being a bachelor.

21:43.343 --> 21:44.594
Oh, really?

21:44.678 --> 21:47.139
I was going out every night,
dating different women,

21:47.222 --> 21:48.640
just doing whatever I wanted.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.685
-Well, that sounds like being single.
-Yeah.

21:51.768 --> 21:55.272
After a while, I started wanting
something more meaningful.

21:56.565 --> 22:00.068
When you're young, it's so easy
to get caught up in wanting your freedom,

22:00.152 --> 22:02.154
but there's a price to pay for that.

22:02.237 --> 22:03.196
I totally get it.

22:04.948 --> 22:06.283
So, what's meaningful to you?

22:06.366 --> 22:09.911
-Oh, a wife. Three, four kids.
-Oh, wow.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.080
-Big house in the country.
-Four.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.457
Like Virgin River, you know,

22:13.540 --> 22:16.001
this seems like a really great place
to raise a family.

22:16.084 --> 22:17.919
-Yeah.
-How about you?

22:18.003 --> 22:19.588
See yourself staying here?

22:22.549 --> 22:25.093
I think that this place
has a way of growing on you.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.429
Yeah, it's beautiful. That's for sure.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.223
For me, it's more the people.

22:31.558 --> 22:32.601
I know it sounds weird,

22:32.684 --> 22:35.729
but I feel like I've known some of them
a lot longer than I have.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.272
Isn't that what everybody wants?

22:37.356 --> 22:40.275
To feel like you belong someplace
and that you're needed?

22:41.777 --> 22:44.279
Look, Chloe's mocking me now
for being too cheesy.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.240
Oh, no, she would never do such a thing.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.953
Um... You know, I actually have to go
make a couple phone calls.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.706
-Are you cool?
-Go ahead. We'll be fine. Right?

22:54.790 --> 22:57.417
I see you in a little bit. Okay.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.130
Do you want some more?

23:07.260 --> 23:09.137
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.681
-I didn't know you were coming.
-Brady needs bandages.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.809
Pharmacy's out of stock.
Maybe you have some.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.686
-I'm sure we do. I'll just go check.
-Thanks.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.237
This should hold him over.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.448
-Awesome. Thank you so much.
-No problem.

23:28.532 --> 23:31.118
Hey, I heard about your new job.
How's it going?

23:31.201 --> 23:33.286
-Yeah. So far so good.
-Nice.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.746
I'm glad you decided to stay.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.873
I didn't feel like going back
to Sacramento,

23:36.957 --> 23:38.959
and Jack didn't like
the idea either, so...

23:39.626 --> 23:42.504
Did you end up telling him
about what happened with your ex?

23:42.587 --> 23:44.047
-No, no.
-No?

23:44.131 --> 23:47.759
All that stuff that happened with Don
is in the past.

23:47.843 --> 23:48.677
Right.

23:49.845 --> 23:53.723
-I mean, it wasn't just stuff, though.
-No, no. I know that. I'm aware.

23:54.224 --> 23:58.270
And I'm over it.
And I don't want Jack to know.

23:58.353 --> 24:01.815
Oh, no. I haven't said anything.
Um... And I won't.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.693
I thought maybe he was the reason
you didn't wanna go back.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.320
If I even think about it,
I can't function.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.157
Yeah.

24:12.701 --> 24:16.538
Um, did you happen to get in touch
with that therapist?

24:16.621 --> 24:17.622
No.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.499
I just wanna forget about it.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.835
Yeah. I get it.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.797
If you change your mind,
want somebody to talk to, I'm here.

24:25.881 --> 24:29.092
If you don't, it's okay, no pressure.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.678
-Also, we could just hang out.
-Thank you.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.013
-Yeah.
-Thank you. I...

24:33.096 --> 24:36.433
I should get going.
Thank you for the bandages.

24:36.516 --> 24:39.186
-Yeah. You're welcome. I'll see you later.
-Okay. See you.

24:43.857 --> 24:44.983
-Thanks.
-You bet.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.526
So I was in the area

24:46.610 --> 24:51.698
and I thought that I would come
and try some of your famous artichoke dip.

24:51.781 --> 24:55.202
I am glad that you came by.
Could I get you a drink?

24:55.285 --> 24:58.705
I would love a bourbon and Coke,
but it's a little early.

24:58.788 --> 25:02.959
Hey, if you're looking for judgment,
you have come to the wrong place.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.880
-So bourbon, huh?
-Mm-hm. My family's from Kentucky.

25:06.963 --> 25:10.175
-Oh, Bluegrass State.
-That's right.

25:10.258 --> 25:14.471
Well, if you're looking for a taste
from home without the kick...

25:14.554 --> 25:16.014
-Oh...
-How about this?

25:16.097 --> 25:17.390
-Sarsaparilla?
-Mm-hm.

25:17.474 --> 25:20.435
I haven't had that since I was a kid.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.563
-That looks good.
-Coming right up.

25:24.606 --> 25:25.815
Thank you.

25:29.903 --> 25:33.031
Mm. Oh, my gosh, this takes me back.

25:34.241 --> 25:37.702
Okay. Well, see if anything else
jumps out at you.

25:37.786 --> 25:38.995
-Thank you.
-You bet.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.961
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.880
-So how's the painting going?

25:48.964 --> 25:51.132
I had to strip a bunch of wood rot,
I'm beat.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.969
So why don't you quit for the day?
Hit it tomorrow.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.720
I can't. It's supposed to rain.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.973
Come on, man.
You've been at it since dawn.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.724
I'm gonna keep going until I finish.

25:59.808 --> 26:03.228
-Yeah, well, not a hill I'm gonna die on.
-I'm glad we're in agreement.

26:05.313 --> 26:06.481
What you making there?

26:06.565 --> 26:07.482
Artichoke dip.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.110
I don't recall seeing that on the menu.

26:10.193 --> 26:13.280
My aikido teacher, Julia,
she wanted to try some.

26:13.363 --> 26:14.698
Oh.

26:14.781 --> 26:17.409
Any chance Julia's the stunning woman
sitting at the bar?

26:17.492 --> 26:19.202
That would be her. Yeah.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.997
I think she might be interested
in a little more than your dip.

26:24.207 --> 26:26.710
No, man. I don't think so.

26:26.793 --> 26:29.379
Really. You gonna ask her out?

26:29.462 --> 26:30.839
Wasn't planning on it.

26:30.922 --> 26:33.174
-Why not?
-Because it's not the right time.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.802
Finding Christopher
is all I care about right now.

26:36.970 --> 26:37.804
Yeah, I get that.

26:37.887 --> 26:40.140
I've even hired
a second private detective.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.852
-You're doing everything you can, right?
-Yeah.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.229
Hang in there, bud.

26:54.362 --> 26:55.196
Hey.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.742
-How long was I out?
-Only a couple hours.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.119
I don't know what's wrong with me.

27:01.202 --> 27:03.747
I thought I'd be doing better by now,
but I'm not.

27:03.830 --> 27:07.459
Oh, my gosh,
grieving is different for everyone.

27:08.418 --> 27:11.880
It's a process, you know,
you can't rush it.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.590
You just have to work through it.

27:14.883 --> 27:15.717
Yeah.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.470
In the meantime, if you're okay with it,

27:18.553 --> 27:21.640
Connie has offered to spend the night
so that you can get some sleep.

27:21.723 --> 27:24.059
And the sewing circle ladies
will be on standby.

27:24.142 --> 27:27.270
-We're gonna reinstate the meal train.
-I feel like such a burden.

27:27.354 --> 27:30.273
Oh, my gosh, sweetheart.
You are not at all, okay?

27:30.357 --> 27:31.399
They wanna help you.

27:31.941 --> 27:33.318
I can't thank you enough.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.570
Oh, please, you've thanked me already.

27:36.112 --> 27:38.490
Hey, Tara. How you doing?

27:39.574 --> 27:40.533
A little better.

27:40.617 --> 27:43.203
Chloe's in the kitchen with Cameron,
if you wanna see her.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.954
-Okay, thanks.
-Yeah.

27:47.791 --> 27:48.792
She all right?

27:48.875 --> 27:51.419
Yeah, she's just not getting enough sleep.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.963
So I'm thinking of giving her
some D3 drops.

27:54.047 --> 27:56.007
And Connie's gonna spend
the night tonight.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.510
-Yeah, sounds like a good plan.
-Yeah.

27:59.803 --> 28:03.515
So how was the picnic?

28:04.307 --> 28:08.728
Oh, it was good until it wasn't.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.855
Oh. What happened?

28:13.316 --> 28:16.277
Hope's concussive symptoms
don't seem to be improving.

28:16.861 --> 28:20.782
Just remember, it's not uncommon,
especially in the first few months.

28:21.366 --> 28:24.786
Yes, but I'm just worried
the longer it goes on,

28:24.869 --> 28:27.038
the more likely it'll be permanent.

28:27.122 --> 28:30.041
Is it something specific,
or is it a combination of symptoms?

28:30.542 --> 28:31.960
It's a combination.

28:32.043 --> 28:36.506
Loss of impulse control,
increased reactivity, mood swings.

28:36.589 --> 28:40.552
Then you add fatigue and memory loss.
It adds fuel to the fire.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.929
-So it's cyclical.
-Exactly.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.266
I feel like I'm living with a stranger.

28:47.642 --> 28:50.228
Doc, please don't be so hard on yourself.

28:50.311 --> 28:53.523
TBIs put a huge strain on a relationship.

28:53.606 --> 28:55.859
But the thing is, before the accident,

28:55.942 --> 28:58.361
I pretty much knew
what Hope was thinking and feeling,

28:58.445 --> 29:01.364
and now I have no idea
what is going on inside her head.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.991
I don't think she does either.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.367
But that's the problem.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.995
She's struggling,
but she doesn't want me to help and...

29:08.413 --> 29:11.750
It's just so frustrating.
I don't know what to do.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.210
Well, hopefully this is just temporary.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.756
And what if this is the new normal?

29:34.981 --> 29:36.941
Watch your step, it's kind of tricky here.

29:39.903 --> 29:43.239
-Shoot, are you okay?
-Didn't tell me it was straight uphill.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.201
-Here.
-Thanks.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.040
So hiking's not your thing, huh?

29:52.123 --> 29:53.833
-How'd you know?
-Your shoes.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.586
-They used to be white.
-Now they're brown.

29:56.669 --> 29:58.254
And soon they'll be trash.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.137
-What?
-Nothing.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.681
-Do I have dirt on my face?
-No.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.558
If you're lying, I'll find out.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.686
I'm joking.

30:15.146 --> 30:18.358
I do hate it when people let you
walk around with spinach in your teeth

30:18.441 --> 30:21.152
or toilet paper stuck to your shoe
and never say anything.

30:21.903 --> 30:24.823
I think people do that because
they don't wanna embarrass anyone.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.367
It's more embarrassing not to know.

30:27.450 --> 30:29.494
But hypothetically,

30:29.577 --> 30:31.746
if they don't bring attention
to whatever it is,

30:31.830 --> 30:35.667
then maybe no one will notice,
or it'll fix itself.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.794
That's a lot of ifs.

30:39.420 --> 30:42.632
It takes a lot of guts to tell someone
something they don't wanna hear.

30:43.424 --> 30:44.717
Actually, um...

30:45.385 --> 30:48.805
me and Ricky, we used to date,
and that's why we broke up.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.891
I figured there was something up
with you guys.

30:51.975 --> 30:54.811
-Why?
-The way he looks out for you.

30:56.771 --> 30:58.439
We were pretty serious.

30:59.232 --> 31:01.860
I ended things because
he joined the Marines without telling me

31:01.943 --> 31:04.195
-'cause he thought I'd get upset.
-Would you have?

31:04.279 --> 31:05.280
Maybe.

31:06.030 --> 31:08.408
But I would've
eventually supported his decision.

31:08.491 --> 31:10.285
He was scared to disappoint you.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.245
But I ended up not trusting him.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.665
-I think that's worse.
-I guess so.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.752
Anyway, we should pick up the pace.

31:19.836 --> 31:21.671
We don't wanna hike back in the dark.

31:29.804 --> 31:30.680
Hey.

31:31.514 --> 31:33.016
-Hey.
-That looks great.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.811
Thanks. I just finished here,
and now I'm gonna hit the back.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.397
It's almost 2:00. We need to leave soon.

31:39.480 --> 31:43.359
I'm sorry, this turned out
to be a bigger job than I thought,

31:43.443 --> 31:44.986
and I had to deal with Charmaine.

31:45.069 --> 31:48.698
-What happened?
-Turns out we're having twin boys.

31:48.781 --> 31:49.782
Aww.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.243
Why, what's wrong?

31:53.161 --> 31:55.330
She knew for a week, didn't tell me.

31:56.122 --> 31:57.582
Oh, wow.

31:58.207 --> 31:59.334
Yeah.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.712
I know I couldn't trust Todd but I thought
Charmaine would be straight with me.

32:02.795 --> 32:06.299
-Is there anything I can do?
-No. Thanks.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.384
It is what it is, right?

32:09.886 --> 32:12.764
I'm sorry. I know you wanted
to get your car looked at today.

32:12.847 --> 32:14.223
It's fine. I'll figure it out.

32:14.807 --> 32:16.726
-Sure?
-Yeah, it's fine.

32:19.979 --> 32:22.857
-So?
-Everything was delicious.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.860
Ah. No, you don't.
This one is on the house.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.363
-I can't accept that.
-Hey, I insist.

32:28.446 --> 32:31.824
-You're not gonna win this game.
-Okay.

32:31.908 --> 32:35.495
Okay, well, what about I take you up
on that private aikido lesson?

32:35.578 --> 32:38.623
A trade? Yeah, that could work.

32:38.706 --> 32:44.003
And I know that you are busy, so,
you know, whenever you have an open spot.

32:44.087 --> 32:46.130
I will make the time. Trust me.

32:54.055 --> 32:54.889
Hey, Preach.

32:54.973 --> 32:58.393
I thought you and Jack were supposed
to be headed over to the boat launch.

32:58.476 --> 33:01.896
Yeah, well, he is still painting
and he doesn't wanna stop.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.524
His dad made a crack about the paint...

33:04.607 --> 33:06.359
Oh, yeah, that's right.

33:07.610 --> 33:10.405
Anyway, can you text Reuben
and let him know we can't come?

33:10.488 --> 33:12.907
-Yeah, you bet.
-Hey, Preach.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.743
Where do you want me to put this ahi?
Freezer or fridge?

33:16.703 --> 33:18.579
-Refrigerator. Thanks.
-Cool.

33:20.081 --> 33:23.751
Actually, I may have a way
to get you guys over to the island.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.774
Oh, my God. It's so beautiful.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.071
Hey, thanks for taking me up here.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.657
I'm glad Ricky offered
to cover your shift.

33:56.325 --> 33:59.078
Actually, we're supposed to do a scene
from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>

33:59.162 --> 34:02.582
for the Renaissance Faire,
and now we're not.

34:02.665 --> 34:04.417
-Too awkward?
-Right.

34:05.251 --> 34:07.211
So I don't have a partner.

34:07.795 --> 34:08.629
That sucks.

34:09.213 --> 34:12.842
This might sound crazy,
but would you be up for it?

34:13.426 --> 34:14.719
Perform it with you?

34:15.511 --> 34:16.888
I think we'd have fun.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.018
It's not really my thing.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.272
Sorry.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.004
Hey, Jack.

34:50.755 --> 34:51.714
Hey, fellas.

34:51.798 --> 34:53.758
I brought in some reinforcements.

34:54.675 --> 34:56.719
-For what?
-Well, to help you finish the job.

34:56.803 --> 34:59.555
I've got Ricky covering the bar,
or he'd be out here too.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.307
Come on. You don't have to do that.

35:01.390 --> 35:03.267
-Oh, Preacher said we did.
-Oh, he did?

35:03.351 --> 35:06.104
Oh, come on, now. That is not true.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.523
-You promised us a free beer, right?
-Okay.

35:09.023 --> 35:11.484
Jack, ignore these old fools.
We're happy to help.

35:11.567 --> 35:12.777
What about your hand?

35:12.860 --> 35:14.695
As long as you don't ask me to vacuum,

35:14.779 --> 35:16.614
-we're good to go.
-Thank you.

35:16.697 --> 35:19.367
I appreciate it.
Why don't you guys get started over there?

35:19.450 --> 35:20.284
Okay.

35:23.704 --> 35:24.539
Thanks, man.

35:24.622 --> 35:27.083
I told you, I've got your back.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.044
And after this,
I'll take you out for some wings.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.171
All right, only if I can buy the beer.

35:41.055 --> 35:42.014
Hello.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.850
Well, hello there.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.562
I made you and Hope
a strawberry cheesecake.

35:47.645 --> 35:50.022
Oh, that was very kind of you.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.608
You know, I thought you two
could use a little treat.

35:52.692 --> 35:53.609
Oh, yeah.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.612
-Where is Hope? Is she around?
-Uh...

35:56.696 --> 36:00.366
She's inside, she's just not up
for company just yet.

36:00.449 --> 36:01.284
Yeah.

36:01.909 --> 36:05.204
Well, you know, if you're game...

36:05.746 --> 36:08.624
Oh, absolutely.

36:08.708 --> 36:11.586
-And do you want some wine? Okay.
-I would love some, thank you.

36:12.378 --> 36:14.922
-That needs to go in the fridge. Okay.
-Okay.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.098
Okay.

36:27.393 --> 36:28.394
-Hey.
-Hi.

36:28.477 --> 36:31.522
-How was your nap?
-Good. I thought I heard voices.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.567
Oh, yeah. Muriel is right outside.

36:35.526 --> 36:39.071
She made us a strawberry cheesecake.

36:39.822 --> 36:42.366
-Well, that was thoughtful of her.
-Yeah.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.077
And we're gonna play
a round of backgammon.

36:45.703 --> 36:46.746
Why don't you join us?

36:48.039 --> 36:50.249
-No. You go ahead.
-Okay.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.711
Okay. Um...

36:54.503 --> 36:56.631
We'll be right outside
if you change your mind.

37:04.805 --> 37:06.933
-We're good to go.
-Uh-oh.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.810
You're just trying
to take some of my money.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.146
Let's just see what happens.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.606
-Beat that.
-Ha-ha!

37:16.609 --> 37:18.569
Okay. Oh, gee, that's too bad.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.446
-Six, I'll just go right...
-Yeah, yeah.

37:20.529 --> 37:21.364
Yeah.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.681
-Okay, what's going on?
-Ask Mel.

37:54.981 --> 37:55.815
Hey, babe.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.067
Hey.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.781
I have something to show you.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.158
Well, does it involve wings?

38:07.285 --> 38:09.829
Actually, it does.

38:10.579 --> 38:13.916
-How much further are we gonna go?
-Oh, just a few more steps. Okay.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.042
-What is that?
-Nothing.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.836
-It's just a tree.
-Oh, just a tree.

38:16.919 --> 38:19.338
-Okay.
-Step up. Step up. Okay. Now, stop.

38:20.047 --> 38:22.717
Okay. Now you can open your eyes.

38:24.802 --> 38:25.803
What the...?

38:27.263 --> 38:28.389
Was this your idea?

38:30.016 --> 38:32.059
Well, I did have a little help
from Preacher.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.271
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.152
-Oh, hey, Brad.
-Oh, hey.

38:41.235 --> 38:43.070
So you're in on this too, huh?

38:43.738 --> 38:44.655
I'm just the ride.

38:45.489 --> 38:48.200
-You're sneaky.
-Yep. That's right.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.411
-You ready to go? Okey-dokey.
-Yeah, after you.

38:50.953 --> 38:53.789
-Ma'am. You're most welcome.
-Oh, thank you, sir.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.834
-We're gonna talk.
-Yeah, yeah.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.760
-Good?
-Yeah.

39:05.843 --> 39:09.347
So are you at least gonna tell me
where we're headed?

39:09.847 --> 39:12.433
-Nope.
-Brad, where we headed?

39:12.516 --> 39:14.643
-Up.
-Why you gotta take her side?

39:15.394 --> 39:16.354
'Cause she's paying.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.566
Hey, thanks for meeting me.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.903
Glad you called. Um...

40:05.986 --> 40:09.031
-You want something to drink?
-No, thanks. Um...

40:09.949 --> 40:14.954
Actually, I wanted to talk to you about
Calvin's connection to Emerald Lumber.

40:16.622 --> 40:20.042
-Oh, I didn't know this was work-related.
-Yeah.

40:20.126 --> 40:24.338
I think Brady being the suspect
is just a little too convenient.

40:24.922 --> 40:25.756
Okay.

40:26.465 --> 40:28.759
One minute you have zero suspects,

40:28.843 --> 40:30.761
then Brady's alibi completely falls apart,

40:30.845 --> 40:33.139
and then the warrant
just falls into your lap?

40:33.222 --> 40:34.557
What are you saying?

40:34.640 --> 40:38.185
I know the joint task force's mandate

40:38.269 --> 40:41.188
was to arrest Calvin
and flip him in order to find his boss.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.150
But no one knows who that is.

40:45.317 --> 40:48.362
And the only way to really take down
the fentanyl pipeline...

40:49.488 --> 40:51.490
is to take down the head
of the organization.

40:51.574 --> 40:53.909
What does any of that
have to do with Brady?

40:53.993 --> 40:56.162
The two are connected somehow.

40:56.245 --> 40:58.497
I just have to figure out how.

41:00.332 --> 41:01.959
Why are you telling me all this?

41:02.042 --> 41:05.504
I'm the one who asked Jack to talk to you
about helping with the case.

41:05.588 --> 41:09.467
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
that I told him, Brie. I can't help.

41:09.550 --> 41:10.718
Mike, why not?

41:10.801 --> 41:15.514
Local and federal law enforcement
put thousands of hours into this case.

41:15.598 --> 41:16.515
Yeah. So?

41:16.599 --> 41:20.686
So it's their case to crack, not yours.

41:31.947 --> 41:33.532
And here comes the rain.

41:33.616 --> 41:36.202
Don't worry. Be clear by the morning.

41:38.078 --> 41:39.330
What do you think?

41:39.413 --> 41:41.457
No one's ever done anything
like this for me.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.084
You deserve to be spoiled once in a while.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.252
Oh, thank you.

41:46.253 --> 41:49.089
Hey, lovebirds.
It's your captain speaking.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.883
We're about halfway there.

41:50.966 --> 41:53.135
Jack, you wanna get up here
and take the stick?

41:53.219 --> 41:54.553
-Yeah.
-What?

41:55.054 --> 41:56.764
No. No, he's kid-- You're kidding.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.474
Not kidding. Brad's given me lessons.

41:58.557 --> 42:02.603
I think it would be safer for Brad to be
up there and for us to stay back here.

42:02.686 --> 42:06.148
Oh, so half a dozen flight hours
doesn't inspire your confidence?

42:06.232 --> 42:09.443
-Not at 10,000 feet, no.
-O ye of little faith.

42:10.611 --> 42:12.112
You're on your own, Brad.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.991
Hey, Brad, is your arm okay?

42:16.075 --> 42:17.993
It's been bugging me all day.

42:18.786 --> 42:21.997
-Must've strained something at the gym.
-It's called getting old, bud,

42:22.581 --> 42:23.916
Yeah, right.

42:26.335 --> 42:27.211
Brad.

42:27.962 --> 42:30.256
-Okay, Brad. Is your chest tight?
-Yeah.

42:30.339 --> 42:32.174
-Like somebody's sitting on it?
-Yeah.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.134
I think he's having a heart attack.
