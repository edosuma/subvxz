00:43.669 --> 00:44.586
Hap!

00:51.218 --> 00:52.469
Do not stand.

00:53.095 --> 00:56.139
Just turn around in the chair
and face me.

00:58.642 --> 01:01.854
Put both hands, palms up, on your knees.

01:02.771 --> 01:06.399
This... this is exactly
what it looks like, Stan.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.777
I have five people locked in my basement--

01:08.861 --> 01:10.445
You can get it off your chest
in the deposition.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.616
-I have to talk to you about Evelyn--
-You don't say my wife's name.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.621
What if I told you
that I could cure ALS?

01:18.704 --> 01:21.289
I could free her
from the prison of her body.

01:22.708 --> 01:26.003
Stand up. Turn around.
I'm gonna cuff you.

01:27.545 --> 01:30.382
I've spent my life studying
near-death experiences.

01:31.049 --> 01:35.262
These five NDE survivors in my basement,
they have an ability, a technology,

01:35.345 --> 01:36.972
it's beyond my comprehension.

01:37.055 --> 01:41.434
It's beyond science as it stands today,
but they can heal your wife. I swear it.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.814
You've got a silver tongue
and you'd say anything.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.274
I don't want to hear it.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.192
One of my subjects died.

01:50.694 --> 01:53.238
They brought him back to life
11 hours later.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.949
Lazarus from the dead.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.034
Enough.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.535
Let them do it for Evelyn.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.621
If they can, you walk away.
You don't look back.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.540
You don't ask any questions.
You let me continue my work.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.376
And if they can't, you lock me up.
What do you have to lose?

02:06.459 --> 02:07.795
I don't make deals--

02:07.878 --> 02:09.129
You know as well as I do,
there's no such thing

02:09.212 --> 02:10.505
as good and evil, black and white.

02:10.588 --> 02:14.342
There's only gray.
There's only what a man can stand.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.963
Okay.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.047
Okay.

03:19.491 --> 03:20.826
Oh, my God!

03:20.909 --> 03:22.870
Oh, my God!

03:29.752 --> 03:31.419
Which ones do you need?

03:36.967 --> 03:39.803
Oh, thank God.

03:39.886 --> 03:40.929
This one.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.308
And this one.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.269
Oh, sweet God!

03:47.352 --> 03:49.187
This man's wife is sick.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.399
And you two are gonna heal her.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.781
Come on.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.959
- Up the stairs. Move.
- You don't understand.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.461
- Slow. Hap, slow!
- We're prisoners!

04:12.544 --> 04:14.588
- Let us out!
- You don't understand!

04:14.671 --> 04:17.215
- Let us out of here!
- Help us!

04:17.299 --> 04:19.134
- Help us!
- Get us out of here!

04:19.217 --> 04:21.636
Help us, please!

04:21.719 --> 04:23.721
Don't leave us!

04:40.738 --> 04:41.990
This is Evelyn.

04:44.742 --> 04:48.205
I'm gonna lock the door
and we'll be watching at the monitor

04:48.288 --> 04:50.248
until her condition improves.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.923
Let's go. Now!

05:20.904 --> 05:22.823
You understand what's happening, right?

05:23.740 --> 05:26.827
If we don't heal the sheriff's wife,
Hap goes to prison.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.539
So we just don't move?

05:30.622 --> 05:32.624
We move,
but we just don't do it quite right.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.023
We can't not.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.441
Don't you see?

05:58.525 --> 06:01.528
The sheriff's all hyped up,
but when this doesn't work, he'll crash.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.114
Hap will look mad and he'll turn him in.

06:08.076 --> 06:11.038
If we don't try to help her,
then we aren't who we say we are.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.386
What are they doing?

06:26.469 --> 06:29.389
-Wha... What's going on?
-It's okay. Just... just wait.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.211
What's... what's happening?

06:59.294 --> 07:03.048
Trust me, Stan. Just trust me.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.532
-What's going on?
-It's working.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.662
It's... It's working.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.271
-What...?
-No, no. It's all right.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.565
I got a thermal image camera.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.502
You're here.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.798
You're finally here.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.425
She grabbed my hand.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.927
She moved.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.306
She pulled me down and said,

08:35.390 --> 08:39.811
"I need to tell you a story
about when I was a little girl.

08:41.104 --> 08:44.607
I was out swimming in the waves
and I got lost.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.527
They were too big
and I felt myself go under

08:47.610 --> 08:52.323
and it got so dark and black and cold,
and then suddenly,

08:52.407 --> 08:54.409
I was outside of my body.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.829
And there was a small white light,

08:57.912 --> 08:59.789
and I moved towards it.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.541
And at the center of that light...

09:02.542 --> 09:03.877
was a little girl.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.878
And that little girl said..."

09:05.962 --> 09:07.839
"One day...

09:07.922 --> 09:14.637
you will help two captive angels.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.100
It will be very hard.

09:19.016 --> 09:23.063
It will be very... painful.

09:23.146 --> 09:27.734
But you must stay alive
to give this to them."

09:30.445 --> 09:35.867
And a white moth flew
from her mouth into mine.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.578
I swallowed it.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.666
I have held it inside me,

09:43.750 --> 09:47.170
waiting for you to come.

09:48.380 --> 09:51.007
Would you like to know what it is?

09:52.008 --> 09:54.511
Come closer.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.014
It's almost over...

09:59.224 --> 10:03.603
but I get to hold my Stan one more time.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.192
Will you guard it with your lives?

10:09.817 --> 10:11.319
We will.

10:11.403 --> 10:12.987
The fifth movement...

10:14.822 --> 10:19.536
How do we use it?
How do we, um... escape?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.538
It's a matter of will.

10:22.164 --> 10:25.417
It's... it's always a matter of will.

10:25.500 --> 10:31.339
Only a person of great determination
can swim to another side.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.842
Are you ready?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.389
I need to do this.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.308
She's moving!

10:41.391 --> 10:42.975
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.347
Oh!

11:21.473 --> 11:24.476
Oh. I'm here.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.023
Get away.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.281
Don't touch him!
Get away from him!

11:38.865 --> 11:39.824
Get out!

11:40.450 --> 11:42.702
I will shoot Homer. Get out!

11:45.330 --> 11:47.457
Homer!

11:49.250 --> 11:50.335
<i>Homer!</i>

11:50.418 --> 11:53.004
We had everything
we needed to escape.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.381
Finally, after all these years...

11:57.467 --> 11:59.177
We had kept each other alive.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.596
We had shared a bed.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.599
And in all that time...

12:06.351 --> 12:10.938
we'd never, not once... touched.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.357
- Homer!
- OA!

12:12.440 --> 12:13.733
Homer!

12:13.816 --> 12:15.902
OA!

12:15.985 --> 12:17.362
OA!

12:19.531 --> 12:20.615
Homer.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.374
Get out.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.586
Get out!

13:16.295 --> 13:17.505
Come on!

13:19.966 --> 13:22.385
<i>I'm lying there on the grass.</i>
<i>I can't move.</i>

13:23.678 --> 13:28.891
And then I feel the cold metal of a blade
pressed against my throat.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.604
<i>Did you think you were indispensable</i>
<i>to the work? To me?</i>

13:32.687 --> 13:34.439
Well, you're not.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.358
I have the fifth movement.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.402
I have Homer.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.739
-I don't...
-"I don't need you.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.742
I'm leaving you exactly as I found you.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.244
I don't have to kill you."

13:48.328 --> 13:51.205
<i>And even if you get back,</i>
<i>we'll be gone.</i>

13:51.288 --> 13:55.710
In another dimension,
all of us...

13:57.462 --> 13:59.464
and you'll be all alone.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.549
<i>"With nothing, with no one."</i>

14:05.762 --> 14:10.433
Sky is so big, trees...

14:12.101 --> 14:15.062
and a road... going somewhere.

14:15.647 --> 14:18.858
And I think of Homer and I grab onto him.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.651
<i>- And he kicks me away.</i>

14:20.735 --> 14:24.906
And he's in the car
and he's so... fast.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.949
I run to get him...

14:27.033 --> 14:28.493
I can't catch him.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.702
I...

14:29.786 --> 14:33.122
...really run so hard,
but I can't catch him,

14:33.205 --> 14:36.208
<i>and I scream, "Come back!"</i>

14:36.292 --> 14:37.627
Come back!

14:39.546 --> 14:41.213
"Come back."

14:42.882 --> 14:44.926
"Come back."

14:50.890 --> 14:52.058
Oh, my God.

17:11.489 --> 17:14.700
Abel, we said
all we had to say to each other!

17:14.784 --> 17:16.953
You and Nancy
are gonna have to leave!

17:42.144 --> 17:44.480
Wait, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.239
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.366
No, no. They're just, uh...

17:56.408 --> 17:58.077
They don't understand what we're doing.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.205
You... you were at the Olive Garden.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.666
Yeah, I... I'm Alfonso.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.126
I'm your daughter's friend.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.294
And don't worry,
I'm gonna prove that it's true.

18:07.378 --> 18:08.379
That what's true?

18:09.672 --> 18:11.298
Her whole story.

18:11.382 --> 18:13.259
Everything she went through.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.013
She told you?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.142
Yeah.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.518
It's, uh...

18:23.603 --> 18:25.772
I'm gonna make it all okay.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.439
Just, uh...

18:27.523 --> 18:28.524
It's okay.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.408
Anything you'd like to say?

19:22.036 --> 19:23.871
What were you doing
with those boys?

19:23.955 --> 19:25.748
Prairie,
what does it feel like to be home?

19:33.673 --> 19:36.759
Prairie, are you ready
to tell us how you got your sight?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.477
Oh, yeah. This'll work.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.527
I'll take it from here.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.489
Thank you.

20:19.969 --> 20:23.097
Oh, did you remember to give them your
Triple A card at the front desk?

20:23.180 --> 20:24.265
We get a discount.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.432
I know.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.686
- Maybe five, ten percent.
- I know, Nance.

20:35.276 --> 20:36.652
Needs a blanket.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.575
I'm okay.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.161
I'm okay.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.152
The house was by a mine.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.034
The cages were in a basement,

21:25.117 --> 21:29.746
in a room that...
wasn't that much bigger than this.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.836
My bed was against the wall.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.590
Sometimes, I slept on top of it.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.468
Sometimes, I slept underneath it.

21:45.679 --> 21:49.266
There was another cage here and one there.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.146
A young man was next to me.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.235
We fell in love.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.446
I love him.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.326
We drank water from a trough.

22:07.409 --> 22:10.287
We ate food made for animals.

22:10.371 --> 22:13.958
I went seven years
without touching someone else's skin.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.047
Do you want me to stop?

22:52.163 --> 22:53.539
Abel.

22:53.622 --> 22:57.334
Is everything all right?

22:57.418 --> 22:59.670
You asked if she left a note.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.831
Abel.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.460
Please, come back to the room.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.881
Come back to the room.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.967
I'm busy, Nance.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.969
I'm making a waffle.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.805
Then... I'm going to eat it.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.890
We can't talk here.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.142
That's right.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.651
You lied to me... for years...

24:05.652 --> 24:06.653
Every day...

24:08.280 --> 24:12.243
for over seven years, to be specific.

24:13.244 --> 24:16.205
I'm going to need a little time
to think about that.

24:24.338 --> 24:27.508
I know. I made a mistake.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.301
You lied to me.

24:30.761 --> 24:32.429
You lied to the police.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.931
I'll call... I'll call them
and explain the whole thing.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.977
But... but that doesn't change--

24:38.060 --> 24:40.979
It doesn't change the fact
that he took her away.

24:41.897 --> 24:46.360
What she told us last night,
it doesn't change any of that.

24:50.072 --> 24:51.323
Say something.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.619
I forgot coffee.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.383
When... when I found her note...

25:10.301 --> 25:13.345
and I saw... I saw what she wrote...

25:14.346 --> 25:16.348
-"I'm going to find my father."
-Uh-huh.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.600
Well, you're her father, Abel.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.144
-I was trying--
-You lied about the note

25:20.227 --> 25:23.439
because you were worried I would be hurt
by her choice of words?

25:24.565 --> 25:25.941
She disappeared.

25:27.568 --> 25:30.487
And you thought that's what I would have
on my mind?

26:01.852 --> 26:03.353
If she left a note,

26:03.437 --> 26:06.857
the police wouldn't even have
looked for her. I just thought--

26:06.940 --> 26:08.567
We should have made that decision...

26:09.318 --> 26:10.319
together.

26:16.783 --> 26:21.913
It all...
It all happened because I chose her.

26:24.833 --> 26:29.296
You wanted to adopt that little boy,
but... I wanted her.

26:35.302 --> 26:39.723
I thought because she was blind,
she would need me forever.

26:43.059 --> 26:48.232
I needed her... to love me.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.817
I just did.

26:51.818 --> 26:53.237
I needed too much.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.325
So, she left.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.956
How could I tell you?

27:08.043 --> 27:09.878
I couldn't tell you.

27:19.095 --> 27:21.390
Hi, uh, could you help me
find a phone number?

27:21.473 --> 27:22.474
<i>I'd be happy to.</i>

27:22.558 --> 27:25.727
Yeah, for, um...
Betty Broderick-Allen.

27:25.811 --> 27:26.853
<i>Is it Elizabeth?</i>

27:26.937 --> 27:28.104
Elizabeth...

27:28.188 --> 27:30.190
<i>I'm sorry, that number is unlisted.</i>

27:31.192 --> 27:33.235
Oh, um...

27:33.319 --> 27:35.696
Could you try Winchell?

27:35.779 --> 27:40.492
-W-I-N-C-H-E-L-L?
<i>-Certainly.</i>

27:40.576 --> 27:44.162
Oh, actually, sorry,
that's... that'd be a landline...

27:44.246 --> 27:45.247
Um...

27:46.332 --> 27:47.333
Oh... Uh...

27:49.334 --> 27:51.712
Try French. Alfonso...

27:56.800 --> 27:58.427
Alfonso, uh...

27:59.761 --> 28:00.929
<i>Ma'am?</i>

28:03.098 --> 28:07.353
Sorry, I, uh,
I don't know, but thank you.

28:11.982 --> 28:14.901
No. E-V-E-L-Y-N.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.781
You're the ALS Society.
The idea is you tell me.

28:20.991 --> 28:24.620
Well, what's the point of having a society
if you can't help each other?

28:26.162 --> 28:27.748
Forget it, dude.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.376
Yo, there's a Scott Browning

28:30.459 --> 28:32.419
who went missing in 2005.

28:32.503 --> 28:34.713
Heir to a big fortune in Canada.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.214
Yeah, but the dates don't match.

28:36.298 --> 28:39.301
Besides, Scott was a street kid
in Pennsylvania.

28:40.886 --> 28:44.265
Well, maybe we should try, like,
weird combinations instead of names.

28:44.890 --> 28:49.102
Uh, I'm gonna try "anesthesiologist"
and "pilot."

28:55.692 --> 28:57.236
We got this.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.223
Yes!

29:33.188 --> 29:35.065
It's a start...

29:35.148 --> 29:36.275
but we need more.

32:13.223 --> 32:14.766
Homer.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.732
Oh, my God.

32:58.602 --> 33:00.646
Whoa, whoa!

33:00.729 --> 33:01.855
-Easy, easy.
-I'm sorry.

33:03.524 --> 33:05.233
How'd you get in here?

33:05.317 --> 33:06.568
No, I didn't break in, I promise--

33:06.652 --> 33:08.904
So, how did you get in here?
Is somebody else here?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.697
-I'm sorry. No.
-Is somebody else here?

33:10.781 --> 33:12.198
-No.
-What's your name?

33:12.282 --> 33:14.993
- Alfonso.
- What?

33:15.076 --> 33:16.369
Alfonso Sosa.

33:17.621 --> 33:20.081
You're one of the boys that she spoke to.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.583
Huh?

33:21.667 --> 33:22.918
You know her?

33:24.252 --> 33:27.005
Yeah, I know her.

33:29.299 --> 33:31.342
She tell you about the brave Homer?

33:33.554 --> 33:35.013
And... and the mine?

33:35.931 --> 33:37.891
And Hap's near-death studies?

33:37.974 --> 33:40.101
No. She told me about you.

33:41.895 --> 33:43.063
You did good.

33:44.230 --> 33:47.192
She needed somebody to listen to her.
You did that for her.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.612
But they're lies.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.283
You know what
second-hand trauma is?

33:56.868 --> 33:59.454
When you take somebody else's pain,
so they can survive.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.747
That's what you did.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.084
That's what you did.

34:05.335 --> 34:06.795
But it's not true.

34:08.296 --> 34:11.633
Hey... come on.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.052
You did good.

34:20.976 --> 34:22.435
She told us a story.

34:23.687 --> 34:27.816
It just, uh... wasn't true.

34:38.619 --> 34:39.786
I'm keeping this one.

34:47.794 --> 34:49.796
Yeah, well, I gotta start my shift.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.559
Mom says
you got both classes you want,

35:44.643 --> 35:46.519
including the creative writing one?

35:47.437 --> 35:50.816
They're just online, so...
they take anybody who applies.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.402
I'm glad you're studying.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.446
Me, too.

35:57.698 --> 36:01.451
I took that Lyprexa on an empty stomach.
I feel a little dizzy.

36:02.368 --> 36:03.870
Are you okay to finish?

36:03.953 --> 36:06.498
It's fine. You have a lie down.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.327
- And there you have it.
- Oh, great.

36:46.913 --> 36:47.998
That's a cool box.

36:48.081 --> 36:50.709
Oh, I bought it at the Container Store.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.085
I really like that store.

36:54.254 --> 36:56.089
Heard you're planning to move out west?

36:56.172 --> 36:59.467
Oh, I don't know. Maybe.
Um, brought my car in for a tune-up.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.428
I have a cousin
who lives in Northern California.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.055
I thought I'd go sit by the Pacific.

37:05.681 --> 37:07.600
I've never been to California.

37:07.683 --> 37:09.435
No? Hmm.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.604
The kids wanna go to Disneyland.

37:11.688 --> 37:14.357
But, uh, the wife's afraid of earthquakes.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.526
You know, the big one.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.448
It was great working for you,
Principal Gilchrist.

37:22.532 --> 37:24.576
Oh, please, Betty, call me Ellis.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.786
-What?
-Ellis.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.247
Oh, okay.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.166
Yeah. I'm sorry the hearing went so--

37:31.249 --> 37:34.002
Oh, no worries.
Water under the bridge.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.963
Like I said, I brought my car in
for a tune-up.

37:37.047 --> 37:38.423
I can go anywhere.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.139
You made something for me?

38:28.223 --> 38:30.266
No, dude,
I got something made for you.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.435
What, you had something made for me?

38:32.519 --> 38:35.104
All right, so my cousin's
super into decorative pillows, right?

38:35.188 --> 38:36.272
Yeah?

38:36.356 --> 38:37.732
So, I just asked her.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.067
-What do we got here?
-Oh, yeah.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.276
Isn't it dope?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.862
No shit.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.248
Yo, you fucking serious?

38:53.331 --> 38:54.707
Oh, my God.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.128
I had the dream again.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.382
I know.
I know what it is now.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.354
Tell your wife hi, okay?

39:58.438 --> 40:00.398
You have a good one. Okay.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.583
Yo, I hear she's dating a wrestler.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.168
You could so be a wrestler.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.586
Oh, what, you saying I'm short?

40:21.669 --> 40:23.213
Yeah.

40:53.743 --> 40:56.287
Open the door! Help!

41:12.887 --> 41:16.224
Come on, come on, come on!

41:21.354 --> 41:22.397
Betty.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.773
Come on.

41:24.774 --> 41:26.401
Come on.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.531
Oh, my God! No.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.284
My boys.

41:38.038 --> 41:40.415
Cafeteria. Oh.

44:23.328 --> 44:24.620
You did it.

44:25.538 --> 44:27.290
Don't you see?

44:28.958 --> 44:30.876
I have the will.

44:32.170 --> 44:33.546
Can't you feel it?

45:05.870 --> 45:06.912
It's happening.

45:09.290 --> 45:11.334
It's happening.

45:13.878 --> 45:15.045
OA!

45:17.298 --> 45:18.341
OA!

45:19.592 --> 45:21.093
Angel!

45:21.176 --> 45:23.554
Take me with you!

45:29.602 --> 45:32.688
<i>They said it would be... invisible.</i>

45:33.773 --> 45:38.653
<i>Like jumping into an invisible current</i>
<i>that just... carries you away.</i>

46:04.762 --> 46:05.930
<i>Homer?</i>
