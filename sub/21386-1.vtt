WEBVTT

00:07.633 --> 00:09.544
Kane is in the building, nigga...

00:23.191 --> 00:26.058
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top

00:26.152 --> 00:29.690
When only heaven ’3 right above it, we on

00:30.656 --> 00:32.988
’Cause we on

00:33.075 --> 00:35.657
Who else is really trying to fuck
with Hollywood Cole?

00:35.745 --> 00:37.201
I’m with Marley G, bro

00:37.288 --> 00:40.576
Flying Holly Grove chicks
to my Hollywood shows

00:40.666 --> 00:43.533
And / wanna tell you
something that you probably should know

00:43.628 --> 00:46.665
This that
Slumdog Millionaire Bol/ywood flow

00:46.756 --> 00:48.166
And...

00:48.257 --> 00:50.373
My real friends never hearing from me

00:50.468 --> 00:53.710
Fake friends write the wrong
answers on the mirror for me

00:53.804 --> 00:56.511
That’s why / pick and choose
/ don ’t get shit confused

00:56.599 --> 01:00.091
Don ’t like my women sing/e
/ like my chicks in twos

01:00.394 --> 01:02.931
And these days
all the girls is down to roll

01:03.022 --> 01:05.559
/ hit the strip club
and all them bitches ﬁnd the pole

01:06.275 --> 01:09.312
Plus, lbeen sippin’
So this shit is movin’ kinda slow

01:09.403 --> 01:12.816
Just tell my girl
to tell her friend that it’s time to go

01:18.871 --> 01:20.407
I'm open.

01:21.457 --> 01:23.118
Let's go, Spence. D up! D up, baby!

01:24.085 --> 01:25.200
-(GRUNTS)
-Oh, come on!

01:25.294 --> 01:26.750
You're gonna get hurt, Chuck.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.373
That shit did hurt. It's a foul.

01:28.464 --> 01:30.375
That wasn't no foul.
That's a clean rip. All ball.

01:30.466 --> 01:31.125
CHARLES: WOW.

01:31.217 --> 01:32.297
It's always your ball.

01:32.385 --> 01:34.171
Right. Game point, motherfuckers.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.923
-Let's go.
-What's wrong with him?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.128
You know what? Lock up.

01:37.223 --> 01:38.303
-Back me up.
-I got it.

01:38.391 --> 01:40.222
Step out.
I got the help in the middle.

01:40.309 --> 01:41.810
-I got the help.
-D up. Help me.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.634
Splash! Splash!

01:43.729 --> 01:45.060
-Game.
-Man, that's a charge.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.307
That wasn't no motherfucking charge!

01:46.399 --> 01:47.889
-My house, my call.
-For real?

01:47.984 --> 01:50.066
-Fuck out of my face.
-Always cheating, man.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.141
-l'm gone.
-What?

01:51.237 --> 01:52.852
Yeah, me, too, man. Let's go, Reg.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.778
-Fuck this game.
-Yeah, fuck this game.

01:54.865 --> 01:57.777
Eat your Wheaties. What you
complaining about? You on my team.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.405
-This motherfucker is my ride.
-l'm out of here.

02:00.496 --> 02:02.111
Great game, son.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.197
Thank you, Dennis.
Thank you very much.

02:04.667 --> 02:05.907
Thank you, Rick.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.836
-Loving the pad, man.
-Yeah?

02:07.920 --> 02:10.627
-Hope it's got an infirmary.
-And a full rehab center.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.422
Might need to add a nursery.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.462
What are you talking about?

02:16.804 --> 02:17.919
You remember Amber?

02:18.347 --> 02:19.928
Shorty with the Pac tattoo? Yeah.

02:20.016 --> 02:21.222
Yeah. She's late.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.883
At least I think she is.
She won't call me back.

02:23.978 --> 02:27.095
It makes sense why you're
playing like Draymond Green out there.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.770
I ain't ready for no kid, Spence.

02:28.858 --> 02:31.315
I mean, even if I was,
I wouldn't want one with her.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.142
I mean, she bad as hell and all,

02:33.237 --> 02:35.444
but stability is not her specialty.

02:35.531 --> 02:37.192
I told you a thousand times, Ricky,

02:37.283 --> 02:39.023
you got to cover that little man up.

02:39.118 --> 02:41.359
I thought I did.
I can't remember when I didn't.

02:41.454 --> 02:42.739
Besides, you always bag it?

02:43.122 --> 02:45.534
No, but my pullout
is straight 100, brother.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.870
Come on, man, you ain't never hit
the bull's-eye, not once?

02:48.961 --> 02:51.828
-Never.
-Damn, that's crazy.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.583
Are you sure you got swimmers?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.505
Shit.

02:55.593 --> 02:57.208
I mean, seriously,
how do you know?

03:00.097 --> 03:02.053
How we looking
with that new deal, though?

03:02.141 --> 03:03.677
-We're looking good, man.
-Yeah?

03:03.768 --> 03:06.555
-We were all over New England.
-The hell I'm talking about.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.601
I love when a manager's
ahead of the game.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.678
That other thing?

03:09.774 --> 03:11.890
Don't worry about that.
I'll take care of it.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.646
You promised full payment
of the five mil the first year.

03:14.737 --> 03:17.319
I'm on schedule.
I'm gonna pay you back.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.073
Morning, boss.

03:25.915 --> 03:27.621
There's my man crush Monday!

03:28.876 --> 03:31.117
What the fuck? You okay?

03:31.212 --> 03:33.453
No, I'm not okay.
I'm a little strung out today.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.664
Oh, really? I take it the pick-up game
at Ricky's wasn't relaxing?

03:36.759 --> 03:38.624
Well, he wants to know
how we're looking

03:38.719 --> 03:40.334
with paying back the fucking loan.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.757
Oh, Jesus...

03:45.142 --> 03:46.598
You ever hear that old saying,

03:46.685 --> 03:48.721
"Never lend friends and family money"?

03:48.813 --> 03:50.895
-Yeah.
-Well, maybe the more important adage

03:50.981 --> 03:53.142
-should be don't fucking take it.
-Yeah, okay.

03:53.234 --> 03:55.270
I got three months to
make good on my word.

03:55.361 --> 03:56.646
And I plan on doing so.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.069
Told you not to promise.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.533
Steph Curry's on line 1 for you.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.199
Steph Curry. MVP.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.072
-MVP.
-Take it.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.070
Steph Curry.

04:08.165 --> 04:10.747
The baby-faced assassin.
What's going on, brother?

04:11.210 --> 04:12.871
What up,
Spency-Spence-Spency—Boo?

04:12.962 --> 04:14.372
What's going on?

04:14.463 --> 04:16.545
Hey, me and Ayesha
got a couple of days off.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.793
We're going down to
the Albany in the Bahamas.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.715
Hey, Spence.
Grab a girl, come with us.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.794
Hey. Well, I'll tell you
right now, Ayesha,

04:22.888 --> 04:25.345
I'm a little light on
travel companions these days.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.513
Spence, don't play me.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.431
I saw you on your game the other night

04:28.519 --> 04:29.634
at International Smoke.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.593
Buy one, get one,
Hot Wing Tuesday.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.270
Or in your case,
Hot Girl Tuesday.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.688
-I never forget.
-Ha. Gotcha.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.891
Nothing gets past my girl
at that restaurant.

04:36.986 --> 04:39.568
No, I heard that.
But, brother, I am in time-out.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.156
It's a very sad but true story.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.322
Hey, well, we'll be
in Miami for the night.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.320
We should get together
and do something.

04:45.411 --> 04:46.992
Love to.
Name the time and place.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.740
We can even talk
some business, too.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.742
You know, my Slyce
digital media company.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.870
Love it. I'm beyond excited.
I will see you tonight.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.542
You, hit me when you touch down.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.369
-Safe travels.
-All right, my man.

04:57.882 --> 04:59.418
You thought it was a date night.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.666
Just trying to get you
in the mile-high club.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.136
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.835
I didn't know you knew
Steph Curry.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.342
I know a lot of guys
you don't know that I know.

05:07.433 --> 05:09.515
I've been chasing after Steph for years.

05:09.602 --> 05:12.435
He'd be the perfect guy to
build our hoops business around.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.558
Ah, so this is the next step
in your global domination.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.560
Well, it's all
about expansion, Joe.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.266
It'll be a good opportunity for us

05:19.361 --> 05:21.693
to pay back Ricky and Vernon
before the end of Q4.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.441
You don't have to justify it to me.

05:23.532 --> 05:26.023
We're both big boys
with big appetites and big balls.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.825
It's just that yours are
a little bit bigger than mine.

05:28.913 --> 05:30.619
I'm gonna take
these big, heavy nuts

05:30.706 --> 05:33.072
and go over
to Anderson's office and loop him in.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.156
Have fun.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.503
It’s that time
of the year again, folks.

05:36.587 --> 05:37.667
Since the Chargers...

05:37.755 --> 05:39.461
You don't wait for a response

05:39.548 --> 05:41.163
before entering the boss's office?

05:41.258 --> 05:42.338
Partner, Mr. Anderson.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.257
Junior partner, Spencer.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.761
Hey, what do you think of all this
NFL expansion talk?

05:47.848 --> 05:51.136
I think it's a big opportunity
for anybody to get their hands into it.

05:51.227 --> 05:52.216
Really?

05:52.311 --> 05:53.721
Mexico, China.

05:53.812 --> 05:56.394
They're really gonna send
the Jaguars to London?

05:56.482 --> 05:58.097
No. Doubtful. Not with Brexit.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.227
Huh.

05:59.652 --> 06:01.108
Who would have thought

06:01.195 --> 06:04.187
such a barbaric business
could be so sophisticated?

06:04.281 --> 06:06.772
Yeah, it's a high-stakes
business, Mr. Anderson.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.823
The future of these cities
depends on it.

06:09.245 --> 06:12.578
Just like the future of ASM depends on
the moves we make here at home.

06:12.665 --> 06:15.122
And what kind of moves
are you thinking of, Spencer?

06:15.209 --> 06:16.415
Steph Curry.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.583
He's flying in and, um,

06:18.671 --> 06:20.878
I thought we'd have dinner
with him tonight.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.957
I have a dinner tonight
with Wayne Hastings, so no can do.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.757
-Sorry.
-The casino guy?

06:25.844 --> 06:28.972
"The" casino guy, Spencer.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.923
One Wayne Hastings
is worth 10 Steph Currys.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.177
-Believe me.
-Okay, well,

06:33.269 --> 06:35.305
we're not in the casino business.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.806
We're in the sports business.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.309
Well, actually, we are
in whatever business

06:39.400 --> 06:40.765
Iwant to be in.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.809
See, I have
a different vision for us,

06:43.904 --> 06:46.486
and that involves
a magical little oasis

06:46.574 --> 06:49.236
in the middle of the desert
known as Las Vegas.

06:49.326 --> 06:52.614
I've been after this Wayne Jr.
prick-fuck-cocksucker

06:52.705 --> 06:55.447
for, like, decades to sell me a stake

06:55.541 --> 06:57.782
in his gaming empire,
and his father before him.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.996
Remember, house always wins.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.453
And Iwant a wing in that mansion.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.505
Athletes and gambling,
itjust... doesn't fit.

07:05.593 --> 07:08.050
Well, it fits for me.
You'll make it work.

07:09.555 --> 07:12.592
(CHUCKLES) Mr. Anderson, I seem
to remember way back when,

07:12.683 --> 07:15.265
when you said you would be
nothing but supportive of us

07:15.352 --> 07:18.094
and you said that you would be
a strategic partner for us.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.645
You even happened to say
that you would be a closer.

07:20.733 --> 07:22.689
I need you to help me
close Steph Curry.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.151
You know what?
We can help each other out.

07:27.239 --> 07:29.981
You use your charms,
help me close Wayne Hastings,

07:30.075 --> 07:33.283
and I will close the two-time MVP.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.576
-Done.
-Good.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.528
Bring him to dinner tonight, 7:00.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.831
-You got it. We'll be there.
-Oh, and, Spencer?

07:38.917 --> 07:40.908
Remember, you may have goals,

07:41.003 --> 07:42.994
but I have...

07:44.381 --> 07:45.632
bigger ones.

07:45.716 --> 07:46.796
Hey, hey, there he go.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.749
-What up, Chuck?
-This our year, Lonnie.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.550
-I'm telling you.
-Yes, you tell it.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.343
CHARLES: Hey, Jack Moore.
How's the off-season?

07:55.434 --> 07:57.095
-You have a good one?
-No, ldidn't.

07:57.186 --> 07:59.142
-Oh.
-I guess that's still going.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.264
What's that mean?

08:00.773 --> 08:03.560
It means Siefert's speech
about family and loyalty

08:03.651 --> 08:05.016
was bullshit.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.104
You got fired?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.068
What gave it away?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.112
The cardboard box
with all my stuff in it?

08:11.200 --> 08:12.280
I'm sorry, Jack.

08:12.368 --> 08:14.029
I didn't mean to sound insensitive.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.075
Man, there's no room
for sensitivity here.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.195
But don't sweat it.
You Siefert's boy.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.791
You got nothing to worry about.

08:19.875 --> 08:20.910
How you figure that?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.787
He plucks you from the trash pile

08:22.878 --> 08:24.493
and moves you to the front office?

08:24.588 --> 08:26.044
Must be a reason for that, no?

08:28.384 --> 08:29.373
Uh...

08:29.468 --> 08:31.299
Have a great season, Charles.

08:33.055 --> 08:35.262
Yo, man, look what
the tooth fairy dropped off.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.931
Who lost a tooth?
I didn't lose no tooth.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.554
This shit is dope.

08:42.189 --> 08:45.181
It's soft as fuck, man.
It feels better than cotton.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.024
Yo, man, feel this shit.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.065
Damn. This is good quality.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.443
But I wasn't expecting
nothing like this.

08:53.534 --> 08:54.774
What's wrong with it?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.574
I mean, this shit is cool, Reg,

08:56.662 --> 08:58.903
but it's a little in-your-face.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.158
Yeah, 200 grand in your face.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.616
I don't know, Reg.

09:03.961 --> 09:05.451
Maybe we should ask Spence.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.121
What the fuck for, man?

09:09.216 --> 09:12.174
We know Spencer's Dr. No.
What's the point?

09:14.012 --> 09:15.968
-Maybe you're right.
-Of course I'm right.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.513
We're not doing wrong
but looking out for ourselves.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.886
Now, if we don't do it,
who the fuck gonna do it?

09:21.103 --> 09:22.343
Spencer would.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.219
He right about that.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.179
Man, who the fuck asked you?

09:26.275 --> 09:28.015
Make a sandwich or some shit.

Why ain't you returning
any of my calls?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.706
Because I don't wanna talk to you.

09:52.801 --> 09:53.881
Don't you think you...

09:53.969 --> 09:55.800
don't you think
you need to talk to me,

09:55.888 --> 09:56.877
given your situation?

09:56.972 --> 09:58.212
-My situation?
-Yeah.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.263
Don't you mean
our situation, asshole?

Hey, no need
to get excited, all right?

10:03.228 --> 10:05.139
ljust wanna know,
are you or aren't you?

10:05.856 --> 10:08.313
So, you aren't here
because you actually care

10:08.400 --> 10:09.856
about me or your unborn child.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.979
You only give a damn
about yourself.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.228
-So that's a yes.
-That's a no, loser.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.359
So you can stop your recon mission.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.483
Oh, you think you're relieved.

I thought I was a master
at precision timing, but, urn,

12:28.206 --> 12:31.073

be the case, and, uh,

be ready for it now, but...

12:39.593 --> 12:42.585
one day down the line,
I might want to plant a seed.

And... And as any good farmer
will tell you,

12:45.098 --> 12:46.804
you plant a seed
and nothing grows,

get you in there.

Right now?

to a rookie.

-I got three houses.
-There you go. Exactly.

-20.
-I have zero doubts about that.

But at some point,
it's gonna end, right?

You got three houses.
Just dump two of 'em.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.518
I'm not dumping my Miami
or my Scottsdale house.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.020
Why? They're both
warm weather places.

13:39.111 --> 13:41.147
Yeah, but one's wet
and one's dry.

-That's the trick.

the Baltimore house, then?

tough adult choices now.

a lot of space now

You know that "no" means
the same in French and English?

14:45.552 --> 14:47.167
Same as the word direction.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.507
I know that "oui" means "yes."

14:51.349 --> 14:53.010

18:43.248 --> 18:45.660
I fucking lost Steph tonight
for Anderson's dinner,

18:45.750 --> 18:49.038
and now I got to text Pat Riley
to see if any of the Heat are in town.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.539
Jesus! (LAUGHS)

18:51.464 --> 18:53.420
When's it gonna end?

18:54.050 --> 18:57.417
Spencer, we run a major
financial institution.

18:57.512 --> 19:00.219
I thought we were done
being party wranglers.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.639
This is why we need
to own our own assets.

19:02.726 --> 19:05.934
Yeah, preferably ones that don't breathe
and tear their ACLs.

19:06.021 --> 19:08.478
All right, I need to find
somebody impressive enough

19:08.565 --> 19:11.056
to help Anderson close
Wayne Hastings Jr. tonight.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.526
Uh, okay. Here's a crazy idea.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.102
How about yourself?

19:17.407 --> 19:18.487
Oh, What?

19:18.575 --> 19:19.781
So you're not 7'9"

19:19.868 --> 19:22.575
and the only thing you dribble
is Don Julio? So what?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.618
Wayne Hastings should fucking blow you

19:24.706 --> 19:27.288
for all the money you've
lost at his tables. (CHUCKLES)

19:27.375 --> 19:30.037
Okay, oh, so you're not
LeBron or Giancarlo Stanton

19:30.128 --> 19:32.460
or Maria fucking Sharapova,

19:32.547 --> 19:34.629
but you're still
Spencer fucking Strasmore.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.173
You are the asset.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.917
(EXHALES)

19:39.596 --> 19:41.006
You just gave me chills, Joe.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.839
(SIGHS) You're absolutely right.

19:45.810 --> 19:46.890
You know what?

19:47.145 --> 19:49.010
If all this isn't
good enough for him?

19:49.481 --> 19:50.516
To hell With him.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.597
Yeah, I admit this?

19:52.734 --> 19:54.690
More than enough for any man.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.648
And besides, what's in it for us?

19:57.739 --> 20:01.402
Well, Anderson's gonna pay off our debt
to Ricky and Vernon. That's it.

20:02.327 --> 20:05.034
Oh, you better close
this Wayne motherfucker.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.244
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

20:21.054 --> 20:22.919
-Hi.
-Was Jack Moore fired?

20:23.014 --> 20:24.879
(INCOHERENT CHATTER)

20:24.974 --> 20:27.260
I'm sorry, one question at a time,
please. Sorry.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.851
Who... Who are you?
What's yourjob title?

20:30.939 --> 20:33.351
I'm Charles Greane, assistant GM.

20:33.525 --> 20:34.640
And, uh...

20:34.734 --> 20:36.110
and...

20:36.403 --> 20:38.860
and today,
the organization made a change

20:38.947 --> 20:40.403
in the coaching staff.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.818
And we are now moving
in a new direction.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.365
And what direction is that?

20:45.495 --> 20:46.575
The opposite direction

20:46.663 --> 20:48.449
of the one
we were moving in before.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.952
-Why are we talking to you?
-Where's Larry Siefert?

20:51.042 --> 20:53.158
Yes. No to you in the back.
And maybe to you.

20:53.253 --> 20:56.211
-What was your question, sir?
-Did Coach Berg sign off on this?

20:56.297 --> 20:57.582
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

20:57.924 --> 20:59.334
Uh, hmm.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.427
(COUGHS)

21:01.511 --> 21:03.797
Chuck, let me. I got this.

21:03.888 --> 21:06.675
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Coach Csonka.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.849
Let me start by saying
there is no power struggle.

21:10.353 --> 21:13.345
This organization stands
linked shoulder-to-shoulder.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.307
I'm here from the coaching side,
representing Coach Berg

21:16.401 --> 21:19.564
and joining Charles
and Mr. Siefert's whole team

21:19.654 --> 21:22.566
in saying we are committed to winning.

21:22.657 --> 21:25.899
And we will stop at nothing
to bring another championship

21:26.161 --> 21:29.244
to our great fans
like we did in the past.

21:29.497 --> 21:31.783
Thank you all very much for being here.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.831
Let's get off the stage.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.455
I didn't mean it when I said
I was gonna have a baby,

21:36.546 --> 21:38.082
you wouldn't be high on my list.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.162
Yeah, I knew that.

21:39.257 --> 21:41.373
Yeah, you did call me out on it.

21:42.135 --> 21:45.878
Truth is I think you'd be
an amazing father.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.384
Everything I do is amazing.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.846
Yeah, you do.

21:52.812 --> 21:53.892
You know what?

21:54.022 --> 21:55.603
If I were gonna have a baby mama,

21:55.690 --> 21:57.271
I'd want her to be just like you.

21:57.859 --> 21:59.815
-For real?
-For real. I mean, look at you.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.734
You gonna have a pretty baby for sure.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.858
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, it makes me
feel so good to hear you say that.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.405
Good. I want you to feel good.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.279
I wanna make you feel good, too.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.984
That's why I wanna be straight up.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.570
Well, you could always
be straight up with me, Amber.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.371
Okay. Well, good.

22:14.626 --> 22:16.708
'Cause I lied when I said
I wasn't pregnant.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.201
lam.

22:20.215 --> 22:23.048
I thought you said you never lie.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.216
Well, I lied When I said that.

22:25.303 --> 22:26.964
Well, are you sure the baby's mine?

22:27.055 --> 22:29.421
-I mean, do you even know?
-It's yours, Ricky.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.006
I haven't been
with anyone else,

22:31.100 --> 22:33.477
and I know your narcissistic ass
can believe that.

22:33.561 --> 22:36.644
Huh! (CHUCKLES) I had to ask.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.184
I'm gonna be by your side
the whole time.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.264
You promise?

22:49.744 --> 22:52.326
-(MUSIC PLAYING)
-(|NCOHERENT CHATTER)

22:55.375 --> 22:57.912
-True.
-Hey, here he is.

22:58.002 --> 23:00.493
Gotta hand it to you, Bret,
you stepped it up.

23:00.588 --> 23:03.045
The scenery is much better
than that gay pride party

23:03.132 --> 23:05.043
-you hosted in Palm Beach.
-(ALL CHUCKLE)

23:05.134 --> 23:07.090
It wasn't a gay pride party.

23:07.178 --> 23:09.089
Yeah. You were with
that crazy Colombian.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.216
That would be my wife,
and she's Slovenian.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.172
-Is there a difference?
-(ALL LAUGH)

23:13.518 --> 23:15.179
-You must be the new partner.
-I am.

23:15.270 --> 23:17.761
Spencer Strasmore,
meet Wayne Hastings Jr.,

23:17.855 --> 23:19.140
the one and only.

23:19.232 --> 23:20.688
It's a pleasure to meet you.

23:20.775 --> 23:22.731
Mr. Anderson says
great things about you.

23:22.819 --> 23:23.854
Yes, I do.

23:23.945 --> 23:27.187
I used to watch your games with
my old man. You were a serious force.

23:27.282 --> 23:29.273
I like to think I could still
light 'em up.

23:29.367 --> 23:30.356
I think you can.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.157
I'm a big fan of your hotels.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.361
As a matter of fact,
every time I'm in Vegas,

23:34.455 --> 23:36.662
uh, I like to heavily contribute.

23:36.749 --> 23:37.955
(ALL LAUGH)

23:38.042 --> 23:39.202
And we appreciate that.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.034
-Sure.
-Hey, can we talk about

23:41.129 --> 23:44.212
that freaky water show
that's at the steak joint?

23:44.299 --> 23:47.382
-That's nasty.
-Wayne, this is my partner, Joe Krutel.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.880
Hey, which makes me
Mr. Anderson's partner as well.

23:49.971 --> 23:51.256
Nice to met you, Joe.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.303
So I hear Steph Curry
won't be joining us.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.131
That's too bad. I'm a big hoops fan.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.727
I know, and I apologize to you,

23:56.811 --> 23:59.268
but you have my word
I'll make it up to you one day.

23:59.355 --> 24:00.344
I promise.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.771
Speaking of that water show,

24:01.858 --> 24:04.645
how is it you keep coming up
with these different concepts?

24:04.736 --> 24:06.067
It's just... it's fantastic.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.519
It's easy, Bret.

24:07.614 --> 24:11.448
ljust close my eyes and dream big.

24:11.534 --> 24:14.401
I did the same thing and Iwound up
working for Mr. Anderson.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.622
Ah, you should dare
to dream bigger, Spencer.

24:16.706 --> 24:19.493
-Ah, there you go.
-(LAUGHS)

24:19.584 --> 24:20.949
We go down table,

24:21.044 --> 24:23.831
and everyone say something
they are grateful for.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.957
And after each, we drink.

24:26.507 --> 24:28.088
Why don't you start us off, Joe?

24:28.343 --> 24:29.378
Okay.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.960
Urn, (CLEARS THROAT) let me see here.

24:32.055 --> 24:36.845
Uh, I... lam, uh...
I'm so very grateful

24:36.934 --> 24:39.391
that, urn... that we live
in a country

24:39.687 --> 24:43.225
where a man is presumed innocent
until he is proven guilty.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.935
And sunny days.

24:50.990 --> 24:54.824
Urn, I'm grateful for piece of world.

24:55.203 --> 24:56.943
I think you mean world peace, hon.

24:57.038 --> 25:00.451
-No, I want piece of world.
-(ALL LAUGH)

25:00.541 --> 25:03.248
You gotta love a woman
who knows what she wants.

25:03.586 --> 25:06.077
Hey, Spencer, why don't you
throw on some Speedos

25:06.172 --> 25:07.833
and dive into the deep end here?

25:08.716 --> 25:09.831
Sure.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.167
All right. (CLEARS THROAT)

25:12.387 --> 25:16.300
Well, I have a lot to be grateful for.

25:16.391 --> 25:18.507
Urn, first and foremost,

25:18.601 --> 25:20.683
I never thought that
I would ever see myself

25:20.770 --> 25:22.635
at a dinner party like this.
(ALL LAUGH)

25:22.730 --> 25:23.719
I mean, ever.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.931
You know, where I came from, uh...

25:26.025 --> 25:28.858
I never thought that I'd make it
past my 21 st birthday,

25:28.945 --> 25:32.654
let alone ever having a life like this.

25:33.449 --> 25:34.700
Is that true?

25:35.952 --> 25:38.443
Have you ever been to
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Wayne?

25:38.538 --> 25:40.745
I think I passed it
on the way to Saint-Tropez.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.493
-Ah.
-(ALL LAUGH)

25:42.583 --> 25:46.701
Well, it sure as hell
ain't sun and sand, my friend.

25:46.796 --> 25:51.256
Uh, Iwas... Iwas, at best,
destined for a life in the mills,

25:51.342 --> 25:53.799
uh, working with my adopted dad.

25:54.262 --> 25:55.468
And what changed?

25:56.013 --> 25:57.344
(SIGHS) Football.

25:58.015 --> 26:00.222
Football gave me a life
that I'm very proud of.

26:00.309 --> 26:04.302
It also gave me a career
that I felt extremely blessed to have.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.597
You're an American success story.

26:08.151 --> 26:10.767
You know, just like
your father and yourself.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.816
The only difference is
after the game...

26:15.241 --> 26:17.527
I found myself right back
where I started.

26:18.661 --> 26:21.653
But as luck would have it,
the universe delivered,

26:21.748 --> 26:24.740
and delivered to me Mr. Anderson.

26:25.293 --> 26:28.126
And without this man,

26:28.212 --> 26:30.544
I wouldn't have the opportunity
that I have today.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.838
So, sir, cheers to you.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.382
-I'm very grateful.
-Wow, wow.

26:35.470 --> 26:36.835
-(ALL APPLAU D)
-Thank you.

26:37.764 --> 26:40.551
I can go on forever
about what I'm grateful for.

26:40.683 --> 26:43.595
But in addition to the race cars,
the speed boats,

26:43.686 --> 26:45.472
the buildings bearing the Wayne name,

26:45.563 --> 26:48.350
I'm grateful for guys like Spencer.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.516
Real men who roll up their sleeves

26:51.611 --> 26:53.442
and grind it out.

26:53.529 --> 26:56.692
So, this is a toast to you,
Spencer. (CHUCKLES)

26:57.241 --> 26:58.777
-(ALL APPLAU D)
-Thank you.

27:00.244 --> 27:01.950

27:07.210 --> 27:08.575
WOMAN: Oh, watch out.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.833
You out here reflecting
on those Bethlehem days?

27:13.925 --> 27:16.166
(LAUGHS) Nah,
just getting a little fresh air.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.513
You gave a good push
on Bret's behalf.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.512
He really should appreciate you.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.303
Ah, just wasn't only on his behalf.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.851
Urn... Anderson's business
is my business,

27:27.939 --> 27:30.271
and he wants in on your business.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.223
Look,VVayne,
you could do a lot worse

27:32.318 --> 27:34.274
than Bret Anderson as your shareholder.

27:34.529 --> 27:36.394
Well, if his business is your business,

27:36.489 --> 27:37.569
-Iet me ask you.
-Yeah.

27:37.657 --> 27:40.649
What can you bring to the table
other than capital and opinions,

27:40.743 --> 27:43.405
because I can raise money
anywhere, Spencer,

27:43.496 --> 27:46.203
and the only opinion I like is my own.

27:47.959 --> 27:48.994
Okay.

27:50.211 --> 27:51.576
Sports, Wayne.

27:51.671 --> 27:53.536
Sports rules the world.

27:54.507 --> 27:57.624
My dad always used to say,
"Pussy rules the world."

27:57.718 --> 27:58.844
(BOTH LAUGH)

27:58.928 --> 28:00.919
Your dad's a smart man.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.220
But, you know, times have changed.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.717
They certainly have.

28:04.809 --> 28:06.845
Anderson's been after me for years

28:06.936 --> 28:09.427
to get into my business,
my father before me.

28:09.522 --> 28:12.855
The truth is he didn't need anyone,
and neither do I.

28:12.942 --> 28:15.354
People will look
to give away money to casinos

28:15.444 --> 28:17.571
from now until the end of time.

28:17.655 --> 28:19.771
But I do like you, Spencer.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.402
SO, who knows?

28:21.492 --> 28:24.234
Maybe there's something else
we can work on in the future.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.490
-Yeah, maybe.
-Yeah.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.373
Wayne, let me ask you something.

28:32.295 --> 28:35.503
How would you feel about
bringing an NFL team to Las Vegas?

28:39.176 --> 28:40.677
I love that idea.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.803
I love that idea.
