11:58.805 --> 11:59.893
How's it goin'?

11:59.980 --> 12:02.069
Great.
Everyone's hungry today.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.592
Oh, that's good.

12:03.679 --> 12:05.507
Anything you want to
tell me?

12:05.594 --> 12:08.162
No. I like your dress.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.947
Thanks.

12:11.034 --> 12:13.471
So, nothing else?

12:13.558 --> 12:15.125
I saw you
a few hours ago.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.692
Not much has changed
since then.

12:16.779 --> 12:17.824
Right.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.698
Hey.
We got your message.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.352
I'm glad you're not
still mad at us.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.136
Course not.

12:26.223 --> 12:27.877
I know you were
just trying to
look out for me.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.490
So, what are we
doing here?

12:32.577 --> 12:34.710
I thought
we could have lunch.
And I'm buying.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.365
Three Jakewiches,
please.

12:39.715 --> 12:42.413
Here.
On the house.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.850
Really?

12:43.937 --> 12:46.417
Yeah, I'm having
a good day. Enjoy.

12:46.504 --> 12:47.854
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

12:57.037 --> 12:59.517
Kelly, I've been
keeping some secrets
from you.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.781
Of course, you have.

13:01.868 --> 13:02.869
I mean, really?

13:02.956 --> 13:04.218
Remember when we
binge watched

13:04.305 --> 13:06.263
the new season of
"Royals of Wembley"?

13:06.350 --> 13:07.482
I had already watched it
by myself.

13:07.569 --> 13:08.962
I couldn't wait.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.572
And remember in
the first grade
when I said

13:10.659 --> 13:12.400
I didn't have any
Goldfish crackers left?

13:12.487 --> 13:13.618
I lied.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.272
I just didn't
feel like sharing.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.361
And while we're at it,

13:17.448 --> 13:19.668
I feel guilty that
I like Amy so much.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.975
[chuckles]
Okay, well, I forgive you,

13:22.062 --> 13:24.238
and don't feel bad
about Amy.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.327
She's a very nice person.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.329
I re-gifted the bracelet
you gave me for Christmas.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.071
It was really nice,
just a little too clinky.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.377
And clunky.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.423
- Sorry.
- I understand.

13:35.510 --> 13:38.687
And there's something else
that nobody knows yet.

13:40.515 --> 13:41.690
I'm not going to
Fox Canyon.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.213
Darby/Kelly: What?

13:43.300 --> 13:45.607
I called our school and
I told them I'm staying.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.827
I don't understand,
I thought you were excited.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.438
Well, I felt left out
when you two rescued
our cookbook

13:50.525 --> 13:51.961
from Chuck's trailer
without me.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.790
Oh, Hannah,
it wasn't like that.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.229
Wait a minute.

13:59.316 --> 14:02.189
Why are we telling you
all of our secrets?

14:02.276 --> 14:03.320
I can explain.

14:03.407 --> 14:04.974
You cooked again,
didn't you?

14:05.061 --> 14:06.019
We're under a spell.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.238
Your lucky T-shirt.
I lost it.

14:08.325 --> 14:11.154
It's a secret spell.
It's not supposed to
affect you guys.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.156
I swear. It was just
supposed to affect Jake.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.158
What's wrong with Jake?

14:15.245 --> 14:16.943
Something's not right
with him.

14:18.683 --> 14:19.902
I think he's
hiding something.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.993
What are you talking about?
He just gave us sandwiches.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.866
Exactly. Jake never
gives his food away.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.868
And he put cilantro
in his Jakewiches.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.347
He hates cilantro.

14:30.434 --> 14:33.002
Oh, and get this.
He said the word groovy.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.700
So? He knows I'm
trying to bring it back.

14:35.787 --> 14:38.616
Kelly, listen to yourself.
You're look for any excuse
to cook.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.357
No, Jake was late
for his shift,

14:40.444 --> 14:41.924
and then he lied
and said that--

14:42.011 --> 14:44.144
that he went to the new
Trudith Winters movie.

14:44.231 --> 14:45.885
But he saw it last week
and hated it.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.538
Hm. Well,
that makes two of us.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.671
No, I'm telling you
he's hiding something.

14:49.758 --> 14:52.239
Okay, so what is it?
What did he tell you?

14:52.326 --> 14:54.589
Well, that's just it,
he didn't.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.983
He's the only one who
didn't tell me his secrets.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.549
Maybe he doesn't have any.

14:58.636 --> 14:59.681
Everyone has a secret.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.599
You didn't listen to
anything we said
this morning, did you?

15:04.686 --> 15:07.732
- I did--
- And then you decided
to ignore it.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.473
You really have
a problem, Kelly.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.521
So, what'd you put
in the spell?

15:13.608 --> 15:16.045
Elysian cumin in a
spill-the-beans recipe.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.656
You even gave it
a name?

15:18.743 --> 15:19.744
Did you write
a riddle, too?

15:19.831 --> 15:21.181
Of course not.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.573
How do you break it?

15:22.660 --> 15:26.012
Well---
I actually don't know.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.448
What?

15:27.535 --> 15:30.059
If you let me see the book,
I can figure it out.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.365
No chance.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.933
You're on a
magical time out.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.935
Darbie and I will figure out
a counter spell.

15:55.084 --> 15:56.520
Want to know
where I'm going?

15:56.607 --> 15:58.131
Not really.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.176
Don't tell Mom,
but I'm meeting a guy

16:00.263 --> 16:02.135
who says he thinks he knows
what happened to Grandma.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.572
What?
How's that possible?

16:04.659 --> 16:06.008
I'm gonna find out.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.879
I'm meeting him
at Mama P's.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.451
Grandma.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.149
I think we have a problem.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.501
We need to find what
ingredients are used

16:20.588 --> 16:23.156
in a recipe that's
opposite to Kelly's
spill-the-beans.

16:23.243 --> 16:26.942
Like a tight-lipped linguine
or a hold-your-tongue...

tongue.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.727
Eww. [chuckles]
That's gross.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.468
But that's the right idea.

16:35.951 --> 16:38.258
That's Rose,
the girl we saw before.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.999
At least her eyes
aren't moving.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.565
That's good.

16:41.652 --> 16:42.958
But she's staring
right at us.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.397
Ugh.

Really weird.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.022
As much as
I hate to say this,

17:03.109 --> 17:05.459
I'm gonna say it
anyway.

17:05.546 --> 17:07.026
Kelly needs to see this.

17:25.653 --> 17:27.394
I'm glad you called me.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.222
It was
the right thing to do.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.050
You don't really think
that this guy could know

17:31.137 --> 17:33.965
anything about...
magic, do you?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.489
Of course not.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.752
I'm sure he's just
some kind of kook.

But I wish your dad
would stop worrying about me.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.104

17:43.801 --> 17:45.325
Can I tell you a secret?

17:45.412 --> 17:47.805
No, Grandma,
you don't have to.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.764
I regret how I used
my morbium.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.681
But you said that you--

17:53.768 --> 17:54.725
I know.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.208
Gina and Ida
were my best friends,

17:59.295 --> 18:01.080
and I loved them.

18:01.167 --> 18:06.041
And I had to find a way
to stop them from hurting
each other.

18:06.128 --> 18:10.176
But when I broke us up,

18:10.263 --> 18:16.834
I gave them no real way of
ever un-spelling themselves,
and...

18:16.921 --> 18:19.098
I was wrong.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.580
Maybe you should tell them
instead of me.

23:42.682 --> 23:44.814
Becky and Gina
aren't here yet.

23:44.901 --> 23:45.772
You guys having
a meeting?

23:45.859 --> 23:47.295
Yeah.

23:47.382 --> 23:48.818
I'm not sure why.

23:48.905 --> 23:51.038
With Chuck gone,
I thought our problems
were over.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.692
Things just got
interesting.

23:52.779 --> 23:55.346
Ooh, gossip.
I gotta hear this.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.087
You won't believe
what we saw in the book.

23:57.174 --> 23:59.176
- It was--
- What's this meeting about?

23:59.263 --> 24:01.657
Don't look at me.
I didn't call it.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.007
Why don't you go home.
I'll close up.

24:04.094 --> 24:06.183
I don't mind
hanging around.

24:06.270 --> 24:08.055
Jake, why don't you
show them the new menu.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.456
Impressive cursive.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.327
Darbie:
"Jake's Heavenly Ambrosia,

24:19.414 --> 24:20.937
"3 Piggies in a Blanket"--

24:21.024 --> 24:23.113
Gina:
This sounds like the food
my mom used to make.

24:23.200 --> 24:26.421
"Tunnel of Fudge."
These all sound amazing.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.684
Thanks.
Well, I got a lot of
cleaning up to do.

24:36.562 --> 24:37.693
Kelly, what's wrong?

24:37.780 --> 24:39.260
[bell jingles]

24:39.347 --> 24:40.609
Is everything
all right?

24:40.696 --> 24:42.219
No, it's not. Look.

24:52.621 --> 24:54.667
It's the same
handwriting.

24:54.754 --> 24:57.191
The person who
wrote this list

24:57.278 --> 24:59.454
wrote this menu
on the chalkboard.

24:59.541 --> 25:02.152
Chuck wrote this list.

25:02.239 --> 25:04.677
My gut's been telling me
that there's something wrong
with Jake.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.069
What are you saying?

25:06.156 --> 25:08.289
The Jake who's
in your kitchen

25:08.376 --> 25:10.770
is not our Jake.

25:10.857 --> 25:12.423
Then who is he?

25:12.511 --> 25:13.512
Both: [whispering]
Chuck.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.862
I still have
a lot of food left.

25:18.212 --> 25:19.343
Anybody hungry?
