Hey, excuse me!

00:47.121 --> 00:48.821
Excuse me!

00:49.523 --> 00:51.724
I've just been on
the internet date from hell.

00:52.726 --> 00:55.028
My car's like a block over.

00:55.596 --> 00:56.829
Would you walk with me?

00:56.864 --> 00:58.498
- Yeah, sure.
- Sure.

00:58.532 --> 01:00.233
Thank you.

What the fuck...?

02:02.096 --> 02:03.763
Grace Travis?

02:09.603 --> 02:11.270
Jackie Hays is a cop.

02:13.006 --> 02:14.674
You anything to tell me?

02:16.510 --> 02:18.111
You ordered the hit on her

02:18.145 --> 02:20.113
and omit to
fucking mention that?

02:20.481 --> 02:21.514
Careful, kid.

02:21.548 --> 02:24.150
What? We're supposed to
be in a partnership.

02:24.184 --> 02:26.152
Travis no longer
carries a badge.

02:27.888 --> 02:29.489
What?

02:29.523 --> 02:32.492
Get your facts straight before
you open that mouth.

02:32.526 --> 02:36.062
- You're supposed to keep me informed.
- I'm informing you.

02:36.096 --> 02:38.331
Whatever Travis is doing
hanging out with Jimmy,

02:38.365 --> 02:40.199
it's got nothing to do
with police work.

02:40.234 --> 02:43.469
A few days ago she started nosing
around that Fed Michael Chen.

02:43.504 --> 02:45.338
I'm going to wait
for your permission?

02:45.372 --> 02:48.274
You're worried about her
uncovering your deals with dad.

02:48.308 --> 02:50.343
Right?

02:50.377 --> 02:52.712
Tony Aldon, the bullets.

02:54.214 --> 02:56.282
She's got to know
about all that.

02:57.251 --> 03:01.487
Which means she's got to know
I tried to take out Dad.

03:02.322 --> 03:03.556
Christ.

03:03.590 --> 03:07.059
She couldn't have told him.
About me.

03:07.861 --> 03:10.830
- He'd have said something.
- Are you sure?

03:10.864 --> 03:14.033
I'm guessing Travis gives
good pillow talk.

03:15.402 --> 03:19.305
Get rid of her now
before she fucks everything.

03:19.339 --> 03:21.007
This is my operation.

03:21.909 --> 03:23.509
I call the shots.

03:23.544 --> 03:25.678
You got a concussion?

03:25.712 --> 03:27.680
25 million dollars,

03:27.714 --> 03:30.283
Michael Chen
informing Oakland PD

03:30.317 --> 03:33.753
how Tony Aldon was
laundering Jimmy's money.

03:33.787 --> 03:35.655
Me informing you.

03:35.689 --> 03:37.723
I brought you into this.

03:37.758 --> 03:39.926
Jimmy lost his wife.
We agree on that.

03:40.794 --> 03:43.029
I didn't choose crazy Alec.

03:43.063 --> 03:45.565
I didn't go to the blacks
or the Chinks.

03:45.599 --> 03:47.400
I chose you

03:47.434 --> 03:51.103
because I thought
you were the future.

03:52.673 --> 03:54.340
Very good.

03:55.542 --> 03:57.210
Except I have the money.

03:58.111 --> 04:01.247
And if you want some more of
it, I suggest you do as I say.

04:02.783 --> 04:04.517
You need to stay focused, kid.

04:06.186 --> 04:08.287
What hurts me will kill you.

04:09.490 --> 04:11.624
You want my protection.

04:11.658 --> 04:13.359
You want Jimmy's operation.

04:14.595 --> 04:17.163
First you
get rid of Grace Travis.

04:17.197 --> 04:20.766
Make sure there's no trail of
blood leading back to your door.

04:37.618 --> 04:39.752
I don't think Max knows
who shot at me.

04:41.588 --> 04:43.789
Maybe somebody else
is running things.

04:43.824 --> 04:45.958
Maybe Max isn't the one
making the decisions.

04:45.993 --> 04:47.793
Yeah, not that decision maybe.

04:47.828 --> 04:52.565
But Michael Chen
and Tony Aldon, Jimmy...

04:53.166 --> 04:54.834
Sam.

04:54.868 --> 04:58.504
Even if he didn't order those
hits, he knows who did.

04:58.539 --> 05:00.573
And he knows
who pulled the trigger.

05:04.344 --> 05:07.313
I have to go back.
Back to Jimmy.

05:07.347 --> 05:09.382
I tell Jimmy that Max
is his traitor.

05:10.284 --> 05:13.386
You tell Jimmy his precious little
son tried to knock him off,

05:13.420 --> 05:15.221
who do you think
he's going to believe?

05:15.255 --> 05:16.956
Max unlocks everything.

05:17.791 --> 05:18.858
Alright?

05:18.892 --> 05:21.627
And if I can't get to him,
maybe Jimmy can.

05:21.662 --> 05:24.230
And maybe Jimmy can get
something out of him.

05:25.532 --> 05:27.166
Well, there goes
my night ruined.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.634
You realize that, don't you?

05:28.669 --> 05:31.437
I'm not going to get any
sleep, worrying about you.

05:38.378 --> 05:40.713
You know,
I don't feel so alone.

05:40.747 --> 05:42.448
You knowing where I am.

06:29.463 --> 06:31.130
Jimmy, we need to talk.

06:50.684 --> 06:53.419
We are putting you
to so much trouble.

06:53.453 --> 06:55.154
Hey, it's fine.

06:55.856 --> 06:58.290
You know, the walls
upstairs are pretty thin,

06:58.325 --> 07:02.128
so if you need anything in the
night, just call out. Okay?

07:02.162 --> 07:03.729
Thanks.

07:03.764 --> 07:06.265
Oh, and if you disappear in
the middle of the night,

07:06.299 --> 07:08.534
don't worry, I'm used to it.

07:14.708 --> 07:17.276
Does Evie know, about us?

07:17.310 --> 07:19.011
(TINNY MUSIC)

07:21.882 --> 07:25.084
No. No,
she doesn't know, okay?

07:25.118 --> 07:26.952
I'm sorry.
It is complicated.

07:26.987 --> 07:30.222
I mean, her mom, it's just...
it's a nightmare right now.

07:30.257 --> 07:33.726
I really should not have
got you involved in this.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.828
- It's such a mess.
- I agreed.

07:37.264 --> 07:39.231
It was my choice.

07:39.266 --> 07:41.400
Okay. Okay.

07:42.803 --> 07:45.404
- I'll get the bedding.
- Thank you. Thank you.

08:01.822 --> 08:04.023
Jonah, the armorer,

08:06.827 --> 08:09.361
he and Max were at Santa
Rita at the same time.

08:12.065 --> 08:13.733
Jimmy, they knew each other.

08:17.037 --> 08:21.974
And Tony Aldon visited Max at least
three times while he was in jail.

08:26.513 --> 08:29.749
And the last visit was
the day before Tony died.

08:34.654 --> 08:36.856
Did he tell you
he was seeing Tony Aldon?

08:43.395 --> 08:46.632
Well, maybe you should ask Max

08:46.666 --> 08:48.367
what happened to your money

08:49.636 --> 08:51.303
and who tried to take you out

08:52.672 --> 08:54.106
and who killed my son.

08:54.141 --> 08:58.310
What did you think? You could
fuck me into believing you?

09:03.550 --> 09:06.085
You asked me
to find your traitor.

09:06.987 --> 09:10.122
And you want to punish me because
you don't like what I found?

09:36.049 --> 09:37.716
Jimmy...

09:39.653 --> 09:41.320
Please, Jimmy.

10:14.054 --> 10:15.721
What the fuck?

10:16.990 --> 10:18.924
Jackie Hays is a cop.

10:24.364 --> 10:26.031
Are you shitting me?

10:26.066 --> 10:27.833
Her real name's Grace Travis.

10:29.135 --> 10:30.870
Can you put the gun down,
please?

10:31.304 --> 10:32.738
When did you find this out?

10:32.772 --> 10:34.340
Tonight.

10:34.374 --> 10:36.075
The gun... Thank you.

10:37.544 --> 10:38.577
How?

10:38.612 --> 10:40.713
One of the guys
at the chess park.

10:41.414 --> 10:44.016
Jackie busted him a few
years ago for dealing.

10:47.454 --> 10:48.921
Are you sure?

10:48.955 --> 10:52.658
Think I'd be standing here in the
middle of the night if I wasn't?

10:55.095 --> 10:56.762
Does Dad know?

11:00.800 --> 11:01.901
I don't know.

11:01.935 --> 11:04.270
Why the fuck are you talking to me?
Go tell him.

11:04.304 --> 11:07.239
He thinks with his dick around Jackie.
You've seen that.

11:07.274 --> 11:08.974
He isn't going to listen to us.

11:09.009 --> 11:10.709
Dad's losing it.

11:11.611 --> 11:15.080
Clay Street... you save his ass.
Everyone knows that.

11:18.885 --> 11:21.120
And now you're the one
who's going to pay.

11:21.154 --> 11:23.756
Yeah? How do you
figure that?

11:23.790 --> 11:25.724
Jackie knows about the hits.

11:27.427 --> 11:30.062
She's biding her time.
She's collecting evidence.

11:30.096 --> 11:34.066
Next thing you know, there's cops
crawling all over this place.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.935
Their filthy hands
in Ruby's bedroom.

11:35.969 --> 11:37.670
Shut up!

11:38.905 --> 11:40.572
It's death row, Alec.

11:43.209 --> 11:44.877
I'm sorry.

11:44.911 --> 11:46.612
That's where you're going.

11:51.051 --> 11:52.952
Alec...

11:52.986 --> 11:56.889
Shut up. Just, wait
a minute, let me think.

12:01.027 --> 12:05.264
You're dead. You're never going
to see your little girl again.

12:07.567 --> 12:09.501
I'll take care of her
and Cathy.

12:11.171 --> 12:13.172
But you've got to
get rid of Jackie.

12:14.808 --> 12:16.675
She's a fucking cop.

12:16.710 --> 12:19.445
She's the bitch who
fucked our family over.

12:24.985 --> 12:27.019
Why me?

12:29.589 --> 12:31.256
What?

12:35.161 --> 12:36.829
Why me?

12:40.166 --> 12:42.001
Okay, I'll do it.

12:44.170 --> 12:45.971
What's the crew going to think?

12:47.273 --> 12:49.308
Alec, the heir apparent,

12:49.342 --> 12:52.778
he can kill his own men but hasn't
got the nerve to off some bitch cop.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.547
I'm doing you a favor.

12:57.484 --> 12:59.151
Giving you all the glory.

13:03.156 --> 13:04.823
Kill her.

13:31.317 --> 13:32.985
I went to the house.

13:34.187 --> 13:35.788
You're not
answering your phone.

13:35.822 --> 13:37.523
Yeah, I wanted some peace.

13:46.499 --> 13:48.167
Max came over last night.

13:49.936 --> 13:51.603
Told me Jackie Hays is a cop.

13:53.106 --> 13:54.773
An undercover cop.

13:55.775 --> 13:57.109
Told me to kill her.

13:57.143 --> 14:01.213
Jesus, you too? How low are you
prepared to fucking go, Alec?

14:01.247 --> 14:04.316
No, I got it.
He was setting me up.

14:04.350 --> 14:07.019
Any fucking garbage to come
between me and your brother.

14:07.053 --> 14:09.621
Why? Why do you feed me
these lies?

14:09.656 --> 14:11.690
He was setting me up
to kill Jackie.

14:12.559 --> 14:15.294
What do you want?
I swear on my kid's life?

14:15.328 --> 14:17.229
Why the fuck
would I make this up?

14:18.731 --> 14:23.635
Oh, no. I'm too stupid
to make this up, huh?

14:24.270 --> 14:25.938
Jesus.

14:26.372 --> 14:28.107
I try and do the right thing...

14:29.542 --> 14:31.210
If you tell anyone,

14:32.278 --> 14:35.180
any fucking one,
that Jackie's a cop...

14:38.017 --> 14:40.853
Holy shit. She is?

14:42.255 --> 14:43.922
Jackie is a cop and you knew?

14:45.258 --> 14:47.359
When were you going to
mention it, Dad?

14:47.393 --> 14:50.596
When I was strapped to the gurney
with three fucking needles in my arm?

14:50.630 --> 14:52.764
- She won't do anything.
- I'll go down for murder.

14:52.799 --> 14:54.633
That's not what
she's interested in.

14:55.535 --> 14:58.770
You put that bitch before me?

14:58.805 --> 15:00.205
Before my family?

15:00.240 --> 15:01.773
- No.
- Come on.

15:01.808 --> 15:05.844
Ever since I can remember, even as a
kid, nothing I did was good enough.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.921
So I don't have Max's brains.

15:17.323 --> 15:18.757
But I'm here.

15:18.791 --> 15:21.160
Ever day. Making it happen.

15:22.095 --> 15:25.130
I'm not at college playing
at being a businessman.

15:25.165 --> 15:28.400
I'm not in Santa Rita for
wailing on a police officer.

15:28.801 --> 15:31.403
And I'm not fucking
an undercover cop.

15:31.437 --> 15:33.172
No.

15:35.175 --> 15:36.842
One fucking word, Dad.

15:37.977 --> 15:39.645
Thanks.

15:41.014 --> 15:42.948
How much would
that have cost you?

15:45.018 --> 15:46.952
No, you couldn't even
spare that.

15:47.921 --> 15:49.588
I swear to God,

15:50.623 --> 15:52.324
sometimes you look at me

15:52.358 --> 15:55.360
like you scraped me off the
bottom of your goddamn shoe.

16:00.066 --> 16:04.036
(Door opens and shuts)

16:08.541 --> 16:10.709
Great, that's it.

16:10.743 --> 16:12.444
Okay.

16:14.914 --> 16:16.582
That's right.

16:17.317 --> 16:18.984
I hope you're not starving.

16:20.753 --> 16:22.988
Breakfast might be
quite some time.

16:23.022 --> 16:24.423
No, it's okay.

16:29.996 --> 16:31.663
Look,

16:34.434 --> 16:37.569
I applied for a position
in Ferndale.

16:42.842 --> 16:44.509
Ferndale?

16:45.545 --> 16:47.546
It's about 200 miles
north of here.

16:49.282 --> 16:51.950
Before or after...

16:53.019 --> 16:55.787
I got the prospectus
about a week ago.

16:58.258 --> 17:00.692
So you already knew
you were leaving.

17:00.727 --> 17:02.427
No, no, I, well...

17:03.162 --> 17:06.498
I hadn't...
I hadn't totally decided.

17:08.401 --> 17:10.068
And now you have.

17:14.007 --> 17:17.976
Look, Shelley, my life
is a mess right now.

17:18.011 --> 17:19.411
You don't need me telling you.

17:19.444 --> 17:22.948
You took a right hook to the jaw
from my kid, for Christ's sake.

17:25.984 --> 17:27.853
I thought you were
working it out.

17:27.887 --> 17:29.588
Ferndale is not that far.

17:31.457 --> 17:33.992
Wait until you get there
before you say that.

17:35.461 --> 17:37.129
I'm sorry.

17:51.644 --> 17:53.312
What happened?

17:55.181 --> 17:56.848
Talk to me.

17:57.517 --> 17:59.751
- Baby...
- I finally do the right thing,

17:59.786 --> 18:01.153
I finally fucking talk to him

18:01.187 --> 18:02.821
and he throws it back
in my face.

18:02.855 --> 18:04.556
- Who?
- Who do you think?

18:06.125 --> 18:07.492
Jimmy.

18:07.527 --> 18:09.828
Max was playing me.
He was setting me up.

18:10.630 --> 18:12.030
What, about Jackie?

18:12.065 --> 18:14.966
- So she's not a cop?
- Yeah, she is.

18:15.001 --> 18:17.369
He was trying to get me
to get rid of her.

18:17.403 --> 18:19.104
Do it for him.

18:20.873 --> 18:22.541
So I took it to Dad.

18:23.776 --> 18:26.545
- What did he say?
- He blew up.

18:26.579 --> 18:28.547
Took Max's side
as he always does.

18:29.048 --> 18:32.984
I swear to God, if I see my brother one
more time, I am going to fucking...

18:33.019 --> 18:34.886
What are you doing?

18:36.322 --> 18:38.590
Alec. Baby, talk to me.

18:38.624 --> 18:42.394
I'm getting out of here before I
do something I'm going to regret.

18:45.665 --> 18:47.332
Call me, Jimmy.

18:50.670 --> 18:52.337
Have you spoken to Max?

18:53.873 --> 18:57.909
Cos if you have, I need
to know what he said.

19:00.646 --> 19:03.148
You're angry. I get it.

19:03.883 --> 19:05.550
Please.

19:07.553 --> 19:09.187
Please just call me.

19:13.860 --> 19:15.527
You sound desperate.

19:16.362 --> 19:18.029
Yeah, I am desperate.

19:20.066 --> 19:21.733
You got anything on Max?

19:21.768 --> 19:25.237
Uh-uh. No.
One offence, no priors.

19:26.072 --> 19:30.208
No drunk driving, no grad pranks.
Nothing. The guy was a saint.

19:32.578 --> 19:35.580
Have the Feds come back with
anything new on Michael Chen?

19:35.615 --> 19:38.950
I talked to a guy who put me onto a
woman who put me onto his handler.

19:38.985 --> 19:40.252
And?

19:40.286 --> 19:42.687
He said that before he could
give me any of the details

19:42.722 --> 19:46.024
on a money-laundering operation
that Chen was involved in,

19:46.058 --> 19:47.793
he had to take it upstairs.

19:47.827 --> 19:50.729
You're letting yourself get dicked around.
You know that?

19:50.763 --> 19:53.231
What am I supposed to do,
sleep with the guy?

19:53.266 --> 19:55.066
Jesus.

20:01.140 --> 20:02.641
What?

20:02.675 --> 20:05.377
- I...
- What?

20:06.379 --> 20:08.246
No, you wouldn't
have done that.

20:10.450 --> 20:12.384
Shit.

20:12.418 --> 20:14.119
You slept with Jimmy Laszlo?

20:14.754 --> 20:16.555
Fuck off, Mitch.
Of course not.

20:31.571 --> 20:32.971
Not to get information.

20:33.005 --> 20:34.906
Stop.
I don't want to hear it.

20:34.941 --> 20:36.842
Yeah, you wouldn't understand.

20:57.230 --> 20:59.931
Must be pretty serious if
you want to meet out here.

20:59.966 --> 21:01.666
Yeah.

21:07.073 --> 21:12.277
Tony Aldon was sweating like a pig the day
he signed the lease on these offices.

21:14.013 --> 21:16.348
Said I was playing
above my league.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.351
Someone would take me out
within a year.

21:19.852 --> 21:24.189
Me, I...
I just saw the future.

21:29.695 --> 21:35.166
Now, I hear Tony came to
see you in Santa Rita.

21:35.735 --> 21:37.402
The week he died.

21:39.705 --> 21:42.641
I was thinking of starting
up in business on my own.

21:43.543 --> 21:45.210
And Tony offered to help me.

21:46.579 --> 21:47.946
You never mentioned it.

21:47.980 --> 21:49.681
I wanted to surprise you.

21:50.917 --> 21:54.052
You do too much for me, Dad.
I've been coasting.

21:54.086 --> 21:56.121
I think it's time
I made it on my own.

21:56.923 --> 22:00.091
Someone whacks Tony,
the money's missing...

22:00.126 --> 22:04.296
You'd seen him a couple of days
before and you still don't tell me?

22:04.330 --> 22:07.566
Well, right then I didn't think
my plan was that important.

22:09.168 --> 22:11.303
Everything you do
is important to me.

22:16.576 --> 22:19.711
What kind of business are you
thinking of moving into?

22:20.279 --> 22:23.515
Well, I'm considering
my options.

22:23.549 --> 22:25.317
Yeah? Alright.

22:26.352 --> 22:31.323
Now, in my experience,
options need money.

22:31.357 --> 22:33.058
Yeah?

22:35.861 --> 22:40.565
25 million would pay
for a lot of options.

22:51.110 --> 22:52.777
What?

22:54.847 --> 22:57.182
Whoa, okay, where's this
coming from?

22:59.752 --> 23:01.419
Is this Jackie?

23:03.255 --> 23:04.923
Jackie's a cop, Dad.

23:05.925 --> 23:07.592
She's an undercover cop.

23:08.194 --> 23:09.861
How do you know she's a cop?

23:31.150 --> 23:34.786
She asked me out a couple
of times. Drinks, dinner.

23:35.955 --> 23:38.490
The bitch came onto me.
Did she mention that?

23:39.492 --> 23:41.226
She's been playing us
off each other.

23:41.260 --> 23:43.161
She's trying to
tear us apart, Dad.

23:43.195 --> 23:45.997
Your mother and me
were so proud of you.

23:45.999 --> 23:50.835
How could we produce a child so
sure of himself, so confident?

23:50.870 --> 23:54.806
Not needy or begging
for attention like Alec.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.208
Jackie, Dad, she's
the fucking problem.

23:57.243 --> 23:58.943
Nothing ever was your fault.

23:59.512 --> 24:03.882
Even as a child you blamed your brother
for any little thing that went wrong.

24:03.916 --> 24:06.951
All the time acting... It
was eating your heart out.

24:10.890 --> 24:12.957
How come Maddie and I
never saw that?

24:13.559 --> 24:16.294
Even now you're using Alec
to do your dirty work.

24:16.729 --> 24:18.263
Is that what he told you?

24:18.297 --> 24:19.831
He came to me.

24:19.865 --> 24:21.833
After you visited him
last night.

24:24.537 --> 24:27.439
Your scheme didn't work, Max.

24:27.473 --> 24:29.708
You can't trust
what that savage says.

24:30.710 --> 24:32.377
Not over me.

24:33.746 --> 24:36.347
He cuts off people's heads,
Dad.

24:37.016 --> 24:38.550
You think that's leadership?

24:38.584 --> 24:42.420
He made a mistake. At least he
was trying to put it right.

24:43.289 --> 24:45.457
Max, Max, Max...

24:45.491 --> 24:48.193
what you and I have,
it's too precious to waste.

24:48.661 --> 24:51.463
Tell me the truth.
Tell me the truth.

24:51.497 --> 24:54.632
Please. I can forgive you.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.367
Alright?

25:06.612 --> 25:08.279
A bank?

25:09.682 --> 25:12.217
You seriously thought
I'd want to run a bank?

25:15.087 --> 25:16.755
What happened to you?

25:18.224 --> 25:19.958
Charlie and Tony sold you out.

25:21.026 --> 25:22.994
It's no wonder.
Look at you.

25:23.829 --> 25:26.498
Letting some bitch jerk
you around by the dick.

25:31.904 --> 25:33.371
What?

25:33.405 --> 25:35.106
Huh...

25:35.741 --> 25:37.408
You wanted the truth, Dad.

25:38.477 --> 25:40.145
Look at you.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.380
You're a monster.

25:43.616 --> 25:45.283
In a tailored suit.

25:49.021 --> 25:50.755
How did you think I'd turn out?

26:04.804 --> 26:06.471
If you'd have asked,

26:09.608 --> 26:12.243
I'd have given you everything.

26:40.706 --> 26:43.341
When I'm with him, I'm Jackie.

26:46.579 --> 26:49.047
And for a while
I don't feel the pain.

26:53.118 --> 26:55.386
What happens
once you find your killer?

27:01.460 --> 27:02.961
(Cellphone)

27:04.296 --> 27:05.964
Yeah? Speaking.

27:09.134 --> 27:11.002
I appreciate that.
Yup, thanks.

27:13.272 --> 27:15.740
The Feds came good on an
address for Michael Chen.

27:16.809 --> 27:20.044
An office building they were running
a money-laundering operation out of.

27:20.079 --> 27:23.114
The corner of Ellis and
Hyde, South San Fran.

27:23.148 --> 27:25.383
That's where Chen
arranged to meet me.

27:27.152 --> 27:29.153
What exactly
did Chen want anyway?

27:30.122 --> 27:32.390
Background intel
on Jimmy Laszlo?

27:32.424 --> 27:36.227
Hernandez put him onto Wilson,
Wilson got lazy and had me go.

27:36.262 --> 27:38.429
Think Chen had something
to tell you?

27:39.565 --> 27:41.332
It can't have been urgent.

27:41.367 --> 27:43.601
The meeting was set up
two days before.

27:44.637 --> 27:46.304
Wilson said, 10 minutes max.

27:48.841 --> 27:51.943
Let's go see if the office
is still in operation.

27:51.977 --> 27:55.213
Someone there might be able
to tell me what Chen wanted.

27:59.385 --> 28:01.052
Okay, you think I'm a whore.

28:03.022 --> 28:06.491
Well, if you want to sit there
sulking, I'm not going to beg.

28:06.525 --> 28:08.960
You can stop with
the charm offensive now.

28:16.001 --> 28:18.403
I haven't come this far
not to get a result.

28:42.528 --> 28:45.129
- This is it, this is the building.
- Uh-huh.

28:46.465 --> 28:50.201
It's looking like maybe the Feds
packed it up and relocated, huh?

28:50.669 --> 28:52.870
The operation died
with Michael Chen?

28:53.605 --> 28:55.273
Maybe.

28:57.276 --> 28:59.677
I'm going to get onto
Chen's handler here.

29:14.660 --> 29:16.327
- Hey.
- Mitch.

29:16.662 --> 29:18.096
What?

29:21.266 --> 29:23.468
Whatever happened,
it happened here.

29:24.436 --> 29:25.636
Where?

29:25.671 --> 29:28.873
Remember I told you
that I was off duty

29:28.907 --> 29:31.642
and I went to get Sam
from soccer practice.

29:31.677 --> 29:32.944
I was going to take him home

29:32.978 --> 29:36.280
but Tom was running late, so
I had to bring Sam with me.

29:36.315 --> 29:37.882
So we parked here, right.

29:37.916 --> 29:40.518
I was going to get
Michael Chen, come back.

29:40.552 --> 29:42.253
I was gone a few minutes.

29:43.856 --> 29:45.723
And I left Sam
drawing in the car.

29:47.993 --> 29:49.660
What are you saying?

29:50.429 --> 29:52.096
Sam was in the car.

29:55.167 --> 29:57.301
A week, I don't know,
a few days later,

29:58.337 --> 29:59.837
he drew this.

30:00.139 --> 30:03.741
He drew a dragon and then
he drew another one.

30:04.543 --> 30:06.210
And another, and another.

30:07.046 --> 30:08.913
You know, kids get crazes,
right?

30:09.114 --> 30:10.782
That's what I thought.

30:11.717 --> 30:13.785
But then he started
wetting the bed.

30:15.287 --> 30:16.988
The doctor said it was fine.

30:17.022 --> 30:18.756
He said that, you know,
it was a phase,

30:18.791 --> 30:20.825
that maybe someone
at school or...

30:26.965 --> 30:28.633
I gotta go home.

31:30.129 --> 31:31.796
I want you down this end.

31:33.232 --> 31:34.899
You're doing a great job.

31:38.770 --> 31:42.140
- Kick it here.
- I'm trying.

31:42.174 --> 31:43.875
(Cellphone rings)

31:52.184 --> 31:53.784
- Hello.
- 'Tommy...'

31:53.819 --> 31:57.722
Before Sam died he was drawing
those dragons. Remember?

31:58.323 --> 31:59.757
'And he was
wetting the bed.'

31:59.791 --> 32:02.193
Are you okay?
Where are you?

32:02.227 --> 32:04.428
'Was there anything else
that he said?

32:04.463 --> 32:06.197
Try and remember.

32:06.231 --> 32:08.032
Did he say
that he'd seen something?'

32:08.667 --> 32:10.334
Something bad.

32:13.405 --> 32:16.674
No, he...
he told me nothing.

32:16.708 --> 32:22.046
He'd just nod and say sorry for
wetting the bed.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.048
- Yeah.
- 'Just like he did with you?'

32:25.317 --> 32:26.984
He just kept saying sorry.

32:32.257 --> 32:33.925
I wasn't listening.

32:35.194 --> 32:37.328
'I was hearing,
I wasn't listening.'

32:38.130 --> 32:39.664
Has something happened?

32:41.433 --> 32:45.336
There was a star
on the dragon's neck.

32:47.139 --> 32:48.673
Did he say anything about that?

32:48.707 --> 32:50.408
'No. No, not to me.'

32:51.476 --> 32:53.144
Maybe he said something
to Evie.

32:53.178 --> 32:54.378
Is she there?

32:54.413 --> 32:56.280
Yeah, she's here.
I'll ask her.

32:56.315 --> 32:59.584
- 'It's okay, I'll call her.'
- Grace, no.

32:59.618 --> 33:01.185
I'll ask her.

33:04.623 --> 33:06.290
Can we come home yet?

33:06.892 --> 33:08.559
Soon.

33:10.696 --> 33:12.630
You stay at your mom's
last night?

33:17.202 --> 33:18.869
Shelley's.

33:19.238 --> 33:20.905
Shelley?

33:21.640 --> 33:23.040
You mean the teacher?

33:23.075 --> 33:25.142
'Yes.'

33:25.177 --> 33:29.013
Look, Evie's upstairs in the guest
bedroom next to Shelley's bedroom

33:29.047 --> 33:30.948
and I'm downstairs
on the couch.

33:33.051 --> 33:34.785
Which is cool, so, you know...

33:36.355 --> 33:39.056
'You know, it's comfy
for a couch. Yeah.'

33:47.766 --> 33:49.433
As long as you're both safe.

33:56.942 --> 33:58.609
Fuck.

34:03.849 --> 34:06.617
See you all again here this
time next week. Good job.

34:06.652 --> 34:08.918
Hey, sweetheart,
you did good. You did good.

34:08.954 --> 34:10.621
Absolutely.

34:10.656 --> 34:12.356
- Here you go.
- Shelley.

34:12.824 --> 34:15.059
Hey. I guess we'll see you
back at the house.

34:15.092 --> 34:16.560
- Sure.
- Okay.

34:16.594 --> 34:18.228
Come on, let's go.

34:18.263 --> 34:20.130
You did good.

34:20.165 --> 34:22.466
Better than I ever was,
that's for sure.

34:24.503 --> 34:28.205
So, I just got off the
phone with your mother.

34:29.241 --> 34:31.775
And she was asking about the...

34:32.678 --> 34:35.980
the pictures that Sam was
drawing before he died,

34:36.014 --> 34:38.683
the one of the dragon.
You remember that one?

34:38.717 --> 34:41.585
Did he say anything
about that to you?

34:41.620 --> 34:43.087
No.

34:43.121 --> 34:46.657
Did he ever say anything about being
afraid or scared of something?

34:46.692 --> 34:48.726
Sometimes he'd
sneak in with me.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.594
You know, if he...
wet himself.

34:52.063 --> 34:53.731
You never told us about that.

34:54.533 --> 34:56.400
Me and Sam
never talked about it.

34:57.469 --> 35:00.071
He'd hold on tight and sneak
back when he heard the alarm.

35:00.105 --> 35:01.872
Why didn't you say something?

35:02.607 --> 35:04.275
Cos he came to me and not you.

35:05.444 --> 35:07.378
Your brother loved you
very much.

35:08.246 --> 35:10.181
I didn't love him.

35:11.216 --> 35:12.883
Not all the time.

35:13.318 --> 35:15.720
I mean, he could be
pretty annoying and...

35:16.421 --> 35:18.889
- Mom liked him more than me.
- She did not.

35:18.924 --> 35:21.058
- That makes me a bad person.
- Hey, hey.

35:21.093 --> 35:23.961
It does not make you
a bad person.

35:24.896 --> 35:28.199
It makes you an honest person.
That's all.

35:30.736 --> 35:33.137
You love someone sometimes,
you just...

35:34.439 --> 35:36.107
You forget why.

35:36.742 --> 35:38.409
That's all. Okay?

35:39.311 --> 35:41.645
So if you die,
who's gonna have me?

35:42.914 --> 35:44.248
What?

35:45.150 --> 35:46.784
Mom doesn't want me.

35:46.818 --> 35:49.120
Uncle Jack's
already got his own kids.

35:49.154 --> 35:50.855
Grandma's too old.

35:51.723 --> 35:53.524
I mean, Shelley likes me but...

35:54.426 --> 35:56.026
That's only because of you.

35:57.496 --> 35:59.397
Who'd have me?

35:59.431 --> 36:02.066
- There's no-one.
- Sweetheart, listen to me.

36:03.301 --> 36:05.870
I have no intention
of dying, okay?

36:05.904 --> 36:07.605
Yeah, neither did Sam.

36:31.696 --> 36:33.364
- (Ringing tone)
- 'Yeah?'

36:34.399 --> 36:36.000
It's me.

36:36.034 --> 36:37.368
What?

36:37.402 --> 36:40.070
'I think my parole's
about to be revoked.'

36:40.105 --> 36:42.573
- Why?
- Just put it in the system.

36:45.210 --> 36:47.545
Yeah, okay.

36:48.313 --> 36:49.713
That's good to know.

36:49.748 --> 36:51.449
Thanks for calling.

36:58.123 --> 36:59.323
(Bleeping)

37:18.143 --> 37:19.810
(Phone rings)

37:28.987 --> 37:30.221
Yeah?

37:30.255 --> 37:32.923
I got all the Laszlos flagged.
An alert's just come in.

37:32.958 --> 37:35.993
Max Laszlo's wanted
on parole violation.

37:36.795 --> 37:38.329
What?

37:38.363 --> 37:42.266
Yeah, it seems he missed a meeting
with his supervising officer.

37:42.300 --> 37:43.667
They put a warrant out for him.

37:43.702 --> 37:46.971
- They'll drag his ass back
to Santa Rita tomorrow. - No, no.

37:47.005 --> 37:49.940
If they do that then I lose
him for a year, minimum.

37:49.975 --> 37:52.476
'He's not going anywhere. You
can talk to him inside.'

37:52.511 --> 37:58.010
Come on, Mitch. He made me. Like he's
going to agree to see me, let alone talk.

37:58.550 --> 38:01.085
He and everything he knows will
be locked up together.

38:01.119 --> 38:04.822
- Think Jimmy could have something on him?
- 'He won't return my calls.

38:04.856 --> 38:06.557
Where is Max?'

38:08.493 --> 38:10.494
You could have sat on this,
Mitch.

38:10.529 --> 38:13.831
But you didn't.
You called me.

38:14.799 --> 38:18.302
Come on, you're a good cop.
You're one of the best.

38:18.336 --> 38:20.170
Don't tell me you didn't check.

38:21.239 --> 38:23.908
Cell site has him located
at the docks.

38:23.942 --> 38:25.643
He's on Jimmy's pier.

38:26.378 --> 38:28.045
The pier. Are you sure?

38:29.347 --> 38:31.215
'Think it's a trap?

38:32.450 --> 38:35.953
- Travis...'
- Maybe. I don't know.

38:35.987 --> 38:37.154
I'm coming with you.

38:37.188 --> 38:39.390
'No, it's too late.
I'm close.

38:39.424 --> 38:42.393
- Thank you for offering.'
- Just... Don't do this.

38:42.427 --> 38:43.627
Please, don't do this.

38:43.662 --> 38:45.429
Mitch, you're not the bad guy.

38:46.965 --> 38:49.433
Why should you be the one
hiding in the shadows?

38:49.467 --> 38:50.935
Huh?

38:50.969 --> 38:53.871
You want to take your boy
to the diner, don't you?

38:53.905 --> 38:56.106
Listen, he's got
the home field advantage.

38:56.141 --> 38:58.042
You don't know what
you're walking into.

38:58.076 --> 38:59.710
Yeah.

38:59.744 --> 39:01.845
- 'Look, I'm begging you.'
- Yeah.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.847
- 'I'm begging you.'
- Alright.

39:03.882 --> 39:06.884
I know you want to get him. Fine.
This is not the way to do it.

39:06.918 --> 39:08.719
No, I hear you.

39:09.220 --> 39:13.357
Maybe we can figure out
another way to flush him out?

39:13.391 --> 39:14.558
I'm serious.

39:14.593 --> 39:16.694
Alright, alright,
I'm not going.

39:18.997 --> 39:23.500
Why don't... Why don't I
come over to you?

39:24.502 --> 39:27.638
'We'll figure something out.
I'll be there in an hour.'

39:28.239 --> 39:29.907
- Okay?
- 'Okay.'

40:22.360 --> 40:24.294
Come on, you fucking
bitch, move.

40:53.925 --> 40:55.592
That's it.

40:59.097 --> 41:01.765
Keep going, keep going.

41:05.670 --> 41:07.337
A little further.

41:08.006 --> 41:10.240
A little further.

41:11.342 --> 41:13.110
A little further.

41:14.412 --> 41:16.080
Come on.

41:20.485 --> 41:22.486
That's it. That's it.

41:41.706 --> 41:43.373
(Whistles)

42:04.062 --> 42:05.729
- Agh!
- Ugh!

42:06.097 --> 42:07.765
(Groans)

42:18.376 --> 42:20.043
Parole violation, huh?

42:20.311 --> 42:22.446
That's a bit fucking
convenient, Max.

42:23.481 --> 42:25.716
What, your source
didn't tell you?

42:25.750 --> 42:28.519
I know all there is to know
about playing someone.

42:29.454 --> 42:31.121
You little bitch.

42:32.290 --> 42:34.358
- Get the fuck up.
- I'm not going anywhere.

42:34.392 --> 42:36.527
You just fucking broke my leg!

42:36.561 --> 42:39.062
Ah, little baby Max
has hurt his little knee.

42:39.097 --> 42:42.232
- I said get the fuck up.
- Okay, okay.

42:42.967 --> 42:44.168
Okay.

42:44.202 --> 42:46.503
I'm up. Where are we going?
Are we going for a drive?

42:46.538 --> 42:47.905
Now move, you little bitch.

42:47.939 --> 42:50.774
What? How exciting. Where
are you taking me, huh?

42:53.778 --> 42:56.213
This could take some time,
Jackie.

42:56.247 --> 42:58.248
Or is it Grace?
Can I call you Grace?

42:58.283 --> 43:02.019
- Come on!
- Argh! Fucking bitch.

43:04.856 --> 43:06.557
Crawl. Come on. Come on.

43:06.591 --> 43:09.193
What are you doing? You're not
even a cop any more.

43:09.227 --> 43:10.928
Come on!

43:11.529 --> 43:13.197
Agh, you fucking bitch.

43:14.065 --> 43:16.033
Agh. What is it, huh?

43:16.067 --> 43:18.735
Is it Jimmy? Huh?
Is it my dad?

43:19.170 --> 43:20.771
Do you love my dad?

43:20.805 --> 43:22.506
Do you want his babies?

43:24.242 --> 43:26.043
What the fuck do you want,
Grace?

43:27.846 --> 43:32.115
I want to know
why you had my son killed.

43:32.150 --> 43:33.483
- Move.
- Okay...

43:33.518 --> 43:34.685
Move!

43:34.719 --> 43:40.324
So, hang on, all this is about
some fucking kid?

43:41.726 --> 43:44.328
Some kid I never even
fucking heard of!

43:46.030 --> 43:48.565
Do you know how long
I've been planning this?

43:50.668 --> 43:52.336
You screwed my plans.

43:56.274 --> 43:57.941
You turned my dad against me.

43:59.244 --> 44:02.379
All for some fucking little
snot-nosed dead kid?

44:02.413 --> 44:04.114
Argh!

44:04.949 --> 44:06.250
Fuck!

44:06.284 --> 44:10.454
Sam. He had a name.

44:14.692 --> 44:17.060
Well, if you're going for
pathos, I wouldn't bother,

44:17.095 --> 44:20.631
because I don't... I don't know
anything about love.

44:21.699 --> 44:24.134
I don't know anything about...

44:26.938 --> 44:28.639
Sam? Agh!

44:30.441 --> 44:33.911
Now stop fucking lying.

44:35.079 --> 44:38.949
If I were lying, it would be
a much better lie than that.

44:40.785 --> 44:43.253
I don't know anything
about your son.

44:44.155 --> 44:46.990
I didn't kill your son, I
didn't have your son killed.

44:48.192 --> 44:52.162
Now if you're going to kill me for something
I didn't do, Grace, go right ahead.

45:02.740 --> 45:04.408
Argh!

45:07.378 --> 45:09.046
You know who killed him.

45:10.882 --> 45:12.549
You just didn't order it.

45:14.752 --> 45:18.088
So before you kill me, come on.

45:18.356 --> 45:20.023
Tell me,

45:20.725 --> 45:23.699
1whose bitch are you?
