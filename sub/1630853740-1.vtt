00:51.835 --> 00:55.100
With the Indians!

01:32.542 --> 01:33.770
Avram !

02:20.089 --> 02:22.250
I want to talk to you in private.

02:23.693 --> 02:25.593
Speak only English.

02:26.529 --> 02:30.226
And no matter what I say, don't smile.

02:42.212 --> 02:46.740
Out of 88 students graduating
from this yeshiva...

02:47.250 --> 02:49.912
you came in a close 87.

02:52.822 --> 02:53.811
Don't smile.

02:56.159 --> 02:57.524
Look sad.

03:00.563 --> 03:02.531
There is a new congregation...

03:02.599 --> 03:03.623
In America?

03:03.700 --> 03:05.065
Wait!

03:16.913 --> 03:20.849
<i>Some meshuggener suggested your
name to become the new rabbi.</i>

03:22.752 --> 03:26.711
I am forced to take an official
vote of the board of rabbis.

03:58.988 --> 03:59.977
Close.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.624
It's a close vote.

04:04.193 --> 04:06.184
But I am the Chief Rabbi!

04:07.030 --> 04:09.498
I am the one who has to decide!

04:10.533 --> 04:12.057
So, cowboy...

04:13.303 --> 04:16.567
I am sending you to San Francisco.

04:19.475 --> 04:21.807
- Where is San Francisco?
- By New York.

04:31.554 --> 04:33.112
Get out, quick.

04:42.265 --> 04:46.964
<i>And so, on a wonderful
sunny day in 1850...</i>

04:47.036 --> 04:50.199
<i>I started out my great adventure...</i>

04:50.273 --> 04:53.538
<i>and I left Poland for Philadelphia...</i>

04:53.609 --> 04:57.101
<i>the city where all the
brothers love each other...</i>

05:41.257 --> 05:42.849
The boat's gone.

05:47.630 --> 05:48.961
Understand?

05:49.032 --> 05:50.465
Somebody should have told us!

05:50.533 --> 05:51.625
This is the devil's work.

05:51.701 --> 05:53.362
- What'd he say?
- Says the boat is gone.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.870
Mister, what'd you just say
about the boat to San Francisco?

05:55.938 --> 05:57.030
- Gone!
- Well, that can't be.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.404
That boat's supposed to leave
first tide in the morning!

05:59.475 --> 06:00.806
Supposed to?

06:00.877 --> 06:02.640
What the hell's the matter with you?

06:02.712 --> 06:04.077
It's a gold rush.

06:04.213 --> 06:06.306
Haven't you people heard anything?

06:06.382 --> 06:08.873
- Next boat two months.
- Oh, God!

06:09.118 --> 06:10.881
Oh, my God, help me!

06:11.821 --> 06:14.449
Just this morning me and
my brother got the news.

06:14.524 --> 06:16.116
All right. Who's next?

06:21.364 --> 06:24.595
Our mama's dying in San Francisco.

06:25.334 --> 06:27.268
What am I gonna do?

06:27.437 --> 06:32.272
There must be some way that a
person can go to San Francisco...

06:32.341 --> 06:33.865
in another way than the boat.

06:33.943 --> 06:35.570
Not for us, sir.

06:35.912 --> 06:40.281
Just 10 minutes ago, me and my brother
sold our horses and our wagon...

06:40.349 --> 06:43.614
so as we could purchase
tickets on this here boat.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.345
And now we ain't got neither.

06:46.422 --> 06:48.913
Well, perhaps if you go to the man...

06:49.058 --> 06:51.822
and you told him your troubles
and you give him back the money...

06:51.894 --> 06:53.987
he would give you back the wagon.

06:54.797 --> 06:56.264
You think he'll do it?

06:56.332 --> 06:59.665
If he is a good man, I
think he would do that, yes.

06:59.735 --> 07:03.136
Mister, would you help me, please?

07:03.372 --> 07:06.307
I'm not much good at
explaining myself and...

07:06.676 --> 07:10.942
I usually just start to cry.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.344
I will do that.

07:12.415 --> 07:13.814
I would be happy to do it.

07:13.883 --> 07:16.249
But I don't know if I
would be much help to you.

07:16.319 --> 07:17.786
<i>With the way I speak English...</i>

07:17.854 --> 07:20.015
Wait, you don't have
to carry the bags.

07:20.089 --> 07:21.920
My brother, his name is Matt.

07:21.991 --> 07:24.152
- Oh, say, what's your name?
- Avram.

07:24.227 --> 07:26.195
Avram. My name's Darryl, Darryl Diggs.

07:26.262 --> 07:28.526
Anyway, my brother's got a temper.

07:28.598 --> 07:30.725
Sometimes he just unloads,
you know what I mean?

07:30.800 --> 07:32.734
- Can't I help you to carry...
- No, that's all right.

07:32.802 --> 07:34.326
I've got it all. Don't
worry about a thing.

07:34.403 --> 07:36.803
Just step in here, anyway. Come
on, what is it again, Avrum?

07:36.873 --> 07:39.273
Avram. But you didn't
do nothing wrong.

07:39.842 --> 07:42.811
- Everything go all right?
- Well, we missed the boat.

07:43.446 --> 07:45.414
- What?
- The boat sailed yesterday.

07:45.481 --> 07:49.349
The whole town's gone crazy, Matt.
It's gold rush. It sailed yesterday.

07:49.852 --> 07:51.649
Yeah, but what are
we supposed to do now?

07:51.721 --> 07:55.122
Well, God may be on our side yet,
Matt, thanks to this here gentleman.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.416
Avram, this is my
brother, Matthew Diggs.

07:57.493 --> 07:59.620
- How do you do?
- Mr. Jones!

08:00.429 --> 08:04.229
Mr. Jones, we missed our boat and we
find ourselves in a desperate state.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.824
We need our horses
and our wagon back...

08:05.902 --> 08:09.463
so as we can get to San Francisco
to see our mum before she dies.

08:09.672 --> 08:12.163
So if you'd be kind enough
to take your money back...

08:12.241 --> 08:15.642
I sympathize with your misfortunes,
fellows. But you've got to understand...

08:15.711 --> 08:18.236
I'm in the business of
buying and selling...

08:19.048 --> 08:21.744
and I don't sell unless
I can make a profit.

08:22.185 --> 08:24.710
But we don't have no
money to give you a profit.

08:24.787 --> 08:26.687
Then we don't do no business.

08:27.490 --> 08:30.721
Excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

08:32.562 --> 08:36.498
How much profit do you
need from these gentlemen?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.423
$50.

08:38.668 --> 08:41.534
$50. That's it, Matt, we're sunk.

08:41.671 --> 08:44.139
I'm sorry, Avram. Sorry
I wasted your time.

08:44.740 --> 08:48.437
Well, perhaps I could pay the $50.

09:00.423 --> 09:02.357
It's real kind of you, Avram.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.757
I don't know how's we could
ever pay you back. Do you, Matt?

09:06.395 --> 09:09.193
$50, look, I don't know.

09:09.565 --> 09:12.193
If I could have a seat on
your wagon to San Francisco...

09:12.268 --> 09:14.259
I would be more than paid back.

09:14.537 --> 09:15.799
Well, you pay the $50...

09:15.871 --> 09:19.034
you could have a seat with a
cushion on it. Can't he, Matt?

09:19.542 --> 09:20.736
All the way.

09:21.277 --> 09:23.006
I would share the cushion.

09:24.413 --> 09:27.143
Matt, the Lord is smiling
on you and me today!

09:27.216 --> 09:28.342
Amen.

09:29.719 --> 09:31.346
Gentlemen, quiet!

09:32.221 --> 09:34.189
Wonderful, marvelous news.

09:35.591 --> 09:38.151
Just this morning, I
received this letter.

09:41.530 --> 09:43.589
"Dear Mr. Bender:

09:43.666 --> 09:47.329
"This is to inform you
that soon, God willing...

09:47.703 --> 09:50.433
"you will have a rabbi and a Torah.

09:56.178 --> 09:59.375
"Rabbi Avram Belinski
has left Poland...

09:59.448 --> 10:02.315
"to join you in the
village of San Francisco.

10:02.952 --> 10:06.410
"Avram thanks you for the
picture of your lovely family.

10:06.689 --> 10:11.251
"He is looking eagerly forward to
meeting your daughter Sarah Mindl...

10:11.327 --> 10:13.420
"with an eye towards matrimony."

10:15.231 --> 10:18.257
- Papa !
- Not now, Sarah Mindl.

10:19.435 --> 10:20.663
But, Julius!

10:21.637 --> 10:23.002
Go to your room.

10:23.406 --> 10:24.896
What's the matter with Sarah Mindl?

10:24.974 --> 10:28.603
Bender, a rabbi is
better than a Rosensheine.

10:45.428 --> 10:46.952
You want a bite?

10:47.029 --> 10:48.326
Oh, thanks.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.344
There she is, Avram.

11:07.483 --> 11:09.644
That little shortcut I
was telling you about.

11:09.719 --> 11:12.552
Gonna get us to San
Francisco four days earlier.

11:12.621 --> 11:13.645
Good.

11:52.528 --> 11:53.517
Whoa !

11:53.629 --> 11:55.529
What happened? Is it Indians?

11:55.598 --> 11:57.429
Mr. Jones, what's happening?

12:04.473 --> 12:06.600
<i>I don't understand. What's...</i>

12:06.675 --> 12:09.109
Darryl, tell him I paid the $50!

12:09.612 --> 12:11.273
He paid the $50.

12:11.447 --> 12:13.915
- You paid the $50?
- Yeah, I did.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.648
Is it clothes what you want?

12:23.726 --> 12:25.455
You want to take my clothes?

12:25.528 --> 12:28.463
You need my clothes so much?
You don't have your own clothes?

12:31.367 --> 12:34.461
No! No! Not the Torah, please!

12:34.537 --> 12:36.505
<i>Take my money, you can have the...</i>

12:36.572 --> 12:39.097
God! God, help me!

12:39.241 --> 12:41.471
Mr. Jones, please don't do that!

12:44.814 --> 12:48.181
Please! Please! No!

12:48.250 --> 12:50.218
What's you need my tallis for?

12:53.322 --> 12:55.051
Why are you doing this?

12:55.124 --> 12:56.421
- We love you.
- Mr. Jones...

12:56.492 --> 12:58.357
why are you doing this?

12:58.427 --> 13:00.793
- You're not happy with our service?
- No.

13:04.600 --> 13:09.264
God! I don't want to be
with these filthy crooks!

13:09.338 --> 13:12.000
- We'll fix that for you, bucko.
- No!

13:12.074 --> 13:13.541
There you go!

13:27.590 --> 13:30.491
- How'd we do?
- I got the rest of his money.

16:32.174 --> 16:34.665
This you couldn't throw out first!

16:58.067 --> 16:59.159
America.

17:34.036 --> 17:36.630
Landsmen! Landsmen!

17:36.805 --> 17:38.238
Hello!

17:39.708 --> 17:41.107
Landsmen!

17:42.277 --> 17:43.266
Landsmen!

17:43.445 --> 17:44.605
Hello!

17:46.281 --> 17:47.578
Landsmen!

18:23.986 --> 18:26.511
Dost thou speak English?

18:29.725 --> 18:31.215
Dost thou...

18:32.895 --> 18:34.795
<i>speak...</i>

19:22.978 --> 19:25.173
You know, I think he's crazy.

20:17.766 --> 20:19.256
We have decided...

20:19.601 --> 20:23.367
that thou shouldst have this
money for the train to Akron.

20:28.744 --> 20:31.269
We are sorry it cannot be more.

20:33.315 --> 20:37.479
We all hope it will help
thee on thy journey...

20:38.086 --> 20:39.485
Brother Avram.

20:45.928 --> 20:50.524
I will never forget thy kindness.

20:53.402 --> 20:54.596
Thanks.

21:07.249 --> 21:10.878
Bye-bye.
Good-bye, children.

21:12.921 --> 21:16.516
Good-bye. Thank you very much.

21:17.559 --> 21:18.617
Thanks.

21:18.694 --> 21:22.095
- Good-bye. -
Good-bye, Avram.

21:24.666 --> 21:26.759
My parents have a farm...

21:26.835 --> 21:30.601
not big like this one,
but they have a nice farm.

21:31.273 --> 21:33.503
How is it that thou are not a farmer?

21:34.776 --> 21:36.835
Well, God made me a rabbi.

21:37.579 --> 21:39.843
- Why?
- Why?

21:41.616 --> 21:44.107
I think he had enough farmers.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.914
What a wonderful country.

22:12.247 --> 22:15.683
Simple Simon says, "Put
your fingers on your nose."

22:18.020 --> 22:20.511
Simple Simon says, "No laughing."

22:21.757 --> 22:25.887
Simple Simon says, "Put
your fingers on your nose."

22:26.395 --> 22:28.158
I really have to go!

22:30.332 --> 22:33.529
Simple Simon says, "Put
your fingers on your nose."

22:35.337 --> 22:37.237
Don't bother the man, honey.

22:39.007 --> 22:42.204
Simple Simon says, "You
don't have to play."

22:49.317 --> 22:51.615
I think we're an hour and a half away.

23:41.036 --> 23:44.494
- Mommy, I'm getting sleepy.
- Then take a nap.

24:25.080 --> 24:27.674
- Can you stop it?
- Mama, I'm hungry.

25:10.125 --> 25:13.561
Ladies and gentlemen, can I
have your attention, please?

25:13.762 --> 25:15.525
Now I want you all to
stay calm and listen...

25:15.597 --> 25:17.565
'cause I'm only gonna say this once.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.628
First thing is: don't turn around.

25:22.270 --> 25:24.397
There's a man behind
you with a big shotgun...

25:24.472 --> 25:26.633
and he don't care to be recognized.

25:27.842 --> 25:30.538
Them that don't
believe me is gonna die.

25:32.247 --> 25:35.808
All right now. You all put
your hands on top of your heads.

25:36.518 --> 25:38.918
Good. That's real good.

25:39.754 --> 25:42.484
Now we're all gonna play
like we're in church.

25:43.258 --> 25:45.317
You got something for
the collection, sir?

25:46.194 --> 25:47.422
Very kind.

25:48.363 --> 25:50.558
Ma'am? Thank you.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.463
Thank you very much.

25:52.601 --> 25:53.590
Ma'am?

25:59.741 --> 26:00.833
Thank you.

26:01.776 --> 26:03.937
Well, thank you all very much.

26:04.012 --> 26:06.810
Mr. Jake, I'm jumping here,
you go at the next bend.

26:07.215 --> 26:08.682
Remember, folks...

26:08.750 --> 26:12.117
the best way to keep your heads
is keep your hands on top of them.

26:12.187 --> 26:13.779
And don't turn around.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.891
Better to give than to
receive, ain't it, folks?

27:14.049 --> 27:18.577
Simple Simon says, "Everybody laugh."

27:27.562 --> 27:29.427
Don't you get the joke?

27:29.497 --> 27:33.593
Simple says, "Everybody gotta laugh."

28:32.494 --> 28:37.022
<i>It's difficult to explain that
a Jew can't ride on a Saturday.</i>

28:37.465 --> 28:41.492
<i>And, for a Jew, Saturday
begins on Friday.</i>

28:43.304 --> 28:45.135
- Name?
- Joseph Pellerton.

28:48.376 --> 28:50.310
See the foreman. Name?

28:51.946 --> 28:53.811
Good? Good.

28:55.884 --> 28:58.546
See the foreman. Name?

28:58.620 --> 28:59.985
You funny looking fellow.

29:00.555 --> 29:03.752
- Yes. Yes.
- See the foreman. Name?

29:04.592 --> 29:05.684
Yes.

29:07.462 --> 29:08.520
See the foreman.

29:08.596 --> 29:12.032
- You ever work on railroad before?
- No. This is the first time for me.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.089
<i>K-O-V...</i>

29:16.037 --> 29:17.026
See the foreman.

29:17.105 --> 29:19.096
- You sure talk funny.
- Name?

29:22.277 --> 29:23.471
- Yes.
- See the foreman.

29:23.545 --> 29:24.569
- Yes.
- Name?

29:24.646 --> 29:25.635
John Browning.

29:25.713 --> 29:27.977
Strange-looking characters
looking for jobs.

29:28.049 --> 29:29.448
See the foreman.

29:30.151 --> 29:31.641
- Name?
- Belinski.

29:47.702 --> 29:50.933
Sorry, Paco. Sorry. It
wouldn't happen again.

29:51.272 --> 29:53.900
You can bet your boots on that.

30:06.921 --> 30:08.218
He did it again.

30:22.270 --> 30:24.795
Wait, Paco. Wait!

30:25.139 --> 30:27.164
Wait, it wasn't done on purpose.

30:27.742 --> 30:31.075
- Avram, some water over here.
- Coming right up.

30:31.346 --> 30:34.110
Got nice, fresh water coming right up.

30:34.682 --> 30:37.480
- Avram.
- What? What happened?

30:37.685 --> 30:39.812
Paco? No!

30:39.888 --> 30:43.619
<i>- It was an accident. I didn't mean to...
- I kill you, pendejo!</i>

30:43.691 --> 30:45.522
I'll bust your Jewish bones!

30:45.994 --> 30:49.088
You smart, you listen.
We open a big restaurant.

30:49.163 --> 30:51.688
You work one year, make
enough money to buy a wagon.

30:51.766 --> 30:53.199
Maybe we even go with you, huh?

30:53.268 --> 30:55.361
Open a big joint in San Francisco!

30:55.436 --> 30:59.133
Paco, would you show
me where to buy a horse?

30:59.541 --> 31:02.669
<i>Hey, pendejo. How you
going to find your way?</i>

31:02.844 --> 31:07.076
Paco, please, just show
me where to buy a horse.

31:11.819 --> 31:16.586
You're crazy, Jew-boy!
You gonna get lost!

31:17.058 --> 31:21.154
Believe me, I won't get lost!

31:21.563 --> 31:24.259
Oh, yes, you will.

31:29.103 --> 31:30.331
Good-bye!

31:31.139 --> 31:33.107
Good-bye, Paco.

31:33.841 --> 31:36.173
Good-bye, Mr. Ping!

31:36.377 --> 31:39.346
Wait! Wait, horsie!

31:39.480 --> 31:41.778
Wait, wait, horsie! Take it easy.

31:42.584 --> 31:46.577
Nice horsie. That's a good horsie.

31:46.688 --> 31:47.780
That's it.

31:48.089 --> 31:50.216
Let's take it slow and easy.

31:51.225 --> 31:53.056
Slow! Slow.

31:53.561 --> 31:55.529
That's it. You're a good horsie.

31:55.597 --> 32:00.500
Sarah Mindl. Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

32:02.270 --> 32:05.637
Oh, my Sarah, Sarah.

32:10.044 --> 32:13.207
Oh, show me what you meant to me.

32:30.732 --> 32:34.691
Oh, my food! My food!

32:44.212 --> 32:45.440
Why me?

32:45.513 --> 32:47.310
My food, you're gonna take?

32:47.448 --> 32:50.315
You got the whole world,
you're gonna take my food!

32:56.691 --> 32:58.158
Not you! Wait!

32:58.226 --> 33:01.457
Not you! Wait! Horsie, wait!

33:03.998 --> 33:05.932
No food and no horse.

33:08.569 --> 33:09.934
Come back!

33:10.004 --> 33:11.699
Come here, horsie!

33:11.773 --> 33:14.298
I'll be good to you! I'll be nice!

33:14.375 --> 33:16.343
I'll pick grass for you!

33:16.444 --> 33:18.275
I'll scratch your back!

33:18.346 --> 33:20.041
I'll give you a nice rub!

33:27.088 --> 33:29.921
Chicken, chicken.
Chickie, chickie, chicken.

33:29.991 --> 33:32.653
Come here. I don't wanna hurt you.

33:32.894 --> 33:34.691
I just want to eat you.

33:39.367 --> 33:42.427
Come here, wait! I
don't wanna hurt you!

33:42.637 --> 33:45.071
I just want to make you kosher!

34:28.483 --> 34:30.143
How hungry are you?

34:32.587 --> 34:34.248
I'm pretty hungry.

34:52.607 --> 34:54.734
If you had been here yesterday...

34:54.809 --> 34:56.777
we could've had roast chicken!

35:03.317 --> 35:05.251
So that's Jewish cooking, huh?

35:06.821 --> 35:08.311
Pretty good, huh?

35:10.858 --> 35:12.587
Where're you coming from?

35:13.995 --> 35:15.121
Back there.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.195
You're from California, huh?

35:22.837 --> 35:24.737
California is that way?

35:28.276 --> 35:30.073
You're lost, ain't you?

35:32.413 --> 35:35.041
- Got any money?
- No.

35:37.318 --> 35:38.910
Got any food?

35:40.254 --> 35:41.243
No.

35:46.460 --> 35:47.859
Sure talk funny.

35:47.929 --> 35:50.261
- Where you born at?
- Poland.

35:52.099 --> 35:54.590
Is that near Pittsburgh?

35:56.003 --> 35:57.994
No. That's near Czechoslovakia.

35:58.873 --> 36:00.306
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

36:02.944 --> 36:04.969
And you're going to California?

36:05.646 --> 36:06.704
Yes.

36:10.284 --> 36:11.979
You ain't gonna make it.

36:13.487 --> 36:14.749
Excuse me...

36:15.590 --> 36:17.888
in the morning, would
you be kind enough...

36:17.959 --> 36:21.190
to point out in which
direction is San Francisco?

36:22.296 --> 36:23.627
- Sure.
- Good.

36:24.799 --> 36:26.494
- In the morning.
- In that case...

36:26.901 --> 36:29.199
would you like to fight
for that last fish?

36:33.107 --> 36:34.301
You think you got a chance?

36:36.410 --> 36:41.347
I think I can say, with complete
confidence, none whatsoever...

36:42.583 --> 36:44.107
but I'm still hungry.

36:45.386 --> 36:47.616
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

36:51.158 --> 36:53.058
What you call this kind of fish?

36:53.895 --> 36:56.955
- That's a trout.
- A trout?

36:58.366 --> 37:00.129
It's got a lot of bones.

37:03.337 --> 37:05.396
You got family waiting for you?

37:05.873 --> 37:08.967
I'm promised a wife when
I get to San Francisco.

37:09.043 --> 37:10.601
But I haven't never met her.

37:10.678 --> 37:13.738
You gonna marry a woman
that you never seen?

37:14.382 --> 37:16.316
I didn't say I never seen her.

37:16.384 --> 37:18.011
I said I never met her.

37:19.353 --> 37:23.016
They sent me a picture
before I left Poland.

37:29.430 --> 37:31.455
Well.

37:31.532 --> 37:32.658
What you think?

37:32.733 --> 37:34.360
Well, that's my kind of woman.

37:34.435 --> 37:35.800
You son of a gun.

37:36.537 --> 37:38.937
You son of a gun, you.

37:40.374 --> 37:41.636
Shee-it!

37:43.544 --> 37:44.875
I guess so.

37:45.112 --> 37:47.239
This other one ain't bad, neither.

37:50.151 --> 37:54.281
- Good night, Rabbi.
- Good night, cowboy.

38:14.809 --> 38:17.277
Well, it's nice meeting
up with you, pard.

38:17.411 --> 38:19.402
Nice meeting up with you, pard.

38:19.847 --> 38:21.838
- You got it straight?
- Oh, sure.

38:21.949 --> 38:23.507
Right from this tree...

38:23.584 --> 38:25.916
I head straight north
five or six weeks...

38:25.987 --> 38:28.012
till I come to the flat country.

38:28.255 --> 38:32.385
- Yeah.
- Then I make a left for two days.

38:32.460 --> 38:34.451
That way I avoid the Indians.

38:35.496 --> 38:37.191
Then I cross the river...

38:38.099 --> 38:41.296
and I make a sharp right,
away from the mountains.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.929
Once I get to the
desert, God willing...

38:46.273 --> 38:49.174
I just continue straight as piss...

38:49.377 --> 38:52.813
till I come to the
ocean. Take a left...

38:53.314 --> 38:55.782
keeping the ocean on
my right shoulder...

38:55.916 --> 38:58.908
and just hot-tail it
right into San Francisco.

39:00.254 --> 39:01.243
Good?

39:02.757 --> 39:03.917
Pretty good.

39:04.892 --> 39:05.881
Well...

39:07.495 --> 39:08.985
I hope you make it.

39:15.169 --> 39:20.163
Okay, wait, horse. Good.
All right, go, horsie.

39:20.975 --> 39:24.877
That's it, straight ahead.

39:28.482 --> 39:33.249
- Speak any Mexican, do you?
- No. Why do you ask?

39:34.555 --> 39:37.649
Oh, nothing. Just curious.

39:39.960 --> 39:44.727
If you should ever come to San Francisco,
I hope that you'll call on me...

39:44.965 --> 39:47.297
and we could talk
over some nice times.

39:53.674 --> 39:56.268
- Come on, horsie.
- Hey...

39:58.512 --> 39:59.979
that way.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.506
That way?

40:05.586 --> 40:07.747
Of course, I know it's that way...

40:08.022 --> 40:11.788
but first I have to go around that
big log before I can go that way!

40:12.093 --> 40:15.927
You mustn't turn a horse so
quick. That's how accidents happen.

40:16.330 --> 40:21.029
You gotta start nice and slow. That
way you get off on the right foot.

40:28.442 --> 40:32.742
Hey! What kind of crazy horses
they got in this country?

40:38.252 --> 40:42.245
<i>- What do you call this in Jewish?
- A tokhes.</i>

40:43.491 --> 40:47.655
<i>Well, you keep your eyes on this tokhes
and don't take them off till I tell you.</i>

40:48.696 --> 40:51.529
<i>Keep my eyes on the tokhes...</i>

40:58.739 --> 41:02.004
Shee-it! Don't get no
closer to that edge, Rabbi.

41:03.811 --> 41:06.245
- What kind of word is that?
- What word?

41:06.413 --> 41:08.973
You always say, "shee-it"
at a certain moment.

41:09.049 --> 41:10.448
Shee-it?

41:12.720 --> 41:16.019
<i>Well, that's a... That's a...</i>

41:16.323 --> 41:20.487
<i>What do you... You must have a
word in your language that you...</i>

41:22.196 --> 41:24.994
What do say when you get
really took by surprise?

41:25.366 --> 41:26.560
<i>Oy gevald.</i>

41:27.434 --> 41:28.423
<i>Oy gevald?</i>

41:28.769 --> 41:33.263
- Yeah. - That's it.
That's what "shee-it" means?

41:36.210 --> 41:37.802
<i>Oy, shee-it!</i>

41:39.046 --> 41:40.843
Yeah, that makes sense.

41:42.216 --> 41:44.844
Slow. Slow, horsie.

41:52.493 --> 41:54.324
Well, this is it.

41:55.696 --> 41:57.926
- Where are you going?
- Back down the river a few miles...

41:57.998 --> 41:59.488
it's a good place to cross.

41:59.833 --> 42:01.460
- Why not here?
- Here?

42:02.503 --> 42:03.800
Here's a good place to die...

42:03.938 --> 42:06.133
but it ain't a good
place to cross the river.

42:06.207 --> 42:10.473
We just jump in and swim
straight across. Simple as pie.

42:12.479 --> 42:14.310
You wanna kill yourself, go ahead.

42:14.381 --> 42:17.077
I don't like the odds.
I'm taking the long way.

42:25.859 --> 42:28.327
Well, that shouldn't be so difficult.

42:38.706 --> 42:42.267
Wait a minute! Where
you going, horsie?

42:42.509 --> 42:45.410
I didn't say where to go yet!

42:47.114 --> 42:48.843
Oh, no! Oh, no!

43:07.334 --> 43:08.995
That snake could've killed me!

43:09.536 --> 43:11.936
Well, damn me! If he
can do it, I can do it.

43:21.315 --> 43:23.715
<i>Help! Oy gevald!</i>

43:24.218 --> 43:25.207
God damn!

43:34.561 --> 43:35.960
Shit!

43:40.701 --> 43:44.137
You know, Rabbi, you're
one crazy bastard!

43:44.638 --> 43:45.627
Remember...

43:45.973 --> 43:50.273
I'm the kind of person when he says
he's gonna do something, he does it.

43:51.612 --> 43:54.809
You got a guarantee, huh? He could
be laying out there somewhere...

43:54.882 --> 43:57.510
- dead in the wilderness!
- Bite your tongue!

43:57.785 --> 44:00.253
You're talking about
my future son-in-law.

44:06.660 --> 44:10.357
Somebody, maybe, should
remind Sarah Mindl.

44:15.969 --> 44:17.334
Rosalie.

44:18.672 --> 44:19.661
Rosalie.

44:20.174 --> 44:24.543
- Get your sister away from that idiot!
- I'm not mixing in. I'm not mixing in.

44:26.880 --> 44:30.680
This is a nice little
town. Cold, but nice.

44:30.984 --> 44:33.214
Yeah, I guess.

44:34.121 --> 44:37.682
I don't think that fellow is 100%.

44:42.262 --> 44:44.526
I'll see if I can find
us some place to stay.

44:47.868 --> 44:51.463
- Someplace pretty cheap.
- Yeah, pretty cheap.

45:20.267 --> 45:21.393
<i>About tomorrow morning...</i>

45:23.070 --> 45:25.004
This ain't traveling weather.

45:25.339 --> 45:29.036
I know this place ain't
fancy, but it's got a roof.

45:29.877 --> 45:32.004
And like you say, it's cheap.

45:34.248 --> 45:36.648
So we just stay here for a
couple months and then head south.

45:36.717 --> 45:39.151
No. I've wasted too much time already.

45:44.725 --> 45:48.183
When they banged on your head,
they must've mushed your brains!

45:48.595 --> 45:52.395
So goddamned worried about time,
how come you don't ride on Saturday?

45:52.566 --> 45:55.729
I told you, it's against my
religion to ride on the Sabbath.

45:56.470 --> 46:00.770
I got me a new religion, too! And one of
the things you ain't allowed to do is die!

46:01.175 --> 46:05.043
There's real mountains out there, and
that's a real blizzard building up.

46:05.112 --> 46:08.240
- I'm telling you we can't make it.
- I can make it.

46:08.882 --> 46:13.876
God damn! I ain't gonna let you talk
me into this. It's just impossible!

46:14.154 --> 46:18.147
Every goddamn Indian knows that!
Every goddamn trapper knows that!

46:21.462 --> 46:24.226
I know, you don't like
it when I talk that way.

46:25.232 --> 46:29.293
But I'm telling you, you ain't
gonna talk me into it this time!

46:31.205 --> 46:34.197
Am I trying to talk you into anything?

46:38.812 --> 46:41.406
Good night! Have a nice trip.

46:42.216 --> 46:46.619
Good night. And thanks for
everything you did for me...

46:47.788 --> 46:50.916
up until the time I
needed you the most!

46:55.195 --> 46:57.095
Don't wake me in the morning!

46:58.999 --> 47:02.230
I'll try to be as quiet as possible!

47:04.938 --> 47:06.963
What do you think now, Rabbi?

47:07.608 --> 47:08.802
It's cold.

47:13.146 --> 47:14.977
You should see it in winter.

47:23.524 --> 47:27.654
<i>In the Talmud it says,
"Find thyself a teacher."</i>

47:28.462 --> 47:30.020
<i>And this I had done.</i>

47:34.668 --> 47:39.196
<i>However, there were times I feared
that he would find another pupil.</i>

47:42.743 --> 47:44.904
Get your horse down!

48:05.198 --> 48:08.429
If we'd have gone on,
we'd have froze to death!

48:09.636 --> 48:11.536
No, make one!

48:14.074 --> 48:17.441
Move! Come here...

48:20.447 --> 48:21.675
closer!

48:24.251 --> 48:25.275
Wait.

48:25.686 --> 48:29.122
We are doing this to
keep warm, aren't we?

48:30.123 --> 48:32.717
In that case, you can
put your arms around me.

48:35.295 --> 48:36.762
Come here, darling.

48:40.467 --> 48:42.025
That's better.

48:51.144 --> 48:52.975
Hey, look.

49:04.191 --> 49:06.682
I think we've found
the Garden of Eden.

49:07.094 --> 49:09.460
Well, it ain't exactly
the Garden of Eden.

49:13.600 --> 49:15.795
What a wonderful place America is!

49:16.303 --> 49:17.964
There are no walls
around these cities.

49:18.038 --> 49:20.734
You don't have to worry about soldiers
coming in from the next town...

49:20.807 --> 49:21.899
and killing people.

49:23.210 --> 49:25.610
You know, I think this is the West.

49:25.879 --> 49:30.248
We're in the Wild West here, just
like the books I read in Poland.

49:31.284 --> 49:35.744
This is a wonderful city. They
got banks and restaurants...

49:36.857 --> 49:41.021
they got merchants of all kinds
here. And look at the people...

49:41.094 --> 49:44.495
how they're dressed. I
think those are cowboys.

49:46.967 --> 49:48.628
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

49:48.769 --> 49:52.967
Hold up here. I got a little
business I wanna take care of.

49:53.273 --> 49:55.298
Hold on to the horses, will you?

49:59.479 --> 50:01.174
I'll be right back.

50:30.210 --> 50:31.438
Move it!

50:32.713 --> 50:35.443
- What's happening?
- We just robbed the bank!

50:35.515 --> 50:38.678
- What did you say?
- We just robbed the bank!

50:40.687 --> 50:42.621
What do you mean, "we?"

50:46.893 --> 50:48.861
The bank, they just robbed the bank!

50:48.962 --> 50:49.951
<i>Oy gevald!</i>

50:53.967 --> 50:56.435
- We need a posse, boys, let's go!
- What for?

50:56.503 --> 50:57.492
I said, we need a posse!

50:57.571 --> 50:59.539
To hell with you! I ain't
got any money in the bank.

50:59.606 --> 51:02.939
- But they robbed it!
- Well go get 'em. It's your bank.

51:03.009 --> 51:05.136
- $5 a man when we catch them !
- $5?

51:05.212 --> 51:06.679
- $7.50!
- Not worth it...

51:06.747 --> 51:08.578
- I'll go for $11.
- $10!

51:08.648 --> 51:11.583
- $11 !
- All right, you bastards...

51:11.685 --> 51:13.482
$11. Let's go!

51:34.207 --> 51:36.141
Don't get comfortable.
We can't stop here.

51:43.980 --> 51:48.212
- How could you do this to me?
- It's what I do. I'm a bank robber.

51:48.418 --> 51:52.184
- But you made me a bank robber!
- So what? You get your half.

51:52.389 --> 51:56.553
- Get out of my life!
- What?

51:58.295 --> 51:59.887
Get out of my life!

51:59.963 --> 52:02.261
Get out! I don't want you here!

52:02.532 --> 52:04.193
Get out of my life!

52:10.207 --> 52:11.196
Take it easy!

52:11.441 --> 52:14.205
Take it easy. You better cool off.

52:27.724 --> 52:29.055
Guns?

52:30.160 --> 52:32.492
You gonna shoot guns at me?

52:34.898 --> 52:35.887
Guns!

52:46.710 --> 52:50.840
- You know, you're really crazy.
- Sure I'm crazy. I'm a bank robber.

52:50.914 --> 52:52.905
Who else would rob a bank but a crazy?

52:52.983 --> 52:55.884
You, you ain't no bank robber.
All you did was hold the horses.

52:55.952 --> 52:58.216
- Think I could tell them that?
- Sure!

52:58.555 --> 52:59.902
- And would they listen?

53:00.003 --> 53:03.070
- Yeah, they'll listen.
Then they'll hang you!

53:03.593 --> 53:06.756
- And what if I gave back the money?
- You mean, your half?

53:09.199 --> 53:12.999
- Yes, I mean my half!  - First they'll
string you up by your balls...

53:13.069 --> 53:16.732
till you tell them where the other
half is, then they'll hang you!

53:21.411 --> 53:23.572
Make up your mind, pardner.

53:39.229 --> 53:40.218
<i>Oy gevald!</i>

53:41.064 --> 53:43.658
Go fast, horsie! Go fast!

53:43.934 --> 53:46.494
Wait, Tommy, wait! I'm coming.

53:53.810 --> 53:55.505
Looks like fresh tracks.

53:55.679 --> 53:58.512
They was here all
right. Here's some blood.

53:58.882 --> 54:01.373
Hey, that was me. I
knew I got that one.

54:01.918 --> 54:04.751
If you did, he sure took a
long time to start bleeding.

54:04.821 --> 54:08.279
All right, let's go, men. Let's
look for a tree for the hanging.

54:24.567 --> 54:27.127
Hey. Hey!

54:28.704 --> 54:30.262
Another river?

55:05.207 --> 55:08.904
- I wish that we could build a
bigger fire.  - Well, we can't!

55:09.378 --> 55:12.745
We're lucky to have this much.
They ain't that far behind us.

55:12.982 --> 55:16.042
By sunrise they're gonna
catch on to my dumb-ass trick.

55:17.153 --> 55:21.852
There, that ought to
warm you up. $320 each.

55:21.957 --> 55:23.049
Not bad, huh?

55:29.765 --> 55:30.959
Now ain't you something.

55:31.600 --> 55:34.228
To tell you the truth, I never
figured you's gonna take the money...

55:34.303 --> 55:36.100
tainted and all, like it is.

55:37.239 --> 55:40.640
So you're rich. What are
you gonna do with it all?

55:43.179 --> 55:46.307
When we get to the next town,
I'm going to send it back.

55:48.451 --> 55:52.285
Well, I'd be careful till
then. It's dangerous out here.

55:53.355 --> 55:55.346
Fella could get hisself robbed.

55:57.993 --> 56:00.689
I'll keep out a watch for strangers.

56:16.178 --> 56:17.645
About ready.

56:30.559 --> 56:32.959
Church over. We'd better make tracks.

56:37.066 --> 56:39.694
I figure they know pretty
much where we're at.

56:43.005 --> 56:45.565
It ain't gonna take
them too long to find us.

56:46.242 --> 56:48.574
Hold still. Hold
still, horsie. Be good.

56:48.811 --> 56:50.904
We can't really afford
such a late start.

57:00.422 --> 57:04.222
- What the hell are you doing?
- I don't ride today.

57:06.595 --> 57:08.324
What're you talking about?

57:09.131 --> 57:11.565
- Today is Saturday.
- So?

57:11.867 --> 57:15.268
- I don't ride on Saturday.
- Well, I know that. But don't tell me...

57:15.337 --> 57:18.773
- you ain't gonna ride today?
- I ain't gonna ride today.

57:19.141 --> 57:22.406
- I asked you not to tell me that!
- That's what I'm telling you.

57:22.478 --> 57:25.311
But this ain't no ordinary Saturday!

57:27.650 --> 57:31.108
Why is this Saturday different
from all other Saturdays?

57:31.387 --> 57:35.050
'Cause this Saturday, there's
a hanging-posse chasing us!

57:38.761 --> 57:42.060
I promise you. Right now, they're
doubling back to that stream.

57:42.131 --> 57:44.895
I don't ride on Saturday!

57:45.267 --> 57:48.065
Jesus! You give me the P-doodles!

57:49.872 --> 57:52.397
There ain't no Jews in
that posse, you know!

57:52.474 --> 57:55.773
They'd as soon string you up
on Saturday as any other day!

57:55.845 --> 57:59.212
They don't give a shit for your
holiday, don't you know that?

58:00.282 --> 58:02.512
Goddamned if I'm gonna walk!

58:05.421 --> 58:07.821
I've asked you not to say that.

58:14.964 --> 58:17.626
You stupid, ignorant, son of a bitch!

58:18.400 --> 58:21.198
I ain't waiting around
for that posse to find us!

58:22.738 --> 58:25.832
- I'm leaving!
- Who's asking you to stay?

58:26.141 --> 58:27.608
Good-bye!

58:37.419 --> 58:38.477
There it is.

58:57.740 --> 58:59.731
I'm gonna show you something.

59:02.578 --> 59:03.943
Look over there.

59:06.415 --> 59:08.007
You know what that is?

59:09.685 --> 59:10.674
Yes.

59:12.121 --> 59:13.110
Well?

59:16.425 --> 59:18.052
When the sun sets.

59:19.628 --> 59:21.027
Know what you are?

59:21.997 --> 59:23.726
You're a real meshigoonu.

59:27.903 --> 59:28.892
<i>Meshuggener.</i>

59:37.513 --> 59:40.846
They're coming. Damn you!

59:42.151 --> 59:43.675
- Come on.
- They're coming.

59:45.754 --> 59:47.517
Now?

59:48.991 --> 59:50.288
Not yet!

59:52.194 --> 59:53.354
Now?

59:55.831 --> 59:56.820
Not yet.

59:57.132 --> 59:58.121
Now!

01:00:12.481 --> 01:00:14.608
- Now!
- Thank God.

01:00:21.657 --> 01:00:23.249
Longest damn day of my life!

01:00:30.065 --> 01:00:32.397
That tree is a apple tree.

01:00:45.447 --> 01:00:48.814
Hot. It's hot.

01:00:57.993 --> 01:01:00.962
- Will you quit that! They ain't coming.
- How do you know?

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:05.296
'Cause it's been four days. I'm telling
you they ain't coming. Now just relax.

01:01:06.268 --> 01:01:07.667
What's that?

01:01:10.939 --> 01:01:12.930
Them's Indians. Let's go!

01:01:14.143 --> 01:01:15.235
Go, horsie!

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.571
Let's go! They ain't serving
tea, you know, you idiot!

01:01:22.351 --> 01:01:24.216
Go, horsie.

01:01:26.855 --> 01:01:28.254
Shee-it!

01:01:30.659 --> 01:01:35.358
Quick! Go quick, horse! Can't
they see that we're friends?

01:01:46.008 --> 01:01:47.873
What did they want?

01:01:51.046 --> 01:01:54.573
They wanted our horses, our
guns, our scalps, our heads.

01:01:55.684 --> 01:01:58.619
Jesus, I don't know. They wanted
our asses, that's what they wanted.

01:01:58.687 --> 01:02:00.018
But, why? What did we do?

01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:03.690
They've been shit on by white men so
long they don't ask questions no more.

01:02:04.226 --> 01:02:08.128
They wasn't painted up for one of your
bar matzavahs, I can tell you that.

01:02:08.397 --> 01:02:12.231
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God!

01:02:12.734 --> 01:02:14.224
- What's the matter?
- Oh, my God.

01:02:14.336 --> 01:02:16.065
- What's the matter?
- Oh, God!

01:02:16.338 --> 01:02:19.739
<i>- The Torah...
- Wait! Wait, damn it! Wait!</i>

01:02:22.077 --> 01:02:24.170
I ain't going with you
this time, goddamn it!

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.341
- Let go!
- That was war paint...

01:02:26.415 --> 01:02:28.406
- you stupid ignoramus!
- Let go!

01:02:28.484 --> 01:02:30.611
- They won't talk, they'll just kill you!
- Will you let go?

01:02:30.686 --> 01:02:32.415
I ain't going, you son of a bitch!

01:02:32.488 --> 01:02:34.581
Who's asking you?

01:02:37.259 --> 01:02:38.749
So long, sucker!

01:02:40.596 --> 01:02:42.029
Have a nice funeral!

01:02:43.098 --> 01:02:45.066
You dumb asshole!

01:03:05.787 --> 01:03:08.620
Oh, come on, get me out of this.

01:03:08.957 --> 01:03:11.357
Oh, please, please, please.

01:03:12.094 --> 01:03:17.031
I'm your friend. I don't
wanna die. Please, God...

01:03:43.325 --> 01:03:45.088
I never did anything wrong.

01:03:47.996 --> 01:03:49.896
How did I get into this?

01:04:13.055 --> 01:04:17.856
- Who the hell are you?
- Me, rabbi...

01:04:19.394 --> 01:04:21.157
Jewish rabbi.

01:04:22.598 --> 01:04:26.728
Come from far away across big ocean.

01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:29.897
I read much books about Indians.

01:04:33.609 --> 01:04:36.237
You don't speak English very well.

01:04:44.519 --> 01:04:48.615
He's a holy man, Chief. Speaks to the
spirits every morning and every night.

01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:52.353
And he's so good and kind and
gentle, just a sweetheart of a man.

01:04:52.594 --> 01:04:55.085
Why, even when we robbed the bank
and the posse was chasing us...

01:04:55.163 --> 01:04:57.324
he wouldn't ride on
Saturday. No sirree!

01:04:57.399 --> 01:05:00.129
'Cause that's his holy day and he
didn't wanna make his spirits angry.

01:05:00.369 --> 01:05:04.430
- Can he make rain?
- Rain, rain?

01:05:06.441 --> 01:05:07.703
You should've seen the rain...

01:05:07.776 --> 01:05:09.937
I mean buckets of rain
coming down day after day.

01:05:10.012 --> 01:05:12.913
I didn't know what the hell we
were gonna do with all the stuff.

01:05:12.981 --> 01:05:16.348
- And if you wanna talk about snow...
- Don't talk about snow!

01:05:20.155 --> 01:05:24.455
- You came for this?
- Yes!

01:05:25.727 --> 01:05:28.525
I have read this book.

01:05:31.333 --> 01:05:33.494
Did not understand one word.

01:05:40.876 --> 01:05:44.175
- What do you call this book?
- Torah.

01:05:49.384 --> 01:05:51.079
The Torah.

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:52.644
Torah.

01:05:52.854 --> 01:05:53.980
Good.

01:05:58.694 --> 01:06:01.595
Will you trade your horse for Torah?

01:06:06.268 --> 01:06:08.793
- Yes.
- Your horse and your boots?

01:06:09.538 --> 01:06:11.802
- Yes.
- And your clothes?

01:06:12.507 --> 01:06:13.633
Yes.

01:06:13.975 --> 01:06:18.571
- And everything else you own?
- Yes, everything.

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:24.419
- Even your knife?
- I have no knife.

01:06:26.288 --> 01:06:27.585
No knife!

01:06:34.329 --> 01:06:37.594
- You have no knife?
- No.

01:06:41.169 --> 01:06:43.729
If I give you back Torah...

01:06:44.673 --> 01:06:47.608
will you purify your
soul through fire?

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:06.454
Yes.

01:07:12.601 --> 01:07:13.863
Shit!

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:28.973
If I let you go, may I keep Torah?

01:07:32.721 --> 01:07:33.745
No!

01:08:09.758 --> 01:08:13.956
Rabbi with no knife,
you are a brave man.

01:08:16.798 --> 01:08:21.428
And you, who speak to Indians
as if to little children...

01:08:22.671 --> 01:08:26.300
your heart is big, not
as big as your mouth...

01:08:27.142 --> 01:08:28.166
<i>Well...</i>

01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:30.377
...but you have good feelings inside.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.711
Thanks, Chief, thanks very much.

01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:02.006
Thanks.

01:09:08.683 --> 01:09:12.779
You should just be healthy, and
that's the most important thing.

01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.826
Now this is a good drink.

01:09:23.798 --> 01:09:25.890
Great spirit, send us rain.

01:09:26.167 --> 01:09:30.831
Wonderful! Wonderful and nice dancing.

01:09:31.238 --> 01:09:35.038
Nice does not make rain. Yes
or no, can your God make rain?

01:09:35.343 --> 01:09:36.435
- Yes.
- But he doesn't.

01:09:36.511 --> 01:09:37.808
- That's right.
- Why?

01:09:37.879 --> 01:09:41.439
- Because that's not his department!
- But if he wanted to, he could?

01:09:41.515 --> 01:09:44.076
- Yes!
- What kind of God do you have?

01:09:44.286 --> 01:09:48.017
- Don't say, "my God." He's your God,
too!   - Don't give him to us...

01:09:48.089 --> 01:09:49.716
we have enough troubles
with our own gods.

01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:52.919
- But there's only one God.
- What does he do?

01:09:53.028 --> 01:09:56.122
He can do anything!

01:09:56.298 --> 01:09:58.630
Then why can't he make rain?

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:03.837
Because he doesn't make rain! He
gives us strength when we're suffering.

01:10:04.139 --> 01:10:07.199
He gives us compassion when
all that we feel is hatred!

01:10:07.409 --> 01:10:09.377
He gives us courage when
we're searching around...

01:10:09.444 --> 01:10:14.245
blindly like little mice in the
darkness! But he does not make rain!

01:10:24.192 --> 01:10:28.219
Of course, sometimes just like that...

01:10:28.330 --> 01:10:30.321
he'll change his mind.

01:10:52.287 --> 01:10:54.653
- This is really good fruit.
- Watch out for that stuff.

01:10:54.723 --> 01:10:57.214
What's the matter with
you? I love this fruit.

01:10:57.292 --> 01:11:01.956
- It ain't fruit! I'm telling you,
watch out.  - Eat.

01:11:04.132 --> 01:11:05.656
See that?

01:11:09.504 --> 01:11:13.964
Good! I don't know what the
recipe is, but this is good.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.642
Tell me, what do Jewish
people do to express joy?

01:11:23.718 --> 01:11:27.279
Just like the Indians,
they dance, just like this.

01:11:27.722 --> 01:11:31.453
- Show me.
- Me? Oh, I'm not a very good dancer.

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:36.492
- Do you feel joy?
- Yes, I do, very much.

01:11:36.598 --> 01:11:38.896
Then show me, please.

01:11:39.601 --> 01:11:41.159
Dance with my people.

01:11:46.041 --> 01:11:49.306
Well, I'll take a crack!

01:11:51.212 --> 01:11:52.474
No!

01:12:00.488 --> 01:12:02.422
I want him to dance with you.

01:12:02.857 --> 01:12:06.156
He is going to show you
how his people dance.

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.089
Well.

01:12:14.636 --> 01:12:16.228
Ready on the tommies?

01:12:23.111 --> 01:12:24.169
Go!

01:12:24.345 --> 01:12:28.406
Everybody dance always
with the left foot first.

01:12:29.017 --> 01:12:33.977
First we start slow. Then we're
gonna do some nice footwork.

01:12:34.956 --> 01:12:37.288
That's it. That's good with the hands.

01:12:37.358 --> 01:12:40.987
Watch that lady. I think
that lady's a Jewish Indian.

01:12:41.563 --> 01:12:46.159
Just have a little fun and don't you
worry what the neighbors are thinking.

01:12:56.811 --> 01:12:58.301
Watch the lamp post.

01:12:58.379 --> 01:13:02.179
Try to keep in time with the
other boys and girls. That's it.

01:13:02.317 --> 01:13:06.048
Just get a message from your feet.
They are talking to you all the time.

01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:09.022
I'll tell you, if you could move the
waist and the hips a little bit...

01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:14.050
you'll be very happy with the
results. Then walk toward the left...

01:13:14.162 --> 01:13:16.130
the left shoulder out.

01:13:16.664 --> 01:13:20.156
That's the way we do
it in the old country.

01:13:20.235 --> 01:13:23.966
And hold on tight. Here we go.

01:13:24.272 --> 01:13:26.263
And don't get wet.

01:13:26.341 --> 01:13:29.742
Move a little faster,
faster. Listen to the beat.

01:13:29.911 --> 01:13:34.541
Steady, hold, careful, let you
down. Get ready, let's jump.

01:13:34.783 --> 01:13:38.241
Now we do a jump, a little bitty
jump. That's the way we do it.

01:13:38.319 --> 01:13:40.480
Try a little jumping, one, two, three.

01:13:40.555 --> 01:13:44.013
And get ready for a trick. Here we go.

01:13:44.092 --> 01:13:46.458
Clap your hands, both
sides, one, two, three, four.

01:13:46.528 --> 01:13:48.655
Clap right. Clap left,
one, two, three, four.

01:13:48.763 --> 01:13:53.097
Clap right. Clap left. I think you
got it now. You got the swing of it.

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:04.142
One, two, three, four,
clap right, clap left.

01:14:06.648 --> 01:14:09.014
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

01:15:18.519 --> 01:15:19.679
Hello.

01:15:29.163 --> 01:15:31.631
Am I in the right place?

01:15:35.837 --> 01:15:37.361
I hear bells.

01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:43.134
<i>Oy vey.</i>

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.674
Am I?

01:15:50.652 --> 01:15:52.017
Is this?

01:15:56.024 --> 01:15:57.389
<i>I'm not...</i>

01:16:03.731 --> 01:16:06.791
I think I was a little sick. Wasn't I?

01:16:11.539 --> 01:16:13.530
You want to ask me anything?

01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:18.741
- He can't, cuz.
- Tommy.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.675
- How are you?
- Good.

01:16:21.749 --> 01:16:25.913
You look a lot better. Boy, you were
really out of your head last night.

01:16:26.854 --> 01:16:28.583
You had me really worried.

01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:30.716
Could you eat a little something?

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:36.454
- Always.
- Good. They're waiting breakfast for us.

01:16:37.899 --> 01:16:40.060
Leave that Torah here, it'll be safe.

01:16:40.535 --> 01:16:42.435
I've had enough
trouble with that Torah.

01:16:45.306 --> 01:16:46.898
- You're okay, huh?
- Yeah.

01:16:46.975 --> 01:16:49.068
Oh, good. Boy!

01:16:49.477 --> 01:16:52.446
Why didn't you listen to me
when I tell you about that stuff?

01:16:52.513 --> 01:16:55.038
You think I'm talking to you
for my own good, I tell you...

01:16:55.116 --> 01:16:56.845
<i>I'm not talking to you
for my own health...</i>

01:17:00.621 --> 01:17:03.556
What's the point of all my
experience, you don't listen to me.

01:17:03.624 --> 01:17:04.886
Come on, they're waiting breakfast.

01:17:05.493 --> 01:17:08.690
You mean they never
say anything, ever?

01:17:09.330 --> 01:17:13.391
See, once they take the vow,
they stop talking. I mean...

01:17:13.835 --> 01:17:16.827
not one word. There's an old
man here, Father Joseph...

01:17:16.938 --> 01:17:21.500
- he ain't spoken in 45 years.
- 45 years?

01:17:21.843 --> 01:17:23.333
<i>What... How do they...</i>

01:17:23.511 --> 01:17:27.242
What if they're playing cards and they
wanna ask their partner something...

01:17:27.315 --> 01:17:30.284
what do they do? 45 years?

01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:32.251
How can you live that long...

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:35.312
without ever asking
a person one question?

01:17:51.806 --> 01:17:52.898
Good!

01:17:54.342 --> 01:17:55.434
I like this food.

01:18:00.114 --> 01:18:02.446
I know not to ask any questions.

01:18:03.985 --> 01:18:06.510
Don't worry, I understand.

01:18:11.859 --> 01:18:13.156
Do you grow these right...

01:18:14.595 --> 01:18:16.119
Sorry, sorry.

01:18:16.931 --> 01:18:18.956
I understand, no talking.

01:18:23.938 --> 01:18:26.930
It's just that I'm not
used to this, you know?

01:18:40.455 --> 01:18:41.444
<i>Would you please...</i>

01:18:44.459 --> 01:18:45.483
The salt.

01:18:46.194 --> 01:18:48.094
Pass the salt, please!

01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:57.904
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:19:53.761 --> 01:19:55.661
You did it, didn't you?

01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:58.525
You gave them back the money.

01:19:58.633 --> 01:20:00.601
- Yup.
- Yup.

01:20:01.769 --> 01:20:03.134
Well, that ain't the American way.

01:20:03.971 --> 01:20:07.236
What's more, now you ain't got no
money. Well, now what you gonna do?

01:20:08.242 --> 01:20:09.231
Don't know.

01:20:10.144 --> 01:20:13.272
You don't know? Well, I'll
tell you what I'm gonna do...

01:20:13.347 --> 01:20:15.713
I'm gonna get me a bath,
then I'm gonna get drunk...

01:20:16.584 --> 01:20:18.848
then I'm gonna catch me a
whore with great big tits...

01:20:19.387 --> 01:20:21.048
then I'm gonna get drunk again...

01:20:21.556 --> 01:20:24.684
then I'm gonna rob that Wells
Fargo office and get my money back.

01:20:24.959 --> 01:20:26.290
You dumb-ass Jew!

01:21:46.874 --> 01:21:47.898
Evening.

01:21:51.279 --> 01:21:52.541
Evening.

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.780
We don't allow dancing in the street.

01:21:54.849 --> 01:21:56.578
You wanna dance, you go
on over to the saloon.

01:21:57.418 --> 01:21:58.976
Oh, thanks.

01:21:59.453 --> 01:22:01.114
- Evening.
- Evening.

01:22:43.497 --> 01:22:44.657
Hello.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.865
- Hope you don't mind if I watch.
- Stranger in town?

01:22:50.404 --> 01:22:54.033
- Welcome to the Red Dog.
- I like your piano playing.

01:22:58.846 --> 01:23:01.007
Ain't you got the darndest...

01:23:02.783 --> 01:23:04.546
You won again, Matt.

01:23:15.896 --> 01:23:17.454
No more bets, please.

01:23:31.278 --> 01:23:33.838
Hey, what the hell you doing, mister?

01:23:37.084 --> 01:23:39.211
Would you hold this for me, please?

01:23:39.286 --> 01:23:40.685
<i>Well, I'd...</i>

01:23:42.523 --> 01:23:43.956
All right, the wheel waits for no man.

01:23:44.024 --> 01:23:45.218
- Come on, Matt.
- Place your bets.

01:23:45.292 --> 01:23:47.726
- You're on a winning streak.
Let's go for it.  - Place your bets.

01:23:47.795 --> 01:23:50.457
Let's go. Come on.
Let it ride, all right.

01:23:51.365 --> 01:23:53.959
One, red. A winner, he wins again.

01:23:58.639 --> 01:24:00.834
I want back my money.

01:24:01.242 --> 01:24:02.834
I know you from someplace, don't I?

01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:04.377
<i>You must be loco, mister.</i>

01:24:04.912 --> 01:24:06.812
I want my $200.

01:24:08.115 --> 01:24:09.139
Piss off.

01:24:18.225 --> 01:24:19.920
All right, all right.

01:24:21.228 --> 01:24:24.664
No more bets, please. That's
good there. No more bets.

01:24:28.269 --> 01:24:30.100
I can't believe it.

01:24:31.672 --> 01:24:34.266
If he's smart, he'll leave right now.

01:24:34.375 --> 01:24:35.842
Looks like big trouble.

01:24:48.989 --> 01:24:50.581
I don't want to hurt nobody.

01:24:52.226 --> 01:24:53.625
I just want my money.

01:24:56.831 --> 01:24:58.059
We gonna kill you.

01:25:07.608 --> 01:25:09.667
That there is just
to get your attention.

01:25:11.312 --> 01:25:13.780
Better stay on the floor.
Pretend you're hurt.

01:25:37.805 --> 01:25:39.238
You ready, Mr. Jones?

01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:40.773
Oh, I'm ready.

01:25:48.249 --> 01:25:50.308
Now I remember you.

01:25:51.018 --> 01:25:53.384
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:26:09.837 --> 01:26:11.168
Put him on the bar.

01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:18.710
He's going to do the beer barrel.

01:26:18.879 --> 01:26:21.040
We haven't done that one
in a couple of months.

01:26:24.218 --> 01:26:26.709
Now, come on now, don't
mess up his funny beard.

01:26:28.489 --> 01:26:30.252
He'll break the bucko's face.

01:26:31.492 --> 01:26:32.550
Don't break the bar.

01:26:32.626 --> 01:26:34.560
I hope he's got enough
money to pay for this.

01:26:43.537 --> 01:26:45.027
Nobody move.

01:26:48.442 --> 01:26:49.431
You...

01:26:50.711 --> 01:26:52.178
put $200 on the bar.

01:26:57.484 --> 01:26:58.883
You know where the next one's going.

01:27:04.258 --> 01:27:05.316
Yes, sir.

01:27:11.231 --> 01:27:12.220
And you...

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.093
- how much you got?
- $82.

01:27:15.269 --> 01:27:16.258
Get it up there.

01:27:25.012 --> 01:27:26.479
Put the barrel down now.

01:27:37.625 --> 01:27:38.614
Now...

01:27:39.827 --> 01:27:40.816
the three of you...

01:27:42.129 --> 01:27:43.153
go away.

01:27:55.576 --> 01:27:56.565
Leave the rest.

01:27:58.412 --> 01:27:59.504
Yes, sir.

01:28:28.242 --> 01:28:29.504
You're a rich man.

01:28:30.544 --> 01:28:32.478
I got your $200 back.

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:34.838
Your friends just left.

01:28:36.784 --> 01:28:38.274
Well, in that case...

01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:43.850
let's go out and have a little fun.

01:28:47.261 --> 01:28:48.250
I'm game.

01:28:50.464 --> 01:28:52.625
Well, cuz, we made it.

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:54.628
See, it's just like I told you...

01:28:56.103 --> 01:28:57.434
right at that big tree...

01:28:58.605 --> 01:29:00.664
then left for a couple
days, sharp right...

01:29:00.741 --> 01:29:02.800
and then as straight as piss
till you come to the ocean.

01:29:03.377 --> 01:29:05.811
Who would've dreamed
it could be so simple.

01:29:07.781 --> 01:29:08.770
Yeah.

01:29:09.483 --> 01:29:10.882
If you don't know me
next time you see me...

01:29:10.951 --> 01:29:12.885
I'm gonna kick your ass
all the way back to Poland.

01:29:13.854 --> 01:29:15.321
Why wouldn't I know you?

01:29:15.856 --> 01:29:19.189
- You going away someplace?
- Well, yeah.

01:29:20.494 --> 01:29:22.121
This is where we say goodbye, Avram.

01:29:23.097 --> 01:29:24.086
What do you mean?

01:29:24.865 --> 01:29:27.959
Well, you follow that beach for a day
and a half, you'll be in San Francisco.

01:29:28.502 --> 01:29:29.833
You don't need me no more.

01:29:33.273 --> 01:29:36.174
- Where are you going?
- I'm going that way.

01:29:37.177 --> 01:29:38.166
Sutter's Mill.

01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:40.769
That's where the gold is.

01:29:45.219 --> 01:29:46.914
But I don't want you to go.

01:29:50.557 --> 01:29:53.287
- Well, I got to go.
- Why?

01:29:55.162 --> 01:29:56.652
Well, I got people to see...

01:29:58.065 --> 01:30:00.056
banks to rob, you know, I...

01:30:01.235 --> 01:30:02.259
got to make a living.

01:30:02.536 --> 01:30:04.663
Who's going to be the
best man at my wedding?

01:30:05.873 --> 01:30:09.502
Well, what do you mean? That's
for one of your Jewish friends.

01:30:10.677 --> 01:30:13.475
You got to pick your
best friend for that.

01:30:18.819 --> 01:30:19.808
<i>You...</i>

01:30:21.522 --> 01:30:23.319
You are my best friend.

01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:27.649
I'm your best friend?

01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:34.328
You're my only friend.

01:30:42.576 --> 01:30:44.669
Now listen to me, cuz...

01:30:47.214 --> 01:30:49.444
<i>you keep your eyes on this tokhes...</i>

01:30:51.218 --> 01:30:54.745
and don't you take them off
till we get to San Francisco!

01:30:57.257 --> 01:30:58.554
I never had a best friend.

01:31:22.015 --> 01:31:24.745
I got a bank robber, a bank robber...

01:31:24.818 --> 01:31:27.651
you think a bank robber
is stronger than God?

01:31:27.888 --> 01:31:32.154
I'm a rabbi! I can
beat any bank robber!

01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:34.727
Swimming lesson's over.

01:31:35.963 --> 01:31:39.296
Look at them. Mermaids out of the
ocean. Caught with their pants off.

01:31:39.766 --> 01:31:41.961
It's time for a little
comeuppance, boys!

01:31:45.873 --> 01:31:47.067
Damn you, horse!

01:31:47.441 --> 01:31:48.567
Whoa ! Whoa, now!

01:32:39.293 --> 01:32:40.419
He's out of bullets!

01:32:41.528 --> 01:32:44.691
He dropped the gun!
Get the gun! Shoot him !

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:50.063
There, right there,
look! It's in the sand!

01:32:50.404 --> 01:32:52.167
Don't let him grab the other gun!

01:32:54.741 --> 01:32:58.040
Shoot him ! He's gonna
kill us! Shoot him !

01:32:59.446 --> 01:33:00.777
Shoot him, Avram !

01:33:01.715 --> 01:33:03.273
He's going for the other gun!

01:33:04.851 --> 01:33:06.910
Shoot him for Christ's
sake! Shoot him !

01:33:08.822 --> 01:33:09.914
Help me!

01:33:11.525 --> 01:33:13.220
He's gonna kill us, shoot him !

01:33:15.662 --> 01:33:17.653
Shoot him, Avram ! Shoot him !

01:33:18.398 --> 01:33:21.526
Don't you understand! He's
going for the other gun!

01:33:21.802 --> 01:33:25.260
Don't let him grab that gun!
Don't let him grab the other gun!

01:33:26.673 --> 01:33:28.834
There, see right there!

01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:32.505
Look, it's in the sand!

01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:35.471
Shoot him, Avram ! Shoot him !

01:34:13.253 --> 01:34:16.916
It only looks bad, cuz.
I've been hurt worse before.

01:34:20.093 --> 01:34:21.185
Give me the whiskey.

01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:24.561
Get the saddle bags.

01:34:25.265 --> 01:34:28.564
I'll show you how to fix me up.

01:34:31.938 --> 01:34:32.927
All right?

01:34:40.547 --> 01:34:42.139
You never killed a man before, huh?

01:34:47.754 --> 01:34:49.187
Get me the saddlebag!

01:34:59.833 --> 01:35:00.857
Now go to sleep.

01:35:06.239 --> 01:35:07.866
You're still acting kind of funny.

01:35:08.675 --> 01:35:12.543
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine. You go to sleep now.

01:35:22.522 --> 01:35:24.581
Hey, Rabbi...

01:35:28.829 --> 01:35:30.626
you think God sent me
to show you the way?

01:35:39.639 --> 01:35:40.628
Perhaps.

01:35:43.710 --> 01:35:45.405
I must be some kind of angel.

01:36:32.893 --> 01:36:36.124
- Well, it's sure a pretty day, ain't it?
- Yes.

01:36:38.732 --> 01:36:40.290
It's a beautiful day.

01:37:40.961 --> 01:37:42.053
Howdy.

01:37:45.832 --> 01:37:46.821
Hello.

01:37:49.202 --> 01:37:50.191
Howdy.

01:37:51.738 --> 01:37:55.504
<i>Howdy. How do... Hello there.</i>

01:37:55.675 --> 01:37:56.699
Do you want something?

01:37:58.078 --> 01:38:00.706
Well, do I want?

01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:03.943
No! Well, gol dang it, ma'am,
my name is Tommy Lillard...

01:38:04.017 --> 01:38:07.748
and I come from the
Texas. I come from Texas.

01:38:10.957 --> 01:38:14.085
Excuse me, if I gave you a
little startle there. I was...

01:38:14.527 --> 01:38:16.427
a little startled there for a second.

01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:17.854
What do you want?

01:38:19.165 --> 01:38:23.659
Well, I came to bring
this thing here for...

01:38:23.737 --> 01:38:26.570
for Mr. Bender, iffing I
got the right house and all.

01:38:26.773 --> 01:38:28.172
You do, I'm his daughter.

01:38:28.241 --> 01:38:30.869
Yes, I know that. Oh,
you're the daughter?

01:38:31.011 --> 01:38:32.842
You are the Bender daughter! Oh!

01:38:34.447 --> 01:38:35.436
Howdy.

01:38:36.182 --> 01:38:37.513
Would you care to come in?

01:38:38.351 --> 01:38:43.254
Well, I would like to, but thanks,
no, because I got a friend...

01:38:43.323 --> 01:38:45.917
waiting at the saloon and...

01:38:46.259 --> 01:38:49.990
my other friend, the rabbi, asked
me to bring this here to you.

01:38:50.063 --> 01:38:52.588
- I mean, bring this to your father.
- What is it?

01:38:53.133 --> 01:38:56.330
This thing? I don't know. I
think it's some kind of Torah.

01:38:56.903 --> 01:38:57.927
A Torah?

01:38:58.538 --> 01:39:02.269
- Yeah, I think that's what he called it.
- So, where is he?

01:39:03.209 --> 01:39:04.767
- Who?
- The rabbi.

01:39:06.913 --> 01:39:10.474
Where is the rabbi? Oh,
where is the rabbi, the rabbi.

01:39:10.684 --> 01:39:12.914
Well, I don't rightly know, ma'am.

01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:17.181
The last time I seen him I was
busting my britches in the cathouse.

01:39:17.891 --> 01:39:22.453
And, my friend, the rabbi, asked me
if I should ever come Frisco way...

01:39:22.696 --> 01:39:25.392
would I drop by this house
and do him this favor.

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:30.469
Anyway, it was nice to...

01:39:30.704 --> 01:39:32.763
make your acquaintance, ma'am.

01:39:34.474 --> 01:39:35.498
<i>I'd...</i>

01:39:39.279 --> 01:39:40.337
Is something wrong?

01:39:43.283 --> 01:39:45.148
No, no.

01:39:45.251 --> 01:39:48.220
It's just I didn't know that
your eyes would be so brown.

01:39:49.889 --> 01:39:51.584
How would you know that?

01:39:54.961 --> 01:39:56.428
How would I know that?

01:39:57.063 --> 01:40:00.965
How would I know that? That's
right. How could I know that?

01:40:01.034 --> 01:40:03.798
I couldn't know that. Well...

01:40:04.938 --> 01:40:07.168
I'd better get going.

01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:09.271
I hate to keep my sidewinder waiting.

01:40:09.809 --> 01:40:13.905
So, I'll just give you
that to give to your father.

01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:16.944
Oh, wait. Papa !

01:40:17.016 --> 01:40:19.143
Oh, no, no, don't call the papa !

01:40:19.419 --> 01:40:22.286
I'd really better get my
ass out of here. So, thanks.

01:40:22.422 --> 01:40:25.016
<i>- And adios for everything.
- Wait.</i>

01:40:25.091 --> 01:40:27.252
Wait, please. Papa ! Wait!

01:40:28.661 --> 01:40:29.650
Wait!

01:40:31.297 --> 01:40:32.286
Papa?

01:40:43.877 --> 01:40:45.640
You ain't gonna eat none of this?

01:40:45.779 --> 01:40:47.212
I don't understand you, man.

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.510
If you don't eat, you're
gonna sure lose your strength.

01:40:50.116 --> 01:40:52.710
This a good piece of meat.
You ought to have something.

01:40:52.786 --> 01:40:54.276
Got to eat something. Thank you.

01:40:54.921 --> 01:40:55.945
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:40:58.958 --> 01:41:02.416
Now look, you go up and change.
And then we'll go together...

01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:06.030
and we'll tell your people that the
new rabbi has arrived. All right?

01:41:09.369 --> 01:41:12.065
I told you that I can't be a rabbi.

01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:16.270
Don't you tell me that!
Just don't say that again!

01:41:16.409 --> 01:41:19.071
Not after what I've been through
to get your goddamn ass here alive!

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.573
If you hadn't shot that
man, we'd both be dead!

01:41:22.749 --> 01:41:24.546
Do you understand that,
you ignorant asshole?

01:41:27.086 --> 01:41:28.314
You do understand that?

01:41:29.022 --> 01:41:31.354
He was gonna kill you, then he
was gonna kill me. Am I right?

01:41:32.325 --> 01:41:34.725
When you shot that son of
a bitch, that was not a sin!

01:41:37.664 --> 01:41:39.256
Then what the hell
are we talking about?

01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:44.927
When those men were shooting at you...

01:41:46.639 --> 01:41:48.607
I ran to save the Torah.

01:41:49.008 --> 01:41:50.999
So? I understand that.

01:41:51.211 --> 01:41:55.079
- You're a man of God. I understand that.
- I wasn't thinking about God.

01:41:56.716 --> 01:42:01.619
I didn't do it because of God.
I don't know one thing about God.

01:42:04.691 --> 01:42:06.420
I was thinking about a book.

01:42:07.927 --> 01:42:10.896
I cared more for a book than
I did for my best friend.

01:42:12.999 --> 01:42:15.661
I don't know if you
can understand that.

01:42:15.735 --> 01:42:19.227
I don't want to insult you, but
do you understand what I mean?

01:42:21.207 --> 01:42:25.701
I chose a piece of
paper, instead of you.

01:42:27.714 --> 01:42:29.113
But I forgive you.

01:42:32.452 --> 01:42:34.113
I know that you do.

01:42:35.121 --> 01:42:36.816
But you're a good man.

01:42:36.890 --> 01:42:40.883
I am a good man. I am.
But I'm not a rabbi.

01:42:41.361 --> 01:42:42.555
You don't say that!

01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:46.121
- Tommy, I'm not a rabbi.
- Don't say that!

01:42:52.205 --> 01:42:54.400
You are a rabbi.

01:42:54.841 --> 01:42:58.834
I'm a bank robber. I'm a card
player and a whore-monger.

01:42:58.912 --> 01:43:00.106
That's what I am.

01:43:00.313 --> 01:43:01.712
You are a rabbi.

01:43:02.749 --> 01:43:05.149
You can fall in the mud,
you can slip on your ass...

01:43:05.218 --> 01:43:06.879
you can travel in the wrong direction.

01:43:07.253 --> 01:43:09.414
But even on your ass,
even in the mud...

01:43:09.489 --> 01:43:13.653
even if you go in the wrong direction
for a little while, you're still a rabbi!

01:43:14.227 --> 01:43:15.751
That's what you are!

01:43:16.362 --> 01:43:17.351
Right?

01:43:20.166 --> 01:43:22.327
If I'm who I am, how come
you ain't what you are?

01:43:23.636 --> 01:43:25.797
You're just too goddamn
good to have the same rules.

01:43:27.273 --> 01:43:28.433
Now you answer me.

01:43:29.008 --> 01:43:30.669
You look me in the
eye and you answer me.

01:43:32.245 --> 01:43:34.110
Don't you dare sit
there and not answer me!

01:43:35.381 --> 01:43:36.973
You'd better have an answer for me!

01:43:47.961 --> 01:43:49.451
Is this the place?

01:43:49.696 --> 01:43:51.721
<i>This doesn't look like
a place that a rabbi...</i>

01:43:52.632 --> 01:43:54.862
Maybe Rosalie made a mistake.

01:43:55.568 --> 01:43:57.433
We don't belong in
here. Come, Benjamin.

01:44:03.343 --> 01:44:05.277
Look at those funny-looking people.

01:44:05.612 --> 01:44:07.512
Those dresses look like
they came from Europe.

01:44:23.563 --> 01:44:26.259
What's he talkin' about?
What's he talkin' about?

01:44:26.399 --> 01:44:28.560
He wants to know if you're the rabbi.

01:44:29.836 --> 01:44:30.860
Me?

01:44:36.309 --> 01:44:37.606
You tell 'em.

01:44:43.716 --> 01:44:44.944
I'm the rabbi.

01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:49.080
You're the rabbi?

01:44:51.791 --> 01:44:53.588
Funny, you don't look like a rabbi.

01:44:59.165 --> 01:45:02.362
I just traveled 3,000
miles across this country...

01:45:03.069 --> 01:45:06.664
and I was thanking my best
friend for getting me here alive!

01:45:08.141 --> 01:45:10.200
My name is Avram Belinski...

01:45:10.943 --> 01:45:13.138
and I come from a small
village in Poland...

01:45:13.546 --> 01:45:15.946
and don't you judge
people by their appearance!

01:45:17.650 --> 01:45:20.585
- We have a rabbi!
- We have a rabbi!

01:45:25.658 --> 01:45:28.320
Excuse me, Rabbi, please forgive me.

01:45:28.728 --> 01:45:31.253
I am very, very happy to see you.

01:45:31.964 --> 01:45:35.331
- Let's have a drink, for God's sake.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

01:45:35.535 --> 01:45:36.524
Wait a minute!

01:45:36.803 --> 01:45:37.895
Who's paying?

01:45:38.037 --> 01:45:41.438
Take from the building
fund. Everybody to the bar!

01:45:47.447 --> 01:45:51.281
Pardon me, everybody, please,
please make a little room here.

01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:53.648
<i>Thank you. I'm so
sorry to spoil your...</i>

01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:56.985
Bartender, drinks for all my friends.

01:45:57.056 --> 01:45:59.456
- Well, what'll you have?
- Straight whiskey!

01:45:59.559 --> 01:46:01.390
Whiskey for everybody!

01:46:12.271 --> 01:46:15.069
Rabbi, this is Mrs. Bender.

01:46:17.243 --> 01:46:20.041
Welcome. Welcome, Rabbi.

01:46:20.246 --> 01:46:23.613
And, this is my younger
daughter, Rosalie.

01:46:24.751 --> 01:46:27.413
I know that in our
marriage agreement...

01:46:27.487 --> 01:46:30.081
I mentioned my other
daughter, Sarah Mindl.

01:46:30.156 --> 01:46:33.250
- But what difference does it make...
- Papa !

01:46:49.175 --> 01:46:51.268
You know, your father thinks that...

01:46:51.344 --> 01:46:54.404
you can just switch one promised-wife
for another promised-wife...

01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:57.208
but I know that it isn't
that way in America.

01:46:58.651 --> 01:47:01.848
So, please don't feel...

01:47:02.021 --> 01:47:03.818
obligated in that way.

01:47:09.228 --> 01:47:11.219
Wouldn't you like to dance with me?

01:47:13.599 --> 01:47:17.000
I would. I would love
to dance with you.

01:47:17.737 --> 01:47:21.969
But, you know, a rabbi
shouldn't do that.

01:47:24.844 --> 01:47:27.540
A rabbi can dance with
his fiancée, can't he?

01:48:23.469 --> 01:48:24.493
Bartender!

01:48:25.171 --> 01:48:26.160
Yes.

01:48:26.873 --> 01:48:27.862
You get out here!

01:48:30.910 --> 01:48:31.899
Yes.

01:48:32.879 --> 01:48:34.176
Now, you listen good!

01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:42.110
That man killed my brother.

01:48:44.724 --> 01:48:46.487
Me and him gonna have a fair fight.

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.785
There ain't gonna be
no advantage taken here.

01:48:51.230 --> 01:48:52.527
We're going outside.

01:48:53.666 --> 01:48:55.793
Bartender, I just want
it down for the record...

01:48:57.536 --> 01:48:58.935
this gonna be a fair fight.

01:49:01.107 --> 01:49:02.096
Rabbi.

01:49:04.076 --> 01:49:05.065
Rabbi, let's go.

01:49:06.279 --> 01:49:07.303
No more killing.

01:49:10.049 --> 01:49:11.073
Oh, yes.

01:49:13.052 --> 01:49:14.349
Oh, yes.

01:49:16.222 --> 01:49:19.282
Please, don't do this.

01:49:23.562 --> 01:49:27.293
It'd be terrible if some innocent
people in here got hurt, wouldn't it?

01:49:34.507 --> 01:49:35.565
Huh, Rabbi?

01:49:37.944 --> 01:49:39.571
Is what he says true?

01:49:41.847 --> 01:49:42.939
Is it?

01:49:47.019 --> 01:49:48.850
All right, get outside, both of you.

01:50:13.746 --> 01:50:15.213
Go somewhere else.

01:50:18.851 --> 01:50:20.045
Rabbi...

01:50:20.553 --> 01:50:21.884
you got a gun?

01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:43.108
Well, there you go.

01:50:46.345 --> 01:50:48.176
Well, don't worry.

01:50:49.248 --> 01:50:50.943
You know this gun.

01:50:51.917 --> 01:50:54.886
This is the one you used to
kill my brother Darryl with.

01:50:56.455 --> 01:50:59.288
There gonna be no
advantage taken here.

01:51:09.869 --> 01:51:11.268
There.

01:51:12.471 --> 01:51:13.870
Just like a man.

01:51:37.997 --> 01:51:39.294
Make your move!

01:51:43.135 --> 01:51:45.330
Well, don't just stare at me!

01:51:46.072 --> 01:51:48.131
You ain't gonna get
away with it like that!

01:51:50.009 --> 01:51:52.273
Draw, you stinking coward!

01:52:09.528 --> 01:52:12.554
You yellow bastard! Draw!

01:52:13.933 --> 01:52:16.663
You draw or I'm gonna
bash your head in!

01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.254
That was just to get your attention!

01:52:40.793 --> 01:52:42.226
Now listen to me!

01:52:43.062 --> 01:52:44.620
The war is over!

01:52:47.333 --> 01:52:48.891
You understand that?

01:52:50.769 --> 01:52:52.202
No more killing!

01:53:07.753 --> 01:53:10.620
You reach for that pistol again
and I'll blow your head off!

01:53:11.757 --> 01:53:13.315
This ain't your fight!

01:53:13.826 --> 01:53:15.418
This is my fight!

01:53:16.128 --> 01:53:18.596
But he killed my brother,
and I'm gonna kill him !

01:53:19.398 --> 01:53:21.866
You and your partner and
your pig-faced brother...

01:53:21.934 --> 01:53:23.731
ambushed us on the beach...

01:53:23.903 --> 01:53:26.337
and if the rabbi hadn't
pulled the trigger...

01:53:26.505 --> 01:53:28.564
you'd have shot us both in cold blood!

01:53:38.217 --> 01:53:40.708
Reach for it! Please!

01:53:45.891 --> 01:53:47.256
Wait a second.

01:53:48.394 --> 01:53:49.861
Now wait a second.

01:53:51.664 --> 01:53:52.961
Let's talk this over.

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:56.225
I'm not a rabbi for nothing, you know.

01:53:57.269 --> 01:53:58.668
I think I have a solution.

01:53:59.638 --> 01:54:00.832
Just wait a second.

01:54:15.921 --> 01:54:18.082
This is a very big country.

01:54:19.191 --> 01:54:22.024
I'll tell you what I
think is the best thing.

01:54:24.063 --> 01:54:25.826
I'll take San Francisco...

01:54:26.599 --> 01:54:28.260
you take the rest of America...

01:54:30.202 --> 01:54:32.932
and if you ever come back
to this place again...

01:54:34.106 --> 01:54:36.802
I don't think you're
gonna get off so easy.

01:54:43.649 --> 01:54:45.412
Now get the hell outta here.

01:55:02.067 --> 01:55:06.800
Would somebody please show this
poor asshole the way out of town?

01:55:20.119 --> 01:55:21.586
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

01:55:26.592 --> 01:55:30.619
<i>I've crossed rivers and I've
climbed high mountains...</i>

01:55:30.829 --> 01:55:33.263
<i>and I was captured
by wonderful Indians.</i>

01:55:33.999 --> 01:55:35.933
<i>I did so many things.</i>

01:55:36.068 --> 01:55:38.400
<i>God has truly blessed me.</i>

01:55:40.072 --> 01:55:41.801
<i>And what's more...</i>

01:55:41.974 --> 01:55:46.104
<i>how many rabbis can say that they
had a bank robber for a best man?</i>

01:55:47.813 --> 01:55:49.713
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

01:55:50.215 --> 01:55:52.206
Music, Maestro, please!

01:58:40.853 --> 01:58:41.842
