HARROW: Didn't you just
sign your divorce papers?

00:04.000 --> 00:06.480
He is a really nice guy.
So what was missing?

00:06.480 --> 00:08.920
You were lucky to find a solicitor
this late in the day.

00:08.920 --> 00:11.320
Sage is my fiancee.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.360
Tanya. We really worked.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.320
Where's your mother?
She's dead.

00:15.320 --> 00:19.040
Did James tell you he stole
$22 million from my company?

00:19.040 --> 00:21.400
LUND: He'll never give up his boy.
He might.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.840
If he has to choose between James
and his daughter.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.960
She's playing you.
It wasn't me who stole her money.

00:25.960 --> 00:26.960
It was Max.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.360
I think Harrow's son was involved
in Max Zoric's death.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.560
I want to tap Daniel Harrow's phone.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.920
FERN: You knew I was going to Mum's.
Nichols was there waiting for me.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.520
Well, I needed
to get my phone back...

00:36.520 --> 00:38.160
You used me again!

00:38.160 --> 00:40.840
Can I just see that it's here?
Sorry. It's been shipped out.

03:19.720 --> 03:23.480
So, uh...what seems
to be the problem?

03:25.520 --> 03:28.920
This. Been doing it for the past
couple of days now.

03:32.240 --> 03:36.880

take me some time.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.640

03:38.640 --> 03:40.280
I'll be gone most of the day.

03:45.320 --> 03:49.280
Oh. Yeah, um, just need you to take
something back to the evidence room.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.880

send emails at the moment.

Yeah, we might have another lead
on Harrow's son.

Can I get into my email?

04:24.400 --> 04:26.320
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, great.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.880
We're waiting on an email from them,

04:27.880 --> 04:29.960
so hopefully they'll have
a passport photo.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.760
Yeah. Well, that'd be helpful.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.640
Anything there from Immigration?

04:33.640 --> 04:36.640
Uh...don't think so.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.880
How could she have a heart attack?
She was 28!

06:47.880 --> 06:50.280
Well, was there any history
of heart problems in her family?

06:50.280 --> 06:53.560
No. No, both her parents are alive.
Her grandparents are alive.

06:53.560 --> 06:57.480

07:09.480 --> 07:11.240
Well, I can't! I'm still at work...

07:11.240 --> 07:13.080
..I am going to do everything I can

07:13.080 --> 07:15.720
to find out exactly what happened
to your wife

07:15.720 --> 07:19.320
but...it is going to take some hours.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.840
Thank you.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.680
We've been together
since we were at school.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.320
She has injuries
to her mouth and nose

07:55.320 --> 07:57.720
but they could be from the collision.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.640
Do we have any photos
from the vehicle?

07:59.640 --> 08:01.600
Uh, there's no damage
to the vehicle.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.800
Police at the scene think it was
barely moving when it hit the bins.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.800
This blood is an odd colour.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.280
Can you take a sample?
Sure thing.

08:19.880 --> 08:23.160
More cuts and bruising
to the inside of her lips.

08:23.160 --> 08:26.960
Her tongue and throat are swollen
and...

08:26.960 --> 08:28.640
What's this?

08:36.480 --> 08:38.800
Eww! What is that?

08:38.800 --> 08:40.800
Some sort of...

08:40.800 --> 08:42.400
..fruit.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.240
Pass me the endocam.

08:58.960 --> 09:03.200
Her larynx is swollen,
almost completely closed.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.320
Well, she'd barely get any air into
her lungs through that opening.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.640
There's so much mucus!

09:22.080 --> 09:23.880
A raspberry?

09:25.680 --> 09:27.560
More than one.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.640
Not even chewed - swallowed whole,

09:30.640 --> 09:34.160
which means that's not just blood -
that's raspberry juice.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.120
So she choked on them.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.360
If she had, there'd be no mucus,

09:38.360 --> 09:42.160
and the raspberries aren't
large enough to block the airway.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.680
It looks more like...

09:43.680 --> 09:45.120
Anaphylaxis?

09:46.120 --> 09:47.760
Yes.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.440
Looks like she was
allergic to raspberries.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.480
But...Gabriella loved raspberries.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.160
She would eat them all the time
if we could afford them.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.720
(SIGHS) Had she ever
had a reaction before?

10:04.720 --> 10:06.720
Even a mild one?

10:08.920 --> 10:10.480
So, uh...

10:10.480 --> 10:12.760
..where would she get them from?

10:15.240 --> 10:18.160
GRACE: This is where she worked?
As a maid, yes.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.200
And do you think she got
the raspberries here?

10:20.200 --> 10:21.680
Maybe.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.440
Thanks, mate.
Thank you.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.920
But won't tox tell us

10:26.920 --> 10:28.800
if there's something wrong
with the raspberries?

10:28.800 --> 10:31.400
Yes but not fast enough to stop it
happening to someone else.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.840
Ooh, I feel like
I'm on my honeymoon.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.840
I never had one.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.120
Huh?

10:39.120 --> 10:43.440
Well, we went to Fiji but there was
a storm and we got rained in,

10:43.440 --> 10:45.840
then the chef died
in unusual circumstances.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.000
You did an autopsy
on your honeymoon?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.080
(LAUGHS) Tell me again
why you're single?

10:51.080 --> 10:54.080
Good afternoon. May we speak
with your duty manager?

10:54.080 --> 10:55.840
Yes. He's right here.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.520
How can I help?

10:57.520 --> 10:59.080
We're with the Coroner.

10:59.080 --> 11:02.280
We'd like to ask you a few questions
about Gabriella Echeverria.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.760
Not here. Please.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.160
Kitchen is this way.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.760
I don't even know why she left
when she did.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.440
She didn't clock off,
didn't fill out her timesheet.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.400
Should you two still be here?

11:36.400 --> 11:39.440
I've spoken to both of you
about this in the past.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.320
I expect all employees to strictly
adhere to rosters and break times.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.280
Back to work.
Hard worker?

11:45.320 --> 11:48.120
Very. She took as many shifts
as I could give her.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.280
Ah, Fiona!

11:51.280 --> 11:54.160
You're friends with Gabriella.
Uh, yes.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.720
Is very sad.
Did you see her last night?

11:56.720 --> 11:59.320
Uh, we had different shifts.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.720
I need to talk to you
before you leave today.

12:03.720 --> 12:07.160
You know why.
Y-yes, Mr Moore.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.880
Come and see me when you've
finished your shift, please.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.720
OK. Off you go.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.800
They're $80 a kilo,
flown in from Tasmania.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.040
80?

12:28.040 --> 12:30.280
They think there might be
something wrong with them.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.920
There can't be.
They're the best available.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.360
Ha...

12:35.960 --> 12:38.200
They're too expensive
to use in desserts.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.960
Only in the fruit platters.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.080
Fruit platters?
Welcome packs.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.720
Emilio. They only go to our
VIP guests on level 15.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.160
Organic, hand-picked.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.760
How many did you do yesterday?
Uh, only one.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.000
Room 1503.
Amanda!

12:53.160 --> 12:54.760
Sorry.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.600
As you can see, there's nothing
wrong with our raspberries.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.040
And Gabriella didn't
have access to them anyway.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.000
Room staff aren't allowed
in the kitchen.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.200
Then she must have come into contact
up on level 15.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.920
She couldn't have.
She only worked the non-VIP levels.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.200
Maybe she went up there
to visit another maid.

13:10.200 --> 13:14.720
The VIP floor has top security.
Even the maids need card access.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.160
Look, we need to trace
Gabriella's movements.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.360
Somehow, she must have been
in room 1503.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.880
I noticed your security room -

13:22.880 --> 13:25.040
perhaps if we could
look at the footage...

13:25.040 --> 13:26.600
Absolutely not.
But...

13:26.600 --> 13:28.160
Have you any idea where you are?

13:28.160 --> 13:30.040
Our guests pay a premium
for privacy.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.040
There's no way
I'm gonna violate that,

13:32.040 --> 13:33.960
not without a warrant.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.560
Now, please.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.920
Can you tell me what happens
to the leftover fruit platters?

13:46.640 --> 13:48.120
Aha!

13:50.400 --> 13:53.480
A receipt from room 1509,

13:53.480 --> 13:55.760
champagne and abalone.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.560
You have lemon peel in your hair.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.120
That must be from
this Moroccan tagine,

14:02.120 --> 14:04.840
ordered by room 1506.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.520
Any raspberries?

14:07.520 --> 14:09.000
No.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.360
See, and that doesn't make sense.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.960
This all came from the VIP floor
yesterday.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.440
So, where's the fruit platter?

14:19.320 --> 14:22.920
So, there was only one fruit platter.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.040
It should be here but it isn't.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.160
Gabriella couldn't have
taken it home,

14:27.160 --> 14:28.840
otherwise it would be in her car.

14:28.840 --> 14:32.680
She had a reaction like anaphylaxis
to the raspberries

14:32.680 --> 14:34.600
but her husband said
she wasn't allergic.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.080
I think we need to go
to the 15th floor.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.560
Oh, why?

14:39.560 --> 14:41.480
Because that's where
the raspberries were!

14:41.480 --> 14:43.160
Daniel, it doesn't matter!

14:47.840 --> 14:50.000

an unfortunate reaction.

It's been fun, but we need
to get back to work.

Yelena Grishenko.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.520
That actually sounds familiar.

19:36.520 --> 19:40.600
She's a Russian journalist
and an environmental activist.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.760
Oh, yeah. Anti-pollution.

with raspberries.

She's had attempts on her life

20:12.800 --> 20:15.400
but no-one can prove who.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.040
The fossil fuel industries
want to shut her up.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.640
So does her own government.

must have been poisoned

Yes, as well as books and artefacts.

I wanted to have Pythagoras stuffed
when he died.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.840
Mum wouldn't let me.
Who's Pythagoras?

22:21.840 --> 22:24.160
My guinea pig.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.680
You named your guinea pig Pythagoras?

22:26.680 --> 22:29.960
Mum named it Pythagoras
but it was a good idea.

22:29.960 --> 22:33.160
The real Pythagoras
wasn't just a mathematician.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.360
He had a lot of
useful life advice too.

22:36.720 --> 22:39.560

with swallows."

afraid to help him.

you should just leave him alone.

from that.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.200
"Skol 'ko stoit pivo?"

26:48.200 --> 26:50.440
and, "U menya gemorroy."

26:50.440 --> 26:52.000
Which mean...?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.480
"How much is that beer?"

26:53.480 --> 26:54.960
And, "I have haemorrhoids."

26:57.120 --> 27:00.160
Regardless, I know THAT is Russian.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.800
Anything else unusual?

27:01.800 --> 27:04.360
Only his hand. Have a look.

27:04.360 --> 27:07.360
SOCOs couldn't be sure but they
thought it might have been a...

27:07.360 --> 27:09.000
A bite.

27:10.440 --> 27:15.720
The bruising on his neck matches the
internal bruising around the larynx.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.320
Harrow, what are you doing here?

27:18.320 --> 27:19.840
Uncle Lyle.
Hmm?

27:19.840 --> 27:21.960
Have you seen this?
Mucus.

27:21.960 --> 27:24.280
Which is not consistent
with strangulation.

27:24.280 --> 27:26.760
That's two cases in two.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.320
I agree it's unusual.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.320
Daniel, I think
we have an issue here.

27:30.320 --> 27:33.000
What? Why are you talking to him?
He's not even supposed to be here!

27:33.000 --> 27:34.240
I do too.

27:34.240 --> 27:35.760
The only issue we have

27:35.760 --> 27:37.680
is the amount of pathologists
I have to wade through

27:37.680 --> 27:39.160
to conduct my autopsy.

27:39.160 --> 27:41.560
What is that?
Gabriella's teeth.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.440
The maid? What on earth has she...?

27:43.440 --> 27:46.400
I think they'll match that bite mark.

27:50.240 --> 27:53.760
Oh, goodness. Bite matching
has been rigorously discredited.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.840
Unless you have a very particular
pattern, which that is not.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.920
What if Gabriella didn't
eat the raspberries?

27:59.920 --> 28:01.400
Remember they weren't chewed.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.080
What, they were forced
into her mouth?

28:03.080 --> 28:05.360
And she bit the man who did it!

28:05.360 --> 28:07.720
See? That's why we couldn't
find the fruit platter!

28:07.720 --> 28:10.000
This guy took it!
Excuse me?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.160
So, Russian secret service
are trying to kill Yelena?

28:12.160 --> 28:14.000
And somehow, Gabriella
got between them.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.520
Hello!
So, who killed this man and why?

28:16.520 --> 28:20.480
I don't know but I think
Yelena is in serious danger.

28:20.480 --> 28:23.200
This isn't even your autopsy!
No. You're right.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.840
It's yours.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.520
Sorry, Uncle Lyle.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.040
I have to save the planet.

28:33.280 --> 28:37.760
Edwina, I need you to run
another series of tox screenings.

28:37.760 --> 28:41.320
EDWINA: On Gabriella?
And the man who was garrotted.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.800
What are you looking for?
Some sort of toxin.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.600
And look for plasma cholinesterase
activity.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.880
I'm expecting to find it reduced.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.160
I thought tox was clear for poison.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.680
Yes, it was.

28:52.680 --> 28:55.160
I think they were killed
with some sort of nerve agent.

28:55.160 --> 28:56.880
Can we fast-track that, please?

28:58.200 --> 28:59.400
Hmm.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.560
We need to talk with Yelena
Grishenko, urgently.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.320
There's no guest here by that name.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.800
Look, I know she's here.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.480
Not in room 1503 -

29:07.480 --> 29:10.680
that's just the room she hires
to ward off would-be assassins.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.400
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.360
It's here. Her talk -
this is where she's giving it.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.240
We need to get in.

29:23.240 --> 29:25.360
Do you have a ticket?
No.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.120
Well, then...
Look.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.720
I can talk to her

29:28.720 --> 29:33.520
or I can call the Feds and get
this entire hotel shut down.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.800
Do you have proof?

29:43.800 --> 29:45.240
It's coming.

29:45.240 --> 29:48.040
Do you have a face?
Not yet.

29:48.040 --> 29:51.080
These people, they, um,
poisoned the raspberries?

29:51.080 --> 29:53.720
Not poison. Nerve agent.

29:54.720 --> 29:57.080
Then I won't eat any raspberries.

29:57.080 --> 30:00.560
Ms Grishenko, please.
You can't go on stage.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.400
Show me a face.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.360

Now.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.080
That maid you were telling off
yesterday.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.320
She snuck off early, didn't she?

30:13.320 --> 30:15.160
To go to the doctor's.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.560
I need to talk to you
before you leave.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.520
She had bloods taken.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.120
I wouldn't have a clue.

30:23.120 --> 30:26.440
And she got Gabriella
to cover for her on the VIP floor.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.760
We need to see
who came into this room.

30:33.760 --> 30:37.400
Why? As you said, Ms Grishenko
wasn't actually staying here.

30:37.400 --> 30:41.240
I know. But her attackers
may not have figured that out.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.880
That's her.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.000
Can you, uh, fast-forward
to room 1503?

30:54.360 --> 30:56.280
OK. Play from there.

30:59.080 --> 31:01.120
Why did she come out so fast?

31:03.520 --> 31:05.720
There. Stop it there.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.320
They're not staff.
They're wearing gloves.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.000
Can you, uh, zoom in?

31:17.360 --> 31:20.080
That's the man who was garrotted.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.760
And the other guy?

31:24.520 --> 31:26.160
Still out there.

31:31.080 --> 31:34.280
Russian agents?
I know it sounds crazy.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.480
That's why I need you
to tell the Feds.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.960
They'll think I'm a crackpot.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.760
No! Really?

31:40.920 --> 31:43.280
Grace is sending you
a photo of the suspect now.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.120
The Feds might know this guy.

(MESSAGE ALERT BLEEPS)

31:49.800 --> 31:51.720
OK. Where are you two now?

31:51.720 --> 31:55.120
In the lobby of the hotel.
The guy's gotta be here somewhere.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.680
OK, Harrow. Stay away from the guy
and wait for back-up.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.560
He's not gonna give up
until he gets Yelena.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.800
Excuse me. Excuse me.

32:12.440 --> 32:13.920
Sorry.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.800
Sorry. Sorry.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.920
Where did he go?
There.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.320
Right. Tell Yelena.
Tell her security.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.160
Don't let her go on stage.
Where are you going?

32:25.160 --> 32:26.680
After him!

32:26.680 --> 32:27.960
Sorry.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.880
Hey! Stop!

Gabriella bit your friend.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.000
Aargh!

33:55.000 --> 33:57.080
So he got affected too.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.000
So what happened?

34:00.000 --> 34:01.800
He wanted to go to hospital.

34:02.880 --> 34:05.000
But you couldn't let that happen.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.720

This is it.

from going on stage!

I can't.

I didn't.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.320
You bailed us out?

Well, Sage did the paperwork.
It was all very straightforward.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.520
how the investigation into
the death of Max Zoric was going.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.240
I said I didn't know any more,

40:22.240 --> 40:25.800
except that Samuel Bramson
finished his second autopsy

40:25.800 --> 40:29.080
and...suggested foul play.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.560
Merilee could have called me.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.960
She knows you're close to the case.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.280
What - because Harrow's son
might be involved?

40:40.400 --> 40:42.200
Does she want me
removed from the case?

40:42.200 --> 40:44.760
I don't think so. Nor would I.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.360
But she is getting pressure.

40:47.520 --> 40:50.920
What kind?
Mila Zoric is no fool, Bryan.

40:50.920 --> 40:53.680
She's made a lot of money.
She's got a lot of friends.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.280
Merilee says her office
is getting three calls a day

40:56.280 --> 40:58.600
from the Zoric legal team,
asking for things.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.520
What things?

41:00.520 --> 41:04.640
Like the release
of Max Zoric's remains.

41:04.640 --> 41:09.560
And the vehicle found at the shipyard
and the items in it.

41:09.560 --> 41:10.760
Right.

41:10.760 --> 41:14.440
Well, uh, if both Dr Fairley and
Dr Bramson have conducted their PMs,

41:14.440 --> 41:17.200
I don't see any reason to keep
a mother from burying her son.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.720
I agree.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.560
As for the things
we found in the car,

41:20.560 --> 41:22.240
I can't release them.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.920
The phone.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.520
You think it's material evidence.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.320
Well, I can't prove it yet
but I think

41:28.320 --> 41:31.160
it somehow connects James Reed
to the death of Max Zoric.

41:31.160 --> 41:32.800
So I'm not letting it go.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.880
What about James Reed's father?

41:37.440 --> 41:40.680
Yeah, well, if Harrow knows
anything, he'd be wise to share it.

41:40.680 --> 41:42.520
Before a trial.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.360
Who's claiming him?

41:54.360 --> 41:56.480
Well, the Feds, for now.

And after that, a bureaucratic paper
cluster that would choke a goat.

42:01.080 --> 42:04.400
I only wish I'd managed
to stop the second Russian.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.560
Well, don't worry about that.
Someone did.

42:07.560 --> 42:10.000

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000

42:43.640 --> 42:45.200
And both of these men...

42:46.360 --> 42:48.000
..they are dead?

42:51.680 --> 42:54.000
She fought her attackers very hard.

42:58.440 --> 43:00.080
But she's still gone.

43:02.440 --> 43:04.360
Nothing makes it hurt less.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.000
I know.

43:29.120 --> 43:31.200
That should do it.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.280
Uh, so, what was wrong with it?

43:33.280 --> 43:35.520
Uh, some sort of malware. Um...

43:37.560 --> 43:40.320
Did anyone else have access
to your computer?

43:40.320 --> 43:43.160
Uh, no. No.
Well, except the other techie.

43:43.160 --> 43:44.880

the other day.

and I just got it.

Uh, before you go...

43:55.480 --> 43:58.240
..can you check
if any emails were deleted?

43:58.240 --> 44:00.440
Sure. You mean in trash?

44:01.560 --> 44:03.640
No, no - just if, uh...

44:03.640 --> 44:05.240
..if someone was here

44:05.240 --> 44:08.280
and they wanted to
delete something permanently.

I'm not my father.
No.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.840
You're not.

46:32.840 --> 46:35.480
Harrow's a better man
than you'll ever be.

46:42.360 --> 46:44.360
Enjoy your meal.

46:55.760 --> 47:00.080
NICHOLS: Do you think this guy,
who we now know is James Reed...

47:01.720 --> 47:03.480
..could be him?

47:03.480 --> 47:05.360
Yeah, maybe.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.440
What was he after in the car?

47:08.480 --> 47:10.600
Same thing he was after
in my office.

47:10.600 --> 47:12.920
The phone Cybercrimes can't unlock.

47:12.920 --> 47:15.360
Yep.
Why do you think he wants it?

47:15.360 --> 47:20.040
Well, it's got something to do
with the death of Max Zoric.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.880
Hey.
Hi.

47:38.880 --> 47:40.520
What would you like?

47:40.520 --> 47:42.000
I don't know, James -

47:42.000 --> 47:44.760
something with 22 million
answers in it?

47:53.080 --> 47:55.080
('HEY MOON' BY JOHN MAUS PLAYS)

47:55.080 --> 47:58.400
# It's just you and me tonight

47:59.640 --> 48:02.360
# Everyone else is asleep

48:03.440 --> 48:05.360
# Hey, moon

48:05.360 --> 48:08.160
# If I was to fall

48:14.720 --> 48:18.480
# I know it's been so long

48:18.480 --> 48:21.360
# Since we saw each other last

48:26.440 --> 48:30.560
# I'm sure we'll find some way

48:30.560 --> 48:35.480
# To make the time pass... #

(PHONE RINGS)

48:53.160 --> 48:54.880
Daniel.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.640
Where are you?

48:57.640 --> 48:59.360
The lab.

48:59.360 --> 49:01.680
Penance.
(CHUCKLES)

49:02.680 --> 49:04.360
Is everything OK?

49:05.720 --> 49:07.480
Ice-cream.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.080
What?

49:10.080 --> 49:11.800
You suggested ice-cream.

49:11.800 --> 49:13.400
Let's get some.

49:13.400 --> 49:15.120
What, now?

49:15.120 --> 49:17.160
I think there's only now.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.400
Yeah.

49:21.400 --> 49:24.800
So, what do you say?
That place down by the water?

49:26.720 --> 49:28.240
Sure.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.040
Half an hour?

49:30.040 --> 49:31.560
See you there.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.760
(SIGHS)

49:55.480 --> 49:56.960
Hello, Daniel.

49:59.280 --> 50:01.040
Tanya?

50:04.640 --> 50:06.280
Next, on Harrow...

50:06.280 --> 50:07.960
Is James in trouble?

50:07.960 --> 50:11.520
I'm not sure he wasn't involved
in that boy's death.

50:11.520 --> 50:13.080
JAMES: I didn't steal a cent.

50:13.080 --> 50:16.080
FERN: If she thought you did,
what would she do to you?

50:16.080 --> 50:17.800
I think she'd kill me.

50:17.800 --> 50:20.240
NICHOLS: Jesus. Is that...?
MAN: Tanya Reed.

50:20.240 --> 50:22.000
Let's see where they take us.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.160
FAIRLEY: Pistols at dawn, eh?

50:24.160 --> 50:26.240
HARROW: Do you know
what the duel was over?

50:26.240 --> 50:28.040
There's nothing to find here.

50:29.760 --> 50:31.560
Sounds like I'm the only loose end.
