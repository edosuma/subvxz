WEBVTT

00:15.975 --> 00:18.561
Okay. Let's see where we are.

00:19.103 --> 00:22.815
We could move this, get rid of that, kill that.

00:23.065 --> 00:27.486
That kind of freaks me out. Don't need her.
We can get rid of that.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.989
That's done. Okay, we could start with this.

00:30.156 --> 00:33.200
I know it's a hard-hitting piece,
but come on, you guys, it's the Internet.

00:33.284 --> 00:35.578
We need traffic, traffic, traffic.
What do you got?

00:35.745 --> 00:38.289
– How about this?
– It's perfect.

00:38.414 --> 00:40.791
Now, doesn't she look smart and
knowledgeable about immigration reform?

00:40.958 --> 00:42.793
– Yeah.
– Yeah, yeah. She does, right?

00:42.919 --> 00:45.212
I'm fucking with you people.
This isn't a porn site.

00:45.296 --> 00:46.964
What are we, nerds trying to look at boobies?

00:47.590 --> 00:48.841
Come on, keep looking.

00:49.592 --> 00:51.344
Shit! Hello?

00:51.427 --> 00:53.930
Hey! Baby, where are you?
Are you still at work?

00:54.096 --> 00:55.348
No! Not even close.

00:55.431 --> 00:56.933
Just so you know,
the movie starts in 10 minutes.

00:57.016 --> 00:58.809
– I know! Give me your pants.
– What?

00:58.935 --> 01:00.519
– I'll buy you lunch tomorrow. Come on.
– No.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.480
I'm your boss. Give me your pants.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.024
Please try not to be late.
I really hate missing the beginning.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.275
I know. I know.

01:08.277 --> 01:09.779
Give me your pants. I'm coming, baby.

01:10.780 --> 01:11.781
I'm almost there!

01:12.114 --> 01:14.283
– How far away?
– I think I see you!

01:15.785 --> 01:17.995
– Where are you? I'm here.
– So am I.

01:18.329 --> 01:19.914
So many people. What are you wearing?

01:19.997 --> 01:22.458
I'm wearing the only clothes
outside the theatre,

01:22.541 --> 01:25.294
because I'm the only person
outside the theatre!

01:25.461 --> 01:27.505
I love that outfit. You look so sexy in that.

01:27.630 --> 01:29.131
You know that I love this movie.

01:29.215 --> 01:32.969
If a prostitute and a ruthless businessman
can fall in love,

01:33.844 --> 01:34.887
then anyone can.

01:34.971 --> 01:37.139
I know this means a lot to you,
which means it means a lot to me.

01:37.223 --> 01:38.641
Well, apparently it doesn't.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.059
I'm looking at you right now. I can see you!

01:40.309 --> 01:41.477
Jamie!

01:42.186 --> 01:43.229
Hey!

01:44.480 --> 01:45.523
– Hey.
– You made it.

01:45.648 --> 01:47.400
– Yeah. Hey.
– Hi.

01:47.483 --> 01:49.986
– Sorry I'm late.
– It's okay. I got us sandwiches.

01:50.069 --> 01:52.405
I got you turkey, no cheese,
gluten-free bread.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.490
You sure this was prepared
in a nut-free facility?

01:55.032 --> 01:56.826
Yes, I'm fully aware of your allergies.

01:56.993 --> 02:00.830
Hey, I'm here! I'm here. I'm really sorry.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.665
We missed <i>Your Body Is a Wonderland</i>.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.709
Okay. Only one song.
That's not so bad, right?

02:04.834 --> 02:06.210
It was fucking <i>Your Body Is a Wonderland</i>!

02:06.335 --> 02:10.172
Well, the good news is,
he has so many good ones.

02:10.381 --> 02:13.968
Here's an idea: next time,
instead of being late, just shit on my face.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.721
'Cause that's kind of the same thing
as missing <i>Your Body Is a Wonderland</i>.

02:16.846 --> 02:17.972
Okay, come on. We really gotta go in.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.266
Julia Roberts is about to put on
her really tall boots.

02:22.101 --> 02:23.394
We need to talk.

02:27.606 --> 02:28.691
I think we should take a break.

02:28.774 --> 02:31.110
I just feel like
we should chill for a while, you know?

02:31.193 --> 02:32.987
– You're doing this?
– You're breaking up with me?

02:33.070 --> 02:34.405
You said I was your soul mate.

02:34.572 --> 02:35.740
I did? When?

02:35.865 --> 02:38.325
When we were at that bed and breakfast
having sex.

02:38.409 --> 02:39.910
– But, you know, that doesn't…
– That doesn't what?

02:40.202 --> 02:43.205
– Count.
– I was tied up at work. I'm sorry.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.624
Maybe you should care
a little bit less about work

02:45.708 --> 02:47.918
and a little more
about the girl that you're dating.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.422
'Cause last time I checked,
work doesn't reassure you

02:51.547 --> 02:54.008
that liking a finger up your ass
doesn't make you gay.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.927
I never said "go up." Okay?

02:57.053 --> 03:00.431
I just said lightly around…
It's like a little button.

03:00.556 --> 03:02.433
You know what? Not your issue anymore.

03:02.558 --> 03:03.684
Is this why you were late?

03:03.768 --> 03:05.269
You were worried
about how to break up with me?

03:05.394 --> 03:07.730
Oh, no, no.
I was trying to decide what to wear.

03:07.897 --> 03:10.066
– So, you went with sneakers and a hoodie.
– Yeah.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.901
What, are you gonna
take the SATs after this?

03:12.068 --> 03:13.819
Don't lash out, okay?

03:13.903 --> 03:15.613
– You're better than that.
– I'm really not.

03:15.738 --> 03:17.406
I just think
we're heading in different directions.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.909
Yeah, you to the John Mayer concert
and me not.

03:20.076 --> 03:22.411
Thank you for doing this
before the concert, by the way.

03:22.745 --> 03:24.497
Best breakup ever.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.749
He is the Sheryl Crow of our generation!

03:26.916 --> 03:28.167
Let me just ask you a quick question.

03:28.250 --> 03:32.254
And just know that I am not at all
crushed by this breakup.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.256
So, be honest. Why?

03:34.340 --> 03:35.633
– Wait, is this a trick?
– No.

03:35.758 --> 03:37.593
Just pure anthropological research.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.678
Okay. You want someone
to sweep you off your feet,

03:39.762 --> 03:42.556
but you're more interested
in getting swept off your feet

03:42.640 --> 03:43.849
than the someone who's doing the sweeping.

03:44.183 --> 03:46.143
You seem like you've got it totally together,

03:46.268 --> 03:48.104
but you're actually
really emotionally damaged.

03:48.187 --> 03:51.649
Also, you have, like, really big eyes,
and that freaks me out sometimes…

03:51.774 --> 03:53.859
Thank you. That's enough.

03:53.943 --> 03:55.403
It is not you at all.

03:55.486 --> 03:58.614
Of course it's me! You can't say that.
You're breaking up with me!

03:58.864 --> 04:01.492
It's not. It's me. I don't like you anymore.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.994
This is my fault. You deserve better than me.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.329
You're a great guy.

04:05.454 --> 04:08.749
A little too emotionally unavailable,
if you ask me.

04:08.833 --> 04:09.875
I didn't.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.210
I really want to stay friends.

04:11.293 --> 04:12.795
– Let's stay friends.
– Sure.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.046
Totally.

04:16.132 --> 04:17.173
John Mayer.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.510
John fucking Mayer!

04:20.386 --> 04:21.470
Come here, you.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.140
You're gonna get through this.

04:26.475 --> 04:31.313
Why do relationships always start off so fun
and then turn into suck-a-bag-o-dicks?

04:31.397 --> 04:35.651
I really have to stop buying into this bullshit
Hollywood cliché of true love.

04:36.694 --> 04:39.530
Shut up, Katherine Heigl! You stupid liar!

04:39.655 --> 04:42.825
I'm just gonna work and fuck.
Like George Clooney.

04:42.992 --> 04:45.661
I'm just gonna
shut myself down emotionally.

04:47.329 --> 04:48.998
Like George Clooney.

04:58.507 --> 04:59.550
Hello.

05:00.009 --> 05:01.177
Seat up, please, sir.

05:02.011 --> 05:03.012
Is that the Hudson River?

05:03.721 --> 05:05.890
No. It's the East River.

05:06.182 --> 05:10.019
So we won't be landing on it, then,
like that flight,

05:10.394 --> 05:13.272
you know, with that captain
they keep giving medals to?

05:14.523 --> 05:15.941
That pilot was a hero.

05:18.444 --> 05:19.528
Asshole.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.865
Plane actually did a lot of the work.

05:24.033 --> 05:26.869
I think I found the perfect guy
to fill that job at <i>GQ</i>.

05:27.286 --> 05:29.205
No, he's landing early. I'm scrambling.

05:29.580 --> 05:32.458
No, he's not sold on the job yet,
but I'll get him there. I always do.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.793
I'm even picking him up in a hybrid.

05:35.211 --> 05:37.588
He's from LA.
I figured he's into all that bullshit.

05:38.047 --> 05:39.965
Hey, sir, what's that tall building over there?

05:40.799 --> 05:41.884
Empire State Building.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.427
No, no, no, no. No. The other one.

05:43.552 --> 05:47.348
The really, really tall one
with the antenna on top of it, the windows.

05:47.431 --> 05:48.933
That is Empire State Building.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.602
Oh, yeah. You're right. <i>King Kong</i>.

05:51.727 --> 05:52.770
Hey…

05:57.274 --> 06:00.069
Oh, hey! Are you done with this? All met up?

06:00.152 --> 06:02.738
Great. Welcome to New York,
Ms Penderghast.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.281
Yeah.

06:14.750 --> 06:18.128
Oh, no. Excuse me. Sorry.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.421
Okay.

06:23.676 --> 06:25.803
– Can you hand me my bag?
– Sure. Which one?

06:25.928 --> 06:27.012
– The one with the straps.
– Okay.

06:27.096 --> 06:28.180
There.

06:28.681 --> 06:29.932
Okay.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.102
– Thank you.
– Welcome to New York, sir.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.482
– Excuse me.
– Yeah.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.277
That's me.
Which one, the blue or the yellow?

06:41.652 --> 06:44.446
No. The makeshift sign made out of lipstick,
that's me.

06:45.281 --> 06:46.991
– You're Dylan Harper.
– I am.

06:47.283 --> 06:48.367
I'm Jamie Rellis.

06:48.534 --> 06:51.203
– You're picking me up from the airport.
– Hi. Yes, I am.

06:52.371 --> 06:53.580
You always pick people up like this?

06:53.664 --> 06:55.541
Yeah, you know,
I like to keep things interesting.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.167
– Welcome to New York.
– Thank you.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.879
You're not exactly what comes to mind
when you think headhunter.

07:00.963 --> 07:04.174
Yeah, I prefer "executive recruiter."
Headhunter sounds a little creepy.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.802
You did stalk me for six months.
Kind of creepy.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.554
Here, here, here, I'll take it.

07:09.305 --> 07:11.515
You're really gonna carry my bag?
You're that girl?

07:11.724 --> 07:14.727
No. I'm gonna change your life. I'm that girl.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.062
My life is already pretty great.

07:17.146 --> 07:20.482
Oh, really? 'Cause you wouldn't be here
if your life were already pretty great.

07:20.983 --> 07:23.319
A free trip to New York.
I'd be an idiot to turn that down.

07:23.402 --> 07:26.322
Well, then I guess you must have been
an idiot for the past six months.

07:27.406 --> 07:29.533
Yeah, a lot of people
would say longer than that.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.535
<i>It's a huge opportunity, Dylan.</i>

07:31.660 --> 07:34.580
Art director of <i>GQ</i> magazine.
This is the big leagues.

07:35.039 --> 07:36.832
I mean, no offence to your little blog
on the Internet.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.917
Which got six million hits last month.

07:39.043 --> 07:41.920
I could put up a video of me mixing
cake batter with my boobs

07:42.171 --> 07:43.547
and it will get eight million hits.

07:43.672 --> 07:46.675
It's been done. Dunkin-My-Tits-Hynes.com.

07:47.176 --> 07:48.177
Really?

07:48.844 --> 07:51.639
Well, look, there's no question that
you are talented at what you do,

07:51.722 --> 07:53.515
but this is <i>GQ</i>.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.434
New York's so crowded.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.562
Look around. I'm from LA, okay?

07:58.687 --> 08:01.774
– I like my open spaces.
– What are you, a gazelle?

08:02.232 --> 08:04.068
Come on,
what's really worrying you about this?

08:06.278 --> 08:10.199
I don't know. I don't want to be the guy
who took something legendary

08:10.282 --> 08:13.035
and shit the bed with it.
Excuse the expression.

08:13.369 --> 08:16.080
Well, then don't be the guy who shit the bed.
Excuse the expression.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.249
Be the guy
who made the bed legendary again.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.587
Listen, we'll get some coffee in you
before the interview. You'll be fine.

08:23.879 --> 08:28.801
I'm sorry, not coffee.
Some green tea, soy, organic hemp bullshit.

08:29.802 --> 08:30.928
Really hot in New York.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.554
Doesn't it get hot in LA?

08:32.638 --> 08:34.515
Yeah, it gets hot in LA, but it's the humidity.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.393
In LA, if it's 90 degrees,
it feels like 90 degrees. But…

08:37.558 --> 08:38.936
– Right.
– If it's hot in New York,

08:39.102 --> 08:40.895
it's 90 degrees, it's like 100,000 degrees.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.148
This conversation about weather
is really fascinating,

08:43.232 --> 08:44.983
but lucky for me, we are here.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.486
So, good luck.

08:48.320 --> 08:52.116
Whatever happens, happens.
I told you, I don't really want it.

08:52.408 --> 08:55.411
Just do me a favour?
Act like you do so that I look good.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.788
– I can do that.
– Okay. Go get 'em.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.248
This is great, by the way.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.342
Watch it!

09:20.936 --> 09:22.938
– Hey!
– You're still here?

09:23.272 --> 09:25.482
Yeah. Well, it's my job.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.650
Nice.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.278
So, tell me, how'd it go?

09:30.112 --> 09:32.239
They bought it.
You're safe for a little while longer.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.616
Well, thank you. I owe you one.

09:38.954 --> 09:39.997
This is from you.

09:40.456 --> 09:41.498
It's your offer.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.126
– Wait, I got it?
– They called about five minutes ago.

09:45.294 --> 09:48.297
Congratulations. Offer expires at midnight.

09:49.465 --> 09:51.133
Why didn't you just tell me
instead of texting me?

09:51.300 --> 09:52.634
'Cause it's more dramatic.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.972
Dylan, you are not gonna shit the bed.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.475
I've seen your work. It's amazing.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.351
It's a huge move.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.645
Would you uproot your entire life for a job?
Be honest.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.981
Well, no. For a job, probably not.

10:06.231 --> 10:09.985
But for New York? Yeah, I would.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.362
Which is why I'm not gonna
try to sell you on the job,

10:12.488 --> 10:13.739
I'm gonna sell you on New York.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.157
It's New York!

10:15.491 --> 10:16.533
I've seen <i>Seinfeld</i>.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.744
Not the bullshit tourist version.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.956
Puppy dog eyes. Nice touch.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.500
Yes! Come on.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.001
Let me buy you a drink.

10:29.505 --> 10:30.547
What's wrong?

10:31.048 --> 10:32.591
What are you waiting for?

10:32.716 --> 10:33.801
The light to change.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.511
You LA folk are so cute.

10:35.844 --> 10:36.929
Come on.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.138
Come on, it's fine.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.264
– See?
– Yep.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.432
I'm gonna die.

10:40.516 --> 10:44.520
Here we have Brooklyn Bridge,
downtown Manhattan,

10:45.020 --> 10:47.856
and right in front of us, an outdoor bar.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.568
Alcohol. Now we're talking.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.198
You know, I like you.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.075
I'll give you your choice of closes.

10:59.243 --> 11:01.453
– What?
– How I close you on this job.

11:01.537 --> 11:04.081
– Okay.
– So we got the flattery close.

11:04.373 --> 11:07.793
Dylan, you are so good at what you do.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.211
The take-it-or-leave-it close.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.214
Man, I don't care if you take it.
I get paid regardless.

11:12.464 --> 11:13.799
The sympathy close.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.342
You see, my kidneys are failing…

11:15.425 --> 11:17.970
Why do women think the only way
to get a man to do what they want

11:18.053 --> 11:19.221
is to manipulate him?

11:19.388 --> 11:23.225
History. Personal experience.
Romantic comedies.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.562
Come on, you're here for a reason,
whether you want to admit it or not.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.815
Yeah, to explore an option.
Who wouldn't want to know their options?

11:29.982 --> 11:31.400
Someone who's in the perfect situation.

11:31.608 --> 11:32.734
Are you in the perfect situation?

11:32.818 --> 11:34.903
Job? Absolutely.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.239
Everything else? None of your business.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.536
Shaun!

11:42.911 --> 11:43.912
– Jamie!
– Hey!

11:44.037 --> 11:45.664
– Hey, what's up, baby?
– What are you doing here?

11:45.747 --> 11:46.832
– Shaun White?
– You look great.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.084
– You been working out?
– Nope. Just been eating a lot.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.460
– Okay.
– Yeah.

11:50.586 --> 11:51.670
– You want a drink?
– Yeah!

11:51.753 --> 11:52.921
– Let me get you a drink. Yeah?
– Okay.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.424
– Careful! Careful.
– Sorry.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.468
Hey, bro, that was like
a double McTwist 1260.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.472
– Yeah, like the trick.
– Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dylan.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.141
Jamie, you want to get this guy
out of my face

12:04.266 --> 12:05.601
before I break his fucking skull?

12:06.935 --> 12:08.812
Sorry, bro. No disrespect. I'm a huge fan.

12:08.937 --> 12:12.316
You don't fucking know me, man!
Don't talk to me like you know me!

12:12.441 --> 12:15.110
What, you think I'm all chill
'cause I snowboard and shit?

12:15.277 --> 12:17.779
One more word,
I'll fuck you up like dynamite!

12:18.614 --> 12:19.656
Dynamite?

12:19.948 --> 12:21.617
I'm just playing, bro.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.620
Any friend of Jamie's is cool with me.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.122
– It's all good, man.
– All good.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.791
I'm whispering in the ear of a dead man.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.585
I'll see you later.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.753
– Good to see you.
– Bye, honey.

12:34.129 --> 12:37.841
Shaun White seems really great. Nice dude.

12:38.634 --> 12:40.802
– How do you know him again?
– I took his virginity.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.388
So you guys have known
each other for a while?

12:43.472 --> 12:44.973
No, it was like eight months ago.

12:45.807 --> 12:46.850
Wow.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.186
So does the carpet match the drapes?

12:49.645 --> 12:52.022
It's hardwood floors,
if you know what I mean.

12:52.147 --> 12:54.274
My God! Terrible visual.

12:54.358 --> 12:56.985
Totally kidding, by the way.
Just an old friend of mine.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.155
You guys use the same leave-in conditioner.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.449
His hair had nice body.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.451
Can I get two gyro number sixes,
extra sauce?

13:06.662 --> 13:08.038
– What are you looking for?
– The cops.

13:08.330 --> 13:09.706
– Come on.
– The cops?

13:09.831 --> 13:10.999
Yep.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.001
Come on!

13:16.046 --> 13:17.839
– Where are you taking me?
– You'll see.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.814
Well, here's your open space.

13:33.897 --> 13:36.358
Run, gazelle. Run!

13:39.069 --> 13:43.198
– Wow. This is unbelievable.
– I know.

13:46.702 --> 13:48.704
Okay, this was not on <i>Seinfeld</i>.

13:49.413 --> 13:51.873
Come on,
what's your dad think about all this?

13:54.042 --> 13:55.419
About what?

13:55.669 --> 13:56.670
Well, he must have an opinion.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.839
He used to write for the <i>LA Times</i>
for 23 years.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.341
Somebody did their homework.

14:01.675 --> 14:05.679
I have this thing at work. It's called Google.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.931
Come on, what's he think about the job?

14:09.099 --> 14:10.183
Actually, I didn't ask him.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.227
Well, then you must know what he'd say.

14:16.857 --> 14:21.361
He'd tell me to go with my gut and that
he'd be proud of me no matter what I did.

14:23.572 --> 14:24.906
Sounds like a really great man.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.076
Yeah, he is.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.871
Hey, do you want to
see something really cool?

14:31.121 --> 14:33.457
I always want to see something really cool.
What…

14:33.915 --> 14:34.958
Come on.

14:36.293 --> 14:37.586
Okay.

14:39.588 --> 14:42.257
Only place in the city
you can actually see the stars.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.426
– Wow.
– Yeah.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.762
– It's pretty awesome.
– I know.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.139
I like to come up here to think.

14:49.264 --> 14:52.100
Just when it gets a little too much
for me down there, it's like…

14:52.768 --> 14:54.478
It's like my New York version
of a mountaintop.

14:55.312 --> 14:58.148
Best part, no cell reception.

15:01.318 --> 15:02.819
You take all your recruits up here?

15:04.905 --> 15:07.282
Actually, never really taken anyone up here.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.451
– Really?
– Yeah.

15:09.785 --> 15:11.077
Thanks.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.413
If you tell anyone about this,
I will rip your ears off

15:13.497 --> 15:15.248
and staple them to your neck.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.169
Everyone in this city seems really violent.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.798
Come on, let's go. One last stop.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.509
– We're just getting comfortable.
– I know you are. Come on, buddy.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.969
It's New York. Now hustle. Come on.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.722
– Come on, come on.
– You're showing me Times Square.

15:30.806 --> 15:33.183
– This is not touristy at all!
– Would you shush? Come on.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.602
Do we have to power-walk
everywhere we go?

15:35.685 --> 15:36.978
Yes.

15:37.145 --> 15:40.899
So everybody just kind of walks
wherever they want, then.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.026
How 'bout right here?

15:43.360 --> 15:44.694
– What do you mean?
– We're here.

15:50.826 --> 15:52.160
Oh, my God, it's 1988.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.496
All right, smartass, give it five seconds.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.731
– What is this?
– It's a flash mob.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.317
– Like on <i>Oprah</i>!
– Exactly.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.027
Should we get out of the way?

16:26.153 --> 16:28.238
No, no. Enjoy it. Take it all in.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.243
– It's pretty damn cool.
– Right?

16:37.205 --> 16:38.373
It's kind of rad.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.376
Do these people get paid for this?

16:42.335 --> 16:45.255
No. No. They kind of just do it for fun.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.174
It's nice to feel
like you're a part of something.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.218
New York can be a little bit lonely at times.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.012
And you're trying to sell me on it.

16:52.262 --> 16:55.390
Every place can be a bit lonely sometimes.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.730
– Be careful!
– Oh, my God.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.565
– Come down.
– Okay.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.407
– Shit. Get back down.
– Okay.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.878
– I'm in.
– What?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.381
– You sold me.
– Really?

17:28.464 --> 17:30.133
– I'll take the job.
– Oh, my God!

17:30.258 --> 17:34.804
– What, are you surprised?
– No! No. Oh, you are gonna crush it!

17:35.931 --> 17:37.599
Amazing.

17:37.807 --> 17:41.269
– You can all go home now! Thank you!
– Very funny.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.437
Come on.

17:42.604 --> 17:45.273
Congratulations, sell-out!

17:45.398 --> 17:46.775
Thank you, thank you.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.152
All I'm saying is,
it wasn't so much the pilot's skill

17:49.277 --> 17:52.239
that landed that plane on the river
as much as the mechanics of the aircraft.

17:52.322 --> 17:54.741
Are you saying
that Captain Sully wasn't a hero?

17:54.824 --> 17:56.117
No, no.

17:56.785 --> 17:57.953
There were just other factors.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.955
Are you not an American?

18:11.633 --> 18:14.302
Hey, fuckface, you want to get your shit
out of my car or what?

18:14.636 --> 18:15.929
I… Yeah.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.141
Welcome to New York. Go and fuck a dick.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.792
Fuck.

18:45.875 --> 18:49.462
So, all I ask is that you give me
a little bit of time to gain your trust.

18:49.546 --> 18:54.175
I know that I'm new at this, but what I lack
in experience I make up for in clichés.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.844
So, my door is always open.

18:57.554 --> 19:01.349
But seriously, my door is always open.

19:04.019 --> 19:07.230
My first order of business, lighter doors.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.692
– Okay. Thanks, guys.
– Welcome, Dylan.

19:11.359 --> 19:14.237
Hey, man. Tommy Bollinger, sports editor.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.032
Tommy, I've read your articles.
Love your writing.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.783
Just trying to keep it realsies.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.078
Listen, I'd love to take you out one night
and troll for cock.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.581
– What?
– You got some pretty boys out there in LA,

19:24.706 --> 19:28.376
but the quality in this town is ridiculous.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.545
We can tear this shit up.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.213
I'm not gay, Tommy.

19:32.380 --> 19:36.009
Really? I just assumed,
art director and, you know…

19:36.176 --> 19:38.428
Hey. No skin, more pipe for me.

19:38.553 --> 19:41.264
By the way,
doing a piece on racism in hockey.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.516
Love to get your concepts on the font.

19:43.725 --> 19:47.437
I'm thinking Helvetica
but I could be persuaded to Courier New.

19:47.562 --> 19:50.774
But what the fuck do I know?
I'm just the sports editor.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.902
– You sure you're not gay?
– Yep.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.236
– I'm sure.
– Okay.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.030
All right.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.034
– Hey.
– Hey.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.703
I'd knock, but you don't have a door.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.163
– I don't.
– No.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.414
Hey, check this out.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.917
<i>Dunkin-My-Tits-Hynes.com.</i>

20:09.042 --> 20:12.253
– Yeah, it really does exist.
– I told you, but not that. This.

20:14.422 --> 20:15.423
Awesome.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.258
But it'd be even more awesome
if this happened.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.261
Wait for it.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.180
Nice!

20:22.263 --> 20:24.390
I got in touch with a guy
who puts flash mobs together.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.810
We're thinking about using them
for guerrilla advertising.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.270
Taking something so pure
and commercializing it?

20:29.813 --> 20:31.064
Knew I found the right guy.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.274
– Here I am.
– Okay. Here's your contract.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.943
Sign it and I will be out of here.

20:35.902 --> 20:36.945
Okay.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.948
A whole year?

20:40.740 --> 20:43.910
Why do I get the feeling this is the first
real commitment you've ever made?

20:43.993 --> 20:46.413
It's not. T-Mobile, two years.

20:46.496 --> 20:47.664
And, fuck, do I regret that one.

20:47.831 --> 20:50.291
Do me a favour.
Don't quit or get fired before the year's up,

20:50.417 --> 20:51.835
because otherwise I don't get my bonus.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.336
Wait, I can leave whenever I want?

20:54.170 --> 20:56.131
– What's the point of this contract?
– Just sign the damn thing.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.465
Okay.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.137
Nice doing business with you, Dylan Harper.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.474
Hey, I was thinking of getting some lunch.
Do you know a place?

21:08.601 --> 21:09.811
Are you asking me out?

21:10.979 --> 21:12.438
Whoa, I'm not asking you out.

21:12.522 --> 21:13.690
I'm asking you to show me a restaurant.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.442
I mean, I'm the only friend you have
in New York.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.777
– You don't wanna complicate that.
– I know. I'm not asking you out.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.863
I mean, sure, we'd have fun, roll around,

21:19.988 --> 21:22.157
– get into some erotic humiliation fantasy.
– Erotic?

21:22.282 --> 21:25.618
But it'd all blow up in our faces, end badly,
and we'd never speak to each other again.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.328
I'm not fucking asking you out!
I swear to God!

21:27.454 --> 21:29.706
Okay. You don't like me like that.

21:29.998 --> 21:32.000
You don't have to be so mean about it.

21:33.168 --> 21:34.961
I'm sorry. I didn't…

21:36.171 --> 21:38.506
God, you're such a girl.
Come on, it's my treat.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.676
So was it an easy move?

21:41.843 --> 21:43.678
– It was tough leaving my dad.
– Yeah.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.138
My sister gave me some shit.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.390
But timing was right.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.269
Timing was really right.

21:51.352 --> 21:53.563
– Is that your sister?
– No. My ex.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.857
She's great. Loves John Mayer.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.193
Wants us to stay friends.

21:59.986 --> 22:03.406
She's also convinced she can cure me
of my emotional unavailability.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.035
– You're emotionally unavailable?
– Oh, yeah.

22:07.202 --> 22:10.705
Oh, my God. I'm emotionally damaged.
I haven't seen you at the meetings.

22:11.206 --> 22:13.166
I'm done with the relationship thing.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.460
Girl, you are preaching to the congregation.

22:15.543 --> 22:16.586
– Choir.
– What?

22:16.753 --> 22:19.380
"Preaching to the choir." You're supposed
to preach to the congregation.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.424
– That's the expression.
– Did you understand what I was saying?

22:21.549 --> 22:22.592
Then don't be a dick about it.

22:24.719 --> 22:26.429
Oh, my God. Do you mind?

22:27.055 --> 22:28.348
– Please.
– Great.

22:28.556 --> 22:31.100
Hello. You've reached
Dylan Harper's cell phone.

22:31.226 --> 22:32.977
He's emotionally unavailable,
but if you'd like…

22:33.061 --> 22:35.063
<i>– John fucking Mayer!</i>
– Hello?

22:37.524 --> 22:40.527
Wow. Hello?
You really do have shitty cell service.

22:40.610 --> 22:41.736
– Right?
– Yeah.

22:44.447 --> 22:45.615
I'm gonna have some friends over tomorrow.

22:46.115 --> 22:48.076
Why don't you come,
and you can meet some new people?

22:48.576 --> 22:50.703
I'm gonna have to check my schedule.
I'm really busy.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.289
I work at <i>GQ</i> now.
It's not some little blog on the Internet.

22:56.751 --> 22:57.794
– Hey.
– Hey.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.295
– You made it.
– Sorry I'm late.

22:59.420 --> 23:02.090
No, no. Please, come in, come in. Thank you.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.092
Hey, everybody! Hey!

23:04.425 --> 23:07.262
This here is Dylan. He's from LA.

23:08.763 --> 23:10.890
He's the reason I can afford all this beer.

23:13.726 --> 23:14.769
Okay, all right.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.440
Am I an animal?

23:20.942 --> 23:21.943
Yeah.

23:22.777 --> 23:24.070
Fuck, I'm pretty good at this.

23:49.804 --> 23:53.308
Lieutenant Kali's a West Coast street artist
I got into about five years ago.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.644
– His postmodern interpretation…
– This shit is amazing.

23:56.769 --> 23:57.812
I know, right?

24:01.941 --> 24:05.445
You will be able to find the perfect candidate
to fill the position at your company.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.155
Okay, here we go.

24:08.531 --> 24:11.492
First up is Joey Morena,
who's fluent in Vietnamese

24:11.617 --> 24:13.661
and has had 10 years of experience
in the culinary field.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.129
I can't do this anymore.

24:24.547 --> 24:27.175
No, I think we both need to go get happy.

24:27.842 --> 24:29.635
It's not adding up to a hundred anymore.

24:29.719 --> 24:30.803
Yeah.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.722
<i>Looks like New York's all out of blueberries.</i>

24:33.014 --> 24:34.223
<i>Goodbye, Flapjack.</i>

24:36.392 --> 24:38.019
<i>Taxi! Taxicab!</i>

24:38.311 --> 24:39.312
<i>Flapjack.</i>

24:39.395 --> 24:41.856
Why do all these movies
have such bad music?

24:42.231 --> 24:44.692
It's so that you know how to feel
every single second.

24:44.859 --> 24:45.902
"I'm heartbroken."

24:48.571 --> 24:50.573
"I'm getting married
to the man of my dreams."

24:53.659 --> 24:55.662
"I'm sneaking through an office."

24:58.915 --> 24:59.999
<i>Madison, wait!</i>

25:00.708 --> 25:02.418
<i>Madison!</i>

25:02.543 --> 25:04.420
<i>Madison, wait!</i>

25:05.546 --> 25:06.589
<i>Bryce.</i>

25:07.173 --> 25:09.384
<i>How did you know
I was at Grand Central Station?</i>

25:09.509 --> 25:12.345
You're not. You're in Los Angeles,
where this movie was shot.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.222
<i>I know you better than you know yourself.</i>

25:15.598 --> 25:18.184
<i>And your crazy friend Susie
across the hall told me.</i>

25:18.726 --> 25:19.936
<i>Susie.</i>

25:20.853 --> 25:22.188
<i>Why are you here?</i>

25:22.397 --> 25:23.606
<i>To tell you that</i>

25:24.732 --> 25:26.609
<i>I love that sunsets make you cry,</i>

25:27.235 --> 25:30.071
<i>and I don't care that you failed
your real estate exam,</i>

25:30.697 --> 25:32.615
<i>and I'm glad that you have a five-date rule.</i>

25:33.908 --> 25:35.785
<i>And that I love you.</i>

25:36.411 --> 25:37.954
<i>Not as much as I love you.</i>

25:40.415 --> 25:42.583
<i>Now boarding, track 5, love.</i>

25:43.084 --> 25:45.420
God, I wish my life was a movie sometimes.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.547
You know, I'd never have to worry
about my hair,

25:47.797 --> 25:49.382
or having to go to the bathroom.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.968
And then, when I'm at my lowest point,

25:52.260 --> 25:55.430
some guy would chase me down the street,
pour his heart out,

25:55.596 --> 25:56.639
and we'd kiss.

25:57.473 --> 25:58.808
Happily ever after.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.603
I mean, a horse and carriage?

26:02.770 --> 26:05.773
Come on, that is awesome.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.359
Not as awesome as this
ambiguously upbeat pop song

26:08.443 --> 26:10.069
that has nothing to do with the plot

26:10.153 --> 26:14.907
they put in at the end to try to convince you
that you had a great time at this shitty movie.

26:15.950 --> 26:18.953
You know, why don't they ever make a movie
about what happens after the big kiss?

26:19.078 --> 26:20.246
They do. It's called porn.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.250
God, I miss sex.

26:25.626 --> 26:27.628
Right? I mean, sometimes you just need it.
It's like…

26:28.921 --> 26:30.631
I don't know, it's like cracking your neck.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.800
Why does it always gotta
come with complications?

26:32.925 --> 26:34.802
– And emotions.
– And guilt.

26:35.303 --> 26:36.304
Guilt.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.681
– It's women's fault.
– What?

26:38.848 --> 26:42.518
You heard me. "Hold me.
Let's spend the rest of our lives together."

26:42.643 --> 26:44.020
Oh, please, you are no better.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.982
"Oh, yeah, baby, come on, now.
Say my name. Yeah…

26:48.816 --> 26:50.693
"I'm done. How was I?"

26:50.818 --> 26:51.819
Who have you been with?

26:53.279 --> 26:54.822
Why can't it not be like that?

26:54.989 --> 26:59.368
It's a physical act. Like playing tennis.

26:59.827 --> 27:02.038
Two people should be able to have sex
like they're playing tennis.

27:02.163 --> 27:03.956
Yeah, I mean, no one wants to
go away for the weekend

27:04.040 --> 27:05.333
after they play tennis.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.711
It's just a game.
You shake hands, get on with your shit.

27:09.003 --> 27:10.171
– Yeah.
– Yeah.

27:12.673 --> 27:13.883
Do you want more beer?

27:14.842 --> 27:16.010
Okay.

27:23.726 --> 27:24.811
– Jamie!
– Yeah?

27:25.394 --> 27:27.104
– Let's play tennis.
– What?

27:27.188 --> 27:28.564
Let's have sex like we're playing tennis.

27:28.689 --> 27:29.899
Get the hell out of here.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.693
Don't laugh. This could be great.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.403
This could take all the weirdness out of it.

27:34.529 --> 27:36.948
Well, we talked about this.
I don't like you like that.

27:37.031 --> 27:39.575
I don't like you like that either.
That's why it's perfect.

27:40.701 --> 27:42.495
I don't even know if I find you attractive.

27:42.578 --> 27:43.704
That's cute.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.414
Well, I do have a thing for jerks.

27:46.541 --> 27:48.167
Okay, well, do you even find me attractive?

27:48.251 --> 27:49.669
– That's cute.
– No, no, no.

27:49.752 --> 27:52.213
Before you got to know
my awesome personality.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.381
Strictly physical.

27:54.257 --> 27:55.675
First time you saw me.

27:57.051 --> 27:59.220
– This is just two people talking?
– Yeah.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.723
Two girls over drinks at Bennigan's. Go.

28:04.392 --> 28:07.395
I liked your eyes. I didn't think
I'd ever seen such big, beautiful eyes.

28:10.356 --> 28:13.526
Your lips. Yeah.
I thought you might be a good kisser.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.027
I am.

28:15.528 --> 28:16.904
– Your breasts.
– What about them?

28:17.029 --> 28:18.322
– They intrigued me.
– Really?

28:18.406 --> 28:20.700
– Yeah.
– I think they're so tiny.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.743
– They're still breasts.
– Thanks.

28:23.953 --> 28:25.454
– I liked your hands.
– Mouth.

28:25.788 --> 28:26.831
– Butt.
– Voice.

28:26.914 --> 28:27.957
– Chest.
– Eyes.

28:28.082 --> 28:29.625
– You said that.
– I meant it.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.756
You swear you don't want anything more
from me other than sex?

28:35.882 --> 28:37.592
You swear you don't want anything
more from me?

28:38.217 --> 28:41.262
I know how you girls get.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

28:41.387 --> 28:42.430
Stop it.

28:43.472 --> 28:47.435
– What are you doing?
– I'm pulling up my Bible app.

28:47.727 --> 28:50.396
– You have a Bible app?
– Yes. I am a good girl.

28:50.605 --> 28:51.772
– Hand on the iPad.
– Okay.

28:51.981 --> 28:53.274
Wait, no.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.609
Why can't they figure this out?

28:54.984 --> 28:58.112
No… This thing thinks I'm you and you're me.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.697
Keep your hand still. I'll move the iPad.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.115
– It's actually making me dizzy.
– Hold on.

29:02.450 --> 29:03.659
There we go.

29:07.830 --> 29:09.457
No relationship.

29:09.832 --> 29:11.000
No emotions.

29:11.751 --> 29:12.752
Just sex.

29:12.835 --> 29:15.463
Whatever happens, we stay friends.

29:15.755 --> 29:16.756
– Swear.
– Swear.

29:16.839 --> 29:17.924
– Swear.
– Swear.

29:22.136 --> 29:23.304
Okay.

29:27.850 --> 29:30.311
So I guess we should just start.

29:31.646 --> 29:32.813
Okay.

29:33.981 --> 29:34.982
I'll serve.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.401
That's really… That's enough of the tennis.

29:37.485 --> 29:38.569
Let's go to the bedroom.

29:38.653 --> 29:40.655
What's wrong with the couch?
It's less emotional.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.114
The bedroom has better light.

29:42.365 --> 29:44.909
And since we're just friends,
I don't have to be insecure about my body.

29:44.992 --> 29:46.994
Come on, okay? You're beautiful.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.163
You have nothing to be insecure about.

29:50.706 --> 29:53.209
No, you see,
that is way too emotionally supportive

29:53.334 --> 29:55.294
and you need to just lock that down.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.632
– Your ass is a little bony.
– Much better.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.677
My nipples are sensitive,
I don't like dirty talk,

30:02.802 --> 30:05.805
and had I known this was gonna happen,
I would have shaved my legs this morning.

30:05.888 --> 30:08.432
My chin is ticklish,
I sneeze sometimes after I come,

30:08.516 --> 30:09.975
and if I'd have known
this was gonna happen,

30:10.059 --> 30:11.268
I wouldn't have shaved my legs this morning.

30:11.352 --> 30:12.520
Okie-dokie.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.149
I keep my socks on. Intimacy issues.

30:17.233 --> 30:19.151
Great, 'cause feet gross me out.
Daddy issues.

30:19.235 --> 30:20.569
Great.

30:24.699 --> 30:25.991
I can work with that.

30:28.869 --> 30:29.912
Should be fine.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.250
I can't believe I'm doing this.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.293
Should we stop? We could just go for a run.

30:36.377 --> 30:37.920
I don't know, are we getting too old for this?

30:38.879 --> 30:40.589
– Sex?
– No, casual sex.

30:40.715 --> 30:43.426
It just, I don't know, feels a little collegey.

30:43.718 --> 30:45.553
– I could sing some Third Eye Blind.
– Okay.

30:49.098 --> 30:51.475
– That's not Third Eye Blind.
– I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.

30:51.559 --> 30:52.601
Nope.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.566
– What's wrong?
– We're just doing this once.

30:58.691 --> 30:59.859
– I totally agree.
– Okay.

30:59.942 --> 31:01.152
– Great.
– Great.

31:01.235 --> 31:02.445
Little faster.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.572
– More circular.
– Watch my chin.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.073
– Touch my ears.
– Okay.

31:07.616 --> 31:08.951
Kiss my neck.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.620
– Say my name.
– Dylan Francis Harper Jr.

31:11.746 --> 31:12.747
Not my full name.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.081
Sorry, I had to fill out
a lot of your paperwork.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.249
– Stop talking.
– Okay.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.251
Oh, my God, you're really…

31:19.086 --> 31:24.592
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P…

31:24.717 --> 31:27.053
– Dylan, I…
– Relax.

31:27.136 --> 31:29.305
Just a friend going down on another friend.

31:29.430 --> 31:31.140
Oh, yeah, baby. Tornado.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.437
What, what?

31:36.604 --> 31:38.689
What are you trying to do?
Dig your way to China?

31:38.773 --> 31:40.149
– I'm good at this.
– Says who?

31:40.274 --> 31:41.609
Every girl I've been with.

31:41.734 --> 31:44.111
Well, they're either lying
or their vaginas are made out of burlap.

31:44.278 --> 31:46.113
So, relax. You're not a lizard.

31:46.447 --> 31:47.948
– Okay, fine.
– Okay, fine.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.244
– A little to the right.
– Okay.

31:52.453 --> 31:54.079
– A little bit more to the left.
– Roger that.

31:54.163 --> 31:55.623
– Now go down.
– Here we go.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.250
– A little more… Whoa, too far!
– Sorry.

32:04.006 --> 32:05.257
– What's wrong?
– Nothing!

32:05.341 --> 32:06.842
When women start to scream,
it could be misconstrued.

32:06.967 --> 32:08.427
Just keep going!

32:17.978 --> 32:19.021
Yeah, you know it.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.820
Well, let me tell you how I like it.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.739
See, most girls think
you should start off soft,

32:28.823 --> 32:32.284
but if you just get in, really go for it…

32:45.130 --> 32:46.507
Yeah, you know it.

33:05.860 --> 33:08.946
– Let's go with Obama.
– No, no, no, no!

33:09.029 --> 33:11.866
It's too easy, too predictable. Go with Shaun.

33:11.991 --> 33:16.871
He's stylish, transcendent of sport,
has an ass like a kumquat.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.874
– I hear he's kind of a jerk.
– No, he's not.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.083
You're just threatened by him

33:21.208 --> 33:23.627
because he's the greatest snow sport athlete
in the universe

33:23.711 --> 33:25.671
and he gets more squirrel than an oak tree.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.923
Hey, Dylan?
Jamie Rellis is in the lobby for you.

33:28.048 --> 33:29.091
Okay, thanks.

33:29.717 --> 33:31.510
Let's hit this after lunch. Okay, guys?

33:32.052 --> 33:34.179
Nobody wants to fuck Obama, brah.

33:34.263 --> 33:35.598
He's got ears like an elephant.

33:35.723 --> 33:37.892
That's not the part of an elephant you want.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.063
– Hi!
– Hi.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.277
Sorry to just show up like this.

33:48.444 --> 33:49.570
No, no, no, it's fine.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.405
So…

33:54.200 --> 33:55.242
– Wanna take a walk?
– Love to.

33:55.409 --> 33:57.620
Great. Okay.

34:03.417 --> 34:04.710
Okay, so about what happened, I…

34:04.793 --> 34:07.671
– It was crazy and we shouldn't have done it.
– Exactly. No, no, exactly.

34:07.755 --> 34:09.005
I mean, it is so not me.

34:09.089 --> 34:11.091
I totally agree. Let's forget it happened.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.762
Great. I mean, look,
I've had one-night stands.

34:14.887 --> 34:18.098
We both have had one-night stands,
none of which we're proud of, but…

34:19.099 --> 34:20.100
Really?

34:20.976 --> 34:23.145
Look, to think that you and I
could just have sex

34:23.270 --> 34:25.438
and without it compromising anything
was just so…

34:25.606 --> 34:27.900
– Misguided.
– Exactly.

34:28.150 --> 34:29.485
I was gonna call you this morning.

34:29.735 --> 34:30.777
But you didn't.

34:30.945 --> 34:31.946
But I didn't.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.281
And you see, it's already
coming between us and I really…

34:34.406 --> 34:35.699
I just don't want it to.

34:35.783 --> 34:36.824
It's not going to.

34:36.951 --> 34:39.828
Look, I know that I act all tough
and I talk all tough, but really…

34:39.954 --> 34:42.748
It's just a front to protect yourself
from your own vulnerability.

34:43.666 --> 34:45.292
What are you, my fucking therapist now?

34:45.501 --> 34:50.089
No, I'm a friend. Who knows that
every time you curse, you blink.

34:50.297 --> 34:53.634
– Like your body's rejecting the word.
– It does not.

34:53.801 --> 34:54.802
– Fuck you.
– Blinked.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.637
– No, I didn't fucking blink.
– Blinked again.

34:56.804 --> 34:58.430
– Shit.
– Ah, didn't blink.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.099
"Shit" you're okay with.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.184
– It was stupid.
– Yes.

35:02.309 --> 35:05.187
– We're friends, let's stay friends.
– Yes. Yes, this, I don't wanna lose this.

35:05.312 --> 35:06.438
Me neither.

35:06.647 --> 35:07.648
– Great.
– Fantastic.

35:07.815 --> 35:09.608
Portrait for the lovely couple?

35:18.158 --> 35:19.785
– What the hell are we doing?
– I don't know.

35:22.162 --> 35:24.331
– Rub my hair.
– Kiss my neck.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.502
– Watch my nipple.
– All right, all right.

35:30.337 --> 35:32.006
– I didn't know you had a tattoo.
– Yeah.

35:32.339 --> 35:33.465
Why didn't I notice that before?

35:33.674 --> 35:35.050
Because we were drunk.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.136
– Was it your dog?
– No. Never had one.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.387
But everyone else did.

35:38.512 --> 35:40.180
And I thought having a dog
meant you had a normal family,

35:40.305 --> 35:41.974
which at 17 I desperately wanted.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.976
So as a sign of rebellion you got a tattoo

35:44.184 --> 35:45.644
of the most conventional thing
you could think of.

35:45.728 --> 35:47.354
It was super awesome back then.

35:47.563 --> 35:48.647
– Check it.
– Okay.

35:48.856 --> 35:50.107
– A lightning bolt?
– Eighteen.

35:50.190 --> 35:51.400
– Wanted superpowers.
– Yeah.

35:52.359 --> 35:54.236
I was a little into Harry Potter back then.

35:54.361 --> 35:56.947
– Were you also gay back then?
– Harry Potter doesn't make you gay!

35:57.031 --> 35:58.824
– Okay.
– Are you sure about this?

35:58.907 --> 35:59.950
– Are you?
– No.

36:00.034 --> 36:01.201
Me neither.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.875
– How was your day?
– It was okay.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.210
– I had a turkey sandwich for lunch.
– How was that?

36:10.336 --> 36:12.046
It wasn't that good. How was your day?

36:12.171 --> 36:14.548
Still trying to figure out that subway system.
It is tricky.

36:17.384 --> 36:18.886
And it's out of here!

36:25.225 --> 36:26.894
– My butt.
– What?

36:27.019 --> 36:28.562
– Oh, my butt.
– Really?

36:28.729 --> 36:31.815
No, I mean my butt, it's cramping.
Can you grab a pillow?

36:31.899 --> 36:33.108
Okay, yeah, yeah.

36:34.568 --> 36:36.236
– So, no butt?
– No.

36:39.740 --> 36:42.201
– Really? Already?
– Just kidding.

36:47.122 --> 36:49.416
– Do you like this position?
– Yeah, it's all right.

36:52.044 --> 36:54.254
I gotta be honest, I feel a little emasculated.

36:55.089 --> 36:59.134
A naked girl is lying on top of you
and you feel emasculated?

37:00.469 --> 37:02.679
– Little bit.
– You do know what that word means, right?

37:02.763 --> 37:04.807
Yes, I know what it means, and I feel it.

37:04.932 --> 37:07.101
Okay, all right, you big baby.

37:07.643 --> 37:09.395
– Chinese fire drill.
– Okay. Go!

37:11.605 --> 37:12.773
Okay.

37:15.609 --> 37:17.069
– Do you feel manly now?
– I do.

37:17.277 --> 37:18.487
Okay. Put it in.

37:19.947 --> 37:20.948
That's not funny.

37:21.281 --> 37:22.783
– It's kind of funny.
– It's kind of funny.

37:27.287 --> 37:28.455
– Hold on.
– What's wrong?

37:28.580 --> 37:29.581
I have to go to the bathroom.

37:29.665 --> 37:32.000
– What? Now?
– Yes, now. I had a lot of watermelon.

37:43.303 --> 37:44.346
What's going on in there?

37:44.471 --> 37:46.098
Do you know how hard it is
to pee with a hard-on?

37:46.181 --> 37:47.224
No, actually.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.601
It's like two lanes of traffic merging into one.
It takes time.

37:56.275 --> 37:57.776
– Are you pooping?
– No.

37:57.860 --> 37:59.987
– Why are you sitting down?
– It's easier to control.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.990
– You want a mess in here?
– No. No, no. Sorry.

38:17.004 --> 38:18.172
Yeah.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.007
Yup.

38:23.135 --> 38:24.219
What? Did I leak?

38:24.344 --> 38:25.345
Did you wash your hands?

38:25.846 --> 38:26.889
Oh, come on, dude.

38:27.014 --> 38:28.640
I know we're just friends, but I'm still a lady.

38:29.016 --> 38:32.352
Now get back in there, wash your hands
and then bring that fine ass back here.

38:32.477 --> 38:35.022
If you keep talking to me like that,
I'm not gonna come back.

38:40.694 --> 38:43.572
– My hammies are killing me.
– Have a banana, they're in the fridge.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.073
Why would you keep bananas in the fridge?

38:45.365 --> 38:47.534
– It dries them out.
– It doesn't. They have a peel.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.161
It's not armour. Air still gets in.

38:49.244 --> 38:50.495
Do you want a banana or not?

38:50.704 --> 38:52.080
Not if they're dry. I'm not an animal.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.876
At least I have food in the house.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.836
All you have at home is drinkable yogurt.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.172
I like to drink my yogurt. It's a timesaver.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.716
Well, then you think you could use that time
to shave your stubble.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.301
Your whiskers are like knives.

39:04.384 --> 39:08.055
Now, see, if you were my girlfriend,
I couldn't tell you to shut up right now.

39:08.222 --> 39:10.557
And because you're just my buddy,
I can tell you

39:10.682 --> 39:15.395
that if you don't start shaving up here,
I'm gonna stop shaving down there.

39:20.275 --> 39:21.485
Hey, hey. Hey…

39:21.568 --> 39:23.111
– Mom!
– "Mom"?

39:24.571 --> 39:27.115
My eyes are covered.
I don't know what you're doing.

39:27.241 --> 39:29.910
I can't see you putting on
your black underpants.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.995
Jamie, baby, I missed you.

39:32.079 --> 39:33.413
Oh, baby.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.916
Did your boobs get bigger?
Mom, I'm over here.

39:36.458 --> 39:39.044
Hey, baby. Oh, no, they didn't.

39:39.253 --> 39:42.965
– What are you doing here?
– Victor turned out to be a total Lombard.

39:43.257 --> 39:46.593
L-O-M-B-A-R-D.
"Lots Of Money But A Real Dullard."

39:46.718 --> 39:47.970
Victor, her fiancé.

39:48.095 --> 39:49.471
Ex-fiancé.

39:49.596 --> 39:51.640
– What happened?
– Nothing. He was just blah.

39:51.765 --> 39:53.600
I mean, nice, but it was like talking to dirt.

39:53.725 --> 39:56.436
I woke up one day and I said, "Lorna…"
I'm Lorna.

39:57.437 --> 40:00.274
– Dylan.
– I said, "Lorna, this is not your bliss.

40:00.649 --> 40:02.359
– "Just because you're 39…"
– Forty-eight.

40:02.442 --> 40:05.070
"…it doesn't mean you have to settle.
He's not an insurance claim."

40:05.153 --> 40:07.030
So I caught the first plane off the island.

40:07.114 --> 40:09.783
– Cleveland's not an island.
– Oh, baby, it is.

40:10.117 --> 40:12.744
Anyway, here I am. It's so good to see you.

40:12.828 --> 40:15.247
You never told me you had a hot boyfriend.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.207
He's not my boyfriend, Mom.

40:17.291 --> 40:19.167
– That's right, we're just friends.
– I love it.

40:19.293 --> 40:21.670
It's like the '70s in here.

40:22.462 --> 40:24.631
That was a better time. Just sex.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.801
A little grass, a little glue…
Not during pregnancy.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.595
Well, not during the final trimester.

40:29.678 --> 40:32.180
But no complications. It's great!

40:33.432 --> 40:35.851
Okay, well, that's technically, I guess,
what this is.

40:36.018 --> 40:37.311
That's exactly what this is.

40:37.436 --> 40:39.271
So my daughter is just your slampiece?

40:39.479 --> 40:41.315
No, no. "Slampiece"?

40:41.440 --> 40:43.650
I'm just kidding. Slam away.

40:43.817 --> 40:45.110
Have fun. I think this is great.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.820
The only thing is, it takes you off the market.

40:46.987 --> 40:48.947
But what the hell.
The whole reason you go to the market

40:49.031 --> 40:51.783
is to buy the produce, which you already got.

40:52.993 --> 40:56.997
It's so good to see you, baby.
I'm only gonna be here a few weeks.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.999
I'm starving. You got any gin?

40:59.333 --> 41:00.959
It's in the kitchen.

41:02.461 --> 41:03.503
You gotta go.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.298
– Is she wearing Axe body spray?
– I don't know. Come on.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.675
Bananas in the refrigerator?
What are you, Puerto Rican?

41:09.009 --> 41:12.554
– That is terrible, Mother.
– Just joking. Your dad was Puerto Rican.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.181
What? You said that he was Greek.

41:14.348 --> 41:15.807
– Potato, potato…
– Get your shoes.

41:15.891 --> 41:18.435
– Okay. All right.
– Well, not… Just go, just go.

41:18.518 --> 41:20.062
I'll just put these on on the bike?

41:20.187 --> 41:21.229
– Yeah.
– Okay.

41:21.855 --> 41:22.898
It was nice to have met you…

41:23.023 --> 41:24.608
– Hey.
– And your pants are coming off.

41:24.691 --> 41:26.735
Oh, my… Mom! Mom, please!

41:29.029 --> 41:30.030
Back, back!

41:33.825 --> 41:35.911
That's what I'm talking about!

41:36.703 --> 41:39.206
We're kicking every gay ass out here!

41:39.414 --> 41:41.750
I don't say that pejoratively,
I say it hopefully.

41:41.875 --> 41:43.377
Hold it. Any of you gay?

41:43.543 --> 41:45.045
– Not even you?
– Come on, man.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.255
Come talk to me after.
Give me five minutes of your time.

41:47.381 --> 41:49.091
I might be able to let you see some reason.

41:55.263 --> 41:57.015
Look at you in the house!

41:57.099 --> 41:58.225
Come on, baby!

41:59.726 --> 42:00.852
I'm supposed to meet up with Jamie.

42:01.937 --> 42:03.605
Who's that, that headhunter?

42:03.855 --> 42:05.190
What, you guys going out now?

42:05.273 --> 42:07.901
No, no, no, we're just friends.
We're messing around a little bit.

42:08.276 --> 42:09.986
– What do you mean?
– Sleeping together.

42:10.070 --> 42:11.363
But it's just sex.

42:11.446 --> 42:13.073
That never works, bro.

42:13.198 --> 42:16.910
She's a girl. Sex always means more
to them even if they don't admit it.

42:17.077 --> 42:18.161
Jamie's different.

42:18.245 --> 42:20.831
Does she have a penis
where most girls have a vagina?

42:20.914 --> 42:22.582
– No penis.
– Then she's no different.

42:22.916 --> 42:24.292
What do you know about women, anyway?

42:24.418 --> 42:27.087
Dude, I've turned down more tail
than you'll ever have.

42:27.212 --> 42:28.296
Yeah, bro. You're gay.

42:28.630 --> 42:32.259
But the offers still keep rolling in, naturally.
Look at me.

42:32.634 --> 42:38.640
And, hey, I love women. They're beautiful,
majestic, mysterious, mesmerizing creatures.

42:38.890 --> 42:42.727
Smart, empathetic.
Far superior to men in every way.

42:43.103 --> 42:46.565
And if I had a choice,
I would be with women to my dying day.

42:46.648 --> 42:49.818
But me likes cock so I'm strict-aly dick-aly.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.238
So it's always just about sex, then?

42:53.321 --> 42:56.658
No. I've been in love.
I went down that rabbit hole.

42:56.992 --> 42:58.285
You know what I discovered?

42:58.952 --> 43:01.037
It's not who you want to spend
Friday night with,

43:01.121 --> 43:03.582
it's who you want to spend
all day Saturday with.

43:03.665 --> 43:04.750
Feel me, Felix?

43:04.833 --> 43:08.170
Yeah, but then it's every Saturday
for the rest of your life.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.088
It's okay, you don't get it.

43:10.338 --> 43:12.507
It's no big deal. But you will.

43:13.175 --> 43:17.095
One day, you'll meet someone
and it'll literally take your breath away.

43:17.262 --> 43:21.349
Like you can't breathe.
Like no oxygen to the lungs.

43:21.516 --> 43:23.852
– Like a fish…
– Yeah, I get it, Tommy.

43:24.352 --> 43:25.437
Yeah, you don't.

43:25.979 --> 43:28.356
Nice work on that new online site,
by the way.

43:28.815 --> 43:30.317
What was the font on that headline?

43:30.609 --> 43:31.693
It was Times Roman.

43:31.818 --> 43:34.112
Times Roman. Inspired. I'm out.

43:40.660 --> 43:41.703
You have a boat?

43:41.870 --> 43:45.165
I live in Jersey. And I ain't taking no ferry.

43:45.832 --> 43:47.709
Unless it's out to dinner and a show.

44:04.017 --> 44:05.018
– Hey.
– Yeah.

44:05.143 --> 44:10.440
You and that Dylan? Way to go.
I mean the whole friendship-sex thing.

44:10.524 --> 44:12.192
Kudos, baby, kudos.

44:13.693 --> 44:15.028
It's not that big of a deal.

44:15.237 --> 44:19.157
It's just surprising. I always thought
you were a true-love kind of girl.

44:19.491 --> 44:22.536
Whatever, Mom.
It's not like it's stopping me from anything.

44:22.702 --> 44:24.538
That's what I thought back in '78.

44:25.205 --> 44:26.665
And every year since.

44:26.915 --> 44:29.251
I'm just… I'm flattered, actually.

44:29.376 --> 44:31.336
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

44:32.212 --> 44:34.005
It's just surprising.

44:35.507 --> 44:38.218
– There, done. It's… There we go.
– Okay.

44:39.844 --> 44:42.848
You look great! You look great.
You look like a princess.

44:43.557 --> 44:44.724
– Yeah!
– Really?

44:44.891 --> 44:46.226
– Yeah.
– Okay.

44:46.351 --> 44:50.188
Hey, my friend gave me his house
in Montauk for July 4th.

44:50.272 --> 44:53.191
Let's you and me go away together.
No men, no bullshit.

44:53.275 --> 44:56.069
Just mother-daughter.
Like a Nora Ephron movie.

44:56.862 --> 44:59.406
When was the last time
we spent a full weekend together?

44:59.573 --> 45:02.576
When I was eight, that time in Vermont.
We got snowed in with the ski instructor.

45:02.701 --> 45:03.785
– Demitri.
– Bill.

45:03.910 --> 45:05.245
He reminded me a lot of your father.

45:05.704 --> 45:08.915
Dark curls, olive skin, Cold War accent.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.875
– My father was Russian?
– I don't remember.

45:11.042 --> 45:14.087
But what I do remember is we drank
a lot of vodka and shot a lot of guns.

45:14.379 --> 45:17.757
Mom, this "who's your daddy" game
is getting really old.

45:17.883 --> 45:20.594
I know I haven't been
the best mother in the world…

45:23.597 --> 45:25.056
I'm sorry,
were you waiting for me to jump in?

45:25.265 --> 45:28.393
Come on! Go away with me. Come on!

45:29.227 --> 45:31.062
Come on. Come on.

45:31.479 --> 45:34.316
Okay, we'll do it. It'll be fun, yeah?

45:40.947 --> 45:42.949
– Mom…
– I was trying to bond!

45:43.074 --> 45:45.452
It was either this or sniff glue.

45:50.999 --> 45:53.251
– Sorry about my mom.
– I thought she was funny.

45:53.335 --> 45:56.129
Yeah, she's really funny
when she's asking for money,

45:56.254 --> 45:58.798
and she's hilarious
when she needs a place to stay.

46:04.137 --> 46:07.265
Dylan, I think I wanna start dating again.

46:08.141 --> 46:11.144
Listen, I think we should stop this.

46:14.105 --> 46:15.440
Yeah?

46:16.149 --> 46:17.192
I kind of think you're right.

46:17.317 --> 46:18.318
Right?

46:18.526 --> 46:24.032
<i>Every new beginning
comes from some other beginning's end</i>

46:24.449 --> 46:25.909
That actually makes sense right here.

46:25.992 --> 46:27.953
Who would've thought Third Eye Blind
could be so prophetic?

46:28.036 --> 46:29.162
Not Third Eye Blind.

46:29.287 --> 46:30.997
I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.

46:31.164 --> 46:32.290
Do you wanna go grab some lunch?

46:32.374 --> 46:33.500
– Yes.
– Okay.

46:33.708 --> 46:35.293
– You're buying.
– What?

46:37.545 --> 46:38.630
Okay.

46:41.007 --> 46:42.008
– Pants.
– Shirt.

46:42.801 --> 46:43.843
So this is the end of this?

46:44.010 --> 46:45.887
– I guess so. But it's good.
– Yeah.

46:46.012 --> 46:47.389
– And we did it.
– With no bullshit.

46:47.514 --> 46:48.556
– Shirt.
– Sweater.

46:49.474 --> 46:51.309
We managed to actually stay friends.

46:51.685 --> 46:52.811
– Yup.
– Yeah.

46:57.232 --> 46:59.025
Okay. So, what is your type, anyway?

46:59.192 --> 47:01.194
No, I don't have a type.

47:01.361 --> 47:03.571
– It's more about what's inside.
– Oh, please!

47:03.697 --> 47:05.407
Okay, what about her?

47:05.990 --> 47:08.034
Yeah. I could get to know her inside.

47:08.159 --> 47:09.202
And she's reading a book.

47:10.036 --> 47:11.329
It's probably Nicholas Sparks.

47:11.871 --> 47:13.665
– I'm gonna go talk to her.
– What?

47:14.040 --> 47:15.917
What do you mean, "What?"
We said we wanted to date again.

47:16.042 --> 47:17.711
– I'm gonna go talk to her.
– Now?

47:17.836 --> 47:19.337
Here, in front of all of these people?

47:19.504 --> 47:22.716
I didn't say I was gonna rape her.
I said I was gonna go talk to her.

47:26.594 --> 47:29.389
Excuse me. I'm Dylan. Nice to meet you.

47:29.889 --> 47:31.016
<i>The Notebook.</i>

47:37.439 --> 47:38.565
Nice meeting you.

47:42.277 --> 47:44.821
– Well?
– We talked. We laughed.

47:44.904 --> 47:46.031
Yeah.

47:46.239 --> 47:48.408
– She's Belgian.
– Explains the reading.

47:48.742 --> 47:50.160
I showed her where the balcony was,

47:50.243 --> 47:52.912
because that's where
she is meeting up with her husband.

47:54.914 --> 47:56.082
Anniversary trip to New York.

47:56.374 --> 47:59.377
Three kids. Christof, Karlina and Pepijn.

48:00.503 --> 48:01.546
Shut up.

48:02.589 --> 48:05.425
Why are you still laughing?
At least I gave it a shot.

48:05.675 --> 48:08.261
Fine. I'll go next.

48:08.595 --> 48:10.930
– See if I still have game.
– Okay.

48:11.097 --> 48:12.432
– Okay.
– Okay.

48:12.557 --> 48:14.017
– Yes.
– Right here. Eleven o'clock.

48:14.267 --> 48:16.853
– Iced coffee.
– Handsome, but doesn't know it.

48:17.395 --> 48:20.440
Staring at a tree, which means
he's actually in the park for nature

48:20.523 --> 48:22.108
and not to watch women sunbathe.

48:22.275 --> 48:23.860
– Or he's retarded.
– Don't care.

48:23.943 --> 48:25.069
I'm going in.

48:31.910 --> 48:33.369
– Excuse me.
– Yes?

48:33.870 --> 48:34.954
– Hi.
– Hello.

48:35.455 --> 48:36.748
I'm Jamie.

48:38.374 --> 48:39.626
Yeah. Yeah, that works.

48:41.377 --> 48:42.629
Hi.

48:45.089 --> 48:46.132
Okay.

48:46.299 --> 48:47.383
– Nice to meet you.
– Oh, my God!

48:52.138 --> 48:56.893
Okay. His name is Parker.
He's a children's oncologist.

48:58.144 --> 48:59.813
And I have a date this Saturday.

49:01.147 --> 49:02.315
– Nice.
– Thank you.

49:03.149 --> 49:04.943
Why'd you wave to me?

49:05.485 --> 49:08.404
I told him you were my gay best friend,

49:08.488 --> 49:10.240
so he wants to set you up with his brother.

49:12.992 --> 49:16.788
College, med school,
and I haven't slept since.

49:17.205 --> 49:19.207
I can't believe you actually cure cancer.

49:19.666 --> 49:21.543
Well, me and God.

49:22.377 --> 49:23.837
– What?
– I'm kidding.

49:24.170 --> 49:26.673
Can you imagine
someone who would actually say that?

49:26.798 --> 49:28.842
Yeah, I could.
I've been out with a lot of them.

49:29.050 --> 49:30.677
– Cancer doctors?
– No, assholes.

49:31.344 --> 49:32.387
Yeah.

49:32.512 --> 49:33.680
Well, hopefully you're all done with that.

49:34.848 --> 49:38.351
Although, I gotta warn you,
lot of cancer doctors, big assholes.

49:38.476 --> 49:39.477
– Really?
– Yeah.

49:39.561 --> 49:42.480
And brain surgeons, huge perverts.

49:42.730 --> 49:45.400
While they're doing this, a little bit of that.

49:47.026 --> 49:48.027
Hey.

49:49.404 --> 49:50.697
Thank you.

49:51.489 --> 49:52.574
When can I see you again?

49:56.703 --> 49:57.704
Right now.

49:59.205 --> 50:00.582
– I'm just kidding.
– Okay.

50:00.707 --> 50:02.375
Can you imagine
someone who would actually say that?

50:03.209 --> 50:04.711
<i>I played the tuba in high school.</i>

50:04.919 --> 50:07.046
World's stupidest instrument.

50:07.380 --> 50:09.090
Especially when you move eight times.

50:09.257 --> 50:12.886
– Why'd you move?
– My mom really likes to break up with guys,

50:13.052 --> 50:14.429
and she was really good at it.

50:14.596 --> 50:16.848
– Was your dad one of them?
– No, no, he was long before that.

50:17.265 --> 50:18.558
I actually never knew my dad.

50:18.892 --> 50:20.268
I'm sorry. That sucks.

50:23.229 --> 50:25.565
All right, look,
I think I should probably tell you something.

50:25.732 --> 50:27.192
Please don't tell me you're a dude.

50:27.275 --> 50:29.527
Because that'll be like the third time
since I moved here,

50:29.611 --> 50:31.237
and I don't think I can handle that.

50:31.529 --> 50:32.572
I have a five-date rule.

50:33.406 --> 50:36.075
– You know, like, five dates before we…
– Yeah.

50:36.284 --> 50:38.953
I saw it in a movie. I thought I'd give it a try.

50:40.246 --> 50:41.289
You're worth waiting for.

50:42.415 --> 50:44.250
I'm sure that was the line
in the movie you saw.

50:45.960 --> 50:47.086
<i>That's awesome.</i>

50:47.253 --> 50:50.048
This four-year-old that I've been working on
for the last couple months,

50:50.256 --> 50:51.299
he's gonna be fine.

50:51.591 --> 50:52.759
– That's great.
– Yeah.

50:53.593 --> 50:55.219
How is a guy like you single?

50:55.303 --> 50:58.306
I've just been waiting for someone
to come up to me in the park

50:58.598 --> 51:00.934
and compliment me for looking at the trees
and not the sunbathers.

51:01.059 --> 51:02.435
I meant it. It was impressive.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.562
Actually, if I'm gonna be
completely honest with you,

51:04.646 --> 51:06.356
I was sleeping standing up.

51:06.439 --> 51:09.567
I worked 36 hours straight.
I don't even know how I got to the park.

51:10.485 --> 51:11.819
How is a girl like you single?

51:13.780 --> 51:14.906
I have issues.

51:15.114 --> 51:16.658
One might even call me damaged.

51:16.991 --> 51:18.493
Actually, one did call me damaged.

51:18.618 --> 51:19.744
Get out of here. Damaged how?

51:20.453 --> 51:21.663
I kind of believe in true love.

51:22.330 --> 51:24.916
That there might be
a Prince Charming out there for me.

51:30.255 --> 51:35.218
Listen, I know this is probably a no
because all you do is work like a dull boy,

51:35.301 --> 51:37.637
but would you like to come get a beer?

51:37.762 --> 51:38.763
I'm good.

51:38.846 --> 51:40.598
No, it's not a gay bar.

51:40.682 --> 51:44.644
And there'll be just as many hot girls
as hot guys.

51:46.437 --> 51:49.023
You know what? I will come out.

51:49.190 --> 51:51.943
All right. Let's find you a lady.

51:52.986 --> 51:54.112
You're still not gay, right?

51:54.195 --> 51:55.488
– Nope.
– Okay.

52:01.327 --> 52:02.996
– What?
– Do you know what today is?

52:04.038 --> 52:06.332
– Date number five.
– I wasn't even counting.

52:11.671 --> 52:14.632
– Wanna go in the bedroom?
– No. Here's fine.

52:20.847 --> 52:23.182
I am so glad I met you tonight.

52:23.808 --> 52:25.226
Me, too.

52:29.063 --> 52:31.024
What are you thinking?

52:31.858 --> 52:34.152
Just how great you are.

52:45.747 --> 52:47.165
Annie, hey.

52:47.248 --> 52:49.584
Who the fuck is Annie?

52:49.709 --> 52:50.918
My sister.

52:51.044 --> 52:53.046
Better be. I'll cut her.

52:55.548 --> 52:56.716
Of course I'm coming.

52:57.050 --> 53:01.220
Yeah, I'm taking the 4th off,
so I'll be there for three days.

53:11.898 --> 53:13.524
Yeah. How's Dad?

53:14.025 --> 53:15.401
Any worse?

53:16.194 --> 53:17.862
All right, tell him I said hi.

53:18.738 --> 53:20.239
Bye, Banannie.

53:23.910 --> 53:26.245
I want you to meet my parents.

53:26.871 --> 53:28.790
No, you… Really?

53:36.297 --> 53:37.590
God!

53:55.900 --> 53:57.985
Hey. Hold on, hold on.

53:58.611 --> 54:01.239
No, just hold on. Just give me a second.

54:01.322 --> 54:04.117
I gotta go find a place to talk. Okay.

54:06.410 --> 54:08.454
Shit. Shit. Just hold on.

54:08.579 --> 54:09.747
– Oh, sorry.
– Hold on.

54:09.831 --> 54:11.415
I was out pretty late last night.

54:11.749 --> 54:14.669
When I got in, you and your girlfriend
were on the couch

54:14.794 --> 54:16.337
so I just crashed in your bed.

54:16.462 --> 54:18.131
– He's not a girl.
– He smells like a girl.

54:18.297 --> 54:20.508
– You smelled him?
– I wanna buy marshmallows.

54:20.633 --> 54:23.219
– What did you say?
– For Montauk this weekend.

54:23.302 --> 54:26.097
I wanna do a campfire,
like when you were little.

54:26.180 --> 54:27.265
Okay.

54:27.348 --> 54:30.309
– And then we're gonna look for sticks.
– I hear you. Sticks.

54:30.435 --> 54:33.312
And then we're gonna sing. We're gonna…

54:33.479 --> 54:35.440
Just hold on a second.

54:36.440 --> 54:37.608
Okay.

54:39.694 --> 54:40.862
Okay.

54:45.867 --> 54:47.076
What's up?

54:47.160 --> 54:49.120
Do you think guys care more
about global warming

54:49.203 --> 54:51.622
or how to wear white pants to a cookout?

54:51.706 --> 54:52.832
<i>Well, that depends.</i>

54:52.957 --> 54:55.626
Do you have a hot model in a bikini
standing on an icecap?

54:55.710 --> 54:57.420
No. Ski slope.

54:57.503 --> 54:59.463
I'd still go with pants to a cookout.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.174
Yeah, me, too.

55:01.716 --> 55:04.510
How's your boy Parker? Still staring at trees?

55:04.635 --> 55:06.888
Two coffees.
Yeah, he's still looking up at trees,

55:07.013 --> 55:09.223
but this time it's actually in my apartment.

55:09.348 --> 55:11.726
– It's the fifth date already?
– Maybe. Thank you.

55:11.851 --> 55:14.562
Did you guys "fifth-date"?

55:14.687 --> 55:18.357
– How dare you! A lady never tells.
– I know. That's why I'm asking you.

55:21.903 --> 55:24.739
Hey. I gotta go. You have a great trip in LA
and call me when you land.

55:25.072 --> 55:26.199
Okay.

55:26.324 --> 55:27.742
Parker.

55:28.409 --> 55:29.702
Hey.

55:30.995 --> 55:33.831
I got us coffees.
Nonfat, one sugar, one Splenda.

55:34.415 --> 55:36.042
– I gotta get going.
– What?

55:36.167 --> 55:37.418
I thought you weren't on call today.

55:37.543 --> 55:40.838
I'm not, but I got that thing… I got stuff.

55:40.922 --> 55:42.548
This… They just called me.

55:44.550 --> 55:46.510
– Really?
– Yeah.

55:46.677 --> 55:49.889
The sneak-out. How incredibly cliché of you.

55:50.014 --> 55:51.390
I just…

55:52.266 --> 55:54.268
I don't think I can be your Prince Charming.

55:54.393 --> 55:57.230
God, you totally didn't get
anything that I was saying, did you?

55:57.355 --> 56:00.691
– No, no, no. I think you're great.
– Yeah, you, too.

56:01.025 --> 56:02.693
Hey, you know what?
You and I should stay friends.

56:02.777 --> 56:04.779
– Really?
– No, go fuck yourself.

56:15.748 --> 56:17.083
<i>Who sleeps standing up?</i>

56:17.583 --> 56:18.751
You know, you'd be really proud of me.

56:18.876 --> 56:20.836
I didn't even blink
when I told him to go fuck himself.

56:20.920 --> 56:24.590
– You did just then, though.
– This does not count. I'm not in the moment.

56:25.216 --> 56:26.884
I don't know, maybe I suck in bed.

56:26.968 --> 56:28.302
Trust me, you don't suck in bed.

56:29.095 --> 56:30.930
– Thank you.
– So needy.

56:31.055 --> 56:32.682
Hey, maybe the guy's married or something.

56:32.765 --> 56:34.600
No, did a background check at work.

56:34.725 --> 56:37.812
Single, no criminal history, credit report 720.

56:37.937 --> 56:39.522
Background check. Did you do one on me?

56:39.605 --> 56:41.816
How could you possibly
max out an Old Navy card?

56:41.941 --> 56:44.110
After college I was really into cargo pants.

56:45.820 --> 56:47.655
Dylan, I gotta stop thinking it's not me.

56:47.780 --> 56:50.032
– I mean, it's gotta be me.
– It's not you.

56:50.116 --> 56:51.367
Nothing is wrong with you.

56:51.450 --> 56:53.452
He's a guy.
You gave him a five-date challenge,

56:53.577 --> 56:55.955
he got you and cut out. Forget the douche.

56:56.080 --> 56:58.499
He's a dick. He's a dick-douche.

56:59.667 --> 57:01.168
Go have fun with your mom.

57:01.669 --> 57:04.839
– Okay.
– Almost forgot. I got you something.

57:12.471 --> 57:15.141
It's Lieutenant Kali,
the street artist we talked about.

57:15.308 --> 57:17.810
I got him to do something for you.
"F-tale." Fairytale.

57:18.477 --> 57:21.647
– I know you're into that girly shit, so…
– This is so cool.

57:22.773 --> 57:24.734
Dylan, that's actually really sweet.

57:24.817 --> 57:26.819
– It's cool, right?
– Yeah. Thank you.

57:28.654 --> 57:30.323
Hey, I'm gonna need to borrow cab fare.

57:31.490 --> 57:33.659
I'm not taking that thing on the subway.
I don't wanna get rolled.

57:33.784 --> 57:34.869
No problem.

57:34.994 --> 57:36.996
As long as you get your feet off my bed.
They're disgusting.

57:39.290 --> 57:40.374
What are you doing?

57:40.499 --> 57:41.792
Why are you doing that?
Why are you doing that?

57:42.335 --> 57:44.211
You're an animal. Stop doing that.
An animal. Stop.

57:48.341 --> 57:49.800
Hey, Ma.

57:51.135 --> 57:53.554
Ma. Come on, we gotta get on the road.

57:54.013 --> 57:55.348
Come on.

57:55.473 --> 57:56.891
Ma?

58:15.534 --> 58:17.411
Why did I think that
this time would be any different?

58:17.536 --> 58:19.163
– Come with me to LA.
<i>– What?</i>

58:19.246 --> 58:21.957
What else are you gonna do?
It's 4th of July, everybody's left the city.

58:22.041 --> 58:23.793
You're very sweet for asking, but it's fine.

58:23.876 --> 58:25.544
You know what, I'll just stay here.
I'll be fine alone.

58:25.669 --> 58:27.880
I know you'll be fine alone.
You're not a baby in a hot car.

58:28.881 --> 58:30.716
I'm actually asking you to come
because it would help me.

58:31.050 --> 58:32.760
<i>You'd be a great distraction for my family.</i>

58:32.885 --> 58:35.054
They'd forget all about
drilling me for being single.

58:35.221 --> 58:36.389
Won't they think that we're together?

58:36.514 --> 58:38.557
– Not if I tell them we're not.
– And they'll believe you?

58:38.683 --> 58:41.060
Yeah, we're one of these crazy families
that doesn't lie to each other.

58:41.185 --> 58:42.520
PBS is doing a documentary on us.

58:42.728 --> 58:43.771
<i>Come on, they'll love you.</i>

58:43.896 --> 58:46.357
All fast-talking and brusque,
like I'm bringing home a carny.

58:46.440 --> 58:49.527
You're really nice to ask,
but I'm just gonna stay here.

58:49.610 --> 58:50.861
Go to the gym.

58:51.112 --> 58:54.031
I just got you a ticket with my miles,
it's done. Meet me at JFK.

58:54.115 --> 58:55.533
– But…
– No buts.

58:55.616 --> 58:58.452
– Like you were gonna go to the gym.
– I wasn't.

59:11.924 --> 59:13.551
LA's so nice.

59:14.135 --> 59:15.970
And everyone's so genuine and level-headed.

59:17.596 --> 59:20.599
Thanks for this. You're good peeps.

59:20.766 --> 59:22.393
You're the good peeps, dude.

59:22.476 --> 59:25.104
You haven't met my family.
You don't know what you're in for.

59:26.897 --> 59:28.065
Okay.

59:28.315 --> 59:30.151
You know these planes
pretty much land themselves?

59:30.276 --> 59:33.154
Nobody cares. You sound like an asshole.

59:34.613 --> 59:35.990
She's from New York.

59:36.115 --> 59:37.450
I'm sorry.

59:48.127 --> 59:50.421
Wow. This looks normal.

59:50.504 --> 59:51.755
It is.

59:52.631 --> 59:53.758
Thank you.

59:57.970 --> 59:59.847
Wow, you grew up here?

01:00:00.473 --> 01:00:02.475
It was my grandfather's.

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:04.268
He bought it
when there was nothing else here.

01:00:04.435 --> 01:00:06.645
My dad and my sister
and her son live here now.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:09.982
Why would you move to New York?

01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:11.650
I was conned by some headhunter.

01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:14.320
– You're here.
– Sammy!

01:00:14.487 --> 01:00:15.488
Hey, Uncle Dylan.

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:16.864
What's up, buddy?

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:18.908
How are you?

01:00:18.991 --> 01:00:21.702
Jamie, this is my nephew,
Sam the Magnificent.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:24.580
– Hello.
– May I offer you a light for your cigarette?

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:26.332
I'm sorry, I don't smoke.

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:28.250
Just pretend. He's a magician.

01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:31.212
Of course I'll have a cigarette.
Smoking is great for you.

01:00:34.507 --> 01:00:38.886
– Wow. Thank you, good sir.
– My pleasure, my lady.

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.138
Oh, my God. I got it, I got it.

01:00:41.222 --> 01:00:43.390
Sammy. I got it, I got it.
Just stay still. I got it, I got it.

01:00:43.516 --> 01:00:45.142
Sammy! Are you okay?

01:00:45.226 --> 01:00:46.477
All part of the illusion.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.187
– Jet Skis later?
– Definitely.

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:50.439
Still into magic, huh?

01:00:50.523 --> 01:00:53.692
Yep. But I'll take that over him
sexting his friends any day.

01:00:54.527 --> 01:00:56.737
– Dilbert!
– Banannie.

01:00:58.072 --> 01:01:00.574
Jamie, this is my sister, Annie.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.117
– Hi.
– Thank you for having me.

01:01:02.201 --> 01:01:04.161
Oh, please.
It's nice to have Dylan bring a girl home.

01:01:04.245 --> 01:01:05.830
– We're just friends.
– Oh, no, I know.

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:08.082
If you were his girlfriend,
he never would've brought you here.

01:01:08.207 --> 01:01:10.876
– This one has intimacy issues.
– I know.

01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:12.086
– Dylan.
– Dad.

01:01:12.211 --> 01:01:13.837
– Dylan. Oh, man.
– Hey.

01:01:13.921 --> 01:01:16.298
– How you doing, buddy?
– I'm good.

01:01:16.382 --> 01:01:18.342
I miss you guys, but I'm good.

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:20.761
Dede Spencer?

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.097
Jamie. Dylan's friend.

01:01:25.266 --> 01:01:27.017
– I'm sorry. I…
– That's okay.

01:01:27.101 --> 01:01:29.061
No, for a minute you reminded me
of a girl I used to know.

01:01:29.228 --> 01:01:31.564
– No, that's okay. It happens.
– Nice to meet you.

01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:33.774
Pleasure meeting you.
You have a beautiful house.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:34.900
Thank you.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:38.362
Pool's a little cold,
but it's very expensive to heat, so…

01:01:39.405 --> 01:01:41.407
I think I'm gonna go in
and check the tide tables

01:01:41.532 --> 01:01:43.117
'cause I'm gonna take the boat out
early in the morning.

01:01:43.242 --> 01:01:44.743
– You should come.
– I would love to.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.453
We sold the boat.

01:01:46.579 --> 01:01:48.581
The doctor doesn't want you
driving the boat anymore.

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:52.751
– Turning to mush.
– No.

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:56.589
It's good to see you, buddy.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:58.382
– Nice to meet you.
– It was nice meeting you, too.

01:01:58.465 --> 01:02:00.217
– Jamie. See?
– Yes.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:08.058
– What's with the pants?
– He doesn't like them anymore.

01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:10.102
He's getting worse.

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:12.229
It's so good to have you here.

01:02:13.439 --> 01:02:14.481
Go show her the beach.

01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:17.985
– Let me show you the beach. Come on.
– Okay.

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.946
– Go, get sandy. Get all messed up.
– Okay.

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:38.547
Dylan never told me about your dad.

01:02:38.631 --> 01:02:41.342
Yeah, it's been tough on him.
They were real close.

01:02:42.009 --> 01:02:43.886
Dylan doesn't quite know
how to deal with the Alzheimer's.

01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:45.179
I'm sorry.

01:02:45.304 --> 01:02:47.890
He'll be his regular old self
and everything seems fine,

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:50.643
and then just in a flash, he's gone.

01:02:52.603 --> 01:02:55.105
– That's Dylan when he was nine.
– Are those braids?

01:02:55.356 --> 01:02:57.983
He was going through a Kris Kross phase.
Remember them?

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:06.200
– Is that your mom?
– No, that's Dylan's speech therapist.

01:03:07.326 --> 01:03:10.287
He had a stutter.
It got real bad when he was nervous.

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:11.997
He had a rough childhood.

01:03:12.164 --> 01:03:15.167
– His math tutor called it "character-building."
– Math tutor?

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:19.129
No, we're talking, like, 8 times 6 equals 1,200.

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:21.298
But he's very visual, thank God.

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:26.053
– Can you please explain to me this photo?
– That is my 12th-birthday surprise party.

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:28.222
– Hey.
– Amazing moment.

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:30.057
I'm exhausted. I'm gonna go to bed.

01:03:30.182 --> 01:03:33.227
– Jamie, you all good with your room?
– Yeah. No, it's perfect.

01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:35.396
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:43.404
Sammy and I built a saw-a-girl-in-half box,
so just be careful on your way to bed.

01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:46.657
– He's not using a real saw, is he?
– Of course he is. He's magnificent.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:50.536
I'll make sure he brushes his teeth,
and you, don't believe anything she says.

01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:52.162
She's a liar.

01:03:53.205 --> 01:03:55.666
– He's a pretty special guy.
– Yeah, I think so.

01:03:58.419 --> 01:04:00.379
– Jamie. Hey.
– Hey.

01:04:00.713 --> 01:04:01.880
– You up?
– Yeah. Come in.

01:04:04.842 --> 01:04:06.635
– I thought you were going to bed.
– I was.

01:04:06.719 --> 01:04:09.388
But then I realised
we were both single again, so…

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.727
– Dude, no.
– Why not?

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:16.729
I washed my hands. With soap this time.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:18.772
Are you serious?
Why would you just assume?

01:04:18.939 --> 01:04:22.609
You cracked your neck on the porch.
This thing. That's your tell, remember?

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:26.071
I cracked my neck
because we were on a flight for six hours,

01:04:26.739 --> 01:04:29.616
and you were yapping my ear off
about how planes all fly themselves,

01:04:29.742 --> 01:04:31.243
and it actually kinked my neck a bit.

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:34.079
– So, no?
– No. Not having sex with you.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:36.457
Is it your special time?
They have an app for that. No, wait.

01:04:39.418 --> 01:04:41.378
– Nope, you're good to go.
– We talked about this.

01:04:41.462 --> 01:04:44.131
– Plus, I just got dumped, so…
– Okay, I'm sorry.

01:04:44.256 --> 01:04:46.550
I thought this would be a good way
to take your mind off him.

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:48.761
No, I don't function that way.
Sex is not gonna help.

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:51.346
But you know what will? Emotional support.

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:54.308
Before we were sex without emotion,
and now we're emotion without sex.

01:04:54.433 --> 01:04:55.851
Exactly.

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:57.770
I just need you to be my friend right now.

01:04:57.895 --> 01:04:59.938
Okay. So I'll listen to you
while you give me a hand job.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:02.566
– No.
– I'm kidding. I got it. Good night.

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:06.820
Wait, hold on! Friends can still hang out
and, I don't know, listen to music.

01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:08.113
Listen to music?

01:05:10.157 --> 01:05:11.283
I'm gonna kill Annie.

01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:15.120
– I can't believe you used to like them.
– I didn't like these guys.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:16.288
I don't even remember…

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:31.303
And then there's something,
I don't know what he says right there…

01:05:33.806 --> 01:05:36.350
Are you kidding me?
These dudes were da bomb.

01:05:36.475 --> 01:05:38.352
Everybody had Girbauds,
we all wore them backwards.

01:05:38.477 --> 01:05:39.478
The baseball jerseys.

01:05:41.313 --> 01:05:43.315
I went as Kris Kross
three years in a row for Halloween.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.609
– Oh, you poor kid.
– I'm not proud of it.

01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:49.488
Hey, I borrowed one of your books.
I hope that's okay.

01:05:53.033 --> 01:05:54.326
Like this.

01:05:56.787 --> 01:05:57.830
No.

01:06:06.547 --> 01:06:07.673
Surprise!

01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:14.680
Have you really never brought
a girl home before?

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:16.682
I brought you here.

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:19.977
I mean like a real girl. Not a friend.

01:06:20.853 --> 01:06:22.855
– A real girl?
– Yeah.

01:06:24.148 --> 01:06:25.566
I guess not.

01:06:25.691 --> 01:06:28.360
– Separation of church and state.
– Ah, yes.

01:06:28.527 --> 01:06:32.030
Build up as many walls as possible.
That's really healthy.

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:34.241
– What, are you talking to me about walls?
– Yeah.

01:06:34.366 --> 01:06:36.577
What about you and your mom?

01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:39.705
You couldn't get me out of there fast enough
when she walked in on us.

01:06:39.872 --> 01:06:41.999
That was for your own protection. Okay?

01:06:42.082 --> 01:06:45.919
I'm just surprised she didn't try
to slip you her number or something.

01:06:46.044 --> 01:06:48.213
She did. She put it in my phone.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:50.424
– Under "MILF."
– Oh, my God.

01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:53.218
It's cool, we only hooked up, like, twice.

01:06:54.845 --> 01:06:57.139
I'm starting to get a mental image.

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:58.473
Well, I have a video image.

01:06:58.557 --> 01:07:01.727
No. Just stop it. Just stop it.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:06.398
Just wrong.

01:07:09.735 --> 01:07:10.903
What?

01:07:12.446 --> 01:07:14.740
Nothing. Just glad I met you.

01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:20.245
Yeah, well, knowing you doesn't suck either.

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:41.266
– But I thought you said…
– I know what I said.

01:09:18.447 --> 01:09:19.531
God.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.600
Lasorda was a good pitcher,
but he was an even better manager.

01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:49.185
– Wrecking Crew?
– I wasn't saying he's not a great manager.

01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:51.020
He's underappreciated as a pitcher,
that's all I'm saying.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:52.439
We get it. Guys.

01:09:52.564 --> 01:09:53.648
– Hi.
– Morning.

01:09:53.732 --> 01:09:57.235
– Good morning.
– Is it always this beautiful out here?

01:09:57.736 --> 01:10:00.614
Well, in between the fires and the floods,
we get about 10 good days.

01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:03.492
No, no. Here. You two sit together.

01:10:03.575 --> 01:10:04.951
– Are you sure?
– Oh, yeah, no, no.

01:10:05.077 --> 01:10:07.746
– You don't have to do that, Dad.
– I know. I wanna look at the boat.

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:09.581
I love that boat.

01:10:09.915 --> 01:10:11.750
– Here. Sorry.
– Great. Thanks.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.293
Here.

01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:16.797
Thank you. This… Okay.

01:10:18.423 --> 01:10:20.509
– Coffee, my lady?
– Yes, please.

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:22.928
Thank you.

01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:27.182
– All right, man!
– Look at you!

01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:30.560
– That's pretty impressive.
– Yay, Sammy!

01:10:30.644 --> 01:10:32.312
All right!

01:10:32.646 --> 01:10:36.441
Oh, buddy. Your shirt's leaking.
Oh, no, that's…

01:10:36.525 --> 01:10:37.651
Apologies.

01:10:42.364 --> 01:10:43.532
Here.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.788
– You okay?
– Yeah.

01:10:50.705 --> 01:10:52.124
– You?
– Yeah.

01:11:04.553 --> 01:11:06.805
– See them, Sammy?
– Yeah.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.642
– Pretty cool, huh?
– Yeah.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.395
God, it's nice.

01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:17.732
I do miss the mornings out here.
Right before it burns off, it really is beautiful.

01:11:17.983 --> 01:11:19.192
I like Jamie.

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:23.655
And she's pretty, too.

01:11:23.822 --> 01:11:26.491
Hey, easy, dude.
Don't you go casting a spell on her.

01:11:26.825 --> 01:11:30.495
I'm a magician, not a wizard.
You and your gay Harry Potter.

01:11:30.996 --> 01:11:33.540
You can't deny that going to Hogwarts
wouldn't be life-changing.

01:11:34.666 --> 01:11:37.169
– I miss you.
– I miss you, too, bud.

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:41.006
Mom misses you. And so does Grandpa.

01:11:43.008 --> 01:11:44.176
Does he say anything?

01:11:44.509 --> 01:11:47.345
No. But sometimes he calls me Dylan.

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:51.850
He said that he didn't want the job.

01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:54.686
That he was just coming to New York
to explore his options.

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:56.104
What a crock of gas.

01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:59.191
You fly across the country
to explore your options?

01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:00.692
Please. I don't think so.

01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:04.404
Exactly! Please, I knew I had him
the second he got off that plane.

01:12:04.571 --> 01:12:05.780
– Oh, did you, now?
– Yeah.

01:12:05.864 --> 01:12:08.450
Was that the same second you leapt
onto the baggage carousel barefoot

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:09.868
and acted out a scene from <i>Will and Grace</i> ?

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:12.412
– She did?
– Oh, yeah, you should have seen her.

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:13.872
"Look at me, I'm goofy but cute."

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:15.498
You know what? It was all part of my plan.

01:12:15.582 --> 01:12:16.750
Quite a plan.

01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:18.335
Did you major in Planning
at Headhunting College?

01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:20.754
– So clever.
– It's not a real college, by the way, buddy.

01:12:20.879 --> 01:12:23.924
You guys bicker like
you're an old married couple.

01:12:24.216 --> 01:12:25.509
Here, pick a card, my lady.

01:12:25.592 --> 01:12:26.760
Okay.

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:28.845
Oh, no, not that one. The one on top.

01:12:28.929 --> 01:12:31.097
– This is a good one.
– So…

01:12:31.223 --> 01:12:32.390
– Yeah?
– Shuffle.

01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:34.476
Did you get her an engagement gift?

01:12:34.893 --> 01:12:37.479
We're not engaged, Dad. We're not together.
We're just friends.

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:41.733
All right, you don't wanna label it.
I understand. But get her some jewellery.

01:12:42.734 --> 01:12:44.110
The only thing your mom loves is jewellery.

01:12:44.236 --> 01:12:47.739
I don't care how upset she is,
I get her jewellery, she lights right up.

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:49.282
Where is she, anyway?

01:12:50.617 --> 01:12:53.787
– She's not here, Dad.
– I know, that's why I asked. Where is she?

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:58.291
– She's not coming.
– Why not?

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:01.586
She doesn't live with you anymore, Pop.
You're not married.

01:13:02.337 --> 01:13:04.965
– What?
– She left about 10 years ago.

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.174
I don't understand.

01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:08.468
She divorced you, Dad.

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:12.931
– I have to call her.
– Dad, you can't.

01:13:13.014 --> 01:13:14.432
Stop telling me what to do.

01:13:15.809 --> 01:13:17.269
Get your…

01:13:20.939 --> 01:13:22.190
Grandpa!

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.733
Dylan, get…

01:13:23.817 --> 01:13:25.193
– You okay, Dad?
– I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:13:25.277 --> 01:13:27.696
– Here, let me help you up.
– No, don't. Don't!

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.479
Here we are.

01:14:02.564 --> 01:14:04.858
This is beautiful.

01:14:04.983 --> 01:14:07.736
Yeah, this is where I used to come to think.
My rooftop.

01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:09.321
Okay, how high do you think that fence is?

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:10.989
I'm a little over 6 foot.

01:14:11.156 --> 01:14:14.409
Looks like it's about three of me.
So six times three…

01:14:15.493 --> 01:14:17.162
Ninety-two feet.

01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:21.041
– Ninety-two feet. That's really tall, right?
– Yeah.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.503
But they don't want you to get up there,
so I guess that makes sense.

01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:29.341
– Wait. Six times three…
– Oh, God, you poor kid.

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:32.052
– What's up?
– Come on.

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:34.054
What? What? Where are you going?

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:37.390
Jamie, no, no, no, no, no, wait.
They take this shit seriously, okay?

01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:38.516
Look at all the cameras.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.978
This is the only landmark this city has
other than the Scientology Centre.

01:14:42.062 --> 01:14:45.148
And if any of these cameras are hooked up
to the actual Scientology Centre,

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:47.108
that was an inappropriate joke
and I apologise.

01:14:47.192 --> 01:14:49.778
I believe in the freedom of science fiction.

01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:52.947
Pussy! Oh, sorry.

01:14:53.031 --> 01:14:54.074
Pussy!

01:14:54.449 --> 01:14:55.533
Come on!

01:15:01.873 --> 01:15:04.668
– You really never been up here before?
– No.

01:15:04.751 --> 01:15:07.212
I've also never transferred
heroin in my rectum,

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:09.089
'cause it's against the law.

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:13.218
You know, sometimes a simple
yes or no answer is adequate.

01:15:13.385 --> 01:15:15.053
Hey, why didn't you tell me about your mom?

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.555
She's not worth talking about.

01:15:18.223 --> 01:15:19.224
That's rough.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:20.934
So is leaving your husband and kids.

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.104
Yeah, you never told me about him either.

01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:26.147
You know, there's a lot of stuff
you didn't tell me.

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:27.816
I don't want your pity.

01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:33.071
I can handle anything except
that look in people's eyes.

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:38.410
– That one.
– Who cares what anybody thinks?

01:15:38.952 --> 01:15:42.288
He's the smartest man I've ever known.
He's the only person I'd ever go to for advice.

01:15:42.414 --> 01:15:43.665
He's my dad.

01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:45.208
Dylan, he's still the same man.

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:46.626
When I see the way people look at him now…

01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:49.921
It doesn't matter how people look at him.

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:51.256
All that matters is how you look at him.

01:15:51.339 --> 01:15:54.175
Yeah, but he's walking around
without his pants. Everyone's staring.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.885
– So what?
– It's embarrassing.

01:15:55.969 --> 01:15:57.637
He needs to know that nothing has changed.

01:15:57.762 --> 01:15:59.639
That he's still that same man to you.

01:15:59.764 --> 01:16:01.766
Can we stop talking about this?

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:06.563
Yeah, that's really smart.
Let's just not talk about our feelings.

01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:07.772
I'm trying not to.

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:12.861
Come on. Is something going on here?
You've been acting really weird.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:14.946
– No, I haven't.
– Yeah, you have.

01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:16.823
Is this about what happened the other night?

01:16:16.948 --> 01:16:19.033
What, sex? That doesn't mean anything.
You know that.

01:16:22.287 --> 01:16:23.329
Right.

01:16:23.455 --> 01:16:25.623
– And I haven't been acting weird.
– Okay.

01:16:27.292 --> 01:16:29.669
– Oh, my God!
– Oh, shit!

01:16:29.836 --> 01:16:31.754
– I told you!
– Well, I'm sorry!

01:16:31.838 --> 01:16:32.881
Fuck!

01:16:32.964 --> 01:16:36.050
<i>This is the LAPD. You are trespassing.
Get down from the sign.</i>

01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:37.302
We gotta jump.

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:41.639
– Dylan, jump!
– I'm frozen.

01:16:41.723 --> 01:16:42.807
Come on, get down!

01:16:42.891 --> 01:16:44.017
<i>Sir, this is your last warning.</i>

01:16:44.142 --> 01:16:46.311
– Use the ladder!
– I have a fear of heights!

01:16:46.561 --> 01:16:51.316
And also helicopters!
They don't make sense to me!

01:16:51.399 --> 01:16:53.735
What do you mean
you have a fear of heights?

01:16:54.194 --> 01:16:55.612
Why would you come up here?

01:16:55.695 --> 01:16:58.239
You called me a pussy!

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:02.911
<i>A bizarre situation
this afternoon in the Southland.</i>

01:17:02.994 --> 01:17:06.539
<i>The LAPD rescued a local man
from the Hollywood sign,</i>

01:17:06.998 --> 01:17:08.708
<i>the city's only real landmark.</i>

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:11.002
They actually wrapped you in a foil blanket!

01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:12.754
Did you run a marathon before this?

01:17:12.837 --> 01:17:14.380
– Okay. Give me…
– No!

01:17:14.506 --> 01:17:16.758
– No, no. I wanna save it. I gotta save it.
– No. That's enough!

01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:19.093
– Give me the remote! Shut up!
– No, I wanna watch it over and over.

01:17:19.177 --> 01:17:20.762
Foil wrapper…

01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:22.055
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:17:23.014 --> 01:17:24.766
It's okay, it'll be up on YouTube.

01:17:26.059 --> 01:17:29.771
Hey, you're still good to take Dad that week
I have to go to DC for Sam's class trip, right?

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:33.024
– Yeah, he's gonna stay with me in New York.
– Oh, good.

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:36.110
So, when are we gonna see Jamie again?

01:17:36.194 --> 01:17:37.654
I don't know.

01:17:37.737 --> 01:17:40.114
What's your problem?
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?

01:17:40.198 --> 01:17:42.242
She's not my girlfriend.
Why don't you believe me?

01:17:42.367 --> 01:17:44.702
I would believe you if you didn't lie to me.

01:17:44.786 --> 01:17:46.830
I saw you creeping out of her room
the other night.

01:17:46.913 --> 01:17:48.957
Like you had just had sex,
if you know what I mean.

01:17:49.207 --> 01:17:50.959
Yes, I know what you mean, you just said it.

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:53.253
And how do you know
what I look like after I have…

01:17:53.378 --> 01:17:56.589
I'm not talking to you about this, okay?
We're not together.

01:17:57.048 --> 01:17:59.259
– Dylan.
– Enough! I'm not talking about it.

01:17:59.467 --> 01:18:00.718
Dylan.

01:18:02.554 --> 01:18:03.972
Forgot my saw. I'll be right back.

01:18:06.558 --> 01:18:09.102
I'll wait here. Don't worry about me.

01:18:09.227 --> 01:18:12.397
Friends who have sex?
What are you, in college?

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.440
– It doesn't matter, it's over.
– Why?

01:18:14.566 --> 01:18:16.234
Because we don't like each other like that.

01:18:16.317 --> 01:18:19.279
Okay, you know what?
Can we just talk about this? Sit down.

01:18:19.571 --> 01:18:20.989
What more are you looking for?

01:18:21.072 --> 01:18:23.074
– Who says I'm looking for anything?
– Dylan.

01:18:23.241 --> 01:18:26.411
– I don't know, but it's not Jamie.
– Why, because you're great together?

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:28.329
Because you're actually
friends with each other?

01:18:28.413 --> 01:18:30.873
Because this is the happiest
I have ever seen you?

01:18:30.957 --> 01:18:33.835
I don't know what to tell you.
She's not for me. I don't like her like that.

01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:37.422
– You liked her enough to have sex with her.
– It's just physical.

01:18:37.505 --> 01:18:40.383
– Like playing tennis.
– I don't even know what that means, Dylan.

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:43.011
I haven't seen you this dumb
since you got that candy corn tattoo.

01:18:43.136 --> 01:18:45.430
It's a lightning bolt! With extra powers!

01:18:45.513 --> 01:18:47.599
Dylan, you can't name
one thing that's wrong with her.

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:50.894
I can never go out with her.
She's too fucked up.

01:18:50.977 --> 01:18:52.896
Okay, she doesn't want a boyfriend.

01:18:52.979 --> 01:18:54.147
She's too damaged.

01:18:54.272 --> 01:18:56.316
Magnum P.I. couldn't solve
the shit going on in her head.

01:18:56.441 --> 01:18:58.651
Wow. You'll say anything right now

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:00.320
not to admit that
you're perfect for each other.

01:19:00.445 --> 01:19:02.322
– Why am I still having this conversation?
– Because I'm right.

01:19:02.447 --> 01:19:04.115
– Good talk, Annie.
– Dylan.

01:19:24.344 --> 01:19:26.387
I don't think the three-point line
would have done anything.

01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:28.264
– He was taller than anyone alive.
– No, but it helped Kobe.

01:19:28.348 --> 01:19:29.807
– Kobe Bryant is incredible.
– It helped him.

01:19:29.891 --> 01:19:33.269
– You're men. You like sports. You're men.
– Scored 81 points. Please.

01:19:33.353 --> 01:19:35.229
Hey! We were waiting for you.

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:36.939
I actually got a call from work.

01:19:37.023 --> 01:19:38.733
I have to be on a red eye tonight
back to New York.

01:19:39.067 --> 01:19:40.485
– Tonight?
– Yeah.

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:42.820
– Tomorrow's the 4th.
– I know, it sucks.

01:19:43.071 --> 01:19:44.364
Well, at least let me drive you to the airport.

01:19:44.489 --> 01:19:47.492
No, no. It's fine. Stay.
I already called a cab. It's out front.

01:19:47.575 --> 01:19:49.619
But thank you guys for everything.

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:52.497
And thank you for letting me stay here.
It's been pretty great.

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:56.918
– Hey.
– Hey.

01:19:57.001 --> 01:19:59.921
– Everything okay, buddy?
– Yeah, buddy. Everything's great.

01:20:00.004 --> 01:20:01.339
I just really gotta go.

01:20:01.673 --> 01:20:05.301
So, thank you again. I'm sorry I gotta go.

01:20:05.385 --> 01:20:07.095
– Let Dylan drive you.
– Yeah.

01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:10.014
– Do you wanna take some food to go?
– Do you want me to saw you in half?

01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:13.434
You can send your bottom part to New York
and your top half can stay here.

01:20:14.894 --> 01:20:17.897
Or the whole of you could stay.

01:20:18.022 --> 01:20:19.732
Okay, I'm sorry. I gotta go.

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.538
Jamie!

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:43.589
She's gone. She hopped in the cab.

01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:53.266
– We should eat. You hungry, buddy?
– Yeah.

01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:56.060
Okay. Hand me your plate.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:29.177
Hey, bro. You hungry?
'Cause I'm going to get something to eat.

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:32.263
Thanks, man.
I think I'm just gonna work through lunch.

01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:37.518
A work ethic. I love it.
That is why this country is still number one.

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:41.856
Well, behind Germany and France
and Belgium and Japan and China and…

01:21:42.273 --> 01:21:44.525
Thank God for Bangladesh.

01:21:45.276 --> 01:21:48.780
By the way, why did you take
your door off its lovely hinges?

01:21:48.863 --> 01:21:51.282
It was dumb, man.
Something I saw in a management book.

01:21:51.449 --> 01:21:55.203
Oh, right, right.
Like, that's how Warren Buffett got rich.

01:21:55.286 --> 01:21:57.038
He took doors off of things.

01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:59.123
Hey, everybody wants a shortcut in life.

01:21:59.207 --> 01:22:02.043
My guidebook is very simple.
You wanna lose weight?

01:22:02.210 --> 01:22:03.377
Stop eating, fatty.

01:22:03.503 --> 01:22:04.629
You wanna make money?

01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:06.714
Work your ass off, lazy.

01:22:06.798 --> 01:22:07.924
You wanna be happy?

01:22:08.007 --> 01:22:10.218
Find someone you like and never let him go.

01:22:10.468 --> 01:22:13.471
Or her, if you're into that kind of creepy shit.

01:22:26.317 --> 01:22:28.820
<i>Hi, you've reached Jamie Rellis.
I can't pick up the phone right now,</i>

01:22:28.903 --> 01:22:31.489
<i>but please leave a message
and I'll call you back.</i>

01:22:38.663 --> 01:22:41.666
Mom, Mom, you gotta point it at the screen.
You gotta tell it where you are.

01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:45.711
Fine. I'm over here pouring myself a drink.

01:22:49.757 --> 01:22:53.177
Booty call.
I can take a walk around the block.

01:22:53.261 --> 01:22:55.847
No, no. Nope, that's okay.

01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:57.682
This is your apartment.
I don't wanna twat-block you.

01:23:00.685 --> 01:23:02.520
That's Dylan, right?

01:23:02.687 --> 01:23:04.480
– He seemed pretty great.
– You met him once.

01:23:04.564 --> 01:23:06.399
Well, that's more than
anybody else you've dated.

01:23:06.691 --> 01:23:09.694
I don't know, you think maybe I keep
my worlds apart for some crazy reason?

01:23:20.872 --> 01:23:23.374
I am an asshole.

01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:27.128
<i>We're looking for someone
to lead the redesign of our entire website.</i>

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:28.963
<i>Someone to turn it completely upside down.</i>

01:23:29.046 --> 01:23:30.798
But you can't tell me
what company you work for?

01:23:30.882 --> 01:23:33.426
<i>For confidentiality reasons, no.</i>

01:23:33.551 --> 01:23:34.760
Can you give me a hint?

01:23:34.886 --> 01:23:38.890
<i>We may or may not be the largest seller
of purchased goods on the Internet.</i>

01:23:38.973 --> 01:23:41.309
<i>And by "purchased goods," I mean books.</i>

01:23:41.726 --> 01:23:44.312
<i>You just placed the new art director
over at </i> GQ <i>, right?</i>

01:23:44.395 --> 01:23:45.438
Yeah.

01:23:45.563 --> 01:23:48.441
<i>That's the type of guy we want.
Shoot, that's the guy we want.</i>

01:23:48.566 --> 01:23:49.567
<i>Can you get him to come out to us?</i>

01:23:50.401 --> 01:23:52.987
No longer have a relationship with him.

01:23:53.112 --> 01:23:55.948
<i>– Can you get to him?</i>
– He's still in the first year of his contract,

01:23:56.073 --> 01:23:58.492
so that would be inappropriate.

01:23:58.576 --> 01:24:00.661
<i>So is paying full price
for a book at Barnes & Noble,</i>

01:24:00.745 --> 01:24:01.913
<i>but people do dumb shit.</i>

01:24:05.583 --> 01:24:08.085
<i>Hi, you've reached Jamie Rellis.
I can't pick up the phone right now,</i>

01:24:08.169 --> 01:24:10.254
<i>but please leave a message
and I'll call you back.</i>

01:24:10.421 --> 01:24:13.424
Wow, right to voice mail. Didn't even ring.

01:24:25.686 --> 01:24:26.938
Jamie.

01:24:28.856 --> 01:24:31.150
How'd you know I was up here?

01:24:32.443 --> 01:24:34.278
Only place in the city
you don't get reception.

01:24:34.362 --> 01:24:35.613
Right.

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:37.865
– Why are you avoiding me?
– I'm not.

01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:40.117
Really? Come on, Jamie.

01:24:40.284 --> 01:24:44.288
Well, Dylan, I don't know if you've heard,
but I am seriously fucked up.

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:48.960
I mean, Magnum P.I. couldn't solve
the shit going on up here.

01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:52.255
– Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
– But I'm just gonna go

01:24:52.338 --> 01:24:55.633
and try to fix the shit going on up
in my head, if that's even possible.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:25:00.012
I shouldn't have said that.
I was just trying to get my sister off my back.

01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:02.348
– She thought we liked each other.
– Yeah, me, too, Dylan.

01:25:02.473 --> 01:25:03.474
I thought we were friends.

01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:06.143
But friends don't go
talking shit about each other,

01:25:06.227 --> 01:25:09.605
which must mean that you and I
were actually never friends.

01:25:09.689 --> 01:25:13.109
– That all you wanted was to get in my pants.
– What?

01:25:13.192 --> 01:25:15.403
You jumped at the chance
at your dad's house.

01:25:15.486 --> 01:25:16.570
You cracked your neck.

01:25:16.654 --> 01:25:18.781
I thought you were giving me a sign.
We talked about this.

01:25:18.864 --> 01:25:20.199
Oh, my God, really?

01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:22.576
You pulled my robe off.
"Oopsy." Remember?

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.870
Yeah. And then you snuck out of the room.

01:25:24.996 --> 01:25:26.163
"Oopsy." Remember that?

01:25:27.164 --> 01:25:30.167
Are you pissed off at me
because I didn't cuddle?

01:25:32.003 --> 01:25:36.090
Isn't that why we started
this whole arrangement in the first place?

01:25:36.257 --> 01:25:37.925
You wanted this.

01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:42.179
I wanted this?

01:25:43.222 --> 01:25:44.515
Just me?

01:25:44.849 --> 01:25:48.144
God, you are just like every other guy.

01:25:48.227 --> 01:25:51.022
The sad thing is, Dylan,
I actually thought you were different.

01:25:51.105 --> 01:25:53.357
Different from what?
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your friend.

01:25:54.191 --> 01:25:56.360
Well, with friends like you,
who needs friends?

01:25:59.113 --> 01:26:03.534
And thank you for ruining my mountaintop.

01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:05.703
Asshole.

01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:14.587
Hey, man, you can't be up here.

01:26:15.463 --> 01:26:16.630
Okay.

01:26:16.922 --> 01:26:19.592
– You okay?
– I'm fine.

01:26:46.243 --> 01:26:48.287
<i>Bryce, is this for me?</i>

01:26:48.579 --> 01:26:50.956
<i>Yeah. And so is this.</i>

01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:53.918
<i>Madison, will you marry me?</i>

01:26:54.251 --> 01:26:56.170
<i>You bet your ass, Flapjack!</i>

01:26:58.422 --> 01:27:00.674
<i>– I love New York.
– I love you.</i>

01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:03.302
<i>Oh, my God.
Look, the Empire State Building.</i>

01:27:03.511 --> 01:27:04.678
<i>Wow.</i>

01:27:04.762 --> 01:27:06.347
<i>Oh, look, the Statue of Liberty.</i>

01:27:13.687 --> 01:27:15.106
Hello, this is Jamie.

01:27:16.941 --> 01:27:18.859
What do you mean they went to him directly?

01:27:19.944 --> 01:27:21.445
Well, is he gonna take it?

01:27:21.612 --> 01:27:24.698
No, no, no, no, no. I'll handle it.
I'll call him right now.

01:27:24.782 --> 01:27:25.950
Okay.

01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:31.455
<i>Hey, this is Dylan. Leave a message.</i>

01:27:39.839 --> 01:27:41.507
Excuse me. May I help you?

01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:43.759
Oh, hi. Where's Dylan Harper?

01:27:43.843 --> 01:27:45.469
He's at a photo shoot for the sports issue.

01:27:45.970 --> 01:27:49.223
That's right. The photo shoot.
Where was that again?

01:27:49.473 --> 01:27:50.558
I'm sorry. Who are you?

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:52.476
One of the models.

01:27:53.185 --> 01:27:55.312
I have the perfect body for Photoshop.

01:27:55.813 --> 01:27:59.400
Yeah, this gets more angular,
these get longer,

01:27:59.525 --> 01:28:01.819
and this gets way more Christian.

01:28:02.319 --> 01:28:04.405
So where did you say he was again?

01:28:05.489 --> 01:28:08.868
Sports is the last chance we have
of bringing our world together, bro.

01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:12.079
So I just wanted to shoot some photos
that speak to that,

01:28:12.163 --> 01:28:14.540
to the unification of all people
through sports.

01:28:14.665 --> 01:28:16.041
Okay, guys. Let's go.

01:28:16.667 --> 01:28:17.835
That's it.

01:28:18.377 --> 01:28:19.587
Beautiful.

01:28:19.753 --> 01:28:21.464
Okay, now put your arms around each other,

01:28:21.547 --> 01:28:23.883
like you like each other,
like you love each other.

01:28:24.258 --> 01:28:26.510
– Too gay?
– A little bit.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.888
Throw some girls in there.

01:28:29.013 --> 01:28:31.348
Come on, ladies. Hop to.

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:36.228
Girls, girls. Okay, look. Just blend in.

01:28:36.687 --> 01:28:38.898
Okay, let's go boy, girl, boy…

01:28:39.023 --> 01:28:40.858
– Dylan.
– …boy, boy, boy, boys.

01:28:41.692 --> 01:28:43.527
– What are you doing here?
– You met for another job!

01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:46.363
– What, are you gonna leave now?
– I don't know. Yeah, I took one meeting.

01:28:46.447 --> 01:28:48.866
– I can't believe you.
– Come here.

01:28:49.909 --> 01:28:51.994
– Is this your way of getting back at me?
– What?

01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:54.205
You know that if you leave
before a year is up, I get screwed.

01:28:54.455 --> 01:28:55.915
Oh, right.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.249
If I did leave,

01:28:57.374 --> 01:29:00.169
which I don't know yet
because all I did was take one meeting,

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:02.087
I'd write you a cheque for your bonus.

01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:05.758
Whatever it is, I'll pay for it.
Happy now? We good?

01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:08.219
– Why didn't you tell me you were looking?
– That's personal.

01:29:08.302 --> 01:29:10.596
And we're not friends anymore.
You made that pretty clear.

01:29:12.139 --> 01:29:15.809
See, all I wanted to do
was have sex with you. Remember?

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.145
Pretend you were the best friend I'd ever had.

01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:20.064
Open up to you
like I've never done with anyone ever.

01:29:20.397 --> 01:29:23.734
And then when the sex stopped,
invite you to LA for the weekend

01:29:25.319 --> 01:29:26.779
to introduce you to my family.

01:29:28.322 --> 01:29:30.741
– I'll send you a cheque if I take the job.
– Don't bother.

01:29:35.788 --> 01:29:37.831
Why don't you pick him up?

01:29:38.249 --> 01:29:40.834
Yeah. Just pick him on up.

01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:43.254
Oh, you little Christ figure, you!

01:30:07.444 --> 01:30:09.780
– Hey, Dyl.
– Dad's coming into Newark Airport, right?

01:30:09.863 --> 01:30:11.615
Yeah, he leaves at 9:00 our time.

01:30:11.782 --> 01:30:14.618
9:00. So it's a five-hour flight,
three-hour time difference,

01:30:14.702 --> 01:30:17.329
so he gets in at 32:00?

01:30:17.454 --> 01:30:20.457
5:00. Be there at 5:00, Dylan.

01:30:20.708 --> 01:30:22.668
Right. How is Dad?

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:26.839
He's lost more often than not now.

01:30:26.964 --> 01:30:29.967
But then he has these moments
of real clarity. It's hit or miss.

01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:31.218
– Okay.
– How's Jamie?

01:30:33.721 --> 01:30:35.306
– That's over.
– Oh, Dylan!

01:30:35.472 --> 01:30:38.517
– Okay, we're done.
– Don't be an idiot, please.

01:30:38.642 --> 01:30:40.978
Thank you, Annie.
I'll pick up Dad tomorrow at the airport.

01:30:41.061 --> 01:30:42.813
– 32:00 sharp.
– I love you.

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:47.860
I don't know what it is.

01:30:47.985 --> 01:30:50.487
I just can't get myself
to start looking for a replacement for him,

01:30:50.571 --> 01:30:51.655
assuming that he leaves.

01:30:51.739 --> 01:30:54.950
– Do you want some motherly love advice?
– Not really.

01:30:55.034 --> 01:30:56.785
Oh, good, 'cause I don't know
how to do that.

01:30:56.869 --> 01:31:00.456
What I do know is that
it's no great goddamn secret

01:31:00.539 --> 01:31:03.250
you live in fear of repeating my mistakes.

01:31:03.334 --> 01:31:05.419
And you're not wrong, so learn from me.

01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:08.672
Do you know how many men in my life
I thought were really perfect?

01:31:08.881 --> 01:31:10.007
– Eighty.
– One.

01:31:10.174 --> 01:31:11.842
– Eighty-one?
– One.

01:31:12.051 --> 01:31:14.511
It was your dad. Greatest man I ever met.

01:31:14.595 --> 01:31:16.263
Obviously. Look at you.

01:31:16.347 --> 01:31:19.558
How smart you are, how great,
how funny, how driven.

01:31:19.683 --> 01:31:21.018
Your vaguely Middle Eastern beauty.

01:31:21.101 --> 01:31:23.854
Sure as hell didn't all come from me.

01:31:24.188 --> 01:31:26.273
Okay, but, seriously, Mom,

01:31:26.357 --> 01:31:28.692
do you really not remember
where my dad's from?

01:31:28.901 --> 01:31:30.527
Or is it like a coping mechanism?

01:31:30.611 --> 01:31:32.404
– A little of both.
– Okay.

01:31:32.529 --> 01:31:35.032
But I'm pretty sure he's Eurasian.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:39.870
I mean, we all have our Prince Charming,
you just gotta know him when you see him.

01:31:40.037 --> 01:31:42.539
Mom, it's Prince Charming.
You should just know.

01:31:42.623 --> 01:31:45.876
Well, your Prince Charming isn't coming
to rescue you in a horse and carriage.

01:31:45.959 --> 01:31:47.628
That's not who you want.

01:31:47.711 --> 01:31:51.632
I mean, you're looking for a man
to be your partner.

01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:54.259
To take on the world with.

01:31:54.385 --> 01:31:57.137
You gotta update your fairytale, baby.

01:31:57.763 --> 01:31:59.598
My Prince Charming?

01:32:00.307 --> 01:32:01.642
You.

01:32:01.809 --> 01:32:02.893
Mom.

01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:28.752
– Hey.
– A wheelchair. Like I'm an invalid.

01:32:28.919 --> 01:32:30.462
– How was the flight?
– I'm hungry.

01:32:30.587 --> 01:32:32.297
You know they don't serve food
in coach anymore?

01:32:32.423 --> 01:32:34.675
You'd think with these new planes,
they practically fly themselves,

01:32:34.758 --> 01:32:37.302
they could get rid of a pilot
and use his salary for a hot lunch.

01:32:37.428 --> 01:32:39.847
– I know, right? Let's get you some food.
– God.

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:42.516
The engineering on these planes
is so advanced.

01:32:42.599 --> 01:32:43.809
Completely computerised.

01:32:43.934 --> 01:32:45.936
– It's like playing a video game.
– Exactly.

01:32:46.103 --> 01:32:48.939
God. How long have we been waiting here?
It's ridiculous.

01:32:49.106 --> 01:32:51.150
I'll be right back, okay?

01:32:53.944 --> 01:32:55.988
Excuse me. We've been waiting a while.

01:32:56.113 --> 01:32:57.781
– Harper.
– Yeah, I got you. I got you.

01:32:57.865 --> 01:32:59.491
I have to seat people in the order they came.

01:32:59.616 --> 01:33:01.535
I totally understand that, but I'm with my dad

01:33:01.618 --> 01:33:03.495
– and he's not in the best shape.
– I'm sorry.

01:33:03.662 --> 01:33:05.456
Is there no way we could,
like, squeeze a table?

01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:08.375
No, I gotta go by the list. Sorry.

01:33:12.296 --> 01:33:13.464
Dad?

01:33:20.304 --> 01:33:21.472
Dad?

01:33:22.806 --> 01:33:24.308
Shit. Dad?

01:33:37.029 --> 01:33:38.489
You gonna join me?

01:33:48.207 --> 01:33:49.833
Absolutely.

01:33:54.546 --> 01:33:56.340
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry, you cannot do this.

01:33:56.423 --> 01:33:58.634
Could I get a steak, medium, please?

01:33:58.717 --> 01:34:00.677
– Sir, this is the Daily Grill.
– Make that two.

01:34:09.853 --> 01:34:11.230
Dede? Dede!

01:34:20.197 --> 01:34:21.365
Dad.

01:34:21.865 --> 01:34:23.200
Dad.

01:34:27.037 --> 01:34:28.121
Who is Dede?

01:34:28.914 --> 01:34:33.210
Jesus. She's just a girl that I met in the Navy.

01:34:34.294 --> 01:34:35.712
Was…

01:34:38.215 --> 01:34:39.800
She was the love of my life.

01:34:41.385 --> 01:34:42.427
Okay?

01:34:43.554 --> 01:34:44.888
Why didn't you tell me about her before?

01:34:45.055 --> 01:34:47.891
This is not something
you discuss with your children.

01:34:47.975 --> 01:34:50.852
And besides, I have you and Annie.
I have no regrets.

01:34:50.936 --> 01:34:51.979
So tell me now.

01:34:54.231 --> 01:34:55.607
She was the love of my life.

01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:56.984
And I was too stupid to realise it,

01:34:57.067 --> 01:35:00.153
and I lost her because of something
so dumb I don't even remember.

01:35:00.904 --> 01:35:02.322
And I never really got over her.

01:35:02.906 --> 01:35:06.660
And I think that may be
one of the reasons your mom left.

01:35:07.911 --> 01:35:11.456
You know, my friends used to say that
when Dede and I looked at each other,

01:35:11.582 --> 01:35:12.749
it was electric.

01:35:12.833 --> 01:35:14.084
And I let her go.

01:35:14.501 --> 01:35:15.836
I just let her go.

01:35:15.919 --> 01:35:19.464
Because I was too damn proud
to tell her how I really felt about her.

01:35:20.173 --> 01:35:22.759
I'll tell you something that I wish
I knew when I was your age.

01:35:22.926 --> 01:35:24.761
And I know you've heard
a million times, "life is short."

01:35:24.845 --> 01:35:28.432
But let me tell you something,
what this is teaching me

01:35:28.515 --> 01:35:31.643
is that life is goddamn short
and you can't waste a minute of it.

01:35:34.271 --> 01:35:36.106
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:35:40.611 --> 01:35:44.448
The girl I brought home to LA, Jamie?

01:35:44.531 --> 01:35:47.200
– Yeah, what's going on with her?
– I think I messed it up.

01:35:47.701 --> 01:35:49.286
– Fix it.
– She won't talk to me.

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:51.747
Maybe she'll listen. There's always a way.

01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:56.501
If you think there's even a chance
that she could be it, you fix it.

01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:59.880
Did Annie put you up to this?

01:36:00.631 --> 01:36:01.798
Who's Annie?

01:36:02.341 --> 01:36:03.508
I'm kidding.

01:36:03.634 --> 01:36:05.927
What, I can't joke about this?

01:36:06.011 --> 01:36:08.513
– Jesus Christ, Dad.
– I don't know what else to do.

01:36:10.349 --> 01:36:11.475
Let's go.

01:36:11.850 --> 01:36:13.894
You don't want to finish your steak?

01:36:13.977 --> 01:36:16.855
We're eating in the goddamn airport.
I can leave the steak. Come on.

01:36:17.356 --> 01:36:21.318
Yeah, hey, this is Dylan Harper from <i>GQ</i>.
We met a few weeks ago at the…

01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:23.862
Right. Hey, can I ask you a huge favour?

01:36:24.196 --> 01:36:26.657
– I am so sorry, sir.
– It's my fault.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.283
– You just scared me.
– No, no. My fault. You all right?

01:36:28.367 --> 01:36:29.868
– Yeah, I'm good.
– Here, let me help you with that.

01:36:29.993 --> 01:36:32.579
– Thanks, man. You're really nice.
– All right. Hey, safe travels.

01:36:32.663 --> 01:36:34.164
– All right, thanks, man.
– Okay, thank you.

01:36:34.915 --> 01:36:38.752
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
All right, let's dance, Clowny Brown.

01:36:38.919 --> 01:36:41.588
– What's your problem with me?
– I saw you at that bar with Jamie.

01:36:41.838 --> 01:36:45.425
How could such an awesome girl
be with this over this?

01:36:46.176 --> 01:36:49.012
I've been trying to take that little monkey
to pound-town for years.

01:36:49.513 --> 01:36:51.348
– I'll tell her you say hello.
– What?

01:36:51.556 --> 01:36:53.600
You missed a little. There you go.

01:36:53.684 --> 01:36:55.352
Dylan! I got a cab. Come on.

01:36:55.435 --> 01:36:56.853
I ever run into you again,

01:36:56.937 --> 01:36:59.356
I'll crush your earlobes
and make soup stock out of them.

01:36:59.523 --> 01:37:01.525
– You have a vivid imagination.
– I do!

01:37:01.608 --> 01:37:03.944
– I'm gonna get in the cab now.
– I'm gonna go make soup!

01:37:04.027 --> 01:37:05.904
– What's the matter with her?
– I don't know.

01:37:10.033 --> 01:37:13.370
God! I thought LA was bad.
This traffic is terrible.

01:37:13.537 --> 01:37:14.788
Is there another way into the city?

01:37:25.215 --> 01:37:27.300
I owe you big time, Tommy.

01:37:27.384 --> 01:37:31.763
You'll make it up to me.
Actually, I was heading into town anyway.

01:37:32.264 --> 01:37:36.560
Tonight's the Butterfly Ball.
Great place to pick up dudes.

01:37:36.727 --> 01:37:38.895
– You okay, Dad?
– Are you kidding?

01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:42.357
1937 Chris-Craft?
Couldn't get any better, buddy.

01:37:42.441 --> 01:37:43.567
Nice.

01:37:45.819 --> 01:37:47.988
Yeah. Hi, this is Dylan. We met at…

01:37:48.071 --> 01:37:51.158
Right. Can I ask you a huge favour?

01:37:55.662 --> 01:37:57.998
My number. Here's the remote.

01:37:58.248 --> 01:38:01.418
My friend Dave from across the hall,
his oven broke, so he'll be using the kitchen.

01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:04.838
Your friend Dave is here using the kitchen
or watching me?

01:38:05.255 --> 01:38:06.590
Go.

01:38:06.757 --> 01:38:08.300
– Holy…
– What?

01:38:08.425 --> 01:38:10.260
"How to wear white pants to a cookout."

01:38:10.427 --> 01:38:13.513
Did you scoop the <i>Times</i> on this?
I smell Pulitzer.

01:38:14.097 --> 01:38:15.307
All right, all right.

01:38:15.432 --> 01:38:16.850
Just say hello to her for me, will you?

01:38:17.851 --> 01:38:19.269
See you, Dad.

01:38:20.604 --> 01:38:21.772
Thanks, man.

01:38:22.147 --> 01:38:23.690
Hi, Dave from across the hall.

01:38:23.774 --> 01:38:27.486
Hi, Mr Harper. How are you?

01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:29.946
And now we know why you're here.

01:38:30.947 --> 01:38:34.534
Mom, I'm over by the Lexington exit.
Where are you?

01:38:34.618 --> 01:38:36.745
<i>I'm standing right by the guy in the tie.</i>

01:38:36.828 --> 01:38:40.499
– There are a million guys in ties.
<i>– So look for the guy I'm standing next to.</i>

01:38:40.624 --> 01:38:43.460
You never do what you say you're gonna do.
When am I gonna learn?

01:38:43.668 --> 01:38:45.170
<i>Just hang on, baby.</i>

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:50.884
What?

01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:55.138
<i>I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it after all.</i>

01:38:55.222 --> 01:38:57.349
<i>Something came up. Let's meet tomorrow.</i>

01:38:57.474 --> 01:39:00.560
I'll be on the stairs. Right across from you.

01:39:05.023 --> 01:39:06.483
Oh, my God.

01:39:06.858 --> 01:39:08.318
Have a great night, baby.

01:39:27.712 --> 01:39:29.256
What is this?

01:39:29.381 --> 01:39:32.050
It's <i>Closing Time</i>, by the band Semisonic!

01:39:32.342 --> 01:39:34.636
It's not Third Eye Blind.
Can you believe that?

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:37.514
No, no, no. Not the song. This.

01:39:37.722 --> 01:39:39.724
You said you wanted your life
to be like a movie.

01:39:40.684 --> 01:39:44.271
Sorry I had to use the real Grand Central
instead of the fake one.

01:39:51.027 --> 01:39:52.112
Listen, Jamie, I'm…

01:39:52.195 --> 01:39:54.364
I'm having trouble hearing you!

01:39:54.447 --> 01:39:56.324
Yeah, I didn't really think this through.

01:39:56.408 --> 01:39:58.743
I guess in the movies
the guy pours his heart out

01:39:58.869 --> 01:40:00.245
and they put the music in later.

01:40:00.412 --> 01:40:01.580
What?

01:40:04.875 --> 01:40:06.042
I messed up.

01:40:07.043 --> 01:40:08.545
I was scared.

01:40:09.379 --> 01:40:11.089
Look at what happened
with my mom and my dad.

01:40:11.214 --> 01:40:12.299
Of course I was scared.

01:40:13.133 --> 01:40:14.551
So I ruined it.

01:40:15.719 --> 01:40:17.512
Everything that happens in the day,

01:40:17.596 --> 01:40:20.765
all I can think to myself is,
"I can't wait to tell Jamie about this."

01:40:21.766 --> 01:40:24.895
When I see someone cursing,
all I picture is you blinking.

01:40:25.729 --> 01:40:30.317
And when I hear a kid's been cured of cancer,
I pray it's not by that douchebag,

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.320
tree-hugging fucking doctor
who ran out on you.

01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:37.949
I mean, cancer being cured is awesome,
but, you know, I wish someone else did it.

01:40:38.825 --> 01:40:40.118
Come on.

01:40:45.081 --> 01:40:47.417
Hey, I miss you.

01:40:47.584 --> 01:40:49.419
Yeah, I miss you, too.

01:40:49.628 --> 01:40:51.588
But you're not wrong, I am damaged.

01:40:51.755 --> 01:40:53.965
So am I. Who isn't?

01:40:54.257 --> 01:40:56.134
That's what makes us so awesome.

01:40:56.259 --> 01:40:57.928
– And our tattoos.
– Yeah.

01:41:00.096 --> 01:41:02.599
– No, no, no.
– Shut up. It's not what you think.

01:41:03.141 --> 01:41:05.602
Jamie, will you be my best friend again?

01:41:06.645 --> 01:41:08.939
– That is so lame.
– I know.

01:41:10.106 --> 01:41:11.733
That's some Prince Charming shit,
though, right?

01:41:11.816 --> 01:41:13.026
– Get up.
– Okay.

01:41:14.611 --> 01:41:17.822
Look, I can live without
ever having sex with you again.

01:41:18.198 --> 01:41:20.033
It'd be really hard.

01:41:20.492 --> 01:41:23.328
Hey, I want my best friend back,

01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:25.455
because I'm in love with her.

01:41:26.331 --> 01:41:28.792
– Under one condition.
– Anything.

01:41:30.627 --> 01:41:31.962
Kiss me.

01:41:33.546 --> 01:41:36.174
– In public? In front of all these people?
– I did not ask you to…

01:41:55.819 --> 01:41:57.821
You can all go home now.

01:42:04.077 --> 01:42:06.037
Okay. So…

01:42:08.999 --> 01:42:11.167
– What do we do now?
– Have our first date.

01:42:11.543 --> 01:42:12.669
Okay.

01:42:15.839 --> 01:42:18.925
Oh, my God!
Did you get a horse and carriage?

01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:21.845
Yeah, that's not for you.

01:42:22.053 --> 01:42:25.098
Oh, thank God.
Horses actually scare the shit out of me.

01:42:25.265 --> 01:42:26.516
– Really?
– Yeah.

01:42:26.683 --> 01:42:27.934
So, where are you from?

01:42:28.018 --> 01:42:30.562
– Outside of Philly, actually.
– Interesting.

01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:34.357
– I'm from LA, just moved to New York.
– Interesting. Didn't really ask, but go on.

01:42:34.441 --> 01:42:37.736
What? I'm excited, I'm on a first date. So…

01:42:38.069 --> 01:42:40.238
This isn't weird at all.

01:42:40.363 --> 01:42:42.532
– We're okay.
– Yeah. Thank you.

01:42:44.909 --> 01:42:46.536
So…

01:42:49.122 --> 01:42:50.707
Yeah, fuck it.

01:49:01.911 --> 01:49:05.665
Roll credits, roll credits, roll credits.
And here come the outtakes.

01:49:06.082 --> 01:49:09.419
Because if the actors had
a good time making it, it must be good.

01:49:09.585 --> 01:49:11.421
<i>You bet your ass, Jason.</i>

01:49:12.004 --> 01:49:14.424
<i>Oh, my God, I just called him Jason.</i>

01:49:14.507 --> 01:49:16.259
Look, the crew's laughing.

01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:20.138
<i>They made me do it! They made me do it.</i>

01:49:20.805 --> 01:49:22.265
It's my favourite part.
