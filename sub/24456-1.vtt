[man on radio]: Anything?

00:25.416 --> 00:26.635
Not yet.

00:27.853 --> 00:30.291
Just walking and talking,

00:30.334 --> 00:32.336
but no dropping to one knee.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.295
What's taking this boy
so long?

00:34.338 --> 00:36.514
Hold on.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.125
Something's happening.

00:38.168 --> 00:40.649
Plans change, Susie.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.085
We're not the same kids

00:42.129 --> 00:44.305
who dreamed
about getting married.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.089
It took me a long time
to admit that,

00:46.133 --> 00:48.091
mainly because I don't want
to let you down.

00:48.135 --> 00:51.051
I feel like I've put my life
on hold for you.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.226
I was waiting for you.

00:52.269 --> 00:53.575
But you didn't have to.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.707
You could've started
your business without me.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.970
Why didn't you?

00:59.668 --> 01:02.801
Guess this is goodbye, then.

01:04.107 --> 01:06.066
I'm sorry.

01:07.676 --> 01:10.331
Oh...

01:10.374 --> 01:12.159
This doesn't look good at all.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.336
Oh, boy...

01:15.379 --> 01:16.293
What's, "Oh, boy..."?

01:17.425 --> 01:20.123
Your sister and Adam.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.559
Oh.

01:21.603 --> 01:24.562
Tell Susie I will of course
be her Maid of Honor,

01:24.606 --> 01:26.564
but I get to pick
the dress color.

01:26.608 --> 01:29.219
No peach taffeta
like Zoe Snow's wedding.

01:29.263 --> 01:30.220
The worst!

01:30.264 --> 01:31.569
Avery, honey...

01:31.613 --> 01:33.267
that's not going
to be a problem.

01:36.748 --> 01:40.100
I'm so sorry.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.103
[sister]:
You can do better!

01:43.146 --> 01:44.756
Mom, are you
giving Avery

01:44.800 --> 01:47.324
a play-by-play
of my break up?

01:47.368 --> 01:48.760
In my defense,

01:48.804 --> 01:50.153
I thought this was going
to have a different outcome.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.984
Can you just tell Dad
I'm going to skip work today?

01:55.027 --> 01:56.464
I just need to clear my head.

01:56.507 --> 01:59.206
[dad]:
It's okay, baby.

01:59.249 --> 02:00.816

02:59.527 --> 03:01.529
-Hello.
-Hi.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.313
Do you need some help?

03:03.357 --> 03:05.359
Uh, I do
if you have a tire jack.

03:05.402 --> 03:06.360
A tire jack?

03:06.403 --> 03:07.665
Why, did you get a flat?

03:07.709 --> 03:10.015
Yeah, that's why
I need the tire jack.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.843
Well, shouldn't you have...?

03:11.887 --> 03:13.323
You don't have one.
Look at that.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.282
Yeah, my sister
borrowed it.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.327
She got a flat a few weeks ago,

03:17.371 --> 03:18.459
and she was supposed
to return it...

03:18.502 --> 03:19.677
But she didn't.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.636
Yeah, which I'm just now
finding out about.

03:21.679 --> 03:24.160
Well, then this must be
your lucky day.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.814
I don't know about that,
but...

03:25.857 --> 03:27.076
Come on.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.556
Let's see if we can find you
a tire jack.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.393
Ah-hah!

03:39.436 --> 03:40.872
Success!

03:40.916 --> 03:42.309
Yes!

03:45.225 --> 03:47.009
Do you need something else?

03:47.052 --> 03:48.793
Uh...

03:48.837 --> 03:50.752
well, I rather thought
there'd be instructions.

03:50.795 --> 03:53.102
Have you never
changed a tire before?

03:53.145 --> 03:55.060
First time for everything.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.367

03:57.411 --> 03:58.803
Oh, sorry.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.807
Hi, Nate Kenneth.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.287
I'm Susanna Truitt.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.636
Susanna, nice to meet you.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.508
Shall we?

04:07.551 --> 04:08.683
Yeah.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.424
Let's give this a go.

04:10.467 --> 04:11.555
Thank you so much.

04:11.599 --> 04:12.469
Of course. Do you
mind holding this?

04:12.513 --> 04:13.427
Not at all.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.558
Thank you.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.346

like that,

country called Cambria?

04:28.355 --> 04:29.834
Um...

04:29.878 --> 04:32.750
no, but I'm not that good
at geography.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.186
It's all right.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.797
It's a challenge
even for those that are,

04:35.840 --> 04:37.320
mainly due to the fact

04:37.364 --> 04:38.713
that it's not much larger
than your St. Simons Island.

04:38.756 --> 04:39.888
Um, may I?

04:39.931 --> 04:41.324
Please, thank you.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.954
What do you do?

05:02.998 --> 05:05.653
Ah, landscape architecture.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.089
Oh, impressive.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.526
I mean, I'm still trying
to get things on my resume.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.876
There's not a lot
of landscape architect firms

05:11.920 --> 05:13.574
on the island, so...

05:13.617 --> 05:15.402
Why don't you start
your own firm?

05:15.445 --> 05:16.403
You're the second person
to say that to me

05:16.446 --> 05:18.970
in two hours.

05:19.014 --> 05:21.669
First one was my boyfriend
as he was breaking up with me.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.325
I'm sorry, that was...
I don't...

05:25.368 --> 05:26.630
I don't know
why I said that.

05:26.674 --> 05:27.849
Well, listen,

05:27.892 --> 05:29.024
sometimes,
it's easier to tell things

05:29.067 --> 05:30.286
to a complete stranger.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.375
Yeah, maybe,

05:32.419 --> 05:34.116
but I don't really have
an answer

05:34.159 --> 05:36.379
for either one of you,

05:36.423 --> 05:38.338
or myself.

to open up our business

05:39.991 --> 05:41.253

05:41.297 --> 05:45.388
but clearly, that's not
going to happen anymore.

05:45.432 --> 05:49.349
I've had my plans change
unexpectedly, too.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.307

difficult.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.874

Oh, wait, here.

Is this a handkerchief?

06:02.579 --> 06:03.972
It is.

06:04.015 --> 06:07.845
Never met anyone our age
with a handkerchief before.

06:07.889 --> 06:09.804
Are you sure you're not,
like, a time traveler

06:09.847 --> 06:11.458
from another era
or something?

06:11.501 --> 06:12.763
Not that I'm aware of.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.504
Okay.

06:14.548 --> 06:17.333
Oh...
ugh, I'm sorry.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.465
That's all right.
That's what it's for.

06:18.508 --> 06:19.901
Um... I'll clean it.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.685
I'll clean it
and get it back to you.

06:21.729 --> 06:22.730
All right.

06:29.171 --> 06:31.086
That tree is
incredible.

06:31.129 --> 06:34.394
Yeah, it's called
Lover's Oak.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.699
There's a legend

06:35.743 --> 06:36.744
that if a couple gets engaged
underneath it,

06:36.787 --> 06:37.788
they'll stay married forever.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.791
I used to have
all these fantasies

06:40.835 --> 06:44.012
about getting proposed to
underneath there.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.622
Nothing fancy,

06:45.666 --> 06:48.233
just, you know, the entire thing
covered in twinkle lights...

06:48.277 --> 06:49.278
a little fancy.

06:51.541 --> 06:52.673
Yeah, I guess...

06:52.716 --> 06:55.850

but...

06:55.893 --> 06:58.461

07:10.734 --> 07:11.996

07:12.040 --> 07:12.997
Yeah, that's where
they recreated

07:13.041 --> 07:14.521
the Florentine Gardens, right?

07:14.564 --> 07:16.436
Yes, that's right.

07:16.479 --> 07:17.611
Right.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.482
Breathtaking,
aren't they?

07:19.526 --> 07:21.223
I couldn't agree more.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.966

07:25.009 --> 07:26.663

07:30.014 --> 07:31.146

It was one drive.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.385
Lasting
two hours.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.693
I went to clear my head,

08:39.736 --> 08:42.826
but then I helped
a damsel in distress.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.174
We sort of
worked together,

08:44.219 --> 08:47.048
but got my hands dirty.

Hi.

09:04.282 --> 09:05.153
Hi.

09:05.196 --> 09:06.676
I never liked Adam.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.722
Yes, you did.

09:08.765 --> 09:11.638
Retroactively, I didn't.

09:11.681 --> 09:14.292
I figured you'd be
all red-eyed and puffy,

09:14.336 --> 09:15.816
but you seem okay.

09:15.859 --> 09:19.297
I mean, trust me,
it's not fun.

09:19.341 --> 09:20.690
I'm just trying
to figure it out.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.692
We had all these plans,
like...

09:22.736 --> 09:23.911
we were going to get married
when he finished his tour.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.695
We were going to open
the business together,

09:25.739 --> 09:26.914
and...

09:26.957 --> 09:28.785
oof...

09:28.829 --> 09:29.830
now I have literally
no idea

09:29.873 --> 09:31.092
what I'm doing
with my life, so...

09:32.093 --> 09:34.356
Maybe you could have one?

09:36.053 --> 09:37.098
Meaning?

09:38.229 --> 09:39.230
Meaning...

09:40.449 --> 09:41.755

for this or that...

him to propose,

09:43.539 --> 09:44.801
blah, blah, blah.

09:44.845 --> 09:48.196
Meanwhile, you keep
working for Mom and Dad

09:48.239 --> 09:50.720
despite having
a degree...

09:50.764 --> 09:52.113
that just hangs there,

09:52.156 --> 09:56.073
like a very expensive
wall ornament.

09:56.117 --> 09:58.336
Well, Adam and I were going
to open the business together.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.425
So...

10:00.469 --> 10:01.426
now you start it
on your own.

10:03.341 --> 10:05.605
If anybody can do it,
it's my big sister.

10:10.958 --> 10:11.915
What is this?

10:11.959 --> 10:13.221
Oh, it's...

10:13.264 --> 10:14.744
it's...
a reminder...

10:14.788 --> 10:19.923
that even on a really lousy day,
some good can happen.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.755
Have you been enjoying
your stay so far?

10:25.799 --> 10:26.756
Your hospitality,
Mrs. Waller,

10:26.800 --> 10:29.106
is, as always, impeccable.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.760
You remind me so much
of your father

10:30.804 --> 10:32.022
when he was your age.

10:32.066 --> 10:34.155
I can only hope to be
half the man he was.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.896
I have no doubt
that you will be.

10:37.506 --> 10:39.377
When do you head home
for the festivities?

10:39.421 --> 10:40.814
A fortnight.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.032
Oof.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.555
Well, I hope you're
planning to get out

10:43.599 --> 10:45.427
and see some of
our little island...

10:45.470 --> 10:46.558
see the sites,
meet some people?

10:48.038 --> 10:50.084
You know, I've actually
already met one of your locals.

10:50.127 --> 10:51.085
Susanna Truitt?

10:51.128 --> 10:53.478
Glo and Gib Truitt's eldest?

10:53.522 --> 10:55.219
Possibly.
She's a landscape architect.

10:55.263 --> 10:58.048
I came upon her stranded
on the side of the road.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.354
And you helped
her out, I hope?

10:59.397 --> 11:02.226
We sort of worked together.

11:02.270 --> 11:03.314
Capable woman.

11:04.707 --> 11:07.579
Did you say Susanna's
a landscape architect now?

11:07.623 --> 11:09.233
I did.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.452
In fact,

11:10.495 --> 11:11.975
I was hoping to talk to you
about that.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.722
[Avery]: Thank you.
Have a great day.

11:19.766 --> 11:20.984
Where's Dad?

11:21.028 --> 11:22.377
He's, like, 20 minutes
late for his shift.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.292
Did you text him?

11:24.335 --> 11:25.989
Mm, no answer.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.121
Hmm.

11:27.164 --> 11:28.513
You know what,
can you just take my car

11:28.557 --> 11:29.993
and just pop by and make sure
everything's okay?

11:30.037 --> 11:31.778
Why do I have to
be the one to go?

11:31.821 --> 11:32.822
Okay, fine.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.041
I'll go, and you can just stay

11:34.084 --> 11:36.521
and watch the store
all by yourself.

11:36.565 --> 11:37.653
Thought so.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.176
Bye.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.100
Here, let me...

11:52.407 --> 11:53.234
You again?

11:53.277 --> 11:54.148
Me again.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.021
What brings you here?

11:58.065 --> 11:59.544
Fate.

11:59.588 --> 12:00.676
Fate?

12:00.720 --> 12:01.677
Indeed.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.723
As it happens,

12:03.766 --> 12:05.768
Mrs. Waller needs a guiding hand
when it comes to her garden,

12:05.812 --> 12:07.509
and thanks
to our earlier encounter,

12:07.552 --> 12:10.338
I just so happen to know
a landscape architect.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.818
So, Fate.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.733
Oh, no, no,
no, no... mm-mm.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.212
No?

12:15.256 --> 12:16.257
No.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.998
I can't do
Mrs. Waller's gardens.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.564
I'm an amateur.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.480
You said you were
a landscape architect.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.613
An amateur landscape
architect.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.180
I haven't done
anything big, and I...

12:26.223 --> 12:27.703
[phone buzzing]

12:27.747 --> 12:28.704
certainly can't
do anything

12:28.748 --> 12:30.010
to Mrs. Waller's
expectations.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.881
Plus, I don't want to go
and embarrass you.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.665
You wouldn't embarrass me.

12:33.709 --> 12:34.754
Come on, at least
take the meeting.

12:36.843 --> 12:37.800
What if I blow it?

12:37.844 --> 12:39.454
What if you don't?

12:39.497 --> 12:40.890
[phone buzzing]

12:40.934 --> 12:41.891
Excuse me, sorry.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.588
This keeps...

12:47.549 --> 12:49.029
What is it?

12:49.072 --> 12:50.944
It's my father.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.249
I need to get
to the hospital.

12:52.293 --> 12:53.729
Ugh, Avery has my car.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.426
I'll drive you.
Come.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.471
Okay...

13:02.694 --> 13:05.132
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Gib Truitt's room.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.176
Thank you.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.398
Dad?

13:10.441 --> 13:11.921
-Is everything okay?
-I'm fine, honey.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.793
There's nothing wrong with me.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.490
Stress-induced
heart palpitations.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.187
I told you I didn't need
to come in for this.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.059
You did the exact
right thing.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.802
You, Gib Truitt,
you need to rest...

13:22.845 --> 13:23.846
at least a week,
maybe more.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.369
It's spring, Doc.

13:25.413 --> 13:26.893
It's our busiest time.

13:26.936 --> 13:28.764
Gib...

13:28.808 --> 13:30.461
were you under the impression
this was optional?

13:30.505 --> 13:32.246
Because it's not.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.640
He's going to rest.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.077
I promise.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.905
I'll see you
next week.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.821
You have to listen
to the doctor.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.170
Yeah, but the store...

13:43.213 --> 13:44.649
We'll figure something out, Dad.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.347
You're what's
important, Dad.

13:48.044 --> 13:50.003
[P.A. announcement]:
Dr. Shipp to Emerg.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.526
Dr. Shipp to Emerg.

13:53.180 --> 13:56.357
You know I'm pleased as punch
I'm surrounded by strong women,

13:56.400 --> 14:00.665
but there's a little matter
of heavy lifting involved.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.058
We can manage,

14:02.102 --> 14:04.147
and if we can't,
we'll hire someone.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.366
Mm.

14:06.802 --> 14:10.632
I'm not comfortable
with just anyone in the store...

14:10.675 --> 14:12.329
and we need someone now.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.505
Well, perhaps
I can be of assistance.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.252
You stayed.
Thank you.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.515
I wanted to make sure
your father was all right,

14:24.559 --> 14:25.690
and I'm quite serious.

14:25.734 --> 14:26.822
I'm happy to help out
through the week

14:26.866 --> 14:27.997
while he recuperates.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.172
You're on vacation.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.565
Well, the best part of which

14:30.608 --> 14:32.001
is being able
to do as I please.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.785
[Avery]: And you want
to spend a week

14:33.829 --> 14:35.091
working
in a garden supply store?

14:35.135 --> 14:36.005
I would.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.877
What is it you do again?

14:38.965 --> 14:40.053
Public relations,

14:40.096 --> 14:43.273
but I spent quite a bit of time
as a boy

14:43.317 --> 14:44.579
with my father in the garden,

14:44.622 --> 14:46.798
so I know my way
around a wheelbarrow.

14:46.842 --> 14:49.105
Now, you tell me what
you want lifted, carried,

14:49.149 --> 14:50.977
whatever else,
and I'm your guy.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.021
I'll do my best.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.936
Nate is staying
with Mrs. Waller.

14:55.720 --> 14:56.983
And if I were to help out,

14:57.026 --> 14:58.158
that might provide you
with a bit of a break

14:58.201 --> 14:59.159
should you find yourself

14:59.202 --> 15:01.161
working on
Mrs. Waller's gardens.

15:01.204 --> 15:02.249
You're doing
Mrs. Waller's gardens?

15:02.292 --> 15:03.467
No.

15:03.511 --> 15:04.468
Possibly.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.427
-I told you...
-And I heard,

15:06.470 --> 15:07.863
but don't you want
to do landscape design?

15:07.907 --> 15:09.082
Yes, well, she does.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.083
I do.

15:10.126 --> 15:12.172
Then you have
to start sometime.

15:12.215 --> 15:13.477
He's got a point.

15:13.521 --> 15:14.478
But...

15:14.522 --> 15:15.566
Can you give us a moment?

15:15.610 --> 15:16.828
Yes, of course.

15:19.222 --> 15:20.354
Do you trust him?

15:20.397 --> 15:21.790
I don't really know him.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.400
Mrs. Waller trusts him.

15:23.444 --> 15:25.794
And he seems super-eager
to be helpful.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.883
Well,
we need helpful right now,

15:27.927 --> 15:29.667
and we don't have
a lot of options.

15:32.279 --> 15:34.368
Tomorrow morning,
7:00 a.m.?

15:34.411 --> 15:35.978
Wonderful!

15:54.823 --> 15:55.824
Excuse me?

15:56.912 --> 15:59.175
Have you seen this man?

16:12.580 --> 16:13.842
Am I crazy,

16:13.885 --> 16:16.758
or has our Monday shipment
been put away already?

16:16.801 --> 16:17.977
Yeah. Nate did it.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.761
He's been going full
steam ahead all morning.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.676
Your dad
will be relieved.

16:26.942 --> 16:30.032
Oh, and as promised...

16:30.076 --> 16:32.339
one clean handkerchief.

16:32.382 --> 16:33.209
Thank you.

16:33.253 --> 16:35.255
You're welcome.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.734
Good job today.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.214
Thanks!

16:38.258 --> 16:40.042
I had a great time.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.652
You need
to get out more.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.657
So I spoke
with Mrs. Waller,

16:46.701 --> 16:50.792
and she has time tomorrow
afternoon to chat...

16:50.835 --> 16:51.923
just a chat,

16:51.967 --> 16:53.055
and a chance
to look at the gardens.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.056
No pressure.

16:55.753 --> 16:56.711
Okay.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.539
-Yes?
-Yes.

16:58.582 --> 17:01.237
It's an opportunity,
and I'm grateful.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.847
Nervous, but grateful.

17:04.848 --> 17:06.547
Oh, you have, um...

17:06.589 --> 17:07.852
dirt.

17:07.896 --> 17:08.679
Oh.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.637
Right here.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.297
[camera clicking]

17:21.474 --> 17:22.476
Thank you.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.042
Uh...

17:24.086 --> 17:25.957
After you,
Miss Truitt.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.611
Thank you.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.503
[John]:
So...

17:49.546 --> 17:51.766
have you come
to your senses?

17:51.809 --> 17:53.420
[groaning]

17:53.463 --> 17:56.553
I moved pallets of soil,
more than I can count.

17:56.597 --> 17:58.555
Got scratched up
by rose thorns.

17:58.599 --> 17:59.774
Every muscle aches,

17:59.817 --> 18:01.819
and look, I'm developing
a callus.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.212
See?

18:03.256 --> 18:04.126
Good.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.301
Yeah.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.434
It was an absurd idea
from the outset,

18:07.477 --> 18:09.131
and if your mother
found out,

18:09.175 --> 18:10.611
she would have my head.

18:10.654 --> 18:11.699
No doubt.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.744
All right, I'm going
to take a shower,

18:13.788 --> 18:15.181
but there's
a 50-50 chance

18:15.224 --> 18:17.357
I might pass out on the bed
before I do so.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.881
Please make sure I'm up
by 6:00 a.m.

18:21.535 --> 18:22.710
Why?

18:22.753 --> 18:25.756
I don't want to be late
for my second day.

18:31.719 --> 18:32.633
[Gib]:
Oh, this is decaf, isn't it?

18:32.676 --> 18:36.202
Last thing you need
is caffeine.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.942
But that's where
the fun is.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.206
Fun, like a trip
to the hospital.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.905
Well, don't you
look professional?

18:43.948 --> 18:45.124
You think?

18:45.167 --> 18:46.037
It doesn't look
like I'm trying too hard?

18:46.081 --> 18:48.170
Oh, not at all.
You look lovely.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.564
Thanks.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.479
So is Nate and Avery
at the store?

18:52.522 --> 18:54.089
He's meeting me
at Mrs. Waller's.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.221
Oh, speaking of Nate,

18:55.264 --> 18:57.223
I've invited him
for supper on Friday.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.486
Well, he's been working
so hard,

18:59.529 --> 19:01.618
and it'll give your dad
a chance

19:01.662 --> 19:03.620
to get to know him better.

19:03.664 --> 19:05.709
Or I could go to the store.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.407
No, you're not going
to the store.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.408
[Susanna]: Okay,
I have to go.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.539
Wish me luck.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.106
-Luck!
-Okay. Thank you.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.255
Good morning.

19:29.298 --> 19:30.734
Good morning.

19:30.778 --> 19:32.388
Um...

19:32.432 --> 19:35.391
I'm here to see Nate
and Mrs. Waller.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.393
You're Susanna Truitt?

19:37.437 --> 19:38.481
Yeah.

19:38.525 --> 19:39.482
Interesting.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.571
[Nate]:
Susanna, hello!

19:41.615 --> 19:43.660
I see you met John.

19:43.704 --> 19:44.922
Old mate
from the navy.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.228
He doesn't really
talk much.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.969
Mrs. Waller's
just out back here.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.100
Did you find
the place all right?

19:49.144 --> 19:50.058
Yeah, it's
beautiful.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.278
Here we are.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.370
How nice to see
you again, Susanna.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.675
You as well.
Thank you.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.808
Susanna was valedictorian
at St. Simons High

20:00.851 --> 20:02.592
the year
I was commencement speaker.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.464
I didn't think
you'd remember me.

20:04.507 --> 20:05.682
Of course, dear.

20:05.726 --> 20:08.903
It was my honor to share
the stage with you.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.078
Tea?

20:10.121 --> 20:11.514
Please, yes,
thank you.

20:11.558 --> 20:14.082
[Mrs. Waller]:
So, what do you think?

20:14.125 --> 20:16.215
I think it's not
a seaside garden,

20:16.258 --> 20:17.694
not in the way
it should be.

20:17.738 --> 20:18.956
What do you mean?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.611
Seaside gardens are supposed
to be so romantic,

20:21.655 --> 20:23.352
and you're supposed
to work in harmony

20:23.396 --> 20:25.615
with the nature
that's around them.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.095
In what way?

20:27.138 --> 20:28.792
Well, there should be
dune grass,

20:28.836 --> 20:30.229
and lavender,
and sage,

20:30.272 --> 20:32.840
and this garden doesn't
have any of that.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.668
Kind of feels
constricted, you know?

20:34.711 --> 20:37.061
It feels like there should be
some more space.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.149
I would start,

20:38.193 --> 20:39.063
and I would take out
that white fencing

20:39.107 --> 20:40.195
right there.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.849
Here, I can actually
show you.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.242
Oh, yes.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.375
You see, these drawings,

20:46.419 --> 20:47.942
these sketches
are a little more natural,

20:47.985 --> 20:50.379
and we could use the
actual grade of the land

20:50.423 --> 20:53.121
as it goes down
to the sea, too.

20:53.164 --> 20:55.123
These are wonderful.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.559
Well, thank you.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.257
I obviously did them
before I saw your actual garden.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.302
But you can do this?

21:00.346 --> 21:01.521
Yeah.

21:01.564 --> 21:03.740
Well then,
don't let me stop you.

21:03.784 --> 21:04.741
I have a trip to Europe

21:04.785 --> 21:05.873
next week,

21:05.916 --> 21:08.441
but you will have
any and all access

21:08.484 --> 21:10.181
to supplies.

21:10.225 --> 21:12.009
So, Susanna
has the job?

21:12.053 --> 21:13.054
Yes.

21:13.097 --> 21:14.316
Didn't I make that clear?

21:14.360 --> 21:15.883
Thank you!
Thank you.

21:15.926 --> 21:16.971
I promise,

21:17.014 --> 21:17.885
I will make them
perfect and beautiful

21:17.928 --> 21:18.973
for you.

21:19.016 --> 21:20.931
I have all the faith
in the world.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.193
Thank you.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.067
To fate.

21:26.894 --> 21:27.851
To Fate.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.766
[laughing]

21:39.602 --> 21:41.735
So... that's
Ms. Truitt.

21:41.778 --> 21:44.651
It explains so much.

21:45.913 --> 21:47.218
I don't know
what you mean.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.614
[John]: You haven't thought
this through, Nate.

21:54.051 --> 21:55.009
These are my last days
of freedom

21:55.052 --> 21:56.793
before everything changes.

21:59.056 --> 22:02.103
You run the risk
of heartbreak...

22:02.146 --> 22:03.626
for the both of you.

22:11.808 --> 22:13.897
[Susanna]:
I like this one down there.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.377
This one?
Okay.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.378
So... yeah.

22:16.422 --> 22:17.379
So these two here?

22:17.423 --> 22:18.424
Yeah, I think
let's do them both.

22:18.467 --> 22:19.642
Okay, perfect.

22:19.686 --> 22:20.643
Thank you.

22:20.687 --> 22:21.862
Yeah, you do
the heavy lifting.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.124
I like...
oh, that guy's really good

22:23.167 --> 22:24.168
'cause it smells so good.

22:24.212 --> 22:24.995
This one?

22:25.039 --> 22:26.214
Yeah. It's good.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.171
Smells very nice.

22:27.215 --> 22:28.259
I know.
Okay, um...

22:28.303 --> 22:29.913
These-- these
are pretty, yeah?

22:29.957 --> 22:31.350
Yeah.

22:32.612 --> 22:33.656
That's all right,
I'm just kidding.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.050
Just grab it.

22:36.093 --> 22:37.051
I am.

22:37.094 --> 22:37.965
Are you sure?

22:38.008 --> 22:38.966
Careful,
they're fragile.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.403
You put them down, then.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.362
You have to put them
down then. Yes.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.102
Plant the perennials.

22:45.146 --> 22:45.973
Perennials?

22:46.016 --> 22:47.235
What do they
look like?

22:47.278 --> 22:49.629
Um, they're
all different things, really.

22:49.672 --> 22:50.847
Really?

22:50.891 --> 22:52.806
These all different--
All right.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.198
Perfect.

22:54.242 --> 22:55.417
Can't wait to see what
you're going to do here.

23:05.775 --> 23:07.951
You're pretty
good at this.

23:07.995 --> 23:10.737
I didn't go to college
for nothing.

23:32.846 --> 23:34.151
[Gib]: So you were in the navy?

23:34.195 --> 23:36.458
I was.

23:36.502 --> 23:37.590
And so,
are you retired,

23:37.633 --> 23:39.113
or how does that work
over there?

23:39.156 --> 23:40.984
Ah, well, technically,

23:41.028 --> 23:43.596
I'm still part
of the service.

23:43.639 --> 23:46.033
Once a navy man,
always a navy man.

23:46.076 --> 23:47.730
Indeed.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.210
So, Nate, have
you had a chance

23:49.253 --> 23:50.472
to see much
of St. Simons?

23:50.516 --> 23:53.475
Susanna's got him
working too much.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.042
For which I'm grateful.

23:55.085 --> 23:56.086
Well, you have
the weirdest idea

23:56.130 --> 23:57.348
of a vacation.

23:57.392 --> 23:58.698
A respite away
from my everyday life....

23:58.741 --> 24:00.917
and this most certainly
has been that,

24:00.961 --> 24:03.442
but to your point,
Mrs. Truitt...

24:03.485 --> 24:06.096
-Glo.
-Glo.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.402
I would very much like

24:07.446 --> 24:08.708
to see more of your island
before I depart.

24:08.751 --> 24:12.494
Susanna could give you
a bike tour.

24:12.538 --> 24:13.626
You still remember
how to do that,

24:13.669 --> 24:14.888
don't you, Suse?

24:14.931 --> 24:16.411
Susanna used to help
give bike tours

24:16.455 --> 24:17.847
around St. Simons

24:17.891 --> 24:21.416
back when she was competing
to be the Peach Princess.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.331
I'm sorry,
the Peach Princess?

24:23.374 --> 24:24.767
Mm-hmm, in high school,

24:24.811 --> 24:28.510
Susie won the local
Peach Princess Beauty Contest

24:28.554 --> 24:29.903
and she became kind
of an ambassador

24:29.946 --> 24:30.904
for St. Simons

24:30.947 --> 24:31.905
for a whole year.

24:31.948 --> 24:33.907
She was adorable.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.517
I bet she was.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.259
[Gib]: Okay, can we get back
to talking 'bout the Navy now?

24:38.302 --> 24:39.260
Please?

24:39.303 --> 24:40.870
Yes, absolutely...

24:40.914 --> 24:43.133
um... as soon as
I help clear the table?

24:43.177 --> 24:44.526
Would that be
all right?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.791
So should I be calling you
the Peach Princess?

24:48.835 --> 24:50.184
Is that your official title?

24:50.227 --> 24:51.707
I was 16.

24:51.751 --> 24:53.709
You have to understand,
it was family tradition.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.102
I had to enter
the contest.

24:55.145 --> 24:57.147
Actually, I do understand.

24:57.191 --> 24:58.322
Family tradition
is very important

24:58.366 --> 25:00.150
where I come from as well.

25:00.194 --> 25:01.369
Then you get it.

25:01.412 --> 25:02.718
I do,

25:02.762 --> 25:03.850
and in all sincerity,

25:03.893 --> 25:05.242
a bike tour
sounds wonderful,

25:05.286 --> 25:06.548
if you can spare the time.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.332
I think I can swing it.

25:08.376 --> 25:09.246
Wonderful.

25:09.290 --> 25:10.073
I'll see you at work.

25:10.117 --> 25:11.684
Yeah.

25:22.564 --> 25:23.870
It's out.

25:29.179 --> 25:30.267
[Avery]:
Susanna!

25:30.311 --> 25:32.705
You are so not
going to believe this!

25:32.748 --> 25:33.706
Believe what?

25:33.749 --> 25:36.273
Who Nate really is!

25:54.465 --> 25:56.555
Oh, thank you, Steven.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.217
Oh, Nathaniel...

26:27.977 --> 26:29.109
Susanna!

26:30.371 --> 26:31.981
You're a prince?

26:32.025 --> 26:33.243
Oh, you saw.

26:33.287 --> 26:34.549
Yeah...
I saw.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.550
I can explain.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.856
Is your explanation,

26:36.899 --> 26:38.422
"I'm a prince
and it slipped my mind"?

26:38.466 --> 26:39.772
Would you believe that?

26:39.815 --> 26:41.164
Yeah, actually, I would.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.165
You know,
'cause it happens all the time.

26:42.209 --> 26:43.166
It does?

26:43.210 --> 26:44.167
No!

26:44.211 --> 26:45.560
Right...
stupid me, um...

26:47.301 --> 26:48.607
Would you allow me
to explain?

26:54.700 --> 26:57.790
I'm sorry for not telling you
who I really was.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.618
Anonymity is so rare for me,

26:59.661 --> 27:02.882
and so I think I held onto it
a bit too long.

27:04.100 --> 27:07.060
In many ways, being here
where no one recognizes me

27:07.103 --> 27:09.802
has been such a blessing...

27:09.845 --> 27:11.847
especially now.

27:11.891 --> 27:14.371
Why now?

27:14.415 --> 27:18.288
This will be
my last real holiday.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.726
My father passed away
a few months ago

27:20.769 --> 27:22.945
most unexpectedly.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.817
I'm so sorry
about your father.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.470
Thank you.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.690
He was a great man,

27:28.734 --> 27:30.736
and an unbelievable king.

27:30.779 --> 27:33.042
It'll be hard to follow
in his footsteps.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.696
I think that
you can do it.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.352
What makes you so certain?

27:38.395 --> 27:39.440
Well, I don't know much

27:39.483 --> 27:40.659
about what it takes
to be a king,

27:40.702 --> 27:43.052
but I do know
a lot about people,

27:43.096 --> 27:44.619
and I've seen
how hardworking

27:44.663 --> 27:46.708
and generous
and kind you are,

27:46.752 --> 27:48.362
so...

27:48.405 --> 27:51.278
I think the people of Cambria
would be very lucky to have you.

27:54.194 --> 27:55.238
That might be
the best compliment

27:55.282 --> 27:56.500
I have ever been given.

27:59.025 --> 28:00.635
If I might return
the favor...

28:02.811 --> 28:03.856
I know
your life hasn't gone

28:03.899 --> 28:04.944
exactly
as you'd thought.

28:05.945 --> 28:07.598
That's an understatement.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.122
But...

28:09.165 --> 28:11.080
you're the sort
of smart and resourceful person

28:11.124 --> 28:12.342
that'll make the most

28:12.386 --> 28:13.909
of any circumstance
you find yourself in.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.217
Thank you.

28:19.741 --> 28:23.136
So, a prince, huh?

28:23.179 --> 28:25.834
What's it like to just
be watched all the time?

28:25.878 --> 28:27.662
You grow accustomed
to it.

28:27.706 --> 28:28.968
No, for me,
the hardest part

28:29.011 --> 28:30.926
is having decisions
made for me,

28:30.970 --> 28:33.059
sometimes even
before I was born.

28:33.102 --> 28:35.148
Like what?

28:35.191 --> 28:36.323
Where I'll go
to university...

28:36.366 --> 28:38.368
Naval Academy.

28:38.412 --> 28:39.543
My area of study...

28:39.587 --> 28:43.373
political science,
civil engineering, law.

28:43.417 --> 28:45.549
Whom I'll marry.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.551
You have arranged
marriages?

28:47.595 --> 28:49.640
No, but...

28:49.684 --> 28:50.772
when I do marry,

28:50.816 --> 28:53.166
I must marry a woman
from Cambria.

28:53.209 --> 28:54.384
Must?

28:54.428 --> 28:56.299
It's tradition.

28:57.387 --> 29:00.086
Anyone in mind?

29:01.478 --> 29:04.830
Names are always
being floated...

29:04.873 --> 29:06.614
one more than others.

29:11.227 --> 29:12.751
[reporters]: Lady Ginny!

29:15.971 --> 29:17.451
Lady Ginny, this way!

29:17.494 --> 29:20.323
Did he tell you anything
about this relationship?

29:20.367 --> 29:22.021
How many women has it been now?

29:27.287 --> 29:28.810
What are you up to now, Morris?

29:34.598 --> 29:36.339
Lady Ginny!
Lady Ginny!

29:37.688 --> 29:38.689
[Susanna]: He's a prince, Dad!

29:38.733 --> 29:39.821
He's, like,
the real thing.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.258
And he's been
hauling mulch for us!

29:44.391 --> 29:45.653
Okay, Nate is coming.

29:45.696 --> 29:46.872
I told him we were
going to play it cool.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.311
Hi, honey...

29:51.354 --> 29:52.312
I mean, uh...

29:52.355 --> 29:54.053
It's all right.
Hon' is fine.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.447
I wanted to apologize to you

29:57.491 --> 30:00.146
for not being forthright
about my identity.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.148
You've all been so giving,

30:02.191 --> 30:05.586
and I really appreciate being
treated just like a normal...

30:05.629 --> 30:06.979
No need to
apologize, hon'.

30:07.022 --> 30:09.764
You are too kind,

30:09.808 --> 30:13.942
Now, I wish that I could
continue working here

30:13.986 --> 30:17.250
because it's been truly fun...

30:18.642 --> 30:20.166
[clearing throat]

30:20.209 --> 30:21.645
But now that
my secret is out,

30:21.689 --> 30:22.908
that is quite
impossible.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.474
Well...

30:24.518 --> 30:27.521
Nate, you've already done
so much.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.088
And we can get
someone else

30:29.131 --> 30:30.741
to cover when
my dad's recovering.

30:32.178 --> 30:34.920
I know this is a little late
at this point,

30:34.963 --> 30:36.051
but...

30:37.139 --> 30:38.401
Gib and I got this
made up for you.

30:49.804 --> 30:52.024
Thank you...

30:52.067 --> 30:53.634
all of you.

30:58.421 --> 31:00.989
I'm going to miss this place.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.861
We're going
to miss you.

31:05.776 --> 31:08.083
Oh, we never got
that bike tour.

31:08.127 --> 31:10.912
Well, are you leaving
town right away?

31:10.956 --> 31:12.522
Day after tomorrow.

31:12.566 --> 31:15.003
So, what are you
doing right now?

31:20.443 --> 31:22.663
Let's do it.

31:39.506 --> 31:40.507
Here we are.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.335
Yeah.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.037
Isn't that the tree
where we first met?

31:49.081 --> 31:50.343
Yeah, exactly.

31:50.386 --> 31:51.561
Oh, well, come on.

31:51.605 --> 31:53.172
Let's stop here.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.933
So beautiful.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.023
[Nate]: Now, the day we met,

32:18.066 --> 32:19.981
that was a great day, but...

32:20.025 --> 32:21.635
in all my life,

32:21.678 --> 32:24.551
I've never had a day
like today.

32:24.594 --> 32:26.640
I feel...

32:26.683 --> 32:28.729
free.

32:28.772 --> 32:31.123
Is that a good thing?

32:31.166 --> 32:32.515
The best.

32:32.559 --> 32:34.039
Thank you.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.956
Could you be
something else...

32:37.999 --> 32:39.392
other than a prince?

32:40.871 --> 32:42.438
I'll be king soon.

32:42.482 --> 32:45.354
I know that.
I just mean...

32:45.398 --> 32:46.355
When I first met you,

32:46.399 --> 32:47.574
you seemed so eager
to help.

32:47.617 --> 32:49.750
You even volunteered
at the store.

32:49.793 --> 32:52.187
Why?

32:52.231 --> 32:54.146
The real reason.

32:54.189 --> 32:57.845
The chance to lead
a normal life...

32:57.888 --> 32:59.934
just for a few days.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.851
The chance to make
my own decisions.

33:03.894 --> 33:05.026
Royalty has evolved

33:05.070 --> 33:09.030
into a mostly
ceremonial position.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.379
Ceremonies
are theatre.

33:13.252 --> 33:14.427
For some time now,
I've felt

33:14.470 --> 33:16.864
as if I was a prop
in someone else's life.

33:18.387 --> 33:20.389
Will that change
when you become king?

33:20.433 --> 33:23.610
I certainly hope so.

33:23.653 --> 33:25.046
I'm sure it will.

33:26.874 --> 33:29.920
So what's the first thing
you're going to do as king?

33:29.964 --> 33:32.358
Open the Florentine
Gardens to the public.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.447
They're so beautiful,
they should be shared...

33:34.490 --> 33:36.144
I mean, especially once
Sir Edward's finished

33:36.188 --> 33:38.146
renovating
the South Oval.

33:38.190 --> 33:39.234
Sir Edward?

33:39.278 --> 33:40.235
Tilbury. He's...

33:40.279 --> 33:42.237
Yeah, he's amazing!

33:42.281 --> 33:43.325
I studied his work
in college.

33:43.369 --> 33:44.761
I thought he'd retired.

33:44.805 --> 33:46.198
He had,

33:46.241 --> 33:48.200
but my mother is very
good at getting her way.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.723
Wow.

33:49.766 --> 33:50.898
[laughing]

33:52.465 --> 33:54.945
I wish you could
see the gardens.

33:54.989 --> 33:55.903
You'd love them.

33:57.774 --> 33:58.993
Maybe someday.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.648
I certainly hope so.

34:06.696 --> 34:08.176
We should probably
get going.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.091
Yeah, right.

34:28.849 --> 34:30.068
I can't figure
this out.

34:30.110 --> 34:31.069
It's all right.
I got it.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.722
[camera clicking]

34:35.290 --> 34:36.291
You coming?

34:36.335 --> 34:37.771
Eventually.

34:41.208 --> 34:42.906
[phone ringing]

34:46.822 --> 34:48.129
Lady Ginny?

34:48.172 --> 34:49.435
What a surprise.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.393
Someone's been busy.

34:51.437 --> 34:54.004
And making a profit.

34:54.047 --> 34:55.614
So I've seen.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.704
So everyone has seen.

34:57.747 --> 34:59.532
Here's the thing, Morris.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.534
Remember how I pulled in
a few favors with the Queen

35:01.577 --> 35:04.406
to get you
into the royal press pool?

35:04.450 --> 35:05.799
Yeah...

35:05.842 --> 35:07.975
Then you also know
how very much you owe me,

35:08.018 --> 35:10.630
Now, Morris...

35:10.673 --> 35:13.763
are there any other surprises
you'd like to tell me about?

35:14.982 --> 35:17.158
[John]:
According to your mother,

35:17.202 --> 35:19.421
Lady Ginny was just able
to stop Morris Alderman

35:19.465 --> 35:21.380
from publishing this.

35:25.601 --> 35:26.559
I'm sorry, Nate,

35:26.602 --> 35:28.343
but the Queen
was quite clear.

35:28.387 --> 35:29.692
The flight leaves
in three hours,

35:29.736 --> 35:31.607
and your bags are
already packed.

35:34.741 --> 35:35.742
We must leave now.

35:42.314 --> 35:43.750
[line ringing]

35:44.751 --> 35:46.056
[rings]

35:48.929 --> 35:50.191
[dryer blowing]

35:51.236 --> 35:53.325
[voice mail]:
Hey, it's Susanna.

35:53.368 --> 35:55.631
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you ASAP.

36:02.508 --> 36:04.988
Hey, Susanna, it's Nate.

36:05.032 --> 36:07.077
Bit of bad news.

36:07.121 --> 36:10.080
I have to return home
immediately.

36:10.124 --> 36:12.518
I'm so sorry I couldn't
say goodbye in person.

36:25.226 --> 36:26.662
Evie Jones is
at the register.

36:26.706 --> 36:27.707
She wants to talk to you.

36:29.012 --> 36:30.013
Oh.

36:32.799 --> 36:33.756
Hi, Evie.

36:33.800 --> 36:34.757
What's up?

36:34.801 --> 36:36.759
Are the rumors true?

36:36.803 --> 36:39.240
Yes, we had a prince
working for us.

36:39.284 --> 36:40.546
No, he is no longer here.

36:40.589 --> 36:42.069
Oh, not about him.

36:43.636 --> 36:45.203
That you're redoing
Mrs. Waller's gardens?

36:46.204 --> 36:47.379
Uh, yeah...

36:47.422 --> 36:49.250
yeah, that's true,
actually.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.904
Congratulations.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.601
Thank you.

36:52.645 --> 36:54.777
Are you available
to do some work on my gardens

36:54.821 --> 36:55.822
when you're done?

36:57.693 --> 36:59.217
I'd love to.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.218
Wonderful.

37:00.261 --> 37:01.219
Thank you.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.611
Of course!
Thank you.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.809
Thank you.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.207
There will be
a few hours

37:33.251 --> 37:36.776
between the coronation
and the coronation ball.

37:36.819 --> 37:38.212
Is there anything
in particular

37:38.256 --> 37:40.301
you'd like to include
in the itinerary

37:40.345 --> 37:42.434
after the morning's
walkthrough?

37:42.477 --> 37:45.567
Is my son dreaming
about America...

37:45.611 --> 37:47.743
or one American
in particular?

37:47.787 --> 37:49.049
Thank you, John.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.355
Hello, Mother.

37:50.398 --> 37:51.660
Hello, darling.

37:55.185 --> 37:56.186
Good flight?

37:56.230 --> 37:58.058
Good enough.

37:58.101 --> 37:59.233
What's this?

37:59.277 --> 38:01.844
This is your grandmother's
engagement ring.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.716
It's time you started

38:03.759 --> 38:06.501
to think about your life
after the coronation.

38:06.545 --> 38:08.373
This is quite
a way off.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.070
Not as far
as you might think,

38:10.113 --> 38:12.333
and Lady Ginny has
proven herself

38:12.377 --> 38:13.421
quite useful of late.

38:13.465 --> 38:14.988
Not that again,
Mother.

38:15.031 --> 38:16.598
You must choose someone.

38:16.642 --> 38:19.166
It cannot be
the American.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.167
Remind me again why.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.342
[laughing]

38:21.386 --> 38:23.344
You know why.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.041
Tradition...

38:25.085 --> 38:26.129
and to be fair,

38:26.173 --> 38:28.349
the girl has
absolutely no preparation

38:28.393 --> 38:30.264
for a role
such as this.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.961
Few do.

38:32.005 --> 38:34.355
And is this where you remind me
that Ginny does?

38:34.399 --> 38:35.922
No need.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.273
Most of all,
Nathaniel,

38:39.317 --> 38:40.970
you must always remember

38:41.014 --> 38:42.711
that you are to be
the King of Cambria.

38:44.191 --> 38:45.497
There are enough doubts

38:45.540 --> 38:46.802
about the role
of the monarchy

38:46.846 --> 38:48.238
in the modern era

38:48.282 --> 38:49.414
as is.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.503
We would be
beyond foolish

38:51.546 --> 38:53.548
to invite more trouble,

38:53.592 --> 38:55.811
and we are not foolish.

38:57.639 --> 38:59.249
Now, I have
a very boring meeting

38:59.293 --> 39:01.469
with the Prime Minister,

39:01.513 --> 39:03.036
but you'll be pleased
to know...

39:03.079 --> 39:06.387
I have invited Lady Ginny
for tea.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.147
Hello, darling.

39:27.190 --> 39:29.715
Ginny...
what a surprise.

39:31.412 --> 39:32.892
I wasn't certain you'd
make it back in time

39:32.935 --> 39:35.024
for your big day.

39:35.068 --> 39:36.591
I was only gone
a couple of weeks.

39:36.635 --> 39:38.288
A lot can happen
in a few weeks,

39:38.332 --> 39:40.769
and apparently did.

39:40.813 --> 39:42.945
Ginny, you're always
best when you're direct,

39:42.989 --> 39:43.946
so please...

39:43.990 --> 39:46.340
let me have it.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.516
I merely wanted
to see how you were doing

39:48.560 --> 39:49.952
after your trip
to America.

39:49.996 --> 39:51.998
Rumors are swirling

39:52.041 --> 39:54.435
that our future king
is perhaps distracted.

39:55.871 --> 39:57.133
Anything in particular,

39:57.177 --> 39:59.222
or... anyone?

39:59.266 --> 40:00.963
Well...

40:01.007 --> 40:04.184
I do have this rather large
event on the horizon.

40:04.227 --> 40:06.665
The coronation ball.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.275
You do remember how to dance,
don't you?

40:08.318 --> 40:10.059
I do, but...

40:10.103 --> 40:13.193
there's also
the actual coronation.

40:13.236 --> 40:14.586
Oh, that.

40:14.629 --> 40:16.283
You'll get through that
with ease,

40:16.326 --> 40:18.633
but should you need help,

40:18.677 --> 40:19.765
you know perfectly well

40:19.808 --> 40:21.636
there's no one else
who understands you

40:21.680 --> 40:23.290
quite like I do,

40:23.333 --> 40:24.552
and who also knows

40:24.596 --> 40:27.990
how to navigate the nuances
of royal politics.

40:28.034 --> 40:29.122
I'm quite unique.

40:29.165 --> 40:31.472
That you are.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.126
Tea?

40:33.169 --> 40:35.607
Please.

40:40.786 --> 40:42.091
Aw....

40:42.135 --> 40:43.919
looks real nice, honey.

40:43.963 --> 40:45.530
Thank you.

40:45.573 --> 40:48.097
I just want it to all be done
when Mrs. Waller gets back.

40:48.141 --> 40:49.534
It's going to be perfect.

40:52.406 --> 40:53.363
Is everything okay?

40:53.407 --> 40:54.756
Something
on your mind?

40:54.800 --> 40:56.671
Dr. Miller gave your father
the go-ahead

40:56.715 --> 40:57.846
to return to the store
full-time.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.152
That's great.

40:59.195 --> 41:00.675
Well, not
if he goes back

41:00.719 --> 41:02.547
to working
the same crazy amount.

41:02.590 --> 41:03.939
I mean,

41:03.983 --> 41:05.506
having Nate help us
like he did

41:05.550 --> 41:06.638
just made it
more obvious...

41:06.681 --> 41:10.424
we need to hire
a couple more people...

41:10.468 --> 41:13.166
especially now that
your landscaping's taking off.

41:13.209 --> 41:15.168
Mom, it's just Mrs. Waller
and Evie Jones.

41:15.211 --> 41:16.169
That's it.

41:16.212 --> 41:18.258
It's a start.

41:18.301 --> 41:19.259
Folks like

41:19.302 --> 41:20.434
that you're Mrs. Waller's
choice,

41:20.478 --> 41:21.479
and it's just going
to grow from there.

41:23.176 --> 41:24.351
I hope so.

41:24.394 --> 41:25.570
I know so.

41:25.613 --> 41:28.921
You're made
for bigger things, Susie.

41:28.964 --> 41:30.662
I've always felt that.

41:32.272 --> 41:33.578
Thank you.

41:33.621 --> 41:34.753
I love you.

41:36.450 --> 41:38.496
[John]: Some bills
from the Prime Minister

41:38.539 --> 41:39.845
for you to sign, ma'am.

41:39.888 --> 41:43.065
I'll e-mail your secretary
the security updates.

41:43.109 --> 41:44.937
[Queen]: Nathaniel hasn't been
the same since he's returned.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.939
I recognize that look,

41:46.982 --> 41:48.462
and so do the gossip pages.

41:50.725 --> 41:54.555
Nathaniel is to be crowned
King of Cambria within ten days.

41:54.599 --> 41:55.643
As such, he is required

41:55.687 --> 41:58.385
to marry a woman
of Cambrian descent.

41:58.428 --> 42:00.474
I want him to be happy,
not hurt...

42:00.518 --> 42:03.564
not harboring some delusion

42:03.608 --> 42:04.957
of a young girl
who could never fit in.

42:06.088 --> 42:07.220
Perhaps he should see that.

42:07.263 --> 42:08.656
What do you mean?

42:08.700 --> 42:11.398
At the moment,
Ms. Truitt is an ideal,

42:11.441 --> 42:15.097
the personification of
all that he cannot have.

42:15.141 --> 42:18.100
That's due in part
to the romanticized circumstance

42:18.144 --> 42:19.493
in which they were together.

42:20.886 --> 42:22.714
And your suggestion is?

42:22.757 --> 42:25.412
Change the circumstance.

42:25.455 --> 42:26.935
Bring her to Cambria.

42:26.979 --> 42:29.938
Allow him to see her
in a new role.

42:29.982 --> 42:31.157
Shatter the illusion?

42:33.159 --> 42:35.422
That could work.

42:35.465 --> 42:37.598
I think we might have
to take it one step further...

42:37.642 --> 42:39.687
show him without question

42:39.731 --> 42:41.602
that she could never be
Queen of Cambria.

42:41.646 --> 42:43.517
I think I have an idea
of how to do it...

42:45.388 --> 42:47.086
and you're going
to help me, John.

42:47.129 --> 42:48.914
Of course, ma'am.

42:48.957 --> 42:51.046
Anything you need.

42:56.922 --> 42:58.706
An apprentice?

42:58.750 --> 43:00.795
To Sir Edward Tilbury.

43:00.839 --> 43:02.710
Who's that?

43:02.754 --> 43:03.842
He's the most famous
landscape architect

43:03.885 --> 43:04.973
in the entire world.

43:05.017 --> 43:08.063
And he wants you
to apprentice for him?

43:08.107 --> 43:10.239
[Susanna]: I feel like Nate
probably pulled some strings

43:10.283 --> 43:11.327
because I know he's working

43:11.371 --> 43:13.199
in the Florentine Gardens
in Cambria.

43:13.242 --> 43:14.679
Well, it says here

43:14.722 --> 43:17.290
that it's only until
Nate's coronation.

43:17.333 --> 43:19.335
That's next week.

43:19.379 --> 43:21.599
I bet you get
an invitation to go.

43:21.642 --> 43:22.817
I want to go!

43:22.861 --> 43:23.949
Okay, calm down.

43:23.992 --> 43:24.819
I don't even know
if I'm going to go

43:24.863 --> 43:26.647
What are you talking about?

43:26.691 --> 43:27.866
Of course you're going to go.

43:27.909 --> 43:29.345
Well,
what about the store?

43:29.389 --> 43:30.433
I mean,
who's going to cover?

43:31.652 --> 43:33.306
Well, I'm back,

43:33.349 --> 43:35.395
and Uncle Lonnie said
he would help.

43:35.438 --> 43:37.789
And I'll go with Susanna,

43:37.832 --> 43:40.487
so she's not all alone...

43:40.530 --> 43:42.924
in a foreign
country...

43:42.968 --> 43:43.969
[squealing]

43:44.012 --> 43:45.492
where we know royalty!

43:54.066 --> 43:55.328
It's gorgeous.

43:59.854 --> 44:01.639
-We're here.
-I'm so excited!

44:04.642 --> 44:08.123
I can't wait to see
our castle rooms.

44:08.167 --> 44:09.647
It's so pretty.

44:21.963 --> 44:23.486
Thank you.

44:35.977 --> 44:37.544
This is not how I pictured it.

44:37.587 --> 44:40.721
Well, this is
the employee quarters.

44:40.765 --> 44:43.811
You think you could call Nate
to get us an upgrade?

44:43.855 --> 44:45.683
I'm sure Nate knows we're here.

44:45.726 --> 44:46.901
He's just...
he's busy.

44:46.945 --> 44:48.903
He'll call us
when he can.

44:48.947 --> 44:49.904
Besides,

44:49.948 --> 44:51.558
I have to get to work.

44:52.994 --> 44:54.039
Fine.

44:54.082 --> 44:55.867
You go do that...

44:55.910 --> 44:58.130
while I go shopping!

45:15.800 --> 45:17.932
Um, Sir Edward?

45:17.976 --> 45:19.586
Hi, I'm Susanna Truitt.

45:19.629 --> 45:21.719
Ah, the American.

45:21.762 --> 45:22.720
Yes.

45:22.763 --> 45:23.721
Um...

45:23.764 --> 45:25.897
yes, I am American...

45:28.856 --> 45:30.031
but I just wanted to say,

45:30.075 --> 45:32.425
I am so honored to be
working with you.

45:32.468 --> 45:33.426
This is just
a dream come...

45:33.469 --> 45:35.254
Yes, well,
take this.

45:35.297 --> 45:36.777
Down the path,
round the corner,

45:36.821 --> 45:37.865
and clean that area.

45:37.909 --> 45:40.085
Okay, um...

45:40.128 --> 45:41.086
I just...

45:41.129 --> 45:42.914
Well, get on with it.

45:42.957 --> 45:44.306
Shoo!

46:11.899 --> 46:13.379
Oh!

46:13.422 --> 46:14.859
Hi.

46:14.902 --> 46:16.425
What are you doing?

46:16.469 --> 46:18.340
Uh...

46:19.907 --> 46:21.909
Oh, um...
Your Highness.

46:21.953 --> 46:23.258
Majesty.

46:23.302 --> 46:25.173
Your Majesty.

46:25.217 --> 46:26.958
Ma'am,
may I present to you...

46:27.001 --> 46:29.874
Yes, I know who this is.

46:29.917 --> 46:32.093
You're exactly as I imagined.

46:34.139 --> 46:35.575
I was thinking gooseberries
in that area.

46:35.618 --> 46:36.750
Splendid idea, ma'am.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.274
Yes, I shall instruct
the gardeners to...

46:40.449 --> 46:43.496
I don't understand
why this wasn't on my schedule.

46:43.539 --> 46:45.803
It was a
last-minute addition.

46:45.846 --> 46:47.326
Your mother wanted

46:47.369 --> 46:49.371
to promote
the renovations

46:49.415 --> 46:51.765
as well as
your coronation.

46:51.809 --> 46:54.072
My coronation
hardly needs promotion.

46:56.117 --> 46:58.816
The clothes here are awesome.

46:58.859 --> 47:01.340
We can easily find stuff
to wear for the coronation.

47:01.383 --> 47:03.255
We weren't invited
to the coronation.

47:03.298 --> 47:04.647
We will be.

47:04.691 --> 47:06.911
Nate's not going to ignore us
while we're here.

47:06.954 --> 47:08.477
I'm here to work.

47:08.521 --> 47:09.522
Fine...

47:09.565 --> 47:11.219
but Susie?

47:11.263 --> 47:14.657
They have ball gowns
that are gorgeous!

47:14.701 --> 47:18.096
We weren't invited
to the coronation ball, either.

47:18.139 --> 47:19.532
We will be.

47:19.575 --> 47:20.620
How can you be so sure?

47:20.663 --> 47:21.664
Because it's Nate.

47:22.970 --> 47:25.103
Speaking
of our former hired help,

47:25.146 --> 47:26.582
have you seen him yet?

47:26.626 --> 47:29.324
Because I have questions
about this whole dorm situation.

47:29.368 --> 47:31.065
Remember,
we're guests here, okay,

47:31.109 --> 47:32.240
so when we're in public,

47:32.284 --> 47:33.676
we have to refer to him
as Prince Nath--

47:33.720 --> 47:34.808
[Nate]: Obviously,
it's an earlier time

47:34.852 --> 47:35.896
than I was expecting.

47:35.940 --> 47:37.028
Hold on one second.

47:37.071 --> 47:38.333
Nate?

47:42.947 --> 47:44.339
Hey, I was wondering
when I'd run into you!

47:44.383 --> 47:45.340
Susanna?

47:45.384 --> 47:46.254
Hey!

47:46.298 --> 47:47.342
[cameras clicking]

47:47.386 --> 47:48.604
-Nathaniel.
-Turn this way, darling.

47:48.648 --> 47:50.345
John, handle this.
Come, come...

47:50.389 --> 47:51.825
I'm so sorry...

47:51.869 --> 47:52.870
Okay...

47:52.913 --> 47:54.784
thank you,
that's all for today.

47:57.831 --> 47:58.876
Well, that was embarrassing.

47:58.919 --> 47:59.877
John will make sure

47:59.920 --> 48:01.748
none of those photos
are published.

48:01.791 --> 48:03.663
Thank goodness.

48:03.706 --> 48:05.795
What are you doing
in Cambria?

48:05.839 --> 48:08.276
I'm here for the apprenticeship
with Sir Edward.

48:09.538 --> 48:10.888
The what?

48:10.931 --> 48:12.411
The landscape architecture
apprenticeship.

48:12.454 --> 48:13.978
I thought you put
me up for it?

48:14.021 --> 48:16.676
I don't even know
what it is.

48:16.719 --> 48:17.807
Well then,

48:17.851 --> 48:19.374
you don't know that
Avery's here either?

48:19.418 --> 48:20.854
-She is?
-Yeah.

48:20.898 --> 48:21.942
Well, that's great.

48:21.986 --> 48:23.291
When did you both arrive?

48:23.335 --> 48:24.466
Two days ago.

48:24.510 --> 48:25.641
She's been out sightseeing
and shopping

48:25.685 --> 48:27.121
while I do all the work,

48:27.165 --> 48:28.166
and I'm working
in the new garden.

48:28.209 --> 48:29.471
That's why I
look like...

48:29.515 --> 48:31.734
You look lovely.

48:31.778 --> 48:32.866
Liar.

48:32.910 --> 48:33.867
I bet
you're the prettiest gardener

48:33.911 --> 48:34.912
in the crew.

48:40.091 --> 48:41.614
Wow...

48:43.485 --> 48:46.053
This is beautiful.

48:48.490 --> 48:50.188
Wait,
if you didn't bring me here,

48:50.231 --> 48:52.364
who did, and why?

48:53.495 --> 48:55.584
I may have an idea.

48:57.717 --> 48:59.762
The Queen, yes.

48:59.806 --> 49:00.938
I met her
this morning.

49:00.981 --> 49:02.330
You met my mother?

49:02.374 --> 49:04.071
Mm-hmm.

49:04.115 --> 49:06.508
She's got intimidation
down to an art form, huh?

49:06.552 --> 49:08.510
Yes, she does.

49:08.554 --> 49:10.599
A skill honed
from childhood.

49:10.643 --> 49:11.731
My father always
used to say

49:11.774 --> 49:14.125
that he was king,
but she ruled.

49:15.300 --> 49:16.257
You know what?

49:16.301 --> 49:18.042
I actually
kind of admire that.

49:19.260 --> 49:20.870
Wait, where are
you staying?

49:20.914 --> 49:22.481
Uh, the employee quarters.

49:23.656 --> 49:25.136
Oh, no.

49:25.179 --> 49:26.354
That will not do.

49:26.398 --> 49:28.443
Follow me, please.

49:31.055 --> 49:32.186
[Nate]:
Welcome to the guest wing,

49:32.230 --> 49:34.536
where you should have been
all along.

49:34.580 --> 49:36.016
Amazing.

49:36.060 --> 49:38.149
Now, Avery, you're in here,

49:38.192 --> 49:40.716
and Susanna,
you're just next door.

49:43.502 --> 49:46.287
Told you
Nate would take care of us.

49:46.331 --> 49:47.985
Bit of an
improvement, hmm?

49:48.028 --> 49:49.595
Little bit, Nate.

49:49.638 --> 49:51.553
We can still call you Nate,
right?

49:51.597 --> 49:52.424
Of course.

49:52.467 --> 49:53.338
Well, in private,

49:53.381 --> 49:55.775
but in public,
we should...

49:55.818 --> 49:56.950
stick to the rules.

49:56.994 --> 49:57.995
[cell phone buzzing]

50:00.040 --> 50:01.389
Duty calls.
Um...

50:01.433 --> 50:03.565
can you join me
for lunch tomorrow?

50:03.609 --> 50:05.176
Uh, yeah, I'd love to.

50:05.219 --> 50:07.917
I just, I don't really know
if we get a lunch break or when.

50:07.961 --> 50:10.224
I certainly hope you do.

50:10.268 --> 50:11.530
Let's lunch together...

50:11.573 --> 50:13.227
although...

50:13.271 --> 50:15.403
to avoid
any more impromptu photo ops,

50:15.447 --> 50:18.015
shall we say the pagoda, noon?

50:18.058 --> 50:19.581
Okay, perfect.
Yeah, I'd love to.

50:19.625 --> 50:20.669
Great.

50:24.108 --> 50:25.283
[squealing]

50:37.034 --> 50:38.644
Good morning, Nathaniel.

50:38.687 --> 50:40.298
Good morning,
Mother.

50:43.779 --> 50:45.868
Don't you seem chipper
this morning?

50:45.912 --> 50:47.131
I am.

50:47.174 --> 50:49.350
I ran into a couple
of friends yesterday.

50:49.394 --> 50:51.135
Oh?

50:51.178 --> 50:52.919
Susanna and Avery Truitt.

50:52.962 --> 50:54.616
Ah.

50:56.836 --> 50:59.230
It seems you've
already met Susanna.

51:00.318 --> 51:03.060
Yes, when I was examining
the progress in the garden.

51:04.148 --> 51:05.236
What are you up to?

51:05.279 --> 51:07.064
I don't know what you mean.

51:07.107 --> 51:08.717
You know exactly what I mean.

51:08.761 --> 51:11.242
Well,
isn't she a friend of yours?

51:11.285 --> 51:12.982
Isn't this an opportunity
for her?

51:13.026 --> 51:14.375
Think of the stories

51:14.419 --> 51:15.724
she'll be able
to tell her clients

51:15.768 --> 51:17.248
when she gets back
to America.

51:17.291 --> 51:19.337
It'll be a feather
in her cap.

51:19.380 --> 51:21.252
It sounds so... benevolent.

51:21.295 --> 51:22.296
Thank you very much.

51:22.340 --> 51:25.212
If it was anything
but benevolent,

51:25.256 --> 51:27.345
would I have allowed her sister
to come along?

51:27.388 --> 51:28.694
Mm.

51:28.737 --> 51:30.217
I'm not sure,

51:30.261 --> 51:33.307
but you did place them both
in the employee quarters.

51:33.351 --> 51:35.831
Susanna is an employee.

51:35.875 --> 51:37.572
I'm sure that's the reason.

51:37.616 --> 51:38.791
Regardless,

51:38.834 --> 51:40.923
I've now moved them both
to the guest wing.

51:42.142 --> 51:43.317
Without consulting me?

51:43.361 --> 51:44.797
I don't need to consult you,
Mother...

51:44.840 --> 51:48.279
and...
be prepared.

51:48.322 --> 51:49.976
I'm inviting them both
to the coronation.

51:50.019 --> 51:52.021
The family coronation?

51:52.065 --> 51:52.892
Yes.

51:52.935 --> 51:53.762
You can't.

51:53.806 --> 51:54.937
Why not?

51:54.981 --> 51:56.548
She's American.

51:56.591 --> 51:57.766
They both are.

51:58.767 --> 52:00.160
And so is Mrs. Waller.

52:00.204 --> 52:03.120
I have invited a few
very select friends and family

52:03.163 --> 52:04.121
to your coronation.

52:04.164 --> 52:05.034
Exactly.

52:06.253 --> 52:07.254
My coronation.

52:08.734 --> 52:09.691
Nathaniel...

52:09.735 --> 52:11.345
I worry
that you'll get swept up,

52:11.389 --> 52:13.347
and do something foolish...

52:13.391 --> 52:14.957
like leave.

52:15.001 --> 52:17.743
I love my country, Mother.

52:17.786 --> 52:19.614
This is my home.

52:19.658 --> 52:20.789
I'm not going anywhere.

52:20.833 --> 52:23.966
Promise me
you will not abdicate.

52:24.010 --> 52:25.403
I would never.

52:25.446 --> 52:27.231
Good...

52:27.274 --> 52:28.275
because your cousin Colin
is next in line,

52:28.319 --> 52:29.276
and we both know

52:29.320 --> 52:30.886
he'd have
the throne room

52:30.930 --> 52:32.453
turned into a disco
by week's end.

52:32.497 --> 52:33.889
[chuckling]

52:33.933 --> 52:35.021
[chuckling]

52:38.764 --> 52:39.895
[Nate laughing]

52:39.939 --> 52:41.462
-It's true!
-No, you're exaggerating.

52:41.506 --> 52:42.855
Yeah, it's true.

52:42.898 --> 52:43.856
Oh, God.
Ah...

52:43.899 --> 52:45.031
[phone buzzing]

52:45.074 --> 52:46.075
Oh, sorry.

52:51.690 --> 52:53.170
Does the famous Lady Ginny know

52:53.213 --> 52:54.345
that you're having lunch
with me?

52:54.388 --> 52:56.085
No, why should she?

52:56.129 --> 52:57.304
I read somewhere

52:57.348 --> 52:58.436
that you guys
were practically engaged.

52:58.479 --> 53:00.264
Mm...
read where?

53:00.307 --> 53:02.353
It was online gossip websites.

53:02.396 --> 53:03.919
Ah, yes.

53:03.963 --> 53:05.312
They love
to speculate about us.

53:06.661 --> 53:08.185
So, is it true?

53:09.316 --> 53:11.492
Ginny and I have been friends
since we were children.

53:11.536 --> 53:13.015
And you dated?

53:13.059 --> 53:14.669
Briefly,
in university.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.629
Why'd you guys break up?

53:17.672 --> 53:20.806
Because neither of us
was ready to settle down.

53:22.242 --> 53:23.635
But someday, you might be?

53:23.678 --> 53:25.202
Ready to settle down?

53:25.245 --> 53:26.290
I certainly hope so.

53:29.815 --> 53:32.426
No, I mean, Lady Ginny
checks all the boxes.

53:32.470 --> 53:33.862
Mm.

53:33.906 --> 53:35.864
Now I know you've been reading
those gossip sites.

53:35.908 --> 53:37.692
What?
She's a Cambrian aristocrat.

53:37.736 --> 53:39.172
Isn't that essentially
a prerequisite?

53:39.216 --> 53:40.913
More of a tradition.

53:40.956 --> 53:42.480
Isn't it the same thing?

53:42.523 --> 53:44.264
To my mother, yes.

53:46.962 --> 53:48.660
Oh, I am going to be late
for work.

53:48.703 --> 53:49.922
I'll help you clean up.

53:49.965 --> 53:50.923
No, don't bother.

53:50.966 --> 53:51.967
I've got this.

53:52.011 --> 53:53.230
I've kept you too long
anyway.

53:53.273 --> 53:54.100
I don't want you to be late
for Sir Edward.

53:55.014 --> 53:55.971
Okay.

53:56.015 --> 53:57.016
I'll see you later.

53:57.059 --> 53:58.539
Bye.

53:58.583 --> 53:59.845
[Queen]:
It isn't working.

53:59.888 --> 54:01.107
What isn't?

54:01.150 --> 54:03.370
Bringing
the American here.

54:03.414 --> 54:04.415
First, I hear

54:04.458 --> 54:06.243
that Nathaniel has moved
the Truitts

54:06.286 --> 54:07.244
into the guest suites,

54:07.287 --> 54:08.245
and now I hear

54:08.288 --> 54:09.246
they're sneaking off
together

54:09.289 --> 54:10.725
to have lunches
in the garden.

54:10.769 --> 54:11.726
Lunches?

54:11.770 --> 54:12.727
Sounds harmless.

54:12.771 --> 54:14.860
It isn't harmless,
it's dangerous.

54:14.903 --> 54:17.079
Your plan has failed.

54:17.123 --> 54:19.343
Perhaps it's
because Nathaniel

54:19.386 --> 54:20.866
has already seen
Susanna

54:20.909 --> 54:22.215
in a garden
environment,

54:22.259 --> 54:24.696
and it's one
in which she excels.

54:24.739 --> 54:26.132
Even Sir Edward said
he was impressed

54:26.175 --> 54:27.046
with how hard she works.

54:27.089 --> 54:29.178
He said that?

54:29.222 --> 54:31.006
Sir Edward is rarely impressed,

54:31.050 --> 54:33.270
which doesn't help
the problem.

54:33.313 --> 54:34.532
Ah, wonderful.

54:34.575 --> 54:35.576
You're both here.

54:35.620 --> 54:36.795
I just wanted to let you know

54:36.838 --> 54:38.797
that I've invited
both Susanna and Avery

54:38.840 --> 54:40.277
to the Coronation Ball.

54:40.320 --> 54:41.408
John, please make note of that

54:41.452 --> 54:44.237
so there are no curious
security issues.

54:44.281 --> 54:45.847
Thanks.

54:45.891 --> 54:47.893
It's getting exciting.

54:59.165 --> 55:01.646
Nate, I can't
go to a ball.

55:01.689 --> 55:02.951
Why not?

55:02.995 --> 55:04.257
Because I'd feel
out of place.

55:04.301 --> 55:06.390
I've never been
to a royal ball before.

55:06.433 --> 55:09.218
It's probably going
to be deadly dull.

55:09.262 --> 55:11.046
You're not selling it.

55:11.090 --> 55:13.353
Unless you were there.

55:13.397 --> 55:15.834
Nate...

55:15.877 --> 55:18.053
Do you know
how to dance?

55:18.097 --> 55:20.447
Uh, does line
dancing count?

55:20.491 --> 55:21.492
I don't know
what that is,

55:21.535 --> 55:22.928
but I'm suddenly
desperate to see it.

55:22.971 --> 55:24.059
No.

55:24.103 --> 55:25.670
Fine.

55:25.713 --> 55:26.671
Hmm.

55:26.714 --> 55:27.715
What's in here?

55:32.067 --> 55:34.026
Wow.

55:34.069 --> 55:35.984
This is amazing.

55:39.597 --> 55:40.859
Wow.

55:40.902 --> 55:43.209
Not showing you
my line dancing here.

55:43.252 --> 55:44.602
A waltz.
It's easy.

55:44.645 --> 55:45.994
-No.
-Yes.

55:46.038 --> 55:47.518
-We can't.
-We are.

55:48.693 --> 55:49.520
Here?

55:49.563 --> 55:51.086
What could be better?

55:51.130 --> 55:52.087
It's easy.

55:52.131 --> 55:53.132
You'll pick it
right up.

55:53.175 --> 55:54.394
[playing music]

55:54.438 --> 55:56.135
So... follow
these steps.

55:56.178 --> 55:57.049
Madam.

55:58.224 --> 55:59.181
Right foot back.

56:00.487 --> 56:02.837
Left off to the side.

56:02.881 --> 56:03.838
Very good.

56:03.882 --> 56:04.839
I'm already confused.

56:04.883 --> 56:06.580
You got this.

56:06.624 --> 56:08.321
Now, left food forward.

56:08.365 --> 56:09.888
Right to the side,

56:09.931 --> 56:10.976
and left to right.

56:11.019 --> 56:13.195
Very good.
Again.

56:13.239 --> 56:16.460
One... two... three.

56:16.503 --> 56:19.811
One... two...
three.

56:21.421 --> 56:23.162
Did they teach you this
in prince school?

56:23.205 --> 56:25.730
They do.
It's on the test.

56:25.773 --> 56:27.427
[laughing]

56:27.471 --> 56:29.342
All right,
very good.

56:29.386 --> 56:30.691
Now we partner.

56:30.735 --> 56:32.258
Okay.

56:38.438 --> 56:40.658
Same as before.

56:40.701 --> 56:41.702
I'll lead.

56:44.139 --> 56:45.489
And...

56:45.532 --> 56:47.926
one, two, three...

56:47.969 --> 56:50.058
one, two, three...

56:50.102 --> 56:51.799
Yes...

57:17.956 --> 57:19.348
[chuckling]

57:19.392 --> 57:21.089
You're great.

57:38.977 --> 57:39.934
Hey.

57:39.978 --> 57:40.935
Sorry I'm late.

57:40.979 --> 57:41.936
Oh, don't be silly.

57:41.980 --> 57:44.504
I only just got here myself.

57:44.548 --> 57:45.592
Did you start without me?

57:45.636 --> 57:47.725
Uh, well, no.

57:47.768 --> 57:49.161
I might have had
just one sandwich.

57:49.204 --> 57:50.467
Okay.

57:52.817 --> 57:54.427
What's that?

57:54.471 --> 57:55.733
Ah, my oath.

57:55.776 --> 57:56.864
What's that for?

57:57.865 --> 57:59.345
My coronation oath.

57:59.388 --> 58:01.608
See, the Archbishop
reads this here and here,

58:01.652 --> 58:04.002
and I respond.

58:04.045 --> 58:05.220
Kind of like wedding vows.

58:05.264 --> 58:07.266
A bit, yes.

58:07.309 --> 58:09.007
Have you practiced?

58:09.050 --> 58:10.095
Only just,

58:10.138 --> 58:11.096
but I'm supposed to.

58:12.271 --> 58:13.228
Let's practice.

58:13.272 --> 58:14.969
All right.

58:17.711 --> 58:19.626
[clearing throat]

58:19.670 --> 58:20.845
Ready?

58:20.888 --> 58:22.455
Yes.

58:22.499 --> 58:25.763
"Are you, Nathaniel Kenneth
Richard Leopold Bartholomew..."

58:25.806 --> 58:26.764
Seriously?

58:26.807 --> 58:28.853
Yes.
My father's was longer.

58:28.896 --> 58:30.594
Wow.

58:30.637 --> 58:31.899
"Are you willing and able

58:31.943 --> 58:33.945
to take the oath
to be the King of Cambria?"

58:33.988 --> 58:36.513
I am willing and able
to take this oath

58:36.556 --> 58:37.949
and swear by all that I have

58:37.992 --> 58:41.039
that I will be a good
and faithful servant.

58:41.082 --> 58:42.997
"And do you promise
to uphold and defend

58:43.041 --> 58:44.738
the laws, charters,
and constitution

58:44.782 --> 58:46.087
of the Kingdom of Cambria?"

58:46.131 --> 58:48.046
I do so promise.

58:48.089 --> 58:49.090
"And do you promise

58:49.134 --> 58:50.048
to protect
the freedoms and rights

58:50.091 --> 58:51.397
of all Cambrian citizens?"

58:51.440 --> 58:52.833
I do...

58:52.877 --> 58:53.921
with all my heart,

58:53.965 --> 58:55.314
from this day forward

58:55.357 --> 58:56.924
and all the days of my life...

58:56.968 --> 58:58.099
so help me God.

58:58.143 --> 59:00.885
"I now pronounce you
King and country."

59:00.928 --> 59:02.713
[clapping]

59:02.756 --> 59:04.105
Nicely done, Nathaniel.

59:04.149 --> 59:05.890
I think you and Cambria
will make a lovely couple.

59:05.933 --> 59:08.327
Ginny!
What brings you here?

59:08.370 --> 59:09.633
The Queen sent me.

59:09.676 --> 59:10.895
Now, don't be rude.

59:10.938 --> 59:12.331
Introduce me
to your friend.

59:12.374 --> 59:13.462
Of course.

59:13.506 --> 59:15.334
Ginny, this is Susanna Truitt.

59:15.377 --> 59:17.118
Susanna, this is
Lady Genevieve Byron.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.122
Do I curtsy?

59:21.166 --> 59:22.297
Please don't.

59:22.341 --> 59:23.124
I'm too young to feel
like my parents.

59:23.168 --> 59:24.430
[laughing]

59:24.473 --> 59:25.431
Why did my mother
send you?

59:25.474 --> 59:26.693
Apparently,

59:26.737 --> 59:28.042
Her Majesty was trying
to get ahold of you

59:28.086 --> 59:30.175
about some
coronation logistics...

59:30.218 --> 59:31.872
something or another,

59:31.916 --> 59:33.439
and to talk
to the Archbishop,

59:33.482 --> 59:36.311
but you don't seem to be
answering your phone.

59:36.355 --> 59:37.922
Um...

59:38.836 --> 59:39.793
Well, I'll just...

59:39.837 --> 59:41.621
I'll clean up.

59:41.665 --> 59:42.840
I'll help.

59:42.883 --> 59:44.058
Okay.

59:44.102 --> 59:45.538
Thank you both.

59:45.582 --> 59:46.539
Your oath?

59:46.583 --> 59:47.366
Right.

59:47.409 --> 59:49.063
Can't forget that.

59:53.502 --> 59:55.722
It's lovely to meet
you at last, Susanna.

59:55.766 --> 59:57.550
At last?

59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.074
Well, you've certainly been
the talk of the town

01:00:00.118 --> 01:00:01.946
since the photos surfaced.

01:00:05.514 --> 01:00:06.603
I don't think
you know

01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:07.865
what you'd be getting
yourself into.

01:00:09.214 --> 01:00:10.215
I'm sorry?

01:00:11.346 --> 01:00:12.304
With Nathaniel.

01:00:12.347 --> 01:00:13.522
Oh, we're just friends.

01:00:13.566 --> 01:00:15.002
Yes,

01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:17.396
but as one who has
genuinely been his friend

01:00:17.439 --> 01:00:18.440
for many years,

01:00:18.484 --> 01:00:19.964
I think it should
be pointed out

01:00:20.007 --> 01:00:21.661
that standing
beside royalty

01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:23.663
is much more than
watching polo matches

01:00:23.707 --> 01:00:24.708
and wearing
the proper hat.

01:00:24.751 --> 01:00:27.145
There are expectations.

01:00:28.755 --> 01:00:30.409
Why are you
telling me this?

01:00:30.452 --> 01:00:33.717
Because I care deeply
about the Cambrian monarchy,

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.849
and if it is to survive
the 21st century,

01:00:35.893 --> 01:00:38.025
then Nathaniel needs
someone beside him

01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:40.201
who understands how to control
what people see...

01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:43.422
and what they do not.

01:00:43.465 --> 01:00:45.076
You.

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:47.992
It's nothing personal, Susanna.

01:00:48.035 --> 01:00:49.602
This is merely the way
things are.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.430
Tradition.

01:00:51.473 --> 01:00:52.605
That's right.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.476
Tradition.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.435
I'll take this
back to the house.

01:00:56.478 --> 01:00:58.176
Bring the glasses,
will you?

01:01:11.755 --> 01:01:13.321
Look who I found!

01:01:13.365 --> 01:01:14.409
Mrs. Waller!

01:01:14.453 --> 01:01:16.107
I came for the coronation

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:17.891
and much to my delight

01:01:17.935 --> 01:01:21.068
found I wasn't the only
St. Simons resident here.

01:01:21.112 --> 01:01:22.330
I've been
catching her up

01:01:22.374 --> 01:01:23.636
on everything
you've been doing.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.594
And not doing.

01:01:25.638 --> 01:01:26.987
Your sister tells me

01:01:27.031 --> 01:01:29.163
you haven't gotten your gowns
for the ball yet.

01:01:29.207 --> 01:01:31.165
Well, we're not sure
if we're going.

01:01:31.209 --> 01:01:32.297
We're going.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.385
[Mrs. Waller]:
You've been invited,

01:01:33.428 --> 01:01:35.256
haven't you?

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.301
Yeah.

01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:37.737
By the prince
himself.

01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:38.738
Well then...

01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:40.653
as ladies of
St. Simons, Georgia,

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:43.874
it's our duty to make sure
we properly represent.

01:01:43.917 --> 01:01:45.745
We are going
shopping.

01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:47.094
My treat.

01:01:54.754 --> 01:01:55.537
What do you think?

01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:56.582
Yes, let's go!

01:01:59.454 --> 01:02:01.282
It's so
beautiful here.

01:02:01.326 --> 01:02:04.111
The first time I came
to Cambria as a little girl,

01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:05.330
I thought
this is the place

01:02:05.373 --> 01:02:07.114
that all the fairy tales
were talking about.

01:02:07.158 --> 01:02:09.029
That's exactly
what it feels like.

01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:10.422
And you have the best view
of anyone,

01:02:10.465 --> 01:02:12.380
working in the gardens.

01:02:12.424 --> 01:02:13.686
You have seen
the Florentine Gardens?

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.557
I've been
working so much,

01:02:15.601 --> 01:02:17.646
I haven't really
had a chance.

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:19.910
You have to change that.

01:02:34.228 --> 01:02:35.664
What are you doing here?

01:02:37.144 --> 01:02:38.450
Mrs. Waller told me
about these gardens,

01:02:38.493 --> 01:02:39.538
so I was just...

01:02:39.581 --> 01:02:40.800
This is a private garden.

01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:42.584
I'm sorry,
I didn't know that.

01:02:42.628 --> 01:02:44.891
It's really beautiful.

01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:46.893
Yes, it is.

01:02:47.807 --> 01:02:48.765
It's Italian,
isn't it?

01:02:50.723 --> 01:02:52.203
That's right.

01:02:52.246 --> 01:02:54.205
The design is exquisite.

01:02:54.248 --> 01:02:55.206
Did Sir Edward do it?

01:02:56.468 --> 01:02:58.383
No, my...

01:02:58.426 --> 01:03:01.821
late husband, Leo...

01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:03.780
designed this garden for me.

01:03:03.823 --> 01:03:05.390
For you?

01:03:05.433 --> 01:03:06.870
Yes.

01:03:06.913 --> 01:03:08.523
It was
a wedding present.

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:11.831
He redesigned
the castle gardens

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:14.138
to match the garden
where he proposed to me,

01:03:14.181 --> 01:03:15.792
in Florence...

01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:16.836
a proposal

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.404
that I was free
to accept

01:03:19.447 --> 01:03:21.536
because
I was from a Cambrian family.

01:03:23.451 --> 01:03:25.018
The tradition
in Cambria.

01:03:25.062 --> 01:03:27.629
An important one...

01:03:27.673 --> 01:03:29.936
one that should be respected.

01:03:35.072 --> 01:03:36.073
Well, thank you

01:03:36.116 --> 01:03:37.030
for letting me
share in your garden.

01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:39.119
It's beautiful.

01:03:47.519 --> 01:03:49.173
[church bells ringing]

01:04:09.976 --> 01:04:11.848
I only wish your father
were here to see this.

01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:14.285
He would be
so proud.

01:04:14.328 --> 01:04:15.590
Thank you.

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:20.291
Good luck.

01:04:47.144 --> 01:04:48.449
Are you,

01:04:48.493 --> 01:04:51.975
Nathaniel Kenneth Richard
Leopold Bartholomew,

01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:54.325
willing and able
to take the oath

01:04:54.368 --> 01:04:56.675
to be the King of Cambria?

01:04:56.718 --> 01:04:57.937
I am willing and able,

01:04:57.981 --> 01:04:59.591
and swear by all that I have

01:04:59.634 --> 01:05:02.681
that I will be
a good and faithful servant.

01:05:02.724 --> 01:05:04.335
And do you promise

01:05:04.378 --> 01:05:06.163
to protect
the freedoms and rights

01:05:06.206 --> 01:05:09.122
of all Cambrian citizens
and residents?

01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:11.559
I do,
with all my heart,

01:05:11.603 --> 01:05:14.562
from this day forward
and all the days of my life,

01:05:14.606 --> 01:05:17.870
so help me God.

01:05:33.886 --> 01:05:35.801
God save the King!

01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:38.108
God save the King.

01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:47.987
Could be
your turn next, Ginny.

01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:49.510
I'm not sure what
you mean, Your Majesty.

01:05:49.554 --> 01:05:51.991
The king needs a queen.

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:53.645
I can't think of anyone
more suited to the position

01:05:53.688 --> 01:05:56.561
than you.

01:06:16.798 --> 01:06:18.148
Why are you packing?

01:06:18.191 --> 01:06:19.932
I'm not going.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.890
What?

01:06:21.934 --> 01:06:23.718
But... we have dresses!

01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:26.025
I'll return mine
to Mrs. Waller.

01:06:28.332 --> 01:06:29.159
What is going on?

01:06:29.202 --> 01:06:31.291
I just...

01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:33.163
what am I thinking?

01:06:33.206 --> 01:06:36.514
This whole thing with Nate,
it's never going to... work.

01:06:38.342 --> 01:06:41.171
I'm going to let you in
on a little secret.

01:06:41.214 --> 01:06:42.737
You've never once looked
at anyone

01:06:42.781 --> 01:06:44.043
the way you look at Nate.

01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:47.003
Not even close.

01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:49.353
That makes it worse.

01:06:49.396 --> 01:06:50.615
Because...?

01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:52.225
Because he's not "Nate".

01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:53.835
He's not the guy
who helped me lug soil

01:06:53.879 --> 01:06:55.228
and helped me
in Mrs. Waller's garden

01:06:55.272 --> 01:06:57.404
and who I rode bikes
with around St. Simons.

01:06:57.448 --> 01:07:00.277
He's Nathaniel,
King of Cambria now.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.496
And you're my big sister

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.063
who worked
all through high school

01:07:04.107 --> 01:07:05.456
and still got straight As,

01:07:05.499 --> 01:07:07.675
then worked
two jobs in college

01:07:07.719 --> 01:07:10.156
and got on I don't even know
how many honor rolls

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.418
every single year.

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:14.465
Okay, you're strong

01:07:14.508 --> 01:07:16.380
and smart and caring,

01:07:16.423 --> 01:07:18.817
and if King Nathaniel
suddenly forgets all of that

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.906
just because he recited
some vows or whatever,

01:07:20.949 --> 01:07:24.083
then he's not
the Nate that we know.

01:07:28.305 --> 01:07:29.480
How many times in your life
do you think

01:07:29.523 --> 01:07:31.525
we'll get an invitation
to a royal ball?

01:07:31.569 --> 01:07:34.615
Come on, Susie!

01:07:34.659 --> 01:07:35.616
We have to go.

01:07:38.924 --> 01:07:40.795
[♪♪♪]

01:07:56.768 --> 01:07:57.769
If you're looking
for Lady Ginny,

01:07:57.812 --> 01:07:59.771
she's right over there.

01:08:07.909 --> 01:08:09.998
The renovations to the gardens
are being well received.

01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:11.870
Mm.

01:08:11.913 --> 01:08:14.568
Do you think your father
would have approved?

01:08:14.612 --> 01:08:16.309
He would love them.

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:19.877
In fact...

01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:21.923
they're so beautiful,

01:08:21.966 --> 01:08:23.273
I want to share them
with the public.

01:08:23.316 --> 01:08:24.883
Really?

01:08:24.926 --> 01:08:26.711
Really.

01:08:26.754 --> 01:08:29.148
We've kept them to
ourselves for too long.

01:08:29.192 --> 01:08:31.194
It's time we open them up.

01:08:31.237 --> 01:08:32.890
It's time we open up.

01:08:32.934 --> 01:08:34.979
Oh, I see.

01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:36.764
Man of the People.

01:08:36.808 --> 01:08:38.201
Yes.

01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:39.462
Change will do us good.

01:08:39.506 --> 01:08:41.725
You're the king.

01:08:41.769 --> 01:08:44.859
Apparently.

01:09:08.231 --> 01:09:09.667
You know...

01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:11.408
I believe this is the first time
we've danced together

01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:13.323
since we dated.

01:09:13.366 --> 01:09:15.281
A long time ago.

01:09:15.325 --> 01:09:17.631
Some things remain the same.

01:09:17.675 --> 01:09:20.460
Everyone is staring.

01:09:20.504 --> 01:09:21.895
Everyone
always stares.

01:09:21.939 --> 01:09:23.158
You're not.

01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:24.203
Your eyes are
everywhere else

01:09:24.247 --> 01:09:26.553
but on me.

01:09:26.596 --> 01:09:28.511
I'm sure she'll show up soon.

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:31.515
Who?

01:09:31.558 --> 01:09:33.473
You know who.

01:09:36.563 --> 01:09:37.564
[music ending]

01:09:37.608 --> 01:09:39.131
[clapping]

01:10:05.723 --> 01:10:06.724
Susanna.

01:10:08.378 --> 01:10:10.989
I heard some music.

01:10:11.032 --> 01:10:13.209
Thought I would check it out,
see what was going on.

01:10:14.079 --> 01:10:15.776
Just this little party
I'm throwing.

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:18.039
Any special occasion?

01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:20.607
None that I can think of
at this very moment.

01:10:22.522 --> 01:10:24.829
Will you dance with me?

01:10:42.368 --> 01:10:44.022
Look into my eyes.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.242
Remember our practice.

01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:48.592
Just pretend
it's you and I in here.

01:10:48.635 --> 01:10:49.636
All right?

01:10:52.509 --> 01:10:53.814
[waltz playing]

01:11:24.976 --> 01:11:26.325
Good evening,
Mrs. Waller.

01:11:26.369 --> 01:11:27.935
John.

01:11:27.979 --> 01:11:29.241
I've been meaning
to thank you

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:31.722
for your recommendations
on dress shops in town.

01:11:31.765 --> 01:11:33.332
They were
quite fruitful,

01:11:33.376 --> 01:11:34.768
as you can see.

01:11:36.117 --> 01:11:37.075
Just doing my job.

01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:39.512
Which is?

01:11:39.556 --> 01:11:41.471
To protect Nathaniel.

01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:08.062
You look
beautiful.

01:12:08.106 --> 01:12:09.325
Oh...

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:11.196
Mrs. Waller helped me
pick out this dress.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.591
It's not the dress.

01:12:14.634 --> 01:12:15.635
It's you.

01:12:16.593 --> 01:12:17.942
But I must admit,

01:12:17.985 --> 01:12:20.074
I was a bit nervous there
that you weren't coming.

01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:21.902
Well, I almost didn't.

01:12:21.946 --> 01:12:23.426
Why?

01:12:23.469 --> 01:12:25.732
Because you're a king, Nate.

01:12:25.776 --> 01:12:26.690
Nathaniel.

01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:27.821
Nate.

01:12:27.865 --> 01:12:29.997
To you, I will always be Nate.

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:31.608
But to the rest of the world,

01:12:31.651 --> 01:12:34.524
you're King Nathaniel
Kenneth Richard...

01:12:34.567 --> 01:12:35.916
...Leopold Bartholomew.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:36.830
It's exhausting.

01:12:36.874 --> 01:12:38.745
It's always been
exhausting...

01:12:39.833 --> 01:12:40.791
but with you
by my side,

01:12:40.834 --> 01:12:42.096
I finally feel

01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.055
like I can tackle this
new chapter of my life

01:12:44.098 --> 01:12:45.709
and remain sane...

01:12:45.752 --> 01:12:46.927
thrive, even.

01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:50.975
You don't need me to thrive.

01:12:51.018 --> 01:12:52.193
You were born
to be king.

01:12:52.237 --> 01:12:53.673
You're going to be amazing
at this.

01:12:55.806 --> 01:12:56.720
Oh, wow.

01:12:56.763 --> 01:12:58.286
What?

01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:00.593
It just hit me.

01:13:00.637 --> 01:13:01.812
It just truly
hit me...

01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:04.684
I'm a king.

01:13:06.469 --> 01:13:08.471
We should have a toast
to celebrate,

01:13:08.514 --> 01:13:09.646
like you did for me

01:13:09.689 --> 01:13:10.821
when I was hired
for Mrs. Waller's gardens.

01:13:10.864 --> 01:13:11.865
Excellent idea...

01:13:13.606 --> 01:13:14.781
although I'm not sure
we have any sweet tea here

01:13:14.825 --> 01:13:15.782
in Cambria.

01:13:15.826 --> 01:13:17.654
Some champagne, then?

01:13:17.697 --> 01:13:19.220
It's a sacrifice,

01:13:19.264 --> 01:13:21.179
but...

01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:24.269
You really are
beautiful.

01:13:26.532 --> 01:13:28.273
I'll be right back.

01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:39.023
Two glasses of champagne?

01:13:39.066 --> 01:13:41.460
Is one of
those for me?

01:13:42.853 --> 01:13:43.636
Um...

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.942
No, I understand.

01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:47.423
I didn't until I saw
the two of you together,

01:13:47.466 --> 01:13:48.772
dancing and laughing,

01:13:48.815 --> 01:13:49.990
and you looking at her

01:13:50.034 --> 01:13:51.252
how I'd always hoped
you'd look at me...

01:13:53.603 --> 01:13:54.995
but you never did,

01:13:55.039 --> 01:13:56.997
and you never will.

01:13:57.041 --> 01:13:58.434
Ginny...

01:14:00.392 --> 01:14:02.438
would you be cross with me
if I said

01:14:02.481 --> 01:14:03.874
I think
you two might get along?

01:14:03.917 --> 01:14:06.703
Yes, right now, I will...

01:14:06.746 --> 01:14:08.095
but...

01:14:08.139 --> 01:14:09.488
I think you're right.

01:14:09.532 --> 01:14:10.489
Someday.

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:12.360
Someday.

01:14:24.329 --> 01:14:25.852
Ah, Susanna,
there you are.

01:14:25.896 --> 01:14:28.855
I was looking
for you.

01:14:28.899 --> 01:14:31.684
I have a little
confession.

01:14:31.728 --> 01:14:32.772
I was the one

01:14:32.816 --> 01:14:34.774
who arranged
your apprenticeship.

01:14:35.775 --> 01:14:37.385
Why?

01:14:37.429 --> 01:14:38.909
I wanted
to show my son

01:14:38.952 --> 01:14:40.737
how wrong you are,
both for him,

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.781
and for Cambria.

01:14:41.825 --> 01:14:43.566
Well, respectfully,
Your Majesty,

01:14:43.609 --> 01:14:45.872
I've never claimed
to be right for him.

01:14:45.916 --> 01:14:47.483
Love is wonderful,

01:14:47.526 --> 01:14:48.788
but it fades,

01:14:48.832 --> 01:14:51.443
and in its place remains
responsibility and duty,

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:54.054
neither of which is easy,

01:14:54.098 --> 01:14:56.666
and that is why our family
has always married

01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:58.450
people from Cambria.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:14:59.495
They know
what to expect,

01:14:59.538 --> 01:15:01.975
both the good
and the bad.

01:15:02.019 --> 01:15:03.716
Like Lady Ginny.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.675
Nathaniel may not be
in love with her,

01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:09.113
but he respects her
and likes her

01:15:09.156 --> 01:15:10.506
and knows that
she is ready

01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:11.507
to take over the position

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:14.118
and the commitments.

01:15:14.161 --> 01:15:15.249
And I'm not?

01:15:15.293 --> 01:15:17.338
How could you be?

01:15:17.382 --> 01:15:18.688
You're not from here.

01:15:20.124 --> 01:15:22.779
I like you,
Susanna...

01:15:22.822 --> 01:15:26.565
but I simply must put
my country,

01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:29.133
and my son's
future, first...

01:15:29.176 --> 01:15:30.221
no matter what.

01:15:33.224 --> 01:15:35.661
Good night, Susanna.

01:16:14.091 --> 01:16:15.745
[eager chatting]

01:16:15.788 --> 01:16:16.789
[Evie]:
Oh, thank you!

01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:18.182
Look forward
to seeing you next week.

01:16:18.225 --> 01:16:19.531
You too.
Thank you so much.

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:20.706
Have a good day.

01:16:22.752 --> 01:16:24.275
Evie Jones seems happy.

01:16:24.318 --> 01:16:25.537
I know.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:26.756
I'm going to start
on her place next week.

01:16:26.799 --> 01:16:28.671
Oh, honey,
I'm so proud!

01:16:28.714 --> 01:16:29.759
And I have
two other leads

01:16:29.802 --> 01:16:30.934
that came in.

01:16:30.977 --> 01:16:32.588
Oh, that's wonderful!

01:16:32.631 --> 01:16:33.980
I guess word spread
really fast

01:16:34.024 --> 01:16:36.504
about me working
on Mrs. Waller's house.

01:16:36.548 --> 01:16:38.768
Maybe
you should tell Nate.

01:16:38.811 --> 01:16:41.858
Have you spoken to him?

01:16:41.901 --> 01:16:44.600
No, and I don't expect to,

01:16:44.643 --> 01:16:46.036
but it's okay.

01:16:46.079 --> 01:16:47.733
I think even though things
may have not worked out

01:16:47.777 --> 01:16:48.908
the way that
I'd hoped,

01:16:48.952 --> 01:16:50.562
I believe things are going
to work out

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:52.651
the way
that they're supposed to.

01:17:03.575 --> 01:17:05.621
His Majesty's lunch
with the Prime Minister

01:17:05.664 --> 01:17:07.144
went very well.

01:17:07.187 --> 01:17:08.536
I feel confident

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.669
they'll have an excellent
working relationship.

01:17:10.713 --> 01:17:11.670
Excellent.

01:17:11.714 --> 01:17:12.889
Thank you, John.

01:17:12.932 --> 01:17:15.587
If there are
no further questions...

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:17.328
It's been a week
since the coronation.

01:17:17.371 --> 01:17:20.113
Do you think
he's begun to get over her?

01:17:21.158 --> 01:17:22.115
No.

01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:24.204
Nor do I.

01:17:24.248 --> 01:17:25.597
In fact, if anything,

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.207
I think it's rather worse
than before she arrived.

01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:31.342
John...

01:17:31.385 --> 01:17:32.473
one of the many qualities

01:17:32.517 --> 01:17:34.693
that I have always
admired about you

01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:36.826
is your uncanny ability

01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:40.177
to accurately assess
a person or a situation

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:44.311
and to give sound,
sage advice.

01:17:44.355 --> 01:17:46.009
Thank you, ma'am.

01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:49.099
So, I find it
rather confusing

01:17:49.142 --> 01:17:50.753
that when it came
to making suggestions

01:17:50.796 --> 01:17:51.971
as to what to do

01:17:52.015 --> 01:17:54.931
about Nathaniel's feelings
for Susanna,

01:17:54.974 --> 01:17:55.975
you came up
with a plan

01:17:56.019 --> 01:17:58.282
that was so
spectacularly wrong.

01:17:58.325 --> 01:17:59.849
Did I?

01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:02.199
Didn't you?

01:18:02.242 --> 01:18:03.722
Ma'am,

01:18:03.766 --> 01:18:05.898
my job always has been
and always will be

01:18:05.942 --> 01:18:07.378
to protect this family.

01:18:07.421 --> 01:18:10.381
Protection comes
in many forms.

01:18:10.424 --> 01:18:12.209
I feel very confident
that my suggestion

01:18:12.252 --> 01:18:14.515
to bring Ms. Truitt
to Cambria

01:18:14.559 --> 01:18:16.430
was entirely about
doing what is best

01:18:16.474 --> 01:18:18.781
for this family,

01:18:18.824 --> 01:18:21.566
and the King.

01:18:21.609 --> 01:18:22.610
Ma'am.

01:18:31.968 --> 01:18:34.013
What are you doing?

01:18:34.057 --> 01:18:35.319
Gardening.

01:18:36.276 --> 01:18:38.278
I remember when Father
and I used to come here

01:18:38.322 --> 01:18:40.367
when I was a boy...

01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:42.718
get our hands dirty.

01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:45.851
It's important, you know?

01:18:45.895 --> 01:18:48.724
Stay connected
to the earth...

01:18:48.767 --> 01:18:52.292
not feel above
anyone or anything.

01:18:52.336 --> 01:18:53.729
I remember

01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:55.774
when the two of you used
to come back from the garden

01:18:55.818 --> 01:18:58.516
covered in dirt
and happy as could be.

01:18:58.559 --> 01:19:01.954
I think
Father would have liked her.

01:19:03.956 --> 01:19:07.046
They could've talked about
the garden together.

01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:08.265
Probably.

01:19:10.833 --> 01:19:12.791
I just don't understand
why she left.

01:19:12.835 --> 01:19:15.489
You know,
why didn't she say goodbye?

01:19:15.533 --> 01:19:16.621
Perhaps she thought

01:19:16.664 --> 01:19:17.883
she was doing the right thing
for you.

01:19:17.927 --> 01:19:20.190
The right thing?

01:19:20.233 --> 01:19:22.975
She seems
like a sensible girl.

01:19:23.019 --> 01:19:25.282
I'm sure her heart
is in the right place.

01:19:26.457 --> 01:19:27.719
And what place is that?

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:30.417
A realistic place.

01:19:30.461 --> 01:19:31.505
She understands

01:19:31.549 --> 01:19:33.290
that marriage to you
is impossible.

01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:34.378
Because of tradition.

01:19:34.421 --> 01:19:35.683
Yes.

01:19:35.727 --> 01:19:37.729
So, because no member
of the royal family

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.339
has ever married
someone not born in Cambria,

01:19:39.383 --> 01:19:40.427
I'm not free to do so now?

01:19:40.471 --> 01:19:41.951
-Nathaniel, listen...
-No, Mother.

01:19:41.994 --> 01:19:42.995
When I took the oath
to be king,

01:19:43.039 --> 01:19:44.388
I swore that I would protect

01:19:44.431 --> 01:19:45.781
the rights and freedoms
of all Cambrian citizens.

01:19:45.824 --> 01:19:47.347
Of course.

01:19:47.391 --> 01:19:49.915
I am a Cambrian citizen.

01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:51.830
I have rights,
and I have freedoms.

01:19:51.874 --> 01:19:54.920
But...
you are an example.

01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:56.139
And what sort of example
would I be

01:19:56.182 --> 01:19:58.576
were I to abandon
the woman that I love?

01:20:04.408 --> 01:20:08.194
I've never heard
you say those words before...

01:20:08.238 --> 01:20:09.892
that you love someone.

01:20:11.589 --> 01:20:14.722
Because I've never
said them before.

01:20:14.766 --> 01:20:17.595
Words have impact and meaning,

01:20:17.638 --> 01:20:20.337
and I do not use them lightly.

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.948
Just like your father.

01:20:22.992 --> 01:20:25.690
Yes.

01:20:25.733 --> 01:20:27.126
He said to me

01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:28.824
he only ever told one woman ever
that he loved her...

01:20:30.347 --> 01:20:31.435
and that, when
my time came,

01:20:31.478 --> 01:20:33.350
I better mean it.

01:20:34.917 --> 01:20:37.180
I do, Mother.

01:20:51.411 --> 01:20:52.673
-[Avery]: Hey.
-Hey!

01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:54.066
What are you doing
for the rest of the night?

01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:55.372
I'm just going to go home

01:20:55.415 --> 01:20:57.330
and work on this design
for Evie Jones' garden.

01:20:57.374 --> 01:20:59.332
Can you give me a ride home?

01:20:59.376 --> 01:21:00.333
What happened to your car?

01:21:00.377 --> 01:21:02.335
I got another flat.

01:21:02.379 --> 01:21:03.510
-Avery!
-I know.

01:21:03.554 --> 01:21:05.034
I know.
Come on.

01:21:05.077 --> 01:21:06.035
Let's get out of here.

01:21:06.078 --> 01:21:07.079
I'll drive.

01:21:07.123 --> 01:21:08.994
Okay.

01:21:10.517 --> 01:21:12.302
[Susanna]:
Why are we stopping?

01:21:14.347 --> 01:21:15.435
What's this?

01:21:15.479 --> 01:21:17.089
Go on.

01:21:48.555 --> 01:21:50.035
Hello.

01:21:50.079 --> 01:21:52.429
Nate?

01:21:52.472 --> 01:21:54.300
What's all this?

01:21:56.737 --> 01:21:58.957
Susanna, I don't know
if you have any interest

01:21:59.001 --> 01:22:00.219
in becoming
part of the royal family.

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.440
It can be
a bit of a challenge,

01:22:03.483 --> 01:22:05.398
I assure you,

01:22:05.442 --> 01:22:07.618
but if you do...

01:22:07.661 --> 01:22:08.880
and if you love me
even a fraction as much

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:09.925
as I love you...

01:22:11.448 --> 01:22:14.190
then I know
we can rewrite tradition.

01:22:14.233 --> 01:22:16.148
Susanna...

01:22:19.978 --> 01:22:23.634
I offer to you my future,

01:22:23.677 --> 01:22:25.201
my heart, and my kingdom.

01:22:27.594 --> 01:22:29.770
Will you marry me
and be my queen?

01:22:30.771 --> 01:22:32.251
Uh...

01:22:32.295 --> 01:22:35.211
Susanna,
give the boy an answer!

01:22:35.254 --> 01:22:38.257
Are you guys crashing
my engagement?

01:22:38.301 --> 01:22:40.129
Focus, Susanna.

01:22:40.172 --> 01:22:42.609
I thought you wanted...

01:22:42.653 --> 01:22:44.394
More than anything,

01:22:44.437 --> 01:22:46.309
I want what
any mother wants...

01:22:46.352 --> 01:22:48.354
for her child
to be happy,

01:22:48.398 --> 01:22:50.791
and you make him happy.

01:22:57.276 --> 01:22:59.191
Yes.

01:22:59.235 --> 01:23:01.889
Nathaniel Kenneth
Richard Leopold Bartholomew,

01:23:01.933 --> 01:23:04.588
I will absolutely
be your queen.

01:23:20.604 --> 01:23:22.301
And one more thing,
my Peach Princess.

01:23:22.345 --> 01:23:23.955
We need somebody
to renovate

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:24.956
the North Oval
of the gardens.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.959
Any suggestions?

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:29.265
One.
