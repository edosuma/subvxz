00:15.180 --> 00:17.148
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

00:17.180 --> 00:17.976
WHOA.

00:18.010 --> 00:18.578
IT'S BARELY MORNING,
JUST HOLD UP.

00:18.610 --> 00:20.111
I KNOW YOU'RE EXCITED.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.572
YOUR ADRENALINE IS RUSHING,

00:21.620 --> 00:22.814
YOUR HEART RATE IS PUMPING,

00:22.850 --> 00:24.681
JUST LIKE YOU GOT A BIG CASE
AND THIS IS A HOT CRIME SCENE.

00:24.720 --> 00:25.618
DAD...

00:25.650 --> 00:27.709
I JUST WANT TO SEE
WHAT SANTA BROUGHT ME.

00:27.760 --> 00:28.784
AND YOU WILL...

00:28.820 --> 00:30.583
SOON ENOUGH.
BUT FIRST,

00:30.630 --> 00:31.551
I WANT YOU TO RECREATE

00:31.590 --> 00:33.353
EVERYTHING THAT WENT
DOWN HERE LAST NIGHT.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.733
SANTA CAME IN...

00:45.740 --> 00:47.469
SAT DOWN,

00:47.510 --> 00:48.670
ATE HIS MILK AND COOKIES,

00:52.250 --> 00:54.775
PUT THE PRESENTS
UNDER THE TREE,

00:57.650 --> 01:00.153
THEN SOMETHING SPOOKED HIM
AND HE RAN OUT.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.214
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.626
MAYBE YOU WOKE UP A LITTLE
EARLIER THAN HE THOUGHT.

01:03.660 --> 01:04.558
IT'S A PITY, TOO,
BECAUSE

01:04.590 --> 01:06.854
HE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO FINISH PUTTING

01:06.900 --> 01:08.697
TOGETHER YOUR BRAND
NEW BICYCLE.

01:08.730 --> 01:10.095
WHOA.

01:16.170 --> 01:18.365
MERRY CHRISTMAS, SHAWN.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.300
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

01:23.350 --> 01:25.170
YOU KNOW I HAVE
TO GET TO MY MOM AND DAD'S.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.747
CHOOSING THE PERFECT
HOLIDAY GIFI' TAKES TIME, GUS.

01:27.780 --> 01:29.645
YOU CAN'T CUT CORNERS.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.817
YOU HAVE TO CUSTOMIZE.

01:31.850 --> 01:33.454
MATCH THE GIFT...

01:33.490 --> 01:35.117
WITH THE INDIVIDUAL.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.320
LOOK...

01:36.360 --> 01:38.726
I TOOK OUR
HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS

01:38.760 --> 01:40.421
AND PUT SANTA HATS
ON THEM.

01:40.460 --> 01:41.427
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:41.460 --> 01:43.690
[screwball noise]

01:43.730 --> 01:44.719
LOOK, CAN WE DO THIS LATER?

01:44.770 --> 01:47.659
MY SISTER JOY'S FLIGHT GETS
IN ANY MINUTE NOW.

01:47.700 --> 01:48.689
YOU HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME.

01:48.740 --> 01:50.731
NO I DON'T, SHAWN.

01:50.770 --> 01:52.203
YOU KNOW SHE USUALLY WORKS
DURING THE HOLIDAYS.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.174
LONDON, PARIS, HONG KONG.

01:54.210 --> 01:55.472
NOW THAT SHE'S HOME,
WE HAVE TO SPEND

01:55.510 --> 01:57.273
AS MUCH TIME TOGETHER
AS POSSIBLE.

01:57.310 --> 01:58.800
ALL THAT TIME AWAY
FROM HOME FOR WORK.

01:58.850 --> 02:00.818
PRECISELY WHY I DIDN'T GO
TO LAW SCHOOL.

02:00.850 --> 02:02.784
YEAH,
THAT AND THE SCHOOL PART.

02:02.820 --> 02:04.412
[door slams]

02:05.650 --> 02:07.379
WELL, HELLO THERE.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.721
MAY I HELP YOU?

02:09.760 --> 02:11.455
ARE YOU MR. PSYCH?

02:12.900 --> 02:15.698
I'M MR. SHAWN.
AND THIS IS SCROOGE JONES.

02:15.730 --> 02:17.163
WE'RE PSYCHIC DETECT IVES.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.462
WHO MIGHT YOU BE?

02:18.500 --> 02:19.592
MY NAME'S BRI'I'I'ANY.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.232
MR. SHAWN...

02:21.270 --> 02:22.567
I NEED TO HIRE YOU.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.931
I SEE.
WHAT FOR?

02:24.970 --> 02:26.403
TO GET SANTA OUT OF JAIL.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.875
ALL I HAVE IS $1.38.
I HOPE IT'S ENOUGH.

02:29.910 --> 02:31.241
WE COULDN'T
POSSIBLY ACCEPT THAT.

02:31.280 --> 02:35.376
HE'S RIGHT.
WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE?

02:35.420 --> 02:36.682
THE POLICEMEN DRAGGED HIM
AWAY

02:36.720 --> 02:37.709
FROM THE SANTA'S VILLAGE
IN SOLVANG.

02:37.750 --> 02:38.910
PLEASE.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.815
YOU HAVE TO HELP HIM.

02:40.860 --> 02:41.679
DON'T WORRY, BRITTANY.

02:41.720 --> 02:42.926
THERE ARE SOME
WONDERFUL PUBLIC DEFENDERS

02:42.960 --> 02:44.188
IN THE NORTH POLE.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.720
SANTA WILL BE OUT
IN NO TIME.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.227
BUT IF HE'S NOT OUT
BY CHRISTMAS EVE,

02:47.260 --> 02:49.728
HE CAN'T
DELIVER HIS TOYS.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.864
UH, THIS IS...

02:52.900 --> 02:54.731
THIS IS A MATTER
FOR THE POLICE.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.237
(Shawn)
YES.

02:56.270 --> 02:58.238
AND WE NEVER INTERFERE
WITH POLICE MATTERS.

02:58.270 --> 03:00.579
I UNDERSTAND.

03:00.610 --> 03:02.248
OKAY.
GOOD.

03:02.280 --> 03:06.512
[whimpers]

03:06.550 --> 03:10.316
[crying]

03:10.350 --> 03:11.908
OH, BOY.

03:14.390 --> 03:15.516
WHAT ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO DO

03:15.560 --> 03:17.482
WHEN A CHILD'S CRYING
LIKE THIS?

03:17.530 --> 03:19.589
YOU CAVE.

03:19.630 --> 03:21.825
BRITTANY,

03:21.860 --> 03:24.761
MR. SHAWN AND I WILL GET SANTA
OUT AS SOON AS WE GET BACK.

LET'S GO.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.445
GUS. GUS, WE'RE BACK
FROM THE AIRPORT.

03:45.550 --> 03:48.883
HEY, SIS!
AW, GUSSIE!

03:48.920 --> 03:49.921
I MISSED YOU.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.848
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

03:51.890 --> 03:52.857
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE

03:52.900 --> 03:54.128
NOT HAVING ANYONE
TO TALK TO.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.869
WELL, I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT
THIS PSYCHIC DETECTIVE AGENCY.

03:57.900 --> 04:00.266
IT'S VERY
IM PRESSIVE.

04:00.300 --> 04:01.767
AS WE FOUND OUT LAST YEAR

04:01.800 --> 04:04.633
WHEN WE WERE BOTH BROUGHT
UP ON MURDER CHARGES.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.501
I STILL FIND THAT HARD
TO BELIEVE.

04:06.540 --> 04:07.575
WELL, WE WERE
IN THE WRONG PLACE

04:07.610 --> 04:09.771
AT THE WRONG TIME.

04:09.810 --> 04:12.517
NOBODY TO BLAME.
NO.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.847
YOU TWO MUST BE PRETTY GOOD.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.653
IT'S FUNNY...

04:19.690 --> 04:21.510
I DON'T REMEMBER YOU
BEING PSYCHIC.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.857
OH...

04:22.890 --> 04:23.982
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

04:24.030 --> 04:26.453
(in unison)
HIGH SCHOOL.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.819
DID YOU TWO JUST LOOK
AT EACH OTHER?

04:27.860 --> 04:28.792
HM?

04:28.830 --> 04:30.320
(in unison)
NO.

04:30.370 --> 04:31.860
YOU JUST DID IT AGAIN.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.835
AS IF TO CORROBORATE
WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SAY.

04:34.870 --> 04:37.964
JOY, WHAT IS THIS?

04:38.010 --> 04:39.875
WE'RE NOT ON TRIAL HERE.

04:39.910 --> 04:41.639
THIS IS CHRISTMASTIME...

04:41.680 --> 04:43.045

AND IT'S LIKE "WHAT?"
BE MERRY!

04:43.080 --> 04:45.799
THIS IS
NOT A COURT ROOM.
IT'S ALL ABOUT LOVE.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.273
SO WHY ARE YOU BOTH
STRIKING DEFENSIVE POSES?

04:49.850 --> 04:50.839
UH.

04:51.820 --> 04:54.857
I WAS JUST, I WAS
KEEPING IT LOOSE.
YEAH.

04:54.890 --> 04:56.551
UM, I'M GOING
TO BE LATE TO WORK.

04:56.590 --> 04:59.627
AND DON'T FORGET, I'M
COVERING THE NIGHT SHIFT.

05:05.630 --> 05:06.767
IT'S OKAY, DADDY.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.392
LOOK, IT'LL
GIVE ME AND GUS

05:08.440 --> 05:09.930
A CHANCE TO CATCH UP.

05:09.970 --> 05:11.904
ALL RIGHT, WELL...

05:11.940 --> 05:13.498
I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING, THEN.

05:13.540 --> 05:16.031
OKAY, BYE.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.945
SWEETHEART, YOUR
ROOM'S ALL READY.

05:17.980 --> 05:19.743
AND I'LL JUST BE
A LITTLE LONGER IN THE KITCHEN.

05:19.780 --> 05:20.940
LET ME GET THIS UP

05:20.980 --> 05:22.049
TO YOUR ROOM FOR YOU.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.117
[grunts]

05:25.150 --> 05:26.583
I DOUBT YOU NEED
ALL OF THEM.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.582
OF COURSE IT IS.

08:49.160 --> 08:52.084
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE.

09:07.740 --> 09:10.846
DUDE, OUR SANTA ONLY
HAS DEFENSIVE WOUNDS.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.347
THERE'S NO WAY
HE PUT ANYBODY IN A COMA.

09:12.380 --> 09:13.779
AND I CAN TELL
FROM THAT GUY'S

09:13.820 --> 09:15.048
BRACELET
THAT HE'S A MASTER

09:15.080 --> 09:16.172
OF KRAV MAGA.

09:16.220 --> 09:17.847
HIS FISTS ARE CONSIDERED
DEADLY WEAPONS.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.585
SINCE WHEN
CAN YOU READ HEBREW?

09:19.620 --> 09:21.850
SINCE I SPENT A SUMMER WORKING
AT A HASIDIC DELI.

09:21.890 --> 09:24.620
THOSE WERE GOOD TIMES.

09:24.660 --> 09:26.958
[laughs goofily]
SHLOMO.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.729
JULES!

09:28.760 --> 09:29.829
I'M GETTING
SOMETHING HERE.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.634
I'M SEEING HANDS
FAST AS LIGHTING.

09:32.670 --> 09:34.262
IT'S MORE
THAN A LITTLE UPSETTING.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.767
KUNG FU FIGHTING.
THAT'S RIGHT.

09:35.800 --> 09:36.937
SOMEONE IN THE FIGHT
WAS A MASTER OF MARTIAL ARTS.

09:36.970 --> 09:38.335
BUT NOT SANTA.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.837
HE BRINGS PEACE AND JOY.
THAT'S RIGHT, GUS.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.768
THE MAN I'M THINKING
OF IS A LETHAL MACHINE,

09:41.810 --> 09:43.277
TRAINED IN THE MARTIAL ARTS
OF THE MIDDLE EAST,

09:43.310 --> 09:44.709
HOY!

09:44.750 --> 09:46.342
THAT'S HIM.

09:46.380 --> 09:47.517
HE'S THE ONE WHO KNOCKED
THE VICTIM UNCONSCIOUS

09:47.550 --> 09:49.074
AND HE'S THE ONE THAT SHOULD
SERVE TIME FOR ASSAULT

09:49.120 --> 09:50.087
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.815
ASSAULT?!

09:51.850 --> 09:52.987
I WAS MINDING MY
OWN BUSINESS.

09:53.020 --> 09:54.009
I ONLY HIT THAT GUY

09:54.060 --> 09:56.779
BECAUSE
I WAS DEFENDING SANTA.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.058
NICE JOB, SHAWN.

09:58.090 --> 09:59.626
YOU JUST SAVED US HOURS
OF PROCESSING.

09:59.660 --> 10:00.991
WELL CONSIDER IT
YOUR CHRISTMAS GIFT.

10:01.030 --> 10:03.362
TAKE HIM TO THE
INTERROGATION ROOM, PLEASE.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.391
AND MAKE SURE THIS ONE GETS
BACK TO SANTA'S VILLAGE

10:05.430 --> 10:07.091
TO SPREAD
SOME CHRISTMAS CHEER.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.938
THERE'S A VERY SWEET
LITTLE GIRL COUNTING ON IT.

10:09.970 --> 10:11.164
WE JUST SAVED CHRISTMAS.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.599
WHAT?

10:17.780 --> 10:19.771
SO WHEN THE CLUSTER
OF BULLETS IS VERY TIGHT,

10:19.820 --> 10:21.276
WE REFER TO THAT
AS PRECISION.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.981
NOT TO BE CONFUSED
WITH ACCURACY.

10:23.020 --> 10:24.647
WHICH HAS TO DO
WITH THE PROXIMITY

10:24.690 --> 10:26.009
TO THE INTENDED TARGET.
MM-HMM.

10:26.050 --> 10:28.757
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

10:28.790 --> 10:31.884
JUST HAVING A CONVERSATION
WITH YOUR DELIGHTFUL SISTER.

10:31.930 --> 10:32.897
REALLY?

10:32.930 --> 10:35.421
OH, LET ME GET
THAT FOR YOU.

10:35.460 --> 10:36.222
"GET THAT FOR YOU."

10:36.260 --> 10:38.660
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
THAT MEANS.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.769
SHAWN, WHAT
IS THE SENTENCE

10:39.800 --> 10:41.859
FOR ASSAULTING
A POLICE OFFICER?

10:41.900 --> 10:44.004
WHOA.
IT'S OKAY, BUDDY.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.337
SORRY, GUS IS
A LITTLE OVERPROTECT IVE

10:45.370 --> 10:46.928
OF HIS OLDER SISTER.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.777
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH YOU

10:48.810 --> 10:49.777
AND PEOPLE'S SISTERS
ANYWAY?

10:49.810 --> 10:50.777
FIRST VICK'S
AND NOW MINE?

10:50.810 --> 10:51.902
AND AREN'T YOU
STILL MARRIED?

10:51.950 --> 10:52.769
STAND DOWN, GUSTER.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.412
WE WERE SIMPLY
HAVING A CONVERSATION.

10:54.450 --> 10:55.747
GEEZ.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.714
YOU SNOW WHITE--
LASSIE...

10:57.750 --> 11:00.218
I THINK DOBSON
IS CALLING FOR YOU.

11:03.060 --> 11:05.756
REALLY NICE
TO MEET YOU.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.461
THE NERVE
OF SOME PEOPLE.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.764
YOU KNOW, GUS, HEY.

11:13.800 --> 11:14.960
I'M A BIG GIRL.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.059
AND I CAN SEE
WHOEVER I WANT, THANK YOU.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.759
NO, NOT IF
THAT PERSON'S SUPPOSED

11:18.810 --> 11:20.300
TO BE A FRIEND OF MINE,
UH-UH.

11:20.340 --> 11:21.375
HELL NO.

11:25.780 --> 11:26.872
YEAH, WELL YOU WEREN'T THERE

11:26.920 --> 11:28.717
TO SEE IT'S LITTLE FACE
LOOKING UP AT ME.

11:28.750 --> 11:31.310
MEOWING FOR MILK
AND WARMTH AND SHELTER.

11:31.350 --> 11:33.056
WERE YOU, GARTH?

11:33.090 --> 11:35.479
FINE, THANKS.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.227
APPARENTLY, MY APARTMENT
IS INFESTED WITH FLEAS.

11:38.260 --> 11:39.454
IT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE STRAY CAT

11:39.490 --> 11:40.696
THAT I TOOK IN.

11:40.730 --> 11:43.392
BUT THEY CANNOT BLAME ME FOR
INFESTING THE ENTIRE BUILDING.

11:43.430 --> 11:46.160
(in unison)
ONE ADULT FEMALE FLEA
LAYS THOUSANDS OF EGGS.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.292
WOW.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.364
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT
FRIGHTENING.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.506
I'LL NEED SOME PLACE
TO CRASH WHILE THEY FUMIGATE.

11:51.540 --> 11:52.837
I'D STAY AT MY DAD'S,
BUT HE'S GOT SOME

11:52.880 --> 11:54.438
OF HIS LODGE BUDDIES
IN TOWN.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.469
WELL, GUS AND I ARE STAYING
WITH OUR FOLKS

11:55.510 --> 11:58.707
FOR THE HOLIDAYS,
WHY DON'T YOU STAY WITH US?

12:01.020 --> 12:02.510
OH, I DON'T KNOW, JOY.

12:02.550 --> 12:03.744
SHAWN, PLEASE.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.189
THERE, IT'S SETTLED.

12:07.890 --> 12:09.755
LOOK.
WHAT IS IT?

12:09.790 --> 12:13.089
I SAVED YOUR BUTT
THIS TIME, DADDY.

12:13.130 --> 12:14.358
YOU'RE LUCKYI DIDN'T
LEAVE YOU

12:14.400 --> 12:16.095
IN THERE TO ROT.

12:17.430 --> 12:19.227
NOW WE ONLY
HAVE THREE DAYS LEFT.

12:19.270 --> 12:21.033
DON'T SCREW UP AGAIN.

12:21.070 --> 12:23.106
GEEZ.

12:23.140 --> 12:25.438
SHE'S A LITTLE CON ARTIST.

12:25.470 --> 12:31.773
I BET SHE HAD MORE
THAN $1.38 ON HER TOO.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.141
DUDE, WE GOT CONNED
ON CHRISTMAS.

12:33.180 --> 12:34.943
I DON'T LIKE HAVING MY EMOTIONS
TOYED WITH LIKE THAT.

12:36.180 --> 12:38.045
WELL, WE RAN FINGERPRINTS
ON EVERYONE.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.979
HIS NAME WAS CARL WILCOX.

12:41.020 --> 12:44.251
AND ACCORDING TO POLICE RECORDS,
HE IS A KNOWN CON MAN.

12:44.290 --> 12:46.258
NOW WE ONLY
HAVE THREE DAYS LEFT.

12:46.290 --> 12:49.862
WHATEVER IT IS, THEY MUST
BE PLANNING IT FOR THE 24TH.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.322
WE JUST NEED
TO GET PROOF.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.099
THANK YOU, JULES.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.537
YOU'RE WELCOME.

12:56.570 --> 12:59.539
[We Wish You
A Merry Christmas playing]

12:59.570 --> 13:07.875
*

13:12.390 --> 13:13.880
WHAT?

13:13.920 --> 13:16.388
WHAT?

13:19.290 --> 13:20.496
[laughs]

13:21.930 --> 13:23.295
THERE YOU GO, MA'AM.

13:23.330 --> 13:24.922
ENJOY.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.305
HO, HO, HO, HO, HO, HO!

13:32.340 --> 13:33.898
HAVE YOU BEEN GOOD
THIS YEAR?

13:33.940 --> 13:36.408
ALL RIGHT, SO
THAT WILL BE 20 WALLETS

13:36.440 --> 13:37.441
AND ONE 8 X 10.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.948
WE CAN SEND IT
TO A HOME ADDRESS.

13:39.980 --> 13:42.073
JUST CHECK THE BOX.

13:44.420 --> 13:46.308
OKAY, NOW YOU KEEP
THOSE GRADES UP.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.284
SO THAT WE CAN GIVE YOU
EVERYTHING ON YOUR LIST, OKAY?

13:48.320 --> 13:50.857
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.

13:50.890 --> 13:53.029
WHO'S NEXT IN LINE
TO SEE SANTA?

13:53.060 --> 13:55.358
EXCUSE US.
[chuckling]

13:55.400 --> 13:57.868
I DON'T THINK SANTA'S LAP
IS BIG ENOUGH FOR YOU BOYS.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.026
CUT THE CRAP, CARL.

13:59.070 --> 14:00.332
WE KNOW YOU CONNED US

14:00.370 --> 14:01.530
INTO GETTING YOU
OUT OF JAIL.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.631
OKAY, NOT HERE,
ALL RIGHT?

14:05.670 --> 14:07.433
SANTA'S GOING
TO TAKE A FIVE.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.833
BE RIGHT BACK.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.041
HEY.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.217
WHAT BLIND KID
DID YOU STEAL THAT FROM?

14:20.260 --> 14:23.320
WHY WOULD A BLIND KID
HAVE A VIDEO GAME?

14:25.060 --> 14:26.357
YOU HAVE COOTIES
ON YOUR FACE.

14:26.390 --> 14:27.288
SHAWN.
SHE STARTED IT.

14:27.330 --> 14:28.297
YOU STARTED IT.
SHE GAVE ME THE STINK EYE.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.264
SHE WAS PLAYING A VIDEO GAME.
SHE'S A LITTLE--

14:30.300 --> 14:31.494
SHAWN!
OKAY, LOOK GUYS...

14:31.530 --> 14:33.031
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU

14:33.070 --> 14:34.537
GETTING ME OUT OF JAIL,
BUT I'M WORKING HERE, OKAY?

14:34.570 --> 14:35.935
WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK

14:35.970 --> 14:38.029
WHEN WE HAVE A
LITTLE REINDEER LUNCH BREAK?

14:38.070 --> 14:39.469
OR MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO TELL US ABOUT

14:39.510 --> 14:41.478
THAT LITTLE CON YOU HAVE PLANNED
FOR THE 24TH.

14:41.510 --> 14:42.636
HERE'S THE THING,
CARL,

14:42.680 --> 14:45.478
WE'RE ON TO YOU.
BOTH OF YOU.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.449
WELL, YOU'RE TOO SMART
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

14:52.490 --> 14:53.457
...THIS GUY...

14:53.490 --> 14:55.913
DON'T HIT ME!

14:58.090 --> 15:01.059
NO.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.364
NOT SO FAST,
ST. NICK, HUH?

15:03.400 --> 15:04.662
INTERNATIONAL SIGN OF GUILT,
BUDDY.

15:08.740 --> 15:11.402
HEY, THOSE WERE THE SAME TWO
GUYS WHO I SAW CUT IN LINE.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.509
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE KIDS.

15:12.540 --> 15:14.474
THIS IS NOT GOOD.
NO.

15:14.510 --> 15:15.977
ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH OF YOU TWO.

15:16.010 --> 15:17.102
LET'S GO.
WHAT?

15:30.360 --> 15:32.726
I'VE NEVER BEEN KICKED OUT OF
SANTA'S VILLAGE BEFORE, SHAWN.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.022
YOU GET USED TO IT.

15:34.060 --> 15:35.027
I DON'T WANT
TO GET USED TO IT.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.027
IT'S HUMILIATING.

15:36.060 --> 15:36.992
WE STILL DON'T KNOW

15:37.030 --> 15:38.258
WHAT CRIME CARL
AND BRITTANY ARE PLANNING

15:38.300 --> 15:40.268
FOR CHRISTMAS EVE.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.598
GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.335
GOOD NIGHT.
'NIGHT, JOY.

15:46.710 --> 15:49.133
SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

15:51.110 --> 15:53.374
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
MOCKING US, YOU KNOW.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.444
FEELS LIKE A SLAP
IN THE FACE.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.175
AND NOT A RHETT BUTLER SLAP,

15:56.220 --> 15:59.041
AN IKE TURNER SLAP.

15:59.090 --> 16:00.751
BUT WE STILL HAVE A FEW DAYS
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

16:00.790 --> 16:04.180
LET'S JUST GO TO BED.
COOL.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.551
GOOD NIGHT, DUDE.
'NIGHT.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.536
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

16:20.540 --> 16:23.509
[Eartha Kitt's Santa Baby]

16:23.550 --> 16:29.546
*

17:39.550 --> 17:42.383

JOY.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.644
JOY.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.680
JOY.

18:17.590 --> 18:18.784
SHAWN.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.127
MR. GUSTER?

18:20.160 --> 18:21.195
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE ASLEEP.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.458
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:22.500 --> 18:25.628
I-I THOUGHT THAT I HEARD
A NOISE OR SOMETHING.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.331
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE WORKING THE NIGHT SHIFT.

18:27.370 --> 18:28.462
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?

18:28.500 --> 18:29.865
I-I FORGOT SOMETHING.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.629
OH.

18:31.670 --> 18:33.729
SO I GUESS YOU'LL
BE GOING BACK TO WORK THEN.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.341
AND I GUESS YOU, YOU'LL
BE GOING BACK TO SLEEP?

18:39.780 --> 18:41.372
WHY AREN'T YOU LEAVING?

18:41.420 --> 18:42.614
IT'S MY HOUSE, I CAN LEAVE
WHEN I WANT TO.

18:42.650 --> 18:44.311
YOU WANT TO TELL ME

18:44.350 --> 18:46.682
WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR DOWN HERE?

18:51.690 --> 18:54.853
OH, I'M GETTING
SOMETHING HERE.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.368
YOU WEREN'T AT WORK
LIKE YOU SAID YOU WERE.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.233
I SEE A PROJECTOR,
A MOVIE PROJECTOR.

19:00.270 --> 19:01.464
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BE READING ME.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.467
YES.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.467
UH-UH.
NO, NO.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.330
OH, PLEASE,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

19:05.370 --> 19:06.735
STICK A MOVE,
STICK A MOVE.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.533
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

19:08.580 --> 19:09.933
I'VE ALREADY HAD
THE VISION.

19:09.980 --> 19:13.438
IT'S OVER, THE VISION IS OVER,
I'VE HAD IT, IT'S DONE.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.715
YOU LIED TO YOUR FAMILY
ABOUT WORKING THE NIGHT SHIFT.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.685
TRUTH IS, I...

19:20.720 --> 19:24.759
I LOST MY JOB
AT RAYTHEON A MONTH AGO.

19:24.790 --> 19:27.759
OH, I'M SORRY.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.688
WHY ARE YOU
KEEPING IT A SECRET?

19:29.730 --> 19:32.722
IT'S CHRISTMASTIME.
JOY'S HOME.

19:32.770 --> 19:36.194
I DIDN'T WANT EVERYBODY
TO WORRY.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.630
SO I GO OUT ON INTERVIEWS
ALL THROUGH THE DAY.

19:39.670 --> 19:42.377
AND HANG OUT
AT THE MOVIES

19:42.410 --> 19:43.604
OR A COFFEE SHOP
AT NIGHT.

19:43.650 --> 19:47.347

I'M DOING MY NIGHT SHIFT.

19:47.380 --> 19:48.347
REMEMBER.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.711
THIS IS BETWEEN
ME AND YOU

19:49.750 --> 19:51.741
AND THAT LAMP OVER THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

19:51.790 --> 19:53.678
YOU'RE SAYING THE LAWN CHAIR
ISN'T TRUSTWORTHY--

19:53.720 --> 19:54.914
OH, BE SERIOUS, BOY!
ALL RIGHT.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.518
SO, WE'RE COOL, RIGHT?

19:56.560 --> 19:57.720
WE'LL COOL, MR. G.
YEAH.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.455
I WOULD HATE TO THINK
THAT THINGS CHANGED

19:59.490 --> 20:00.593
BECAUSE YOU
BETRAYED MY TRUST.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.689
BELIEVE ME...

20:02.730 --> 20:04.698
YOU, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

20:08.940 --> 20:10.737
THE PROBLEM IS,
CARL ALREADY KNOWS

20:10.770 --> 20:11.668
WE'RE ON TO HIM.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.938
HE'S NOT GOING
TO LET US GET CLOSE ENOUGH

20:12.970 --> 20:13.937
TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT HE'S UP TO.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.676
UNLESS...

20:16.710 --> 20:17.677
YOU GUYS READY

20:17.710 --> 20:18.745
TO GRAB LUNCH?

20:18.780 --> 20:19.542
(Gus)
GOOD IDEA.

20:19.580 --> 20:20.808
YOU COULD
USE A PICK-ME-UP.

20:20.850 --> 20:22.010
(Shawn)
I'M SORRY, MAN.

20:22.050 --> 20:23.745
I DIDN'T GET A LOT
OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

20:23.790 --> 20:24.745
UNLESS...

20:24.790 --> 20:26.382
OF COURSE WE COULD FIGURE
OUT A WAY TO SNOOP

20:26.420 --> 20:28.308
AROUND SANTA'S VILLAGE
WITHOUT CARL KNOWING.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.315
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT?

20:29.360 --> 20:30.952
I CAN HELP.

20:40.570 --> 20:42.299
WELCOME ABOARD.
THANK YOU.

20:42.340 --> 20:43.534
WE CAN USE
ALL THE HELP

20:43.570 --> 20:45.458
WE CAN GET
FOR THE CHRISTMAS RUSH.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.603
YES, OKAY.

20:59.090 --> 21:00.580
LET'S GO.

21:04.790 --> 21:06.883
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

21:06.930 --> 21:09.922
GREAT JOB.
THANK YOU.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.496
MAKE SURE YOU SIGN UP
FOR CARL'S SHIFT.
OKAY.

21:11.530 --> 21:12.519
STAY CLOSE TO HIM.

21:12.570 --> 21:13.537
LET US KNOW
WHAT YOU FIND OUT.

21:13.570 --> 21:14.594
WE'LL PICK YOU
UP LATER.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.698
I'M ON IT.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.800
WHAT THE HECK
YOU LOOKING AT?

21:21.840 --> 21:25.378
THAT IS
A BEAUTIFUL WREATH.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.741
I HEAR THAT.

21:38.960 --> 21:39.858
SO?

21:39.890 --> 21:41.721
DID CARL REALIZE
YOU WERE CHECKING UP ON HIM?

21:41.760 --> 21:43.523
HE DIDN'T SUSPECT A THING.

21:43.570 --> 21:44.798
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

21:44.830 --> 21:45.762
I'M SORRY GUYS,

21:45.800 --> 21:47.461
BUT CARL SEEMS LIKE
HE'S ON THE UP AND UP.

21:47.500 --> 21:50.469
YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM TALKING
WITH ANY SHADY CHARACTERS?

21:50.510 --> 21:51.738
NO, JUST THE KIDS.

21:51.770 --> 21:53.738
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
HE'S A PRETTY GOOD SANTA.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.429
I MEAN, HE JUST DOESN'T
ASK THEM WHAT THEY WANT,

21:55.480 --> 21:57.539
HE ASKS THE KIDS WHAT
THEY LIKE MOST ABOUT CHRISTMAS,

21:57.580 --> 21:59.002
WHAT THEY'RE
MOST THANKFUL FOR,

21:59.050 --> 22:00.938
WHAT RELATIVES
THEY'RE GOING TO VISIT.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.379
IT'S QUITE TOUCHING.

22:02.420 --> 22:04.786
SO THAT'LL BE 20 WALLETS
AND ONE 8 X 10.

22:04.820 --> 22:06.481
WE CAN SEND IT
TO A HOME ADDRESS,

22:06.520 --> 22:09.080
JUST CHECK THE BOX.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.656
WAIT A MINUTE, THAT'S IT.

22:10.690 --> 22:12.658
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

22:12.690 --> 22:13.588
ARE YOU HAVING A VISION?

22:13.630 --> 22:16.895
IT'S A SMALL, IT'S A SMALL--
TINY VISION.

22:16.930 --> 22:18.090
OH.

22:18.130 --> 22:19.495
COLD SHOWER,
BASEBALL STATS,

22:19.530 --> 22:20.929
WATCHING MY GRANDMOTHER
EAT MEATLOAF.

22:20.970 --> 22:22.892
SHAWN.
I SEE CARL AND TED.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.407
STANDING IN FRONT
OF A COMPUTER SCREEN,

22:24.440 --> 22:26.761
UH, IT'S A LIST
OF ADDRESSES.

22:26.810 --> 22:28.505
GETTING THE INFORMATION
FROM THE KIDS

22:28.540 --> 22:29.905
ABOUT WHO'S TRAVELING
OVER THE HOLIDAYS

22:29.940 --> 22:31.498
GIVES THEM A BUILT-IN LIST

22:31.550 --> 22:32.801
OF EMPTY HOUSES TO ROB.

22:32.850 --> 22:33.919
THAT'S WHY HE HAD TO BE
OUT OF JAIL

22:33.950 --> 22:34.917
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

22:34.950 --> 22:36.110
WE NEED
TO WARN THE POLICE

22:36.150 --> 22:37.412
BEFORE TOMORROW.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.959
WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

22:41.990 --> 22:44.026
THAT.

22:44.060 --> 22:45.482
LOOK HOW CUTE
THAT LITTLE SNOWMAN IS.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.452
I HEAR THAT.

22:49.530 --> 22:51.669
(Shawn)
HIS CAR'S STILL HERE,
SO WHERE'S CARL?

22:59.710 --> 23:00.802
NOT A CREATU RE
WAS STIRRING,

23:00.840 --> 23:02.501
NOT EVEN A MOUSE.

23:02.540 --> 23:04.599
MUCH LESS A ROBBER.
REALLY?

23:04.650 --> 23:05.901
NO ONE IS HERE?

23:05.950 --> 23:08.475
NOT A SINGLE PERSON?
HELLO?

23:08.520 --> 23:09.839
GREAT.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.745
THANKS FOR DRAGGING US
OUT HERE FOR NOTHING, SPENCER.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.418
YOU'RE SURE YOU SENSED SOMETHING
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT?

23:14.460 --> 23:15.586
MAYBE WE JUST MISSED THEM.

23:15.620 --> 23:16.985
WE COULD TRY AND FIGURE
OUT WHICH HOUSES

23:17.020 --> 23:18.123
THEY WERE PLANNING
ON ROBBING.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.628
WHAT DO YOU DO, JUST RANDOMLY
START KNOCKING ON DOORS?

23:20.660 --> 23:23.788
WE'VE GOT BETTER THINGS
TO DO, COME ON, O'HARA.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.036
HOW OFTEN ARE
YOU WRONG LIKE THIS?

23:29.070 --> 23:31.709
NOT OFTEN.
OFTEN.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.075
AS USUAL...

23:37.110 --> 23:39.943
THEY NEGLECTED TO MAKE ONE
OF THE WISE MEN BLACK.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.789
ABOUT BALTHAZAR.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.831
[high-pitched scream]

24:04.870 --> 24:06.758
[screaming]

24:11.180 --> 24:12.704
IT'S TED.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.008
WE'RE NOT DEALING
WITH CON ARTISTS,

24:23.060 --> 24:24.948
WE'RE DEALING WITH MURDERERS.

24:31.230 --> 24:32.959
THANK YOU
FOR COMING, MR. SPENCER.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.798
NOW THAT THIS HAS
BECOME A MURDER CASE,

24:35.840 --> 24:37.159
WE'RE AMPING
UP THE INVESTIGATION.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.009
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
THE CITY WANTS PEOPLE

24:39.040 --> 24:40.871
TO FEEL SAFE
THIS HOLIDAY SEASON.

24:40.910 --> 24:42.002
WE BROUGHT CARL
INTO CUSTODY THIS MORNING.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.007
BRITTANY'S
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM

24:43.040 --> 24:44.177
WITH CHILD
PROTECTIVE SERVICES.

24:44.210 --> 24:45.177
SO FAR WE HAVEN'T
FOUND ANYTHING

24:45.210 --> 24:46.279
TO LINK CARL
TO THE MURDER.

24:46.310 --> 24:47.641
SO TECH NICALLY,
WE CAN ONLY CHARGE HIM

24:47.680 --> 24:49.147
WITH CONSPIRACY
TO COMMIT BURGLARY.

24:49.180 --> 24:50.909
BUT WE'RE WILLING
TO RECOMMEND THAT THE D.A.

24:50.950 --> 24:53.282
CUT A DEAL IF HE COOPERATES
IN THE MURDER INVESTIGATION.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.548
DID HE TAKE?

24:54.590 --> 24:56.285
HE SAYS HE'LL ONLY TALK
TO YOU GUYS.

24:56.320 --> 24:59.221
SO I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT YOU CAN GET OUT OF HIM.

24:59.260 --> 25:00.955
LET'S CLOSE THE BOOK
ON THIS ONE, PRONTO.

25:04.930 --> 25:06.818
I--I ADMIT IT.

25:06.870 --> 25:09.896
THE SANTA JOB WAS JUST
A LONG CON

25:09.940 --> 25:10.929
TO ROB SOME PEOPLE, OKAY?

25:10.970 --> 25:12.608
BUT YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME,

25:12.640 --> 25:14.232
I-I COULD NEVER
HAVE KILLED TED.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.235
I KNOW.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.976
TED WAS YOUR INSIDE MAN.

25:19.910 --> 25:21.912
I KEPT THAT FROM THE POLICE.

25:23.650 --> 25:25.982
TED AND I WERE PARTNERS
FOR A LONG TIME.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.578
WE SCAMMED PEOPLE ALL
UP AND DOWN THE COAST.

25:27.620 --> 25:28.814
BUT WE WERE JUST CON MEN.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.589
WE NEVER
PHYSICALLY HURT ANYBODY.

25:30.630 --> 25:31.858
THAT WASN'T OUR THING.

25:35.860 --> 25:38.727
LISTEN, WHOEVER IT WAS
THAT KILLED TED...

25:38.770 --> 25:40.567
MIGHT BE COMING
AFTER ME NEXT.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.567
OR EVEN WORSE

25:41.600 --> 25:42.635
AFTER BRITTANY.

25:42.670 --> 25:43.659
I DON'T TRUST THE COPS

25:43.710 --> 25:45.268
TO PROTECT US.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.902
YOU GOT TO STOP THEM.

25:46.940 --> 25:48.931
HOW CAN WE BELIEVE
ANYTHING YOU SAY, CARL?

25:48.980 --> 25:50.174
(Gus)
FOOL US ONCE,
SHAME ON YOU.

25:50.210 --> 25:51.871
FOOL US TWICE,
SHAME ON US.

25:51.910 --> 25:53.070
FOOL US TH RICE

25:53.110 --> 25:55.317
MAKES AN ASS OUT
OF "U" AND "ME."
NOPE.

25:55.350 --> 25:56.874
WE'RE SOON PARTED?

25:56.920 --> 25:58.319
THAT'S A FOOL AND
HIS MONEY.
WHAT A FOOL BELIEVES?

25:58.350 --> 25:59.783
SHAWN.
LOOK!

25:59.820 --> 26:01.253
IF THEY KILL ME,
THEY'RE JUST GOING

26:01.290 --> 26:03.053
TO THROW BRITTANY BACK
IN THE SYSTEM.

26:03.090 --> 26:04.887
NOW SHE'S A TOUGH
LITTLE GIRL,

26:04.930 --> 26:05.885
BUT SHE'S ALREADY BEEN
THROUGH A LOT, ALL RIGHT?

26:05.930 --> 26:07.818
AND I'M ALL SHE'S GOT.

26:07.860 --> 26:08.895
SORRY, MAN.

26:08.930 --> 26:11.228
WE DON'T TRUST YOU AS FAR
AS GUS CAN THROW YOU.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.564
WELL, NOW WE KNOW WHERE BRITTANY
GOT THIS LITTLE TRICK.

26:22.340 --> 26:26.276
OH, DUDE, I THINK
HE'S REALLY CRYING.

26:26.310 --> 26:28.016
SHAWN,

26:28.050 --> 26:30.041
YOU KNOW I CAN'T HANDLE IT
WHEN A GROWN MAN CRIES.

26:31.820 --> 26:33.185
I'M A SYMPATHETIC CRIER.

26:33.220 --> 26:35.711
WHAT?

26:41.730 --> 26:43.288
OKAY, FINE.
FINE.

26:43.330 --> 26:45.025
WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.197
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
TO COOPERATE FULLY.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.367
OTHERWISE WE'LL
HAVE YOU DRAGGED RIGHT

26:48.400 --> 26:50.231
BACK IN HERE
FOR THIS CHRISTMAS CON.

26:50.270 --> 26:51.635
DEAL, THANK YOU.

26:51.670 --> 26:54.776
STOP IT.

26:54.810 --> 26:55.572
DO YOU KNOW WHO MAY

26:55.610 --> 26:57.100
HAVE WANTED
TO HURT YOU OR TED?

26:57.140 --> 27:00.815
WE MIGHT'VE KIND OF OWED SOMEONE
A LITTLE MONEY.

27:00.850 --> 27:02.215
HOW ABOUT YOU BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC?

27:02.250 --> 27:03.649
WE WERE INTO OUR BOOKIE
FOR TEN GRAND.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.339
THAT'S WHY WE WERE GOING
TO DO THE ROBBERIES.

27:05.390 --> 27:07.654
DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE CAN
FIND THIS BOOKIE?

27:07.690 --> 27:10.955
FRANK WORKS AT TWO BARS.

27:10.990 --> 27:13.925
O'NEILS AND THE WILD OX.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.190
SWEET.

27:16.230 --> 27:18.289
WE'LL HAVE
TO SPLIT UP.

27:18.330 --> 27:21.390
YOU IN THE MOOD
FOR HEPATITIS A OR C?

27:25.940 --> 27:28.875
EXCUSE ME, WHERE'S FRANK?

27:44.060 --> 27:46.881
ALL RIGHT,
GET ME TEN ON

27:46.930 --> 27:48.454
"DO NOT RESUSCITATE"
IN THE FIFTH RACE.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.127
I DON'T HAVE ANY CASH BUT
GIVE ME YOUR PAYPAL ACCOUNT

27:50.160 --> 27:52.094
AND I'LL MAKE A
SECURE DEPOSIT ONLINE.

27:52.130 --> 27:54.837
SOME KIND OF JOKE?

27:54.870 --> 27:56.030
MAYBE I SHOULD
INTRODUCE MYSELF.

27:56.070 --> 27:59.699
SHAWN SPENCER,
PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

27:59.740 --> 28:01.037
I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
A COUPLE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS,

28:01.080 --> 28:04.709
NAMELY, CARL AND TED.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.001
WELL, I HOPE IT'S
ABOUT THOSE TWO BUMS

28:06.050 --> 28:07.745
PAYING ME THE MONEY
THEY OWE ME.

28:07.780 --> 28:09.475
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH
FOR TED TO PAY YOU BACK.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.988
SEEING AS HOW
HE'S DEAD AND EVERYTHING.

28:12.020 --> 28:13.339
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

28:13.390 --> 28:14.709
LAST NIGHT.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.057
AS IF YOU DIDN'T
ALREADY KNOW.

28:16.090 --> 28:17.751
COME ON, FRANK,
I KNOW THE GAME.

28:17.790 --> 28:20.452
SOMEBODY LOSES BIG, THEY
CAN'T COME UP WITH THE CASH,

28:20.490 --> 28:21.923
YOU GOT
TO SEND A LITTLE MESSAGE.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.154
ISN'T THAT THE CODE?

28:23.200 --> 28:25.794
THERE'S A BIGGER CODE
THAN THAT.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.320
DEAD MEN DON'T PAY
BACK DEBTS.

28:27.370 --> 28:29.463
INJURED MEN DO.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.036
SO I'M NOT YOUR GUY.

28:31.070 --> 28:32.765
BESIDES...

28:32.810 --> 28:34.209
THERE'S A BAR ROOM FULL
OF WITNESSES THAT CAN VOUCH

28:34.240 --> 28:37.107
FOR MY WHEREABOUTS
LAST NIGHT.

28:37.140 --> 28:40.007
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

28:40.050 --> 28:42.143
A PAYING CUSTOMER
HAS JUST ARRIVED.

28:42.180 --> 28:43.886
FINE.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.888
THAT'S WEIRD.

28:50.090 --> 28:51.318
MRS. G?
[965%]

28:51.360 --> 28:52.952
WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

28:52.990 --> 28:54.924
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS GUY DOES?

28:54.960 --> 28:56.450
OH, THIS IS
SO EMBARRASSING.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.798
UM, SHAWN,

28:58.830 --> 29:01.435
I'VE RECENTLY
MADE THE FIRST

29:01.470 --> 29:03.358
AND THE ONLY BET
IN MY LIFE.

29:03.400 --> 29:06.437
BUT YOU'RE GUS' MOM,
FOR GOODNESS SAKES.

29:06.470 --> 29:08.233
I KNOW,
I KNOW.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.339
AND NORMALLY
GAMBLING ISN'T

29:10.380 --> 29:12.075
SOMETHING THAT
I WOULD APPROVE OF,

29:12.110 --> 29:14.169
SUSAN IN ACCOUNTING HAS
THIS COUSIN, JEFF--

29:14.220 --> 29:15.346
NICE GUY--

29:15.380 --> 29:16.142
HE KNOWS SOMEONE

29:16.180 --> 29:18.444
WHO KNOWS SOMEONE
WHO KNOWS FRANK.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.446
I ALREADY TOLD YOU
THIS, FRANK.

29:20.490 --> 29:22.355
I WASN'T LISTENING.

29:22.390 --> 29:25.553
ANYWAY, IT ALL SEEMED
LIKE FATE AT THE TIME.

29:25.590 --> 29:27.956
UNTIL I LOST.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.093
OH. OH, I FELT TERRIBLE.

29:30.130 --> 29:31.995
AND I LEARNED
A VALUABLE LESSON

29:32.030 --> 29:33.395
ABOUT THE PERILS
OF GAMBLING.

29:33.430 --> 29:36.968
LONG STORY SHORT...

29:37.000 --> 29:39.230
I LOST MY
CHRISTMAS MONEY.

29:44.580 --> 29:46.400
SHAWN.

29:46.450 --> 29:48.918
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE NOT
TO TELL MY HUSBAND.

29:48.950 --> 29:51.248
I DON'T WANT HIM TO KNOW
ABOUT MY SECRET VICE.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.541
OH, MRS. G...

29:52.590 --> 29:55.150
FIRST OF ALL, ONE TIME
IS NOT A VICE.

29:55.190 --> 29:56.885
IT WAS A MOMENTARY LAPSE
IN JUDGMENT.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.922
MAYBE A "JONES."

29:58.960 --> 30:00.382
SECONDLY, I AM
PSYCHICALLY DETECTING

30:00.430 --> 30:02.193
THAT MR. GUSTER
WILL NOT BE ANGRY

30:02.230 --> 30:04.596
WITH YOU FOR KEEPING A SECRET
FROM THE FAMILY.

30:04.630 --> 30:07.269
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.202
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING UP?

30:16.240 --> 30:18.299
IT'S BARELY LIGHT OUTSIDE.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.442
HAVE A SEAT, DEAR.

30:19.480 --> 30:21.141
WOW.

30:21.180 --> 30:22.272
CHRISTMAS AT MY HOUSE
NEVER STARTS 'TIL

30:22.320 --> 30:23.548
AFTER THE FOOTBALL GAME.

30:23.580 --> 30:28.153
WELL, YOU'RE JUST
IN TIME TO OPEN PRESENTS.

30:28.190 --> 30:29.282
AW.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.150
GEE, I WONDER IF SANTA
PUT MONEY IN OUR STOCKINGS

30:30.190 --> 30:31.953
EVEN THOUGH HE KNOWS
WE DON'T NEED IT.

30:33.230 --> 30:35.255
HEY, WHERE'S MY
CHRISTMAS MONEY?

30:35.300 --> 30:37.495
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO THAT.

30:37.530 --> 30:39.327
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
THIS HANDLED.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.167
WITH ME WORKING THE NIGHT
SHIFT, I DIDN'T HAVE TIME--

30:41.200 --> 30:42.599
I HAVE BEEN COOKING,
CLEANING,

30:42.640 --> 30:45.837
GETTING THE HOUSE READY,
I'VE BEEN SWAMPED.

30:47.510 --> 30:49.535
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.

30:49.580 --> 30:52.447
HONEY, I MADE
A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.970
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT GAMBLING.

30:54.020 --> 30:57.012
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR IT
IN THE GUSTER HOUSE, BUT...

30:57.050 --> 30:59.211
I PLACED A BET WITH A BOOKIE

30:59.250 --> 31:01.252
AND I LOST
ALL MY SPENDING MONEY.

31:01.290 --> 31:02.655
OH, WINNIE!

31:02.690 --> 31:04.658
MOM!
YOU KNOW HOW
TO FIND A BOOKIE?

31:04.690 --> 31:08.057
I AM SORRY.
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.193
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

31:10.230 --> 31:13.393
WINNIE GUSTER
PLACED A BET.

31:19.510 --> 31:23.173
OH HONEY, OF COURSE
WE FORGIVE YOU.

31:23.210 --> 31:24.438
COME HERE.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.245
IN FACT,

31:31.290 --> 31:33.246
YOU'VE INSPIRED ME
TO COME CLEAN

31:33.290 --> 31:34.552
ABOUT SOMETHING, TOO.

31:34.590 --> 31:36.979
[clears throat]

31:37.020 --> 31:39.227
I, UH...

31:39.260 --> 31:43.026
I GOT LAID OFF
OF MY JOB A MONTH AGO.

31:43.060 --> 31:45.460
BEFORE YOU
ALL START WORRYING, IT'S OKAY.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.263
I'VE ALREADY GOT A COUPLE
OF CALL BACKS

31:47.300 --> 31:48.335
FOR SOME INTERVIEWS.

31:48.370 --> 31:49.234
I JUST COULDN'T
BRING MYSELF

31:49.270 --> 31:51.568
TO ADMIT IT
TO YOU GUYS.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.237
OH, DADDY.

31:53.270 --> 31:55.306
YOU KNOW YOU COULD'VE
COME TO US.

31:55.340 --> 31:56.329
YEAH, I MEAN...

31:56.380 --> 31:58.405
LAYOFFS ARE COMMON IN
THIS ECONOMY, WE UNDERSTAND.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.271
OH SWEETHEART, YOU'LL
ALWAYS BE A GOOD PROVIDER.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.470
YEAH.
THANK YOU.

32:06.290 --> 32:08.178
HEY. HEY YOU, DOWN THERE.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.380
YOU DESERVE SOME
OF THIS.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.125
OH, NO.
OH, YES.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.422
IT WAS SHAWN
WHO HELPED ME REALIZE

32:14.460 --> 32:17.293
THAT I COULD TRUST YOU GUYS
WITH THE TRUTH.

32:17.330 --> 32:18.399
YES, HE WAS THERE
WHEN I NEEDED HIM, TOO.

32:18.430 --> 32:20.295
COME ON UP HERE, BOY.

32:20.330 --> 32:22.696
OKAY.

32:22.740 --> 32:25.129
GROUP HUG.

32:25.170 --> 32:26.398
GROUP HUG.

32:27.710 --> 32:29.473
WHAT?

32:29.510 --> 32:31.068
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO CONFESS, TOO.

32:31.110 --> 32:32.338
WELL ACTUALLY,
SHAWN AND I DO.

32:32.380 --> 32:33.677
NO, WE DON'T.

32:33.710 --> 32:34.677
YES, WE DO.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.119
NO, WE DON'T.
PLEASE, NO.

32:36.150 --> 32:40.416
WE HAD A ROMANTIC
TRYST TEN YEARS AGO.

32:40.450 --> 32:42.509
JUST A LITTLE
SOMETHING SOMETHING.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.380
BUT WITH EVERYONE'S
BLESSING, WE WOULD LIKE

32:44.430 --> 32:47.126
TO PICK UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.388
YOU FOOLED AROUND
WITH MY SISTER?

32:48.430 --> 32:50.455
PLEASE DON'T SAY
"FOOLED AROUND"

32:50.500 --> 32:52.058
THAT MAKES IT SOUND
SO DIRTY.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.534
ONE TIME TEN YEARS AGO,
YOU WERE OFF AT COLLEGE.

32:54.570 --> 32:55.639
JUST BECAUSE
I'M NOT HERE,

32:55.670 --> 32:56.989
DOESN'T MAKE HER
NOT MY SISTER.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.735
OR OUR BABY GIRL.

32:58.770 --> 33:00.101
POINT OF INFORMATION:

33:00.140 --> 33:01.607
I'M NOT A BABY.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.403
(in unison)
SHH!

33:03.440 --> 33:05.408
WHAT HAPPENED TO
ALL THE LOVE AND FORGIVENESS

33:05.450 --> 33:07.372
FROM JUST A SECOND AGO?

33:07.410 --> 33:08.775
OH.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.118
MY MISTAKE WASN'T
THIS BAD.

33:11.150 --> 33:13.209
WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE...

33:13.250 --> 33:15.309
ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT MY MISTAKE
WAS WORSE THAN YOURS?

33:15.360 --> 33:16.486
'CAUSE YOURS WAS A LOT WORSE.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.624
EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A JOB.

33:18.660 --> 33:20.548
I KNEW IT!
I KNEW IT WAS COMING.

33:20.590 --> 33:22.353
WHO LOSES A JOB
AFTER 35 YEARS?

33:22.400 --> 33:23.753
YOU SEE?

33:23.800 --> 33:25.427
THAT'S WHY YOU LOST
ALL YOUR LITTLE MONEY.

33:25.470 --> 33:28.735
GOD DON'T LIKE UGLY.

33:28.770 --> 33:30.738
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.

33:30.770 --> 33:33.261
OH, HA...

33:33.310 --> 33:35.608
OH, NO HE DIDN'T.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.438
OH, NO HE DID NOT.

33:38.480 --> 33:39.549
WAIT A SECOND.

33:39.580 --> 33:40.569
I'M THE ONE THAT
SHOULD BE UPSET HERE.

33:40.610 --> 33:41.816
EVERYONE IN HERE
WAS LYING TO ME.

33:41.850 --> 33:43.408
GROW UP!

33:43.450 --> 33:47.045
I CAN'T SEE WHO I WANT
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT.

33:47.090 --> 33:49.456
YOU FOOLED AROUND
WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

33:49.490 --> 33:50.388
YOU'LL DO WHATEVER
YOU CAN JUST

33:50.420 --> 33:52.422
TO BE THE CENTER
OF ATTENTION WON'T YOU?

33:52.460 --> 33:54.098
FOREHEAD.
EARS.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.262
WHAT?

33:59.300 --> 34:01.234
I'M SO SORRY--
GOODBYE, SHAWN.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.429
YEAH, YEAH, SHRIMP.
I GOT IT.

34:09.480 --> 34:10.469
I'M COMING, I'M COMING.

34:10.510 --> 34:11.340
HEY DAD,
MERRY CHRISTMAS?

34:11.380 --> 34:12.574
HEY SHAWN, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE STAYING

34:12.610 --> 34:13.645
OVER AT THE GUSTERS.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.272
YEAH, WELL I KIND OF,
SORT OF

34:15.320 --> 34:17.311
RUINED CHRISTMAS
AT THAT HOUSE.

34:17.350 --> 34:21.252
WHAT'D YOU DO
THIS TIME?

34:21.290 --> 34:25.329
GUS' SISTER AND I SORT OF HOOKED
UP A WHILE BACK,

34:25.360 --> 34:27.726
AND FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON,

34:27.760 --> 34:29.455
SHE ANNOUNCED IT
TO THE WHOLE FAMILY.

34:29.500 --> 34:33.163
AND NOW GUS IS PISSED.
AND HE'S KICKING PEOPLE OUT.

34:33.200 --> 34:35.361
YEAH, WELL FOOLING AROUND
WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND'S SISTER

34:35.400 --> 34:37.197
CERTAINLY WASN'T
YOUR MOST BRILLIANT IDEA.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.867
NO, THAT WAS THE TOASTER ALARM
I INVENTED

34:38.910 --> 34:40.400
IN THE THIRD GRADE,
THAT WOKE YOU UP

34:40.440 --> 34:42.829
BY SMACKING YOU IN THE FACE
WITH A WAFFLE.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.700
I THINK I PEAKED TOO SOON.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.139
LOOK SHAWN, OF COURSE GUS
IS GOING TO OVERREACT.

34:47.180 --> 34:49.171
HE'S MORE
THAN JUST YOUR FRIEND,

34:49.220 --> 34:50.278
HE'S YOUR PARTNER.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.287
THERE'S A SPECIAL KIND
OF TRUST THERE.

34:51.320 --> 34:52.241
WHEN YOU FIND OUT

34:52.290 --> 34:53.712
THAT YOU'VE BEEN LIED
TO BY YOUR PARTNER,

34:53.750 --> 34:57.151
YOU GET ANGRY.

34:57.190 --> 34:59.886
I SAW IT ON THE FORCE
ALL THE TIME.

34:59.930 --> 35:02.421
WE SCAMMED PEOPLE ALL
UP AND DOWN THE COAST.

35:03.430 --> 35:04.590
DAD, THAT'S IT.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.726
THAT'S IT!

35:06.770 --> 35:08.397
I BET CARL AND TED
HAVE ANOTHER PARTNER.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.589
WHAT?
CARL AND TED?

35:09.640 --> 35:10.834
HOW MANY RELATIVES
DO THE GUSTERS HAVE?

35:10.870 --> 35:15.204
I GOT TO GO, I HAVE
A BREAK IN THE CASE.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.174
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
WHERE'S THE SHRIMP?

35:17.210 --> 35:19.303
YEAH, YEAH.

35:19.350 --> 35:20.499
I'M SORRY
FOR TAKING YOU AWAY

35:20.550 --> 35:22.313
FROM YOUR FAMILY
ON CHRISTMAS, JULES.

35:22.350 --> 35:25.478
OH, IT'S FINE.
WHERE'S GUS?

35:25.520 --> 35:26.885
WE HAD A FIGHT.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.148
[gaSPSJ

35:28.190 --> 35:29.316
HE TOTALLY OVERREACT ED.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.385
BACK IN THE DAY,
HIS SISTER AND I HAD

35:31.430 --> 35:33.819
THIS TEENIE,
WEENIE LITTLE...

35:33.860 --> 35:34.827
FLING.

35:34.860 --> 35:35.929
EW.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.427
YOU'RE GOING
TO TAKE HIS SIDE.

35:37.460 --> 35:38.358
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.368
I'M JUST SAYING
IT'S A LITTLE INAPPROPRIATE.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.799
DON'T WORRY, IT WAS WAY
BEFORE I KNEW YOU.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.932
WHY WOULD THAT MATTER?

35:42.970 --> 35:44.528
IT MIGHT.
IT DOESN'T.

35:44.570 --> 35:45.798
IT COULD.
IT WON'T.

35:48.540 --> 35:51.270
LET'S CARRY ON.

35:51.310 --> 35:52.902
SO I PULLED ALL OF CARL
AND TED'S COURT RECORDS

35:52.950 --> 35:54.372
FROM ACROSS THE STATE
LIKE YOU SAID.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.638
YOUR PSYCHIC SENSE
ABOUT THEM WAS RIGHT.

35:56.680 --> 35:57.942
LOOK AT THIS.

35:57.980 --> 36:00.380
TEN YEARS AGO
IN FRESNO, CARL AND TED

36:00.420 --> 36:03.480
TURNED STATES' EVIDENCE
IN AN ASSAULT AND ROBBERY CASE.

36:03.520 --> 36:05.886
THEY IMPLICATED SOMEONE
NAMED MONCRIEF JOHNSON.

36:05.930 --> 36:07.488
SEE, I KNEW I HAD HEARD
THAT NAME BEFORE,

36:07.530 --> 36:09.191
BUT I THOUGHT IT
WAS THE BLACK QUARTERBACK

36:09.230 --> 36:11.266
THAT REPLACED WOODY HARRELSON
IN WILDCATS.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.289
AND THEN I REMEMBERED...

36:12.330 --> 36:14.639
HE WAS THE GUY

36:14.670 --> 36:19.300
WHO WAS KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS
IN THE FIGHT AT THE MALL.

36:19.340 --> 36:21.376
IT WAS THE SAME FIGHT CARL
WAS INVOLVED IN.

36:21.410 --> 36:22.331
AND GUESS WHAT ELSE?

36:22.380 --> 36:24.439
HE WAS RELEASED FROM
THE HOSPITAL THE SAME DAY

36:24.480 --> 36:25.640
THAT TED'S BODY WAS FOUND
AT THE MALL.

36:27.380 --> 36:29.268
WE NEVER
PHYSICALLY HURT ANYONE.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.378
THAT WASN'T OUR THING.

36:30.420 --> 36:32.285
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.639
I'M GETTING SOMETHING HERE.

36:33.690 --> 36:35.749
CARL AND TED TURNED STATES'
EVIDENCE

36:35.790 --> 36:37.553
BECAUSE HE STARTED
USING VIOLENCE.

36:37.590 --> 36:39.251
WHICH WASN'T THEIR M.O.

36:39.290 --> 36:40.826
MONCRIEF WASN'T AN INNOCENT
VICTIM IN THE FIGHT AT THE MALL.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.327
HE STARTED IT.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.452
CARL DIDN'T REALIZE
HE HAD GOTTEN OUT

36:43.500 --> 36:46.219
OF PRISON AND
WAS HUNTING HIM DOWN.

36:46.270 --> 36:48.761
BUT THE KRAV MAGA
EXPERT KNOCKED HIM OUT

36:48.800 --> 36:51.268
BEFORE HE COULD GET
TO CARL.

36:55.340 --> 36:57.331
WHEN MONCRIEF GOT
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL,

36:57.380 --> 36:58.574
HE PICKED UP
RIGHT WHERE HE LEFT OFF.

36:58.610 --> 37:00.908
ONLY THIS TIME,
HE DIDN'T RELY ON HIS FISTS.

37:00.950 --> 37:01.939
HE'S PROBABLY GOING
TO MAKE HIS MOVE

37:01.980 --> 37:03.675
BEFORE CARL CAN GET
AWAY AGAIN.

37:03.720 --> 37:06.883
YOU CALL LASSIE,
I HAVE TO WARN CARL.

37:11.060 --> 37:14.029
[foreboding music]

37:14.060 --> 37:20.260
*

37:27.410 --> 37:28.399
HO, HO, HO.

37:31.880 --> 37:33.575
MONCRIEF JOHNSON,

37:33.610 --> 37:35.475
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR THE
MURDER OF THEODORE MELTREGGER

37:35.520 --> 37:36.839
AND THE ATTEMPTED MURDER
OF CARL WILCOX.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.344
I THINK YOU MADE
"THE NAUGHTY LIST."

37:45.090 --> 37:47.388
CONGRATULATIONS, SHAWN.

37:47.430 --> 37:48.852
WE GOT HIM.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.458
THANKS FOR BELIEVING ME
THIS TIME, MAN.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.660
THANKS
FOR SAVING MY DADDY.

37:57.340 --> 37:58.568
AH-AH-AH.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.879
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS.

38:02.910 --> 38:04.468
LET'S CLEAR THE AREA.

38:04.510 --> 38:07.399
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS CAN
COME WITH ME.

38:07.450 --> 38:09.008
HEY, MAN.

38:09.050 --> 38:10.472
[sighs]

38:10.520 --> 38:13.717
LOOK, I'M NOT A PARENT
OR AN UNCLE.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.684
OR EVEN A GODFATHER.

38:15.720 --> 38:17.654
I THINK CHILDREN
ARE STICKY.

38:17.690 --> 38:20.659
BUT LOOK, ONE THING'S
FOR CERTAIN,

38:20.690 --> 38:22.351
AND THAT'S THAT BRITTANY
IS A VERY SMART LITTLE GIRL.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.595
BUT SHE'S NOT GOING
TO BE LITTLE FOR LONG.

38:24.630 --> 38:27.064
WHEN THESE TIMES
ARE GONE, SHE'LL BE

38:27.100 --> 38:28.658
OUT THERE
MAKING HER OWN CHOICES.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.691
I MEAN, DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT YOU'RE TEACHING HER

38:30.740 --> 38:34.938
TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES?

38:34.980 --> 38:38.438
PLEASE DON'T,
I'M A GROWN MAN.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.869
SHE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.741
CARL.

38:49.690 --> 38:51.521
THANK YOU.

38:51.560 --> 38:54.552
[whispering]
OH, HERE
COMES YOUR DAD.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.989
DADDY.
COME ON,
COME ON, LET'S GO HOME.

39:04.040 --> 39:08.101
[knocking]

39:08.140 --> 39:10.870
[laughing]

39:12.850 --> 39:16.638
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

39:16.680 --> 39:17.669
I FEEL UH...

39:17.720 --> 39:19.711
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.
COME ON IN.

39:23.590 --> 39:25.421
[laughing]

39:31.430 --> 39:32.465
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

39:32.500 --> 39:33.819
WHEN I LEFT, YOU GUYS
WERE FURIOUS WITH EACH OTHER.

39:33.870 --> 39:35.167
WE STAYED THAT WAY
FOR A WHILE,

39:35.200 --> 39:36.292
BUT WE GOT OVER IT.

39:36.340 --> 39:39.605
(Mr. Guster)
LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.
YOU SEE...

39:39.640 --> 39:41.471
SEE, IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
THAT WE GOT MAD

39:41.510 --> 39:42.738
BECAUSE ONE OF US
DID SOMETHING STUPID.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.748
AND IT WON'T BE THE LAST.

39:44.780 --> 39:45.906
(Mrs. Guster)
OUR RULE IS,

39:45.950 --> 39:47.838
YOU CAN GET AS MAD
AS YOU LIKE,

39:47.880 --> 39:49.108
AS LONG AS YOU SPEND
THE SAME AMOUNT

39:49.150 --> 39:50.515
OF ENERGY WORKING IT
OUT AFTER.

39:50.550 --> 39:52.518
IT TOOK A LOT
OF ENERGY TO WORK OUT

39:52.550 --> 39:54.108
HOW WE FELT
ABOUT THE SECRET THE TWO

39:54.150 --> 39:56.653
OF YOU WERE KEEPING.

39:56.690 --> 39:57.657
BUT THEY GOT OVER IT.

39:57.690 --> 39:58.588
THEN WE REALIZED,

39:58.630 --> 40:00.586
YOU FRUSTRATED US THE WAY
ONLY FAMILY CAN,

40:00.630 --> 40:02.757
SO WE DECIDED
TO FORGIVE YOU TOO.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.789
THAN KS, MAN.

40:03.830 --> 40:05.559
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.667
OH, AND AS FAR
AS YOUR SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS,

40:10.700 --> 40:12.531
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO HOME.

40:12.570 --> 40:13.832
BUT YOU GOT
TO GET THE HELL UP OUT OF HERE.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.132
(Gus)
I HEAR THAT.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.432
BELIEVE THAT.
GOTCHA.

40:17.480 --> 40:18.674
MERRY CHRISTMAS, THOUGH.

40:18.710 --> 40:20.007
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

40:20.050 --> 40:21.779
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

40:21.820 --> 40:28.988
(all)
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

40:29.020 --> 40:32.080
HEY.
OH, HEY, HEY SHAWN.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.654
JUST CAME BY
TO DROP OFF YOUR GIFT.

40:33.690 --> 40:35.089
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR LODGE BUDDIES?

40:35.130 --> 40:37.928
OH, I MADE THE MISTAKE
OF TELLING SINGLETON

40:37.960 --> 40:39.518
HIS WIFE
WAS GETTING HIPPY.

40:39.570 --> 40:43.097
JUST A JOKE, I DIDN'T
MEAN ANYTHING BY IT.

40:43.140 --> 40:45.005
BUT TEMPERS STARTED TO FLARE,
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

40:45.040 --> 40:46.132
THE ROOM IS DIVIDED
INTO TWO CAMPS,

40:46.170 --> 40:47.205
"HIPPY" AND "NOT HIPPY."

40:47.240 --> 40:48.969
NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT
WAS TIME FOR ME

40:49.010 --> 40:50.773
TO SEND
EVERYBODY'S ASS HOME.

40:50.810 --> 40:51.799
WOW.

40:51.850 --> 40:54.102
I'M REALLY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT, POP.

40:54.150 --> 40:55.674
NO WORRIES.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.210
BECAUSE WE STILL
HAVE OUR TRADITION TO DO.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.138
RIGHT?

41:01.860 --> 41:04.158
AND MY WINNING STREAK
IS ABOUT TO BE EXTENDED.

41:11.770 --> 41:12.964
OH, MY.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.126
DID WE
GET EACH OTHER THE SAME--

41:14.170 --> 41:16.832
NO.

41:16.870 --> 41:18.804
YOU SEE, I FIGURED
YOU'D PULL A STUNT LIKE THIS.

41:18.840 --> 41:19.864
SO MINE IS JUST A DECOY.

41:19.910 --> 41:21.002
[gaSPSJ
OH.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.598
YOUR REAL PRESENT...

41:27.610 --> 41:29.009
YOU'RE SO PREDICTABLE.

41:29.050 --> 41:30.244
[snorts]

41:30.280 --> 41:33.249
WHICH IS WHY I
HID YOUR REAL PRESENT...

41:36.060 --> 41:38.187
NOW THIS IS JUST UNCANNY.

41:38.220 --> 41:39.778
YOU BETTER NOT HAVE
GOTTEN ME

41:39.830 --> 41:41.183
THE SAME IPHONE
I GOT YOU.

41:41.230 --> 41:41.924
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

41:41.960 --> 41:47.296
I GOT YOU THE
PSYCH IPHONE SKIN.

41:47.330 --> 41:51.061
BUT SILLY ME, YOU DON'T
HAVE AN IPHONE.

41:51.100 --> 41:53.807
SO I'LL JUST KEEP IT
FOR MY NEW ONE.

41:53.840 --> 41:56.308
AND MY WINNING STREAK
CONTINUES.

41:56.340 --> 41:59.173
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.089

*

42:08.190 --> 42:09.282

42:09.320 --> 42:11.959

42:11.990 --> 42:15.699

42:15.730 --> 42:17.049
