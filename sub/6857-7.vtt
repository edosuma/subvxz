00:15.688 --> 00:17.393
<i>Victory on Geonosis.</i>

00:17.643 --> 00:19.353
<i>After a massive planetary siege,</i>

00:19.680 --> 00:22.986
<i>the Separatist forces on Geonosis
have finally fallen.</i>

00:23.341 --> 00:25.865
<i>Key weapons factories
have been destroyed</i>

00:26.152 --> 00:28.422
<i>but at a heavy cost
to Republic troops.</i>

00:28.831 --> 00:31.466
<i>Now, as Jedi Master Luminara Unduli</i>

00:31.633 --> 00:34.953
<i>and Obi-Wan Kenobi
begin a cleanup of the planet,</i>

00:35.411 --> 00:37.103
<i>they launch an intense campaign</i>

00:37.270 --> 00:39.770
<i>to find separatist leader
Poggle the Lesser</i>

00:39.937 --> 00:42.328
<i>and bring him to justice.</i>

00:45.671 --> 00:47.472
Sorry to leave you here, Rex.

00:47.856 --> 00:49.424
There's still a lot to do.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.931
You two have done enough
destroying that factory.

00:52.098 --> 00:53.155
Go get some rest.

00:53.322 --> 00:55.431
We'll let General Kenobi
take it from here.

00:55.681 --> 00:57.592
We'll be back before you know it.

00:57.759 --> 00:59.109
We're ready, sir.

01:18.008 --> 01:19.353
A hard-won victory.

01:19.707 --> 01:20.557
Indeed.

01:20.724 --> 01:22.289
And a costly one.

01:22.456 --> 01:25.175
We suffer a great many losses
in these battles.

01:25.769 --> 01:26.696
Too many.

01:26.863 --> 01:30.132
The battles do appear to be coming
with growing frequency.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.990
No sign of Poggle, then?

01:32.565 --> 01:33.594
Nothing.

01:33.844 --> 01:37.540
We have clone squadrons spread out
all over the area but no hits yet.

01:37.842 --> 01:40.122
I'll go out and find some clue
as to where he went.

01:40.247 --> 01:42.986
- I'm sure the clones can handle...
- Poggle has too much information

01:43.111 --> 01:44.938
about the Separatists
to let him get away.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.732
Very well, Master Unduli.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.556
Just make sure to leave
a bit of strategic planning

01:49.681 --> 01:51.912
for me when I come back,
Master Kenobi.

01:52.037 --> 01:53.837
I'd hate to feel left out.

02:05.569 --> 02:06.668
We lost one.

02:10.137 --> 02:13.001
Lord Poggle says leave it.
We got to keep moving.

02:20.883 --> 02:21.912
What's this?

02:22.037 --> 02:24.102
I didn't expect
to find you up and about.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.173
After enough time in a bacta tank,

02:26.298 --> 02:29.841
one longs for the mundane comfort
of star charts.

02:30.193 --> 02:33.389
It seems like it did you some good.
Your wound looks almost healed.

02:33.683 --> 02:36.295
I wish I could say the same
for most of my men.

02:37.450 --> 02:40.569
Let's make sure we don't have
to take Geonosis a third time.

02:40.879 --> 02:43.728
Poggle's forces seem to have come
from the northern hemisphere.

02:44.153 --> 02:47.034
And where was
Master Unduli's last contact made from?

02:47.420 --> 02:49.349
This region farther to the west,

02:49.639 --> 02:52.378
but there's nothing out there according
to our latest intel.

02:54.924 --> 02:55.693
There.

02:55.885 --> 02:58.541
- Where?
- 150 klicks southeast.

03:01.737 --> 03:04.682
<i>It appears to be a munitions container
of some kind.</i>

03:05.098 --> 03:06.919
It could just be debris.

03:07.313 --> 03:10.332
I don't think so.
There was no battle in this area.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.640
It looks like Poggle was
on a direct course,

03:12.765 --> 03:14.663
11 mark 72, that way.

03:15.071 --> 03:17.489
Headed directly
for the Progate Temple.

03:17.658 --> 03:19.114
<i>That makes no sense.</i>

03:19.239 --> 03:21.488
<i>Nothing in the temple
could have survived the munitions</i>

03:21.613 --> 03:23.829
<i>we used in the first wave
of our attack.</i>

03:23.998 --> 03:26.123
<i>Why would he risk exposure
to go there?</i>

03:26.291 --> 03:27.549
I'm not yet sure.

03:27.674 --> 03:31.173
Perhaps he doesn't realize the extent
to which we cleared that area.

03:32.791 --> 03:35.257
I'm tracking a sandstorm
that's heading your way.

03:35.426 --> 03:37.613
<i>No matter.
Poggle is out in the open,</i>

03:37.738 --> 03:40.170
and I intend to grab him
before he can get offworld.

03:40.295 --> 03:41.720
I advise against it.

03:41.862 --> 03:43.849
You might get lost in the storm.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.383
<i>Then we'd have to find
both you and Poggle.</i>

03:46.724 --> 03:48.671
I feel it is a risk worth taking.

03:49.105 --> 03:50.217
<i>As you wish.</i>

03:51.345 --> 03:52.295
Let's go.

04:05.602 --> 04:08.167
O.M.5, are you still there?

04:09.294 --> 04:11.277
I think I'm right next to you.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.615
Where is Lord Poggle taking us?

04:21.220 --> 04:22.744
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.

04:25.007 --> 04:27.303
Don't leave me.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.317
I can't track Poggle in this storm.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.260
We'll reach the temple soon.

04:35.556 --> 04:37.486
We can get out of the storm there.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.459
What could be taking her so long?

04:52.849 --> 04:55.755
- Something must have happened.
- Patience, Skywalker.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.506
It's a delicate operation.

04:57.904 --> 05:00.383
I'm sure
we'll have more information soon.

05:02.278 --> 05:05.889
I must admit, I am troubled
that we've not heard from her.

05:06.057 --> 05:07.827
Let's not start worrying yet.

05:07.952 --> 05:11.132
Luminara's not one
to take unnecessary risks.

05:23.704 --> 05:26.195
You were right.
He's here somewhere.

05:45.934 --> 05:49.338
We tracked Poggle to the Progate Temple,
but now there's no sign of him.

05:49.684 --> 05:51.929
<i>Go no further
until we can send support.</i>

05:52.478 --> 05:53.812
<i>It's difficult with the storm</i>

05:53.980 --> 05:56.356
<i>We can barely read
your transmission as it is.</i>

06:06.242 --> 06:08.379
Are you sure
he went into the temple?

06:09.049 --> 06:12.747
<i>We saw him enter, but I think
he's gone down into the catacombs below.</i>

06:12.885 --> 06:16.084
Those catacombs go on for miles.
I fear we may have lost him.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.596
Get yourself out of there.

06:21.054 --> 06:22.689
We've lost the connection.

06:23.172 --> 06:24.426
Where are you going?

06:24.595 --> 06:27.270
- Take a guess.
- We'll never get to her in this storm.

06:27.395 --> 06:28.888
The gunships can't handle it.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.140
We can't wait.

06:30.308 --> 06:31.826
I'm sorry, Skywalker.

06:31.951 --> 06:33.559
We have no choice.

06:33.684 --> 06:36.316
We must be patient
and trust in Master Unduli.

06:36.731 --> 06:38.992
We'll leave as soon
as the storm lifts.

07:02.268 --> 07:03.589
Stay alert, everyone.

07:03.956 --> 07:05.733
Spread out and look around, men.

07:12.918 --> 07:13.974
Buzz is dead.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.392
- Any sign of Luminara?
- No, sir.

07:18.921 --> 07:20.471
There was a struggle.

07:26.188 --> 07:27.655
This is not a good sign.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.241
Luminara's lightsaber.

07:31.676 --> 07:33.276
Poggle didn't do this.

07:34.585 --> 07:36.035
But maybe that did.

07:36.878 --> 07:39.461
That is one ugly bug.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.666
I haven't seen one
that looks like that before.

07:43.791 --> 07:45.631
I don't believe anyone has.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.899
It could be the Geonosian queen.

07:48.245 --> 07:49.913
The bugs have a queen?

07:50.985 --> 07:51.985
Rumored.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.682
But we haven't found any proof
of her existence.

07:54.999 --> 07:55.999
Until now.

07:57.405 --> 07:58.405
This way.

07:59.115 --> 08:00.965
Come on, then.
Let's move.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.950
This leads to a dead end.

08:32.278 --> 08:33.971
This one goes down the furthest.

08:34.251 --> 08:36.822
- Sir, I'd say that's our best bet.
- I'll go first.

09:41.027 --> 09:42.227
Master Kenobi.

09:44.857 --> 09:48.087
<i>If you're following me,
you must leave this place. Just get out.</i>

09:48.351 --> 09:49.801
I repeat, fall ba...

09:52.898 --> 09:54.948
She must be close by.
Come on.

10:04.589 --> 10:06.438
I don't like the looks of this.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.490
Look out!

10:23.623 --> 10:25.023
I can't stop them.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.272
Back, everyone, back!

10:40.397 --> 10:42.734
Take out the tunnel supports.
It's the only way.

10:54.059 --> 10:56.624
What were those things?
We couldn't kill them.

10:56.749 --> 11:00.993
I've heard stories of a Geonosian
hive mind so powerful, so strong,

11:01.160 --> 11:03.913
that it can maintain
its connection with its warriors

11:04.197 --> 11:05.998
even after they have died.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.102
And you think
that's why we couldn't kill them,

11:08.227 --> 11:10.777
- because they're...
- Already dead, yes.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.537
That can't be true.
That's impossible.

11:13.662 --> 11:15.153
Impossible or not,

11:15.278 --> 11:19.288
these creatures keep moving
after we cut them up or shoot them down.

11:21.877 --> 11:23.577
Call for reinforcements.

11:28.952 --> 11:30.260
There's no signal.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.066
We must be too deep underground.

11:32.943 --> 11:33.734
You two,

11:33.902 --> 11:36.445
head back to the surface
and contact General Mundi.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.405
Tell him we need reinforcements.

11:41.219 --> 11:44.519
I won't be unhappy to get out
from under all this dirt.

11:45.578 --> 11:47.678
This place gives me the shivers.

11:54.786 --> 11:57.581
Wind's probably
playing tricks on us, right?

11:57.706 --> 11:58.806
Look around.

11:59.079 --> 12:00.429
There's nothing...

12:00.727 --> 12:01.727
What the?

12:02.597 --> 12:03.597
Blast 'em!

12:06.373 --> 12:09.373
- They're not going down!
- We have to turn back!

12:14.648 --> 12:15.648
Gearshift!

12:36.341 --> 12:39.175
Obviously the thing's
a lot more powerful than we assumed.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.991
I'm going to the surface
to alert General Mundi myself.

12:42.116 --> 12:44.430
I think that would be
a foolhardy move, Anakin.

12:44.941 --> 12:46.913
We can't divide our troops again.

12:47.038 --> 12:49.393
We don't have time
to double back to the surface.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.718
Every moment we waste
puts Luminara in greater danger.

13:26.446 --> 13:28.096
The air is warmer here.

13:28.418 --> 13:30.043
We must be getting close.

13:30.168 --> 13:31.668
Forget the heat.

13:32.817 --> 13:35.640
- It smells down here.
- Keep your voice down.

13:35.765 --> 13:39.532
I'm just saying, this planet is rotten
from the inside out.

13:46.046 --> 13:48.246
I've got a bad feeling about this.

13:48.724 --> 13:51.193
It must be the queen.

13:51.467 --> 13:52.790
Any sign of Luminara?

13:52.958 --> 13:55.417
I see her.
She's suspended near the throne.

13:55.691 --> 13:57.656
Perfect.
What about Poggle?

13:57.932 --> 14:00.024
He's speaking with the queen.

14:00.589 --> 14:04.468
Good. You take the soldiers,
I'll take the queen.

14:04.723 --> 14:06.873
Must you always rush into things?

14:08.565 --> 14:10.766
You don't actually want
to talk to it, do you?

14:10.934 --> 14:12.130
Matter of fact, I do.

14:12.255 --> 14:15.398
Anakin, don't you wonder
why they took Luminara captive?

14:15.523 --> 14:16.731
Why not just kill her?

14:16.898 --> 14:18.878
She's leverage. She's a hostage.

14:19.003 --> 14:20.191
Leverage for what?

14:20.316 --> 14:22.429
No, there's something else
going on here,

14:22.554 --> 14:24.440
and these zombies
are connected to it.

14:24.565 --> 14:26.465
Fine. We'll try it your way.

14:26.701 --> 14:28.101
So glad you agree.

14:28.226 --> 14:30.126
Set your men
up around the perimeter.

14:30.251 --> 14:31.819
These creatures live in darkness.

14:31.944 --> 14:34.628
The light from your helmet
should blind them temporarily.

14:34.753 --> 14:36.202
Turn your lamps on at my signal.

14:36.327 --> 14:39.253
They should create enough confusion
for us to get Luminara out of here.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.380
But what happens
when the bugs pursue?

14:41.505 --> 14:43.878
You've seen them in action, sir.
We can't kill them.

14:44.003 --> 14:46.552
We'll have to bury them.
It'll at least slow them down.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.935
Shoot out the support pillars
and this whole place will collapse.

14:50.060 --> 14:51.060
Let's go.

15:14.878 --> 15:17.728
How did you know
they wouldn't just attack us?

15:19.628 --> 15:23.428
Because I make observations
while you think with your lightsaber.

15:30.631 --> 15:32.665
That quick thinking of mine
is usually need

15:32.790 --> 15:34.752
when your observations
get us into trouble.

15:34.877 --> 15:36.878
Anakin,
the queen took Luminara hostage.

15:37.003 --> 15:39.553
She wanted a Jedi.
Now she has two more.

15:39.703 --> 15:41.440
I want to know what she's after.

15:44.921 --> 15:47.033
When this doesn't go as planned,
which it won't,

15:47.158 --> 15:48.358
I'll be ready.

15:48.754 --> 15:50.354
That is so reassuring.

15:53.798 --> 15:57.131
I thought I told you not to follow me,
Master Kenobi.

15:57.946 --> 16:01.951
I took a lesson from Anakin
and decided not to follow orders.

16:05.645 --> 16:07.411
You...

16:07.730 --> 16:09.375
are the creatures

16:09.500 --> 16:13.005
that attacked Geonosia.

16:13.598 --> 16:16.716
Why have you...

16:17.004 --> 16:20.349
come before me?

16:21.068 --> 16:24.403
Your Majesty,
it is a pleasure to finally meet you.

16:24.911 --> 16:27.961
I am Obi-Wan Kenobi,
and this is Anakin Skywalker.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.291
It is our sad duty to inform you
that your rule is at an end.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.643
You...

16:35.072 --> 16:35.973
not...

16:36.267 --> 16:38.677
dictate to me,

16:38.862 --> 16:40.307
Jedi.

16:40.808 --> 16:43.377
My Empire is...

16:43.874 --> 16:46.004
forever.

16:48.511 --> 16:51.316
I'm afraid it does not appear that way,
Your Grace.

16:51.441 --> 16:55.141
You shall release the Jedi Luminara
and submit to Republic law.

17:04.347 --> 17:05.732
I...

17:05.900 --> 17:07.901
no submit...

17:08.069 --> 17:09.953
to you!

17:12.342 --> 17:14.192
Patience, Anakin. Wait.

17:17.566 --> 17:18.566
Majesty,

17:18.997 --> 17:22.997
destroying us shall only make
the Republic's judgment of you harsher.

17:29.816 --> 17:33.385
I no destroy you.

17:34.149 --> 17:35.297
I...

17:35.733 --> 17:38.079
devour you.

17:38.969 --> 17:41.615
I control you.

17:42.342 --> 17:45.464
I had but one Jedi

17:45.589 --> 17:49.236
before young Poggle bring me.

17:50.252 --> 17:51.503
But now...

17:52.061 --> 17:55.608
I have three.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.328
Now, watch...

18:00.413 --> 18:02.042
as my child...

18:02.167 --> 18:06.119
enters your Jedi friend.

18:06.705 --> 18:09.329
And once inside,

18:09.783 --> 18:11.089
her mind...

18:12.336 --> 18:15.676
becomes my mind.

18:15.976 --> 18:17.621
Her thoughts,

18:18.115 --> 18:20.582
my thoughts.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.192
It's a sort of mind control,
a hive mind.

18:23.317 --> 18:25.216
- She thinks she can possess us.
- Great.

18:25.341 --> 18:28.670
- Find out all you wanted to know yet?
- No, wait. I want to see how it works.

18:28.795 --> 18:30.942
I don't think
Luminara wants to see how it works.

18:31.541 --> 18:32.641
No, I don't.

18:33.322 --> 18:35.322
I'm curious.
The more we know, the better.

18:37.254 --> 18:38.304
I disagree.

18:38.619 --> 18:39.567
So do I.

18:39.692 --> 18:43.442
Come now. The nose or the ear,
which do you think it will enter?

18:44.962 --> 18:46.041
I think the nose.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.860
I hope this is part of the plan.

18:49.564 --> 18:51.823
Isn't it always? Cody, now!

19:09.855 --> 19:11.855
You're coming with us, Poggle.

19:22.913 --> 19:24.313
Obi-Wan, look out!

19:27.714 --> 19:28.714
Got it.

19:29.253 --> 19:31.380
What are you doing?
I was going to study that.

19:31.505 --> 19:34.548
Study the bottom of my boot.
Come on. Let's get out of here.

19:34.716 --> 19:35.966
Here they come.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.198
Take out the supports!

20:05.329 --> 20:06.879
They're still coming!

20:18.407 --> 20:19.907
This is our way out.

20:21.783 --> 20:23.033
Start climbing.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.683
Obi-Wan, look out!

21:39.087 --> 21:40.787
All things considered...

21:41.539 --> 21:43.134
That went better than I expected.

21:43.318 --> 21:45.894
I wish we could have gotten
one of those worms.

21:46.019 --> 21:49.558
Knowing how the queen controls
her minions could have proven valuable.

21:50.495 --> 21:52.811
Hopefully the secret
is buried with her.
