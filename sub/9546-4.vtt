00:15.047 --> 00:17.844
All right, gentlemen here they are.
Get 'em while they're warm.

00:17.844 --> 00:19.465
Hey, Rusty, what's in these?

00:19.465 --> 00:21.205
In case my doctor needs to know.

00:21.205 --> 00:23.337
Let me tell you wise guys something.

00:23.337 --> 00:26.828
When I was on payroll,
we respected our elders.

00:26.828 --> 00:30.318
I come in here, I volunteer.
Do I get a "thank you, Rusty"?

00:30.318 --> 00:33.464
No, I get jokes.
And they aren't even funny jokes.

00:33.464 --> 00:34.822
They're old and stale.

00:34.822 --> 00:37.019
Come on, Rusty, we all love you.
You know that.

00:37.019 --> 00:38.384
Look, I'm eating one.

00:38.384 --> 00:40.745
Hey, hey, Karl with a K.

00:40.745 --> 00:42.492
Oh, hell, he's back.

00:42.492 --> 00:44.157
Hey, Chucky, you...

00:44.157 --> 00:45.912
You missed a spot.

00:46.138 --> 00:47.666
Captain...

00:47.909 --> 00:50.100
can you believe
it's been a year already?

00:50.100 --> 00:51.155
You know, Mr. Monk,

00:51.155 --> 00:54.219
I told you you can test those
smoke alarms at home by yourself.

00:54.219 --> 00:55.996
Yeah, I know, I know.

00:55.996 --> 00:59.861
But I'd rather you guys did it.
You're the experts, right?

01:02.853 --> 01:04.351
House fire, three alarm.

01:04.351 --> 01:06.774
Mr. Monk, I'm afraid you're gonna
have to wait. / Captain, I was here first.

01:06.774 --> 01:08.647
Sir, there's a house burning down
five blocks away.

01:08.647 --> 01:11.534
Don't you think that should
take priority right now?

01:11.925 --> 01:13.575
Don't you?

01:15.156 --> 01:16.732
Let's go.

01:17.131 --> 01:19.858
People, I don't have all day.

01:24.311 --> 01:26.673
- How many rooms do you have?
- Five.

01:26.673 --> 01:29.789
Thirty smoke detectors...
for five rooms?

01:29.789 --> 01:31.898
Plus two hallways and a vestibule.

01:31.898 --> 01:33.777
I used to say you can't
be too careful.

01:33.777 --> 01:35.853
Never say that again.

01:37.607 --> 01:40.433
Excuse me? Hello?

01:46.259 --> 01:48.989
Hey, you're not allowed back here.

01:52.761 --> 01:54.260
Rusty?

01:55.929 --> 01:57.451
Rusty?

01:59.865 --> 02:01.517
Hey... Russ...

02:19.595 --> 02:21.512
Hello?

02:23.254 --> 02:25.111
Mr. Monk?

02:26.391 --> 02:28.325
Oh, my God. Mr. Monk.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.742
Mr. Monk, are you okay?

02:31.287 --> 02:32.645
Is Rusty okay?

02:32.645 --> 02:34.403
Check on Rusty.

02:36.986 --> 02:39.088
I think he's dead.
What happened?

02:39.088 --> 02:41.092
I don't know.
There was a man.

02:41.092 --> 02:43.028
I tried to stop him.

02:43.028 --> 02:44.460
Mr. Monk, it's okay.
It's all over now.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.500
You can open your eyes.

02:47.788 --> 02:48.813
Oh, my God.

02:48.813 --> 02:51.965
Captain Stottlemeyer, please.
It's an emergency.

02:52.170 --> 02:54.290
Don't say anything.
Just sit over there, all right?

02:54.290 --> 02:57.062
- There's a chair right there.
- Where? Where?

02:57.062 --> 02:59.110
Right over there.

03:01.166 --> 03:02.847
Natalie...

03:02.978 --> 03:05.347
I can't see it.

03:10.881 --> 03:13.443

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON USA: 2006/07/28

04:21.452 --> 04:24.169
- So, how's it look, Doc?
- Well, okay.

04:24.169 --> 04:28.796
The liquid that hit him was a mixture
of detergent and muriatic acid.

04:28.796 --> 04:31.276
Both of his corneas
have been scarred.

04:31.276 --> 04:32.607
And there is nerve damage.

04:32.607 --> 04:34.963
- Which means what, exactly?
- It's hard to say.

04:34.963 --> 04:38.489
Sometimes the tissue
grows back by itself.

04:38.489 --> 04:40.544
And sometimes it doesn't.

04:40.768 --> 04:42.538
It's okay, Mr. Monk.

04:42.538 --> 04:43.814
He's afraid of the dark.

04:43.814 --> 04:46.230
Well, he might have
to get used to it.

04:46.230 --> 04:47.774
At least for a while.

04:47.774 --> 04:49.204
Excuse me.

04:49.204 --> 04:50.589
Monk?

04:50.589 --> 04:53.758
It's Randy.
I'm speaking to you.

04:53.953 --> 04:57.046
I'm standing right in front of you.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.901
Now I'm squatting.

05:02.901 --> 05:04.820
I'm about eye level.

05:04.820 --> 05:06.477
I just want you to know

05:06.477 --> 05:08.949
that we're gonna find the man
who did this to you.

05:08.949 --> 05:13.214
I'm gonna work on this case 24/7.

05:13.214 --> 05:15.601
I don't care how long it takes.

05:15.601 --> 05:17.517
Except for May 11th.

05:17.517 --> 05:20.531
My niece is getting confirmed,
and there's a reception the night before.

05:20.531 --> 05:21.975
So I'm probably gonna need...

05:21.975 --> 05:24.002
I'm probably gonna need
that whole weekend off.

05:24.002 --> 05:26.673
- So, Randy. Randy.
- From the 11th to the 13th.

05:26.673 --> 05:31.514
I didn't think this was possible,
but you're making this situation worse.

05:33.163 --> 05:35.692
Mr. Monk, you know
this is a top hospital.

05:35.692 --> 05:37.960
They're gonna do
everything they can.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.641
You can't give up.
There's always hope.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.679
There's never hope.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.715
This is something we do
at the school for the blind.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.157
It's called an empathy exercise.

05:50.157 --> 05:54.604
We use it to help families
and friends understand
what their loved one's going through.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.777
- How do you feel right now?
- I feel helpless and out of control.

05:57.777 --> 06:00.929
- Yeah, I feel disoriented.
- Even more than usual.

06:00.929 --> 06:04.284
This is how your friend Adrian's
feeling 24 hours a day.

06:04.284 --> 06:08.088
He has to relearn everything.
Even things he's done a thousand times.

06:08.088 --> 06:10.724
For example, you've spent
a lot of time here in the station.

06:10.724 --> 06:13.489
- You both probably know it pretty well.
- Sure.

06:13.489 --> 06:17.881
I want you to find the water cooler,
and pour yourself a cup of water.

06:18.061 --> 06:19.782
Piece of cake.

06:34.007 --> 06:36.279
Where's the cooler?

06:41.187 --> 06:42.686
Sorry, sorry.

06:42.686 --> 06:46.094
We're doing an empathy exercise.

06:53.181 --> 06:54.489
He's cheating.

06:54.489 --> 06:57.765
How does he know I'm cheating
unless he's cheating?

07:00.982 --> 07:04.837
- I won!
- Lieutenant, this isn't a competition.

07:05.086 --> 07:07.378
I know, but if it was a competition,

07:07.378 --> 07:09.783
I would've been the winner.

07:13.330 --> 07:15.037
There's a trick you can
teach your friend.

07:15.037 --> 07:18.578
If you stick your finger over the edge
of the cup, it won't overflow.

07:19.112 --> 07:20.816
Ms. Stein,

07:21.457 --> 07:23.095
you've never met Adrian Monk.

07:23.095 --> 07:24.892
He's not gonna be sticking
his fingers in any cups.

07:24.892 --> 07:26.495
He'd sooner die of thirst.

07:26.495 --> 07:30.369
The thing is, this guy is
really fragile to begin with.

07:30.369 --> 07:33.927
I just don't see how he's gonna
be able to function at all.

07:33.927 --> 07:36.519
Then it's up to you
to make him function.

07:36.519 --> 07:39.164
Get him back to work.
That's the best medicine.

07:39.164 --> 07:41.323
Back to work?

07:49.289 --> 07:51.985
Okay, which one is this?

07:51.985 --> 07:54.708
The one with the balloon.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.871
Oh, yeah.

07:56.871 --> 07:59.299
I love that one.

08:03.856 --> 08:06.769
- Is it straight?
- It's perfect.

08:06.769 --> 08:09.269
I'll never see her face again.

08:09.269 --> 08:12.272
Mr. Monk, don't say that.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.230
Am I crying?

08:14.230 --> 08:15.772
No.

08:16.581 --> 08:18.943
Feels like I'm crying.

08:20.447 --> 08:22.776
Feels like I'm crying all the time.

08:22.776 --> 08:24.906
Natalie, my life is over.

08:24.906 --> 08:26.999
Forget about me.

08:29.167 --> 08:31.846
You have to move on,
get another job.

08:31.846 --> 08:35.198
I am not going anywhere.
Look at me.

08:35.198 --> 08:36.434
Sorry.

08:36.434 --> 08:39.066
Your life is not over.
You could still do anything.

08:39.066 --> 08:43.254
There've been lots of blind people
who have done great and amazing things.

08:43.254 --> 08:46.227
- Like who?
- Like Ray Charles.

08:46.227 --> 08:51.243
- And, um... you know.
- Yeah?

08:51.243 --> 08:53.960
You know, uh,
I mean, come on.

09:00.076 --> 09:01.762
Mr. Magoo.

09:01.762 --> 09:03.938
- Who's that?
- Mr. Magoo?

09:03.938 --> 09:06.840
Oh, gosh, he was a great man.

09:06.840 --> 09:10.316
- Um... an inventor.
- Really?

09:10.316 --> 09:11.864
An entrepreneur, if you will.

09:11.864 --> 09:15.011
He did lots of amazing,
amazing things.

09:15.011 --> 09:16.266
And he was blind?

09:16.266 --> 09:17.931
I don't want to talk
about Mr. Magoo anymore.

09:17.931 --> 09:19.701
- Me neither.
- Hello?

09:19.701 --> 09:21.523
- Door was open.
- Cap?

09:21.523 --> 09:24.380
Hey, how's it going?

09:24.380 --> 09:27.075
Uh, well, gosh, he's doing great.

09:27.075 --> 09:28.600
He's just great.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.409
I'm so proud of him.

09:30.409 --> 09:32.470
Good. Good.

09:32.470 --> 09:34.255
Uh, listen, Monk.

09:34.255 --> 09:36.796
I'm on my way over to the firehouse.
I want you to come along.

09:36.796 --> 09:39.502
What for?
I gave the lieutenant my statement.

09:39.502 --> 09:41.885
Yeah, I know.
I just, uh...

09:41.885 --> 09:45.112
I thought that maybe you might
see something.

09:45.112 --> 09:47.909
- Somehow I doubt that.
- You know what I mean.

09:47.909 --> 09:53.225
Look, Monk, even in this condition,
you're still the best detective I know.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.173
Exactly. I think it's a great idea.

09:55.173 --> 09:58.393
You don't mean that.
You're just trying to cheer me up.

09:58.393 --> 10:01.114
Look, Monk, this isn't only about you.

10:01.114 --> 10:03.026
This is a homicide investigation.

10:03.026 --> 10:04.901
A fireman was killed.

10:04.901 --> 10:06.280
- Rusty.
- Rusty.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.566
He was a stand-up guy.
He'd been on that engine for 35 years,

10:09.566 --> 10:11.412
and I'm gonna nail
the son of a bitch that killed him.

10:11.412 --> 10:13.610
- And you're gonna help me.
- Leland, I can't.

10:13.610 --> 10:17.613
- I ca... I can't...
- Monk, I'm not asking you.

10:17.613 --> 10:20.042
Natalie, get him up.

10:20.042 --> 10:23.582
- Come on, you heard the captain.
- Okay, I'm coming. But listen,

10:23.582 --> 10:26.591
don't expect too much from me.
I'm no Mr. Magoo.

10:26.591 --> 10:29.286
- Let's go.
- Mr. Magoo?

10:29.286 --> 10:32.452
You know, Magoo...
the famous inventor.

10:33.449 --> 10:35.080
Magoo.

10:56.205 --> 10:57.951
Now...

10:58.921 --> 11:01.801
the table is here.

11:02.541 --> 11:04.383
No, Monk.

11:05.450 --> 11:08.964
The table is here.

11:09.484 --> 11:13.282
All right.
That puts the pole right there.

11:14.932 --> 11:16.468
- The pole's there.
- I can't do this.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.401
You can do this.
You can do this.

11:18.401 --> 11:20.055
Mr. Monk, just concentrate, okay?

11:20.055 --> 11:22.138
All right, just try to picture the room.

11:22.138 --> 11:24.552
You can do this.
You have an amazing memory.

11:24.552 --> 11:27.520
Oh, right.
I forgot about my amazing memory.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.262
Look, what we can't figure is
what the guy was doing here.

11:31.262 --> 11:33.582
What was he looking for?

11:33.582 --> 11:35.844
- Is anything missing?
- I don't think so.

11:35.844 --> 11:38.789
There's nothing here worth taking.
No money. Nothing.

11:38.789 --> 11:40.587
It just doesn't make any sense.

11:40.587 --> 11:42.580
Okay, let's do this.

11:42.580 --> 11:44.016
Have a seat.

11:48.346 --> 11:50.378
You and Rusty were sitting here.

11:50.378 --> 11:52.622
You were checking
the smoke detectors.

11:52.622 --> 11:54.218
Right. Right.

11:54.218 --> 11:58.947
And then this man entered
from over there.

11:58.947 --> 12:01.059
And he walked
around the truck slowly,

12:01.059 --> 12:03.208
like he was trying
not to be noticed.

12:03.208 --> 12:05.857
Monk, Lieutenant Randy Disher.
I'm speaking to you again.

12:05.857 --> 12:09.769
Randy, you don't need to tell the man
that you're speaking to him.

12:09.769 --> 12:10.818
Yes, sir.

12:10.818 --> 12:14.539
Okay, you know who this is,
and you know I'm speaking to you.

12:14.539 --> 12:17.070
Now, in your statement,
you said that you could hear him.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.670
- That his shoes were squeaking.
- That's right.

12:18.670 --> 12:20.924
That he was tall, maybe 6'1".

12:20.924 --> 12:23.845
Heavyset, with sandy hair,
wearing a leather jacket.

12:23.845 --> 12:26.577
Right. That's right.
And then Rusty...

12:26.577 --> 12:31.395
Rusty walked over to him,
around the back of the truck.

12:31.395 --> 12:33.582
Then I heard this big noise.

12:33.582 --> 12:36.797
Then I walked around the truck.

12:39.384 --> 12:43.669
I went around the back of the truck.

12:43.669 --> 12:44.980
Where...
Where's the truck?

12:44.980 --> 12:46.819
The truck's been moved, Monk.
You're good.

12:46.819 --> 12:50.150
And then...
Then I saw Rusty on the floor.

12:50.150 --> 12:52.846
And the guy was
holding a shovel in his hands.

12:52.846 --> 12:54.897
You said you could smell him.
He'd been drinking.

12:54.897 --> 12:57.432
Rum.
He smelled like rum.

12:57.432 --> 12:58.850
We got that, Randy.

12:58.850 --> 13:00.903
Is there anything else?
Anything new?

13:00.903 --> 13:03.510
- Anything you forgot to mention?
- No, no.

13:03.510 --> 13:08.249
He grabbed the container,
and he just threw the solvent in my eyes.

13:08.249 --> 13:10.720
That was the last thing I saw.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.818
Oh, my God.

13:12.818 --> 13:14.554
That was the last thing I saw.

13:14.554 --> 13:18.208
Oh, what is that?
What is it?

13:19.306 --> 13:22.150
- Is it off?
- It's off.

13:22.150 --> 13:24.492
- Can I go home now?
- Yes, you can go home now.

13:24.492 --> 13:26.430
Hold on, hold on.
Here.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.514
Ok, step, step, step.

13:28.514 --> 13:30.301
Here, here.
Yes, yes.

13:30.301 --> 13:32.222
It's okay, I gotcha.
I gotcha.

13:35.893 --> 13:37.736
You're okay.

13:38.976 --> 13:40.613
Wait.
Wait a second.

13:40.613 --> 13:42.347
What?

13:43.491 --> 13:45.897
Wait a minute.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.476
What is it?

13:52.454 --> 13:56.320
There's a coat missing here.

13:56.320 --> 14:01.795
A coat? / There were six coats
hanging right here.

14:01.795 --> 14:03.569
He's right.

14:03.914 --> 14:05.223
There's one missing.

14:05.223 --> 14:07.348
He came in to steal a coat?
He's willing to kill for it?

14:07.348 --> 14:09.345
It doesn't make any sense
to me either, but it's something.

14:09.345 --> 14:12.498
We find that coat, we find a guy.

14:13.203 --> 14:15.582
See, you're amazing.

14:15.582 --> 14:17.750
Hey. High-five.

14:18.866 --> 14:21.013
All right.
Good work.

14:24.566 --> 14:27.018
Good, good, good.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.239
All right, very...

14:30.239 --> 14:31.633
Okay, see?
There you go.

14:31.633 --> 14:33.517
You don't need me at all.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.431
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I didn't see it.

14:39.623 --> 14:42.477
- Join the club.
- Hey, how's he doing?

14:43.043 --> 14:44.997
We just got back from the hospital.

14:44.997 --> 14:47.403
They're very optimistic.

14:47.403 --> 14:49.158
You mean pessimistic.

14:49.158 --> 14:53.089
No, they're very optimistic.

14:53.089 --> 14:55.800
Well, then, why are you
shaking your head?

14:57.652 --> 14:59.932
- So what's so important, Randy?
- I think we got him.

14:59.932 --> 15:03.088
We just picked up a guy in Rockaway,
and he was wearing the fireman's coat.

15:03.088 --> 15:05.485
- He's in the bullpen.
- Who is he?

15:05.485 --> 15:08.278
A guy named Kolbert.
Jake Kolbert.

15:08.278 --> 15:10.142
He's a drifter.
He lives out by the beach.

15:10.142 --> 15:13.167
- You think you can I.D. him?
- Oh, I don't know how.

15:13.167 --> 15:15.227
Maybe you haven't heard.

15:15.227 --> 15:16.737
I am blind.

15:16.737 --> 15:20.159
But you'll do the best you can.
Right?

15:20.159 --> 15:22.609
You're not gonna give up just because
you've been dealt a bad hand.

15:22.609 --> 15:24.450
Have I been dealt a bad hand?
I wouldn't know,

15:24.450 --> 15:25.971
because I'm blind!

15:25.971 --> 15:28.865
Monk. Hey, I like the cane.

15:28.865 --> 15:30.847
- You look kind of dapper.
- You say you found the guy?

15:30.847 --> 15:33.034
We found a guy.
He's the right height.

15:33.034 --> 15:35.598
He doesn't have an alibi,
and he was wearing the missing coat.

15:35.598 --> 15:37.384
- Did his shoes squeak?
- Don't know.

15:37.384 --> 15:38.986
He was barefoot
when we picked him up.

15:38.986 --> 15:40.755
But that doesn't matter,
because we don't need shoes.

15:40.755 --> 15:44.331
- Because I've got and eyewitness.
- So to speak.

15:50.084 --> 15:53.862
Jake Kolbert, this is Adrian Monk.

15:55.811 --> 15:57.279
We're here to figure out

15:57.279 --> 16:01.415
if you two met at fire company 53
last Sunday.

16:01.415 --> 16:02.607
No.

16:02.607 --> 16:04.541
I've never seen him before in my life.

16:04.541 --> 16:07.001
I told you, man,
I found that coat in a dumpster.

16:07.001 --> 16:10.146
Behind a restaurant on Vinton Street.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.138
He the guy?

16:16.344 --> 16:18.058
I can't tell.

16:19.192 --> 16:22.643
The guy at the firehouse
never said a word.

16:22.643 --> 16:24.365
Okay.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.466
Well, you know what we have to do.

16:26.466 --> 16:28.181
We have to feel the man's face.

16:28.181 --> 16:30.990
What? No.
No, Leland. Please.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.504
I can't. God, I can't.

16:32.504 --> 16:34.645
You're the only witness I got.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.578
- He's a drifter.
- So what?

16:36.578 --> 16:40.984
I have lived my whole life
without feeling a drifter's face.

16:40.984 --> 16:42.386
I've always been
very proud of that.

16:42.386 --> 16:44.403
Even on my worst day,

16:44.403 --> 16:46.831
I could tell myself

16:46.831 --> 16:50.432
at least I didn't feel a drifter's face.

16:50.432 --> 16:53.393
This could be the man
who killed Rusty and blinded you.

16:53.393 --> 16:56.819
I am not letting him or you
walk out of here until I'm sure.

16:56.819 --> 16:58.417
Oh, God. / Come on.

16:58.678 --> 16:59.881
God.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.575
No.

17:37.061 --> 17:39.300
That's a wart.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.241
Oh, God.
Wipe!

17:40.241 --> 17:41.314
- Wipe! Wipe!
- Yes. Yes.

17:41.314 --> 17:42.693
Wipe!

17:42.877 --> 17:45.040
Right here, right here,
right here.

17:49.315 --> 17:52.031
- He's not the guy.
- I've been trying to tell you.

17:52.031 --> 17:54.095
I found that coat in a dumpster.

17:54.095 --> 17:57.242
I get cold at night.
I sleep in a cardboard box at the beach.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.340
My life sucks!

17:58.340 --> 18:01.720
What are you complaining about?
At least you can see.

18:01.720 --> 18:04.310
Oh, I got plenty to complain about.
Don't get me started.

18:04.310 --> 18:07.127
I've got a nine-year-old dog
that needs a new kidney.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.910
I had a bucket of acid
thrown in my face.

18:09.910 --> 18:11.180
I think I win.

18:11.180 --> 18:13.541
I haven't had a hot meal in three years.

18:13.541 --> 18:15.273
My wife is dead.

18:15.273 --> 18:16.575
So is mine.

18:16.575 --> 18:19.836
- Car bomb?
- Pneumonia.

18:20.344 --> 18:23.293
- Natalie, car bomb or pneumonia?
- Mr. Monk, I don't know.

18:23.293 --> 18:26.169
Yeah, I bet your wife didn't suffer.

18:26.169 --> 18:31.748
Trudy lived for 20 minutes
in pain, alone.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.414
Y... You're an amateur.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.503
Come back when you got something.

18:36.503 --> 18:38.275
Who's next?

18:38.461 --> 18:39.944
Come on. Anybody.

18:39.944 --> 18:42.876
You're looking at the most
miserable man on Earth.

18:42.876 --> 18:44.167
Oh, hey, you.
How 'bout you?

18:44.167 --> 18:45.617
How 'bout you?
You want a piece of me?

18:45.617 --> 18:48.334
I'll take you all on
at the same time.

18:48.757 --> 18:50.843
I can't lose!

18:51.430 --> 18:54.694
I... I can't lose.

19:07.423 --> 19:09.934
This is Adrian... Monk.

19:09.934 --> 19:12.694
Thank you for calling
my new answering machine.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.199
When you hear the beep noise

19:14.199 --> 19:16.876
please speak
into the telephone receiver,

19:16.876 --> 19:20.175
and leave a message which
I will play back and listen to later.

19:20.175 --> 19:22.633
This is the end of the message.

19:22.633 --> 19:25.879
And here is the beep
I was talking about.

19:27.180 --> 19:29.574
Adrian, it's Dr. Kroger again.

19:29.574 --> 19:32.567
Now, I know you're there,
so please pick up.

19:33.241 --> 19:38.362
Adrian, you missed your 10:30,
and your 3:30.

19:38.362 --> 19:40.874
Adrian, you can't
stay in your house forever.

19:40.874 --> 19:42.100
Wanna bet?

19:42.100 --> 19:43.273
I know you, Adrian.

19:43.273 --> 19:47.633
You're probably lying on your bed
feeling sorry for yourself.

19:47.633 --> 19:48.814
You can't just give up.

19:48.814 --> 19:51.353
There are people out there
who really need you.

19:51.353 --> 19:53.504
Come on, Adrian.

19:53.870 --> 19:55.722
You have to get up.
Get out of bed.

19:55.722 --> 19:57.332
Come on, you can do it.
Here we go.

19:57.332 --> 19:59.315
That's right, come on.
Come on.

19:59.315 --> 20:01.252
Up and at 'em.
Okay, go on.

20:01.252 --> 20:02.543
Come on, come...

20:02.794 --> 20:05.093
This must be it.

20:05.093 --> 20:06.638
Describe it.

20:06.638 --> 20:11.622
Oh, you know, Monk, it's tenderloin.
Right in the heart of wino land.

20:11.622 --> 20:13.867
We're standing in an alley behind a bar,

20:13.867 --> 20:16.032
in front of a standard-issue dumpster.

20:16.032 --> 20:18.161
Probably about three cubic yards.

20:18.161 --> 20:20.529
It is filled with garbage.

20:20.529 --> 20:23.415
Broken bottles, cardboard boxes.

20:23.415 --> 20:27.259
Monk, Randy Disher speaking.
I'm opening my notebook.

20:27.649 --> 20:29.306
Hold on. I can't find my...

20:29.306 --> 20:31.347
- I can't find my notebook.
- Yeah.

20:31.565 --> 20:34.559
I'm checking my pockets.
Patting my pockets.

20:34.559 --> 20:37.258
Oh... found the notebook.

20:37.422 --> 20:39.169
Opening notebook.

20:40.468 --> 20:42.171
Yeah, according to Mr. Kolbert,

20:42.171 --> 20:45.892
he was here 5:00 PM last Sunday,
collecting bottles.

20:45.892 --> 20:48.041
He found the fireman's coat
in the dumpster.

20:48.041 --> 20:52.845
5:00. That's just three hours
after Rusty was killed.

20:52.845 --> 20:55.245
He also said he found
a fireman's helmet,

20:55.245 --> 20:56.451
which he gave to a couple of kids.

20:56.451 --> 21:00.037
He kills a man for a fireman's coat.

21:00.037 --> 21:02.717
He throws it away
a couple hours later.

21:02.717 --> 21:05.209
That makes no sense.

21:07.026 --> 21:10.683
Ooh, God.
I'm glad I didn't see that.

21:11.075 --> 21:13.258
- Natalie.
- What?

21:13.732 --> 21:17.753
- Natalie, I'm glad I didn't see that.
- Yeah.

21:17.753 --> 21:20.720
This is... It's an alley, right?
It must be pretty filthy.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.422
- Yeah, It's disgusting.
- I'd probably hate this place.

21:23.422 --> 21:25.109
Oh, Mr. Monk,
you wouldn't last five minutes here.

21:25.109 --> 21:27.641
- There's cockroaches...
- There's a dead cat right over there.

21:27.641 --> 21:33.103
Natalie, it doesn't bother me.
Nothing bothers me.

21:33.699 --> 21:35.373
It's great.

21:35.373 --> 21:36.892
I can't see anything.

21:36.892 --> 21:38.551
I don't see any of it.

21:38.551 --> 21:41.186
This could really work for me.

21:41.186 --> 21:42.598
I hate this neighborhood.

21:42.598 --> 21:44.765
I was stuck here
for three hours Sunday.

21:44.765 --> 21:46.739
The house that burned down
was just around the corner.

21:46.739 --> 21:47.807
Hold on. Hold on.

21:47.807 --> 21:52.153
The fire on Sunday was... was...
was right here in this very neighborhood?

21:52.153 --> 21:54.363
Yeah. The woman was killed.

21:54.363 --> 21:57.473
She fell asleep smoking a cigarette
in front of the TV.

21:57.473 --> 21:58.681
I don't think so.

21:58.681 --> 22:05.563
No, no. There has to be a connection
between that fire and what happened to Rusty.

22:05.563 --> 22:07.923
Okay, let's go.
Come on, people.

22:07.923 --> 22:09.977
Come on.
We got a case to solve.

22:09.977 --> 22:11.864
Wait. Dead cat on your left.

22:30.374 --> 22:32.092
Monk, do you want some gloves?

22:32.092 --> 22:33.397
Don't need 'em.

22:33.397 --> 22:36.127
Out of sight, out of mind.

22:38.717 --> 22:41.001
Excuse me.
Blind man walking.

22:41.001 --> 22:42.579
Excuse me.

22:45.745 --> 22:47.577
- Is this the living room?
- That's right.

22:47.577 --> 22:50.797
- She was on the couch.
- Which is on your right.

22:52.175 --> 22:53.426
Easy.

22:53.426 --> 22:55.647
Yeah, she was on the couch,
she was watching TV.

22:55.647 --> 22:57.896
She's smoking. She's drinking.
She falls asleep.

22:57.896 --> 23:01.662
Cigarette falls on a pile of newspapers,
and whoosh.

23:01.662 --> 23:04.628
At least, that's the official version.

23:09.610 --> 23:12.252
Rum. Rum.

23:12.653 --> 23:14.286
Who was she?

23:14.286 --> 23:17.037
Disher opening file.

23:17.341 --> 23:19.469
"Stefanie Preston. 27."

23:19.469 --> 23:23.999
She was a temp.
"Last job, Peter Breen Construction."

23:23.999 --> 23:25.965
Lived here alone.

23:25.965 --> 23:28.970
Well, I don't think she lived here alone.

23:29.307 --> 23:30.765
At least not every night.

23:30.765 --> 23:33.451
There's a bottle of men's cologne
in the bathroom.

23:33.451 --> 23:35.539
Two toothbrushes.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.797
Two different types of toothpaste.

23:37.797 --> 23:39.366
She's got a boyfriend.

23:39.366 --> 23:41.380
Oh, there was...

23:41.380 --> 23:44.223
There was something here.

23:44.223 --> 23:49.671
Something etched in the glass.
The shape of an animal.

23:49.671 --> 23:52.465
A donkey or a horse.

23:53.321 --> 23:55.825
It looks like a horse.

23:56.613 --> 23:58.303
Wh... Wh... What's this?

23:58.303 --> 24:00.649
TV remote.

24:02.089 --> 24:04.042
At least it was.

24:04.042 --> 24:09.509
Okay, if she was watching TV
from over there,

24:09.509 --> 24:13.122
why is the remote way over here?

24:13.122 --> 24:15.083
I don't know.

24:18.673 --> 24:20.874
I think I do.

24:21.165 --> 24:25.427
Captain, here's what happened.

24:26.653 --> 24:29.148
Somebody killed her.

24:29.148 --> 24:34.473
Probably strangled her, then made it
look like she fell asleep on the couch.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.442
He probably walked away.

24:36.442 --> 24:39.432
Then he stopped and realized
he forgot something.

24:39.432 --> 24:42.021
Something inside the house.

24:42.021 --> 24:44.235
- What was it?
- I don't know.

24:44.235 --> 24:46.267
Probably metal.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.398
Something that would
survive the fire.

24:48.398 --> 24:50.039
Something that could
be traced back to him.

24:50.039 --> 24:51.926
Whatever it was,
he had to get it back.

24:51.926 --> 24:53.228
But how?

24:53.228 --> 24:56.444
The house was on fire.
The trucks were already here.

24:56.444 --> 24:59.822
- The place was surrounded.
- He needed a fireman's coat.

24:59.822 --> 25:02.840
Exactly. That's what he was doing
in the firehouse.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.963
That... That's why
he stole the coat.

25:06.148 --> 25:09.377
He came back here.
He looked like one of the guys.

25:09.377 --> 25:11.982
Nobody noticed him.
Nobody questioned him.

25:11.982 --> 25:16.480
He walked right past them,
came inside...

25:16.480 --> 25:19.888
Grabbed whatever it was
he left behind.

25:19.888 --> 25:22.119
Not bad for a blind guy.

25:22.119 --> 25:24.203
I'm back, baby.

25:24.203 --> 25:27.059
Mr. Monk, you're talking to a doorjamb.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.139
I'm back!

25:33.323 --> 25:36.088
You know, Adrian. I...
I just don't know what to say.

25:36.088 --> 25:39.270
After you got the diagnosis,
you were so despondent.

25:39.270 --> 25:40.828
- Was I?
- Yes.

25:40.828 --> 25:43.562
You were catatonic.
You were sitting here sobbing,

25:43.562 --> 25:47.468
because you thought you'd never be
able to look at Trudy's photos again.

25:47.468 --> 25:49.824
All I know is I've never been happier.

25:49.824 --> 25:52.268
I am at peace.
Dig this...

25:52.268 --> 25:53.426
Dig this?

25:53.426 --> 25:56.793
Yesterday the school for the blind
sent over a woman to teach me

25:56.793 --> 25:58.293
how to get around.

25:58.293 --> 26:03.016
She wanted me to count the steps
from my front door to the street.

26:03.016 --> 26:04.350
I said, "Sweetheart,

26:04.350 --> 26:08.392
"I've been counting those steps
for five years. 44."

26:08.392 --> 26:09.748
So you see,

26:09.748 --> 26:14.491
I have been preparing to be blind
my whole life.

26:14.491 --> 26:17.368
All right, Adrian,
wh... what about your work?

26:17.368 --> 26:19.041
My work?
My work's great.

26:19.041 --> 26:23.412
I'd say I'm operating at
or just below Magoo level.

26:23.412 --> 26:25.763
Adrian, I have to tell you
I'm a little concerned.

26:25.763 --> 26:28.202
Now, there are five stages of grief,

26:28.202 --> 26:32.134
and I think you've already leapfrog
over at least the first three of them.

26:32.134 --> 26:34.479
- And I think any doctor...
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

26:34.479 --> 26:36.606
I was just thinking...

26:36.606 --> 26:39.096
You could be naked right now,

26:39.096 --> 26:41.541
and it wouldn't bother me.

26:41.541 --> 26:43.723
- Adrian, I'm not naked.
- But you could be.

26:43.723 --> 26:44.904
Look it, Adrian.

26:44.904 --> 26:49.813
I think that you're using this condition
as an excuse to cut yourself off

26:49.813 --> 26:52.089
from the real world,
even more than usual.

26:52.089 --> 26:54.388
And the pendulum will swing back.

26:54.388 --> 26:56.444
- I don't think so.
- Yes, it will.

26:56.444 --> 26:58.646
This is what pendulums do.

26:58.646 --> 27:01.984
You could come crashing down.
It would be very painful.

27:01.984 --> 27:04.483
I... I... I just refuse to believe
that you are happy...

27:04.483 --> 27:09.061
genuinely happy...
having lost your eyesight.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.177
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

27:11.177 --> 27:12.656
Oh, okay, fine.

27:12.656 --> 27:15.888
Well, then, why don't we get some
ear plugs, and some nose plugs?

27:15.888 --> 27:19.559
And then you can just cut yourself off
completely from the world.

27:19.559 --> 27:22.244
Or maybe

27:22.244 --> 27:26.252
we could arrange
to have you put into a coma.

27:26.252 --> 27:29.543
Well, let's try the ear plug thing first.

27:34.652 --> 27:36.446
- Stefanie what?
- Preston.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.402
She worked in your office
until last week?

27:38.402 --> 27:40.379
I remember her.
Stefanie... nice kid.

27:40.379 --> 27:41.789
Hey, you mind if we walk
while we talk?

27:41.789 --> 27:44.423
Time is money, and frankly,
I don't have enough of either.

27:44.423 --> 27:47.588
Hey, Mr. Monk, you might want to wait
in the trailer.

27:47.588 --> 27:50.200
It's probably a lot safer for you.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.804
Ground's a little rough out here.

27:51.804 --> 27:54.115
No, no, don't, uh...
Don't worry about me.

27:54.115 --> 27:57.333
I just want to be treated
like everybody else.

27:58.396 --> 28:01.406
Make sure the electrical inspector
gets a copy, all right?

28:01.406 --> 28:03.371
So, what can you tell us about her?

28:03.371 --> 28:05.048
Uh, not much.
She was a temp.

28:05.048 --> 28:06.397
She was here for maybe eight weeks.

28:06.397 --> 28:08.297
My regular girl was away
on maternity leave.

28:08.297 --> 28:10.711
- You said there was fire?
- That's right.

28:10.711 --> 28:12.261
That's terrible.
That's heartbreaking.

28:12.261 --> 28:16.233
Mr. Breen, how well
did you know her?

28:16.459 --> 28:19.374
Well, I didn't really know her at all.

28:20.698 --> 28:22.084
Oh, my gosh.

28:23.989 --> 28:26.452
- What is wrong with you?
- What? There's barbed wire.

28:26.452 --> 28:29.399
- You're gonna cut yourself.
- I'm not going to cut myself.

28:29.399 --> 28:30.677
I have a radar.

28:30.677 --> 28:32.162
- A radar?
- Yes.

28:32.162 --> 28:35.506
I feel it now.
It's like a sixth sense.

28:35.506 --> 28:38.150
I'm like a bat in a cave.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.566
You know, they swoop around,
but they never hit the walls.

28:40.566 --> 28:42.898
Well, I don't think
your radar is working.

28:42.898 --> 28:46.231
It... It's wor...
Listen to me.

28:46.928 --> 28:50.735
It's working fine, okay?
I am a swooping bat.

28:50.735 --> 28:53.506
My antennae are tingling all the time.

28:53.506 --> 28:55.363
Hey, swooping bat guy.

28:55.363 --> 28:57.251
I'm over here.

29:01.359 --> 29:03.160
Stay with the group.

29:03.325 --> 29:05.714
Have you ever been
to Stefanie Preston's house?

29:05.714 --> 29:07.199
Why would I go to her house?

29:07.199 --> 29:08.911
She was a very attractive woman.

29:08.911 --> 29:10.717
Yeah, and so is my wife.

29:10.717 --> 29:12.211
Is that your Ferrari out there?

29:12.211 --> 29:14.042
- That's one of them.
- Do you like it?

29:14.042 --> 29:15.401
I was thinking about
getting one myself.

29:15.401 --> 29:18.680
It's either between that
or the Ford Festiva.

29:19.775 --> 29:21.768
Where were you Sunday afternoon?

29:21.768 --> 29:24.254
Uh, Sunday I was here, on site,

29:24.254 --> 29:26.906
meeting with the architect
and construction manager.

29:26.906 --> 29:28.698
Hey, boss, I got that work order.

29:28.698 --> 29:30.358
Oh, and I still have those keys.

29:30.358 --> 29:31.779
Uh, Eddie, we're a little busy right now.

29:31.779 --> 29:33.503
You know what?
We'll take care of that later.

29:33.503 --> 29:35.071
Gentlemen?

29:38.981 --> 29:41.138
Capt Captain.

29:41.138 --> 29:42.699
Captain, listen to that.

29:42.699 --> 29:45.252
Sqaky shoes.
That's the guy.

29:45.252 --> 29:46.750
Come on.

30:02.989 --> 30:04.495
Mr. Monk?

30:31.480 --> 30:34.280
This way.
Definitely this way.

30:56.105 --> 30:58.000
Can I help you?

31:09.683 --> 31:12.016
It's the guy, Captain.

31:14.165 --> 31:16.373
Cap... Captain?

31:17.468 --> 31:19.367
You're under arrest.

31:19.367 --> 31:21.780
You have the right to remain silent.

31:21.780 --> 31:24.524
Though I'd prefer it if you didn't.

31:25.656 --> 31:26.897
Captain?

31:27.493 --> 31:29.223
Captain!

32:07.284 --> 32:09.271
Help! Somebody!

33:10.881 --> 33:13.691
Elevator out of order

34:02.096 --> 34:03.560
My...

34:05.209 --> 34:06.828
God.

34:07.966 --> 34:09.161
Help!

34:10.277 --> 34:11.454
Help! Help!

34:11.454 --> 34:13.199
Somebody!

34:13.638 --> 34:15.905
Help me, here!

34:16.693 --> 34:18.050
Help!

34:18.500 --> 34:19.750
Help!

34:19.750 --> 34:21.915
Heads up!

34:27.925 --> 34:30.751
I can't breathe, the air's so thin.

34:38.043 --> 34:39.774
- Mr. Monk?
- Help me!

34:39.774 --> 34:41.609
Mr. Monk, what are you doing?

34:44.348 --> 34:46.237
- Natalie.
- Yes?

34:46.561 --> 34:49.322
Are you... flying?

34:49.322 --> 34:50.650
Here, I got you.
I got you.

34:50.650 --> 34:51.888
Just take a step down.

34:51.888 --> 34:52.987
- No.
- Just a little step.

34:52.987 --> 34:54.610
- It's okay, we got you.
- You're okay.

34:54.610 --> 34:56.554
We got you. / There you go.
There you go.

34:56.554 --> 34:58.093
You're okay.
You're okay.

34:58.093 --> 35:00.093
- You're okay.
- Okay.

35:00.998 --> 35:03.942
Oh, my God, Mr. Monk.
What were you doing?

35:03.942 --> 35:07.231
Oh, my... My God.
The guy...

35:07.231 --> 35:09.327
The guy who killed Rusty...

35:09.327 --> 35:11.143
The squeaky shoes.

35:11.143 --> 35:13.172
He's here. He's here.

35:13.172 --> 35:14.494
"Eddie Murdoch."

35:18.617 --> 35:20.412
Here, I got you.

35:25.784 --> 35:27.360
That's him.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.607
It's Eddie Murdoch.

35:30.221 --> 35:34.246
Must've been up there
lookin' for you, and slipped.

35:35.463 --> 35:37.608
Well, I guess that's it.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.822
Case closed!

35:48.680 --> 35:51.049
I think I have some good news.

35:51.049 --> 35:52.975
The optic nerves appear to be healing,

35:52.975 --> 35:55.250
and your pupils are starting to dilate.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.574
I'm cautiously optimistic.

35:58.846 --> 36:02.830
- Is that how he takes good news?
- Yeah, it is.

36:03.043 --> 36:06.227
If you could just stick around for a bit,
I'd like to show these to my colleagues.

36:06.227 --> 36:07.905
Be right back. / Thank you, doctor.
We'll be here.

36:07.905 --> 36:09.922
Isn't that great?
She sounded so hopeful.

36:09.922 --> 36:11.191
Hope.

36:11.191 --> 36:13.062
I hate Hope's guts.

36:13.062 --> 36:15.089
Hey, what happened
to all your confidence?

36:15.089 --> 36:18.573
I don't know, Leland.
Maybe I dropped it

36:18.573 --> 36:22.153
when I was screaming for help
ten inches off the ground.

36:22.153 --> 36:24.429
I am so pathetic.

36:24.429 --> 36:28.257
I'm half the man I was,
which was 3/4 of a man.

36:28.257 --> 36:30.305
- And so now I'm...
- 5/16 of a man.

36:30.305 --> 36:31.490
Thank you, Randy.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.811
Oh, no, wait...
3/8 of a man.

36:33.811 --> 36:37.691
Hey, would you quit whining?
The bad guy's on a slab downstairs.

36:37.691 --> 36:40.657
We get to go home.
In my book, that's a good day.

36:40.657 --> 36:42.620
Monk, he is definitely the guy.

36:42.620 --> 36:44.009
I just came back from his house.

36:44.009 --> 36:46.096
We found the clothes he was
wearing when he set the fire.

36:46.096 --> 36:47.953
They were in a laundry hamper,
covered with soot.

36:47.953 --> 36:49.271
You guys, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

36:49.271 --> 36:50.616
I have to go get Julie.

36:50.616 --> 36:53.060
You kids take off.
I'll stay here with Captain Sunshine.

36:53.060 --> 36:54.899
Hey, I can drop you off?

36:54.899 --> 36:58.102
- New wheels.
- Oh, so you went with the Ford.

36:58.102 --> 37:00.498
Yeah, I didn't like the way
the Ferrari handled.

37:00.498 --> 37:04.219
Or the way they turned down
my credit application.

37:05.165 --> 37:08.352
Yeah. Cool, huh?

37:08.352 --> 37:11.524
I went with the four cylinder,
instead of the six. It's quicker.

37:11.524 --> 37:14.264
Oh, and white,
with tan cloth interior.

37:14.264 --> 37:16.288
Leather makes me sweat.

37:16.593 --> 37:19.349
- Yeah, I need those.
- All right, we gotta go. We gotta go.

37:19.349 --> 37:21.720
Okay, bye, Mr. Monk.
We'll see you tomorrow.

37:21.720 --> 37:24.149
Why did he do it?

37:24.354 --> 37:28.507
- Why did who do what?
- Why did Eddie Murdoch kill that girl?

37:28.507 --> 37:30.665
Since when does a creep
need a reason?

37:30.665 --> 37:33.851
You remember when
we were talking to Peter Breen?

37:33.851 --> 37:36.230
Murdoch came walking up.

37:36.230 --> 37:37.738
Do you remember what he said?

37:37.738 --> 37:42.515
Yeah, he said,
"I still have those keys."

37:42.851 --> 37:46.106
Peter Breen drives a Ferrari, right?

37:46.106 --> 37:48.067
That's right.

37:49.085 --> 37:52.233
What do their key chains look like?

37:52.233 --> 37:54.889
It's a rearing horse.

37:55.673 --> 38:00.090
The impression on the coffee table.
Those were Breen's keys.

38:00.090 --> 38:03.772
- You said Murdoch's body's on a slab?
- Downstairs.

38:09.735 --> 38:11.169
Hello?

38:12.659 --> 38:15.775
Well, we've got the place
to ourselves, so to speak.

38:17.882 --> 38:19.617
Do you see him?
Do you see Eddie Murdoch?

38:19.617 --> 38:22.036
No. Not yet.

38:22.594 --> 38:24.608
Wh... What do you see?

38:25.236 --> 38:29.369
Uh... people.
Bloated.

38:29.656 --> 38:32.401
Laying around, not talking.

38:32.652 --> 38:36.258
Kind of like Thanksgiving
at my ex-wife's house.

38:36.747 --> 38:39.002
So you think the keys
were still in his pocket?

38:39.002 --> 38:40.512
Oh, it's worth a shot.

38:40.512 --> 38:45.154
Eddie Murdoch killed Stefanie Preston.
There's no question about that.

38:45.154 --> 38:47.282
But it wasn't his idea.

38:47.931 --> 38:51.231
His boss paid him to do it.

38:51.639 --> 38:54.756
- So Breen was having the affair.
- Exactly.

38:54.756 --> 38:57.667
He had keys to her house.

38:57.667 --> 39:02.151
Loaned 'em to Eddie Murdoch
so Murdoch could sneak in and kill her.

39:02.151 --> 39:05.442
He went back for the keys.
That's what he went back for.

39:05.442 --> 39:07.995
Right. And if we find those keys...

39:07.995 --> 39:11.901
Mr. Breen's gonna
have a lot of explaining to do.

39:11.901 --> 39:13.373
Got him.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.801
Hello, Edward.

39:15.991 --> 39:17.551
Don't get up.

39:17.803 --> 39:21.520
They usually keep the personal effects
in a plastic bag.

39:21.520 --> 39:23.011
Bingo!

39:24.809 --> 39:26.610
Well?

39:30.147 --> 39:33.279
Exhibit A.
D.A.'s gonna love this.

39:33.279 --> 39:35.411
Can I feel?

39:36.145 --> 39:37.904
That's it.

39:39.125 --> 39:41.047
Leland, what happened?

39:41.660 --> 39:43.277
Leland!

39:44.938 --> 39:47.719
Mr. Monk,
I'm gonna need that key ring.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.885
Help, somebody!

39:55.780 --> 39:57.484
The keys, please.

39:57.779 --> 40:00.391
Oh, I don't have time for this.

40:01.569 --> 40:04.226
Actually, it's pretty convenient
you're both already here.

40:04.226 --> 40:07.462
That way, they won't
have to move the bodies.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.350
Don't move.

40:14.238 --> 40:15.896
Don't move.

40:54.363 --> 40:55.502
Captain.

40:57.030 --> 40:58.069
Captain?

40:58.611 --> 40:59.759
You okay?

40:59.934 --> 41:01.196
You okay?

41:03.306 --> 41:04.675
You all right?

41:05.497 --> 41:06.881
Monk...

41:07.135 --> 41:09.623
- You can see me.
- Yeah.

41:09.916 --> 41:12.145
- Hello.
- Hello.
