07:57.709 --> 07:59.609
Football.
- [chuckles]

07:59.709 --> 08:01.210
- Um, quick crisis chat.

08:01.310 --> 08:02.610
- Oh, can we just--
please, can we stop

08:02.710 --> 08:04.090
calling them crisis chats?

08:04.190 --> 08:06.331
That's my first point
of order for the chat.

08:06.431 --> 08:09.931
- Okay, um, Suzie, sorry.
- Yeah?

08:10.031 --> 08:12.332
- Can I just confirm
that you're not sleeping

08:12.432 --> 08:14.812
with Danny Carno?

08:14.912 --> 08:17.853
- [laughing] I-- no, no.

08:17.953 --> 08:20.253
I mean, we've only--

08:20.353 --> 08:22.413
No, we haven't.
I'm not.

08:22.513 --> 08:24.814
[knock at the door]
Yeah?

08:24.914 --> 08:27.014
- Hey, um, shall we trot you
over to Danny and Ollie now?

08:27.114 --> 08:29.214
- Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you get my boots?

08:29.314 --> 08:30.415
- Yeah.
- Not the real ones.

08:30.515 --> 08:32.215
- Okay, one sec.

08:32.315 --> 08:33.775
She needs the not-real boots.

08:33.875 --> 08:35.936
- Right, got you.

08:36.036 --> 08:37.296
- Sorry, yeah.

08:37.396 --> 08:39.376
- Okay, well, if--if--if
someone's managed to get

08:39.476 --> 08:42.697
that idea,
do you have any idea how?

08:42.797 --> 08:44.417
- No.

08:44.517 --> 08:48.338
I mean, you know, I can say
we've been friendly, you know.

08:48.438 --> 08:53.419
We're going through
something together, way, but--

08:53.519 --> 08:55.819
- Could someone have
seen you like that?

08:55.919 --> 08:57.339
- No.
Not really, no.

08:57.439 --> 08:59.940
- Okay. Well, the "Daily Mail"
have called us.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.100
- Uh-huh.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.500
- And they're asking
for comment

09:02.600 --> 09:04.300
because they want
to print it in the morning.

09:04.400 --> 09:08.221
- Yeah, they're saying
they've spoken to a runner.

09:08.321 --> 09:10.502
- Like, just so that I can do
my job here.

09:10.602 --> 09:13.462
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
No, no, of--of course.

09:13.562 --> 09:15.702
I mean, he's
married, by the way.

09:15.802 --> 09:16.983
- Yeah.

09:17.083 --> 09:19.543
- So I can deny that
with confidence?

09:19.643 --> 09:20.823
[knock at the door]

09:20.923 --> 09:21.983
- Um, I'm just
going to go upstairs

09:22.083 --> 09:24.024
and rehearse the lift, but, no.

09:24.124 --> 09:26.024
I'm sorry, as in yes.
[laughs]

09:26.124 --> 09:28.585
You get it. [laughs]
- Oh, great.

09:28.685 --> 09:30.345
Sorry.
[door opens]

09:30.445 --> 09:32.505
- Why don't I take it over, and
we can go to makeup afterwards?

09:32.605 --> 09:34.706
- You say that like
I've got a choice.

09:34.806 --> 09:36.506
No.

09:36.606 --> 09:37.866
- Can I get you anything?

09:37.966 --> 09:39.146
- Uh, no, no, no,
I'm absolutely fine.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.227
- Okay, right.
- How are you doing?

09:40.327 --> 09:41.627
- Yeah.
No, I'm good.

09:41.727 --> 09:42.907
I just want to make sure
that you're all right.

09:43.007 --> 09:44.027
- Yeah.
[digital ringtone]

09:44.127 --> 09:45.027
Oh, sorry.
That's my mum.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.028
One minute.
- Okay.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.628
- Hello, Mum?

09:47.728 --> 09:48.948
Yeah.

09:49.048 --> 09:49.948
No, we're all--
we're all good here.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.228
Yeah.
No, I know.

09:51.328 --> 09:53.429
Uh, yeah, because of football.
Yeah--

09:53.529 --> 09:57.830
Well, no, it has to be live
live because the voting.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.390
Okay, fine.

09:59.490 --> 10:01.550
I mean, if Dad can't make it,
he can't make it.

10:01.650 --> 10:02.790
No, he shouldn't drive.

10:02.890 --> 10:04.231
Yeah.
All right, Mum.

10:04.331 --> 10:06.031
I'm just about to go
on national television,

10:06.131 --> 10:08.271
so I can't really chat,
but Naomi's going to do

10:08.371 --> 10:09.992
the handover in reception.

10:10.092 --> 10:11.232
Yeah, and you got the tickets?

10:11.332 --> 10:12.712
Yeah, I sent them on text.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.232
All right, Mum.
All right.

10:14.332 --> 10:15.033
Okay.

10:15.133 --> 10:17.673
See you later.
Bye.

10:17.773 --> 10:19.273
Um, sorry.

10:19.373 --> 10:21.154
Oh, one of my audience seats
has become available.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.634
I'm really sorry.
I know that's really...

10:22.734 --> 10:23.834
- Okay.
- Late notice.

10:23.934 --> 10:25.674
Good to know, yeah.
- Yeah.

10:25.774 --> 10:27.835
And, um, it's just--

10:27.935 --> 10:30.795
I know I can be stress-y.

10:30.895 --> 10:34.396
Like I know--it's the show
and the stress of the show,

10:34.496 --> 10:36.396
and sometimes I-I realise I can
be very short

10:36.496 --> 10:38.116
with people when I'm--
- Oh, my God, no, no, no, no

10:38.216 --> 10:40.277
- So I'm just--I'm sorry is
what I'm trying to say.

10:40.377 --> 10:41.917
- No--the seat--
this is what we're here for.

10:42.017 --> 10:42.957
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:43.057 --> 10:43.997
- Okay.
- Like, no.

10:44.097 --> 10:45.038
- Really?
- No, no, never.

10:45.138 --> 10:46.038
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

10:46.138 --> 10:47.278
- Thank you.
- Okay.

10:47.378 --> 10:48.638
- Thank you.
I'm sorry for this.

10:48.738 --> 10:50.439
[applause]

10:50.539 --> 10:51.839
- Ollie?
Ollie?

10:51.939 --> 10:53.759
I've got Suzie for you.
- Oh, thank God.

10:53.859 --> 10:54.959
Okay, great.
- Hi.

10:55.059 --> 10:56.400
I'm sorry.
- That's fine.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.880
The audience is there, right?

10:57.980 --> 10:59.240
Apparently, the lift is fine.
- Yes.

10:59.340 --> 11:00.680
- So don't worry about that.

11:00.780 --> 11:01.921
We're just going to use that
fish rave step

11:02.021 --> 11:03.361
to get us forward, okay?

11:03.461 --> 11:05.041
So we're going to go like
this--one, two, three,

11:05.141 --> 11:06.521
four, five, six, seven, eight,
one and two.

11:06.621 --> 11:08.362
The rest is as is, so just
run it from there, okay?

11:08.462 --> 11:09.802
- Yeah, uh...
- Okay.

11:09.902 --> 11:12.242
- Uh, five, six, seven, eight.
Go.

11:12.342 --> 11:14.883
- Danny, someone fucking
knows about our thing.

11:14.983 --> 11:16.523
- I know.
- No, you don't.

11:16.623 --> 11:18.443
- Yeah, PR just texted me.
- Okay.

11:18.543 --> 11:20.124
So what are we going
to do about it?

11:20.224 --> 11:21.464
- Guys, I really do need
you to step it out more, okay?

11:21.544 --> 11:22.884
Left, right, left, right,
like that.

11:22.984 --> 11:24.484
Okay?
- Yeah.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.525
- Yeah. We got it. We'll do it.
- Yeah, we've got it.

11:26.625 --> 11:28.205
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, we'll run it.

11:28.305 --> 11:29.605
- Do your thing.
- Okay, great.

11:29.705 --> 11:31.166
So I've got to go
and work with Stella.

11:31.266 --> 11:32.646
You know, in fact,
her individual number,

11:32.746 --> 11:34.646
she's on first, so just run it
a couple of times.

11:34.746 --> 11:36.446
Any problems, just...
[smooches] All right?

11:36.546 --> 11:37.727
- Bye.
- I need to chat with you.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.367
- Okay.
Um--um, Una?

11:39.467 --> 11:42.367
Uh, I would love, um,
something to drink.

11:42.467 --> 11:44.448
Something sweet
but nothing from here.

11:44.548 --> 11:47.088
Like, something
from my dressing room.

11:47.188 --> 11:50.689
You know what I mean.
- Uh--uh--

11:50.789 --> 11:52.689
Okay, um...

11:52.789 --> 11:56.530
- Look...
I can't go on tonight

11:56.630 --> 11:58.890
thinking this is the last time
we dance together.

11:58.990 --> 12:01.371
- But it's the finals.
- Yeah, I know.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.891
But I don't want it
to be the final for us.

12:02.991 --> 12:04.691
- Okay, but maybe we--
should we just get

12:04.791 --> 12:06.692
our stories straight first?
- Well, let 'em print it.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.812
I mean, fuck it, it's true.

12:08.912 --> 12:10.172
Maybe something
needed to break.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.453
You know what?
It's time.

12:12.553 --> 12:15.053
I told you, I love Carrie.
- Mm-hmm?

12:15.153 --> 12:16.693
- She's known me
since I was 14.

12:16.793 --> 12:18.534
But she doesn't really
know me, you know?

12:18.634 --> 12:22.254
I spoke to you
about all that stuff

12:22.354 --> 12:24.535
with Rob and all that.
- Mm-hmm?

12:24.635 --> 12:27.375
- And you're the only person
who gets it, you know?

12:27.475 --> 12:30.656
You get what it is
to compartmentalise your life.

12:30.756 --> 12:34.176
You get being famous and not
being able to be yourself.

12:34.276 --> 12:36.217
You know, you--you get me.
- [laughs]

12:36.317 --> 12:39.457
- And I just--I don't know--
I can't keep living this life,

12:39.557 --> 12:40.697
you know?

12:40.797 --> 12:42.578
- Maybe this isn't something
to be decided

12:42.678 --> 12:44.378
on the most stressful night
of your life

12:44.478 --> 12:46.378
when your dad just died.
- No, but it is.

12:46.478 --> 12:49.339
It's like...
it's like I'm next.

12:49.439 --> 12:51.379
And I know it's been
no time with us.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.220
- I know, it's been a week.
- Yeah.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.780
But maybe that's
a wake-up call.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.540
- Or a snooze button.
You know?

12:56.640 --> 12:59.061
- I just, I feel weirdly alive.
This is--

12:59.161 --> 13:01.701
[people cheer]
Oh, someone must've scored.

13:01.801 --> 13:03.221
Last minute.

13:03.321 --> 13:05.902
- Okay. Hi, so we're not
going to penalty.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.262
So ten minutes
till the show starts.

13:07.362 --> 13:08.462
Just do makeup, I'm sorry.
- Okay, fine.

13:08.562 --> 13:10.142
Sorry.
- It's quite all right.

13:10.242 --> 13:12.063
- See you on the pitch.
- See you on the pitch.

13:12.163 --> 13:14.743
- Um, this way,
this way, this way.

13:14.843 --> 13:16.704
Whoo!

13:16.804 --> 13:20.424
[suspenseful music]

13:20.524 --> 13:22.585
- Which way?
Which way?

13:22.685 --> 13:24.345
- Sorry, left.

13:24.445 --> 13:25.665
Left.

13:25.765 --> 13:28.666
Through.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.026
Two minutes out.

13:30.126 --> 13:34.147
[indistinct chatter]

13:34.247 --> 13:38.027
- Um, Suzie, we should--
[high-pitched ringing]

13:38.127 --> 13:39.868
- Oh.

13:39.968 --> 13:42.548
Um, my stomach's really bad.

13:42.648 --> 13:45.508
I really need to go to the loo.
- Well, it's just there, so--

13:45.608 --> 13:47.269
- Actually, I could
really do with my fags.

13:47.369 --> 13:50.829
Can you go to my dressing room?
I think they're in there.

13:50.929 --> 13:52.230
And then I'll meet you
in costume.

13:52.330 --> 13:53.590
- I can get someone
else to bring them.

13:53.690 --> 13:55.030
- No, I can go to
the loo, it's fine.

13:55.130 --> 13:56.430
- Okay, Okay.

13:56.530 --> 13:57.631
[alarm blaring,
ringing continues]

13:57.731 --> 13:58.871
- Seriously!
Relax!

13:58.971 --> 13:59.911
Relax!

14:00.011 --> 14:02.211
[blaring intensifies]

14:12.653 --> 14:15.474
[door closes]

14:15.574 --> 14:17.434
- Suzie!

14:17.534 --> 14:19.074
Can you believe
I'm on first tonight?

14:19.174 --> 14:20.474
I'm late.
- Mm.

14:20.574 --> 14:21.595
Hi.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.435
- And they've changed
my routine.

14:23.535 --> 14:25.995
It's just not cool.
- I've just--I've got to go.

14:26.095 --> 14:27.676
Because my son's
having a tantrum downstairs.

14:27.776 --> 14:29.396
- Listen, I know we
haven't spoken very much.

14:29.496 --> 14:31.236
And I wish you all the
good in the world tonight,

14:31.336 --> 14:33.077
because at some point,
I would love to pick

14:33.177 --> 14:34.637
your brains about acting.
- Oh!

14:34.737 --> 14:36.117
- Ultimately, that's
something I'd love to explore.

14:36.217 --> 14:37.557
- Oh, amazing.
- Like, drama school?

14:37.657 --> 14:39.718
Is that necessary or not?
I know you didn't.

14:39.818 --> 14:41.518
And sometimes I actually
think actors never--

14:41.618 --> 14:43.558
- Can we talk about it later?
- I can give you my email.

14:43.658 --> 14:45.719
And then you can email me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

14:45.819 --> 14:47.359
- Whenever. Okay.
- Sure, sure.

14:47.459 --> 14:49.719
- So you give me your email,
and I'll email you my email.

14:49.819 --> 14:54.080
- Okay, it's suzielegendary222
@suzielegend.com.

14:54.180 --> 14:55.160
Okay?
- Okay.

14:55.260 --> 14:56.441
- Someone else set that up.

14:56.541 --> 14:57.881
- I'm just saying,
you do not need

14:57.981 --> 14:59.161
to email me back in the email.
- Got it.

14:59.261 --> 15:01.401
- Okay.
Bye.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.642
She's so nice.

15:02.742 --> 15:05.082
I'm obsessed with her.

15:05.182 --> 15:07.262
[door opens]

15:10.503 --> 15:12.603
[phone ringing]

15:12.703 --> 15:14.704
- Fuck!

15:16.664 --> 15:20.125
Fuck!
Phone!

15:20.225 --> 15:22.565
- Is your finger okay?

15:22.665 --> 15:24.685
- My...?

15:24.785 --> 15:26.246
Yeah.
Uh...

15:26.346 --> 15:29.726
- Well, that's good, isn't it?
- No, not this time.

15:29.826 --> 15:31.807
But, you know, it's a marathon.

15:31.907 --> 15:34.327
- Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, mate, that's...

15:34.427 --> 15:36.887
- I really don't particularly
want to talk about it.

whoa, what the fuck?

No, no, Fred!
Fred, no!

15:47.309 --> 15:48.730
- Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

15:48.830 --> 15:50.450
What's the issue?
What's the issue?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.650
- Hey! No.
Calm down. Calm down.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.170
Understand?

15:54.270 --> 15:55.491
- He didn't want
to leave his dad.

15:55.591 --> 15:57.091
- He wanted to
watch the football, so...

15:57.191 --> 15:58.571
Which to be fair--

15:58.671 --> 16:00.452
- I didn't know whether to
physically tear him away.

16:00.552 --> 16:02.052
- Yeah. No, it's not ideal.
Okay. Hello.

16:02.152 --> 16:03.612
- Yeah.
- Right.

16:03.712 --> 16:06.052
Okay, anyway, having not
heard from your people,

16:06.152 --> 16:07.293
I assume he's staying
with me tomorrow.

16:07.393 --> 16:08.533
So maybe I'll just
take him home.

16:08.633 --> 16:10.013
- We just haven't
heard back yet.

16:10.113 --> 16:11.453
It's there's a backlog
because of this.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.654
- Great. It's not one day
he's acting up, is it?

16:13.754 --> 16:14.894
He's hasn't seen it.

16:14.994 --> 16:16.334
He's the same room
for six months.

16:16.434 --> 16:21.155
- Do you remember how
we talked about tonight?

16:28.396 --> 16:30.257
Okay, well,
you haven't, Frank.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.137
- Yes, he has pretty much
watched every game.

16:32.237 --> 16:33.897
So in fairness to him--

16:33.997 --> 16:37.418
- It would--it would mean
a lot to me

16:37.518 --> 16:40.098
if you stayed

16:40.198 --> 16:44.299
and watched Mummy dance.

16:44.399 --> 16:46.139
- Yeah, I've said
all this to him.

16:46.239 --> 16:51.000
- You've been so helpful,
and we've done this together.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.701
No, Dad can't come.

16:53.801 --> 16:55.801
But Bailey's here.

16:57.921 --> 16:59.142
Oh, well, that's
new information.

16:59.242 --> 17:00.782
- He doesn't want
to be here, Suzie.

17:00.882 --> 17:02.462
- That's not what he's saying.
- Yeah. Do you know what?

17:02.562 --> 17:04.262
If you'd let me finish,
what I was going to say is,

17:04.362 --> 17:05.783
he doesn't want to be here.

17:05.883 --> 17:07.463
So why don't I just come and
sit with him for a while?

17:07.563 --> 17:09.583
- There isn't anywhere.
There isn't any passes.

Hiya.
- Grandma's here!

17:20.885 --> 17:22.145
- Oh, Suzie, hi.
- Oh, hello!

17:22.245 --> 17:23.506
- Football's actually
just finished,

17:23.606 --> 17:25.226
so we actually need
to get you to makeup

17:25.326 --> 17:26.786
and get you into makeup
and get everyone set down,

17:26.886 --> 17:28.467

literally just about to start.

just like you, Cob.

got a spare seat.

- Mum, can we not?
Okay?

17:42.089 --> 17:43.109
We can't--
- She's got a spare seat.

17:43.209 --> 17:44.349

17:44.449 --> 17:45.589
There's a rule
in the house, okay?

17:45.689 --> 17:47.230

about that.

17:47.330 --> 17:48.470

background-checked,

17:48.570 --> 17:49.990
that you've been
background-checked.

17:50.090 --> 17:51.711
Oh, my God, anyway,
Dad doesn't want to.

17:51.811 --> 17:53.871
- Listen, I will do anything
just to make sure he's okay.

17:53.971 --> 17:55.151
- Yeah, exactly.
Come on, it's Christmas.

17:55.251 --> 17:56.311

17:56.411 --> 17:57.872
- Oh, excuse me,
it's Christmas.

17:57.972 --> 17:59.472
- No, Cob, you might not
actually want to go in there.

17:59.572 --> 18:01.432
- Well, was that
a Christmas present, Cob,

18:01.532 --> 18:03.312
when you sent
him home with no hair?

18:03.412 --> 18:04.713
- I beg your pardon?

18:04.813 --> 18:06.473
He's entitled to do what
he wants with his hair.

18:06.573 --> 18:08.113
- Never said anything
about wanting to cut his hair.

earlier than now.

What I want to do is offer
them something different.

22:08.014 --> 22:09.354
I mean, you sometimes
see that, right?

22:09.454 --> 22:11.275
- I have, on occasion,
thrown other clients

22:11.375 --> 22:12.955
under the bus for you.

22:13.055 --> 22:14.955
But obviously I wouldn't do
that to you for someone else.

22:15.055 --> 22:16.516
- Yeah.
- So you did.

22:16.616 --> 22:18.316
You have with Danny
after, you know, months

22:18.416 --> 22:20.636
of our trying
to turn you around.

22:20.736 --> 22:24.677
- So offer them
that my ex-husband wants

22:24.777 --> 22:27.958
to take my son away from me
at Christmas

22:28.058 --> 22:29.438
for doing this show--

22:29.538 --> 22:31.558
that, basically,
because I've got a job,

22:31.658 --> 22:34.519
my ex wants to separate
a mother from her son.

22:34.619 --> 22:37.479
And that he insists
I do drug testing.

22:37.579 --> 22:39.800
- Okay, well, it's going to be
obvious that it came from you.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.760
- Okay, well, not really,
because my friend's

22:41.860 --> 22:43.320
been dealing with all the texts
and emails,

22:43.420 --> 22:44.560
and I can provide those,

22:44.660 --> 22:47.201
because, basically,
this is true.

22:47.301 --> 22:50.401
I mean, that's just--that's
what's amazing about it,

22:50.501 --> 22:53.202
is we could swap this story
for the Danny story.

22:53.302 --> 22:55.842
And what's great is that
everything that I'm saying

22:55.942 --> 22:57.603
is that it's true.

22:57.703 --> 22:58.763
It's incredible.

22:58.863 --> 23:00.283
Actually, he's just
telling the truth.

23:00.383 --> 23:01.843
I don't have to
remember anything.

23:01.943 --> 23:04.804
- Do you know how hard it was
to get you on this show?

23:04.904 --> 23:06.804
And then to get you back on it?

23:06.904 --> 23:08.004
- Yeah, they're not going to go

23:08.104 --> 23:09.965
with the harrowing
custody dispute.

23:10.065 --> 23:11.405
They're going to go

23:11.505 --> 23:13.165
with two people fuck
in a dance competition.

23:13.265 --> 23:16.126
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:16.226 --> 23:18.806
- Really? Because I'm not
the story here

23:18.906 --> 23:22.167
when it comes to Danny Carno
and affairs, okay?

23:22.267 --> 23:24.447
And not just with women.

23:24.547 --> 23:26.688
So I think that's
more of the story.

23:26.788 --> 23:28.688
- We can't out him.
He's a footballer.

23:28.788 --> 23:33.369
- Okay, sure, but he would be
winning as a bisexual man.

23:33.469 --> 23:35.449
They literally have
no representation at all.

23:35.549 --> 23:36.729
- Right?

23:36.829 --> 23:39.290
- Oh, I think we've just
found Holland's line.

23:39.390 --> 23:41.090
Look, I'm just saying
what's true, all right?

23:41.190 --> 23:42.770
You can do what
you want with that.

23:42.870 --> 23:44.611
- Okay, well, there's some
lines that we just don't cross.

23:44.711 --> 23:45.931
Okay?
- Well--

23:46.031 --> 23:47.371
- Hey, Suzie,
you're due onstage.

23:47.471 --> 23:50.492
Can anyone not involved
in the show leave?

23:50.592 --> 23:53.652
