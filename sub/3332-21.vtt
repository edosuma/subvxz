00:00.001 --> 00:02.501
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, let's do this.</i>

00:02.503 --> 00:04.036
<i>Jane, you'll recall,</i>
<i>was engaged to michael.</i>

00:04.038 --> 00:05.471
<i>And rafael was married</i>
<i>to petra.</i>

00:05.473 --> 00:07.206
<i>But then, jane was</i>
<i>accidentally inseminated</i>

00:07.208 --> 00:10.309
<i>With rafael's sperm,</i>
<i>and the doctor who did it,</i>

00:10.311 --> 00:12.144
<i>Well that was</i>
<i>raf's sister, luisa.</i>

00:12.146 --> 00:14.680
<i>But on the plus side,</i>
<i>jane and rafael fell in love,</i>

00:14.682 --> 00:19.351
<i>But things were going great</i>
<i>between jane and rafael.</i>

00:19.353 --> 00:20.452
<i>Until they weren't.</i>

00:20.454 --> 00:22.354
<i>See, rafael's father died,</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:24.490
<i>And his hotel was failing,</i>

00:24.492 --> 00:25.724
<i>So he kind of freaked out</i>

00:25.726 --> 00:27.059
<i>And dumped jane,</i>

00:27.061 --> 00:28.394
<i>Leaving her miserable.</i>

00:28.396 --> 00:31.163
<i>Also heartbroken--</i>
<i>jane's mother.</i>

00:31.165 --> 00:33.766
<i>See, she had gotten together</i>
<i>with jane's long-lost father,</i>

00:33.768 --> 00:35.200
<i>Telenovela star</i>
<i>rogelio de la vega,</i>

00:35.202 --> 00:36.769
<i>And things were going great.</i>

00:36.771 --> 00:39.805
<i>He even included her in his</i>
<i>one-night las vegas residency.</i>

00:39.807 --> 00:42.674
<i>Only problem--</i>
<i>xo kind of kissed her ex.</i>

00:42.676 --> 00:44.510
<i>So rogelio dumped her,</i>
<i>and now they're making a go</i>

00:44.512 --> 00:45.778
<i>Of being just friends.</i>

00:45.780 --> 00:48.514
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>jane was trying to focus on</i>

00:48.516 --> 00:51.083
<i>What was best for her baby,</i>
<i>and you know what wasn't best?</i>

00:51.085 --> 00:53.485
<i>Being around petra</i>
<i>and her devious mother magda.</i>

00:53.487 --> 00:54.720
<i>Magda, you'll recall,</i>
<i>pushed jane's grandmother</i>

00:54.722 --> 00:56.188
<i>Down the stairs.</i>

00:56.190 --> 00:57.389
<i>And petra lied to cover it up.</i>

00:57.391 --> 00:59.124
<i>And unfortunately, this led</i>

00:59.126 --> 01:00.426
<i>To a lot of tension</i>
<i>between jane and rafael.</i>

01:00.428 --> 01:02.227
<i>So jane quit her job</i>
<i>and decided to file</i>

01:02.229 --> 01:03.595
<i>For sole custody of the baby.</i>

01:03.597 --> 01:08.300
<i>But rafael doesn't</i>
<i>know that, yet.</i>

01:08.302 --> 01:10.069
(school bell rings)

01:10.071 --> 01:12.071
<i>Knowing jane as well</i>
<i>as you do by now,</i>

01:12.073 --> 01:14.073
<i>It should come as no surprise</i>

01:14.075 --> 01:16.608
<i>That even back in high school,</i>
<i>she was a planner.</i>

01:20.580 --> 01:21.647
What?

01:25.518 --> 01:26.718
What the...?

01:26.720 --> 01:29.755
<i>Unfortunately for young jane,</i>

01:29.757 --> 01:32.191
<i>Someone in high school</i>
<i>knew her very well, too.</i>

01:32.193 --> 01:34.760
Oh, did you
miss the fair?

01:34.762 --> 01:35.861
<i>Her personal tormentor.</i>

01:41.568 --> 01:42.668
You know, you really
shouldn't leave

01:42.670 --> 01:44.403
Your planner
lying around

01:44.405 --> 01:46.105
Where everyone
can see it.

01:49.809 --> 01:53.846
<i>However, they say living well</i>
<i>is the best revenge.</i>

01:53.848 --> 01:57.850
And after high school, jane was
<i>living very well indeed.</i>

01:57.852 --> 01:59.852
<i>Whereas stephanie,</i>
<i>according to gossip,</i>

01:59.854 --> 02:01.753
<i>Had dropped out of college.</i>

02:01.755 --> 02:04.123
<i>So can we blame jane</i>
<i>for being eager</i>

02:04.125 --> 02:06.825
<i>To show her that nice girls</i>
<i>finish first?</i>

02:10.797 --> 02:12.798
May 9th, put it
in your calendar.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.433
Well, you are
my calendar.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.835
Just tell me
where to be and when.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.670
Seriously?
I'll write it down.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.905
In the new date book
that I gave you.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.507
In the new date book
that you gave me.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.143
<i>But now, one year,</i>
<i>two break-ups,</i>

02:24.145 --> 02:26.345
<i>And an accidental</i>
<i>pregnancy later,</i>

02:26.347 --> 02:29.781
<i>Jane was no longer so eager</i>
<i>to show off anything.</i>

02:29.783 --> 02:33.452
Put that post-it
back right now.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.288
I'm not going.
Having this five-year
reunion was your idea.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.689
You were on the planning
committee.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.358
Before I got pregnant.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.792
I have too much writing to
do before the baby comes.

02:40.794 --> 02:43.462
So I need to make
the most of it.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.831
You can take off
one night.
I really can't.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.833
I'm on a schedule--
ten pages a day.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.668
Can you tell her
she has to go?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.303
To the reunion?
(scoffs)

02:51.305 --> 02:53.305
I tried-- she's crazy
with this schedule.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.541
You were supposed
to give a speech, jane.

02:55.543 --> 02:58.744
I'm pretty sure the class of
2010 can live without my speech.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.179
Come on.

03:00.181 --> 03:03.348
Alex mendez rsvp'd yes.

03:04.617 --> 03:05.851
So?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.853
So you had
a huge crush on him.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.922
And remember,
you two were vibing

03:09.924 --> 03:10.856
At the graduation
party?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.291
You two vibed?

03:12.293 --> 03:13.725
You didn't tell me.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.327
Yeah, because nothing happened.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.929
And I'm not exactly
looking to meet a guy.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.231
We were vibing that
one time, though.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.333
It's janet, right?

03:21.335 --> 03:22.968
Stephanie:
(laughs) "janet."

03:22.970 --> 03:25.237
Did he just call you janet?

03:25.239 --> 03:27.339
That's hilarious.
(laughs)

03:27.341 --> 03:29.975
Stephanie kovakovich, one
more reason I shouldn't go.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.610
Are you kidding?

03:31.612 --> 03:34.446
She dropped off
of instagram last year.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.848
Which means
she looks terrible.

03:36.850 --> 03:37.950
Which means seeing her

03:37.952 --> 03:39.518
Will make you
feel better.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.520
Just like seeing
all the teachers

03:41.522 --> 03:43.222
Who worshipped you.

03:43.224 --> 03:45.490
Aw... Mr. Baird.
Aw...

03:45.492 --> 03:48.227
Jane, I can't wait to hear
what you've been up to.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.462
Look, this
isn't exactly

03:50.464 --> 03:52.864
The triumphant return I was
hoping to make, you know?

03:52.866 --> 03:56.702
I'm single,
unemployed, pregnant.

03:56.704 --> 03:57.970
I'm not exactly
accomplished.

03:57.972 --> 03:59.838
Okay, first of all,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.907
You are going to have one
of the best stories there.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.009
And you're
very accomplished.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.344
You graduated college,

04:05.346 --> 04:07.746
You wrote an episode
for a telenovela,

04:07.748 --> 04:09.748
And you were offered
a teaching job

04:09.750 --> 04:11.450
Which you turned down
to write your novel.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.952
Come on,
how ballsy is that?

04:13.954 --> 04:16.355
There was a reason you were
on the planning committee.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.690
Because you wanted
to go to that reunion.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.359
So be proud
of where you're at.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.361
I know I am.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.796
(scoffs)
you guys are so cheesy.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.032
Shut up, lina, you're
getting what you want.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.034
You guys are right.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.836
I'm overthinking.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.472
It'll be fun.

04:39.545 --> 04:41.913
Okay, target run-- which look
are you going for?

04:41.915 --> 04:45.384
I'll be giving...
"accidentally sexy bohemian."

04:45.386 --> 04:47.786
Not that, but can you
get me some lip gloss?

04:47.788 --> 04:48.954
Okay.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.022
(cell phone rings)
thank you.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.959
Your custody lawyer.
(sighs)

04:53.961 --> 04:56.061
He just wants to know
if I told rafael

04:56.063 --> 04:58.063
That I wanted
primary custody.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.331
Well, why haven't you?

04:59.333 --> 05:02.401
I just...

05:02.403 --> 05:04.403
It's not an easy
thing to say.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.039
I know he'll be upset.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.374
But I'm gonna
do it-- today.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.343
See?

05:11.345 --> 05:13.745
So... Here is the situation.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.081
The maracay board is calling
a vote in madrid.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.895
There's a push
to sell off the properties,

05:29.897 --> 05:31.897
Settle the debt
and dissolve the company.

05:31.899 --> 05:32.998
Sounds reasonable.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.033
It's not reasonable, luisa.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.035
I'm going there
to change their mind.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.037
Dad had multiple offers
through the years,

05:39.039 --> 05:40.872
And he turned them all down.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.708
He didn't want to sell
his company-- it was his legacy.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.676
Yeah...

05:44.678 --> 05:46.044
That's a tough call.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.051
You think so? Really?

05:53.053 --> 05:55.053
Because, to me, it sounds
like a no-brainer.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.055
We unload and
divide the money.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.925
You keep the marbella-- that's
outside of the maracay group.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.593
Dad didn't want that.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.595
Raf, dad's dead.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.364
We have to move on.

06:05.366 --> 06:08.367
Respectfully...

06:08.369 --> 06:10.602
I'm gonna let you two
hash this out.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.603
Bye, babe.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.637
Bye, you.

06:12.639 --> 06:13.772
Mmm, bye, you.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.841
(computer beeps)

06:19.379 --> 06:21.613
Latin lover narrator: <i>You see,</i>
<i>rafael had a calendar too.</i>

06:21.615 --> 06:24.683
<i>And he knew it had been</i>
<i>two weeks since jane quit.</i>

06:26.686 --> 06:29.121
<i>Two weeks</i>
<i>since he had seen her.</i>

06:29.123 --> 06:30.789
(heart beating rapidly)

06:34.394 --> 06:35.894
Luisa:
Raf.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.964
Sorry.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.503
Look, I've been thinking
about what you said.

06:44.505 --> 06:47.639
About selling?
No, about jane.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.808
And whether or not
I'd be happy

06:49.810 --> 06:51.810
Without her, long-term...

06:51.812 --> 06:53.812
And I wouldn't.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.480
I mean, I'm not.

06:56.649 --> 06:58.650
Luisa...

06:58.652 --> 07:01.052
I think I made a mistake.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.622
I shouldn't have broken up
with jane.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.091
I'll just be firm with rafael.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.161
I'll tell him it's
for the baby's safety.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.462
(doorbell rings)

07:10.464 --> 07:12.798
Dad's here. Good.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.065
You okay, mom?

07:14.067 --> 07:15.600
You ready to see him?

07:15.602 --> 07:16.735
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.171
Don't worry, I'm over him.

07:19.173 --> 07:21.106
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Rogelio and xo were</i>
<i>trying out friendship,</i>

07:21.108 --> 07:24.810
<i>You'll recall... Only they</i>
<i>hadn't exactly tried it yet.</i>

07:24.812 --> 07:26.144
Jane!
Hey!

07:26.146 --> 07:29.147
I've missed you.
Oh... Okay!
(chuckles)

07:29.149 --> 07:31.149
Be careful,
there's a baby in there.
Yes.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.485
Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes.

07:33.487 --> 07:36.021
How was playa del carmen?
Incredible.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.123
Santos had to find a cursed
booby-trapped diamond

07:38.125 --> 07:41.960
In an underwater cave.
I had to kill four sharks.
Whoa. Oh.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.664
They were animatronic,
but still quite fierce.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.766
Here's a little
something for you.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.167
I saw it and I thought,

07:49.169 --> 07:52.637
"that's so jane."
that's...

07:52.639 --> 07:54.105
Oh, wow.

07:54.107 --> 07:57.809
That is striking.
Yeah.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.144
And heavy.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.245
Yes. Put it on.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.948
I will.
Yes. Alba.

08:05.184 --> 08:08.086
(speaks spanish)
xiomara...

08:13.693 --> 08:14.693
Jane:
Okay. Bye, guys.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.562
(gasps)
wow.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.130
Go, go, we'll
catch up later.
Uh-huh.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.632
Enjoy the necklace.
I will.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.601
Yes.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.537
Xiomara, I've been
eager to see you.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.539
Really?
Yes.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.908
We need to talk
about our vegas show.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.978
The stakes have been
raised, because...

08:32.980 --> 08:36.815
Mitchell murray
has agreed to direct.

08:36.817 --> 08:40.252
Mitchell murray?
The theater genius.

08:40.254 --> 08:41.920
He is directing
a broadway revival

08:41.922 --> 08:43.889
Of <i>jesus christ superstar.</i>

08:43.891 --> 08:47.292
I've always wanted
to play jesus.
I thought you hated plays.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.727
No, it's different.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.829
Cool people like bradley cooper
do broadway now.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.797
Anyway, this is my first step

08:52.799 --> 08:55.867
Towards achieving an egot.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.272
Once I secure my tony,

09:00.274 --> 09:03.575
All that remains is an ego.

09:07.079 --> 09:08.880
Xiomara, this is serious.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.749
We start rehearsals
immediately.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.751
Our act must be perfect.

09:12.753 --> 09:16.021
Perfectly paced,
perfectly timed.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.223
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And speaking</i>
<i>of perfectly timed,</i>

09:18.225 --> 09:21.927
<i>Jane was on her way</i>
<i>to talk to rafael, when...</i>

09:21.929 --> 09:23.929
<i>Oh, dear.</i>
<i>Jane.</i>

09:23.931 --> 09:25.063
Hi.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.198
Uh, we were just
on our way out.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.200
Um, some returns.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.869
You pushed my grandmother
down the stairs.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.571
You should be in jail.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.573
Ugh, enough already.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.808
Stop harassing me.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.618
Well that was
well-timed, hmm?

09:46.620 --> 09:48.219
Yeah, well rafael really
shouldn't leave his calendar

09:48.221 --> 09:50.288
Open on his computer
like that.

09:50.290 --> 09:54.192
Now jane'll be in a terrible
mood for their meeting.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.027
Anyway,

09:56.029 --> 09:58.363
These past two weeks with
rafael have been really good.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.864
We've been growing closer.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.967
Latin lover narrator:
<i>This is true, fyi.</i>

10:01.969 --> 10:04.336
Now I just need to make sure
jane doesn't get in my way.

10:04.338 --> 10:07.038
Hey, jane.
Hi.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.873
Uh, how are you?

10:08.875 --> 10:12.611
Look, I wanted
to talk to you.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.212
Uh, me, too.
Oh.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.047
Okay.
Yeah, I b... Mm.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.782
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Come on, solano, spit it out.</i>

10:17.784 --> 10:19.284
<i>Tell her how you feel.</i>

10:19.286 --> 10:23.254
I met with a lawyer and
I'm filing for primary custody.

10:23.256 --> 10:26.057
What?
That doesn't mean that you
won't see the baby-- you'll

10:26.059 --> 10:27.759
Get visitation.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.061
But it'll live with me.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.731
Wait, why?
Because I don't want
the baby around

10:32.733 --> 10:35.166
The hotel... Your sister,
petra, magda...

10:35.168 --> 10:36.735
But what about me?

10:36.737 --> 10:39.638
Look, I can't separate that.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.306
You have to!

10:41.308 --> 10:42.841
My sister hasn't been
in touch with sin rostro.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.010
And for the past two weeks,
she sat down

10:45.012 --> 10:46.645
With the police three times.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.647
You can check with...

10:48.649 --> 10:50.081
Michael.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.816
I will, but I just saw
petra with her mother,

10:51.818 --> 10:53.785
Right in the lobby.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.254
Well, then we'll ban
magda from the hotel.
You can't ban petra.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.289
You work with her.
I won't bring the baby here.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.425
You live here.
Then I'll get another apartment!

11:00.427 --> 11:02.360
I will!

11:02.362 --> 11:04.062
Jane, don't do this.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.398
Please, if this isn't about
keeping the baby away from me,

11:06.400 --> 11:08.133
Then don't.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.874
He offered to get an apartment?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.075
Wow, that's a pretty big deal.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.244
Hey, who's side are you on?

11:19.246 --> 11:20.679
Yours always!

11:20.681 --> 11:23.915
But... I let anger
get in the way

11:23.917 --> 11:25.316
When I was younger
with rogelio.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.318
Yeah, I know.
It's just...

11:27.320 --> 11:29.721
So hard not to be
angry with him.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.823
Plus, it doesn't help
that magda's walking around

11:31.825 --> 11:34.726
While we're here stuck paying
abuela's medical bills.

11:34.728 --> 11:35.960
Trust me, I get it.
It's killing me, too.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.162
(cell phone rings)

11:37.164 --> 11:38.363
Oh.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.898
It's michael. Good.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.199
Hey.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.967
So, yeah, I got your message.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.869
And, yes, luisa's been
cooperating with us.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.072
So far, it doesn't
look like she's been

11:47.074 --> 11:49.307
In contact with sin rostro.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.076
Okay, that's good, at least.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.343
Thanks for checking.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.445
Yeah, no problem.

11:55.347 --> 11:56.715
Michael?
Hey.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.917
Okay, there's
this thing tomorrow.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.885
What kind of thing?

12:00.887 --> 12:02.787
Uh, like a ceremony thing.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.789
I'm getting a commendation.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.224
Wow!

12:06.226 --> 12:08.126
Michael,
that's great!

12:08.128 --> 12:09.794
Yeah, thank you.
Yeah, it's not a...

12:09.796 --> 12:11.463
It's not a big deal
or anything, but, uh,

12:11.465 --> 12:13.131
I was...

12:13.133 --> 12:14.966
I'm supposed to bring someone.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.001
And I was wondering if...

12:17.003 --> 12:19.804
Maybe-- I don't know--
if you wanted to come.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.740
As a friend 'cause, you know,

12:21.742 --> 12:23.241
You were with me
when I first started.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.476
But if not, it's totally cool.

12:24.478 --> 12:26.778
I'd love to go. Yes.

12:26.780 --> 12:27.912
That's great.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.314
I will text you the details.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.381
Sounds good.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.250
Okay, bye.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.451
Where are you going
with michael?

12:33.453 --> 12:35.754
He's getting an award.
He asked me to go.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.756
As friends.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.257
He just said that on the phone.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.393
Knock, knock.

12:43.295 --> 12:44.796
Saw your
light was on.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.798
I figured you were
putting in a late night.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.200
Here.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.869
Double shot.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.470
Thank you.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.206
Sure.

12:56.175 --> 12:58.376
You okay?

12:59.345 --> 13:02.380
Eh, not great, honestly.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.382
Jane?

13:04.384 --> 13:06.851
Sorry. I don't
want to overstep.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.486
It's just I, uh...

13:08.488 --> 13:12.090
I saw her leaving earlier, and
she seemed pretty upset, too.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.092
Raf,

13:14.094 --> 13:16.094
I hope you know
you can talk to me.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.096
As a friend.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.331
Even if it's about jane.

13:23.435 --> 13:26.437
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes, jane...</i>

13:26.439 --> 13:30.275
<i>You'll recall</i>
<i>she had a novel to finish,</i>

13:30.277 --> 13:33.278
<i>And she was determined</i>
<i>to write.</i>

13:33.280 --> 13:35.280
<i>Even though</i>
<i>there were so many packages</i>

13:35.282 --> 13:39.417
<i>Just sitting there, unopened.</i>

13:39.419 --> 13:40.919
<i>Uh, sorry. Yes.</i>

13:40.921 --> 13:44.389
<i>She was on</i>
<i>a ten-page-a-day schedule.</i>

13:46.592 --> 13:49.961
<i>Oh, maybe just one.</i>

13:49.963 --> 13:51.930
<i>She'll just open one.</i>

13:51.932 --> 13:55.166
<i>Okay, that is definitely cute.</i>

13:55.168 --> 13:57.168
<i>I do love ducks.</i>

13:57.170 --> 14:00.572
<i>Now, back to writing.</i>

14:00.574 --> 14:02.540
<i>Jane? Come on.</i>

14:02.542 --> 14:04.609
<i>Time to write.</i>

14:06.378 --> 14:08.146
<i>Uh, okay, fine.</i>

14:08.148 --> 14:10.415
<i>As soon as you figure out</i>
<i>where the towels go.</i>

14:11.383 --> 14:13.218
<i>Quick update.</i>

14:13.220 --> 14:14.586
<i>It's been two hours.</i>

14:14.588 --> 14:16.354
<i>She won't stop organizing.</i>

14:16.356 --> 14:18.256
Jane?

14:19.925 --> 14:22.560
I just want to get a few things
ready before the baby comes.

14:23.495 --> 14:24.562
I know.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.431
But I can't stop. Seriously.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.434
I keep trying to and work,
but I can't.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.569
(chuckles)
what?

14:33.572 --> 14:34.973
Nesting?

14:41.413 --> 14:43.414
I don't have
time for nesting.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.284
Nesting is not in the calendar.
There is no color for nesting.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.455
I'm serious, abuela.

14:50.457 --> 14:53.191
I need to get pages.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.360
Look at
these teeny tiny booties.

14:56.662 --> 14:59.397
(singing "suspicious minds"
in spanish)

14:59.399 --> 15:00.632
That's right, rogelio.

15:11.644 --> 15:12.677
Now to the center.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.553
Okay, now we slow it down.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.688
Keep it sexy.

15:28.193 --> 15:29.560
And the lift rises.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.031
Stop!

15:33.033 --> 15:34.532
Turn off the music now!

15:34.534 --> 15:37.068
Why? What is it?
Mitchell murray

15:37.070 --> 15:38.503
Will laugh
at this choreography.

15:38.505 --> 15:39.671
It's not good enough.

15:39.673 --> 15:42.140
We have to do better!

15:44.677 --> 15:47.478
What was that
all about?

15:47.480 --> 15:48.613
You want to
know the truth?

15:48.615 --> 15:50.615
I could feel you out there.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.650
Desiring me.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.219
What?!
Yes, and it made me
uncomfortable.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.988
So I want you
to spend the afternoon

15:56.990 --> 15:58.323
Gaining control over that.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.191
Because we're just friends.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.660
Woman:
But something didn't sit right.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.997
And so detective cordero
continued to pursue his leads,

16:05.999 --> 16:07.632
And thanks
to his tireless efforts,

16:07.634 --> 16:12.437
We were able to apprehend 22
members of sin rostro's network.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.638
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

16:13.640 --> 16:15.640
<i>See, that's the rub,</i>
<i>right there.</i>

16:15.642 --> 16:17.342
<i>You'll recall...</i>
<i>Michael:</i>
<i>Your name was on the list.</i>

16:17.344 --> 16:18.676
Were you working for sin rostro?

16:21.413 --> 16:22.447
Yes.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.514
<i>But you have to understand</i>

16:23.516 --> 16:25.016
She-she was threatening to kill

16:25.018 --> 16:26.617
My family--
she knew where they lived.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.687
...With profound appreciation
for your service and bravery

16:29.689 --> 16:31.289
In the line of duty...

16:31.291 --> 16:34.025
A lot of names
on that list, though.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.661
Probably take me an
hour to find yours.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.530
<i>...We honor you, today,</i>

16:39.532 --> 16:43.201
With the distinguished
service medal.

16:43.203 --> 16:46.537
(applause)
thank you.

16:52.611 --> 16:54.545
Yay! Congratulations.
(chuckles)
thank you.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.048
Oh... (chuckles)

16:57.050 --> 16:59.117
Detective cordero, how 'bout
a picture of you and your date?

16:59.119 --> 17:01.285
Oh. We... She's not... Yeah.
Oh. I-I'm not his date.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.187
We're
just friends.
Yep. S... Um...

17:03.189 --> 17:04.655
Eh...
Okay. We'll take a photo.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.424
Thanks.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.259
All right. Sorry.
That was weird.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.428
Um, anyway,
thank you for coming.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.729
As a friend.
It means a lot.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.132
No, I'm glad I came.
That was amazing.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.733
You want to go for dinner,

17:15.735 --> 17:17.769
Or... You don't have to.

17:17.771 --> 17:20.071
No, I want to, but I have
my high school reunion tonight.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.140
Oh, right, right.
Yeah, I forgot.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.609
I have that in my planner.
You don't still have
that planner.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.378
No, no, I don't.
Anyway, have fun.
(chuckles)

17:27.380 --> 17:30.214
And... Stay away
from the mean girls.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.716
Oh, you know it.

17:31.718 --> 17:32.750
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

17:32.752 --> 17:35.219
That was easier said than done.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.222
<i>In fact, jane was about to run</i>
<i>into her first mean girl</i>

17:38.224 --> 17:40.625
<i>Before she even got</i>
<i>to the reunion.</i>

17:40.627 --> 17:43.561
Petra:
Jane...

17:43.563 --> 17:45.630
Can we talk?

17:52.671 --> 17:54.439
Look, I know
we have our differences.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.675
But, please,
don't take it out on rafael.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.077
What are you talking about?

17:59.079 --> 18:01.079
He's miserable, jane.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.714
So I just... I wanted
to make sure that you know

18:03.716 --> 18:06.150
That I would never,
ever harm your child.

18:06.152 --> 18:08.686
I hope you know that's true.
I never would.

18:08.688 --> 18:12.690
It's funny.
I'd like to trust you.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.358
But I did that once, remember?

18:14.360 --> 18:16.727
And then you...

18:16.729 --> 18:20.865
Turned back into a huge bitch
again, basically.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.802
Look, I-it...

18:24.804 --> 18:26.804
It was hard...

18:26.806 --> 18:29.373
To watch
you and rafael together.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.375
I mean... Look,
you need to understand,

18:31.377 --> 18:32.710
We were...
We were in love.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.712
We were trying to have a baby.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.115
And then... All of a sudden,

18:37.117 --> 18:39.750
He had all of that.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.753
With you.

18:42.755 --> 18:46.524
Look, I'm-I'm coming
to you now with...

18:46.526 --> 18:48.192
No ulterior motive.

18:48.194 --> 18:49.794
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Except that she was trying</i>

18:49.796 --> 18:51.796
<i>To look like the bigger person</i>
<i>with rafael.</i>

18:51.798 --> 18:53.564
And I just need for you to know

18:53.566 --> 18:56.134
That I would never, ever hurt
your child.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.569
Okay?

18:58.571 --> 19:01.839
Don't punish rafael
for my mistakes.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.909
Lina:
Jane?

19:04.911 --> 19:06.177
You ready?

19:06.179 --> 19:08.179
I have to go.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.517
Okay, you need a new necklace.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.318
This says,
"I'd rather be home in bed."

19:14.320 --> 19:15.720
Really? It's the necklace?
Yeah. Yeah.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.722
It's not
the gigantic pregnant belly?

19:17.724 --> 19:19.657
Mm-mm. Definitely
the necklace.
Mm-mm?

19:19.659 --> 19:20.825
(chuckles)
here.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.694
Wear this.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.463
Straight from "tar-jay."

19:25.465 --> 19:26.831
It's perfect.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.332
And get pumped.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.800
This is gonna be fun.
Right.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.669
Yeah.
Yes, and I need some fun.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.504
Yes, girl!
Yes!

19:33.506 --> 19:37.942
<i>Give jane an a+ for effort.</i>

19:37.944 --> 19:40.511
<i>She was determined</i>
<i>to have a good time tonight.</i>

19:40.513 --> 19:42.914
<i>As she headed</i>
<i>into her high school reunion,</i>

19:42.916 --> 19:45.850
She reminded herself she wasn't
<i>an unemployed pregnant lady.</i>

19:45.852 --> 19:48.853
<i>She was</i>
<i>an unemployed pregnant writer.</i>

19:48.855 --> 19:50.888
Most likely to succeed?

19:50.890 --> 19:52.823
Not so much.

19:56.328 --> 19:58.563
Okay. Let's go.
Uh-huh.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.866
Don't worry. I'm not where
I thought I'd be either.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.872
Have I made it onto
<i>the bachelor</i> yet? No.

20:07.874 --> 20:11.809
Have I auditioned
three times? Four. Yes.

20:18.250 --> 20:19.750
Wow.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.252
I guess
she really did drop instagram

20:21.254 --> 20:23.888
As part
of a social media cleanse.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.523
It'll be fine.
(chuckles)

20:25.525 --> 20:27.425
I see mr. Baird.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.859
Okay.

20:28.861 --> 20:32.263
And I actually decided
to turn down a teaching job

20:32.265 --> 20:33.998
Because I'm writing a novel.
Really?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.866
Just trying to finish
before the baby comes.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.868
You know, I-I
have a schedule.
Well, how far along are you?

20:37.870 --> 20:40.871
Oh, only halfway through.
But if I do ten pages a day...

20:40.873 --> 20:42.273
I-I meant in your pregnancy.

20:42.275 --> 20:45.243
Oh!
That's nice
to know, too.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.411
Maybe get the baby news out
of the way first next time.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.413
So, I'm having a baby.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.748
I can see that.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.583
Is there a... Dad?

20:52.585 --> 20:53.985
Yes. There is one.

20:53.987 --> 20:55.653
But we're not together.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.255
But it's for the best.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.389
I mean,
at the end of the day,

20:58.391 --> 20:59.457
We were just so different,

20:59.459 --> 21:00.458
So now, I'm just,

21:00.460 --> 21:01.626
Like, really happy.

21:01.628 --> 21:02.960
I'm incredibly happy.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.895
Tmi, jane! Tmi!

21:04.897 --> 21:06.998
Try asking <i>them</i> questions.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.700
You're engaged?
Want to come to my
bachelorette party in June?

21:09.702 --> 21:12.370
(sing-songy):
We're renting a houseboat
off of st. Thomas.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.705
I'd love to, but...
I'm giving birth.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.540
(sing-songy):
At st. Luke's.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.808
Abort! Abort!

21:17.810 --> 21:20.011
The situation, I mean.
Get out!

21:20.013 --> 21:24.282
Hey, anyone sitting at
this empty table with you?

21:29.021 --> 21:30.755
It's jane, right?

21:30.757 --> 21:32.556
He knows our name!

21:32.558 --> 21:34.492
Yeah.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.961
So... How
have you been?

21:36.963 --> 21:39.730
As successful as everyone else
I've talked to tonight?

21:39.732 --> 21:40.998
(laughs)

21:41.000 --> 21:42.933
No, actually.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.368
Not at all.

21:44.370 --> 21:47.038
I live at home,
and I'm currently unemployed

21:47.040 --> 21:48.839
Because I'm trying
to become a writer.

21:48.841 --> 21:51.876
Wow. It's a ballsy move.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.745
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Just to be clear, jane wasn't</i>
<i>looking for a new boyfriend.</i>

21:54.747 --> 21:56.614
<i>But still, it was nice</i>
<i>to talk to someone</i>

21:56.616 --> 21:57.915
<i>Who wasn't focused</i>
<i>on her pregnancy.</i>

21:57.917 --> 22:00.384
You hungry?

22:00.386 --> 22:01.919
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Constantly!</i>

22:01.921 --> 22:03.587
Definitely.
Cool, let's
get some food.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.489
Oh. Wow.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.758
You're pregnant.
I-I'm sorry. I...
It's okay.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.994
No, I-I didn't know.
It's fine. I-I...
I'm single, though.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.330
Oh, no, no, no, I'm not
really looking for...
No, no, I wasn't

22:12.332 --> 22:14.598
Saying it
because I...
Whoa, whoa.
I'm really sorry.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.468
I-I had... No idea.

22:17.470 --> 22:20.004
Xiomara:
<i>I'm telling you,</i>
<i>he ran out of there.</i>

22:20.006 --> 22:23.474
The rehearsal was going great,
and then he had this, like,

22:23.476 --> 22:26.544
Prima donna meltdown, and said
that I was hitting on him.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.114
No! Geez!

22:30.116 --> 22:31.816
I was getting into position

22:31.818 --> 22:33.517
So that we could be lifted up
into the air.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.588
It's this hydraulic lift
that the director requested.

22:52.471 --> 22:53.838
Xiomara:
<i>You think</i>

22:53.840 --> 22:56.073
He's afraid of heights?

22:59.845 --> 23:02.646
But he doesn't mind giant
staircases for grand entrances.

23:09.955 --> 23:12.156
So how did inez get over it?

23:15.660 --> 23:17.128
Mm-hmm.

23:23.502 --> 23:26.404
Mm-hmm.

23:26.406 --> 23:29.507
(sighs)
latin lover narrator:
And speaking of sad stories...

23:29.509 --> 23:31.909
The last time
I addressed you,

23:31.911 --> 23:34.078
At our graduation,
we were all wondering

23:34.080 --> 23:35.780
Where the future would take us.

23:35.782 --> 23:38.849
I'm sure we had a sense
of where we'd like to be.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.018
I know I did. (laughs)

23:41.020 --> 23:44.688
But things didn't exactly turn
out like I thought they would.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.690
I mean, at all. (laughs)

23:46.692 --> 23:48.993
Honestly, they couldn't be
farther from what I imagined.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.494
You know what's
funny, though?

23:50.496 --> 23:52.129
I was scared
to come here tonight,

23:52.131 --> 23:54.064
Because I thought
you'd all judge me,

23:54.066 --> 23:57.802
And think I was unaccomplished.

23:57.804 --> 24:00.137
But that didn't happen
at all. In fact,

24:00.139 --> 24:02.773
None of you cared,
because I'm pregnant.

24:02.775 --> 24:06.043
So, when you look at me, that's
all you see-- a pregnant lady.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.612
And, look. Stop! Look!

24:08.614 --> 24:11.081
I get it. I know that "mom"
is the most important job

24:11.083 --> 24:12.783
In the world,
and not just because

24:12.785 --> 24:14.952
So many of you have told me that
tonight.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.755
The thing is, is I don't
want to be just a mom.

24:17.757 --> 24:20.090
I want a career. I want

24:20.092 --> 24:21.525
A life!

24:21.527 --> 24:24.762
I want to be seen
as a person in my own...

24:24.764 --> 24:26.530
Ow!

24:26.532 --> 24:28.232
The baby's coming!

24:28.234 --> 24:30.634
Get off this stage before your
water breaks and I'm humiliated!

24:30.636 --> 24:32.036
Ow!  <i>Ow!</i>

24:32.038 --> 24:33.938
This can't be happening!

24:33.940 --> 24:37.041
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Thankfully, it wasn't.</i>

24:37.043 --> 24:40.711
The last time I addressed you,
at our graduation,

24:40.713 --> 24:43.647
We were all wondering
where the future would take us.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.583
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You know the drill.</i>
<i>Jane told everyone</i>

24:45.585 --> 24:47.117
<i>That life is what happens</i>
<i>when you're busy</i>

24:47.119 --> 24:48.953
<i>Making plans, yada yada.</i>

24:48.955 --> 24:51.088
<i>And that the real joy lies</i>
<i>in the unexpected.</i>

24:51.090 --> 24:53.224
<i>It was a short, lovely speech.</i>

24:53.226 --> 24:54.792
Go class of 2010!

24:54.794 --> 24:57.628
(applause and cheering)

24:57.630 --> 25:00.130
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And unfortunately, jane wasn't</i>
<i>feeling a word of it.</i>

25:04.236 --> 25:07.705
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Luckily, with the speech over,</i>
<i>home was within jane's grasp.</i>

25:07.707 --> 25:09.139
Hey, jane.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.741
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ugh, so close.</i>

25:11.910 --> 25:14.745
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oops.</i>

25:14.747 --> 25:16.680
Latin lover narrator:
<i>No, I meant it.</i>

25:16.682 --> 25:18.749
Hi, stephanie.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.084
Look at you!

25:20.086 --> 25:22.753
When are you due?
Oh. Four more weeks.

25:22.755 --> 25:26.156
Wow. I would have thought
you'd say, like, tomorrow.

25:26.158 --> 25:27.858
Oh. No.

25:27.860 --> 25:28.993
'cause you're so big!

25:28.995 --> 25:30.694
Yeah, I got it.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.696
Pull her hair! Shiv her!

25:32.698 --> 25:34.164
Take care.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.600
Wait. Jane.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.702
I just wanted to apologize.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.804
I was kind of harsh on you

25:40.806 --> 25:43.207
In high school,
and it wasn't cool, so,

25:43.209 --> 25:45.109
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.711
Oh.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.046
Thanks for saying that.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.814
And I get it.

25:50.816 --> 25:53.284
It was kind of weird
that my mom dated your dad.

25:53.286 --> 25:55.085
That's what you think
it was about?

25:55.087 --> 25:56.954
Well, yeah.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.622
You spread a rumor
around the school

25:58.624 --> 25:59.924
Saying that my mom was a slut,

25:59.926 --> 26:01.592
Which, for the record,
she's not.

26:01.594 --> 26:03.160
Oh.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.029
Yeah, I didn't care
about your mom.

26:05.031 --> 26:07.031
It was all about vince dibacco.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.666
What?!
Remember?

26:08.668 --> 26:10.768
The guy that asked you
to junior prom,

26:10.770 --> 26:13.637
And then changed
his mind the next day?
Yeah, I remember.

26:13.639 --> 26:15.806
I liked him, but vince's mom
was super religious,

26:15.808 --> 26:18.576
So I spread the rumor
about your mom, because I knew

26:18.578 --> 26:21.312
It'd get back to vince's sister,
who was a huge gossip.

26:21.314 --> 26:24.114
And it did, and she told
her mom, and her mom freaked,

26:24.116 --> 26:26.216
And then, he wasn't allowed
to go with you.

26:26.218 --> 26:28.085
And then he asked me.

26:29.287 --> 26:31.689
Wow.

26:31.691 --> 26:35.893
That's...
Incredibly complicated.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.828
It's a pretty basic technique--

26:37.830 --> 26:40.297
Use people's
vulnerabilities against them.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.967
Your mom was your vulnerability.

26:42.969 --> 26:46.170
Latin lover narrator:
For the first time in her life,

26:46.172 --> 26:50.374
<i>Jane found herself</i>
<i>inside the mind of a mean girl.</i>

26:50.376 --> 26:52.843
Sometimes you just
have to play dirty.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.778
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And just like that,</i>

26:54.780 --> 26:56.680
<i>Jane did learn</i>
<i>something that night.</i>

26:56.682 --> 27:00.684
<i>And she did always love</i>
<i>to learn, you'll recall.</i>

27:00.686 --> 27:02.886
Mr. Baird:
Jane.

27:02.888 --> 27:05.389
Such great work... Again.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.790
Thank you.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.792
I had fun writing it, so...

27:08.794 --> 27:10.728
You are such a weirdo.

27:14.065 --> 27:16.667
Jane?
Sorry.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.303
I was just remembering
the fun part of high school.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.338
Class?

27:21.340 --> 27:23.273
You are such a weirdo.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.075
Rogelio:
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

27:25.077 --> 27:26.977
You're afraid
of heights.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.780
That's just crazy talk!

27:29.782 --> 27:32.750
I'm not afraid of anything...
Except acne and leprechauns.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.284
Leprechauns
aren't real.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.853
I know what I saw!

27:35.855 --> 27:38.722
And regardless,
I don't mind heights.

27:38.724 --> 27:42.026
I descend grand staircases
frequently.

27:42.028 --> 27:44.161
Well, how about if
there were no stairs?

27:44.163 --> 27:47.831
Let's say, hypothetically,
we go to the grand canyon,

27:47.833 --> 27:49.933
And I take you right
up to the edge?

27:49.935 --> 27:51.869
You can see over.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.438
There's nothing below,
just a sharp drop...

27:54.440 --> 27:55.839
Stop!

27:55.841 --> 27:57.741
Okay. Okay, it's true,

27:57.743 --> 27:59.443
But I don't want anyone to know.

27:59.445 --> 28:02.012
How can I expect mitchell
to see me as jesus christ,

28:02.014 --> 28:05.916
Aka the holy messiah, if I can't
even manage a hydraulic lift?

28:05.918 --> 28:08.919
I am sure he'll understand.
No, he won't.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.288
And I don't want to get a
reputation of being difficult.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.023
Again.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.226
Okay, there's got to be some
way to get you over this.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.929
I've tried everything, xiomara,

28:18.931 --> 28:20.864
But nothing's working.

28:22.467 --> 28:25.969
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And speaking of not working,</i>

28:25.971 --> 28:28.939
<i>Jane was determined to turn</i>
<i>things around with her novel.</i>

28:28.941 --> 28:31.375
<i>She had her plan, remember?</i>
<i>Her calendar.</i>

28:31.377 --> 28:33.877
<i>And she really had to get...</i>

28:33.879 --> 28:37.715
<i>Diapers and wipes</i>
<i>and a wipe warmer.</i>

28:47.759 --> 28:49.026
(sighs)

28:55.166 --> 28:57.234
Oh, yes.

29:07.946 --> 29:10.247
â™ª

29:30.268 --> 29:32.936
â™ª

29:42.447 --> 29:45.249
...And I'm in this weird
in-between state.

29:45.251 --> 29:47.384
Totally scared of raising a kid,

29:47.386 --> 29:50.087
And so badly wanting
to do it right,

29:50.089 --> 29:52.890
But also, not wanting it
to take over my whole life.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.291
Michael:
It won't.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.926
You won't let it.

29:55.928 --> 29:57.828
It could. I mean,

29:57.830 --> 29:59.897
I have this schedule,
to finish my novel,

29:59.899 --> 30:01.799
And I'm already so behind.

30:01.801 --> 30:04.067
That's because
it's a crazy schedule.

30:04.069 --> 30:05.469
What?

30:05.471 --> 30:07.104
I'm sorry, it is.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.473
Look, you-you decided
you wanted to be a writer, what,

30:09.475 --> 30:10.974
Like, six months ago?

30:10.976 --> 30:12.810
So give yourself time
to get there.

30:14.279 --> 30:17.414
You like plans,
so make a new plan.

30:17.416 --> 30:21.051
A real one.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.953
So, you give good career advice.

30:22.955 --> 30:26.023
No wonder
you got a commendation.

30:26.991 --> 30:29.126
Michael?

30:29.128 --> 30:31.461
Yeah. Sorry.

30:31.463 --> 30:32.963
(sighs)

30:32.965 --> 30:35.299
It's just complicated.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.935
What is?
Michael: Work.

30:37.937 --> 30:42.072
I did something...
Believed someone.

30:42.074 --> 30:45.409
I'm just not sure
if I made the right call.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.044
I bet you did.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.278
Hmm?

30:48.280 --> 30:51.114
I bet you did the right thing.

30:51.116 --> 30:54.218
Thanks.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.356
You there?

30:59.358 --> 31:01.992
Yeah.

31:01.994 --> 31:03.927
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>

31:03.929 --> 31:06.096
<i>That they were both thinking</i>
<i>the exact same thing--</i>

31:06.098 --> 31:09.032
<i>That it felt like old times.</i>

31:11.903 --> 31:14.972
So listen,
I should go and get some sleep.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.540
Gotcha.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.542
Good night, jane.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.111
Good night.

31:21.113 --> 31:23.413
(sighs)

31:30.655 --> 31:32.456
Are you ready?

31:32.458 --> 31:35.092
What's the big decision?

31:35.094 --> 31:39.329
I want to apply to a graduate
program for writing.

31:39.331 --> 31:42.165
Well, if I'm serious about
writing a book-- which I am--

31:42.167 --> 31:43.567
I need to give myself
realistic goals.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.235
Plus, I-I-I...

31:45.237 --> 31:46.436
I like being in school,
and I'm...

31:46.438 --> 31:48.972
I think that's a great idea.

31:48.974 --> 31:52.009
It'll help keep you sane, too,
with the whole mommy thing.
Exactly.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.211
I'll know that I'm working
towards something for me.

31:56.314 --> 31:57.547
Great.

32:00.418 --> 32:03.186
Michael, actually.

32:03.188 --> 32:04.354
You know, we were
talking last night.

32:04.356 --> 32:06.290
As friends.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.659
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Yeah, keep telling</i>
<i>yourself that.</i>

32:10.395 --> 32:13.463
Anyway, I should go to
my doctor's appointment.

32:16.701 --> 32:18.602
How's everything
looking down there?

32:18.604 --> 32:21.305
Great. The baby's about
five and a half pounds,

32:21.307 --> 32:23.073
And you're about
ten percent effaced.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.374
Effaced?
As the baby's

32:24.376 --> 32:26.076
Head drops into the pelvis,

32:26.078 --> 32:28.078
The cervix becomes
longer and thinner

32:28.080 --> 32:29.246
To get ready for birth.

32:29.248 --> 32:30.614
Wait, so she's close?

32:30.616 --> 32:32.349
How close?

32:32.351 --> 32:34.318
Since there are no
other signs of labor,

32:34.320 --> 32:36.420
I'd say you're still on track
for your due date.

32:36.422 --> 32:39.056
My due date.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.291
Oh, okay. Good.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.393
Um, is there any chance
the baby will come

32:43.395 --> 32:45.395
In the next three days?

32:45.397 --> 32:47.297
Supposed to take
a quick work trip.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.533
There's always a chance. Babies
come on their own schedule.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.001
But it's not likely.

32:51.003 --> 32:52.602
Right. Uh, perce... Percentage?

32:52.604 --> 32:54.338
Less than five percent.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.440
Thank you.

32:56.442 --> 32:59.409
Uh, it's-it's just
a quick trip. It's...

32:59.411 --> 33:00.711
It'll be fine.

33:00.713 --> 33:04.314
But I did want to talk to you,
about custody.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.383
I've thought
a lot about it.

33:06.385 --> 33:09.186
And I think the platform should
go a couple feet higher,

33:09.188 --> 33:11.188
So we can really
reach the cheap seats.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.622
Throw those
folks a bone.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.391
On the other hand,

33:14.393 --> 33:16.526
Maybe we should
punish them a little bit

33:16.528 --> 33:19.363
For not being able to afford
the good seats. (chuckles)

33:19.365 --> 33:21.431
(laughs)

33:30.408 --> 33:32.409
This guy cracks me up.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.478
Now get up there,
let me take a look.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.546
Okay.

33:41.386 --> 33:42.352
Are you okay?

33:42.354 --> 33:44.354
Incredible.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.223
Don't worry-- they
wouldn't have us do this

33:46.225 --> 33:48.291
If it weren't safe.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.765
(breathing faster)

33:56.601 --> 33:59.236
Stop!

33:59.238 --> 34:02.139
I'm sorry, mr. Murray,
but I just can't do this.

34:02.141 --> 34:03.507
The truth is...

34:03.509 --> 34:05.742
I'm terrified
of heights.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.778
What?

34:07.780 --> 34:10.480
I'm sorry, but I am, so...

34:10.482 --> 34:12.482
This whole platform thing,
it's just not gonna work.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.352
It's not going to work?

34:15.354 --> 34:16.820
Not going to work?

34:16.822 --> 34:18.488
I'll tell you
what won't work.

34:18.490 --> 34:21.825
You.
At least not with me again.

34:21.827 --> 34:24.828
Oh...
I have to rethink this.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.229
Everybody take ten.

34:26.231 --> 34:27.364
And for the love of god,

34:27.366 --> 34:28.598
Get this thing down.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.601
Can't you see she's scared?

34:34.806 --> 34:36.206
Thank you.

34:36.208 --> 34:39.276
Hey, that's what
friends are for.

34:40.678 --> 34:43.080
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Huh. Maybe exes can be friends</i>

34:43.082 --> 34:44.448
<i>After all.</i>

34:46.484 --> 34:48.552
<i>And speaking of...</i>
<i>(soft knocking)</i>

34:48.554 --> 34:50.620
Hey.
Hey.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.458
Um...

34:54.460 --> 34:56.726
I just wanted to thank you

34:56.728 --> 34:58.728
For talking to jane.

34:58.730 --> 35:02.499
She said that she doesn't think
you're a threat to our baby.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.734
Really?

35:04.736 --> 35:06.403
Well, good. I'm so glad.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.572
Yeah.

35:08.574 --> 35:11.575
Except she hasn't changed
her mind about the whole...

35:11.577 --> 35:14.244
Custody thing.
What?

35:14.246 --> 35:16.413
Yeah, she's being
completely unreasonable,

35:16.415 --> 35:18.515
Saying that as long as your
mother's walking around,

35:18.517 --> 35:20.350
She won't change her mind.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.419
But...
Like I said-- doesn't
make any sense.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.588
Now I have to get
a lawyer and...

35:24.590 --> 35:27.290
It'll get ugly.

35:27.292 --> 35:30.894
Oh, god, I'm...

35:30.896 --> 35:33.897
Raf, I am so sorry.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.599
I feel terrible.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.767
No, hey, come on...
It's not your fault.

35:37.769 --> 35:40.470
You have been incredible,

35:40.472 --> 35:42.506
Actually.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.908
I just...

35:44.910 --> 35:47.744
It means a lot to me
that you tried to help.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.349
It means more
than you know.

35:55.453 --> 35:58.455
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Uh-oh. Looks like jane's</i>
<i>not the only one</i>

35:58.457 --> 36:00.824
<i>Guilty of leaning</i>
<i>on someone familiar.</i>

36:02.593 --> 36:04.494
I'm sorry, I can't.

36:05.930 --> 36:09.666
Maybe if all this baby drama
weren't going on, but...

36:11.302 --> 36:12.602
I'm sorry.

36:12.604 --> 36:15.405
Hey, no.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.774
There's nothing
to be sorry for.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.509
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Wow.</i>

36:19.511 --> 36:21.778
<i>Looks like petra</i>
<i>does have a heart after all.</i>

36:21.780 --> 36:22.779
Petra:
<i>Mother,</i>

36:22.781 --> 36:24.481
Do you remember how you said

36:24.483 --> 36:25.649
You'd do anything for me?

36:27.518 --> 36:28.852
Yes, of course.

36:28.854 --> 36:32.522
Well... Here's what I want.

36:34.225 --> 36:35.959
You're going to call
detective cordero

36:35.961 --> 36:37.961
And you're going to tell him
that, while I was showering,

36:37.963 --> 36:40.463
The night of the palomas,
you ran after alba

36:40.465 --> 36:42.265
And pushed her down the stairs.

36:42.267 --> 36:45.702
What?
You going to tell them
that I had no idea,

36:45.704 --> 36:47.604
And that when you
told me the truth,

36:47.606 --> 36:49.406
I forced you to confess.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.641
Petra, are you insane?

36:51.643 --> 36:52.809
I'll be the hero.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.945
Jane will drop
her custody play.

36:54.947 --> 36:57.547
Mother, I am so close
to getting him back.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.349
You know
that's all I want.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.750
But what about me?

37:00.752 --> 37:02.319
I'll be in prison.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.954
You'll strike some sort of plea.

37:03.956 --> 37:06.223
Felony battery.
Likely a two-year sentence,

37:06.225 --> 37:07.724
And you'll be out
in less than that.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.526
Afterwards,
I'll take care of you.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.361
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And I'm starting to rethink</i>

37:11.363 --> 37:12.696
<i>That whole</i>
<i>"petra's got a heart" thing.</i>

37:12.698 --> 37:14.397
You owe me, mother.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.967
Now, do you want to call
detective cordero,

37:16.969 --> 37:19.236
Or should I?

37:24.442 --> 37:27.844
It worked.
They arrested her. Oh!

37:27.846 --> 37:30.447
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Confused? Let me explain.</i>

37:30.449 --> 37:33.883
<i>You remember this, right?</i>
<i>But I did want to talk</i>
<i>to you about custody.</i>

37:33.885 --> 37:36.820
I've thought a lot about it.
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But what you don't remember--</i>

37:36.822 --> 37:39.456
<i>Probably because</i>
<i>you never saw it-- is this:</i>

37:39.458 --> 37:41.524
And I don't want
to keep the baby from you.

37:41.526 --> 37:44.027
I know you'll be a good father.

37:44.029 --> 37:46.796
You were right--
I need to separate things.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.632
And michael said that
your sister checks out,

37:48.634 --> 37:53.303
And I don't think that petra
would really hurt the baby.

37:53.305 --> 37:55.472
Thank you, jane.
But wait.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.040
I still want her
mother in jail.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.541
And I think I know
how we can do it.

37:58.543 --> 38:00.010
It's a pretty basic technique.

38:00.012 --> 38:02.712
You use people's vulnerabilities
against them.

38:02.714 --> 38:03.980
You're petra's
vulnerability,

38:03.982 --> 38:07.050
Wait, she's not, though.
Trust me. She is.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.319
Sometimes you just
have to play dirty.

38:09.321 --> 38:10.587
And I think that
she'd do anything,

38:10.589 --> 38:11.988
Even turn in her own mother,

38:11.990 --> 38:13.590
If she thought
she had a chance with you.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.558
Latin lover narrator:
<i>See? There's a reason</i>

38:15.560 --> 38:17.827
<i>Jane was valedictorian.</i>

38:19.730 --> 38:21.498
Oh... (laughs)

38:21.500 --> 38:22.632
Thank you.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.001
No. Thank you.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.304
And-and I feel like
I should apologize

38:27.306 --> 38:29.039
For letting things get ugly.

38:29.041 --> 38:31.441
No. You were worried
for the baby.

38:31.443 --> 38:35.345
Yeah. That and...

38:35.347 --> 38:37.314
I was mad, honestly.

38:37.316 --> 38:38.648
After you ended it.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.651
Jane...
But I get it now.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.053
And you were right.

38:43.055 --> 38:45.055
It wouldn't have worked
in the long run.

38:45.057 --> 38:47.691
And that was hard
for me to accept,

38:47.693 --> 38:49.459
Because of how much
you hurt me.

38:49.461 --> 38:51.961
But I feel like
I'm on the other side.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.963
Finally.

38:53.965 --> 38:56.533
And I really do
want us to be friends.

38:56.535 --> 39:00.503
Great.

39:00.505 --> 39:04.374
Me, too.
Cool. So have a good trip.

39:04.376 --> 39:06.743
To justice
being served.
Yes.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.445
Mm-hmm.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.513
Mmm. Ah.

39:11.949 --> 39:13.950
(doorbell rings,
soft knocking on door)

39:13.952 --> 39:15.352
Oh, I got it.

39:16.420 --> 39:17.787
Hey.
Hi.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.389
I thought you might
like to celebrate.

39:19.391 --> 39:21.024
Looks like you
got that covered.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.593
No, come on in. You can never
have too much sparkling cider.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.462
Luisa:
<i>What's going on?</i>

39:25.464 --> 39:26.529
I am not going to Spain.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.131
If there is even
a small chance

39:28.133 --> 39:29.532
That she can go
into labor...

39:29.534 --> 39:31.534
What about the company?
I don't know.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.470
I'm guessing the board'll
vote to sell.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.638
But I have to let it go.

39:35.640 --> 39:39.576
I can't risk missing the
baby, it's not worth it.

39:39.578 --> 39:42.445
And I don't want
to be like our father.

39:42.447 --> 39:44.814
Luisa, this is my chance
to make a different choice.

39:44.816 --> 39:48.118
Yeah, I... I think
it's the right choice.

39:48.120 --> 39:50.420
Now what about jane?

39:50.422 --> 39:52.789
Well, what about jane?

39:52.791 --> 39:54.457
Call her.

39:54.459 --> 39:55.925
Tell her that you just
made a mistake

39:55.927 --> 39:57.494
And that you still love her.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.729
It is not
that easy.
Dude...

39:59.731 --> 40:02.665
Just do it. Now.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.434
Luisa:
Come on.

40:04.436 --> 40:07.137
Things can change
in a moment.

40:23.687 --> 40:26.556
(phone buzzing)

40:39.837 --> 40:41.104
So, can I ask you
a question?

40:41.106 --> 40:43.873
Of course.
Are you really okay...

40:43.875 --> 40:45.175
With us being friends?

40:45.177 --> 40:47.510
Because, last night...

40:47.512 --> 40:49.479
Kind of felt
like old times, yeah.

40:51.215 --> 40:53.950
Okay... Look,

40:53.952 --> 40:56.052
I'm not gonna lie.

40:56.054 --> 40:59.122
In a perfect world,
I'd want more.

40:59.124 --> 41:02.158
But the world's
not perfect.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.794
And the most important thing is

41:04.796 --> 41:06.563
That I want you in my life.

41:06.565 --> 41:09.933
And you said friends,
so I'm good with that.

41:09.935 --> 41:13.036
That's still
all you want, right?

41:13.038 --> 41:15.505
Yes. Definitely.

41:15.507 --> 41:18.508

41:18.510 --> 41:19.976
Cool.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.945
Latin lover narrator:
<i>...Over and over...</i>

41:21.947 --> 41:24.080
All right, I should head home.

41:24.082 --> 41:27.083
Uh, I'll talk to you later?

41:27.085 --> 41:29.118
Sounds good.
Thanks again.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.720
Cool.

41:30.722 --> 41:31.721
Bye.

41:31.723 --> 41:32.789
(no voice)

41:38.128 --> 41:40.196
Latin lover narrator:
<i>...And over.</i>
