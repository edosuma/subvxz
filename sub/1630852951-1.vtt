28:27.707 --> 28:29.668

28:29.709 --> 28:31.294
In fact...

28:33.463 --> 28:35.340
[switch clicks]

28:35.382 --> 28:37.801
Did you know
that Trumpet Tooter's ship

28:37.842 --> 28:40.845
was once spotted
in Coddington Bay?

28:40.887 --> 28:42.472
[gasping] You mean

28:42.514 --> 28:44.557
Trumpet-Tooter is real?

28:44.599 --> 28:46.017
[chatters]

28:46.059 --> 28:47.727
He is!

28:47.769 --> 28:49.521
And so is his ship.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.356
The Shiny Cutlass!

28:51.398 --> 28:53.525
[gasping]

28:53.566 --> 28:54.901
Legend has it that

28:54.943 --> 28:56.903
pirates stole
the Shiny Cutlass

28:56.945 --> 29:00.323
and then strayed off course
to Coddington...

29:00.365 --> 29:02.325
[chatters]

29:04.536 --> 29:06.788
They say a whale startled

29:06.830 --> 29:09.040
one of the thieving pirates

29:09.082 --> 29:10.417
and it caused him to drop

29:10.458 --> 29:12.377
Trumpet-Tooter's spyglass,

29:12.419 --> 29:15.046
somewhere in the Bay.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.923
[chatters]

29:16.965 --> 29:19.634
Has anyone tried
to look for it?

29:19.676 --> 29:22.220
The story's probably
just a legend.

29:22.262 --> 29:24.389
But it's fun
to think of Trumpet Tooter's

29:24.431 --> 29:26.516
famous ship right here

29:26.558 --> 29:29.227
in Coddington.

29:29.269 --> 29:32.564
It had an extraordinary
figurehead!

29:32.605 --> 29:34.399
A Hippocampus.

29:34.441 --> 29:36.735
Half-horse, half-fish.

29:36.776 --> 29:40.071
Trumpet-Tooter had it
on all his belongings.

30:07.098 --> 30:08.725
Do you still sell those codfish

30:08.767 --> 30:10.310
snow globes in the gift shop?

30:11.311 --> 30:13.688
Right this way.

30:13.730 --> 30:17.108
Hey, have you thought of
updating some of your exhibits?

30:17.150 --> 30:19.819
Think I'm stuck
in my ways, do you?

32:39.876 --> 32:41.002
Follow me to my office

out the damages.

for Trumpet Tooter's spyglass?

[laughs]

38:02.991 --> 38:05.076
If it is,

38:05.118 --> 38:08.913
then maybe the spyglass itself

38:08.955 --> 38:11.875
is still somewhere in the Bay!

38:52.832 --> 38:54.000

38:54.042 --> 38:56.961
Well, that's a tracking device.

38:58.421 --> 39:00.632
where the seal goes.

Cow?

Wildlife Institute."

39:33.206 --> 39:35.542

So you're an octopus

40:17.917 --> 40:19.711
and head scientist?

40:19.753 --> 40:23.048
Well, we're short staffed,

40:23.089 --> 40:25.008

of shoes to fill.

40:26.343 --> 40:28.136

40:30.930 --> 40:32.182
Uh, so, Emma,

40:32.223 --> 40:34.225
George found a seal

40:34.267 --> 40:36.353

[chatters]

40:50.450 --> 40:52.494
He did.

40:52.535 --> 40:54.245
Every time I visit the seals,

40:54.287 --> 40:56.373
I ring the bell
to call them over.

40:56.414 --> 40:58.458
So now the seals ring the bell

40:58.500 --> 41:00.418
when they want me.

41:00.460 --> 41:03.129
[chatters]

41:04.130 --> 41:05.757

42:05.608 --> 42:08.319
Oh, [chuckles] he sure does!

42:08.361 --> 42:10.405
And he found a seal pup.

42:10.447 --> 42:11.614
I think it's wearing

one of your tracking devices.

42:13.700 --> 42:16.995
Wait, it was a seal pup?

42:17.037 --> 42:18.496
A young seal?

42:18.538 --> 42:20.040
Sure was!

42:21.458 --> 42:23.543
Gee.
He's still alone?

42:23.585 --> 42:25.754
[chatters]

42:27.589 --> 42:29.090
Okay, uncle.

42:29.132 --> 42:30.925
Let's see what
this little guy's been up to.

42:30.967 --> 42:33.011
Elmer: And see
where's he's been.

42:33.053 --> 42:36.306
So maybe we can find
that spyglass.

42:36.348 --> 42:38.016
Emma: Uh, spyglass?

42:38.058 --> 42:39.017

[computer beeping]

42:43.313 --> 42:44.856
This line shows us

42:44.898 --> 42:47.192
where the seal pup has been.

42:47.233 --> 42:48.193
Huh?

42:48.234 --> 42:49.361
It looks like he's traveled

42:49.402 --> 42:51.071
all over the cape.

42:51.112 --> 42:52.197
[groans]

42:52.238 --> 42:53.865
That's terrible.

42:53.907 --> 42:55.492
It's gonna take us years

42:55.533 --> 42:58.203
to find Trumpet Tooter's
spyglass.

42:59.079 --> 43:00.372
Okay, uncle.

43:00.413 --> 43:02.665
Enough about the spyglass.

43:02.707 --> 43:04.668
I think we need
to find the seal pup.

43:04.709 --> 43:06.586
[keys clacking]

43:10.715 --> 43:12.258
[computer beeping]

43:12.300 --> 43:14.761
See?
There's the seal pup now.

43:15.387 --> 43:16.429
Oh.

43:16.471 --> 43:19.557
Elmer: Heading to Seal Rock.

43:19.599 --> 43:22.727
Oh, he's probably going
to his mother.

43:22.769 --> 43:24.229
If I plug his location

43:24.270 --> 43:26.398
into the satellite network,

43:26.439 --> 43:28.900
then maybe we can see them both.

43:28.942 --> 43:31.403
Yup, there's Seal Rock.

43:31.444 --> 43:34.572
It's home to hundreds of seals.

43:34.614 --> 43:36.616
[chatters]

43:37.742 --> 43:39.411
Let's zoom in even closer.

43:39.452 --> 43:42.497
We might be able
to spot the pup.

43:51.464 --> 43:53.216
[Emma laughs] Good eye, George!

43:54.175 --> 43:56.344
And that must be

43:56.386 --> 43:57.846
the pup's mother.

43:57.887 --> 43:59.681
Well, looks like she might be

43:59.723 --> 44:02.350
tangled in some fishing line.

44:02.392 --> 44:05.270
[chatters]

44:07.689 --> 44:10.025
I don't know
how we can help, George.

44:10.066 --> 44:12.569
When people approach,
the seals tend to panic

44:12.610 --> 44:14.320
and flee into the water.

44:14.362 --> 44:16.114
Some can even get hurt.

44:16.156 --> 44:17.615
Oh.

44:17.657 --> 44:19.034
[watch beeping]

44:21.953 --> 44:25.290
Ah, it's time for the early bird
dinner, George!

44:25.331 --> 44:27.292
[chattering]

44:32.839 --> 44:34.257
Tell you what, George.

44:34.299 --> 44:37.302
I'll keep trying to think of
a way to help the seals

44:37.344 --> 44:39.220
and if I do, I'll call you.

44:39.262 --> 44:41.639
Okay?

44:41.681 --> 44:43.308
[chatters]

44:45.185 --> 44:48.313
George, you are in for a treat!

44:48.355 --> 44:53.651
A Cod burger from the one
and only Codfather Restaurant!

44:53.693 --> 44:55.862
[chatters]

44:57.030 --> 44:59.824
Or maybe we should
get the codballs.

44:59.866 --> 45:02.827
Or the Codaroni and Cheese!

45:02.869 --> 45:04.537
Ah, heck, let's get it all!

45:04.579 --> 45:06.414
[chattering]

45:07.874 --> 45:12.295
And here we are!

45:12.337 --> 45:14.798

Closed!

45:26.351 --> 45:27.894
Rocco: Yeah.

45:30.063 --> 45:32.190
People came to the Codfather
for the cod,

45:32.232 --> 45:34.359
but the cod aren't biting
like they used to.

45:34.401 --> 45:35.860
[air hissing]

45:37.696 --> 45:40.365
Well, they better start biting.

45:40.407 --> 45:42.367
Cod Fest is in two days!

45:42.409 --> 45:43.910
Oh, but surely you've heard.

45:43.952 --> 45:47.580
Cod Fest was canceled
a month ago.

45:47.622 --> 45:48.623
Canceled!

45:48.665 --> 45:50.125
[chatters]

45:50.166 --> 45:53.336
I'm afraid you can't have
Cod Fest without cod.

45:54.796 --> 45:56.381
It's in the name.

45:56.423 --> 45:57.799
The cod's been overfished.

45:57.841 --> 46:01.094
So for now, no one's fishing.

46:01.136 --> 46:03.930
Hopefully, that'll bring
the cod back.

46:03.972 --> 46:08.768
But-- but this is <i>Coddington!</i>

46:08.810 --> 46:10.979
[instrumental music]

46:20.613 --> 46:23.783
I mean... without Cod Fest,

46:23.825 --> 46:26.077
why'd we even come here?

46:27.370 --> 46:29.330
For the balloons!

46:29.372 --> 46:31.166
[laughs]

46:37.130 --> 46:39.132

46:42.177 --> 46:44.262
Hmm.

46:44.304 --> 46:47.432
George,
when the going gets tough,

46:47.474 --> 46:49.517
the tough get going...

46:49.559 --> 46:51.436
[chatters]

46:52.812 --> 46:55.940
To another town.

46:55.982 --> 46:58.151
We'll leave in the morning.

47:09.704 --> 47:11.206
Oh, I'm so sorry.

47:11.247 --> 47:14.501
I thought you knew
Cod Fest got the heave-ho.

47:15.794 --> 47:17.212
Don't worry...

47:17.253 --> 47:20.006
I-- I worked up a new schedule
last night.

47:20.048 --> 47:21.925
Portotuna has a Tuna Carnival,

47:21.966 --> 47:24.010
and it's just five hours north.

47:24.052 --> 47:26.221
But-- but we're so close

47:26.262 --> 47:29.974
to finding
Trumpet-Tooter's spyglass.

47:30.016 --> 47:32.477
[chattering]

47:32.519 --> 47:35.647
George, I promised you
a great vacation,

47:35.689 --> 47:37.941
and that's what
we're gonna have!

47:37.982 --> 47:39.943
[grunting] Ooh!

47:42.487 --> 47:44.280
[groans]

47:47.826 --> 47:50.662

47:50.704 --> 47:53.832
I had high hopes for Coddington.

47:53.873 --> 47:56.668
But it's just
not how I remembered it.

47:56.710 --> 47:58.545
[chattering]

48:00.296 --> 48:03.508
Emma will make sure the seal pup
and his mom are alright.

48:03.550 --> 48:05.343
She doesn't need our help.

48:23.862 --> 48:25.238
Yup, we're all packed,

48:25.280 --> 48:27.782
and we'll still make
Portotuna by nightfall.

48:27.824 --> 48:31.995
Huh? No-- no, I mean your trip
to Seal Rock on the Magellan.

48:32.037 --> 48:34.372

Oh, hi there, momma.

56:15.500 --> 56:16.835
[seal groaning]

56:16.876 --> 56:19.879
That fishing line's
bothering you, isn't it?

56:19.921 --> 56:21.715
[squealing]

56:21.756 --> 56:24.009
Don't worry,
we'll get this off you.

Ted: Uh, Emma?

56:28.013 --> 56:29.848
[sniffing]

56:29.889 --> 56:32.392
I think they like
your herring smell.

56:32.434 --> 56:34.185
That's good.

56:34.227 --> 56:36.312
Keep them distracted.

56:36.354 --> 56:38.606
Yeah, but there's a lot of them.

56:38.648 --> 56:42.277
[giggling]
Okay. Come on! That tickles!

56:42.318 --> 56:43.862
Oh, stop!

56:43.903 --> 56:45.280
Oh! Oh! Careful.

56:45.321 --> 56:47.907
Stop! Stop!

56:47.949 --> 56:49.826
Whoo!

of "The Blue Danube"]

57:17.479 --> 57:18.897
[slurping]

57:18.938 --> 57:20.440
We'll keep her
at the COW overnight

57:20.482 --> 57:22.442
to make sure she heals okay.

57:22.484 --> 57:26.154
But thanks to you two,
she's going to be fine.

Hey, watch your fish-tossing!

57:38.375 --> 57:40.502
Ahh.

57:40.543 --> 57:42.921
<i>That's</i>a submersible.

57:46.466 --> 57:48.927
It's an underwater vehicle.

57:48.968 --> 57:52.138
I collect plant samples
on the sea floor with it.

57:53.056 --> 57:55.100
Ahh.
[giggles]

57:55.141 --> 57:56.810
Uh, George,

57:56.851 --> 57:59.020
I don't think
you should be in there

Bye!

We'll track 'em, catch 'em

Emma: Let's quickly
fire up the sonar...

58:47.777 --> 58:49.988
This will only take a second.

58:50.030 --> 58:51.031
Uh.

58:53.158 --> 58:58.163
Don't panic. It's probably just
like driving a submarine.

58:58.204 --> 59:01.791
[groaning] I wish I knew
how to drive a submarine.

59:02.876 --> 59:04.627

Oh, dear, they're headed for the
edge of the continental shelf.

It's a mile drop
straight down!

1:00:52.318 --> 1:00:53.778
Oh, wow!

1:00:53.820 --> 1:00:56.406
I guess when the vehicle
gets too deep,

1:00:56.448 --> 1:00:58.575
it triggers safety balloons.

1:00:58.616 --> 1:01:00.702
Hah! Who knew?

1:01:01.578 --> 1:01:03.997

had an amazing adventure.

Boy, you are <i>really</i>excited

1:02:10.980 --> 1:02:13.817
to pack the car
and get to Portotuna, huh?

1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:16.778
Ted: The museum?

1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:18.279
Oh, no George,

1:02:18.321 --> 1:02:21.449
Gertrude St. John
will never let us back in there!

1:02:24.661 --> 1:02:26.913
Hmm.

You gorgeous simian!

1:02:45.181 --> 1:02:46.891
Captain Elmer?

1:02:46.933 --> 1:02:50.061
Well, since that spyglass
hasn't turned up yet,

1:02:50.103 --> 1:02:53.982
I figured I just <i>had</i>
to show Gertrude the lens cap.

1:02:54.024 --> 1:02:57.902
Gertrude: This certainly is
Trumpet Tooter's lens cap.

1:02:57.944 --> 1:03:03.366
And I believe Trumpet-Tooter's
spyglass is out there too.

1:03:03.408 --> 1:03:05.368

1:03:14.711 --> 1:03:16.755
Oh, my God!

1:03:16.796 --> 1:03:18.882
George, you're not saying

1:03:18.923 --> 1:03:21.009
Trumpet Tooter's whole ship

1:03:21.051 --> 1:03:23.136
is out there, are you?

1:03:23.178 --> 1:03:24.971

1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:27.599
Gertrude: Wait!

1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:30.602
You saw <i>this</i>figurehead?

1:03:30.643 --> 1:03:32.771
Uh-huh.

Underwater?

1:03:34.481 --> 1:03:35.940
[chattering]

1:03:35.982 --> 1:03:41.321
We, um, did have a little
underwater adventure.

1:03:43.323 --> 1:03:46.159
Is it possible the ship
actually sank here?

1:03:46.201 --> 1:03:48.787
Well, the legend
only states that

1:03:48.828 --> 1:03:51.164
after the ship
wandered into Coddington,

1:03:51.206 --> 1:03:53.708
it was never seen again, so...

1:03:53.750 --> 1:03:55.835
So the Shiny Cutlass

1:03:55.877 --> 1:03:59.506
could very well be
at the bottom of our Bay!

1:03:59.547 --> 1:04:01.758
[chuckles]
George,

1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:04.177
if you're right about this...

1:04:04.219 --> 1:04:07.639
Coddington will become
a destination again.

1:04:07.681 --> 1:04:10.809
And thrive
'til the cod come back!

1:04:10.850 --> 1:04:12.519
[laughs]

1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:16.439

to that same spot tomorrow?

1:04:18.483 --> 1:04:21.027
Wait... Tomorrow?

1:04:24.531 --> 1:04:26.491
[instrumental music]

1:04:29.869 --> 1:04:32.580
I guess it means

1:04:32.622 --> 1:04:34.457
I don't need this schedule

1:04:34.499 --> 1:04:38.503
because "This sailor goes
where the wind takes him!"

1:04:38.545 --> 1:04:40.839
Let's go find a ship!

What are all
these people doing here?

1:05:30.722 --> 1:05:33.725
Oh, guess word got around...

1:05:33.767 --> 1:05:35.935
We may have made a few calls.

1:05:36.728 --> 1:05:38.813
This is all for us?

Uh-huh.

1:06:20.647 --> 1:06:24.526
So are you boys ready
for another adventure?

Anyone can make a mistake.

You did everything you could.

the submersible

to move the collapsed reef?

1:18:02.682 --> 1:18:04.476
It's not strong enough.

1:26:56.591 --> 1:26:59.219
* When you're right
in the middle *

1:26:59.260 --> 1:27:04.182
* Of a mystery *

1:27:04.224 --> 1:27:11.064
* Oh the mystery,
full of curiosity *

1:27:11.106 --> 1:27:13.858
* There's no better place
to be *

1:27:13.900 --> 1:27:17.028
* Than right in the middle *

1:27:17.070 --> 1:27:20.448
* Smack-dab in the middle *

1:27:20.490 --> 1:27:23.201
* Way down in the middle *

1:27:23.243 --> 1:27:26.663
* Of a mystery *

1:27:31.918 --> 1:27:35.213
* My my *

1:27:35.255 --> 1:27:37.549
* Oh wow *

1:27:37.590 --> 1:27:40.427
* You know you're right
in the middle *

1:27:40.468 --> 1:27:45.765
* Of a mystery **
