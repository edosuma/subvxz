[narrator]
Previously on Chesapeake Shores:

00:02.919 --> 00:05.463
That developer, Evan Kincaid,
he rubs me the wrong way.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.590
Why? He's witty and dynamic.

00:07.674 --> 00:08.758
[Bree] I met my nemesis.

00:08.842 --> 00:12.345
I had a hard time getting to know people.
And you were out of my league.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.180
-I'll take the job.
-So he was cute?

00:14.264 --> 00:17.225
[Linda] Mr. Dilpher,
I'm glad you're letting us represent you.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.185
We have an inside track on Mick O'Brien.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.478
[Kevin] You know The Bridge?

00:20.562 --> 00:22.480
Wondering if you're interested
in working there.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.608
I appreciate it.
But I'm not looking for charity.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.111
-You deserve the best, Abby.
-So do you.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.113
[Trace] Maybe now we'll find it.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.666
-Morning.
-Morning.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.084
I am running late.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.086
Coffee? Please say there is.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.005
There's coffee. What do you think?

00:47.088 --> 00:48.548
-Pick a centerpiece.
-For what?

00:48.631 --> 00:50.550
For what? Your sister's wedding.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.720
Which is gonna be here before we know it.
Jess asked for help.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.473
We need a centerpiece
that will go on every table.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.433
-I like that one.
-Which one?

00:58.516 --> 01:00.727
-That one.
-This one with the daisies?

01:01.519 --> 01:03.605
-Yeah! That one.
-Yeah?

01:03.688 --> 01:05.565
-I like them all.
-And that's the problem.

01:05.648 --> 01:09.027
I know. I'm trying to see
all sides to the story.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.780
As a writing teacher,
I can't be too judgmental.

01:11.863 --> 01:13.615
Well, I still need your opinion.

01:13.698 --> 01:14.657
I like them all!

01:15.658 --> 01:18.828
Okay, fine.
I like the one with the blue ribbon.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.247
-That's my favorite too.
-Morning.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.165
Morning!

01:22.248 --> 01:24.250
Get this message from the Kincaid site?

01:24.334 --> 01:25.794
[Mick] Yeah. Not good.

01:25.877 --> 01:29.380
Texting Larry right now
to tell him we're on our way. Sorry.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.966
They uncovered asbestos pipes
in the ground

01:32.050 --> 01:34.219
and if it's contaminated the soil,
it could shut us down.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.512
[Megan] Oh, that's awful.

01:35.595 --> 01:36.721
Ah, it'll be fine.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.516
So it's not the best time
to ask your opinion on the centerpiece?

01:39.599 --> 01:41.935
Oh. Um... I like them all.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.062
Blue ribbon. Bye!

01:46.439 --> 01:49.234

[vocalizing]

03:07.562 --> 03:12.734
We go to court today on
Bodnar et al. v. MacLeod Industries.

03:12.817 --> 03:16.070
A class action suit. Where do we stand?

03:16.154 --> 03:19.532
We have two principal plaintiffs,
and affidavits from 400 others

03:19.616 --> 03:22.952
claiming salary disparity
between men and women at the company.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.456
MacLeod is trying
to have the case dismissed. Of course.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.459
Of course. Who's presiding?

03:29.542 --> 03:30.793
Judge Martinez.

03:33.129 --> 03:34.380
Um...

03:34.464 --> 03:36.299
-I'm sorry, did I speak out of turn?
-No.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.592
Not at all, O'Brien.

03:37.675 --> 03:40.720
Please, tell us more about Judge Martinez.

03:40.803 --> 03:44.599
Well, from my research,
um, he is a strict constitutionalist.

03:44.682 --> 03:47.477
-Mm-hm.
-He's a real stickler for the law.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.604
Yeah, and a fine golfer and a good friend.

03:49.687 --> 03:52.690
Linda and I have known Jim Martinez
for years.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.025
I think we can handle him.

03:54.108 --> 03:56.027
I'm sure you can, sir.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.070
Good.

03:58.655 --> 04:02.158
Linda, why don't you take O'Brien
with you for second chair?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.952
He's been here a couple of months,

04:04.035 --> 04:06.704
time for him
to get some on-the-job training.

04:09.749 --> 04:10.667
Thank you, sir.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.881
You wanna sit down so we can continue?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.176
Oh. Uh...

04:20.260 --> 04:21.135
Yes, sir.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.484
You sure you wouldn't rather
be back at the office?

04:36.567 --> 04:38.820
They can just as easily reach me here.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.030
The wonders of the digital age.

04:41.114 --> 04:41.948
Yeah.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.451
You okay?

04:46.119 --> 04:47.495
Well, I'm trying to be.

04:47.578 --> 04:50.999
Soil tests are being done
and we can't reach Evan Kincaid.

04:51.082 --> 04:54.919
I have no control over that.
So I'll relax and enjoy myself.

04:55.545 --> 04:59.340
You know, I had forgotten
how much I love this place.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.719
Well, this is where I found
that vintage Baltimore Orioles mug

05:02.802 --> 05:05.972
-I gave you last Christmas.
-Oh, then I love it even more.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.190
-Mick, look.
-Hm?

05:16.774 --> 05:17.692
What is it?

05:18.693 --> 05:20.737
Is this Chesapeake Shores?

05:20.820 --> 05:24.532
That's the bay, but so few houses.
It's gotta be at least 30 years ago.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.619
Uh, excuse me. How much is this?

05:28.703 --> 05:29.537
Eight.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.040
-Hundred?
-[laughing] Funny.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.542
Oh. Eight bucks.

05:35.877 --> 05:36.836
My treat.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.880
You big spender.

05:38.963 --> 05:42.341
Well, I'm a huge patron
of the under-ten-dollar arts.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.011
-Here you go. Thank you.
-Thanks.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.430
You own a painting.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.473
Thank you, Mick.

05:49.140 --> 05:49.974
Welcome.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.602
I think this is an Arthur Driscoll.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.438
-And that's good?
-Mm! Yeah. Very good.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.690
It's not impossible.
He used to summer here.

05:57.774 --> 05:58.983
-I think I've heard of him.
-Mm.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.402
He was a big deal
in the art world in the '60s.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.946
-Mm-hm.
-A rising star.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.240
-What happened to him?
-Nobody really knows.

06:06.991 --> 06:10.453
He stopped painting in the '70s
and sort of disappeared.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.747
There are very few verified Driscolls.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.415
Well, it is beautiful.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.085
And if it's authentic, this is a find.

06:17.168 --> 06:20.505
If you sell it for a million bucks,
$8 of that is mine.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.842
Although we all love Betty,
I think we can agree,

06:24.926 --> 06:27.011
she's getting a little long in the tooth.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.847
We love her, but let's face it,

06:30.890 --> 06:32.100
she needs to retire.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.019
We're long overdue for a new fire engine,

06:35.103 --> 06:37.480
and the council have come up with funds

06:37.563 --> 06:40.024
to present us with one
on Chesapeake Shores Day.

06:40.108 --> 06:44.153
We'll be hosting a fire safety booth
and giving tours of the fire house.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.822
Volunteer sheets are up.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.033
Oh, and the
Chesapeake Shores Day triathlon

06:49.117 --> 06:50.493
is coming up soon.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.329
Now, let's get to work
keeping the Shores safe, huh?

06:54.622 --> 06:56.207
Uh, Cap.

06:56.290 --> 07:00.628
Listen, my brother's biking, I'm running.
Still looking for a strong swimmer.

07:00.711 --> 07:05.133
Thank you, but, uh, my Australian crawl
isn't what it used to be.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.676
Maybe you could coach me, then?

07:06.759 --> 07:09.679
-I know your college track record.
-Oh, that's a million years ago.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.472
But, yeah, I'd love to.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.266
-Yeah?
-Work out a schedule

07:13.349 --> 07:14.892
and make it happen, Karl.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.606
-Did he just call me Karl?
-I think so.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.025
Come to think of it,
you do look like a Karl.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.486
-Do I?
-Little bit.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.780
Still looking for a swimmer.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.491
Count me out.
I'm running with Brenda and Tabitha.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.994
-That is a killer trio.
-I like our chances.

07:33.619 --> 07:37.206
Since we'll both be running,
we'll compete against each other.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.709
-Are you worried that I'll beat you?
-Maybe.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.129
Husband versus wife.
Dangerous territory here.

07:43.212 --> 07:44.755
Whatever you say, Karl.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.884
That's very funny.

07:49.510 --> 07:52.054
No, I need to speak
to Mr. Kincaid himself.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.056
It's about the Chesapeake Shores project.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.476
When will he be available?

07:57.226 --> 07:59.645
That's not good enough.
I understand he's busy.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.857
We're all busy.
Listen, this is not how I do business.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.902
You tell him to call me today
or this entire deal is off.

08:06.819 --> 08:07.653
Thank you.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.908
-[Thomas] That's telling him.
-Uncle Thomas. How are you?

08:11.991 --> 08:14.702
Better than whoever
you were just talking to.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.580
-What was that about?
-Just an important client.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.166
Don't let him push you around,
don't let it bother you.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.210
-Yeah, I'm okay.
-Yeah?

08:22.293 --> 08:24.837
You got that line between your eyebrows.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.007
Oh, I know.
I haven't been sleeping very well.

08:28.090 --> 08:31.636
-It's the Dilpher thing, isn't it?
-Yes. Yeah.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.804
Dad's reputation is really taking a hit.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.140
And we're losing clients.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.892
I might've just lost another one.

08:37.975 --> 08:41.020
-Not really sure what we're gonna do.
-How's Mick taking all this?

08:41.103 --> 08:44.774
He's angry, and confused, and hiding it.

08:44.857 --> 08:48.361
-That's Mick, all right.
-So, uh, what are you doing in town?

08:48.444 --> 08:50.738
I'm on my way to Baltimore
to, uh, check out a property.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.740
We need a presence in the city.

08:52.823 --> 08:55.660
You know,
we own a block in the Hampton area.

08:55.743 --> 08:59.080
-It would be great as an office building.
-Well, that's the spirit.

08:59.163 --> 09:02.500
Send me the specs.
I'll stop by and see how Mick's doing.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.584
He'd like that.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.170
-It's great to see you, Abby.
-You too, Uncle Thomas.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.630
-[cell phone chimes]
-Bye.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.467
Oh, son of a--

09:14.262 --> 09:15.763
Good afternoon.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.723
We have a busy docket today

09:17.807 --> 09:20.434
and I would like to keep things moving.

09:20.518 --> 09:25.273
Case number 559903.

09:25.356 --> 09:28.734
The class action suit
alleging unfair wage discrimination

09:28.818 --> 09:32.655
against female workers
at MacLeod Industries.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.409
Ms. Nelson. Nice to see you again.

09:36.492 --> 09:39.662
You are arguing against the motion
to dismiss, I assume.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.747
-Yes, Your Honor.
-[Martinez] Before we get started,

09:41.831 --> 09:44.834
there are laws in place
preventing wage discrimination.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.460
So why are we here?

09:46.544 --> 09:48.796
We're here because MacLeod Industries

09:48.879 --> 09:51.882
is using work disparity
and physical strength

09:51.966 --> 09:55.595
to justify paying its female employees
less than its men.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.681
And you're arguing
that women are as strong as men.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.809
I'm not sure I agree with you.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.227
[scoffs]

10:05.938 --> 10:07.481
You think I'm wrong?

10:08.566 --> 10:11.569
-Pardon me, Your Honor?
-What's your name, son?

10:12.111 --> 10:14.655
Uh, Connor O'Brien, Your Honor.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.782
[Martinez] Well, Connor O'Brien,

10:16.866 --> 10:19.869
don't you agree
that people of the male gender tend,

10:19.952 --> 10:22.788
on average,
to have greater upper body strength

10:22.872 --> 10:25.333
-than those of the female gender?
-Yes.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.001
And we're dealing specifically,

10:27.084 --> 10:30.338
as I understand it,
with warehouse workers.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.923
Lifting things, am I correct?

10:33.007 --> 10:35.134
-Yes, Your Honor.
-All right, then.

10:35.217 --> 10:36.218
But...

10:37.428 --> 10:41.557
Mr. O'Brien, you better make
a cogent argument or pack up and leave.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.436
Uh, yes, Your Honor, I-- I--

10:46.062 --> 10:48.272
-I'm waiting, Mr. O'Brien.
-Yes. I--

10:50.733 --> 10:52.443
I have three sisters, Your Honor.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.947
That's your argument? You have sisters?

10:57.031 --> 10:59.116
Yes, sir. Three of them.

10:59.950 --> 11:00.910
And?

11:01.452 --> 11:05.289
And I find that women
are capable of doing anything men can do.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.208
That's an opinion, Mr. O'Brien,

11:07.291 --> 11:10.586
-and not a mitigating factor here.
-Isn't it, though?

11:10.670 --> 11:13.589
Your Honor,
I'm talking about a deeper strength.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.675
One not represented by physical labor.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.388
When women are presented with a problem,

11:20.471 --> 11:24.600
they don't just solve that problem,
they think three steps past it.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.977
And they get the job done.

11:28.229 --> 11:31.232
[pensive music playing]

11:34.819 --> 11:36.695
That was amazing.

11:36.779 --> 11:37.613
Was it?

11:41.158 --> 11:43.369
Enough to have him deny dismissal.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.621
I've never seen Martinez do that.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.498
Well, I Googled him.

11:48.582 --> 11:51.419
-He was raised by a single mother.
-Pretty clever.

11:53.921 --> 11:56.632
Nice work.
I like how you made it personal.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.635
You had a lot to do with that.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.886
I did, didn't I?

12:02.304 --> 12:04.723
And I just told Judge Martinez the truth.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.392
An unprecedented legal strategy.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.911
-Buyer's remorse?
-Not at all.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.082
Even though the signature corner
is damaged,

12:30.166 --> 12:32.376
I really think this is a Driscoll.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.796
-Did you contact the estate?
-There are no living relatives.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.549
But I tracked down
an art gallery in New York.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.384
They gave me an old contact number.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.137
-What did they say?
-Called a few times.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.472
Just rings.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.432
No answer, no voicemail.

12:46.515 --> 12:49.143
-Why don't you try again?
-Yeah.

12:50.394 --> 12:53.022
-Hey, Dad, do you have a second?
-Yeah, sure.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.816
Take a look at this.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.487
[line dialing]

12:59.570 --> 13:00.446
[man] Hello?

13:00.529 --> 13:03.240
Oh. Yes. Hello.

13:03.324 --> 13:07.620
Um, I am calling concerning a person
named Arthur Driscoll.

13:07.703 --> 13:08.537
Speaking.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.457
Arthur Driscoll?

13:11.540 --> 13:12.666
That's what I said.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.838
Well, it is wonderful
to speak with you, Mr. Driscoll.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.841
I think that I found a painting of yours.

13:20.925 --> 13:24.803
Good for you. Hang it over
your fireplace with my blessing.

13:24.887 --> 13:25.888
[line disconnects]

13:26.430 --> 13:27.348
Uh-- Uh...

13:28.265 --> 13:30.684
Mr. Driscoll? Hello?

13:31.852 --> 13:32.853
[scoffs]

13:32.937 --> 13:34.605
Sure it's from Evan Kincaid?

13:34.688 --> 13:37.441
It says it is,
and that he is calling us at 5:00.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.818
[groans] He wants to FaceTime.
I hate those.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.445
But he could be anywhere.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.031
We don't know if he means
Eastern Time or Pacific Time.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.991
If it's Pacific, it's 2 p.m.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.744
But if he's in London, it'd be 10.
Paris, 11.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.746
You know that off the top of your head?

13:50.829 --> 13:53.916
-I worked in finance. You learn it.
-Yeah.

13:53.999 --> 13:57.711
Well, it's 3:30 now,
it gives us time to work out a strategy.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.797
-Now, the soil samples are--
-[FaceTime ringing]

13:59.880 --> 14:00.881
What's that?

14:01.882 --> 14:03.676
It's Kincaid. How'd he get my number?

14:03.759 --> 14:05.094
He's rich?

14:06.303 --> 14:08.389
-[Evan] Hey.
-Hello, uh, Mr. Kincaid.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.224
-Hello?
-Dad, you're on mute.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.017
-Mick, you there?
-I know that.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.852
-Mick?
-Um...

14:13.936 --> 14:15.563
Hello, Mick!

14:15.646 --> 14:17.356
-Hey there.
-[Abby] Hi.

14:17.439 --> 14:20.025
Uh, Mr. Kincaid,
we were expecting you at 5.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.194
Yeah, it's 5. Here in Newfoundland.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.947
They have such crazy time zones.
Can you talk?

14:25.030 --> 14:27.241
-Uh, sure.
-Abby! Is that you?

14:27.324 --> 14:29.535
Yes. Hi. Abby O'Brien.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.829
Ah, I don't do last names.
Too complicated.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.998
I'm Evan, you're Abby. Right, Mick?

14:34.081 --> 14:37.334
So this asbestos thing,
kick in the pants, isn't it?

14:38.002 --> 14:40.963
Sounds complicated. I'm pulling out.
I can build somewhere else.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.674
Wait, Mr.-- Um, Evan.

14:43.757 --> 14:47.511
Of course you can build somewhere else,
but there's only one Chesapeake Shores.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.848
-Where's Chesapeake Shores?
-Where you're building your hotel.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.349
Oh, right.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.143
Yeah, I'm sorry. I knew that.

14:54.226 --> 14:58.147
I have a million contracts.
Figuratively or literally.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.857
Have you ever been here?

14:59.940 --> 15:02.109
It's one of the most beautiful places
in the world.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.819
You know what? Just a sec.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.863
Okay, yeah. There we go.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.616
-Evan, what are you doing?
-I'm rock climbing.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.744
Well, mountain climbing, actually.
It's beautiful.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.163
So why are you calling us now?

15:14.246 --> 15:17.791
Klaus said you wanted me to.
You scared Klaus, you know?

15:17.875 --> 15:21.295
-Nothing scares Klaus.
-Uh, well, thank you, I guess.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.632
Tell you what,
I can hear the passion in your voice.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.508
-How about we chat tomorrow?
-Sure.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.636
Could you tell us what time you'll call?

15:28.719 --> 15:31.513
-Eastern Standard Time.
-Nah, forget the call.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.182
-I'll come by.
-Excuse me?

15:33.265 --> 15:35.267
I have to be in D.C. this weekend.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.686
I'll stop by on the way. Be seeing you.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.901
He's stopping by.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.028
Oh, joy.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.082
-Need a spotter?
-Hey, Thomas.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.750
No, I'm good. Thanks.

16:01.126 --> 16:04.088
So you bought back The Bridge, huh?

16:04.171 --> 16:06.173
Yeah. I should have my head examined.

16:06.256 --> 16:08.842
Turns out we have issues
with plumbing and electrical.

16:08.926 --> 16:12.012
Well, I recall the, uh,
chicken wings being pretty good.

16:12.096 --> 16:15.349
I do have that going for me.
What brings you down here?

16:15.432 --> 16:18.227
I've been looking
for a new office in Baltimore,

16:18.310 --> 16:23.607
and Abby said that your
Hampton area property would be ideal.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.610
-She did?
-Yeah.

16:26.694 --> 16:31.031
So if the numbers are doable,
we should discuss.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.159
I'm kind of swamped now.
We got this new client.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.121
Yeah, the infamous Evan Kincaid.

16:37.204 --> 16:38.497
Yeah, precisely.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.543
I just hope I don't have
to replace all the wires here.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.295
Hello.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.881
Excuse me. Uh, Mick O'Brien?

16:47.965 --> 16:50.134
-Yes.
-It's Luke Tatum.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.303
I went to high school with,
uh, Abby and Kevin.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.098
Oh, Luke. Yes, how are you?
Good to see you.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.142
-Yeah.
-It's been a while, huh?

16:58.225 --> 16:59.059
Yes, it has.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.688
-I'm not disturbing you?
-No. This is my brother, Thomas.

17:02.771 --> 17:03.772
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.442
Um, I'll leave you to it, Mick.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.945
But we need to discuss those
Hampton numbers sometime soon.

17:10.029 --> 17:10.863
Okay.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.157
-Nice meeting you.
-Same here.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.492
So Kevin tells me you moved back home.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.287
-Yes, sir.
-Your parents were good people.

17:18.370 --> 17:21.165
I remember your father
cheering at your basketball games

17:21.248 --> 17:22.583
and your track meets.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.461
Yeah, he was very supportive.

17:25.544 --> 17:26.462
Yes, he was.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.007
Wow, nice, uh, place you have here.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.551
Thank you. I hear you're looking for work.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.386
Yes, sir. I am.

17:34.470 --> 17:38.390
Well, it could be good timing.
I definitely need help around here.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.558
I can't promise much.

17:39.641 --> 17:43.437
Just helping out, unloading deliveries,
sweeping up, and such.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.356
-You might not be interested in that.
-It would interest me.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.566
Good.

17:47.649 --> 17:48.734
Now, what's--?

17:49.526 --> 17:51.070
What's with your fuse box?

17:51.153 --> 17:52.446
Oh, we just--

17:52.529 --> 17:54.740
We did the whole new lighting system
over the stage.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.575
Now we keep blowing fuses.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.994
-Mind if I take a look?
-No. Help yourself.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.374
Hm.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.753
They have an undersized breaker
for the lighting grid.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.922
-That's right.
-Yeah.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.424
And your rectifiers...

18:13.801 --> 18:16.678
probably have it on half wave
and, uh, I think you need full wave.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.555
You worked as an electrician?

18:19.181 --> 18:21.850
No, just a little of this,
a little of that.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.019
A jack of all trades, but master of none.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.687
-Story of my life.
-Oh, yeah?

18:25.771 --> 18:26.605
Yeah.

18:27.439 --> 18:30.859
Listen, why don't you plan
to start tomorrow and we'll try this out.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.196
-Thank you, sir.
-Mick.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.614
Mick, it is.

18:35.697 --> 18:38.117
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.994
[upbeat music playing]

18:47.376 --> 18:49.128
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.880
-You got a minute?
-Mm-hm.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.507
Um...

18:54.758 --> 18:57.511
-You spoke with Thomas earlier today?
-Yeah.

18:57.594 --> 19:00.806
And, uh... you pitched him
the Baltimore property, right?

19:00.889 --> 19:02.850
-I did.
-Well...

19:04.309 --> 19:06.103
I know you meant well,

19:06.812 --> 19:09.565
but I'd rather you talk to me
about these things first, okay?

19:10.774 --> 19:12.526
Sure. Is there a problem?

19:12.609 --> 19:16.029
Well, I don't wanna be
in business with my brother.

19:16.864 --> 19:20.701
We're getting along so well
for the first time in years,

19:20.784 --> 19:23.787
and I think we should keep
our business interests separate.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.622
Of course, yeah.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.333
But, hey, are you, uh...

19:29.293 --> 19:31.670
Are you sure
that's really what's bothering you?

19:31.753 --> 19:35.966
And it's not the Kincaid or Dilpher thing?

19:36.049 --> 19:40.220
Well, it's probably all three,
and maybe more Dilpher and Kincaid.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.436
-Hey, Pops.
-Hm?

19:47.519 --> 19:48.395
Need some ice cream?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.689
-Do you?
-Always.

19:50.772 --> 19:53.734
-Oh, yes. I would love some ice cream.
-[laughs]

19:55.068 --> 19:55.986
All right.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.947
-Two spoons?
-Mint chocolate chip.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.533
Thank you, Ms. Neary.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.619
Now that we've heard from
MacLeod Industries,

20:03.702 --> 20:05.245
it's the plaintiff's turn.

20:05.329 --> 20:09.374
Who are we hearing from today,
Ms. Nelson or Mr. O'Brien?

20:12.252 --> 20:13.587
Thank you, Your Honor.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.632
As I was sitting here,

20:16.715 --> 20:19.760
listening to the distinguished lawyers
for the defendant,

20:20.552 --> 20:22.387
I couldn't help but feel sorry for them.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.307
They wanted the case dismissed.
That didn't happen.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.768
Now, as we prepare for trial,

20:27.851 --> 20:31.730
all they can do is try and mock
and minimize the seriousness

20:31.813 --> 20:32.814
of this class action.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.234
Ms. Neary said
the female plaintiffs in this case

20:35.317 --> 20:38.862
are "never satisfied"
and "playing the victim card."

20:38.946 --> 20:41.365
That could not be further from the truth.

20:41.448 --> 20:44.368
Eleanor Holmes Norton,
who sued Newsweek Magazine in 1970

20:44.451 --> 20:47.704
because women were not allowed
to be reporters, was told the same thing.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.791
Very interesting, Mr. O'Brien,
but get to the point.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.542
The point I'm making, Your Honor,

20:52.626 --> 20:55.420
is that this is what women
are always told when they want equality.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.130
Like in the Newsweek case,

20:57.214 --> 21:01.260
they were forced to a subsidiary role
simply because of their sex.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.345
It's the same with MacLeod Industries.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.430
Yes, in general, men are stronger.

21:05.514 --> 21:06.974
Men can lift more than women,

21:07.057 --> 21:11.019
but at MacLeod,
most of the men use a forklift.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.439
And every female
who applied for forklift training

21:14.523 --> 21:16.942
was not allowed to pursue it.
And, let's be honest,

21:17.025 --> 21:19.278
the forklift is the equalizer here,
is it not?

21:19.361 --> 21:22.072
This isn't just about equal pay
for equal work.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.366
This is about females
being denied the chance

21:24.449 --> 21:26.868
to become higher-paid
forklift operators at MacLeod.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.413
To quote the 1970 Newsweek case,

21:29.496 --> 21:32.624
"Simply because of their sex."

21:39.089 --> 21:41.174
Well, he is officially five minutes late.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.593
Guys like that are always late.
It's a power play.

21:43.677 --> 21:46.096
I know. Their time
is more important than ours.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.849
Hey, there you are. I didn't mind waiting.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.601
I like getting to appointments
half hour early. Saves time.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.936
-Hello, Mick.
-Hey, Larry.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.647
I had Larry here show me around.
I hope you don't mind.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.357
It's really impressive.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.777
-You do good work, Mick, Abby.
-Well, thank you.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.947
-I've done this a few times.
-Of course. Shame on me.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.699
I'm sorry. What are you standing on?

22:05.782 --> 22:07.492
Oh, this, it's a hoverboard.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.329
I'm thinking of investing in them,
so thought I'd try it out.

22:10.412 --> 22:11.747
It's kind of fun.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.624
What do you think about the pipes?

22:14.708 --> 22:16.585
-Is it a problem?
-We don't know yet.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.879
We have soil specialists
coming down from D.C.

22:18.962 --> 22:21.840
Yeah. I don't think it'll be a problem.

22:21.923 --> 22:24.009
This place is beautiful.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.219
The town, the whole region.

22:26.303 --> 22:29.514
-Why didn't I know about it?
-It's a well-kept secret.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.766
It shouldn't be.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.351
I've lost interest.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.272
-What?
-In the hoverboard. It's just a toy.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.776
-You want it?
-Uh, sure.

22:42.277 --> 22:46.740
Uh, so the soil contamination
may not be a serious issue.

22:46.823 --> 22:47.699
That's what I said.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.410
But it might be a serious issue.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.830
Okay. I know the governor,
so we could do a work-around.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.916
Unless the soil is contaminated.

22:55.999 --> 22:59.503
I'm confused. Are you trying to talk me
into doing the project or not?

22:59.586 --> 23:01.046
I'm just stating the facts.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.756
Wow. Facts.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.842
-Amazing concept, right?
-Straight shooter.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.303
-That's how I was raised.
-Good job.

23:08.386 --> 23:11.056
I had very little to do with it.
She came out that way.

23:12.140 --> 23:14.768
I'll tell you what, Abby.
I'll hang out for a couple days.

23:14.851 --> 23:17.687
Wait to see what they say
and just get to know the place.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.564
-It's a nice place.
-It is.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.608
It reminds me
of the West Coast of Ireland.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.735
-[Mick] Have you been there?
-Yeah, I have a place.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.279
-Of course he does.
-Hey, is the fishing good here?

23:26.363 --> 23:28.156
-The best.
-Oh, really?

23:28.240 --> 23:30.826
I've never gone fishing.
Oh, I have to try it.

23:31.618 --> 23:34.246
-So are we done here?
-Yeah, I think so. Don't you?

23:34.329 --> 23:35.831
We can give you a ride back.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.749
-That's okay. I have a car.
-Where?

23:37.833 --> 23:38.875
Oh, it's nearby.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.503
Mandrake, I'm ready.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.005
Okay. Be seeing you.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.389
The rich are different.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.308
He certainly is.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.774
[speaking indistinctly]

24:02.858 --> 24:04.609
Great. Thank you so much.

24:05.443 --> 24:08.113
-Hello, Keller.
-Hello, O'Brien.

24:08.196 --> 24:10.866
-Still feeling flushed from your victory?
-Kind of.

24:11.741 --> 24:13.660
Keep an eye out for the sharks.

24:13.743 --> 24:16.830
-Well, aren't I a shark now?
-That remains to be seen.

24:16.913 --> 24:22.169
You do have sharp teeth, but something
about you seems more dolphin-esque.

24:22.252 --> 24:26.506
-Thank you, I think.
-You're welcome, I think.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.636
-Bye.
-Bye.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.315
[pensive music playing]

24:49.946 --> 24:52.991
-So memoir writing?
-Mm-hm.

24:53.074 --> 24:55.243
I like it. The students are gonna love it.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.955
Good. Write what you know.
Write what you are. Three texts.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.625
-The Confessions by Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
-Mm-hm.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.376
Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant

25:03.460 --> 25:07.255
and The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas
by Gertrude Stein.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.884
-I've definitely read one of those.
-Oh, you should read all of them.

25:11.384 --> 25:12.552
I will.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.388
And then I'll move them
into fictionalizing.

25:15.472 --> 25:17.557
-Like you did with your book?
-Yeah.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.894
Can I ask you a question?

25:22.520 --> 25:26.107
The character Mark Davies, was he...?

25:26.191 --> 25:27.484
You?

25:27.567 --> 25:28.526
Yeah.

25:29.569 --> 25:33.198
He was, um, an amalgamation.

25:33.657 --> 25:34.658
Hm.

25:35.325 --> 25:38.286
-So that's another way of saying yes.
-Yeah.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.831
I needed a villain for Chapter 10.

25:41.915 --> 25:45.418
Huh. Well, I'm glad I could oblige.

25:45.502 --> 25:49.547
How did you get into academia?
I figured you'd go into politics.

25:49.631 --> 25:52.717
What's more political
than college administration?

25:52.801 --> 25:54.135
Really, what happened?

25:55.011 --> 25:58.348
Well, um, when I came here as a student,

25:58.431 --> 26:01.685
I had every intention of going
to law school and running for office,

26:01.768 --> 26:04.437
but I read The Great Gatsby.

26:05.730 --> 26:12.028
And it opened my eyes, and I kept
on reading and I guess I changed.

26:12.612 --> 26:13.488
Yeah.

26:15.532 --> 26:19.160
You're not at all who I thought
you were gonna become.

26:20.745 --> 26:23.957
-I think you meant that as a compliment.
-Oh, yes. No, I do.

26:24.040 --> 26:24.874
Yeah.

26:27.544 --> 26:30.505
-How many miles did you bike?
-[Megan] A little over five.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.592
-Oh, that's great.
-Yeah, tell that to my hamstrings.

26:35.302 --> 26:37.887
I rode by what I think
is Arthur Driscoll's house.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.681
-Oh, yeah?
-Turns out Nell knows him.

26:39.764 --> 26:42.892
They used to summer here and
Nell used to be friendly with his wife.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.477
When she died, she lost touch.

26:44.561 --> 26:47.564
If you think that's his house
why don't you just go?

26:47.647 --> 26:51.067
Easier said than done.
I called him and he hung up on me.

26:51.151 --> 26:54.904
Be persistent. If you'd quit after a mile,
you never would have made it to five.

26:55.613 --> 26:56.990
-You're a good trainer.
-Yeah.

26:57.657 --> 26:58.658
Perfect.

27:00.368 --> 27:03.330
See you at the triathlon, darling.

27:04.331 --> 27:06.541
-I'll send you the bill.
-[bicycle bell chimes]

27:06.624 --> 27:08.835
-Hello, who is this?
-It's Evan.

27:09.669 --> 27:12.005
Oh, uh, it says Mandrake.

27:12.088 --> 27:15.383
He's my driver. My phone's out.
I wanted to say goodbye.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.301
You're leaving?

27:16.384 --> 27:18.762
Yeah, I'm gonna play golf then head out.

27:18.845 --> 27:21.473
-What about the soil test?
-Oh, I've decided not to build.

27:21.556 --> 27:24.517
Don't wanna mess with OSHA.
We'll find another place for a hotel.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.603
-Bye.
-No. Wait, you can't do that.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.146
-Hello.
-Whoa, hey.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.107
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.943
But you know you could be written up
for WWP.

27:34.736 --> 27:37.197
-What?
-It's walking while phoning.

27:37.280 --> 27:41.326
-Oh, yeah. I hate when people do that.
-Yeah.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.371
Abby, what's wrong?

27:45.163 --> 27:48.333
Nothing, just everything.
This crazy person.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.086
Hey, come here.

27:52.253 --> 27:53.296
-What?
-Breathe.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.131
-Okay.
-All right?

27:55.215 --> 27:57.217
-Yeah.
-Now close your eyes.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.802
Come on, close your eyes.

28:01.971 --> 28:03.390
Now count to five.

28:04.307 --> 28:05.975
One, two, three...

28:07.811 --> 28:09.479
[sighs] four...

28:12.315 --> 28:13.149
five.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.026
Now open your eyes.

28:18.988 --> 28:19.989
What do you see?

28:20.782 --> 28:23.159
-You.
-Yeah, you do. But what else?

28:25.036 --> 28:26.204
-Sally's.
-Mm-hm.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.622
Now what do you smell?

28:28.331 --> 28:30.291
-Cornbread.
-Oh, yeah.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.543
Smells good, right?

28:32.252 --> 28:34.295
-Mm-hm.
-You feel better?

28:35.046 --> 28:37.590
-I do.
-Well, let's see about that.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.761
Oh, yes. Much better.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.014
It's nice to see you.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.683
You too, Jay.

28:56.359 --> 28:59.404
-You got a sec?
-For you? Yes, what do you need?

29:00.321 --> 29:02.532
Is Paul Dilpher a client here?

29:03.616 --> 29:04.492
He is now.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.995
I should have been informed.

29:07.078 --> 29:07.912
Why?

29:07.996 --> 29:10.081
My connections?

29:10.165 --> 29:13.293
Are we supposed to run every client
past junior associates?

29:14.711 --> 29:17.714
Paul Dilpher is in serious legal trouble.

29:17.797 --> 29:20.675
-Which is why he needs a lawyer.
-Linda, my family is involved.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.762
Dilpher is blaming my father.
I know you know all this.

29:23.845 --> 29:26.264
-Do I?
-Isn't this a conflict of interest?

29:26.347 --> 29:29.142
Connor, we have over
150 lawyers in this firm.

29:29.225 --> 29:32.103
You don't think there's ever
a conflict with any of them?

29:32.187 --> 29:34.439
-Well, I suppose--
-So, what do we do?

29:34.522 --> 29:37.942
We build an impermeable firewall
around the lawyer in question.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.570
-That would be me?
-That's right.

29:40.653 --> 29:43.364
You won't be near his case.
And it won't be near you.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.785
Okay. I appreciate that.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.871
We don't want you distracted.
Just focus on the MacLeod case.

29:49.954 --> 29:53.208
We were very impressed with how well
you handled Judge Martinez.

29:54.417 --> 29:55.376
Kudos.

29:58.087 --> 30:01.090
[pensive music playing]

30:04.177 --> 30:05.762
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:05.845 --> 30:08.681
-Kevin, do you have a minute?
-Yeah. What's up?

30:08.765 --> 30:12.477
Well, I'm preparing to teach
this creative writing course and--

30:12.560 --> 30:14.938
Yeah, I know. You, a teacher, right?

30:15.855 --> 30:18.233
No. Sorry, I-- No disrespect.

30:18.316 --> 30:22.028
You're gonna be a great teacher.
You're my little sister.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.280
-I saw you eat mud.
-You gave it to me.

30:24.364 --> 30:28.201
-Just because Abby told me to.
-Can you be an objective audience?

30:28.284 --> 30:29.744
-Yes.
-Okay, great.

30:30.370 --> 30:33.373
Because I've done book signings,
book readings, but this?

30:33.832 --> 30:36.751
This is teaching college students.
Who is more judgmental than college kids?

30:36.835 --> 30:39.838
-You've never been in the Army.
-Can I practice my introduction?

30:39.921 --> 30:40.922
Yeah.

30:41.005 --> 30:41.840
Okay.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.386
Hello, class.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.055
-I'm Bree O'Brien-- You're right.
-[snoring]

30:49.138 --> 30:52.392
-I'm quitting. I'm so boring.
-Come back. Just kidding.

30:53.268 --> 30:56.062
You have to grab their attention, okay?

30:56.145 --> 30:57.730
Shout. Jump up on a desk.

30:57.814 --> 31:00.149
-It's not Dead Poets Society.
-But it could be.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.776
-Okay.
-All right. Go on.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.905
I was gonna start like this.
[clears throat]

31:06.739 --> 31:07.782
"Close the door.

31:08.825 --> 31:11.619
Write as if no one's
looking over your shoulder.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.664
Don't try to figure out what other people
want to hear from you,

31:14.747 --> 31:17.792
figure out what it is
that you have to say.

31:18.710 --> 31:22.046
That is the one and only thing
you have to offer."

31:23.840 --> 31:25.884
Barbara Kingsolver said that.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.261
Bree, that was excellent.

31:28.344 --> 31:30.597
-Really?
-Yeah. You totally hooked me.

31:31.598 --> 31:32.432
Thank you.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.767
Whoo! Okay.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.145
-I owe you.
-Yeah?

31:37.228 --> 31:38.855
-Mm-hm.
-Buy me lunch?

31:38.938 --> 31:39.772
Sure.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.317
Yeah. I know a café that serves great mud.

31:43.526 --> 31:44.360
Yum.

31:46.613 --> 31:49.616
[upbeat music playing]

32:09.928 --> 32:11.846
-Yes?
-Mr. Driscoll?

32:12.805 --> 32:15.141
-I don't wanna bother you--
-Too late.

32:17.185 --> 32:20.438
Well, I'm the woman who called you
about one of your paintings,

32:20.521 --> 32:23.358
and I was just hoping that...

32:24.233 --> 32:26.694
Can you confirm that you painted this?

32:26.778 --> 32:28.404
I'm sorry to say I did.

32:29.614 --> 32:30.490
It's beautiful.

32:30.573 --> 32:32.075
How much did you pay for it?

32:33.159 --> 32:35.662
-Eight dollars.
-You paid too much.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.008
[country music playing over speakers]

32:49.092 --> 32:51.052
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

32:54.055 --> 32:57.058
Hey, Luke, uh,
did the plumbers confirm yet?

32:57.141 --> 32:59.811
Oh, no need.
I was able to clear the main sink.

32:59.894 --> 33:01.980
-Oh, great.
-Hey. Um...

33:02.897 --> 33:04.983
Do you mind if I speak to you?

33:05.066 --> 33:06.109
Yeah, sure.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.112
-Kevin, watch the bar, will you?
-Yeah.

33:14.951 --> 33:19.122
So, Mick, uh, you know I really
appreciate you giving me this job.

33:20.206 --> 33:21.082
But, uh...

33:21.958 --> 33:24.460
I haven't been totally straight with you.

33:24.544 --> 33:25.378
No?

33:26.337 --> 33:27.463
No. I...

33:28.256 --> 33:29.924
I made some mistakes in my past.

33:30.008 --> 33:34.971
They're all behind me,
but I'm still making amends, so to speak.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.598
Okay.

33:37.682 --> 33:42.687
But if I'm to work at The Bridge,
you're gonna have to sign some forms.

33:43.312 --> 33:44.689
What kind of forms?

33:45.398 --> 33:49.694
Just that I work here, you're my employer.
No big deal. Really.

33:49.777 --> 33:52.989
But I didn't do it at my last job,
and it became a thing, and...

33:53.906 --> 33:55.199
I got fired.

33:55.867 --> 33:56.743
I'm listening.

33:57.243 --> 34:03.374
I have a parole officer, and I have
to check in with him once a month.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.001
A parole officer?

34:06.627 --> 34:07.628
Wow.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.382
Look, if it's a problem, it's cool.

34:11.966 --> 34:14.260
I get it. You know, I'm used to it.

34:15.386 --> 34:16.596
Oh, God.

34:17.430 --> 34:21.601
Maybe this is just a really big mistake.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to--

34:21.684 --> 34:23.061
Luke.

34:24.145 --> 34:24.979
Luke!

34:26.064 --> 34:27.690
Hey, Luke! Listen!

34:28.191 --> 34:32.070
Listen, you can't drop a bomb like that
and expect no reaction.

34:32.153 --> 34:33.488
Look, I understand.

34:33.571 --> 34:37.325
-You have every right to be angry.
-I'm not angry, I'm confused.

34:37.408 --> 34:40.536
I work in construction,
I've worked with ex-convicts before.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.872
Some of the best men I know
have done time.

34:42.955 --> 34:44.791
But you've gotta be honest with me.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.087
Will you stop running away and talk to me.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.172
Just tell me what happened.

34:52.173 --> 34:53.007
Okay.

34:54.467 --> 34:57.804
I was supposed to go to college.
I was gonna be a doctor.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.431
My dad died of a heart attack.

35:00.515 --> 35:01.557
And my mom,

35:02.183 --> 35:03.017
she broke.

35:03.976 --> 35:07.105
Someone had to take care of her,
so I got a job in a warehouse.

35:07.188 --> 35:08.606
I'm sorry about your mom.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.358
I let it get to me.

35:11.442 --> 35:12.276
And I...

35:13.236 --> 35:14.320
I started drinking...

35:15.947 --> 35:16.823
too much.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.994
Pretty much the end of the story.

35:22.078 --> 35:24.622
Yeah, except for the going to prison part.

35:26.082 --> 35:27.583
Yeah. Well...

35:29.043 --> 35:31.587
Look, when my mother passed away...

35:33.422 --> 35:35.758
things really started
getting out of control.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.010
I was at a bar, drinking.

35:40.555 --> 35:43.015
This guy, he was just
all up on the waitress.

35:43.933 --> 35:46.602
I told him to-- Told him to back off.

35:47.937 --> 35:50.064
I used harsher language than that.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.652
Anyways, he, uh, slugged me.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.114
And I slugged him back.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.701
Felt like the right thing to do.

36:03.202 --> 36:09.000
He, uh, fell back and he hit his head
on the corner of the bar.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.379
He almost died.

36:15.464 --> 36:16.924
Lucky for you he didn't.

36:17.675 --> 36:20.595
It would have been manslaughter or murder.

36:20.678 --> 36:23.806
But I got three years
for assault and battery,

36:25.183 --> 36:27.185
and one year off for good behavior.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.856
End of story.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.276
Okay.

36:36.903 --> 36:37.862
Now I know.

36:40.698 --> 36:45.244
Listen, Luke, you come in here,
you do your job,

36:45.328 --> 36:48.539
and you and I are gonna
figure this out together, okay?

36:49.624 --> 36:51.000
-You mean that?
-I do.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.502
I sincerely do.

36:53.586 --> 36:56.505
[soft music playing]

36:56.589 --> 37:00.885
Now, I believe, uh...
you have a shift to finish, don't you?

37:05.139 --> 37:05.973
Yeah.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.063
Hey!

37:12.897 --> 37:14.732
-Yeah?
-Don't forget your keys.

37:30.831 --> 37:33.084
-And there you are.
-Hey.

37:34.293 --> 37:35.878
-Care to play through?
-No.

37:35.962 --> 37:40.258
Uh, I spoke with Mandrake, and he said you
were golfing, but wouldn't tell me where.

37:41.425 --> 37:44.553
-This was the last place I could think of.
-Smart of you.

37:44.637 --> 37:47.974
I prefer putt-putt. It's quicker
and the hazards are more entertaining.

37:48.057 --> 37:51.018
-You like being the eccentric millionaire?
-Billionaire.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.938
And I was just as eccentric
when I was poor.

37:54.438 --> 37:57.692
-But then people found me annoying.
-Can't imagine why.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.152
Look, are you pulling out of this deal?

38:00.236 --> 38:02.947
-Why shouldn't I?
-I can give you a hundred reasons.

38:03.030 --> 38:04.573
I only have time for one.

38:04.657 --> 38:09.328
Okay. You're starting your hotel chain,
and this would be your keystone.

38:09.412 --> 38:13.249
Close to D.C., close to Baltimore,
and the coastline is beautiful.

38:13.332 --> 38:15.668
Yeah. It is nice. But the pipes--

38:15.751 --> 38:18.296
Can be dealt with.
I spoke with my soil expert.

38:18.379 --> 38:21.549
The contamination is minimal.
They can dig it out, replace it.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.509
-The cost is...
-Hundred thousand?

38:23.592 --> 38:26.595
-Less than that.
-Huh. And you think I should do it?

38:26.679 --> 38:28.431
I think it would be smart.

38:29.724 --> 38:30.891
I'll tell you what.

38:31.767 --> 38:34.395
If I sink this putt, I'll think it over.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.523
This is how you make your big decisions?

38:37.606 --> 38:39.442
It's how I'm gonna make this one.

38:41.610 --> 38:44.322
What do you know?
I will think it over, Abby.

38:45.823 --> 38:48.284
-Thank you, Mr. Kincaid.
-Evan.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.786
I don't do first names.
It's too complicated.

38:57.251 --> 39:01.172
I'm telling you, Abby was dead-on
about this Baltimore property.

39:01.255 --> 39:02.506
You should make her a partner.

39:02.590 --> 39:05.885
If we get the numbers right,
that lot could be good for you.

39:05.968 --> 39:07.094
Mm-hm.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.889
But I can't believe you don't like
Lowery as the architect.

39:09.972 --> 39:12.183
I can't believe you do.
His designs are terrible.

39:12.266 --> 39:15.227
When we worked on that
medical center in Charlotte,

39:15.311 --> 39:17.897
he was an exquisite pain in the neck.

39:17.980 --> 39:20.566
-Takes one to know one.
-Nonetheless.

39:20.649 --> 39:23.569
-What are you doing?
-Just going through old photo albums.

39:23.652 --> 39:27.073
Trying to find some childhood pics of Jess
that we can use for her wedding.

39:27.156 --> 39:30.159
-[Abby] Embarrassing ones, we hope.
-[Megan] You hope.

39:30.242 --> 39:31.577
Speaking of embarrassing,

39:31.660 --> 39:34.497
would you like to see
your father and uncle as teenagers?

39:34.580 --> 39:36.415
Uh, yes.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.919
Dad, that mullet!

39:40.002 --> 39:42.421
Can't believe I thought
those sideburns looked good.

39:42.505 --> 39:45.049
-My mustache was awesome.
-Not even a little bit.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.176
Are you kidding? I was rocking it.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.804
-[Megan] Look at this.
-[Thomas] Oh, man.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.139
That's the two of us
on the Appalachian Trail.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.101
-Mick, you remember that?
-Of course. '67.

39:55.184 --> 39:57.269
Who could forget? Best trip we ever had.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.438
I agree. It was a fantastic hike.

39:59.522 --> 40:01.357
We had so much fun.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.401
Just us and the wilderness.

40:03.484 --> 40:06.028
I bet you couldn't hike
ten miles of that trail today.

40:06.112 --> 40:08.072
What? Of course we could.

40:08.155 --> 40:10.908
Ten miles? We could do the whole thing.
No problem.

40:10.991 --> 40:12.868
Hm! I'd like to see you try.

40:12.952 --> 40:15.579
Why not? Yeah, it's a good idea.

40:15.663 --> 40:18.624
-You up for that, Mick?
-Sure, if you don't slow me down.

40:18.707 --> 40:21.335
Slow you down?
You were the one with the sore feet.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.045
[Mick] You got the shin splints.

40:23.129 --> 40:26.674
Oh, okay. Okay, let's do this.
For the weekend.

40:26.757 --> 40:30.428
And we can hash out the details
of the project as we hike.

40:30.511 --> 40:34.432
-You still got any camping gear?
-Maybe. I quit camping after that trip.

40:34.515 --> 40:35.891
-[Thomas laughs]
-Let's go look.

40:38.727 --> 40:40.688
-Nice work there, Mom.
-Yep.

40:40.771 --> 40:43.023
Your dad needs to take
some time off from work.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.734
This will either bring
the brothers closer together...

40:45.818 --> 40:47.486
Or they'll kill each other.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.280
-Mm. Time will tell.
-[Abby chuckles]

40:50.448 --> 40:52.616
Oh, honey. Look at this one.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.160
Oh, no, that perm.

40:54.243 --> 40:56.120
-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh! I loved it!

40:56.203 --> 40:59.373
-Don't show that to anyone ever.
-You're poofy but you're cute.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.835
-Who's that?
-Evan Kincaid.

41:02.918 --> 41:06.589
-Really? What's he want?
-He said he's outside.

41:06.672 --> 41:07.673
What?

41:13.596 --> 41:15.097
-Hello.
-Hey!

41:16.724 --> 41:18.601
I wanted to tell you in person.

41:19.393 --> 41:21.687
I've decided to go ahead with the build.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.481
Good. That's good.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.816
-On one condition.
-What's that?

41:26.400 --> 41:28.402
I want you to ride point on the project.

41:30.696 --> 41:32.114
Uh, well...

41:32.823 --> 41:37.536
uh, you know, my dad is really the one
who does the construction side of things.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.496
That's true.

41:38.579 --> 41:41.582
But you have a quality
that I value more than that.

41:41.665 --> 41:42.917
What is that?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.460
You don't like me.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.631
-Pardon?
-You won't tell me what I wanna hear.

41:48.714 --> 41:51.967
You'll give me the facts. You don't know
how rare that is in my line of work.

41:52.051 --> 41:55.513
-Your line of work?
-Being a billionaire. It's exhausting.

41:55.596 --> 41:59.099
Everybody wants me to like them
because they wanna get something from me.

41:59.183 --> 42:02.728
-Well, I don't think that is true.
-See? You don't like me.

42:02.811 --> 42:04.563
And I don't particularly like you.

42:04.647 --> 42:08.275
We won't worry about offending each other
because we're already offended.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.611
It's the perfect working relationship.

42:13.739 --> 42:15.950
Yeah, you know, somehow that makes sense.

42:16.033 --> 42:16.992
Doesn't it?

42:19.036 --> 42:22.206
All right.
Well, then, good night, Mr. Kincaid.

42:23.499 --> 42:26.752
I would invite you in,
but I don't want to.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.089
This is gonna be great.

42:33.092 --> 42:36.095

[narrator] Next on Chesapeake Shores:

44:06.644 --> 44:09.897
The Snallygaster,
the mythical beast of the Maryland woods.

44:09.980 --> 44:11.231
[Jess] Did you hear that?

44:11.315 --> 44:12.983
I don't think it was
down this steep a hill.

44:13.067 --> 44:14.401
We can make it. Down there.

44:14.485 --> 44:15.694
Tommy!

44:15.778 --> 44:19.281
You might not wanna leave any documents
overnight for anyone to see.

44:19.365 --> 44:22.701
Look at the signature. Dad couldn't
have signed this. He was in Florida.

44:22.785 --> 44:24.328
Chili is served.

44:24.411 --> 44:26.288
Did he use this instead of salt?

44:26.372 --> 44:28.999
If you don't tell them,
it's a violation of your parole.

44:29.083 --> 44:29.917
Understood, sir.
