00:38.540 --> 00:40.875
OK, I'll go first.

00:41.459 --> 00:44.212
Let me say, we don't really need to be here.

00:45.422 --> 00:48.633
- See, we've been married five years.
- Six.

00:48.717 --> 00:53.638
Five, six years.
And this is like a check-up for us.

00:54.639 --> 00:59.603
Chance to poke around the engine,
maybe change the oil.

00:59.686 --> 01:03.773
- Replace a seal or two.
- Yeah, that's it.

01:04.733 --> 01:07.110
Very well, then. Let's pop the hood.

01:09.029 --> 01:11.489
On a scale of one to ten,
how happy a couple are you?

01:11.573 --> 01:13.867
- Eight.
- Wait.

01:13.950 --> 01:18.371
Ten being perfectly happy
and one being totally miserable, or...

01:18.455 --> 01:21.625
- Just respond instinctively.
- OK.

01:22.626 --> 01:24.085
Ready?

01:24.169 --> 01:25.503
Eight.

01:28.548 --> 01:31.217
How often do you have sex?

01:31.301 --> 01:34.262
I don't understand the question.

01:34.346 --> 01:37.307
Yeah, I'm lost. Is this a one to ten thing?

01:37.390 --> 01:41.519
But, because, is, like, one very little,
or is one nothing? Because...

01:41.603 --> 01:46.066
You know, technically speaking,
the zero would be nothing.

01:50.070 --> 01:52.405
How about this week?

01:55.951 --> 01:58.536
- Including the weekend?
- Sure.

02:04.751 --> 02:07.254
Describe how you first met.

02:07.337 --> 02:11.299
- It was in Colombia.
- Bogotá.

02:11.383 --> 02:13.510
Five years ago.

02:13.593 --> 02:15.220
Six.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.639
Right. Five or six years ago.

02:33.238 --> 02:35.407
<i>... todas las habitaciones.</i>

02:36.324 --> 02:37.951
<i>Hey. ¿ Qué pasa?</i>

02:42.747 --> 02:48.753
<i>Vamos, muchachos.
Registren los elevadores y los escalones.</i>

02:53.258 --> 02:55.010
<i>¿Anda solo?</i>

02:58.680 --> 03:00.390
<i>Papeles.</i>

03:00.473 --> 03:01.933
<i>Señora.</i>

03:07.522 --> 03:09.608
<i>- ¿Está sola?
- No.</i>

03:11.526 --> 03:14.237
<i>- No, no, no, no, no.
- Está bien.</i>

03:14.321 --> 03:17.115
<i>She's with me. Está bien.</i>

03:19.242 --> 03:21.995
<i>Abren. Sus papeles.</i>

03:26.249 --> 03:28.460
I'm Jane.

03:29.461 --> 03:32.005
- John.
- Nice to meet you.

03:32.088 --> 03:34.424
Nice to meet you.

03:38.136 --> 03:41.181
- To dodging bullets.
- Dodging bullets.

03:46.603 --> 03:49.022
So it speaks.

03:49.105 --> 03:51.399
But does it dance?

05:38.757 --> 05:40.967
Hiya, stranger.

05:41.051 --> 05:43.428
Hiya back.

05:44.971 --> 05:47.182
I think room service fled.

05:47.265 --> 05:49.893
I did what I could.

05:49.976 --> 05:52.312
Thank you.

05:55.273 --> 05:57.567
Oh, that's good.

05:57.651 --> 06:00.946
I hope so. I had to milk a goat to get it.

06:37.816 --> 06:41.695
Hey, step right up,
ladies and gentlemen. Try your luck.

06:41.778 --> 06:46.533
How about you, little lady?
Wanna try your luck? Win a prize?

06:46.616 --> 06:48.994
Yeah, all right.

06:51.329 --> 06:54.624
- Two.
- We got two over here.

06:55.542 --> 06:58.753
- You know how to hold it?
- Step right up, have a shot.

06:58.837 --> 06:59.838
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

06:59.921 --> 07:01.923
Yeah.

07:04.259 --> 07:06.678
- You gotta aim it.
- I am.

07:07.637 --> 07:10.015
Don't laugh, I'll kill you.

07:11.266 --> 07:13.727
You didn't blink.

07:20.317 --> 07:22.777
Do we still get something?

07:22.861 --> 07:25.155
Beginner's luck.

07:26.072 --> 07:29.242
- I want to go again.
- Going again.

07:40.795 --> 07:43.924
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

07:44.007 --> 07:46.301
Beginner's luck.

07:48.386 --> 07:51.556
Stop. Stop,
you've only known the girl for six weeks.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.476
I'm in love. She's smart, sexy.

07:55.018 --> 08:00.899
She's uninhibited, spontaneous, complicated.
She's the sweetest thing I've ever seen.

08:00.982 --> 08:04.027
I knew Gladys two and a half years
before I asked her to marry me.

08:04.110 --> 08:10.075
You have to have a foundation of friendship,
brother. The other stuff fades.

08:10.158 --> 08:11.201
Hi.

08:17.582 --> 08:21.044
So you don't think
this is all happening a little fast?

08:21.127 --> 08:24.130
You know I never do anything
without thinking it through.

08:24.214 --> 08:29.719
- What does he do?
- He's in construction. Big-time contractor.

08:29.803 --> 08:35.392
A server goes down on Wall Street.
She's there, anytime, day or night.

08:38.144 --> 08:40.438
She's like Batman for computers.

08:40.522 --> 08:44.359
He's gone as much as I am, so it's perfect.

08:45.860 --> 08:48.530
I give the whole thing six months, tops.

08:48.613 --> 08:50.448
Eddie?

08:50.532 --> 08:52.784
I asked her to marry me.

08:52.867 --> 08:54.744
What?

08:54.828 --> 08:58.456
- I'm getting married!
- What? I can't hear you.

08:58.915 --> 09:00.667
- Getting married.
- I can't hear.

09:00.750 --> 09:04.170
- Stop hitting him, he said something crazy.
- I'm getting married.

09:45.921 --> 09:49.382
- Gotta get these filters changed.
- What did you think of Dr Wexler?

09:49.466 --> 09:52.093
His questions were a bit wishy-washy.

09:52.177 --> 09:56.014
Yeah. Watch your arm.
Not the most insightful.

09:57.015 --> 09:59.267
And his office is clear across town.

09:59.351 --> 10:04.856
Well, you know the four o'clock means
we hit rush hour. Not crazy about that.

10:04.940 --> 10:07.525
- So that's settled then, yeah?
- OK.

10:11.863 --> 10:12.906
OK.

10:12.989 --> 10:15.033
Dinner's at seven.

10:15.116 --> 10:17.452
Yup. I'll be there. Here.

10:41.559 --> 10:44.771
Anybody calls,
I'm in with the boss. OK?

10:44.854 --> 10:49.067
Got a call from the man. Big highline
assignment, Steve. You know how it is.

10:49.150 --> 10:51.444
Actually, you probably don't.
Sweetie?

10:51.528 --> 10:55.198
Could you grab me a coffee?
I like it with lots of sugar. Thanks a lot.

10:55.282 --> 10:57.617
Hey there.

11:00.996 --> 11:03.206
And where do you think you're going?

11:03.290 --> 11:07.043
Well, I was... The boss wants to see me.

11:07.127 --> 11:09.170
Well, he sees you.

11:10.130 --> 11:13.717
<i>Look, kid, people who've been
working here for 25 years</i>

11:13.800 --> 11:16.094
have never seen inside of that elevator.

11:16.177 --> 11:18.096
Here.

11:23.268 --> 11:25.437
This is the assignment?

11:25.520 --> 11:27.897
Now get outta here.

12:22.702 --> 12:24.788
- Hey, babe.
- Perfect timing.

12:24.871 --> 12:27.207
It's pissing rain out there.

12:29.501 --> 12:32.170
Gardener left the lawnmower out.

12:36.675 --> 12:38.802
- How was work?
- Ah, so-so.

12:38.885 --> 12:41.096
Oh, I got new curtains.

12:41.179 --> 12:43.014
Did you?

12:44.474 --> 12:45.850
Well?

12:47.852 --> 12:50.272
What do you think?

12:55.026 --> 12:58.363
There was a struggle over the material.
This tea sandwich of a man,

12:58.446 --> 13:00.448
he got his hands on them first.

13:00.532 --> 13:02.534
- But I won.
- Of course you did.

13:02.617 --> 13:07.330
They're a bit green, so we have to reupholster
the sofas and get a new rug. Maybe a Persian.

13:07.414 --> 13:12.669
Yeah, or we can just keep the old ones,
then we don't have to change a thing.

13:12.752 --> 13:15.672
We talked about this. You remember?

13:18.967 --> 13:22.512
I remember.
I remember cos we said we'd wait.

13:23.847 --> 13:27.058
If you don't like 'em, we can take 'em back.

13:27.142 --> 13:30.270
OK. I don't like 'em.

13:30.353 --> 13:33.481
You'll get used to 'em.

13:33.565 --> 13:34.941
Yeah.

14:08.141 --> 14:11.269
Zero per cent APR till March.

14:14.105 --> 14:16.399
So, part two. Here we are.

14:16.483 --> 14:19.736
Only this time, you came back alone.
Why did you come back?

14:19.819 --> 14:22.113
I'm not sure, really.

14:23.031 --> 14:25.408
Let me clarify, I love my wife.

14:26.952 --> 14:29.246
I want her to be happy.

14:29.329 --> 14:31.665
I want good things for her.

14:32.916 --> 14:35.252
But there are times...

14:54.604 --> 14:57.732
- Honey, would you just...
- Five more minutes.

14:59.192 --> 15:02.070
There's this huge space between us.

15:02.153 --> 15:07.867
And it just keeps filling up with
everything that we don't say to each other.

15:07.951 --> 15:11.079
- What is that called?
- Marriage.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.708
What don't you say to each other?

15:20.797 --> 15:23.842
<i>James of the Yukon got three stars.</i>

15:24.718 --> 15:27.804
This looks nice.
Did you do something new?

15:28.763 --> 15:30.724
Yeah?

15:30.807 --> 15:34.436
- I added peas.
- Yeah, peas.

15:36.813 --> 15:39.774
Yeah, it's the green.

15:41.443 --> 15:43.653
Sweetheart, will you pass the salt?

15:43.737 --> 15:46.406
It's in the middle of the table.

15:47.365 --> 15:52.787
- Is that the middle of the table?
- Yeah, it's between you and me.

15:55.457 --> 15:58.627
- How honest are you with him?
- Pretty honest.

15:58.710 --> 16:00.170
I mean...

16:00.253 --> 16:04.341
It's not like I lie to him or anything.
We just...

16:04.424 --> 16:08.219
I have little secrets.
Everybody has secrets.

16:29.491 --> 16:32.452
Jesus! Honey, you scared me.

16:32.535 --> 16:35.830
I'm sorry, hon. I was looking for the...

16:36.831 --> 16:38.875
You going out?

16:38.959 --> 16:44.005
Yes. Some clown crashed a server in a law
firm downtown and ended the world, so yes.

16:47.217 --> 16:49.803
We promised the Colemans.

16:49.886 --> 16:51.346
- I know.
- OK.

16:51.429 --> 16:54.975
I'll be there. In and out. Just a quickie.

17:04.276 --> 17:07.820
Probably feels like
you're the only people going through this,

17:07.904 --> 17:13.201
but there are millions of couples
that are experiencing the same problems.

17:56.244 --> 17:59.664
- We got a plane in an hour.
- All right.

17:59.748 --> 18:03.877
- Who's Al Gore? "Quotes", 800.
- Prodded about possible insider trading,

18:03.960 --> 18:08.465
she remarked on national television,
"I want to focus on my salad." Ryan?

18:08.548 --> 18:10.550
- Martha Stewart.
- Martha Stewart?

18:10.634 --> 18:14.262
- "Quotes" for 1000.
- Regarding Mick Jagger's knighthood,

18:14.346 --> 18:19.059
he scoffed, "It's a paltry honour, mate.
Hold out for the lordship."

18:40.956 --> 18:45.252
- 40.
- All right. I'll match you...

18:45.335 --> 18:48.046
What the hell?
What's this shite?

18:48.129 --> 18:52.926
Sorry. Where's the can around here?
Chrissake...

18:53.009 --> 18:55.345
Take a... Hey, you guys playing poker?

18:55.428 --> 18:59.349
- Private game. Piss off.
- Could I sit in? You think I could...

18:59.432 --> 19:01.977
What part of "piss off'
do you not understand?

19:02.060 --> 19:05.063
Guys... Whoa, be a little friendly.
I got the cash...

19:05.146 --> 19:07.274
Easy, big feller.

19:07.983 --> 19:10.777
That's cool, man. You're cool.

19:10.860 --> 19:13.780
Lis... Look, see?
You see what I'm saying?

19:13.863 --> 19:17.701
See what I'm saying?
Anyone interested?

19:17.784 --> 19:21.955
Nah. Cos I'll clean you out.
I understand. Fine.

19:22.956 --> 19:26.585
Listen, I want...
Those are really nice shoes, man.

19:30.088 --> 19:31.881
Jesus!

19:31.965 --> 19:35.594
- Here's an empty chair. I could sit here...
- That is Lucky's chair.

19:35.677 --> 19:38.138
Where's Lucky? I don't see Lucky.

19:38.221 --> 19:41.641
- Lucky's not back yet.
- Then I'll sit here.

19:41.725 --> 19:43.852
Unless...

19:43.935 --> 19:45.979
I'm too hot for you.

20:25.518 --> 20:28.647
- Solid silver.
- Ooh, very sweet.

20:30.148 --> 20:32.359
"To dodging bullets. Love, Jane."

20:32.442 --> 20:34.736
In the pot. Put it in the pot.

20:36.363 --> 20:39.115
Oh, he's pulled something.

20:39.199 --> 20:40.575
You're in trouble now.

20:40.659 --> 20:44.246
- $60, eh?
- In.

20:45.497 --> 20:49.542
Look at the big man over there!

20:49.626 --> 20:51.962
Let's play some poker!

20:53.713 --> 20:56.383
- Fives.
- He's got 14 different tells!

20:56.466 --> 20:58.677
You are bleeding William Tell.

21:04.182 --> 21:07.018
- What the hell is this?
- Sorry, Lucky.

21:07.102 --> 21:09.521
You're done, pal.
Thanks for the memories.

21:09.604 --> 21:11.856
Oh, you Lucky? No kidding.

21:11.940 --> 21:14.567
What is it, kid?
You looking for ajob or something?

21:14.651 --> 21:16.695
You are the job.

21:32.168 --> 21:34.546
Pair of threes.

21:39.467 --> 21:41.761
- Have you been a bad boy?
- Yes.

21:46.850 --> 21:50.103
You know what happens to bad boys?

21:51.605 --> 21:55.108
- They get punished.
- Ooh, yeah. Punish me.

21:59.195 --> 22:02.365
Have you been selling
big guns to bad people?

22:10.248 --> 22:12.417
Mister Racin?

22:13.293 --> 22:15.629
Mister Racin? You OK?

22:17.213 --> 22:19.591
Oh, the Colemans.

22:24.512 --> 22:27.307
He's down!

22:44.783 --> 22:47.118
Taxi?

23:07.347 --> 23:12.394
- Hey, hon.
- Hey, baby. I didn't hear you downstairs.

23:12.477 --> 23:15.897
Yeah, I went to the sports bar.
Put some money on the game.

23:15.981 --> 23:18.692
Yeah? How'd you do?

23:18.775 --> 23:21.111
I got lucky.

23:24.990 --> 23:27.659
Welcome, neighbours!

23:27.742 --> 23:30.203
- Hi, Susan.
- Good to see you, John.

23:30.287 --> 23:32.539
- There you go.
- Oh, this is wonderful.

23:32.622 --> 23:35.417
Thank you.

23:35.500 --> 23:39.421
- What a lovely dress.
- Thank you very much. So is yours.

23:40.422 --> 23:44.092
- Come on, let's go see the girls.
- Don't stray too far, guys.

23:44.175 --> 23:46.177
You want a Cuban?

23:46.261 --> 23:48.638
No, I don't smoke.

23:48.722 --> 23:51.725
- Clean body, clean soul, Suzy says.
- Ain't that the truth.

23:51.808 --> 23:54.311
- You guys have any vices?
- Well, you know.

23:54.394 --> 23:58.064
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yes. Chardonnay, please.

23:59.733 --> 24:01.401
- Girls?
- Chardonnay.

24:01.484 --> 24:06.197
- Daddy!
- I'll be up here at the filling station.

24:06.281 --> 24:08.825
<i>- ...stock's getting butchered.
- Hey, boys. Scotch?</i>

24:08.909 --> 24:11.286
- Yes, sir.
- It's a bloodbath over there.

24:11.369 --> 24:13.747
How'd you make out last quarter?
Take a beating?

24:13.830 --> 24:18.001
Actually, I got all my dough
buried under the tool shed.

24:18.084 --> 24:22.631
- So, Chuck got the promotion.
- Oh, my God, that is so great.

24:22.714 --> 24:25.759
So excited. We can finally
put the addition on the kitchen.

24:25.842 --> 24:28.553
Oh, shoot. Not again.

24:28.637 --> 24:31.306
Shoulda worn a raincoat.

24:31.389 --> 24:34.809
You know what? Would...
Can you hold her for a second?

24:34.893 --> 24:37.395
- What? No...
- It's all over the appliqué.

24:37.479 --> 24:40.023
- Oh, no, I...
- No, please, just...

24:40.106 --> 24:42.400
Sure.

24:44.152 --> 24:46.655
Seltzer.

24:48.907 --> 24:51.743
Aw, she likes you.

25:04.798 --> 25:07.926
I liked your dress tonight.

25:08.009 --> 25:10.345
It was nice.

25:10.428 --> 25:12.764
Thank you.

26:42.812 --> 26:46.316
Good morning, Mr Smith.
There's trouble in Atlanta again.

26:46.399 --> 26:50.946
- That's what I hear. What you got?
- I've got your boarding pass, taxi receipts...

26:51.029 --> 26:53.365
Get rid of that gum.

26:53.448 --> 26:56.493
- You got a tissue?
- And your hotel bill.

26:56.576 --> 26:59.621
- Thanks.
- Don't lose those. Keep them in the envelope.

26:59.704 --> 27:01.706
We've got the new specs for the dam.

27:01.790 --> 27:04.292
- Great, Louie. I'll check those out.
- Here.

27:04.376 --> 27:08.338
- Is Eddie here?
- The door's unlocked.

27:08.421 --> 27:10.799
- Morning, pal.
- How you doing?

27:10.882 --> 27:13.677
Same old same old.
People need killing.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.387
Oh, Johnny.

27:15.470 --> 27:18.223
Little get-together this weekend at my house.

27:18.306 --> 27:22.018
Barbecue, no ladies, dudes only.
It's gonna be awesome.

27:22.102 --> 27:24.437
Yeah, I'll talk to the missus.

27:24.521 --> 27:27.232
You want to use my cellphone?
Maybe give her a call,

27:27.315 --> 27:30.610
in case you decide to scratch your ass
or use the head later.

27:30.694 --> 27:34.614
- Make sure she thinks it's OK.
- You live with your mother.

27:34.698 --> 27:37.659
Why bring her into this?
She's a first-class lady.

27:37.742 --> 27:42.497
And I don't have to check in with her when I
want to do something. She cooks, she cleans.

27:42.581 --> 27:45.542
She makes me snacks.
I'm the dumb guy?

28:02.309 --> 28:04.311
John Smith.

28:07.981 --> 28:11.276
- Hello, John.
- Morning, Atlanta.

28:11.359 --> 28:16.656
Quite the body count this week. We have
a priority one, so I need your expertise.

28:16.740 --> 28:21.536
The target's name is Benjamin Danz,
aka "The Tank".

28:22.037 --> 28:26.124
He's a direct threat to the firm.
DIA custody.

28:26.207 --> 28:31.755
They're making a ground-to-air handoff
to heli, ten miles north of the Mexican border.

28:31.838 --> 28:35.634
I need you to make sure
the target does not change hands.

28:35.717 --> 28:37.010
"The Tank"?

29:00.242 --> 29:03.161
- I-Temp technology...
- Jane Smith confirmed.

29:03.245 --> 29:05.580
Stand by for contact.

29:05.664 --> 29:08.083
Sorry to interrupt, but we have a situation.

29:08.166 --> 29:12.879
You know the competition would love to see
us burn. I need you to handle this personally.

29:12.963 --> 29:15.090
- Target?
- Benjamin Danz.

29:15.173 --> 29:19.761
I'm rolling the specs now.
We need this quick, clean, and contained.

29:19.844 --> 29:20.971
Yes, sir.

29:29.437 --> 29:31.273
- Ladies.
- Morning.

29:31.356 --> 29:33.108
- Morning.
- Hello, Jane.

29:35.110 --> 29:38.196
Yesterday's op: One kill,
one agent in protective custody.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.824
- We'll get him out tomorrow.
- Two cases of G-40s.

29:40.907 --> 29:43.243
- The grenade launchers are here.
- Order more.

29:43.326 --> 29:45.537
All right. Go, Jas.

29:45.620 --> 29:48.665
The target's name is Benjamin Danz,
aka "The Tank".

29:48.748 --> 29:50.709
- You serious?
- Yeah.

29:50.792 --> 29:53.670
He's being moved across the border
to a federal facility.

29:53.753 --> 29:57.716
The only point of vulnerability
is just south of the border.

29:57.799 --> 30:02.220
I want GPS and SAC of the canyon,
and the weather report for the last three days.

30:03.555 --> 30:09.561
He'll rendezvous with the helicopter at a
deserted airstrip. We've one chance to strike.

30:12.355 --> 30:14.649
Oh, look. More desert.

30:46.890 --> 30:50.769
- Are we green?
- Perimeter is armed. We are up and running.

31:04.324 --> 31:08.245
Red team, red team, this is Broadway Joe.
Half-time is approaching.

31:08.328 --> 31:10.664
Copy that, Broadway Joe.

31:46.199 --> 31:48.535
Oh, come on...

31:56.710 --> 32:00.922
- You getting this?
- Affirmative. Is it a threat?

32:03.592 --> 32:06.761
Countdown's initiated.
The convoy is not in the zone yet.

32:06.845 --> 32:09.472
An idiot's in the field.
He'll blow the charges.

32:32.913 --> 32:34.956
OK.

32:42.756 --> 32:45.091
You gotta be kidding me.

32:48.386 --> 32:50.221
Civilians.

33:02.943 --> 33:05.445
Let's get a tune out of this trombone.

33:10.158 --> 33:12.244
Picking up a weapon signature.

33:12.327 --> 33:14.621
Shit. Not a civilian.

33:17.499 --> 33:19.709
Aw, man...

33:19.793 --> 33:20.794
Asshole.

33:31.054 --> 33:33.139
Countdown is initiated.

33:56.830 --> 33:59.332
You should so not be allowed
to buy these things.

34:08.091 --> 34:09.342
Abort!

34:51.009 --> 34:54.094
I think I got ID'd on that hit.
You ever been ID'd on a hit?

34:54.179 --> 34:57.349
- Not that I'm aware of, no.
- Right. I'm in trouble.

34:57.432 --> 35:02.312
- You get a look at him?
- Little thing. Buck ten, buck fifteen tops.

35:02.395 --> 35:05.065
Maybe he's Filipino.

35:05.148 --> 35:07.484
I'm not even sure it was a him.

35:09.152 --> 35:12.239
You saying that you had
your ass handed to you by some girl?

35:12.322 --> 35:14.950
I think so. A pro.

35:16.660 --> 35:21.164
Well, it shouldn't be that difficult. I mean,
how many chicks are hitters out there?

35:21.248 --> 35:24.167
- You guys want any dessert?
- What do you have, honey?

35:24.251 --> 35:27.420
- Ice cream.
- Delicious. What flavours?

35:27.504 --> 35:30.215
- Chocolate and vanilla.
- I don't like those.

35:30.298 --> 35:33.927
But mixed together,
that could be nice, you know what I mean?

35:34.010 --> 35:37.764
And not just the little pink spoon,
I like the whole sundae.

35:37.847 --> 35:39.891
- That could be arranged.
- Perfect.

35:39.975 --> 35:44.813
"Could be arranged." You hear that? I'd like
to have her kick my ass, know what I mean?

35:44.896 --> 35:48.608
- Any other details besides her weight class?
- Laptop.

35:48.692 --> 35:50.860
Sorry? You're in a whole zone right now...

35:50.944 --> 35:52.779
- Laptop.
- OK, laptop.

35:53.196 --> 35:55.991
I want to know who that bitch is.
Get me that tape.

35:56.074 --> 35:58.785
- Jane.
- Get me that tape.

35:58.868 --> 36:01.204
- What?
- It's Father.

36:08.003 --> 36:11.339
The FBI secured the package.
The window's closed, sir.

36:11.423 --> 36:15.010
- I told you we couldn't afford mistakes.
- There was another player.

36:15.093 --> 36:21.808
We do not leave witnesses.
If this player ID'd you... You know the rules.

36:21.891 --> 36:24.853
You have 48 hours to clean the scene, Jane.

36:24.936 --> 36:27.272
Looking forward to it, sir.

36:30.191 --> 36:34.195
All right, we have a new target.
Let's find out who he is.

36:36.281 --> 36:39.743
Jesus... What did you do to it?

36:40.160 --> 36:42.787
Put a campfire out with it?

36:42.871 --> 36:45.081
Buy a new one.

36:45.165 --> 36:48.627
This one has sentimental value for its owner.

36:48.710 --> 36:53.131
- Who's that?
- Well, Gwen, I'm just hoping you can tell me.

36:54.716 --> 36:58.303
So, why you gotta know so bad, anyway?

36:59.304 --> 37:02.057
You know, just trying
to return some lost property.

37:02.140 --> 37:05.060
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, John.

37:06.019 --> 37:08.521
- You a vegan?
- No.

37:08.605 --> 37:10.774
My girlfriend is.

37:12.442 --> 37:14.861
Here we go.

37:14.945 --> 37:18.031
Upgraded RAM module.

37:21.159 --> 37:23.286
Chip's Chinese.

37:23.370 --> 37:28.250
Imported by Dynamix. Retailed by...

37:29.960 --> 37:34.756
You know, I might be able
to get you a billing address.

37:34.839 --> 37:37.634
All right? No name, just an address.

37:37.717 --> 37:42.222
<i>570 Lexington Avenue, Suite 5003.</i>

37:42.305 --> 37:44.391
New York.

37:44.474 --> 37:46.810
You know the place?

38:22.637 --> 38:25.056
Sweet Jesus! Mother of God...

38:43.283 --> 38:46.369
Why don't you both go make some coffee?

39:07.015 --> 39:09.726
Jane, it's your husband.

39:10.936 --> 39:15.941
He's back from Atlanta
and he wants to know about dinner.

39:16.024 --> 39:19.069
Tell him... Dinner's at seven.

39:19.569 --> 39:23.490
Hi, John.
Yeah, she says dinner's at seven.

39:23.573 --> 39:25.909
It always is.

40:35.895 --> 40:38.023
Perfect timing.

40:38.106 --> 40:40.901
As always.

40:45.113 --> 40:48.074
- This is a nice surprise.
- I hope so.

40:48.158 --> 40:51.202
- You're home early.
- I missed you.

40:52.245 --> 40:54.664
I missed you, too.

40:54.748 --> 40:57.250
- Shall we?
- Yes.

41:11.139 --> 41:16.311
- Thought these were for special occasions.
- This is a special occasion.

41:47.217 --> 41:50.011
Pot roast. My favourite.

41:54.099 --> 41:56.643
Allow me, sweetheart.

41:56.726 --> 41:59.020
Been on your feet all day.

41:59.104 --> 42:01.231
Thank you.

42:01.314 --> 42:03.650
Sure.

42:18.373 --> 42:21.251
So how's work?

42:23.378 --> 42:27.007
Actually, we had a little trouble
with a commission.

42:27.090 --> 42:29.134
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

42:30.218 --> 42:33.680
Double booking with another firm.

42:33.763 --> 42:36.433
- Green beans?
- No, thank you.

42:36.516 --> 42:38.852
You'll have some.

42:42.814 --> 42:44.983
Well, I hope everything worked out OK.

42:45.066 --> 42:47.110
It hasn't yet.

42:47.193 --> 42:50.071
But it will.

42:57.454 --> 42:59.915
Pot roast is my favourite.

42:59.998 --> 43:02.918
Sweetheart, could you pass the salt?

43:39.746 --> 43:42.165
Tried something new?

43:59.224 --> 44:01.351
How was Atlanta?

44:02.310 --> 44:07.065
Had a few problems ourselves.
Some figures didn't add up.

44:07.148 --> 44:09.943
- Big deal?
- Life or death. Wine?

44:34.134 --> 44:36.344
- I got it.
- I'll get a towel.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.442
Janie?

44:53.987 --> 44:56.072
Honey?

45:04.039 --> 45:05.957
Jane!

45:12.547 --> 45:14.257
Jane!

45:17.510 --> 45:19.554
How could I be so stupid?

45:30.649 --> 45:32.067
Jane!

45:32.150 --> 45:34.152
Jane!

45:53.421 --> 45:55.924
Oh, dear God...

46:03.598 --> 46:06.184
Wait. No, no. Accident.

46:06.268 --> 46:08.520
Honey? Accident.

46:08.603 --> 46:11.439
Jane, stop the car, now.

46:12.315 --> 46:14.526
Jane?

46:14.609 --> 46:16.611
You're overreacting.

46:17.821 --> 46:19.906
Let's not get carried away.

46:19.990 --> 46:22.742
We don't want to go to sleep angry.
We can talk this out.

46:22.826 --> 46:24.035
God!

46:24.119 --> 46:25.870
Pull over.

46:25.954 --> 46:28.582
Pull over! Pull over!

46:30.792 --> 46:32.752
Now, look...

46:37.716 --> 46:40.051
We need to talk!

46:50.562 --> 46:54.733
- OK, I'm coming. Who is it?
- Open up.

46:57.068 --> 47:00.155
- What the hell happened to you?
- My wife.

47:06.369 --> 47:08.955
- She tried to kill me.
- Yes. And you know what?

47:09.039 --> 47:13.418
Gladys tried to kill me. Not with a car.
At least Jane was a man about it.

47:13.501 --> 47:18.965
But they all try to kill you. Slowly, painfully,
cripplingly. And then, wham! They hurt you.

47:19.049 --> 47:22.594
You know how hurt I used to be?
I used to beat myself up. Now I'm great.

47:22.677 --> 47:26.056
I got dates all the time.
I just woke up from a thing, I'm in my robe.

47:26.139 --> 47:28.224
- You live with your mom.
- I choose to.

47:28.308 --> 47:32.228
Because that's the only woman
I've ever trusted.

47:34.397 --> 47:37.901
- It's unbelievable.
- Look, I know exactly what you're thinking.

47:37.984 --> 47:41.029
If she lied about that,
what else has she lied about?

47:41.112 --> 47:44.324
I mean, herjob is a spy,
to get information from people.

47:44.407 --> 47:49.329
French Riviera. A yacht. An Iranian prince.

47:49.412 --> 47:53.959
She's supposed to get close to him
and gain his trust. It's disgusting.

47:54.042 --> 47:56.127
What? What are you saying?

47:56.211 --> 48:00.173
What? Your husband is the shooter?

48:00.257 --> 48:02.592
That's impossible.

48:03.969 --> 48:05.095
Really?

48:05.178 --> 48:09.266
This was probably planned from
the beginning. Operation Stakeout Johnny.

48:09.349 --> 48:14.187
A six-year stakeout to get information
from you. Mission accomplished.

48:16.731 --> 48:18.191
OK.

48:19.192 --> 48:21.444
Here's the upside.

48:21.528 --> 48:23.530
- You don't love him.
- No.

48:23.613 --> 48:28.076
You'll kill him, and nobody's
better at that than you are.

48:28.159 --> 48:31.621
- Thank you.
- And then it'll be over.

48:37.711 --> 48:41.548
Lookit, I know you're embarrassed,
but it's Eddie you're talking to.

48:41.631 --> 48:44.968
The guys we work with,
they don't know, I'm never gonna tell 'em.

48:45.051 --> 48:49.931
The people she works with probably got
a big laugh over this, but that's not important.

48:50.015 --> 48:53.768
<i>Lookit, it's like 150 pages
of a book have been written.</i>

48:53.852 --> 48:57.606
<i>In the first 150 pages, Johnny's been a clown.</i>

48:57.689 --> 49:04.446
Well, you can write the last ten pages. You
been smoked, but you can write the last ten.

49:04.529 --> 49:08.450
Great talk, man. We should do it more often.
It was great, I'm proud of you.

49:08.533 --> 49:11.745
- I'm gonna borrow this.
- I like where your head's at, man.

49:11.828 --> 49:13.830
- I'll do it in the morning.
- Yeah.

49:15.373 --> 49:16.708
- You OK?
- Yeah.

49:16.791 --> 49:19.502
- OK. Good night.
- Night.

49:34.893 --> 49:36.853
You don't love him.

49:36.937 --> 49:39.898
- Night, Johnny.
- Night, Eddie.

49:39.981 --> 49:42.317
Good night, Mom.

50:30.282 --> 50:31.950
OK, girls. Let's go.

50:32.033 --> 50:35.745
Pocket litter, receipts, matchbooks.
You know the drill.

50:54.848 --> 50:58.184
This is nice. Who picked this out?

51:00.770 --> 51:03.398
- What is this?
- It looks like your wedding.

51:03.481 --> 51:06.985
- I know what it is. What are you doing?
- Research on the target.

51:07.068 --> 51:09.446
This room is wrapped. Thank you.

51:10.530 --> 51:16.745
<i>...to have and to hold,
to love and to cherish, till death do us part.</i>

51:16.828 --> 51:19.414
I promise.

51:19.497 --> 51:24.753
I, John, take you, Jane, to be my lawfully
wedded wife, to have and to h...

51:32.469 --> 51:34.804
What's going on, Mrs Smith?

51:35.764 --> 51:37.223
Garden party, girls.

51:46.191 --> 51:49.069
Howdy, neighbour.

51:55.450 --> 51:59.996
Wow. I can't believe I've never
been in here before. This is great.

52:00.080 --> 52:03.500
- Start with the living room.
- Oh, yeah.

52:03.583 --> 52:08.755
- I love the floors. What are they, teak?
- Red oak, Martin. Red oak.

52:09.673 --> 52:14.552
And you won the Golf Masters trophy
this year.

52:14.636 --> 52:18.139
- Again.
- Again. That'll be on your mantel next year.

52:49.629 --> 52:50.922
Bitch.

52:55.885 --> 52:58.471
Target profile is our main priority.

52:59.472 --> 53:01.516
Utilise all means necessary.

53:01.600 --> 53:05.729
Phone taps. Credit cards.
Audio scan civilian frequencies.

53:05.812 --> 53:08.148
With what, Jane?

53:10.275 --> 53:13.445
You've reached the Smiths.
We can't take your call,

53:13.528 --> 53:16.948
but leave a message after the tone
and we'll get back to you.

53:17.032 --> 53:21.328
- And search the database.
- For what? John Smith?

53:24.164 --> 53:27.751
- Find him.
- Jane?

53:27.834 --> 53:29.419
What?

53:29.502 --> 53:32.047
- I think I found him.
- Where?

53:32.130 --> 53:34.466
Here.

53:36.468 --> 53:39.095
Heat sensor breach in the perimeter.

53:39.179 --> 53:42.641
Commence scanning all floors.

53:45.477 --> 53:48.104
I told you not to bother me
at the office, honey.

53:48.188 --> 53:54.069
- Well, you are still Mrs Smith.
- Well, so are a lot of girls.

53:54.152 --> 53:56.821
Careful. I can push the button
any time, anywhere.

53:56.905 --> 54:00.408
Baby, you couldn't find the button
with both hands and a map.

54:02.619 --> 54:05.580
Last warning. You need to disappear.

54:05.664 --> 54:06.873
- No.
- Now.

54:06.957 --> 54:08.458
D sector clear.

54:08.541 --> 54:12.837
- You expect me to roll over and play dead?
- Should be used to it after five years.

54:12.921 --> 54:17.384
- Six. And I'm not leaving.
- E sector clear.

54:19.678 --> 54:21.554
Anywhere, any time.

54:22.180 --> 54:24.391
Intruder detected.

54:24.474 --> 54:28.812
- Evacuate plan C.
- Evacuation in progress.

54:30.855 --> 54:33.650
Evacuation in progress.

54:35.443 --> 54:37.571
Evacuation in progress.

54:51.835 --> 54:54.129
Evacuation in progress.

55:49.267 --> 55:51.019
Chickenshit!

55:52.270 --> 55:53.897
Pussy!

56:00.320 --> 56:03.031
You tell me you had a shot at her
and you didn't take it?

56:03.365 --> 56:08.078
We got all this stuff here, and you're trying
to tell me you couldn't take her out?

56:08.161 --> 56:13.500
Well, now she's a problem for both of us.
Now my house is priority one.

56:13.959 --> 56:15.961
Just gimme a hand, will you?

56:16.044 --> 56:20.257
You're driving me crazy with the tongs
and the furnace. You're like an insane man.

56:20.340 --> 56:24.052
All right, they gave you 48 hours.
What we got left here?

56:24.135 --> 56:27.639
- 23? 22?
- 18 and change.

56:27.722 --> 56:31.017
- 18 hours until they close the book on you?
- Eddie?

56:31.101 --> 56:35.814
Mom, we're on high alert here!
I almost killed you right then.

56:35.897 --> 56:40.068
- You do not even realise!
- Never mind.

56:40.151 --> 56:43.363
I am so done playing games with this broad.

56:43.446 --> 56:46.950
- You gotta take her out head-on.
- Don't tell me how to handle my wife.

56:47.033 --> 56:50.412
She's not your wife, she's the enemy.
She could be outside now!

56:50.495 --> 56:52.372
Eddie.

56:52.455 --> 56:54.708
Got it.

56:55.584 --> 56:59.129
Now we're talking. Only question is,
how much is it to buy a vowel?

57:05.343 --> 57:08.305
- Blackbow Realty.
- Hi, I'm from I-Temp.

57:08.388 --> 57:10.890
Great!
How's our new penthouse working out?

57:10.974 --> 57:14.019
Well, just fine, thank you for asking.

57:41.588 --> 57:44.966
This is security.
There's a problem with your elevator, sir.

57:45.050 --> 57:47.969
Do you want an engineer
to come see what the problem is?

57:48.053 --> 57:51.014
Take your time, I'm really quite comfortable.

57:51.097 --> 57:53.975
Are you really comfortable?

57:54.059 --> 57:55.894
Jane?

57:57.020 --> 57:59.564
Is that you, sweetheart?

57:59.648 --> 58:02.734
First and last warning, John.
Get out of town.

58:03.568 --> 58:05.904
You know I'm not going anywhere.

58:05.987 --> 58:09.699
Well, so you say. But right now,
you're trapped in a steel box

58:09.783 --> 58:12.285
hanging 70 floors over nothing but air.

58:12.369 --> 58:15.956
- Oh, so this is a trap?
- He's in car three.

58:16.039 --> 58:18.250
It's never gonna work, honey.

58:18.333 --> 58:23.088
It's never gonna work,
because you constantly underestimate me.

58:23.171 --> 58:26.216
- Do I?
- You have no idea who I am.

58:26.299 --> 58:29.135
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

58:30.136 --> 58:33.348
- Well, back at you, baby.
- Let me guess...

58:34.099 --> 58:39.396
Shaped charge on the counterbalance cable,
two on the primary and secondary brakes?

58:39.479 --> 58:40.981
Maybe?

58:41.064 --> 58:43.650
- He found them.
- Yes, thank you.

58:43.733 --> 58:48.154
Did you also get the base charge
on the principle cable?

58:49.197 --> 58:52.284
Promise to leave town, or I'll blow it.

58:57.831 --> 59:00.667
OK. I give up.

59:01.918 --> 59:04.713
Blow it.

59:04.796 --> 59:08.300
- What?
- Go on, blow it.

59:08.383 --> 59:12.470
- You think I won't?
- I think you won't.

59:13.555 --> 59:15.974
OK.

59:16.057 --> 59:18.643
Five, four...

59:19.102 --> 59:22.480
- Any last words?
- The new curtains are hideous.

59:22.564 --> 59:23.648
Goodbye, John.

59:35.201 --> 59:40.040
- What the hell was that?
- What? You said goodbye.

59:51.134 --> 59:53.553
The gas! Cut off the gas!

01:00:16.868 --> 01:00:18.870
Jane?

01:01:29.065 --> 01:01:31.943
Madame.

01:01:32.027 --> 01:01:35.405
Thought of a number of lines
for this moment.

01:01:35.488 --> 01:01:40.410
"Thought I'd just drop in."
"Hey, doll, thanks for giving me the shaft."

01:01:40.493 --> 01:01:44.164
Nice. So what did you decide?

01:01:44.915 --> 01:01:47.167
I want a divorce.

01:01:47.626 --> 01:01:51.546
I like it. You proposed to me here,
so it has agreeable symmetry.

01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:53.965
Coat, sir?

01:01:55.258 --> 01:01:57.594
- May I sit?
- No.

01:02:12.984 --> 01:02:15.987
- Champagne?
- No, champagne's for celebrating.

01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:19.241
- I'll have a martini.
- I'm fine, thank you.

01:02:23.286 --> 01:02:26.414
So what do you want, John?

01:02:26.498 --> 01:02:29.167
We have an unusual problem, Jane.

01:02:30.168 --> 01:02:35.048
You obviously want me dead. And I'm
less and less concerned of your wellbeing.

01:02:35.131 --> 01:02:37.384
So what do we do?

01:02:38.551 --> 01:02:42.097
Do we shoot it out here? Hope for the best?

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:48.562
Well, that would be a shame, because they'd
probably ask me to leave once you're dead.

01:02:51.773 --> 01:02:54.109
Dance with me.

01:02:55.944 --> 01:02:59.573
- You don't dance.
- That was just part of my cover, sweetheart.

01:02:59.656 --> 01:03:02.075
Was sloth part of it too?

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.960
Think this'll have a happy ending?

01:03:12.043 --> 01:03:16.798
Happy endings are just
stories that haven't finished yet.

01:03:37.319 --> 01:03:39.404
Satisfied?

01:03:39.487 --> 01:03:41.948
Not for years.

01:03:48.788 --> 01:03:51.124
It's all John, sweetheart.

01:04:09.142 --> 01:04:12.771
Why is it you think we failed?
Cos we were leading separate lives?

01:04:12.854 --> 01:04:15.065
Or was it all the lying that did us in?

01:04:15.148 --> 01:04:18.276
I have a theory. Newly formed.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.279
- I'm breathless to hear it.
- You killed us.

01:04:21.363 --> 01:04:23.698
Provocative.

01:04:24.532 --> 01:04:29.329
You approached our marriage like ajob,
to be reconned, planned and executed.

01:04:29.412 --> 01:04:31.623
And you avoided it.

01:04:31.706 --> 01:04:34.292
What do you care, if I was just a cover?

01:04:34.376 --> 01:04:37.587
Well, who said you were just a cover?

01:04:37.671 --> 01:04:40.507
- Wasn't I?
- Wasn't I?

01:04:47.514 --> 01:04:49.891
I have to... Excuse me.

01:04:50.684 --> 01:04:53.019
No exits up there, Jane.

01:04:57.023 --> 01:04:59.943
Be cold, John. She's a liar.

01:05:03.947 --> 01:05:07.075
Be super cold.

01:05:19.754 --> 01:05:22.090
Come on, madam, this way.

01:05:38.148 --> 01:05:41.067
Do you know that you're ticking?

01:05:45.697 --> 01:05:48.158
Get back!

01:05:53.288 --> 01:05:55.498
Limo, sir?

01:06:11.306 --> 01:06:12.432
Jane Smith.

01:06:12.891 --> 01:06:16.603
- That's the second time you tried to kill me.
- It was just a little bomb.

01:06:16.686 --> 01:06:19.773
I'm going home to burn
everything I ever bought you.

01:06:19.856 --> 01:06:22.567
I'll race you there, baby.

01:06:38.208 --> 01:06:39.960
You there yet?

01:06:40.043 --> 01:06:43.463
First time we met,
what was your first thought?

01:06:44.047 --> 01:06:46.007
You tell me.

01:06:46.091 --> 01:06:48.385
I thought...

01:06:51.346 --> 01:06:54.474
I thought you looked like Christmas morning.

01:06:55.475 --> 01:06:58.270
I don't know how else to say it.

01:06:58.353 --> 01:07:00.981
And why are you telling me this now?

01:07:01.898 --> 01:07:06.403
Guess in the end
you start thinking about the beginning.

01:07:08.196 --> 01:07:11.491
So there it is.
I thought you should know.

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:16.288
So how about it, Jane? Hm?

01:07:17.497 --> 01:07:19.874
I thought...

01:07:25.839 --> 01:07:30.719
I thought that you were
the most beautiful mark I'd ever seen.

01:07:34.139 --> 01:07:36.600
- So it was all business, yeah?
- All business.

01:07:36.683 --> 01:07:39.019
- From the go.
- Cold, hard math.

01:07:40.604 --> 01:07:43.815
Thank you.
That's what I needed to know.

01:07:46.151 --> 01:07:48.320
OK.

01:08:39.246 --> 01:08:41.247
Hey, John.

01:08:41.331 --> 01:08:42.540
Hey, Bill.

01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:45.710
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:08:45.794 --> 01:08:47.796
OK.

01:08:49.339 --> 01:08:54.426
Uh, by the way, John, your car
is hanging out over the sidewalk here.

01:08:54.511 --> 01:08:57.138
- Yeah, thanks, Bill.
- OK. Have a good night.

01:08:57.221 --> 01:08:59.099
Good night.

01:09:00.225 --> 01:09:02.227
Shit.

01:09:50.274 --> 01:09:52.611
Shit.

01:11:38.758 --> 01:11:40.635
You still alive, baby?

01:12:56.002 --> 01:12:59.714
Your aim's as bad as your cooking,
sweetheart.

01:13:01.591 --> 01:13:04.010
And that's saying something.

01:13:38.253 --> 01:13:40.839
Come on, honey.

01:13:40.922 --> 01:13:43.675
Come to Daddy.

01:13:51.057 --> 01:13:53.393
Who's your daddy now?

01:15:23.275 --> 01:15:25.610
Can't do it.

01:15:28.238 --> 01:15:31.241
Don't! Come on.

01:15:31.324 --> 01:15:34.035
Come on!

01:15:35.078 --> 01:15:37.330
You want it?

01:15:37.414 --> 01:15:39.457
It's yours.

01:16:52.948 --> 01:16:55.867
Hi, stranger.

01:16:55.951 --> 01:16:58.286
Hiya back.

01:17:08.213 --> 01:17:12.092
- Yeah?
- Everything OK? We heard an awful ruckus.

01:17:12.175 --> 01:17:16.972
- No, everything's fine here. Yeah, it's great.
- So you guys are fine?

01:17:17.055 --> 01:17:19.349
Yeah, couldn't be better.

01:17:21.685 --> 01:17:23.687
Nice. You guys are...

01:17:23.770 --> 01:17:25.814
- Suzy, Martin.
- Have a nice night.

01:17:25.897 --> 01:17:30.402
Looks like you're redecorating, it's very...
Yeah. Shame about the red oak...

01:17:36.783 --> 01:17:39.160
Five more minutes, Mom...

01:17:51.256 --> 01:17:55.510
Tempting. But I don't get out of bed
for less than half a million dollars.

01:18:59.282 --> 01:19:02.410
- That left of yours... A thing of beauty.
- You take it well.

01:19:02.494 --> 01:19:04.746
Thank you.

01:19:07.249 --> 01:19:09.584
That vacation in Aspen?

01:19:10.794 --> 01:19:13.171
You left early. Why?

01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:17.050
- Jean-Luc Gaspard.
- Oh, God!

01:19:17.133 --> 01:19:19.302
- Yeah.
- I wanted him.

01:19:19.386 --> 01:19:21.805
Forget it.

01:19:22.931 --> 01:19:27.394
You didn't hear me that night the chopper
dropped me off for our anniversary dinner.

01:19:27.477 --> 01:19:30.063
- No.
- No?

01:19:31.439 --> 01:19:34.901
Percussion grenades.
I was partially deaf that night.

01:19:40.407 --> 01:19:42.659
I'm slightly colour blind.

01:19:42.742 --> 01:19:47.581
- Retinal scarring.
- I can't feel anything in these three fingers.

01:19:57.215 --> 01:20:02.470
Three ribs. Broken eye socket.
Perforated eardrum.

01:20:06.433 --> 01:20:09.686
You ever have trouble sleeping after?

01:20:11.104 --> 01:20:13.440
- Nope.
- Yeah, me neither.

01:20:46.264 --> 01:20:49.184
Go, go, go.
Look out.

01:20:50.936 --> 01:20:52.729
Move it.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.107
Shoes.

01:20:59.402 --> 01:21:01.780
I was given 48 hours to take you out.

01:21:01.863 --> 01:21:03.448
Same.

01:21:03.531 --> 01:21:05.951
Jesus, where's the trust?

01:21:06.034 --> 01:21:08.370
What do you expect?

01:21:13.416 --> 01:21:16.169
Why do I get the girl gun?

01:21:18.964 --> 01:21:21.591
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

01:22:55.143 --> 01:22:57.479
We need a car.

01:23:02.025 --> 01:23:03.526
Colemans.

01:23:06.738 --> 01:23:09.491
Guy's had my barbecue set for months.

01:23:10.492 --> 01:23:14.079
- I was never in the Peace Corps.
- What?

01:23:14.162 --> 01:23:16.206
I really liked that about you.

01:23:16.289 --> 01:23:20.085
Maybe this honesty thing
isn't such a good idea.

01:23:20.168 --> 01:23:22.587
- I didn't go to MIT.
- Really?

01:23:22.671 --> 01:23:25.840
Notre Dame. Art History major.

01:23:27.092 --> 01:23:29.719
- Art?
- History.

01:23:29.803 --> 01:23:32.347
- It's reputable.
- OK.

01:23:52.659 --> 01:23:55.245
Fuckers get younger every year.

01:24:01.001 --> 01:24:05.046
I have to tell you,
I never really liked your cooking.

01:24:06.047 --> 01:24:08.133
It's not your gift.

01:24:08.216 --> 01:24:11.386
Baby, I've never cooked a day in my life.

01:24:12.554 --> 01:24:14.931
I-Temp girls cooked.

01:24:16.933 --> 01:24:19.352
Web of lies!

01:24:20.770 --> 01:24:24.274
I don't know how you do it

01:24:24.357 --> 01:24:27.068
Making love

01:24:27.152 --> 01:24:28.778
Out of nothing at all

01:24:28.862 --> 01:24:30.864
Making love...

01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:33.658
I like it. Deal with it.

01:24:38.288 --> 01:24:40.707
- We got company.
- What?

01:24:42.375 --> 01:24:44.753
Shit.

01:24:54.304 --> 01:24:59.976
- Baby, hold steady now!
- It's called evasive driving, sweetheart.

01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:04.064
Hold still.

01:25:10.487 --> 01:25:13.823
This thing's all over the place.
How do you drive these things?

01:25:13.907 --> 01:25:14.950
Honey!

01:25:21.831 --> 01:25:24.000
- Honey, let me drive.
- I got it.

01:25:24.084 --> 01:25:27.420
Move over. Move.

01:25:27.504 --> 01:25:29.923
I'm the suburban housewife, sweetheart.

01:25:30.006 --> 01:25:32.300
- You move.
- Fine. Go.

01:25:34.511 --> 01:25:36.680
- Go.
- Go.

01:25:46.523 --> 01:25:48.900
They're bulletproof.

01:25:48.984 --> 01:25:51.319
They're bulletproof!

01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:03.331
I think I should probably tell you.

01:26:03.415 --> 01:26:06.710
I was married once before.

01:26:12.841 --> 01:26:16.052
- What is wrong with you?
- You're what's wrong with me.

01:26:16.136 --> 01:26:20.056
- It was a drunken Vegas thing.
- That's better. That's much better. Great.

01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:22.142
Stop it.

01:26:29.774 --> 01:26:30.984
Go, go, go!

01:26:39.367 --> 01:26:43.705
- Her name and social security number?
- No, you're not gonna kill her.

01:27:11.733 --> 01:27:14.194
These doors are handy.

01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:23.662
You know, sweetheart,
you're being a bit hypocritical.

01:27:23.745 --> 01:27:27.123
It's not like you're some beacon of truth.

01:27:29.626 --> 01:27:31.962
John, my parents...

01:27:33.129 --> 01:27:35.799
They died when I was five.
I'm an orphan.

01:27:35.882 --> 01:27:39.094
Who was that kindly fellow
who gave you away at our wedding?

01:27:39.177 --> 01:27:41.429
Paid actor.

01:27:43.139 --> 01:27:45.934
<i>I said I saw your dad on Fantasy Island.</i>

01:27:46.017 --> 01:27:47.894
I know.

01:27:47.978 --> 01:27:49.980
I don't even want to talk about it.

01:28:05.579 --> 01:28:07.747
- You got it?
- Got it.

01:28:08.582 --> 01:28:10.750
- Any time.
- I got it.

01:28:52.918 --> 01:28:58.006
We're gonna have to redo
every conversation we've ever had.

01:28:58.089 --> 01:28:59.716
I'm Jewish.

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:05.096
Can't believe I brought
my real parents to our wedding.

01:29:05.388 --> 01:29:07.515
Disgusting.
How could you serve this?

01:29:07.599 --> 01:29:13.521
Ma'am, is it possible to get this reheated?
Miss? Miss, I'm talking to you. Excuse me?

01:29:14.564 --> 01:29:16.566
Jesus, Johnny.

01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:19.277
- Good morning, Eddie.
- Morning.

01:29:19.361 --> 01:29:21.696
It's good to see you're OK.

01:29:23.156 --> 01:29:26.409
Tell me you got smart
and that you killed that lying bitch.

01:29:26.493 --> 01:29:29.079
This lying bitch?

01:29:29.162 --> 01:29:31.706
Guess it was just wishful thinking.

01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:32.999
- I'm sorry.
- Eddie.

01:29:33.083 --> 01:29:37.254
- Nice to see you, Jane.
- Eddie. Eddie! Focus. We got problems.

01:29:37.337 --> 01:29:41.466
Problems? Crack addicts got problems,
my friend. You two are smoked.

01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:42.842
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

01:29:42.926 --> 01:29:47.097
You got the entire agency gunning for you.
Probably her agency, too.

01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:51.059
- And what about you? Where you at?
- Me? Where am I at?

01:29:52.018 --> 01:29:55.730
I find myself dragging my feet this morning.

01:29:55.814 --> 01:29:58.692
I think you owe me a little money, anyway.

01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:04.573
- So what do...
- We don't understand each other.

01:30:04.656 --> 01:30:07.826
But I don't need those looks, OK?
I been in his life a long time.

01:30:07.909 --> 01:30:10.245
- Focus, Eddie, focus.
- A long time.

01:30:10.328 --> 01:30:15.625
I'm pissed off. They blew up my house,
they shot at my wife. My own company.

01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:19.212
If she works for
who the street says that she works for...

01:30:21.006 --> 01:30:26.261
<i>...you're Macy's and Gimbel's. Then she would
be the WE channel, and you would be...</i>

01:30:26.344 --> 01:30:30.348
Whatever channel competes against
the WE channel. Know what I'm saying?

01:30:30.432 --> 01:30:34.311
The point is simple. Once you guys
get off the reservation, that's it.

01:30:34.394 --> 01:30:37.355
- Then you're off the reservation.
- Eddie, how bad?

01:30:37.439 --> 01:30:39.941
How bad is it?

01:30:40.025 --> 01:30:42.277
You remember Canada.

01:30:42.694 --> 01:30:45.030
- Kids' stuff next to this.
- That was you?

01:30:45.113 --> 01:30:48.241
Is that a turn-on?
Didn't she try to kill you with a car?

01:30:48.325 --> 01:30:51.369
A good friend stays out of it.
This is the facts.

01:30:51.453 --> 01:30:57.083
If you two separate from each other, you got
a shot. Not a great shot, Johnny, but a shot.

01:30:57.167 --> 01:31:00.962
You two stay together, you're dead.

01:31:01.046 --> 01:31:05.717
Unless you can find something they want
more than they want you.

01:31:10.138 --> 01:31:14.309
Found him. He's being held
in sub-basement D of the federal courthouse.

01:31:14.392 --> 01:31:19.606
High security, motion and thermal.
Power's on the city grid.

01:31:20.398 --> 01:31:23.485
This is as far as we go, Jane.

01:31:23.568 --> 01:31:27.489
- Right. Thanks for everything.
- Good luck, baby.

01:31:30.408 --> 01:31:36.039
<i>...and this north-westerly blow coming
down from the middle of the country...</i>

01:31:36.122 --> 01:31:38.458
Do you guys mind changing the channel?

01:31:38.541 --> 01:31:40.669
<i>...one is moving in now...</i>

01:31:40.752 --> 01:31:46.216
Nick? Would you please get off
your fat ass and change the channel?

01:31:46.299 --> 01:31:52.722
<i>- I know it's tough. Thank you.
- ...tomorrow, that's going to make things...</i>

01:32:18.582 --> 01:32:23.169
30 second window. I cut the power,
you grab the kid. Simple and clean. Got it?

01:32:23.253 --> 01:32:25.630
Got it.

01:32:25.714 --> 01:32:28.300
Tell me, how many?

01:32:30.010 --> 01:32:32.178
Does it matter?

01:32:32.262 --> 01:32:34.931
- Should I go first?
- OK.

01:32:35.432 --> 01:32:38.101
I don't exactly keep count, but...

01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:41.229
I would say...

01:32:41.313 --> 01:32:43.648
<i>High 50s, low 60s.</i>

01:32:45.692 --> 01:32:48.987
I've been around the block,
but the important thing is...

01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:51.239
312.

01:32:52.574 --> 01:32:54.910
312?

01:32:56.745 --> 01:32:59.289
- How?
- Some were two at a time.

01:33:05.879 --> 01:33:08.632
- Honey?
- I'm...

01:33:15.096 --> 01:33:18.600
- You monitoring the perimeter?
- I checked the perimeter.

01:33:18.683 --> 01:33:21.603
- What about the police bands?
- I'm on the police bands.

01:33:21.686 --> 01:33:23.855
- Connected...
- This is not my first time.

01:33:25.148 --> 01:33:27.943
Think we've established that.

01:33:31.238 --> 01:33:32.280
All right.

01:33:34.324 --> 01:33:36.618
Turn left.

01:33:36.701 --> 01:33:38.453
Left, John.

01:33:39.162 --> 01:33:40.747
Left.

01:33:41.289 --> 01:33:45.335
You don't need to talk to me like that.
OK? Be nice.

01:33:45.418 --> 01:33:48.380
- Left, please.
- I can't go left.

01:33:48.463 --> 01:33:51.967
See? There is no left. Look.

01:33:52.050 --> 01:33:54.511
I have straight, or back the way I came.

01:33:54.594 --> 01:33:56.805
There's no left.
Which way do you want?

01:33:56.888 --> 01:34:00.225
- Just stay there and wait for my mark.
- See what I'm sitting in?

01:34:00.308 --> 01:34:02.310
You see that?

01:34:03.311 --> 01:34:05.647
- Take your time.
- Yeah, all right! Stay.

01:34:05.730 --> 01:34:08.525
Stay there, wait for my mark. I'll find it.

01:34:10.318 --> 01:34:12.487
Wait for my mark.

01:34:16.825 --> 01:34:21.246
Almost there.
I don't know what happened. Just hold on.

01:34:28.253 --> 01:34:32.716
John, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:34:32.799 --> 01:34:35.552
Cut the lights on my signal.

01:34:36.511 --> 01:34:38.972
Now. Kill the lights.

01:34:40.348 --> 01:34:42.767
- Jane, kill the lights.
- What's that?

01:34:42.851 --> 01:34:47.689
- Where?
- Turn 'em back on! Idiot!

01:34:49.190 --> 01:34:51.359
- Here they come.
- Uncuff me.

01:34:51.985 --> 01:34:55.864
Turn 'em back on.
Turn 'em back on!

01:34:57.324 --> 01:34:59.534
- Turn 'em back on!
- All right!

01:35:00.285 --> 01:35:03.246
- Give me the light!
- Shut up!

01:35:06.124 --> 01:35:08.335
- Nick!
- Shut up.

01:35:12.339 --> 01:35:15.550
Give me a gun.
Nick, give me a gun!

01:35:15.634 --> 01:35:17.636
Zip it!

01:35:35.654 --> 01:35:38.031
This guy's a wily one.

01:35:48.541 --> 01:35:51.753
- You didn't wait for my signal.
- I improvised.

01:35:51.836 --> 01:35:54.256
- You deviated from the plan.
- Plan was flawed.

01:35:54.339 --> 01:35:57.926
- The plan was not flawed.
- Anal.

01:35:58.009 --> 01:36:00.887
- Organised.
- Jane, 90 per cent of this job is instinct.

01:36:00.971 --> 01:36:05.225
- Your instincts set off the alarms.
- And got the job done. Not The Jane Show...

01:36:05.308 --> 01:36:09.396
No, it was The John Show. Half-assed.
Like Christmas, our anniversary,

01:36:09.479 --> 01:36:12.440
the time you forgot to bring
my mother's birthday present.

01:36:12.524 --> 01:36:17.195
- Your fake mother's birthday.
- You are always the first to break team.

01:36:17.279 --> 01:36:20.198
You don't want a team,
you want a servant for hire.

01:36:20.282 --> 01:36:23.118
I want someone I can count on.

01:36:23.201 --> 01:36:27.956
- Jane, there's no air around you any more.
- OK, what is that supposed to mean?

01:36:28.039 --> 01:36:32.711
It means there's no room for mistakes,
no mistakes whatsoever. No spontaneity.

01:36:32.794 --> 01:36:35.338
- Who can answer to that?
- Well, you don't have to.

01:36:35.422 --> 01:36:38.258
Cos this isn't even a real marriage.

01:36:39.259 --> 01:36:42.262
- Who are you people?
- Shut up!

01:36:48.184 --> 01:36:50.395
OK. So, now I realise

01:36:50.478 --> 01:36:54.608
you witnessed the missus and I
working through some domestic issues.

01:36:54.691 --> 01:36:57.027
That's regrettable.

01:36:58.278 --> 01:37:01.907
But don't take that as a sign of weakness.
That would be a mistake.

01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:04.576
Now, tell us what you know.

01:37:04.659 --> 01:37:07.621
Why do both our bosses want you dead?

01:37:09.372 --> 01:37:12.334
You underst... Honey.

01:37:12.417 --> 01:37:14.586
Please?

01:37:15.629 --> 01:37:16.838
Wrap it up.

01:37:16.922 --> 01:37:20.800
Maybe it's not a good idea
to undermine me in front of the hostage.

01:37:20.884 --> 01:37:23.178
Sends a mixed message.

01:37:23.929 --> 01:37:25.639
Sorry.

01:37:25.722 --> 01:37:27.807
Girls.

01:37:29.142 --> 01:37:31.895
OK. Where was I?

01:37:31.978 --> 01:37:34.481
- A mistake on your part.
- Shut up. Options.

01:37:34.564 --> 01:37:37.567
I'm gonna lay out your options for you, OK?
Option A...

01:37:37.651 --> 01:37:40.028
- If I could...
- Shut up.

01:37:40.111 --> 01:37:43.907
Option A. You talk, we listen, no pain.

01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:46.451
Option B. You don't talk.

01:37:46.534 --> 01:37:50.163
I remove your thumbs with my pliers.
It will hurt.

01:37:50.997 --> 01:37:53.166
Option C.

01:37:53.250 --> 01:37:57.420
I like to vary the details a bit,
but the punch line is, you die.

01:38:00.507 --> 01:38:04.469
Benjamin?
We're impatient people, Benjamin.

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:14.187
Can I get a soda? Or ajuice, or some...

01:38:15.021 --> 01:38:17.732
A, option A!

01:38:17.816 --> 01:38:21.236
- Ow, that hurt!
- OK, that was a nice shot.

01:38:26.533 --> 01:38:28.535
What's... You got a spasm?

01:38:28.618 --> 01:38:32.372
I'm tied up.
Why don't you check my back pocket?

01:38:40.964 --> 01:38:44.092
I'm not the target.
You are. Both of you.

01:38:45.093 --> 01:38:50.015
They found out you're married, so they
teamed up and sent you to the same hit.

01:38:50.098 --> 01:38:52.267
It was ajoint task force, both companies.

01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:56.479
Two competing agents living under
the same roof? It's bad for business.

01:38:56.563 --> 01:39:01.192
- They wanted you to take each other out.
- You were bait.

01:39:01.276 --> 01:39:04.279
Well, it's entry level.
Toehold into the company.

01:39:04.362 --> 01:39:08.074
Couple hits, they bump me up to a desk.
It's pretty cool, actually.

01:39:08.158 --> 01:39:11.411
- You keep the photo in your pocket?
- Was I supposed to frame it?

01:39:11.494 --> 01:39:14.581
You get rid of it. You burn it.
Tradecraft 101.

01:39:14.664 --> 01:39:19.878
Guess I skipped that day. I guess you skipped
the day about not marrying the enemy.

01:39:19.961 --> 01:39:22.255
You were bait or you are bait?

01:39:26.468 --> 01:39:28.845
Belt! Belt, belt, dude.

01:39:37.187 --> 01:39:39.689
Two minutes.

01:39:40.273 --> 01:39:42.609
One minute.

01:40:07.342 --> 01:40:09.010
- A little help?
- Clear.

01:40:09.094 --> 01:40:11.388
Clear.

01:40:30.782 --> 01:40:33.952
My way out is a boat standing by in La Paz.

01:40:36.871 --> 01:40:40.000
Cargo drop, Atlas Mountains. So what?

01:40:40.083 --> 01:40:42.711
So at least apart we know what the odds are.

01:40:45.213 --> 01:40:47.716
Let's just call this what it is.

01:40:48.758 --> 01:40:51.344
And what it isn't.

01:40:55.265 --> 01:40:57.517
All right, so it's a crap marriage.

01:40:57.601 --> 01:41:01.313
All right, I'm a mess, you're a disaster.

01:41:01.396 --> 01:41:03.690
We're both liars.

01:41:05.150 --> 01:41:08.194
But you run, you'll always be running.

01:41:10.238 --> 01:41:12.908
I say we stay and fight.

01:41:12.991 --> 01:41:15.994
We finish this thing.

01:41:16.077 --> 01:41:18.288
Then if you want to go, you can go.

01:41:18.371 --> 01:41:20.582
Well, thank you.

01:41:20.665 --> 01:41:25.629
What? "Let's call this what it is."
Jesus Christ...

01:41:25.712 --> 01:41:28.048
- Stop...
- Don't.

01:42:20.475 --> 01:42:22.978
This is a really good store.

01:43:34.966 --> 01:43:38.929
- See you in the next life, Jane.
- Likewise, John.

01:45:21.239 --> 01:45:23.450
Sorry.

01:45:26.328 --> 01:45:29.623
We'll talk about this later.

01:45:43.345 --> 01:45:45.722
Jesus!

01:45:47.766 --> 01:45:51.394
- I didn't touch a thing.
- Yes, you did.

01:46:30.642 --> 01:46:34.938
- Sorry about the knife in the...
- I don't want to talk about it.

01:46:39.651 --> 01:46:42.028
- I'll fly.
- I'll be bait.

01:46:43.154 --> 01:46:46.116
I'm going clockwise. Watch my six.

01:47:34.789 --> 01:47:36.791
Go! Move!

01:48:51.741 --> 01:48:54.077
How's it look?

01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:59.416
It's a piece of cake.

01:49:08.049 --> 01:49:10.468
Watch these, they tend to jam.

01:49:10.552 --> 01:49:12.888
So watch 'em.

01:49:13.763 --> 01:49:18.184
You favour your left,
sweetheart, so I'll cover right.

01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:35.952
Damn, that boat in La Paz is looking
pretty good right now, isn't it?

01:49:38.205 --> 01:49:41.499
Well, it rains a lot this time of year.

01:49:48.173 --> 01:49:53.178
There's nowhere I'd rather be
than right here, with you.

01:49:55.764 --> 01:49:57.766
Shut up.

01:51:26.771 --> 01:51:30.775
I'm interested in the progress
you've made in the last few weeks.

01:51:30.859 --> 01:51:35.947
Doing all right, aren't we? I'm not gonna lie
to you, there were times when I wanted to...

01:51:36.031 --> 01:51:38.575
<i>- ...kill her, but...
- Likewise.</i>

01:51:38.658 --> 01:51:41.202
- Couldn't take the shot.
- That's a good sign.

01:51:41.286 --> 01:51:43.997
- Who'd have thought?
- You have to battle through.

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:48.877
- That's marriage, right?
- Yeah. Take your best shot, and...

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:52.505
- Oh, we redid the house.
- We did. Yes, we did.

01:51:53.256 --> 01:51:56.718
You know there will always be challenges?
Threats out there?

01:51:56.801 --> 01:51:58.470
Yup.

01:51:58.553 --> 01:52:01.348
But you can handle it together.

01:52:01.431 --> 01:52:04.476
- So far.
- Yes, we can... So far?

01:52:05.518 --> 01:52:07.896
What is that?

01:52:07.979 --> 01:52:11.191
- I'm leaving room for the unknown.
- So far.

01:52:12.192 --> 01:52:16.029
And do you feel your relationship styles
are more conducive to this...

01:52:16.112 --> 01:52:18.990
Ask us the sex question.

01:52:19.074 --> 01:52:21.034
John.

01:52:22.035 --> 01:52:23.703
Well, that...

01:52:23.787 --> 01:52:26.498
Ten.

01:59:44.769 --> 01:59:47.689
