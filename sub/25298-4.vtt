00:30.861 --> 00:32.452
[Bill] You're going
to the doctor

00:32.452 --> 00:34.244
for a checkup,
and that's that!

00:34.244 --> 00:35.746
[Gramma]
I ain't goin'!

00:35.746 --> 00:38.288
I don't need
some snake-oil salesman

00:38.288 --> 00:42.923
rubbing cream on me
and giving me funny pills!

00:42.923 --> 00:45.335
No, Ma, that's not
what doctors are like today.

00:45.335 --> 00:48.258
They're nice! You'll even
get a lollypop. It's fun!

00:48.258 --> 00:50.881
And that's when they
stick you with the leeches!

00:50.881 --> 00:54.224
No sirree, there'll be
no doctors today!

00:54.224 --> 00:57.057
Not over my healthy body!

00:57.057 --> 00:59.309
-[grunts]
-But, Gramma,
if you're so healthy,

00:59.309 --> 01:01.682
why do you groan
when you stand up?

01:01.682 --> 01:04.735
I ain't groaning,
I'm growling!

01:04.735 --> 01:07.357
-[protesting]
-Well, off to the doctor's!

01:08.989 --> 01:10.400
Oh, right,
my two kids!

01:10.400 --> 01:12.242
Can't leave 'em
at home alone.

01:12.242 --> 01:13.744
I guess I gotta
call a sitter.

01:13.744 --> 01:15.365
Aw, Dad, you don't
need a sitter.

01:15.365 --> 01:17.157
We can be
our own babysitter!

01:17.157 --> 01:18.579
You can trust us.
Ooh, aah.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.041
Forgot I had a bunch
of rusty nails in my pocket.

01:21.041 --> 01:23.543
-Uh, Tilly.
-Yes, Papa?

01:23.543 --> 01:26.126
Watch Cricket and make sure
nothing bad happens.

01:26.126 --> 01:28.088
I need you to be
the big sister today.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.379
I'm counting on you, honey.

01:29.379 --> 01:30.881
-[gasps]
-What? Aw!

01:30.881 --> 01:32.302
Of course
you'd pick Tilly.

01:32.302 --> 01:34.474
Always doing
what she's told, meh meh meh.

01:34.474 --> 01:36.677
You will not be
disappointed, Papa.

01:36.677 --> 01:40.180
I promise I'll be the best
babysitter there ever was!

01:40.180 --> 01:43.103
I can't imagine
you letting me down.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.775
-[protesting]
-All right, be good.

01:44.775 --> 01:47.277
Please be good.
Just please.

01:47.277 --> 01:50.570
Bye, Papa!
Don't you worry about nothin'.

01:52.693 --> 01:54.114
Hello, sister.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.285
Hello, Cricket.

01:55.285 --> 01:57.908
Are you ready to have
a nice quiet time?

01:57.908 --> 01:58.949
I am not!

01:58.949 --> 02:00.791
With Dad and Gramma
out of the house,

02:00.791 --> 02:02.743
it's the perfect time
for me to scratch

02:02.743 --> 02:05.625
a few items
off my bucket list!

02:05.625 --> 02:08.168
Bucket list? I guess
it's never too soon

02:08.168 --> 02:10.170
to start preparing
for your passing.

02:10.170 --> 02:11.752
What? No, Tilly, that's dark.

02:11.752 --> 02:14.755
It's a list of everything
you can do in or with a bucket.

02:14.755 --> 02:18.178
Bucket skateboarding.
Bucket boxing.

02:18.178 --> 02:20.350
Bucket fireworks
explosion extravaganza?

02:20.350 --> 02:22.262
I don't know
about this, Cricket.

02:22.262 --> 02:24.765
I wouldn't want
to break Papa's trust.

02:24.765 --> 02:25.766
Cricket?

02:27.267 --> 02:30.070
Don't you think this list
is a bit reckless?

02:30.070 --> 02:31.321
Of course it's reckless!

02:31.321 --> 02:32.823
Why do you think
we're doing it now?

02:32.823 --> 02:34.735
If Dad were here,
he'd never let us play

02:34.735 --> 02:37.447
something like
bucket-head bowling!

02:37.447 --> 02:41.041
Uh, this seems like
the opposite of what Papa--

02:41.041 --> 02:43.283
[grunting]

02:43.283 --> 02:45.956
This does not bode well
for my babysitting career.

02:45.956 --> 02:47.247
[laughs] Whee!

02:47.247 --> 02:50.380
Cricket! I must respectfully
request that you stop!

02:50.380 --> 02:51.752
-[laughing]
-Cricket!

02:51.752 --> 02:54.054
Can't hear ya
'cause I'm not listening!

02:54.054 --> 02:56.386
Aah! Wah!

02:57.557 --> 02:58.799
Whoa.

02:58.799 --> 03:01.181
Cricket, I am putting
my foot down.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.103
You gotta listen to me!

03:03.103 --> 03:05.435
If stuff's all messed up
when Papa gets back,

03:05.435 --> 03:08.518
he won't see me
as the responsible
young woman I am!

03:08.518 --> 03:09.569
Wait, where'd you go?

03:09.569 --> 03:10.691
Can't hear ya!

03:10.691 --> 03:13.653
Doing number 14
on the list.

03:13.653 --> 03:15.155
-Wah!
-[car alarm blaring]

03:15.155 --> 03:18.318
Oh, Cricket! I gotta get him
to listen to me.

03:18.318 --> 03:19.619
What should I do, Saxon?

03:19.619 --> 03:21.451
If I can't get
a handle on Cricket,

03:21.451 --> 03:24.244
I'm gonna let Papa down.
He'll never trust me again!

03:24.244 --> 03:25.826
I'll get... [swallows]

03:25.826 --> 03:27.287
the disappointed face.

03:27.287 --> 03:28.458
Yeah, that's the one.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.920
Oh, it's uncanny.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.422
But how do I get
Cricket to listen?

03:32.422 --> 03:35.295
-[in Saxon's voice] Scare him!
-Scare him? Explain.

03:35.295 --> 03:37.177
[in Saxon's voice]
Remember when the cat

03:37.177 --> 03:38.678
got himself stuck
in the dishwasher?

03:38.678 --> 03:40.680
He sure learned
his lesson!

03:40.680 --> 03:43.894
Nothing scares Dirtbag
more than a dirty dish.

03:43.894 --> 03:46.436
-[yowls]
-[crashing]

03:46.436 --> 03:51.311
I see. I gotta make him
scared of his bucket list.

03:51.311 --> 03:54.815
Bucket windmill ride,
all right!

03:54.815 --> 03:56.947
Aw. Come on,
you dang wind.

03:56.947 --> 03:58.528
Propel me to fun!

03:58.528 --> 04:00.530
[huffing]

04:00.530 --> 04:02.532
[Cricket] Ah, I'm tired.

04:02.532 --> 04:03.784
All right, Miss Brenda,

04:03.784 --> 04:05.786
we're gonna give Cricket
a little spook,

04:05.786 --> 04:07.367
just enough
to get him to listen.

04:07.367 --> 04:10.420
Forgive me.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.712
-[slap]
-[moos]

04:12.712 --> 04:16.877
I think I feel
a breeze start-- aah!

04:16.877 --> 04:19.139
See, Cricket,
if you'd have listened to me,

04:19.139 --> 04:21.091
you would not be spinning
in terror!

04:22.302 --> 04:23.974
[screaming]

04:23.974 --> 04:26.096
[gasps]

04:26.096 --> 04:29.559
[grunting down the tree]

04:29.559 --> 04:30.771

04:30.771 --> 04:32.442
[gasps] Cricket!

04:32.442 --> 04:33.944
Oh, Cricket!
Oh, my gosh!

04:33.944 --> 04:36.026
Talk to me, Cricket!
Are you okay?

04:36.026 --> 04:39.109
Eh, I'm okay.
I'm all right.

04:39.109 --> 04:41.201
Mm! I'm fine!

04:41.201 --> 04:42.612
Huh? Oh, that's funny.

04:42.612 --> 04:44.534
I meant to raise
both my arms.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.906
Aah!

04:45.906 --> 04:46.997
Your arm!

04:46.997 --> 04:48.668
I know earlier
I said I was fine,

04:48.668 --> 04:51.121
but I think I am
very much not fine!

04:51.121 --> 04:52.332
I'm so sorry, Cricket.

04:52.332 --> 04:54.214
No. I'm the one
who's sorry.

04:54.214 --> 04:55.796
I should've listened to you.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.587
You were right all along.

04:57.587 --> 05:01.681
You were so right,
it's almost like... you knew.

05:01.681 --> 05:03.683
-[swallows]
-You knew that I need help!

05:03.683 --> 05:05.515
Listenin' is not
my strong suit,

05:05.515 --> 05:08.018
so from now on I'm gonna
listen to whatever you say!

05:08.018 --> 05:09.229
It don't matter.

05:09.229 --> 05:10.851
When Papa finds out
you're hurt,

05:10.851 --> 05:12.602
I'm gonna be
in so much trouble!

05:12.602 --> 05:14.144
No. I'll be in trouble.

05:14.144 --> 05:16.356
I'll tell Dad that this
was not your fault.

05:16.356 --> 05:18.859
Yeah? I mean, no.

05:18.859 --> 05:20.861
I'm gonna get us
both out of this mess...

05:20.861 --> 05:23.203
regardless
of whose fault it is.

05:23.203 --> 05:25.075
I don't deserve you.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.207
Eh... um...

05:28.869 --> 05:31.661
There! That's about as good
as a doctor could do.

05:31.661 --> 05:33.583
Papa will never know.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.455
Wow! Pretty sturdy
for a mud cast.

05:35.455 --> 05:39.669
I think everything's
gonna be A-okay!

05:39.669 --> 05:41.962
[both screaming]

05:41.962 --> 05:43.463
Okay, this isn't working.

05:43.463 --> 05:46.226
Maybe we need to take you
to a real doctor.

05:46.226 --> 05:47.968
But that's where Dad
and Gramma are!

05:47.968 --> 05:49.639
I'll get
in trouble for sure.

05:49.639 --> 05:51.231
Hmm... No!

05:51.231 --> 05:55.065
We won't get in trouble
if they can't recognize us.

05:55.065 --> 05:58.568
[doctor] I've never seen
anything like this before.

05:58.568 --> 06:02.652
For a woman of your age,
why, you're as fit as a fiddle!

06:02.652 --> 06:04.824
What? I mean,
that's good news, I guess.

06:04.824 --> 06:06.826
Hah! Told you
I was healthy.

06:06.826 --> 06:09.659
Truly remarkable!
Do you mind if I--

06:09.659 --> 06:11.491
-[shatters]
-Amazing.

06:11.491 --> 06:12.832
What's your secret?

06:12.832 --> 06:15.455
My secret's minding
my own business!

06:15.455 --> 06:19.089
Fair enough! I'm not worried
about you at all!

06:19.089 --> 06:21.551
However, you, sir...

06:21.551 --> 06:23.673
-[quavers] Me?
-Yes, you!

06:23.673 --> 06:25.635
I'm much more worried
about you.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.767
Signs of little sleep,

06:27.767 --> 06:30.010
overworked,
clearly stressed.

06:30.010 --> 06:32.512
I'm afraid we're going to have
to run some tests right away.

06:32.512 --> 06:33.513
Ha-ha!

06:36.726 --> 06:38.648
Eh, are you sure this'll work?

06:38.648 --> 06:40.520
I thought you said
you'd listen to me.

06:40.520 --> 06:41.731
Now, stick to the plan!

06:41.731 --> 06:43.613
There's a 45-minute wait.

06:43.613 --> 06:46.526
This brave soldier
will be dead in 45 minutes!

06:46.526 --> 06:49.029
His wounds
need attention now!

06:49.029 --> 06:50.450
-What happened?
-Uh...

06:50.450 --> 06:52.582
-He's real hurt. See?
-[screams]

06:52.582 --> 06:54.624
We're losing him!

06:54.624 --> 06:56.336
Oh, my.
Right this way, please.

06:57.457 --> 06:58.538
[both gasp]

06:58.538 --> 07:00.090
How's your zinc intake?

07:00.090 --> 07:02.132
I... five zincs a day?

07:02.132 --> 07:03.503
Don't lie to me.

07:03.503 --> 07:05.305
Eh, no! Cricket, move!

07:05.305 --> 07:06.466
-Aah!
-Huh?

07:08.508 --> 07:10.180
Hmm.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.972
[quavers]

07:13.223 --> 07:14.934
Thank you for your service.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.437
Eyesight deteriorating.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.560
The doctor
will see you now!

07:20.560 --> 07:23.153
Wow. You just keep doing
favor after favor for me.

07:23.153 --> 07:24.444
Right this way, please.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.566
I'll never forget this day!

07:26.566 --> 07:28.118
[sighs]

07:28.118 --> 07:29.529
[whirs]

07:29.529 --> 07:30.700
Cheese!

07:30.700 --> 07:32.202
When's the camera flash?

07:32.202 --> 07:34.834
Yup, that's definitely
a dislocated shoulder.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.077
Oh, no!
That sounds serious!

07:37.077 --> 07:38.999
Aw, relax,
it's no big deal.

07:38.999 --> 07:41.541
We just need
to pop your shoulder
back into place,

07:41.541 --> 07:43.003
and you'll be
just fine.

07:43.003 --> 07:45.385
<i> Hear that, Tilly?
I'm gonna be A-okay!</i>

07:45.385 --> 07:46.676
Oh, thank goodness!

07:46.676 --> 07:48.548
So he's not gonna die!

07:48.548 --> 07:50.890
<i> He must've taken
a pretty hard hit.</i>

07:50.890 --> 07:52.722
<i> -What happened?
</i>-Huh?

07:52.722 --> 07:54.684
Well, I guess
I can tell you,

07:54.684 --> 07:58.398
but this is one
of those doctor-patient
confidentiality type things.

07:58.398 --> 08:00.730
So, I was supposed
to look after Cricket,

08:00.730 --> 08:02.692
but he kept
doing crazy stuff.

08:02.692 --> 08:04.484
So I had to scare him
a little bit,

08:04.484 --> 08:06.566
but instead he got hurt
and it's all my fault,

08:06.566 --> 08:08.658
and I'm so overwhelmed
that I might fall asleep.

08:08.658 --> 08:09.609
[snoring]

08:09.609 --> 08:10.950
What? Wake up!

08:10.950 --> 08:13.493
Oh! Wow, it makes me
feel so much better

08:13.493 --> 08:14.824
to get that off my chest.

08:14.824 --> 08:16.286
<i> -What?
</i>-Cricket?

08:16.286 --> 08:17.997
-[glass squeaking]
<i> -No! No, no, no!</i>

08:17.997 --> 08:19.619
<i> You weren't supposed
to hear that!</i>

08:19.619 --> 08:21.291
I thought you were
looking after me,

08:21.291 --> 08:23.173
but you were only
looking after yourself!

08:23.173 --> 08:25.255
Shame on you!

08:25.255 --> 08:26.676
<i>Oh, that hurt real bad,</i>

08:26.676 --> 08:28.218
<i>but it was worth it
to make a point!</i>

08:28.218 --> 08:30.009
Hey! You need to give
that arm some rest.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.262
-Don't you want it to heal?
<i> -Are you kidding me?</i>

08:32.262 --> 08:34.804
This here's my evidence!

08:34.804 --> 08:35.845
<i> -Dad!
</i>-Cricket, no!

-Get back here!
-Dad! Dad! Dad!

08:38.017 --> 08:39.769
You'll never guess
what Tilly did!

08:39.769 --> 08:42.021
No, Papa,
don't listen to him!

08:42.021 --> 08:43.273
[bystanders] Huh?

08:43.273 --> 08:45.855
-[panting] Dad?
-Does my eye look funny?

08:45.855 --> 08:47.067
Uh, not Dad.

08:47.067 --> 08:48.738
[grunting] Dad?

08:48.738 --> 08:50.700
Uh, we're
on our lunch break!

08:50.700 --> 08:52.152
Not Dad.

08:52.152 --> 08:53.283
Dad?

08:53.283 --> 08:54.784
Hello.
Whoopsie!

08:54.784 --> 08:55.955
Not Dad.

08:55.955 --> 08:57.457
Dad! Dad! [gasps]

08:57.457 --> 08:58.618
There you are!

08:58.618 --> 09:00.660
Dad! Tilly broke me!
Tilly broke me!

09:00.660 --> 09:02.872
-Cricket!!!
-Aah!

09:04.164 --> 09:06.756
Haven't you
hurt me enough?

09:06.756 --> 09:07.757
Cricket, no!

09:07.757 --> 09:09.879
Just wait till Dad
hears about this!

09:09.879 --> 09:11.171
Huh?

09:12.842 --> 09:14.804
Fixed? Aw.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.677
Dad will never believe me
without proof.

09:17.677 --> 09:20.560
You mean you're
not gonna tell Papa?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.642
Tell him what,
that perfect little Tilly

09:22.642 --> 09:25.525
turned my arm into a noodle
and conspired to hide it?

09:25.525 --> 09:28.608
Yeah, right. No way
he'll believe me now.

09:28.608 --> 09:31.651
Congratulations, sister,
your reputation is safe.

09:36.286 --> 09:39.499
Papa, I gotta
tell you something.

09:39.499 --> 09:42.702
Cricket got hurt,
and it's all my fault.

09:42.702 --> 09:44.584
I wanted to impress
you so badly

09:44.584 --> 09:46.586
that I put my brother
in danger,

09:46.586 --> 09:48.588
and nothing's worth that.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.130
I'm no babysitter.

09:50.130 --> 09:51.921
I'm a baby-breaker,

09:51.921 --> 09:54.474
so give me
the sterndest, harshest,

09:54.474 --> 09:56.306

face you got,

09:56.306 --> 09:58.017

10:03.563 --> 10:05.145
Papa, oh, my gosh!
He's dead!

10:05.145 --> 10:06.316
The truth killed him!

10:06.316 --> 10:07.727
Oh, no, he's not dead.

10:07.727 --> 10:10.069
He just passed out
at the first sight of a needle.

10:10.069 --> 10:11.691
He let out
quite the scream.

10:11.691 --> 10:12.942
What did he say?

10:12.942 --> 10:14.284
"Mummy, mummy, save me.

10:14.284 --> 10:16.035
I'm a big baby." Hmm.

10:16.035 --> 10:17.287
Well, any-hoonahs,

10:17.287 --> 10:18.828
I need you
in Room Four stat.

10:18.828 --> 10:21.581
One word--
hemorrhoids.

10:23.082 --> 10:24.454
Whew! That was close.

10:24.454 --> 10:26.296
Tilly, I can't believe
you were gonna take

10:26.296 --> 10:27.877
the blame
for both of us.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.799
I gotta say, you ain't
a great babysitter...

10:29.799 --> 10:31.711
-Aw...
-But you're a great sister.

10:31.711 --> 10:32.882
Aw!

10:32.882 --> 10:34.634
Well, at least
you got a lollypop.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.095
They were out
of lollypops!

10:36.095 --> 10:38.057
My, you big baby.

10:38.057 --> 10:40.560

How are we gonna
beat 'em home?

off your bucket list?

10:50.270 --> 10:53.363
-Whoo! Yeah!
-[moos]

11:02.332 --> 11:04.164
Hey, Dad, I got
the tool you wanted!

11:04.164 --> 11:05.745
Uh, thanks, Cricket.

11:05.745 --> 11:07.167
Now, pay attention, kids.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.088
Water heaters
can be tricky things.

11:09.088 --> 11:11.791
Of course, this thing is hot,
so you gotta be real--

Oh, my gosh, Dad!

11:20.890 --> 11:23.803
[laughs] Don't worry, Cricket.
I'm fine!

11:23.803 --> 11:25.855
Nah, I was talking
about this.

11:25.855 --> 11:27.187
Dad, is this you?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.018
[chuckles] Yup.

11:29.018 --> 11:30.690
I did gymnastics
as a kid.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.772
They used to call me
Backflip Bill.

11:32.772 --> 11:34.734
Boy, that sure was fun.

11:34.734 --> 11:36.776
[Tilly] "Bill's
Power Ballad Mix"?

11:36.776 --> 11:38.778

my morning routine!

11:38.778 --> 11:39.909
This stuff is great!

11:39.909 --> 11:41.951
How come you keep it
all hidden down here?

11:41.951 --> 11:45.375
Well, I was
really looking forward
to my first big competition,

11:45.375 --> 11:47.417
but I ended up
not competing.

11:47.417 --> 11:48.538
That is so sad.

11:48.538 --> 11:49.749
What happened?

11:49.749 --> 11:50.790
It's not important.

11:50.790 --> 11:52.592
That's stuff's
all in the past.

11:52.592 --> 11:54.544
It was just a silly
childhood dream.

11:54.544 --> 11:56.966
But I'll always wonder
what would've happened

11:56.966 --> 11:58.638
if I'd gone through
with it.

11:58.638 --> 12:00.009
Maybe I could've placed,

12:00.009 --> 12:02.181
or even won.

12:02.181 --> 12:04.934
Ah! I've moved on.

12:04.934 --> 12:07.477
[low] Doesn't sound like
he's moved on to me.

12:07.477 --> 12:10.270
Papa, if you don't
follow your dreams,

12:10.270 --> 12:12.482
regrets follow you.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.113
I read
that somewhere.

12:14.113 --> 12:16.446
Look, kids, I don't want
to say any more about it.

12:16.446 --> 12:18.318
I'll say more about it!

12:18.318 --> 12:20.119
I tried to coach
that boy.

12:20.119 --> 12:22.412
We trained
for hours on end,

12:22.412 --> 12:25.625
but he just couldn't hack it
as a gymnast!

12:25.625 --> 12:26.916
Well, I guess
that's true.

12:26.916 --> 12:29.249
See? He can't even hack it
in this argument!

12:38.588 --> 12:40.590
You must've not been
a very good coach.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.342
Dad obviously
loves the sport.

12:42.342 --> 12:44.183
He's brimming with passion.

12:44.183 --> 12:46.386
Anyone could coach
such a willing athlete.

12:46.386 --> 12:48.057
You're just
a big old naysayer.

12:48.057 --> 12:49.889
You can believe
what you want,

about this, Cricket.

Come on, Dad.

13:07.867 --> 13:09.959
It's time
to get gym-nasty.

13:09.959 --> 13:12.171

just go home.

Dad, are you okay?

14:03.012 --> 14:04.594
This was a bad idea.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.175
Maybe your gramma's right.

No, she's not!

You're just

That's natural.

14:09.559 --> 14:10.930
Don't even think
about Gramma.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.570
It's not like I gave up
on him like you did.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.953
Gave up on him?
Is that what you think I did?

17:13.953 --> 17:16.205
On the contrary...

17:16.205 --> 17:19.579
<i> I believed in Bill,
just like you.</i>

17:19.579 --> 17:21.581
<i> I coached him day and night</i>

17:21.581 --> 17:24.123

into a winner.</i>

17:24.123 --> 17:27.376

and my lung capacity,</i>

17:27.376 --> 17:29.298
<i> he could've won it all,</i>

17:29.298 --> 17:31.931
<i> but how did he repay me?</i>

17:31.931 --> 17:35.514
<i> By quitting right before
his first big meet.</i>

17:35.514 --> 17:37.977
I'm just gonna go out there
and have some fun!

17:37.977 --> 17:40.850
Sure. You'll have
lots of fun, Billy Boy,

17:40.850 --> 17:43.352
if you think
it's fun to lose!

17:43.352 --> 17:47.026
Stop it, Ma! [crying]

17:48.027 --> 17:49.188
Hmm.

17:49.188 --> 17:51.651
So, you see?
He's a quitter.

17:51.651 --> 17:52.992
Simple as that.

17:52.992 --> 17:55.244
Oh, no.
What've I done?

17:55.244 --> 17:57.406
[Tilly]<i> Attention, everyone.</i>

The gymnastics competition

in five minutes.

18:01.621 --> 18:03.583
Excuse me, are you
supposed to be here?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.294
That depends.
Are you supposed

around lollygagging?

18:15.554 --> 18:16.886
Come off!

Uh, hey, Dad.

18:18.387 --> 18:21.020
Oh. Oh, uh, hey, son.

18:21.020 --> 18:23.222
Can we talk
for a second?

18:26.816 --> 18:29.899
Listen, big guy, sorry about
all the yelling and screaming.

18:29.899 --> 18:31.440
In trying to prove
Gramma wrong,

18:31.440 --> 18:33.693
I ended up making
the same mistake she did.

18:33.693 --> 18:35.034
Just face it, Cricket,

18:35.034 --> 18:37.036
I was never cut out
to be a gymnast.

18:37.036 --> 18:38.117
That's not true.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.538
You were oppressed
by coaches

18:39.538 --> 18:41.450
who sucked the fun
out of your dream.

18:41.450 --> 18:44.003
I was a bad coach,
so from now on,

18:44.003 --> 18:45.584
I'm not your coach.

18:47.246 --> 18:48.958
I'm your cheerleader!

18:48.958 --> 18:50.750
And the only thing
I'm cheering for

18:50.750 --> 18:52.421
is for you
to have fun out there.

18:52.421 --> 18:54.634
Well, that means
a lot to me, Cricket.

I'll give it another shot!

win the gold.

Nah, tungsten is

a much more practical metal
than gold, anyway.
