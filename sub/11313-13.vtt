WEBVTT

00:10.211 --> 00:13.412
I don't feel okay here.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.948
I feel like I wanna run.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.083
We've had customers
walk in the door

00:18.085 --> 00:19.985
and stop dead
in their tracks.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.456
Those things are here.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.693
I saw several dead people
standing amongst the diners.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.029
To me, they feel like a threat.

00:32.500 --> 00:37.269
I am extremely creeped out.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.405
I just hear death.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.106
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.108 --> 00:42.741
God.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.743
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

00:44.745 --> 00:45.844
I see dead people.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.112
Her face was all demonic.

00:47.114 --> 00:48.881
I speak to dead people.

00:48.883 --> 00:51.650
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

00:51.652 --> 00:53.051
And they speak to me.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.586
What is he trying to do?
Kill them.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.723
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.725
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam!

00:59.727 --> 01:01.293
I rely on my partner.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.861
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.596
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.098
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

01:06.100 --> 01:09.301
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.303 --> 01:10.469
They're everywhere.

01:10.471 --> 01:11.870
It's my job to reveal them.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.939
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

01:13.941 --> 01:16.775
But Steve and I never speak...

01:16.777 --> 01:18.777
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.012
...until the very end...

01:20.014 --> 01:21.680
Is this dead guy
doing that to her?

01:21.682 --> 01:23.549
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

01:23.551 --> 01:25.651
That's it.

01:25.653 --> 01:26.919
...or time to get out.

01:26.921 --> 01:30.088
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

01:46.307 --> 01:49.575
I'm in Sedona, Arizona,
about 2 hours from Phoenix.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.243
We got called in
by a guy named Joe.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.512
Now, he moved out here
from the East Coast

01:53.514 --> 01:56.315
and opened up a restaurant
to live the good life.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.617
Problem is,
the activity's so bad,

01:58.619 --> 02:01.186
his employees and customers
are scared to death.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.821
And he says, if we can't fix it,

02:02.823 --> 02:04.990
he may lose
his entire life savings.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.566
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the area of anything

02:14.568 --> 02:17.269
that might influence
her findings.

02:17.271 --> 02:20.105
This is a large space
with a lot of historical items

02:20.107 --> 02:23.876
and signs that need
to be covered.

02:23.878 --> 02:25.944
When I'm finished,
the location'll be ready

02:25.946 --> 02:28.947
for tonight's walk.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.430
Agh, I really
don't like it here.

02:45.432 --> 02:48.166
I feel really, really,
very sick.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.337
A lot of anxiety.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.340
And stress.

02:55.342 --> 02:59.311
I think that, if the living
spent enough time here,

02:59.313 --> 03:02.047
you know, they would
develop things like ulcers

03:02.049 --> 03:03.582
or stomach problems.

03:06.654 --> 03:11.423
I'm getting feelings
of being abandoned, unwanted.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.792
I don't feel very good here.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.201
So, Joe, when we spoke
on the phone,

03:23.203 --> 03:24.903
you sounded really
concerned about things.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.705
What's goin' on?

03:26.707 --> 03:27.940
Well, there's been
a lot of reports,

03:27.942 --> 03:30.409
by both my employees
and customers,

03:30.411 --> 03:32.811
of things happening here
in the restaurant.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.246
Okay, so that's costin'
you business.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.982
It is, indeed,
but the most important

03:36.984 --> 03:39.618
concern, in my mind, is
the safety of my guests,

03:39.620 --> 03:41.987
my customers,
and my employees.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.855
Okay. How long have you
owned the building?

03:43.857 --> 03:45.090
13 years.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.726
Okay. When did you start
havin' experiences?

03:47.728 --> 03:50.295
I haven't had
any experiences.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.863
I haven't had any
experiences here,

03:51.865 --> 03:53.565
or anywhere else
in my life.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.967
Okay. Not to be rude,

03:54.969 --> 03:56.234
but what the hell
am I doin' here, then?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.603
I believe
it's really happening.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.770
I certainly
did not believe it

03:58.772 --> 04:00.839
in the beginning,
as a skeptic,

04:00.841 --> 04:03.442
but we've had customers
walk in the door

04:03.444 --> 04:05.210
and stop dead
in their tracks.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.813
These are real people
- Right.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.582
that are having
genuine experiences.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.818
All right. Joe, I know
you've had no experiences,

04:12.820 --> 04:14.786
but what's been
reported to you?

04:14.788 --> 04:17.154
Things moving
on their own.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.757
Shadow figures
in different forms.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.392
Full-body apparitions.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.861
And also
mood changes.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.429
With all this concern
you have,

04:24.431 --> 04:25.697
why don't you just
sell the place?

04:25.699 --> 04:27.199
I'm too invested
in the place.

04:27.201 --> 04:28.734
It's a gorgeous
building.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.169
I've put many years

04:31.171 --> 04:34.740
in improving it
and in restoring it.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.875
Let me show you a photo

04:36.877 --> 04:41.113
of what the facility
used to look like.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.814
So, Joe, this must've
cost a pretty penny,

04:42.816 --> 04:44.416
for you to restore all this.

04:44.418 --> 04:47.185
It did. It cost me
my life savings.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.353
Okay.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.222
Sometimes, my partner,

04:50.224 --> 04:52.524
she'll tell a client that
it's not safe to stay here.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.226
How would you take
that information?

04:54.228 --> 04:56.395
I don't know how
I would deal with that.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.296
That would be
devastating news for me.

05:08.509 --> 05:13.979
A lot of the things that
are here are not welcoming.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.581
Everything in this room,
I despise.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.951
I don't like the flooring.
I don't like this bar.

05:19.953 --> 05:24.423
It adds too much chaos
to the environment.

05:27.428 --> 05:31.163
There's not many places where
you can go here and feel okay.

05:38.238 --> 05:41.006
I think that, for people
who are slightly sensitive,

05:41.008 --> 05:44.643
to be here would be
a **** nightmare.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.578
I don't think they would last
too long, honestly.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.914
I think it would be
a real struggle.

05:48.916 --> 05:53.618
I think they would see
a lot of stuff all the time.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.855
I think they would feel
physically horrendous.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.391
I don't wanna ****
be here right now.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.693
I- I don't feel okay
here.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.962
I feel like I wanna run.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.003
So, Karyn, I was talkin' to Joe

06:12.005 --> 06:13.572
and he was tellin' me
that you guys are partners

06:13.574 --> 06:15.040
and he's concerned
for the employees,

06:15.042 --> 06:16.908
as well as the customers
that come here.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.543
You agree with him?

06:18.545 --> 06:20.112
Yes, I do agree with him.

06:20.114 --> 06:24.216
My concern is that,
customers and employees,

06:24.218 --> 06:26.585
that they are not
fearful to be here

06:26.587 --> 06:28.787
and/or in
any type of danger.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.689
So I know Joe's never
had an experience before.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.224
What about you?

06:32.226 --> 06:34.092
Well, I did have one

06:34.094 --> 06:35.861
back here,
with one of my cooks.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.396
Okay.
- And a cup like this

06:38.398 --> 06:40.232
flew off
of that middle shelf

06:40.234 --> 06:41.867
toward us,
at the steam table.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.702
It bounced off
and broke on the floor.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.237
And nobody else was
in the kitchen at the time?

06:45.239 --> 06:47.439
- No.
- And nothin's gonna fall

06:47.441 --> 06:50.842
and fly all the way across,
at least 5-, 6-, 7-feet span.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.677
No. Not with the laws
of physics.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.179
Doesn't work that way.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.081
Well, it sounds like you had
a close call back here.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.249
That coulda been a knife

06:57.251 --> 06:58.650
and you could've been
seriously hurt.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.355
Boy.

07:03.357 --> 07:06.491
There's so many accidents here.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.195
It's abnormal.
It's not normal.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.130
It's freaking people out.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.966
People falling down, burn.

07:14.968 --> 07:18.770
You know, stupid ****
that's so constant,

07:18.772 --> 07:21.139
over and over and over again.

07:21.141 --> 07:24.109
Yeah, it's bad. You know,
it's not good, you know?

07:24.111 --> 07:27.913
It's a lot, a lot.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.415
So, have you had
any other experiences?

07:30.417 --> 07:33.885
Yes, I did, in the front
fine-dining room.

07:33.887 --> 07:37.222
Something brushed up
against the back of me.

07:37.224 --> 07:40.058
Did you get the sense it
might've been a man or a woman?

07:40.060 --> 07:42.527
No. I didn't get a sense
of an actual gender.

07:42.529 --> 07:45.764
I felt like it --
it was almost

07:45.766 --> 07:47.499
as if it was just
checking me out.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.267
All right, was the door open,
like maybe the wind?

07:49.269 --> 07:52.404
Nothing.
No staff. No one.

07:52.406 --> 07:53.839
what are you hopin' to get

07:53.841 --> 07:56.007
outta this investigation?
- I'm concerned for

07:56.009 --> 07:58.243
the customers
and employees.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.045
I want them
to feel safe.

08:00.047 --> 08:03.014
We really want you guys
to figure out

08:03.016 --> 08:05.784
what it is that's here
and get rid of it.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.855
What is that?

08:13.827 --> 08:16.094
There's a dog.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.796
But it's not a good dog.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.831
It's a bad dog!

08:21.435 --> 08:25.003
And I hear this is what they
need to be concerned about.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.240
They all feel things
brushing against them.

08:28.242 --> 08:30.408
This is this animal.

08:30.410 --> 08:33.378
It causes bad things to happen.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.280
Is it what's doin'
the stuff in here?

08:35.282 --> 08:36.548
Yes.

08:38.352 --> 08:43.221
I do think it's a possibility
that, other than just

08:43.222 --> 08:47.592
causing accidents
for living people here,

08:47.594 --> 08:50.762
I think that,
if the living have

08:50.764 --> 08:54.165
some kind of interaction
with the dog,

08:54.167 --> 08:57.836
they are possibly,
somehow, marked.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.773
To die.

09:20.043 --> 09:22.410
So, Deborah, I understand that
you're the office manager here.

09:22.412 --> 09:26.848
Yes. And I'm a healer,
a psychic, and a medium.

09:26.850 --> 09:28.550
Have you had
any experiences?

09:28.552 --> 09:30.285
Well, we had
a stretch of time here

09:30.287 --> 09:35.390
where people
were argumentative,

09:35.392 --> 09:37.792
irritable, depressed.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.928
How do you know
that this just wasn't

09:39.930 --> 09:41.863
employees bein'
in a bad mood?

09:41.865 --> 09:44.833
Well, it went on for
such an extended period

09:44.835 --> 09:47.736
and seemed to involve
so many different people,

09:47.738 --> 09:48.937
even people
who are normally,

09:48.939 --> 09:50.739
you know, even-keeled.

09:50.741 --> 09:54.476
Whether that's paranormal
or not, I don't know.

09:54.478 --> 09:55.844
Anything else?

09:55.846 --> 09:57.045
Yes, actually.

09:57.047 --> 09:59.447
I was walking through
the front dining room

09:59.449 --> 10:01.816
Okay.
- and I saw a man sitting

10:01.818 --> 10:03.251
at a table.

10:03.253 --> 10:06.187
I turned back around
to introduce myself

10:06.189 --> 10:07.288
and there was
no one there.

10:07.290 --> 10:09.224
Can you describe him for me?

10:09.226 --> 10:10.792
A little bit tall.

10:10.794 --> 10:12.627
The hair
was a little long,

10:12.629 --> 10:14.763
parted in the middle,
with wings.

10:14.765 --> 10:17.799
I could feel
his intense ownership,

10:17.801 --> 10:20.068
like he was looking
over the place

10:20.070 --> 10:21.703
or taking care of it.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.772
Okay. So now, if you saw
a sketch or a photo,

10:23.774 --> 10:25.507
would you be able
to identify him?

10:25.509 --> 10:27.909
Well, yes.
I already have.

10:27.911 --> 10:30.245
And, actually the
photograph's over there.

10:32.015 --> 10:33.515
Who is this guy?

10:33.517 --> 10:36.351
He's Henry Frank Gibson,
the former owner.

10:36.353 --> 10:37.819
That photo
is the guy you saw?

10:37.821 --> 10:40.021
Yes. And I had not
seen that photograph

10:40.023 --> 10:43.124
until several days after
I had seen the apparition.

10:47.564 --> 10:51.232
I'm seeing this larger male.

10:51.234 --> 10:54.068
He's in his 50s.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.837
His hair, a little longer,
a little.

10:55.839 --> 10:59.474
It feels like he had a lot
to do with this place.

10:59.476 --> 11:02.944
Feels like a...owner.

11:02.946 --> 11:05.814
Something weird is going on
with the dead here.

11:05.816 --> 11:07.582
There just seems to be an issue

11:07.584 --> 11:13.254
with the dead finding rest
in this specific area.

11:13.256 --> 11:17.859
The living are sensitive
and they will feel their deaths

11:17.861 --> 11:22.030
and they might not understand
what they're feeling.

11:22.032 --> 11:27.769
They would feel the sense
of dying, the dying process.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.972
I think they would also feel

11:30.974 --> 11:33.942
fear and sadness and anxious.

11:38.548 --> 11:40.582
So, Jane, I understand
that you work here.

11:40.584 --> 11:42.450
Yeah, for 5 years.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.985
Any experiences
you could tell me about?

11:43.987 --> 11:47.155
Well, yes.
When I was hosting,

11:47.157 --> 11:51.893
I sat four lovely ladies
at this very table

11:51.895 --> 11:53.595
and then I went
to the kitchen

11:53.597 --> 11:56.197
and came back and there
were only three,

11:56.199 --> 11:59.300
so I said, "Shall I wait
for the fourth one?"

11:59.302 --> 12:00.969
and they said, "No.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.204
There's only three
of us here."

12:03.206 --> 12:05.840
You sure that a fourth person
didn't come in right behind 'em

12:05.842 --> 12:07.475
and they were just
a single customer?

12:07.477 --> 12:11.112
I <i> knew.</i> I <i> knew</i>
there were four ladies.

12:11.114 --> 12:13.314
All right. So anything else?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.116
Entering the bar,
one night,

12:15.118 --> 12:19.020
an enormous, pitch-black,
triangular cape

12:19.022 --> 12:23.057
came flyin' at me from
the uppermost ceiling,

12:23.059 --> 12:25.059
down, straight at me,

12:25.061 --> 12:28.530
to the point where
I physically jumped.

12:28.532 --> 12:29.931
And then it was gone.

12:29.933 --> 12:32.500
Did it look like it was
intentionally going at you?

12:32.502 --> 12:35.003
It did, sir,
and it was frightening.

12:40.977 --> 12:44.312
There are a group of beings

12:44.314 --> 12:53.888
out here
and they are like smoke.

12:53.890 --> 12:55.623
They're not solid.

12:55.625 --> 12:58.192
You can see through them.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.829
And their eyes are lights.

13:01.831 --> 13:04.866
They made me feel uncomfortable.

13:13.877 --> 13:15.677
What?

13:15.679 --> 13:17.645
Just those things are here.

13:17.647 --> 13:20.081
- The smoky things?
- Yeah.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.950
How many of these
things are there?

13:21.952 --> 13:24.018
Four or five,
I'm thinkin'.

13:26.623 --> 13:28.189
Do you know what
these things are?

13:28.191 --> 13:31.392
I'm leaning towards
some kind of elementals.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.362
Elementals are entities
created by nature.

13:34.364 --> 13:37.098
They are not
necessarily dangerous.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.399
But these are.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.034
To me, they feel
like a threat.

13:48.812 --> 13:50.678
Heather, I understand
that you used to work here.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.748
Yes, I did.
I was a hostess, server.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.950
So, I assume you've had
experiences, then.

13:55.952 --> 13:57.552
Yes.
- Okay. Can you take me

13:57.554 --> 13:58.886
through some of 'em?

13:58.888 --> 14:00.955
I did feel some anxiety,

14:00.957 --> 14:03.424
just a tightness,
being in here.

14:03.426 --> 14:06.561
I can hear and feel
energies around me.

14:06.563 --> 14:09.530
I'm very sensitive
if there's another being,

14:09.532 --> 14:13.901
apparition, or energy.

14:13.903 --> 14:15.536
Okay.
So, anything else?

14:15.538 --> 14:18.373
I was in the bar area,
carrying trays,

14:18.375 --> 14:22.310
and telling a gentlemen,
"Excuse me,"

14:22.312 --> 14:25.146
standing in my way,
wearing a plaid shirt.

14:25.148 --> 14:27.615
And I look.
There's nobody there.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.651
Okay. So can you
describe that person?

14:29.653 --> 14:33.021
Gruffy,
rough-looking, dirty.

14:33.023 --> 14:34.689
Have you seen him again
since that time?

14:34.691 --> 14:37.091
Yes.
In the kitchen area.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.593
I don't know,
'cause it's being New Age,

14:38.595 --> 14:40.194
or this is a woo-woo
type of town,

14:40.196 --> 14:43.865
but everybody seems to take
what's goin' on here kinda

14:43.867 --> 14:47.902
"We got ghosts, they throw
things, no big deal."

14:47.904 --> 14:49.971
This is what
goes on here.

14:49.973 --> 14:53.041
Okay.
So, anything else?

14:53.043 --> 14:55.143
When I would go and serve
in the dining room,

14:55.145 --> 14:57.011
I saw several
dead people

14:57.013 --> 14:59.013
standing
amongst the diners.

14:59.015 --> 15:00.848
How many people
you talkin'?

15:00.850 --> 15:02.784
5 to 12.

15:02.786 --> 15:04.285
How many times
has this happened?

15:04.287 --> 15:06.387
A few times, serving
in the dining room.

15:06.389 --> 15:07.689
I would almost
drop my tray,

15:07.691 --> 15:08.823
trying to move
around someone,

15:08.825 --> 15:10.024
thinking
that they're there,

15:10.026 --> 15:11.526
and then, all of a sudden,
they're gone.

15:11.528 --> 15:14.429
I- It made me
pretty uncomfortable,

15:14.431 --> 15:16.264
to encounter
something like that.

15:21.171 --> 15:27.008
I am extremely
creeped out.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.309
What's happening?

15:28.311 --> 15:33.848
Anybody who's died here
is set up like mannequins.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.617
There's people
in these chairs.

15:40.290 --> 15:42.757
But they're dead.

15:42.759 --> 15:45.026
It looks like their
physical bodies are here

15:45.028 --> 15:48.529
and their soul is stuck
in their physical body

15:48.531 --> 15:53.034
and they've been like
propped up like mannequins.

15:55.672 --> 15:59.440
They can't talk or move.

15:59.442 --> 16:02.110
I think the living
would maybe see this.

16:02.112 --> 16:05.012
This is
cree-ee-py.

16:05.014 --> 16:07.381
I don't like it.

16:22.105 --> 16:23.972
Joe didn't know much history
about his restaurant,

16:23.974 --> 16:25.273
so I made some calls

16:25.275 --> 16:28.209
and, it turns out, a guy
named George Nelson got shot

16:28.211 --> 16:31.613
and ended up dyin' in his
parking lot back in 1957.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.015
I managed to track down
the victim's nephew,

16:34.017 --> 16:36.284
who says, even though
this is still an open case,

16:36.286 --> 16:38.620
he's got his own theory
about what actually happened.

16:44.828 --> 16:49.064
So, Dan, before we get
to your uncle's tragic death,

16:49.066 --> 16:50.865
what can you
tell me about him?

16:50.867 --> 16:52.534
Here's a picture of him,
probably from when

16:52.536 --> 16:54.202
he was a senior
in high school.

16:54.204 --> 16:56.137
He was just friendly,
nice.

16:56.139 --> 16:57.772
Not an enemy
in the world.

16:57.774 --> 16:59.441
All right, Dan,
so, if you can,

16:59.443 --> 17:00.975
take me through the night
of the murder. What happened?

17:00.977 --> 17:04.346
It happened
May 25, 1957,

17:04.348 --> 17:05.847
by the bar that
you're investigating.

17:05.848 --> 17:08.282
Rainbow's End was what
it was called back then.

17:08.285 --> 17:10.251
My uncle was with a couple
of his friends,

17:10.252 --> 17:12.053
a couple of his buddies,
then there was

17:12.055 --> 17:14.589
two younger girls
that they had picked up.

17:14.590 --> 17:16.891
They all piled
in the car.

17:16.893 --> 17:19.027
My uncle was in the
passenger seat up front.

17:19.029 --> 17:20.627
Okay.
- And one of his friends

17:20.630 --> 17:22.497
was driving and then
the other guy was

17:22.499 --> 17:24.598
in the backseat,
between the two girls.

17:24.601 --> 17:26.101
One thing you should know
is the friend

17:26.103 --> 17:27.402
who was driving
was married

17:27.404 --> 17:30.605
and the guy who was in the
back had a girlfriend.

17:30.607 --> 17:34.409
They'd just left
Rainbow's End

17:34.411 --> 17:36.144
and they passed by a car

17:36.146 --> 17:37.912
that was sittin' on the
side of the road.

17:37.914 --> 17:39.781
All of a sudden,
the car pulls up bes--

17:39.783 --> 17:41.416
behind 'em,
started following.

17:41.418 --> 17:43.385
George turned around
to the guy in the backseat

17:43.387 --> 17:45.320
and said,
"You'd better duck down,

17:45.322 --> 17:46.855
'cause your girlfriend's
followin' us."

17:46.857 --> 17:48.623
So your uncle
recognized the car?

17:48.625 --> 17:51.393
Yes. All of a sudden,
boom! Gunshot.

17:51.395 --> 17:53.895
The back window shattered.
It hit my uncle in the head.

17:53.897 --> 17:57.365
There's brains everywhere,
total chaos.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.534
Witnesses told me that
they saw my uncle

17:59.536 --> 18:02.270
"gurgling" on the
floorboards of the car,

18:02.272 --> 18:03.805
so, even though his brains
were blown apart,

18:03.807 --> 18:05.473
he was still alive.

18:05.475 --> 18:06.674
You know, his body
was still alive.

18:06.676 --> 18:08.510
He was breathing.
And they turned around

18:08.512 --> 18:11.112
and went back
to Rainbow's End,

18:11.114 --> 18:14.115
but, by then, it was
too late. He was dead.

18:14.117 --> 18:15.683
I have a copy of

18:15.685 --> 18:17.652
my uncle's death
certificate right here.

18:21.825 --> 18:23.358
So do you think
this girl intended

18:23.360 --> 18:25.160
to kill somebody
in that car?

18:25.162 --> 18:26.694
I think she was actually
just trying to scare them

18:26.696 --> 18:29.931
and my uncle died
because of it.

18:29.933 --> 18:32.667
So, officially,
George Nelson's murder

18:32.669 --> 18:34.502
is unsolved, to this day.

18:39.276 --> 18:42.610
There's some kind of
gunfight.

18:42.612 --> 18:45.380
I feel like somebody
got shot with a shotgun.

18:49.286 --> 18:50.952
It's a guy and he's young.

18:54.157 --> 18:56.224
It takes him a while to die.

19:01.531 --> 19:04.332
It hurts.
It horribly hurts.

19:04.334 --> 19:06.935
It hurts so **** bad.

19:17.147 --> 19:19.214
So far, I've got
a restaurant owner scared

19:19.216 --> 19:22.584
for the safety of his employees
and guests, on a property

19:22.586 --> 19:25.320
where a man died of a gunshot
wound to the head.

19:25.322 --> 19:27.489
But I wanna see
if there's anything else.

19:27.491 --> 19:30.091
Searchin' through old records,
I find an article

19:30.093 --> 19:33.094
about a local man
who died in 2006.

19:33.096 --> 19:34.829
Turns out, he was run over
by a car

19:34.831 --> 19:36.531
right outside
my client's property.

19:39.769 --> 19:41.769
I'm on my way to meet
with the county sheriff,

19:41.771 --> 19:44.772
who says the victim used to be
a regular at Joe's restaurant.

19:52.549 --> 19:53.915
So, this guy that got killed

19:53.917 --> 19:55.583
right outside
my client's restaurant,

19:55.585 --> 19:57.752
did you find out
anything about him?

19:57.754 --> 20:00.054
Actually, I have a photo
of him right here.

20:00.056 --> 20:02.090
Randy Lee Austin.

20:02.092 --> 20:03.658
54 years old.

20:03.660 --> 20:07.662
He was kind of a drifter.
Came to Sedona in 2005.

20:07.664 --> 20:10.265
He would spend
a lot of time at Relics.

20:10.267 --> 20:12.667
What about the day of his death?
What happened?

20:12.669 --> 20:15.803
April 4, 2006,
he went to Relics,

20:15.805 --> 20:17.171
spent some time there

20:17.173 --> 20:18.907
at your client's
establishment.

20:18.909 --> 20:21.075
Okay.
- And, as it got dark,

20:21.077 --> 20:22.710
he left the bar.
A couple witnesses

20:22.712 --> 20:24.646
had seem him
crossing the street.

20:24.648 --> 20:27.115
Another witness said
he saw him gettin' down,

20:27.117 --> 20:29.817
actually just laying down,
facedown, on the street,

20:29.819 --> 20:33.221
when an oncoming car
skidded right over

20:33.223 --> 20:35.356
the top of him,
killing him instantly.

20:35.358 --> 20:38.226
Here is a copy

20:38.228 --> 20:42.063
of the obituary
in the newspaper.

20:42.065 --> 20:43.765
Why would he be laying down
on the road, though?

20:43.767 --> 20:45.700
Well, he was
an alcoholic.

20:50.006 --> 20:51.806
I'm getting another death here.

20:54.611 --> 20:57.612
There's something
about a car accident.

21:03.286 --> 21:06.487
Somebody **** up
their back, bad.

21:06.489 --> 21:08.723
So **** bad.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.692
My God.

21:10.694 --> 21:13.661
I think the dog foretells
accidents and stuff,

21:13.663 --> 21:15.396
that it likes to do that.

21:20.103 --> 21:22.637
I think that, if the living

21:22.639 --> 21:25.206
encounter the dog,
in some fashion,

21:25.208 --> 21:28.109
like it could be
like a harbinger

21:28.111 --> 21:29.844
of death.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.883
If the living see
or hear this dog,

21:35.885 --> 21:39.687
it means they're
going to die soon.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.522
But it doesn't mean
they're gonna die here,

21:41.524 --> 21:43.725
like the car accident thing.

21:43.727 --> 21:46.194
But it seems like some people

21:46.196 --> 21:49.897
who start their dying process
here or who die here,

21:49.899 --> 21:52.333
you're either stuck
in your death state

21:52.335 --> 21:55.036
or you're like turned
into a mannequin.

22:03.980 --> 22:05.313
If you need us to investigate

22:05.315 --> 22:07.215
unexplained activity
in your home,

22:07.217 --> 22:10.284
go to the "Dead Files" page
at travelchannel.com.

22:10.286 --> 22:11.552
Click on "Help me,
Dead Files!"

22:11.554 --> 22:12.854
to submit your story
and we'll help if we can.

22:24.192 --> 22:25.492
You could pretty much
throw a dart

22:25.494 --> 22:27.861
at a map of the U.S.
and you'll hit a spot

22:27.863 --> 22:29.996
where the Native Americans
got the shaft.

22:29.998 --> 22:31.331
It's no different here.

22:31.333 --> 22:33.266
I'm on my way to meet
with an author who's going to

22:33.268 --> 22:35.635
tell me about what the locals
call The Removal.

22:43.512 --> 22:45.512
So, Melissa, thanks for
helpin' me out with this case.

22:45.514 --> 22:47.180
Before we get to The Removal,

22:47.182 --> 22:48.948
who were the
Native Americans here?

22:48.950 --> 22:50.784
Okay, there were two
basic tribes in the area.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.119
They were the Yavapai
and the Apache

22:53.121 --> 22:54.688
and they both came in
about the same time,

22:54.690 --> 22:57.057
about the mid-1400s.

22:57.059 --> 22:59.359
After the Civil War,
late 1860s,

22:59.361 --> 23:02.462
people started pushing West,
so, first, the miners

23:02.464 --> 23:04.631
came in, looking
for gold and silver,

23:04.633 --> 23:07.300
and then, right after them
came white settlers.

23:07.302 --> 23:09.169
Okay. So how'd that go?

23:09.171 --> 23:10.670
Well, it didn't go
very well.

23:10.672 --> 23:13.273
There were minor clashes
here and there,

23:13.275 --> 23:17.577
until 1872 and the
Skeleton Cave Massacre.

23:17.579 --> 23:18.745
Okay, so what happened there?

23:18.747 --> 23:20.780
The soldiers were told
to round up

23:20.782 --> 23:22.182
all the Yavapai
and Apache

23:22.184 --> 23:23.917
and bring them
to the new reservation.

23:23.919 --> 23:25.652
They heard that
there were some Apache

23:25.654 --> 23:27.587
held up in a cave.

23:27.589 --> 23:29.456
They went to get them
and they fought back.

23:29.458 --> 23:31.191
How many did they kill?

23:31.193 --> 23:33.927
Well, they killed
75 Indians

23:33.929 --> 23:35.462
and they captured
probably 30.

23:35.464 --> 23:36.863
That's brutal.

23:36.865 --> 23:38.631
That was brutal.
As a matter of fact,

23:38.633 --> 23:42.802
this picture is
of the cave in 1908.

23:42.804 --> 23:44.671
So these bones were there
this whole time?

23:44.673 --> 23:46.539
They were there
the whole time.

23:46.541 --> 23:47.841
And, of course,
a lot of the bones

23:47.843 --> 23:49.809
were scattered
by wild animals.

23:49.811 --> 23:52.545
So the next plan,
in 1875,

23:52.547 --> 23:56.516
was to march them
180 miles south to the

23:56.518 --> 23:59.119
San Carlos reservation,
close to Phoenix.

23:59.121 --> 24:01.087
For whatever reason,
they decided to do this

24:01.089 --> 24:02.389
in February.

24:02.391 --> 24:04.991
1,500 people
started the march

24:04.993 --> 24:07.560
and hundreds died
along the way.

24:07.562 --> 24:10.897
I'm curious 'cause,
Native Americans,

24:10.899 --> 24:12.599
the way they bury people
is pretty sacred.

24:12.601 --> 24:14.167
What happened with the dead
along the trail?

24:14.169 --> 24:15.301
They were not allowed

24:15.303 --> 24:17.003
to stop and take care
of the dead.

24:17.005 --> 24:18.872
They were forced
to just leave the dead,

24:18.874 --> 24:21.107
or probably
sick or injured,

24:21.109 --> 24:23.309
where they lay
and just keep marching.

24:23.311 --> 24:24.778
That's pretty nasty.

24:24.780 --> 24:27.914
It is, yeah. And,
unfortunately, the whites

24:27.916 --> 24:30.150
didn't have much empathy
for the Indians, you know?

24:30.152 --> 24:33.186
They had trouble
seeing them as "human."

24:40.328 --> 24:43.263
A Native American
came up to me.

24:43.265 --> 24:46.833
I'm feeling
a lot of people,

24:46.835 --> 24:48.101
being disturbed.

24:48.103 --> 24:52.105
They're not
being able to rest.

24:52.107 --> 24:53.406
This isn't right.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.842
This is wrong.
They're very unhappy.

24:55.844 --> 24:57.110
They're very sad.

24:57.112 --> 24:58.778
There's a lot of crying.

24:58.780 --> 25:00.513
Do you know what happened
to the dead here?

25:00.515 --> 25:05.652
It was over a period of time
and they were happy, dead,

25:05.654 --> 25:10.390
and then something happened
and they woke up

25:10.392 --> 25:14.994
and then they were disturbed
and they're unhappy and crying.

25:14.996 --> 25:16.930
Do you have any idea
of when this happened?

25:16.932 --> 25:19.132
It was dirt.

25:19.134 --> 25:20.967
Long time ago.

25:20.969 --> 25:25.939
There's so much illness
and mental anguish.

25:25.941 --> 25:29.042
I'm feeling a lot of panic
back here, a lot of chaos.

25:31.813 --> 25:35.882
I feel like the living
who are here a lot,

25:35.884 --> 25:38.818
they could form disorders.

25:38.820 --> 25:40.954
And I mean like
full-on disorders,

25:40.956 --> 25:43.490
like general-anxiety disorders.

25:43.492 --> 25:45.592
Severe stomach issues
would develop.

25:45.594 --> 25:48.228
Esophagus issues would develop.

25:48.230 --> 25:50.763
This is bad.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.304
I saw several disturbing
things on my walk,

25:58.306 --> 26:00.807
but the dead people
propped up like mannequins

26:00.809 --> 26:04.410
in the dining room
had me the most concerned.

26:04.412 --> 26:08.681
It's dark
and they can't move.

26:08.683 --> 26:11.784
They're trapped
inside their bodies?

26:11.786 --> 26:15.188
And their eyes were
very scary to me.

26:15.190 --> 26:18.591
They were extremely intense.

26:27.035 --> 26:29.569
Is this what you saw?

26:29.571 --> 26:31.104
Yes, that's what I saw.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.512
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:55.514 --> 26:57.614
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

26:57.616 --> 27:00.450
and our clients
for the first time.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.619
So, Amy,
I want you to meet Joe.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.221
You wanna know how many
experiences he's had?

27:05.223 --> 27:07.123
Zero. None.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.558
Reason he's called us in is

27:08.560 --> 27:11.161
because of people like Deborah,
who's his office manager;

27:11.163 --> 27:14.331
and Heather, who worked here
for a few years.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.399
They've had a lot
of experiences.

27:16.401 --> 27:19.069
Joe thinks the paranormal
is costing him business,

27:19.071 --> 27:21.771
but his biggest concern
is the safety

27:21.773 --> 27:24.341
for his customers
and his employees.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.575
He wants to know
what the hell is here

27:25.577 --> 27:27.577
and how to get rid of it.

27:27.579 --> 27:29.612
So now that I told Amy
a little bit about you guys,

27:29.614 --> 27:32.882
I'm gonna have her
describe her walk.

27:32.884 --> 27:37.087
When I arrived,
I was very distracted

27:37.089 --> 27:41.358
by a lot of chaotic
and confusing energy.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.628
It had to do
with random objects.

27:45.630 --> 27:50.066
Specifically, the wood
flooring was bothersome.

27:50.068 --> 27:56.740
The bar and some objects
on display in the back room,

27:56.742 --> 28:00.910
these items were
emitting chaotic energy

28:00.912 --> 28:05.315
and it just added
to the overall

28:05.317 --> 28:08.551
intense energy
of this location.

28:08.553 --> 28:10.286
Amy, there's a few things
you should know about Joe

28:10.288 --> 28:11.688
and this place.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.123
Now, you were talkin' about
the floor and the bar.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.891
Joe and his business
partner, Karyn,

28:14.893 --> 28:17.861
did extensive renovations
on this place

28:17.863 --> 28:19.929
when they bought it
about 13 years ago.

28:19.931 --> 28:22.499
Joe sank his life
savings into it.

28:22.501 --> 28:26.803
This what the bar
used to look like before.

28:26.805 --> 28:28.905
This is circa 1980.
- Wow.

28:28.907 --> 28:30.540
Obviously,
just from comin' in here,

28:30.542 --> 28:33.510
you can see the huge amount
of work that was done.

28:33.512 --> 28:34.911
Interesting.

28:34.913 --> 28:36.446
That makes a lot of sense.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.684
So, during my walk,

28:41.686 --> 28:45.755
I'm getting sicker
and sicker and drained.

28:45.757 --> 28:49.325
I do think that living
individuals here

28:49.327 --> 28:53.163
might feel some
of that at times,

28:53.165 --> 28:57.066
because there's a lot of stress,
a lot of anxiety.

28:57.068 --> 28:59.903
And what I got,
in extreme cases,

28:59.905 --> 29:03.339
so if you're here consistently
or if you're really sensitive,

29:03.341 --> 29:07.677
you could develop some
stomach problems, like ulcers.

29:07.679 --> 29:08.978
Amy, there's something
you should know about

29:08.980 --> 29:11.514
the two ladies
on both sides of Joe.

29:11.516 --> 29:14.050
Both of them are sensitives

29:14.052 --> 29:16.553
and both of them have
spent a lot of time here.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.588
Now, we didn't discuss sickness

29:18.590 --> 29:20.089
when I interviewed
both you ladies,

29:20.091 --> 29:23.860
but anxiety and stress
was definitely a thing.

29:23.862 --> 29:26.729
I agree with the stress
and the anxiety.

29:26.731 --> 29:28.765
Just so much pressure,

29:28.767 --> 29:32.569
so much energy coming
at you all at once.

29:32.571 --> 29:37.440
Deborah, you talked to me about
the bad vibes in this place.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.042
There was
a extended period

29:39.044 --> 29:41.077
where there were
a lot of dissension,

29:41.079 --> 29:44.647
a lot of arguments, a lot
of customer complaints,

29:44.649 --> 29:47.350
and it was going on
amongst many people

29:47.352 --> 29:49.486
for a prolonged period,
and even among people

29:49.488 --> 29:52.388
who are normally
eventempered.

29:52.390 --> 29:53.623
Interesting.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.226
Okay, so what else
on the walk?

29:56.228 --> 30:00.497
So, I went into the kitchen

30:00.499 --> 30:02.632
and what I saw happening
in the kitchen

30:02.634 --> 30:06.035
were a lot of ridiculous
accidents

30:06.037 --> 30:10.273
and the thing that was causing
these accidents was a dead dog.

30:10.275 --> 30:13.343
I got that it
is extremely negative

30:13.345 --> 30:18.047
and it's been here
for a <i> very</i> long time.

30:18.049 --> 30:21.317
The living might feel it
brush up against them.

30:21.319 --> 30:24.921
They might feel weight against
them, causing them to move.

30:24.923 --> 30:29.792
If people encounter the dog
and they see it or they hear it,

30:29.794 --> 30:34.597
that could actually indicate
that that person might die.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.137
It doesn't cause
someone to die,

30:41.139 --> 30:47.076
but it could possibly
foretell their death.

30:47.078 --> 30:49.646
You're talkin' about
accidents in the kitchen.

30:49.648 --> 30:51.748
Joe, tell Amy

30:51.750 --> 30:54.450
what happened
to Karyn with the cup.

30:54.452 --> 30:59.489
Karyn actually experienced
a cup fly across the room

30:59.491 --> 31:01.558
and she was in there
with one of her cooks

31:01.560 --> 31:03.326
and they both saw it.

31:03.328 --> 31:05.595
Now, she also told somethin'
'bout her gettin'...

31:05.597 --> 31:08.464
Brushed behind her,
that's correct.

31:08.466 --> 31:10.700
She was just walking
through

31:10.702 --> 31:12.769
the dining room up front.

31:12.771 --> 31:15.905
and she experienced
something behind her

31:15.907 --> 31:17.907
that she could sense
very clearly,

31:17.909 --> 31:19.642
but nothing was there
when she looked.

31:19.644 --> 31:21.077
Boy.

31:21.079 --> 31:23.646
That's not good.

31:25.784 --> 31:28.484
So what else?

31:28.486 --> 31:30.920
There were a couple of people
that I encountered

31:30.922 --> 31:33.856
who seemed to be stuck
in their death states

31:33.858 --> 31:37.493
and reliving their deaths
over and over and over again.

31:37.495 --> 31:42.098
I encountered one individual
in the bar area.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.967
This was a younger male.

31:43.969 --> 31:46.669
I got that this person was shot

31:46.671 --> 31:51.841
and it felt like my insides
were just ripped apart.

31:51.843 --> 31:54.644
It was <i> extremely</i> painful.

31:54.646 --> 31:59.148
I know that it took quite
some time to die from this.

31:59.150 --> 32:01.317
Somethin' I came across
in my research,

32:01.319 --> 32:04.020
there was a guy who was shot

32:04.022 --> 32:06.689
and then died
in the parkin' lot right here.

32:06.691 --> 32:09.292
This happened
on May 25, 1957.

32:09.294 --> 32:11.027
19-year-old
George Nelson came here

32:11.029 --> 32:13.129
with some friends for a drink.

32:13.131 --> 32:14.597
I actually have
a picture of him.

32:16.067 --> 32:18.968
So, now, when they finished
drinking here,

32:18.970 --> 32:21.838
George, two guys, and two girls
piled into a car

32:21.840 --> 32:23.206
and started to leave.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.908
Guy in the front seat
that was driving was married.

32:25.910 --> 32:28.945
And the guy sitting
in the back had a girlfriend.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.913
During the drive, George noticed
that there was a car

32:30.915 --> 32:33.416
following 'em
right outside here.

32:33.418 --> 32:34.550
Before he could do anything,

32:34.552 --> 32:37.453
a shot went through
the back windshield.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.688
He was struck in the head
by the bullet,

32:38.690 --> 32:39.822
but it didn't kill him
right away.

32:39.824 --> 32:43.593
They drove back here
to the parkin' lot

32:43.595 --> 32:47.363
and he wound up goin' DOA here.

32:47.365 --> 32:50.600
gunshot wound to the head.

32:52.904 --> 32:58.241
Now, the case is still unsolved,
but I spoke to George's nephew.

32:58.243 --> 33:01.978
He thinks that the car
that followed them belonged

33:01.980 --> 33:04.881
to the girlfriend
of one of the guys in the car.

33:04.883 --> 33:06.215
According to him,
the girl was jealous

33:06.217 --> 33:08.484
and she mighta been
tryin' to scare them,

33:08.486 --> 33:09.752
wound up killin' a guy.

33:09.754 --> 33:12.655
But she was never questioned
about the shooting.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.457
Wow.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.362
So I'm back in the kitchen

33:19.364 --> 33:21.798
and I felt that there
was another death.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.801
It had to do with something
with the dog.

33:24.803 --> 33:28.738
I got that there
was a car accident,

33:28.740 --> 33:33.042
their back
was horribly damaged.

33:33.044 --> 33:36.412
I was in so much pain at the
time that I had to kneel down.

33:36.414 --> 33:42.485
I got that this happened
very close to this location.

33:42.487 --> 33:43.553
I think I know
what she's talkin' about.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.054
I'm pretty sure you do.

33:45.056 --> 33:46.322
There was a car accident
that happened

33:46.324 --> 33:49.826
right on the street here
next to Relics back in 2006.

33:49.828 --> 33:54.130
Randy Austin, he was
a regular customer here.

33:54.132 --> 33:57.467
I've got a photo.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.969
Now, he drank here all the time,
pretty much every day.

33:59.971 --> 34:01.904
We found out he was a drifter,
kind of a homeless guy,

34:01.906 --> 34:03.539
here and there.

34:03.541 --> 34:07.543
On April 4, 2006,
after a long day of drinking,

34:07.545 --> 34:09.579
he walked out of the bar

34:09.581 --> 34:11.880
and laid facedown on the road,
for some reason.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.315
What?

34:13.318 --> 34:14.917
Now, it's pitch-black out there.

34:14.918 --> 34:17.353
Oncoming car didn't him
until it was too late.

34:17.355 --> 34:19.489
It ran right over him.
- My --

34:19.491 --> 34:20.989
He died at the scene.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.225
Now, the driver was cleared.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.494
It was obviously an accident.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.429
He was known
by a lot of people

34:26.431 --> 34:29.165
and it was a very sad
incident when that occurred.

34:29.167 --> 34:32.668
No one really understood
why he did that, either.

34:32.670 --> 34:36.272
So, Amy, do you think
that's the same guy?

34:36.274 --> 34:39.141
It could be.

34:39.143 --> 34:41.577
Which is awful.

34:41.579 --> 34:44.013
If it is him,
it's unfortunate

34:44.014 --> 34:47.449
because he would be stuck
in his death state.

34:51.656 --> 34:54.422
Okay, so we've got accidents.
We got shootings.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.159
What else?

34:56.161 --> 35:01.631
I went into the area that is
kinda like decorated Victorian.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.900
Which is that front dining room.

35:03.902 --> 35:10.473
And there were these
smoky, grayish, blackish,

35:10.475 --> 35:15.344
foggy things
that had light for eyes.

35:19.083 --> 35:21.818
Aaaaah!

35:21.820 --> 35:23.920
What?

35:23.922 --> 35:26.055
Just, those things are here.

35:28.326 --> 35:31.894
I kinda pride myself on not
being afraid of too many things

35:31.896 --> 35:34.163
and this just really
caught me off-guard.

35:34.165 --> 35:35.631
What are these things?

35:35.633 --> 35:39.569
They're elementals, which means
they were never alive.

35:39.571 --> 35:43.739
And then, at the tables,
I saw like

35:43.741 --> 35:46.542
what initially I thought
were mannequins

35:46.544 --> 35:48.678
and there were
about 10 of 'em.

35:48.680 --> 35:53.716
And then I hear the screaming
and I'm like "Okay."

35:53.718 --> 36:00.756
What I got was that these
entities had, over <i> many</i> years,

36:00.758 --> 36:04.460
collected several
deceased people

36:04.462 --> 36:08.397
and, unfortunately through
that collecting process,

36:08.399 --> 36:16.372
they have trapped them here,
their souls and their bodies.

36:16.374 --> 36:18.441
- All right.
- Walking into the dining room,

36:18.443 --> 36:19.508
- Yeah.
- what did I see?

36:19.510 --> 36:21.878
- Yeah, tell her.
- People just --

36:21.880 --> 36:23.446
between 5 and 12,

36:23.448 --> 36:26.649
just standing
amongst the diners,

36:26.651 --> 36:28.918
for no reason.

36:28.920 --> 36:32.255
It was
an uncomfortable feeling.

36:32.257 --> 36:34.223
I did have a sketch done.

36:34.225 --> 36:37.693
Frankly, I did find it
very disturbing.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.029
I would not spend
a long time in that room.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.797
It absolutely creeped me out.

36:47.972 --> 36:49.472
I don't know if you guys
wanna go back in that room

36:49.474 --> 36:50.640
after seein' this.

37:04.289 --> 37:05.655
I recognize it.

37:05.657 --> 37:06.923
Really?

37:06.925 --> 37:08.324
Yeah.

37:08.326 --> 37:10.192
I've seen
this sort of thing

37:10.194 --> 37:13.863
many, many times,
over and over again.

37:13.865 --> 37:17.633
It's like something
from a horror movie.

37:17.635 --> 37:20.303
This means a lot,
that you've seen this,

37:20.305 --> 37:24.073
because I can't share this
with other people.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.910
So what do these smoky creatures
want with the dead people?

37:27.912 --> 37:32.782
They're collecting them because
they think they're beautiful.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.150
Like they're dolls.

37:34.152 --> 37:35.918
They just put 'em
where they want 'em.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.187
- Like a toy to them.
- Yeah.

37:38.189 --> 37:42.892
And you believe
that those individuals

37:42.894 --> 37:46.696
may be these individuals?

37:46.698 --> 37:48.297
I think it's highly likely.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.803
So, Deborah, I noticed
you got a little emotional.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.305
Well, I think
the suffering

37:56.307 --> 37:59.809
of those souls needs
to be addressed.

37:59.811 --> 38:02.912
Joe, it looks like you
called us in just in time.

38:02.914 --> 38:05.047
It is bad.
It's really bad.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.009
So, Joe,
I know you're a skeptic,

38:25.011 --> 38:27.579
but you gotta be pretty blown
away by what you heard tonight.

38:27.581 --> 38:29.814
- Absolutely.
- Now comes the hard part.

38:29.816 --> 38:32.283
We're gonna find out
what it's gonna take for you

38:32.285 --> 38:34.319
to make your restaurant
safe again

38:34.321 --> 38:35.987
and, for that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

38:40.827 --> 38:44.329
The first thing
is the residual energy.

38:44.331 --> 38:49.968
The entire location needs to be
cleaned, from top to bottom,

38:49.970 --> 38:56.508
I'm thinking about one time
per month, for 6 months.

38:56.510 --> 39:00.245
I know that's a big job,
but this is the best thing

39:00.247 --> 39:03.748
to remove all of this
collected energy.

39:03.750 --> 39:05.950
And then, once that's done,

39:05.952 --> 39:09.053
a shaman and a medium need
to be contacted,

39:09.055 --> 39:12.390
who are willing
to work together.

39:12.392 --> 39:16.428
What I would like the shaman
to do is to perform a ritual

39:16.430 --> 39:21.666
to reach out to the elementals,
to appease them.

39:21.668 --> 39:26.004
Once that ritual's completed,
the medium needs to step in

39:26.006 --> 39:28.406
and help any
of the deceased individuals

39:28.408 --> 39:30.842
who don't go on their own.

39:30.844 --> 39:32.777
Many will probably just leave,

39:32.779 --> 39:36.281
but some might be a little
stunned, confused,

39:36.283 --> 39:40.318
and the medium may need to
assist them in moving them on.

39:40.320 --> 39:41.920
Will the dog go, too?

39:41.922 --> 39:43.888
Yes.

39:43.890 --> 39:45.223
So, when the shaman
comes in,

39:45.225 --> 39:47.659
is he gonna get rid
of these smoky things?

39:47.661 --> 39:51.029
No. What he or she
will do is

39:51.031 --> 39:56.634
a ritual that will send
a clear message and intention

39:56.636 --> 40:00.505
that they are being
acknowledged,

40:00.507 --> 40:05.877
that respect will now be given,
that we understand

40:05.879 --> 40:08.947
what they've been through,
and things of that nature.

40:08.949 --> 40:10.148
All right.
So they'll stay here,

40:10.150 --> 40:11.850
but they're not gonna trap
any more souls.

40:11.852 --> 40:14.786
Correct.

40:14.788 --> 40:17.255
They'll leave, but these
guys are still here,

40:17.257 --> 40:18.656
with the scary eyes,

40:18.658 --> 40:22.093
shootin' down
in my dining room?

40:22.095 --> 40:24.596
Unfortunately, yes.

40:24.598 --> 40:27.465
So people may see these
things, living people?

40:27.467 --> 40:31.336
I think, if they're
sensitive, yeah.

40:31.338 --> 40:34.906
Then, after that,
at least once a week,

40:34.908 --> 40:38.710
you need to make an offering
to the elementals.

40:38.712 --> 40:42.347
And my suggestion is to go
to one of the local

40:42.349 --> 40:46.718
metaphysical stores and,
whatever you feel pulled to,

40:46.720 --> 40:50.655
that's them letting you know,
"This is what we want."

40:50.657 --> 40:53.992
So you bring that object
back and you say,

40:53.994 --> 40:55.426
"This is now for you"

40:55.428 --> 40:59.931
and you can select an area
to place the object in.

40:59.933 --> 41:02.901
So as far as the cleansing,
once a month for 6 months,

41:02.903 --> 41:03.902
how will it feel
for them?

41:03.904 --> 41:05.904
Yeah.
It's gonna be good.

41:05.906 --> 41:07.205
Good energy.

41:07.207 --> 41:11.309
I'm very pleased that all
of this came out.

41:11.311 --> 41:13.578
I'm willing to try it.

41:13.580 --> 41:14.946
So, Joe, I know
you put your heart

41:14.948 --> 41:17.582
and soul into this place
and it means everything to you.

41:17.584 --> 41:20.018
As far as all this stuff
Amy suggests to do,

41:20.020 --> 41:22.921
are you gonna
take that task on?

41:22.923 --> 41:25.890
Absolutely.

41:25.892 --> 41:28.626
It's too easy.

41:28.628 --> 41:30.795
Joe has a lot of work to do,
if he wants to keep

41:30.797 --> 41:34.132
his employees and guests
out of harm's way.

41:34.134 --> 41:35.333
With the help of a shaman,

41:35.335 --> 41:38.069
the elementals will stop
trapping the dead;

41:38.071 --> 41:40.939
and, with the help of a medium,
the dead can move on,

41:40.941 --> 41:43.508
allowing Joe to run
his restaurant safely

41:43.510 --> 41:45.343
for many years to come.
