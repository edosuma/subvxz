<i> The old people said</i>

01:11.839 --> 01:14.573
<i> that sadness creates</i>
<i> a hole in our hearts...</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:19.244
<i> And that the spirit of</i>
<i> shapishico with fill it.</i>

01:22.849 --> 01:26.552
<i> At first, the spirit</i>
<i> goes unnoticed...</i>

01:26.554 --> 01:28.687
<i> Hiding behind our eyes...</i>

01:28.689 --> 01:30.589
<i> But in the dark...</i>

01:31.458 --> 01:33.826
<i> It grows stronger.</i>

01:35.095 --> 01:39.264
<i> Shapishico.</i>

01:53.813 --> 01:56.315
-Child:
<i> It drives us into madness...</i>

01:56.317 --> 02:00.586
<i> Whispering in our ears</i>
<i>until we sacrifice ourselves...</i>

02:00.588 --> 02:02.855
<i> To set the spirit free.</i>

02:05.793 --> 02:09.360
<i> Shapishico.</i>

02:26.679 --> 02:28.580
-Child:
<i> And it spreads...</i>

02:28.582 --> 02:30.616
<i> Like a sickness.</i>

02:30.750 --> 02:33.519
<i> The old people tell us</i>
<i> these stories...</i>

02:33.521 --> 02:35.521
<i> But they forget...</i>

02:36.356 --> 02:39.758
<i> That these stories are true.</i>

03:33.813 --> 03:36.315
-Hello, sir...
-How is it going, man?

03:36.317 --> 03:37.216
-Michael.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.984
I was here last night and...

03:38.986 --> 03:41.353
I left my cell phone.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.421
-Last night?

03:42.423 --> 03:43.789
-Do you have a...

03:43.791 --> 03:44.856
Lost and found?

03:44.858 --> 03:46.625
-Lost and found?

03:46.627 --> 03:48.260
-Yes.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.262
Yes.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.765
Yes! This one.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.468
-Are you sure?

03:56.970 --> 03:58.270
-Yes!

04:01.709 --> 04:03.709
I have to call my girlfriend...

04:03.711 --> 04:06.979
Otherwise, I'm fucked.
You know what I mean?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.849
Thank you.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.519
You're the best. The best.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.501
-Hi, Hector.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.370
-Hello, Michael.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.539
-You have a very
generous grandmother.

04:34.541 --> 04:38.310
The same type of gift
over and over?

04:38.312 --> 04:39.978
-She has Alzheimer's.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.413
-If you need money...

04:41.415 --> 04:43.782
I could help you find work.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.717
It could be easier than...

04:45.719 --> 04:47.653
Whatever you call this.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.454
-Resourcefulness.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.557
Besides I'm not really
looking for a job.

04:52.825 --> 04:56.295
I'm actually surprised you even
sell cell phones in here.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.697
-Cell phones pay the bills...

04:58.699 --> 05:02.434
Everything else
here is like a hobby.

05:02.802 --> 05:03.969
-Strange hobby.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.038
-I love history.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.839
It's always changing.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.007
New discoveries...

05:09.009 --> 05:10.742
Truth brought to light.

05:10.744 --> 05:16.081
Tomorrow everything
we know about the past
could be different.

05:19.085 --> 05:20.619
-Not everything.

05:20.621 --> 05:21.920
Bye, Hector.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.655
-Good luck.

05:38.439 --> 05:41.973
-Out! Out! Get the hell
out my driveway!

05:41.975 --> 05:42.874
Out!

05:42.876 --> 05:43.775
Out!

05:43.777 --> 05:44.843
Out!

05:45.345 --> 05:46.578
-I'm sorry.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.507
-Michael:
Danny?

06:56.149 --> 06:57.449
Danny.

06:57.850 --> 06:58.183
Danny!

07:09.830 --> 07:10.929
-Fuck!

07:10.931 --> 07:11.930
-Sir...

07:11.932 --> 07:13.765
-Fuck, man!
-I'm sorry!

07:13.767 --> 07:15.200
Sir... I'm so sorry!

07:15.202 --> 07:16.201
-Asshole!
-I'm sorry!

07:16.203 --> 07:17.536
-What? Get out.
-I'm sorry!

07:17.538 --> 07:20.439
-What are you doing in there?
Get out of my car!

07:20.441 --> 07:21.840
You little cunt!
-Sir.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.208
-Fuck!
-Sir...

07:24.812 --> 07:26.978
-What the hell is going on?
Leave him alone!

07:26.980 --> 07:27.712
-Mind your own business!

07:27.714 --> 07:32.050
-When the cops get here,
I'll tell them you
almost killed this guy.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.819
-Get out of here.
-You get out!

07:33.821 --> 07:38.857
-I'm watching you, fucker!
-Get the hell out!

07:39.459 --> 07:41.626
-What a couple of idiots.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.862
-You'll get what you deserve!

07:48.701 --> 07:49.768
-Are you okay?

07:49.770 --> 07:51.203
-I'm okay, I should be fine.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.804
-So what was that all about?

07:52.806 --> 07:55.140
-Well... apparently,
that guy is not a big fan

07:55.142 --> 07:57.509
of people sleeping in
the back seat of his car.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.544
-So you're homeless?

07:59.546 --> 08:01.947
-I prefer the term traveler.

08:01.949 --> 08:05.650
It seems less...

08:05.652 --> 08:06.952
-Pathetic?

08:06.954 --> 08:08.720
-Yeah.

08:08.722 --> 08:08.987
I guess.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.924
I left home with enough
money to last me a year
and I've been gone for two.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.126
-Why haven't you gone home?

08:15.963 --> 08:18.129
I'm not quite ready for that.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.232
Anyway, I'm Michael.

08:20.234 --> 08:21.500
Thanks for...

08:21.502 --> 08:22.834
-No, no it was cool.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.238
Look, medellin has worked
hard to leave its past behind.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.773
We don't need any dead
Americans in the street.

08:28.775 --> 08:31.943
I know some guys who have
a place outside the city...

08:31.945 --> 08:33.945
And they're having
a little party tonight.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.813
You should come,
check it out.

08:35.816 --> 08:40.552
Maybe they might be able to set
you up with a place to stay.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.124
Come by around 10!

09:41.147 --> 09:42.280
-Hello?

09:47.086 --> 09:48.086
Hello?

09:57.598 --> 09:58.830
-Hey!

10:13.713 --> 10:16.147
-I'm looking for melody.

10:21.020 --> 10:24.990
-Come in, come in!

11:10.036 --> 11:12.937
-Hey! You!

11:12.939 --> 11:15.040
Come here.

11:22.815 --> 11:23.948
How are you, my friend?

11:23.950 --> 11:25.784
-I'm Michael.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.688
-Michael?

11:30.189 --> 11:32.090
Do you know any Michael?

11:32.725 --> 11:34.426
Pauly, you know any Michael?

11:34.428 --> 11:35.060
-No!

11:35.062 --> 11:37.262
-Melody invited me.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.163
-Melody?

11:40.400 --> 11:43.234
-Melody?

11:43.236 --> 11:44.803
Nope.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.304
Don't know any melody.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.339
-Pauly:
Nope!

11:49.875 --> 11:52.110
-It's my bad, sorry guys.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.146
-No wait!

11:55.148 --> 11:56.047
Hey!

11:56.049 --> 11:57.115
Hey!

11:57.349 --> 11:58.917
It's all right, okay?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.251
No, stay come on.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.721
See, we are having a party...

12:02.723 --> 12:04.422
And you're here...

12:04.424 --> 12:05.724
So...

12:06.826 --> 12:07.859
Have a seat...

12:07.861 --> 12:09.461
Take a load off.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.198
Sit down!

12:15.901 --> 12:17.035
Sit down!

12:18.270 --> 12:20.271
Where are you from, Michael?

12:23.075 --> 12:24.375
-San Diego.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.010
-San Diego?

12:26.512 --> 12:29.180
You are a long way from home.

12:31.383 --> 12:34.018
Excuse me, I forgot my manners.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.019
You need a drink.

12:35.021 --> 12:38.923
And you, Vinnie,
you've had too much...

12:38.925 --> 12:40.291
As always.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.392
Here.

12:42.895 --> 12:44.129
-I'm good.

12:46.465 --> 12:47.799
-I'm offering you a drink.

12:47.801 --> 12:51.770
It's disrespectful
to turn it down.

13:01.414 --> 13:02.781
-Manuela!

13:06.352 --> 13:07.485
-Michael.

13:10.856 --> 13:12.924
Do you know the sound...

13:13.092 --> 13:15.293
A dead American makes...

13:16.195 --> 13:18.062
In medellin?

13:22.868 --> 13:24.335
You hear it?

13:24.970 --> 13:26.337
That's it.

13:27.873 --> 13:28.973
Nothing.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.176
-Melody:
Jacob!

13:32.945 --> 13:33.511
-Melody!

13:33.513 --> 13:34.112
-Playing nice?

13:34.114 --> 13:36.381
-Oh, my Princess, yes,
yes, we are playing nice.

13:36.383 --> 13:41.519
You know, a little scare,
just makes a boy into a man.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.322
Right, Michael?

13:44.324 --> 13:45.890
-Yeah.

13:46.258 --> 13:48.459
We were just getting
to know each other.

13:48.461 --> 13:48.927
-Yes!

13:48.929 --> 13:53.364
That is right. We are just
getting to know each other.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.599
Nothing more.

13:58.103 --> 14:00.071
To old friends...

14:03.275 --> 14:04.876
And to new.

14:05.911 --> 14:11.216
Welcome to the house
of the dead men.

14:14.286 --> 14:14.853
-This...

14:14.855 --> 14:17.488
This is the start
of a good relationship.

14:18.457 --> 14:19.557
I think.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.392
Manuela!

14:22.027 --> 14:24.195
The music!

15:14.213 --> 15:15.380
-Hello there.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.515
How are you feeling?

15:18.284 --> 15:19.617
-Like shit.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.924
What happened?

15:25.926 --> 15:27.592
-See for yourself.

15:27.594 --> 15:31.162
The night wasn't all bad.

15:32.564 --> 15:33.464
Do you like it?

15:33.466 --> 15:36.434
-Yeah, good picture.

15:36.635 --> 15:39.070
-Hey so, who's Danny?

15:39.438 --> 15:43.641
Yeah, you were saying
his name last night.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.314
-He's my baby brother.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.117
He died.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.188
-I'm sorry.

16:03.095 --> 16:05.263
-Good, you're awake.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.434
Come on, let me show you around.

16:09.601 --> 16:10.735
-I have to go anyway.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.403
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.237
You have fun.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.139
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.975
Behave yourself.

16:17.743 --> 16:19.377
-Always.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.013
She's a good girl.

16:26.251 --> 16:27.485
Come on.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.195
Jacob:
Out here, nobody fucks with us.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.130
We are completely off the grid.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.031
-Michael:
What was this place?

16:40.033 --> 16:43.634
-Jacob:
It was a psychiatric
hospital for women.

16:44.269 --> 16:47.005
Shut down 15 years ago.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.541
-Why did they close it down?

16:50.543 --> 16:54.746
-It has what I guess you
would call a "disturbing past."

17:03.389 --> 17:06.257
Down this hallway,
there was a boy...

17:07.059 --> 17:09.227
Mauricio rojas.

17:09.661 --> 17:10.795
He was born here.

17:10.797 --> 17:14.398
All the children in this
wing were born here.

17:15.134 --> 17:16.768
<i> Mauricio...</i>

17:17.603 --> 17:18.236
<i> Killed himself.</i>

17:18.238 --> 17:23.040
Drove the splintered end
of a headboard
right through his chest.

17:24.542 --> 17:25.810
-Jesus.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.113
-Later that same night,

17:29.115 --> 17:33.117
all the children in this wing
committed suicide.

17:36.488 --> 17:37.488
They slit their wrists

17:37.490 --> 17:40.391
with glass from
a broken lightbulb.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.797
No one knows why.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.101
I think the doctors...

17:50.103 --> 17:51.803
They fucked them up.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.739
They were tired of
living in these cages...

17:54.741 --> 17:58.242
So they got out
on their own terms.

17:59.578 --> 18:02.480
Let's get the fuck out of here.

18:19.465 --> 18:20.765
Welcome home.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.500
-Thanks.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.308
-Michael:
Hello?

19:44.883 --> 19:46.684
-Freedom.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.887
When I look at you,
i don't see freedom.

19:50.455 --> 19:52.456
I see slaves.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.494
Slaves to the past...

19:57.496 --> 19:58.930
To regret.

19:59.665 --> 20:03.968
The only true freedom
lies in death.

20:05.237 --> 20:06.637
And as one of the dead men...

20:06.639 --> 20:11.642
Man: Ready to die!

20:12.811 --> 20:15.313
-I can tell you...

20:15.781 --> 20:17.448
Freedom...

20:17.450 --> 20:18.950
It feels...

20:18.952 --> 20:19.984
Fucking good!

20:24.523 --> 20:25.723
-Michael...

20:26.458 --> 20:28.326
Come up here.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.262
-I'm, I'm good
where I am, thanks.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.231
-No you're not.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.602
You're living in
a fucking bubble...

20:38.003 --> 20:40.871
And it's about time it's popped.

20:41.540 --> 20:42.707
Come on.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.651
-Man:
That's it, there you go.

20:54.786 --> 20:58.689
Michael here,
he needs a place to stay.

20:59.324 --> 21:01.692
But if he wants
to be one of us...

21:01.793 --> 21:04.362
There's one more thing he needs.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.664
One foot in the grave.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.335
But first a toast...

21:13.338 --> 21:15.406
To new beginnings!

21:15.607 --> 21:21.779
Up! Down! Center! Inside!

21:30.922 --> 21:32.823
-And now...

21:33.492 --> 21:35.559
Now a real drink.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.463
-What's that?

21:39.465 --> 21:41.932
-A friend wouldn't ask.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.620
-What the fuck was that?

22:02.622 --> 22:03.754
-Oh. That...

22:03.756 --> 22:06.824
--...was just the beginning.

22:13.899 --> 22:15.933
Let's fucking party!

24:12.017 --> 24:14.618
-Bye, Michael.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.621
Danny?

24:18.590 --> 24:19.824
Danny.

25:13.678 --> 25:14.612
-Hey!

25:14.614 --> 25:15.713
Hey!

25:15.715 --> 25:16.881
Michael!

25:16.883 --> 25:18.148
Hey!

25:18.150 --> 25:19.884
Look at me.

25:20.652 --> 25:22.853
Michael, are you with me?

25:23.822 --> 25:24.922
-Yes?

25:25.524 --> 25:27.091
-You see me?

25:27.093 --> 25:28.025
-Yeah.

25:28.027 --> 25:31.562
There's someone standing
right in front of you.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.297
Look.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.668
Can you see?

25:38.870 --> 25:40.271
Yes?

25:44.709 --> 25:46.544
Michael...

25:47.112 --> 25:49.680
It's someone you hate.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.250
Someone...

25:54.052 --> 25:56.720
You want to see dead.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.057
Hey.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.759
Look.

26:12.170 --> 26:13.804
Do it.

26:30.355 --> 26:32.690
Michael... Michael!

26:33.258 --> 26:35.359
You with me? Yes?

26:37.629 --> 26:39.129
Hush.

26:42.734 --> 26:43.133
Congratulations,

26:43.135 --> 26:47.037
you just took your first step
to becoming a dead man.

27:04.255 --> 27:06.690
-Michael:
So what the hell did
you give me last night?

27:06.692 --> 27:09.259
-Blackstar.
It's similar to yagé.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.996
Various vines and roots
from the jungle.

27:11.998 --> 27:14.965
Tourists call it ayahuasca.

27:14.967 --> 27:18.102
-Wait. You gave me
fucking ayahuasca?

27:18.737 --> 27:21.038
-It helps you open your
mind to the spiritual world

27:21.040 --> 27:23.874
confronting your
personal demons.

27:24.175 --> 27:26.777
Today, it is used in
healing ceremonies.

27:27.345 --> 27:27.978
Shit like that.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.815
Still... a little heads-up
would've been nice.

27:31.916 --> 27:34.284
-What would be
the fun of that?

27:39.091 --> 27:42.326
-Man:
This food is disgusting!
It has hairs on it.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.828
Do me a favor and bring
me a plate of good food.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.897
-Waitress:
Sorry, sir. They'll
make you a new one.

27:46.899 --> 27:49.366
-Of all the places in the world,
why medellin?

27:49.368 --> 27:50.934
-I was born here.

27:50.936 --> 27:51.935
My mom was Colombian.

27:51.937 --> 27:54.171
-I knew there was something
about you I liked.

27:54.173 --> 27:57.708
-She died when I was five.
I don't remember her at all.

27:57.710 --> 28:01.045
My dad was stationed
here when they met and...

28:02.013 --> 28:04.948
He didn't even know
i was born until she died.

28:04.950 --> 28:11.288
After she passed, he came down
and took me up to San Diego.

28:20.098 --> 28:21.765
-Now you're back.

28:23.301 --> 28:26.970
-How about you? You don't sound
like you are from around here.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.038
-No, I was born in this city.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.873
But I spent most of
my time traveling.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.443
Living with shamans
in Chile, Peru...

28:32.445 --> 28:34.344
Studying at ashrams in India.

28:34.346 --> 28:37.081
Learning
the intricacies of life...

28:37.083 --> 28:38.482
And death.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.084
So what made you come back?

28:40.086 --> 28:41.719
<i> "Chimba."</i>

28:41.721 --> 28:42.753
Pussy.

28:45.156 --> 28:46.223
-No.

28:48.259 --> 28:48.892
-Home.
-Yeah.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.862
-It has a way
of calling us back.

28:52.130 --> 28:53.764
Let me ask you a question.

28:53.766 --> 28:57.301
If you knew you had
one year left to live...

28:58.136 --> 29:00.971
How would you live
the rest of your life?

29:01.106 --> 29:04.141
You see, life is just a long,
scenic drive off of a cliff.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.410
Most people try to distract
themselves along the way.

29:06.412 --> 29:11.215
They turn to god or try
to live a meaningful life.

29:11.217 --> 29:12.750
But at the end of the road,

29:12.752 --> 29:14.485
whether you're a good person...

29:14.487 --> 29:15.953
Or a son of a bitch...

29:15.955 --> 29:18.155
It's all the same cliff.

29:18.523 --> 29:20.924
-So just do whatever
the hell we want?

29:20.926 --> 29:21.825
-Exactly.

29:21.827 --> 29:24.194
<i> Shapishico.</i>

29:24.496 --> 29:29.933
-Let me show you some things
your boyfriend can't. Come on!

29:30.301 --> 29:32.436
Why are you playing hard to get?

29:32.438 --> 29:33.103
Huh?

29:33.105 --> 29:37.307
-See, me and the others, we live
as if we are already dead.

29:37.309 --> 29:38.909
A dead man has
no responsibilities.

29:38.911 --> 29:39.810
He does not live
for anyone else.

29:39.812 --> 29:44.081
He doesn't worry of how
he will make a living.

29:45.150 --> 29:47.284
A dead man has no past.

29:48.186 --> 29:50.120
-A dead man has no regrets.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.423
-We do what we want,
when we want...

29:54.025 --> 29:56.026
Fuck everything else.

29:58.496 --> 30:00.798
-Wait right here.

30:14.145 --> 30:15.179
Excuse me, sir.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.181
-Yes?
-Excuse my Spanish.

30:17.183 --> 30:21.451
What is this area called?
-Santo domingo.

30:40.338 --> 30:43.207
-Is being a dead man
something you want?

30:46.477 --> 30:48.212
Let's go.

30:50.982 --> 30:55.118
-Jacob:
Three and a half kilometers
of medellin's finest curves.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.354
Even finer than pauly's mother.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.890
-Michael:
This is insane.

30:59.892 --> 31:01.225
-The things you fear,
they control you.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.427
If you fear death,
then death will control you.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.530
To be one of us,
you must fear nothing.

31:06.532 --> 31:07.598
-Are you scared, Michael?

31:07.600 --> 31:09.600
-I'm not scared.
I just don't want to die.

31:09.602 --> 31:11.401
-"I'm not scared.
I just don't want to die."

31:11.403 --> 31:15.205
I should have brought
my extra large tampons.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.340
-Man:
What for?

31:16.342 --> 31:18.942
-For this giant pussy.

31:20.912 --> 31:22.646
-Live like you're already dead.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.949
Life is the most fun that way.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.554
-Man:
Let's go!

31:51.142 --> 31:53.510
-Check this fucker out!

32:18.202 --> 32:21.538
-Are you scared, Michael?
-What are you doing?

32:22.941 --> 32:24.207
Let me go, fuck.

32:24.209 --> 32:27.144
--Let me go!

32:33.518 --> 32:36.687
Come on.
Let me go!

32:47.031 --> 32:48.398
-Hey you made it!

32:48.400 --> 32:49.333
-I almost died.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.535
-Yeah, that was the point.

32:52.538 --> 32:53.470
-Almost.

32:54.039 --> 32:55.572
-You think this
is a fucking joke?

32:55.574 --> 32:56.740
-Easy guys, easy.

32:56.742 --> 33:00.477
When you were up on that hill,
you were afraid to die.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.412
But you faced it.

33:02.414 --> 33:04.081
And now how do you feel?

33:04.083 --> 33:04.648
Your muscles are tense,

33:04.650 --> 33:09.686
your spine tingles,
your hair is standing on end,
it's electric.

33:12.690 --> 33:14.458
You're the most alive

33:14.460 --> 33:17.194
when you're close to death.

33:19.097 --> 33:21.365
This is how we live.

33:24.168 --> 33:26.636
What do you want, Michael?

33:35.480 --> 33:37.147
-More.

34:17.522 --> 34:20.690
-Man:
<i> People think they</i>
<i> can tell us how to live.</i>

34:20.692 --> 34:22.659
<i> They think because</i>
<i> they're older,</i>

34:22.661 --> 34:24.460
<i> they have all of the answers.</i>

34:24.463 --> 34:26.763
But you know what?

34:27.665 --> 34:29.331
That's not true.

34:29.333 --> 34:32.335
You want to know why
i became a dead man?

34:32.337 --> 34:36.505
<i> Because all we know is</i>
<i> that we are here today...</i>

34:36.507 --> 34:38.074
<i> And that's all that matters.</i>

34:38.077 --> 34:40.677
Old people, they get stuck
thinking about the past.

34:40.679 --> 34:46.083
They tell us to understand
what we do today is
important tomorrow.

34:46.085 --> 34:49.319
But guess what?
It's not, at all.

34:49.321 --> 34:52.856
<i> What matters is right here,</i>
<i> right now.</i>

34:52.858 --> 34:55.292
<i> The past is gone.</i>

35:10.108 --> 35:12.142
-Michael:
Danny?

35:13.445 --> 35:15.879
-Man:
Are you all right?

35:24.755 --> 35:27.157
-You're just seeing things...

35:27.159 --> 35:29.593
Just seeing things.

35:30.194 --> 35:33.396
-Dude, we're gonna
have the best gear.

35:33.398 --> 35:39.336
I'm gonna cash in some
favors so we'll get the works.
Full sound package.

35:39.338 --> 35:44.908
-I'm going to make sure we have
a river of pharmaceuticals...

35:44.910 --> 35:47.310
And narcotics
running through this place.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.880
Weed, weed, weed,
tons of weed.

35:49.882 --> 35:53.183
-Get it together,
Michael, come on.

35:59.457 --> 36:02.893
-Ketamine. Ghb.

36:03.628 --> 36:05.462
-And blackstar.

36:05.863 --> 36:06.830
-Blackstar?

36:06.832 --> 36:09.733
-I want everybody on it.

36:10.935 --> 36:14.571
-No, no, not if you want it...

36:15.173 --> 36:17.307
I'll get it for you.

36:18.242 --> 36:22.212
This is going to be
our biggest party yet.

36:25.216 --> 36:26.550
-It's just in your head.

36:26.552 --> 36:29.252
You're just seeing things.

36:35.393 --> 36:36.293
-Michael.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.461
What are you seeing?

36:39.263 --> 36:41.264
-Nothing man.
I'm, I'm...

36:41.266 --> 36:42.232
I'm good.

36:42.234 --> 36:43.366
-Oh really?

36:43.368 --> 36:45.368
-Yeah, I'm okay.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.470
Let's go.

37:48.767 --> 37:52.969
<i> Shapishico.</i>

37:59.511 --> 38:00.577
No!

38:01.846 --> 38:03.446
Help!

38:03.714 --> 38:05.749
--Michael! Hey!

38:05.751 --> 38:07.350
Hey! Michael!

38:07.352 --> 38:08.985
Hey! Hey! Stop!

38:09.754 --> 38:10.020
Relax.

38:10.022 --> 38:11.554
Hey! Relax!
-What's going on?

38:11.556 --> 38:13.590
-Just night terrors,
i get them sometimes too.

38:13.592 --> 38:17.427
Just relax.
You're fine, you're fine.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.965
You should get that cleaned up.

38:37.948 --> 38:41.084
-Doesn't this place
kind of freak you out?

38:41.852 --> 38:44.087
-Oh, are you scared?

38:44.089 --> 38:45.021
-What?

38:45.023 --> 38:46.356
You're not at all?

38:46.358 --> 38:47.691
-I'm ready for anything.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.626
Come on, let's race.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.861
-All right.
-On three.

38:51.863 --> 38:52.962
Three!

38:54.732 --> 38:55.565
-Cheater!

38:56.535 --> 38:57.534
-Loser!

38:57.536 --> 38:58.868
-I'm stuck!

38:58.870 --> 39:00.370
There.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.702
Melody?

39:38.008 --> 39:39.576
Melody.

40:00.798 --> 40:02.065
Melody.

40:05.936 --> 40:08.872
-Oh my god...
It's not funny.

40:08.874 --> 40:10.440
-I really got you, didn't I?

40:10.442 --> 40:12.942
-Yeah, you scared
the living shit out of me.

40:12.944 --> 40:15.078
-That was the idea.

40:16.714 --> 40:18.915
-Where did you get that?

40:18.917 --> 40:21.451
-Come on. Come on,
I'll show you.

40:21.453 --> 40:23.019
Come on.

40:31.562 --> 40:32.829
Right here.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.831
Check this out.

40:41.105 --> 40:44.641
-It's one of the kids
who killed himself.

40:44.643 --> 40:49.712
-I guess there's no reason
to move their files
if they're dead, right?

40:50.114 --> 40:52.081
-Yeah, I guess.

41:03.761 --> 41:06.729
-Melody:
Come on jump, let's go.

41:08.132 --> 41:08.665
Let's go!

41:08.667 --> 41:09.732
-Are you sure about this?
-Yeah!

41:09.734 --> 41:12.869
I've done this a million
times. Trust me.

41:15.973 --> 41:20.210
See? It wasn't hard. Come on.

41:27.952 --> 41:28.685
Come on, Michael.

41:28.687 --> 41:31.821
-Really? Are you going
to splash me right now?

41:33.257 --> 41:34.958
Are you serious?

41:35.860 --> 41:37.961
You're in so much trouble.
-Oh really?

41:37.963 --> 41:40.029
-You're in so much trouble.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.255
-You're just seeing things.
You're just seeing things.

42:18.102 --> 42:21.638
-Where are you going?
What, what's wrong?

42:21.640 --> 42:23.206
Michael!

42:29.980 --> 42:31.080
Michael!

42:32.116 --> 42:34.150
What's wrong?

42:40.024 --> 42:42.125
-My little brother Danny...

42:42.226 --> 42:43.326
I saw him in the water.

42:43.328 --> 42:45.228
-There's nobody there.

42:46.564 --> 42:47.964
You're fine.

42:49.033 --> 42:50.667
-I've been seeing things.

42:50.669 --> 42:53.903
Since that first time
at the hospital, something
is wrong with me.

42:53.905 --> 42:57.307
I used to have
nightmares, but this is...

42:58.342 --> 42:59.208
This is worse.

42:59.210 --> 43:03.813
It's like I feel him with...
With me everywhere I go.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.816
-It must be the stuff you drank.

43:06.818 --> 43:08.952
It's not real.

43:15.626 --> 43:18.227
-It's my fault Danny died.

43:19.363 --> 43:23.266
It's my fault that he's gone.

43:34.211 --> 43:37.046
-You loved him, right?

43:39.750 --> 43:40.917
-Of course.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.785
-Then I'm sure he knew that

43:42.787 --> 43:45.355
and he would have forgiven you.

43:56.034 --> 44:00.370
-Doctor: <i> Mauricio, take off</i>
<i>the mask while we're together.</i>
<i> -No.</i>

44:00.372 --> 44:02.038
<i> -Take it off, nothing</i>
<i> will happen to you.</i>

44:02.040 --> 44:05.074
<i> -No, I'm not taking</i>
<i> off the mask.</i>

44:07.277 --> 44:08.745
<i> -Are you still</i>
<i> having nightmares?</i>

44:08.747 --> 44:13.650
<i> -They're not nightmares if</i>
<i> I have them when I'm awake.</i>

44:14.652 --> 44:16.252
<i> Shapishico.</i>

44:16.254 --> 44:20.256
<i> -Shapishico is just a story,</i>
<i> it's not real. Relax. Look...</i>

44:20.258 --> 44:25.128
-Nurse:
<i> Excuse me, doctor.</i>
<i> It's time for his medicine.</i>

44:25.863 --> 44:30.700
<i> -Let's just do this.</i>
<i> Take it off while we're</i>
<i> here, just the two of us.</i>

44:30.702 --> 44:31.034
<i> -No!</i>

44:31.036 --> 44:32.268
<i>-Mauricio take your medicine.</i>

44:32.270 --> 44:35.171
<i>-I'm not taking off the mask.</i>
<i> -It will be okay.</i>

44:35.173 --> 44:36.239
<i> -No! I don't want to.</i>

44:36.241 --> 44:39.809
<i> -You have to take it.</i>
<i>It will help you, don't worry.</i>

44:39.811 --> 44:42.278
<i> -It makes things worse.</i>

44:43.747 --> 44:44.047
<i> No!</i>

44:44.049 --> 44:46.382
<i> I'm not going to take it!</i>

44:46.384 --> 44:47.250
<i> -Relax.</i>

44:47.252 --> 44:49.218
<i> You see? Nothing happened.</i>

44:49.220 --> 44:51.087
<i> It's ok.</i>

44:52.189 --> 44:53.322
<i> -No, shapishico.</i>

44:53.324 --> 44:58.861
<i> -Shapishico is just</i>
<i> a story, it's not real.</i>

44:59.363 --> 45:02.365
<i> Shapishico.</i>

45:02.367 --> 45:04.067
<i> Shapishico.</i>

45:05.135 --> 45:06.235
<i> -No.</i>

45:07.037 --> 45:08.237
<i> -No.</i>

45:12.843 --> 45:15.978
<i> Shapishico.</i>

45:15.980 --> 45:17.113
-Are you lost?

45:17.115 --> 45:19.415
-Nope, I'm just looking around.

45:21.018 --> 45:23.252
-Jacob might want you here.

45:23.754 --> 45:25.288
But the rest of us don't.

45:25.290 --> 45:28.057
-Really?
-Yes.

45:28.859 --> 45:30.460
Be careful.

45:30.728 --> 45:33.129
Best to leave the dead alone.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.767
-Doctor:
<i> You don't think</i>
<i> I understand you?</i>

45:37.769 --> 45:40.403
-Nurse:
<i> Excuse me, doctor.</i>
<i> It's time for his medicine.</i>

45:40.405 --> 45:44.073
<i> -I'm not taking the medicine.</i>
<i> -Mauricio, don't</i>
<i> worry, it's nothing...</i>

45:44.075 --> 45:47.477
<i> -No, I'm not taking it off.</i>
<i> -Relax.</i>

45:57.354 --> 45:59.455
-You should stick
to cell phones.

45:59.457 --> 46:01.524
Homemade masks
are not a big seller.

46:01.526 --> 46:06.028
-I don't want to sell it.
There's something
written in the back of it.

46:06.030 --> 46:11.400
-It's an inscription
to ward off evil spirits.

46:11.402 --> 46:15.505
The kids do it with
things like the boogeyman.

46:15.507 --> 46:19.509
But "shapishico,"
that's interesting.

46:19.511 --> 46:21.344
-Why? What is "shapishico"?

46:21.346 --> 46:24.847
-It's a part
of the folklore here.

46:24.849 --> 46:27.116
It's a kind of ancient evil.

46:27.118 --> 46:32.188
It's a spirit that would
infect the bodies of men...

46:32.190 --> 46:36.793
Latching to their
own suffering until
it destroys them.

46:36.795 --> 46:43.466
Some ancient tribes used yagé
as a conduit between
shapishico and the child,

46:43.468 --> 46:48.337
believing that it
would grow inside of him.

46:48.339 --> 46:50.339
Until when the spirit
was strong enough...

46:50.341 --> 46:55.278
They held a ceremony
with the rest of the tribe
where they drank yagé...

46:55.280 --> 47:01.551
And the infected
would sacrifice himself
releasing the spirit.

47:01.553 --> 47:06.589
Self-sacrifices are essential
for the ritual.

47:06.591 --> 47:10.293
-So this guy would kill himself,
infecting everybody, why?

47:10.295 --> 47:11.494
-It's only purpose is to spread.

47:11.496 --> 47:17.600
It drives you into madness
to the point where one takes
his own life.

47:17.602 --> 47:20.369
-Do people still
believe this stuff?

47:21.071 --> 47:24.073
-Spirits, demons, monsters...

47:24.075 --> 47:29.011
They are just words
we created for what
we don't understand.

47:29.013 --> 47:32.582
But beneath the superstition,
there is truth.

47:32.584 --> 47:34.617
-Do you think I can borrow this?

47:34.619 --> 47:37.086
-Just be careful with it.

47:37.088 --> 47:39.889
There are not many of those.

47:39.891 --> 47:42.058
-I'll take care of it.

47:42.060 --> 47:44.026
Thanks, Hector.

47:45.028 --> 47:46.529
Take care.

47:56.974 --> 47:58.507
-Hey.

47:59.576 --> 48:01.444
-Melody tells me
she's worried about you.

48:01.446 --> 48:07.550
She says, you've been
seeing things, something
about your brother?

48:08.218 --> 48:10.186
You know, I've been there.

48:10.454 --> 48:13.256
I've seen the things
that you are seeing.

48:14.992 --> 48:16.626
-What are you talking about?

48:16.628 --> 48:17.894
-We all have.

48:17.896 --> 48:21.163
It's part of being one of us.

48:21.665 --> 48:27.970
Your eyes are open for the first
time and the light is blinding.

48:28.272 --> 48:30.907
-Why didn't you tell me
all this before?

48:30.909 --> 48:31.207
-I did.

48:31.209 --> 48:35.611
I told you the yagé
would open your mind
to the spiritual world...

48:36.013 --> 48:39.148
To help you confront
your demons...

48:39.150 --> 48:41.183
To embrace them.

48:42.653 --> 48:44.086
-How do I make it stop?

48:44.088 --> 48:48.291
-When you understand
that nothing matters,

48:48.293 --> 48:51.127
not life, not death,

48:51.129 --> 48:53.462
then you will be ready.

48:54.097 --> 48:56.365
-I'm ready now.

48:58.602 --> 49:01.637
-Jacob:
This road was once part

49:01.639 --> 49:03.239
of the aburrá trail.

49:03.241 --> 49:08.644
They believed that
this trail would lead
to the top of the world.

49:10.580 --> 49:12.648
And as a rite of passage...

49:12.650 --> 49:14.150
A boy...

49:14.152 --> 49:17.353
Would out go into the night...

49:18.455 --> 49:20.523
Find the trail...

49:21.992 --> 49:25.695
To face the darkness alone.

49:26.296 --> 49:27.496
When the spaniards came...

49:27.498 --> 49:30.666
The aburrá people,
they were overrun...

49:30.668 --> 49:33.269
But instead of surrendering,

49:33.271 --> 49:35.471
the warriors, they marched

49:35.473 --> 49:37.573
to the top of the trail

49:37.575 --> 49:39.375
and they hung themselves.

49:39.377 --> 49:42.478
For they believed it was better

49:43.080 --> 49:45.214
to die free...

49:46.016 --> 49:47.116
Than to live as a slave.

49:47.118 --> 49:52.421
And to this day, their sacrifice
for freedom is honored.

49:53.390 --> 49:54.657
Hundreds...

49:54.659 --> 49:57.259
Gather each year...

49:58.628 --> 50:01.230
To ride this trail.

50:02.766 --> 50:06.569
-That's why you brought me here?
To climb a trail?

50:14.745 --> 50:16.579
-Shit!

50:18.115 --> 50:21.384
-You want to see
a stampede, Michael?

50:21.386 --> 50:23.085
It's a pure animal instinct,

50:23.087 --> 50:25.488
a group of individuals with
a singular mind. It's chaos!

50:25.490 --> 50:31.027
You put a man
in front of a stampede,
his first instinct is to run.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.130
-We don't run.

50:34.132 --> 50:38.667
You stay on the road
until it's over.

50:39.102 --> 50:41.437
-Until what's over?

50:42.739 --> 50:44.407
-The stampede.

50:51.181 --> 50:53.182
Remember,
you're already dead.

51:37.561 --> 51:40.729
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, right there.

51:42.699 --> 51:44.200
-Yo bitch!

51:44.202 --> 51:46.135
What the fuck are you doing?

51:46.137 --> 51:46.569
-What?

51:46.571 --> 51:49.105
-Are you fucking crazy?
You're tagging over mine.

51:49.107 --> 51:51.173
-What? That faded thing,
you can't claim that.

51:51.175 --> 51:53.309
-Don't touch her!
-Michael. No, it's okay.

51:53.311 --> 51:58.380
-What's up, gringo?
Are you a tough guy?

51:58.382 --> 52:00.616
-Shh! Shh! Shh!

52:00.618 --> 52:03.652
-Your tag... was shit.

52:03.820 --> 52:06.822
-You must have inked
it with your pussy.

52:06.824 --> 52:08.858
-It was actually
your girlfriend's pussy.

52:08.860 --> 52:12.328
This doesn't concern you.
It's none of your business.

52:12.330 --> 52:15.164
I really don't want
a beef with you.

52:15.166 --> 52:16.866
-It is my business now.

52:27.477 --> 52:30.513
-What's up, you son of a bitch!
Back off!

52:30.515 --> 52:34.650
You too, motherfuckers.
What's up?

52:36.786 --> 52:39.822
-Cute knife, faggot.

52:40.858 --> 52:43.325
Get down on the ground.

52:44.194 --> 52:45.828
On the ground!

52:59.709 --> 53:01.944
-Don't think.

53:01.946 --> 53:04.180
Just do it.

53:04.182 --> 53:05.748
-Do it. Do it.

53:05.750 --> 53:07.783
Finish it. Finish it.

53:07.785 --> 53:10.786
Finish it. Finish it.

53:23.466 --> 53:26.302
-Come on! Come on!

53:34.211 --> 53:37.580
-Who's the tough guy now, huh?

53:52.596 --> 53:54.230
-Welcome to the dead men.

54:38.441 --> 54:39.975
-Remember this feeling.

54:39.977 --> 54:44.613
It will be with you
until the day you die.

54:44.881 --> 54:48.617
Tomorrow night,
at our party,

54:48.619 --> 54:51.420
we're celebrating in your honor.

54:54.491 --> 54:58.427
To Michael!

55:03.433 --> 55:05.401
-What is all this?

55:05.403 --> 55:07.703
-We're celebrating.

55:07.705 --> 55:09.405
-What?

55:11.341 --> 55:13.575
I'm a dead man now.

55:18.014 --> 55:19.815
Come on, I need to talk to you.

55:19.817 --> 55:21.617
-Are you serious, right now?

55:21.619 --> 55:23.886
-Yes, come on.

55:30.060 --> 55:31.727
-I thought you wanted this.

55:31.729 --> 55:32.594
You brought me here.

55:32.596 --> 55:34.596
-I didn't bring you here
to be one of them.

55:34.598 --> 55:37.966
I brought you here
because you didn't have
anywhere else to go.

55:37.968 --> 55:40.536
Look, I really
wanted to help you.

55:40.538 --> 55:42.871
-I don't need your help.

55:45.075 --> 55:48.377
-Melody:
You know, Jacob doesn't have
all the answers.

55:48.379 --> 55:51.880
You don't have to be him.
-This isn't about Jacob.

55:51.882 --> 55:54.516
-This is about me.

55:54.984 --> 55:57.553
And I'm feeling fucking great.

55:59.422 --> 56:01.357
And if you cared about me...

56:01.359 --> 56:04.393
You'd be happy for me.

56:06.496 --> 56:06.962
You know what?

56:06.964 --> 56:09.998
I'm done caring
about insignificant shit.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.501
-So I'm insignificant?

56:12.503 --> 56:14.436
Fuck you!

56:14.438 --> 56:15.537
-Hey!

56:15.672 --> 56:17.673
-You're hurting me.
-Good.

56:18.375 --> 56:21.009
-You know, some tattoo
doesn't change who you are.

56:21.011 --> 56:24.580
You think being like them
makes you stronger, you're weak.

56:24.582 --> 56:28.617
A scared little boy running
away from his problems.

56:28.619 --> 56:31.653
I thought you were
better than this.

56:44.968 --> 56:47.703
-Men. Am I right?

56:48.872 --> 56:49.972
-Melody!

56:57.447 --> 56:58.881
Melody?

57:16.766 --> 57:18.033
Danny...

57:19.569 --> 57:20.803
Danny?

57:23.873 --> 57:25.641
Danny?

57:35.218 --> 57:36.585
Danny.

57:42.592 --> 57:43.892
Danny...

57:55.104 --> 57:56.538
Danny.

59:04.107 --> 59:08.777
-Vince! Vince! Get an ambulance!

59:11.581 --> 59:13.782
What happened?

59:16.753 --> 59:17.619
Vince!

59:17.621 --> 59:23.659
Vince! Answer me!
Answer me, please!

59:36.706 --> 59:38.941
-Mauricio:
<i> Shapishico.</i>

59:49.886 --> 59:54.957
-Hector:
<i> Self-sacrifices are essential</i>
<i> for the ritual.</i>

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:15.210
-Hector, I need you.
Hector, I need you!

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:16.144
-What happened?
What happened?

01:00:16.146 --> 01:00:18.780
-I took the yagé...
I've been having nightmares,
only while I'm awake.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:22.184
I don't know,
i don't know what to do.
I need your help, okay?

01:00:22.186 --> 01:00:24.286
-What are you talking about?

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:25.320
Sit down, sit down.

01:00:25.322 --> 01:00:26.989
-My friend Vince
slit his wrists.

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:30.158
We were seeing the same things
you showed us with that book.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.828
If I don't do something,
the same thing is going
to happen to me.

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:37.633
-If this has something
to do with yagé, you
need to talk to you taita.

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:38.800
-With what?

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:39.201
-Your taita.

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:41.069
A shaman. Who was leading
your ceremony?

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:44.039
-Nobody was. They just gave me
that shit and I took it.

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:47.142
-Yagé is not some street drug.

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:49.011
It's a doorway
to a spiritual life.

01:00:49.013 --> 01:00:53.115
And without a taita,
you have left that door open.

01:00:53.117 --> 01:00:55.651
Whoever gave you the yagé

01:00:55.653 --> 01:00:58.020
would have known that.

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:08.196
-It was those, these guys
that I've been staying with
at this abandoned hospital.

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:17.172
-I know someone who can help.

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:36.024
-Taita:
<i>Many claim to understand yagé,</i>

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:39.261
<i> but they are liars</i>
<i> and manipulators.</i>

01:01:39.263 --> 01:01:41.963
What you're seeing
is not your brother.

01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:49.037
There is a very dark force
inside you, using your feelings
against you.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:51.073
-Shapishico.

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:57.913
-Taita:
<i>The tribes of shapishico died</i>
<i>off, but the spirit remained.</i>

01:01:57.915 --> 01:02:03.118
<i> Their killings,</i>
<i>their sacrifices and rituals--</i>

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:09.357
<i> the hospital lives</i>
<i> at the heart of where</i>
<i> all this took place.</i>

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:29.344
<i> That evil is responsible</i>
<i> for what happened</i>
<i> to the children there.</i>

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:34.216
They wanted
to resurrect the spirit...

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:38.920
To create a new
generation of followers.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:42.491
-But they all died, right?

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:45.894
-Not all of them.

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:00.976
-We are closing now for today.

01:03:00.978 --> 01:03:03.512
-We are closing out today.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:09.184
-It's okay, I'm just
returning this for a friend.

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:12.454
-Taita:
Shapishico demands a sacrifice.

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:19.127
But using yagé
with proper intentions will give
you the chance to confront it.

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:22.264
We must begin now.

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:28.136
This will help you
control your anxiety.

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:48.256
-You know I heard about Vince.

01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:50.258
I'm so sorry.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:52.294
I don't know what to say.

01:03:52.296 --> 01:03:55.096
-There's nothing to say.

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:58.200
Death is just part
of who we are.

01:03:58.202 --> 01:04:00.836
We must know to accept it.

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:05.841
-Taita:
The spirit is strong
within you.

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:07.409
You are the ideal sacrifice.

01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:14.282
For centuries shapishico
has claimed many lives.

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:18.587
You must confront it.

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.557
Let it settle with you.

01:04:23.392 --> 01:04:25.126
And concentrate.

01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:27.495
Turn your thoughts within.

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:30.131
Within, you will find the truth.

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:34.135
And with that truth,
you can fight the evil.

01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:41.509
-Melody:
<i> Do you know where Michael is?</i>

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:44.045
I need to talk to him.

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:48.984
-Or you can talk
to him tonight...

01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:51.219
At the party.

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:58.994
-You know I can't believe
you're still having the party.

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:03.298
-It's what Vince
would've wanted.

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:57.252
-Come on, Danny. I've done this
a million times, you'll be fine.

01:05:57.254 --> 01:05:59.654
-I'm scared.
-I'm not going down with you!

01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:03.458
Either you jump
or you go down by yourself.

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:05.627
Jump!

01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:06.594
-No!

01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:08.163
-Come on!

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:14.002
-No!

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:15.971
-Jump!

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:23.178
-Danny! Danny!

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:44.532
-Taita:
<i> There is a very dark</i>
<i> force inside you.</i>

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:04.152
-Hector:
<i> It's a spirit that would</i>
<i> infect the bodies of men...</i>

01:07:04.154 --> 01:07:09.691
<i> Latching to their</i>
<i> own suffering until</i>
<i> it destroyed them.</i>

01:07:12.294 --> 01:07:15.797
-Taita:
<i> What you are seeing</i>
<i> is not your brother.</i>

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.467
-You're not Danny.

01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:21.669
You're not my brother.

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:27.542
You're not Danny.

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.577
You're not my brother!

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:31.046
You're not Danny!

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:32.380
You're not my brother!

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:35.150
You're not my brother!

01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:38.086
You're not my brother!

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:45.160
-Shapishico was in me
when I pushed Danny.

01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:50.331
-No, wait. The force is more
powerful than I imagined.

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:56.805
Don't go! We must
finish the ritual!

01:07:56.807 --> 01:07:57.705
Wait!

01:07:57.707 --> 01:07:59.407
It's in me.

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:54.662
-Hector?

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:01.502
What?

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:06.808
-Hector?

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:11.912
Hector!

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:15.316
Hector...

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:18.386
No... Hector.

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:40.774
-Jacob.

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:02.890
-Michael!

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:17.639
-Michael:
Melody, where are you?

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:46.934
-Jacob:
<i> All the children in</i>
<i> this wing were born here.</i>

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:51.339
I think the doctors,
they fucked them up.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.641
<i> -It makes everything worse.</i>

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:56.678
-Everyone died?
-Not everyone.

01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:01.582
-So they got out
on their own terms.

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:06.054
Your eyes are open for the first
time and the light is blinding.

01:12:06.955 --> 01:12:11.059
<i> Home. It has a way</i>
<i> of calling us back.</i>

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.361
-You're living in
a fucking bubble...

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:16.064
And it's about
time it is popped.

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:21.369
<i> -Michael, come with me.</i>

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:27.942
-Welcome home.

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.986
-Danny:
<i> Goodbye, Michael.</i>

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:41.055
-Michael, Michael...

01:12:41.057 --> 01:12:43.424
What's wrong with you.

01:12:43.426 --> 01:12:45.059
Are you okay?

01:12:47.429 --> 01:12:47.995
-All this time...

01:12:47.997 --> 01:12:51.866
All this time all these things
I've been seeing, they're not...

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:54.802
They're not hallucinations.

01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:57.839
They're memories.

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:02.510
I was born here...

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:07.915
In this hospital.

01:13:07.917 --> 01:13:11.152
-What are you talking
about, Michael?

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:17.091
-Jacob was too.

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:19.460
We were raised here.

01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:25.466
-Michael, you're scaring me.
What's going on with you?

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:35.810
-Michael:
<i>The doctors, they gave us yagé.</i>

01:13:35.812 --> 01:13:37.712
<i> They must have.</i>

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:39.847
<i> We are both infected.</i>

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.552
-Goodbye, Michael.

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:48.856
-It's Jacob.
He killed my friend Hector,
we have to leave right now.

01:13:48.858 --> 01:13:51.659
-No, wait a minute.
I'm not going with you.

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:54.762
-Melody, you have to trust me.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:55.830
I promise I'll tell
you everything,

01:13:55.832 --> 01:14:00.701
but right now we don't have
time, we have to leave now.

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:12.180
-These doors are never locked.

01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:13.781
-It's the ritual.

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:16.184
Come on!

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:42.043
-Michael!

01:14:42.045 --> 01:14:43.578
Michael!

01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:45.880
Michael!
-Melody!

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:50.518
-Michael! Michael!
-Melody!

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.186
Melody!

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.822
-Melody:
Let go!

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:02.730
-Melody!

01:15:02.732 --> 01:15:04.031
-Welcome home, Michael.

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:06.601
It's glad to have you back.

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:13.241
-Let me go!

01:15:13.243 --> 01:15:15.643
-Back off! Back off!

01:15:15.645 --> 01:15:18.713
I'll let her go,
I'll let her go.

01:15:18.715 --> 01:15:19.914
Okay?

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:21.849
-Fuck you!

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.251
-Shut up.

01:15:23.253 --> 01:15:28.155
See, melody, I need you...
Because Michael has
to do something for me,

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:32.660
and I don't think
he is going to go through
with it unless I have this.

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:36.264
-I know what you're doing.

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.065
I know why I'm here.

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:40.268
I remember everything.

01:15:41.971 --> 01:15:46.173
-You have no idea how badly
I've been wanting to tell you.

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:50.778
It's truly been killing me.

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.981
-What happened to us...

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:56.317
What they did to us...

01:15:57.185 --> 01:15:58.853
Was wrong.

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:00.221
-No.

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:01.789
It was a gift.

01:16:01.791 --> 01:16:04.926
You hid from it, I embraced it.

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:10.064
It's always been there, Michael,
hiding... behind your eyes.

01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:12.066
We're the same.

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:15.336
-I'm not a killer.

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:16.304
-Really?

01:16:16.306 --> 01:16:18.639
And what would your
brother say about that?

01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:22.176
I want to ask you something
Michael, did he scream?

01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:24.912
Did you watch
him tumble, Michael?

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:26.314
Did that feel powerful?

01:16:26.316 --> 01:16:28.015
You felt the strength, Michael.

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:29.951
You felt the strength
of generations.

01:16:29.953 --> 01:16:32.987
Mauricio's sacrifice was
the start a new generation.

01:16:32.989 --> 01:16:34.155
We survived
because we were strong,

01:16:34.157 --> 01:16:37.925
and it's greater in us than it
has been in anyone before.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:40.861
We have a chance
to finish what he started!

01:16:40.863 --> 01:16:42.129
-Nobody else has to die.

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:44.065
-We all have to die.
-Jacob, please.

01:16:44.067 --> 01:16:48.803
-Everyone dies!
Back off. Do you
want me to cut her?

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:52.073
You see, Michael?

01:16:52.075 --> 01:16:58.679
Tonight everyone down there
has blackstar running
through their veins.

01:16:58.681 --> 01:17:00.681
It's a yagé derivative,

01:17:00.683 --> 01:17:04.285
an ancient drug with
21st century distribution.

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:13.828
-Everything you've been
through has been leading
you to this moment.

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:16.831
-I've been preparing you.

01:17:18.834 --> 01:17:20.167
Ready to die?

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:24.672
-It can stop here.

01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:26.140
You don't have to do this.
-No.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:30.277
See, it has to be one of us,
and I'd prefer it if it was you.

01:17:31.214 --> 01:17:35.349
-I think if you came here
for little melody,
then perhaps...

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:38.419
You'll die for her.

01:17:39.422 --> 01:17:42.223
So I want you
to jump off the roof.

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:45.326
Sacrifice yourself.

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:48.863
You can die
just like your brother.

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:51.399
-Melody:
No, no, no...

01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:53.668
-Jacob:
Shh!

01:17:59.307 --> 01:18:00.908
Yeah?

01:18:32.941 --> 01:18:34.442
-Jacob:
Come here.

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:39.046
This is why you're here.

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:43.184
Huh? Come on.

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:10.871
-Let's go.

01:20:49.211 --> 01:20:51.412
-Who's the tough guy now?

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:30.217
-You're going to be fine,
okay, Michael?

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:31.185
Hang on, okay?

01:21:31.187 --> 01:21:33.087
I'm taking you to
the hospital, okay?

01:21:33.089 --> 01:21:35.890
Then we can go wherever
you want, Michael.

01:21:35.892 --> 01:21:37.391
Please stay with me.

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:47.268
-Just hang on with me, Michael.

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:48.369
Can you hear me?

01:21:48.371 --> 01:21:49.637
<i> Listen to me.</i>

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:55.209
-Where do you
want to go, Michael?

01:21:55.211 --> 01:21:57.311
Where do you want to go?

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:03.484
-Home.

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:12.960
-Child:
<i> The old people said</i>

01:22:12.962 --> 01:22:16.530
<i> that sadness creates</i>
<i> a hole in our hearts...</i>

01:22:19.167 --> 01:22:23.604
<i> And that the spirit</i>
<i> of shapishico will fill it.</i>

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:49.630
<i> It drives us into madness...</i>

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:53.467
<i> Whispering in our ears</i>
<i>until we sacrifice ourselves...</i>

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:56.003
<i> To set the spirit free.</i>

01:22:56.237 --> 01:22:58.739
- Ready to die.

01:23:01.377 --> 01:23:06.046
-Child:
<i>And it spreads like a sickness.</i>
