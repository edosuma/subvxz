00:21.055 --> 00:23.170
Besides, you have an art
studio right out there.

00:23.204 --> 00:24.948
It's freezing out there.

00:24.971 --> 00:27.017
Maybe Santa will bring me a space heater.

It's peanut brittle time.

00:34.614 --> 00:36.723
You know you can buy them shelled.

00:36.723 --> 00:38.819
No, no, no. They have to be fresh.

little big at Christmas,

00:46.567 --> 00:48.991
but it's the first time since
we've known Daphne and Regina

00:48.991 --> 00:51.162
that they're staying with
us for the holidays, so.

00:51.162 --> 00:52.747
Yeah, usually they're smart enough

00:52.751 --> 00:54.601

but it's Christmas. I want
to be with the Kennishes too.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.444
I like the way we do Christmas...

01:15.480 --> 01:17.100
wake up late, open gifts,

01:17.325 --> 01:20.520
sneak Chinese food into
an empty movie theater.

01:20.557 --> 01:23.026
Just promise you'll be nice at dinner.

01:23.630 --> 01:25.866
- Where are we going?
- Sal's.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.618
Sal's with the garlic knots?

01:27.738 --> 01:28.991
I thought that place closed down.

01:29.036 --> 01:30.308
They just reopened.

01:30.428 --> 01:31.986
It's a Christmas miracle!

John reads "The Night Before Christmas"

01:51.802 --> 01:54.830
- and then we open presents.
- Presents on Christmas Eve?

01:54.850 --> 01:56.785
Just one. The rest in the morning.

01:56.819 --> 01:58.260
We start at 8:00.

01:59.055 --> 02:00.217
A.M.?

02:00.337 --> 02:01.923
Sounds great. Right, mom?

02:02.248 --> 02:05.851
After we open the presents, around 11:00...

02:05.860 --> 02:08.376
It takes three hours to open presents?

much emphasis on gifts.

02:11.138 --> 02:12.455

02:12.921 --> 02:14.998
Still got your picture on the
wall 'round here somewhere.

02:15.016 --> 02:17.495
Hey, Sal. So glad you reopened, buddy!

02:17.522 --> 02:19.580
How's everything? Can
I get you anything else?

02:19.609 --> 02:22.022
All: More garlic knots!

02:22.068 --> 02:24.738
Those things are magic. I can't get enough.

02:26.138 --> 02:28.653
Daphne and I have a few
traditions of our own.

02:28.653 --> 02:31.716
We like to go to a movie on Christmas,
sneak in some Chinese take-out.

02:31.726 --> 02:33.930
Now that sounds like fun. I'm in!

02:34.131 --> 02:37.400
Wait. That's when we do Kennish karaoke.

02:37.434 --> 02:39.244
<i>You know, in the afternoon.</i>

02:39.271 --> 02:41.960
Maybe we could do a movie on the 26th.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.240
Daphne can't really do karaoke...

02:44.274 --> 02:46.058
It's okay. I don't mind.

02:46.067 --> 02:48.600
... And I hate to sing,
so I think maybe we're out.

02:49.771 --> 02:52.588
Mom, it's okay to shake
things up a little bit.

02:52.588 --> 02:54.164
I don't think it's too much to ask

02:54.170 --> 02:56.452
to take a break for a few
hours from your schedule.

03:16.476 --> 03:19.540

<i>Bay: Come on, mom. What is with you?</i>

03:21.470 --> 03:22.676
You're like a cruise director

03:22.677 --> 03:23.979
on the boat to Christmas hell.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.351
It's one Christmas. And then we
can go back to doing it your way.

03:30.471 --> 03:33.456
My way? It's our way.

03:35.528 --> 03:38.144
I've always wanted to
have the kind of Christmas

03:38.162 --> 03:39.873
that you see in the movies.

03:40.074 --> 03:42.498
Why can't we have that just one time?

03:43.952 --> 03:45.616
You know what?

03:46.257 --> 03:47.500
You can.

03:47.620 --> 03:49.438
Have a good time with the Kennishes.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.184
Mom!

03:54.735 --> 03:56.912
Well, that was a disaster.

03:56.930 --> 03:58.549
Tell me about it.

03:59.729 --> 04:01.714
One last garlic knot.

04:01.933 --> 04:03.534
You girls want it?

04:06.443 --> 04:08.154
Split it?

04:09.279 --> 04:10.726
Thanks.

04:13.139 --> 04:16.512
You have to admit, life
would be a lot easier

04:16.531 --> 04:18.654
if we had never been switched.

04:18.902 --> 04:21.168

You've got to run three

Hey!Oh, hi!

10:06.997 --> 10:09.018
Why are you playing it so loud?

And that wouldn't bother you unless...

10:16.007 --> 10:17.359
I can.

10:18.082 --> 10:20.872
How did you know where to find me?

10:21.331 --> 10:24.641
Well, this is the house I grew up in.

10:24.761 --> 10:27.796
I think that you're me.

10:28.912 --> 10:31.006
Regina called me Daphne.

10:31.226 --> 10:33.512
Kathryn called me Bay.

10:33.796 --> 10:35.859

10:35.890 --> 10:38.141
But wait. Then wouldn't you

10:40.191 --> 10:41.488
You're right.

10:42.192 --> 10:44.753
If I'm in East Riverside,

10:44.787 --> 10:46.755
that means...

10:47.306 --> 10:49.684
The switch never happened.

Face me, please. I can't read your lips.

11:01.464 --> 11:06.002
Sorry. Your signing is amazing, by the way.

11:06.034 --> 11:07.016
It is.

11:07.136 --> 11:11.571
I guess I'm the one who got
meningitis when I was three.

11:11.781 --> 11:13.830
Hm... oh!

Ah!

11:21.744 --> 11:25.018
How do I sound? Do I have an accent?

11:25.053 --> 11:27.955
No. You must've had a
lot of speech therapy.

Ah. Huh.

11:30.916 --> 11:32.793
How do you like being deaf?

11:32.827 --> 11:35.529
How do you like being hearing?

11:35.563 --> 11:37.300
I had no idea

11:37.318 --> 11:39.632
that refrigerators made noise.

11:39.660 --> 11:43.054
And Kathryn's voice? (Sighs)

11:44.279 --> 11:46.932
It's not at all what I expected.

11:47.052 --> 11:48.907

11:48.926 --> 11:49.968
Ditto.

11:50.088 --> 11:51.311
How's my mom?

11:51.346 --> 11:54.578
Well, she owns her own hair salon.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.150
How are my parents?

11:57.185 --> 11:58.318
Well...

11:58.353 --> 12:01.594
Kathryn is a face cream mogul

12:01.621 --> 12:05.051
and John is a
stay-at-home soccer dad.

12:05.293 --> 12:06.533
So...

12:06.653 --> 12:09.450
What's the deal? I
mean, do we go with this?

12:09.487 --> 12:11.289
Or should we tell someone?

12:11.316 --> 12:13.233
Maybe see a doctor? I don't know.

12:13.556 --> 12:17.014
Well, the thing is
apparently, I have a show

12:17.038 --> 12:18.989
at the Templeton gallery.

12:19.501 --> 12:21.248
Good for you.

12:23.388 --> 12:25.501
I'm an Olympic hopeful.

12:26.748 --> 12:29.754
- This could be fun, right?
- Absolutely.

12:35.369 --> 12:37.830
- Good workout?
- Hey, you know, I was thinking

12:37.875 --> 12:40.097
maybe later we could
do some Kennish karaoke.

12:40.335 --> 12:41.927
We haven't done that in years.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.058

Well, I think it's great, but can you
keep it covered up for the next few days

13:03.357 --> 13:06.036
until I find a way to tell your father?

13:06.346 --> 13:08.377
I don't need John's approval

13:08.497 --> 13:10.399
for my ink or for anything else.

13:10.417 --> 13:12.274
Can you not be like this?

13:13.574 --> 13:15.087
<i>John!</i>

13:15.121 --> 13:17.155
Start the clock, little sis.

13:17.406 --> 13:19.811
'Cause mom's annual holiday guilt trip

13:19.826 --> 13:22.381
has got a 72-hour expiration date.

13:22.501 --> 13:25.030
Hey, c'mon. What's the rush?

13:27.100 --> 13:29.469
You took too many soccer balls to the head?

13:30.375 --> 13:33.302
Even the brand-new guitar
I know is under the tree

13:33.329 --> 13:36.192
can't hide John's
thinly-veiled disappointment.

13:36.312 --> 13:38.561
Come on. He's not that bad.

13:40.464 --> 13:44.197
Well, I see you're still using
your mom's beauty products.

13:44.225 --> 13:45.717
It's good to see you too, John.

13:45.963 --> 13:47.993
Bay, ready for some wind sprints?

13:48.030 --> 13:49.488
She just worked out.

13:49.522 --> 13:51.221
Yes, I'm aware of that, Kathryn.

13:51.258 --> 13:53.270
Olympic medalists don't just work out once

13:53.293 --> 13:56.028
and sit on their butts the rest
of the day. It's crunch time.

13:56.062 --> 13:57.670
But then again, why am I explaining that

13:57.679 --> 13:59.654
to someone who works 90 hours a week?

13:59.673 --> 14:02.200
Don't do that. Don't pit Bay against me.

14:02.235 --> 14:04.144
<i>John: I'm not pitting her against anybody.</i>

14:04.181 --> 14:06.943
<i>Kathryn: I have news for
you: Bay may win a gold medal,</i>

14:06.973 --> 14:08.224
<i>but that does not change the fact</i>

14:08.242 --> 14:09.942
that you were one-and-out
with the Royals.

14:09.976 --> 14:11.544
Let me explain something to you.

14:11.571 --> 14:13.053
I could've gone back to rehab,

14:13.090 --> 14:14.901
I could've gotten back out there.

14:15.114 --> 14:16.995
But who would've taken care of the kids?

14:16.995 --> 14:18.650
Someone needed to get a job,

14:18.685 --> 14:20.105
otherwise we'd be living on the streets.

14:20.142 --> 14:23.689
- You have no idea...
- Do you think I like working this hard?

14:23.723 --> 14:26.243
<i>You know I wanted to stay home
with the kids and write books.</i>

14:26.289 --> 14:28.594
<i>(John scoffs) Like that
was ever gonna happen.</i>

14:28.628 --> 14:30.478
I'll see you outside.

14:36.803 --> 14:38.337
Ta-da!

14:38.371 --> 14:40.868
Wow, you've really outdone yourself.

14:40.988 --> 14:43.575
I have never been so focused.

14:43.777 --> 14:45.889
Being deaf has its advantages.

14:46.877 --> 14:49.895
Not exactly Christmas
at Rockefeller Center.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.250
Hey, it's scrappy,

14:52.285 --> 14:53.772
just like us.

14:55.848 --> 14:58.976
What if we made our own tree?

14:59.488 --> 15:01.409
Right here would be perfect.

15:01.427 --> 15:03.192
On our living room wall?

15:03.312 --> 15:05.797
Anybody can buy a tree,

15:05.832 --> 15:09.622
but who else has multi-colored
branches and pointillist stars?

15:09.631 --> 15:11.451
<i>- (Cell phone buzzes)
- Oh!</i>

15:12.192 --> 15:14.067
_

15:14.396 --> 15:18.037
Uh, could the festivities
start in like an hour?

15:18.064 --> 15:20.690
- Emmett needs me for something.
- Of course.

15:20.810 --> 15:22.355
I can put on a coat of primer.

15:22.364 --> 15:23.946
It'll be ready by the time you get back.

15:24.066 --> 15:25.751
Awesome. Can't wait.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.761

15:40.987 --> 15:43.667

16:01.346 --> 16:03.990

16:06.807 --> 16:08.435
Hey. What's up?

16:13.832 --> 16:15.323

16:16.174 --> 16:19.274

16:19.906 --> 16:22.841
- Can we go?

16:32.161 --> 16:34.329

16:40.942 --> 16:42.561
Okay. It's a little avant-garde,

16:42.579 --> 16:44.189
but I can get on board.

17:13.749 --> 17:15.505
<i>(Angelo speaking French on
video) Joyeux NoÃ«l, maman !</i>

17:15.513 --> 17:18.156
Regarde comme elle est belle,
Daphne. On dirait Franka.

17:18.185 --> 17:21.029
Et le petit Angelo. Ah, il est
plus petit maintenant, c'est fini.

17:21.825 --> 17:23.553
Angelo, put the camera away.

17:23.553 --> 17:25.008
The kids want to open their gifts.

17:25.053 --> 17:26.627
<i>Angelo: Okay.</i>

17:26.955 --> 17:28.492
<i>(Angelo speaks French) Je t'aime maman.</i>

17:28.502 --> 17:30.669
Au revoir. Joyeux NoÃ«l.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.290
<i>Au revoir.</i>

17:38.163 --> 17:42.087
One, two, three... the winner!

17:49.871 --> 17:52.101
(Laughing)

18:09.002 --> 18:10.008
Hey.

18:10.128 --> 18:12.249
What the hell? You let her drink?

18:12.276 --> 18:15.286
I wasn't here. I was with Emmett.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.569
I'm sorry.

18:18.689 --> 18:20.883
I didn't know about this.

18:21.341 --> 18:23.554
I'll get some paint out of the garage.

18:24.131 --> 18:27.158
We'll cover it up so she's
not embarrassed in the morning.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.801
<i>Bay: This is unbelievable.</i>

18:40.969 --> 18:45.122
Apparently the only time Emmett
and I have been naked together,

18:45.405 --> 18:47.390
rubber duckies were involved.

18:47.510 --> 18:51.497
Ok, I'm telling you, J and
J are about 10 minutes away

18:51.506 --> 18:53.436
from a very conscious uncoupling.

18:53.556 --> 18:55.146
There's one more thing:

18:56.080 --> 18:57.525
Regina's drinking.

18:57.735 --> 18:59.025
Oh no.

18:59.145 --> 19:00.360
Again?

19:00.480 --> 19:02.647
I don't think she ever stopped.

19:02.884 --> 19:04.174
Think about it.

19:04.294 --> 19:07.787
She got sober after she
found out about the switch.

19:07.787 --> 19:09.845
If that never happened?

19:12.773 --> 19:14.428
What is happening there?

19:14.548 --> 19:20.245
_

19:22.915 --> 19:26.363
'Sup? I'm Tobias.

19:27.662 --> 19:29.198
_

19:29.500 --> 19:31.138
- _
- What's with the hand stuff?

19:31.174 --> 19:34.540
This is my friend Daphne.

19:34.832 --> 19:37.567
- She's deaf.
- Whoa. You...

19:37.687 --> 19:39.835
you don't hear anything?

19:41.381 --> 19:44.216
That's... that's profound.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.156
Well,

19:46.276 --> 19:49.824
I'm gonna hit up the Goodwill,
see what they got on vinyl.

19:56.665 --> 19:58.311
Oh, that was weird.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.854
We've got to get out of
this as soon as possible.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.318
What do they do in the movies?

20:02.354 --> 20:05.097
We need to, like, split a fortune cookie

20:05.125 --> 20:09.341
or snap a wishbone or something.

20:09.378 --> 20:10.466
The garlic knots!

20:10.503 --> 20:12.039
- Huh?
- From Sal's!

20:12.076 --> 20:14.015
Don't you remember? You and I were talking

20:14.061 --> 20:15.863
about how much easier life would be

20:15.983 --> 20:17.774
if the switch never happened.

20:17.894 --> 20:19.823
And we split the garlic knot!

20:19.919 --> 20:21.469
Toby said they were magic.

20:21.478 --> 20:23.922
So we have to go back and do it again.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.421
It's Christmas Eve.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.025
He's probably closed.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.028
I have an idea.

20:37.291 --> 20:39.129
This was your great idea?

20:39.147 --> 20:41.205
I was sure they would have

20:41.223 --> 20:43.394
some old garlic knots in here.

20:43.514 --> 20:44.662
Why don't we just wait

20:44.782 --> 20:48.302
for Sal's to reopen after Christmas?

20:49.070 --> 20:51.254
I think it'll be too late.

20:51.288 --> 20:53.745
A Christmas miracle in January?

20:54.038 --> 20:57.523
If it's a Christmas miracle
that undid the switch,

20:57.561 --> 21:00.577
then we need to recreate the moment...

21:00.605 --> 21:04.267
like, get our families
together again and wish it back.

21:04.721 --> 21:06.413
Really wishing I'd watched

21:06.437 --> 21:09.038
more of those stupid movies with my mom.

21:09.852 --> 21:12.074
<i>Man: Ho ho ho!</i>

21:13.099 --> 21:15.077
Are you... ?

21:16.602 --> 21:20.049
It's me. Sal. I dress up for the grandkids.

21:20.315 --> 21:22.611
You girls lose something?

21:25.109 --> 21:28.024
We ate some garlic knots the other night.

21:28.058 --> 21:29.826
Now we've switched places.

21:29.860 --> 21:32.843
Not exactly. We were switched before,

21:32.855 --> 21:36.899
and now we're not switched.
Do you have any more?

21:36.934 --> 21:40.503
Sorry. Gave all the leftovers
to the homeless shelter.

21:43.245 --> 21:44.891
And girls...

21:46.446 --> 21:49.528
The knot's not your answer.

21:49.546 --> 21:50.662
No, it is! It is!

21:50.681 --> 21:52.984
Don't you have the recipe?

21:53.003 --> 21:54.612
Maybe we could just make it ourselves.

21:54.622 --> 21:57.487
- I'm telling you...
- Sal, please!

21:59.356 --> 22:02.314
All right. Wait here.

22:06.383 --> 22:09.548
This is perfect. We'll
just make 'em ourselves.

22:09.668 --> 22:11.334
But if you're right,

22:11.368 --> 22:15.740
and we only have one
night to make this happen,

22:16.115 --> 22:18.877
how are we going to get
our families together?

22:19.334 --> 22:21.759
<i>Regina: Why on earth would
I want to spend Christmas Eve</i>

22:21.795 --> 22:23.652
in snooty Mission Hills?

22:24.146 --> 22:26.048
She's my new friend.

22:26.168 --> 22:28.316
- Who?
- Bay Kennish.

22:28.362 --> 22:30.730
She was nice enough to invite us over.

22:30.754 --> 22:31.965
We have to go.

22:31.983 --> 22:33.890
Wait, Kennish?

22:34.010 --> 22:35.962
Any relation to John Kennish?

22:35.980 --> 22:38.409
Yes! Yes! That's her dad.

22:38.431 --> 22:40.141
You could meet him.

22:40.141 --> 22:42.698
Isn't he the one who's married to...

22:42.733 --> 22:44.064
Kathryn Kennish.

22:44.101 --> 22:46.369
Of Kathryn Kennish Cosmetics.

22:47.183 --> 22:49.562
She's a big deal in the beauty industry.

22:49.571 --> 22:51.446
Who cares? Can we go?

22:53.970 --> 22:55.708
It's a Buckner program.

22:55.828 --> 22:58.150
Adopt a needy family for the holidays.

22:58.270 --> 23:01.058
<i>Toby: I'm with mom. Things are awkward
enough around here on Christmas Eve</i>

23:01.084 --> 23:02.595
without a bunch of strangers around.

23:02.622 --> 23:05.169
Well, they're not exactly strangers.

23:05.192 --> 23:06.592
Daphne's that friend of mine

23:06.712 --> 23:08.291
who's been teaching me sign language.

23:08.325 --> 23:10.159
The one I met?

23:10.193 --> 23:12.171
Yeah. Mom...

23:12.207 --> 23:15.031
Every year you say you
want to do more for charity,

23:15.254 --> 23:16.966
not just give money.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.473
She's right, mom.

23:18.519 --> 23:20.632
It's time the Kennishes start giving back.

23:21.282 --> 23:24.974
Okay, fine. Have them here at 7:00.

23:31.627 --> 23:34.717
<i>Hi! I'm so happy you guys could make it.</i>

23:34.751 --> 23:36.190
They're here!

23:36.310 --> 23:37.462
I'm...

23:37.487 --> 23:38.906
Bay.

23:39.026 --> 23:40.690
Nice to meet you.

23:42.793 --> 23:44.393
This is my dad John,

23:44.428 --> 23:46.864
my mom Kathryn, and my brother Toby.

23:46.900 --> 23:49.432
Mr. Kennish, it's an honor to meet you.

23:49.466 --> 23:50.934
Angelo Sorrento, Jr.

23:50.952 --> 23:53.269
Oh. Hey, Angelo. That's a great name.

23:53.614 --> 23:54.995
I'm a huge fan,

23:54.996 --> 23:57.227
I've never met a
professional athlete before.

23:57.858 --> 23:59.477
Angelo, why don't you come with me?

23:59.487 --> 24:01.654
I can show you a couple of
things from my Royals' days

24:01.682 --> 24:02.979
you might appreciate.

24:06.776 --> 24:08.131
It's nice to meet you.

24:08.148 --> 24:09.986
(Shouting) Thank you!

24:10.020 --> 24:11.871
Merry Christmas!

24:12.849 --> 24:15.245
No matter how loud you yell,

24:15.264 --> 24:17.285
she still can't hear you.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.225
Just

24:19.581 --> 24:21.493
make sure you face her and talk normal...

24:21.521 --> 24:23.551
not too fast, not too slow.

24:23.671 --> 24:24.867
Sorry.

24:24.901 --> 24:28.106
It's okay. Everybody does it.

24:29.773 --> 24:31.788
- You have a lovely home.
- Thank you.

24:31.819 --> 24:35.392
I was just going to go inside and
open a bottle of sauvignon blanc.

24:35.396 --> 24:36.545
You got any scotch?

24:36.580 --> 24:39.415
Yeah, of course. Let's go inside, come on.

24:49.719 --> 24:52.289
Oh, please don't start drinking on me.

24:52.326 --> 24:53.624
Oh, it's Regina's.

24:53.652 --> 24:54.896
I grabbed it when she set it down.

24:54.905 --> 24:57.164
Ah, good thinking. Okay, here.

24:57.284 --> 25:00.191
<i>- Bay: Start rolling this.
- Okay.</i>

25:03.502 --> 25:04.855
Mm...

25:05.165 --> 25:06.899
It's not working.

25:06.934 --> 25:11.011
Ah, we need to put flour down.

25:12.105 --> 25:16.087
<i>♪ ... joyful and triumphant ♪</i>

25:16.207 --> 25:19.782
<i>♪ oh, come ye oh, come ye ♪</i>

25:20.413 --> 25:22.848
Apparently I rock at this.

25:23.193 --> 25:27.501
What is going on? I can
only cook when I'm deaf?

25:27.621 --> 25:29.943
Maybe you were too busy
killing it on the soccer field?

25:29.952 --> 25:34.132
And you grew up with Angelo,
who's amazing in the kitchen.

25:36.171 --> 25:38.037
Oh crap.

25:38.961 --> 25:41.585
We have to drizzle truffle
oil on the garlic knots

25:41.585 --> 25:44.302
when they come out of the
oven. I forgot the truffle oil.

25:44.422 --> 25:47.769
We've gotta have every single thing right.

25:47.889 --> 25:48.903
What are we gonna do?

25:48.930 --> 25:51.377
I'll text Emmett. He owes me a favor.

25:51.411 --> 25:53.346

25:58.442 --> 25:59.549
your own skin care line.

25:59.567 --> 26:01.927
Your products are amazing.
I must have tried them all.

26:02.047 --> 26:03.829
It's not that exciting.

26:03.829 --> 26:06.747
I just saw a need in the
marketplace and I filled it.

26:07.497 --> 26:09.128
So what is it that you do?

26:09.162 --> 26:11.163
- I own a salon.
- Oh.

26:11.198 --> 26:14.233
We're small, but we have
a loyal customer base.

26:14.613 --> 26:17.503
I mean, it's nothing compared
to what you've accomplished.

26:17.540 --> 26:19.470
I've been in the beauty industry

26:19.488 --> 26:21.673
since I was 21. It's in my bones.

26:22.176 --> 26:25.645
So if you were ever looking for
an associate to help you out...

26:27.134 --> 26:29.484
I thought you said you owned a salon.

26:30.179 --> 26:33.060
I do, but...

26:33.654 --> 26:37.523
Business hasn't been so great, actually.

26:37.871 --> 26:40.326
We're shutting our
doors after the holidays.

26:40.707 --> 26:42.695
So the thing is...

26:43.615 --> 26:46.030
I'll keep you in mind if we get an opening.

would just go to a movie on Christmas day

27:34.571 --> 27:36.472

28:25.350 --> 28:31.240
I bought the entire Christmas
dinner at Whole Foods.

28:31.459 --> 28:36.032
I used to make a big deal about Christmas.

28:37.093 --> 28:42.481
12 kinds of cookies and
homemade peanut brittle.

28:43.817 --> 28:45.951
But no one seemed to care.

28:46.532 --> 28:49.623
And now I'm just too busy.

28:51.489 --> 28:53.492
