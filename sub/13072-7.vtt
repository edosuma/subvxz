WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:01.508
Previously on Guilt.

00:01.533 --> 00:02.833
When I was growing up,

00:02.868 --> 00:03.934
there was this dog, called Molly.

00:03.969 --> 00:05.669
She knew all my secrets.

00:05.704 --> 00:07.938
- Theo told me about Molly.
- He did?

00:07.973 --> 00:09.840
She wasn't a bloody dog, was she?

00:09.875 --> 00:11.775
Mr. Finch, what are you doing here?

00:11.810 --> 00:13.710
I got a little something to show you.

00:16.749 --> 00:18.548
Find me that ledger, or you'll be next.

00:18.584 --> 00:20.684
The last few months,
Molly saw only one client,

00:20.719 --> 00:21.818
Gentleman 33.

00:21.854 --> 00:23.520
You've seen him a few times, too.

00:23.555 --> 00:24.521
Yeah.

00:24.556 --> 00:25.956
- Any idea who he is?
- No.

00:25.991 --> 00:27.691
What do you want from me?

00:27.726 --> 00:29.526
I want you to stay away from Grace.

00:29.561 --> 00:31.528
<i>Any of your shady crap
blows back on her,</i>

00:31.563 --> 00:32.996
I will make you pay.

00:33.032 --> 00:35.532
Was that taken through Molly's window?

00:35.567 --> 00:37.431
Molly had a stalker,
and it was you, wasn't it?

00:37.467 --> 00:39.835
<i>After Molly died, I panicked
and nicked her phone.</i>

00:39.860 --> 00:41.092
There were threatening texts

00:41.127 --> 00:43.507
from Finch all over it.
I think he killed her.

00:43.532 --> 00:45.876
<i>We need to plant the phone
in his car and turn it on.</i>

00:45.911 --> 00:47.481
<i>The police will track it
straight to Finch.</i>

00:47.516 --> 00:49.482
If one of us starts cozying up to Finch,

00:49.518 --> 00:51.383
he'll definitely know something's dodgy.

00:51.419 --> 00:52.950
<i>That's why we need my sister.</i>

00:52.985 --> 00:54.818
<i>She's a bloody prosecutor.</i>

00:54.853 --> 00:56.887
<i>He doesn't have to know
that's what we're doing.</i>

00:56.922 --> 00:58.555
You sick bastard.

00:59.925 --> 01:01.558
Oh, Grace.

01:01.593 --> 01:03.894
Now do you like me better than Molly?

01:03.929 --> 01:05.929
She was gone longer than
a few minutes, wasn't she?

01:05.965 --> 01:06.897
Tell me, how long, Luc.

01:06.932 --> 01:07.931
How long was she gone?

01:07.967 --> 01:09.649
How long was she gone for, Luc!?

01:09.684 --> 01:11.535
Close to an hour.

01:11.570 --> 01:12.636
We have a warrant.

01:12.671 --> 01:13.397
<i>You're under arrest</i>

01:13.432 --> 01:14.871
<i>for the murder of Molly Ryan.</i>

01:14.907 --> 01:16.082
<i>It's going to be okay.</i>

01:16.118 --> 01:17.649
<i>Stan and I will sort this out.</i>

01:17.684 --> 01:18.875
<i>You just need to be strong.</i>

01:24.817 --> 01:25.816
Turn to the right.

01:27.786 --> 01:30.176
<i>At 6:12 this morning,</i>

01:30.211 --> 01:31.922
<i>Scotland Yard executed an arrest warrant</i>

01:31.957 --> 01:34.431
for Grace Atwood
in the murder of Molly Ryan.

01:36.256 --> 01:38.423
<i>The police and the
Crown Prosecutor's Office</i>

01:38.458 --> 01:40.325
have been working around the
clock on this investigation,

01:40.360 --> 01:42.360
<i>and we're confident that the
overwhelming evidence</i>

01:42.396 --> 01:45.463
<i>against Grace Atwood will
prove, beyond any doubt,</i>

01:45.499 --> 01:48.400
<i>she murdered her flatmate, Molly Ryan.</i>

01:48.435 --> 01:49.601
Take off your clothes.

01:54.474 --> 01:56.508
<i>Now, Molly and her family deserve</i>

01:56.543 --> 01:58.410
swift and strong justice.

02:41.388 --> 02:43.455
Hello there.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.523
Where'd you come from?

02:45.559 --> 02:47.302
Isn't she adorable?

02:48.628 --> 02:50.828
I thought a new puppy might put
an end to your nightmares.

02:51.631 --> 02:53.398
How thoughtful.

02:53.575 --> 02:55.129
I think we should call her Molly.

02:55.569 --> 02:56.601
Don't you?

02:59.339 --> 03:00.338
Yes.

03:00.921 --> 03:02.373
Yes. That would be wonderful.

03:03.137 --> 03:04.275
What a sweet gesture, darling.

03:04.311 --> 03:05.510
Oh.

03:05.545 --> 03:07.312
I have my ulterior motives.

03:09.553 --> 03:12.061
You said I need to find
something that's all mine.

03:12.486 --> 03:15.186
Well, I think we need something
that's ours.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.704
I want us to take care
of Molly together.

03:18.097 --> 03:20.558
Make sure she never wanders
into any trouble.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.047
Would you like that?

03:22.574 --> 03:23.651
I'd love that.

03:43.316 --> 03:46.618
So Molly Ryan was a high-priced hooker?

03:46.653 --> 03:48.486
Well, Merry Christmas.

03:48.522 --> 03:50.622
Do you have any idea how many
alternate suspects

03:50.657 --> 03:53.069
- this Courtenay thing opens up?
- A truckload.

03:53.104 --> 03:54.628
But my money's on Finch.

03:54.663 --> 03:56.661
I cannot wait to see
Gwendolyn Hall's face

03:56.696 --> 03:59.330
when she realizes she arrested Grace

03:59.366 --> 04:01.599
while a secret society of sickos

04:01.635 --> 04:03.829
was left free to murder young women.

04:03.864 --> 04:06.251
Secret Society of Sickos
does have a nice ring to it.

04:06.286 --> 04:07.205
There's one other thing.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.373
Yeah.

04:08.802 --> 04:10.992
Finch had all these videos of girls.

04:11.027 --> 04:12.925
There was one labeled Molly, but...

04:15.722 --> 04:17.529
...there was one for Grace, too.

04:25.225 --> 04:27.158
- Stan!
- Wh... I'm sorry.

04:27.194 --> 04:28.560
Did you want to give that to the police?

04:28.595 --> 04:31.010
Because I'm sure that whatever was

04:31.045 --> 04:33.231
on there is not our friend.

04:33.266 --> 04:34.332
And you "borrowing" it

04:34.367 --> 04:35.939
doesn't look very good, either.

04:37.437 --> 04:39.277
Even after watching that video,

04:39.312 --> 04:41.272
I still can't believe Grace did that.

04:42.342 --> 04:43.641
I thought I knew her.

04:45.445 --> 04:47.545
Did you ever think you'd seduce
a dangerous criminal

04:47.581 --> 04:49.414
for a set of car keys?

04:49.449 --> 04:51.516
We all do things we're not
proud of sometimes.

04:51.551 --> 04:54.219
I'm going to go see Grace this morning.

04:54.254 --> 04:55.825
See if we can break Luc's timeline

04:55.860 --> 04:57.188
for when he said she was up on the roof.

04:57.224 --> 04:58.489
I'm going to go blow
the Courtenay wide open

04:58.525 --> 05:00.325
and get your sister out of jail.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.135
If Finch was able to keep
the best little whorehouse

05:02.170 --> 05:04.170
in London under wraps for this long,

05:04.206 --> 05:06.539
we can't count on the cops
tying him to it now.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.956
<i>You missed the press conference.</i>

05:09.981 --> 05:11.569
You should have been there.

05:11.604 --> 05:14.147
- Share in the glory.
- Something's come up, Gwen.

05:14.182 --> 05:15.651
Is that...?

05:17.187 --> 05:18.618
It's Martin Finch.

05:19.287 --> 05:21.076
Finch!

05:21.523 --> 05:23.423
Well, you're having a big
morning, aren't you?

05:23.458 --> 05:25.491
I've been trying to build a case
against this guy for years.

05:25.527 --> 05:27.260
Nothing ever sticks.

05:27.295 --> 05:28.604
What'd you bring him in on?

05:30.632 --> 05:32.294
Suspicion of murder.

05:32.329 --> 05:33.433
Surprise.

05:34.006 --> 05:35.502
We found Molly Ryan's phone

05:35.537 --> 05:37.024
in his car this morning.

05:38.340 --> 05:40.373
- What?
- He switched it on.

05:40.408 --> 05:43.008
We've had a tracker on it
since the morning she died.

05:43.044 --> 05:44.277
We had to act quickly

05:44.312 --> 05:46.212
before it got switched off again
and the trail went cold.

05:46.248 --> 05:47.820
Our techies are working on it right now.

05:47.856 --> 05:48.840
Okay, so, wait.

05:48.875 --> 05:51.517
Hours after Grace Atwood's arrest,

05:51.553 --> 05:54.187
you arrest a career criminal
for the same murder.

05:54.222 --> 05:56.893
You, you do realize that that
could spell reasonable doubt

05:56.929 --> 05:59.359
- for both of them?
- What was I supposed to do?

05:59.394 --> 06:01.135
Just let him walk, maybe go on the run?

06:01.170 --> 06:03.329
He owns the club that Molly went to

06:03.365 --> 06:05.164
the night that she died.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.499
He's got her phone.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.501
- He's got a reputation for violence.
- I know that.

06:10.238 --> 06:11.337
I just stood in front of the world,

06:11.373 --> 06:12.765
and promised justice.

06:13.408 --> 06:15.575
Justice for Molly Ryan's family,
and now,

06:16.151 --> 06:18.545
I might not even get a conviction.

06:18.808 --> 06:19.926
And Finch...

06:20.415 --> 06:22.615
what if Finch did this, and I've just

06:22.651 --> 06:24.384
rushed to judgment on Grace Atwood.

06:24.419 --> 06:25.502
Stop.

06:26.588 --> 06:29.455
You had solid evidence against Grace.

06:29.491 --> 06:31.357
I wouldn't have put those
handcuffs on her

06:31.393 --> 06:34.527
if I didn't stand by your
decision to have her arrested.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.983
But we've got new evidence
to consider now.

06:37.432 --> 06:40.454
It's not that simple, is it?

06:41.236 --> 06:42.402
No.

06:42.437 --> 06:44.270
But one thing is:

06:44.306 --> 06:46.205
we will not rest

06:46.241 --> 06:49.575
until Molly Ryan's killer
is brought to justice.

06:59.220 --> 07:00.453
- Hi, Nat.
- Ugh.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.998
Are you okay?

07:02.557 --> 07:04.157
I'm fine.

07:04.192 --> 07:06.192
You look... you look great.

07:09.331 --> 07:11.164
Stan found a loophole
in the British system

07:11.199 --> 07:13.132
that allows me to be part
of his legal team.

07:13.168 --> 07:15.168
Technically, I'm his intern.

07:15.203 --> 07:17.146
You know how much he loves that, but...

07:17.505 --> 07:19.205
it means I'm covered
under attorney-client

07:19.240 --> 07:20.593
confidentiality.

07:23.278 --> 07:24.330
I, um...

07:27.282 --> 07:29.182
I found something in Finch's office.

07:30.385 --> 07:31.417
A video of you...

07:33.259 --> 07:34.225
...and him.

07:34.564 --> 07:36.061
He was taping me.

07:36.097 --> 07:37.590
Oh, my God...
I cannot believe you saw that.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.392
I was so stupid.

07:39.427 --> 07:40.560
I just...

07:40.595 --> 07:42.195
Grace.

07:43.665 --> 07:46.232
Did you work at the Courtenay?

07:46.267 --> 07:47.233
Like Molly?

07:47.268 --> 07:48.401
Molly and Roz made it sound

07:48.436 --> 07:51.237
so glamorous,

07:51.272 --> 07:52.372
so exciting.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.575
So I went one night.

07:55.610 --> 07:59.986
And-and at first, it was... thrilling.

08:00.534 --> 08:02.382
And-and you have on these masks,

08:02.417 --> 08:06.386
so it doesn't even feel like you.

08:06.735 --> 08:07.888
You know?

08:12.193 --> 08:16.159
Then I was chosen, and we went upstairs.

08:17.432 --> 08:21.434
And it wasn't exciting
or glamorous at all,

08:21.469 --> 08:25.304
it was just a... stranger
who expected me

08:25.340 --> 08:27.507
to do things to him, for money.

08:29.999 --> 08:32.511
So I ran out before we...

08:33.543 --> 08:34.414
you know.

08:36.879 --> 08:38.618
Do you think it will come out
at the trial?

08:38.653 --> 08:40.553
Uh, I don't know.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.389
I mean, we have to be prepared
for everything.

08:43.424 --> 08:45.358
Our bigger problem is how to prove

08:45.393 --> 08:47.193
that Luc lied to save his own ass

08:47.228 --> 08:49.295
when he said that you were gone
from the roof for so long.

08:49.330 --> 08:51.264
It's hard in these "he said-she said"

08:51.299 --> 08:53.266
situations, but he has
a record, so that's...

08:53.301 --> 08:54.300
He didn't lie.

08:55.470 --> 08:56.469
What?

08:57.979 --> 08:59.178
He didn't lie.

08:59.662 --> 09:01.575
Luc told me that morning.

09:02.347 --> 09:05.578
I left the roof and I didn't
come back for...

09:06.506 --> 09:08.481
an hour, maybe more.

09:10.151 --> 09:11.217
Grace.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.752
I can't remember any of it.

09:18.961 --> 09:21.260
I was so wasted,
I must have blacked out.

09:21.618 --> 09:23.330
We knew how bad it would look,

09:23.364 --> 09:27.567
so we decided to just
say that I went down to pee.

09:29.841 --> 09:31.970
Luc swore he'd never
tell anyone the truth.

09:33.337 --> 09:34.795
You don't remember anything?

09:36.578 --> 09:38.377
Maybe you did go down to pee,

09:38.413 --> 09:40.446
and you passed out
when you were down there.

09:41.082 --> 09:43.190
That would explain why you
were gone for so long,

09:43.224 --> 09:44.317
and it's-it's consistent with

09:44.352 --> 09:45.451
the amount of
alcohol and drugs you used...

09:45.487 --> 09:47.587
Yeah, but I was really mad...

09:48.110 --> 09:51.624
that night... at Molly.

09:52.410 --> 09:53.493
I saw her with Luc.

09:53.528 --> 09:56.295
She was all over him at the club,

09:56.331 --> 09:58.098
and I was just...

10:00.100 --> 10:01.447
I was furious.

10:07.509 --> 10:09.408
What if I snapped, Natalie?

10:12.413 --> 10:14.098
What if I killed Molly?

10:20.249 --> 10:23.550
Don't let your fat friend hog it all.

10:23.585 --> 10:26.075
So what's this scoop of
the century, Gutterie?

10:26.110 --> 10:27.262
You want to go?

10:27.297 --> 10:29.656
I didn't come all the way
across town to feed the ducks.

10:29.691 --> 10:32.526
- You have a story for me or not?
- You really should try this one.

10:32.561 --> 10:35.562
It's very relaxing, too.
You look really stressed out.

10:39.501 --> 10:41.668
Molly Ryan was a whore.

10:43.672 --> 10:44.993
That's your story?

10:45.018 --> 10:47.757
- The victim was a slut.
- I meant she was a whore

10:47.793 --> 10:50.632
in the old-fashioned sense of the word.

10:51.313 --> 10:54.134
She was an escort
for an ultra-exclusive,

10:54.169 --> 10:55.699
ultra-private sex club.

10:55.724 --> 10:57.252
Does this little club have a name?

10:57.277 --> 10:58.007
Yeah.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.306
The Courtenay.

11:00.622 --> 11:02.611
And when I say exclusive

11:02.647 --> 11:05.085
and secret, I mean men and women

11:05.120 --> 11:07.230
at the highest level of government,

11:07.266 --> 11:09.072
of industry, of society

11:09.092 --> 11:11.860
paying a fortune to exorcize
their kinkiest demons.

11:11.895 --> 11:13.995
- Well, I can quote you on this?
- No.

11:14.031 --> 11:16.998
Well, maybe in a Deep Throat
kind of way.

11:17.034 --> 11:19.577
It doesn't look good
for my client if I'm smearing

11:19.602 --> 11:21.870
- the victim's name.
- Why are you coming to me with this?

11:21.905 --> 11:24.615
Wh-Why didn't you go to the AP?
The <i> Times?</i>

11:24.650 --> 11:26.708
- The BBC?
- Cause half the brass at those dinosaurs

11:26.743 --> 11:28.043
are probably Courtenay clients.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.879
I can't trust any
of the old guard not to kill it.

11:30.914 --> 11:32.948
But you... you are young, you're hungry.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.983
You'd be crazy not to chase this lead.

11:35.549 --> 11:39.589
Or you think I'm too naive
not to see your real agenda.

11:39.890 --> 11:41.756
You want to create a media storm

11:41.792 --> 11:43.609
that'll draw attention away
from your client,

11:43.894 --> 11:46.795
give the public
some posh perverts to feast on,

11:46.830 --> 11:49.130
creating reasonable doubt
for Grace Atwood.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.066
But I'm not your patsy, Gutterie.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.968
I'm not gonna print your lies
and wind up a joke.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.903
- They are not lies.
- Where's your proof?

11:54.938 --> 11:56.805
Do you have pictures,
client lists, receipts?

11:56.840 --> 11:58.873
I thought you had the guts
to run with this.

11:58.909 --> 12:00.108
Maybe I was wrong about you.

12:01.912 --> 12:04.746
Call me when you've got hard proof.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.212
_

12:23.700 --> 12:25.033
I heard about Grace.

12:25.068 --> 12:27.702
I know you asked me
to stay away, but I couldn't.

12:27.738 --> 12:29.037
Not-not when she's in prison.

12:32.009 --> 12:33.288
Do you want to come in?

12:33.993 --> 12:35.076
Thanks.

12:38.749 --> 12:39.814
Where's Gutterie?

12:39.850 --> 12:40.949
What-what's he doing about this?

12:41.657 --> 12:43.172
He's out working an angle.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.794
Have you seen her? Since, uh...

12:44.830 --> 12:46.029
Yeah, this morning.

12:46.064 --> 12:47.442
How is she?

12:47.799 --> 12:48.898
Not great.

12:52.299 --> 12:54.170
You're researching
diminished responsibility?

12:56.231 --> 12:58.374
Oh, God. You think she did this.

13:01.012 --> 13:03.880
When I was away at college
and Grace was in high school,

13:03.915 --> 13:06.649
did she ever have blackouts?

13:06.685 --> 13:08.718
Do things that
she couldn't remember later?

13:08.754 --> 13:09.886
She was an average teenager.

13:09.921 --> 13:11.988
She went out, she got drunk sometimes,

13:12.023 --> 13:14.791
did some stupid things, but nothing...

13:19.650 --> 13:20.964
You should go and see her.

13:20.999 --> 13:22.566
She loves you.

13:23.001 --> 13:25.835
And she can use all the support
she can get right now.

13:36.081 --> 13:38.882
- You look like crap.
- Did you bring it?

13:40.152 --> 13:42.085
You better find someone
willing to sell to you,

13:42.120 --> 13:45.220
'cause this is the last
time I'm gonna be your mule.

13:45.957 --> 13:47.314
Like I've never done anything for you.

13:51.354 --> 13:52.762
You could always quit, you know.

13:52.798 --> 13:54.187
I don't need a lecture right now.

13:56.447 --> 13:57.834
I tried to visit Grace.

13:57.869 --> 13:59.102
She refused to see me.

14:00.138 --> 14:01.771
What if she goes away because of me?

14:01.807 --> 14:03.106
Don't go down that hole, Luc.

14:03.141 --> 14:04.874
Finch got nabbed this morning.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.521
The police are sure to let Grace go now.

14:06.557 --> 14:08.912
Especially with
that fancy lawyer of hers.

14:08.947 --> 14:10.151
She's golden.

14:10.186 --> 14:11.686
- She's in jail.
- So were you.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.526
Now you're out.

14:15.693 --> 14:16.792
I'm gonna go.

14:16.955 --> 14:18.087
I'm late for work.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.056
Roz.

14:22.608 --> 14:24.861
You gonna run that place
if Finch goes down?

14:25.563 --> 14:26.796
Someone's got to.

14:38.810 --> 14:41.744
You own the night-club Diablo.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.046
Is that your only source of income?

14:43.081 --> 14:44.814
I have a variety of
entrepreneurial interests.

14:44.850 --> 14:45.982
I'm sure you do.

14:46.017 --> 14:47.492
We're not here to indulge

14:47.527 --> 14:49.953
a fishing expedition,
Detective Inspector.

14:49.988 --> 14:52.345
Let's get right on with it,
then, shall we?

14:52.924 --> 14:54.057
We found text messages

14:54.092 --> 14:57.257
from you on Molly Ryan's phone.

14:57.839 --> 15:00.719
"Do you know who put those
Lou... boutins..."

15:00.754 --> 15:02.065
Louboutins.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.934
"...Louboutins on your feet,
little girl?

15:04.970 --> 15:07.804
You better walk them
back in here or you're dead."

15:08.669 --> 15:09.582
And then there's,

15:09.607 --> 15:11.312
"I'm not messing about, bitch.

15:11.347 --> 15:14.122
"Your sweet ass better
show up tomorrow night...

15:14.980 --> 15:16.646
or I'll kill you."

15:16.681 --> 15:18.422
I see a theme here.

15:18.457 --> 15:20.589
Did you make good
on your threats, Mr. Finch?

15:20.624 --> 15:21.651
Don't answer that.

15:21.686 --> 15:23.393
Actually, I think
I would like to respond.

15:23.855 --> 15:25.822
Molly worked for me at Diablo.

15:25.857 --> 15:27.724
She was a bottle service girl.

15:27.759 --> 15:29.338
She was good at bringing in
the high rollers

15:29.374 --> 15:30.927
and I compensated her well for it.

15:30.962 --> 15:34.097
So when she quit without notice,

15:34.132 --> 15:35.832
it left me in a jam.

15:35.867 --> 15:37.133
I was angry,

15:37.168 --> 15:38.968
said some unpleasant things.

15:39.004 --> 15:41.059
Things that I regret.

15:41.706 --> 15:43.840
But... I didn't kill her.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.875
Then how did her phone
wind up in your car?

15:45.911 --> 15:46.976
Clearly someone planted it.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.144
And I have a good idea

15:48.179 --> 15:49.746
who was in on it.

15:50.291 --> 15:51.748
Last night...

15:52.705 --> 15:54.717
...this sexy, redheaded American girl

15:54.753 --> 15:55.885
was all over me.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.301
She seduced me upstairs,

15:57.956 --> 15:59.055
and just when things
were getting heated,

15:59.090 --> 16:01.264
the bloody fire alarm went off.

16:01.826 --> 16:02.992
So I went down to check on it

16:03.434 --> 16:05.061
and guess what I left her alone with?

16:05.409 --> 16:07.184
My car keys.

16:07.699 --> 16:09.098
Next thing I know, you chaps

16:09.134 --> 16:11.701
have pulled a phone from my car.

16:14.706 --> 16:16.105
You think that's a coincidence?

16:18.910 --> 16:21.358
You got ten minutes to shower,

16:21.364 --> 16:23.016
go to the loo and do your business.

16:23.081 --> 16:24.681
Then it's back to your cell.

17:01.987 --> 17:05.788
Too good to shower with us, rich girl?

17:06.790 --> 17:08.090
No. I, um...

17:29.327 --> 17:32.228
This was taken a few
minutes after Molly was killed.

17:32.263 --> 17:33.996
We knew that it alibi'd Roz,

17:34.032 --> 17:36.098
but Finch wasn't on our radar back then.

17:36.134 --> 17:38.868
There's no way that
he could have killed Molly

17:38.903 --> 17:40.303
and gotten back
to Club Diablo so quickly.

17:40.338 --> 17:42.276
And the phone in the car?

17:42.907 --> 17:44.232
Did he say how it got there?

17:44.643 --> 17:46.302
I can show you how it got there.

17:46.327 --> 17:48.664
When you buy a car
that costs more than my house,

17:48.700 --> 17:50.046
they come with some flashy features.

17:50.081 --> 17:51.727
Finch's had a security camera

17:51.762 --> 17:52.977
in the dash.

17:53.002 --> 17:55.151
And guess who put in
a starring appearance?

17:56.081 --> 17:58.581
Smile, Grace, you're on <i> Candid Camera.</i>

18:01.586 --> 18:02.885
Thank God.

18:02.921 --> 18:04.754
You saw Grace

18:05.223 --> 18:06.839
right from the start.

18:07.892 --> 18:09.280
I didn't.

18:09.661 --> 18:12.829
We've all made mistakes
on this one, Detective.

18:28.013 --> 18:31.462
Your sister...
she broke into Finch's car

18:31.497 --> 18:32.949
and planted Molly Ryan's phone.

18:32.984 --> 18:35.755
Grace tried to frame him
for a murder she committed.

18:36.621 --> 18:37.920
I had a little chat with Finch

18:37.964 --> 18:39.931
and he seems to think
that it all went down

18:39.966 --> 18:42.470
with the help of
a redheaded American girl

18:42.505 --> 18:44.769
who seduced him to get his car keys.

18:46.546 --> 18:47.839
You're a prosecutor, Natalie.

18:47.874 --> 18:48.627
You know better.

18:49.042 --> 18:50.641
You could get disbarred for this.

18:51.161 --> 18:52.010
You could go to jail.

18:52.045 --> 18:55.046
I mean, I-I understand that you
want to protect your sister,

18:55.081 --> 18:57.055
- but planting evidence...
- I didn't...

18:57.090 --> 18:57.970
You didn't what?

18:58.337 --> 18:59.917
Can we speak in hypotheticals?

18:59.953 --> 19:01.919
Natalie, what do you think
I'm doing here?

19:01.955 --> 19:03.654
I want to help you.

19:08.828 --> 19:10.762
Let's just say... hypothetically...

19:10.797 --> 19:12.973
there was a redheaded
American girl involved.

19:13.700 --> 19:15.700
Then she would have thought
her sister was simply

19:15.735 --> 19:18.036
turning on a phone
that was already in the car.

19:18.071 --> 19:19.771
She would have thought
she was helping the police

19:19.806 --> 19:21.606
track missing evidence
to the real killer.

19:23.777 --> 19:25.043
You got played.

19:25.717 --> 19:28.517
Your sister used you to save herself.

19:28.748 --> 19:31.015
I'm gonna do my best
to keep you out of this,

19:31.356 --> 19:32.717
but you need to wake up.

19:32.752 --> 19:34.018
You need to open your eyes

19:34.054 --> 19:36.651
and see her for who...
for what... she really is.

19:36.687 --> 19:38.773
She's manipulated you
through all of this.

19:38.809 --> 19:40.992
Luc, the media,

19:41.027 --> 19:44.729
even me, but it ends right now.

19:44.764 --> 19:47.899
And if you don't want to wind up
in a jail cell next to her,

19:47.934 --> 19:49.767
you'd better stay the hell away

19:49.803 --> 19:51.669
from this investigation from now on.

20:06.019 --> 20:08.052
What are you doing here?

20:08.587 --> 20:10.822
- I have a client.
- It's not safe for you here.

20:10.857 --> 20:12.824
Not after you helped
Patrick Ryan sneak out

20:12.859 --> 20:14.892
with our client list down his pants.

20:14.928 --> 20:16.727
I'm good with Finch.

20:17.931 --> 20:19.664
I, uh, made myself valuable.

20:20.700 --> 20:22.100
You're not the only one

20:22.135 --> 20:23.835
who knows how to handle him.

20:23.870 --> 20:26.130
Look at you,
handling the boss now, are we?

20:26.773 --> 20:28.973
Gentleman 33 is ready
for his Irish Ginger.

20:29.546 --> 20:32.643
Well, better not keep him waiting.

20:36.106 --> 20:37.682
Watch yourself, Kaley.

20:38.662 --> 20:39.744
This isn't a game.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.350
Thank you.

21:29.102 --> 21:31.035
I'm so sorry.

21:31.444 --> 21:33.104
I wish you didn't have
to see me in here.

21:33.139 --> 21:34.594
No, uh, Grace.

21:35.108 --> 21:37.008
I'm-I'm the one who should be sorry.

21:37.043 --> 21:39.371
I-I haven't been there for you

21:39.406 --> 21:40.978
- the way I should have been.
- Yes, you have.

21:41.014 --> 21:43.848
No, no, especially after
your mother died.

21:43.883 --> 21:45.650
I threw myself into my business.

21:45.685 --> 21:48.986
I convinced myself that I was
helping you and Natalie

21:49.022 --> 21:50.536
by building my business.

21:50.571 --> 21:52.254
You have been there for me, James.

21:52.992 --> 21:54.283
You know you have.

21:55.862 --> 21:58.796
You know, after my dad died...

22:01.742 --> 22:03.302
...I was so sad,

22:03.903 --> 22:06.771
but then, then you came into our lives

22:06.806 --> 22:09.819
and-and you did whatever
you could to make me smile.

22:10.910 --> 22:14.645
You... you-you sang me
to sleep at night.

22:14.681 --> 22:18.519
And... and played silly games, and...

22:21.054 --> 22:23.821
And made it okay for me to laugh again.

22:30.376 --> 22:31.409
What if I never get out?

22:31.464 --> 22:33.941
Shh. Don't say that, sweetheart.

22:38.004 --> 22:39.194
I'm scared, James.

22:40.539 --> 22:42.300
I'm so scared.

I enjoy this.

23:55.715 --> 23:56.881
There's something special

23:56.916 --> 23:58.883

24:33.319 --> 24:34.693
You disobeyed orders, Kaley.

24:37.256 --> 24:39.356
You'll have to face the consequences.

24:47.623 --> 24:49.261
and you'll obey my orders.

24:51.557 --> 24:53.860
Untie me, now.

25:18.787 --> 25:20.222
Now...

25:21.270 --> 25:22.988
it's your turn to be tied up.

25:30.699 --> 25:32.293
You remind me of someone.

25:34.636 --> 25:36.159
Someone I enjoyed spending time with.

25:56.692 --> 25:58.226
You know, this never gets old.

26:03.966 --> 26:05.866
Look, I know
I got the good stuff, but...

26:05.901 --> 26:08.292
Hotel bar kicked me out.
I'm not done yet.

26:08.327 --> 26:09.341
Okay.

26:13.549 --> 26:14.654
I'm a prosecutor.

26:14.689 --> 26:15.742
I've devoted my whole life

26:15.778 --> 26:17.336
to putting the bad guys behind bars.

26:18.358 --> 26:19.613
You once asked me what I would do

26:19.648 --> 26:21.774
if I found out my sister
was the bad guy.

26:23.106 --> 26:24.017
Guess what?

26:24.637 --> 26:25.851
She is.

26:26.224 --> 26:28.722
I can't defend her
anymore, Stan. I can't.

26:29.159 --> 26:30.824
- Grace lied to me.
- Mm-hmm.

26:31.391 --> 26:33.726
She told me that Finch guy
had Molly's phone.

26:33.762 --> 26:35.241
All we had to do was turn it on.

26:35.277 --> 26:37.554
But Grace had the phone the whole time.

26:38.777 --> 26:40.900
She tried to frame a man for murder.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.569
She conned me.

26:42.604 --> 26:44.352
She conned Roz. She's probably lying

26:44.388 --> 26:46.039
about that sex club, too.
Both of her roommates

26:46.074 --> 26:48.833
- worked there.
- Wait a minute. Back it up.

26:48.869 --> 26:50.577
Are you saying that the DJ

26:50.612 --> 26:52.288
worked at The Courtenay as well?

26:52.323 --> 26:54.291
Yeah, she's the madam, or the booker,

26:54.327 --> 26:55.649
- or something like that.
- Then how do you know

26:55.684 --> 26:57.684
that Roz didn't have
Molly's phone and not Grace?

26:57.719 --> 26:59.519
Because Grace is a freaking liar.

26:59.555 --> 27:02.218
She's probably lying
about this blackout, too.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.858
It's just her latest excuse
to save herself.

27:05.450 --> 27:07.661
I don't think she has
diminished responsibility.

27:11.849 --> 27:14.473
I think she's a full-blown sociopath.

27:16.672 --> 27:18.481
All right, Natalie,
whatever you may think

27:18.516 --> 27:19.706
of Grace right now...

27:19.741 --> 27:22.420
innocent, guilty, or sociopath...

27:22.456 --> 27:24.623
the fact of the matter is,
she is still your sister.

27:25.245 --> 27:26.680
And I know you.

27:26.715 --> 27:29.164
You'll never forgive yourself
if you give up on her.

27:31.887 --> 27:34.053
What do you know about family?

27:34.918 --> 27:37.557
Not a lot, unfortunately.

27:37.593 --> 27:40.794
But... I do know
a thing or two about guilt.

27:53.041 --> 27:55.487
You wake anyone,

27:55.522 --> 27:56.776
you're a dead girl.

27:59.515 --> 28:00.880
I'm already dead.

28:01.572 --> 28:02.723
I heard about the showers.

28:02.759 --> 28:04.356
You better learn quick.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.158
Gotta start protecting yourself.

28:07.223 --> 28:08.010
How?

28:08.610 --> 28:09.664
Your pick.

28:09.700 --> 28:11.184
Get yourself a shank,

28:11.702 --> 28:13.568
or give the guards a wank.

28:49.737 --> 28:53.263
_

29:23.974 --> 29:26.775
Roz Walters?

29:28.679 --> 29:30.946
We haven't been properly introduced.

29:32.110 --> 29:33.445
Stan Gutterie.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.684
You scammed me for 30,000 pounds.

29:37.621 --> 29:38.753
Don't know what you're talking about.

29:40.791 --> 29:42.557
You know, for all her faults,

29:42.593 --> 29:45.106
Grace... she wouldn't blackmail James.

29:45.141 --> 29:46.629
Which leaves you holding the phone.

29:46.665 --> 29:47.829
Now, don't worry.

29:47.864 --> 29:49.598
I'm not here to shake you down
for the money.

29:49.633 --> 29:51.163
Frankly, I like your style.

29:51.199 --> 29:52.968
Hiring those football hooligans,

29:53.003 --> 29:54.736
that was, that was very clever.

29:55.471 --> 29:57.155
Look, I was in a tough spot.

29:57.191 --> 29:58.673
- I needed the money.
- Yeah, I know.

29:58.709 --> 30:01.416
You work for the bad man,
Finch, don't you?

30:01.452 --> 30:03.332
My guess is he's got something to do

30:03.367 --> 30:04.679
with why you needed the money.

30:04.715 --> 30:07.580
And why you'd help Grace
frame him for murder.

30:08.975 --> 30:10.585
That was Grace's idea.

30:10.621 --> 30:12.363
So you say.

30:13.468 --> 30:14.907
You know what I say?

30:15.626 --> 30:16.925
I say...

30:16.960 --> 30:18.960
let bygones be bygones.

30:19.236 --> 30:20.894
And I know just how
you can make it up to me.

30:21.819 --> 30:24.666
In keeping with
our little phone theme...

30:24.963 --> 30:26.601
I got you one.

30:27.235 --> 30:28.462
Now, it's going to ring

30:28.497 --> 30:30.144
and you're going to answer

30:30.179 --> 30:31.504
and you're going to have a nice chat

30:31.539 --> 30:34.030
with a young reporter named Veena Patel.

30:34.065 --> 30:35.849
And you are going to tell her

30:35.884 --> 30:37.304
everything there is to know

30:37.339 --> 30:38.545
about The Courtenay.

30:38.832 --> 30:41.150
It's never gonna happen. Excuse me.

30:41.185 --> 30:42.449
Really?

30:42.919 --> 30:46.609
Well, I guess I could call
those Russian mobsters.

30:46.645 --> 30:49.658
I'm sure Vlad and Ivan would love

30:49.693 --> 30:51.125
to meet the girl who threatened

30:51.161 --> 30:52.655
to expose their entire operation.

30:54.989 --> 30:56.070
Oh, hey.

30:56.409 --> 30:57.832
I think it's for you.

31:07.872 --> 31:09.486
I don't think she likes that crate.

31:09.907 --> 31:11.895
Maybe we should bring her into
our room, just for one night.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.175
Theo, no.

31:13.210 --> 31:15.531
If you go soft, she'll never
learn to sleep on her own.

31:16.404 --> 31:17.933
How will we ever teach our children

31:17.969 --> 31:18.847
to sleep through the night?

31:20.070 --> 31:20.945
I'm fairly certain

31:20.970 --> 31:22.870
my mum left that task to the nanny.

31:23.626 --> 31:24.909
I'm not your mum.

31:25.242 --> 31:26.408
Thank God.

31:33.130 --> 31:34.262
Thank you, Wilson.

31:41.138 --> 31:42.471
What is it, darling?

31:43.189 --> 31:44.307
Darling?

31:45.342 --> 31:47.375
Uh, sorry. Um, nothing.

31:47.690 --> 31:49.444
Nothing, just a-another scandal.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.413
It's appalling how little real news

31:51.448 --> 31:53.215
- the papers cover these days.
- I don't mind reading a scandal.

32:01.473 --> 32:04.441
_

32:21.282 --> 32:22.978
Hi.

32:23.013 --> 32:24.179
Sorry I'm late.

32:24.214 --> 32:26.448
- I was getting worried.
- Don't worry, I'm fine.

32:26.483 --> 32:29.217
The story's out now,
about Molly and the club.

32:29.253 --> 32:30.352
They're bound to shut things down now.

32:30.760 --> 32:32.286
Please tell me Gentleman 33

32:32.322 --> 32:33.455
was at the club last night.

32:33.490 --> 32:35.123
He was, but...

32:35.159 --> 32:36.415
But what?

32:37.327 --> 32:39.394
Did something go wrong?
Didn't you get a look at him?

32:41.165 --> 32:42.464
Yeah, I saw his face.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.300
Who is it?

32:50.407 --> 32:52.174
Grace is a wreck, Gutterie.

32:52.209 --> 32:53.849
She thinks she might be
going down for this

32:53.884 --> 32:55.109
and I think she might be right.

32:55.144 --> 32:57.312
James, why don't you sit down?
Have a drink.

32:57.347 --> 32:59.321
I think we should consider our options.

33:00.647 --> 33:01.983
What are you saying?

33:03.320 --> 33:06.021
The evidence against her
is overwhelming.

33:07.391 --> 33:08.983
I think we make a deal.

33:09.426 --> 33:12.394
If Grace pleads voluntary manslaughter,

33:12.429 --> 33:14.329
then she could get out in,
what, ten years?

33:14.364 --> 33:16.231
She's got the whole of her life
left in front of her.

33:16.266 --> 33:17.966
This isn't about Grace.

33:18.001 --> 33:19.449
This is about you.

33:20.170 --> 33:21.336
If this case goes to trial,

33:21.371 --> 33:23.376
the contents of Molly's phone go public.

33:24.007 --> 33:27.075
So do some interesting photos
of you and your Russian friends.

33:27.110 --> 33:29.458
That picture's gone, no thanks to you.

33:30.113 --> 33:31.313
I heard from the Russians.

33:31.621 --> 33:33.215
They have a guy inside Scotland Yard

33:33.250 --> 33:35.150
who saw the photo and deleted it.

33:35.185 --> 33:36.626
He did your job.

33:37.020 --> 33:38.731
But because you left a loose end,

33:38.766 --> 33:40.388
the Russians are nervous.

33:42.392 --> 33:43.863
They think I might give them up

33:43.898 --> 33:45.770
to save Grace if this goes to trial.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.017
Well, I guess they don't
know you that well.

33:47.053 --> 33:48.632
You think this is funny?

33:48.657 --> 33:51.099
They will kill me
if you don't shut this down.

33:51.134 --> 33:53.034
And if Grace doesn't take a plea,

33:53.070 --> 33:55.303
then she might end up going away
for the rest of her life.

33:55.339 --> 33:57.272
I'm trying to save us both.

33:57.307 --> 33:58.667
Maybe it's time to take some of that

33:58.703 --> 34:00.308
dirty money you've been squirreling away

34:00.344 --> 34:02.077
and lay low, James.

34:04.124 --> 34:05.890
I'm not letting Grace plead guilty.

34:05.925 --> 34:07.058
I'm the one paying you

34:07.093 --> 34:09.060
and I'm telling you to make a deal.

34:09.094 --> 34:10.194
You keep your money.

34:10.230 --> 34:11.402
I don't need it.

34:11.864 --> 34:13.130
I'll defend her pro bono.

34:13.166 --> 34:14.899
Give me a break, Gutterie.

34:14.934 --> 34:16.033
You're not doing this

34:16.069 --> 34:17.235
out of the goodness of your heart.

34:17.270 --> 34:18.969
This case is a dream for a...

34:19.005 --> 34:20.871
a publicity whore like you.

34:20.907 --> 34:23.206
You're gonna play roulette
with Grace's life

34:23.243 --> 34:25.877
just so that you can stay
in front of the cameras.

34:28.181 --> 34:31.215
Do you think Grace's real father
would hang her out like that?

34:56.042 --> 34:57.875
You think I want to brush my teeth

34:57.911 --> 35:00.111
where you wash your stinky bits?

35:00.146 --> 35:01.846
I'll clean the sink.

35:01.881 --> 35:03.815
Oh. Did you hear that?

35:03.850 --> 35:05.817
She'll clean the sink.

35:05.852 --> 35:08.920
Yeah, you'll clean it with your face.

35:12.959 --> 35:14.683
You whittle that toy yourself, luv?

35:14.718 --> 35:15.927
Stay away from me.

35:15.962 --> 35:17.061
Do her!

35:25.941 --> 35:27.100
Guard!

35:27.135 --> 35:28.306
Crazy bitch.

35:30.781 --> 35:32.043
They stabbed me.

35:35.021 --> 35:37.148
Lockdown! This is a lockdown!

35:37.183 --> 35:39.317
I need assistance, straightaway!

35:44.549 --> 35:45.848
There she is.

35:46.275 --> 35:47.474
Lucky girl.

35:47.509 --> 35:49.242
Missed all of your major organs.

35:50.933 --> 35:54.158
Mm. But you'll be pretty
uncomfortable for quite a while.

35:56.031 --> 35:58.165
I need to fill out an incident
report if you're up for it.

36:00.201 --> 36:01.706
Do you know who did this to you?

36:03.584 --> 36:05.618
No, I... I didn't see her face.

36:08.463 --> 36:11.092
That's right. Never rat.

36:11.127 --> 36:12.465
Quick learner.

36:12.827 --> 36:15.168
You'll be safe here
while you're healing up.

36:22.544 --> 36:26.179
Ah, Molly, you've got too
many photos on her damn phone.

36:26.215 --> 36:28.248
Facial recognition report's
not due back till tomorrow.

36:28.283 --> 36:29.928
I say we give just it a rest

36:29.953 --> 36:31.251
until we see what they come up with.

36:31.286 --> 36:33.026
No, no, no. We're behind already, mate.

36:33.062 --> 36:35.141
Molly Ryan was a bloody call girl

36:35.177 --> 36:36.209
and we didn't have a clue.

36:36.244 --> 36:38.184
Place like The Courtenay,
they don't go advertising.

36:38.219 --> 36:39.492
Come on, please. For me?

36:44.466 --> 36:45.731
Stop, wait. Go back.

36:46.339 --> 36:48.301
Back. Back. Back.

36:48.337 --> 36:50.205
There. That woman, there, with Molly.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.271
She look familiar to you?

36:51.306 --> 36:52.122
Maybe.

36:54.776 --> 36:56.709
I think I know
where I've seen her before.

36:57.993 --> 36:59.826
All right, come on...

36:59.874 --> 37:01.641
Come on, come on, come on.

37:01.682 --> 37:03.515
I know I've seen your face.

37:06.255 --> 37:08.188
That's right, she's a missing person.

37:08.223 --> 37:10.890
Jessica Marshall. 46.

37:10.925 --> 37:12.225
Married, two children.

37:12.261 --> 37:14.004
VP at Lloyds of London.

37:14.040 --> 37:17.606
Last seen leaving work
on November 17 last year.

37:17.641 --> 37:18.841
Missing. Presumed dead.

37:18.876 --> 37:21.650
What is a missing insurance exec
doing on Molly Ryan's phone?

37:21.686 --> 37:23.220
Maybe there's a Courtenay connection?

37:23.256 --> 37:24.237
Well, she's no call girl.

37:24.273 --> 37:25.571
Too long in the tooth for that.

37:26.375 --> 37:27.599
Maybe she's a client.

37:27.635 --> 37:30.310
If so, that's two women
connected with that club

37:30.849 --> 37:32.445
who met with foul play.

37:53.597 --> 37:55.335
Neville, do you remember me?

37:57.171 --> 37:58.647
I'm Natalie Atwood.

37:59.308 --> 38:00.573
Grace's sister.

38:03.504 --> 38:04.703
Why are you here?

38:06.504 --> 38:08.315
I don't want to upset you,

38:08.768 --> 38:11.216
but I need to talk to you
about something very important.

38:11.253 --> 38:12.385
Is that okay?

38:19.511 --> 38:22.190
I know you watched Molly sometimes.

38:23.265 --> 38:24.463
And I wondered...

38:26.662 --> 38:27.655
Neville...

38:29.005 --> 38:30.502
did you want to

38:30.718 --> 38:32.504
hurt Grace because...

38:34.176 --> 38:35.851
...because you saw her kill Molly?

38:37.213 --> 38:38.244
No!

38:38.806 --> 38:40.347
Grace didn't kill Molly.

38:40.942 --> 38:41.837
I know she didn't.

38:41.873 --> 38:43.616
How-how do you know
that she didn't do it?

38:46.627 --> 38:48.594
Did you see someone else, Neville?

38:50.911 --> 38:53.226
I'm not allowed to tell.

38:53.261 --> 38:56.563
Mum says I'm not allowed to tell.

38:57.084 --> 38:59.164
The police think Grace did this.

38:59.201 --> 39:00.522
They arrested her. If...

39:01.336 --> 39:03.145
if you know anything
that will clear her name,

39:03.181 --> 39:04.170
you have to help her.

39:04.778 --> 39:05.923
They won't believe me.

39:05.958 --> 39:07.273
They'll just say I'm crazy.

39:07.309 --> 39:08.408
I'll believe you.

39:10.379 --> 39:12.178
I don't think you're crazy.

39:12.214 --> 39:14.180
I just think you loved Molly.

39:15.250 --> 39:16.516
That's right.

39:16.839 --> 39:18.351
And you couldn't help Molly that night,

39:18.387 --> 39:20.151
but you can help her now.

39:21.401 --> 39:22.675
Help her get justice.

39:27.508 --> 39:28.707
I saw him.

39:30.532 --> 39:32.465
He was standing over her,

39:32.959 --> 39:34.784
holding a bloody knife.

39:35.437 --> 39:37.583
And then he just...

39:38.206 --> 39:42.242
he just... threw it down
and left her there,

39:42.277 --> 39:43.752
like she was nothing.

39:44.579 --> 39:46.992
And then he... he just

39:47.416 --> 39:49.881
goes in his car and drives off.

39:53.655 --> 39:55.075
Who, Neville?

39:56.509 --> 39:57.356
Who was it?

39:59.480 --> 40:00.646
Prince Theo.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.541
Prince Theo killed Molly.

40:35.464 --> 40:36.850
Covering your tracks?

40:38.378 --> 40:39.265
Covering yours.

40:42.210 --> 40:43.670
After the article in <i> The Story,</i>

40:43.705 --> 40:45.438
I'm guessing
the coppers'll find this place

40:45.474 --> 40:46.606
before the end of the day.

40:46.641 --> 40:48.170
Just like they found me.

40:49.092 --> 40:50.343
That was your handiwork, wasn't it?

40:50.378 --> 40:51.511
I don't know what you're talking about.

40:51.546 --> 40:54.314
- Save it, Rozzie.
- Come on, Finch.

40:54.349 --> 40:55.415
It's me.

40:56.554 --> 40:57.584
Yeah.

40:57.921 --> 40:59.705
It is you, isn't it?

41:00.288 --> 41:02.898
Seems like you're awfully close
to all my troubles.

41:03.625 --> 41:06.292
Your girlie let that Irish bloke
steal my ledger.

41:06.328 --> 41:09.657
Your roommate planted
Molly's phone in my car.

41:10.198 --> 41:11.409
And now this...

41:12.334 --> 41:14.945
the one thing I can't fix.

41:17.372 --> 41:19.405
- You exposed The Courtenay.
- Finch, I swear.

41:19.441 --> 41:21.611
I swear. It wasn't me. Please...
