WEBVTT

00:21.213 --> 00:22.939
It's the last day
for closing arguments

00:23.065 --> 00:24.733
in the murder trial
of Stephen Rowe.

00:24.859 --> 00:27.979
Accused in the disappearance
and murder of his wife, Melissa,

00:28.321 --> 00:30.447
whose body has
never been found.

00:31.585 --> 00:34.415
No body doesn't mean no crime.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.972
Melissa hasn't used
her credit cards

00:37.183 --> 00:39.580
or withdrawn money
from any of her bank accounts

00:39.801 --> 00:42.948
or even contacted her father
in over six months.

00:43.195 --> 00:45.437
Clearly, we have cessation of life.

00:53.797 --> 00:56.780
I have a title for Ms. West's
case against Stephen :

00:57.381 --> 00:59.660
"Evidence of things not seen."

01:00.546 --> 01:02.046
'Cause I don't see anything.

01:03.686 --> 01:06.399
A gift from her father
when she began culinary school.

01:07.384 --> 01:08.605
It's part of a set.

01:08.898 --> 01:10.712
That's why Mr. Rowe
had to put it back.

01:11.223 --> 01:12.390
Unfortunately for him,

01:13.388 --> 01:14.744
he didn't put all of it back.

01:15.737 --> 01:17.503
The tip broken off
when he stabbed her.

01:21.513 --> 01:23.241
The marriage was unhappy.

01:23.957 --> 01:25.989
And, yes, Stephen
was having an affair.

01:26.658 --> 01:29.723
He met Allison Grady
and found true love.

01:30.310 --> 01:31.496
No crime in that.

01:32.505 --> 01:33.468
But ask yourselves :

01:33.668 --> 01:36.865
Why kill your wife
when divorce is an option ?

01:36.991 --> 01:39.060
Divorce was never an option
for Mr. Rowe.

01:39.186 --> 01:40.572
That would make him the bad guy.

01:41.088 --> 01:42.967
And for a man
who refuses to hold a job,

01:43.272 --> 01:44.923
alimony would be fatal.

01:45.104 --> 01:47.019
It would be much easier
to slice your wife up

01:47.145 --> 01:49.082
and throw her remains
into the ocean.

01:53.392 --> 01:55.975
Melissa Rowe
was missing three days--

01:57.514 --> 01:59.956
three before he called the police.

02:11.784 --> 02:15.239
Finally, consider the four
20-pound dumbbells

02:15.365 --> 02:18.629
curiously missing
from Mr. Rowe's personal set.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.230
No body doesn't mean no crime.

02:21.652 --> 02:22.662
No body...

02:23.197 --> 02:25.310
means Mr. Rowe
had enough weight.

02:31.805 --> 02:33.919
When you go behind those doors,

02:34.424 --> 02:36.490
there's only one question
you need to ask :

02:37.441 --> 02:39.653
do you want to send
a young man to death row

02:39.964 --> 02:42.277
based on things not seen ?

02:45.262 --> 02:47.046
Your Honnor, the jury has a verdict.

02:49.733 --> 02:50.954
Jury Foreman,

02:52.140 --> 02:54.127
has the jury reached
a unanimous decision

02:54.253 --> 02:55.724
on the issue
that was submitted to you ?

02:55.850 --> 02:56.645
Yes, Your Honor.

02:57.279 --> 02:59.345
If you'll give the verdict
to the deputy, please.

03:04.758 --> 03:06.517
If the defendant would please stand.

03:16.123 --> 03:18.682
In The State of Florida
vs. Stephen Rowe,

03:19.551 --> 03:22.604
on the charge of murder in the
first degree of Melissa Rowe...

03:26.444 --> 03:27.970
we find the defendant...

03:33.205 --> 03:34.370
not guilty.

03:35.098 --> 03:38.010
Congratulation.

03:49.132 --> 03:50.118
All right.

03:51.856 --> 03:52.643
Horatio.

03:53.329 --> 03:55.877
Looks like a fisherman
just found Melissa Rowe's body.

03:58.915 --> 04:00.195
The bad news is,

04:00.359 --> 04:01.266
the verdict's already in.

04:01.392 --> 04:02.884
The verdict is in, Frank,

04:03.800 --> 04:05.465
but the jury is out.

05:01.878 --> 05:04.596
Just hour after that Stephen Rowe is disculped for the murder of his wife,

05:04.722 --> 05:10.195
a body believed to be Melissa Rowewas was found by a fisherman.

05:11.628 --> 05:12.473
Is that her, Alexx ?

05:13.342 --> 05:15.796
She was in the water
a long time, Horatio.

05:18.660 --> 05:22.265
It'll be hard to determine
what was degradation from injury.

05:23.674 --> 05:26.327
I'll call you from the office
when I confirm her ID.

05:26.453 --> 05:27.721
No, need, Alexx.

05:27.932 --> 05:29.905
That's Melissa's favorite dress.

05:32.449 --> 05:34.012
Let get her to Autopsy.

05:37.234 --> 05:38.998
Eric. Did you get
anything in the water ?

05:39.124 --> 05:41.317
No. No weights.
She was drifting free.

05:41.568 --> 05:43.545
Okay. It won't be far
from where you found her.

05:43.671 --> 05:44.895
Won't stop looking till I find them.

05:45.021 --> 05:45.621
All right.

05:48.837 --> 05:49.628
Officer.

05:50.438 --> 05:51.229
Let him go.

05:56.102 --> 05:57.125
Mr. Bowman.

05:57.288 --> 05:59.710
- Mr. Bowman, I...
- No, it is- is it my daughter ?

05:59.835 --> 06:02.339
We have to confirm the DNA, but I...

06:02.706 --> 06:04.230
I think it's Melissa.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.351
Mr. Bowman.

06:06.477 --> 06:07.702
You have to let me see her.
Mr. Bowman.

06:07.828 --> 06:10.555
No, I... I need to know.

06:10.862 --> 06:13.911
- I gotta know.
- Mr. Bowman, listen to me.

06:14.065 --> 06:16.708
I want you to stay here with me.

06:17.113 --> 06:18.508
Mr. Bowman.

06:21.518 --> 06:22.984
Stay here with me.

06:23.119 --> 06:24.354
We need to go, boys.

06:24.856 --> 06:27.036
What do I do now,
Lieutenant ?

06:27.537 --> 06:29.421
Let's remember Melissa

06:30.114 --> 06:31.358
the way she was.

06:32.685 --> 06:33.484
All right ?

06:37.691 --> 06:38.501
Let's do that.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.726
Oh, my gosh, why is it
so cold in here ?

06:53.852 --> 06:56.271
I don't want to lose
what little of her I've got.

06:56.733 --> 06:58.222
When you pull a body
out of the water,

06:58.348 --> 07:00.288
putrefaction
goes into overdrive.

07:00.414 --> 07:03.033
Well, tell me you at least
have enough for cause of death.

07:03.244 --> 07:04.237
Don't know yet.

07:04.742 --> 07:07.595
What  I can tell you is,
her fingers were cut off.

07:08.147 --> 07:09.207
Are you sure it
wasn't the wildlife ?

07:09.333 --> 07:13.008
No. They only go for
the meaty parts the lips, ears.

07:13.137 --> 07:16.609
The fish finished the job,
but someone got them started.

07:16.804 --> 07:19.070
I'm hoping her legs
can tell us something.

07:19.516 --> 07:22.158
Looks like the panty hose
kept everything together.

07:22.710 --> 07:25.349
What woman wears
panty hose in Miami ?

07:26.846 --> 07:30.401
Her husband said she was going
to a club the night she disappeared.

07:30.527 --> 07:31.763
That is exactly my point.

07:31.889 --> 07:34.191
I do not believe one word
that man says.

07:34.317 --> 07:37.346
Maybe  you can find something
once the panty hose dry out.

07:40.044 --> 07:40.874
Adipocere.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.701
I thought that only formed
in fatty tissue.

07:42.827 --> 07:44.964
There's a little bit of fat
everywhere in the body.

07:45.128 --> 07:48.521
Water kills most bacteria
except the ones that digest fat.

07:48.647 --> 07:50.076
They excrete the adipocere.

07:50.202 --> 07:52.166
The soapy material
coats nearby tissue

07:52.292 --> 07:55.005
protecting it from decay,
sometimes for years.

07:55.131 --> 07:58.258
So the panty hose kept the water
from wearing away the adipocere,

07:58.384 --> 08:00.075
and that preserved her thighs.

08:00.216 --> 08:00.816
Yeah.

08:01.090 --> 08:04.146
Sharp force trauma.
Based on the tears in her dress,

08:04.530 --> 08:07.275
poor baby girl has wounds
like these all over her body.

08:07.722 --> 08:10.179
Tissue is too degraded
to compare it to our knife.

08:10.305 --> 08:12.618
Well, I know that
this sounds terrible,

08:12.970 --> 08:14.626
but let's hope
he cut her to the bone.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.674
How's it going with the toolmarks
from the Rowe case ?

09:16.850 --> 09:20.000
I'm comparing the stria
from a cast of Melissa's femur

09:20.126 --> 09:22.396
to a test mark of the knife
from the trial.

09:26.906 --> 09:29.421
I see you went virtual
with the Micro-CT.

09:36.329 --> 09:37.374
It's the murder weapon.

09:37.785 --> 09:41.084
That knife made the indentation
on Melissa's femur three times.

09:41.659 --> 09:42.930
Even with the broken tip ?

09:43.056 --> 09:45.003
The tip must've broken off
before the attack.

09:45.129 --> 09:47.595
Why  would Rowe use
a broken knife for the murder ?

09:48.147 --> 09:49.371
So what does this get us ?

09:49.497 --> 09:51.496
Double jeopardy-- even
with the new evidence,

09:51.622 --> 09:53.736
we can't retry
for the same case.

09:54.005 --> 09:56.471
Whose idea was it to go
to trial without a body ?

09:56.799 --> 09:58.975
The state attorney thought
the case was solid enough.

09:59.101 --> 10:01.344
Rowe didn't waive the time,
so we didn't have the time.

10:38.767 --> 10:41.754
Those the missing dumbbells Rowe
used to weigh Melissa's body down ?

10:42.071 --> 10:44.446
Look, if you don't move, I'm gonna
have you arrested for obstruction.

10:44.572 --> 10:45.864
Simple yes or no.

10:46.651 --> 10:48.320
Look, I'm not Ryan, Erica, okay ?

10:48.446 --> 10:50.306
I'm not gonna talk to you
about the Rowe case.

10:52.416 --> 10:53.549
You just did.

11:00.092 --> 11:00.950
Lieutenant Caine.

11:01.384 --> 11:02.808
Hope you're here
to return my stuff.

11:02.934 --> 11:04.425
Sure would like
my laptop back.

11:05.109 --> 11:06.438
Got quite a spread here.

11:06.564 --> 11:08.267
This is my family's house,
Lieutenant.

11:08.393 --> 11:09.532
Is that a fact ?

11:10.207 --> 11:12.259
Did you buy that rock
on your finger yourself, too ?

11:12.385 --> 11:13.465
I'm paying her back.

11:13.817 --> 11:15.614
With your dead wife's policy.

11:15.766 --> 11:16.685
Were you just in the neighborhood,

11:16.811 --> 11:18.177
thought you'd stop by
for a little police harassment ?

11:18.303 --> 11:20.067
No, actually, we've
recovered the weights

11:20.193 --> 11:22.596
that you used to sink Melissa with.

11:24.649 --> 11:25.836
A jury found him innocent.

11:25.962 --> 11:29.554
Never confuse an aquittal
with innocence.

11:29.778 --> 11:30.967
Just leave us alone.

11:31.093 --> 11:34.865
The press hounds us,
you cops drive by every night.

11:34.991 --> 11:36.303
We just want to get on
with our lives.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.536
So did Melissa.

11:37.662 --> 11:38.637
You know what, Caine ?

11:39.457 --> 11:41.644
You shouldn't believe everything
you read in the press.

11:42.966 --> 11:45.244
Everyone's got Melissa
with a halo on her head.

11:47.687 --> 11:49.730
But she wasn't
who you thought she was.

11:50.501 --> 11:51.958
Is that why you killed her ?

11:53.683 --> 11:56.419
I didn't kill Melissa.

11:57.394 --> 11:58.745
Now, get off my property.

12:05.990 --> 12:09.193
So Horatio said something
to Rowe, got him all worked up.

12:09.286 --> 12:11.097
His lawyer wants
all the evidence back.

12:11.223 --> 12:14.534
I liked your Erica Sikes exclusive
about finding Rowe's weights.

12:15.532 --> 12:18.123
I didn't say any of that to her.
She made it all up.

12:18.249 --> 12:19.704
Oh, where have I heard that before ?

12:20.550 --> 12:21.821
Oh, that's right,
I said the same thing.

12:21.947 --> 12:23.148
Give it a rest, Wolfe.

12:23.274 --> 12:25.010
Equal time, bro,
equal time.

12:25.136 --> 12:25.736
Yeah.

12:25.696 --> 12:28.471
Look, you're supposed to be going
through the files on Rowe's laptop.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.447
Didn't bother.
It's already documented.

12:30.573 --> 12:32.964
That's how we found out
Rowe was having an affair.

12:33.090 --> 12:33.793
Horatio wanted you to review...

12:33.919 --> 12:37.008
What I did do was go through
the files that weren't in the laptop.

12:38.170 --> 12:39.218
I'm not following you.

12:39.344 --> 12:42.334
Just 'cause you hit delete
doesn't mean the file's gone.

12:42.827 --> 12:44.224
It's still on your hard-drive.

12:52.582 --> 12:56.316
The space is relabeled as available,
but the file's still there.

12:58.142 --> 13:00.857
Sometimes, it takes a long time
for things to save over it.

13:02.618 --> 13:04.203
That's how I found these.

13:06.810 --> 13:07.752
Looks like he was nervous

13:07.878 --> 13:10.163
we'd find his white sheet
with the pointy hat.

13:11.474 --> 13:13.171
Rowe was a white supremacist ?

13:13.294 --> 13:16.030
While he clearly didn't embrace
our African brethren,

13:16.156 --> 13:18.375
I think his interests
were a little more narrow.

13:19.484 --> 13:22.726
Genealogy,
family genetics.

13:23.818 --> 13:24.984
Looks like he was worried about

13:25.110 --> 13:26.759
how his kids were going to turn out.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.679
Definitely wanted white ones.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.858
Then, I guess we just found out
what Melissa's little secret is.

13:32.879 --> 13:35.463
Melissa's mother died
when she was nine months old.

13:35.589 --> 13:37.174
We just never talked about her.

13:37.597 --> 13:41.520
Stephen found out that Melissa's mom
was black after they were married.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.138
They only dated a month,

13:43.584 --> 13:44.820
then eloped to Vegas.

13:44.946 --> 13:47.599
Mr. Bowman, when exactly
did he find out ?

13:48.400 --> 13:49.339
When I met him.

13:49.832 --> 13:51.852
A week after they came back
from the wedding.

13:54.036 --> 13:55.717
How could you lie to me about that ?

13:55.843 --> 13:56.926
I'm sorry, Stephen.

13:57.052 --> 13:59.744
I just don't go telling everyone
I'm half black.

13:59.870 --> 14:01.318
Oh, yeah, well, I wouldn't either.

14:01.444 --> 14:03.041
It's not like that.

14:03.945 --> 14:04.828
Why does it matter ?

14:04.954 --> 14:05.566
Why does it matter ?

14:05.692 --> 14:07.306
What are our kids
going to look like ?

14:08.598 --> 14:09.537
I don't know.

14:10.063 --> 14:11.084
Like me.

14:11.777 --> 14:13.715
What ? A half-breed ?

14:15.758 --> 14:16.415
Damn it !

14:21.365 --> 14:24.080
That bastard belongs in jail.

14:24.206 --> 14:25.193
You know what ?

14:25.533 --> 14:26.977
I've got an idea.

14:38.191 --> 14:39.133
Lieutenant Caine.

14:39.259 --> 14:39.963
Miss West.

14:40.089 --> 14:41.883
You went over my head and
brought in a federal prosecutor ?

14:42.009 --> 14:43.151
Miss West, I have evidence

14:43.277 --> 14:45.358
that Mr. Rowe was involved
in Melissa's murder,

14:45.484 --> 14:47.230
but  I need to act on it right now.

14:47.825 --> 14:48.438
On what grounds ?

14:48.564 --> 14:51.101
I believe her killing
was racially motivated.

14:51.805 --> 14:52.881
A hate crime ?

14:53.714 --> 14:55.068
You're never going
to sell that to a jury.

14:55.194 --> 14:56.080
- I don't agree.
- Lieutenant.

14:56.206 --> 14:58.213
- Yes, sir ?
- Good work.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.864
I see where
you're going with this,

15:00.990 --> 15:02.358
but Rowe was married
to the victim.

15:02.486 --> 15:05.248
Yes, but he didn't know her racial
status till after they were married.

15:05.374 --> 15:07.418
Okay, Lieutenant,
you want to pursue this,

15:07.567 --> 15:09.029
get me something definitive.

15:09.364 --> 15:10.819
We need a slam dunk.

15:12.108 --> 15:13.068
Thank you.

15:14.486 --> 15:15.772
This is a waste of time.

15:16.269 --> 15:17.828
Bring us cases we can win.

15:28.680 --> 15:29.454
Horatio.

15:29.651 --> 15:30.608
Yes, ma'am ?

15:31.801 --> 15:34.689
For a perfect murder, there's
a lot that doesn't make sense.

15:34.815 --> 15:35.775
I'm listening.

15:36.420 --> 15:38.167
Why use a broken knife
to kill someone ?

15:38.486 --> 15:40.830
Question is,
where is the other piece ?

15:40.956 --> 15:42.793
And I could ask the same question
about the weights.

15:42.919 --> 15:45.752
Delko only recovered two of
the four missing from Rowe's set.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.752
It's like there's a piece
of the crime missing.

15:47.878 --> 15:50.432
So is Stephen hiding
another murder ?

15:50.558 --> 15:52.584
Are you thinking that he used
the same knife and weights

15:52.710 --> 15:53.806
to kill someone else before ?

15:53.932 --> 15:56.316
And was he practicing for Melissa ?

15:58.031 --> 15:58.864
Practice makes perfect.

15:58.990 --> 16:00.833
Yes, it does.
We have our killer.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.508
We need to find our victim.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.718
Mr. Wolfe.

16:12.671 --> 16:13.732
This is impossible.

16:15.081 --> 16:17.820
How do you find Mr. Rowe's first victim
when you know nothing about her ?

16:17.946 --> 16:20.133
I  want to stay focused on Mr. Rowe.

16:20.976 --> 16:21.775
Okay.

16:22.171 --> 16:24.750
Stephen Rowe discovered
Melissa's racial status

16:24.928 --> 16:26.327
on March 26th.

16:27.851 --> 16:29.704
And she disappeared
on October 5th.

16:29.908 --> 16:31.680
So those are the six months
we need to look at.

16:31.806 --> 16:34.561
- That's right.
- So we got to find where he worked,

16:35.162 --> 16:36.980
where he lived, where he ate sushi.

16:37.106 --> 16:38.176
ASAP.

16:40.990 --> 16:42.643
Are you finished with the vics ?

16:43.493 --> 16:44.348
Yeah.

16:45.781 --> 16:47.754
So the stars are all
the female victims

16:47.880 --> 16:50.412
in the area during the six months
we're worried about.

16:50.647 --> 16:53.384
And this database is
the entire life of Stephen Rowe

16:53.510 --> 16:56.293
that you've compiled from six months
of credit card receipts ?

16:56.550 --> 16:57.423
Yeah.

16:58.043 --> 16:59.912
Okay, let's see
where they intersect.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.319
The dots indicate
all the events in Rowe's life.

17:06.444 --> 17:08.548
And when they overlap with a star,

17:08.808 --> 17:11.171
that means that Rowe might have
a relationship with the female victim.

17:11.297 --> 17:14.642
Especially if the victim's murder
looks a lot like Melissa's.

17:14.829 --> 17:16.464
That one's near his old address.

17:22.111 --> 17:23.425
Debra Massey.

17:23.906 --> 17:25.616
Missing since May 15th.

17:26.661 --> 17:27.750
Water dump.

17:37.530 --> 17:41.333
Yeah, the body surfaced only a couple
days later, and the C.O.D. was...

17:41.774 --> 17:43.055
sharp force trauma.

17:43.181 --> 17:44.766
That's only two months
after Rowe discovered

17:44.892 --> 17:46.327
that Melissa's mother was black.

17:46.545 --> 17:48.273
Pull up the status of that case.

17:52.771 --> 17:54.513
Ryan, this case is pending.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.852
Opa-Locka P.D. has arrested
one Ethan Gaffney. He's in custody.

17:59.925 --> 18:01.626
The murder looks an awful
lot like Melissa's.

18:01.752 --> 18:03.657
Maybe Opa-Locka has the wrong guy.

18:08.536 --> 18:09.782
Debra Massey was my student.

18:09.908 --> 18:10.759
Your student ?

18:10.885 --> 18:12.265
Yeah, I'm a pilot.

18:13.043 --> 18:14.254
I give flying lessons.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.304
Mr. Gaffney, do you know
a Stephen Rowe ?

18:17.898 --> 18:19.354
Yeah, yeah, from the news.

18:20.639 --> 18:21.944
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:22.255 --> 18:24.274
You trying to pin
the Rowe murder on me ?

18:24.428 --> 18:26.532
What, he walks on his wife's murder,
so now you go looking

18:26.658 --> 18:27.994
for a sacrificial lamb ? Is that it ?

18:28.120 --> 18:31.270
We're trying to determine if there's
a connection between the two cases.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.018
Wait a minute.

18:33.985 --> 18:35.197
Damn, I get it.

18:35.488 --> 18:37.175
You think he killed
the lady I'm in for.

18:37.301 --> 18:39.467
Just relax. We're just
asking questions here.

18:39.599 --> 18:40.848
But that makes sense.

18:41.039 --> 18:42.838
See, I had nothing to do
with Debra's death.

18:42.964 --> 18:44.576
I'm as innocent as the day is long.

18:44.711 --> 18:47.314
Opa-Locka P.D. must have had
some reason to arrest you.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.827
Yeah, I have the luck of being
the last to see her alive.

18:50.053 --> 18:52.457
I told them, flying lesson was over,
she went home.

18:52.583 --> 18:53.700
They didn't believe me.

18:53.899 --> 18:56.736
Well, Mr. Gaffney, we'll look for
some evidence we all can believe.

18:57.065 --> 18:57.825
Let's go.

19:02.834 --> 19:05.141
Debra was stabbed,
but they never found the knife.

19:06.239 --> 19:08.151
Maybe because Stephen Rowe
had it all the time.

19:08.277 --> 19:09.734
Only tool marks will tell.

19:09.860 --> 19:12.727
They didn't say anything about
the bones in the autopsy findings.

19:12.953 --> 19:14.230
Probably didn't look.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.453
Then I think we need to.

19:26.649 --> 19:28.697
If she was in the water, too,
how come she looks so much

19:28.823 --> 19:30.258
better than Stephen Rowe's wife ?

19:30.384 --> 19:32.431
You know, she was only
in the water a couple of days

19:32.557 --> 19:34.321
before the gases brought her up.

19:34.495 --> 19:36.657
Until she was buried,
she was on ice,

19:36.783 --> 19:39.111
which makes my job
a whole lot easier.

19:41.429 --> 19:43.570
Debra's not missing any fingers.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.240
That's not like Melissa.

19:45.372 --> 19:47.180
Yeah, but like Melissa,

19:47.753 --> 19:48.983
Debra was stabbed.

19:49.109 --> 19:50.809
She was also weighted down.

19:50.988 --> 19:53.006
You think this is
Rowe's practice murder ?

19:53.509 --> 19:55.734
Those are ligature marks
around her ankles.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.448
Can't tell from what.

19:57.702 --> 20:00.466
If I can get a clear image,
I'll let Horatio know.

20:00.733 --> 20:01.776
Okay.

20:02.508 --> 20:05.985
Tool marks on Debra's bones were from
narrower blade than Melissa's were,

20:06.111 --> 20:08.399
and they were
more slashes than stabs.

20:08.525 --> 20:10.862
So this is not the blade
with the broken tip.

20:11.068 --> 20:15.772
No. Debra's edge was more flat,
hollow grind, like a box cutter.

20:15.979 --> 20:17.302
Melissa was a tapered knife.

20:17.612 --> 20:21.862
And that means that Debra and Melissa
were killed by different knives.

20:22.059 --> 20:23.909
Both were weighted down
and dumped in a lake.

20:24.035 --> 20:25.731
Debra floated up,
but Melissa stayed put.

20:25.857 --> 20:29.289
Yes, so someone is learning
from their mistakes. Alexx.

20:29.665 --> 20:32.160
But was it Rowe
making those mistakes, Horatio.

20:32.649 --> 20:36.621
Whatever was used to tie Debra Massey
down left a unique mark in the skin.

20:36.747 --> 20:40.345
Now, I couldn't make it out at first,
until I used oblique lighting.

20:46.470 --> 20:48.217
A timing chain made that mark.

20:48.446 --> 20:50.001
It's used in airplane engines.

20:50.127 --> 20:53.815
Ladies, I believe we have a suspect
who can enlighten us.

20:54.476 --> 20:58.172
You gave Debra Massey flying
lessons. You work with airplanes.

20:58.792 --> 21:01.130
Do you recognize the chain,
Mr. Gaffney ?

21:01.256 --> 21:05.287
It's unique. It's found in motorcycles,
snowmobiles and your airplane.

21:07.249 --> 21:08.597
It's called a silent chain.

21:08.723 --> 21:10.348
Well, it's talking now, isn't it ?

21:11.781 --> 21:14.880
You used this chain to tie weights
to Debra Massey's ankles.

21:26.028 --> 21:30.058
Mr. Gaffney, you killed Debra. This
is your chance to help yourself.

21:34.302 --> 21:35.579
Okay, look...

21:37.240 --> 21:38.485
I  need you to understand something,

21:38.611 --> 21:40.899
'cause those Opa-Locka detectives
won't listen to me.

21:41.380 --> 21:44.001
I didn't set out to kill Debra.
She was hitting on me.

21:44.163 --> 21:45.856
When she freaked out,
I overreacted.

21:46.295 --> 21:48.232
- Come on...
- Just... No !

21:49.360 --> 21:52.093
Hey, come on, let finish
your flying lesson.

21:55.301 --> 21:56.146
Shut up.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.321
She wouldn't stop screaming.

22:03.481 --> 22:04.709
People were going to hear.

22:05.048 --> 22:06.241
I had to shut her up.

22:06.696 --> 22:09.729
Hey, for the record, I didn't have
anything to do with that Rowe chick.

22:09.935 --> 22:11.663
I just don't want
those papers to start

22:11.841 --> 22:12.956
printing those lies again.

22:13.082 --> 22:13.791
What lies ?

22:13.917 --> 22:15.877
They made me out to be
some kind of Hannibal Lecter,

22:16.003 --> 22:18.891
said I cut off her fingers and ate them.
I didn't do that. I'm not a monster.

22:19.017 --> 22:21.241
I don't think Debra
would agree with that.

22:25.339 --> 22:26.087
Eric,

22:26.256 --> 22:30.040
the articles from Debra Massey's
murder, go back through them.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.768
So, what do you think
this article's about ?

22:36.660 --> 22:38.379
"Victim's name withheld."

22:38.947 --> 22:41.051
These look like
Melissa Rowe's murder.

22:41.450 --> 22:44.825
Yeah, I thought so, too.
Everything reads like Melissa,

22:45.279 --> 22:46.735
but her fingers are cut off.

22:48.491 --> 22:50.219
This is Debra Massey's murder.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.497
This is before
Gaffney was arrested.

22:52.713 --> 22:55.157
Yeah. Describes the murder
as being "perfect,"

22:55.608 --> 22:58.030
only they misreported
that her fingers had been removed.

22:58.156 --> 23:00.550
So Rowe read everything he could
about Debra Massey,

23:00.888 --> 23:02.803
copied it to the letter with Melissa

23:03.037 --> 23:04.930
to make the police think
Gaffney did it.

23:05.056 --> 23:06.817
But he practiced on someone else first,

23:06.943 --> 23:08.925
and they'll also be
missing their fingers.

23:09.184 --> 23:11.734
Okay, so we need to find a body
without any fingers.

23:12.209 --> 23:12.968
Problem.

23:13.607 --> 23:15.380
None of the unsolveds
have missing digits.

23:15.506 --> 23:18.119
I'm going to talk to someone who
knows Rowe better than anyone else.

23:18.245 --> 23:19.953
- Who's that ?
- His old roommate.

23:33.134 --> 23:34.017
Damon Sloane ?

23:34.143 --> 23:36.124
You used to be
Stephen Rowe's roommate ?

23:37.225 --> 23:38.127
Man...

23:38.390 --> 23:39.798
you guys never give up.

23:40.548 --> 23:42.059
Read the trial transcripts.

23:42.322 --> 23:43.898
I don't got any new answers for you.

23:44.049 --> 23:45.714
Well, I think we have
different questions.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.252
So, you said that after
Stephen got married,

23:47.378 --> 23:48.658
he still came to your poker games ?

23:48.784 --> 23:50.408
Yeah. I already answered that one.

23:50.534 --> 23:52.121
Did Melissa ever come with him ?

23:52.278 --> 23:53.564
She came for a while,

23:54.165 --> 23:55.292
but then they both stopped.

23:55.461 --> 23:56.475
Why, do you think ?

23:57.727 --> 23:59.933
This is why Stevie
could never hurt a woman.

24:00.104 --> 24:01.339
He likes them too much.

24:01.610 --> 24:03.610
Did Melissa catch him
with another woman ?

24:05.175 --> 24:06.321
Not at the game.

24:07.155 --> 24:10.201
He was talking to another
tenant here. Melissa overreacted.

24:18.222 --> 24:19.604
Does this woman still live here ?

24:19.730 --> 24:23.436
Now, you see, if I answer that one, I know
what you'll be thinking, and you'll be wrong.

24:24.292 --> 24:26.846
What would be wrong is
you not answering the question.

24:30.039 --> 24:31.757
Her name is Theresa Barton.

24:33.045 --> 24:36.129
She moved out, left all her stuff,
didn't tell anyone.

24:36.607 --> 24:39.706
Sounds a lot like Theresa Barton
went missing. Anyone call it in ?

24:39.832 --> 24:40.620
I don't know.

24:40.746 --> 24:44.314
The manager may have, but people
come and go around here all the time.

24:44.963 --> 24:48.195
He gave her a month. No calls.
He put her stuff in storage.

24:49.410 --> 24:51.560
Stevie had nothing to do
with this Barton chick.

24:51.877 --> 24:53.699
I think we're going
to answer that one.

24:58.802 --> 25:01.177
Want to guess when
Theresa Barton disappeared ?

25:01.947 --> 25:03.007
Inside our timeline ?

25:03.147 --> 25:06.286
Three months after Stephen decided
to get rid of Melissa and

25:06.412 --> 25:09.759
a month after the Massey murder
articles were published.

25:09.903 --> 25:12.677
So, this is all the stuff
from Theresa Barton's storage ?

25:12.869 --> 25:13.825
Yeah.

25:18.022 --> 25:19.328
She's a pretty girl.

25:28.871 --> 25:32.231
Let's have Tripp follow up on this
membership at Carlyle's Cinema Rental.

25:33.050 --> 25:34.552
She has a movie rental card ?

25:34.750 --> 25:35.576
Yeah.

25:38.356 --> 25:39.445
That's weird.

25:42.963 --> 25:45.573
Theresa doesn't have
a DVD player or a VCR.

25:46.458 --> 25:47.350
Let me see this.

25:51.399 --> 25:53.462
You know, the only time I've
ever seen a card look like this...

25:53.588 --> 25:55.287
When it's used
to open a locked door.

25:57.505 --> 25:59.136
I bet if we call Carlyle's,
the account number

25:59.262 --> 26:00.820
will have Stephen Rowe's name on it.

26:00.946 --> 26:02.321
You confirm that,
I'm going to call Horatio

26:02.447 --> 26:04.643
and have him pick up Rowe
at his girlfriend's house.

26:05.978 --> 26:08.260
I think we just found
Rowe's practice murder.

26:16.634 --> 26:17.442
Frank.

26:19.496 --> 26:20.716
That is blood.

26:26.151 --> 26:28.338
Ms. Grady, are you here ?

26:33.242 --> 26:34.322
Mr. Rowe ?!

26:38.541 --> 26:40.175
He's already gone, Frank.

26:41.524 --> 26:44.351
Well, somebody's blood is still here.
Do you think it's Allison's ?

26:44.495 --> 26:46.720
Let's find Mr. Rowe and ask him.

26:57.064 --> 26:59.183
We went to your girlfriend's house
looking for you, Stephen,

26:59.309 --> 27:01.088
but instead we found her blood.

27:01.241 --> 27:03.040
You know, every time something
goes wrong in this town,

27:03.166 --> 27:04.511
you can't come running for me.

27:04.718 --> 27:05.839
Where's Allison ?

27:06.557 --> 27:08.900
Like I told you, last time
I saw her, she was at home.

27:09.026 --> 27:10.676
Yes, which is where you cut her.

27:11.919 --> 27:12.889
That was an accident.

27:13.015 --> 27:13.950
Aren't they all ?

27:14.076 --> 27:14.855
Look !

27:16.112 --> 27:17.304
Allison hit me.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.931
She cut herself
on a broken picture frame.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.925
I tried to go help her. She told me
to leave her alone, so I did.

27:28.051 --> 27:30.574
She's probably off shopping,
trying to cool off right now.

27:31.592 --> 27:33.228
Look, with any absence
of any wrongdoing...

27:33.354 --> 27:35.786
We found out about
Theresa Barton, Stephen.

27:37.612 --> 27:38.628
I don't know a Theresa Barton.

27:38.754 --> 27:41.698
Yes, you do, you used her
as your practice victim.

27:46.502 --> 27:47.693
That's quite a stretch.

27:48.397 --> 27:49.646
You know, you can't just connect me

27:49.772 --> 27:51.459
with some random woman
just'cause you want to.

27:51.585 --> 27:53.767
We recovered your video rental card,

27:53.893 --> 27:56.215
the one you used
to break into her apartment.

28:02.429 --> 28:03.947
You got a body this time, Caine ?

28:04.332 --> 28:05.436
I don't need a body.

28:06.230 --> 28:07.285
Take him, please.

28:11.205 --> 28:14.983
H, that print we lifted
from Allison's blood at her house ?

28:15.218 --> 28:18.223
I matched it to the ten cards
from the Rowe investigation.

28:19.757 --> 28:21.343
Melissa's father.

28:25.693 --> 28:27.699
Are we sure
Allison's in here, Frank ?

28:27.825 --> 28:31.122
We haven't spotted her yet.
Bowman's here. He won't come out.

28:31.702 --> 28:32.519
Okay.

28:33.577 --> 28:34.807
You take the back.

28:36.853 --> 28:38.148
I'll take the front.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.143
Mr. Bowman ?

28:59.114 --> 29:01.124
Mr. Bowman, it's Horatio Caine.

29:02.886 --> 29:04.154
I just want to talk.

29:04.663 --> 29:07.395
<i>Are you okay ? Are you okay ?</i>

29:12.783 --> 29:15.759
There you go, Melissa,
there you go ! Keep pedaling.

29:16.383 --> 29:17.759
Mr. Bowman ?

29:19.482 --> 29:22.264
She kept falling off
that damn bike...

29:23.289 --> 29:25.668
but she always got back on.

29:27.034 --> 29:30.412
No matter how bad it got,
she got back on.

29:30.753 --> 29:32.541
That's why she's dead.

29:33.314 --> 29:34.955
Allison's dead ?

29:35.081 --> 29:36.909
Is that what you're telling me ?

29:40.951 --> 29:42.016
No.

29:43.335 --> 29:44.615
Melissa.

29:47.470 --> 29:49.647
She wouldn't give up on Stephen.

29:51.114 --> 29:53.205
No matter what he did to her.

29:56.192 --> 29:57.989
I didn't save my girl,

29:58.118 --> 29:59.669
but I saved Allison.

29:59.795 --> 30:02.203
And that's a good thing, Mr. Bowman.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.327
It's a good thing.

30:05.029 --> 30:07.373
I didn't go there
to do a good thing.

30:08.051 --> 30:10.062
I went there to kill that bastard.

30:17.717 --> 30:19.387
Did he hurt you ?

30:20.467 --> 30:22.396
We got to get you out of here
before he comes back.

30:22.522 --> 30:23.876
Listen to me, listen to me !

30:24.002 --> 30:27.076
If you don't leave now,
he will kill you.

30:27.981 --> 30:29.847
Please, let go.

30:36.813 --> 30:38.931
She didn't understand
I wanted to help her.

30:39.057 --> 30:40.303
Mr. Bowman,

30:40.689 --> 30:41.825
You kidnapped her.

30:41.950 --> 30:45.131
If I saved her life, do you think I care if I go to prison ?

30:46.368 --> 30:47.576
Where is she ?

30:49.518 --> 30:51.576
She'll just go back to him.

30:58.296 --> 30:59.751
Mr. Bowman...

31:01.928 --> 31:03.518
Going back...

31:04.246 --> 31:06.885
is her choice,
just like Melissa's.

31:07.011 --> 31:08.998
You did not fail them.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.885
I did fail my daughter.

31:18.855 --> 31:20.913
I just want my little girl back.

31:22.976 --> 31:24.300
I know you do.

31:26.632 --> 31:27.763
We found the girl.

31:28.399 --> 31:29.303
Okay, Franck.

31:30.893 --> 31:32.181
Okay.

31:51.253 --> 31:54.225
Thank you, Lieutenant.
He was going to kill me.

31:54.350 --> 31:57.057
Believe it or not, ma'am,
he was trying to help you.

31:58.169 --> 31:59.812
Can I just go home to Stephen ?

31:59.938 --> 32:02.108
Stephen is under arrest.

32:03.623 --> 32:07.708
- Stephen didn't hurt me. It was an accident.
- This has nothing to do with you.

32:08.452 --> 32:10.657
I don't understand.
Why are you holding him ?

32:10.783 --> 32:14.035
Because Stephen,
ma'am, is a killer.

32:14.724 --> 32:16.004
Excuse me.

32:20.989 --> 32:22.825
Horatio, we still haven't found Theresa Barton's body...

32:22.950 --> 32:27.664
Frank, we've got 72 hours before Stephen is released and disappears.

32:33.902 --> 32:34.848
Hey.

32:35.438 --> 32:38.332
What you said earlier about these
Massey articles got me thinking.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.842
You mean how Rowe studied
them for his murders ?

32:41.099 --> 32:43.250
I think you know where
Theresa Barton's body is.

32:43.879 --> 32:44.811
I do ?

32:44.937 --> 32:47.436
Yeah, well, if he followed
these articles to a "T,"

32:47.562 --> 32:49.287
where was Massey's body dumped ?

32:49.413 --> 32:50.593
Silmar Lake.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.223
Then that's where we'll find
Rowe's practice victim.

33:14.050 --> 33:15.896
Things change fast in Miami.

33:22.603 --> 33:24.111
Could I help you, gentlemen ?

33:24.237 --> 33:26.650
Yeah. Yeah, you can.
There used to be a lake here,

33:26.775 --> 33:28.786
and we think there was
a body dumped in it.

33:28.912 --> 33:30.325
Yeah, well, we drained it
a few months ago

33:30.350 --> 33:32.593
and filled it up with trash,
and nobody found no body.

33:32.719 --> 33:35.459
Yeah, well, you wouldn't
if you weren't looking for it,

33:35.585 --> 33:36.571
but we will be.

33:36.697 --> 33:37.978
Not now, you're not.

33:38.104 --> 33:40.671
If I shut down,
I lose ten grand a minute.

33:41.211 --> 33:42.378
well,...

33:42.504 --> 33:46.088
you want to lose another ten arguing about
it, or do you want to let us get to work ?

33:50.496 --> 33:52.670
I get how the thing sees
different layers underground,

33:52.795 --> 33:54.381
but how is it going
to pick up a body ?

33:54.507 --> 33:56.743
It's a landfill,
she's covered in trash.

33:56.869 --> 34:00.121
It's the same way, it kicks out
the electromagnetic waves,

34:00.247 --> 34:01.800
they bounce back,
and the computer

34:01.925 --> 34:04.016
creates a cross-section
of what's below.

34:04.442 --> 34:07.097
- Now, if I see a bump...
- Bump means we got a body.

34:07.223 --> 34:08.993
Right. Wait a minute, stop.

34:09.708 --> 34:11.170
Back up about a foot.

34:27.248 --> 34:28.820
This is where we start digging.

34:34.641 --> 34:35.828
What are we looking at ?

34:37.822 --> 34:40.232
We're looking at
Stephen Rowe behind bars.

34:58.969 --> 35:02.607
It could be Theresa Barton.
I'll learn more at the post.

35:02.732 --> 35:06.257
We can compare her to
a DNA sample of her belongings

35:06.383 --> 35:07.395
Okay.

35:07.959 --> 35:10.196
Okay, her fingers are missing.

35:10.322 --> 35:12.804
One similarity to Melissa Rowe.

35:17.015 --> 35:18.049
Detective Wolfe.

35:19.092 --> 35:20.905
Okay, there's another similarity.

35:21.030 --> 35:23.265
Those are Stephen Rowe's
missing dumbbells.

35:23.391 --> 35:24.231
All right,

35:24.834 --> 35:26.903
all we need now is the knife tip.

36:05.871 --> 36:07.056
It's a match,

36:07.182 --> 36:08.005
Stephen.

36:08.893 --> 36:11.603
So you have the tip of a knife.

36:12.019 --> 36:13.693
This is all déjà vu, Caine.

36:14.763 --> 36:17.235
My lawyer got me off the first time,
he'll get me off again.

36:17.361 --> 36:20.106
Actually, Stephen,
I have quite a bit more

36:20.582 --> 36:22.120
than the tip of a knife.

36:22.246 --> 36:24.330
I have Theresa Barton's body

36:24.767 --> 36:26.265
with the tip of the knife in it.

36:26.391 --> 36:29.852
We found her, buried in
the bottom of a lake bed.

36:29.978 --> 36:32.686
You chose Theresa
randomly, didn't you ?

36:34.333 --> 36:36.606
- Do you live in the building ?
- My old roommate lives here.

36:36.732 --> 36:37.544
Oh, that's great.

36:37.670 --> 36:39.406
I come here to play poker.

37:01.359 --> 37:03.367
The problem is, Stephen,

37:04.259 --> 37:06.000
is that you didn't do your homework.

37:06.126 --> 37:09.266
The press got it wrong.
Debra Massey's fingers were not,

37:09.392 --> 37:11.882
I repeat, not cut off.

37:13.771 --> 37:14.754
You know what, Caine ?

37:19.113 --> 37:20.459
You have my lawyer's number.

37:21.460 --> 37:24.857
Stephen, I don't
even think your lawyer

37:24.983 --> 37:26.986
is going to take this case.

37:35.131 --> 37:38.247
Here are the pantyhose from
the drying shed you asked for.

37:38.373 --> 37:39.277
Thanks, Paula.

37:39.403 --> 37:42.123
Even in that envelope,
it stunk up the whole lab.

37:54.462 --> 37:57.133
Hey, what are you doing ? I thought
Horatio already nailed Stephen Rowe.

37:57.259 --> 38:00.393
He's on ice. But Horatio still wants to
build the federal case for the hate crime.

38:00.519 --> 38:04.105
I was just waiting for these to dry
out to tie up Melissa's loose ends.

38:04.919 --> 38:06.038
What's that ?

38:06.977 --> 38:08.251
It's a fingernail.

38:09.171 --> 38:10.705
Well, that must've hurt.

38:15.958 --> 38:18.391
Lucky some skin was still
attached to your fingernail.

38:18.517 --> 38:20.329
Usually, there's no viable DNA.

38:20.455 --> 38:21.874
Hey, Valera, let me ask you,

38:22.000 --> 38:25.357
If you saw a woman wearing pantyhose
in Miami, what would you think ?

38:25.483 --> 38:26.247
Hooker.

38:26.373 --> 38:27.906
Or from out of town.

38:28.881 --> 38:32.143
My money's on whoever redressed
Melissa is not a Miami native.

38:32.269 --> 38:34.100
I thought this case was closed.

38:37.739 --> 38:40.715
I compared the DNA to the blood
we found at the house.

38:40.841 --> 38:42.135
I never thought...

38:44.290 --> 38:45.981
This case just reopened.

38:50.506 --> 38:52.557
You are not from Miami
originally, are you ?

38:52.683 --> 38:53.719
Connecticut.

38:54.747 --> 38:58.057
My family gave me the house
here, so I moved down.

38:58.183 --> 39:00.229
What does this have
to do with anything ?

39:00.355 --> 39:03.677
It explains why we found
pantyhose on Melissa's body.

39:03.803 --> 39:05.188
Young women from Miami
don't wear them.

39:05.314 --> 39:08.421
Yes, and why you redressed
her for a night out in Connecticut.

39:08.547 --> 39:09.527
What ?

39:10.254 --> 39:13.477
I didn't redress Melissa.
I had nothing do with her.

39:13.603 --> 39:16.982
Then explain the fingernail
that we found in her pantyhose.

39:20.556 --> 39:21.749
Oh, God.

39:26.060 --> 39:27.986
I did redress her.

39:28.876 --> 39:30.204
I didn't want to.

39:30.330 --> 39:32.001
Stephen made me.

39:33.064 --> 39:34.434
That's all I did.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.734
That already makes you
an accessory to murder.

39:36.860 --> 39:39.096
What was I supposed to do ?

39:39.222 --> 39:40.715
I was terrified.

39:40.841 --> 39:43.602
If I said anything,
I would wind up like her.

39:43.728 --> 39:44.958
Now listen to me.

39:45.084 --> 39:47.474
We need to make it look like
Melissa went to the club.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.224
We're going to have to find
some things to add to the dress.

39:50.350 --> 39:53.356
Allison, you did more
than redress her.

39:57.552 --> 39:58.586
Look,

39:58.856 --> 40:00.634
you don't know what really happened.

40:00.760 --> 40:03.188
- No one else was there.
- Stephen was there, Allison.

40:03.314 --> 40:06.898
Stephen is meeting with the
assistant state attorney as we speak.

40:07.080 --> 40:09.444
- I don't understand.
- He's cutting a deal.

40:09.570 --> 40:11.202
- With what ?
- With you.

40:12.963 --> 40:15.540
Oh, my God.

40:16.404 --> 40:19.000
He's such a coward.

40:20.703 --> 40:22.288
He promised me.

40:22.414 --> 40:24.809
He chickened out on
killing Melissa, didn't he ?

40:25.270 --> 40:28.727
The whole point of the other
girl was to get rid of Melissa.

40:28.853 --> 40:31.650
I can't. That girl's face,
I can't get it out of my head.

40:31.776 --> 40:34.031
You promised me we'd be together.

40:34.157 --> 40:35.721
I'll figure something else out.

40:35.847 --> 40:38.897
You mean, you'll leave it to me
to figure something else out.

40:43.025 --> 40:44.990
That's what he never understood.

40:45.804 --> 40:47.638
That there was no other way.

40:47.764 --> 40:50.345
he was not going to stay
married to a black girl,

40:50.471 --> 40:52.707
and Melissa wasn't going
to give him a divorce.

40:52.833 --> 40:55.722
So you took the knife
from the practice murder.

40:55.848 --> 40:57.239
It was easy.

40:57.365 --> 40:58.695
Called her,

40:59.509 --> 41:01.078
told her if she wanted to know

41:01.203 --> 41:03.778
who her husband was
sleeping with to come over.

41:05.617 --> 41:08.856
I'm so sorry you had
to find out this way.

41:09.476 --> 41:12.464
We love each other very much.

41:22.484 --> 41:24.703
I told you that I would
take care of it.

41:26.243 --> 41:28.511
We've got to make it look like
Melissa went to the club.

41:28.637 --> 41:32.313
We got to find something
to add to her dress, okay ?

41:33.339 --> 41:35.112
Sometimes you have to fight
for what you want.

41:35.238 --> 41:36.408
Yes, well...

41:36.534 --> 41:39.433
now, you can fight
for your own life.

41:44.487 --> 41:48.024
Melissa Rowe, Debra Massey,
Theresa Barton-- what are these ?

41:48.150 --> 41:50.825
Ms. West, you asked me to deliver
you a case that you can win.

41:50.950 --> 41:52.102
Now, you have three.

41:53.504 --> 41:54.704
Wow,

41:54.830 --> 41:56.245
a trifecta.

41:56.653 --> 41:59.260
Good job, Lieutenant.
Is that another one ?

42:00.311 --> 42:02.428
This one is for Melissa's father.

42:03.098 --> 42:05.201
I'm hoping it will
bring him some peace.

42:05.998 --> 42:07.042
For the Feds.

42:07.468 --> 42:08.357
Yeah.

42:08.483 --> 42:09.608
How are you going to do that ?

42:09.834 --> 42:10.601
Well,

42:11.062 --> 42:15.180
Allison's testimony makes Melissa's
death Stephen's hate crime.

42:15.306 --> 42:18.051
We already have him for Theresa
Barton. Isn't that overkill ?

42:18.177 --> 42:20.103
Hate doesn't trouble you, Ms. West

42:21.745 --> 42:22.779
Of course, it does.

42:22.905 --> 42:24.282
I'm glad to hear that...

42:25.012 --> 42:26.440
because hate

42:26.966 --> 42:28.495
should trouble us all.
