{\an5}(Joy)
<i>Hot in Cleveland</i> is recorded in
front of a live studio audience.

00:07.340 --> 00:10.593
{\an3}One month from today,
I'm getting married in Paris.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.887
Why are you telling us things
we already know?

00:12.971 --> 00:14.931
Because I love saying it
so much.

00:15.014 --> 00:17.225
And it distracts me from
my little procedure today.

00:17.308 --> 00:20.562
{\an1}Joy's getting
her sixth toe removed.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.230
It's not a toe.

00:22.313 --> 00:24.441
It's a small nub of cartilage
with a half-nail.

00:26.568 --> 00:30.029
I'm gonna miss Joy's
stumpy little claw.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.448
It helped me lose weight
for the Oscars.

00:32.531 --> 00:35.243
Oh, just thinking about it
killed my appetite.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.287
Well, say good-bye.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.955
I need my feet to look perfect

00:39.038 --> 00:40.790
for my dress fitting
this Friday.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.250
Now, hand me that nail polish.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.793
Just because
it's being chopped off

00:43.877 --> 00:45.044
doesn't mean it can't be pretty.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.257
Oh, I'm so happy
for Joy and Bob.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.593
{\an1}I just can't stand the idea
of her moving out.

00:51.676 --> 00:52.969
It's funny.

00:53.052 --> 00:57.182
I spent five years
wishing Joy would be gone.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.975
And now you're sad?

00:59.058 --> 01:02.854
No, I'm just telling
what I've been doing.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.147
Well, I'm sad she's going.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.357
I am gonna miss her like crazy.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.110
{\an1}Me too.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.613
This house is gonna seem
so empty without her.

01:11.696 --> 01:12.614
I know.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.199
Victoria, we can't do this.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.533
I mean, come on.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.452
I mean, when my daughter
went off to college,

01:17.535 --> 01:20.497
I was so sad, I made everybody
ten times more miserable.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.832
We have got to show Joy that
we're gonna be okay without her.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.000
Brave faces from everybody.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.335
Yeah, you're right.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.544
We just need to tamp down
our feelings,

01:26.628 --> 01:28.546
and it'll be good for us too.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.548
No, I don't like dwelling
on sad things.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.635
That's why I got divorced
so many times.

01:33.718 --> 01:34.844
{\an1}Hey, you.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.471
{\an1}You ready to go
to the doctor's office?

01:36.554 --> 01:38.348
{\an1}No, I want to wait until
my mother gets here.

01:38.431 --> 01:41.684
And fair warning; she's
gonna be even meaner than usual.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.561
Her boyfriend Daniel
just broke up with her.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.147
So you sent Bob to the airport
to deal with her?

01:46.231 --> 01:48.191
Well, it was either him or me,
and I didn't want to do it.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.862
Hello, everyone.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.364
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.158
{\an1}Joy, I was telling Philipa
I'm not just gaining a wife,

01:57.242 --> 01:59.202
{\an1}but a beautiful mother-in-law
as well.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.870
Oh, you.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.372
Well, Rejoyla,

02:02.455 --> 02:05.917
your future husband
is not what I was expecting.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.711
He's not drunk or in prison.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.880
Philipa, why don't I take
your bags to your room

02:10.964 --> 02:11.881
so you can freshen up?

02:11.965 --> 02:14.008
Oh, what a gentleman.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.969
Oh, Joy doesn't deserve you.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.389
Wouldn't it have been easier
for your mom

02:19.472 --> 02:20.890
to just join us in Paris
for the wedding?

02:20.974 --> 02:23.226
Yes, but my mother's
never been easy.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.353
{\an3}So you must get it
from your dad.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.029
I am sorry, Joy.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.615
There is nothing worse than a
parent showing up unannounced.

02:37.699 --> 02:38.908
Hello, ladies.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.702
Daddy.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.412
What are you doing here?

02:42.495 --> 02:44.998
Don't you mean,
who is he doing here?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.421
Wait--wait a minute.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.548
{\an1}You mean to say that you
and Elka have been--

02:53.631 --> 02:56.593
{\an1}and you didn't think
to mention this?

02:56.676 --> 02:59.888
We were doing
some unmentionable things.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.015
(Victoria)
Oh, God.

03:02.098 --> 03:05.977
I've also been seducing Elka
with my culinary skills.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.979
Anyone else for Eggs a la Alex?

03:08.062 --> 03:09.439
No, thanks.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.232
Just the thought of you and Elka

03:11.316 --> 03:14.319
has replaced Joy's extra toe
as my appetite suppressant.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.617
Then, my darling,
we shall just feast alone.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.201
- Mwah.
- Oh, I can't wait.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.247
I've gotta dump your dad.

{\an7}Oh, so she won't need
all these painkillers, right?

03:47.393 --> 03:49.687
{\an8}I may need some to deal
with my father.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.482
{\an8}Has Elka gotten around
to breaking up with him yet?

03:52.565 --> 03:53.942
{\an8}Well, she was going to.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.818
{\an8}But then she tasted
his sweet-and-sour meatballs.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.991
{\an9}Oh, can you believe our sweet
little Joy is moving on?

04:02.075 --> 04:03.368

{\an8}No, Victoria.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.876
{\an9}We swore that we would tamp down
our sadness for Joy's sake.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.962
{\an8}No, you're right.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.839
{\an8}We just have to act as if we're
happy that she's leaving us.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.175
{\an8}Oh, hey, you.

04:19.257 --> 04:20.343
{\an8}Are you awake?

04:20.426 --> 04:21.386
{\an8}What are you talking about?

04:21.469 --> 04:22.720
{\an8}Oh, nothing.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.430
{\an9}We were just talking about
how excited we are

04:24.514 --> 04:25.807
{\an8}that you're getting married.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.517
{\an8}Yes,
and how exciting it's gonna be

04:27.600 --> 04:29.352
{\an8}to have an extra room
in the house.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.020
{\an9}Good point, Victoria.
Ooh!

04:31.104 --> 04:32.105
{\an8}What shall we do with this room?

04:32.188 --> 04:34.857
{\an7}Well, we have talked about
starting an extra shoe room.

04:34.941 --> 04:35.566
{\an8}That's a great idea.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.026
{\an9}Yes.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.861
{\an9}See, Joy,
great news for everybody.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.699
{\an8}Ah.
There's our little patient.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.200
{\an8}So how are you feeling?

04:44.283 --> 04:46.744
{\an7}Good.
Where have you two been?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.413
{\an9}I took your mom
to the import store

04:48.496 --> 04:50.039
{\an9}so she could buy you
some Marmite.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.541
{\an7}Marmite?

04:51.624 --> 04:54.252
{\an8}It's a healthful yeast
by-product.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.586
Rejoyla loves it.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.255
No, I don't really like it.

04:57.338 --> 05:00.049
You don't know what you like.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.509
Why are you still in bed?

05:01.592 --> 05:03.428
{\an1}Well, the procedure was just
a few hours ago.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.762
The doctor said
she should rest.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.347
Oh, rubbish.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.266
When I got rid of my sixth toe,

05:08.349 --> 05:10.560
I simply wrapped
a rubber band around it

05:10.643 --> 05:12.311
until it fell off
like a lamb's tail.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.775
I may never eat.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.861
{\an1}Why don't we give Joy and Bob
a few minutes alone?

05:22.572 --> 05:24.240
{\an1}Thank you for taking care
of my mother.

05:24.323 --> 05:25.575
I enjoy her.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.286
{\an3}My Canadian politeness
is the perfect foil

05:28.369 --> 05:29.746
for her British imperiousness.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.539
We British aren't imperious.

05:31.622 --> 05:35.084
{\an3}And I'm too Canadian
to disagree.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.920
{\an1}Well, my advice to you is to
compliment her and feed her gin,

05:38.004 --> 05:39.589
and everything should go well.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.467
{\an1}Oh, I'm so happy
I have you to deal with her.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.969
{\an3}Well, then why do you look
so sad?

05:45.053 --> 05:48.097
Melanie and Victoria don't seem
too upset that I'm moving out.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.267
In fact, they seem excited
to be taking over my room.

05:51.350 --> 05:52.643
Well, that's good, Joy.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.228
The last thing you want
is for people to be sad.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.355
I suppose you're right.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.733
{\an3}In fact, move in with me
right now.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.568
Rip the Band-Aid off fast.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.320
{\an3}You know, when I moved out
of my parents' place,

06:02.403 --> 06:04.614
{\an3}I did it swiftly so
there would be no hard feelings.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.241
You were 34.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.619
{\an3}33 1/2.
Don't make me seem like loser.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.547
Alex, we need to talk.

06:21.631 --> 06:22.757
One moment.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.133
I'm gonna check
on my baby backs.

06:31.182 --> 06:34.352
Are those hickory-smoked?

06:34.435 --> 06:36.354
You know your ribs.

06:36.437 --> 06:40.149
{\an3}Of course, it takes a great rack
to know one.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.317
{\an3}Now, what did you want
to tell me?

06:41.400 --> 06:42.985
Oh, it can wait.

06:46.280 --> 06:50.827
Is it such a burden for Joy to
wear the Scroggs family veil?

06:50.910 --> 06:55.373
{\an3}Yes, it smells of camphor
and lacerates the skin.

06:55.456 --> 07:00.002
{\an3}But marriage isn't meant
to smell nice or feel good.

07:00.086 --> 07:04.423
{\an1}Important words to hear
on the verge of my wedding.

07:04.507 --> 07:05.550
{\an3}Thank you.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.177
{\an3}It's so nice
to feel appreciated.

07:10.054 --> 07:13.516
{\an3}I think perhaps
what I'm really upset about is

07:13.599 --> 07:15.852
{\an3}that Joy hasn't apologized
to me yet.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.186
{\an1}For what?

07:17.270 --> 07:20.439
{\an3}That she's getting married
in France.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.692
{\an1}And?

07:22.775 --> 07:26.320
{\an3}She knows perfectly well
that Daniel, my ex,

07:26.404 --> 07:30.241
{\an3}broke up with me
in a French restaurant.

07:30.324 --> 07:34.704
{\an1}Well, let me apologize
for both of us and for Daniel.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.873
{\an1}I'm ashamed of my sex, knowing
there's a man out there

07:36.956 --> 07:38.875
who gave up such
a gorgeous woman.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.711
{\an3}Oh, Bob.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.672
{\an3}Something so charming
about a man apologizing.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.717
They say
when you're with a woman,

07:47.800 --> 07:49.218
you should look at her mother
if you want

07:49.302 --> 07:50.553
to know what lies ahead.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.055
And when I look at you,

07:53.139 --> 07:56.100
I see my future in your eyes.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.435
And I like what I see.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.105
You are a flatterer.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.232
{\an1}Oh, it's not flattery
if it's true.

08:05.359 --> 08:08.487
{\an1}Hey, why don't I get us another
round of these gin martinis?

08:10.281 --> 08:12.867
{\an1}Oh, you've got an eyelash there.
Let me get that.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.293
So, Daddy, about you and Elka.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.379
Oh, she's a real tomato.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.298
And speaking of tomatoes,

08:27.381 --> 08:30.927
I was thinking of preparing my
special three-day chili for her.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.385
{\an3}Three days?

08:32.470 --> 08:35.222
That's sounds like
a pretty big commitment.

08:35.306 --> 08:38.142
How long does a sandwich take?

08:38.226 --> 08:41.270
{\an1}Victoria, I was hoping
to speak with--oh, hello.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.438
Hello.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.606
Alex Chase:

08:43.688 --> 08:45.942
Victoria's father, Elka's lover.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.485
Philipa Scroggs:

08:47.568 --> 08:52.281
Joy's mother and recipient
of too much information.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.618
Nothing sweeter than the musical
lilt of an English accent.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.953
Would you like to join us
for dinner?

08:57.036 --> 08:58.579
I've got some ribs warming
in the oven.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.580
No, thank you.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.499
I prefer my meat
the English way,

09:01.582 --> 09:03.251
with the color boiled out of it.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.502
{\an3}Ah.

09:04.585 --> 09:05.920
Ladies, excuse me.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.006
Oh, I feel terrible.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.424
Oh, don't worry about Daddy.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.926
{\an3}He takes everything
as a compliment.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.511
It's a Chase family trait.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.513
No, not him.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.515
{\an1}There's something
weighing on my heart,

09:17.598 --> 09:19.308
and I need to tell someone.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.601
Oh, of course, Philipa.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.353
{\an3}What is it?

09:22.436 --> 09:24.105
I think I'm in love Bob.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.073
You're in love with Bob,
your daughter's fiancé?

09:34.156 --> 09:36.158
Oh, it's so wrong.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.451
I just can't help myself.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.370
{\an3}All right.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.831
{\an3}I won't tell anyone about this
and neither should you.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.709
{\an3}You just have
to tamp down your feelings.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.795
{\an3}And you can hide them
by being extra nice to Joy.

09:47.878 --> 09:50.464
"Be extra nice to Joy."
Uh-hmm.

09:50.548 --> 09:54.135
It's odd on the tongue.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.721
Yes, I do owe her that much.

09:56.804 --> 10:01.017
{\an1}Oh, why is so hard
to be a mother?

10:01.100 --> 10:03.728
{\an3}I used to ask my children's
nannies the same thing.

10:07.773 --> 10:08.899
{\an3}What's this?
What's going on?

10:08.983 --> 10:10.693
Bob packed up my stuff.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.028
I decided to move in
with him early.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.321
{\an3}What?

10:13.404 --> 10:15.072
I mean, that's great news.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.866
{\an3}We just thought that
you weren't gonna do that

10:16.949 --> 10:18.200
until after the wedding.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.495
I wasn't,
but why drag it out, right?

10:21.579 --> 10:24.707
So I'll leave, and you can get
started on turning my room

10:24.790 --> 10:25.708
into your shoe room.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.209
That's true.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.711
We can get started right away
on the shoe room.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.046
{\an3}Yes, let's get started
on the shoe room.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.881
{\an3}And what a lovely shoe room
this will be.

10:31.964 --> 10:32.882
She's gone.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.010
You can stop saying "shoe room."

10:36.093 --> 10:37.511
Although, congratulations to us.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.388
{\an1}That was some pretty good
tamping down of our feelings.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.223
Speaking of tamping down,

10:41.307 --> 10:42.099
{\an3}I'm tamping down the urge
to tell you something

10:42.183 --> 10:44.143
{\an3}I promised I wouldn't tell
anyone.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.062
{\an1}Victoria, we've been friends
for over 30 years.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.521
We both know how this ends.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.731
All right, I'll tell you.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.901
{\an3}Philipa has fallen in love
with Bob.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.194
{\an1}What?

10:53.277 --> 10:54.362
Oh, my God.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.404
{\an1}How long have you been tamping
that down?

10:55.488 --> 10:58.240
15 whole minutes.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.826
{\an3}Look, now,
she's not gonna act on this.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.537
{\an3}And the most important thing is
that Joy never finds out.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.290
{\an3}We have to make this the
happiest time of her life.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.583
{\an1}Even though she doesn't seem
to care

11:07.666 --> 11:08.793
about our feelings very much.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.127
{\an3}I know.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.921
{\an3}It's like she cut off
her sixth toe,

11:12.004 --> 11:15.883
{\an3}and now she can't stop
walking away.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.718
{\an1}Maybe that toe was
where her heart was.

11:23.724 --> 11:28.270
{\an3}Oh, Rejoyla, a day's bed rest
has done you the world of good.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.482
{\an3}You look two
to three years younger.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.442
Thank you, Mother.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.277
{\an3}Here, let me take that box for
you, darling, put it in the car.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.321
{\an3}You rest.

11:37.405 --> 11:40.616
{\an3}Oh, and by the way, if you don't
want to wear the family veil,

11:40.699 --> 11:41.867
that's quite all right.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.166
Bob, you're amazing.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.961
Well, I guess somebody heard
I did eight push-ups

11:52.044 --> 11:54.755
at the gym today.

11:54.839 --> 11:55.756
{\an3}No.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.841
I'm talking about my mother.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.467
She's never been so sweet.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.802
{\an3}Whatever you're doing,
keep it up.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.304
{\an3}In fact, double down
and do more.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.472
Don't you worry, Joy.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.141
{\an1}Tell your mother
to tighten her suspenders.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.101
{\an1}I'm about to charm
her pants off.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.981
[crickets chirping]

12:12.064 --> 12:14.150
You complete me.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.526
{\an1}Really?

12:15.609 --> 12:17.862
Sorry.
I was talking to the ribs.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.282
Fair enough.

12:24.743 --> 12:27.997
Look, Alex,
this isn't gonna work.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.332
{\an1}I knew it.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.501
It was inevitable, I suppose.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.337
{\an1}But it was a wild ride,
you and me.

12:35.421 --> 12:39.091
{\an1}Me hanging onto to bronc,
waiting for that bell to ring.

12:39.175 --> 12:42.386
{\an1}And my lasso, she could only
keep you tied up so long.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.641
(Alex)
Elka?

12:47.725 --> 12:50.019
Elka?

12:50.102 --> 12:51.520
Oh, sorry.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.897
Meat coma.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.819
Well, an actor knows when it's
time to make a solitary exit.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.574
I'll never find another woman
like you, Elka.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.368
That's true.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.746
On the other hand,
what do you think of Philipa?

13:12.124 --> 13:13.709
Oh, my God, Bob.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.377
I haven't moved out my stuff,

13:15.461 --> 13:17.296
and they've already turned it
into their shoe room.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.340
They're not sad
I'm leaving at all.

13:19.423 --> 13:22.426
{\an1}Maybe they're just jealous
that you're marrying me.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.053
[chuckling]
Oh, Bob.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.554
That's what I love about you.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.181
You always make me laugh.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.850
Right.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.560
So how's it going with my mum?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.062
She's not here yet.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.064
Well, find out how long
she's staying.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.148
If it's gonna be more
than a week,

13:36.232 --> 13:38.400
see if you can entice her
into going to a hotel.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.527
I'll do my best.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.569
Oh, here she is.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.571
Wish me luck.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.949
Philipa, a vision as always.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.951
{\an1}Thank you for joining me
for lunch.

13:47.034 --> 13:49.203
I won't be staying long.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.579
Well, then I will cherish
the moments

13:50.663 --> 13:51.705
that we do have together.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.499
In fact, I was wondering,

13:53.582 --> 13:56.585
how much more time will we have
you here in Cleveland?

13:56.669 --> 13:57.920
Till the wedding,
of course.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.463
No.

13:59.547 --> 14:03.133
Only four more brief weeks?

14:03.217 --> 14:04.426
Well, then I'm gonna suggest

14:04.510 --> 14:07.596
something old
and unconventional.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.892
How would you feel about
checking into a hotel?

14:11.976 --> 14:14.270
{\an3}Really?

14:14.353 --> 14:16.981
{\an3}A hotel?

14:17.064 --> 14:21.068
I think it might make
everything easier.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.653
What do you think?

14:22.736 --> 14:26.073
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

14:26.156 --> 14:30.452
I'm saying I want to see you
in the best hotel room in town.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.456
Room service, champagne,
whatever your heart desires.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.292
What about Joy?

14:36.375 --> 14:38.460
Oh, she'll be a little sad
at first.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.921
But I'm sure she'll come around
to accepting it.

14:41.005 --> 14:44.341
More than anything, she wants
you to be happy, as do I.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.634
{\an3}Oh.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.012
This is all so overwhelming.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.889
{\an3}I felt foolish having feelings
for you.

14:50.973 --> 14:51.974
Feelings?

14:54.268 --> 14:56.478
{\an3}Now I know that you share
those feelings,

14:56.562 --> 14:58.272
I'm over the moon.

14:58.355 --> 15:00.274
But...

15:00.357 --> 15:02.192
{\an3}It will be difficult dealing
with Rejoyla.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.946
{\an3}But let's not worry about
that now.

15:06.030 --> 15:10.075
{\an3}Oh, Bob,
you make me feel so alive.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.370
I'm going to pick up
something disgraceful

15:13.454 --> 15:14.955
at Victoria's Secret.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.848
Joy, do you need any help
in there?

15:32.931 --> 15:34.516
No, no.
I can do it myself.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.727
By herself.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.812
{\an1}Well, I guess she doesn't need
us at all anymore.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.856
{\an3}No, no.
Tamp, tamp.

15:40.939 --> 15:43.233
{\an3}We can feel those feelings
but we can't say them.

15:43.317 --> 15:46.403
(Joy)
I'm ready.

15:46.487 --> 15:47.404
(Victoria)
Aww.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.656
{\an3}[gasps]
Oh.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.491
{\an1}Oh.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.368
You look beautiful.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.827
{\an3}I hate you.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.039
What?

15:57.122 --> 15:58.332
I couldn't hold it in anymore.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.042
You didn't hold it in at all!

16:00.125 --> 16:01.251
And I hate you too.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.878
Why?

16:02.961 --> 16:05.381
{\an3}Because you're leaving us,
and you don't care.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.840
I don't care?

16:06.924 --> 16:08.050
You're the ones who don't care.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.176
You couldn't wait for me to go

16:09.259 --> 16:10.552
to make more room
for your shoes.

16:10.636 --> 16:11.553
I hate both of you.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.097
But we only acted like that

16:13.180 --> 16:14.682
{\an3}because you were acting
like you couldn't care less.

16:14.765 --> 16:18.018
I was tamping down my feelings
for your sake.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.854
{\an1}We were tamping down
our feelings for your sake.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.606
{\an3}We don't hate you.
We love you.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.526
{\an3}And you look so beautiful
in your dress.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.236
I love you too.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.697
[all crying]

16:29.780 --> 16:30.698
[cell phone pings]

16:30.781 --> 16:31.740
Oh, there's your phone.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.576
It's your phone.
Get it.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.245
Oh, it's my mother.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.579
"On my way over.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.581
Have something awkward
to discuss."

16:39.665 --> 16:41.583
Oh, my God.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.920
That's British for
"I'm about to ruin your life."

16:45.003 --> 16:47.131
Wait, what if she's sick?

16:47.214 --> 16:48.757
I can't stand her,

16:48.841 --> 16:50.759
but I don't want something bad
to happen to her.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.969
She's in love with Bob.

16:52.052 --> 16:55.723
I'll kill the bitch.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.808
(Philipa)
Rejoyla, prepare yourself.

16:57.891 --> 16:58.934
I'm going to make a scene.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.147
Oh, my goodness.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.442
Oh, you look stunning.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.236
You're the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.820
Thank you.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.781
That's a very sweet thing
to say.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.702
But I believe you came here
to tell me something.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.619
Yes, I did.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.998
But looking at you now,

17:21.080 --> 17:24.792
I realize
what I wanted to say is...

17:24.877 --> 17:26.962
I'm a silly old fool.

17:27.045 --> 17:28.297
What are you talking about?

17:28.380 --> 17:29.965
Oh, I've been in a bad place

17:30.048 --> 17:32.676
ever since Daniel broke up
with me.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.595
I've been lonely and vulnerable,

17:34.678 --> 17:37.139
and it's led me to some
very peculiar behavior.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.100
(Bob)
Joy, are you in there?

17:40.184 --> 17:41.435
Bob, you can't come in here.

17:41.518 --> 17:42.603
You can't see the dress.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.813
(Bob)
I'll cover my eyes.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.441
{\an1}Joy, I need to talk to you
before your mother gets here.

17:47.524 --> 17:48.150
Hello, Bob.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.693
{\an1}Ah!

17:51.737 --> 17:53.155
Joy, what did she say to you?

17:53.238 --> 17:55.199
I didn't say anything to her.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.993
{\an3}But I want to say something
to you, Bob.

17:58.076 --> 18:00.996
{\an3}You shouldn't love any woman
but Joy.

18:01.079 --> 18:04.792
She's strong and brave,
and you're lucky to marry her.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.377
{\an3}And if you say or do anything
to hurt her,

18:07.461 --> 18:10.005
I'll rip off your head
and spit down the hole.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.348
I love Joy.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.099
{\an1}I'll never do anything
to hurt her.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.976
See that you don't.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.770
Good-bye, Bob.

18:27.981 --> 18:31.026
So, Joy, how much do you know?

18:31.109 --> 18:32.736
{\an3}I know that my mother fell
in love with you

18:32.820 --> 18:34.863
{\an3}because I made you
be extra nice to her.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.032
{\an3}And nobody can resist
your charms

18:37.115 --> 18:38.492
when you're turning them on.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.369
Well, that was easy.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.079
I didn't think I'd get out of
here without a bunch of yelling.

18:42.162 --> 18:44.206
[all yelling at once]

18:44.289 --> 18:45.207
Ah, there it is.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.925
[crickets chirping]

18:55.008 --> 18:57.928
I am so glad you decided
not to move out

18:58.011 --> 18:58.929
until after the wedding.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.722
{\an3}Me too.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.851
Now, we can do this the right
way: in slow, painful stages.

19:03.934 --> 19:04.852
{\an3}[chuckles]

19:04.935 --> 19:06.854
{\an1}Yeah.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.730
I'm really gonna miss coming in
here and just sitting with you.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.942
This room does have
a lot of memories.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.903
Especially that bed.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.405
That's why
I'm not sitting on it.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.119
{\an1}And we have decided to keep
your room just as it is.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.495
You can come back
and visit anytime.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.417
{\an3}Thank you for a lovely visit,
Rejoyla.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.710
I'm returning to London now,

19:29.793 --> 19:32.379
{\an3}but I shall see you in Paris
on the big day.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.590
You're leaving so soon?

19:34.673 --> 19:35.924
Can I at least give you a lift
to the airport?

19:36.008 --> 19:38.635
She has one.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.470
Daddy, that is so sweet.

19:40.554 --> 19:43.891
{\an3}Philipa has promised to give me
a culinary tour of Britain.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.018
That should only take an hour,

19:46.101 --> 19:48.562
{\an3}giving us plenty of time for--
how shall I put this?

19:48.645 --> 19:51.148
{\an3}Sex.

19:51.231 --> 19:54.401
{\an1}Let's go
before I change my mind.

19:54.484 --> 19:55.903
- Bye, love.
- Bye-bye.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.533
He's boorish, and uncouth, and I
just might do him on the plane.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.206
Well, I guess that worked out.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.921
So my mum is gonna sleep
with your dad.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.964
Well, come to think of it,
he also slept with my mom.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.799
And me.

20:17.883 --> 20:18.842
{\an1}Yeah.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.636
{\an1}And Joy and I both slept
with Bob.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.138
And you and I both slept with
Captain LeBeau from the ship.

20:23.221 --> 20:25.140
And Melanie and I both slept
with Kyle,

20:25.223 --> 20:26.433
the guy who left at the altar.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.517
And we both slept with Mitch.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.603
And we all slept with Sinatra.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.024
Oh, wait, it was just me.
