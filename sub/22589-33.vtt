00:09.802 --> 00:13.932
<i>NARRATOR".
Another pleasant night steals over Gotham City.</i>

00:14.140 --> 00:16.226
<i>And speaking of stealing...</i>

00:19.729 --> 00:22.690
<i>...what unholy alliance is this?</i>

00:22.899 --> 00:28.488
<i>The Catwoman and that cunning
continental criminal, the Sandman?</i>

00:29.906 --> 00:31.908
My record's been clean for months.

00:32.116 --> 00:34.077
I'm no longer even on parole.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.496
You can't blame me for not trusting you.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.332
After all, I haven't been in Gotham City
for long.

00:39.832 --> 00:44.128
If you didn't think you could trust me,
why did you go to the trouble of finding me...

00:44.337 --> 00:46.339
...and asking my advice and help?

00:47.131 --> 00:49.050
Good point.

00:51.052 --> 00:53.596
Two of my henchmen
are waiting in the corridor...

00:53.805 --> 00:57.725
...to put the rest of my
somnambulistic scheme to work.

00:58.268 --> 01:01.229
Sweet dreams, Sandman.

01:04.732 --> 01:08.736
- How did it go, Sandman?
-Like a lullaby. She can be of great help to me.

01:09.153 --> 01:11.739
What a cat-and-mouse game, Catwoman.

01:11.948 --> 01:14.492
We were so fascinatingly feline.

01:14.701 --> 01:16.286
Thank you, kittens.

01:16.494 --> 01:20.999
Soon J. Pauline Spaghetti's fortune
will be in my claws alone.

01:21.207 --> 01:27.547
And Sandman will find himself entwined
in my cat's cradle forever.

01:27.922 --> 01:30.925
And when J. Pauline Spaghetti's fortune
is in my hands...

01:31.134 --> 01:34.345
...I'll put Catwoman to sleep forever.

01:35.805 --> 01:37.724
I have fed the catfish, Catwoman...

01:37.932 --> 01:39.851
...watered the caterpillar ferns...
-Mm.

01:40.059 --> 01:42.103
...and re-made your couch
in your favorite...

01:42.270 --> 01:44.230
...cat-skin comforter.
-Mm.

01:44.397 --> 01:47.108
And now I should pick up
some fresh catnip.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.110
Mm...

01:51.404 --> 01:55.742
Fresh catnip at this time of night?

02:00.955 --> 02:03.499
- Commissioner Gordon.
-This is Policewoman Mooney.

02:03.708 --> 02:05.460
Your hunch was right.

02:05.877 --> 02:07.712
Meow!

02:08.420 --> 02:10.798
Policewoman Mooney!
Policewoman Mooney!

02:13.009 --> 02:14.886
Something's happened.

02:15.386 --> 02:18.097
Just as we suspected, Chief O'Hara.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.808
Sandman and Catwoman are in cahoots.

02:21.017 --> 02:24.812
In spite of all her promises
to go straight. Ha.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.273
You know what this could mean
to Gotham City?

02:27.482 --> 02:31.903
'Tis an ill wind that blows
across this proud borough tonight.

02:32.111 --> 02:35.573
I hesitate calling on Batman
at this hour, but...

02:35.782 --> 02:38.284
Especially since no crime
has been committed.

02:38.493 --> 02:40.620
No crime? My every instinct tells me...

02:40.828 --> 02:44.582
...that a member of our own fine force,
Policewoman Mooney, is in dire danger.

02:44.791 --> 02:46.292
And who knows what may follow...

02:46.501 --> 02:49.504
...when Gotham City's foremost female felon,
Catwoman...

02:49.712 --> 02:53.341
...has aligned herself
with Europe's crack criminal, Sandman.

02:53.549 --> 02:57.804
I must alert the Caped Crusader
for the sake of us all.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.347
There it is again.

03:00.765 --> 03:03.101
That funny beeping sound
from Bruce's study.

03:03.267 --> 03:06.813
Uh, no doubt some of his
hi-fi equipment needs adjusting.

03:07.021 --> 03:09.273
Now, excuse me, madam.

03:11.109 --> 03:12.860
Hi-fi?

03:13.069 --> 03:16.239
Beeping with Bruce out of the city?

03:16.948 --> 03:20.868
I'm sorry to report, sir,
but Batman is away on personal business.

03:21.202 --> 03:25.498
Oh. Uh, of course. Thank you.

03:26.499 --> 03:29.669
He's away on personal business.

03:30.670 --> 03:33.339
I'm afraid we've been overlooking something,
Chief O'Hara.

03:33.548 --> 03:36.676
Batman has a life of his own
which we know nothing about.

03:36.884 --> 03:41.180
Well, even Batman is entitled
to a wee bit of privacy.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.391
Oh, if I might make a suggestion.

03:43.599 --> 03:44.642
Do. Please do.

03:44.851 --> 03:47.603
- The Bat-Signal, commissioner.
-Good.

<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile in the back country...</i>

03:59.907 --> 04:01.367
Bruce, the Bat-Signal.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.954
There must be trouble in Gotham City.

04:05.371 --> 04:07.206
I sure hope Batman sees it.

04:07.749 --> 04:09.709
Yes, so do I.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.673
Sack time, fellas.

04:15.882 --> 04:17.884
Go down to the creek and brush your teeth.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.387
Then come back
and hit the old sleeping bags.

04:30.855 --> 04:32.106
We better get back to town.

04:32.315 --> 04:36.903
How? We can't take these boys out of here
on a 20-mile hike this time of night.

04:38.029 --> 04:39.113
What's the matter?

04:39.322 --> 04:40.698
My ear's ringing.

04:40.907 --> 04:42.909
It's probably the altitude.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.327
Some altitude.

04:44.535 --> 04:49.582
It keeps saying, "To the Batpoles,
to the Batpoles, to the Batpoles."

06:08.536 --> 06:10.121
<i>NARRATOR".
What do we have here?</i>

06:10.329 --> 06:13.291
<i>An advertising stunt?</i>

06:13.499 --> 06:16.919
<i>Or maybe something else entirely?</i>

06:17.128 --> 06:18.671
Do you really think she's asleep?

06:18.880 --> 06:21.591
Or else she's putting on a great act.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.968
Good heavens, who's that man?

06:24.176 --> 06:26.220
He can't be part of the display.

06:41.277 --> 06:46.115
You mean the young lady taken out of that
window wasn't even employed by your store?

06:46.324 --> 06:51.412
That's right, the girl we hired wasn't supposed
to go to sleep on the job until noon today.

06:51.621 --> 06:54.916
While no one was watching, this other female
managed to get through security...

06:55.082 --> 06:56.834
...and make her way to the bed.

06:57.001 --> 06:59.462
Of course, she was asleep in an instant.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.297
Those Morpheus Mattresses.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.049
<i>Like sleeping on a zephyr.</i>

07:03.257 --> 07:05.509
This is no time for a sales pitch,
Mr. Smuggly.

07:05.718 --> 07:08.596
I'll call you back
as soon as we have something to go on.

07:10.056 --> 07:13.476
Good thing we don't run this department
like he runs that slumber section. Heh.

07:13.684 --> 07:17.355
Slumber section, Morpheus Mattresses,
sleeping on a zephyr?

07:17.563 --> 07:20.441
Mother Machree,
we're on the same wavelength.

07:20.650 --> 07:23.235
- Sandman?
-Can there be any doubt about it?

07:23.444 --> 07:26.030
Or that Catwoman is somehow involved?

07:26.238 --> 07:29.825
Be careful of that.
It's still warm from the last try.

07:30.034 --> 07:33.955
Grain by grain, the hen fills her belly,
Chief O'Hara.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.206
Sir?

07:35.414 --> 07:39.460
A pithy proverb about patience.
Batman told it to me himself.

07:40.628 --> 07:44.090
Alfred, that beeping sound
is beginning to disturb me.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.550
I'll have another go at the hi-fi, madam.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.349
Oh.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.018
No, sir. I regret to inform you--

07:57.395 --> 07:58.646
One second. He's here now.

08:01.482 --> 08:04.568
I've been sorely tempted
to have this device disconnected, sir.

08:04.777 --> 08:07.071
I well understand, Alfred.
Yes, commissioner?

08:07.279 --> 08:08.447
Batman. Batman.

08:08.656 --> 08:12.326
L-- I won't waste time telling you
how glad I am to have finally reached you.

08:12.535 --> 08:13.744
Please don't. Go on.

08:13.953 --> 08:17.623
Well, we suspect that canny continental crook,
Sandman, is in Gotham City...

08:17.832 --> 08:20.001
...has made contact with Catwoman,
and the two of--

08:20.418 --> 08:23.796
Say no more. We'll be there
in a matter of minutes, commissioner.

08:24.005 --> 08:25.756
About that ringing in your ears...

08:25.965 --> 08:28.259
Oh, it's louder than ever.

08:29.385 --> 08:31.220
- To the Batpoles!
-To the Batpoles!

08:52.491 --> 08:56.203
Once more, what do <i>we</i> have here?

08:56.412 --> 09:00.916
<i>Today's exclusive scoop
is Sleeping Beauty.</i>

09:01.125 --> 09:03.127
<i>Or rather the young lady
who was abducted...</i>

09:03.294 --> 09:06.380
...from <i>the Morpheus Mattress window display
this morning...</i>

09:06.964 --> 09:09.675
<i>...and miraculously made her escape...</i>

09:09.884 --> 09:15.473
<i>...and just appeared in our studio here
to tell her story.</i>

09:15.681 --> 09:18.184
<i>- Catwoman.
- No, I'm not here to tell my story.</i>

09:18.392 --> 09:21.145
She should get an award for sheer gall.

09:21.353 --> 09:26.567
<i>I'm here to tell about
the most heavenly sleep I've ever had.</i>

09:26.984 --> 09:28.986
<i>Yes. Well, there I was.</i>

09:29.570 --> 09:31.238
<i>Your run-of-the-mill customer...</i>

09:31.781 --> 09:33.532
<i>...having just bought this nightgown.</i>

09:33.741 --> 09:37.995
<i>When I saw the mattress display in the window,
well, I thought I'd catch a cat--</i>

09:38.204 --> 09:39.789
<i>Forty winks.</i>

09:39.997 --> 09:44.960
<i>And the next moment,
there I was sleeping like a dream.</i>

09:45.169 --> 09:48.297
<i>Completely unaware
that you were in a store window.</i>

09:48.714 --> 09:50.382
<i>Oh, unaware.</i>

09:50.591 --> 09:53.094
<i>Thanks to Dr. Somnambula...</i>

09:53.302 --> 09:56.847
<i>...I can sleep anywhere, any time.</i>

09:57.181 --> 09:59.225
<i>Dr. Somnambula?</i>

09:59.433 --> 10:02.394
<i>I'm sorry, but this is no place
for free commercials.</i>

10:02.770 --> 10:04.772
<i>I wouldn't do that.</i>

10:04.980 --> 10:08.609
<i>Well, you see, I bought all these nightgowns,
but I couldn't sleep.</i>

10:08.818 --> 10:11.529
<i>Dr. Somnambula cured me.</i>

10:11.737 --> 10:14.990
<i>Dr. Somnambula can make anyone sleep.</i>

10:15.407 --> 10:16.492
<i>Uh-- Uh--</i>

10:16.659 --> 10:19.537
<i>Let's get back to your abduction.</i>

10:19.995 --> 10:23.624
<i>Shall we, ladies and gentlemen?
Ha-ha.</i>

10:26.919 --> 10:28.879
<i>She's gone. Heh-heh.</i>

10:29.255 --> 10:31.382
Of course she's gone.

10:31.924 --> 10:35.886
There's a devious and dangerous design here
someplace, Chief O'Hara.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.347
I'm beginning to think you're right,
commissioner.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.642
And what audacious arrogance.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.145
Where the devil is Batman?

10:45.354 --> 10:47.106
But <i>while</i> the Caped Crusaders...

10:47.273 --> 10:51.068
<i>...head for their rendezvous
with a diabolical destiny...</i>

10:51.402 --> 10:57.158
<i>...once more, what do we have here
in this abandoned mattress factory?</i>

10:57.366 --> 10:58.576
You surprised me, Catwoman.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.704
I saw the broadcast,
you were charmingly convincing.

11:01.912 --> 11:05.875
- Except when I almost said "catnap." Hm?
-But you didn't.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.627
Your disguise was perfect
and it worked like a dream.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.672
Now all of Gotham City will have heard
of Dr. Somnambula...

11:11.881 --> 11:16.093
...and no one will suspect that I shall be he.
Not even J. Pauline Spaghetti.

11:17.469 --> 11:21.640
Don't be alarmed. That phone is listed
as my office. Pretend you're my nurse.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.478
Dr. Somnambula's office.

11:26.687 --> 11:31.275
Uh, this is J. Pauline Spaghetti. Hm.
I'd like to speak to the doctor.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.361
The doctor is quite busy at the moment,
Mrs. Spaghetti.

11:34.570 --> 11:38.449
There are 80 patients in the office,
206 in the waiting room...

11:38.657 --> 11:42.912
...and the line outside extends
around Gotham Park several times.

11:43.287 --> 11:48.000
I am only interested in my own problems,
nobody else's.

11:48.209 --> 11:52.004
I saw that Sleeping Beauty
on television today.

11:52.171 --> 11:57.635
Uh, I want to know what his fee is
for a penthouse call.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.930
Penthouse call.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.058
Fifty thousand dollars.

12:04.266 --> 12:07.895
I will give him a hundred thousand
if he's here in 10 minutes.

12:08.103 --> 12:11.982
Top floor of the J. Pauline Spaghetti Hotel.

12:12.191 --> 12:14.818
I'll give him your message, Mrs. Spaghetti.

12:15.027 --> 12:17.279
He'll try to get back to you today.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.491
- Did we get the 50?
-Hundred thousand.

12:20.658 --> 12:24.703
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. What fun I'll have
with all those billions of dollars.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.830
You'll have, Sandman?

12:27.039 --> 12:28.666
We'll have, Catwoman.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.709
That's better.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.587
I do hope this little caper
will attract Batman and Robin.

12:33.796 --> 12:36.465
I hope so too.
That's where I thought you'd be invaluable.

12:36.674 --> 12:39.426
- As a decoy for the Dynamic Duo?
-Not exactly a decoy.

12:39.593 --> 12:42.972
Between us, we should be able
to handle the caped crime-fighters.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.598
Perfectly.

12:49.228 --> 12:51.772
- That was a quick trip.
-Yes.

12:54.275 --> 12:58.195
Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara
didn't have much to offer.

12:58.404 --> 13:00.531
One, a policewoman has vanished.

13:00.739 --> 13:04.034
Two, Catwoman and Sandman
are apparently in cahoots.

13:04.243 --> 13:06.787
Three, a girl was abducted
from a store window.

13:06.996 --> 13:08.580
Four, she turned up on television.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.375
And five, she disappeared.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.544
You're right, Batman, it's nothing.

13:13.752 --> 13:18.966
Of course, as Commissioner Gordon says,
it all could be building up to something.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.969
Let's try putting ourselves
into Sandman's shoes.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.138
What would he be after?

13:24.346 --> 13:26.598
Money.
Isn't that what we've always heard?

13:26.807 --> 13:28.392
Exactly, old chum.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.604
And into whose eyes
would he scatter his sand to get that money?

13:32.813 --> 13:33.939
Someone very rich.

13:34.148 --> 13:38.193
And very likely,
someone who has trouble sleeping.

13:38.402 --> 13:43.407
Or why the pointed plug on television
for Dr. Somnambula?

13:43.615 --> 13:44.867
Holy alter ego.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.578
You think Sandman and Dr. Somnambula
are one and the same?

13:47.745 --> 13:53.250
I do, Robin. And I also think
that ersatz Sleeping Beauty is Catwoman.

13:53.459 --> 13:59.048
And it's all some murky masquerade
to hoodwink a hapless, sleepless moneybags.

13:59.256 --> 14:02.885
Now, can you name
some famous insomniacs?

14:03.093 --> 14:05.346
Well, there was Olaf the Sad of Norway.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.306
He's been dead for 800 years.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.851
And that famous Chinese historian,
Fu Hop Chung.

14:11.060 --> 14:13.479
Born with no eyelids.

14:13.687 --> 14:17.232
The French empress whose head stayed awake
even after she'd been guillotined?

14:17.441 --> 14:22.237
Poor creature. No, no, it must be
someone here in Gotham City right now.

14:22.446 --> 14:25.824
Let's give the Batcomputer a crack at it.

14:35.459 --> 14:37.378
Batman, look!

14:37.669 --> 14:39.046
Why...?

14:39.254 --> 14:40.839
What skinny macaroni.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.759
No. It's spaghetti, Robin.

14:43.967 --> 14:47.554
A variety of elementary paste...

14:47.763 --> 14:53.602
...larger than vermicelli,
but not as tubular as maca--

14:54.061 --> 14:56.271
That's it. Spaghetti.

14:56.480 --> 15:00.401
J. Pauline Spaghetti,
one of the richest women in the world...

15:00.567 --> 15:03.112
...who made a fortune in noodles...

15:03.320 --> 15:07.282
...and who searched the world over
for a solution to her sleeping problems.

15:07.491 --> 15:11.036
Is that the J. Pauline Spaghetti
who owns the J. Pauline Spaghetti Hotel?

15:11.203 --> 15:16.291
One and the same. And she's right here
at that hotel in Gotham City now.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.044
There isn't a second to waste, Robin.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.134
How long have you been suffering
from insomnia, Mrs. Spaghetti?

15:25.759 --> 15:30.889
Ever since I made my second billion
with my secret noodle recipe.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.350
Heh-heh. That's very interesting.

15:33.559 --> 15:38.647
Oh, about seven years ago,
I did doze for a few moments...

15:38.856 --> 15:41.525
...at a rock 'n' roll concert.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.735
Since then, nothing.

15:44.194 --> 15:47.156
I'm sure I can help you, Mrs. Spaghetti.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.287
First of all...

15:54.163 --> 15:56.999
...let's see what the stethoscope tells us.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.629
What does the stethoscope tell you
about my forehead?

16:02.796 --> 16:05.090
Ha-ha-ha. My dear Mrs. Spaghetti.

16:05.299 --> 16:08.969
The intransitive roots of your sensory-motor
activity are located right here...

16:09.178 --> 16:12.806
...between your paladinious canals
and your sinualidated cavities.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.767
Wonderful.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.397
Are you asleep, Mrs. Spaghetti?

16:20.814 --> 16:23.025
Yes, doctor.

16:23.484 --> 16:25.611
Where do you keep your financial records?

16:25.819 --> 16:29.573
In my dressing table,
just like any other woman.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.826
Get them for me.

16:59.937 --> 17:03.065
Here's my financial journal.

17:03.565 --> 17:06.693
Go back to bed again and lie down,
Mrs. Spaghetti.

17:06.902 --> 17:10.071
Sweet dreams,
and let nothing disturb you.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.334
"Oil fields:

17:22.542 --> 17:27.172
Texas, Oklahoma, Saudi Arabia,
Outer Mongolia.

17:28.131 --> 17:31.760
Diamond mines:
Montana, South Africa, Brazil.

17:32.636 --> 17:36.431
Cash deposits: Gotham City National Bank,
Gotham City Security Bank...

17:36.640 --> 17:39.518
...Gotham City Continental Bank,
Gotham City--"

17:46.858 --> 17:49.861
I told you to stay on the terrace
in case I ran into trouble.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.321
You've run into trouble.

17:51.655 --> 17:54.449
A funny-looking jalopy
parked in the rear alley a minute ago.

17:54.658 --> 17:57.119
Some kind of a hook
snagged the terrace railing.

17:57.327 --> 18:02.082
And two way-out characters are climbing
up the wall on ropes. Real weirdoes.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.751
Batman and Robin. Get out of here.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.837
By the front way.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.715
I'll wrap this up in a jiffy.

18:31.445 --> 18:33.739
- What happened?
-You've been in the land of Nod...

18:33.947 --> 18:36.408
...Mrs. Spaghetti.
Not for long, but it was a start.

18:37.242 --> 18:41.121
Oh, wonderful.

18:41.455 --> 18:45.959
You are my savior, Dr. Somnambula.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.795
Oh, I want you always by my side.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.965
I want you to call me J. Pauline.

18:56.303 --> 19:00.557
- Batman. Robin. What brings you here?
- He did.

19:00.766 --> 19:03.268
If he's Dr. Somnambula.

19:03.477 --> 19:09.232
Oh, indeed he is.
My own beloved Dr. Somnambula.

19:09.441 --> 19:14.154
He has just given me the first real sleep
I have had in years.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.156
We have good reason to believe...

19:16.323 --> 19:21.495
...that Dr. Somnambula is also Sandman,
the notorious European criminal.

19:21.703 --> 19:22.746
And after your money.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.248
That is utterly ridiculous.

19:25.749 --> 19:29.378
He may just have stolen something
while you were asleep.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.381
- Do you keep your valuables here?
-Yes.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.883
My dressing table drawer.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.096
You must keep busy, Batman.

19:39.304 --> 19:42.099
Climbing walls
and making unfounded accusations.

19:42.307 --> 19:43.433
Unfounded?

19:43.642 --> 19:45.519
We know you're in cahoots with Catwoman.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.355
Catwoman? Who is Catwoman?

19:48.855 --> 19:52.401
We'll talk about that later.
And if anything's missing--

19:52.609 --> 19:54.903
There is nothing missing.

19:55.112 --> 19:57.406
MY jewelry.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.908
My financial ledger.

20:00.117 --> 20:05.038
Two or 300,000 dollars
I keep for pin money. It is all here.

20:05.247 --> 20:07.124
- Are you sure?
- I am positive.

20:07.541 --> 20:14.506
And I refuse to listen to any more nonsense
about that medical genius, Dr. Somnambula.

20:14.715 --> 20:16.174
He...

20:16.717 --> 20:17.759
He's gone.

20:21.805 --> 20:27.144
Oh. You've driven him away
with your stupid charges.

20:27.352 --> 20:28.395
I'm sorry.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.189
Even before he was paid.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.816
I apologize.

20:33.024 --> 20:36.611
Oh, how can I ever sleep again?

20:37.195 --> 20:41.324
I don't know whether I can help you with that,
Mrs. Spaghetti.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.910
Perhaps if we left you alone.

20:44.494 --> 20:47.581
Yes. Suppose you do that.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.583
That door leads to the hall.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.460
The hall leads to the elevator.

20:51.668 --> 20:57.048
The elevator leads to the street.
It's quicker than any Batrope.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.975
<i>NARRATOR". Moments later,
in the Morpheus Mattress Factory...</i>

21:07.142 --> 21:10.479
<i>...Batman and Robin are back
on the Sandman's trail.</i>

21:10.687 --> 21:12.397
That was a brainstorm of yours.

21:12.606 --> 21:15.650
Checking with Commissioner Gordon about
the signs in Sleeping Beauty's window.

21:15.817 --> 21:19.571
Our encounter with J. Pauline Spaghetti
woke me up a little, old churn.

21:19.738 --> 21:21.990
But let's beware and be wary.

21:22.157 --> 21:28.121
There is something about this place
that seems a little strange.

21:31.374 --> 21:33.251
It's nap time for both of you.

23:18.356 --> 23:21.067
All right, boys, put him to bed.

23:23.028 --> 23:26.114
This machine will button you up forever,
Batman.

23:26.323 --> 23:29.618
Wonder Boy, or whatever they call you,
start the machine.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.961
Robin. What have they done to you?

23:46.551 --> 23:51.264
I'm sorry we can't remain for the last stitch,
but you were right about me and Catwoman.

23:51.473 --> 23:54.809
And I promised her a little souvenir
of this quilting bee.

23:56.144 --> 23:59.439
Robin will fill the bill nicely. Take him.
