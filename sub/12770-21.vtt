WE'LL GET THIS SORTED OUT.

05:58.166 --> 06:00.041
ALL RIGHT? I PROMISE.
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.

(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

06:04.000 --> 06:05.417

WHEN IT STARTED.

06:05.458 --> 06:06.834

06:06.875 --> 06:09.041
COULD YOU
BE MORE SPECIFIC?

06:10.709 --> 06:13.208
SUDDENLY, HE WANTED SEX
ALL THE TIME.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.834
WELL, IT'S NOT UNCOMMON

06:14.875 --> 06:16.875
FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE FLUCTUATIONS
IN THEIR SEX DRIVE.

06:16.917 --> 06:19.041
THIS WASN'T
A FLUCTUATION, DR. WALLACE.

06:19.083 --> 06:21.000
I COULDN'T--I CAN'T
CONTROL MYSELF.

06:21.041 --> 06:23.250
IT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
FOR ME.

06:23.291 --> 06:25.125
AND I WORRY ABOUT MY DAUGHTER.

06:25.166 --> 06:26.959
(girl) HE USED...

06:27.000 --> 06:29.041
TO BE DIFFERENT.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.375
HE WAS MY FAVORITE PERSON
TO DO STUFF WITH.

06:31.417 --> 06:35.041
HE WASN'T SO...

06:35.083 --> 06:37.041
IT'S OKAY.

06:38.333 --> 06:41.166
HE LOOKS AT ME WEIRD.

06:41.208 --> 06:44.041
AND HE COMES IN
WHEN I ASK HIM NOT TO.

06:44.083 --> 06:46.041
COMES IN WHERE?

06:46.083 --> 06:48.834
INTO THE BATHROOM...

06:50.083 --> 06:51.834
WHEN I'M SHOWERING.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.667
(man) I'M SORRY.

06:53.709 --> 06:56.375
I DON'T WANT TO LIE.

06:56.417 --> 06:59.041
I HAVE SEXUAL FEELINGS
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER.

06:59.083 --> 07:01.083

07:01.125 --> 07:03.709
I CAN'T CONTROL THEM.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.542

WHITNEY?

07:05.583 --> 07:07.709
NO.

07:07.750 --> 07:11.208
BUT NOW...

07:11.250 --> 07:12.834
I'M SCARED.

07:12.875 --> 07:15.917
THE THINGS YOU TRY
TO DO TO ME,

07:15.959 --> 07:19.625
YOU WANT TO DO TO... HER?

07:19.667 --> 07:21.083
NO.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.959
I WANT YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.041
LORI, PLEASE.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.125
PLEASE WHAT?
HE'S A MONSTER.

07:25.166 --> 07:26.417
RICH?

07:26.458 --> 07:27.959

07:28.000 --> 07:29.041

07:29.083 --> 07:31.041

07:31.083 --> 07:32.041

THESE DECISIONS,

07:32.083 --> 07:33.250

07:33.291 --> 07:34.500
THEY'RE IN
A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP.

07:34.542 --> 07:36.041
I'M NOT DISAGREEING,

07:36.083 --> 07:38.041
BUT UNTIL THE LAW CHANGES,
HE'S NOT TECHNICALLY FAMILY.

07:38.083 --> 07:41.000
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA LET
THAT BIGOT CALL THE SHOTS?

07:41.041 --> 07:42.875
LOOK, IT'S TAKING EVERY OUNCE
OF RESTRAINT FOR ME

07:42.917 --> 07:44.792
NOT TO PUNCH TROY'S FATHER
IN THE FACE.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.917
I'VE SEEN ROGER AND TROY
TOGETHER, AND THEY'RE A FAMILY.

07:46.959 --> 07:48.041
BUT IF SOMETHING WERE
TO HAPPEN TO MAYA,

07:48.083 --> 07:49.792
AS HER FATHER,
I WOULD WANT TO BE HEARD.

07:49.834 --> 07:51.000
YEAH, BUT YOU WOULD ALSO
WANT TO HONOR HER WISHES.

07:51.041 --> 07:52.375
TROY TOLD ROGER

07:52.417 --> 07:54.375
THAT HE NEVER WANTED TO BE
HOOKED UP TO A VENTILATOR.

07:54.417 --> 07:56.125
LOOK, I SPOKE TO
THE HOSPITAL LAWYERS.

07:56.166 --> 07:58.792
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW WE FEEL
ABOUT IT. THE LAW IS CLEAR.

07:58.834 --> 08:00.583
WITHOUT A LIVING WILL
OR DIRECTIVE,

08:00.625 --> 08:02.500
TROY'S MEDICAL DECISIONS
ARE MADE BY NEXT OF KIN,

08:02.542 --> 08:03.917
THAT IS HIS FATHER.

08:03.959 --> 08:06.041
YOU NEED TO GET TROY
ON A VENTILATOR RIGHT NOW.

08:06.083 --> 08:07.291
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.291
(door opens)

08:10.333 --> 08:12.917
(footsteps approach)

08:12.959 --> 08:14.041
(knock on door)

08:14.083 --> 08:15.125
(Sheldon) HEY.

08:15.166 --> 08:17.041
I WANTED TO COME BY SOONER,

08:17.083 --> 08:18.834
BUT I HAD A PATIENT,
AND, UH,

08:18.875 --> 08:20.500
I JUST, UH...

08:20.542 --> 08:21.959
I'M SO SORRY.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.041
DON'T SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

08:24.083 --> 08:26.709
I'M SICK OF EVERYONE
SAYING THEY'RE SORRY.

08:26.750 --> 08:29.083
ANYTHING ELSE?

08:29.125 --> 08:30.500
MY PATIENT, HE--

08:30.542 --> 08:32.000
HE SEIZED DURING THE SESSION--

08:32.041 --> 08:33.000
LEAVE THE FILE.

08:36.333 --> 08:39.625
(people speaking indistinctly)

08:39.667 --> 08:41.166
I CALLED YOU.

08:46.166 --> 08:47.959
I WAS HALFWAY
ACROSS THE WORLD--

08:48.000 --> 08:49.542
SO YOU DIDN'T GET
MY MESSAGE?
I GOT IT.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.875
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW, UH...

08:51.917 --> 08:53.834
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE GOING THROUGH.

08:53.875 --> 08:55.208
I'M--I'M SORRY.

08:55.250 --> 08:57.583
THERE'S THAT WORD AGAIN.
AMELIA--

08:57.625 --> 08:58.792
IT'S WEIRD, RIGHT?

08:58.834 --> 09:00.792
THAT SAME WORD CAN APPLY
TO SO MANY THINGS.

09:00.834 --> 09:03.041
SORRY I WAS LATE.
SORRY I DIDN'T CALL YOU.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.000
SORRY YOUR BABY
DOESN'T HAVE A BRAIN.

09:06.709 --> 09:08.834
I WAS GOING THROUGH SOMETHING,
AND I--

09:08.875 --> 09:11.208
GO AWAY. I'M BUSY
GROWING A BRAINLESS BABY.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.041
YOU KNOW, I'M--IT TAKES
MOST OF THE ENERGY

09:14.083 --> 09:17.500
I WOULD OTHERWISE WASTE
TALKING TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.041
(chip clatters)

09:23.083 --> 09:24.709
(closes drawer)

09:27.291 --> 09:28.583
IF WHITNEY IS FRIGHTENED
IN HER OWN HOME,

09:28.625 --> 09:30.000
THAT'S REASON ENOUGH
TO SUSPECT ABUSE,

09:30.041 --> 09:31.709
AND WE HAVE TO REPORT RICH
TO D.C.F.S.

09:31.750 --> 09:33.500
YOU DIDN'T SEE
HOW TORN UP HE WAS.
UH, NO, THAT'S BECAUSE

09:33.542 --> 09:34.917
I WAS
TALKING DOWN A 12 YEAR OLD

09:34.959 --> 09:36.083
WHOSE FATHER
HAD VIOLATED HER PRIVACY.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.041
THE E.E.G. SHOWED A LESION
ON HIS TEMPORAL LOBE,

09:38.083 --> 09:40.041
WHICH IS CAUSING
SUBCLINICAL SEIZURES,

09:40.083 --> 09:41.667
WHICH MANIFEST
AS HYPERSEXUALITY

09:41.709 --> 09:43.500
AND AN INABILITY
TO CONTROL HIS IMPULSES.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.041
YOU'RE MAKING EXCUSES
FOR A PEDOPHILE?

09:45.083 --> 09:47.792
HE'S NOT A PEDOPHILE. RICH NEVER
LAID A HAND ON WHITNEY.

09:47.834 --> 09:49.208
AND THERE'S BEEN
NO PRIOR HISTORY

09:49.250 --> 09:50.625
OF THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.041
BUT NOW, RIGHT NOW,

09:52.083 --> 09:53.417
RICH ADMITS TO HAVING
SEXUAL FEELINGS FOR WHITNEY.

09:53.458 --> 09:54.709
OKAY, A GUY LIKE THAT,

09:54.750 --> 09:56.083
HE DOESN'T GET TO BE HER DAD,
SHELDON.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.041
SUDDEN BEHAVIORAL CHANGES,
SCARRING ON THE TEMPORAL LOBE,

09:58.083 --> 10:00.041
THIS IS A TEXTBOOK CASE
OF KLUVER-BUCY SYNDROME.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.291
YOU GONNA REPORT HIM?

10:01.333 --> 10:02.542
WE'D BE ACCUSING HIM
OF CHILD MOLESTATION

10:02.583 --> 10:03.875
AND POTENTIALLY RUINING
HIS LIFE.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.250
WHAT ABOUT WHITNEY'S LIFE?

10:05.291 --> 10:06.667
WHAT, ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
JUST WAIT

10:06.709 --> 10:08.041
UNTIL RICH TAKES THE NEXT STEP?

10:08.083 --> 10:09.083
HE WON'T
BECAUSE I CAN FIX HIM

10:09.125 --> 10:10.125
BY REMOVING THE LESION.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.208
CAN YOU GUARANTEE THAT?

10:12.250 --> 10:14.041
OKAY, EVEN IF SHE COULD
STOP HIS SEXUAL URGES,

10:14.083 --> 10:16.750
HOW'S THIS GUY EXPECT TO EVER
WIN BACK HIS DAUGHTER'S TRUST?

10:16.792 --> 10:17.959
IS ACCUSING HIM
OF BEING A SEX OFFENDER

10:18.000 --> 10:19.041
A BETTER WAY TO REBUILD
THAT TRUST?

10:19.083 --> 10:20.333
ALL RIGHT, FORGET ALL THAT.

10:20.375 --> 10:22.041
WHITNEY'S SAFETY HAS TO BE
THE TOP PRIORITY.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.125
THEN LET ME HELP
THIS FAMILY.

10:23.166 --> 10:25.250
I CAN DO IT.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.458
(Roger) SARAH CALLED
AND LEFT A MESSAGE

10:26.500 --> 10:27.917
ASKING IF YOU WERE OKAY.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.500
SHE ALSO REMINDED ME

10:29.542 --> 10:31.500
THAT "ALL MY SONS"
IS COMING TO TOWN NEXT WEEK

10:31.542 --> 10:33.542
AND THAT WE SHOULD BUY TICKETS.

10:33.583 --> 10:36.041
ONE DAY YOU--
ROGER.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.875
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE, RIGHT?

10:38.917 --> 10:40.250
TROY'S DAD WENT HOME.

10:40.291 --> 10:43.583
AND I SNUCK PAST
THE NURSES' STATION, SO...

10:43.625 --> 10:45.333
ARE YOU GONNA TURN ME IN?

10:45.375 --> 10:47.250
(sighs) NO.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.041
(monitor beeping rhythmically,
ventilator hissing and clicking)

10:49.083 --> 10:50.792
TROY WOULD HATE THIS.

10:50.834 --> 10:52.917
ALL THIS FIGHTING?

10:52.959 --> 10:54.792
WE MET AT A FIGHT.

10:54.834 --> 10:57.041
WELL, IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A WEDDING,

10:57.083 --> 11:00.166
BUT TWO OF THE GIRLS FROM
THE BRIDAL PARTY GOT INTO IT.

11:00.208 --> 11:03.291
I MEAN, HIP CHECKS, ELBOWS--
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.

11:03.333 --> 11:04.917
BUT TROY--

11:04.959 --> 11:06.500
MORTIFIED.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.750
HE...

11:08.792 --> 11:10.583
HE BLUSHED.

11:10.625 --> 11:13.333
AND I FELL FOR HIM,
RIGHT THERE.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.709
IS THERE ANY WAY
YOU CAN TALK TO CARL

11:15.750 --> 11:18.083
TO CHANGE HIS MIND?

11:18.125 --> 11:20.709
TROY'S MOM DIED
WHEN HE WAS REALLY YOUNG,

11:20.750 --> 11:22.709
AND SO HE WAS REALLY CLOSE
WITH HIS DAD,

11:22.750 --> 11:24.625
BUT HE WAS AFRAID
TO COME OUT TO HIM

11:24.667 --> 11:26.417
UNTIL WE GOT TOGETHER,

11:26.458 --> 11:29.542
AND THEN HE JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO HIDE ME, SO...

11:29.583 --> 11:31.041
AND HIS DAD CAN'T ACCEPT IT.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.625
HE CUT HIM OFF.
STILL, TROY KEPT TRYING.

11:33.667 --> 11:36.750
HE WANTED HIS DAD
TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS

11:36.792 --> 11:40.041
THE SAME BOY, THE SAME MAN
THAT HE ONCE LOVED.

11:40.083 --> 11:42.458
I MEAN, I CALLED CARL
BECAUSE I KNOW

11:42.500 --> 11:44.625
THAT TROY STILL LOVES HIS DAD.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.834
AND CARL, I MEAN, HE...

11:46.875 --> 11:49.166
HE HAS TO LOVE TROY, TOO,
RIGHT?

11:49.208 --> 11:51.625
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
HE CAN'T LET TROY GO.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.834
YEAH, WELL,
NOW IT'S TOO LATE.

11:53.875 --> 11:56.166
AND TROY...
THIS ISN'T WHAT HE WANTED.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.750
(Sheldon) HEY, YOU KNOW,
I'M WORRIED.

11:58.792 --> 12:00.041
AMELIA?

12:00.083 --> 12:01.041
YEAH, AMELIA.

12:01.083 --> 12:02.250
JOIN THE CLUB.

12:02.291 --> 12:03.458
NO, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

12:03.500 --> 12:04.667
(sighs) I'VE TRIED
TALKING TO HER.

12:04.709 --> 12:05.875
SHE SHUT YOU DOWN, TOO?

12:05.917 --> 12:07.041
REPEATEDLY.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.458
THAT'S NOT GOOD.
SHE HAS TO TALK TO SOMEONE.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.625
I MEAN, THIS PREGNANCY
IS RIFE WITH--IT'S TRAGIC,

12:10.667 --> 12:12.041
AND GIVEN HER PAST, I--

12:12.083 --> 12:13.625
WELL, SHE'S NOT TALKING
TO US,

12:13.667 --> 12:15.250
BUT JAKE IS HELPING HER.

12:15.291 --> 12:16.625
WITH WHAT?

12:16.667 --> 12:18.041
HE'S HER O.B.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.375
THAT'S IT?

12:19.417 --> 12:20.583
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY?

12:20.625 --> 12:22.000
WELL, IF IT'S NOT ME,
IT SHOULD BE YOU.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.583
I MEAN, C--WHO'S JAKE?

12:23.625 --> 12:26.458
JAKE IS WHO SHE CHOSE.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.375
THE BABY'S FETAL HEART RATE
IS STRONG. THAT'S--

12:29.417 --> 12:32.083
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

12:32.125 --> 12:34.000
ARE YOU PLANNING A SLIP?

12:35.709 --> 12:37.250
MY WIFE USED TO
PLAY WITH ONE OF THOSE

12:37.291 --> 12:39.041
WHEN SHE WAS PLANNING
A SLIP.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.625
YOU DON'T PLAN A SLIP.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.875
THAT'S... THAT'S WHY
THEY CALL IT A SLIP.

12:42.917 --> 12:45.125
IT'S JUST...

12:45.166 --> 12:46.625
YOU FALL.

12:46.667 --> 12:49.291
SOMETIMES.
SOMETIMES YOU FALL.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.041
MY WIFE USED TO PLAN 'EM.

12:51.083 --> 12:53.625
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A WIFE.

12:53.667 --> 12:56.875
ARE YOU...
PLANNING A SLIP?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.125
YOU STILL MARRIED?

12:59.166 --> 13:01.667
NO.
ARE YOU PLANNING A SLIP?

13:01.709 --> 13:03.041
DIVORCED?

13:03.083 --> 13:04.500
IF YOU USE DRUGS, YOUR BABY
CAN'T BE A DONOR.

13:04.542 --> 13:06.041
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR WIFE?

13:06.083 --> 13:07.667
DID YOU HEAR ME?

13:09.417 --> 13:11.500
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR WIFE?

13:13.083 --> 13:14.875
YOUR BABY'S HEART RATE
IS STRONG.

13:14.917 --> 13:17.083
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.

13:20.959 --> 13:22.125
HEY.

13:22.166 --> 13:23.333
HEY.

13:23.375 --> 13:24.542
YOU BUSY?

13:24.583 --> 13:26.041
YEAH, I HAVE A LACERATION
I HAVE TO REPAIR.

13:26.083 --> 13:27.875
CAN IT WAIT?
I REALLY NEED SOME ANSWERS
ABOUT THE HOUSE.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.542
VIOLET, WHATEVER YOU WANT
IS FINE.

13:29.583 --> 13:30.750
PETE, THIS IS CRAZY.

13:30.792 --> 13:31.959
WE HAVE TO FIND SOME TIME
TO TALK.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.041
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A DOUBLE SHIFT.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.125
TOMORROW.

13:34.166 --> 13:35.333
I'M WORKING THEN, TOO.

13:35.375 --> 13:36.542
ARE YOU THE ONLY
E.R. DOCTOR IN L.A.?

13:36.583 --> 13:37.750
COME ON.
THERE--THERE HAS TO BE

13:37.792 --> 13:39.041
SOME TIME FOR US
TO HAVE A MEAL.

13:39.083 --> 13:40.125
MEET ME FOR BREAKFAST.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.709
WE CAN EAT IN THAT DAMN
CAFETERIA HERE IF YOU WANT--

13:41.750 --> 13:43.041
WHY?
WHAT WOULD THAT ACCOMPLISH?

13:43.083 --> 13:44.709
WE'RE SEPARATED, VIOLET.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.041
CLEARLY, WHAT I THINK
DOESN'T MATTER.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.291
I PAY HALF THE MORTGAGE
ON THAT HOUSE,

13:47.333 --> 13:48.625
BUT I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO SLEEP IN IT.

13:48.667 --> 13:50.542
I SAY,
"LET'S GET BACK TOGETHER,"

13:50.583 --> 13:52.125
YOU SAY,
"NO, LET'S DO THERAPY."
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:52.166 --> 13:53.750
IF YOU ARE MAD AT ME, THAT'S
FINE, BUT THIS CONCERNS LUCAS...

13:53.792 --> 13:55.208
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
SO YOU HAVE TO DEAL.

13:55.250 --> 13:57.166
THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT
IS LUCAS.

13:57.208 --> 14:00.375
I WOULD SEE HIM EVERY SINGLE DAY
IF YOU WOULD LET ME,

14:00.417 --> 14:03.041
BUT I HAVE ASSIGNED TIMES
WHEN I GET TO BE WITH MY CHILD.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.709
AND GIVEN EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON,

14:04.750 --> 14:07.500
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
I CARE ABOUT THAT HOUSE?

14:07.542 --> 14:09.500
SO SELL IT. DON'T SELL IT.

14:09.542 --> 14:11.291
JUST LEAVE ME OUT OF IT.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.709
(indistinct conversations)

14:12.750 --> 14:14.083
HEY,
IS SHE TALKING TO YOU?

14:14.125 --> 14:15.792
WHAT? WHO?

14:15.834 --> 14:17.542
AMELIA. ADDISON SAID
SHE'S TALKING TO YOU.

14:17.583 --> 14:19.375
SHE'S MY PATIENT,
AND I'LL TELL YOU

14:19.417 --> 14:20.542
THE SAME THING
I TOLD ADDISON.

14:20.583 --> 14:21.834
I CAN'T DISCLOSE--

14:21.875 --> 14:23.041
THAT'S CRAP.
SHE'S OUR COLLEAGUE, OKAY?

14:23.083 --> 14:25.041
SHE'S OUR FRIEND.
AND SHE'S MY PATIENT.

14:25.083 --> 14:26.834
AND WE SHARE INFORMATION
AT THIS PRACTICE.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.625
SOMETIMES, WHEN A PATIENT'S
HEALTH REQUIRES IT.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.041
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT OUR
PATIENT'S HEALTH IS IN DANGER.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.250
AND AS A THERAPIST--
LOOK, SHELDON--

14:31.291 --> 14:32.667
SHE'S AN ADDICT, JAKE.

14:32.709 --> 14:34.041
YEAH, I WAS AT THE INTERVENTION.
I'M FULLY AWARE OF THAT.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.417
THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.375
SHE'S NOT TALKING TO
HER FRIENDS, SHE'S SHUT DOWN,

14:37.417 --> 14:39.834
SHE'S PRACTICALLY DISSOCIATIVE,
AND YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

14:39.875 --> 14:41.834
TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN
TO HELP,

14:41.875 --> 14:43.208
AND THAT MEANS HELPING HER
STAY CLEAN.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.834
AND YOU THINK HELPING HER
MEANS I TELL YOU

14:44.875 --> 14:46.250
EVERYTHING SHE CONFIDES IN ME?

14:46.291 --> 14:48.667
I'M A SHRINK,
AND I KNOW HER, SO YES.

14:48.709 --> 14:49.792
THAT'S PRESUMPTUOUS.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.667
GET YOUR EGO OUT OF IT.
MY EGO?

14:51.709 --> 14:53.041
IT'S NOT ABOUT MY EGO.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.417
OH, THEN LET ME HELP YOU
HELP HER.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.875
SHELDON, YOU'RE EMOTIONAL
AND YOU'RE OVERSTEPPING

14:55.917 --> 14:57.875
SO JUST BACK OFF.

15:03.083 --> 15:04.166
AMELIA. AMELIA.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.375
WHAT?

15:05.417 --> 15:06.583
IF YOU WANT, I CAN TALK
TO RICH AND LORI ALONE,

15:06.625 --> 15:08.000
GO OVER THE MEDICAL OPTIONS--

15:08.041 --> 15:09.375
DID YOU SOMEHOW COMPLETE
YOUR NEUROSURGERY RESIDENCY

15:09.417 --> 15:10.583
ON YOUR HONEYMOON?

15:10.625 --> 15:12.000
YOU'RE ABOUT TO PITCH
A RISKY PROCEDURE

15:12.041 --> 15:13.375
TO A DESPERATE COUPLE,
OKAY?

15:13.417 --> 15:15.834
I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
YOUR HEAD IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.041
26.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.208
THAT'S THE NUMBER OF SURGERIES

15:18.250 --> 15:20.083
I HAVE COMPLETED
SINCE YOU LEFT--

15:20.125 --> 15:21.709
26 FLAWLESS SURGERIES--

15:21.750 --> 15:23.834
AND IN EACH ONE, I WAS
A RECOVERING ADDICT

15:23.875 --> 15:26.542
CARRYING THE BRAINLESS BABY
OF HER BOYFRIEND WHO OVERDOSED,

15:26.583 --> 15:28.041
SO DON'T EVEN
FOR A SECOND SUGGEST

15:28.083 --> 15:29.625
THAT I CAN'T
COMPARTMENTALIZE.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.667
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I SURVIVE.

15:32.709 --> 15:35.041
(Violet) PETE REFUSED
TO TALK TO ME.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.542
HE'D RATHER STAY IN THE E.R.
STITCHING UP BLOODY INJURIES

15:37.583 --> 15:40.041
THAN SPEND TIME
TALKING TO ME.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.500
WHY ARE YOU SO SMILEY?

15:41.542 --> 15:44.500
(laughs) I JUST...

15:44.542 --> 15:46.250
UH, IT USED TO BE YOU
GIVING ME ADVICE

15:46.291 --> 15:49.208
ABOUT MY SCREWED UP LIFE,
AND...

15:49.250 --> 15:50.834
IT'S NOT A MESS ANYMORE.

15:50.875 --> 15:52.625
I MEAN,
I HAVE THIS AMAZING WIFE,

15:52.667 --> 15:54.208
THIS INCREDIBLE KID.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.750
BUT I MEAN, I'M KEEPING
ALL THAT TO MYSELF

15:55.792 --> 15:57.041
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW.

15:57.083 --> 15:59.458
UH, SO PETE...

15:59.500 --> 16:01.750
IS HIDING OUT
IN THE E.R., RIGHT?

16:01.792 --> 16:03.041
AND I GET WHY. I DO.

16:03.083 --> 16:04.750
THAT'S A PLACE WHERE
HE CAN BE EFFECTIVE,

16:04.792 --> 16:07.125
AND HE'S A HERO IN THERE,
AND HE CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.542
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP,
THINGS ARE MESSY,

16:08.583 --> 16:09.959
THERE'S NO RIGHT ANSWER,

16:10.000 --> 16:11.750
BUT I'M NOT REALLY
THAT REPELLANT, AM I?

16:11.792 --> 16:13.875
AM I?

16:13.917 --> 16:15.041
WHAT? NO!

16:15.083 --> 16:17.709
NO. IT--IT HURTS FOR ME
TO SEE YOU LIKE THIS,

16:17.750 --> 16:19.959
AND I'M TRYING TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING TO SAY

16:20.000 --> 16:21.917
THAT'S GONNA PUT YOU AND PETE
BACK TOGETHER.

16:21.959 --> 16:23.542
BUT I MEAN, IS THAT
REALLY THE BEST THING?

16:23.583 --> 16:26.041
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:26.083 --> 16:30.041
I MEAN, YOU AND PETE AND LUCAS
ARE A GREAT FAMILY.

16:30.083 --> 16:33.917
BUT ARE YOU AND PETE
A GREAT COUPLE?

16:33.959 --> 16:35.917
I SAW YOUR PATIENT STEPHANIE.

16:35.959 --> 16:37.041
WAS IT
A PLACENTAL ABRUPTION?

16:37.083 --> 16:38.041
YEAH, A MINOR ONE.

16:38.083 --> 16:39.625
A FEW DAYS BED REST,
SHE'LL BE FINE.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.375
I'M SURE SHE'S THRILLED.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.291
AND SHE'LL HAVE HER BABY
IN SIX WEEKS.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.000
YEAH.

16:46.750 --> 16:48.041
DO YOU EVER WONDER ABOUT

16:48.083 --> 16:49.375
I DON'T KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS
TO ALL THESE KIDS

16:49.417 --> 16:51.041
THAT YOU GIVE PEOPLE?

16:51.083 --> 16:52.500
WELL, SOMETIMES THE PARENTS

16:52.542 --> 16:53.917
BRING THEM BY
SO I CAN MEET THEM.

16:53.959 --> 16:55.041
I GET THE HOLIDAY CARDS.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.125
DO YOU LIKE THAT?

16:57.166 --> 16:58.542
SURE.

16:58.583 --> 17:01.000
GOSH. I MEAN, TO A PARENT,

17:01.041 --> 17:02.625
YOUR BABY'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IN THE WORLD.

17:02.667 --> 17:06.041
I MEAN, I THINK ABOUT HENRY...
ALL THE TIME.

17:06.083 --> 17:08.041
I TALK ABOUT HIM ALL THE TIME,
TOO, UNTIL, YOU KNOW,

17:08.083 --> 17:10.041
I'M SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ANOTHER WORD.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.417
BUT I REALLY, I--
REALLY, I CAN'T HELP IT.

17:12.458 --> 17:15.375
NO, LISTEN, IT'S FINE.
YOU SHOULD ENJOY HIM.

17:16.709 --> 17:18.041
(laughs)

17:18.083 --> 17:20.417
WHAT?
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

17:20.458 --> 17:22.333
SAM WAS OVER THIS MORNING.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.834
I WAS ASKING HIM
FOR SOME PARENTING ADVICE.

17:24.875 --> 17:27.875
AND HE SAID THE EXACT
SAME THING. "JUST ENJOY HIM."

17:27.917 --> 17:29.041
WELL, THAT'S KIND OF IRONIC.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.041
WHAT, THE TWO OF YOU
GIVING THE SAME ADVICE?

17:31.083 --> 17:33.750
THAT YOU'RE ASKING IT
FROM SAM.

17:33.792 --> 17:36.709
E-EVER SINCE HENRY'S COME,
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, SAM'S...

17:36.750 --> 17:38.041
YEAH, HE'S BEEN GREAT.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.291
OH, I'M SURE.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.291
HEY, THANKS FOR
THE PATIENT UPDATE.

17:43.291 --> 17:46.083
THIS SCARRING IS LIKELY
CAUSING YOU TO HAVE SEIZURES.

17:46.125 --> 17:48.000
WHAT HAPPENED
IN DR. WALLACE'S OFFICE,

17:48.041 --> 17:50.041
I-I HAD NEVER
HAD THAT BEFORE.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.458
BUT CHANCES ARE,

17:51.500 --> 17:53.792
YOU'D EXPERIENCED HUNDREDS
OF MINOR SEIZURES

17:53.834 --> 17:56.250
PRIOR TO THAT ONE, AND BECAUSE
THE SEIZURES ARE OCCURRING

17:56.291 --> 17:58.041
IN THE PART OF YOUR BRAIN
THAT REGULATES IMPULSES,

17:58.083 --> 18:00.333
THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THE URGES.

18:00.375 --> 18:01.709
(Lori) CAN WE DO ANYTHING
ABOUT IT?

18:01.750 --> 18:04.041
I CAN DO A PARTIAL LOBECTOMY
TO REMOVE THE SCARRING

18:04.083 --> 18:05.458
AND STOP THE SEIZURES.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.583
AND RICH
WOULD BE NORMAL AGAIN?

18:07.625 --> 18:09.083
WELL, THAT'S THE HOPE,
BUT WE CAN'T TELL

18:09.125 --> 18:11.458
IF THIS WILL MEAN HE CAN
CONTROL ALL OF HIS IMPULSES

18:11.500 --> 18:13.417
WE HAVE WHITNEY TO THINK ABOUT.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.667
OF COURSE, BUT WHAT
SHE'S SAYING IS THAT MAYBE

18:15.709 --> 18:18.250
THIS ISN'T RICH'S FAULT,
MAYBE IT'S NOT HIM.

18:18.291 --> 18:19.959
WELL, EITHER WAY,
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND

18:20.000 --> 18:21.834
THAT THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL RISKS
TO THIS PROCEDURE.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.291
(Amelia)
WITH ANY BRAIN SURGERY,

18:23.333 --> 18:25.333
THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY
OF PERMANENT DAMAGE OR DEATH--

18:25.375 --> 18:27.041
I DON'T CARE.

18:27.083 --> 18:29.750
IF THERE IS EVEN A CHANCE

18:29.792 --> 18:32.709
THAT THIS WILL MAKE ME BETTER,
I WANT TO DO IT.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.083
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:34.125 --> 18:36.125
(Sam) THE VENTILATOR

18:36.166 --> 18:37.750
IS HELPING TROY OXYGENATE,

18:37.792 --> 18:41.208
UH, BUT HIS CARDIAC OUTPUT
IS STILL DOWN.

18:41.250 --> 18:44.041
WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS?

18:44.083 --> 18:46.041
WE COULD PUT HIM
ON AN L-VAD PUMP,

18:46.083 --> 18:48.083
GIVE HIM A LITTLE EXTRA TIME,
BUT, UH--

18:48.125 --> 18:49.709
BUT WHAT?

18:49.750 --> 18:52.041
WE'D JUST BE POSTPONING
THE INEVITABLE.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.041
TROY IS GOING TO DIE.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.959
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT
THE RELATIONSHIP

18:56.000 --> 18:58.041
BETWEEN YOU AND TROY
IS STRAINED,

18:58.083 --> 19:01.333
BUT IF TROY DOESN'T WANT
TO BE KEPT ALIVE BY MACHINES,

19:01.375 --> 19:03.709
IF--IF YOU DON'T MIND
ME ASKING,

19:03.750 --> 19:06.041
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

19:06.083 --> 19:07.959
WHEN TROY WAS GROWING UP,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.542
HE WAS MY BOY.

19:10.583 --> 19:14.667
I KNEW HIM, HOW HE THOUGHT,
WHAT MATTERED TO HIM.

19:14.709 --> 19:16.583
(sighs)
ROGER TURNED HIM AROUND,

19:16.625 --> 19:20.041
MADE HIM BELIEVE THINGS.

19:20.083 --> 19:22.750
HOW DO I EVEN KNOW THIS IS
REALLY WHAT TROY WANTS?

19:22.792 --> 19:25.625
THIS IS PROBABLY GONNA BE HARD
FOR YOU TO HEAR,

19:25.667 --> 19:28.709
BUT I BELIEVE THAT ROGER
REALLY LOVES TROY.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.417
SO I DON'T THINK HE'D EVER
LIE ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

19:31.458 --> 19:34.000
I REALLY DON'T THINK
HE'D BE WILLING TO LOSE HIM.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.417
PUT HIM ON THE PUMP.

19:37.458 --> 19:40.208
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

19:42.083 --> 19:44.208
WELL, THIS IS EITHER GONNA
BE AWESOME OR TERRIBLE.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.959
TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.208
(exhales, singsong voice)
AWESOME.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.458
MM.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.041
OH, WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

19:54.083 --> 19:56.041
PETE.
OH. EW!

19:56.083 --> 19:57.625
NO, IT'S JUST, HE'S--

19:57.667 --> 19:59.875
PETE'S BEING A ROYAL PAIN
IN MY ASS AT THE HOSPITAL,

19:59.917 --> 20:01.667
MAKING ME THE BAD GUY,
AND YOU KNOW HOW I HATE...

20:01.709 --> 20:03.208
COME ON.
BEING THE BAD GUY.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.041
NO, THIS WAS SO PROMISING.
MM.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.667
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
WITH HIM?

20:06.709 --> 20:10.041
EVERY FREE SHIFT I'VE GOT,
HE'S... PICKING IT UP,

20:10.083 --> 20:11.667
LIKE HE'S ON SOME KIND
OF A MISSION.

20:11.709 --> 20:13.041
OKAY, HE IS ON A MISSION.
HE'S HIDING FROM VIOLET.
WHY?

20:13.083 --> 20:14.792
OKAY, IF I ANSWER THIS,

20:14.834 --> 20:16.625
CAN WE...
GET BACK TO BUSINESS?

20:16.667 --> 20:17.834
YES.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.834
OKAY, VIOLET FEELS
THAT PETE IS AVOIDING HER

20:19.875 --> 20:21.041
'CAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO
THE NECESSARY WORK

20:21.083 --> 20:22.125
TO SAVE THE RELATIONSHIP.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.500
YOU KNOW, FIRST HE WANTED
TO GO TO EL SALVADOR,

20:23.542 --> 20:25.083
HE'S WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK
IN THE E.R.

20:25.125 --> 20:26.917
IT'S BAD FOR VIOLET.
IT'S WORSE FOR LUCAS.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.834
SHE'S AFRAID THAT PETE'S BEING
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE SO SHE'S--

20:28.875 --> 20:30.458
ENOUGH. I'VE GOT IT.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.041
NOW I WANT YOU TO BE
THE BAD GUY FOR A WHILE.

20:32.083 --> 20:33.875
OKAY.

20:33.917 --> 20:35.000
(pants)

20:36.417 --> 20:38.000
HEY THERE.
(static crackling over monitor)

20:38.041 --> 20:39.166
HEY.

20:39.208 --> 20:41.000
YOU FINISHING UP
OR JUST STARTING OUT?

20:41.041 --> 20:43.834
(beeps)
WELL, STARTING.
OR HOPING TO START.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.834
WHAT--WHAT IF HENRY
WAKES UP?

20:45.875 --> 20:48.166
WELL, THEN YOU POUR YOURSELF
ANOTHER GLASS. (chuckles)

20:48.208 --> 20:49.500
(chuckles) I'M SERIOUS.

20:49.542 --> 20:50.917
ADDISON, YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO HAVE A GLASS OF WINE.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.375
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE
MANY GLASSES OF WINE.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.417
OKAY, SO HE WAKES UP,
AND I'M DRUNK.

20:54.458 --> 20:57.542
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE TOO DRUNK
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

20:57.583 --> 21:01.417
BESIDES... YOU KNOW, BABIES
ARE VIRTUALLY INDESTRUCTIBLE.

21:01.458 --> 21:03.291
TAKE THAT.

21:03.333 --> 21:04.917
ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE ME DRINK ALONE?

21:04.959 --> 21:06.750
WELL, SOMEBODY'S GOTTA
BE HERE FOR HENRY, RIGHT?

21:06.792 --> 21:08.083
(chuckles)
FUNNY.

21:08.125 --> 21:11.458
LET ME GET SOME.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.041
OHH. I MISS THIS.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.250
WHAT, THE QUIET?

21:15.291 --> 21:17.041
NO, JUST SITTING WITH WINE,

21:17.083 --> 21:19.125
NOT THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING,
JUST...

21:19.166 --> 21:21.041
BEING.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.959
YEAH.

21:24.291 --> 21:26.542
WE USED TO DO THIS.

21:28.125 --> 21:30.792
YEAH, WELL,
NOW YOU HAVE HENRY.

21:30.834 --> 21:32.917
MM.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.166
MM.

21:34.208 --> 21:37.000
I MISS THIS, TOO.

21:38.083 --> 21:40.125
I MISS YOU.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.750
SAM--

21:41.792 --> 21:43.125
(Henry crying)

21:43.166 --> 21:45.041
(sighs)

21:45.083 --> 21:46.667
(laughs)

21:46.709 --> 21:48.959
GO GET HIM.

21:53.083 --> 21:54.208
(sighs)

22:02.083 --> 22:03.917
YELL AT ME.

22:03.959 --> 22:06.041
YOU WANT TO YELL AT ME.
YELL AT ME.

22:06.083 --> 22:08.166
ALL RIGHT? I CAN TAKE IT.

22:08.208 --> 22:11.083
I WISH I HAD BEEN HERE.

22:11.125 --> 22:13.083
I WISH I HAD COME BACK.

22:13.125 --> 22:15.083
AMELIA...

22:15.125 --> 22:16.500
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

22:16.542 --> 22:18.041
SO PLEASE...

22:18.083 --> 22:20.000
JUST LET ME HELP YOU.

22:28.083 --> 22:30.041
NO, AMELIA--
DON'T TALK.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.041
JUST DON'T TALK, OKAY?

22:32.083 --> 22:34.041
YOU SAID YOU WANT TO HELP.
THIS IS HOW YOU CAN HELP ME.

22:34.083 --> 22:35.208
NO, AMELIA--

22:35.250 --> 22:36.750
I KNOW
I'M NOT SEXY RIGHT NOW.

22:36.792 --> 22:38.417
I DON'T--I DON'T NEED YOU
TO THINK I'M SEXY.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.208
JUST... CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND THINK ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE.

22:41.250 --> 22:43.041
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO,
JUST...

22:43.083 --> 22:44.208
SHELDON, THIS IS
WHAT I NEED.

22:44.250 --> 22:45.625
LOOK, AMELIA, JUST STOP.

22:45.667 --> 22:49.709
IF YOU WANT TO HELP ME,
HELP ME FORGET. PLEASE.

22:51.625 --> 22:53.041
DID YOU TAKE SOMETHING?

22:53.083 --> 22:54.375
ARE YOU HIGH?

22:56.709 --> 22:58.542
(voice breaking)
IF I WERE HIGH,

22:58.583 --> 23:00.959
I WOULDN'T NEED YOU,
SHELDON.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.041
IF I WERE HIGH,
I WOULD BE ABLE TO BREATHE,

23:05.083 --> 23:06.417
TO FORGET.

23:06.458 --> 23:08.208
I'M NOT HIGH.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.875
AN ORGASM WOULD HELP ME.

23:10.917 --> 23:13.291
IT WOULD HELP ME
FOR A MINUTE.

23:13.333 --> 23:15.667
I NEED A MINUTE.

23:15.709 --> 23:18.083
IF I AM GONNA KEEP CARRYING
THIS BABY AND GIVE BIRTH TO HIM,

23:18.125 --> 23:20.458
I NEED AN ESCAPE, SHELDON.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.417
I NEED A MINUTE TO FORGET.

23:22.458 --> 23:25.375
PLEASE.

23:25.417 --> 23:27.625
AMELIA...

23:29.083 --> 23:31.750
I'M SORRY.

23:34.041 --> 23:37.166
(sniffles)
THERE'S THAT WORD AGAIN.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.041
HEY, BUDDY.

23:49.083 --> 23:50.417
HEY, MAN.

23:50.458 --> 23:51.625
YOU, UH, YOU FEEL LIKE
GRABBING A DRINK TONIGHT?

23:51.667 --> 23:53.041
RAIN CHECK?
OH, YOU GOT PLANS?

23:53.083 --> 23:54.834
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET HOME EARLY, RELAX...

23:54.875 --> 23:56.667
HEAD NEXT DOOR,
CHANGE A FEW DIAPERS.

23:56.709 --> 23:57.875
(laughs)

23:57.917 --> 23:59.083
(laughs)
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

23:59.125 --> 24:00.208
HEY, I'M NOT JUDGING.

24:00.250 --> 24:02.333
JUDGING?
WHAT'S THERE TO JUDGE?

24:02.375 --> 24:03.542
YOU, ADDISON, HENRY.

24:03.583 --> 24:05.417
RIGHT, THEY LIVE NEXT DOOR.
AND?

24:05.458 --> 24:06.625
SOUNDS CONVENIENT.

24:06.667 --> 24:08.667
WHAT DO YOU--WHAT DO YOU
THINK IS GOING ON?

24:08.709 --> 24:10.709
I DON'T KNOW.
IS SOMETHING GOING ON?

24:10.750 --> 24:12.041
ARE YOU JEALOUS?

24:12.083 --> 24:13.542
OH, COME ON, MAN.
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT MY THING.

24:13.583 --> 24:14.750
OH, AND IT'S MY THING?

24:14.792 --> 24:15.959
WELL,
YOU KEPT SAYING IT WASN'T,

24:16.000 --> 24:17.250
SO I HAVE TO TAKE YOU
AT YOUR WORD, RIGHT?

24:17.291 --> 24:18.667
WELL, I THINK
YOU ARE JEALOUS.

24:18.709 --> 24:21.000
NO. I'M THE MAN WHO'S
GOING OUT FOR A DRINK TONIGHT.

24:23.083 --> 24:24.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

24:24.083 --> 24:25.375
DR. WILDER.

24:25.417 --> 24:27.333
ROGER.
YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS.

24:27.375 --> 24:30.041
WHAT?

24:30.083 --> 24:31.500
"I COULD NEVER JUST LINGER
LIKE THAT.

24:31.542 --> 24:32.917
"ROGER WOULD GO BALLISTIC.

24:32.959 --> 24:35.792
HE'D SIT BY MY BEDSIDE,
SURE I WAS GONNA WAKE UP."

24:35.834 --> 24:37.500
I DON'T--
WHAT--WHAT IS THIS?

24:37.542 --> 24:39.041
IT'S FROM TROY'S JOURNAL.

24:39.083 --> 24:40.375
HE KEEPS ONE ON HIS COMPUTER.

24:40.417 --> 24:42.125
AND I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT
READING IT

24:42.166 --> 24:44.083
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO FIND SOME PROOF

24:44.125 --> 24:45.291
THAT THIS ISN'T
WHAT HE WANTS,

24:45.333 --> 24:46.709
AND IT SAYS SO RIGHT HERE.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.917
ROGER, THAT--UH,
IT'S NOT A LEGAL DOCUMENT.

24:48.959 --> 24:50.709
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN PAIN
AND YOU'RE ANGRY,

24:50.750 --> 24:52.083
AND I WANT TO HELP YOU--

24:52.125 --> 24:55.000
TROY IS SUSPENDED BETWEEN
HERE AND THE OTHER SIDE.

24:55.041 --> 24:56.375
NOW I LOVE HIM
AND I HAVE TO GIVE HIM

24:56.417 --> 24:58.041
THE PEACE THAT HE DESERVES,

24:58.083 --> 25:01.041
BUT... (sighs)

25:01.083 --> 25:02.750
DO YOU GET THAT?

25:02.792 --> 25:04.500
DO YOU UNDERSTAND LOVE?

25:04.542 --> 25:07.041
WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEBODY,
WHEN YOU REALLY LOVE THEM,

25:07.083 --> 25:10.625
YOU DON'T FORCE THEM TO STAY,
TO FIGHT, TO HANG ON.

25:10.667 --> 25:14.500
YOU LET THEM GO THE WAY
THAT THEY WANT TO GO.

25:14.542 --> 25:16.959
(people speaking indistinctly)

25:17.000 --> 25:19.417
HOW MUCH LONGER
DO YOU THINK IT'LL TAKE?

25:19.458 --> 25:22.041
HE GOES INTO SURGERY
IN AN HOUR.

25:22.083 --> 25:24.417
YOU KNOW IT'S OKAY
TO FEEL SCARED.

25:24.458 --> 25:26.041
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE,

25:26.083 --> 25:28.333
AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHY I AM.

25:28.375 --> 25:30.041
'CAUSE THIS IS SCARY...

25:30.083 --> 25:32.625
(chuckles)
BEING IN A HOSPITAL,

25:32.667 --> 25:34.959
KNOWING YOUR DAD
IS IN THERE,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.750
SEEING YOUR MOM
SO STRESSED.

25:37.792 --> 25:39.625
I HEARD HER ON THE PHONE
LAST NIGHT

25:39.667 --> 25:41.041
WITH MY UNCLE.

25:41.083 --> 25:44.000
SHE TOLD HIM MY DAD
COULD DIE FROM THE SURGERY.

25:44.041 --> 25:46.458
IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SCARED OF?

25:55.041 --> 25:57.583
I KNOW THAT IT'S CONFUSING
AND COMPLICATED,

25:57.625 --> 26:01.458
BUT IT IS STILL OKAY
TO LOVE YOUR DAD.

26:01.500 --> 26:04.041
(voice breaking)
I LOVE HIM.

26:04.083 --> 26:07.041
IT'S JUST WHAT HE DID.

26:07.083 --> 26:08.625
WHAT HE DID WAS HORRIBLE,

26:08.667 --> 26:13.041
AND I IMAGINE YOU'VE HAD
A LOT OF BAD DAYS SINCE.

26:13.083 --> 26:15.500
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME
SOMETHING, WHITNEY.

26:15.542 --> 26:17.625
PROMISE ME THAT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA FEEL BAD

26:17.667 --> 26:19.625
ABOUT TRYING TO LIVE
IN THE GOOD ONES, OKAY,

26:19.667 --> 26:21.041
THE GOOD DAYS?

26:21.083 --> 26:23.041
BECAUSE YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO FORGIVE HIM,

26:23.083 --> 26:26.792
YOU MAY NOT FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE EVER ABLE TO...

26:26.834 --> 26:28.291
TO TRUST HIM
IN THE SAME WAY AGAIN,

26:28.333 --> 26:30.959
BUT... BUT YOU DON'T
GET TO CHOOSE

26:31.000 --> 26:34.041
WHETHER YOU LOVE HIM
OR NOT.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.458
WE JUST LOVE 'EM.

26:39.166 --> 26:42.041
I CAN'T--I CAN'T--
I MEAN, HE'S JUST--

26:42.083 --> 26:43.542
WHOA. BREATHE.
BREATHE. BREATHE.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT ONLY...

26:43.583 --> 26:45.667
(inhales and exhales)
BREATHE. BREATHE.
BREATHE. BREATHE. BREATHE.

26:45.709 --> 26:46.750
(exhales deeply)

26:46.792 --> 26:48.917
(exhales slowly)

26:48.959 --> 26:50.041
(inhales)

26:50.083 --> 26:53.125
OKAY.
TRY COMPLETE SENTENCES.

26:53.166 --> 26:55.959
I CAN'T GIVE UP. I DON'T
WANT TO LET HIM GO.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.250
I DON'T.

26:57.291 --> 26:58.875
DOES THAT MAKE ME PATHETIC?

26:58.917 --> 27:00.542
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE
TELLING ME BEFORE?

27:00.583 --> 27:02.667
I MEAN, WITHOUT TELLING ME.

27:02.709 --> 27:04.083
WH-WHEN YOU SAID THAT--THAT--

27:04.125 --> 27:05.917
THAT PETE AND I WERE NOT
A GOOD COUPLE, WERE--

27:05.959 --> 27:07.875
DO YOU REALLY THINK I SHOULD
CUT MY LOSSES AND GO?

27:07.917 --> 27:10.041
VI, ALL I MEANT TO SAY WAS--
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:10.083 --> 27:11.500
I-I-I DON'T CARE.

27:11.542 --> 27:14.041
I DON'T CARE WHAT IT MAKES ME.
I-I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK.

27:14.083 --> 27:16.041
I, UM... I LOVE PETE.

27:16.083 --> 27:18.083
(crying) I LOVE MY FAMILY.

27:18.125 --> 27:20.500
AND I JUST WANT US
TO BE OKAY.

27:20.542 --> 27:22.041
AND I KNOW WE ARE NOT
ONE OF THOSE STORYBOOK COUPLES

27:22.083 --> 27:23.500
WITH STARS IN OUR EYES

27:23.542 --> 27:25.709
AND CARTOON HEARTS
FLOATING ABOVE OUR HEADS.

27:25.750 --> 27:27.041
I MEAN, WE HAVE BEEN TESTED.

27:27.083 --> 27:28.583
GOD KNOWS, THIS RELATIONSHIP
HAS BEEN TESTED,

27:28.625 --> 27:30.083
AND WE HAVE SURVIVED.

27:30.125 --> 27:31.291
(normal voice) SO, YOU KNOW,
TO HELL WITH EASY.

27:31.333 --> 27:32.500
I DON'T TRUST EASY.

27:32.542 --> 27:33.875
ANYTHING WORTH HAVING
SHOULDN'T BE EASY,

27:33.917 --> 27:35.250
BECAUSE THEN YOU TAKE IT
FOR GRANTED.

27:35.291 --> 27:36.792
PETE IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR.

27:36.834 --> 27:39.333
MY FAMILY
IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR.

27:39.375 --> 27:42.125
AND I AM SO SICK TO DEATH
OF ASKING HIM TO LISTEN TO ME.

27:42.166 --> 27:43.333
I'M NOT GONNA ASK ANYMORE.

27:43.375 --> 27:44.750
I'M GONNA GO DOWN
TO ST. AMBROSE

27:44.792 --> 27:46.333
AND I'M GONNA HAUL HIS
IMMATURE ASS OUT OF THAT E.R.,

27:46.375 --> 27:48.542
AND WE ARE GOING
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO,

27:48.583 --> 27:50.333
BECAUSE I WANT MY...

27:50.375 --> 27:52.417
STUBBORN, INFURIATING...

27:52.458 --> 27:55.041
AMAZING HUSBAND BACK.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.333
(exhales deeply)

27:56.375 --> 27:57.959
WHY ARE YOU STARING AT ME?

27:58.000 --> 28:01.083
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
TO BE SCARED OR AWED.

28:01.125 --> 28:03.709
(Pete) I THINK
THAT WHEN THERE'S CLEARLY

28:03.750 --> 28:05.750
A RIGHT WAY AND A WRONG WAY,
YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT WAY,

28:05.792 --> 28:07.041
NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS.

28:07.083 --> 28:08.625
WELL, WE DON'T AGREE
ON WHAT THE RIGHT WAY IS.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.083
I KNOW TROY,

28:10.125 --> 28:12.041
AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT TROY
AND ROGER HAVE TOGETHER

28:12.083 --> 28:13.375
AND THE SITUATION THEY'RE IN.

28:13.417 --> 28:15.000
AND IT'S AWFUL.
IT'S--IT'S UNFAIR--

28:15.041 --> 28:17.041
OH, COME ON, SAM.
YOU'RE TAKING THE EASY WAY OUT.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.667
YOU'RE HIDING BEHIND THE RULES
JUST LIKE CHARLOTTE.

28:18.709 --> 28:20.166
FIRST OFF, I'M NOT HIDING
BEHIND ANYTHING.

28:20.208 --> 28:21.875
I'M RESPECTING THE PROCESS,

28:21.917 --> 28:23.041
EVEN IF I DON'T LIKE
THE RESULT--

28:23.083 --> 28:24.667
WHO GIVES A DAMN
ABOUT THE PROCESS?

28:24.709 --> 28:26.166
LOOK, IT'S WHAT WE HAVE
TO LIVE WITH.

28:26.208 --> 28:28.583
NO. NO. WHAT WE HAVE TO
LIVE WITH IS OUR CONSCIENCE.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.041
LOOK, ALL RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM--

28:30.083 --> 28:31.667
BUT YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN.
OH, COME ON, MAN.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.375
NO, NO, YOU'VE MADE IT
VERY CLEAR WHOSE SIDE YOU'RE ON.

28:33.417 --> 28:34.583
YOU'RE NOT BEING FAIR.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.041
NO,
YOU'RE NOT BEING FAIR, SAM.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.000
(sighs)

28:41.583 --> 28:43.875
OKAY, RICH,
ARE YOU READY?

28:43.917 --> 28:45.458
JUST ONE THING.

28:45.500 --> 28:46.917
WHAT IS IT?

28:46.959 --> 28:48.458
IF YOU CAN'T GET
ALL THE LESION,

28:48.500 --> 28:51.917
IF YOU CAN'T FIX ME,
KILL ME.

28:58.083 --> 28:59.667
EVERYTHING WENT SMOOTHLY.
I GOT IT ALL.

28:59.709 --> 29:01.792
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:01.834 --> 29:03.041
WILL I...

29:03.083 --> 29:04.834
YOU NEED TIME.

29:06.083 --> 29:08.875
DR. TURNER.

29:08.917 --> 29:11.000
SO I'M GONNA CONTINUE
SEEING WHITNEY.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.000
AND YOU WILL CONTINUE
WITH DR. WALLACE.

29:13.041 --> 29:14.792
OF COURSE.
YOU CAN'T GO HOME YET.

29:14.834 --> 29:16.166
NOT UNTIL BOTH OF US AGREE

29:16.208 --> 29:18.125
THAT IT'S THE BEST THING
TO DO FOR YOUR FAMILY.

29:20.083 --> 29:21.625
THANK YOU...

29:21.667 --> 29:24.500
FOR GIVING ME A CHANCE.

29:26.792 --> 29:29.291
THINK YOU'RE READY
FOR A COUPLE OF VISITORS?

29:41.083 --> 29:44.041
I PROMISE, WHIT, I WILL
SPEND THE REST OF MY DAYS

29:44.083 --> 29:47.750
DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
TO EARN BACK YOUR TRUST.

29:47.792 --> 29:50.166
I REALLY HOPE I CAN.

29:59.792 --> 30:02.041
DR. TURNER,

30:02.083 --> 30:03.709
HOW'S...

30:03.750 --> 30:06.041
IS SHE OKAY?

30:06.083 --> 30:08.166
(mouths word)
SHE'S BRAVE

30:08.208 --> 30:12.000
AND SHE'S HOPEFUL.

30:13.750 --> 30:16.500
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

30:16.542 --> 30:19.041
YOU REALLY THINK
RICH WILL BE OKAY?

30:19.083 --> 30:22.041
I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT.

30:22.083 --> 30:23.709
I DID EVERYTHING I COULD,

30:23.750 --> 30:25.500
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO
EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN,

30:25.542 --> 30:27.834
AND THE ALTERNATIVE...

30:27.875 --> 30:29.875
IS TOO AWFUL TO CONTEMPLATE.

30:31.083 --> 30:33.166
WELL, SOMETIMES
THINGS WORK OUT,

30:33.208 --> 30:36.333
EVEN WHEN YOU DIDN'T THINK
THEY COULD.

30:36.375 --> 30:38.583
(people speaking indistinctly)

30:38.625 --> 30:40.000
AMELIA, ABOUT LAST NIGHT--

30:40.041 --> 30:41.792
I HAVE TO GO.

30:41.834 --> 30:44.709
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

30:44.750 --> 30:47.041
THIS PLACE BAFFLES ME.

30:47.083 --> 30:49.583
IT'S A BUNCH OF DOCTORS
STICKING THEIR NOSES

30:49.625 --> 30:51.625
IN PLACES
WHERE NOSES DON'T BELONG,

30:51.667 --> 30:55.291
OR AT LEAST PLACES I WOULD
NEVER THINK OF STICKING MINE.

30:55.333 --> 30:57.125
I MEAN, FOR FAMILY, YES,
FOR SOMEONE I LOVE,

30:57.166 --> 30:58.625
BUT THIS IS AN OFFICE.

30:58.667 --> 31:01.208
YEAH, BUT PEOPLE AROUND HERE,
W-WE ARE FAMILY.

31:01.250 --> 31:02.834
WE CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER.

31:02.875 --> 31:05.542
AND YOU OBVIOUSLY
CARE ABOUT AMELIA.

31:05.583 --> 31:07.375
OF COURSE I CARE,
BUT I'M NOT SURE

31:07.417 --> 31:10.458
BEING ALL UP IN HER BUSINESS
IS THE BEST WAY TO HELP.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.583
WELL, THEN DO IT YOUR WAY.

31:12.625 --> 31:13.792
(papers rustle)

31:13.834 --> 31:15.458
SO WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING HERE ANYWAY?

31:15.500 --> 31:18.041
OH, I AM JUST
FINISHING UP STUFF.

31:18.083 --> 31:20.417
WHO'S WATCHING YOUR BABY?

31:20.458 --> 31:21.959
SAM?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.041
SHUT UP.
(laughs)

31:24.083 --> 31:25.375
(laughs)
DON'T LAUGH AT ME.

31:25.417 --> 31:28.041
OH, IT'S NOT YOU
I'M LAUGHING AT.

31:28.083 --> 31:30.125
YOU'RE GETTING EVERYTHING
YOU WANTED, RIGHT?

31:30.166 --> 31:33.166
WELL, I DIDN'T...
THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THAT.

31:33.208 --> 31:35.792
WELL, ISN'T THIS WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN HOPING FOR?
