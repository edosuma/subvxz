GO WITH IT?

10:01.309 --> 10:03.894
IN A DIFFERENT WAY?

10:03.978 --> 10:05.938
CAN YOU PUT THAT ON HOLD
FOR ME?

10:06.022 --> 10:08.190
THANKS.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.527
- SO WHAT CONSEQUENCES
ARE YOU BUYING THEM NOW?

10:11.610 --> 10:14.613
- I KNOW A LOT OF WHAT
I AM DOING IS UNORTHODOX.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.241
- IS THAT THE NEW WORD
FOR "STUPID"?

10:17.325 --> 10:19.869
- YEAH, MAYBE,

10:19.952 --> 10:21.203
BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.540
I MEAN, I'VE GOT 38 OUT OF 50
PARENTS TELLING ME

10:24.623 --> 10:27.835
THAT <i> DOOM EXPLOSION</i> HELPS
IMPROVE A BOY'S I.Q.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.129
- HONEY, THOSE COULD ALL BE
PEOPLE WHO GET FRISKED

10:30.212 --> 10:31.839
BEFORE THEY VISIT THEIR KID.

10:31.922 --> 10:35.301
- THE TRUTH IS, THIS MIGHT BE
CROWDSOURCED WISDOM,

10:35.384 --> 10:38.220
BUT IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.222
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I REALLY ADMIRE ABOUT YOU?

10:40.306 --> 10:43.434
- WOW.
WHAT?

10:43.517 --> 10:45.478
- YOU CAN SAY
"CROWDSOURCED WISDOM"

10:45.561 --> 10:48.773
WITH A STRAIGHT FACE.

10:48.856 --> 10:52.651
HONEY, THERE IS ONLY ONE SOURCE
FOR REAL WISDOM.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.987
YOUR MAMA.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.155
COME ON.

10:56.238 --> 10:59.658
CHILDREN ARE LIKE COAL.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.243
YOU WANT TO TURN THEM
INTO DIAMONDS--

11:01.327 --> 11:02.119
YOU GOT TO PUT THEM
UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE

11:02.203 --> 11:07.208
FOR A LONG TIME.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.626
THEN YOU GOT TO START
CHIPPING AWAY AT THEM.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.502
YEP.
CHIP-CHIP-CHIPPING AWAY.

11:09.585 --> 11:13.381
NOW, IS THAT FUN
FOR THE DIAMOND?

11:13.464 --> 11:14.840
NOT SO MUCH.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.092
BUT IT'S ALL ON YOU,

11:16.175 --> 11:18.552
BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT
THE VILLAGE

11:18.636 --> 11:20.179
CHIPPING AWAY AT YOUR CHILD.

11:20.262 --> 11:24.141
THAT JUST MAKES
FOR SOME LOPSIDED CHILDREN.

11:24.225 --> 11:28.396
IT TAKES
ONE HIGHLY FOCUSED WOMAN

11:28.479 --> 11:31.273
SACRIFICING THE BEST YEARS

11:31.357 --> 11:33.317
OF HER LIFE

11:33.401 --> 11:35.986
WITHOUT COMPLAINT,

11:36.070 --> 11:40.157
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS
THAT HER CHILDREN WILL

11:40.241 --> 11:43.994
CARRY ON HER WISDOM,
UNCHANGED,

11:44.078 --> 11:46.789
FROM GENERATION
TO GENERATION.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.295
- MOM?

11:53.379 --> 11:55.131
I WANT TO THANK YOU.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.882
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

11:56.966 --> 11:57.925
- I WAS SORT OF WAVERING,

11:58.008 --> 12:00.136
BUT NOW I AM CERTAIN
I NEED TO GET

12:00.219 --> 12:04.473
ALL OF MY PARENTING ADVICE
FROM THE INTERNET.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.933
- CLEARLY, I'M NOT DONE
CHIPPING YET.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.943
- WE HAVE TO PUT
THE LAPTOP BACK.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.319
TYPE FASTER.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.905
- HEY, IT'S NOT EASY
BEING 38 DIFFERENT PARENTS.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.533
- WHY NOT?
THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING.

12:22.616 --> 12:25.619
- YOU TRY SAYING THE SAME THING
38 DIFFERENT WAYS.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.164
- OKAY.
ONE: WE'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.874
TWO: THEY'RE GONNA CATCH US.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.418
THREE: GETTING CAUGHT
IS GONNA HAPPEN

12:32.501 --> 12:34.962
TO US.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.672
FOUR--

12:36.755 --> 12:38.841
- THIS TIME, YOU'RE GONNA
BE DEAD PERMANENTLY.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.468
- UH, SORRY.
WHAT?

12:40.551 --> 12:43.679
- THIS WAS TAPED
TO MY LOCKER

12:43.762 --> 12:45.181
BECAUSE YOU TOLD YOUR FRIEND

12:45.264 --> 12:46.474
AND HE TOLD HIS BROTHER
FROM REMEDIAL ENGLISH,

12:46.557 --> 12:47.850
AND NOW THERE'S ALL THESE JOKES

12:47.933 --> 12:52.938
ABOUT ME IN THE BATHROOM,
MISSPELLED.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.733
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M VERY SORRY.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.486
- FINE.

12:58.569 --> 12:59.778
WAIT.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.530
THOSE ARE FIVE WORDS
I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU SAY.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.698
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

13:02.781 --> 13:03.991
- NOTHING.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.451
- MOVE.
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?

13:05.534 --> 13:07.328
GET OUT THE WAY.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.497
IS THAT STEPHANIE'S COMPUTER?

13:09.580 --> 13:10.623
- WE CAN MAKE YOU
A FULL PARTNER.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.541
- IT COMES WITH ICE CREAM.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.586
-<i> HOW NOT TO BE AN EVIL...</i>

13:15.669 --> 13:17.046
OH, WOW.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.923
STEPHANIE TOLD
THE ENTIRE INTERNET

13:19.006 --> 13:20.883
ABOUT MY HAIRY LEGS.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.426
YOU KNOW WHAT--
I'M GONNA HAVE A TALK

13:22.510 --> 13:23.886
WITH MY EVIL STEPMOM.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.180
- GABBY, WAIT.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.765
HEAR ME OUT.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.976
THAT LAPTOP IS THE GOOSE
THAT LAYS THE GOLDEN EGGS--

13:31.060 --> 13:32.394
"EXTRA TV" EGGS,

13:32.478 --> 13:33.729
"STAY UP LATE" EGGS.

13:33.812 --> 13:36.565
- "ICE CREAM" EGGS.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.985
- SO HOW DO YOU WANT YOUR EGGS?

13:40.069 --> 13:42.363
- SMASHED.

13:42.446 --> 13:45.866
- THAT'S NOT A WAY.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.537
- ALL RIGHT, SO...

13:49.620 --> 13:53.499
PRETTY OR PRISSY?

13:53.582 --> 13:55.918
- IT'S PRETTY
WHERE IT WANTS TO BE

13:56.001 --> 13:59.588
AND PRISSY
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.757
- NICELY PLAYED.

14:01.840 --> 14:02.216
- HI, HI--

14:02.299 --> 14:05.135
HI?

14:05.219 --> 14:06.929
- WHAT ARE YOU
ALL DRESSED UP FOR?

14:07.012 --> 14:08.264
- I'M TAKING GABBY
TO THE TEA.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.724
- OUR TEA?

14:10.808 --> 14:12.851
WHA--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.019
GABBY!

14:14.103 --> 14:15.521
- GABBY TOLD ME
THAT YOU HAD A JOB INTERVIEW.

14:15.604 --> 14:20.192
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUSPICIOUS.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.485
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:21.569 --> 14:23.195
- I'M GOING
WITH GRANDMA MAGGIE INSTEAD.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.905
- WHAT?

14:24.989 --> 14:27.241
- GABBY, I REALLY WANTED
TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.784
- YEAH?

14:28.867 --> 14:30.035
WELL, YOU'RE VERY GOOD
AT SHARING, AREN'T YOU?

14:30.119 --> 14:32.621
- IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO ME,

14:32.705 --> 14:33.789
YOU SHOULD JUST SAY IT.

14:33.872 --> 14:34.957
- REALLY?

14:35.040 --> 14:36.625
WELL, I THINK
IF I HAD SOMETHING PERSONAL

14:36.709 --> 14:37.960
TO SAY ABOUT PEOPLE
IN MY FAMILY,

14:38.043 --> 14:41.255
I WOULD JUST WRITE IT
ON MY BLOG.

14:41.338 --> 14:45.384
COME ON, GRANDMA MAGGIE.
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.344
- IF IT'S OF ANY CONSOLATION,

14:47.428 --> 14:51.140
AIN'T NOBODY CALLING YOU
"GRANDMA."

14:51.223 --> 14:52.975
- I--I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.560
- SHE READ YOUR BLOG.

14:54.643 --> 14:57.187
- I GOT THAT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.147
- UH, MAYBE BECAUSE IT WAS--

14:58.230 --> 15:00.357
I DON'T KNOW--
ON THE INTERNET?

15:00.441 --> 15:02.651
- HONEY, IT'S ANONYMOUS.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.486
MY NAME ISN'T ON IT.
HER NAME ISN'T ON IT.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.821
I WAS SO CAREFUL.

15:05.904 --> 15:09.199
THE ONLY WAY
ANYONE COULD KNOW IS...

15:09.283 --> 15:12.494
IS THAT ICE CREAM?

15:12.578 --> 15:15.539
- NO, IT'S EVIDENCE.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.915
THE BOYS...

15:16.999 --> 15:18.083
IN THE PARLOR...

15:18.167 --> 15:21.587
WITH MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.464
- HOW COULD I MISS IT?

15:23.547 --> 15:29.219
38 PARENTS WHO ALL THINK
<i>DOOM EXPLOSION</i> IS EDUCATIONAL.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.013
WELL...

15:31.096 --> 15:33.307
THEY SCHOOLED ME.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.184
I'LL SCHOOL THEM.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.354
- I'M TELLING YOU--
THE INTERNET IS NOT A SAFE PLACE

15:38.437 --> 15:40.356
FOR GROWN-UPS
TO GO BY THEMSELVES.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.319
- I'M HUNGRY FOR A SNACK,

15:45.402 --> 15:46.987
BUT I'M TIRED
OF ICE CREAM SUNDAES.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.531
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK
FOR STEAK.

15:49.615 --> 15:53.952
- I'VE BEEN HEARING GOOD THINGS
ABOUT LOBSTER.

15:54.036 --> 15:57.206
UH-OH, ONE OF MY FAKE NAMES
JUST GOT AN EMAIL.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.708
- SO WHAT?
HE DOESN'T EXIST.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.586
- BUT THE FEDERAL
INTERNET AGENCY THINKS HE DOES.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.796
- WHO'S THAT?

16:03.879 --> 16:04.838
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT THEY'RE MAD AT US.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.257
[email notification pinging]

16:07.341 --> 16:10.219
OH, NO, WE ARE IN A PANT-LOAD
OF TROUBLE.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.804
[knocking at door]

16:11.887 --> 16:13.347
- BOYS!

16:13.430 --> 16:14.723
THERE ARE TWO MEN DOWNSTAIRS

16:14.807 --> 16:16.475
FROM THE FEDERAL
INTERNET AGENCY.

16:16.558 --> 16:17.726
- WHAT?

16:17.810 --> 16:18.769
- YEAH,
THEY WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.270
- CAN YOU TELL THEM
WE'RE NOT HERE?

16:20.354 --> 16:23.065
- IT'S TOO LATE.
THEY SAW YOU COME IN.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.526
BOYS, ARE YOU AWARE
THAT CREATING EMAILS

16:25.609 --> 16:27.444
UNDER A FALSE NAME
IS A FEDERAL CRIME

16:27.528 --> 16:33.367
PUNISHABLE BY UP TO 15 YEARS
IN A MAXIMUM-SECURITY PRISON?

16:33.450 --> 16:36.453
- WE ARE NOW.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.913
- WHAT ARE THEY GONNA
DO TO US?

16:37.996 --> 16:38.664
- THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
THROWING THE BOOK AT YOU.

16:38.747 --> 16:41.250
- HOW BIG IS THIS BOOK?

16:41.333 --> 16:43.252
- SHE MEANS WE'RE GONNA GO
TO THE BIG HOUSE.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.754
- HOW BIG IS THIS HOUSE?

16:45.838 --> 16:48.006
- YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL.

16:50.801 --> 16:54.888
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO TELL ME?

16:54.972 --> 16:56.598
- I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE DOING
ANYTHING AGAINST THE LAW.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.433
I JUST WANTED TO GET OUT
OF A PUNISHMENT,

16:57.516 --> 16:58.851
AND I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

16:58.934 --> 17:02.396
- I DON'T WANT TO GO TO PRISON.
IT WAS JAMES' IDEA.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.939
- OKAY, LISTEN.

17:04.021 --> 17:07.443
I'M SURE YOU BOYS
THOUGHT THIS WAS FUNNY,

17:07.526 --> 17:10.194
BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THAT WHAT YOU DO ON THE INTERNET

17:10.279 --> 17:12.573
HAS CONSEQUENCES
IN REAL LIFE.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.532
- DO YOU THINK THE AGENTS
WILL GO EASY ON US

17:14.616 --> 17:16.617
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST STUPID KIDS?

17:16.702 --> 17:17.953
- WE'LL SEE.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.373
MAYBE I CAN TALK THEM
INTO SOME KIND OF HOUSE ARREST.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.000
- THANKS, STEPHANIE.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.381
- I SURE HOPE
SHE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT.

17:29.465 --> 17:30.716
I CAN'T DO HARD TIME.

17:30.799 --> 17:31.717
- ME NEITHER.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.218
I GOT SCHOOL.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.600
[knocking at door]

17:39.683 --> 17:41.769
- COME IN.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.103
- HOW WAS YOUR TEA?

17:43.187 --> 17:47.816
- WHY?
DO YOU WANT TO BLOG ABOUT IT?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.485
- GABBY, I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW BAD I FEEL ABOUT THIS.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.153
- TRY.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.656
- I TRULY THOUGHT
THE BLOG WOULD BE ANONYMOUS.

17:54.740 --> 17:55.991
- EVEN IF IT WAS,

17:56.074 --> 17:58.744
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
OF YOU WRITING ABOUT ME AT ALL.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.370
- I WASN'T WRITING ABOUT YOU.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.039
I WAS WRITING ABOUT ME.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.749
- THAT'S FUNNY--
I DIDN'T SEE YOUR NAME COME UP

18:03.832 --> 18:05.167
ON THE BATHROOM WALL.

18:05.250 --> 18:10.172
YOU KNOW, YOU'D THINK THAT IDIOT
COULD SPELL "GABBY" RIGHT.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.757
- LOOK, HONEY, I WAS TRYING
TO GET HELP FROM OTHER PARENTS

18:11.840 --> 18:13.967
TO BE A BETTER STEPMOM.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.553
- YEAH, BUT IT INVOLVED ME.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.181
AND YOU SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT
PEOPLE BEHIND THEIR BACKS.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.684
- SO WHEN YOU'RE WITH
YOUR FRIENDS,

18:22.768 --> 18:25.687
YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT ME?

18:25.771 --> 18:29.483
- WELL, YEAH.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.276
BUT...

18:31.360 --> 18:34.029
OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH.

18:34.112 --> 18:36.031
- YOU KNOW,
YOUR GRANDMA MAGGIE,

18:36.115 --> 18:40.994
IN BETWEEN ALL THE...
[mumbling]

18:41.078 --> 18:44.164
EVERY NOW AND THEN,
SHE GETS IT RIGHT.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.333
SHE USED TO TELL ME,
"WHEN YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING

18:46.416 --> 18:48.210
"BEHIND SOMEBODY'S BACK,

18:48.293 --> 18:52.214
THINK ABOUT HOW IT WOULD FEEL
TO SAY IT TO THEIR FACE."

18:52.297 --> 18:54.299
- THAT'S GOOD ADVICE,
BUT YOU SHOULD HEAR

18:54.383 --> 18:57.553
SOME OF THE THINGS
THAT SHE SAYS ABOUT YOU.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.303
- I DO.

18:58.387 --> 19:02.641
SHE SAYS THEM TO MY FACE.

19:02.724 --> 19:03.767
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--

19:03.851 --> 19:04.893
I'LL KEEP WRITING
MY STEPMOM BLOG.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.688
ONLY, I'M GONNA OWN IT

19:07.771 --> 19:09.231
WITH MY NAME.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.732
THAT'LL MAKE ME
A LOT MORE CAREFUL

19:10.816 --> 19:13.151
ABOUT WHAT I PUT OUT THERE.

19:13.235 --> 19:17.281
- I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.408
OH, THERE'S GONNA BE
CONSEQUENCES

19:19.491 --> 19:20.534
FOR THE BOYS, RIGHT?

19:20.617 --> 19:21.660
- NO.
THEY'RE GETTING PUNISHED.

19:21.743 --> 19:23.620
- UPSIDE THE HEAD?

19:23.704 --> 19:25.372
- UPSIDE THE HEAD.

19:32.170 --> 19:33.297
- I'M TIRED.
I WANT TO STOP.

19:33.380 --> 19:36.091
- WE CAN'T
UNTIL THEY TELL US.

19:36.174 --> 19:36.800
THIS IS THE DEAL STEPHANIE GOT.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.802
IT'S THIS

19:38.886 --> 19:40.721
OR 15 YEARS
IN FEDERAL PRISON.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.267
- MAN, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN
SO MUCH WORSE.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.268
GOOD THING WE HAVE STEPHANIE.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.980
- YEAH,
SHE REALLY LOOKS OUT FOR US.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.194
- DID YOU PUT THE BOYS TO BED?

19:56.278 --> 19:57.195
- NO.

19:57.279 --> 20:01.491
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA DO IT.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.201
YOU THINK
THEY'RE STILL CLEANING?

20:03.285 --> 20:04.912
- WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND CHECK?

20:04.995 --> 20:07.831
- BUT I JUST GOT WARM.

20:09.708 --> 20:13.378
BESIDES, THESE CONSEQUENCES
ARE YOUR IDEA.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.797
- I GOT CREAM ON MY FEET.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.466
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

20:17.549 --> 20:18.467
- [sighs]

20:18.550 --> 20:20.260
WELL, TOMORROW IS SATURDAY.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.015
GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.
