00:01.610 --> 00:03.264
Previously
on "Billy The Kid"...

00:04.874 --> 00:06.441
Billy,

00:06.571 --> 00:08.486
please promise me that
you'll never hurt Antrim.

00:08.617 --> 00:12.229
I really hate myself, Billy.
I always have!

00:12.360 --> 00:14.144
You know what they do
to people who...

00:18.888 --> 00:20.846
What is it
you want to be, Billy?

00:20.977 --> 00:23.240
You can't work tables
and play poker forever.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.895
Hey, Jesse, how do you
earn a living?

00:26.026 --> 00:29.246
I do a little cattle rustling.
You wanna come try?

00:29.377 --> 00:30.813
-No.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.945
Is he gonna die?
Is my son gonna die?

00:33.076 --> 00:35.470
Your son is suffering
from consumption.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.254
Why don't you
come out with us?

00:37.385 --> 00:39.387
And you can make
some real money.

00:39.517 --> 00:40.866
I'll take care of you.

00:40.997 --> 00:42.433
Yah! Yah!

00:42.564 --> 00:44.435
Yah! Yah!

00:44.566 --> 00:46.002
-My poor boy.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.700
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Kathleen.

00:48.831 --> 00:51.703
Everything that's happened,
do you think it's been worth it?

00:51.834 --> 00:53.444
-Do we have any choice?
-No.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.446
I don't think we have a choice.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.448
-What is it?
-It's the same disease

00:57.579 --> 00:58.710
that carried away your brother.

00:58.841 --> 01:02.758
I have to go, Billy.
You have to let me.

01:02.888 --> 01:08.285
I've looked in your soul,
and I know how good you are.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.635
I'm really sorry, Billy.
First thing,

01:10.766 --> 01:12.333
you gotta get money.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.770
Come on. Let's get
outta here, Jesse.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.337
-Billy, come on!

01:17.642 --> 01:19.557
The Santa Fe ring
run most things

01:19.688 --> 01:20.993
out here in the West, Billy.

01:21.124 --> 01:23.605
I'm investigating
the whole damn system.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.563
They buy judges, they buy anyone
they damn well please.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.870
They get rid of people
who stand in their way.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.002
We find
the defendant guilty

01:30.133 --> 01:32.396
and sentenced
to three years in jail.

01:32.527 --> 01:33.876
Shame on you, Judge.

01:34.006 --> 01:36.313
Make a kid pay
for the things I've done?

01:37.880 --> 01:39.751
Antrim!

02:04.080 --> 02:05.125
Billy!

02:09.477 --> 02:10.608
You're alive.

03:37.739 --> 03:43.614
Who the hell...are you?

03:43.745 --> 03:46.313
My name's Billy Antrim.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.666
Just passing through.
I didn't mean to intrude.

03:51.796 --> 03:54.234
What the hell are you
doin' riding up here?

03:56.627 --> 03:58.063
Hmm?

03:58.194 --> 04:01.328
I just broke outta jail.

04:03.547 --> 04:06.855
That has gotta be...

04:06.985 --> 04:11.425
the best excuse I ever heard
for being anywhere.

04:18.997 --> 04:20.782
What's your name?

04:24.699 --> 04:25.917
Alias.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.399
That's my name.

04:35.318 --> 04:39.061
Every time I got arrested,
I gave 'em a different name.

04:39.191 --> 04:45.154
And they kept asking,
"Are you using an alias?"

04:45.285 --> 04:47.765
And it made perfect sense
to me to just say,

04:47.896 --> 04:51.116
"Yes. Exactly.

04:51.247 --> 04:56.426
I'm using an alias...
'cause that's my name."

05:19.144 --> 05:21.973
Why'd you get arrested?

05:33.985 --> 05:39.034
I just...don't like the law.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.836
You think I was gonna kill you?

06:00.664 --> 06:05.582
If I was, you'd already be dead.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.980
I'm just playin'.

06:15.026 --> 06:17.115
Hmm.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.904
So now you're outta jail...

06:23.034 --> 06:24.514
Where you planning on going?

06:26.168 --> 06:29.476
It just so happens
I'm on the move, too.

06:29.606 --> 06:32.174
I was thinking of heading back
into Texas, pick up some work.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.697
If you can rope and ride,

06:33.828 --> 06:35.743
them ranches don't care
about nothin' else.

06:35.873 --> 06:39.442
Maybe you wanna...string along?

06:39.573 --> 06:44.186
You're an outlaw now, boy.
You ain't got a lot of options.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.673
Whoa.

07:03.335 --> 07:10.604
Remember, you ain't
Billy Antrim no more.

07:15.826 --> 07:19.917
Good to see ya.
How ya been?

07:21.876 --> 07:24.008
Same as usual, Mr. Hooker?

07:24.139 --> 07:26.576
Of course.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.070
Evening, sir.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.638
You remember me,
don't you, Mr. Hooker, sir?

07:44.768 --> 07:48.163
'Course I do. Mr. Alias.

07:48.293 --> 07:51.949
I'm always surprised
to see you still at liberty...

07:52.080 --> 07:54.735
which I suppose
is to your credit.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.738
Thank you, sir.

07:57.868 --> 08:00.697
I assume
you're looking for work.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.830
Yes, sir. I am.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.746
As a matter of fact,
I have a young friend with me

08:05.876 --> 08:08.792
who's also in need
of daily sustenance.

08:11.186 --> 08:14.058
Good evening, Mr. Hooker, sir.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.586
My name is William H. Bonney.

08:21.849 --> 08:25.896
Where are you from?

08:26.027 --> 08:28.377
I was raised in Kansas.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.292
My father was a carpenter.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.337
I always had a hankering
to be a cowboy.

08:32.468 --> 08:35.340
I have family in Kansas.

08:35.471 --> 08:38.039
You don't sound
like you come from Kansas.

08:38.169 --> 08:45.263
That's because my family
came here from Ireland, sir.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.876
That right?

08:49.006 --> 08:51.661
They came here as immigrants.

08:53.968 --> 08:56.144
How long have you known
Mr. Alias?

08:56.274 --> 08:58.799
Long enough, sir.

08:58.929 --> 09:00.888
We shared a room together
in Pueblo

09:01.018 --> 09:04.152
when we were
breaking in some horses.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.720
Ever killed anyone?

09:11.855 --> 09:16.599
Not yet...sir.

09:16.730 --> 09:20.821
Well, we get plenty of rustlers
stealing my property.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.126
You can't argue with them.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.172
Sometimes, you just
gotta shoot 'em.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.831
Could you do that?

09:30.961 --> 09:33.834
Sure, I could.

09:37.141 --> 09:42.277
Sing me a song, William Bonney,
if you really are Irish.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.409
I'm not sure about that.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.237
Sure, you are.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.947
What would you like to hear?

10:02.906 --> 10:05.822
Somethin' fuckin' Irish.

11:15.239 --> 11:21.202
Well, I guess I got
two new cowboys.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.563
-Well, sir?
-Whiskey.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.913
-Don't mind if I do.
-Double, please.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.437
This one's on me.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.980
-Good morning, Billy.

12:00.110 --> 12:04.332
Morning.

12:04.462 --> 12:05.986
Alice.

12:06.116 --> 12:09.163
-I know.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.884
Git up!

12:36.320 --> 12:38.105
Yah!

12:38.235 --> 12:39.410
Whoo!

12:41.978 --> 12:44.198
Whoo!

12:48.158 --> 12:49.290
I've been thinking...

12:49.420 --> 12:53.033
Hooker does a bunch
of horse-thieving on the side.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.252
He pays guys like us to do it.

12:55.383 --> 12:59.213
We take all the risk.
He takes all the money.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.911
You ain't satisfied
working for Mr. Hooker?

13:02.042 --> 13:04.044
Billy, Billy...

13:04.174 --> 13:08.135
Only monkeys work
for peanuts, son.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.311
Hooker's made a very
comfortable life for himself.

13:10.441 --> 13:15.055
And I? I want a part of it.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.579
There's a bunch of new horses
up at Camp Grant.

13:17.709 --> 13:22.018
This time, we'll take
the horses without him.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.978
What if he finds out?

13:26.544 --> 13:29.939
Not gonna let me down,
are you?

13:36.163 --> 13:38.121
After everything
I've done for you?

13:41.559 --> 13:44.475
Good.

14:23.384 --> 14:26.039
We've got three minutes
between guards. In and out.

14:45.275 --> 14:48.888
Come on, Billy. Gotta go!

15:20.528 --> 15:21.529
Morning.

15:21.659 --> 15:25.011
Yeah.
What can I do for you, boy?

15:25.141 --> 15:27.578
I was hoping you might be able
to put some new shoes on him.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.334
How come a young fellow like you

15:44.465 --> 15:46.336
got such a fine young horse
like this?

15:46.467 --> 15:49.165
-I bought him.
-Who from?

15:49.296 --> 15:52.386
I know all the dealers
around here.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.692
I bought him down in New Mexico.

15:54.823 --> 15:55.650
Oh.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.267
He was branded.

16:07.053 --> 16:12.406
I heard some horses got stolen
up at Camp Grant.

16:12.536 --> 16:16.323
Did you steal him, boy?
You steal him from the Army?

16:16.453 --> 16:19.021
See, I'm ex-Army myself.

16:22.546 --> 16:26.159
We used to shoot horse thieves.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.683
And I told you...

16:28.813 --> 16:30.467
I bought him down
in New Mexico.

16:30.598 --> 16:33.514
Listen, if you don't want
the business...

16:33.644 --> 16:35.168
Who said I didn't want it?

16:45.787 --> 16:47.267
What's your name?

16:47.397 --> 16:49.486
William H. Bonney.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.774
It's just me.

17:18.776 --> 17:21.257
What are you doing?

17:22.954 --> 17:24.217
Watching you sleep.

17:24.347 --> 17:27.394
Like a baby.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.135
Why?

17:30.788 --> 17:34.183
'Cause I'm leaving.

17:34.314 --> 17:36.142
Now?

17:36.272 --> 17:37.360
Yep.

17:37.491 --> 17:40.798
Me and Hooker fell out.

17:40.929 --> 17:44.715
He found out. So I shot him.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.587
That's why I'm moving on.

18:06.389 --> 18:07.303
Here's my girl.

18:12.874 --> 18:17.661
Well, well, if it ain't
Mr. William H. Bonney.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.796
I still reckon
you stole that horse.

18:26.931 --> 18:30.761
Hope you folks don't mind
playing with a horse thief!

18:30.892 --> 18:33.938
I told you
I ain't no horse thief.

18:34.069 --> 18:37.333
You! Why don't you shut
your fool mouth?

18:37.464 --> 18:40.293
Or what?

18:40.423 --> 18:43.644
Huh? Fucking darkie?

18:43.774 --> 18:46.473
All right, gentlemen.
Settle down. Settle down.

18:46.603 --> 18:47.648
Come on! Come on!

18:47.778 --> 18:51.260
-Hey! Settle down.
-Hey.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.570
What've you got against me?

18:56.700 --> 18:59.355
Nothin'.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.792
Well, then, do as he says.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.403
Shut your mouth.

19:03.533 --> 19:06.536
How about you just
leave this town?

19:06.667 --> 19:09.931
I've got as much a right to be
here as you do, Mr. Cahill.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.585
It's a free country.

19:11.715 --> 19:14.762
You're a horse-thief
and a liar, boy.

19:20.071 --> 19:23.858
-Stop it! Stop it!

19:37.132 --> 19:38.394
Billy?

20:04.551 --> 20:07.380
We all saw.

20:07.510 --> 20:08.816
It wasn't your fault.

20:17.564 --> 20:18.869
You might like
to get outta here.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.511
Ma...

21:37.731 --> 21:38.775
I need to speak to you.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.389
I killed a man.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.003
I didn't mean to.

21:51.222 --> 21:53.312
I had no choice.

21:59.709 --> 22:03.713
I don't know if I can ask
for forgiveness.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.324
Maybe not.

22:07.717 --> 22:09.632
Ma, I know what you'd say.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.463
Can't run away from it.

22:24.865 --> 22:29.783
Can't pretend it never happened.

22:31.567 --> 22:32.916
I have to go back.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.358
Tell the truth.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.884
Face the consequences.

22:57.637 --> 22:58.855
Is that what you think?

23:06.689 --> 23:11.128
My name is William H. Bonney.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.653
I'm here to talk to you
about the death

23:13.783 --> 23:17.396
of Francis P. Cahill,
the blacksmith.

23:17.526 --> 23:20.703
William H. Bonney,
you have been arrested

23:20.834 --> 23:22.662
for the foul murder
of the blacksmith

23:22.792 --> 23:25.578
known to us all as Windy Cahill.
How do you plead?

23:25.708 --> 23:29.233
It wasn't murder.

23:29.364 --> 23:31.105
It was self-defense.

23:31.235 --> 23:33.890
Mr. Cahill attacked me.

23:34.021 --> 23:36.066
And somehow,
during the struggle,

23:36.197 --> 23:40.984
I got a hold of the gun,
and it just went off.

23:41.115 --> 23:46.076
I swear on my mother's grave,
I never meant to kill him.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.209
I'm afraid your guilt
is already established,

23:48.339 --> 23:50.298
Mr. Bonney,
due to your previous conviction

23:50.429 --> 23:52.605
for armed robbery in Silver City

23:52.735 --> 23:55.042
and your unlawful escape
from jail.

23:55.172 --> 23:59.263
Ask any of the witnesses
in that saloon,

23:59.394 --> 24:02.702
and you will know the truth.

24:02.832 --> 24:03.790
Sir.

24:06.401 --> 24:09.273
My family came to America...

24:09.404 --> 24:12.320
on the promise of...

24:12.451 --> 24:16.672
just and fair treatment for all.

24:16.803 --> 24:19.196
And I came back here today...

24:23.984 --> 24:26.552
...because I want to believe
that promise.

24:30.904 --> 24:32.253
You are arraigned for trial.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.821
In the meantime,
for the safety of the public,

24:34.951 --> 24:36.910
I order you placed
in the guardhouse

24:37.040 --> 24:40.740
under surveillance until
you are brought to justice.

24:56.451 --> 24:57.931
There he is!

24:58.061 --> 25:00.673
He killed Windy! Murderer!

25:00.803 --> 25:02.370
You'll rot in jail, kid!

25:02.501 --> 25:04.154
Hang him, Sheriff!

25:04.285 --> 25:05.329
Hang him, Sheriff!

25:05.460 --> 25:07.723
Billy! Billy!

25:07.854 --> 25:08.898
Hang him, Sheriff!

25:09.029 --> 25:12.902
Leave the prisoner alone, Miss!

25:13.033 --> 25:14.251
You're going to hell, son!

25:14.382 --> 25:15.688
Hang him!

26:07.087 --> 26:08.871
Sir, you can't go any closer.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.438
I'm a certified journalist.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.919
I'm here to see the prisoner.

26:13.049 --> 26:15.182
You're a man of the law.
Surely you aren't intending

26:15.312 --> 26:20.753
to infringe upon the freedom
of the press, are you?

26:20.883 --> 26:23.799
Let me have your gun.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.116
Mr. Upson. What the hell
are you doing here?

26:36.246 --> 26:38.901
I have ears everywhere, Billy.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.860
Well, it's nice to see
a friendly face.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.340
I had no choice, Mr. Upson.

26:43.471 --> 26:47.040
I would never kill
in cold blood.

26:47.170 --> 26:51.000
They wanna try you for murder.
They're all corrupt.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.959
They're not interested
in the truth.

26:53.089 --> 26:55.788
I'm not layin' down, Mr. Upson.

26:55.918 --> 26:57.485
I'm gonna find a way outta here.

26:57.616 --> 27:01.750
I don't doubt that
for a minute.

27:01.881 --> 27:06.407
But when you do...

27:06.537 --> 27:08.801
you'll have an eye
over your shoulder,

27:08.931 --> 27:11.281
a gun in your hand.

27:11.412 --> 27:13.501
From here on out,
they'll call you a murderer.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.069
-I'm no murderer.
-No.

27:16.199 --> 27:20.421
No. You are a good
and a decent person, Billy.

27:20.551 --> 27:23.380
Wherever you go from here...

27:23.511 --> 27:27.167
never forget that.

27:35.915 --> 27:38.178
Will you do me one thing?

27:38.308 --> 27:43.792
Find Alice at the saloon
and just tell her...

27:43.923 --> 27:45.185
thank you.

27:50.233 --> 27:53.846
This won't be
our last meeting, Mr. Upson.

27:53.976 --> 27:56.152
Damn sure.

30:46.583 --> 30:49.325
Horse.

30:59.466 --> 31:02.686
I don't need that stuff!
I just need my horse!

31:02.817 --> 31:06.125
Please don't take him!
I'll die out here!

31:06.255 --> 31:09.693
You and your people have taken
all of our lands.

31:09.824 --> 31:14.089
In return, I do not take
your life, only your horse.

33:54.989 --> 33:56.208
Billy.

33:59.341 --> 34:00.342
-Billy.

34:03.432 --> 34:05.391
Billy. Billy.

34:10.526 --> 34:12.137
-Billy?
-What?

34:20.667 --> 34:22.277
Billy?

34:22.408 --> 34:23.670
-What?
-Hey.

34:23.800 --> 34:27.456
-It's okay, Billy.

34:35.334 --> 34:37.597
Who are you?

34:37.727 --> 34:39.642
My name's Barbara.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.731
Barbara Jones.

34:43.342 --> 34:45.692
How do you know who I am?

34:45.822 --> 34:47.650
I don't understand.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.872
-Where am I?
-New Mexico.

34:52.002 --> 34:56.268
Hey, you're...
you're still pretty sick.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.709
I'm gonna feed you up
and get you well again.

35:02.839 --> 35:05.581
Barbara?

35:07.322 --> 35:08.193
Yeah.

35:08.323 --> 35:12.675
I'm tired.

35:12.806 --> 35:15.852
Then sleep.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.419
So this is Lincoln County.

36:00.549 --> 36:02.943
Just outside Fort Stanton.

36:03.073 --> 36:06.425
This your place?

36:06.555 --> 36:08.949
No.

36:09.079 --> 36:11.995
We just...kinda occupy it.

36:12.126 --> 36:13.301
It was empty.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.651
Who's "we"?

36:18.088 --> 36:22.528
I run with a group called
the Seven River Gang.

36:22.658 --> 36:25.618
The boys are away,
rustling herds.

36:27.620 --> 36:30.536
That enough for you?

36:32.886 --> 36:35.584
Yeah, I guess.

36:35.715 --> 36:38.370
What am I doing here?

36:38.500 --> 36:40.023
I don't remember much,

36:40.154 --> 36:45.594
apart from the trail
and coyotes, and...

36:45.725 --> 36:47.335
when my horse got stolen.

36:49.946 --> 36:52.558
One of the boys found you
on the trail.

36:52.688 --> 36:54.516
You were flat out,
and like to die, he said,

36:54.647 --> 36:58.390
but recognized you and...

36:58.520 --> 37:00.392
brought you here.

37:00.522 --> 37:02.698
How'd he recognize me?

37:02.829 --> 37:07.921
You don't even know
how famous you are.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.706
There are "Wanted" posters
for you all over the state.

37:19.715 --> 37:21.500
And you don't mind me
being here?

37:21.630 --> 37:25.155
I hang out with outlaws.
I like outlaws.

37:25.286 --> 37:29.508
They're dangerous
but...exciting to be around.

37:32.728 --> 37:36.254
I admire their point of view,
and mostly I share it.

37:41.607 --> 37:44.479
My folks were Calvinists.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.264
Worshippers of the devil.

37:48.875 --> 37:53.880
I couldn't wait...
to escape and be free.

37:56.012 --> 38:00.408
My folks, back in Ireland,
were called...

38:00.539 --> 38:03.455
Rebels.

38:03.585 --> 38:07.937
Against the British.

38:08.068 --> 38:11.419
They couldn't wait
to escape here...

38:11.550 --> 38:12.855
to America.

38:17.599 --> 38:21.386
They wanted to be free, too.

38:24.563 --> 38:27.827
You and I, Billy...

38:27.957 --> 38:30.743
we're part of the same tribe.

38:36.705 --> 38:39.969
How long are your boys
gonna be away?

38:47.890 --> 38:51.329
Another week or so, I guess.

41:19.433 --> 41:21.653
They're back.

41:58.864 --> 42:00.648
Billy, I'm sorry.

42:03.825 --> 42:05.653
Billy?
