00:04.672 --> 00:07.441
This is good, Lyn.
You did good.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.009
I'll be right there.

00:09.076 --> 00:10.644
The baby... it's coming.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.113
I'm just looking out
for my girl.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.748
"My girl"?

00:14.014 --> 00:16.150
- I don't want to see you.
- He took advantage of her!

00:16.217 --> 00:17.385
MR. SANCHEZ:
She is not welcome here.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.086
Wash her out!

00:21.255 --> 00:23.190
The husband is still alive.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.459
Vidalia died still being
married to that man.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.128
EDDY: Do the girls know
he's not dead?

00:27.194 --> 00:29.063
ZOE: Mon Chou Chou!

00:29.130 --> 00:30.331
NICO: She's my ex.
Things are done with us.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.032
I like you, Emma.

00:32.099 --> 00:34.034
And you like me too.

Babe!
Listen to this.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.727
"Vida seems to have
materialized overnight

03:13.794 --> 03:19.567
into the epicenter of LA's
Latinx SoundCloud generation"!

03:19.633 --> 03:21.502
- What is that?

03:21.569 --> 03:23.737
It's, like, a legit review
from Saturday.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.806
Absolute rave.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.442
"This neighborhood haunt

03:28.509 --> 03:31.679
"is quickly reclaiming itself
as a local fixture

03:31.745 --> 03:35.349
with a reach well beyond
the Sixth Street Bridge."

03:35.416 --> 03:36.650
Do you die?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.252
I'm so happy for you, babe.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.654
I know, right?

03:40.721 --> 03:42.222
And this is just the beginning.

03:42.289 --> 03:43.857
Wait until I send them
a press release

03:43.924 --> 03:46.694
of everything
that I have planned.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.596
I am going to make Vida

03:48.662 --> 03:51.699
into the spot
of what's happening

03:51.765 --> 03:54.268
and now in Latinx culture.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.502
Oh, my God, feel my heart.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.371
Doesn't it feel like
I just did a superset?

03:59.406 --> 04:02.009
Mm.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.877
- I'm so proud of you.
- Aww.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.549
So proud
that I want to show you off.

04:08.616 --> 04:11.318
That's funny.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.787
Because being shown off
is one of my favorite things.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.723
Do you want to be shown off

04:15.789 --> 04:18.459
at my mother's
birthday party, tonight?

04:18.525 --> 04:19.593
Mm.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.330
Well, okay, not show you off,

04:23.397 --> 04:28.268
but is it too soon to bring you
to a family thing like that?

04:28.335 --> 04:31.372
I-I know that--
well, you made it clear

04:31.438 --> 04:33.641
that you don't want me
to call you my girl,

04:33.707 --> 04:35.709
and I know that we haven't
had the whole talk

04:35.776 --> 04:37.044
about what we're doing,

04:37.311 --> 04:40.648
but I really like
what we're doing,

04:40.714 --> 04:41.915
and I'd love
to have you there tonight

04:41.982 --> 04:46.920
to just, you know...
oh, fuck.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.989
Always, right?

04:49.056 --> 04:51.625
Always out of line.

04:55.896 --> 04:59.400
I would...

04:59.466 --> 05:03.437
so love...

05:03.504 --> 05:06.907
to go and celebrate your mother
with you tonight.

05:06.974 --> 05:10.611
Also, who says
I'm not your girl?

05:21.622 --> 05:23.657
I just realized
I don't know what I'm eating.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.592
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I would eat

05:25.659 --> 05:27.795
Takis-flavored flan
if you made it,

05:27.861 --> 05:29.563
but this is what?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.432
It's, like,
your version of pitaquiles.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.499
Am I gonna die?

05:32.566 --> 05:33.701
I told you, I don't cook.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.637
I just mix things together
and reheat them.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.505
Now, let me finish this.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.788
Well, that was
a very entertaining essay

05:54.855 --> 05:56.724
about sexism in the military.

05:58.959 --> 06:02.396
And how to make an adult woman
cum in a bunk bed.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.001
Is it autobiographical?

06:08.068 --> 06:09.937
Kind of.
It's about an ex.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.039
- Zoe.
- No.

06:12.106 --> 06:13.907
Someone from when
I was on duty.

06:13.974 --> 06:18.912
And we sort of developed
this sexist trauma coping bond.

06:18.979 --> 06:22.516
When you're in the service,
you-you cope weird sometimes.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.985
For me, I guess
I just always ended up

06:25.052 --> 06:26.854
finding a shiny object
to distract me.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.091
Was Zoe
a distraction too?

06:31.158 --> 06:33.093
Something like that.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.595
Except more complicated.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.631
And what am I?

06:40.667 --> 06:42.870
Oh, no, no, no.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.972
I'm not falling
in that quicksand.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.006
Nope.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.677
Hey, those are kind of good,
by the way.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.412
So...

06:53.547 --> 06:55.182
Okay, do I have a pattern?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.719
I don't know.

06:58.786 --> 06:59.853
All I will say is that

06:59.920 --> 07:02.923
I am very attracted
to challenging women.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.192
Oh, that's what
you think of me.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.761
- That I'm difficult.
- Oh, girl.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.630
You're not putting words
in my mouth.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.002
Okay.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.175
Okay, we need
to get out of this room.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.546
Oh, my God, I'm fermenting.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.880
Been locked in here
in our own--

07:26.947 --> 07:28.448
Au jus?

07:28.515 --> 07:30.117
I know, I like it.

07:30.184 --> 07:31.752
That Emma funk...

07:31.819 --> 07:34.521
- Oh, God, what?

07:37.825 --> 07:39.793
I'm serious,
let's get cleaned up,

07:39.860 --> 07:41.929
and let's pick up this pigsty.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.163
Please.

♪ As you wish ♪

07:49.069 --> 07:51.171
Yeah.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.973

07:54.875 --> 07:57.945

07:59.947 --> 08:01.782

You're fucked up.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.277
Oh, shit, Mari, sorry.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.679
Wait.
Gotta knock at least, shit.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.581
I brought you some champurrado.

08:34.648 --> 08:35.782
Some tamales in there too.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.218
Mm, thanks.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.254
How was it?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.655
- Last night?
- Uh-huh.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.023
Shit, I just
kept thinking, like,

08:43.090 --> 08:44.591
how long has this couch
been here?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.093
Since apá ran the shop, right?

08:46.159 --> 08:49.596
Yeah, yeah, we were little
chamaquitos since he had that.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.131
Guácala, man.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.734
I'ma have to put, like, triple
sheets on it or something.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.202
Hey, and since this seems like

08:55.269 --> 08:57.704
it's gonna be my living
situation till further notice,

08:57.771 --> 09:00.107
I don't want my ass to fall
into the dirty toilet water,

09:00.173 --> 09:02.175
so can you finally add
a damn toilet seat, please?

09:02.242 --> 09:04.745
Yeah, no.
I-I've been meaning to.

09:04.811 --> 09:05.812
MARI:

09:08.148 --> 09:10.017
I'm sorry you have
to stay here, Mari.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.555
- How's the baby?
- Oh, man.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.826
I can't stop looking at her.
She's so perfect.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.728
You know, I used
to make fun of people

09:21.795 --> 09:22.930
who want to show off their
baby pictures all the time,

09:22.996 --> 09:24.331
but...

09:27.267 --> 09:29.202
Mm, I just want to bite
her little cheeks.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.171
Right?
I do too.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.873
I wish I could've spent
more time with her yesterday,

09:32.940 --> 09:34.675
pero I had to get
my bike fixed.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.877
I started a new job,
so I need it,

09:36.944 --> 09:38.045
gotta make that money,
you know?

09:38.111 --> 09:39.913
Oh, which reminds me--

09:39.980 --> 09:41.748
thanks for spotting me
for that Tdap vaccine.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.617
Here's your change.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.985
I didn't even know you needed
a new vaccine

09:45.052 --> 09:46.720
to see a baby--
never done it before.

09:46.787 --> 09:50.724
Yeah, Carla is being
super protective of Elenita.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.260
Well, it seems
like it's going--

09:53.327 --> 09:55.862
I don't know, it seems like you
guys are getting along, right?

09:55.929 --> 09:59.299
Yeah.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.702
Yeah, a baby changes you, man.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.672
It changes your priorities.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.341
Carla and I are making it work.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.643
MARI: All right. Man.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.877
Got this
work orientation thing.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.079
I don't want to be late.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.747
I can't keep up
with your hustle.

10:13.814 --> 10:14.982
Well,
if I want to get

10:15.048 --> 10:16.383
my own place
with my own toilet seat,

10:16.650 --> 10:18.652
then I need
to stay on my grind.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.153
Hey, uh, don't forget
to take apá

10:20.220 --> 10:21.788
to his blood transfusion
appointment.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.323
He gets todo,
like, woozy after,

10:23.390 --> 10:24.358
so you gotta, like,
sit with him for a minute.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.892
You know when I told him

10:25.959 --> 10:26.927
he had to get a shot
to meet the baby,

10:26.994 --> 10:28.095
he got all berrinchudo?

10:28.161 --> 10:30.030
Such a fucking handful.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.631
Yeah, I'll take him.

10:31.698 --> 10:32.966
All right,
thanks for breakfast.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.068
Mm.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.305
Boyle Heights se defiende,
el barrio no se vende.

10:38.372 --> 10:39.873
Seriously,
having the cops arrest them

10:39.940 --> 10:42.642
for almost blinding me
wasn't enough?

10:42.709 --> 10:44.044
Hey, babe, these antifa types

10:44.111 --> 10:45.379
have nothing better to do
que chingar.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.780
Trust me, I know firsthand.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.715
But, like, look.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.050
That shared office space

10:50.117 --> 10:51.818
that's opening up
right behind them,

10:51.885 --> 10:55.022
like, I get
protesting that, but us?

10:55.088 --> 10:58.125
Literally just turn around.
Turn around.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.327
Boyle Heights se defiende...

11:00.394 --> 11:02.229
Should I call a couple
of my sheriff friends, hmm?

11:02.295 --> 11:03.263
To come keep the peace?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.198
No.
Can you imagine?

11:05.265 --> 11:07.434
No, we would look--

11:07.701 --> 11:08.869
no.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.438
WOMAN: Look who showed up
on the parking lot.

11:11.705 --> 11:12.973
- Pito boyfriend.
- Go ahead.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.941
WOMAN: Basic ass whitetina.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.676
WOMAN: Pinche arrepentida,
¿no te da vergüenza?

11:16.743 --> 11:18.111
WOMAN: Get out of here,
nobody wants you!

11:18.178 --> 11:20.213
Coconut Barbie!

11:20.280 --> 11:22.949
Parking lot pito!

11:23.016 --> 11:24.684
And remember,
it's cocktail attire.

11:24.751 --> 11:26.253
I'll see you tonight, babe.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.254
PERSON: Nobody wants you,
coconut Barbie.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.056
PERSON: Ooh, look!

11:29.122 --> 11:31.391
- Yeah, I'll see you tonight.
- PERSON: Coconut Barbie!

11:31.458 --> 11:34.728

11:34.795 --> 11:36.763
Pinche coconut Barbie.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.198

Get the fuck out of here!

11:38.265 --> 11:39.366
PERSON: Coconut Barbie.

11:39.433 --> 11:40.734
PERSON: Nobody wants you here!

11:46.339 --> 11:48.375
Oof, that cat pee's pungent.

11:48.442 --> 11:50.210
Blanca, you got cats?

11:50.277 --> 11:52.312
Nope.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.114
I'll grab some trash bags.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.052
Oh, from your BDSM days.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.754
Needs un chingo de Clorox.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.723
Remember Tetris?

12:05.492 --> 12:07.360
I remember this guy.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.262
I don't.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.232
She got trapped
under some pussy
for eight years.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.835
Oh, so now Vida
was just some pussy?

12:14.901 --> 12:17.771
Vida set you straight.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.372
Uh, well, she set you right.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.508
I just got all lost.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.244
Carnala,
this has got to go.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.346
You're never gonna
use a Raiders beer hat.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.949
- You don't know that.

12:29.015 --> 12:31.051
All this shit has to go.

12:31.118 --> 12:34.154
Rock, we came to grab
some clothes, y ya.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.523
See, this is why I didn't
want to take a ride from you.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.459
'Cause I knew que te ibas
a poner all Marie Kondo
and shit.

12:39.526 --> 12:42.762
Well, I don't understand
why you don't go back there
and just get your clothes.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.064
You gonna walk around
toda apretada

12:44.131 --> 12:45.332
'cause you scared of those two?

12:45.398 --> 12:47.033
I'm not scared.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.269
I just don't want to be
the asshole that tells them

12:49.336 --> 12:51.938
that their father's been alive
and well all this time.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.307
I'm sorry.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.777
You know I'm not a fan
of those two.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.112
But it's shitty
that you're gonna let them

12:59.179 --> 13:01.414
stay in the dark like that.

13:01.481 --> 13:05.051
Fucking Vida, man.
This is not my drama.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.254
This--this is Vida drama.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.556
I shouldn't be all tangled up
in this.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.129
Fine.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.866
But I'm not gonna tell them
face-to-face.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.035
I'll write them a letter.

13:22.102 --> 13:25.906
Y ya, quit talking about this
and help me find some chones.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.141
NICO: "No one puts baby
in a corner"?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.910
EMMA: I like reading.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.412
- The Sandlot?
- Are you talking to me?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.214
You're killing me, Emma.
Jesus.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.082
What about
Robin Hood: Men in Tights?

13:36.149 --> 13:39.452
Come on, what were you doing
between seven and now?

13:39.519 --> 13:42.088
- LYN: Oh, hello, good morning!
- What am I getting myself...

13:42.155 --> 13:45.358
It's okay, no one has to thank
me for staying away all weekend

13:45.425 --> 13:47.127
so you two could have
your finger fiesta.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.128
It's fine.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.465
Lyn, please tell me that
you've seen "Princess Bride."

13:52.532 --> 13:54.467
Hello.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.603
My name is Inigo Montoya.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.239
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.107
NICO: See?
Case in point.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.109
The only people that haven't
seen The Princess Bride

14:03.176 --> 14:04.544
are the Amish
or serial killers.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.314
Lyn, when did you see it?
Not when we were kids.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.015
Well, isn't it,
like, always on?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.584
Yeah.
Saw it last week.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.852
The first time
I saw it, though,

14:12.919 --> 14:14.888
was at Hollywood Forever with
a picnic and some absinthe.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.289
It was epic.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.991
Okay, well, who knew
this was...

14:18.058 --> 14:19.526
Well, Emma, there are
certain movies that are, like,

14:19.593 --> 14:21.995
so iconic that if you don't
catch up and watch them,

14:22.062 --> 14:24.564
you'll be totally lost at
parties when people are like,

14:24.631 --> 14:26.866
"There's no crying
in baseball!"

14:26.933 --> 14:28.235
I mean, I know that one.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.936
I should hope so.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.074
What's that face?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.945
- It's the only one I got.
- Mm.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.049
Hello, hi.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.418
And we're back
from Isle of Lesbos.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.320
I need you undivided
so that I can tell you

14:47.387 --> 14:48.955
about my super amazing plan
that I made--

14:49.022 --> 14:50.457
Okay, who did you book?

14:50.523 --> 14:53.393
Can you just not interrupt?

14:53.460 --> 14:55.095
I have this, like,
whole thing that I...

14:55.161 --> 14:57.163
Okay, okay.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.232
I'm trying to book
Nancy Sanchez,

14:59.299 --> 15:02.002
but I also think
that we should start
doing DJs with a following.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.070
So, for tonight,

15:04.137 --> 15:07.474
we are having
Linda Nuves spin.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.209
Oh, hmm.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.644
And Emma, just so you know,
it's a total get.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.379
But...

15:14.514 --> 15:17.550
Because we are now...

15:17.617 --> 15:18.685
a hit...

15:18.952 --> 15:21.121
and have been put on the map--

15:21.187 --> 15:23.023
did you read this?

15:23.089 --> 15:24.658
No.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.094
Well, there's a whole slate
of things I think we should do.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.562
We are a bar, right?

15:29.629 --> 15:31.197
Correct.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.567
And bars need badass
drinking game nights,

15:34.634 --> 15:37.337
so I think we should start
with this one.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.538
It's called Tragos.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.040
You buy a drink.
You pay to play.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.410
First question:

15:43.476 --> 15:46.713
If you still fear la chancla,
take five sips.

15:46.980 --> 15:50.617
I mean, who doesn't still have
nightmares about la chancla?

15:50.684 --> 15:52.419
LYN: One, two, three,
four, five.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.654
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God, look at that.

15:54.721 --> 15:58.558
I already need another drink.
So fun, right?

15:58.625 --> 16:01.328
There's, like, a million games
I think we could play
each night.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.996
You know how I tried
to do lotería night

16:03.063 --> 16:04.364
and it didn't quite--

16:04.431 --> 16:05.398
It was a bust.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.100
'Scuse you.

16:07.167 --> 16:10.136
It was my first try,
and I had the wrong approach,

16:10.203 --> 16:12.405
but there's no reason
that that can't become

16:12.472 --> 16:15.141
drunken lotería.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.509
Hmm.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.512
50 bucks gets you
all 16 shots for the board.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.247
And before you
say anything, Emma,

16:21.314 --> 16:23.149
I did the math
and if we use these, like,

16:23.216 --> 16:26.086
baby, mini half-shots,
at $2.50 a shot,

16:26.152 --> 16:30.690
we would still make money
and, like, $10 profit.

16:30.757 --> 16:33.326
So, that's my plan.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.298
Math checks out.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.641
It sounds great.
How can I help?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.744
Oh, my God.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.512
Okay, thank you.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.415
Uh, well,

16:55.482 --> 16:58.118
tonight you can help me
by holding down the fort.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.053
Once I set up everything
for the DJs

17:00.120 --> 17:01.121
and leave everything ready,

17:01.187 --> 17:04.057
'cause I have to go to

17:04.124 --> 17:07.627
my boyfriend's--
yep, you heard me--

17:07.694 --> 17:09.562
my boyfriend's mother's
birthday party.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.298
Of course
there was gonna be a catch.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.234
You think it
and I make it happen.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.635
- No, I'm--I'm gonna--

17:15.702 --> 17:18.204
Get the fuck out,
pinche vendidas!

17:18.271 --> 17:20.473
Oh, hell, no.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.509
Oh, no, no, no.
Emma, Emma, Emma.

17:22.575 --> 17:23.710
Leave it, leave it.

17:23.777 --> 17:25.712
They--
they didn't even break it.

17:25.779 --> 17:26.813
You know,
it's one thing for them

17:27.080 --> 17:28.381
to shout their bad puns
out there,

17:28.448 --> 17:30.583
but I'm not gonna
let them terrorize us.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.619
I just witnessed
them trespassing.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.491
And I can very much
call the cops.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.392
- BOTH: Oh, no!
- EMMA: Yep.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.094
No, um, oh, my God.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.328
Emma, you sound just like Rudy.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.431
No cops.

17:44.497 --> 17:49.602
Just let them
chant their chants out there.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.504
We're turning the cheek.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.740
We're basically famous now.

17:53.807 --> 17:58.678
So, please,
no rascuacheness.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.647
Turning cheeks.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.719
Teacup got followed home
for no reason.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.788
If one of those pigs
ever tries to arrest you,

18:08.855 --> 18:10.323
remember to go limp, okay?

18:10.390 --> 18:11.691
They can't accuse you
of throwing a punch

18:11.758 --> 18:13.259
if your whole body's slack.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.195
Fuck, that's genius.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.465
Well, well, well,
look who showed up
on Mari standard time.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.500
What?
I started a new job today.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.168
Besides, the text didn't say
this was a meeting.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.337
No, but it did say
it was urgent.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.705
What are you walking around
with an attitude like that,
Mari?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.106
- What?
- Yeah.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.608
Everyone saw
you didn't do shit for Yoli

18:28.675 --> 18:30.210
when she got led off in chains.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.613
Just fucking stood there.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.883
What was I supposed to do?
I gave to her bail fund.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.152
Besides, what the fuck
did y'all do when Yoli
was on the ground?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.588
Not a goddamn thing.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.723
And now you're over here
trying to do a fucking TED Talk
about resisting

18:43.790 --> 18:45.391
when your ass
has never even been arrested?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.227
Get the fuck out of here.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.196
Hey.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.413
- The DJ sounds unbelievable.
- Mm-hmm.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.748
And she has
everything she needs,

19:08.815 --> 19:10.917
so I think
I'm gonna go get ready.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.418
Okay.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.820
Oh, also,

19:13.887 --> 19:15.388
if it's gonna be this busy
in here from now on--

19:15.455 --> 19:17.290
and trust, it will--

19:17.357 --> 19:19.659
we're gonna need
an extra pair of hands.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.528
Maybe Eddy's available?

19:31.704 --> 19:33.273
I promise you, I mean it.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.874
I didn't tell her
where Vida was.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.543
I didn't even tell her
what the bar was called.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.811
Bonjour.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.682
I have been texting you
and you keep leaving me
on "read."

19:42.749 --> 19:44.684
Thankfully, your location
share's still on,

19:44.751 --> 19:47.654
because otherwise,
you know how freaked out
I would've been?

19:47.720 --> 19:49.722
Are you fucking serious, Zoe?

19:49.789 --> 19:51.958
You got a tag on me like
a dolphin in the fucking wild?

19:52.225 --> 19:53.593
I was just worried.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.629
We need to talk.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.265
Well, I can't.
I'm working.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.767
I can wait.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.236
Oh, concha tu madre.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.571
Could I get a Muscadet, please?

20:04.637 --> 20:07.774
I'm sorry, we don't serve wine.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.876
Tequila, then.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.578
Just nothing that starts
with a J.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.253
I'm really fucking sorry
about this, Emma.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.588
It's okay.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.570
No hombre, jail was whatever.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.539
But I had to answer
to an even tougher authority

20:39.606 --> 20:41.007
in the morning:
my pissed off amá.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.242
I feel you.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.748
I'm glad you're good, Yoli.
Talk later.

20:48.815 --> 20:49.916
Bye, girl.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.289
I made sure to call your amá
so she wouldn't worry so much.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.758
She told me.

20:58.825 --> 21:01.394
Look, I'm so
fucking sorry, Yoli.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.262
It-it's fine.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.965
It wouldn't do us both
no good to end up jail.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.900
I just...

21:07.967 --> 21:10.970
panicked, I guess.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.739
I pulled out my phone

21:12.805 --> 21:15.341
when they were putting you in
the patrol car and I posted it.

21:15.408 --> 21:18.011
I don't know why I didn't think
to start recording earlier.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.380
But look,
it got a ton of views.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.048
YOLI: She came at me, man!

21:22.315 --> 21:24.317
That's good Mari.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.885
'Cause I'm not taking
my foot off the pedal

21:25.952 --> 21:28.988
with that bar
and those two vendidas.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.758
And it pisses me off so much
that nothing happened

21:31.824 --> 21:34.460
to that snooty-ass bitch
who punched me.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.695
And if that coconut Barbie

21:35.762 --> 21:37.397
presses charges
'cause of the detergent

21:37.463 --> 21:40.333
and fucks with my DACA?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.602
I'm going scorched earth.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.404
Palabra.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.337
Was it cocktail attire?

22:18.404 --> 22:19.839
- Yes, I told you that.
- No, you didn't.

22:19.906 --> 22:20.907
When?

22:20.973 --> 22:22.709
Oh, my God,
I totally missed that.

22:23.076 --> 22:27.980
Ay, por fin llegó
la invitada más esperada.

22:28.047 --> 22:33.553
Bienvenida, corazón.
Ah!

22:33.619 --> 22:35.755
Ay, Rodolfo, qué grosero.

22:35.822 --> 22:38.858
No le explicaste que era
vestimenta de coctel.

22:38.925 --> 22:43.696
Pero no te preocupes,
preciosa.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.431
Happy birthday.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.667
¿No entiende español?

22:47.734 --> 22:50.069
Oh, she does, Mami.
She understands it.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.371
She was just born here,
so she doesn't speak it
that well.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.607
- Oh.
- Sí.

22:54.674 --> 22:58.044
You were born here,
and you speak it perfectly.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.515
But don't worry, my darling.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.784
I don't blame you.

23:04.851 --> 23:07.120
I blame your parents.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.391
Come.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.027
I'm going to introduce you
to everyone.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.996
Rodolfo, ven.
Presenta a tu novia.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.065
Hola, miren quién llegó.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.402
- ...not wanna dance!
ZOE:

23:23.469 --> 23:25.738
Come on, dance with me!

23:27.774 --> 23:29.575
Whoopsie.

23:29.642 --> 23:32.712
Don't worry,
the barback will get that.

23:32.779 --> 23:35.615
Excuse me!
Barback.

23:37.617 --> 23:38.818
She gotta go.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.821
Hey.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.556
She's just trying
to get to you.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.858
Don't let her, okay?

23:55.201 --> 23:56.202
MARI: Emma.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.076
You have a lot of nerve
coming in here.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.611
I know.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.213
I let you in my home,
I feed you,

24:07.480 --> 24:08.981
and what do you do?

24:09.048 --> 24:10.983
You use us and you bring those
little agitators to our--

24:11.050 --> 24:12.752
No, no, no, hold on.
I didn't bring them.

24:12.819 --> 24:16.022
I tried to tell you, pero...

24:16.088 --> 24:18.624
look, nothing that I say
about that night

24:18.691 --> 24:20.827
is gonna clear me in your eyes.

24:20.893 --> 24:25.031
It was a very complicated
and just fucked up night
for me.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.232
I messed up left and right.

24:26.499 --> 24:28.601
Did you see what
they did to Lyn?

24:28.668 --> 24:30.169
Of course you didn't,
you just stood there

24:30.236 --> 24:33.973
while that bully put soap
in her eyes.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.141
Are you gonna
press charges on her?

24:35.208 --> 24:36.809
I should.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.781
I know in your eyes
she's a bully,

24:41.848 --> 24:43.983
but Yoli--
that's her name--

24:44.050 --> 24:47.620
she's my best friend,
and she's DACA.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.155
And I don't know
if you know about DACA,

24:49.222 --> 24:53.125
but if she gets a stain
on her record, she's fucked.

24:53.192 --> 24:56.629
She threw detergent
in my sister's eyes.

25:00.633 --> 25:04.003
Is she gonna stop
protesting us?

25:04.070 --> 25:07.807
No, but you know,
however bad the beef is
with the neighborhood,

25:07.874 --> 25:09.742
the shittiest thing
you can do to your own people

25:09.809 --> 25:10.843
is fuck with their status
like that--

25:10.910 --> 25:12.812
Oh, isn't that something?

25:12.879 --> 25:15.181
No consequence for her,
but she can keep
fucking with us?

25:15.248 --> 25:17.116
Well, maybe the vigilantes
will get off your back

25:17.183 --> 25:20.586
if you support
some local groups or some orgs.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.788
Maybe if you give back
to the community

25:22.855 --> 25:25.892
and make a thing about it,
then they'll back off.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.827
Don't come back here, Mari.

25:27.894 --> 25:30.630
You really showed
your true colors
Saturday night.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.969
You know, my father
was undocumented.

25:39.572 --> 25:42.675
And it didn't end well for him.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.044
I would never go after
someone's status.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.946
I'm not a fucking monster.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.615
ZOE: Go ahead and slap me!

25:49.682 --> 25:51.050
Slap me!

25:51.117 --> 25:53.152
Go ahead!
Just give me a fucking slap.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.190
Nico, take her to the bathroom
and put some water on her face.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.926
Yeah.
She's gotta get her ass home.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.127
- ZOE: Slap me!
- NICO: Zoe.

26:06.299 --> 26:07.300
- I'm good.
- Come on.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.701
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.269
- Good.
- Yeah, you're good, come on.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.604
- ZOE: Good.
- Come on.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.107
MAN: Ahora es cuándo hay
que entrarle con todo.

26:15.174 --> 26:19.245
Neta, hermano,
en Monterrey sobran
este tipo de oportunidades.

26:19.312 --> 26:22.348
Hoy mismo te presento
a tres inversionistas regios

26:22.615 --> 26:24.617
que fácilmente fondean
tu proyecto.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.319
En Monterrey está la lana.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.621
Oh, I used to live in Monterey.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.089
Well, in Pebble Beach.

26:30.156 --> 26:33.626
I had a--
well, I lived in a house there.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.594
Pebble Beach has
some unbelievable views,

26:35.661 --> 26:38.731
but I meant the real Monterrey,
in Nuevo León.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.902
In Mexico, mamita.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.671
- Oh.

26:45.738 --> 26:48.007
- I'm gonna go for a refill.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.775
Okay.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.377
Pues como te estaba diciendo,
mi primo,

26:51.644 --> 26:54.847
te vienes un fin de semana,
te quedas con nosotros...

26:54.914 --> 26:55.948
Thank you.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.300
- I, uh...
- Oh, God.

27:14.367 --> 27:18.371
...just want to announce myself
so you don't become scared.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.039
I-I can go somewhere else
if you'd like.

27:20.106 --> 27:22.074
Oh, no, it's...

27:24.043 --> 27:28.080
No, you're--
you're fine.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.382
I don't mind.

27:43.229 --> 27:48.300
So are you Russian,
or, like, Ukrainian?

27:48.367 --> 27:50.903
I'm Polish.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.805
Sorry.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.341
I'm not so good at accents.

27:55.408 --> 27:58.310
I can have a conversation
in Russian if I focus.

27:58.377 --> 28:01.447
I'm supposed
to be bilingual too.

28:01.714 --> 28:03.082
But it's all lies.

28:05.151 --> 28:09.288
I can barely hold
a conversation in English.

28:09.355 --> 28:14.326
And in Spanish, I don't go past
"Dora the Explorer" level.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.963
- You are, uh, Mexican?
- Mm, sort of.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.866
No, I am.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.237
But those people in there?

28:25.304 --> 28:27.073
They might think otherwise.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.810
I thought everybody inside
was Mexican.

28:30.876 --> 28:33.846
Oh, yes.
The most.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.852
But I don't know if...

28:39.919 --> 28:42.021
they'd consider me
to be Mexican.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.292
Technically,
I'm second generation,

28:46.358 --> 28:50.896
so... I'm Mexican-American.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.098
Chicana.

28:52.164 --> 28:55.267
That's what my mami
used to call us.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.970
But I'm not so political,
so I don't know if I'm that.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.908
Wow, did--

29:02.975 --> 29:04.910
did that drink just hit me?

29:07.413 --> 29:10.916
I'm confused by what you mean.

29:14.019 --> 29:18.023
It's a confusing thing to walk
around looking like this,

29:18.090 --> 29:22.061
where everyone non-Mexican
only sees you as Mexican,

29:22.128 --> 29:25.865
but then, like,
the Mexico-Mexicans are like,

29:25.931 --> 29:29.835
"No, eh, not Mexican enough."

29:32.838 --> 29:37.209
All these stupid tests.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.445
Just because I was born
with a broken tongue.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.285
Broken tongue's our language.

29:46.352 --> 29:49.288
That's how language
becomes language.

29:49.355 --> 29:53.459
When two tongues
smash together.

29:53.526 --> 29:57.796
You can tell a person's story
with their tongue.

29:57.863 --> 29:59.832
You are so right.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.469
We adapt.

30:05.538 --> 30:08.274
That's what I do.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.276
I adapt.

30:10.342 --> 30:13.412
I survive.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.483
That's my superpower.

30:32.264 --> 30:36.435

30:48.847 --> 30:50.416
All right. Oh.

31:01.427 --> 31:03.862
Hey, it's not as suspect
as it looks.

31:03.929 --> 31:05.264
There's just a way
that you have to talk to her

31:05.331 --> 31:07.166
when she gets drunk.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.935
I'm not gonna make anything
of this unless you tell me to.

31:10.002 --> 31:14.240
No storming off,
no rash anything.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.041
I trust you.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.179
I also trust you
to go tend my bar,

31:20.246 --> 31:21.614
because it's been sitting there
for a while now.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.349
- My bad.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.387
- Go.
- Okay.

31:32.925 --> 31:34.226
All right.
Time to call you a Lyft, lady.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.231
- One, two, three!
- ZOE:

31:52.044 --> 31:55.047

"Call me back."

31:55.114 --> 31:56.515
RUDY: Wait, wait.
She does the cutest thing
when she was little.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.051
Please, Lyn, can you count?

31:59.118 --> 32:05.591
Once, doce, trece,
cuatroce, cincoce, seisce...

32:05.658 --> 32:06.659
Sietece. Ochoce.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.260
Yes.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.596
- Siéntense.
- Makes perfect sense.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.131
To cuatroce.

32:12.197 --> 32:14.066
To cuatroce.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.181
Okay, yeah, I'm just gonna...

32:30.382 --> 32:32.518
Sorry.
Oh, God.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.458
I'm gonna go get yogurt
for smoothies.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.493
For Princess Bride
and chill?

32:41.560 --> 32:42.528
EMMA: Sure.

32:43.495 --> 32:47.232
Now you're supposed to say,
"As you wish."

32:49.535 --> 32:50.969
Hey.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.509
I think I'm gonna go
get my stuff.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.445
Zoe shows no signs of leaving.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.714
She has more rights
to the place than I do.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.682
She introduced me to Matty.

33:05.751 --> 33:09.488
Is it cool if I, like,
keep my stuff here?

33:09.555 --> 33:11.457
Just, like, till I figure out
where to go?

33:23.202 --> 33:25.337
Hurry back, now.

33:39.084 --> 33:40.119
