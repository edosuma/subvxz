00:07.590 --> 00:10.635
-[crowd cheering]
-[whistle blowing]

00:13.054 --> 00:16.558
[man] The game of basketball
just made me really dream big.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.979
I was just a young kid in the ghetto,

00:21.688 --> 00:23.606
playing a game that I loved.

00:24.774 --> 00:27.318
I had no idea what it could do.

00:32.615 --> 00:36.995
But then I realized I could go places
I never thought I would go before.

00:40.623 --> 00:42.667
You just gotta go for it.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.128
[commentator] Hedake, end to end.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.588
[announcer] Hedake Smith!

00:47.505 --> 00:50.675
-[commentator] Oh, my. Oh, my.
-[comm 2] Hedake.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.928
[comm 3] There's your leader right there,
Stevin "Hedake" Smith.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.390
Hedake, doing it with one. Count it!

00:57.474 --> 01:00.769
A spectacular performance by Stevin Smith.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.854
[crowd cheering]

01:10.945 --> 01:11.946
[inhales]

01:12.030 --> 01:14.115
Could you excuse me for a moment, please?

01:21.331 --> 01:25.710
To be honest with you, it's like
I can't even find the words to explain

01:25.794 --> 01:28.671
the feeling, you know? Of what I lost.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.468
[man 1] This is one
of the most significant

01:33.551 --> 01:37.680
sports conspiracies
involving college athletes in the country.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.517
[man 2] It was a huge scandal…

01:40.600 --> 01:43.728
on a scale that hadn't been seen
in college basketball

01:43.812 --> 01:45.563
in a long, long time, if ever.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.024
[commentator] Hedake going for the record.

01:48.983 --> 01:52.570
My personal reaction is, "How could you
do this? Why would you do this?"

01:52.654 --> 01:54.614
[man] Rumors started spreading
around the town

01:54.697 --> 01:57.283
like they had some sort
of inside information.

01:57.367 --> 02:01.162
They've all assured me
that there's no involvement on their part,

02:01.246 --> 02:02.205
and I believe 'em.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.290
Oh, shit.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.584
[commentator] There it is.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.212
Oh. Oh, two misses!

02:09.295 --> 02:10.463
My goodness.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.508
[man] I'm thinking,
"What's going on with these guys?"

02:13.591 --> 02:16.010
"Are we on the same team right now?"

02:16.094 --> 02:18.471
[commentator]
Arizona State is doing everything it can

02:18.555 --> 02:20.014
to throw this game away.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.350
[man] We're talking about students

02:22.433 --> 02:26.187
who are running operations in the tens
and hundreds of thousands of dollars.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.898
And that's when I saw the big picture.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.735
There was people behind the scenes…

02:34.946 --> 02:36.322
who'd ruined everything.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.381
[theme music playing]

03:16.237 --> 03:18.656
[crowd cheering]

03:31.085 --> 03:33.796
[man] Having been a sports columnist
at the Arizona Republic

03:33.880 --> 03:35.590
for almost 35 years,

03:37.133 --> 03:38.676
I've pretty much lived my life

03:39.219 --> 03:42.263
as a reporter covering
the Arizona State college teams.

03:43.264 --> 03:46.726
I started covering Sun Devil basketball
in the early '90s,

03:46.809 --> 03:49.771
um, when Bill Frieder became head coach.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.147
[indistinct chatter]

03:51.231 --> 03:55.026
[man] It's a fabulous school,
tremendous facilities, super campus.

03:55.109 --> 03:58.404
Uh, you know,
the weather today is 75 degrees.

04:00.031 --> 04:04.035
[Kent] At that time, Arizona State
was a college that had a lot going for it.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.913
It was a popular school with a mixture

04:07.580 --> 04:09.415
of kids from different backgrounds.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.294
But they had one of the worst
basketball programs in the country.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.632
They hadn't been to the NCAA tournament
since the early '80s.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.428
They were a sleeping giant
and most of us who lived there thought,

04:22.512 --> 04:24.555
"This giant is never going to wake up."

04:25.056 --> 04:27.475
[upbeat music playing]

04:28.726 --> 04:30.853
But Friedman made an immediate impact

04:30.937 --> 04:33.690
recruiting the most talented
players available.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.194
I mean, highly-ranked guys,
and those of us covering the team

04:38.278 --> 04:40.780
were like, "How did he get these people?"

04:40.863 --> 04:43.408
[commentator] Over the head they go. Oh!

04:43.491 --> 04:45.868
-[indistinct chattering]
-[crowd cheering]

04:46.577 --> 04:49.956
Suddenly, the atmosphere at the arena
changed dramatically.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.505
[man] It was awesome,

04:58.131 --> 05:01.217
being a member of the ASU teams,

05:01.301 --> 05:04.304
especially in those years
when we were a pretty good team.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.806
We had highly-touted players.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.267
There was Isaac Burton,

05:09.350 --> 05:10.476
Mario Bennett,

05:10.560 --> 05:12.020
Ryan Riley.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.189
We were a unit, working together.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.151
[commentator] This team lives and dies
with the man who has the ball,

05:18.234 --> 05:19.193
Hedake Smith.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.362
[comm 2]
Oh, what a heads-up play by Hedake Smith.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.115
[comm 1] He's just been unstoppable.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.701
[Dwayne]
And then there was the main attraction.

05:27.952 --> 05:31.664
Hedake was unbelievably talented.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.751
[commentator] …side, at 60, 4.6 left.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.336
Here comes Stevin Smith.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.338
-Pulls up from about 40.
-[buzzer sounding]

05:38.421 --> 05:41.049
It's good! He made it!

05:41.132 --> 05:44.802
Can you believe it? Stevin Smith…

05:46.262 --> 05:50.141
We was like fuckin' top rock stars.
I mean, it was amazing.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.935
[announcer] Point for Hedake Smith!

05:54.562 --> 05:58.191
Oh, my goodness.
We got star-studded treatment.

05:58.274 --> 06:01.944
Like, everywhere you go,
pretty much somebody knew you.

06:03.237 --> 06:04.947
But Hedake was definitely the man.

06:05.740 --> 06:10.286
And to see the way he was getting treated
everywhere we went and stuff like this,

06:10.370 --> 06:14.290
I was like, "This is amazing.
Like, wow. They love Hedake."

06:14.916 --> 06:18.461
[commentator] The key to Arizona State
is Stevin "Hedake" Smith

06:18.544 --> 06:21.714
and believe me,
he becomes a headache for the opposition.

06:23.007 --> 06:26.969
[Dwayne] Hedake could
absolutely dictate the outcome of a game.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.764
So, coming into the '93 season,

06:30.390 --> 06:32.809
I had high expectations for our team.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.978
And I knew that he wouldn't let us down.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.564
[commentator] Oh, my goodness!

06:38.648 --> 06:40.066
[crowd cheering]

06:42.193 --> 06:46.030
[Kent] There was absolutely real pressure
on this team, especially on Hedake Smith,

06:46.114 --> 06:48.533
because college basketball's
a huge business.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.910
The coaches make a ton of money,

06:50.993 --> 06:55.373
a successful program
can bring in millions to a school,

06:55.456 --> 06:56.290
um…

06:56.374 --> 06:59.752
and Arizona State probably felt like,
"We've got all the pieces here

06:59.836 --> 07:02.338
to contend for a conference title,

07:02.422 --> 07:05.633
and anything less than that
would be a big disappointment."

07:08.052 --> 07:08.886
I mean…

07:11.222 --> 07:13.224
we were making the school all that money

07:14.100 --> 07:16.811
and we didn't get compensated at all.

07:16.894 --> 07:18.438
[commentator] Smith. Whoa.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.858
[Hedake] They were the ones
who was behind the scenes

07:21.941 --> 07:23.317
with millions of dollars.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.027
[crowd cheering]

07:26.654 --> 07:29.699
We were the ones out there on the court.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.244
We all came from humble backgrounds,

07:33.911 --> 07:36.873
and we were all there
on basketball scholarships.

07:37.665 --> 07:41.752
You know, my first two years
living in a dorm,

07:41.836 --> 07:44.589
I got a check for $130 dollars a month.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.758
You know? And how can you live on that?

07:48.342 --> 07:50.803
There was times I didn't eat.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.264
I'm not making this up.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.018
I would sit in that room hungry,
bunch of times.

07:57.768 --> 08:00.605
I would walk to other people's dorms
and ask for something to eat.

08:01.105 --> 08:02.899
I mean, that was real.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.986
But, going into my senior year,

08:08.112 --> 08:11.908
you know, I knew I had a good chance
of making it to the NBA.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.662
And that's when I could start
making big money.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.503
But what happened was, uh…

08:27.131 --> 08:29.884
I hooked up with a guy
that I had been knowing

08:30.760 --> 08:32.261
ever since my freshman year.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.097
Uh, a guy by the name of Benny Silman.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.435
He was the campus bookie.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.813
You know, he introduced me to gambling

08:43.856 --> 08:45.483
and that--

08:45.566 --> 08:48.945
That kinda changed everything.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.865
[Mozart's "Requiem in D minor" playing]

09:04.961 --> 09:07.547
[man] It was January, 1994.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.220
I was trading bond futures
at the board of trade in Chicago.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.137
Um…

09:16.097 --> 09:18.057
Twenty-two, 23 years old,

09:18.140 --> 09:20.518
living in a nice high-rise building,

09:20.601 --> 09:24.021
making an absurd amount of money
at a young age.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.648
[phone ringing]

09:25.731 --> 09:26.649
[beep]

09:28.025 --> 09:30.695
And I remember my phone ringing,
and it was Benny.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.238
Benny Silman.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.369
I had met Benny through my brother
at Arizona State University,

09:39.328 --> 09:42.373
and, um, he knew I gambled
since I was a kid,

09:43.457 --> 09:46.752
so I ended up establishing
a bookmaking account with him,

09:46.836 --> 09:49.255
and we developed kind of a friendship.

09:49.338 --> 09:53.884
All of a sudden, he starts talking about,
"Joe, I got a fix."

09:53.968 --> 09:55.428
"Joe, I got a fix."

09:56.554 --> 09:58.514
And I shrug it off, like…

10:00.141 --> 10:02.643
I didn't really absorb
what he was saying at first.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.062
And then finally he spelled it out.

10:05.646 --> 10:09.108
He spells F-I-X.

10:09.859 --> 10:13.529
And I said, "Oh, wow."
And it clicked with me all of a sudden.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.407
"Are you crazy?
Man, I'm not into that stuff."

10:16.490 --> 10:18.576
"That's wrong. I want no part of it."

10:18.659 --> 10:19.702
[phone beeps]

10:20.536 --> 10:22.788
Someone with a moral compass
woulda hung up…

10:23.289 --> 10:25.333
but I didn't have that compass in place.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.045
And then Benny said,
"Did you ever hear of Hedake Smith?"

10:29.545 --> 10:30.796
I said, "No idea."

10:31.631 --> 10:34.925
He said, "Hedake's the point guard
for the ASU basketball team."

10:35.885 --> 10:38.054
"He's an absolute basketball stud."

10:38.763 --> 10:43.267
"He dictates everything on the court.
And I got him."

10:44.727 --> 10:45.728
"I got him."

10:46.437 --> 10:47.980
He said, "He's a gambler."

10:48.856 --> 10:52.693
"And he's into my bookmaking operation
for about $10,000 bucks."

10:53.402 --> 10:55.488
"And he's got no way to pay me right now."

10:57.531 --> 11:01.077
And so, I concocted this plan
that the only way he could pay his debt

11:01.160 --> 11:02.536
is to fix a game.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.706
He said, "Joe, we can make some money."

11:06.832 --> 11:08.334
I said, "You know what, Benny?"

11:09.669 --> 11:11.921
"If I'm going to put dollars
in this thing,

11:12.004 --> 11:14.006
I wanna verify and validate this thing."

11:14.090 --> 11:15.716
"I gotta talk to this kid."

11:15.800 --> 11:17.385
[phone ringing]

11:18.761 --> 11:20.304
[phone ringing]

11:21.806 --> 11:23.432
[phone ringing]

11:24.809 --> 11:25.685
[phone ringing]

11:29.105 --> 11:32.858
I remember being on the phone
with Hedake and thinking

11:33.567 --> 11:34.610
he was afraid.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.196
I could almost hear his voice trembling.

11:37.780 --> 11:41.200
Oh, yeah, of course I was nervous
going into it, you know, but…

11:41.826 --> 11:44.412
at the same time, I owed Benny some money.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.124
So, ain't no turning back.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.751
He says to me, "I'll do this…

11:52.253 --> 11:53.713
but I don't wanna lose."

11:55.172 --> 11:57.216
I said, "Man, you don't have to lose."

11:57.299 --> 12:00.010
"Just don't win
by more than I'm gonna tell you to."

12:01.387 --> 12:02.471
I go, "Really?"

12:03.848 --> 12:06.726
"So, you're telling me we can win the game
and I can make money?"

12:06.809 --> 12:07.643
Yeah.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.646
[chuckles]

12:10.730 --> 12:11.981
Fucking no-brainer.

12:14.316 --> 12:17.820
[Joe] But, to his credit, he said,
"I only wanna do two games."

12:19.238 --> 12:23.075
He said, "Because then I'm gonna have
to turn my game up for the NBA scouts."

12:23.826 --> 12:27.663
Um, "It's real important that
I get drafted for my family and I."

12:27.747 --> 12:30.458
I said, "Okay."
I said, "I'll tell you what,

12:30.541 --> 12:34.003
Benny and I are gonna give you
$20,000 bucks a game."

12:34.545 --> 12:35.880
[Hedake laughing]

12:35.963 --> 12:37.089
Excuse me.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.551
I mean, oh, man.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.554
[Joe] I could tell that was
a boatload of money to him.

12:44.138 --> 12:48.392
I said, "Listen, if you want to bring on
any other players on the team,

12:48.476 --> 12:50.394
that's up to you to do,

12:50.478 --> 12:52.938
but I'm not paying
more than $20,000 dollars."

12:54.565 --> 12:59.195
That was, you know, it was a no-brainer.
I knew exactly who I could go to.

13:07.870 --> 13:11.957
Isaac Burton was, like,
a real special person to me, you know.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.795
He was real cool.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.546
He was Ice.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.967
Isaac Burton. Ice, Ice, Baby. That's me.

13:22.551 --> 13:25.346
[commentator]
Burton, in and on the floor. Look out.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.097
Oh, he is the man.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.892
Wild and crazy. Wild and crazy.

13:29.975 --> 13:33.020
I didn't do anything to hurt people,
like violence or nothing like that,

13:33.103 --> 13:37.024
but doing silly stuff like kids do,
that was all me.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.776
[crowd cheering]

13:38.859 --> 13:41.570
[Ice]
Hedake's like a true friend, teammate.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.198
We loved and respected each other.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.575
And, we all--
That's how we treated each other.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.161
I was his Robin, he was Batman.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.833
[Hedake] So, I drove over to the dorm

13:53.916 --> 13:57.127
and called him down,
you know, to my truck,

13:58.212 --> 14:00.923
and I was like, "Hey, young fella,

14:02.299 --> 14:04.802
got a way, you know, make you some cash."

14:05.302 --> 14:09.014
He said,
"I need you to do a favor for me."

14:09.098 --> 14:12.059
I'm like, "What?"
I'm thinking, "What you need from me?"

14:12.685 --> 14:17.690
He said, "I'm gonna need you to miss
some shots. You know, fix the game."

14:19.942 --> 14:21.402
And I was like, "No, no, no."

14:21.485 --> 14:23.654
"I'm not gonna do nothing crazy,
silly like that."

14:23.737 --> 14:28.993
But I knew that he could benefit,
you know, financially.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.455
Then I got a envelope,
right then and there.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.625
I got a envelope full of hundreds.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.462
I was like, "Yo."

14:40.963 --> 14:43.382
Next thing you know, he-he was all in.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.176
So, now I was like,
"Well, what do I gotta do?"

14:46.260 --> 14:49.305
And he started explaining to me
what point shaving is.

14:51.390 --> 14:55.436
[Joe] Like I said to Hedake,
fixing an outcome of a basketball game,

14:55.519 --> 14:57.396
it's all about betting lines.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.359
A betting line is established on a game

15:02.443 --> 15:06.655
with the simplicity of knowing
that there's a favorite and an underdog.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.909
So, for example,
if you're gonna bet the favorite

15:09.992 --> 15:12.536
on a line established around 12 points,

15:12.620 --> 15:16.457
the favorite needs to win
by more than that number.

15:17.374 --> 15:21.670
If you're gonna bet the underdog,
the underdog could lose the game outright,

15:21.754 --> 15:25.174
but they cannot lose
by more than what the line is,

15:25.257 --> 15:26.675
what the betting line is.

15:28.469 --> 15:32.932
What I did was I took the underdog.

15:33.891 --> 15:38.145
That's because it's easier
for the favorite to win a game by less.

15:39.146 --> 15:42.274
It's all about little subtleties
that a player can do.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.694
Maybe there's a bad pass.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.949
Maybe it's bricking a few free throws
down the stretch.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.245
Just control the game enough

15:55.329 --> 15:59.083
where your team is not gonna win
by more than X amount of points.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.460
That's how a fix is done.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.672
This is known as point shaving.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.383
Point shaving.

16:12.721 --> 16:15.808
So, I ended up, uh,
looking at the remaining schedule.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.728
And I saw, in about two weeks' time,
there were games coming up

16:19.812 --> 16:21.897
against Oregon State and Oregon.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.025
Two home games on a Thursday
and on a Saturday

16:25.651 --> 16:28.112
where ASU would be favored.

16:28.612 --> 16:32.533
Where Hedake and Isaac
could better control the game.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.204
So, I took Oregon State, the underdog.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.583
That's the side that I was on.
That's the side that my money was on.

16:43.168 --> 16:47.548
So, those factors in my mind,
I went to the bank the next morning,

16:48.424 --> 16:51.218
pulled out my entire trader's savings.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.973
I managed to put together
a little over $500,000 in cash.

16:57.474 --> 17:00.853
So, the only place to bet money like that

17:01.729 --> 17:02.896
would be Vegas.

17:02.980 --> 17:03.939
[car horn honking]

17:04.815 --> 17:06.316
[upbeat music playing]

17:17.161 --> 17:18.495
[siren wailing]

17:18.579 --> 17:20.164
I remember thinking to myself,

17:20.247 --> 17:23.292
"Vegas is the betting capital
of the world."

17:23.375 --> 17:27.087
"It's gonna be easy to bet 500,000 bucks
on a game."

17:28.756 --> 17:31.216
I'm telling you, it's not. It's not.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.557
These large corporations
are as greedy as can be.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.436
They don't want to lose money to you.

17:44.980 --> 17:49.735
It felt like eyeballs were on me
and people were watching me.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.782
The risk involved was

17:55.282 --> 17:57.576
creating the red flags

17:57.659 --> 18:01.455
that other people would get wind
of what I was doing.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.250
And the biggest way to do that would be

18:05.334 --> 18:07.753
to create what's known as a CTR,

18:08.253 --> 18:10.881
which is a currency transaction report.

18:11.632 --> 18:16.887
These are generated by casinos
when you're betting over 10,000 in cash.

18:17.763 --> 18:21.100
So, you had all this money you had to bet,

18:22.351 --> 18:26.438
but you did not want to do it
in any increment north of 9,900,

18:26.939 --> 18:29.525
because that's when
the questions are asked.

18:35.322 --> 18:41.078
And so, I ended up giving my dad,
who was living in Las Vegas, 100,000.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.831
Ended up giving
two of his friends 100,000.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.458
And we went to over 20 hotels.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.461
Didn't make any bets over 9,900,

18:51.296 --> 18:52.965
and we ended up getting all the money off.

18:56.718 --> 19:00.264
So, at the end of the day,
if everything went well…

19:02.307 --> 19:05.602
I'm gonna win a little under
$1.1 million on game one.

19:13.902 --> 19:17.072
Welcome to Tempe, everyone.
I'm Tim Healey, along with Gil Tyree.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.117
Glad you joined us this evening.
Keys to Victory tonight for ASU.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.120
Well, let's open it up and unlock it.
The first thing is the Stevin Watch.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.414
We wanna make sure
he'll have a big night against Oregon.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.044
[Ice] So, before the game, I was worried.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.255
'Cause I didn't wanna lose.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.340
I hate losing.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.886
But Hedake came up to me
in the locker room and he said,

19:38.969 --> 19:40.429
"We don't have to lose,

19:40.512 --> 19:43.015
we just have to win
by a certain amount of points."

19:43.098 --> 19:45.142
So, I said,
"How do we know what the point is?"

19:45.225 --> 19:47.144
He said, "Don't worry about that,
I'll tell you."

19:47.227 --> 19:50.731
I would always get a phone call
before the game.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.317
They would give me a number.

19:53.817 --> 19:57.905
In game one, ASU was a far superior team
than Oregon State.

19:59.740 --> 20:04.203
[Joe] On paper, they were
a 12 and a half or 13 point better team.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.580
That's the reality,

20:06.663 --> 20:08.624
but I was on a mission,

20:08.707 --> 20:12.794
and my mission was to secure
the money that I had in play.

20:13.337 --> 20:18.258
So, I gave Hedake and Isaac
a lower number to protect myself.

20:19.927 --> 20:23.263
For the first game, Hedake told me
that the number was six.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.849
That's what we had to win by.

20:25.933 --> 20:26.808
Six or less.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.478
[crowd cheering]

20:32.773 --> 20:34.650
[commentator]
Crowd starting to get into it,

20:35.442 --> 20:37.694
trying to fire the Sun Devils up here.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.866
They're ready to go
as Mario Bennett jumps center,

20:43.700 --> 20:46.036
and it will go to Oregon State.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.623
[Joe] We ended up going to the sports book

20:49.706 --> 20:51.625
with my dad and his two friends
and myself.

20:51.708 --> 20:54.795
We were gonna watch the game, but, um…

20:54.878 --> 20:56.380
it wasn't even on TV.

20:57.339 --> 21:02.219
It wasn't on TV, so we were sitting there
every five, ten, fifteen minutes,

21:02.302 --> 21:04.930
waiting for the score
to come across the ticker.

21:06.556 --> 21:10.686
And, I'll tell you what,
it didn't start off too good.

21:11.144 --> 21:14.356
[commentator] Devils in transition,
Hedake leads the fast break.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.650
Pulls up to the trey. That's in there.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.570
So, in the first half,
against Oregon State,

21:21.280 --> 21:22.572
Hedake go off.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.451
Hedake Smith knocks down the three.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.829
Puts up the shot, hits the bullseye.

21:28.912 --> 21:31.415
Hedake pulls the trigger-- Count it!

21:31.498 --> 21:32.457
[crowd cheering]

21:33.041 --> 21:37.379
Hedake has 16 points tonight,
four three-point buckets.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.632
It was unbelievable.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.093
It was shocking. Um…

21:43.802 --> 21:45.887
ASU went up by 13,

21:46.388 --> 21:49.391
and I thought
maybe he had a moment of clarity

21:49.474 --> 21:50.726
in his conscience

21:51.518 --> 21:54.021
saying that,
"What I got myself involved with

21:54.104 --> 21:57.649
was maybe not a good idea."

21:57.733 --> 21:59.860
[commentator] Hedake. Hedake. Hedake!

21:59.943 --> 22:01.528
[crowd cheering]

22:02.029 --> 22:07.492
Hedake stealing it.
A spectacular performance by Stevin Smith!

22:07.576 --> 22:11.038
I mean, just three after three
after three after three after three,

22:11.121 --> 22:14.666
and I'm like, "Oh, man.
We're gonna win by too much."

22:15.334 --> 22:18.754
[commentator] As Hedake comes up with 
his second steal and another easy lay-up.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.965
And it is a 15-point ASU lead.

22:22.549 --> 22:24.885
You start thinking,
"Gosh, what am I doing?"

22:24.968 --> 22:29.514
Here I am holding tickets that--
with Oregon State--

22:30.974 --> 22:34.811
that are all gonna be losers.

22:35.395 --> 22:38.273
[producer] Were you thinking,
"Has he changed his mind?"

22:38.357 --> 22:42.194
No, he just said, he said,
"Burton, I got it. I got it."

22:43.195 --> 22:45.989
[commentator]
ASU should be able to build on this lead.

22:46.573 --> 22:49.618
But instead, there's Hedake
with a personal foul.

22:50.494 --> 22:54.414
Now Oregon State has it once again.
Suddenly, their confidence builds.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.125
But then,
when the second half rolled around,

22:57.751 --> 22:59.920
literally the magic started happening.

23:00.962 --> 23:02.339
[commentator] Three on two.

23:02.881 --> 23:06.635
Result: an easy basket
to Stephane Brown. Score.

23:07.886 --> 23:11.515
ASU should be dominating, but instead
they're letting this lead slip away.

23:12.265 --> 23:16.061
[Dwayne] Oregon State comin' back
on us like that and I'm thinking,

23:16.561 --> 23:18.814
"Maybe I'm stinking it up out here. Maybe…

23:18.897 --> 23:22.818
Mario, maybe Isaac or Ron,
maybe they're stinking it up.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.403
"But it's not Hedake."

23:24.903 --> 23:26.405
He's out here to win tonight.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.657
[commentator] Hedake. Yes!

23:28.740 --> 23:30.200
[crowd cheering]

23:31.576 --> 23:35.914
Hedake bullseye on the three.
The Sun Devils lead by six.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.000
[Ice] I was always looking
at the scoreboard.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.752
I would keep looking up at the scoreboard.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.755
That's the only thing I was worried about.

23:43.839 --> 23:48.510
Remember, I was the point guard.
Point guard is the main player.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.680
The one to bring the ball up the court.
Point guard is the quarterback,

23:51.763 --> 23:52.722
the pitcher.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.850
So, I was in control.

23:58.895 --> 24:01.731
[commentator]
Poor passing right there. Very sloppy.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.234
[Hedake] I had different techniques.

24:05.068 --> 24:09.281
You can take your time, walk the ball
up the court, shot clock going down.

24:09.865 --> 24:10.991
Start the offense late.

24:11.741 --> 24:15.078
I knew what situation
to put certain players in

24:15.162 --> 24:16.746
so they couldn't score.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.958
[commentator] Riley launches the three
and has it go off the rim.

24:20.041 --> 24:24.671
It has been a sloppy performance tonight
by ASU with the exception of Hedake Smith.

24:24.754 --> 24:26.965
-Brown puts it up.
-[buzzer sounding]

24:27.048 --> 24:29.176
And there's the buzzer, ending the play.

24:30.218 --> 24:33.263
Hedake Smith
with a monster performance tonight.

24:33.346 --> 24:34.764
Thirty-nine points.

24:37.142 --> 24:42.063
Finally, the final score
with the big F next to it

24:42.147 --> 24:43.523
scrolled across the ticker.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.444
[commentator]
Final score of 88 to 82.

24:48.945 --> 24:52.657
And sure enough, they won by six.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.578
Exactly what I told Hedake
it needed to be.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.958
I mean, was I shocked? Hell yeah.

25:02.042 --> 25:05.086
I mean, I could not even fathom

25:06.254 --> 25:10.133
the thought that Hedake would be able
to get that game to land right on six.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.720
But this guy had enough skill
to make it happen.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.808
Not gonna lie, a million dollars in cash?

25:18.892 --> 25:20.644
Yeah, it's-it's intoxicating.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.605
Twenty thousand, as a college kid?

25:23.688 --> 25:26.441
Oh, man. Fucking amazing.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.193
[laughing]

25:28.944 --> 25:32.656
I mean, it was for me--
I was like, "Man, this is-- Woo-hoo!"

25:32.739 --> 25:37.786
"This is the life," 'cause it was easy.
It was easy. That was an easy payday.

25:38.286 --> 25:40.914
Well, congratulations, 39 points.
You have to feel good.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.249
[laughing]

25:43.083 --> 25:46.294
I just scored 39 points,
and we won the game.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.129
Just all about winning.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.506
Long as you winnin'…

25:51.800 --> 25:54.052
nobody ever suspect nothing.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.722
[crickets chirping]

25:59.724 --> 26:01.518
[Joe] The day after game one,

26:01.601 --> 26:04.729
I woke up bright and early
and hit the streets in Vegas, again.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.190
I knew I only had one game left.

26:08.024 --> 26:11.444
So, my mindset
was to maximize the money that I had.

26:12.529 --> 26:16.449
How do I take my 1.2
and get the biggest bang for that buck?

26:16.950 --> 26:20.620
How can I do it better?
Bigger, better and smarter.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.455
[fast-paced jazz music playing]

26:24.874 --> 26:26.042
By a stroke of luck,

26:26.126 --> 26:31.590
it just happened to be the day before
the gambler's biggest holy day there is,

26:31.673 --> 26:33.258
which is Super Bowl Sunday.

26:33.341 --> 26:35.176
[cheering, whooping]

26:35.885 --> 26:37.470
Vegas was an absolute madhouse.

26:38.638 --> 26:41.391
The Dallas Cowboys
were playing the Buffalo Bills…

26:42.892 --> 26:45.312
and there was just a lot of money in town.

26:48.940 --> 26:52.902
To my knowledge, we were completely
flying under the radar.

26:53.945 --> 26:57.699
And between the help of my dad
and his two friends,

26:58.700 --> 27:02.871
I ended up successfully getting off
about $1.2 million in bets…

27:03.455 --> 27:04.789
on Oregon.

27:05.832 --> 27:09.085
Line opened up about 12, 12 and a half,

27:09.919 --> 27:11.755
but once again, I spoke with Hedake

27:12.422 --> 27:16.384
and once again, I gave him a lower number
as my margin of error.

27:16.885 --> 27:20.722
I said, "I don't care what you do,
how you do it."

27:21.806 --> 27:25.769
"You could lose the game for all I care,
but if you win the game…

27:26.311 --> 27:28.605
-just don't win by more than--"
-Six.

27:28.688 --> 27:30.273
The magic number was six.

27:30.774 --> 27:31.650
Let's go.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.993
[commentator] Crowd of seven to 8,000
here at the Activity Center on their feet

27:42.077 --> 27:45.038
cheering the introduction
of the Arizona State Sun Devils.

27:45.121 --> 27:47.332
Certain that
they will have to play a lot better

27:47.415 --> 27:49.084
than they did the other night.

27:50.502 --> 27:57.467
For the Oregon game, I could honestly say
thoughts of concern went through my mind.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.804
"Oh, my gosh.
What if Hedake has a bad day?"

28:02.472 --> 28:06.726
And so, I told Benny to go to the game
and sit right behind the ASU bench.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.355
Just to act as a constant reminder

28:10.438 --> 28:13.525
so Hedake could understand
that he had to perform.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.696
But once again,
it didn't start out very well.

28:18.988 --> 28:21.574
[commentator]
Fontana now goes baseline and scores.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.494
-Fontana the lob to Mario…
-[whistle blows]

28:26.079 --> 28:27.580
Mario said, "Look what I found."

28:28.164 --> 28:29.165
And Riley for three.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.292
[crowd cheering]

28:31.376 --> 28:33.503
[Dwayne] We're up 15 points,

28:33.586 --> 28:37.757
and our leading scorer
hasn't scored one point.

28:38.633 --> 28:41.177
He's not the usual aggressive Hedake.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.138
[commentator] Hedake.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.725
-[crowd ooh's]
-[commentator] Can't get it to fall.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.399
[Hedake] Problem was Mario Bennett,

28:54.482 --> 29:00.113
Dwayne Fontana, Ron Riley,
they was playing well,

29:00.864 --> 29:03.783
and it was just hard to control the game.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.163
[Joe] At that point,
it didn't look promising.

29:09.456 --> 29:12.709
ASU had a double-digit lead.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.795
[commentator]
The Arizona State lead now 18.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.549
[Hedake] In my mind,
I'm thinking enough is enough.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.844
It's time to, you know, turn it around.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.932
[commentator]
Hedake being hounded this half by Parker.

29:28.516 --> 29:31.311
And Oregon almost forces a steal there
and Hedake--

29:31.394 --> 29:32.771
-[whistle blowing]
-Uh-oh.

29:33.396 --> 29:34.773
Oh, my goodness.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.192
[Joe] And then it got a lot worse.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.027
[commentator] Hedake Smith is down.

29:39.819 --> 29:43.740
Hedake, what looked to be pretty severely,
twisted his ankle.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.492
And he was taken out of the game.

29:47.243 --> 29:49.078
[commentator]
Let's take a look at that play.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.956
[Hedake] That was a freak accident.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.293
I mean, as you saw,
my ankle buckled and I went down.

29:58.546 --> 29:59.881
It was a lot of pain.

30:02.133 --> 30:06.888
And, in my mind, I'm thinking,
"It's off, the fix off."

30:07.889 --> 30:09.057
I can't play.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.353
[commentator]
Hedake heads to the dressing room.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.606
[Joe] So, was I nervous about the bet?

30:17.732 --> 30:19.776
You better believe I am.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.738
Without Hedake on the court,
the other players for ASU

30:23.822 --> 30:27.367
could just start ripping it up
and beat the snot out of 'em that night.

30:28.618 --> 30:30.495
That's when I got nervous.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.705
That's when I got really nervous.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.707
'Cause, okay, now it's my time.

30:34.791 --> 30:38.419
You know, it's my time to do it,
if it comes down to it.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.338
[producer] Did you want to do it?

30:41.631 --> 30:42.465
No.

30:44.425 --> 30:48.429
That was--
That's when I really got worried,

30:48.513 --> 30:50.056
because I told them,

30:50.139 --> 30:53.393
"It's the last game.
You know, I know what's at stake."

30:53.476 --> 30:54.727
[comm] Bennett with the follow.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.814
I got to get back out there,
I gotta control the game.

31:00.817 --> 31:04.946
[commentator] We have good news to report.
Hedake's ankle has been heavily taped.

31:05.029 --> 31:08.032
He has put on a new pair
of high-top sneakers,

31:08.116 --> 31:12.871
and there you see Stevin Smith,
back to give it a try in the second half.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.623
[Hedake] Growing up in the ghetto,

31:15.707 --> 31:18.376
you have to be able to survive
where you at, you know.

31:19.752 --> 31:25.675
I'm not gonna say I was no damn hit man
or no, you know, big time fighter,

31:25.758 --> 31:27.343
but I had survival skills.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.681
And so, we went out the second half
and did what we had to do.

31:32.181 --> 31:34.726
[commentator] That pass for Smith
stolen by Darryl Parker.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.394
Who finishes with a flourish.

31:37.312 --> 31:41.649
[Joe] Hedake and Isaac were still fighting
to protect what they had promised to do

31:41.733 --> 31:44.277
-and what they were getting paid to do.
-[comm] Hedake.

31:45.486 --> 31:47.196
-Oh! No basket.
-[crowd ooh's]

31:47.739 --> 31:50.158
Orlando Williams. That's a two-pointer.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.619
Darryl Parker. Hit the three.

31:53.202 --> 31:55.788
Parker. And he hits again.

31:55.872 --> 31:59.542
Out of nowhere,
the Ducks have ripped off ten points.

32:00.209 --> 32:04.756
It was-- It was a relief, you know.

32:05.423 --> 32:09.469
We was gonna do this, and then it's over.

32:11.471 --> 32:15.058
[commentator]
Hedake getting it to Fontana… Yes!

32:19.062 --> 32:21.481
Once again, landed on six.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.695
So, I ended up cashing the tickets,

32:27.779 --> 32:30.615
and it was about a little north
of two and a half million bucks,

32:31.240 --> 32:34.202
all in, by the time game two finished.

32:34.285 --> 32:37.830
Once again, you know, I was 20,000 richer.

32:38.915 --> 32:42.377
After we did it,
I got paid again that night.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.129
I was up. Up, up, up.

32:47.465 --> 32:50.093
I would just wake up in the morning
and go shop.

32:51.094 --> 32:56.557
Cell phone, clothes, earrings,
food for everybody.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.935
My car, I hooked my car up.

32:59.435 --> 33:00.853
That green Toyota Tercel.

33:00.937 --> 33:06.859
It went from nothing to limo tint,
alarm, music, rims, everything.

33:08.069 --> 33:11.239
I didn't save a dime. I spent all of it.

33:11.781 --> 33:16.577
And I started buying all type of shoes,
had big rope chains,

33:16.661 --> 33:19.956
you had big old watch,
bought me two big old diamonds.

33:20.540 --> 33:24.752
Put a payment down on a GMC Typhoon.
That was like a $30,000 car.

33:25.878 --> 33:30.383
[Ice] It was dark gray and it faded
to a light gray. Triple gold Daytons,

33:30.466 --> 33:33.886
and then it came with a chip in it
where the tires don't screech.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.680
-[engine revs]
-It just takes off.

33:36.556 --> 33:39.767
Great times at Arizona State. Great times.

33:40.601 --> 33:42.603
[producer]
Did you basically spend all of the money?

33:42.687 --> 33:44.188
[laughs]

33:45.815 --> 33:47.442
[Dwayne] I never asked any questions.

33:48.943 --> 33:51.863
I think we drew our own conclusions.

33:51.946 --> 33:55.950
I believed it was
because of a sports agent

33:56.617 --> 33:58.286
advancing him some money.

33:59.037 --> 33:59.996
Did I feel like…

34:02.248 --> 34:04.584
I could be, you know, be caught?

34:05.501 --> 34:09.338
I didn't think I'd be touched at the time.
You know, we were superstars.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.842
-[producer] So, you had no worries?
-Not at all.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.473
[birds chirping]

34:20.558 --> 34:23.936
[Kent] It was around the time
of that Oregon game.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.855
Maybe a couple of days afterwards.

34:26.647 --> 34:28.232
I received a message.

34:29.317 --> 34:33.863
And it said something like, you know,
"You might wanna check out Hedake Smith."

34:33.946 --> 34:36.324
"There's something going on
at Arizona State."

34:36.824 --> 34:41.746
"He's all of a sudden flush with cash,
driving a nice car."

34:43.164 --> 34:46.751
You know. And I think he made a reference
to point shaving.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.129
I just thought,
"Wow. Why would Hedake do this

34:50.213 --> 34:52.715
when he's a shoo-in for the NBA?"

34:53.883 --> 34:55.510
It didn't make a lot of sense.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.806
But I started thinking as a reporter if--

34:59.889 --> 35:03.434
You know, "If this is true, this is huge."

35:04.060 --> 35:05.228
Massive story.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.194
[Joe]
After game two, I flew back to Chicago.

35:13.986 --> 35:15.822
I'm back inside my life,

35:16.322 --> 35:21.369
and, um, I truly believed,
with every fiber of my body,

35:21.452 --> 35:22.537
I was done.

35:23.037 --> 35:26.499
It's what Hedake and I talked about
on the initial call,

35:26.582 --> 35:28.000
two games and I'm done,

35:28.835 --> 35:30.002
it's what I believed.

35:32.171 --> 35:34.006
[phone ringing]

35:38.886 --> 35:41.347
[Joe] Until one day, I get a phone call.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.851
And it's Hedake Smith.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.478
I'm like, "What the heck?"

35:48.020 --> 35:51.232
And he caught me off guard.
I didn't even know he knew my number.

35:52.692 --> 35:55.695
He said, "Hey, we're playing UCLA
tomorrow night,

35:56.112 --> 35:58.739
and I wanna bet on myself. Can you do it?"

36:00.158 --> 36:01.492
I said, "Are you serious?"

36:01.951 --> 36:04.370
I said, "How much you looking
to put down on yourself?"

36:04.954 --> 36:07.123
He said, "I wanna bet 20,000 on myself."

36:08.499 --> 36:11.210
I said, "Do you have the money
to pay me if you lose?"

36:12.879 --> 36:16.174
And he said to me immediately,
"I'm not gonna lose."

36:16.924 --> 36:18.509
But I knew in my gut:

36:18.593 --> 36:20.720
the guy spent all his money.

36:20.803 --> 36:23.264
And if UCLA wins that game…

36:24.432 --> 36:25.975
his only way to repay me

36:26.475 --> 36:30.271
is to perform for the USC game
that's coming up two days later.

36:30.354 --> 36:31.772
[producer] Fix another game?

36:33.274 --> 36:35.484
So, I said, "Okay. Fair enough."

36:35.568 --> 36:38.738
"You got ASU plus four
tomorrow night for 22,000."

36:38.821 --> 36:41.991
"You lose, I'll talk to you later."
That was the end of the conversation.

36:42.074 --> 36:42.992
[phone beeps]

36:43.075 --> 36:46.495
Man, that's a bunch of bullshit.

36:47.079 --> 36:50.124
-[producer] Really?
-Really. Big facts.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.669
[Joe] Hedake has denied the bet
all the way through,

36:55.004 --> 36:55.963
but, um…

36:58.549 --> 36:59.592
it happened.

37:00.134 --> 37:01.052
It happened.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.150
[Joe] I think UCLA at the time was
one of the best teams in the nation.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.110
They were absolute studs.

37:19.779 --> 37:23.282
But I knew Hedake
was playing for survival.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.827
Playing for survival, betting on himself.

37:28.412 --> 37:32.208
For Hedake's bet,
UCLA was favored by four points.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.044
That means Arizona State
could win the game outright

37:35.127 --> 37:38.714
and eke out a winner no matter what,
but if they did lose the game,

37:38.798 --> 37:40.883
just don't lose by more than four.

37:40.967 --> 37:44.428
So, if they lost by one, two or three,
he would be a winner.

37:47.348 --> 37:50.142
[Hedake] UCLA was always tough.

37:50.226 --> 37:55.481
You know, they had one of the top coaches
and some damn good players.

37:56.565 --> 37:58.234
So, it was a dogfight.

37:59.485 --> 38:03.281
Look, this was a taste
of what NBA would be like.

38:03.364 --> 38:06.826
And I was gonna take them down.

38:07.535 --> 38:08.911
[comm 1] Here comes Hedake.

38:09.495 --> 38:11.747
-[comm 2] Hedake.
-Here's the lob to Bennett…

38:11.831 --> 38:13.207
-[comm 2] Hello.
-Yes.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.667
[announcer] Hedake Smith!

38:15.626 --> 38:18.504
[Ice] Before UCLA,
I asked him, "Can I do it?"

38:18.587 --> 38:20.506
"You gonna do it this game?"
He said, "No."

38:20.589 --> 38:21.882
He ain't doing it.

38:21.966 --> 38:22.800
Like, okay.

38:23.843 --> 38:24.760
[comm 1] Smith.

38:25.678 --> 38:29.140
[comm 2] You could tell when he got it
in his hand he was gonna let it fly.

38:29.223 --> 38:30.933
-Bye-bye.
-[comm 1] Three in a row…

38:31.017 --> 38:32.184
Yes, indeed!

38:32.268 --> 38:33.227
[cheering]

38:33.311 --> 38:36.605
-[comm 2] Bring out the Aspirin.
-[comm 1] He's got 22 points.

38:37.189 --> 38:41.402
Hedake, he played his ass off.
He played a phenomenal game.

38:41.986 --> 38:46.824
It was pretty much a tie game
back and forth the entire game.

38:46.907 --> 38:47.742
[comm 1] Brewer.

38:47.825 --> 38:51.329
[Joe] Now remember, Hedake's out there
trying not to lose by more than four.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.372
[comm 1] We're tied at 70!

38:53.873 --> 38:55.541
[comm 2] Oh, it's heating up now.

38:56.500 --> 39:00.004
[Joe] The last minute or two of the game,
UCLA went up by two.

39:00.087 --> 39:01.339
[comm 1] Dollar. Two points.

39:02.048 --> 39:03.632
Ed O'Bannon. Yes.

39:04.258 --> 39:05.176
[Joe] And then by four.

39:05.259 --> 39:08.554
[comm 1] Zidek, he had one there earlier.
He does it again!

39:09.055 --> 39:13.184
Six point game now. UCLA's up by six.
And, oh, by the way,

39:13.267 --> 39:15.311
there's one second left on the clock.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.147
The game's over. No ma--

39:18.230 --> 39:21.317
There's no six point field goal
that's gonna tie the game.

39:23.235 --> 39:25.780
So, the only player
out of those ten people

39:25.863 --> 39:28.699
on the court that was motivated,
was Hedake.

39:29.658 --> 39:35.539
Now all of a sudden,
Hedake really asking for the ball.

39:35.623 --> 39:38.125
Like maybe wanting to get another shot up.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.544
At-at that moment,

39:41.587 --> 39:43.756
all I want to do is just get one score.

39:45.549 --> 39:46.884
That's all I wanted to do.

39:49.095 --> 39:51.889
[Joe] And with that,
Hedake sprints up the court.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.309
[Ice] I mean, he dribbled hard and fast.

39:56.685 --> 40:00.106
And I'm thinking,
"Huh? It's already a loss."

40:02.024 --> 40:04.527
[Joe] Hedake plants
behind the three point line

40:05.111 --> 40:07.279
and fires a three-pointer.

40:25.589 --> 40:28.467
-[buzzer sounding]
-[comm 1] Hedake takes the last shot

40:28.551 --> 40:32.763
as UCLA comes up with a 76-70 victory.

40:34.723 --> 40:38.477
[Joe] And you see Hedake
just absolutely dejected.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.689
He seemed distraught about it.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.066
Like, who cares, Hedake?

40:44.150 --> 40:46.902
Like, we wouldn't have won
if you made the shot.

40:46.986 --> 40:51.073
Now, to everyone else, who the heck cares?

40:51.782 --> 40:54.201
Because the game would've went
from six to three.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.871
But if ASU would've only lost by three,

40:57.663 --> 40:59.957
Hedake doesn't lose $22,000.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.461
Everybody knew me as Hedake.

41:06.213 --> 41:09.091
But my mom, people that really know me,

41:09.758 --> 41:12.928
my church members, they knew Stevin Smith.

41:15.181 --> 41:17.308
Pretty much, Hedake was a character.

41:18.934 --> 41:20.269
Basketball player.

41:22.104 --> 41:23.063
College superstar.

41:24.106 --> 41:27.860
Hedake got Stevin Smith in trouble.

41:31.530 --> 41:33.032
[Joe] At that moment in time,

41:33.657 --> 41:37.995
I look at Hedake
and it's just everything changed with him.

41:38.871 --> 41:40.164
His shoulders slumped.

41:40.789 --> 41:43.125
The look of dejection on his face,

41:43.792 --> 41:48.547
'cause now he knows that Benny and I
have got him for the game on Saturday.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.258
He's ours for Saturday.

41:59.099 --> 42:01.060
[commentator] An obvious carry violation.

42:01.143 --> 42:04.063
[Kent] I started calling
people I knew connected to the program,

42:04.146 --> 42:05.022
people at the school,

42:05.856 --> 42:08.567
anybody I could find
and kind of run this…

42:09.610 --> 42:13.280
call behind them, say,
"Hey, I got this-this tip."

42:13.781 --> 42:16.867
"I'm hearing Hedake
might be involved with point shaving."

42:17.368 --> 42:18.369
"What's going on?"

42:19.370 --> 42:24.124
Um, but I could just
never nail anything down.

42:24.792 --> 42:27.586
It just came up empty at every turn.

42:31.840 --> 42:35.427
[Joe] It was Saturday,
the date of the USC game.

42:36.679 --> 42:37.930
I'm back in Vegas,

42:38.013 --> 42:40.099
I got Hedake completely locked in.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.435
But I knew I had my work cut out for me.

42:43.519 --> 42:47.273
Because this time,
there was no Super Bowl to back me up,

42:47.356 --> 42:49.316
no big money in town.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.278
How do I not get caught?
How do I stay under the radar?

42:53.445 --> 42:55.864
But I had
two and half million bucks with me

42:55.948 --> 42:57.575
to bet on USC.

42:58.576 --> 43:01.870
I also knew the betting line
that I was gonna bet on

43:01.954 --> 43:03.455
was right around 11.

43:04.248 --> 43:09.962
So, there was no way not to move that line
betting that kind of money.

43:10.921 --> 43:15.092
That's because when a massive
amount of money is put on one side,

43:15.718 --> 43:17.011
the line changes.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.305
So, when I bet that money,

43:19.930 --> 43:23.017
I moved that betting line down to six.

43:26.020 --> 43:29.815
That was the first time
I felt I attracted attention.

43:30.649 --> 43:33.527
I felt like with that line movement,

43:33.611 --> 43:36.155
with the questions that were being asked

43:36.238 --> 43:39.325
every time I walked up
to a sports book counter to make a bet,

43:40.200 --> 43:42.703
um, I felt there was some exposure there.

43:53.213 --> 43:57.176
[Ice] Against USC, Hedake told me
that we was point shaving again.

43:57.926 --> 44:00.054
I said, "Okay. I'm doing this."

44:01.430 --> 44:02.931
"Let's get some more money."

44:03.807 --> 44:05.309
[comm] Here comes Hedake Smith.

44:05.809 --> 44:10.397
And Isaac Burton brings it across
and SC with a steal.

44:11.815 --> 44:14.360
[Joe] I really didn't care
if Arizona State lost,

44:14.443 --> 44:16.904
as long as they didn't win
by six points or more.

44:17.780 --> 44:19.198
That's where I needed to be.

44:19.698 --> 44:20.824
[comm] Harris has three.

44:20.908 --> 44:23.744
Harris is gonna have to do something here.
Nice dish.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.121
Look at that crash!

44:26.705 --> 44:30.542
[laughing] Oh, Jones.
SC has a ten-point lead.

44:31.752 --> 44:34.922
I remember that game just being terrible.

44:35.756 --> 44:39.343
It was an awful game,
was a stinker of all stinks.

44:40.135 --> 44:42.054
And Hedake really didn't play well.

44:43.972 --> 44:45.224
[commentator]
Another bad pass.

44:47.017 --> 44:49.770
[Hedake] USC, they just kicked our ass.

44:50.396 --> 44:52.564
They came out, you know,
it was one of them days

44:52.648 --> 44:54.233
where you can't buy a bucket.

44:54.316 --> 44:55.693
[comm] Hedake Smith.

44:57.194 --> 44:58.946
Hedake Smith has not scored yet.

44:59.029 --> 45:00.364
[fans chanting]

45:00.447 --> 45:02.783
[Ice] Whenever your point guard,
he's not playing well,

45:03.534 --> 45:04.993
your team is going to suffer.

45:05.703 --> 45:08.163
and if your point guard is point shaving,

45:08.247 --> 45:11.166
your team is really gonna suffer.
It's just simple as that.

45:13.585 --> 45:14.503
[whistle blows]

45:14.586 --> 45:18.048
[comm] And a charge on Hedake Smith!
And he is gone.

45:22.553 --> 45:26.473
[Dwayne] It definitely feels at this point
that the team is fractured.

45:26.974 --> 45:32.146
And that really hurt me
because of the effort that I put forth

45:32.229 --> 45:33.313
every night.

45:33.897 --> 45:36.400
And at this point, I'm thinking,

45:37.192 --> 45:40.237
"Why do I do this to myself?
Nobody else cares."

45:43.574 --> 45:46.702
[Joe] I don't know if it was Hedake
having a bad day

45:46.785 --> 45:48.704
or Hedake taking the easy way out,

45:49.621 --> 45:51.123
but USC won the game outright.

45:52.791 --> 45:55.127
So, it didn't matter
what the betting line was.

45:55.836 --> 45:58.714
The underdog had won,
and I had another winner.

46:07.556 --> 46:09.516
[Hedake]
I've never liked losing, you know.

46:10.559 --> 46:14.772
But every time you get a paper bag
full of hundreds, it's addictive.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.316
It changed me.

46:18.525 --> 46:19.610
It changed me.

46:21.779 --> 46:24.907
[producer] Did you ever feel, like,
"Maybe we should stop now"?

46:26.742 --> 46:29.620
I mean, we only had a couple games
left in the season. [chuckles]

46:30.537 --> 46:33.040
If you look at it,
it was at the end of the season.

46:40.756 --> 46:43.258
[Joe] I was completely convinced
at that point…

46:45.928 --> 46:48.222
that this-this-this party's over.

46:48.305 --> 46:51.934
I had five million bucks
in a safe deposit box,

46:52.893 --> 46:54.436
twenty-three years old.

46:55.062 --> 46:58.690
What else could I possibly need
or want at that point?

46:58.774 --> 47:00.651
[phone ringing]

47:05.239 --> 47:08.158
A week later, um, I get a call from Benny.

47:09.117 --> 47:12.329
He said, "Joe, I'm in trouble."
I said, "What do you mean?"

47:13.455 --> 47:15.958
He said, "There's a guy out here
by the name of Big Red."

47:16.583 --> 47:19.336
"He's about 550, 600 pounds with red hair,

47:19.878 --> 47:22.256
and he's a drug dealer out here
and he's a bookmaker."

47:22.840 --> 47:25.384
"He found out what I was doing,
and he wants in."

47:26.176 --> 47:28.011
"He wants in on another game."

47:29.763 --> 47:33.267
"And we think the Washington game
coming up is the next game to do it."

47:34.893 --> 47:37.938
I said,
"Benny, you're-you're playing with fire."

47:38.021 --> 47:41.942
"You have no idea of the challenges
and what you're up against."

47:42.734 --> 47:44.069
"You're gonna mess it up."

47:49.366 --> 47:51.243
But then I ended up thinking,

47:51.326 --> 47:55.455
"Okay, these guys are gonna do this
with or without me."

47:58.917 --> 48:03.422
"And if they do it without me
and get caught, I'm screwed."

48:06.508 --> 48:11.179
And in my mind there was no way
in the world I could let that happen.

48:12.681 --> 48:14.349
[fast-paced music playing]

48:14.433 --> 48:18.562
So, the next morning, bright and early,
I flew out from Chicago to Vegas.

48:18.645 --> 48:20.772
I didn't really want to be there.

48:22.316 --> 48:24.943
But then I rationalized it by saying,

48:25.027 --> 48:29.740
"Ten million dollars in cash
sounded so much better than five million."

48:32.618 --> 48:36.121
[Hedake] For the Washington game,
the stakes changed.

48:36.747 --> 48:39.166
Benny told me
he was gonna take the $20,000 dollars

48:39.249 --> 48:42.544
that he was gonna pay me
and put it on the game.

48:42.628 --> 48:45.839
That way, you know, we could make 40.

48:47.257 --> 48:50.052
[Joe] I start going
to the same 20 different casinos,

48:50.719 --> 48:52.471
but this time it just felt different.

48:52.554 --> 48:56.016
Because there was supposedly
some heavy betting going on.

48:57.142 --> 48:59.394
I was at the Mirage, um…

49:00.312 --> 49:03.231
making a bet for 9,900 on Washington,

49:04.149 --> 49:08.236
and the ticket writer says to me,
"Hey, Joe,

49:08.320 --> 49:12.532
there was just some big 600-pound guy
in here with red hair

49:13.033 --> 49:15.035
that just bet on Washington, too."

49:15.118 --> 49:18.080
"Plus, there's kids all around town
with ASU shirts

49:18.747 --> 49:21.583
that are betting $20 bills
like they know the final score."

49:23.961 --> 49:25.462
And at the point I knew.

49:25.545 --> 49:27.381
The cat was out of the bag.

49:28.507 --> 49:29.508
I'm in trouble.

49:31.843 --> 49:34.346
[Hedake]
He would normally call me and give me,

49:34.429 --> 49:38.016
you know, the number before the game.

49:38.100 --> 49:42.479
But this time, he kept moving:
eight, seven, six, five.

49:44.064 --> 49:46.858
[Joe] Laying off that money
was a monumental task.

49:47.693 --> 49:49.945
I ended up getting off
three million bucks,

49:50.862 --> 49:53.281
but moved the line significantly.

49:54.658 --> 49:58.578
It started out at 12.
And it kept moving down.

49:59.830 --> 50:05.252
I had the bulk of the money bet
on Washington as a seven-point underdog.

50:06.086 --> 50:09.756
But at the end of the day,
that line ended up dropping down to three.

50:11.591 --> 50:14.177
So, a nine-point movement in one day,

50:14.845 --> 50:16.471
um, in a few hours…

50:17.222 --> 50:18.348
I knew was not good.

50:29.776 --> 50:35.032
Typically, a line changes maybe ten times
before the game is played.

50:35.115 --> 50:39.453
But before the Washington game,
the line changed 44 times.

50:41.913 --> 50:44.541
That alerted the authorities.
There's something wrong.

50:44.624 --> 50:47.002
This is unusual, something's going on.

50:47.085 --> 50:50.213
Now, they didn't know what it was,
nobody knew what it was.

50:50.964 --> 50:53.675
Um, but it alerted the authorities

50:53.759 --> 50:56.845
and the Nevada Gaming Commission
then contacted the FBI,

50:57.387 --> 51:01.266
said, "Hey, there's something screwy
going on here."

51:01.767 --> 51:03.435
"Why don't you take a look at it."

51:09.483 --> 51:11.485
[somber music playing]

51:11.568 --> 51:13.153
[comm] Let's talk about Arizona State.

51:13.236 --> 51:16.364
What has happened to the Sun Devils
the last couple of weeks?

51:16.448 --> 51:18.492
Through injuries, poor shooting,

51:18.575 --> 51:20.952
I don't know, turnovers,
the team hasn't been the same.

51:21.620 --> 51:24.414
[Ice] That Washington game,
I wasn't even involved.

51:24.998 --> 51:28.502
Hedake didn't say nothing about it.
He never mentioned it, not one time.

51:30.003 --> 51:31.338
[Joe] For the Washington game,

51:31.421 --> 51:34.382
I only had Hedake,
and that scared the heck out of me.

51:35.467 --> 51:37.886
Because if Arizona State
played up to their ability,

51:37.969 --> 51:40.597
they could easily win
by more than seven.

51:41.473 --> 51:45.352
So, once again, I wanted to have a cushion

51:46.520 --> 51:48.105
for Hedake's margin of error.

51:49.731 --> 51:52.192
So, probably a couple hours
before the game,

51:53.235 --> 51:55.153
I made it clear to him,

51:55.987 --> 51:59.282
in no uncertain terms, what he had to do.

51:59.866 --> 52:02.077
"We've both got a lot of money at stake,

52:02.702 --> 52:05.539
you have to make this game land on three."

52:09.000 --> 52:11.962
[Hedake] At that moment,
there was no turning back.

52:13.547 --> 52:16.466
Hedake didn't know when to say,
you know, enough is enough.

52:18.176 --> 52:20.262
Hedake felt he was untouchable.

52:22.389 --> 52:24.266
Felt like he was bigger than the law.

52:24.349 --> 52:26.977
[loud tapping on ball]

52:27.060 --> 52:28.520
[crowd cheering]

52:29.855 --> 52:31.106
[commentator] All right.

52:31.189 --> 52:35.402
So, here we go. Washington in purple,
Arizona State in yellow.

52:35.485 --> 52:39.489
And Stevin Smith is the major star
for the Sun Devils, keep your eye on him.

52:43.201 --> 52:45.078
[Joe] After all the bets were made,

52:45.162 --> 52:50.500
I was just mentally
and physically fatigued.

52:52.419 --> 52:57.632
So, I went up to the hotel room,
and I turned on the ASU game.

52:59.551 --> 53:02.554
And it was the perfect scenario.

53:03.430 --> 53:07.100
[commentator] Washington has
the early lead. Backdoor, Tyrus, nice.

53:08.018 --> 53:09.686
Jumper. Good!

53:10.562 --> 53:13.523
Nice move. Maurice Woods, softly done.

53:13.607 --> 53:18.153
Early on, it appears that Washington
has more energy than Arizona State.

53:19.196 --> 53:22.282
[Dwayne]
The first half was a total let down.

53:22.365 --> 53:23.491
Total disaster.

53:24.075 --> 53:26.661
I remember getting down big, early.

53:27.162 --> 53:29.331
And nothing was falling,

53:30.624 --> 53:35.378
uh, it was just a terrible,
terrible performance in the first half.

53:35.962 --> 53:38.798
[commentator] Fontana. No bucket.

53:38.882 --> 53:41.551
Isaac Burton. Stops. In and out.

53:42.177 --> 53:44.512
Hedake. NBA. Too long.

53:44.596 --> 53:47.390
So far, nothing has gone right
for Arizona State.

53:47.474 --> 53:49.142
[crowd booing]

53:49.768 --> 53:51.770
So, the fans are booing the Sun Devils.

53:52.604 --> 53:54.773
Losing to Washington in the first half?

53:55.941 --> 53:57.692
It was fucking terrible.

53:58.944 --> 54:02.614
But $40,000 dollars,
that's a lot of damn money.

54:04.241 --> 54:05.408
[whistle blowing]

54:05.492 --> 54:08.453
[commentator] And that is
an offensive foul by Hedake Smith.

54:11.164 --> 54:13.375
Fifteen to six, Washington is up.

54:14.334 --> 54:17.545
[Joe] As long as that game stayed
as Washington winning

54:17.629 --> 54:19.464
or stayed within six points,

54:19.547 --> 54:21.091
I knew I would be okay.

54:21.967 --> 54:24.719
And so, I'm sitting on the bed,
I'm thinking through these scenarios,

54:24.803 --> 54:28.473
and I just literally start falling asleep.

54:28.556 --> 54:30.600
[muffled commentary]

54:30.684 --> 54:32.227
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

54:35.981 --> 54:38.191
Getting accepted to a major university

54:38.275 --> 54:41.152
could come down to who gets
the highest score on the SAT.

54:41.236 --> 54:44.364
Up Your Grades
can make that high score a reality.

54:45.573 --> 54:49.452
Woke up three, four hours later.

54:51.746 --> 54:54.165
And there was an infomercial
playing on the TV.

54:54.624 --> 54:55.625
[TV] …by Dr. Gary Gruber.

54:55.709 --> 54:59.087
[Joe] I had no idea who won the game.
Remember, this is 1994.

54:59.170 --> 55:04.426
There's no sports sites
that I could log onto and get a score.

55:05.135 --> 55:06.011
Um…

55:06.511 --> 55:07.846
So, I threw on a…

55:09.973 --> 55:13.768
shirt and baseball hat
and walked down to the sports book.

55:16.730 --> 55:21.776
Being involved in trading,
I was already used to taking risks.

55:22.235 --> 55:24.487
I knew that some of your trades
are gonna go bad.

55:25.071 --> 55:27.282
Hopefully,
the majority of your trades go good.

55:28.325 --> 55:30.785
But I felt good
the way the game had been flowing.

55:31.328 --> 55:34.039
It looked like ASU was just quitting.

55:34.122 --> 55:35.790
It looked like they had no heart,

55:35.874 --> 55:39.711
it looked like Washington
was gonna run all over 'em.

55:40.378 --> 55:42.839
So, I felt my money was good.

55:45.050 --> 55:47.010
And I remember
walking into that sports book

55:47.093 --> 55:48.720
and looking for the ASU score.

55:50.388 --> 55:54.184
And waiting for updates
to come across the ticker.

55:56.394 --> 55:58.646
In my mind, this was a done deal.

56:04.736 --> 56:06.738
[commentator]
And that's the end of the first half.

56:08.198 --> 56:12.118
Arizona State is doing everything it can
to throw this game away.

56:14.412 --> 56:17.999
We had a terrible first half.
A terrible first half.

56:18.917 --> 56:21.169
We was getting booed by our own fans.

56:23.546 --> 56:26.341
[Dwayne] So, now, going into half time,

56:27.258 --> 56:31.638
we're in the locker room
and Coach Frieder, he tears into us.

56:31.721 --> 56:35.016
He came in, cussing and shouting at me,

56:35.100 --> 56:37.685
telling me we had a couple
NBA scouts there that…

56:39.354 --> 56:42.482
they wasn't gonna look at me
because I'm playing like shit,

56:42.565 --> 56:46.194
and, "You're gonna mess up your career."

56:47.112 --> 56:50.698
That's when he said it.
"We received a call from the FBI."

56:50.782 --> 56:53.701
"They said this game
is under investigation."

56:55.078 --> 56:56.955
"Anybody have--"
I remember Bill Frieder saying,

56:57.038 --> 57:00.792
"Anybody have anything to do with it,
they better let me know now."

57:01.376 --> 57:02.836
"You better let me know now."

57:06.464 --> 57:10.343
Oh, shit. We done fucked up.

57:13.054 --> 57:15.765
[Hedake] The second half
was a terrifying moment,

57:15.849 --> 57:18.101
you know,
and I didn't want it to leak out.

57:19.561 --> 57:24.607
I just felt that I needed to do what I,
you know, had to do.

57:24.691 --> 57:28.987
That way, wouldn't be no speculations
about me being involved in anything.

57:31.656 --> 57:34.117
[commentator]
Stevin Smith, number 44 with the ball.

57:34.200 --> 57:36.619
[Hedake] I'm thinking,
"Let's just win this game

57:36.703 --> 57:38.580
and we'll deal
with the consequences later."

57:39.873 --> 57:41.040
[commentator] Hedake…

57:41.791 --> 57:43.084
-Got it!
-[crowd cheering]

57:43.585 --> 57:46.379
Stevin Smith. Here he goes.

57:46.463 --> 57:47.797
Oh, great tip.

57:48.548 --> 57:52.760
Arizona State starting to come alive here,
and the passion is back.

57:52.844 --> 57:55.305
[Joe] That's when I found out
that ASU and Hedake

57:55.388 --> 57:57.682
just stepped on 'em in the second half.

57:57.765 --> 58:00.059
He just sucked it up and played hard.

58:00.143 --> 58:02.187
[commentator] Hedake. Got it!

58:02.812 --> 58:04.481
[crowd cheering]

58:04.564 --> 58:07.442
-[buzzer sounding]
-And that's the end of the game.

58:08.109 --> 58:11.905
Arizona State,
a very impressive second half.

58:12.655 --> 58:16.075
[Joe] Hedake ended up
winning the game by 18 points.

58:18.161 --> 58:24.667
Which meant for me,
that every bet I had made was a loser.

58:26.753 --> 58:29.964
I just lost millions of dollars.

58:33.843 --> 58:35.303
And, oh, by the way,

58:35.845 --> 58:36.721
now…

58:38.181 --> 58:45.146
the worst case scenario with red flags
and attention is gonna happen.

58:51.027 --> 58:53.738
[thrilling music playing]

58:59.327 --> 59:00.870
Sure enough,

59:01.371 --> 59:06.167
starting that Monday,
there were a lot of stories about

59:06.751 --> 59:12.006
the unusual betting that occurred
on the ASU/Washington game.

59:12.632 --> 59:15.093
We're not talking about people
taking two dollar bets.

59:15.176 --> 59:19.389
We're talking about students
who are running operations in the tens

59:19.472 --> 59:21.057
and hundreds of thousands of dollars.

59:21.140 --> 59:23.017
[reporter] Have you talked
to your players about this?

59:23.101 --> 59:24.644
-[Frieder] Yeah.
-What's the feeling?

59:24.727 --> 59:27.522
They're-they're very upset about it,

59:27.605 --> 59:29.857
they seem to be very upset,
concerned, and…

59:30.483 --> 59:33.861
they've all assured me
that there's no involvement on their part.

59:34.362 --> 59:35.280
And I believe 'em.

59:37.073 --> 59:40.743
It was out now.
The season was over, and it was out.

59:40.827 --> 59:42.870
So, people would come up,
"Are you point shaving…?"

59:42.954 --> 59:45.623
"No… I didn't do that."
Of course, I'm gonna say no.

59:48.543 --> 59:54.549
I wasn't paying attention to the news,
but I'm done with it. [chuckles]

59:54.632 --> 59:55.883
It was behind me then.

1:00:01.723 --> 1:00:04.809
After the season finished, I head home.

1:00:06.352 --> 1:00:10.273
I withdrew from all my classes and left,
so I didn't graduate.

1:00:12.775 --> 1:00:15.194
But I felt like I had reached the top.

1:00:16.029 --> 1:00:19.407
I was the highest scorer
in Arizona State history.

1:00:19.490 --> 1:00:21.909
I won Male Athlete of the Year.

1:00:23.494 --> 1:00:25.163
So, I just knew I'd get drafted.

1:00:27.582 --> 1:00:33.546
[man] Welcome to the 1994 NBA Draft
at the Hoosier Dome.

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:35.298
[crowd cheering]

1:00:37.425 --> 1:00:40.845
[Dwayne] The NBA Draft
is when the NBA teams,

1:00:40.928 --> 1:00:45.141
they select the best
college basketball players in the country

1:00:45.725 --> 1:00:47.602
to come be on their team.

1:00:47.685 --> 1:00:52.357
So, we're all watching
'cause, you know, Hedake's our guy.

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:54.484
We wanna see him get drafted.

1:00:54.984 --> 1:00:56.486
I watched it at home.

1:00:56.569 --> 1:00:59.530
Back at home, me and my mother's house
back in Dallas.

1:00:59.614 --> 1:01:02.408
I had, you know, a lot of my friends over.

1:01:03.785 --> 1:01:06.454
We had balloons, food over there, music.

1:01:08.790 --> 1:01:10.375
This was gonna be the dream come true.

1:01:10.958 --> 1:01:11.876
Stay focused…

1:01:13.211 --> 1:01:14.462
it was about to happen.

1:01:15.963 --> 1:01:20.802
With the first pick in the 1994 NBA Draft,

1:01:21.761 --> 1:01:27.642
the Milwaukee Bucks select
Glenn Robinson from Purdue University.

1:01:27.725 --> 1:01:29.185
[crowd cheering]

1:01:29.268 --> 1:01:35.608
Jason Kidd, Grant Hill, Donyell Marshall,
Juwan Howard, Sharone Wright,

1:01:35.692 --> 1:01:38.778
Lamond Murray,
from the University of California.

1:01:41.364 --> 1:01:45.076
This concludes the draft.

1:01:45.868 --> 1:01:49.414
So, I'd like you to join me in welcoming…

1:01:51.374 --> 1:01:52.333
[sighs]

1:01:55.712 --> 1:01:57.588
When I hadn't got drafted, you know,

1:01:57.672 --> 1:01:59.924
a lot of things
started going through my head.

1:02:00.633 --> 1:02:05.722
Like, you know,
do they really know that it was me?

1:02:07.473 --> 1:02:10.309
Do they really know
what I had got caught up in?

1:02:16.357 --> 1:02:18.609
Do I think I got away with it
at that point?

1:02:20.653 --> 1:02:24.323
I was really just hoping
that everyone would stay quiet.

1:02:26.242 --> 1:02:27.910
Nothing would come out of it.

1:02:28.870 --> 1:02:29.746
Um…

1:02:30.246 --> 1:02:33.875
And hoping that it would just die down
as a rumor and speculation.

1:02:36.169 --> 1:02:38.004
[phone ringing]

1:02:41.174 --> 1:02:43.009
[phone ringing]

1:02:45.344 --> 1:02:46.763
[phone ringing]

1:02:47.930 --> 1:02:50.892
But then, one day, I get a phone call.

1:02:52.226 --> 1:02:53.811
And it's the FBI.

1:02:54.812 --> 1:02:58.232
They told me I was the subject

1:02:59.442 --> 1:03:06.032
and a target of a criminal prosecution
regarding the ASU matter.

1:03:08.993 --> 1:03:11.078
The FBI tracked down the money trail,

1:03:11.704 --> 1:03:15.291
and we were able to determine
that there was $8.7 million

1:03:15.374 --> 1:03:17.668
bet in fixed games.

1:03:18.544 --> 1:03:21.047
Joe Gagliano
absolutely knew what he was doing.

1:03:21.547 --> 1:03:24.383
And to put the effort in
to go to 15, 16 casinos,

1:03:24.467 --> 1:03:27.804
know how much money you had to lay down
and how much you couldn't lay down,

1:03:27.887 --> 1:03:29.430
it was very sophisticated.

1:03:30.306 --> 1:03:32.183
So, we knew he was the linchpin.

1:03:32.266 --> 1:03:33.976
We could prove his involvement,

1:03:34.060 --> 1:03:36.103
but then there were clearly…

1:03:36.854 --> 1:03:40.858
money transfers to Stevin "Hedake" Smith.

1:03:40.942 --> 1:03:42.693
-[man 1] Stevin Smith--
-[man 2] Stevin Smith--

1:03:42.777 --> 1:03:43.986
[woman] Stevin "Hedake" Smith--

1:03:44.070 --> 1:03:46.280
[man 3] …committed the cardinal sin
of college sports.

1:03:46.781 --> 1:03:48.658
[man 4] …the fixing of a basketball game.

1:03:49.408 --> 1:03:51.953
[Dwayne] I'm thinking,
"How could he do this?"

1:03:52.036 --> 1:03:53.663
"Why would he do this?"

1:03:53.746 --> 1:03:57.500
You know, we went to war together,
we were-- we were comrades.

1:03:57.583 --> 1:04:00.419
We were-- We grew up together.

1:04:01.712 --> 1:04:05.341
He let us down.
I'm sure he knows that he let us down.

1:04:07.093 --> 1:04:10.680
Stevin Smith agreed to fix
basketball games for Benny Silman

1:04:10.763 --> 1:04:12.932
and the other people named
in today's indictment.

1:04:20.481 --> 1:04:22.358
Everything finally caught up with us.

1:04:24.026 --> 1:04:26.445
And it was the--
as they say, the judgment day.

1:04:26.529 --> 1:04:28.364
It was time to pay the consequences.

1:04:30.783 --> 1:04:33.911
[Joe Lodge]
Isaac got three years probation,

1:04:35.079 --> 1:04:39.083
two-hundred hours of community service
and an $8,000 fine.

1:04:43.170 --> 1:04:46.591
I wish I didn't do it.
At the time, I didn't know though.

1:04:46.674 --> 1:04:50.469
I mean, if I had knew what was going on
and chose to do it, then yeah,

1:04:50.553 --> 1:04:52.847
I deserve all that,
but I didn't even know.

1:04:52.930 --> 1:04:56.100
I just wanted some money.
Just wanted some money.

1:05:00.563 --> 1:05:03.482
[Lodge] Joe Gagliano
got 15 months in prison,

1:05:03.566 --> 1:05:05.902
three years supervised release

1:05:06.402 --> 1:05:07.236
and a fine.

1:05:08.446 --> 1:05:09.363
[Joe] The judge…

1:05:10.615 --> 1:05:11.490
um…

1:05:11.991 --> 1:05:14.994
I remember him distinctly saying that…

1:05:15.703 --> 1:05:22.460
I destroyed the fabric
and the trust of college athletics.

1:05:26.047 --> 1:05:29.008
[Lodge] Hedake Smith
received a year and a day in prison…

1:05:29.091 --> 1:05:31.177
-[camera shutters clicking]
-…an $8,000 fine

1:05:31.260 --> 1:05:33.429
and 200 hours of community service.

1:05:39.518 --> 1:05:40.603
[Hedake] I fucked up.

1:05:42.355 --> 1:05:46.359
My dream ever since I started playing
was to make it big…

1:05:47.610 --> 1:05:49.320
and get the fuck outta the ghetto.

1:05:52.949 --> 1:05:55.201
But now, it was over.

1:06:05.461 --> 1:06:08.631
[Kent] The cost
of the point shaving scandal

1:06:08.714 --> 1:06:09.882
was tremendous…

1:06:10.591 --> 1:06:11.842
for Hedake Smith.

1:06:13.219 --> 1:06:17.223
You know, it probably affected his chances
of making it in the NBA.

1:06:18.599 --> 1:06:22.603
And he ended up
playing in the minor league.

1:06:24.647 --> 1:06:26.857
Isaac Burton bounced around overseas.

1:06:27.525 --> 1:06:29.235
Not a glamorous existence.

1:06:29.819 --> 1:06:33.197
ASU's reputation was severely damaged,

1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:34.907
and it cost Bill Frieder

1:06:34.991 --> 1:06:37.368
his college basketball coaching career.

1:06:41.247 --> 1:06:43.708
But, for me,
the biggest realization was…

1:06:44.250 --> 1:06:49.588
I realized how easy it is to shave points.

1:06:49.672 --> 1:06:56.554
To get to a-- to get to a kid
and to have him affect a basketball game.

1:06:57.263 --> 1:07:02.643
When you're an 18, 19, 20-year-old
college kid that's fighting and clawing

1:07:02.727 --> 1:07:05.521
and worrying about where
your next meal's gonna come from

1:07:05.604 --> 1:07:07.732
and you're gonna throw money
in front of 'em?

1:07:08.941 --> 1:07:10.776
It's very easy to get tempted.

1:07:15.406 --> 1:07:17.908
[Ice] That's why they need
to start paying the college kids.

1:07:18.826 --> 1:07:19.869
They have to.

1:07:20.661 --> 1:07:24.707
Because… gonna happen again.
It's gonna happen again.

1:07:26.250 --> 1:07:28.586
Always, you know,
preaching to the younger kids,

1:07:28.669 --> 1:07:33.174
younger generations about,
do the right thing, don't get caught up.

1:07:33.257 --> 1:07:36.969
You know,
don't betray the game that you love.

1:07:38.179 --> 1:07:39.472
Because if you do…

1:07:42.349 --> 1:07:45.061
it's something you'll have to live with
for the rest of your life.
