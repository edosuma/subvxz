00:00.434 --> 00:05.270
- (Setrakian):<i> Seven days.</i>
<i> Seven more days passed</i>

00:05.272 --> 00:08.540
<i> and the levee broke wide open.</i>

00:11.212 --> 00:14.013
<i> The government</i>
<i> exhausted its resources</i>

00:14.015 --> 00:16.382
<i> trying to contain</i>
<i> the infections</i>

00:16.384 --> 00:18.484
<i> in Washington,</i>

00:18.486 --> 00:20.953
<i> Atlanta, Dallas.</i>

00:20.955 --> 00:24.623
<i> But it spread</i>
<i> to 20 more cities,</i>

00:24.625 --> 00:28.127
<i> then 50.</i>

00:28.129 --> 00:30.529
<i> There was nowhere to run.</i>

00:33.200 --> 00:36.568
<i> Outbreaks were</i>
<i> reported in Germany,</i>

00:36.570 --> 00:40.039
<i> India, Africa,</i>

00:40.041 --> 00:42.741
<i> Japan.</i>

00:42.743 --> 00:45.744
<i> Countries tried their</i>
<i> own ways to stop it,</i>

00:45.746 --> 00:49.148
<i> but to no avail.</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:53.085
<i> One global environment</i>
<i> now engaged in a global war.</i>

00:57.158 --> 01:00.359
<i> Here in New York,</i>
<i> we held our battle lines</i>

01:00.361 --> 01:04.029
<i> against an enemy</i>
<i> that continued to evolve.</i>

01:04.031 --> 01:07.499
<i> But for how much longer?</i>

01:07.501 --> 01:09.701
<i> Were we still seeking victory</i>

01:09.703 --> 01:14.440
<i> or simply forestalling defeat?</i>

01:22.283 --> 01:25.884
- There's no need to take your
next turn. You've already lost.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.153
- Bullshit.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.091
- We can play out
the next six moves,

01:32.093 --> 01:35.060
or you can just knock over
your king right now.

01:35.062 --> 01:37.096
(rustling)

01:37.098 --> 01:39.898
Maintain some dignity.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.901
- Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

01:42.903 --> 01:46.071
(rustling)

01:46.073 --> 01:48.774
- Fine, it was bullshit.

01:48.776 --> 01:52.578
But this game is so boring!

01:52.580 --> 01:57.483
- Yeah, well, I think it's over,
anyway. Behind you.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.921
- Yeah, you've got
some of your own.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.858
(creatures growling)

02:09.430 --> 02:12.131
(snarling)

02:14.602 --> 02:17.603
- We're only keeping one, right?
- Yeah, the smallest one.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.339
(screeching)

02:20.341 --> 02:23.675
You can thank me later.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.815
(squealing)

02:35.456 --> 02:37.456
- Look at that.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.791
- Is that all the
bioweapon does now?

02:39.793 --> 02:42.661
I've seen worse with herpes.

02:42.663 --> 02:46.431
- From<i> strigoi</i> WMD to
"not as bad as herpes."

02:46.433 --> 02:48.500
Not a great week.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.441
(growling)

02:56.443 --> 03:00.212
- This will work.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.791
Welcome to the lab, love.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.793
- Thanks for donating
your body to science.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.029
(snarling)

03:31.845 --> 03:34.446
(distant yelling and gunshots)

03:40.688 --> 03:42.621
- Come on.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.260
You jealous? Huh?

03:51.198 --> 03:54.233
There's enough for both of you,
man. Later, my bitches.

03:54.235 --> 03:57.436
Hah! Wahoo!

04:12.052 --> 04:14.486
(distant sirens)

04:17.891 --> 04:20.626
(theme music)

05:15.082 --> 05:17.916
- I'm reading a chapter
on<i> strigoi</i> hunters.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.352
A long line of them,
dating all the way back

05:20.354 --> 05:23.021
to the ancient Sumerians.

05:23.023 --> 05:27.292
A Phoenician hunter set fire
to a ship full of people

05:27.294 --> 05:30.262
merely on the suspicion that
there was a<i> strigoi</i> on board.

05:30.264 --> 05:33.131
- How is any of this useful?

05:33.133 --> 05:35.767
- There's a commonality
among all these hunters:

05:35.769 --> 05:39.137
the desire to act alone.

05:39.139 --> 05:42.941
They appear monomaniacal

05:42.943 --> 05:46.878
and often seem
to be gripped by madness.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.316
Good thing none
of this applies to you.

05:51.318 --> 05:54.219
- Or you.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.894
(loud music)

06:08.402 --> 06:11.470
- ♪♪ I don't want you
to cook my bread ♪

06:11.472 --> 06:14.139
♪ I don't want you ♪

06:14.141 --> 06:16.308
♪ To make my bed ♪

06:16.310 --> 06:19.344
♪ I don't want your money too ♪

06:19.346 --> 06:23.448
♪ I just want

06:28.021 --> 06:31.189
♪ I don't want you

06:31.191 --> 06:35.694
♪ I don't want you

06:35.696 --> 06:39.498

06:39.500 --> 06:43.101
♪ I just want

06:55.215 --> 06:57.916
- It is rude
to just stand there.

06:57.918 --> 07:01.086
Mr. Pirk, is it?

07:01.088 --> 07:04.122
- Yes. Roald Pirk.
And you are Ms. Van Orden?

07:07.394 --> 07:10.061
- You may call me Saskia.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.030
I passed along
to my associate,

07:12.032 --> 07:16.134
Mr. Kruger, the papers of
provenance that you sent me,

07:16.136 --> 07:20.205
and his interest in the item
is greater than ever.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.274
- That is good news.

07:22.276 --> 07:26.578
Between us, Mr. Kruger
is not his real name, is it?

07:26.580 --> 07:28.880
- What makes you say that?

07:28.882 --> 07:30.882
- I did a little
digging on my own.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.285
In my line of work, I need to
make sure potential buyers have

07:33.287 --> 07:36.488
the means to close the deal.
- I assure you, Mr. Kruger

07:36.490 --> 07:39.658
has significant
resources at his disposal.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.260
- Yes, if he is the person
I suspect him to be,

07:42.262 --> 07:45.397
he is a viable buyer indeed.
I just need you to verify

07:45.399 --> 07:48.467
a few details. Is he a German?

07:48.469 --> 07:50.602
- Yes.
- And was he loyal

07:50.604 --> 07:52.938
to the Fatherland
during the war?

07:52.940 --> 07:54.973
- Yes, he was.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.809
- I heard a rumor

07:57.811 --> 08:01.580
he was employed at one of the
concentration camps in Poland.

08:01.582 --> 08:05.484
Doing good work there,
in my opinion.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.589
- I wouldn't know about that.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.858
- I see.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.293
Well, it would
please me to meet him.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.796
And, upon completing a deal,

08:17.798 --> 08:20.665
deliver the<i> Lumen</i> into his hand.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.802
- I will warn you,
there have been others

08:23.804 --> 08:26.972
who have attempted
to sell him forgeries.

08:26.974 --> 08:30.075
They did not come to happy ends.

08:32.980 --> 08:36.715
- This transaction will
be nothing but honorable.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.565
- (woman):<i> Difficult times</i>
<i> are also opportunities</i>

08:53.567 --> 08:56.501
<i> for people to come together.</i>
<i> You are not alone.</i>

08:56.503 --> 08:58.970
<i> At Stoneheart Freedom</i>
<i> Centers, we have food...</i>

08:58.972 --> 09:02.173
(elevator ding)
<i> ...clean water, and medicine.</i>

09:02.175 --> 09:04.676
<i> All you need</i>
<i> is your freedom card.</i>

09:04.678 --> 09:06.678
- Good morning, Eldritch.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.080
- Ah, Herr Eichorst.

09:14.021 --> 09:17.489
- Eldritch. Are you all right?

09:17.491 --> 09:19.791
(groaning)

09:22.162 --> 09:25.096
Nurse!
- Mr. Palmer? Mr. Palmer?

09:25.098 --> 09:27.699
Mr. Palmer?

09:27.701 --> 09:31.369
Can you hear me?
- (quietly): Yes.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.772
- A little help here, folks?

09:38.879 --> 09:40.879
- All right, come on.
- There we go.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.582
- There you go.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.420
- How many fingers
am I holding up?

09:48.422 --> 09:51.389
- I'm fine. I just stumbled.
- I'm going to get an IV.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.558
- I... No need for that...

09:53.560 --> 09:56.261
- We can come back another time
if you're not up for this.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.263
- Who are you?

09:58.265 --> 10:01.232
- Sanjay Desai.
- He's a new associate

10:01.234 --> 10:04.569
of ours, Eldritch.
Working to help us.

10:04.571 --> 10:07.539
A very impressive young man.

10:07.541 --> 10:09.541
- And I hear that
you are facilitating

10:09.543 --> 10:11.409
a very important
shipment for us.

10:11.411 --> 10:14.045
- And what business
is that of yours?

10:14.047 --> 10:17.215
- Oh, it's very much my business.
- Come again?

10:17.217 --> 10:19.918
- Don't upset
yourself, Eldritch.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.921
Now, what is the status
of the Aurora Cutlass?

10:22.923 --> 10:27.892
- The ship left port
in Egypt 31 days ago.

10:27.894 --> 10:32.297
- That's excellent.
Now we need you to make sure

10:32.299 --> 10:35.467
that it ports here in New York.
Given the chaos of the moment,

10:35.469 --> 10:37.335
it is a challenge
for any vessel

10:37.337 --> 10:40.105
to be permitted in the harbor. -
Can you make sure that it docks?

10:40.107 --> 10:42.941
- Pardon me?
- I'm sure Eldritch

10:42.943 --> 10:46.578
will accomplish this.
- What's on that ship

10:46.580 --> 10:49.581
that's so important?
- If you need to know,

10:49.583 --> 10:52.584
then I will tell you.
In the meantime,

10:52.586 --> 10:56.121
please alert us the moment
it reaches the docks.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.623
Thank you. It's been a pleasure.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.793
- What's been a pleasure?

11:01.795 --> 11:04.129
- This transaction.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.865
Have a good day.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.346
- Wow, you must
have gotten up early.

11:21.348 --> 11:25.650
- Never went to bed.
Here, look at this.

11:25.652 --> 11:28.553
We haven't been finding
anything particularly useful,

11:28.555 --> 11:30.655
looking for vulnerabilities
in the endocrine

11:30.657 --> 11:32.991
and circulatory system. And I
figured let's just start fresh.

11:32.993 --> 11:36.061
Let's strip everything
down to basics.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.800
- Oh!

11:41.802 --> 11:45.303
- This is it.
That's the parasite.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.639
This is the organism
that's infecting people.

11:47.641 --> 11:51.810
This is what we're fighting.
- So it's just a stinger,

11:51.812 --> 11:54.579
a spinal column, and a brain?
- No, not just any brain.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.848
The tissue
is necrotic.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.551
If you or I had a brain this
diseased, we'd barely be able

11:59.553 --> 12:01.753
to maintain a heartbeat,
let alone coordinate with others

12:01.755 --> 12:04.622
or stalk prey.
Now, look at this.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.529
- Worms. Not much better than
shit for brains, if you ask me.

12:11.531 --> 12:14.165
- Yeah. The worms aren't just
the vector for transmission.

12:14.167 --> 12:18.603
They seem to comprise the
core of their nervous system.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.475
- And I'm never eating
noodles again. Coffee?

12:26.179 --> 12:28.813
(beeping)

12:31.685 --> 12:35.120
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Turn off the microwave!

12:38.692 --> 12:41.426
Okay, turn it back on again.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.729
- Why?
(squeaking)

12:44.731 --> 12:46.965
- Come here.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.604
What do you think it is
that they're reacting to?

12:52.606 --> 12:54.572
Do you think
microwaves are escaping?

12:54.574 --> 12:57.242
- Not if you trust government
safety regulations.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.078
- So microwaves
are definitely escaping.

13:00.080 --> 13:04.682
And the worms are
somehow responding to it.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.821
It's like they've woken up.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.165
(siren)

13:20.167 --> 13:23.434
- (Justine): This was supposed
to be secure, Frank.

13:23.436 --> 13:27.071
Those people moved here because
we told them it was a safe zone.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.907
- It could have been a lot
worse. Our response teams--

13:28.909 --> 13:31.743
- I don't need you spinning
this. Just tell me how the hell

13:31.745 --> 13:34.245
they're getting in here.
- They must be coming

13:34.247 --> 13:36.414
from underground, somehow.
- You said we cleared

13:36.416 --> 13:38.650
all the tunnels.
- We did.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.785
- Well, however it's magically
happening, they've got us

13:40.787 --> 13:44.122
chasing our tails. These guys
should've been out last night

13:44.124 --> 13:47.358
taking back the rest
of Manhattan, not stuck here

13:47.360 --> 13:49.761
on clean-up duty, I mean--
- I know--

13:49.763 --> 13:52.497
- This is not how we win, Frank!
We're moving backwards.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.666
- I'm trying.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.768
- Not hard enough.

13:56.770 --> 13:59.838
Let's go, guys.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.145
(glass breaking)

14:07.147 --> 14:09.147
(fire alarm)

14:09.149 --> 14:12.083
(beeping)

14:15.989 --> 14:18.389
- Great! A hipster<i> strigoi...</i>

14:31.538 --> 14:33.605
(crackling)

14:45.685 --> 14:48.019
- It's been a week.
Did you get

14:48.021 --> 14:50.555
the powder working again?
- No, but look at this.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.925
- Hi, I'm Dutch Velders.

14:53.927 --> 14:56.895
I fought with you, right here
in Red Hook, actually.

14:56.897 --> 15:00.865
- Here, look at this.
(coughing)

15:00.867 --> 15:02.901
We believe this is
the communication center

15:02.903 --> 15:05.904
of the<i> strigoi</i> brain.
- And watch this!

15:05.906 --> 15:08.539
When I cause pain
to<i> Strigoi</i> A...

15:08.541 --> 15:12.010
(creature snarling)
- I get a pronounced response

15:12.012 --> 15:14.579
in<i> Strigoi</i> B. This proves
that they're communicating

15:14.581 --> 15:17.348
by way of some
highly evolved signals.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.384
This is a biological system.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.185
The way a migratory bird

15:21.187 --> 15:25.356
can fly 3,000 miles to some
specific winter nesting spot

15:25.358 --> 15:27.225
in Mexico.
Complex? Mysterious?

15:27.227 --> 15:29.894
Yes, but empirically
solvable.

15:29.896 --> 15:32.864
- But you haven't solved it.

15:32.866 --> 15:34.933
I need a new weapon.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.235
We are running out of time.

15:37.237 --> 15:40.271
- You saw them last week?
You saw how they were different,

15:40.273 --> 15:43.408
less directed.
Shut down their communication,

15:43.410 --> 15:45.743
we can get them back
into that condition.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.812
- Let's go.
- If we can pull this off,

15:47.814 --> 15:49.781
we can have a devastating
effect on them.

15:49.783 --> 15:53.685
- Not "if." When we're going to.

35:55.921 --> 35:58.221
Aww, look at the poor lummox.

36:01.260 --> 36:04.327
- A rapidly plummeting IQ --
it's adorable.

36:07.432 --> 36:11.635
The microwave-gun challenge test
is a success,

36:11.637 --> 36:14.037
strongly showing

36:14.039 --> 36:15.539

36:17.809 --> 36:20.143
You're still shooting it, right?
- Yeah!

36:20.145 --> 36:23.847
Let me make some adjustments.

So, they have
found some way

36:52.010 --> 36:54.211
of getting around
the interference.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.883
The Master's system is
more complex than we thought.

You don't have to be
so blue about it.

37:08.026 --> 37:10.193
It's totally "figure-outable."

37:10.195 --> 37:12.762

37:15.033 --> 37:17.033

37:19.438 --> 37:21.471

37:25.077 --> 37:26.876

37:26.878 --> 37:31.548
we just have
to make things go well then.

37:31.550 --> 37:34.184
- Oh, is that all
we have to do?

37:51.436 --> 37:54.938
the Egyptians trapped an Ancient
inside this sarcophagus?

37:54.940 --> 37:57.741
- Yes. And he's probably
still there.

37:57.743 --> 38:01.745
I should have thought
of this before,

38:01.747 --> 38:03.747
as I did something
similar once.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.749
Not to an Ancient,

38:05.751 --> 38:08.318
but to a sentient<i> strigoi.</i>

38:08.320 --> 38:10.987
He'd always been

38:46.325 --> 38:48.391
(muffled,
high-pitched screaming)

39:06.812 --> 39:09.145
I spent decades

39:09.147 --> 39:13.049
trying to cast the memory
from my mind.

39:13.051 --> 39:15.485
It's the closest to madness
I've ever come.

39:15.487 --> 39:18.054

ringing and honking outside)

39:25.197 --> 39:28.698
- Good things can be born out of
madness, Professor. Don't you see?

39:28.700 --> 39:31.368
Imprisonment is the key
to defeating the Master.

39:31.370 --> 39:34.037
Not combat
or physical destruction.

39:34.039 --> 39:37.741
- As long as
the crimson worm survives,

39:37.743 --> 39:41.211
the Master can
always transfer bodies.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.346
- Yes, but if he is contained
within the silver,

39:43.348 --> 39:45.348
and his communicative power

39:45.350 --> 39:47.650
suppressed by the lead
inside the box,

39:47.652 --> 39:50.186
then he's truly powerless.

39:50.188 --> 39:53.523
- No wonder he's hiding.

39:53.525 --> 39:55.892
- Yes. Therein lies
the challenge.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.361
We now know how to defeat
the Master,

39:58.363 --> 40:00.864
but we don't know
where he is.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.533
Or even who he is.

40:03.535 --> 40:05.869
- There is one person

40:05.871 --> 40:07.971
who could find out.

the formula

40:31.763 --> 40:35.465
for the white,
but I will give you a dose.

40:37.369 --> 40:40.103
- How long will a dose last?

40:40.105 --> 40:41.571
- Long enough.

40:41.573 --> 40:44.240
In exchange,
you will find out

40:44.242 --> 40:46.609
whose body the Master has taken.

40:48.547 --> 40:51.314
- He is no longer
in Bolivar's body?

40:53.718 --> 40:56.052
- So he has
lost faith in you.

40:56.054 --> 40:58.588
Should I question your ability
to do this?

40:58.590 --> 41:00.457
- No-no, I can do it.

41:00.459 --> 41:03.460
He still needs me.
Of that, I am certain.

41:05.263 --> 41:09.899
Otherwise, I would
already be dead.

41:09.901 --> 41:12.135
