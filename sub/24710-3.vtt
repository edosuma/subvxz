-Glad you came.

I, uh, I remembered
you liked this yogurt.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.500
Oh, thanks.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.546
-How's Bobby?
-The doctor's looking at him now.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.841
The nurses said he seemed
to spend a fairly comfortable night.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.259
-Good.
-DIANE: Yeah.

-Okay, you can lie back now.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.187
It sound better?

01:02.771 --> 01:04.439
I'd hoped it'd sound better
than it does.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.317
Now, you say you are breathing
more comfortably?

01:08.193 --> 01:09.486
Yeah, I think I might be.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.614
I know you want to keep
a positive outlook, Bobby.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.367
But I need to know how you're feeling.
Now being candid,

01:16.451 --> 01:18.661
would you say your breathing
might actually be a little worse?

01:20.205 --> 01:21.998

-Sure.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.304
Does Bobby's chest sound better?

01:36.679 --> 01:39.474
Frankly, I'd hoped he'd be doing better
than what I'm hearing this morning.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.852
I'd like to repeat the echo study,
we did on your husband yesterday.

You know, you two are idiots.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.340
What does that mean, Andy?

05:40.465 --> 05:42.633
That means Simone's gonna have
an emergency test.

is keeping Diane company?

instead of worrying about him.

-You guys wanna hear about this?
-Yeah, but first we wanted you

06:01.611 --> 06:04.739
to walk away from your crime scene
and come over here, squeezing shoes.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.199
What do you got?

06:06.324 --> 06:09.243

No weapon that we could find.

Oh, that's all crucially
timely information.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.291
I can see why that would
be such a temptation

06:15.375 --> 06:17.668
for you to come over here
and interrupt our conversation.

to the guy in the blue jacket.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.680

that we want to talk to him, all right?

let him wander over here.

GREG: Maybe he was takin'
a leak in the bushes.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.856
Yeah, that would be the sole purpose

06:38.940 --> 06:41.442
anybody'd take their pants
down in the park, Medavoy.

06:41.692 --> 06:44.737
Got defensive cuts on his hands.
No wallet.

He must have got lured out here.

When you're wearin' a 100 dollar shirt,
you take your leaks in a bar.

of invoice we got here.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.423

on Canal street.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.432

Yeah, it looks like it's off
of one of them blue blazers.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.812
Well, it wouldn't be
off the D.O.A.'s jacket.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.022

who wore a blue blazer.

-A dead guy. You know anything about it?

Nah, I'm not, I'm just wondering
what the guy looks like.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.961
-Is he a dark guy?
-Yeah. How'd you know?

07:42.295 --> 07:43.921
I think maybe I know
who brought him in here.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.091

walkin' into the park about midnight.

-What's this about?

08:58.996 --> 09:02.750
Where were you last night?
Did you go into Tompkins Square Park?

09:02.959 --> 09:05.294
No. I wasn't anywhere around there.

and lie to us?

09:08.214 --> 09:09.840

09:10.132 --> 09:12.051
ANDY: We got absolutely
reliable information

09:12.134 --> 09:15.805
you went in the park around midnight
with a guy that turned up dead.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.350
You're gonna be charged with murder.
And this is a death penalty case.

09:19.767 --> 09:23.312
So you can say good-bye
to your scummy crackhead life, Trish,

09:23.437 --> 09:25.982
and your good standing in that hotel!

09:26.232 --> 09:27.858
You gonna let him intimidate me like this?

you gotta tell us the truth.

what your reliable information is,

with that guy, period.

-You're tellin' me that guy's not dead?
-I'm saying I didn't do it.

She's a Spanish girl.

when she picked up this foreign guy.

We worked it out that while

10:02.602 --> 10:05.730

and she started screaming.

17:21.749 --> 17:22.750
Hi again.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.461
The arteries to Bobby's heart are clear.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.921
That puts the trouble in the heart itself.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.631
And I went ahead and took
the small tissue samples,

17:29.757 --> 17:31.383
that we talked about for lab analysis.

17:31.675 --> 17:34.011
-This is the biopsy?
-It's called a biopsy, right.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.473
Now, I need to tell you
that in some sense,

17:37.639 --> 17:38.849
the biopsy results are secondary.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.560
Because whatever's going on has damaged
Bobby's heart badly enough,

17:42.019 --> 17:44.980
-that I think we're looking at surgery.
-DIANE: Like a bypass?

17:45.230 --> 17:47.357
This machine inflates
and deflates the balloon,

17:47.483 --> 17:49.276
I put in Bobby's aorta
to help his heart pump.

17:49.818 --> 17:52.988
-DIANE: You already did the surgery?
-No. I threaded the balloon

17:53.113 --> 17:54.823
through the same catheter incision
in Bobby's thigh.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.701
And that's a temporary measure
to help his heart pump,

17:57.785 --> 18:00.579
-and so he can breathe more easily.
-But then, he'll still need an operation.

18:00.871 --> 18:01.872
I think he is.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.457
And then he won't need
the machine anymore.

18:03.582 --> 18:04.708
Right, then he won't need the machine.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.585
Now, I explained to Bobby,

18:06.919 --> 18:09.171
why I put the balloon in
and started him on the pump.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.006
But I don't know
how much he'll remember.

18:11.298 --> 18:14.093
I had to give him a pretty good dose
of morphine during the biopsy.

A bypass isn't an option.

Bobby's arteries are clear.
It's his heart itself that's been damaged.

19:44.391 --> 19:47.102
If his condition improves
over the next few days,

19:47.644 --> 19:51.315
we may implant what's called
a left ventricular assist device.

-Including your coat and his blood on it?
-Yeah, well, who says that's my coat?

better be careful,

32:28.696 --> 32:30.907
he don't come back upstairs,
attached to no pump.

and no one tells him what's goin' on.

to explain it to you.

Well, he could start with explaining
this tube coming out of my joint.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.631
No one's said nothin' about that.

32:47.006 --> 32:48.549
It's just to help you urinate.

Is it uncomfortable?

32:55.390 --> 32:58.351
Don't even give me no highlights, huh?
Those were his instructions?

33:07.026 --> 33:08.611
He said your heart's damaged.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.531
And, if you get stabilized,

33:12.031 --> 33:14.742
they'll put in some other kind
of mechanical pump.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.496
And then he thinks
you'll need a transplant.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.253
Okay.

33:25.378 --> 33:27.964
But he said the operation
has a high success rate.

33:28.256 --> 33:32.218
-Yeah, huh?
-Ninety percent go back to normal lives.

let him tell you, Bobby.

all these positive statistics.

circumstances, too.

sitting, crying in the grape arbor
outside Papa's house.

39:12.892 --> 39:15.770
He only spent the last day
holding his hand.

39:18.898 --> 39:24.195
And... this... this may not be hopeless.
This with Bobby.

39:24.653 --> 39:26.781
And this may not be hopeless.

39:27.031 --> 39:30.284
This could be successful.
This whole transplant procedure.

39:32.411 --> 39:34.288
Assuming they can find a heart.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.083
Do you want to pray, Andy?

39:43.672 --> 39:44.715
Go ahead.

39:46.634 --> 39:51.389
-Probably you got a better chance.
-(CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES)

40:04.985 --> 40:06.028
BOBBY: Hey.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.115
Look who's there.

40:12.034 --> 40:13.119
BOBBY: How's it goin'?

40:13.828 --> 40:17.248
I'm workin' with mopes and half-brains.
How do you expect? (SCOFFS)

40:17.373 --> 40:19.708
(CLEARS THROAT) How long you gonna
be on nights?

40:20.042 --> 40:22.420
Huh. You tell me.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.883
'Cause, you know, Medavoy and Martinez,
that's not my cup of tea.

40:28.634 --> 40:31.971
-Jill was with Diane.
-ANDY: Yeah, she wasn't in.

40:33.806 --> 40:37.059
-How you feel?
-I never got over this chest bug.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.436
So far.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.481
-No, right.
-To this point, you mean.

40:43.566 --> 40:46.193
Oh, hey, I'm not
throwin' any towels in.

40:46.986 --> 40:50.739
What is it? The 90 percent so forth...
90 percent are up and around?

40:51.407 --> 40:53.451
Yeah, positive statistics for the morning.

40:53.701 --> 40:54.785
ANDY: I'll tell you this.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.413
(SIGHS) When you're ready to come back,
I'm ready to work with you.

40:57.830 --> 41:00.833
I'm dealin' with mopes and half-brains.
My entire work environment.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.252
Okay, Andy.

41:06.255 --> 41:07.298
Okay.

41:08.424 --> 41:12.344
You got a lot of positive statistics,
and as much as she loves you...

41:16.056 --> 41:17.266
Okay, partner.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.518
Okay.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.107
