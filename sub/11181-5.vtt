WEBVTT

00:05.281 --> 00:07.835
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:07.973 --> 00:10.838
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:10.976 --> 00:15.636
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:15.774 --> 00:18.535
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:18.673 --> 00:21.538
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:21.676 --> 00:25.611
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:27.268 --> 00:29.753
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:29.891 --> 00:32.377
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:32.515 --> 00:34.931
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:35.069 --> 00:37.830
Just to get up that hill

00:37.968 --> 00:40.281
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:40.419 --> 00:42.870
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:43.008 --> 00:45.424
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:45.562 --> 00:47.116
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:47.254 --> 00:49.911
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:50.050 --> 00:53.053
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:53.191 --> 00:57.540
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:57.678 --> 01:00.267
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

01:00.405 --> 01:03.580
To the East Side
Movin' on up

01:03.718 --> 01:10.208
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:13.590 --> 01:14.764
Mmm, mmm, mmm...

01:15.972 --> 01:18.492
What's happening
in the stock market
this morning, George?

01:18.630 --> 01:20.770
I don't know. I ain't
reading the stock market.

01:20.908 --> 01:22.082
Then what's so interesting?

01:22.220 --> 01:23.290
The obituary.

01:24.981 --> 01:27.259
Oh, well, that's like
the stock market.

01:27.397 --> 01:29.848
Lots of people going under.

01:34.749 --> 01:36.613
That ain't funny, Weez.

01:36.751 --> 01:38.753
Here's a man worth
60 million bucks,

01:38.891 --> 01:40.790
and he kicks off,
what's he got
to show for it?

01:40.928 --> 01:44.034
A couple of words
on the goodbye page.

01:44.173 --> 01:46.554
The good Lord don't care
about a person's bank book.

01:46.692 --> 01:49.937
On Judgment Day,
we'll all stand naked
before Him.

01:50.075 --> 01:51.387
Then do me
a favor, Florence.

01:51.525 --> 01:52.905
Please don't stand
in my line.

01:56.944 --> 01:58.946
Of course, you won't
need no clothes.

01:59.084 --> 02:01.155
All you need
where you're going
is an air conditioner.

02:04.676 --> 02:07.230
What's this sudden
fascination with death?

02:08.852 --> 02:10.647
I'm thinking
about life, Weezy.

02:10.785 --> 02:12.408
I mean, I'm 48 years old,
and what am I?

02:12.822 --> 02:13.857
Hmm.

02:13.995 --> 02:14.962
Late for work.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.482
Oh, and what am I
gonna do at work?

02:17.620 --> 02:21.727
Same old thing.
Clean some pants,
pressing some dresses.

02:21.865 --> 02:23.902
Is this what life
adds up for for me?

02:24.040 --> 02:25.628
Just a bunch of money?

02:25.766 --> 02:27.319
I'm gonna take
your temperature.

02:29.079 --> 02:31.047
I ain't sick, Weezy.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.946
Look, do you have
any idea what's going on
inside of my head?

02:34.084 --> 02:36.984
No. And I don't think
they have a cure
for it, either.

02:37.122 --> 02:39.124
All right,
you keep making fun.

02:39.262 --> 02:42.507
But one of these days,
our names are gonna be
in that obituary page.

02:42.645 --> 02:44.750
In that case, maybe you
ought to start paying me
in advance.

02:49.548 --> 02:51.585
Florence, you're
a real treasure.

02:51.723 --> 02:53.621
Thank you.
Too bad they dug you up.

02:59.075 --> 03:01.008
Oh, good morning, Florence.
Hello, everyone.

03:01.146 --> 03:02.630
Isn't it
a lovely day today?

03:02.768 --> 03:04.218
Where?
Everywhere.

03:04.356 --> 03:06.565
The sun is shining,
the flowers are blooming.

03:06.703 --> 03:08.049
The birds
are in the trees.

03:10.638 --> 03:12.813
Not all of them.
One cuckoo got loose.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.542
Well, it's a perfect day
for a brisk walk
in the park,

03:17.680 --> 03:19.682
and I was wondering
if any of you would care
to join me.

03:19.820 --> 03:21.684
I'll go.
Oh, Florence,

03:21.822 --> 03:23.479
you haven't
finished your work.

03:23.617 --> 03:25.515
Mrs. Jefferson, if you
had a choice between work

03:25.653 --> 03:27.897
and taking
a walk in the park,
what would you do?

03:28.035 --> 03:29.588
I'd stay and
finish the work.

03:29.726 --> 03:31.659
Thank you.
While you're doing that,
I'll be in the park.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.698
Hey, wait a minute.

03:35.836 --> 03:37.665
I don't pay you
to take walks.

03:37.803 --> 03:39.357
Yeah, well, you sure
don't pay me enough
to take the bus.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.639
Why so grouchy today,
Mr. J?

03:45.777 --> 03:48.435
Oh, George is just
a little down.

03:48.573 --> 03:51.334
Well, in that case,
the fresh air would
do him a world of good.

03:51.472 --> 03:54.786
Remember, Mr. J,
you've got to stop
and smell the roses.

03:54.924 --> 03:56.788
Uh, George was
thinking more about

03:56.926 --> 03:58.376
pushing up the daisies.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.311
What's the trouble?
Is there something
I can do?

04:02.449 --> 04:04.865
Yeah. You can turn
the clock back 20 years.

04:05.003 --> 04:07.626
My goodness, is it
Daylight Savings Time
again already?

04:08.972 --> 04:10.180
Nobody understands.

04:10.319 --> 04:11.872
Oh, come on, George.

04:12.010 --> 04:14.771
You have a lovely home,
a successful business...

04:14.909 --> 04:17.567
Big deal! What are they
gonna say about me
in the history books?

04:17.705 --> 04:19.259
Did I cure disease? Nope.

04:19.397 --> 04:21.157
Did I walk on the moon?
Nope.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.263
I'm just plain old
George Jefferson,

04:23.401 --> 04:26.231
cleaning and pressing.
Alterations extra.

04:28.958 --> 04:30.304
But, George...

04:30.442 --> 04:33.376
When a man's gone,
what's the world got
to remember him by?

04:33.514 --> 04:35.240
Well, it depends on the man.

04:35.378 --> 04:38.312
My family will always
remember Uncle Potter
for what he left us.

04:38.450 --> 04:39.693
Oh, yeah?
What did he leave you?

04:39.831 --> 04:41.073
An enormous medical bill.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.802
Yeah, but I wanna leave
something that they'll
never forget me.

04:45.940 --> 04:48.288
Oh, I see. A legacy
for posterity, eh?

04:48.426 --> 04:50.773
No, no! Something that's
gonna last forever!

04:53.569 --> 04:56.261
Well, the great men
of history have
been immortalized

04:56.399 --> 04:57.987
in various ways.
Like what?

04:58.125 --> 05:00.507
Oh, statues,
paintings, busts.

05:01.024 --> 05:02.267
Busts?

05:02.405 --> 05:04.304
Yes. There are lots of
people who had busts made.

05:04.442 --> 05:07.168
Julius Caesar, Napoleon,
Abraham Lincoln...

05:07.307 --> 05:09.688
Hey, that's not a bad idea.

05:09.826 --> 05:11.897
In fact, it's a great idea.
A bust.

05:12.588 --> 05:14.762
George, don't be ridiculous.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.833
Yes, I saw a bust
of Caesar the other day

05:16.971 --> 05:19.008
that captured the
very essence of power.

05:19.146 --> 05:21.010
Yeah. Boy, those guys know,

05:21.148 --> 05:23.357
they sure knew
how to be remembered.
Hmm.

05:23.495 --> 05:25.290
But, George, those guys

05:25.428 --> 05:27.534
were famous when
they were alive.

05:27.672 --> 05:30.364
So what?
It was a lot easier
to be famous in those days.

05:30.502 --> 05:32.159
There was still plenty
of fame to go around.

05:34.195 --> 05:36.991
You know, I think
he's got something there.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.408
Yeah. Too bad
it isn't a brain.

05:40.788 --> 05:43.998
Bentley, I'm glad
you stopped by.
You really cheered me up.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.517
I think I'm ready
for that walk now.

05:45.655 --> 05:48.382
Oh, splendid, Mr. J.
Delighted to have you along.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.522
You know, a vigorous walk
does wonders for the soul.

05:50.660 --> 05:52.075
Right.

05:56.494 --> 05:58.081
A bust.

05:58.219 --> 05:59.807
Now why didn't
I think of that?

05:59.945 --> 06:02.189
Hey, Weezy, tell me,
where can I find one
of them bust makers?

06:02.327 --> 06:04.018
Just look in
the Yellow Pages.
Right.

06:04.847 --> 06:06.158
Under "Dumb ideas".

06:07.263 --> 06:08.575
What's so dumb about it?

06:08.713 --> 06:11.198
It's just a big waste
of time and money.

06:11.336 --> 06:13.062
Well, it's my time
and my money!

06:13.200 --> 06:14.719
If I ain't gonna
waste it, who will?

06:15.547 --> 06:16.859
Uh, George,

06:16.997 --> 06:18.757
if you wanna
be remembered,

06:18.895 --> 06:21.139
why don't you do something
useful with your money?

06:21.277 --> 06:23.866
Help build a library,
or a hospital...

06:24.004 --> 06:26.316
There's only one thing
wrong with that, Weezy.
What?

06:26.455 --> 06:29.009
None of them things
look like me.

06:34.463 --> 06:35.567
Coming.

06:39.744 --> 06:42.298
What is it?
Uh... Uh, are you
Vincent Carter?

06:42.436 --> 06:44.334
Yes. What can I do
for you, Mr...

06:44.473 --> 06:46.440
Jefferson.
George Jefferson.

06:46.578 --> 06:48.649
I got your name from
an art gallery down
in the Village.

06:49.650 --> 06:50.962
I copied it off
one of the busts.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.622
Hey, you really are good.

06:55.760 --> 06:56.830
Thank you.

06:57.727 --> 06:59.142
I can't see
the numbers at all.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.909
You say the gallery
sent you?
Yeah.

07:07.047 --> 07:08.635
I must have a chat
with them.

07:08.773 --> 07:12.121
Good. Yep, I think
I found the right man.

07:14.157 --> 07:15.504
Oh, hey, what you
got over here?

07:15.642 --> 07:18.507
I get the feeling this one
isn't for you, Mr. Jefferson.

07:18.645 --> 07:21.579
It's a nude.
Oh, it sure is.

07:21.717 --> 07:24.478
I am particularly proud
of the way I did the hands.

07:24.616 --> 07:26.273
Oh, yeah,
they're nice, too.

07:31.105 --> 07:33.453
You caught me
at a very busy time,
Mr. Jefferson.

07:33.591 --> 07:36.525
Was there something
specific you wanted?

07:36.663 --> 07:39.873
Yeah. I'm here to buy
the greatest bust
you ever sculpted.

07:40.011 --> 07:42.323
Which was that?
The one with
my face on it.

07:43.877 --> 07:45.913
A personal portrait?

07:46.051 --> 07:47.501
I never do
personal portraits.

07:47.639 --> 07:48.882
You'll have to find
someone else.

07:49.538 --> 07:50.711
But I want you.

07:50.849 --> 07:52.092
Your work looks real.

07:52.230 --> 07:54.025
Everything else I've seen
looks like lumpy rocks.

07:55.336 --> 07:57.960
I'm sorry, Mr. Jefferson.
I wouldn't be interested.

07:58.098 --> 08:01.342
Quite frankly, your face
doesn't excite me.

08:04.207 --> 08:06.969
I don't wanna get engaged,
I just want a bust.

08:09.627 --> 08:12.906
Sir, try to understand.
I am an artist.

08:13.044 --> 08:14.390
Well, ain't you
a businessman, too?

08:14.528 --> 08:15.598
Certainly not.

08:15.736 --> 08:17.497
A project has to move me.

08:17.635 --> 08:19.878
Art comes from the soul.

08:20.016 --> 08:22.467
I only do
what I want to do.

08:22.605 --> 08:25.021
Oh, suppose
I give you $1,000?

08:25.159 --> 08:26.367
Then I want to do you.

08:27.817 --> 08:30.613
Got you
right in the soul,
didn't it, Carter?

08:30.751 --> 08:32.546
But don't worry,
it'll be a pleasure

08:32.684 --> 08:33.858
considering what you got
to work with.

08:34.928 --> 08:36.516
What did you
have in mind?

08:36.654 --> 08:38.379
Oh, I don't know.
You got a book of busts?

08:39.691 --> 08:42.314
A what?
A book of busts!

08:42.452 --> 08:44.178
So I can show you how
I want it to look.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.525
Mr. Jefferson,
in the first place,

08:45.663 --> 08:49.080
we do not call
an art catalog
a "book of busts".

08:49.218 --> 08:51.185
And in the second place,
I am the artist.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.394
I must insist on
doing it my way.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.535
Hmm...
Did I say $1,000?

08:55.673 --> 08:56.915
I meant $1,500.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.711
Your way is my way.

09:00.919 --> 09:02.369
Have a seat.

09:02.507 --> 09:05.475
I'll go find
a book of busts.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.933
How is that, Ralph?
Light hitting me
right in the middle?

09:15.071 --> 09:16.452
Yes, sir,
Mr. Jefferson.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.316
Good. 'Cause I want
everything to be perfect.

09:18.454 --> 09:21.008
Look, and don't show
nobody this bust until
the time comes.

09:21.146 --> 09:22.458
You can count
on me, sir.

09:23.114 --> 09:24.460
Here's your drink.

09:24.598 --> 09:25.634
Thanks, Florence.

09:26.082 --> 09:27.290
Hmm...

09:27.428 --> 09:29.258
What you,
"hmm-ing" about?

09:29.396 --> 09:30.777
Making me
wear my uniform.

09:30.915 --> 09:33.089
It's supposed to be just
for special occasions.

09:33.227 --> 09:35.713
Well, this is
a special occasion for me.

09:35.851 --> 09:37.059
Then why don't
you wear it?

09:40.269 --> 09:41.650
'Cause it ain't my size.

09:44.445 --> 09:47.517
No, Florence, look,
I thought I asked you for
Scotch. This is Bourbon.

09:47.656 --> 09:49.105
It is? Let me see...

09:52.488 --> 09:53.869
You're right. It's Bourbon.

09:54.766 --> 09:56.250
Never mind!
I'll get it myself!

09:57.631 --> 09:59.115
Hi.
We're here.

09:59.253 --> 10:02.705
Hey, welcome, welcome.

10:02.843 --> 10:05.777
You're just in time
for the big moment.

10:05.915 --> 10:09.229
This is what I love.
To see my whole family
together again.

10:11.541 --> 10:12.888
Yes, yes...

10:13.026 --> 10:14.130
Oh, my goodness, Tom.

10:14.268 --> 10:15.649
Check quick to see
if he picked your pocket.

10:18.859 --> 10:21.931
Oh, Helen, George can be
nice, you know.

10:22.069 --> 10:24.485
Yes, but I've never seen
him carry it this far.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.901
We've been here
30 seconds,

10:26.039 --> 10:27.557
and he hasn't
called me honkey yet.

10:29.180 --> 10:30.526
It's gotta be the bust.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.839
He's been
so much sweeter lately.

10:32.977 --> 10:35.842
He's been
more romantic, too.
If you know what I mean.

10:36.843 --> 10:38.361
Really?

10:38.499 --> 10:40.778
Tom, maybe you should
get a bust made.

10:44.367 --> 10:45.541
Hey, kids,

10:45.679 --> 10:47.439
I'm glad to see you two
could make it.

10:47.577 --> 10:48.786
All ready
for my unveiling?

10:48.924 --> 10:51.271
Wouldn't miss it
for anything, Pop.

10:51.409 --> 10:53.273
Mr. Jefferson, you won't mind
if we take a little peek,
would you?

10:53.411 --> 10:56.069
Oh, I wouldn't
recommend it, Jenny.

10:56.207 --> 10:57.760
My security guard
is a trained killer.

11:02.869 --> 11:04.353
Hello, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.

11:04.491 --> 11:05.768
Bentley!

11:07.114 --> 11:08.495
Oh, come in, Mr. Bentley.

11:08.633 --> 11:10.290
The party's just starting.

11:10.428 --> 11:11.567
Weezy, ain't you
got no culture?

11:11.705 --> 11:13.914
This ain't no party.
It's an opening.

11:14.052 --> 11:16.434
Oh, you mean, like
the hole in your head?

11:17.953 --> 11:19.437
Oh, the suspense
is killing me.

11:19.575 --> 11:21.301
I... I can hardly wait
to see the bust.

11:21.439 --> 11:22.682
Me, too.

11:22.820 --> 11:24.269
You mean, you haven't
seen it either?

11:24.407 --> 11:26.582
For three weeks
I've hardly seen George.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.274
He's been running to his
sittings almost every night.

11:29.412 --> 11:31.000
Well, everybody,

11:31.138 --> 11:32.519
I guess it's about
that time, huh?

11:34.107 --> 11:36.557
Okay, Ralph,
I'll take it from here.
Yes, sir.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.904
Okay, everybody,
gather around,

11:38.042 --> 11:39.146
make sure
you get a good view.

11:39.284 --> 11:40.872
Go ahead, Lionel.
No, you...

11:43.116 --> 11:46.326
Okay, now I ain't
gonna make a big speech,

11:47.085 --> 11:48.362
but I gotta say something...

11:52.263 --> 11:53.643
Tonight...

11:56.025 --> 11:59.822
Tonight is one of the
biggest nights in my life.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.653
Tonight is the night
George Jefferson
goes immortal.

12:03.792 --> 12:05.621
LIONEL: All right...
Yeah...

12:08.797 --> 12:11.903
A man has to leave
something to the world
to remember him by.

12:12.835 --> 12:14.803
So, I am leaving
you something

12:14.941 --> 12:16.632
for all of my family
and friends.

12:17.875 --> 12:21.602
And here it is,
my gift to all of you...

13:09.167 --> 13:11.480
All right, hold it,
hold it! Hold it, shut up!

13:11.618 --> 13:14.483
Now you can keep quiet,
what is wrong with y'all?
Are you crazy?

13:16.002 --> 13:17.520
Stop that cackling!

13:17.658 --> 13:20.040
Well, I ain't the only
one who laughed.

13:20.178 --> 13:22.387
What about you, Weezy?
You think
it's a big joke, too?

13:22.525 --> 13:24.320
Oh, no, George,
not at all.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.460
It... It just
surprised me.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.290
Actually, I think it's...

13:33.951 --> 13:37.023
It's not...
It just wasn't
what I expected.

13:38.058 --> 13:40.543
What Louise means,
George, is that...

13:40.681 --> 13:41.890
Well, it has
a certain...

13:50.415 --> 13:51.658
Excuse me, sir.

13:51.796 --> 13:53.902
I seem to have got a little
tickle in my throat.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.526
Uh, I think
it's kind of cute.

14:00.011 --> 14:01.599
Well, what are you
laughing at, Bentley?

14:01.737 --> 14:03.843
It was your idea for me
to get the bust made
in the first place.

14:03.981 --> 14:05.879
No disrespect intended,
Mr. J.

14:06.017 --> 14:07.847
It was just
a nervous reaction.

14:07.985 --> 14:09.607
What were you
nervous about?

14:09.745 --> 14:11.126
That I might
start laughing.

14:14.577 --> 14:18.581
George, I think
it's the wreath and toga.

14:20.998 --> 14:24.173
No one's worn those things
for 2,000 years.

14:24.311 --> 14:26.313
So what? You know
how styles change.

14:26.451 --> 14:28.108
If you wait long enough,
they all come back.

14:29.454 --> 14:30.766
Now you tell me,

14:30.904 --> 14:33.320
just when I gave my last
toga to the Salvation Army.

14:34.804 --> 14:36.013
Will you shut up, Willis!

14:36.151 --> 14:38.360
When I want your opinion
I'll dial "honkey".

14:39.706 --> 14:41.156
Ah, there's that word.

14:41.294 --> 14:42.916
I knew it couldn't last.

14:43.054 --> 14:45.919
You know, the...
The artist does have
a distinctive style.

14:46.057 --> 14:47.645
Actually, it doesn't
look half bad.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.028
The half that's bad
is in the front...

14:54.272 --> 14:56.240
Oh, I'm sorry, George.
I couldn't resist.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.760
All right, that's it!
I've just had it
with all of you all!

14:59.899 --> 15:03.454
Oh, now calm down, George.
They were just kidding.

15:03.592 --> 15:05.525
Everybody likes
the bust.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.287
Don't you?

15:09.874 --> 15:11.496
Oh, oh, yes, yes.

15:11.634 --> 15:13.878
It's a... Oh, it's a great
likeness, George.

15:14.016 --> 15:15.984
Indeed, Mr. J.
It's simply smashing.

15:16.812 --> 15:18.227
It's very impressive.

15:18.365 --> 15:19.435
I love it, George.

15:19.573 --> 15:20.816
I swear.

15:22.128 --> 15:23.370
Oh, you do, huh?

15:23.508 --> 15:24.682
Sure.
Okay.

15:24.820 --> 15:28.065
If you swear so much,
swear on this Bible.

15:28.203 --> 15:29.445
Oh, now, George,
that's ridiculous.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.723
Uh-huh...
What about you, Willis?

15:31.861 --> 15:33.967
Uh, couldn't you just
take my word for it?

15:34.105 --> 15:35.831
Uh-huh... Okay.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.453
What about you, Bentley?

15:37.591 --> 15:38.868
I can't.
I'm not a citizen.

15:41.630 --> 15:45.254
That's it! Everybody get out!
Get out! Out! Out!

15:49.672 --> 15:50.984
Out!

15:51.122 --> 15:54.332
Yes, sir,
Mr. Jefferson, sir.
Oh...

15:54.470 --> 15:57.922
Them turkeys wouldn't know
great art if it walked up
and kissed them.

15:58.060 --> 16:00.476
Pop, look, don't pay
any attention to them.

16:01.443 --> 16:03.410
I think that the bust is...

16:03.548 --> 16:05.136
Well, it's
kind of interesting.

16:05.274 --> 16:06.448
Yeah, sure.

16:06.586 --> 16:07.932
I mean, it does look
like you...

16:10.590 --> 16:11.660
Jenny!

16:12.730 --> 16:14.111
I wanna talk with you.
Come on.

16:14.249 --> 16:16.251
Okay, okay, Lionel...

16:19.599 --> 16:22.360
Look, I don't care what
nobody thinks. I like it.

16:22.498 --> 16:23.948
Well, that's fine, George.

16:24.086 --> 16:26.192
Oh, but what am I
supposed to do with it?

16:26.330 --> 16:28.332
You ain't supposed
to do nothing with it.
Just look at it.

16:28.849 --> 16:30.058
Do we have to?

16:31.473 --> 16:32.681
I got a weak stomach.

16:34.545 --> 16:36.788
Florence!
Uh, okay, George.

16:36.926 --> 16:38.652
There's no point
in yelling at anybody.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.241
Let's just decide
where we're gonna put it.

16:41.379 --> 16:42.932
There ain't nothing
to decide, Weezy.

16:43.071 --> 16:44.658
It's gonna stay right here
in the living room.

16:44.796 --> 16:47.351
What? You mean, I gotta dust
Old Stone Face every day?

16:49.077 --> 16:51.527
You're damn right you do!
And don't be
calling it names!

16:52.942 --> 16:54.634
Uh, George,

16:54.772 --> 16:57.982
how about if we put it
out on the terrace?

16:58.120 --> 17:00.260
It's real nice
and airy out there.

17:00.398 --> 17:02.055
Forget about it, Weezy.

17:02.193 --> 17:04.230
I didn't lay out
all that money to be
target practice for the birds.

17:06.715 --> 17:08.855
George...
A lot of great friends
we got.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.374
They all laughed at it.

17:10.512 --> 17:12.755
Well, George,
they didn't mean anything.

17:12.893 --> 17:15.172
It just took them
by surprise.

17:15.310 --> 17:17.105
Yeah, and you were there
laughing, too, Weezy.

17:17.243 --> 17:19.797
With the other dummies.
Just another dummy going...

17:21.902 --> 17:24.008
Okay, that's it.

17:24.146 --> 17:25.803
Do you really wanna
hear the truth?

17:25.941 --> 17:28.599
I think this thing is
absolutely ridiculous.

17:28.737 --> 17:32.223
And I don't want it
around here staring at me
all the time.

17:32.361 --> 17:34.674
Then don't come into the
living room, 'cause that's
where it's gonna be.

17:34.812 --> 17:36.848
Oh, no, George, I will
not have it in here.

17:36.986 --> 17:38.574
Yes, you will.
Oh, no, I won't.

17:38.712 --> 17:40.093
Yes, you will.
No!

17:40.231 --> 17:42.026
George, you're
not Julius Caesar.

17:42.164 --> 17:43.579
And this is not
a Roman palace.

17:43.717 --> 17:44.994
This is our home.

17:45.133 --> 17:47.825
And I'll not turn it
into a wax museum.

17:47.963 --> 17:51.277
Well, I ain't gonna throw
it away. I bought it so
people could look at it.

17:51.415 --> 17:54.073
Wait a minute,
I'll take it down
to the store,

17:54.211 --> 17:55.453
where everybody
can see it.

17:55.591 --> 17:57.214
I don't need you
to see it.

17:57.352 --> 17:58.939
Sure, that's
what I'll do.

18:01.459 --> 18:04.048
Ain't nobody gonna tell me
I can't keep it down there.

18:04.186 --> 18:05.291
That's for sure.

18:24.172 --> 18:26.001
What do they know
about anything?

18:26.139 --> 18:28.245
You'd think your family
would understand,
wouldn't you?

18:28.383 --> 18:30.454
I mean, a man's got
to leave his mark.

18:30.592 --> 18:32.007
Something to prove that
he's been here,

18:32.145 --> 18:33.905
otherwise there ain't
no sense in showing up
at all.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.770
You know what you
and me need? A drink.

18:43.018 --> 18:44.330
Turn around, old buddy.

18:47.056 --> 18:49.369
Okay, okay...

18:51.992 --> 18:53.442
One for you

18:58.965 --> 19:00.449
Ah...

19:00.587 --> 19:02.071
Here's to you,
old buddy.

19:02.210 --> 19:03.659
Well, you ain't driving,
are you?

19:05.627 --> 19:06.904
Here's to you.

19:07.042 --> 19:08.733
I hope that you get
more respect than I did.

19:08.871 --> 19:11.702
And may all of your in-laws
come in the same color.

19:16.224 --> 19:18.295
Ah! Here, let me
give you a hand, old buddy.

19:23.231 --> 19:24.646
Hey, you know something?

19:24.784 --> 19:26.165
You ain't
a bad looking dude.

19:27.131 --> 19:29.823
Look at those eyes,
that mouth.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.653
You sure you ain't related
to Sidney Poitier?

19:33.793 --> 19:35.070
You know something?

19:35.208 --> 19:36.692
Maybe I should stick you
over here in the window,

19:38.522 --> 19:39.868
where you can
catch the sights.

19:42.077 --> 19:44.562
I never got much chance
to take in the sights
when I was a kid.

19:45.770 --> 19:47.151
I've been working
since I was a kid.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.637
Oh...

19:50.775 --> 19:52.570
Yeah, we were
so poor in them days.

19:53.433 --> 19:55.918
In fact, we were so poor,

19:57.541 --> 20:00.268
if they had food stamps
in them days,
we'd have ate them.

20:03.063 --> 20:04.893
Here, let me open this
so you can see better.

20:06.826 --> 20:08.276
Then I got married,

20:08.414 --> 20:10.692
and then pretty soon
Lionel came along.

20:10.830 --> 20:13.350
I had to work then.
I couldn't let them down,
could I?

20:13.488 --> 20:16.007
And then I made it
all the way.

20:16.145 --> 20:20.046
But see, money,
you just can't leave money,
'cause money ain't enough.

20:20.184 --> 20:21.944
I mean, people would
spend money,
after it's spent,

20:22.082 --> 20:23.498
nobody even knows
where it came from.

20:25.707 --> 20:27.743
No, I don't think
I'm gonna leave you
in the window.

20:27.881 --> 20:29.089
You might
get a sunburn.

20:31.713 --> 20:34.094
Now where should
I put you? Hmm...

20:34.233 --> 20:35.579
Let's see.

20:36.821 --> 20:38.167
I got it.

20:40.549 --> 20:42.275
Put you right here.

20:42.413 --> 20:45.416
Then you can keep an eye
on the cash register for me.

20:45.554 --> 20:47.487
I would
give you a better job,
but you're too short.

20:49.696 --> 20:53.286
Ah... No, the world
will never forget
George Jefferson.

20:53.424 --> 20:55.184
What?

20:56.565 --> 20:57.739
Oh.

21:00.189 --> 21:01.743
Hi, Pop.
Hi.

21:03.020 --> 21:04.746
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.853
Pop, I wanted to be
sure that you knew
that up there,

21:08.991 --> 21:10.303
I wasn't laughing at you.

21:10.441 --> 21:11.718
You don't have
to explain, Lionel.

21:11.856 --> 21:13.513
No, no, really, Pop.

21:13.651 --> 21:15.032
I don't think
the bust is funny.

21:15.170 --> 21:16.689
You don't?
No.

21:18.242 --> 21:19.795
You like it, huh?

21:20.209 --> 21:21.728
Well, uh...

21:21.866 --> 21:23.972
I think that
that bust is one of a kind.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.422
You do?
Mmm-hmm.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.252
Huh.
Well, it sure is special.

21:28.390 --> 21:31.117
You really mean it, huh?
Oh, of course I do, Pop.

21:31.255 --> 21:33.947
You mean, it's the kind
of stuff that you'd like
to keep around?

21:34.085 --> 21:35.570
Oh, yeah, man!

21:35.708 --> 21:37.330
Then you take it!
Huh?

21:39.643 --> 21:41.300
I mean, keep it
at your house.

21:41.438 --> 21:43.129
I mean, that's what
a legacy is all about.

21:43.267 --> 21:44.751
I pass it on
to my son,

21:44.889 --> 21:46.477
then you pass it on
to your son.

21:46.615 --> 21:47.892
I'll get something
to wrap it up in.

21:48.030 --> 21:49.618
Uh, Mr. Jefferson,
wait a minute...

21:49.756 --> 21:52.276
You don't
have to thank me, Jenny.
That's what fathers are for.

21:57.005 --> 21:58.386
I hope you're satisfied.

21:59.732 --> 22:02.390
Oh, look, Jenny,
let's take it home
for just a little while.

22:02.528 --> 22:04.184
I mean, after all,
it's not so bad.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.841
Name one good thing
about it.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.395
It doesn't eat.

22:07.533 --> 22:09.500
Well, neither does
a sick hippopotamus,

22:09.638 --> 22:10.950
but you're not gonna keep
that in our house either.

22:11.088 --> 22:13.124
Shh... Right now
that bust

22:13.262 --> 22:14.988
is the most
important thing
in my father's life.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.473
I can't say
no to him.

22:16.611 --> 22:17.991
You want me to do it?
No.

22:19.303 --> 22:20.684
We just can't
do that to Pop.

22:21.270 --> 22:22.858
Oh, brother...

22:22.996 --> 22:26.379
Imagine waking up
every morning to
this face staring at you.

22:27.104 --> 22:28.347
It's no big deal.

22:29.313 --> 22:31.522
My mom's been doing it
for 25 years.

22:34.491 --> 22:36.631
Yeah, I guess it could
have been worse.

22:36.769 --> 22:38.253
He could have pictured
himself on a horse.

22:41.049 --> 22:43.154
Where's your father?
He's in the back room.

22:43.292 --> 22:44.328
Is he okay?
Hmm...

22:44.466 --> 22:45.674
Yeah, he's fine.

22:45.812 --> 22:48.090
Oh, that's a relief.

22:48.228 --> 22:51.784
Oh, I wish I hadn't
said all those things
about that bust.

22:51.922 --> 22:53.130
I feel terrible.

22:53.268 --> 22:55.477
I should have seen
what it meant to him.

22:55.615 --> 22:57.859
Well, here we go.

22:57.997 --> 23:00.033
This should keep him warm
till you get him back to
his new home.

23:02.795 --> 23:03.796
Oh!

23:17.913 --> 23:20.744
Well, there goes my legacy.

23:23.263 --> 23:26.197
I guess this is
the right monument to
George Jefferson after all.

23:27.716 --> 23:29.408
Just a bunch of nothing.

23:31.962 --> 23:35.379
Forget it, Pop.
That bust doesn't
count anyway.

23:35.517 --> 23:37.036
Your real legacy's
alive and well.

23:37.174 --> 23:38.796
You know something?
It's right here with you.

23:38.934 --> 23:42.075
And it will always be alive.
Alive in me. In my kids.

23:43.732 --> 23:45.009
And in Mom.

23:45.734 --> 23:47.115
George, sweetheart,

23:47.253 --> 23:49.807
your kind of love
gets crazy sometimes.

23:49.945 --> 23:51.878
And you can make
a lot of noise.

23:52.016 --> 23:54.225
But we know what
you're really saying.

23:54.363 --> 23:57.159
"I'm George Jefferson,
and I'm a man.

23:57.297 --> 23:59.679
"I'm important.
Respect me."

23:59.817 --> 24:02.337
George, how can
we not respect you?

24:03.752 --> 24:05.685
Pop, we're your legacy.

24:06.617 --> 24:08.585
And you can't smash
that on the floor.

24:22.115 --> 24:23.565
Yeah, I guess
you're right, Weezy.

24:25.394 --> 24:26.982
The bust was a wrong idea.

24:28.674 --> 24:29.985
I should have had
my picture painted.

24:55.148 --> 24:59.290
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
