00:01.668 --> 00:03.420
- ♪

00:03.503 --> 00:04.587
- Amazing news.

00:04.671 --> 00:05.922
My mom is having a boy!

00:06.005 --> 00:07.173
- A boy? That's awesome.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.758
Baby boys are adorable.

00:08.842 --> 00:09.676
- At first.

00:09.759 --> 00:11.761
But then they grow up,

00:11.845 --> 00:14.013
and the house smells like armpit
and cooked feet.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.515
- I'll worry about that
when it happens.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.559
But guess what?

00:17.642 --> 00:18.852
My mom is letting me
decorate the nursery.

00:18.935 --> 00:23.606
I convinced her I'm responsible,
deadline oriented, and decisive.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.276
I may have oversold myself.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.820
I can't even decide
what color to paint the walls.

00:28.903 --> 00:29.404
Which one would you choose?

00:29.487 --> 00:31.865
- Um, the blue.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.116
- Which blue?

00:33.199 --> 00:34.284
French blue, summer sky,
morning mist, or tide pool?

00:34.367 --> 00:36.619
Bella?

00:36.703 --> 00:39.414
- Uh...the blue.

00:39.497 --> 00:40.373
- Uhhh!

00:40.457 --> 00:42.167
How am I ever gonna decide?

00:42.250 --> 00:43.126
- I don't know
what you're doing,

00:43.209 --> 00:44.919
but stay away from tide pool.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.421
Uh, you can drown in that shade.

00:48.047 --> 00:48.923
- How do you know
all about paint colors?

00:49.007 --> 00:50.175
- My stepmom Brenda
asked me to help her

00:50.258 --> 00:53.386
redecorate her bedroom
when she moved in with us.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.764
And by help, I mean she showed
me pictures in magazines

00:55.847 --> 00:58.141
and said, "Oh, do this."

00:58.224 --> 00:59.809
- Hey, do you
wanna help me decorate

00:59.893 --> 01:01.269
my baby brother's nursery?

01:01.352 --> 01:02.979
I could really use someone
with skills

01:03.062 --> 01:04.938
and a male point of view.

01:05.022 --> 01:05.522
- Are you kidding? Count me in.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.649
- Thanks, Newt.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.818
How 'bout you two?

01:08.902 --> 01:10.779
- I know if I say no
you'll never leave me alone.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.864
So yeah, can't wait.

01:12.947 --> 01:13.990
- I wish I could.

01:14.073 --> 01:14.866
I have to do
my community service hours.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.451
- Oh, we did ours last quarter.

01:16.534 --> 01:18.328
- Me, too.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.370
But be warned,
highway beautification

01:19.454 --> 01:23.917
is just a fancy term
for cleaning up roadkill.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.669
Also, possums
aren't always dead.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.047
They just appear to be.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.507
Good luck.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.344
- Hey, guys.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.221
Uh, there's not
too many choices left.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.306
- Yeah, we can either volunteer
at the retirement home

01:38.389 --> 01:39.724
or join the highway
beautification program.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.684
- Uh, beautification.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.978
I like the sound of that.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.021
- Apparently,
it's just a fancy term

01:45.104 --> 01:47.190
for cleaning up roadkill.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.192
- Retirement home it is.

01:49.275 --> 01:52.111
- Yeah.
- That's what I was thinking.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.155
- Hey, I bet it will be fun.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.157
You can learn a lot
from older generations.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.826
- Yeah. Just because
someone's in their 40s

01:57.909 --> 01:59.536
doesn't mean they're worthless.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.913
- That's true.

02:01.996 --> 02:05.375
After all, my grandpa taught me
how to wash a car, mow the lawn,

02:05.458 --> 02:08.711
make his favorite sandwich,
clip his toenails.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.755
Wait a minute.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.423

03:06.019 --> 03:06.936
{\an8}Did you see?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.105
{\an8}They have Taco Tuesday

03:09.188 --> 03:09.731
{\an8}The rules don't apply here.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.442
{\an8}I love this place!

03:12.525 --> 03:15.028
{\an8}- Well, we do try

03:15.111 --> 03:16.529
{\an8}These are active, happy seniors.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.780
{\an8}And matching them
with Senior Pals,

03:17.864 --> 03:21.117
such as yourselves,
really keeps their spirits high.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.160
That's Kit.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.870
He's a former astronaut.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.872
Many of our residents have led
rich, fascinating lives.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.290
Steve over there was a pilot.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.001
And we also have two
former Congressman.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.962
And Doris, she played baseball
for an all-woman's league.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.131
So I--
- Wait, Doris McKenna?

03:35.214 --> 03:35.965
- You've heard of her?

03:36.049 --> 03:36.966
- Yes.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.510
Doris "Cookie" McKenna
of the Lonestar Lassies.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.305
She's in a book I read called
"Stay Strong, Girl."

03:42.388 --> 03:43.890
It's a collection
of inspiring stories

03:43.973 --> 03:45.141
about women who beat the odds.

03:45.224 --> 03:47.310
- Does that come
in an audiobook

03:47.393 --> 03:48.811
so I can not listen to it?

03:48.895 --> 03:50.355
- TROY: [laughs]

03:53.566 --> 03:55.985
- Doris McKenna
is one of my heroes.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.529
Do you think you can assign me
to be her Senior Pal?

03:58.613 --> 03:59.822
Please!

03:59.906 --> 04:01.991
- I'm sorry. Doris didn't
sign up for the program.

04:02.075 --> 04:02.784
- Uh. That's too bad.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.827
- Don't worry, honey.

04:04.911 --> 04:05.787
I think I got someone
you're gonna love.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.164
Here she is now.

04:08.247 --> 04:09.082
Esther!

04:09.165 --> 04:10.166
- Oh, can't talk now!

04:10.249 --> 04:12.919
I'm training for a 5K!

04:13.002 --> 04:14.212
- Don't worry, Bella.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.713
You'll get your credit
for today.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.507
As for you guys,
we're slightly overbooked.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.344
So I'm gonna assign you
to the same Senior Pal.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.012
- It's Kit the astronaut,
isn't it?

04:23.096 --> 04:23.846
[laughs]

04:23.930 --> 04:25.556
- No, Ernie the mailman.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.975
And I think he needs
a little help learning

04:27.058 --> 04:29.269
how to use
his new computer tablet.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.770
- [computer beeping]

- TROY: Oh, man.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.442
- ♪

04:36.526 --> 04:38.319
- All right, girls,
I'll leave it to you. Have fun.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.821
But be extra careful
of the new carpeting.

04:39.904 --> 04:40.863
It's ecofriendly.

04:40.947 --> 04:41.781
Which is another way of saying
it's expensive.

04:41.864 --> 04:45.702
It's very expensive.

04:45.785 --> 04:46.703
- Don't worry.

04:46.786 --> 04:47.662
We'll take good care of it.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.205
- Besides,
we're not painting today.

04:49.288 --> 04:50.164
Just prepping.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.040
- Oh, Pepper,
I'm so proud of you.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.291
Oh now if you'll excuse me,

04:52.375 --> 04:55.378
I have a craving
for peanut butter on a burrito.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.505
[laughs] Anyone want one?
No. Okay.

05:01.634 --> 05:02.427
- Pregnant women are a mystery.

05:05.013 --> 05:08.808
- [laughs] This is so fun.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.977
- I can't believe you roped
poor Newt into this, too.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.562
- He said he wanted to help.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.730
- Well, I know,
I just don't think of Newt

05:13.813 --> 05:17.066
as a roll-up-your-sleeves
and get dirty kind of guy.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.651
- Somebody call my name?

05:21.988 --> 05:24.032
- Look at you.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.242
- Where'd you get
that tool belt?

05:26.325 --> 05:27.118
- Brenda.

05:27.201 --> 05:28.202
She's had a lot of work done.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.247
Wait, that didn't
come out right.

05:31.330 --> 05:32.540
Actually, it kinda did.

05:32.623 --> 05:35.668
Anyway, I've become pretty good
with room re-dos.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.962
First up, let's get rid
of this crummy carpet.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.922
- No! That is not an option.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.301
It's super expensive because
it's made from recycled sheep.

05:43.384 --> 05:46.471
Or something organic like that.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.222
- Okay, fine,
I can work with the carpet.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.974
But this room needs a theme.

05:50.058 --> 05:53.811
I'm thinking...bears.

05:53.895 --> 05:57.273
- Um, well, actually,
I was thinking of a train theme.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.608
I did a lot of research,

05:58.691 --> 06:00.610
and baby boys love
choo-choo trains in their room.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.529
- Well, I was a baby boy,
and I had bears in my room.

06:03.613 --> 06:08.284
Trains are loud and smoky,
but bears are soft and soothing.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.619
- Until they rip
someone's arm off

06:09.702 --> 06:12.455
and gnaw on it by a creek.

06:12.538 --> 06:16.542
- Oh, like trains don't
eat people every day.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.502
You know what? Never mind.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.088
Look, this room
is screaming for bears.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.798
- No,
it's screaming for trains.

06:21.881 --> 06:22.298
- Bears.
- Trains!

06:22.381 --> 06:22.840
- Bears.
- Trains!

06:22.924 --> 06:24.509
- Bears.
- Trains!

06:24.592 --> 06:26.302
- Wait, I have an idea.

06:26.385 --> 06:27.595
How 'bout little ducks?

06:27.678 --> 06:30.181
- Ew, no.
- Is she kidding?

06:30.264 --> 06:32.350
- ♪

06:32.433 --> 06:33.643
- Hi, Esther.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.978
It's Wednesday at 4:30,
time for scrapbooking.

06:36.062 --> 06:36.896
- Oh, sorry, kiddo,

06:36.979 --> 06:39.649
I'm volunteering
at the teen center today.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.526
Didn't you get my reminder
on Pencil In?

I don't have that app.

06:50.409 --> 06:53.287
I've available Tuesdays

Eeee-yah!

06:55.164 --> 06:55.581
Later.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.335
- Oh, dear, that one.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.504
If you wanna
keep her in the room,

07:01.587 --> 07:04.048
you gotta nail her feet
to the floor.

07:04.132 --> 07:07.135
I'd like to nail her mouth shut,
too, but that's just me.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.345
- You're Doris McKenna, right?

07:09.428 --> 07:10.388
- That depends.

07:10.471 --> 07:14.392
You're not
my ex-husband's lawyer, are you?

07:14.475 --> 07:17.186
No, you're too young.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.021
- Actually, I'm a fan.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.190
Hi, I'm Bella,
and I'm a female athlete, too.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.734
You really inspired me.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.819
I know everything about you.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.530
In fact, I even edited
your Wikipedia page.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.365
- Really?
Can you change my birthdate?

07:29.448 --> 07:31.868
I wanna be 50 again.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.369
- On it.

07:33.452 --> 07:35.538
Hey, is it really true
that you hit a triple

07:35.621 --> 07:38.291
off the Yankee's Whitey Ford
in an exhibition game?

07:38.374 --> 07:40.251
- No, it's not true.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.461
It was a homerun.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.131
That was in 1952.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.466
You know I was the highest paid
player on the ladies' league?

07:47.550 --> 07:51.429
And I still only got paid
$8 that season.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.389
It's tough being
a girl ballplayer.

07:53.472 --> 07:54.640
- I know something about that.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.727
I play quarterback
on the boy's football team.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.729
- Well, then you
must be tough, too.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.106
- Not tough enough to hit
a Whitey Ford fastball...

08:02.190 --> 08:04.233
but I can hold my own.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.234
- I don't doubt it.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.528
- One time
I got hit in practice,

08:07.612 --> 08:10.239
my shoulder popped out,
and I only missed one game.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.324

can I ask you something else?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.290
- Yeah.

08:19.373 --> 08:22.043
- Did you really tell off that
umpire the way they say you did?

08:22.126 --> 08:22.960
- It was worse.

08:23.044 --> 08:23.586
- Really?

08:23.669 --> 08:25.421
- Mm. Are you over 17?

08:25.504 --> 08:27.673
Because the language is R rated.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.218
Oh, heck, I'll tell you anyway.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.803

to Click Pic,

to connect to your grandkids.

now you're talking my language.

08:50.529 --> 08:51.530
- Well, in that case,
what we gotta do

08:51.614 --> 08:53.199
is sign you up
for a dating site.

08:53.282 --> 08:54.492

know what you're working with.

- Okay.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.673
- Come on, Ernie.

09:08.756 --> 09:11.676
To lure the ladies, you need
to project an air of mystery,

09:11.759 --> 09:13.177

09:13.261 --> 09:14.428
- Yeah, yeah.

But he belongs in this room.

He doesn't want to leave.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.834
- Yep, I guess I did.

17:23.916 --> 17:27.671
And if I'd known you were gonna
duck, I would have aimed lower.

17:27.755 --> 17:28.714
- I can't figure you out.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.883
This was a waste of time.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.217
I thought you were my hero,

17:32.301 --> 17:34.511
but it turns out you're nothing
but a mean, old witch.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.721
- Yep.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.265
- ♪

17:39.266 --> 17:42.436
- Okay, Pepper, we can do this.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.062
- Yep. You're right.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.815

in a few minutes.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.078
Maybe if I climb
out of the window

18:00.162 --> 18:01.497
and run away from home,

18:01.580 --> 18:03.499
my mother will be so upset
she won't even notice the hole.

18:03.582 --> 18:04.249
She won't.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.837
- Oh yeah, that'll work.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.216
- Hey, girls. Look who's back.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.634
[in deep voice] Did ya miss me?

18:14.760 --> 18:15.511
- Enough with the bear, Newt.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.554
- Just watch.

18:21.141 --> 18:22.643
- It covers it perfectly.

18:22.726 --> 18:23.268
- One more thing.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.025
Choo-choo.

18:30.108 --> 18:30.526
- Bears and trains.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.110
- BOTH: Who knew?

18:32.194 --> 18:35.280
- I can't take it anymore,
I'm coming in.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.199
Oh.

18:37.282 --> 18:41.537
Oh my gosh. What is that?

18:41.620 --> 18:43.163
- Um...

18:43.247 --> 18:44.540
- That bear
is a train conductor?

18:44.623 --> 18:47.000
That's adorable.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.043
- Thank you.

18:48.126 --> 18:50.379

Pepper.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.256
Oh. [laughs]

18:52.339 --> 18:53.841
Oh, just make sure you figure
out a way to patch the hole

18:53.924 --> 18:56.051

sees it,

18:56.134 --> 18:57.469

19:03.392 --> 19:03.892
Anyone else
you need to respond to?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.853

19:05.936 --> 19:07.813
Can't wait to meet these gals.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.606
Hey, Phyllis!

19:09.690 --> 19:10.941
Be there in a minute.

19:11.024 --> 19:12.943
- Oh, she seems to like you.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.737
- Yeah, I hope so,
she's my girlfriend.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.572
- What?

19:16.655 --> 19:18.115
- No way.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.075
- Wait, you've been making us
set you up on these dates

19:20.158 --> 19:21.660
and you already
have a girlfriend?

19:21.743 --> 19:22.244
- What am I supposed to do?

19:22.327 --> 19:23.912
She goes to bed at 5.

I gotta do something
with my nights.

Life is short.

Phyllis!

19:36.550 --> 19:38.010
- Yeah, man.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.971
He's such a player.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.473
Respect.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.850
You know I'm gonna go ask him
a couple of questions.

19:44.933 --> 19:45.851
I'll be back.

19:45.934 --> 19:46.852

do you have before your movie?
