WEBVTT

00:02.492 --> 00:04.554
I did not take $10
from your wallet.

00:04.578 --> 00:05.555
Yes, you did.

00:05.579 --> 00:07.890
No, you owed me 17 from that
time I bought you a t-shirt

00:07.914 --> 00:09.600
at the Stone Boys
concert, so I'm not...

00:09.624 --> 00:10.643
I've got to talk to you guys.

00:10.667 --> 00:13.312
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. I paid you back
for that in dimes, remember?

00:13.336 --> 00:14.397
You borrowed those from me.

00:14.421 --> 00:15.440
I've really gotta talk to you.

00:15.464 --> 00:18.401
Not now, Charlie. Plus, I had
Will pick up that CD for you,

00:18.425 --> 00:20.153
so I'm up like 23 at least.

00:20.177 --> 00:21.571
It's sort of a big
thing to me...

00:21.595 --> 00:22.947
Not now, Char, 23?

00:22.971 --> 00:24.365
...and I've thought about
how to say this...

00:24.389 --> 00:25.741
You're not getting
a penny from me

00:25.765 --> 00:27.201
Hey, what about my dimes?

00:27.225 --> 00:28.985
Those are dimes you
took from me, Claud.

00:29.895 --> 00:31.529
Kirsten's moving in.

00:34.775 --> 00:36.169
What?

00:36.193 --> 00:38.254
This isn't exactly how I
wanted to break the news,

00:38.278 --> 00:41.498
but, anyway, she's moving in...

00:41.740 --> 00:42.957
...with us.

00:42.991 --> 00:44.501
With me.

00:44.910 --> 00:47.430
Wow. Kind of fast,
isn't it, Charlie?

00:47.454 --> 00:48.890
Yeah, I mean, a month ago,

00:48.914 --> 00:50.641
you guys weren't even
talking to each other.

00:50.665 --> 00:53.551
Yeah, well, it's been a
pretty intense month for us,

00:54.044 --> 00:56.554
and, uh... this is what we want.

00:56.922 --> 00:58.232
We decided.

00:58.256 --> 01:01.235
She's really going to be here?
I mean, be here all the time?

01:01.259 --> 01:02.779
Isn't it great?

01:02.803 --> 01:04.896
She's going to live in
Mom and Dad's room?

01:05.263 --> 01:06.866
Yeah, in my room.

01:06.890 --> 01:09.651
I'm, uh... I'm moving
her stuff in today.

01:10.519 --> 01:12.955
Anyway, it's pretty
incredible news, huh?

01:12.979 --> 01:14.572
I can't believe you.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.408
I mean, you just
announce it like that?

01:17.901 --> 01:19.754
A person is moving
in with us to stay.

01:19.778 --> 01:21.798
Even if it is Kirsten.
It's a big deal.

01:21.822 --> 01:24.133
I mean, that changes
everything around here.

01:24.157 --> 01:26.135
No, it doesn't. I mean, Come on.

01:26.159 --> 01:27.544
She's right, Charlie.

01:27.577 --> 01:30.223
You did owe it to us to at least
talk to us about it first.

01:30.247 --> 01:31.464
What?

01:31.706 --> 01:32.850
You guys love Kirsten.

01:32.874 --> 01:34.175
That's not the point.

01:34.334 --> 01:37.220
You don't have the right to make a
decision about who lives in this house.

01:37.587 --> 01:38.721
Our house.

02:42.152 --> 02:43.536
Just keep moving forward.

02:45.864 --> 02:47.258
- Ow!
- What?

02:47.282 --> 02:49.000
Oh, God.

02:49.492 --> 02:51.127
Are you okay?

02:51.620 --> 02:53.254
- Ah!
- Let me see.

02:55.332 --> 02:57.467
Just a finger. I have more.

02:59.502 --> 03:00.887
What are you doing?

03:01.004 --> 03:02.597
Mutilating your brother.

03:03.882 --> 03:05.151
Just hoisting some furniture.

03:05.175 --> 03:06.319
That's mom's dresser.

03:06.343 --> 03:08.779
No kidding. The drawers
are kind of shallow.

03:08.803 --> 03:10.448
Kirsten has a big one we're
going to move in tomorrow.

03:10.472 --> 03:11.940
What?

03:12.057 --> 03:13.200
Where are you going to put it?

03:13.224 --> 03:14.535
I don't know. Garage, maybe.

03:14.559 --> 03:16.871
The garage? Charlie, this
is part of the bedroom set

03:16.895 --> 03:19.081
that Nana and Papa gave Mom
and Dad for their wedding.

03:19.105 --> 03:20.657
Really?

03:20.982 --> 03:22.209
Maybe we shouldn't
move it, Charlie.

03:22.233 --> 03:24.494
Oh, please, Jule. It's
like 30 years old.

03:24.778 --> 03:26.172
It's got a history, huh?

03:26.196 --> 03:28.341
Well, we played hide-and-seek
behind it when we were kids,

03:28.365 --> 03:29.800
and we'd put Claudia
in one of the drawers

03:29.824 --> 03:31.542
and pretend she was
in the morgue.

03:31.993 --> 03:34.504
You're really going to put it
in the garage and let it rot?

03:35.205 --> 03:37.475
You know what? I can
definitely use it.

03:37.499 --> 03:38.476
It'll work fine.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.552
No, um, move it in my room.
I'll use it.

03:42.087 --> 03:43.429
Whatever.

03:47.175 --> 03:48.685
Happy?

04:21.668 --> 04:23.052
Excuse me, sir.

04:23.294 --> 04:24.897
Uh, I can't decide.

04:24.921 --> 04:28.067
Would you recommend
calfskin or the alligator

04:28.091 --> 04:30.893
for someone who's into
the bondage scene?

04:33.763 --> 04:34.740
Jill...

04:34.764 --> 04:36.107
What?

04:37.225 --> 04:39.578
For God's sakes, Bailey,
just live it up a little.

04:39.602 --> 04:40.987
Check these out.

04:41.271 --> 04:42.697
Try them on.

04:47.318 --> 04:49.329
Oh, wow. They're you.

04:51.197 --> 04:52.665
Seventy bucks.

04:52.782 --> 04:53.968
Does the size fit?

04:53.992 --> 04:57.211
As if. I'm not paying 70
bucks for a pair of gloves.

04:57.328 --> 04:59.348
Come on. Let's, uh,
find the baby section.

04:59.372 --> 05:01.132
I'm going to get
that parka for Owen.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.134
You coming?

05:04.586 --> 05:06.596
Hey, I got an idea.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.608
Why don't we stop in the mattress
department on the way out,

05:09.632 --> 05:11.684
you know, and sample a few beds,

05:11.926 --> 05:14.113
see how many salespeople
we can freak out.

05:14.137 --> 05:15.938
Come on.

05:23.438 --> 05:24.864
What do you think?

05:25.023 --> 05:29.118
Nice. I mean, it's not exactly
"Silent Night," but it's nice.

05:29.861 --> 05:30.880
What's it for?

05:30.904 --> 05:33.340
I have to sing it when I'm called
to the Torah to be bar mitzvahed.

05:33.364 --> 05:36.501
Julia has this friend who got bar
mitzvahed a couple of years ago.

05:37.368 --> 05:40.222
What did she get? I think
she got a laser-disc player

05:40.246 --> 05:41.631
and some savings bonds.

05:41.998 --> 05:43.392
Savings bonds are stinky gifts.

05:43.416 --> 05:45.227
That's not the point, Claudia.

05:45.251 --> 05:47.146
You know, you could take
this more seriously.

05:47.170 --> 05:49.315
I mean, being Jewish
is important to me.

05:49.339 --> 05:52.443
What do you mean? I take
this very seriously.

05:52.467 --> 05:54.560
It's hard enough for
me to be kind of,

05:54.844 --> 05:57.688
you know, seeing someone
who isn't Jewish.

05:58.014 --> 06:00.493
If we got married, it would
just kill my grandmother.

06:00.517 --> 06:01.660
I don't want to do that.

06:01.684 --> 06:03.287
- Get married?
- Kill your grandmother.

06:03.311 --> 06:04.779
Oh.

06:05.772 --> 06:07.657
Artie, if we did get married...

06:08.024 --> 06:10.419
I mean, if, say, in the
next 10 to 15 years,

06:10.443 --> 06:13.130
I don't meet a single person I
like nearly as much as I like you,

06:13.154 --> 06:15.248
and, of course,
you don't either,

06:16.241 --> 06:17.875
what would we do religion-wise?

06:18.618 --> 06:19.961
That's a toughie.

06:20.203 --> 06:23.381
Statistics on the failure rate of
mixed marriages are staggering.

06:23.998 --> 06:26.217
Life is so complicated.

06:26.459 --> 06:29.679
It'd be nice if we believed in
the same thing, wouldn't it?

06:31.548 --> 06:33.641
I guess one of us could switch.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.477
I mean, you know, like...

06:37.470 --> 06:38.489
Convert?

06:38.513 --> 06:41.691
Oh, I couldn't do that.
I couldn't!

06:43.059 --> 06:44.360
Oh.

06:46.229 --> 06:48.823
"<i>September 27, 1982.</i>

06:48.857 --> 06:52.336
<i>The Haydn is a mess and I spent
the morning trying to talk Avery</i>

06:52.360 --> 06:54.287
<i>out of taking it
into the studio.</i>

06:54.404 --> 06:55.422
<i>We fought,</i>

06:55.446 --> 06:57.091
<i>and in the middle
of my histrionics,</i>

06:57.115 --> 06:59.500
<i>he said, "Let's try it
again right this second,"</i>

06:59.534 --> 07:01.220
<i>and, amazingly, it worked.</i>

07:01.244 --> 07:02.920
<i>He makes me better.</i>

07:04.163 --> 07:05.432
<i>October 21st.</i>

07:05.456 --> 07:07.893
<i>Nick and the boys took Avery
and me to the airport.</i>

07:07.917 --> 07:10.511
<i>Julia cried when I
kissed her goodbye.</i>

07:10.628 --> 07:13.232
<i>An awkward moment between
Nick and Avery at the gate.</i>

07:13.256 --> 07:15.734
<i>The flight was
coast-to-coast turbulence.</i>

07:15.758 --> 07:17.903
<i>Avery held my hand the whole
way and made me listen</i>

07:17.927 --> 07:21.115
<i>to a very bad recording of Mendelssohn
on the airplane headphones.</i>

07:21.139 --> 07:22.315
<i>It helped.</i>

07:23.391 --> 07:24.984
<i>October 22nd.</i>

07:25.101 --> 07:27.037
<i>Avery insisted we knock
off rehearsal early</i>

07:27.061 --> 07:28.289
<i>and go for a walk.</i>

07:28.313 --> 07:31.616
<i>We ended up on the Upper West
Side in a used book store.</i>

07:31.858 --> 07:34.503
<i>He bought me this ancient
edition of</i> Dante's Inferno.

07:34.527 --> 07:36.505
<i>I read the Paolo and
Francesca chapter</i>

07:36.529 --> 07:38.247
<i>when I got back to my room.</i>

07:39.157 --> 07:40.708
<i>It was so romantic.</i>

07:41.075 --> 07:42.011
<i>I just called home.</i>

07:42.035 --> 07:45.087
<i>but Nick's putting the kids
to bed and can't talk.</i>

07:45.288 --> 07:46.432
<i>November 1st.</i>

07:46.456 --> 07:49.800
<i>The recording session is over.
Seven takes of the Handel.</i>

07:50.084 --> 07:52.803
<i>My fault, all of them,
Avery got me through it.</i>

07:53.213 --> 07:55.566
<i>At the postmortem party, I
watched him across the room.</i>

07:55.590 --> 07:59.602
<i>and when he smiled at me, this
beautiful and warm smile,</i>

08:00.345 --> 08:01.530
<i>I actually looked
over my shoulder</i>

08:01.554 --> 08:04.148
<i>because I assumed it was
meant for someone else.</i>

08:04.974 --> 08:06.202
<i>We slipped out a back exit</i>

08:06.226 --> 08:08.569
<i>and took a carriage
ride around the park,</i>

08:08.853 --> 08:11.739
<i>around and around and around."</i>

08:13.983 --> 08:15.201
No. You have to guess.

08:15.735 --> 08:17.119
Okay.

08:17.737 --> 08:19.622
Soft, non-edible.

08:21.658 --> 08:23.084
I don't know. A rabbit?

08:23.493 --> 08:25.002
People eat rabbits.

08:25.995 --> 08:27.338
How big is it?

08:27.872 --> 08:30.341
"Yes or no" answers only.

08:30.541 --> 08:33.510
Okay, okay. Is it
bigger than my hand?

08:33.878 --> 08:36.222
I'd say it's pretty
much the same size.

08:36.965 --> 08:39.058
Yes. Yes.

08:43.804 --> 08:44.990
I don't know, Jill.

08:45.014 --> 08:47.316
Really, I'm terrible at this.
Just tell me.

08:47.392 --> 08:49.235
All right. Close your eyes.

08:56.693 --> 08:58.119
Okay. Open them.

08:59.654 --> 09:00.881
You like them?

09:00.905 --> 09:02.665
Like them? Are you kidding me?
Jill...

09:03.616 --> 09:04.927
These are a fortune.

09:04.951 --> 09:08.087
They'll keep your hands warm so we can
keep the top down all winter long.

09:08.204 --> 09:09.755
God, when did you...

09:10.081 --> 09:11.517
I didn't even see you buy these.

09:11.541 --> 09:12.893
Oh, I didn't...

09:12.917 --> 09:14.260
Buy them.

09:16.129 --> 09:17.471
Oh.

09:18.006 --> 09:20.141
See, the black
matches your Jeep.

09:20.675 --> 09:22.893
Oh, just put them on already.

09:28.599 --> 09:30.160
So which side do you want?

09:30.184 --> 09:31.611
We could flip a coin.

09:33.104 --> 09:35.448
Better yet, why don't we
just see where we end up?

09:39.402 --> 09:40.504
Charlie...

09:40.528 --> 09:41.797
What?

09:41.821 --> 09:43.289
They'll hear.

09:43.364 --> 09:44.999
No, they won't.

09:52.206 --> 09:54.268
Oh, it's so loud.

09:54.292 --> 09:55.551
I can't.

09:57.170 --> 09:59.555
I can't. It's embarrassing,

09:59.922 --> 10:03.100
you know, if I think
people can hear.

10:03.843 --> 10:04.862
Look, they know we're together.

10:04.886 --> 10:06.697
It's not going to come
as a total shock.

10:06.721 --> 10:09.774
I know, but, still,
I feel inhibited.

10:12.226 --> 10:14.153
Well, we can't
have that, can we?

10:16.356 --> 10:17.907
What are you doing?

10:48.304 --> 10:51.075
Snooping around to see what
kind of birth control they use?

10:51.099 --> 10:52.608
Oh, gross.

10:52.892 --> 10:54.276
What are you doing?

10:55.019 --> 10:56.997
Bay, when we packed up
Mom and Dad's stuff,

10:57.021 --> 10:58.698
do you remember
seeing any journals?

10:58.898 --> 11:01.158
No. Neither one of
them kept a journal.

11:01.692 --> 11:04.588
But that's not necessarily the
kind of stuff you'd know, right?

11:04.612 --> 11:07.007
I mean, let's say Mom
did keep a journal,

11:07.031 --> 11:10.042
and she hid it somewhere
so no one would see it.

11:10.118 --> 11:11.762
I mean, maybe we weren't
looking hard enough

11:11.786 --> 11:13.379
when we packed everything up.

11:14.205 --> 11:16.183
Well, we, we found
those love letters

11:16.207 --> 11:17.267
they wrote each other, remember?

11:17.291 --> 11:18.393
Mmm-hmm.

11:18.417 --> 11:20.845
We found that weird see-through
nightgown of Mom's.

11:21.003 --> 11:22.481
We found that picture
of Dad's butt

11:22.505 --> 11:24.640
that Mom took when
they went to Jamaica.

11:24.757 --> 11:27.309
I'd say we found all the stuff
they didn't want us to know about.

11:29.554 --> 11:31.397
It's weird seeing
her stuff here.

11:32.014 --> 11:33.399
Kirsten's.

11:35.101 --> 11:36.286
Hey, Kirsten?

11:36.310 --> 11:37.695
Mmm-hmm?

11:38.104 --> 11:39.530
What are you?

11:40.273 --> 11:41.416
What am I?

11:41.440 --> 11:43.617
What do you mean,
like what's my sign?

11:43.860 --> 11:46.245
No. Your religion. What are you?

11:46.612 --> 11:49.216
I'm... Well, I'm kind of
an agnostic, actually.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.666
No kidding?

11:50.783 --> 11:52.626
I don't know any of those.

11:53.870 --> 11:55.129
What is an agnostic?

11:56.497 --> 12:00.468
An agnostic is someone who
neither denies or accepts God.

12:01.252 --> 12:03.721
Nor. Neither, nor.

12:04.130 --> 12:05.890
You mean you don't
believe in God?

12:07.133 --> 12:10.311
The thing is, I don't
know for sure.

12:10.636 --> 12:12.739
That's what an agnostic is.
Someone who doesn't know.

12:12.763 --> 12:15.649
So, like, your family,
they're agnostics too.

12:15.933 --> 12:18.652
No, actually, they're
Episcopalians, like you guys.

12:18.686 --> 12:19.830
You mean you converted?

12:19.854 --> 12:21.697
No, not formally,

12:21.898 --> 12:24.626
but I thought about it a lot
and I tried to figure out

12:24.650 --> 12:26.410
you know, what
felt right for me.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.081
Say you and Charlie have kids,

12:31.657 --> 12:33.584
would you want them
to be agnostic?

12:36.120 --> 12:39.391
I'd like them to learn
as much as they can

12:39.415 --> 12:41.175
about all kinds of religions

12:41.250 --> 12:42.477
and then make up
their own minds.

12:42.501 --> 12:45.721
And you wouldn't be mad if it was
different from what you believed?

12:45.838 --> 12:49.433
Claudia, religion is a
very personal thing.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.570
Just because their parents
believe in something

12:51.594 --> 12:53.979
doesn't necessarily mean
that their kids have to.

12:56.140 --> 12:57.483
Right.

12:58.309 --> 12:59.568
Exactly.

13:00.811 --> 13:02.655
You're not having...

13:03.022 --> 13:05.157
A weird conscience
thing here, are you?

13:05.566 --> 13:07.034
A conscience thing?

13:07.318 --> 13:09.755
No, no. I'm not.

13:09.779 --> 13:11.256
It's just, uh...

13:11.280 --> 13:13.624
It's a practical thing with
me, You know, I figure

13:14.283 --> 13:16.460
why steal something that
you don't really need?

13:17.161 --> 13:19.755
Don't be a drag, Bailey.

13:21.249 --> 13:23.425
It's supposed to be
real clear tonight.

13:23.626 --> 13:25.427
You could put these on.

13:25.711 --> 13:29.181
We could take the top down
on the Jeep and just...

13:30.132 --> 13:31.308
...go.

13:31.425 --> 13:32.768
Yes.

13:33.469 --> 13:34.895
Yeah.

13:35.096 --> 13:36.564
No.

13:36.973 --> 13:38.148
What?

13:39.183 --> 13:40.577
Uh...

13:40.601 --> 13:43.946
I have this thing tonight,
this family thing.

13:44.105 --> 13:45.958
We eat dinner
together once a week.

13:45.982 --> 13:47.209
It's kind of a tradition.

13:47.233 --> 13:49.002
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:49.026 --> 13:50.411
You eat dinner together?

13:51.654 --> 13:55.165
We did that once, my family,
when I was, like, seven.

13:56.784 --> 13:58.877
No, really, it's very quaint.

13:59.453 --> 14:00.879
Can you get out of it?

14:01.747 --> 14:04.883
"Blessed art thou,
O Lord, our God,

14:05.293 --> 14:07.271
who commanded us to kindle... "

14:07.295 --> 14:08.596
Claud, what are you doing?

14:09.255 --> 14:11.181
The prayer over the
Sabbath candles.

14:11.799 --> 14:14.194
- Excuse me? -Well, I
wanted to do it in Hebrew,

14:14.218 --> 14:15.696
and they've got this
funny translation

14:15.720 --> 14:17.479
that I can't quite figure out.

14:18.264 --> 14:19.398
See...

14:23.436 --> 14:25.112
Claud, why are you doing this?

14:26.355 --> 14:27.666
You mean, 'cause
it isn't Sabbath?

14:27.690 --> 14:30.409
No, I mean, 'cause
we're not Jewish.

14:30.776 --> 14:32.036
Oh.

14:32.486 --> 14:36.165
Well, Jule, I kind of have
something important to tell you,

14:37.116 --> 14:38.969
and try to keep an
open mind about this,

14:38.993 --> 14:42.129
'cause I'm thinking about
it, about becoming Jewish.

14:42.330 --> 14:44.715
Artie and I have discussed
it pretty thoroughly,

14:44.749 --> 14:46.258
and, well, I'm thinking
of converting.

14:47.168 --> 14:48.677
You're not converting.

14:49.045 --> 14:51.180
I don't think it's really
your decision, Jule.

14:51.922 --> 14:53.734
It's not like making me
go to bed at bedtime.

14:53.758 --> 14:55.351
It's kind of a...

14:56.636 --> 14:58.020
A personal choice.

14:58.387 --> 15:00.407
Not for you. You're too young.

15:00.431 --> 15:02.149
That's not what Kirsten said.

15:02.975 --> 15:04.161
She said that every person has...

15:04.185 --> 15:06.163
I don't care what
Kirsten said, okay?

15:06.187 --> 15:08.489
Kirsten is not a part of
this family, Claudia.

15:09.148 --> 15:10.709
You don't just
change your religion

15:10.733 --> 15:12.044
like you would change
a stupid sweater.

15:12.068 --> 15:13.535
It's a part of who we are.

15:13.653 --> 15:14.954
Really?

15:15.196 --> 15:17.706
It didn't matter
much to Mom and Dad.

15:18.032 --> 15:21.178
I mean, it's not like we ever
went to church or anything.

15:21.202 --> 15:23.921
You don't have to go to church for
it to matter. It mattered to them.

15:26.207 --> 15:31.011
God, everyone is perfectly okay
with just throwing everything away.

15:31.587 --> 15:33.597
You're not converting
and that's final.

15:41.681 --> 15:43.742
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, kiddo.

15:43.766 --> 15:46.203
I'll get C.C. to set your
table up in a second.

15:46.227 --> 15:48.622
Oh, the others aren't here yet.
It's just me.

15:48.646 --> 15:50.916
Listen, you got a sec? I
need to ask you something.

15:50.940 --> 15:52.292
Yeah, shoot.

15:52.316 --> 15:54.910
Do you know a man
named Avery Baltus?

15:55.361 --> 15:57.172
Avery Baltus? God.

15:57.196 --> 15:59.456
I haven't heard that
name in a while.

15:59.699 --> 16:02.251
Yeah. He was a cellist, right?

16:02.576 --> 16:05.295
He and your mom used to
perform together for a while,

16:05.329 --> 16:07.099
and they made some recordings.

16:07.123 --> 16:09.101
What was he like?
Was he handsome?

16:09.125 --> 16:10.551
Never did a thing for me.

16:11.377 --> 16:12.886
Were Dad and he close?

16:13.003 --> 16:14.972
Uh, he was more
your mom's friend,

16:15.256 --> 16:16.682
or colleague.

16:16.924 --> 16:18.642
Why all the questions, Jule?

16:18.718 --> 16:21.571
So they weren't friends, Dad and this
guy, is that what you're saying?

16:21.595 --> 16:22.989
Well, no, but...

16:23.013 --> 16:24.565
Why didn't Dad like him?

16:25.182 --> 16:28.453
Uh, like I said, honey, it
was a very long time ago,

16:28.477 --> 16:30.080
so I don't know.

16:30.104 --> 16:33.115
Maybe they didn't hit
it off or something.

16:36.235 --> 16:38.078
Or maybe, uh...

16:38.195 --> 16:41.331
Dad didn't like him 'cause he was
having an affair with my Mom.

16:41.866 --> 16:43.250
What?

16:43.534 --> 16:44.835
Julia...

16:46.328 --> 16:48.881
Well, did they have an affair?

16:49.498 --> 16:51.675
Well, no, of course not.

16:51.959 --> 16:54.553
Come on, Joe. I'm old
enough to know the truth.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.057
Please? It's important.
I need to know.

17:02.678 --> 17:04.021
I don't know.

17:06.307 --> 17:07.900
You mean they might have?

17:08.434 --> 17:10.109
You mean it's possible?

17:12.354 --> 17:14.990
Honestly, Julia, I...
I don't know.

17:17.651 --> 17:19.243
Okay.

17:22.448 --> 17:25.626
Not exactly an amazing turnout
for your first family dinner.

17:26.367 --> 17:28.127
Usually no one misses it.

17:28.579 --> 17:30.631
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:30.873 --> 17:32.100
Where you been? We
waited for you.

17:32.124 --> 17:34.468
I came by early to talk to Joe.

17:36.462 --> 17:38.055
Where's Bailey going to sit?

17:39.924 --> 17:42.235
You know what? I'll
just pull up a chair.

17:42.259 --> 17:44.019
Yeah. I'll get you one.

17:51.101 --> 17:53.955
So, what do you guys order?
What's the usual?

17:53.979 --> 17:56.156
Anything except the manicotti.

17:56.732 --> 17:58.200
Hey.

17:58.943 --> 18:00.911
- Bailey.
- Sorry I'm late...

18:01.403 --> 18:02.663
We're late.

18:02.696 --> 18:04.331
Thanks for inviting me.

18:05.491 --> 18:06.750
So...

18:07.076 --> 18:08.710
We don't really have the room.

18:09.203 --> 18:10.388
Well, I guess we'll
just have to move

18:10.412 --> 18:11.556
to a bigger table,
then, won't we?

18:11.580 --> 18:13.225
This is the table
we always sit at.

18:13.249 --> 18:15.843
Well, tonight we'll sit over there, okay?
It's no big deal.

18:16.043 --> 18:18.104
Joe, we're going to
sit over there, okay?

18:18.128 --> 18:19.314
Yeah, go ahead.

18:19.338 --> 18:21.431
I thought this was
a family dinner.

18:21.465 --> 18:22.859
Can I talk to you for a second?

18:22.883 --> 18:24.977
Yeah. Sit down.

18:25.511 --> 18:26.979
Be right back.

18:32.393 --> 18:33.745
What's the problem?

18:33.769 --> 18:36.122
What's going on, Bay? I
mean, why is she here?

18:36.146 --> 18:38.448
Jill? Because I want her here.

18:39.275 --> 18:41.628
Come on. We always said this
was a family thing, right?

18:41.652 --> 18:44.673
We don't bring other people, we don't
make other plans. It's just us.

18:44.697 --> 18:47.916
You've got to be kidding me. You're saying
this with Kirsten sitting right there?

18:48.242 --> 18:49.135
That is different.

18:49.159 --> 18:50.220
How the hell is that different?

18:50.244 --> 18:51.513
Keep your voice down.

18:51.537 --> 18:53.348
It's different because
she's living with me.

18:53.372 --> 18:55.475
Because this is serious with
us, and she's part of my life,

18:55.499 --> 18:57.551
which means that she's
part of this family...

18:57.585 --> 18:59.261
Not some first date.

18:59.461 --> 19:01.763
For your information, this
is not some first date.

19:02.047 --> 19:04.734
You know what, Bay? You're taking advantage
here, and it's not fair to the others.

19:04.758 --> 19:06.194
So in other words, you
get to change the rules

19:06.218 --> 19:08.446
about how things work around
here, and no one else does.

19:08.470 --> 19:11.408
Yeah, you got it. You
really understand.

19:11.432 --> 19:13.025
Yeah, well, screw that.

19:13.517 --> 19:14.911
I'll tell you what, Char,

19:14.935 --> 19:17.571
you send Kirsten home,
and I'll send Jill home.

19:17.688 --> 19:19.364
How's that for a solution?

19:22.526 --> 19:24.786
I guess we're all having
dinner together, then, huh?

19:38.792 --> 19:39.927
Kirsten.

19:41.503 --> 19:42.804
Kirsten.

19:43.172 --> 19:44.640
Claud?

19:45.549 --> 19:47.809
Why are you guys
sleeping on the floor?

19:48.260 --> 19:49.728
Mmm.

19:49.762 --> 19:51.230
What do you want, Claud?

19:52.056 --> 19:53.815
I don't feel so good.

19:54.516 --> 19:57.527
I'm all sweaty, and my
stomach really hurts.

19:58.145 --> 19:59.655
Let me feel.

20:00.564 --> 20:02.241
I think I'm going to throw up.

20:04.860 --> 20:06.212
You want me to go with you?

20:06.236 --> 20:07.797
- Yeah.
- You don't have to.

20:07.821 --> 20:10.332
No, it's okay. I don't mind.

20:22.002 --> 20:23.387
Claud, you okay?

20:23.671 --> 20:25.639
She'll be fine.
Go back to sleep.

20:26.590 --> 20:28.475
Oh, I hate throwing up.

20:28.759 --> 20:31.270
I know. I'm right here.

20:31.845 --> 20:33.522
I'm right here.

20:33.806 --> 20:35.107
It's okay.

20:37.309 --> 20:39.486
Hey, you didn't have to wait up.

20:40.145 --> 20:41.905
She's going to be fine.

20:42.773 --> 20:45.200
It's probably just a
24-hour bug or something.

20:45.401 --> 20:46.503
Anyway, I got her cleaned up

20:46.527 --> 20:49.079
and changed nighties and
had some ginger ale.

20:49.780 --> 20:52.040
I read her <i>Harriet the Spy.</i>

20:54.576 --> 20:55.919
What?

20:56.328 --> 20:57.796
I love you.

20:58.580 --> 21:00.007
Well, I love you too.

21:00.290 --> 21:02.134
No. That's not...

21:05.671 --> 21:07.440
I didn't say it to
hear it said back.

21:07.464 --> 21:09.266
I just wanted you to know.

21:11.885 --> 21:15.022
I am totally, completely
in love with you.

21:16.223 --> 21:17.784
I love you being here.

21:17.808 --> 21:20.944
I love that you got up for her just
now, without even thinking about it.

21:32.072 --> 21:34.708
Claud wanted you.
She asked for you.

21:39.997 --> 21:41.558
All right, and this is, uh...

21:41.582 --> 21:43.560
...some sort of
research project?

21:43.584 --> 21:45.770
Yes, we're, um... We're
supposed to investigate

21:45.794 --> 21:49.014
the early works and recordings
of an important musician.

21:49.423 --> 21:50.692
Important musician?

21:50.716 --> 21:52.809
I see, and you got me?

21:52.885 --> 21:54.353
I got you.

21:56.096 --> 21:57.272
Yes.

21:57.389 --> 22:01.828
Oh, um, you did some recordings
in New York in the early '80s.

22:01.852 --> 22:03.872
That's right. That's right.
Columbia Masterworks.

22:03.896 --> 22:04.998
Well, you've done your homework.

22:05.022 --> 22:06.531
A series of duets.

22:06.857 --> 22:08.668
Right, for cello and violin.

22:08.692 --> 22:10.911
With a violinist named, um...

22:11.403 --> 22:12.839
Sorry. I don't remember.

22:12.863 --> 22:14.998
Diana Gordon Salinger.

22:16.450 --> 22:18.678
S-A-L-I-N-G-E-R.

22:18.702 --> 22:20.045
Thanks.

22:23.791 --> 22:24.925
Digs.

22:26.126 --> 22:27.187
What?

22:27.211 --> 22:30.430
That's the name I
used to call her.

22:30.923 --> 22:33.433
From the letters in
her name, "Digs."

22:34.468 --> 22:35.936
She hated it.

22:36.136 --> 22:37.687
Used to swat me.

22:40.057 --> 22:41.858
It's, uh... It's sad.

22:42.267 --> 22:43.819
She died.

22:44.603 --> 22:46.655
God, it must be almost
a year ago now.

22:49.066 --> 22:50.043
Really?

22:50.067 --> 22:52.911
Well, we had lost touch
long before that.

22:55.739 --> 22:58.458
Oh, she was a
wonderful violinist.

22:59.368 --> 23:02.337
You never knew what
she was going to do,

23:03.121 --> 23:05.507
where her music was
going to take her.

23:07.042 --> 23:10.220
She was completely
impossible to play with.

23:12.089 --> 23:13.890
She was, she was my favorite.

23:15.801 --> 23:17.821
I'm sorry. This is not
what you came for.

23:17.845 --> 23:20.730
Uh, no, um... It's
really helpful.

23:21.682 --> 23:24.077
I'm interested in these
recordings you did.

23:24.101 --> 23:26.903
Well, they would be
very hard to find.

23:27.145 --> 23:29.447
They were the only
recordings she ever made.

23:31.024 --> 23:32.242
Really? Why?

23:32.484 --> 23:33.827
She quit...

23:33.986 --> 23:36.288
Uh, to raise a family.

23:37.364 --> 23:38.957
Two boys and a girl.

23:39.867 --> 23:41.251
It's a shame.

23:42.286 --> 23:44.796
Not for them. For me.

23:47.332 --> 23:52.137
I could show you a picture. She
really was quite beautiful.

23:56.258 --> 24:00.145
I'm sorry. This is ridiculous.
I'm very embarrassed.

24:01.388 --> 24:03.315
It's just that, uh...

24:07.311 --> 24:09.362
I really was in love with her.

24:12.065 --> 24:13.617
Well, uh...

24:14.026 --> 24:15.327
I'm sorry. Is there
anything else?

24:17.029 --> 24:18.330
Uh...

24:19.823 --> 24:21.208
No.

24:22.826 --> 24:24.586
Bailey, look at these.

24:26.788 --> 24:28.006
I love them.

24:28.916 --> 24:31.176
Yeah, you look great.
How much are they?

24:32.127 --> 24:34.471
Fifty five dollars? Wow.

24:35.339 --> 24:36.932
I want them.

24:37.591 --> 24:40.320
Can you afford a $55 pair of shades?
'Cause I can't.

24:40.344 --> 24:42.562
No, I can't afford them at all,

24:43.555 --> 24:45.106
but I want them.

24:47.851 --> 24:48.912
Jill...

24:48.936 --> 24:51.122
I got you something
the other day.

24:51.146 --> 24:52.364
Jill...

24:52.731 --> 24:54.032
I want them.

25:21.176 --> 25:22.435
Hey, buddy.

25:23.845 --> 25:24.948
Yeah?

25:24.972 --> 25:26.898
Take your hand out of
your pocket, please.

25:36.108 --> 25:37.367
I got him.

25:41.363 --> 25:42.789
Hey, Julia.

25:43.907 --> 25:44.842
What's that?

25:44.866 --> 25:46.334
Matzo Ball Soup.

25:46.451 --> 25:48.179
Special request
from your sister.

25:48.203 --> 25:50.255
She thought it was the only
thing her stomach could handle.

25:51.623 --> 25:53.601
So what are your plans for
the rest of the afternoon?

25:53.625 --> 25:55.302
Enrolling her in Hebrew school?

25:56.503 --> 25:58.648
- What?
- Or maybe after that

25:58.672 --> 26:02.267
you could rearrange the furniture,
get rid of some more stuff.

26:02.300 --> 26:04.153
How about Mom's piano? I mean,
none of us really use it.

26:04.177 --> 26:05.822
It just takes up space, right?

26:05.846 --> 26:07.073
Julia, come on.

26:07.097 --> 26:09.733
You told Claudia that it was
okay for her to convert.

26:10.267 --> 26:11.244
Convert.

26:11.268 --> 26:12.569
I did not.

26:12.769 --> 26:15.498
I told her she had to make up her
own mind about what she believed.

26:15.522 --> 26:16.916
And who are you
to tell her that?

26:16.940 --> 26:18.584
She came to me. She asked me.

26:18.608 --> 26:20.169
So it's okay, then,
for you to tell her

26:20.193 --> 26:22.662
she just can just walk away
from what Mom and Dad believed?

26:24.114 --> 26:26.458
Look, maybe I should've
handled it differently.

26:26.867 --> 26:27.844
I didn't mean to...

26:27.868 --> 26:29.502
To act like you're her mother.

26:29.953 --> 26:31.880
That's what you're
doing, you know.

26:32.664 --> 26:35.175
Giving her advice,
making her soup.

26:36.918 --> 26:38.970
She comes to me when she's sick.

26:39.713 --> 26:41.264
Well, I'm sorry.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.391
She didn't this time.

26:45.343 --> 26:47.155
That's 'cause you've
got her all confused.

26:47.179 --> 26:49.615
I mean, we have had enough
changes around here as it is.

26:49.639 --> 26:51.107
We don't need anymore.

26:59.441 --> 27:00.992
She's disappearing.

27:02.736 --> 27:04.746
My mom is disappearing,

27:06.364 --> 27:09.751
and every time you
guys move her things

27:10.368 --> 27:13.213
or tell Claudia that it's okay
for her to be something else,

27:13.747 --> 27:16.049
there's less and less
of her in this house.

27:18.460 --> 27:21.638
And pretty soon, there's not gonna
be anything left of her at all.

27:30.180 --> 27:32.816
Look, I'm sorry, man.
I know it was stupid.

27:33.058 --> 27:34.401
Stupid?

27:35.852 --> 27:37.246
Stupid doesn't begin
to cover it, Bay.

27:37.270 --> 27:38.863
Okay, so I screwed up.

27:39.523 --> 27:40.792
What's the worst
they can do, huh?

27:40.816 --> 27:41.834
They could arrest you.

27:41.858 --> 27:43.544
In fact, that's probably what
they're doing right now,

27:43.568 --> 27:45.370
calling the police, getting
ready to haul you off,

27:45.445 --> 27:48.633
and you'd better believe that I'm gonna let
you sit on your ass in jail overnight.

27:48.657 --> 27:50.917
They'd do that over a
lousy pair of sunglasses?

27:51.451 --> 27:53.805
- I don't think so. -Yeah, it's
pretty obvious you don't think.

27:53.829 --> 27:55.264
Hey, leave her out of this.

27:55.288 --> 27:56.557
Was this her idea?

27:56.581 --> 27:57.924
Jill.

27:58.083 --> 27:59.477
Feel free to call me Jill.

27:59.501 --> 28:01.344
No, it wasn't.

28:01.878 --> 28:04.180
You're just into ladies'
sunglasses, is that it?

28:04.548 --> 28:06.349
Is there something you
want to tell me, Bay?

28:07.134 --> 28:09.477
Well, you're lucky, son.

28:10.262 --> 28:12.313
The management's decided
not to press charges.

28:12.722 --> 28:14.450
Thank you, sir. Thanks.

28:14.474 --> 28:16.192
We really appreciate that, Mr.
Thurman,

28:16.476 --> 28:18.319
and it won't happen again.
I promise.

28:18.937 --> 28:19.956
Isn't that right, Bay?

28:19.980 --> 28:21.281
Yes.

28:21.523 --> 28:24.033
I mean, no, it won't
happen again, sir.

28:28.321 --> 28:29.715
Julia, I need to talk to you.

28:29.739 --> 28:31.708
- Charlie...
- It can't wait.

28:33.034 --> 28:34.669
In my room, now.

28:49.384 --> 28:51.904
I heard about what
happened yesterday.

28:51.928 --> 28:53.239
- Charlie, you don't have to...
- Great.

28:53.263 --> 28:54.981
So this is how it works?

28:55.098 --> 28:56.784
I'm not tattling on you, Julia.

28:56.808 --> 28:57.910
Really.

28:57.934 --> 28:59.412
I just think we all
need to sit down and...

28:59.436 --> 29:00.580
I think you owe her an apology.

29:00.604 --> 29:02.989
- Forget this.
- Charlie, stop.

29:06.318 --> 29:08.453
Maybe we started out on
the wrong foot here.

29:09.738 --> 29:12.675
I think we probably should have come and
talked to you guys before I moved in.

29:12.699 --> 29:14.250
Yeah, you should have.

29:14.618 --> 29:16.127
We made a mistake.

29:16.286 --> 29:18.598
That still doesn't give you the
right to make her feel unwelcome.

29:18.622 --> 29:19.515
Charlie...

29:19.539 --> 29:22.008
You actually think she wants to
come in here and replace Mom?

29:22.375 --> 29:23.551
Do you?

29:23.668 --> 29:25.929
You actually think she
wants to be your mother?

29:27.172 --> 29:28.848
Damn right she doesn't,

29:28.924 --> 29:30.193
any more than I
want to run around

29:30.217 --> 29:32.435
acting like some
replacement for Dad.

29:32.886 --> 29:34.655
Chasing after Bailey,
dealing with you...

29:34.679 --> 29:36.356
I'm sick of it half the time.

29:37.015 --> 29:38.608
Okay, Charlie.

29:39.267 --> 29:41.945
I'm not trying to take
anyone's place, Julia.

29:43.146 --> 29:46.157
I don't know what's going on with
you, 'cause you seem so sensitive.

29:50.570 --> 29:52.664
I feel like I'm losing her.

29:54.449 --> 29:55.384
Julia...

29:55.408 --> 29:58.253
And I don't want to talk about it,
because it's really not your fault.

30:00.288 --> 30:02.882
She is not disappearing,
okay, Jule?

30:04.334 --> 30:06.678
I'm not going to get rid
of any of her stuff,

30:06.711 --> 30:09.305
and no one is going
to replace her.

30:09.923 --> 30:11.558
I promise,

30:12.425 --> 30:15.520
and actually, not that much
has changed around here.

30:16.638 --> 30:18.106
I know.

30:18.348 --> 30:20.034
All we want is to be together,

30:20.058 --> 30:22.119
and we've got to do
it in this house,

30:22.143 --> 30:24.612
because I don't have any choice.

30:24.771 --> 30:27.365
It's not like I can go off
and get myself a place.

30:27.649 --> 30:30.743
I know how much you give
up for us, Charlie.

30:33.488 --> 30:37.250
All I'm asking is just that you
cut us a little slack here.

30:38.493 --> 30:39.752
I mean,

30:39.995 --> 30:42.589
come on, give us half the
chance to make this work.

30:43.081 --> 30:44.924
It's not too much to ask.

30:46.334 --> 30:47.552
No.

30:48.670 --> 30:50.638
It's not too much to ask.

30:53.508 --> 30:56.728
So what's the deal
with pork and stuff?

30:57.262 --> 30:58.771
That's only if you're kosher.

30:58.930 --> 31:00.523
You can't have pork or shrimp,

31:00.849 --> 31:03.610
and you can't have a hamburger
and milkshake at the same time.

31:04.352 --> 31:06.529
Oh. Brutal.

31:07.439 --> 31:09.240
But you don't have to be kosher.

31:09.691 --> 31:11.002
We're not kosher.

31:11.026 --> 31:12.911
Oh, good. That's easier,

31:13.945 --> 31:17.373
because I'm already having a
little trouble with my family

31:17.574 --> 31:19.167
on the conversion issue.

31:19.284 --> 31:21.169
- They're pissed?
- Yeah.

31:21.786 --> 31:23.973
Well, historically,

31:23.997 --> 31:25.882
Jews have always
been persecuted.

31:26.374 --> 31:28.468
So you're saying I should
just get used to it?

31:28.710 --> 31:29.969
Yeah.

31:30.462 --> 31:32.055
It's just tough.

31:33.548 --> 31:35.276
I'm sorry. I should
quit complaining.

31:35.300 --> 31:36.611
Oh, no.

31:36.635 --> 31:37.862
If you're really
becoming Jewish,

31:37.886 --> 31:39.938
you should never apologize
for complaining.

31:41.723 --> 31:44.525
I just can't figure it
out about religion,

31:45.101 --> 31:46.370
if it's something
you believe in,

31:46.394 --> 31:49.113
or if it's just, you
know, something you are,

31:49.939 --> 31:52.668
and if it's something you are,
then how can you convert?

31:52.692 --> 31:54.661
And if it's something
you believe in,

31:55.028 --> 31:56.672
then how can I convert
until I believe in it?

31:56.696 --> 31:59.874
I'm sorry. Could you
run that by me again?

32:00.325 --> 32:01.510
Maybe becoming Jewish

32:01.534 --> 32:03.836
could really be important
to me some day.

32:04.621 --> 32:06.422
Hey, like it is to you.

32:07.082 --> 32:09.133
I just have to learn
more about it.

32:09.793 --> 32:11.094
Like...

32:11.336 --> 32:13.471
What are all those
names on the wall?

32:13.922 --> 32:15.682
Those are people who died.

32:16.049 --> 32:17.558
It's to remember them,

32:18.343 --> 32:19.445
and there's this special prayer

32:19.469 --> 32:21.145
that we say to
remember them too.

32:21.262 --> 32:22.198
Really?

32:22.222 --> 32:23.240
Yeah.

32:23.264 --> 32:25.108
It's called the
"Mourners' Kaddish."

32:25.308 --> 32:27.110
Can you teach it to me?

32:34.901 --> 32:36.619
I don't even want
to talk about it.

32:37.445 --> 32:39.038
He's such a stupid hypocrite.

32:39.114 --> 32:42.125
Yeah, well, he's over 20.

32:42.575 --> 32:44.419
That's what happens to people.

32:44.452 --> 32:46.921
I mean, you wouldn't believe
some of the stuff that he did.

32:47.038 --> 32:48.182
You know, he holds the record

32:48.206 --> 32:51.185
for most days being sent to the
principal's office in a row.

32:51.209 --> 32:53.302
Nine. Nine days.

32:53.670 --> 32:57.525
That's like, that's like, eight years
ago, and the record still stands.

32:57.549 --> 32:58.984
What's your point, Bailey?

32:59.008 --> 33:01.987
My point is, is that I don't
want to hear it from him.

33:02.011 --> 33:03.948
I don't want to hear
how I screwed up

33:03.972 --> 33:06.274
or how, how disappointed he is,

33:06.474 --> 33:09.027
like it's some big
deal, I mean, so what?

33:09.686 --> 33:11.372
So I took something. So what?

33:11.396 --> 33:13.531
Exactly. So what?

33:15.024 --> 33:17.211
It just, it just pisses
me off, that's all.

33:17.235 --> 33:18.745
Well,

33:19.320 --> 33:20.955
at least Charlie came down.

33:21.865 --> 33:23.249
What?

33:23.742 --> 33:26.669
No one in my family was
even around to bail me out.

33:28.037 --> 33:30.307
I mean, a little anger is
better than being ignored.

33:30.331 --> 33:32.717
Yeah? I don't think so.

33:32.751 --> 33:34.343
Well, trust me, okay?

33:34.669 --> 33:36.596
It's 'cause you're not ignored.

33:39.048 --> 33:42.351
Well, I wouldn't mind if
my whole family just,

33:44.095 --> 33:46.314
left me the hell alone
once in a while.

33:53.021 --> 33:54.530
You're Julia, her daughter,

33:55.190 --> 33:56.949
her little girl, all grown up.

33:57.859 --> 33:59.253
I went back and looked
at the recordings.

33:59.277 --> 34:01.881
I hadn't looked at
them in a long time,

34:01.905 --> 34:03.799
and there on the liner notes
was the picture of her.

34:03.823 --> 34:05.541
It could've been a
picture of you.

34:05.867 --> 34:07.835
I don't know why I didn't
put it together right away.

34:08.411 --> 34:10.713
I'm sorry. I should've
said something.

34:10.789 --> 34:13.768
Well, these are tapes of
our recording sessions.

34:13.792 --> 34:15.885
I thought you might
like to hear them.

34:17.670 --> 34:19.222
I would. Thanks.

34:32.936 --> 34:34.654
Uh...

34:35.522 --> 34:38.032
So it was really her you
wanted to know about?

34:38.233 --> 34:40.909
Not me. Why didn't you just ask?

34:41.569 --> 34:43.088
I thought if you knew who I was,

34:43.112 --> 34:45.331
you wouldn't be honest with me,

34:46.616 --> 34:48.458
about who you were
to each other.

34:48.576 --> 34:49.918
Who we were?

34:50.286 --> 34:51.754
We were friends, Julia.

34:52.705 --> 34:54.172
I can handle the truth.

34:55.792 --> 34:57.844
So my mom had an affair.

34:58.419 --> 34:59.679
With you.

35:00.880 --> 35:04.058
So I should know that, right?

35:04.217 --> 35:07.728
So I don't walk around thinking my
parents had this perfect marriage.

35:08.388 --> 35:10.148
We didn't have an affair, Julia.

35:10.890 --> 35:12.650
You said you were
in love with her.

35:13.393 --> 35:14.735
You told me.

35:14.978 --> 35:16.320
I was in love with her.

35:17.105 --> 35:18.865
And she was in love with you.

35:20.817 --> 35:22.410
I read her journals.

35:22.986 --> 35:24.495
I know...

35:25.738 --> 35:27.248
I know about New York.

35:28.700 --> 35:30.168
New York?

35:33.955 --> 35:35.464
You want to know the truth?

35:37.041 --> 35:39.927
The truth was, it was
a beautiful night,

35:40.003 --> 35:41.689
and we had just played Bach

35:41.713 --> 35:45.224
better than we ever played
it in our entire lives,

35:45.967 --> 35:47.903
and we had too much to drink

35:47.927 --> 35:51.731
and too many people telling
us how wonderful we were,

35:52.515 --> 35:55.369
and she had on this
long, black dress,

35:55.393 --> 35:59.999
and she lost her barrette
someplace around 6th Avenue,

36:00.023 --> 36:03.910
and her hair was just
whipping all over the place,

36:05.445 --> 36:08.497
and she was 32 and
away from home,

36:09.574 --> 36:12.293
and I told her I was
in love with her.

36:15.705 --> 36:17.215
And for a moment,

36:18.541 --> 36:20.092
it might've happened,

36:22.045 --> 36:23.596
but, uh,

36:24.172 --> 36:26.474
when we got back
to the hotel, uh,

36:26.841 --> 36:30.228
her room was filled
with flowers.

36:30.678 --> 36:33.272
Dozens of flowers. They
were from your father.

36:34.557 --> 36:36.660
There was a note, she
wouldn't let me read it,

36:36.684 --> 36:38.236
but it made her laugh.

36:38.978 --> 36:42.406
She just sat on the bed
and laughed and laughed,

36:43.566 --> 36:45.409
and I knew I had lost her.

36:46.653 --> 36:50.122
We played duets together
for a short time, Julia,

36:51.407 --> 36:53.376
but she was in love
with your father.

36:54.118 --> 36:55.711
There was never one second,

36:56.079 --> 37:00.591
never one second, where
that wasn't the truth.

37:07.882 --> 37:09.308
Were they lilies?

37:10.301 --> 37:11.727
'Cause, uh,

37:12.553 --> 37:14.981
'cause he would bring her
lilies home sometimes.

37:16.766 --> 37:18.109
Yes.

37:18.768 --> 37:20.152
They were lilies.

37:39.956 --> 37:41.507
Yeah? Who is it?

37:43.209 --> 37:44.478
Did you buy this
new creme rinse?

37:44.502 --> 37:46.345
'Cause it sucks big time.

37:46.504 --> 37:48.014
My hair's all in knots.

37:48.297 --> 37:49.640
You want me to...

37:49.841 --> 37:51.100
I don't know.

37:51.175 --> 37:52.560
You still mad at me?

37:54.345 --> 37:55.938
I'll try not to talk, okay?

37:56.222 --> 37:57.523
Okay.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.068
Thanks.

38:06.357 --> 38:08.711
Jule, I kind of got to thinking.

38:08.735 --> 38:11.704
Maybe I shouldn't convert
to Judaism after all.

38:12.697 --> 38:13.914
No?

38:14.198 --> 38:15.499
Why not?

38:16.159 --> 38:17.970
Well, things were
going pretty good.

38:17.994 --> 38:19.680
I mean, I was actually
getting pretty good

38:19.704 --> 38:21.422
at the pronunciations and stuff,

38:21.706 --> 38:24.091
like, like it's "k-vetch,"

38:24.667 --> 38:26.177
one syllable, not two,

38:26.586 --> 38:28.471
and I really like the
stories of the holidays.

38:28.629 --> 38:29.982
Hanukkah's pretty cool.

38:30.006 --> 38:31.599
I mean, eight days of presents.

38:33.259 --> 38:35.102
It's a beautiful religion

38:35.303 --> 38:37.104
and maybe I could believe in it,

38:38.598 --> 38:40.858
but then I kind of hit a snag.

38:40.975 --> 38:42.234
Oh, you did?

38:42.518 --> 38:43.944
Yeah.

38:44.228 --> 38:47.198
Well, Artie and I got to
talking about death and stuff

38:47.857 --> 38:49.367
and where people go,

38:50.359 --> 38:52.119
and Mom and Dad,
they're in heaven.

38:52.570 --> 38:54.080
I mean, I know that,

38:55.114 --> 38:56.957
but it's the heaven
they believe in, right?

38:58.951 --> 39:00.753
And that makes
sense, doesn't it?

39:01.788 --> 39:03.297
Yeah, I guess.

39:04.582 --> 39:07.728
So I got to thinking
that maybe that's why

39:07.752 --> 39:09.678
I need to believe
what they believed.

39:12.507 --> 39:14.558
So that you believe
in the same heaven?

39:15.134 --> 39:16.727
Well, yeah.

39:17.553 --> 39:20.324
I can't take the chance
that some day we might not

39:20.348 --> 39:22.483
all end up in the same place.

39:24.185 --> 39:26.529
I kind of need to know that
we'll all be together.

39:29.649 --> 39:31.075
Why did you stop?

39:31.734 --> 39:33.202
Keep going.

39:40.827 --> 39:42.211
What?

39:43.329 --> 39:44.598
Charlie, come on.

39:44.622 --> 39:45.974
Sit down.

39:45.998 --> 39:47.466
I have a surprise for you.

39:47.500 --> 39:51.095
You didn't buy me some incredibly
extravagant gift, did you?

39:52.380 --> 39:53.639
No.

39:53.673 --> 39:54.932
Hmm.

39:55.049 --> 39:56.392
Bounce up and down.

39:58.386 --> 39:59.770
What?

39:59.971 --> 40:01.355
I fixed it.

40:01.597 --> 40:03.023
No squeak.

40:03.766 --> 40:06.819
- Oh, okay.
- Which means...

40:10.189 --> 40:11.625
We can still be happy at night

40:11.649 --> 40:13.627
and wake up refreshed
in the morning.

40:13.651 --> 40:15.828
What a handy guy you are.

40:26.622 --> 40:27.798
What?

40:28.040 --> 40:29.508
Nothing.

40:34.672 --> 40:36.098
Charlie...

40:36.257 --> 40:37.609
Oh, come on.

40:37.633 --> 40:39.059
I can't.

40:39.844 --> 40:41.479
It's just a little squeak.

40:43.431 --> 40:44.899
A medium squeak.

40:45.641 --> 40:46.984
I can't.

40:48.102 --> 40:49.737
Kirsten, what are
you going to do?

40:50.104 --> 40:51.081
Tiptoe around the house,

40:51.105 --> 40:52.291
hide your toothbrush
in the bathroom,

40:52.315 --> 40:54.366
get your mail at a
post office box?

40:56.152 --> 40:57.921
So they can hear us.
So we make love.

40:57.945 --> 40:59.246
So what?

40:59.530 --> 41:00.674
You know what? You're
not invisible,

41:00.698 --> 41:04.251
and I don't want you to be, and you don't
have to be, because you belong here.

41:05.578 --> 41:08.130
Let's let everybody know
how much you belong here.

41:08.456 --> 41:10.174
What do you say? Let's
make some noise.

41:17.048 --> 41:19.767
Just don't scream "Bravo"
when we're finished.

41:24.931 --> 41:26.440
God, look at the time.

41:27.892 --> 41:29.818
They going to be
worried about you?

41:30.561 --> 41:32.071
Probably.

41:32.647 --> 41:34.031
Definitely.

41:35.858 --> 41:37.117
So...

41:37.443 --> 41:38.744
Where should we go?

41:41.197 --> 41:43.133
Where do you want to go?

41:43.157 --> 41:46.252
Um, Mexico.

41:47.119 --> 41:48.837
Why not?

41:58.673 --> 42:00.015
Tell you what.

42:00.258 --> 42:01.725
Hop in.

42:10.935 --> 42:12.278
How about...

42:12.687 --> 42:15.739
If we just drive until
we run out of gas?

42:16.190 --> 42:17.616
You got a full tank?

42:19.318 --> 42:20.786
Let's do it.

42:22.947 --> 42:24.633
So how far you think we'll get?

42:24.657 --> 42:26.208
Not a clue.

42:28.577 --> 42:30.921
Maybe someplace I've
never been before.

42:47.346 --> 42:50.409
<i>Oh, I never</i> <i>get that right.
What is my problem?</i>

42:50.433 --> 42:52.067
- <i>You're rushing it.</i>
<i>- I am?</i>

42:54.770 --> 42:56.081
<i>Was that better?</i>

42:56.105 --> 42:59.751
<i> Stop smirking. Yours
wasn't perfect either.</i>

42:59.775 --> 43:01.160
<i>Excuse me?</i>

43:05.614 --> 43:08.834
<i>Oh, I never</i> <i>get that right.
What is my problem?</i>

43:08.909 --> 43:10.836
- <i>You're rushing it.</i>
<i>- I am?</i>

43:12.955 --> 43:14.558
<i>Was that better?</i>

43:14.582 --> 43:18.103
<i> Stop smirking. Yours
wasn't perfect either.</i>

43:18.127 --> 43:19.271
<i>Excuse me?</i>

43:19.295 --> 43:21.481
<i> What? You didn't hear that?</i>

43:21.505 --> 43:24.099
<i>Your stomach was gurgling
through the adagio.</i>

43:24.133 --> 43:25.360
<i>So what?</i>

43:25.384 --> 43:26.769
<i>It sounds good as a trio.</i>

43:27.595 --> 43:30.490
<i>Stop smirking. Yours
wasn't perfect either.</i>

43:30.514 --> 43:31.450
<i>Excuse me?</i>

43:31.474 --> 43:33.660
<i> What? You didn't hear that?</i>

43:33.684 --> 43:36.538
<i>Your stomach was gurgling
through the adagio.</i>

43:36.562 --> 43:38.906
<i>So what? It sounds
good as a trio.</i>

43:45.780 --> 43:48.499
<i>Okay. All right. All
right, all right.</i>

43:50.951 --> 43:52.596
<i>All right. That's wonderful.</i>

43:52.620 --> 43:55.339
<i>That's, that's just wonderful.</i>

43:55.664 --> 43:58.717
<i>Digs the professional. I like that.
Here we go.</i>

44:00.503 --> 44:02.731
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Okay, I'm fine.</i>

44:02.755 --> 44:05.067
<i>Okay.</i>

44:05.091 --> 44:06.433
<i>And...</i>
