Park Min Ho Kidnapping Case
Part 1 

03:40.750 --> 03:43.250
Min Ho sent something. 

03:49.790 --> 03:51.900
That punk didn't even show up today. 

03:51.900 --> 03:56.310
He was here until 2 AM last night investigating. 

03:56.310 --> 03:57.610
What investigation? 

03:58.180 --> 03:59.210
I don't know. 

04:05.870 --> 04:08.890
F! That's what it was written as. 

04:48.340 --> 04:50.700
Director Yeo! 

05:06.110 --> 05:10.980
Find the real murderer of the Majang Room Salon case. 

05:15.110 --> 05:19.580
Send the result to tonight's 9 o'clock news. 

05:23.890 --> 05:29.100
If we run...
or fail to find out... 

05:31.000 --> 05:32.560
I will die. 

06:10.260 --> 06:11.520
Okay. 

06:12.380 --> 06:15.190
There was a murder last night around 1 AM in Majang. 

06:15.190 --> 06:17.920
A male and female were shot. 

06:17.920 --> 06:20.950
The video recorded on Min Ho's phone was filmed at 4:25 AM. 

06:21.980 --> 06:25.400
Min Ho left work at 2.
He didn't get home. 

06:25.400 --> 06:26.960
He got kidnapped somewhere on the way. 

06:28.520 --> 06:30.420
The handcuffs he's wearing are the ones policemen use. 

06:32.020 --> 06:36.510
Specialized handcuffs.
Only for police. 

06:37.830 --> 06:40.880
But, Min Ho's handcuffs are back at the office. 

06:40.880 --> 06:43.350
Is the kidnapper a cop? 

06:43.350 --> 06:45.340
He knows us well. 

06:45.340 --> 06:47.150
And he picked Min Ho among us. 

06:50.070 --> 06:52.000
He wasn't "picked." 

06:53.190 --> 06:56.750
If it wasn't for that F nonsense,
he would've left early. 

06:56.750 --> 06:59.240
And this wouldn't have happened. 

07:06.570 --> 07:07.740
Director Yeo. 

07:08.370 --> 07:09.750
Stop the car. 

07:23.950 --> 07:27.570
We can be easily played in a situation like this. 

07:28.210 --> 07:32.370
If we give into this bastard,
then the law becomes a joke. 

07:36.020 --> 07:37.120
Senior. 

07:37.810 --> 07:39.030
Director Yeo. 

07:40.490 --> 07:42.120
Let's focus on one thing. 

07:44.020 --> 07:45.270
This time... 

07:46.890 --> 07:48.710
We're only focusing on Min Ho. 

07:50.750 --> 07:53.690
We really need teamwork now. 

07:54.460 --> 07:56.060
At least for Min Ho. 

08:26.420 --> 08:28.020
What are you doing here? 

08:28.760 --> 08:30.340
What kind of case is it? 

08:30.340 --> 08:33.820
You guys don't need to be here.
This case is already closed. 

08:33.820 --> 08:35.400
The suspect is open. 

09:11.830 --> 09:13.490
Total of 6 bullets. 

09:14.120 --> 09:15.810
Usually 2 are empty ones. 

09:15.810 --> 09:17.900
But if the suspect put in 6 real bullets... 

09:19.050 --> 09:22.080
This wasn't an accident.
He intended to kill. 

09:27.740 --> 09:31.010
One right next to his feet.
Shot almost vertically. 

09:31.010 --> 09:32.910
The first one was a missed shot. 

09:32.910 --> 09:34.980
He was either nervous or excited. 

09:36.070 --> 09:38.770
5 random shots. 

09:39.680 --> 09:41.600
The suspect must be an amateur. 

09:43.160 --> 09:44.740
He must've shot randomly? 

09:45.950 --> 09:48.410
Both victims were fatally wounded. 

09:48.410 --> 09:49.450
One was shot in the heart. 

09:49.450 --> 09:52.780
The other was shot right next to the neck passing the artery. 

09:53.750 --> 09:55.660
That explains all this blood. 

09:59.720 --> 10:02.360
What's this?
Can you take a look at this? 

10:09.560 --> 10:12.110
This isn't a blood splash or a blood spill. 

10:12.830 --> 10:14.840
Traces of blood wiping? 

10:16.310 --> 10:18.810
Check the blood and the black stain beside it. 

10:23.220 --> 10:26.080
Director Yeo.
Let's talk for a minute. 

10:38.730 --> 10:41.210
Weren't those gunshots? 

10:41.210 --> 10:43.960
Gunshots? I didn't hear anything. 

10:46.600 --> 10:48.200
Follow him. 

10:48.200 --> 10:49.060
Yes. 

10:52.550 --> 10:53.470
Who is this? 

10:53.470 --> 10:56.680
Suspect Ji Jin Hyun.
He was filmed during our internal investigation. 

10:57.580 --> 10:59.400
Ji Jin Hyuk had an internal investigation? 

10:59.400 --> 11:01.350
Not Ji Jin Hyuk,
Lee Byung Man. 

11:02.790 --> 11:04.950
The room salon gate,
Lee Byung Man? 

11:04.950 --> 11:09.690
Ji Jin Hyuk leaked prostitute information and accepted bribery. 

11:09.690 --> 11:11.940
He had an affair with the female victim. 

11:12.480 --> 11:17.450
He must've shot them when he saw those two together. 

11:18.060 --> 11:19.940
This is going to be tough. 

11:20.590 --> 11:21.840
What other location did we miss? 

11:21.840 --> 11:23.340
Ji Jin Hyuk's house. 

11:30.880 --> 11:32.780
I'll take responsibility for this one! 

11:34.280 --> 11:35.880
What happened? 

11:35.880 --> 11:37.970
We got a report from a county sheriff. 

11:37.970 --> 11:39.510
The keys were still inside. 

11:39.510 --> 11:43.330
And the car owner was a police so we preserved the scene as is. 

11:44.610 --> 11:47.230
There isn't much traffic in this area. 

11:48.160 --> 11:50.470
And there's no cameras. 

11:51.600 --> 11:54.690
Kidnapped within 5 kilometers? 

11:55.730 --> 11:57.040
Someone stalked him. 

11:57.610 --> 11:59.570
You bastard. 

11:59.570 --> 12:02.660
He's definitely not an amateur. 

12:09.720 --> 12:12.780
There's no evidence that he was forced out. 

12:12.780 --> 12:15.050
That means he walked out on his own. 

12:15.050 --> 12:16.140
Why? 

12:24.590 --> 12:26.840
Fake accident... 

12:29.050 --> 12:30.910
The headlights are broken. 

12:31.440 --> 12:33.870
It must've been a lower car. 

12:33.870 --> 12:35.870
Where could he have gone? 

12:49.460 --> 12:53.240
Car type, year, color.
You would know, right? 

12:54.600 --> 12:57.890
You guys are pros.
Especially in hit and runs. 

12:57.890 --> 13:00.610
It's my day off.
Let me rest. 

13:00.610 --> 13:03.250
Call me as soon as you find out. 

13:04.070 --> 13:06.880
You should at least have a drink with me! 

13:08.720 --> 13:12.680
Only calls when he needs me...
What's going on? 

13:32.610 --> 13:35.210
The arrest and search happened at the same time. 

13:44.920 --> 13:47.860
Here's an escape.
Too high to jump off though. 

13:48.660 --> 13:50.450
Plus, he was barefoot. 

13:51.530 --> 13:53.280
Why is there nothing else? 

14:02.150 --> 14:03.320
Director! 

14:05.050 --> 14:06.280
Something is strange. 

14:07.580 --> 14:14.040
The investigation states that the suspect shot through the window. 

14:14.040 --> 14:16.100
But the neighbors say differently. 

14:16.100 --> 14:21.140
They heard 2 gunshots and then they heard the window shatter. 

14:32.420 --> 14:35.730
The black stain found on the cloth was a mixture of... 

14:35.730 --> 14:39.270
Wax, oil, dye, etc... 

14:39.270 --> 14:40.600
It's shoe polish. 

14:40.600 --> 14:41.830
Shoe polish? 

14:41.830 --> 14:43.080
Yes. 

14:43.080 --> 14:46.630
He must've wiped the blood stain from his shoes onto the cloth. 

14:48.460 --> 14:50.000
So it was dress shoes? 

14:54.090 --> 14:58.970
He casually wiped the blood.
Horribly aimed shots... 

14:59.840 --> 15:01.790
Something seems unnatural. 

15:03.970 --> 15:05.160
Okay. 

15:06.000 --> 15:08.210
Ji Jin Hyuk was wearing tennis shoes. 

15:09.940 --> 15:11.170
He's being framed. 

15:16.700 --> 15:18.590
Arrest is not the point for this case... 

15:20.400 --> 15:21.680
It's his tail on the line. 

15:24.170 --> 15:27.210
Lizard 

15:31.410 --> 15:34.180
Two hours between the kidnapping and filming process. 

15:34.870 --> 15:39.430
There are a total of 6 empty buildings in this 2 hour distance. 

15:42.330 --> 15:44.770
Three left, Min Ho... 

15:49.850 --> 15:52.570
Leaving your work behind is the same thing as a hit and run! 

15:52.570 --> 15:53.310
What? 

15:53.310 --> 15:55.730
Black Sonata. 

15:55.730 --> 15:58.050
There's probably hundreds of that car in Seoul. 

15:58.050 --> 16:01.220
But not that many passing from 1 AM to 4 AM last night. 

16:01.220 --> 16:02.330
Get the plate number and put it up for search. 

16:02.330 --> 16:04.450
At least tell me what happened- 

16:04.450 --> 16:08.040
Hello?
You always hang up on me! 

17:47.580 --> 17:48.990
Are you trying to cut his tail? 

17:48.990 --> 17:51.520
What kind of nonsense are you talking about? 

17:57.400 --> 18:02.920
Find the real murderer of the Majang Room Salon case. 

18:05.830 --> 18:09.590
Send the result to tonight's 9 o'clock news. 

18:09.590 --> 18:13.270
If we run...
or fail to find out... 

18:13.270 --> 18:15.110
I will die. 

18:16.510 --> 18:17.940
Okay. 

18:17.940 --> 18:19.390
What do we do now? 

18:19.390 --> 18:20.690
We have to find him. 

18:20.690 --> 18:24.620
How are we going to find him by 9 PM tonight? 

18:24.620 --> 18:26.590
I mean, the real murderer. 

18:27.410 --> 18:28.750
Real murderer? 

18:29.120 --> 18:31.650
Ji Jin Hyuk is the real murderer! 

18:32.750 --> 18:34.810
We can't release that to the press yet. 

18:35.560 --> 18:37.030
Chief. 

18:37.030 --> 18:39.670
Help us find Min Ho or stay out of it. 

18:42.030 --> 18:44.340
From now on... 

18:45.400 --> 18:47.590
I'm going to do whatever it takes. 

18:59.740 --> 19:02.550
It's certain that Ji Jin Hyuk is being falsely accused. 

19:02.550 --> 19:04.840
The crime happened at 1 AM in Majang. 

19:04.840 --> 19:07.570
And Min Ho was kidnapped roughly an hour later. 

19:07.570 --> 19:10.500
Why would that bastard move so quickly? 

19:11.300 --> 19:14.890
It's not enough to just find the real murderer. 

19:17.120 --> 19:19.370
Min Ho was put inside a trap. 

19:20.150 --> 19:22.890
We need to find out who made this trap. 

19:54.900 --> 19:56.650
Illegal phone. 

20:01.730 --> 20:03.780
We need to investigate.
Please step out. 

20:04.300 --> 20:05.780
Ah, yes. 

20:48.480 --> 20:50.960
It's the perfect place to record. 

20:50.960 --> 20:54.080
No people, no guards... 

20:54.080 --> 20:58.330
This isn't his hometown nor is it a police district. 

20:58.330 --> 21:01.670
But seeing that he came here means he knows this place well. 

21:01.670 --> 21:05.270
He's a suspicious person.
He's not stupid. 

21:06.160 --> 21:08.450
He doesn't go to places he doesn't know. 

21:13.120 --> 21:14.700
I found it! 

21:15.240 --> 21:16.350
Where?! 

21:22.400 --> 21:26.010
Are you asking me to analyze this picture? 

21:26.010 --> 21:28.500
I need accurate information as soon as possible. 

21:30.140 --> 21:32.170
Investigating an internal affair? 

21:35.050 --> 21:42.700
The result isn't that great for a crime that was prepped for a year. 

21:44.520 --> 21:45.840
1 year? 

21:45.840 --> 21:50.580
The internal investigators have been working on this for a year. 

21:50.580 --> 21:58.170
The VIP of that room salon always got away with it... 

21:58.170 --> 22:00.430
So they prepared this for a year. 

22:01.490 --> 22:05.240
In the end, that VIP's tail got chopped off. 

22:05.240 --> 22:07.090
Anyway! 

22:07.090 --> 22:10.030
Ji Jin Hyuk is a dead man. 

22:11.590 --> 22:15.220
Even if it wasn't him,
he's getting 4 terms... 

22:15.220 --> 22:19.770
He fell into the trap and now he's supposed to die. Perfect scenario ending. 

22:54.020 --> 22:54.860
This car? 

22:54.860 --> 22:55.870
Yeah! 

23:29.540 --> 23:30.840
Thank god. 

23:32.440 --> 23:36.520
Are you crazy?
We don't know where he ran off to! 

23:36.520 --> 23:39.200
They're moving together. 

23:39.200 --> 23:41.710
Thank god we have fewer options to choose from now. 

23:41.710 --> 23:44.680
But it must be hard dragging along a grown man. 

23:44.680 --> 23:46.300
He might be dead. 

23:47.900 --> 23:50.000
Do you feed a dead person water? 

23:59.750 --> 24:02.800
This bastard must've stolen another car. 

24:02.800 --> 24:04.870
Call me if someone files a missing car report. 

24:04.870 --> 24:08.910
I told you it's my day off! 

24:10.150 --> 24:12.030
Damn, I'm hungry.

24:13.840 --> 24:18.450
I don't know what's going on but don't get involved. 

24:18.450 --> 24:20.960
This is Pandora's box. 

24:59.600 --> 25:01.130
He's on the 2nd floor. 

25:08.030 --> 25:09.540
4th floor. 

25:19.380 --> 25:21.590
I think he went to the roof. 

25:58.710 --> 26:01.180
The criminal wore your type of shoe. 

26:01.950 --> 26:04.030
Wait. Wait. 

26:12.470 --> 26:13.910
Prosecutor? 

26:16.570 --> 26:19.700
Pandora 

26:33.180 --> 26:36.230
011-6310-1630 

26:36.230 --> 26:38.470
This is Lee Byung Man's number. 

26:39.060 --> 26:42.800
Ji Jin Hyuk and Lee Byung Man have known each other. 

26:43.580 --> 26:46.930
They even had a conversation yesterday using the fake phone. 

26:49.130 --> 26:52.590
What could they have been doing together? 

27:08.920 --> 27:10.890
What bring you here? 

27:15.170 --> 27:16.700
Ryu Mi Ho? 

27:17.420 --> 27:22.320
Our business got shut down because of her. 

27:22.320 --> 27:23.970
Shut down? 

27:23.970 --> 27:26.350
I found out it was temporary. 

27:27.390 --> 27:30.580
Has it been weeks now?
She ran away all of a sudden. 

27:36.380 --> 27:37.960
Pandora. 

27:41.920 --> 27:45.530
She was going to reveal Lee Byung Man's dirty deeds. 

27:45.530 --> 27:47.880
But she disappeared all of a sudden? 

27:47.880 --> 27:52.100
It seems like Lee Byung Man made her do deliveries. 

27:52.100 --> 27:57.290
She did well at first but she wanted money and ran away. 

27:57.290 --> 27:59.290
Later, she called us. 

27:59.290 --> 28:00.880
Because she was scared. 

28:02.260 --> 28:04.360
Not the police but to a prosecutor? 

28:04.360 --> 28:09.530
She knew that Lee Byung Man was affiliated with someone in the police. 

28:09.530 --> 28:10.800
And that... 

28:10.800 --> 28:12.920
Lee Byung Man killed somebody. 

28:13.700 --> 28:15.040
Very neatly. 

28:25.460 --> 28:27.910
There are a lot of new apartments. 

28:27.910 --> 28:29.330
How do you like it here? 

28:29.330 --> 28:34.890
There are a lot of markets and it's close to Seoul. 

28:36.730 --> 28:39.840
The kidnapper needs a place to hide where no one can see. 

28:39.840 --> 28:42.500
He needs to run away eventually so he must know this place well. 

28:42.500 --> 28:47.220
A place from his childhood,
where there is no connection. 

28:49.660 --> 28:51.240
Very good. 

28:56.660 --> 28:58.390
What size are you looking for? 

28:58.390 --> 28:59.730
Are you living by yourself? 

28:59.730 --> 29:02.390
It doesn't matter if I live alone or not. 

29:03.260 --> 29:04.920
Not an apartment... 

29:06.390 --> 29:07.910
A market. 

29:10.480 --> 29:12.490
Somewhere with no cameras. 

29:33.960 --> 29:35.890
Who is it? 

29:38.290 --> 29:39.630
I'm with the police. 

29:39.630 --> 29:43.260
Excuse me but is this where Mi Ho lives? 

29:43.260 --> 29:45.030
Did you find her? 

29:54.660 --> 29:59.170
When you're a social worker,
you see lots of kids like Mi Ho. 

29:59.170 --> 30:03.890
Kids who are smart but turn bad due to lack of family support. 

30:05.420 --> 30:10.890
Isn't it crazy that they still underage girls like her? 

30:12.640 --> 30:15.580
How long has it been since she left the house? 

30:15.580 --> 30:17.880
I think it's been a week now. 

30:17.880 --> 30:19.880
After the Detective took her. 

30:21.680 --> 30:23.110
Detective? 

30:25.530 --> 30:29.180
A Detective came to get Mi Ho? 

30:29.180 --> 30:30.370
Yes. 

30:41.010 --> 30:42.120
Yes? 

30:42.120 --> 30:44.650
There was a witness for Lee Byung Man.

30:44.650 --> 30:46.090
She's a young student. 

30:46.090 --> 30:47.630
Ryu Mi Ho. 

30:47.630 --> 30:51.570
10 days ago, Lee Byeong Man sent a picture to Ji Jin Hyuk to find her. 

30:51.570 --> 30:55.520
Then a week later, Ji Jin Hyuk took her from her house. 

30:55.520 --> 30:58.180
That's where it ends. 

30:58.180 --> 31:01.750
Pandora was trying to open the box and that's when it started. 

31:01.750 --> 31:04.040
If Ji Jin Hyuk got rid of the witness, Ryu Mi Ho... 

31:04.040 --> 31:06.510
He's not the tail, he's the body. 

31:06.510 --> 31:09.680
The next target after Lee Byung Man. 

31:09.680 --> 31:12.910
If we know what's inside Pandora's Box... 

31:12.910 --> 31:16.450
Then we can find out who purposefully closed it as well. 

31:25.140 --> 31:28.210
Ma'am! Give me some cold water! 

31:29.250 --> 31:31.130
We don't have cold water. 

31:37.020 --> 31:39.220
I had cold ones but someone just bought them all. 

31:39.220 --> 31:40.350
All? 

31:41.380 --> 31:42.920
A young man? 

31:42.920 --> 31:44.000
Yes. 

31:47.540 --> 31:50.920
That's him! He was just here! 

31:52.020 --> 31:53.660
Where did he go? 

31:53.660 --> 31:58.310
He drove off asking where Incheon was. 

31:58.310 --> 31:59.650
Incheon? 

32:17.410 --> 32:18.720
What happened? 

32:19.550 --> 32:21.620
We're still checking the cameras. 

32:29.060 --> 32:32.020
It hasn't even been 30 minutes.
Why are you looking at 40-50 minutes ago? 

32:32.020 --> 32:35.220
We checked twice but we couldn't find anything so we went back. 

32:36.110 --> 32:37.900
That can't be... 

32:37.900 --> 32:41.060
From that store to here is only 5 minutes, 10 minutes maximum. 

32:49.530 --> 32:51.030
This bastard. 

32:52.990 --> 32:56.710
What's on the opposite direction? 

32:56.710 --> 32:58.490
It's the way back to Seoul. 

33:01.930 --> 33:03.590
He's still here. 

33:04.240 --> 33:04.990
Keep looking. 

33:04.990 --> 33:05.800
Yes! 

33:41.650 --> 33:42.680
How is it? 

33:44.370 --> 33:45.950
This time it's a hotel. 

33:47.550 --> 33:49.670
I thought of you. 

33:50.700 --> 33:54.300
Can you ask room service to get me some medicine? 

33:55.590 --> 33:58.640
You haven't lost it yet.
Making jokes in this situation. 

34:00.720 --> 34:01.990
I'm serious. 

34:04.200 --> 34:07.850
I have no intention of killing you. 

34:08.739 --> 34:14.340
If your team moves quickly,
you should be able to go home tonight. 

34:15.889 --> 34:20.020
Those guys can't do it without me. 

34:23.639 --> 34:25.989
I don't know why you're doing this... 

34:27.360 --> 34:28.960
But we can help you. 

34:29.670 --> 34:33.219
The fact that I'm your target means that you trust our team. 

34:36.780 --> 34:39.639
Look at this kid talking nonsense. 

34:41.150 --> 34:44.000
Can't you see the mask on my face? 

34:44.889 --> 34:46.679
This mask from society? 

34:48.280 --> 34:50.010
Put your head down. 

34:53.500 --> 34:56.199
Chameleon 

35:02.970 --> 35:05.390
Hyung, the missing car report came in. 

35:05.390 --> 35:09.710
Old black Grandeur.
Number: 02-318 

35:09.710 --> 35:11.310
02-318. 

35:11.940 --> 35:13.220
Did you hear me? 

35:25.500 --> 35:26.900
Where is the Chief? 

35:26.900 --> 35:28.530
I'm not sure. 

35:28.530 --> 35:31.440
Is he in a meeting? 

35:32.220 --> 35:33.930
I'm not sure. 

35:52.830 --> 35:57.070
Wait! I'm not here for you!
I'm here for Mi ho! 

36:02.250 --> 36:03.810
It's all my fault. 

36:04.850 --> 36:07.640
I introduced her to that place. 

36:07.640 --> 36:11.030
You were the last person she sent a text message to. 

36:11.030 --> 36:12.740
What did she say? 

36:16.440 --> 36:17.690
This. 

36:23.290 --> 36:24.570
The annoying one? 

36:25.650 --> 36:27.990
Who is she telling you to call? 

36:27.990 --> 36:30.390
There's someone who used to always scold us. 

36:30.390 --> 36:33.970
Always told us to graduate,
not to blame our parents. 

36:33.970 --> 36:38.600
He bought us food and told us to call him when we're in trouble. 

36:39.530 --> 36:44.920
Mi Ho said that she found a way to live after stealing that money. 

36:44.920 --> 36:46.950
But, she was still scared. 

36:49.240 --> 36:54.390
I didn't call him because I didn't want him to worry. 

36:54.390 --> 36:57.370
Mi Ho knew something was coming. 

36:59.270 --> 37:02.450
Was this person someone who could've helped? 

37:02.450 --> 37:03.710
Probably... 

37:04.640 --> 37:05.830
He's a Detective. 

37:08.500 --> 37:09.950
Detective? 

37:09.950 --> 37:10.970
Yes. 

37:12.100 --> 37:14.000
What's his name? 

37:19.560 --> 37:20.630
Here. 

37:41.000 --> 37:43.750
Isn't that it?
Black 3218? 

37:44.200 --> 37:45.370
Don't point. 

37:46.240 --> 37:47.860
He could be looking somewhere else. 

38:16.340 --> 38:17.960
He's trying to fool me. 

38:30.560 --> 38:31.860
Min Ho? 

38:35.710 --> 38:36.490
Park Min Ho? 

38:50.500 --> 38:53.350
What room is that black car staying in? 

38:53.350 --> 38:54.690
Grandeur? 

38:55.540 --> 38:57.700
It's Room 302. 

39:02.560 --> 39:03.790
What's this? 

39:25.180 --> 39:27.710
What the hell do you think you're doing? 

39:27.710 --> 39:30.430
The suspect has a gun... 

39:30.430 --> 39:34.980
Since when did we start shooting?
When?! 

39:37.200 --> 39:39.770
Let's talk this over, okay? 

39:40.900 --> 39:42.970
What station are you guys from? 

39:42.970 --> 39:44.230
Internal Investigations. 

39:45.220 --> 39:48.160
He left this place clean... 

39:52.360 --> 39:56.530
He didn't clean, he just didn't come in... 

39:57.680 --> 40:01.120
This means he knew we were after him, you fools... 

40:11.130 --> 40:17.120
Well, kids who are fools become policemen. 

43:10.010 --> 43:11.650
Don't blame me. 

44:07.960 --> 44:10.680
He wants us to still chase after him. 

44:12.300 --> 44:15.440
He still has a reason to not kill Min Ho. For sure. 

44:16.470 --> 44:18.740
We have to get some time. 

44:18.740 --> 44:20.930
Ji Jin Hyuk is not the murderer. 

44:22.750 --> 44:25.120
He is affiliated with this case... 

44:25.950 --> 44:27.680
...but he is not the killer. 

44:29.510 --> 44:33.730
This is all they came up with for a year. 

44:34.470 --> 44:39.680
It's worse than your work in half a day. Stupid people. 

44:43.180 --> 44:45.300
Did you meet the prosecutors? 

44:45.300 --> 44:49.450
They were on a race with Lee Byung Man's case. 

44:50.730 --> 44:54.490
Dead or alive, we started this mess... 

44:54.490 --> 44:56.690
...so we have to clean it up. 

44:57.930 --> 45:00.720
Didn't you say to help or step aside? 

45:02.100 --> 45:04.820
I'll back off but help me out. 

45:05.320 --> 45:07.660
Find him before the prosecutors. 

45:08.890 --> 45:12.450
More investigation is needed until I can find him. 

45:13.750 --> 45:16.300
We need to get the press release as soon as possible. 

45:16.300 --> 45:19.720
Fine. What are we doing with the criminal? 

45:20.350 --> 45:21.690
We need to make one up. 

45:23.760 --> 45:25.910
Let's make one. 

45:38.030 --> 45:42.270
The moon empties everything to become full once again. 

45:42.270 --> 45:44.720
After the waning moon,
it becomes the end of the month. 

45:46.730 --> 45:49.490
I'm also going to put everything on the line this time. 

45:57.110 --> 45:58.940
Am I still in danger? 

45:59.760 --> 46:01.600
It's over now. 

46:01.600 --> 46:05.130
We got a confession that someone blamed you for everything. 

46:05.130 --> 46:08.240
There'll be a major investigation for all the corruptions. 

46:08.240 --> 46:09.730
What about me? 

46:09.730 --> 46:12.930
You won't be on the list. 

46:12.930 --> 46:14.840
Let's meet. 

46:14.840 --> 46:16.240
I'll take responsibility. 

46:17.260 --> 46:19.250
I don't trust anyone. 

46:19.250 --> 46:22.080
You guys come here and... 

46:22.080 --> 46:25.470
If something happens to me then it'll really get crazy. 

46:26.420 --> 46:28.780
Come to the place where Min Ho was kidnapped. 

46:29.950 --> 46:33.390
Show up after the 9 o'clock news. 

46:33.390 --> 46:35.230
We'll trade after the news. 

46:35.920 --> 46:37.540
If you don't come... 

46:38.820 --> 46:40.820
Then it won't get crazy... 

46:40.820 --> 46:42.380
It'll be the end. 

47:18.860 --> 47:23.310
Ma Suk Gi, 24 years of service.
International Investigation Team. 

47:24.390 --> 47:26.300
Those two know each other. 

47:26.300 --> 47:28.260
There must be a connection with the room salon and Mi Ho. 

47:28.260 --> 47:32.070
He was the one filming on the night of the crime. 

47:32.070 --> 47:35.360
And he was also the one with the gun at the motel. 

47:43.920 --> 47:46.280
Weren't those gunshots? 

47:46.430 --> 47:49.040
Gunshots? I didn't hear anything. 

47:50.170 --> 47:53.220
He was the one fooling around with the gun at the motel? 

47:53.220 --> 47:56.180
Since when did we start shooting?
When!? 

47:58.320 --> 48:00.830
Let's talk this over, okay? 

48:01.690 --> 48:06.250
We still haven't located him yet. 

48:06.250 --> 48:07.440
Okay. 

48:12.700 --> 48:14.100
Director Yeo. 

49:00.220 --> 49:01.890
First news. 

49:01.890 --> 49:08.050
The suspect for the crime that took place in a hostess bar yesterday is now arrested. 

49:10.190 --> 49:16.160
The suspect is now under arrest for the shooting yesterday. 

49:16.160 --> 49:21.720
Mr. Lee and Ms. Yang who grew a significant number of these businesses... 

49:21.720 --> 49:24.680
...has been shot for unknown reasons. 

49:24.680 --> 49:30.430
It is stated that he is currently being questioned for the purpose behind killing. 

49:30.430 --> 49:34.860
The police cannot release any information during the investigation... 

49:34.860 --> 49:39.040
...therefore they are trying their best. 

49:39.040 --> 49:45.000
There is a high chance that the arrested suspect is a former police officer. 

49:45.000 --> 49:48.270
This is Yoon Jung Hee from YCN News. 

50:13.870 --> 50:15.280
Where is Park Min Ho? 

50:17.050 --> 50:22.020
I'm sorry but I don't even trust my own mom. 

50:22.020 --> 50:23.770
So how can I trust you guys? 

50:25.260 --> 50:28.550
I put him somewhere safe, so don't worry. 

50:28.550 --> 50:30.550
Let me have some type of insurance. 

50:31.880 --> 50:39.790
If something happens to me you know he's dead, right? 

50:41.780 --> 50:43.450
Let's get in the car. 

50:43.450 --> 50:45.630
We'll send someone over to get Park Min Ho. 

50:54.520 --> 50:56.490
What is this? 

50:56.490 --> 50:57.830
What's going on? 

50:57.830 --> 51:00.790
Stand still! 

51:03.640 --> 51:06.110
What the hell? 

52:12.230 --> 52:13.770
What's up with him? 

52:17.380 --> 52:18.960
He's not talking... 

52:25.230 --> 52:26.550
Director Yeo... 

52:27.690 --> 52:30.520
I think Min Ho's in danger. 

52:31.620 --> 52:33.850
What's going to happen to him? 

52:43.520 --> 52:45.070
What happened? 

55:07.350 --> 55:08.580
Dad... 

55:10.070 --> 55:12.600
Please come out of that hell now, Dad... 

55:14.610 --> 55:17.290
I'm not going to die there like that... 

55:18.770 --> 55:20.930
I'm never going to die like that... 

56:08.040 --> 56:09.250
What? 

56:11.830 --> 56:17.080
Why is he... alone? 

56:19.460 --> 56:23.200
2 hours ago, there was a shooting incident. 

56:24.470 --> 56:26.510
They heard ammunitions... 

56:28.740 --> 56:32.260
It's the same neighborhood as the cameras. 

56:33.170 --> 56:34.340
And... 

56:36.760 --> 56:45.970
There were 2 reports of a gunshot in the Ya San area. 

57:25.040 --> 57:36.390
Subtitles by CJ Entertainment 

57:36.390 --> 57:39.440
Find the real murderer of the Majang Room Salon case. 

57:39.440 --> 57:44.280
If we run...
or fail to find out... 

57:44.280 --> 57:45.580
I will die. 

57:45.580 --> 57:46.990
Director Yeo. 

57:48.310 --> 57:50.360
Let's focus on one thing. 

57:50.900 --> 57:52.150
This time... 

57:53.710 --> 57:55.760
Let's only focus on Min Ho. 

57:57.110 --> 58:01.670
Since when did we start shooting?
When!? 

58:02.380 --> 58:04.280
Let go of me and let's talk. 

58:04.280 --> 58:06.400
Help us find Min Ho or stay out of it. 

58:06.400 --> 58:11.070
From now on,
I'm going to do whatever it takes.
