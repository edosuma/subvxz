{\an8}SHE GOES,
"I DON'T BELIEVE RON,

YOU WROTE IN THE LETTER.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.578
{\an8}WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA DO NEXT?

08:15.661 --> 08:17.580
{\an8}THE GIRL'S GONNA GET BACK
WITH HIM NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO--

08:17.663 --> 08:18.915
{\an8}- I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT,

08:18.998 --> 08:21.292
{\an8}BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HER [bleep] PROBLEM IS.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.253
{\an8}- ARE THEY?
- YEAH.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.671
{\an8}- TELL ME.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.298
{\an8}- WHEN IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME,

08:27.381 --> 08:28.549
{\an8}I THINK IT'S HILARIOUS.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.009
{\an8}I'LL JUST BE THE BYSTANDER,
PLAYING AROUND.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.219
{\an8}I'LL BE FLIPPIN' PANCAKES

08:31.302 --> 08:33.095
{\an8}WHILE PEOPLE ARE
PUNCHING THEMSELVES IN THE FACE.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.972
{\an8}SHE SAID SOMETHING LIKE
THEY'RE TRYING TO START A FIGHT

08:36.057 --> 08:37.265
{\an8}OVER YOU OR SOMETHING.
- I LOVE IT.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.311
{\an8}I CAN GIVE
TWO [bleep] RIGHT NOW.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.687
{\an8}- I WANNA TELL HER.
I WANNA TELL HER.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.272
{\an8}- IF YOU FEEL THIS STRONGLY
ABOUT IT,

08:43.356 --> 08:45.524
{\an8}LIKE TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN
SEE YOUR ADRENALINE'S GOING,

08:45.608 --> 08:47.235
{\an8}THEN TALK TO HER.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.820
{\an8}ANGELINA,
CAN YOU BRING HER OUT HERE?

08:53.032 --> 08:56.577
{\an8}SAM, COME OUTSIDE.
THEY WANNA TALK TO YOU.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.996
{\an8}THE TWO GIRLS.
COME.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.957
{\an8}- DID THEY JUST
SEND YOU IN HERE?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.458
{\an8}- YEAH.
- THEY WANNA COME TALK TO ME,

09:02.541 --> 09:03.876
{\an8}THEY CAN COME TALK TO ME.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.211
{\an8}I'M YOUR ROOMMATE--
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE

09:05.294 --> 09:06.379
{\an8}TO TALK TO ME
AS A REAL PERSON.

09:06.462 --> 09:08.464
{\an8}YOU DON'T SEND ANGELINA
IN TO GET ME.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.008
{\an8}- SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO GO INSIDE.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.718
{\an8}SHE DOESN'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH YOU GUYS.

09:12.802 --> 09:13.761
{\an8}- WHY WON'T SHE COME OUT HERE?
- SHE'S SITTING ON THE COUCH.

09:13.844 --> 09:15.846
{\an8}SHE DOESN'T FEEL GOOD.
- AT THIS POINT,

09:15.930 --> 09:17.890
{\an8}SHE'S LUCKY I DON'T GO IN THERE
AND BACKHAND HER

09:17.974 --> 09:19.558
{\an8}WHEN SHE'S SITTING
ON THE [bleep] COUCH.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.185
{\an8}- STOP IT. I WON'T LET YOU.
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE HERE

09:21.269 --> 09:22.645
{\an8}THAT WANTS TO TELL HER
ABOUT THE LETTER.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.648
{\an8}- 'CAUSE I'M A [bleep]
GOOD FRIEND, ANGELINA.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.067
{\an8}- WHY DON'T YOU GO ASK HER
TO [bleep] COME OUTSIDE?

09:28.150 --> 09:29.193
{\an8}- I PRETTY MUCH WALK AWAY

09:29.277 --> 09:30.820
{\an8}BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH
PISSING ME OFF.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.572
{\an8}JEN, YOU'RE [bleep] RETARDED
FOR AGREEING WITH ANGELINA,

09:33.656 --> 09:35.616
{\an8}AND ANGELINA, SHUT THE [bleep]
UP, BECAUSE WHO ARE YOU?

09:36.701 --> 09:40.246
{\an8}- WHAT'D YOU JUST SAY?
- NOT YOU, SAM.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.623
{\an8}- THAT'S [bleep] UP,

09:42.707 --> 09:44.458
{\an8}YOU CAN'T EVEN GIVE US
FIVE SECOND OF YOUR TIME.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.794
{\an8}- DON'T SEND ANGELINA IN HERE
TO GET INVOLVED IN ANYTHING.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.671
{\an8}- "A"--WATCH YOUR [bleep] TONE,

09:48.754 --> 09:51.382
{\an8}AND "B", IT WASN'T [bleep] ME.

09:51.465 --> 09:52.842
{\an8}SO DO YOU WANNA
GET YOUR [bleep]--

09:52.925 --> 09:54.468
{\an8}YOU WANNA GET REALLY [bleep]?
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

09:54.552 --> 09:57.430
{\an8}I'M DOING IT
FOR THAT [bleep] GIRL.

09:57.513 --> 10:00.099
{\an8}SHE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU--
- SHE CAN TALK TO ME!

10:00.182 --> 10:02.768
{\an8}- AS A FRIEND, YOU SHOULD BE
ABLE TO [bleep] TALK TO HER.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.603
{\an8}- REALLY? AS A FRIEND, SHE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALK TO ME.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.522
{\an8}- [bleep] YOU.
- [bleep] YOU.

10:06.605 --> 10:09.358
{\an8}- BECAUSE YOU'RE A NAIVE BEAST,
A NAIVE BITCH

10:09.442 --> 10:14.322
{\an8}WHILE YOUR MAN'S PUTTING
HIS [...] IN OTHER [...].

10:14.405 --> 10:17.533
{\an8}- YOU SHOULD HAVE [bleep]
TOLD ME YOU KNEW SOMETHING

10:17.616 --> 10:18.534
{\an8}AS A FRIEND!
- WE ALL DID!

10:18.617 --> 10:20.995
{\an8}[overlapping shouting]

10:21.078 --> 10:22.204
{\an8}DID YOUR OLD MAN TELL YOU?

10:22.288 --> 10:24.665
{\an8}[overlapping yelling]

10:24.749 --> 10:26.125
{\an8}- I'M NOT CLOSE TO THEM!

10:26.208 --> 10:27.460
{\an8}YOU TWO ARE THE CLOSEST ONES
IN HERE,

10:27.543 --> 10:29.920
{\an8}AND YOU DIDN'T [bleep]
SAY A WORD TO ME, AND YOU KNEW.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.047
{\an8}- I WASN'T THERE!

10:31.130 --> 10:32.548
{\an8}- WHAT THE [bleep]
DOES IT MATTER?

10:32.631 --> 10:35.176
{\an8}I WAS [bleep] SINGLE.
I WAS [bleep] SINGLE.

10:35.259 --> 10:38.054
{\an8}- MY GIRLFRIEND
IS MY [bleep] FACE...

10:38.137 --> 10:40.431
{\an8}- AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
YOUR [bleep] FRIEND TOO, RIGHT?

10:40.514 --> 10:41.849
{\an8}- IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
TELL ME,

10:41.932 --> 10:43.768
{\an8}OR I'LL DEAD YOU
AS A FRIEND.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.936
{\an8}- ALL I CAN SAY
THIS IS MY BUSINESS RIGHT NOW.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.730
{\an8}WHOEVER WROTE ME THE NOTE,
THANK YOU.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.982
{\an8}I APPRECIATE IT, 'CAUSE I LOOK
LIKE A [bleep] IDIOT.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.942
{\an8}- SO SOMEONE MAN UP AND SAY
WHO WROTE THE [bleep] NOTE.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.819
{\an8}- HOLD ON A SECOND.
IF SOMEBODY HERE DID IT,

10:53.903 --> 10:55.321
{\an8}JUST SAY IT NOW--
WHO DID IT?

10:55.404 --> 10:56.572
{\an8}WHO DID IT?

10:56.655 --> 10:59.408
{\an8}WHO [bleep] DID IT?
JUST OPEN UP YOUR MOUTH.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.368
{\an8}IT'S OUT THERE.
I DON'T CARE.

11:00.451 --> 11:01.744
{\an8}APPRECIATE THE PERSON
WHO DID IT.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.412
{\an8}WHO DID IT?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.164
{\an8}NONE OF YOU GUYS
CAN OPEN UP YOUR MOUTH?

11:05.247 --> 11:08.250
{\an8}WHY CAN'T YOU JUST MAN UP
AND SAY YOU WROTE THE NOTE?

11:08.334 --> 11:09.627
{\an8}WHAT ARE YOU,
A LITTLE BITCH?

11:09.710 --> 11:11.796
{\an8}LIKE YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY?
WHAT ARE YOU SCARED OF?

11:11.879 --> 11:13.422
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME SICK,
BECAUSE SOMEBODY WROTE THAT NOTE

11:13.506 --> 11:14.882
{\an8}AND NOBODY CAN
OPEN UP THEIR MOUTH.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.425
{\an8}I'M PRETTY SURE
IT WASN'T THE GUYS.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.635
{\an8}- I DIDN'T WRITE IT.
- EVERYBODY KNOWS IT WASN'T ME.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.637
{\an8}- IF THE GUYS SAW SAM
DO SOMETHING,

11:19.720 --> 11:21.847
{\an8}LIKE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.265
{\an8}AND JUST FOR THE SIMPLE FACT
THAT WE TOLD HER,

11:23.349 --> 11:25.101
{\an8}TO LIKE [...] BE CAREFUL
WITH HERSELF--

11:25.184 --> 11:26.435
{\an8}- ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW
YOU GUYS WANNA

11:26.519 --> 11:27.937
{\an8}OPEN UP YOUR [bleep] MOUTH?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.647
{\an8}IF YOU GUYS WERE REAL FRIENDS,

11:29.730 --> 11:31.107
{\an8}YOU WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING
THAT [bleep] NIGHT

11:31.190 --> 11:32.775
{\an8}AND NOT WAITED A WEEK
AND WROTE A [bleep] NOTE,

11:32.858 --> 11:34.068
{\an8}BOTTOM LINE.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.194
{\an8}- SO THERE YOU GO,
BOTTOM LINE, I WASN'T THERE.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.987
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE [bleep] HAPPENED.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.573
{\an8}- I WAS SINGLE, SO IT'S NONE
YOUR [bleep] BUSINESS.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.493
{\an8}- IF YOU WERE SINGLE,
KEEP IT IN, BUT BE CAREFUL.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.620
{\an8}I SAID [bleep] BE CAREFUL!

11:44.703 --> 11:47.790
{\an8}- ALL I KNOW IS
A LOT OF [bleep] HAPPENED TO ME,

11:47.873 --> 11:49.500
{\an8}AND IT'S EMBARRASSING.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.336
{\an8}AND THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.677
{\an8}I REALLY DON'T TRUST ANYBODY.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.013
{\an8}I'M ON MY OWN, AND I HAVE TO
GO THROUGH THIS ON MY OWN.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.311
{\an8}- MIND THEIR [bleep] BUSINESS
JUST LIKE I [bleep] DID.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.981
{\an8}[telephone rings]

12:12.064 --> 12:12.773
{\an8}SAM.
- I'M OKAY.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.818
{\an8}I JUST NEED TO--LIKE A MINUTE.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.362
{\an8}- SURE?
- YEAH.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.655
{\an8}- YOU SURE?
- YEAH. I PROMISE.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.157
{\an8}- I'LL SIT OUT HERE
AND WAIT FOR YOU.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.950
{\an8}- NO, IT'S OKAY.
I PROMISE, I'M OKAY.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.039
{\an8}- TOLD YOU THIS WAS
A BAD IDEA.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.917
{\an8}SUCH [bleep].
TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE.

12:32.001 --> 12:32.960
{\an8}WE [bleep] UP.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.171
{\an8}WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE
GIVEN THAT LETTER,

12:35.254 --> 12:36.922
{\an8}BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
SHE DOESN'T APPRECIATE IT.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.757
{\an8}MY GOD, YOU TRY TO BE NICE
TO SOMEBODY,

12:38.841 --> 12:40.509
{\an8}AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE
GETS MAD.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.429
{\an8}I'M JUST--I'M SORRY I DID THIS.

12:43.512 --> 12:46.390
{\an8}IF YOU REALLY LOVE SOMEBODY,
YOU GOTTA SAY IT.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.392
{\an8}- YEP.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.441
{\an8}- YOU BOTH NEED TO UNDERSTAND
ONE THING.

12:55.524 --> 12:58.360
{\an8}I'M ON MY OWN, AND I'M KIND OF
IN A MIX OF EMOTIONS,

12:58.444 --> 13:00.321
{\an8}AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT
MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

13:00.404 --> 13:03.157
{\an8}SO I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN
COMING TO YOU WITH MY PROBLEMS,

13:03.240 --> 13:05.409
{\an8}BECAUSE I'VE KIND OF JUST BEEN
A BALL OF JUST A MESS.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.827
{\an8}A LEGIT MESS.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.537
{\an8}SO I'M TRYING TO BE STRONG
ON MY OWN.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.372
{\an8}- WELL, WE SAID WE WANNA
JUST TALK TO YOU

13:10.456 --> 13:12.708
{\an8}'CAUSE WE THINK THAT
YOU'RE UPSET WITH US.

13:12.791 --> 13:13.709
{\an8}- TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

13:13.792 --> 13:15.669
{\an8}THIS LETTER
HAS REALLY DESTROYED ME,

13:15.753 --> 13:18.047
{\an8}AND EVERYTHING'S REALLY MENTALLY
AND PHYSICALLY DESTROYED ME.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.673
{\an8}NOBODY'LL EVER UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

13:19.757 --> 13:22.051
{\an8}I'M NOT MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.428
{\an8}AND I FEEL BETRAYED
BY EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE

13:24.512 --> 13:26.388
{\an8}BECAUSE NOBODY'S STILL
MANNING UP TO THAT NOTE,

13:26.472 --> 13:28.224
{\an8}AND I ALWAYS FELT
CLOSER TO YOU TWO

13:28.307 --> 13:30.309
{\an8}THAN ANYBODY IN THIS HOUSE.

13:30.392 --> 13:31.602
{\an8}HONESTLY, EVERYBODY IN THIS
HOUSE PLAYED GAMES WITH ME.

13:31.685 --> 13:34.355
{\an8}AND I'M NOT OKAY RIGHT NOW.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.403
{\an8}- IT GOT GANGSTER TONIGHT
OUTTA NOWHERE.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.739

ON SAMMI--

13:43.822 --> 13:45.407

14:04.468 --> 14:06.011
{\an8}- THIS WHOLE THING'S

14:06.095 --> 14:07.846
{\an8}- I UNDERSTAND THAT.

{\an8}- I'M--I LOOK LIKE
AN IDIOT AND A FOOL.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.767
{\an8}- IT'S NONE OF THEIR
[bleep] BUSINESS.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.769
{\an8}WE GOT OVER THAT HUMP.

14:13.852 --> 14:16.313
{\an8}YOU GOT A LETTER.
THEY TOLD YOU ALL THIS [bleep].

14:16.397 --> 14:17.773
{\an8}BUT OBVIOUSLY,
WE'RE STRONGER THAN THAT,

14:17.856 --> 14:18.941
{\an8}AND WE GOT THROUGH IT.

14:19.024 --> 14:22.027
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE
THE [bleep] YOU PUT ME THROUGH

14:22.111 --> 14:23.779
{\an8}HAS BEEN A LOT.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.996
{\an8}- I'M SHADY?
- LIKE...

14:41.630 --> 14:42.464
{\an8}- IF YOU WANT YOUR SPACE,
I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.633
{\an8}NOT GONNA DEAL WITH ME.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.843

YOUR SPACE

{\an8}'CAUSE YOU NEED TO...
YOU KNOW?

14:46.594 --> 14:48.846
{\an8}AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.889
{\an8}ONLY THING I COULD DO
WAS GIVE HER HER SPACE

14:50.973 --> 14:54.560
{\an8}AND HOPE TIME WILL BRING US
BACK TOGETHER.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.658
{\an8}- OPTOMETRY?
THERE'S A PAIN IN MY EYE.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.327
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.286
{\an8}- COME ALL THE WAY FORWARD.

15:12.369 --> 15:13.829
{\an8}- HE ALSO HAS A HISTORY
OF PINKEYE.

15:13.912 --> 15:15.956
{\an8}I JUST WANTED
TO THROW THAT OUT THERE.

15:16.040 --> 15:16.790
{\an8}- DID THEY EVER FIND OUT THAT
YOU AND NICOLE WERE THE ONES

15:16.874 --> 15:18.417
{\an8}THAT WROTE THAT LETTER?
- NO.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.669
{\an8}- TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.588
{\an8}JUST TELL ME.
COME ON, YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

15:25.924 --> 15:26.508
{\an8}- OPTOMETRY?
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.219
{\an8}I WAS CONFIRMING IT.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.055
{\an8}- HOLD ON, LET ME DIAGNOSE IT
RIGHT NOW, HOLD ON.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.556
{\an8}- GET OUTTA HERE.
- COME ON, COME ON.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.099
{\an8}I'M SCHOOLED IN THIS.
LET ME SEE.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.185
{\an8}- THERE'S A PAIN IN MY EYE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.395
{\an8}BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
I HAVE SAND IN MY EYE.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.230
{\an8}I GOTTA MAKE A DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT

15:40.314 --> 15:41.607
{\an8}AND RIGHT AWAY,

15:41.690 --> 15:43.359
{\an8}I'M REMINISCING ABOUT
GETTING PINKEYE IN NEW JERSEY.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.778
{\an8}YO, GUYS, I GOTTA
LET YOU KNOW SOMETHING...

15:45.861 --> 15:47.488
{\an8}DISGUSTING.

15:47.571 --> 15:50.240
