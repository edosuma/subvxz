WEBVTT

00:10.340 --> 00:11.580
Answer the phone.

00:12.050 --> 00:13.927
This is Wendy. Leave a message.

00:14.010 --> 00:15.716
--They put up a cross.

00:19.390 --> 00:22.132
They put up a cross. Jesus fuck...

00:25.150 --> 00:26.549
I'm going to the Youngs'.

00:31.030 --> 00:33.942
-If you are satisfied with your message--
-Shut the fuck up.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.306
Hi.

01:03.430 --> 01:06.593
-Yeah. I know it. I know it. I know it.
-They put up a cross, Mr. Byrde.

01:06.690 --> 01:10.319
-We told you, not a single nail.
-Yeah. I heard every word.

01:10.400 --> 01:14.188
I'm gonna take the cross down.
I'm gonna keep him on the water. Okay?

01:14.280 --> 01:16.521
-Hey, there. How's it going?
-Hi.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.317
Um, how you doing, pastor?
You know the Snells?

01:19.410 --> 01:21.401
Of course. Jacob, Darlene. How's it going?

01:21.490 --> 01:24.948
You know, I was, uh...
I told the Snells that, um, you know...

01:25.040 --> 01:27.452
I'm building you that church
because, um...

01:28.460 --> 01:31.202
- You know, 'cause I invest. And, um...
- Mm-hmm.

01:31.290 --> 01:36.000
And I told them that I would also invest
a very generous sum, um...

01:37.300 --> 01:38.710
into their farm.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.799
And so, just like anyone, they wanted
to talk to a reliable reference.

01:44.220 --> 01:46.552
Well, uh, Marty's been nothing
but a man of his word.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.016
-Oh, thank you.
-Thus far.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.761
Thank you.
We'll get the permits worked out.

01:49.850 --> 01:51.477
-Hey, Grace.
-Hi.

01:51.560 --> 01:53.221
Honey...

01:53.320 --> 01:54.560
What are you doing?

01:55.650 --> 02:00.440
-You should be in bed with your feet up.
-Oh, I'm all right, thank you.

02:00.530 --> 02:01.986
What, uh... What's going on?

02:02.080 --> 02:04.787
The Snells are thinking about
getting into business with Marty here.

02:05.330 --> 02:09.414
How much you planning
on investing in our little homestead?

02:10.040 --> 02:12.873
How much? Boy, I don't know. It's, uh...

02:14.750 --> 02:17.469
You got a...
You got an agricultural business

02:17.550 --> 02:21.714
that's looking for reliable distribution,

02:21.800 --> 02:24.633
-sustain you all year long.
-Mm-hmm.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.517
I'm thinking $100,000.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.727
I don't think that'd be worth your while.

02:38.450 --> 02:42.864
Why don't we leave the Youngs for now
and go negotiate?

02:48.500 --> 02:50.240
Thank you for your reference, pastor.

02:51.580 --> 02:53.741
Darlene, would you mind taking the truck?

02:54.840 --> 02:56.296
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

02:58.300 --> 02:59.961
-This gets done now.
-Mm-hmm.

03:01.970 --> 03:02.959
Great.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.806
Y'all have a nice day.

03:08.270 --> 03:09.089
Good day.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.488
You understand punitive interest,
don't you, Marty?

03:23.740 --> 03:25.571
$200,000.

03:32.920 --> 03:36.629
$724,000 is all I've got
and it's earmarked.

03:36.710 --> 03:38.666
All you got sounds about right.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.196
You been here
when the dam's let out?

04:04.490 --> 04:06.151
No, I haven't.

04:08.830 --> 04:10.400
down to the spillway.

04:11.370 --> 04:14.453
Water temperature in the riverine
goes back to its natural state.

04:14.540 --> 04:15.780
Fish swim happy.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.628
They opened the control room
to the public when I was ten.

04:21.800 --> 04:25.918
Got on my bike,
just about broke my chain to get there.

04:26.890 --> 04:28.846
Heard the sirens,

04:28.930 --> 04:32.138
saw the cranes open the spill gates.
A miracle of modern engineering.

04:33.890 --> 04:36.848
I got back home,
my dad was ready to beat me.

04:37.770 --> 04:39.761
I had forgotten my chores.

04:39.860 --> 04:45.139
Managed to talk my way out of it
by sheer enthusiasm for science.

04:46.070 --> 04:47.367
Well...

04:47.870 --> 04:50.691
-he sounds like he was a reasonable man.
-Mm-hmm.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.452
Said he'd break my nose, I did it again.

04:55.670 --> 05:00.790
One year later, they opened the dam again.
I skipped my chores again.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.956
Shirked my responsibilities.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.296
You know what my dad did?

05:08.260 --> 05:09.636
Did he break your nose?

05:46.630 --> 05:50.339
Invasive species
wreak havoc on our ecosystem,

05:50.430 --> 05:53.058
none worse than the European starling.

05:53.510 --> 05:58.095
In 1890, a Bronx-born theater enthusiast
named Eugene Schieffelin

05:58.190 --> 06:01.057
took it upon himself
to introduce all aviary species

06:01.150 --> 06:04.563
mentioned in Shakespeare's plays
to the American continent.

06:04.650 --> 06:09.064
He began by releasing 100 starlings
into New York's Central Park.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.117
The starlings proliferated monumentally.

06:12.200 --> 06:16.864
They devoured entire orchards,
costing farmers millions each year.

06:16.950 --> 06:20.408
Today, over 200 million starlings
in North America

06:20.500 --> 06:24.618
consume nearly all the eggs
of the nearly-extinct eastern bluebird.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.837
More strange, and perhaps, tragic,

06:26.920 --> 06:29.377
starlings are attracted
to airplane engines

06:29.470 --> 06:32.883
and can incapacitate
in the blink of an eye.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.318
Caitlin and Ava got into
Mr. Hundley's drama class.

06:46.570 --> 06:48.697
You'll find your people, sweetie.
Just give it time.

06:48.780 --> 06:50.600
Please don't say, "Just give it time."

06:54.030 --> 06:55.691
Can I kill starlings?

06:56.790 --> 06:59.748
-What? _
-If I get a hunting license this semester?

07:01.620 --> 07:03.247
Honey, I don't want you shooting anything.

07:03.330 --> 07:04.831
You're supposed to kill starlings.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.832
They're invaders.
They steal nests and peck unhatched eggs.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.547
-Please stop talking.
-Charlotte.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.884
If you kill one female,
you've stopped the production of 11 birds.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.066
Okay. I'll be back later.

07:34.490 --> 07:36.822
- I love you.
- Love you.

07:47.630 --> 07:49.040
It's just a school.

07:50.050 --> 07:51.460
You're good at school.

08:17.910 --> 08:20.322
- Did you brush your teeth?
- I got gum.

08:20.750 --> 08:24.072
I can't pick your asses up
after school today. I gotta see my dad.

08:24.580 --> 08:26.787
Sure you don't wanna
let that bruise heal first?

08:26.880 --> 08:28.495
He said today, so today it is.

08:31.590 --> 08:34.252
They're gonna be fuckin' late
on the first day again.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.831
School's a waste anyway.
They read all the wrong shit.

08:36.930 --> 08:38.921
Oh, that'll play great in a job interview.

08:39.010 --> 08:40.921
Meet me in the truck.
I wanna talk to Ruth a sec.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.978
Hey, wait.
In case you guys get hungry.

08:46.270 --> 08:47.646
You seein' Cade today?

08:49.650 --> 08:52.608
If you didn't wanna worry,
you shouldn't have fuckin' hit me.

08:52.690 --> 08:55.352
I reacted fast, without thinking.

08:57.740 --> 08:58.809
They're gonna be late.

09:03.580 --> 09:04.740
An accessory.

09:05.290 --> 09:08.168
That is what she's gonna make you.
An accessory to murder.

09:09.210 --> 09:11.087
I mean, tell me you understand that.

09:12.170 --> 09:14.502
We'd be opening a bait shop
in fuckin' Bora Bora

09:14.590 --> 09:17.297
-by the time the cops came looking for me.
-Russ...

09:17.970 --> 09:21.633
I'm gonna get Byrde to invest in our shop.
Yours and mine.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.177
Because he's alive and he can give us
exactly what we need now.

09:24.270 --> 09:28.092
Not whatever tidbit your niece
decides to throw at you 'cause he's dead.

09:28.190 --> 09:30.226
Why... Why are you doing this?

09:31.770 --> 09:33.738
'Cause you're better
than you think you are.

09:39.910 --> 09:43.118
You are better than you think you are.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.037
I mean, I don't know how you don't see it.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.879
Promise me that you won't try
to kill Martin Byrde again.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.388
Mm-mm, mm-mm. I need the words.

10:04.350 --> 10:06.671
I won't try to kill
Marty Byrde again.

10:08.770 --> 10:09.839
Okay.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.147
It's a terrific new fund, you know.

10:12.230 --> 10:15.108
It's a bunch of real healthy new tech

10:15.190 --> 10:17.818
that I know that you're gonna like,
you know?

10:18.950 --> 10:20.656
Yeah, well, listen...

10:20.740 --> 10:24.039
Uh, I get it. Nygard is a...
He's a great guy.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.031
Are you kidding me, Don?
We gave you 18%.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.202
No one ever even gave you guys 12.

10:28.830 --> 10:32.459
Right. Well, uh,
Bruce brought you guys in, so...

10:34.670 --> 10:37.719
Yeah. Uh... I'll tell him if I see him.

10:37.800 --> 10:38.869
Thanks.

10:49.100 --> 10:54.015
Well, uh, listen,
is there a better time for us to talk?

10:54.110 --> 10:59.138
'Cause I definitely think it's worth
a couple of minutes of your time.

10:59.240 --> 11:02.357
It's a... It's a great fund.

11:04.120 --> 11:07.942
Okay. Yeah. Give my best to Sheri. Bye.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.742
Fifteen years, I look after their money,
I do a great job of it,

11:11.830 --> 11:13.206
and all they want is Bruce.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.956
They trusted you with their lives.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.257
You shut down on a moment's notice.
They feel betrayed.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.848
So is this new fund
gonna fix our Snell problem?

11:23.930 --> 11:28.594
I sure hope so. I mean, I gotta replace
every single cent that he took. $724,000.

11:29.560 --> 11:33.269
I figure I siphon off $800,000
from the new fund, I give it to Del.

11:33.350 --> 11:36.319
Soon as he gives me the new batch
to launder, I replace what I took.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.857
Unless one of the investors dies
in the next month or so,

11:38.940 --> 11:40.601
the won't even notice it was ever one.
Y

11:40.690 --> 11:43.158
You're all dressed up.

11:44.740 --> 11:46.901
Not really. Just work.

11:59.590 --> 12:00.409
What?

12:03.050 --> 12:04.460
Let her have this one.

12:05.390 --> 12:09.838
It looks like a zombie mermaid
pissmg In the ocean.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.091
It's gonna be the first thing
someone sees when they walk in.

12:12.180 --> 12:13.056
-Wendy--
-Sam.

12:15.350 --> 12:18.569
Hi. Sorry to bother you.
Are you showing this house today?

12:18.650 --> 12:21.562
-No, I'm sorry. Not till Tuesday.
-Oh.

12:21.650 --> 12:24.278
- My bad, then. I'll just come back then.
- Okay.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.406
Actually...

12:26.070 --> 12:30.029
would you happen to have
any other property similar to this?

12:30.120 --> 12:31.496
Same price range?

12:31.580 --> 12:35.414
- Why, yes, we do.
- Oh, that would be great.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.206
-Are you showing them?
-We are.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.588
My wife and I just moved in
from Boston last week.

12:39.670 --> 12:42.707
If she has to stay in a motel any longer,
she's gonna divorce me.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.041
-Sam, I'm gonna... Okay?
-Oh. Yeah.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.348
-Come with me. I can take you.
-Oh, that's great. Thank you.

12:48.430 --> 12:49.636
Sure.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.302
-Just follow me. I'm Wendy, by the way.
-Nice to meet you. Thanks.

12:52.390 --> 12:54.130
You came at the perfect time.

12:54.230 --> 12:57.939
Off-season just started,
so we have this influx of good properties.

12:58.020 --> 13:01.524
So, I'm gonna take you
to see a place at the Four Seasons,

13:01.610 --> 13:03.487
and then we'll head over to Cedar Crest.

13:03.570 --> 13:06.812
And we'll swing by the main strip.
So it's a five-star tour.

13:08.950 --> 13:11.327
When did you stop being Wendy Byrde?

13:16.420 --> 13:17.990
Excuse me, have we met before?

13:18.080 --> 13:21.083
You know how easy it is
to ﬁnd information on people nowadays.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.007
Is that Lakeside High School?

13:26.630 --> 13:28.427
I thought you said
you weren't from the area.

13:28.510 --> 13:30.137
Where Jonah and Charlotte go, right?

13:39.810 --> 13:42.688
- Okay, what do you want?
- We've been clear.

13:43.860 --> 13:47.273
-Eight million, clean.
-At the end of the summer.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.867
Didn't you just say it's an off-season?

13:50.950 --> 13:52.440
September let.

13:52.530 --> 13:55.192
And we still have_ time.
We're practically finished.

13:55.870 --> 13:57.610
Deposits have slowed.

13:57.710 --> 13:59.826
Marty hasn't been to the Blue Cat
in a while.

14:00.670 --> 14:01.910
Something's off.

14:02.750 --> 14:06.413
You should just accept that our eyes
are on you and yours, Ms. Byrde.

14:06.510 --> 14:10.082
Davis. Whoever the fuck you are.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.970
Jesus, Marty, he knows the kids' names.

14:25.070 --> 14:27.527
- What'd he sound like?
- Like a scary motherfucker!

14:27.610 --> 14:30.738
Like this is some kind of game to him.
You say you know who this is?

14:30.820 --> 14:33.732
-I might.
-Oh, God.

14:33.830 --> 14:35.946
Oh, what should we...
Oh, God! What can we do?

14:36.040 --> 14:39.282
-No, don't. Listen. We'll get the money.
-Jesus. Fuck. How?

14:39.370 --> 14:42.077
Doesn't sound like your old clients
are much help.

14:42.170 --> 14:44.081
We'll see.
But I'm gonna bulldoze the church.

14:44.170 --> 14:45.956
-We'll start something new.
-It'll take time.

14:46.050 --> 14:48.371
-I'll get it. I promise.
-Promises aren't gonna save our lives.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.007
Yeah. No shit, Wendy.
Do you have any suggestions?

14:55.310 --> 14:56.345
Ijust might.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.302
You expect me to believe that
you've never wanted to do anything else?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.106
Well, I mean, after my father died,

15:03.190 --> 15:06.318
there was no way my mother
could handle the business on her own.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.063
Listen, I hate to see someone
with so much potential just...

15:11.070 --> 15:13.618
Well, we probably just
shouldn't talk about it.

15:14.450 --> 15:17.487
How would I do anything different
at this point in my life?

15:17.580 --> 15:20.492
Well, I mean... How about all that money
she's always talking about?

15:20.580 --> 15:23.458
I always want my kids to feel like
they can invade their inheritance

15:23.540 --> 15:25.701
if it's to further a life's goal.

15:26.500 --> 15:29.048
Yeah, but my mom,
she lives off that money.

15:29.130 --> 15:30.791
Well, not all of it, surely.

15:31.340 --> 15:32.716
No, I... I mean, I guess not.

15:33.510 --> 15:35.296
Do you know how much there is?

15:35.390 --> 15:37.927
Or, you know, if she's doing
everything she can to maximize returns?

15:38.020 --> 15:39.419
Marty says that's key.

15:40.310 --> 15:41.880
Uh, $906,000.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.437
I mean, according to the last statement.

15:46.110 --> 15:48.431
Well... I mean, that's plenty.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.947
I mean,
if she's investing it properly. Do...

15:52.030 --> 15:55.818
-What are you... What?
-No, never mind.

15:55.910 --> 15:57.946
-You were gonna say something.
-No. I'm sorry. I...

15:58.040 --> 15:59.940
-Come on.
-I really shouldn't. I...

16:02.660 --> 16:06.039
You know,
Marty's a financial advisor, and...

16:08.460 --> 16:11.213
he's starting an exclusive fund
here on the lake.

16:11.300 --> 16:14.463
He's investing private clients' money
of a million and up.

16:14.550 --> 16:19.419
Which is, you know, more than you have,
but... maybe I could talk to him.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.808
-See if he'd make an exception.
-I don't think... No, she won't wanna--

16:22.890 --> 16:24.721
Sam, come on, you're a grown man.

16:24.810 --> 16:28.314
What? Are you gonna be strong-armed
by your mommy for the rest of your life?

16:29.190 --> 16:33.945
Talk to Eugenia. I mean, have her put
your inheritance in Marty's hands.

16:34.030 --> 16:36.942
I mean, with his connections,
he could turn 906

16:37.030 --> 16:40.158
into 1.5 in two years, easy.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.536
She can't ever know that
you two are related, though.

16:44.620 --> 16:45.609
She won't.

16:45.710 --> 16:47.996
I mean,
I go by Wendy Davis, professionally.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.546
Marty's last name is Byrde.

16:50.420 --> 16:53.048
All right. I'll talk to her.

16:53.130 --> 16:54.176
-Good. Good.
-Okay?

16:54.260 --> 16:57.081
'Cause then you'll be able to do
whatever it is you want to do.

16:59.890 --> 17:01.209
Motivational speaker.

17:03.140 --> 17:06.394
I... I can't believe that
I just said that out loud.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.641
I've never told anybody that before.
Just so you know.

17:08.730 --> 17:11.358
-That's amazing. Amazing.
-Yeah?

17:11.440 --> 17:14.989
-Joey, thank you. Go ahead. Take it down.
-Thanks.

17:15.070 --> 17:18.119
-I... I don't understand.
-Yeah. Well, it's the zoning issues

17:18.200 --> 17:20.441
that we were talking about.
I'm pissed off, too.

17:20.530 --> 17:22.191
Well, what exactly is the issue?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.150
-The specific issue? Yeah, it's a...
-Exactly.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.457
Boy, it's complicated. It's a...
You know...

17:28.920 --> 17:32.913
The circumference
of the sewage lines,

17:33.010 --> 17:36.127
they're just not big enough for a church.
It's code or something.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.632
-Gonna figure it out. Don't worry.
-How long is that gonna take?

17:38.720 --> 17:41.257
-I'm not sure. _
-Peter came to me last night in a dream

17:41.350 --> 17:43.466
and told me that this community
wants a church.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.766
-Peter?
-Peter, the apostle.

17:44.850 --> 17:47.262
- The rock on which the church was built.
- Right. Well...

17:47.350 --> 17:49.306
Sewage was so different
back then, you know?

17:49.400 --> 17:51.015
I'm gonna keep you up-to-date.
Hang in there.

17:51.110 --> 17:52.566
I'm not gonna call it a service, then.

17:52.650 --> 17:54.606
-What's_that? _
-I'm not gonna call it a sewice, then.

17:54.690 --> 17:57.397
No altar, no pulpit...
Everyone will sit in a circle.

17:57.490 --> 17:59.651
We have a constitutional right
to practice our faith.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.150
-Stop, just stop.
-We do, Marty.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.697
We're not gonna let bureaucrats
get in the way of our God-given right.

18:03.790 --> 18:06.076
You're not gonna do anything
on this property. Period.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.286
-Yes, I will.
-No, you are not!

18:07.370 --> 18:09.782
-Why?
-Because there is no fucking zoning issue.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.992
The Snells are drug dealers.

18:14.090 --> 18:16.718
They're running heroin on the water
every Sunday when you preach,

18:16.800 --> 18:19.792
through hymnals that are passed
to their dealers from your boat.

18:21.050 --> 18:22.347
They're farmers.

18:23.100 --> 18:26.763
They're poppy farmers. Their barns
are drying houses for poppy gum.

18:26.850 --> 18:28.260
They don't want us building a church.

18:28.350 --> 18:30.978
They want you on the water every Sunday,
so they can they distribute.

18:31.060 --> 18:32.607
Who told you this?

18:32.690 --> 18:34.726
Ever notice your hymn books
are two different colors?

18:34.820 --> 18:35.809
Ever wonder why that is?

18:35.900 --> 18:38.812
The blue ones are hollow. They're filled
with heroin in heat-sealed bags.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.697
-Oh, my God.
-I wanted to build you a church.

18:40.780 --> 18:44.329
Honest to God. I had no idea
I was disrupting a trafﬁcking ring.

18:45.410 --> 18:48.288
You're saying that
all my parishioners are drug dealers?

18:48.370 --> 18:51.453
No... There's no way to know.
It's probably just a few of them.

18:51.540 --> 18:53.701
-"Probably just a few of them."
-Yeah. Preach to the other ones.

18:53.790 --> 18:57.123
Talk about the scourge of drugs
or give the forgiveness sermon.

18:57.210 --> 18:59.178
Or just keep saying
whatever you've been saying.

18:59.260 --> 19:00.466
Just keep saying it.

19:01.090 --> 19:04.753
Otherwise they're gonna come after you,
and you, and then my family is next.

19:06.180 --> 19:09.138
Tell me you're gonna stay on the water.
Mason? Hey.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.219
Grace?

19:13.480 --> 19:14.606
He will.

19:21.070 --> 19:22.947
I won't try to kill
Marty Byrde again.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.076
That was fast.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.997
I got lucky, I guess.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.287
Humble. Not much like you.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.819
He'll turn easy.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.411
-I'|| scare him.
-And Byrde?

19:36.500 --> 19:38.877
Once we get Ruth, the niece.

19:39.460 --> 19:40.666
What about her?

19:41.300 --> 19:42.676
She'll turn, too.

19:43.180 --> 19:45.421
He'll make her. He's fucked.

19:46.810 --> 19:50.223
-Protocol calls for backup-
—Oh, fuck protocol.

19:50.310 --> 19:52.767
-You can't fuck protocol, Roy.
-Look,

19:52.850 --> 19:56.513
we only got to this point 'cause
me and him have developed goodwill.

19:56.610 --> 19:59.989
So let's not bring in a gaggle of feds
and fuck it all up.

20:00.070 --> 20:01.856
I'm not saying a gaggle.

20:03.150 --> 20:04.310
Just me.

20:04.740 --> 20:07.322
And I'm saying... wait.

20:09.370 --> 20:12.328
He needs a handler
that can approach local law enforcement.

20:12.410 --> 20:13.991
You're still undercover.

20:15.710 --> 20:18.292
Is there something about this Langmore
I don't understand?

20:20.380 --> 20:21.369
No.

20:22.220 --> 20:23.209
No.

20:26.470 --> 20:27.630
He's yours.

20:41.570 --> 20:43.356
Oh. Jackpot, brother.

20:45.740 --> 20:46.866
Omega.

20:46.950 --> 20:48.065
Damn.

20:50.330 --> 20:51.786
Every fucking year...

20:52.540 --> 20:53.700
they come...

20:54.920 --> 20:57.536
we pick through their trash
when they leave.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.541
Rinse, repeat.

21:00.630 --> 21:02.166
That's a grand, easy.

21:11.180 --> 21:14.013
--You worried about Cade, that it?

21:14.690 --> 21:17.477
-No.
-He wouldn't do nothing to his own blood.

21:17.560 --> 21:20.859
Even if you did hit his kid.
He knows what she's like.

21:23.860 --> 21:25.851
Marty Byrde? That it?

21:27.360 --> 21:28.907
We'll get another shot at him.

21:32.660 --> 21:34.787
I've been thinking
about doing something different.

21:35.410 --> 21:36.661
I don't know, like...

21:37.250 --> 21:39.070
bait and tackle or some shit.

21:39.580 --> 21:40.786
Higher end.

21:41.210 --> 21:43.872
Makin' people come to me for a change.

21:44.550 --> 21:45.585
By yourself?

21:46.840 --> 21:47.716
I don't know.

21:49.010 --> 21:49.840
Maybe.

22:01.900 --> 22:02.889
Beer?

22:14.910 --> 22:16.616
I know people think I'm stupid.

22:17.250 --> 22:21.334
-What are you talking about?
-It's okay. I know what they say.

22:22.630 --> 22:25.622
But I see things, perception-wise.

22:27.260 --> 22:28.079
Okay.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.079
What I'm saying is...

22:31.720 --> 22:35.019
we're all different
than what people think, in some ways.

22:35.970 --> 22:37.130
Nothing wrong with it.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.509
What's your point?

22:42.560 --> 22:43.970
All I'm sayin'...

22:45.030 --> 22:47.851
You wanna do something else,
be something else,

22:47.940 --> 22:49.237
I got your back, that's all.

22:56.750 --> 22:57.865
Yeah, you're right.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.820
I'm just worried about Cade.

23:03.250 --> 23:07.209
These people are drug dealers, Mason.
What don't you understand about that?

23:07.760 --> 23:11.673
They proﬁt from addiction,
overdose, death.

23:11.760 --> 23:15.423
They're not gonna let our faith
or my pregnancy stand in their way.

23:15.510 --> 23:17.512
So if you refuse
to go back out on that water--

23:17.600 --> 23:20.137
I'm not gonna traffic in the name of God.

23:20.230 --> 23:21.345
Then start packing.

23:21.980 --> 23:24.357
We're not the kind of people
who run from something like this.

23:24.440 --> 23:27.682
-We have a child to worry about now.
-That God will protect.

23:27.780 --> 23:29.236
Just like he did in St. Louis.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.355
-Mason--
-That bullet

23:30.450 --> 23:34.272
was three-tenths of an inch
from rupturing my aorta.

23:34.370 --> 23:38.534
But it went clean through.
That is not a coincidence.

23:42.210 --> 23:44.166
God wasn't protecting you.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.990
The kid had shitty aim.

23:55.260 --> 23:58.093
If you won't leave, just...

23:59.100 --> 24:02.263
please, go back out on the water.
I'm begging you.

24:02.350 --> 24:04.341
At least until the baby's born.
And then...

24:04.440 --> 24:07.682
...then we can
figure out what to do after that.

24:10.530 --> 24:11.849
Where are you going?

24:12.610 --> 24:13.941
To fuckin' pray.

24:16.490 --> 24:18.867
A commitment is something
we take so seriously,

24:18.950 --> 24:20.998
we vow never to break it.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.742
This pledge is
a particularly important commitment,

24:23.830 --> 24:26.321
because drugs
are the most destructive force

24:26.420 --> 24:30.004
affecting America today.
You can sign your papers now.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.541
Signing this is essential
in early adolescence,

24:34.640 --> 24:38.508
since we're developing and cementing
our personal moral code

24:38.600 --> 24:40.807
while peer pressure is at its peak.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.549
Oh, Jonah, you haven't signed?

24:47.400 --> 24:48.515
Can I think about it?

24:49.820 --> 24:52.027
What could you possibly
have to think about?

24:53.280 --> 24:55.771
Well, it... It's complicated.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.117
I mean, the economics of it all.

24:58.870 --> 25:01.111
Um, I need the paper, Jonah.

25:04.750 --> 25:05.739
Signed.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.299
You wouldn't want me to sign something
I don't completely believe in, would you?

25:10.380 --> 25:12.587
--Quiet.

25:15.090 --> 25:18.799
Uh, you don't think it's important
to say no to drugs and alcohol?

25:19.560 --> 25:20.925
Well, it's just not that simple.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.920
How is it not that simple?
Drugs are addictive.

25:24.020 --> 25:27.649
-They cause crime and death.
-And they also prop up the US economy.

25:27.730 --> 25:29.812
--I said quiet.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.026
What are you talking about?

25:32.610 --> 25:35.238
Are you familiar
with gross domestic product?

25:35.320 --> 25:38.983
-It's the total of all the money spent--
-I know what gross domestic product is.

25:40.870 --> 25:43.407
I mean, I'd definitely sign
something that says,

25:43.490 --> 25:46.038
"It'd be great
if people didn't get addicted to drugs."

25:46.120 --> 25:49.829
But... people are addicted to drugs.

25:49.920 --> 25:53.083
And in order to get the drugs,
they have to buy them, right?

25:53.670 --> 25:55.752
And that drug dealer
has to feed his family.

25:55.840 --> 25:58.377
They're innocent.
They can't starve, can they?

25:58.470 --> 26:02.179
-Jonah, how about we just--
-They need a house and clothes.

26:02.260 --> 26:05.309
And the family needs a car.
There's even this theory that says

26:05.390 --> 26:07.631
drug money was the only thing
that prevented the collapse

26:07.730 --> 26:10.107
of the global economy in 2008.

26:10.190 --> 26:11.851
You know, when real estate went bust.

26:11.940 --> 26:16.479
Because drug money was the only cash
available to prop up big banks.

26:16.570 --> 26:19.698
Not to mention
the 350 million narco-dollars

26:19.780 --> 26:23.659
that paid for bridges and roads
and health care...

26:23.740 --> 26:27.039
probably even education.
Maybe even part of this school.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.623
Jonah, would you step outside
for a minute, please?

26:32.710 --> 26:34.792
You gotta admit he's right,
economically speaking.

26:34.880 --> 26:38.293
-I mean, it's not easy to hear, but--
-This was not an intellectual exercise.

26:38.380 --> 26:41.338
All right? This was a promise
not to use drugs or to pressure others.

26:42.050 --> 26:44.302
Some of his classmates
ripped up their pledges after he spoke.

26:44.390 --> 26:47.097
-I assure you that was not his intent.
-Oh, so you say.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.057
But still,
not a particularly auspicious start

26:50.150 --> 26:51.640
for either of your kids at Lakeside.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.349
What does that mean?

26:53.440 --> 26:55.601
First, Charlotte doesn't show up to school,
then this.

26:55.690 --> 26:57.100
No, I dropped her off myself.

26:57.190 --> 26:58.851
-I'll call her.
-When were you gonna tell us?

26:58.950 --> 27:01.737
School poliw is to send out a text
and an e-mail at the end of the day.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.776
That's a stupid fucking policy!

27:03.870 --> 27:06.612
This is a large public school, Mrs. Byrde.

27:06.700 --> 27:07.940
Voicemail.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.206
Hey, Jonah? Have you seen Charlotte?

27:13.290 --> 27:15.246
Charlotte came into school with you,
didn't she?

27:15.340 --> 27:16.329
Yeah, what's the matter?

27:16.420 --> 27:18.331
-She never went to class.
-When did you last see her?

27:18.420 --> 27:22.504
Well, she was over there by the lockers.
Then Wyatt came over and talked to her.

27:22.590 --> 27:24.501
They went down the hall
and I had to go to class.

27:25.350 --> 27:26.339
Wyatt!

27:27.520 --> 27:29.977
Charlotte is missing.
She was at school today, but not in class.

27:30.060 --> 27:31.300
Apparently, she was with Wyatt.

27:31.390 --> 27:32.641
- Where is he?
- Wyatt!

27:33.150 --> 27:35.436
-Wyatt!
-Fuck! What?

27:36.020 --> 27:37.476
Where's Charlotte?

27:37.570 --> 27:39.026
Tell these people where their daughter is.

27:39.110 --> 27:40.190
I don't know, honestly.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.271
You talked to her in the hallway.
What'd she say?

27:43.240 --> 27:47.654
-I will kick your sorry, ditching ass.
-This is not just about skipping school.

27:48.290 --> 27:51.657
She said that she's going
to Chicago. I walked her to the station.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.160
-That's just what she said.
-Chicago?

27:53.250 --> 27:54.285
- I don't know.
- Jesus.

27:54.380 --> 27:57.872
-She has to transfer in_ St. Louis.
-Well, let's go to St. LOUIS. Come on.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.009
- You have Sam's mom.
- Oh, I'll put that off, Wendy.

28:01.090 --> 28:02.580
No, you can't. We can't.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.136
I can't? What about Charlotte?

28:04.220 --> 28:05.756
- I'll go.
- You're gonna go?

28:05.850 --> 28:07.386
What'll I do? Just walk to Sam's?

28:07.470 --> 28:10.348
I'm visiting my dad near St. Louis.
I was gonna leave an hour ago.

28:10.430 --> 28:11.931
But I can show you near the station.

28:12.020 --> 28:14.306
- Okay. Let's go.
- Oh, and you can borrow the beast.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.068
Oh, it's running again, huh?

28:17.730 --> 28:19.140
Uh, yeah, I got it fixed.

28:19.780 --> 28:22.317
Here. I'll text you.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.607
-Okay. Yeah. Be careful, please.
-Got it?

28:28.450 --> 28:29.576
Dad!

28:30.580 --> 28:32.207
-Hey, buddy.
-You forgot I was here.

28:32.290 --> 28:33.780
I did not forget you were here.

28:33.870 --> 28:37.419
-Jump in.
-It's okay. There's a lot going on.

28:37.500 --> 28:40.378
Yeah, a lot going on.
Nothing more important than you, though.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.012
Sometimes I lose my way

28:52.560 --> 28:55.688
I forget the words that I say...

28:58.020 --> 28:59.226
Darlene.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.736
--Look who I found.

29:03.570 --> 29:06.653
- Well, hello there.
- Hi. Good to see you.

29:06.740 --> 29:07.900
Likewise.

29:08.870 --> 29:11.236
- It's quite a party y'all throwing here.
- Mm-hmm.

29:11.330 --> 29:13.992
-How's Grace?
-She's good. She's getting close.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.741
- That's good to hear.
- Mm-hmm.

29:17.540 --> 29:23.206
-What is it you said you do for a living?
-Well, we got bees, flowers... livestock.

29:23.300 --> 29:24.961
That's our piglet on a spit.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.718
-Just working farm.
-And I make soap.

29:31.140 --> 29:34.928
-Flowers. What kind _of flowers?
-Poppies, mainly.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.339
What kind of poppies?

29:39.730 --> 29:42.142
Now, why do I get the feeling that,

29:42.230 --> 29:45.779
right in the middle of my employee
soire, I'm being interrogated?

29:47.360 --> 29:49.362
I can't preach on the water
for you anymore.

29:50.280 --> 29:53.033
-For me?
-I'm gonna get you boys some lemonade.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.247
-Just stay right here.
-I know what you're doing.

29:55.330 --> 29:58.242
I'm not here to judge you for it,
but I can't participate in it either.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.581
We're not sure what you're talking about.

30:00.670 --> 30:04.162
I know that you've been dealing heroin
off of my boat on Sunday mornings,

30:04.260 --> 30:07.297
in the blue hymnals, somewhere
between the psalm and the sermon.

30:09.470 --> 30:10.755
I'm not calling the police.

30:10.850 --> 30:14.559
But you're gonna have to figure out
some other way to traffic your drugs,

30:14.640 --> 30:16.130
and it can't be through me.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.726
Why?

30:19.900 --> 30:21.140
I'm sorry. "Why?"

30:22.570 --> 30:25.983
When you preach
and you look out over all those souls...

30:26.900 --> 30:28.527
are none of them lost?

30:29.110 --> 30:31.772
Or do you just preach to the choir?

30:33.780 --> 30:35.611
You know the Four Soils?

30:36.330 --> 30:37.991
Yeah, I know the parable.

30:39.290 --> 30:41.246
Cold, hard ground,

30:41.330 --> 30:45.084
stony, shallow ground,
the weeds, the rich earth.

30:46.170 --> 30:47.467
Which am I?

30:48.630 --> 30:49.676
Hmm?

30:51.090 --> 30:54.969
I run one of the biggest farms
in the county.

30:55.970 --> 31:00.395
I employ scores of families,
I... cherish them, fete them,

31:00.480 --> 31:04.314
and my wife does...
untold kindnesses you'll never see.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.101
What about our souls? Can they be saved?

31:08.690 --> 31:10.521
Or maybe they ain't lost.

31:11.610 --> 31:13.737
I think you've had a hard life.

31:13.820 --> 31:16.152
I can see that. I get your struggle.

31:16.240 --> 31:18.868
God sent you his teachings,
but are you listening?

31:20.750 --> 31:23.742
I want my church, sir.

31:25.550 --> 31:28.667
You have your church. On the water.

31:29.930 --> 31:32.467
Darlene, stay and listen.

31:32.550 --> 31:35.849
-I'm through listening.
-Stay and listen.

31:36.760 --> 31:39.888
Now, Jesus, he preached the Four Soils

31:39.980 --> 31:42.938
from the water to those gathered
on the beach. Did he not?

31:43.020 --> 31:47.138
Mm-hmm. And did they deal drugs
while Jesus was giving his sermons?

31:47.230 --> 31:50.563
What do you think? You think
they were all pure as driven snow?

31:50.650 --> 31:52.060
Are you that innocent?

31:52.160 --> 31:53.559
Don't you mean naive?

31:53.660 --> 31:55.776
You have your church.
Why would you want another?

31:55.870 --> 32:01.319
Marty Byrde.
Marty Byrde wants to build us a church.

32:01.410 --> 32:02.616
- That what he wants?
- Yes.

32:02.710 --> 32:05.668
Because he's a religious man?

32:05.750 --> 32:07.206
Because he's an angel?

32:07.920 --> 32:10.411
--Why would Martin Byrde want a church?

32:11.090 --> 32:12.671
You ever think about that?

32:13.630 --> 32:15.678
He's a money launderer, son.

32:15.760 --> 32:20.720
He wants to build, and build, and build,
inflate construction costs, and run money

32:20.810 --> 32:23.301
through a building
that's never gonna get built.

32:23.850 --> 32:25.602
- Drug money.
- I don't believe that.

32:26.980 --> 32:31.940
Check his books, son.
See how much building he pays for in cash.

32:39.580 --> 32:43.573
Now, I don't know
if Marty's a good man or a bad man.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.532
I think we're all good and bad.

32:47.630 --> 32:51.259
But I think you should consider
what it is you do best.

32:52.420 --> 32:55.253
Which is standing on the bow of a boat...

32:56.050 --> 32:59.929
bringing God to those
whose hearts you might open.

33:04.730 --> 33:06.140
If I go back on the water...

33:07.060 --> 33:10.973
I am going to preach to those
who have committed grievous sins...

33:11.900 --> 33:13.140
on your behalf.

33:13.900 --> 33:15.310
I have to do that.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.520
And I would expect nothing less.

33:35.510 --> 33:39.139
Chicago. Terminal six?
Where the fuck is terminal six?

33:40.180 --> 33:41.807
I think it's over there. Come on.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.760
I'll look for her upstairs.

34:25.020 --> 34:27.477
Charlotte! Charlotte!

34:30.560 --> 34:31.640
Mom?

34:32.570 --> 34:33.810
Charlotte.

34:38.450 --> 34:40.771
You can never do this to me again.
Do you understand?

34:40.870 --> 34:42.326
I'm sorry.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.321
- What is wrong?

34:45.410 --> 34:48.618
-What is going on?
-I want our old life back.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.296
- I'm so sorry.

34:55.590 --> 34:57.660
It doesn't exist anymore, sweetheart.

34:59.260 --> 35:01.637
We have to stay together as a family.
Do you understand?

35:01.720 --> 35:03.290
- Yeah.
- We have to.

35:07.020 --> 35:08.009
Okay.

35:10.560 --> 35:11.549
Let's go.

35:15.070 --> 35:17.732
It all comes down
to safety and trust.

35:17.820 --> 35:22.814
'Cause we're constantly getting sold to
or advertised to or... or promised to.

35:22.910 --> 35:25.481
Um, I think half the reason
that we cave sometimes

35:25.580 --> 35:27.821
is 'cause we have no idea _
what the other person's saying, right?

35:27.910 --> 35:28.899
Take your car to a mechanic,

35:29.000 --> 35:30.740
you pray to God
what he's telling you is the truth.

35:30.830 --> 35:33.037
-It's crazy.
-So what are you sellin' me?

35:33.130 --> 35:35.746
Yeah. Yeah. Straight to the point.
I appreciate that.

35:35.840 --> 35:37.296
Uh, okay.

35:37.380 --> 35:39.371
Eugenia, in a perfect world,

35:39.470 --> 35:41.677
a woman as smart as you
would not need someone like me

35:41.760 --> 35:45.469
to help you with your money,
but it's not a perfect world.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.427
So here's what I offer my clients.
I offer two things. Number one:

35:48.520 --> 35:52.809
I offer a safe but aggressive
investment scheme

35:52.900 --> 35:55.858
that follows the... the way
that economics are trending, right?

35:55.940 --> 35:58.181
'Cause I read the...
There's this... uh, report.

35:58.280 --> 36:00.646
I'm sure you don't read it
'cause it would bore you to death.

36:00.740 --> 36:03.812
But I do.
I read them. I like them.

36:03.910 --> 36:06.822
God knows why.
Probably 'cause I'm a nerd, right?

36:06.910 --> 36:08.366
Son, is your dad a nerd?

36:08.450 --> 36:10.782
-Total.
-See? He knows.

36:10.870 --> 36:13.998
The... the second thing, and I think this
is more important than the first thing,

36:14.080 --> 36:18.039
it is that... that safety and trust thing.
Um, well, first let me ask you,

36:18.130 --> 36:20.462
has an advisor ever asked you
what your financial goals are?

36:20.550 --> 36:21.665
First thing they say.

36:22.340 --> 36:24.581
Very first thing. Always, right?
And I could be wrong here,

36:24.680 --> 36:27.001
but your goal is to make as much money
as possible, right?

36:27.100 --> 36:29.170
Isn't that...
That's gotta be the goal, right, Sam?

36:29.270 --> 36:32.057
-Uh, yeah, yeah. Only point I see.
-Right.

36:32.140 --> 36:36.224
So, what I do is I invest your money
exactly the way I invest mine.

36:36.310 --> 36:39.689
Safe. You can trust me.
You do well, I do well.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.856
And right here inside this folder

36:41.940 --> 36:44.408
is a detailed description
of exactly how I do that.

36:44.490 --> 36:45.809
In this pocket right here,

36:45.910 --> 36:49.289
that's a history of all the assets
that I've had under my management.

36:49.370 --> 36:50.746
The ROIs of those funds.

36:50.830 --> 36:53.617
What's to stop me from taking this
to the guy I've worked with for years,

36:53.710 --> 36:56.918
and tell him, "Do what Marty Byrde does"?

36:57.960 --> 37:01.009
Nothing. Nothing would stop you.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.961
You know, I'm...
I'm not begging for your business.

37:05.050 --> 37:06.460
I would... I would love to have it.

37:06.550 --> 37:09.804
However, if you would feel more
comfortable with your current manager,

37:09.890 --> 37:11.300
I'd recommend that you do that.

37:11.390 --> 37:14.518
'Cause, as... as I was saying,
I think that the most important thing,

37:17.400 --> 37:21.279
- So, you think and I'm done. That's it.
- Mm-hmm.

37:21.360 --> 37:25.239
Okay. I appreciate meeting you, Eugenia.
And Sam, I appreciate the meeting.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.062
- Yeah.
- Beautiful art, by the way, behind him.

37:28.160 --> 37:31.698
Son, should we do it?
Thank you, guys, very much.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.786
-Wait. Wait.
-Yeah.

37:34.870 --> 37:36.952
- Let's do this. Let's do this right now.
- What?

37:37.040 --> 37:38.621
-Be done with it.
-Yeah?

37:38.710 --> 37:40.450
Come on. Come on back in.

37:41.420 --> 37:42.626
-Right now.
-Okay.

38:28.050 --> 38:29.540
Is it okay if I leave my phone here?

38:30.220 --> 38:32.302
-Sure.
-Thanks.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.952
You wanna tell me _
why Marty Byrde's still alive?

39:08.550 --> 39:10.506
Someone messed with my riggin'.

39:11.970 --> 39:14.131
You said no one was gonna be there.

39:18.390 --> 39:21.518
In the half hour it took
to pick him up and bring him back...

39:22.560 --> 39:24.471
the transformer was reconnected.

39:28.190 --> 39:29.236
What happened to your face?

39:31.610 --> 39:35.398
-I got into a fight with a stripper.
-What's that? Speak up.

39:35.490 --> 39:37.538
I got...
I got into a fight with a stripper.

39:37.620 --> 39:38.860
She had a ring on.

39:39.790 --> 39:42.998
I meant the cheeks
and the lips and the eye caps.

39:44.380 --> 39:45.870
You look like a whore.

39:48.340 --> 39:52.219
You know where the phrase
"Don't stick your neck out" comes from?

39:53.640 --> 39:55.039
Fuckin' chickens.

39:55.890 --> 39:57.801
When they feel their head
on the choppin' block,

39:57.890 --> 40:00.688
they actually
stick their fuckin' necks out.

40:00.770 --> 40:04.262
Makes it_ easier
to chop off their own heads.

40:05.310 --> 40:08.643
- Mmm. Stupid, huh?

40:11.570 --> 40:14.357
- Stupid chickens.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.235
No.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.575
Stupid you.

40:23.920 --> 40:27.208
You had Marty Byrde and you let him go.

40:30.630 --> 40:34.509
-I told you...
-Don't come back here until he's dead.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.326
What do you think her dad did
to end up in there?

41:47.420 --> 41:50.583
Well, it's a transition
from a maximum security prison, so...

41:50.670 --> 41:51.955
Something serious.

41:55.510 --> 41:59.298
All day, I've seen versions
of how I could end up and I hate them all.

42:00.970 --> 42:02.767
I miss who I was.

42:03.600 --> 42:05.306
I miss my friends.

42:05.390 --> 42:08.018
Your friends are always gonna
be your friends, no matter what.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.761
You don't know that.

42:10.570 --> 42:13.027
You made it so that
I can't tell them anything.

42:13.940 --> 42:17.444
I have to pretend like the worst,
scariest, most damaging thing in my life

42:17.530 --> 42:19.441
is actually fucking awesome.

42:20.410 --> 42:24.073
And watching their Snapchat stories
is like FOMO 24/7.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.820
I hear you. I really do.

42:28.330 --> 42:30.912
Animals mimic their parents' behavior,
you know that?

42:31.790 --> 42:34.839
But I will not suffer in silence.
I am not you.

42:35.630 --> 42:38.793
-That's not fair. _
-Well, where are your friends?

42:38.880 --> 42:40.427
What do you tell them?

42:41.260 --> 42:43.592
I tell them what I believe to be true.

42:44.350 --> 42:46.978
That this is a family sabbatical.

42:48.060 --> 42:49.516
Return to simplicity.

42:51.940 --> 42:53.646
You hate it here, too.

43:33.560 --> 43:35.778
It's the ﬁrst thing people see
when they come in.

43:35.860 --> 43:36.849
That's the point.

43:36.940 --> 43:39.568
Did you not hear what Marty Byrde
said about it?

43:39.650 --> 43:43.279
He complimented it.
So, he's a smart man.

43:43.370 --> 43:46.407
-He could teach you a few things.
-I introduced you two.

43:47.240 --> 43:50.118
Kid puts blacklight posters
all over his room.

43:50.210 --> 43:53.668
Now he lectures me about art?

43:53.750 --> 43:54.739
Okay.

43:54.840 --> 43:59.288
Inherits a business,
and now he's the last tycoon.

43:59.380 --> 44:02.178
You're my employee, Mom.
You work for me, remember?

44:02.260 --> 44:06.344
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

44:07.140 --> 44:10.018
All I heard were the mutterings of someone

44:10.100 --> 44:14.764
who lets the dog lick peanut butter
off his feet.

44:16.480 --> 44:18.641
Can I... Can I ask you a question?

44:19.230 --> 44:24.315
Why do you have to be such a constant,
24/7, nagging, incessant fucking bitch?

44:24.950 --> 44:26.690
My entire fucking adult life,

44:26.780 --> 44:29.829
I've listened to your garbage
that you tell me about myself.

44:29.910 --> 44:33.038
Is this back to that college thing?

44:33.120 --> 44:35.452
You never would have survived
out of state.

44:37.340 --> 44:39.240
Where do you think Marty Byrde lives, Mom?

44:39.340 --> 44:43.174
-What do I care?
-In Buddy Dieker's old house...

44:43.260 --> 44:46.889
with Wendy Davis. Wendy Davis Byrde.

44:47.470 --> 44:51.019
Yeah. That's right, Mom. Surprise!
They're married.

44:53.230 --> 44:55.186
You lied to me.

44:55.810 --> 44:59.018
Call him. I want those papers back.
I'm gonna rip them up.

44:59.110 --> 45:01.647
Oh, you want 'em back?
Why don't you call him yourself, okay?

45:02.610 --> 45:04.987
Oh, and you know what? You're ﬁred.

45:08.450 --> 45:09.610
Where are you going?

45:10.750 --> 45:14.402
To put the signs on the street side,
where they belong.

45:24.050 --> 45:28.168
See how long she stays by his side
when he has no business.

45:28.720 --> 45:30.802
Wendy Davis Byrde.

45:30.890 --> 45:33.518
Woman can't even commit
to one name.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.340
Come back in the house, Mom, okay?

45:35.440 --> 45:38.102
Let's just talk it out, 'cause I don't
wanna fight anymore. All right?

45:38.190 --> 45:40.511
You think you'd even have a job
if it wasn't for me?

45:40.610 --> 45:42.146
You think you'd sell any houses?

45:42.230 --> 45:44.391
And you know we don't put the signs
on the street anymore.

45:44.490 --> 45:46.731
We put 'em on the lake side now.
You know that.

45:46.820 --> 45:48.560
_llWell?
-Okay, me.

45:48.660 --> 45:50.787
I don't put the signs
on the street anymore.

45:50.870 --> 45:52.690
"We don't put signs on the street."

45:52.790 --> 45:54.326
Boy, you can't even think for yourself.

45:54.410 --> 45:57.868
Okay, that's enough. 'Cause I think
you're being childish, how about that?

45:57.960 --> 45:59.575
-Oh, I'm being childish?
-Yeah.

45:59.670 --> 46:02.833
Well, I am not listening
to your foolishness anymore.

46:02.920 --> 46:05.218
-La,la,la,la.
-Oh, you're really doing this right now?

46:05.300 --> 46:07.962
Seriously? Mom? Mom, get out of the way.
Mom, get out of the road!

46:16.640 --> 46:19.222
Would you stop worrying?
I'll call you when it's done.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.062
--He's here.

46:21.940 --> 46:22.929
Coming.

46:26.530 --> 46:27.519
Hey.

46:32.990 --> 46:34.287
I have a surprise.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.650
- You ready?

46:40.540 --> 46:42.747
-What is this?
-I made it.

46:43.250 --> 46:44.376
Well, me and Kinko's.

46:45.340 --> 46:46.500
For our place.

46:47.380 --> 46:49.336
I called the place Fly Life.

46:50.260 --> 46:51.636
I can change it if you want, but...

46:51.720 --> 46:54.177
--...I think it's a pretty cool name.

46:54.260 --> 46:56.842
"Caters to the high-end spin ﬁsherman

46:56.930 --> 46:59.933
who won't settle
for anything but the best."

47:02.650 --> 47:06.529
We'll have Pflueger open face reels.
Simms lug sole waders.

47:06.610 --> 47:09.272
Brass and nickel bodies and blades.

47:09.950 --> 47:11.611
--Turn it over.

47:14.950 --> 47:18.499
"Co-founders Robert Powell
and Russ Langmore."

47:22.460 --> 47:24.530
Your name should come first, you know.

47:25.340 --> 47:26.659
Alphabetical order.

47:28.010 --> 47:29.830
This whole thing was your idea.

47:33.050 --> 47:36.804
- Yeah.
- Anyway, you wanted to talk.

47:36.890 --> 47:37.879
What?

47:40.020 --> 47:43.148
You called me, remember?

47:44.440 --> 47:48.524
I just... wanted to see you, is all.

48:35.780 --> 48:37.828
Preacher did the right thing.

48:38.620 --> 48:40.952
- Look at this guy here.

48:41.870 --> 48:45.124
Ash said he sat there
for a good, long time.

48:45.710 --> 48:48.042
Then when Byrde left, he followed.

48:48.630 --> 48:50.916
Someone's watching Byrde, Jacob.

48:51.010 --> 48:55.754
I don't want to wait
for someone else to kill him.

48:56.800 --> 49:00.349
- My hotheaded bride.

49:00.890 --> 49:03.723
I mean, nothing's gone right for us
since he's been here.

49:03.810 --> 49:07.553
-Now he's outed us to the preacher?
-Who will go back on the water.

49:08.270 --> 49:10.272
Our lives are different, Jacob.

49:11.860 --> 49:13.737
Starlings spread diseases

49:13.820 --> 49:15.947
in both humans and livestock

49:16.030 --> 49:19.022
and cost up to $800 million a year
to treat.

49:19.830 --> 49:22.867
They're on the list
of the world's worst invaders.

49:26.210 --> 49:27.325
-Daddy?
-Charlotte?

49:28.210 --> 49:29.495
-You okay?
-Yeah.

49:29.590 --> 49:30.625
Hmm?

49:33.050 --> 49:34.620
I'm sorry I scared you.

49:35.130 --> 49:37.837
Well, you're home.
That's all I care about.

49:38.760 --> 49:41.308
- You all right? You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Um...

49:41.930 --> 49:44.512
- Can I go for a swim?
- I'll talk better after.

49:44.600 --> 49:47.057
A swim? Isn't it freezing outside?

49:47.150 --> 49:48.686
I'll wear my suit. I'll be fine.

49:50.110 --> 49:52.772
All right, just out to the first buoy,
that's it, okay?

49:52.860 --> 49:54.270
-A short one.
-Okay.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.149
So, how is she?

50:05.710 --> 50:07.951
She's depressed, lonely and anxious.

50:08.580 --> 50:10.628
We've really fucked up, Marty.

50:10.710 --> 50:14.749
I think she just needs some familiar,
sort of connective tissue, right?

50:14.840 --> 50:17.001
Maybe we can convince her
to try the swim team again.

50:17.090 --> 50:19.638
No, we are way past
any point of assimilation here.

50:21.220 --> 50:22.596
We took her life away.

50:23.430 --> 50:25.591
Everything she thought was safe is a lie.

50:31.730 --> 50:33.778
We'll look deeper for what's here.

50:33.860 --> 50:35.816
I know what's here. Trust me.

50:35.900 --> 50:37.891
It's the shit you run away from.

50:38.450 --> 50:41.908
It's pickups and warm beer
and low expectations.

50:41.990 --> 50:44.481
It's grown men
with bourbon on their breath,

50:44.580 --> 50:47.151
who lean in a little too close and say,
"My, how you've grown."

50:47.250 --> 50:49.457
All right, do you have any suggestions
what we might do?

50:49.540 --> 50:51.531
Yeah. She needs to go back to Chicago.

50:51.630 --> 50:53.291
-Not an option.
-Jonah needs to go with her.

50:53.380 --> 50:56.463
-Please. We're not sending our kids away.
-Marty, they need a life.

50:56.550 --> 50:58.836
They need to stay with us. Just forget it.

50:58.930 --> 51:01.672
I've spoken to Coach Daniels
and her spot is still available

51:01.760 --> 51:03.466
-on the swim team, and Mr. Oakes...
-You what?

51:03.560 --> 51:05.380
...he wants Jonah to be part
of the science decathlon

51:05.470 --> 51:07.017
-now that he's in middle--
-Hang on a sec.

51:07.100 --> 51:10.809
You talked to both of them
without talking to me ﬁrst?

51:12.190 --> 51:13.851
I'm just trying to do what's right.

51:13.940 --> 51:16.852
While excluding me from the process?
What's the matter with you?

51:16.940 --> 51:19.192
You said that _
we're busmess partners, right?

51:19.280 --> 51:20.349
-Yeah.
-Right? Well,

51:20.450 --> 51:22.065
sometimes business partners disagree.

51:22.160 --> 51:24.196
Caitlin's mom said
that she would house them.

51:24.280 --> 51:26.282
Hang on. You trying to teach them
your little trick?

51:26.370 --> 51:28.031
When shit gets hot, you pack up and run?

51:28.120 --> 51:30.111
Oh, fuck you, Marty!

51:30.210 --> 51:33.031
Let me tell you something.
Any of us run, we're dead.

51:33.130 --> 51:35.086
-So forget it.
-Hey, Marty, look around!

51:35.170 --> 51:37.377
This place is death.

51:37.960 --> 51:41.179
Jonah, he's dragging dead animals
around with their guts falling out.

51:41.260 --> 51:43.137
He wants to shoot birds out of the sky!

51:43.220 --> 51:46.212
There was a corpse
that came up to our dock,

51:46.310 --> 51:50.383
and in our basement, right now,
there is an old man dying as we speak.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.641
Let me ask you a question.
How long before you follow them?

51:52.730 --> 51:53.890
To Chicago. How long?

51:53.980 --> 51:55.766
-We're not talking about me.
-The fuck we're not.

51:55.860 --> 51:58.101
This is another betrayal.
How long you been planning this?

51:58.610 --> 51:59.986
- Tell me.
- Hey, look.

52:00.070 --> 52:02.447
I have done nothing since I've been here
except support you,

52:02.530 --> 52:04.987
and I've been saving this family
over and over again.

52:05.070 --> 52:06.446
Great. Wendy's here, everybody.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.360
-We're safe now.
-Oh, great. Shut up, Marty,

52:08.450 --> 52:09.997
before you say something
you can't take back.

52:10.080 --> 52:14.119
No. Let's say exactly what we feel, Wendy.
Right now, let's be honest.

52:14.210 --> 52:17.122
Let's do it. Can you do it?
Or are you just a deceitful bitch?

52:18.000 --> 52:20.048
-Wow.
-Let's have it.

52:20.130 --> 52:22.178
You wanna...
You wanna talk about betrayal? Really?

52:22.260 --> 52:24.216
You wanna go there? Okay.

52:24.300 --> 52:27.804
You have a video on your computer of me.

52:30.520 --> 52:31.930
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

52:32.440 --> 52:36.262
That's just a confirmation
of exactly who you are.

52:36.360 --> 52:38.351
You've been watching it for months.

52:38.440 --> 52:41.944
There's a counter on that thing
and you have watched it 27 times.

52:42.030 --> 52:44.487
You think I wanted to see that
even once, Wendy?

52:44.570 --> 52:46.652
If you knew, why didn't you confront me?

52:46.740 --> 52:48.788
--And what would I say?

52:48.870 --> 52:50.861
Anything! Anything at all.

52:52.580 --> 52:54.912
Instead of pushing all of those
emotions down, distancing yourself

52:55.000 --> 52:56.331
-from anything you feel.
-Hang on--

52:56.420 --> 52:58.627
Do not change the subject to me
'cause we're talking about you.

52:58.710 --> 53:01.873
-We're talking about that.
-You have walled me out!

53:01.970 --> 53:03.870
-Wendy, we're talking about you...
-But Bruce?

53:03.970 --> 53:06.086
-You've never talked to me...
-...and how you lived a lie

53:06.180 --> 53:07.886
-every goddamn night.
-...about how he betrayed you.

53:07.970 --> 53:11.383
Every night you came home to this family,
you were living a fuckin' lie.

53:11.480 --> 53:13.880
How do you do that? I don't get it.

53:13.980 --> 53:16.767
I don't understand how you did that.
Explain it to me.

53:18.610 --> 53:20.680
You slapped my ass, Marty.

53:21.820 --> 53:24.812
Yeah, I slapped your ass
because I thought that you liked it.

53:24.900 --> 53:26.731
Oh, that is such bullshit

53:26.820 --> 53:29.573
-and you know it. You are full of shit.
-Why is it bullshit

53:29.660 --> 53:31.992
that I would want to do something
you might like?

53:34.330 --> 53:37.288
...about what you might like, I ended up
doing exactly what your lover did.

53:37.380 --> 53:38.916
-Stop it!
-That's fuckin' bullshit.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.252
Do you know how many times
you could've said no to that guy?

53:41.340 --> 53:44.548
You could've said no
the first drink that he bought you.

53:44.630 --> 53:45.619
Right?

53:45.720 --> 53:46.709
-Stop.
-You could've said no

53:46.800 --> 53:48.597
when he asked for your number,
but you didn't.

53:48.680 --> 53:51.763
You could've said no the first
goddamn motel room that you booked.

53:51.850 --> 53:54.341
Or the first time he stuck his fuckin'
tongue down your throat.

53:54.430 --> 53:57.513
Right? Or the fuckin' first time
he slapped your ass.

53:57.600 --> 53:59.932
Why would I say no, Marty? Why?

54:00.020 --> 54:03.433
Who was I saving
myself for? Intimacy from you?

54:03.780 --> 54:06.271
-I don't know.
-Any affection from you?

54:06.570 --> 54:08.276
-Well, you didn't, did you?
-You shut me out

54:08.370 --> 54:11.612
the minute we decided to launder
the stupid fucking money.

54:12.830 --> 54:16.914
-Well, maybe I was trying to protect you.
-I didn't want protection! I wanted you.

54:18.380 --> 54:20.166
I wanted you, you idiot.

54:25.130 --> 54:26.620
Why do you even want me here?

54:27.470 --> 54:28.755
Necessity.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.097
Not desire.

54:35.600 --> 54:38.478
Why didn't you let Del kill me
when he had the chance?

54:43.150 --> 54:47.644
Oh, what? What? No dry, witty comeback?

54:49.110 --> 54:50.907
No more truth? Okay.

54:51.580 --> 54:54.196
All right, Marty.

54:54.290 --> 54:56.747
Why don't you just
tell me the fuckin' truth?

54:56.830 --> 54:58.070
Just tell me the truth.

54:58.870 --> 55:01.498
Oh, you broke my heart, Wendy.
