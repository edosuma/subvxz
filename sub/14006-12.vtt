Previously on <i>Damages</i>

00:03.600 --> 00:04.900
I-I don't know how to tell you this.

00:04.900 --> 00:06.600
Somehow Ellen's in jail.

00:06.700 --> 00:08.700
She was arrested for killing David.

00:08.900 --> 00:10.300
David doesn't love you anymore.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.800
I've been sleeping with him.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.200
Clearly the woman is nuts.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.400
There's always a solution.

00:15.400 --> 00:16.400
What kind of a solution?

00:16.900 --> 00:17.700
A permanent one.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.000
My name is Gregory Malina,

00:19.100 --> 00:20.700
and I want to make 
sure my story gets out.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.900
I got a letter from Greg Malina.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.400
It's over, Art.

00:24.500 --> 00:27.000
The photos link Ray Fiske 
to Gregory Malina,

00:27.000 --> 00:29.900
and the documents prove that 
Fiske's guilty of insider trading.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.100
You should be able to use that.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.600
You can have your job back.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.400
I don't want it.

00:34.700 --> 00:35.600
Gregory?

00:36.700 --> 00:38.500
You're blackmailing me, Patty.

00:38.600 --> 00:39.400
I'm sorry.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.600
We really have to wear these 
for the rest of our lives?

00:48.700 --> 00:50.600
It's kind of terrifying, huh?

00:53.200 --> 00:54.000
I don't know

00:55.500 --> 00:57.300
Maybe we are 
making a big mistake

00:58.300 --> 00:59.600
Excuse me?

01:00.900 --> 01:03.100
About the....rings

01:03.800 --> 01:05.500
Maybe we should've gone gold.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.700
What are you smiling at?

01:18.500 --> 01:20.700
We are gonna have sex 
even when you're bald.

01:25.700 --> 01:26.600
Bald?

01:27.200 --> 01:28.200
No way.

01:29.100 --> 01:30.500
I'm going toupee all the way.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.200
No don't.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.900
- Why?
- Its padlocked.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.300
We should put them away, 
you're making me nervous.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.700
We should lock them up

01:48.500 --> 01:49.900
didn't know its **

01:51.000 --> 01:52.200
Who's gonna take them?

01:53.100 --> 01:54.700
No one if they're hidden.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.800
Please babe, just put my mind at ease.

01:59.000 --> 01:59.700
All right.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.200
Do you have your key?

02:02.800 --> 02:03.900
It's on the desk.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.600
Put them in our hiding place.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.500
Hello?

02:23.200 --> 02:24.100
What's wrong?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
I'll be there right away.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.000
Who was that?

02:32.700 --> 02:33.700
It was my sister.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.400
She's in the Village.
They had another fight.

02:41.200 --> 02:41.800
Patty?

02:43.000 --> 02:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.500 --> 02:57.500
He shot himself.

02:59.900 --> 03:00.900
I need your help.

03:01.900 --> 03:03.300
Have you called the police?

03:03.400 --> 03:04.000
Not yet.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.000
Who else knows about this?

03:08.800 --> 03:09.500
Just us.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.400
Take this.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.600
Put it somewhere safe.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.400
No one can ever know 
what he was doing here.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.200
I understand.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.900
Not even David.

03:36.100 --> 03:36.700
Ellen?

03:40.600 --> 03:41.900
I can trust you?

03:44.300 --> 03:45.100
Yes.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.500
* When I am through with you *

04:13.900 --> 04:16.800
* There won't be anything left *

04:17.399 --> 04:20.500
* When I am through with you *

04:20.899 --> 04:24.000
* There won't be anything left *

04:24.400 --> 04:28.300
* When I am through with you. * 

04:36.700 --> 04:37.500
Parsons.

04:37.900 --> 04:38.800
Got a roommate.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.100
What's a matter, rich girl?

04:48.400 --> 04:49.900
Daddy won't post bail?

04:50.400 --> 04:51.500
Lower bunk's mine.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.100
Bitch, don't even.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.000
I ripped off a convenience store

04:55.000 --> 04:57.200
and a bodega before they busted my ass.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.500
I killed my fiancÃ©.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.500
Babe?

05:27.300 --> 05:27.900
Hey!

05:28.500 --> 05:29.000
Hey.

05:32.300 --> 05:33.400
How's your sister?

05:34.200 --> 05:35.800
Oh, she's fine.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.900
You know, Carrie... it's always a crisis.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.200
You're leaving?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.400
Yeah, I just got called in.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.400
I'm gonna see you later. Okay?

05:42.500 --> 05:43.300
Okay. Hey.

05:45.300 --> 05:46.300
I love you.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.700
I love you, too.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.000
How do you know Raymond Fiske?

05:58.200 --> 05:59.000
Patty?

06:01.300 --> 06:03.900
We were opposing counsel on a case.

06:04.900 --> 06:07.900
Is it common practice to 
conduct business this late?

06:08.100 --> 06:10.800
Ray called me at the last minute,

06:10.800 --> 06:13.000
he said he needed to see me urgently.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.200
What happened when he got here?

06:16.100 --> 06:19.000
He'd proposed a settlement offer.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.100
When I told him that

06:21.100 --> 06:23.500
my clients didn't accept it, he got upset.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.700
Did he threaten you?

06:25.100 --> 06:25.800
No.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.600
He just got up and left. I... 

06:29.900 --> 06:32.200
I-I thought the meeting was over.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.700
But then he came back and, um...

06:40.900 --> 06:41.600
did it.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.400
There are no powder 
burns on the woman.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.100
Blood spatter, angle of the 
trajectory, position of the body.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.800
This was a suicide.

06:53.100 --> 06:53.700
Okay.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.200
Can I take her home now?

06:58.700 --> 06:59.500
Yes.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.200
You're free to go, Ms. Hewes.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.200
But we'd like you to stay available 
in case we have any other questions.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.400
Of course.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.200
Hello?

07:20.200 --> 07:22.300
What? No, slow-slow down. What...

07:25.200 --> 07:26.700
You're... What?

07:28.200 --> 07:29.000
Where?

07:31.300 --> 07:32.200
Well...

07:33.100 --> 07:34.100
Jesus Christ.

07:34.100 --> 07:35.600
How long have you been 
standing out there?

07:37.200 --> 07:39.500
No, no, hold on. Hold on a second.

07:40.600 --> 07:41.500
Jesus.

07:45.800 --> 07:49.000
Arthur, these are Detectives Wright 
and Fleming.They have a few questions

07:49.000 --> 07:49.900
they need to ask you.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.400
Nah, excuse me. But where-where's Ray?

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
Why don't we come inside.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.500
Nah, where...

07:54.500 --> 07:55.600
This is about Ray.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.700
What do you mean? 
What happened?

07:58.500 --> 08:00.000
Last night, he took his own life.

08:03.300 --> 08:07.100
We have reason to believe that
they were meeting to discuss 
your latest settlement offer.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.700
That's entirely possible.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.700
We're in negotiations.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.400
Were you aware that there was 
a meeting scheduled for last night?

08:15.200 --> 08:16.800
No. No, I wasn't.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.700
Has Mallory been told?

08:20.900 --> 08:22.000
Amos is there now.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.000
We should be with her.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.400
Mr. Frobisher, um,

08:30.300 --> 08:32.299
when was the last time that 
you spoke to Mr. Fiske?

08:33.500 --> 08:35.100
Yesterday on the phone.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.600
George Moore is dead.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.000
I heard.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.500
I don't even really remember 
what we were talking about.

08:46.500 --> 08:50.300
Some... probably details 
about the, uh, the case.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.900
Did Mr. Fiske give any indication 
that he was distressed or...?

08:57.000 --> 08:57.700
No.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.000
It's over, Art.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.600
What is?

09:03.500 --> 09:06.000
Are you aware of anything 
in Mr. Fiske's life

09:06.000 --> 09:08.100
that could have driven 
him to take this action?

09:10.100 --> 09:12.100
No. No, there was nothing.

09:21.800 --> 09:22.600
You all right?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.100
I'm fine.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.600
Why did he do it?

09:32.200 --> 09:33.100
I don't know.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.400
Must have been horrible.

09:37.900 --> 09:38.700
I'm sorry.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.200
I want you to shut down the office.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.600
Send everyone home for a few days.

09:46.900 --> 09:47.600
Okay.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.000
There's going to be a 
hearing with Judge Toomey.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.400
I want you to take it.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.600
I'll, uh, I'll-I'll handle it.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.200
I'll be gone for a while.

09:59.900 --> 10:00.600
Sure.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Anything you need.

10:04.000 --> 10:04.800
Thanks, Tom.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.100
Come on, boy. Come on. o

10:14.500 --> 10:16.000
I think I should cancel my flight.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.700
Aw, Phil, go to your conference.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.600
Not if Michael's going upstate 
tonight with Henry's family.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.400
I'm happy to bail, Mom.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.300
Henry and I can go up anytimewe want.

10:26.300 --> 10:29.400
No, no, I don't want you two 
changing your plans.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.800
Patty, you shouldn't be alone.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.600
I prefer to be alone.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.200
Really.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.200
You sure?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.700
You know I'd tell you otherwise.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.100
I want to go to the beach house.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.800
I want to get away.

11:42.800 --> 11:46.700
I knew Ray Fiske well over 20 years.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.000
He was a great lawyer.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.700
and a friend.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.000
we are all devastated, Your Honor.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.700
You have my sympathies.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.300
Something like this happens,

11:58.000 --> 11:59.400
it gives us all pause.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.500
Needless to say, 
we've been forced to regroup.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.800
New attorneys are just beginning

12:05.800 --> 12:08.300
to familiarize themselves 
with Mr. Frobisher's case.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.500
I appreciate that.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.500
The trial was set for the 
end of next month

12:12.500 --> 12:15.600
and I see you're requesting 
a six-month extension.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.600
Mr. Shayes?

12:18.400 --> 12:22.000
Well, first of all, let me express 
my condolences to the entire firm.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.800
We respect the difficult position 
Mr. Phillips finds himself in.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.200
We understand the challenge 
of getting new team members up to speed, but...

12:32.100 --> 12:36.000
our responsibilities lie with 
Mr. Frobisher's 5,000 employees

12:36.000 --> 12:37.900
who can't pay their bills.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.700
For them, justice delayed is truly...

12:40.700 --> 12:42.200
I'd have to agree, Mr. Phillips.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.500
You have a proposed order?

12:44.900 --> 12:46.400
A one-month continuance.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.100
Mr. Phillips, the court 
empathizes with your position.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
Thank you, Your Honor.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.900
But after one month, we press on.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.500
Ray left something for you.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.400
It's on the desk.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.300
Take your time, Arthur.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.200
Thank you.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.300
Hey.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.300
Ray Fiske killed himself last night.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.900
It's all over the news.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.500
PARSO

14:59.200 --> 15:00.400
David, what is it?

15:02.200 --> 15:04.600
Your sister called to 
see how you were doing.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.400
She said she hasn't 
spoken to you in three weeks.

15:11.200 --> 15:11.700
David...

15:11.700 --> 15:13.100
Where were you last night?

15:24.800 --> 15:26.800
You told me that you were fired.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.500
I was, but Patty needed 
me to meet with George Moore.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.900
You didn't think that you should tell me?

15:30.900 --> 15:32.100
I didn't want you involved.

15:32.300 --> 15:33.300
These people are dangerous.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.600
I thought the less that 
you knew, the better.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.300
This information that you 
got from George Moore...

15:37.300 --> 15:40.400
Shows that Ray Fiske is 
part of the whole conspiracy.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.900
So Patty used it as 
leverage against Fiske.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.400
Is that why he killed himself?

15:46.200 --> 15:47.100
I don't know.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.500
Patty was blackmailing him.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.100
- Fiske was guilty of corruption.
- Enough, Ellen!ot...

15:52.100 --> 15:53.100
David, listen,

15:53.700 --> 15:56.100
these men killed Gregory Malina.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.100
They probably killed George Moore.

15:58.300 --> 16:02.100
They do whatever the hell they want,
and they'll keep doing it until 
somebody stops them.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.700
Frobisher has to take responsibility.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.900
Winning this case is the only way 
that that is going to happen.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.800
And then what?

16:09.400 --> 16:10.200
What do you mean?

16:10.300 --> 16:11.900
Are you going to go back to Patty?

16:12.400 --> 16:15.100
This is the kind of work 
that I want to do, David.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.800
Patty may be a horrible person, but...

16:19.500 --> 16:20.900
these guys are ruthless.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.400
I don't know what you 
are doing anymore.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.700
I know exactly what I'm doing.

16:26.900 --> 16:27.500
Really?

16:28.100 --> 16:29.600
A man's dead now. 
Was that the plan?

16:29.700 --> 16:32.300
You of all people should understand 
after what they did to Katie.

16:32.300 --> 16:35.100
I don't care about them; I care about us.

16:35.100 --> 16:36.200
This is what it takes.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.600
I don't want this life.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.500
Someone has to hold 
these guys accountable.

16:39.500 --> 16:43.300
You decide right now-- do you 
want us or do you want this job?

16:45.100 --> 16:46.900
- Please don't do this.
- Right now.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.500
Right now!

16:55.000 --> 16:56.500
You can't decide, can you?

16:56.700 --> 16:57.900
- David... 
- No.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.300
We're done, Ellen.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.200
Hello?

17:32.100 --> 17:34.200
Stop, stop it, just stop. Listen to me.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.100
Damn it, will you just-- no!

17:36.200 --> 17:39.800
Lila, you need to stop calling me!

17:47.900 --> 17:49.200
I'm sorry to disturb you.

17:49.700 --> 17:50.600
What do you want?

17:50.900 --> 17:54.100
Well, one of your neighbors called and
said they heard a bit of a commotion earlier.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.700
I just wanted to make 
sure you two are all right.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.600
Yeah, we're fine.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.400
Is your fiancÃ©e here?

18:01.700 --> 18:02.700
She went out.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.600
But everything's okay?

18:05.100 --> 18:06.000
We're great.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.500
- Have a nice night.
- Hey, you, too.

18:33.900 --> 18:36.600
- Malina made a goddamn videotape.
- Where is it?

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
I don't know, I don't know,
but right now that tape is my life.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.900
When he came back into the country, 
Malina went to the chef.

18:44.600 --> 18:45.700
Katie Connor?

18:46.400 --> 18:48.200
D-Do you still have people on her?

18:48.400 --> 18:49.200
Of course.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.500
All right, all right, good, 
good, good, all right.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.400
Just do anything you have to do,

18:54.400 --> 18:55.700
but get me that tape.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.000
Hey, it's me.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.900
I... I'm so sorry.

18:59.900 --> 19:03.400
Just please call me back.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.200
Okay?

19:07.400 --> 19:08.900
Jsus Christ.ri

19:15.600 --> 19:16.400
Katie.

19:17.000 --> 19:17.800
Can I come in?

19:18.600 --> 19:19.600
Of course.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.400
I just saw Ellen go.
She seemed upset.Is everything okay?

19:23.800 --> 19:26.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.200
Good.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.400
Y-You're back in town? 
Y-You didn't call.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.500
What are you doing here?

19:33.300 --> 19:34.100
What is this?

19:34.400 --> 19:35.600
Gregory left it with me.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.800
Give it to Ellen. 
She needs to see this.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.100
Okay.

19:42.700 --> 19:43.600
I gotta go.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.600
Wait a minute. That's it?

19:45.800 --> 19:47.800
Y-You're leaving? 
I haven't seen you in months.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.700
I don't want to be here 
when she gets back.

19:50.900 --> 19:51.900
I'll call you tomorrow.

21:35.200 --> 21:35.800
Hey.

21:37.000 --> 21:37.700
Tom.

21:39.100 --> 21:40.000
You okay?

21:40.100 --> 21:44.100
Yeah, I... I just came by 
to grab some stuff.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.700
I thought it would be better 
when no one was around.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.700
You heard about Fiske?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.500
Yeah, it's awful.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.700
Doing it in front of Patty.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.900
How is she doing?

21:58.300 --> 21:59.500
She's pretty shaken up.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.400
Have you seen her since 
she, uh, let you go?

22:07.100 --> 22:08.900
I don't think Patty wants to see me.

22:12.500 --> 22:13.800
Yeah, what you said was pretty...

22:13.800 --> 22:14.600
Stupid?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.200
I was going to say ballsy,

22:17.300 --> 22:19.800
but, uh, yeah, stupid... stupid works.

22:22.500 --> 22:25.200
So, uh, you know, we should... we should 
get some coffee sometime.

22:26.100 --> 22:27.600
Yeah, I'd like that.

22:30.200 --> 22:30.900
Okay.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.100
- Take care.
- You, too.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.500
- Who is it?
- Mallory Fiske.

22:49.700 --> 22:50.800
Oh, shit.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.500
Ray was medicated, you know.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.500
For the last several years.

23:08.700 --> 23:10.200
He could just get...

23:12.400 --> 23:14.100
so depressed sometimes.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.200
Hey, do you want a...?

23:16.700 --> 23:17.900
Do you wanta drink?

23:18.900 --> 23:20.500
- No, no thank you.
- No?

23:22.400 --> 23:23.700
Well, he probably

23:24.600 --> 23:27.800
obligated to solve his problems.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.300
You know Ray.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.700
He'd bend over backwards to help 
someone he cared about,

23:33.300 --> 23:35.800
but God forbid any of us 
should worry about him.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.200
God forbid, right?

23:38.800 --> 23:40.400
How was the case going?

23:43.400 --> 23:44.300
Well.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.500
Exceptionally well.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.200
Arthur, the night Ray, uh...

23:51.300 --> 23:55.000
He... told me to pack my bags.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.900
Said he wanted to leave the country.

24:00.900 --> 24:01.800
He said that?

24:02.500 --> 24:03.200
Why?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.100
I don't know.

24:07.100 --> 24:09.500
But, Arthur, if this had 
anything to do with the case...

24:09.500 --> 24:11.800
No, no, no, no. 
I-I would have known that.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.400
Maybe if I'd understood him, I could have...

24:25.400 --> 24:26.900
Why did he do it?

24:28.700 --> 24:31.500
Arthur, you knew him better than anyone.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.600
Mallory, you were married to him.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.900
I mean, if you... if you don't know 
why he did this, no one does.

24:47.300 --> 24:48.900
Hey, I'm-I'm, uh...

24:49.200 --> 24:51.400
- Oh, sure. I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.600
- I'm so sorry to take your time.
- No, no, no, no,

24:53.600 --> 24:55.100
no, no, it's me.

24:55.100 --> 24:57.300
Uh, can you just hold on one second?

24:58.300 --> 25:00.300
Listen, wait, wait. 
Hold on, hold on, Mallory.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.900
Look, you know, 
don't-don't beat yourself up.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.800
You can't blame yourself.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.200
You know what I mean?

25:09.900 --> 25:10.700
Good night.

25:13.700 --> 25:14.500
Yeah.

25:14.900 --> 25:16.500
Yeah, no. Good. Send 'em up.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.300
Ah, yeah.

25:21.500 --> 25:22.400
Ah!

25:24.900 --> 25:25.900
Ah!

25:28.600 --> 25:29.800
Oh, Jesus...

25:59.900 --> 26:01.700
- Good evening, Miss Parsons. 
- Good evening, Perry.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.000
- Go right up.
- Thank you.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.400
Yes.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.000
He called off the engagement?

26:16.300 --> 26:18.100
I'm so sorry, Ellen.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.600
Maybe we went too far.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.100
Do you regret what we did?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.100
Because I do.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.000
You do?

26:47.100 --> 26:48.300
We crossed a line.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.100
How could we know that Ray...?

27:07.900 --> 27:09.900
Is the folder in a safe place?

27:11.100 --> 27:12.000
It's locked up...

27:12.500 --> 27:13.800
in my apartment.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.200
We'll deal with it on 
Monday morning.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.800
While I'm gone, you're 
welcome to stay here.

27:25.900 --> 27:27.300
The guest room's all made up.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.000
Thank you.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.300
You and David can work this out.

27:34.100 --> 27:39.000
I wouldn't be surprised if you were 
together again by the time I get back.

27:54.600 --> 27:58.200
Shortly after, Mr. Fiske sent me to 
Florida to help set up a meeting.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.700
I didn't know what this meeting was about,

28:01.200 --> 28:03.100
but I know that Arthur Frobisher 

28:03.300 --> 28:07.000
was in contact with a member of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.700
The name of that member is...

28:10.700 --> 28:11.800
George Moore.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.000
If anything happens to me,

28:14.700 --> 28:17.300
George Moore and Arthur Frobisher 
are responsible.

28:35.100 --> 28:38.700
So, there's bourbon in the kitchen, 
and remember to walk Corey.

28:39.800 --> 28:40.700
Where can I reach you?

28:40.800 --> 28:43.000
I'll be at the beach house. 
Tom has the number.

28:43.700 --> 28:46.200
Storm cleared Montauk last night. 
Should be a perfect weekend.

28:46.300 --> 28:47.400
Thank you, Perry.

28:47.700 --> 28:51.200
Ellen, everything's going to be all right.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.300
Hey, Ellen, Ellen, it's me.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.800
Look, there's something here 
that you really got to see.

29:06.200 --> 29:10.100
Katie brought you a video-tape 
that Gregory Malina made.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.500
It's about the case.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.400
Gregory confessed everything 
about what happened in Florida.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.600
Look, I got the early shift,
but I'm going to leave it in our hiding place, okay?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.900
- Shit!
- Hey.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.100
You scared me.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.000
Sorry.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.100
Where's my mom?

30:52.400 --> 30:54.800
She went to the beach house.
She said I could stay here.

30:54.900 --> 30:55.600
Cool.

30:55.900 --> 30:57.700
I'm just grabbing some stuff.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.700
Don't tell my mom you saw me.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Sure.

31:08.400 --> 31:12.000
If anyone asks, I wasn't here.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.200
- I'm sorry, David.
- Ellen?

32:04.700 --> 32:05.600
Jesus.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.600
- Ellen's gone.
- What are you doing here?

32:08.800 --> 32:10.800
- I'll run you a bath.
- Just get out of here.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.000
David, will you...?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.800
- Enough of this shit.
- Don't do this.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.300
Just get out!

32:15.900 --> 32:17.100
You don't know what we had.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.600
I'm calling the police.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.900
You really should lock your door.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.200
Tom.

32:50.300 --> 32:53.300
Jesus! Patty, where the 
hell have you been?

32:55.300 --> 32:56.400
Visiting family.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.200
Well, you need to get back here.

32:59.700 --> 33:01.400
Ellen thinks you tried to kill her.

33:04.500 --> 33:05.100
Patty?

33:07.700 --> 33:08.400
Patty?

33:09.600 --> 33:10.800
I'm coming home.

33:25.900 --> 33:26.800
Parsons.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.400
School's out early.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.000
What's going on?

33:30.500 --> 33:31.700
Your bail was posted.

33:33.400 --> 33:34.200
By who?

33:34.500 --> 33:36.400
You know a Patricia Hewes?

33:42.000 --> 33:45.200
All right, sweetheart, 
all you've got is a set of keys.

33:45.700 --> 33:48.700
And your attorney sent you a 
change of clothes. Sign right here.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.900
Oh, maybe I should go in 
and get your things, huh?

34:41.900 --> 34:43.500
No. Thanks.

34:43.900 --> 34:45.600
I think I just want to be alone for a while.

35:08.100 --> 35:09.600
You really should lock your door.

35:21.900 --> 35:22.800
Where is it?

35:23.200 --> 35:24.400
Where's the videotape?

35:25.800 --> 35:26.900
Check the bedroom.

35:58.000 --> 35:58.800
What have you got?

36:13.300 --> 36:14.200
Bring him in here.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.800
Where... is the goddamn videotape?

36:34.100 --> 36:36.200
I don't know.

36:40.000 --> 36:40.700
All right.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
I think I got something.

38:14.700 --> 38:16.300
Jesus Christ.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.600
What about the tape?

38:19.800 --> 38:20.600
It wasn't there.

38:21.100 --> 38:21.700
What?

38:22.200 --> 38:23.900
So we went to Patty Hewes' apartment.

38:26.100 --> 38:26.800
And?

38:29.100 --> 38:30.500
Things got a little fouled up.

38:31.500 --> 38:34.200
What the hell is that supposed to mean, 
"things got a little bit fouled up"?

38:34.300 --> 38:35.800
Let's just say we didn't find the tape.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.600
Where the hell have you been?

39:07.100 --> 39:08.200
Ellen...

39:09.600 --> 39:11.300
no matter what you think,

39:12.200 --> 39:15.100
I didn't have anything to 
do with any of this.

39:16.900 --> 39:17.800
I know.

39:19.900 --> 39:23.400
But Tom told me that you 
accused me of trying to kill you.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.400
How else was I supposed 
to get you back here?

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
So this videotape... implicates Frobisher?

39:33.300 --> 39:34.000
Yes.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.900
You have one new message.

39:41.900 --> 39:42.800
Ellen, it's me.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.000
Katie brought you a 
videotape that Gregory Malina made.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.400
I'm going to leave it in 
our hiding place, okay?

39:51.000 --> 39:53.400
That's why Frobisher 
had someone try to find it.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.800
But Frobisher's people 
didn't find the tape in my apartment.

39:59.300 --> 40:00.900
So they went to mine.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.200
But they didn't know that I would be there.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.600
That's when they tried to kill you.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.600
If they never found the tape, where is it?

40:17.600 --> 40:19.800
I have it. It's safe.

40:20.800 --> 40:21.500
Good.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.700
- Then we...
- There's no "we" anymore.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.400
I've had some time to 
think over the past few days.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.800
The only reason you hired 
me was to get to Katie.

40:30.800 --> 40:31.900
- Ellen... 
- Don't bother.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.500
I had that figured out pretty early actually,

40:34.500 --> 40:36.500
but then you had Tom 
convince me otherwise,

40:36.800 --> 40:38.600
and I was stupid 
enough to believe him.

40:39.500 --> 40:43.400
At the time, I didn't realize he's a scared, weak, liar
who would do anything to please you.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.900
- I would never...
- Bullshit.

40:46.700 --> 40:48.500
And then you tried to break up me and David,

40:48.500 --> 40:52.000
you trashed Katie as a witness,
and you fired me for no good reason.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.300
But you did teach me one valuable lesson.

40:57.700 --> 40:58.800
I'm glad.

41:02.800 --> 41:03.800
"Trust no one."

41:07.100 --> 41:08.800
Well, I don't anymore, Patty.

41:10.500 --> 41:11.900
Least of all you.

41:15.900 --> 41:17.100
I see.

41:18.600 --> 41:19.600
I'll give you the tape...

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
but you're going to do 
something for me first.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.100
What?

41:26.400 --> 41:27.500
Be my lawyer.

41:28.300 --> 41:30.900
I've been accused of murder and 
you're going to exonerate me.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.100
I need your power and your connections.

41:35.400 --> 41:38.800
Clear me of this, and then 
help me find who killed David.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.500
If you do that...

41:42.800 --> 41:44.200
then I'll give you the tape.

42:00.800 --> 42:02.800
Ellen Parsons is out on bail.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.200
You know where to find her.

42:06.305 --> 42:12.532
