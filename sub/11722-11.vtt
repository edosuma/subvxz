00:00.112 --> 00:01.913
Previously on
"the secret circle"...

00:01.915 --> 00:04.799
My sweet Cassie,
you finding this means I'm gone,

00:04.800 --> 00:06.467
and for that,
I am so sorry.

00:06.469 --> 00:08.368
I didn't want you
to have this life,

00:08.370 --> 00:10.068
but destiny's
not easy to run from.

00:10.070 --> 00:13.505
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded 100% witch.

00:13.507 --> 00:14.758
A complete circle is 6.

00:14.759 --> 00:16.077
You complete
the circle.

00:16.079 --> 00:19.164
You have evil blood,
dark magic.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.442
You can't control it.

00:20.444 --> 00:21.763
We can all
figure this out together.

00:21.765 --> 00:23.274
Don't!

00:25.156 --> 00:27.400
I want to be
a real witch instead of

00:27.402 --> 00:28.743
this "spell
by committee" thing.

00:28.745 --> 00:29.883
"Lee Lebeque."

00:29.885 --> 00:31.390
Can I help you?

00:31.392 --> 00:33.134
We need help with a spell.
I know what you are.

00:33.136 --> 00:34.777
You're a witch.

00:34.779 --> 00:36.956
Grandma Kate, this is
my friend Cassie Blake.

00:36.958 --> 00:38.061
Amelia's daughter.

00:38.063 --> 00:40.003
You are also
your father's child.

00:40.005 --> 00:40.972
You know about him.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.342
The darkness
took him over.

00:42.344 --> 00:43.645
Can I stop it?

00:43.647 --> 00:45.385
There's a spell.
What is this?

00:45.387 --> 00:46.388
Elderberry.

00:46.390 --> 00:47.696
A death tree?

00:49.602 --> 00:50.908
You have to die.
No.

00:53.017 --> 00:54.152
Get me out of here!

00:54.154 --> 00:55.455
What have you done,
mother?

00:55.457 --> 00:56.794
She's John Blackwell's
daughter.

00:56.796 --> 00:59.736
I had to find out how
powerful her magic was.

00:59.738 --> 01:01.874
Let me out!

01:05.346 --> 01:09.357
You're in the same position as
you were when I woke up.

01:09.359 --> 01:13.269
Well, I--I know there is something
in here about my father.

01:13.271 --> 01:14.774
After what happened
with your grandmother,

01:14.776 --> 01:17.847
I just--I want to learn as much
about him as I can.

01:17.849 --> 01:20.153
I'm not sure looking into
all that is the best idea.

01:20.155 --> 01:22.720
Maybe you should
stay as far away

01:22.745 --> 01:24.174
from dark magic as you can.

01:24.297 --> 01:26.131
Jake said understanding
where it comes from

01:26.133 --> 01:27.935
is what can help me
control it.

01:27.937 --> 01:31.408
I don't think you should take
Jake's advice on anything.

01:32.244 --> 01:34.314
He's still
a part of the circle.

01:34.316 --> 01:35.482
We need him.

01:37.888 --> 01:40.258
What if he never
comes back?

01:41.427 --> 01:43.263
We won't be as strong,

01:43.265 --> 01:45.933
but we'll still
be better off.

01:50.175 --> 01:52.645
Jake was a witch hunter.

01:52.647 --> 01:55.684
And even if he started
to question that,

01:55.686 --> 01:58.922
in the end, he chose
to leave with them.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.498
Maybe a little distraction
could be a good thing.

02:05.601 --> 02:07.571
I'm helping out with the
fire and ice winter dance.

02:07.573 --> 02:09.174
You're coming, right?

02:09.175 --> 02:10.476
Uh, yeah.

02:10.478 --> 02:11.512
I guess so.

02:11.514 --> 02:13.115
Here's my issue.

02:13.117 --> 02:15.017
I love this dress,

02:15.019 --> 02:17.255
but we can only
wear red or white.

02:17.257 --> 02:19.524
Ok.

02:19.526 --> 02:22.488
Want to try
changing the color?

02:22.490 --> 02:24.121
Together?

02:24.123 --> 02:26.157
Uh-huh.

02:26.159 --> 02:27.659
Ok. You get that end.

02:27.661 --> 02:29.196
All right.

02:29.198 --> 02:31.699
Uh, let's go white.

02:32.902 --> 02:33.903
No? Red?

02:33.905 --> 02:35.104
Mmm, yes.
Good choice.

02:35.106 --> 02:38.376
Now this is a good use of our
ancient gifts.

02:38.378 --> 02:39.811
I know, right? Ok.

02:39.813 --> 02:44.151
Stitch, thread, and seam,
change from blue to red.

02:44.153 --> 02:48.490
Stitch, thread, and seam,
change from blue to red.

02:48.492 --> 02:52.696
Stitch, thread, and seam,
change from blue to red.

02:55.101 --> 02:57.803
Change from blue to red.

- Adam, wait.

03:24.510 --> 03:26.043
I gotta get to school.

03:26.045 --> 03:28.981
I, uh, volunteered to chaperone
at the dance tonight,

03:28.983 --> 03:30.316
help out.

03:30.318 --> 03:31.751
Ah.

03:32.954 --> 03:34.989
Now, you know they
don't serve alcohol

03:34.991 --> 03:36.858
at these high school
dances, right?

03:38.161 --> 03:40.530
I haven't had a drink
in a little while,

03:40.532 --> 03:43.033
couple weeks.

03:44.936 --> 03:47.304
Well, I hope
you stay with it.

03:47.306 --> 03:48.472
That's the plan.

03:49.341 --> 03:51.509
Adam.

03:54.014 --> 03:56.950
I can't change
the things I said to Diana

03:56.952 --> 03:59.352
about you and Cassie,

03:59.354 --> 04:02.089
but I promise

04:02.091 --> 04:04.592
I never meant to hurt you.

04:05.461 --> 04:07.328
I know.

04:10.164 --> 04:13.399
Diana, she's--
she thinks I need

04:13.401 --> 04:16.601
to figure out
my feelings for Cassie.

04:21.572 --> 04:23.538
Do you...

04:23.540 --> 04:26.341
Have feelings for Cassie?

04:31.279 --> 04:33.279
Yes.

04:34.414 --> 04:38.616
I felt a connection between us
the first moment we met.

04:41.686 --> 04:43.787
Maybe that's just
because you planted

04:43.789 --> 04:46.189
this ridiculous destiny idea
into my head.

04:46.191 --> 04:48.791
Heh. Maybe.

04:48.793 --> 04:51.326
But I think you'd know
the difference.

04:58.733 --> 05:01.067
Cassie,
I wouldn't worry about it.

05:01.069 --> 05:03.369
Sometimes spells
just go wrong.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.572
And now I have a good excuse to
buy a new dress.

05:05.574 --> 05:08.974
Yeah, but we were
doing circle magic,

05:08.976 --> 05:11.309
and then my dark magic
took over.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.644
What if I'm never able
to do a spell again

05:14.646 --> 05:16.613
without something bad
happening?

05:16.615 --> 05:17.647
You don't know that.

05:17.649 --> 05:19.248
It could have
been a fluke.

05:19.250 --> 05:21.783
Wish I believed that.

05:28.757 --> 05:29.824
Hey.

05:29.826 --> 05:31.226
Hey, guys.

05:31.228 --> 05:32.260
How's it going?

05:32.262 --> 05:34.229
Actually I was thinking

05:34.231 --> 05:37.598
I need some nice, normal school
activities to throw myself into.

05:37.600 --> 05:38.699
Hmm.

05:38.701 --> 05:41.134
Any chance you need help
with the dance tonight?

05:41.136 --> 05:42.302
Yeah. That'd be great.

05:42.304 --> 05:44.371
How's Holden?

05:44.373 --> 05:46.039
He went back to school.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.940
I'm really gonna miss him.

05:47.942 --> 05:48.908
You're kidding.

05:48.910 --> 05:51.076
I was gonna ask him
to the dance.

05:52.912 --> 05:54.679
I guess I'm going solo.

05:54.681 --> 05:56.682
- I'm going alone, too.
- Me, three.

05:56.684 --> 05:57.916
We should all
go together,

05:57.918 --> 05:59.551
make a girls night
out of it.

05:59.553 --> 06:02.720
Or a girls night out and Faye,
if she wants to come.

06:02.722 --> 06:06.355
I can't quite
picture that, but I'm in.

06:07.957 --> 06:09.691
What is it?

06:09.693 --> 06:10.959
Probably nothing.
I'll, um--

06:10.961 --> 06:12.727

got the hang of it?

06:38.723 --> 06:40.656

the dance starts at 3:00.

06:44.361 --> 06:45.693

Well, he lived in town
for a while, right?

07:13.117 --> 07:14.683
He died here.

So I guess you
and Melissa aren't the only

08:05.126 --> 08:06.792
Eclectic circle
you got going.

08:06.794 --> 08:10.062
I think the voodoo
has gone to your head.

08:10.064 --> 08:11.563
And I think
you lost your magic

08:11.565 --> 08:12.830
after you bound
your circle.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.433
See? I told you.

08:16.435 --> 08:19.369
I can help you.

08:21.572 --> 08:23.006
You should go.

08:23.008 --> 08:24.841
Last time
I was in your garage,

08:24.843 --> 08:26.409
I broke
some of your toys.

08:26.411 --> 08:29.678
Hate to see something
happen to your car.

08:36.085 --> 08:38.419
A birth certificate?
Really?

08:38.421 --> 08:39.587
Plus photo I.D.
I can get you

08:39.589 --> 08:40.655
any public records
from the back,

08:40.657 --> 08:43.056
but all personal information
was digitized,

08:43.058 --> 08:44.858
and without proof
that you're related

08:44.860 --> 08:46.359
to the person
you're researching,

08:46.361 --> 08:48.027
I can't
give you access.

08:48.029 --> 08:49.094
Well, that's fair enough.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.729
Uh, but, hey,
while we're here,

08:50.731 --> 08:52.797
maybe you could help me
with something else.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.333
My dad owns
the boathouse restaurant

08:55.335 --> 08:56.634
down at sunset marina.
Sure.

08:56.636 --> 08:57.702
I know the place.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.870
Well, our neighbors
are being sticklers

08:59.872 --> 09:01.838
about us
taking down a tree,

09:01.840 --> 09:04.107
and so my dad wanted me
to check the property lines.

09:04.109 --> 09:06.142
That, I can
help you with.

09:06.144 --> 09:07.610
Give me a minute.

09:07.612 --> 09:09.578
Take your time.

09:15.217 --> 09:16.517
What are you doing?

09:16.519 --> 09:19.252
Get on the computer.
I'll keep an eye out.

09:31.161 --> 09:33.028
There's nothing--

09:33.030 --> 09:35.697
no date of birth,
nothing about the boatyard fire,

09:35.699 --> 09:37.732
no police report,
no coroner's report,

09:37.734 --> 09:39.434
not even a date of death.

09:39.436 --> 09:41.103
Search for
tax information,

09:41.105 --> 09:42.204
medical records,
an obituary.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.740
If he died here,
there has to be something.

09:44.742 --> 09:46.575
Wait.

09:46.577 --> 09:48.576
There's a deed
under his name--

09:48.578 --> 09:50.745
residence, 7 Briar Hill.

09:50.747 --> 09:53.448
7 Briar Hill?

09:57.319 --> 09:58.753
My God.

09:58.755 --> 09:59.721
What?

09:59.723 --> 10:01.489
I have to show you
something. Come on.

10:06.827 --> 10:09.293
What are we
doing here?

10:21.511 --> 10:23.278
I can't believe
your dad lived here.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.745
How did you guys
end up here?

10:24.747 --> 10:26.813
There was a map
in Diana's Book of Shadows

10:26.815 --> 10:28.482
that showed the confluence
of energy points

10:28.484 --> 10:29.449
in Chance Harbor.

10:29.451 --> 10:30.917
It brought us
to these woods.

10:30.919 --> 10:33.287
It's supposed to be where
magic is at its strongest.

10:33.289 --> 10:38.091
There's gotta be
something of his left behind.

10:38.093 --> 10:39.192
Wait.

10:39.194 --> 10:42.228
I remember throwing some stuff
in the basement.

10:42.230 --> 10:43.696
Show me.

10:52.670 --> 10:55.172
It's all just junk.

10:55.174 --> 10:57.273
Maybe we should just go.

10:58.642 --> 11:00.742
You know what I mean?
Come back tomorrow

11:00.744 --> 11:02.444
and check it all out
with fresh eyes.

11:02.446 --> 11:04.978
You go. I wanna
look around a little more.

11:08.947 --> 11:13.317
How 'bout I pick you up
later at your house?

11:13.319 --> 11:17.389
Maybe we could go to the fire
and ice thing together.

11:18.625 --> 11:22.593
I--I think we should
take separate cars.

11:22.595 --> 11:25.029
Cassie--

11:25.031 --> 11:27.531
Well, I don't want it to seem
like we're together together.

11:29.568 --> 11:30.935
That could hurt Diana.

11:30.937 --> 11:34.138
Diana has made it clear
that she's moving on...

11:35.541 --> 11:37.041
Like I should be doing.

11:38.076 --> 11:42.579
I am sure it is not
that simple for her.

11:43.681 --> 11:47.482
She has been there for me
since the day that I got here.

11:47.484 --> 11:50.351
I am lucky just to know
someone like her,

11:50.353 --> 11:52.786
let alone have her
as a friend. I...

11:54.255 --> 11:56.923
I can't do anything
to jeopardize that friendship.

11:56.925 --> 12:03.228
And what if you and I
really are meant to be together?

12:05.731 --> 12:07.732
I can't think
about that.

12:09.101 --> 12:11.035
It's funny,
'cause these days,

12:11.037 --> 12:14.237
I can't think
about anything else.

12:26.548 --> 12:28.983
How mini Martha Stewart
of you.

12:31.787 --> 12:33.620
I think
it's kind of fun.

12:33.622 --> 12:36.388
Are you really going
to the dance with Diana?

12:36.390 --> 12:38.990
And Cassie.
You should come.

12:38.992 --> 12:42.260
Oh, I wouldn't want
to ruin your power trio.

12:42.262 --> 12:46.330
Besides, I'm busy trying
to get my solo magic back.

12:46.332 --> 12:48.498
Lee claims he can help.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.600
Creepy fake voodoo guy?

12:50.602 --> 12:52.101
He's a scam artist.

12:52.103 --> 12:54.136
Or maybe he's not.

12:54.138 --> 12:58.506
His grandpa was
some big, bad voodoo king.

12:58.508 --> 13:00.775
And he is cute.

13:00.777 --> 13:03.844
In a serial killer living in his
mom's basement kind of way.

13:03.846 --> 13:06.046
And I should care
about your opinion

13:06.048 --> 13:08.715
because your taste
in men is so good?

13:45.213 --> 13:47.848
Up or down?

13:47.850 --> 13:49.783
Tough call.

13:49.785 --> 13:52.252
Down brings out
your eyes.

13:52.254 --> 13:55.655
Up shows off that neck and
your cleavage.

13:55.657 --> 13:57.222
Up it is, then.

13:59.059 --> 14:01.827
Remember when we used
to do this all the time,

14:01.829 --> 14:03.295
play dress-up
in your room?

14:03.297 --> 14:05.330
Steal my mom's clothes
from the attic.

14:05.332 --> 14:07.631
Your dad got so mad
the first time

14:07.633 --> 14:09.833
he caught us
putting on makeup.

14:10.836 --> 14:13.337
What happened?

14:13.339 --> 14:15.072
To us being friends?

14:16.407 --> 14:17.873
Faye, I guess.

14:19.709 --> 14:22.510
But we still did things together
for a while.

14:23.378 --> 14:26.013
Then came Adam.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.080
Right.

14:29.749 --> 14:32.117
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

14:32.119 --> 14:34.386
Where have you been?
The dance starts in, like, an hour.

14:34.388 --> 14:35.553
The abandoned house.

14:37.723 --> 14:39.323
That symbol
was carved into

14:39.325 --> 14:40.825
the ceiling
of the basement,

14:40.827 --> 14:42.760
I think
by my father.

14:42.762 --> 14:43.994
Why would you think that?

14:43.996 --> 14:45.729
Because
he lived there.

14:45.731 --> 14:47.163
What?

14:47.165 --> 14:49.064
Your father lived
at our abandoned house?

14:49.066 --> 14:50.766
Apparently,
but the weirdest part

14:50.768 --> 14:53.634
is I'm positive I've
seen the symbol before.

14:55.170 --> 14:56.437
Here.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.808
That's weird.

15:00.810 --> 15:04.375
The symbol your dad drew
is in your mom's family book. Why?

15:04.377 --> 15:05.408
What does it mean?

15:05.410 --> 15:07.576
No idea.

15:08.411 --> 15:10.779
Oh, there's
a page missing.

15:10.781 --> 15:12.680
These lines continue
onto the missing page.

15:12.682 --> 15:14.482
I bet there's more
about the symbol on it.

15:14.484 --> 15:16.383
But I've combed through this book
a thousand times.

15:16.385 --> 15:17.851
I would have noticed
a missing page.

15:17.853 --> 15:19.286
Must have been
ripped out recently.

15:19.288 --> 15:20.253
How?

15:20.255 --> 15:22.589
Who else has had the book
besides you?

15:26.393 --> 15:27.526
Faye.

15:27.528 --> 15:28.828
You're kidding.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.766
Why are you
looking at me?

15:34.768 --> 15:36.334
You think
I'm Faye's keeper?

15:36.336 --> 15:40.004
It had to be here.
There's no one else.

15:44.942 --> 15:47.209
You cleaned up
the place.

15:47.211 --> 15:48.377
Yeah.

15:48.379 --> 15:50.546
Next time you want
to trash my garage,

15:50.548 --> 15:51.580
give me a heads-up

15:51.582 --> 15:53.916
so I can hide
the expensive stuff.

15:53.918 --> 15:56.585
You know none of this
is expensive.

15:58.688 --> 15:59.855
What?

16:00.690 --> 16:03.125
We both know
why you're here.

16:03.127 --> 16:05.794
Ok, fine.

16:05.796 --> 16:07.763
Say I'm in a circle.

16:07.765 --> 16:10.966
What's that got to do with me
getting my own magic?

16:10.968 --> 16:12.134
Everything.

16:13.236 --> 16:15.638
I took a closer look
at the spell you gave me.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.573
This is
old-school voudon

16:17.575 --> 16:19.975
designed to extract
dark magic.

16:19.977 --> 16:21.777
Extract?

16:21.779 --> 16:23.378
Like an exorcism.

16:23.380 --> 16:25.746
Only, instead of
casting out demons,

16:25.748 --> 16:28.615
it pulls the dark magic
out of people.

16:30.017 --> 16:32.218
Or in your case, witches.

16:32.220 --> 16:35.755
I can take that magic
and put it into you.

16:37.090 --> 16:38.289
Listening.

16:38.291 --> 16:41.559
Well, if this book
is from someone in your circle,

16:41.561 --> 16:43.494
then the odds are
that their bloodline

16:43.496 --> 16:45.329
has the dark magic
we need.

16:47.099 --> 16:48.099
Whose is it?

16:48.101 --> 16:49.600
Emo kid's?

16:50.969 --> 16:52.936
The little blonde one,
Cassie.

16:52.938 --> 16:54.203
Really?

16:54.205 --> 16:56.605
I guess you can't judge a book
by its lip gloss.

16:56.607 --> 16:58.474
She doesn't even
want her power.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.008
So let's take it.

17:01.177 --> 17:03.044
But you should know...

17:03.046 --> 17:06.079
Dark magic
can turn on you.

17:07.948 --> 17:09.815
Are you ready
to take that risk?

17:15.286 --> 17:18.820
So if this spell takes away
Cassie's dark magic,

17:18.821 --> 17:22.556
what do I have to do to get it?
Stick pins in a little Cassie doll?

17:22.688 --> 17:24.287
Better.
After her magic's out,

17:24.289 --> 17:25.855
we tether it to you.

17:25.857 --> 17:26.821
Tether.

17:26.824 --> 17:28.557
Not some mind-meld thing,
is it?

17:28.559 --> 17:31.426
Because I do not want to be stuck
in that girl's head.

17:31.428 --> 17:33.294
Tethering links
your energies.

17:33.296 --> 17:35.263
Can you really do this?

17:35.265 --> 17:36.530
That depends on you.

17:36.532 --> 17:38.765
I don't have the power that
my grandparents did,

17:38.767 --> 17:42.101
but with your magic,
can make it happen.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.368
Does it hurt?

17:43.370 --> 17:45.403
It shouldn't.

17:45.405 --> 17:46.937
What about Cassie?

17:46.939 --> 17:48.572
She won't feel a thing.

17:48.574 --> 17:50.976
She doesn't even
have to be in the room.

17:50.978 --> 17:51.977
Somewhere nearby.

17:51.979 --> 17:53.346
And that's it?

17:55.482 --> 17:56.582
We need something first,

17:56.584 --> 17:58.417
something Cassie has
an emotional connection to.

17:58.419 --> 17:59.451
Can you get that?

17:59.453 --> 18:02.253
Of course.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.054
But what do you
get out of it?

18:04.056 --> 18:05.756
I told you.
I'm just the guide.

18:05.758 --> 18:08.592
Right, and I'm just
Glinda the good witch.

18:08.594 --> 18:11.394
You're not a "something
for nothing" kind of guy.

18:11.396 --> 18:14.463
Let's just say I'll ask you for
a favor someday.

18:14.465 --> 18:16.799
You're not getting laid.

18:17.934 --> 18:22.070
When we have sex, it's not
gonna be because of a deal.

18:25.674 --> 18:27.274
So are you in?

18:29.111 --> 18:30.477
Speak of the devil.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.612
Cassie?

18:32.614 --> 18:35.481
You ripped a page out
of my book, didn't you?

18:35.483 --> 18:37.416
- What book?
- Don't play dumb, Faye.

18:37.418 --> 18:39.251
You're the only one
I ever lent it to.

18:39.253 --> 18:41.386
One little page.

18:41.388 --> 18:44.088
From my mother's book.
You had no right to steal it.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.556
Right.
You're the victim.

18:46.558 --> 18:47.958
Poor Cassie.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.193
"I steal
boyfriends."

18:49.195 --> 18:50.494
Poor Cassie.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.229
"I almost
killed Adam."

18:52.231 --> 18:54.030
Poor Cassie.

18:54.032 --> 18:57.467
I am so sick of you
and your jealousy.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.734
Stop being pathetic,
Faye.

18:58.736 --> 19:00.269
Just give back the page.

19:00.271 --> 19:02.738
Fine.

19:02.740 --> 19:05.106
Are you going
to the dance tonight?

19:05.108 --> 19:06.107
Yes.

19:06.109 --> 19:07.775
Well, I wasn't going to,

19:07.777 --> 19:09.963
but seeing as you
obviously can't live without

19:09.988 --> 19:11.328
your precious page,

19:11.981 --> 19:13.747

Actually, yeah.

20:24.207 --> 20:26.641
I haven't been to one of
these things in a while.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.144
Do you mind if I ask you
about my father?

20:30.146 --> 20:33.213
Just no one else seems
willing to talk about him.

20:33.215 --> 20:35.682
I may have given you
the wrong idea.

20:35.684 --> 20:37.517
I know
you didn't like him.

20:38.452 --> 20:40.653
That fire
that he died in...

20:41.855 --> 20:44.056
That so many people
died in...

20:45.858 --> 20:48.727
Did he have anything
to do with that?

20:50.362 --> 20:51.662
Cassie...

20:52.965 --> 20:55.666
This is not a road
you want to go down.

20:57.034 --> 20:59.000
It doesn't matter
who he was.

20:59.002 --> 21:01.935
You didn't answer
my question.

21:01.937 --> 21:04.505
I need to know.

21:04.507 --> 21:06.740
What if I'm
just like him?

21:08.342 --> 21:09.776
No.

21:09.778 --> 21:11.611
He didn't
start the fire.

21:11.613 --> 21:14.246
And you're not defined
by your parents.

21:14.248 --> 21:16.348
It's your own actions
that matter.

21:16.350 --> 21:20.084
I am gonna find out who he was
one way or another.

21:20.086 --> 21:22.853
It's not what
your mother would want.

21:26.024 --> 21:28.024
Probably not,

21:28.026 --> 21:30.393
but she doesn't
have a say anymore.

A little.

21:52.813 --> 21:53.946
Ecch.

21:53.948 --> 21:55.781
Mm, I get it.

21:55.783 --> 21:57.882
No matter what advice
anyone gives,

21:57.884 --> 22:00.518
the idea
of just moving on...

22:01.853 --> 22:03.353
Is impossible.

22:03.355 --> 22:05.088
No.

22:05.090 --> 22:06.589
Not impossible.

22:06.591 --> 22:08.024
We can't think that way.

22:08.026 --> 22:09.592
We're witches, damn it.

22:09.594 --> 22:11.960
We can get
whoever we want, right?

22:11.962 --> 22:13.028
You mean with magic?

22:13.030 --> 22:15.296
No, because we're tough...

22:15.298 --> 22:16.998
And we're witchy...

22:17.000 --> 22:18.432
And we're dressed
kind of slutty.

22:18.434 --> 22:19.467
You know what?

22:19.469 --> 22:20.434
You're right.

22:20.436 --> 22:22.068
We're all
of those things.

22:22.070 --> 22:23.603
I think you need to
take the initiative

22:23.605 --> 22:25.104
if you want to dance
with a guy.

22:25.106 --> 22:27.940
Everyone thinks you and Adam
are still together.

in the house's basement

27:30.790 --> 27:35.292
She wouldn't even accept a ride
from me tonight

27:35.294 --> 27:38.794
because she was afraid that
you'd get the wrong idea.

27:38.796 --> 27:41.095
That's stupid,
right?

27:41.097 --> 27:43.931
There's no reason I shouldn't
be able to give her a ride.

27:43.933 --> 27:46.233
Of course not.

27:46.235 --> 27:49.034
Eh, then maybe
I should talk to her.

27:49.036 --> 27:50.001
Yeah.

27:50.003 --> 27:52.403

that would...

whatever.

I was on the floor,

35:33.250 --> 35:34.983
and then somebody
walked in.

35:34.985 --> 35:36.718
I saw their boots.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.553
M-maybe a fireman.

35:38.555 --> 35:40.055
I don't think so.

to be alive, Faye.

35:56.171 --> 35:58.504

that stupid spell?

35:58.506 --> 36:00.272
Don't play innocent,
Melissa.

36:00.274 --> 36:02.174
You were there
when I took it out of her book.

36:02.176 --> 36:04.175
I know I should
have said something,

36:04.177 --> 36:06.611
but I didn't want
to betray Faye.

36:06.613 --> 36:07.545

36:07.547 --> 36:09.246

burned down the school.

36:09.248 --> 36:10.881

my power.

36:10.883 --> 36:13.517

you don't want your dark magic.

36:13.519 --> 36:15.185
I was doing you a favor.

36:15.187 --> 36:16.986

destroyed the circle.

what was happening,

36:18.957 --> 36:20.222

the first time

to clean it up.

a demon

36:28.231 --> 36:29.697
that ends up
killing Nick.

36:29.699 --> 36:31.832
Then she brings Jake
into the circle,

36:31.834 --> 36:34.234
and it turns out
he's a witch hunter,

36:34.236 --> 36:37.537
and then she almost chokes
Adam to death with her mind,

36:37.539 --> 36:38.905
yet I'm the evil one.

36:38.907 --> 36:40.374
Those things
were accidents.

36:40.376 --> 36:43.343
Like I tried to hurt
anyone on purpose.

36:43.345 --> 36:47.580
I just wanted a little indie magic
to play with.

36:49.416 --> 36:53.784
Miss innocent here is
full of dark magic,

36:53.786 --> 36:55.452
evil magic.

36:56.754 --> 36:58.354
How does this bitch
get a free pass,

36:58.356 --> 36:59.955
and I get burned
at the stake?

37:04.459 --> 37:06.426
Forget it.
Screw you guys.

37:10.498 --> 37:12.532
Adam!

37:13.401 --> 37:15.535
I lost track of you.

37:16.503 --> 37:18.270
Thank God you're Ok.

37:18.272 --> 37:20.872
I'm fine, Dad.
I'm fine.

37:20.874 --> 37:23.974
Fire marshal says
he's never seen anything like it.

37:23.976 --> 37:25.876
Yeah. It's weird.

37:35.552 --> 37:37.253
Thanks for the ride.

37:38.488 --> 37:40.889
You Ok?

37:42.624 --> 37:44.625
I don't know.

37:44.627 --> 37:46.559
I know this is
gonna sound dumb,

37:46.561 --> 37:48.828
but I feel bad for Faye.

37:48.830 --> 37:50.529
We were kind of harsh.

37:50.531 --> 37:51.930
Melissa...

37:51.932 --> 37:54.166
You could have died tonight
because of her.

37:54.168 --> 37:55.166
I know.

37:55.168 --> 37:56.634
But...

37:58.370 --> 38:01.038
Look, she's a little
wrapped up in herself.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.272
Everyone knows that.
It's just...

38:03.274 --> 38:05.107
She's your friend.

38:05.109 --> 38:07.409
She is.

38:07.411 --> 38:10.612
She just has her own way
of showing it.

38:12.514 --> 38:15.616
Must sound
pretty pathetic to you.

38:15.618 --> 38:17.017
Not at all.

38:19.087 --> 38:21.821
It's hard thinking
someone you've been close to

38:21.823 --> 38:24.423
is drifting away.

38:24.425 --> 38:27.959
I'm worried Faye is
doing more than drifting.

38:27.961 --> 38:31.562
Lately the only thing
she thinks about is power.

38:32.964 --> 38:35.032
She's starting
to scare me.

38:36.768 --> 38:40.003
To be honest, Cassie's starting
to scare me, too.

38:41.305 --> 38:43.906
She can't seem to control
her dark magic,

38:43.908 --> 38:45.674
and it's getting
more powerful.

38:51.380 --> 38:53.748
What happened to your
little circle pals?

38:53.750 --> 38:55.883
I'm done with them.

38:55.885 --> 38:58.118
But...

38:58.120 --> 39:00.086
Not with me.

39:03.290 --> 39:04.790
Not yet.

39:07.460 --> 39:09.995
Are you here
to pay me back?

39:09.997 --> 39:11.662
For the spell?

39:11.664 --> 39:14.131
It didn't work.

39:14.133 --> 39:17.000
I got you magic,
didn't I?

39:17.002 --> 39:19.802
The circle's magic,
not Cassie's.

39:19.804 --> 39:21.303
That's not my problem.

39:22.404 --> 39:23.504
I still got you power.

39:23.506 --> 39:25.473
You were the one
who gave it back.

39:26.308 --> 39:29.142
You think you got me,
too, don't you?

39:30.011 --> 39:32.479
Not yet.

39:38.085 --> 39:40.285
I barely knew
this basement existed,

39:40.287 --> 39:42.888
and suddenly it's
the busiest room in the place.

39:44.557 --> 39:45.890
What are you doing?

39:45.892 --> 39:47.058
Nothing.

39:52.296 --> 39:55.597
You said this symbol is
used to channel dark magic.

39:55.599 --> 40:00.135
It's part of the spell that Faye
used to try and take away mine.

40:00.137 --> 40:05.405
What if my dad was trying to take
away his own dark magic?

40:05.407 --> 40:07.541
You are not him.

40:08.843 --> 40:11.343
You don't need
to do this.

40:12.178 --> 40:15.713
I burnt Diana's dress
this morning,

40:15.715 --> 40:17.948
almost killed you
last week.

40:17.950 --> 40:20.317
Whatever this is,
I don't want it inside me.

40:20.319 --> 40:21.985
It is too dangerous.

40:21.987 --> 40:24.321
Didn't we learn
that lesson from Faye's

40:24.323 --> 40:26.456
mind-bogglingly stupid
behavior tonight?

40:26.458 --> 40:28.024
Maybe she didn't
do it right.

40:29.726 --> 40:31.693
It's not worth the risk.

40:31.695 --> 40:33.895
There has to be
another way.

40:35.197 --> 40:36.497
Come on.
Give me the spell.

40:39.067 --> 40:40.867
I mean it.

40:41.735 --> 40:43.402
Give me the spell.

40:53.646 --> 40:56.314
Your destiny
is important to me.
