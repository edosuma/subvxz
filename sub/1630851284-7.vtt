13:00.855 --> 13:03.006
<i> COSTAS (over phone):</i>
<i> Hello, church chum.</i>

13:03.024 --> 13:05.842
I, um...
I don't have your money.

13:05.935 --> 13:07.619
And I don't have your man.

13:07.770 --> 13:09.436
Funny how things work out.

13:09.531 --> 13:12.031
I committed every sin
in the book to get that money--

13:12.183 --> 13:14.942
except sloth, I guess--
and now it's gone.

13:15.036 --> 13:17.353
Money can be lost, Mr. Flanders,

13:17.372 --> 13:19.947
but a debt never goes away.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.949
I am coming to collect.

13:21.968 --> 13:25.194
When you least expect it,
expect it.

13:25.288 --> 13:27.547
-You mean now?
-No, not now.

13:27.699 --> 13:30.700
Well, you saying not now
makes me expect it more.

13:30.793 --> 13:33.553
Look, this is the one time
you shouldn't expect it,

13:33.705 --> 13:36.481
but every other time,
do expect it.

13:43.381 --> 13:45.715
<i> NARRATOR:</i>
<i> Three years ago,</i>
<i> Homer Simpson risked his life</i>

13:45.733 --> 13:46.974
<i> to save an orphanage's future.</i>

13:46.993 --> 13:49.661
And now, I'm here
to save your car's future.

13:49.888 --> 13:51.237
Oil changes, alignment,

13:51.331 --> 13:53.814
and brake pads,
brake pads, brake pads.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.392
All at Heroic Lube and Tire.

13:56.452 --> 13:58.986
<i> Where Route 4 meets</i>
<i> Disco Stu Memorial Drive.</i>

13:59.080 --> 14:01.840
<i>Just look for the inflatable me.</i>

14:02.734 --> 14:04.734
Mr. Simpson, may I just say

14:04.827 --> 14:08.012
it is an honor to get
my washer fluid from you.

14:08.164 --> 14:11.432
Yo, can I get a selfie
with that gnarly arm?

14:13.019 --> 14:14.185
What's it like to be married

14:14.337 --> 14:16.579
to the most beloved man
in Springfield?

14:16.598 --> 14:19.248
Every day's
better than the last.

14:19.267 --> 14:20.507
Now come back soon

14:20.527 --> 14:23.753
'cause you'll always get
a hero's welcome.

14:23.771 --> 14:25.012
(laughter)

14:25.106 --> 14:26.347
OTTO:
I get it.

14:26.366 --> 14:30.285
"Hero." The word makes me
sick to my stomach.

14:34.449 --> 14:36.857
I'll never forget
seeing you choose the money

14:36.877 --> 14:39.268
instead of saving Ned. Never.

14:39.362 --> 14:42.881
I wish I could explain,
but I can't.

14:43.032 --> 14:45.458
I would've left this
godforsaken marriage

14:45.552 --> 14:47.868
years ago if it
wasn't for the kids--

14:47.962 --> 14:50.054
-My special little guy!
-There he is.

14:50.206 --> 14:51.114
Check it out.

14:51.132 --> 14:53.282
I got my
Online Citizenship badge

14:53.301 --> 14:55.542
for being so polite
on social media.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.730
You're going to be the youngest
Eagle Scout in town.

14:58.881 --> 15:00.398
Well, I am half hero.

15:01.976 --> 15:05.795
I got 100 RSVPs
to my birthday party.

15:05.888 --> 15:07.071
(laughs)

15:07.298 --> 15:10.408
They probably just want
to come to meet you.

15:11.302 --> 15:12.468
Got some mail, Dad.

15:12.561 --> 15:15.496
Why'd you get a blank postcard
from Wyoming?

15:16.808 --> 15:18.641
Hm, that's weird.

15:18.660 --> 15:20.543
Probably just junk.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.788
Don't shoot, you little weirdos.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.033
Daddy, it's Mr. Simpson.

16:17.126 --> 16:20.019
Hiddly-ho, neighborino.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.390
So, how are things
in good old Springfield?

16:24.542 --> 16:26.317
Uh... it's okay.

16:26.469 --> 16:28.544
Jailbird got super religious.

16:28.563 --> 16:31.547
(crying):
And Marge hates me.

16:31.566 --> 16:35.142
Our marriage is deader
than Disco Stu.

16:35.236 --> 16:38.145
All because I tried
to save that money's life

16:38.164 --> 16:39.813
and not yours.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.333
That money made sinners
of us all.

16:42.485 --> 16:44.168
Can I tell you something, Homer?

16:44.320 --> 16:46.671
I wanted people
to know I donated it.

16:46.898 --> 16:49.156
I wanted the attention.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.009
I brought all of this upon us.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.902
We both suck.

16:52.920 --> 16:54.846
(crying)

16:54.997 --> 16:57.598
Equally.

16:58.910 --> 17:00.243
(glass shatters)

17:00.261 --> 17:02.836
Oh, no. He's tracked you here.

17:02.930 --> 17:05.005
No way. I took
all the precautions,

17:05.099 --> 17:06.840
even the mariachi Ferris wheel.

17:06.934 --> 17:09.176
(banging on door)

17:09.195 --> 17:11.345
-(screams)
-What is it, Homer?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.514
A mistress?
A secret family?

17:13.608 --> 17:16.275
You'd better not be
a sports podcaster.

17:16.427 --> 17:18.519
(gasps) Ned?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.854
Don't be too sore
at this fella, Marge.

17:20.948 --> 17:22.448
Homer's been
our lifeline up here:

17:22.600 --> 17:25.376
food, shelter,
books he thinks I'd like.

17:25.603 --> 17:27.528
They certainly were
a motley crew.

17:27.547 --> 17:31.290
This is the most selfless thing
you've ever done,

17:31.442 --> 17:33.125
and you didn't even tell anyone.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.720
I couldn't say anything,
or Ned would be in danger.

17:35.947 --> 17:38.798
There's this crazy psycho
who wants to kill him, and--

17:38.950 --> 17:40.299
Hey, you weren't
followed here, were you?

17:40.451 --> 17:41.300
(gunshots)

17:41.452 --> 17:43.061
(all scream)

17:55.075 --> 17:57.633
Great, more walking.

17:57.652 --> 18:00.152
Homie, if we don't make it,

18:00.305 --> 18:03.730
I need you to know
that you are a decent man,

18:03.750 --> 18:05.975
and I love you.

18:05.993 --> 18:08.735
No. I won't put you two
in any more danger.

18:08.830 --> 18:10.546
I'm the one he wants.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.241
-Okay. Bye.
-Phew. Good luck.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.094
(dramatic music playing)

18:36.507 --> 18:39.008
It's been a long time,
Mr. Flanders.

18:39.068 --> 18:41.101
Now, will you
be paying your debt

18:41.195 --> 18:43.696
in money or blood?

18:43.848 --> 18:45.030
(panting)

18:45.183 --> 18:47.250
Blood it is.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.612
Ah, balance.

18:52.540 --> 18:55.115
Balance? Is that what
this blood-soaked rigmarole

18:55.209 --> 18:57.468
has been all about? Why?

18:57.620 --> 19:01.622
You ever hear the parable
of Lucifer and the millipede?

19:01.716 --> 19:03.516
One day, a tiny...

19:06.295 --> 19:07.478
The end.

19:07.630 --> 19:08.871
Oh, just kill me already.

19:08.964 --> 19:10.815
I deserve it for stealing,

19:10.966 --> 19:13.209
seducing, fibbing.

19:13.227 --> 19:15.987
I tarnished the good name
of my Paw Paw,

19:16.214 --> 19:18.322
Sherriff Ned Flanders.

19:18.474 --> 19:20.307
(laughs)

19:20.401 --> 19:23.494
Your grandfather was dirtier
than a hobo's handkerchief.

19:23.721 --> 19:27.890
Why, he even killed a man
in cold blood for that money.

19:27.909 --> 19:29.149
No!

19:29.169 --> 19:31.727
He was nothing
but a good time Charlie.

19:31.746 --> 19:33.713
I'll kill you!
