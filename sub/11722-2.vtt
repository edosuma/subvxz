<i>The Secret Circle...</i>

00:03.536 --> 00:04.786
Aah!

00:04.788 --> 00:06.288
Cassie.

00:11.044 --> 00:13.128
I'm sorry
about your mom.

00:13.130 --> 00:14.696
Thanks.
Have you seen her yet?

00:14.698 --> 00:16.030
She got in yesterday.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.466
It's ok, Cassie.

00:17.468 --> 00:20.035
We're different.
You're different.

00:20.037 --> 00:23.422
You're a witch. You're
a full blooded, 100% witch.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.206
There's no such thing
as witches and magic.

00:25.208 --> 00:27.208
Are you doing this?

00:27.210 --> 00:29.144
We are.

00:33.983 --> 00:36.651
With her here, we
have real power now.

00:37.904 --> 00:40.439
Each family
has a book,

00:40.441 --> 00:42.858
a journal that lays down each
family line.

00:42.860 --> 00:45.110
A complete circle is 6.

00:45.112 --> 00:46.528
You complete
the circle.

00:46.530 --> 00:47.696
Now we're whole.

00:47.698 --> 00:49.164
You are seriously
messed up.

00:49.166 --> 00:50.732
She's got the gift.

00:50.734 --> 00:53.869
Are you sure you can get
Cassie to do what we need?

00:53.871 --> 00:57.122
The circle will take care of that
without even knowing it.

01:01.427 --> 01:03.762
My sweet Cassie,

01:03.764 --> 01:05.764
I didn't want you
to have this life,

01:05.766 --> 01:09.250
but destiny's not
easy to run from.

01:12.472 --> 01:15.774
You have incredible power
inside you.

01:16.976 --> 01:19.594
People will come for it.

01:19.596 --> 01:21.763
They will come for you.

01:26.435 --> 01:29.538
I hoped that keeping this secret
would keep you safe,

01:29.540 --> 01:31.957
but all I've done
is left you unprotected.

01:35.111 --> 01:36.795
I know how alone
you must feel,

01:36.797 --> 01:38.580
but be careful
who you trust,

01:38.582 --> 01:40.999
even people who
call themselves friends.

01:41.001 --> 01:44.619
Your power is the only thing
that can keep you safe.

02:20.790 --> 02:23.858

03:13.592 --> 03:16.427
You got to go.

03:21.416 --> 03:25.269
Come on, my aunt's
a Jesus freak.

03:25.271 --> 03:26.938
Fine.

03:28.590 --> 03:32.476
Did things work out
with Cassie and you girls?

03:32.478 --> 03:35.446
Us girls?
You're a part of this, too.

03:35.448 --> 03:38.532
No. We think Faye's monsoon
scared the crap out of her.

03:38.534 --> 03:41.369
So are we binding
the circle or not?

03:41.371 --> 03:43.103
I guess not.

03:43.105 --> 03:44.872
I mean, Faye says
it's a bad idea anyway.

03:44.874 --> 03:46.707
Do you always listen
to Faye?

03:46.709 --> 03:49.543
No. Otherwise
I wouldn't be here.

03:49.545 --> 03:51.545
And, you know what,
can you keep this quiet, ok?

03:51.547 --> 03:53.714
I don't want anyone knowing we
hooked up, so don't go bragging.

03:53.716 --> 03:56.083
I'm gonna brag
about you?

03:57.469 --> 03:59.503
You're an ass.

04:13.635 --> 04:16.269
Please.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.741
Do you own a shirt?

04:26.365 --> 04:30.801
Ok, curtains,
you can close now.

04:34.155 --> 04:36.040
Close, now!

04:49.601 --> 04:51.769
Hey, want some
breakfast?

04:51.771 --> 04:53.454
No, I'm late.

04:53.456 --> 04:54.789
Everything ok?

04:54.791 --> 04:57.375
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just frazzled.

04:57.377 --> 04:59.160
Cassie, I know
this isn't easy.

04:59.162 --> 05:01.412
Losing your mother,
moving away from home.

05:01.414 --> 05:03.497
But I'm here

05:03.499 --> 05:06.284
if you want
to talk about anything.

05:08.754 --> 05:11.222
I really am late.

05:43.672 --> 05:45.506
What's the racket
outside?

05:45.508 --> 05:48.092
Sea fair.
It's this weekend.

05:48.094 --> 05:49.260
They're setting up.

05:49.262 --> 05:51.345
We're out of steelhead
and mussels.

05:51.347 --> 05:53.597
No, we're not.
I already called them in.

05:55.600 --> 05:59.387
So what's going on
between you and Diana's dad?

05:59.389 --> 06:02.006
Hmm?

06:02.008 --> 06:04.225
You two almost
went to blows.

06:04.227 --> 06:07.478
Charles Meade's a punk.
He's always been a punk.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.982
Well, that punk is also a lawyer
on the town council, Dad.

06:10.984 --> 06:13.651
So it's probably not
the best idea to piss him off.

06:13.653 --> 06:15.953
And he's Diana's father.

06:17.456 --> 06:19.907
So, please just try
and make an effort, ok?

06:28.800 --> 06:30.167
Faye, we're late.

06:30.169 --> 06:32.770
You don't have to shout.

06:32.772 --> 06:34.204
Is that what
you're wearing?

06:34.206 --> 06:35.473
Do you love it?
It's new.

06:35.475 --> 06:37.558
Exactly how I don't
want you to dress.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.043
You could stand
to lose a button.

06:39.045 --> 06:40.711
I'm the principal.
I have to be buttoned.

06:40.713 --> 06:43.597
Well, then live vicariously
through me.

06:49.554 --> 06:51.555
Granddaddy!

06:51.557 --> 06:53.024
Hey, there, kitten.

06:53.026 --> 06:54.325
What are you
doing here?

06:54.327 --> 06:56.610
It's lonely up at the lake
all by myself.

06:56.612 --> 06:58.612
Dawn.

06:58.614 --> 07:01.732
Henry.

07:01.734 --> 07:03.451
How long
you staying?

07:03.453 --> 07:04.618
I'm not sure yet.

07:04.620 --> 07:06.070
I have some business
to take care of.

07:06.072 --> 07:08.172
You're retired.

07:08.174 --> 07:09.613
And I wanted to see
my granddaughter

07:09.638 --> 07:11.038
and daughter-in-law.

07:11.461 --> 07:15.346
Well, I'm happy
to see you.

07:15.348 --> 07:18.248
So long.

07:18.250 --> 07:21.418
Is everything ok?

07:21.420 --> 07:23.771
If it's not,
I'll let you know.

07:23.773 --> 07:27.058
Well, you're welcome
to stay as long as you'd like.

07:27.060 --> 07:30.861
That's gracious of you,
being it's my home.

07:44.209 --> 07:47.578
Hi, there.
I'm Sally Matthews, class President.

07:47.580 --> 07:49.547
Oh, hi. Cassie.

07:49.549 --> 07:50.664
The new girl.

07:50.666 --> 07:52.249
I just wanted
to welcome you

07:52.251 --> 07:53.667
and see if you
needed anything.

07:53.669 --> 07:56.453
Anything--social,
extracurricular, I'm your girl.

07:56.455 --> 07:58.506
And if you're not
doing anything tomorrow,

07:58.508 --> 08:00.007
you should come
to the fair.

08:00.009 --> 08:01.392
I'm in charge of
the school raffle,

08:01.394 --> 08:03.094
and we really need
new band uniforms.

08:03.096 --> 08:04.595
I could really use
the help.

08:04.597 --> 08:06.514
It's a great way
to meet people.

08:06.516 --> 08:08.298
- Ok, sure.
- Ok.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.184
She's been here
for 5 minutes,

08:10.186 --> 08:11.685
don't torture
the girl yet.

08:11.687 --> 08:13.104
We're talking, Faye.

08:13.106 --> 08:15.139
And I'm
interrupting, Sally.

08:15.141 --> 08:18.142
That Sally Matthews
talks more than I can listen.

08:18.144 --> 08:20.111
Look, I want
to apologize

08:20.113 --> 08:21.645
for what happened
on the dock with the storm.

08:21.647 --> 08:22.997
Things got a little
out of hand.

08:22.999 --> 08:24.982
I wanted to thank
you for stopping it.

08:24.984 --> 08:27.535
With you here,
our powers are magnified,

08:27.537 --> 08:30.621
and it's awesome, but
we have to practice a little.

08:30.623 --> 08:33.424
Has Diana gotten to you yet
about binding the circle?

08:33.426 --> 08:35.509
- Not yet.
- Just say no.

08:35.510 --> 08:38.095
It is exactly what
we don't want to do.

08:38.097 --> 08:39.513
Why not?

08:39.515 --> 08:41.799
It links us together,
all 6 of us.

08:41.801 --> 08:43.717
We won't have
individual power.

08:43.719 --> 08:47.504
It'll become a factious circle with
control freak Diana as dictator.

08:47.506 --> 08:50.307
And I don't want someone telling me
what to eat for lunch,

08:50.309 --> 08:52.143
much less what parade
I can rain on, you know.

08:52.145 --> 08:54.195
No, I don't.
I don't know you,

08:54.197 --> 08:56.564
I don't want to know you,
and I don't want any part of this,

08:56.566 --> 08:58.232
so you need
to leave me alone.

08:58.234 --> 08:59.900
Understand?

09:07.626 --> 09:09.210
Charles Meade.

09:09.212 --> 09:11.462
- Why is Henry in town?
- I don't know.

09:11.464 --> 09:13.380
He's your father-in-law,
not mine.

09:13.382 --> 09:15.416
Could he be onto us?
I doubt that.

09:15.418 --> 09:17.134
We were very careful.
We covered our tracks.

09:17.136 --> 09:19.386
I don't like him here.
I don't trust him at all.

09:19.388 --> 09:21.055
You just don't like him.

09:21.057 --> 09:22.539
'Cause he doesn't like me.

09:22.541 --> 09:24.725
He blames me for Tom's death,
like it was my fault.

09:24.727 --> 09:26.727
We all have to blame
someone.

09:26.729 --> 09:29.647
Keep your eyes open.

09:33.436 --> 09:37.238
So I have two big rules
in my classroom.

09:37.240 --> 09:41.358
Rule number one--
do not breathe in the vapors

09:41.360 --> 09:43.227
of these chemicals.

09:43.229 --> 09:45.562
Rule number two--
always wear goggles.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.736
Ok, let's get it started.

09:52.738 --> 09:54.205
Got a big day today.

09:54.207 --> 09:56.624
First and foremost,
safety goggles on, please.

09:56.626 --> 10:01.078
Afterwards, I want you to pour
300 milliliters of solution "A"

10:01.080 --> 10:04.632
and two drops of solution "B"
into your beakers, please.

10:04.634 --> 10:08.769
Now, take in mind that many of
these carbonates are very toxic,

10:08.771 --> 10:11.255
which, for those you
who don't know,

10:11.257 --> 10:13.090
that means dangerous.

10:13.092 --> 10:15.142
Now, remember that
the point of this experiment

10:15.144 --> 10:17.645
is to compare the reactivity
of these different metal carbonates...

10:21.533 --> 10:24.368
Fire without flame
bring me heat.

10:24.370 --> 10:27.104
- What are you doing?
- Experimenting. Try it.

10:27.106 --> 10:28.739
Fire without flame...

10:28.741 --> 10:30.658
Bring me heat.

10:30.660 --> 10:33.744
- Fire without flame...
- Bring me heat.

10:35.247 --> 10:37.464
Ohh.

10:39.117 --> 10:41.252
As you can see, it's a white salt

10:41.254 --> 10:43.470
soluble in water,
and it's found in bleach,

10:43.472 --> 10:45.589
and it's used as well in the
production of soap and glass.

10:45.591 --> 10:47.841
It's also the primary
component of potash...

11:07.696 --> 11:09.613
Ohh!

11:20.508 --> 11:22.793
Is anyone hurt?

11:30.018 --> 11:32.836
Cassie. Cassie,
wait a minute.

11:32.838 --> 11:34.355
I did that.

11:34.357 --> 11:36.357
I got mad and that's
what happened.

11:36.359 --> 11:38.675
I didn't mean to.

11:38.677 --> 11:41.278
Why is this happening?

11:41.280 --> 11:42.479
How do I stop it?

11:42.481 --> 11:44.648
That's the thing,
you can't.

11:46.735 --> 11:51.238
But if you let me,
I can help.

11:55.307 --> 11:56.473
Why do you guys
come here?

11:57.308 --> 11:59.124
Because
no one else does.

11:59.126 --> 12:00.559
Condemned buildings
are like that.

12:00.561 --> 12:04.013
Well, it's important
that no one find out about us.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.565
Especially our families.

12:08.935 --> 12:11.937
How did you discover--
we're witches?

12:11.939 --> 12:14.273
Diana found her mom's
Book of Shadows.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.692
That's how we know
about all of us.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.411
She's the only one
with a book?

12:19.413 --> 12:21.247
Technically each family
has a book,

12:21.249 --> 12:23.582
but hers is the only one
we have access to.

12:23.584 --> 12:25.417
Why?

12:25.419 --> 12:27.419
Because witchcraft
is forbidden.

12:27.421 --> 12:28.654
It was abolished.

12:28.656 --> 12:30.456
Because of what happened
years ago.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.759
It's when my mom died.

12:33.761 --> 12:35.961
And Diana's mom.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.297
Faye's dad.
Melissa's mom.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.634
Nick lost both
of his parents.

12:43.770 --> 12:46.755
And my dad.

12:49.026 --> 12:51.343
I don't know much
about him.

12:51.345 --> 12:54.196
Just that there was
some big accident.

12:54.198 --> 12:56.372
Well, the official story
was some teens were

12:56.397 --> 12:57.697
partying on an old boat

12:57.702 --> 13:00.018
and there was a fire.

13:00.020 --> 13:01.620
Some didn't get out.

13:01.622 --> 13:03.622
A fire.

13:03.624 --> 13:06.492
Diana thinks it's because
they didn't bind the circle.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.627
I don't understand.

13:08.629 --> 13:11.580
Every witch is born
into a circle.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.415
Ours is made up of
our 6 families.

13:13.417 --> 13:17.035
The circle has more power
than any one person can handle.

13:17.037 --> 13:19.471
Binding it is the only way
we can utilize the power,

13:19.473 --> 13:20.973
but keep it controlled.

13:20.975 --> 13:23.142
Faye says that it will
link us together.

13:23.144 --> 13:26.044
Yes. It will limit
our individual abilities,

13:26.046 --> 13:27.713
but strengthen us
as a group.

13:27.715 --> 13:30.316
That way no one
can have too much power.

13:30.318 --> 13:33.585
It's like living
in a Harry Potter movie.

13:33.587 --> 13:36.655
He has a wand.

13:36.657 --> 13:39.325
It is not all bad.

13:39.327 --> 13:41.393
Just let me show you.

13:45.165 --> 13:47.082
He used a Signa spell.

13:47.084 --> 13:49.251
I nearly drown on
the floor of my own bar.

13:49.253 --> 13:50.703
You were drunk.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.022
I could tell when
you called me last night.

13:53.024 --> 13:57.042
I'd been drinking.
I wasn't drunk.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.577
He used magic.

13:58.579 --> 14:01.180
He tried to threaten me,
Henry.

14:01.182 --> 14:02.965
It's impossible.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.417
Everyone in your circle
was stripped of their power.

14:05.419 --> 14:09.688
I know.
Believe me, I know.

14:09.690 --> 14:12.191
But he's figured out
a way around that.

14:12.193 --> 14:14.610
Why would he be
threatening you?

14:14.612 --> 14:18.647
I was talking to
Cassie Blake about her mother.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.433
He was worried I would
say something stupid.

14:21.435 --> 14:22.601
Did you?

14:22.603 --> 14:26.288
No.

14:26.290 --> 14:28.407
Of course not.

14:33.580 --> 14:34.713
Hey.

14:34.715 --> 14:36.131
Diana,
what happened?

14:36.133 --> 14:37.282
Adam took
the blame.

14:37.284 --> 14:38.467
He said he mixed
the chemicals

14:38.469 --> 14:39.668
and miscalculated
the chloride.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.119
And Mr. Herman
believed him?

14:41.121 --> 14:42.388
He couldn't explain
it any better.

14:42.390 --> 14:44.289
Faye, we got lucky.
No one was hurt.

14:44.291 --> 14:46.425
Now, when are you
gonna get it through your head,

14:46.427 --> 14:48.093
we have to bind
the circle.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.228
Have fun.

14:49.230 --> 14:50.512
Can't you talk
to her?

14:50.514 --> 14:52.147
Maybe we should bind it.

14:52.149 --> 14:53.649
I don't like all this stray energy
floating around.

14:53.651 --> 14:55.184
No.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.635
Not if it means
we'll be linked.

14:56.637 --> 14:58.470
I don't want you to have
a say in what I do.

14:58.472 --> 15:00.272
I don't want you
to control me.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.607
But we'll have
more strength as a group

15:01.609 --> 15:03.275
and can use it
better.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.527
For what, world peace?
Are we gonna save the turtles?

15:05.529 --> 15:07.162
Why can't we just
enjoy it?

15:07.164 --> 15:08.497
Because it's selfish
and dangerous.

15:08.499 --> 15:09.915
Yes, and I'm good
with that.

15:09.917 --> 15:12.868
In fact,
I'm great with it.

15:32.472 --> 15:35.474
Ok, what's this?

15:37.026 --> 15:40.446
Some spells in Diana's book
requires certain herbs

15:40.448 --> 15:42.180
and roots.

15:42.182 --> 15:45.784
We've been experimenting.

16:03.219 --> 16:04.553
Are you crazy?

16:04.555 --> 16:07.205
It's grounded.
I'm holding it right now.

16:07.207 --> 16:10.208
Trust me.

16:29.496 --> 16:31.580
Take my hand.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.621
Heh.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.408
Energy is flowing
from the battery,

16:43.410 --> 16:47.012
through you, to me,

16:47.014 --> 16:49.248
to this.

16:49.250 --> 16:51.767
Heh.

16:54.420 --> 16:56.722
Try it by yourself.

16:59.192 --> 17:03.862
Just concentrate
on the energy.

17:06.065 --> 17:09.401
Feel the flow
inside you.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.770
Focus.

17:13.439 --> 17:16.273
Ok. Breathe...

17:16.276 --> 17:20.127
Slow, deep breaths.

17:20.130 --> 17:21.630
Look at me.

17:44.737 --> 17:46.488
This is a bad idea.

17:46.490 --> 17:49.074
- I'm--I'm sorry.
- No. It's my fault.

17:49.076 --> 17:51.860
I shouldn't have come.

without me?

18:32.674 --> 18:35.291
Of course. Have fun.
I'll see you at home.

18:35.293 --> 18:37.143
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:37.145 --> 18:38.845
I didn't think
you'd come.

18:38.847 --> 18:40.296
I figured
Faye turned you against me.

18:40.298 --> 18:41.981
Faye turned me
against Faye.

18:41.983 --> 18:45.001
Well, we just became friends
in this moment.

18:45.003 --> 18:46.602
So what do I need to do?

18:46.604 --> 18:48.571
It's super easy.
You just have to sell tickets.

18:48.573 --> 18:49.822
Ok. Great.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.741

He broke
my concentration.

19:18.186 --> 19:20.019
Ok, I'm bored.

19:20.021 --> 19:21.854
Let's turn it up
a notch.

19:28.113 --> 19:31.230

- Oh. Hee hee.

19:33.485 --> 19:35.201
How did you get
roped into volunteering?

19:35.203 --> 19:38.854
I'm here for
the distraction.

19:38.856 --> 19:41.708
Adam told me
you guys practiced last night.

19:41.710 --> 19:46.662
I'm happy to help
some time if you want.

19:46.664 --> 19:48.915
The thing is,
we need you.

19:48.917 --> 19:50.866
We can't be a circle
without you.

19:50.868 --> 19:53.636
I'm sorry. You're gonna have
to find someone else.

19:53.638 --> 19:55.138
There is
no one else.

19:55.140 --> 19:56.872
You're one of
the 6 families.

19:56.874 --> 19:58.040
I thought you
understood that.

19:58.042 --> 20:00.093
No, I don't understand
any of this.

20:00.095 --> 20:01.811
What you're asking
is ludicrous.

20:01.813 --> 20:04.046
I can't just blindly
agree to it.

20:04.048 --> 20:05.314
I know it's a lot
to accept.

20:05.316 --> 20:07.716
It's too much.
I can't.

20:07.718 --> 20:09.018
You're scared.

20:09.020 --> 20:10.820
Of course I'm scared.
Who wouldn't be?

20:10.822 --> 20:12.905
Look, I...

20:12.907 --> 20:15.558
I have a feeling,
and then things explode.

20:15.560 --> 20:17.577
Which is why we need
to bind the circle.

20:17.579 --> 20:20.229
Our energies are flying
everywhere all at once

20:20.231 --> 20:21.897
with no rhyme
or reason.

20:21.899 --> 20:25.368
We have to contain it before
someone gets really hurt.

20:26.787 --> 20:31.257
I'm sorry. I don't think that
I can help you.

20:37.631 --> 20:39.918
Please note that no
black cauldron was used in

20:39.943 --> 20:41.462
the making of this potion.

20:41.603 --> 20:42.969
Open up.

20:43.971 --> 20:45.221
Mmm.
What's in it?

20:45.223 --> 20:46.773
All natural herbs
and spices.

20:46.775 --> 20:48.090
Just boiled down to liquid.

20:48.092 --> 20:49.308
I tasted them.
And...

20:49.310 --> 20:50.810
And you got this
from Diana's book?

20:50.812 --> 20:52.145
Will it work?

20:54.782 --> 20:56.649
Are you gonna
try it?

20:56.651 --> 20:57.900
No, I'm good.
Thanks.

20:57.902 --> 20:59.902
So what do I tell
Diana, huh?

20:59.904 --> 21:02.572
She won't stop with
the binding ritual crap.

21:02.574 --> 21:04.907
You tell her to shove her ritual
up her hoo-ha.

21:07.778 --> 21:10.713
Everything's been out of whack
since Cassie got here.

21:10.715 --> 21:13.082
You know she busted my window,
completely shattered it.

21:13.084 --> 21:14.550
You know, I think
we should listen to Diana.

21:14.552 --> 21:15.968
She's the one with
the rule book.

21:15.970 --> 21:18.054
We just need
to practice more.

21:18.056 --> 21:21.290
More power requires
more practice.

21:21.292 --> 21:23.792
You started a monsoon
and couldn't stop it.

21:23.794 --> 21:27.180
Oh. Could we all
just let that go?

21:37.241 --> 21:40.243
Mmm.

21:53.924 --> 21:56.175
Enjoying yourself,
Henry?

21:56.177 --> 21:59.828
Ethan Conant said Charles Meade
threatened him with magic.

22:02.516 --> 22:04.800
He said Charles used
the signa on him

22:04.802 --> 22:08.003
when he overheard him talking to
Cassie Blake about her mother.

22:08.005 --> 22:09.672
I don't believe it.

22:09.674 --> 22:11.607
Ethan isn't exactly
a reliable source.

22:11.609 --> 22:12.841
He's an alcoholic.

22:12.843 --> 22:15.344
And Charles, he doesn't
have any power.

22:15.346 --> 22:16.696
None of us do.

22:16.698 --> 22:18.648
Your circle took care
of that.

22:18.650 --> 22:20.349
I'd be inclined
to agree with you,

22:20.351 --> 22:21.984
except I've witnessed it.

22:21.986 --> 22:25.621
Henry, nobody
is practicing.

22:25.623 --> 22:26.855
Those days are over.

22:26.857 --> 22:29.792
The children.
I saw them today.

22:29.794 --> 22:31.827
Your own daughter
is one of them.

22:31.829 --> 22:34.046
Faye?

22:34.048 --> 22:35.631
With the Blake girl
back in town,

22:35.633 --> 22:37.300
they have a complete circle.

22:37.302 --> 22:39.635
They can awaken
to their full potential.

22:39.637 --> 22:41.203
We have to stop them.

22:41.205 --> 22:42.705
They don't know
anything.

22:42.707 --> 22:44.757
We've kept this
from them.

22:44.759 --> 22:46.676
I'm gonna take care of it.

22:46.678 --> 22:49.595
I swore I would never let what
happened to your circle

22:49.597 --> 22:50.846
ever happen again.

22:50.848 --> 22:53.232
Henry, stop.

22:53.234 --> 22:55.768
Look, I know we've
had our differences,

22:55.770 --> 22:57.886
but I lost my husband.

22:57.888 --> 23:01.240
I'm not about to let something
happen to Faye.

23:01.242 --> 23:03.726
Let me help you.

23:05.913 --> 23:08.447
Tell me what I can do.

23:12.002 --> 23:13.119
What were you thinking?

23:13.121 --> 23:14.737
That he wouldn't
say anything?

23:14.739 --> 23:16.172
Use your head.

23:16.174 --> 23:18.007
I may have gone
too far,

23:18.009 --> 23:20.743
but we can't have Ethan running
his mouth off about Amelia.

23:20.745 --> 23:23.012
He could blow it for us.

23:23.014 --> 23:25.181
No, you've already
taken care of that.

23:25.183 --> 23:26.966
What are we gonna do
about Henry?

23:26.968 --> 23:29.602
You're not gonna do anything
except give me that crystal.

23:29.604 --> 23:32.021
That is all the power
we have.

23:32.023 --> 23:34.089
If we use it up,
we have nothing.

23:34.091 --> 23:35.691
We can't waste it.

23:35.693 --> 23:37.310
Ok.

23:37.312 --> 23:41.063
You made your point.

23:44.934 --> 23:47.119
Look, I get it.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.255
It feels good
to do magic again.

23:49.257 --> 23:51.157
It's seductive.

23:51.159 --> 23:54.327
But we have to be
smart, Charles.

23:54.329 --> 23:57.830
Just think of
the bigger picture.

24:21.153 --> 24:23.048
Hey, Cassie.

24:23.049 --> 24:24.649
Hey.

24:24.651 --> 24:26.485
How you doing?

24:28.404 --> 24:32.824
Um, the other night you were
telling me about my mom.

24:32.826 --> 24:36.328
You caught me drinking.

24:36.330 --> 24:39.414
I'm sorry if I said
anything inappropriate.

24:39.416 --> 24:42.400
You said our
families are aligned.

24:42.402 --> 24:43.835
What did you mean?

24:45.839 --> 24:48.573
There's this old legend
about our families.

24:48.575 --> 24:52.711
Some astrological lore
about the two of us

24:52.713 --> 24:55.430
on some collision course
of destiny.

24:55.432 --> 24:57.299
It's silly.

24:57.301 --> 24:59.801
I've never really believed
in astrology.

24:59.803 --> 25:01.469
Me either.

25:02.688 --> 25:04.773
To be honest,

25:04.775 --> 25:09.060
I just know that whenever
I was around your mother

25:09.062 --> 25:11.396
I'd get this feeling.

25:11.398 --> 25:16.034
This attraction to her
that was impossible to ignore.

25:16.036 --> 25:19.037
All she had to do
was look at me

25:19.039 --> 25:22.908
and smile just right,
and I'd light up inside.

25:24.627 --> 25:26.745
No one else could do that.

25:29.348 --> 25:31.967
Like I said...

25:31.969 --> 25:33.635
It's silly.

25:33.637 --> 25:38.640
Uh, no.
Not at all.

25:39.959 --> 25:46.915
♪ I can't believe
I can't let it go ♪

25:50.603 --> 25:51.820
♪ difference made... ♪

25:51.822 --> 25:53.188
Hey.

25:56.859 --> 25:58.860
Hey.

26:02.365 --> 26:05.584
So I've been asked to come
over here and convince you

26:05.586 --> 26:08.319
to bind the circle.

26:08.321 --> 26:10.755
Yeah. She kind of
struck out.

26:10.757 --> 26:11.923
Yeah.

26:11.925 --> 26:15.377
Yeah, so I heard.

26:15.379 --> 26:21.132
What did you tell
Diana about last night?

26:22.602 --> 26:26.805
That I showed you how to focus
and harness your energy.

26:26.807 --> 26:30.108
She's ok with that.

26:33.779 --> 26:38.483
Does it always feel
like last night?

26:43.039 --> 26:47.993
There's always some
physical reaction.

26:47.995 --> 26:53.048
You know what I mean.

26:57.870 --> 27:00.472
Ok, so if we bind
the circle,

27:00.474 --> 27:03.341
then we'll be able
to control it better?

27:03.343 --> 27:05.310
Yes.

27:05.312 --> 27:08.930
No more exploding
light bulbs or floating water?

27:12.601 --> 27:15.687
I don't think so.

27:27.566 --> 27:29.034
Look at them.

27:29.036 --> 27:31.369
They're like little
goldfish stuck together.

27:31.371 --> 27:33.237
Shut up, Faye.

27:33.239 --> 27:37.008
Seriously, Diana, you are two
minutes away from losing him.

27:37.010 --> 27:38.760
I want to bind
the circle tonight.

27:38.762 --> 27:39.961
I'm busy.

27:39.963 --> 27:42.297
Faye, use your head.
You know we have to.

27:42.299 --> 27:45.083
Oh, I'd prioritize
if I were you.

27:45.085 --> 27:48.136
You've got a bigger problem.

28:17.282 --> 28:19.951
Stop groping.
It's not gonna happen.

28:19.953 --> 28:21.669
Why are you fighting?
Just go with it.

28:21.671 --> 28:24.723
Do you honestly think that
I would get with you?

28:24.725 --> 28:26.091
Ha ha.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.402
Would you hit that?

28:37.404 --> 28:39.854
I'd have to leave
my self-esteem at the door.

28:52.368 --> 28:54.619
Hey, Cassie.
What you doing?

28:54.621 --> 28:56.454
I'm looking
for Sally.

28:56.456 --> 28:57.705
She's a bore.

28:57.707 --> 28:59.824
Hey, what do you say
you and me do a little magic?

28:59.826 --> 29:00.992
I don't think so.

29:00.994 --> 29:02.660
Like start another storm.

29:02.662 --> 29:04.879
This time you start it
and I'll stop it.

29:04.881 --> 29:06.431
That's not funny.
You could have killed somebody

29:06.433 --> 29:07.599
with that storm.

29:07.601 --> 29:09.350
Fine, we'll do
something else then.

29:09.352 --> 29:11.302
You pick.
Think big.

29:11.304 --> 29:13.438
Get away from me.

29:14.523 --> 29:16.274
You did that.

29:16.276 --> 29:19.010
You're a little fire cracker,
aren't you, Cassie?

29:19.012 --> 29:21.012
I don't want to
start this with you.

29:23.283 --> 29:26.350
Faye, please, don't.

29:26.352 --> 29:29.320
Come on, it's a total rush
and you know it.

29:29.322 --> 29:31.956
- It's too risky.
- Then stop me.

29:35.044 --> 29:36.461
Stop it.

29:38.331 --> 29:40.531
Stop it!

29:42.384 --> 29:44.385
Excuse me,

29:44.387 --> 29:45.887
little miss telekinesis.

29:45.889 --> 29:47.422
Hey, what's going on?

29:47.424 --> 29:49.340
Not now, Sally.

29:49.342 --> 29:50.842
Yes, now, Faye.

29:50.844 --> 29:53.645
I am so sick of your
superiority complex.

29:53.647 --> 29:55.680
Ok, Sally, why
don't we just--

29:55.682 --> 29:57.398
Get off, Faye.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.218
No. You go away.

30:16.568 --> 30:18.253
Faye, what did you do?

30:20.756 --> 30:23.675
She's not breathing!

30:28.528 --> 30:29.860
Somebody call
an ambulance.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.862
I called already.
They're on their way.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.253
Step back.
Ok, ok.

30:39.255 --> 30:41.422
Step back.

31:00.892 --> 31:03.861
It's ok. It's ok.
No, no, no. Don't move.

31:19.661 --> 31:22.213
You used
the crystal.

31:23.531 --> 31:25.249
I thought we weren't
gonna waste it.

31:25.251 --> 31:29.870
We don't kill
innocent children.

31:29.872 --> 31:32.840
You have a very interesting
set of rules there, Dawn.

31:32.842 --> 31:35.309
You'll have to
explain them to me sometime.

31:35.311 --> 31:39.180
It was Faye's fault.
She's my daughter.

31:39.182 --> 31:42.716
That kind of guilt
would have destroyed her.

31:42.718 --> 31:46.771
What would you have done
if it were Diana?

31:55.664 --> 31:58.299
The paramedic said
she's gonna be ok.

32:02.237 --> 32:06.724
I didn't mean for
anyone to get hurt.

32:06.726 --> 32:10.027
I really didn't.

32:11.797 --> 32:14.548
With you here,
we can do more.

32:14.550 --> 32:17.802
I just have to will
things and they happen.

32:17.804 --> 32:20.421
We can't let our feelings
control us like this.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.357
But I like...

32:26.194 --> 32:30.114
I don't want this
to go away.

32:35.904 --> 32:38.605
We don't have a choice.

32:38.607 --> 32:41.042
It's too dangerous.

32:41.044 --> 32:44.211
If we can't control
what we feel or what we think,

32:44.213 --> 32:46.447
we're just gonna keep
hurting people.

32:48.116 --> 32:49.533
I don't want to be
connected to you

32:49.535 --> 32:51.469
anymore than you
want to be to me.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.172
But no one else
can get hurt.

32:55.174 --> 32:57.258
It's wrong.

32:59.010 --> 33:01.262
Diana's right.

33:01.264 --> 33:04.815
We have to bind the circle.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.820
We'll be at
the beach at midnight.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.087
It was Charles
that threw me.

33:26.089 --> 33:29.840
At first I thought he pushed
the children to form a circle

33:29.842 --> 33:34.011
and then used their power
to somehow reestablish his.

33:34.013 --> 33:38.032
But then I realized
Charles Meade is many things,

33:38.034 --> 33:40.734
clever is not
one of them.

33:40.736 --> 33:43.437
And then I saw you.

33:45.173 --> 33:48.976
You couldn't have saved that
girl tonight without a crystal.

33:48.978 --> 33:52.029
Where'd you get it?
They were all destroyed.

33:53.298 --> 33:55.850
It's wrong of you
to strip us of our power.

33:55.852 --> 33:57.935
There was a time
for witchcraft.

33:57.937 --> 33:59.804
Time is long gone.

33:59.806 --> 34:02.990
There's no place for it
in this world anymore.

34:02.992 --> 34:06.043
You've forgotten
what it feels like.

34:06.045 --> 34:09.179
How long has it been
since you practiced, 15 years?

34:09.181 --> 34:11.815
This circle
is different.

34:11.818 --> 34:15.985
You know what can be unleashed
if they bind together.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.822
I'm going to
the elders tomorrow

34:17.824 --> 34:20.306
and tell them what's
going on here.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.309
Give me the crystal.

34:35.790 --> 34:38.876
You know, Henry,
I've got a better idea.

34:41.963 --> 34:45.498
I think you should go back
to the lake and take it easy.

34:49.286 --> 34:52.422
It'd be awful if you had
another heart attack.

35:00.081 --> 35:02.967
You might not
survive it this time.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.058
You should know...

35:15.030 --> 35:17.431

Ok.

35:56.701 --> 36:00.235
Well, you did it.

36:00.237 --> 36:03.539
You convinced her
to bind the circle with us.

36:03.541 --> 36:06.458
I don't know what to do expect.
Do you?

36:06.460 --> 36:08.276
No, not really.

36:08.278 --> 36:11.430
So how do we know
it'll work?

36:11.432 --> 36:12.865
I don't know, Adam.

36:12.867 --> 36:14.867
I just found

or anyone else.

What's going on?

36:25.479 --> 36:26.996
Nothing.

36:31.801 --> 36:35.637
I don't know
what I'm doing.

36:35.639 --> 36:40.192
I pretend like I do,
but...

36:43.446 --> 36:47.783
Do I have anything to worry
about with you and Cassie?

36:48.785 --> 36:50.836
Why would you
ask that?

36:50.838 --> 36:54.707
Because I'm insecure.

36:54.709 --> 36:58.210
And I love you.

37:00.797 --> 37:03.015
Come here.

37:06.803 --> 37:09.471
I love you, too.

37:32.962 --> 37:34.913
You're home.

37:37.584 --> 37:40.636
Your grandfather drove back to
the lake tonight.

37:40.638 --> 37:43.922
He said to tell you
good-bye.

37:43.924 --> 37:46.558
What happened
tonight?

37:46.560 --> 37:49.144
Were you drinking?

37:53.299 --> 37:57.436
Things got a little
out of hand.

37:59.439 --> 38:02.741
I'm the high school
principal in this town.

38:02.743 --> 38:05.010
It's how people see me.

38:05.012 --> 38:06.912
What do you think runs
through their minds

38:06.914 --> 38:08.480
after something
like tonight?

38:08.482 --> 38:12.000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to embarrass you.

38:12.002 --> 38:14.569
You embarrassed
yourself.

38:22.679 --> 38:24.412
Come here.

38:25.716 --> 38:29.134
That girl could have
been you tonight.

38:33.473 --> 38:36.775
Everything's gonna
be ok, mom.

38:45.652 --> 38:47.736
Get in.
I'll take you there.

38:47.738 --> 38:49.571
I'm good.

38:50.707 --> 38:52.624
Seriously,
I want to walk.

38:52.626 --> 38:54.442
I like it.

38:54.444 --> 38:55.994
It's a nice night.

38:55.996 --> 38:57.496
Come on,
we're friends now.

38:57.498 --> 39:00.582
Sure. Friends bound
for eternity.

39:00.584 --> 39:02.450
Totally normal.

39:02.452 --> 39:04.670
It's the right thing
to do, you know.

39:04.672 --> 39:06.054
For all of us.

39:06.056 --> 39:10.458
I hope so.

39:10.460 --> 39:13.762
So, ok, friend thing
settled.

39:13.764 --> 39:16.265
Get in already.

39:16.267 --> 39:17.900
The beach
is 2 miles away,

39:17.902 --> 39:21.069
and I promised Diana
I'd bring you.

By these elements,
we bind the circle

40:38.649 --> 40:41.066
and follow in the footsteps
of our ancestors

40:41.068 --> 40:42.684
who pledged
themselves to fight

40:42.686 --> 40:44.886
against the forces
of darkness.

40:52.112 --> 40:55.697
in the circle we will
find out power.

40:55.699 --> 40:59.785
We come to this place
alone, but leave bound as one.

40:59.787 --> 41:04.239
With this oath,
our journey begins together.
