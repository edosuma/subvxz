00:01.569 --> 00:03.737
-The Lyons are
hitting back on Empire.
-(shouts)

00:03.771 --> 00:06.174
-May we rise.
-Like we always do.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.211
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.244 --> 00:13.081
Star, 9-1-1, and The Resident.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.215
That's a win-win.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.820
-Previously on Empire...
-I'm gonna help you

00:19.853 --> 00:21.555
-get out of here.
-Someone confessed
to the robbery.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.724
-So Quincy's getting out?
-(laughs): Yeah!

00:23.757 --> 00:25.993
I'm not here to talk about all
your past daddy issues, Jeff.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.496
-I am here to talk
about my future.
-So Empire's data mining?

00:28.529 --> 00:30.664
He's selling it
to law enforcement.

00:30.698 --> 00:31.999
"256 Mercer."

00:32.032 --> 00:34.268
Your name is on the deed
of trust.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.703
-You a bird, Tee.
-Get out of my way.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.771
-Where you going?
-Don't stand over my son
like that.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.007
-Stop it!
-Everything we did was a lie!

00:40.040 --> 00:41.875
All of our relationship
is a lie!

00:41.909 --> 00:43.177
Give me my son back!

00:43.211 --> 00:46.247
Tata, Tata, look what I found.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.551
-Bella, put it down.
-Right here.

00:50.584 --> 00:53.121
-Put it down, baby.
-Give it to Grandma,
Bella, please.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.855
-(gasps)
-TIANA: Put it down, baby.
Don't...

00:54.888 --> 00:56.624
-No, no, no, no, no.
-No, no, no. Give it to Grandma.

00:56.657 --> 00:57.925
-HAKEEM: Bella, come here.
-TIANA: Put it down, baby.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.127
Bella, get over here right now.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.294
COOKIE:
Give it to me, baby.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.696
Everybody just, just be quiet.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.398
-(shushes)
-TIANA (whispers): Bella.

01:04.432 --> 01:05.766
LUCIOUS (quietly):
Hey, baby.

01:07.301 --> 01:10.371
* Twinkle, twinkle

01:10.404 --> 01:12.206
* Little star

01:12.240 --> 01:16.076
* How I wonder what you are

01:16.110 --> 01:19.046
* Up above

01:19.079 --> 01:21.982
* The world so high

01:22.015 --> 01:26.086
* Like a giant in the sky

01:26.120 --> 01:27.221
(sighs)

01:27.255 --> 01:28.756
* Twinkle, twinkle

01:28.789 --> 01:32.726
* Little star...

01:32.760 --> 01:37.465
-Oh, God.
-* How I wonder what you are.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.433
*

01:44.305 --> 01:45.939
(Tiana sighs)

01:45.973 --> 01:48.642
I let myself get pulled
in so many different directions

01:48.676 --> 01:50.511
-that I almost let...
-No, no, no, no.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.313
Come here, come here,
sweetheart.

01:52.346 --> 01:56.450
No, this is not
your fault, okay?

01:56.484 --> 01:58.519
And it is not your fault, Bella.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.787
(sighs)

01:59.820 --> 02:03.457
If anything,
we tried to sell y'all

02:03.491 --> 02:07.528
on that "ride or die" stuff,
treating y'all like y'all

02:07.561 --> 02:10.198
were some kind
of Cookie and Lucious 2.0.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.766
LUCIOUS:
This whole thing got me feeling

02:12.800 --> 02:15.436
like it's all my fault.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.771
I practically raised y'all
around guns,

02:17.805 --> 02:21.542
and I've been strapped
since I was 12 years old, son.

02:21.575 --> 02:25.846
Can you imagine, in the sixth
grade, having a gun?

02:25.879 --> 02:28.182
I just think I need to be
by myself right now.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.218
Boy, sit your ass down.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.952
I'm talking to you.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.289
Now, I carried out of necessity.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.824
Me and your mama,
we lived that life

02:36.857 --> 02:39.827
so that you and your brothers
wouldn't have to.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.896
But as it turns out,
everyone in our family

02:42.930 --> 02:46.434
got blood on their hands
except you, Hakeem.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.670
Which means, man, it's time
for me and your mama

02:49.703 --> 02:52.406
to really think about
some of the karma

02:52.440 --> 02:54.508
that we got coming to us.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.645
But it's not too late for you
to pull yourself together.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.180
COOKIE:
We were so wrong.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.983
Just wrong.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.886
Ride or die is a lie.

03:05.919 --> 03:10.057
It traps you in absolutes
when the truth is,

03:10.090 --> 03:15.229
we grow and we change and need
different things along the way.

03:16.697 --> 03:21.235
(sighs) What you need to do
is take care of you...

03:22.970 --> 03:26.507
...and Bella and Prince.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.176
Let Hakeem do Hakeem.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.513
This family is busy taking

03:32.546 --> 03:35.516
one step forward
and two steps back.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.518
(sighs)

03:37.551 --> 03:39.520
LUCIOUS:
Clean your house, son.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.855
It doesn't have to become
a vicious cycle,

03:41.889 --> 03:44.725
unless you make it one.

03:44.758 --> 03:48.696
But you got to keep
moving forward, okay?

03:48.729 --> 03:54.101
And just...
maybe Hakeem will catch up.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.103
You hear me?

03:56.136 --> 03:58.639
Mm-hmm.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.324
Babe, what the hell?
Come on back to bed.

04:16.357 --> 04:20.661
I'm just finishing
the final cut.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.563
Mal, everything your dad
gave me about

04:22.596 --> 04:25.098
Kingsley's data mining
has checked out.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.568
Getting involved in Lyon family
drama is not smart.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.771
So if you're trying to impress
my dad, please don't.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.541
Ah, I'm not doing this
for your dad-- get off me.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.611
You're going after
his enemy's jugular, homie.

04:37.645 --> 04:42.149
I'm just following
where the story leads.

04:42.182 --> 04:44.318
Of course I want
your dad to like me,

04:44.352 --> 04:46.920
but I'm also a journalist.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.522
Mm-hmm.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.759
Empire has been selling

04:51.792 --> 04:53.594
its users' data
to the highest bidder.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.597
Jeff Kingsley has been allowing
law enforcement to track

04:56.630 --> 04:59.500
and follow Empire XStream
customers without a warrant.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.603
This is a huge breach
in public trust.

05:02.636 --> 05:06.139
You're cute. And you're right.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.442
Can you, uh, finish saving
the world and come back to bed,

05:08.476 --> 05:09.610
-please?
-One second.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.745
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Please.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.984
-(computer whooshes)
-There.

05:17.017 --> 05:20.654
-World saved. Okay?
-World saved.

05:30.598 --> 05:33.467
Now what exactly
were we fighting about?

05:33.501 --> 05:36.737
It's a two bedroom condo,
Mr. Thomas Crown Affair.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.373
Look, we just dodged
a bullet, literally,

05:39.407 --> 05:41.709
and you want to sit up here
and argue

05:41.742 --> 05:45.879
over 2,000 square feet
right now? Please.

05:45.913 --> 05:49.883
Yeah, but you and me, we got,
we got things we need to fix.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.753
Damn right we got things
we need to fix.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.923
You know, all this craziness

05:55.956 --> 05:59.927
is because no one
in this family feels secure.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.497
And we won't until
our future is secure.

06:03.531 --> 06:06.099
Until LFM is secure.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.902
Wait, so you and me,
we just about money now, right?

06:08.936 --> 06:12.540
Ugh, Lucious, I love you, okay?
You know that.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.842
But love don't pay
the bills, man.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.412
(chuckles)
And until our future is secure,

06:18.446 --> 06:20.848
we got to be all
about the money. Okay?

06:20.881 --> 06:25.018
So that means landing
label deals and sponsorships

06:25.052 --> 06:27.521
for all of our artists.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.524
Because if we don't, Lucious...

06:30.558 --> 06:32.760
-(sighs)
-We lose everything.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.127
Yes.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.697
Baby, I'm sorry.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.899
Mm-hmm.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.968
It's just all this Kingsley,
knocking down everything...

06:41.001 --> 06:42.570
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.639
Please, please don't mention
his name to me again.

06:45.673 --> 06:48.141
Lucious, I need you
to focus on this showcase.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.911
Can you do that for me? Please.

06:55.282 --> 06:58.151
(Cookie moans)

07:02.523 --> 07:04.892
GISELLE:
So here's how I see it, Jeff.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.662
I run Empire,
or tomorrow's front page

07:08.696 --> 07:11.098
tells the world about
the littlest Lyon cub.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.067
-Eldest.
-Oh, sorry.

07:14.101 --> 07:18.939
I don't like to be blackmailed,
but I've got to give it to you.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.775
You've opened my eyes
to exactly what the two of us

07:21.809 --> 07:23.577
would be capable of together.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.580
These are a lot of words, Jeff,
and I just need one.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.617
Yes or no.

07:31.318 --> 07:33.286
Yes.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.123
With a caveat.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.160
Be my co-CEO.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.962
Ha.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.931
I've laid a whole lot
of landmines around here,

07:43.964 --> 07:47.267
and you are going to step
in all of them without my help.

07:47.300 --> 07:53.006
But together, we can run Empire
and destroy Lucious Lyon.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.108
Thick or thin.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.210
Sink or swim.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.181
Deal?

08:03.016 --> 08:07.154
What's the company policy about
drinking champagne before noon?

08:14.061 --> 08:17.698
("Jingle Bells"
playing on piano)

08:17.731 --> 08:19.700
TERI:
Here we go.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.670
And...

08:22.703 --> 08:24.538
Welcome home, Quincy.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.806
Wow.
(chuckles)

08:25.839 --> 08:27.675
Oh, you got a tree.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.543
That's right.

08:29.577 --> 08:32.813
Merry Christmas, son.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.148
It's not even Christmas yet.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.050
TERI: Well, open it anyway.
It feels like it to me.

08:37.084 --> 08:41.154
My son is home,
fully exonerated.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.223
Thanks to you, Andre.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.893
And the man who stepped forward
and admitted to the crime.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.227
Now, you need to stop that.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.562
I know what you did to help me,

08:48.596 --> 08:50.698
I know what you did
to help my son.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.066
And so, you need to hear this:

08:53.100 --> 08:57.137
you are a blessing to us.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.007
Open it, man.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.610
(chuckles)

09:12.586 --> 09:14.087
"Welcome home.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.056
Anything. Anywhere."

09:16.089 --> 09:19.126
Anything.
What do you want to do?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.797
-Hot dogs, at the beach.
-(chuckles)

09:23.831 --> 09:26.033
The beach? In December?

09:26.066 --> 09:27.267
Yeah.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.937
That sounds perfect.

09:29.970 --> 09:35.142
And I have all of tomorrow off,
so we can make a full day of it.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.112
Listen, I should, uh, get going.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.682
Welcome home, soldier.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.686
TERI: Why don't you
join us tomorrow?

09:48.588 --> 09:52.292
I mean, I-I got a lot of work
to catch up on, but, um,

09:52.325 --> 09:56.163
if you need anything,
you know, call me.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.767
Thank you, Andre.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.569
Yep. Later, Quince.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.237
All right, man.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.774
Come here, come here, come here.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.608
Aw!
(laughs)

10:08.642 --> 10:11.779
And make sure it's V.S.O.P.,
because we can't have people

10:11.812 --> 10:15.816
complaining about
we had cheap liquor sponsors.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.485
-Are you getting all of this?
-You see me taking notes?

10:18.518 --> 10:22.155
Yeah, I don't see nothing.
I see that tree ain't finished.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.291
What is all of this?

10:24.324 --> 10:26.493
-Watch our boy do his thing.
-...the Empire.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.595
Has the once African
American-owned Empire

10:28.628 --> 10:31.164
become a law enforcement weapon
used to surveil

10:31.198 --> 10:32.700
its black and brown customers?

10:32.733 --> 10:34.702
Empire has been gathering
customer data:

10:34.735 --> 10:35.969
user preferences,

10:36.003 --> 10:38.005
spending habits,
even geo-tracking,

10:38.038 --> 10:39.840
and selling it
to the highest bidder.

10:39.873 --> 10:43.310
Tech companies have been selling
your info for over 20 years.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.045
Their customers are usually
other companies

10:45.078 --> 10:46.780
wanting to sell you something.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.348
But after investigating
the shadow entities

10:48.381 --> 10:50.517
paying top dollar for your info,

10:50.550 --> 10:53.887
we have discovered Empire's
biggest client.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.488
Law enforcement.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.025
-Officials have been...
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.160
Damn, why it got to be po-po?

11:00.193 --> 11:02.896
And if you're wondering
who's responsible,

11:02.930 --> 11:04.798
Silicon Valley superstar,

11:04.832 --> 11:06.666
recently-appointed CEO of Empire

11:06.700 --> 11:09.036
and the mastermind
behind the whole operation...

11:09.069 --> 11:11.371
Jeff Kingsley.

11:13.573 --> 11:16.543
Kingsley, a graduate
of Stanford University

11:16.576 --> 11:18.078
and right-hand man
to Kelly Patel...

11:18.111 --> 11:20.714
-Bye, bitch!
-(all laughing)

11:20.748 --> 11:23.550
That's what he gets
for putting my music in a vault.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.253
Yeah, and y'all can thank
my fiancé, mine.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.687
-Yeah, yeah, he did his thing.
-All right.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.357
-He did it.
-So are we all happy now?

11:30.390 --> 11:32.192
-Yeah, it's a start.
-What you mean, it's a start?

11:32.225 --> 11:34.728
It's a finish.
That's the end of that chapter.

11:34.762 --> 11:37.030
The end, okay?
We're starting a new one.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.598
LFM Management, okay?

11:38.631 --> 11:40.901
And hey, aren't you
supposed to be at rehearsal?

11:40.934 --> 11:42.770
-We're having a Lyon moment.
-No, you standing up here

11:42.803 --> 11:45.005
drooling at the TV, at him,
like a bobblehead.

11:45.038 --> 11:45.939
Oh, come on.

11:45.973 --> 11:47.607
Get your big bubblehead-ass
out of here.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.110
-We was having a good time, man.
You're just a buzzkill.
-Daddy...

11:50.143 --> 11:53.013
You know what?
You can keep shoving food

11:53.046 --> 11:55.749
in your fat piehole.

11:55.783 --> 11:58.752
That's sexy.
Nubby leg and a fat gut.

11:58.786 --> 12:01.789
-Keep talking, see what happens.
-What you say?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.891
-Nothing.
-Mm-hmm.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.896
Now, I want,
I want you to just focus.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.898
(reporters clamoring)

12:10.931 --> 12:12.599
I don't know what's worse:

12:12.632 --> 12:14.467
the data mining or selling
customer info to the government.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.036
I had nothing to do with this.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.405
This is entirely Lucious Lyon.
His son is shacked up

12:18.438 --> 12:20.540
with this hack reporter
that ran the story.

12:20.573 --> 12:25.045
Save it. This little sideshow is
now damaging the parent company.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.947
I've got brand partners
jumping ship

12:26.980 --> 12:28.315
like it's sinking and on fire.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.749
All I need to know is which one

12:29.783 --> 12:31.418
of you is gonna
fall on their sword.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.953
GISELLE:
First thing is damage control.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.387
I'll have publicity

12:34.421 --> 12:36.790
draft a letter
that I will deliver myself.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.391
Can you have media relations
increase bandwidth

12:38.425 --> 12:40.127
-on your end?
-Yeah. What do you need?

12:40.160 --> 12:41.929
Oh. I need
your entire press corps.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.630
What do you have to say?

12:43.663 --> 12:45.632
When I find the person
responsible for this,

12:45.665 --> 12:48.768
I will bring you his head
on a platter. I swear.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.670
You better.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.505
Let's go.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.315
CHOREOGRAPHER: Okay, here we go.
So let's take it from the top.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.417
-With some attitude, ladies.
-BROOKE:
No, they keep messing up.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.485
That's how I've been doing it.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.420
Five, six, seven, eight.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.655
One... No, no, no.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.157
-I need you to start upstage...
-Eight. Five, six,

13:10.190 --> 13:11.158
-seven, eight.
-(snaps fingers)

13:11.191 --> 13:12.425
Get it together. Fix it.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.760
-You don't have to...
-He's telling me...

13:13.793 --> 13:15.028
CHOREOGRAPHER:
Five, six, seven...

13:15.062 --> 13:15.963
(light crashes)

13:15.996 --> 13:17.364
-(people gasping)
-MAN: Sorry about that.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.332
If another one of you chumps

13:19.366 --> 13:23.003
drop another light fixture,
just-just drive me back

13:23.036 --> 13:25.538
to prison, 'cause I'm gonna
commit mass murder up in here!

13:25.572 --> 13:29.309
No, you're not, 'cause I'm
not putting on no gorilla suit

13:29.342 --> 13:31.111
to get your crazy ass out.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.846
-Give me a kiss.
-MAYA: Okay,

13:32.880 --> 13:34.281
let's-let's try it again.
Try it again.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.349
You finished stomping
on Kingsley?

13:36.383 --> 13:38.018
Can I have your attention now?

13:38.051 --> 13:40.720
-I am all yours.
-Well, look here, I'm trying

13:40.753 --> 13:42.789
to get these left-footed
knuckleheads into shape,

13:42.822 --> 13:46.459
but as you can see...
(chuckles) none of them

13:46.493 --> 13:49.829
can find the beat if it
was taped to their asses.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.965
-Can I just have a second?
-Ow!

13:51.999 --> 13:53.800
Damn it, you stepped

13:53.833 --> 13:56.036
-on my bunion, Carlito!
-MAYA: Carlito, again,

13:56.069 --> 13:58.138
it's your other left.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.340
Let's just... let's
just start from the top. Here.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.375
Yeah, start from the damn top.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.344
COOKIE:
Now, see that spot over there?

14:04.377 --> 14:06.379
The empty spot?
That's where your youngest son

14:06.413 --> 14:09.416
is supposed to be,
but he decided to be a no-show.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.717
(indistinct chatter)

14:10.750 --> 14:13.386
-Ugh. My fourth
pain in the ass is here.
-Ma.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.888
-I said no.
-"Loving You Is Easy"

14:14.922 --> 14:17.024
is a ten times better song
than this one.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.491
Yeah, it's smooth, it's sexy,

14:18.525 --> 14:20.393
but it's not a showstopper.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.195
Dad, can you please talk
to wifey, please?

14:22.229 --> 14:23.931
-Boy.
-Okay, my fiancé

14:23.964 --> 14:25.765
literally did a solid
for this family, and I'm

14:25.798 --> 14:28.568
just trying to sing a song
for him. Like, can I live?

14:28.601 --> 14:31.071
You could sing all the songs
to Kai you want to,

14:31.104 --> 14:34.041
after the showcase.

14:34.074 --> 14:38.211
-Jump in anytime, nubby.
-Wait, what do you
expect me to say?

14:38.245 --> 14:39.412
And "nubby"?

14:39.446 --> 14:41.114
COOKIE: Why don't you
get up there and talk

14:41.148 --> 14:43.083
that Shaka Zulu-meets-Malcolm X

14:43.116 --> 14:44.851
mumbo jumbo you be preachin'?

14:44.884 --> 14:47.554
LUCIOUS: Nah, I think you got
this one, baby. I'll be back.

14:47.587 --> 14:51.424
Bye. Listen here, listen here!

14:51.458 --> 14:53.760
(sighs):
All right, y'all...

14:53.793 --> 14:55.795
you're about to step
into the big time.

14:55.828 --> 15:00.367
Now you got to impress
the big check-signers.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.735
The re check-signers.

15:02.769 --> 15:05.939
Nike's gonna be in the house.
Apple. Live Nation.

15:05.973 --> 15:09.542
Look, you are performing
for your future.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.812
Okay? What you do
on that stage tomorrow night

15:12.845 --> 15:16.449
will define
the rest of your life.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.586
Yeah, well...
where's your man Hakeem at?

15:19.619 --> 15:22.622
Ain't he supposed to be
listening to this speech, too?

15:22.655 --> 15:24.624
You got commentary, Devon?

15:24.657 --> 15:28.128
-I'm just sayin'.
-See, that's what's wrong
with you celibates.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.829
You got all this pent-up energy.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.931
Why don't you put it
in your performance

15:31.965 --> 15:33.400
and make this count?

15:33.433 --> 15:34.801
How about that?

15:35.835 --> 15:38.405
Come on!
Get back to rehearsing!

15:38.438 --> 15:41.341
Here we go. From the top.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.476
And five, six, seven,

15:43.510 --> 15:44.877
-eight.
-(snaps fingers)

15:51.318 --> 15:52.485
What's up?

15:52.519 --> 15:53.786
Really don't think

15:53.820 --> 15:55.855
you should be here
right now, Hakeem.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.158
-I'm just here to talk to you.
-(sighs)

15:58.191 --> 16:00.493
Look, Tee, on my kids,

16:00.527 --> 16:01.995
Bella and Prince,

16:02.029 --> 16:04.531
I'm sorry
for what I put you through.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.370
I know you're sorry, Hakeem.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.172
Look, I am, too.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.208
But all this constant drama
and beefing and violence,

16:15.242 --> 16:17.710
I just can't anymore.

16:17.744 --> 16:20.180
Maybe we're not meant to be.
I don't know.

16:20.213 --> 16:23.016
Maybe we're just not good
for each other, you know?

16:24.251 --> 16:27.187
I know, but we got
to be there for our kids.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.156
Regardless, Tee.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.726
Well, look...

16:33.760 --> 16:36.829
we may not be good together...

16:36.863 --> 16:39.899
but we can be good
to each other.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.368
(sighs)

16:41.401 --> 16:43.970
Yeah. The kids deserve that.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.506
They deserve two parents
that's gonna be there for them.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.777
Let's be that.

16:56.283 --> 16:59.018
Look, I can't.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.124
I'm gonna get out of here.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.997
There's blood in the water, Pop.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.899
Empire is losing
strategic partnerships

17:12.932 --> 17:15.268
with two major tech firms,
and that's just the beginning.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.769
-No, no, no, no, no.
-(laughs)

17:16.803 --> 17:18.771
I got calls
from a bunch of people

17:18.805 --> 17:20.840
-(phone vibrating)
-that want to jump ship
from Empire

17:20.873 --> 17:24.544
and-and swim over to our
little bitty boat right now.

17:27.147 --> 17:30.083
-Oh, that's your girl?
-It's nothing, Pop.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.951
The one you
won't introduce me to

17:31.984 --> 17:34.287
that now you
ain't taking her calls.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.389
What, she ain't important
no more?

17:36.423 --> 17:38.258
She's important.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.194
You know, she's got a son.
He's a good kid, you know.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.629
They make me feel calm.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.398
I'm not seeing a problem.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.066
(sighs heavily)

17:47.100 --> 17:49.536
Pop, being with me
puts a target on the backs

17:49.569 --> 17:50.937
of anybody who gets too close.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.306
You know,
maybe I'm cursed, right?

17:53.340 --> 17:55.442
Teri and Quincy don't
deserve that, and, you know,

17:55.475 --> 17:57.110
I-I probably don't deserve them.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.579
You know? So...
And that's perfectly fine.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.649
I mean, have you
ever stopped to think...

18:02.682 --> 18:06.052
maybe you deserve
all of it, son?

18:06.085 --> 18:09.055
I mean, I've watched you spend
your whole life trying to...

18:09.088 --> 18:12.425
wrestle these demons
and put them in their place,

18:12.459 --> 18:13.893
and you've...

18:13.926 --> 18:17.063
been successful at times.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.665
But that just makes you
a survivor.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.267
It makes you like me, and...

18:20.300 --> 18:21.301
we're Lyons, man.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.635
Lyons don't just survive.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.238
We thrive where
everything else perishes.

18:25.272 --> 18:29.242
So if life is offering you
something good,

18:29.276 --> 18:30.643
take it, accept it.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.845
You deserve that, man.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.683
Enjoy it.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.155
* Man, I think ...
did it on purpose *

18:42.189 --> 18:44.191
* I'm-a hit him
in the face on purpose *

18:44.224 --> 18:46.493
* If I catch 25,
it was worth it *

18:46.526 --> 18:47.660
* It was worth it... *

18:47.694 --> 18:49.762
All right, watch this, man.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.664
I'm about to take
your money right now.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.833
* They give a ...
about a gun charge *

18:53.866 --> 18:55.468
* Catch 1-3 and do the service

18:55.502 --> 18:57.804
* ... round me
if you nervous *

18:57.837 --> 18:59.672
Check out homie
at the door, dawg.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.508
* I turned the roof
into a Lamb *

19:01.541 --> 19:02.975
I'm good.
I ain't strapped today.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.011
* I built a castle
from the sand *

19:05.044 --> 19:07.214
-(clears throat)
-* My homie might die in...

19:07.247 --> 19:08.848
You know...

19:08.881 --> 19:13.620
before, you said you look at my
kids like they were your family.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.822
I still do, man.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.158
Almost lost my little girl.

19:19.192 --> 19:22.462
* In the Lambo, hangin'
off the horse like Rambo... *

-Damn.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.634
I'm sorry that happened, bro.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.837
Look... I need you to know,

19:30.870 --> 19:33.340
nothing ever happened
with me and Tee, Keem.

19:33.373 --> 19:37.810
But I'm sorry I let
the diss track get out of hand.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.746
I don't know how
to make that right, but...

19:39.779 --> 19:42.749
whatever it is, I'll do it.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.956
("Silent Night" instrumental
continues)

TERI (laughs):
I mean,

19:57.797 --> 20:00.233
I know they're good,
but... four?

20:00.267 --> 20:01.368
Look...

20:01.401 --> 20:02.902
I'll save one for Andre.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.371
ANDRE:
Just one?

20:04.404 --> 20:06.105
-Ah.
-(chuckles)

20:06.138 --> 20:07.607
Ha-ha!

20:07.640 --> 20:09.709
Yo, man!

20:09.742 --> 20:12.078
-Whoo.
-Man.

20:12.111 --> 20:16.048
I'm gonna go and get some sodas.
You guys want anything?

20:16.082 --> 20:17.384
I'm good, baby.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.051
-Good?
-I'm good, man.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.087
-All right.
-All right.
And wipe your lip, brah.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.689
-Oh, thank you, man.
-(chuckles)

20:22.722 --> 20:24.624
Hi.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.296
(sighs)

20:43.443 --> 20:46.613
Last time I came here...

20:46.646 --> 20:49.416
was to say good-bye to my wife.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.784
*

20:51.818 --> 20:53.420
I thought that...

20:53.453 --> 20:56.723
being alone and in the dark
was what I was meant to be,

20:56.756 --> 20:58.458
it was...

20:58.491 --> 21:00.493
it's what I deserved.

21:00.527 --> 21:03.930
-Andre, you...
-And then you...

21:03.963 --> 21:06.666
came wandering in
with this light...

21:09.536 --> 21:12.104
...and I just want
to be near you.

21:15.642 --> 21:18.311
I want that, too.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.747
I'm a dangerous man, Teri.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.783
That's not what I see.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.457
What I need to know is,

21:30.490 --> 21:33.025
are you willing to take the risk
of being around me?

21:53.145 --> 21:57.316
Ugh. It feels more like
Santa's funeral in here,

21:57.350 --> 22:00.019
or the funeral of one
of his dumb little elves.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.822
One of his elves has nine lives,
and this isn't his last.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.190
Ms. Williams.

22:04.223 --> 22:07.026
-Come with us.
-What the hell's going on here?
-What?

22:07.059 --> 22:08.761
Kingsley showed me what you did.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.364
You've been working
with Lucious Lyon

22:11.398 --> 22:13.032
to take advantage
of our customers.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.200
What?

22:14.233 --> 22:15.735
I have the e-mail chain
right here that proves it.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.537
You set me up.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.506
What are you talk-- Give me--
What are you talking about?

22:19.539 --> 22:20.873
-What e-mails?
-Your things have
been collected.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.376
-These men will show you out.
-My things?

22:23.410 --> 22:26.413
-Come on.
-You could-- No, okay, f--
He's a liar.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.381
-Ma'am...
-He is a liar! Y'all gonna

22:28.415 --> 22:31.518
-get off of me!
Hey, he's a liar!
-Jeff...

22:31.551 --> 22:32.719
Somebody call my mom!

22:32.752 --> 22:33.820
-Becky.
-What you need to do

22:33.853 --> 22:36.489
-is stop manhandling! No, no!
-Ma'am.

22:36.523 --> 22:37.657
Get out.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.226
What is going on?
Let me see that.

22:40.259 --> 22:42.962
Sink or swim.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.405
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no!

22:52.439 --> 22:55.074
Pull it back just a little bit
so it stay in line.

22:55.107 --> 22:58.077
-Lucious, we got to talk, man.
-Hey, man, I got two hours

22:58.110 --> 23:00.279
-before this showcase.
-My man, my man. We got to talk.

23:02.415 --> 23:03.750
What is it?

23:03.783 --> 23:04.951
I just heard
through the Thirstvine,

23:04.984 --> 23:06.252
Becky got bum-rushed
out of Empire.

23:06.285 --> 23:08.421
Walked her right out
the front door.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.857
You think Kingsley knows
she's been working for me?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.559
No, no, Becky knows
how to cover her back,

23:12.592 --> 23:14.393
and the keylogger I gave her
is untraceable.

23:14.427 --> 23:16.429
Come on, you know she's not
the real target here.

23:16.463 --> 23:20.567
-Yeah, he knows we go way back.
-Exactly.

23:20.600 --> 23:24.270
So he's gonna try and pin
this whole data mining on her

23:24.303 --> 23:26.238
-and say it was for me.
-Okay, now, look.

23:26.272 --> 23:27.974
I will take care
of the Becky situation.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.108
That's on me, all right?

23:29.141 --> 23:30.443
I just got to make sure
you don't do anything

23:30.477 --> 23:32.479
-to jeopardize this showcase.
-Showcase?

23:32.512 --> 23:34.581
To hell with the showcase!
This is my reputation.

23:34.614 --> 23:37.316
I've never dropped a dime
on anybody my whole damn life!

23:37.349 --> 23:39.418
Nobody's talking about you...
It's not about dropping dimes,

23:39.452 --> 23:42.121
it's about taking care
of business, man.

23:42.154 --> 23:44.090
I've been trying you all day,
Mal. What's up?

23:44.123 --> 23:47.059
-Hold on, give me a second.
-All right.

23:47.093 --> 23:51.498
Babe, I'm sorry. It's been crazy
with this, all this.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.833
How you doing?

23:53.866 --> 23:56.302
-I'm sorry.
-Uh...

23:56.335 --> 23:59.972
I got a call from a new source
who saw my Empire story.

24:00.006 --> 24:04.477
He had a lot of new info
about your dad.

24:04.511 --> 24:05.745
What'd he say?

24:05.778 --> 24:06.846
Well, when Lucious was in charge

24:06.879 --> 24:09.315
of Empire, he kept a dossier
on all of his artists,

24:09.348 --> 24:10.950
and every single one
of those names

24:10.983 --> 24:12.418
had been mixed up
in some kind of drama.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.321
Domestic abuse, assaults,
drug trafficking.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.924
-You know, the kind of drama
that kills careers.
-Yeah.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.527
And your dad buried it all.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.432
I mean, I know
that sounds awful now,

24:26.465 --> 24:29.936
but back then, obviously, he was
just protecting his artists.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.204
Yeah, but, Jamal,
what about the victims?

24:32.238 --> 24:34.340
Who-who has their back, or...

24:34.373 --> 24:36.342
What, it's okay that
we just bury this all?

24:36.375 --> 24:38.277
Well, wait, I mean, if you...

24:38.310 --> 24:42.014
if you look deeper in that
dossier, you'll see my name

24:42.048 --> 24:43.883
next to "a drug addict."

24:43.916 --> 24:45.652
Nobody knows what really
went down with that

24:45.685 --> 24:46.919
except me and my family.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.221
Just like you don't know what
really happened to those artists

24:49.255 --> 24:52.825
or my dad or whatever they did.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.393
The point is is that my family

24:54.426 --> 24:55.995
certainly don't need
the noise right now,

24:56.028 --> 24:57.564
so it's not like you can run it.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.732
Okay, so you're asking me
to choose between what's right

24:59.766 --> 25:00.967
and what's right
for your family?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.935
You are my family, babe.

25:05.538 --> 25:09.408
Mal, you know what...

25:09.441 --> 25:13.412
you know what half-truths
and partial-truths can do.

25:13.445 --> 25:16.115
I'm a victim of a partial-truth,
you know that.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.855
-Truth conquers all, Jamal.
-Babe, it's not the same.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.023
No, baby, listen to me.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.892
-It's not the same.
-Jamal, listen to me.

25:25.925 --> 25:29.495
I know myself,

25:29.528 --> 25:32.599
and if I don't
release this story,

25:32.632 --> 25:35.234
I'm gonna end up resenting you
for asking me to kill it.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.570
Oh, my God.
I'm so sick of people

25:37.604 --> 25:39.972
trying to make me choose
between my fam...

25:44.110 --> 25:47.246
It's not the same. It's not.

25:49.115 --> 25:52.518
Baby, give me the dossier.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.486
You know I'm-a do
the right thing.

25:56.555 --> 26:01.093
I'm gonna hold off
on the story for now, but, uh...

26:01.127 --> 26:05.464
I think I need time to think
about our story.

26:05.497 --> 26:07.566
Is that a joke?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.969
No.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.771
What exactly does that mean?

26:11.804 --> 26:16.275
My producers want to talk about
giving me a permanent slot,

26:16.308 --> 26:19.278
-in London.
-In London?

26:19.311 --> 26:21.580
And I'm gonna go over there
and talk to them.

26:21.614 --> 26:24.751
That's amazing.

26:24.784 --> 26:28.087
I still don't know
what-what this is about.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.421
Is this you leaving me?

26:29.455 --> 26:31.557
Look, I just need a--
I need a break,

26:31.590 --> 26:35.061
or-or a new perspective,
or-or just something.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.030
I think we both do.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.500
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoo

26:41.533 --> 26:43.069
* Zone, zone, zone,
zone, zone, zone *

26:43.102 --> 26:44.804
* Where the love go?

26:44.837 --> 26:48.240
So, no one's seen Lucious,
right? (chuckles)

26:48.274 --> 26:49.976
Oh, no. You want me to call him?

26:50.009 --> 26:52.011
What you think
I've been doing, Porsha?

26:52.044 --> 26:55.982
Here. I can't wait
for his ass no more.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.817
The show must go on, honey.

26:57.850 --> 26:58.951
* The night is young though

26:58.985 --> 27:00.019
* The diamonds still shine

27:00.052 --> 27:01.954
* In the rough, ho

27:01.988 --> 27:03.355
* Where the love go?

27:03.389 --> 27:04.791
* Five, four, three, two...

27:04.824 --> 27:07.459
-(cheering)
-Yes!

27:07.493 --> 27:09.361
I love you!

27:09.395 --> 27:10.997
Whoo!

27:11.030 --> 27:15.001
Tonight marks
a new era in music.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.703
-(cheering)
-Yes.

27:16.736 --> 27:21.140
And that new era is defined
by a new wave of talent.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.609
(cheering)

27:23.642 --> 27:26.612
A new talent and a new way
to find that talent

27:26.645 --> 27:29.648
and nurture it
and bring it to the public.

27:29.682 --> 27:32.618
(cheering)

27:32.651 --> 27:36.488
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are the Lyons.

27:36.522 --> 27:38.624
(cheering)

27:38.657 --> 27:43.696
And tonight, we are proud
to introduce to you our family.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.664
(cheering)

27:48.034 --> 27:49.836
*

27:49.869 --> 27:51.070
* Ooh, yeah

27:51.103 --> 27:52.839
* Empire

27:52.872 --> 27:54.406
* Ooh, yeah

27:55.407 --> 27:58.044
* Ooh, yeah

27:58.077 --> 28:00.012
* Yeah

28:00.046 --> 28:02.081
* My life flashes

28:02.114 --> 28:03.649
* Ahead is my desertion

28:03.682 --> 28:06.853
* His trigger finger makes me
contemplate if I deserve it *

28:06.886 --> 28:09.321
* I'd be damned if my family
would take the hit *

28:09.355 --> 28:10.556
* So be a man

28:10.589 --> 28:12.558
* And step in front
of this angry man *

28:12.591 --> 28:13.726
-* Without a purpose, yeah
-* Let's go *

28:13.760 --> 28:15.161
* Tell me
this ain't a conclusion *

28:15.194 --> 28:16.395
* My body can barely react

28:16.428 --> 28:18.430
* I'm thinking
it's just an illusion *

28:18.464 --> 28:19.866
* But the bullet
is telling me facts *

28:19.899 --> 28:21.667
* 'Cause that's my girl,
and that's my kid *

28:21.700 --> 28:23.202
* If they ain't breathing,
I ain't living *

28:23.235 --> 28:25.204
* Can't express the feeling,
praying *

28:25.237 --> 28:26.405
* Give me one more minute,
yeah *

28:26.438 --> 28:29.575
* Lost all control
in the blink of an eye *

28:29.608 --> 28:32.611
* Just a single thought
went across my mind *

28:32.644 --> 28:34.580
* I'm asking, I'm begging

28:34.613 --> 28:36.783
* I'm pleading
just for one more minute *

28:36.816 --> 28:38.751
-* One more minute
-* What you say? Yeah *

28:38.785 --> 28:41.954
* Eyes opened up,
no, it's not my time *

28:41.988 --> 28:45.691
* Need to make a choice,
am I willing to fight? *

28:45.724 --> 28:47.359
* I'm asking, I'm begging

28:47.393 --> 28:48.961
* I'm pleading
just for one more minute *

28:48.995 --> 28:50.596
-* One more minute *
-* One more minute

28:50.629 --> 28:51.798
* Just one more minute, yeah *

28:51.831 --> 28:52.631
* Just take me back

28:52.664 --> 28:54.633
* So I can think
for 60 seconds *

28:54.666 --> 28:56.803
* Back when I seen
inside Tiana's eyes *

28:56.836 --> 28:57.904
-* She needs protection
-* Protection *

28:57.937 --> 28:59.405
* Just take me back when
I was rapping *

28:59.438 --> 29:00.539
* I could see perfection

29:00.572 --> 29:02.274
* Take these fragments
out my lungs *

29:02.308 --> 29:04.043
* So I can breathe
for 60 seconds *

29:04.076 --> 29:05.444
* Pardon me, I don't get this

29:05.477 --> 29:07.446
* Yeah, I get
that I'm not sinless *

29:07.479 --> 29:08.948
* I ain't perfect,
and I understand *

29:08.981 --> 29:11.117
* I could live life so
senseless, I don't get this *

29:11.150 --> 29:12.184
* I don't get this

29:12.218 --> 29:13.619
* I mean, what's
a prince without a princess? *

29:13.652 --> 29:16.122
* What's a prince
without a princess? *

29:16.155 --> 29:17.289
* It's worthless

29:17.323 --> 29:20.893
* Lost all control
in the blink of an eye *

29:20.927 --> 29:24.496
* Just a single thought
went across my mind *

29:24.530 --> 29:25.664
* I'm asking, I'm begging,
I'm pleading *

29:25.697 --> 29:27.834
* Just for one more minute

29:27.867 --> 29:29.768
-* One more more minute
-* What you say? Yeah *

29:29.802 --> 29:32.738
* Eyes opened up,
no, it's not my time *

29:32.771 --> 29:36.108
* Need to make a choice,
am I willing to fight? *

29:36.142 --> 29:37.643
* I'm asking...

29:37.676 --> 29:39.578
Kingsley,
you know good and damn well

29:39.611 --> 29:41.513
Becky had nothing to do
with any of that.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.149
Giselle, I've seen the e-mails,
and you're in there, too.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.151
-What the hell is your problem?
-I saw some stuff in there...

29:45.184 --> 29:46.285
You're gonna try and turn me

29:46.318 --> 29:48.254
-into some snitch?
-Oh, my God!

29:48.287 --> 29:49.321
-I never snitch!
-Lucious, stop it!

29:49.355 --> 29:51.323
Oh, my God, stop.
You're gonna kill him!

29:51.357 --> 29:53.860
Lucious, please, don't do this!
He's your son.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.494
He's your son!

29:55.527 --> 29:58.030
Lucious, he's your son.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.999
What are you talking about?

30:00.032 --> 30:01.467
(groans)

30:01.500 --> 30:03.669
GISELLE:
It's true.

30:03.702 --> 30:07.439
His mother's in Lakewood now,
the rehab place.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.875
You know her as White Tracy.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.680
That's not possible.

30:14.713 --> 30:18.517
You want to hit me again... Dad?

30:25.257 --> 30:27.759
(monitor beeping steadily)

30:50.016 --> 30:52.919
("It's Like That"
by Run-D.M.C. playing)

30:52.952 --> 30:55.988
* Don't ask me,
because I don't know why *

30:56.022 --> 30:58.224
* But it's like that,
and that's the way it is *

30:58.257 --> 31:01.560
Look, you might want
to slow your roll, all right?

31:01.593 --> 31:02.895
* People in the world
tryin' to make ends meet *

31:02.929 --> 31:06.899
I know what I'm doing, Lucious.
We hanging out later?

31:06.933 --> 31:08.567
Maybe.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.402
I don't know yet.

31:10.436 --> 31:11.570
* You want to compete

31:11.603 --> 31:14.406
I'll catch you later.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.909
* And that's the way it is

31:16.943 --> 31:18.110
* Huh

31:18.144 --> 31:19.545
What's up, Shine?

31:19.578 --> 31:21.213
-What's good, bro?
-Chilling, man.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.448
So, now you're hitting
White Tracy.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.083
You trying to hit all the girls?

31:24.116 --> 31:25.451
Shut up, Shine.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.086
I'm just saying, man.

31:27.119 --> 31:30.256
You need to get you one girl.
Lay off these chicks, cuz.

31:30.289 --> 31:34.193
Well, I ain't found
that one yet, so that's a no.

31:34.226 --> 31:37.629
-(scoffs)
-Let's roll.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.004
(Lucious sighs)

31:46.973 --> 31:48.941
Lucious.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.742
(Tracy gasps)

31:50.776 --> 31:52.979
Hey, Tracy.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.082
It's been a long time.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.084
(Tracy sighs)

31:58.117 --> 32:01.120
I knew you'd come back, Lucious.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.289
Come back? Uh...

32:03.322 --> 32:05.591
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.894
I mean, you know,
you and me, back in the day,

32:08.927 --> 32:12.464
we hung out a few times,
but that was it.

32:12.498 --> 32:15.634
Doesn't take more than that.

32:15.667 --> 32:19.471
Look, I don't know what your
condition is, but there's no...

32:19.505 --> 32:21.240
Look at him.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.842
Please just look at him.

32:25.477 --> 32:28.114
You can take a DNA test
if you want.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.182
Just... look

32:30.216 --> 32:32.351
in my baby's eyes.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.364
Tell me he's not your son.

32:49.535 --> 32:52.738
*

32:54.040 --> 32:56.142
All right, go break a leg.
What happened to you?

32:56.175 --> 32:58.477
-Did you fall
into a damn toilet?
-Look, baby,

32:58.510 --> 33:00.679
-I really need to talk.
-I can't talk to you
right now, Lucious.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.481
You know what I'm up against.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.516
You didn't even have
the common decency

33:04.550 --> 33:06.685
to call me back,
return my texts, nothing.

33:06.718 --> 33:08.287
-I need to talk to you.
-Well, you will

33:08.320 --> 33:12.024
talk to me at home
because the show is almost over.

33:12.058 --> 33:14.193
* Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh *

33:14.226 --> 33:17.363
-(cheering)
-HAKEEM: You know who it is.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.798
* Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh *

33:19.831 --> 33:21.333
HAKEEM:
The young prince.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.835
* Ooh, oh, ooh-ooh *

33:23.869 --> 33:27.173
* Okay, crown got my name on it,
bow to the Royal Prince *

33:27.206 --> 33:30.842
* Started in the game and
right now I'm gonna finish it *

33:30.876 --> 33:33.879
* Down but not limited,
pain is my benefit *

33:33.912 --> 33:36.548
* When you take a Lyon out the
jungle this is what you get *

33:36.582 --> 33:40.719
-* You get *
-* You're trying to ride
with the mob, yeah *

33:40.752 --> 33:43.689
* Boy, you better get up
on your job, yeah *

33:43.722 --> 33:46.192
* All that cappin' got to do it
from the side, yeah *

33:46.225 --> 33:49.061
* Make sure you don't cross
the line when I slide, yeah *

33:49.095 --> 33:51.897
* I've been bent,
but I'm unbroken *

33:51.930 --> 33:55.101
* I got some regrets,
but I know where I'm going *

33:55.134 --> 33:58.104
* 'Cause in the end,
it's never the end *

33:58.137 --> 33:59.738
(in harmony):
* You know I'll get up

33:59.771 --> 34:02.774
* And still come back for more

34:02.808 --> 34:06.745
* I, I, I put it on the line

34:06.778 --> 34:08.614
* Every dollar,
every dime, why not *

34:08.647 --> 34:12.584
* I, I, I made it
through the fire *

34:12.618 --> 34:14.253
* Came out on the other side

34:14.286 --> 34:17.089
* Shout-out to my enemies,
know this ain't the end of me *

34:17.123 --> 34:20.226
* Keep that same energy,
wonder why I'm winning *

34:20.259 --> 34:23.362
* Aye-aye, aye-aye, aye-aye,
why not *

34:23.395 --> 34:27.099
-* Aye-aye, aye-aye, aye-aye
-* Why not, ooh, ooh, ooh *

34:27.133 --> 34:30.436
-* Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh *
-* Yeah

34:30.469 --> 34:31.970
* Stop it,
no, you can't stop it *

34:32.003 --> 34:34.773
-* Somos los padres...
-Look at this.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.942
The curtain's not even closed
yet, and we already

34:36.975 --> 34:38.777
got sponsorship deals
on the table

34:38.810 --> 34:43.215
from Nike,
Live Nation and Apple.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.151
How much are they talking?

34:45.184 --> 34:48.920
$30 to $40 million.
I love you, Lucious.

34:48.954 --> 34:51.790
* We be putting in the work and
now we're running the show *

34:51.823 --> 34:55.127
(in harmony): * And when
we move, there ain't nothing *

34:55.161 --> 34:56.562
* We can't do

34:56.595 --> 34:58.997
* And y'all can't break us

34:59.030 --> 35:01.467
* Shout-out to my enemies, know
this ain't the end of me... *

35:01.500 --> 35:03.235
What are you doing here?

35:03.269 --> 35:05.070
I have something to tell you
about Jeff Kingsley.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.806
COOKIE: Everything I need
to know about Jeff Kingsley

35:07.839 --> 35:09.475
can fit on one finger.
Guess which one.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.811
I agree with you, Cookie.
I don't believe the accusations

35:12.844 --> 35:14.780
he made against you
and Becky, Lucious.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.582
You came all the way down here
to tell us that?

35:16.615 --> 35:19.685
What if I told you I could have
him out of Empire for good,

35:19.718 --> 35:21.853
and get you back
running the company you built?

35:21.887 --> 35:24.690
Yes, because
while all this is cute,

35:24.723 --> 35:27.092
I'm offering you the throne.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.661
* Out of the ashes,
the star in the making... *

35:29.695 --> 35:31.363
With me as co-partner.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.799
Oh... (scoffs)

35:33.832 --> 35:35.867
You might want
to think about it.

35:35.901 --> 35:37.869
We'll think about it.

35:37.903 --> 35:41.207
* Options, no hay no options

35:41.240 --> 35:43.309
-* We got to pop this.
-(cheering)

35:48.314 --> 35:50.482
Man, that was a crazy-ass plan
that Giselle had,

35:50.516 --> 35:52.851
but it just might work.

35:52.884 --> 35:56.154
Yeah, the question is,
do we want it to work?

35:56.188 --> 35:57.823
Oh.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.459
Look, we just built something
mean and lean

36:00.492 --> 36:03.629
that can withstand any new
challenge in the music biz.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.865
Yeah, or do we go back
and reclaim

36:06.898 --> 36:11.403
what we spent 20 years
of our lives sacrificing for?

36:11.437 --> 36:13.472
(Cookie sighs heavily)

36:13.505 --> 36:16.908
So we got to choose between
our future and our foundation?

36:19.278 --> 36:21.647
Says who?

36:21.680 --> 36:23.982
Aren't you the same
one-legged wise man

36:24.015 --> 36:26.885
I heard tell his son
he can have it all?

36:26.918 --> 36:28.854
Well, why can't we?
Why can't we have it all?

36:28.887 --> 36:30.856
Why can't we be the label

36:30.889 --> 36:33.058
and the management company
to our artists?

36:33.091 --> 36:34.593
We don't have the bandwidth,
baby.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.161
Well, we can raise it.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.598
With the money we rake in
tonight and...

36:43.602 --> 36:45.771
...from this.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.707
What's this?

36:48.740 --> 36:50.442
(groans softly)

36:50.476 --> 36:53.211
-You okay?
-Yeah.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.784
That's...

36:58.817 --> 37:01.353
$5 million.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.555
You sold the condo?

37:03.589 --> 37:05.391
(chuckles)

37:07.893 --> 37:10.061
Did you make up
with your sister?

37:10.095 --> 37:12.598
Oh, I didn't need
to talk to my big-mouth sister

37:12.631 --> 37:14.400
to sell that condo.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.435
Look, Lucious...

37:16.468 --> 37:18.904
I'm all in with you.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.440
Every step, every penny.

37:21.473 --> 37:23.108
I don't know what to say.

37:23.141 --> 37:25.110
Say we deserve it.
(laughs)

37:25.143 --> 37:27.212
You know what?

37:27.245 --> 37:29.648
Look.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.650
There's something
I got to tell you.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.552
-What?
-Now...
-PORSHA: You guys,

37:33.585 --> 37:35.487
the song is over.
You two are up.

37:35.521 --> 37:38.156
Okay, look, talk to me
when we get home, Lucious.

37:38.189 --> 37:40.225
Come on,
let's go get what's ours.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.160
(cheering)

37:47.999 --> 37:51.136
(cheering and applause)

37:51.169 --> 37:53.872
Thank you!

37:55.841 --> 37:57.809
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

37:57.843 --> 38:00.111
Thank you. Thank you so much

38:00.145 --> 38:02.514
for making tonight
such a resounding success

38:02.548 --> 38:05.183
for the LFM family

38:05.216 --> 38:07.953
and our artists. You know what?
As a matter of fact,

38:07.986 --> 38:11.457
I'm gonna bring up the "LF"
in the LFM-- our boys!

38:11.490 --> 38:12.858
Come on up here!

38:12.891 --> 38:14.660
You, too, Andre. Get up here.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.161
Whoo!

38:16.194 --> 38:18.830
Yes, my handsome babies.
That's right.

38:18.864 --> 38:21.266
(cheering)

38:21.299 --> 38:26.004
These three are why
we do what we do.

38:26.037 --> 38:28.173
And I'm telling you,
ladies and gentlemen,

38:28.206 --> 38:30.609
tonight is only the beginning.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.511
-(cheering)
-Soon,

38:32.544 --> 38:36.782
our family will have some news
to share with you,

38:36.815 --> 38:41.453
and that news is going to take
the Lyon name to higher heights.

38:41.487 --> 38:43.054
You have to consider...

38:43.088 --> 38:44.523
Does that include every Lyon?

38:44.556 --> 38:47.158
What?

38:48.394 --> 38:49.795
Is that Kingsley?

38:49.828 --> 38:52.197
(audience murmuring)

38:53.599 --> 38:55.634
(singsongy):
Lucious,

38:55.667 --> 38:57.235
do you want to tell them
or should I?

38:57.268 --> 39:00.038
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't... don't answer.

39:00.071 --> 39:03.308
Since a flare for the dramatic

39:03.341 --> 39:07.379
seems to run in this family,
allow me the honors...

39:07.413 --> 39:09.548
Dad.

39:09.581 --> 39:12.684
(Kingsley chuckles)

39:12.718 --> 39:14.853
Yeah, you heard it here first.

39:14.886 --> 39:18.356
Lucious Lyon is...

39:18.390 --> 39:20.559
-my father.
-(audience gasping)

39:20.592 --> 39:24.396
You've all heard the story about
when Cookie met Lucious, right?

39:24.430 --> 39:27.265
But have you heard the one
where Lucious met my mother,

39:27.298 --> 39:29.034
got her knocked up,
hooked on crack,

39:29.067 --> 39:32.270
and then left her to have me
and raise me on her own?

39:32.303 --> 39:35.941
Bet you didn't.

39:35.974 --> 39:38.444
-He's lying, Pop.
-No. Stop, son.
-No.

39:53.925 --> 39:57.128
You're gonna be Mommy's
little man today, okay?

39:57.162 --> 40:01.399
Today's the day
you're gonna meet your daddy.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.505
Go on.

40:08.139 --> 40:10.809
Jamal, give me the car.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.782
LUCIOUS:
Who is it?

40:16.815 --> 40:18.784
Hey.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.652
Tracy? What are you doing here?

40:20.686 --> 40:22.053
I don't sling out of my house.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.823
Uh, no. Yeah, I know.
I-I figured. I mean,

40:24.856 --> 40:26.792
you know, you were going places.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.794
No, I've been to rehab.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.596
Then with my grandparents.

40:30.629 --> 40:31.930
Good for you.

40:31.963 --> 40:33.565
Um, look, like I said,
I don't,

40:33.599 --> 40:34.933
I don't sling out of my house.

40:34.966 --> 40:37.235
What-what do you need?

40:37.268 --> 40:40.972
Um, Jeffrey-- this is my son.

40:41.006 --> 40:43.174
Jeffrey, honey, come on.

40:46.612 --> 40:49.314
Come and say hi to...
Lucious Lyon.

40:49.347 --> 40:53.284
Good-looking kid.
Hey, man, how you doing?

40:53.318 --> 40:55.987
Like I said, that's not
what I do from here.

40:56.021 --> 40:57.422
Look, if you need something,

40:57.455 --> 40:59.591
Bunkie's still
a couple blocks away.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.960
He'll take care of you,
you know. Just...

41:01.993 --> 41:03.161
Just give him this
and tell him...

41:03.194 --> 41:04.663
tell him
it's for old time's sake.

41:04.696 --> 41:06.998
-And I'll look after... Hey.
-COOKIE: Lucious, who is it?

41:07.032 --> 41:09.635
No, baby. Cook...
Now I got to go.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.336
Ain't nobody.

41:11.369 --> 41:12.971
Don't come here.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.340
-Lucious?
-(door slams)

41:17.408 --> 41:19.010
Okay. Hey.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.548
Let's go.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.532
That was the last day
I saw my mother sober, Lucious.

41:40.566 --> 41:42.467
So while your other kids

41:42.500 --> 41:46.237
were playing
with their little Tonka trucks,

41:46.271 --> 41:48.206
I was left to be
my mom's dirty little secret.

41:48.239 --> 41:50.375
Dad, this can't be true.

41:51.543 --> 41:54.546
I've spent my whole life

41:54.580 --> 41:56.481
trying not to hate you.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.550
Dad, you need to say something.
You need to say something now.

41:58.584 --> 42:00.986
You better tell me
this is not true, Lucious.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.854
And I was jealous of you three.

42:02.888 --> 42:07.726
But today I got a taste
of what it is to be a Lyon son.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.494
Got my face beat in by Lucious,

42:09.527 --> 42:12.664
and then I found my mother
lying on the floor,

42:12.698 --> 42:14.933
screaming his name after he
paid her a little visit today,

42:14.966 --> 42:16.367
and then left her again.

42:16.401 --> 42:19.037
Good news is
I'm not jealous anymore,

42:19.070 --> 42:21.106
because I wasn't raised
by that man,

42:21.139 --> 42:24.943
and that makes me the lucky one.

42:28.079 --> 42:31.449
So, what, you're gonna leave?

42:34.552 --> 42:36.421
Move!

42:36.454 --> 42:38.523
KINGSLEY: Oh, here comes
one of the three blind mice.

42:38.556 --> 42:41.026
-You gonna hit me, too?
-Nah.

42:41.059 --> 42:42.994
I'm gonna end you.

42:44.963 --> 42:47.633
Unless I end you first,
baby bro.

42:49.835 --> 42:52.270
Bring it.

42:54.439 --> 42:56.474

43:00.245 --> 43:01.579
-Doctor, please, please.
-There's no pulse.

43:01.613 --> 43:03.782
-Start compressions now.
-You got to save him!

43:03.815 --> 43:05.784
-There's no pulse.
Start compressions.
-No, no. Doctor.

43:05.817 --> 43:06.918
Doctor, no, you got to save him.

43:06.952 --> 43:07.786
Somebody get her
out of here, please.

43:07.819 --> 43:08.954
You got to save him! Please!

43:08.987 --> 43:09.955
-Clear.
-Look at me.

43:09.988 --> 43:10.989
Get your hands off of me!

43:11.022 --> 43:12.157
-Come on. Come on, baby.
-No. No, please!

43:12.190 --> 43:13.458
-We got to go. We got to go.
-Not my baby!

43:13.491 --> 43:15.894
-Let them do what they...
-No, no, no, no!

43:15.927 --> 43:17.796
-Get off me, Lucious!
-Clear.

43:17.829 --> 43:20.398
-No! Please! Not my baby!
-There's no pulse.
Start compressions.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.567
-No, Andre! Andre, no!
-Clear.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.603
-(monitor flatlining)
-No, Andre, please!

Now that Empire
has you all fired up,

44:11.516 --> 44:13.819
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:15.921 --> 44:17.155
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.827
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:21.860 --> 44:25.396

shooting star *

not forever *

MAN: Touchdown!

44:30.068 --> 44:33.638
