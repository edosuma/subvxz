WEBVTT

00:00.428 --> 00:02.081
Only on Fox.

00:09.263 --> 00:12.701
Okay, boys,
this one's for Jerry.

00:12.744 --> 00:14.355
May he rest in peace.

00:14.398 --> 00:17.836
One for me, one for you,
and one for you.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.361
D-Do not peer pressure me.
I haven't taken my pills yet.

00:20.404 --> 00:22.014
Do you know what happens
when you mix

00:22.058 --> 00:23.842
prescription drugs and alcohol?

00:23.886 --> 00:25.496
Yeah, a good time.

00:25.540 --> 00:30.022
I wouldn't do it.
I once mixed six tabs of acid

00:30.066 --> 00:31.589
with some New England
hard cider.

00:31.633 --> 00:33.591
Long story short,

00:33.635 --> 00:36.812
I can't eat apples
with my clothes on anymore.

00:36.855 --> 00:39.728
Let's raise a glass.
[clears throat]

00:39.771 --> 00:42.165
Jerry, what can I say?

00:42.209 --> 00:44.602
You were the most ornery,
foul-mouthed,

00:44.646 --> 00:50.260
mentally deranged son of a bitch
I ever met, and thank God I did.

00:50.304 --> 00:52.175
-We're gonna miss you, old pal.
-Yeah, we are.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.482
-To Jerry.
-To Jerry.
-To Jerry!

00:56.310 --> 00:58.486
[all exhaling]

00:58.529 --> 01:01.837
So, should we talk replacements?

01:01.880 --> 01:03.404
Have you lost your mind?

01:03.447 --> 01:06.276
Well, it is a prime seat.
We got to move fast.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.540
Now, look, guys, you know
we can never replace Jerry.

01:09.584 --> 01:10.976
The man was a legend.

01:11.020 --> 01:12.630
So I say we honor his legacy

01:12.674 --> 01:15.242
the way it should be honored,
with an empty seat.

01:17.896 --> 01:19.333
Do you mind?

01:19.376 --> 01:22.423
It has been a bitch
of a morning.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.991
Uh, hey, baby, you must be lost.

01:26.035 --> 01:28.124
Don't start, flyboy.

01:28.167 --> 01:31.301
I'm not in the mood
and I am not interested.

01:33.477 --> 01:35.218
Look, lady, I don't know
who you are,

01:35.262 --> 01:37.394
but you can't sit there.

01:37.438 --> 01:40.354
Why not? Who are you guys,
the cool kids?

01:40.397 --> 01:42.225
Damn straight we are.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.662
[laughing]:
You...

01:44.706 --> 01:45.576
Really?

01:46.838 --> 01:49.014
Him? Wow.

01:50.929 --> 01:52.453
I don't know
where you came from,

01:52.496 --> 01:54.455
but you can't sit
wherever you want.

01:54.498 --> 01:55.586
You got to be invited.

01:55.630 --> 01:57.501
He's right. You have
to earn that spot.

01:57.545 --> 01:59.982
Fine. I'll arm wrestle
you for it.

02:00.025 --> 02:03.942
-Fine.
-Wait, wait, S-Sid. Ooh.

02:06.380 --> 02:09.774
Did better than I thought.
[chuckles]

02:09.818 --> 02:11.689
Look, you gots to go.

02:11.733 --> 02:13.387
That seat belongs to Jerry.

02:13.430 --> 02:16.564
Is that right?
Where is this Jerry?

02:16.607 --> 02:18.479
ALLISON [over speaker]:
Good morning, Shady Meadows.

02:18.522 --> 02:21.351
I'm sorry to announce
that Jerry Walsh

02:21.395 --> 02:22.700
passed away yesterday.

02:22.744 --> 02:24.485
There'll be free balloons
and a cheese plate

02:24.528 --> 02:27.270
available in his memory.
Have a nice day.

02:28.663 --> 02:30.621
Jerry?

02:30.665 --> 02:32.580
What is your problem?

02:32.623 --> 02:34.277
Why you want to sit
at our table so bad, anyway?

02:34.321 --> 02:35.365
You know, honestly, I don't,

02:35.409 --> 02:37.454
but then you told me
that I couldn't.

02:37.498 --> 02:40.283
So now you are gonna need
a hearse to drag me out of here

02:40.327 --> 02:44.418
because nobody tells me
what to do. Nobody.

02:45.636 --> 02:47.986
You want me
to arm-wrestle her again?

02:48.030 --> 02:50.337
I think I'm getting
a second wind.

02:53.557 --> 02:55.603
â™ª

03:15.666 --> 03:18.452
That woman is violent.

03:18.495 --> 03:21.237
I think she broke my elbow.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.500
Times sure have changed.

03:23.544 --> 03:25.241
I mean, in the '50s,
a woman wouldn't dare

03:25.284 --> 03:26.764
just come sit at our table
like that.

03:26.808 --> 03:30.115
In the '50s, you wouldn't have
been allowed in the restaurant.

03:31.726 --> 03:33.554
I'd have been allowed in,
but I'd have had

03:33.597 --> 03:35.469
[deep voice]:
to talk like this.

03:37.906 --> 03:39.777
Plus, she disrespected Jerry.

03:39.821 --> 03:41.213
And speaking of Jerry,

03:41.257 --> 03:42.824
we need to talk
about his memorial service.

03:42.867 --> 03:45.522
Why do we have to talk about it?
Aren't they gonna give him one?

03:45.566 --> 03:48.656
A cheese plate and balloons
is not a service.

03:48.699 --> 03:50.353
-Jerry liked to party.
-Yeah.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.137
He would want something epic.

03:52.181 --> 03:55.489
You know, like kegs and a DJ,
fireworks,

03:55.532 --> 03:58.622
people getting butt naked
up in here.

03:58.666 --> 04:02.147
We need to throw something
like a Burning Man.

04:02.191 --> 04:04.019
You want to burn a man?

04:04.062 --> 04:06.151
No, it's a sex festival
in the desert.

04:06.195 --> 04:07.501
I go every year.

04:07.544 --> 04:12.549
Well, Allison is not gonna
let you throw a party.

04:12.593 --> 04:15.291
She runs this place
like Alcatraz.

04:15.334 --> 04:17.815
Don't worry about Allison.
We gonna go around her.

04:17.859 --> 04:20.514
Yeah, but a party like that's
gonna cost a lot of dough.

04:20.557 --> 04:24.605
Money? Oh, that's not
gonna be a problem.

04:24.648 --> 04:26.824
Well, why? You came
into some scratch?

04:26.868 --> 04:30.349
Well... I got this. [laughs]

04:30.393 --> 04:33.483
Is that Jerry's credit card?

04:33.527 --> 04:35.616
How the hell did you get
Jerry's credit card?

04:35.659 --> 04:37.531
Well, how does
anything happen, Hank?

04:37.574 --> 04:39.707
You're not the only one
with good ideas.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.627
Why is this still loose?

04:49.238 --> 04:51.501
Hey, do you know
where the supply closet is?

04:51.545 --> 04:54.765
No, nuh-uh.
Do you know how to fix a table?

04:54.809 --> 04:56.724
Psst! Come on, over here.

04:57.812 --> 04:59.770
Hurry up, man, come on.

04:59.814 --> 05:02.730
Sorry to be so sneaky,
but you probably do this

05:02.773 --> 05:05.384
-all the time.
-Not really.

05:05.428 --> 05:07.735
Okay. Can I get
your credit card?

05:07.778 --> 05:09.301
Yes, you may.

05:09.345 --> 05:12.653
And, uh, I am Mr. Jerry Walsh.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.872
Okay. And a photo ID?

05:14.916 --> 05:17.527
Say what now?

05:17.571 --> 05:18.876
I mean, obviously,
you're old enough.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.139
It's just company policy.
Is that gonna be a problem?

05:21.183 --> 05:22.358
No, that's not gonna be
a problem.

05:22.401 --> 05:23.707
I mean, why would it be
a problem? [chuckles]: You know.

05:23.751 --> 05:26.667
I'm sure I got it here
somewhere... somewhere.

05:26.710 --> 05:28.103
[whispers]:
Run!

05:28.146 --> 05:30.758
Run? I haven't run in 30 years.

05:30.801 --> 05:32.324
You can do it.

05:32.368 --> 05:34.631
No, actually, I can't.
I've got three fake hips

05:34.675 --> 05:37.591
'cause of a bet I lost
to that doctor in Costa Rica.

05:37.634 --> 05:39.810
All right, look, on my cue,
we're gonna snatch

05:39.854 --> 05:41.682
that credit card
and make a break for it.

05:41.725 --> 05:44.815
-I'm sorry. Where were we, now?
-Just to let you know,

05:44.859 --> 05:46.513
I could hear everything
you guys were saying.

05:47.601 --> 05:48.950
Run!

05:48.993 --> 05:51.126
You don't have to run.

05:51.169 --> 05:53.650
I'm not gonna chase you.

05:59.613 --> 06:01.832
What are you guys
trying to do to me?

06:01.876 --> 06:03.791
I mean, it feels
like it's becoming personal.

06:03.834 --> 06:04.574
Is it personal?

06:04.618 --> 06:06.837
Did I do something
to offend you?

06:06.881 --> 06:08.709
Well, you took our credit card.

06:08.752 --> 06:12.364
You know, some of us
aren't retired, Hank.

06:12.408 --> 06:14.715
Some of us are trying
to keep our jobs.

06:14.758 --> 06:17.152
That sounds
like a "you" problem.

06:17.195 --> 06:19.850
No. Actually,
it's a "you" problem.

06:19.894 --> 06:21.504
Actuallyactually,

06:21.548 --> 06:23.985
it's a "you and you and you"
problem.

06:24.028 --> 06:26.814
Because of you three,
I've got higher blood pressure

06:26.857 --> 06:28.293
than half the people in here.

06:28.337 --> 06:30.774
That sounds
like another "you" problem.

06:32.863 --> 06:34.865
I'm sorry about Jerry.

06:34.909 --> 06:36.954
But if we threw a rager
every time a person died,

06:36.998 --> 06:38.956
this place would look
like Bourbon Street.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.742
Bourbon Street's okay.
The best streets are...

06:41.785 --> 06:44.266
few blocks over.

06:44.309 --> 06:47.443
What I'm saying here, Sid,

06:47.486 --> 06:51.229
is that people want peace
and quiet.

06:51.273 --> 06:53.623
Peace and quiet?
I'm gonna have plenty

06:53.667 --> 06:55.451
of peace and quiet
when I'm dead.

06:55.494 --> 06:58.062
I want to party.
Jerry wanted to party.

06:58.106 --> 07:01.413
And nobody wants to party with
balloons and a cheese plate.

07:01.457 --> 07:02.806
What's so bad about that?

07:02.850 --> 07:06.244
Jerry hated cheese.
The man was lactose intolerant.

07:06.288 --> 07:09.421
I don't know what to tell you,
Hank. The rules are the rules.

07:09.465 --> 07:10.858
You don't like them,
you can leave.

07:10.901 --> 07:13.469
You do realize
you're all here voluntarily.

07:13.512 --> 07:16.037
What? We are?

07:16.080 --> 07:20.476
Yes. It's a retirement
community, not an insane asylum.

07:21.303 --> 07:23.740
My kids are liars.

07:24.698 --> 07:28.005
Well, voluntary or not,
the rules stink.

07:28.049 --> 07:29.441
And what qualifies you

07:29.485 --> 07:32.314
to come up
with these rules anyway, missy?

07:32.357 --> 07:33.794
I went
to Harvard Business School.

07:33.837 --> 07:35.099
I never heard of it.

07:35.143 --> 07:36.884
You've never heard of Harvard?

07:36.927 --> 07:38.450
[laughing]:
Oh, Harvard!

07:38.494 --> 07:42.803
I thought you said "Barnyard."

07:44.065 --> 07:46.241
I can't hear a thing today.

07:46.284 --> 07:49.026
That's a great school.

07:49.070 --> 07:52.943
All right, guys,
time to get out of my office.

07:52.987 --> 07:54.684
Well, if you're not gonna
let us throw a party,

07:54.728 --> 07:56.817
at least move what's-her-face
from our table.

07:56.860 --> 07:58.688
Who? Margaret?

07:58.732 --> 08:00.298
No, she can sit
wherever she wants.

08:00.342 --> 08:01.822
There's nothing
I can do about it.

08:01.865 --> 08:03.954
Oh, I get it.

08:03.998 --> 08:06.304
So you're saying
there's nothing youcan do.

08:06.348 --> 08:08.698
-Right.
-So you want us to handle it.

08:08.742 --> 08:09.917
That's what you're saying.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.962
That's not at all
what I'm saying.

08:12.006 --> 08:14.312
Ah, it's cool.
I hear you, baby.

08:14.356 --> 08:17.185
I feel like you don't.

08:17.228 --> 08:19.317
Ah, I got it. Say no more.

08:19.361 --> 08:21.363
I feel like I should.

08:21.406 --> 08:24.366
Mm. Let's roll, boys.

08:24.409 --> 08:27.412
Walked right
into that one, Harvard.

08:40.643 --> 08:43.602
SID:
You want me to flirt with her?

08:43.646 --> 08:45.213
I don't think I can do this.

08:45.256 --> 08:47.650
You want that woman sitting
at our table forever?

08:47.694 --> 08:49.173
Trust me, this'll work.

08:49.217 --> 08:53.612
But it should be you or Charlie
or at least somebody straight.

08:53.656 --> 08:56.746
Sid, only a gay man
can hit on a woman these days.

08:56.790 --> 08:59.749
If I so much as bump
into the side of a tata,

08:59.793 --> 09:02.317
I could wind up in jail
for six years.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.972
I did six years in jail.
Wasn't so bad.

09:05.015 --> 09:06.974
-I was in the best shape
of my...
-Charlie.

09:07.017 --> 09:10.760
Now, Sid, your mere presence
makes most people uncomfortable.

09:10.804 --> 09:12.762
Now, all you got to do
is, is take that

09:12.806 --> 09:14.546
and dial that up to,
like, an 11.

09:14.590 --> 09:16.374
She'll be running
to another table in no time.

09:16.418 --> 09:18.420
Fine. Here goes nothing.

09:18.463 --> 09:21.423
I'll take off my glasses
so I look more butch.

09:32.826 --> 09:34.958
Well, hello, little lady.

09:37.831 --> 09:38.962
Are you all right?

09:39.006 --> 09:41.443
Do you mind if I join you?

09:41.486 --> 09:44.751
How can I resist?

09:52.846 --> 09:55.022
-Where are your friends?
-Well, they're not hiding,

09:55.065 --> 09:56.023
if that's what you're asking.

09:57.415 --> 09:59.896
I wasn't.

10:00.984 --> 10:02.943
So, I know a man is not supposed

10:02.986 --> 10:06.598
to say these things when sitting
with a woman these days,

10:06.642 --> 10:10.602
but if you really want
Jerry's seat,

10:10.646 --> 10:13.170
I know a way you can earn it.

10:13.214 --> 10:14.868
Through me.

10:15.869 --> 10:17.261
Really?

10:17.305 --> 10:19.742
What would I have to do?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.963
Well, you know, uh,

10:23.006 --> 10:26.488
man-woman stuff.

10:26.531 --> 10:27.837
I don't know.

10:27.881 --> 10:30.057
Why don't you give me
the details?

10:32.146 --> 10:33.974
Well, you know, when a...

10:34.017 --> 10:37.804
man takes a woman
and unhooks things and...

10:40.110 --> 10:42.112
...takes liberties
with her person.

10:42.156 --> 10:43.331
You know the rest.

10:43.374 --> 10:46.334
No, still lost.

10:46.377 --> 10:48.205
He puts his lips on things,

10:48.249 --> 10:50.904
and-and his hands go everywhere.

10:50.947 --> 10:54.951
Cheese and crackers,
don't make me keep saying it!

10:56.083 --> 10:57.127
Well, all right.

10:57.171 --> 10:58.737
Why don't we go back to my room

10:58.781 --> 11:00.870
and you can show me instead?

11:00.914 --> 11:04.134
No, I think I made myself
perfectly clear.

11:04.178 --> 11:05.570
No, no, no, no, no, no.

11:05.614 --> 11:07.442
I want you to showme.

11:07.485 --> 11:09.226
Come on, lover boy.

11:09.270 --> 11:10.837
Get up.

11:17.060 --> 11:19.584
Well, maybe this will work out
in our favor.

11:19.628 --> 11:21.064
I mean, if you slept with Sid,

11:21.108 --> 11:22.892
would you really want
to sit next to him all day?

11:22.936 --> 11:25.068
[sighs]
It's Sid I'm worried about.

11:25.112 --> 11:29.812
If she goes anywhere near his
penis, his heart could explode.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.292
I've seen
a man's heart explode once.

11:31.335 --> 11:32.684
It's not pretty.

11:32.728 --> 11:34.599
When did you see
a man's heart explode?

11:34.643 --> 11:36.384
How you gonna see that?
It's inside his body.

11:36.427 --> 11:38.255
Well, it-it came out!

11:38.299 --> 11:39.735
Way out!

11:39.778 --> 11:41.171
All right, all right, Charlie,

11:41.215 --> 11:44.131
I'm gonna stop asking you
questions.

11:44.174 --> 11:45.959
[laughs]
So, three hours later,

11:46.002 --> 11:47.395
I wake up on the floor

11:47.438 --> 11:50.398
next to a longshoreman,
with a rubber tube in my hand.

11:50.441 --> 11:54.271
And I'm thinking to myself, "Did
he get the enema or was it me?"

11:54.315 --> 11:55.707
-My God!
-[laughing]

11:55.751 --> 11:58.145
-I've been there! [laughs]
-[sighs]

11:58.188 --> 11:59.711
What the hell is this?

11:59.755 --> 12:01.713
Oh, speaking of enemas,

12:01.757 --> 12:04.281
look who just showed up.

12:04.325 --> 12:06.196
You told her, didn't you?

12:06.240 --> 12:08.503
I'm sorry, Hank.
She knew what I was doing

12:08.546 --> 12:10.157
and she flipped it on me.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.375
You were supposed
to scare her away,

12:11.419 --> 12:13.290
not swap booty stories with her.

12:13.334 --> 12:15.423
She found my weakness.

12:15.466 --> 12:17.164
Come on, Sid, let's go.

12:17.207 --> 12:19.079
No, actually...

12:19.122 --> 12:21.081
I want to stay.

12:21.124 --> 12:22.560
You want to what?

12:22.604 --> 12:24.736
I want to hear
the end of the story.

12:24.780 --> 12:28.566
Plus, I wouldn't mind hearing
the first part of that story.

12:28.610 --> 12:30.046
I can't believe you guys.

12:30.090 --> 12:32.657
You want to sit here eating
chips with this seat stealer?

12:32.701 --> 12:34.659
Then you go right ahead.

12:34.703 --> 12:37.575
I hope your guacamole tastes
like betrayal.

12:39.577 --> 12:42.537
â™ª

12:42.580 --> 12:44.234
$75!

12:44.278 --> 12:45.975
Do I hear $75

12:46.019 --> 12:49.413
for a chance to sit at the best
table in all of Shady Meadows?

12:49.457 --> 12:50.806
$75.

12:50.849 --> 12:52.460
Dudley? No, man.

12:52.503 --> 12:54.157
You must be kidding me.

12:54.201 --> 12:56.203
Hank, what's all this about?

12:56.246 --> 12:58.205
Well, since you all
are disrespecting Jerry,

12:58.248 --> 12:59.989
I decided I'm gonna auction off
your seats

13:00.033 --> 13:03.036
so I can raise money
to pay for his memorial service.

13:03.079 --> 13:05.342
What? You can't sell our seats.

13:05.386 --> 13:06.996
$90.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.128
$95.

13:08.171 --> 13:09.129
$100.

13:09.172 --> 13:10.782
-$110.
-$115.

13:10.826 --> 13:12.915
$1 million.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.569
That's too steep for me.

13:14.612 --> 13:16.701
I'm out.

13:16.745 --> 13:18.834
You know you don't have
no million dollars.

13:18.877 --> 13:20.270
Well, not on me.
But if you got a shovel,

13:20.314 --> 13:23.143
we can go out to the desert.
[chuckles]

13:24.187 --> 13:26.146
Who is this fossil?

13:26.189 --> 13:28.583
That's Phillips.
That's his chair now.

13:28.626 --> 13:30.802
He paid $11 for that seat.

13:30.846 --> 13:32.717
[filtered breathing]

13:32.761 --> 13:35.068
[squeaking]

13:40.116 --> 13:42.466
I don't need this!

13:42.510 --> 13:43.815
I'm out of here!

13:43.859 --> 13:46.166
No refunds, Phillips!

13:46.209 --> 13:49.082
Woman, you are working
my last nerve.

13:49.125 --> 13:51.258
Hank, maybe it's time
to let it go.

13:51.301 --> 13:54.043
We're not gonna have
a big party.

13:54.087 --> 13:57.220
We're just gonna sit here,
eat cheese, break wind,

13:57.264 --> 13:59.222
and stare at Jerry's ashes.

13:59.266 --> 14:00.484
Wait, hold up now. Ashes?

14:00.528 --> 14:02.269
They can't cremate Jerry.

14:02.312 --> 14:04.271
-Why not?
-The man is Irish.

14:04.314 --> 14:07.056
And the Irish like
their dead bodies in a open box

14:07.100 --> 14:08.318
in the middle of a bar.

14:08.362 --> 14:09.972
Then they drink whiskey,

14:10.016 --> 14:11.930
then they sing songs,
then they fight each other.

14:11.974 --> 14:14.150
Sometimes they fight
the dead body.

14:15.456 --> 14:17.849
[chuckling]:
What the hell are you saying?

14:17.893 --> 14:19.851
I'm saying
we got to hop in a cab

14:19.895 --> 14:21.288
and go on down to that morgue

14:21.331 --> 14:22.985
and get Jerry
the hell out of there.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.553
Have you lost
your ever-loving mind?

14:25.596 --> 14:27.076
We can't do that.

14:27.120 --> 14:31.080
Plus, no cab driver will let you
transport a dead body.

14:31.124 --> 14:34.431
I did it all the time when I was
a rickshaw driver in Bangkok.

14:34.475 --> 14:37.217
Charlie,
I'm gonna take my thumb,

14:37.260 --> 14:39.306
I'm gonna push it on
your eyeball

14:39.349 --> 14:42.004
till it pops out your ear.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.137
Now, does anybody here
have a-- have a car?

14:44.180 --> 14:45.486
I can drive you guys.

14:45.529 --> 14:47.357
Ah, hell, no. Anybody else?

14:47.401 --> 14:49.664
I can drive if you guys tell me

14:49.707 --> 14:51.666
what I'm seeing out
the windshield.

14:51.709 --> 14:53.929
It's your life.

14:53.972 --> 14:56.366
Okay, fine, but this doesn't
make us friends.

14:56.410 --> 14:59.282
And I'm driving.

15:01.371 --> 15:03.721
-Watch your blind spot.
-All right.

15:03.765 --> 15:06.246
-She's braking.
-Mm-hmm.

15:06.289 --> 15:07.116
Pull over...

15:07.160 --> 15:10.250
Man, Sid, why you got
to sit like that?

15:10.293 --> 15:11.729
You're blocking my view.

15:11.773 --> 15:13.470
Well, I can't see out the window

15:13.514 --> 15:15.168
if I sit in the seat.

15:15.211 --> 15:16.995
Margaret's blocking myview.

15:17.039 --> 15:19.041
Do you have to see out
the front window?

15:19.085 --> 15:21.522
It's a car; they have windows
on the sides.

15:21.565 --> 15:23.263
I get motion sickness.

15:23.306 --> 15:24.916
I'm scared I'll spit up.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.049
Don't you spit up on me.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.485
You really have to slow down,
Hank.

15:28.529 --> 15:29.921
You're going too fast.

15:29.965 --> 15:31.401
Well, it's too late
for all that.

15:31.445 --> 15:33.229
They're probably popping Jerry
in the oven

15:33.273 --> 15:34.622
-as we speak.
-Oh.

15:34.665 --> 15:36.189
And that said,
how fast am I going?

15:36.232 --> 15:37.929
Which one of these dials
is your speedometer?

15:37.973 --> 15:39.279
I don't know.

15:39.322 --> 15:41.716
You don't know how to read
your own speedometer?

15:41.759 --> 15:43.283
It's not my car.

15:43.326 --> 15:44.936
Well, whose car is it, then?

15:44.980 --> 15:47.374
It's that Dudley guy's;
I swiped his key.

15:47.417 --> 15:48.984
I thought you said
you had a car.

15:49.027 --> 15:50.942
I said I could drive a car.

15:50.986 --> 15:52.379
I never said that I had one.

15:52.422 --> 15:54.729
-So I'm driving a stolen car.
-[siren chirps]

15:54.772 --> 15:57.079
Oh, Lord,
we're getting pulled over.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.735
I told you to slow down.
[gags]

16:00.778 --> 16:03.303
Oh, this is no good.

16:03.346 --> 16:06.741
A black man in a stolen car
with a white woman?

16:06.784 --> 16:10.266
All right, everybody just relax,
act like we have Alzheimer's.

16:13.922 --> 16:16.751
â™ª

16:16.794 --> 16:21.538
Well, the good news is they
bought your dementia story.

16:21.582 --> 16:22.670
The bad news is,

16:22.713 --> 16:24.367
Jerry has seen better days.

16:24.411 --> 16:26.978
Oh, I don't know. I think
he looks good in red.

16:27.022 --> 16:28.371
Woman, don't you start with me.

16:28.415 --> 16:29.764
This is all your fault.

16:29.807 --> 16:31.244
From the moment
you came up in here,

16:31.287 --> 16:32.636
ain't been nothing but trouble.

16:32.680 --> 16:35.422
'Cause of you, Jerry will never
get his open casket.

16:35.465 --> 16:37.337
Why don't you just flip the lid?

16:37.380 --> 16:38.468
Eh, don't you touch him.

16:38.512 --> 16:40.340
Don't you touch him.

16:40.383 --> 16:43.430
Shoot, knowing you,
you're liable to drop him.

16:43.473 --> 16:46.563
-[gasps] No!
-[Hank screams]

16:46.607 --> 16:48.783
Oh. [cries]

16:48.826 --> 16:52.090
Boy, you don't see that
every day.

16:52.134 --> 16:54.571
Maybe I can find a broom,

16:54.615 --> 16:57.487
we could sweep him into
a little zip-it bag.

16:57.531 --> 16:59.010
The-the dag zip-it?

16:59.054 --> 17:01.361
They put the zip-it
a thunda snug.

17:01.404 --> 17:03.058
He's talking gibberish.

17:03.101 --> 17:05.060
-[crying]
-I-Is he having a stroke?

17:05.103 --> 17:07.802
He might be. I say it's best
we all just walk away.

17:07.845 --> 17:10.370
We aren't getting the Jerry
pieces back in the bottle.

17:10.413 --> 17:12.241
Get-- Bring-bring--
get-get the glue

17:12.285 --> 17:15.070
with-with the thing on it, man.
Oh, Lord.

17:20.902 --> 17:23.296
â™ª

17:23.339 --> 17:26.516
Okay, Jerry,
I'm gonna rent a cannon,

17:26.560 --> 17:29.824
then we'll tuck you inside,
then I'm gonna blast you

17:29.867 --> 17:32.305
right upside that woman's head.

17:32.348 --> 17:36.657
You know, Hank, I think
it's time to let it go.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.702
You know, when I was in
the Navy,

17:38.746 --> 17:40.400
I had a little saying:

17:40.443 --> 17:45.056
"When the sea gets choppy,
don't go on the boat."

17:45.100 --> 17:46.754
Of course,
the sea is always choppy,

17:46.797 --> 17:48.321
so I got
a dishonorable discharge

17:48.364 --> 17:49.974
for dereliction of duties.

17:50.018 --> 17:53.456
I had a whole different saying
about the Navy.

17:57.939 --> 18:01.508
But now's not the time
or the place.

18:01.551 --> 18:05.338
Now, Hank, my point is that

18:05.381 --> 18:08.515
I don't think you're mad
at that woman.

18:08.558 --> 18:10.952
And I don't think you're mad
about Jerry's party.

18:10.995 --> 18:12.562
I think you're scared.

18:12.606 --> 18:14.651
We all are.

18:14.695 --> 18:18.351
'Cause one day it's gonna be
about our crappy party

18:18.394 --> 18:21.354
and who gets to sit
in our seat.

18:21.397 --> 18:24.922
And just like that...
we're forgotten.

18:24.966 --> 18:26.446
You know, Charlie,

18:26.489 --> 18:29.100
that's the most lucid thing
I've ever heard you say.

18:29.144 --> 18:30.101
Thank you.

18:30.145 --> 18:33.453
And you are 100% incorrect!

18:33.496 --> 18:37.457
You guys remember when I lost
my wife to the big man upstairs?

18:37.500 --> 18:39.328
I thought your wife left you.

18:39.372 --> 18:40.721
She did... for the retired

18:40.764 --> 18:44.464
football player who lived
in the penthouse.

18:44.507 --> 18:48.381
See, that's when I moved
in here and I met you guys.

18:48.424 --> 18:51.340
I tell you what, Jerry,
even at my lowest,

18:51.384 --> 18:53.560
he showed me that life
could still be fun.

18:53.603 --> 18:57.433
And if I'm scared,
maybe I'm just scared

18:57.477 --> 18:59.957
that it's not gonna be any fun
around here anymore,

19:00.001 --> 19:01.394
now that Jerry's gone.

19:01.437 --> 19:05.398
Well, maybe we don't need Jerry
to have fun.

19:05.441 --> 19:08.183
Hell, we had one heck of a day
with that woman.

19:08.226 --> 19:10.620
[all laugh]

19:10.664 --> 19:13.797
Jerry never got us arrested.

19:13.841 --> 19:17.497
Yeah, he never stole a car,
and that was fun.

19:17.540 --> 19:20.587
Yeah, but that woman,
she just gets under my skin.

19:20.630 --> 19:23.503
Well, Jerry got under
everybody's skin.

19:23.546 --> 19:26.506
He used to replace
my beta blockers

19:26.549 --> 19:28.551
with boner pills.

19:29.813 --> 19:31.380
It was a joke.

19:31.424 --> 19:33.339
Not to my poor little pecker.

19:34.601 --> 19:36.429
Okay. Okay, Sid.

19:36.472 --> 19:37.778
[loud music playing]

19:37.821 --> 19:40.302
What the hell is that?

19:40.346 --> 19:42.522
-[indistinct chatter]
-[music continues]

19:51.574 --> 19:53.184
Oh, I'm sorry,
you guys can't come in here.

19:53.228 --> 19:54.664
You have to be invited.

19:55.796 --> 19:57.188
I'm just kidding.

19:57.232 --> 19:59.800
[laughs] Surprise.
Here's your party.

19:59.843 --> 20:02.193
This was you? You did this?

20:02.237 --> 20:03.847
You're welcome.

20:03.891 --> 20:05.762
How? What did you tell Allison?

20:05.806 --> 20:07.808
Well, I said,
[crying]: "Please let me throw

20:07.851 --> 20:09.679
"this party for the boys.

20:09.723 --> 20:12.769
"I mean, I'm here all alone
and nobody likes me very much.

20:12.813 --> 20:15.076
Please."

20:15.119 --> 20:16.773
-And that worked?
-No.

20:16.817 --> 20:19.472
So I slipped her a sleeping pill
and knocked the bitch out.

20:20.821 --> 20:22.475
[laughs] See?

20:22.518 --> 20:24.694
She's way more fun than Jerry.

20:24.738 --> 20:27.349
You know, I talked everything
over with the guys,

20:27.393 --> 20:28.568
and despite their objections,

20:28.611 --> 20:30.352
I think you should take
Jerry's seat.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.485
-Well, I accept.
-On a probationary basis.

20:32.528 --> 20:34.225
Just as long as you know,
I'm still

20:34.269 --> 20:35.444
gonna be calling
the shots around here.

20:35.488 --> 20:37.490
Well, we'll-we'll see
about that.

20:37.533 --> 20:39.448
What-what do you mean by
"we'll see about that"?

20:39.492 --> 20:41.363
-Never mind.
-What? No, I changed my mind.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.582
-We shouldn't be doing this.
-Ah.

20:42.625 --> 20:44.061
You know, I think I might
take your chair.

20:44.105 --> 20:45.454
I believe it has a better view.

20:45.498 --> 20:47.021
N-N-N-N-N-No. Nah. Uh-uh.

20:47.064 --> 20:48.588
[stammers]

20:48.631 --> 20:50.720
She can't put the, put-put the,
put the thing

20:50.764 --> 20:52.026
on the, on the moova.

20:52.069 --> 20:55.159
[speaking gibberish]

20:57.074 --> 20:58.685
So there I am,

20:58.728 --> 21:01.035
halftime at the Super Bowl
operating camera five,

21:01.078 --> 21:04.734
and I-- and over my headset
I hear, "Cut to Janet Jackson."

21:04.778 --> 21:06.301
[all laugh]

21:06.344 --> 21:09.609
Excuse me, Ms. Walsh?

21:09.652 --> 21:11.741
Oh, you can call me Jerry.

21:11.785 --> 21:14.178
I hate to bother you, but your
credit card has been declined.

21:14.222 --> 21:16.137
Oh, no, there must be
some mistake.

21:16.180 --> 21:17.486
I've tried it several times.

21:17.530 --> 21:19.706
All right.
Well, hold your horses.

21:19.749 --> 21:21.490
I'll get you a different c-card.

21:21.534 --> 21:23.274
I'm gonna go, uh, get my--

21:23.318 --> 21:25.102
I'm gonna-- Run!

21:28.932 --> 21:31.935
Sir? Oh! [gasps]

21:31.979 --> 21:33.676
That's pretty good.

21:38.725 --> 21:40.727
You've made the cut
withThe Cool Kids.
