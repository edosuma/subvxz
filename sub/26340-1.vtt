WEBVTT

00:00.428 --> 00:02.081
Only on Fox.

00:09.263 --> 00:12.701
Okay, boys,
this one's for Jerry.

00:12.744 --> 00:14.355
May he rest in peace.

00:14.398 --> 00:17.836
One for me, one for you,
and one for you.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.361
D-Do not peer pressure me.
I haven't taken my pills yet.

00:20.404 --> 00:22.014
Do you know what happens
when you mix

00:22.058 --> 00:23.842
prescription drugs and alcohol?

00:23.886 --> 00:25.496
Yeah, a good time.

00:25.540 --> 00:30.022
I wouldn't do it.
I once mixed six tabs of acid

00:30.066 --> 00:31.589
with some New England
hard cider.

00:31.633 --> 00:33.591
Long story short,

00:33.635 --> 00:36.812
I can't eat apples
with my clothes on anymore.

00:36.855 --> 00:39.728
Let's raise a glass.
[clears throat]

00:39.771 --> 00:42.165
Jerry, what can I say?

00:42.209 --> 00:44.602
You were the most ornery,
foul-mouthed,

00:44.646 --> 00:50.260
mentally deranged son of a bitch
I ever met, and thank God I did.

00:50.304 --> 00:52.175
-We're gonna miss you, old pal.
-Yeah, we are.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.482
-To Jerry.
-To Jerry.
-To Jerry!

00:56.310 --> 00:58.486
[all exhaling]

00:58.529 --> 01:01.837
So, should we talk replacements?

01:01.880 --> 01:03.404
Have you lost your mind?

01:03.447 --> 01:06.276
Well, it is a prime seat.
We got to move fast.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.540
Now, look, guys, you know
we can never replace Jerry.

01:09.584 --> 01:10.976
The man was a legend.

01:11.020 --> 01:12.630
So I say we honor his legacy

01:12.674 --> 01:15.242
the way it should be honored,
with an empty seat.

01:17.896 --> 01:19.333
Do you mind?

01:19.376 --> 01:22.423
It has been a bitch
of a morning.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.991
Uh, hey, baby, you must be lost.

01:26.035 --> 01:28.124
Don't start, flyboy.

01:28.167 --> 01:31.301
I'm not in the mood
and I am not interested.

01:33.477 --> 01:35.218
Look, lady, I don't know
who you are,

01:35.262 --> 01:37.394
but you can't sit there.

01:37.438 --> 01:40.354
Why not? Who are you guys,
the cool kids?

01:40.397 --> 01:42.225
Damn straight we are.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.662
[laughing]:
You...

01:44.706 --> 01:45.576
Really?

01:46.838 --> 01:49.014
Him? Wow.

01:50.929 --> 01:52.453
I don't know
where you came from,

01:52.496 --> 01:54.455
but you can't sit
wherever you want.

01:54.498 --> 01:55.586
You got to be invited.

01:55.630 --> 01:57.501
He's right. You have
to earn that spot.

01:57.545 --> 01:59.982
Fine. I'll arm wrestle
you for it.

02:00.025 --> 02:03.942
-Fine.
-Wait, wait, S-Sid. Ooh.

02:06.380 --> 02:09.774
Did better than I thought.
[chuckles]

02:09.818 --> 02:11.689
Look, you gots to go.

02:11.733 --> 02:13.387
That seat belongs to Jerry.

02:13.430 --> 02:16.564
Is that right?
Where is this Jerry?

02:16.607 --> 02:18.479
ALLISON [over speaker]:
Good morning, Shady Meadows.

02:18.522 --> 02:21.351
I'm sorry to announce
that Jerry Walsh

02:21.395 --> 02:22.700
passed away yesterday.

02:22.744 --> 02:24.485
There'll be free balloons
and a cheese plate

02:24.528 --> 02:27.270
available in his memory.
Have a nice day.

02:28.663 --> 02:30.621
Jerry?

02:30.665 --> 02:32.580
What is your problem?

02:32.623 --> 02:34.277
Why you want to sit
at our table so bad, anyway?

02:34.321 --> 02:35.365
You know, honestly, I don't,

02:35.409 --> 02:37.454
but then you told me
that I couldn't.

02:37.498 --> 02:40.283
So now you are gonna need
a hearse to drag me out of here

02:40.327 --> 02:44.418
because nobody tells me
what to do. Nobody.

02:45.636 --> 02:47.986
You want me
to arm-wrestle her again?

02:48.030 --> 02:50.337
I think I'm getting
a second wind.

02:53.557 --> 02:55.603
♪

03:15.666 --> 03:18.452
That woman is violent.

03:18.495 --> 03:21.237
I think she broke my elbow.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.500
Times sure have changed.

03:23.544 --> 03:25.241
I mean, in the '50s,
a woman wouldn't dare

03:25.284 --> 03:26.764
just come sit at our table
like that.

03:26.808 --> 03:30.115
In the '50s, you wouldn't have
been allowed in the restaurant.

03:31.726 --> 03:33.554
I'd have been allowed in,
but I'd have had

03:33.597 --> 03:35.469
[deep voice]:
to talk like this.

03:37.906 --> 03:39.777
Plus, she disrespected Jerry.

03:39.821 --> 03:41.213
And speaking of Jerry,

03:41.257 --> 03:42.824
we need to talk
about his memorial service.

03:42.867 --> 03:45.522
Why do we have to talk about it?
Aren't they gonna give him one?

03:45.566 --> 03:48.656
A cheese plate and balloons
is not a service.

03:48.699 --> 03:50.353
-Jerry liked to party.
-Yeah.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.137
He would want something epic.

03:52.181 --> 03:55.489
You know, like kegs and a DJ,
fireworks,

03:55.532 --> 03:58.622
people getting butt naked
up in here.

03:58.666 --> 04:02.147
We need to throw something
like a Burning Man.

04:02.191 --> 04:04.019
You want to burn a man?

04:04.062 --> 04:06.151
No, it's a sex festival
in the desert.

04:06.195 --> 04:07.501
I go every year.

04:07.544 --> 04:12.549
Well, Allison is not gonna
let you throw a party.

04:12.593 --> 04:15.291
She runs this place
like Alcatraz.

04:15.334 --> 04:17.815
Don't worry about Allison.
We gonna go around her.

04:17.859 --> 04:20.514
Yeah, but a party like that's
gonna cost a lot of dough.

04:20.557 --> 04:24.605
Money? Oh, that's not
gonna be a problem.

04:24.648 --> 04:26.824
Well, why? You came
into some scratch?

04:26.868 --> 04:30.349
Well... I got this. [laughs]

04:30.393 --> 04:33.483
Is that Jerry's credit card?

04:33.527 --> 04:35.616
How the hell did you get
Jerry's credit card?

04:35.659 --> 04:37.531
Well, how does
anything happen, Hank?

04:37.574 --> 04:39.707
You're not the only one
with good ideas.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.627
Why is this still loose?

04:49.238 --> 04:51.501
Hey, do you know
where the supply closet is?

04:51.545 --> 04:54.765
No, nuh-uh.
Do you know how to fix a table?

04:54.809 --> 04:56.724
Psst! Come on, over here.

04:57.812 --> 04:59.770
Hurry up, man, come on.

04:59.814 --> 05:02.730
Sorry to be so sneaky,
but you probably do this

05:02.773 --> 05:05.384
-all the time.
-Not really.

05:05.428 --> 05:07.735
Okay. Can I get
your credit card?

05:07.778 --> 05:09.301
Yes, you may.

05:09.345 --> 05:12.653
And, uh, I am Mr. Jerry Walsh.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.872
Okay. And a photo ID?

05:14.916 --> 05:17.527
Say what now?

05:17.571 --> 05:18.876
I mean, obviously,
you're old enough.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.139
It's just company policy.
Is that gonna be a problem?

05:21.183 --> 05:22.358
No, that's not gonna be
a problem.

05:22.401 --> 05:23.707
I mean, why would it be
a problem? [chuckles]: You know.

05:23.751 --> 05:26.667
I'm sure I got it here
somewhere... somewhere.

05:26.710 --> 05:28.103
[whispers]:
Run!

05:28.146 --> 05:30.758
Run? I haven't run in 30 years.

05:30.801 --> 05:32.324
You can do it.

05:32.368 --> 05:34.631
No, actually, I can't.
I've got three fake hips

05:34.675 --> 05:37.591
'cause of a bet I lost
to that doctor in Costa Rica.

05:37.634 --> 05:39.810
All right, look, on my cue,
we're gonna snatch

05:39.854 --> 05:41.682
that credit card
and make a break for it.

05:41.725 --> 05:44.815
-I'm sorry. Where were we, now?
-Just to let you know,

05:44.859 --> 05:46.513
I could hear everything
you guys were saying.

05:47.601 --> 05:48.950
Run!

05:48.993 --> 05:51.126
You don't have to run.

05:51.169 --> 05:53.650
I'm not gonna chase you.

05:59.613 --> 06:01.832
What are you guys
trying to do to me?

06:01.876 --> 06:03.791
I mean, it feels
like it's becoming personal.

06:03.834 --> 06:04.574
Is it personal?

06:04.618 --> 06:06.837
Did I do something
to offend you?

06:06.881 --> 06:08.709
Well, you took our credit card.

06:08.752 --> 06:12.364
You know, some of us
aren't retired, Hank.

06:12.408 --> 06:14.715
Some of us are trying
to keep our jobs.

06:14.758 --> 06:17.152
That sounds
like a "you" problem.

06:17.195 --> 06:19.850
No. Actually,
it's a "you" problem.

06:19.894 --> 06:21.504
Actuallyactually,

06:21.548 --> 06:23.985
it's a "you and you and you"
problem.

06:24.028 --> 06:26.814
Because of you three,
I've got higher blood pressure

06:26.857 --> 06:28.293
than half the people in here.

06:28.337 --> 06:30.774
That sounds
like another "you" problem.

06:32.863 --> 06:34.865
I'm sorry about Jerry.

06:34.909 --> 06:36.954
But if we threw a rager
every time a person died,

06:36.998 --> 06:38.956
this place would look
like Bourbon Street.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.742
Bourbon Street's okay.
The best streets are...

06:41.785 --> 06:44.266
few blocks over.

06:44.309 --> 06:47.443
What I'm saying here, Sid,

06:47.486 --> 06:51.229
is that people want peace
and quiet.

06:51.273 --> 06:53.623
Peace and quiet?
I'm gonna have plenty

06:53.667 --> 06:55.451
of peace and quiet
when I'm dead.

06:55.494 --> 06:58.062
I want to party.
Jerry wanted to party.

06:58.106 --> 07:01.413
And nobody wants to party with
balloons and a cheese plate.

07:01.457 --> 07:02.806
What's so bad about that?

07:02.850 --> 07:06.244
Jerry hated cheese.
The man was lactose intolerant.

07:06.288 --> 07:09.421
I don't know what to tell you,
Hank. The rules are the rules.

07:09.465 --> 07:10.858
You don't like them,
you can leave.

07:10.901 --> 07:13.469
You do realize
you're all here voluntarily.

07:13.512 --> 07:16.037
What? We are?

07:16.080 --> 07:20.476
Yes. It's a retirement
community, not an insane asylum.

07:21.303 --> 07:23.740
My kids are liars.

07:24.698 --> 07:28.005
Well, voluntary or not,
the rules stink.

07:28.049 --> 07:29.441
And what qualifies you

07:29.485 --> 07:32.314
to come up
with these rules anyway, missy?

07:32.357 --> 07:33.794
I went
to Harvard Business School.

07:33.837 --> 07:35.099
I never heard of it.

07:35.143 --> 07:36.884
You've never heard of Harvard?

07:36.927 --> 07:38.450
[laughing]:
Oh, Harvard!

07:38.494 --> 07:42.803
I thought you said "Barnyard."

07:44.065 --> 07:46.241
I can't hear a thing today.

07:46.284 --> 07:49.026
That's a great school.

07:49.070 --> 07:52.943
All right, guys,
time to get out of my office.

07:52.987 --> 07:54.684
Well, if you're not gonna
let us throw a party,

07:54.728 --> 07:56.817
at least move what's-her-face
from our table.

07:56.860 --> 07:58.688
Who? Margaret?

07:58.732 --> 08:00.298
No, she can sit
wherever she wants.

08:00.342 --> 08:01.822
There's nothing
I can do about it.

08:01.865 --> 08:03.954
Oh, I get it.

08:03.998 --> 08:06.304
So you're saying
there's nothing youcan do.

08:06.348 --> 08:08.698
-Right.
-So you want us to handle it.

08:08.742 --> 08:09.917
That's what you're saying.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.962
That's not at all
what I'm saying.

08:12.006 --> 08:14.312
Ah, it's cool.
I hear you, baby.

08:14.356 --> 08:17.185
I feel like you don't.

08:17.228 --> 08:19.317
Ah, I got it. Say no more.

08:19.361 --> 08:21.363
I feel like I should.

08:21.406 --> 08:24.366
Mm. Let's roll, boys.

08:24.409 --> 08:27.412
Walked right
into that one, Harvard.

08:40.643 --> 08:43.602
SID:
You want me to flirt with her?

08:43.646 --> 08:45.213
I don't think I can do this.

08:45.256 --> 08:47.650
You want that woman sitting
at our table forever?

08:47.694 --> 08:49.173
Trust me, this'll work.

08:49.217 --> 08:53.612
But it should be you or Charlie
or at least somebody straight.

08:53.656 --> 08:56.746
Sid, only a gay man
can hit on a woman these days.

08:56.790 --> 08:59.749
If I so much as bump
into the side of a tata,

08:59.793 --> 09:02.317
I could wind up in jail
for six years.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.972
I did six years in jail.
Wasn't so bad.

09:05.015 --> 09:06.974
-I was in the best shape
of my...
-Charlie.

09:07.017 --> 09:10.760
Now, Sid, your mere presence
makes most people uncomfortable.

09:10.804 --> 09:12.762
Now, all you got to do
is, is take that

09:12.806 --> 09:14.546
and dial that up to,
like, an 11.

09:14.590 --> 09:16.374
She'll be running
to another table in no time.

09:16.418 --> 09:18.420
Fine. Here goes nothing.

09:18.463 --> 09:21.423
I'll take off my glasses
so I look more butch.

09:32.826 --> 09:34.958
Well, hello, little lady.

09:37.831 --> 09:38.962
Are you all right?

09:39.006 --> 09:41.443
Do you mind if I join you?

09:41.486 --> 09:44.751
How can I resist?

09:52.846 --> 09:55.022
-Where are your friends?
-Well, they're not hiding,

09:55.065 --> 09:56.023
if that's what you're asking.

09:57.415 --> 09:59.896
I wasn't.

10:00.984 --> 10:02.943
So, I know a man is not supposed

10:02.986 --> 10:06.598
to say these things when sitting
with a woman these days,

10:06.642 --> 10:10.602
but if you really want
Jerry's seat,

10:10.646 --> 10:13.170
I know a way you can earn it.

10:13.214 --> 10:14.868
Through me.

10:15.869 --> 10:17.261
Really?

10:17.305 --> 10:19.742
What would I have to do?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.963
Well, you know, uh,

10:23.006 --> 10:26.488
man-woman stuff.

10:26.531 --> 10:27.837
I don't know.

10:27.881 --> 10:30.057
Why don't you give me
the details?

10:32.146 --> 10:33.974
Well, you know, when a...

10:34.017 --> 10:37.804
man takes a woman
and unhooks things and...

10:40.110 --> 10:42.112
...takes liberties
with her person.

10:42.156 --> 10:43.331
You know the rest.

10:43.374 --> 10:46.334
No, still lost.

10:46.377 --> 10:48.205
He puts his lips on things,

10:48.249 --> 10:50.904
and-and his hands go everywhere.

10:50.947 --> 10:54.951
Cheese and crackers,
don't make me keep saying it!

10:56.083 --> 10:57.127
Well, all right.

10:57.171 --> 10:58.737
Why don't we go back to my room

10:58.781 --> 11:00.870
and you can show me instead?

20:28.611 --> 20:30.352
I think you should take
Jerry's seat.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.485
-Well, I accept.
-On a probationary basis.

20:32.528 --> 20:34.225
Just as long as you know,
I'm still

20:34.269 --> 20:35.444
gonna be calling
the shots around here.

20:35.488 --> 20:37.490
Well, we'll-we'll see
about that.

20:37.533 --> 20:39.448
What-what do you mean by
"we'll see about that"?

20:39.492 --> 20:41.363
-Never mind.
-What? No, I changed my mind.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.582
-We shouldn't be doing this.
-Ah.

20:42.625 --> 20:44.061
You know, I think I might
take your chair.

20:44.105 --> 20:45.454
I believe it has a better view.

20:45.498 --> 20:47.021
N-N-N-N-N-No. Nah. Uh-uh.

20:47.064 --> 20:48.588
[stammers]

20:48.631 --> 20:50.720
She can't put the, put-put the,
put the thing

20:50.764 --> 20:52.026
on the, on the moova.

20:52.069 --> 20:55.159
[speaking gibberish]

20:57.074 --> 20:58.685
So there I am,

20:58.728 --> 21:01.035
halftime at the Super Bowl
operating camera five,

21:01.078 --> 21:04.734
and I-- and over my headset
I hear, "Cut to Janet Jackson."

21:04.778 --> 21:06.301
[all laugh]

21:06.344 --> 21:09.609
Excuse me, Ms. Walsh?

21:09.652 --> 21:11.741
Oh, you can call me Jerry.

21:11.785 --> 21:14.178
I hate to bother you, but your
credit card has been declined.

21:14.222 --> 21:16.137
Oh, no, there must be
some mistake.

21:16.180 --> 21:17.486
I've tried it several times.

21:17.530 --> 21:19.706
All right.
Well, hold your horses.

21:19.749 --> 21:21.490
I'll get you a different c-card.

21:21.534 --> 21:23.274
I'm gonna go, uh, get my--

21:23.318 --> 21:25.102
I'm gonna-- Run!

21:28.932 --> 21:31.935
Sir? Oh! [gasps]

21:31.979 --> 21:33.676
That's pretty good.

21:38.725 --> 21:40.727
You've made the cut
withThe Cool Kids.
