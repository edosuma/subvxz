00:06.040 --> 00:08.850
Three, two, let's take
itoverhead on one...

00:12.240 --> 00:16.470
This is a classic,prewar
onebedroom, onebath...

00:16.630 --> 00:17.270
What?

00:17.550 --> 00:19.580
Oh. The cleaninglady's here.

00:19.660 --> 00:22.180
Please come back later.No polish.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.290
I live here.What're you doing?

00:24.350 --> 00:26.550
Oh. Haven't you heard?The
building's going condo.

00:26.620 --> 00:29.400
If you're planning on
buying,i'm wendy. We should talk.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.390
Well, I'm not buying,and
they can't just kick me out.

00:31.390 --> 00:34.800
No, they can't,but they
can hike your rent up.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.150
Way up.

00:36.260 --> 00:37.760
Let me show youthe bedroom.

00:37.860 --> 00:39.930
-Jack will tell youwhat to do next.
-What?

00:40.050 --> 00:44.050
Thanks, cindy.All right, now
we'regonna work those glutes.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.150
Hey, do youhave a minute?

00:50.150 --> 00:52.040
Good god, lemon,have you seen this?

00:52.630 --> 00:56.250
As I'm sure you'veconcluded from the
headline,don geiss'sestranged son bertram

00:56.390 --> 01:00.390
is suing hishalfsister kathyfor
control ofthe geiss family trust fund.

01:00.390 --> 01:03.930
They could've done,"geiss
screams, son pay!"

01:04.010 --> 01:06.240
you know, like,ice cream sundae.

01:06.390 --> 01:07.710
This makes me sickto my stomach, lemon.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.280
Don geiss is my hero,my
mentor, a great man.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.040
Holding up one fingerto get someone
to stop talking...He invented that.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.460
- I don't think...
- And now...

01:16.460 --> 01:19.230
He's being publicly
humiliatedby his own family.

01:19.230 --> 01:23.280
This is y I'm gladI never had
children,and why I never will.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.510
Oh, jack,you don't mean that.

01:24.510 --> 01:27.640
Geiss also invented the
abruptconversational segue.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.660
Talk aboutyour thing now.

01:29.660 --> 01:32.080
Okay, well, um,my
building is going condo.

01:32.080 --> 01:35.330
And they're tryingto drive the renters
out?Are you going tobuy your place?

01:35.330 --> 01:37.130
Well, I love my builng,but
if I gonna buy a place

01:37.130 --> 01:39.830
it should be a big placewhere
I can have a family.

01:39.830 --> 01:43.010
Then spend someof your dealbreakers
money.Buy two apartments.

01:43.010 --> 01:45.520
-What?
-You know whymy place is so big?

01:45.680 --> 01:47.770
When I was first married to
myexwife we were in the basement.

01:47.770 --> 01:49.780
Over the years I keptbuying
the floors above me

01:49.900 --> 01:51.470
to make room for the
familyI thought we'd have.

01:51.550 --> 01:53.920
Well, now I havesomething
better than a family.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.080
A walkin humidor,a lap pool,

01:56.080 --> 01:59.060
and a replica of the irish
pubwhere my grandmother was born.

01:59.150 --> 02:00.290
Well, I'm not rich, jack.

02:00.290 --> 02:02.910
You're doing okay.And this
could beyour dream apartment.

02:02.910 --> 02:05.680
Sniff around yourupstairs
neighbor,see if he'sanning to leave.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.520
If he's not, make him an offerhe
can't refuse.Trademark 1974,

02:10.370 --> 02:12.300
-don geiss.
-What, like, bribe him?

02:12.300 --> 02:15.540
I know thissounds ugly,but with
manhattan real estatethere are no rules.

02:15.540 --> 02:18.290
It's like checkinat an italian airport.

Oh, my god! Frank!

02:47.490 --> 02:49.220
Were you gonna peein that jar?

02:49.330 --> 02:50.550
I didn't knowanyone was here.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.420
That's what youuse the jars for?

02:53.520 --> 02:55.450
You told methat was sun tea.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.420
Some of themare sun tea,

02:58.510 --> 03:01.870
and some of themwere sun tea.

03:03.140 --> 03:04.800
Do you know about this?

03:04.920 --> 03:06.700
We havea gentleman's agreement.

03:06.780 --> 03:10.130
He gets the jars,and
in return he's agreed

03:10.190 --> 03:13.320
to let a yale sweatshirtbe
our desd fart dampener.

03:13.390 --> 03:15.170
What is wrongwith you guys?

03:15.250 --> 03:18.570
What would it be like if
cerieand sue and I were not here?

03:18.650 --> 03:21.140
-We'd have a room dognamed meatus.
-I'd take my pants offand eat chicken wings.

03:21.250 --> 03:25.710
Shut it down.Throw away the jars.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.600
Fine, but I'mgonna recycle them,

03:27.600 --> 03:32.280
and then one day as youdrink some apple
juice,you'll wonder,"where has this jar been?"

03:32.280 --> 03:35.460
I will fight my sister toothand
nail to get what I deserve

03:35.710 --> 03:40.380
because i, bertram geiss,am
still daddy's fancy boy.

03:40.460 --> 03:44.170
After the deposition,kathy geiss's
lawyeroffered this rebuttal.

03:44.230 --> 03:49.380
My name is teddy ruxpin.Can
you and I be friends?

03:50.190 --> 03:51.550
Mr. Donaghy,you wanted to see me?

03:51.650 --> 03:52.950
Kenneth,I have a task for you.

03:53.060 --> 03:53.700
Is it menial?

03:53.780 --> 03:58.510
As part of nbc's annualgreen week
initiative,has to reduceits carbon footprint.

03:58.610 --> 04:00.860
I'm putting youin charge that effort.

04:00.930 --> 04:02.810
Global warming, sir?

04:02.870 --> 04:05.940
I'm sorry, that's justa
bunch of scientist talk.

04:06.040 --> 04:09.500
Same peoplewho'd have you believe
that my greatgrandfatherwas a monkey.

04:09.580 --> 04:12.760
If he was a monkey, then
whywas he killed by a monkey?

04:12.900 --> 04:14.870
You're preachingto the choir, kenneth.

04:14.970 --> 04:18.420
I mean, I love the earth.I
have these rarekadupul blossoms

04:18.510 --> 04:21.779
flown in every morningfrom
sri lanka on a private jet.

04:21.890 --> 04:25.350
That's the definitionof green.And
yet they force usto do more.

04:25.460 --> 04:28.140
More sacrifices.Why? For the children.

04:28.220 --> 04:30.030
What have childrenever done for us?

04:30.130 --> 04:32.670
Well, they makeour shoes and wallets.

04:32.740 --> 04:36.110
I need a 5% reductionof
energy use across the board.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.340
I'll do itif you insist, sir.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.720
But I'm gonna be grumpyuntil
the end this sentence.

05:01.290 --> 05:02.550
Wow, this placeis great.

05:03.080 --> 05:06.350
Isn't it?New kitchen,original molding,

05:06.400 --> 05:09.550

05:09.630 --> 05:14.390
So... You gonnatry and bribe me like
the rest of theseyuppie bottom feeders?

05:14.490 --> 05:16.980
What? No. Bribe?People do that?

05:17.060 --> 05:20.510
Yeah, well,the guy above me
offered me ten grandto move out.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.380
That's a lot.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.130
It's obscene.This
neighborhoodused to be real.

05:25.250 --> 05:28.480
Now it's all chain
storesand fancy restaurants.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.130
Yeah, we cool peoplegot
to hold our ground.

05:31.190 --> 05:34.970
Fight the man.Michael moore, et
cetera.Is thata working fireplace?

05:35.050 --> 05:38.020
Yeah, but it'skind of
annoying.I can't ut the flue,

05:38.130 --> 05:42.700
so the apartment smells likeburger
king all day and cinnabon all night.

05:44.290 --> 05:48.190
Yeah, I just came up hereto
make sure you're staying.

05:48.270 --> 05:54.070
Ruining things for those creepsg to make
duplexesfor their imaginary children,

05:54.180 --> 05:58.150
and their imaginary
husband,astronaut mike dexter.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.570
So what's your plan?

05:59.900 --> 06:03.350
I don't know. Just
figuresomething out, I guess.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.800
Look,what if we team up?

06:06.950 --> 06:09.110
-What do you mean?
-I can't affordto stay here on my own,

06:09.190 --> 06:12.970
and based on yourshoes and
teeth,i'm guessingyou can't either,

06:13.060 --> 06:15.130
so why don't wemove in together?

06:16.250 --> 06:19.290
I mean, you'd have togive up your
place'cause this isthe twobedroom.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.540
There's two of them?

06:20.640 --> 06:24.360
oh! Is that bad?Oh, god.

06:25.560 --> 06:28.070
So now you're your ownupstairs neighbor.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.510
What's the plan?

06:29.580 --> 06:33.320
Well, I'm gonna pretendto move in
with brian,somehow drive him out,

06:33.410 --> 06:36.360
then buy both placesand
make my dream apartment.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.070
That sounds like something
I'dcome up with if I was smarter.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.860
I know, I'm terrible.But brian sucks.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.640
He doesn't have a tv and
hewears political tshirts.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.960
Don't feel guiltyfor a second.This
is manhattanreal estate.

06:47.980 --> 06:51.090
There are no rules.Like
checkinat an italian sex party.

06:51.150 --> 06:53.060
I mean,do you know how long I've
been waitingfor the lady next door

06:53.060 --> 06:55.180
to finally joinher husband in hell?

06:55.180 --> 06:56.350
Hello, Mrs. Gerstein.

06:56.520 --> 07:02.200
Oh, my heart...Is
getting strongerevery day.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.850
Oh, you ancient bitch!

07:04.940 --> 07:06.630
But you've alreadygot
a foot in the door.

07:06.730 --> 07:07.810
Here's whatyou're gonna do.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.160
Do you rememberthat horrible
roommate you had back in chicago?

07:10.230 --> 07:10.960
You mean you?

07:11.470 --> 07:14.440
I know it's my turnto do the
dishes,but I'm in character,

07:14.440 --> 07:19.670
and if you make me do the
dishesI will kill myself!

07:19.670 --> 07:21.900
You drove a lot of guysout
of that third bedroom.

07:21.980 --> 07:26.900
Becauseguys hate drama.And I'm gonna
teach youhow to be a drama queen.

07:26.970 --> 07:32.800
And if I fail,i'm gonna take a bunch
of pills,and it's gonna be your fault!

07:32.860 --> 07:34.460
Still got it.

07:38.030 --> 07:41.380
Lemon, I justwant to make sure you're not
making any jokesabout don geiss this week.

07:41.380 --> 07:46.900
Don't worry,ack.Our topicalcold open is
aboutomarosa borrowingbjork's swan dress.

07:48.390 --> 07:49.190
Tracy.

07:49.270 --> 07:50.200
What's up, donaghy?

07:50.290 --> 07:53.260
Tracy jr.,to what do we owe this visit?

07:53.350 --> 07:55.330
It's "take your black kidto work day."

07:56.950 --> 07:58.940
Do you everregret having children?

07:59.020 --> 08:00.550
Every day.

08:00.650 --> 08:03.420
I thought having a family
wasgonna be like the cosby show.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.310
Oh, no,vanessa nto a concert!

08:05.440 --> 08:09.030
Oh, no, rudy and I are makinga
sandwich for 25 minutes!

08:09.140 --> 08:12.810
The cosby show was a lie.Having
a familycan be the worst.

08:12.910 --> 08:17.580
For example,I have this strip club story
from this weekendI need to tell you, jackie d.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.830
It is disgusting.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.620
But I can't becauseI got
this little dbag, here.

08:22.700 --> 08:23.640
I know what that means.

08:23.740 --> 08:25.160
And yet youwon't tell me.

08:25.240 --> 08:28.320
I've been thinkinga lot about
family lately, about my legacy.

08:28.390 --> 08:32.100
I've been watching a friendgo through an
ordealwith his children,and it has only affirmed

08:32.190 --> 08:35.280
that I was not meantto have any
of my ownand that I never will.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.730
It's not that simple.

08:36.820 --> 08:40.490
Now, what if a girltries to trap you like
nicole tried to do meon the band trip?

08:40.580 --> 08:42.990
Bitches can be tricky.

08:43.070 --> 08:45.120
I'm going to getsome strawberry milk.

08:45.160 --> 08:49.660
Tracy jr.'s right.There's only one way
to reallytake children off the table.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.440
I'm going to geta vasectomy.

08:52.940 --> 08:55.090
.I mean, that's a bigecision!

08:55.170 --> 08:58.110
Having a family is alsothe
best thing a man could...

08:58.720 --> 09:00.410
He's gone.So my story.

09:00.530 --> 09:03.050
So I'm in the strip club with
charles barkleyand one of the hobbits.

09:03.140 --> 09:03.730
Hey, daddy.

09:03.780 --> 09:08.650
Damn it!I n't live like
this!I'm gettinga vasectomy too!

09:09.290 --> 09:10.370
Excuse me, Miss maroney.

09:10.460 --> 09:13.010
Kenneth, I'm doingy
kegelsright now. What is it?

09:13.110 --> 09:16.460
Well, I've beenput in charge of
reducing tgs's carbon footprint.

09:16.570 --> 09:17.710
And everyonehas to chip in.

09:17.830 --> 09:20.600
Kenneth, I oncetook a lowvolume
shower with ed begley jr.

09:20.700 --> 09:21.780
What more can I do?

09:21.850 --> 09:23.350
Well, let's see.

09:23.460 --> 09:26.520
Minka kelly says,"my
show is about football.

09:26.630 --> 09:29.700
"there's a football teamcalled
the chargers.Unplug your chargers."

09:29.810 --> 09:31.450
But kenneth,I need all of these.

09:31.530 --> 09:34.190
This one's for my cell
phone,this one's for my laptop,

09:34.310 --> 09:39.390
this one'sfor my erotic massager,and
this one'sfor something personal.

09:42.820 --> 09:45.470
A vasectomy is a veryserious decision.

09:45.580 --> 09:47.360
I want to make sure
you'veboth tught this through.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.510
I have,I've thought about it,and I've
decided thatI don't want to have children.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.420
Family planning.And
what about you, tracy?

09:53.510 --> 09:55.850
the cosby showlied to me.

09:55.950 --> 09:58.360
I don't think there'sa
box for that on the form.

09:58.430 --> 10:01.240
Uh, what about"cheers lied to me"?

10:01.350 --> 10:06.030
Okay.Now, for the procedureyou can
choose between localor general anesthesia.

10:06.130 --> 10:09.850
I should warn youthat general anesthesia
can cause powerfulhallucinations.

10:09.930 --> 10:14.120
So highly recommend it.I'll
scheduleboth of you for the morning.

10:14.220 --> 10:17.070
Now, this is surgery, so don'teat
anything before you come in,

10:17.140 --> 10:20.880
because I'll havea big
breakfast waiting for you.

10:21.780 --> 10:22.900
Until tomorrow,gentlemen.

10:23.740 --> 10:27.140
We all see the little, black
boyin the corner, right?

10:28.420 --> 10:29.630
Okay.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.080
Hey, liz.

10:34.210 --> 10:35.950
Made you a mailbox key.

10:36.060 --> 10:39.720
So is thatall you have to say
to me?That's how you apologize?

10:39.790 --> 10:41.000
What? What did I do?

10:41.120 --> 10:43.790
What do you care?Whatever,
brian, I am over it!

10:43.890 --> 10:45.730
-Over what?
- It!

10:45.910 --> 10:48.450
Oh, I'm sorry,is it too much drama?

10:48.550 --> 10:52.010
You remind me of my
fatherand my boyfriend!

10:52.130 --> 10:55.030
Ugh! Are you listening to
me?Because if you are not,

10:55.030 --> 10:58.340
I will put on a wedding dressand
jump in front of a subway!

10:58.340 --> 11:02.670
Honey, you don't needto
tell me how much men suck.

11:02.780 --> 11:05.970
Sit downand tell me everythingwhile
I make usraspberry mojitos.

11:06.040 --> 11:06.860
You're gay?

11:06.930 --> 11:10.420

Hi, tracy.I thought "take your
black kidto work day" was yesterday.

11:21.550 --> 11:24.010
No, it's alwaysa wednesday.

11:25.060 --> 11:28.280
Brian is gay, jenna.The drama
did notmake him want to move out.

11:28.390 --> 11:30.820
Well, of course not.Drama
is likegay man gatorade.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.530
It replenishestheir electrolytes.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.570
Damn it,he's never gonna leave.

11:34.660 --> 11:36.380
Trying to getsomeone to move out?

11:36.470 --> 11:39.010
May I suggest what gotmy
neighbors to move out?

11:39.070 --> 11:41.250
Black person moved in,scared 'em off.

11:41.330 --> 11:43.360
Huh. That's nota bad idea, tracy.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.220
I got a lotof good ideas.Now
if you'll excuse me,

11:46.330 --> 11:50.210
I have to take my sonto my
vasectomybecause the cosby showlied to me

11:50.280 --> 11:54.410
and I cannot tellan
amazing strip club story.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.540
Okay, let's go.

11:59.930 --> 12:03.850
Miss lemon.As I'm sure you
know,it is green week, and nbc...

12:03.850 --> 12:06.010
Oh, brother, are they actuallygonna
do something this year,

12:06.060 --> 12:10.730
or are they just gonna putthat stupid
green peacock in the cornerof the screen?

12:11.400 --> 12:14.160
Actually, we're reducing
tgs's carbon footprint.

12:14.220 --> 12:18.400
And what you can do,miss lemon,is
get rid of youroffice mini fridge.

12:18.490 --> 12:22.720
My mini fridge?What about my fresh
fruit?...flavored toastercheesecakes?

12:22.810 --> 12:25.230
Oh, so I guess you canmake
other peopl stuff up,

12:25.300 --> 12:28.230
but you're too goodto
make a sacrifice yourself.

12:28.320 --> 12:33.630
Fine, I'll give upmy mini fridge because
unlike frankI am a good d decent person.

12:33.710 --> 12:35.610
Is that my cell phone?

12:35.690 --> 12:39.540
Oh, no, sorry.It's in my hand.

12:40.810 --> 12:42.190
Count backwardsfrom ten.

12:42.300 --> 12:43.630
Sure.I know how to do that.

12:43.820 --> 12:48.320
You lied to me, bill
cosby!You lied to me!

12:48.390 --> 12:51.910
Uhoh, here comesmy hallucination.

12:57.980 --> 13:03.300
Denise. Vanessa?Sondra the
boring one.'s your father.

13:03.410 --> 13:07.590
I'm having a cosby show hallucination.

13:07.700 --> 13:08.450
Hey, dad.

13:08.530 --> 13:10.680
Theo,what's going on here?

13:10.760 --> 13:12.950
Did rudy make a messwith
the juicer again?

13:13.030 --> 13:17.190
Vanessa was supposed tobe watching her
and not upstairsgossiping on the phone.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.490
Who are rudyand vanessa?

13:18.550 --> 13:21.060
Your adorable sisterand your sister.

13:21.140 --> 13:24.570
I don't have any sisters, dad.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.620
it's just us guys.

13:26.710 --> 13:29.430
You know how it iswhen
it's just us guys, right?

13:30.860 --> 13:33.400
That's why my lifeis
not like the cosby show.

13:33.520 --> 13:37.560
I only have boys,and
boys are disgusting!

13:37.630 --> 13:39.710
I need a baby girl.

13:39.930 --> 13:41.740
Don't patronize me!

13:41.820 --> 13:44.410
Stop laughing!It's not funny!

13:44.510 --> 13:48.910
I need a baby girl!Don't
snip my vas deferens!

13:50.170 --> 13:52.520
Looking... Things!

13:52.600 --> 13:54.180
Hey, what'reyou doing home?

13:54.260 --> 13:59.010
Oh, just gettingmy computer.Sorry,
I forgot you'dbe home now, brian!

14:00.130 --> 14:02.230
Elizabeth,I know you're in there.

14:02.310 --> 14:06.870
Oh, no.It's my crazy black
boyfriend,astronaut mike dexter.

14:06.870 --> 14:10.160
Better not be with a
man!Even if he's gay!

14:10.160 --> 14:12.890
Mike, no, I don't evenknow
why I'm letting you in

14:12.890 --> 14:15.100
when you're in thisunreasonable state.

14:15.190 --> 14:16.660
Don't get angryand jealous,

14:16.710 --> 14:19.550
even though brian is the
onewho convinced me to move on.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.660
I'm gonna be coming byall the time,

14:21.750 --> 14:24.720
gettin' jealous,takin'
thingout of context.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.580
That dude brianwould
be happier moving out!

14:27.700 --> 14:29.210
Okay, everybodyjust calm down.

14:29.330 --> 14:31.220
I feel angry!

14:31.330 --> 14:34.860
Like warren moonmust've
felt back in 1995!

14:34.920 --> 14:38.140
As I have told you many
timesduring our relationship,

14:38.220 --> 14:40.600
no one getsthat reference.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.600
Oh, lord!

14:42.710 --> 14:44.310
Nypd!Stay on the ground!

14:44.410 --> 14:50.060
A gay hipster cop.You're
aninteresting guy, brian.

14:52.340 --> 14:53.400
Look at this.

14:53.490 --> 14:56.660
The geiss name used to
besynonymous with success, power,

14:56.740 --> 14:59.160
funny incidentswhere
women died at barbecues.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.670
Now it's beingdragged through the mud.

15:01.750 --> 15:04.500
This is whyi'm having a vasectomy.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.740
Yeah, but lookat that picture.

15:06.860 --> 15:09.090
He had some good timeswith his kids too.

15:09.170 --> 15:11.810
That junk is priceless.

15:11.900 --> 15:16.090
Well, I'm glad I'm doing
this.Very, very glad.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.590
What are youworking on now?

15:18.690 --> 15:21.310
I have to write an
essayabout my dad for school.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.550
I wanted the cover to
beone of those things

15:23.550 --> 15:26.360
where each letter in his
namestands for a word about him.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.230
That's calledan "acrostic."

15:28.360 --> 15:32.490
An acrostic. Cool.Thanks
for teaching me that.

15:33.430 --> 15:35.120
Yes, well,you're welcome.

15:36.950 --> 15:41.630
Maybe I could help youwith the
grammar.Why don't youread it to me?

15:42.700 --> 15:45.990
"T" is for terrific,"r" is for rad,

15:46.090 --> 15:51.320
"a" is for awesome,"c"...
'cause he's my dad.

15:51.980 --> 15:54.950
Damn you, tracy jr.

15:57.850 --> 16:01.060
Miss lemon, your mini
fridgeis still in your office.

16:01.170 --> 16:03.640
You made a promiseto masi oka.

16:03.750 --> 16:08.080
"conserve electricity.Don't
be a zero,be a good guy."

16:08.420 --> 16:10.190
Why doesn't thatsay "hero"?

16:10.360 --> 16:11.850
That feels likea real
missed opportunity.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.280
I don't care.If I can't
havemy adult apartment,

16:14.360 --> 16:16.830
I will havemy mini fridge.

16:16.960 --> 16:20.410
Wow, liz.Don't you
careabout the environment?

16:20.520 --> 16:22.560
Shut up. What do you
knowabout the environment?

16:22.660 --> 16:24.980
Only everything.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.150
Ladies and gentlemen,I present to you

16:28.280 --> 16:33.490
the greenest person at
tgs,mr. Frank rossitano.

16:35.640 --> 16:39.420
He neverwastes anything.I've
seen himeat food from the trash.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.950
What's a trash barrel but a
big salad bowlfilled with trash?

16:43.060 --> 16:45.150
He never wastes waterby
doing his laundry.

16:45.230 --> 16:47.040
This shirtstarted out white.

16:47.130 --> 16:48.660
No, do not encourage this.

16:48.740 --> 16:53.070
He pees in jars and leaves themaround
the office.That's a health hazard.

16:53.150 --> 16:55.590
Come.Let me show you something.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.620
Don't talk to melike that.You look
like a turtlewho lost its shell.

16:58.740 --> 17:03.040
Mr. Rossitanohas actually been
emptying his jarsout there.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.390
He's been pouring themout the window?

17:05.599 --> 17:07.150
Oh, that is...

17:07.780 --> 17:09.910
Beautiful.

17:10.010 --> 17:14.240
Miss lemon,tgs can reach its
5% goalin one of two ways.

17:14.329 --> 17:16.430
You can give upyour mini fridge,

17:16.530 --> 17:20.930
or you can let Mr.
Rossitanodo his sun tea system.

17:22.470 --> 17:24.160
Just keepthe door closed.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.000
Absolutely not.

17:28.750 --> 17:31.400
Wake up, tracy!Wake up!

17:32.720 --> 17:35.080
I don't want a vasectomy,dr. Spaceman.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.070
I need to goback in time.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.410
Why did I sellmy delorean to Mr. T?

17:39.490 --> 17:41.220
You'll be fine, tracy.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.620
I didn't let leogo
through with the vasectomy.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.860
If a patient's friendruns
into the operating room

17:45.940 --> 17:48.970
and yells at you,you have to
stop.It's the doctor's code.

17:49.050 --> 17:50.740
Jackie d,I need a baby girl!

17:50.800 --> 17:53.260
Maybe one day our
kidswill play together.

17:53.380 --> 17:54.930
I didn't havemy vastomy either.

17:55.020 --> 17:59.930
Tracy, I wantto have children.I want
those memories,no matter what t cost.

18:00.010 --> 18:01.660
And I have to pass onthis head of hair.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.960
What made youchange your mind?

18:03.050 --> 18:05.090
Tracy jr. Made youan acrostic.

18:05.190 --> 18:09.490
Well, I hope he makes mean across
helmet so I don't get hurtplaying across!

18:09.570 --> 18:11.140
Now, come on,that's
pretty solidfor a guy

18:11.220 --> 18:14.300
who just cameout of an hallucination.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.090
Hey, how'd everything gowith dotcom?

18:17.200 --> 18:18.490
Terrible, actually.

18:18.570 --> 18:19.510
Well, what're yougonna do now?

18:19.610 --> 18:20.360
I give up.

18:20.480 --> 18:24.270
I can't jack, jenna, or tracythis
guy out of the apartment.

18:24.340 --> 18:27.250
I'm out of... Ideas.

18:48.570 --> 18:49.820
I got the apartment!

18:49.910 --> 18:51.480
You did? How?

18:51.570 --> 18:53.550
He moved out,and now it's mine.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.230
You didn't reallyanswer my question.

18:55.340 --> 18:56.350
What?

18:56.460 --> 18:57.800
What did you do?

18:59.070 --> 19:00.710
You didn't!

19:00.790 --> 19:02.670
Manhattan real estate.No rules, right?

19:02.770 --> 19:04.300
You thinki'm disgusting?

19:04.350 --> 19:07.260
I used the sun tea systemto
stop global warming.

19:07.310 --> 19:10.220
You used it to kick a gay
copout of his apartment.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.210
I have no regrets!

19:14.170 --> 19:16.010
No regrets!

19:17.210 --> 19:18.560
Hey, tracy.

19:18.650 --> 19:21.320
Now you can tell meyour
filthy strip club story.

19:21.420 --> 19:24.550
Frank, I'm gonnahave a daughter,and
I would nevertell that story.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.470
It's demeaning to women.

19:26.540 --> 19:32.040
Especially if they've had
theirboobies sneezed on by a tiger.

19:37.730 --> 19:39.100
Good for you, sir.

19:39.180 --> 19:42.710
Did you knowthat fluorescent light bulbs
last ten times longerthan regular ones?

19:42.820 --> 19:45.760
Yup. And they only useone
quarter of the power.

19:45.830 --> 19:47.850
But if we're gonnasolve
the climate crisis,

19:47.930 --> 19:50.280
we've got to change more thanthe
light bulbs and the windows.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.970
We've got to changethe
laws and the policies

19:53.030 --> 19:56.570
through collective
politicalaction on a large scale.

19:56.580 --> 19:59.400
You know, there's an oldafrican
proverb that I made up.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.350
If you want to go quickly,go alone.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.030
If you want to go far,go together.

20:05.170 --> 20:08.220
We need to go far.Quickly.

20:08.330 --> 20:09.860
Mr. Vice president.

20:10.760 --> 20:13.390
The snack tableisn't gonna clean itself.

20:13.490 --> 20:15.060
Look again, kenneth.

20:16.730 --> 20:19.210
Well, that's notsuper helpful.

20:19.290 --> 20:22.120
Kenneth, encourageyour
lawmakers to take action,

20:22.210 --> 20:24.270
and recycle everything.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.860
Including jokes.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.260
I'm sorry, sir, what?

20:27.350 --> 20:29.070
Quiet.

20:30.070 --> 20:33.540
A whale is in trouble.I have to go.

20:40.220 --> 20:44.050
Sir, I'm happy to report that
TGS reduced its carbon footprint

20:44.110 --> 20:45.510
by seven percent.

20:45.580 --> 20:47.940
Kenneth, I also wanna do my part.

20:48.050 --> 20:50.620
You do? I may not have
children anytime soon.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.630
But when I do, I want the earth here.

20:52.690 --> 20:56.580
That's why I replaced my
wasteful imported flowers with

20:56.700 --> 21:01.030
beautiful azaleas from my
very own 30 rock terrace.

21:01.120 --> 21:05.080
Oh my They're still sprinkled with
morning due, Kenneth. Smell them.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.430
Smell my flowers, Kenneth.
