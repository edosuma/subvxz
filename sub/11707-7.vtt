They don't give a **
if run over.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.458
{\an7}I feel like Italy
shouldn't even have cars

36:50.541 --> 36:52.627
{\an7}'cause first off, nobody knows
how to *** drive here.

36:52.710 --> 36:55.630
{\an1}I was always scared to drive
in the city. Now? Yeah, right.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.757
{\an1}Now you can
frickin' take people out.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.133
{\an8}Yeah, I'll kill taxis.

36:59.216 --> 37:00.593
{\an8}It's just, like, chaos.

37:00.676 --> 37:02.762
{\an7}<i>It's like, people</i>
<i>are walking in the streets.</i>

37:02.845 --> 37:05.181
{\an7}You have to drive
in New York city times ten.

37:05.264 --> 37:06.807
{\an8}I'm just gonna use my hands.

37:06.891 --> 37:10.019
{\an7}Clearly nobody else, like,
looks at *** blinkers.

37:10.436 --> 37:11.646
{\an1}Go. Move.

37:13.731 --> 37:16.108
{\an1}God, these *** people
are *** insane.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.152
- *** you.
- Wait one second.

37:18.235 --> 37:19.362
They don't look.
They just go.

37:21.781 --> 37:22.949
{\an1}Whoa!

37:24.283 --> 37:25.409
{\an3}Oh, my God.

37:27.203 --> 37:27.912
{\an1}Slow down.

37:27.995 --> 37:30.206
- Oh, my God!
- Aah!

37:32.124 --> 37:34.543
- 'We hit the cop.'
- *** me!

37:36.671 --> 37:38.923
These *** people
are *** insane.

37:39.006 --> 37:39.882
[honking]

37:39.966 --> 37:42.927
[gasps]
Oh, my God!

37:44.095 --> 37:47.932
- *** me!
- 'We hit the cop.'

37:48.015 --> 37:49.517
{\an1}Oh, my God,
are we gonna get in trouble?

37:49.600 --> 37:52.520
Probably! What the ***?

37:52.603 --> 37:55.022
*** up my life!

37:55.106 --> 37:56.190
[sighs]

37:56.273 --> 37:59.777
- Hi, sir.
- Driving license.

37:59.860 --> 38:02.238
{\an1}- I know. It's in my...
- Car documents, and insurance.

38:02.321 --> 38:05.074
{\an1}It's not with me.
I have to go home to get it.

38:05.157 --> 38:06.492
[speaking in Italian]

38:06.575 --> 38:07.702
So how does this work here?

38:07.785 --> 38:09.453
{\an1}Do you get arrested
if you don't have a license?

38:09.537 --> 38:11.789
I don't *** know.

38:11.872 --> 38:12.832
{\an8}<i>(Snooki)</i>
<i>I'm just scared that</i>

38:12.915 --> 38:14.458
{\an8}<i>I'm gonna go to jail again.</i>

38:14.542 --> 38:15.793
{\an7}<i>I can't call the boys right</i>
<i>now, because I'll start crying.</i>

38:15.876 --> 38:18.879
{\an1}<i>I need Deena to call them,</i>
<i>ask them, you know</i>

38:18.963 --> 38:21.382
{\an7}"You need to bring, you know,
Nicole's license here

38:21.465 --> 38:23.384
{\an7}or she's gonna get
taken away by the cops."

38:23.467 --> 38:25.177
[telephone ringing]

38:25.261 --> 38:26.554
- Hello?
- 'Vin? It's Deena.'

38:26.637 --> 38:29.682
{\an1}- What do you want?
- 'We got into a car accident.'

38:29.765 --> 38:31.058
'Me and Nicole,
we hit the cop.'

38:31.142 --> 38:33.894
But Nicole needs her license.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.856
{\an1}'Look for Nicole's purse.
It's black.'

38:36.939 --> 38:37.773
{\an1}'Alright,
what street are you on?'

38:37.857 --> 38:39.525
{\an7}It was very,
very serious, you know.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.027
{\an8}We're running out
the door right now.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.361
I got it, I got it.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.321
{\an7}<i>We don't know the magnitude</i>
<i>of the situation</i>

38:44.405 --> 38:45.990
{\an8}<i>but we know we gotta</i>
<i>get there quick.</i>

38:46.073 --> 38:47.867
{\an1}- Where did she say she was?
- Just some weird street.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.326
Filippo Strozzi.

38:49.410 --> 38:52.371
*** my life.
I can't breathe.

38:54.749 --> 38:57.293
Ugh. I'm gonna
get *** right now.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.337
Go. Go. Come on!

39:00.421 --> 39:02.798

'They're getting
out stretchers?'

39:02.882 --> 39:04.800
{\an7}Really?

39:04.884 --> 39:06.677
Shut up!

39:08.262 --> 39:09.180

'He's putting a neck brace on.'

39:09.263 --> 39:12.516

'I feel sick.'

39:12.600 --> 39:14.101
{\an1}- 'Come on!'
- 'Yo, we gotta get there fast.'

39:14.185 --> 39:15.478
'We gotta get there right now.'

'I'm ***. I'm not kidding.'

39:22.443 --> 39:24.153
Like, give me a break.

39:25.488 --> 39:26.530
[machine beeping]

39:28.616 --> 39:31.452
{\an1}- Okay.
- Oh, ***, I'm dizzy.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.746
{\an7}- What are they doing now?
- Let's go.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.791
{\an8}Don't do this.

39:36.874 --> 39:38.667
{\an8}- Please!
- Let's go.

39:38.751 --> 39:40.294
{\an8}No!

39:40.377 --> 39:43.964
{\an7}I don't wanna go in the back
off a cop car ever again.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.633
{\an8}Please!

39:51.388 --> 39:52.431
{\an7}Please,
I don't wanna go there.

39:54.683 --> 39:55.559
