WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:04.500
- HI!
- HELLO, SWEETIE.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.633
THERE'S
YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT,

00:05.633 --> 00:08.667
BUT YOU CAN'T OPEN IT
TILL TOMORROW.

00:08.667 --> 00:11.033
- WELCOME,
MOM- AND DAD-IN-LAW.

00:11.033 --> 00:13.267
- [low-key]
HELLO, ROBERT.

00:13.267 --> 00:16.467
[joyously]
HELLO, RAYMOND!

00:16.467 --> 00:17.767
- HEY.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.667
HOW YA DOIN'?

00:19.667 --> 00:21.367
- PAT, I REMEMBER
HOW MUCH FUN

00:21.367 --> 00:23.900
YOU AND RAYMOND HAD
DOING THAT PUZZLE LAST YEAR,

00:23.900 --> 00:25.300
SO I BOUGHT ONE.

00:25.300 --> 00:29.233
"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS."

00:29.233 --> 00:31.000
ALL OF WHICH I LOVE,
BY THE WAY,

00:31.000 --> 00:33.800
NOT A STINKER AMONG 'EM.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.100
- ACTUALLY, WE'VE ALREADY DONE
THAT PUZZLE.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.700
- DAMN!

00:39.367 --> 00:43.133
- GUESS I GOTTA WORK
ON THIS ONE RIGHT HERE.

00:45.733 --> 00:48.900
- SO, MOM, DAD, YOU GUYS'LL BE
SLEEPING IN OUR ROOM TONIGHT.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.967
- YES, I THINK YOU'LL BE
VERY COMFORTABLE IN OUR ROOM.

00:50.967 --> 00:54.567
WE HAVE A GREAT BED.
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA ENJOY IT.

00:56.967 --> 00:59.433
NOT...ENJOY ENJOY.

00:59.433 --> 01:03.167
SLEEP.
ENJOYABLE SLEEP.

01:03.167 --> 01:06.000
'CAUSE THAT'S ALL
YOU'LL BE DOING, I'M SURE.

01:07.867 --> 01:10.167
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY
YOU CAN'T DO WHAT YOU WANT,

01:10.167 --> 01:12.000
'CAUSE YOU CAN.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.067
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'LL BE
BREAKING ANY COMMANDMENTS.

01:20.333 --> 01:23.667
- IT'S LIKE YOUR MOUTH
IS FALLING DOWN THE STAIRS.

01:31.033 --> 01:33.267
- "ENJOY OUR BED."

01:33.267 --> 01:35.300
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

01:41.533 --> 01:44.500
OH, HI.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.933
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT?

01:47.933 --> 01:50.033
WHAT, CAN'T SLEEP?

01:50.033 --> 01:52.100
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

02:05.433 --> 02:10.667
- YOUR MOM'S CACCIATORE
WAS VERY SPICY.

02:10.667 --> 02:13.300
- WOW!

02:13.300 --> 02:16.433
- OH, ROBERT, PLEASE DON'T
TELL ANYONE I SMOKE.

02:16.433 --> 02:18.967
- N-N-NO, NO, I WON'T.

02:18.967 --> 02:21.833
- IT'S MY DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.

02:21.833 --> 02:24.300
I DON'T SMOKE A LOT,
JUST THREE A DAY.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.100
I'VE TRIED TO QUIT,
BUT THEY'RE JUST SO--

02:27.100 --> 02:28.333
- ADDICTIVE.

02:28.333 --> 02:32.267
- I WAS GONNA SAY
WONDERFULLY RELAXING.

02:34.133 --> 02:36.133
- THAT TOO.
YEAH.

02:36.133 --> 02:38.600
SO NO ONE KNOWS?
NOT HANK?

02:38.600 --> 02:40.667
- OH, GOODNESS, NO.

02:40.667 --> 02:43.400
- NOT EVEN...RAYMOND?

02:43.400 --> 02:44.533
- NO.

02:47.733 --> 02:49.333
- SO IF YOU DON'T
MIND ME ASKING,

02:49.333 --> 02:51.867
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
TO KEEP IT HIDDEN?

02:51.867 --> 02:53.267
- IT'S NOT EASY.

02:53.267 --> 02:55.300
I BUY MY CIGARETTES
TWO COUNTIES OVER

02:55.300 --> 02:57.600
WHERE NO ONE KNOWS ME.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.100
- BUT YOU NEVER
SMELL LIKE SMOKE.

03:00.100 --> 03:03.367
- I ONLY SMOKE OUTSIDE,
I HOLD IT DOWNWIND,

03:03.367 --> 03:07.533
AND I ALWAYS HAVE
PLENTY OF MINTY CHEWING GUM.

03:07.533 --> 03:12.267
IN FACT, HANK THINKS
GUM-CHEWING IS MY BAD HABIT.

03:12.267 --> 03:14.833
- INTERESTING.

03:14.833 --> 03:19.133
- I APPRECIATE YOU BEIN'
SO UNDERSTANDING, ROBERT.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.667
- OH, SURE.
OF--OF COURSE.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.467
- I'VE KEPT IT HIDDEN SO LONG,
IT'S KIND OF NICE

03:31.467 --> 03:36.100
TO LET SOMEONE IN
ON THE SECRET.

03:36.100 --> 03:38.100
- WELL, I'M...

03:38.100 --> 03:40.767
GLAD I CAN...

03:40.767 --> 03:42.133
BE THAT SOMEONE.

03:42.133 --> 03:45.100
- ME TOO.

03:53.367 --> 03:58.000
- SO YOU...MIND
IF I BUM A CIGGY?

03:59.500 --> 04:02.333
- YOU WANT A CIGARETTE?
BUT YOU DON'T SMOKE.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.700
- OH, SURE, YOU KNOW,

04:03.700 --> 04:06.300
AS A COP, IT HELPS
TO HAVE A SMOKE EVERY SO OFTEN.

04:06.300 --> 04:07.433
'CAUSE I GOTTA TELL YOU,

04:07.433 --> 04:09.367
I SEE A LOT OF SICK THINGS
EVERY DAY.

04:09.367 --> 04:13.033
YOU KNOW, I ONCE FOUND
A FOOT IN A MAILBOX.

04:13.033 --> 04:14.600
- OH, MY.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.300
- OH, YEAH,
LUCKILY, WE CAUGHT THE GUY

04:16.300 --> 04:19.867
'CAUSE THERE WAS
A RETURN ADDRESS.

04:19.867 --> 04:23.000
IT'S A COP JOKE.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.567
- HERE YOU ARE.

04:24.567 --> 04:25.700
- AH...

04:25.700 --> 04:29.133
AH, GREAT, YEAH,
THIS WILL HIT THE SPOT.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.367
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY NOW?

04:41.367 --> 04:44.200
- I'M FINE.
FINE.

04:44.200 --> 04:48.033
LISTEN, I--I'M SORRY
I LIED ABOUT ME SMOKING.

04:48.033 --> 04:49.167
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YA,

04:49.167 --> 04:51.033
I THINK I GOT
A LITTLE TASTE FOR IT TONIGHT,

04:51.033 --> 04:54.333
AND I JUST MIGHT
PICK IT UP.

04:54.333 --> 04:59.733
- ROBERT, I WANT YOU TO KNOW...

04:59.733 --> 05:03.200
I HAD A VERY NICE TIME
TALKING WITH YOU.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.467
- ME TOO.

05:05.467 --> 05:06.767
- OKAY.

05:08.633 --> 05:10.567
AW.

05:12.467 --> 05:13.767
GOOD NIGHT.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.133
- 'NIGHT.

05:21.933 --> 05:22.833
- HEY.

05:22.833 --> 05:26.167
OH, SORRY, I WAS JUST GETTING
A DRINK OF MILK.

05:36.267 --> 05:40.967
- WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

05:40.967 --> 05:42.967
- NOTHING.

05:42.967 --> 05:49.067
THIS IS JUST A DREAM.

05:49.067 --> 05:50.933
- WERE YOU SMOKING?

05:50.933 --> 05:55.667
- NO. SHH.
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.033
YOU'RE FLYING.

06:04.067 --> 06:07.633
- [sniffing]

06:07.633 --> 06:12.700
- WILL YA--WILL YA
STOP SMELLING ME?

06:12.700 --> 06:14.133
- WAIT!

06:15.600 --> 06:16.800
HEY!

06:16.800 --> 06:18.167
TELL ME THE TRUTH!

06:18.167 --> 06:19.600
DO YOU SMOKE?

06:19.600 --> 06:21.567
- SHH!
PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING,

06:21.567 --> 06:23.900
AND YOU'RE BEING
VERY INCONSIDERATE.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.233
- WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE?

06:26.233 --> 06:28.667
- YOU SEE WHAT YOU DID?
YOU WOKE UP AN OLD LADY.

06:32.067 --> 06:33.300
- ROBERT WAS SMOKING.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.600
- I WASN'T.
I WASN'T!

06:35.600 --> 06:36.433
- SMELL HIM.

06:36.433 --> 06:39.467
- COME HERE.
COME HERE.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.600
OH, MY GOD!

06:41.600 --> 06:44.000
- OW!

06:44.000 --> 06:47.033
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:47.033 --> 06:50.600
- SOMEBODY BETTER BE DEAD
OR DYING.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.833
- SMACK HIM, FRANK.

06:51.833 --> 06:53.467
- OW!

06:53.467 --> 06:55.133
- CAN I GO BACK
TO BED NOW?

06:55.133 --> 06:56.800
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT
HE'S BEEN DOING?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.233
SMELL HIM.

06:59.867 --> 07:02.033
NO, NOT THERE!

07:02.033 --> 07:04.833
HIS SHIRT!

07:04.833 --> 07:07.033
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT!

07:07.033 --> 07:08.667
- HE'S BEEN SMOKING!

07:10.833 --> 07:12.800
- ALL RIGHT!

07:12.800 --> 07:17.000
I DID IT JUST ONCE, OKAY?
JUST ONE TIME!

07:17.000 --> 07:18.100
- WHY?

07:18.100 --> 07:19.933
- ALL RIGHT,
THERE WAS...

07:19.933 --> 07:23.733
THIS NEW GUY AT WORK
WHO SMOKES, AND HE'S--

07:23.733 --> 07:27.033
AND HE'S REALLY POPULAR,
AND I JUST WANTED TO FIT IN.

07:31.333 --> 07:34.867
BUT I DIDN'T EVEN LIKE IT.
IT MADE ME THROW UP.

07:34.867 --> 07:37.200
- NO MORE LYING.
YOU'RE A SMOKER!

07:37.200 --> 07:39.400
- IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT?

07:39.400 --> 07:42.700
- EVERYTHING'S HORRIBLE!
ROBERT SMOKES!

07:42.700 --> 07:44.600
- NO!

07:44.600 --> 07:48.167
- DON'T YOU KNOW THAT SMOKING
CAN STUNT YOUR GROWTH?

07:52.233 --> 07:54.500
- YOU KNOW, I AM NOT ONLY
THE VICE PRINCIPAL

07:54.500 --> 07:58.600
AT COOPER JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL,
I AM ALSO THE HEALTH ED TEACHER.

07:58.600 --> 08:02.367
- GOOD.
TELL HIM HOW BAD SMOKING IS.

08:02.367 --> 08:04.933
- WHEN ANY FACULTY MEMBER
BRINGS ME A YOUNGSTER

08:04.933 --> 08:06.467
WHO THEY'VE CAUGHT SMOKING,

08:06.467 --> 08:07.933
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THE FIRST THING IS

08:07.933 --> 08:09.233
THAT I ASK THEM?

08:09.233 --> 08:12.633
"WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DRINK POISON?"

08:12.633 --> 08:15.567
WELL, MR. BARONE,
I'LL ASK YOU THE SAME THING.

08:15.567 --> 08:18.367
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DRINK POISON?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.300
- DO YOU HAVE ANY?

08:30.300 --> 08:33.267
- JOKES.
FUNNY BUSINESS.

08:33.267 --> 08:34.667
IT'S WHAT I GET
FROM MY 12-YEAR-OLDS,

08:34.667 --> 08:37.067
AND I GUESS IT'S WHAT
I'LL GET FROM YOU AS WELL.

08:37.067 --> 08:39.500
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS,
MOTHER?

08:39.500 --> 08:43.067
- WAIT.

08:43.067 --> 08:44.400
ROBERT...

08:49.067 --> 08:51.767
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.667
- HEY, PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON!

09:33.033 --> 09:34.500
- WHERE'S EVERYBODY ELSE,
ROBERT?

09:34.500 --> 09:35.833
- OH, THEY'LL BE OVER SOON.

09:35.833 --> 09:37.433
I JUST HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.

09:37.433 --> 09:39.267
MOM HASN'T HIT ME THIS HARD
SINCE I WAS TWELVE

09:39.267 --> 09:43.100
AND SHE FOUND ME USING HER BRA
AS A SLINGSHOT.

09:46.533 --> 09:48.800
- YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SMOKING?

09:48.800 --> 09:49.667
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:49.667 --> 09:50.967
- I MEAN, UGH.
IT'S SO GROSS.

09:50.967 --> 09:51.800
- OKAY.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.000
- WHAT DO YOU THINK,
IT MAKES YOU LOOK HIP,

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
THE SMOKING?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.300
- NO.

09:55.300 --> 09:58.267
- PROBABLY LOOKS LIKE
FRANKENSTEIN BLEW A FUSE.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.833
- I DON'T SMOKE, ALL RIGHT?

10:03.833 --> 10:05.133
I DID IT ONE TIME,

10:05.133 --> 10:06.600
AND IT WAS JUST
SO I COULD GET CLOSER TO--

10:07.500 --> 10:10.767
- WHO?
CLOSER TO WHO?

10:10.767 --> 10:12.600
- NO ONE.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.933
ALTHOUGH SHE DIDN'T EXACTLY
STICK UP FOR ME.

10:14.933 --> 10:17.700
- SHE?
WHO'S "SHE"?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.233
MARIE?
- NO.

10:19.233 --> 10:20.600
- AMY?
- NO.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.400
- NOT PAT.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.033
PAT?

10:24.033 --> 10:27.533
NO!

10:27.533 --> 10:28.833
- PAT SMOKES?

10:28.833 --> 10:30.800
- I CAUGHT HER OUTSIDE
LAST NIGHT, OKAY?

10:30.800 --> 10:32.600
BUT DON'T SAY ANYTHING!
NOBODY KNOWS.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.433
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
YOU WERE SMOKING WITH PAT,

10:35.433 --> 10:39.000
AND YOU GOT IN TROUBLE,
AND SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.500
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.900
- OHH, YOU'RE NOT THE SMOKER?

10:41.900 --> 10:45.100
I HAD SO MANY MORE NAMES
FOR YA.

10:45.100 --> 10:49.100
SMOKEY THE BEAR,
H.R. PUFNSTUF...

10:49.100 --> 10:51.067
TOWERING INFERNO!

10:54.233 --> 10:56.967
- OKAY, BIRTHDAY TIME.

10:56.967 --> 10:59.767
- AW, GREAT,
THEY'RE HERE.

10:59.767 --> 11:01.367
- HEY, ROBERT...

11:01.367 --> 11:03.767
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COOL.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.633
- HEY, PAT.

11:12.633 --> 11:15.633
THIS IS KINDA CRAZY
OVER THERE TODAY, HUH?

11:15.633 --> 11:18.100
- YES, BUT I THINK
IT'LL BLOW OVER SOON,

11:18.100 --> 11:20.033
AND THEN EVERYTHING
WILL BE FINE.

11:20.033 --> 11:21.767
- YEAH, I GUESS.

11:21.767 --> 11:23.967
IT'S TOO BAD ABOUT ROBERT,
THOUGH.

11:23.967 --> 11:25.567
HE'S SUCH A GOOD GUY.

11:25.567 --> 11:27.567
- YEAH, WELL, NOW IT'S NONE
OF OUR BUSINESS, THOUGH,

11:27.567 --> 11:33.433
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY...
NOT TALK.

11:33.433 --> 11:34.967
- I MEAN,
HE'S JUST SO SWEET,

11:34.967 --> 11:38.167
AND I KNOW HE WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO BE CLOSER TO YOUR FAMILY.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.367
- HE TOLD YOU I SMOKE,
DIDN'T HE?

11:43.367 --> 11:44.900
- WHAT?

11:44.900 --> 11:47.767
WHAT?
NO, NOOOO.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.567
- YOU'RE A GOOD ACTOR,
YOU'RE...

11:52.567 --> 11:56.033
SO BELIEVABLE.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.300
- I DON'T BLAME ROBERT.

12:03.300 --> 12:06.367
I PUT HIM IN AN AWFUL POSITION.

12:06.367 --> 12:09.200
BUT HANK AND THE KIDS
CAN'T FIND OUT I SMOKE.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.433
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT HANK WOULD DO.

12:12.433 --> 12:16.000
HE HAS A JAR AT SCHOOL
WITH A BLACK LUNG IN IT.

12:17.467 --> 12:21.033
- YOU KNOW, PAT, YOU HAVE GOT
TO STAND UP FOR YOURSELF.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.367
THIS IS YOUR LIFE.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.567
YOU NEED TO TELL HANK
HOW YOU FEEL.

12:24.567 --> 12:27.033
- OR YOU COULD DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT IN YOUR OWN WAY,

12:27.033 --> 12:30.500
IN YOUR OWN HOUSE.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.400
- I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT, DEBRA.
- SO YOU'LL TALK TO HIM?

12:33.400 --> 12:35.400
- OH, GOOD GRAVY, NO.

12:38.067 --> 12:40.400
- AND I ALSO WORRY
ABOUT OFFSPRING, ROBERT.

12:40.400 --> 12:44.100
DID YOU KNOW THAT ADDICTION
CAN BE AN HEREDITARY TRAIT?

12:44.100 --> 12:46.667
- MY GRANDCHILDREN!

12:49.233 --> 12:50.633
- YES, MARIE,
AND WHAT KIND OF AN EXAMPLE

12:50.633 --> 12:53.400
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL SET
FOR THEM, ROBERT?

12:54.467 --> 12:59.233
- HOPEFULLY GOOD
TO...VERY GOOD.

12:59.233 --> 13:00.633
MOSTLY IN THAT RANGE.

13:00.633 --> 13:02.800
- HMM.

13:02.800 --> 13:03.667
- THE TRUTH IS, AMY,

13:03.667 --> 13:05.933
NONE OF THIS SURPRISES
MOTHER AND ME.

13:05.933 --> 13:09.167
SADLY, WE'VE COME TO EXPECT
THIS SORT OF THING.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.433
- HE'S A RENEGADE COP

13:13.433 --> 13:17.033
WHO PLAYS BY HIS OWN RULES.

13:18.633 --> 13:20.067
PEEUWWW!

13:20.067 --> 13:21.500
- YOU KNOW, ROBERT,

13:21.500 --> 13:25.200
WE WENT TO A GREAT EFFORT
TO TRY TO GET CLOSER TO YOU,

13:25.200 --> 13:27.067
BUT I CAN'T SEE
HOW THAT CAN HAPPEN

13:27.067 --> 13:28.567
WITH YOU BEHAVING THIS WAY.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.700
- PAT'S THE ONE WHO SMOKES!

13:30.700 --> 13:32.067
[all gasp]

13:33.300 --> 13:35.667
GREAT.
I'VE BECOME YOU.

13:36.967 --> 13:38.867
- WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU SAYING, RAYMOND?

13:38.867 --> 13:39.833
- HANK, HANK--

13:39.833 --> 13:41.833
- PAT, PLEASE,
I'M DEFENDING YOUR HONOR.

13:41.833 --> 13:44.300
I WON'T ALLOW YOU
TO DRAG MY FAMILY

13:44.300 --> 13:46.900
INTO THE MUCK AND MUD
ANYMORE.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.333
- I SMOKE!

13:53.100 --> 13:54.800
- MOM?

13:54.800 --> 13:56.733
- [baby voice]
MAMA?

14:02.333 --> 14:04.400
- DON'T BE SILLY.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.167
- ROBERT FOUND ME SMOKING
LAST NIGHT,

14:06.167 --> 14:09.400
AND TO BE CLOSER TO ME--
TO US--

14:09.400 --> 14:12.133
HE PRETENDED THAT HE SMOKED,

14:12.133 --> 14:14.000
WHICH WAS VERY SWEET,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.900
BUT A LITTLE MISGUIDED.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.667
- OH, ROBERT.

14:19.667 --> 14:24.133
- SO SUDDENLY
PAT'S A HERO.

14:24.133 --> 14:27.133
HOW ABOUT IF
I SMOKE "THE POT"?

14:27.133 --> 14:31.167
WOULD YOU BE CLOSER
TO ME THEN?

14:31.167 --> 14:33.100
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU SMOKED?

14:33.100 --> 14:34.767
- TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS.

14:34.767 --> 14:37.767
- OHH, MY GOD!

14:37.767 --> 14:39.167
- I'M SORRY, HANK.

14:39.167 --> 14:40.633
- SMOKING!

14:40.633 --> 14:44.733
SMOKING! IT'S LIKE YOU NEVER
LISTENED TO A WORD I SAID!

14:44.733 --> 14:46.900
- OH, HANK, I LISTEN TO YOU
ALL THE TIME,

14:46.900 --> 14:50.033
AND IT'S HARD,
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO...

14:50.033 --> 14:52.633
OVERLY CERTAIN
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

14:52.633 --> 14:56.300
- YOU MEAN LIKE
"SMOKING IS BAD"?

14:56.300 --> 14:59.733
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DRINK POISON?

15:04.200 --> 15:05.633
- I HAVE TO TELL YOU, HANK,

15:05.633 --> 15:08.300
I DON'T LIKE
THAT TONE OF VOICE.

15:08.300 --> 15:11.533
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE--

15:11.533 --> 15:14.433
I THINK YOU'RE
THE REASON I SMOKE.

15:17.300 --> 15:20.300
NOW, YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU
WITH ALL MY HEART, HANK,

15:20.300 --> 15:23.000
BUT I THINK IF
I DIDN'T HAVE MY CIGARETTES,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.200
I WOULD HAVE TO FIGHT YOU.

15:33.733 --> 15:37.033
MY GOODNESS,
THAT FELT GOOD TO SAY.

15:37.033 --> 15:39.000
THANK YOU, DEBRA.

15:42.867 --> 15:45.100
- "THANK YOU, DEBRA"?

15:45.100 --> 15:47.233
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

15:58.133 --> 16:00.900
- IT'S NOT JUST THE SMOKING
THAT BOTHERS ME.

16:00.900 --> 16:01.967
IT'S YOUR DECEPTION.

16:01.967 --> 16:05.033
EVERY TIME YOU'VE SMOKED,
YOU'VE LIED TO ME.

16:06.300 --> 16:10.000
- ROBERT, I APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
- OH--DADDY, WAIT!
- YEAH, PLEASE.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.433
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE UPSET,

16:14.433 --> 16:16.867
BUT I THINK WHAT YOUR WIFE DID
IS ACTUALLY PRETTY COMMON

16:16.867 --> 16:19.800
BETWEEN MARRIED COUPLES.

16:19.800 --> 16:20.867
IT WASN'T LYING.

16:20.867 --> 16:23.633
IT WAS MORE LIKE SHE WAS JUST
LETTING OFF STEAM

16:23.633 --> 16:26.267
SO YOU DON'T LET IT OUT
ON THE PERSON YOU LOVE.

16:26.267 --> 16:29.267
YOU KNOW?
LIKE RAY.

16:29.267 --> 16:32.067
HE HAS TO DRIVE AROUND THE BLOCK
A FEW TIMES EVERY NIGHT

16:32.067 --> 16:33.167
LISTENING TO THE RADIO

16:33.167 --> 16:35.533
BEFORE HE GOES HOME
TO FACE DEBRA.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.700
- ARE YA CRAZY?

16:54.900 --> 16:56.367
[scoffs]

16:56.367 --> 16:57.900
I DON'T--I--THIS--

16:57.900 --> 16:59.833
- ALL RIGHT, SAVE IT, RAY.

16:59.833 --> 17:02.567
YOU DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN YOU
CIRCLING THE BLOCK,

17:02.567 --> 17:04.067
ALL HUNCHED OVER,

17:04.067 --> 17:05.167
JUST A BIG NOSE

17:05.167 --> 17:08.667
AND A STEERING WHEEL
GOING AROUND?

17:08.667 --> 17:12.200
- SO YOU KNOW
AND YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING?

17:12.200 --> 17:13.467
- NO, I KNOW,
AND I GET MAD,

17:13.467 --> 17:15.767
AND THAT'S WHY AFTER YOU LEAVE,
I EAT CHOCOLATE ALL DAY

17:15.767 --> 17:19.133
UNTIL YOU GET HOME.

17:19.133 --> 17:22.200
- THAT'S A LOT OF SUGAR, DEBRA.

17:25.600 --> 17:29.000
- IS THAT IN ADDITION
TO THE DRINKING?

17:34.700 --> 17:37.067
- YOU KNOW, I REALIZE
THAT I'M NOT MARRIED,

17:37.067 --> 17:40.233
BUT I DO SECRET THINGS TOO.

17:40.233 --> 17:43.233
- WE BELIEVE YOU, PETEY.
EAT YOUR CHIPS.

17:43.233 --> 17:46.033
- LIKE WHEN I'M ANGRY
AT MY CAT "MISS PUSS,"

17:46.033 --> 17:48.033
SOMETIMES I'LL SNEAK UP
BEHIND HER

17:48.033 --> 17:51.300
AND BARK LIKE A DOG.

17:51.300 --> 17:54.167
THAT'S HOW I GOT THIS SCAR.

17:56.967 --> 17:58.433
- PAT!

18:00.567 --> 18:04.700
- I THOUGHT SINCE
IT WASN'T A SECRET ANYMORE...

18:14.667 --> 18:16.267
OKAY.

18:19.767 --> 18:23.300
- DAD, DON'T BE SO ANGRY.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.433
EVERYBODY HAS
THEIR LITTLE WAYS OF COPING

18:25.433 --> 18:27.600
IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP,
EVEN ME.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.233
- OF COURSE.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.167
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU?

18:33.267 --> 18:35.400
- WELL, IT'S NOTHING.
JUST...

18:37.667 --> 18:40.633
YOU KNOW HOW YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO HAVE YOUR TOOTHBRUSH

18:40.633 --> 18:44.900
IN THE HOLDER
ALWAYS FACING TO THE RIGHT?

18:44.900 --> 18:47.800
- YEAH, EAST.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.700
- I KNOW, EAST.

18:49.700 --> 18:53.867
SO SOMETIMES...
I DON'T KNOW WHY...

18:53.867 --> 18:57.367
I TURN IT...

18:57.367 --> 19:00.167
WEST.

19:00.167 --> 19:02.033
- THAT'S YOU?

19:03.833 --> 19:06.567
- I LIKE TO BLOW UP FIREWORKS.

19:12.367 --> 19:14.233
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, HANK?

19:14.233 --> 19:15.467
- THAT'S RIGHT.

19:15.467 --> 19:18.100
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE EASY
TO LIVE WITH ALL THE TIME, PAT?

19:18.100 --> 19:20.200
SO SKITTISH AND FAINT-HEARTED

19:20.200 --> 19:22.433
AND "OH, MY..."

19:25.233 --> 19:28.700
AND LAST YEAR I CAUGHT A STUDENT
WITH FIREWORKS...

19:28.700 --> 19:32.200
AND THEY WERE STILL
IN MY BRIEFCASE WHEN I GOT HOME.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.067
YOU WERE ON THE COUCH
RECUPERATING

19:34.067 --> 19:37.467
FROM YOUR TRIP
TO THE GROCERY STORE.

19:37.467 --> 19:41.400
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
TO JUST GET OVER IT.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.200
INSTEAD, I TOOK THE FIREWORKS
INTO THE WOODS

19:43.200 --> 19:45.600
AND I BLEW THEM UP.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.733
AND I LIKED IT.

19:47.733 --> 19:50.167
SO I GOT MORE.

19:50.167 --> 19:53.133
I HAD TO DRIVE
TO WEST VIRGINIA.

19:53.133 --> 19:56.000
BUT IT FEELS GOOD
TO BE ABLE TO REALLY

19:56.000 --> 20:00.267
MAKE SOME GOSH-DARN NOISE.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.533
- SO WHEN YOU GO
ON YOUR NATURE WALKS--

20:02.533 --> 20:03.667
- THAT'S RIGHT.

20:03.667 --> 20:07.400
I BLOW UP NATURE.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.567
BOOM!!!

20:13.167 --> 20:14.200
-[chuckling]
I'M SORRY,

20:14.200 --> 20:15.667
I KNOW
NONE OF THIS IS FUNNY,

20:15.667 --> 20:18.567
EXCEPT THAT I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU ALL HAVE TO RESORT

20:18.567 --> 20:21.633
TO THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOR
TO DEAL WITH YOUR SPOUSES.

20:23.033 --> 20:25.000
- YOU'RE ALL NUTS.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.700
- YOU'RE LAUGHIN' AT US?
YOU TWO?

20:30.700 --> 20:32.267
- HEY, IF I HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH MARIE,

20:32.267 --> 20:34.100
I DON'T DO ANYTHING
BEHIND HER BACK.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.333
I JUST TURN TO HER AND SAY,

20:36.333 --> 20:41.767
"EXCUSE ME, DARLING.
PUT A SOCK IN IT."

20:41.767 --> 20:43.033
- AND I DO THE SAME THING.

20:43.033 --> 20:47.867
IT'S NOT HEALTHY TO HOLD IN
ALL THOSE NEGATIVE FEELINGS.

20:47.867 --> 20:51.067
- AND YOU TWO ARE HEALTHY?

20:51.067 --> 20:53.067
- DO WE SMOKE?

20:53.067 --> 20:54.833
OR PLAY WITH GUN POWDER?

20:54.833 --> 20:57.100
OR BARK AT THE CAT?

21:03.933 --> 21:06.600
- WHO WANTS SOME LOUSY CAKE?
- YEAH.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.167
[all agree]

21:08.167 --> 21:10.767
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
TO LIGHT THE CANDLES.

21:10.767 --> 21:13.000
- OH, I GOT IT.

21:19.533 --> 21:21.267
IT MUST BE
OUT OF FLUID.

21:21.267 --> 21:23.633
- HERE, I'VE GOT
SOME MATCHES.

21:32.467 --> 21:34.433
YOU KNOW, IF THAT CAKE
REALLY IS LOUSY,

21:34.433 --> 21:36.733
WE COULD JUST
BLOW IT UP.
