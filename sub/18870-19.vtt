WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.136
<i>Previously, on "Being Mary Jane..."</i>

00:03.203 --> 00:05.705
- Have you seen this?
- Seen what?

00:06.039 --> 00:07.841
Justin's ex-girlfriend, apparently.

00:07.907 --> 00:08.975
This is Simone?

00:09.309 --> 00:12.812
And the general consensus
is that he got a serious upgrade in you.

00:12.879 --> 00:14.614
At least they're complimenting you.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.817
Yeah, at the expense of the woman
that was the love of Justin's life.

00:18.151 --> 00:19.319
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

00:19.386 --> 00:21.755
<i>This was
your mother's secret to tell, not mine.</i>

00:21.821 --> 00:25.358
All those years I struggled with drugs.
You didn't tell me it was in my blood?

00:25.425 --> 00:27.260
There are rumors just flying all around

00:27.327 --> 00:31.965
that Garrett is considering
EPing Orlando's new sports show.

00:32.031 --> 00:36.136
If this works, and Garrett leaves "GDU",
I wanna be considered for his job.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.439
- And I know Justin will too.
- But the good news is

00:39.506 --> 00:42.709
I will have absolutely no say
in who replaces Garrett, so...

00:42.776 --> 00:45.578
- Whatever happens after that...
- Is on you and Justin.

00:53.286 --> 00:56.055
So was that worth flying
all the way back from Paris for?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.057
I'd say so.

00:59.659 --> 01:01.795
And you haven't checked your phone once.

01:02.328 --> 01:03.830
That's a total reboot, right?

01:04.197 --> 01:05.465
The past is in the past?

01:06.232 --> 01:09.502
So you're not secretly filming this?

01:10.303 --> 01:11.471
I'm serious.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.240
I've learned a lot
since you've been gone.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.409
I'm almost a new woman.

01:16.476 --> 01:17.877
Don't change too much.

01:18.711 --> 01:20.213
I liked what I had before.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.304
Look at these stats.

01:44.838 --> 01:48.007
Bleak, right?
I mean, wake up, white America.

01:48.074 --> 01:50.477
Black women hold the key
to your future, right?

01:52.745 --> 01:54.614
- Mary Jane?
- Yes?

01:55.081 --> 01:58.218
Honey, this nighttime special
could change things for you.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.786
Yes, and for you as well.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.288
Yeah, it gives me
a better shot at Garrett's job.

02:02.822 --> 02:03.823
Look at me.

02:04.757 --> 02:07.393
- You haven't heard one word I've said.
- I'm sorry, girl, I...

02:08.995 --> 02:11.064
I've just learned so much about myself

02:11.131 --> 02:13.833
since Justin's been gone,
and I was really excited

02:13.900 --> 02:16.636
to just try everything out on him
once he got back, but I don't...

02:17.237 --> 02:18.638
I don't think he's ready.

02:18.705 --> 02:22.308
He came back early from Paris for you.
He sent you flowers, honey.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.511
- What do you want?
- He doesn't look me in the eye

02:24.577 --> 02:26.346
- when we make love.
- Never?

02:26.412 --> 02:28.515
He looks at me, but it's not...

02:29.782 --> 02:33.453
You know, when you hit that sweet spot,
and you feel you're really connecting,

02:33.520 --> 02:36.022
and you just wanna look your man
in the eye so you can really feel it?

02:37.056 --> 02:38.958
Yeah, well, he looks away.

02:39.559 --> 02:40.660
Like this is me,

02:42.495 --> 02:43.596
and this is him.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.865
Sex is complicated.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.469
But that man cares about you, Mary Jane.
Even I can see that.

02:49.536 --> 02:51.037
Caring is very nice.

02:51.104 --> 02:54.007
But we both know that it takes
a lot more than that to go the distance.

02:58.378 --> 03:01.948
An AIDS gala? Really?
You know that's not my brand.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.618
Any correspondent
would kill to get that assignment.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.754
Well, I'm not any correspondent.

03:08.154 --> 03:09.622
Okay, Dani.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.259
Let's see what we've got here.

03:14.394 --> 03:17.530
The Oklahoma legislators
spent four times as many hours

03:17.597 --> 03:21.000
debating their bathroom bill
as they did their school budget.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.836
Their spending per student
is one of the lowest in the country.

03:24.237 --> 03:27.340
My mom and dad still live in Ponca City.
I'm not touching that.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.542
Okay, how about this one?

03:29.609 --> 03:33.112
Possible musicians' strike
looming on Broadway. That's a good one.

03:33.179 --> 03:36.583
They make a thousand dollars a night.
What do they have to strike about?

03:36.649 --> 03:38.117
You're being unreasonable.

03:38.184 --> 03:41.120
All these pitches are great story ideas
for a new correspondent.

03:41.187 --> 03:43.656
Right now,
I get to do the stories that I want,

03:43.723 --> 03:46.426
- how am I being unreasonable?
- Everyone wants to do stories

03:46.492 --> 03:48.795
that fascinate them,
but you gotta pay your dues.

03:48.861 --> 03:51.731
I have paid my dues.
Do you see how many followers I have?

03:51.798 --> 03:56.135
Getting someone to click on your face
does not equal journalistic experience.

03:56.202 --> 03:59.138
You're right. Clicks are way better.

03:59.205 --> 04:00.540
Thanks for pointing that out.

04:03.209 --> 04:05.511
Hi, I forgot to mention earlier...

04:05.578 --> 04:08.081
Yeah, the travel segment
got pushed. I already heard.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.750
No, that's not it.
I was actually gonna warn you

04:10.817 --> 04:12.652
that Tiffany may try and contact you.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.821
- Tiffany?
- Simone's sister.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.024
She has it out for us
because of the way her sister

04:18.091 --> 04:19.692
was talked about on social media.

04:19.759 --> 04:23.196
She was rattled by that, but that's not
why she's trying to reach out to you.

04:23.262 --> 04:26.666
- Tiffany and her husband are like family.
- So why is she trying to contact me?

04:27.066 --> 04:28.935
She's trying to get you on her side.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.838
I think Ty would agree
that I need more words.

04:32.305 --> 04:35.274
She's trying to stop me
from donating the rest of Simone's money.

04:35.341 --> 04:37.443
- Donating to charity?
- Yeah.

04:38.511 --> 04:40.580
- All of it?
- All 30 million dollars.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.323
Good morning.

04:51.324 --> 04:53.559
Niecy Patterson up for work
at the crack of dawn.

04:55.061 --> 04:57.330
Yeah, Claudia wants me
to open up the salon,

04:57.397 --> 04:59.399
so I have to drop the kids off early
at Amika's.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.735
- She's gonna answer the door this time?
- I know, right?

05:02.802 --> 05:04.904
I had a conversation with her about that.

05:06.005 --> 05:07.306
You know, she's trying,

05:08.408 --> 05:10.910
but those car seat requests
come in at all hours.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.646
- You really got something going.
- Yeah, I saw a need

05:13.713 --> 05:16.416
- and did something about it.
- Well, that takes vision.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.285
I'm proud of you,
and how hard you've been working.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.620
- Keep it up.
- I will.

05:22.288 --> 05:23.289
Good morning.

05:24.023 --> 05:25.491
Anybody for some eggs?

05:26.526 --> 05:27.493
I'm fryin'.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.797
No, I'm good.
I'll just grab something on the road.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.467
I'm good too, Grandpa.
I'll catch you next time.

05:34.834 --> 05:35.802
Thank you.

05:38.004 --> 05:38.971
All right.

05:42.141 --> 05:45.178
- Still givin' Grandpa the cold shoulder?
- You still call him that?

05:45.244 --> 05:46.813
What else am I supposed to call him?

05:47.213 --> 05:50.216
You need to work this out.
It's uncomfortable being around you two.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.018
You're the one handin' out advice now?

05:52.085 --> 05:53.119
Yes, I am.

05:53.453 --> 05:57.056
You're mad because that old, drunk guy
didn't get a chance to raise you?

05:57.123 --> 05:59.392
Not only did Grandpa take you in,

05:59.459 --> 06:01.994
he took in your children
and grandchildren,

06:02.061 --> 06:03.296
and called them his own.

06:03.996 --> 06:05.998
That does not deserve
the silent treatment.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.801
You really need to get over yourself.

06:12.739 --> 06:14.207
- I got you.
- Easy. Easy.

06:14.273 --> 06:16.109
I told you. I'm fine.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.644
I took a spin class this morning
and skipped breakfast.

06:18.711 --> 06:19.979
Not smart.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.615
If it's all the same,
I'll have a medic take a look at you.

06:22.682 --> 06:23.683
Thank you.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.153
But, girl, if you let that man give away

06:27.220 --> 06:29.689
- thirty million dollars...
- I do not intend to.

06:30.423 --> 06:32.358
But if he does, can you convince him

06:32.425 --> 06:35.161
to throw just one tenth
of one per cent of it my way?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.195
I mean...

06:42.502 --> 06:43.469
Hi.

06:43.936 --> 06:47.940
That bitch, Dani, turned down
every single one of my story ideas.

06:48.474 --> 06:51.377
Millennials don't feel like they have
to work to get anything.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.746
They feel like everything
should be handed to them.

06:53.813 --> 06:56.616
If I would have known she was gonna be
this hard to deal with,

06:56.682 --> 06:59.385
I would have never told Garrett
I'd frickin' babysit her.

06:59.452 --> 07:00.853
Wait, wait...

07:01.554 --> 07:03.689
Who's that sitting in Garrett's chair?

07:05.458 --> 07:07.059
Pete Binswanger. You heard of him?

07:07.126 --> 07:09.762
No. I thought I knew
every senior producer in the business.

07:09.829 --> 07:12.198
What? Is he from CNN? MSNBC?

07:12.632 --> 07:15.835
Apparently, he stepped away
from running the amusement park division.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.938
What? That's Garrett's fill-in,
the roller coaster king?

07:19.005 --> 07:20.139
Are you kidding me?

07:20.206 --> 07:23.476
Just another symptom of the whitewashing
that's going on at every level.

07:23.543 --> 07:25.344
- My goodness.
- Execs tend to go

07:25.411 --> 07:26.712
for an out-of-the-box choice.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.983
Typically, a risk-taking,
hyper-confident white male.

07:31.584 --> 07:33.686
Before doubling profits in theme parks,

07:34.520 --> 07:36.155
he ran a few local affiliates.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.391
He has no national news experience.

07:38.457 --> 07:40.693
Sounds like an election I seem to recall.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.396
Listen, this guy Pete
is gonna get Garrett's job

07:43.462 --> 07:45.631
if one of us
doesn't do something real quick.

07:46.165 --> 07:49.035
I have an idea, but it's gonna take
all of us working together.

07:53.840 --> 07:54.807
Okay.

07:55.741 --> 07:56.709
Kara?

07:57.844 --> 07:59.378
You've been struggling with Dani?

08:00.112 --> 08:02.982
Yeah, but suddenly she doesn't seem
like that big of a deal.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.885
Well, maybe we can turn
our two problems into one.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.286
Dani and Pete?

08:07.954 --> 08:10.089
We feed Dani a story
she simply cannot refuse.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.626
Then we convince Pete
to take Dani under his wing.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.362
Once she self-destructs,
she may take them both out.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.731
A story she can't refuse?
Does that even exist?

08:18.798 --> 08:21.067
- I think I have an idea that might work.
- Okay,

08:21.133 --> 08:24.136
but I am not gonna use
any Justin-style dirty tricks

08:24.203 --> 08:26.772
- to get this done.
- I don't traffic in dirty tricks.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.808
- What do you call it?
- Being effective.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.243
- Effective?
- Guys, focus.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.778
M.J. wouldn't be in the anchor chair
if it wasn't for me.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.213
You mean the anchor chair

08:34.280 --> 08:36.249
that was promised to her
when I got her hired?

08:36.315 --> 08:38.084
She would've waited years for her shot,

08:38.150 --> 08:40.720
- waitin' on you.
- Instead, you rocked the boat so hard

08:40.786 --> 08:42.688
that you almost tip the damn thing over.

08:42.755 --> 08:44.190
You made some moves yourself,

08:44.524 --> 08:46.859
like gettin' Garrett promoted
while I was outta town.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.262
Obviously, this isn't gonna work.

08:49.328 --> 08:50.363
Mary Jane...

08:50.429 --> 08:53.933
I've got a show to do, and you guys
might as well say hello to Pete,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.601
because he's gonna be our new boss.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.290
Look, one thing we can agree on is...

09:17.356 --> 09:18.991
We can't agree on anything.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.893
So how are we gonna do this?

09:20.960 --> 09:24.630
Talking is gonna get us in trouble.
So, we're gonna just write

09:26.799 --> 09:27.733
it down.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.168
My God.

09:51.557 --> 09:52.725
Kara, what are you doing?

10:31.931 --> 10:33.966
- What's up?
- Hi, Javon.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.267
You live here?

10:35.334 --> 10:36.502
What is this place?

10:36.936 --> 10:38.037
Cheap.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.171
That's what it is.

11:05.231 --> 11:08.000
Hi, did you add an appointment
and you need me to come back?

11:08.067 --> 11:10.403
<i>No, sweetie,
I'm calling because your friend Amika</i>

11:10.469 --> 11:12.204
<i>was supposed to drop off a car seat,</i>

11:12.271 --> 11:15.274
<i>but never showed up,
and now my friend Shawna is high and dry.</i>

11:15.341 --> 11:18.411
I'm sorry. I'm sure there's
a perfectly logical explanation.

11:18.811 --> 11:22.681
<i>If you're gonna promote something,
you'd better make sure it's legit.</i>

11:22.748 --> 11:26.652
<i>There are too many screw-ups out here,
and you can get a bad reputation quickly.</i>

11:26.719 --> 11:28.988
<i>-Don't expect me to refer you to anybody.
- Okay. Bye.</i>

11:38.364 --> 11:39.432
Hi, Niecy.

11:43.002 --> 11:44.136
Come on in. Come on.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.239
Who are you, and how do you know my name?

11:47.907 --> 11:51.110
My name is Lloyd. I live two doors down.
Amika gives me a couple of bucks

11:51.177 --> 11:54.246
to step in whenever she's busy.
She told me you were comin' through.

11:54.313 --> 11:55.614
She ain't here?

11:55.681 --> 11:58.984
I mean, nah, but don't worry.
The kids are just in the back playin'.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.086
Everything's good.

12:00.152 --> 12:03.489
Wait a minute. So it's not the first time
that you've taken care of my kids?

12:03.556 --> 12:05.057
- No, it's not...
- Niecy!

12:05.391 --> 12:07.326
Hi. I want you to meet Cedric.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.929
Can I please talk to you for a minute?

12:16.635 --> 12:21.207
I know you don't have two strange men
that I don't know around my kids.

12:21.273 --> 12:25.077
It's not like that. Lloyd's studying
for his childcare license.

12:25.144 --> 12:28.114
Lloyd could be a prince,
but he wasn't part of our deal.

12:28.180 --> 12:31.684
Claudia says you had to take a car seat
to a lady named Shawna and never showed?

12:32.051 --> 12:34.620
And now my boss is telling me
to get my shit together.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.922
Cedric got off work early,
and he wanted to hang.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.091
Girl, I'm done.

12:39.158 --> 12:41.026
- What do you mean?
- I'm done helping you.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.729
I'll watch Marqui this weekend
like I said I would,

12:43.796 --> 12:47.133
but after that, it's over.
I can't leave my kids with you anymore.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.906
Come on, baby, let's go.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.208
Say bye to Marqui.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.276
Bye, Marqui.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.512
Bye, little man.

13:05.217 --> 13:06.418
- All right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:06.785 --> 13:07.820
Yo, Jovan.

13:08.888 --> 13:09.822
You know him?

13:12.191 --> 13:13.392
I'm here for the meeting.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.793
Is there a problem? Jovan?

13:16.128 --> 13:18.430
He's welcome to be here
for Black Lives Matter, right?

13:19.498 --> 13:21.167
Yeah, man... It's cool.

13:28.674 --> 13:30.342
I'm glad you two suggested this.

13:30.409 --> 13:31.443
"Salud!"

13:36.382 --> 13:37.883
We use a portable brain scanner

13:38.450 --> 13:42.588
to measure which pleasure centers
light up at the height of the ride.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.256
That is beyond amazing.

13:44.323 --> 13:49.028
We hit the same group of neurons
that measure sexual pleasure,

13:49.094 --> 13:51.897
and then we tweak the ride
to prolong the feeling.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.801
Pete, I know
you don't have a lot of time.

13:55.868 --> 13:59.071
So we thought it'd be beneficial
to let you hear how the show's going.

13:59.138 --> 14:01.540
That's okay, no sweat.
I already got the gist.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.409
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:03.475 --> 14:04.843
- Good.
- Yeah, very good.

14:05.377 --> 14:08.247
And Aaron and Mary Jane
are really starting to click.

14:08.314 --> 14:10.983
Earlier in the season,
we had to readjust her image a little.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.985
Because of Ronda's abrupt exit.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.620
But Ronda's mostly a memory now.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.056
And Mary Jane's audience numbers
are way up.

14:17.556 --> 14:19.625
- That's great.
- The team is meshing nicely.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.827
- Nice.
- You've stepped into a good situation.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.028
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.

14:23.095 --> 14:24.830
Well, with one exception.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.933
We've had a little bit of a problem
getting Dani to sign on

14:28.000 --> 14:29.702
to certain story ideas.

14:29.768 --> 14:32.104
Sign on? What is this, nursery school?

14:32.171 --> 14:35.941
You guys are news producers.
Stories are assigned. Period.

14:36.008 --> 14:37.910
It's mostly Kara
that's having a tough time.

14:38.577 --> 14:41.814
Actually, I think everyone
finds her a bit challenging.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.683
With Dani's online footprint,
she should be front and center.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.353
Agreed, and I've got
a great story idea for her

14:47.419 --> 14:50.122
that I've been dying to pitch,
it's about Marci Livingston.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.958
- You've heard this pitch?
- I have. Tailor-made for Dani.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.028
Marci blogs about renovating
old homes in middle America.

14:56.095 --> 14:58.597
Yep, that's right.
She is a red-blooded woman

14:58.664 --> 15:01.000
- making America great again.
- You like this idea?

15:01.066 --> 15:04.303
I do, but since Kara's having
a tough time connecting with Dani,

15:04.370 --> 15:08.641
- I was gonna suggest that I pitch it.
- Thank you for that offer, Justin,

15:08.707 --> 15:10.542
but I think I can handle it, thank you.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.611
You just mentioned
how challenging Dani...

15:12.678 --> 15:13.679
Guys, guys.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.548
This story... This story isn't the best.

15:16.982 --> 15:19.418
- I'm sure I could do much better.
- Maybe if we rework it?

15:19.485 --> 15:20.719
No, no. Leave it to me.

15:20.786 --> 15:23.155
I'm gonna come up with something
Dani's gonna love.

15:23.222 --> 15:25.457
Just watch.
Listen, great chattin' with you two.

15:25.524 --> 15:26.592
- Yeah.
- See ya.

15:28.894 --> 15:29.862
Dammit.

15:46.045 --> 15:48.981
If you still need a ride,
I'm gonna be waitin' in the car, okay?

15:49.348 --> 15:51.483
No... I'm good, man.

15:57.056 --> 15:58.123
Jovan.

15:58.190 --> 15:59.158
Damn!

16:03.228 --> 16:05.230
<i>It's what's been trending most
of the demos.</i>

16:05.297 --> 16:08.500
Yeah, yeah.
They tried showing me all these surveys

16:08.567 --> 16:11.303
and demographic breakdowns
and what-not upstairs.

16:13.272 --> 16:14.640
You know what it comes down to?

16:15.674 --> 16:16.675
Nakedness.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.778
It's the morning, for Christ sake.

16:19.845 --> 16:23.749
What percentage of the audience
is watching us with no clothes on?

16:24.083 --> 16:26.952
We need to make them
feel comfortable enough

16:27.386 --> 16:29.154
to take their clothes off in front of us.

16:29.588 --> 16:31.724
Well, heck, I started
my blog in my pajamas.

16:31.790 --> 16:32.991
I know all about that.

16:33.058 --> 16:35.227
Maybe we should have a "GDU" pajama day.

16:35.294 --> 16:37.896
All on-air talent appears in sleepwear.

16:38.297 --> 16:40.999
We can get a department store
to sponsor it. Write that down.

16:41.066 --> 16:44.770
I did actually read somewhere
that sleep is the new sex.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.606
"Sleep is the new sex!"

16:47.940 --> 16:49.375
I freakin' love that!

16:49.441 --> 16:53.212
That's a perfect segment for you, M.J.
Let's get rollin' on that for next week.

16:53.278 --> 16:55.013
- Fantastic!
- My God,

16:55.080 --> 16:58.484
you guys are so lucky to have me,

16:58.851 --> 17:03.455
because... a great story
came to me last night,

17:03.522 --> 17:07.359
and I think, personally,
that it would be perfect

17:07.793 --> 17:11.830
for Dani to do
in the 8:12 a.m. slot tomorrow.

17:11.897 --> 17:12.998
I'm all ears.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.467
It's a story
about a successful young woman

17:15.968 --> 17:18.437
who fixes up old homes in rural areas,

17:19.138 --> 17:23.208
trying to bring relevance
and beauty to middle America.

17:23.275 --> 17:24.476
It sounds interesting.

17:25.544 --> 17:26.712
It's perfect.

17:27.312 --> 17:30.449
A red-blooded woman
making America great again.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.751
I love that idea!

17:33.452 --> 17:36.321
I am so glad that someone
is finally recognizing

17:36.388 --> 17:38.490
the real people of America.

17:44.963 --> 17:45.898
- Pete.
- Yo.

17:46.698 --> 17:49.535
Thanks so much for that story.
You really seem to get me.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.874
See?

17:55.941 --> 17:59.578
Bottom line.
Every job is just a sales job.

18:00.145 --> 18:01.780
It's easy. It's easy.

18:02.948 --> 18:03.916
Nice job, team.

18:05.651 --> 18:06.852
Let's just hope it works.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.094
Yeah, it's me.

18:19.832 --> 18:23.001
Justin, you were right about Tiffany.
She just contacted me.

18:23.068 --> 18:25.270
- Did you respond?
- Not yet, but I was thinking,

18:25.337 --> 18:27.306
maybe we could invite her out for drinks.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.842
So you can pump her
for more information about Simone?

18:29.908 --> 18:30.843
No.

18:31.543 --> 18:33.846
I would like to get to know
some of your peeps.

18:34.513 --> 18:37.416
But she's gonna try to convince me
to keep the money, that's all.

18:37.483 --> 18:38.851
Is that such a bad thing?

18:38.917 --> 18:41.386
I thought you wanted
to put the past behind us.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.888
- I do.
- That's what this is.

18:43.222 --> 18:46.525
Look, my last night in Paris,
I decided a few things about Simone.

18:46.592 --> 18:49.461
Not just the whole social media fiasco,
the whole relationship.

18:50.696 --> 18:53.665
I realized I just want
to lock the whole thing up in a box

18:53.732 --> 18:55.133
and forget it ever happened.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.004
Okay.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.607
So let's just leave
that subject where it is, okay?

19:10.382 --> 19:11.483
Marci.

19:11.550 --> 19:12.951
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:13.018 --> 19:14.319
Welcome to the show.

19:14.786 --> 19:18.290
I heard that you're from north Texas.
I'm from northern Oklahoma.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.459
- You ever heard of Gainesville, Texas?
- Sure.

19:20.526 --> 19:22.094
I did a blog post there one time.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.395
- Dani Hollins.
- Hi.

19:24.429 --> 19:27.799
Your city has one of the biggest
airline seat factories in the world.

19:27.866 --> 19:29.701
Talk about good old American ingenuity.

19:29.768 --> 19:32.838
We export all over the world.
Don't say the American industry is dead.

19:34.206 --> 19:35.741
Any questions about the segment?

19:35.807 --> 19:38.510
No. I just hope I don't make
a fool outta myself out there.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.812
You recorded segments for your blog?

19:40.879 --> 19:42.714
- Hundreds.
- It's really no different.

19:42.781 --> 19:46.585
Just be yourself and know that I will be
there with you the whole time.

19:46.652 --> 19:47.786
- Okay?
- Okay.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.157
I've worked hard to bring back
these small, plain towns,

19:52.224 --> 19:56.295
by buying empty houses, restoring them
to an honesty country beauty,

19:56.361 --> 19:59.798
then stocking them full of young families
who bring a new sense of community.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.768
Ask her about the employees
that work on these houses.

20:02.834 --> 20:06.538
Where do you find the people
with the talent for these restorations?

20:06.605 --> 20:09.508
It's not easy to find the right people
in these small towns.

20:09.575 --> 20:10.876
I know how it is.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.946
The young 'uns always move away.
The ones with ambition, anyways.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.281
Poverty and addiction
take a real toll on the rest.

20:16.348 --> 20:19.618
In the beginning it was tough
because I could not find reliable crews.

20:19.685 --> 20:21.186
How'd you overcome that?

20:21.820 --> 20:22.754
I prayed on it.

20:23.422 --> 20:26.625
And I found
an untapped pool of great talent.

20:26.692 --> 20:30.662
How did you entice them to come
to that itty-bitty Texas town of yours?

20:31.129 --> 20:34.032
You know, it was not tough,
given where they're comin' from.

20:34.633 --> 20:38.303
I hire refugees and they are grateful
to be in this country.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.206
Refugees?
You mean, like, from the Middle East?

20:41.273 --> 20:43.442
<i>- Yes, immigrants from countries
- Go in on Dani.</i>

20:43.508 --> 20:46.044
like Syria, are often
the only people I can find

20:46.111 --> 20:48.747
that are willing to do
certain tough jobs.

20:48.814 --> 20:51.249
I assume that we're not talking
about Christians here.

20:51.316 --> 20:52.751
You employ Muslims?

20:53.418 --> 20:54.720
<i>And I don't only employ them.</i>

20:54.786 --> 20:57.022
<i>With the help of donations
from all over the world,</i>

20:57.089 --> 21:00.392
most of the families who rent my houses
are newly-arrived refugees,

21:00.459 --> 21:01.860
and most are Muslim.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.096
Aren't you worried
about the terrorist threat?

21:04.162 --> 21:07.032
These people aren't terrorists.
They're families like ours

21:07.099 --> 21:09.601
who are looking to build
a better future for their kids.

21:09.668 --> 21:13.038
And look at these neighborhoods.
You know, we had tons of vacant stores.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.873
Could not lure new businesses here.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.342
But now our town center's thriving again.

21:17.409 --> 21:18.977
It just seems like such a risk.

21:19.044 --> 21:21.546
Well, would it have been better
to let my little town die?

21:21.980 --> 21:24.883
Mothers with children
are in search for a place to call home,

21:24.950 --> 21:26.818
<i>and we have a town in search of people.</i>

21:26.885 --> 21:29.821
Why wouldn't we put the two together?
It's the Christian thing to do.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.523
Well...

21:31.590 --> 21:33.191
Being a good Christian myself,

21:33.258 --> 21:35.794
I have to say
that with the right provisions in place,

21:35.861 --> 21:37.429
it does seem to make sense.

21:38.697 --> 21:42.634
Did we just get her to throw down
against the Muslim ban on national TV?

21:43.702 --> 21:44.903
Are you that good?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.505
- I am.
- Yes, you are.

21:48.707 --> 21:49.775
Yes, you are.

21:55.313 --> 21:58.183
Hi. Great job with Marci.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.853
Yeah, it looked like you two
were really... connecting.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.123
Next time, I would appreciate it
if you warned me ahead of time

22:05.190 --> 22:07.926
that my interview subject
is harboring ISIS.

22:08.326 --> 22:12.230
My gosh, Pete didn't prep you for Marci?
Everything was in the research file.

22:12.297 --> 22:13.865
You did read the file, right?

22:14.266 --> 22:15.600
Not every word, no.

22:16.868 --> 22:19.905
Well, maybe he wanted you
to be surprised.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.374
- Yeah.
- I've been online since I was 11.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.376
I think I can tell
when I'm bein' trolled.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.083
- I know what you're up to.
- Let me call you back. What's up?

22:31.149 --> 22:33.685
Don't play games with me.
I know exactly what's goin' on.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.554
You set me up.

22:35.620 --> 22:36.788
What? It's crazy.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.326
- I handed you a job.
- But you didn't tell me everything...

22:48.100 --> 22:51.236
Well, I never thought I'd say this,
but here's to Dani.

22:52.738 --> 22:53.705
To Dani.

22:54.339 --> 22:55.574
Pete never saw it comin'.

22:57.642 --> 23:00.712
I wish I could've been a fly on the wall
when she confronted Sawyer.

23:01.413 --> 23:02.681
You know what?

23:02.748 --> 23:03.882
Here's to Mary Jane.

23:05.016 --> 23:06.051
This was your idea.

23:06.585 --> 23:09.421
But we never could have done it
if we didn't all pull together.

23:10.188 --> 23:13.225
Well, I will say this.
It worked this time.

23:13.291 --> 23:16.194
- Pete is out.
- Yeah, we had a plan and we executed it.

23:16.661 --> 23:19.998
Still... I'm still surprised
that Dani had enough pull.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.235
You know, it didn't hurt
that Aaron also thought Pete was an ass

23:23.301 --> 23:25.036
and shared his feelings with Sawyer.

23:25.103 --> 23:26.738
- Yes.
- And maybe I might have had

23:28.106 --> 23:29.875
a little something to do with it as well.

23:29.941 --> 23:32.377
- Really?
- I made my own calls upstairs

23:32.444 --> 23:35.046
after Dani yelled herself hoarse.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.315
I am co-anchor, after all.

23:37.649 --> 23:39.484
So, what did you say?

23:39.885 --> 23:42.154
I said that whoever
is Garrett's replacement

23:42.220 --> 23:44.723
should have real experience,
and that the best candidates

23:45.423 --> 23:46.558
are already working here.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.461
But whoever he picks,
look, I'm Switzerland.

23:49.528 --> 23:50.529
I'm totally neutral.

24:08.947 --> 24:11.016
- You still gon' give me a ride?
- Why wouldn't I?

24:13.518 --> 24:14.786
Come on. Are you comin' or not?

24:20.225 --> 24:23.862
Javon, you know everything I said
about havin' your back still stands, man.

24:23.929 --> 24:25.697
I don't feel any differently about you.

24:25.764 --> 24:27.499
I don't get how you're so cool about it.

24:27.566 --> 24:30.035
- How else am I gonna be?
- Look, I don't know, all right?

24:31.670 --> 24:32.904
I'm not cool with it myself.

24:34.072 --> 24:35.307
Not really.

24:35.373 --> 24:37.976
I mean, you could have told me
before I found out the way I did,

24:38.643 --> 24:39.978
but that's okay.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.213
How long have you known?

24:42.380 --> 24:45.317
I guess... I've always liked men.

24:45.884 --> 24:47.686
But I never wanted to be that way.

24:48.353 --> 24:49.654
I took a lot of shit for it.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.189
- From who?
- Everybody.

24:52.023 --> 24:53.058
My dad, especially.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.228
- That's why you're on your own?
- Yeah.

24:57.062 --> 24:58.630
Not everybody has a family like you.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.533
My family ain't perfect either.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.767
They accepted you, right?

25:05.337 --> 25:07.105
Isn't that what you said? The good

25:08.340 --> 25:09.374
and the bad.

25:09.441 --> 25:11.376
Now there's nothin' bad
about you, all right?

25:12.244 --> 25:13.712
You've got a lot to offer the world.

25:14.412 --> 25:15.380
Remember that.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.216
Yeah.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.318
Come on, let's go.

25:36.801 --> 25:38.737
- Right?
- Yeah, you didn't think about that.

25:39.671 --> 25:41.873
This was nice, you guys, I have to say.

25:43.341 --> 25:45.644
I could get used to this,
the three of us hangin' out.

25:46.344 --> 25:48.813
Yeah, well, on that note,

25:48.880 --> 25:52.817
I'm going to go before you start trying
to have us hold hands and sing "Kumbaya".

25:54.052 --> 25:56.788
You guys have a great night,
and I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

25:56.855 --> 25:58.323
- Get home safe.
- Goodnight.

26:00.425 --> 26:03.495
Yeah, look, it is getting kind of late
so we should get going.

26:03.862 --> 26:07.666
You know how I said
that Tiffany contacted me?

26:08.867 --> 26:11.770
I kinda did respond to her request.

26:11.836 --> 26:13.071
Her request for what?

26:13.405 --> 26:14.806
Justin!

26:16.274 --> 26:18.209
Hi, Tiffany.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.712
- Hi. I...
- Hi!

26:20.779 --> 26:21.746
Hi.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.183
You are even prettier in person.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.785
It's so great to meet you.

26:27.852 --> 26:30.689
And don't be mad at her
for springing this on you.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.891
I pestered her. She had no choice.

26:32.958 --> 26:33.925
I don't doubt that.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.061
Clearly I'm being outmatched here.

26:38.396 --> 26:42.200
We had to stop him from giving away
all of Simone's money the first time.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.402
We compromised with half.

26:44.469 --> 26:46.504
Simone gave me the money
to do whatever I wanted.

26:47.105 --> 26:49.374
Okay, has Mary Jane seen
that farmhouse upstate?

26:49.441 --> 26:51.876
- It is still on the market.
- What farmhouse?

26:51.943 --> 26:55.313
Justin always dreamed
of finding an idyllic place upstate,

26:55.380 --> 26:58.083
but he still won't part
with Simone's money.

26:58.616 --> 27:00.018
It's not like that.

27:00.352 --> 27:03.788
Me, on the other hand,
I'm using the money to improve my life.

27:04.489 --> 27:06.558
This is our house on Martha's Vineyard,

27:06.624 --> 27:09.260
where we vacation
twice a year with the kids.

27:09.327 --> 27:11.396
Gosh, you have a beautiful family.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.497
Thank you.

27:12.564 --> 27:15.233
We love Martha's Vineyard,
but it's not that convenient.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.069
Getting upstate should be easier.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.505
Not everyone
has summers off like you do, Tiffany.

27:20.572 --> 27:23.408
Well I'm having fun,
and I wish you would too.

27:24.109 --> 27:25.643
You know that's what she wanted.

27:25.710 --> 27:28.613
I guess I'm just not
that fun guy, you know?

27:29.814 --> 27:30.782
Excuse me.

27:34.552 --> 27:35.854
Have you got a menu?

27:35.920 --> 27:39.424
It is so good to meet somebody
that Justin's involved with.

27:39.491 --> 27:43.762
It's great meeting you too.
I am finding this... very illuminating.

27:45.363 --> 27:49.501
I do wish I would've been able
to meet Simone, she seemed impressive.

27:50.435 --> 27:52.971
How we love to turn the dead into saints.

27:53.471 --> 27:56.408
Simone did a lot for others,
but she wasn't perfect.

27:57.208 --> 28:00.812
If she were still alive,
she'd be on her second divorce.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.783
- But Justin...
- My sister was complicated.

28:06.251 --> 28:07.819
I didn't expect you to be so honest.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.921
I've known Justin since high school.

28:11.056 --> 28:12.724
I'm worried he's stuck.

28:12.791 --> 28:14.492
He says he's moved on.

28:14.559 --> 28:17.162
How? By giving away my sister's money?

28:17.228 --> 28:19.864
To me, that says
he's more hung up than ever.

28:21.099 --> 28:23.935
I wish Justin
could make peace with Simone's death.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.138
Simone did so much and had no regrets.

28:28.073 --> 28:30.375
I wish he could say the same.

28:36.381 --> 28:37.582
Justin.

28:37.649 --> 28:40.552
I'm not talking about this money anymore.
I've made the decision.

28:42.787 --> 28:44.389
You know how I say sometimes

28:44.456 --> 28:47.625
I go looking for the thing
that's gonna end the relationship?

28:47.692 --> 28:49.494
- I think I've found it.
- Yeah?

28:49.561 --> 28:50.962
Yeah, you.

28:52.197 --> 28:55.266
- Me?
- You're gonna sabotage this relationship.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.401
You already are,

28:57.168 --> 28:59.337
which is weird
because that's normally my thing.

28:59.771 --> 29:01.840
How am I sabotaging anything?

29:01.906 --> 29:04.209
By sharing with you my decision
to donate the money?

29:04.275 --> 29:05.643
By being transparent?

29:05.710 --> 29:09.747
I'm trying to put the past away
so that we can work.

29:09.814 --> 29:11.649
Except the past isn't in the past.

29:11.716 --> 29:14.119
- It's in this room.
- I assure you that isn't the case.

29:14.185 --> 29:15.787
Prove it. Buy the farmhouse.

29:15.854 --> 29:19.057
That makes no sense.
We don't have any time to go there.

29:19.124 --> 29:21.659
Okay, then buy something closer to work.

29:21.726 --> 29:24.462
If that's too much,
buy a freakin' ice cream cone, anything.

29:24.529 --> 29:25.763
What is that gonna prove?

29:25.830 --> 29:27.532
It proves that you've finally moved on.

29:28.900 --> 29:29.901
But you can't...

29:30.535 --> 29:34.172
Because then it would feel
like you were cheating, somehow.

29:34.739 --> 29:38.309
Look, I get it. Simone,
she was brilliant, and a saint, and...

29:38.376 --> 29:39.511
Simone was no saint.

29:39.577 --> 29:41.579
She was loved far and wide.

29:41.646 --> 29:42.680
She was weak.

29:43.615 --> 29:48.019
Yeah... It was stage four cancer.
But there were treatments, okay?

29:48.086 --> 29:51.089
She could have fought,
she could have lived a little bit longer,

29:51.156 --> 29:52.724
she could have found a cure.

29:52.790 --> 29:56.427
- She refused treatment?
- She didn't want to fight.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.231
This woman
that lived larger than life, she was...

30:03.434 --> 30:05.069
In the end, she was just a coward.

30:06.004 --> 30:06.938
She begged me.

30:08.873 --> 30:11.709
She kept... begging me.

30:13.611 --> 30:14.846
She begged you for what?

30:19.117 --> 30:21.486
She wanted me to help her
put an end to it.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.589
I refused. She kept at it.

30:27.192 --> 30:29.894
She just... kept at it, and...

30:35.533 --> 30:36.501
I...

30:39.037 --> 30:40.605
I gave her what she wanted.

30:41.239 --> 30:42.173
You...

30:44.576 --> 30:45.510
I...

30:46.177 --> 30:47.612
I cranked up her pain meds.

30:50.748 --> 30:51.883
Who was gonna know?

31:00.825 --> 31:01.960
Listen.

31:06.164 --> 31:07.565
Do you think that Tiffany

31:07.632 --> 31:10.268
would still be encouraging me
to spend this money

31:10.335 --> 31:11.502
if she knew the truth?

31:12.870 --> 31:13.905
I'm so sorry.

31:15.173 --> 31:16.407
How do I undo that?

31:17.842 --> 31:20.511
- How do I fix it?
- You can't. You can't.

31:21.279 --> 31:23.314
Okay? You can't. You can't.

31:24.282 --> 31:26.517
But it's okay. It's okay.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.688
She was ready, she was suffering,

31:30.755 --> 31:34.158
and you did the most loving thing
someone could do.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.494
You gave her peace.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.531
And it's okay.

32:33.751 --> 32:34.686
Hi, what's up?

32:35.853 --> 32:38.423
I've got some bad news
about our prime time special.

32:39.424 --> 32:41.459
We lost Michelle Obama as a guest.

32:42.393 --> 32:43.361
Okay...

32:45.063 --> 32:47.532
Let's regroup.
We're still after Beyoncé, right?

32:47.598 --> 32:49.600
Well, we lost Michelle Obama

32:49.667 --> 32:53.204
'cause Oprah found out about our special,
and she kicked into high gear

32:53.271 --> 32:56.207
and decided to do her own interview
and prime time special,

32:56.708 --> 32:58.009
all about black women.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.177
She picked our pocket.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.846
And, by the way, it was Pete.

33:02.714 --> 33:03.648
Pete?

33:04.215 --> 33:06.484
I spoke to an executive I know
over at Harpo,

33:06.551 --> 33:09.253
and he told me that Pete traded
all the inside information

33:09.320 --> 33:12.590
on our special for a cushy job
at that new streaming service.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.192
He knew a good thing when he saw it.

33:14.258 --> 33:15.259
Shit.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.296
We all came together
to take out Pete and...

33:18.363 --> 33:19.597
He got the final word.

33:25.603 --> 33:28.606
Pre-making the kids' lunches?
Amika is not available again?

33:29.140 --> 33:30.942
I enrolled the kids into daycare.

33:31.809 --> 33:32.777
Daycare?

33:33.211 --> 33:34.445
They start in the morning.

33:35.279 --> 33:37.982
Our childcare agreement
was great in theory.

33:38.049 --> 33:40.351
But it came down to me
depending on somebody

33:40.418 --> 33:42.420
who wasn't in it,
so I gotta fend for myself.

33:42.487 --> 33:44.922
You can't help anyone
who doesn't wanna help themselves.

33:46.758 --> 33:47.892
That used to be me.

33:47.959 --> 33:51.129
I was thinking that one man or another
could solve all my problems,

33:51.195 --> 33:54.031
and then I thought I found the answer
in sisterhood empowerment,

33:54.899 --> 33:57.268
but now I guess
I gotta do it all on my own.

33:57.335 --> 34:00.071
Well, it's called growing up.
We all have to do it.

34:00.405 --> 34:02.073
Yeah, you too.

34:27.198 --> 34:28.699
Tough business we're in, isn't it?

34:30.735 --> 34:31.836
I'll survive.

34:33.271 --> 34:34.272
We'll survive.

34:36.007 --> 34:39.477
And when I'm EP,
we'll do... 20 nightly specials.

34:41.012 --> 34:41.979
Thanks.

34:56.494 --> 34:58.863
Have you seen
what Dani's supporters are tweeting?

35:09.540 --> 35:11.576
They really hated
her interview with Marci.

35:12.343 --> 35:15.580
She showed some understanding,
and they ate her for lunch.

35:35.633 --> 35:36.601
Hi.

35:38.002 --> 35:39.003
I wanted to

35:40.171 --> 35:42.173
apologize for my behavior
the other night.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.207
No need.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.677
You know,
I'm just over the moon about Mary Jane.

35:47.111 --> 35:48.546
She's the real deal, isn't she?

35:49.080 --> 35:50.081
She is.

35:50.414 --> 35:51.482
You're gonna marry her.

35:53.017 --> 35:56.420
Will you ever stop
trying to marry me off?

35:56.487 --> 35:57.922
I just want you to be happy.

36:00.191 --> 36:01.359
Do you love her?

36:02.994 --> 36:04.028
It's all very new.

36:05.530 --> 36:06.464
And I do.

36:08.232 --> 36:10.468
Would you still love her
if she wasn't the anchor?

36:11.168 --> 36:13.404
What if she wanted
to quit her job tomorrow?

36:13.471 --> 36:14.505
I love her,

36:14.906 --> 36:16.007
not what she does.

36:16.073 --> 36:17.742
Okay, but what about her success?

36:18.376 --> 36:20.111
Simone worried about that with you.

36:20.177 --> 36:22.179
Simone was much more ambitious
than I was.

36:22.246 --> 36:23.281
Maybe,

36:23.681 --> 36:28.019
but I think you're the one
still trying to prove something.

36:37.562 --> 36:38.563
You sure it's okay?

36:39.163 --> 36:40.398
Yeah, it's fine.

36:40.464 --> 36:42.466
You can put your bag
down in the family room.

36:44.201 --> 36:45.436
Is everything okay?

36:45.503 --> 36:48.239
A pipe burst in Javon's building.
The mattress is soaked.

36:48.306 --> 36:51.309
I told him he could stay here tonight
if that's okay with you.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.311
Yeah, but doesn't he have any family?

36:53.377 --> 36:54.545
He's not welcome there.

36:58.583 --> 36:59.550
You know...

37:01.652 --> 37:02.954
I've been meaning to say...

37:05.356 --> 37:07.058
I'm sorry for how I've been lately.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.028
You know,
it's hard to see you in pain, son.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.598
But I was gonna wait
till you were ready to talk.

37:13.998 --> 37:14.999
Yeah.

37:16.033 --> 37:18.569
You know, they say
you can't choose your family.

37:19.437 --> 37:20.404
But you...

37:21.839 --> 37:23.074
You actually did choose me.

37:25.276 --> 37:26.544
You made a big sacrifice.

37:28.379 --> 37:29.747
That's the kind of man you are.

37:30.147 --> 37:32.049
I never regretted a second of it.

37:33.317 --> 37:35.186
Even though I gave you
plenty of reasons to.

37:36.420 --> 37:37.321
It's okay.

37:39.023 --> 37:40.424
That's called family.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.643
Thank you for coming.

38:00.544 --> 38:02.647
I know how much
this special meant to you.

38:03.347 --> 38:06.550
I should warn you that Ty and Aaliyah
are coming over any minute.

38:07.051 --> 38:10.421
- We're gonna drown our sorrows together.
- It's okay. I only need a minute.

38:10.488 --> 38:12.990
You sure you don't wanna stay
for a girls and gay game night?

38:13.557 --> 38:14.625
I think I'm good.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.962
I wanted you to know that I decided
not to give away my money.

38:19.296 --> 38:21.732
Your money? Not Simone's?

38:21.799 --> 38:23.734
No, it's my money. It's all mine.

38:26.704 --> 38:29.240
And we're gonna decide
what to do with it, together.

38:31.776 --> 38:33.244
- Are you sure?
- I am.

38:40.551 --> 38:42.820
An anteater? A walrus?

38:42.887 --> 38:44.155
- It's slimy.
- A snake?

38:44.221 --> 38:45.756
This turns into a butterfly.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.158
- A moth?
- It has a bunch of legs.

38:47.892 --> 38:49.527
- And it likes leaves.
- A centipede?

38:49.593 --> 38:50.795
A centipede? A rabbit?

38:51.328 --> 38:54.098
What? Rabbits turn into butterflies?

38:54.165 --> 38:56.567
It's what a butterfly is
before becoming a butterfly.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.202
- A larvae?
- It has a shield.

38:59.070 --> 39:01.872
It bursts out of its cocoon,
and then it becomes a butterfly.

39:01.939 --> 39:03.574
- A baby butterfly?
- Lord.

39:05.142 --> 39:06.243
A caterpillar.

39:06.310 --> 39:07.611
- Man!
- Girl, you suck.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.280
- Give me the phone.
- Come sit down.

39:09.346 --> 39:11.015
- I'll tell you how to do it.
- It's okay.

39:11.449 --> 39:12.783
- It's ringing.
- Who is it?

39:12.850 --> 39:14.752
- It's Garrett.
- No, no.

39:14.819 --> 39:16.620
- I don't wanna talk to him now.
- Okay.

39:16.687 --> 39:17.955
Well, you do it.

39:18.656 --> 39:20.057
You have to talk to him.

39:25.162 --> 39:26.997
<i>- This is Mary Jane Paul.
- Hi, Mary Jane.</i>

39:28.799 --> 39:30.234
Yeah, yeah, hold on just a second.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.608
Callin' this late,
it's gotta be important.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.512
Okay. Thanks, Garrett.

39:45.349 --> 39:47.284
- Are you okay?
- What did Garrett want?

39:47.351 --> 39:48.319
Nothing.

39:49.320 --> 39:52.323
Your boss called you at 10 p.m.
on a school night for nothing?

39:52.389 --> 39:54.725
Am I gonna walk
into a shit storm tomorrow?

39:55.526 --> 39:56.894
Don't lie to your publicist.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.829
He feels bad about me losing the special.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.432
- As he should.
- So he did something for me.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.068
Which was...?

40:04.135 --> 40:06.904
He convinced the brass
to give me a vote on his replacement.

40:09.206 --> 40:10.174
Wait.

40:10.775 --> 40:13.377
So you have to choose
between Kara and Justin?

40:13.444 --> 40:16.947
Either my best friend or my boyfriend
is gonna end up hating me.
