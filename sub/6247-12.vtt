00:01.080 --> 00:04.311
<i>7:30 right now. Coming up, a
recap of a disturbing story...</i>

00:07.800 --> 00:10.268
<i>The remains have not been identified.</i>

00:10.360 --> 00:13.238
<i>There's no word as to whether
foul play is suspected.</i>

00:13.320 --> 00:17.711
Dale, the word most repeated by the
young witnesses we spoke to: horror,

00:17.800 --> 00:20.439
as in "it looked like a horror movie".

00:20.520 --> 00:23.796
Now we're going to go to another break.

00:23.880 --> 00:29.796
I hate press cases. More than three cameras
show, some detective kicks it to his captain

00:29.880 --> 00:32.269
who kicks it up to the
chief and to the FBI.

00:32.360 --> 00:35.636
And you, bang, kick it down to
me. Which I thank you for, sir.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.712
<i>I want this closed. I don't
want to pick up Sunday's Post</i>

00:38.800 --> 00:43.396
and read, "Church kids find mystery corpse
dressed for Halloween, FBI clueless. "

00:43.480 --> 00:47.359
I guarantee you won't read
that, sir. OK, I'm on it. Bones.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.908
- I got here as soon as I could.
- Yeah, great.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.471
- I pull you from anything important? - A
9,600-year-old Caucasoid female skeleton.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.949
It was found in the
Kunlun mountains in China.

00:57.040 --> 01:00.953
An investigation is under way. I'm
contributing stress-marker analysis.

01:01.040 --> 01:05.431
I think you're gonna find
this very interesting too.

01:10.760 --> 01:11.909
Ooh.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.911
<i>What the hell is he wearing?</i>

01:14.000 --> 01:17.276
It's lightweight. Composite.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.672
Some kind of sexuaI bondage suit. And
there's that bag. That's full of maggots.

01:21.760 --> 01:26.709
That looks like cellulose in there, degraded
from bodily tissues and decomposing fat.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.836
And maggots.

01:30.920 --> 01:34.879
TibiaI fractures and ground
disturbance suggest totaI body impact.

01:34.960 --> 01:39.112
<i>- OK, so did he jump or was he pushed?
- That's what we have to figure out.</i>

01:39.200 --> 01:43.751
We can take the skeleton in. Give
you a report maybe after next week.

01:43.840 --> 01:49.631
No. Just tell me if I'm looking at a
murder. Maybe, you know, pull a quick ID?

01:49.720 --> 01:55.636
- Don't use your charm smile on me.
- What? It's a mark of respect, that's all.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.318
EpiphyseaI union with the
diaphysis on the ankles

01:59.400 --> 02:02.790
suggests the victim was
between 14 and 18 years old.

02:02.880 --> 02:07.396
1.6m tall, of very slight build, suggesting
he was at the younger end of the scale.

02:07.480 --> 02:11.314
That tracks with the bag. The
cellulose we found is a graphic noveI.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.311
- A what?
- It's a comic book.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.992
I never read comic books.

02:15.080 --> 02:18.231
Really? I had you pegged
for a graphic noveI nut.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.790
The face and craniaI
vault are badly fractured.

02:21.880 --> 02:26.158
Blows have sent fracture lines between
the mid-frontaI and anterior buttresses.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.629
<i>- Why?
- Star Wars, Star Trek,</i>

02:28.720 --> 02:30.711
<i>Stargate, Battlestar Galactica.</i>

02:30.800 --> 02:33.109
Focusing, gentlemen.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.395
Conclusion, a brutaI assault killed him.

02:35.480 --> 02:39.189
He was dropped after
he was already dead.

02:39.280 --> 02:42.875
His killer wanted it
to look like a suicide.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.758
Get his dentals into the NCIC,
see if we can find a match.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.070
Zack, call Stockholm and Beijing.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.914
Our research data on the other
thing is going to be delayed.

02:54.360 --> 02:58.353
<i>- It's Warren Granger, age 17.
- 17. Small for his age.</i>

02:58.440 --> 03:00.908
Home-schooled. GED
obtained last summer.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.711
Mother and stepfather reported him missing
from this very block two months ago.

03:06.800 --> 03:12.352
Bones, if you want to sit this part out, I
know you got some ancient Chinese bones waiting.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.635
No. I'm on this now.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.828
<i>It looks like every other house.</i>

03:23.920 --> 03:27.708
<i>Every family has its secrets, Bones.</i>

03:30.360 --> 03:32.954
This was Warren's room.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.391
No one's has been up here since
the detective looked it over.

03:37.480 --> 03:40.552
The news said there was
hardly anything left of him.

03:43.880 --> 03:48.749
Can you think of anyone who might've
wanted to harm Warren in any way?

03:48.840 --> 03:53.356
He was always by himself.
No friends, no enemies.

03:53.800 --> 03:58.112
Spent all his time up here
with his comic books and toys.

03:58.200 --> 04:02.398
He was a lonely kid. Died
before he even had a life.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.233
I really thought he had just run away.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.437
We tried.

04:12.520 --> 04:16.991
Tried to get him out of this
place into some kind of reaI life.

04:17.079 --> 04:19.753
I even got him ajob
at the bowling alley,

04:19.839 --> 04:21.591
but...

04:21.680 --> 04:25.468
he just spent all his
money on this... stuff.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.669
Unbelievable.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.636
Quite the collection of comic books.

04:34.720 --> 04:39.430
Hodgins said that the cellulose
mass was a graphic noveI.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.911
He sent it to Angela for
analysis and recovery.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.797
- Sweet.
- Sweet?

04:45.880 --> 04:51.318
<i>This is Batman number 127 featuring "The
Hammer of Thor". This is worth about $300.</i>

04:51.400 --> 04:54.710
- Booth, are you a nerd?
- First of all, you mean "geek".

04:54.800 --> 04:58.713
And, no, I'm not. It's quite normaI for
an American male to read comic books.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.917
I can't believe you have
anything in common with Warren.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.470
Oh, you mean isolated with
an inner secret life? No.

05:05.560 --> 05:08.074
<i>Hey, I'd say you were more like Warren.</i>

05:12.360 --> 05:17.150
Zack discovered some significant hairline
parry fractures on the right and left ulnae.

05:17.240 --> 05:20.277
- That's his arms.
- I know ulna means forearm.

05:20.360 --> 05:24.638
I pay attention. I also know that parry
fracture means the kid fought back.

05:24.720 --> 05:28.395
Small stature, a geek,
and he fought back.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.438
He also got thrown from a roof.

05:33.640 --> 05:38.111
There's nothing but games on here.
There's no journaI, there's no documents.

05:38.200 --> 05:42.830
Nothing personaI. What did he do at
his desk? I mean, there's a light.

05:42.920 --> 05:47.232
The rug's worn. He used this
area for something. What was it?

05:47.320 --> 05:50.596
Probably where he read his comic books.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:59.400 --> 06:04.633
I think Warren sat here and wrote
longhand with a ballpoint pen.

06:04.720 --> 06:08.076
That's pretty retro for a geek.

06:08.160 --> 06:13.029
<i>Well, at least we know where he got
the idea for a costume. Citizen 14.</i>

06:13.120 --> 06:15.111
<i>A superhero.</i>

06:48.360 --> 06:54.799
Hodgins dried out and separated the pages. I
digitised them and adjusted for ink seepage.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.953
<i>- Was this printed commercially?
- No. It's handmade.</i>

06:59.040 --> 07:02.510
- That's what he was writing.
- A comic book starring himself.

07:02.600 --> 07:06.229
A shy adolescent young man
renders himself as a superhero.

07:06.320 --> 07:10.518
Alone in that room all the time. Maybe
Warren got consumed by his own fantasy.

07:10.600 --> 07:14.354
- You think he was out fighting crime?
- Well, the boy got beaten to a pulp

07:14.440 --> 07:17.750
wearing his superhero outfit in
the heaviest crime area of DC.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.796
As you know, being a writer yourself,

07:19.880 --> 07:24.078
Warren's comic book could be infused
with his reaI-life fears and conflicts.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.276
Especially in the case of an adolescent.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.669
- Can you retrieve any more of this?
- Yeah.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.115
Fine. What's our next step?

07:31.200 --> 07:35.113
Oh, we'll go see if Warren had any
friends his mother didn't know about.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.435
Wait. Warren Granger was the
skeleton corpse those kids found?

07:41.520 --> 07:44.353
Yeah. Sounds like you were close.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.193
How long was he laying
there all dead like that?

07:47.280 --> 07:50.716
<i>- For a while.
- How well did you know Warren, Mr Ellis?</i>

07:50.800 --> 07:53.598
He came in here all the time.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.955
You know, he... he knew his stuff.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.076
He was a nice kid.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.634
- Really nice guy.
- Something you're not telling us?

08:02.720 --> 08:05.188
- What do you mean?
- You seem a little nervous.

08:05.280 --> 08:09.319
Well, you just told me that someone
I know is this rotting skeletaI corpse

08:09.400 --> 08:12.312
<i>that's been all over the news.</i>

08:12.400 --> 08:14.834
Is there a party upstairs?

08:14.920 --> 08:19.789
Oh, it's the, uh, Doomsday Group.
I rent it out Thursday nights.

08:22.160 --> 08:26.551
Hey, wait. Um, Warren
was actually one of them.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.553
Oh. That's a handy thing to remember.
Anything else you forget to mention?

08:30.640 --> 08:33.359
No, that's... that's it, I think.

08:42.559 --> 08:45.552
<i>- I can't take that away.
- We can't break out of...</i>

08:45.640 --> 08:48.200
Excuse me. This is a
private function. Goodbye.

08:48.280 --> 08:52.751
Go ahead. Don't let me stop you
from... What are you doing, exactly?

08:52.840 --> 08:57.595
Guys, this is actually a reaI live
woman. Something you don't see often.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.274
And like I said, this is
a private function, so...

09:00.360 --> 09:03.511
It's the FBI. All right? Turn
it off for a minute, please.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.716
<i>FBI?</i>

09:05.800 --> 09:09.270
I'm Yasutani the Terrible.
I speak for this clan.

09:09.960 --> 09:14.875
OK, well, we'd like to ask you a few
questions if you're not too, uh... busy.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.428
The costumes, the sociaI awkwardness,

09:17.520 --> 09:21.399
the active fantasy life
- the victim would fit into this subgrouping.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.916
OK, hey, Mr Yakatori the Horrible.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.434
- What's your reaI name?
- Jeremy Kuznetsky.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.954
Do any of you people
know Warren Granger?

09:30.040 --> 09:33.953
- Something happened to Warren?
- Warren's dead. He was murdered.

09:34.040 --> 09:38.033
No, I never said anything about him
being murdered. Neither did the press.

09:38.120 --> 09:43.035
Obviously if you're the FBI he was murdered.
You don't investigate people hit by a bus.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.270
OK. When's the last time you saw Warren?

09:45.360 --> 09:48.193
<i>- A couple months ago when he left.
- Left?</i>

09:48.280 --> 09:52.637
Citizen 14 was one of us untiI
he went psycho and bugged out.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.314
- Called us all posers.
- Pathetic fantasists.

09:55.400 --> 10:00.315
- Was he wearing his, um... outfit?
- His identity, yeah.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.233
- Why do you wear these identities?
- For the game.

10:03.320 --> 10:07.108
- How serious do you take it?
- It's only fun if you take it seriously.

10:07.200 --> 10:11.159
- You always play here?
- "Play" is not exactly the right verb, OK?

10:11.240 --> 10:15.392
Shut up! Shut up! Who cares?
Didn't you hear? Warren is dead!

10:15.480 --> 10:17.357
It's OK, Minnow.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.476
- What's your name?
- Blue Minnow.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.836
When I ask your names, I want
the ones your parents gave you.

10:22.920 --> 10:26.469
AbigaiI Zealy. Citizen
14 was my partner.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.597
Is that what you call
Warren? Citizen 14?

10:29.680 --> 10:32.877
Citizen 14 was my partner.
Warren was my friend.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.872
He was a little more than that.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.476
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.758
I don't like to judge an entire subculture,
but those people gave me the creeps.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.035
That's because they are creepy.

10:49.120 --> 10:53.272
What I mean is those kids weren't
your harmless tutor-you-in-math geeks.

10:53.360 --> 10:57.035
They were the, you know,
set-the-schooI-on-fire geeks.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.793
Dark nerds. Columbine nerds.

10:59.880 --> 11:03.668
Columbine? You think Yasutani
the Terrible is capable of murder?

11:03.760 --> 11:06.877
I think they get high,
they play these games,

11:06.960 --> 11:10.999
they lose their grip on reality and
they believe they are these characters.

11:11.080 --> 11:13.799
You mean like Warren,
out fighting crime?

11:13.880 --> 11:17.555
You know, hey, maybe Warren and
that guy, the leader, Yasahama...

11:17.640 --> 11:20.108
- Yasutani the Terrible.
- Yeah.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.031
Maybe him and that guy,

11:22.120 --> 11:25.874
they got into this, you know,
magic fight and it became reaI.

11:25.960 --> 11:31.318
So you're saying it wasn't Warren who was
murdered, it was his character, Citizen 14.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.313
They're so delusionaI they don't
even know they've committed a crime.

11:35.400 --> 11:39.188
I'll get Hodgins to see if there's
any signs of drug use in Warren's hair.

11:40.040 --> 11:44.477
Oh, I managed to get some of the text
back from this paneI. CheerfuI little tyke.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.676
The writer was in pain.

11:47.120 --> 11:50.795
And I don't think it was purely the
adolescent angst of the outsider.

11:50.880 --> 11:54.111
I'd go so far as to say it
wasn't even psychologicaI pain.

11:54.200 --> 11:57.954
He's afraid of actuaI physicaI death.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.235
Can you pull all that from a comic book?

12:00.320 --> 12:03.790
Writers reveaI more of themselves
than they intend on every page.

12:03.880 --> 12:08.032
I never bought all that English 101
stuff. Sometimes a river is just a river.

12:08.120 --> 12:11.271
All due respect, but my
writing is pure fiction.

12:11.360 --> 12:16.195
I fear you reveaI much more of your world
view in your writing than you realise.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.269
Such as?

12:17.360 --> 12:21.751
Such as, archaeologists make good
administrators because they enjoy tedium.

12:21.840 --> 12:26.994
Artists are doomed to a life of loneliness cos
they can't think beyond instant gratification.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.231
Such as, FBI guys are hot and
Angela wants to have sex with me.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.878
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:33.280 --> 12:37.273
AII I'm suggesting is that while Dr
Goodman goes through Warren's writing,

12:37.360 --> 12:41.592
we should concentrate on the hypotheses
congruent with forensic evidence.

12:41.680 --> 12:45.673
I'm going to take another look
at Warren Granger's remains.

12:45.760 --> 12:49.753
In the last 24 hours I've read severaI
dozen comic books and graphic novels.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.229
Did Hodgins find any sign of drug use?

12:52.320 --> 12:54.311
No.

12:54.400 --> 12:58.279
They're quite interesting.
The graphic novels especially.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.635
After you clean the
bones, look for scoring

13:00.720 --> 13:03.871
on the occipitaI condyle
and the inferior nuchaI line.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.633
They're basically a
retelling of the Greek myths

13:06.720 --> 13:09.757
with all superheroes
standing in for Hercules.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.910
Half god, half human.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.911
OK, be very carefuI here.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.189
X
- ray shows fragmentation of the cervicaI vertebrae consistent with sharp force trauma.

13:20.280 --> 13:25.718
Invulnerability, super strength,
heightened senses, telekinesis...

13:26.680 --> 13:30.275
I'd love to have some of those powers.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.749
Why?

13:32.840 --> 13:38.631
- I-I don't really know. Is that an odd
desire? - Why fantasise? You're smart.

13:38.720 --> 13:42.998
In some ways my intelligence is a
handicap. Well, for one thing, I'm weird.

13:43.080 --> 13:47.790
For another, I tend to make people
feeI stupid and they resent me for it.

13:47.880 --> 13:51.350
I suspect it's the same for superpowers.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.548
The victim was stabbed
at the base of the spine.

13:56.640 --> 13:59.552
The spinaI cord was severed.
That's what killed him.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.518
I'll clean the bones and try
to match a weapon to the damage.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.910
Which will make you a reaI
hero in the reaI world.

14:07.880 --> 14:12.476
<i>In this restored paneI from the
second and finaI volume of Citizen 14</i>

14:12.560 --> 14:16.519
we begin to see a female
presence, beautifuI, ethereaI,

14:16.600 --> 14:19.319
which he calls the Opalescence.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.960
A girI he literally can't approach.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.953
What if Warren was only...

14:26.040 --> 14:29.874
you know, supplying his
own masturbatory materials?

14:29.960 --> 14:34.272
Yes. Lonely adolescent boy. But the
story moves beyond that dimension.

14:34.360 --> 14:38.194
Here we see the idolised
female Opalescence

14:38.280 --> 14:42.876
cowering before a dark male figure
referred to only as the Twisted.

14:42.960 --> 14:47.875
So Citizen 14 wants to rescue
the Opalescence from the Twisted.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.793
Could this be Warren's
mother and stepfather?

14:50.880 --> 14:56.113
There are elements of romantic
love. This girI surrounded by blue...

14:58.760 --> 15:04.312
You know, they did mention that one of
those comic-book geeks was a blue girI.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.914
I'd say she's definitely
worth questioning.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.551
<i>- Blue Minnow. That's your alter ego.
- AbigaiI Zealy is my alter ego.</i>

15:11.640 --> 15:14.916
Did you, AbigaiI, have a
relationship with Warren Granger?

15:15.000 --> 15:18.595
Or did the Blue Minnow have a
relationship with Citizen 14?

15:18.680 --> 15:22.559
- Or any combination thereof?
- Neither.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.677
Warren had a girlfriend.
At CapitaI BowI.

15:25.760 --> 15:29.799
- What's the girlfriend's name, Abby?
- He never told us her name.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.519
It was just a physicaI thing

15:32.600 --> 15:35.751
and... and it was almost over.

15:35.840 --> 15:39.435
Warren and I had a connection.
He couldn't deny that.

15:39.520 --> 15:44.435
Before he disappeared, he gave me
his entire NeiI Gaiman collection,

15:44.520 --> 15:46.556
his favourite work beside his own.

15:46.640 --> 15:51.555
In his own work he describes a
woman known as the Opalescence.

15:51.640 --> 15:55.076
Do you believe that's
supposed to be you?

15:55.160 --> 15:57.390
What do you think?

15:57.480 --> 16:00.517
We think it's another girI entirely.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.153
Does that bother you?

16:05.240 --> 16:07.310
OK...

16:07.400 --> 16:10.790
Maybe the others told
you I'm obsessed. I know.

16:10.880 --> 16:14.111
Because they never
got Warren like I did.

16:14.200 --> 16:18.159
He was right. They are posers.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.913
- But Warren wasn't?
- Warren believed.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.152
He believed in truth. He
believed in doing what was right.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.276
<i>He was Citizen 14.</i>

16:27.360 --> 16:29.351
Citizen 14 is reaI.

16:29.440 --> 16:34.958
- Warren didn't fit in with the others?
- I just said! Warren was better!

16:35.760 --> 16:38.115
He was a really nice guy.

16:38.200 --> 16:41.431
Were you aware that Jeremy Kuznetsky

16:41.520 --> 16:44.512
and Kenneth Vert

16:44.600 --> 16:46.477
have police records?

16:46.560 --> 16:48.357
Yeah.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.830
It's nothing interesting, though.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.071
It's, like, vandalism and trespassing.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.196
You can't take them seriously.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.078
- What, as criminals?
- As anything.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.833
OK. Well, what would be
interesting as a crime?

17:02.920 --> 17:05.309
Something that took courage.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.039
Something that meant something.

17:08.119 --> 17:10.076
Like murder?

17:10.160 --> 17:12.355
Yeah. Like murder.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.348
Warren Granger on the night
he died, wearing his costume.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.431
Start the sequence.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.990
Cause of death was a
severed spinaI cord.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.998
- We can rule out AbigaiI Zealy.
- How do you figure?

17:35.080 --> 17:38.709
AbigaiI doesn't have enough strength
to sever Warren's spinaI cord.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.679
What about his stepdad? Or the
other kids at the comic shop?

17:42.760 --> 17:46.639
Well, if the physicality of the
murderer is between 5'10 and 6'1,

17:46.720 --> 17:50.030
I'd say yes to them all,
depending on the weapon.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.589
What had he done to
make somebody so angry?

17:56.680 --> 18:00.958
Zack's cleaning the bones now. Maybe
we'll find something that we've missed.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.195
<i>- What are you reading?
- I'm doing research.</i>

18:05.280 --> 18:09.558
- By reading a comic book?
- Intensely allegoricaI modern myths.

18:09.640 --> 18:12.393
- You're reading Bugs Bunny.
- On the surface, yes.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.836
But if you dig deeper, the
subtext becomes apparent.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.037
The conflict is representative
of the Darwinian struggle

18:19.120 --> 18:21.395
between avians and
mammals for dominance.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.438
Based on Bugs giving Daffy
a cigar made out of dynamite?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.317
Yeah.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.549
And then here he
explodes, but not really.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.153
- You have a problem, my man.
- What?

18:34.240 --> 18:38.870
- It looks like you degraded the bones.
- Impossible. It's only a 4% peroxide solution.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.635
Then what's that bubbling
and pitting on the periosteum?

18:42.720 --> 18:48.716
- A 4% solution wouldn't cause that.
- Is it some kind of systemic deterioration?

18:51.840 --> 18:56.311
<i>- Intertrochanteric crest is eaten away.
- What do you think it is?</i>

18:56.400 --> 18:58.595
This kid was sick.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.313
- You smell that?
- Yes, I do.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.277
You know what that is, Bones?

19:13.360 --> 19:15.351
Wax, popcorn...

19:16.400 --> 19:18.038
feet, deodorant...

19:18.120 --> 19:23.035
- That is America, Bones.
- You keep your bowling ball in the car?

19:23.120 --> 19:28.717
Oh, I figure we ask a few questions about
Warren Granger, maybe bowI a few frames.

19:28.800 --> 19:32.793
- Nothing like sport to take the edge off...
- This is not a sport.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.714
- How do you figure?
- There's no physicaI benefit, so it's like golf.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.950
It's not a sport. It's an activity.

19:39.040 --> 19:43.875
Could you please, maybe just for once,
try not to piss everyone off around you?

19:43.960 --> 19:46.235
Yeah. Sorry.

19:46.320 --> 19:49.073
Are you good at this... sport?

19:49.160 --> 19:52.038
My average is over 200,
less than two opens per game.

19:52.120 --> 19:56.033
One match I had 211
strikes out of 431 shots.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.192
- 29 opens in 39 games.
- What does that mean?

19:59.280 --> 20:02.272
- I won bowling awards.
- I won the Marshall H Dixon Award

20:02.360 --> 20:05.557
for my paper on George Romanes
and physiologicaI selection.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.552
My God, it's like we
lead paralleI lives.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.996
- You need shoes?
- Yeah. Uh, looking for the manager.

20:12.520 --> 20:15.478
Ted McGruder. FBI, huh?

20:15.560 --> 20:18.518
We're investigating the death
of one of your employees.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.238
Warren Granger.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.151
Warren?

20:22.240 --> 20:25.789
He didn't show up for his paycheck.
I thought he found anotherjob

20:25.880 --> 20:30.271
and didn't want to give notice. He's
weird like that. Good kid, though.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.112
<i>Bye-bye!</i>

20:32.200 --> 20:34.634
Aw, don't pout!

20:34.720 --> 20:37.792
Ted, I talked to them but
they just keep giving me lip.

20:37.880 --> 20:42.431
Luce, these people are with the FBI.
They're here about Warren Granger.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.671
- Warren? What about him?
- He's deceased.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.399
Oh, my God.

20:48.480 --> 20:52.996
- I told you he didn't quit.
- I was wrong. This is my wife, Lucy.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.753
- Sorry.
- That's OK.

20:55.840 --> 21:01.119
<i>- How often do those kids come in here?
- Those jokers? Weekends, mostly.</i>

21:01.200 --> 21:04.590
They used to come in a lot more
but in these crazy costumes.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.992
I told them I'd allow it
on Halloween but that's it.

21:09.080 --> 21:14.518
Warren's girlfriend here? We were informed
that Warren's girlfriend worked here.

21:14.600 --> 21:18.195
If you ever met Warren you'd know
he's not the girlfriend type of kid.

21:18.280 --> 21:22.398
There was a girI who came
by to see him sometimes.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.279
Yeah. Yeah, that's her. I
- I don't know her name,

21:27.360 --> 21:30.352
but I don't think Warren
was all that glad to see her.

21:30.440 --> 21:33.876
If she called, he'd ask me to
tell her that he wasn't here.

21:33.960 --> 21:34.949
Brennan.

21:35.040 --> 21:41.149
- Maybe he was just trying to dodge her.
- Excuse me just one moment, please.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.390
OK, slow down, Zack, and repeat that.

21:43.480 --> 21:48.679
Hypercellularity with totaI effacement
of the marrow space. Osteoblasts at 26%.

21:48.760 --> 21:52.070
OK. Good work, Zack. Keep
working on the weapon ID.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.390
I take it we're not
getting any bowling in?

21:54.480 --> 22:00.271
Zack said that if Warren hadn't been
murdered two months ago, he'd be dead by now.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.353
When you said Warren was
sick, you meant leukaemia?

22:05.440 --> 22:06.509
Yes.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.273
But by the time he was
11, he was in remission.

22:09.360 --> 22:15.230
The hypercellular activity I saw is
only present in advanced cancer cases.

22:15.320 --> 22:17.959
He must have been very ill.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.871
You didn't notice?

22:19.960 --> 22:23.270
We tried to be there for Warren,
but he wouldn't let us in.

22:23.360 --> 22:27.319
Right when you thought you'd built
a bridge of trust, he'd quit on you.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.994
He quit trying to face reality.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.478
Maybe your son didn't want
you to have to face it.

22:35.560 --> 22:40.315
I mean, he knew his situation was dire,
and he decided to tough it out on his own.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.952
Yes. He saw what it did
to me the first time.

22:46.040 --> 22:50.909
It's not that he quit. It's
that he didn't want me to suffer.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.629
You said her son didn't tell her
he was sick to make her feeI better.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.393
- You don't believe that?
- People don't do that.

23:05.480 --> 23:08.313
- So you told her that to make her feeI better?
- Right.

23:08.400 --> 23:15.033
You just did what you said people don't
do. I wonder why he didn't tell his mother.

23:15.120 --> 23:18.510
Maybe he was caught up in the
romance of being a dying superhero.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.194
Adolescent angst, all that.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.272
<i>What do you really think?</i>

23:25.240 --> 23:28.710
The truth is, I think the boy
was looking how to be a man.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.598
All on his own. He was
doing the best that he could.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.910
Heroes don't whine about being sick.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.391
- Something like that. Poor kid.
- Did they know about the leukaemia?

23:38.480 --> 23:40.869
- No. He kept it a secret.
- Tough guy, huh?

23:40.960 --> 23:45.033
You were right. The kid knew he was
facing death. This changes motivation.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.759
- The killer's motivation?
- Warren Granger's.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.035
He was emboldened by
knowing he would die.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.476
- He went looking for a fight.
- He went looking for the Twisted.

23:53.560 --> 24:00.238
Wait. Wait. We are allowing the comic-book
story to generate too many hypotheses.

24:00.320 --> 24:03.118
I only heard the "go get
the bad guy" hypothesis.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.316
<i>- It's too generaI.
- Yes.</i>

24:05.400 --> 24:09.154
Perhaps the Opalescence
represented Warren's better nature

24:09.240 --> 24:13.950
and the Twisted was a reflection
of his darker sexuaI impulses -

24:14.040 --> 24:17.874
a theme I assume is
common in teenage fiction.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.951
And the drawings...

24:21.440 --> 24:23.556
Hello? Bones?

24:23.640 --> 24:25.949
The drawings.

24:26.040 --> 24:30.477
Warren wrote the comics, but there was
no evidence that he knew how to draw.

24:30.560 --> 24:34.189
Dr Brennan, I found an extra
piece of bone I can't account for.

24:34.520 --> 24:36.829
Someone else drew the comic.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.189
Stew Ellis.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.475
- What about him?
- Look.

24:41.560 --> 24:46.588
Warren Granger wrote this comic
book but it was drawn by Stew Ellis.

24:49.720 --> 24:53.429
I told you, I knew Warren from the
store, OK? He was a serious investor.

24:53.520 --> 24:56.114
- Did he owe you money, Stew?
- What?

24:56.200 --> 25:01.558
Was it creative differences or was
it you just didn't get enough credit?

25:02.560 --> 25:05.199
<i>No, it was none of that.</i>

25:05.280 --> 25:09.034
Look, why didn't you tell me you were
partners when I asked you earlier?

25:09.120 --> 25:14.035
Cos we had a big argument. I didn't
want you to think I had a motive.

25:14.120 --> 25:18.079
OK. What did you argue
about? AbigaiI Zealy?

25:18.160 --> 25:22.278
- No, man. Just merchandising.
- You argued about merchandising?

25:22.360 --> 25:25.432
Yeah. Warren thought he
deserved 70% for the concept,

25:25.520 --> 25:27.909
but I think since I
did the drawings, I...

25:28.000 --> 25:30.389
- Do you have a publisher?
- No.

25:30.480 --> 25:36.715
And now we never will. Look, if you think
that I killed Warren, I'm not that stupid, man.

25:36.800 --> 25:42.511
- So, who do you think killed Warren?
- I... I don't know. Definitely not me, OK?

25:42.600 --> 25:46.673
Well, Stew, as of this moment, you're
the prime suspect in Warren's murder.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.910
<i>Why?</i>

25:49.000 --> 25:53.471
You lied about your relationship with Warren.
If I were you, I would think really hard

25:53.560 --> 25:56.791
if there's anything
else you haven't told me.

25:56.880 --> 25:59.155
All right. Abby.

25:59.240 --> 26:01.879
Abby?

26:03.720 --> 26:05.153
Triangle.

26:05.240 --> 26:10.030
I hooked up with her a few times,
but she was obsessed with Warren.

26:10.120 --> 26:15.114
- So, you did argue about her?
- No, man. Warren never wanted Abby.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.676
It made you jealous that she wanted him?

26:17.760 --> 26:20.877
Dude, Abby's cute in a
chick geek kind of way,

26:20.960 --> 26:24.236
but she's not that kind of Betty
you go to the death chamber for.

26:24.320 --> 26:27.517
OK. You're one of those guys
who's way too good at Iying.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.637
Dude, I'm an artist. What do you want?

26:31.680 --> 26:37.755
I found the extra piece of bone lodged
here in the odontoid process of C2.

26:39.720 --> 26:45.670
I
- I went through all the chipping and damage again but I can't find where it came from.

26:45.760 --> 26:49.309
<i>- It's not from the cervicaI vertebrae.
- Oh, it's not?</i>

26:49.400 --> 26:53.029
It's from a long bone, probably
the deltoid process of a humerus.

26:53.120 --> 26:57.750
- An arm bone?
- I need you to set up the microtome.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.673
And get me paraffin
and an embedding mould.

27:00.760 --> 27:03.194
- Are you prepping your own bone slide?
- Yes.

27:03.280 --> 27:06.317
- Usually I do that for you.
- This is a tough one, Zack.

27:06.400 --> 27:10.996
The piece is small and I need to make
sure there's enough left for a DNA sample.

27:11.080 --> 27:13.719
Wait. Warren Granger's
arm bones are complete.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.236
This extra bone fragment
didn't come from Warren Granger.

27:17.320 --> 27:20.630
Warren was the victim of a
violent attack. He fought back.

27:20.720 --> 27:24.838
It's possible that during that
struggle he struck his attacker

27:24.920 --> 27:27.309
with the same weapon
that was used to kill him.

27:27.400 --> 27:32.110
Which means that piece of bone
could've come from his murderer.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.631
What are you doing?

27:43.600 --> 27:47.673
Breathing dissipates static
electricity and makes it easier to cut.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.069
You seem nervous.

27:50.160 --> 27:56.235
If I get this right I'll be able to tell you
the age, sex and race of Warren Granger's killer.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.229
<i>Stew was the artist.</i>

28:00.320 --> 28:05.075
Really? You think he killed
Warren over artistic differences?

28:05.160 --> 28:08.152
- He also had a thing for Abby.
- Wow.

28:08.240 --> 28:12.950
Yeah. For a recluse, Warren Granger,
he had his thumb in a lot of pies.

28:13.040 --> 28:16.828
You said before that
Warren reminded you of me.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.831
You think I'm just like him,

28:18.920 --> 28:24.472
that he hid from life by immersing himself
in a fantasy world where he fought crime,

28:24.560 --> 28:29.873
and I do the same thing, only
I don't have superpowers. I...

28:29.960 --> 28:33.316
- I have science.
- No, Bones, you do fight crime.

28:33.400 --> 28:38.599
It's not a fantasy. As far as any normaI
person is concerned, you do have superpowers.

28:38.680 --> 28:41.114
- You're just saying that.
- I don't do that.

28:41.200 --> 28:46.672
Yes, you do. You lied to Warren
Granger's mother to make her feeI better.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.274
That seems to be your superpower.

28:49.360 --> 28:52.432
Look, this piece of
bone you're analysing,

28:52.520 --> 28:55.751
how did it get lodged
in Warren Granger's neck?

28:55.840 --> 29:00.436
It was deposited by the same
weapon that severed his spinaI cord.

29:00.520 --> 29:03.239
Doesn't make it the killer's bone.

29:05.680 --> 29:08.478
You're thinking a
separate murder victim?

29:08.560 --> 29:10.471
Opalescence?

29:10.560 --> 29:13.518
The woman he loved.

29:13.600 --> 29:16.194
- I don't think she's dead.
- Why?

29:16.280 --> 29:18.316
<i>This is an arm bone.</i>

29:18.400 --> 29:22.757
Has anyone we've seen on this
case been favouring her arm?

29:22.840 --> 29:24.512
Not that I've noticed.

29:24.600 --> 29:28.673
That's because you're
not an anthropologist...

29:29.680 --> 29:32.194
- with superpowers.
- Ha.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.439
<i>That's good.</i>

29:37.720 --> 29:40.314
Oh. Hello.

29:40.400 --> 29:43.551
- Any news about Warren?
- We're still in the initiaI phase.

29:43.640 --> 29:49.272
You didn't happen to keep that last payroll
cheque for Warren that you told me about?

29:49.360 --> 29:52.397
- By law I have to, yeah.
- You mind digging that out for us?

29:52.480 --> 29:54.550
I apologise for the inconvenience.

29:54.640 --> 29:57.438
I guess. It's probably
in the file somewhere.

29:57.520 --> 30:01.718
<i>- What do you need the paycheck for?
- Ah, it's technicaI.</i>

30:01.800 --> 30:03.597
Mrs McGruder,

30:03.680 --> 30:07.468
- what's wrong with your left side?
- Why would you ask me that?

30:07.560 --> 30:12.680
I noticed how you held yourself the last time
I was here. I didn't think anything of it...

30:12.760 --> 30:15.513
- What?
- She wants to know how you hurt yourself.

30:15.600 --> 30:19.798
You walk as though your left ribs are
cracked. Also, you favour your left arm.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.233
Oh! I, um...

30:21.320 --> 30:23.550
I
- I fell on the lanes.

30:23.640 --> 30:25.835
They're very slippery.

30:25.920 --> 30:29.879
Falling would bruise a number of
ribs. You're favouring only one or two.

30:29.960 --> 30:33.077
The type of damage done by a fist.

30:35.080 --> 30:37.640
Look, were you and Warren close?

30:37.720 --> 30:39.756
He was a nice kid.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.870
A really nice kid.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.110
Here it is.

30:45.200 --> 30:49.034
You two want to bowI a few
frames? Got some empty lanes.

30:49.120 --> 30:52.999
- I'll see you in the comic books, buster.
- What?

30:53.080 --> 30:55.469
<i>Thanks. I'll get this back to you.</i>

30:55.560 --> 30:57.596
It's, "See you in the funny pages. "

30:57.680 --> 31:00.478
OK, I took a liberty.
Her husband beats her.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.915
Bones, talk about multiple hypotheses!

31:03.000 --> 31:05.468
It's a leap, yes, but
it was bound to happen,

31:05.560 --> 31:09.189
me spending so much time with
you. I mean that as a compliment.

31:09.280 --> 31:14.149
OK. So Warren's former boss is the Twisted
and the boss's wife is the Opalescence.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.435
- Go back and arrest him.
- It's not enough.

31:16.520 --> 31:19.751
For that, we need something
just a little bit more reaI.

31:19.840 --> 31:22.559
- Evidence.
- Cold hard facts, baby.

31:34.360 --> 31:38.114
Dr Brennan, based on your
histology and the DNA,

31:38.200 --> 31:41.795
the bone found on Warren's neck
came from a Caucasian male, mid 30s.

31:41.880 --> 31:44.952
McGruder. What? Can you
get any more specific?

31:45.040 --> 31:48.510
- We need the weapon.
- I can get a warrant for whatever you want.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.909
We don't know what we're looking for.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.515
We hit a dead end reverse-engineering
it from the mark on the neck.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.319
<i>- Too much fragmentation.
- Wait.</i>

31:57.400 --> 32:00.676
You said that in books you could
find the reaI-world version.

32:00.760 --> 32:05.550
- Yeah. If you know you, it's pretty obvious.
- Well, give me an example.

32:05.640 --> 32:10.555
In your book, your partner's a former Olympic
boxer who spoke six different languages.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.949
In reaI life, you got me.

32:13.040 --> 32:18.637
So what you're saying is that reality
falls far, far short of the fictionaI.

32:18.720 --> 32:19.709
Yeah.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.995
Thanks a lot, Bones.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.996
Warren Granger's spinaI cord was severed
by something sharp, but not a knife.

32:30.200 --> 32:33.112
OK, if it wasn't a knife, what was it?

32:33.560 --> 32:37.553
The closest match I could find would
be a corkscrew or a Tibetan skull knife,

32:37.640 --> 32:42.111
but neither of them explain how foreign
bone was left lodged in the vertebrae.

32:42.200 --> 32:47.433
- Pull up Citizen 14's weapon thing.
- It was a boomerang thing, like a sonic gun.

32:47.520 --> 32:51.229
A laser cutlass. That thing that
allowed him to hear through walls.

32:51.320 --> 32:55.552
We're looking for something that has
a drabber version in the reaI world.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.995
Why would he be killed
by his own weapon?

32:58.080 --> 33:01.595
He had it on him the night he
decided to confront Ted McGruder.

33:01.680 --> 33:05.468
- Citizen 14's arsenaI.
- What's that?

33:05.560 --> 33:09.473
His main weapon. It's a three-sided
throwing knife that returns to him.

33:09.560 --> 33:15.271
None of them make the wounds that resemble
the one that severed Warren's spinaI cord.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.351
- It was just an idea.
- Bones...

33:17.440 --> 33:20.910
No. I-I fell into the exact
thing that I warned you about.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.039
Developing too many hypotheses
not grounded in fact.

33:25.120 --> 33:28.351
No. Bones, I know exactly
which drab reaI-world thing

33:28.440 --> 33:31.512
was used to murder Warren Granger.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.996
<i>He wants to feeI like a hero.
He's facing a damseI in distress.</i>

33:36.080 --> 33:39.470
- Lucy is ten years older.
- It's not the damseI part that matters.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.552
It's the distress that appealed
to the kid. I mean, look.

33:42.640 --> 33:45.154
It wasn't about sex or
romance. It never was.

33:45.240 --> 33:49.313
He wanted to make a difference
in the world before he died.

33:51.800 --> 33:54.394
I told you he was more like you than me.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.040
<i>22705. Dispatch.</i>

33:57.120 --> 33:58.599
22705.

33:58.680 --> 34:02.355
<i>Unit sent to suspect's residence
reports the domicile is empty.</i>

34:02.440 --> 34:05.989
<i>- What about the wife?
- Negative. Search team is inside the house.</i>

34:06.080 --> 34:08.469
<i>It's empty. Signs of flight.</i>

34:09.920 --> 34:12.114
Affirmative, Dispatch.

34:12.639 --> 34:15.234
He beats her but she
takes off with him anyway?

34:15.320 --> 34:17.514
SpousaI abuse syndrome.

34:19.159 --> 34:21.469
<i>- Dispatch, 22705.
- Dispatch.</i>

34:21.560 --> 34:25.473
Can you send a backup unit
to CapitaI BowI, 1123 Seabolt?

34:26.560 --> 34:31.270
Domestic disturbances are always weird,
OK? The woman gets beat on by her husband,

34:31.360 --> 34:36.150
the cavalry saves her. You'd think she'd
be on the same side as the rescuers, but...

34:36.239 --> 34:40.119
<i>You're saying watch out for the wife.</i>

34:40.199 --> 34:42.918
AII I'm saying is just stay alert.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.355
- OK, Bones?
- OK.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.556
<i>- Ted, why are we doing this?
- Shut up!</i>

34:48.639 --> 34:51.871
- You didn't do anything.
- I swear, if you don't shut up...

34:51.960 --> 34:56.272
<i>- I know you wouldn't hurt Warren.
- Of course he would.</i>

34:56.360 --> 34:59.432
- He likes to beat up people weaker than him.
- We're closed.

34:59.520 --> 35:03.638
You left your door unlocked. Probably
an oversight due to your state of panic.

35:03.720 --> 35:06.951
Yeah. Lights were on. You
see, we suspected a robbery.

35:07.040 --> 35:10.157
- Say, you have a beveI knife?
- A what?

35:10.240 --> 35:14.392
- It's a triangular three-sided knife.
- To clean out bowling ball holes.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.631
Say, I used to have one. You
wouldn't have one around here?

35:17.720 --> 35:20.439
You need a warrant to
take any of my stuff.

35:20.520 --> 35:23.239
Lucy, we need a beveI knife.

35:27.720 --> 35:30.075
- We keep one in here.
- Shut up, Lucy!

35:30.160 --> 35:35.029
Why don't you smack her around a little bit
there, Ted, huh? Keep your woman in line.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.551
Yeah.

35:59.640 --> 36:02.029
- This could've done it.
- Say, Bones.

36:02.120 --> 36:05.237
That, uh, bone chip
- second victim or murderer?

36:05.320 --> 36:08.710
Well, for Warren's sake,
I hope it was the murderer.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.236
- Me, too.
- What are you talking about? Get out of here.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.880
- It'd be his left arm.
- What?

36:14.960 --> 36:19.078
Warren was right-handed, so the wound
would be on your husband's left arm.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.116
- Oh, my God.
- Bones...

36:24.520 --> 36:26.317
<i>Right there.</i>

36:28.280 --> 36:31.511
<i>I got him. I got him. I got
him. I got him. All right.</i>

36:31.600 --> 36:35.513
Aw, hell, Bones, it looks like you
opened up an old wound there. Let's go.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.034
You're under arrest.
I hate a wife-beater.

36:38.120 --> 36:41.999
Almost as much as I hate
someone who kills a dying kid.

36:51.680 --> 36:55.116
Warren knew what Ted did to you.

36:55.200 --> 36:58.988
<i>- Did you tell him?
- I didn't have to. He saw one night.</i>

36:59.080 --> 37:02.755
Ted hit me, and Warren...

37:05.320 --> 37:08.357
- Warren ran away.
- Why didn't you go to the police?

37:08.440 --> 37:12.035
Because... it's not all the time.

37:12.120 --> 37:17.990
It's just when things go bad and he's
under a lot of strain. Ted has a bad temper.

37:18.080 --> 37:23.029
- Warren wanted to rescue you.
- Oh, my God.

37:23.120 --> 37:27.955
He probably just wanted to intimidate
your husband. Stop him from attacking you.

37:28.040 --> 37:31.077
Warren stabbed your husband
in the arm with the knife.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.912
Ted took the knife away from him.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.993
It wouldn't have been
hard. The boy was very ill.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.116
After that, it's like you said.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.794
Your husband has a bad temper.

40:09.520 --> 40:14.275
