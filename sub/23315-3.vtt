WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.333 --> 00:12.633
Oi, oi! we're back!

00:16.200 --> 00:19.100
Get me back in that house.
Aah!

00:19.167 --> 00:21.233
Stand by. Geordies incoming.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.500
Oh. My. God.

00:28.133 --> 00:30.800
I'm so excited,
I ca-ca-poo-poo'd in me
knickers.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.600
What's the three things
that Geordies are good at?

00:41.667 --> 00:42.933
Bucking...

00:43.000 --> 00:44.333
necking...

00:45.200 --> 00:46.600
...and drinking.

00:48.833 --> 00:51.033
Toon, we are coming for ya.

00:54.633 --> 00:56.233
Shit's about to go down.

00:57.767 --> 00:58.800
This is mint.

00:59.733 --> 01:01.100
(cheering)

01:03.067 --> 01:04.599
I'm fucking mortal.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.933
I'm gonna make her feel better
until she falls asleep

01:09.000 --> 01:10.967
because that's what best friends
do.

01:14.033 --> 01:17.233
I do not want to see this.
Abbie is supposed to be my pal

01:17.300 --> 01:20.033
and she's all over fucking Sam.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.367
(shouting)

01:21.433 --> 01:24.567
I think we know how you feel
about Sam and Abbie necking on.

01:24.633 --> 01:26.667
Say you don't know if you like.
You do.

01:26.733 --> 01:28.767
I'm absolutely sick of this
shit.

01:28.833 --> 01:32.267
I feel like it's too early days
to say, "I want you, I want
you."

01:32.333 --> 01:34.900
I'm not backing down,
I know I'm not in the wrong.

01:34.967 --> 01:37.167
I'll just let yous two crack on,
I'm done.

01:37.233 --> 01:41.367
This is exactly what I didn't
want.
I can't believe it's come to
this.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.367
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

01:48.433 --> 01:51.400
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:51.467 --> 01:54.200
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:54.267 --> 01:56.200
I'm preened to perfection.

01:56.267 --> 01:58.433
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.167
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:01.233 --> 02:03.933
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.867
I might be entirely bonkers,
but all the best people are.

02:07.933 --> 02:10.199
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:22.667 --> 02:24.933
Last night,
I had an argument with Chloe.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.933
And I ended up sleeping
in the shag pad by myself.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.400
This is proper shit.

02:31.767 --> 02:33.967
What the hell was last night
all about?

02:34.033 --> 02:37.667
How did it go so wrong?
It was like World War 3.

02:37.733 --> 02:42.133
Last night, it all kicked off
between Abbie, Sam and Chloe.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.300
I don't think it's gonna be
any less awkward this morning.

02:45.367 --> 02:49.400
I felt like I was in the middle
of it, but I haven't done
anything.

02:49.467 --> 02:51.433
It's not my fault they're
competing.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.033
At the end of the day,
I am doing nothing wrong.

02:54.100 --> 02:57.633
I'm getting to know both the
girls.
Not my fault they argue over me.

02:57.700 --> 03:01.067
Aaron, yet again, isn't in
this bedroom. Where is he?

03:04.100 --> 03:07.067
# Happy birthday to you

03:07.133 --> 03:09.067
# Happy birthday to Marnie #

03:09.133 --> 03:11.267
Worst Happy Birthday
I've ever heard.

03:11.333 --> 03:15.333
Woke up this morning, and I am
so
excited cos it's me birthday.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.233
Today is all about me.

03:17.300 --> 03:20.700
I thought, right, that Aaron
being in this room was a
one-off.

03:20.767 --> 03:24.167
I'm starting to think you're
enjoying the girls' room too
much.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.200
I know it's Marnie's birthday,
but come on, Aaron.

03:30.267 --> 03:33.567
Stop making it so obvious.
I know you still like her.

03:33.633 --> 03:36.467
This is fine. I can just be
like...
It's all right.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.967
I've woke up this morning
without the fear.

03:39.033 --> 03:42.367
Cos I'm in bed next to Marnie,
and not actually in Marnie's
bed.

03:42.433 --> 03:44.867
Who says exes can't be best
friends?

03:44.933 --> 03:46.100
Where's Abbie, guys?

03:46.167 --> 03:49.533
Abbie chose to go in the shag
pad,
which was the most stupid thing

03:49.600 --> 03:52.933
you can ever do. It's always
awkward when you come back in.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.333
I do feel bad
Abbie slept in the shag pad.

03:55.400 --> 03:59.000
That is the last thing I want.
But
last night just got too much for
us.

03:59.067 --> 04:01.733
It's me birthday
so you should definitely speak,

04:01.800 --> 04:04.333
so there's no awkwardness.
Right.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.667
I'm gonna do it now.

04:05.733 --> 04:08.367
I'm not falling out with Abbie
over a fucking boy.

04:08.433 --> 04:11.533
I'm gonna be the bigger person
and go and speak to her.

04:14.567 --> 04:16.166
Hello.
Hiya.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.933
I'm walking in the shag pad,
and I feel so nervous.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.700
Normally when you walk into a
shag
pad, you should be fucking
buzzing.

04:22.767 --> 04:25.267
I'm sorry you're out here
by yourself, Abbie.

04:25.333 --> 04:28.733
I thought it was best, after
last
night, for me to just go in
here.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.333
I shouldn't have went in.
You know what I'm like.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.633
It would have been better if
you'd have pulled me to the side

04:34.700 --> 04:38.200
and said, I've seen you chatting
to Sam, it's bothering us."

04:38.267 --> 04:41.067
I've been honest about my
feelings
from the start,

04:41.133 --> 04:44.367
but it's starting to cause
problems
between me and Chloe,

04:44.433 --> 04:46.500
I don't want that.
Even if I do like him.

04:46.567 --> 04:50.033
I'm just gonna stop things
with Sam now, kissing and
flirting.

04:50.100 --> 04:52.100
It's just gonna get too messy.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.233
I don't want to lose Abbie
as a friend,

04:54.300 --> 04:57.300
but I don't want to take
a step back from Sam either.

04:57.367 --> 05:01.067
I really like him. Everything I
do,
it's a lose-lose situation.

05:01.133 --> 05:04.400
Anyway, I'm happy that we're
friends again. Yeah, same.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.800
Aaron, is that my breakfast
you're cooking? Course.

05:11.867 --> 05:14.033
She loves a sausage for
breakfast.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.233
what do you wanna do
for your birthday?

05:16.300 --> 05:17.400
I wanna have a party!

05:17.467 --> 05:20.067
Oh!
I've got to!

05:20.133 --> 05:23.800
What's the theme tonight?
Last party we had was baby
theme.

05:23.867 --> 05:27.633
I want mine to be so much better
than that. I have got the best
idea.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.733
Kind of circus, like, carnival
type.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.267
What, like Rio de Janeiro,
like Brazil?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.533
Rio de Janeiro carnival.
I love that.

05:35.600 --> 05:39.300
It's gonna be so camp, so
colourful.
Just like me.

05:39.367 --> 05:42.967
(singing)

05:45.900 --> 05:49.133
While the others are decorating
the house for the party,

05:49.200 --> 05:53.000
I'm gonna sneak out with Nathan,
get
Marnie something for her
birthday.

05:53.067 --> 05:55.133
She is me best friend after all.

05:57.933 --> 06:01.400
I've gone with Aaron to help him
pick a special gift for Marnie.

06:01.467 --> 06:05.667
This must mean he knows I've got
good taste and he values my
opinion.

06:05.733 --> 06:09.467
What do I buy me friend?
Something
that sums up your friendship.

06:09.533 --> 06:12.633
This is how I'd describe yous.
This is you, this is Marnie.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.033
Yous are linked together.
In a friendship.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.567
I don't think you and Marnie
have
quite given up on each other
yet.

06:18.633 --> 06:22.133
Nathan, I brought you here to
help
us choose a present for Marnie,

06:22.200 --> 06:24.467
not to analyse our relationship.

06:24.533 --> 06:26.967
If you were single,
you'd get with Marnie.

06:27.033 --> 06:29.100
I can't answer.
I've got a girlfriend.

06:29.167 --> 06:31.267
Therefore, yes, you would.

06:31.333 --> 06:34.500
You would get with Marnie.
What you doing with a
girlfriend?

06:34.567 --> 06:37.100
I think you love Marnie.
I thinks he loves you.

06:37.167 --> 06:40.900
Of course I love Marnie.
But I'm not in love with her.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.567
Why can't everyone just accept
that we're just friends?

06:44.633 --> 06:48.200
It'd be interesting if her
boyfriend
comes to the party tonight.

06:48.267 --> 06:52.133
Are you still gonna go to her
and...
No, obviously not. No. I
couldn't.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.533
Me and Marnie are joined at the
hip,
it's gonna be fucking weird

06:55.600 --> 06:58.300
if her boyfriend turns up.
I won't have her to go to.

06:58.367 --> 07:01.067
And I'm not sure
how I will deal with it.

07:01.133 --> 07:04.000
We'll see when you've had a
drink.
Shut up, you dick.

07:04.067 --> 07:05.433
(laughs)

07:05.500 --> 07:07.833
We need to get this present.
Let's get that.

07:07.900 --> 07:11.167
Me and Nathan have found
the perfect present for Marnie,

07:11.233 --> 07:13.900
and I hope she fucking loves it.
I think that one.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.700
It's very romantic,
but very friendly,

07:16.767 --> 07:19.933
and slightly inappropriate.
Happy birthday, Marns.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.300
Go on, then.
Come on.

07:25.833 --> 07:29.267
Right, it's time to get
decorating.
We're gonna cover this house

07:29.333 --> 07:33.033
top to toe, tip to toe in
glitter,
whatever the fucking saying is.

07:34.967 --> 07:36.100
Ole!

07:38.100 --> 07:39.100
Hiya, Mam.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.000
I've had the best idea ever
for this house party.

07:42.067 --> 07:43.767
I'm gonna invite all of our mams

07:43.833 --> 07:46.767
because our mams
will get this party pumping.

07:46.833 --> 07:50.133
Have you heard from Casey?
Make sure he comes to the party,
OK?

07:50.200 --> 07:54.033
Me boyfriend Casey's invited.
This
party's gonna be out of this
world

07:55.700 --> 07:58.367
(cheering)

07:58.433 --> 08:00.067
Fucking hell.
Hello.

08:00.133 --> 08:03.400
Wait a second, whilst we've
been slaving away decorating,

08:03.467 --> 08:06.067
where the fuck have
these two slackers been?

08:06.133 --> 08:09.100
Where yous been? What's that?
Is that for me? No.

08:09.167 --> 08:12.467
Nathan and Aaron come back
very suspiciously.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.467
What have they got up their
sleeve?

08:14.533 --> 08:17.500
We had a boys' day.
What's that black bag?

08:17.567 --> 08:21.100
Everyone is being so nosey,
asking where me and Aaron have
been.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.933
Fuck off, will yous?

08:23.000 --> 08:26.167
Why so many questions,
you fucking nosey cunts. So
nosey.

08:26.233 --> 08:27.667
Well, that was weird.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.400
You do know, right,
if she wears all the time,

08:31.467 --> 08:33.267
that means she does like you.

08:33.332 --> 08:35.500
Nathan, man, shut the fuck up.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.100
Oi, oi.
Who's that?

08:39.167 --> 08:41.667
(cheering)

08:41.732 --> 08:43.866
The door's just gone,
and in walks Joel.

08:43.933 --> 08:46.600
It's always nice to see
the look on Sophie's face

08:46.667 --> 08:49.700
when her boyfriend turns up.
How are you? You all right?

08:49.767 --> 08:53.500
I've got Joel 'round to DJ. I'm
very
lucky that my boyfriend can just

08:53.567 --> 08:56.267
come to the house,
shag us, and then leave.

08:56.333 --> 08:58.033
What a perfect relationship.

08:58.100 --> 09:02.200
Yous, oh, my God, I can't get
over
the house. It looks incredible.

09:02.267 --> 09:04.767
Tonight's my first
Geordie house party,

09:04.833 --> 09:07.267
and I've heard they're proper
radge as fuck.

09:07.333 --> 09:11.033
With the house looking mint,
it's
time to go and get ready to
party.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.367
What's one saying?
I'd go another.

09:32.433 --> 09:35.700
Sam, get rid of the socks,
have a little play with your
knob,

09:35.767 --> 09:38.433
get some blood rushing to it.
It'll be fine.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.533
I've heard the parties
at this house are fucking mint,

09:41.600 --> 09:45.000
so I cannot wait for my first
one.
They're also known...

09:45.067 --> 09:46.367
for fucking kick-offs.

09:46.433 --> 09:49.200
If it's like last night,
you're in the firing line.

09:49.267 --> 09:52.133
I haven't spoken to
Abbie or Chloe all day,

09:52.200 --> 09:55.333
so I'm a little bit nervous
about how tonight is gonna go.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.167
I just hope there's no
kick-offs.

09:57.233 --> 10:01.000
What have yous two been up to?
We
got a nice little present for
Marns.

10:01.067 --> 10:04.000
The type you'd get your future
wife.
So romantic.

10:04.067 --> 10:07.600
What will her boyfriend say?
I don't think it'll be a big
deal.

10:07.667 --> 10:11.200
I don't give a fuck. I can buy
Marnie whatever I wanna buy her.

10:11.267 --> 10:13.467
If she wears it
on her wrist constantly...

10:13.533 --> 10:16.367
She wants to, the money it cost.
It's gonna happen.

10:16.433 --> 10:18.600
I wish I'd never
took Nathan shopping.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.333
All he's done is wind us up.

10:23.233 --> 10:25.700
If Casey comes,
do you think you'll, erm, shag?

10:25.767 --> 10:27.333
No.
No?

10:27.400 --> 10:31.933
Nah, because... this was kind of
the home of me and Aaron.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.467
It's already weird enough
thinking
that me ex and me boyfriend

10:35.533 --> 10:38.767
are gonna be in the same house,
never mind doing any of that.

10:38.833 --> 10:41.600
(cheering)

10:41.667 --> 10:44.533
Marns, come here.
Why is your hand behind your
back?

10:44.600 --> 10:48.200
I've got Marnie, I'll take her
in the snug to give her her
present.

10:48.267 --> 10:50.267
I'm honestly praying she likes
it.

10:50.333 --> 10:53.667
I hope this is gonna be
the best party. I hope so.

10:53.733 --> 10:56.733
Is your lad coming?
I think s... Well, I hope so.

10:57.367 --> 11:00.000
You don't feel awkward
or anything, do you? No.

11:00.933 --> 11:04.367
As awkward as I do feel, I'm not
gonna make it awkward for
Marnie.

11:04.433 --> 11:07.300
If Casey turns up,
I'll stay well out of their way.

11:08.267 --> 11:12.300
I've actually really tried for
this.
I hope you like it. Right.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.200
Aww.
Right, so, look.

11:15.267 --> 11:18.133
This has got "best friend" on.
Yeah.

11:18.200 --> 11:22.000
And I got you the crown because
you
think you're a princess.
(laughs)

11:22.067 --> 11:24.867
But you're really not.
Aaron, I absolutely love it.

11:24.933 --> 11:27.767
That is the nicest thing
anyone's ever gotten for me.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.433
It's just such a nice present.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.900
This is the sweetest
I have ever seen Aaron.

11:31.967 --> 11:35.633
And it just goes to show that we
genuinely do care about each
other.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.667
That'll never change
whether we're together or not.

11:38.733 --> 11:41.200
I treasure you so much.
You mean so much to me.

11:41.267 --> 11:44.333
And that is the nicest thing
you could've done for us.

11:44.400 --> 11:48.300
The present's gone down very
well
and Marnie fucking loves it.

11:48.367 --> 11:51.667
I don't know why she's put it on
her wrist cos if Casey turns up,

11:51.733 --> 11:53.433
it might be a bit awkward.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.067
Why are you such a cutie?

11:55.133 --> 11:57.967
(cheering)

11:59.167 --> 12:01.800
What was it?
He got me a lovely bracelet.

12:01.867 --> 12:05.533
If that was you wearing your
ex's
bracelet, I'd fucking kill her.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.233
Yeah, but you know what it is?
Yous aren't me?

12:08.300 --> 12:10.733
Everyone has always got
something to say,

12:10.800 --> 12:14.267
but in this case, I need
everyone
to keep their fucking noses out.

12:14.333 --> 12:17.900
I honestly think we should have
a
fucking wicked night for Marnie.

12:17.967 --> 12:20.933
(cheering)
Thank you, guys.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.200
pass me the vodka,
cos I'm getting fucking mortal.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.067
(cheering)

12:27.800 --> 12:31.800
Oh, my God. Here are all our
mas, and
they're absolutely fucking
mortal.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.833
This is gonna be a fucking
nightmare.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.667
(cheering)
My nan is here.

12:35.733 --> 12:38.633
And I'm a bit worried
cos she's already mortal.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.000
(cheering)

12:40.067 --> 12:42.067
This is gonna be a crazy night.

12:50.067 --> 12:52.700
I need to get me mam
and me nana out of here.

12:55.967 --> 12:57.367
What the fuck, Case?

12:58.400 --> 13:00.233
This is way out of hand.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.333
I've just lost the fucking plot.

13:08.967 --> 13:09.167
.

13:11.700 --> 13:11.900
.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.833
This party's going off.
Everyone's having such a mint
time.

13:33.900 --> 13:37.967
I might be new to this house,
but
I know a good party when I see
one.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.633
My mam has always loved Aaron,
and she is the one person

13:53.700 --> 13:56.133
who really knows the situation
between us.

13:59.233 --> 14:01.367
Guarantee you don't see this
every day.

14:01.433 --> 14:05.067
Talking to your ex and her
mother
and actually getting on.

14:14.367 --> 14:17.867
Me mam knows how close
me and Aaron are as friends.

14:17.933 --> 14:20.000
I just hope that
Casey can see it, too.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.433
Hi.
Hiya. All right?

14:27.500 --> 14:28.867
Yeah.
Good night?

14:28.933 --> 14:31.933
I'm still trying to stay away
from Sam after last night.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.733
But I feel like I need to be
more worried about me mam.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.033
What's she doing, man?

14:48.567 --> 14:50.833
I do like Chloe's mam.
She's really funny.

14:50.900 --> 14:53.767
They do say daughters
turn into their mams.

15:01.433 --> 15:05.400
I need to know what me mam and
Sam
were chatting about. Fucking
weird.

15:11.633 --> 15:14.533
She says that she likes him.
This is not helping!

15:29.133 --> 15:30.833
Enough chatting with me mam.

15:30.900 --> 15:33.333
I need to get inside
to get me and her drunk

15:33.400 --> 15:35.167
cos it's a party!

15:58.667 --> 16:00.400
If Marnie's boyfriend turns up,

16:00.467 --> 16:03.333
then tonight I'm not gonna
make it awkward for Marnie.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.667
I've never met the kid.

16:04.733 --> 16:07.767
Plus, everyone's forgetting
I'm in a relationship, too.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.533
Me and Marnie are just friends.

16:24.967 --> 16:28.433
My nana is amazing at advice.
Even when she's mortal.

16:28.500 --> 16:31.500
So, I just hope she can help us
with the Sam situation.

16:47.367 --> 16:49.367
I understand what my nana
is saying,

16:49.433 --> 16:52.333
but my friendship with Chloe
is far too important

16:52.400 --> 16:55.533
just for me to go for it with
Sam.
Especially when Chloe said

16:55.600 --> 16:57.200
she'd stay away from him, too.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.933
The party is going so good,
everyone looks amazing,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.900
everyone's having such a good
night.
The only thing missing is Casey.

17:19.433 --> 17:22.700
Just at the point when I'd
given up hope on Casey turning
up,

17:22.767 --> 17:25.200
he walks in.
And I am buzzing to see him.

17:28.733 --> 17:31.167
This is a fucking shit situation
to be in.

17:31.233 --> 17:35.100
But it is Marnie's birthday, and
the
last thing I wanna do is ruin
it.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.833
Marnie's boyfriend
has bought her flowers.

17:38.900 --> 17:42.533
That's cute.
But Aaron bought her a bracelet.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.500
And that's expensive.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.367
Casey's only been here two
minutes,

18:08.433 --> 18:11.733
and he's already giving us grief
about Aaron. What the hell?

18:15.867 --> 18:19.633
I look over, and Marnie's upset.
What the fuck has Casey said to
her?

18:19.700 --> 18:22.267
Usually,
when Marnie's upset, I comfort
her.

18:22.333 --> 18:25.400
This is tough for me.
I just need to leave them to it.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.967
Casey just isn't getting it
tonight.

18:32.033 --> 18:35.600
It's so strange because we've
had
this conversation so many times.

18:39.067 --> 18:41.500
Marnie and Casey are
in the girls' room,

18:41.567 --> 18:44.700
and I don't know what's going
on.
I wanna go and check on her,

18:44.767 --> 18:47.000
but I know that'll just
make things worse.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.433
I thought showing Casey the
charm
that says "best friends"

19:02.500 --> 19:05.433
would calm him down.
But he's behaving really badly.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.767
I'll fucking throw it out.
Casey!

19:07.833 --> 19:10.833
Why would you care about that?
You can't do that!

19:10.900 --> 19:12.067
What the fuck, Case?

19:12.133 --> 19:14.867
(indistinct) You say,
"No, I've got a boyfriend,

19:14.933 --> 19:17.833
I don't want a bracelet from my
ex."
Simple as.

19:17.900 --> 19:21.000
What have you done with him
then?
Nothing!

19:21.067 --> 19:23.267
Nothing, man!

19:23.333 --> 19:27.767
Me and Aaron are just friends!
I can't say it anymore.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.033
(sobs)

19:34.600 --> 19:38.800
Abbie's nana is fucking
crackers.
I thinks she's more crackers
than me.

19:49.867 --> 19:54.467
I love Abbie's gran. She should
be
in this house living with us.

20:03.467 --> 20:06.167
Me and Casey are gonna go
round and round in circles

20:06.233 --> 20:08.300
We're not gonna
get anywhere tonight.

20:08.367 --> 20:12.833
I am emotionally exhausted. I
can't
even face me own birthday party.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.533
I'm gonna go to bed.

20:20.367 --> 20:23.800
I haven't spoken to Sam since
last night, when it kicked off.

20:23.867 --> 20:26.700
But I have got a few things
I want to get off me chest.

20:33.567 --> 20:37.167
After last night, I've realised
that both Chloe and Abi do like
me.

20:37.233 --> 20:41.033
And although I shouldn't be
flirting
with them both, I can't help it.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.233
I understand what Chloe's
saying.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.600
I shouldn't mess around
within the family.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.300
But she looks so good tonight.

20:53.367 --> 20:55.700
Nothing wrong with a cheeky
kiss,
is there?

20:57.867 --> 20:59.133
No.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.633
I do really, really want to kiss
Sam,
but I am not going there.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.933
Not after what happened last
night,
like.

21:25.367 --> 21:28.100
I need to get me mam and me nana
out of here

21:28.167 --> 21:30.033
because they are way too mortal.

21:37.767 --> 21:40.633
I don't wanna have to deal
with anyone else tonight.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.733
I'm getting myself off to bed.

21:44.333 --> 21:48.633
My first house party done. It
was
unreal, but it's time for bed.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.700
I'm trying to get to sleep,
but I can't

22:00.767 --> 22:05.133
because Aaron's babbling on
about
turkey. What the fuck's he on
about?

22:09.300 --> 22:12.267
Tonight has been a lot to take
in.
Marnie's been upset,

22:12.333 --> 22:15.900
and I'm normally the one that
would comfort her. And I
couldn't.

22:15.967 --> 22:19.800
I start picking on Nathan,
taking it
all out on him. I know I
shouldn't,

22:19.867 --> 22:23.033
but me frustration has been
building up all night.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.567
Me and Aaron are always
bantering
each other, but this isn't
funny.

22:29.633 --> 22:32.367
He's obviously frustrated
with Casey and Marnie.

22:37.733 --> 22:41.333
Aaron, stop this now.
This is so childish.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.967
If Aaron wants to be a little
bitch,
I'll be a bitch, too.

22:50.033 --> 22:51.233
See how you like this.

22:55.267 --> 22:57.600
This has been building up
inside of Aaron,

22:57.667 --> 23:00.733
and now that he's had a drink,
the truth has all came out.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.300
He does still like Marnie.

23:05.367 --> 23:07.467
Casey's next door with Marnie
in bed.

23:07.533 --> 23:09.867
Nathan's talking about
my relationship

23:09.933 --> 23:12.333
and I've just lost the fucking
plot.

23:13.133 --> 23:16.667
Whoa. Aaron has just gone for
Nathan.
This is way out of hand.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.700
All I know,
I've made one silly comment,

23:20.767 --> 23:23.600
and Aaron is on top of us,
pinning us to the bed.

23:24.733 --> 23:28.133
It's all kicking off. The boys
are scrapping with each other.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.967
Joel's getting involved,
I am, Chloe is.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.767
It's all got too much,
I've massively overstepped the
mark.

23:35.833 --> 23:39.267
I've taken meself to the shag
pad
to calm down for the night.

23:39.333 --> 23:42.000
I'm surprised at the way
Aaron's gone on tonight.

23:42.067 --> 23:44.567
It's not OK to do that
to one of your friends.

23:44.633 --> 23:48.500
I've clearly hit a nerve by
talking
about his feelings for Marnie.

23:48.567 --> 23:51.533
I'm gonna have to speak to him
in the morning.

23:51.967 --> 23:56.467
Toon Tours are going to
Tenerife.
(cheering) I can't wait.

23:58.833 --> 24:01.367
Both of them have gone
without saying goodbye.

24:01.433 --> 24:03.367
Why would they do that?
Tenerife!

24:03.433 --> 24:04.800
See ya later, the Toon.

24:10.467 --> 24:10.667
.

24:13.167 --> 24:13.367
.

24:26.767 --> 24:28.300
I've woken up in the shag pad.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.400
Nathan hit a nerve with me
last night

24:30.467 --> 24:32.533
when he started talking
about Marnie.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.233
But I took it way too far.
I feel terrible.

24:35.300 --> 24:38.367
What the fuck happened last
night?
How did it escalate?

24:38.433 --> 24:41.033
I just remember him
calling Nathan a turkey.

24:41.100 --> 24:44.467
Yeah, he called me a turkey and
then
he was almost gonna punch me.

24:44.533 --> 24:45.567
(laughs)

24:45.633 --> 24:48.833
I can't believe how quickly
things escalated last night.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.967
It went from Aaron
calling me a turkey

24:51.033 --> 24:53.400
to me talking about
his feelings for Marnie.

24:53.467 --> 24:56.400
Next, it's kicking off.
He was really angry, Nathan.

24:56.467 --> 24:58.900
He was literally shaking
like a shitting dog.

24:58.967 --> 25:03.167
I haven't seen Aaron this
morning,
but he needs to say sorry to
Nathan.

25:03.233 --> 25:05.700
What he done last night
was so out of order.

25:05.767 --> 25:08.633
Do you think him seeing Marnie
with her boyfriend

25:08.700 --> 25:11.967
sorta pushed him over the edge?
It's hurt him, hasn't it?

25:12.033 --> 25:13.567
I think it was a shock.

25:13.633 --> 25:15.433
Last night was too much for
Aaron.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.800
Unfortunately,
I took the brunt of it all.

25:17.867 --> 25:22.000
Yous, I'm not gonna lie, right,
last night I was so drunk...

25:22.067 --> 25:26.033
I've pissed the bed.
I have pissed the motherfucking
bed.

25:26.100 --> 25:28.900
And I'm still lying in it
cos I can't be arsed to move

25:28.967 --> 25:30.567
cos I'm that fucking tired.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.900
I wonder how Aaron's feeling
this morning, you know, guys.

25:36.967 --> 25:40.333
Last night was out of hand.
You've got no idea. What
happened?

25:40.400 --> 25:43.000
It got really personal
between him and Nathan.

25:43.067 --> 25:46.133
They ended up having, like, a
scrap.
What?!

25:46.200 --> 25:49.567
That's new. I didn't know about
that.
I didn't know about that.

25:49.633 --> 25:52.767
I can't believe Aaron had
a fight with Nathan last night.

25:52.833 --> 25:56.167
How did I miss that? I wasn't
the only one who had a shit
night.

25:56.233 --> 26:00.100
I thought you were really mean
to me
last night. I don't think I was.

26:00.167 --> 26:03.100
I really think you was.
I don't think I was mean at all.

26:03.167 --> 26:06.267
The only thing that pissed me
off
was the bracelet thing.

26:06.333 --> 26:10.933
For God's sakes, Casey, just
forget about the fucking
bracelet!

26:11.000 --> 26:13.600
It's just a friendship bracelet.
I know.

26:13.667 --> 26:16.400
But it's a friendship with your
ex...
And, right...

26:16.467 --> 26:20.700
...who you've been with. Me and
Aaron
don't look at each other like
exes.

26:26.433 --> 26:29.400
Me and Casey are never gonna
sort anything out in here.

26:29.467 --> 26:32.633
And I'm sick of arguing over
the bracelet. I'm over it.

26:32.700 --> 26:35.700
It's best we sort this out
when I get out of this house.

26:36.367 --> 26:37.633
Bye.

26:37.700 --> 26:39.333
Love ya!
Love ya!

26:39.400 --> 26:42.167
Now Casey's gone,
I need to find out what happened

26:42.233 --> 26:45.700
between Aaron and Nathan.
Hearing
they had a fight does worry us.

26:45.767 --> 26:47.967
That's really out of character
for Aaron.

26:48.033 --> 26:50.067
Something must have
really upset him.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Morning.

26:52.067 --> 26:54.533
I'm sitting in bed
feeling sorry for meself,

26:54.600 --> 26:57.467
then in walks Marnie.
Am I glad to see your face.

26:57.533 --> 27:01.000
So, tell us exactly what
happened.
You know I was passed out,

27:01.067 --> 27:02.567
or I would have been here.

27:02.633 --> 27:05.033
What was hard for me is,
you're upstairs,

27:05.100 --> 27:08.100
I knew you were upset,
and I couldn't come and see you.

27:08.167 --> 27:10.000
That's been at the back of me
mind,

27:10.067 --> 27:12.233
Nathan's the tip of the iceberg.
Yeah.

27:12.300 --> 27:14.300
I should never have went for
Nathan.

27:14.367 --> 27:17.767
But when I've had a lot to drink
and people are getting personal,

27:17.833 --> 27:21.567
it's gonna come to blows. You
wouldn't intentionally hurt
Nathan.

27:21.633 --> 27:24.233
It was just a very, very long,
hard day.

27:24.300 --> 27:28.167
And it was an awkward situation.
Alcohol-fuelled, it just tips
over.

27:28.233 --> 27:30.067
I think me and Aaron can both
agree

27:30.133 --> 27:32.800
that this situation
is never gonna be easy.

27:32.867 --> 27:34.967
We've just gotta tackle it
day by day.

27:35.033 --> 27:38.000
Another house party
successfully ruined. Again.

27:38.067 --> 27:39.867
By us.
By us two.

27:39.933 --> 27:41.833
Us radgies. All of us.

27:41.900 --> 27:44.500
I do feel so much better
after talking to Marnie

27:44.567 --> 27:46.167
and getting that off me chest.

27:46.233 --> 27:49.033
All I wanna do now is
speak to Nathan and apologise.

27:51.567 --> 27:53.233
How fucking mental are the mams

27:53.300 --> 27:56.700
and fucking nanas that come
here?
She fell down them stairs.

27:56.767 --> 28:00.167
And as she fell, she still
managed to drink and neck her
wine

28:00.233 --> 28:02.300
while she was laid on the stirs.

28:05.300 --> 28:07.567
Hello, yous lot.
Hiya, Anna. Hello.

28:07.633 --> 28:11.467
I am absolutely hanging. I don't
think anything can make me feel
worse

28:11.533 --> 28:14.667
than what I do.
Oh, wait there, possibly Anna.

28:14.733 --> 28:16.400
What's happened here?

28:16.467 --> 28:18.900
Right, it was Marnie's birthday,
so come on,

28:18.967 --> 28:21.633
we had to throw a party for her.
Where was my invite?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.300
No bosses allowed.

28:23.367 --> 28:26.200
Sorry, Anna, we wanted our
guests
to actually stay,

28:26.267 --> 28:29.500
not be frightened off by your
face.
Hi, Marnie. Hi, Aaron.

28:29.567 --> 28:32.200
Hello, Anna.
I've got some news to tell yous.

28:32.267 --> 28:33.267
(gasps)

28:33.333 --> 28:35.800
Some really big news.
Oh, my God.

28:35.867 --> 28:39.100
Toon Tours and its ambassadors
are going worldwide.

28:39.167 --> 28:42.800
We're gonna start... with...
(gasps)

28:42.867 --> 28:46.267
...Tenerife.
(all cheer)

28:47.900 --> 28:49.433
# When I say Tene

28:49.500 --> 28:51.067
(all) # You say rife

28:51.133 --> 28:52.733
# Tene, rife!

28:52.800 --> 28:54.433
# Tene, rife! #

28:55.433 --> 28:59.533
I do have some bad news.
(gasps) Not everyone.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.200
Aaron?
Yeah.

29:01.267 --> 29:05.467
Your behaviour towards Nathan
last night, totally
unacceptable.

29:05.533 --> 29:08.067
You completely overstepped the
mark.

29:10.467 --> 29:13.633
But, Aaron, you won't be
travelling with the others.

29:15.067 --> 29:17.467
Anna, that is fair enough.
I do need punish,

29:17.533 --> 29:19.267
but I'm fucking gutted.

29:19.333 --> 29:23.100
Good luck, but please remember
who you're representing, OK?

29:24.333 --> 29:27.167
It's me own fault, like.
I shouldn't go on like that.

29:27.233 --> 29:30.500
I'm actually gutted that
Aaron's not coming to Tenerife.

29:30.567 --> 29:33.967
We are a family.
It's not nice leaving anyone
behind.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.767
I don't want to go, then.

29:35.833 --> 29:37.967
Why would you not wanna go
to Tenerife?

29:38.033 --> 29:40.867
I think it would be really wrong
if I went to Tenerife

29:40.933 --> 29:44.333
after the way things went down
with me and Casey last night.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.567
Aaron's not going, fuck it, I'm
not.
I don't wanna go.

29:47.633 --> 29:49.833
I may have only been here
a few days,

29:49.900 --> 29:53.533
but I can tell that these two
can't
be in the house without each
other.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.733
Why wouldn't you wanna go
to Tenerife?

29:55.800 --> 29:58.233
Nathan, can I have a chat?

29:58.300 --> 30:01.667
While the others are packing
for Tenerife, I've grabbed
Nathan

30:01.733 --> 30:03.700
so I can apologise to him
privately.

30:03.767 --> 30:07.700
I just wanna say, obviously,
like...
a massive apology. I am sorry.

30:07.767 --> 30:11.400
You know... I would never wanna
hurt yous. You are like me
brother.

30:11.467 --> 30:14.667
Seen Marnie and Casey arguing,
and I can't help Marnie out

30:14.733 --> 30:17.600
cos they're arguing over me.
You got the brunt of it.

30:17.667 --> 30:21.100
I knew exactly what was going
through Aaron's head last night.

30:21.167 --> 30:24.033
Which is why I'm not bothered
about it this morning.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.200
I just want Aaron to feel
better.

30:26.267 --> 30:28.833
Not gonna fall out over it, are
we?
Of course not.

30:28.900 --> 30:32.233
That's what brothers do.
We fight, argue, we always make
up.

30:32.300 --> 30:33.467
I do apologise.

30:33.533 --> 30:36.267
I feel so much better
that I've now spoken to Marnie

30:36.333 --> 30:37.667
and made up with Nathan.

30:37.733 --> 30:40.600
But they're going to Tenerife,
and I've gotta go home.

30:40.667 --> 30:43.833
Tenerife! Tenerife!

30:53.700 --> 30:57.567
I actually speak Spanish as
well,
you know. I'll fit straight in.

30:57.633 --> 31:02.467
Manana a la piscina
con mi... familia.

31:02.533 --> 31:05.267
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go swimming
with my family.

31:05.333 --> 31:07.033
Sam grande penis.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.900
Sam big penis. (laughs)

31:09.967 --> 31:11.267
(laughs)

31:16.233 --> 31:18.833
I can't believe that Aaron's
not coming, yous.

31:18.900 --> 31:21.433
I know, I'm gutted.
He's gotta learn a lesson.

31:21.500 --> 31:25.467
He can't go on like that. Marnie
says
she doesn't wanna go if Aaron's
not.

31:25.533 --> 31:28.900
She's got us. She should
think of it like a girls'
holiday.

31:28.967 --> 31:31.633
I know Marnie and Aaron
have got a lot of history,

31:31.700 --> 31:34.200
but she doesn't need him to have
fun.

31:34.267 --> 31:37.600
Marnie hasn't packed her case
yet.
Think we should go get her?

31:37.667 --> 31:41.167
Let's finish packing ours
cos we'll miss our fucking
flight.

31:41.233 --> 31:45.800
We are all gonna love Tenerife.
It's like a posh version of
Magaluf.

31:51.767 --> 31:54.800
I being serious, Aaron,
I'm not going to Tenerife.

31:54.867 --> 31:57.533
Why?
I'm not going if you're not
going.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.833
Shall we just fuck off now,
then?

31:59.900 --> 32:02.100
Shall we go now, or not?
Shall we?

32:02.167 --> 32:03.867
I haven't got me case.

32:03.933 --> 32:06.733
I might be in me PJs
and I might have no stuff with
us,

32:06.800 --> 32:09.633
but I've made my decision.
And I know I go upstairs,

32:09.700 --> 32:11.800
they'll all try and change me
mind,

32:11.867 --> 32:14.367
so I'm gonna sneak out now
and go home.

32:19.033 --> 32:22.367
Get the red carpet out!
The Geordies are on the way.

32:22.433 --> 32:26.000
Where's Marnie and Aaron? Both
of
them have gone without a
goodbye.

32:26.067 --> 32:28.367
Why would they do that?

32:28.433 --> 32:32.667
She said if Aaron's not coming,
she
won't. Why would she not wanna
go?

32:32.733 --> 32:33.967
It's a free trip.

32:34.033 --> 32:38.300
What the actual fuck? I didn't
think
Marnie wouldn't come to Tenerife

32:38.367 --> 32:42.300
because Aaron's not going. I'm
her
cousin. She should stay with me.

32:42.367 --> 32:45.367
Yous, I think we're gonna go
on a fucking mad one.

32:45.433 --> 32:49.267
It is weird going away without
Aaron
and Marnie, but we have a job to
do.

32:49.333 --> 32:51.400
After all,
it's what we get paid for.

32:51.467 --> 32:53.400
Get me to Tenerife now.
(all cheer)

32:53.467 --> 32:55.900
Tenerife! Tenerife!

32:59.033 --> 33:01.267
Even though we've lost
Aaron and Marnie,

33:01.333 --> 33:04.967
we're still gonna have the best
time
ever, aren't we? I can't wait.

33:05.033 --> 33:08.867
Oh, my God, daytime drinking,
parties, boat parties. Beach
parties.

33:08.933 --> 33:09.967
Pool parties.

33:10.033 --> 33:13.533
Tenerife, my first family
holiday?
I can't wait.

33:15.267 --> 33:17.267
Come on, everybody!

33:17.333 --> 33:19.133
(all cheer)

33:19.200 --> 33:22.100
See ya later, the Toon.
Hello, Tenerife.

33:24.567 --> 33:25.900
Bring it on.

33:28.267 --> 33:30.500
I wish I could just join in.

33:30.567 --> 33:32.967
I would like to believe Chloe
when she told me

33:33.033 --> 33:35.067
she wouldn't get with Sam.

33:35.633 --> 33:36.633
Oops.

33:42.933 --> 33:43.133
.

33:45.667 --> 33:45.867
.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.067
(all cheer)

33:56.133 --> 33:57.967
Yous, wait, I've got me heels
on.

33:58.033 --> 34:01.967
We've arrived at Tenerife,
and it is fucking roasting.

34:02.033 --> 34:04.300
I am buzzing.

34:07.033 --> 34:10.766
Everyone's literally in holiday
mode
cos I can't hear myself think.

34:10.833 --> 34:13.867
We might be two people down,
but this is not gonna stop us

34:13.933 --> 34:17.400
from having the best holiday
ever.
I might even get to see Chloe

34:17.467 --> 34:21.199
and Abbie in their bikinis.
Pass me the sangria!

34:21.266 --> 34:23.067
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ya, ay, ay,
ay!

34:27.233 --> 34:29.733
(cheering)

34:29.800 --> 34:33.632
We've finally arrived at the
villa,
and it feels like we've been
driving

34:33.699 --> 34:36.367
all night, I didn't realise
Tenerife was that big.

34:36.433 --> 34:40.533
Whoa. Right, I call shotgun
bedroom.
Shotgun bedroom!

34:40.600 --> 34:44.132
As we step in the door,
it's a dash for the best
bedroom.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.699
Tenerife! Tenerife!

34:48.567 --> 34:50.433
Yous, it's like a Jacuzzi.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.632
This is mint!
Flamingo and everything.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.933
Sam, get your kit off.
We're going in.

34:55.967 --> 34:58.000
(cheering)

34:59.033 --> 35:01.367
Sam and Nathan are
jumping in the pool naked

35:01.433 --> 35:04.933
and I'm trying to look at Sam's
cock,
but I can't see anything.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.533
That is not a good sign.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.367
I'll leave yous to it.

35:08.433 --> 35:10.933
Haway, lads,
get ready, we're going out.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.100
Let's get ready!
(all cheer)

35:23.100 --> 35:26.600
How do you feel about sharing a
bed?
Will it bring our bond close?

35:26.667 --> 35:28.900
Our bond can't get any closer.

35:28.967 --> 35:31.467
I know Sam hasn't been here
that long,

35:31.533 --> 35:34.167
but we've already got
a bit of a bromance going on.

35:34.233 --> 35:37.000
And I know this trip
is gonna bring us closer.

35:37.067 --> 35:39.600
This is my side, this is your
side.
We share now.

35:39.667 --> 35:41.600
Unless I end in the shag pad.

35:41.667 --> 35:43.600
With who?
This is the question.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.467
You do know the heat
makes you horny?

35:47.533 --> 35:51.467
Does it? How do you know that?
Cos it
does. It does something to
hormones.

35:51.533 --> 35:52.800
Does it?
Yeah.

35:52.867 --> 35:56.000
So, what are you gonna do with
Sam?
Keep a close eye on him,

35:56.067 --> 35:58.833
see how he goes on with me
and Abbie. I won't kiss him.

35:58.900 --> 36:01.600
Last night,
Sam tried to kiss us and I said
no.

36:01.667 --> 36:05.500
I just hope, tonight, I can stay
strong and stick to my word.

36:05.567 --> 36:08.533
I do wanna neck on. God forbid,
I do.
God forbid.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.567
God forbid...
God forbid, I do want to neck
on.

36:11.633 --> 36:13.433
I know Chloe's trying to be
good,

36:13.500 --> 36:17.333
but I just wanna see me friend
happy, and Sam makes her happy.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.933
So I'm holding on to a little
hope
that they sort it out.

36:24.100 --> 36:25.833
So, how do you feel about Sam?

36:25.900 --> 36:29.300
I do like him. But after the
argument that me and Chloe had,

36:29.367 --> 36:31.700
we both agreed that
we were gonna stay away

36:31.767 --> 36:34.033
and it wasn't worth arguing
over a boy.

36:34.100 --> 36:37.433
I do still really like Sam,
but I know if I went there,

36:37.500 --> 36:39.900
me and Chloe would end up
falling out again.

36:39.967 --> 36:42.233
If you don't wanna lose
that friendship,

36:42.300 --> 36:46.100
then I wouldn't go there cos
there's
plenty more fish in the sea.

36:46.167 --> 36:47.967
It's easier said than done.

36:49.267 --> 36:52.200
(laughs) Ooh, we're all
very colourful tonight.

36:52.267 --> 36:53.600
We're all very orange.

36:53.667 --> 36:55.933
Everybody is looking
absolutely mint,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.200
and I cannot wait for our
first night out.

36:58.267 --> 37:01.000
I am gonna be the drunkest man
on this volcano.

37:01.067 --> 37:04.467
First night in wuh unreal pad,
we're gonna fucking smash it.

37:04.533 --> 37:08.000
(all cheer)
Let's go to the club!

37:08.067 --> 37:11.900
Tonight's the first night, so
it's gotta be wicked,
drama-free,

37:11.967 --> 37:14.867
no kick-offs,
and everyone having fun.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.500
I'm fucking buzzing
for tonight, guys!

37:17.567 --> 37:19.800
(all cheer)

37:19.867 --> 37:23.867
What the fuck has got into us?
I know! This is not normal.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.367
Tonight is going to be
an incredible night.

37:35.433 --> 37:39.300
We are all in the best mood.
Bring it on.

37:44.600 --> 37:47.300
I know I said to Abbie
I would keep it friendly,

37:47.367 --> 37:50.967
but Sophie is right, the
Tenerife sun
is making me so horny.

37:51.033 --> 37:53.867
All I wanna do is talk to Sam
cos I'm so horny!

37:58.433 --> 38:00.833
Me and Chloe haven't spoke
that much today,

38:00.900 --> 38:03.700
so I cannot wait to have a flirt
with her tonight.

38:09.733 --> 38:13.333
Last night made me realise Chloe
is not gonna keep cracking on to
me

38:13.400 --> 38:17.400
as long as I am talking to
Abbie.
But tonight, Chloe is looking
fit,

38:17.467 --> 38:19.833
and everybody knows that
God loves a trier.

38:34.700 --> 38:37.233
I'm trying so hard to be
respectful for Abbie,

38:37.300 --> 38:38.867
but I just want to neck on.

38:58.933 --> 39:01.800
Me and Sam are having a chat,
and I do enjoy his company,

39:01.867 --> 39:05.567
but I'm not gonna go there
after the chat I had with Chloe.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.800
Abbie is trying to play it
very cool,

39:11.867 --> 39:13.700
but I can tell that she fancies
me.

39:25.733 --> 39:27.867
I'm not answering that question,
Sam,

39:27.933 --> 39:29.867
cos I like to keep things a
mystery.

39:29.933 --> 39:33.400
But I'm gonna go and have a
dance
before anything gets awkward.

39:45.400 --> 39:48.900
I know Chloe, and I know when
she's
this happy, there's a reason.

39:48.967 --> 39:51.733
And I've got a feeling
that reason is Sam.

39:56.467 --> 39:58.400
being around Sam makes me so
happy.

39:58.467 --> 40:01.567
He's so skinny, he's so sexy,
and I do really like him.

40:08.167 --> 40:09.900
This is the most selfless thing

40:09.967 --> 40:12.300
I've ever heard
come out of Chloe's mouth.

40:12.367 --> 40:13.900
I'm really shocked.

40:25.733 --> 40:27.467
Tonight's been fucking mint.

40:27.533 --> 40:30.367
Let's get back to the villa
and continue this party.

40:36.233 --> 40:39.600
That was the best fucking night
that we've had so far.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.200
You are so drunk.
I've never seen you like this.

40:43.267 --> 40:45.733
I haven't got a clue
what I've been drinking,

40:45.800 --> 40:49.133
but I am fucking mortal.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.167
Please get me to bed someone.

40:51.233 --> 40:55.167
I'm never, ever, ever, ever,
ever,
ever, ever, ever, drinking
again.

40:55.233 --> 40:59.800
I'm drinking every night, and
I'll
get in the fucking pool. (all
cheer)

40:59.867 --> 41:02.667
No first night in this villa
would be complete

41:02.733 --> 41:06.567
without a little dip in the
pool,
so everyone, get your kit off.

41:11.667 --> 41:14.333
Steph just pulled Abbie's head
off!
(laughs)

41:14.400 --> 41:16.900
Abbie's dare is to neck on
with Chloe.

41:16.967 --> 41:20.967
We're all mortal and having a
wicked
night, so we start playing
dares.

41:21.033 --> 41:24.067
This might finally help me get
some action with the girls.

41:24.733 --> 41:28.000
So, I stop myself from
necking on with Sam all night,

41:28.067 --> 41:31.300
now I'm necking on with Abbie?
How the hell did this happen?

41:31.367 --> 41:34.067
That's really nice.
Yous look dead cute.

41:34.133 --> 41:37.533
The two girls that I fancy
are both necking on with each
other.

41:37.600 --> 41:40.233
This is fucking mint.
I wish I could just join in.

41:40.300 --> 41:41.300
(laughs)

41:41.367 --> 41:45.067
Our first night in Tenerife
has been a success cos I'm
mortal.

41:45.133 --> 41:48.167
I know that I've left
Chloe and Sam in the pool
together,

41:48.233 --> 41:50.167
but I would like to believe her

41:50.233 --> 41:52.467
when she told me
she wouldn't get with him.

41:54.633 --> 41:56.167
Ow!

41:56.233 --> 41:59.033
I'm mortal, I'm seducing a
umbrella.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.967
I think it's time I go to bed.

42:01.033 --> 42:03.367
This is the final dare.
What?

42:03.433 --> 42:07.400
I dare yous two to not neck on.

42:09.267 --> 42:12.767
Nathan, why would you actually
say,
"Never neck on again"?

42:12.833 --> 42:15.333
Cos that just makes us
want to neck on even more.

42:15.400 --> 42:19.200
I couldn't give a fuck what
Nathan says. He's inside,

42:19.267 --> 42:21.200
and we're outside.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.200
Night.

42:32.033 --> 42:34.700
I know I said I'm going to
stay away from Sam,

42:34.767 --> 42:38.067
but it's just so hard.
I fancy him so much.

42:43.533 --> 42:44.533
Oops.

42:44.600 --> 42:45.933
(laughs)

42:49.133 --> 42:52.200
I love Tenerife.
# Oh, I'm a stotty #

42:52.267 --> 42:54.100
(cheering)
I think we did kiss.

42:54.167 --> 42:57.000
I went... (gasps)
Me and Sam necked on.

42:58.667 --> 43:01.567
Now he's flirting with Abbie.
Who does he think he is?

43:01.633 --> 43:04.467
If you wanna pursue it with him,
you can. Yes!

43:04.533 --> 43:06.933
Me and Sam neck on
behind the curtain.

43:10.367 --> 43:12.133
I am no-one's sloppy seconds.

43:15.367 --> 43:16.700
No, he didn't.

43:17.867 --> 43:20.633
(screams)
You can fuck off.

43:46.400 --> 43:46.600
.
