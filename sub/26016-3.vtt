WEBVTT

00:21.565 --> 00:24.885
Hard at it, Will? That's the spirit.
Got to keep the cash coming in.

00:24.885 --> 00:28.125
I mean, all this ale and pie I'm
quaffing and gorging does not buy
itself.

00:28.125 --> 00:29.205
No, Kit.

00:29.205 --> 00:31.205
And now that thou hast faked
thine own death

00:31.205 --> 00:33.445
and must ever crash upon mine couch,

00:33.445 --> 00:36.085
my household bills soareth most
steeply.

00:36.085 --> 00:39.005
Well, establishing a new identity
takes time.

00:39.005 --> 00:42.565
Yes, particularly if done
from a horizontal position.

00:42.565 --> 00:44.245
What are you writing, then? Another
Henry?

00:44.245 --> 00:46.845
You haven't churned one of those out
in at least a fortnight.

00:46.845 --> 00:50.485
I imagine all London is gagging
for Henry XIX, Part 12.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.725
No, not a history, Kit.

00:52.725 --> 00:54.965
Burbage demands yet another comedy.

00:54.965 --> 00:56.845
I think he's right, people need
escapism.

00:56.845 --> 00:58.325
We're living in dangerous times.

00:58.325 --> 01:00.645
Yeah, look at me -
I got killed in a fight.

01:00.645 --> 01:03.605
And now the hungriest,
thirstiest corpse in Southwark.

01:03.605 --> 01:07.685
Burbage also wants romance,
so I've decided to set the play in
Venice,

01:07.685 --> 01:09.805
city of carnival, city of light.

01:09.805 --> 01:12.045
City of stink, more like. I've been
there.

01:12.045 --> 01:14.845
They've combined the transport
system with the sewage system

01:14.845 --> 01:18.045
and float about
on a shimmering sea of turdingtons.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.725
That's why they're developing
opera -

01:19.725 --> 01:22.005
keeps them breathing through their
mouths.

01:22.005 --> 01:25.965
Well, I certainly can't think
of any other reason for developing
opera.

01:25.965 --> 01:27.165
What's the story, master?

01:27.165 --> 01:28.885
I like a bit of the old soppy stuff.

01:28.885 --> 01:31.965
Well, Portia, a noble lady,
has many suitors,

01:31.965 --> 01:35.125
so her father devises
a brilliant test of character

01:35.125 --> 01:38.005
to discover the right man
for his beloved child.

01:38.005 --> 01:40.845
He hides his permission
in one of three boxes -

01:40.845 --> 01:44.005
a gold box,
a silver box and a lead box.

01:44.005 --> 01:45.325
Now, here's the stunner.

01:45.325 --> 01:47.365
The permission is contained
within...

01:47.365 --> 01:48.925
BOTH: The lead box.
..the lead bo...

01:50.205 --> 01:51.445
How did you know that?

01:51.445 --> 01:53.005
Well, cos it's obvious.

01:53.005 --> 01:54.085
Why?

01:54.085 --> 01:57.125
If you were offered a gold casket,
a silver one or a lead one,

01:57.125 --> 01:58.565
you'd choose the gold one.

01:58.565 --> 02:00.965
Yeah, but you didn't say, "Choose
a casket and you can keep it,"

02:00.965 --> 02:02.525
you said it were a test of
character.

02:02.525 --> 02:05.805
And gloriously, stunningly
obviously, the lucky note's going to
be concealed

02:05.805 --> 02:07.565
in the least showy and ostentatious
box.

02:07.565 --> 02:08.565
Duh!

02:08.565 --> 02:09.925
Well, I think it's brilliant,

02:09.925 --> 02:12.485
and you're just jealous
cos you didn't think of it.

02:12.485 --> 02:14.005
Yeah, well, nor did you, as it
happens.

02:14.005 --> 02:15.125
I bloomin' did!

02:15.125 --> 02:18.045
Sorry, mate, you pinched it
from a collection of medieval
stories

02:18.045 --> 02:19.045
called Gesta Romanorum,

02:19.045 --> 02:21.085
which Kate's reading
and which she leaves in the privy.

02:21.085 --> 02:22.205
Well, I...

02:22.205 --> 02:24.325
..I may have glanced at it

02:24.325 --> 02:25.965
while awaiting the appearance

02:25.965 --> 02:28.405
of that which the cockney
costermongers have,

02:28.405 --> 02:31.765
in tribute to me and in the manner
of their amusing rhyming slang,

02:31.765 --> 02:33.645
termed a Richard III.

02:35.085 --> 02:38.125
Ah! It's cos it rhymes, is it?

02:38.125 --> 02:40.805
I thought it was because
they thought your play was crap.

02:41.925 --> 02:43.005
I kind of think it is.

02:43.005 --> 02:45.205
No, definitely because it rhymes.

02:45.205 --> 02:48.085
And yes, Kit, 'tis possible that,
as I awaited King Richard,

02:48.085 --> 02:52.485
who was as ever late upon his hour
due to a lack of fibre in my diet,

02:52.485 --> 02:55.005
I glanced at this Gesta Romanorum.

02:55.005 --> 02:57.085
Yes, in fact, I do recall now.

02:57.085 --> 02:58.445
I remember thinking,

02:58.445 --> 03:01.645
"Goodness, some medieval fellow had
exactly the same idea for a plot as
me!"

03:01.645 --> 03:04.325
What were the odds?

03:04.325 --> 03:07.205
So, what's this three casket
business got to do with a merchant,
anyway?

03:07.205 --> 03:08.245
Is he Portia's suitor?

03:08.245 --> 03:09.645
No, that's Bassanio.

03:09.645 --> 03:13.085
But Bassanio is too poor to marry
Portia, so he asks his mate,

03:13.085 --> 03:15.805
the merchant Antonio,
to lend him some cash.

03:15.805 --> 03:18.965
Unfortunately, Antonio's cash is
all tied up at sea,

03:18.965 --> 03:20.405
so he has to borrow it

03:20.405 --> 03:23.445
from a kindly old moneylender
called Timothy.

03:25.325 --> 03:29.965
Now, Timothy's daughter Jessica is
in love with Lorenzo, a friend of
Bassanio's...

03:29.965 --> 03:31.925
Nodding off already.

03:31.925 --> 03:35.685
Sorry, mate, it sounds like a right
load of overconvoluted puffling
porridge,

03:35.685 --> 03:36.685
if you ask me.

03:36.685 --> 03:37.845
Yeah, I kind of know.

03:37.845 --> 03:38.885
On the plus side,

03:38.885 --> 03:41.765
overconvoluted puffling porridge
has never let you down before.

03:41.765 --> 03:44.165
But people like a bit of edge,
something new.

03:44.165 --> 03:49.245
I've got a clown called Launcelot
Gobbo, which is a very funny name.

03:49.645 --> 03:51.085
But what else?

03:51.085 --> 03:55.205
I need a big, important, timeless
issue to put at the heart of the new
piece.

03:55.205 --> 03:57.605
But it's not as if
a big, important, timeless issue

03:57.605 --> 03:59.605
is just going to come walking
through the door.

03:59.605 --> 04:01.645
Gosh, that was scary!

04:01.645 --> 04:03.525
But also wonderful,

04:03.525 --> 04:06.725
being part of such a
big, important, timeless issue.

04:06.725 --> 04:08.325
Goodness, Kate, where have you been?

04:08.325 --> 04:09.685
At the anti-immigrant riots.

04:09.685 --> 04:12.205
I've been on the
counterdemonstration,

04:12.205 --> 04:15.445
defending the French and Dutch
refugees who have come here

04:15.445 --> 04:18.285
escaping religious persecution
on the Continent.

04:18.285 --> 04:21.165
It's worse than the Dutch church
riots of 1593.

04:21.165 --> 04:24.205
Yes, I fear anti-European sentiment
is getting worse.

04:25.685 --> 04:27.605
Well, they're everywhere,

04:27.605 --> 04:30.365
talking foreign and eating weird
food...

04:30.365 --> 04:32.325
Soft cheese? What's all that about?!

04:32.325 --> 04:34.605
Cheese is meant to be hard.

04:34.605 --> 04:37.045
When I see soft, runny cheese
for sale at market...

04:37.045 --> 04:40.645
Ugh! ..I feel alienated and
uncomfortable in my own city.

04:40.645 --> 04:43.085
The other day, I was confronted
by a furious crowd

04:43.085 --> 04:45.925
because a woman thought I was
concealing a baguette in my tights.

04:45.925 --> 04:49.205
Yeah. Laughable misunderstanding,
of course.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.205
Just pleased to see her.

04:51.205 --> 04:54.045
The times really are turning ugly.

04:54.045 --> 04:57.485
Our maids and matrons protest group
was continually interrupted

04:57.485 --> 04:59.165
by groups of apprentice boys

04:59.165 --> 05:02.205
demanding that we display to them
our boobingtons

05:02.205 --> 05:03.925
and even threatening our honour.

05:03.925 --> 05:09.005
Strange how some men's considered
response to a woman expressing a
political view

05:12.765 --> 05:14.965
I'm sure that in centuries hence

05:14.965 --> 05:17.245
men will be
sufficiently emotionally mature

05:17.245 --> 05:19.685
to reject such patriarchal
intimidation.

05:19.685 --> 05:21.045
Or, if not,

05:21.045 --> 05:25.565
women will finally begin to stand up
to it and name and shame those
responsible.

05:25.565 --> 05:27.165
Blimey, Kate, have a care.

05:27.165 --> 05:29.685
I mean, that could go
horribly, horribly wrong.

05:29.685 --> 05:32.925
I mean, what of jolly banter?
What of harmless japes and japey
japes?

05:32.925 --> 05:36.725
Why, if women were to set out
on such a chillingly threatening
course,

05:36.725 --> 05:41.085
I mean, men would scarce be able to
admire a pertsome bum-shank,

05:41.085 --> 05:44.125
insist upon an overly long hug
with a junior employee

05:44.125 --> 05:47.405
or make creepy observations
masquerading as compliments

05:47.405 --> 05:48.685
at Christmas parties.

05:48.685 --> 05:51.885
Strangely, I think I could live with
that.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.965
In the meantime,
the only comfort we may take

05:53.965 --> 05:56.405
from this awful anti-European
rioting is that,

05:56.405 --> 05:58.645
if ever such an influx of foreigners
happens again,

05:58.645 --> 06:00.485
Government can prepare for it
properly...

06:02.085 --> 06:05.125
..affording extra funding
for expanded community services

06:05.125 --> 06:07.805
and not simply dumping
the incoming migrants

06:07.805 --> 06:09.205
on the poorest areas.

06:09.205 --> 06:11.445
Yes, at least if
those lessons are learned,

06:11.445 --> 06:13.485
then something good will come of
this.

06:13.485 --> 06:15.325
Meanwhile, I can't talk about
prejudice,

06:15.325 --> 06:17.325
bigotry and intolerance of
minorities all day,

06:17.325 --> 06:19.365
I have to find a big, important
issue

06:19.365 --> 06:21.805
to put at the heart
of my Merchant Of Venice.

06:26.165 --> 06:27.885
What do you think of this?

06:27.885 --> 06:29.925
Antonio, the merchant of Venice,

06:29.925 --> 06:32.405
wants a loan from Timothy,
the moneylender.

06:32.405 --> 06:36.125
Antonio - "Can I borrow 3,000
ducats?"

06:36.125 --> 06:38.405
Timothy - "No problem,
pay me back when you can."

06:39.925 --> 06:43.965
It's almost there, I just think it
needs a bit of edge, a bit of
tension,

06:43.965 --> 06:46.405
some issue which divides them.

06:46.405 --> 06:49.045
Well, you can't be worrying
about divisive issues now, master,

06:49.045 --> 06:52.405
because with all this hatred of
minorities and anti-foreigner
rioting,

06:52.405 --> 06:54.205
you're going to be late for the
theatre,

06:54.205 --> 06:56.325
so you'd better give yourself extra
time.

06:56.325 --> 06:59.205
Yes, you're right, Botsky.
We're auditioning a new actor.

06:59.205 --> 07:00.525
Why not come along, Kate?

07:00.525 --> 07:02.605
I'd value the totty viewpoint.

07:02.605 --> 07:04.605
Oh, I'd love to, Mr Shakespeare!

07:04.605 --> 07:07.685
And good experience for me,
since, as you know,

07:07.685 --> 07:10.965
if ever the law be changed
and as a woman I be allowed to act,

07:10.965 --> 07:13.605
then as a strong woman, who is
strong,

07:13.605 --> 07:17.245
I shall straightway announce
that my real ambition is to direct.

07:18.285 --> 07:20.285
I really admire you for that, Kate.

07:20.285 --> 07:22.925
Got to follow your insane delusions.

07:22.925 --> 07:26.805
I truly believe that if you dare
to have a big enough insane
delusion,

07:26.805 --> 07:29.045
then anything is possible.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.325
Where is Will?

07:33.325 --> 07:37.365
This new actor is expected any
moment and Will is late upon his
hour!

07:37.365 --> 07:41.085
Sorry, the anti-immigrant protests
have closed half the town.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.845
Some say it could be as bad as 1517,

07:43.845 --> 07:46.725
when the blood of butchered
foreigners did flow through London
streets

07:46.725 --> 07:49.245
and Sir Thomas More himself
faced down the mob.

07:49.245 --> 07:51.965
You're so old you were probably
there!

07:51.965 --> 07:55.245
Old fart phobic
or bravely challenging old fart
phobia?

07:55.245 --> 07:56.845
You decide.

07:56.845 --> 07:58.285
Yes... But to business!

07:58.285 --> 08:01.125
We are assembled to consider
acquiring this new player,

08:01.125 --> 08:03.325
who's causing quite a stir.

08:03.325 --> 08:04.525
I've asked Kate along.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.165
I thought it could be useful
to get a woman's perspective.

08:07.165 --> 08:08.565
Such a privilege.

08:08.565 --> 08:11.085
As long as she doesn't try and get
the job herself.

08:11.085 --> 08:12.885
We've seen her girlish tricks
before.

08:12.885 --> 08:15.045
On my honour, sir.

08:15.045 --> 08:17.325
There's no honour when it comes to
getting a part, ducky.

08:17.325 --> 08:20.645
I've torn the coconuts off
more convincing girls than you!

08:20.645 --> 08:23.885
So, what are the qualities we should
be looking for in this actor?

08:23.885 --> 08:26.325
Well, shouting, obviously.

08:26.325 --> 08:28.165
And strutting.

08:28.165 --> 08:32.005
Yes, we're looking for an actor
who can shout and strrrut.

08:36.445 --> 08:38.085
I am the actor Wolf Hall.

08:42.965 --> 08:46.245
But I do not shout and I do not
strut.

08:46.245 --> 08:49.605
I have developed
a revolutionary new style,

08:49.605 --> 08:54.565
subtle, nuanced, emoting from within
by means of long, sad-eyed stares...

08:57.405 --> 09:00.245
...pregnant with weary wisdom

09:00.245 --> 09:01.645
and penetrating perception.

09:04.205 --> 09:05.325
Next!

09:10.205 --> 09:13.045
Stay a moment, Burbage,
he may have something.

09:13.045 --> 09:15.725
Here is my Thomas Wolsey.

09:20.125 --> 09:23.805
And here, by way of contrast,
is my Thomas Cromwell.

09:30.485 --> 09:32.165
Now...

09:32.165 --> 09:34.205
SIGHS

09:34.205 --> 09:36.245
...my Thomas More.

09:41.885 --> 09:44.285
Actually, fair play, he gives good
Thomas.

09:45.445 --> 09:47.965
I must admit, he is subtle and
nuanced.

09:47.965 --> 09:49.645
Those eyes, so sad.

09:49.645 --> 09:53.885
And so pregnant with weary wisdom
and penetrating perception.

09:53.885 --> 09:57.445
I imagine audiences will happily
watch the actor Wolf Hall

09:57.445 --> 10:00.765
stare wearily and wisely
for minutes at a time.

10:00.765 --> 10:04.325
Blimey! If we had him in a show,
my plays would be twice as long.

10:06.285 --> 10:09.125
Richard III would be eight or nine
hours!

10:09.125 --> 10:11.325
How good would that be?

10:11.325 --> 10:13.405
Book him, Mr Burbage. Trust me.

10:13.405 --> 10:16.405
Us brainy birds
will go totally wibbly-wobbly

10:16.405 --> 10:18.005
for an actor like that.

10:18.005 --> 10:20.525
This gal's already a member
of the Wolf pack.

10:20.525 --> 10:21.925
Whoo!

10:22.925 --> 10:25.765
Well, he does have a certain
presence, I admit.

10:25.765 --> 10:28.085
Perhaps in smaller roles.

10:28.085 --> 10:32.885
There are no small roles
for the actor Wolf Hall, Mr Burbage.

10:32.885 --> 10:37.925
With a stare as weary,
penetrating and perceptive as this,

10:38.365 --> 10:41.005
every role is a lead.

10:46.485 --> 10:48.285
The actor Wolf Hall bids you
good day.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.565
God's boobikins,

10:53.565 --> 10:57.525
Shakespeare has found an actor
with eyes so sad and weary

10:57.525 --> 10:59.765
and a stare so astute and
penetrating

10:59.765 --> 11:04.565
that every brainy bird in London
will go wibbly-wobbly.

11:04.565 --> 11:08.205
So, 'tis agreed, this Wolf Hall
shall join our company,

11:08.205 --> 11:11.085
and Mr Shakespeare
will write a little part for him

11:11.085 --> 11:12.765
in his new Venetian comedy.

11:12.765 --> 11:13.885
Absolutely.

11:13.885 --> 11:15.325
Curses!

11:15.325 --> 11:19.165
Such subtle and nuanced acting
would lend wings to the Crow's verse

11:19.165 --> 11:22.245
and increase his fame tenfold.

11:22.245 --> 11:23.645
How can this be stopped?

11:24.645 --> 11:26.285
Well...

11:26.285 --> 11:28.445
If there's one thing I know about
actors,

11:28.445 --> 11:31.165
particularly the subtle and nuanced
kind,

11:31.165 --> 11:33.805
is that because they put on
funny voices for a living,

11:33.805 --> 11:37.485
they be in constant fear
that people will think them thick,

11:37.485 --> 11:39.885
thus will they loudly champion

11:39.885 --> 11:43.165
any exotic theorem or obscure cause
that comes their way

11:43.165 --> 11:46.165
in the mistaken belief
that it'll make them look clever.

11:48.205 --> 11:50.925
I begin to see my way.

11:50.925 --> 11:54.525
But first, Will,
let us to Miss Lucy's tavern,

11:54.525 --> 11:57.365
for we actors have a radical idea
to discuss with you

11:57.365 --> 11:59.005
to help the poor refugees.

12:00.285 --> 12:02.445
A benefit night for the refugees,

12:02.445 --> 12:04.885
with all London's leading theatre
stars?

12:04.885 --> 12:07.325
I think it's a wonderful idea.
Don't you, Miss Lucy?

12:07.325 --> 12:09.365
Oh, yes, Mr Shakespeare.

12:09.365 --> 12:11.805
Although, as an escaped sex worker
myself,

12:11.805 --> 12:14.765
I would say legal status,
safe sanctuary,

12:14.765 --> 12:16.685
ruthless prosecution of people
traffickers

12:16.685 --> 12:19.205
and, above all, a global approach
to the causes of the crisis

12:19.205 --> 12:20.445
would be better.

12:20.445 --> 12:22.205
But in the absence of these,

12:22.205 --> 12:26.005
I'd say a bunch of luvvie-kissies
showing off is as good a start as
any.

12:27.325 --> 12:28.885
Then that's settled.

12:28.885 --> 12:31.325
Yes, well, the concert will need a
title.

12:31.325 --> 12:34.325
A day, I think.
We should name a special day.

12:34.325 --> 12:37.205
Well, many a time
and oft during our touring days

12:37.205 --> 12:40.645
did Condell and I perform
the big red nose gag.

12:40.645 --> 12:44.005
Where I took my inflated pig's
bladder and whacked him on the nose,

12:44.005 --> 12:45.325
causing it to go red.

12:45.325 --> 12:50.165
Brilliant! That's it, we'll call our
day Inflated Pig's Bladder Day.

12:50.165 --> 12:52.565
Ah, good!

12:52.565 --> 12:55.485
LAUGHTER

12:55.485 --> 12:57.485
Oh, it's going brilliantly!

12:57.485 --> 13:00.525
And look! Burbage and Condell
are going to do their joke.

13:00.525 --> 13:03.405
Oh!
LAUGHTER

13:03.405 --> 13:06.045
Oh!

13:06.045 --> 13:09.525
Oh, master, now I'll make thy arse
as red as thy nose!

13:09.525 --> 13:11.285
Oh!

13:11.285 --> 13:13.565
That's so funny!

13:14.765 --> 13:16.565
SERIOUS
Now, recently,

13:16.565 --> 13:19.405
on behalf of
Inflated Pig's Bladder Day,

13:19.405 --> 13:21.885
we visited a refugee area in
Shoreditch.

13:23.285 --> 13:27.725
We saw clogless Dutchmen
begging for cheese and stroopwafel.

13:30.005 --> 13:32.005
Frenchmen so weak with hunger

13:32.005 --> 13:35.405
they had not the strength
to cheat on their wives.

13:35.405 --> 13:39.405
I can't deny that the moments
of harsh, documentary reality

13:39.405 --> 13:41.045
sit rather uncomfortably

13:41.045 --> 13:43.805
against the hilarity
of the bum-kicking gags.

13:43.805 --> 13:47.245
Yes, it does feel like
rather a strange juxtaposition.

13:47.245 --> 13:49.405
Still, the benefit night
is a new art form.

13:49.405 --> 13:51.925
No doubt in future ages they'll have
found a way round that one.

13:51.925 --> 13:54.165
You've got to hope so.

13:54.165 --> 13:59.245
Which means that we have raised
the amazing amount of...

14:05.125 --> 14:06.965
Thank you, London!

14:06.965 --> 14:09.285
Thank you!

14:09.285 --> 14:11.165
Well, sounds like an amazing result.

14:11.165 --> 14:13.285
I mean, I wish I wasn't in hiding
and could have been there.

14:13.285 --> 14:15.045
Nearly £5!
That's a hell of a lot!

14:15.045 --> 14:16.445
ALL: Hey!

14:16.445 --> 14:17.765
Although, not so much

14:17.765 --> 14:20.405
if you consider
that a full great ship of the line

14:20.405 --> 14:22.205
cost the Exchequer about 2,000.

14:22.205 --> 14:24.405
Well, you hear a lot
of that sort of argument

14:24.405 --> 14:26.045
from gloomy naysayers, Miss Lucy,

14:26.045 --> 14:27.685
but five quid's five quid,

14:27.685 --> 14:29.285
and without tonight's benefit,

14:29.285 --> 14:30.725
all we'd have would be nothing.

14:30.725 --> 14:32.525
ALL: Hey!

14:32.525 --> 14:35.205
Except that maybe,
without charity nights like tonight,

14:35.205 --> 14:37.365
people wouldn't be able to think
they'd achieved something

14:37.365 --> 14:39.885
when, really, nothing's changed
at all.

14:39.885 --> 14:42.525
And without that comforting
illusion, they might be more minded

14:42.525 --> 14:46.325
to agitate for genuine political
change, which could make an actual
difference.

14:46.325 --> 14:50.845
I mean, you could argue that charity
affords politicians an excuse for
inaction

14:50.845 --> 14:53.485
and exploiters the pretence
of a conscience.

14:55.685 --> 14:57.965
Still, we raised nearly £5!

14:57.965 --> 15:00.245
ALL: Hey!

15:00.245 --> 15:02.365
But it would be wonderful
to do something more

15:02.365 --> 15:05.045
than just raise money,
don't you think, Mr Shakespeare?

15:05.045 --> 15:07.525
Something profound and timeless,

15:07.525 --> 15:09.965
a lasting reflection
on the corrosive nature

15:09.965 --> 15:11.565
of bigotry and intolerance.

15:11.565 --> 15:14.685
Well, that is undoubtedly true,
but I'm also very busy, Kate.

15:14.685 --> 15:17.245
I'm looking for a truly timeless
and universal issue

15:17.245 --> 15:18.845
to elevate my Merchant Of Venice.

15:21.085 --> 15:22.565
Hang on...

15:22.565 --> 15:25.365
Hang the futtock on!

15:25.365 --> 15:28.405
Mr Hall, if you join the Burbage
company

15:28.405 --> 15:31.565
with your extraordinarily sad
but kindly eyes

15:31.565 --> 15:33.685
and weary, perceptive stare,

15:33.685 --> 15:35.725
you will without a doubt soon become

15:35.725 --> 15:39.125
one of the greatest Shakespearean
players of your day.

15:39.125 --> 15:40.445
That much is certain.

15:40.445 --> 15:42.205
Hm.

15:42.205 --> 15:44.685
This Shakespeare...

15:44.685 --> 15:47.325
A curious thing, is he not?

15:47.325 --> 15:48.925
I mean, who could have imagined

15:48.925 --> 15:52.565
that a mere town-school
spotty-grotty could write such
verse?

15:52.565 --> 15:55.205
That a turnip-chewing, country
bum-shankle

15:55.205 --> 15:58.445
could produce such insight
and such wisdom?

15:58.445 --> 16:00.685
'Tis passing strange. Mm...

16:00.685 --> 16:02.365
One might almost imagine

16:02.365 --> 16:04.365
that some educated posh boy

16:04.365 --> 16:07.005
had writ his plays in secret.

16:07.005 --> 16:12.205
I don't know, a university man like
Sir Francis Bacon or the Earl of
Oxford.

16:12.765 --> 16:14.845
Interesting. Fascinating.

16:14.845 --> 16:17.165
Or Christopher Marlowe, perhaps!

16:17.165 --> 16:19.525
They say he's dead, but is he?

16:19.525 --> 16:22.245
The actor Wolf Hall is intrigued.

16:22.245 --> 16:27.205
He takes the bait, and thus do I
prove one of the great truths of
life and art,

16:27.325 --> 16:31.205
that just because an actor looks
intelligent and can play intelligent

16:31.205 --> 16:34.525
doesn't mean that he is intelligent.

16:38.885 --> 16:42.565
I wonder how Susanna's getting on
with her first day at work.

16:42.565 --> 16:44.165
I'm so proud of her.

16:44.165 --> 16:48.245
Well, I don't think it's fitting,
a maid teaching in a dame school.

16:48.245 --> 16:50.325
Oh, she's only helping out
with the younger ones,

16:50.325 --> 16:52.165
reading and writing.

16:52.165 --> 16:54.445
The responsibility'll do her good,

16:54.445 --> 16:57.005
stop her being
such a grumpy little bitchington.

16:57.005 --> 16:58.845
Where's my tea? I'm starving!

16:58.845 --> 17:00.005
I had to walk home.

17:00.005 --> 17:03.085
Why couldn't Grandad pick me up
in the cart? What's he do all day?

17:03.085 --> 17:06.245
Nothing! I hate my life! Shut up!

17:07.325 --> 17:08.565
Long day, love?

17:08.565 --> 17:11.205
What is this, the Star Chamber?
You're always on at me!

17:11.205 --> 17:14.245
Yes, it was a long day. You happy
now? Shut up!

17:14.245 --> 17:16.685
I actually think
she might be improving a bit.

17:16.685 --> 17:18.725
Well, tell us a bit about it.

17:18.725 --> 17:20.205
Were the boys nice?

17:20.205 --> 17:23.285
No, they're a bunch
of nasty little swine.

17:23.285 --> 17:25.125
There's this one kid
who's a bit different,

17:25.125 --> 17:28.485
you know, what they call a holy
innocent, and they are so mean to
him.

17:28.485 --> 17:30.885
We had a boy like that in my class.

17:30.885 --> 17:32.125
Brilliant!

17:32.125 --> 17:34.125
We used to call him stupid.

17:34.125 --> 17:35.445
Wasn't any harm in it.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.005
We used to play tricks on him.

17:37.005 --> 17:38.525
Wasn't any harm in it.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.405
We used to steal his lunch,

17:40.405 --> 17:41.565
chuck him in the pond

17:41.565 --> 17:45.765
and reduce him to a weeping,
sobbing wretch in the corner.

17:45.765 --> 17:46.925
Wasn't any...

17:48.045 --> 17:49.405
..harm in it.

17:50.805 --> 17:52.845
Actually, when I think about it,

17:52.845 --> 17:55.085
there was quite a lot of harm in it,

17:55.085 --> 17:57.125
which is why I try not to think
about it.

17:58.685 --> 18:01.285
So thanks a lot for bringing it up,
Susanna!

18:01.285 --> 18:05.805
My class is full of insensitive
bastables like Grandad was.

18:05.805 --> 18:07.885
I just wish there was a way
I could make them see

18:07.885 --> 18:10.045
that this kid has
exactly the same feelings

18:10.045 --> 18:12.685
and exactly the same human value
as they do.

18:12.685 --> 18:14.965
Well, maybe you should speak
to your father about it.

18:14.965 --> 18:18.845
He can be very astute
on matters of human nature.

18:18.845 --> 18:21.365
He knows a bit about being bullied,
too.

18:21.365 --> 18:24.165
He started going bald when he was
seven.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.885
I'll put an outsider at the centre
of my Venice play -

18:28.885 --> 18:30.405
despised and belittled.

18:30.405 --> 18:33.485
I'll make him the moneylender
and create an iconic figure

18:33.485 --> 18:37.565
who will stand for all time
as an affront to prejudice and
bigotry.

18:37.565 --> 18:39.605
Such a brilliant idea!

18:39.605 --> 18:40.965
I can't deny, it seems strong.

18:40.965 --> 18:42.805
So what type of outsider
are you going to make him?

18:42.805 --> 18:44.445
Well, isn't it obvious?

18:44.445 --> 18:47.085
I'll make the moneylender a
Dutchman.

18:49.285 --> 18:51.165
These riots are about European
refugees,

18:51.165 --> 18:52.365
and I can't go French

18:52.365 --> 18:56.405
because even my huge brain would
struggle to find sympathetic
qualities there.

18:56.405 --> 18:58.645
So Dutch it is.

18:58.645 --> 19:03.165
Laas, a villainous
but ultimately deeply human
Dutchman.

19:03.165 --> 19:05.165
A tall, blond man in clogs

19:05.165 --> 19:07.605
fond of rubbery cheese
and high-quality beer,

19:07.605 --> 19:11.685
yet somehow managing to maintain
a trim and attractive figure.

19:11.685 --> 19:14.805
Isn't it brilliant?
Hm, I'm not sure.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.725
Then it's a good thing I'm the
genius, isn't it?

19:16.725 --> 19:19.605
So, Antonio has asked for his loan,

19:19.605 --> 19:21.605
and Dutch Laas is reflecting on the
fact

19:21.605 --> 19:26.285
that this same Antonio has insulted
him and plotted against him on the
rialto.

19:26.285 --> 19:27.925
Kate, read it out for me.

19:27.925 --> 19:29.605
You have something of the subtlety

19:29.605 --> 19:31.685
that I believe Wolf Hall
will bring to the role.

19:34.205 --> 19:39.045
DUTCH ACCENT: You hath disgraced
me, laughed at my losses, mocked at
my gains,

19:39.045 --> 19:43.845
scorned at my nation...
And what's his reason? I am Dutch.

19:43.845 --> 19:45.685
ALL STIFLE LAUGHTER

19:48.285 --> 19:51.325
Excuse me, but, Bottom, Marlowe,
why are you laughing?

19:51.325 --> 19:52.685
Sorry, can't help it.

19:52.685 --> 19:54.005
It's the accent.

19:54.005 --> 19:57.165
I beg your pardon,
I do a very good Dutch accent.

19:57.165 --> 20:00.805
It just seems to play against
the timeless majesty of the poetry.

20:00.805 --> 20:02.285
Well, surely that's the whole point.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.685
People are alienated by things
they're unfamiliar with

20:04.685 --> 20:06.085
and thus despise them.

20:06.085 --> 20:08.285
Kate, please, proceed.

20:08.285 --> 20:09.605
CLEARS THROAT

20:09.605 --> 20:12.205
RESUMES ACCENT
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

20:12.205 --> 20:15.045
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

20:15.045 --> 20:18.285
If you poison us, do we not die?

20:18.285 --> 20:21.525
And if you wrong us, shall we not
revenge?

20:21.525 --> 20:24.365
DUTCH ACCENT: Actually, Mr
Shakespeare...

20:24.365 --> 20:26.085
NORMAL VOICE: Actually, Mr
Shakespeare,

20:26.085 --> 20:29.245
it is quite difficult to get the
required gravitas doing it Dutch.

20:29.245 --> 20:31.885
Yeah, and the clogs are going to
make a terrible racket on the stage!

20:31.885 --> 20:33.445
Also, it strikes me that,

20:33.445 --> 20:35.725
if you still want to set the play
in Venice,

20:35.725 --> 20:37.165
that doesn't work either.

20:37.165 --> 20:38.805
The Venetians don't hate the Dutch.

20:38.805 --> 20:42.285
In fact, Holland's maritime success
has made them trading partners.

20:42.285 --> 20:44.285
Yeah, to be fair, Will,
this anti-Dutch thing

20:44.285 --> 20:45.725
is pretty recent, even in Britain.

20:45.725 --> 20:47.325
I mean, they've been our allies
in the past.

20:47.325 --> 20:49.565
People only hate the Dutch at the
moment.

20:49.565 --> 20:51.165
Damn! You're right.

20:51.165 --> 20:56.045
If I'm to create a timeless classic,
I need a group that everybody
persecutes,

20:56.045 --> 20:57.445
a people who truly encapsulate

20:57.445 --> 21:00.805
the eternal nature of ignorant
prejudice and bigotry.

21:00.805 --> 21:02.165
But who can it be?

21:02.165 --> 21:03.605
A ginge?

21:06.085 --> 21:09.285
Yes, Bottom. Absolutely, a ginge
would be perfect.

21:09.285 --> 21:11.885
Carrot Top,
the ginger moneylender of Venice.

21:11.885 --> 21:13.725
The play will write itself.

21:13.725 --> 21:15.925
Except, hang on, there is
one thing -

21:15.925 --> 21:17.205
the Queen's a ginge.

21:17.205 --> 21:18.805
Mr Shakespeare,

21:18.805 --> 21:21.485
we can avoid the obvious no longer.

21:21.485 --> 21:25.285
We seek a people who are universally
vilified and despised.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.605
There can be only one contender.

21:27.605 --> 21:28.845
Of course,

21:28.845 --> 21:29.845
a Scot!

21:31.005 --> 21:33.325
Don't be ridiculous, Mr Shakespeare.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.285
How can anyone dislike the Scots?

21:35.285 --> 21:38.525
They are perfect in every way,
as they keep telling us.

21:38.525 --> 21:41.125
Think about it, Mr Shakespeare.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.365
What we've learned from the riots
here in London

21:43.365 --> 21:45.245
is that people blame their troubles

21:45.245 --> 21:47.685
on any convenient minority
living amongst them,

21:47.685 --> 21:49.685
and there's one group of people

21:49.685 --> 21:52.365
who are always in the minority
wherever they go.

21:52.365 --> 21:55.965
It's time for another big Jew play.

21:59.525 --> 22:02.085
I am to give my Jew once more.

22:02.085 --> 22:04.485
Oh, joy! Oh, joy!

22:04.485 --> 22:06.445
I shall have a new prop nose built -

22:06.445 --> 22:08.885
huge and hooked and warty.

22:08.885 --> 22:12.045
And I shall hiss and lurk and prowl.

22:12.045 --> 22:16.325
And I'll have a stock of prop babies
hidden beneath my black, sinister
gown,

22:16.325 --> 22:19.125
from which I shall drink stage
blood!

22:19.125 --> 22:23.605
Mr Burbage, the character is
supposed to be at least partially
sympathetic.

22:23.605 --> 22:26.245
Sympathetic Jew? Ha! Are you mad?!

22:26.245 --> 22:29.205
Such a thing has ne'er been known
in all European culture.

22:29.205 --> 22:31.205
That's what's going to make the play
so memorable.

22:31.205 --> 22:35.325
Oh, so do you think I should tone
down the baby blood-drinking bit
or...?

22:35.325 --> 22:37.245
Yes, well, that's kind of the
point.

22:37.245 --> 22:40.485
We're trying to rewrite the rules a
bit on stage Jews here.

22:40.485 --> 22:42.885
Speaking of which,
all this "do we not bleed" stuff,

22:42.885 --> 22:44.645
as if they're the same as us,

22:44.645 --> 22:46.765
I presume you want me to play that
for laughs.

22:46.765 --> 22:48.805
Laughs? Yes, it's a joke.

22:48.805 --> 22:50.885
Obviously, Jews are not the same
as us.

22:50.885 --> 22:53.285
They are a wicked, naughty people.

22:53.285 --> 22:56.805
They drink the blood of Christian
babies and they poison Christian
wells.

22:56.805 --> 23:00.165
They deliberately created
and spread bubonic plague - fact.

23:00.165 --> 23:03.245
But have you ever actually seen
any of these things?

23:03.245 --> 23:05.645
Are you suggesting
all this stuff is made up?

23:05.645 --> 23:06.965
Well, you have to wonder.

23:06.965 --> 23:10.325
I mean, they're supposed to secretly
run the world for their own
advantage.

23:10.325 --> 23:14.205
Well, if that's true, quite frankly,
they're not doing much of a job,
are they?

23:14.205 --> 23:17.285
I mean, they get hounded, beaten
and murdered wherever they go.

23:17.285 --> 23:19.685
Hath not a Jew eyes?

23:19.685 --> 23:21.405
Hath not a Jew hands,

23:21.405 --> 23:23.285
organs,

23:23.285 --> 23:25.365
dimensions, senses,

23:25.365 --> 23:27.805
affections, passions?

23:27.805 --> 23:29.845
Fed with the same food,

23:29.845 --> 23:32.365
hurt with the same weapons,

23:32.365 --> 23:34.685
subject to the same diseases,

23:34.685 --> 23:36.565
healed by the same means,

23:36.565 --> 23:41.605
warmed and cooled by the same winter
and summer as a Christian is?

23:43.045 --> 23:45.685
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

23:45.685 --> 23:48.805
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

23:48.805 --> 23:52.005
If you poison us, do we not die?

23:53.285 --> 23:55.405
And if you wrong us,

23:55.405 --> 23:57.885
shall we not revenge?

23:59.285 --> 24:03.125
Mr Burbage, Wolf Hall must play
the Jew!

24:03.125 --> 24:05.005
I'm sorry, that's impossible.

24:05.005 --> 24:07.005
I, Burbage, always play the
title role.

24:07.005 --> 24:09.845
Oh, well, that's all right, then.
The title role is Antonio.

24:09.845 --> 24:13.325
Antonio? Yes, Antonio is the
merchant of Venice.

24:13.325 --> 24:16.365
Really? No-one's ever going to get
that. Ever.

24:18.045 --> 24:21.885
For evermore, people will presume
Shylock is the merchant of Venice.

24:21.885 --> 24:23.725
Well, he isn't. Antonio is.

24:23.725 --> 24:24.885
Very well,

24:24.885 --> 24:27.725
then I shall give my Antonio.

24:27.725 --> 24:30.645
And Mr Hall will play the Jew,

24:30.645 --> 24:33.685
my most startlingly nuanced
creation to date.

24:33.685 --> 24:35.645
A villainous character, of course,

24:35.645 --> 24:38.525
but also with human emotions
and even nobility.

24:38.525 --> 24:41.725
Wolf Hall, it is an honour
to have you in my play.

24:41.725 --> 24:43.125
Yes, it is.

24:43.125 --> 24:46.845
Oh, although, of course,
it isn't your play.

24:46.845 --> 24:48.005
Not my play?

24:48.005 --> 24:49.485
You didn't write it.

24:49.485 --> 24:51.165
Nor indeed any of your plays.

24:51.165 --> 24:53.485
What?
'Twas another scribe, I'm certain.

24:53.485 --> 24:55.085
A posh boy, no doubt?

24:55.085 --> 24:57.965
Didn't write my plays?
That's insane!

24:57.965 --> 25:00.605
Burbage, Condell, Kempe,
back me up here.

25:00.605 --> 25:02.045
Well, of course!

25:02.045 --> 25:04.405
But now it's been said, Will,

25:04.405 --> 25:06.045
it's hard to get out of your mind.

25:06.045 --> 25:07.245
I mean, innit weird?

25:07.245 --> 25:10.165
We've seen you write bits of them,
but now doubt's been put in my mind,

25:10.165 --> 25:11.605
um, you know...

25:11.605 --> 25:15.045
I can't help wondering if all that
proof is actually evidence

25:15.045 --> 25:17.085
of a vast conspiracy to hide the
truth.

25:17.085 --> 25:18.285
That you...

25:18.285 --> 25:19.525
..did not...

25:20.565 --> 25:22.165
..write your plays.

25:23.445 --> 25:25.005
Shut up!

25:25.005 --> 25:26.765
Shut up, stop saying it!

25:26.765 --> 25:28.765
By St Thomas's tiny testicles,

25:28.765 --> 25:31.645
the more you say it,
the more I must needs debunk it,

25:31.645 --> 25:35.805
yet the very process of debunking it
lends credibility to the lie.

25:35.805 --> 25:38.805
Get out! I ban you from my
plays forever.

25:38.805 --> 25:41.285
You can go and do panto in the
provinces.

25:41.285 --> 25:42.965
How very rude!

25:44.565 --> 25:46.605
I was only expressing reasonable
doubt.

25:53.525 --> 25:56.245
The actor Wolf Hall bids you
goodbye.

25:57.885 --> 26:01.165
Well, Will, looks like you're in
need of a stage Jew.

26:01.165 --> 26:03.725
Shylock is still not the title role,
Burbage.

26:03.725 --> 26:05.845
The merchant of Venice is Antonio.

26:05.845 --> 26:09.325
Will, believe me, no-one is ever,
ever going to get that.

26:11.525 --> 26:12.725
Argh!

26:12.725 --> 26:14.805
EXAGGERATED JEWISH ACCENT
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

26:14.805 --> 26:17.405
If you poison us, do we not die?

26:17.405 --> 26:22.285
And if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?!

26:22.285 --> 26:25.325
Oy vey, oy vey, oy vey...

26:25.325 --> 26:26.605
Argh!

26:26.605 --> 26:29.845
AUDIENCE BOOS

26:29.845 --> 26:32.245
Looks like promoting tolerance
and understanding

26:32.245 --> 26:34.685
might be a bit of a bigger project
than we thought.

26:34.685 --> 26:36.085
Yes, Mr Shakespeare.

26:36.085 --> 26:38.125
I fear it may be a long time

26:38.125 --> 26:42.205
before the play's message of
inclusiveness and tolerance finds an
audience.

26:42.205 --> 26:45.045
Actually, I'm not so sure.
My daughter Susanna has asked

26:45.045 --> 26:48.005
if she might use a passage from it
as a teaching aid.

26:48.005 --> 26:49.845
Settle down!

26:51.165 --> 26:53.925
As you know, my dad's famous,

26:53.925 --> 26:56.285
and he's given me one of his
speeches to be recited

26:56.285 --> 26:59.565
for the next village gladsome
gadabout, to raise money for the
school.

26:59.565 --> 27:03.525
And I have chosen one of you to
recite it.

27:03.525 --> 27:05.965
Up you get, Rodney.

27:05.965 --> 27:07.805
SNICKERING

27:12.045 --> 27:14.205
Hath I not eyes?

27:14.205 --> 27:19.205
Have I not hands, organs,
dimensions, senses,

27:19.325 --> 27:22.725
affections, passions?

27:22.725 --> 27:26.085
Fed with the same food,

27:26.085 --> 27:29.165
hurt with the same weapons?

27:29.165 --> 27:32.365
If you prick me, do I not bleed?

27:32.365 --> 27:35.805
If you tickle me, do I not laugh?

27:35.805 --> 27:38.325
If you poison me, do I not die?

27:44.365 --> 27:45.765
Nice one, Rodney.

27:51.245 --> 27:54.085
There's some lovely stuff in that
play, Will.

27:54.085 --> 27:57.325
And those lines Rodney said,
they were beautiful.

27:57.325 --> 28:01.125
And of course it represents
a game-changing moment in world
culture.

28:01.125 --> 28:02.245
You think?

28:02.245 --> 28:03.445
Oh, no doubt about it.

28:03.445 --> 28:06.525
In creating the world's first
slightly sympathetic Jew,

28:06.525 --> 28:08.725
I have set humanity upon a path

28:08.725 --> 28:10.365
which must lead inevitably

28:10.365 --> 28:14.965
to a world of universal tolerance,
peace, love and understanding.

28:14.965 --> 28:16.445
I am literally that good.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.205
Course you are, love.

28:19.845 --> 28:22.605
Do you know, I don't think
your hair's receding at all.

28:22.605 --> 28:23.725
Really, my sweet?

28:23.725 --> 28:25.045
That's encouraging.

28:25.045 --> 28:26.405
No, what's happened is...

28:26.405 --> 28:27.805
..your head's got bigger.
