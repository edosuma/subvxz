if I got a role that would

25:20.000 --> 25:21.206
but I'm not sure
which one to use

25:21.206 --> 25:22.448

coming up, you know.

25:22.448 --> 25:24.206
I mean the line is
get out of here,

25:24.206 --> 25:25.724
don't you ever come back, right.

25:25.724 --> 25:27.827

I could go pretty sexy,

25:27.827 --> 25:30.068
I was like get out of
here, don't ever come back.

25:30.068 --> 25:33.103
That's not
intimidating, all right.

25:33.103 --> 25:35.275
So like, so I'm an American
like yo get outta here

25:35.275 --> 25:36.827

thing off your head.

Be proud of it.

25:53.793 --> 25:56.620
- Yeah, mom, well, you
don't like any of my wigs

25:56.620 --> 25:58.965
and you don't even
understand the politics

25:58.965 --> 26:01.137
here in America,
so, with this hair

26:01.137 --> 26:04.034
I'm more marketable
and I might get a job.

28:13.034 --> 28:15.000
It's my first big
set and we're working

28:15.000 --> 28:17.344
with a real time director
and look at this.

28:17.344 --> 28:19.551
It's coming in on me
and I'm claustrophobic.

28:19.551 --> 28:22.034
- [Bailey] Remember that
you've been training for this.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.379
This is everything
that you've wanted,

28:23.379 --> 28:26.206
so you know just
bring it back in.

28:27.517 --> 28:28.586

Yes.

28:52.896 --> 28:54.034
- Here you go.

28:55.172 --> 28:57.241
- Suddenly I don't feel
as nervous anymore.

28:57.241 --> 29:00.448
- I'm glad I could
take your nerves away.

29:00.448 --> 29:01.413
Okay?

29:01.413 --> 29:02.413

29:02.413 --> 29:03.862
I just gotta keep breathing.

being the star

29:15.068 --> 29:15.931
of a commercial, right?

29:15.931 --> 29:16.931
- No.

29:16.931 --> 29:18.448
No, I'm no star,
but I will enjoy

29:18.448 --> 29:19.689
the star treatment
while it lasts.

29:19.689 --> 29:20.689

29:20.689 --> 29:23.275
Just focus on nailing it.

- So, do you have
any family here?

31:49.827 --> 31:52.034
- No, no, no it's just me.

31:52.034 --> 31:54.758
The rest of my family's

31:54.758 --> 31:56.000
- Yeah.

friend Travis, though.

31:57.931 --> 31:59.379
- Okay.

31:59.379 --> 32:00.931

32:00.931 --> 32:04.000
Him and his cousin Dante
let me sleep in their couch.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.241
It's a pretty nice couch.

32:06.241 --> 32:07.482
- Okay.

- I believe you.

32:09.241 --> 32:10.241
- How about you?

32:10.241 --> 32:11.793
- Pretty much the same story.

32:11.793 --> 32:14.896
My best friend is
from South Africa.

32:14.896 --> 32:17.931
Her name's Monica and
then there is Sheena

32:17.931 --> 32:20.689
and when I got here they
pretty much just, you know,

32:20.689 --> 32:24.620
took me in, so it's like
sisters from another mother.

32:24.620 --> 32:29.034
- You know Monica seems just
about as crazy as Dante.

32:30.620 --> 32:32.000
- I beg to differ.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.379
You don't know Monica.

32:33.379 --> 32:34.655
- You don't know Dante.

32:34.655 --> 32:35.931
- That's a different
type of crazy.

1:00:59.689 --> 1:01:01.137
better than yours.

1:01:02.103 --> 1:01:03.896
- You're funny.

1:01:03.896 --> 1:01:04.931
- But you know actually
what, I'm not sorry.

1:01:04.931 --> 1:01:06.448
I'm not.

1:01:06.448 --> 1:01:10.137
Because I have absolutely
nothing to apologize for.

1:01:11.068 --> 1:01:12.551
- I, I know it's
hard to believe,

1:01:12.551 --> 1:01:15.068
but the world does not
revolve around you Chance.

1:01:15.068 --> 1:01:17.517
- I never said it did Bailey.

1:01:19.275 --> 1:01:21.896
- Okay, so, so that's why
you're acting like this.

1:01:21.896 --> 1:01:23.034
You're acting like hot
shit because you are

1:01:23.034 --> 1:01:24.689
now a working actor.

1:01:24.689 --> 1:01:26.344
- Well, isn't that the point?

1:01:26.344 --> 1:01:27.793
Isn't that what it's all about,

1:01:27.793 --> 1:01:30.965
being a working actor as
opposed to an inspiring actor.

1:01:30.965 --> 1:01:33.551
You've never been happy
for me Bailey, ever.

1:01:33.551 --> 1:01:37.896
You just as fake as these
wigs you put on your head.

1:01:39.206 --> 1:01:40.206
- Just wait.

1:01:41.068 --> 1:01:43.000
You need to wait with that.

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.896
Because I've always been there.

1:01:44.896 --> 1:01:46.068
I've never left your side

1:01:46.068 --> 1:01:47.620
and I've never hated on you.

1:01:47.620 --> 1:01:49.344
I'm happy for you Chance.

1:01:49.344 --> 1:01:51.000
- Well, I don't feel it.

1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:55.172
I don't see it, which says
a lot about your acting.

1:01:58.310 --> 1:01:59.793
- You think you're
the good actor.

1:01:59.793 --> 1:02:00.793
- Well, obviously.

1:02:00.793 --> 1:02:02.896
I'm booking all the jobs.

1:02:02.896 --> 1:02:04.862
- I wonder how you're doing it?

1:02:04.862 --> 1:02:06.758
Because you're never
remember your lines,

1:02:06.758 --> 1:02:07.758
you always look into camera,

1:02:07.758 --> 1:02:08.965
you forget your mark.

1:02:08.965 --> 1:02:10.241
I'm the one that
helps you with that.

1:02:10.241 --> 1:02:11.724
- This is ridiculous.

1:02:11.724 --> 1:02:12.862
If I was so terrible,
then why did Terri Vaughn

1:02:12.862 --> 1:02:14.344
book me in her next film?

1:02:14.344 --> 1:02:16.344
- I don't know, let's think
about that for a second

1:02:16.344 --> 1:02:18.793
how you actually got that job.

1:02:18.793 --> 1:02:20.896
Because we all know how you
are with the ladies, right,

1:02:20.896 --> 1:02:22.413
and she must like
you and we all know

1:02:22.413 --> 1:02:24.620
how much you love couches.

1:02:27.137 --> 1:02:28.241
- Oh, really.

1:02:29.724 --> 1:02:32.620
Bailey, you need to think
long and hard about your life.

1:02:32.620 --> 1:02:34.137
You need to reconsider
a few things.

1:02:34.137 --> 1:02:35.827
You need to be brutally
honest with yourself

1:02:35.827 --> 1:02:37.379
because if you were,
you'd understand

1:02:37.379 --> 1:02:38.827
that it's not working
out for you here.

1:02:38.827 --> 1:02:40.551
So you need to pack
all your things

1:02:40.551 --> 1:02:42.448
and go back to South Africa.

1:02:42.448 --> 1:02:44.206
Stop wasting your
parents' money.

1:02:44.206 --> 1:02:46.379
Stop wasting my time.

1:02:46.379 --> 1:02:47.620
Because I'm tired.

1:02:47.620 --> 1:02:49.103
You are weighing me down.

1:02:49.103 --> 1:02:51.137
You know how much further
I would be in my career

1:02:51.137 --> 1:02:53.896
if I wasn't dragging
your jealous hating,

1:02:53.896 --> 1:02:56.758
wannabe self all the damn time?

1:02:56.758 --> 1:02:57.620
Dammit man.

1:03:10.206 --> 1:03:11.034
- Monica.

1:03:12.310 --> 1:03:15.000
Monica and Sheena, take me home.

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.827
Take me home.

1:03:19.827 --> 1:03:21.206
Take me home now.

1:03:23.758 --> 1:03:24.586
Now.

1:03:25.862 --> 1:03:27.827
- I'm, I'm gonna get the keys.

1:03:27.827 --> 1:03:28.655
Move, boo.

1:03:41.586 --> 1:03:43.448
- What's up on this food,
though, we gonna eat?

1:03:43.448 --> 1:03:45.413
- Yeah, I'm quite hungry.

1:03:45.413 --> 1:03:46.413
- What?

1:03:46.413 --> 1:03:47.965
- You speak English.

1:03:47.965 --> 1:03:48.965
- You talk.

1:03:48.965 --> 1:03:50.137
- It is what it is homey.

1:03:50.137 --> 1:03:51.931
- And I'm your homey.

1:03:52.965 --> 1:03:54.172
I'm your homey.

1:03:54.172 --> 1:03:55.379
- Man, I done seen it all,

1:03:55.379 --> 1:03:56.862
I done heard it all.

1:03:56.862 --> 1:03:58.517
- You think if an African
actor wants to make it

1:03:58.517 --> 1:04:00.551
in Hollywood, then
they can speak English.

1:04:00.551 --> 1:04:01.517
- You what.

1:04:01.517 --> 1:04:02.931
What it?

1:04:02.931 --> 1:04:03.862
- [Travis] So you
understood every time we?

1:04:03.862 --> 1:04:05.275
- You up for some fried chicken.

1:04:05.275 --> 1:04:06.862
- [Dante] And he
want fried chicken.

1:04:06.862 --> 1:04:08.310
- Go fix my plate, hurry up.

1:04:08.310 --> 1:04:09.551
- I got some words
to say to you.

1:04:09.551 --> 1:04:12.379
- Man, what's fixin'
to happen next.

1:04:12.379 --> 1:04:15.379
[sad soulful music]

1:04:26.931 --> 1:04:29.068
[sobbing]

1:04:48.862 --> 1:04:49.689
- Dammit.

1:04:51.241 --> 1:04:53.344
This makes no damn sense.

1:05:08.758 --> 1:05:10.448
[screaming]

1:05:10.448 --> 1:05:12.965
[funky music]

1:05:21.379 --> 1:05:22.517
Good day, ma'am, how are you?

1:05:22.517 --> 1:05:23.448
- Hi.

1:05:23.448 --> 1:05:24.655
- My name's Chance Crawford.

1:05:24.655 --> 1:05:27.068
And I have a meeting
with Miss Terri Vaughn.

1:05:27.068 --> 1:05:28.413
- Why don't you have a seat.

1:05:28.413 --> 1:05:29.413
- [Chance] Right here?

1:05:29.413 --> 1:05:30.413
- Yes, right there.

1:05:30.413 --> 1:05:31.413
- You look very nice today.

1:05:31.413 --> 1:05:33.931
[funky music]

1:05:55.724 --> 1:05:56.793
- Miss Vaughn would
like to see you now.

1:05:56.793 --> 1:05:58.413
- Oh, great, great.

1:05:58.413 --> 1:05:59.241
Thank you.

1:06:02.620 --> 1:06:04.000
- No, really, really, really,

1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:05.793
it would be so great
if we Meryl Street

1:06:05.793 --> 1:06:07.620
with that actor that
played Pooty Tang.

1:06:07.620 --> 1:06:08.965
Do you remember?

1:06:08.965 --> 1:06:10.413
I can't remember his name.

1:06:10.413 --> 1:06:14.931
Yeah, no, it's Terri J.
Vaughn, J. Terry J. Vaughn.

1:06:14.931 --> 1:06:15.931
[knocking]

1:06:15.931 --> 1:06:16.862
Yeah, okay.

1:06:17.965 --> 1:06:18.793
Thank you.

1:06:20.448 --> 1:06:22.482
I hate when people
forger the J, hi.

1:06:22.482 --> 1:06:23.793
- Hi.

1:06:23.793 --> 1:06:25.034
- Thanks for coming.

1:06:25.034 --> 1:06:26.965
- Thank you, thank you.

1:06:26.965 --> 1:06:28.103
- How's your girlfriend?

1:06:28.103 --> 1:06:28.965
Barbara?

1:06:30.068 --> 1:06:30.931
Brittney?

1:06:31.965 --> 1:06:33.000
Bianca, Bianca.

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:34.000
- Bailey.

1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.172
- Bailey, B, I know it was a B.

1:06:36.172 --> 1:06:37.000
- With a B, yeah.

1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:37.965
- I knew it.

1:06:37.965 --> 1:06:39.724
- She's, she's doing just fine.

1:06:39.724 --> 1:06:41.551
She sends her regards.

1:06:43.034 --> 1:06:44.068
- Really?

1:06:44.068 --> 1:06:45.034
- [Chance] Yeah.

1:06:45.034 --> 1:06:46.068
- Tell her I said hi.

1:06:46.068 --> 1:06:46.931
- I will do.

1:06:46.931 --> 1:06:47.758
- [Terri] Good.

1:06:47.758 --> 1:06:49.000
- I will do.

1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.586
I cannot explain to
you how excited I am.

1:06:51.586 --> 1:06:52.413
- See.

1:06:53.586 --> 1:06:55.000
That right there.

1:06:55.931 --> 1:06:56.931
- Hmm?

1:06:56.931 --> 1:06:57.931
- That right there.

1:06:57.931 --> 1:06:59.000
No, no, this.

1:07:00.724 --> 1:07:01.931
Right there.

1:07:01.931 --> 1:07:05.034
That is why you're
perfect for the role.

1:07:05.034 --> 1:07:07.103
You're hungry and humble.

1:07:08.241 --> 1:07:10.310
That's what's missing
in this business.

1:07:10.310 --> 1:07:12.551
Now nobody, everybody's
a fucking asshole.

1:07:12.551 --> 1:07:15.724
And this is gonna be a
grueling, grueling shoot.

1:07:15.724 --> 1:07:16.724
It is.

1:07:16.724 --> 1:07:17.827
So I need team players.

1:07:17.827 --> 1:07:19.000
I need you to be focused.

1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.172
- I am [speaking foreign
language] focused.

1:07:21.172 --> 1:07:22.862
- You're skin a cat.

1:07:24.206 --> 1:07:27.586
- No, no, no, no, I'm
[speaking foreign language].

1:07:27.586 --> 1:07:29.103
- Skittles, Skittles, Skittles.

1:07:29.103 --> 1:07:31.482
- [speaking foreign
language] [clicking]

1:07:31.482 --> 1:07:33.655
- Skillet [clicking].

1:07:33.655 --> 1:07:34.793
- I mean you'll get
it, you'll get it.

1:07:34.793 --> 1:07:36.172
[speaking foreign language]

1:07:36.172 --> 1:07:37.172
- Don't fuck with me.

1:07:37.172 --> 1:07:38.379
- No, no, no, never.

1:07:38.379 --> 1:07:40.172
- I mean we got
great storytelling,

1:07:40.172 --> 1:07:42.103
I mean great performance.

1:07:42.103 --> 1:07:43.517
Poof.

1:07:43.517 --> 1:07:45.379
So that's it.

1:07:45.379 --> 1:07:46.413
- [Chance] Okay.

1:07:46.413 --> 1:07:47.379
- I'll see you on set.

1:07:47.379 --> 1:07:48.413
You can pick up your script

1:07:48.413 --> 1:07:49.620
from my secretary out front.

1:07:49.620 --> 1:07:51.241
- Thank you so,
so, I just want to.

1:07:51.241 --> 1:07:52.241
- Mm-mm.

1:07:52.241 --> 1:07:53.241
- [Chance] I just can't.

1:07:53.241 --> 1:07:54.275
- You can go get your script.

1:07:54.275 --> 1:07:55.310
- I can't kiss you on-

1:07:55.310 --> 1:07:56.310
- No.

1:07:56.310 --> 1:07:57.517
- No.

1:07:57.517 --> 1:07:58.758
I'm, I'm just,
I'm just gonna go.

1:07:58.758 --> 1:08:00.068
- Yes, just go.

1:08:05.137 --> 1:08:06.379
- Oh, yeah.

1:08:06.379 --> 1:08:07.517
Miss Vaughn said I
could get my script

1:08:07.517 --> 1:08:08.586
and schedule from you.

1:08:08.586 --> 1:08:10.724
- Here you are Mr. Crawford.

1:08:10.724 --> 1:08:12.620
- Thank you very much.

1:08:12.620 --> 1:08:13.620
That's me.

1:08:13.620 --> 1:08:14.689
Chance Crawford.

1:08:14.689 --> 1:08:16.344
- That's you.

1:08:16.344 --> 1:08:18.586
[laughing]

1:08:19.965 --> 1:08:21.793
- No, no, no, no, you
coming, send the card okay.

1:08:21.793 --> 1:08:25.275
I have clients on NBC,
ABC, CBS, so I know

1:08:27.241 --> 1:08:29.103
there's money in
the budget, okay.

1:08:29.103 --> 1:08:32.103
125,000 an episode,
minimum seven episodes.

1:08:32.103 --> 1:08:33.413
Yeah.

1:08:33.413 --> 1:08:36.000
And I will come to
set if I have to.

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:36.862
Bye.

1:08:42.344 --> 1:08:43.758
- Oh, my God, that's
Frank Moreland.

1:08:43.758 --> 1:08:44.758
Frankie.

1:08:44.758 --> 1:08:45.586
Frank!

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:50.689
Oh, my goodness, oh.

1:08:54.206 --> 1:08:55.551
Oh, my goodness.

1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:57.862
Frank?

1:09:04.206 --> 1:09:06.034
Aren't you Frank Moreland?

1:09:06.034 --> 1:09:07.517
- Yes, and you are?

1:09:07.517 --> 1:09:09.000
- I'm Chance Crawford.

1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.068
You are one of the biggest
agents in the business.

1:09:13.068 --> 1:09:15.310
Oh, because I've read up on you,

1:09:15.310 --> 1:09:16.379
I've searched you.

1:09:16.379 --> 1:09:18.068
I'm an actor.

1:09:18.068 --> 1:09:19.413
- I'm sure you are.

1:09:19.413 --> 1:09:20.862
- And I've been looking
for representation.

1:09:20.862 --> 1:09:22.275
- I'm sure you have.

1:09:22.275 --> 1:09:24.862
- But you know I've been
moving up really, really slow.

1:09:24.862 --> 1:09:26.793
You know, I've been
doing some short films,

1:09:26.793 --> 1:09:28.793
a few commercials, TV series,
but the biggest thing,

1:09:28.793 --> 1:09:32.448
Mr. Moreland is that I've
just booked the lead role

1:09:32.448 --> 1:09:34.724
in Terri Vaughn's new film.

1:09:35.827 --> 1:09:37.862
- Terri Vaughn?

1:09:37.862 --> 1:09:39.724
Actress turned award winning

1:09:39.724 --> 1:09:42.379
director producer Terri Vaughn.

1:09:42.379 --> 1:09:44.206
- We just literally come
out of a meeting with her

1:09:44.206 --> 1:09:46.896
right now out of her office.

1:09:46.896 --> 1:09:48.413
- Frank Moreland.

1:09:48.413 --> 1:09:50.793
Agent to the stars.

1:09:50.793 --> 1:09:52.034
- Yeah.

1:09:52.034 --> 1:09:53.724
Yes, Chance Crawford.

1:09:53.724 --> 1:09:54.827
- Yeah, yeah.

- No, I don't know how it is.

1:19:36.241 --> 1:19:38.482
I know you had a 7:00 call time

1:19:39.758 --> 1:19:40.758
we're making a movie.

1:19:40.758 --> 1:19:41.965
- Just a second.

1:19:41.965 --> 1:19:43.655
Um, we need to probably
have a conversation

1:19:43.655 --> 1:19:46.758
about maybe having
a later call time.

1:19:49.068 --> 1:19:50.275

pick the call time.

1:20:07.724 --> 1:20:10.689
You know what maybe, maybe
you and I can discuss

1:20:10.689 --> 1:20:13.758
him having a later
call time, you know.

1:20:13.758 --> 1:20:15.103
Especially since
you've been working him

1:20:15.103 --> 1:20:17.000
consistently for 16 hours a day.

1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:18.931

Come on, stop playing.

1:21:01.862 --> 1:21:03.310
If it's not too much trouble.

1:21:03.310 --> 1:21:05.517

I've got a few suggestions
for a few of the scenes

1:21:16.310 --> 1:21:17.586
to make them work
a little bit better

1:21:17.586 --> 1:21:20.310
because they're
not, not gelling.

1:21:21.448 --> 1:21:22.517
- Not gelling.

was like tweak it.

1:21:27.344 --> 1:21:28.689
- Tweak.

1:21:28.689 --> 1:21:29.689
- [Frank] Small.

1:21:29.689 --> 1:21:30.689
- Small, it's not a lot.

1:21:30.689 --> 1:21:31.896
- Okay.

1:21:31.896 --> 1:21:35.103
Uh, why don't you go

1:23:21.448 --> 1:23:22.965
Didn't I specifically
say that my character

1:23:22.965 --> 1:23:24.379
would only wear black shoelaces

1:23:24.379 --> 1:23:25.896
because he's very militant.

1:23:25.896 --> 1:23:26.896
Didn't I say that?

1:23:26.896 --> 1:23:27.896
- Yes, sir.

1:23:27.896 --> 1:23:29.103
- Yes, I did.

1:23:29.103 --> 1:23:29.931
So what color are
these shoelaces?

1:23:29.931 --> 1:23:30.931
- Uh, they're white.

1:23:30.931 --> 1:23:31.758
- Which means they're not?

1:23:31.758 --> 1:23:32.758
- Black.

1:23:32.758 --> 1:23:33.448
- [Chance] Which
means we have a?

1:23:33.448 --> 1:23:34.448
- Problem.

1:23:34.448 --> 1:23:35.448
- A problem.

1:23:35.448 --> 1:23:36.862
So?

1:23:36.862 --> 1:23:38.000
- I'll go, I'll go
check, uh, to see if they

1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:39.241
have some black
shoelaces in wardrobe.

1:23:39.241 --> 1:23:39.793
- [Chance] Hey,
what's your name?

1:23:39.793 --> 1:23:40.586
- John.

- So, uh, you want to
tell us what happened?

1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:47.689
- I'll tell you what happened.

1:23:47.689 --> 1:23:50.310
You see right there
was blatant disrespect

1:23:50.310 --> 1:23:51.931
because I specifically told them

1:23:51.931 --> 1:23:53.517
my character would only
wear black shoelaces

1:23:53.517 --> 1:23:55.000
because he's very militant.

1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:56.586
Now look around you,
look around you.

1:23:56.586 --> 1:23:59.586
I am the only one
with a red trailer.

1:23:59.586 --> 1:24:00.689
Do you know why that is?

1:24:00.689 --> 1:24:02.206
Because I'm Chance Crawford.

1:24:06.551 --> 1:24:08.344
Now all I'm asking
for is what I deserve.

1:24:08.344 --> 1:24:11.103
I deserve the best, now please.

1:24:11.103 --> 1:24:13.000

- Ms. Vaughn, we have a problem.

1:24:18.862 --> 1:24:20.310
- Yes, we do because
where's Chance.

1:24:20.310 --> 1:24:21.793
- He won't come
out of his trailer.

1:24:21.793 --> 1:24:23.965
- What do you mean he won't
come out of his trailer?

1:24:23.965 --> 1:24:25.000
That's why you walked over there

1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:26.827
so he could walk back with you.

1:24:26.827 --> 1:24:28.551
- He won't wear the shoes.

1:24:28.551 --> 1:24:31.344
- Why won't he wear the shoes?

1:24:31.344 --> 1:24:33.689
- Because they have

1:25:16.551 --> 1:25:18.103

And in it it states
that the main actor

1:25:36.448 --> 1:25:39.344
can be replaced at the
director's discretion

1:25:39.344 --> 1:25:41.862

1:25:41.862 --> 1:25:46.655

schedule and he has.

look into that contract.

any actor in here.

an actor like Chance.

all just calm down

1:26:18.793 --> 1:26:21.241

what's going on.

You gotta get her out
of that dressing room.

1:33:00.068 --> 1:33:01.310
- How am I supposed to do that.

1:33:01.310 --> 1:33:02.448
- I don't give a damn
how many times you

1:33:02.448 --> 1:33:03.448
tweak the lights.

1:33:03.448 --> 1:33:05.241
I'm trying to get a shot here.

1:33:05.241 --> 1:33:07.137
You understand?

1:33:07.137 --> 1:33:08.172
- Fine.

1:33:08.172 --> 1:33:09.689
- No, it's not fine.

1:33:09.689 --> 1:33:10.862
- I cannot get her out of
her damn dressing room.

1:33:10.862 --> 1:33:12.068
- Really.

1:33:12.068 --> 1:33:14.310
Show me where her
fucking room is.

1:33:14.310 --> 1:33:16.793
- Right this way sir.

1:33:16.793 --> 1:33:17.793
[knocking]

1:33:17.793 --> 1:33:18.793
Hello.

1:33:18.793 --> 1:33:19.827
Miss Kingston.

1:33:19.827 --> 1:33:21.586
You are so late coming to set.

1:33:21.586 --> 1:33:23.241
Will you please open the door.

1:33:23.241 --> 1:33:25.586
This is very unprofessional.

1:33:27.103 --> 1:33:29.931
[knocking]

1:33:29.931 --> 1:33:32.000
Open the fucking door.

1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:34.793
[dramatic music]

1:33:36.103 --> 1:33:37.103
- Where do you
think you're going.

1:33:37.103 --> 1:33:38.103
This is a closed set.

1:33:38.103 --> 1:33:39.103
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1:33:39.103 --> 1:33:40.310
I'm looking for Bailey Kingston.

1:33:40.310 --> 1:33:41.310
- You know what?

1:33:41.310 --> 1:33:42.310
I want her replaced, let's go.

1:33:42.310 --> 1:33:43.482
- Here she is.

1:33:44.827 --> 1:33:45.827
He says he knows Baily.

1:33:45.827 --> 1:33:47.275
- Yes, do you know where she is?

1:33:47.275 --> 1:33:50.379
- Yeah, maybe you can help me.

1:33:50.379 --> 1:33:52.241
- I'm alone, Ma.

1:33:52.241 --> 1:33:53.241
- You are not alone.

1:33:53.241 --> 1:33:55.275
I'm right here with you.

1:33:55.275 --> 1:33:58.241
- I quit, I'm gonna
pack up and leave.

1:33:58.241 --> 1:34:01.517
- Bailey, Bailey,
it's me, it's Chance.

1:34:03.137 --> 1:34:04.000
Bailey.

1:34:06.931 --> 1:34:09.275
Bailey, please, I know I
said some stupid stuff,

1:34:09.275 --> 1:34:11.103
I'm really, really sorry.

1:34:11.103 --> 1:34:13.000
Bailey please, don't do this.

1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:14.275
- Go away.

1:34:14.275 --> 1:34:16.068
- Bailey I'm not going anywhere.

1:34:16.068 --> 1:34:17.965
Please open the
door so we can talk.

1:34:17.965 --> 1:34:19.724
- What do you want?

1:34:19.724 --> 1:34:21.896
- Look, I'm never, ever
going anywhere again.

1:34:21.896 --> 1:34:23.275
I'm so, so sorry.

1:34:24.482 --> 1:34:26.000
Okay, let me just
make things right.

1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:27.655
Just open up the door.

1:34:27.655 --> 1:34:31.517
- Please, please
just go away Chance.

1:34:31.517 --> 1:34:32.586
- [Chance] Bailey,
I'm not going.

1:34:32.586 --> 1:34:34.379
- I said go away.

1:34:34.379 --> 1:34:35.896
- [Mother] Bailey.

1:34:39.896 --> 1:34:40.724
Bailey.

1:34:41.827 --> 1:34:44.068
Now listen to me.

1:34:44.068 --> 1:34:47.344
This is what you trained
for, worked hard for.

1:34:47.344 --> 1:34:49.103
Now I need you to
pull yourself together

1:34:49.103 --> 1:34:53.448
and go out there and step
into your light and shine.

1:34:55.620 --> 1:34:56.448
- Okay.

1:34:57.793 --> 1:34:58.620
Okay.

1:35:00.413 --> 1:35:01.655
Okay, I'll try.

1:35:03.413 --> 1:35:05.241
I'll call you back Ma.

1:35:07.206 --> 1:35:08.206
- Bailey, Bailey.

1:35:08.206 --> 1:35:09.206
- What do you want?

1:35:09.206 --> 1:35:10.206
- Look, I've been calling you.

1:35:10.206 --> 1:35:11.655
- I know.

1:35:11.655 --> 1:35:12.586
- All right, look, I
just need to speak to you

1:35:12.586 --> 1:35:13.413
for a second, okay, please.

1:35:13.413 --> 1:35:14.965
- About what?

1:35:14.965 --> 1:35:16.965
- I know you're probably
not happy with me,

1:35:16.965 --> 1:35:18.551
but I just wanted to see you.

1:35:18.551 --> 1:35:19.758
- See me for what.

1:35:19.758 --> 1:35:21.482
Because according to
you I can't act, right.

1:35:21.482 --> 1:35:22.758
I should just go
back to South Africa

1:35:22.758 --> 1:35:23.931
and stop wasting
my parents' money.

1:35:23.931 --> 1:35:24.931
- I didn't mean it.

1:35:24.931 --> 1:35:25.758
- Move!

1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:28.000
- [Chance] Bailey!

1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:29.000
- I'm here.

1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:30.000
- Bailey look, hold on.

1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:31.000
I didn't mean it
like that, okay.

1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:32.896
Just Bailey, hold on.

1:35:32.896 --> 1:35:35.137
- Charles, what's going on?

1:35:36.034 --> 1:35:37.413
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1:35:37.413 --> 1:35:38.413
- What are you scared of.

1:35:38.413 --> 1:35:39.413
- Hold on a second.

1:35:39.413 --> 1:35:40.413
- I just want to-

1:35:40.413 --> 1:35:41.689
- You know this guy?

1:35:41.689 --> 1:35:42.482
- I just want five
minutes with you.

1:35:42.482 --> 1:35:43.689
- Okay, okay, hold on.

1:35:43.689 --> 1:35:45.310
I'm the director here,
I'm going a movie.

1:35:45.310 --> 1:35:46.827
- All right, I just want
to speak to Bailey, man.

1:35:46.827 --> 1:35:47.827
- Hold on.

1:35:47.827 --> 1:35:48.827
We're doing a movie.

1:35:48.827 --> 1:35:49.931
- Hold on, hold on, hold on now.

1:35:49.931 --> 1:35:50.931
Bailey.

1:35:50.931 --> 1:35:51.931
- Wait, yo man.

1:35:51.931 --> 1:35:52.931
- Hold on.

1:35:52.931 --> 1:35:53.862
- I'm doing a fucking movie.

1:35:53.862 --> 1:35:54.655
This is my fucking movie set.

1:35:54.655 --> 1:35:55.586
- Don't touch me.

1:35:55.586 --> 1:35:57.896
- You can't just walk on my set.

1:35:57.896 --> 1:35:59.103
- I came to speak to Bailey

1:35:59.103 --> 1:36:00.413
and I'm not leaving
until I do, okay.

1:36:00.413 --> 1:36:02.206
If that means I have
to knock you down

1:36:02.206 --> 1:36:04.517
to get to her, I will.

1:36:04.517 --> 1:36:05.689
- No, you're not
gonna knock me down.

1:36:05.689 --> 1:36:06.862
Get off my set.

1:36:06.862 --> 1:36:08.034
Get off my set.

1:36:08.034 --> 1:36:09.034
Don't you-

1:36:09.034 --> 1:36:10.034
- Hold on, hold on.

1:36:10.034 --> 1:36:11.034
- Let me go.

1:36:11.034 --> 1:36:12.034
- Hold on.

1:36:12.034 --> 1:36:13.034
- I love her.

1:36:13.034 --> 1:36:14.275
Okay.

1:36:14.275 --> 1:36:15.586
All I'm asking for
is five minutes

1:36:15.586 --> 1:36:18.000
and then I'll leave your set.

1:36:20.724 --> 1:36:22.034
- What's your deal, bro?

1:36:22.034 --> 1:36:23.103
- I love her.

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:27.000
- All right.

1:36:28.655 --> 1:36:31.517
I'll give you five minutes.

1:36:31.517 --> 1:36:33.586
You better make it count.

1:36:37.586 --> 1:36:38.586
- Thank you.

1:36:42.137 --> 1:36:43.000
Bailey.

1:36:46.482 --> 1:36:48.482
What are you scared for?

1:36:48.482 --> 1:36:50.000
Huh?

1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.206
This isn't what, this is
what we wanted, isn't it?

1:36:54.206 --> 1:36:55.137
This is it.

1:36:57.068 --> 1:36:58.620
Now I messed up.

1:36:58.620 --> 1:36:59.965
I messed up everything,
Bailey I messed up

1:36:59.965 --> 1:37:02.068
and got fired from
the Terri Vaughn set.

1:37:02.068 --> 1:37:05.586
And most importantly
I messed up with you.

1:37:08.068 --> 1:37:10.068
You deserve all of this.

1:37:10.965 --> 1:37:12.517
I believe in you.

1:37:12.517 --> 1:37:14.482
Don't mess up this opportunity

1:37:14.482 --> 1:37:16.586
the way I did mine, okay.

1:37:19.896 --> 1:37:21.068
Baby, this industry
got to my head

1:37:21.068 --> 1:37:24.000
and it turned me
into a selfish jerk

1:37:26.448 --> 1:37:30.655
and I said some things
that I shouldn't have and

1:37:30.655 --> 1:37:32.827
I am deeply, deeply sorry.

1:37:35.793 --> 1:37:37.275
I love you Bailey.

1:37:38.655 --> 1:37:42.896
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

1:37:42.896 --> 1:37:45.275
I can't believe I found my
South African soul mate,

1:37:45.275 --> 1:37:49.344
the love of my life, all
the way here in America.

1:37:50.689 --> 1:37:53.793
Lord knows I don't
deserve your forgiveness,

1:37:53.793 --> 1:37:56.206
but hell, I'm begging for it.

1:38:02.068 --> 1:38:05.137
I wasn't sure how or
when I would do this.

1:38:05.137 --> 1:38:07.551
- What are you talking about?

1:38:10.758 --> 1:38:12.344
- I'm talking about

1:38:13.896 --> 1:38:16.103
being with you for
the rest of my life.

1:38:16.103 --> 1:38:16.965
- Wow.

1:38:20.413 --> 1:38:21.758
Bailey Kingston.

1:38:23.965 --> 1:38:25.448
Will you marry me?

1:38:28.448 --> 1:38:30.551
- I'm not sure that
we'll be working actors

1:38:30.551 --> 1:38:32.000
in the industry
every again because

1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.310
we're gonna get blacklisted.

1:38:38.655 --> 1:38:41.586
- [Director] I like it though.

1:38:41.586 --> 1:38:43.000
- I'll marry you.

1:38:44.827 --> 1:38:45.655
- Yeah.

1:38:46.517 --> 1:38:47.344
Yes!

1:38:49.413 --> 1:38:52.827
- [Director] Did you
set this up Charles.

1:38:54.344 --> 1:38:55.620
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:38:55.620 --> 1:38:56.724
Is this real?

1:38:58.413 --> 1:38:59.344
- Yes, sir.

1:39:00.620 --> 1:39:01.793
- You just proposed to her.

1:39:01.793 --> 1:39:03.000
- Yes.

1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:04.689
- You set this up,
is this like a prank

1:39:04.689 --> 1:39:07.413
thing or something,
is this real?

1:39:09.620 --> 1:39:10.448
Wow.

1:39:11.310 --> 1:39:12.310
I'm touched.

1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:15.620
I'm really touched.

1:39:17.586 --> 1:39:19.000
So you're an actor.

1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:21.551
- Actually yes, yes, sir, I am.

1:39:25.034 --> 1:39:25.896
- Wow.

1:39:26.862 --> 1:39:27.896
Wow, you know what?

1:39:27.896 --> 1:39:30.517
We're gonna script this.

1:39:30.517 --> 1:39:31.620
This is epic.

1:39:32.896 --> 1:39:34.344
I mean it was real,
it was organic.

1:39:34.344 --> 1:39:38.344
It's gotta be real to
suck me in, I'll tell you.

1:39:39.448 --> 1:39:40.275
Ah, man.

1:39:41.724 --> 1:39:42.793
Do me a favor, Charles.

1:39:42.793 --> 1:39:45.482
Walk this guy out here.

1:39:45.482 --> 1:39:47.344
If he has any
paperwork to be signed,

1:39:47.344 --> 1:39:50.379
let him sign it,
give him his check.

1:39:50.379 --> 1:39:51.379
- I just started.

1:39:51.379 --> 1:39:53.551
- You just finished.

1:39:53.551 --> 1:39:54.793
- Congratulations.

1:39:54.793 --> 1:39:56.896
You're my new lead actor.

1:39:58.103 --> 1:39:59.103
- Oh, my goodness.

1:39:59.103 --> 1:40:00.275
Oh, my goodness, thank you.

1:40:00.275 --> 1:40:01.275
Thank you.

1:40:01.275 --> 1:40:02.793
Thank you so much.

1:40:03.931 --> 1:40:05.724
- You almost got
our ass beat though.

1:40:05.724 --> 1:40:06.896
It's all good.

1:40:08.655 --> 1:40:10.931
Listen to me young lady.

1:40:10.931 --> 1:40:13.310
Love is special, you hear me?

1:40:14.241 --> 1:40:17.103
Now me and my producers saw you

1:40:17.103 --> 1:40:21.448
and we hired you because
you have something special.

1:40:22.965 --> 1:40:25.517
Keep your heart
in the right place

1:40:25.517 --> 1:40:28.724
and know that it's
a gift from God.

1:40:28.724 --> 1:40:29.724
Do the work.

1:40:30.586 --> 1:40:31.586
Okay.

1:40:31.586 --> 1:40:32.931
Scripty, let's go get this down,

1:40:32.931 --> 1:40:34.551
this is incredible.

1:40:34.551 --> 1:40:35.689
Let's go.

1:40:35.689 --> 1:40:37.103
I'm gonna deal with you, okay.

1:40:37.103 --> 1:40:38.965
I might, I might like you.

1:40:38.965 --> 1:40:42.448
