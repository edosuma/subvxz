Last time
 on "Fresh Off the Boat"...

00:04.238 --> 00:05.639
-I go to St. Orlando's Prep.
-Private school.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.175
Can I please go to St. Orlando's
next year, Mommy?

00:07.208 --> 00:09.310
Michael Bolton offered me
a partnership deal

00:09.343 --> 00:11.679
for the restaurant,
and I think we should take it.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.715
I want to own our house, and
this deal will let us do that.

00:14.748 --> 00:18.219
You're right, but we're
not buying this house.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.587
You wanna buy
 this house?

00:19.620 --> 00:21.355
With one stipulation.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.391
You get our son
into St. Orlando's.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.594
-What's going on?
-We're moving.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.601

all your stuff away?

00:33.634 --> 00:35.503
Nah, man.
This is my luggage.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.004
We're only moving
across town.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.506
It's crazy
that you're gonna be going

00:38.539 --> 00:39.907
to a different high school
next year.

00:39.940 --> 00:40.841
It's no big deal.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.009
We'll still hang out
all the time.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.511
Me and Alison are
all good.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.446
Plus, we got
the whole summer to chill.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.248
The new house
has a hot tub.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.049
It'll be just like
MTV's Beach House.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.018
But with no
Bill Bellamy.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.553
Now you feel me.

00:52.586 --> 00:53.921
Why are you guys
moving, anyway?

00:53.954 --> 00:56.490
So someone can go
to private school.

I can't wait to introduce you
to my khakis.

01:01.229 --> 01:02.696
We'll have to
divide these

01:02.730 --> 01:04.532

our own rooms.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.866
How 'bout you take
the herbivores

01:05.899 --> 01:07.067
and I'll take
the carnivores?

01:07.101 --> 01:09.903
Or we divide them
by geologic time period.

of our security deposit.

to reminisce.

off of work for this move,

packing your pants.

my white Wranglers

myself a Taiwanese Weezy.

to leave this place.

03:29.943 --> 03:33.281
Exactly, because poverty
moves in silence.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.575
edgy but not trashy.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.711
No, bicep all day.
That way when we flex,

09:03.744 --> 09:05.512
our slices can dance
to the music.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.847
I say we go neck.

-No way!

Well, what can I do
for you?

that the school blazers

Hmm.
I'm a little confused.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.802
I thought you wanted to be
a silent partner.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.971
I did, until I thought
about Kenny Rogers

would've been too small for one,

No, that doesn't change
anything.

It was a huge check.

to get out of my pocket

I had a gun.

myself.

-In the fire.

to buy this house,

to enjoy it.

with comfortable?

with that exact slogan.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.486
If we get too comfortable,

13:06.519 --> 13:08.355
then we'll be satisfied
with what we have.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.323
And then we won't keep
pushing to be better.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.258

have to push?

is what got us here.

It was.
I'm sorry.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.347
I know that's the whole reason
we moved here.

18:02.949 --> 18:06.219
Well, if that school doesn't
want you, they're idiots.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.987
So, you're not mad?

18:08.020 --> 18:10.056
We'll make
our own private school.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.926
And you'll do better than any
of those St. Orlando's kids.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.763
We'll up your C.L.C.,
hire you a private tutor,

18:16.796 --> 18:19.432
have Grandma
make you a blazer.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.601
We're gonna be okay.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.605
Group hug!
Everything turned out fine!

18:25.638 --> 18:26.906
Nobody's angry
at anybody!

18:26.939 --> 18:28.508
Don't even, Wisconsin.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.646
[ Sighs ] You know
what this means?

18:33.680 --> 18:35.482
Now we can go home.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.350
What?

18:37.384 --> 18:39.286
You wanna go back
to our old house?

18:39.319 --> 18:40.487
I miss it.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.522
I miss Honey
and the old neighborhood.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.591
It was better there.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.926
I didn't have to try
to enjoy it.

18:46.959 --> 18:47.794
I just did.

18:47.827 --> 18:51.298
This house isn't us.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.267
I miss it, too.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.368
But we can't go back.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.204
We already made
the down payment.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.305
We're stuck here.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.639
Are we?

18:59.672 --> 19:04.444
Or did you forget that you're
married to a real-estate pimp?

19:04.477 --> 19:07.380
You want to return
the house?

19:07.414 --> 19:10.550
[ Laughs ] Sorry,
we already closed the deal.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.884
Well, that's true,

19:11.918 --> 19:14.787
but you never disclosed
that this house is haunted.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.956
My family hears voices
in the walls.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.325
Um...

19:18.358 --> 19:20.159
Houses perceived
to be haunted

19:20.193 --> 19:21.961
constitute
a "phenomena stigma."

19:21.994 --> 19:23.863
Failing to disclose
a stigmatized property

19:23.896 --> 19:25.332
allows me
to rescind the sale.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.666
It's a thing.
Look it up.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.536
[ Sighs ]

19:29.569 --> 19:31.070
I hate real estate.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.639
We'll be out by Friday.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.140
[ Chuckles ]

19:34.173 --> 19:35.808
Attention, everyone.
Pack your bags.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.210
We're moving on back.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.511
[ Sighs ]

19:50.457 --> 19:52.825
Feels good to be back
in the old neighborhood.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.161
Close to work, where I can
keep an eye on Bolton.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.063
He wants to put a veggie burger
on the menu.

19:57.096 --> 19:59.599
Only one Bolton story a day,
remember?

19:59.632 --> 20:00.833
Sorry.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.835
Evan, you need to talk to me
at some point.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.437
We're gonna be
sharing a room again.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.738
I'll talk to you.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.408
About how you're gonna get me
back into St. Orlando's.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.043
Because I am going
to that school!

20:19.218 --> 20:22.021
I'm going to the same
high school as my friends,

20:22.054 --> 20:24.190
and they're not
my friends anymore.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.592
I messed up.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.142
All right, everybody.
We're home!

20:43.175 --> 20:46.613
See, boys? This is why
you never throw out a key.

20:46.646 --> 20:47.814
[ Keys jingling ]

20:54.253 --> 20:56.756
[ Sighs ]

21:00.360 --> 21:02.228
Who are you?

21:02.261 --> 21:03.296
Well, I'm Adam.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.298
My family and I
just rented this house.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.399
What?

21:06.433 --> 21:08.134
Who are you?

21:08.167 --> 21:10.403
Oh, wait.
Did you see our flyer?

21:10.437 --> 21:11.738
Did you find our cat?

21:11.771 --> 21:14.507
Kids, get in here!
They found Mr. S'mores!

21:14.541 --> 21:15.608
Jessica: Oh, my God.

21:15.642 --> 21:18.778
My worst nightmare
has come true.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.214
We're homeless.

21:24.984 --> 21:25.952
Uh, okay.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.186
Well,
if you're gonna stay,

21:27.219 --> 21:28.555
can you take
your shoes off?
