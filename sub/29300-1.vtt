00:15.968 --> 00:18.904
[Yorozuya]
Man, we really did it!

00:18.904 --> 00:21.774
The first Gintama movie
was such a big hit

00:21.774 --> 00:24.010
that we are making a second one
to ride that money train!

00:24.010 --> 00:26.779
Last year, it was Japan's #1 
live-action movie of the year.

00:26.779 --> 00:29.849
But we didn't win  
the Japanese Academy Awards-aru.

00:29.849 --> 00:32.752
Who was it? Who was the guy
that won the "Best Actor" award?

00:32.752 --> 00:35.721
- A guy named Suda Masaki-aru.
- Eh? Why?

00:35.721 --> 00:38.224
His fashion sense is top notch
and he's a delicate guy.

00:38.224 --> 00:41.260
He's also an artist with a CD debut
and the whole bit, huh?

00:41.260 --> 00:43.229
The old man has a funny pair of glasses...

00:43.229 --> 00:44.830
Don't say anymore!

00:44.830 --> 00:47.199
That Suda Masaki is a very good actor, right?

00:47.199 --> 00:49.394
Have you ever thought about
Oguri Shun's acting?

00:49.802 --> 00:52.938
He's done so much...

00:52.938 --> 00:56.042
But he has never won an academy award
once in his life...

00:56.042 --> 00:58.444
He worked so hard last year too...

00:58.444 --> 01:00.246
with his movie "I Want to Eat
the Liver of a Cattle."

01:00.246 --> 01:01.714
It's "Your Pancreas."
(real title of movie: Let Me Eat Your Pancreas)

01:01.714 --> 01:04.500
"I Want to Eat Cow Pancreas" would change
the movie on a whole other level.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.686
It would turn into some sad
documentary after all.

01:06.686 --> 01:09.422
It's fine! Even if we didn't win
the Japanese Academy Award,

01:09.422 --> 01:12.992
we had many viewers and received
great box office results!

01:12.992 --> 01:14.118
That's true.

01:14.293 --> 01:19.265
The Japanese Academy Award
can go **** itself in the ***.

01:19.265 --> 01:23.929
We don't need to win that *******
piece of **** award anyways.

01:23.929 --> 01:25.700
Yeah... Yeah...

01:25.700 --> 01:27.973
Uh... I understand you're frustrated,

01:27.973 --> 01:29.975
but what you just said
were too obscene.

01:29.975 --> 01:32.078
I don't think anyone understood you
due to all the bleeping.

01:32.078 --> 01:33.779
But that's not important!

01:33.779 --> 01:35.815
This movie is about to start.

01:35.815 --> 01:38.417
Say, "Please watch it," 
or some other love-filled phrase!

01:38.417 --> 01:39.485
Okay!

01:39.485 --> 01:42.221
This Gintama has won the "Cannes Palm Doll" Award.
(The director of "The Shoplifting Family" won this award)

01:42.221 --> 01:43.489
You liar!

01:43.489 --> 01:46.358
- We shoplifted.
- Don't do that!

01:46.358 --> 01:49.195
Now then, let us begin
the "Shoplifting Yorozuya" movie.

01:49.195 --> 01:50.896
That's not the title!

01:50.896 --> 01:53.165
Then, how about "The Famous Detective Yorozuya!"

01:53.165 --> 01:55.034
"There's always one truth!"
(Parody of Detective Conan)

01:55.034 --> 01:58.299
Like I said, stop spoofing
other blockbuster movies!

01:58.804 --> 02:01.273
Gintama 2: Rules are Meant to be Broken!

02:01.273 --> 02:02.374
Please enjoy!

02:02.374 --> 02:03.807
Give us an academy award!

02:19.925 --> 02:23.162
It's a crime to film this movie
in the theaters.

02:23.162 --> 02:26.928
Please watch it with your eyes 
and take it home with your heart.

02:27.166 --> 02:31.303
[Stop fussing.]
Hey! They want to see the actual movie already!

02:31.303 --> 02:33.100
[Stop fussing.]
Hurry up and start the movie!

02:52.358 --> 02:54.019
"The Land of Samurai."

02:54.360 --> 02:58.524
The reason why I was sent to 
this country is an old story.

02:59.532 --> 03:03.035
20 years ago,
in this peaceful Edo City,

03:03.035 --> 03:05.560
aliens from space flew down 
into the city and attacked.

03:06.405 --> 03:09.169
We call them the Amanto.

03:09.909 --> 03:12.571
The Amanto kept coming one after the other.

03:13.445 --> 03:16.582
Even the Shogunate succumbed to them.
They became the puppet masters.

03:16.582 --> 03:19.915
As a result, in order to eliminate 
the Amanto, the Joui War broke out.

03:20.553 --> 03:23.579
At that time, many brave men 
of lofty ideals came forward to fight.

03:23.989 --> 03:26.583
But the casualties were heavy
and they were defeated.

03:27.526 --> 03:30.996
Then, the Amanto,
in fear of revolt from the humans,

03:30.996 --> 03:32.865
prohibited the usage of swords,

03:32.865 --> 03:35.459
causing the Samurai to decline.

03:36.602 --> 03:39.371
That's it!
That's all you need to know!

03:39.371 --> 03:43.209
If you don't have any money, you can sell your kidneys, 
your balls or whatever! Get me my money, you rooster!

03:43.209 --> 03:47.980
[Otose: The owner of Otose Snack House.
One of the four devas of the Kabuki district.]

03:47.980 --> 03:50.482
You're so fussy about the rent,
you shitty old hag!

03:50.482 --> 03:51.984
The other day, I told you about the games
that I wanted to play on my phone!

03:51.984 --> 03:54.353
And then you installed them, right?
Doesn't that make us even?

03:54.353 --> 03:56.355
That doesn't make us even!

03:56.355 --> 03:59.558
And besides, you spent all your money on that game
and that's why you are broke right now!

03:59.558 --> 04:01.427
I know that!

04:01.427 --> 04:04.453
An old hag like you shouldn't
know about in-game purchases!

04:05.164 --> 04:09.601
No! Everyone, look!
He's abusing an old lady!

04:22.915 --> 04:25.315
It's all over.
Everything.

04:26.352 --> 04:28.387
Like hell it is!

04:28.387 --> 04:30.200
Pay your rent!

04:35.527 --> 04:38.189
I'm going to die!

04:39.064 --> 04:44.060
For crying out loud... She's been bugging me
about the rent for three months straight now.

04:44.069 --> 04:45.434
Let's get a real job.

04:46.472 --> 04:48.565
How many times do I have to 
tell you before you get it?

04:49.408 --> 04:52.244
It's hard to find a decent job these days.

04:52.244 --> 04:54.313
The jobs are different every time.

04:54.313 --> 04:57.983
It's much worse to wait passively for people to come 
to the door than to take the initiative to make money.

04:57.983 --> 05:01.186
You haven't had a job request
for an entire month.

05:01.186 --> 05:02.551
Hey, Shinpachi!

05:03.355 --> 05:05.687
Don't you have any pride as a man?

05:06.625 --> 05:10.496
We only do what people come to ask for.

05:10.496 --> 05:13.098
Isn't that the soul of Yorozuya?

05:13.098 --> 05:14.500
That's true, but...

05:14.500 --> 05:17.603
In short, a hungry stomach can not think.

05:17.603 --> 05:19.505
Let's eat first
and then think of a plan.

05:19.505 --> 05:22.341
Man, it was delicious, so delicious!

05:22.341 --> 05:24.643
The smell of roasted saury
being cooked outside...

05:24.643 --> 05:26.634
I carelessly started eating
the rice before it was done-aru.

05:33.452 --> 05:34.942
You...

05:36.288 --> 05:38.085
ate it all?

05:54.740 --> 05:57.209
Just because of the smell,
you ate five cups of rice?

05:57.209 --> 06:00.076
I'll cook it again! I'll cook
something up right now-aru!

06:07.052 --> 06:09.588
There's nothing left.
Everything has been eaten.

06:09.588 --> 06:10.748
It was you!

06:11.323 --> 06:13.292
Work! We have to find work, Gin-san!

06:13.292 --> 06:16.125
I don't want to!

06:17.129 --> 06:21.667
I understand. Since yesterday, I found
some minions who can work for us-aru.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.532
Minions? You have minions, Kagura-chan?

06:24.003 --> 06:27.666
Hey! You guys!
Get to working!

06:33.245 --> 06:36.115
[Work Work]

06:36.115 --> 06:37.683
[Urgent: Need lovely girls ASAP]

06:37.683 --> 06:39.251
[Happy chatting and free drinks!]

06:39.251 --> 06:40.479
[Great wage!]

06:44.089 --> 06:45.557
Sorry about this, Gin-san.

06:45.557 --> 06:48.761
Shin-chan asked me if there were any 
job offerings, so I called you guys over.

06:48.761 --> 06:51.597
Sorry, Mr. Owner.
We are relying on you like siblings.

06:51.597 --> 06:54.500
Yeah, um... You know what? I'm sorry,
but saying things like that... 

06:54.500 --> 06:57.336
Saying things like, "I'm the one who's sorry..."
It's like you're sending those words back to them.

06:57.336 --> 07:01.774
In other words, how should I say this? 
Um... our store has an ace hostess.

07:01.774 --> 07:07.446
Well, Tae-chan... Uh... she always gets picked.
In other words, how do I say this, how do I say this?

07:07.446 --> 07:09.380
There's no mistaking it, 
is pretty much what it is.

07:10.049 --> 07:14.253
But your top hostess
should make men feel lovesick

07:14.253 --> 07:16.121
and it's almost like
they've caught a cold.

07:16.121 --> 07:18.123
This store is definitely a store full of pros.

07:18.123 --> 07:20.492
Yeah, um... I'm sorry. 
I'm really sorry about that.

07:20.492 --> 07:23.762
What to say? It's some kind of something, 
something, something, something,

07:23.762 --> 07:25.497
something, something, something...

07:25.497 --> 07:27.633
It's a very embarrassing concept.

07:27.633 --> 07:30.202
I can only say that it's 
a really embarrassing concept.

07:30.202 --> 07:34.606
Let's say that our top hostess is by herself...

07:34.606 --> 07:37.843
Let's just say that you decide to
open up a store, open up a store...

07:37.843 --> 07:39.278
That would be good, good, good! (kekkou: means good 
or carrying something out like opening a store)

07:39.278 --> 07:42.314
You have to make those kinds of decisions.
That's what I'm talking about.

07:42.314 --> 07:45.217
Wow, you're really something else!

07:45.217 --> 07:47.378
The rumor that an idiot
won't catch a cold is true.

07:49.822 --> 07:54.159
This angle is great.
The angle of the shot is very good.

07:54.159 --> 07:56.261
It's a super perfect angle.

07:56.261 --> 08:00.833
The blood is connecting
your nose to your mouth.

08:00.833 --> 08:03.669
Um... that proves that you are a dumbass.

08:03.669 --> 08:07.439
I had expected that, so...
In other words...

08:07.439 --> 08:11.000
In other words, Gin-san,
I want to request something from you.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.847
Simply put, Gin-san, you're some kind, some kind, 
some kind, some kind, some kind, some kind,

08:14.847 --> 08:17.449
some kind, some kind, some kind,
some kind of well known person.

08:17.449 --> 08:19.685
Can you introduce me to one or two 
cute girls? Or even ten?

08:19.685 --> 08:23.500
Or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or 50 girls!

08:23.500 --> 08:24.746
Or, or, or...

08:25.424 --> 08:28.257
Or! Or, or, or...

08:30.762 --> 08:35.234
Or 100 girls! 100 girls. 100 girls. 
Gin-san. 100 girls. 100 girls would be good.

08:35.234 --> 08:39.404
Can you bring 100 of your friends?
Maybe, 100 people isn't enough.

08:39.404 --> 08:43.775
So there you go. Well, we can all have fun afterwards.
I guess you should call them over right away.

08:43.775 --> 08:47.643
Um, in other words, in other words... I'm sure 
they will come super fast if you call them over.

08:47.913 --> 08:50.616
If they really do exist, 
then I want you to introduce them to me.

08:50.616 --> 08:52.751
If you're looking for a cute girl,
there's one right here-aru!

08:52.751 --> 08:56.255
Senior officials of the Shogunate
are coming over tonight.

08:56.255 --> 08:57.589
Hey, don't ignore me.

08:57.589 --> 08:59.458
These kinds of guests are very rare.

08:59.458 --> 09:00.492
- Their income is very good too. 
- Hey! 

09:00.492 --> 09:01.894
Hey, you fried noodle face!

09:01.894 --> 09:02.861
How many people are needed?

09:02.861 --> 09:04.624
At least three people.

09:05.831 --> 09:07.856
So we just need to find two more people.

09:13.238 --> 09:15.570
Why the hell was she on the ceiling?!

09:17.376 --> 09:21.244
Awesome angle. The angle that 
she came down in is super beautiful.

09:21.513 --> 09:25.807
[Sarutobi Ayame: Ninja from Oniwabanshuu.
Gintoki's stalker.]

09:26.251 --> 09:28.921
Perfect timing!
Come on, stand up, stalker.

09:28.921 --> 09:30.722
You're going to be a hostess tonight.

09:30.722 --> 09:32.491
No, no! Don't touch me!

09:32.491 --> 09:33.392
I'm not touching you. 

09:33.392 --> 09:35.694
This is the "Benizakura Arc,"

09:35.694 --> 09:38.390
but I don't really know much about it.
I wasn't able to debut in the first movie.

09:38.830 --> 09:42.596
I thought I finally got a role in part two, 
but I'm going to become a hostess?

09:43.702 --> 09:46.500
I'm a ninja for this?

09:47.539 --> 09:49.308
That's...

09:49.308 --> 09:52.471
way too exciting!

09:53.312 --> 09:56.281
What do you think is my most
charming point, Gin-san?

09:56.682 --> 09:59.551
Uh... I know that I said 
you're going to be a hostess, 

09:59.551 --> 10:02.611
but this is, this is... uh... very good.

10:03.722 --> 10:05.557
Now we just need one more person.

10:05.557 --> 10:07.388
Just two left, huh?

10:08.927 --> 10:11.725
That's too much. 
I'm going to cry.

10:12.497 --> 10:13.395
Sorry!

10:13.899 --> 10:15.890
I saw the ad posted outside.

10:15.890 --> 10:18.770
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

10:18.770 --> 10:19.759
What's the meaning of this?

10:19.938 --> 10:23.008
Huh? Did someone change the ad or something?

10:23.008 --> 10:26.612
Has it been replaced?
Is it some kind of prank?

10:26.612 --> 10:30.349
"Cute girls" was written on the ad, correct?

10:30.349 --> 10:32.651
Yes, that's absolutely correct.

10:32.651 --> 10:34.453
So why did this person come here then?

10:34.453 --> 10:35.852
What's wrong, Katsura-san?

10:36.321 --> 10:37.990
This Katsura Kotaro...

10:37.990 --> 10:42.324
The way I look now...
I'm cute after you put makeup on me.

10:42.461 --> 10:43.689
[That's right!]

10:44.730 --> 10:45.560
So?

10:45.697 --> 10:48.598
The funds of the Joui faction
is about to run out.

10:49.701 --> 10:53.438
And so I want to accompany you as a hostess.

10:53.438 --> 10:55.407
That's too reckless, Katsura-san.

10:55.407 --> 10:56.808
No matter how badly you need the...

10:56.808 --> 10:57.775
Please go put on makeup!

10:57.775 --> 10:59.500
What?!

11:00.279 --> 11:00.973
It's no good.

11:01.580 --> 11:04.674
The time limit has gotten closer
and the owner has lost all of his judgement.

11:07.919 --> 11:10.856
Hey, the little one crying over there...

11:10.856 --> 11:11.823
You too.

11:12.057 --> 11:16.328
Please stand up and get ready!

11:16.328 --> 11:18.697
Owner!

11:18.697 --> 11:21.689
I will follow you forever!

11:41.787 --> 11:44.656
- It's unexpectedly okay. 
- Yeah, really unexpected, but it's okay.

11:44.656 --> 11:47.759
Uh... Gin-san, hear me out really quick.

11:47.759 --> 11:51.963
I'm kind of worried about two of them.
Or, or, or, or... or actually all three of them.

11:51.963 --> 11:54.733
There's a chance that we may be asked
to change them pretty soon.

11:54.733 --> 11:57.002
Especially the two on the right.

11:57.002 --> 12:01.106
They seem to look like they have
come out of Gulliver's travels.

12:01.106 --> 12:04.409
So at least two more candidates are needed.

12:04.409 --> 12:06.912
The guests will be here in 30 minutes.

12:06.912 --> 12:08.447
Where are you going to find two more people?!

12:08.447 --> 12:11.583
I'm begging you!
The guests are very important!

12:11.583 --> 12:15.383
I know that!

12:15.587 --> 12:18.924
What's with today? 
There's hardly any girls here.

12:18.924 --> 12:23.122
It's okay.
There's a lot of girls inside.

12:26.700 --> 12:31.002
Hey, hey! What are you doing?
Get the hell over here.

12:31.002 --> 12:34.028
You see, everyone is here!

12:37.075 --> 12:40.611
[Matsudaira Katakuriko:
Chief of the Tokugawa Police Department]

12:40.746 --> 12:42.714
Welcome!

12:55.460 --> 12:58.691
Why? Why are those two...

12:58.997 --> 13:02.455
It couldn't be helped! 
We couldn't find two more people!

13:07.072 --> 13:09.040
I am Ginko.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.876
I am Pachi.

13:10.876 --> 13:14.141
Huh? There are so many ladies 
I'm seeing for the first time!

13:14.513 --> 13:15.673
Are you new here?

13:20.986 --> 13:22.487
Isn't that the Shinsengumi?

13:22.487 --> 13:24.022
He did say that the top of the Shogunate
would be here, didn't he?

13:24.022 --> 13:25.624
If they find out,
we'll become a laughing stock!

13:25.624 --> 13:27.159
It's also possible that 
we'll be arrested for fraud!

13:27.159 --> 13:28.854
Gin-san, what should we do?!

13:32.464 --> 13:34.099
Welcome.

13:34.099 --> 13:36.701
Gin-san!

13:36.701 --> 13:38.937
No way! Is he trying to disguise himself?

13:38.937 --> 13:41.667
Do you think it's acceptable? Hey!

13:41.873 --> 13:45.673
Stick out your chin.
Stick it out quickly.

13:46.178 --> 13:49.714
If you stick your chin out,
you won't be recognized.

13:49.714 --> 13:52.649
No, they will! 
Kagura-chan, help me out!

13:53.652 --> 13:57.522
I'm Blanco.
Pleased to meet you.

13:57.522 --> 14:00.125
She already did it.
She's already sticking out her chin!

14:00.125 --> 14:01.593
Holy crap! Katsura-san!

14:01.593 --> 14:02.761
The Shinsengumi are your nemesis!

14:02.761 --> 14:04.524
You can't show yourself, right?

14:05.497 --> 14:07.988
He stuck out his chin!

14:09.000 --> 14:10.228
I'm Katsurako.

14:11.837 --> 14:13.532
My hobby is rap music.

14:15.740 --> 14:17.476
It seems that they haven't noticed yet.

14:17.476 --> 14:18.977
It seems like sticking out the chin will work.

14:18.977 --> 14:21.713
There it is! There's someone 
who isn't sticking out their chin!

14:21.713 --> 14:25.171
Welcome.

14:25.884 --> 14:29.500
Hey, hey. We've got ourselves quite
a good looking female pig, don't we?

14:29.500 --> 14:33.920
Miss. How about I shove some more
nasty stuff into your nose?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Hey! 

14:35.160 --> 14:36.928
His sadistic heart is on fire!

14:36.928 --> 14:38.163
Don't say anything to him!

14:38.163 --> 14:40.757
Children won't be able 
to watch this film anymore!

14:45.804 --> 14:47.138
You can speak, huh?

14:47.138 --> 14:48.600
How can he understand you?!

14:48.607 --> 14:51.041
Sougo, just leave it at that.

14:51.510 --> 14:53.205
We're not here to have fun.

14:55.146 --> 14:58.582
Hey, don't hold back. 
Come and drink.

14:58.683 --> 15:00.742
No, not going to do that.

15:01.119 --> 15:04.990
Huh? They didn't come here to drink?
Thank goodness.

15:04.990 --> 15:09.094
Huh? Then, what are they doing here?

15:09.094 --> 15:11.296
Please take your time and enjoy yourself.

15:11.296 --> 15:13.287
We'll be on guard outside...

15:15.300 --> 15:17.000
Ue-Sama.
(Ue-Sama: shogun or Lord General)

15:28.179 --> 15:32.851
Gin-san... he just said "Ue-Sama," right?

15:32.851 --> 15:34.148
That he did.

15:34.653 --> 15:36.321
Hey... he just said "Ue-Sama."

15:36.321 --> 15:37.923
How could that be possible?

15:37.923 --> 15:40.859
There's no way a man like that
would come to our hostess club.

15:40.859 --> 15:42.594
Hey, you heard "Ue-Sama" too, right?

15:42.594 --> 15:44.996
It's a common name.

15:44.996 --> 15:47.232
He's just a customer named Uesama.

15:47.232 --> 15:50.099
- Hey, he said "Ue-Sama..."
- I heard "Uesugi-san."

15:55.807 --> 15:57.108
That's right, Shinpachi!

15:57.108 --> 15:59.311
It's impossible for a high-ranking shogun
to come to such a place!

15:59.311 --> 16:02.678
Come on, Shou-chan!
Have a drink already!

16:03.648 --> 16:05.917
He called him "Shou-chan" though...

16:05.917 --> 16:08.920
Shou-chan is such a cute way
to say your name.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.821
But... what's your real name?

16:13.892 --> 16:18.124
I'm the great general of the Shogunate,
Tokugawa Shigeshige.

16:19.364 --> 16:21.958
That's just my title.
Shou-chan is short for Shogun.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.271
Oh my! Geez!
You are so good at making jokes!

16:26.271 --> 16:28.273
What is your occupation?

16:28.273 --> 16:31.643
Being a general.

16:31.643 --> 16:33.945
I haven't heard of such a career.

16:33.945 --> 16:37.073
A general does make it sound like
you have a sense of justice.

16:38.950 --> 16:41.748
It's real.
He's a real Shogun.

16:44.950 --> 16:49.800
I'm so nervous, nervous, nervous, nervous...

17:01.373 --> 17:04.342
Owner!

17:09.200 --> 17:10.939
It's the real one!

17:11.750 --> 17:14.500
Unit Two! Unit Three
went to the back door!

17:15.700 --> 17:17.955
Otae-san!

17:17.955 --> 17:23.167
I, Kondo Isao, will protect
this store with my life!

17:26.031 --> 17:30.168
I will protect it!

17:30.168 --> 17:32.363
This guy is protecting the wrong person.

17:32.871 --> 17:35.840
He should have shouted,
"I'll protect the Shogun."

17:36.908 --> 17:39.778
But that old man is really bothersome.

17:39.778 --> 17:42.212
He actually took the general
on a tour of the night life.

17:42.881 --> 17:46.685
I heard that he was devoted to 
seeing the civilians' lives in Edo.

17:46.685 --> 17:49.454
But this hostess club
is a little weird, isn't it?

17:49.454 --> 17:51.156
There should be a lot of other ones out there.

17:51.156 --> 17:54.826
If he keeps on going out, 
he's going to be targeted.

17:54.826 --> 17:56.861
They're targeting the Amanto, aren't they?

17:56.861 --> 17:58.920
The Amanto and the Shogunate are the same.

17:59.397 --> 18:02.366
The Shogunate have become puppets
of their regime and their goal.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.324
I see.

18:05.103 --> 18:09.802
But isn't guarding like this causing a ruckus?
We're standing out way too much.

18:10.041 --> 18:12.134
That's why I was against this.

18:12.777 --> 18:16.235
If you are that worried,
then go and check the perimeter.

18:16.448 --> 18:20.077
There could be assassins or people
who are after the general around the corner.

18:23.455 --> 18:25.480
Vice Commander, I'll go too...

18:26.257 --> 18:29.056
Yamazaki, you don't have to.

18:34.866 --> 18:35.992
Zura!

18:36.968 --> 18:42.817
I'm gonna do it now Zura! I'm gonna do it Zura!
(zura: wig)

18:42.841 --> 18:47.369
Joui is joy. Joui is joy.
(joui: explusion of foreigners) 

18:49.848 --> 18:52.927
You mess with me, 
you gonna get divine punishment!
 319
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:54,462
Gin-san looks like a chimpanzee.

18:54.486 --> 18:57.046
The Shinsengumi aren't here,
but he is still sticking out his chin.

18:57.522 --> 19:01.335
And Katsura-san... Why does he 
want to perform this kind of rap?

19:01.359 --> 19:02.937
I don't understand.

19:02.961 --> 19:05.800
Alright. Let's switch to a different girl.

19:06.231 --> 19:07.800
The reason is because...

19:07.832 --> 19:09.823
she's too boring!

19:13.171 --> 19:16.951
Hey... Hey! Why?!
Why is that?!

19:16.975 --> 19:19.887
Rap is fun!
There's no way that it's boring!

19:19.911 --> 19:22.423
This is a message!
This is a message to the world!

19:22.447 --> 19:25.439
You shouldn't be rapping
in a hostess club anyway.

19:25.950 --> 19:27.360
Calm down, Shinpachi!

19:27.385 --> 19:29.964
As long as we finish this job,
we'll get a lot of money.

19:29.988 --> 19:31.832
Enough to pay the rent for ten years!

19:31.856 --> 19:33.801
But the risk is huge!

19:33.825 --> 19:36.037
If we screw up, our heads
may fall to the ground.

19:36.060 --> 19:39.005
That's why we have to be calm!

19:39.030 --> 19:41.042
You're telling me that, but you're
the one who needs to stay calm.

19:41.065 --> 19:44.110
Fortunately, those silly women
haven't realized the situation they're in.

19:44.135 --> 19:46.914
Don't mention the Shogun to them.

19:46.938 --> 19:50.117
Once they start to panic,
they will definitely fail.

19:50.141 --> 19:52.954
Hey, you pointy chin woman!

19:52.977 --> 19:55.855
School is about to close down, you know.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.814
Hey, you pig-tailed four-eyed girl!

19:58.016 --> 19:59.279
Come here!

20:02.420 --> 20:04.265
Is he calling for us?

20:04.289 --> 20:05.984
Of course, he is. Who else?

20:06.858 --> 20:08.223
By the way, Gintoki...

20:09.394 --> 20:11.192
Your dick is bulging out too much.

20:17.135 --> 20:19.467
Man, this task is such a pain in the ass.

20:21.973 --> 20:23.498
Ow!

20:31.850 --> 20:32.908
What the hell is this?

20:33.451 --> 20:38.412
Shinsengumi's Vice Commander,
Hijikata Toushiro!

20:41.125 --> 20:42.422
Well, look at that.

20:43.027 --> 20:45.271
We did make a big scene after all.

20:45.296 --> 20:47.341
What the hell are you saying?

20:47.365 --> 20:50.164
You are a samurai, 
yet you cater to the Amanto.

20:50.602 --> 20:53.264
You're just flattering yourself.
You truly are a traitor!

20:53.438 --> 20:57.432
It's our duty to repeal
those Amanto barbarians out of here!

20:58.042 --> 21:00.587
I'm here to protect the Shogun, right?

21:00.612 --> 21:04.173
Sorry, but I'm going to take on
these thugs by myself.

21:05.383 --> 21:07.181
Here I come!

21:11.356 --> 21:14.485
I'm sorry!

21:15.093 --> 21:17.585
Huh? What's going on?

21:18.930 --> 21:22.076
What... What am I doing?

21:22.100 --> 21:24.432
My body won't listen to me.

21:25.003 --> 21:27.904
I'm sorry!

21:28.172 --> 21:31.885
Please spare my life!
Take everything, but my life!

21:31.910 --> 21:34.555
I'm even willing to kiss
the soles of your sandals!

21:34.579 --> 21:36.411
My mouth is speaking on its own?!

21:39.350 --> 21:42.530
Who is this loser?

21:42.553 --> 21:44.964
"Hijikata Toushiro..."

21:44.989 --> 21:47.601
The "Demon Vice Commander"
that brings fear to everyone...

21:47.625 --> 21:49.684
What a load of rubbish!

21:51.229 --> 21:54.529
What's happening? I don't get it!
I don't get it at all!

21:54.699 --> 21:57.964
Strange as it is, 
it's a great opportunity!

21:58.102 --> 22:02.148
You've taken good care of us before 
and it's time for us to repay you now.

22:02.173 --> 22:03.231
Come on, come on.

22:03.474 --> 22:07.069
Hurry and lick the soles of my sandal.

22:10.281 --> 22:11.192
Quickly, lick it!

22:11.215 --> 22:12.614
Damn it!

22:14.652 --> 22:17.314
I don't know what's going on...

22:17.655 --> 22:20.022
But there's no way
I could do something like that!

22:23.628 --> 22:27.700
Please spare me by taking this.
There's still 3,000 yen inside. 

22:29.367 --> 22:31.500
But please don't take
my Tsutaya membership card.

22:32.370 --> 22:34.081
I want to borrow some DVDs.

22:34.105 --> 22:36.050
Stop trying to scare us to death!

22:36.074 --> 22:38.200
- How can an adult go out with only 3,000 yen?
- It's no use.

22:38.543 --> 22:42.741
I have no control over my body.

22:43.081 --> 22:45.140
The General game...

22:45.750 --> 22:49.311
Let's start!

22:50.388 --> 22:53.033
The rules are simple
because Shou-chan is the general.

22:53.057 --> 22:57.204
We'll change it from the King game
to the General game.

22:57.200 --> 23:02.400
Oh, Matsudaira-san, you silly goose! You're probably
thinking of dirty things again, aren't you?

23:02.400 --> 23:04.578
No, I'm the host tonight.

23:04.602 --> 23:07.128
I'll let Shou-chan
and the girls play by themselves.

23:08.539 --> 23:10.650
We'll take these chopsticks and have
the word "General" written on them...

23:10.675 --> 23:13.687
Matsudaira-sama! 
Please leave this to me!

23:13.711 --> 23:16.271
I can't have you work too hard.

23:17.615 --> 23:19.083
That's a great idea!  

23:19.417 --> 23:21.545
- Have at it, Megane-chan! (megane: glasses)
- Okay!

23:21.753 --> 23:23.414
Well done, Shinpachi!

23:23.654 --> 23:25.588
Let the Shogun draw the "General" stick.

23:26.057 --> 23:28.202
Alright! General! 

23:28.226 --> 23:31.526
Here we go!

23:37.702 --> 23:41.297
Why?! Why is everyone so serious?!

23:42.707 --> 23:44.141
That was fast!

23:44.542 --> 23:46.203
Where did the "General" stick go?

23:47.412 --> 23:48.789
I'm the General.

23:48.813 --> 23:50.491
Way to go, Gin-san!

23:50.515 --> 23:53.227
He read the situation
and got the right stick first.

23:53.251 --> 23:54.795
But what does it mean that 
Gin-san is the General?

23:54.819 --> 23:57.220
Now then...

23:57.555 --> 24:02.322
The person who got number four,
take off your clothes.

24:02.493 --> 24:03.337
I see!

24:03.361 --> 24:05.806
He's pleasing the Shogun this way!

24:05.830 --> 24:07.195
Way to go, Gin-san!

24:12.403 --> 24:15.304
It's the Shogun!

24:18.276 --> 24:21.255
This is bad. Why did the dumb 
Shogun get number four?

24:21.279 --> 24:23.624
He must be angry. 
He's totally angry.

24:23.648 --> 24:26.193
And to top it off,
he's wearing briefs.

24:26.217 --> 24:27.661
He's embarrassed.

24:27.685 --> 24:29.700
My family have been generals
for many generations.

24:29.787 --> 24:31.398
We have always worn briefs.

24:31.422 --> 24:34.235
Crap, he heard me. But why does
each generation wear briefs?

24:34.258 --> 24:37.237
Anyway, we need to get him dressed quickly!

24:37.261 --> 24:38.638
Otherwise, it's going to be off with our heads!

24:38.663 --> 24:40.300
It's you or me who needs
to draw the "General" stick.

24:40.300 --> 24:44.800
Yay! I'm the General this time!

24:44.800 --> 24:46.870
I let it slip again-aru.

24:46.871 --> 24:50.117
What?! What kind of sneaky plan are you guys
thinking of in the second round?!

24:50.141 --> 24:53.338
What should I do?

24:54.645 --> 24:59.183
Then, how about the person
who got number three...

24:59.183 --> 25:02.800
lend their clothes to someone 

25:02.854 --> 25:05.414
who looks the coldest?

25:06.157 --> 25:09.470
Big Sis! She understands everything!
She can see it in our eyes!

25:09.494 --> 25:12.555
She can control the situation
on the spot! What a pro!

25:16.901 --> 25:20.180
It's the Shogun!

25:20.204 --> 25:23.617
Oh no, this movie is over.
It's been pixelated like porn...

25:23.641 --> 25:25.886
This version of the movie
is going to be clipped in China.

25:25.910 --> 25:29.189
The General is not down there.
That's a small soldier.

25:29.213 --> 25:30.800
My family have been generals
for many generations.

25:31.349 --> 25:33.894
We've always had small soldiers down there.

25:33.918 --> 25:35.563
Oh crap, he heard that.

25:35.586 --> 25:37.563
This is going to guarantee us
a trip to the guillotine.

25:37.588 --> 25:40.285
Hey, this is kind of stinky.
Can I take it off please?

25:42.460 --> 25:43.571
Wait!

25:43.594 --> 25:46.739
The Shogun's eyes are full of tears!
He's crying! He's definitely crying!

25:46.764 --> 25:49.209
At this rate, we just have to
book it out of here!

25:49.233 --> 25:51.812
Tada! I'm the General this turn-aru.

25:51.836 --> 25:53.304
Again with this?!

25:55.306 --> 25:59.219
The one who has number two needs to go
to the convenience store to buy briefs!

25:59.243 --> 26:01.855
Kagura!

26:01.879 --> 26:03.791
That's to be expected
from a member of the Yorozuya!

26:03.814 --> 26:06.592
You read the atmosphere,
didn't you? Thanks!

26:06.617 --> 26:07.812
I'll be back soon.

26:07.952 --> 26:11.547
It's still the Shogun!

26:19.363 --> 26:23.391
Not good.
At this rate... I'll die.

26:23.568 --> 26:24.592
Hey!

26:29.207 --> 26:30.697
That's a familiar uniform.

26:33.978 --> 26:35.742
That's a familiar sword style.

26:53.931 --> 26:54.898
You are...

26:55.433 --> 26:58.712
I want to say that a Shinsengumi 
was attacked by a group of rogues,

26:58.736 --> 27:00.500
so I just rushed over.

27:04.675 --> 27:06.473
What are you doing in a place like this...

27:09.647 --> 27:10.739
Hijikata-kun?

27:11.816 --> 27:13.978
[Shinsengumi Station]

27:14.952 --> 27:18.013
Let's toast to the return of Itou Kamotarou!

27:18.456 --> 27:19.389
Cheers!

27:19.557 --> 27:21.821
Cheers!

27:25.963 --> 27:30.457
Hey, Itou-sensei. I'm sorry 
to be too busy on the day of your return.

27:30.668 --> 27:32.700
I heard a little about it, but...
did something happen to the Shogun?

27:32.700 --> 27:37.700
No, no, no... Matsudaira just took him out
to have some fun is all that happened.

27:37.775 --> 27:39.453
Seriously...

27:39.477 --> 27:43.880
The people up top don't understand
all the trouble that we go through.

27:45.883 --> 27:49.500
We have to forget about getting rid of
the Amanto in order to get stronger.

27:49.500 --> 27:50.998
Is that why they went out to have fun?

27:51.022 --> 27:54.000
Well, everything he does
is out of goodwill.

27:54.992 --> 27:55.959
Kondo-san.

27:57.561 --> 27:59.839
There are a number of these
kinds of offices in the Shogunate.

27:59.864 --> 28:01.800
Sooner or later, there's a chance
that this country will perish.

28:02.300 --> 28:05.736
We can't always be in this place.

28:07.471 --> 28:08.800
We need to move forward!

28:09.507 --> 28:12.807
Towards a higher goal!

28:13.477 --> 28:16.622
Then, we will become the sword
that supports this country as the backbone!

28:16.647 --> 28:19.514
We need to save this country from its coma!

28:19.917 --> 28:23.478
It is the duty of us samurai.

28:24.588 --> 28:27.649
For this reason, 
I will even sacrifice lives.

28:28.559 --> 28:30.687
Do you see how serious I am?

28:31.762 --> 28:34.060
Kondo-san, let's do our best!

28:34.598 --> 28:35.690
Let's do it!

28:37.802 --> 28:41.705
But... why do they call him sensei?

28:41.939 --> 28:44.670
Itou is a rookie
who only joined us this year.

28:45.443 --> 28:48.037
He also has the same title as us.

28:49.080 --> 28:51.091
Well, I guess it's not impossible.

28:51.115 --> 28:54.027
He is super smart
and his work ability is good.

28:54.051 --> 28:57.612
He's also a master of the sword too.

28:58.089 --> 29:00.524
The Vice Commander is also very smart.

29:00.725 --> 29:03.456
But he's just a tactician.

29:03.761 --> 29:06.540
As far as politics go,
only that guy is sufficient.

29:06.564 --> 29:11.058
Wow, Sensei! You can really 
hold your liquor, can't you?

29:12.403 --> 29:13.529
Kondo-san.

29:15.740 --> 29:18.505
Can you stop calling him sensei?

29:25.116 --> 29:29.713
What's wrong with calling the person 
who is teaching you, sensei?

30:10.494 --> 30:11.723
Hijikata-kun.

30:14.031 --> 30:15.795
I have something to ask you.

30:16.734 --> 30:19.795
What a coincidence.
I do too.

30:20.004 --> 30:21.199
You... 

30:21.739 --> 30:23.707
hate me, don't you?

30:25.810 --> 30:29.556
I'm a rookie, but Kondo-san
appreciates me.

30:29.580 --> 30:33.175
My promotion is so fast
that even your status is threatened.

30:34.051 --> 30:35.562
You must think I'm an eyesore, huh?

30:35.586 --> 30:37.054
That's you.

30:37.521 --> 30:39.890
You want to quickly get promoted to the top,
but you have to go through me.

30:39.890 --> 30:43.485
I've been at the top since forever,
so that must make me an eyesore for you, right?

30:45.629 --> 30:47.495
You worry too much, Hijikata-kun.

30:48.165 --> 30:50.497
I'm not thinking that at all.

30:50.734 --> 30:51.602
That's good. 

30:51.602 --> 30:54.602
It seems that our misunderstanding 
has been cleared up.

30:55.105 --> 30:56.834
You're an eyesore.

30:57.541 --> 31:00.067
I'm not something cute like that.

31:03.714 --> 31:05.993
I'll kill you sooner or later.

31:06.016 --> 31:07.745
[Samurai Barber Shop]

31:09.520 --> 31:11.181
[Shave, perm, shave, tie hair, dig ears...]

31:12.723 --> 31:15.235
You know what?
This is weird, isn't it?

31:15.259 --> 31:18.004
They asked us to take care of the shop
while the owner was away.

31:18.028 --> 31:20.190
Big jobs are too dangerous after all.

31:20.698 --> 31:22.757
Didn't you learn your lesson
at the hostess club yesterday?

31:23.167 --> 31:27.001
Let's save up money slowly
by doing normal jobs.

31:27.271 --> 31:29.150
No, that's not it.

31:29.174 --> 31:34.588
I'm talking about how weird it is to hand over 
a barber shop to people who don't have licenses.

31:34.612 --> 31:38.592
They have the complete
manga collection of Golgo 17-aru.

31:38.616 --> 31:40.127
I want to stay here for a few days.

31:40.150 --> 31:43.896
He doesn't want people to think
that the store is closed.

31:43.921 --> 31:46.253
He told us that all
we have to do is be here.

31:46.991 --> 31:49.202
They just opened a fashion salon
across the street called Biyouin.

31:49.226 --> 31:51.805
He said that nobody will come here,
so we'll be okay.

31:51.829 --> 31:53.923
If no guests are going to come, 
then he should just close the store.

31:54.064 --> 31:55.841
Huh? Now that I look closer at it...

31:55.866 --> 31:58.512
Golgo 17 is missing the 18th volume-aru!

31:58.536 --> 32:00.000
Gin-san, where is the 18th volume?

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
How am I supposed to know?!

32:01.000 --> 32:03.070
It might be mixed in with the
other volumes! Look closer!

32:03.073 --> 32:05.685
Shinpachi! Hurry and help me find it!

32:05.709 --> 32:08.576
Come on, Kagura-chan,
we are here to work.

32:11.982 --> 32:12.972
Not good!

32:17.121 --> 32:18.598
Hello!

32:18.622 --> 32:20.852
Hello, adults who are working hard!

32:26.697 --> 32:28.008
What's with those guys?

32:28.032 --> 32:29.676
Why are they investigating the barber shop?

32:29.700 --> 32:33.637
Hey! I've come to return
the 18th volume of Golgo 17.

32:35.105 --> 32:36.001
Huh?

32:37.341 --> 32:38.809
The boss is not here.

32:42.813 --> 32:45.192
Don't tell me...

32:45.215 --> 32:48.294
Katakuriko...
What is this place?

32:48.319 --> 32:50.287
I always go to this barber shop.

32:50.721 --> 32:53.948
I wanted you to meet my buddy,
but he's not here today.

32:54.658 --> 32:56.023
That's too bad!

32:56.660 --> 33:00.107
Maybe we should go to
the hostess club again?

33:00.130 --> 33:02.975
Eh? Why? Why?

33:03.000 --> 33:06.113
What kind of hairpins are used here?

33:06.136 --> 33:08.500
Why do we meet them everywhere we go?

33:08.500 --> 33:10.966
That has to be...

33:12.176 --> 33:13.337
Will you...

33:15.980 --> 33:17.324
do my hair?

33:17.348 --> 33:20.249
It's the Shogun!

33:27.958 --> 33:29.016
Would you look at that?

33:29.760 --> 33:32.388
Katakuriko went off
to have fun alone.

33:33.330 --> 33:37.289
Is it okay to leave the Shogun 
by himself in that barber shop?

33:37.668 --> 33:42.500
He told us that he wants to see the daily life
of the Edo people, so there's nothing we can do.

33:52.650 --> 33:54.914
How do you fall in love
with that kind of crap?

34:00.324 --> 34:02.500
I just started watching this
without realizing it...

34:04.161 --> 34:05.424
You're bothering me.

34:05.963 --> 34:09.194
You've been violating 
the bureau's laws since yesterday.

34:09.800 --> 34:13.746
Hijikata-san... you're the one
who set those laws.

34:13.771 --> 34:16.149
As a result, your cellphone rang
during a meeting

34:16.172 --> 34:18.501
and then some online shopping results
appeared for weird Anime figures.

34:18.976 --> 34:22.289
Then, you start talking about Anime
with the people you are torturing.

34:22.312 --> 34:24.713
And then you let them go free, don't you?

34:25.248 --> 34:26.273
Also...

34:27.184 --> 34:29.243
everyone knows what happened last night.

34:31.021 --> 34:35.254
I bet. And it's not like
that bastard can't say anything.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.821
It seems like my personality
is being possessed by someone else.

34:40.364 --> 34:43.958
No, it's not my personality.

34:44.735 --> 34:49.803
It's like the loser inside of me
is being awakened.

34:50.808 --> 34:54.072
What are you talking about?
You were always a loser, weren't you?

34:54.478 --> 34:55.946
That's true...

34:57.214 --> 35:00.214
Someone like me...

35:00.214 --> 35:03.000
has always been a loser from the start.

35:03.053 --> 35:06.887
Oh my! You've actually turned into a nutcase.

35:07.424 --> 35:09.153
Is that what happened?

35:09.460 --> 35:12.500
Is it because you and Kondo-san got into
a big fight in the middle of the night?

35:12.500 --> 35:13.740
Is that the reason?

35:13.764 --> 35:15.960
Not exactly...

35:19.470 --> 35:21.802
I wish that were the case.

35:22.406 --> 35:25.952
Are you worried that Itou-sensei 
will steal the Shinsengumi?

35:25.976 --> 35:28.822
I'm not sure... 
But at the rate he's going,

35:28.846 --> 35:31.024
he has reached your level
and even surpassed you.

35:31.048 --> 35:36.463
Toushi! I think that Itou-sensei
is necessary for the Shinsengumi!

35:36.487 --> 35:39.766
Kondo-san! You don't get it at all!

35:39.790 --> 35:42.316
Organizations can't be led by big talk alone!

35:45.062 --> 35:46.894
What do you think
is the root cause of this?

35:48.031 --> 35:49.294
It's hard to say.

35:50.400 --> 35:54.748
Ever since my patrol yesterday,
my neck has been hurting.

35:54.772 --> 35:56.536
Let me see! Let me see!

35:59.276 --> 36:00.402
What the hell is this?

36:00.978 --> 36:03.072
Is this a new variety of loser bugs?

36:03.413 --> 36:05.507
Let me have the escort mission.
You go back first.

36:07.050 --> 36:09.849
When you're with me, you're going
to be looked down on by Itou.

36:11.455 --> 36:13.219
Alright, I'll take you up on that offer.

36:18.028 --> 36:21.157
Hijikata-san.
I have a favor to ask of you.

36:23.934 --> 36:26.995
We're going to do the Shogun's hair? 
But we don't even have a license!

36:27.304 --> 36:29.432
If we mess up even a little bit...

36:30.040 --> 36:32.441
All three of our heads
will be rolling on the floor.

36:35.045 --> 36:37.878
He's vomiting!

36:38.515 --> 36:39.893
What a wimp-aru.

36:39.917 --> 36:43.296
I don't know about generals,
but aren't their hairstyles all the same?

36:43.320 --> 36:45.220
- Let me handle this! 
- You're going to?

36:45.923 --> 36:47.857
Welcome!

36:49.526 --> 36:52.004
What kind of hairstyle do you want today?

36:52.029 --> 36:54.207
Do you want it combed high?
Do you want it shaved?

36:54.231 --> 36:56.256
Or do you...

36:57.334 --> 37:01.032
There it goes!

37:05.342 --> 37:07.921
What the hell are you doing?!
Do you want to die?!

37:07.945 --> 37:10.156
I got a whiff of Shinpachi's vomit
and it affected me-aru.

37:10.180 --> 37:12.592
It affected you? What if it sprays 
onto the Shogun, what are you going to do?

37:12.616 --> 37:13.913
Can you...

37:14.585 --> 37:16.314
help me restyle my hair?

37:17.988 --> 37:20.218
Can you shave the top?

37:22.092 --> 37:24.322
Yes! Understood!

37:24.628 --> 37:26.357
Hey, he asked to shave his head.

37:27.130 --> 37:30.109
Restyle his hair and shave the top...
Who's going to do it?

37:30.133 --> 37:33.512
My hands are shaking so hard
and they can't stop.

37:33.537 --> 37:35.382
I voluntarily quit!

37:35.405 --> 37:37.499
- I'll go! 
- Really?

37:38.108 --> 37:40.304
- Don't throw up again. 
- Trust me-aru.

37:42.512 --> 37:45.004
She is shaving it really well.

37:45.515 --> 37:48.109
Maybe she shaved her dad's hair before?

37:50.587 --> 37:53.557
It's possible.

37:56.460 --> 37:58.019
Not bad. Not bad.

38:02.966 --> 38:05.025
It's not bad.

38:21.985 --> 38:25.613
What... is that?

38:29.226 --> 38:30.557
What is it exactly?

38:34.064 --> 38:37.694
That's... probably it, huh?

38:38.335 --> 38:39.325
The Shogun's...

38:44.474 --> 38:47.419
How disgraceful!
You have to keep this place clean!

38:47.444 --> 38:50.675
There's a golden retriever's
poop on the ground!

38:52.149 --> 38:54.174
No, that's not right!

38:55.052 --> 38:56.629
That's the Shogun's hairbun.

38:56.653 --> 38:59.632
Even if you destroy the evidence at the speed 
of light, it doesn't solve the problem!

38:59.656 --> 39:00.700
No!

39:00.724 --> 39:03.036
That's 100% a golden retriever's shit!

39:03.060 --> 39:05.300
Regardless of the color,
size, or other factors,

39:05.300 --> 39:07.272
that was definitely shit
from a golden retriever!

39:07.297 --> 39:08.541
There's no room for explanation!

39:08.565 --> 39:11.311
Where the hell is the golden retriever then?!

39:11.335 --> 39:12.679
It's okay.

39:12.703 --> 39:14.467
It's definitely going to be okay.

39:15.105 --> 39:18.564
His hair is just a little bit shorter is all.
It's still possible to tie up a bun.

39:19.042 --> 39:23.172
I'm going to tie it.
Yeah, we can still tie it. 

39:27.718 --> 39:32.485
Now then...
Please let me tie it!

39:39.162 --> 39:43.065
It's not long enough at all!

39:43.433 --> 39:46.630
I told you that it's impossible!

39:47.738 --> 39:49.729
Don't say that...

39:53.610 --> 39:56.102
Just a little bit more... like this...

39:56.780 --> 39:59.215
Pull it up!

40:01.218 --> 40:03.596
Gin-san!

40:03.620 --> 40:07.420
The Shogun is crying!

40:08.058 --> 40:11.438
The Shogun is at his limit! 

40:11.461 --> 40:15.420
His face is bursting!

40:15.632 --> 40:18.533
Stop it! I'm begging you! 

40:21.538 --> 40:24.132
Stop!

40:27.444 --> 40:30.607
Gin-san, don't pull anymore! Let him go!

40:33.116 --> 40:35.517
No!

40:39.222 --> 40:42.590
The bun is tied now.

40:43.293 --> 40:45.338
His face has totally changed...

40:45.362 --> 40:47.797
His skin is super tight!

40:51.201 --> 40:54.380
I wonder if he likes it...
He's smiling.

40:54.404 --> 40:57.417
He's not smiling! His face
is pulled apart like that!

40:57.441 --> 41:01.639
I'm sorry! I'll fix it right up!
It hurt a bit, didn't it?

41:02.279 --> 41:03.747
How are you going to fix it?!

41:04.381 --> 41:06.259
Pick up the hairbun 
that you just threw outside!

41:06.283 --> 41:09.218
I'll stick it back on
and return it back to normal!

41:09.653 --> 41:11.143
Got it!

41:14.858 --> 41:16.849
It's gone! 
Where's the hairbun?

41:17.494 --> 41:18.655
Where is it?

41:19.129 --> 41:21.097
Gin-san! I found it-aru!

41:21.364 --> 41:23.628
Well done, Kagura!

41:44.588 --> 41:46.147
Why is it pixelated?

41:46.556 --> 41:49.150
And... it kind of stinks.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.405
I finally found it-aru.

41:52.429 --> 41:54.397
A golden retriever's poop.

42:05.609 --> 42:09.705
Toushi sure is late. 
The meeting has already started.

42:10.213 --> 42:12.181
This meeting is very important too.

42:12.449 --> 42:14.594
Kondo-san, this is perfect timing.

42:14.618 --> 42:17.315
I want to have a discussion about him.

42:20.590 --> 42:24.720
I'm sure you're all aware about 
his behavior these past two days.

42:25.695 --> 42:29.675
He imposed strict discipline for his team.

42:29.699 --> 42:31.565
But now he has violated
several of these rules.

42:32.169 --> 42:35.901
He's even late to the meeting now.

42:36.540 --> 42:39.500
Even if he doesn't get punished, 
he needs to explain his actions to the team.

42:39.500 --> 42:41.386
Sensei, please wait a minute!

42:41.411 --> 42:43.223
Toushi must have his reasons for being late...

42:43.246 --> 42:45.772
I'm not only talking about this meeting.

42:46.783 --> 42:51.550
Of course, I know that he has made very big
contributions to the Shinsengumi thus far.

42:51.821 --> 42:56.657
Without him, there would be 
no Shinsengumi like there is today.

42:56.960 --> 43:00.954
That's why I'm very reluctant
in making these kinds of suggestions.

43:02.232 --> 43:04.844
He's the symbol and role model
of the Shinsengumi.

43:04.868 --> 43:06.859
But what are we going to do about him?

43:07.470 --> 43:09.201
Once he violates the rules,

43:09.206 --> 43:12.200
naturally, he has to accept
the punishments...

43:13.443 --> 43:17.557
that everyone else gets.

43:17.581 --> 43:21.361
But because it's him,
he should have a severe punishment.

43:21.384 --> 43:22.928
Kondo-san, please handle it wisely.

43:22.953 --> 43:25.923
Hold on.
Toushi must be...

43:26.556 --> 43:28.801
Sorry I'm late, Okita-san!

43:28.825 --> 43:32.504
I found Dragon Quest 11 in a small 
electronics shop in the countryside!

43:32.529 --> 43:36.342
The lastest volume of One Piece
is out of stock everywhere,

43:36.366 --> 43:38.494
but it just happened to be 
in that conveniece store over there!

43:42.739 --> 43:45.674
Damn it!
He set me up!

43:49.613 --> 43:51.308
These guys...

43:52.449 --> 43:54.918
joined forces and framed me!

43:57.854 --> 43:59.799
[Otaku Summit]

43:59.823 --> 44:02.669
[Host Tahara Naijie]
The phenomenon of Neets and Hikkimori's...

44:02.692 --> 44:06.406
A large number of dispirited
young people have emerged.

44:06.429 --> 44:09.975
The Otaku are considered
a no good group of people.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.878
I found 100 of them today.

44:11.901 --> 44:15.480
The young people claiming to be an Otaku

44:15.505 --> 44:18.484
will tell us their outlook on life.

44:18.508 --> 44:21.888
And the Hikkimori will explain to us
why they don't leave their homes.

44:21.911 --> 44:23.955
Let's explore this in depth.

44:23.980 --> 44:25.491
Not good!

44:25.515 --> 44:29.729
No matter what job I try to look for,
the Shogun is always there.

44:29.753 --> 44:32.723
Holy crap! The show
has started already-aru!

44:33.757 --> 44:35.435
What are you doing?

44:35.458 --> 44:37.969
I need to record Shinpachi on this show!

44:37.994 --> 44:42.441
Oh, Shinpachi said that
he couldn't go to work today.

44:42.465 --> 44:44.024
But I'm not in the mood to go though.

44:45.900 --> 44:51.772
Ah, rent... What am I going
to do about the rent?

44:52.409 --> 44:55.401
Today, we have two groups of people here.

44:55.679 --> 44:58.758
Representatives of Anime Otaku and Idol Otaku.

44:58.782 --> 45:03.481
I hope everyone can share
their views with enthusiasm.

45:04.054 --> 45:08.355
Now, please raise your hand 
if you want to express your opinion first!

45:09.092 --> 45:12.872
Then, we'll start with number 53 
who raised his hand the fastest.

45:12.896 --> 45:19.979
I would like people to reconsider the stereotype
that all Otaku are Neets and Hikkimori's.

45:20.003 --> 45:21.970
[Captain of Terakado Tsu Fanclub, Shinpachi]
There are Otaku's out there 

45:21.971 --> 45:24.082
[Captain of Terakado Tsu Fanclub, Shinpachi]
who have jobs and work hard in our society!

45:24.107 --> 45:24.951
He's right.

45:24.974 --> 45:26.785
What's that guy doing?

45:26.810 --> 45:27.920
Did you forget?

45:27.944 --> 45:30.890
Shinpachi is the captain of 
the idol Terakado Tsu-chan fanclub.

45:30.914 --> 45:33.960
I know that, but what is he up to?

45:33.983 --> 45:37.896
We are just investing
in the things that we love.

45:37.921 --> 45:40.066
There's absolutely nothing 
to be embarrassed about.

45:40.090 --> 45:41.034
Yeah!

45:41.057 --> 45:44.803
I see. Then, let's have number 31 speak...

45:44.828 --> 45:46.939
This program targets the Otaku.

45:46.963 --> 45:51.511
They are attempting 
to stigmatize our behavior!

45:51.534 --> 45:53.879
- That's the problem with Japan today!
- Okay, okay, okay, we understand.

45:53.903 --> 45:56.838
Hey... He's being really annoying.

45:57.006 --> 45:59.417
He's going to be thrown out by the audience.

45:59.442 --> 46:02.355
Number 31, what do you think
of number 53's opinions?

46:02.379 --> 46:06.043
It's problematic to generalize the Otaku.

46:07.650 --> 46:09.628
He's starting to get fired up-aru!

46:09.652 --> 46:12.130
No, no...
He needs to stop.

46:12.155 --> 46:15.868
I need to hurry and record!
Otherwise, it's going to be a waste!

46:15.892 --> 46:20.773
We are at least cheering
for idols in real life.

46:20.797 --> 46:26.779
I don't understand why people
fall in love with girls in Anime or games.

46:26.803 --> 46:27.580
Hey!

46:27.604 --> 46:30.116
What do you mean by that, number 53?!

46:30.140 --> 46:33.819
If you fall in love with 2D girls,
you will never get any results.

46:33.843 --> 46:36.489
Isn't it just a waste of time?

46:36.513 --> 46:37.723
Don't give us that bullshit!

46:37.747 --> 46:40.808
Sonoka-chan lives in my heart!

46:41.151 --> 46:44.500
I want to refute that.
Will you let me?

46:45.021 --> 46:46.165
Um...

46:46.165 --> 46:48.158
[Anime Otaku, Toushi]
Number 53 is saying that...

46:48.158 --> 46:53.840
they're living more in reality 
because they like 3D while we like 2D, but...

46:53.863 --> 46:55.194
Can I ask you something?

46:55.765 --> 47:01.900
Do you think that you're going to be able to 
marry those idols you're cheering on someday?

47:03.139 --> 47:04.100
Well, that's...

47:04.100 --> 47:05.100
You can't, right?

47:05.875 --> 47:12.040
So basically, even though it's 3D or 2D,
we will both end up with a loveless outcome.

47:12.048 --> 47:15.495
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

47:15.518 --> 47:17.612
It's not the same!
They are different!

47:17.921 --> 47:21.000
Indeed, it's hard for fans
to marry their idols,

47:21.024 --> 47:22.602
but it's not 100% impossible!

47:22.625 --> 47:23.760
It's 100% impossible for you guys though!

47:23.760 --> 47:25.228
No, that's not true.

47:26.129 --> 47:27.106
Without a doubt.

47:27.130 --> 47:29.800
It's not impossible? After all,
idols exist in reality.

47:29.800 --> 47:33.670
No, this unrealistic idea
shows that you ignore reality.

47:33.670 --> 47:37.231
You bastard! How dare you speak
to our captain like that?!

47:37.841 --> 47:39.104
Go!

47:41.110 --> 47:44.823
Oh boy! The Idol and Anime Otakus are fighting!

47:44.848 --> 47:46.826
That Toushi guy is pissing me off-aru!

47:46.850 --> 47:48.060
Get him! Get him!

47:48.084 --> 47:51.664
Hey, I don't want to see 
the scuffle among the Otaku's.

47:51.688 --> 47:53.699
In the end, I couldn't record it.

47:53.723 --> 47:55.067
This machine is broken.

47:55.091 --> 47:57.170
It's too big! Of course,
that's not going to fit in there!

47:57.193 --> 47:58.661
Where did you find it?!

48:00.163 --> 48:01.153
Huh?

48:02.131 --> 48:04.896
Is that guy... him?

48:08.705 --> 48:13.575
Okita-kun, I'm surprise that you trust me.

48:14.844 --> 48:18.906
I heard that you two knew each other
before the establishment of the Shinsengumi.

48:19.916 --> 48:23.696
I thought you were completely on
Hijikata's side.

48:23.720 --> 48:25.051
Hijikata's?

48:25.822 --> 48:30.817
Is there such a faction? 
That's the first time I've heard about it.

48:33.062 --> 48:35.929
You're really a shrewd man. 
What do you want?

48:36.933 --> 48:40.767
I want the position
of Vice Commander, of course.

48:44.073 --> 48:45.268
Your wish...

48:47.844 --> 48:49.710
I promise to help you achieve it.

48:57.720 --> 48:59.017
Are you okay with this?

48:59.255 --> 49:02.748
I don't mind if he wants to be
the Vice Commander.

49:03.226 --> 49:06.890
But why are you trying
to get rid of Hijikata?

49:07.330 --> 49:08.855
Shinohara-kun...

49:09.933 --> 49:19.332
Do you think I got into the senseless battle with
Hijikata-kun in order to become Vice Commander?

49:20.810 --> 49:23.905
Do you even understand
what I'm doing, Shinohara-kun?

49:24.881 --> 49:29.045
Do you know what the greatest 
misfortune of the Samurai is?

49:29.852 --> 49:31.980
It is something that can't be understood.

49:33.122 --> 49:35.819
No matter how talented you are...

49:36.726 --> 49:38.717
No matter how hard you try...

49:38.995 --> 49:44.024
If you don't understand, then you won't 
be able to assess this question.

49:45.134 --> 49:48.593
I've never had a true companion.

49:50.239 --> 49:53.300
I've never had one when I became
a child prodigy in school.

49:53.776 --> 49:58.304
And I've never had one when I 
mastered the ways of the sword.

49:59.916 --> 50:03.978
Later on, I had to withstand the trend 
of trying to get rid of the Amanto.

50:05.655 --> 50:11.651
But my heart's desire
has never been satisfied.

50:12.061 --> 50:13.756
It never occurred to me...

50:14.931 --> 50:17.161
that I would find a friend in this place.

50:17.934 --> 50:20.279
However...

50:20.303 --> 50:25.738
my greatest misfortune is the person
who knows me the most is my biggest enemy.

50:29.312 --> 50:31.007
Wait until Hijikata is removed.

50:32.949 --> 50:34.110
Then...

50:35.718 --> 50:37.846
after Kondo Isao is assassinated...

50:38.988 --> 50:42.686
the Shinsengumi will be mine.

50:44.293 --> 50:46.100
That guy really is after
the Vice Commander.

50:46.102 --> 50:48.932
I need to hurry and inform him!

50:57.440 --> 50:59.885
I'm really sorry.

50:59.909 --> 51:02.037
I didn't expect you to be there...

51:02.879 --> 51:03.800
Hijikata-san.

51:04.414 --> 51:06.849
No...
It's okay.

51:08.384 --> 51:10.128
As long as this limited edition

51:10.153 --> 51:15.968
super premium Kosai Sonoka 1/8 scaled 
Anime figure is unharmed, then it's all good.

51:15.992 --> 51:17.858
- Eh? 
- Eh?

51:18.261 --> 51:19.228
Um...

51:20.229 --> 51:24.175
Are you... really Hijikata-san?

51:24.200 --> 51:26.312
What are you talking about, Sakatashi?

51:26.335 --> 51:27.359
Sakatashi?!

51:29.872 --> 51:31.500
Here, have a look!

51:31.500 --> 51:32.700
[Shinsengumi Vice Commander: Hijikata Toushiro]
I am the real

51:32.700 --> 51:34.787
Hijikata Toushiro de gozaru!
(de gozaru: old timey way of ending a sentence)

51:34.811 --> 51:35.937
Gozaru?!

51:37.080 --> 51:39.291
Whoa! Kagurashi!

51:39.315 --> 51:42.478
That outfit is a Papaya Chinese girl
cosplay outfit, isn't it?

51:46.489 --> 51:48.890
It must have been expensive to make.

51:49.492 --> 51:51.893
Can I get a few pictures of it?

51:53.463 --> 51:55.192
Then, stand there please!

51:55.865 --> 51:56.991
Alright!

51:58.034 --> 52:00.230
Here I go!
I'm taking them now!

52:01.871 --> 52:04.863
So cute!

52:05.241 --> 52:06.285
You're so cute!

52:06.309 --> 52:07.799
Why is she acting all shy?

52:08.945 --> 52:14.093
Can you give me more Papaya poses? 
Some more poses! A few more Papaya poses!

52:14.117 --> 52:17.000
Aw... Nice! Nice!
A gorgeous Papaya! 

52:17.000 --> 52:20.766
Gorgeous Papaya! Gorgeous Papaya!
Oh, a Papaya spin!

52:20.790 --> 52:22.501
- Thank you! 
- Papaya!

52:22.525 --> 52:26.405
Can you pose into the camera? Pose into the camera!
This camera can't take it! This camera can't take it!

52:26.429 --> 52:30.476
Okay! How about a once-in-a-millennium pose next?

52:30.500 --> 52:32.044
Ready, set...

52:32.068 --> 52:34.747
That's it! Great!

52:34.771 --> 52:36.315
Thanks! I've been waiting for this
for a long time, I really have!

52:36.339 --> 52:38.831
Thank you!

52:39.242 --> 52:41.120
Thanks.
Thank you so much.

52:41.144 --> 52:44.114
Can you cosplay as Love Punk next time? 

52:44.413 --> 52:48.475
Is that okay? If you do,
I will be very happy de gozaru!

52:51.854 --> 52:54.380
So cute. 
Thank you.

52:58.261 --> 52:59.805
Um, Hijikata-san...

52:59.829 --> 53:01.126
What is it, Shimurashi?

53:01.931 --> 53:05.010
What happened to your job? What are you 
doing out here in broad daylight?

53:05.034 --> 53:06.045
My job?

53:06.068 --> 53:07.092
Yes.

53:08.471 --> 53:10.963
If you're talking about the Shinsengumi,
I was fired de gozaru.

53:12.963 --> 53:14.177
What?!

53:14.177 --> 53:17.022
You quit the Shinsengumi?!

53:17.046 --> 53:18.104
Why?!

53:18.381 --> 53:21.407
I got bored with having
unnecessary relationships.

53:21.851 --> 53:23.376
It's a dangerous job too.

53:24.020 --> 53:27.433
I'm looking for ways
to survive without working.

53:27.456 --> 53:29.467
I think that once you start working,
you have admitted defeat.

53:29.492 --> 53:33.395
You're a Neet.
You're thinking like a total Neet!

53:34.096 --> 53:37.175
Is that so? You guys look like
pretty big Neets too.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.577
Who the hell is a Neet?!

53:38.601 --> 53:41.093
We are hard-working workers now!

53:41.404 --> 53:43.065
Of course, of course.
By the way, Sakatashi...

53:43.406 --> 53:45.170
You like manga too, right?

53:46.475 --> 53:49.800
Since yesterday, I've started drawing
a Love Punk doujinshi, 

53:49.800 --> 53:52.882
but do you want to sell it at 
the Summer Comic Con with me?!

53:53.349 --> 53:56.444
Do you think these children sketches
are going to sell?!

53:57.253 --> 53:59.298
What should we do, Gin-san?

53:59.322 --> 54:02.134
Does a person's personality change 
this much in a short period of time?

54:02.158 --> 54:04.456
The demon-like Vice Commander is gone now-aru.

54:05.261 --> 54:07.252
[Gengai's Workshop]

54:13.002 --> 54:14.436
I see.

54:15.271 --> 54:16.500
It's his neck.

54:17.139 --> 54:22.401
It's in his neck. His neck 
has a chip implanted into it.

54:23.045 --> 54:25.480
"Loser Man Type" is written on the chip.

54:25.915 --> 54:27.026
A chip?

54:27.049 --> 54:31.496
In order to control the people, 
the Amanto need to avoid uprisings.

54:31.520 --> 54:33.097
And so they did research
on making these chips.

54:33.122 --> 54:34.500
How do I explain this?

54:34.523 --> 54:38.903
This kind of chip weakens
a person's will to fight.

54:38.928 --> 54:43.275
As long as it's embedded in the spine,
which is connected to the brain,

54:43.299 --> 54:45.028
it can cause a person to lose 
their fighting spirit.

54:45.334 --> 54:47.011
You're saying they used to do this?

54:47.036 --> 54:48.380
- They stopped doing it. 
- Why?

54:48.404 --> 54:50.916
How should I say this?

54:50.940 --> 54:53.352
It's because there's too many people.

54:53.376 --> 54:57.370
They can't make enough chips
for the whole nation.

54:57.546 --> 55:00.958
It's too many!
Everyone... is too much!

55:00.983 --> 55:04.496
A lot! Everyone is too much! Too many!

55:04.520 --> 55:09.067
They were talking about making enough
for the Joui faction, 

55:09.091 --> 55:12.288
but in that case, wouldn't it 
be faster to just kill them all?

55:12.495 --> 55:15.307
It would be faster that way.
Killing them would be.

55:15.331 --> 55:20.312
Then, everybody went, "Oh..."

55:20.336 --> 55:23.182
Wouldn't it be faster? "Oh..."

55:23.205 --> 55:27.685
And then, everyone just went, "Oh..."
And then they had a calm conversation.

55:27.710 --> 55:29.555
We got it.

55:29.578 --> 55:35.394
Hey, hey. I heard that several chips have been stolen
from the research room from my Bunshin friend.

55:35.418 --> 55:37.352
Way to go, Bunshin-aru!

55:37.653 --> 55:41.232
That's just like when Lupin was young 
and he invaded the castle of the powerful Riostro!

55:41.257 --> 55:45.136
And then he stole the goat bill and shot him 
with a whistle! Wasn't it because he saved Claris?!

55:45.160 --> 55:46.525
Yeah, yeah... Yeah.

55:48.497 --> 55:49.692
What is this guy saying?

55:50.000 --> 55:52.111
Right? He needs to shut up, right?

55:52.134 --> 55:54.512
Hurry and get rid of his chip.

55:54.537 --> 55:56.048
No way, no way!

55:56.072 --> 55:59.284
Even doctors with more advanced
skills than me can't do it!

55:59.308 --> 56:01.120
I mean the chip is stuck to his spine.

56:01.143 --> 56:05.022
Pulling it out might damage
his nearby nerves.

56:05.047 --> 56:08.142
Not even the best doctor
can do it. No way, no way.

56:09.285 --> 56:12.030
- I can. 
- He can.

56:12.030 --> 56:15.267
Eh? But aren't you expensive?
How much do you charge?

56:15.291 --> 56:17.623
- 200 million yen.
- He said 200 million yen.

56:18.294 --> 56:19.504
Do you have that?

56:19.528 --> 56:20.472
No.

56:20.496 --> 56:23.363
- Then, it's a no-go, huh? 
- He said a no-go.

56:29.005 --> 56:30.549
Isn't he the guy that does 
forensics in Aibou?

56:30.573 --> 56:32.451
Uh...

56:32.475 --> 56:33.685
Isn't there anything you can do?

56:33.709 --> 56:36.144
A way to fix this stupid chip.

56:38.214 --> 56:42.082
Then... I guess we have
no choice, but to do that.

56:46.389 --> 56:50.035
Itou... Itou wants to kill Kondo-san.

56:50.059 --> 56:51.770
I need to notify the Vice Commander
as soon as possible! 

56:51.794 --> 56:53.284
Otherwise, the Vice Commander will be in danger!

56:56.499 --> 56:59.093
You are...

57:05.408 --> 57:08.343
It's impossible.
I can't.

57:08.644 --> 57:10.289
I'm a loser.

57:10.312 --> 57:13.524
This guy is no good.
We need to change the pilot.

57:13.549 --> 57:15.745
You need to go, Toushi!

57:16.118 --> 57:18.212
The future of mankind is in your hands!

57:19.121 --> 57:23.422
No... I'm scared.
I want to run away.

57:24.160 --> 57:26.151
Why does it have to be me?!

57:26.695 --> 57:29.630
I don't think he can do it-aru.
Call someone else-aru.

57:30.699 --> 57:34.567
Hey, Hakase! Don't let him 
pilot that. Let me do it!

57:36.605 --> 57:38.630
Toushi... you really can't do it?

57:39.241 --> 57:42.653
It's not impossible! 
He can do it!

57:42.678 --> 57:45.147
Don't forget that he used to be called 
the Demon Vice Commander.

57:45.681 --> 57:48.794
My dog is more of a demon than he is!

57:48.818 --> 57:51.263
Toushi, switch with me.

57:51.287 --> 57:54.848
Toushi! Are you going to stay a coward forever?!

57:55.257 --> 57:56.734
Hurry up and attack!

57:56.759 --> 57:59.228
I don't know how to attack!

58:03.866 --> 58:06.845
I want to run away!
I can't do this!

58:06.869 --> 58:09.682
Toushi! Don't give up!

58:09.705 --> 58:11.783
He's a complete loser-aru.

58:11.807 --> 58:13.318
It's better for him to die.

58:13.342 --> 58:15.586
You loser!

58:15.611 --> 58:18.444
Even if you provoke me,
there's nothing I can do.

58:18.681 --> 58:21.343
I'm afraid of fighting.

58:22.184 --> 58:25.313
I want to go home and watch Anime!

58:34.897 --> 58:38.110
This chip is way too powerful after all.

58:38.134 --> 58:40.865
This level of stimulation
doesn't work, huh?

58:41.504 --> 58:44.371
This was originally the best way 
to cure someone from being a loser.

58:44.473 --> 58:47.408
This is absolutely ******* irritating.

58:48.310 --> 58:50.210
Eh? He's smoking?!

58:50.713 --> 58:53.425
Does that mean Hijikata-san is back?

58:53.449 --> 58:56.461
Alright! The old man's treatment worked-aru!

58:56.485 --> 58:58.817
No, I know this myself.

59:00.189 --> 59:01.554
This is my last cigarette.

59:07.663 --> 59:10.598
This is the end of Hijikata Toushiro.

59:21.610 --> 59:26.448
My personality will be completely taken over
by the chip in a few minutes.

59:29.952 --> 59:32.444
My time limit is up.

59:33.756 --> 59:34.917
Well, whatever.

59:38.727 --> 59:42.857
This is the last smoke. Whether 
it's made from rice straw or wood.

59:44.867 --> 59:46.545
Listen up.

59:46.569 --> 59:49.436
There's no time.
I'll only say it once.

59:51.807 --> 59:54.469
This is my first
and final request for you guys.

59:58.948 --> 01:00:00.211
Please...

01:00:01.951 --> 01:00:05.819
protect...

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:14.785
our Shinsengumi!

01:00:17.366 --> 01:00:20.879
You are the legendary swordsman...

01:00:20.903 --> 01:00:23.381
Kawakami Bansai.

01:00:23.405 --> 01:00:27.419
Did the "Thousand Bansai" people
actually exist?

01:00:27.443 --> 01:00:28.954
I am now...

01:00:28.978 --> 01:00:32.557
Kiheitai's Bansai.

01:00:32.581 --> 01:00:33.776
Kiheitai?

01:00:42.558 --> 01:00:44.424
Itou...

01:00:44.693 --> 01:00:48.857
Do you have a secret connection to the Kiheitai?

01:00:49.498 --> 01:00:53.594
Yamazaki-kun. Fighting and killing
won't change the world.

01:00:53.969 --> 01:00:57.564
We need to be on good terms with each other.

01:00:58.507 --> 01:01:02.375
I balance the interests of both parties
and maintain the peace.

01:01:03.045 --> 01:01:05.500
The way your commander does things

01:01:05.514 --> 01:01:07.846
won't make the Shinsengumi stronger.

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:11.748
I'm going to give the Shinsengumi a rebirth.

01:01:12.621 --> 01:01:16.455
I'll make us stronger and bigger.

01:01:17.059 --> 01:01:21.690
And then I'll become the ark
that this world needs.

01:01:22.464 --> 01:01:24.296
You're just doing what you want.

01:01:26.735 --> 01:01:31.048
I don't know how far you'll get though.

01:01:31.073 --> 01:01:35.943
The Bushido way doesn't accept
empty shells of men.

01:01:36.645 --> 01:01:38.374
No one will follow you.

01:01:39.581 --> 01:01:40.742
I will...

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:44.520
follow those guys...

01:01:45.054 --> 01:01:47.666
to the very end.

01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:51.627
Are you going to try 
and get to Hijikata until you die?

01:01:51.927 --> 01:01:54.988
Is that your so-called "Bushido way?"

01:01:56.865 --> 01:01:58.856
I'll leave this to you, Bansai-dono.

01:02:02.805 --> 01:02:07.402
I'll give you guys the honor
of defeating the Joui faction.

01:02:08.811 --> 01:02:13.681
Good for you guys. You will be able to implement
this "Bushido way" that you love so much.

01:02:14.616 --> 01:02:17.415
I will make sure to tell
your supervisors for you.

01:02:18.954 --> 01:02:20.820
No, I guess there's no need.

01:02:21.924 --> 01:02:24.859
They will be joining you soon after all.

01:02:27.896 --> 01:02:30.490
What's happening in the Shinsengumi?

01:02:30.766 --> 01:02:32.511
He was implanted with a strange chip,

01:02:32.534 --> 01:02:34.445
then expelled from the Shinsengumi.

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:35.733
Who knows.

01:02:36.138 --> 01:02:40.452
Whatever is happening in the Shinsengumi,
it has nothing to do with us.

01:02:40.476 --> 01:02:41.486
It's better not to get involved too deeply.

01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:44.956
But Hijikata-san begged us to help.

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:47.800
Even though he has so much pride,

01:02:47.883 --> 01:02:56.868
Hijikata-san humbled himself and asked
for help, so it must be pretty serious.

01:02:56.892 --> 01:02:59.953
Um... Sakatashi...

01:03:01.663 --> 01:03:07.845
Today, there's a sale of a rare
limited edition Love Punk figure,

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:09.981
but each person can only buy one.

01:03:10.005 --> 01:03:12.200
But I want one for a collection...

01:03:12.775 --> 01:03:16.803
one to look at...

01:03:17.613 --> 01:03:21.140
and one to play with.
So that will add up to three.

01:03:22.718 --> 01:03:27.487
And so I have a very important
request for you guys!

01:03:30.459 --> 01:03:33.839
You just stirred up our emotions with your 
humbling request a while ago, didn't you?!

01:03:33.862 --> 01:03:36.607
Where did your shame go?!

01:03:36.632 --> 01:03:39.077
You just listed three ways 
on how to play with your dolls!

01:03:39.101 --> 01:03:40.178
You big pervert-aru!

01:03:40.202 --> 01:03:42.569
I was a fool for worrying about you!

01:03:45.207 --> 01:03:46.518
Vice Commander!

01:03:46.542 --> 01:03:47.819
There's an emergency, Vice Commander!

01:03:47.843 --> 01:03:49.788
Please come back to headquarters at once!

01:03:49.812 --> 01:03:52.023
- What happened? 
- Yamazaki-san...

01:03:52.047 --> 01:03:54.025
He was killed by an unknown person!

01:03:54.049 --> 01:03:55.527
Yamazaki-san was killed?!

01:03:55.551 --> 01:03:56.795
We haven't found the murderer yet.

01:03:56.819 --> 01:03:59.197
Anyways, please come back to us right now.

01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:01.099
But I was fired.

01:04:01.123 --> 01:04:04.136
No one cares about that! 
Come on, hurry up!

01:04:04.159 --> 01:04:06.000
Go to where Yamazaki is.

01:04:07.229 --> 01:04:08.856
Fly up!

01:04:09.031 --> 01:04:11.209
Ow, it hurts, Sakatashi!

01:04:11.233 --> 01:04:14.112
You're pulling my clothes
along with my skin!

01:04:14.136 --> 01:04:16.715
It's like a Gundam just dropped
a huge bomb on me!

01:04:16.738 --> 01:04:19.049
My hands and heads are breaking!

01:04:19.074 --> 01:04:21.839
Shut up! You need to shut the hell up!

01:04:23.545 --> 01:04:26.056
What's going on?!

01:04:26.081 --> 01:04:29.676
Why is the Shinsengumi
trying to kill Hijikata-san?!

01:04:48.003 --> 01:04:52.150
Holy moly!
Kagurashi is amazing!

01:04:52.174 --> 01:04:54.986
She's like a replica of the machine doll.

01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:57.088
Shut up!

01:04:57.112 --> 01:04:59.206
Who's going to shut him up?!

01:05:20.002 --> 01:05:23.615
This is the 3rd squad reporting.
Please answer.

01:05:23.639 --> 01:05:25.116
Have you found Hijikata?

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:26.151
Yes, we did.

01:05:26.174 --> 01:05:30.300
But he had a super, super cute assistant
that we couldn't defeat-aru!

01:05:30.312 --> 01:05:31.541
Aru?

01:05:32.147 --> 01:05:34.025
Kill him anyway, no matter what!

01:05:34.049 --> 01:05:36.728
If Hijikita is around, 
killing Kondo won't mean anything.

01:05:36.752 --> 01:05:38.763
In other words,
before we kill Kondo,

01:05:38.787 --> 01:05:40.232
we have to eliminate
any potential rebellion.

01:05:40.255 --> 01:05:41.999
As long as Kondo and Hijikata are dead,

01:05:42.024 --> 01:05:45.103
then the Shinsengumi
will be loyal to Itou Kamotarou.

01:05:45.127 --> 01:05:47.672
He's going to assassinate
Kondo-san and Hijikata-san?

01:05:47.696 --> 01:05:50.842
Remember to blame it on blasphemy.

01:05:50.866 --> 01:05:53.311
If this plan is exposed at this delicate stage,

01:05:53.335 --> 01:05:56.047
the Shinsengumi will be divided in two.

01:05:56.071 --> 01:05:59.939
Kondo is scheduled to board a train
arranged by Itou-san.

01:06:08.183 --> 01:06:10.345
Which train is it?

01:06:10.786 --> 01:06:12.880
Weren't you guys listening?!

01:06:13.055 --> 01:06:16.668
Chief Matsudaira took the Shogun
to the Hakone hot springs.

01:06:16.692 --> 01:06:17.869
We were told to guard them.

01:06:17.893 --> 01:06:19.604
The Shogun again?!

01:06:19.628 --> 01:06:21.206
It's a lie, of course!

01:06:21.229 --> 01:06:24.241
Kondo was tricked into coming like a fool.

01:06:24.266 --> 01:06:27.312
All the members on the train
are all loyal to Itou-san.

01:06:27.336 --> 01:06:29.080
He's all alone.

01:06:29.104 --> 01:06:32.130
Kondo is destined to fall
into the pits of hell.

01:06:32.808 --> 01:06:35.675
This train will pass through Bushuu, right?

01:06:36.244 --> 01:06:40.725
It's the hometown where I
grew up with Sougo and Toushi.

01:06:40.749 --> 01:06:44.242
That was the place
where we got into constant fights.

01:06:45.787 --> 01:06:49.382
It still hasn't changed
now that I think about it.

01:06:50.659 --> 01:06:52.127
Sometimes I feel anxious.

01:06:52.928 --> 01:06:57.263
I'm not sure if I've gotten 
more mature over the years.

01:06:58.667 --> 01:07:01.659
Have I made any progress or growth?

01:07:02.671 --> 01:07:04.833
You are an excellent samurai.

01:07:05.941 --> 01:07:09.202
I've never seen anyone as honest as you.

01:07:09.778 --> 01:07:11.974
I wonder if we will become good friends...

01:07:13.415 --> 01:07:15.315
You're flawless and have
a pure white innocence.

01:07:15.851 --> 01:07:19.219
You can accept anything
and be dyed in any color.

01:07:20.222 --> 01:07:21.800
I think that everyone in the Shinsengumi

01:07:21.823 --> 01:07:25.070
needs to be layed out on a white cloth

01:07:25.093 --> 01:07:27.892
and start spreading their own colors
until they form one big picture.

01:07:29.431 --> 01:07:32.799
If I compare myself to you,
my color is black.

01:07:34.002 --> 01:07:36.047
I can't become any color.

01:07:36.071 --> 01:07:38.267
On the contrary,
I will blacken everything.

01:07:39.841 --> 01:07:41.104
I'm sorry, Kondo-san.

01:07:43.045 --> 01:07:47.778
Your Shinsengumi
has been dyed all black.

01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:04.932
Sensei, you're really good! 
You say some funny stuff!

01:08:05.167 --> 01:08:07.932
Are we all dyed in black?

01:08:08.236 --> 01:08:13.170
I see. I guess it is true
that we are pretty white.

01:08:13.341 --> 01:08:16.332
But... I wonder...

01:08:16.944 --> 01:08:19.437
if I'm just dyed black
because I have a lot of body hair.

01:08:20.916 --> 01:08:26.877
We are painting our colors on a white cloth?

01:08:27.756 --> 01:08:30.849
They're not as naive as you think.

01:08:31.426 --> 01:08:34.953
I don't know about the men around you, 
but they aren't like that.

01:08:35.397 --> 01:08:38.924
I don't think you could call them white.

01:08:40.234 --> 01:08:41.430
They are red.

01:08:42.370 --> 01:08:44.481
It's a red that keeps burning
and stains everything.

01:08:44.506 --> 01:08:46.837
They are persistent and won't
be stolen by anything new.

01:08:47.776 --> 01:08:51.899
In the end, they're bothersome
with their attachment.

01:08:51.947 --> 01:08:55.281
It's quite nerve-racking.

01:08:57.085 --> 01:08:58.500
But you know what, Sensei?

01:08:59.453 --> 01:09:01.000
Even if you gather up a bunch of dirt,  

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.899
it'll eventually become something 
visible as the years go by.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:08.126
Before I knew it,
we became a wonderful team.

01:09:09.231 --> 01:09:12.359
They don't have an education or idealogy.

01:09:13.001 --> 01:09:15.368
They're a group
who act before they think.

01:09:16.872 --> 01:09:20.464
I have no idea what goes on in their heads.

01:09:22.511 --> 01:09:23.376
Sensei.

01:09:25.212 --> 01:09:27.011
You can't control them.

01:09:30.218 --> 01:09:32.948
They won't be dyed in any other color.

01:09:34.221 --> 01:09:36.189
Nor will they be tainted by anything!

01:09:41.897 --> 01:09:43.200
Okita-kun, what are you doing?

01:09:43.932 --> 01:09:45.366
You should be guarding the entrance.

01:09:46.434 --> 01:09:48.528
What the hell are you doing, you bastard?

01:09:50.906 --> 01:09:53.966
I asked what the hell are you doing,
you shitty asshole.

01:09:56.845 --> 01:09:57.835
Let him go.

01:09:58.146 --> 01:09:59.389
Okita-kun.

01:09:59.414 --> 01:10:01.212
Why are you talking to Itou-sensei like that?

01:10:03.518 --> 01:10:06.431
I said to take your hands off of him!

01:10:06.454 --> 01:10:07.580
Sougo...

01:10:09.257 --> 01:10:10.349
Okita-kun.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:15.353
You're on Hijikata's side after all.

01:10:17.966 --> 01:10:21.231
You got close to me and acted
as a spy to monitor my movements.

01:10:21.603 --> 01:10:26.202
Betraying Hijikata was all part of your act too?

01:10:26.341 --> 01:10:28.002
It wasn't an act.

01:10:28.944 --> 01:10:30.275
I told you.

01:10:30.612 --> 01:10:34.480
I just want to be the Vice Commander 
of the Shinsengumi and that's it.

01:10:35.383 --> 01:10:37.909
Whoever dares to stand in my way,
I will get rid of them.

01:10:39.254 --> 01:10:40.619
Hijikata is gone.

01:10:41.456 --> 01:10:42.548
Next...

01:10:46.061 --> 01:10:48.120
It's your turn, of course, Itou-sensei.

01:10:49.064 --> 01:10:52.625
I won't be controlled by you or Hijikata.

01:10:53.869 --> 01:10:56.030
I only have one person I'm loyal to.

01:10:58.106 --> 01:11:00.006
Give him to me!

01:11:00.942 --> 01:11:02.341
Being next to Kondo...

01:11:03.912 --> 01:11:05.038
That's my seat!

01:11:08.383 --> 01:11:10.613
You're a real work of art.

01:11:13.255 --> 01:11:16.568
You used me to get rid of Hijikata.

01:11:16.591 --> 01:11:18.992
And after you did that,
you were going to get rid of me?

01:11:20.428 --> 01:11:22.897
That chip cost me a lot of money.

01:11:23.198 --> 01:11:27.362
It looks like you're going
to have to pay for it.

01:11:27.569 --> 01:11:30.534
It's not a price I can pay for, right?

01:11:32.007 --> 01:11:33.202
It's fine.

01:11:34.142 --> 01:11:37.009
My goal is to become the Chief of Shinsengumi.

01:11:55.330 --> 01:11:59.198
Kondo-san... At this rate,
he's going to be killed.

01:11:59.467 --> 01:12:00.696
Hijikata-san!

01:12:01.703 --> 01:12:04.138
Get a hold of yourself, Hijikata-san!

01:12:04.472 --> 01:12:07.117
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:12:07.142 --> 01:12:11.079
If you continue like this, someone special 
to you and even your special team...

01:12:11.279 --> 01:12:13.390
All of it might vanish!

01:12:13.415 --> 01:12:15.281
Gin-chan, what are we going to do?

01:12:18.987 --> 01:12:23.520
Please protect... our Shinsengumi.

01:12:26.494 --> 01:12:30.556
Kagura. Connect the radio to all 
the patrols and headquarters.

01:12:31.099 --> 01:12:32.191
Yes, sir!

01:12:36.237 --> 01:12:39.450
Hello? Can you hear me?

01:12:39.474 --> 01:12:41.451
You tax thieves.

01:12:41.476 --> 01:12:44.042
Whether you're an Itou
or a bottle of mayonnaise, who cares.

01:12:44.045 --> 01:12:46.139
All of you tax thieves
need to listen to me.

01:12:46.481 --> 01:12:49.600
Go after the train
that Kondo is on right away.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.154
Otherwise, your commander's head
might just come off.

01:12:54.255 --> 01:12:56.000
This is an order to all of you!

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.461
Otherwise, all of you should commit seppuku
for lacking the Bushido spirit.

01:13:02.297 --> 01:13:04.800
Are you kidding me?!
Who the hell are you?!

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.500
You bastard, you better 
watch your mouth. Who am I?

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.248
I'm the Vice Commander
of the Shinsengumi,

01:13:10.271 --> 01:13:13.400
Hijikata Toushiro, you little shit!

01:13:18.079 --> 01:13:20.207
I can't stand your stupidity anymore.

01:13:21.216 --> 01:13:22.560
This is perfect.

01:13:22.584 --> 01:13:26.316
If the Shinsengumi are going to be wiped out, 
then you might as well disappear too.

01:13:27.088 --> 01:13:28.532
I'll take you all to your graves.

01:13:28.556 --> 01:13:31.526
This isn't a joke.
I'm not going.

01:13:37.699 --> 01:13:39.543
Don't just do what you want

01:13:39.566 --> 01:13:42.503
and throw all of your troubles
on other people!

01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:45.248
Are you the kind of man
who asks others for help?

01:13:45.273 --> 01:13:46.500
Are you the kind of man 

01:13:46.509 --> 01:13:49.353
who pushes the responsibility 
of the Shinsengumi on others?

01:13:49.377 --> 01:13:55.077
Like hell you are. If you really want to die, 
then you need to die beside your comrades.

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:58.500
That's what the real Hijikata Toushiro would do!

01:14:02.624 --> 01:14:04.300
That hurts.

01:14:06.728 --> 01:14:10.000
I said that hurts, you bastard!

01:14:11.599 --> 01:14:13.123
Could it be...

01:14:13.735 --> 01:14:15.379
Hijikata-san?!

01:14:15.403 --> 01:14:16.547
Itou-sensei!

01:14:16.571 --> 01:14:19.283
The explosion area is in flames!
It's dangerous to stay here any longer!

01:14:19.307 --> 01:14:20.706
Don't stop the train!

01:14:22.277 --> 01:14:24.336
If we stop this train, 
then Kondo will escape.

01:14:25.413 --> 01:14:27.680
Those two only have each other.

01:14:27.682 --> 01:14:29.393
And this train is full of our men only.

01:14:29.417 --> 01:14:33.600
As long as the train continues, 
then it's a game of cat and mouse.

01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:38.235
I'm sorry, Sougo. 

01:14:38.259 --> 01:14:40.455
All of this happened because of me.

01:14:41.129 --> 01:14:44.099
How can I apologize to you?!

01:14:44.632 --> 01:14:46.726
How am I going to apologize
to you and Toushi?!

01:14:52.173 --> 01:14:53.732
Sougo, what are you doing?!
Open the door!

01:14:54.576 --> 01:14:55.737
Kondo-san.

01:14:56.744 --> 01:14:59.441
If the commander is killed,
then we're defeated.

01:14:59.714 --> 01:15:01.526
Stay here and avoid that.

01:15:01.549 --> 01:15:03.506
Don't give me that bullshit
and open the door!

01:15:04.686 --> 01:15:05.744
Kondo-san.

01:15:06.788 --> 01:15:09.400
I already told you, didn't I?

01:15:09.424 --> 01:15:12.450
Your only flaw is that
you trust people too much.

01:15:13.161 --> 01:15:16.140
You trust anyone
without a second thought.

01:15:16.164 --> 01:15:21.201
In the end, you even got
swindled by that sly fox.

01:15:22.337 --> 01:15:26.137
Well... I thought something 
like this was bound to happen.

01:15:28.543 --> 01:15:30.722
What are you doing?! 
Hey! Stop! Sougo!

01:15:30.745 --> 01:15:33.146
Don't!
Sougo!

01:15:34.182 --> 01:15:35.172
Hey!

01:15:35.783 --> 01:15:41.187
But... because of you,
we formed a team.

01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:44.302
Because of you...

01:15:44.325 --> 01:15:46.494
we fought side by side.

01:15:46.494 --> 01:15:49.500
I'm willing to give up my life...

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.492
in order to protect you.

01:15:55.403 --> 01:15:56.370
Sougo!

01:15:56.738 --> 01:16:00.641
If you die, I... I...

01:16:00.909 --> 01:16:03.810
Sougo!

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:06.800
Itou-sensei! 

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.248
One of the train compartments was separated!

01:16:09.384 --> 01:16:11.629
Start up the power
for the rear compartment.

01:16:11.653 --> 01:16:13.314
Don't let Kondo escape.

01:16:15.223 --> 01:16:15.781
Yes, sir.

01:16:21.462 --> 01:16:22.600
Okita-kun.

01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:26.232
I thought you were smarter than this.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.500
Are you planning on fighting
all of us by yourself?

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.700
You let Kondo escape alone 
and stayed behind to die by enemy hands.

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.834
Do you want be a hero
and tragically sacrifice yourself?

01:16:36.377 --> 01:16:39.400
But... that's too bad.

01:16:39.414 --> 01:16:41.906
Kondo will die just like I planned.

01:16:42.684 --> 01:16:46.314
We're not the only ones
on this battlefield.

01:16:51.659 --> 01:16:52.990
Is it the Kiheitai?

01:16:55.363 --> 01:16:56.728
Sorry, Itou-san.

01:16:57.232 --> 01:16:58.757
Actually, I'm not alone either.

01:17:02.804 --> 01:17:03.999
Who is that?

01:17:07.842 --> 01:17:09.701
That's...

01:17:09.711 --> 01:17:12.100
Impossible.
That's...

01:17:13.381 --> 01:17:16.282
Time for an official business inspection-aru!

01:17:17.552 --> 01:17:21.580
Did you think we'd be waiting
for our hands to get tied?!

01:17:23.825 --> 01:17:26.294
Hijikata!

01:17:27.295 --> 01:17:28.795
How could he be here?

01:17:30.798 --> 01:17:34.511
That hurt! I'm scared!

01:17:34.535 --> 01:17:35.866
You bastard!

01:17:36.404 --> 01:17:39.465
Can you act cool for just a little bit?

01:17:39.974 --> 01:17:41.886
I wanted you to act cool
in front of your comrades!

01:17:41.909 --> 01:17:45.200
If the Vice Commander is still alive,
then it will boost morale!

01:17:45.713 --> 01:17:50.500
When you hit me earlier,
I thought you went back to normal!

01:17:50.505 --> 01:17:51.746
It's impossible!

01:17:52.787 --> 01:17:54.983
I'm not capable of doing this kind of thing!

01:17:56.424 --> 01:17:59.052
Sakatashi! I'll leave it to you!

01:17:59.861 --> 01:18:02.359
Those eyesores are catching up to us.

01:18:03.031 --> 01:18:04.328
However...

01:18:04.866 --> 01:18:07.665
an army won't be enough to destroy them.

01:18:09.637 --> 01:18:10.866
Hijikata-kun...

01:18:11.839 --> 01:18:13.967
What exactly can he do against us?

01:18:15.843 --> 01:18:19.900
I'll going to... eliminate all of you.

01:18:19.981 --> 01:18:21.972
You're the one
who's going to get eliminated.

01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:24.400
I can somewhat see it on your faces.

01:18:24.452 --> 01:18:27.820
But are you guys really prepared to die?

01:18:28.489 --> 01:18:31.754
Article 21 of the Shinsengumi law states...

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.986
"Anyone who conspires
with the enemy must be punished."

01:18:36.564 --> 01:18:38.498
I will...

01:18:42.737 --> 01:18:44.102
take care of all of you.

01:18:46.841 --> 01:18:49.887
Can't you see your situation clearly?

01:18:49.911 --> 01:18:52.642
I'm the one with the upper hand right now.

01:18:52.947 --> 01:18:56.713
And you are the only rebel.

01:18:56.951 --> 01:19:01.600
The rules laid down by Hijikata 
have no meaning anymore.

01:19:01.622 --> 01:19:05.115
Your Shinsengumi is going to disappear now.

01:19:10.698 --> 01:19:14.066
Get rid of him.
I'm going after Kondo.

01:19:17.705 --> 01:19:20.583
I'm the 1st Division Captain
of the Shinsengumi.

01:19:20.608 --> 01:19:23.035
I'll teach you guys one last thing.

01:19:23.778 --> 01:19:27.737
When you are cornered
and overwhelmed by great strength...

01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:31.949
the best way to bridge
that gap of strength is...

01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:34.151
to control your breathing...

01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:37.988
calm the inside of your body...

01:19:38.693 --> 01:19:41.526
and then wait for the best opportunity.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.000
Attack me all together!

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.024
And then...

01:19:57.478 --> 01:19:59.105
Make a reservation in hell.

01:20:01.783 --> 01:20:03.080
Bansai.

01:20:03.918 --> 01:20:06.148
It's almost time.

01:20:07.054 --> 01:20:08.852
I know.

01:20:13.728 --> 01:20:15.127
It's going just as planned.

01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:18.189
Edo's security is wide open.

01:20:18.966 --> 01:20:20.832
Itou Kamotarou...

01:20:22.136 --> 01:20:24.547
He's a pretty capable man, isn't he?

01:20:24.572 --> 01:20:26.199
This is a great opportunity.

01:20:30.812 --> 01:20:34.009
Go and get rid of... the Shogun.

01:20:46.093 --> 01:20:51.128
The traitor is coming out to die!

01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:03.734
Shinpachi!

01:21:19.193 --> 01:21:21.890
Would you like to go to 
a different hostess club today?

01:21:22.897 --> 01:21:23.887
Katakuriko.

01:21:24.732 --> 01:21:27.900
Other than the hostess club, is there any other 
nightlife place that's fun in Edo?

01:21:27.902 --> 01:21:28.960
No!

01:21:30.905 --> 01:21:34.000
Hey, hey.
The road is blocked off.

01:21:34.842 --> 01:21:36.936
We can't go to the hostess club like this.

01:21:37.845 --> 01:21:39.779
Hey, driver, stop right here.

01:21:51.826 --> 01:21:53.300
Oh my, what do we have here?

01:21:53.861 --> 01:21:57.229
Aren't you guys from the Bansai river?

01:21:57.865 --> 01:22:01.802
Get out of the way,
or I'll arrest you.

01:22:14.815 --> 01:22:16.613
You bastard...

01:22:18.119 --> 01:22:19.678
Why are you...

01:22:21.222 --> 01:22:24.214
Why are you in a place like this?

01:22:24.859 --> 01:22:27.726
I heartlessly expelled you...

01:22:28.095 --> 01:22:30.792
But you came here for my sake...

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.700
Toushi!

01:22:35.202 --> 01:22:37.068
Why did you come here?

01:22:37.338 --> 01:22:39.204
You dumbass!

01:22:40.074 --> 01:22:42.672
Eh?
Terrible!

01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:48.649
Kondo-san, are you okay?

01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:52.107
Oh no. There's a dead gorilla
lying on the floor.

01:22:53.321 --> 01:22:55.789
What the hell are you guys doing?!

01:22:56.057 --> 01:22:58.659
There he is.
Are you all right?

01:22:58.659 --> 01:23:01.500
I heard that you were almost assassinated.

01:23:01.502 --> 01:23:04.288
I was almost assassinated by you
a few seconds ago!

01:23:05.099 --> 01:23:08.262
Anyway... why are you guys
together with Toushi?

01:23:08.703 --> 01:23:11.797
It's strange that you guys
would come to help me.

01:23:12.907 --> 01:23:13.931
Those were his last words.

01:23:14.375 --> 01:23:15.672
Last words?

01:23:16.043 --> 01:23:19.347
His soul was taken by a brain-altering chip.

01:23:19.347 --> 01:23:21.679
Right now he's just a loser Otaku.

01:23:22.116 --> 01:23:24.209
And he can't be restored.

01:23:24.986 --> 01:23:27.648
A chip that alters the human brain?

01:23:28.656 --> 01:23:33.389
Hey... What did Toushi 
ask you guys to do in that state?

01:23:34.161 --> 01:23:36.891
He told us to protect the Shinsengumi.

01:23:37.398 --> 01:23:40.890
Since it's too much of a pain in the ass, 
I just brought him over to you to fix.

01:23:41.302 --> 01:23:43.804
Our job is finished.

01:23:43.804 --> 01:23:45.640
We'll be taking a fat paycheck now.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.005
Yorozuya.

01:23:48.376 --> 01:23:50.139
I have a request for you guys as well.

01:23:52.113 --> 01:23:54.300
This can also be regarded as my last words.

01:23:55.003 --> 01:23:57.316
Eh? Didn't you hear the paycheck part?

01:23:59.353 --> 01:24:02.720
Take Toushi and get out of here.

01:24:04.158 --> 01:24:07.252
All of this is my responsibility.

01:24:08.362 --> 01:24:12.355
I don't want to get Toushi
involved in this battle.

01:24:13.067 --> 01:24:17.905
I ignored his warning
when he told me to be weary of Itou.

01:24:17.905 --> 01:24:20.908
And even though he made only minor mistakes,

01:24:20.908 --> 01:24:23.240
I agreed to expel him.

01:24:25.179 --> 01:24:26.271
Toushi...

01:24:28.015 --> 01:24:32.111
Something happened to him
that I didn't know about.

01:24:33.888 --> 01:24:36.118
I didn't even know that he was...

01:24:38.025 --> 01:24:40.994
so bent on protecting the Shinsengumi.

01:24:42.163 --> 01:24:45.826
He has a lot of pride...

01:24:46.233 --> 01:24:47.962
but he bowed down his head to you guys.

01:24:49.804 --> 01:24:52.432
He entrusted the Shinsengumi to you guys.

01:24:56.210 --> 01:24:57.939
I'm sorry, Toushi...

01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:01.475
I'm sorry, everyone...

01:25:03.451 --> 01:25:04.475
I... 

01:25:06.887 --> 01:25:09.754
I'm a huge idiot.

01:25:13.027 --> 01:25:17.123
Please notify all the vehicles 
to leave the battlefield immediately.

01:25:18.199 --> 01:25:20.759
Kondo Isao has died in battle.

01:25:22.002 --> 01:25:26.803
I don't want my companions
to continue killing each other.

01:25:34.215 --> 01:25:35.773
Everyone on the Yamato squad!

01:25:36.383 --> 01:25:40.285
Our Commander, Kondo Isao,
has been rescued safely!

01:25:40.788 --> 01:25:42.449
Victory belongs to us!

01:25:43.057 --> 01:25:47.828
Those who humiliate the Commander is an enemy!

01:25:47.828 --> 01:25:50.956
They're scum!

01:25:51.398 --> 01:25:55.309
I'm going to punish you
in the name of the moon!

01:25:58.839 --> 01:26:01.899
Who is this?!
Who is asking us to do this?!

01:26:02.042 --> 01:26:03.407
Who am I?

01:26:03.844 --> 01:26:06.500
I'm the Shinsengumi's Vice Commander,

01:26:06.547 --> 01:26:09.914
Hijikata Toushiro!

01:26:10.184 --> 01:26:11.819
Hijikata-san?

01:26:11.819 --> 01:26:12.547
Kondoshi.

01:26:14.088 --> 01:26:16.454
I'm going to put my life in your hands!

01:26:17.458 --> 01:26:20.393
In return, you have an obligation to me!

01:26:22.062 --> 01:26:23.188
That is...

01:26:25.332 --> 01:26:26.959
you can't die.

01:26:28.335 --> 01:26:30.565
No matter what happens,
you have to live!

01:26:31.038 --> 01:26:33.574
No matter how humiliated you are!

01:26:33.574 --> 01:26:36.975
No matter how many comrades
you have to sacrifice!

01:26:37.845 --> 01:26:39.836
You have to live!

01:26:40.848 --> 01:26:44.045
As long as you exist,
the Shinsengumi will not disappear.

01:26:58.532 --> 01:26:59.897
Kondo-san.

01:27:00.601 --> 01:27:04.037
You are the soul of the Shinsengumi.

01:27:04.839 --> 01:27:07.500
We are protecting you as your sword.

01:27:08.242 --> 01:27:09.436
Toushi...

01:27:13.047 --> 01:27:16.039
How can a broken sword protect someone?

01:27:16.917 --> 01:27:21.013
I spent a lot of money
to turn you into a useless loser.

01:27:21.622 --> 01:27:25.559
Since it looks like you have overcome it,
I guess I have no other option but to destroy you.

01:27:25.559 --> 01:27:27.254
You bastard.

01:27:28.395 --> 01:27:30.631
So you made me like this?

01:27:30.631 --> 01:27:33.930
Now then, pull out your sword if you can!

01:27:35.202 --> 01:27:36.464
Hijikata-san!

01:27:37.104 --> 01:27:42.974
There are things that even an Otaku can do
when they need to! Please show him!

01:27:55.923 --> 01:27:57.447
Pull out the sword, you little shit!

01:28:01.028 --> 01:28:05.032
It's getting dark. Why are you playing around?
Hurry up and draw your sword!

01:28:05.032 --> 01:28:06.567
Shut the hell up!

01:28:06.567 --> 01:28:09.536
I'll do it!
I'll draw my sword!

01:28:10.271 --> 01:28:13.672
This is the world's biggest Genkidama!
(Genkidama: spirit bomb in Dragonball Z)

01:28:14.441 --> 01:28:17.140
Give me strength!

01:28:30.958 --> 01:28:32.220
Yorozuya!

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.188
What is it?

01:28:34.328 --> 01:28:38.465
I heard your shitty preaching
loud and clear!

01:28:38.465 --> 01:28:41.696
You're acting all high and mighty!

01:28:42.469 --> 01:28:44.937
Let me tell you something, you bastard!

01:28:46.273 --> 01:28:49.576
Thank you!

01:28:49.576 --> 01:28:53.113
Hey, are you Toushi again?

01:28:53.113 --> 01:28:55.343
Are you the real Toushi now?

01:28:57.251 --> 01:28:58.240
I...

01:28:59.553 --> 01:29:03.683
I am Hijikata Toushiro!

01:29:05.059 --> 01:29:10.258
If you want to get Kondo, 
you'll have to go through me first!

01:29:10.631 --> 01:29:14.301
I won't let anyone get across!

01:29:14.301 --> 01:29:16.462
Nobody is getting across!

01:29:16.670 --> 01:29:19.537
You won't defile our soul!

01:29:20.341 --> 01:29:24.402
I'm the only one who's going
to protect Kondo Isao!

01:29:24.712 --> 01:29:27.348
I am the Shinsengumi's Vice Commander,

01:29:27.348 --> 01:29:30.749
Hijikata Toushiro!

01:29:31.518 --> 01:29:33.153
Bring it on!

01:29:33.153 --> 01:29:35.713
The time for our victory has come!

01:29:43.063 --> 01:29:48.592
You've got some guts challenging me, 
the Chief of the Shinsengumi.

01:29:49.003 --> 01:29:50.766
I admire your courage.

01:29:51.372 --> 01:29:52.669
However...

01:29:53.307 --> 01:29:59.268
As soon as I give an order,
the Shinsengumi will come.

01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:04.778
Oh, wrong side.

01:30:08.722 --> 01:30:11.156
Calling to the Shinsengumi.

01:30:11.458 --> 01:30:14.695
I took Shou-chan out to have some fun,

01:30:14.695 --> 01:30:17.425
but we're surrounded by the Kiheitai.

01:30:18.799 --> 01:30:21.290
Please dispatch someone immediately.

01:30:22.536 --> 01:30:27.132
Okay. The siren will ring very soon.

01:30:40.154 --> 01:30:41.314
Or not.

01:30:41.588 --> 01:30:44.785
The Shinsengumi went to Hakone
to soak in the hot springs.

01:30:45.692 --> 01:30:48.320
Is that right?

01:30:50.731 --> 01:30:54.827
Then, I'll have to deal with you personally.

01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:07.500
Can you move a little more to the middle?
A little more to the middle.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
You're too serious!
Smile more!

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:13.800
Here I go!

01:31:14.555 --> 01:31:16.580
Alright, say cheese!

01:31:21.695 --> 01:31:22.855
Okey dokey!

01:31:25.766 --> 01:31:27.358
Time to switch.

01:31:36.643 --> 01:31:39.476
I'm sorry for getting you
into something troublesome.

01:31:39.813 --> 01:31:45.183
It's always risky for men to come out
and play with some fire.

01:31:45.452 --> 01:31:47.818
Running away is pointless.

01:32:18.719 --> 01:32:19.845
You guys...

01:32:20.754 --> 01:32:22.722
are very well-trained
in order to get this far...

01:32:23.457 --> 01:32:24.856
I'm getting fired up.

01:32:34.568 --> 01:32:35.830
Hey, hey...

01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:39.337
This is not a place for women 
and children to play at.

01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:42.543
Look who's talking.

01:32:42.543 --> 01:32:44.636
You must not be anything special
after getting tired at this level.

01:32:48.749 --> 01:32:53.379
I don't plan on being sweet
or grateful to you guys.

01:32:55.622 --> 01:32:58.887
Well, we can get your wounds treated
at the Hakone hot springs.

01:32:59.493 --> 01:33:01.188
I didn't ask you to do that.

01:33:01.762 --> 01:33:03.286
Attack!

01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:55.548
That was dangerous!

01:34:24.478 --> 01:34:27.314
I'm surrounded by the Kiheitai.

01:34:27.314 --> 01:34:29.509
Mobilize immediately!

01:34:31.018 --> 01:34:33.854
Gin-san... the Shogun, he's...

01:34:33.854 --> 01:34:37.457
Yeah...
Is that how it's like?

01:34:37.457 --> 01:34:38.959
That bastard, Takasugi...

01:34:38.959 --> 01:34:41.895
Gin-san, Edo...
and the Shogun are in danger!

01:34:41.895 --> 01:34:44.831
But you know, you know... Do we have 
an obligation to protect the Shogun?

01:34:44.831 --> 01:34:45.830
If they kill the Shogun, 

01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:47.834
then Takasugi Shinsuke 
will start killing people!

01:34:47.834 --> 01:34:50.500
Even if you tell me that...

01:34:50.537 --> 01:34:52.027
[Long wait.]

01:34:52.973 --> 01:34:54.408
Katsura Kotaro!

01:34:54.408 --> 01:34:58.312
Gintoki. I didn't really have 
any intention in helping the Shinsengumi,

01:34:58.312 --> 01:35:00.814
but I can't ignore the Kiheitai.

01:35:00.814 --> 01:35:01.746
Let me help you.

01:35:02.849 --> 01:35:05.886
Takasugi intends to destroy Edo.

01:35:05.886 --> 01:35:07.454
Hey, Elizabeth!

01:35:07.454 --> 01:35:09.589
I'm about to say some cool lines!

01:35:09.589 --> 01:35:11.887
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

01:35:12.092 --> 01:35:14.695
We'll leave the Shinsengumi to Katsura-san.

01:35:14.695 --> 01:35:15.962
We need to head back to Edo!

01:35:15.962 --> 01:35:20.867
It's far, we can't go back there that fast.
This place is out in the countryside.

01:35:20.867 --> 01:35:23.028
Ginnoji!

01:35:23.937 --> 01:35:26.840
Ginnoji!
Get on this!

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:29.104
We'll be able to get to Edo in no time!

01:35:35.015 --> 01:35:38.051
Ginnoji!

01:35:38.051 --> 01:35:41.418
Ginnoji!
Get on this thing!

01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:43.757
[Hakuto]

01:35:43.757 --> 01:35:44.925
[To Edo City]

01:35:44.925 --> 01:35:47.928
Hey... are you sure that thing is safe?

01:35:47.928 --> 01:35:51.131
What do you mean?
It's just a raccoon. Look at it.

01:35:51.131 --> 01:35:53.633
And it's washing apples, man.

01:35:53.633 --> 01:35:57.604
This time, I've cleverly avoided paying a fee.

01:35:57.604 --> 01:36:00.941
Quickly! Let's go to where 
Mei-chan is right away!

01:36:00.941 --> 01:36:02.499
He said Mei-chan.

01:36:02.876 --> 01:36:05.712
The next door *****.

01:36:05.712 --> 01:36:07.145
This isn't good!

01:36:07.748 --> 01:36:09.978
Not on that side too!

01:36:23.063 --> 01:36:23.927
This is...

01:36:41.615 --> 01:36:43.800
I ended up having to put out
a little more effort than I thought.

01:36:45.118 --> 01:36:47.400
Will I get paid overtime?

01:36:47.454 --> 01:36:48.785
Sougo!

01:37:12.479 --> 01:37:13.912
Welcome!

01:37:16.049 --> 01:37:20.543
I heard that a bunch of fellows
wanted to assassinate the Shogun.

01:37:21.521 --> 01:37:23.223
In order to lure them out,

01:37:23.223 --> 01:37:25.691
I took the Shogun out everywhere.

01:37:26.493 --> 01:37:28.300
Thank you for throwing yourself into the net.

01:37:28.995 --> 01:37:33.597
Are you okay with being in Edo City 
without the Shinsengumi?

01:37:33.867 --> 01:37:37.971
I heard that the Commander was kidnapped.

01:37:37.971 --> 01:37:40.132
They did a pretty good job.

01:37:40.774 --> 01:37:43.910
But if the Commander is killed,

01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:46.600
then it's like a dragon
without its head, isn't it?

01:37:47.781 --> 01:37:52.081
You deserve a lot of praise.

01:37:56.656 --> 01:38:00.148
My boss told me
to assassinate the Shogun.

01:38:01.228 --> 01:38:03.788
Even if I have to kill other people...

01:38:04.598 --> 01:38:06.691
I will bring back the Shogun's head.

01:38:06.833 --> 01:38:10.826
That's to be expected of the Bansai people.

01:38:11.872 --> 01:38:13.203
Come and show us what you got!

01:38:30.690 --> 01:38:31.588
Oh...

01:38:32.626 --> 01:38:33.991
How interesting.

01:41:09.082 --> 01:41:12.052
I didn't expect the inside 
of Edo City to be this different.

01:41:12.052 --> 01:41:14.350
It's directly connected to the Amanto building.

01:41:14.754 --> 01:41:17.120
You guys are helpless puppets, huh?

01:41:17.724 --> 01:41:23.094
Alright, your last opponent
is this old man here.

01:41:29.402 --> 01:41:30.403
Come on!

01:41:30.403 --> 01:41:34.305
You should mourn for the loss 
of the old Shogunate more than this. 

01:41:35.475 --> 01:41:38.250
You should be able to go to hell peacefully.

01:41:39.245 --> 01:41:41.770
Bring it on!

01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:49.189
I don't know how strong you are,

01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:51.291
but this old man is not your opponent.

01:41:51.291 --> 01:41:52.826
Here, take this back.

01:41:52.826 --> 01:41:55.462
Huh? Isn't this our uniform?

01:41:55.462 --> 01:42:02.061
Your men entrusted me
with a ton of work.

01:42:03.837 --> 01:42:08.500
Enter the amount of the reward on here.
I need it to pay for my rent.

01:42:11.377 --> 01:42:12.946
You can clearly see that, can't you?

01:42:12.946 --> 01:42:14.814
No, I'm an old flower.

01:42:14.814 --> 01:42:16.100
You can see it.

01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:17.517
I wrote it very big.

01:42:17.517 --> 01:42:19.075
Let me see.

01:42:19.319 --> 01:42:24.924
I used to have 2.0 vision...
when I was young.

01:42:24.924 --> 01:42:26.050
Huh?

01:42:26.426 --> 01:42:29.529
Young man, you look like
that girl at the hostess club.

01:42:29.529 --> 01:42:30.864
You've got the wrong person.

01:42:30.864 --> 01:42:32.525
- And the guy at the barber shop...
- You're totally mistaken!

01:42:33.032 --> 01:42:36.763
Move. I'll take care of this guy.

01:42:37.137 --> 01:42:41.875
Don't be so serious.
He's just a substitute.

01:42:41.875 --> 01:42:42.807
That's what I thought.

01:42:43.143 --> 01:42:46.045
If the Chief of the Shinsengumi 
takes the real Shogun around with him,

01:42:46.045 --> 01:42:47.213
then he should be fired.

01:42:47.213 --> 01:42:48.942
The real one is here.

01:42:51.151 --> 01:42:53.483
This is the feed from the Hakone hot springs.

01:42:55.155 --> 01:42:59.220
So that means that the real one
actually did escape to Hakone.

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.425
You really do have a good backbone.

01:43:02.996 --> 01:43:04.190
I wonder about that.

01:43:05.198 --> 01:43:08.001
I wanted to change my image.

01:43:08.001 --> 01:43:10.300
It was the real you that day, wasn't it?!

01:43:10.336 --> 01:43:14.204
Shigeshige's Secret Onsen Tour.

01:43:14.474 --> 01:43:17.875
The name of the hot spring is 
"Miyagami's Onsen."

01:43:18.378 --> 01:43:20.573
The onsen here is open air...

01:43:21.414 --> 01:43:23.575
Sorry, young man.
I'll turn it off first.

01:43:24.384 --> 01:43:26.511
Alright, let's go to the hostess club.

01:43:27.253 --> 01:43:28.345
Thank you.

01:43:28.855 --> 01:43:29.856
You're going to the hostess club again?

01:43:29.856 --> 01:43:31.500
How about going to a bar today?

01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:34.127
Hey, you're going to the hostess club
in this situation?

01:43:34.127 --> 01:43:35.321
Hey!

01:43:38.364 --> 01:43:41.492
You... You're one of Takasugi's men, right?

01:43:42.268 --> 01:43:44.532
My rhythm and tempo is out of sync now.

01:43:48.041 --> 01:43:50.168
I give up on assassinating the Shogun.

01:43:51.377 --> 01:43:55.181
But... I can't let you go back alive.

01:43:55.181 --> 01:43:58.446
Hey! Take off the headphones
when people are talking to you!

01:43:59.485 --> 01:44:03.148
Who taught you such manners?
You march to the beat of your own drum.

01:44:04.157 --> 01:44:06.022
Sakata Gintoki.

01:44:06.492 --> 01:44:09.188
No... "White Demon."

01:44:10.196 --> 01:44:12.932
Why did you join the Shinsengumi?

01:44:12.932 --> 01:44:14.490
Can you hear me, you bastard?!

01:44:15.101 --> 01:44:20.970
Why are you working together
with that Itou guy from the Shinsengumi?

01:44:21.341 --> 01:44:24.333
You even tried to assassinate the Shogun.

01:44:24.978 --> 01:44:26.502
What do you guys really want?

01:44:26.946 --> 01:44:32.145
We are not partners with the renegade.

01:44:32.452 --> 01:44:35.700
And we know full well when people violate 
benevolence and righteousness.

01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:37.500
No one is willing to follow them.

01:44:37.523 --> 01:44:38.649
Then...

01:44:39.959 --> 01:44:45.659
are you using Itou and the Shinsengumi
as tools in order to control Edo?

01:44:46.332 --> 01:44:48.664
He's quite the poor fellow.

01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:52.638
But it's too late to stop him now.

01:44:53.573 --> 01:44:56.007
He is destined to die
with the Shinsengumi.

01:44:56.676 --> 01:45:01.670
What have you guys done?

01:45:13.426 --> 01:45:17.997
Those guys won't die by your traps.

01:45:17.997 --> 01:45:20.591
I sure hope you're right.

01:45:32.979 --> 01:45:35.447
A genius is always lonely.

01:45:36.382 --> 01:45:38.350
Nobody can understand me.

01:45:38.584 --> 01:45:41.485
I'm not going to give in to the men here.

01:45:42.622 --> 01:45:44.624
Nobody knows me.

01:45:44.624 --> 01:45:47.650
Nobody has ever found my true value.

01:45:48.728 --> 01:45:51.000
In that case...

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.157
I'll have to show my ability to the world.

01:45:55.969 --> 01:45:58.504
I have to take the Shinsengumi as my own.

01:45:58.504 --> 01:46:01.268
I want to build it myself
and control the world.

01:46:03.042 --> 01:46:06.307
I'll engrave the existence
of Itou Kamotarou...

01:46:07.447 --> 01:46:11.178
into everyone's hearts.

01:46:12.418 --> 01:46:14.716
Is it okay to be that notorious?

01:46:16.089 --> 01:46:21.322
For you to do that, don't you need
to favor him in order to kill him?

01:46:24.130 --> 01:46:25.188
Favor him?

01:46:26.232 --> 01:46:28.496
I should have favored Kondo quite a bit.

01:46:29.402 --> 01:46:33.634
I'm willing to be under that incompetent 
commander in order to use him later.

01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:38.342
He thanked me. I don't remember him
ever complaining about me.

01:46:44.517 --> 01:46:46.144
Itou.

01:46:47.453 --> 01:46:51.321
Do you think that everyone
is an idiot except you?

01:46:52.625 --> 01:46:56.561
Are you upset that those fools
don't understand you?

01:46:58.564 --> 01:47:01.089
Do you want to show your true abilities?

01:47:02.502 --> 01:47:04.663
Don't take yourself too seriously.

01:47:06.205 --> 01:47:07.729
You are just...

01:47:13.646 --> 01:47:15.807
one person.

01:47:18.217 --> 01:47:22.119
I know what you're really after.

01:47:38.237 --> 01:47:39.602
Hijikata...

01:47:42.175 --> 01:47:44.405
I see...

01:47:45.178 --> 01:47:47.146
I won.

01:47:52.518 --> 01:47:55.783
I finally beat Hijikata!

01:48:16.509 --> 01:48:18.204
Does Itou...

01:48:18.511 --> 01:48:22.448
Does he know you used him
to assassinate the Shogun?

01:48:22.448 --> 01:48:25.151
There's no way that he would.

01:48:25.151 --> 01:48:28.211
His goal is to be the commander
of the Shogunate.

01:48:28.554 --> 01:48:32.149
We took advantage of his pride and vanity.

01:48:32.658 --> 01:48:35.261
You guys are pretty vile.

01:48:35.261 --> 01:48:37.456
That kind of death
is very suitable for him.

01:48:37.797 --> 01:48:41.557
A traiter should die from betrayal.

01:48:54.347 --> 01:48:55.279
Don't...

01:48:57.650 --> 01:48:59.174
Stop!

01:49:00.186 --> 01:49:01.175
No!

01:49:08.761 --> 01:49:10.363
Stop!

01:49:10.363 --> 01:49:12.923
I'm not someone who should die
in a place like this!

01:49:13.833 --> 01:49:17.496
Stop... I still have a lot to do.

01:49:17.904 --> 01:49:20.439
I can do more... more...

01:49:20.439 --> 01:49:21.599
Mother!

01:49:22.308 --> 01:49:25.444
Look! I got full marks in school!

01:49:25.444 --> 01:49:28.436
Kamotarou, please be quiet.

01:49:28.948 --> 01:49:31.348
Your brother is sick right now.

01:49:34.487 --> 01:49:36.422
I'm sorry.

01:49:36.422 --> 01:49:39.225
I need to work harder, do a lot better.

01:49:39.225 --> 01:49:42.194
If I work harder,
they will surely acknowledge me.

01:49:43.829 --> 01:49:45.831
Don't be so arrogant!

01:49:45.831 --> 01:49:49.289
You're an idiot!

01:49:49.702 --> 01:49:52.432
We hate you the most!

01:49:57.843 --> 01:50:00.937
If I work harder and harder...

01:50:01.414 --> 01:50:04.679
I will get everyone's approval.

01:50:07.553 --> 01:50:08.821
One point!

01:50:08.821 --> 01:50:10.254
Well done!

01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:12.391
Kamo, you are doing great!

01:50:12.391 --> 01:50:14.961
At such a young age,
you already have great swordsmanship!

01:50:14.961 --> 01:50:16.758
You must have worked hard.

01:50:17.997 --> 01:50:20.693
Kamo! Go to Edo!

01:50:21.267 --> 01:50:24.566
I'll recommend you into a famous dojo!

01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:29.000
Why?

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.800
[Letter of Recommendation]
I wonder why the younger twin brother 

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:33.500
Kamotarou is so healthy?

01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:37.783
No matter how talented Takahashi is,
he just can't stand up to him.

01:50:37.783 --> 01:50:41.685
Kamotarou has stolen everything
from Takahashi for a long time.

01:50:42.855 --> 01:50:46.325
It must be when Kamotarou
was in my stomach,

01:50:46.325 --> 01:50:49.294
he took away everything from Takahashi.

01:50:49.595 --> 01:50:52.865
That kind of child
shouldn't be born at all.

01:50:52.865 --> 01:50:56.392
Hey! What are you going to do
if Kamotarou heard you?

01:50:56.769 --> 01:50:58.361
That was too harsh.

01:50:58.671 --> 01:51:01.834
Why? Why won't people acknowledge me?

01:51:02.308 --> 01:51:05.744
Please don't leave me alone.

01:51:07.947 --> 01:51:09.915
Please be by my side.

01:51:11.017 --> 01:51:12.450
Please hold my hand.

01:51:17.690 --> 01:51:18.588
Kondo.

01:51:19.558 --> 01:51:20.957
What are you doing?

01:51:22.862 --> 01:51:28.027
What are you doing right now?
Do you even understand?

01:51:29.935 --> 01:51:33.871
I tried to kill you.
I'm a traitor.

01:51:44.083 --> 01:51:47.353
You being killed will bother me
as the commander.

01:51:47.353 --> 01:51:49.889
An incompetent commander
will let his soldiers die.

01:51:49.889 --> 01:51:52.449
So it's not a sin if you try to kill
the incompetent commander.

01:51:53.059 --> 01:51:58.725
I'm sorry that I'm not worthy
of being your commander.

01:51:59.732 --> 01:52:01.666
Sorry, Sensei.

01:52:02.435 --> 01:52:06.565
I'm not... just only
your brother-in-arms.

01:52:07.106 --> 01:52:10.940
I also want you to be
one of my drinking buddies...

01:52:11.944 --> 01:52:14.811
One of my good friends!
That's what you wanted, right?

01:52:15.414 --> 01:52:18.850
There's a lot more 
I want to talk to you about!

01:52:19.585 --> 01:52:20.984
Sensei!

01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:23.451
What I wanted the most...

01:52:28.761 --> 01:52:33.824
I've tried so hard...
I haven't made any mistakes yet.

01:52:35.401 --> 01:52:37.028
Please look at me more.

01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:40.737
Please praise me more.

01:52:43.476 --> 01:52:47.437
I didn't want status or reputation.

01:52:47.847 --> 01:52:50.441
Even if nobody understands me...

01:52:51.450 --> 01:52:53.714
What are you doing?!

01:52:56.756 --> 01:52:58.781
What I really wanted was...

01:53:11.504 --> 01:53:14.166
already there in front of me.

01:53:15.775 --> 01:53:18.010
I wanted...

01:53:18.010 --> 01:53:19.478
Sensei!

01:53:19.478 --> 01:53:21.412
All I wanted was friendship.

01:53:27.019 --> 01:53:29.544
Sensei!

01:53:45.171 --> 01:53:46.763
Hijikata-kun.

01:53:47.807 --> 01:53:50.139
I have one thing I want to tell you.

01:53:50.943 --> 01:53:53.844
What a coincidence.
Me too.

01:53:54.513 --> 01:53:56.037
I hate you.

01:53:56.549 --> 01:53:58.176
I hate you too.

01:53:58.918 --> 01:54:00.486
I'll kill you one day.

01:54:00.486 --> 01:54:01.145
So...

01:54:01.821 --> 01:54:04.187
you can't die here!

01:54:52.238 --> 01:54:54.604
As expected of the White Demon.

01:54:56.108 --> 01:54:59.845
Even someone from Bansai
can't kill you easily.

01:54:59.845 --> 01:55:02.279
Don't get the wrong idea.

01:55:03.048 --> 01:55:05.500
It's not easy to kill someone who's weak.

01:55:07.119 --> 01:55:08.746
Let's get going.

01:55:09.822 --> 01:55:12.958
I have to go get rid of
all your little traps.

01:55:12.958 --> 01:55:14.550
I need to hurry up and find them.

01:55:15.928 --> 01:55:18.055
It's too late for that.

01:55:18.531 --> 01:55:20.931
Well... I wonder about that.

01:55:22.134 --> 01:55:22.896
Get down!

01:55:42.087 --> 01:55:43.155
Sensei!

01:55:43.155 --> 01:55:44.986
Itou... Itou!

01:55:46.125 --> 01:55:48.616
Sensei! Sensei!

01:55:57.803 --> 01:55:59.896
What are you stunned about?

01:56:00.773 --> 01:56:04.265
Vice Commander.
What's your order?

01:56:05.010 --> 01:56:08.571
As you can see, the enemy 
no longer has a leader.

01:56:09.081 --> 01:56:10.844
It's time to counterattack.

01:58:02.361 --> 01:58:04.158
Come on, White Demon.

01:58:04.463 --> 01:58:06.988
Let me drag you down to hell 
with this helicopter.

01:58:07.266 --> 01:58:10.702
Don't screw with me!

01:58:11.070 --> 01:58:12.970
White Demon!

01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:18.277
Why on earth do you fight?!

01:58:18.277 --> 01:58:21.146
What do you risk your life for?!

01:58:21.146 --> 01:58:24.479
The Samurai's path to destruction
is a downhill slope!

01:58:25.017 --> 01:58:27.753
Even if you don't assist them,

01:58:27.753 --> 01:58:30.119
sooner or later,
this country will perish!

01:58:30.889 --> 01:58:34.293
It's impossible for you
to stop it by yourself!

01:58:34.293 --> 01:58:38.059
This country has long lost
the value of protection!

01:58:38.397 --> 01:58:43.802
This country has been swallowed up
by the Amanto and everyone is corrupt!

01:58:43.802 --> 01:58:47.294
The Samurai have stopped trying
to rebuild this country!

01:58:47.506 --> 01:58:50.475
This country needs its belly cut open!

01:58:57.182 --> 01:59:03.348
If you want to die... 
then just kill yourself.

01:59:04.089 --> 01:59:05.488
Sakata Gintoki.

01:59:05.958 --> 01:59:08.051
You're a dead man.

01:59:08.827 --> 01:59:11.497
You used to protect
the kingdom of Samurai.

01:59:11.497 --> 01:59:14.057
You used to fight side by side
with Shinsuke and Katsura.

01:59:14.366 --> 01:59:18.166
You can't let go of your persistence.
It controls you.

01:59:18.504 --> 01:59:20.369
You're just a living undead.

01:59:21.039 --> 01:59:24.167
What you wanted to protect is long gone!

01:59:24.376 --> 01:59:29.143
The undead should go back
to where they came from!

01:59:38.957 --> 01:59:41.255
This string has the strength of steel.

01:59:42.027 --> 01:59:46.198
I advise you not to pull too hard
or it will break your hands and feet.

01:59:46.198 --> 01:59:47.062
Shoot!

01:59:49.468 --> 01:59:54.030
Take that crap off your ears and listen up!

01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:55.564
I'm...

01:59:56.175 --> 02:00:00.479
not fighting for this third-rate country.

02:00:00.479 --> 02:00:02.538
Not even once!

02:00:03.549 --> 02:00:08.554
If this country perishes...
or the Samurai dies off...

02:00:08.554 --> 02:00:11.352
I don't give a damn!

02:00:23.202 --> 02:00:29.141
From the past till now...
the thing I want to protect...

02:00:32.911 --> 02:00:35.038
The one thing I want to protect...

02:00:46.458 --> 02:00:50.394
has never changed!

02:00:59.238 --> 02:01:00.398
Damn it all.

02:01:04.176 --> 02:01:07.373
This kind of friendship exists, huh?

02:01:10.182 --> 02:01:12.047
I never knew...

02:01:15.921 --> 02:01:19.448
When I realized it, it was too late.

02:01:23.328 --> 02:01:26.889
It's not easy to find
such precious friendship.

02:01:29.568 --> 02:01:32.093
When I found it, I destroyed it.

02:01:39.411 --> 02:01:42.107
Will you give him to me?

02:01:44.249 --> 02:01:48.117
Please...
This person is already...

02:01:48.987 --> 02:01:50.352
Yorozuya.

02:01:51.390 --> 02:01:54.450
You helped us out a lot this time.

02:01:56.528 --> 02:01:59.588
But we won't be able to fulfull this request.

02:02:00.532 --> 02:02:04.298
Imagine how many people Itou has killed.

02:02:05.037 --> 02:02:07.973
We have to take care of the traitors.

02:02:07.973 --> 02:02:10.237
Hey, what are you saying?

02:02:12.411 --> 02:02:13.673
Kondo-san.

02:02:24.222 --> 02:02:27.521
Don't worry, he's already dying.

02:02:29.394 --> 02:02:31.089
That's why...

02:02:32.197 --> 02:02:36.327
That's why... they need to kill him.

02:02:44.209 --> 02:02:45.642
Stand up, Itou!

02:02:46.745 --> 02:02:48.736
Let's decide this with a duel.

02:02:49.181 --> 02:02:50.239
Those guys...

02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:55.015
They don't want him to die...

02:02:56.021 --> 02:02:57.750
as a traitor.

02:03:29.454 --> 02:03:30.716
In the end...

02:03:32.424 --> 02:03:36.684
he will die as a comrade
and a warrior.

02:03:37.796 --> 02:03:40.287
They want him to die
fighting with a companion.

02:03:41.166 --> 02:03:43.760
Itou!

02:03:44.403 --> 02:03:47.531
Hijikata!

02:04:44.362 --> 02:04:48.423
Thank you.

02:05:31.610 --> 02:05:35.706
The Shogunate is unexpectedly tenacious.

02:05:37.282 --> 02:05:38.306
No...

02:05:39.317 --> 02:05:42.309
Was Itou too vulnerable, or maybe...

02:05:43.421 --> 02:05:47.357
Bansai, were you too weak?

02:05:47.626 --> 02:05:50.424
I was interrupted halfway
when I was about to kill him.

02:05:50.929 --> 02:05:52.829
If I wasn't interrupted by him...

02:05:53.532 --> 02:05:57.169
The most important thing 
is the rhythm and the prelude.

02:05:57.169 --> 02:05:59.865
I don't think I did anything wrong.

02:06:00.539 --> 02:06:03.940
Because if you are missing one 
of those, then it can't be done.

02:06:07.712 --> 02:06:08.872
Bansai.

02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:14.716
Don't you want to listen to my song?

02:06:15.754 --> 02:06:16.812
No.

02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:23.728
Their song is the cause of my defeat.

02:06:23.728 --> 02:06:25.753
It was quite fascinating.

02:06:51.656 --> 02:06:55.427
Eh?! This is bad!

02:06:55.427 --> 02:06:58.624
They totally think I'm dead.

02:07:00.498 --> 02:07:01.897
I changed my mind.

02:07:02.467 --> 02:07:05.561
I want to hear your song again.

02:07:06.738 --> 02:07:08.540
You have to keep on living.

02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:11.300
I'm looking forward to the day that 
you let me hear some more fun songs.

02:07:13.612 --> 02:07:15.513
So nobody knew...

02:07:15.513 --> 02:07:18.004
that I was still alive.

02:07:19.551 --> 02:07:20.916
This is bad...

02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:28.262
I'm sorry!
I'm still alive.

02:07:30.262 --> 02:07:31.500
If I say that, 

02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:35.825
then the misunderstanding
will be cleared...

02:07:36.635 --> 02:07:39.331
What should I do?

02:07:39.871 --> 02:07:42.704
But I feel bad about 
how things turned out this way.

02:07:42.907 --> 02:07:46.866
I made everyone cry for me.

02:07:52.784 --> 02:07:54.586
They're sleeping!

02:07:54.586 --> 02:07:57.022
Those guys are reading 
Shonen Jump manga!

02:07:57.022 --> 02:07:59.456
He's talking on his phone!

02:08:00.759 --> 02:08:03.295
You're going to extend your suspension?

02:08:03.295 --> 02:08:07.465
Yeah. Although it was an accident,
I have a big responsibility for the team.

02:08:07.465 --> 02:08:10.001
But you're not a loser anymore, right?

02:08:10.001 --> 02:08:12.804
Hijikata-san, if you ever
want to come back here,

02:08:12.804 --> 02:08:14.294
you can come anytime!

02:08:16.341 --> 02:08:17.433
I owe you guys a lot.

02:08:18.777 --> 02:08:20.438
Where are you going?

02:08:21.413 --> 02:08:22.710
Well...

02:08:24.082 --> 02:08:26.885
I have to take full responsibility and move on.

02:08:26.885 --> 02:08:29.683
Otherwise, they will laugh at me in hell.

02:08:35.794 --> 02:08:37.455
I forgot the payment...

02:08:37.962 --> 02:08:39.698
What are you going to do?

02:08:39.698 --> 02:08:41.933
We still don't have a dime
in our bank account!

02:08:41.933 --> 02:08:43.833
That's bad. What are we 
going to do about the rent?

02:08:44.402 --> 02:08:45.900
You guys are dead meat!

02:08:45.970 --> 02:08:48.803
[Pay the rent quickly!]
Will you pay rent or not?!

02:08:49.441 --> 02:08:51.676
Oh crap!
Run away!

02:08:51.676 --> 02:08:53.769
Don't try to escape!

02:08:55.547 --> 02:09:01.383
Okay... It seems that I have to pretend 
to be a ghost to frighten everyone.

02:09:02.053 --> 02:09:03.100
You're in the way.

02:09:04.556 --> 02:09:05.887
Vice Commander!

02:09:06.124 --> 02:09:09.423
Vice Commander!

02:09:11.596 --> 02:09:14.599
Vice Commander!

02:09:14.599 --> 02:09:18.136
- Vice Commander!
- Alright, sit down!

02:09:18.136 --> 02:09:25.000
- Vice Commander!
- Sit down. 

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.046
- Vice Commander!
- Sit already.

02:09:28.046 --> 02:09:31.482
- Vice Commander!
- Sit. 

02:09:32.851 --> 02:09:36.087
Pay the rent!

02:09:36.087 --> 02:09:39.147
If you don't pay, it will triple!

02:09:40.024 --> 02:09:44.552
Don't underestimate the strength
of this old lady's feet!
