WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.709
HEY, ROSIE.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.578
IT'S ME,

00:10.678 --> 00:12.213
YOUR DAD.

00:12.313 --> 00:15.183
UM, I HAVEN'T HEARD
BACK FROM YOU YET.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.451
AND I JUST WANTED
TO CONFIRM

00:17.551 --> 00:20.521
THAT YOU'RE STILL
COMING UP NEXT WEEK.

00:20.621 --> 00:24.792
SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEEING YOU.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.927
OKAY?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.563
I LOVE YOU.
BYE.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.735
( theme music playing )

00:53.654 --> 00:56.624
- DR. WESTON?
- YES. CALL ME PAUL.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.926
- WALTER BARNETT.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.861
WHEW.

01:00.961 --> 01:03.597
I DIDN'T MISS THE ELEVATOR,
DID I?

01:03.697 --> 01:04.798
UNFORTUNATELY NOT.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.070
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

01:13.641 --> 01:16.110
IS THERE SOMEPLACE
I COULD HANG THIS?

01:16.210 --> 01:17.878
I CAN PUT IT
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.780
OH, WELL, NO.
IN HERE.

01:19.880 --> 01:23.351
OKAY.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.321
THAT'S THE TROUBLE
WITH HAVING NICE THINGS--

01:27.421 --> 01:30.224
YOU HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THEM.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.226
MY WIFE BOUGHT ME
THAT COAT.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.628
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
BOUGHT IT MYSELF--

01:34.728 --> 01:36.664
CASHMERE, ENGLISH.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.400
I SAID, "HONEY, WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH WOOL?"

01:39.500 --> 01:42.636
SHE SAID,
"YOU'RE A C.E.O., WALT.

01:42.736 --> 01:46.407
YOU'RE A C.E.O."

01:46.507 --> 01:48.976
AS IF THAT EXPLAINS
EVERYTHING.

01:49.076 --> 01:52.513
( clears throat )

02:01.021 --> 02:03.123
WE SHOULD GET STARTED.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.259
HOW DO YOU BEGIN?

02:05.359 --> 02:07.895
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT YOURSELF?

02:07.995 --> 02:10.531
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.900
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.035
AND WE'LL TAKE IT
FROM THERE.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.405
WHAT I ALREADY KNOW?
UM...

02:17.505 --> 02:19.173
I APPRECIATE
YOUR DISCRETION,

02:19.273 --> 02:21.141
BUT I'M THICK-SKINNED.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.944
IT WON'T HURT
MY FEELINGS.

02:24.044 --> 02:28.882
I WASN'T TRYING
TO BE DISCREET.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.885
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHO I AM?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.788
WELL, YOU'RE A C.E.O.
WITH A CASHMERE COAT
AND A WIFE.

02:34.888 --> 02:37.891
THAT'S ALL I KNOW
SO FAR.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.293
AND TWO BOYS.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.828
THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN--
LAUNCHED.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.664
AND A DAUGHTER.

02:46.133 --> 02:49.437
SO YOU NEVER READ
THE BUSINESS SECTION?

02:53.241 --> 02:55.209
NATALIE--
SHE'S MY YOUNGEST--

02:55.309 --> 02:57.378
SHE'S A JUNIOR
IN COLLEGE,

02:57.478 --> 03:00.281
WHENEVER I VISIT,
OR VISITED--

03:00.381 --> 03:02.283
SHE'S OVERSEAS NOW--

03:02.383 --> 03:04.051
WHENEVER I VISIT
HER COLLEGE TOWN,

03:04.151 --> 03:06.254
THERE'S THIS
COFFEE PLACE--

03:06.354 --> 03:07.888
BAGELS, MUFFINS,

03:07.988 --> 03:10.358
KIDS BEHIND THE COUNTER
WITH PIERCED EVERYTHING.

03:10.458 --> 03:13.927
AND I NOTICED
ALL THE STUDENTS
AND THE PROFESSORS--

03:14.027 --> 03:16.063
THEY ALL READ
THE ART SECTIONS,

03:16.163 --> 03:17.631
THE SPORTS, POLITICS,

03:17.731 --> 03:19.667
BUT NEVER
THE BUSINESS SECTION.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.169
THEY HAD PRISTINE COPIES
ON EVERY TABLE.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.937
THE ONLY NEWS
THAT REALLY MATTERS--

03:24.037 --> 03:26.507
AND THEY THINK
THEY'RE ABOVE IT.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.142
AND IS THAT
WHAT YOU THINK I THINK?

03:29.243 --> 03:31.211
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

03:31.312 --> 03:34.582
YOU'RE IN A DIFFERENT
LINE OF WORK.

03:41.054 --> 03:45.393
SO, TABULA RASA?
REALLY?

03:45.493 --> 03:49.229
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED ME
TO KNOW ABOUT YOU?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.465
WELL, THAT'S NOT
ME IN THE PAPERS.
THAT'S MY COMPANY,

03:51.565 --> 03:55.336
ALTHOUGH LATELY
THAT GIRL REPORTER
FROM "THE TIMES"

03:55.436 --> 03:57.170
HAS STOPPED MAKING
THAT DISTINCTION.

03:57.271 --> 04:01.241
BUT NO, THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.977
LET'S LEAVE ALL THAT
TOMMYROT OUT OF IT--

04:04.077 --> 04:06.347
A SEPARATION
OF CHURCH AND STATE.

04:06.447 --> 04:09.483
WE CAN DO THAT.
I'D JUST LIKE
TO BE CLEAR

04:09.583 --> 04:11.785
THAT IF YOU DO WANT
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR JOB,

04:11.885 --> 04:14.288
WHATEVER YOU SAY WILL BE
COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.089
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

04:16.189 --> 04:19.593
- CAN I GET THAT
IN WRITING?
- OF COURSE.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.895
OH, NO NO.
SIT.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.998
IT'S OKAY.
I TRUST YOU.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.734
YOU SHOULD
FEEL HONORED.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.969
I HAVE PEOPLE
WORKING FOR ME
WHO'VE SPENT YEARS

04:29.069 --> 04:30.671
TRYING TO EARN
MY TRUST.

04:30.771 --> 04:34.007
I IMAGINE YOUR POSITION
REQUIRES YOU TO BE
VERY WELL GUARDED.

04:34.107 --> 04:38.211
YOU'RE GETTING THAT
FROM ALL THOSE ARTICLES
YOU DIDN'T READ.

04:38.312 --> 04:41.148
I JUST KNOW
THAT YOU RUN A COMPANY,

04:41.248 --> 04:44.151
WHICH LEADS ME
TO BELIEVE

04:44.251 --> 04:45.786
THAT YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF A LOT OF PEOPLE

04:45.886 --> 04:48.789
WHO I'M SURE NEED
ALL KINDS OF THINGS
FROM YOU.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.391
ALL THE TIME.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.860
IT'S LIKE ONE
CONSTANT MEETING

04:52.960 --> 04:54.862
15 HOURS A DAY.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.297
AND SOMEHOW
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WITH THE ANSWERS.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.633
IF I EVER STOP
MAKING DECISIONS,

04:59.733 --> 05:01.402
MAKING CALLS,

05:01.502 --> 05:03.337
THE WHOLE THING
WOULD GRIND TO A HALT.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.938
WELL, I'M SURE

05:05.038 --> 05:07.274
FINDING THE TIME TO COME HERE
CAN'T HAVE BEEN EASY.

05:07.375 --> 05:11.779
SO WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO DISCUSS?

05:11.879 --> 05:14.081
FIRST OFF, IT WASN'T
MY IDEA TO COME HERE.

05:14.181 --> 05:17.785
- IT WASN'T?
- NO, IT WAS CONNIE'S--
MY WIFE.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.020
OH, AND WHAT DID SHE

05:20.120 --> 05:23.524
WANT YOU
TO TALK ABOUT?

05:23.624 --> 05:26.093
SLEEP.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.696
I HAVEN'T BEEN
SLEEPING WELL LATELY.

05:28.796 --> 05:32.199
I THINK SHE'S GETTING TIRED
OF ME TOSSING AND TURNING.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.134
I SAID, "HONEY,
IT'S A BIG HOUSE.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.736
I CAN SLEEP
IN A SEPARATE ROOM

05:35.836 --> 05:37.671
LIKE OTHER NORMAL
MARRIED COUPLES."

05:37.771 --> 05:40.574
BUT SHE LIKES TO CUDDLE.
SO HERE I AM.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.576
IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU'VE GOT

05:42.676 --> 05:45.779
A PRETTY STRONG RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR WIFE.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.581
IT DOES?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.983
MM-HMM. YOU'VE ALREADY
MENTIONED HER TWICE,

05:50.083 --> 05:52.219
BOTH TIMES REFERRING TO
HOW SHE TAKES CARE OF YOU.

05:52.319 --> 05:56.424
YOU SEEM TO APPRECIATE HER
A GREAT DEAL.

05:56.524 --> 05:59.660
WELL, LISTEN,
DON'T TELL HER THAT.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.231
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU ALREADY
FIGURED OUT ABOUT ME?

06:04.331 --> 06:06.700
YOU SAID THAT YOU
WEREN'T SLEEPING.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.570
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT THAT.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.939
FIRST OFF,
I CAN'T TAKE PILLS--

06:12.039 --> 06:15.075
SLEEPING PILLS,

06:15.175 --> 06:16.977
ANXIETY MEDS.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.446
I'VE BEEN
THAT ROUTE ALREADY.

06:18.546 --> 06:21.549
WHO WAS YOUR
PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGIST?

06:21.649 --> 06:23.884
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THAT'S ALL I NEED NOW--

06:23.984 --> 06:25.453
THE HEADLINE--

06:25.553 --> 06:28.656
"EMBATTLED C.E.O.
UNDER PSYCHIATRIC CARE."

06:28.756 --> 06:30.758
NO, I WENT
TO MY INTERNIST,

06:30.858 --> 06:32.893
HAD HIM
PUT THE PRESCRIPTIONS
IN MY WIFE'S NAME.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.162
THAT WAY THEY COULDN'T
BE TRACED TO ME.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.264
WHAT KIND
OF PRESCRIPTIONS?

06:37.364 --> 06:39.199
HE WANTED TO TRY

06:39.299 --> 06:42.369
XANAX, AMBIEN,
THAT KIND OF THING.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.638
BUT EITHER THEY DIDN'T
WORK FOR ME

06:44.738 --> 06:47.107
OR THEY MADE ME LOOPY.
AND I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

06:47.207 --> 06:50.678
I'VE GOT TO BE ABLE
TO WAKE UP ANYTIME,
AND BE ALERT.

06:50.778 --> 06:54.181
I HAVE 20,000 WORKERS,
FACTORIES AND DISTRIBUTORS

06:54.281 --> 06:57.317
ON SIX CONTINENTS,
SHAREHOLDERS.

06:57.417 --> 07:01.354
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
A BRICK'S GONNA COME FLYING
THROUGH YOUR WINDOW.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.857
"UNEASY LIES THE HEAD
THAT WEARS THE CROWN."

07:03.957 --> 07:05.926
THAT'S PAR
FOR THE COURSE,

07:06.026 --> 07:08.996
WHICH IS WHY MY DOCTOR
SUGGESTED THAT I TALK
TO SOMEBODY ABOUT--

07:09.096 --> 07:11.098
WHAT DID HE CALL IT?

07:11.198 --> 07:14.635
--AN UNDERLYING ANXIETY.

07:14.735 --> 07:19.006
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THAT COMING HERE WAS
YOUR WIFE'S IDEA.

07:19.106 --> 07:22.375
HERE'S THE POINT--

07:22.476 --> 07:25.445
I'M USED TO STRESS.
I'M USED TO CRISIS.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.280
I'VE BEEN A C.E.O.
FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.951
AND BEFORE THAT I CARRIED
MY BOSSES' WATER,
WHICH WAS WORSE.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.555
AND BEFORE THAT
I WAS IN VIETNAM.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.691
MY WHOLE LIFE, NO MATTER
WHAT THEY HIT ME WITH,

07:37.791 --> 07:40.728
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE
TO SLEEP ANYTIME, ANYWHERE

07:40.828 --> 07:42.730
FOR AS LONG
AS THEY LET ME.

07:42.830 --> 07:46.133
IF I COULD
GET IN AN HOUR'S NAP,
I WAS GOOD FOR THE NEXT 24.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.602
- ONLY AN HOUR?
- THAT'S HOW I GOT
WHERE I AM.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.938
IT WASN'T
BECAUSE I WAS SMARTER
THAN THE OTHER GUYS.

07:51.038 --> 07:54.708
IT'S BECAUSE I COULD
WORK TWICE AS HARD
TWICE AS LONG.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.277
CONNIE USED TO CALL ME
SUPERMAN.

07:57.377 --> 08:02.215
BUT NOW I'M JUST
LYING IN BED.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.285
I'M NOT SLEEPING.
I'M NOT WORKING.

08:05.385 --> 08:08.121
WHEN DID YOUR
INSOMNIA BEGIN?

08:08.221 --> 08:09.456
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE?

08:09.557 --> 08:11.358
IT JUST MIGHT GIVE ME
A CLEARER PICTURE

08:11.458 --> 08:16.930
OF ANY UNDERLYING PROBLEM
THERE MIGHT BE.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.203
DID YOU READ
THIS BOOK, "BLINK"?

08:23.303 --> 08:25.939
MALCOLM GLADWELL--
SMART GUY.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.810
HIS THESIS IS BASICALLY
THAT AN EXPERT CAN TELL

08:29.910 --> 08:31.812
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE
WHAT THE STORY IS:

08:31.912 --> 08:34.314
IS THE PAINTING REAL
OR A FORGERY?

08:34.414 --> 08:36.149
IS THE WAR
WON OR LOST?

08:36.249 --> 08:38.518
SURE.
I KNOW THE BOOK.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.520
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT THE KIND OF THERAPY

08:40.621 --> 08:44.091
THAT I PRACTICE--
IT'S NOT A QUICK FIX.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.827
IT'S A PROCESS.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.062
AND EVENTUALLY
CHANGE HAPPENS,

08:49.162 --> 08:51.565
BUT IT DOES TAKE TIME.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.934
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.069
EVEN BEING HERE,

08:56.169 --> 08:57.571
SITTING ACROSS FROM YOU,

08:57.671 --> 08:59.773
TALKING ABOUT MY FEELINGS
OR WHATEVER--

08:59.873 --> 09:02.009
THIS IS COSTING ME MONEY.
IT'S COSTING MY
COMPANY MONEY.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.211
IT'S COSTING
MY EMPLOYEES MONEY.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.946
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS,

09:06.046 --> 09:07.648
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
MOLLYCODDLE ME.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.817
YOU HAVE A LOT OF
EXPERIENCE. USE IT.

09:09.917 --> 09:14.454
TELL ME
WHAT MY PROBLEM IS
AND WHAT I NEED TO DO.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.191
IF I NEED TO PAY EXTRA
FOR MORE INTENSE SESSIONS,
THAT'S FINE.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.193
WALTER, EVERY
PATIENT'S THERAPY

09:20.293 --> 09:22.796
IS DIFFERENT.
IT DOESN'T--

09:22.896 --> 09:26.299
YEAH YEAH YEAH.
WE'RE ALL UNIQUE
SNOWFLAKES.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.236
BUT STILL, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

09:29.336 --> 09:32.505
YES, I THINK I DO.
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING IS

09:32.606 --> 09:34.374
THIS ISN'T A CASUAL MATTER
FOR YOU,

09:34.474 --> 09:37.510
THAT THE STAKES ARE
PRETTY HIGH,

09:37.611 --> 09:41.314
AND THAT BEFORE YOU INVEST
YOUR TIME IN THIS,

09:41.414 --> 09:44.718
YOU WANT TO BE SURE
THAT I REALLY CAN HELP YOU.
ALL RIGHT?

09:44.818 --> 09:47.655
SO, BLINK TEST.

09:47.755 --> 09:50.057
HELP ME.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:50.157 --> 09:53.026
LOOK, I WISH I KNEW
THE ANSWERS THAT QUICKLY.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.995
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

09:55.095 --> 09:57.397
I COULD CHARGE
A LOT MORE FOR MY TIME.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.532
THE TRUTH IS,
IF WE'RE GOING TO FIND

09:59.633 --> 10:02.135
A CLEARER PICTURE
OF WHAT'S GOING ON

10:02.235 --> 10:04.471
WITH YOUR SLEEP PROBLEM,

10:04.571 --> 10:07.107
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DIG A LITTLE DEEPER.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.677
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.611
WHAT'S GOING ON IS

10:11.712 --> 10:13.947
I NEED TO BE AT THE TOP
OF MY GAME RIGHT NOW,

10:14.047 --> 10:18.518
AND I CAN'T GET THERE
IF I'M NOT SLEEPING.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.253
I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH CLEARER

10:20.353 --> 10:24.224
A PICTURE OF THE PROBLEM
I CAN GIVE YOU.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.760
WHEN YOU CAME IN,

10:26.860 --> 10:31.598
YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING
ABOUT SOME ARTICLES

10:31.699 --> 10:34.802
THAT WERE IN THE BUSINESS
SECTION OF THE NEWSPAPER.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.536
HATCHET JOBS,
YOU MEAN.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.673
WE HAD TO RECALL
CERTAIN PRODUCTS

10:39.773 --> 10:41.909
STRICTLY
FOR PRECAUTION,

10:42.009 --> 10:45.012
BUT YOU KNOW
THE PRESS.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.114
THEY WANT TO SPIN
A SCANDAL OUT OF IT.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.849
UH-HUH.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.686
AND WHEN DID
THESE ARTICLES

10:52.786 --> 10:55.155
START TO APPEAR?
CAN YOU REMEMBER?

10:55.255 --> 10:57.124
OH, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.559
SOME EMPLOYEE
WITH AN AXE TO GRIND

10:59.659 --> 11:01.494
IS FEEDING NONSENSE

11:01.594 --> 11:04.197
TO SOME REPORTER
WHO DOESN'T KNOW
SHE'S BEING USED.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.633
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I'D LOSE SLEEP OVER.

11:06.734 --> 11:09.169
YOU DID ALSO TELL ME
THAT UNTIL RECENTLY

11:09.269 --> 11:11.638
YOU'VE NEVER LOST SLEEP
OVER ANYTHING.

11:11.739 --> 11:15.342
I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING
TO FIND OUT IS

11:15.442 --> 11:18.045
WHEN YOU THINK
THAT CHANGED.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.948
IT'S FUNNY,
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.083
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
GRADUAL.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.685
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK
IN THE MIRROR ONE MORNING

11:25.786 --> 11:28.021
AND YOU SAY, "WHEN DID
MY HAIR TURN WHITE?

11:28.121 --> 11:30.257
OR YOU GET AN EMAIL
FROM YOUR DAUGHTER

11:30.357 --> 11:32.726
HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD

11:32.826 --> 11:37.097
AND YOU THINK, "WHEN DID
MY BABY GROW UP?

11:37.197 --> 11:40.768
YOUR DAUGHTER--
NATALIE, RIGHT?

11:40.868 --> 11:45.438
YOU SAID SHE WAS SPENDING
HER JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.841
NOT LIKE THAT.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.077
MY BOYS SPENT THEIR
JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD TOO--

11:50.177 --> 11:51.912
ONE DRINKING BEER
IN MUNICH,

11:52.012 --> 11:54.948
AND THE OTHER DRINKING
CHIANTI IN TUSCANY.

11:55.048 --> 11:59.386
SHE'S NOTHING
LIKE THEM.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.790
SOMETIMES MY WIFE AND I
WILL LOOK AT HER

12:02.890 --> 12:04.057
AND WE'LL SAY
TO EACH OTHER,

12:04.157 --> 12:07.961
"WHERE DO YOU THINK
SHE CAME FROM?"

12:08.061 --> 12:09.963
SHE WASN'T EVEN
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.032
THE BOYS WERE ALREADY
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.501
WHEN CONNIE TOLD ME
SHE WAS PREGNANT,

12:14.601 --> 12:16.403
I THOUGHT,
"YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.106
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS."

12:19.206 --> 12:22.475
BUT NATALIE
WANTED TO BE HERE.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.577
SHE WAS IN A RUSH--

12:24.677 --> 12:26.546
PREMATURE,

12:26.646 --> 12:30.717
WALKED EARLY,
TALKED EARLY,

12:30.818 --> 12:33.620
SO BRIGHT,

12:33.720 --> 12:36.489
SO HAPPY.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.129
SHE CAME
A GREAT DISTANCE

12:42.229 --> 12:46.199
TO GIVE US ALL
SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.535
YOU SOUND
INCREDIBLY PROUD OF HER.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.303
I AM.

12:50.403 --> 12:54.441
AND NOW SHE'S
HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.281
SOME CLINIC IN RWANDA.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.416
MY WIFE DIDN'T
WANT HER TO GO.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.954
SHE WANTED ME TO SAY NO,
TO TALK HER OUT OF IT.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.156
BUT I TALKED TO NATALIE
AND I COULD SEE IT
IN HER EYES--

13:09.256 --> 13:11.424
THIS WAS SOMETHING
SHE HAD TO DO.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.628
SO I LET HER GO.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.898
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A MISTAKE,

13:17.998 --> 13:21.468
BUT I LET HER GO.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.303
WHEN DID SHE LEAVE?

13:23.403 --> 13:24.604
OCTOBER.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.773
AND WHEN DID YOUR
INSOMNIA BEGIN?

13:26.874 --> 13:30.810
I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T KNOW.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.681
YOU THINK THAT'S MY
UNDERLYING ANXIETY?

13:34.781 --> 13:38.518
NO, BUT I CAN IMAGINE
IF I HAD A DAUGHTER
LIVING IN RWANDA,

13:38.618 --> 13:41.554
I THINK THAT WOULD
KEEP ME UP NIGHTS.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.257
SO THAT'S YOUR
BLINK TEST--

13:44.357 --> 13:45.625
NATALIE?

13:45.725 --> 13:49.062
I'M NOT SURE THAT
IT'S THAT ONE-ON-ONE.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.898
WHY NOT?

13:50.998 --> 13:53.200
I JUST THINK
THAT THINGS MAY BE

13:53.300 --> 13:57.137
A LITTLE BIT MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.307
YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT
JUST TRYING

14:00.407 --> 14:02.542
TO GET ME IN HERE
FOR MORE SESSIONS?

14:02.642 --> 14:04.477
IF PEOPLE COULD
TREAT THEMSELVES

14:04.577 --> 14:06.813
AND DIAGNOSE THEMSELVES,
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY NEED

14:06.914 --> 14:10.250
FOR ANY KIND OF DRUGS
OR FOR THERAPISTS LIKE ME.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.954
SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO, DOC?

14:14.054 --> 14:18.658
WELL, I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.161
I DO THINK
THAT YOU ARE SUFFERING

14:21.261 --> 14:23.830
FROM SOME KIND
OF AN ANXIETY.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.499
THE ONLY WAY I KNOW
TO ALLEVIATE YOUR SYMPTOMS

14:26.599 --> 14:30.370
IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S
CAUSING THAT ANXIETY.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.605
AND THE ONLY WAY I KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT

14:32.705 --> 14:36.809
IS TO-- IS TO TALK.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.146
I TALK TO PEOPLE
ALL DAY LONG.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.314
IT DOESN'T
HELP ME SLEEP.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.351
SOMETIMES I THINK

14:44.451 --> 14:47.620
IF I COULD JUST
GET AWAY SOMEWHERE--

14:47.720 --> 14:50.223
THE COUNTRY

14:50.323 --> 14:53.126
OR MAYBE A LAKE.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.631
( chuckles )

14:58.731 --> 15:00.300
WHAT?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.069
OH, JUST
A FUNNY THOUGHT.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.837
WOULD YOU CARE
TO SHARE IT?

15:04.938 --> 15:06.406
WITH YOU?

15:06.506 --> 15:09.009
THAT'S KIND OF
WHAT HAPPENS IN HERE.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.744
I'M SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING
THAT POPS INTO MY HEAD?

15:11.844 --> 15:14.514
- WELL, YEAH.
- OKAY.

15:14.614 --> 15:18.051
I JUST THOUGHT,
"I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD."

15:19.719 --> 15:23.690
- AND THAT
STRUCK YOU AS FUNNY?
- ( phone buzzes )

15:27.760 --> 15:31.931
GOD, I WISH SOMEONE
COULD TAKE CARE
OF SOMETHING,

15:32.032 --> 15:34.334
WITHOUT ME
HAVING TO--

15:38.271 --> 15:42.642
I'M SORRY, YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT... TALKING.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.812
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING--

15:45.912 --> 15:48.381
DEVELOPING SELF-AWARENESS.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.350
SOME PEOPLE SAY

15:50.450 --> 15:53.353
THAT IT'S A MAN'S
ENTIRE LIFE'S WORK.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.756
THAT SOUNDS
PRETTY SELF-ABSORBED.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.658
NO OFFENSE.

15:58.758 --> 16:02.029
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT YOUR PATIENTS,
UNDERSTAND, NOT YOU.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.031
IT'S JUST THAT I HAVE
A THING AGAINST PEOPLE

16:04.131 --> 16:07.034
WHO THINK THE WORLD
OWES THEM A FAVOR.

16:07.134 --> 16:10.203
MY TAKE-- YOU PLAY
THE CARDS YOU'RE DEALT.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.738
YOU DO
THE BEST YOU CAN

16:11.838 --> 16:14.841
TO DO YOUR JOB,
TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.809
THAT, IN MY OPINION,

16:16.909 --> 16:19.746
IS A REAL MAN'S
LIFE'S WORK.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.422
IT GETS SO QUIET IN HERE,
DOESN'T IT?

16:29.522 --> 16:33.093
I'M NEVER USUALLY
ANYWHERE THIS QUIET,

16:33.193 --> 16:35.562
EXCEPT ON AN AIRPLANE.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.631
THAT'S WHY
I LOVE AIRPLANES--
MY FAVORITE PLACE TO BE.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.401
( phone buzzes )

16:48.108 --> 16:49.842
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

16:49.942 --> 16:52.179
NEVER.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.116
JUST NOW
YOU TALKED ABOUT

16:56.216 --> 16:59.886
HOW IMPORTANT
YOUR JOB IS

16:59.986 --> 17:03.090
AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

17:03.190 --> 17:05.425
FOR YOU TO BE DISCREET,

17:05.525 --> 17:07.427
AND THAT YOU'RE NOT
EVEN COMFORTABLE

17:07.527 --> 17:10.263
GETTING CERTAIN PRESCRIPTIONS
IN YOUR OWN NAME.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.932
ARE YOU SAYING
I SOUND PARANOID?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.601
WELL, IT MAKES ME WONDER,
WALTER--

17:14.701 --> 17:17.404
DO YOU HAVE ANYBODY
THAT YOU CAN TALK TO

17:17.504 --> 17:20.440
ABOUT THE PRESSURES
OF YOUR BUSINESS?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.375
NOT AT WORK.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.277
ANYTHING I SAY COULD BE
USED AGAINST ME.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.779
AND I DON'T LIKE
TO WORRY CONNIE.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.282
AND HOW ABOUT
YOUR CHILDREN?

17:29.382 --> 17:32.319
NO, THE BOYS DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT THEIR
OLD MAN'S PROBLEMS.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.020
THEY WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND ANYWAY.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.488
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

17:35.588 --> 17:38.825
EVERYTHING CAME
TOO EASILY FOR THEM.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.627
THEY NEVER HAD TO MAKE
THEIR OWN WAY

17:40.727 --> 17:44.197
OR FIGHT IN A WAR.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.199
THEY JUST TAKE
EVERYTHING FOR GRANTED,

17:46.299 --> 17:47.900
INCLUDING THEIR
OLD MAN.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.069
AND NATALIE?

17:50.170 --> 17:52.439
I TOLD YOU,
SHE'S DIFFERENT.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.441
HERE, I'LL GIVE YOU
AN IDEA

17:54.541 --> 17:56.743
OF WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

17:56.843 --> 18:00.480
I GOT AN INTERESTING EMAIL
FROM HER OVER THE WEEKEND.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.850
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
IT WORRIED ME A LITTLE.

18:03.950 --> 18:06.486
- WOULD YOU MIND
IF I READ IT TO YOU?
- PLEASE.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.822
- I COULD USE
YOUR EXPERT OPINION.
- SURE.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.162
"HI, DAD.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.131
OH, GOD,
RWANDA IS HARD.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.367
I'VE NEVER WORKED
SO HARD IN MY LIFE

18:20.467 --> 18:22.502
AND UNDERSTOOD
SO LITTLE.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.638
WE'VE SET UP A RAPE CLINIC
IN THE VILLAGE OF"--

18:25.738 --> 18:29.041
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO
TRY TO PRONOUNCE THAT.

18:29.142 --> 18:32.078
"THIS WOMAN CAME IN.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.013
SHE WAS DESPERATE.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.350
THEY ALL THINK
WE CAN GET THEM VISAS
BECAUSE WE'RE AMERICAN.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.119
I EXPLAINED TO HER
THAT I COULD ONLY
OFFER HER

18:40.220 --> 18:42.222
SOME EMERGENCY
CONTRACEPTION.

18:42.322 --> 18:45.458
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN ANGRY
OR DISAPPOINTED,

18:45.558 --> 18:48.961
BUT SHE JUST
STARED AT ME,

18:49.061 --> 18:51.030
MUTE, STILL,

18:51.130 --> 18:53.065
AS IF SHE WERE
FROZEN.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.502
THEN A GIRL CAME IN,

18:55.602 --> 18:57.570
EIGHT YEARS OLD,

18:57.670 --> 19:00.072
GANG-RAPED.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.275
THE DOCTORS DID
WHAT THEY COULD,

19:02.375 --> 19:04.577
BUT SHE WILL NEVER
BE THE SAME.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.680
I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING
EXHAUSTED.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.216
BY THE END OF THE DAY

19:09.316 --> 19:11.418
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS DRINK.

19:11.518 --> 19:15.154
WE HAVE NOTHING
TO OFFER THESE PEOPLE.

19:15.255 --> 19:18.458
THE YOUNG MEN
HAVE NOTHING TO DO.

19:18.558 --> 19:24.063
SOME OF THEM
ARE SO ANGRY,

19:24.163 --> 19:28.968
THEY SPIT AT US
WHEN WE PASS.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.937
THE STRANGE THING IS,

19:31.037 --> 19:33.873
I HAVE NEVER FELT
SO ALIVE.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.042
THIS IS WHAT
LIFE IS ABOUT--

19:36.142 --> 19:39.212
HELPING PEOPLE
EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY.

19:39.312 --> 19:42.749
I'M SO GRATEFUL
TO BE HERE.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.951
I LOVE YOU AND MOM.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.687
I'LL WRITE MORE
WHEN I CAN.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.822
NATALIE."

19:56.496 --> 19:58.064
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:58.164 --> 20:01.434
SHE SOUNDS LIKE
AN EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.472
I SHOULD GO
GET HER OUT, RIGHT?

20:05.572 --> 20:07.039
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
GET HER OUT?

20:07.139 --> 20:08.341
SHE IS IN SOME KIND
OF TROUBLE.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.042
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
A CRY FOR HELP.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.711
WHY DO YOU
THINK THAT?

20:11.811 --> 20:14.113
ARE YOU TELLING ME

20:14.213 --> 20:17.250
THAT IF YOU RECEIVED
AN EMAIL LIKE THAT
FROM YOUR DAUGHTER

20:17.350 --> 20:19.252
FROM SOME RAPE CLINIC
IN RWANDA,

20:19.352 --> 20:20.953
YOU WOULDN'T BE
ON THE FIRST PLANE TO AFRICA?

20:21.053 --> 20:24.491
THERE'S A FINE LINE
BETWEEN BRAVERY AND STUPIDITY.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.393
I CAN'T SIT HERE
AND WAIT

20:26.493 --> 20:28.461
FOR HER TO BE KIDNAPPED
AND DISMEMBERED.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.530
WHERE DID YOU SAY
SHE WAS STAYING?

20:30.630 --> 20:33.333
I DIDN'T.
SHE'S LIVING IN KIGALI.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.735
AND THE CLINIC'S SOMEWHERE
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.

20:35.835 --> 20:39.038
KIGALI-- THAT'S THE CAPITAL,
ISN'T IT?

20:39.138 --> 20:41.474
WHAT, YOU THINK
THAT MAKES IT SAFE?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.443
- HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN TO AFRICA?
- NO.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.978
WELL, I HAVE.
AND LET ME TELL YOU,

20:46.078 --> 20:47.614
WHAT WE CONSIDER
STABLE HERE

20:47.714 --> 20:49.382
AND WHAT THEY
CONSIDER SECURE

20:49.482 --> 20:51.384
ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT
THINGS, MY FRIEND,

20:51.484 --> 20:53.185
TWO VERY
DIFFERENT THINGS.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.288
THEY'RE TWO VERY DIFFERENT
THINGS HERE AS WELL.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.424
- COME AGAIN?
- STABILITY AND SECURITY.

20:57.524 --> 21:00.226
THEY ARE TWO
VERY DIFFERENT CONCEPTS.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.495
OKAY, FELLOW.

21:02.595 --> 21:06.232
WELL, YOUR DAUGHTER
SOUNDS VERY STABLE.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.301
FROM A PSYCHOLOGICAL
PERSPECTIVE,

21:08.401 --> 21:11.504
GIVEN THE SITUATION
THAT SHE'S IN,

21:11.604 --> 21:13.573
SHE SOUNDS
REMARKABLY HEALTHY.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.242
SHE OBVIOUSLY FEELS
VERY DEEPLY

21:16.343 --> 21:18.411
AND SHE HAS
A VERY LUCID WAY

21:18.511 --> 21:21.548
OF EXPRESSING HERSELF.
AND IT LEADS ME
TO BELIEVE

21:21.648 --> 21:24.617
THAT YOU SHOULD
JUST TRUST HER

21:24.717 --> 21:27.887
AND TRUST HER
TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.289
- AS FOR HER SECURITY--
- UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN THERE,

21:30.390 --> 21:33.860
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.628
DO YOU HAVE
A DAUGHTER?

21:35.728 --> 21:37.730
IF YOU'RE ASKING ME
IF I'D BE WORRIED,

21:37.830 --> 21:39.298
IF I HAD A DAUGHTER
IN KIGALI--

21:39.399 --> 21:41.067
YES, I HAVE TO SAY
THAT I WOULD BE.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.402
AND YOU WOULDN'T GO
AND GET HER OUT?

21:42.502 --> 21:44.270
I CAN'T SAY
WHAT I WOULD

21:44.371 --> 21:46.272
OR WHAT I WOULDN'T DO
IN YOUR POSITION.

21:46.373 --> 21:47.840
BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE IT,
CAN'T YOU?

21:47.940 --> 21:51.043
COME ON, JUST GIVE ME
AN HONEST ANSWER.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.779
I'M PAYING FOR YOUR
OPINION, AREN'T I?

21:52.879 --> 21:54.180
IN A SENSE, YES.

21:54.280 --> 21:57.617
BUT WE ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
WITH DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.687
I'M WONDERING WHY,
WALTER,

22:00.787 --> 22:04.491
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU
THAT I BACK YOU UP
ON THIS.

22:04.591 --> 22:08.461
I DON'T NEED YOUR
GODDAMN PERMISSION.

22:08.561 --> 22:11.030
I ASKED YOU FOR
SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.633
I HAVE INSOMNIA.
IT'S A REAL PROBLEM,

22:13.733 --> 22:16.803
A CONCRETE PROBLEM
THAT PREVENTS ME
FROM FUNCTIONING.

22:16.903 --> 22:19.138
I CAME HERE AND I SAID,
"TELL ME WHAT TO DO"--

22:19.238 --> 22:22.642
MENTAL EXERCISES,
BREATHING TECHNIQUES.

22:22.742 --> 22:27.079
NOW YOU'VE GOT ME
READING MY DAUGHTER'S
PRIVATE EMAILS TO YOU.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.481
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

22:28.581 --> 22:31.751
HOW MUCH
DO I OWE YOU?

22:31.851 --> 22:33.986
WALTER.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.188
WALTER, ARE YOU OKAY?

22:36.288 --> 22:39.125
WALTER, ANSWER ME,
PLEASE.

22:39.225 --> 22:40.993
- ARE YOU ON MEDICATION?
- NO, I'M NOT.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.495
DO YOU HAVE A DOCTOR
I CAN CALL?

22:42.595 --> 22:45.031
JUST GIVE ME SOME AIR.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.405
OKAY OKAY.

22:52.505 --> 22:55.575
YOU'RE OKAY, WALT.
YOU'RE OKAY, WALT.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.483
IT'S OKAY, WALTER.
BREATHE.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.653
BREATHE.
BREATHE.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.756
THAT'S IT.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.728
- OKAY?
- OKAY.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.630
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY TO GET UP?
- YES.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.132
- OKAY, LET ME HELP YOU.
- OKAY.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.772
- YOU FEEL OKAY?
- YEAH.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.577
YOU CAN STAY
FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

23:30.677 --> 23:34.614
NO NO, I TOLD YOU,
I'M FINE NOW.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.517
LISTEN,

23:37.617 --> 23:40.086
I'M SORRY IF I GAVE YOU
A SCARE BACK THERE.

23:40.186 --> 23:42.321
- IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
- I KNEW IT WOULD GO AWAY.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.291
THEY ALWAYS DO.

23:45.391 --> 23:47.627
HAS THIS
HAPPENED BEFORE?

23:49.395 --> 23:51.764
THEY GO AWAY.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.748
