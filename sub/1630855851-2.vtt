WEBVTT

00:24.111 --> 00:25.946
Look at that.

00:25.946 --> 00:27.948
You wear fine things well.

01:32.721 --> 01:34.931
Mornin' time!

01:37.142 --> 01:39.519
Mornin' time!

01:40.353 --> 01:41.855
That is irritating.

01:41.855 --> 01:44.775
- I was out.
- Me too.

01:44.775 --> 01:46.943
The best night's sleep I've had in ages,
if I'm honest.

01:46.943 --> 01:49.863
Aye. The sea is a medicine
of the gods, eh?

01:49.863 --> 01:51.531
Good morning, my friends!

01:51.531 --> 01:53.200
- Hey, it's Zheng.
- Good morning!

01:53.200 --> 01:55.035
Did we all have a restful sleep?

01:57.496 --> 02:00.082
Oh, excellent. So did I.

02:00.499 --> 02:03.043
The sea's restorative, isn't it?

02:03.043 --> 02:06.755
Yes, Queen! I've always said so!

02:07.089 --> 02:08.507
Oh, that guy knows.

02:08.507 --> 02:10.258
Why are some people calling her "queen"?

02:10.258 --> 02:15.055
Apparently, she conquered
some place called China.

02:15.680 --> 02:16.848
- China?
- China.

02:16.848 --> 02:21.228
Please, welcome your new crewmates
aboard the "Red Flag."

02:24.439 --> 02:25.649
Lovely to be here.

02:26.441 --> 02:28.026
Thank you. Yeah.

02:28.026 --> 02:30.987
Shame about the wake-up.
Is that every morning, the bell?

02:31.780 --> 02:36.660
<i>You'll find that we have a specific way
of doing things on this ship.</i>

02:36.660 --> 02:43.708
<i>Our way of life focuses on unity,
cohesion, mutual support, and balance.</i>

02:43.708 --> 02:47.462
<i>Historically,
men have a harder time fitting in here.</i>

02:47.838 --> 02:50.048
But we decided to take a chance
on you because--

02:51.299 --> 02:54.136
How should I put this? Your energy is--

02:54.928 --> 02:57.806
- Tender?
- We're tender as hell.

03:00.016 --> 03:02.477
- I was gonna say...
- Weak.

03:02.477 --> 03:03.437
Soft.

03:04.855 --> 03:06.982
- No offense.
- None taken.

03:07.733 --> 03:09.776
There is one other man on board.

03:10.902 --> 03:13.447
Rat Boy! Come!

03:13.447 --> 03:15.449
The fit on these is lovely.

03:15.449 --> 03:17.033
What's new, Queen?

03:18.994 --> 03:22.205
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

03:23.081 --> 03:25.292
Oh, my God! You guys!

03:33.717 --> 03:35.552
Oh, my God.

03:36.011 --> 03:39.014
Men are so fucking emotional.

03:43.977 --> 03:45.145
I thought you died!

03:45.145 --> 03:46.855
I know. I think a lot of people did.

03:46.855 --> 03:48.440
And now you have a beard?

03:48.440 --> 03:49.816
Do ya hate it?

03:49.816 --> 03:51.318
I love it.

03:54.154 --> 03:55.572
I love all of it.

03:57.157 --> 03:59.659
Rat Boy. What's that about?

04:02.746 --> 04:03.872
I'm trying to think about this,

04:04.623 --> 04:05.957
I think it's like,

04:05.957 --> 04:09.669
it's like a lunar calendar
thing or some--

04:10.170 --> 04:12.172
What exactly happened to you, Lucius?

04:13.548 --> 04:14.633
I was--

04:20.722 --> 04:23.100
I fell, off the ship.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.060
That doesn't sound like you.

04:25.060 --> 04:27.312
You have impeccable balance, babe.

04:27.813 --> 04:28.897
Attention!

04:31.441 --> 04:34.820
Right. Armament. Kitchen.

04:34.820 --> 04:36.196
Tailors duty.

04:36.196 --> 04:37.406
Yes!

04:37.406 --> 04:39.449
Towels. You go with Rat Boy.

04:39.449 --> 04:41.034
Fuck.

04:41.034 --> 04:44.788
Towels? What is this? Are these jobs?

04:44.788 --> 04:46.039
What's happening?

04:46.373 --> 04:49.334
Lucius? I'm overqualified for towels.

04:50.585 --> 04:52.212
Sea witch.

04:54.714 --> 04:58.760
I have looked for you far and wide.

04:58.760 --> 05:01.596
But then you probably know that.

05:02.097 --> 05:04.933
Best not assume
we know anythin' at all, Mum.

05:05.434 --> 05:09.646
Be gone, wise demon. Await for me above.

05:10.897 --> 05:12.733
Aye, aye, Mum.

05:16.987 --> 05:18.196
<i>Captain?</i>

05:19.823 --> 05:21.032
Captain?

05:22.784 --> 05:25.245
- Captain--
- Hey, there he is!

05:25.245 --> 05:27.289
Here I am. You're looking chipper.

05:27.289 --> 05:30.250
Thank you.
Feel like a million bucks, actually.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.127
Yeah, I had a very rough night last night.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.257
But I think I got all the poison
out of my system.

05:37.257 --> 05:40.969
It's a new day.
No more booze, no more drugs.

05:41.553 --> 05:44.222
- And more importantly, no more Izzy.
- Nope.

05:44.222 --> 05:45.474
Nope. You did kill him, didn't ya?

05:45.474 --> 05:46.725
Certainly did. Ages ago.

05:46.725 --> 05:48.435
- Good.
- Thank you.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.437
It's a nasty business, I know it.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.189
But that's the code of the sea:
the new first mate

05:52.189 --> 05:53.440
always kills the old first mate.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.983
It's always been like that.

05:54.983 --> 05:58.111
It's about trust.
Trust is so important.

05:58.612 --> 06:01.698
Oh, yeah. Trust is king and queen.

06:01.698 --> 06:02.783
Trust is everything.

06:06.578 --> 06:10.248
Well, better go and do the rounds.
Make sure everything's ship-shape.

06:10.916 --> 06:12.125
Hey, Frenchie.

06:12.959 --> 06:14.169
Yes, Captain.

06:15.128 --> 06:16.755
I expect great things from you.

06:18.715 --> 06:19.716
Thanks.

06:30.268 --> 06:32.854
Kill me, you fucking cowards!

06:33.438 --> 06:35.899
Lord above he smells somethin' terrible!

06:35.899 --> 06:37.692
Yeah, his leg's rotting!

06:37.692 --> 06:38.944
It needs to be cut off.

06:38.944 --> 06:40.529
We just had him asleep.
You're freakin' him out.

06:40.529 --> 06:41.530
Kill me--

06:42.489 --> 06:44.533
Alright.
Just listen, listen, listen, listen.

06:44.533 --> 06:46.159
Start with his leg, see where it goes.

06:46.159 --> 06:47.119
Okay.

06:47.953 --> 06:50.080
I've never done this before. Which one?

06:50.080 --> 06:52.374
Definitely the fucked-up one.
I think that one's all right.

06:52.374 --> 06:54.292
I'm not a fucking idiot. Which one?

06:54.292 --> 06:55.585
Oh! Oh.

06:57.421 --> 06:58.380
Dealer's choice.

06:58.380 --> 07:01.174
- Yeah. Alright.
- Alright.

07:01.174 --> 07:03.593
<i>- Uno, dos--
- Tres.</i>

07:05.178 --> 07:08.181
He's a gusher! He's a gusher!
That is a lot of blood.

07:09.558 --> 07:11.768
And of course,
we haven't seen each other in ages.

07:12.436 --> 07:13.895
I know. It's terrible.

07:13.895 --> 07:15.939
So I'm using this long list of crimes

07:15.939 --> 07:20.819
and dramatic upsets to basically
triangulate where he's most likely to be.

07:21.820 --> 07:24.239
Hang on. He might be in Cuba!

07:24.781 --> 07:28.118
Maggie, Jane, Tiff.

07:28.869 --> 07:30.495
Give us the room.

07:31.663 --> 07:33.248
Is that Cuba?

07:33.248 --> 07:35.167
So hard to tell.
I mean, I've drawn it myself.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.629
Lucius, look.

07:39.629 --> 07:41.798
They drew him to look like a ghoul.

07:42.632 --> 07:44.384
Are you even gonna ask how I am?

07:46.261 --> 07:49.306
- How are you?
- Fuck you! That's how I am.

07:49.681 --> 07:50.849
What's gotten into you?

07:50.849 --> 07:54.311
I didn't fall off "The Revenge."
He pushed me.

07:54.770 --> 07:57.606
Ed pushed you? Why would he do that?

07:58.065 --> 08:00.901
You broke him when you left,
and then he broke me.

08:00.901 --> 08:04.237
Everything that's happened to me
since has been your fault!

08:04.237 --> 08:06.239
Wait! Lucius.

08:06.907 --> 08:09.284
Come on. Where are you going?

08:09.284 --> 08:12.579
Oh, yeah. Now you care?

08:20.837 --> 08:24.174
I see you've adopted
the form of a humble man, sea witch.

08:25.634 --> 08:27.135
I've an offering for you:

08:27.844 --> 08:31.473
a spell book on therianthropy.

08:32.015 --> 08:38.814
The ability to transmogrify
betwixt human and non-human forms.

08:39.356 --> 08:41.858
Take it, thou demon.

08:41.858 --> 08:45.153
Use it wisely. Bless our travels.

08:51.410 --> 08:52.828
Oh, aye.

08:54.538 --> 08:57.165
Ohh, aye.

08:58.291 --> 09:01.253
Right. What have we here?

09:02.003 --> 09:03.964
- Lord above.
- Hey.

09:03.964 --> 09:05.465
Was someone injured?

09:05.799 --> 09:11.847
No. No, just assembling the first aid kit,
in case of anything.

09:13.056 --> 09:16.351
- Quick question.
- Fire away. Not literally, I hope.

09:16.351 --> 09:17.978
How'd you kill Izzy?

09:19.187 --> 09:21.982
Slit his throat. Classic.

09:24.818 --> 09:27.821
Now, you're left-handed, aren't you?

09:28.405 --> 09:30.782
- You just used your right.
- Did I?

09:32.242 --> 09:35.704
Must've got mixed up.
Ya know, bit of panto for the Captain.

09:35.704 --> 09:37.122
Panto?

09:38.373 --> 09:40.792
- I'm curious.
- Okay.

09:41.460 --> 09:46.006
Do you think I wouldn't know the smell
of my rotting former first mate?

09:48.717 --> 09:52.053
That is one stank-ass leg,
done and dusted.

09:53.805 --> 09:56.433
We did it! He'll live?

09:59.060 --> 10:01.104
50/50 I reckon.

10:01.104 --> 10:04.524
Yeah, he's very still right now.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.530
What's your interest in this guy anyway?
He seems like a bit of a dick.

10:10.530 --> 10:12.240
He is.

10:14.451 --> 10:16.078
But he's our dick.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.123
There was a time when life meant something
on this ship.

10:24.086 --> 10:25.462
When we lived for each other.

10:28.465 --> 10:30.300
Not just to survive.

10:31.593 --> 10:34.387
Guess you never know when
you're in the middle of the good old days.

10:44.773 --> 10:46.108
What was that for?

10:48.610 --> 10:52.614
You have hope. It's cute.

10:53.532 --> 10:57.327
Plus, I really like
that story that you told

10:57.327 --> 11:00.789
about the wooden demon boy
that thirsted for life.

11:00.789 --> 11:03.083
Or was it blood?
No, I was cleaning up the blood--

11:08.004 --> 11:09.881
What have we got here.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.218
Hey, no one told me this room existed.

11:16.263 --> 11:18.473
Leave me, all of you.

11:22.310 --> 11:24.312
Take the fuckin' leg.

11:29.192 --> 11:31.153
He was your friend.

11:52.716 --> 11:54.384
I know what you're doing.

11:54.384 --> 11:58.972
What am I doing? I just need someone
to clean my office and do some filing.

11:58.972 --> 12:01.683
You don't need this kind of distraction.

12:02.309 --> 12:06.313
- He doesn't even know what filing is.
- Of course, he does.

12:10.025 --> 12:11.485
How are you filing those?

12:11.485 --> 12:13.361
I'm kind of sortin' them by weight.

12:13.361 --> 12:15.655
Now, I could do it by width if you wanted.

12:15.655 --> 12:18.700
Or I could even open it up
and do it like that.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.620
The main thing is off the floor.

12:21.620 --> 12:22.913
You're doin' great.

12:24.331 --> 12:25.207
Thanks.

12:28.251 --> 12:30.921
- I had a system.
- What was your system?

12:30.921 --> 12:36.510
Well, you wouldn't understand
because it was ahead of its time.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.306
What have you done?

12:41.306 --> 12:44.351
Oh, yeah,
I thought I'd tidy that up a bit.

12:44.351 --> 12:46.311
You know, the little ships were
all over the place

12:46.311 --> 12:47.562
and some of them were over land.

12:47.562 --> 12:49.022
- It was just messy--
- Silence!

12:49.898 --> 12:56.071
Each of these ships was placed on
a particular coordinate

12:56.071 --> 13:00.325
and moved daily based on the current,

13:00.325 --> 13:04.830
weather patterns, and wind speed.

13:05.997 --> 13:06.957
Fuck.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.669
Well, let me fix it because I remember--

13:10.669 --> 13:12.254
- Back...
- Or not.

13:12.254 --> 13:14.923
- ...away.
- Why don't we get some air?

13:14.923 --> 13:16.007
Okay.

13:16.633 --> 13:19.136
I mean, I thought I did it
in the right colors and stuff.

13:19.136 --> 13:21.513
I'm so sorry about the big board.

13:21.513 --> 13:24.224
- Your aunt seemed proper pissed.
- Ignore that.

13:24.224 --> 13:26.601
Pissed is her natural state.

13:26.601 --> 13:29.479
Yeah, but I think she has a right,
you know, to pull the knife.

13:29.479 --> 13:31.732
I have no business filin' scrolls.

13:31.732 --> 13:33.066
I mean, you conquered Chee-na.

13:33.066 --> 13:35.318
- China.
- Chi-- Shit.

13:35.318 --> 13:38.113
China. China. China. China. China.

13:38.113 --> 13:39.948
I can't even get that right.

13:42.659 --> 13:46.747
I mean, you can't file to save your life.

13:46.747 --> 13:48.790
And I'm pretty sure you broke the abacus.

13:48.790 --> 13:50.625
Yeah, I fucked that up.

13:50.625 --> 13:54.546
But you're calm, and you're smart, and

13:56.673 --> 14:03.221
I actually-- I really liked it
when you would visit the soup stand.

14:05.807 --> 14:07.100
Did you?

14:07.100 --> 14:11.563
I mean, it was work,
but when you showed up, it wasn't.

14:11.563 --> 14:15.859
You were kinda,
you were kinda like the break in my day.

14:16.693 --> 14:18.070
I don't know.

14:18.070 --> 14:21.740
I've never been called "the break"
in anyone's day before.

14:27.079 --> 14:28.914
Are you guys tasting this?

14:28.914 --> 14:31.750
This broth, it's beautiful,

14:31.750 --> 14:34.503
complicated, balanced.

14:35.170 --> 14:36.922
It might be the best thing I've ever had.

14:38.048 --> 14:41.718
We eat but how often do we taste?

14:42.094 --> 14:43.720
Yeah, the broth's pretty wild.

14:44.012 --> 14:46.014
So wild. It's insane.

14:46.723 --> 14:48.642
Jesus Christ, Stede, keep your pants on.

14:49.726 --> 14:52.813
So, babe, you smoke now?

14:53.772 --> 14:56.024
Do I? Oh, yeah. Yeah.

14:56.858 --> 14:59.486
I must've picked it up
somewhere or something. I don't know.

15:00.737 --> 15:05.242
Ya don't know if ya picked up smokin'?

15:05.992 --> 15:09.955
I used to chew the old tobacco leaf
when I was young and edgy.

15:10.330 --> 15:12.624
Look at his beard. Mr. Cool.

15:15.168 --> 15:17.170
Isn't this the best ship
you've ever been on?

15:18.130 --> 15:20.799
Being captained by Zheng,
it really makes the shitty,

15:20.799 --> 15:23.176
pathetic, incompetent captains stand out.

15:25.554 --> 15:27.013
Okay.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.725
My spicy little Rat Boy.

15:30.725 --> 15:32.394
Never fuckin' call me that!

15:33.520 --> 15:35.689
God, I'm sorry,
I don't know where that--

15:35.689 --> 15:40.068
I'm gonna go fix something in towels.

15:44.364 --> 15:46.992
What the hell is going on in towels?

15:54.958 --> 15:56.543
- Morning.
- My leg.

15:56.543 --> 16:00.672
Yeah. Oh, no, that's gone now.
Up in Leg Heaven.

16:02.340 --> 16:04.509
Have you come to take the other one?

16:04.509 --> 16:06.845
I think one's quite enough.

16:06.845 --> 16:09.931
I just popped down
to say a proper goodbye.

16:15.103 --> 16:17.314
I had a dream about you last night.

16:21.651 --> 16:22.819
- Take it.
- Oh, fuck off.

16:22.819 --> 16:25.947
- Fuck off. Fuck off!
- Hold it! Hold it.

16:28.909 --> 16:31.912
I dreamt that ya killed me.

16:34.539 --> 16:36.750
Shot me right through the skull.

16:43.632 --> 16:44.841
Good for you.

16:46.802 --> 16:48.345
It was good for me.

16:48.887 --> 16:51.139
It's just what the doctor ordered.

16:51.139 --> 16:54.059
Anyway, it wasn't even like that.

16:54.601 --> 16:55.894
Not in my dream.

16:59.231 --> 17:00.857
I was standing.

17:02.651 --> 17:04.861
Just like this.

17:24.881 --> 17:26.675
You scared, Eddie?

17:28.176 --> 17:31.763
Too scared to do it yourself.
Ay?

17:35.642 --> 17:37.436
Go on. Clean up your own fuckin' mess.
I'm not doin' it.

17:37.436 --> 17:39.312
I've been doin' it all my fuckin' life.

17:40.522 --> 17:41.732
Fuck off.

17:44.568 --> 17:46.278
Farewell, old chum.

18:02.669 --> 18:04.296
I loved you

18:05.213 --> 18:06.840
best I could.

18:13.180 --> 18:16.641
Yeah, sorry. I know you said you're
expecting a lot from me,

18:16.641 --> 18:17.934
Captain.

18:19.728 --> 18:22.147
But do you wanna do this here
or down at the bottom of the ship

18:22.147 --> 18:24.232
'cause I can just jump over
and make it easier.

18:25.525 --> 18:29.404
Listen, if you weren't
such a treacherous liar,

18:29.404 --> 18:32.240
I wouldn't have had closure with Izzy,
so I thank you for that.

18:34.034 --> 18:35.702
Yeah, you're welcome. You're welcome.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.705
Take the day off, brother.

18:38.705 --> 18:40.582
- Go live.
- Yeah?

18:40.957 --> 18:42.417
Sure you don't want me
to do any steerings?

18:42.417 --> 18:45.796
Nah.
Do me good to be at the wheel for a bit.

18:47.214 --> 18:48.673
Clear my head.

19:03.021 --> 19:04.898
Lucius, I hate seeing you like this.

19:04.898 --> 19:06.858
You can't keep it bottled in.

19:06.858 --> 19:09.027
I get that you're angry,
so be angry at me.

19:09.027 --> 19:10.320
Don't take it out on Pete.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.489
Stede Bonnet's giving me
relationship advice.

19:13.532 --> 19:14.574
Yes! He is, actually.

19:14.574 --> 19:17.285
Because he's older than you,
and he knows more.

19:17.285 --> 19:20.080
I've got an ex-wife, two messed-up kids, probably,

19:20.080 --> 19:22.582
and I hurt Ed so much,
he pushed you off the ship!

19:22.582 --> 19:24.292
Sounds like you're quite the fuck-up, pal.

19:24.292 --> 19:28.130
Yeah, I am. And I'm alone. Talk to Pete.

19:28.713 --> 19:30.715
Don't be like me.

19:30.715 --> 19:32.717
If I start,
I don't know what's gonna come out.

19:32.717 --> 19:35.929
Look, if you're afraid inside, it's okay.

19:35.929 --> 19:38.432
But I'm not. Just hit me with it.

19:40.350 --> 19:42.894
One doesn't just survive at sea.

19:43.728 --> 19:45.105
One has to do things.

19:46.148 --> 19:47.441
Horrible things.

19:48.275 --> 19:50.277
Yep. Yeah. I know. I know.

19:51.945 --> 19:54.030
I passed from ship to ship,

19:54.030 --> 19:57.117
and one of them had this rat terrier
named Pepper,

19:57.117 --> 20:00.162
and Pepper was, ya know,
a pretty good friend, ya know?

20:01.163 --> 20:02.789
That's nice. Dogs are nice.

20:02.789 --> 20:04.207
- They ate him!
- Oh, no!

20:04.207 --> 20:05.876
- Yeah. They fuckin' ate him.
- What?

20:05.876 --> 20:07.294
- Why?
- I don't know! For a laugh.

20:07.294 --> 20:09.588
And then I had to catch
the rats with my teeth.

20:09.588 --> 20:10.797
They were weirdly finicky about that.

20:10.797 --> 20:11.757
Well, that's why you're called--

20:11.757 --> 20:12.841
- Rat Boy!
- Rat Boy!

20:12.841 --> 20:14.384
- Oh, God.
- And then--

20:14.384 --> 20:16.052
- Oh, God, you're not gonna believe it.
- You know what?

20:16.052 --> 20:17.679
- Save the rest for Pete--
- No, no, listen,

20:17.679 --> 20:19.181
there was this game
called the Human Puppet.

20:19.181 --> 20:21.767
- Save it!
- Stede, the hand went where you think!

20:21.767 --> 20:23.310
Lucius, please!

20:23.310 --> 20:26.229
I haven't even told you
about the little man who died in my lap.

20:26.605 --> 20:29.816
He wasn't even a child,
he was just a very small man!

20:30.484 --> 20:31.651
Oh, God.

20:33.403 --> 20:34.362
So,

20:34.362 --> 20:36.406
- do we think he's better?
- Fuck, no.

20:36.406 --> 20:38.742
Well, I don't know about that.
He seemed pretty calm to me.

20:38.742 --> 20:40.827
He said he just wanted to spend
some more time

20:42.370 --> 20:43.747
with nature.

20:47.167 --> 20:49.711
Hey! Do you want some help, Captain?

20:49.711 --> 20:52.672
- No, I'm good!
- We're sailing into a storm, boss!

20:55.467 --> 20:57.969
It suddenly looks that way,
doesn't it, brother?

20:57.969 --> 20:59.846
It's a bad one, too.

21:00.972 --> 21:03.725
And some maniac got rid of the wheel.

21:07.979 --> 21:09.940
Holy shit!

21:09.940 --> 21:12.484
Well, that's the Caribbean for you,
isn't it?

21:12.484 --> 21:15.112
Sunshine one minute, cataracts the next!

21:15.112 --> 21:16.947
You'll fucking kill us,
you fuckin' psycho!

21:16.947 --> 21:18.657
Maybe, maybe not!

21:18.657 --> 21:22.077
The odds of surviving a storm
like this are pretty low

21:22.077 --> 21:27.207
and if I fire one into the mast,
the chance will go right down to zero!

21:27.207 --> 21:29.084
What do you want, <i>pila de mierda?</i>

21:30.419 --> 21:35.215
What do I want?
I want you to fight her to the death!

21:35.215 --> 21:37.676
- Why?
- That's a bit misogynistic, man.

21:39.636 --> 21:41.179
Yeah, probably.

21:42.013 --> 21:45.058
All love dies!
I'm just hastening the process!

21:45.058 --> 21:47.727
Leave it, man,
we're not gonna fight to the death.

21:49.187 --> 21:50.772
That's more like it!

21:50.772 --> 21:54.860
In my experience,
it's kind of how stuff goes, ya know?

21:56.319 --> 21:57.946
That's the way!

22:08.999 --> 22:10.208
Hey.

22:11.209 --> 22:12.627
I talked to Pete.

22:13.795 --> 22:15.672
Well, that's wonderful.

22:15.672 --> 22:18.300
Please tell me you held back
on some of the darker stuff.

22:18.300 --> 22:22.137
Yeah. Yeah, he got nauseous
and he kind of started crying

22:22.137 --> 22:25.182
and I didn't wanna take him too far,
too fast, so we took a break.

22:25.557 --> 22:26.558
Good.

22:27.976 --> 22:29.644
You should take a close look at those.

22:29.644 --> 22:32.647
Past the clues to finding the man
you love but, you know,

22:32.647 --> 22:35.776
look at the horrible list of crimes
he's committed, you know.

22:35.776 --> 22:37.903
There are a few beheadings on here

22:37.903 --> 22:39.738
and it looks like
he's got back into arson

22:39.738 --> 22:42.616
and just being a bit of a dick.

22:44.326 --> 22:47.037
- And I think I hurt him pretty bad.
- Maybe.

22:47.579 --> 22:50.457
But maybe the time he spent with you
is the best it's ever gonna get for him.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.007
I'm not ready to believe that.

23:00.592 --> 23:04.137
Some people are just broken
no matter what ya do.

23:13.814 --> 23:17.818
Come on! End her! Or I end us all!

23:17.818 --> 23:20.529
It's okay. It's just life.

23:20.529 --> 23:23.615
Come on! Do it!

23:24.658 --> 23:26.243
Not on my life.

23:34.167 --> 23:35.710
That's too bad!

23:36.002 --> 23:38.213
You were gonna do it anyway!

23:40.757 --> 23:43.552
I was. I was.

24:38.523 --> 24:41.109
You indestructible little fucker!

24:53.705 --> 24:55.832
<i>Pull!</i>

24:56.041 --> 25:01.046
And pull! And pull!

25:01.630 --> 25:06.593
Pull! Steady! Steady!

25:26.363 --> 25:27.989
Finally.

26:49.654 --> 26:54.785
I will spare his life just this once,
but he is to come nowhere near the board.

26:54.785 --> 26:58.747
His domain will be the scrolls,
cleaning the dishes,

26:58.747 --> 27:01.333
and collecting random hairs
from around your desk.

27:01.333 --> 27:03.543
There's not that many hairs.

27:05.712 --> 27:09.049
Queen, urgent carrier bird
requesting your presence.

27:09.049 --> 27:11.093
Okay, I should take this.

27:12.511 --> 27:15.305
- What's the message?
- There's no message,

27:15.305 --> 27:17.390
I just thought you could use a break.
