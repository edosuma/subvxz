WEBVTT

00:09.291 --> 00:12.250
Twelve yeah, that's it baby.
Feelin' it now, come on.

00:12.333 --> 00:15.166
Ten, king, queen, minus three..

00:15.250 --> 00:18.250
Man, kid over here mumblin'
to hisself like Mr. Magoo.

00:19.625 --> 00:20.709
This is my
half-brother Terrance.

00:20.792 --> 00:21.750
He cool, man.

00:21.834 --> 00:24.250
Thought he was homeless.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.500
Man, forget all that,
aight? Just hit me.

00:28.625 --> 00:32.208
Ha ha ha. Bang, you
busted.
Gimme some money, man.

00:32.291 --> 00:34.083
Dang, alright.

00:34.166 --> 00:35.667
Hold up.

00:37.583 --> 00:38.959
Yo, T, man,
gimme ten.

00:39.041 --> 00:40.875
- Naw, forget it, man. We
out.
- Come on, man.

00:40.959 --> 00:42.959
We wanna run with the big
dogs, we gotta bring it.

00:43.041 --> 00:45.417
You bringing it, alright. You
just keep giving it all away.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.625
Are you watchin' the
game?
I was just on a roll.

00:47.709 --> 00:50.125
I just need to get it back.

00:50.208 --> 00:51.959
Hey, boy, you wanna
ante up or take your

00:52.041 --> 00:54.125
half-ass brother on home?

00:55.750 --> 00:57.792
'I came to play here, man.'

00:57.875 --> 01:00.083
Twenty. Deal me in.

01:00.166 --> 01:01.333
What's up with this fool?

01:01.417 --> 01:03.625
- Naw, he just playin'.
- I said deal me in.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.166
Yo, T, what you doing?

01:17.250 --> 01:18.834
It's called
doublin' down. Hit me.

01:18.917 --> 01:21.542
Man, T, you can't double down
on no 17. You gonna bust.

01:21.625 --> 01:23.166
Another ten says
I beat every hand here.

01:25.291 --> 01:28.083
- It's your money, fool.
- I thought I said hit me.

01:32.917 --> 01:34.875
Twenty one.
What you got?

01:34.959 --> 01:36.000
Damn.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.083
Damn! Man, that was luck.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.208
Nine times out
of ten you would've

01:41.291 --> 01:42.834
bust on that same hand, chump.

01:42.917 --> 01:45.458
Nine times out of ten,
but there's 52 cards in the
deck

01:45.542 --> 01:47.834
and you already burnt
11 out of 12 face
cards

01:47.917 --> 01:49.333
'plus all your tens and aces.'

01:49.417 --> 01:51.458
'Leaving even odds,
I get a four or lower.'

01:51.542 --> 01:52.667
And I thank you for that.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.792
By the way, name's Terrance.

01:54.875 --> 01:56.166
How you like my
chump change now?

02:00.834 --> 02:02.417
Oh, let me see that.

02:34.834 --> 02:36.041
Boss, guy
over there
says

02:36.125 --> 02:38.291
he's the father of
a Terrance Carter.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.583
Teenage gunshot victim,
Back in '02.

02:40.667 --> 02:43.625
Wants to see if he can get
his son's personal effects

02:43.709 --> 02:44.959
'for keepsake.'

02:45.041 --> 02:46.625
Five years after the fact?

02:46.709 --> 02:49.458
Claims he hadn't seen
the boy since he was a
baby.

02:49.542 --> 02:50.750
'On the outs with the mother.'

02:50.834 --> 02:52.834
Asked if he could
get his son's wallet

02:52.917 --> 02:55.542
'said he needed his
Social Security number.'

02:55.625 --> 02:57.792
'Scumbag's trying
to commit fraud.'

02:57.875 --> 02:59.500
Pull the kid's social.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.125
Already on it.

03:05.834 --> 03:07.208
(John)
'Sir, I'm afraid
we can't release'

03:07.291 --> 03:08.583
'any evidence
or personal effects'

03:08.667 --> 03:11.291
until an investigation's
been closed. I'm sorry.

03:11.375 --> 03:12.917
So how's that
investigation going?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.250
'Five years now, ain't it?'

03:14.333 --> 03:16.125
Bullet was never
matched to any other case

03:16.208 --> 03:18.083
registered gun or otherwise.

03:18.166 --> 03:19.750
So what, case closed?

03:19.834 --> 03:22.000
There were people on that
block who know damn well

03:22.083 --> 03:23.875
who shot your son, Mr. Carter.

03:23.959 --> 03:25.875
Unfortunately, none are willing

03:25.959 --> 03:27.250
to cooperate with the police.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.875
Hmm. So that's
how it is now, huh?

03:29.959 --> 03:33.041
Just...chalk it up
to the neighborhood?

03:33.125 --> 03:35.125
- Didn't say that.
- 'So what then?'

03:35.208 --> 03:36.834
It's my son's fault
he got shot? That's it?

03:36.917 --> 03:38.667
Sure there's enough
blame to go around.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.500
- What?
- 'Mr. Carter.'

03:40.583 --> 03:42.125
If you know anyone

03:42.208 --> 03:44.291
anyone who might talk to us

03:44.375 --> 03:45.667
we'd always appreciate any help.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.250
Yeah, right.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.709
Otherwise, y'all
just done looking.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.792
Well, maybe we
should look
again.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.542
'Starting with
the rock that slug'

03:55.625 --> 03:58.166
just crawled out from under.

03:58.250 --> 03:59.792
Oh, turns out Terrance Carter's

03:59.875 --> 04:01.542
Social Security
number's still in use.

04:01.625 --> 04:05.083
Used to open three different
charge accounts since his
death.

04:05.166 --> 04:06.959
So either he's still
alive and kicking..

04:07.041 --> 04:09.291
Or somebody already
beat dad to the punch.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.125
Missed you at Jones last night.

04:45.208 --> 04:46.500
(Scotty)
'Oh, yeah, sorry, man.'

04:46.583 --> 04:50.125
Just got caught up
with this thing.

04:50.208 --> 04:52.792
- Blond or brunette?
- I wish.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.750
Some pain-in-the-ass ADA.

04:54.834 --> 04:57.500
Let me guess,
the redheaded nutcracker

04:57.583 --> 04:59.291
with the nice set of pins?

05:00.208 --> 05:02.750
Nah, just some, uh, dinosaur

05:02.834 --> 05:04.166
prepping an old
robbery in West.

05:04.250 --> 05:07.375
Original theory
on Terrance
Carter?

05:07.458 --> 05:09.291
Kid caught a random
bullet on a rooftop

05:09.375 --> 05:10.792
'in North Philly
five years ago.'

05:10.875 --> 05:12.417
Not so random.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.875
Find all kind of spent
shells up on those
rooftops.

05:14.959 --> 05:16.291
Thugs and bangers going up there

05:16.375 --> 05:18.542
to test out their
nines, .22s, you name it.

05:18.625 --> 05:21.375
So some punk taking
target practice drops a
kid

05:21.458 --> 05:23.000
with an unlucky stray.

05:23.083 --> 05:25.959
We know why
Terrance was up there?

05:26.041 --> 05:27.750
Drugs, guns, escape.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.917
Could've been just about
anything on that block.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.333
That's 29th Street turf

05:31.417 --> 05:32.959
no evidence of gang affiliation?

05:33.041 --> 05:35.583
Not really. Just this.

05:37.333 --> 05:41.750
Well, it looks like a name
and number. "Sam 6-7-8-9-2-3-5?"

05:41.834 --> 05:43.417
Phone number came
back to nothing.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.667
No kid named Sam,
witness or suspect.

05:48.333 --> 05:52.000
Statement from the kid's
mother was less than
helpful.

05:52.083 --> 05:54.250
Welfare mom, nowhere dad.

05:54.333 --> 05:55.583
Kid had no chance.

05:55.667 --> 05:56.750
No witnesses, no leads

05:56.834 --> 05:58.417
no big surprise on that block.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.750
Social Security number on

05:59.834 --> 06:01.333
Terrance Carter was first used

06:01.417 --> 06:04.667
'to open an account
shortly after he died.'

06:04.750 --> 06:05.917
(Scotty)
'"PECO?"'

06:06.709 --> 06:08.208
Philadelphia Electric.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.417
Well, same address
given for Terrance Carter.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.083
Residence of the mother,
Cheryl Carter.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.792
Wait, so mom just
steals
her dead kid's social?

06:17.875 --> 06:20.959
Probably figured
he wasn't using it.

06:21.041 --> 06:23.500
Parents like that,
who needs enemies?

06:24.667 --> 06:26.625
Nerve of that man.

06:26.709 --> 06:29.125
Trying to come in
and collect on
Terrance.

06:29.208 --> 06:30.625
(Will)
'When it comes
to picking the bones'

06:30.709 --> 06:33.875
of your dead son,
you got Gerald
beat.

06:33.959 --> 06:35.125
Excuse me?

06:35.208 --> 06:36.125
Only took you a week

06:36.208 --> 06:37.709
after your son's
murder to steal

06:37.792 --> 06:40.583
his Social Security number.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.583
Funeral wiped me out.

06:42.667 --> 06:43.792
'They cut me off'

06:43.875 --> 06:45.458
turned off all my utilities.

06:45.542 --> 06:48.917
You collected on the Victim's
Comp Fund for burial expenses.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.041
Barely covered a pine box.

06:51.125 --> 06:52.959
Terrance's father
never chipped in?

06:53.041 --> 06:54.709
Not a dime.

06:54.792 --> 06:57.625
Not worth a damn
as husband or a father.

06:57.709 --> 07:01.208
You don't know how tough it was
raising that boy on my own.

07:01.291 --> 07:02.834
Terrance get into trouble?

07:02.917 --> 07:04.792
Boy was nothing
but a daydreamer.

07:04.875 --> 07:08.375
Told him if he
wasn't
gonna go to school

07:08.458 --> 07:10.250
he needed to
find a way to
earn.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.250
How? He was only 14.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.542
I had two jobs
when I was his age.

07:14.625 --> 07:17.875
And school...didn't get
me nothing but pregnant.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.041
Legal dropout age is 16.

07:20.125 --> 07:23.125
Oh, you gonna lecture me now?

07:23.208 --> 07:26.417
What was Terrance doing up
on that roof when he got shot?

07:27.083 --> 07:28.500
Told the police

07:28.583 --> 07:30.208
he'd started hanging
up there with
Michael.

07:30.291 --> 07:33.166
- Michael?
- His half-brother.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.166
They grew up
on the same
block.

07:35.250 --> 07:38.041
'But Michael's mama,
she didn't raise him right.'

07:38.125 --> 07:39.875
Uh-huh.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.500
What were they doing up there?

07:41.583 --> 07:44.083
Playing the fool,
skipping school

07:44.166 --> 07:45.458
trying to duck me.

07:48.458 --> 07:51.041
- 'High or low, T?'
- High. Face card.

07:53.709 --> 07:55.000
Next.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.166
Low. Two,
three or
four.

07:57.250 --> 08:00.375
Come on, man.
I got this cold.

08:00.458 --> 08:01.875
You hear from dad?

08:02.875 --> 08:04.166
No. You?

08:04.250 --> 08:06.375
My mama got
a letter from inside.

08:06.458 --> 08:08.208
Asked how big I was.

08:08.291 --> 08:10.166
Said he wanted to catch up.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.417
He said that?

08:11.500 --> 08:13.625
Called me his "main man."

08:13.709 --> 08:16.625
Please. He's tryin'
to get back with my moms.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.333
He ask about me?

08:18.417 --> 08:20.875
Yeah. Yeah, you know..

08:22.333 --> 08:24.458
Forget it. Don't matter.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.250
(Terrance)
'What's up with
that bird man anyway?'

08:29.333 --> 08:31.583
Got all them locks on his birds.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.917
Crazy fool's got twice as
many locks on the apartment.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.250
'Heard he got a safe
full of cash too.'

08:36.333 --> 08:38.500
How them birds always
know to come back?

08:38.583 --> 08:40.959
Man, forget the birds.
Focus on the deck.

08:41.041 --> 08:42.875
Naw, man. We done
practicing. I got
it.

08:42.959 --> 08:45.959
(Michael)
'Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No more small-time.'

08:46.041 --> 08:48.166
We gonna hustle a man's game.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.709
Roll in with a shot caller.

08:49.792 --> 08:52.000
Now, come on.
Finish the deck, T.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.709
Six cards left in the deck.

08:53.792 --> 08:57.000
A deuce, a pair of eights
a jack and two kings

08:57.083 --> 09:00.417
Damn, man. We about to get rich.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.959
Or die trying.

09:04.166 --> 09:06.291
(Kat)
'Terrance was counting cards?'

09:06.375 --> 09:09.291
Some stupid corner
hustle, up to no
good.

09:09.375 --> 09:12.250
Only way to make money counting
cards is playing blackjack.

09:12.333 --> 09:15.375
Takes a real computer upstairs
to bring down the house.

09:15.458 --> 09:17.417
Terrance was real
good with numbers.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.125
What do you think he meant by
"roll in with a shot caller"

09:20.208 --> 09:21.959
hustling some card game?

09:22.041 --> 09:23.458
Don't know.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.667
But Michael
was always trying

09:25.750 --> 09:28.166
to suck my boy into it.

09:28.250 --> 09:31.333
Just like I told
the do-nothing police back
then.

09:31.417 --> 09:33.625
That kind of attitude
makes you friends.

09:33.709 --> 09:35.625
Didn't matter then to y'all

09:35.709 --> 09:38.000
just like I know it won't now.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.250
(Scotty)
'You finish up with
that head shrink yet?'

09:49.750 --> 09:51.792
What? First the boss, now you?

09:51.875 --> 09:54.917
I just want to know if
I'm
rollin' with a nut
job.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.542
One more session,
I'll be certified.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.083
(Lilly)
'That our guy?'

10:02.625 --> 10:05.250
(Scotty)
'How'd you get
the horse, Michael?'

10:06.917 --> 10:08.917
Grow up in a war
zone,
this how you end up.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.667
Another casualty
of the neighborhood

10:10.750 --> 10:12.583
just like your
dead half-brother.

10:12.667 --> 10:13.917
'Bout time y'all cared.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.834
You with Terrance
the night he got shot?

10:15.917 --> 10:17.500
I was home.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.625
Only took another year
for
a bullet to catch up with
me.

10:19.709 --> 10:21.250
(Michael)
'Tryin' to tell these
kids what happens'

10:21.333 --> 10:24.166
you run on the streets,
don't get your head on
straight.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.583
Terrance's mother seems
to think you know who shot
him.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.500
Y'all need to
consider the source.

10:28.583 --> 10:30.625
She never liked me
'cause of my mom.

10:30.709 --> 10:32.959
So what were you doing up
on that roof with Terrance

10:33.041 --> 10:34.458
talking some big card hustle?

10:34.542 --> 10:36.542
Just looking for
an angle to play.

10:36.625 --> 10:37.959
Stake our claim.

10:38.041 --> 10:39.417
What kind of angle?

10:41.250 --> 10:43.250
Setting a real good
example for these kids.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.458
'Keeping your mouth shut
about your brother's murder.'

10:45.542 --> 10:47.375
Five years now.

10:47.458 --> 10:48.917
That's real brave.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.083
And for what? Hmm?

10:52.500 --> 10:54.000
Lot of good it did you.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.542
There was only one
card game that mattered.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.083
But you ain't hear it from me.

10:58.166 --> 10:59.875
An underground card game?

10:59.959 --> 11:02.458
- 'Where?'
- Big Fat Ray's.

11:02.542 --> 11:04.208
Knew if I could get
T in on that game.

11:04.291 --> 11:06.458
Phew! We could do
some serious damage.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.458
How? You were just
a couple of kids.

11:08.542 --> 11:11.709
So how I got the idea to
set up the meet with Delonte.

11:11.792 --> 11:14.959
Knew if we rolled in with
him,
nobody would mess with us.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.709
Delonte?

11:16.792 --> 11:18.458
King.

11:18.542 --> 11:22.834
Banging thug. Shot caller
for the 29th Street Crew.

11:22.917 --> 11:25.250
Turned out Delonte had
other plans for Terrance.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.792
No disrespect, yo.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.583
Just got a proposition
for your man here is all.

11:39.291 --> 11:40.333
Huh?

11:40.417 --> 11:42.417
Michael, this is my
half-brother Terrance.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.792
Ready to go to work.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.083
I don't need no more corner boys

11:45.166 --> 11:46.959
slinging for me, man.

11:47.041 --> 11:49.083
Talking about
Big Fat Ray's game.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.792
You get us in the door,
we can run the table.

11:51.875 --> 11:53.750
'Y'all get half our cut.'

11:53.834 --> 11:55.709
I'm good with all
kinds of numbers.

11:55.792 --> 11:56.917
Like the code on
your door there.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.125
Say what?

12:02.375 --> 12:04.000
Punk must have seen
me punch in the code

12:04.083 --> 12:05.792
over my shoulder before

12:05.875 --> 12:07.959
like they do at them ATMs.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.542
(Delonte)
Now, hold up, chill.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.166
How'd you get
that code, young'un?

12:11.250 --> 12:13.458
That lock? Got about
3,000 combinations.

12:13.542 --> 12:15.500
Take ten minutes
to crack it cold

12:15.583 --> 12:17.041
but your man
here made it easy.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.291
Say what?

12:18.375 --> 12:19.667
There's ten numbers
on the keypad.

12:19.750 --> 12:20.959
But there's two to each button

12:21.041 --> 12:22.875
so it's really
just a five-digit
PIN.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.750
- So?
- So it cuts it in half.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.959
Some 1,600 possible numbers.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.792
'And since that 29th Street
ink
gave me the first two digits'

12:29.875 --> 12:31.458
figured there's only
a couple hundred
left.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.583
Now by looking at the
keypad
I saw the five-six

12:33.667 --> 12:35.750
'seven-eight buttons were
worn down by fingerprints.'

12:35.834 --> 12:37.875
Which makes sense,
it's a Sixers town.

12:37.959 --> 12:40.875
So 29-76,
got one number
left

12:40.959 --> 12:43.333
figure I got a one in five shot.

12:43.417 --> 12:44.667
Guess I just guessed right.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.291
How'd you get that last number?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.166
What?

12:49.250 --> 12:51.083
Your shirt, fool.
The number.

12:53.709 --> 12:55.500
Aight, young'un.

12:55.583 --> 12:59.000
Know about the safe
bolted into the floor.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.792
You got to get
in and out, quick.

13:00.875 --> 13:04.583
Keypad lock or combo we can get
it done in under ten minutes.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.291
Was I talking to you?

13:08.667 --> 13:10.041
Yeah, we could do it.

13:10.125 --> 13:13.083
- Let's line it up.
- Alright.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.875
Next week, then.

13:14.959 --> 13:17.333
But...you get caught

13:17.417 --> 13:19.208
you try to cross me?

13:19.291 --> 13:21.208
You don't wanna know me.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.250
(Scotty)
'Delonte used
you for break-ins?'

13:33.333 --> 13:35.250
Not me. Just Terrance.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.375
Couple weeks
later, T was
dead.

13:37.458 --> 13:38.959
You think Delonte
took him out.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.500
So Terrance could
never finger him.

13:41.583 --> 13:44.458
My boy T was special, you know?

13:44.542 --> 13:46.583
It's like a blessing
and a curse around here.

13:46.667 --> 13:47.875
A curse?

13:47.959 --> 13:49.834
Soon as people find
out you got
something

13:49.917 --> 13:51.750
'they want a piece of you.'

13:51.834 --> 13:53.709
Where's this, uh, Delonte now?

13:53.792 --> 13:56.417
He upstate on a stick-up he did.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.583
Just know, boy like
that don't snitch.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.500
And he ain't afraid
of doin' no time
either.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.667
Even the Devil makes deals.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.166
Maybe.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.250
But he always
get his in the end.

14:12.166 --> 14:13.917
So..

14:14.000 --> 14:16.083
...off the painkillers yet?

14:17.166 --> 14:19.000
Uh, been off.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.291
Um, wound's almost healed up.

14:21.375 --> 14:23.375
You haven't
been sleeping much.

14:23.458 --> 14:25.166
That obvious, huh?

14:25.250 --> 14:26.625
Any nightmares?

14:28.709 --> 14:30.166
Last session.

14:30.250 --> 14:32.458
Might as well go out
with a bang, right?

14:33.625 --> 14:35.041
So to speak.

14:38.166 --> 14:39.917
Um..

14:40.000 --> 14:42.458
...the other night, yeah.

14:42.542 --> 14:46.959
I had a dream. They were
wheeling me into the ER.

14:48.041 --> 14:49.542
Lights everywhere.

14:49.625 --> 14:52.291
- Voices.
- How'd you feel?

14:52.375 --> 14:54.041
How did I feel? Um..

14:56.583 --> 14:59.500
Scared, I guess.

14:59.583 --> 15:03.291
They were badgering me,
asking me questions.

15:03.375 --> 15:04.959
Questions like what?

15:05.041 --> 15:06.709
I-I can't remember.

15:06.792 --> 15:08.417
Try.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.458
"Is there anyone to call?
Who do you want us to
call?"

15:12.792 --> 15:15.917
- Something like that.
- Was there?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.625
Was there what?

15:17.709 --> 15:20.667
Anyone to call, Lilly?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.208
'When you're in
a situation like that'

15:22.291 --> 15:24.500
'you ask yourself these things'

15:24.583 --> 15:27.417
'take inventory of your life.'

15:27.500 --> 15:29.834
'What you've done,
whom you've loved.'

15:29.917 --> 15:32.208
That's what your
nightmare's telling you.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.583
That photo's gotta
be what, 15 years
old?

15:38.542 --> 15:41.750
Your daughter, Jessica, she's..

15:41.834 --> 15:44.125
...not a little girl
anymore, is she?

15:44.208 --> 15:46.250
You didn't answer the question.

15:46.333 --> 15:49.875
No prom, graduation
wedding photos.

15:50.875 --> 15:53.500
Just wonder why.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.875
'You two still
even talk anymore?'

15:56.750 --> 15:58.750
Maybe not.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.375
That's why you fix
other people's problems.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.458
'Cause you can't fix your own?

16:02.542 --> 16:04.125
That's impressive.

16:04.208 --> 16:07.000
'Too bad you can't see
yourself the way you see me.'

16:10.333 --> 16:11.375
Oh, I, uh..

16:11.458 --> 16:13.208
My time's up

16:17.041 --> 16:19.083
The nightmares
won't end, Lilly.

16:19.166 --> 16:21.250
Until you can do that.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.250
(Nick)
'Sit down.'

16:48.375 --> 16:50.250
Remember him, Delonte?

16:52.709 --> 16:54.458
Another dead
clocker off the block?

16:54.542 --> 16:56.250
Terrance Carter,
five years back

16:56.333 --> 16:57.542
wasn't a clocker

16:57.625 --> 16:58.917
'but he sure was
good with numbers.'

16:59.000 --> 17:00.041
Kid you thought might be good

17:00.125 --> 17:02.083
at cracking combinations.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.417
That code scribbled on his
hand mean something to you?

17:06.208 --> 17:09.250
- I can't help you.
- You used him for break-ins.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.542
Did I now? Who told you that?

17:11.625 --> 17:13.000
No sweat off your back

17:13.083 --> 17:15.792
take Terrance out of
the picture after a
job.

17:15.875 --> 17:17.667
Leaving no one to flip on you.

17:19.625 --> 17:21.917
Sorry, fellas.
We done playin' footsie?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.917
CO says you're the alpha
dog on this cell block.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.959
'Makes sense, with half
your crew locked up in here.'

17:28.041 --> 17:30.166
I get anything
I want on the inside.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.500
Really?

17:31.583 --> 17:34.458
Don't see nothing
about conjugal visitation.

17:34.542 --> 17:35.959
(Delonte)
'Don't nobody get that.'

17:36.041 --> 17:39.208
See my baby mama through
the glass once a month.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.333
Saying we might be able
to pull some strings

17:41.417 --> 17:42.458
you play this right.

17:42.542 --> 17:43.750
So pull.

17:43.834 --> 17:46.417
Give us something
about the break-ins and..

17:46.500 --> 17:49.083
...maybe you get to
put your jack in a box.

17:49.166 --> 17:51.291
Glaze that ham
with some real honey.

17:54.917 --> 17:57.583
I used that punk
once for a break-in..

17:58.709 --> 17:59.792
...but it didn't work out.

17:59.875 --> 18:00.792
All the more reason

18:00.875 --> 18:01.959
to fear him snitching.

18:02.041 --> 18:03.458
Please.

18:03.542 --> 18:06.750
Kid was all brains and no balls.

18:06.834 --> 18:10.458
You ask me, wasn't no
pot shot took him out either.

18:28.333 --> 18:30.125
Check in there for the safe.

18:30.208 --> 18:32.166
Go, go.

18:56.542 --> 18:59.041
What you doing?

18:59.125 --> 19:00.250
Where's the safe?

19:01.375 --> 19:02.709
(male #1)
'Who's there?'

19:03.709 --> 19:05.500
He ain't supposed to be home.

19:15.792 --> 19:18.417
(Will)
'You hit the bird
man's apartment.'

19:18.500 --> 19:21.166
Crazy ol' coot
came home blasting.

19:21.250 --> 19:22.917
Was Terrance hit?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.375
Nah, just wet his pants.

19:25.458 --> 19:28.458
Didn't grab nothing
but some stupid notebook.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.500
But the bird man got
a good look at his face.

19:31.583 --> 19:32.500
So?

19:32.583 --> 19:33.542
So, kid got shot up

19:33.625 --> 19:34.709
on that roof, right?

19:34.792 --> 19:36.375
You're saying it's the bird man?

19:36.458 --> 19:38.208
He always up there.

19:38.291 --> 19:41.333
Figured he caught up
to the little man one day.

19:41.417 --> 19:42.875
Took him out.

19:54.166 --> 19:57.000
Had an uncle,
he used to raise birds.

19:58.417 --> 20:00.458
He's kinda plump
for a homing pigeon.

20:00.542 --> 20:02.667
Oscar's a rock pigeon.

20:02.750 --> 20:05.125
'Fell out a nest into
the gutter when he was a
baby.'

20:06.500 --> 20:08.583
Nursed him back to health.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.417
I need to talk to you
about a break-in, Augustine.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.250
Your apartment. Few years back.

20:13.333 --> 20:15.625
Shots fired.
Remember that?

20:18.041 --> 20:20.083
Some punks broke
into my place.

20:20.166 --> 20:21.959
Had to protect myself.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.625
Only you never reported it.

20:24.709 --> 20:27.166
9-1-1's a joke on this block.

20:27.250 --> 20:29.542
Boys got what was coming to 'em.

20:29.625 --> 20:31.667
Unfortunately, one
of 'em got shot.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.625
Right up here on
the roof of this building.

20:33.709 --> 20:36.834
Uh, 14-year-old Terrance
Carter.
Bullet from a nine.

20:36.917 --> 20:39.250
(Lilly)
'We check your apartment,
we gonna find that weapon?'

20:39.333 --> 20:41.583
Search away.
I didn't kill that
boy.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.875
The code...written on his hand..

20:46.458 --> 20:48.375
...mean anything to you?

20:48.458 --> 20:49.834
Nope.

20:49.917 --> 20:52.333
But he didn't talk much
about his personal life.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.667
You talked to
Terrance? When?

20:54.750 --> 20:57.000
Right up here on this roof.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.208
Under much
different
circumstances.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.333
- Sick of you damn kids--
- Wait, wait, wait.

21:12.417 --> 21:13.834
Trying to steal
from me again?

21:13.917 --> 21:14.959
I-I was just
trying to bring back

21:15.041 --> 21:17.000
what belonged to you.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.291
Who did this?

21:28.375 --> 21:29.500
I was just messin' around.

21:29.583 --> 21:31.792
I didn't mean to screw it up.

21:40.583 --> 21:43.250
How'd you do this? When?

21:43.333 --> 21:45.875
Don't know. Just,
I get caught up in
stuff.

21:45.959 --> 21:47.750
Lose track of time.

21:47.834 --> 21:49.250
I'm sorry.

21:49.333 --> 21:51.375
So that model airplane
in your apartment

21:51.458 --> 21:52.792
some kind of hobby?

21:52.875 --> 21:55.041
Some kind of career.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.500
You make planes with numbers?

21:57.583 --> 22:00.166
It's called design.
It's all about numbers.

22:00.250 --> 22:02.208
How you learn
about all that
stuff?

22:02.291 --> 22:04.625
Planes, birds, flying.

22:04.709 --> 22:06.417
Try the public library.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.959
Sounds boring.

22:10.875 --> 22:13.500
The more I know about
flight, the less I know.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.750
Gotta have a passion for it.

22:16.834 --> 22:18.667
But you wouldn't know
anything about that.

22:18.750 --> 22:19.917
Why's that?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.917
It would require
you to use your brain

22:22.000 --> 22:24.667
for something other than
trying to rip people off.

22:27.083 --> 22:28.750
(Terrance)
'That bird in the red cage.'

22:28.834 --> 22:30.583
How come he don't ever get out?

22:30.667 --> 22:32.375
Lost his will to fly.

22:32.458 --> 22:34.250
It's a bird, ain't it?

22:34.333 --> 22:36.250
So you're not only a thief,
you're a know-it-all

22:36.333 --> 22:37.625
pain-in-the-ass too?

22:37.709 --> 22:39.709
'Sup, T?

22:41.875 --> 22:43.667
Let's go.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.250
Race 'em.

22:50.333 --> 22:53.667
Every Thursday from
the basketball courts.

22:53.750 --> 22:54.959
Race what?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.291
The babies.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.458
Flight training.

22:58.542 --> 23:00.917
You'd probably
think it was boring.

23:09.583 --> 23:11.667
Kid was special.

23:11.750 --> 23:14.709
Raw mathematical
ability, off the
charts.

23:14.792 --> 23:16.792
He show up for the races?

23:16.875 --> 23:19.166
And the math
and flight
lessons.

23:19.250 --> 23:21.458
Tried to challenge him,
show him there's a world

23:21.542 --> 23:23.625
outside this block.

23:25.375 --> 23:27.000
Till the inevitable happened.

23:27.083 --> 23:28.375
What's that?

23:28.458 --> 23:30.792
Some con showed
up in his life.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.291
Some con?

23:32.375 --> 23:34.542
Claimed he was his father.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.542
Gerald Carter?

23:36.625 --> 23:38.291
'Came to see his son?'

23:38.375 --> 23:40.500
All I know is..

23:40.583 --> 23:42.792
...few days
after
dad shows up..

23:42.875 --> 23:44.750
'...I wake up to
feed my birds..'

23:45.875 --> 23:47.959
...and found
that boy's
body.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.333
Right over there.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.208
Got a real selective
memory, Gerald.

24:00.291 --> 24:02.417
(Will)
'Coming in here with
that tale of woe BS'

24:02.500 --> 24:04.667
about not getting
to see your son.

24:04.750 --> 24:08.000
Look, I came back around,
but my ex didn't know.

24:08.083 --> 24:11.166
Court said I owed child
support,
alimony, all that nonsense.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.959
- Nonsense?
- See?

24:14.041 --> 24:17.000
(Gerald)
'I knew the boy's mom would
flip
out she knew I contacted him.'

24:17.083 --> 24:20.709
So, why lie to us, unless you
had something else to hide?

24:20.792 --> 24:23.250
Me and the law,
on a need-to-know basis.

24:25.041 --> 24:27.125
Ain't about to change now.

24:31.625 --> 24:34.875
So, you hadn't seen
your son in years.

24:34.959 --> 24:36.709
'All of a sudden, you
pop up in his life.'

24:36.792 --> 24:38.667
'Couple days later, he's dead.'

24:38.750 --> 24:39.917
Bad coincidence.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.125
(Kat)
'Even worse, you split
again.'

24:42.208 --> 24:44.458
Didn't even stick
around to bury him.

24:46.291 --> 24:48.583
Maybe I wasn't the best father..

24:48.667 --> 24:51.125
...but Terrance was my blood.

24:51.208 --> 24:53.458
Came back 'cause I had
to give it another try.

24:56.500 --> 24:59.291
(Augustine)
Four basic forces of
physics at work in flight.

24:59.375 --> 25:00.959
Lift versus gravity.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.041
'Thrust versus drag.'

25:03.125 --> 25:05.750
- Bernoulli's principle.
- If you say so, boss.

25:05.834 --> 25:07.542
I didn't say so.
It's a fact.

25:07.625 --> 25:09.834
Flight is a delicate
balance of math and physics.

25:09.917 --> 25:11.917
- The larger the wing..
- 'The greater the lift.'

25:12.000 --> 25:15.417
- Wing aspect ratio. Got
that.
- Really?

25:17.458 --> 25:20.166
- Where'd you get that?
- Public library.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.583
That the formula you
used to design that

25:23.667 --> 25:25.500
plane in your apartment?

25:25.583 --> 25:28.875
I used to be an engineer.
Big firm. Long time ago.

25:28.959 --> 25:30.291
How'd you end up back here?

25:32.083 --> 25:35.458
Well, I wanted to rethink
the way we design planes.

25:35.542 --> 25:38.333
They didn't, so I left.

25:38.417 --> 25:40.333
Rethink?

25:40.417 --> 25:42.375
Birds have flexible wings.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.542
Took us thousands
of years to approximate

25:44.625 --> 25:47.959
what they just
come by naturally.

25:48.041 --> 25:49.959
Go ahead. Let her rip.

25:50.041 --> 25:52.125
- For real?
- Go on.

25:52.208 --> 25:53.583
It's what they're born to do.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.500
There are things
which seem incredible

26:05.583 --> 26:08.458
to most men who've
never studied mathematics.

26:08.542 --> 26:10.625
Never thought
about birds like that.

26:10.709 --> 26:12.458
"We're all in the gutter

26:12.542 --> 26:15.125
but some of us are
looking at the stars."

26:15.208 --> 26:16.625
Who said that?

26:16.709 --> 26:19.166
- Oscar Wilde.
- Oscar, huh?

26:20.542 --> 26:21.834
Terrence.

26:23.625 --> 26:24.625
Dad?

26:24.709 --> 26:26.834
Michael told me I
might find you
here.

26:26.917 --> 26:29.125
'Didn't mention how
big you went and got.'

26:29.208 --> 26:31.333
I was hoping we
could talk a
bit.

26:31.417 --> 26:33.750
Maybe catch me up
on some things,
huh?

26:35.583 --> 26:37.875
Keep your eye on the stars, kid.

26:39.542 --> 26:41.458
Come on, baby.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.542
So, baby, you be good.

26:51.333 --> 26:54.333
That bird man
wasn't his father.

26:54.417 --> 26:55.917
I was.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
You had a problem
with Augustine.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.834
Grown man hanging out
with my boy, acting white?

27:02.083 --> 27:03.500
Couldn't figure out his angle.

27:03.583 --> 27:06.709
That's no surprise.
You're not that
bright.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.166
But your son, he was special.

27:10.625 --> 27:12.625
At least one of 'em anyway.

27:12.709 --> 27:14.583
So that was your angle.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.709
You figured out
what Terrance could do.

27:16.792 --> 27:19.875
Michael told you
he could count
cards.

27:19.959 --> 27:21.667
Never heard nothing about that.

27:21.750 --> 27:24.041
Just glad we got to
spend some time together.

27:24.125 --> 27:26.375
A couple days later,
he winds up dead.

27:26.458 --> 27:29.041
Yeah, you're Father of the Year.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.542
Don't need to justify
nothing to y'all.

27:31.625 --> 27:33.625
He was my son.

27:33.709 --> 27:35.709
You're nothing
but a lowlife
con.

27:35.792 --> 27:38.375
I grew up around
shiftless fools like
you

27:38.458 --> 27:40.542
expect something for nothing.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.375
Who do you think you are, man?

27:42.458 --> 27:45.709
I'm the guy who goes around
cleaning up all your mess.

27:45.792 --> 27:48.875
Screwed up families and
sons
you don't even deserve.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.083
At least my boy understood.

27:53.875 --> 27:56.667
Never forget your people..

27:56.750 --> 27:58.417
...where you came from.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.917
What's that supposed to mean?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.542
I wouldn't expect a couple of
black cops to understand that.

28:07.291 --> 28:09.750
Go ahead. Take a swing.

28:09.834 --> 28:12.166
I could use the money.

28:15.792 --> 28:19.000
Just a matter of time
before
we sort this out, Gerald.

28:35.250 --> 28:37.667
Terrance went to
the library,
right?

28:37.750 --> 28:39.125
The number
written on his hand.

28:39.208 --> 28:41.875
Could be some sort
of reference number.

28:41.959 --> 28:43.333
What, like a book?

28:43.417 --> 28:48.333
I'm not sure if it's Dewey
Decimal, but it could be a
date.

28:48.417 --> 28:51.125
(John)
"6/7/89.

28:51.208 --> 28:52.792
Sam."

28:52.875 --> 28:55.792
I'm thinking
newspaper, magazine

28:55.875 --> 28:57.875
some sort of periodical?

28:59.083 --> 29:02.417
"23-5." Page number?

29:02.500 --> 29:04.375
Terrance looked
something up, but he
wasn't

29:04.458 --> 29:06.709
writing any book reports.

29:06.792 --> 29:09.291
Well, it's worth a shot.

29:09.375 --> 29:11.291
Hit the library, Dewey.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.834
S-A-M.
"San Antonio Mercury News."

29:20.917 --> 29:22.458
That's got to be it, right?

29:22.542 --> 29:25.792
- Your call, bro.
- Okay, June, '89..

29:27.000 --> 29:28.458
(Nick)
'That's the reason'

29:28.542 --> 29:30.458
'I did not make
it through college.'

29:30.542 --> 29:33.208
Yeah, college blows, dude.

29:35.250 --> 29:39.542
June 7th, 1989, page 23.

29:39.625 --> 29:41.542
'Plane crash outside of Dallas.'

29:41.625 --> 29:43.417
'Take a look.'

29:44.750 --> 29:46.333
Uh, "Civilian plane

29:46.417 --> 29:49.083
down in flames,
killed five
people."

29:50.208 --> 29:51.500
Keep going.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.458
(Scotty)
'"Mechanical
malfunction attributed

29:53.542 --> 29:55.542
'"to a flaw in
the airplane's design.

29:55.625 --> 29:58.667
Aeronautical firm
named in the
lawsuit."

29:59.667 --> 30:01.333
And one particular engineer.

30:01.417 --> 30:03.625
"Augustine Bennett."

30:03.709 --> 30:05.875
Talk about a career-killer.

30:05.959 --> 30:08.041
And Terrance found out.

30:10.125 --> 30:11.959
(John)
'You're a proud man,
Augustine.'

30:12.041 --> 30:15.208
'Once a top-flight
aeronautical engineer.'

30:15.291 --> 30:16.959
But you screwed up.

30:17.041 --> 30:19.375
Big time.

30:19.458 --> 30:22.291
Plane you designed back
in the '80s went down.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.208
'All five passengers died.'

30:26.291 --> 30:28.792
'And everyone blamed you.'

30:30.041 --> 30:33.917
To get to that level
and fail so publicly

30:34.000 --> 30:35.625
must have been devastating.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.917
You had to walk
away, to bury it.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.917
(Lilly)
'But all those years
later, along comes this'

30:41.000 --> 30:45.417
precocious, 14-year-old
boy. A whiz kid.

30:45.500 --> 30:48.041
And you let him in..

30:48.125 --> 30:51.208
...and he digs up
the one thing you buried.

30:51.291 --> 30:52.709
(Lilly)
'Confronts you.'

30:52.792 --> 30:57.250
You can't handle it...
'cause now you're a just a
liar.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.583
Right?

30:58.667 --> 31:01.417
You'd have to be perfect..

31:01.500 --> 31:03.125
...you know.

31:03.208 --> 31:06.500
A man in my position.

31:06.583 --> 31:09.375
Because if you mess up..

31:09.458 --> 31:12.375
...people die.

31:12.458 --> 31:14.625
And you lose everything.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.166
Augustine...did
you shoot Terrance

31:19.250 --> 31:21.125
up on that roof?

31:21.208 --> 31:22.959
He was caught in the middle.

31:24.166 --> 31:26.250
Being dragged down by people

31:26.333 --> 31:28.750
who didn't have his
best interests at
heart.

31:33.875 --> 31:35.166
Where you been?

31:35.250 --> 31:37.458
You haven't showed up
for class all week.

31:38.875 --> 31:41.458
'Back in the game, huh?'

31:41.542 --> 31:43.333
Got to make it out.
Only way how.

31:43.417 --> 31:45.208
Like your old man?

31:45.291 --> 31:47.166
Bumming around this block?

31:47.250 --> 31:48.417
Dice and card games

31:48.500 --> 31:51.291
till you wind up
in jail or shot?

31:51.375 --> 31:53.500
What you want from me?

31:55.000 --> 31:58.041
To start trying to use
your
brain for something
else.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.375
Create something
for once in your
life.

32:01.458 --> 32:03.500
Or you want to
wind up some loser

32:03.583 --> 32:05.834
kicking 'round
here till you
drop.

32:05.917 --> 32:09.166
What, like you?

32:09.250 --> 32:11.625
When you planning on telling me?

32:11.709 --> 32:14.583
You know, about the plane?

32:14.667 --> 32:16.959
The one that crashed?

32:18.959 --> 32:21.542
You're just like the rest
of 'em. And now look at you.

32:21.625 --> 32:23.667
You can barely
leave the building.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.333
Listen to you.

32:25.417 --> 32:28.166
Never even been off the block.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.458
At least I tried.

32:29.542 --> 32:31.583
Don't worry about me.

32:31.667 --> 32:33.500
Do the math, smart guy.

32:33.583 --> 32:35.291
They got a formula
for young black
males

32:35.375 --> 32:37.250
'round here, how
long you'll live.

32:37.333 --> 32:39.375
Guess we'll see.

32:41.792 --> 32:43.750
You're done wasting my time.

32:43.834 --> 32:46.375
You're gonna have to decide what
you're gonna do with your life.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.208
Already did.

32:49.834 --> 32:52.125
Got a game to play.

32:55.250 --> 32:57.250
Forced him to choose that night.

32:57.333 --> 32:59.417
Between you and the streets.

33:00.458 --> 33:02.834
Terrance was dead before dawn.

33:03.625 --> 33:05.709
Some big card game, huh?

33:05.792 --> 33:07.875
(Lilly)
'Big Fat Ray's?'

33:11.333 --> 33:13.625
Think Delonte
told a big fat lie.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.041
How about a hand of blackjack,
Delonte? Name your stakes.

33:23.875 --> 33:25.959
Nah, I don't gamble.

33:26.041 --> 33:29.000
That's right. You cheat and lie.

33:29.083 --> 33:31.750
Told us you dropped
Terrance after the break-in.

33:31.834 --> 33:35.750
But blackjack was your game
and Terrance could count cards.

33:35.834 --> 33:37.250
Whatever.

33:37.333 --> 33:40.208
Conjugal visitation's
off the table.

33:40.291 --> 33:43.417
Count on five more years
of making love to a sock.

33:43.500 --> 33:46.000
Try not to strip
all the bark off the wood.

33:46.083 --> 33:48.583
Nothing new. I'm a man.

33:48.667 --> 33:51.166
That's right.
Keep acting the big man.

33:51.250 --> 33:53.041
Like you still run the game.

33:53.125 --> 33:54.375
Tough to call the shots

33:54.458 --> 33:56.625
after you're transferred
to a supermax facility.

33:56.709 --> 34:00.208
You'd be in solitary
lockdown 23 hours a day.

34:00.291 --> 34:01.917
Kind of like veal.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.291
Except for that one hour where
they let you out to walk around

34:04.375 --> 34:06.458
that little concrete-walled pen.

34:06.542 --> 34:08.583
Just in case you
forgot you're in a zoo.

34:08.667 --> 34:10.792
No need to be
talking no supermax.

34:10.875 --> 34:13.792
But I throw you a bone
you got to give me something.

34:17.333 --> 34:20.500
Sorry, that's all
that's on the table.

34:22.834 --> 34:25.333
I brought the kid
to Fat Ray's Game.

34:25.417 --> 34:27.125
To count cards.

34:27.208 --> 34:29.959
I was the player.
Kid was the spotter.

34:30.041 --> 34:33.208
He'd watch the deck.
I'd watch the kid.

34:33.291 --> 34:34.792
He'd signal you?

34:34.875 --> 34:38.125
The count was low,
he'd cross his arm.

34:38.208 --> 34:41.375
The deck was high,
he'd touch his chin.

34:41.458 --> 34:42.667
'Simple.'

34:43.542 --> 34:45.625
I would've cut him in too.

34:45.709 --> 34:46.834
But what?

34:46.917 --> 34:48.959
Little man didn't
stick to the plan.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.166
Keep it coming, Ray.

34:55.750 --> 34:56.667
(Ray)
Fifteen.

35:13.291 --> 35:14.333
Double it up.

35:15.500 --> 35:16.625
'Hit me.'

35:18.083 --> 35:20.875
(Ray)
'And 5 makes 20.'

35:20.959 --> 35:22.583
- 'Busted.'
- Damn.

35:27.917 --> 35:31.208
Well, that leaves you, D.

35:31.291 --> 35:32.917
Taking a beat down tonight, Ray.

35:38.291 --> 35:41.041
- Give me another.
- Go on.

35:41.125 --> 35:43.250
I feel I'm
bringing
down the house.

35:49.208 --> 35:51.291
That's my boy right here.

35:52.792 --> 35:55.709
I've been watching
you do your thing.

35:55.792 --> 35:57.792
Smooth. Smooth.

35:57.875 --> 36:00.625
Say me and you take
a little trip this
weekend?

36:00.709 --> 36:02.834
Father, son,
Atlantic
City.

36:06.166 --> 36:09.041
What about Michael?

36:09.125 --> 36:12.291
Nah, this just me and you. The
tables won't know what hit 'em.

36:17.166 --> 36:19.583
♪ Nightmares first
deja vu

36:21.875 --> 36:23.667
Nah, I got school.

36:23.750 --> 36:26.166
Don't worry about that.

36:26.250 --> 36:29.625
Hey. You're my main man.

36:31.375 --> 36:33.333
Do your thing, boy.

37:04.542 --> 37:06.834
Bring it, big man. Hit me.

37:16.709 --> 37:18.583
[laughing]
25.

37:18.667 --> 37:21.125
(all)
'Oh-h-h!'

37:29.166 --> 37:31.750
He cost me a lot of bank.

37:31.834 --> 37:34.792
He "Punk'd" you.
That was unacceptable.

37:34.875 --> 37:37.875
Think what you want.
I ain't shoot that kid.

37:37.959 --> 37:40.041
Right, why would you do that

37:40.125 --> 37:42.083
when all you had to
do was order the
hit?

37:42.166 --> 37:44.375
You got somebody
to testify to that?

37:47.083 --> 37:48.834
I didn't think so.

37:50.458 --> 37:52.917
His half-brother was
there at the card game

37:53.000 --> 37:55.333
hanging with the 29th
Street crew bangers.

37:55.417 --> 37:57.917
- Michael.
- Kid was a wannabe.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.875
Still had to prove hisself.

37:59.959 --> 38:03.166
So you used Michael to
track
down Terrance to kill him.

38:03.250 --> 38:05.000
Michael knew the score.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.959
He wants to take it into
his own hands, so be it.

38:08.041 --> 38:10.250
Son of a bitch.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.750
But that ain't on me.
I didn't pull that trigger.

38:14.583 --> 38:16.917
Oh, yeah...there's
not a whole lot of

38:17.000 --> 38:18.375
natural light at supermax.

38:18.458 --> 38:19.709
We'll be sure to
send you a
postcard

38:19.792 --> 38:21.709
and let you know
what season it
is.

38:21.792 --> 38:24.166
Hey, what's up? We had a deal!

38:25.542 --> 38:27.583
You got somebody
to testify to that?

38:30.333 --> 38:32.375
Didn't think so.

38:39.291 --> 38:40.709
(Scotty)
'It's a real shame how you
got'

38:40.792 --> 38:43.000
'caught up in
the game, Michael.'

38:43.083 --> 38:45.458
(Lilly)
'Had to do Delonte's
bidding.'

38:45.542 --> 38:47.041
'Prove yourself.'

38:47.125 --> 38:52.208
(Scotty)
Uh. Thug life.
29th Street crew.

38:52.291 --> 38:54.291
That's just how it is out there.

38:54.375 --> 38:57.041
- 'You got to choose.'
- Choose what?

38:57.125 --> 39:00.000
Play or pray.
It was about survival.

39:00.083 --> 39:02.000
Terrance made his choice.

39:02.083 --> 39:04.500
That night at the card game.

39:04.583 --> 39:06.083
Wound up getting him killed.

39:06.166 --> 39:08.583
(Scotty)
'What were you
doing there, Michael?'

39:10.542 --> 39:13.250
Terrance was
your blood.

39:13.333 --> 39:16.166
But Delonte...
was your new family.

39:16.250 --> 39:19.250
We know he told you
to go after Terrance

39:19.333 --> 39:21.834
and you knew
where to find
him.

39:21.917 --> 39:24.417
Gang pretends
it's your family.

39:24.500 --> 39:25.583
You know?

39:25.667 --> 39:26.917
Guess you found out the hard way

39:27.000 --> 39:29.417
it's all...a bunch of bull.

39:30.583 --> 39:33.000
After I caught one in the back

39:33.083 --> 39:35.166
wound up whizzing in a bag.

39:36.625 --> 39:39.125
Guess they had no
use for me no more.

39:39.208 --> 39:42.792
None of them
cared.
Never did.

39:42.875 --> 39:44.500
Except T.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.917
He was my brother.
But he should've kept going.

39:51.333 --> 39:53.458
Never looked back.

39:57.208 --> 40:01.041
You know, I found him the one
place we always went to as
kids.

40:01.125 --> 40:02.667
The roof.

40:03.959 --> 40:06.083
Now why'd he go there?

40:08.000 --> 40:10.125
He came back for me.

40:13.208 --> 40:15.709
Time to fly, little buddy.

40:15.792 --> 40:17.917
(Michael)
'Why'd you do it, T?'

40:18.000 --> 40:20.834
- You messed up bad.
- Mike, listen..

40:20.917 --> 40:23.333
How we gonna get
Delonte's money back?

40:23.417 --> 40:24.917
We can't. We're not.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.667
- Screw Delonte.
- What?

40:26.750 --> 40:28.500
Screw dad. Screw all of 'em.

40:28.583 --> 40:30.542
Oh, you mean screw me too.

40:30.625 --> 40:32.208
Nah, don't you see?

40:32.291 --> 40:34.250
They ain't gonna do
nothin' but let you down.

40:34.333 --> 40:36.834
I don't get it, man. I
always
tried to look out for you.

40:36.917 --> 40:38.166
I know, that's why
I'm telling you we
got

40:38.250 --> 40:39.500
to get the hell
out of here,
Mike.

40:39.583 --> 40:41.583
And go where? And do what?

40:41.667 --> 40:44.458
I'm not worried.
We're smarter than all of
'em.

40:44.542 --> 40:48.417
See, that's 'cause you
got something special.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.083
'Everybody see that.'

40:50.875 --> 40:52.667
But this is all I got.

40:52.750 --> 40:55.625
- These four blocks.
- That's not true.

40:56.917 --> 41:00.667
But if we stay here...
going this way..

41:00.750 --> 41:02.875
...we'll die here.

41:05.709 --> 41:07.875
It's where we at now, T.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.125
You had a choice.

41:12.208 --> 41:14.291
But now you left me with none.

41:15.333 --> 41:16.959
Just come with me, Mike.

41:18.792 --> 41:20.834
'Let's get outta here.'

41:26.417 --> 41:28.250
Just come with me.

41:29.542 --> 41:31.750
'You shouldn't
have come back, T.'

41:32.792 --> 41:34.500
Don't do this, Mike.

41:34.583 --> 41:36.750
I'm sorry, T.

41:37.458 --> 41:39.917
You're my brother.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.208
See, you special.

41:42.291 --> 41:44.125
Don't do this, Mike.

41:44.208 --> 41:45.667
Me?

41:46.667 --> 41:48.500
I'm a nobody.
