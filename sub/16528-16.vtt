WEBVTT

00:00.034 --> 00:03.669
ADULT ADAM:<i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> we were all obsessed with</i>
<i> the movie</i> Karate Kid,

00:03.671 --> 00:07.239
<i> the tale of a misfit teenager</i>
<i> who teams up with Mr. Miyagi</i>

00:07.241 --> 00:09.208
<i> to crane-kick his way</i>
<i> to victory.</i>

00:09.210 --> 00:11.210
Wax on. Right.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.811
Wax off. Left.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.613
BOTH:
Wax on. Right hand.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.248
Wax off. Left hand.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.316
Wax on. Wax off.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.818
Shh. It's hard enough
to hear the old
karate gardener

00:19.820 --> 00:21.954
without you two morons
talking over him.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.789
<i> Yep, "Karate Kid"</i>
<i> had something for everyone.</i>

00:23.791 --> 00:27.159
Oh, man,
I loved how Daniel-san
beat up all those bullies.

00:27.161 --> 00:30.195
I mean, how many weeks
did he train? Three?
So cool.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.264
I loved the leg sweeping
and face punches.

00:32.266 --> 00:36.568
I loved the wise old man
kicking all those kids' butts.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.937
He should be arrested,
but he's not.

00:38.939 --> 00:39.738
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It even inspired me</i>

00:39.740 --> 00:43.008
<i> to write my very own</i>
<i> movie-review column</i>
<i> in the school newspaper.</i>

00:43.010 --> 00:44.243
Reading anything
good there, Taz?

00:44.245 --> 00:46.512
Yeah, man, this review of
<i> Karate Kid</i> is fresh.

00:46.514 --> 00:50.149
That other Adam Goldberg in
11th grade knows his movies.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.216
What? No.
I wrote that.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.218
It says here
it's by Adam Goldberg.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.119
You're
Adam F. Goldberg.

00:54.121 --> 00:59.558
ADULT ADAM:<i> With one missing</i>
<i> letter "F," my</i> Karate Kid
<i> journey began.</i>

00:59.560 --> 01:01.193
Oh, balls!

01:02.363 --> 01:03.662
You!
Oh, balls!

01:03.664 --> 01:08.600
<i> Balls, indeed. There he was,</i>
<i> the other Adam Goldberg.</i>

01:08.602 --> 01:11.003
<i> Indie, artsy,</i>
<i> and my nemesis</i>

01:11.005 --> 01:12.571
<i> who had been on my mind</i>
<i> a bit lately.</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:13.505
There's another
Adam Goldberg.

01:13.507 --> 01:14.840
There's another Adam Goldberg
in school.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.542
He's in 11th grade.
He's an actor, too.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.110
He's got more of
a Jim Jarmusch vibe.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.511
He's more of
a multi-hyphenate.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.212
He's a loose cannon.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.814
He's way more likely
to win an award than me.

01:21.816 --> 01:25.150
And he's very mad about
the whole same-name situation.

01:25.152 --> 01:26.652
He looks madder
than usual.

01:26.654 --> 01:30.389
He really does.
Thanks for having my back,
Taz.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.957
We need to talk,
Adam Goldberg.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.793
Oh, yeah, sure.
What's on your mind,
other Adam Goldberg?

01:34.795 --> 01:38.063
For the record,
you're the other
Adam Goldberg,

01:38.065 --> 01:39.098
and you're
ruining my rep.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.500
Everyone thinks I wrote
this hacky tripe.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.469
It's supposed to say
"Adam F."

01:43.471 --> 01:44.970
It's a simple mistake,
really.

01:44.972 --> 01:47.372
It's like that time
the nurse gave you my inhaler,

01:47.374 --> 01:48.707
even though you don't
have a problem with ragweed.

01:48.709 --> 01:52.611
Don't minimize this, bro.
Do you have any idea
how many people

01:52.613 --> 01:54.546
have congratulated me
on this article?

01:54.548 --> 01:56.515
Two?
Wow, that's a good guess.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.618
Point is, I'm tired
of the marketplace confusion!

01:59.620 --> 02:00.586
You got to change
your name now.

02:00.588 --> 02:04.556
I really don't think
people are gonna be confused
by our names, dude.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.892
Hey, Goldberg, we're playing
basketball in the gym,

02:06.894 --> 02:10.195
and your mother is insisting
you wear a jockstrap

02:10.197 --> 02:11.330
so you don't hurt
your yam bag.

02:11.332 --> 02:14.199
Ha! He's worried about
his reproductive health.

02:14.201 --> 02:17.469
His mom
cares about him!
That's a weakness!

02:17.671 --> 02:19.738
You're changing your name.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.939
(SIGHS)

02:20.941 --> 02:23.375
<i> ¶ You're the best around</i>

02:23.377 --> 02:25.077
<i> ¶ Nothin's gonna ever</i>
<i> keep you down ¶</i>

02:25.079 --> 02:29.581
ADULT ADAM:<i> It was March 1,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>
<i> and Erica was still obsessing</i>

02:29.583 --> 02:32.184
<i> over her first kiss</i>
<i> with Geoff Schwartz.</i>

02:32.186 --> 02:34.319
Hey.
Can we talk, you know,

02:34.321 --> 02:36.288
about that thing that
happened between us

02:36.290 --> 02:37.389
with our lips and stuff?

02:37.391 --> 02:38.423
I know the thing, Geoff.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.626
Well, even though
that thing was
super-awesome,

02:40.628 --> 02:42.528
it can't happen again
'cause, like,

02:42.530 --> 02:45.297
me and Evy are together.
You get it.

02:45.299 --> 02:45.931
Totally.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.534
It was a stupid
one-time mistake.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.206
A one-time mistake that...

02:54.208 --> 02:56.208
we've made every day...

02:56.210 --> 02:57.843
for the last three weeks.

02:57.845 --> 03:01.880
Right, but this is
the last time.
Starting now.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.815
God!
What is wrong with us?

03:03.817 --> 03:04.683
This has to stop!

03:04.685 --> 03:06.285
Does it? It does.
I don't know!

03:06.287 --> 03:08.787
Does it, though?
It doesn't!
And you know why?

03:08.789 --> 03:09.922
I'm gonna break up
with Evy today.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.356
Dude, you say that
exact same thing every day,

03:11.358 --> 03:13.892
and we always end up hiding
in here while Evy has
volleyball practice.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.161
You'll see. This time,
I won't get scared of her
and wimp out.

03:16.163 --> 03:20.799
Well, my lips aren't touching
yours until it's official.
Understood?

03:23.971 --> 03:26.138
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Erica and Geoff</i>
<i> were living in denial,</i>

03:26.140 --> 03:28.941
<i> I was living in fear</i>
<i> about my own name.</i>

03:28.943 --> 03:30.709
And so it's with
a heavy heart

03:30.711 --> 03:32.778
I must legally
change my name.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.279
Let's take a look
at option one.

03:34.281 --> 03:40.118
Examples of this might be
Snake, Blade, or Axel.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.753
Axel Goldberg?

03:41.755 --> 03:43.055
Moving on.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.423
We have the second option.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.391
I can be Adam Kenobi,

03:46.393 --> 03:50.429
Adam Balboa,
or Adam "Cobra" Commander.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.797
Or there's option three...

03:51.799 --> 03:55.300
Pick one of the names
I've carefully crafted
for you.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.836
Spazitron Spazzowitz.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.105
Nads Asshattington.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.740
(CHUCKLES)
Turd Smugglins.

04:01.742 --> 04:05.010
No! Who would name
their child Turd

04:05.012 --> 04:07.613
if their last name
was Smugglins?
Who?

04:07.615 --> 04:11.683
Damn it, you're still going on
about this stupid name thing?

04:11.685 --> 04:12.451
Dad's right.

04:12.453 --> 04:15.954
Stop running, and fight
for your name and honor.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.490
Fight? What fight?
There will be no fight.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.892
Stay out of this, Bevy.
I'm gonna deal with it.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.562
First, you bop that kid
in the nose.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.998
Then you hit him
with a chair.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.132
Why aren't you
writing this down?

04:27.134 --> 04:29.301
I think it's easier if I just
peacefully change my name

04:29.303 --> 04:33.639
'cause the other Adam Goldberg
is slightly inconvenienced
every so often.

04:33.641 --> 04:37.175
No way.
Your name is perfect,
just like you.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.610
Mama will take care of this.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.045
Absolutely not.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.813
You go tattle-taling
to your mama,

04:41.815 --> 04:43.815
it's only gonna
make things worse.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.416
Okay, fine.

04:44.418 --> 04:48.587
I promise I won't speak
to the other Adam Goldberg

04:48.589 --> 04:50.389
at all, in any way.

04:50.391 --> 04:53.225
Your mom called my mom
last night, dude.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.293
What is wrong with you?

04:54.295 --> 04:55.661
Damn it!
She found a loophole.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.796
She convinced my mom
that I should go by AJ

04:57.798 --> 04:59.431
'cause my middle name's
Jacob. AJ.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.033
Relax.
No one's calling you AJ.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.602
Hey, everybody,
the pretentious film
nerd's gonna go by AJ

05:03.604 --> 05:06.938
so we can tell the
difference between him
and the mainstream film nerd.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.775
Your name's
just letters!
You suck, AJ!

05:09.777 --> 05:11.843
That's it. I was just gonna
make you change your name,

05:11.845 --> 05:13.445
but now I'm gonna beat
the crap out of you

05:13.447 --> 05:14.746
and make you
change your name!

05:14.748 --> 05:15.714
Let's say you
didn't beat me up,

05:15.716 --> 05:19.384
and I became a
Mr. Turd Smugglins.
Would that appeal to you?

05:19.386 --> 05:21.453
No.
Be in the quad at 3:00.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.522
ADULT ADAM:<i> While I was forced</i>
<i> to face my nemesis,</i>

05:23.524 --> 05:26.825
<i> Erica was suddenly</i>
<i> feeling bad for hers.</i>

05:26.827 --> 05:28.427
Evy, hey.

05:28.962 --> 05:29.828
You...okay?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.596
(VOICE BREAKING) I'm fine.
You sure?

05:31.598 --> 05:33.598
Something bad didn't
happen to you,

05:33.600 --> 05:35.467
like a paper cut
or a nasty break-up?

05:35.469 --> 05:37.936
I think something's going on
between me and Geoffrey.

05:37.938 --> 05:41.473
Geoffrey...
the Toys R' Us giraffe?

05:41.475 --> 05:42.908
Schwartz!

05:42.910 --> 05:46.712
I mean, I know
I can be kind of smothering,

05:46.714 --> 05:50.482
but that's only because
I like him so much.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.884
Um, it's gonna be fine.

05:52.886 --> 05:53.985
You'll be fine.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.221
Um, maybe not fine.

05:56.957 --> 05:57.923
Life will move on.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.092
Erica,
you told her about us?

06:00.094 --> 06:01.460
Um, no.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.294
What about you guys?

06:02.296 --> 06:04.329
What? No!
Nothing romantic
is going on

06:04.331 --> 06:06.898
while you're at volleyball
practice between
3:30 and 5:00.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.700
Stop using
so many specifics, Geoff!

06:08.702 --> 06:11.236
All I'm saying is we were
definitely not damaging

06:11.238 --> 06:13.004
some wind chimes
in a moment of passion.

06:13.006 --> 06:13.939
Geoff!
I'm so sorry!

06:13.941 --> 06:16.074
Anxiety makes me
get extremely detailed!

06:16.076 --> 06:19.378
Well, anger makes me
throw stuff at cheating jerks!

06:19.980 --> 06:20.812
Ha!
(LAUGHS)

06:20.814 --> 06:22.547
You got a face full
of orange drink!

06:22.549 --> 06:23.648
It's fun 'cause
you're sticky now!

06:23.650 --> 06:27.119
Dear Lord, are you two
always just lurking around
to bag on people?

06:27.121 --> 06:30.322
For sure.
It makes me feel better
about myself.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.158
Barry!
I never thought
I'd say this,

06:33.160 --> 06:35.594
but I need your street smarts
and karate skills.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.962
It's one-stop shopping
with me. Continue.

06:36.964 --> 06:40.799
The other Adam Goldberg
says he's gonna beat me
into a pulp after school.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.468
You got to save me.
Don't worry, bro.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.070
I know just what to do.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.773
As you know, it is strictly
against school policy

06:47.775 --> 06:51.176
to allow students to fight
on school property.

06:51.178 --> 06:51.910
Oh, thank God.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.179
Which is why I'm allowing
your brother here

06:54.181 --> 06:57.883
to start an official
after-school karate club.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.918
What?
BARRY: Look,
I already signed you up.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.219
I thought you were
going to save me.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.222
I am, by letting
the other Adam Goldberg

07:04.224 --> 07:07.025
kick your ass
in a loving, controlled,

07:07.027 --> 07:08.693
school-sanctioned
environment

07:08.695 --> 07:11.329
monitored by our
most lenient teacher.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.665
Karate club, huh?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.667
Too afraid to fight me
on the streets?

07:15.669 --> 07:17.869
Yes! I've mentioned that
several times.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.237
Then I'll beat you down
on the mat,

07:19.239 --> 07:21.573
even though we both know
you'll wuss out.

07:21.575 --> 07:21.940
Friday.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.544
I'm kicking butts
and taking names.
Literally.

07:26.447 --> 07:27.612
Thanks a lot, Barry.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.215
You officially just
signed my death warrant.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.884
Chill out. I got a plan.

07:32.886 --> 07:38.356
The time has come
for you to meet my sensei.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.526
What the hell?
Is it Thanksgiving
already?

07:41.528 --> 07:43.995
No. You've got
a new student.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.831
Uncle Marvin is your sensei?

07:45.833 --> 07:50.035
Hai! Will you train
the lazy-eyed one, master?

07:50.037 --> 07:50.702
Hai.

07:50.704 --> 07:51.803
But be forewarned,
Adam-san.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.638
You must always keep
your focus sharp.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.807
You must not give in
to distractions.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.609
And if anyone should walk
in here and say,

07:57.611 --> 08:00.245
"Get out of my apartment,"
what do we say, Barry-san?

08:00.247 --> 08:01.847
I've got squatters rights.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.615
Excellent, my pupil.
Excellent.

08:03.617 --> 08:07.018
ADULT ADAM:
<i> I always knew my crazy uncle</i>
<i> was a man of many talents,</i>

08:07.020 --> 08:09.821
<i> but I never realized</i>
<i> until that very moment</i>

08:09.823 --> 08:11.556
<i> that karate was one of them.</i>

08:11.558 --> 08:12.824
Soap the counter.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.260
Rinse the counter.
Hai!

08:15.262 --> 08:16.528
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And just like Mr. Miyagi,</i>

08:16.530 --> 08:20.532
<i> he used household chores</i>
<i> to teach me the art of karate.</i>

08:20.534 --> 08:22.400
Wash the dishes! Hai!

08:22.402 --> 08:24.469
Scrape out that freezer!

08:24.471 --> 08:26.404
Give me that juice!

08:26.406 --> 08:27.772
(GRUMBLES)

08:27.774 --> 08:29.808
Cheese my quesadilla!

08:29.810 --> 08:30.375
(GRUMBLES)

08:30.377 --> 08:33.311
Look in the neighbor's
trash for cans!

08:33.313 --> 08:34.579
Good!

08:34.581 --> 08:35.514
Good!

08:35.516 --> 08:38.216
Shred my eight-year-old
tax returns!

08:38.218 --> 08:39.751
Hai!

08:40.220 --> 08:41.019
Hai!

08:41.021 --> 08:42.020
Take this old TV
to the curb!

08:42.022 --> 08:45.223
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Yes, I was becoming</i>
<i> a martial-arts master.</i>

08:45.225 --> 08:47.759
I'm learning
so much karate.
Hai!

08:47.761 --> 08:50.462
ADULT ADAM:<i> At least</i>
<i> that's what he told me.</i>

08:51.164 --> 08:54.766
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Thanks to Uncle Marvin,</i>
<i> I was almost ready for battle.</i>

08:54.768 --> 08:55.700
<i> I just needed permission.</i>

08:55.702 --> 08:58.703
I need you to sign
my permission slip
for the Karate Club.

08:58.705 --> 09:02.007
I shall face my enemy
in open combat.

09:02.009 --> 09:02.841
Look at you.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.776
Finally listening
to your old man, huh?

09:04.778 --> 09:06.111
No, your stuff
was useless.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.380
I'm being trained
by the most deadly

09:08.382 --> 09:10.749
martial-arts sensei
in town.

09:10.751 --> 09:11.750
Observe.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.919
Wah!
Spray TV.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.453
Wipe TV.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.789
Spray TV.
Wipe TV.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.791
I don't know
what the hell that was,

09:19.793 --> 09:22.761
but good for you
for defending yourself

09:22.763 --> 09:24.396
and for cleaning my TV.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.631
Stay still, Lucky.
Thank you. There we go.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.466
ADULT ADAM:<i> I was officially</i>
<i> ready for battle.</i>

09:28.468 --> 09:31.336
<i> Meanwhile, Erica and Geoff</i>
<i> were finally official.</i>

09:31.338 --> 09:32.604
So you guys
must feel great

09:32.606 --> 09:34.472
not having to hide
your love anymore.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.840
Yeah, it's, like,
the best.

09:35.842 --> 09:40.045
Yeah, you know,
except for... that.

09:41.648 --> 09:44.015
Look at her.
She is a crazy person.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.518
Seriously.
She's gone
full Zabka on us.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.552
Gone what?
Billy Zabka?

09:47.554 --> 09:49.254
The dude who played
the bad guy in<i> Karate Kid.</i>

09:49.256 --> 09:52.257
He got dumped
by Elisabeth Shue
and couldn't get over it.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.459
Not taking sides,
but it really seems like

09:54.461 --> 09:56.461
you guys are the Zabka
in this situation.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.663
Yeah, you're clearly
the bad guys.
Mmm-hmm.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.966
Us? Come on, man.
How can you even say that?

10:00.968 --> 10:02.500
There's no way
that we're the Zabkas.

10:02.502 --> 10:05.170
ADULT ADAM:<i> Wrong.</i>
<i> That night, Geoff went home</i>

10:05.172 --> 10:06.371
<i> and watched a movie marathon.</i>

10:06.373 --> 10:08.940
We're totally the Zabkas.
Okay, what is happening?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.475
I just watched
every Zabka movie.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.777
<i> Karate Kid.</i>
Zabka snap-kicks Daniel,

10:12.779 --> 10:14.346
who was just handing Ali
back her radio.

10:14.348 --> 10:17.349
<i> Back to School.</i>
Zabka punches
Rodney Dangerfield.

10:17.351 --> 10:18.617
He punches an old man
in the face.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.586
<i> Just One of the Guys.</i>
Zabka throws a girl
in the ocean.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.555
She was just trying
to succeed as a photographer.

10:23.557 --> 10:26.024
Hey! Terry lied to everybody
about who she was,

10:26.026 --> 10:28.193
until she told him the truth
with her boobs.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.095
I'm Geoff Schwartz, man.
I can't be the Zabka.

10:30.097 --> 10:34.099
I'm the sweet, lovable,
girl-next-door type.
I'm the Elisabeth Shue.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.800
Well, I am not
the Zabka here.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.403
Whoa! Are you saying
I'm the solo Zabka here?

10:38.405 --> 10:39.137
Evy is your girlfriend.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.240
You said you were
going to break up with her,
but you didn't.

10:42.242 --> 10:42.707
Total Zabka move.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.677
Okay, you're being
a major Zabka right now,
and I don't like it.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.246
Don't you call me
a Zabka, Zabka!

10:48.248 --> 10:50.315
Ha! Only a Zabka
would call a Zabka a Zabka!

10:50.317 --> 10:54.486
Well, if I'm such
a freaking Zabka,
then get out, you Zabka!

10:55.188 --> 10:58.223
We're still gonna make out
in your brother's
tree house later, right?

10:58.225 --> 11:00.058
Obviously!
We're such Zabkas!

11:00.060 --> 11:01.559
I know!

11:02.162 --> 11:02.827
Listen up.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.097
The next phase of our training
begins tomorrow.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.133
You will power-wash
the driveway,

11:08.135 --> 11:09.601
like a true Shinobi warrior.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.670
Um, I can't wait
till tomorrow.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.739
(CHUCKLES)
I'd rather not wait,
either, grasshopper,

11:14.741 --> 11:16.341
but I have to rent
the power washer

11:16.343 --> 11:18.343
from the hardware store.
It's a whole thing.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.045
No, I have
the tournament tomorrow.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.179
The tournament...
hai... the what?

11:21.181 --> 11:23.448
Tomorrow's the big day
where Adam squares off

11:23.450 --> 11:26.551
against his same-name nemesis,
his namesis.

11:26.553 --> 11:27.318
Wait a minute,
are you telling me

11:27.320 --> 11:29.854
that someone's gonna
put their hands on you
for real-skis?

11:29.856 --> 11:30.488
Fear not, Sensei.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.858
Once you show me
how the chores
become karate moves,

11:33.860 --> 11:35.226
I shall not fail.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.795
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

11:36.797 --> 11:37.729
Okay, here's the deal.

11:37.731 --> 11:42.767
Um, technically,
I'm not so much
of a karate expert

11:42.769 --> 11:45.537
as I am a guy
whose housekeeper quit

11:45.539 --> 11:49.574
because he tried
to pay her with "massage."

11:49.576 --> 11:50.108
Oh, my God.

11:50.110 --> 11:53.111
(EXCLAIMS) What are you
saying right now?

11:53.113 --> 11:55.914
All we've done is clean
this slob's apartment!

11:55.916 --> 12:00.185
I must unleash my anger
through karate!

12:00.587 --> 12:02.420
Oh, God. (SOBBING)

12:02.422 --> 12:06.124
This is all I know.
What am I?

12:06.126 --> 12:10.128
Uncle Marvin, I have a battle
to the death tomorrow.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.029
What am I going to do?

12:11.031 --> 12:14.032
Okay, okay, okay.
I still can teach you
one technique.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.968
It's called duck
and curl up into a ball.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.169
Watch and learn.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.172
(WHIMPERING)

12:21.475 --> 12:22.440
Ah-ha!

12:22.442 --> 12:23.875
I just figured it out.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.877
You're trying
to shake my faith.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.412
This is all a test.

12:27.414 --> 12:27.879
It is?

12:27.881 --> 12:30.915
Of course I'm a 10th degree
black belt.

12:30.917 --> 12:31.583
I have to be.

12:31.585 --> 12:34.252
Otherwise,
reality as I know it
would implode,

12:34.254 --> 12:38.556
and I'd find myself
in a deep darkness
and never fully recover.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.524
Oh, man.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.458
Back to training!

12:40.460 --> 12:41.292
ADULT ADAM:
<i> My fate was sealed.</i>

12:41.294 --> 12:45.230
<i> But little did I know,</i>
<i> there was a warrior still</i>
<i> out there fighting for me.</i>

12:45.232 --> 12:47.332
I demand you shut down
the Karate Club.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.200
Woof!
You're awfully worked up.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.136
Must be a handful
at home, huh?

12:51.138 --> 12:52.670
You think?
You do realize

12:52.672 --> 12:54.305
Adam shouldn't even be
in this club?

12:54.307 --> 12:57.842
You know, there's gonna be
teachers and mats
and referees.

12:57.844 --> 13:02.947
This is literally
the easiest way for Adam
to take on a bully.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.016
Well, then,
you leave me no choice.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.584
(TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYS)

13:06.586 --> 13:10.355
I am entering
the karate tournament.

13:10.357 --> 13:13.057
(MUSIC DIES)
No, you're an adult.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.759
Oh, yeah, that's right.

<i> Thanks to her,</i>
<i> I'd fight someone</i>

13:32.379 --> 13:38.416
First match,
Adam F. Goldberg
vs. Big Tasty.

13:38.418 --> 13:42.187
I don't remember
arranging that,
but it's on the big board,

13:42.189 --> 13:43.855
so let's do this!

13:43.857 --> 13:44.856
(CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

13:44.858 --> 13:47.525
Mama, did you do this
wonderful thing for me?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.794
I'm always
on your side, boopie.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.095
(CHUCKLES)

13:52.732 --> 13:53.431
Take him out.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.899
Are you telling me
to sweep the leg?

13:54.901 --> 13:57.335
If he wins, he has to face
the other Adam Goldberg.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.237
I want my schmoo
out of commission.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.939
But then
I'll get disqualified.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.408
Show no mercy.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.010
You hear me?
Sweep the leg.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.146
Wait, why did Mom yell,
"Sweep the leg"?

14:08.148 --> 14:09.914
Eh, no reason.
Sweep the leggy.

14:09.916 --> 14:10.882
Are you gonna
sweep my leg?

14:10.884 --> 14:12.650
Eh.
Sweep the leggy, sweetie.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.319
You are!
You're gonna sweep my leg!

14:14.321 --> 14:15.253
Sweep the leggy!

14:15.255 --> 14:15.787
Do not sweep the leg!

<i> Barry would listen to my mom</i>
<i> and sweep the leg.</i>

How could you
let this happen?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.677
I'm sorry.
I had a brilliant plan

14:39.679 --> 14:40.745
to get you
a little bit hurt

14:40.747 --> 14:42.780
so you wouldn't have
to fight the other Adam

14:42.782 --> 14:43.982
and get very hurt.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.917
That is so...

14:46.720 --> 14:47.986
Genius!

14:47.988 --> 14:49.954
I'm gonna hug your body!

14:49.956 --> 14:51.155

Hey, your leg's better.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.259
Yeah, it was just a kick.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.827
Barry usually
hurts me way worse.

14:55.829 --> 14:56.995
Yesterday he threw me
out of a tree.

Okay, well, this, uh,
faking your way
out of this fight,

15:00.133 --> 15:01.466

little secret.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.669
Hey, Dad. Bad news.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.804
Got my leg swept.

15:06.806 --> 15:07.171
Fight's off.

15:07.173 --> 15:10.108
But thanks for finally coming
to one of my school things.

15:10.110 --> 15:10.975
Looks fine to me.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.644
Well, let's not
dig too deep.

15:12.646 --> 15:14.579
The point is
my baby is safe.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.848
Listen, I want to
tell you a story.

15:16.850 --> 15:17.949
Forget it!
I don't want to hear

15:17.951 --> 15:20.118
how you bopped a bully
in the nose!

15:20.120 --> 15:22.553
Adam, I was the bully.

15:22.555 --> 15:26.224
I was an unhappy kid,
and I took it out
on other people.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.792
And you know
when I stopped?

15:27.794 --> 15:32.330
When a kid
was brave enough
to bop me back.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.566
I thought you could be
that kid.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.701
I guess I was wrong.

15:36.703 --> 15:37.368
<i> ¶ Tonight it's very clear</i>

15:37.370 --> 15:40.004
ADULT ADAM:<i> In that moment,</i>
<i> my dad made me realize</i>

15:40.006 --> 15:41.172
<i> I could no longer</i>
<i> run and hide.</i>

15:41.174 --> 15:42.240
<i> ¶ 'Cause we're both</i>
<i> lying here...</i>

15:42.242 --> 15:46.044
<i> And that day,</i>
<i> my sister realized</i>
<i> she couldn't hide the truth.</i>

15:46.046 --> 15:49.247
<i> She knew in her heart</i>
<i> she didn't want to be</i>
<i> the bad guy.</i>

15:49.249 --> 15:54.419
<i> As hard as it was,</i>
<i> she did the one thing</i>
<i> she thought she never would.</i>

15:54.421 --> 15:57.221
I can't believe
this is happening.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.058
I'm sorry, Geoff.

16:00.060 --> 16:03.127
I thought being with you was
the only thing that mattered,

16:03.129 --> 16:04.662
but now I'm not so sure.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.165
But we're supposed
to be together.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.199
Not this way.

16:08.201 --> 16:12.437
We don't want to
start our relationship
by hurting someone else.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.404
Then when?

16:13.406 --> 16:15.473
Not until it feels right.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.809
(SIGHS) I'm such an idiot.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.510
I've known you for 10 years,

16:19.512 --> 16:21.779
and the timing
has never been right.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.181
Someday.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.615
Hopefully.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.695
It's time to stop running

16:37.697 --> 16:40.365
and face the other
Adam Goldberg
once and for all.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.567
But you can't.
You have a slight limp.

16:42.569 --> 16:46.137
If Daniel-san can fight
with a messed-up leg,
so can I!

16:46.139 --> 16:50.108
Daniel-san also had
his sensei by his side.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.275
And so shall you.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.276
Uncle Marvin, you came!

16:52.278 --> 16:56.381
I wasn't about to abandon
my star pupil in his time
of need.

16:56.383 --> 17:01.119
Also, Bevy,
I need to borrow $8,300.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.086
More on that later.

17:02.088 --> 17:04.022
Let's focus on that leg.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.556
(HUMMING)

17:05.558 --> 17:08.359
He's gonna use
the ancient wisdom of
the Orient to save me.

17:08.361 --> 17:12.730
What? Oh, no, I was just
trying to think of a way
for you to win this thing.

17:12.732 --> 17:13.931
(HUMMING)

17:13.933 --> 17:15.600
I got nothing.
You're a dead man.

17:15.602 --> 17:16.267
BEVERLY: Out of my way.

17:16.269 --> 17:20.338
Look, Schmoo, all I ever
wanted to do was protect you,

17:20.340 --> 17:22.073
but maybe this time,

17:22.075 --> 17:24.142
protecting you actually
hurts you in the end.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.577
Does that mean you're okay
with Karate Club?

17:26.579 --> 17:27.512
Oh, God, no.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.248
I'll never stop
worrying about you.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.916
But this is your battle.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.551
And if you need to
fight for your honor,

17:33.553 --> 17:36.187
then you fight with
everything you've got.

17:36.322 --> 17:36.687
I will, Mama.

17:36.689 --> 17:40.458
(VOICE BREAKING)
Now go be a man,
my delicious little baby boy.

17:41.127 --> 17:47.131
<i> ¶ I am a man who will fight</i>
<i> for your honor ¶</i>

17:47.133 --> 17:50.701
Last chance to give up,
Gold Nerd. Ha!

17:50.703 --> 17:52.470
Know what, other Adam?

17:52.472 --> 17:53.905
I've had enough of this!

17:53.907 --> 17:56.974
Who cares about
marketplace confusion?

17:56.976 --> 17:58.342
We're not that important!

17:58.344 --> 18:02.013
No one gives a crap
about us but us!

18:02.015 --> 18:02.480
Let's do this!

ADULT ADAM:
<i> Yep, it was time to go</i>
<i> get my ass kicked</i>

18:05.618 --> 18:06.984
<i> in front of everyone.</i>

18:06.986 --> 18:08.553
Yeah, here's the thing.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.422
I technically don't know
how to, uh...

18:11.424 --> 18:12.790
(MUSIC DIES)
...fight.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.892
What?
But you said you did.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.194
It's called acting, bro.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.462
I was certain
you'd wuss out.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.330
Really bit me
in the ass here.

18:19.332 --> 18:19.797
This is horrible!

18:19.799 --> 18:22.100
We're gonna embarrass
ourselves in front
of the whole school.

18:22.102 --> 18:25.136
I know. It's like a nightmare
version of<i> Karate Kid.</i>

18:25.138 --> 18:26.571
Wait, you saw the movie?

18:26.573 --> 18:27.972
I thought you hate
big studio fare?

18:27.974 --> 18:30.675
Eh, after I read your review,
I gave it a shot.

18:30.677 --> 18:31.375
You're an okay writer.

18:31.377 --> 18:34.545
Not good enough for books.
Maybe sitcoms or something.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.179
Thanks.

18:35.181 --> 18:38.649
Look, I... I really am sorry
about all the confusion.

18:38.651 --> 18:42.120
Truth is, I'm a huge fan
of your work.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.055
I've always
looked up to you.

18:44.190 --> 18:47.391
I just want to be friends.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.493
Cool.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.627
None of this changes the fact

18:49.629 --> 18:51.195
that we're about
to bomb out there.

18:51.197 --> 18:53.431
Wait a minute,
we both do school theater,

18:53.433 --> 18:56.868
we both know stage combat,
and we both know<i> Karate Kid.</i>

18:56.870 --> 18:58.136
So?
So what do you say

18:58.138 --> 19:01.772
we go out there and give
those people a real show?

19:01.774 --> 19:03.808
It's showtime!

19:03.810 --> 19:06.344
I mean, aah!
Aah!

19:06.346 --> 19:07.078
Hyah!
Aah!

19:07.080 --> 19:10.281
All right, the moment
we've been waiting for.
