-Lucifer is not God.
-God isn't God anymore.

36:13.254 --> 36:17.507
He doesn't care what we do.
I am proof of that.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.426
But this?

36:23.431 --> 36:24.973
What were you gonna do, Uriel?

36:25.308 --> 36:28.310
Were you gonna kill the whole garrison?

36:28.477 --> 36:30.770
I only killed the ones who said no.

36:33.107 --> 36:35.066
Others have joined me, Cass.

36:35.568 --> 36:38.695
Now, please, brother, don't fight me.

36:39.238 --> 36:41.031
Help me.

36:42.158 --> 36:45.035
Help me spread the word.

36:45.411 --> 36:48.121
Help me bring on the apocalypse.

36:50.833 --> 36:53.126
All you have to do...

36:53.628 --> 36:55.921
...is be unafraid.

37:01.886 --> 37:05.639
For the first time in a long time...

37:08.643 --> 37:09.768
...I am.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.731
[GRUNTING]

37:45.012 --> 37:47.430
You can't win, Uriel.

37:47.598 --> 37:48.974
I still serve God.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.393
You haven't even met the man.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.855
There is no will.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.525
No wrath.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.239
No God.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.157
[GRUNTS]

38:07.868 --> 38:11.329
Maybe or maybe not...

38:11.497 --> 38:14.457
...but there's still me.

38:17.044 --> 38:18.378
Aah.

[SCREAMS]

38:52.204 --> 38:54.122
CASTIEL:
Are you all right?

39:00.129 --> 39:01.755
No thanks to you.

39:07.261 --> 39:08.928
You need to be more careful.

39:09.597 --> 39:12.932
You need to learn how to manage
a damn devil's trap.

39:13.309 --> 39:15.518
That's not what I mean.

39:17.271 --> 39:18.772
Uriel is dead.

39:20.941 --> 39:24.444
-Was it the demons?
-It was disobedience.

39:26.614 --> 39:29.199
He was working against us.

39:34.330 --> 39:35.955
Is it true?

39:39.126 --> 39:41.294
Did I break the first seal?

39:43.130 --> 39:45.048
Did I start all this?

39:47.051 --> 39:48.468
Yes.

39:50.638 --> 39:54.974
When we discovered
Lilith's plan for you...

39:55.976 --> 39:58.311
...we laid siege to hell...

39:58.896 --> 40:01.564
...and we fought our way to get to you
before you--

40:01.732 --> 40:03.566
Jump-started the apocalypse.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.904
And we were too late.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.158
Why didn't you just leave me there, then?

40:12.827 --> 40:17.080
It's not blame that falls on you, Dean...

40:18.749 --> 40:20.708
...it's fate.

40:23.838 --> 40:27.382
The righteous man who begins it...

40:28.551 --> 40:31.678
...is the only one who can finish it.

40:34.890 --> 40:37.183
You have to stop it.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.813
Lucifer?

40:43.691 --> 40:45.817
The apocalypse?

40:48.904 --> 40:50.363
What does that mean?

40:55.202 --> 40:56.786
Hey.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.831
Don't you go disappearing on me,
you son of a bitch.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.207
What does that mean?

41:01.542 --> 41:03.293
-I don't know.
-Bull.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.211
I don't.

41:06.755 --> 41:09.340
Dean, they don't tell me much.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.968
I know...

41:12.470 --> 41:15.388
...our fate rests with you.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.809
[VOICE BREAKING]
Well, then you guys are screwed.

41:21.020 --> 41:25.398
I can't do it, Cass. It's too big.

41:25.566 --> 41:29.235
Alastair was right. I'm not all here.

41:29.403 --> 41:31.905
I'm not strong enough.

41:40.498 --> 41:44.125
Well, I guess I'm not the man
either of our dads wanted me to be.

41:49.089 --> 41:51.299
Find someone else.

41:53.469 --> 41:54.844
It's not me.
