WEBVTT

00:06.467 --> 00:13.867
* I lost my keys
in the great unknown... *

00:13.933 --> 00:16.667
[woman]:
I moved to Washington state

00:16.733 --> 00:18.667
a little over a year ago,

00:18.733 --> 00:20.000
hoping that I'd find Mr. Right

00:20.067 --> 00:22.567
and he would sweep me
off my feet.

00:22.633 --> 00:24.033
At this small congregation

00:24.100 --> 00:25.800
known as
"church of the Shepherd,"

00:25.867 --> 00:27.733
love is all around.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.433
[***]

00:30.500 --> 00:31.867
Marriage
is a lifetime commitment

00:31.933 --> 00:33.700
I've always wanted.

00:34.567 --> 00:36.233
I wonder, will I ever be

00:36.300 --> 00:38.933
on the receiving end
of the wedding vows?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.167
A deep connection

00:40.233 --> 00:41.400
through all
the slings and arrows

00:41.467 --> 00:44.067
of outrageous fortune.

00:44.133 --> 00:46.000
No more loneliness.

00:46.067 --> 00:48.500
No more isolation.

00:48.567 --> 00:51.433
I give you this ring
as a symbol of my love.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.533
A 30-year-old single minister
lives in dating Siberia.

00:56.567 --> 01:00.500
I give you this ring
as a symbol of my love.

01:03.067 --> 01:05.167
The wedding ring

01:05.233 --> 01:07.733
is a symbol
of the enduring promises

01:07.800 --> 01:11.167
that Dan and Stacy
have made on this day.

01:11.233 --> 01:13.500
In as much
as you have exchanged your vows

01:13.567 --> 01:14.767
and your rings,

01:14.833 --> 01:17.233
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

01:17.300 --> 01:21.300
What god has brought together
let no one take apart.

01:22.900 --> 01:24.800
Dan, you may kiss your bride.

01:27.067 --> 01:28.133
* in the middle
of my little mess *

01:28.200 --> 01:29.967
* I forget
how big I'm blessed *

01:30.067 --> 01:34.700
* this is the stuff
that gets under my skin *

01:34.767 --> 01:36.867
* but I've gotta trust *

01:36.933 --> 01:39.267
* you know exactly
what you're doing *

01:39.333 --> 01:41.767
* might not be
what I would choose *

01:41.833 --> 01:44.967
* but this is the stuff
you use *

01:45.067 --> 01:47.600
the kiss starts to take on
biblical proportions.

01:47.667 --> 01:51.100
Finally, they come up for air
and I can present them.

01:51.167 --> 01:53.600
* I've got a new appreciation *

01:53.667 --> 01:57.733
* it's not
the end of the world *

01:57.800 --> 02:00.067
[classical music playing]

02:01.867 --> 02:04.200
Nother wedding reception solo,a

02:04.267 --> 02:06.067
but this is the last one.

02:06.067 --> 02:07.400
Soon, I'll be free.

02:13.933 --> 02:17.700
[***]

02:17.767 --> 02:19.233
I've learned the hard way

02:19.300 --> 02:20.900
that I don't belong
in the ministry.

02:24.967 --> 02:25.900
[Applause]

02:25.967 --> 02:27.200
You did a fine job

02:27.267 --> 02:28.800
filling in for
reverend black.

02:28.867 --> 02:30.800
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Sanderson.

02:30.867 --> 02:33.133
A nice girl like you
ought to be married by now.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.967
Aren't you sweet?

02:36.067 --> 02:38.667
You know, next week
is Valentine's day.

02:38.733 --> 02:39.500
Do you have a date?

02:39.567 --> 02:41.100
No. Not yet.

02:43.867 --> 02:45.133
[Applause]

02:45.200 --> 02:48.067
The strange reality
of being a minister

02:48.067 --> 02:49.400
is that your life

02:49.467 --> 02:51.233
becomes the business
of your congregation.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.967
They have a stake in you.

02:53.067 --> 02:55.600
If you mess up,
it reflects on them,

02:55.667 --> 02:56.833
so you go through your days

02:56.900 --> 02:59.733
in a sort of
behavioral straitjacket

02:59.800 --> 03:01.767
that keeps you
from traumatizing yourself

03:01.833 --> 03:03.733
or anyone else.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.633
I'll be glad
to leave that behind.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.200
Take it easy, hart.

03:10.267 --> 03:12.067
People will think
you're up to something.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.133
Mrs. Sanderson,

03:14.200 --> 03:18.100
this is
reverend David swenson,

03:18.167 --> 03:20.233
one of my best friends
from divinity school.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.067
-Nice to meet you.
-As well.

03:22.067 --> 03:23.367
I haven't told David

03:23.433 --> 03:25.233
about my decision
to leave the ministry.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.867
He's not going to like it.

03:26.933 --> 03:28.067
Nice job
on the nuptials.

03:28.133 --> 03:29.167
Thanks.

03:29.233 --> 03:30.633
Do they let
the associate minister

03:30.700 --> 03:33.200
do many weddings over there
at the church for the sheep?

03:33.267 --> 03:35.200
Ha-ha. Very funny.

03:35.267 --> 03:37.967
I'm just a temporary fill-in
for reverend black.

03:38.067 --> 03:38.867
Ah, yes,

03:38.933 --> 03:40.367
reverend black's
golf injury.

03:40.433 --> 03:42.100
And how goes the recovery
for the good reverend?

03:42.167 --> 03:43.967
Doing very well, actually.

03:44.067 --> 03:46.067
He'll be back next week.
What are you doing here?

03:46.067 --> 03:47.833
The bride's folks

03:47.900 --> 03:50.300
are members of the congregation
at St. Helga's.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.067
And...

03:52.067 --> 03:53.367
It's a good thing for you
that I'm here,

03:53.433 --> 03:57.300
because I might be
the only person under 70

03:57.367 --> 03:59.067
to ask you to dance.

03:59.067 --> 04:00.233
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

04:00.300 --> 04:01.233
Yeah, as I recall

04:01.300 --> 04:02.367
your waltz is

04:02.433 --> 04:03.567
a criminal offense
in 10 states. Hey!

04:04.967 --> 04:06.200
That's assault, swenson.

04:06.267 --> 04:08.833
Then you're going to have
to have me arrested?

04:08.900 --> 04:09.767
Come on.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.067
So how was your date?

04:20.067 --> 04:22.067
It was great,

04:22.100 --> 04:26.167
until I was forced to reveal
what I did for a living.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.300
She kept looking at me
like I was a freak of nature.

04:28.367 --> 04:29.867
And your point is?

04:29.933 --> 04:31.567
Do I need
to hit you again?

04:32.933 --> 04:35.267
Oh, look.
That's Olivia tompkins.

04:35.333 --> 04:38.400
She's one of our largest
financial contributors,

04:38.467 --> 04:39.967
but also our biggest gossip,

04:40.067 --> 04:41.733
so I have no doubt

04:41.800 --> 04:43.133
that our dance will be

04:43.200 --> 04:45.233
the topic of conversation
at the next women's auxiliary.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.067
We're really
just two preachers

04:58.100 --> 05:00.633
trying to pass
for normal people.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.467
Ooh. Yum.

05:05.533 --> 05:08.167
You know,
you've always been able

05:08.233 --> 05:12.067
to eat the entire kitchen
and not gain an ounce.

05:12.067 --> 05:13.267
I really resent that about you.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.100
What are you up to
tomorrow night?

05:21.167 --> 05:24.367
I don't know,
watching TV...

05:24.433 --> 05:25.900
Ordering a pizza.

05:25.967 --> 05:27.367
If I'm feeling
truly adventurous,

05:27.433 --> 05:29.067
one with
everything on it.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.633
How about a movie?

05:32.700 --> 05:33.800
Not if it involves

05:33.867 --> 05:35.067
watching a couple

05:35.067 --> 05:37.367
of testosterone-challenged
men blowing up things.

05:37.433 --> 05:38.733
Okay, and what do you suggest?

05:38.800 --> 05:39.833
Oh, no, wait.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.400
Let me guess.
A romantic comedy?

05:41.467 --> 05:42.733
Isn't there a movie

05:42.800 --> 05:44.233
like "pride and prejudice"
meets "the matrix"?

05:46.067 --> 05:47.100
No.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.067
Okay, fine,
but only if you're paying.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.267
Deal.

06:00.633 --> 06:03.967
"You're so lovely.
You should be married by now."

06:04.067 --> 06:07.500
You feel like
a desperate, old spinster.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.133
Do you know that
the parishioners at my church

06:09.200 --> 06:10.833
are no longer
betting on my love life,

06:10.900 --> 06:12.833
but are actually
praying for it?

06:12.900 --> 06:14.267
Well, I wouldn't be concerned

06:14.333 --> 06:16.667
until they start organizing
24-hour prayer vigils.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.133
My other best friend
since divinity school,

06:20.200 --> 06:22.400
the reverend laronda Mason.

06:22.467 --> 06:24.133
I haven't told Ronnie

06:24.200 --> 06:27.200
about my decision to leave
the ministry yet either.

06:27.267 --> 06:28.967
I don't want to see the look
of disappointment on her face.

06:30.533 --> 06:32.133
Do you mind
if we have the check?

06:32.200 --> 06:33.400
Thank you.

06:33.467 --> 06:34.900
So when is pastor black

06:34.967 --> 06:36.333
going to be back in command
of the pulpit?

06:36.400 --> 06:38.067
Next week, I'll be back
to being an associate,

06:38.100 --> 06:39.533
which is pretty much

06:39.600 --> 06:41.467
like being tantalus
from Greek mythology.

06:41.533 --> 06:42.933
Who was tantalus?

06:43.067 --> 06:45.167
He's the guy
who hungers in the underworld

06:45.233 --> 06:47.400
with food
forever beyond his reach.

06:47.467 --> 06:50.267
That sounds
like me next week

06:50.333 --> 06:52.067
after I start
my new fitness program.

06:52.133 --> 06:53.867
But in the meantime,
this apple pie looks--

06:53.933 --> 06:55.100
oh, yes. Please do.

06:55.167 --> 06:56.500
Amazing.

06:56.567 --> 06:58.167
You know, you make
being a minister

06:58.233 --> 06:59.600
look like a cakewalk.

06:59.667 --> 07:02.100
You got your congregation
to build a 1,500-seat sanctuary

07:02.167 --> 07:04.300
and partner with
a sister church in Africa.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.867
It's amazing.

07:06.933 --> 07:09.100
Yes, I'm a preacher's kid,

07:09.167 --> 07:10.500
but it's still feels like

07:10.567 --> 07:12.267
I'm hauling myself
up mount Everest

07:12.333 --> 07:14.133
with my legs tied every day.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.067
The last time
I trusted a church,

07:16.133 --> 07:18.300
I got fired and humiliated.

07:18.367 --> 07:20.400
Maybe I'm not suited for this.

07:20.467 --> 07:23.200
You can't play it safe
with the ministry, case.

07:23.267 --> 07:24.933
If you have security,

07:25.067 --> 07:26.467
then you're not
doing your job.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.900
And I know you're looking
for guarantees in this,

07:28.967 --> 07:30.867
but there aren't any.

07:30.933 --> 07:32.133
How can anyone live

07:32.200 --> 07:34.167
without at least
a few guarantees of some kind?

07:34.233 --> 07:36.200
It's called "faith."

07:36.267 --> 07:37.500
Thank you.

07:37.567 --> 07:39.233
Which just reaffirms

07:39.300 --> 07:41.067
my decision
to leave the ministry

07:41.100 --> 07:43.067
and to go to law school.

07:43.133 --> 07:46.333
I've been accepted at Braxton
for the fall semester.

07:57.433 --> 07:58.300
Good morning.

07:58.367 --> 07:59.267
Good morning.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.367
Do you have any idea

08:00.433 --> 08:02.067
what this emergency
meeting is about?

08:02.067 --> 08:03.300
I have no idea.

08:03.367 --> 08:05.400
So, you and reverend swenson?

08:05.467 --> 08:07.067
I saw you dancing
last night.

08:07.133 --> 08:08.500
Are you an item?

08:08.567 --> 08:11.067
No. David and I
are just friends.

08:11.100 --> 08:12.933
That's what celebrities
say in the tabloids,

08:13.067 --> 08:14.267
then they turn around,

08:14.333 --> 08:15.133
and, nine months later,
they have a love child.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.233
I can assure you

08:16.300 --> 08:17.500
that reverend swenson and I

08:17.567 --> 08:19.867
are in no immediate danger
of that happening.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.500
Well...

08:21.567 --> 08:23.200
He is a very handsome
young man.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.567
Good morning.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.067
Am I late?

08:29.100 --> 08:30.867
We just started.
Have a seat.

08:39.067 --> 08:41.267
Okay...

08:41.332 --> 08:43.633
Pastor black has just announced
his retirement.

08:43.700 --> 08:45.367
He did?

08:45.433 --> 08:47.067
Effective immediately.

08:48.300 --> 08:49.600
Miss hart,

08:49.667 --> 08:50.967
congratulations.

08:52.267 --> 08:55.567
You have been appointed
interim senior minister.

08:55.633 --> 08:57.567
Of course, you'll
have to keep

08:57.633 --> 08:59.533
your other Christian
education programs

08:59.600 --> 09:01.400
still running,

09:01.467 --> 09:03.233
but we have faith
in you, Casey.

09:03.300 --> 09:04.333
We know you can do it.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.733
Oh, ed.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.300
-That is really flattering--
-yeah, I know.

09:08.367 --> 09:10.067
I mean, most churches

09:10.067 --> 09:12.200
wouldn't trust a woman
with this kind of thing,

09:12.267 --> 09:13.333
but we're progressive

09:13.400 --> 09:14.633
here at
the church of the Shepherd.

09:14.700 --> 09:15.900
As treasurer,

09:15.967 --> 09:19.367
I feel it is a mistake
to ask associate pastor hart

09:19.433 --> 09:21.300
to take on the position

09:21.367 --> 09:23.067
of senior pastor.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.467
Oh, you do?

09:24.533 --> 09:26.433
And why do you think
it's a mistake, Mrs. Tompkins?

09:26.500 --> 09:28.333
Now, now, dear,

09:28.400 --> 09:30.333
I'm just-- I'm just looking out
for your best interests.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.233
You're far too young

09:33.300 --> 09:34.500
and inexperienced...

09:34.567 --> 09:36.067
We don't have
the reserves

09:36.100 --> 09:37.500
for three ministers.

09:37.567 --> 09:39.500
That's why Casey here

09:39.567 --> 09:41.467
is the perfect solution.

09:41.533 --> 09:43.633
It would take
about a year, is that right,

09:43.700 --> 09:45.967
to find a new pastor?

09:46.067 --> 09:48.267
Maybe 18 months?

09:48.333 --> 09:50.133
Well, that's really
up to us, Casey.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.067
We just need you to hold
the fort to the end of the year.

09:53.567 --> 09:56.267
We don't need
a real senior minister

09:56.333 --> 09:58.333
for this interim.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.067
And I'm sure
you can fill both chairs

10:01.133 --> 10:02.667
until we find one.

10:02.733 --> 10:03.700
I don't think that--

10:03.767 --> 10:04.567
[ahem]

10:04.633 --> 10:06.100
I'm sure

10:06.167 --> 10:09.167
Casey would be delighted
to do as we ask.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.000
She knows we can't get along
without her.

10:11.067 --> 10:13.867
Well, that's
settled, then.

10:16.833 --> 10:17.933
Casey, I'm going
to have to ask you

10:18.000 --> 10:19.200
to excuse yourself

10:19.267 --> 10:20.467
so we can start
talking about

10:20.533 --> 10:21.933
the search process.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.467
Oh.

10:23.533 --> 10:26.900
But thank you for coming.

10:26.967 --> 10:28.167
Okay.

10:28.233 --> 10:30.700
Right.

10:30.767 --> 10:35.600
Well, if there's anything
I can do

10:35.667 --> 10:37.100
to help with the search,

10:37.167 --> 10:38.567
you'll let me know.

10:40.767 --> 10:42.233
Oh, Casey,

10:42.300 --> 10:43.367
would you be a dear

10:43.433 --> 10:45.933
and brew us
a fresh pot of coffee?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.300
Oh, and some of
those little cookies

10:47.367 --> 10:48.900
left over from
the fellowship meeting.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.533
Decaf or regular?

10:55.567 --> 10:57.267
Hello, my name is Casey.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.300
I'll be your server today.

11:04.467 --> 11:06.367
[Casey]: I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.667
Are you sure the movie's
actually sold out

11:08.733 --> 11:09.867
or is this just a ploy

11:09.933 --> 11:12.100
so you can show off
your choir-boy past?

11:12.167 --> 11:13.233
Oh, come, on,
admit it,

11:13.300 --> 11:14.700
my vocal stylings
are way more entertaining

11:14.767 --> 11:15.700
than a couple
of muscle heads

11:15.767 --> 11:16.700
blowing each other up.

11:16.767 --> 11:17.600
We'll see about that.

Let's hear it for the ladies

11:37.067 --> 11:39.367
nd welcome our next performersa
to the stage.

11:39.433 --> 11:40.367
I told you
to get your own.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.533
Oh. Come on, share.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.433
No.

11:43.633 --> 11:45.667
Oh, that's us.

11:45.733 --> 11:47.067
You didn't.

11:47.067 --> 11:48.800
Of course, I did.
Come on.

11:48.867 --> 11:49.833
I can't
believe you.

11:49.900 --> 11:50.933
What song
do you choose?

11:51.067 --> 11:53.667
I requested
anything by bon jovi.

[Casey] Dear lord,

12:43.800 --> 12:45.533
how could I have known David
for eight years

12:45.600 --> 12:47.700
and not noticed how adorable
and hot he is?

12:49.667 --> 12:52.433
It's David.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.100
Maybe it is David.

12:54.167 --> 12:57.367
[Scatting]

13:10.200 --> 13:11.433
[David]: All right, case,
what's up?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.067
You've been acting strange
for a while.

13:13.133 --> 13:14.667
You still owe me
a movie.

13:14.733 --> 13:18.600
Done. I'm kind of
in a mood for ice cream.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.200
Oh, I can't,

13:20.267 --> 13:22.200
I'm preaching
tomorrow, remember?

13:22.267 --> 13:23.900
Okay, but next Saturday
after the movie,

13:23.967 --> 13:25.433
we're going to get
ice cream.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.067
Next Saturday's
Valentine's day.

13:30.067 --> 13:31.567
I'm busy.

13:31.633 --> 13:34.133
What, you got
a hot date?

13:34.200 --> 13:35.400
Yep.

13:35.467 --> 13:36.967
All right, Casey!
Way to go!

13:37.067 --> 13:38.367
So, who's the lucky guy?

13:38.433 --> 13:40.433
No one.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.167
Wow. It must be pretty serious
if you won't spill the details.

13:43.233 --> 13:45.800
I don't want to jinx it.

13:47.233 --> 13:49.067
Hey, case, it's not one of
your parishioners, right?

13:49.100 --> 13:49.967
No! I'm not
poaching sheep

13:50.067 --> 13:51.133
from my own flock.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.567
[Casey]:
I've broken a cardinal rule--

13:54.633 --> 13:58.133
he one about mixing friendshipt
with romantic feelings.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.300
I can never let him
know how I feel

14:01.367 --> 14:04.133
nd risk losing his friendship,a

14:04.200 --> 14:05.533
but, mostly,

14:05.600 --> 14:08.067
I'm afraid of what I felt
in there tonight.

14:08.067 --> 14:09.600
[Casey]: Slow down.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.500
I can't breathe.

14:11.567 --> 14:13.567
I've been
waiting on this

14:13.633 --> 14:15.333
since the first week
of div. School.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.667
I know, Ronnie,
but it's David!

14:18.733 --> 14:22.267
You mean smart, tall,
funny, kind David?

14:22.333 --> 14:25.067
The kind of man that
we'd give our eyeteeth for?

14:25.100 --> 14:26.333
I mean, look,

14:26.400 --> 14:27.667
if that zing of attraction
you felt for him was real,

14:27.733 --> 14:28.700
then you need to tell him.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.600
I will. I will!

14:30.667 --> 14:32.067
After I go out
on this date

14:32.100 --> 14:33.467
on Saturday night.

14:33.533 --> 14:35.133
Okay, let me
get this straight.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.167
You're turning
down a date

14:36.233 --> 14:38.167
with a man
you're attracted to

14:38.233 --> 14:40.200
to go out on a date with
a man who doesn't exist?

14:40.267 --> 14:42.233
Yes! Exactly.

14:42.300 --> 14:44.267
Except for David didn't
ask me on a date.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.500
He took me for granted,

14:45.567 --> 14:47.167
assuming that
I wouldn't be busy

14:47.233 --> 14:48.600
on Valentine's day.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.500
Girl, that's your fault.

14:50.567 --> 14:51.667
Not only did you

14:51.733 --> 14:53.300
give him the license
to take you for granted,

14:53.367 --> 14:56.067
you printed it, signed it
and laminated it.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.133
Yeah. You're right.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.800
But I can't let him
know that I lied.

14:59.867 --> 15:01.700
I can't seem
that pathetic.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.267
Will you help me?

15:03.333 --> 15:05.433
I have to find a date
for Saturday night.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.767
What am I going to do?

15:06.833 --> 15:09.067
What about James?

15:09.133 --> 15:10.100
No.

15:10.167 --> 15:11.767
Okay, do you want me
to ask my cousin

15:11.833 --> 15:13.367
to take you out
for Valentine's day?

15:13.433 --> 15:14.400
Yes.

15:14.467 --> 15:15.633
I know you don't have
nothing for him,

15:15.700 --> 15:18.133
and if it ain't true love,
it ain't worth it.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.667
Ronnie, please.
I have to save face.

15:20.733 --> 15:22.733
Your face needs to find
someone else to save it

15:22.800 --> 15:24.100
besides my cousin.

15:24.167 --> 15:25.267
[Casey]: You know what,

15:25.333 --> 15:28.567
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have asked that.

15:28.633 --> 15:30.067
I'll have to find someone else.

15:30.133 --> 15:34.467
Maybe some of the baristas
will know someone I could date.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.433
Fine. I'll ask my cousin.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.767
He just broke up
with his girlfriend

15:37.833 --> 15:39.400
and I know
he has nothing to do.

15:39.467 --> 15:41.433
Plus, he owes me.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.200
Oh, Ronnie! Thank you!
You're the best.

15:44.267 --> 15:45.300
Yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

Check you out.

16:08.900 --> 16:11.767
Uh, what are you
doing here, David?

16:11.833 --> 16:13.533
Oh, my Internet's down.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.267
Oh, so make yourself at home.

Oh, right,

16:18.933 --> 16:21.333
you've got
that big date tonight.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.267

16:22.333 --> 16:23.800
It's Valentine's day.

Yeah, and he's gonna be here
any minute.

16:26.733 --> 16:27.900
So are you running behind?

16:27.967 --> 16:29.867
What are you saying,
I don't look ready?

16:29.933 --> 16:31.600
So you're not ready?

16:31.667 --> 16:32.867
I don't know.
You look fine to me.

16:32.933 --> 16:34.700
Do I look fine,
or do I look not ready?

16:34.767 --> 16:35.733
Which one is it?

16:35.800 --> 16:38.100
Uh, you look...

16:39.867 --> 16:43.467
To be perfectly honest,
kind of weird.

16:43.533 --> 16:44.667
I look weird?

16:44.733 --> 16:47.367
Yeah. You're all...

16:47.433 --> 16:49.167
Sexy and stuff.

16:49.233 --> 16:50.700
Oh.

16:50.767 --> 16:51.667
Would it amaze you, David,

16:51.733 --> 16:52.800
to discover that some men

16:52.867 --> 16:55.900
actually find me
all "sexy and stuff"?

16:55.967 --> 16:57.333
Don't answer that.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.467
It will be easier.

17:07.800 --> 17:08.733
Hi.

Oh, wow. You look gorgeous.

pretty handsome yourself.

that we've got

on Wednesday.

It's great. You'll love it.

to lock up when you leave.

-We will.

18:09.633 --> 18:10.833
Oh, thanks, Angelique.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.600
The dang fool thing
is leaking something fierce.

18:17.067 --> 18:19.533
My first serious crisis
as senior interim minister.

18:21.533 --> 18:23.667
Why don't you
patch it up, jed?

18:23.733 --> 18:26.300
Well, there's
nothin' left to patch.

18:26.367 --> 18:27.567
Oh.

18:27.633 --> 18:28.733
And a new one's
gonna run in the thousands.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.667
Oh.

18:31.967 --> 18:33.567
I guess I'll...

18:33.633 --> 18:35.300
Well, I'll call Gus and get
the property division on it.

18:37.600 --> 18:38.467
If you think that's best.

18:40.633 --> 18:41.833
On second thought,

18:41.900 --> 18:43.500
why don't I go
take a look at it for myself,

18:43.567 --> 18:44.600
just to make sure

18:44.667 --> 18:46.233
you didn't sabotage it
just to test me.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.333
Oh. Okay.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.600
The leak originated
above the ceiling.

You can go see
for yourself.

19:16.833 --> 19:19.867
I'll take your word for it.

19:19.933 --> 19:22.333
No, no, no, no.

I don't want you
to doubt me.

Ah...

19:53.433 --> 19:55.833
Yep.

19:55.900 --> 19:57.633
Oh, yeah.
I see what you're saying, jed.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.400
I'm coming down.

20:13.433 --> 20:17.633
I gotta say,
it's hopeless.

20:17.700 --> 20:20.367
Oh, it's not
hopeless, reverend.

20:20.433 --> 20:22.900
It's just in need of some
male know-how, that's all.

There you are.

about this Sunday's service.

to both of you.

focus more on your job

Oh, Casey,

20:59.367 --> 21:00.667
I'll sign you up.

21:01.833 --> 21:02.733
Excuse me.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.300
Um...

21:12.400 --> 21:15.833
[Church bell tolling]

21:15.900 --> 21:18.533
Hear these words
from the gospel of Mark.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.533
In today's passage,
there were many lost things.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.433
Sheep. Coins.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.300
You know, when I was a child
and I would lose something,

21:27.367 --> 21:29.267
my mother would often tell me

21:29.333 --> 21:32.300
it would be in the last place
that I looked.

21:33.367 --> 21:35.533
God never gives up finding us,

21:35.600 --> 21:38.600
no matter
how far we've wandered off,

21:38.667 --> 21:43.867
no matter what cracks
we've fallen into.

21:43.933 --> 21:45.833
He never gives up.

21:45.900 --> 21:48.433
But are we willing to be found?

21:48.500 --> 21:52.900
Because when we truly surrender
to the care of our Shepherd,

21:52.967 --> 21:56.367
we are relinquishing our lives
to a higher authority.

21:56.433 --> 21:59.433
Thanks be to god.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.533
Amen.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.433
[Congregation]: Amen.

22:08.567 --> 22:12.333
[***]

22:17.300 --> 22:18.467
My goals for today--

22:18.533 --> 22:20.467
one, convince David
it's a good idea

22:20.533 --> 22:22.633
I took the interim
senior minister job.

22:22.700 --> 22:25.067
Two, convince myself
it's a good idea

22:25.133 --> 22:28.300
that I took the interim
senior minister job.

22:28.367 --> 22:29.767
Three, don't let on to David

22:29.833 --> 22:32.333
that I have the urge
to nibble on his neck.

22:32.400 --> 22:35.767
Four, don't actually
nibble on his neck.

22:38.667 --> 22:39.700
Hey, case.

22:39.767 --> 22:40.533
Go get your shoes.
Come on.

22:40.600 --> 22:41.433
Okay.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.467
So how was
your date?

22:45.533 --> 22:46.767
Okay.

22:50.467 --> 22:51.300
Okay...

22:54.133 --> 22:55.300
You need
to get out of your head

22:55.367 --> 22:58.267
and just let your natural rhythm
take over.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.400
Let me guide you.

22:59.467 --> 23:02.100
So we're going to take
three steps...

23:02.167 --> 23:04.433
And then release. Okay?

23:04.500 --> 23:05.633
Here we go.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.467
One, two, three...

23:12.367 --> 23:14.933
It's an improvement, I guess.

23:16.067 --> 23:17.300
So, how's church?

23:17.367 --> 23:19.167
It's okay, I guess.

23:19.233 --> 23:20.500
I feel like I missed
a few classes

23:20.567 --> 23:21.933
at divinity school,

23:22.067 --> 23:22.833
like plumbing 101,

23:22.900 --> 23:26.200
introduction to culinary school,

23:26.267 --> 23:28.267
house cleaning.

23:28.333 --> 23:29.500
And here I thought
all I needed

23:29.567 --> 23:30.333
was a simple understanding
of the Bible

23:30.400 --> 23:32.600
and systematic theology.

23:32.667 --> 23:34.200
You deserve your shot
at a healthy pastorate.

23:34.267 --> 23:35.633
You know this isn't it.

23:35.700 --> 23:37.133
I just--

23:37.200 --> 23:39.133
I just want to be top dog
for a little bit,

23:39.200 --> 23:41.067
like what you get to experience
every day.

23:43.433 --> 23:45.500
Look, if you're hellbent
on doing this,

23:45.567 --> 23:46.967
then there's a few
senior pastor secrets

23:47.067 --> 23:47.967
that I need to tell you about.

23:48.067 --> 23:50.400
What? There are secrets?

23:50.467 --> 23:51.700
You never told me
there were secrets!

23:51.767 --> 23:53.600
You didn't need them before.

23:53.667 --> 23:56.067
You were never a senior pastor
at a significant congregation.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.133
As opposed to
an insignificant congregation?

23:58.200 --> 23:59.500
I see.

23:59.567 --> 24:01.200
I can't believe you never
told me there were secrets.

24:04.300 --> 24:07.200
This information is on
a need-to-know basis only.

24:07.267 --> 24:08.300
Okay.

24:08.367 --> 24:10.167
Secret number one--

24:10.233 --> 24:11.300
at least once
during every sermon,

24:11.367 --> 24:12.267
you want to lift
the Bible up in the air

24:12.333 --> 24:13.333
and you want to wave it around.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.567
I thought you were serious.

24:15.633 --> 24:17.167
I am serious.

24:17.233 --> 24:19.067
Okay, well,
I just don't know

24:19.067 --> 24:20.767
how that's going
to help.

24:20.833 --> 24:22.333
Congregations want someone

24:22.400 --> 24:23.500
that's going to be able
to preach the material.

24:28.133 --> 24:31.467
Nice. Okay, secret number two--

24:31.533 --> 24:33.100
visit anyone
that goes in the hospital

24:33.167 --> 24:34.500
within 24 hours.

24:34.567 --> 24:35.500
Oh, wow.
Who wouldn't do that?

24:35.567 --> 24:36.900
You'd be surprised.

24:36.967 --> 24:38.333
I could tell you some
horror stories at St. Helga's

24:38.400 --> 24:39.300
that would curl your hair.

24:39.367 --> 24:40.533
Please don't.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.133
I'm already using
six different types of gels

24:42.200 --> 24:43.333
to keep it straight as it is.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.667
It does look
kind of straw-like,

24:44.733 --> 24:46.533
I'll give you that.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.067
All right,
what's secret number three?

24:48.133 --> 24:50.067
Never drive a better car
than your parishioners.

24:50.133 --> 24:51.367
Done!

24:51.433 --> 24:52.633
Got that one!

24:52.700 --> 24:53.700
How is any of this
going to help me

24:53.767 --> 24:56.633
become a better
senior minister?

24:57.667 --> 24:58.867
Hey, hey!

24:58.933 --> 25:00.967
Don't underestimate my advice.
It's golden.

25:03.233 --> 25:04.500
There is one more thing.

25:05.667 --> 25:07.433
Don't date a parishioner.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.267
That's, like, the second time
you've warned me off

25:09.333 --> 25:10.733
with something like that.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.433
And how is any of that
going to help me

25:12.500 --> 25:14.333
get Mrs. Tompkins off my back

25:14.400 --> 25:15.800
and convince the board

25:15.867 --> 25:18.400
that I can lead
the congregation?

25:18.467 --> 25:19.367
Wow!

25:19.433 --> 25:20.800
When you're the top dog,

25:20.867 --> 25:22.067
people are going to project
all sorts of stuff on you,

25:22.067 --> 25:23.400
but you need to know
that it's not about you.

25:23.467 --> 25:25.267
You can't take it personally.

25:26.500 --> 25:27.700
Okay, I'm pretty sure

25:27.767 --> 25:28.433
I could have figured
that one out on my own.

25:28.500 --> 25:29.400
Thank you.

25:29.467 --> 25:31.133
Case, you kind of have a habit

25:31.200 --> 25:32.533
of not really
figuring things out

25:32.600 --> 25:35.067
until a little bit
after the fact.

25:41.833 --> 25:44.733
[Church bell tolling]

25:44.800 --> 25:46.767
[Olivia]: I brought
a little treat for our meeting.

25:46.833 --> 25:49.700
[Man]: Oh, Olivia, thank you.
Your wonderful cookies.

25:49.767 --> 25:52.133
Mm! My favorite.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.233
Delicious as always, Olivia.

25:54.300 --> 25:55.433
We have to have
some coffee

25:55.500 --> 25:56.467
with the blondies.

25:56.533 --> 25:57.467
Oh, Casey,
perfect timing.

25:57.533 --> 25:59.333
Would you please
get the coffee?

26:05.733 --> 26:06.767
We have
a confirmed report

26:06.833 --> 26:08.300
from the money counters

26:08.367 --> 26:09.600
that the cash offerings

26:09.667 --> 26:11.700
are down significantly
in the last two weeks.

26:11.767 --> 26:13.267
Well, people
are clearly expressing

26:13.333 --> 26:15.933
their displeasure
with Casey in the pulpit.

26:16.067 --> 26:18.900
Well, the question
we have to consider is

26:18.967 --> 26:20.267
are we concerned about theft

26:20.333 --> 26:23.833
or whether it's
a regular fluctuation?

26:23.900 --> 26:25.233
Well, I can't imagine

26:25.300 --> 26:28.200
anyone would withhold
their offering because of Casey.

26:28.267 --> 26:29.467
[Casey]: Um, there have been

26:29.533 --> 26:31.100
a lot of people out of town

26:31.167 --> 26:32.533
and a little bit of restlessness

26:32.600 --> 26:35.333
because of reverend black's
departure.

26:37.700 --> 26:39.333
[Olivia]:
We have to do something now

26:39.400 --> 26:40.633
before Casey cripples
this church financially.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.700
I hate to disagree
with you, Olivia.

26:43.767 --> 26:45.433
I'm not prepared to

26:45.500 --> 26:46.833
jump to that
conclusion just yet.

26:46.900 --> 26:49.933
I think we have to adopt
a wait-and-see attitude.

26:50.067 --> 26:52.567
[Casey]: I'm willing to bet
that it's a timing thing.

26:52.633 --> 26:54.833
If we just give it some time.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.400
I agree.

26:56.467 --> 26:57.267
Shall we vote?

26:59.533 --> 27:00.500
Excellent.

27:00.567 --> 27:02.600
Carried.

27:02.667 --> 27:04.167
Casey?

27:07.733 --> 27:10.467
Just be careful, okay?

27:10.533 --> 27:11.900
Don't do any damage

27:11.967 --> 27:15.533
until we can get
a real minister in, okay?

27:15.600 --> 27:16.533
Okay.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.133
Okay, good.
Oh, coffee.

27:22.100 --> 27:25.133
Okay...
Let's get this meeting started.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.533
You've flourished
as a solo pastor

27:29.600 --> 27:31.300
while I've collapsed

27:31.367 --> 27:34.433
under the weight
of conflict and criticism.

27:34.500 --> 27:37.200
I can't handle
another conflict right now.

27:37.267 --> 27:38.467
And I can't believe

27:38.533 --> 27:40.667
you talked me into doing
your crazy workout program.

27:40.733 --> 27:42.233
That was nuts.

27:42.300 --> 27:43.867
It's good for you.

27:43.933 --> 27:45.067
Look, you're only afraid
of conflict

27:45.067 --> 27:46.433
because of your last church,

27:46.500 --> 27:47.500
and you shouldn't be.

27:47.567 --> 27:48.733
Well, yeah.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.267
That congregation
had it out for me.

27:50.333 --> 27:52.267
I mean, they not only hated me,
they seriously disliked me.

27:52.333 --> 27:54.600
There were scathing reviews,

27:54.667 --> 27:58.267
unsigned letters
and secret meetings.

27:58.333 --> 28:00.300
[Ronnie]: You're still
licking your wounds.

28:00.367 --> 28:03.600
Look, conflict isn't always bad.

28:03.667 --> 28:04.767
I mean,
sometimes, it's a good thing.

28:04.833 --> 28:07.367
Sometimes, it helps you grow.

28:07.433 --> 28:08.633
I don't want to grow!

28:08.700 --> 28:10.400
I just want to
get past this.

28:10.467 --> 28:13.367
Have you called David?

28:13.433 --> 28:14.900
And what would I say?

28:14.967 --> 28:16.067
"Hey, David,

28:16.100 --> 28:17.700
"I've recently developed
a crush on you.

28:17.767 --> 28:19.267
Do you want to have dinner?"

28:19.333 --> 28:20.767
Sounds good to me.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.400
I need divine intervention.

28:22.467 --> 28:23.467
What you need to do

28:23.533 --> 28:24.367
is to get
your Booty in gear

28:24.433 --> 28:26.067
and call him.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.700
You know?
Come on, do it now,

28:27.767 --> 28:28.567
while you've got him
all thrown off.

28:28.633 --> 28:29.467
Really?

28:29.533 --> 28:30.800
Yes!

28:30.867 --> 28:32.700
What are you
waiting for?

28:35.067 --> 28:36.700
-Okay.
-Just do it!

28:36.767 --> 28:37.433
Okay.

28:37.500 --> 28:38.533
Great.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.667
And call me right afterwards.
I need the juice.

28:41.733 --> 28:42.900
All right.

28:42.967 --> 28:44.467
You're going to be
sore tomorrow.

28:46.067 --> 28:47.867
Okay. All right.

28:49.133 --> 28:51.300
Grant me faith, o lord.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.400
[Telephone ringing]

28:58.100 --> 28:59.300
Hello?

28:59.367 --> 29:00.333
[Casey] Hi, David.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.600
Hey, hart. What's up?

29:01.667 --> 29:04.067
Nothing.

29:04.067 --> 29:06.333
Just recovering
from power yoga.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.733
What about you?

29:07.800 --> 29:11.433
I am refereeing the design
of the new worship center.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.300
Apparently,
sanctuaries are passe.

29:13.367 --> 29:14.600
Who knew?

29:14.667 --> 29:16.967
Oh. Well.

29:17.067 --> 29:19.100
Hey, listen,

29:19.167 --> 29:21.500
do you want to head over
to lake turnbell

29:21.567 --> 29:23.433
for a walk this evening?

29:23.500 --> 29:24.867
I figured
you'd be doing something

29:24.933 --> 29:25.800
with that guy
from the other night.

29:25.867 --> 29:27.500
You two looked pretty tight.

29:27.567 --> 29:28.867
Oh, we did?

29:28.933 --> 29:32.733
Yeah.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.833
I figured that you'd be busy
so I made other plans.

29:34.900 --> 29:38.833
Oh! Oh...

29:38.900 --> 29:41.167
Well, that's no biggie.

29:41.233 --> 29:45.067
Yeah, we could walk
lake turnbell another time.

29:45.133 --> 29:46.733
Yeah, okay.

29:46.800 --> 29:50.367
Well, look, case,
I should get going.

29:50.433 --> 29:52.367
I have to pick up my date
in about 20 minutes.

29:52.433 --> 29:54.833
Great. Okay.

29:54.900 --> 29:58.133
Have a good time,

29:58.200 --> 30:00.100
and hey, listen,
don't wear any band t-shirts.

30:00.167 --> 30:03.600
Wear, like, a normal shirt
with a collar.

30:03.667 --> 30:05.900
Well, I don't go anywhere
without a collar,

30:05.967 --> 30:08.533
one way or another.

30:08.600 --> 30:09.433
Bye.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.267
Well, that was an epic failure.

30:17.233 --> 30:19.067
Fear's been doing
a lot of talking lately.

30:19.133 --> 30:20.033
[Chuckles] Oh.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.367
[Casey] I always look forward

30:23.433 --> 30:26.333
to my weekly visits
with my dear friend, Sarah.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.833
She's a minister, too,

30:27.900 --> 30:30.633
and I can always count on her
for spiritual guidance.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.900
[***]

30:36.700 --> 30:38.700
Good morning, sunshine.

30:38.767 --> 30:41.167
It's good to see you
up and at 'em again.

30:41.233 --> 30:42.667
Who's winning?

30:42.733 --> 30:45.233
Oh! I'm sure you are.

30:45.300 --> 30:47.500
Hello, sir.
How's your arthritis?

30:47.567 --> 30:49.500
Much better, huh?

30:49.567 --> 30:51.367
Good to hear.

30:51.433 --> 30:54.733
Miss Violet. Hi!
How's your hip healing?

30:54.800 --> 30:57.533
Oh, I'm on the mend,
pastor hart.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.300
Oh, that's fantastic.

31:00.367 --> 31:02.967
All right,
I'll see you later.

31:04.133 --> 31:06.200
You taking care
of our handsome man?

31:06.267 --> 31:08.067
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah? Good.

31:15.567 --> 31:17.433
Sarah, it's me.

31:20.867 --> 31:24.433
Oh, my darling Casey,
what a treat.

31:26.600 --> 31:29.300
Hi, Sarah.

31:29.367 --> 31:32.267
What's troubling
you, my dear?

31:32.333 --> 31:34.133
Pull up a chair.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.200
Tell me
what's going on.

31:48.767 --> 31:50.567
I'm leaving the ministry.

31:51.900 --> 31:54.200
I'm going to
go to law school.

31:54.267 --> 31:55.400
My dad'll be happy.

31:55.467 --> 31:57.800
He won't have to
send me money anymore

31:57.867 --> 31:59.600
to help pay for my rent
every month,

31:59.667 --> 32:01.500
and I won't have

32:01.567 --> 32:02.700
those pesky parishioners

32:02.767 --> 32:04.800
making my life
a living nightmare.

32:04.867 --> 32:07.333
Has god called you there?

32:07.400 --> 32:09.267
Or are you

32:09.333 --> 32:10.367
like Jonah,

32:10.433 --> 32:11.700
running away

32:11.767 --> 32:15.567
because things aren't going
according to your plans?

32:15.633 --> 32:18.600
I don't know
what god wants anymore.

32:18.667 --> 32:21.900
I thought I heard
the big guy say "ministry,"

32:21.967 --> 32:24.800
but now I'm thinking
it might've been "misery."

32:26.900 --> 32:29.900
It doesn't matter anyways.
I'm not cut out for the church.

32:29.967 --> 32:32.400
The opposite of faith
isn't doubt,

32:32.467 --> 32:33.867
it's fear.

32:33.933 --> 32:36.867
That is fear talking.

32:36.933 --> 32:40.533
Fear's been doing
a lot of talking lately.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.500
[Chuckles] Oh.

32:43.567 --> 32:48.467
God works
in the divine's own sweet time.

32:48.533 --> 32:51.200
How long would you be willing

32:51.267 --> 32:55.733
to wait for god to lead you
to that right place?

32:55.800 --> 32:57.833
What's your limit?

32:57.900 --> 33:00.200
I think
I've reached my limit.

33:01.700 --> 33:04.767
I mean, it took Jacob 14 years
to find a wife,

33:04.833 --> 33:06.067
and the israelites,

33:06.067 --> 33:08.433
they roamed the wilderness
for 40 years.

33:08.500 --> 33:09.833
I mean,
doesn't god know that the world

33:09.900 --> 33:12.733
works at a much faster pace
these days?

33:12.800 --> 33:15.400
If you've come
for my blessing,

33:15.467 --> 33:17.567
I can't give you one.

33:17.633 --> 33:21.367
You made
a commitment to god.

33:21.433 --> 33:24.600
You're the only one
that can unmake that promise.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.367
Church has always
been my refuge, you know?

33:32.433 --> 33:35.500
I found...

33:35.567 --> 33:38.467
Affirmation and...

33:38.533 --> 33:41.733
Opportunity...

33:41.800 --> 33:44.300
And comfort.

33:44.367 --> 33:46.633
It always seemed
like the right thing.

33:46.700 --> 33:49.933
You know, I've always done what
I thought was the right thing,

33:50.067 --> 33:52.300
but look at where
it's gotten me.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.100
I thought you'd understand.

33:57.467 --> 34:00.933
I don't want...

34:01.067 --> 34:03.733
You don't want what?

34:06.500 --> 34:07.733
It's just hard,

34:07.800 --> 34:10.632
being so close to what you want

34:10.699 --> 34:13.632
and knowing
you'll never have it.

34:15.567 --> 34:17.833
Have faith in god.

34:17.900 --> 34:20.300
Trust yourself.

34:20.367 --> 34:22.266
And god.

34:23.867 --> 34:24.699
And drink some tea.

34:34.967 --> 34:37.867
[Announcement crackling
as phone beeps]

34:52.132 --> 34:53.533
[David]: He'll help you
through this tough time,

34:53.600 --> 34:55.300
and I thought you needed
someone in your parish

34:55.367 --> 34:56.667
on your side,

34:56.733 --> 34:58.633
and now you'll have a friend,
and you won't be lonely.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.067
Yeah, I mean,
how can I be lonely

35:00.133 --> 35:02.733
with little Simon Peter around
to keep me company?

35:04.667 --> 35:06.067
Hot date tonight?

35:06.133 --> 35:07.933
Not unless
you count Simon Peter.

35:08.067 --> 35:09.067
How about you?

35:09.100 --> 35:11.967
I am going to the movies,

35:12.067 --> 35:14.333
but absolutely
no ice cream afterward.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.567
That's your territory.

35:15.633 --> 35:16.667
I'll hold you to that.

35:16.733 --> 35:18.367
You'd better.

35:18.433 --> 35:19.533
Okay.

35:23.067 --> 35:24.933
I'm going to go
pay for this stuff.

35:25.067 --> 35:27.333
Okay. Thank you.

35:30.967 --> 35:32.867
[***]

35:41.067 --> 35:42.700
Hi, Angelique.

35:42.767 --> 35:44.967
Oh! Uh, ed called.

35:45.067 --> 35:46.767
He has some
suggestions for you.

35:46.833 --> 35:48.067
Okay.

35:48.133 --> 35:49.467
David called for you
from a pet store.

35:49.533 --> 35:50.767
Did that.

35:50.833 --> 35:52.967
Mrs. Tompkins wants you
to make a grocery run

35:53.067 --> 35:54.667
for salad dressings
before the next

35:54.733 --> 35:55.833
ladies'
auxiliary meeting.

35:55.900 --> 35:57.100
I didn't realize
I was her personal shopper

35:57.167 --> 35:59.633
as well as her minister. Next?

35:59.700 --> 36:01.067
He bought you a fish?

36:01.067 --> 36:03.567
Oh. Yeah.

36:03.633 --> 36:05.200
Isn't that, like,
the sweetest thing?

36:05.267 --> 36:06.700
That's a betta fish.

36:06.767 --> 36:08.133
So?

36:08.200 --> 36:09.533
You can't put a betta fish
in the tank with other fish

36:09.600 --> 36:11.433
because it'll attack
and kill them.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.833
He got me an aggressive,
antisocial fish?

36:13.900 --> 36:15.067
Oh, they bite, too.

36:16.800 --> 36:17.867
Yeah.

36:17.933 --> 36:19.900
Yeah.

36:22.767 --> 36:25.133
Right. Let's get started.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.700
First...

36:26.767 --> 36:30.433
Oh, the collection money
is still worrisomely low.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.500
I heard a rumor
that someone's

36:31.567 --> 36:33.700
been skimming cash
out of the plates.

36:35.733 --> 36:37.467
I feel secure, Olivia,

36:37.533 --> 36:40.233
that the cash box
in the sacristy is secure.

36:40.300 --> 36:42.533
We've been using that system
for years,

36:42.600 --> 36:44.067
and we've never had any problem.

36:44.100 --> 36:45.233
Only the church
treasurer

36:45.300 --> 36:47.500
and the moneycounters
have a key, so...

36:47.567 --> 36:48.867
That's you
and them, Olivia.

36:48.933 --> 36:50.700
Well, then there's only
one other explanation.

36:50.767 --> 36:52.467
The offering is down

36:52.533 --> 36:55.933
because people don't want
a woman in the pulpit.

36:56.067 --> 36:59.267
You should resign now
before you destroy this church.

36:59.333 --> 37:02.067
[Ed]:
Is it too much for you, Casey?

37:02.133 --> 37:03.933
We were...

37:04.067 --> 37:04.933
We were thinking
it might be.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.067
[***]

37:09.133 --> 37:11.067
If the offerings are down,

37:11.067 --> 37:14.900
I'm sure it has more to do with
the change in the giving cycle

37:14.967 --> 37:17.700
than with a revolt
from the parishioners.

37:17.767 --> 37:18.867
[Olivia]: We are
in difficult enough

37:18.933 --> 37:20.800
financial straits.

37:20.867 --> 37:22.467
We can't jeopardize
the financial health

37:22.533 --> 37:24.133
of the church.

37:29.533 --> 37:31.467
Ooh, how did it go?

37:31.533 --> 37:33.200
You don't
want to know.

37:33.267 --> 37:34.267
That good, huh?

37:34.333 --> 37:37.067
-Yeah.
-Okay.

37:37.133 --> 37:38.133
[Sighs wearily]

37:38.200 --> 37:39.967
[Telephone rings]

37:40.067 --> 37:41.067
Reverend hart.

37:41.133 --> 37:42.600
Hey, it's me.

37:42.667 --> 37:44.133
Why don't you come over for
dinner and I'll cook something?

37:44.200 --> 37:46.967
Um, yeah, you're fabulous,

37:47.067 --> 37:48.800
but your idea
of a homecooked meal

37:48.867 --> 37:50.667
is hamburger helper
and a can of green beans.

37:50.733 --> 37:51.700
Not gonna happen.

37:51.767 --> 37:53.300
Ow about I cook?H

37:53.367 --> 37:56.233
excellent. It's been a while
since I've had steak a la Casey.

37:56.300 --> 37:58.533
Pfft. Okay, mooch.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.200
See you at 7:00?

38:00.267 --> 38:01.700
I'll bring dessert.

38:01.767 --> 38:02.700
Bring chocolate?

38:02.767 --> 38:04.067
Yes, ma'am.

38:04.100 --> 38:08.733
And I've got
a surprise for you, too.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.700
Oh, no, no, no. I can't handle
another surprise this week.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.500
You'll like this one.
You'll see.

38:14.700 --> 38:16.600
Okay.

38:25.067 --> 38:27.567
I'm going to
do it tonight, Ronnie.

38:27.633 --> 38:29.067
David's coming over for dinner

38:29.100 --> 38:31.533
and I'm going to tell him
everything about how I feel.

38:31.600 --> 38:32.567
[Knocking]

38:32.633 --> 38:33.800
Oh, my gosh!
Okay, he's here.

38:33.867 --> 38:35.733
Alright, I'll call you later.

38:35.800 --> 38:37.633
Wish me luck.

38:42.667 --> 38:43.600
Hey, case.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.667
Surprise!

38:45.733 --> 38:47.433
"Surprise"?

38:47.500 --> 38:48.967
Yeah! Remember?

38:49.067 --> 38:51.433
I told you on the phone
that I had a surprise?

38:51.500 --> 38:53.300
Oh! Did you say that?

38:54.467 --> 38:55.867
I'm Casey.

38:55.933 --> 38:58.067
[Squeals]: Oh!
Casey! Omigod!

38:58.100 --> 39:00.800
It's so great
to finally meet you!

39:00.867 --> 39:03.367
David has told me
so much about you!

39:03.433 --> 39:05.067
Has he?
Oh, that's funny.

39:05.067 --> 39:07.600
Sometimes, he forgets to mention
the most important things.

39:07.667 --> 39:08.700
I know, right?

39:08.767 --> 39:10.967
Don't worry.
I'm gonna fix that.

39:11.067 --> 39:13.433
Casey, this is Cali.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.400
It's short
for "California."

39:15.467 --> 39:17.967
That's where I'm from.

39:18.067 --> 39:20.367
Clever.

39:20.433 --> 39:22.067
[Giggles]

39:22.100 --> 39:23.867
Do I smell
something burning?

39:23.933 --> 39:25.633
The steaks!

39:31.433 --> 39:32.900
Oh!

39:32.967 --> 39:35.067
Oh... wow.

39:35.067 --> 39:36.933
Can I give you
a hand with that?

39:37.067 --> 39:40.600
No. No, it's just
a minor meat emergency.

39:40.667 --> 39:41.867
Are you sure?

39:41.933 --> 39:44.567
-Because it--
-I've got it under control.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.367
Thank you.

39:46.433 --> 39:49.700
Just not sure
if there's enough to eat now.

39:49.767 --> 39:51.633
I'm a vegetarian.

39:51.700 --> 39:52.800
Oh.

39:52.867 --> 39:54.933
And I'm actually
on a new low-carb diet.

39:55.067 --> 39:57.733
Well, that
solves that.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.000
Do you have
a bathroom?

40:00.067 --> 40:02.000
In the hall.

40:02.067 --> 40:03.333
-Okay.
-Uh-huh.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.767
So I guess this
wasn't the best way

40:07.833 --> 40:08.867
to spring this on you?

40:08.933 --> 40:10.500
[Laughs]

40:10.567 --> 40:12.733
I just,
when you said "surprise,"

40:12.800 --> 40:14.667
I thought something more like

40:14.733 --> 40:17.100
a new subscription
to a preacher's magazine.

40:17.167 --> 40:18.667
I blew it, didn't I?

40:18.733 --> 40:20.400
No.

40:20.467 --> 40:22.333
I'm just afraid
there's not enough food.

40:23.567 --> 40:24.967
I know that she's young,

40:25.033 --> 40:26.200
but she's really nice

40:26.267 --> 40:27.167
and I know
that you're going to like her.

40:27.233 --> 40:29.000
[Cali]: There's--
there's no soap.

40:29.067 --> 40:30.367
[Weary sigh]

40:31.667 --> 40:32.900
[Calls out]: Above the sink!

40:32.967 --> 40:35.400
I feel like her babysitter.

40:37.433 --> 40:38.900
Come on, case.

40:38.967 --> 40:40.933
Are we really gonna begrudge
each other a little happiness?

40:42.967 --> 40:44.800
[***]

40:46.033 --> 40:48.000
This is so great, case!

40:48.067 --> 40:50.700
I can just tell
we're going to be "bff"s!

40:50.767 --> 40:53.000
"Bffs"?

40:53.067 --> 40:55.733
"Best friends forever."

40:55.800 --> 40:58.667
I forgot the dessert.

41:03.167 --> 41:05.600
[***]

41:09.833 --> 41:11.767
Some surprise that was!

41:11.833 --> 41:13.067
Well, what
did you expect?

41:13.100 --> 41:14.567
If he doesn't know
you're interested in him,

41:14.633 --> 41:16.333
then he has every right
to look around.

41:16.400 --> 41:17.567
I tried to tell him.

41:17.633 --> 41:18.867
Trying and doing are
two different things.

41:18.933 --> 41:20.100
Good intention
will get you

41:20.167 --> 41:22.567
a dateless Saturday,
and not much more.

Well, it's too late now.
He's seeing someone.

41:24.600 --> 41:25.733
Do you want
David or not?

41:25.800 --> 41:28.600
That's unethical.
I'm not a man-thief.

ever been stolen

to keep trying!

41:33.467 --> 41:35.100
Yeah. What about
the other girl?

41:35.167 --> 41:37.067
Well, if he likes her,

41:37.100 --> 41:38.067
then no matter
what you say,

41:38.133 --> 41:39.633
he'll stay with her.

41:39.700 --> 41:41.667

are we gonna go?

41:41.733 --> 41:43.367
Not much more.

get your invitation

41:48.067 --> 41:49.633
for the fundraiser thing?

41:49.700 --> 41:52.067
Yeah. I mailed
in the check

41:52.100 --> 41:53.900
and threw out
the invite.

41:53.967 --> 41:54.933

41:55.067 --> 41:56.333
Yeah.

in that trash and get it

'cause you're taking
him with you.

Nothing like a little
black-tie do

a little romance.

Oh--

42:06.233 --> 42:08.267

all about what's-her-name.

Really? See?

42:12.167 --> 42:13.967
This is why it's so great
you're in my life.

42:14.067 --> 42:16.067
You really
simplify everything.

42:16.067 --> 42:17.533
Well, it is simple.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.533
You just like
to complicate things.

What's the matter, honey?

42:34.667 --> 42:38.633
The cash offerings
are at the lowest yet.

42:38.700 --> 42:41.167
Maybe people are voting
with their money.

42:41.233 --> 42:44.100
Maybe Olivia tompkins
was right,

42:44.167 --> 42:46.733
that people are so outraged
by my presence in the pulpit,

42:46.800 --> 42:49.200
that they're willing
to destroy their church.

42:49.267 --> 42:50.567
Maybe.

42:52.967 --> 42:55.900
Or maybe somebody's
stealing the offering.

a motion-detector camera.

43:32.100 --> 43:33.867
Sure.

43:33.933 --> 43:37.233
This here
is a game camera.

43:37.300 --> 43:39.500
A motion sensor
triggers the camera to record

43:39.567 --> 43:40.700
when activated.

43:40.767 --> 43:42.233
Hunters use them to track deer.

What are you stalking?

43:43.800 --> 43:45.133
A church

43:45.200 --> 43:46.867
It's a long story.

43:46.933 --> 43:48.167
This is exactly
what we need.

43:48.233 --> 43:49.100
We'll take it.

are you about dinner?

43:57.200 --> 43:59.133
No, I'm not.

43:59.200 --> 44:01.800
Just help me install the camera
and we'll call it even.

44:01.867 --> 44:04.300
I know you don't
approve of Cali.

44:04.367 --> 44:06.700
David, it's your life.

44:06.767 --> 44:08.800
I really shouldn't be
so judgmental.

44:08.867 --> 44:09.900
I'm glad to hear you say that.

44:09.967 --> 44:12.133
Actually, um,

44:12.200 --> 44:15.800
do you think Cali would let me
borrow you Saturday evening?

44:15.867 --> 44:17.933
I need an escort
for the fundraiser.

44:18.067 --> 44:19.200
Absolutely.

44:19.267 --> 44:21.867
I'll even break out my old tux

Hang it from up high.

44:56.233 --> 44:58.667
That's probably good.

All right, so,
do we need a ladder?

all sunny and rosy right now

-Hey.
-Hey.

54:20.067 --> 54:22.167
You gave Sarah
a wonderful eulogy.

54:22.233 --> 54:23.500
Yeah, you really
did her justice.

54:23.567 --> 54:25.600
We could really tell
how much you loved her.

54:25.667 --> 54:28.533
That was...

54:28.600 --> 54:30.967
Very nice.

54:31.067 --> 54:32.067
Thank you.

54:37.633 --> 54:39.900
We could
go to the movies.

54:39.967 --> 54:43.367
Yeah, or you can
come home with me,

54:43.433 --> 54:44.867
and we could
deep-condition our hair,

54:44.933 --> 54:46.167
or do some
manis and pedis?

54:46.233 --> 54:48.167
You guys are so sweet,

54:48.233 --> 54:50.833

to be alone right now.

How are you?

I'm well, and you?

56:11.633 --> 56:13.800
Good, good.
I'm actually looking for case.

-Yeah.

57:16.667 --> 57:18.700
What are
you doing here?

57:18.767 --> 57:21.300
We're worried about you.

57:21.367 --> 57:24.433
You're not
answering your phone.

57:24.500 --> 57:25.667
You didn't tell me

57:25.733 --> 57:26.367
what time I'm supposed
to meet you tonight.

57:27.800 --> 57:30.067
You forgot?

57:33.133 --> 57:35.633
The fundraiser.

57:38.267 --> 57:39.567
I'm not going to go to that.

57:39.633 --> 57:42.067
I can't.

57:42.133 --> 57:44.800
I think you should.

57:44.867 --> 57:47.567
I think... I think
that you have to.

57:47.633 --> 57:49.533
Sarah would be the first one
to tell you--

57:49.600 --> 57:51.133
life goes on, Casey.

57:51.200 --> 57:54.267
Yeah.

57:54.333 --> 57:56.900
That's fine.
Life can go on.

57:56.967 --> 58:01.367
I just need it to go on
without me for a little while.

58:01.433 --> 58:02.633
Yeah, but it doesn't.

58:04.433 --> 58:05.833
I already called Ronnie
and she's gonna come over

58:05.900 --> 58:07.433
in a couple hours
to help you get ready.

58:11.767 --> 58:15.467
I guess you guys didn't really
leave me much choice.

stand me up, hart.

You don't look so bad yourself.

We should get you a drink.

Okay.

01:00:00.033 --> 01:00:02.700
Um, there's something I need
to talk to you about, David.

01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:03.867
Okay.

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:06.567
I didn't plan this.

01:00:06.633 --> 01:00:09.400
We've been friends
for a long time.

01:00:09.467 --> 01:00:11.433
Yes.

01:00:14.533 --> 01:00:16.333
Uh...

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.800
No.

01:00:17.867 --> 01:00:20.600
I won't take advantage
of your grieving.

01:00:20.667 --> 01:00:23.600
I know that you're hurting,
right now, case,

01:00:23.667 --> 01:00:25.567
but this isn't the answer.

01:00:25.633 --> 01:00:27.400
What if I want to?

01:00:27.467 --> 01:00:28.633
[Sighs]

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.600
I don't think you know
what you want right now.

01:00:30.667 --> 01:00:32.400
You think I don't know
what I want?

01:00:32.467 --> 01:00:33.800
When have you ever?

01:00:33.867 --> 01:00:35.600
You thought that a small church
would satisfy you,

01:00:35.667 --> 01:00:37.367
but the second
that things got tough,

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:39.200
you didn't even fight,
you ran away.

01:00:39.267 --> 01:00:40.700
And then you thought

01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:44.267
that being an associate was
your calling to the ministry,

01:00:44.333 --> 01:00:45.967
but it turns out that
that's not it,

01:00:46.033 --> 01:00:48.333
and now you agree
to this interim thing, and...

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.900
You've never shown feelings
for me before.

01:00:50.967 --> 01:00:51.900
You're flailing, case.

01:00:51.967 --> 01:00:54.433
I am not flailing.

01:00:55.633 --> 01:00:56.900
And I'll have you know,

01:00:56.967 --> 01:00:59.533
I'm done with my so-called
career in ministry.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.567
I'm quitting
at the end of summer.

01:01:01.633 --> 01:01:03.300
To do what?

01:01:03.367 --> 01:01:05.467
Go to law school.

01:01:05.533 --> 01:01:07.067

01:01:07.067 --> 01:01:08.733
Are you serious?

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.067
Yeah.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.367
And when were you going to
tell me about this?

01:01:11.433 --> 01:01:12.500
When the time was right.

01:01:12.567 --> 01:01:15.267
As in, right before
school started?

01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:16.600
I can't believe

01:01:16.667 --> 01:01:17.767
that you would keep
something like that from me.

01:01:17.833 --> 01:01:18.933
Yeah, well, I knew
you would judge me.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.500
No, you knew
that I would tell you the truth.

01:01:24.433 --> 01:01:26.433
You have no idea
what god wants for you.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.700
You're squandering your gift

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:29.733
and you are latching on
to whatever's handy,

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.967
hoping that it's gonna
make you happy.

01:01:31.067 --> 01:01:34.667
I'm not willing
to be a guy that is handy.

We've known each other
way too long for that.

You mean too much to me.

01:01:40.633 --> 01:01:42.067
So you don't want me.

01:01:42.067 --> 01:01:43.833
Not like this.

it was working for me.

there's someone else.

someone else.

someone else.

01:05:46.367 --> 01:05:47.700
Come in.

01:05:47.767 --> 01:05:49.100
[Casey] Here's what
they don't tell you

01:05:49.167 --> 01:05:50.467
in divinity school.

01:05:50.533 --> 01:05:53.167
You will fall in love
with your parishioners,

01:05:53.233 --> 01:05:55.533
ven the snarky, obnoxious ones.E

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.067
did you bring my pain pills
or not?

01:05:58.133 --> 01:05:59.367
Yeah. They're right here.

01:06:01.533 --> 01:06:02.567
[Grumbles]

01:06:02.633 --> 01:06:04.200
I can't take them
without water.

01:06:04.267 --> 01:06:06.233
You may as well
make yourself useful.

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.567
[Casey] They don't tell you

01:06:07.633 --> 01:06:09.967
those imperfect folks
sitting in the pew

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:12.200
will worm their way
into your heart.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.267
[Pills rattle]

01:06:18.367 --> 01:06:20.433
Thank you.

01:06:25.233 --> 01:06:26.900
Go downstairs
and tell Alice

01:06:26.967 --> 01:06:29.567
to bring up
my magazines.

01:06:29.633 --> 01:06:32.200
We need to talk.

01:06:32.267 --> 01:06:34.433
I'm hardly in any condition
for tete-a-tete.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.067
It's about
the missing offerings.

01:06:38.533 --> 01:06:40.367
This is the hardly the time.

01:06:41.867 --> 01:06:45.200
I think right now
is the perfect time.

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:46.867
I know you took the money.

01:06:48.933 --> 01:06:50.967
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:06:52.533 --> 01:06:55.067
Just wait until the personnel
committee meets again.

01:06:55.133 --> 01:06:56.600
You should've resigned long ago,

01:06:56.667 --> 01:06:59.067
and next time, I'm going
to make sure that you do.

01:06:59.067 --> 01:07:00.567
You took the money

01:07:00.633 --> 01:07:03.567
so it would look like people
were protesting against me.

01:07:03.633 --> 01:07:06.567
Why, Olivia?

01:07:06.633 --> 01:07:08.467
Do you really
hate me that much?

01:07:09.933 --> 01:07:11.867
It's not right.

01:07:11.933 --> 01:07:14.067
Ministers should be men.

01:07:14.133 --> 01:07:16.133
Especially senior pastors.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.167
I'm a temporary fix.

01:07:18.233 --> 01:07:20.233
You really couldn't handle
a woman minister

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:21.933
just for a few months?

01:07:22.067 --> 01:07:24.467
If it's wrong,
it's wrong.

01:07:26.467 --> 01:07:27.867
Right.

01:07:29.333 --> 01:07:31.267
Some very faithful,
very Christian people

01:07:31.333 --> 01:07:33.267
don't think
it's wrong at all.

01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:35.067
If it was
wrong in my day,

01:07:35.067 --> 01:07:36.367
it's wrong now!

01:07:42.533 --> 01:07:44.400
Olivia...

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:50.200
Did you have a call
to be a minister?

01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:52.500
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.333
You did, didn't you?

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:00.500
What did they say?

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.500
[Sobs quietly]

01:08:05.567 --> 01:08:07.067
They said

01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:10.067
that Satan

01:08:10.067 --> 01:08:14.567
was tempting me away
from marriage and motherhood.

01:08:14.633 --> 01:08:16.332
Well, I've had
precious little of one

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:17.500
and none of the other.

01:08:17.567 --> 01:08:21.533
They said it was wrong,
that I was wrong.

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:26.067
And they were right.

01:08:27.267 --> 01:08:32.067
I was wrong to think
that I could ever be a minister.

01:08:35.466 --> 01:08:37.466
What if they were wrong?

01:08:43.433 --> 01:08:44.667
I'm tired.

01:08:44.733 --> 01:08:46.899
Go away now.

01:08:48.267 --> 01:08:50.433
[***]

01:09:17.233 --> 01:09:19.332
[***]

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:31.966
-Casey--
-hello.

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:33.367
We need to talk.

01:09:33.433 --> 01:09:35.367
Olivia called.
She told me everything.

01:09:35.433 --> 01:09:37.733
Oh.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.700
Oh, good. So you know
what's been happening

01:09:39.767 --> 01:09:41.600
to the cash offerings, then?

01:09:41.667 --> 01:09:43.100
Yeah.

01:09:43.167 --> 01:09:45.300
Well, I'm so glad I don't have
to keep it a secret anymore.

01:09:45.367 --> 01:09:46.500
I tell you what.

01:09:46.567 --> 01:09:48.067
You know,
if you needed money,

01:09:48.133 --> 01:09:49.533
you should have come
to the committee.

01:09:51.466 --> 01:09:52.600
Excuse me?

01:09:52.667 --> 01:09:53.966
Well, I told you,

01:09:54.067 --> 01:09:55.300
Olivia said that you'd
confessed everything to her.

01:09:55.367 --> 01:09:57.567
Did she?

01:09:57.633 --> 01:10:01.333
Well, I really must have
overestimated the painkillers

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.267
and underestimated the woman.

01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:06.500
She also set a very good
example of Christian charity.

01:10:06.567 --> 01:10:08.467
She said that we shouldn't
call the police,

01:10:08.533 --> 01:10:10.533
as long as you agreed
to resign and go quietly.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.900
What?

01:10:13.467 --> 01:10:15.267
Look, I think you should
return the money.

01:10:15.333 --> 01:10:17.167
I didn't steal the money, ed!

01:10:17.233 --> 01:10:19.467
I never expected
this of you, Casey.

01:10:19.533 --> 01:10:20.800
Well, I'm glad

01:10:20.867 --> 01:10:22.500
that my alleged kleptomania
comes as a shock to you.

01:10:22.567 --> 01:10:23.667
Alleged?

01:10:23.733 --> 01:10:25.833
Look, it's too late for denial.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.800
I've already called
an emergency meeting

01:10:27.867 --> 01:10:30.400
of the personnel committee for
first thing tomorrow morning.

01:10:31.733 --> 01:10:34.100
[***]

01:10:48.533 --> 01:10:50.700
-[Knocks]
-Hello?

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.733
You have a visitor.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.133
Angelique,
I really can't--

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.167
oh.

01:10:56.233 --> 01:10:58.600
This is a surprise.

01:10:58.667 --> 01:11:00.700
Can I come in?

01:11:00.767 --> 01:11:03.400
Sure, yeah. Come in.

01:11:05.067 --> 01:11:07.300
How've you been?

01:11:07.367 --> 01:11:09.500
Is this a trick question?

01:11:09.567 --> 01:11:10.800
Look, about the other night--

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:12.233
the security camera worked.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.467
Except for now Olivia tompkins

01:11:14.533 --> 01:11:15.967
is blaming me
for taking the offerings.

01:11:16.067 --> 01:11:19.167
And Olivia's
the real culprit after all?

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:21.167
Very astute.

01:11:21.233 --> 01:11:22.900
We need to talk.

01:11:22.967 --> 01:11:24.567
Do we? Really?

01:11:24.633 --> 01:11:26.367
I mean,
I'd rather just

01:11:26.433 --> 01:11:28.333
pretend Saturday night
never happened.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.600
Well, if we don't
talk about it,

01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:30.800
how are we supposed
to move past it?

01:11:30.867 --> 01:11:32.567
You're not past it?

01:11:32.633 --> 01:11:34.367
[Sighs] I swear...

01:11:34.433 --> 01:11:36.900
You can run away
even when you're standing still.

01:11:36.967 --> 01:11:38.533
Why don't you give me a call

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.900
when you're ready to talk,
okay, case?

01:11:39.967 --> 01:11:42.100
[***]

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.300
Bye.

01:11:46.667 --> 01:11:49.167
[***]

01:11:55.667 --> 01:11:58.333
[Casey, quietly]:
Okay, Sarah.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:02.167
I could really
use some words right now.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.367
[Casey sighs]

01:12:15.433 --> 01:12:16.967
Matthew 5:11--

01:12:17.067 --> 01:12:19.067
"blessed are you
when people insult you,

01:12:19.067 --> 01:12:20.333
"persecute you,

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.267
"and falsely say all kinds
of evil against you,

01:12:22.333 --> 01:12:24.533
because of me."

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.167
No. That's not right.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.233
Let's see.

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:32.867
Whatcha got here?

01:12:32.933 --> 01:12:36.100
Proverbs 20:1--

01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:38.367
"wine is a mocker,
beer is a brawler.

01:12:38.433 --> 01:12:40.400
Whoever is led astray
by them..."

01:12:40.467 --> 01:12:42.500
Oh.

01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:44.433
Silly.

"Fight the good fight

"for the true faith.

01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:02.367
"Hold tightly

[***]

01:13:15.067 --> 01:13:16.900
Thank you, Sarah.

01:13:16.967 --> 01:13:18.667
That's the one.

01:13:18.733 --> 01:13:20.600
Thank you.

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:24.233
[Breathes deeply, exhales]

[Indistinct
background exchange]

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.367
Ta-dah.

[Committee chuckling]

01:13:35.667 --> 01:13:36.700
Welcome.

01:13:38.833 --> 01:13:41.233
Here. Sit.

01:13:42.633 --> 01:13:45.500
-Need a hand?
-No.

01:13:45.567 --> 01:13:46.933
Shall we begin?

01:13:47.067 --> 01:13:49.300
-[Olivia cries out in pain]
-Oh, oh.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.067
Shall we begin?

01:13:54.567 --> 01:13:56.633
Casey, would you care
to start us in a prayer?

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.367
Sure.

01:14:00.733 --> 01:14:03.067
Almighty father,
we thank you for your guidance.

01:14:03.133 --> 01:14:06.100
We ask you to be with us
in this meeting today. Amen.

01:14:06.167 --> 01:14:07.700
[Overlapping]: Amen.

01:14:07.767 --> 01:14:09.900
I know who took the offerings.

01:14:09.967 --> 01:14:10.967
[Olivia]:
We all know, Casey.

01:14:11.067 --> 01:14:13.867
Your confession
comes a little late.

01:14:13.933 --> 01:14:14.900
We want
your resignation.

01:14:14.967 --> 01:14:16.567
Obviously, it wasn't me.

01:14:16.633 --> 01:14:18.933
That's not
obvious to anyone.

01:14:19.067 --> 01:14:21.400
Well, I've been
monitoring the sacristy

01:14:21.467 --> 01:14:24.233
with this surveillance camera.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:25.933
It was
one of our church members.

01:14:26.067 --> 01:14:27.733
I'd rather not say who,

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:28.833
because I do believe

01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:30.500
that they will return
the money to me,

01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:31.733
and that it won't happen again.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.800
And you expect us

01:14:33.867 --> 01:14:36.433
to believe
this outrageous story?

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:40.467
Well, yes, because I have
video footage.

01:14:40.533 --> 01:14:43.067
I think we probably
need to see it.

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.100
[Casey]: I'm willing
to forgive the culprit

01:14:45.167 --> 01:14:46.767
and give them a new start,

01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:48.800
because I believe
that's what Jesus would do.

01:14:48.867 --> 01:14:50.533
I believe in forgiveness,

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.200
and I'd like to practice that.

01:14:53.267 --> 01:14:58.200
You all chose me
to fill pastor black's shoes,

01:14:58.267 --> 01:15:01.700
and I'd like you
to honor that choice,

01:15:01.767 --> 01:15:03.933
and I expect you
to trust me

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:05.467
as senior pastor.

01:15:06.667 --> 01:15:08.767
Um...

01:15:08.833 --> 01:15:10.600
Well, as I'm sure

01:15:10.667 --> 01:15:13.733
we would all like to
avoid any major scandal,

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:18.200
it appears an unknown person
stole the money

01:15:18.267 --> 01:15:20.267
and then they returned it.

01:15:20.333 --> 01:15:21.767
-They did.
-And they won't do it again.

01:15:21.833 --> 01:15:23.067
Right.

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.667
That is correct.

01:15:24.733 --> 01:15:26.500
Good.

01:15:26.567 --> 01:15:27.767
Uh, the property committee

01:15:27.833 --> 01:15:31.100
will look into improving
security, but, uh...

01:15:33.267 --> 01:15:34.733
As it stands,

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.100
this committee
has nothing to act on.

01:15:36.167 --> 01:15:37.733
Well, then,

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.867
I guess we should
just adjourn.

01:15:38.933 --> 01:15:40.133
Uh, actually--

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.167
there is one more thing
that we need to discuss.

01:15:42.233 --> 01:15:44.733
This incident
has brought to my attention

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.700
that we need
a more structured agreement

01:15:46.767 --> 01:15:49.233
on my new role
as senior minister here.

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:52.200
I am asking for confidence
in my ministry,

01:15:52.267 --> 01:15:54.633
a 25% pay raise,

01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:57.200
and a one-year contract.

01:15:57.267 --> 01:15:59.467
And I'd like you to give me
an answer today.

01:16:02.733 --> 01:16:04.800
There, that's done.

01:16:07.233 --> 01:16:10.167
[***]

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:12.733
I believe Casey's requests
are reasonable.

01:16:15.267 --> 01:16:18.800
And as the largest contributor
in this congregation,

01:16:18.867 --> 01:16:20.800
I suggest we do as she says.

01:16:22.067 --> 01:16:23.267
The largest contrib--?

01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:25.567
You're the largest?
I thought--?

01:16:25.633 --> 01:16:27.467
We thought it was...

01:16:29.967 --> 01:16:31.533
[***]

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.567
Congratulations, Casey.

01:16:33.633 --> 01:16:34.767
Thank you, Marjorie.

01:16:34.833 --> 01:16:35.900
Yes.

01:16:35.967 --> 01:16:39.200
Congratulations, Casey.

01:16:39.267 --> 01:16:41.433
[***]

01:16:49.733 --> 01:16:51.933
[***]

01:16:54.233 --> 01:16:56.433
Oh, hi, Casey.

01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:00.067
I can do this later.

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:04.867
[***]

01:17:42.267 --> 01:17:44.100
Hi, Sarah.

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:53.833
I have something for you.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.300
I feel silly talking
to an empty room, but...

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:07.067
It feels good
to say it out loud.

01:18:11.867 --> 01:18:15.100
A good lawyer...

01:18:15.167 --> 01:18:17.333
Would have prosecuted Olivia.

01:18:20.767 --> 01:18:22.933
And enjoyed doing it.

01:18:23.067 --> 01:18:25.067
But... [sniffs]

01:18:26.433 --> 01:18:28.900
That's not me.

01:18:31.233 --> 01:18:33.167
That's not my calling.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.800
I thought this was
my ticket to happiness.

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:44.233
I was wrong.

01:18:45.833 --> 01:18:47.567
[Sniffles]

01:18:49.067 --> 01:18:51.567
Grant me faith, o lord.

01:19:04.067 --> 01:19:05.900
[Takes a deep breath]

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.067
Good morning,
Olivia.

01:19:21.067 --> 01:19:22.867
-Is it?
-Mm-hmm.

01:19:22.933 --> 01:19:24.300
Then why are you here?

01:19:24.367 --> 01:19:26.367
You have what you want.

01:19:35.467 --> 01:19:36.833
Aren't you
going to open it?

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:37.867
Why?

01:19:37.933 --> 01:19:39.400
I know what's in it.

01:19:39.467 --> 01:19:42.700
A request for me to resign
my membership in the church

01:19:42.767 --> 01:19:45.833
and a possible admonition

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.633
to be grateful you're not
turning me into the police.

01:19:49.867 --> 01:19:52.367
Come on.
Open it up and see.

01:19:56.067 --> 01:19:58.633
[Grudging sigh] Ahem.

01:20:06.033 --> 01:20:08.267
This isn't funny, pastor.

01:20:10.933 --> 01:20:13.067
No, it's not.

01:20:13.133 --> 01:20:15.433
It's far too late.

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.233
It's never too late.

01:20:20.567 --> 01:20:23.267
You've chaired almost
every committee in the church,

01:20:23.333 --> 01:20:27.067
run the women's auxiliary
and were the treasurer.

01:20:27.133 --> 01:20:28.433
You can do this!

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:31.000
I'll look like a fool.

01:20:31.067 --> 01:20:34.433
We all look a fool
one time or another.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.367
You'd be in good company.

01:20:44.333 --> 01:20:47.100
[***]

01:20:49.433 --> 01:20:51.367
Thank you.

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.200
No.

01:20:57.267 --> 01:20:58.400
Thank you.

01:21:01.133 --> 01:21:04.567
Thank you for helping me
remember and appreciate my...

01:21:04.633 --> 01:21:07.433
Ou calling

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.900
to serve god
in the church ministry.

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:14.233
[***]

01:21:17.867 --> 01:21:19.733
[Quiet chuckle]

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.367
Ahem. Alright.

01:21:26.267 --> 01:21:28.267
[***]

01:21:31.267 --> 01:21:33.133
-Hey!
-[Knocks]

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.300
Hi! I got your message.

01:21:35.367 --> 01:21:37.100
I'm leaving next week.

01:21:37.167 --> 01:21:38.600
So you got
your assignment?

01:21:38.667 --> 01:21:41.067
Well, I actually, uh,
I'm going to South Africa.

01:21:41.133 --> 01:21:43.500
I'm teaching at a school
for a.I.D.S. Orphans.

01:21:43.567 --> 01:21:45.400
Ronnie, that's amazing!

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:46.867
I know!

01:21:46.933 --> 01:21:49.167
They are so lucky to have you.

01:21:49.233 --> 01:21:50.300
I'm going to really miss you.

01:21:51.633 --> 01:21:53.400
I'm going to miss you, too.

01:21:53.467 --> 01:21:55.167
Mm.

01:21:55.233 --> 01:21:57.533
Okay, so,
what were you drinking

01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:58.633
when you came up with this plan?

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.067
-Oh--
-bell tower?

01:22:00.133 --> 01:22:01.267
I know. I know, it's crazy,

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.967
but it's time,
I have to tell him.

01:22:04.067 --> 01:22:05.367
So, come on, will you help me?

01:22:05.433 --> 01:22:07.167
-Absolutely.
-Okay. Come on.

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.900
[Ronnie]: Girl, this is crazy!

01:22:10.967 --> 01:22:13.067
Why couldn't you just
do things the normal way?

01:22:13.067 --> 01:22:14.900
For a good reason--
so I don't run away.

01:22:14.967 --> 01:22:16.067
Also, when have
I ever done anything

01:22:16.133 --> 01:22:17.367
the normal way?

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:19.367
Does Angelique at least
know to send him?

01:22:19.433 --> 01:22:20.867
Mm-hmm.
Wish me luck.

01:22:20.933 --> 01:22:23.333
Okay. You're cute.
Be careful!

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.067
I'm gonna go make sure
David finds you.

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:26.200
-Alright.
-Alright? Good luck!

01:22:26.267 --> 01:22:27.300
Thanks!

01:22:27.367 --> 01:22:29.767
[***]

01:23:01.433 --> 01:23:02.267
Case?

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.133
[***]

01:23:10.633 --> 01:23:12.833
I'm up here!

01:23:22.067 --> 01:23:24.100
Casey, what is going on?

01:23:24.167 --> 01:23:27.300
I just didn't want
anyone to find us.

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:31.533
Who in heaven's name
is gonna find us up here?

01:23:33.067 --> 01:23:35.900
[***]

01:23:38.667 --> 01:23:40.500
If you're going
through some sort

01:23:40.567 --> 01:23:42.633
of midlife crisis,

01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.267
then just say so.

01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:45.533
Maybe you just needed

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:46.700
the nearest
available safe guy

01:23:46.767 --> 01:23:48.433
for whatever drama's
got you in its throes,

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:51.167
but you have to deal, case.

01:23:51.233 --> 01:23:52.233
You actually think

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:53.367
this is some sort of

01:23:53.433 --> 01:23:55.333
hormonally-charged
midlife crisis?

01:23:56.667 --> 01:23:58.600
You want to know
what this is about?

01:23:58.667 --> 01:24:01.133
Yes, I do.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.067
I love you.

01:24:04.567 --> 01:24:05.733
There. I said it.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.500
I love you,
I've loved you

01:24:07.567 --> 01:24:10.067
from the moment I tripped
over your ginormous feet

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.400
in divinity school orientation,

01:24:12.467 --> 01:24:16.067
and just I didn't know it
until that night at karaoke.

01:24:17.433 --> 01:24:19.333
Why didn't you tell me?

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.133
Because I was scared.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.200
Of me?

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:25.600
Of rejection.

01:24:27.267 --> 01:24:30.533
I guess it was
more about me than you.

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.133
I told you
how I feel about you, and...

01:24:37.367 --> 01:24:40.067
What do you feel about me?

01:24:42.433 --> 01:24:44.467
I adore you.

01:24:46.433 --> 01:24:49.833
I've adored you pretty much
from the moment that I met you.

01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:55.367
"Adore" like
"cute kitten" sort of adore,

01:24:55.433 --> 01:24:59.667
or like, "you're a goddess.
I adore you."?

01:24:59.733 --> 01:25:02.067
The second one.

01:25:03.533 --> 01:25:05.967
[***]

01:25:08.533 --> 01:25:10.533
[Shrieking]:
Hallelujah! Whoo!

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.233
[Both laughing]

01:25:16.233 --> 01:25:19.067
[***]

01:25:20.467 --> 01:25:22.733
[Organ rises]

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:25.100
["Bridal chorus" plays]

01:25:25.167 --> 01:25:27.133
[***]

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:34.233
[Casey] No.

01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:37.667
I'm not performing
my own wedding ceremony.

01:25:37.733 --> 01:25:40.900
Next to me,
avid stands tall and handsome.D

01:25:40.967 --> 01:25:42.733
he and I
are sharing the honors,

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.300
officiating the service

01:25:44.367 --> 01:25:46.333
for the couple
standing before us.

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.600
Who brings this woman
to be married to this man?

01:25:48.667 --> 01:25:50.700
Her mom and I do.

01:25:53.433 --> 01:25:55.300
Good luck.

01:26:02.467 --> 01:26:04.500
And now,
David and Casey

01:26:04.567 --> 01:26:06.600
can join hands--

01:26:06.667 --> 01:26:08.167
oh.

01:26:08.233 --> 01:26:09.467
Oops.

01:26:09.533 --> 01:26:10.767
[David chuckles]

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:12.300
[Casey] I am amazed
when I think back

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:13.333
over the past few weeks

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.833
how my life has changed.

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:16.400
I got the feeling
the folks at law school

01:26:16.467 --> 01:26:20.767
seem relieved by my decision
not to matriculate there.

01:26:20.833 --> 01:26:23.233
I've taken Olivia
to visit the divinity school

01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:25.233
and meet
a few of the professors.

01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:27.367
I drove Ronnie to the airport.

01:26:27.433 --> 01:26:29.467
And as for David...

01:26:29.533 --> 01:26:32.067
Let's just say
we're trying to figure out

01:26:32.067 --> 01:26:34.233
how you go
from being best friends

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:36.933
to boyfriend
and girlfriend.

01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:38.500
It's perhaps the first time

01:26:38.567 --> 01:26:39.733
these walls have witnessed

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.600
this kind of
ministerial misconduct.

01:26:42.667 --> 01:26:47.067
With any luck,
it won't be the last.

01:26:49.933 --> 01:26:55.500
