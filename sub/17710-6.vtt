00:33.000 --> 00:36.960
This is the newest habitat on Earth.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.960
It's here that animals have to
contend with the greatest change

00:44.960 --> 00:47.600
that is happening to the face
of our planet.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.320
In this decade,

00:55.320 --> 01:00.200
the urban environment is predicted
to grow by nearly 30%.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.600
It may appear hostile
to animal life...

01:08.000 --> 01:12.960
..but for the bold, this is a world
of surprising opportunity.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.600
Jodhpur, India.

01:33.520 --> 01:36.360
A gang of bachelor male langurs

01:36.360 --> 01:40.000
has come to challenge
the resident alpha male.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.200
LANGUR GROWLS

01:46.200 --> 01:50.360
This alpha rules over
a valuable urban territory.

01:54.720 --> 01:58.280
But maintaining dominance here
is a constant struggle.

02:04.680 --> 02:08.000
The bachelors have united
to try and overthrow him.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.320
If they win,
one of the challengers

02:18.320 --> 02:22.200
will take over
the alpha's troop of females...

02:22.200 --> 02:24.320
and may kill his infants.

02:28.080 --> 02:31.200
There are 15 males
in this bachelor group.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.880
The alpha must evict every single
one of them from his territory.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.560
He has chased
half the bachelors away...

02:56.000 --> 03:00.240
..but a splinter group has looped
back and is harassing his females.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.000
Once again, he has to battle.

03:42.920 --> 03:46.400
Finally, he manages
to expel them all.

03:52.240 --> 03:55.200
but with a serious wound
on his right leg.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.600
It's a hard life for him
in the city.

04:05.240 --> 04:08.680
Keeping the intruders away
is a daily challenge.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.560
But it's worth it.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.720
For these urban territories

04:17.720 --> 04:20.920
are probably the best
langur territories in the world.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.520
They're filled
with rich feeding grounds.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.760
Here in the temple gardens,
the langurs have, over centuries,

04:36.760 --> 04:39.440
developed a surprising relationship.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.080
One that guarantees them

04:46.080 --> 04:48.760
a constantly replenished
source of food.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.720
The people here associate langurs

05:07.720 --> 05:11.720
with the Hindu god Lord Hanuman
and revere them.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.920
They're given all the food
they can eat.

05:32.600 --> 05:37.480
And this high-energy diet
has led to a baby boom.

05:41.720 --> 05:46.440
Female langurs in this city
give birth to twice as many young

05:46.440 --> 05:48.240
as their forest counterparts.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.120
This mother is so well fed

05:52.120 --> 05:56.840
that her rich milk can support
something rarely seen in the wild -

05:56.840 --> 05:58.280
twins.

06:03.640 --> 06:06.280
And all these babies
can create troops

06:06.280 --> 06:09.800
that are far larger than those
found in the forest nearby.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.280
With less time spent
looking for food,

06:14.280 --> 06:16.280
there is more time for play.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.960
The rewards of living in a city
can be huge.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.640
The challenge is to find your niche.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.800
POLICE SIREN WAILS

06:43.640 --> 06:45.320
New York City.

06:49.640 --> 06:55.000
This densely built-up landscape is
as unnatural as anywhere on Earth.

07:00.280 --> 07:05.920
And yet this wild peregrine falcon
looks out onto an ideal habitat.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.800
Strange as it may seem,

07:17.800 --> 07:21.680
this vastly altered landscape
replicates the conditions

07:21.680 --> 07:23.800
in which peregrines evolved.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.200
The towering buildings
have a multitude of ledges

07:32.200 --> 07:34.480
on which falcons can nest...

07:36.280 --> 07:39.760
..and the high perches
that they need to catch the wind.

07:44.160 --> 07:48.320
New York City has the highest
density of nesting peregrines

07:48.320 --> 07:50.440
anywhere on the planet.

07:58.200 --> 08:02.600
Winds striking the sides of the
skyscrapers are deflected upwards

08:02.600 --> 08:04.880
and can help the birds gain height.

08:08.800 --> 08:13.960
And the great areas of concrete
roasting in the sun create thermals

08:13.960 --> 08:18.920
so that, with very little effort,
the birds can soar over the city.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.160
And so many peregrines can live here

08:30.160 --> 08:34.799
because, down at street level,
there is a lot of potential prey.

08:51.640 --> 08:56.640
Diving from height, the falcons
can reach speeds of over 200mph.

09:02.480 --> 09:06.040
But their prey stay down low
and close to the buildings.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.840
Too risky, the peregrine
pulls out of his stoop.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.160
But the effort is not wasted.

09:23.160 --> 09:27.120
The falcons need to flush their prey
into the open.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.440
And Manhattan is surrounded
by water.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.720
Out here, the odds change,

09:36.720 --> 09:38.800
and in the peregrines' favour.

10:30.440 --> 10:33.960
With abundant prey here
all year round,

10:33.960 --> 10:36.840
it has taken only 40 years

10:36.840 --> 10:39.640
for these falcons
to establish themselves here.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.560
And now, among skyscrapers,

10:47.560 --> 10:51.600
they are more successful than their
cousins living in the wilderness.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.240
Mumbai in India is home
to over 20 million people.

11:05.600 --> 11:09.080
And there are predators here
that, though rarely seen,

11:09.080 --> 11:10.800
are rightly feared.

11:16.440 --> 11:21.240
Carnivores, lured by the prospect
of plentiful unsuspecting prey,

11:21.240 --> 11:23.160
are on the prowl.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.400
A leopard.

11:35.400 --> 11:39.720
Every night, under the cover of
darkness, they come out to hunt.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.320
These are big animals

11:45.320 --> 11:49.160
and they're looking for large prey
to satisfy their hunger.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.960
TELEVISION PLAYS IN BACKGROUND

11:56.560 --> 12:00.760
To catch more than a glimpse of them
and reveal their hunting behaviour,

12:00.760 --> 12:03.080
you need night-vision cameras.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.800
Leopards have attacked
almost 200 people here

12:17.800 --> 12:19.720
in the last 25 years.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.400
But humans are not their usual prey.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.800
These leopards are on the hunt
for something else.

13:04.520 --> 13:05.960
Pigs.

13:09.760 --> 13:13.840
These leopards prefer
to hunt the domestic animals

13:13.840 --> 13:17.520
that people have brought to the city
in considerable numbers.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.600
PIG GRUNTS

13:36.520 --> 13:39.160
The pigs keep their family close.

14:10.840 --> 14:14.760
The ceaseless noise of the city
plays to their advantage.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.120
It conceals their approach.

14:19.560 --> 14:24.000
And the leopards are using this
cover to hunt all over the city.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.440
PIGS SQUEAL

14:43.960 --> 14:46.760
This is a thriving population.

14:46.760 --> 14:50.640
In fact, the highest concentration
of leopards in the world

14:50.640 --> 14:52.080
is right here.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.320
BELL TOLLS

15:00.320 --> 15:02.960
It's not only the abundance of food

15:02.960 --> 15:05.240
that attracts wild animals
to cities.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.640
They're usually
several degrees warmer

15:15.640 --> 15:18.040
than the surrounding countryside.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.840
And here in Rome in December,

15:20.840 --> 15:25.520
one animal is taking full advantage
of this extra heat.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.240
And it's leaving its mark.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.600
In a single winter's day,

15:32.600 --> 15:36.680
ten tonnes of its droppings
rain down on the city.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.800
Starlings.

15:47.840 --> 15:51.000
In the evening, they come back
to the warmth of the city

15:51.000 --> 15:53.960
after feeding
in the neighbouring countryside.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.160
They must return
to their roosting trees,

15:59.160 --> 16:03.080
but the first to do so
are at the highest risk

16:03.080 --> 16:05.240
of being caught
by birds of prey.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.440
There's safety in numbers.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.880
As daylight fades,

16:17.880 --> 16:24.640
the sky fills with
a staggering one million starlings.

16:24.640 --> 16:30.000
And then follows
one of nature's great spectaculars.

17:11.280 --> 17:16.319
How, or indeed why, they perform
these marvellous aerobatics,

17:16.319 --> 17:19.000
we still do not fully understand.

17:29.560 --> 17:33.560
Eventually, en masse,
they brave the descent

17:33.560 --> 17:36.800
and fill the branches
of their favourite trees.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.640
On these cold winter nights,

17:43.640 --> 17:46.480
the city's extra warmth
can mean the difference

17:46.480 --> 17:48.520
between life and death.

18:01.920 --> 18:06.240
A city, of course, can provide
not only shelter and abundant food,

18:06.240 --> 18:07.920
but glamour.

18:09.760 --> 18:14.440
These varied objects have been
carefully chosen by a bird

18:14.440 --> 18:16.800
for their brightness
and their colour.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.400
This great bowerbird
has spent over a decade

18:22.400 --> 18:25.680
building this collection
of mostly man-made objects.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.280
Out on a golf course
in Townsville, Australia,

18:33.280 --> 18:37.120
he's putting the final touches
to his enormous bower

18:37.120 --> 18:40.360
that he hopes will impress
a visiting female.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.680
He spends two hours each day
rearranging his prized objects.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.920
Perhaps that would look
a little better over there.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.160
But it seems
that something is missing.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.160
Instead of going into town
to collect new objects,

19:12.160 --> 19:15.240
he's decided to raid
his neighbour's bower.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.320
A clothes peg - excellent.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.240
And a shiny toy car.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.000
It's a risky game if you get caught.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.880
The owner is back.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.000
BIRDS SCREECH

19:47.160 --> 19:50.600
There is one bower
where the risk is worth it.

19:51.760 --> 19:55.040
A particular object
has caught his eye.

19:58.440 --> 20:01.120
You'll have to wait
for the owner to leave.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.680
This is his chance.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.080
A real treasure - a scarlet heart.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.480
Got it!

20:28.640 --> 20:31.840
The stage is now set
for female visitors.

20:40.160 --> 20:42.520
His luck may be in.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.080
The seduction can now begin.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.880
He's showing off his best goods.

21:04.280 --> 21:07.160
Perhaps a little plastic piping?

21:09.800 --> 21:12.120
Or maybe a bit of coloured string?

21:16.520 --> 21:19.640
But his guest doesn't seem
to be paying much attention.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.080
A fork...

21:30.080 --> 21:31.440
madam?

21:34.440 --> 21:36.120
Nothing seems to be working.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.360
Something is just
not quite right here.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.640
But he still has one trick
up his sleeve -

21:52.640 --> 21:54.320
the scarlet heart.

22:19.040 --> 22:24.800
As a final thrill, he expands the
pink crest on the back of his head,

22:24.800 --> 22:26.640
the sign of his adulthood.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.720
But he's made a mistake.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.800
This is not a female,

22:33.800 --> 22:38.080
but a young male who hasn't yet
developed that head crest.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.600
And he's making off
with the scarlet heart.

22:43.400 --> 22:46.560
It's not easy finding sex
in the city.

22:50.720 --> 22:54.920
Raising a family in the city
is not easy either.

22:56.840 --> 22:59.040
It's springtime in Toronto

22:59.040 --> 23:01.920
and this mother raccoon
has exchanged

23:01.920 --> 23:04.560
her native treetops for rooftops.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.000
Since giving birth two months ago,

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
she's kept her offspring
safe and warm inside a chimney.

23:25.800 --> 23:29.000
Now, her young have outgrown
their nursery.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.680
This is her first major challenge
as a mother.

23:35.360 --> 23:38.760
The time has come
to move to a new home.

23:40.080 --> 23:43.080
She needs to get her youngster
to ground level.

23:45.560 --> 23:48.480
But, instead of an easy climb
down a tree,

23:48.480 --> 23:53.320
she is faced with a vertical drop
with little to cling onto.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.480
Her baby's first glimpse
of the urban world...

24:04.360 --> 24:06.840
..from a terrifying 30 feet up.

24:26.240 --> 24:28.760
RACCOON CUB WHINES

24:37.720 --> 24:40.840
This is the last of her litter
to be brought down.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.720
Its siblings are already busy
exploring the area.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.360
And they have much to learn.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.880
This one has fallen into
a back alley and is trapped.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.840
Mother comes to the rescue
and demonstrates what must be done.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.400
CUBS CHITTER

25:24.600 --> 25:26.200
That's the way.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.360
Raccoons are opportunists.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.840
And they're eager to explore.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.600
But they'll have to learn
very quickly

25:45.600 --> 25:50.200
how to get along in this
strange new environment,

25:50.200 --> 25:51.840
so full of hazards.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.240
Mother comes to the rescue
once more.

26:03.840 --> 26:08.200
Urban raccoons are now demonstrably
better at problem-solving

26:08.200 --> 26:09.840
than their country cousins.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.480
When the feeding opportunities
are this good,

26:19.480 --> 26:23.000
the time spent working out
how to get to it is well worth it.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.800
The complexity of urban life...

26:38.040 --> 26:39.480
..favours the clever.

26:48.080 --> 26:51.520
But to compete with humanity
during daylight hours

26:51.520 --> 26:53.560
takes more than just intelligence.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.400
It takes nerve.

27:02.560 --> 27:05.320
One enterprising species of monkey

27:05.320 --> 27:08.520
has moved into the city of Jaipur
in India...

27:11.760 --> 27:13.640
..the rhesus macaque.

27:18.400 --> 27:22.200
But how to get a share
of all this juicy fruit?

27:30.680 --> 27:34.120
Every morning,
the troop make the same journey

27:34.120 --> 27:37.520
through the urban jungle,
just as human commuters do.

28:00.120 --> 28:04.200
Sometimes, inevitably,
there are traffic jams.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.720
Once they get to the market,
trouble begins.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.520
Being both intelligent and brazen

28:55.520 --> 28:59.520
is the key to beating human beings
on their home turf.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.640
MAN SHOUTS

29:36.760 --> 29:38.720
It's daylight robbery.

29:49.240 --> 29:53.360
There are some animals that
most would consider too dangerous

29:53.360 --> 29:54.880
to tolerate in the city.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.280
Spotted hyenas.

30:01.280 --> 30:04.320
HYENAS HOWL

30:04.320 --> 30:06.560
They're feared
throughout their range.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.440
In the outskirts of Harar
in Ethiopia,

30:17.440 --> 30:22.400
two clans are coming face-to-face
to battle over a prized resource.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.920
There are about 60 hyenas
in each clan

30:30.920 --> 30:33.080
and they're well matched.

30:58.480 --> 31:01.960
After three hours of posturing
back and forth,

31:01.960 --> 31:06.280
the losers retreat and the victors
head to claim their prize.

31:12.720 --> 31:16.560
They have been fighting over
access to the city.

31:30.040 --> 31:34.440
Once inside the city walls,
they head for one place.

31:43.560 --> 31:46.160
And they know exactly
how to get there.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.320
HYENA GROWLS

32:18.320 --> 32:20.880
The ancient meat market.

32:24.040 --> 32:28.560
The scent of all these carcasses
lies heavy in the air.

32:50.920 --> 32:55.120
This tradition goes back
over 400 years.

32:55.120 --> 32:59.000
The human butchers put out the bones
they don't need

32:59.000 --> 33:01.680
and these hyenas deal with them.

33:03.920 --> 33:06.640
They're the only animals that can.

33:06.640 --> 33:10.760
No other here has such powerful,
bone-crushing jaws.

33:13.920 --> 33:17.000
And this relationship
between man and beast

33:17.000 --> 33:19.320
has now been taken a step further.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.240
HE WHISTLES

33:23.240 --> 33:27.320
Yusuf is calling the hyenas
to his house.

33:35.440 --> 33:39.360
He and his forefathers,
going back five generations,

33:39.360 --> 33:41.560
have been feeding the hyenas...

33:42.440 --> 33:43.680
..by hand.

33:45.760 --> 33:52.520
The inhabitants of this town believe
that hyenas provide

33:52.520 --> 33:57.200
eating the bad spirits
that haunt the streets.

34:03.520 --> 34:06.800
These are wild
and ferocious animals,

34:06.800 --> 34:09.400
but once within these city walls,

34:09.400 --> 34:12.239
they behave
in a completely different way.

34:14.239 --> 34:16.280
Throughout the rest of Africa,

34:16.280 --> 34:19.679
spotted hyenas are feared
because they kill livestock,

34:19.679 --> 34:21.239
sometimes even children.

34:23.239 --> 34:27.280
They are, perhaps, the most vilified
animal on our planet.

34:31.679 --> 34:33.960
However, here in Harar,

34:33.960 --> 34:37.280
their relationship with people
is entirely peaceful.

34:40.239 --> 34:42.719
They have won the trust of man.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.960
Losing its fear of humans

34:53.960 --> 34:58.240
has enabled one animal
to spread into cities everywhere,

34:58.240 --> 34:59.880
and in huge numbers.

35:07.680 --> 35:14.320
Pigeons are by far
the most successful urban bird.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.800
BELL TOLLS

35:18.480 --> 35:20.960
Here in Albi in the South of France,

35:20.960 --> 35:24.200
the pigeons come to the river
to bathe.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.760
They need to preen
their flight feathers,

35:26.760 --> 35:29.440
clean off the city dust...

35:29.440 --> 35:31.160
and cool themselves down.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.720
DRAMATIC MUSIC

35:52.200 --> 35:54.400
But death lies in wait.

35:56.800 --> 36:00.120
A predator that has taken advantage
of the very thing

36:00.120 --> 36:01.840
that has led
to the pigeon's success...

36:03.560 --> 36:05.440
..their lack of fear.

36:10.480 --> 36:14.760
oil from their plumage flows
downstream and is detected.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.960
A monstrous wels catfish.

36:31.440 --> 36:36.720
Introduced here just 40 years ago,
they have proliferated...

36:38.040 --> 36:40.880
..virtually exterminated
the local fish stocks...

36:42.880 --> 36:46.320
..and they've now developed
a taste for pigeon.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.120
Their eyesight is poor,

36:51.120 --> 36:55.240
so they use their barbels to sense
the movements of their victims.

37:50.440 --> 37:53.720
This is a radical
new hunting strategy

37:53.720 --> 37:56.720
for what is normally
a bottom-dwelling fish.

38:11.440 --> 38:14.720
After 1,000 years of living
in this city,

38:14.720 --> 38:19.320
pigeons are now having to learn
to avoid a fish.

38:25.320 --> 38:29.960
Our cities are always changing,
sometimes very swiftly.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.560
And animals must cope
with the changes...

38:35.560 --> 38:37.040
or disappear.

38:39.200 --> 38:42.360
One of the greatest changes
in recent times

38:42.360 --> 38:47.440
has come from a single invention
made less than 140 years ago.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.320
Electric light.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.880
It has become
more and more powerful...

39:00.560 --> 39:02.680
..filling our streets with light.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.720
It's everywhere in the city.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.000
It even goes underground.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.600
The difference between day and night

39:41.600 --> 39:44.160
is becoming
less and less perceptible.

39:53.840 --> 40:03.360
And that has a profound effect
on the activities of wildlife.

40:03.360 --> 40:07.720
In the wilderness, light triggers
all kinds of behaviour.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.600
On the night of the full moon,

40:15.600 --> 40:18.920
hundreds of tiny
hawksbill turtle hatchlings

40:18.920 --> 40:22.240
emerge from the safety
of their nests deep in the sand.

40:25.040 --> 40:28.680
Their instinct is to reach the sea
as quickly as possible.

40:30.880 --> 40:35.880
And their guide is the light of the
full moon reflected on the water.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.560
But this young hatchling
is confused.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.520
It's going in the wrong direction.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.120
Bright light is coming
from the land...

41:05.120 --> 41:06.800
LOUD MUSIC PLAYS IN DISTANCE

41:08.200 --> 41:12.760
..and all these hatchlings are
travelling up the beach towards it.

41:18.760 --> 41:21.920
Predators are ready
to take advantage.

41:23.640 --> 41:28.160
Crabs now make their burrows
directly beneath the beach lights

41:28.160 --> 41:31.000
and wait for their prey
to come to them.

41:53.320 --> 41:57.600
Even if a hatchling escapes,
they're still in peril.

42:06.160 --> 42:09.480
The lights become
more and more bewildering.

42:33.080 --> 42:36.720
80% of all hatchlings on this beach

42:36.720 --> 42:40.280
are now disorientated
by the lights of the town.

43:00.440 --> 43:03.440
Roads bring many to their end.

43:18.160 --> 43:22.080
Hundreds get trapped in storm drains
every night.

43:36.120 --> 43:37.800
Exhausted by the effort

43:37.800 --> 43:40.400
of travelling such a distance
on land...

43:42.680 --> 43:46.880
..this hatchling's chances of
surviving the night are slim.

43:59.480 --> 44:02.360
This turtle is one
of the countless species

44:02.360 --> 44:05.520
that have been unable to adapt
to the change

44:05.520 --> 44:08.240
brought about
by the urban environment.

44:19.840 --> 44:21.920
Only a small number of animals

44:21.920 --> 44:25.040
have managed to find ways
of living alongside us.

44:27.840 --> 44:31.720
And every ten years,
an area the size of Britain

44:31.720 --> 44:34.840
disappears under a jungle
of concrete.

44:44.160 --> 44:47.000
But it doesn't have to be
like this.

44:50.120 --> 44:54.760
Could it not be possible to build
cities more in harmony with nature?

45:02.280 --> 45:06.920
How, and whether, we decide
to invite the wildlife back

45:06.920 --> 45:08.360
is up to us.

45:12.080 --> 45:15.440
This tree is rising
nearly 30 storeys.

45:15.440 --> 45:18.320
It's one of almost 800 being planted

45:18.320 --> 45:21.360
to create a vertical forest
in Milan.

45:27.360 --> 45:32.000
This number of living trees

45:32.000 --> 45:35.080
but here, they occupy
one tenth of that area.

45:37.400 --> 45:40.080
Greening the walls and roofs
of our buildings

45:40.080 --> 45:47.960
could create a rich and extensive
habitat if we wanted it to do so.

45:47.960 --> 45:53.080
There is one city where that idea
is being applied on a major scale -

45:53.080 --> 45:54.680
Singapore.

45:56.440 --> 46:01.200
Two million trees have been
planted here in the last 45 years.

46:02.880 --> 46:07.480
This city is now richer in species
than any other in the world.

46:14.160 --> 46:17.760
And this practice extends
to all parts of the city.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.680
The waterways have been cleaned up

46:21.680 --> 46:24.200
and smooth-coated otters
are coming back.

46:30.520 --> 46:35.280
But perhaps the most spectacular
example of city greening

46:35.280 --> 46:41.280
is this grove of super trees.

46:41.280 --> 46:47.560
These 150-feet-high metal structures
are now full of life.

46:49.120 --> 46:53.160
Creepers have been planted to grow
over the outermost branches.

46:56.160 --> 46:58.920
This is a new urban world

46:58.920 --> 47:02.000
that we have now designed
and built

47:02.000 --> 47:04.040
with others in mind.

47:06.760 --> 47:08.640
Create the space

47:08.640 --> 47:10.520
and the animals will come.

47:18.960 --> 47:22.280
Is this a vision of our cities
of the future?

47:31.240 --> 47:35.680
It could be possible to see wildlife
thriving within our cities

47:35.680 --> 47:37.560
across the planet.

47:40.480 --> 47:44.720
We, after all, are the architects
of the urban world.

47:46.160 --> 47:49.880
Now, over half of us live
in an urban environment.

47:49.880 --> 47:53.080
My home, too, is here
in the city of London.

47:54.320 --> 47:56.760
Looking down
on this great metropolis,

47:56.760 --> 48:01.440
the ingenuity with which we continue
to reshape the surface of our planet

48:01.440 --> 48:03.280
is very striking.

48:03.280 --> 48:05.560
But it's also sobering.

48:05.560 --> 48:09.040
It reminds me of just
how easy it is for us

48:09.040 --> 48:11.760
to lose our connection
with the natural world.

48:12.960 --> 48:17.680
Yet it's on this connection
that the future of both humanity

48:17.680 --> 48:20.000
and the natural world will depend.

48:21.200 --> 48:26.400
It's surely our responsibility
to do everything within our power

48:26.400 --> 48:30.920
to create a planet that provides
a home not just for us,

48:30.920 --> 48:33.520
but for all life on Earth.

49:17.680 --> 49:19.640
For a wildlife film crew,

49:19.640 --> 49:24.840
working in the urban environment was
an altogether different experience.

49:24.840 --> 49:28.760
Two crews set off
on two very different missions.

49:28.760 --> 49:32.040
It's Mark and Louis's
first time in India.

49:32.040 --> 49:34.640
Bus, there's mopeds, and we're
not stopping, we're going...

49:34.640 --> 49:39.120
Oh, my God!

49:40.880 --> 49:42.720
Along with the rest of the team,

49:42.720 --> 49:45.320
they hope to film
up close and personal

49:45.320 --> 49:47.680
with the monkeys
that have come from the wild

49:47.680 --> 49:50.040
to live in the hustle and bustle
of the city.

49:51.960 --> 49:55.040
I can't believe these macaques
have left the peace and quiet

49:55.040 --> 49:57.120
for this mayhem,
but they're fine here.

49:57.120 --> 49:59.080
In fact, they're probably
a bit more comfortable

49:59.080 --> 50:00.400
than I am with this noise.

50:00.400 --> 50:01.880
CAR HORN BLARES
Yeah, yeah.

50:03.760 --> 50:07.680
And to get into the monkey's world,
Mark will be using a new rig

50:07.680 --> 50:09.600
that stabilises the camera

50:09.600 --> 50:11.960
and allows him to get
right into the action.

50:14.280 --> 50:16.920
I think Mark and Louis
have got a big challenge

50:16.920 --> 50:20.240
to be wielding thousands of pounds'
worth of camera equipment

50:20.240 --> 50:21.840
down at the street level.

50:21.840 --> 50:23.840
Rather them than me!

50:23.840 --> 50:28.120
You've got a lady with cauliflowers
passing on your left, Mark.

50:28.120 --> 50:31.040
Just pull me aside.
On your left.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.280
I'm more used to a jungle,
if I'm honest!

50:34.600 --> 50:38.240
But this is a jungle all of its own,
just with people instead of trees.

50:38.240 --> 50:39.600
It's impossible!

50:41.360 --> 50:43.760
700 miles south in Mumbai,

50:43.760 --> 50:46.560
cameraman Gordon Buchanan
will have to take on

50:46.560 --> 50:48.680
a completely different
filming approach

50:48.680 --> 50:51.560
if he's to capture
an urban leopard hunt.

50:54.880 --> 50:57.480
It's amazing to think that standing
here, surrounded by people,

50:57.480 --> 51:01.600
all this kind of human activity,
that within...

51:01.600 --> 51:05.480
half a mile, maybe even less,
there will be leopards.

51:05.480 --> 51:09.600
Only glimpses of these cats
have been caught on camera

51:09.600 --> 51:13.600
and just to locate them, he'll need
new infrared camera traps.

51:13.600 --> 51:15.440
Are you happy with the composition?

51:15.440 --> 51:17.240
Good. What about you?

51:17.240 --> 51:19.040
Right. Correct shutter speed?

51:19.040 --> 51:20.720
CHILD LAUGHS

51:20.720 --> 51:24.160
Gordon is hoping
that these camera traps will reveal

51:24.160 --> 51:25.960
where they're on the prowl.

51:30.760 --> 51:38.640
For the monkey team,
finding the animals seems easy...

51:42.080 --> 51:43.440
Almost started on that.

51:43.440 --> 51:46.720
Ooh! They didn't put that
on the hazard assessment!

51:46.720 --> 51:48.400
They did as a matter of fact.
Cow in the groin?

51:48.400 --> 51:50.280
Cow in the groin.

51:50.280 --> 51:53.560
They're much tougher and more
granitey than the monkeys

51:53.560 --> 51:56.640
I've filmed in the wild.
They're not frightened of us.

51:56.640 --> 51:59.080
They're, um, I mean look at this.

52:00.240 --> 52:03.680
He's taking on pigs, he's taking
on goats, he's taking on cows,

52:03.680 --> 52:05.800
he's taking on me
any time he wants to.

52:05.800 --> 52:09.040
But with monkeys this brazen,

52:09.040 --> 52:11.760
Mark is able to follow the troop
at street level.

52:14.840 --> 52:18.000
To capture their movements
in their rooftop world,

52:18.000 --> 52:22.720
they need to run a cable between
buildings and fly a camera along it

52:22.720 --> 52:26.360
and that calls for
some inventive rigging.

52:28.720 --> 52:30.960
I've got this soft satsuma here

52:30.960 --> 52:35.440
and I've got to lob it to the team
on the other side over there.

52:35.440 --> 52:37.480
We're going to lob it
from rooftop to rooftop.

52:37.480 --> 52:41.520
We've made sure there's no-one on
the rooftops and it's safe to do it.

52:41.520 --> 52:43.560
Are you ready? OK.

52:48.920 --> 52:50.280
OK. Good.

52:50.280 --> 52:52.720
That's good.
I got it into the courtyard.

52:52.720 --> 52:53.920
So, that's perfect.

52:55.920 --> 52:58.560
I think our cable run at the moment
is about 60 metres.

53:00.120 --> 53:02.760
We can travel the whole length
while panning and tilting

53:02.760 --> 53:04.680
and really looking at everything
we want to.

53:04.680 --> 53:07.360
It should give us
some really dynamic, stunning shots.

53:07.360 --> 53:10.760
The team is getting
an insight at all levels

53:10.760 --> 53:13.320
into the monkeys'
mischievous lives...

53:22.600 --> 53:28.840
..and are starting to figure out the
routes they use to cross the city.

53:28.840 --> 53:30.400
And over the course of weeks,

53:30.400 --> 53:33.480
the macaques become all too familiar
with the crew.

53:33.480 --> 53:35.960
All right, little monkey!

53:35.960 --> 53:37.800
All right, little monkey.
All right.

53:39.640 --> 53:42.000
They're now fully embedded
in the troop

53:42.000 --> 53:44.920
and Mark is able to film
right amongst them.

53:44.920 --> 53:47.200
These guys at the moment are magic.

53:47.200 --> 53:50.280
We've got monkeys behaving
naturally, it's fantastic.

53:53.240 --> 53:56.280
That's good, Louis. Very nice, guys.
Thank you. Very nice.

53:57.480 --> 54:00.320
Back in Mumbai,
the camera traps are revealing

54:00.320 --> 54:02.520
where the leopards are coming out.

54:04.760 --> 54:08.400
But to stand any chance of capturing
them hunting in the city,

54:08.400 --> 54:12.280
Gordon will need to use the latest
thermal camera technology.

54:16.600 --> 54:19.160
BAND PLAYS

54:25.880 --> 54:27.040
FIREWORK EXPLODES

54:28.760 --> 54:31.200
(WHISPERING) I can't imagine
that leopard's going to come

54:31.200 --> 54:32.440
with all this going on.

54:34.400 --> 54:37.920
Relative silence
eventually descends.

54:37.920 --> 54:42.200
OK, I picked up some movement
behind some bushes on the camera.

54:42.200 --> 54:44.320
It's just a sort of
a twinkling of light.

54:44.320 --> 54:46.040
It's something warm-blooded.

54:48.680 --> 54:50.160
There we go.

54:52.360 --> 54:54.000
A leopard.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.520
You dancer! Look at that!

54:58.560 --> 55:00.800
It definitely knows that I'm here.

55:02.760 --> 55:05.320
That's a type of sighting
that you'd have to wait

55:05.320 --> 55:08.040
for weeks and weeks
to get a leopard that close.

55:08.040 --> 55:10.200
And so early on.

55:11.840 --> 55:13.320
Over the next month,

55:13.320 --> 55:16.480
this camera enables Gordon
to see into the darkness

55:16.480 --> 55:21.000
and be the first person
to film an urban leopard hunt.

55:24.160 --> 55:26.440
But it's only at the end of the trip

55:26.440 --> 55:29.200
that he has
his most memorable encounter.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.920
(WHISPERING) Look at the size
of him!

55:32.480 --> 55:35.480
He's coming up. He's coming up.
He's coming up.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.120
My goodness, look at that!

55:40.120 --> 55:42.920
He's about three metres
in front of me.

55:45.800 --> 55:47.320
Jesus!

56:13.320 --> 56:15.200
My heart is racing!

56:16.600 --> 56:18.360
That was close!

56:21.640 --> 56:24.360
That's the closest
I've ever been to a leopard.

56:28.840 --> 56:32.360
That's often the case
with urban wildlife,

56:32.360 --> 56:35.400
is that it's the presence
of human beings

56:35.400 --> 56:39.000
that allows certain animals
to do well.

56:40.160 --> 56:42.960
And I suppose it's just incredible

56:42.960 --> 56:46.360
that one of those animals
is the leopard.

56:52.600 --> 56:55.040
It isn't just Gordon
getting an insight

56:55.040 --> 56:58.720
into the surprising wildlife
encounters possible in the city.

57:00.200 --> 57:02.800
It's in Jodhpur,
filming the langurs,

57:02.800 --> 57:07.040
that the monkey team really see
the extraordinary relationship

57:07.040 --> 57:10.080
between humans and animals
in Indian cities.

57:10.080 --> 57:12.200
They're so tolerant,
they're amazing.

57:17.520 --> 57:20.520
And it makes a strong impression
on them.

57:20.520 --> 57:21.680
Oh, it's beautiful.

57:22.960 --> 57:24.360
Yeah, that is beautiful.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
I mean, coming to India,
this is what you realise,

57:29.000 --> 57:34.200
that if you let your wildlife into
the city and you really embrace it,

57:34.200 --> 57:36.680
then this is the reward you get.

57:36.680 --> 57:41.960
I mean, this phenomenal connection
with incredible creatures,

57:41.960 --> 57:44.720
and that...that just feels
wonderful.

57:45.960 --> 57:48.520
It was a surprising revelation

57:48.520 --> 57:51.480
that it was in cities
where the film crews

57:51.480 --> 57:55.680
had some of their most extraordinary
encounters with wild animals.
