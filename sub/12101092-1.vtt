- Alright, should we get it?
- Yes.

01:51.496 --> 01:52.298
Alright, let's go.

01:54.066 --> 01:55.734
Big MariNaomi fans?

01:55.768 --> 01:57.302
Have you read her graphic
memoirs?

01:57.335 --> 01:58.536
They're freakin' amazin'.

01:58.569 --> 02:00.338
Are you taking her class this
summer?

02:00.371 --> 02:01.706
- Her what?
- Her what?

02:01.739 --> 02:02.574
Yeah.

02:04.043 --> 02:06.446
Dude, you have to take
the class.

02:07.346 --> 02:09.716
Unless they offer scholarships,
there's no way.

02:10.649 --> 02:12.451
Alright, thank you.

02:13.885 --> 02:15.554
Just ask your parents
for the money, just another run

02:15.586 --> 02:16.621
on the American team.

02:16.655 --> 02:17.956
Do you even know my parents?

02:17.990 --> 02:20.727
They won't loan me $500
for a graphic novel class.

02:21.627 --> 02:23.763
Tell them it's for some college
credit or something.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.463
They're not stupid.

02:25.497 --> 02:27.667
♪ Bad, bad girls ♪

02:28.766 --> 02:30.068
Oh, we could rob a bank.

02:30.102 --> 02:32.504
We already did that in seventh
grade, remember?

02:32.538 --> 02:33.005
We did?

02:33.038 --> 02:33.706
Yes.

02:39.578 --> 02:41.013
Oh, wait, look how cute our
handwriting was

02:41.045 --> 02:42.681
in second grade.

02:42.715 --> 02:43.883
There, see?

02:43.915 --> 02:44.883
Rob a bank.

02:44.917 --> 02:46.018
Oh, too bad.

02:46.050 --> 02:47.485
That would have been
a perfect way to pay

02:47.519 --> 02:49.355
MariNaomi's class.

02:49.388 --> 02:49.956
Yeah.

02:52.724 --> 02:54.693
Oh, Vicky and Veronica could
sell drugs.

02:54.727 --> 02:55.593
Oh no.

02:55.627 --> 02:56.594
No, no, no, no, no.

02:56.627 --> 02:59.431
Veronica would never do that and
neither would I.

02:59.465 --> 03:01.599
Alright, well ergo the name,
the never list.

03:01.633 --> 03:03.069
It's unlike you know,
we're gonna do any of this shit

03:03.102 --> 03:04.337
in real life.

03:04.370 --> 03:06.872
Yeah, but still I would never do
that.

03:10.074 --> 03:11.576
Pot's legal now.

03:11.610 --> 03:12.345
How about that?

03:15.114 --> 03:16.782
Okay, fine.

03:16.814 --> 03:19.018
- Fine.
- Okay, okay, okay.

03:19.050 --> 03:21.820
Okay, so we have Vicky and
Veronica sneaking out of school.

03:21.854 --> 03:22.522
Mmhmm.

03:22.555 --> 03:24.824
Stealing a car to get a tattoo,

03:24.856 --> 03:26.959
sell drugs, get in a fight.

03:26.991 --> 03:29.394
Yeah, because somebody pinched
the wrong guy's ass.

03:29.927 --> 03:31.496
We are so bad.

03:32.230 --> 03:34.032
No, Vicky and Veronica are bad.

03:34.066 --> 03:34.933
Yeah.

03:36.835 --> 03:38.504
Oh crap!

03:38.537 --> 03:39.671
We should go, Theo's game ends
in like 10 minutes.

03:39.705 --> 03:40.539
Okay, yeah.

03:40.572 --> 03:41.039
Yeah.

03:54.118 --> 03:56.622
Oh my God.

03:56.655 --> 03:57.622
What?

04:09.168 --> 04:11.938
You're so lucky, you live across
the street from Joey Soria.

04:12.905 --> 04:15.707
I guess I'm not
into the drug-dealer type.

04:16.942 --> 04:18.177
You coming in?

04:18.209 --> 04:19.945
No, I can't.

04:19.978 --> 04:21.480
I gotta sit in the car, sorry.
I'll FaceTime you, though.

04:22.915 --> 04:24.182
Okay.

04:24.216 --> 04:25.418
Bye.

04:26.185 --> 04:27.120
Bye.

04:33.492 --> 04:34.660
Oh, oh, oh, hey.

04:41.867 --> 04:42.735
Hey, I'm home.

04:42.767 --> 04:44.035
Hey, kiddo.

04:44.069 --> 04:45.704
Oh, the props for your
presentation are on your bed.

04:45.737 --> 04:47.006
We can practice again after
dinner.

04:47.038 --> 04:48.740
Okay. Great.

04:50.975 --> 04:52.711
It's looking good.
How's the salad?

04:52.744 --> 04:53.880
Yeah, it's fine.

04:55.514 --> 04:58.451
With its palm-tree-laden beaches
and warm island charm,

04:58.483 --> 05:00.718
Hawaii is one of the most
beautiful places on Earth.

05:00.752 --> 05:02.555
How about most beautiful and
enchanting?

05:03.754 --> 05:05.690
Mom, I'll sound like a travel
brochure.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.225
What do you think
travel brochures are for?

05:07.259 --> 05:09.228
It's to sell plane tickets.

05:09.261 --> 05:11.497
It's the same principle,
only instead of plane tickets

05:11.529 --> 05:12.497
it's spring dance tickets.

05:12.531 --> 05:13.733
Ooh, how about these two?

05:14.966 --> 05:17.068
No, I was planning on wearing
a Hawaiian top

05:17.101 --> 05:18.703
with a grass green skirt
to fit the theme.

05:18.737 --> 05:19.805
Oh, that is way too silly.

05:19.838 --> 05:21.140
You need to dress to impress.

05:21.173 --> 05:22.007
Show me your poster.

05:25.677 --> 05:26.645
I think you're gonna be proud.

05:30.548 --> 05:32.550
Hmm, okay, um,

05:32.584 --> 05:35.221
you know, the drawing
is cute, but

05:35.254 --> 05:36.922
But what?

05:36.954 --> 05:39.959
Well, you know, it's just not
professional.

05:39.992 --> 05:42.895
You really need photos to sell
the beauty of Hawaii

05:42.927 --> 05:44.829
and we have a lot of photos
from all the trips

05:44.862 --> 05:46.764
to Chi Chan and Bi Chan.

05:46.798 --> 05:49.601
I know the perfect photos for
you to use!

05:52.103 --> 05:53.906
You did a great job, Eva.

05:58.043 --> 05:58.944
Whatever.

05:59.812 --> 06:02.882
The first comics
that I ever got into was

06:02.915 --> 06:05.784
when I was in my early 20s,
and I came across the whole

06:05.817 --> 06:08.853
kind of Riot Grrrl zine type
thing,

06:08.887 --> 06:11.524
and a lot of them were people
telling their stories.

06:11.557 --> 06:14.126
After a while I realized, hey,
I have stories, too,

06:14.158 --> 06:15.760
and I love to draw, and I love
to write.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.597
to get into that.

06:28.906 --> 06:30.875
I wish today was over already.

06:30.908 --> 06:32.010
Look, you're gonna be fine.

06:32.043 --> 06:33.545
Just picture everybody naked.

06:33.579 --> 06:35.281
Oh yeah, like that'll make me
less nervous.

06:35.314 --> 06:37.182
It will, I've done it.

06:37.214 --> 06:38.850
I thought of something new for
the list.

06:38.884 --> 06:39.752
You ready?

06:39.985 --> 06:41.187
Be rock stars.

06:42.086 --> 06:43.555
Be rock stars?

06:44.189 --> 06:45.758
Yes!

06:45.790 --> 06:48.326
Yes, can you just like imagine
we're up on stage,

06:48.360 --> 06:49.995
and everybody's in the crowd,
and we're like

06:50.028 --> 06:52.331
♪ Yeah, dancing, dancing ♪

06:52.363 --> 06:54.899
♪ Dancing till the world ends ♪

06:54.932 --> 06:56.200
♪ Whoa ♪

06:56.233 --> 06:58.169
Hey, do not give me that look!

06:58.202 --> 07:01.139
I know I'm terrible and you're
afraid of your own shadow.

07:01.173 --> 07:04.043
We would never do it, but Vicky
and Veronica totally

07:04.076 --> 07:05.945
would and they would rock.

07:07.045 --> 07:08.614
Like seriously, they would rock.

07:09.982 --> 07:12.785
You would rock, right,
but I will not rock.

07:24.096 --> 07:26.798
Alright,
particularly good work from Eva Jeffries.

07:27.798 --> 07:30.135
And Joey Soria.

07:30.836 --> 07:32.605
And Joey actually showed up.

07:33.505 --> 07:34.973
Uh, pretty sure I've been here
every day

07:35.007 --> 07:36.108
for like two whole weeks now.

07:36.141 --> 07:38.143
Oh, like two weeks now?
Two weeks now?

07:38.175 --> 07:41.012
All I know Taylor is that he got
an A.

08:10.341 --> 08:13.079
Hawaii is a land rich with
history and tradition.

08:14.446 --> 08:17.216
With its palm-tree-laden beaches
and warm island charm,

08:17.249 --> 08:20.019
Hawaii is one of the most
beautiful

08:21.452 --> 08:23.855
beautiful and exotic
places on Earth.

08:25.290 --> 08:27.992
That is why I am proposing that
our junior prom theme

08:28.026 --> 08:29.362
be Hawaiian Aloha.

08:31.062 --> 08:33.998
Um, so I've brought some props

08:34.030 --> 08:36.366
to go with that theme.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.702
Who wants a lei?

08:37.735 --> 08:38.669
What's up with her?

08:41.472 --> 08:43.975
Alright, calm down, everyone.

08:44.009 --> 08:45.043
Settle down.

08:46.311 --> 08:48.980
Thank you for a fantastic
presentation, Eva.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.216
Or should I say mahalo?

08:54.019 --> 08:55.086
Okay!

08:55.120 --> 08:56.922
We have a few more themes
to get through

08:56.955 --> 08:59.725
and then we will vote
on one next week.

08:59.758 --> 09:02.261
So get your pencils ready.

09:03.729 --> 09:05.397
Maybe use those pencils to do
your homework.

09:05.429 --> 09:06.831
Hey, that'll be a plus, huh?

09:07.765 --> 09:08.733
Can you imagine?

09:10.434 --> 09:11.335
Here, let me help you.

09:11.369 --> 09:12.437
Okay.

09:13.105 --> 09:16.041
I've been meaning to ask you do
you have any thoughts

09:16.073 --> 09:18.710
on who should run for senior
class president next year?

09:18.744 --> 09:19.979
I was thinking Ben.

09:21.278 --> 09:24.115
Yeah, I mean Ben's great,
but so far

09:25.884 --> 09:28.320
he's the only one who signed up
and in order for it

09:28.352 --> 09:30.955
to be a true election,
we need more than one candidate,

09:30.989 --> 09:32.057
don't you think?

09:33.491 --> 09:35.126
Are you talking about me?

09:36.761 --> 09:38.029
Secretary looks good on your
college application,

09:38.062 --> 09:39.197
but president

09:41.966 --> 09:43.001
That looks better.

09:43.869 --> 09:44.769
Just sayin'.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.107
Focus.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.776
We need to add something
to the list.

10:24.809 --> 10:27.011
How about we kick Ben Hallster
in the nuts?

10:28.580 --> 10:30.516
Upset with Mr. Hallster, are we?

10:30.548 --> 10:31.949
Yeah, he's a jerk.

10:33.317 --> 10:36.020
Yeah, but kicking somebody in
the sweets?

10:36.053 --> 10:37.490
Like Veronica's more creative
than that.

10:38.355 --> 10:39.224
Let's think.

10:39.256 --> 10:40.925
Uh, Ben is a

10:40.958 --> 10:42.426
Cocky little jerk.

10:42.460 --> 10:43.394
Okay, cocky.

10:43.427 --> 10:45.163
Um, uh

10:46.565 --> 10:48.100
I got it.

10:48.133 --> 10:50.469
Veronica could put Viagra in his
drink like right before

10:50.501 --> 10:51.836
a class presentation.

10:51.870 --> 10:53.304
That is awful.

10:53.337 --> 10:55.339
Yeah, but if he's ever a jerk to
you again, you can be like,

10:55.373 --> 10:56.542
At least,
I didn't get a little boner

10:56.575 --> 10:58.443
in front of the whole class.

10:58.475 --> 10:59.945
- Okay, add it.
- Okay, okay.

11:01.245 --> 11:02.447
That's gonna be so good.

11:03.181 --> 11:03.815
Okay.

11:03.849 --> 11:05.250
Okay, going to fix your hair.

11:05.283 --> 11:06.918
Mmhmm, I like it, this

11:08.385 --> 11:09.587
Get the list!

11:09.620 --> 11:10.855
- Give it to us!
- Give it!

11:10.889 --> 11:11.889
Ow!

11:11.923 --> 11:14.426
Mom, Liz is hurting me!

11:14.458 --> 11:16.828
What is going on up here?

11:16.861 --> 11:19.865
Mom, he came into my room and
stole our papers.

11:19.898 --> 11:22.533
They're supposed to be doin'
homework, not their stupid hair.

11:22.567 --> 11:24.970
Enough, both of you.

11:25.803 --> 11:28.005
Eva, you're goin' to have
to go home,

11:28.038 --> 11:29.875
things have gotten a little out
of control here.

11:29.908 --> 11:31.576
Yes, ma'am.

11:31.610 --> 11:34.046
Liz, aren't you supposed to be
at the Millers in an hour?

11:35.580 --> 11:37.115
Go.

11:37.148 --> 11:38.082
Theo, no!

11:40.217 --> 11:42.987
Well, no, it is a lot of
work, but it is so worth it.

11:43.020 --> 11:44.622
It's so fun, too.

11:44.655 --> 11:47.592
You know, being class president
helped me get a scholarship,

11:47.625 --> 11:49.961
without which I would not have
met your dad and you

11:49.995 --> 11:51.395
would not be sitting here
right now.

11:51.428 --> 11:53.631
So for the sake of
your future grandchildren,

11:53.664 --> 11:56.100
you better come up with a damn
good campaign slogan.

11:56.134 --> 11:57.034
Okay.

11:57.067 --> 11:57.968
Yeah.

11:58.003 --> 12:00.372
Mock me all you want, but
Stanford tuition?

12:00.404 --> 12:01.572
No joke.

12:01.605 --> 12:03.307
So who are you running against?

12:03.341 --> 12:05.409
Ben Hallster.

12:05.442 --> 12:07.312
As in Congressman Hallster's
son?

12:07.345 --> 12:10.148
Yep, he's a sniveling jerk.

12:10.181 --> 12:12.618
Okay, a true leader doesn't
resort to name-calling,

12:12.650 --> 12:14.886
they lead by example.

12:14.919 --> 12:17.322
Even when your opponent
is a bully?

12:17.355 --> 12:18.423
Especially then.

12:21.692 --> 12:23.062
Okay.

12:39.177 --> 12:40.012
Oh my God.

12:44.115 --> 12:45.317
Did you see it?

12:45.350 --> 12:47.152
I cannot believe MariNaomi just
liked my tweet.

12:49.053 --> 12:50.923
See, okay, now, you have to ask
your parents for the money.

12:51.722 --> 12:53.357
I don't know.

12:53.390 --> 12:55.693
Eva, are you seriously gonna let
an opportunity pass

12:55.726 --> 12:58.029
like this without even
trying?

12:59.530 --> 13:01.132
Crap, the Millers are home.

13:01.166 --> 13:02.567
I gotta go, but I'm serious.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.235
Ask your parents.

13:04.269 --> 13:05.671
Okay, maybe.

13:05.703 --> 13:07.171
Bye.

Why didn't you wake me up?

14:07.097 --> 14:09.333
Uh

14:09.366 --> 14:11.469
Mom, what's wrong?

14:11.503 --> 14:14.373
We got a call earlier this
morning.

14:14.405 --> 14:16.707
Is it GeeJaan?

14:16.740 --> 14:19.443
No, no, it's not any of your
grandparents.

14:19.476 --> 14:22.113
Um,

14:22.147 --> 14:24.016
it's Liz.

14:25.049 --> 14:26.418
What about Liz?

14:29.586 --> 14:30.521
Uh

14:42.667 --> 14:44.469
Attention students and staff,

14:44.501 --> 14:46.237
we have a special
announcement.

14:48.206 --> 14:50.741
It is with deepest sorrow

14:50.774 --> 14:53.411
that I must bring news
of the

14:53.445 --> 14:56.081
unexpected passing of
one of our students,

14:56.114 --> 14:58.684
Elizabeth Mears, following a car
accident last night.

15:03.087 --> 15:05.356
School counselors are on hand
for any student

15:05.389 --> 15:07.759
who may need help dealing with
this sudden

15:07.792 --> 15:09.461
and tragic loss.

15:28.846 --> 15:31.649
We were just hanging out in gym
class the other day and then

15:34.451 --> 15:36.620
Next day she's gone.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.664
I didn't know they were friends.

15:46.697 --> 15:48.332
They weren't.

15:57.174 --> 15:58.209
What?

15:58.243 --> 15:59.611
I'm grieving.

16:02.714 --> 16:04.249
Alright.

16:09.854 --> 16:11.256
Taylor, you ready to go?

16:11.288 --> 16:12.323
Hell, yes.

16:12.356 --> 16:14.525
This shit is depressing.

16:14.558 --> 16:16.760
Hey, do you wanna come?

16:16.793 --> 16:19.663
Yeah, you should
totally come.

16:19.697 --> 16:21.133
Where?

16:21.166 --> 16:22.734
Just goin' to
the park to toast Liz.

16:22.767 --> 16:24.570
Feel like you should be there.

16:26.671 --> 16:29.141
I better stay.

16:29.173 --> 16:30.241
Okay.

16:36.346 --> 16:37.582
Wait!

16:43.254 --> 16:45.690
I mean this is crazy, right?

16:45.722 --> 16:48.492
Everybody is like crying and
making such a big deal

16:48.525 --> 16:49.760
out of this, you know?

16:49.793 --> 16:52.230
But we know that it's bullshit.

16:52.263 --> 16:54.232
'Cause they didn't know her.

16:54.264 --> 16:57.168
Exactly, they didn't know her.

16:57.201 --> 16:59.138
Not like we did.

17:03.307 --> 17:05.309
No, no, no, you were the one
who was pimping me out to

17:05.342 --> 17:06.944
that guy for his
Chuck E. Cheese ticket.

17:06.977 --> 17:08.679
He had a shitload of tickets.

17:08.712 --> 17:11.348
I mean all you had to do was
just talk him up a little bit.

17:11.382 --> 17:13.751
Whose party was this?

17:14.519 --> 17:16.221
I have no idea.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.820
There were so many parties at
Chuck E. Cheese,

17:17.855 --> 17:19.490
I could not keep them straight
if I tried.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.560
Why did we all stop hanging out?

17:25.797 --> 17:28.732
Um, well, we got older.

17:28.766 --> 17:31.736
Things changed.

17:31.769 --> 17:33.270
Joey became a delinquent.

17:36.907 --> 17:39.610
But you and
Liz, you never changed.

17:41.346 --> 17:44.215
Always perfect, smart, never got
in trouble.

17:45.849 --> 17:47.952
I couldn't live up to that.

17:47.986 --> 17:50.322
So I focused on what
I'm good at.

17:50.355 --> 17:53.258
Seriously?

17:53.290 --> 17:54.458
I thought you guys stopped
hanging out,

17:54.491 --> 17:57.361
because we weren't cool enough
or something.

17:57.394 --> 17:58.496
Yes, that, too.

18:05.769 --> 18:07.772
I wish we had done more things
like this

18:10.407 --> 18:12.409
instead of being so

18:12.442 --> 18:13.478
Goody-goody?

18:13.510 --> 18:16.447
- Come on.
- No, she's right.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.650
What were we so afraid of?

18:20.751 --> 18:22.787
Not getting a good grade

18:22.819 --> 18:24.822
or not getting into
the right school?

18:24.855 --> 18:27.325
Disappointing our parents?

18:27.357 --> 18:30.394
Liz did everything, right?

18:30.428 --> 18:33.031
She did everything she was
supposed to.

18:33.064 --> 18:34.800
For what?

18:37.402 --> 18:39.004
It's all bullshit.

18:39.037 --> 18:40.538
So what?

18:40.570 --> 18:41.572
You're gonna do a bunch of
stupid stuff,

18:41.605 --> 18:43.540
because your best friend died?

18:43.574 --> 18:44.776
Maybe.

18:48.078 --> 18:50.848
Well, you could start by
whoa, okay.

18:50.882 --> 18:52.917
You could start by failing the
lit test on Friday.

18:54.585 --> 18:57.454
And you always seriously mess up
the curve.

20:13.765 --> 20:16.768
The first is shocked
and then denial,

what you're goin' through now.

20:23.441 --> 20:26.044

Eyes closed, eyes closed.

23:29.961 --> 23:31.095
No, I have to do the calculus.

23:31.127 --> 23:31.862
No, you don't.

23:33.497 --> 23:34.766

Mm-mm, we're almost there.

23:36.032 --> 23:36.967
Okay.

23:38.035 --> 23:40.971
Hey, and open.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.608
What is this?

23:44.642 --> 23:46.210
Just a little place I like
to sneak away

23:46.242 --> 23:49.179
to when I need to clear
my head.

23:49.212 --> 23:51.615
Taylor, are you insane?

23:51.648 --> 23:52.349
I can get expelled for this.

23:52.383 --> 23:54.352
No.

23:54.384 --> 23:56.220
- Oh my God, you're doin' it.
- Okay.

23:56.252 --> 23:58.155
Chill.

23:58.189 --> 24:00.158
The only person who ever comes
back here is the janitor.

24:00.191 --> 24:02.160
Okay, and so what if he comes
back here and finds us?

24:02.192 --> 24:03.694
Who do you think I got it from?

24:04.894 --> 24:05.730
Oh, you're crazy.

24:05.762 --> 24:07.097
Okay, look, no, no.

24:07.131 --> 24:08.932
I know you've had a really
shitty day,

24:08.965 --> 24:10.734
first day back, it sucked.

24:10.768 --> 24:11.803
I can tell.

24:11.836 --> 24:13.037
Let me like help.

24:13.069 --> 24:14.105
No, I'm okay.

24:14.137 --> 24:15.839
Come on, it'll make you feel
better.

24:16.773 --> 24:18.075
It really will.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.043
Okay.

24:20.044 --> 24:21.079
Okay.

24:21.112 --> 24:22.346
It'll help.

24:26.017 --> 24:27.184
- Just one.
- It smells like a skunk.

24:27.218 --> 24:28.252
Just one.

24:28.285 --> 24:29.187
Here you go.

24:34.392 --> 24:37.228
We can fill the etched
glasses with caramel popcorn.

24:37.260 --> 24:39.062
It'll make a great souvenir.

24:39.096 --> 24:41.132
We project additional revenue of

24:47.104 --> 24:49.973
We project additional revenue

24:50.007 --> 24:52.677
of $400.

24:52.710 --> 24:55.413
Dressing in '20s costume
at the ticket sales table,

24:55.445 --> 24:58.015
we will attract even more people
and sell more tickets.

24:58.048 --> 25:00.918
Now, if we all work super hard

25:05.155 --> 25:07.258
Eva, is everything okay?

25:08.224 --> 25:10.193
Yes, I'm sorry.

25:10.227 --> 25:11.830
I have the bad hiccups.

25:13.931 --> 25:15.199
Keeps goin', Ben.

25:15.231 --> 25:17.701
As I was saying,

25:17.734 --> 25:20.337
if we all work super hard,

25:20.371 --> 25:22.105
then this dance will be one
of the greatest

25:22.138 --> 25:23.340
this school has ever seen.

25:24.842 --> 25:26.044
Thank you, Mr. Hallster.

25:26.076 --> 25:28.913
That was a fantastic
presentation.

25:28.945 --> 25:29.880
Yes.

25:30.815 --> 25:32.150
Great job.

25:32.182 --> 25:34.184
That was the last of our
presentations,

25:34.218 --> 25:36.654
which means it's time to vote.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.695
Alright, the votes are tallied.

25:45.430 --> 25:48.199
The theme for this year's junior
prom is

25:50.934 --> 25:52.336
Hawaiian Aloha!

25:57.974 --> 25:59.476
Beautiful palm tree beaches.

25:59.509 --> 26:00.944
Enchanting.

26:00.978 --> 26:03.413
Her presentation was not better
than ours.

26:03.446 --> 26:05.916
People only voted for her
because her best friend died.

26:06.983 --> 26:08.752
Exactly.

26:08.786 --> 26:11.355
But the fact is that she could
ride this wave of sympathy

26:11.387 --> 26:13.957
all the way to the class
presidency.

26:13.990 --> 26:16.827
Please, people also have short
memories.

26:16.861 --> 26:19.497
They will forget about her best
friend dying in a day or two.

26:19.529 --> 26:21.965
You'll be fine, I promise.

26:24.801 --> 26:25.703
Don't worry!

26:27.137 --> 26:28.038
I love you.

28:15.311 --> 28:16.280
What are you doing?

28:18.414 --> 28:20.451
He looked like he needed a hug,
so

28:20.483 --> 28:21.552
He's not real or anything.

28:28.057 --> 28:30.560
One of my first memories was
with this bear.

28:33.130 --> 28:34.632
It was my first day at
preschool.

28:36.599 --> 28:39.302
And there were so
many kids hitting each other

28:39.336 --> 28:41.172
and putting things in each
other's noses.

28:42.472 --> 28:44.041
I was so scared.

28:46.542 --> 28:49.446
And then all of a sudden,
I hear a voice asking me

28:49.480 --> 28:50.882
if I wanted to play.

28:53.416 --> 28:55.919
And I look up and there your
sister was holding this bear.

28:57.121 --> 28:59.290
Is that how you guys became
friends?

29:02.026 --> 29:03.894
I miss her.

29:03.928 --> 29:04.929
Theo!

29:04.961 --> 29:06.663
We have to get to practice.

29:06.696 --> 29:09.266
- Eva?
- I'm sorry, the door was open.

29:09.299 --> 29:10.967
It's okay.

29:12.670 --> 29:15.439
I haven't been able to come in
here myself

29:15.471 --> 29:17.307
until now.

29:19.643 --> 29:20.912
Is that Poobah?

29:25.348 --> 29:26.917
You should keep him.

29:28.251 --> 29:29.453
She would've wanted you to.

29:33.123 --> 29:34.025
I'm sorry.

30:08.459 --> 30:10.260
You are not makin' this any
easier.

No.

No, now, if we're gonna be
friends,

there can't be any secrets
that's like the rule.

33:14.744 --> 33:15.912
Okay, that's fine.

the day

37:57.059 --> 37:59.695
that Eva Jeffries crashes
a rock concert.

37:59.728 --> 38:01.898
I mean how did Taylor possibly
convince you to do this?

38:03.032 --> 38:04.000
It wasn't her idea.

38:04.034 --> 38:06.836
This was your idea?

38:06.869 --> 38:08.638
Technically, Liz's.

38:16.246 --> 38:18.916
Remember,
when we were little kids,

38:18.949 --> 38:21.518
Liz and I would dress up as
those bad girls named

38:21.550 --> 38:24.654
"Vicky" and "Veronica".

38:24.688 --> 38:27.023
Well, we made up a list of
things that we would never do,

38:27.056 --> 38:29.459
but Vicky and Veronica would,
and we called it

38:29.492 --> 38:31.094
the "never list".

38:31.126 --> 38:34.030
Okay, so this is like a bucket
list never list.

38:35.498 --> 38:37.701
Being a rock star was one of the
items on the list

38:37.733 --> 38:40.203
and I had the chance to do it
tonight, but

38:40.237 --> 38:41.672
- Oh.
- What?

38:41.704 --> 38:42.773
I am a loser.

38:42.806 --> 38:44.173
Oh, you crowd-surfed.

38:44.206 --> 38:45.174
You did it.

38:45.208 --> 38:46.976
I mean there's nothin' more rock
star than that.

38:47.010 --> 38:49.646
But I guess if you like being
groped by 100 drunk dudes.

38:49.679 --> 38:51.048
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty bad.

38:51.081 --> 38:52.016
Okay.

38:54.217 --> 38:56.787
Anyway, it doesn't count

38:56.820 --> 38:59.856
unless I sing publicly,

38:59.889 --> 39:01.657
which will never happen,
because every time

39:01.690 --> 39:03.059
I get on stage I freeze.

39:03.092 --> 39:05.261
So yeah, I'm a loser.

39:05.295 --> 39:07.130
Oh, you're definitely
not a loser.

he's a loser.

42:05.208 --> 42:07.778

be irregular,

42:07.811 --> 42:10.213
change or watch YouTube videos?

42:10.246 --> 42:11.782
There's nothing normal about
laying in bed

42:11.815 --> 42:14.784

all day.

42:14.818 --> 42:17.054

42:21.990 --> 42:23.893
I said I was tired.

42:23.927 --> 42:26.296
I want to be on my tip-top
when I make posters.

42:26.329 --> 42:28.031
What's going on with you?

42:28.063 --> 42:29.132
You're not acting like
yourself.

42:29.164 --> 42:30.000
Where are you going?

42:30.032 --> 42:31.835
I'm going pee.

42:31.867 --> 42:33.804
Do you want to come make sure
I'm doing that right, too?

42:42.112 --> 42:43.146
Eva.

42:44.947 --> 42:46.048
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:46.081 --> 42:49.051
I owe you big time,

42:49.085 --> 42:50.853
so what's next on the list?

42:50.887 --> 42:53.056
Well,
I didn't do the last one.

42:53.088 --> 42:54.490
Saturday night
was an epic fail.

42:54.523 --> 42:55.424
What?

42:55.458 --> 42:57.827
So who cares?

42:57.860 --> 42:59.862
It's not like it's a test
or anything.

43:02.364 --> 43:03.299
Hmm.

43:39.568 --> 43:42.538

43:42.572 --> 43:44.340

43:44.373 --> 43:46.809
Do you ever get in trouble
for sneaking out of school?

43:46.842 --> 43:48.077
Sometimes.

43:48.110 --> 43:50.379
But they just give you
detention, so really no big.

43:50.413 --> 43:52.516
I have never been to detention.

43:52.548 --> 43:53.916
It's so boring.

43:53.949 --> 43:55.951
Literally, all you do is just
study and shit.

43:55.985 --> 43:57.153
Actually, but I love it.

43:58.054 --> 43:58.822

44:12.869 --> 44:14.336
Do you remember that report you
did last year in bio

44:14.369 --> 44:16.839
on fish sex?

44:19.309 --> 44:20.911
Do you mean my presentation

44:20.943 --> 44:22.545
on the reproductive cycle of
salmon?

44:22.579 --> 44:23.547
Yeah.

44:23.579 --> 44:24.914
Yeah, that's the one.

44:24.947 --> 44:26.248
Oh, I can't believe you still
remember that.

44:26.282 --> 44:27.484
Are you kidding?

44:27.516 --> 44:29.219
I mean there are the detailed
drawing of fish

44:29.251 --> 44:30.320
- Oh God.
- Chasing all over the place.

44:33.088 --> 44:34.224
- Uh.
- What?

44:34.257 --> 44:36.492
No, it was actually
it was awesome.

44:36.525 --> 44:38.894
You're a really talented artist,
seriously.

44:38.927 --> 44:40.096
Thanks.

44:40.128 --> 44:41.097
You're welcome.

44:44.500 --> 44:47.103
I've been wanting to ask you
something.

44:47.135 --> 44:48.605
Yeah, what's that?

44:48.637 --> 44:51.440
But you have to promise not to
get mad.

44:51.474 --> 44:53.109
Okay.

44:53.141 --> 44:54.376
What?

44:55.311 --> 44:56.479
Did you really sell drugs?

45:01.416 --> 45:03.252
Why do you wanna know?

45:03.286 --> 45:04.588
Just curious?

45:04.621 --> 45:07.523
There were so many rumors,

45:07.556 --> 45:08.491
you know?

45:10.326 --> 45:12.494
No, I never sold drugs.

45:12.527 --> 45:15.164
Oh.

45:15.197 --> 45:16.966
Uh, you seem oddly disappointed.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.068
- No.
- Yeah?

45:18.101 --> 45:19.068
- No.
- Okay.

45:19.101 --> 45:21.070
- No.
- Uh-huh.

45:21.103 --> 45:22.939
Why'd you have to go
to juvie then?

45:26.108 --> 45:27.376
For being a stupid kid.

45:30.646 --> 45:32.014
When I was a freshman

45:34.317 --> 45:36.253
There's a senior that kind of
took me to under his wing,

45:36.286 --> 45:38.889
and he let me hang out with all
his friends,

45:38.922 --> 45:39.990
and it was cool.

45:40.023 --> 45:41.157
They treated me like
a kid brother.

45:41.190 --> 45:43.559
I never had anything like
that before.

45:43.592 --> 45:46.596
And then one day, he gives me
this bag of oxy pills

45:46.628 --> 45:49.531
to hold on to and so like a dumb
ass I put them in my locker,

45:49.565 --> 45:52.168
thinkin' no one's gonna
look there.

45:52.201 --> 45:53.903
And he must have known that
they were doin'

45:53.936 --> 45:56.272
a drug search that day.

45:56.306 --> 45:58.508
- Dang.
- Yeah.

45:58.541 --> 45:59.910
It's my fault for tryin'
to impress

45:59.943 --> 46:02.112
a bunch of asshole losers,
so you know?

46:06.081 --> 46:08.484
That's why I always
talk about you.

46:08.518 --> 46:11.353
You never tried to be someone
else to impress anyone

46:11.387 --> 46:13.456
like you just

46:13.489 --> 46:14.990
Now, you are who you are

46:15.023 --> 46:16.960
and it's awesome.

46:16.992 --> 46:17.994
Seriously.

46:36.079 --> 46:36.947
Hmm.

46:36.980 --> 46:37.947
What's up?

46:42.452 --> 46:45.388
Is it because of Liz?

46:45.420 --> 46:48.524
Yeah, yeah.

46:48.557 --> 46:51.327
You know, I was never in to her
like that, though, right?

46:52.728 --> 46:54.431
I know.

46:54.463 --> 46:56.699
It's still strange.

46:58.768 --> 47:00.070
I get it.

47:00.103 --> 47:01.704
I do.

47:04.673 --> 47:07.009
Um, well, maybe we could
just hang out

47:07.043 --> 47:08.445
and see where it goes.

47:08.478 --> 47:09.713
- Okay.
- Okay.

47:09.746 --> 47:11.247
- Yeah.
- Okay.

47:11.280 --> 47:13.249
Alright, cool.

47:13.282 --> 47:14.184
You haven't even done your
burger.

47:14.217 --> 47:15.617
- Oh.
- Yeah.

47:15.650 --> 47:18.087
- So aren't you eat
- Won't eat that one anymore.

47:18.121 --> 47:19.056
Yeah.

47:23.760 --> 47:24.728
Eva.

47:26.661 --> 47:28.530
Yeah?

47:28.563 --> 47:31.500
You were supposed to sell
tickets at lunch today.

47:31.534 --> 47:32.702
They said you weren't there.

47:32.735 --> 47:34.304
Oh, I'm sorry.

47:34.336 --> 47:36.373
I guess I forgot.

47:36.405 --> 47:38.407
We have to be selling
tickets every lunch period.

47:38.440 --> 47:41.377
Uh, I can't tell you how
important that is.

47:41.411 --> 47:44.079
Look, if you can't make
your obligation,

47:44.112 --> 47:46.515
then let me know and I'll have
someone replace you, okay?

47:47.682 --> 47:50.186
Can you make tomorrow?

47:50.219 --> 47:52.355
Yeah.

47:52.387 --> 47:53.590
Okay.

47:57.260 --> 47:59.229
I'm concerned about you, Eva.

47:59.262 --> 48:01.698
A lot of your teachers are.

48:01.731 --> 48:04.434
We know your friend's
passing was really hard on you.

48:08.838 --> 48:11.673
Maybe you should reconsider
running for class president.

48:11.706 --> 48:14.411
I mean Ben will do a great job.

48:14.443 --> 48:17.313
Are you firing me from student
government?

48:17.346 --> 48:19.449
No, it's just

48:21.851 --> 48:24.054
Well, elections are three
weeks away

48:24.086 --> 48:26.722
and I haven't seen a single
poster.

48:26.755 --> 48:29.525
Okay.

48:29.559 --> 48:32.362
I will make posters tonight and
have them up by tomorrow.

48:32.394 --> 48:34.163
Good.

48:34.197 --> 48:35.198
That's what I like to hear.

48:39.735 --> 48:41.336
Shall we button out striking the
character?

48:41.369 --> 48:42.404
Oh yeah, it looks good.

48:42.438 --> 48:43.273
Yeah.

48:43.306 --> 48:44.441
Thank you for supporting me.

48:44.474 --> 48:46.543
Absolutely.

48:46.576 --> 48:48.344
Ow, I nearly just poked myself.

48:50.246 --> 48:52.648
What's all this?

48:52.681 --> 48:54.783
We're making campaign posters.

48:54.817 --> 48:56.318
Yeah, she's the artist,

48:56.351 --> 48:57.786
I'm just uh, tryin' to stay
in the lines.

49:01.590 --> 49:02.692
We have a lot to make.

49:02.724 --> 49:05.427
I mean feel free to hop in.

49:05.460 --> 49:07.596
No, um, I gotta start dinner.

49:07.630 --> 49:09.566
Is Joey joining us for dinner?

49:09.599 --> 49:11.101
Uh, sure.

49:11.134 --> 49:11.802
Thanks.

49:25.748 --> 49:26.749
Do you want some mashed potato?

49:26.782 --> 49:28.651
Yeah.

49:28.684 --> 49:30.820
Yeah, so you've ben fixin' up
your dad's Chevelle.

49:30.853 --> 49:33.690
Yeah, I actually just replaced
the drums, add a new fuel gauge.

49:33.722 --> 49:36.358
I always loved that car.

49:36.391 --> 49:38.094
Hey, your dad would be really
proud of you for fixin' it up.

49:41.731 --> 49:42.866
How's your mom?

49:42.898 --> 49:44.400
We haven't seen her around
lately.

49:44.432 --> 49:47.302
Oh, she's uh, between
her new boyfriend

49:47.335 --> 49:48.637
and work travels.

49:48.670 --> 49:50.439
I haven't really seen her
either actually,

49:50.472 --> 49:52.442
but she's good.

49:55.311 --> 49:57.581
Eva, did you get that band for
the dance?

49:58.681 --> 50:00.550
Band?

50:00.583 --> 50:03.418
Yeah, the one you and Taylor
went to see the other night?

50:03.452 --> 50:04.721
Blank Slate?

50:04.753 --> 50:06.155
You're getting them to play
at the dance?

50:06.188 --> 50:08.891
Oh, yeah, no, they were too
expensive.

50:08.925 --> 50:09.859
Oh, it's too bad.

50:09.891 --> 50:11.193
Oh, they're amazing.

50:11.226 --> 50:12.795
It was such a fun night.

50:12.827 --> 50:13.563
It was awesome.

50:13.596 --> 50:14.530
Hmm.

50:26.775 --> 50:28.544
Are we really not gonna talk
about the fact that

50:28.577 --> 50:31.181
our daughter is making googly
eyes at a drug pusher?

50:31.213 --> 50:32.916
Hey, I thought Lucille
said he was set up.

50:32.949 --> 50:34.784
Oh, of course, she'll say that.

50:34.817 --> 50:36.418
Wouldn't you if your kid was
arrested in the middle

50:36.452 --> 50:37.620
of school?

50:37.652 --> 50:38.954
Yeah, well, this isn't just
any kid, alright?

50:38.987 --> 50:40.789
We've known Joey
since he was a toddler.

50:40.822 --> 50:43.225
Maybe still,
but he is a grown kid now.

50:43.259 --> 50:45.360
A grown kid with a hot rod

50:45.393 --> 50:46.929
and no parental supervision.

50:49.864 --> 50:51.700
You know, who you sound like,
don't you?

50:51.733 --> 50:54.703
Don't even I am nothing
like my mother.

50:54.737 --> 50:56.773
If I were, Joey would have not
made it through

50:56.806 --> 50:57.907
the front door.

50:57.940 --> 51:00.842
Uh, that's true.

51:00.876 --> 51:02.644
Look, Joey's had some rough
patches in life,

51:02.677 --> 51:04.513
but he's a good kid.

51:04.547 --> 51:05.847
And Eva's

51:05.880 --> 51:07.583
Eva, look she makes
straight As, okay?

51:07.617 --> 51:09.219
She's running for student
council president

51:09.251 --> 51:10.887
and she's organizing
her junior prom.

51:10.920 --> 51:12.889
What more do you expect
from her?

51:12.922 --> 51:14.824
Respect.

51:14.856 --> 51:16.358
She talked back at me
the other day.

51:17.726 --> 51:19.596
Oh my God, she talked
back at you.

51:19.628 --> 51:21.697
What kind of a teenager
does that?

51:21.731 --> 51:23.266
Don't mock me, okay?

51:23.298 --> 51:25.400
You can be cool dad for as long
as you want,

51:25.434 --> 51:26.736
but I'm gonna do what's right
for my daughter,

51:26.768 --> 51:28.971
even if that means being
the uh,

51:29.005 --> 51:30.573
bad cop parent or whatever,

51:30.606 --> 51:32.375
because her future is too
important.

51:32.407 --> 51:33.409
Okay.

51:33.442 --> 51:34.811
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

51:36.846 --> 51:38.847
Okay, I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have mocked you like that.

51:40.016 --> 51:41.550
And you're right.

51:41.583 --> 51:43.286
I'm gonna have to set down some
ground rules

51:43.318 --> 51:46.021
if she's gonna start dating.

51:46.054 --> 51:48.357
Hey, this is new territory for
both of us, alright?

51:48.391 --> 51:50.927
And I'm just trying to do the
right thing.

51:50.960 --> 51:52.429
For our daughter.

51:56.065 --> 51:56.898
Okay?

51:56.931 --> 51:57.866
Yes.

51:57.900 --> 51:59.335
Let's go.

52:03.505 --> 52:04.873
Fed's raising rates again.

52:07.742 --> 52:08.777
I've gotta run.

52:08.811 --> 52:10.413
Uh, just a second, we need to
talk.

52:10.445 --> 52:11.346
What?

52:11.380 --> 52:12.749
Joey is waiting for me outside.

52:12.782 --> 52:14.550
Yeah, that's what you need to
talk to you about.

52:14.583 --> 52:17.452
Um, from now on, unless we're
here, Joey can't be here.

52:17.485 --> 52:18.754
You guys don't trust me now?

52:18.788 --> 52:19.856
Sweetie, of course, we do.

52:19.889 --> 52:22.291
We just need to lay down a few
ground rules, you know?

52:22.324 --> 52:23.925
No going over to boys houses
if their parents aren't there

52:23.958 --> 52:25.794
and no having boys over here
if we're not.

52:25.827 --> 52:26.862
You know, basic stuff.

52:26.896 --> 52:28.564
That's it?

52:28.597 --> 52:30.900
Actually, no,
but since you running late,

52:30.932 --> 52:32.568
we'll discuss the rest
of it tonight.

52:32.601 --> 52:33.403
Great.

52:33.436 --> 52:35.305
Bye.

52:36.371 --> 52:37.640
Have a good day.

52:40.041 --> 52:41.310
I thought that went well.

52:45.481 --> 52:46.549
Who are you gonna vote for?

52:46.581 --> 52:47.683
Eva Jeffries.

52:47.717 --> 52:48.418
That's right.

52:49.518 --> 52:50.420
Have a good one.

52:50.452 --> 52:51.387
Thanks.

52:52.954 --> 52:54.723
Oh hi, pin.

52:56.391 --> 52:57.960
Vote for Eva Jeffries.

52:59.628 --> 53:00.730
Bye.

53:00.762 --> 53:01.630
Enjoy.

53:01.664 --> 53:02.598
Worked well.

53:02.630 --> 53:04.634
Hey.

53:04.666 --> 53:05.668
Hey.

53:05.701 --> 53:06.903
Great job on the posters.

53:06.936 --> 53:08.571
Thanks.

53:08.603 --> 53:10.406
It's good to have the old Eva
back.

53:29.791 --> 53:31.094
Uh, two tickets, please.

53:31.126 --> 53:32.661
I am so glad you're here.

53:32.695 --> 53:34.130
I was very bored.

53:36.831 --> 53:38.768
Two tickets, please.

53:38.800 --> 53:39.835
Oh.

53:39.869 --> 53:40.503
Yes, sir.

53:41.570 --> 53:43.072
$40.

53:43.105 --> 53:44.773
Cool, thank you.

53:44.806 --> 53:45.708
Later.

53:51.679 --> 53:53.048
Uh, Eva?

53:53.081 --> 53:55.484
Yeah?

53:55.518 --> 53:56.853
Would you wanna go to the dance
with me?

53:58.853 --> 54:00.389
Yes.

54:05.494 --> 54:06.663
Wooh!

54:25.447 --> 54:27.650
Are you sure she's not some
21 Jump Street

54:27.682 --> 54:28.985
undercover narc situation?

54:29.018 --> 54:30.887
Oh, Burt, don't be a dildo.

54:30.920 --> 54:31.854
Don't be so paranoid either.

54:31.887 --> 54:33.589
Are you high right now?

54:33.621 --> 54:34.523
- It's fine.
- Yeah.

54:34.556 --> 54:35.957
Oh, well, okay.

54:35.990 --> 54:37.492
Well, yeah, we're just gonna
make some pot brownies.

54:37.525 --> 54:39.094
Can you get us the ingredient
or not?

54:39.128 --> 54:40.596
Yeah, I can get it.

54:40.628 --> 54:41.764
Perfect.

54:41.797 --> 54:43.599
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

54:43.632 --> 54:44.567
Thanks.

54:45.701 --> 54:46.936
There was a guy Macbeth,
right?

54:46.969 --> 54:48.037
Yep.

54:48.070 --> 54:50.440
- And he is a general.
- Mmhmm.

54:50.472 --> 54:52.175
- Or something.
- Mmhmm.

54:52.208 --> 54:54.644
And these witch ladies
tell him

54:54.677 --> 54:56.512
that he's gonna be
the next king.

54:56.545 --> 54:59.615
Well, he gets all power trippy,

54:59.648 --> 55:02.552
and he actually goes,
and he kills the current king,

55:02.585 --> 55:03.885
and he starts having these
dreams,

55:03.918 --> 55:05.520
and like visions and shit,

55:05.554 --> 55:06.756
and they make him
even crazier.

55:06.789 --> 55:07.790
Yeah.

55:07.822 --> 55:08.857
Let me cut to the end.

55:08.891 --> 55:09.925
Then he gets his head
chopped off.

55:09.958 --> 55:11.193
Yeah, because his wife's
an idiot

55:11.226 --> 55:12.594
and she talks in her sleep.

55:12.628 --> 55:13.629
No, yeah, sounds about right.

55:13.661 --> 55:14.797
I'm gonna make an A tomorrow.

55:14.829 --> 55:15.630
Yeah, you're gonna do great.

55:18.132 --> 55:20.669
Okay, so let's go over
our plan.

55:20.702 --> 55:21.670
Okay.

55:21.704 --> 55:22.772
It's very simple.

55:22.804 --> 55:25.640
The regular brownies

55:25.673 --> 55:26.576
and the pot brownies.

55:26.608 --> 55:28.177
Yep.

55:28.210 --> 55:29.612
And the regular brownies are
gonna go for the bake sale

55:29.644 --> 55:31.514
and the special brownies
are gonna go

55:31.547 --> 55:33.782
in this happy bag!

55:33.815 --> 55:34.783
'Cause they're so happy.

55:34.817 --> 55:35.617
Very clever.

55:35.650 --> 55:37.085
- Right.
- Clever.

55:37.119 --> 55:38.187
And then the regular ones go
in the regular bake

55:38.219 --> 55:39.888
for the bake sale.

55:39.922 --> 55:41.190
And then you'll meet Dev first
thing tomorrow morning

55:41.222 --> 55:43.525
at the usual spot and give him
the brownies

55:43.559 --> 55:44.527
to get to the money.

55:44.559 --> 55:46.094
- Yep.
- That's it.

55:46.128 --> 55:48.798
And how much do I charge Dev?

55:48.831 --> 55:51.701
Um, for him like 100.

55:53.969 --> 55:56.873
Wait, so if I made five batches,

55:56.905 --> 55:58.541
I can make $500?

55:58.574 --> 56:00.976
Yeah, 'cause that's smile.

56:01.010 --> 56:01.944
- Why?
- Okay.

56:01.976 --> 56:03.045
Why?

56:03.077 --> 56:04.146
- Do you need do you need money?
- Well

56:04.179 --> 56:04.981
Oh.

56:05.014 --> 56:06.615
Taylor.

56:06.648 --> 56:08.116
I swear.

56:08.150 --> 56:09.552
You were the one
to start it, girl.

56:09.585 --> 56:10.186
Oh no.

56:12.086 --> 56:12.788
No.

56:14.322 --> 56:15.757
Don't.

56:15.791 --> 56:16.225
Taylor!

56:18.927 --> 56:19.728
Okay!

56:21.563 --> 56:22.230
Oh my God.

56:22.264 --> 56:23.199
- I blew it.
- Shit, shit.

56:23.231 --> 56:24.266
You gotta go.

56:24.300 --> 56:25.234
- You gotta go.
- Shit, shit.

56:25.266 --> 56:26.201
Okay, okay, okay.

56:26.235 --> 56:27.068
Get the pot brownies
and go.

56:27.101 --> 56:29.004
- Um.
- Fuck, go!

56:29.038 --> 56:30.240
Okay, okay, okay,
okay.

56:38.313 --> 56:39.681
What the

56:39.715 --> 56:40.615
What's goin' on in here?

56:40.650 --> 56:43.686
I was making some brownies for
the bake sale

56:43.719 --> 56:45.621
and I just burned a couple
of them.

56:45.653 --> 56:47.322
Why didn't you wait for me?

56:47.356 --> 56:49.025
'Cause you were at the school
board meeting,

56:49.057 --> 56:51.092
and Taylor came over
and helped me.

56:52.860 --> 56:55.697
Just make sure that you clean
all of this stuff up.

56:55.731 --> 56:57.133
Okay.

57:01.202 --> 57:03.739
Would it kill you to include
your mom once in a while?

57:03.771 --> 57:05.173
I'm sorry.

57:05.206 --> 57:07.710
Now, keep the windows and doors
open to vent this smell.

57:08.811 --> 57:09.579
Okay.

57:15.284 --> 57:17.720
They're still here.

57:28.262 --> 57:29.231
Yep.

57:34.802 --> 57:35.938
Thank you.

57:45.079 --> 57:47.215
Okay, we're ready.

57:47.248 --> 57:49.250
Oh, uh, principals first.

57:50.184 --> 57:51.820
Oh, brownies.

57:51.853 --> 57:52.855
How many would you like?

57:52.887 --> 57:53.722
Oh, you know what?

57:53.755 --> 57:55.190
I'm gonna take all of them.

57:55.224 --> 57:57.727
It'll be a nice treat for all
the teachers.

57:57.760 --> 57:59.295
Do you have any smaller bills
than that?

57:59.327 --> 58:01.697
Keep the change, it's for a good
cause.

58:01.730 --> 58:03.331
How generous of you?

58:03.364 --> 58:04.165
Oh, thanks.

58:04.199 --> 58:05.101
Enjoy.

58:05.134 --> 58:06.101
Cheers.

58:06.135 --> 58:07.870
Hey, what can I get you?

58:24.786 --> 58:25.221
Here you go.

58:25.253 --> 58:27.088
Thanks.

58:27.121 --> 58:27.889
Should we start cleaning?

58:27.922 --> 58:28.824
Yeah.

58:32.161 --> 58:33.996
Hey, I don't know what you did,
but Dev is looking for you.

58:34.028 --> 58:36.731
He's super pissed.

58:40.768 --> 58:41.971
Taylor.

59:14.436 --> 59:17.039
You guys, government is
watching.

59:17.072 --> 59:18.074
They are watching everything.

59:18.106 --> 59:19.974
The government,
they are watching us

59:20.007 --> 59:21.843
all the time
and they're listen

59:34.956 --> 59:37.926
They are listening

59:37.960 --> 59:38.994
all the time.

59:47.469 --> 59:48.804
"Was the hope drunk

59:48.836 --> 59:51.172
Wherein you dressed yourself?

59:51.206 --> 59:52.775
Hath it slept since?

59:52.807 --> 59:55.010
And wakes it now, to look so
green and pale.

59:55.043 --> 59:56.445
At what it did so freely?

59:56.478 --> 59:57.346
From this time

59:57.378 --> 01:00:00.348
Such I account thy love."

01:00:00.382 --> 01:00:02.284
Isn't that beautiful?

01:00:03.284 --> 01:00:04.452
It's wonderful.

01:00:04.485 --> 01:00:06.489
Isn't it wonderful?

01:00:06.521 --> 01:00:09.491
She's one of the most
strongest

01:00:09.525 --> 01:00:12.360
characters in all of
Shakespeare.

01:00:13.896 --> 01:00:15.297
Oh!

01:00:15.329 --> 01:00:17.398
Give me your phone, give me
your phones.

01:00:17.431 --> 01:00:19.067
The government knows what your
face looks like.

01:00:19.101 --> 01:00:20.302
They know how everything
looks.

01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:31.413
Put on your safety goggles,
everybody.

01:00:31.445 --> 01:00:32.380
Ooh.

01:00:34.148 --> 01:00:36.318
Get ready for some chemistry.

01:00:39.922 --> 01:00:40.556
Oh crap!

01:00:40.588 --> 01:00:41.422
Get out!

01:00:41.456 --> 01:00:43.459
Get out, get out!

01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:05.847
Hi, I'm so sorry I didn't really
did not mean to do anything.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.016
Can I give you a hug?

01:01:07.048 --> 01:01:07.949
Please, I'm so sorry.

01:01:07.983 --> 01:01:09.385
Okay.

01:01:09.418 --> 01:01:11.086
Oh, dang it.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.230
Hey.

01:01:21.262 --> 01:01:22.331
Hi.

01:01:22.364 --> 01:01:25.233
So my mom is in Denver
for the week

01:01:25.266 --> 01:01:28.002
and I wanted to see if you
wanted to maybe

01:01:28.036 --> 01:01:30.072
hang out with me.

01:01:30.105 --> 01:01:32.106
My parents

01:01:32.139 --> 01:01:34.275
Would not let me go whenever
your mom is not in town.

01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:35.277
But

01:01:35.309 --> 01:01:37.980
But sneaking out, it's gonna be
out of the list.

01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:41.250
You are so busted.

01:01:41.282 --> 01:01:43.117
You sold pot brownies to the
teachers.

01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:44.118
That's bullshit. I didn't do
anything.

01:01:44.152 --> 01:01:46.487
Not you, her.

01:01:46.521 --> 01:01:49.425
Although, you probably helped
her out, drug boy.

01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:51.193
What are they talking about?

01:01:51.226 --> 01:01:52.228
Don't look at me.

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:53.561
No.

01:01:53.594 --> 01:01:54.996
Not this time.

01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:57.132
Your Little Miss Innocent act
isn't gonna work.

01:01:57.164 --> 01:01:58.967
My cousin Dev told me
everything.

01:01:59.001 --> 01:02:00.135
He's lying.

01:02:00.168 --> 01:02:02.304
Well, we'll just have to see
what Mr. Snyder

01:02:02.336 --> 01:02:03.972
says about this.

01:02:04.005 --> 01:02:06.541
Won't we?

01:02:06.574 --> 01:02:08.509
Excuse me, guys,

01:02:08.543 --> 01:02:09.510
- Don't!
- Get your hands

01:02:09.543 --> 01:02:10.545
Hey, Izzi.

01:02:10.579 --> 01:02:12.014
- Off of me!
- Izzy!

01:02:12.047 --> 01:02:13.282
God.

01:02:26.961 --> 01:02:29.164
The last person I would ever
expect to have here

01:02:29.197 --> 01:02:31.432
in my office is you, Eva.

01:02:31.465 --> 01:02:33.101
Fighting in the hallways?

01:02:33.135 --> 01:02:34.937
Why would you resort to this
behavior?

01:02:34.969 --> 01:02:36.605
She is making up
lies about me to help Ben

01:02:36.637 --> 01:02:38.239
with the student council
election.

01:02:38.273 --> 01:02:39.675
She's telling everyone that
I sold pot brownies

01:02:39.708 --> 01:02:41.410
to the teachers.

01:02:41.443 --> 01:02:44.146
What?

01:02:44.179 --> 01:02:46.414
Principal Greer, as president of
the school board

01:02:46.447 --> 01:02:49.183
we cannot tolerate this kind of
bullying on this campus.

01:02:49.217 --> 01:02:51.019
- Uh, we will not allow
- Furthermore.

01:02:51.052 --> 01:02:53.188
Furthermore,
I am deeply concerned

01:02:53.221 --> 01:02:55.925
about my daughter's emotional
well-being.

01:02:55.958 --> 01:02:57.960
She recently lost her best
friend.

01:02:57.992 --> 01:03:00.061
Yes, I'm aware.

01:03:00.094 --> 01:03:02.230
Can you imagine
what a smear campaign

01:03:02.264 --> 01:03:03.632
like this might do to her?

01:03:03.664 --> 01:03:06.601
I will make sure that any
student spreading false rumors

01:03:06.635 --> 01:03:09.472
on campus or online face severe
consequences.

01:03:10.739 --> 01:03:12.407
But that doesn't excuse you
starting fights,

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.243
young lady, you understand?

01:03:15.277 --> 01:03:17.512
Yes. It won't happen again.

01:03:17.545 --> 01:03:20.515
Given your exemplary record and
your clear remorse,

01:03:20.548 --> 01:03:22.951
I'm assigning you to 20 hours of
after-school tutoring.

01:03:24.152 --> 01:03:25.487
I don't need tutoring.

01:03:25.519 --> 01:03:28.123
No, but others might.

01:03:28.155 --> 01:03:30.259
You know, helping those
less-academically-gifted

01:03:30.291 --> 01:03:32.327
might help you get your own
grades up.

01:03:34.695 --> 01:03:37.199
I messed up on a few exams,
it's no big deal.

01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:38.367
Oh!

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.102
No big deal?

01:03:40.135 --> 01:03:42.538
Your grades this year affect
your college admissions.

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:43.538
You know this!

01:03:43.572 --> 01:03:45.039
I'll make them up.

01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:46.574
Oh, you will, because you're
grounded for two weeks.

01:03:46.608 --> 01:03:49.278
Let's see no phone, no TV,
no computer,

01:03:49.311 --> 01:03:50.412
no going out with friends.

01:03:50.445 --> 01:03:52.181
No life, got it.

01:03:52.213 --> 01:03:53.648
Attitude, young lady.

01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:39.228
♪ Beautiful, beautiful ♪

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:42.096
So I was tryin' to text you
today, you got me worried.

01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:43.398
My parents took my phone.

01:04:45.766 --> 01:04:47.802

just that ♪

01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:50.438
This is so weird.

01:04:50.472 --> 01:04:52.541
Why?

01:04:52.574 --> 01:04:54.777
I remember being like
a little kid,

01:04:54.809 --> 01:04:57.679
and there were Fran scribbles
everywhere and Legos.

01:04:59.114 --> 01:05:01.516
Yeah, well, no more scribbles,
unfortunately,

01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:03.218
but I do have some Legos.

01:05:03.251 --> 01:05:04.686
Couldn't get rid of those.

01:05:04.719 --> 01:05:05.753
You are cute.

01:05:09.257 --> 01:05:12.128
Hey, I needed to ask you.

01:05:13.795 --> 01:05:15.431
Did you do it?

01:05:15.463 --> 01:05:18.567
Did you get the teachers stoned?

01:05:18.599 --> 01:05:21.469
'Cause I just can't be around
people involved with drugs.

01:05:21.503 --> 01:05:23.506
You know, I'm too scared to take
the risk.

01:05:26.875 --> 01:05:29.577
No.

01:05:29.610 --> 01:05:30.711
I promise I had nothing
to do with

01:05:30.744 --> 01:05:33.248
what happened to the teachers.

01:05:34.349 --> 01:05:35.350
Oh my God.

01:05:35.382 --> 01:05:36.217
- Thank you.
- Oh.

01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:38.487
You don't even understand

01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:41.322
How happy that makes me.

01:05:41.356 --> 01:05:42.825
Oh, I was freakin' out
for a little bit.

01:05:43.592 --> 01:05:44.393
So

01:05:46.327 --> 01:05:48.197
Did you um, did you wanna like

01:05:49.864 --> 01:05:52.733
you wanna like watch
a movie or like I have Legos.

01:05:52.766 --> 01:05:54.502
- That I mentioned that.
- Mm.

01:05:54.536 --> 01:05:56.804
I still we could play
some Legos.

01:05:56.838 --> 01:05:57.773
Are you, you're not

01:05:57.806 --> 01:05:59.108
Mm-mm.

01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:00.442
- Not tryin' to do that?
- No, it's good.

01:06:00.474 --> 01:06:01.476
- Well.
- This is good.

01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:02.511
- This better.
- Yeah, this is good.

01:06:02.543 --> 01:06:03.644
- This is good?
- Yeah.

01:06:03.677 --> 01:06:04.712
- Okay, right now.
- Mmhmm.

01:06:04.746 --> 01:06:05.681
- How about this?
- Yeah.

01:06:05.713 --> 01:06:07.148
- Is this good?
- Mmhmm.

01:06:55.262 --> 01:06:56.632
You were at Joey's all night?

01:06:56.664 --> 01:06:58.432
I don't do anything, we just
hung out.

01:06:58.465 --> 01:07:00.835
Yeah, like we're supposed to
believe that?

01:07:00.869 --> 01:07:02.637
Like, you know, I have half
a mind to head over

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:03.905
to his house right now.

01:07:03.938 --> 01:07:04.739
Okay, I will call Lucille in.

01:07:04.773 --> 01:07:05.774
What?

01:07:05.806 --> 01:07:07.275
- Joey didn't do anything.
- Please.

01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.943
Oh yeah.

01:07:07.976 --> 01:07:09.577
Yeah, I'm sure he's a saint.

01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:12.480
Eva, look, we have tried to be
sensitive to everything

01:07:12.514 --> 01:07:14.682
that you have been going through

01:07:14.715 --> 01:07:16.351
in the past several weeks uh,

01:07:16.384 --> 01:07:18.853
you know, but sneaking out,

01:07:18.887 --> 01:07:20.756
and getting into fights
at school,

01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:21.890
and ignoring your studies.

01:07:21.922 --> 01:07:23.457
I mean, what is going on
with you?

01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:25.561
You are not acting like
yourself.

01:07:25.594 --> 01:07:28.329
You mean I'm not being your
perfect model student anymore.

01:07:29.998 --> 01:07:31.666
You know what?

01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:34.335
I am done focusing on grades,
class presentation,

01:07:34.369 --> 01:07:35.403
and fucking student council
election.

01:07:35.436 --> 01:07:36.304
Young lady!

01:07:36.338 --> 01:07:36.972
Oh my God!

01:07:37.005 --> 01:07:38.440
What?

01:07:38.472 --> 01:07:40.608
Well, you're just gonna throw
your future away?

01:07:41.943 --> 01:07:43.812
I'm tired.

01:07:43.844 --> 01:07:46.747
Can I go to bed now?

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:49.684
Go and stay there.

01:07:49.717 --> 01:07:51.385
Bullshit

01:07:51.418 --> 01:07:52.587
What was that?

01:07:52.621 --> 01:07:54.856
I said I wish it had been me
instead of Liz.

01:08:00.695 --> 01:08:01.763
Oh my God.

01:08:03.431 --> 01:08:04.833
We're losing her, Paul.

01:08:10.972 --> 01:08:13.875
Things will blow over,
okay?

01:08:13.907 --> 01:08:15.743
Wanna bet?

01:08:15.777 --> 01:08:17.845
I overheard them talking about
how they want to send me

01:08:17.877 --> 01:08:20.648
to Hawaii to spend the summer
with my grandparents.

01:08:21.716 --> 01:08:22.818
Shit.

01:08:24.853 --> 01:08:27.020
Hey, lovebirds.

01:08:27.055 --> 01:08:28.724
What?

01:08:28.756 --> 01:08:29.991
Nothin'.

01:08:30.024 --> 01:08:31.425
I'll see you two in class.

01:08:31.457 --> 01:08:32.228
Okay.

01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:38.265
What?

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.533
My parents caught me sneaking
out to Joey last night.

01:08:40.568 --> 01:08:43.305
So now I'm grounded for the rest
of my life.

01:08:43.337 --> 01:08:46.375
Oh my God, that sucks.

01:08:46.408 --> 01:08:48.577
You spent the whole night
with Joey

01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:50.679
and did you do the deed?

01:08:50.712 --> 01:08:52.447
No, I didn't do the deed.

01:08:53.581 --> 01:08:55.317
But some lesser deeds.

01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:58.319
I'm so proud of my girl.

01:08:58.353 --> 01:08:58.752
Big mommy.

01:08:58.787 --> 01:08:59.520
- Oh.
- Mommy.

01:08:59.554 --> 01:09:00.689
Yeah.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.890
Uh-oh, smug hall alert.

01:09:02.923 --> 01:09:04.725
I'm gonna hit their asses
for you.

01:09:04.759 --> 01:09:06.627
No, I got a better plan.

01:09:08.395 --> 01:09:09.596
Tell me about these deeds.

01:10:24.738 --> 01:10:26.974
Officer
elections are a week away.

01:10:28.777 --> 01:10:31.712
On Monday, each candidate will
have the opportunity

01:10:31.746 --> 01:10:33.849
to speak to their respective
classes

01:10:33.881 --> 01:10:35.116
as to why they feel they should

01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:36.951
be president, vice president,

01:10:36.984 --> 01:10:38.886
secretary, and treasurer.

01:10:45.126 --> 01:10:47.930
I'm sorry your drink fell out
of your backpack.

01:10:49.863 --> 01:10:51.532
Thanks.

01:10:54.836 --> 01:10:57.539
I need your speeches on my desk
no later than Monday.

01:11:00.041 --> 01:11:02.511
Ben is there something
you wanna say?

01:11:08.783 --> 01:11:11.720
Um, I said some things to my
opponent,

01:11:11.752 --> 01:11:14.523
which I'm told hurt her a lot,

01:11:16.224 --> 01:11:18.793
and I didn't mean for things to
go that far,

01:11:19.961 --> 01:11:21.997
and I'm not proud of
what I said.

01:11:22.029 --> 01:11:24.965
So Eva, I hope you will accept

01:11:24.998 --> 01:11:26.867
my apology.

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.671
From here on out, I will be
running a clean campaign.

01:11:33.675 --> 01:11:34.810
Thanks.

01:11:54.061 --> 01:11:56.198
Thank God, it didn't work.

01:12:30.664 --> 01:12:32.533
He's got a boner.

01:13:39.367 --> 01:13:42.103
Did you do this?

01:13:42.136 --> 01:13:44.006
Is this funny to you?

01:13:46.274 --> 01:13:48.310
Fuck!

01:13:50.811 --> 01:13:52.280
Fuck!

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:09.197
Ben, it's okay.

01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:10.197
Come on.

01:14:10.230 --> 01:14:11.632
Come on, Ben.

01:14:19.273 --> 01:14:20.842
Why is everyone acting so weird?

01:14:20.875 --> 01:14:21.876
Oh my God, you just missed it.

01:14:21.908 --> 01:14:23.210
What?

01:14:23.243 --> 01:14:24.878
So that guy Ben that you're
running against,

01:14:24.912 --> 01:14:26.780
he just lost it and started
ripping down

01:14:26.814 --> 01:14:28.149
all his posters.

01:14:28.181 --> 01:14:30.818
It was insane.

01:14:30.851 --> 01:14:32.319
Yeah, people drew on 'em.

01:14:32.353 --> 01:14:33.354
Why would someone do that?

01:14:33.387 --> 01:14:35.957
I don't know I heard that he got
like a big hard on

01:14:35.989 --> 01:14:38.158
during his wrestling match last
night and it was like

he got a boner.

not funny like the brownies.

01:15:01.448 --> 01:15:03.684

accident, too?

01:18:49.676 --> 01:18:51.445
Um, uh, he called me at work.

01:18:51.479 --> 01:18:53.882
Oh yeah, my mom gave me
her cell.

01:18:53.914 --> 01:18:54.882
Her cell.

01:18:54.916 --> 01:18:56.384
Her cell!

01:18:57.685 --> 01:18:59.888
No.

01:19:01.988 --> 01:19:03.591
Phew, okay.

01:19:05.926 --> 01:19:07.461
She took her phone.

01:19:07.494 --> 01:19:09.197
No, I already tried calling her,
she's not answering.

01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:10.130
No, no, no.

01:19:10.163 --> 01:19:11.298
I put tracker on her phone.

01:19:11.332 --> 01:19:12.901
I can use my phone
to find hers.

01:19:12.934 --> 01:19:13.601
You're brilliant,
come on.

01:19:13.634 --> 01:19:15.036
Okay.

01:19:49.036 --> 01:19:49.671
Hey!

01:19:51.171 --> 01:19:52.105
Don't touch me.

01:19:53.373 --> 01:19:54.242
Stop!

01:19:56.077 --> 01:19:57.545
Hey, whoa,
we're just tryin' to be friends.

01:20:32.445 --> 01:20:34.716
Oh my God, Paul,
she's over here.

01:20:37.018 --> 01:20:39.052
Eva.

01:20:39.086 --> 01:20:40.121
- Hey.
- Mom.

01:20:40.154 --> 01:20:42.523
Are you okay?

01:20:42.555 --> 01:20:44.425
- Dad.
- Sweetie.

01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:46.561
Are you hurt?

01:20:47.494 --> 01:20:49.363
- What's wrong?
- What?

01:20:51.097 --> 01:20:52.567
Doesn't look good.

01:20:55.403 --> 01:20:58.338
Look, where is Joey's car?

01:20:58.372 --> 01:21:00.275
It got towed.

01:21:02.243 --> 01:21:03.344
I'll take care of it, okay?

01:21:03.377 --> 01:21:05.213
Just get her home.

01:21:06.546 --> 01:21:08.081
I'm sorry.

01:21:10.717 --> 01:21:12.220
Let's get out of here.

01:21:23.163 --> 01:21:25.500
I can't believe you did that.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:27.568
After Liz?

01:21:29.703 --> 01:21:32.473
What do you think we thought?

01:21:32.506 --> 01:21:34.108
Did you think hadn't we put that
tracker on your phone,

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.543
you could have been hurt.

01:21:36.577 --> 01:21:38.212
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

01:21:38.244 --> 01:21:40.114
You could have been hurt.

01:21:45.552 --> 01:21:46.386
Did something happen?

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:47.121
Did someone try-

01:21:47.154 --> 01:21:49.657
No.

01:21:49.689 --> 01:21:52.226
Geez, I can handle myself
for one night.

01:21:53.327 --> 01:21:54.628
Right, really?

01:21:54.662 --> 01:21:56.497
Okay.

01:21:56.529 --> 01:21:59.367
So sleeping in a dingy alley
is handling it.

01:21:59.399 --> 01:22:01.402
Okay, noted.

01:22:11.444 --> 01:22:13.514
Where are we going?

01:22:13.546 --> 01:22:14.615
You'll see.

01:22:27.694 --> 01:22:28.462
Seriously?

01:22:28.496 --> 01:22:30.331
This is creepy!

01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:32.666
You were doing all of this
for Liz.

01:22:33.734 --> 01:22:35.403
No.

01:22:35.435 --> 01:22:37.304
No?

01:22:37.337 --> 01:22:39.106
Well, her grave is right there,

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:40.508
so why don't you get out
and you tell her?

01:22:40.541 --> 01:22:41.542
What?

01:22:41.574 --> 01:22:42.777
Why don't you tell her

01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:45.746
that you've been lying

01:22:45.779 --> 01:22:48.316
and fighting,

01:22:48.349 --> 01:22:50.751
and sneaking out, and hangin'
out in alleys and terrifying

01:22:50.783 --> 01:22:53.186
your parents,
because you think

01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:54.521
that is what your best friend
wanted.

01:22:54.555 --> 01:22:56.124
Mom, please stop!

01:22:56.157 --> 01:22:57.324
- No, go!
- No!

01:22:57.358 --> 01:22:59.793
Please, Eva,
go and tell her!

01:23:04.597 --> 01:23:06.734
Honey, I love you, okay?

01:23:11.238 --> 01:23:14.175
You know this, huh?

01:23:14.207 --> 01:23:15.675
You know this

01:23:26.252 --> 01:23:28.389
Hey.

01:23:28.421 --> 01:23:30.290
Hey.

01:23:32.792 --> 01:23:35.563
You know, I've only been
to five funerals in my life

01:23:37.463 --> 01:23:39.333
and none for anyone
that was close to me.

01:23:43.938 --> 01:23:46.908
The truth is I haven't been
through anything close

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.876
to what you're dealing with and
I think that's why I keep

01:23:48.908 --> 01:23:51.511
screwing this up.

01:23:51.545 --> 01:23:53.780
I screwed up, too.

01:23:53.814 --> 01:23:55.283
The important thing is you're
home.

01:23:58.385 --> 01:24:01.155
There's something else, I just
don't know how to fix it.

01:24:02.389 --> 01:24:04.159
You wanna tell me what it is?

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:10.664
I think as people screw up,
it's what we do.

01:24:11.899 --> 01:24:14.302
The character is admitting
what you've done

01:24:14.335 --> 01:24:15.903
and facing the consequences.

01:24:17.438 --> 01:24:20.307
And changing your behavior.

01:24:24.912 --> 01:24:26.247
I'm glad you're home.

01:24:32.653 --> 01:24:33.654
- Hey.
- Hey, what

01:24:33.686 --> 01:24:36.556
Your mom said I can come up.

01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:38.960
Okay,

01:24:38.993 --> 01:24:40.895
but why are you here?

01:24:42.496 --> 01:24:45.399
Oh, I heard about what happened.

01:24:45.431 --> 01:24:47.768
Uh.

01:24:47.801 --> 01:24:49.637
Here comes the full pity.

01:24:49.670 --> 01:24:51.505
I'm full touched.

01:24:51.537 --> 01:24:53.473
I'm not here because of pity.

01:24:56.277 --> 01:24:57.545
I'm here to confess.

01:25:02.416 --> 01:25:04.585
I put Viagra in your drink
before your match.

01:25:04.618 --> 01:25:05.886
You what?

01:25:05.918 --> 01:25:08.456
I'm sorry it was
supposed to be a prank.

01:25:08.488 --> 01:25:11.558
It was payback for the fight

01:25:11.591 --> 01:25:14.561
and all of the mean things
you've ever said to me.

01:25:14.595 --> 01:25:16.497
I did not think that
it would end up this way.

01:25:16.529 --> 01:25:17.965
You're sorry?

01:25:17.997 --> 01:25:20.333
Do you have any idea
what you have done?

01:25:22.002 --> 01:25:24.672
Ben,

01:25:24.704 --> 01:25:27.375
no one thinks you're gay.

01:25:27.408 --> 01:25:30.278
Trust me, no one actually
believes that.

01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:33.313
Oh my God.

01:25:33.346 --> 01:25:35.382
You really are clueless.

01:25:37.685 --> 01:25:40.421
Yeah,

01:25:40.453 --> 01:25:42.923
not the way that
I planned on coming out.

01:25:46.827 --> 01:25:49.597
And you know, what's worse

01:25:49.630 --> 01:25:51.733
is my dad was there.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.005
He finally comes to
one of my matches

01:25:59.739 --> 01:26:01.809
and now he won't even look me
in the eye.

01:26:07.046 --> 01:26:09.449
What did you think was gonna
happen here, huh?

01:26:10.150 --> 01:26:12.987
That um, that I'd forgive you?

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:15.489
That we'd hug it out and become
best buds?

01:26:15.521 --> 01:26:17.757
Oh, maybe uh,

01:26:17.791 --> 01:26:20.394
we could run as co-presidents.

01:26:20.426 --> 01:26:23.331
I'm gay, and she's morally
reprehensible,

01:26:23.363 --> 01:26:24.964
and we want your votes.

01:26:24.997 --> 01:26:27.335
I don't even care about being
president!

01:26:27.368 --> 01:26:28.903
Yeah, but I do!

01:26:28.935 --> 01:26:31.538
I have wanted this since
I was 10.

01:26:32.706 --> 01:26:34.775
So yeah,

01:26:34.807 --> 01:26:37.377
you managed
to screw me over

01:26:37.411 --> 01:26:40.081
in every possible way.

01:26:40.113 --> 01:26:43.016
No, you are not forgiven!

01:26:46.619 --> 01:26:48.456
I am so sorry.

01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:52.859
Really.

01:27:01.734 --> 01:27:04.604
Good afternoon, juniors!

01:27:04.637 --> 01:27:05.972
Ow!

01:27:08.742 --> 01:27:11.378
Unfortunately, Ben Hallster will
not be able to join us today

01:27:11.412 --> 01:27:13.012
for speeches.

01:27:13.046 --> 01:27:15.850
Therefore,
Eva Jeffries will be the only candidate

01:27:15.882 --> 01:27:18.653
for senior class president who
will be making a speech.

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:22.088
So without further ado,

01:27:22.122 --> 01:27:24.158
please welcome Eva Jeffries.

01:27:34.067 --> 01:27:35.069
Hello.

01:27:36.103 --> 01:27:37.771
I am Eva Jeffries

01:27:37.805 --> 01:27:39.974
and I am running for senior
class president.

01:27:45.179 --> 01:27:48.082
The school deserves
a president

01:27:48.114 --> 01:27:50.984
who is driven, focused,

01:27:51.018 --> 01:27:53.621
and dedicated on serving the
school and the amazing class.

01:27:56.489 --> 01:27:59.059
One of the two candidates
embodies all of those traits

01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:02.729
and the other's a complete
asshole.

01:28:10.904 --> 01:28:13.107
To be clear, I am that asshole.

01:28:16.909 --> 01:28:19.579
I don't deserve to
be present of anything.

01:28:20.948 --> 01:28:23.551
Ben Hallster is far
and away the best candidate

01:28:23.583 --> 01:28:25.185
for senior class president.

01:28:27.753 --> 01:28:30.724
Therefore, I am formally
withdrawing

01:28:30.756 --> 01:28:32.792
my candidacy
and instead ask you

01:28:32.826 --> 01:28:34.494
to vote for Ben Hallster.

01:29:01.087 --> 01:29:02.222
Alright, calm down, everyone.

01:29:02.256 --> 01:29:04.025
We still have more speeches.

01:29:09.296 --> 01:29:10.931
So I've been wanting
to talk to you guys

01:29:10.963 --> 01:29:13.934
about something important.

01:29:13.966 --> 01:29:17.036
I mean it's important to me.

01:29:17.069 --> 01:29:19.840
Of course, you can talk to us
about anything, kiddo.

01:29:21.542 --> 01:29:23.744
I'm not gonna go to Hawaii
this summer.

01:29:23.777 --> 01:29:26.514
I wanna stay and take a class.

01:29:26.546 --> 01:29:29.250
Hmm,
is it the graphic novel class

01:29:29.283 --> 01:29:31.486
that MariNoami is teaching?

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.289
How'd you know about that?

01:29:35.322 --> 01:29:37.591
I saw Liz's post when I was
going through your computer.

01:29:37.623 --> 01:29:39.592
You went through
my computer?

01:29:39.626 --> 01:29:41.962
Hey, you ran away,
we went through your everything.

01:29:41.994 --> 01:29:43.730
I looked at the class,
it's really expensive,

01:29:43.764 --> 01:29:45.666
isn't it?

01:29:45.698 --> 01:29:47.902
Yeah, but I can pay
for myself.

01:29:49.269 --> 01:29:52.139
I just need a loan, so I can get
it registered now.

01:29:52.171 --> 01:29:54.509
But this summer, I'll get a job,
so I can pay you guys back.

01:29:55.775 --> 01:29:57.077
Sounds like she
has it all figured out.

01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:58.845
Yes, it does.

01:29:58.878 --> 01:30:00.547
There's only one problem.

01:30:10.791 --> 01:30:11.958
What does this mean?

01:30:11.992 --> 01:30:14.595
It means we already
signed you up.

01:30:15.962 --> 01:30:17.630
We were gonna give it to you
for your birthday,

01:30:17.663 --> 01:30:18.898
but you had to go and ruin it.

01:30:18.931 --> 01:30:20.800
No, it is not ruined.

01:30:20.833 --> 01:30:22.101
- Good.
- Definitely not.

01:30:22.135 --> 01:30:24.637
One condition, you have to get
your grades up.

01:30:24.671 --> 01:30:25.706
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:30:25.738 --> 01:30:27.106
- I promise.
- Good.

01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:28.142
Thank you, mom.

01:30:30.243 --> 01:30:31.612
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

01:30:31.645 --> 01:30:32.680
You're welcome, kiddo.

01:30:32.712 --> 01:30:35.282
Oh my gosh, wow!

01:30:35.314 --> 01:30:36.149
I was not expecting that.

01:30:36.182 --> 01:30:37.118
Okay.

01:30:40.953 --> 01:30:42.155
I saw some of her stuff online.

01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:43.324
Yeah, she's great.

01:30:43.356 --> 01:30:45.893
So what were you most excited
about?

01:30:48.395 --> 01:30:50.698
Okay, I'm gonna stop you right
here and warn you

01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:53.132
that if I do not win
in the junior prom queen,

01:30:53.166 --> 01:30:54.234
I'm gonna take this
whole place down.

01:30:54.266 --> 01:30:55.702
- Okay.
- Like Carrie style.

01:30:55.735 --> 01:30:56.636
Yep, got it.

01:30:56.670 --> 01:30:58.271
Okay, let's go.

01:30:58.305 --> 01:30:59.974
Hey, Jeffries.

01:31:00.006 --> 01:31:01.140
Ben, hi.

01:31:01.173 --> 01:31:03.777
Nice job uh,
decorating this place.

01:31:03.810 --> 01:31:04.311
Thank you.

01:31:04.344 --> 01:31:05.779
You look sharp.

01:31:05.811 --> 01:31:06.680
- So good.
- Yes.

01:31:06.712 --> 01:31:08.349
- Love the tux.
- Yes.

01:31:08.381 --> 01:31:10.717
Yeah, I decided to go Gatsby.

01:31:10.751 --> 01:31:13.387
I look terrible in Hawaiian
print, as does everyone.

01:31:15.988 --> 01:31:16.789
He's funny.

01:31:16.823 --> 01:31:17.925
Yeah.

01:31:17.957 --> 01:31:19.225
I heard about your speech.

01:31:19.259 --> 01:31:22.163
Oh, it was so badass.

01:31:22.896 --> 01:31:26.000
- You didn't have to.
- Yeah, I did.

01:31:26.033 --> 01:31:28.335
Well, he's gonna make
the best class president

01:31:28.368 --> 01:31:30.070
this school's ever seen.

01:31:30.103 --> 01:31:32.806
The best ever really.

01:31:32.838 --> 01:31:34.807
I guess I'll see you around.

01:31:34.841 --> 01:31:35.409
Okay.

01:31:35.442 --> 01:31:36.377
Bye.

01:31:36.409 --> 01:31:38.244
Bye.

01:31:39.445 --> 01:31:41.814
Joey, hey!

01:31:41.847 --> 01:31:42.850
Hey, come here.

01:31:42.882 --> 01:31:44.050
Come on.

01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:45.853
Hi.

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:50.289
Oh, okay, well, um,

01:31:50.323 --> 01:31:52.426
I'm gonna go find
a real date.

01:31:52.458 --> 01:31:54.662
I'll see you assholes later.

01:31:57.463 --> 01:31:59.899
So I uh, have something
of yours.

01:32:06.472 --> 01:32:08.242
I thought my parents
found this.

01:32:08.274 --> 01:32:11.411
They almost did.

01:32:11.444 --> 01:32:14.180
So you saved my ass after I lied
and stole your car?

01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:18.851
Did you finish it?

01:32:18.885 --> 01:32:20.320
The list?

01:32:20.353 --> 01:32:22.056
I did everything but one,
the rock star thing,

01:32:22.088 --> 01:32:24.257
but I don't care.

01:32:29.061 --> 01:32:31.164
I know I have a lot to
make up for,

01:32:33.065 --> 01:32:35.969
but I was just wondering
if maybe you could forgive me

01:32:36.002 --> 01:32:37.905
and we could still
be friends.

01:32:37.938 --> 01:32:39.907
Yeah, come with me.

01:32:39.939 --> 01:32:41.007
- Joey.
- Mmhmm, yep.

01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:45.179
Well, I need you to
do me a solid,

01:32:45.212 --> 01:32:46.780
my girl is gonna
can sing a song.

01:32:46.813 --> 01:32:48.449
Got you the song right there.

01:32:50.082 --> 01:32:51.884
You are becoming a rock star.

01:32:51.917 --> 01:32:52.952
No, I cannot do that.

01:32:52.985 --> 01:32:54.988
Yes, you can, you have to.

01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:56.890
Otherwise,
what was it all for?

01:32:58.925 --> 01:33:00.795
Hey, you got this.

01:33:06.265 --> 01:33:08.134
Go ahead now.

01:33:08.167 --> 01:33:10.136
Alright, I'mma step aside
for a bit and turn things over

01:33:10.170 --> 01:33:12.806
to The Daniel High's very own

01:33:12.838 --> 01:33:13.974
Give her some love!

Hi, everybody:

01:35:51.497 --> 01:35:53.900
Hi, I'm MariNaomi

01:35:53.934 --> 01:35:56.403
and I'm here to help you find
your voice,

01:35:56.435 --> 01:35:58.905
so that you could tell
your own story.

01:35:58.939 --> 01:36:01.075
Now,
has anyone here done a comic before?

01:36:02.175 --> 01:36:03.177
Oh, excellent.

01:36:08.614 --> 01:36:09.448
Headin' out.

01:36:09.481 --> 01:36:11.184
Oh, just a sec.

01:36:11.216 --> 01:36:12.618
Um, these are from us.

01:36:12.652 --> 01:36:14.087
Oh, okay.

01:36:14.119 --> 01:36:15.555
Are you sure
you don't want me to come?

01:36:15.587 --> 01:36:17.123
Yeah.

01:36:17.157 --> 01:36:18.091
Okay.

01:36:18.123 --> 01:36:19.659
Well, send her love.

01:36:19.693 --> 01:36:20.994
Okay.

01:36:37.609 --> 01:36:40.313
Hey.

01:36:40.346 --> 01:36:42.615
Sorry, it's taken me so long
to come here.

01:36:45.185 --> 01:36:46.387
These are from my parents.

01:36:54.159 --> 01:36:55.328
This is so strange.

01:36:59.265 --> 01:37:01.335
I hope you're not too pissed
about me and Joey.

01:37:03.302 --> 01:37:05.238
I never intended.

01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:12.145
So much has changed since
you left.

01:37:17.583 --> 01:37:19.519
I did the list.

01:37:20.619 --> 01:37:21.988
The entire thing.

01:37:23.622 --> 01:37:25.257
I pinched a guy in the ass,

01:37:25.291 --> 01:37:28.095
stole someone's car,
became a rock star.

01:37:30.195 --> 01:37:31.698
I wish you were there.

01:37:35.268 --> 01:37:37.304
But the Ben thing

01:37:39.238 --> 01:37:40.539
Yeah, I really messed that up.

01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:46.713
I hurt a lot of people badly

01:37:49.815 --> 01:37:51.550
and in the end,
none of it brought you

01:37:51.583 --> 01:37:53.252
back to me.

01:37:56.389 --> 01:37:59.159
I really miss you and I do not
know how to let you go.

01:38:04.764 --> 01:38:07.801
But there is

01:38:07.833 --> 01:38:10.670
one way I know how to
keep you

01:38:10.703 --> 01:38:12.172

01:38:19.679 --> 01:38:21.648
I hope you enjoy it.

01:38:24.484 --> 01:38:26.253

came from.

01:38:30.556 --> 01:38:33.059
