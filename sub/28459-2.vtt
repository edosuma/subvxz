on you losing weight."

that says a lot right there.

17:54.667 --> 17:57.367

23:37.033 --> 23:38.500

to get your nipple.

23:39.734 --> 23:41.500
Don't do it.
Amelia, don't.

Oh, God!

23:45.233 --> 23:47.433
Where are you coming from?

23:47.467 --> 23:48.767
- My nails.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.400
It's so sad.

23:50.433 --> 23:53.400
There was this mom and daughter

23:53.433 --> 23:56.633
who just, like, really looked
like they were suffering.

23:56.667 --> 24:00.400
- Skinny?
Really thin?

24:00.433 --> 24:03.133
- It's, like, sad for me
to see a skinny person

24:03.166 --> 24:05.100
and have to identify that
with an eating disorder.

24:05.133 --> 24:06.100
You know what I mean?

24:06.133 --> 24:07.767
- A year ago,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.367
we found out that something was
going on with Amelia.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.533
I could see it.

24:11.567 --> 24:13.100
My response to it at first was,

24:13.133 --> 24:14.633
you know, "You got to eat."

24:14.667 --> 24:16.500
And of course it scared
the sh-- out of me.

24:16.533 --> 24:19.100
I know it scared the sh--
out of Harry.

24:19.133 --> 24:21.200

no matter how much blindness,
how much hair loss,

24:28.033 --> 24:30.700
all I cared about
was the skinniness.

24:30.734 --> 24:33.000
It's hard, and I don't want
what happened to me

24:33.033 --> 24:34.000
to happen to other people.

24:34.033 --> 24:35.600

24:35.633 --> 24:37.500

24:37.533 --> 24:39.700

when your child is suffering.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.133
You feel totally helpless.

24:44.166 --> 24:46.533

of my friends

24:46.567 --> 24:48.633
and I'm sure every single one
of your friends,

24:48.667 --> 24:50.133
they think about
how many calories

24:50.166 --> 24:51.767
they're consuming in a day,
how many--

24:52.000 --> 24:53.600
When they sit down for a meal...
- We all do, of course.

24:53.633 --> 24:55.400
- They look at the bread basket,
and they think, "Holy sh--."

24:55.433 --> 24:57.166
Like, you know what I mean?

24:57.200 --> 24:59.567
- Amelia started watching
food shows,

24:59.600 --> 25:01.433
and I thought, "That is
the weirdest ----ing thing ever.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.600
Why would you want
to see people eat?"

25:03.633 --> 25:05.166

this is her trying--

25:05.200 --> 25:06.467

all the pizza, does she?

25:06.500 --> 25:08.200

your kids are ----ed up

25:16.066 --> 25:17.567

25:17.600 --> 25:19.066
And I've never had anorexia.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.166

25:40.300 --> 25:42.233

25:42.266 --> 25:45.300
and she opened up to me
about her own struggle.

25:45.333 --> 25:49.133
She came to Hollywood,
and her agent said to her,

25:49.166 --> 25:52.233
"They want you to lose"--
I want to say ten pounds.

25:52.266 --> 25:53.233
- Oh, sh--.

25:53.266 --> 25:54.600
- She stopped acting

25:54.633 --> 25:57.667
and basically gained
200 pounds,

25:57.700 --> 25:59.533
because it triggered her
the other way.

have shown them

26:16.533 --> 26:18.734

I need to say about anorexia,

26:22.367 --> 26:24.700

so many girls commenting

26:24.734 --> 26:26.200

26:30.100 --> 26:31.233

out of it.

26:31.266 --> 26:34.233

26:34.266 --> 26:38.166
I was shocked.
I was beyond proud.

31:53.033 --> 31:55.200
is a bit of a challenge.

31:55.233 --> 31:57.033
It's just like
suddenly being away.

31:57.066 --> 32:00.300
But then again, I could do
with a break, dear God.

32:00.333 --> 32:02.233
- You've got Kyle there.

32:02.266 --> 32:03.567
You always have fun with her.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.266
Dorit.
- I love Dorit.

32:05.300 --> 32:07.433
But sometimes Dorit
calls it wrong,

32:07.467 --> 32:09.467
as we know and we've seen.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.400
So sometimes it's hard
to defend her,

32:11.433 --> 32:13.066
if you know what I'm saying.

32:13.100 --> 32:14.433
I've tried my best;
that's for sure.

32:14.467 --> 32:16.266
It's just been
kind of exasperating,

32:16.300 --> 32:19.333
really, the way Dorit handled
the whole dog thing,

32:19.367 --> 32:21.333
and it ended up
in a kill shelter.

32:21.367 --> 32:24.000
It was easy; she just needed
to give the dog back to us.

32:24.033 --> 32:25.467
But you know what?

32:25.500 --> 32:27.400
I love her anyway,
and that's the way Dorit rolls.

32:27.433 --> 32:29.533
Maybe you're right.
Maybe it would do me good.

32:29.567 --> 32:30.567
Oh, okay, good.
Thank you.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.433
All right, I'm gonna go.

32:32.467 --> 32:35.133
I'm gonna take the plunge
and start having fun again.

32:35.166 --> 32:36.567
- Here's to fun.

32:36.600 --> 32:39.166
- You're not having any fun
when I'm gone.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.633
Trust me.
You're going to work.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.400
- [laughs]

32:42.433 --> 32:44.100
- Coming up...

32:44.133 --> 32:45.567
- My visuals of you and Aaron
having sex

32:45.600 --> 32:48.166
are, like, right up there
with my favorite porn.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.400
[laughter]
That's real--

32:54.367 --> 32:54.667
- Hi, sweetie.

32:55.633 --> 32:57.300
How are you?

32:57.333 --> 32:59.166
- Thank you for having me.
- Come on in.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.400
- Hey.
- Hi!

33:00.433 --> 33:01.600
- How are you?
- That's Chris...

33:01.633 --> 33:03.467
- Hi, Chris.
- Our fabulous chef.

33:03.500 --> 33:04.600
- Very nice to meet you.

33:04.633 --> 33:06.467
- Gloves on.
- Okay.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.200
- So in the center
of the table,

33:08.233 --> 33:10.200
we have salted caramel,
almond marshmallow,

33:10.233 --> 33:12.533
vanilla shortbread,
vanilla meringue.

33:12.567 --> 33:14.266
You can fill your heart
with whatever you'd like.

33:14.300 --> 33:15.667
- Oh, I like that.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.333
- Could be for your kids
or your husband, but--

33:17.367 --> 33:18.667
So I thought it would be cute

33:18.700 --> 33:20.133
if we write, like,
a little love note.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.500
So we'll put that on top

33:21.533 --> 33:23.300
of all your little pastries
we put inside.

33:23.333 --> 33:25.266
- So we're writing a note
to whomever we want?

33:25.300 --> 33:28.567
- Yeah, I'm writing to David
about our new life together.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.133
- Aw!
- Let's fill these up.

33:31.166 --> 33:32.500
- Are these two caramels
different?

33:32.533 --> 33:34.300
- Nope, they're the same.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.133
- I think mine's full.

33:36.166 --> 33:37.667
- Okay, so then you can put
your note right on top.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.533
- Wait, we put the note
on top of the candy?

33:39.567 --> 33:41.567
- On top of the candy.
- Oh!

33:41.600 --> 33:43.266
- That way,
that's the first thing,

33:43.300 --> 33:45.133
so they'll see the note
and be like....

33:45.166 --> 33:46.734
- Aw.
- Love notes.

33:46.767 --> 33:48.633
- This is really a good idea.
- I love this idea.

33:48.667 --> 33:51.233
- I'm loving this.
- I'm glad you like it.

33:51.266 --> 33:52.367
- This is the tricky part.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.200
We'll melt...
- Oh!

33:54.233 --> 33:56.333
I mean, really,
how hard is this gonna be?

33:56.367 --> 33:57.633
We're gonna take two pieces
of chocolate

33:57.667 --> 33:59.233
and put them together,
and, like,

33:59.266 --> 34:00.700
make it nice around the edges.

34:00.734 --> 34:02.700
Who's gonna (BLEEP) up
besides me?

34:02.734 --> 34:04.734
- And then freeze spray.

34:04.767 --> 34:06.767
- Oh, how cool.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.433
- I don't know about the back,

34:08.467 --> 34:10.433
but the top of my sh--
is flawless.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.533
[laughter]

34:12.567 --> 34:14.266
- So this is the fun part,

34:14.300 --> 34:15.766
'cause you're just gonna
pour it all over.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.567
- Oh!
[people cheering]

34:17.600 --> 34:19.734
- I wouldn't really
refer to this

34:19.766 --> 34:22.367
as baking or pastry,

34:22.400 --> 34:25.367
because there's
no ----ing dough.

34:25.400 --> 34:26.667
I don't know how
it's even called

34:26.699 --> 34:29.266
a pastry class, I'm sorry.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.632
- Ooh, that looks cool.

34:30.667 --> 34:33.266
You could dip your whole body
in that in a bathtub.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.766
- [laughs]
- Kind of like "Goldfinger."

34:36.000 --> 34:38.400
- Yes.
- That's what you're gonna do.

34:38.433 --> 34:40.333
You Bond lady.

34:40.367 --> 34:42.367
- Oh, cool!

34:42.400 --> 34:43.632
- This is so chic.

34:43.667 --> 34:45.333
- Love that.
- Very chic.

34:45.367 --> 34:47.367
- So this was all, like,
the hard work, right?

34:47.400 --> 34:49.000
- Oh, yeah,
that was very hard.

34:49.033 --> 34:50.467
- So we got to go
to the next room for the love.

34:50.500 --> 34:53.367
- Ooh.
- Oh, my gosh.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.567
- This is so nice.
- Wow, how pretty!

34:56.600 --> 34:58.433
- This is a love den.

34:58.467 --> 35:00.700
- Are these edible flowers?
- Yup.

35:00.734 --> 35:02.667
Each petal is hand painted,
set in a mold,

35:02.700 --> 35:05.467
and then we place it
each individual one.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.700
- Wow, it's so beautiful.

35:07.734 --> 35:09.633
- I haven't eaten anything
but candy today.

35:09.667 --> 35:11.400
- That's a good day--
candy and champagne.

35:11.433 --> 35:12.667
- Yeah, right?
- Sugar, sugar, sugar.

35:12.700 --> 35:14.567
I eat dessert
every day of my life,

35:14.600 --> 35:17.400
because it's one of the things
that really brings me pleasure.

35:17.433 --> 35:19.767
- This is the small piece.
- Oh, my God.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.300
Well, no one's here to see me,
so it's okay.

35:22.333 --> 35:23.333
- Enjoy.

35:23.367 --> 35:24.767
- That's just my life,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.367
and I'm not ----ing making
any excuses for it.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.000
Mmm.

35:30.033 --> 35:31.767
Superb.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.600
- I don't want to eat this.
It's so pretty.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.467
- I would love
to take mine home, if I can.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.767
- You can.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.633
- I promise you
you're not gonna blow up.

35:39.667 --> 35:41.400
And so what if you do?
You get it off.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.400
Eat the ----ing cake.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.000
- Lisa?
- Yes?

35:45.033 --> 35:48.467
- I am gonna have to top this
in the Bahamas.

35:48.500 --> 35:49.600
- Okay, Dorit.
Do it!

35:49.633 --> 35:50.600
- I mean, goodness.

35:50.633 --> 35:51.633
I left you a voicemail.

35:51.667 --> 35:53.467
I haven't heard from you.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.000
- I know. I was trying to get
through the specifics.

35:55.033 --> 35:56.500
- You have to come.
- Yes, I'm coming.

35:56.533 --> 35:57.600
- And you, I know that you--
- I'm good.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.233
- Yes, you're good?

35:59.266 --> 36:01.200
- No, Aaron can take care
of the kids, and--

36:01.233 --> 36:02.467
- She's a good time.

36:02.500 --> 36:03.533
- Okay, I have a question
for you.

36:03.567 --> 36:05.066
How did you meet Aaron?

36:05.100 --> 36:07.266
- So I met him at his center

36:07.300 --> 36:09.734
doing DNA repair and anti-aging
and that sort of thing.

36:09.767 --> 36:12.767
And then one time, we had sex
in one of his rooms.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.600
- That was the treatment.

36:14.633 --> 36:16.700
- And we've been inseparable
ever since.

36:16.734 --> 36:18.567
- That is so great!

36:18.600 --> 36:20.734
My visuals of you and Aaron
having sex

36:20.767 --> 36:22.633
are, like, right up there
with my favorite porn.

36:22.667 --> 36:25.367
[laughter]
That's real ----ing good.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.700
Real ----ing good.

36:26.734 --> 36:28.400
- We like to have a good time.
- I can tell.

36:28.433 --> 36:30.433
- I am actually very flattered

36:30.467 --> 36:34.633
that Erika thinks of Aaron
and I having sex.

36:34.667 --> 36:36.767
It's definitely a turn-on.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.700
He's technically still married.
- Okay.

36:39.734 --> 36:42.767
- They've been split
for over two years, but it's--

36:43.000 --> 36:44.633
- I've been going through
the same thing.

36:44.667 --> 36:46.433
- So once it's final,
we're getting married.

36:46.467 --> 36:48.467
- Harry was married to her
for 11 months,

36:48.500 --> 36:50.100
and, what, Aaron was six?

36:50.133 --> 36:52.000
- The same person?
- Yes.

36:52.033 --> 36:54.000
- Wait, wait, wait.
I didn't know this!

36:54.033 --> 36:55.367
Whoo!
- Hold on.

36:55.400 --> 36:56.567
- I did not know that!

36:56.600 --> 36:58.400
- Denise's boyfriend

36:58.433 --> 37:00.266
was married
to Nicollette Sheridan.

37:00.300 --> 37:01.700
He's still married
to Nicollette.

37:01.734 --> 37:05.000
And Harry was married to her
for a hot minute.

37:05.033 --> 37:06.400
So there's that.

37:06.433 --> 37:09.467
So yeah,
we have some intertwining...

37:09.500 --> 37:12.400
stuff going on, don't we?

37:12.433 --> 37:15.266
Okay, Harry was married
to her 30 years ago.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.667
The story is, she went
to a Michael Bolton concert

37:17.700 --> 37:19.000
at the Hollywood Bowl.

37:19.033 --> 37:20.400
- No way.
- Swear to God.

37:20.433 --> 37:22.500
- And left him, and that was it?
- Yes.

37:22.533 --> 37:24.400
- Is that really true?

37:24.433 --> 37:25.467
- (BLEEP), yes!

37:25.500 --> 37:27.000
Harry was in Canada.

37:27.033 --> 37:28.567
I thank Michael Bolton
to this day.

37:28.600 --> 37:32.133
Are you kidding me?
Let's cheers Michael Bolton!

37:32.166 --> 37:34.033
- Yeah, Michael Bolton!
- Thank you, Michael Bolton,

37:34.066 --> 37:35.533
because I would not have
these beautiful children.

37:35.567 --> 37:37.133
- That's right.

37:37.166 --> 37:39.433
- I mean, I really never got
that urge

37:39.467 --> 37:40.700
when I saw Michael Bolton

37:40.734 --> 37:43.433
with that ponytail
and the music video.

37:43.467 --> 37:46.700
But I guess
a life of a rock star.

37:46.734 --> 37:48.333
- How did you meet Edwin?

37:48.367 --> 37:49.500
- I was with
a bunch of girlfriends,

37:49.533 --> 37:50.567
sitting at dinner,

37:50.600 --> 37:52.300
and there was a club next door.

37:52.333 --> 37:54.066
And as I'm walking in,
he was leaving,

37:54.100 --> 37:56.000
and he turned around
and followed me back in.

37:56.033 --> 37:58.700
We pretty much consummated
the relationship night one.

37:58.734 --> 38:00.567
- That's good.
- Whoo!

38:00.600 --> 38:02.700
- When I met him,
he had the ponytail.

38:02.734 --> 38:05.333
Now it's creep--
- Yeah, it's creeping back in.

38:05.367 --> 38:06.734
- If you're not
sexually attracted to him,

38:06.767 --> 38:08.333
he needs to cut
that ----ing thing off.

38:08.367 --> 38:10.066
- I'm sexually attracted
to him.

38:10.100 --> 38:12.000
- Okay, so how many times a week
is it?

38:12.033 --> 38:14.467
- Two.
I'm very scheduled.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.133
- Of course you are!

38:16.166 --> 38:20.033
- It's not like--
- "Sex on Thursday at 5:45."

38:20.066 --> 38:22.066
- Do you put it in a calendar?
- You do?

38:22.100 --> 38:24.700
- It's not in a calendar
unless it's, like, a big night.

38:24.734 --> 38:27.467
- Aaron and I have sex
every day.

38:27.500 --> 38:31.433
So--when--unless, of course,
I'm out of town.

38:31.467 --> 38:33.600
And even then,
we'll do it on Facetime.

38:33.633 --> 38:36.066
- What if you did it, like,
five times in a week?

38:36.100 --> 38:37.700
- Well, then that was
a really good week for us.

38:37.734 --> 38:39.734
- Okay.
