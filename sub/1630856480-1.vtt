09:50.214 --> 09:53.676
So, first off,
how is this less comfortable than that?

09:53.759 --> 09:56.512
-That's very comfortable.
-Why are you in that and not this?

09:56.596 --> 09:59.432
I'm in the man cave,
"Oh, there it is." I put it on.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.435
Okay. When you're not in the man cave,
what are you wearing?

10:02.518 --> 10:05.146
-Probably jeans because I got--
-Show me.

10:05.646 --> 10:08.316
Nothing here.
Yeah, this is pretty much dress clothes.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.859
The rest of your clothes are?

10:10.943 --> 10:13.779
This closet is only for formal wear.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.823
The rest of the clothes are where?

10:17.074 --> 10:17.908
-So…
-[Ernest] Socks.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.118
-[Tan] Socks.
-As you can see.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.578
T-shirts.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.580
I've lived almost 40 years.

10:22.663 --> 10:28.085
I've never seen someone use
a filing cabinet as a set of drawers.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.589
This is mostly
your actual day-to-day wear in here.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.591
Right. Now, you see, the…

10:33.674 --> 10:37.428
The waist was too big,
so I put a cable tie on it, you know,

10:37.511 --> 10:38.638
instead of a belt.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.015
A cable tie works pretty good,
so I zip tie it.

10:41.098 --> 10:41.932
No.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.520
-No. No one's gonna take you seriously.
-[laughs]

10:46.604 --> 10:48.272
[Tan] This is all underwear?

10:48.356 --> 10:50.858
You keep your underwear clean?
No holes? That's not…

10:50.941 --> 10:52.485
It's practically a thong!

10:52.568 --> 10:54.195
That's a really loose thong.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.447
-This can never happen again.
-Right.

10:56.530 --> 10:58.074
Miranda's not interested in this.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.117
No, ma'am.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.661
And then talk to me about suspenders.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.080
You know,
I wear suspenders because it's functional

11:04.163 --> 11:05.873
and because I like to be unique.

11:05.956 --> 11:07.958
So you do care about what people think!

11:08.042 --> 11:10.461
-Pretty much, yeah.
-And yet you're still in scrubs.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.088
-[Ernest] Right.
-We'll figure it out.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.422
All right. Good deal.

11:13.506 --> 11:17.510
Ooh, someone's got expensive taste.

11:17.593 --> 11:18.719
[Bobby] Speaking of pictures…

11:18.803 --> 11:21.514
-[Jonathan] Ooh, Let me see.
-There's Miranda.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.683
[Jonathan] I love her Farrah Fawcett hair.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.644
Oh my God!
That's a picture of them on their wedding.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.730
-[Karamo] There we go.
-[Jonathan] Such young and crazy kids.

11:29.814 --> 11:30.856
[Karamo] They're beautiful.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.775
I'm gonna hold onto this photo.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.403
[Bobby] Some chipping paint
in the living room.

11:35.486 --> 11:36.821
[upbeat music playing]

11:36.904 --> 11:37.738
Huh.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.241
[Bobby] One of the things
that I noticed about the home

11:40.324 --> 11:44.036
is it feels
like they've kind of given up on it.

11:45.162 --> 11:48.374
Just like their relationship,
they've let the home grow stale.

11:48.457 --> 11:51.085
Oh. Okay. Okay.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.212
[Antoni] Oh, this is beautiful.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.465
-Is this your garden or Miranda's garden?
-[Ernest] It's our garden.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.384
-[Antoni] Both of you together.
-[Ernest] Yeah.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.969
My gosh, look at that monarch.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.139
[Ernest] Usually, they got about three
or five flying around all the time.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.432
[Antoni] Other than the garden,

12:04.515 --> 12:08.769
is there anything else you do together
that's special, just for the two of you?

12:08.853 --> 12:11.981
No. You know, like,
it needs to start to build back up.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.567
-Yeah.
-You know, build that relationship up.

12:14.650 --> 12:17.278
Add the proverbial and the literal spice,
if you will.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.571
Yeah, sounds good. [chuckles]

12:18.654 --> 12:20.197
This is called a hammer.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.324
This is called a screwdriver.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.453
When you need to level something,
you pull this out,

12:25.536 --> 12:27.329
and it tells you if it's level or not.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.039
You're welcome.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.417
-[Antoni] These are snap beans.
-[Ernest] Yes. They're good.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.294
Really good.
They have a nice sweetness.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.296
Ooh, those look like
hotter peppers, right?

12:35.379 --> 12:37.631
[Ernest] Yeah. Miranda likes spicy food.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.592
[Antoni] What's
her favorite type of protein?

12:39.675 --> 12:40.801
Fish.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.763
Wouldn't it be nice to make something
for her and blow her socks off?

12:43.846 --> 12:46.265
Yeah. Yeah. Fantastic.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.976
You failed the last time we did this.
Can you do it?

12:49.059 --> 12:51.145
-I can, but not with this pressure.
-Okay, go.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.105
No. No.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.357
-No!
-It's just falling down your body.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.317
[sobs]

12:56.400 --> 12:57.777
Don't fail again. Get it. No.

12:57.860 --> 12:58.694
Hold on. Hold on.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.362
-Better!
-[Bobby] She got better!

13:00.446 --> 13:02.740
[cheering]

13:02.823 --> 13:05.993
-Yeah! Yay, Jackie!
-[Jonathan] Yes! Yes!

13:06.076 --> 13:08.746
Get out of my face. You saw it!

13:09.747 --> 13:10.998
[Karamo] You know how to twerk?

13:11.081 --> 13:12.917
Oh! Oh!

13:13.000 --> 13:15.628
Yeah! [chuckles]

13:15.711 --> 13:18.464
-I can tell you're a good time.
-If you say it's good.

13:18.547 --> 13:19.465
I don't know.

13:19.548 --> 13:22.510
[Karamo] You might have to teach me.
I don't know nothing about cars.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.054
This is fantastic
because when I'm driving by myself,

13:25.137 --> 13:28.307
you know, like, about ten cars that pass
gonna honk their horn

13:28.390 --> 13:30.267
or you know, give me a thing, you know?

13:30.351 --> 13:34.146
When you're driving your car,
do you ever wish Miranda was next to you?

13:34.230 --> 13:36.690
Yes, but she says it's too loud.

13:36.774 --> 13:40.152
When you're here in the garage,
she doesn't like to come out here.

13:40.236 --> 13:46.325
No. We don't do a lot of things together
because we've been married 39 years.

13:46.408 --> 13:49.662
You know, like,
and it started out good, you know,

13:49.745 --> 13:51.163
but now it's on… you know.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.624
I guess it's just life.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.085
Do you think Miranda
is happy in your marriage?

13:57.336 --> 13:58.546
I would say no.

14:00.005 --> 14:03.092
-How does that make you feel?
-It makes me feel down.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.677
Do you feel like it's your fault?

14:04.760 --> 14:06.387
Well, I think it's a combination.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.681
It's a com… It's not all on me.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.015
It's not all on her.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.394
I want us to get back together,
but, you know, like, whatever, you know?

14:13.477 --> 14:16.981
When we start to say the "whatever,"
that's sort of a defense mechanism.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.023
[sighs]

14:18.107 --> 14:20.776
-I can tell you do love your wife.
-Yeah.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.029
It's okay to say, "I want my relationship
to be strong with my wife."

14:24.113 --> 14:26.615
I want my relationship
to be strong with my wife.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.409
Yes, I do. I truly do.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.786
-Well, then, brother, I can help you.
-[Ernest] Yes, sir.

14:31.787 --> 14:32.788
Appreciate it, man.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.874
[upbeat music playing]

14:35.749 --> 14:37.585
-[Karamo] Baby?
-[Jonathan] I hear someone.

14:37.668 --> 14:38.794
I have someone.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.130
Get on in this gorgeous bathroom, honey.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.798
Have fun, Ernest.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.217
[Jonathan] So, tell me, Ernest.
You wake up topless,

14:45.301 --> 14:46.802
and then what happens?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.429
-[Ernest] Do it like this.
-Oh shit.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.181
[gasps]

14:51.265 --> 14:53.434
A bubble pony on a beard?

14:54.393 --> 14:56.645
This straight man has style.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.230
Let's take it up a notch.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.983
I've had it, seeing this unbraided beard.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.902
-Was it a pandemic beard?
-[Ernest] Right.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.069
You braiding it?

15:04.153 --> 15:07.072
How's Miranda gonna be able
to turn you down with this braid?

15:07.156 --> 15:08.198
I hope she don't.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.909
My job here is done.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.827
Take your hat off, please.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.829
Still kind of bushy, though, you know?

15:15.289 --> 15:21.712
Ernest is giving skullet, which is
a skull, no hair, with mullet in the back.

15:22.463 --> 15:25.049
-Ever had extensions in your mullet?
-No.

15:25.132 --> 15:28.552
I'm gonna do waist-length extensions.
You can be a straight man's Cher.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.887
We could try it out.

15:29.970 --> 15:32.306
[Jonathan] And while he's
a really gorgeous man,

15:32.389 --> 15:34.099
there's a lot of look going on here,

15:34.183 --> 15:38.228
and I know that, between Tan and I,
we can preserve a unique style

15:38.312 --> 15:43.651
without having, like,
a full beard-skullet-mullet.

15:44.151 --> 15:49.156
When's the last time you got up and said,
"Ernest, you're looking good today"?

15:49.239 --> 15:50.616
[laughs]

15:51.492 --> 15:53.327
-This makes me sad.
-That's definitely a joint.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.204
[Bobby] Oh, is that the head? No.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.664
Your daddy had us try raccoon.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.040
-You're joking.
-I couldn't.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.792
Aren't you remotely curious?

15:59.875 --> 16:02.044
No, I'm not. They're like little pets.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.213
-[Ariel] Hey.
-Ariel and Miranda.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.590
-Very nice to meet you.
-It's so nice to meet you.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.092
-Bobby.
-Nice to meet you.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.802
-Very nice…
-Fellow food lover.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.845
Oh yes. Thank you.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.765
-How do you feel about the raccoon?
-I'm not that hungry.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.475
"I'm not that hungry."

16:16.558 --> 16:17.643
[laughs]

16:17.726 --> 16:19.728
[Antoni] So you're gonna show us
the butterflies?

16:19.812 --> 16:25.234
I have been raising monarchs
for over 25 years.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.360
-So…
-[Antoni] Whoa!

16:26.443 --> 16:28.946
[Karamo] So with all the things
that you do with the butterflies,

16:29.029 --> 16:31.073
are there things you wish
you and Ernest did together?

16:31.156 --> 16:33.575
-'Cause you're a young, vibrant woman.
-Yeah!

16:33.659 --> 16:35.577
We used to have date nights. You know--

16:35.661 --> 16:37.997
-[Karamo] What kind of date nights?
-Um, just dinner.

16:38.080 --> 16:42.418
Like, for our anniversary,
Ernest had a big splash of a date for us.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.712
-Where did he take you?
-Burger King!

16:44.795 --> 16:47.131
-We went to Burger King!
-Oh, wow!

16:47.214 --> 16:48.090
[Miranda] Yes, we…

16:48.173 --> 16:49.341
[Antoni] Were you in shock?

16:49.425 --> 16:50.676
-No.
-[laughs]

16:50.759 --> 16:54.221
Uncle Karamo gonna let you know,
fail, fail, fail.

16:54.304 --> 16:57.808
Fast-food restaurants
are not anniversary dates.

16:57.891 --> 17:01.687
What do you hope will be different
about your father or the situation?

17:01.770 --> 17:03.731
I think there's sometimes
a miscommunication

17:03.814 --> 17:07.109
between, like, what my mom needs
and, like, what he can give her, um,

17:07.192 --> 17:08.819
so I just hope, like, at the end,

17:08.902 --> 17:11.989
it could be, like, a reset
for their, like, relationship.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.366
And the outside
just needs a little bit of work.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.370
-[Tan] What are you talking about?
-Now he's no longer performing surgeries.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.372
-Yes.
-Let's get going.

17:20.456 --> 17:23.292
-Do I have to get my suitcase?
-No. No. You just coming with us.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.502
-Bye!
-Bye!

17:25.586 --> 17:26.670
[Ariel] Bye, Dad!

17:26.754 --> 17:29.465
They have their hands completely full.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.550
[Ernest] Oh, man, this is amazing.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.218
[upbeat music playing]

17:38.807 --> 17:41.769
I'm ready to figure out how we
can help Ernest show up in his marriage

17:41.852 --> 17:43.604
the way he shows up for his car,

17:43.687 --> 17:46.523
which is consistent, very lovingly,

17:46.607 --> 17:48.484
and with so much interest.

17:48.567 --> 17:53.572
If Ernest wants
to really woo Miranda after 39 years,

17:53.655 --> 17:55.824
he needs a little bit of refinement.

17:55.908 --> 17:56.950
He's a gentleman.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.328
I want him to look like a gentleman.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.623
This is an opportunity for him
to step out of his comfort zone a little

18:02.706 --> 18:04.708
and show up for his wife, Miranda,

18:04.792 --> 18:07.211
to think about the things
that make her excited.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.005
[Karamo] They spent their time
raising their daughters,

18:10.089 --> 18:11.215
and that was beautiful,

18:11.298 --> 18:13.342
but now the girls are grown
and out the house,

18:13.425 --> 18:17.221
and it's time for them to reconnect
and to get on the same page.

18:17.304 --> 18:21.433
Their bedroom, it's the farthest point
on the property from the garage.

18:21.517 --> 18:25.395
They have this great-sized home
that used to be filled with two kids,

18:25.479 --> 18:27.689
but now it's just the two of them,

18:27.773 --> 18:30.150
so I'm gonna move some things around.

18:31.693 --> 18:34.613
♪ My heart is so pumping ♪

18:34.696 --> 18:37.783
♪ Pumping harder than ever before ♪

18:37.866 --> 18:40.661
[Antoni] I love these trams
that you have in the city.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.955
So there are green ones
and red ones, right?

18:43.038 --> 18:43.914
[Ernest] Yeah.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.792
In the kitchen?

18:46.875 --> 18:48.210
In the kitchen!

18:48.293 --> 18:51.296
-We're gonna make a nice meal for Miranda.
-Okay. Okay.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.173
-By we, I mean you.
-Yeah, all right.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.551
-[Antoni] I'm gonna teach you.
-Our anniversary is Saturday.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.344
-Yes!
-Thirty-nine years.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.804
Thirty-nine years!

18:58.887 --> 19:00.013
[Ernest] Fantastic, man.

19:00.097 --> 19:04.518
For something like an anniversary,
it's, like, the pinnacle of romanticism.

19:04.601 --> 19:08.397
If there's one thing you need to know
about me, I'm a hopeless romantic,

19:08.480 --> 19:11.567
and nothing makes me
more excited than romance.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.026
So I want you to lean into that.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.321
But Miranda is more communicative.
See, I'm bad in English, man.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.741
You know, I just communicate
to just satisfy people, you know?

19:19.825 --> 19:21.243
Like, I do whatever I can.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.078
We all communicate in different ways.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.454
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-[Antoni] Yeah.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.206
-We're gonna figure it out.
-Yeah, okay.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.709
You're gonna make
the perfect meal for Miranda.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.127
When she's tasting the food,

19:30.210 --> 19:33.297
she's gonna know you were thinking
about her when you were making it.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.715
-Isn't that romantic?
-Yeah.

19:34.798 --> 19:35.883
-[Antoni] Are you down?
-Yes.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.009
[Antoni] Let's get started.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.345
We literally picked these
from your garden. These are yours.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.222
I'm gonna actually
put you to work right away.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.891
-Want me to clean 'em?
-[Antoni] You know.

19:43.974 --> 19:47.102
So we call this blanching,
when we throw the vegetable into the water

19:47.186 --> 19:48.937
so that it softens a little.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.272
-We're gonna take these…
-Shoop!

19:50.355 --> 19:51.190
Shoop!

19:51.273 --> 19:53.358
-So we're just gonna mix 'em around.
-[Ernest] Yes.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.485
Soften them up for about a minute or so.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.696
So Ernest definitely isn't a picky eater.

19:57.779 --> 20:01.700
I mean,
the man enjoys raccoon voluntarily.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.578
It's more about having him
lean into things

20:04.661 --> 20:06.830
that aren't just dishes that he likes.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.082
It's an opportunity
to think about his wife.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.459
Put 'em in the ice bath.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.295
-So that it stops it from cooking.
-[Ernest] Yeah.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.714
Look how they're still
really nice and beautiful and bright.

20:15.797 --> 20:18.634
-[Ernest] I never knew that.
-I got beautiful king salmon.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.719
It's really nice and lean
with the skin on.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.679
I know you're more accustomed
to grilling,

20:22.763 --> 20:25.015
but I'm gonna teach you
how to make it on a pan

20:25.098 --> 20:27.392
so the skin can be nice and crispy.
Are you down with that?

20:27.476 --> 20:29.686
-Yes.
-I'm actually gonna bring this over here.

20:29.770 --> 20:34.524
So olive oil in one pan
and then sesame oil for the snap beans.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.735
So these are gonna heat up pretty quickly.

20:36.818 --> 20:39.363
I'm gonna season the salmon very simply.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.240
-Just a little bit of salt.
-Okay.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.076
[Antoni] First thing I'm gonna put in
is our onions.

20:44.159 --> 20:47.704
We're gonna grab our peppers,
just for a little bit of sweetness.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.082
So I'm gonna ask you
to mix those around a little.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.126
Get you a towel
in case you need to use it.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.378
Yes, sir.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.880
So I'm gonna go ahead
and put these skin-side down.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.757
Pan needs to be nice and hot.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.885
If you put that fish on a cold pan,
the skin is gonna stick to it,

21:01.969 --> 21:03.303
and it's gonna fall apart.

21:03.387 --> 21:07.015
And then I'm gonna put in a bit of garlic
and a bit of ginger.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.102
[vocalizing]

21:10.185 --> 21:11.937
[Antoni] Now we can
mix everything together.

21:13.605 --> 21:14.439
Perfect.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.734
We can go ahead and put our soy in there,
our tamari soy.

21:17.818 --> 21:18.735
[Ernest] All of it?

21:18.819 --> 21:21.029
Yep. This is gonna be our salt component.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.448
I know that you have dishes that you make

21:23.532 --> 21:26.201
that are, like, very you
and where you come from.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.996
I just wanna make it clear,
I don't want to change any of that,

21:29.079 --> 21:30.998
but I think romance is, like,

21:31.081 --> 21:33.500
if I'm making food
and I'm thinking about my partner…

21:33.583 --> 21:34.418
Yeah.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.878
…and what he wants to have,
that's what makes it special.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.840
That's what I want Miranda to feel
when you're cooking for her.

21:39.923 --> 21:40.757
Oh yeah.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.677
You're gonna take this brush,
and we're just gonna lightly glaze it

21:43.760 --> 21:46.972
with this cumin, agave,
and tamarind glaze.

21:47.055 --> 21:47.889
[Ernest] Fantastic.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.559
[Antoni] This is gonna caramelize
and add a sweetness to it.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.647
Our last step here,
we have our herb situation.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.858
Know how to squeeze a lemon
so the seeds stay in?

21:57.941 --> 22:00.235
The seeds,
it don't make no difference to me.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.488
-I chew on them.
-Maybe it makes a difference to Miranda.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.116
I'm gonna squeeze it like this,
then the juice comes out,

22:06.199 --> 22:09.161
but the seeds, in theory, should stay in.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.204
Let's start out with a bit of beans.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.707
And then, salmon right on top.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.626
Put a little bit
of these herbs on top here.

22:16.710 --> 22:17.794
Put some herbs on yours.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.171
You're just dumping 'em on.

22:20.464 --> 22:21.631
So we have our plates.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.258
Hey, you got skin.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.885
You can have some. Here, take it.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.803
-My dad'll eat any skin.
-Same here.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.806
-Very good.
-What's better than crunchy salmon skin?

22:29.890 --> 22:30.807
Come with me.

22:31.558 --> 22:35.729
Hopefully I set up Ernest for success
so that no mistakes are made

22:35.812 --> 22:38.523
and so that he's ready
to blow Miranda's pants off.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.025
Not literally… but maybe.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.736
-How are the beans?
-Fresh.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.446
My favorite part is the salmon.

22:44.529 --> 22:47.949
So now your favorite fish
is also Miranda's favorite fish?

22:48.033 --> 22:48.867
No.

22:48.950 --> 22:52.829
I'll eat it, like, 'cause it's good,
but that's not my favorite fish. You know?

22:52.913 --> 22:55.207
Is this something you think
you'll be able to make?

22:55.290 --> 22:56.583
Oh yeah.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.668
-I want you in that kitchen.
-Oh man, yeah.

22:58.752 --> 23:03.131
I want you sautéing the beans,
patting dry the salmon,

23:03.215 --> 23:07.010
and she's, like,
"That's my husband of 39 years!"

23:07.094 --> 23:08.595
She'll get a big kick out of that.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.263
Tell me about the setting.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.973
You know, like, I could set up…

23:12.057 --> 23:14.351
-I got a piece of plywood.
-Yep.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.895
You know, put it on two buckets,
that's a table.

23:16.978 --> 23:20.315
Maybe a white tablecloth over that
just to make it a little more elegant.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.192
-Right.
-Where are you gonna enjoy this?

23:22.275 --> 23:23.402
Somewhere in between.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.363
Her kitchen is her place,
my man cave is my place,

23:26.446 --> 23:28.615
so it'd be in the middle,
for both of us.

23:28.698 --> 23:30.075
What do we call that?

23:30.158 --> 23:31.701
Compromise!

23:31.785 --> 23:33.370
-That's a good word.
-I love that.

23:33.453 --> 23:34.579
Fantastic.

this really cool gallery wall.

Thank you for joining me today.
You have no idea what we are doing.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.067
[Miranda] No, we don't,
but thank you for having us.

24:06.194 --> 24:08.155
[Karamo] What do you think
your lady would like?

24:08.238 --> 24:10.907
-I have no idea.
-39 years, you gotta have a little idea.

24:11.616 --> 24:14.911
It breaks my heart to hear
that Ernest knows his wife is unhappy,

24:14.995 --> 24:16.538
but he doesn't know what to do about it.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.957
-[Ernest] Look what I got for you.
-Well, thank you.

24:21.418 --> 24:25.547
Ariel, she said that she doesn't like
where your relationship is right now.

24:25.630 --> 24:26.590
Yeah.

24:27.299 --> 24:32.304
When we talked, I asked Ernest,
does he think you're happy?

24:33.221 --> 24:35.265
-And he said, "No."
-Right.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.684
[Karamo] Are you happy in your marriage?

24:38.477 --> 24:40.479
[emotional music playing]

24:43.857 --> 24:46.443
I don't feel seen or heard.

24:46.526 --> 24:47.861
Why don't you feel seen?

24:47.944 --> 24:51.239
Because I have made an effort

24:52.032 --> 24:57.287
to get you to see the importance
that I give to things.

24:57.370 --> 24:59.414
And when that stopped working,

24:59.498 --> 25:04.377
then I gave up on trying to appeal to you

25:04.461 --> 25:06.671
to see how it made me feel.

25:06.755 --> 25:07.631
Right.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.717
But, you see, like, for me, you know,

25:10.800 --> 25:14.221
like 90% of the things you ask me to do,
I always do.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.181
-[Miranda] You're ver--
-I'll take care of it.

25:16.264 --> 25:18.934
That's true. You're very task-oriented.

25:19.017 --> 25:19.935
Yes.

25:20.018 --> 25:23.647
Somehow, in relationships, we always get
to this place where we think doing this…

25:23.730 --> 25:25.148
[scoffs]

25:25.232 --> 25:27.484
…is better than actually leaning in.

25:27.567 --> 25:28.401
Yeah.

25:28.485 --> 25:31.279
When you give up trying,
you're giving up the relationship.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.406
And I don't think you wanna
give up that relationship.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.699
No. I don't.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.911
Well, what's… what's… what's the key?

25:37.994 --> 25:39.412
What's the answer?

25:39.496 --> 25:41.248
You ever heard
of the five love languages?

25:41.331 --> 25:45.252
So the five ways that we need
to feel loved in our relationships.

25:45.335 --> 25:48.088
So, for instance,
there's words of affirmation.

25:48.171 --> 25:51.800
So some people like to wake up
and be like, "Girl, you fine."

25:51.883 --> 25:53.760
There's also quality time,

25:53.843 --> 25:55.262
receiving gifts,

25:55.345 --> 25:56.471
physical touch,

25:56.555 --> 26:00.684
and then there's acts of service.
"You need that done? I'll do it for you."

26:00.767 --> 26:03.019
Is acts of service
the way you need to be loved?

26:03.103 --> 26:04.396
That's not it.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.690
[Karamo] So this entire time,

26:07.274 --> 26:09.568
you think, by doing this chore,

26:09.651 --> 26:12.904
that you're showing her,
"Look, I'm still here, baby. I'm trying."

26:12.988 --> 26:15.365
-Acts of service are great, Ernest.
-Yes.

26:15.448 --> 26:17.993
[Karamo] But Miranda is saying
she needs something else.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.035
Right.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.579
And what do you need?

26:20.662 --> 26:22.706
Quality time and a lot of touch.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.792
Do you feel
like you get quality time and touch?

26:25.875 --> 26:29.004
Uh, you know, recently,
no, it wasn't like that.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.257
Used to be.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.466
What do you need?

26:33.550 --> 26:36.052
I need quality time.

26:36.636 --> 26:39.723
I do need touch and affirmation.

26:40.223 --> 26:41.474
-Words.
-Well--

26:41.558 --> 26:43.977
I know the communication is difficult.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.438
The words, I'm not good with words.

26:46.521 --> 26:50.817
I just need you
to let me know that you need me,

26:51.401 --> 26:54.779
because your independence
is sometimes very lonely.

26:56.698 --> 27:00.827
And I do feel alone in our marriage.

27:07.042 --> 27:07.959
[sighs]

27:12.005 --> 27:14.633
[crying] You know, she's special to me.

27:17.677 --> 27:20.639
And I know, for sure,
I could get it back together.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.600
I know, 'cause we special.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.855
Can you say to your wife, "I need you?"

27:30.231 --> 27:31.358
I need you.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.155
I need you too.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.534
Now, on the flip side,
because a relationship is two,

27:42.369 --> 27:46.665
he said he needs
more quality time and touch.

27:46.748 --> 27:47.749
And you both said that.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.336
When was the last time you all held hands?

27:51.920 --> 27:55.382
-When I was in the hospital?
-I didn't even know you remembered that.

27:55.465 --> 27:57.926
-So this is where the actions come in.
-Right.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.762
-So I think holding hands is a nice start.
-Yeah.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.765
[chuckles]

28:03.848 --> 28:05.600
-You did it on the sly.
-[Ernest chuckles]

28:05.684 --> 28:07.102
Let me see them holding hands.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.145
Oh! You sly with it!

28:09.229 --> 28:12.065
I see the player in you now
and why you got such a pretty lady.

28:12.148 --> 28:13.525
[Ernest] Oh man.

28:13.608 --> 28:14.484
-Yeah.
-I do see it.

28:15.485 --> 28:18.530
This is something that's simple,
that even in your busy schedule,

28:18.613 --> 28:20.990
if you can say, "I need you,"

28:21.074 --> 28:25.161
and if you can also stop
and just hold hands for two minutes,

28:25.245 --> 28:26.663
it's gonna be the first steps

28:26.746 --> 28:30.125
into you communicating the same way
in your love languages,

28:30.208 --> 28:31.710
because what's going on right now

28:31.793 --> 28:34.462
is not two people
who really don't wanna be in this.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.340
It's two people
who just forgot how to be in this.

28:37.424 --> 28:38.550
Yes.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.385
[Karamo] Ernest is so willing.

28:40.468 --> 28:43.263
You can see that he loves his wife
and he wants to change,

28:43.346 --> 28:46.933
and that's the first step
in reconnecting with someone you love,

28:47.016 --> 28:48.643
that desire to be better.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.229
We were going through a box in your house,

28:52.147 --> 28:53.481
and I saw this.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.650
[laughing]

28:55.734 --> 28:56.901
[Karamo] Do you remember that?

28:56.985 --> 28:58.653
[Miranda] I do remember it, yes.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.280
But I want you to look at that.

29:00.363 --> 29:01.698
[Miranda] Mm-hmm.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.533
[Karamo] Look how close those two were.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.161
Those two people
knew they needed each other.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.121
Yeah, man, that's fantastic.

29:09.205 --> 29:10.707
I remember these people.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.042
[Karamo] They're not gone.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.254
[upbeat music playing]

29:18.131 --> 29:20.133
[yodeling]

29:28.850 --> 29:30.727
[Tan] Have you been to Rubensteins before?

29:30.810 --> 29:33.271
Yeah. I think twice in my lifetime.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.483
-After you.
-Thank you, sir.

29:40.403 --> 29:43.406
-When was the last time you came shopping?
-I couldn't remember.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.074
I think about 30 years.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.703
Like, 30 years
since you went into a store?

29:48.787 --> 29:52.081
Yes, 'cause my wife,
she would get anything for me.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.375
The end of this week,
it's your anniversary.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.170
You're putting together
something beautiful, right, Ernest?

29:57.253 --> 29:58.880
What do you think she wants?

29:58.963 --> 30:01.800
What she would like
is nice clothes for me to wear

30:01.883 --> 30:03.384
and go out with her, hang out with her.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.386
Have you ever considered blowing her mind?

30:05.470 --> 30:06.971
Not really.

30:07.055 --> 30:10.600
-You've had 39 years to do that.
-[chuckles]

30:10.683 --> 30:12.143
-You see where I'm going?
-Yeah. Yeah.

30:12.227 --> 30:14.521
Why have you not?
Be honest. I just wanna know.

30:14.604 --> 30:18.066
Because it's not in me.
You know, like, I'm more of a casual guy.

30:18.149 --> 30:20.318
-You have a wonderful woman.
-[Ernest] Yeah, fantastic.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.905
Who has stuck with you for a long time,
because you're clearly a wonderful man.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.907
However, I think she's just thinking,

30:25.990 --> 30:28.576
"After all this time,
I want my husband to be my husband."

30:28.660 --> 30:30.662
-[Ernest] Right.
-"Not the garage's husband."

30:30.745 --> 30:33.581
-Right, truly.
-Truly, like, real talk.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.625
I've been letting her down.
Really, I have.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.669
[Tan] So I wanna do something for you

30:37.752 --> 30:40.880
where it makes it really clear
to your wife you care.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.299
I know you don't wear
a lot of formal clothes.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.343
-You don't need to in the garage.
-Right.

30:45.426 --> 30:48.221
But, like, for a formal situation,
like a wedding reception.

30:48.304 --> 30:49.681
-Or an anniversary?
-[Ernest] Yeah.

30:49.764 --> 30:51.808
-[Tan] Maybe you need something for that.
-Yeah.

30:51.891 --> 30:55.687
[Tan] So anytime you wanna go for a suit,
but you don't wanna feel super fancy,

30:55.770 --> 30:59.399
I would suggest something deconstructed.
That means it hasn't got a lining.

30:59.482 --> 31:02.944
It's a little looser,
and so you don't feel so restricted.

31:03.027 --> 31:06.322
If you've got, let's say, for example,
a T-shirt and a pair of jeans on,

31:06.406 --> 31:08.116
and she wants to go out for dinner,

31:08.199 --> 31:10.368
just throw on a jacket,
and you're good to go.

31:10.451 --> 31:13.329
-You don't have to make a major effort.
-That'd definitely work.

31:13.413 --> 31:16.040
-[Ernest] Can I see these ones on, please?
-[Ernest] Yes.

31:16.666 --> 31:19.210
Love those. Leave them just here.
We'll pick them up later.

31:19.294 --> 31:22.297
You did say that you like your suspenders
'cause it's your thing.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.841
[Ernest] Yeah. I don't see a lot of people
that wears them.

31:24.924 --> 31:27.635
I love these versions.
I love that you wanna be unique,

31:27.719 --> 31:29.929
that you're considering
how you present yourself.

31:30.013 --> 31:32.056
What I don't wanna see again is zip ties.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.017
Zip ties started
before the suspenders.

31:34.100 --> 31:37.520
I'm sure they did,
and they needed to die a long time ago.

31:37.604 --> 31:38.438
[laughs]

31:38.521 --> 31:41.399
Don't wanna see zip ties
on your pants ever again.

31:41.482 --> 31:43.192
-Are you ready to try on?
-[Ernest] Yes.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.904
Whoo-hoo! All right, come on out.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.781
If you can just park yourself
right here for me.

31:49.657 --> 31:50.783
Bam, bam, bam.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.036
Mmm, mmm, mmm. Now,

31:54.078 --> 31:56.831
does that feel
a little bit more Ernest for you?

31:56.915 --> 31:57.749
Yes.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.834
It's fantastic, man.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.170
[Tan laughs]

32:02.253 --> 32:03.129
I love it.

32:03.212 --> 32:05.715
[Tan] You're just gonna walk around town
snapping those, are you?

32:05.798 --> 32:07.008
I love that he loves it.

32:07.091 --> 32:10.011
He clearly is feeling himself.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.721
I wouldn't be mad at this at all

32:11.804 --> 32:14.223
if you ended up wearing this
on a date with the lovely Miranda.

32:14.307 --> 32:19.729
However, you could start the date
looking extra swaggy.

32:21.689 --> 32:22.523
Fantastic.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.859
Tell me what makes it work for you.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.154
Well, it fits good,
and the material feels well.

32:28.237 --> 32:29.155
Real comfortable.

32:30.031 --> 32:33.576
[Tan] When was the last time
you saw yourself looking wonderful?

32:33.660 --> 32:34.786
Very long time.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.829
Is it nice seeing yourself this way again?

32:36.913 --> 32:37.747
Yes.

32:37.830 --> 32:41.709
What's the point of wasting it on scrubs
when you can look as good as this?

32:41.793 --> 32:43.503
-Ready to try something else?
-[Ernest] Yes.

32:47.256 --> 32:49.050
Ooh, I already love.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.301
Fantastic.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.220
Are you just being nice to me?

32:52.303 --> 32:53.930
-No.
-Last one, you said fantastic too.

32:54.013 --> 32:58.017
[Ernest] Well, this is more fantastic
than the other one, I think.

32:58.101 --> 33:00.603
-Tell me what you like about it.
-Well, it's camouflage.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.063
-Like I'm a hunter.
-[Tan] I know.

33:02.146 --> 33:05.692
This is more comfortable
and looks like it's more simple.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.443
You know, like, 'cause I'm simple.

33:07.527 --> 33:10.613
Could you actually see yourself
wearing things like this

33:10.697 --> 33:11.948
for hangouts with Miranda?

33:12.031 --> 33:15.618
Yes, and, you know,
I just know I'll blow her mind,

33:15.702 --> 33:18.788
'cause, you know, like,
it's… it's… it's blowing my mind,

33:18.871 --> 33:21.499
you know, like… Man.

33:23.042 --> 33:24.127
I… Oh.

33:24.210 --> 33:28.339
Everybody that knows me
is going, "Ernest?"

33:28.423 --> 33:29.841
-Yes.
-[laughs]

33:29.924 --> 33:31.801
[Ernest] And I know it. Yeah, man!

33:31.884 --> 33:34.053
[Tan laughs]

33:34.137 --> 33:37.557
Well, wait. I want you to try on
the glasses that I pulled for you earlier.

33:38.307 --> 33:44.439
I mean, Ernest, you look so darn good.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.774
Hopefully, you'll look
at your closet and think,

33:46.858 --> 33:49.902
"I wanna get dressed up.
I wanna make an effort for my wife."

33:49.986 --> 33:51.529
For sure. She deserves it.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.281
-[Tan] She deserves it.
-She does.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.324
-Can I give you a hug, Ernest?
-Sure, you can, man.

33:55.408 --> 33:57.285
Because I'm really, really happy.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.996
-And you're made me really, really proud.
-[Ernest] Yeah.

34:00.079 --> 34:03.374
The way you keep raising your eyebrows
at yourself in the mirror is amazing.

34:03.458 --> 34:04.417
[laughs]

34:04.500 --> 34:06.753
Watch out. Watch out.

34:06.836 --> 34:09.213
[swanky music playing]

34:11.382 --> 34:13.134
[Jonathan] Okay, we're here.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.762
Gorgeous Bluenote Barbershop.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.181
Go ahead, gorgeous.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.016
This is Invee.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.185
-How you doing, sir?
-[Jonathan] We love Invee so much.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.102
He's the best.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.730
-Ernest, can I take your hat off?
-Sure.

34:25.813 --> 34:28.274
He actually has
what we lovingly call a skullet.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.778
I don't know if it's because
I was your mom in a past life,

34:31.861 --> 34:35.615
I just think it's, like, so adorable,
this little curly hair right here,

34:35.698 --> 34:37.450
but his wife doesn't like it!

34:37.533 --> 34:39.577
Today is a story of, like, compromise

34:39.660 --> 34:43.664
and making sure that Miranda, your wife,

34:43.748 --> 34:47.126
still wants to hold your hand.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.044
[Ernest] Oh yeah.

34:48.127 --> 34:51.130
With your shirts off,
in a very respectful way.

34:51.214 --> 34:53.341
I don't think that's gonna make a diff--

34:53.424 --> 34:54.884
-[Jonathan] It does!
-It does?

34:54.967 --> 34:57.386
[Jonathan] It absolutely does.

34:57.470 --> 34:58.429
[laughs]

34:58.513 --> 35:01.432
-She said that she misses you.
-[Ernest] Yeah.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.684
And you guys live together!

35:03.768 --> 35:07.980
Yeah, but, you know, she's a cook,
watching the Cooking Channel.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.858
I'm in my man cave, watching sports.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.194
But what if you guys
just sat next to each other

35:13.277 --> 35:15.029
for, like, one TV show a week?

35:15.113 --> 35:17.573
Just as long as they don't have
any good sporting events on.

35:17.657 --> 35:20.159
My husband watches
figure skating and gymnastics with me

35:20.243 --> 35:21.494
even though he hates it.

35:21.577 --> 35:24.956
He's obsessed with gardening,
and I was like, "Ugh, gardening."

35:25.039 --> 35:26.916
-Like, "Kick me in the face."
-[laughs]

35:26.999 --> 35:29.669
Turns out there's this TV show
called Gardeners' World

35:29.752 --> 35:32.255
that I thought I hated,
but it's actually really cute,

35:32.338 --> 35:34.549
so maybe there might be
a cooking personality you like.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.259
But you'll never know if you don't try it.

35:36.342 --> 35:38.427
-Right.
-Can I take your bubble pony out?

35:38.511 --> 35:39.428
[Ernest] Yeah.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.097
I love how you style your beard.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.473
[Ernest] I got style, man.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.642
[Jonathan] You got such good style.

35:44.725 --> 35:45.726
You really do.

35:45.810 --> 35:48.396
It might be unique,
but it's one of a kind.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.772
[Jonathan] Here's the thing.

35:49.856 --> 35:53.484
If Ernest had his skullet and his beard
because he loved them,

35:53.568 --> 35:55.778
and that was his personal style…

35:58.114 --> 35:59.407
I would clap it out.

35:59.490 --> 36:02.243
So I think, like,
a nice little square thing on him

36:02.326 --> 36:03.286
could be really nice.

36:03.369 --> 36:05.121
But that's not how we've arrived here.

36:05.204 --> 36:08.457
We've actually arrived at this style
due to neglect.

36:09.208 --> 36:12.086
I'm gonna start by cutting his mullet off,
then we'll shape it.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.588
It's coming off, Ernest.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.591
Oh Lord.

Hello, jaw.

36:26.684 --> 36:29.604
I do love your big-ass mustache.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.149
Should we do
a little handlebar on him for fun?

36:33.232 --> 36:34.150
Yeah, for sure.

-[Ernest] She's just all around.

36:42.992 --> 36:46.078
You know, like, her mind,
you know, like, the way she thinks.

Mm-hmm.

36:54.128 --> 36:56.839
-She does have a pretty smile.
-Yeah.

36:56.923 --> 37:00.051
Because here's the thing.
Everyone wants to feel wanted and needed.

37:00.134 --> 37:01.469
-Right.
-By their partner.

37:01.552 --> 37:02.929
-[Ernest] Right.
-You included.

37:03.012 --> 37:06.265
So that means that you both
have to celebrate your partner more.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.558
-I will.
-[Jonathan] Yeah!

37:07.642 --> 37:10.186
You'll be able
to show up for Miranda better.

37:10.269 --> 37:11.604
-That makes sense, right?
-Yes.

37:11.687 --> 37:13.397
Yes. Yes. Yes.

37:13.481 --> 37:17.109
-This is a mustache wax that I like.
-[Ernest] Okay.

37:17.193 --> 37:19.070
I just took a little teeny tiny bit.

37:19.153 --> 37:21.822
Then you take your index finger,
set the hair on there,

37:21.906 --> 37:25.576
and I just like, push the wax on my finger
to, like, bend it upwards.

37:26.702 --> 37:28.496
And, my God, does he look gorgeous?

37:28.579 --> 37:31.374
Have we done such a good job,
or have we done such a good job?

-Look at him!
-[Invee] Right?

You are so cute.

37:34.168 --> 37:35.127

47:07.616 --> 47:10.369
[Antoni] I don't think I've ever wanted
to have a family more.

47:10.452 --> 47:12.996
I want that. I wanna look at a wall,
look at the photos,

47:13.080 --> 47:15.165
and see your entire life.

47:15.249 --> 47:17.292
[Ariel] We're ready. Open it!

47:19.461 --> 47:20.420
[Ernest chuckles]

47:21.171 --> 47:23.382
Oh wow!

47:30.097 --> 47:30.931
A door?

47:31.014 --> 47:32.558
[Ernest laughs]

47:32.641 --> 47:33.767
[laughs]

47:33.851 --> 47:35.602
You seen your closets.

47:35.686 --> 47:36.979
This is mine.

47:39.565 --> 47:41.942
Ernest, you have clothes!

47:42.818 --> 47:44.695
Are you gonna wear these?

47:44.778 --> 47:46.405
For sure! For sure!

47:46.488 --> 47:47.573
Oh.

47:49.324 --> 47:50.450
[Karamo] Yes!

47:50.534 --> 47:51.618
[Ernest] Ready?

47:51.702 --> 47:52.744
-[Miranda] Yes.
-Set…

47:54.997 --> 47:58.750
-[chuckles]
-Oh, guys!

47:58.834 --> 48:00.544
Look. [chuckles]

48:00.627 --> 48:03.130
Oh, guys!

48:03.213 --> 48:06.258
The week of growth was for him,
but this is all for her.

48:06.341 --> 48:08.719
Are you serious?

48:09.219 --> 48:11.889
-Oh my goodness!
-And look.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.893
[Antoni] The little butterflies!

48:15.976 --> 48:17.185
They have a home now.

48:21.940 --> 48:23.859
-Look at that one.
-[Ernest] Yeah, you love it.

48:23.942 --> 48:24.985
[Miranda chuckles]

48:27.112 --> 48:28.405
Aw.

48:28.488 --> 48:29.781
[Ariel] This is all for you.

48:29.865 --> 48:31.700
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

48:31.783 --> 48:33.285
[Ernest] Thanks a whole bunch, girl.

48:33.368 --> 48:34.995
[Ariel] Yeah, no, enjoy it.

48:35.078 --> 48:37.205
-I love you.
-[Ernest] I love you too, girl.

48:37.956 --> 48:40.918
-Mmm.
-[Miranda] Absolutely beautiful.

48:41.001 --> 48:43.503
I think we could spend
a lot of time out here.

48:43.587 --> 48:44.922
Enjoy the rest of your night.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.214
-We sure will.
-Thank you.

48:46.298 --> 48:47.758
-[Ariel] I love you guys.
-Thank you.

48:47.841 --> 48:48.884
We sure will.

48:48.967 --> 48:51.303
[Tan] I hope my kids
are as sweet as Ariel one day.

48:51.386 --> 48:52.763
-[Jonathan] So sweet!
-Yeah.

48:52.846 --> 48:54.306
[Ernest] All right.

48:54.389 --> 48:56.600
-Look at this.
-What are you cooking?

48:56.683 --> 48:58.352
Okay, so this is a big moment

48:58.435 --> 49:01.313
because, as we all know,
the kitchen is Miranda's turf.

49:01.396 --> 49:02.230
[Ernest] For you?

49:03.649 --> 49:04.733
[Miranda] Salmon!

49:04.816 --> 49:05.859
-Yes!
-[Ernest] Fantastic.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.027
[Bobby] Oh!

49:07.110 --> 49:08.987
Hey, a departure in protein for him.

49:11.782 --> 49:12.616
[Ernest] Oh yeah.

49:12.699 --> 49:14.201
Shake and bake.

49:14.826 --> 49:15.744
Good job.

49:15.827 --> 49:19.414
-[Miranda] Oh, that's from the garden.
-[Ernest] Yes. Fantastic.

49:21.208 --> 49:24.002
[Karamo] It seemed like a salmon dish
is pretty easy to cook.

49:24.086 --> 49:26.797
It's a lot quicker than raccoon stew,
I'll tell you that.

49:26.880 --> 49:29.216
-[Tan] He plated that up really nicely.
-He did.

49:31.134 --> 49:32.719
[Miranda] Delicious. Thank you.

49:32.803 --> 49:35.013
-[Ernest] I amaze myself.
-[chuckles]

49:35.097 --> 49:38.392
He decided to compromise
and make something that Miranda likes.

49:38.475 --> 49:40.477
-To us.
-To us.

49:41.395 --> 49:42.938
You really look good.

49:43.021 --> 49:45.357
You look like your old self.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.359
-My old self?
-But new self.

49:47.442 --> 49:48.610
-I'm back.
-New self.

49:48.694 --> 49:51.446
-[Ernest] Yes.
-Glad to meet you, Mr. Bartholomew.

49:51.530 --> 49:52.656
[Ernest] Good.

49:52.739 --> 49:53.991
[Miranda chuckles]

49:54.074 --> 49:55.784
[Ernest] I love you, girl.

49:55.867 --> 49:57.911
It will change.

49:59.454 --> 50:01.039
You wanna marry me?

50:01.123 --> 50:02.416
-Marry you again?
-[Ernest] Yes.

50:02.499 --> 50:03.375
[Miranda] Yes.

50:04.001 --> 50:04.960
[Miranda chuckles]

50:05.794 --> 50:07.129
Aw!

50:07.963 --> 50:08.964
[Karamo] Look at that.

50:09.047 --> 50:10.716
That's so lovely.

50:10.799 --> 50:12.718
[romantic piano music playing]

50:12.801 --> 50:14.136
[chuckles]

50:14.720 --> 50:16.805
Ernest looks good, he feels good,

50:16.888 --> 50:21.643
but he also finally understands
how Miranda needs him to show up for her.

50:21.727 --> 50:24.521
You can find somebody
who lets you be who you are,

50:24.604 --> 50:27.399
but, on the flip side,
figure out what makes them spark,

50:27.482 --> 50:29.693
what they're passionate about,
what they love.

51:18.658 --> 51:19.701
[Karamo] Voodoo.

51:19.785 --> 51:21.953
It's an often misunderstood practice.

51:22.037 --> 51:24.873
The religion was brought to Louisiana
by enslaved West Africans

51:24.956 --> 51:26.833
via the Caribbean Corridor.

51:26.917 --> 51:30.754
It's a religion connected
to nature, ancestors, and spirit.

51:30.837 --> 51:32.881
The core belief of New Orleans Voodoo

51:32.964 --> 51:37.094
is that one god doesn't interfere
in our daily lives, but the spirits do.

51:37.969 --> 51:39.513
Right, babies? [chuckles]

51:39.596 --> 51:41.181
Hi, Antoni.
