12:15.551 --> 12:19.295
It's my chance to fly you out
here to see me.

12:19.314 --> 12:22.723
Honestly, after the day
I had today, I mean,

12:22.817 --> 12:26.152
A weekend getaway sounds
amazing.

12:26.304 --> 12:29.138
Oh, no, it's something with
your ex again?

12:29.157 --> 12:31.824
Um, roger?

12:31.977 --> 12:33.159
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

12:33.311 --> 12:35.754
Let's talk about something
more exciting.

12:35.905 --> 12:39.406
Like, how am I going to come
all the way from rockport,

12:39.501 --> 12:43.336
Massachusetts to the beautiful
island of little inagua?

12:43.488 --> 12:46.264
Well, ashley, that's a...
That's a good question.

12:46.415 --> 12:49.659
My secretary will book you
a first class fare.

12:49.677 --> 12:52.419
A car will come and pick you up
to take you to the airport,

12:52.514 --> 12:55.832
And all you need to do
is pack.

12:55.850 --> 12:57.517
Let me spoil you.

12:57.669 --> 13:00.003
Okay. Sounds great!

13:00.096 --> 13:01.854
(giggling)

13:02.007 --> 13:04.841
(cell phone ringing)

13:04.859 --> 13:08.269
- Is something wrong?
- (marco sighing)

13:08.288 --> 13:10.530
Yeah, I gotta take this.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.181
Okay.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.109
Marco: Ashley, I have to go,
but I will see you so very soon.

13:15.203 --> 13:17.520
Yeah, sure, see you soon!

13:17.539 --> 13:18.630
(hitting key to end call)

13:21.951 --> 13:23.376

13:23.470 --> 13:24.719

13:46.326 --> 13:47.450
Marco?

13:48.978 --> 13:50.495
Ashley, hey.

13:50.646 --> 13:52.722
Hi, it's really late here.

13:52.815 --> 13:54.982
Sorry, is everything okay?

13:55.001 --> 13:57.669
Listen, I'm so sorry to call
you like this,

13:57.896 --> 14:00.654
But, um, seems like I've had
a bit of a setback.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.090
I was robbed tonight.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.251
Oh no!

14:05.345 --> 14:07.512
Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:07.663 --> 14:09.163
Are you all right?

14:09.257 --> 14:10.256
Marco:
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

14:10.408 --> 14:13.334
They didn't get into the safe,
but...

14:13.353 --> 14:15.428
They did steal my main hard
drive,

14:15.580 --> 14:17.763
Which my secretary informs
me has passwords

14:17.916 --> 14:19.248
To all my accounts.

14:19.342 --> 14:21.025
Oh my god.

14:21.177 --> 14:22.935
Marco: Now I'm gonna be on
the phone with the banks

14:23.088 --> 14:25.280
All weekend trying to access
these accounts.

14:28.610 --> 14:29.868
And I can't believe it,

14:30.019 --> 14:34.113
But it looks like I'll have
to delay our vacation.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.615
(sighing)

14:35.709 --> 14:38.710
That's awful.

14:38.861 --> 14:42.955
I mean, I wish it could still
work, it's just a few days.

14:43.108 --> 14:45.108
Port fees are due tomorrow.

14:45.126 --> 14:47.110
And I've been told that
even a slight delay

14:47.128 --> 14:49.946
In material shipments
and I'll be out of work.

14:50.039 --> 14:52.298
It's the cost of doing business
on an island.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.300
Yeah.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.644
So, do you want to reschedule?

14:58.565 --> 15:00.398
Ashley, this was my only
vacation window

15:00.549 --> 15:02.191
For weeks, or months.

15:03.978 --> 15:07.221
I was so looking forward to
seeing you.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.799
Yeah. Me too.

15:09.817 --> 15:12.802
But hey, we still have
our video calls, right?

15:12.895 --> 15:14.495
And we can try again in a few
months.

15:15.974 --> 15:17.657
Um...

15:17.809 --> 15:19.825
I mean, is there anything
I can do?

15:19.978 --> 15:22.161
What are these port fees?

15:22.313 --> 15:24.422
That's the irony, it's the-- the
money's not even the trifle,

15:24.649 --> 15:26.499
It's the timing
that's crucial.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.575
I see.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.345
So how much do you need
right now?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.431
$8,000.

15:33.582 --> 15:35.675
(exhaling)

15:35.827 --> 15:37.518
$8,000?

15:41.757 --> 15:43.441
I mean, um...

15:45.670 --> 15:47.445
If I loaned you some money,

15:47.672 --> 15:50.431
You think you can get it back
to me by, like, next week?

15:50.450 --> 15:51.841
Ashley, no. No.

15:51.859 --> 15:54.786
No. Thank you so much,
but I can't let you do that.

15:54.937 --> 15:56.454
Not even if it's for
a good reason.

15:56.681 --> 15:59.606
- I mean, I want to help.
- Ashley.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.793
- No.
- It's okay.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.869
It's fine, it's temporary,
right?

16:03.964 --> 16:06.613
And then we can sort it out
when I'm there.

16:06.708 --> 16:09.384
I mean, trust me, I could really
use a vacation right now.

16:11.362 --> 16:12.303
(sighing)

16:14.866 --> 16:17.976
Okay, but only-- only because I
want to see you so badly,

16:18.127 --> 16:20.627
And only because I know you'll
get that money back

16:20.647 --> 16:22.888
In no time, okay?

16:22.983 --> 16:24.465
Alright, I'm sending you
the account number.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.400
Okay.

16:27.061 --> 16:29.228

Thank you for trusting me,

41:37.053 --> 41:39.721
Why don't you come stay with me
for a few days?

41:39.814 --> 41:41.331
I really don't want
to stay alone,

41:41.558 --> 41:43.166
But I also don't want to impose
on you like that.

41:43.317 --> 41:44.742
I know how much you like
your space.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.561
Oh, okay, alright.

41:46.654 --> 41:48.588
I will make my chicken parm
sliders.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.491
Thanks, tess. I owe you.

41:52.585 --> 41:54.344
(cell phone chiming)

41:54.571 --> 41:56.012
What is it?

41:57.665 --> 41:58.831
Oh, great.

41:58.925 --> 42:01.518
Something is up at
the restaurant. It's grant.

42:01.669 --> 42:03.353
I gotta go. Come on.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.676
Grant?
Everything alright?

42:10.695 --> 42:12.862
I just got off the phone with
the police.

42:13.089 --> 42:15.114
- Jacqueline is on her way.
- Why?

42:23.433 --> 42:25.041
- (gasping)
- this is how I found it.

42:26.770 --> 42:28.044
Ashley, I'm so sorry.

42:29.455 --> 42:30.713
How could someone do this?

42:30.865 --> 42:32.940
They broke everything!

42:32.959 --> 42:35.960
If you were to start right away,
do you think maybe

42:36.112 --> 42:38.537
You could have this done before
the opening?

42:38.631 --> 42:40.782
'cause what I could do is
I could source the materials,

42:40.800 --> 42:43.208
I could ask favors for you,
if you need.

42:43.303 --> 42:44.227
Ashley:
I-I mean...

42:46.064 --> 42:49.957
Replacing the materials alone
could take... Weeks,

42:50.051 --> 42:51.809
And then having to redo
all this.

42:51.903 --> 42:54.478
Yeah.

42:54.573 --> 42:56.798
Wait, was this the only damage
that was done, nothing else?

42:56.891 --> 42:58.800
No, they, uh, they got
my tool bag,

42:58.818 --> 43:01.411
Which is like, about three grand
worth of gear.

43:01.562 --> 43:02.728
Oh, I'm sorry.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.972
But I didn't see anything else.
Just, um...

43:04.991 --> 43:07.399
I mean, nothing like this.

43:07.493 --> 43:10.086
You know what? They didn't even
check the cash register.

43:11.664 --> 43:13.089
I think this was personal.

43:15.985 --> 43:17.501
Roger.

43:17.654 --> 43:19.821
- It has to be.
- Wait...

43:19.839 --> 43:21.672
You think your ex would do
something like this?

43:21.766 --> 43:24.342
- You think he's this petty?
- I don't know!

43:24.436 --> 43:26.494
I mean, it's something I'm gonna
have to ask him myself.

43:26.512 --> 43:28.271
This is... This is insane.

43:31.517 --> 43:33.776
It's okay, you don't have to do
that, I'll take care of this.

43:34.003 --> 43:35.260
- It's fine.
- Jacqueline: I'm here!

43:35.355 --> 43:36.446
Show me the damage.

43:38.675 --> 43:40.842
Oh my god, it's true.

43:40.935 --> 43:42.619
- Was anybody hurt?
- No.

43:44.514 --> 43:45.863
- What did they take?
- Well, apparently

43:45.957 --> 43:48.941
They took grant's tools, but the
cash register wasn't touched

43:48.960 --> 43:52.536
And nothing else was stolen.
Just...

43:52.689 --> 43:54.797
Oh, this beautiful work.

43:55.024 --> 43:56.782
Ruined.

43:56.801 --> 44:00.044
Oh, that is such a violation.

44:00.138 --> 44:03.364
I think I can still make this
work if I could just

44:03.457 --> 44:06.476
Have a little more time,
I can fix this.

44:06.627 --> 44:08.645
You really think you can
fix this?

44:08.796 --> 44:11.130
Yes, if you could just
give me...

44:11.149 --> 44:14.542
- Just another two weeks or so.
- Another two weeks?

44:14.560 --> 44:16.819
- I needed this ready by Friday.
- I know.

44:17.046 --> 44:19.563
I have my reputation
on the line.

44:19.716 --> 44:20.731
I have made commitments.

44:20.884 --> 44:22.233
I...

44:22.327 --> 44:25.477
No, I'm sorry, ashley.

44:25.497 --> 44:28.981
You know I'm a fan, but I cannot
simply leave a wall bare.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.576
We'll just have to get a print
instead.

44:32.729 --> 44:35.487
- Jacqueline...
- Maybe a watercolor...

44:35.581 --> 44:37.565
Laminate, or something.

44:37.583 --> 44:40.343
Your services will no longer
be needed.

who could it be?

48:38.232 --> 48:40.141

No, ashley, no.
That guy is long gone.

out in a basement somewhere

- What?!

49:13.952 --> 49:16.177
She was already looking for

- Ashley: Are you okay?
- Roger: I'm fine.

54:14.735 --> 54:16.326
I've been hurt worse than this
roller blading.

54:16.479 --> 54:18.587
You don't look fine.

54:18.739 --> 54:22.165
Did the hospital prescribe
anything to you for the--

54:22.260 --> 54:24.151
You know what, actually,
what about an ice pack?

54:24.169 --> 54:26.077
You need an ice pack right there
for the swelling.

54:26.171 --> 54:27.412
- (groaning)
- sorry, sorry.

54:27.431 --> 54:30.582
I'm okay. Look, ashley,
I owe you an apology.

54:30.601 --> 54:32.751
Now that's the concussion
talking.

54:32.770 --> 54:35.162
Ash, I need you to listen to me,
okay?

54:35.180 --> 54:38.274
- Really listen.
- Okay.

54:38.425 --> 54:40.925
I had a lot of time to think
last night at the hospital

54:40.945 --> 54:43.337
Just lying there.

54:43.355 --> 54:46.523
I'm ashamed of the way I acted
with you.

54:46.617 --> 54:49.176
Fighting you,
getting the courts involved.

54:49.194 --> 54:51.453
It's the opposite
of what you are to me.

54:53.182 --> 54:54.123
I'm not your enemy.

54:56.276 --> 54:58.685
I don't want you to worry about
all that anymore, okay?

54:58.779 --> 55:01.446
You can keep the company name.

55:01.465 --> 55:05.301
It was yours to begin with,
anyway.

55:05.452 --> 55:08.620
That means a lot, roger.
Thank you.

55:08.639 --> 55:09.972
You're welcome.

55:11.700 --> 55:13.383
So, did you see who did this?

55:13.477 --> 55:15.144
Sure I saw who did this.

55:15.295 --> 55:16.979
Not that I knew him,
or anything.

55:17.206 --> 55:20.316
- But he sure knew you.
- Knew me?

55:20.467 --> 55:22.151
He was acting crazy,

55:22.302 --> 55:24.044
He was asking me all these
questions about you.

55:24.137 --> 55:26.322
He said to tell you,
"marco is coming."

55:32.404 --> 55:33.495
Oh.

55:34.999 --> 55:36.165
Now she knows.

55:37.484 --> 55:39.242
What do you want, you psycho?

55:39.395 --> 55:41.411
Like there aren't enough
podcasts out there?

55:41.505 --> 55:44.231
- You and ashley are close?
- Like sisters.

55:44.249 --> 55:46.733
What do you want?

55:46.752 --> 55:48.993
I just want my life back.

55:49.088 --> 55:50.495
I want my livelihood back.

55:50.589 --> 55:52.014
I want my reputation back.

55:54.668 --> 55:56.668
I wouldn't mind being able to
hold my head high

55:56.762 --> 55:58.929
In my hometown.

55:59.023 --> 56:01.081
Can you give that to me?

56:01.100 --> 56:02.858
Did you have any of that
to begin with?

56:05.421 --> 56:06.695
You know, they say a man's
reputation

56:06.922 --> 56:10.107
Is the most important thing
he has.

56:10.201 --> 56:12.759
More important than his words,
his deeds, it outshines us,

56:12.778 --> 56:14.536
It lives on after he dies.

56:31.780 --> 56:33.806
I know this woman.
This is dorothy.

56:37.377 --> 56:38.969
Why do you have this photo?

56:39.063 --> 56:40.145
Book club.

56:41.473 --> 56:42.398
(chuckling)

56:42.549 --> 56:44.474
You were plotting against me,
too?

56:44.627 --> 56:46.143
Hmm?

56:46.295 --> 56:48.478
You were trying to destroy me?

56:48.631 --> 56:49.571
You were trying to--

56:53.318 --> 56:56.561
You know, they say a woman's
reputation is her inner beauty.

56:56.580 --> 56:59.230
God, could be anymore sexist?
What are you gonna do,

56:59.324 --> 57:00.916
Spank me with a briefcase and--

57:01.143 --> 57:02.659
(yelping)

57:02.811 --> 57:04.494
I could destroy your reputation
the same way

57:04.647 --> 57:06.088
You and ashley did mine.

57:07.741 --> 57:09.758
(chuckling nervously)
oh my god.

57:09.985 --> 57:12.577
All that time lying to her,
spying on her.

57:12.596 --> 57:14.412
You're obsessed.

57:14.432 --> 57:16.173
She's gotten under your skin,
so...

57:16.325 --> 57:17.516
You should probably shut up now.

57:22.831 --> 57:23.939
Okay.

57:25.501 --> 57:27.350
Here's what we're gonna do.

57:27.445 --> 57:28.527
(sighing)

57:32.432 --> 57:33.449
Read that.

57:40.458 --> 57:42.532
"my name is tess parks,
I've known ashley--"

57:42.685 --> 57:43.959
Smile.

57:45.521 --> 57:46.962
Smile!

57:49.858 --> 57:53.135
"my name is tess parks,

57:53.286 --> 57:55.971
"I've known ashley morris
for a very long time.

57:57.716 --> 58:01.368
"she is a ruthless liar and
master manipulator

58:01.386 --> 58:05.147
"out to ruin the life
of every man she meets."

58:06.709 --> 58:08.375
Okay.

58:08.468 --> 58:11.228
Now what we're going to do

58:11.322 --> 58:13.638
Is make a little video

58:13.657 --> 58:16.492
Where you are going to say that,

58:16.643 --> 58:20.387
And you're going to tell the
whole world the truth

58:20.405 --> 58:23.499
About the real ashley morris,
your best friend.

58:33.085 --> 58:34.918
- (door creaking open)
- ashley: Tess?

58:35.012 --> 58:36.327
You home?

58:36.347 --> 58:37.495
(water running)

58:37.515 --> 58:38.680
Tess?

58:40.017 --> 58:41.683
(water running)

58:53.088 --> 58:54.196
Ow.

59:12.699 --> 59:14.365
Tess, I'm standing in
your kitchen

59:14.459 --> 59:15.792
Wondering where the hell
you are.

59:15.944 --> 59:17.386
Call me back, please.

59:21.617 --> 59:22.558
(sighing)

59:30.216 --> 59:32.976
(cell phone ringing)

59:33.128 --> 59:34.978
Finally, I've been calling you
all morning.

59:35.072 --> 59:36.646
Where are you?

59:36.740 --> 59:37.906
Marco:
Ashley.

59:45.140 --> 59:47.732
- Where is tess?
- (marco chuckling)

59:47.826 --> 59:49.418
You think you could attack me
and I wouldn't defend myself?

59:53.424 --> 59:55.498
What is this, revenge?

59:55.651 --> 59:57.426
Is that why you're here?

59:57.653 --> 59:59.177
This has nothing to do with
revenge.

1:00:00.246 --> 1:00:01.988
Then what do you want, marco?

1:00:02.082 --> 1:00:04.324
I want my reputation back!

1:00:04.343 --> 1:00:07.102
I want you to publicly retract
all the lies you told about me.

1:00:07.329 --> 1:00:09.420
I want everyone
to hear you confess.

1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:12.090
Reputation? How?

1:00:12.109 --> 1:00:14.592
I can't, it's long gone.
I mean,

1:00:14.612 --> 1:00:17.279
You can't put an explosion back
in the bomb, marco.

1:00:18.782 --> 1:00:20.449
So there's no way to
convince you?

1:00:24.029 --> 1:00:27.789
(muffled yelping)

1:00:29.609 --> 1:00:31.710
- How about now?
- (phone chiming)

1:00:35.799 --> 1:00:37.115
Oh my god, tess!

1:00:37.209 --> 1:00:38.783
No, no, no, no! Please!

1:00:38.802 --> 1:00:41.136
What are you doing?
Let her go, marco!

1:00:41.287 --> 1:00:44.197
She goes free the moment that
you admit publicly

1:00:44.216 --> 1:00:46.032
That you lied about me.

1:00:46.051 --> 1:00:47.458
(whimpering)

1:00:47.478 --> 1:00:50.294
I can't! How would I do that?
I mean, it's not just me!

1:00:50.314 --> 1:00:53.039
What do you want me to do, like,
I'm not the only one

1:00:53.058 --> 1:00:54.966
Telling my story. There are
hundreds of us out there.

1:00:55.060 --> 1:00:56.393
Do you realize that?

1:00:56.545 --> 1:00:59.637
Please let her go, please.
She's done nothing to you.

1:00:59.657 --> 1:01:01.564
Marco: She helped destroy
my reputation!

1:01:01.659 --> 1:01:04.326
She's done nothing?
She couldn't do anymore!

1:01:06.664 --> 1:01:08.479
Ashley: I don't know what you
want from me, seriously.

1:01:08.573 --> 1:01:10.907
I don't...
(whimpering)

1:01:11.001 --> 1:01:13.651
Look, um,

1:01:13.671 --> 1:01:15.170
I'll do what you want, okay?
I'll...

1:01:15.397 --> 1:01:17.898
Just please don't hurt her,
okay?

1:01:17.916 --> 1:01:20.583
Um, you want-- you want public
attention, that's what you want?

1:01:20.678 --> 1:01:22.085
I'll do it, okay?

1:01:22.237 --> 1:01:25.329
Um, maybe we can...

1:01:25.424 --> 1:01:29.518
We can go somewhere together in
public for everyone to see.

1:01:31.079 --> 1:01:32.187
What are you talking about?

1:01:32.338 --> 1:01:35.691
Look, um,
the restaurant, okay?

1:01:35.842 --> 1:01:38.601
They're having a grand opening
tomorrow night.

1:01:38.754 --> 1:01:41.179
Okay, and we can go there
together,

1:01:41.273 --> 1:01:43.532
Like a real date, okay?

1:01:43.683 --> 1:01:45.183
And everyone will see
us together

1:01:45.202 --> 1:01:46.927
And see what a gentleman
you are,

1:01:46.945 --> 1:01:48.945
And that's what you want, right?
That's what...?

1:01:49.039 --> 1:01:50.038
That's what...

1:01:54.211 --> 1:01:55.693
No, you're trying to trick me.

1:01:55.787 --> 1:01:58.788
You think that
I'm just some...

1:01:58.882 --> 1:02:01.958
...Stupid little boy asking you
out for pie.

1:02:02.110 --> 1:02:03.944
No, I'm not a fool, ashley.

1:02:03.962 --> 1:02:04.961
(whimpering)

1:02:05.055 --> 1:02:07.705
I swear, I will do it.
Please, I will.

1:02:07.799 --> 1:02:10.726
I'm not lying, just promise me
you'll let her go, please.

1:02:15.733 --> 1:02:17.065
Marco?

1:02:21.296 --> 1:02:22.571
Marco?

1:02:24.074 --> 1:02:25.407
Are you there?

1:02:28.637 --> 1:02:29.986
Okay, okay.

1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:32.063
We'll do it your way.

1:02:32.082 --> 1:02:34.641
But if I see even one cop there,
just one,

1:02:34.659 --> 1:02:36.585
You will never see your friend
again.

1:02:39.757 --> 1:02:42.591
So, how's tomorrow night at
eight o'clock?

1:02:42.742 --> 1:02:44.843
Yeah, yeah, tomorrow night.
Eight o'clock, yeah.

1:02:50.934 --> 1:02:53.602
(sobbing)

1:02:55.773 --> 1:02:57.689
- Grant?
- Hey.

1:02:59.109 --> 1:03:01.851
Are you okay?

1:03:02.004 --> 1:03:03.670
- No.
- Come here.

1:03:03.763 --> 1:03:05.688
No, I don't know what to do.

1:03:05.841 --> 1:03:07.265
I don't know what to do.

1:03:07.284 --> 1:03:08.784
- (crying)
- it's all right.

1:03:08.935 --> 1:03:10.452
It's okay. It's okay.

1:03:10.679 --> 1:03:13.013
Talk to me.

1:03:13.031 --> 1:03:14.790
I know who's behind all
the break-ins.

1:03:15.017 --> 1:03:16.699
He's been stalking me,
the guy I told you, marco,

1:03:16.794 --> 1:03:17.700
The one I met online.

1:03:17.795 --> 1:03:19.352
- It's him!
- Right.

1:03:19.371 --> 1:03:22.188
And he's the one who attacked
roger, and now he has tess!

1:03:22.207 --> 1:03:23.857
(stammers) w-what do you mean he
has tess?

1:03:23.950 --> 1:03:25.783
He just-- he took her!
He just took her.

1:03:25.803 --> 1:03:27.118
He took her somewhere,
I don't know--

1:03:27.137 --> 1:03:29.120
- I don't know where.
- Did you call the police?

1:03:29.139 --> 1:03:31.714
No, I can't, I mean, he said
he'd hurt her if I do.

1:03:31.867 --> 1:03:33.383
I don't know what to do.

1:03:33.477 --> 1:03:37.220
He told me if I do anything,
he'll hurt her,

1:03:37.372 --> 1:03:39.147
So I don't know if I should
call the cops,

1:03:39.299 --> 1:03:40.557
I don't know if that's...
(sniffing)

1:03:40.709 --> 1:03:42.892
This is all my fault.
I shouldn't have done this.

1:03:43.045 --> 1:03:44.319
I shouldn't have gone after him
like that,

1:03:44.546 --> 1:03:46.822
As if revenge was going to make
me feel better.

1:03:47.049 --> 1:03:48.715
No, no, no,
it wasn't about revenge.

1:03:48.808 --> 1:03:50.308
It was about justice, right?

1:03:50.327 --> 1:03:53.053
We can't let people
do this to us,

1:03:53.071 --> 1:03:56.665
Use our trust against us
like that, right?

1:03:56.892 --> 1:03:58.725
Yeah, but...

1:03:58.743 --> 1:04:00.894
I mean, what have I done?

1:04:00.987 --> 1:04:02.245
I don't know what to do now.

1:04:02.339 --> 1:04:04.747
Like, it's just...

1:04:04.842 --> 1:04:07.917
It's like, one thing after
another, you know?

1:04:08.070 --> 1:04:10.828
It all started the night
we went out for pie,

1:04:10.922 --> 1:04:13.098
And it's... It's, um...

1:04:15.410 --> 1:04:17.102
- That's the night--
- what?

1:04:21.007 --> 1:04:22.765
The night we went out
for our pie.

1:04:22.918 --> 1:04:23.859
Mm-hmm.

1:04:27.939 --> 1:04:29.447
- He...
- Ashley?

Let's, uh,
let's play some music, yeah?

1:05:03.233 --> 1:05:06.292
- Just to lighten the mood.
- Sure.

1:05:06.386 --> 1:05:09.237
I'm just really depressed.

1:06:08.298 --> 1:06:09.447
Yeah.

1:06:09.466 --> 1:06:12.542
Like old dried leather
in the desert sun.

1:06:12.694 --> 1:06:14.452
Was this your plan all along?

1:06:14.471 --> 1:06:17.389
Oh, no. No, this was all
improvised.

1:06:19.643 --> 1:06:22.385
It's like that japanese
pottery art.

1:06:22.537 --> 1:06:24.387
Kisumi, I believe it's called.

1:06:24.481 --> 1:06:25.722
Kintsugi.

1:06:25.874 --> 1:06:26.889
Jacqueline:
That's the one.

1:06:26.984 --> 1:06:28.041
Yeah.

1:06:28.134 --> 1:06:30.318
Oh, I only wish
it wasn't too late.

1:06:30.470 --> 1:06:32.487
I've already cancelled
the reservations.

1:06:32.714 --> 1:06:34.731
The reopening has been
postponed,

1:06:34.883 --> 1:06:37.383
I've resigned myself to
sucking up the loss.

1:06:37.402 --> 1:06:38.660
Well...

1:06:38.811 --> 1:06:41.645
Actually, um,

1:06:41.665 --> 1:06:45.558
Grant and I might have an idea
how you can fill this place,

1:06:45.651 --> 1:06:48.061
If you're willing to open
tomorrow night

1:06:48.079 --> 1:06:51.506
From a private, one-time
seating.

1:06:51.657 --> 1:06:54.175
Look, jacqueline,
I'm not the one who broke into

1:06:54.402 --> 1:06:57.345
Your restaurant and violated
your pride and joy,

1:06:57.572 --> 1:06:59.589
But if you help me,

1:06:59.683 --> 1:07:02.742
If you give me a chance
to set this straight,

1:07:02.761 --> 1:07:06.079
I can deliver you
the son of a bitch who did.

1:07:06.097 --> 1:07:11.985
♪

1:07:14.364 --> 1:07:15.864
I never had any doubt.

1:07:21.096 --> 1:07:22.120

1:07:38.538 --> 1:07:40.630
Ashley, ashley,
I am begging you,

1:07:40.782 --> 1:07:41.872
You can't go through with this.

1:07:41.892 --> 1:07:43.874
You don't know what this guy
is capable of.

1:07:43.894 --> 1:07:45.468
Yes, you're still gonna be
in public,

1:07:45.620 --> 1:07:47.303
But you're still gonna be alone.

1:07:47.455 --> 1:07:49.305
Not if you're there with me.

1:07:49.457 --> 1:07:51.624
I... I can't, I won't.

1:07:51.643 --> 1:07:54.644
I just, I can't watch you put
yourself in danger like this.

1:07:54.796 --> 1:07:56.479
You need to call the police.

1:07:56.631 --> 1:07:58.648
Ashley: But then what's going
to happen to tess?

1:07:58.742 --> 1:08:02.151
I mean, how could I live with
myself if she gets hurt?

1:08:02.245 --> 1:08:03.486
I'm sorry, grant.

1:08:03.638 --> 1:08:05.229
I've made up my mind, okay?

1:08:05.323 --> 1:08:06.915
I'm doing this,
with or without you.

1:08:07.976 --> 1:08:09.142
Well, I'm sorry, ashley.

1:08:09.235 --> 1:08:11.252
It's gonna have to be
without me, then.

1:08:12.497 --> 1:08:13.663
I'm done.

1:08:13.815 --> 1:08:15.331
- Goodbye.
- Grant!

1:08:15.483 --> 1:08:16.424
Grant!

1:08:17.743 --> 1:08:20.595
Poor bitter ashley.

1:08:20.746 --> 1:08:22.263
Always being let down.

1:08:24.659 --> 1:08:27.602
Well, I'll show her
what a real man looks like.

1:08:32.517 --> 1:08:33.608
(door slamming)

1:08:41.785 --> 1:08:44.119
Good evening, welcome.

1:08:44.270 --> 1:08:45.537
Your table is waiting.

1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:49.440
Hello, good evening.

1:08:49.459 --> 1:08:50.917
Thank you for coming.

1:08:52.537 --> 1:08:54.420
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:08:57.467 --> 1:08:59.300
Hello, welcome.
Thanks for coming.

1:09:00.528 --> 1:09:01.636
(cell phone chiming)

1:09:04.307 --> 1:09:06.432
Good evening,
we have you right over here.

♪

1:09:19.656 --> 1:09:21.156
Ashley.

- Hi.
- In person, finally.

1:09:25.570 --> 1:09:28.121
Wow, you look incredible.

1:09:29.315 --> 1:09:30.415
Thank you.

1:09:41.586 --> 1:09:44.587
Well, I'm here,

1:09:44.681 --> 1:09:46.255
In public,

1:09:46.408 --> 1:09:49.017
With you, for everyone to see.

1:09:49.244 --> 1:09:51.093
So... Where's tess?

1:09:51.246 --> 1:09:52.604
She's okay.

1:09:54.933 --> 1:09:56.840
For now. The rest is up to you.

1:09:56.935 --> 1:09:58.342
If you hurt her--

Don't be so pessimistic here.

1:10:00.438 --> 1:10:02.346
Just give me your hand.

1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:04.365
- What?
- I said give me your hand.

1:10:11.282 --> 1:10:12.498
Was that so hard?

1:10:13.935 --> 1:10:15.501
You smell like cheap motel soap.

1:10:22.368 --> 1:10:24.052
You're hurting me.

1:10:34.639 --> 1:10:35.730

Hey, fine. Whatever.

- Just...
- (liquid pouring)

Pretend like you're
having fun.

1:10:58.663 --> 1:10:59.754
To you.

1:11:01.407 --> 1:11:05.242
- To me?
- Yeah.

1:11:05.262 --> 1:11:06.744
(glasses clinking)

1:11:06.763 --> 1:11:09.822
For showing me how naive I was

About how the world works.

1:11:14.938 --> 1:11:17.830
- I showed you that?
- Yes, you did.

1:11:17.849 --> 1:11:19.691
And so much more.

1:11:22.687 --> 1:11:26.522
She is a ruthless liar and
master manipulator,

1:11:26.674 --> 1:11:31.193
Out to ruin the life of every
man she meets.

1:11:31.288 --> 1:11:33.955
My name is tess parks.

1:11:34.106 --> 1:11:37.292

- How did you find me?
- Ashley did.

1:11:48.713 --> 1:11:50.530
With some help.

1:11:50.548 --> 1:11:52.365
(groaning)

- You all right?
- Yeah.

1:11:53.626 --> 1:11:54.700
Yeah, is she okay?

1:11:54.794 --> 1:11:57.036
Yeah, she's fine. She's fine.

1:11:57.055 --> 1:11:58.813
I'll tell you more on the way.
Come on!

1:12:06.047 --> 1:12:08.823
(soft jazz playing)

1:12:11.069 --> 1:12:12.827
You don't like your wine?

Trying to keep my mind clear.

1:12:17.725 --> 1:12:19.559
Hmm.

1:12:19.652 --> 1:12:22.486
You haven't been on many dates,
have you, marco?

1:12:22.505 --> 1:12:23.821
Well, I mean,

1:12:23.915 --> 1:12:26.490
I seduce women for a living,
ashley.

1:12:26.509 --> 1:12:28.901
"seduce." sure.

1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:31.754
I mean, any idiot can
seduce someone.

1:12:31.848 --> 1:12:35.741
You just need to be shameless
enough to lie

1:12:35.835 --> 1:12:37.927
And tell people what they
want to hear.

1:12:38.021 --> 1:12:39.503
A pathetic grift.

1:12:39.522 --> 1:12:43.082
I mean, it's not like you're
earning a person's respect,

1:12:43.101 --> 1:12:45.585
Or having someone
fall in love with you

1:12:45.603 --> 1:12:47.269
Or call you their friend.

1:12:47.422 --> 1:12:50.940
You know, it requires empathy
and honesty

1:12:51.092 --> 1:12:52.867
To build a rapport.

1:12:53.018 --> 1:12:56.612
But unfortunately you're way too
scarred and too stunted

1:12:56.706 --> 1:12:58.764
To make that connection.

1:12:58.783 --> 1:13:00.524
Hmm.

1:13:00.543 --> 1:13:02.126
Well, you would know.

1:13:06.124 --> 1:13:08.674
Years of therapy trying to fix
that broken marriage.

1:13:09.869 --> 1:13:11.777
The pills, the depression.

1:13:11.871 --> 1:13:14.722
Blaming everybody around you.

1:13:14.874 --> 1:13:18.041
Never taking the time to really
look inwards,

1:13:18.136 --> 1:13:19.785
At the real problem.

1:13:19.879 --> 1:13:22.397
I know you spoke to roger.

1:13:22.548 --> 1:13:25.066
- I'm sure he told you plenty.
- Yeah, he did.

1:13:25.293 --> 1:13:27.217
He told me the divorce really
took a toll on you

1:13:27.311 --> 1:13:28.886
At the end there.

1:13:28.980 --> 1:13:30.571
You lost the car,
you lost the house,

1:13:30.798 --> 1:13:32.982
You lost every one of your
friends, except for one.

1:13:33.076 --> 1:13:34.650
Tess says hi by the way.

1:13:34.802 --> 1:13:35.985
Go to hell, you creep.

1:13:36.079 --> 1:13:37.578
Keep your voice down.

1:13:40.825 --> 1:13:42.825
It scares you, doesn't it?

1:13:42.977 --> 1:13:44.994
People staring at you.

1:13:45.146 --> 1:13:47.380
- Laughing at you.
- Shut up.

1:13:49.333 --> 1:13:52.668
You know what, you think you
can intimidate me?

1:13:52.820 --> 1:13:56.931
I know everything about you?

1:13:57.082 --> 1:14:00.935
All of your flaws.

1:14:01.162 --> 1:14:03.187
You don't even know
my first name.

1:14:07.001 --> 1:14:08.684
Oh, yeah?

1:14:08.836 --> 1:14:11.020
But I do know your first name.

1:14:11.114 --> 1:14:12.363
Nicholas.

1:14:16.344 --> 1:14:17.193
How?

1:14:17.345 --> 1:14:20.196
Maybe I've done
some digging too.

1:14:20.290 --> 1:14:22.198
Nicholas boczek.

1:14:22.292 --> 1:14:25.701
Born January 23rd, 1982,

1:14:25.853 --> 1:14:27.778
In a town called red bank
in new jersey--

1:14:27.797 --> 1:14:30.089
- (cutlery clanging)
- shut up!

1:14:33.303 --> 1:14:34.802
(whispering)
I'll kill you.

1:14:37.974 --> 1:14:39.056
You'll kill me?

1:14:40.810 --> 1:14:41.934
Okay.

1:14:44.814 --> 1:14:46.606
Are you going to kill us all?

1:14:54.065 --> 1:14:55.907
And what is this?

1:14:58.477 --> 1:15:01.996
This is your legacy, nicholas.

1:15:02.223 --> 1:15:04.390
All your conquests.

1:15:04.483 --> 1:15:06.892
Here to meet the real you!

1:15:06.911 --> 1:15:09.003
Well, the ones who were able
to make it here

1:15:09.230 --> 1:15:11.339
On such short notice,
of course.

1:15:11.490 --> 1:15:15.009
The many, many others
send their coldest regards.

1:15:16.495 --> 1:15:18.095
So, what, you guys
started a club?

1:15:21.017 --> 1:15:22.683
You guys-- do you guys meet
every Sunday night

1:15:22.910 --> 1:15:26.479
And bad mouth the man who
broke your heart?

1:15:28.266 --> 1:15:29.190
This is not funny.

1:15:31.194 --> 1:15:34.511
Dorothy, you let her rope you
into this? Come on.

1:15:34.531 --> 1:15:36.422
How are the grandkids,
by the way?

1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:38.699
- Bite me, thomas.
- Hey.

1:15:41.429 --> 1:15:44.038
So this is how you think
you're gonna win? Hmm.

1:15:44.265 --> 1:15:46.832
Ashley, I will make tess
disappear.

1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:51.103
We've already won, nicky.

1:15:51.196 --> 1:15:52.955
Do you realize where you are?

1:15:53.107 --> 1:15:56.625
We're in a room with you
where you have no control.

1:15:56.719 --> 1:15:59.295
Where we get a good laugh at you

1:15:59.389 --> 1:16:01.847
The way you've been laughing
at us this whole time.

1:16:04.227 --> 1:16:07.061
Whatever. I'll just disappear.

1:16:07.288 --> 1:16:09.230
There's a new site,

1:16:09.457 --> 1:16:11.307
There's a new face, there's
a new name.

1:16:11.401 --> 1:16:15.052
Maybe I'll date one of your
daughters in the future, hmm?

1:16:15.071 --> 1:16:17.888
Or a lonely niece, so you guys
can all get together

1:16:17.907 --> 1:16:21.224
And exchange sob stories.
Just the gals.

1:16:21.319 --> 1:16:23.319
You think this is a joke?

1:16:23.413 --> 1:16:25.162
You're not gonna be able to do
any of that.

1:16:27.642 --> 1:16:32.235
You see, you managed to dupe a
very interesting group of women.

1:16:32.330 --> 1:16:35.314
Clarissa, for instance,

1:16:35.333 --> 1:16:39.335
She's spent over 12 years,
working for one of

1:16:39.487 --> 1:16:43.155
The most respected forensic
accounting firms in the state,

1:16:43.174 --> 1:16:47.918
And boy, they are savage when it
comes to tracking wire fraud.

1:16:48.012 --> 1:16:52.607
And indra, well, let's just say
she knows a few folks

1:16:52.758 --> 1:16:55.926
Who just love a good excuse
to doxx a scammer.

1:16:56.020 --> 1:16:58.020
Great profile password,
by the way.

1:16:58.114 --> 1:17:00.281
"hot lady slayer 85."

1:17:00.432 --> 1:17:01.841
Hilarious.

1:17:01.934 --> 1:17:05.344
I mean, with the amount of
talent standing in this room,

1:17:05.363 --> 1:17:08.030
I'll be shocked if you're able
to show your face

1:17:08.182 --> 1:17:11.033
On any social media platform
ever again.

1:17:11.127 --> 1:17:13.352
That's, of course, if you're not
already on your way to jail

1:17:13.371 --> 1:17:15.046
For kidnapping and assault.

1:17:22.196 --> 1:17:25.288
You let me go or tess rots.

1:17:25.308 --> 1:17:28.050
Tess, right. That reminds me.

1:17:28.202 --> 1:17:30.369
Do you remember nancy?

1:17:30.388 --> 1:17:31.887
Yeah, you probably don't,

1:17:32.039 --> 1:17:34.223
Because it's been almost two
years since you broke her heart

1:17:34.375 --> 1:17:37.376
And stole her life savings.

1:17:37.395 --> 1:17:40.229
Well, nancy is now a manager
at parkway motels.

1:17:40.381 --> 1:17:42.064
Ever heard of them?

1:17:42.158 --> 1:17:44.474
Did you know they actually take
a digital snapshot

1:17:44.494 --> 1:17:46.402
Of every single one of
their guests?

1:17:46.496 --> 1:17:48.245
For security purposes.
