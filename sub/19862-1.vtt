00:02.300 --> 00:04.100
It's going to be triple digits here today.

00:04.200 --> 00:05.800
Along the Arizona-California border,

00:06.000 --> 00:07.600
so keep those pets inside.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.500
I think we gotta pull over, Brody.

00:34.600 --> 00:35.700
Again?

00:35.800 --> 00:38.100
Craig, you've been shitting across America.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.700
Seriously, I want to get there, man.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.800
Come on, guys.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.300
The cigar's hanging off the lip.

00:45.700 --> 00:47.000
I'm not going to make it.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.900
I'm not going to make it.
I'm not going to make it!

00:49.000 --> 00:50.300
Make sure you empty the tank,

00:50.400 --> 00:52.200
because this is the last time we're stopping.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.900
And don't forget to bury it!

00:54.000 --> 00:55.600
This is so bad for the environment.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.200
Gentlemen, according to my calculations,

01:03.300 --> 01:06.000
it's only 1,300 miles to Los Angeles.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.200
Remind me again why we didn't just fly.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.400
Don't you remember?

01:10.600 --> 01:13.500
We all decided we wanted to see America.

01:14.900 --> 01:15.900
Over it.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.200
Tunnel!

01:59.000 --> 02:00.500
- Oh, no.
- What?

02:00.600 --> 02:03.300
Did anyone remember to pack
our Gilmore Girls box set?

02:03.400 --> 02:05.800
Well, we didn't forget it
back home, did we?

02:05.900 --> 02:08.000
You guys, don't worry.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.500
It's cool. It's cool.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.200
I packed it in the gray suitcase.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.600
Thank God.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.600
- Rory.
- Lorelai.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.100
Grandma!

02:18.200 --> 02:20.100
Oh, man, I love gridlock.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.700
Yeah, check out all the hot chicks
in fancy cars.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.200
Maybe we could invite them all
over to our new pad.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.200
Here it is!

02:29.300 --> 02:30.900
On the right!
On the right!

02:38.500 --> 02:40.600
This can't be right.

02:40.700 --> 02:43.500
It's even better than I expected.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.800
Do you guys think any stars live here?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.900
Looks like Italy.

03:05.900 --> 03:08.600
Mort. Mort. Mort.

03:08.700 --> 03:09.900
- Skip the sermon.
- Ballsy! Come on!

03:10.000 --> 03:12.800
- And write it down this time.
- Come on, Ballsy!

03:12.900 --> 03:14.200
I have to go.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.200
I have gentlemen callers.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.500
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.600
May I help you?

03:24.700 --> 03:27.000
We were just looking for Marge the manager.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.400
You from the casino?

03:30.500 --> 03:31.400
No.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.700
IRS?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.000
No.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.900
Bed, Bath & Beyond?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.700
No.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.600
Well, I'm Marge.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.100
I'm Brody.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.700
I'm Craig.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.400
I'm Doug.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.200
We actually talked to you last week
about the fully-furnished

03:49.300 --> 03:52.000
and spacious efficiency apartments
with breath-taking views.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.300
Complimentary cable, including Skinimax.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.800
Deluxe kitchenette.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.900
And free unlimited street parking.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.300
When available.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.400
We just rolled into town.

04:02.500 --> 04:06.100
We're kind of wondering
if we can move in immediately.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.400
Where?

04:07.500 --> 04:09.500
Here.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.900
We sent you our deposit?

04:12.900 --> 04:14.800
I'm sorry.

04:14.900 --> 04:17.100
We have a no-pet policy.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.600
You know, the ca-ca and all?

04:19.800 --> 04:22.200
You're talking about Ballsy.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.600
Ballsy's not a pet.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.600
He's one of us.
He's family.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.100
He's very well-behaved.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.800
Yeah, you won't even know he's here.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.200
So... what kind of house you look for?

04:41.300 --> 04:44.100
Little house, medium house,

04:44.200 --> 04:47.300
big house, condominium?

04:47.400 --> 04:49.500
Well, basically, I guess we're just looking

04:49.600 --> 04:50.900
for something, you know, with a roof.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
You know, indoor plumbing,
maybe a couple of walls.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.200
Spacious enough to entertain friends.

04:56.300 --> 04:58.400
Yeah, and impressive enough
that it makes women

04:58.500 --> 05:00.300
want to have sex with us.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.700
Ridiculous.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.800
That going to cost you.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.900
Well, yeah, I mean, that's what we figured.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.400
But it's cool.
We got it covered.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.600
Yeah, you know...

05:10.700 --> 05:14.000
See, as luck would have it, our dog "Ballsy"

05:14.100 --> 05:17.100
suffered a minor maiming at the groomer's.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.300
A... medical faux pas, if you will.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.900
Like, you go to a drug store
to buy some shampoo...

05:23.000 --> 05:25.800
And instead, they cut off your balls.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.800
Sorry.

05:27.900 --> 05:31.500
I guess, on the bright side,
the tragedy afforded us all

05:31.600 --> 05:34.000
the opportunity to move
out of our parents' house.

05:34.100 --> 05:37.200
Oh, I see.
You boys real driven.

05:37.300 --> 05:41.100
Winnie, we have come halfway
across the country to start our lives.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.100
We can't just turn around and go home.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.800
My dad walks around
the house naked with his...

05:46.900 --> 05:49.600
And my nana's cookware is a joke.

05:49.700 --> 05:53.400
Listen, um... Kwang-fu.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.800
You can call me Winnie.

05:55.900 --> 05:59.300
Oh. Yes, ma'am.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.800
How old are you?

06:01.900 --> 06:03.700
Twenty-three.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.700
You look soft.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.100
Bring me the red file.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.600
Here. Red file.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.600
Softie.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.000
He's hot.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.700
I found you boys the perfect house.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.600
Furnished estate?

06:34.700 --> 06:36.800
- Hollywood Hills.
- They're cheap!

06:36.900 --> 06:38.200
We'll take it!

06:38.300 --> 06:39.500
Congratulations!

06:43.400 --> 06:45.100
Where are we?

06:45.200 --> 06:46.800
I don't know.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.500
I wish there were someone
we could ask for directions.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.200
What kind of crazed psycho

06:51.300 --> 06:53.100
would be out here at this time of night?

06:53.200 --> 06:54.700
What?

07:02.800 --> 07:03.700
Lock the door!

07:09.400 --> 07:10.900
Wait!

07:11.000 --> 07:13.200
I think it's just a Mexican.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.500
Maybe we can ask him directions.

07:20.700 --> 07:21.900
Hola, Mexican.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.800
I'm really sorry to bother you,

07:23.900 --> 07:26.200
but we're a little lost.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.600
See, we're looking
for our new el housio.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.100
I'm sorry?

07:36.200 --> 07:38.500
He keeps saying something
about el diablo.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.600
El diablo?

07:41.700 --> 07:42.900
Oh, my God.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.100
El diablo?

07:47.700 --> 07:49.600
Isn't that that super
hot, hot, hot, hot sauce?

07:49.700 --> 07:51.800
Yes, dude! Yes!

07:52.000 --> 07:53.400
He's probably just hungry.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.800
What do we got?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.100
Here. Here.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.200
You are in luck, my Latino friend.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.400
Offer him some ketchup.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.700
It's like white people hot sauce.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.600
We don't have any hot sauce,

08:12.700 --> 08:14.600
but we do have some ketchup.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.400
Yeah, and it won't burn your cheerio
like that el diablo stuff.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.300
- Yeah, all right.
- No, no, no!

08:21.500 --> 08:23.100
AquÃ­l

08:23.200 --> 08:24.700
Jesus, this guy's got a one-track mind.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.900
We're just going to have to
figure this out on our own.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.300
But good luck to you, friend.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.800
Yeah, and don't be such a food snob.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.000
Yeah, give ketchup a chance!

08:39.799 --> 08:43.900
El diablol

08:51.300 --> 08:52.400
I think this is it.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.300
Wow, I got goosebumps.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.000
Gentlemen, we're home.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.800
Wow...

09:08.200 --> 09:10.800
Killer pad.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.500
Doug, damn...

09:25.700 --> 09:27.800
Yeah. Yeah.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.900
Brody, you're hitting me.
You're hitting me!

09:34.100 --> 09:35.900
Hey, how's your book?

09:38.200 --> 09:40.700
Real page-turner, man.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.100
Real page-turner.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.700
It's home.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.000
Wow.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.900
You know, I think we should be
really proud of ourselves, guys.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.200
I mean, we did it!
You know?

10:08.300 --> 10:12.200
We finally moved out of our parents' house
and into our own place.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.800
Sure beats the view of my dad's balls.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.400
You know what I love most about this house?

10:17.500 --> 10:18.900
Lts functional floor plan?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.400
Self-cleaning ovens?

10:20.500 --> 10:24.600
I love... that it's going
to help us score with hot babes

10:24.700 --> 10:25.900
way out of our league.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.600
This house is perfect.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.900
Did you guys hear something?

10:38.100 --> 10:41.900
I didn't even know this room was down here.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.400
Sounds like it's coming from down here.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.100
Oh, Jesus!

11:06.500 --> 11:09.600
Previous owners must have had a lot of pets.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.700
That's actual the skull
of the Turkish dairy goat.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.900
Guys. Guys, over here.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.100
What is it, Brody?

11:18.200 --> 11:19.500
What'd you find?

11:21.800 --> 11:24.000
Looks like we got an open sewer line here.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.600
Now, there's an accident waiting to happen.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.100
Hey, it's warm.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.800
Oh, yeah.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.900
Hey, look, a coyote.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.900
He's kinda cute.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.600
- You are.
- Yeah, maybe he can hang out.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.800
And him and Ballsy could have a play date.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.000
Or not.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.500
He must have come in
from the hills through that hole.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.200
Maybe if we scare him,
he'll just run out the way he came in.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.100
Now, I'm going to count to three.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.100
And we're going to take him.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.400
All right.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.200
One... two...

12:05.900 --> 12:07.600
Then again, there is another option.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.400
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.300
I got another one.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.400
Okay, wait.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.900
Who am I?

12:25.100 --> 12:26.600
You're a Turkish dairy goat.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.900
Guys, wouldn't it be funny if that coyote

12:32.000 --> 12:34.100
was some kind of demon and this...

12:34.200 --> 12:36.600
and that open sewer
was actually some kind of portal to hell,

12:36.700 --> 12:38.300
and the longer we stayed in this house,

12:38.400 --> 12:41.200
the greater chance there was
of us being brutally murdered

12:41.300 --> 12:43.200
and sacrificed to the devil?

12:50.900 --> 12:53.600
That would be...

12:53.700 --> 12:55.400
awesome!

13:30.700 --> 13:33.100
Oh, BeyoncÃ©.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.400
Were you spooning me?

14:03.100 --> 14:04.200
Why, hello.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.100
Welcome to our humble abode.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.500
Would you like to come in?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.000
Yeah, we live here.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.000
Oh, thank you.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.300
Hi.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.800
I'm Lucy, from next door.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.600
Next door?

14:29.700 --> 14:32.800
It seemed like we were all alone
up on this hill.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.400
We're actually from down quite a ways.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
We?

14:36.600 --> 14:39.000
I'm a volunteer at Hope House.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.600
That's great.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.100
What's that?

14:43.200 --> 14:44.600
Oh, it's a place where people can go

14:44.700 --> 14:46.600
when they're sick and don't have any money

14:46.700 --> 14:49.400
or friends or family or resources.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.400
Yeah, sounds a lot like Craig's house.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.200
Yeah, Craig's dad walks around naked.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.300
What?

14:56.400 --> 14:57.300
No.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.700
Oh, I made you a cake.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.800
It's angel food.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.100
Thank you very much.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.400
She's hot and she bakes.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.700
Can I cut you piece or something?

15:11.800 --> 15:13.200
Oh, no, no.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.400
I never eat angel food.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.400
I just wanted to stop by and welcome you
to the neighborhood.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.300
Yeah, nobody takes
the time anymore, you know?

15:21.400 --> 15:23.500
All the homes are so private and secluded.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.800
That's pretty much the only drawback
to this place, right?

15:26.900 --> 15:29.700
Maybe you could have
a housewarming or something.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.900
Hey, that's a great idea!

15:32.000 --> 15:35.200
Like a huge party!

15:35.300 --> 15:37.900
Well, I should be getting back.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.100
Wait, wait, wait.

15:39.300 --> 15:42.900
If we were to have a party...

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
would you come?

15:47.300 --> 15:50.500
Well, if you're inviting me...

15:50.600 --> 15:53.700
I'd love to.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.000
Bye, now.

16:04.700 --> 16:07.000
We have got great neighbors!

16:07.100 --> 16:08.700
Wow.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.700
You guys, we can't throw a party.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.700
What? Why not?

16:13.900 --> 16:16.700
Because who are we going to invite?

16:18.100 --> 16:19.400
Man, Doug's right.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.700
We don't know anybody around here.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.000
Except Lucy.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.500
And that ungrateful Mexican.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.800
Doug. Ungrateful Latino.

16:27.900 --> 16:30.400
Whatever.
Ungrateful nevertheless.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.400
Don't worry, guys.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.000
I've got an idea.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.300
Brody, this is magnificent.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.600
Thank you.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.500
Now all we gotta do is decide who to invite.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.500
Well, that's easy.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.100
Chicks under 20 who enjoy getting wasted.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.900
And have a history of poor judgment.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.600
Or either naive or insecure.

16:59.700 --> 17:02.700
I would do just about
anything for free copies.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.500
Sorry, guys.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.400
I got a little excited.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.500
I don't get out much.

17:12.599 --> 17:13.800
I still live at home.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.800
My dad walks around the house naked.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.900
Hey, kid.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.100
You're partying with us.

17:36.100 --> 17:37.800
Really?

17:37.900 --> 17:39.300
Thank you.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.400
Thank you so much.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.000
Hey! Hey!
What are you doin' there?

17:51.100 --> 17:53.000
Oh, shit! Run!

17:54.300 --> 17:55.500
I'll call the cops!

17:55.600 --> 17:57.100
- Get back here!
- Go! Go! Go!

18:06.400 --> 18:09.400
Forgive me, Father... for I have sinned.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.300
- Wow, hi.
- Please come. Please.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.200
Hey, you wanna...

18:20.300 --> 18:21.300
Hi.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.900
Thank you.
What is this?

18:23.100 --> 18:24.100
We're having a party.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.400
Give it to me. It's mine.

18:46.300 --> 18:47.600
That's a wrap!

18:50.400 --> 18:54.200
Hi. Please come to my party.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.300
Take mine.
Take mine.

18:56.400 --> 19:00.600
Hey, we're throwing this party,
if you wanna...

19:00.700 --> 19:02.200
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Give me this.

19:02.300 --> 19:03.500
- Get out of here.
- Give me this.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.400
This is for the...

19:05.500 --> 19:07.300
Get out... Give me the...

19:16.500 --> 19:18.600
What's the matter with Ballsy?

19:20.200 --> 19:21.500
Really hot in here.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.200
Kinda smells like eggs.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.500
Hey, guys.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.100
What the hell happened here?

19:32.200 --> 19:34.800
Somebody broke into our house.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.800
Oh, my toaster.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.800
You guys, lookit.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.000
It all makes sense.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.100
How could we have been so blind?

19:56.200 --> 19:57.400
What?

19:57.500 --> 19:58.800
What are you talking about?

19:58.900 --> 20:01.000
Don't you see?

20:01.100 --> 20:02.500
The hellacious stench?

20:02.600 --> 20:04.600
The ungodly heat?

20:04.700 --> 20:06.500
The forbidden fruit?

20:08.600 --> 20:10.500
I know what did this.

20:10.600 --> 20:15.500
It was a bunch of God damned squatters!

20:15.600 --> 20:17.600
You think weightlifters did this?

20:17.700 --> 20:19.800
No, vagrants.
You know, transients.

20:19.900 --> 20:22.000
Squatters?

20:22.100 --> 20:25.700
What if the squatters broke in
through that open sewer,

20:25.800 --> 20:27.900
just like that coyote,

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
and have been living
secretly in our basement for months?

20:32.100 --> 20:36.100
So... you're saying that

20:36.200 --> 20:39.500
a bunch of apple-eatin'
homeless people

20:39.600 --> 20:41.000
living in our basement

20:41.100 --> 20:43.700
are doing all this freaky stuff

20:43.800 --> 20:45.000
just to scare us off?

20:45.100 --> 20:47.000
That is exactly what I think.

20:47.100 --> 20:48.500
Oh, you're good.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.900
But I'll tell you what.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.300
This is our house now.

20:53.400 --> 20:58.700
And come hell or come high water,
we are staying put!

21:00.300 --> 21:01.700
Yes!

21:01.800 --> 21:04.800
But what if they're still here?

21:35.400 --> 21:37.300
Oh, God!

21:37.400 --> 21:38.700
Just disgusting.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.200
It's all kinds of nasty.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.600
Rude.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.700
It's a squatter!

21:49.800 --> 21:51.700
He still wants el diablo.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.300
Again with the el diablo.

21:59.700 --> 22:02.200
Look, ese...

22:02.300 --> 22:04.300
No el diablo.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.100
No hablo espanolo.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.600
Oh, my God!

22:51.300 --> 22:53.300
- What!
- No!

23:04.100 --> 23:05.000
What?

23:11.500 --> 23:13.000
Whoa!

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Where did he go?

23:22.100 --> 23:25.100
That guy just ripped out his own heart.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.200
And tracked mud all in the house.

23:31.900 --> 23:33.100
You guys?

23:33.200 --> 23:35.000
These squatters are crazy.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.300
I know.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.600
They'll try anything to get us out.

23:40.300 --> 23:42.100
Well, the only way we're getting out

23:42.200 --> 23:45.400
is in three bloody body bags.

23:46.600 --> 23:47.900
Yeah.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
They're not gonna scare us off
with their cheap carnival tricks.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.000
They must think we're a bunch of pussies.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.300
- Yeah.
- Oh, boys!

23:58.400 --> 23:59.700
Is everything okay here?

24:02.200 --> 24:05.900
We're chillin'.
It's Lucy.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.500
- Oh, we're totally fine.
- Oh, yeah.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.500
These are my friends:

24:10.600 --> 24:11.500
Delilah...

24:11.600 --> 24:14.000
What's up?

24:14.100 --> 24:15.400
...and Jezebel.

24:15.500 --> 24:18.000
Hey.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.000
I was looking for that.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.800
Hey, little pootchie,
pootchie, pootchie-kins.

24:45.900 --> 24:48.300
Here you go, boy.
Fetch. Here you go.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.600
They were wondering if it would be okay
if they came to your party.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.600
- Absolutely.
- Indeed.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.400
- Please do.
- Great!

24:59.500 --> 25:01.600
Oh, and we brought something
for you to listen to.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.500
- Absolutely.
- Indeed.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.000
Please do.

25:15.700 --> 25:17.400
What do you think?

25:19.900 --> 25:20.800
I don't know.

25:20.900 --> 25:22.300
You know, it's a little...

25:22.400 --> 25:24.700
They're called Demon Semen.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.700
I think they'd be perfect for your party.

25:26.800 --> 25:31.300
I think we're looking for something
with a little more woodwind.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.800
Yeah, you know,
maybe something, like,

25:33.900 --> 25:36.200
just a little bit less terrifying.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.100
Yeah, they sound really creepy.

25:39.900 --> 25:44.900
It totally makes us wanna do
all kinds of, like, bad things.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.600
Things that we would
normally never, ever, ever do.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.700
Like what?

25:52.800 --> 25:54.000
Like this.

25:57.300 --> 25:58.900
Like what?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.600
Like what?

26:04.900 --> 26:07.500
I think I released some Demon Semen.

26:10.800 --> 26:11.900
Your tongue tastes so good.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.500
Like what?

26:16.100 --> 26:17.400
I've got so much food
for the party tonight.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.800
I've got so much food
for the party tonight.

26:18.900 --> 26:20.600
I've been baking this since noon.

26:20.700 --> 26:23.100
- Nana's recipe.
- Oh, boy.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.000
- Oh, boy.
- Try one.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.500
Good.
All right.

26:30.500 --> 26:31.400
And?

26:31.500 --> 26:33.200
You can bake.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.800
You can bake!

26:34.900 --> 26:37.700
And you are the best sous-chef ever.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.200
Wait, what's a sous-chef?

26:43.300 --> 26:44.800
The chopper-upper.

26:44.900 --> 26:47.900
Oh, then yes.

26:51.300 --> 26:53.300
I gotta tell you guys,

26:53.400 --> 26:55.800
these Saudi-built detectors
just don't cut the mustard.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.300
Now, I'm afraid,
if you want a party permit,

27:00.400 --> 27:03.400
you're gonna have to bring
this building up to code.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.800
Of course...

27:06.300 --> 27:08.800
Well, there is one other option.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.400
- There is?
- Tell us. We'll do anything.

27:10.500 --> 27:13.300
Well, now, this is gonna
be a big party, right?

27:13.400 --> 27:17.300
Refreshments and dancing and a lot
of interesting people to talk to?

27:17.400 --> 27:20.200
Oh, yeah. There's gonna be chicks
and booze everywhere.

27:20.300 --> 27:22.500
Yeah, and my famous
butterscotch bunnies.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.400
Thanks, no.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.300
Mind if I smoke?

27:28.400 --> 27:29.300
- Well, now...
- No.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.600
Let's say...

27:31.700 --> 27:36.300
you can get a trained
professional to be on hand?

27:36.400 --> 27:38.400
I don't know.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.600
What do you think, Doug?

27:40.700 --> 27:42.600
Sounds expensive.

27:42.700 --> 27:44.300
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure you could find

27:44.400 --> 27:47.400
someone who would donate
their time, you know?

27:47.500 --> 27:51.700
Someone who's lost direction.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.000
Someone who's never been comfortable

27:54.100 --> 27:56.300
with the whole on-line dating scene

27:56.400 --> 27:58.600
but still thinks there's an outside chance

27:58.700 --> 28:00.900
that there's someone
out there that's just right for him.

28:02.100 --> 28:04.000
Yeah, I don't know.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.700
I don't know how I'd feel

28:06.800 --> 28:09.300
about having some poor
bastard work for free.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.200
It's un-American.

28:11.300 --> 28:13.800
No, no.
You gotta trust me on this one.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.100
I mean, he wouldn't mind.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.900
I mean, not like
when his wife of 17 years,

28:18.000 --> 28:19.500
who he treated like a goddess,

28:19.600 --> 28:23.000
left him for Tom at MySpace. Com.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.500
It kinda sounds like
your friend might be...

28:26.600 --> 28:27.600
be gay.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.200
Why?
You gay?

28:31.300 --> 28:32.700
Nice apron.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.200
Anyway, that's beside the point.

28:34.300 --> 28:37.000
What do you say
you just help a firefighter out?

28:37.100 --> 28:40.100
He's a very close, dear friend of mine,

28:40.200 --> 28:41.700
although he's not gay.

28:41.800 --> 28:45.500
Look, Mr. Fire Marshal.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.000
Let's just say we replace

28:48.100 --> 28:51.700
all the smoke detectors
in the entire house,

28:51.800 --> 28:55.100
what are the chances that
we pass inspection then?

28:55.200 --> 29:00.700
Hmm, well, I'd have to say
slim and none.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.500
We're saving those.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.600
Oh, for the party?

29:08.900 --> 29:11.000
Hey, you guys,

29:11.100 --> 29:14.000
I got the most awesome idea
for the party, okay?

29:16.800 --> 29:19.500
- What's wrong with you two?
- Dude, the party's over, man.

29:19.600 --> 29:22.100
Thanks a lot,
Mr. Fire Marshal.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.400
Fire Marshal?
What fire marshal?

29:23.500 --> 29:25.600
The one that said the
house wasn't up to code.

29:25.700 --> 29:28.400
Yeah, so, unless
we can pull a trained fire professional

29:28.600 --> 29:31.600
who will work for free
right out of our asses,

29:31.700 --> 29:34.000
which is practically impossible...

29:34.100 --> 29:36.300
How did he know we were having a party?

29:36.400 --> 29:40.200
His "friend" found this at a strip club.

29:40.300 --> 29:43.400
You guys let a fire marshal in here?

29:45.400 --> 29:47.100
What a hell hole.

29:52.300 --> 29:53.300
What the hell?

30:03.200 --> 30:06.200
Oh, yeah, this gotta be
a code-eight violation.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.300
You let him go down
in the basement?

30:12.400 --> 30:13.900
With all those violations?

30:14.000 --> 30:16.100
Now we gotta bribe him!

30:17.800 --> 30:19.500
Hello?

30:19.600 --> 30:21.000
Baloney.

30:21.100 --> 30:23.500
Ice cold beverage.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.800
Mr. Fire Marshal?

30:27.300 --> 30:28.800
Salami.

30:28.900 --> 30:30.500
Oh, my God.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.800
What is it?

30:33.900 --> 30:35.400
We passed!

30:37.100 --> 30:38.200
Yes!

31:26.300 --> 31:29.700
Well, looks like
this place is missing just one thing.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.200
I cannot believe you found Backwater!

31:44.200 --> 31:45.400
I cannot believe you found Backwater!

31:45.500 --> 31:46.600
I know.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.300
Last I heard, he was in a full body cast

31:48.400 --> 31:50.500
from doing a flying squirrel
into a pool with no water.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.800
Do you guys remember

31:52.900 --> 31:56.400
the time that he ran
out of beer and he drank his own pee?

31:56.500 --> 32:00.100
Yeah, that pee got him wasted.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.800
I know.
Me, too.

32:02.900 --> 32:05.100
Here he is, guys.
Here he is.

32:19.700 --> 32:22.200
- That's not Backwater.
- Yeah, who's the rabbi?

32:22.300 --> 32:24.400
Asshole!

32:24.500 --> 32:25.800
Backwater?

32:27.300 --> 32:31.000
Wow, I can actually see
the whites of your eyes.

32:31.100 --> 32:33.100
Did you bring your laminated name tag,

32:33.200 --> 32:35.300
just in case you get
so wasted you forget your name

32:35.400 --> 32:38.200
and end up in Mexico again?

32:38.300 --> 32:39.500
Remember that?

32:41.000 --> 32:44.100
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen
again this year, boys.

32:44.200 --> 32:47.500
What, you pass out?
No way.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.500
Drugs and alcohol
were a crutch for me.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.700
But since I found the Lord,

32:52.800 --> 32:55.300
I realize I no longer need them.

32:55.400 --> 32:56.600
Are you joking?

32:56.700 --> 32:58.200
No.

32:58.300 --> 33:01.200
I get it.
You're stoned right now.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.300
Me, too.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.300
Okay, look, guys, the truth is
I'm here for me.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.800
For the first time since I was six,

33:12.900 --> 33:15.600
I am completely drug and alcohol free.

33:15.700 --> 33:18.700
And let me tell you, it feels great.

33:18.800 --> 33:21.500
In a few weeks, I'll be joining the order.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.900
So I figured your party
would be the ultimate test

33:24.000 --> 33:27.400
of my spiritual fortitude.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.200
I've come to face my demons, boys.

33:40.400 --> 33:41.800
- Band room.
- Check.

33:41.900 --> 33:43.200
- Catering.
- Check.

33:43.300 --> 33:45.800
- Check.
- Check.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.700
- Check.
- Let's do this.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.800
All right, boys and girls.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.400
Showtime.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.400
Welcome to our pad.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.100
I think I speak for all of us

34:08.199 --> 34:09.800
when I say we were really touched

34:09.900 --> 34:11.100
by your work in Indiana Bones.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.900
And Position: Lmpossible.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.100
I saw Meet the Knockers

34:15.199 --> 34:17.100
37... 38 times.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.000
That's my favorite.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.500
Mine, too.

34:24.300 --> 34:27.199
I love your necklace.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.000
I mean every letter of it.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.100
Whoa!
You got a flyer?

34:33.199 --> 34:35.000
Great job on the bouncers.

34:35.100 --> 34:36.800
Yeah, where'd you get these guys?

34:36.900 --> 34:38.300
Food court.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.500
You see this party?

34:39.600 --> 34:40.600
This is what you're missing tonight.

34:40.699 --> 34:41.800
Now get out.

34:41.900 --> 34:44.100
Girls with chains and spikes.

34:46.300 --> 34:47.900
- That was you, wasn't it.
- Yeah.

34:50.500 --> 34:51.600
Handsome woman.

34:53.500 --> 34:56.300
- Pretty man.
- Indeed.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.900
Whoa. Whoa.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.500
Hold on.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.000
I'm sorry, but there's going
to be a lot of sex

35:05.100 --> 35:08.000
and booze and
hardcore perversion at this party

35:08.100 --> 35:10.800
I'm afraid I'm gonna
need to see some IDs.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.900
But these say you're all only 16.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.500
Is that a problem?

35:19.600 --> 35:21.900
These things better not be bogus.

35:37.700 --> 35:40.600
Wow, you girls look great.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.700
Thanks, so do you.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.300
Almost good enough to eat.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.600
And we are totally starving.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.400
So we'll see you inside.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.700
This is gonna be one hell of a party.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.600
I hope so.

35:59.900 --> 36:03.500
Excuse me.
Attention.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.200
You gotta turn it on, man.

36:06.900 --> 36:09.500
If I could just have
everyone's attention, please.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.800
Just for a second.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.100
My name is Brody,

36:13.200 --> 36:15.500
and these are my two
best friends in the whole world,

36:15.600 --> 36:17.500
Doug and Craig.

36:17.600 --> 36:20.300
And we'd just like to welcome you our...

36:22.000 --> 36:24.500
new den of debauchery!

36:31.200 --> 36:33.200
And now without further ado,

36:33.300 --> 36:35.300
I'd like you guys
to give a warm welcome

36:35.400 --> 36:36.800
to our house band,

36:36.900 --> 36:38.700
Demon Semen!

37:20.700 --> 37:22.400
Bitch.

37:40.100 --> 37:41.900
Who's ready to raise hell tonight?

37:47.200 --> 37:48.700
God damn men.

38:36.500 --> 38:39.000
Hurry up in there.

39:00.700 --> 39:01.800
No!

39:09.800 --> 39:11.800
Looks like someone clogged the toilet.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.500
Looks like they had Coney's.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.100
Oh, man, I love Coney's.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.900
Yeah, me, too.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.600
It's so good.

39:21.700 --> 39:22.900
Delicious.

39:25.300 --> 39:28.900
Wow, that turd is really wedged in there.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.800
Yeah, it's huge.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.200
It kinda looks like a human head.

39:38.300 --> 39:42.100
I mean, check it out.
It's even got eyes.

39:43.300 --> 39:46.800
Oh, yeah.
That's staring right up at us.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.900
It's starting to freak me out.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.300
Yeah... me, too.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.600
Stop staring at me, turd!
You're freaking me out!

39:55.700 --> 39:58.400
Turn your head, turd.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.400
All right, give me the plunger.

40:00.500 --> 40:01.400
Stand back.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.700
Wait!
Craig, wait!

40:02.900 --> 40:05.100
- What?
- We should take a picture of this.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.600
We could send it in to ratemypoo. Com

40:09.300 --> 40:12.400
Oh, yeah.
Yes, we could win 50 bucks.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.500
We gotta say you did it.
It's more impressive.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.700
Right.

40:17.600 --> 40:18.900
Say feces!

40:21.000 --> 40:22.500
Can you hear me now?

40:22.600 --> 40:23.800
Can you hear me now?

40:24.800 --> 40:26.200
I hate cell phones.

40:26.300 --> 40:29.700
Heidi, listen,
you sent me to the wrong place.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.300
What?
No.

40:31.400 --> 40:32.900
Keep quiet.
I'm gonna probably lose you any minute.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.400
Listen to me.

40:34.500 --> 40:37.100
I hired you to get me
to the places I need to get to.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.600
You sent me to the wrong place, Heidi.

40:39.700 --> 40:43.400
What? No.
No, I'm not at Tobey's house, Heidi.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.600
What? No.

40:44.700 --> 40:46.900
No, not Moby. Tobey.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.200
Heidi, I don't even know Moby.

40:50.400 --> 40:51.800
I'm a big fan of his music, too.

40:51.900 --> 40:53.400
Listen to me.
Just keep quiet.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.400
Look, look...

40:55.500 --> 40:57.200
I need you to get me to Tobey's house.

40:57.300 --> 40:59.800
Because right now
I am stuck in the middle of this...

40:59.900 --> 41:02.600
this very weird,
very strange house party.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.800
What?

41:06.900 --> 41:08.800
I don't know if there are
any other celebrities here, Heidi,

41:08.900 --> 41:09.900
and I don't care.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.000
I just... Listen to me.

41:11.100 --> 41:12.800
Heidi! Look, I...

41:13.000 --> 41:13.900
Hello? Hello?

41:14.100 --> 41:16.100
Hello.

41:16.300 --> 41:19.300
You know, you're never going
to find what you're looking for

41:19.400 --> 41:20.700
at the bottom of that glass.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.000
What?

41:22.100 --> 41:23.200
What's your name?

41:24.800 --> 41:26.700
- Joe.
- Joe, take a look around.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.900
I'll tell you what I see.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.100
I see you and your friends
heading down a path,

41:32.200 --> 41:34.000
a path to ruin.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.000
What are you talking about?

41:36.100 --> 41:37.700
I'm talking about that right there.

41:37.800 --> 41:39.000
Whaddaya got?
Punch?

41:39.100 --> 41:41.100
It's not punch, Joe.
It's poison.

41:41.200 --> 41:44.400
And the more of that poison
that you put into those veins,

41:44.500 --> 41:47.000
the further you fall into a pit.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.700
A pit... of despair.

41:52.700 --> 41:53.900
Are you kidding me?
I don't even...

41:54.000 --> 41:55.400
I don't even know any of these people.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.000
I'm not even supposed to be here right now.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.300
You know where
I'm supposed to be?

41:58.400 --> 42:00.300
I'm supposed to be
at Tobey Maguire's house...

42:00.400 --> 42:01.400
that's right...
to play poker tonight.

42:01.500 --> 42:02.500
I don't know who that is.

42:02.600 --> 42:05.200
- Spider-Man?
- Nah.

42:05.300 --> 42:06.400
- Seabiscuit?
- Never saw it.

42:06.500 --> 42:07.900
Movie with a horse?
You never saw it?

42:08.000 --> 42:10.500
No. The only superstar I worship...

42:10.600 --> 42:12.800
Forget it. Is there a phone
around here that I can use?

42:12.900 --> 42:14.400
If you listen to your heart,

42:14.500 --> 42:17.400
you won't need to phone anyone.

42:18.600 --> 42:19.800
Okay.

42:19.900 --> 42:21.700
Oh, my God.
No offense, Father.

42:21.800 --> 42:25.400
Look, the point is that just doesn't
help me out at all right now.

42:25.500 --> 42:26.800
But thank you.

42:26.900 --> 42:28.700
- Why don't you have a drink?
- Oh, no, no. I don't...

42:28.800 --> 42:30.700
No, have it, it's lovely.
It's a lovely drink.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.400
- I'm not supposed to drink.
- Great dog. Cute dog.

42:37.400 --> 42:40.200
Drink me.

42:40.300 --> 42:43.900
What?

42:51.500 --> 42:52.400
Hey, boo.

42:52.500 --> 42:54.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.400
Hey, Doug, put me down.

42:56.500 --> 42:57.600
Put me down, Doug.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.600
Hey. Just...

43:00.600 --> 43:02.700
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:02.800 --> 43:04.200
That's a great band.

43:04.300 --> 43:07.100
Yeah, yeah, we love the Demon Semen.

43:07.200 --> 43:08.900
- Yeah, good call.
- Thanks.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.600
So, how about
a private tour of the house?

43:13.700 --> 43:16.500
Ooh, that'd be great.

43:16.600 --> 43:19.100
But how about after we have a few drinks.

43:19.200 --> 43:20.200
Yeah.

43:20.300 --> 43:23.600
Because, you know,
alcohol lowers all our inhibitions.

43:26.100 --> 43:28.300
That is so sweet.

43:28.400 --> 43:32.300
Why don't you wait right here while
the two of us go freshen up a little?

43:32.400 --> 43:33.700
Yeah, yeah.

43:33.800 --> 43:35.200
And then we'll take that tour.

43:35.300 --> 43:37.300
Starting with the bedrooms.

43:37.400 --> 43:39.300
Okay.

43:39.400 --> 43:42.100
- We can do that.
- I can do that. Can you do that?

43:42.200 --> 43:43.900
I'll be there.
Are you going to be there?

43:44.000 --> 43:47.700
So, you want a shot?

43:47.800 --> 43:50.100
Oh. I don't know.

43:50.200 --> 43:52.800
I mean, I already have this beer.

43:52.900 --> 43:55.800
And one's usually my limit.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.100
I give you permission
to get a little wild.

44:00.800 --> 44:04.300
Well, okay. If you say so.

44:04.500 --> 44:05.900
So, what are my options?

44:06.000 --> 44:07.900
Oh, we've got everything.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.600
I mean, the previous owner
left us a ton of spirits...

44:10.700 --> 44:13.200
vodka, rum, gin, tequila,

44:13.300 --> 44:16.300
and of course Doug's
marshmallow surprise punch.

44:16.400 --> 44:17.300
Wow.

44:17.400 --> 44:19.600
They all sound so good.

44:19.700 --> 44:23.200
How about I try one of each?

44:23.300 --> 44:26.500
But promise you'll stop me
if I get carried away.

44:26.600 --> 44:28.300
Don't you worry.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.300
I can handle my liquor.

44:36.800 --> 44:39.500
Gwen, can you feel it in the air?

44:39.600 --> 44:40.600
Yeah.

44:40.700 --> 44:44.000
It's like there's evil all around us.

44:46.200 --> 44:49.100
Hey, girls.
Neat party, huh?

44:50.700 --> 44:52.900
Oh, I don't know if you girls know this,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.400
but I'm actually really tight friends

44:55.500 --> 44:57.600
with the guys who live here.

44:57.700 --> 44:58.900
Don't want to get your hopes up,

44:59.000 --> 45:04.800
but I might be getting some
Barry Manilow tickets pretty soon.

45:06.400 --> 45:07.700
You know what would be funny?

45:07.800 --> 45:10.300
If you took your top off
and I saw your breasts and I was like,

45:10.500 --> 45:12.700
"Hey, I can't believe you did that... "

45:14.900 --> 45:18.100
Hey, how do you eat cereal
with that lip thing...

45:22.200 --> 45:24.900
Say goodbye to those BM tickets!

45:27.100 --> 45:29.600
Your back structure's exquisite.

45:29.700 --> 45:31.600
I want to lick it.

45:31.700 --> 45:35.300
Guys, this place is so cool.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.900
Totally bad.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
I wonder who we have an intimate,

45:40.100 --> 45:42.500
meaningful conversation with to stay here.

45:48.100 --> 45:50.300
These jets are intense!

45:50.400 --> 45:51.900
I'm totally sweating!

45:52.000 --> 45:54.700
I'm getting so hot.

45:56.300 --> 45:59.200
Guys, it's hot.

45:59.300 --> 46:03.200
I think it's getting a little too hot.

46:14.600 --> 46:18.000
Delilah, Jezebel?

46:18.100 --> 46:20.600
Where are you little devils?

46:21.800 --> 46:24.400
Doug... check it out.

46:24.500 --> 46:25.400
Wow.

46:25.500 --> 46:26.900
Triplets.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.200
Check this out.

46:38.100 --> 46:40.500
Hey, girls.

46:40.600 --> 46:42.700
How's the water?

46:42.800 --> 46:44.400
Good one.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Mind if we come in?

46:51.200 --> 46:53.800
- Well, I guess we can take that as a yes.
- They didn't say no.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.300
Impressive.

46:59.400 --> 47:01.400
I know.

47:04.200 --> 47:05.900
Okay, all right.
They're fine.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.200
They're fine out there.

47:07.300 --> 47:09.400
You're okay, they're okay.

47:09.500 --> 47:10.900
They're okay.
Right, Ballsy?

47:11.000 --> 47:12.900
Oh, my God!

47:16.600 --> 47:18.100
How did you get up there?

47:18.200 --> 47:20.900
That's warm.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.400
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

47:23.500 --> 47:26.100
- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

47:27.700 --> 47:30.500
Hello, triplets.

47:31.800 --> 47:35.900
So, Tecates for the hot-tays?

47:37.100 --> 47:39.400
Why don't you just hang on to that?

47:42.000 --> 47:43.200
Or not.

47:43.300 --> 47:44.900
So which one of you was born first?

47:45.000 --> 47:46.500
Doug?

47:46.600 --> 47:48.700
These girls look cooked.

47:48.800 --> 47:50.800
I know, they're totally baked.

47:50.900 --> 47:52.500
They can't even speak.

47:52.600 --> 47:55.000
No, man.

47:55.100 --> 47:59.500
I think that they're dead.

48:00.700 --> 48:03.300
Holy shit!

48:11.500 --> 48:13.200
You got a little piece of corpse on you!

48:13.300 --> 48:15.300
Get it off!
Get it off!

48:17.000 --> 48:19.500
All right, all right,
we got to just stay calm.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.400
Stay calm?

48:21.500 --> 48:25.100
The Von Schlutz triplets
are dead in our hot tub!

48:25.200 --> 48:26.400
What do we do?

48:26.600 --> 48:28.500
Doug, relax!

48:28.600 --> 48:32.300
We've just got to think, man.

48:32.400 --> 48:35.500
Now, first things first.

48:35.600 --> 48:37.100
We drink another beer.

48:37.200 --> 48:39.700
She's got my beer!
She's got my beer!

48:39.800 --> 48:42.900
- Here.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

48:44.700 --> 48:46.300
Okay, then we call the cops.

48:46.400 --> 48:48.400
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy, man?

48:48.500 --> 48:50.100
We can't call the cops.

48:50.200 --> 48:52.500
- Okay, no cops. Why?
- Because!

48:52.600 --> 48:56.500
We got dead triplets floating in our hot tub.

48:56.700 --> 48:58.200
They'll shut the party down, man.

48:58.300 --> 48:59.600
Maybe even impound the house.

48:59.800 --> 49:01.600
No, no, no!
We can't let that happen!

49:01.700 --> 49:02.900
I know.

49:03.000 --> 49:08.900
And all because of one completely random
freak party accident.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.200
And we haven't even scored yet!

49:10.300 --> 49:12.700
Yes! Yes! See?
Same page every time!

49:12.800 --> 49:14.100
- Okay, all right.
- All right, all right.

49:14.200 --> 49:15.200
- Okay, what do we do?
- Look.

49:15.300 --> 49:17.900
We'll call the cops in the morning, okay,

49:18.000 --> 49:19.900
after everyone's gone.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.700
And then we'll replace
all the smoke detectors in the house.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.500
- Fine.
- Okay.

49:25.600 --> 49:27.900
But for now...

49:28.000 --> 49:31.100
I say that we don't tell anybody, okay?

49:31.200 --> 49:33.200
Not even Brody.

49:33.300 --> 49:34.300
Oh, no, no.

49:34.500 --> 49:36.100
Especially not Brody.

49:36.200 --> 49:38.600
Yes!

49:38.700 --> 49:40.100
Okay.

49:42.200 --> 49:45.200
What do we do with these poor girls
in the meantime?

50:00.400 --> 50:02.600
Oh, no, it's empty.

50:02.700 --> 50:05.700
Maybe we should just slow down
just a wee bit, though.

50:05.800 --> 50:07.800
Oh, okay.

50:07.900 --> 50:09.300
Maybe you're right.

50:09.400 --> 50:13.500
Hey, do you know
what I've always wanted to do?

50:13.600 --> 50:15.500
Can we... just get some air?

50:15.600 --> 50:17.200
Pop my top.

50:17.300 --> 50:19.500
I think that is a great idea.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.300
You know, like, in public?

50:21.400 --> 50:23.200
Just jump up on a table and rip it off!

50:23.300 --> 50:25.000
I think that is a great idea.

50:25.100 --> 50:26.400
Really?

50:26.500 --> 50:31.500
Hey, maybe I could just
pop it right here for you.

50:31.600 --> 50:33.200
Like, for practice.

50:33.300 --> 50:34.800
I think that's a great idea.

50:34.900 --> 50:36.200
Hey.

50:36.300 --> 50:38.100
Hey!

50:38.200 --> 50:40.200
Aren't you that famous guy Brody,

50:40.300 --> 50:42.600
who's like... owns this killer place,

50:42.700 --> 50:45.600
who, like, is responsible
for this killer bash, right?

50:45.800 --> 50:46.800
Yeah.

50:46.900 --> 50:50.400
Yeah. Oh, dude, there's some people
looking for you out front.

50:50.500 --> 50:52.600
They seem pretty mad or something.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.100
Hold that thought.

50:58.200 --> 51:01.800
So, uh, is your dad, like, a robber,

51:01.900 --> 51:04.600
because he stole some stars
and put them in your eyes.

51:13.300 --> 51:15.400
We caught him speaking
in tongues down at the curb.

51:15.500 --> 51:16.800
He's scaring away all the Mexican trim.

51:16.900 --> 51:19.100
Senores, el diablo estÃ¡n...

51:19.200 --> 51:20.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know.

51:20.700 --> 51:23.400
El diablo aquÃ­ en tu casa.

51:23.500 --> 51:26.600
This hot sauce is making him mental.

51:26.700 --> 51:27.900
Although, I do like the tie.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.800
It's a nice touch.

51:29.900 --> 51:31.600
What do you want us to do with him, boss?

51:31.700 --> 51:33.900
Well, I don't know.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.800
I mean, what are my options?

51:35.900 --> 51:38.500
Let's see.
We could whack him.

51:38.600 --> 51:39.600
Whack him?

51:39.700 --> 51:41.800
Oh, sure.
We've done it before.

51:41.900 --> 51:44.400
I'll just stick myself
a few times in the arm with a shiv,

51:44.500 --> 51:45.400
call it self-defense.

51:45.500 --> 51:46.600
I don't know.

51:46.700 --> 51:50.600
What if we just get him out of here
with a stern warning?

51:52.400 --> 51:55.500
You're the boss.

51:55.600 --> 52:00.100
Look, I want you and your fellow squatters
to get the hell out of here

52:00.200 --> 52:02.100
and stay the hell away from our house.

52:02.200 --> 52:04.300
And if I see you back here again,

52:04.400 --> 52:07.300
you sure as hell better have a pair of tits.

52:07.400 --> 52:09.600
Big ones.
Double D.

52:16.300 --> 52:20.800
Hi. I'm Brian Trolet.
The "T" is silent.

52:20.900 --> 52:22.900
What's your name?

52:23.000 --> 52:24.700
I'm Amber, Amber Waves.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.200
And this is my partner...

52:27.900 --> 52:29.300
Cherry Red.

52:29.400 --> 52:30.800
What do you do?

52:30.900 --> 52:34.800
I'm in adult films and so is she.

52:34.900 --> 52:38.100
I saw an adult film once.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.900
My father has them.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.700
He hides them in a box labeled "poison. "

52:44.200 --> 52:45.500
Wait a minute.

52:45.600 --> 52:47.000
There's nothing wrong with nudity.

52:48.300 --> 52:49.700
- Really?
- No.

52:49.800 --> 52:51.800
- It's natural.
- It is?

52:51.900 --> 52:54.300
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

52:54.400 --> 52:57.000
Well, if it's natural, do you think...

52:57.200 --> 52:59.800
Am I allowed to see your breasts?

52:59.900 --> 53:02.300
Well, yeah!

53:02.400 --> 53:04.000
Yeah?

53:05.300 --> 53:06.200
Watch it, stretched.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.200
I missed it.

53:13.300 --> 53:15.200
Save me dance?

53:15.300 --> 53:17.800
I missed it.

53:32.400 --> 53:36.000
Oh, Jesus, Craig.

53:37.700 --> 53:40.800
Two and a half more people are dead.

53:40.900 --> 53:42.200
Do you know what this means?

53:42.300 --> 53:45.100
Yeah.

53:45.200 --> 53:48.200
There goes any shot of
the Meet the Knockers sequel.

53:48.300 --> 53:55.800
That, and this is just another
completely random freak party accident.

53:55.900 --> 53:58.900
Again... it's like we're on the same page.

53:59.100 --> 54:00.200
What are the chances?

54:00.300 --> 54:01.900
Every time.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.400
So, Craig, what do we do
with these bodies?

54:15.000 --> 54:18.100
I actually do a silly little
Bruce Willis impersonation.

54:18.200 --> 54:19.600
- You know, because...
- Give me a break.

54:19.700 --> 54:21.400
No, it's true.
It's really great.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.700
Because it's all in... it's all in the mouth.

54:23.800 --> 54:26.200
You know, he's got
this little scowl, and he's like...

54:26.300 --> 54:27.600
You know, he's like...

54:27.700 --> 54:28.800
Let's see.

54:28.900 --> 54:32.900
He's like, Hans.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.900
Hans, that's a...

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
that's a tricky little accent there, Hans.

54:38.200 --> 54:41.000
You should be on TV with that accent, Hans.

54:42.800 --> 54:44.200
Hey.

54:44.300 --> 54:45.900
You okay?

54:46.000 --> 54:48.800
Hey, you...

54:52.700 --> 54:54.200
Joey...

54:54.300 --> 54:57.300
Joe...

55:00.300 --> 55:01.700
Hans.

55:03.900 --> 55:07.400
What are you going to do
with the detonators, Hans, hmm?

55:07.500 --> 55:11.100
What do you think, I'm stupid, Hans?

55:11.200 --> 55:12.500
Yippee-ki-yay, mother...

55:22.600 --> 55:24.100
What the...

55:27.600 --> 55:29.000
Hey! Father Patrick, how's it going?

55:29.000 --> 55:30.300
Hey! Father Patrick, how's it going?

55:30.400 --> 55:32.100
It's Brother Backwater.

55:32.200 --> 55:34.200
Yeah.

55:34.300 --> 55:36.000
Yes, I know it's late.

55:36.100 --> 55:37.500
I'm sorry to get you up.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.100
I'm feeling a little...

55:40.200 --> 55:43.200
a little thirsty right now.

55:43.300 --> 55:45.500
Like I could use a drink.

55:45.600 --> 55:46.600
Yeah, you know.

55:46.700 --> 55:49.800
I went to a party and, you know...

55:49.900 --> 55:53.100
Yeah, yeah, I know I'm not supposed to go
to parties but I went to one

55:53.200 --> 55:55.000
because I thought
if I could go to one party,

55:55.100 --> 55:56.500
face my demons once and for all,

55:56.600 --> 55:57.700
then I would prove to myself

55:57.800 --> 56:00.200
that I was worthy of serving the Lord.

56:00.300 --> 56:03.300
And it was going really well.
It was going very well.

56:03.400 --> 56:05.000
I was kicking ass out there.

56:05.100 --> 56:07.300
I think I even suckered
a couple converts out there.

56:07.400 --> 56:09.200
It was...

56:09.300 --> 56:11.300
I don't know if they were rich kids.

56:11.400 --> 56:12.900
They were very well dressed.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.300
Father, I... Come on, Father,
listen to me here, okay?

56:15.400 --> 56:16.900
I'm just trying to tell you that I'm...

56:17.000 --> 56:18.500
There's...

56:18.700 --> 56:22.200
There's a lot of weird stuff
going on at this party.

56:22.300 --> 56:24.300
There's a lot of very weird stuff
going on out there

56:24.400 --> 56:26.200
and I don't think I'm going to make it.

56:26.300 --> 56:29.300
I don't think I'm going to make it.

56:29.400 --> 56:32.000
Father, what I need
is your help right now.

56:32.100 --> 56:34.800
I need you to turn off
the goddamn television

56:34.900 --> 56:35.900
and give me a little help.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.700
My spiritual salvation is on the line.

56:44.700 --> 56:45.700
Hey, Padre.

56:49.100 --> 56:51.800
Father, uh...

56:51.900 --> 56:54.300
I'm going to have to call you back.

57:12.800 --> 57:15.400
I can't believe this is happening.

57:15.500 --> 57:19.000
I don't believe my eyes.

57:19.200 --> 57:23.200
Joey Lawrence came to our party!

57:24.900 --> 57:26.800
- You got it?
- Yeah.

57:26.900 --> 57:29.300
- Excuse us.
- Oh, my God, it's the guy from Blossoml

57:29.400 --> 57:31.000
- Hey, no, no, no. Later. Later?
- Going this way.

57:31.100 --> 57:32.100
Call me.

57:32.200 --> 57:33.200
Okay, okay.
Guys, guys.

57:33.300 --> 57:35.200
- Call me.
- Okay, later.

57:35.300 --> 57:36.600
We got it.

57:38.400 --> 57:40.000
All right, around the table here.

57:40.100 --> 57:42.500
- What are you, eating?
- Comfort food.

57:42.600 --> 57:44.800
- Dude, is this party bitchin' or what?
- Shit.

57:44.900 --> 57:45.900
Oh, my God.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.300
Hey.

57:48.400 --> 57:49.800
Is that Joey Lawrence?

57:49.900 --> 57:52.400
Well, we were actually
just heading outside.

57:52.600 --> 57:54.500
I mean, I knew this party was good,

57:54.700 --> 57:56.000
but it just went A-list!

57:56.100 --> 57:59.000
Yeah, that's... It's totally killer.

57:59.100 --> 58:01.600
It's one they'll never forget.

58:01.700 --> 58:02.900
Joey...

58:03.000 --> 58:04.300
can you just, you know...

58:04.400 --> 58:06.800
just give me a little sip
of the whole "whoa" juice?

58:11.500 --> 58:13.300
Joey got a little crazy with the Cuervo.

58:14.800 --> 58:17.300
We're just going to take him by the pool

58:17.400 --> 58:18.500
for some, you know, fresh air.

58:18.600 --> 58:20.100
I'll go with you!

58:20.200 --> 58:21.800
Just let me grab a beer.

58:22.900 --> 58:26.000
Oh, my God.

58:26.100 --> 58:28.200
Someone drank all our good beer!

58:28.400 --> 58:30.400
Could this night possibly get any worse?

58:30.600 --> 58:32.100
Top shelf!
Top shelf!

58:32.200 --> 58:34.000
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, that one had to hurt.

58:35.100 --> 58:36.900
What is the matter with you?

58:37.000 --> 58:40.800
There are two severed heads
in our refrigerator.

58:40.900 --> 58:42.600
Okay, all right.

58:42.700 --> 58:44.700
There's no reason for hysterics.

58:44.800 --> 58:48.900
I mean, it's just two more
completely random...

58:49.000 --> 58:51.200
- Unrelated!
- Accidental deaths.

58:51.300 --> 58:53.000
What? Accident...
What are you...

58:53.100 --> 58:54.900
Come on, man!
Shit happens!

58:55.000 --> 58:56.100
- All the time.
- Wait, wait.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.200
Two more?

58:57.300 --> 58:59.400
Okay, um, look.

58:59.600 --> 59:03.500
We weren't going
to tell you this until after...

59:03.700 --> 59:06.200
...we got sexed.

59:06.300 --> 59:12.200
But there is something
very strange going on here.

59:12.300 --> 59:14.900
Eight people died.
Make that nine.

59:15.900 --> 59:17.200
Joey Lawrence is dead.

59:17.300 --> 59:20.500
Tonight Hollywood lost one of its treasures.

59:20.600 --> 59:23.500
Wait, nine people died?

59:23.600 --> 59:25.900
Here? Tonight?

59:26.000 --> 59:27.100
Yeah.

59:27.200 --> 59:29.800
And some thoughtless bastard
clogged our toilet.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.100
Yeah, but, hey, don't worry, okay?

59:32.300 --> 59:35.700
Hey, hey, we got it
under control, all right?

59:35.900 --> 59:39.600
It's just two more, you know,
accidental party deaths.

59:39.700 --> 59:40.900
What... Accidental deaths?

59:41.000 --> 59:42.900
These people were murdered!

59:43.000 --> 59:44.100
- What?
- What?

59:44.200 --> 59:47.600
We have got squatters inside the wire.

59:47.700 --> 59:49.000
I'm calling the cops.

59:49.100 --> 59:51.200
No, wait, wait!
Just wait, man.

59:51.300 --> 59:53.200
Are you insane?

59:53.300 --> 59:54.600
We can't call the cops!

59:54.700 --> 59:56.000
I mean, okay.

59:56.100 --> 59:57.700
Uh, murder.

59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.300
Yes, it's a big deal,

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.800
but, I mean, if we lose the house,

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.300
you'll totally blow any shot
that you've got with Lucy.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.100
Okay, maybe I got a little carried away.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.100
It's understandable.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.400
I mean, you got
two human heads in the fridge.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.800
I mean, these people are dead,

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.000
and that's tragic, for sure.

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:26.000
But there's nothing we can
do about it now, right?

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:28.100
We will call the cops in the morning,

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.400
after we've got all this place cleaned up.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.700
But for now, we've got to stop

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.700
these blood-thirsty squatters on our own.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.500
For all we know,

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.400
they may still be in this house.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.900
So we've go to be vigilant
and keep our eyes open.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.500
If we look hard enough,

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.600
we're bound to see someone
who looks suspicious.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.200
Oh, my God!

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.800
It's the squatter!

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.800
Joe, put that away.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.800
Now, look, friend.

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.700
We can either do this the easy way

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.500
or we can do this the hard way.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.000
Tell us what we need to know, wo... man.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.100
And one more word about
that freakin' hot sauce...

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.500
Tough guy, huh?

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.600
Boys?

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.400
No.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.700
Open up. Say "ah. "

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.800
Open up and say...

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:36.500
I got a good one!

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.500
I love my job.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.500
Look!

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.100
We know that before we moved in

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.100
you and your friends were living secretly
down in the basement.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.400
Squatting, if you will.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.800
But this is our house now.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.800
So why are you still here?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:53.900
- Again!
- Again!

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.700
Hey, look!
It's Delilah and Jez!

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.700
Oh, I think they're going to do that geek.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.100
They must have used us to get to him!

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.600
It's been Delilah and Jez this whole time.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.200
- Why?
- Wait.

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.100
Delilah and Jez are Lucy's best friends.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.400
You guys...

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.100
that can only mean one thing!

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.500
Oh, no.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.400
- Lucy's in danger!
- Exactly!

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.900
I'm going to save her!

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.700
Lucy, I gotta talk to you about something.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.200
Brody...

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.300
would you wear this for me?

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.700
Absolutely.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.400
Just got a little bit
of the goosebumps there.

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.900
So what did you want
to talk to me about?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.100
Oh, right.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.000
Lucy, have you ever noticed anything strange

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:19.400
about your friends Delilah and Jez?

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.800
No. Why do you ask?

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.300
Well, let me first say

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.100
that just because
they're your best friends,

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.100
that doesn't mean I think
you're anything like them.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.600
I mean, I know that you are good
and kind and innocent.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.100
Wow, that's really...

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.300
You were saying?

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.400
How do I say this?

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.100
Delilah and Jez... are minion of the devil.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.700
Oh, my, that's awful.

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.100
Yeah, I know.
But that's not it.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.300
This house is actually a portal to hell,

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.300
and they're devouring souls
to feed to their master.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.200
I'd rather devour something else.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.600
Oh, my God.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.700
God's not going to help you now, Brody.

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.700
I hope not.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.800
Wow! You have really sharp nails.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:12.100
Lucy, I gotta say,

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.500
there is something about you, you know?

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.800
I've never felt this way
about anybody before.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.100
You just have this great...

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.800
I don't know, this great spirit
about you, you know?

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.900
You're just really special.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
You've got these horns...

01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.500
Horns!

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.500
Wings!

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.200
Oh, my God!

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.500
Brody, come on.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.000
You got a penis!

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:35.800
I've got a vagina, too.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.200
Brody, please.

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.400
You're the devil her... him...

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.900
her... himself!

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.900
You know, I thought I sensed an accent.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.800
I speak all the languages, baby.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.300
Delilah and Jez are... are your minion!

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.600
You're the Antichrist.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:08.400
And you've been killing
innocent party-goers all night long.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.000
I had to.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.700
I mean, that's what I do!

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800
I'm Satan!

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.700
I lie and screw people over.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.600
You used me.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.500
Well, yeah.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.700
You bitch.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.200
Brody, why don't you join me?

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:29.000
I'll give you everything you've ever wanted:

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:33.500
Money, power, eternal life!

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.800
Plus, we can throw a party
like this every night.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.400
Does sound kinda good, you know?

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.000
Partying every night.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.000
Wait, what am I talking about?

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.500
You've got a penis!

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.300
Details.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.900
Guys!

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.800
Guys, what are you doing?

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.300
Hey, boys, wanna party?

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.800
Boys, save yourselves!

01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:58.900
Lucy's the devil!

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.900
I don't even care.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.100
Let me offer some words of persuasion.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.700
She has a penis.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.600
Holy camel foot!

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.000
Yeah.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:15.400
- Deal-breaker!
- Hey, move it!

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.900
What are we going to do?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.300
He had a penis!

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.500
Brody, what are you... Focus!

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.800
My nana warned me about
these creepy L.A. People!

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.000
There's got to be somebody here

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.100
that knows how to battle the powers of evil.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:40.100
I am a golden god...

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.800
Flying squirrel!

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:56.300
- Backwater!
- Oh, my God!

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.600
We should never have dared him!

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:06.200
Oh, Preston, baby.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.600
That was awesome.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:12.500
Catholic school girls are evil.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.000
Get Backwater inside and sober him up.

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.700
I'm going to save some lives.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.000
It's an emergency, man.

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.700
Hello again.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:41.600
Look, I need everyone here
to listen to me very, very carefully.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.900
But whatever you do,
please do not panic.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.200
Everybody here is in danger
of being brutally murdered

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:49.900
and sacrificed to the devil.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.400
So, if you would, please just move
single file to the door,

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.200
and we'll look forward
to seeing you next time.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:56.700
Show us your tits!

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:03.900
Hell, no, we won't go.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:20.500
Everybody, run!

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.700
Run!
Everybody out!

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:49.300
Last chance.

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.399
Come on, man!
You gotta wake up!

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.800
- Come on, bro.
- You're our only hope!

01:08:57.899 --> 01:08:59.899
Come on, wake up!
Wake up!

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.200
- How's it coming?
- I don't know!

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.399
Maybe we need some more coffee!

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:04.800
I'm on it.
I'm on it!

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:06.899
Back up, hot little thing.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.000
Was that decaf?

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.500
Oh. My bad.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.100
- That one's on me.
- Yeah.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:23.700
Come on, boy!
Ride 'em, boy!

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.899
It's Backwater's Bible.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.800
This thing is, like,
the official textbook for fighting evil!

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.200
Ballsy, you are brilliant!

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.700
Who's my dog?

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.300
I think I found it: The Book of Psalms.

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:44.899
"And he who praises the Lord
through the glory of song

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.200
shall be saved and fear no evil. "

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:51.300
Come on, you guys, put it together.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:57.300
We will sing a holy song
to defeat those evil... hot...

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.400
evil bitches!

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.100
Yes. Yes!

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:26.200
Hey! They're singing a holy song
to defeat us hot, evil bitches!

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.500
Child?

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.900
I don't know the song.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.400
Get him!

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500
Can I get you ladies a beverage?

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.200
Hey, fatty!

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:31.400
Keep it.
Keep it.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.500
No, please!

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.800
Not really thirsty or...

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.900
Holy shit.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.800
Sing it one time!

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.100
Come on!

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:04.500
Sing it with me, children!

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.600
They're bonding together.

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:15.400
And the show has unity
and human kindness.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.200
Send these Satanic bitches
into their soul hole.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.300
And now we're going to send
you evil hos back to hell!

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:31.900
That's hot!
That's hot!

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.100
Come on!

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:37.900
Oh, yeah, bitch.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.900
Your soul is mine.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.600
My balls.

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.000
And vagina.

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.300
Please, don't destroy me.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.800
Do me.

01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:53.300
Don't do it, Brody!

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.200
She is still pretty hot.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.400
Whoa, your head, bro!

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:15.000
Awesome, dude.

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:23.200
That was one killer party, dude.

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:27.000
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.400
I knew you were a dirty boy.

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:01.600
Come on, girls.

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:03.500
Let's leave this whack devil house.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.700
This ain't even evil.
You want to see evil?

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.200
- Yeah, baby, show me evil.
- I'll show you evil.

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:10.400
Wait till we get to my mom's house.

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.200
Yeah, you can't handle my evil lovin'.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.600
You'd be like,
"Oh, MC Baby Chuggy-Thug,

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.900
your lovin' is too much for me!"

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.300
Then I'll get on the microphone

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.400
and rap to you so pimpaliciously,

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.900
you'll have an eargasm for a millennia.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.900
Then we're going to hop onto my private jet

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.800
and we going to Rome for some biscotti

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:28.700
and some espresso, bitches!

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.900
Let's go! Give me some room.
Give me some room.

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.400
Check it out.

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.500
We got you a little something.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.700
El Diablol

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.100
Now we can use that spice up
our mother's marinara.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.300
Then we'll do a little fiesta,

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.500
and afterwards, we clean you up,

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.100
you'll look like Antonio Banderas.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.500
Hasta la vista, boys.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.600
Ciao.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.300
Backwater, we know we let you down.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.600
Yeah. Sorry, man.

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:06.100
I know your spiritual
salvation was on the line.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.600
You going to be okay?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I think I'll be fine.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.400
- Yeah.
- Hot party, boys.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.700
We'll see you next time.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:38.300
Well, that's it.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.700
All the stiffs have come back to life

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.600
and everybody's going home.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:43.600
Yeah.

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.700
Including us.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.600
My dad's balls are enormous.

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:53.000
They're like cantaloupes in a tube sock.

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:10.900
Fuck!

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.600
Where your house go?

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:13.600
Winnie?

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:15.400
What are you doing here?

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.800
I come to see how
you like your new pad.

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.300
Where it go?

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:24.000
Well...

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.500
we're not really sure.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.200
No problem.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.300
I like you boys, especially you, Softie.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.500
Winnie help you find you a new pad.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.000
You just invite Winnie
to the housewarming party.

01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:39.100
Of course!

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.600
Yeah! Consider yourself officially invited!

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.600
Yeah, you can come
to all of our parties!

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:46.100
Come on, boys!
Winnie buy you breakfast.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.800
You're so cute.
Shotgun.

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:53.300
Hello, Softie.
How are you?

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:56.300
Hey, where've you been, buddy?

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.100
Ballsy, come on.
Let's go!

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.200
This nice lady,

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.700
she's going to buy us a new house.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.500
And she's going to take us to breakfast.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.600
Sausage links!

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.500
Buckle up, boys.

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:28.400
- So, you're familiar with Tobey Maguire, right?
- Right.

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:29.600
You know the movies he was in,

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:30.800
like Spider-Man,
Seabiscuit, stuff like that?

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.200
- Whatever, yeah.
- All right, so look.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.700
He's not really cool
with meeting new people.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.500
So when you meet him,
just talk about his movies.

01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:37.300
Talk about his movies,
but not the movies

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.200
that no one saw,
like Pleasantville and stuff.

01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:40.300
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.200
Oh, and, um, don't make
direct eye-contact

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:44.500
because he doesn't like
to meet anybody for the first time

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.800
and look him directly in the eye...

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.100
- Right, and that's...
- What?

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.700
- I mean, how's that possible?
- What are you talking about?

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.700
- Man, look at... Just go.
- I'm sorry. Shit, my bad.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.100
It's going to be cool
because he doesn't like

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.800
anybody taller than him,
so you're going to be perfect.

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.800
- That's perfect.
- Yeah.
