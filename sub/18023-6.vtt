WEBVTT

00:06.089 --> 00:07.214
All right,
we got it all?

00:07.257 --> 00:08.382
I think we did.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.009
What are you making
for dinner tonight?

00:10.051 --> 00:10.926
>> I don't know.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.553
I was thinking
about hot dogs.

00:12.595 --> 00:13.679
Remember we use
to eat hot dogs.

00:13.722 --> 00:14.596
Hello.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.390
>> All right.
Let's check out.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.810
Is that Si in
the in the grocery shirt?

00:19.853 --> 00:20.728
What's he
doing here?

00:20.770 --> 00:21.895
Thank you
so much.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.230
Look, thank you
for shopping with us.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.733
Hey.

00:25.775 --> 00:26.900
>> What are you doing?

00:26.943 --> 00:28.235
>> What's it look
like I'm doing?

00:28.278 --> 00:29.403
I'm packing groceries.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.446
>> Are you working here?

00:30.488 --> 00:31.572
>> Yeah, part-time.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.240
>> Willie, did you fire Si?

00:33.283 --> 00:34.491
>> No, I didn't fire Si.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.744
>> Look, hey, bagging
groceries is always

00:36.786 --> 00:37.953
been my dream job,

00:37.996 --> 00:39.413
but before that
could happen,

00:39.456 --> 00:41.248
Uncle Sam pointed
his finger at me and said,

00:41.291 --> 00:43.584
" Hey, I want you to
go serve this country."

00:43.626 --> 00:45.419
Plus, hey,
it's my dream job.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.754
>> This is your
dream job?

00:46.796 --> 00:48.005
>> When I came back,

00:48.048 --> 00:49.923
I ended up getting a job
with Duck Commander.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.259
But look, I still
wanted to be bagging.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.761
Hey, it's a fun job.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.430
I meet a lot of interesting
and nice people.

00:56.473 --> 00:57.681
Like ya'll.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.349
>> You-you know
us, Si.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.601
>> Si, you're my uncle.

01:00.643 --> 01:01.935
>> Look, they say
you can't teach an

01:01.978 --> 01:04.271
old dog new tricks...
Paper or plastic?

01:04.314 --> 01:05.314
>> Plastic of course.

01:05.356 --> 01:07.107
>> No, you want
paper, sir.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.443
That's because, hey,
he's a dog, okay.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.819
Look, I'm a human being.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.780
>> You asked me which
on I wanted and that-

01:12.822 --> 01:14.031
>> Trust me.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.783
Hey, trust me when I tell you,
you want paper.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.785
But hey,
I still am old.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.411
>> Si, be careful
with those eggs.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.454
>> Okay.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.747
>> Si, uh, okay.
I don't-

01:21.790 --> 01:23.123
Don't put the eggs
at the bottom.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.292
>> I need a cart
on aisle two.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.460
Oh my gosh.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.461
>> I got his, okay.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.254
>> Si.
Si, Si, Si.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.464
>> What?

01:30.507 --> 01:31.799
>> When it comes to Si,

01:31.841 --> 01:33.342
you can always expect
the unexpected.

01:33.384 --> 01:36.553
But this is unexpectedly
unexpected.

01:36.596 --> 01:37.554
>> Cream cheese?

01:37.597 --> 01:38.680
Good grief, son.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.432
You're buying enough
cream cheese here,

01:40.475 --> 01:42.267
you can start your
own factory.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.686
>> It's also surprisingly
insulting.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.647
>> We're gonna need
another shopping cart.

01:46.689 --> 01:47.815
Big shopper here.

01:47.857 --> 01:48.816
Si!

01:48.858 --> 01:51.401
>> A heavy shopper,
I should say.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.861
>> There really only
two things you can't

01:52.904 --> 01:54.530
do as grocery bagger.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.490
Put the eggs on
the bottom of the bag,

01:56.533 --> 01:58.367
and tell fat jokes.

01:58.409 --> 02:01.328
I can't emphasize no
fat jokes enough.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.704
Thank you, Melodie.
>> You're so welcome.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.790
Well sir, I hope you
enjoyed shopping with us.

02:04.833 --> 02:05.791
>> We'll talk about
this tomorrow.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.000
>> All right, let me
go ahead and

02:07.043 --> 02:08.001
walk you out to
your car, sir.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.253
>> Si, I didn't need
your help.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.295
>> What do you mean
you don't need my help?

02:10.338 --> 02:12.131
>> Willie.
He's doing a good job.

02:12.173 --> 02:12.965
I don't need
your help.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.049
>> Si!

02:14.092 --> 02:15.384
Hey, get off
your horn.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.023
Is Si not
here yet?

02:30.066 --> 02:30.983
No.

02:31.025 --> 02:31.692
He ain't been here
all morning.

02:31.734 --> 02:32.818
Why?

02:32.861 --> 02:35.028
>> I have got the
story of all stories.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.113
>> Well, what happened
to him?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.365
>> Well, guess what
I saw yesterday.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.241
>> What?

02:39.284 --> 02:42.035
>> One, Mr. Si Robertson,

02:42.078 --> 02:44.705
bagging groceries
at the grocery store.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.166
>> His own groceries
or somebody else's?

02:47.208 --> 02:48.417
>> He bagged my groceries.

02:48.459 --> 02:50.377
Why did he
choose grocery bagging?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.337
>> Well, he is
a strange guy.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.840
>> What are you doing
in my seat?

02:54.883 --> 02:57.092
>> You weren't here.
I didn't-

02:57.135 --> 02:58.302
What, were you
watching Bagger Vance

02:58.344 --> 02:59.511
or something?

02:59.554 --> 03:01.221
Were you watching movies?

03:02.473 --> 03:03.599
Bilbo Baggins.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.059
Hey, don't
listen to what they say,

03:06.102 --> 03:07.895
Bag-atha Christie.
It's cool.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.396
>> Ya'll a bunch
of idiots anyway.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.899
Look, these stupid idiots,
they're just jealous,

03:11.941 --> 03:14.359
because none of them ever
followed their dreams.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.862
>> Would that make
your wife the bag lady?

03:16.905 --> 03:19.156
>> Yeah, okay.
That's real funny.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.159
Look, hey, any idiot can
sit here making jokes.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.577
What's my favorite
kind of bread?

03:23.620 --> 03:24.745
Bag-it.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.496
Where am I gonna go
on vacation next year?

03:26.539 --> 03:27.748
Bag-dad.

03:27.790 --> 03:28.957
Who's my favorite actor?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.251
Ed Bag-ley of course.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.502
>> Si, if you were
a boxer,

03:32.545 --> 03:34.922
you'd be
Marvelous Marvin Bag-ler.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.632
>> Okay, fat boy
there has the let the

03:36.674 --> 03:38.217
cat out of the bag, huh?

03:42.180 --> 03:44.431
>> Look, when it's
double coupon day,

03:44.474 --> 03:46.892
and the conveyer belt
is baring down on you...

03:46.935 --> 03:49.311
Hey, it's no laughing
matter, boys.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.396
Bagging groceries
is a science.

03:51.439 --> 03:54.274
Plus, you can learn
a lot about people.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.860
Take fat boy there
for example, okay.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.070
He comes up there,

03:58.112 --> 03:59.529
he's got three shopping
carts, all right.

03:59.572 --> 04:03.867
The last one is full of
nothing but cream cheese.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.202
>> It wasn't three
shopping carts.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.578
Tell me-
Yeah, yeah

04:06.621 --> 04:07.621
>> It was that much cream-

04:07.664 --> 04:09.289
You need to go
back to work.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.582
>> Yeah.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.960
Well, now that you've
got out my chair, I will.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.128
>> I mean, I always though
that bagging groceries

04:15.171 --> 04:18.799
was something that
any person could do.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.467
>> Bonk!
Wrong!

04:20.510 --> 04:21.969
It's also a sport.

04:22.011 --> 04:22.886
>> Huh?

04:22.929 --> 04:24.096
>> As a matter of fact,

04:24.138 --> 04:26.139
they've got a competition
coming up, okay.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.975
To find out who's
the fastest and most

04:28.017 --> 04:29.476
efficient bagger is.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.144
And I'm gonna win
that sucker too.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.562
>> I'll take bets on that.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.147
>> Hey, ya'll don't
understand.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.649
I'm gonna go
bathroom break.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.317
I'll be back in
a few minutes.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.819
>> All right.
See you, bagman.

04:38.861 --> 04:39.903
>> Mmm hmm.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.196
So what time we going
to Brookshire's?

04:41.239 --> 04:42.531
>> As soon as
we get off here.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.785
I'm gonna go
buy the heaviest

04:46.828 --> 04:47.995
thing they got.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.834
You know,
at Meemaw Kay's table,

04:53.876 --> 04:55.836
we never have
phones out.

04:55.878 --> 04:56.878
Remember?

04:56.921 --> 04:58.046
Phones up.
Phones up, kids.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.840
It's a rule.
It's a rule.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.508
>> Will, how was
the dance you went to?

05:01.551 --> 05:02.884
Were you impressing
the ladies with

05:02.927 --> 05:04.177
your dance moves?

05:04.220 --> 05:05.512
>> I feel like I was.

05:05.555 --> 05:06.847
>> Do you have a
signature dance or?

05:06.889 --> 05:07.848
>> Oh yeah.

05:07.890 --> 05:08.974
What was your dance
of the night?

05:09.017 --> 05:11.143
>> "The Quan."

05:11.185 --> 05:13.353
And "Whip the Nay-Nay."

05:13.396 --> 05:16.148
>> ¶ The whip ¶
>> I've never heard of these.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.693
What's wrong?

05:19.736 --> 05:20.819
>> What's up?

05:22.196 --> 05:23.488
>> Are you okay?

05:23.531 --> 05:25.532
>> What happened?

05:25.575 --> 05:26.908
Are you about to
puke or something.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.285
Ew.
Are you okay?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.703
>> I just broke
half my tooth off.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.954
>> You broke half
your tooth?

05:30.997 --> 05:31.830
>> No you didn't.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.707
>> Yea, that's it,
right there.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.542
>> Oh my god,
you really did.

05:35.585 --> 05:36.668
>> Disgusting.

05:36.711 --> 05:37.878
>> It's cause you're
a terrible eater.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.546
>> You have to go
to the dentist.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.214
>> I don' like going
to the dentist.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.841
>> Are you scared
of the dentist?

05:43.843 --> 05:44.926
>> I'm not scared
of dentists.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.720
They're good friendly
people who provide

05:46.763 --> 05:47.971
a valuable service.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.556
>> I have never seen you,
in my whole life,

05:49.599 --> 05:50.849
got to the dentist.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.768
>> But I'm slightly
scared of the extreme

05:52.810 --> 05:54.770
pain that dentists
can cause.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.313
>> One time he cried.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.773
>> I didn't cry
at the dentist.

05:57.815 --> 06:00.317
>> Oh yeah, your eyes
were just watery.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.694
>> It's kind of like how,
I'm not scared of cars,

06:02.737 --> 06:04.654
but I wouldn't wanna
get run over by one.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.281
>> And then,
he punched the

06:06.324 --> 06:07.657
dentist right in
the face.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.784
>> Okay!

06:08.826 --> 06:10.035
It was like thirty
years ago, all right.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.578
>> Well, did it happen?

06:11.621 --> 06:13.413
>> I mean, that damage
is already done.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.831
It's not like I
even need to go to

06:14.874 --> 06:17.084
the dentist at
this point.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.752
>> Well, you're going
to the dentist.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.128
>> I'm not taking him.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.755
>> I'm not going
to the dentist.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.090
>> I'm telling mom.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.633
Don't tell mom.

06:24.675 --> 06:28.637
>> Go to the dentist.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.437
That's bad for
there, young lady.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.605
Especially that
mac n' cheese.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.981
What?

06:40.024 --> 06:41.191
>> All right, now we're
getting to the good stuff.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.275
Green beans--

06:42.318 --> 06:43.860
>> Come on, Si.
We're backing up here.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.445
Lookie here.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.115
I see him.
Man!

06:48.157 --> 06:50.534
Is this it?

06:50.576 --> 06:51.785
>> What are you
idiots doing here?

06:53.329 --> 06:55.497
>> Si, I just had to see
it for myself.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.124
>> Look,
last time I noticed,

06:57.166 --> 06:59.209
ya'll was making
fun of me at the shop.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.128
Hey, ya'll can leave,
all right.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.212
I'm working.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.005
Look, these idiots
don't any respect

07:04.048 --> 07:06.299
for a professional bagman.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.635
Look, the whole
bagging game, okay...

07:08.678 --> 07:11.638
Hey, it's built on
laser focus.

07:11.681 --> 07:12.639
Hey, slow down,

07:12.682 --> 07:13.807
you're gonna dent
that can.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.225
>> Hey, don't squash
that chicken.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.144
>> Don't be squashing
that chicken.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.437
>> Look, do I sit
there and crack jokes

07:18.479 --> 07:21.189
while there working
at their job?

07:21.232 --> 07:22.190
Of course I do, okay.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.443
Because my jokes
are funny.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.486
Si, can I talk
to you for a minute.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.696
Si, you're in trouble.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.156
>> Look, these guys,
I'm telling you,

07:29.198 --> 07:30.824
they're like
a paper bag...

07:30.867 --> 07:32.033
they won't come open.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.493
They're annoying
to me, okay.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.828
They're slowing
me down.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.998
All right, and look,
I wanna shake 'em, okay.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.375
Till they stop
aggravating me.

07:42.753 --> 07:43.837
What's that- what
you got on your mind.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.672
Well Si, it's
not working out.

07:45.715 --> 07:46.756
>> What do you mean?

07:46.799 --> 07:48.049
>> Uh, you still
bagging poorly,

07:48.092 --> 07:50.343
you broke over thirty
dollars worth of product,

07:50.386 --> 07:52.053
you're yelling across
the front-end,

07:52.096 --> 07:53.847
you got people hanging
out in the store-

07:53.890 --> 07:54.681
>> Hey!

07:54.724 --> 07:55.849
I don't know
these idiots.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.184
>> Si, I'm going to
have to let you go.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.518
>> Well, hey look,

07:58.561 --> 08:00.187
I'm still in for the
bagging competition, right?

08:00.229 --> 08:02.481
>> No, that's not
going to work either.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.857
Nice working with
you though.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.692
Superman.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.818
>> All right Leon, me-

08:06.861 --> 08:08.195
me and you are still
good, man.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.530
Hey, send me a bill for
that stuff that I owe you.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.198
>> You just got fired?

08:11.240 --> 08:12.616
>> Yeah I got fired.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.575
Did you really?

08:13.618 --> 08:15.118
Because of
you knuckleheads.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.495
>> Hey.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.997
I wanted to that
bagging competition, son.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.082
But I can't now.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.293
My bad on that.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.176
>> Cookies are ready!
Whoop! Whoop!

08:31.219 --> 08:32.636
Oh, yum.

08:32.678 --> 08:33.720
I got ice cream.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.846
Ooh.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.766
>> Hey, finish your-
Polynesian stuff.

08:37.808 --> 08:38.975
>> Polynomials.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.227
Willie.
>> What?

08:40.269 --> 08:41.436
>> What kind of ice
cream do you want?

08:41.479 --> 08:42.604
>> I think I'm good.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.064
>> You don't
want ice cream?

08:44.106 --> 08:45.440
Have you lost
your mind?

08:45.483 --> 08:46.525
>> I'm good.

08:46.567 --> 08:47.692
I just- I ain't
feeling it tonight.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.569
>> I know why he doesn't
want to eat any.

08:49.612 --> 08:50.570
>> Why?

08:50.613 --> 08:52.656
>> Today,
at the Duck Diner,

08:52.698 --> 08:55.659
Dad chipped his tooth
while eating duck legs.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.702
>> What?
You chipped your tooth?

08:57.745 --> 08:59.037
Well Willie, you gottta
go to the dentist,

08:59.080 --> 09:00.413
you can't just leave
it like that.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.581
>> I don't need to go
to the dentist.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.707
Why would I go
to the dentist?

09:02.750 --> 09:04.125
>> Because you have
chipped tooth,

09:04.168 --> 09:05.752
and you're not eating
because of it.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.128
He's scared
of the dentist.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.088
Shut up.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.297
>> Well, I'm sorry.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.590
>> You're not still scared
of the dentist?

09:10.633 --> 09:12.425
>> Bearded men
can be scared.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.052
>> I'm not scared
of the dentist.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.221
Now that Korie knows
I have a broken tooth,

09:16.264 --> 09:18.890
there's not turning back
from a trip to the dentist.

09:18.933 --> 09:19.975
>> I'll call the dentist.

09:20.017 --> 09:20.934
I gotta take Bella
to get her braces

09:20.977 --> 09:21.726
off in the morning.

09:21.769 --> 09:22.602
>> Whoop, whoop!

09:22.645 --> 09:23.770
>> So right after that,

09:23.813 --> 09:24.854
we can just stop by
Dr. Finland's office.

09:24.897 --> 09:25.772
>> I'm not sure,
I may have something

09:25.815 --> 09:27.107
to do tomorrow,
I don't know.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.984
>> You have nothing
to do tomorrow.

09:29.026 --> 09:31.236
>> I really have no
other option at this point,

09:31.279 --> 09:33.446
but to suck it up
and take it like a man.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.615
>> Bella's not scared
to take her braces off.

09:35.658 --> 09:36.700
>> That doesn't
even hurt.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.703
Or I could pack my
bags and run away.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.204
I'll sleep on it.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.789
>> Okay, if I go
to the dentist,

09:42.832 --> 09:44.124
you have to go too.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.458
Deal.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.460
>> That was more of
a deal for dad to make.

09:47.503 --> 09:48.336
I thought
we were-

09:48.379 --> 09:50.130
I'm makin
the deal.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.923
It'll be like a
daddy-daughter date.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.133
>> How sweet.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.302
>> With drills, super pain
and drugs.

09:56.470 --> 09:57.762
That's not a
daddy-daughter date.

09:57.805 --> 09:58.805
They give
you the drugs

09:58.848 --> 10:00.140
so you won't
lhave pain.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.141
>> Yeah, they just put some
shots in your mouth.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.642
You'll be fine.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.145
Don't worry, babe,
I'll hold your hand.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.646
I'll hold
your hand too.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.822
Jep, what is this?

10:15.865 --> 10:17.240
This is for Si.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.618
I'm gonna make him
a good bagger.

10:19.660 --> 10:20.535
>> He got fired.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.870
He's out of
the competition.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.204
>> I realized that.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.498
So that's why I'm setting up
another competition.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.542
We're gonna help him,

10:27.585 --> 10:28.543
and he's gonna
be a good bagger.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.170
I've researched this.
How to do it.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.005
I watched a lot of
videos on Youtube

10:32.048 --> 10:33.673
about bagging
competitions.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.216
I'm trying to get
prepared for this.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.301
Who's coming?

10:36.344 --> 10:37.510
>> I got two kids
from Brookshire's.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.304
Free Duck Commander
shirts, they're in.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.805
>> That was easy.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.599
>> Well, I mean,
I watched a few.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.726
Then I clicked on
a video of a guy putting

10:44.769 --> 10:46.394
a glow stick in
a microwave.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.562
>> I mean, what's he
gonna win?

10:47.605 --> 10:48.938
>> He might win
his job back.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.691
I actually have Leo
coming, the manager.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.859
>> Really?
>> Yeah.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.945
And that kind of led
to some other videos-

10:55.988 --> 10:58.031
Anyway, I got the
gist of it.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.199
There he is!

10:59.241 --> 11:00.033
What are you idiots
doing out here?

11:00.076 --> 11:00.867
You're back!

11:00.910 --> 11:01.660
>> You're back, baby.

11:01.702 --> 11:02.869
>> What is this crap here?

11:02.912 --> 11:04.954
>> He's organized
a competition.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.706
>> So.
What do you I care?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.875
>> Because your manager,
your old boss,

11:08.918 --> 11:10.210
is going to be here.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.378
>> Leon's going to
be here?

11:11.420 --> 11:12.712
>> I think his name
is Leo?

11:12.755 --> 11:14.172
>> Yeah, it was on
his name tag.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.256
It said, "Leo."

11:15.299 --> 11:16.049
>> I didn't see an N.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.884
>> Was the N silent?

11:18.344 --> 11:19.219
>> Whatever.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.553
>> This is redemption time.

11:20.596 --> 11:21.971
>> And who am I
gonna bag against?

11:22.014 --> 11:23.598
>> I got some boys
from Brookshire's coming.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.392
>> Do not be kidding
about this.

11:25.434 --> 11:28.561
Or I will pop a cap
on ya'lls butt.

11:28.604 --> 11:29.521
>> I'm not kidding.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.106
Don't pop anything
on me.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.065
>> Then I'm in.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.191
>> Well, let's get to
work then.

11:33.234 --> 11:33.942
>> He's back in!

11:33.984 --> 11:34.901
>> He's in.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.152
>> Let's get to work.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.696
>> Look, I knew these
guys would come around,

11:37.738 --> 11:40.448
and finally appreciate
my skills as a bagger.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.742
>> Si, these are your
secret weapon right here.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.619
>> And what are
these secret weapon for?

11:44.662 --> 11:46.079
>> Old people
with arthritis.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.372
>> What if I don't
have arthritis.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.081
>> Oh you got it.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.749
Go!

11:52.420 --> 11:53.795
>> I wish they
would've come around

11:53.838 --> 11:55.380
before they got
me fired.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.005
>> What is it?

11:56.048 --> 11:57.132
>> Peanut butter.

11:57.174 --> 11:57.924
>> What is it?

11:57.967 --> 11:58.883
>> Can.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.093
>> Can of what?

12:00.136 --> 12:02.220
>> But hey,
better late than never.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.265
>> Woo!

12:05.307 --> 12:06.599
>> I read somewhere,

12:06.642 --> 12:09.185
that you need ten
thousand hours of practice

12:09.228 --> 12:11.938
to become an expert
at anything.

12:11.981 --> 12:12.939
>> What is it?

12:12.982 --> 12:15.316
>> Oh, that's Willie's
cream cheese.

12:15.359 --> 12:16.776
And this bagging deal,

12:16.819 --> 12:18.820
I got about four
under my belt.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.947
Hopefully, that'll be enough.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.871
>> This is a piece
of junk.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.956
I got this competition
in the bag.

12:29.999 --> 12:30.999
>> Are you ready
for real now?

12:31.041 --> 12:32.751
>> Oh, that wasn't
for real?

12:32.793 --> 12:33.543
>> Not for real.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.419
>> Well, wait.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.879
I gotta get a bag boys.

12:35.921 --> 12:36.713
>> On my whistle.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.464
Are you ready?

12:37.506 --> 12:38.298
>> Yup.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.135
That's what I'm
talking about boys.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.470
We got a champ.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.312
Willie, you've
been so nervous all morning.

12:52.354 --> 12:53.313
>> I'm fine.

12:53.355 --> 12:54.647
>> You're so ridiculous.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.608
>> I'm at peace with whatever
happens to me today.

12:56.650 --> 12:57.567
>> Oh my gosh.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.985
>> This is it.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.653
If this is the way I gotta go,
this the way I go.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.071
>> They're just
fixing your tooth.

13:02.114 --> 13:05.617
>> I'm seeing stuff online,
and it can get very bad,

13:05.659 --> 13:06.618
really quickly.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.744
>> Come on, dad.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.537
I just got my braces off.
You got this.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.164
>> Braces are nothing.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.791
You didn't break half
your tooth off.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.000
Well, hey
there Willie.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.335
>> Hey!
Hey, doc.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.420
>> How are you today?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.088
>> I'm here.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.007
None of my excuses
worked on Korie.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.842
So here we are at
the dentist to get my

13:22.885 --> 13:24.344
broken tooth fixed.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.429
Are we going to do
the gas and stuff?

13:26.472 --> 13:27.972
>> Well, I'm just gonna
look at your tooth first.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.057
>> Okay.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.183
>> Let's see what's
going on, okay?

13:30.226 --> 13:31.309
I'm gonna lean you
back, all right.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.852
>> But you're not-
You're just looking.

13:32.895 --> 13:33.853
>> I'm gonna look-

13:33.896 --> 13:34.687
He's just
looking, babe.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.022
They're just looking.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.023
>> Bella's held up
her end of the deal by

13:37.066 --> 13:38.399
getting her braces removed.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.568
And now it's my turn to
get in the torture chair.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.737
I mean...
dentist chair.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.113
All right,
can you open for me?

13:44.406 --> 13:45.365
Can you open for me?

13:45.407 --> 13:46.407
Mmm hmm.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.742
>> All right, just give
it a try.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.868
>> Is that just
the mirror?

13:48.911 --> 13:50.370
>> Just the mirror, yeah,
you're good.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.205
>> Look , I know I need
to get this tooth fixed,

13:52.248 --> 13:54.541
but lets just say
I've got some trust issues

13:54.583 --> 13:55.959
when it comes
to dentists.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.378
And their creepy
medieval looking tools.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.214
>> There it is, right there.

14:01.257 --> 14:04.050
That's just the q-tip.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.134
>> I mean, seriously,

14:05.177 --> 14:06.219
why haven't dentist
tools changed in

14:06.262 --> 14:07.762
the last one hundred years.

14:07.805 --> 14:08.930
You'd think they'd
have freakin' lasers

14:08.973 --> 14:10.557
do this stuff by now.

14:10.599 --> 14:11.391
All we're going
to have to do

14:11.433 --> 14:12.600
today is that crown.

14:12.643 --> 14:13.518
Let's do it.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.769
Let's just knock
it out today.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.396
No, we're not-
Not now, like right now.

14:16.438 --> 14:17.480
Right this minute.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.648
>> Yeah, we just need
to do it, babe.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.524
Don't we
need some time to-

14:19.567 --> 14:20.775
>> Nope.

14:20.818 --> 14:21.860
No time like
the present.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.236
>> But I'm totally
normal right now.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.195
Okay, how
about what we'll do-

14:24.238 --> 14:25.738
>> I feel pain right now.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.073
Can we try
some happy gas,

14:27.116 --> 14:28.074
some laughing gas on?

14:28.117 --> 14:29.117
>> Yeah.

14:29.159 --> 14:29.909
Give him-
Give him whatever.

14:29.952 --> 14:30.869
How's that?

14:30.911 --> 14:31.828
>> Turn it on
wide open.

14:31.871 --> 14:32.996
>> Okay.

14:33.038 --> 14:33.955
All right, we're gonna
put this little thing

14:33.998 --> 14:35.498
on your nose here,
okay.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.459
I'm not gonna wake
up and have

14:38.502 --> 14:40.962
a crazy grill,
or anything,l am I?

15:02.192 --> 15:03.234
Hey Willie.

15:03.277 --> 15:06.029
Let's take this
laughing gas off here.

15:06.530 --> 15:07.655
All right.
You did great.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.615
That was fantastic.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.700
>> How you feel?

15:10.743 --> 15:12.660
Did you get the duck
put on this tooth?

15:12.703 --> 15:14.120
>> You put a duck
on my tooth?

15:14.163 --> 15:17.624
>> Yeah. You got a
duck logo on your tooth.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.000
>> You did that?

15:19.043 --> 15:20.501
>> No, you did that.

15:20.544 --> 15:22.503
You wanted a whole
zoo in your mouth.

15:22.546 --> 15:23.838
You wanted like a
squirrel in your

15:23.881 --> 15:25.715
front teeth
and everything.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.176
>> Do I have a squirrel
in my front tooth?

15:28.218 --> 15:29.594
>> I didn't put a squirrel
on your front tooth,

15:29.637 --> 15:32.180
but we did get a
duck on your back tooth.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.431
>> We compromised.

15:34.725 --> 15:35.975
>> Lets show Korie what
it looks like, okay.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.143
>> Let me see.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.686
There you go.
Right there.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.022
>> Oh, wow!

15:41.065 --> 15:42.357
You're probably the
only person in the world

15:42.399 --> 15:44.400
that has that, babe.

15:44.818 --> 15:46.444
It's probably not a
good idea to make big

15:46.487 --> 15:48.529
decisions while
you're on laughing gas.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.531
>> Maybe there's some
brilliance there.

15:50.574 --> 15:51.908
I got an idea.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.703
I got tattoos on my arm,
I'll get one on my teeth.

15:55.746 --> 15:56.704
I can do
exactly that.

15:56.747 --> 15:57.830
We make the
crown here.

15:57.873 --> 15:59.290
And I can glue it
on in maybe in about

15:59.333 --> 16:00.416
thirty- forty five minutes.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.709
>> Apparently once
I found out that he

16:01.752 --> 16:03.419
could put logos
on teeth,

16:03.462 --> 16:06.047
that changed everything.
A squirrel.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.048
A squirrel?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.675
>> A squirrel.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.635
>> Okay.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.678
>> Willie would get
a tattoo on his forehead

16:11.720 --> 16:13.554
if it was socially
acceptable.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.722
>> Nah, I wouldn't.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.350
I guess I could get
a tattoo on the lower

16:17.393 --> 16:19.686
part of my face,
because I have a beard.

16:19.728 --> 16:20.895
You wouldn't be
able to see it.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.438
>> Well, that wouldn't-
What's the point?

16:22.481 --> 16:24.399
>> Mike Tyson has
a face tattoo.

16:24.441 --> 16:27.235
>> That's weird.
All right.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.319
Well, we'll go get
the car.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.821
We'll pull the car
around, okay.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.198
All right, you look
good, babe.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.491
You did great.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.534
Can I get
the One direction

16:34.576 --> 16:35.410
logo on my teeth?

16:35.452 --> 16:37.036
What?!
No.

16:44.461 --> 16:48.423
Welcome to the
First Annual Bagmaster Classic.

16:48.465 --> 16:50.591
All right, there's
three criteria.

16:50.634 --> 16:54.095
There's Speed, efficiency,
and technique.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.639
Whoever can master
these three things,

16:56.682 --> 16:58.141
shall be the champion.

16:58.183 --> 17:02.270
First up, John,
aka Superman.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.271
You better watch out,

17:03.313 --> 17:05.148
because he's Superman
for a reason.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.774
For Si to come out
to be victorious,

17:06.817 --> 17:09.277
he's gonna need
three things.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.695
Ready?
Set.

17:13.657 --> 17:14.699
>> Come on,
you got to!

17:14.742 --> 17:15.658
Got to go!
Got to go!

17:15.701 --> 17:17.118
>> He needs laser focus.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.745
I like it.
I like it.

17:18.787 --> 17:19.370
Doing pretty good.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.413
Doing pretty good.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.498
>> He needs
pure determination.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.959
Fifty one seconds.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.711
Fifty one seconds.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.629
And for the other baggers
to spontaneously

17:28.672 --> 17:32.008
combust before the
results are in.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.261
Next up,
Demarcus D Swoll.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.137
Ready!

17:37.306 --> 17:38.765
Wow, look at him.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.475
This is like chess,
with groceries.

17:40.517 --> 17:43.352
When you look at
the contestants,

17:43.395 --> 17:45.188
you have these young
whipper-snappers.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.147
>> Oh nice.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.690
>> The reach over!

17:47.733 --> 17:49.358
>> These guys are younger.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.486
>> He's got three bags,
he's doing pretty good.

17:51.528 --> 17:52.570
>> They're stronger.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.488
>> There you go.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.655
>> Get it in there.
Come on.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.032
>> They have more quickness.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.411
>> Thirty nine seconds.
Very nice time.

18:00.788 --> 18:03.873
>> You look at Si,
you think...

18:03.916 --> 18:05.875
>> Do what?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.210
>> Exactly.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.922
>> Next up,
last but not least, Silas.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.298
>> All right,
come on, Si!

18:12.341 --> 18:13.633
>> Come on, Si.

18:13.675 --> 18:14.801
Demarcus...

18:14.843 --> 18:16.010
you're going down like
the rodeo clown, son.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.512
>> That means you're
in trouble.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.765
Ready...

18:22.768 --> 18:24.060
Did anybody ever
tell you about how

18:24.103 --> 18:25.228
pretty your eyes are?

18:25.270 --> 18:26.604
Who's he talkin' too?

18:26.647 --> 18:27.855
He's talking
to a customer.

18:27.898 --> 18:28.856
Emerald green.

18:28.899 --> 18:29.899
That's a good move.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.067
Keep talkin', Si!

18:31.110 --> 18:33.194
My cat has got
yellow eyes.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.862
Look.
The last time I checked,

18:34.905 --> 18:38.491
customer interaction
is a key point of bagging.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.159
Ma'am, have you got
the coupon for this?

18:40.202 --> 18:42.578
This is a two for one sale,
if you've got-

18:42.621 --> 18:44.080
You do?
Good work.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.874
>> Talk while bag!
Speed!

18:46.917 --> 18:48.042
Smart shoppin'.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.044
Look, this what
separates us from being

18:50.087 --> 18:52.213
some kind
of bagging robot.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.423
Come on.
Come on.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.716
>> Look, if that was all
there was to it,

18:55.759 --> 18:57.885
we would just turn
the conveyer built

18:57.928 --> 18:59.720
wide open, okay,

18:59.763 --> 19:02.557
and let it sling all the
groceries into a net.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.058
Hey, then you'd just
put it in your pack,

19:04.101 --> 19:06.894
throw it the cart.
Roll 'em outside.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.563
>> Put it in there.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.231
>> Boo-yah!

19:10.274 --> 19:11.232
>> What is it?

19:11.275 --> 19:13.234
>> One minute,
fifty three seconds.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.236
One minute and
fifty three seconds?!

19:15.279 --> 19:16.320
Gah!

19:16.363 --> 19:17.321
Maybe I should've
practice more than

19:17.364 --> 19:19.240
an hour after all.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.742
The numbers
have been tallied.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.077
And we have a winner.

19:23.120 --> 19:27.165
With a score of 9 of 10
in efficiency,

19:27.207 --> 19:29.458
the winner goes to
Mr. Demarcus--

19:29.501 --> 19:31.043
>> Woo-hoo!

19:31.086 --> 19:34.088
In your face!

19:34.131 --> 19:35.631
However...

19:35.674 --> 19:36.591
However.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.634
>> I would like to
commend Si,

19:38.677 --> 19:40.469
really have improved
as a bagger.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.762
>> Why I appreciate that.

19:41.805 --> 19:44.390
>> I would like to extend
you a job offer today.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.601
>> Look, I may have
lost the competition,

19:46.643 --> 19:48.728
but at least Deon
knows now,

19:48.770 --> 19:51.147
hey, I have what it
takes to dawn

19:51.190 --> 19:53.274
the red polo shirt again.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.692
>> Under one condition.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.943
>> What condition?

19:55.986 --> 19:57.820
>> You must shave
the beard.

19:57.863 --> 19:58.905
>> No.

19:58.947 --> 20:01.282
Shave my beard...
for a bagging job?

20:01.325 --> 20:02.450
Are you kidding me?

20:02.492 --> 20:04.243
I appreciate the offer
there, Leon or Leo.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.203
Leo.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.120
>> The extension's
always there.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.121
It's Leo by the way.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.122
>> Leo.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.208
Who does Leon think
he is anyway?

20:11.001 --> 20:12.960
This thing is priceless.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.378
All right, let's get
back to work.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.463
Guys.

20:15.505 --> 20:16.464
Hey, ya'll gotta check
this tooth out.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.174
No.
No thanks.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.508
We gotta get
back to work.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.469
Thanks for
coming ya'll.

20:21.511 --> 20:22.386
>> What's the deal?

20:22.429 --> 20:23.512
Nobody wants to
see a tooth?

20:23.555 --> 20:24.680
Hey!

20:24.723 --> 20:25.932
Who had the groceries
out in the warehouse?

20:25.974 --> 20:27.141
- Jep.
- Jep.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.351
- Si.
- That's Jep's.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.019
Come clean
this crap up.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.647
Father, we thank
you for adopting

20:32.689 --> 20:34.440
us as your children.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.983
We're not taking it
for granted;

20:36.026 --> 20:38.152
this food that we are
thanking you for.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.820
We do appreciate it.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.822
In the name of
Jesus I pray.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.199
- Amen.
- Amen.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.159
>> Lets get on these
chicken pot pies!

20:46.453 --> 20:47.536
You're never
too old to try something

20:47.579 --> 20:49.121
outside your comfort zone.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.832
Whether that's exploring
a new profession,

20:51.875 --> 20:53.834
or facing a fear.

20:53.877 --> 20:55.044
And even if your
family thinks your

20:55.087 --> 20:57.838
dreams or fears are
a bit irrational,

20:57.881 --> 20:59.799
it helps to know that
no matter what,

20:59.841 --> 21:01.509
you have their support.

21:01.551 --> 21:04.178
Whether it's setting up
a bagging competition,

21:04.221 --> 21:06.222
or holding you hand
at the dentist.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.474
That support won't
ever fade.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.893
In fact, it's as permanent
as a duck tattoo

21:10.936 --> 21:12.353
on your back molar.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.063
Hey Willie,
pass the cream cheese.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.932
Si, there's no
cream cheese!
