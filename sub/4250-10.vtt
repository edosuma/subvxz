[adventurous music]

00:37.328 --> 00:40.457
- COME ON, JEROME,
I'D LIKE TO CLEAR UP.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.585
- YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MUCH
SOME PEOPLE CAN EAT, TRUDY.

00:45.420 --> 00:49.132
- HAVE YOU TWO
HAD A FALLING OUT?

00:49.215 --> 00:50.133
- THEY'VE SPLIT UP.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.593
- NO, WE HAVEN'T.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.636
- WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO, JEROME?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.472
- WHY DOES EVERYONE
AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME

00:55.555 --> 00:57.682
IT WAS ME
THAT DID SOMETHING WRONG?

01:00.185 --> 01:03.104
I NEED TO START HANGING OUT
WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW ME.

01:11.362 --> 01:12.530
- I DON'T GET IT.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.406
I'D NEVER BELIEVE AMBER
WOULD BETRAY US.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.366
NEVER.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.367
- WE HEARD HER.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.120
WE SAW HER GIVE
VICTOR THE BRACELET.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.753
- GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.005
YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE.

01:29.088 --> 01:32.634
MISS MILLINGTON
HAS LEFT THE SCHOOL.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.010
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SHE'S LEFT?

01:34.093 --> 01:37.180
- SHE IS CURRENTLY TRAVELING
BACK TO AMERICA WITH HER FATHER,

01:37.263 --> 01:40.767
WHERE SHE WILL ATTEND
SOME FASHION SCHOOL.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.520
- YOU'RE LYING.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.355
- NOT NOW.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.482
SHE COULDN'T.

01:47.565 --> 01:48.983
SHE WOULDN'T.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.319
SHE DIDN'T EVEN SAY GOODBYE.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.161
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.788
FIRST, SHE GIVES VICTOR
THE BRACELET,

02:01.871 --> 02:03.331
AND NOW SHE'S GONE?

02:03.414 --> 02:04.958
- ALFIE, ALFIE.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.418
- DID YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

02:07.502 --> 02:08.502
- WHAT?

02:08.586 --> 02:11.005
NO, WHY?

02:11.089 --> 02:12.715
- WELL, YOU SEEM VERY INTERESTED
IN WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HER.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.760
- I WAS JUST WORRIED.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.303
- YEAH, BUT YOU BARELY
EVEN KNOW HER.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.058
- I CARE ABOUT HER.

02:22.141 --> 02:24.435
IS THERE SOMETHING
SO WRONG WITH THAT?

02:40.368 --> 02:41.703
- HEY.

02:41.786 --> 02:44.831
LOOK, PATRICIA IS JUST,
PATRICIA.

02:44.914 --> 02:48.626
SHE'LL GET OVER HERSELF.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.712
- IT'S NOT JUST HER THOUGH.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.922
- LOOK, ONE THING TO
KNOW ABOUT US BRITS,

02:53.006 --> 02:55.550
IS WE HATE TO SHOW WE CARE.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.177
BUT SOME OF US LIKE
HAVING YOU AROUND,

02:58.261 --> 02:58.595
AND WE'LL LOOK OUT FOR YOU.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.930
OKAY?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.432
- THANKS, JOY.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.142

[deep warbling tone]

03:24.871 --> 03:27.624

NO!

03:39.636 --> 03:41.262
[warbling fades]

03:42.680 --> 03:44.641

03:46.476 --> 03:47.268

- YEAH.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.438
- OKAY.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.523
- AND, WELL,

03:52.607 --> 03:55.443
AND WE DON'T HAVE AN
AMERICAN YET, SO...

03:55.526 --> 03:56.527

03:57.111 --> 03:58.738

- REALLY.

04:03.242 --> 04:04.661
- AND?

04:04.744 --> 04:07.163
- I'M SORRY ABOUT EARLIER.

04:07.246 --> 04:08.873
I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN IT.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.294
- SEE, ROOM FOR ONE MORE.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.339
- YOU GUYS,
THAT IS SO SWEET.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.548
- OH, KT.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.468
- OH, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
CRY ON ME, ARE YOU?

04:20.551 --> 04:22.220
I REALLY DON'T DO TEARS.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.638
- SHE REALLY DOESN'T.

04:23.721 --> 04:24.931
- I'D LOVE TO JOIN.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.849

[phone beeps]

04:37.986 --> 04:40.655
- MEET ME IN SCHOOL NOW.

04:45.868 --> 04:46.577
- IS THAT AMBER?

04:46.661 --> 04:48.413
WHAT'S SHE GOT TO SAY?

04:48.496 --> 04:49.914
- IT'S AN UNKNOWN NUMBER.

04:49.998 --> 04:50.790
- I BROUGHT YOU SOME CAKE,
DO YOU WANT IT, HEY!

04:50.873 --> 04:53.459
HEY, HEY, ALFIE!

04:53.543 --> 04:54.669
I GOT CAKE AND EVERYTHING!

04:58.464 --> 04:59.882
- WHAT A WEIRD TEXT.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.551
- WHOA, CRAZY TEXT I GOT.

05:01.634 --> 05:02.552
- MEET ME AT SCHOOL NOW?

05:02.635 --> 05:03.386
- YOU GOT IT TOO?

05:03.469 --> 05:04.804
- WHAT IF IT'S VICTOR?

05:04.887 --> 05:07.473
- WELL, WHOEVER IT IS WANTS TO
TALK, THEN LET'S TALK.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.059
- AND IF IT'S NOT TALKING
THEY WANT TO DO?

05:10.143 --> 05:10.727
- SAFETY IN NUMBERS.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.729
RIGHT?

05:15.148 --> 05:19.193
[deep warbling tone]

05:29.996 --> 05:31.205
[knocking on door]

05:31.289 --> 05:32.749
- WHO IS IT?

05:32.832 --> 05:34.167
- MARA, IT'S ME.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.668
CAN WE TALK?

05:35.752 --> 05:37.837
- JEROME, I TOLD YOU
I NEED SOME SPACE.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.047
- AND I KNOW.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.214
I RESPECT THAT.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.257
I DO.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.259
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE MAD AT ME.

05:43.342 --> 05:50.725
I'M ARROGANT, I'M SELFISH,
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I HURT YOU.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.605
I CAN'T--

05:55.688 --> 05:58.608
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HURT
MY LITTLE BEANSY BOB.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.572
- BEANSY BOB?

06:06.282 --> 06:07.283
NO.

06:11.412 --> 06:15.041
- WHENEVER YOU
FEEL LIKE TALKING.

06:23.758 --> 06:24.967
- I FEEL BAD.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.302
- WHY?

06:26.385 --> 06:28.137
JEROME IS LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.640
AND WE'RE THE SISTERHOOD, RIGHT?

06:30.723 --> 06:31.849
WHAT WOULD KT AND PATRICIA SAY?

06:43.402 --> 06:44.821
- OKAY, OUT OF
ALL OUR BAD IDEAS,

06:44.904 --> 06:47.323
THIS IS DEFINITELY UP THERE
WITH THE WORST.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.033
- IT'S OKAY, STAY BEHIND ME.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.411
- AND THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL SAFE HOW?

07:00.336 --> 07:02.380
[thumping sound]

07:04.715 --> 07:05.925
- WHAT, YOU GUYS?

07:06.008 --> 07:06.717
- EDDIE?

07:06.801 --> 07:07.468
- LOOK WHO'S WITH HIM.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.345
THERE'S A SURPRISE.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.139
- HEY, I THOUGHT WE
WERE OVER ALL THAT.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.515
- YOU GOT A TEXT AS WELL?

07:12.598 --> 07:14.267
- WE THOUGHT WE'D
BE MEETING DENBY.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.060
- AND WHAT WOULD
MAKE YOU THINK THAT?

07:16.144 --> 07:18.187
- NO, WE JUST THOUGHT THAT...

07:18.271 --> 07:19.397
- YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW SOMETHING.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.773
- YEAH, AND I WONDER
HOW THAT IS.

07:20.857 --> 07:21.816
- WHAT?
- YOU HEARD.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.693
- YEAH, I HEARD YOU
ACCUSING HER.

07:23.776 --> 07:24.652
- WELL, MAYBE WE ARE.

07:24.735 --> 07:25.695
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

07:25.778 --> 07:26.362
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU.

07:26.445 --> 07:28.447
- RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?

07:28.531 --> 07:30.283
- LOOK, SHOULDN'T WE FIGURE
OUT WHO SENT US HERE?

07:30.366 --> 07:31.576
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE ANYWAY?

07:31.659 --> 07:33.369
- WHAT, LIKE WE'RE
GONNA TELL YOU ANYTHING.

07:33.452 --> 07:37.123
- AH!

07:38.916 --> 07:42.128
WOW, SHOUTING'S
REALLY HARD WORK.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.091
ANYWAY, NOW YOU'RE LISTENING.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.634
SURPRISE!

07:48.718 --> 07:49.302
- AMBER, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

07:49.385 --> 07:50.219
- BUSY BETRAYING US?

07:50.303 --> 07:53.222
- OKAY, SPOILER ALERT.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.433
BUT AFTER YOU GUYS ABANDONED
ME IN THE GATEHOUSE--

07:55.516 --> 07:56.559
- THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

07:56.642 --> 07:57.977
- DETAILS.

07:58.060 --> 08:00.855
MEANWHILE, I SPENT THE NIGHT
IN DENBY'S SECRET ROOM

08:00.938 --> 08:03.524
WITH THIS VERY STRANGE
TANK THING.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.651
- THE ONE WITH THE GUY HOOKED
UP TO THE VALVES AND STUFF.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.194
- THE WHAT NOW?

08:06.277 --> 08:07.904
- WE WERE THERE.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.280
IT'S SERIOUSLY TERRIFYING.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.949
THERE'S A MAN IN A TANK
AND I THINK HE'S ASLEEP.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.951
- ACTUALLY, HE'S BEEN
CURSED BY ANUBIS.

08:14.035 --> 08:19.498
- MISS DENBY HAS A CURSED GUY
IN A TANK IN HER HOUSE?

08:19.582 --> 08:21.918
OKAY, JUST CHECKING.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.921
- ANYHOW, VICTOR, DENBY,
AND SWEETIE HAVE A PLAN.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.548
THEY'RE GOING TO BREAK THE CURSE
AND WAKE HIM UP.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.301
AND THEY'RE GOING TO
PERFORM A CEREMONY.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.260
- WHAT HAPPENS THEN?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.931
- SOME GREAT EVIL
IS UNLEASHED INTO THE WORLD.

08:35.014 --> 08:35.932
- NO, NO.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.892
ONE WORD: DENBY.

08:49.403 --> 08:52.448
- SOMEONE'S BEEN ON MY LAPTOP.

09:04.669 --> 09:05.795
[gasps]

09:08.005 --> 09:11.467
- RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T KNOW
WHO DENBY REALLY IS.

09:11.550 --> 09:12.885
OUR GUESS IS
VICTOR DOESN'T EITHER.

09:12.969 --> 09:13.970
- WE NEED TO STOP HER.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.137
- WHAT ABOUT THE PACKAGE?

09:15.221 --> 09:16.555
WHY DO THEY WANT IT SO BAD?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.599
- IT CONTAINS THE INSTRUCTIONS
FOR THE CEREMONY.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.686
- THE WORDS NEEDED
TO BREAK THE CURSE.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.312
- AND YOU GAVE THEM TO VICTOR.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.564
- WAIT, YOU'VE DONE WHAT?

09:25.648 --> 09:27.358
- AMBER, HOW COULD YOU
SELL US OUT?

09:27.441 --> 09:28.401
- YOU BETRAYED US.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.528
- AND YOU CAN'T EVEN ADMIT IT.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.613
- OH, ALFIE.

09:32.697 --> 09:32.738
SILLY.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.995
THE PACKAGE I GAVE TO VICTOR
WAS A FAKE.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.499
WHEN VICTOR AND DENBY
CAUGHT ME,

09:43.582 --> 09:44.959
THEY KNEW I MUST
HAVE THE PACKAGE,

09:45.042 --> 09:47.503
AND THEY WERE GOING TO DO
ANYTHING TO GET IT BACK.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.547
BUT I HAD AN IDEA.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.425
I REMEMBERED THE FORTUNES KT
WAS GOING TO PUT IN HER COOKIES,

09:52.508 --> 09:56.345
SO I PUT THEM
IN THE ENVELOPE.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.014
- BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BRACELET?

09:58.097 --> 09:59.890
- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T GIVE THEM THAT.

09:59.974 --> 10:04.020
- WELL, I HAD TO PUT
A BRACELET IN THERE.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.396
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED THAT
I BORROWED ONE OF PATRICIA'S.

10:05.479 --> 10:08.691
AND YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT.

10:08.774 --> 10:09.692
IT HAD THIS REALLY COOL
MOON SYMBOL ON IT

10:09.775 --> 10:11.902
THAT I USED
TO SEAL THE ENVELOPE.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.821
SO, I POPPED IT
BACK IN THE PACKAGE,

10:13.904 --> 10:14.780
WRAPPED IT ALL UP,

10:14.864 --> 10:18.534
AND GAVE IT BACK TO VICTOR.

10:18.617 --> 10:20.036
- WOW.

10:26.792 --> 10:31.964
- ALMOST 100 YEARS OF WAITING,
CORBIERRE.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.468
100 YEARS.

10:49.273 --> 10:53.903
IT'S PERFECT.

10:53.986 --> 10:57.865
EXACTLY HOW I DREAMED
IT WOULD BE.

10:59.116 --> 11:03.037
- BUT LISTEN,
VICTOR WON'T BE FOOLED FOREVER.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.413
HE'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT I'VE DONE
AT SOME POINT

11:04.497 --> 11:08.918
AND HE WON'T BE ABLE TO REACH ME
BUT HE MIGHT GET TO YOU.

11:16.675 --> 11:19.553
- YOU'VE GOT TO START
WORKING TOGETHER.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.431
IT'S TIME TO REFORM SIBUNA.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.766
- [indistinct whispering]

11:23.849 --> 11:25.101
- I'LL TELL YOU LATER.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.186
- IT'S A GOOD THING KT.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.063
- ARE YOU UP FOR IT?

11:30.231 --> 11:31.273
- YEAH.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.526
- AND YOU NEED A NEW LEADER.

11:33.609 --> 11:37.446
AS THE LONGEST STANDING MEMBER,
I VOTE FABIAN.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.864
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.449
NO, I CAN'T BE LEADER.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.369
I'M NOT THE OSIRIAN.

11:48.457 --> 11:51.293
- WHAT, YOU WANT ME
TO LEAD SIBUNA?

11:52.503 --> 11:53.629
- I'M A BETTER WINGMAN.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.589
- AND WHO BETTER
TO EXPLAIN TO YOUR DAD

11:55.673 --> 11:58.092
THAT WHAT HE'S DOING IS WRONG?

12:05.057 --> 12:05.891
- YEAH, BRING IT ON.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.816
- MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.485
NOW, IT'S TIME TO SPRINKLE
SOME OF THAT MAGIC

12:16.569 --> 12:17.611
IN FASHION SCHOOL.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.244
- YOU HAVE TO GO NOW?

12:25.327 --> 12:27.121
- IT'S ALL BEEN ARRANGED.

12:27.204 --> 12:30.374
SWEETIE, DENBY, AND VICTOR
WANT ME OUT OF HERE.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.667
- DID THEY THREATEN YOU?

12:31.750 --> 12:32.710
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

12:32.793 --> 12:34.295
- DON'T WORRY.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.504
BUT DADDY'S WAITING
IN THE CAR.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.881
I JUST SNUCK OUT
TO SAY GOODBYE.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.515
WELL, HELLO, A HUG MAYBE?

12:59.195 --> 13:00.529
- YOU WILL WRITE, YEAH?

13:00.613 --> 13:04.450
AND SHOW ME THE PHOTOS OF
YOU AND YOUR COOL NEW FRIENDS.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.036
- THEY'LL NEVER BE
AS COOL AS YOU GUYS.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.288
SLIGHTLY BETTER DRESSED, MAYBE.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.165
- HEY.

13:11.248 --> 13:15.044
- THERE'S SO MUCH
I WANTED TO SAY.

13:15.127 --> 13:18.297
- THE WAY I SEE IT,
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.467
[indistinct whispering]

13:21.550 --> 13:23.886
BYE, ALFIE.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.563
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE
SO MUCH FUN.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.236
SIBUNA.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.278
- all: SIBUNA.

13:41.362 --> 13:41.987
- SIBUNA.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.876
- THERE.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.087
YOU'RE OFFICIALLY
A MEMBER OF THE SISTERHOOD NOW.

13:58.170 --> 13:58.837
- OOH, THANKS, GUYS!

14:03.509 --> 14:04.343
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

14:04.426 --> 14:07.346
IS IT FABIAN?

14:07.429 --> 14:10.474
- NO, IT'S JUST--

14:10.558 --> 14:12.101
IT'S NOTHING.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.061
LIFE JUST STRESSES ME OUT,
I GUESS.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.188
- I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.691
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A TOUGH
TIME WITH JEROME, RIGHT?

14:18.774 --> 14:21.151
- MAYBE A BIT.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.361
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED?

14:22.444 --> 14:24.113
- A ROAD TRIP TO MEXICO

14:24.196 --> 14:27.783
WITH THE WIND IN OUR HAIR
AND THE LAW ON OUR TAILS.

14:27.866 --> 14:28.784
- NO.

14:28.867 --> 14:30.077
- OH.

14:30.160 --> 14:34.498
- SINCE AMBER LEFT US
ALL OF HER STUFF.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.543
I FIGURED,
IT'S MAKEOVER O'CLOCK!

14:37.626 --> 14:38.627
- AW.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.546
- COME ON,
WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO LOSE?

14:40.629 --> 14:41.797
IT MIGHT BE FUN.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.758
- OR EXCRUCIATING.

14:46.802 --> 14:47.720
- I'M IN.

14:47.803 --> 14:48.470
- YEAH, LET'S DO THIS.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.598
- COME ON, PATTY.

14:50.681 --> 14:51.599
- NO.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.142
- COME ON, COME ON.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.354
[overlapping chatter]

15:03.402 --> 15:07.156
- LIFE WITHOUT LITERATURE
IS DEATH.

15:07.239 --> 15:12.369
- THOSE WHO WISH TO SING,
WILL FIND A SONG.

15:12.453 --> 15:17.124
- THE GREATEST TREASURE
IS WORN WITH PRIDE.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.251
- THEY'RE JUST OLD PROVERBS.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.503
WHERE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS
FOR THE RITUAL?

15:21.587 --> 15:25.507
- I DON'T KNOW, ERIC,

15:25.591 --> 15:29.470
BUT WITHOUT THEM,

15:29.553 --> 15:32.181
THIS IS USELESS.

15:32.264 --> 15:35.184
ALL THESE YEARS OF WAITING.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.564
- TRY THIS ON.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.274
- HEY, GUYS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:44.109 --> 15:45.527
- WOW.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.570
- IT'S PRETTY, RIGHT?

15:46.654 --> 15:48.697
- YOU LOOK AMAZING.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.282
- I THINK WE ALL DO.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.743
ESPECIALLY YOU, PATRICIA.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.662
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?

15:54.745 --> 15:59.041
- I FEEL LIKE
THE SISTERHOOD ROCKS.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.543
- both:
OH!

16:03.170 --> 16:08.217
- UNLESS THESE
AREN'T JUST PROVERBS.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.718
- HMM?

16:11.512 --> 16:13.722
- MAYBE IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS

16:13.806 --> 16:15.766
TO PUT THE BRACELET
AND THE INSTRUCTIONS

16:15.849 --> 16:17.976
IN THE SAME PACKAGE.

16:18.060 --> 16:22.481
AND THESE COULD JUST BE CLUES
AS TO WHERE WE MIGHT FIND THEM.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.319
- THEY MUST BE HERE.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.738
HIDDEN IN THIS BUILDING.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.782
- IMAGINE THAT, VICTOR.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.952
RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES,
THE WHOLE TIME.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.130
- HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

16:46.213 --> 16:47.673
- I HAD THE OLD KEY
UP MY SLEEVE.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.137
- SORRY I'M LATE.

16:55.764 --> 17:00.686
- SO, IT'S THE LEFT HAND, YEAH?

17:00.769 --> 17:03.105
I'M JOKING.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.189
SIBUNA.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.816
- all: SIBUNA.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.278
- YEAH, SIBUNA'S BACK IN TOWN.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.779
SIBUNA'S BACK IN TOWN.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.321
SORRY, SORRY.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.241
YOU CAN TALK.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.452
- ALL RIGHT.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.287
MAN IN THE TANK.

17:18.369 --> 17:19.621
WHAT DO WE GOT?

17:19.704 --> 17:20.539
- WELL, WE KNOW THERE'S
A CEREMONY TO WAKE HIM UP.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.624
USING THE BRACELET.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.626
- AND WE HAVE
THE INSTRUCTIONS.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.421
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN.

17:27.503 --> 17:30.174
- OKAY, CHILDREN OF CHILDREN
SLEEP THE DAY BY.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.468
DO WE THINK
THE CHILD IS VICTOR?

17:32.551 --> 17:34.011
- OH, WHAT,
VICTOR AND VICTOR, SR.?

17:34.094 --> 17:37.097
- OR MISS DENBY
AND HER FOLKS.

17:37.181 --> 17:40.017
- OR IS IT SOMETHING
MORE OBVIOUS THAN THAT?

17:41.477 --> 17:42.686
ME AND DAD?

17:44.104 --> 17:45.439
- OH?

17:46.523 --> 17:49.568
- NO, LOOK,
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.153
BUT WE NEED TO
FIND MORE CLUES

17:51.236 --> 17:53.155
IF WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO STOP THE CEREMONY.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.283
- SO, I SAY, WE GO BACK
TO THE GATEHOUSE TONIGHT.

17:56.366 --> 17:56.658
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.869
- WHAT?

17:58.952 --> 17:59.745
YOU MEAN, GO BACK AND SEE
THE SCARY MAN IN THE TANK?

17:59.828 --> 18:02.080
- WHEN MISS DENBY'S THERE?

18:02.164 --> 18:03.540
- THAT'S THE OTHER THING.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.834
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHO SHE REALLY IS.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.631
HEY, YOU GUYS MADE ME LEADER.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.724
- WAIT, WAIT.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.810
WHEN WE GET THERE,
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT MISS DENBY?

18:22.893 --> 18:24.520
- WE NEED TO
GET HER OUTSIDE.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.980
KEEP HER TALKING.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.274
- SO WHO DO WE KNOW
THAT'S GOOD AT TALKING?

18:32.444 --> 18:34.822
- YOU'RE ON SUCH THIN ICE.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.333
[doorbell ringing]

18:54.591 --> 18:56.969
- PATRICIA?

18:57.052 --> 18:59.096
- SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, MISS,
WE WERE JUST ON OUR WAY HOME

18:59.179 --> 19:01.640
AND ALFIE GOT ATTACKED
BY A RABBIT.

19:01.723 --> 19:02.641
- I WASN'T ATTACKED.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.059
IT SURPRISED ME.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.060
THAT'S THE WORD.

19:05.144 --> 19:05.978
I THINK I BROKE MY ANKLE.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.563
- I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A LOOK.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.773
- OOH!

19:09.857 --> 19:10.983
- IT DOESN'T FEEL BROKEN.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.317
IT'S PROBABLY JUST SPRAINED.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.902
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE IT
TO THE HOUSE?

19:13.986 --> 19:14.945
- HE CAN'T.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.114
- OH, NO,
IT HURTS REALLY BAD.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.409
- I'LL GO AND FETCH SOME ICE.

19:28.250 --> 19:28.792
- MISS, MISS, PLEASE, I--

19:28.876 --> 19:31.169
- WHAT, ALFIE?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.088
- MY ANKLE.

19:50.856 --> 19:56.278
- DO YOU THINK MISS DENBY
MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME WORK DONE?

19:56.361 --> 19:59.448
MAYBE A FACE TRANSPLANT?

19:59.531 --> 20:01.533
EDDIE.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.452
PECULIAR.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.786
WHAT COULD YOU MEAN?

20:04.870 --> 20:08.040
AND THERE'S A WEB ADDRESS.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.425
HARRIET DENBY.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.387
LOVELY PICTURE.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.109
- THE THING ABOUT
SECRET DOORS,

20:36.193 --> 20:39.321
THEY'RE KIND OF SECRET.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.365
- SO THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.783
- WHAT?

20:43.825 --> 20:45.243
- WHAT?

20:45.327 --> 20:48.413
I MEAN, OH,
YOU'VE GOT A KEY TO THE DOOR.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.665
- NO.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.209
YOU SAID,
"SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S FOR."

20:52.292 --> 20:53.919
BUT I'VE NEVER
SHOWED YOU THIS,

20:54.002 --> 20:55.337
SO WHY DO YOU ACT LIKE
YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN IT?

20:58.090 --> 20:59.091
- WELL, I, I,--

20:59.174 --> 21:00.384
- FABIAN.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.552
- HEY, GUYS, WE'RE KIND
OF ON A SCHEDULE HERE.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.388
KT?

21:04.471 --> 21:05.555
- FINE.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.812
YOU FIRST.

21:11.895 --> 21:14.523
AND THEN I WANT ANSWERS.

21:26.785 --> 21:27.703
- NO WAY.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.663
- FABIAN,
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

21:29.746 --> 21:30.706
- WHAT?

21:30.789 --> 21:34.042
[steam hissing]

21:34.126 --> 21:35.377
- I SAID HOW HAVE
YOU SEEN THIS?

21:35.460 --> 21:36.712
DO YOU GET VISIONS TOO?

21:36.795 --> 21:38.505
- NO, NO, PATRICIA TOOK IT.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.799
- WHAT?

21:40.882 --> 21:43.010
- I'M SORRY, BUT SHE THOUGHT
YOU WERE WORKING FOR VICTOR.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.012
WELL, WE ALL DID.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.054
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

21:46.138 --> 21:47.806
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

21:47.889 --> 21:49.558
- WHAT?
NO.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.393
CAN WE JUST LOOK FOR CLUES
AND GET OUT OF HERE?

21:53.687 --> 21:55.355
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GUYS DIDN'T TRUST ME.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.774
- WELL, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

21:57.858 --> 22:01.194
- THAT IS SO MEAN, FABIAN!

22:01.278 --> 22:01.403
crash!
