WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:04.083
Buddy, I get that you and Carla
have been hanging out a lot,

00:04.166 --> 00:05.709
but pretending
you're going to steal her from me

00:05.792 --> 00:09.083
makes you seem sad,
pathetic and<i> very </i>lonely.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.417
Your woman wants me so bad,

00:11.500 --> 00:14.000
we've developed our own little shorthand
with each other.

00:14.625 --> 00:15.750
-Mornin'.
-Morning.

00:15.834 --> 00:17.834
-That means good morning.
-Noted.

00:18.417 --> 00:20.792
-How was Mardi Gras night?
-Ooh!

00:21.417 --> 00:23.875
Come on!

00:23.959 --> 00:26.500
Enough beads. No more flashing.

00:26.583 --> 00:29.875
-More beads, damn it! Come on!
-Fine.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.375
(whooping)

00:34.458 --> 00:35.875
Aah! Bite me.

00:35.959 --> 00:37.917
(Turk) Sounds pretty embarrassing.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.250
Only because Jasper becomes an innie
when he gets nervous.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.458
(chuckles)
Still...

00:44.083 --> 00:45.709
(both) Friends forever!

00:45.792 --> 00:47.166
(giggling)

00:47.250 --> 00:50.208
(J.D.) <i>Of course, not all relationships</i>
<i>are as solid as Carla's and mine.</i>

00:51.625 --> 00:55.083
Dr. Reid,
why are you using standard macrolides

00:55.166 --> 00:57.125
to treat your patient
instead of Cloveritol?

00:57.208 --> 00:58.458
(hesitant)

00:58.542 --> 01:01.125
<i>Oh, </i>Cloveritol is a drug?

01:01.208 --> 01:03.542
Now, honestly, Bob,
here I was under the impression

01:03.625 --> 01:05.208
that it was a travel agency,

01:05.291 --> 01:08.041
what with all the free golf trips
they've gone ahead and sent you on.

01:08.125 --> 01:11.208
I'll have you know that I do not authorize
any drug for this hospital

01:11.291 --> 01:12.917
that I haven't personally researched.

01:13.667 --> 01:16.250
What did the research
for Cloveritol say, sir?

01:17.333 --> 01:20.125
When life's not fair at all,

01:20.208 --> 01:22.166
use Cloveritol.

01:23.375 --> 01:28.166
Check out Barbie, body-slamming big Bob.
That a girl!

01:28.250 --> 01:31.625
Look, I have spent
the last 3 years in this hospital

01:31.709 --> 01:35.083
getting pushed around because
I'm "little Barbie from Connecticut."

01:35.166 --> 01:38.959
But there is a new toy in town,
and her name is "bitch slap Barbie."

01:40.583 --> 01:42.250
From Connecticut.

01:42.333 --> 01:46.208
Still, let's remember
that you can't even drive the doctor car

01:46.291 --> 01:48.667
without big daddy
sitting right there beside you,

01:48.750 --> 01:52.041
because you went ahead
and accidentally gave the patient

01:52.125 --> 01:55.250
over in bed 4 macrolides and opiates,

01:55.333 --> 01:58.834
2 medications that I guarantee
you are going to make her nauseous.

01:59.417 --> 02:02.125
My patient is fine,
and I don't need you...

02:02.208 --> 02:03.709
(patient throwing up)

02:04.500 --> 02:07.041
I roughly think
that would be the faint sound

02:07.125 --> 02:08.750
of your patient vomiting.

02:08.834 --> 02:10.125
You may be having trouble hearing it

02:10.208 --> 02:13.208
over the much louder sound
of me being right yet again.

02:13.291 --> 02:14.333
Ooh.

02:16.583 --> 02:17.917
Oh, God?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.333
My brilliance is now becoming
a bit of a burden.

02:22.333 --> 02:23.375
Get back to me.

02:24.542 --> 02:27.583
I got to give Mr. Ingram his meds,
so... later.

02:27.667 --> 02:28.542
Later.

02:29.166 --> 02:31.458
That means "I'll be seeing you later."

02:32.041 --> 02:33.875
You want my fiancée,
just go ahead and take her,

02:33.959 --> 02:35.375
'cause she's been naggin'
the crap out of me.

02:35.458 --> 02:37.583
"Pick up your socks, wash your dishes,

02:37.667 --> 02:41.041
stop whispering booyah to J.D.
in the morning after we have sex."

02:41.125 --> 02:42.291
How else am I supposed to know?

02:42.375 --> 02:43.500
I'm sayin'!

02:43.583 --> 02:45.583
But you know what?
I'm not givin' her anymore ammo.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.959
There is no way in hell
that she will ever be able to bust my...

02:48.041 --> 02:49.000
Damn!

02:49.083 --> 02:52.417
Ooh! That ass warrants
the Batman sound effect salute.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.917
-Pow!
-Zap!

02:54.000 --> 02:56.583
Buckle yo... ohh.

02:56.667 --> 02:58.500
Turk, how come every time I turn around

02:58.583 --> 03:00.542
you're checking out
some woman's you-know-what?

03:00.625 --> 03:02.583
-Tushie parts?
-Thanks for having my back.

03:03.834 --> 03:05.041
Babe. Ha ha.

03:06.291 --> 03:08.250
That means now she all mad.

03:09.875 --> 03:13.458
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own ♪</i>

03:13.542 --> 03:16.583
<i>♪ No, I know I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:20.125 --> 03:21.750
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:24.625 --> 03:25.667
(J.D.) <i>When you work in a hospital,</i>

03:25.750 --> 03:28.500
<i>you can count</i>
<i>on an ever-changing roster of new faces,</i>

03:28.583 --> 03:31.000
<i>whether it's the new flower lady</i>
<i>who winks too much</i>

03:32.166 --> 03:34.917
<i>or the plastic surgeon who's returned</i>
<i>after spending 3 years</i>

03:35.000 --> 03:37.083
<i>fixing cleft palates</i>
<i>in third world countries.</i>

03:37.667 --> 03:39.750
So if any of you are interested

03:39.834 --> 03:43.083
in following in the philanthropic
footsteps of Dr. Ramirez,

03:43.166 --> 03:46.417
he has graciously offered
to answer any of your questions.

03:49.417 --> 03:50.959
I told you no one would care.

03:51.625 --> 03:54.458
(J.D.) <i>Sometimes a new face</i>
<i>will just outright surprise you.</i>

03:54.542 --> 03:56.792
(humming)

03:56.875 --> 03:58.375
What the hell are you doing?

03:58.458 --> 04:00.625
Me? Nothin', man.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.834
I'm just waitin' for my brother
to get off work.

04:03.542 --> 04:05.208
(snaps fingers)
Maybe you know him.

04:05.291 --> 04:08.625
He's a janitor here. My name's Rosco.

04:11.375 --> 04:12.250
Why is he doing that?

04:12.333 --> 04:13.542
I think he gets bored.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.250
So I'm supposed to marry someone
who's going to stare at women

04:19.333 --> 04:20.166
for the rest of my life?

04:20.250 --> 04:22.041
Well, I wouldn't put it that way
in your vows.

04:22.125 --> 04:23.792
Let's see how he likes it
when I do it in front of him.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.750
-Hey, honey!
-What's up, baby?

04:25.834 --> 04:27.875
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

04:27.959 --> 04:28.792
It's good, isn't it?

04:28.875 --> 04:30.583
That's because
every time Estelle's working,

04:30.667 --> 04:32.667
she puts extra croutons into the stuffing.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.250
And yet the salads always suffer.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.291
Excuse me.
I am talking about that man's ass!

04:37.375 --> 04:38.375
(beeper rings)

04:39.041 --> 04:39.959
-Gotta go.
-You know,

04:40.041 --> 04:43.333
'cause it's such a fine, chiseled
dig-your-fingernails into it kind of ass.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.375
Babe, he probably works out.

04:47.458 --> 04:49.792
-Carla?
-Ron!

04:49.875 --> 04:51.834
-Hey!
-Hi!

04:51.917 --> 04:53.667
Kudos on the nice pooper.

04:54.291 --> 04:57.083
-Thank you.
-Mine's firm, like mutton.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.458
Lovely.

05:01.542 --> 05:03.542
Okay, Mr. Thompson,
we've got your fever down,

05:03.625 --> 05:05.208
but how's the pain in your abdomen?

05:05.291 --> 05:06.291
Practically gone.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.083
Really? Hunh.

05:08.792 --> 05:10.166
-(motor whirs)
-Aah!

05:10.250 --> 05:12.458
Ha ha.
Little trick I picked up in med school.

05:12.542 --> 05:13.500
Ha ha. Good trick.

05:14.208 --> 05:15.333
I think my insides exploded.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.542
Now I suspect you've got pancreatitis,

05:17.625 --> 05:19.583
so we're going to run some LFTs
and do an ultrasound.

05:19.667 --> 05:20.959
But in the meantime,

05:21.041 --> 05:23.000
I am going to prescribe you
something for your pain.

05:23.083 --> 05:24.583
No, no, no, please, please,
don't sweat it.

05:24.667 --> 05:25.625
I'm used to the pain.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.792
Besides my mom is bringing by
the kids later

05:28.875 --> 05:31.458
and I figure there should be at least
one sober adult in the room.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.542
(laughing)

05:35.625 --> 05:37.291
No, seriously, she's a drunk.

05:37.917 --> 05:39.458
Oh, sorry.

05:39.542 --> 05:43.291
(laughing)

05:43.375 --> 05:44.500
-You!
-Stop it.

05:46.458 --> 05:49.000
(J.D.) <i>There's nothing worse</i>
<i>than being around 2 people with a history.</i>

05:49.083 --> 05:51.959
-So did Shari and Steve ever get married?
-You didn't hear what happened?

05:52.041 --> 05:53.083
(J.D.) <i>Please say you heard.</i>

05:53.166 --> 05:54.500
-No, I didn't.
-(J.D.) <i>Damn you, Ron!</i>

05:54.583 --> 05:56.667
Steve took a year off
to take care of his parents,

05:56.750 --> 05:59.083
and while he was gone,
Shari started seeing Dr. Harding.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.667
-(J.D.) <i>No!</i>
-Really?

06:00.750 --> 06:02.083
-Yes.
-Shari and Gary?

06:02.166 --> 06:03.375
-(J.D.) <i>No.</i>
-Yes.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.709
But that summer,

06:04.792 --> 06:06.709
they took a river-rafting trip
through the Grand Canyon

06:06.792 --> 06:07.667
and they both drowned.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.625
Oh, thank God!

06:13.208 --> 06:14.333
You know, 'cause they...

06:15.375 --> 06:17.875
The both died doing what they loved.

06:20.709 --> 06:21.709
Rafting.

06:25.834 --> 06:27.125
So everybody treating you okay?

06:27.208 --> 06:29.750
Yeah! You know,
the nurse that does the sponge baths,

06:29.834 --> 06:31.500
wouldn't be shocked
if she's killed before.

06:31.583 --> 06:32.917
Hey, sunshine!

06:33.417 --> 06:35.625
Why don't you just calm your ass down?

06:36.375 --> 06:37.542
You was barely bleeding.

06:37.625 --> 06:39.375
From a bath, woman!

06:39.458 --> 06:41.041
Mm-hmm.

06:41.125 --> 06:42.709
I don't get it.
I've run every single test.

06:42.792 --> 06:44.583
I cannot figure out
why this guy is in so much pain.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.875
Did you run a D-U-H test?

06:46.959 --> 06:47.875
What's a D-U-H.?

06:47.959 --> 06:49.542
Uh, duh!

06:49.625 --> 06:53.417
The guy is a drug addict
trying to score painkillers.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.583
But he refused drugs.

06:55.667 --> 07:00.000
My bad. He is a very clever drug addict.

07:00.083 --> 07:03.041
Look, I hate to question
your 3 years of wisdom,

07:03.125 --> 07:06.166
but your pain guy
is just like a million other drug addicts

07:06.250 --> 07:09.667
who walk into hospitals every year
with their aches and their pains

07:09.750 --> 07:13.166
and their spasms and their cramps
and their myalgia and their neuralgia,

07:13.250 --> 07:15.417
and their otalgia or any other algia
they can possibly think of

07:15.500 --> 07:16.917
just so they can get a fix.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.375
Well, I believe in this guy.

07:20.083 --> 07:23.667
Would you like to go out on a limb,
sign him in, keep him overnight?

07:23.750 --> 07:27.875
You know, Dr. Cox, you think
that you have seen it all and done it all,

07:27.959 --> 07:29.125
but guess what?

07:29.208 --> 07:30.583
You haven't done me!

07:31.166 --> 07:32.000
(gasps)

07:32.959 --> 07:34.125
Give her a second there, gang.

07:36.667 --> 07:37.792
That didn't come out right.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.125
(whistles)
Go!

07:41.834 --> 07:44.500
Yo, if you're captain out there today,
pick me first, and then I'll be like,

07:44.583 --> 07:45.792
"Dude, we always play together."

07:45.875 --> 07:47.333
Then you can pick
who you really want to pick,

07:47.417 --> 07:49.291
but everyone else will think
you wanted to pick me first.

07:49.375 --> 07:51.583
-When do you think of that stuff?
-Every minute of every day.

07:51.667 --> 07:54.166
Hey, either of you guys seen
my twin brother?

07:56.959 --> 07:58.583
Hey! I asked you a question.

07:58.667 --> 07:59.959
You're better than this.

08:00.041 --> 08:03.041
(thrilling music playing)

08:10.458 --> 08:11.291
Whoo whoo!

08:13.667 --> 08:15.000
(clatters)

08:19.583 --> 08:20.625
Eeh!

08:22.667 --> 08:24.166
Ooh. Hee hee!

08:24.250 --> 08:25.291
Ooh ahh!

08:26.125 --> 08:27.667
(laughs)

08:28.792 --> 08:30.291
(siren blares)

08:31.291 --> 08:32.875
Whoo!

08:32.959 --> 08:34.583
Aah!
(thuds)

08:34.667 --> 08:35.792
Oh!

08:37.667 --> 08:38.500
(grunts)

08:40.959 --> 08:42.000
Aah, hey!

08:42.792 --> 08:45.375
Any sign of my brother, the janitor?

08:46.125 --> 08:50.000
Dude, there is no way
that we'll ever, ever believe this one.

08:51.625 --> 08:52.458
(sighs)

08:52.875 --> 08:54.583
Can someone say keep rockin'?

08:54.667 --> 08:57.000
<i>♪ Dee Dee Dee belao ♪</i>

08:57.083 --> 08:58.500
<i>♪ Bee beep be deedlao ♪</i>

08:59.166 --> 09:00.375
Oy!

09:02.834 --> 09:06.250
Hey, Carla, after you check
Mrs. Ruck's I.V. in room 310,

09:06.333 --> 09:10.083
can you zip down to the cafeteria
and flirt more with Dr. Hotbutt?

09:10.166 --> 09:13.125
Fine. So I was flirting with him a little.

09:13.208 --> 09:16.041
But I used to have such a crush
on the guy.

09:16.125 --> 09:18.625
And besides, you flirt sometimes.
It's harmless, right?

09:23.709 --> 09:24.625
Can I press your button?

09:25.250 --> 09:27.834
I don't know. Can I press<i> yours?</i>

09:29.166 --> 09:32.542
Aah! Aah! Aah!

09:32.625 --> 09:34.458
(screaming)

09:35.542 --> 09:36.792
It's not always harmless.

09:37.375 --> 09:39.500
Hey, uh, Carla,

09:39.583 --> 09:42.583
I was wondering if you wanted
to grab dinner with me tonight.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.458
(J.D.) <i>It's always a risk</i>
<i>when you go out on a limb.</i>

09:46.041 --> 09:48.083
<i>Ultimately,</i>
<i>you just make yourself vulnerable.</i>

09:48.166 --> 09:50.417
Laverne, did you pull up
Mr. Thompson's old charts?

09:50.500 --> 09:54.542
He was here, like, 8 years ago,
complaining of the same abdominal pain,

09:54.625 --> 09:56.792
but as soon as he was given
his pain medication,

09:56.875 --> 09:58.375
he went A.M.A.

09:58.458 --> 10:00.959
He just took the drugs and bolted?

10:01.041 --> 10:03.667
No, he took some towels, too.

10:04.291 --> 10:05.125
Frick!

10:07.250 --> 10:08.166
So what do you say?

10:08.750 --> 10:11.000
(J.D.) <i>And you just hate to see anyone</i>
<i>get crushed,</i>

10:11.083 --> 10:12.000
<i>even Dr. Hotbutt.</i>

10:12.083 --> 10:14.542
Sure. That sounds great.

10:14.625 --> 10:16.125
(J.D.) <i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

10:22.667 --> 10:24.750
-What the hell just happened?
-I don't know.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.792
He asked me out to dinner and I said yes.
It just came out.

10:29.000 --> 10:29.834
Shame!

10:29.917 --> 10:31.500
Look, everyone thinks it's just guys

10:31.583 --> 10:33.000
who get all freaked out
before the wedding,

10:33.083 --> 10:34.542
but it happens to women, too.

10:35.333 --> 10:36.291
And Ronnie...

10:36.834 --> 10:38.500
-Ronnie?
-Ron. Ron.

10:39.083 --> 10:41.959
He's not just some guy, J.D.
He's my "what if" guy,

10:42.041 --> 10:45.333
the one I always wondered about,
the one I idealized, you know?

10:45.709 --> 10:47.291
If I go out with him and I feel nothing,

10:47.375 --> 10:49.000
you know how confident
I'll feel about Turk?

10:49.750 --> 10:52.709
Now I want you to go.
You know what that means?

10:52.792 --> 10:54.500
<i>That she's a sorceress.</i>

10:54.583 --> 10:57.750
Look, I would never do
anything inappropriate.

10:58.375 --> 11:01.667
-Then you won't mind if I tell Turk?
-If you have to, go ahead.

11:01.750 --> 11:05.542
But then I'll know
that we're not as close as I thought.

11:09.959 --> 11:11.542
Damn beads.

11:13.458 --> 11:15.667
Mr. Thompson, I was just taking a look
at your old charts.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.917
Yes! He was just telling me
that the last time he was here,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.458
his doctor couldn't diagnose him

11:20.542 --> 11:22.709
and just threw a bunch
of painkillers at him instead.

11:23.083 --> 11:23.959
He did?

11:24.041 --> 11:26.041
I was so frustrated, I took off,

11:26.125 --> 11:28.166
but I have to say with Dr. Reid here,

11:28.250 --> 11:30.000
I know we're finally gonna get
to the bottom of things.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.125
She is one terrific doctor.

11:32.875 --> 11:35.125
So this pain you're having
is making you delusional.

11:35.709 --> 11:37.875
No. Why?

11:37.959 --> 11:38.834
No reason.

11:42.667 --> 11:43.917
Well, this is nice,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.333
after all these years
actually being out with you.

11:46.417 --> 11:49.166
-Yeah, so where do you want to sit?
-How about here?

11:57.917 --> 11:59.875
We have a lovely selection of condoms.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.834
Ooh! Lemon zinger!

12:06.625 --> 12:07.709
Uncool.

12:08.625 --> 12:09.750
What were you thinkin' about?

12:11.542 --> 12:13.583
What you'd look like if you were Chinese.

12:13.667 --> 12:14.542
Me, too!

12:14.625 --> 12:15.834
(J.D.) <i>Ooh, that was lucky.</i>

12:16.417 --> 12:17.500
Hey, fellas!

12:17.583 --> 12:19.208
Guess what's on.

12:19.291 --> 12:23.333
A little show that I like to call
<i>Indisputable Evidence.</i>

12:25.291 --> 12:31.083
<i>Thank you, brothers, for inviting me</i>
<i>to your twin birthday party!</i>

12:31.667 --> 12:33.125
(janitor) <i>No problem, Troy.</i>

12:33.208 --> 12:37.417
<i>Hey, brother, why don't you enjoy</i>
<i>this nice pen set that I got for you?</i>

12:38.208 --> 12:39.041
<i>Check it out.</i>

12:39.667 --> 12:40.500
<i>Take your time.</i>

12:44.041 --> 12:45.333
<i>Approach it slowly.</i>

12:46.625 --> 12:49.333
<i>Hey, wow! Thanks, bro!</i>

12:49.417 --> 12:51.709
<i>I'm definitely gonna use this</i>
<i>to write to you</i>

12:51.792 --> 12:54.125
<i>when I finish my around-the-world travels.</i>

12:54.208 --> 12:56.041
<i>Put her there, man.</i>

12:56.125 --> 12:57.041
<i>All right!</i>

12:57.625 --> 12:59.250
<i>You do a good job around here.</i>

13:01.417 --> 13:04.792
And that, boys, is a brotherly handshake.

13:04.875 --> 13:07.000
(J.D.) <i>Sometimes around here,</i>
<i>you can't believe what you're seeing.</i>

13:11.834 --> 13:12.667
(groaning)

13:14.959 --> 13:16.959
(J.D.) <i>Other times, it's as clear as day.</i>

13:20.041 --> 13:20.875
Thanks.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.041
Ohh, great!

13:23.125 --> 13:25.917
You're getting medication
for your "pain patient."

13:26.000 --> 13:27.375
But, say, why stop there?

13:27.458 --> 13:29.917
How's about we load up
our Fanny packs with happy pills,

13:30.000 --> 13:30.917
drive downtown,

13:31.000 --> 13:32.208
I'll hang out of the sunroof

13:32.291 --> 13:35.041
and we can just throw fistfuls of 'em
right at drug addicts

13:35.125 --> 13:36.750
and it'll be like a big, happy parade?

13:36.834 --> 13:39.667
Aah! Aah!

13:39.750 --> 13:40.875
You know what's amazing about you?

13:40.959 --> 13:43.458
You have this unbelievable ability
to make me doubt myself.

13:43.542 --> 13:46.709
I don't think I could possibly make you
doubt yourself,

13:46.792 --> 13:49.291
you rascal,
unless you had the unnatural talent

13:49.375 --> 13:51.333
for being wrong most of the time.

13:51.417 --> 13:53.083
Well, I'm not wrong.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.291
I just saw Mr. Thompson writhing in pain,

13:55.375 --> 13:57.083
and he had no idea
that I was watching him.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.500
But you probably don't care about that

13:58.583 --> 14:02.166
because you're more concerned with being
right than doing what's right, aren't you?

14:05.208 --> 14:07.959
(J.D.) <i>Stay calm. Turk's never</i>
<i>going to find out about her date.</i>

14:08.041 --> 14:08.917
-(Turk) Hey!
-Aah!

14:09.000 --> 14:10.709
-You got a minute to talk?
-I got lots of time to talk.

14:10.792 --> 14:12.458
Do you want to talk
about anything… anything... hours.

14:12.542 --> 14:14.625
We can talk about our feelings.
What's up?

14:14.709 --> 14:17.792
Look, I've been thinking about
this whole Carla nagging me thing, right?

14:17.875 --> 14:20.959
And I know it's coming form a good place
because, well, let's face it.

14:21.041 --> 14:22.500
The woman lives and dies for me.

14:25.750 --> 14:30.000
(giggling)

14:30.583 --> 14:31.500
Mmm.

14:31.583 --> 14:32.500
More wine?

14:32.583 --> 14:34.208
Oh, God, yes.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.208
So I'm supposed to marry someone
who's gonna bust my chops

14:37.291 --> 14:39.792
every time I look at a woman
for the rest of my life?

14:39.875 --> 14:41.667
Well, I wouldn't put it that way
in your vows.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.291
-Hand me that?
-Here you go.

14:46.041 --> 14:48.667
So you and that girl Kelly
finally broke up, huh?

14:48.750 --> 14:51.834
Yeah. What was that cute name
that you used to call her?

14:51.917 --> 14:53.250
Skunk face.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.375
I was a little mean back then.

14:56.458 --> 14:59.625
No. I always used to think
you were the sweetest girl on Earth.

15:01.083 --> 15:05.166
Nag, nag, nag, nag.
You see how Carla is lately.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.250
I mean,
is that all I have to look forward to?

15:08.041 --> 15:10.000
I hear they're coming out
with a<i> Stuart Little 3.</i>

15:10.083 --> 15:12.709
No, it's on hold.
The director dropped out.

15:12.792 --> 15:14.208
Turk, don't you have any work to do?

15:14.291 --> 15:16.458
Dude, surgeon.

15:17.542 --> 15:20.041
Beads, keep me strong.

15:20.125 --> 15:21.041
-What?
-Nothing.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.792
-So I'm so glad we did this.
-Oh, me, too.

15:26.166 --> 15:28.208
You know, I have to leave
for a lecture tour Monday,

15:28.291 --> 15:31.375
but I'll be back the last week in April,
so maybe we can get together then.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.959
I'm getting married April 24.

15:35.041 --> 15:38.208
So then our plans totally interfere
with your honeymoon.

15:38.291 --> 15:39.542
A little bit.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.125
Excited about it?

15:41.750 --> 15:43.083
I'm so excited.

15:46.083 --> 15:49.417
Mr. Thompson, I've decided I'd like
to prescribe you something for the pain.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.000
Well, you know, that's your call.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.542
There's just one little problem.

15:53.625 --> 15:56.959
Oh, my God!
Just give me the drugs, 'k, lady?

15:57.041 --> 15:59.458
For god's sake, I've been working you
from every possible angle.

15:59.542 --> 16:00.875
I refused painkillers.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.709
I did the
"you're the greatest doctor" bit,

16:02.792 --> 16:03.709
which I know you loved.

16:03.792 --> 16:05.917
Then somewhere between getting a tube
in my ass

16:06.000 --> 16:08.875
and a tube in my mouth, which by the way,
I'm still praying wasn't the same tube,

16:08.959 --> 16:11.333
I found time to do the whole
"I'm writhing in pain,

16:11.417 --> 16:12.792
but I don't know
if you're watching me thing."

16:12.875 --> 16:15.458
So please or pretty please
or however you want me to say it, doctor,

16:15.542 --> 16:17.083
why don't you say it,
why don't you say it,

16:17.166 --> 16:19.750
why don't you tell me
what the problem is and say it?

16:21.125 --> 16:25.041
Um, I was just going to say
that my pen doesn't work

16:25.125 --> 16:27.583
and needed a new one
to write out your dosage.

16:28.333 --> 16:29.166
Oh.

16:30.500 --> 16:31.542
Awesome.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.041
(whistles)

16:33.125 --> 16:38.166
(Irish jig playing)

16:40.500 --> 16:42.709
I felt nothing for him. How cool is that?

16:42.792 --> 16:44.458
I had a dream just like this,

16:44.542 --> 16:47.291
except I had a saddle on my back
and you were an Indian.

16:47.959 --> 16:49.417
Turk was a donkey.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.083
I'm gonna go tell Turk.

16:52.166 --> 16:53.500
(J.D.) <i>Oh, that's great.</i>

16:53.583 --> 16:55.375
<i>She's gonna go... Wait. What?</i>

16:59.041 --> 17:00.208
(muffled scream)

17:01.792 --> 17:04.458
Whatever you do, don't scream.

17:05.667 --> 17:06.834
Why would I scream?

17:07.250 --> 17:09.333
I don't know.
People always say that in the movies.

17:09.875 --> 17:13.125
Anyway, I don't Turk's gonna be as excited
about your big date as you are, all right?

17:13.208 --> 17:15.667
He definitely won't love the fact
that I knew about it,

17:16.250 --> 17:18.792
so just tell him in 5 years.

17:19.417 --> 17:20.959
You did what?

17:24.125 --> 17:25.709
Make that 20 years.

17:27.333 --> 17:29.291
Honey, that was a long time ago.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.000
Why are you still living here?

17:32.083 --> 17:34.208
Because I've got nowhere else to go!

17:35.458 --> 17:36.291
(farts)

17:36.792 --> 17:37.625
Sorry.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.375
But still, what if I want to tell him?

17:41.458 --> 17:43.458
Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

17:44.375 --> 17:45.208
Got to go.

17:48.291 --> 17:49.250
Damn beads.

17:56.208 --> 17:59.166
(giggling)

17:59.250 --> 18:00.750
Yuck it up. I don't care.

18:00.834 --> 18:02.125
I'm getting the last laugh,

18:02.709 --> 18:04.333
'cause my brother's waiting for me
downstairs.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.667
And when these elevator doors open,
you'll see.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.166
He's gonna be staring right at you 2 guys.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.083
(dings)

18:13.166 --> 18:14.834
Okay, I don't know
what I thought was going to happen.

18:14.917 --> 18:16.792
Look, I think we can all agree
this isn't working out.

18:16.875 --> 18:18.583
It's cost me a tremendous amount
of time and effort,

18:18.667 --> 18:20.542
so let's just call it a draw.

18:20.625 --> 18:23.083
Hell, no! You lost. Live with it.

18:23.166 --> 18:25.583
(J.D.) <i>It's hard when you lose</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

18:26.166 --> 18:28.250
<i>It's even harder</i>
<i>when it's the hundredth time.</i>

18:28.333 --> 18:30.000
Say it.

18:30.875 --> 18:33.125
-You're always right.
-I know!

18:33.208 --> 18:35.458
But it is still so nice to hear it.

18:36.291 --> 18:37.625
How did you know that he was lying?

18:37.709 --> 18:40.166
Well, you said that he wasn't,

18:40.250 --> 18:42.709
and, as a rule,
I always take whatever you say

18:42.792 --> 18:44.500
and just go in the exact
opposite direction with it.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.709
But more than that, Barbie,
the main reason is because...

18:47.792 --> 18:51.166
Well, look it,
medicine is all about experience.

18:51.250 --> 18:54.792
I mean, hell, would you...
Would you like to go ahead and have a look

18:54.875 --> 18:58.166
at who the last doctor was
to give Thompson drugs?

18:59.709 --> 19:01.166
-You?
-Oh!

19:01.792 --> 19:03.834
Why didn't you say something earlier?

19:03.917 --> 19:07.083
What, give up my front row seat
to <i>Barbie's Wild Ride?</i>

19:07.166 --> 19:09.291
He's a drug addict,
he's not a drug addict.

19:09.375 --> 19:12.792
You... make... me... doubt... myself.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.875
(mock crying)

19:16.583 --> 19:20.291
(Whining) You're more interested
in being right than doing what's right!

19:20.375 --> 19:22.667
And I don't even think
I can take it anymore!

19:22.750 --> 19:26.000
Everybody in this whole hospital...

19:26.083 --> 19:28.333
I'm just fed up with the whole thing!

19:30.041 --> 19:32.291
(J.D.)<i> And yet sometimes,</i>
<i>losing is a good thing.</i>

19:34.166 --> 19:36.250
<i>Like, for instance,</i>
<i>when you lose your insecurities</i>

19:36.333 --> 19:37.458
<i>about the guy you're marrying,</i>

19:37.542 --> 19:40.333
<i>which makes it a whole lot easier</i>
<i>to cut him some slack once in a while.</i>

19:40.417 --> 19:41.291
Go ahead, look.

19:41.750 --> 19:43.000
-Really, baby?
-Yeah.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.834
Besides, you're cutting up your napkin.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.250
(J.D.) <i>I guess you can never underestimate</i>

19:51.333 --> 19:54.417
<i>how the smallest gesture</i>
<i>can make everything better.</i>

19:54.500 --> 19:57.458
You know, for a minute there,
I actually thought you had a twin brother.

19:57.917 --> 19:58.959
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:59.750 --> 20:02.083
-Was it when my twin brother was here?
-Stop it.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.000
Sorry.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.333
Too much.

20:15.125 --> 20:19.250
(closing theme music playing)
