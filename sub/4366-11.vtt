WEBVTT

00:01.555 --> 00:02.899
You are being watched.

00:04.181 --> 00:06.132
The government has
a secret system,

00:06.369 --> 00:07.429
a machine

00:07.624 --> 00:10.189
that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.104
I know, because I built it.

00:13.106 --> 00:15.440
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:15.442 --> 00:17.325
but it sees everything...

00:17.327 --> 00:20.078
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.529
People like you.

00:21.531 --> 00:25.200
Crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:25.202 --> 00:28.486
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:28.488 --> 00:30.422
But I needed a partner--

00:30.424 --> 00:33.124
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:33.126 --> 00:37.262
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:37.264 --> 00:39.264
You will never find us.

00:39.266 --> 00:41.266
But victim or perpetrator,

00:41.268 --> 00:44.085
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

00:44.699 --> 00:49.328
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

00:51.110 --> 00:54.029
Got eyes on Reese.
Kill the cameras.

00:54.031 --> 00:57.949
Time to come home, John.
Slate's been wiped clean.

00:57.951 --> 00:59.534
You know that'll never happen.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.799 --> 01:17.552
Third one tonight.
Must be a full moon.

01:21.223 --> 01:22.507
Your name is Farouk Madani.

01:22.509 --> 01:24.392
You were the best
surgeon in Najaf,

01:24.394 --> 01:25.960
but you can't afford
a license in the States

01:25.962 --> 01:29.931
because you send
all your money home to family.

01:35.655 --> 01:38.690
Stitch him up--
No questions asked--

01:38.692 --> 01:41.443
and you can be a doctor again.

02:21.650 --> 02:23.851
Police. Everybody out.

02:24.788 --> 02:27.238
NYPD!
Come out of there!

02:27.240 --> 02:30.692
There a problem, detective?

02:34.413 --> 02:39.417
Are you guys this sloppy
when you tail Al-Qaeda?

02:40.503 --> 02:43.304
Cute place.
You gonna be out for a while?

02:43.306 --> 02:46.474
Right, this isn't you
being sloppy at all.

02:46.476 --> 02:48.376
This is you making a point.

02:48.378 --> 02:50.044
You're the only person
we know of who's had any contact

02:50.046 --> 02:51.379
- with our boy.
- If I hear from him,

02:51.381 --> 02:53.732
you'll be the first to know,
but all this?

02:53.734 --> 02:56.568
- Unnecessary.
- Is it?

02:56.570 --> 02:59.053
You know, I was really surprised
he was able to slip away.

02:59.055 --> 03:01.356
Just can't figure out
how he did it.

03:01.358 --> 03:04.275
It's not my case anymore,
so you have fun with that.

03:04.277 --> 03:08.329
I don't like this
any more than you do, Carter.

03:08.331 --> 03:09.914
Watching someone night and day,

03:09.916 --> 03:11.533
you never know
what you'll dig up.

03:11.535 --> 03:16.087
I've seen it ruin
careers, families.

03:16.089 --> 03:20.091
Threatening a police officer
is against the law, Mr. Snow.

03:20.093 --> 03:22.627
So is lying to a federal agent.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.799
I'll be seeing you.

04:02.835 --> 04:06.221
Okay, where would you keep...

04:20.319 --> 04:22.270
This guy's his partner,
and it turns out

04:22.272 --> 04:24.989
I've had his cell phone number
for weeks now.

04:28.945 --> 04:32.680
The number you have reached
is not in service.

04:35.334 --> 04:38.036
You're gonna use my computer,
you gotta do my reports too.

04:38.038 --> 04:40.171
Hi, Detective Carter, NYPD.

04:40.173 --> 04:42.707
I need all
the locations data you've got

04:42.709 --> 04:44.709
on a disconnected cell phone.

04:44.711 --> 04:47.095
Yeah, name's
"Burdett, Norman."

04:47.097 --> 04:50.882
917-555-0131.

04:50.884 --> 04:52.150
So who's this guy?

04:52.152 --> 04:53.968
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.324
I thought these folks
were just for your boss.

05:16.326 --> 05:18.693
Sorry about all
the cloak-and-dagger.

05:18.695 --> 05:20.795
So what brings you up from DC?

05:20.797 --> 05:22.580
You.

05:22.582 --> 05:25.333
I'm flattered, Alicia.
Don't be.

05:25.335 --> 05:26.885
My people want answers.

05:26.887 --> 05:30.471
Your company has had the NSA
feeds for three years.

05:30.473 --> 05:32.390
Not my company, just me.

05:32.392 --> 05:35.643
If congress knew about
this machine you're building,

05:35.645 --> 05:38.379
about the unfettered access
we've given you

05:38.381 --> 05:41.149
to all the data we're compiling
on U.S. citizens,

05:41.151 --> 05:44.152
you wouldn't just be shut down.
You would go to jail.

05:44.154 --> 05:48.723
I don't suppose
they'd let us be cell mates.

05:48.725 --> 05:52.277
We need progress, Nathan,
or we're pulling the plug.

05:54.113 --> 05:57.365
- What's this?
- It's progress.

05:57.367 --> 06:01.419
- Nine digits?
- You work in intelligence.

06:01.421 --> 06:03.070
Figure it out.

06:06.842 --> 06:09.127
For once, I'd like you
to handle one of these meetings

06:09.129 --> 06:11.045
while I lurk in the shadows.

06:11.047 --> 06:14.632
You couldn't lurk if you tried.

06:14.634 --> 06:18.269
That number we gave her...
It better pan out.

06:18.271 --> 06:20.638
It will.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.608
How?

06:23.610 --> 06:27.362
I don't know.
But the machine does.

06:27.364 --> 06:31.332
- Have a little faith, Nathan.
- In you or in the machine?

06:48.584 --> 06:51.636
Okay, Mr. Hayes,
this is the place.

06:51.638 --> 06:53.137
Watch your step-- Uh...

06:53.139 --> 06:55.790
Not your step, I mean--
It's just one of those things

06:55.792 --> 06:58.125
people say, you know?
No-- no offense.

06:58.127 --> 07:01.262
But we got ramps all over the
place, so if you need anything--

07:01.264 --> 07:03.314
I'll be on my feet
in a few days.

07:03.316 --> 07:05.767
Yeah, but if anything
goes wrong, you call me.

07:05.769 --> 07:09.103
I'm the super.
Name is Trask.

07:09.105 --> 07:11.906
- I tell you that already?
- Twice.

07:11.908 --> 07:13.491
I guess I'm getting old.

07:13.493 --> 07:15.526
It seems like yesterday
I was partying till dawn

07:15.528 --> 07:17.178
down in Miami.

07:17.180 --> 07:20.031
Used to own six nightclubs
down there.

07:20.033 --> 07:21.749
You know, I had a mansion
in coral gables,

07:21.751 --> 07:24.702
a white bengal tiger...
Had to give all that up.

07:24.704 --> 07:27.372
Bad for my health.
What about you?

07:27.374 --> 07:29.824
Where you from?
What do you do?

07:29.826 --> 07:31.592
How'd you wind up
in that chair?

07:31.594 --> 07:33.294
I had a rough night.

07:33.296 --> 07:36.014
Okay.

07:36.016 --> 07:38.933
Here are the keys.
You need anything,

07:38.935 --> 07:40.501
my number's on that lease.

07:40.503 --> 07:44.722
The name is--
Well, you know.

07:52.981 --> 07:55.199
Everything satisfactory,
Mr. Reese?

07:55.201 --> 07:58.152
Nice place.

07:58.154 --> 08:00.405
You really shouldn't have gone
to this much trouble, though.

08:00.407 --> 08:02.740
No trouble-- I thought
you'd get tired of hotels,

08:02.742 --> 08:07.295
and, in your condition,
I felt that something a bit more

08:07.297 --> 08:09.831
low-profile was in order.

08:09.833 --> 08:12.550
Where's our pal Snow?

08:12.552 --> 08:14.919
Preoccupied with detective
Carter at the moment.

08:14.921 --> 08:16.938
She all right?

08:16.940 --> 08:18.556
Not that I don't share
your concern for the woman

08:18.558 --> 08:20.591
who tried to hand you
over to the CIA--

08:20.593 --> 08:24.095
She did let us go.
Just...

08:24.097 --> 08:26.097
Keep an eye on her
for me for a while,

08:26.099 --> 08:27.849
while I'm resting up.

08:27.851 --> 08:31.903
About that...

08:31.905 --> 08:33.888
I'm not here to rest, am I?

08:33.890 --> 08:36.573
I'm afraid the machine
waits for no man.

08:36.576 --> 08:39.260
So who's the next number
on your list?

08:39.261 --> 08:42.229
- You just met him.
- The super?

08:42.231 --> 08:44.832
Mr. James,
got that shower head for you.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.751
- Thanks.
- How you doing, Mrs. Park?

08:46.753 --> 08:48.169
Oh, fine, thanks.

08:48.171 --> 08:49.904
Ease up on the phone, Aaron.
It'll nuke your brain.

08:49.906 --> 08:51.238
Yeah, thanks, Ernie.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.041
Lily the cook,
I love how you look.

08:54.043 --> 08:56.344
Thanks, Ernie.
You write that one yourself?

08:56.346 --> 08:58.463
Ernest P. Trask,
51 years old.

08:58.465 --> 09:02.266
Born in Goodland, Florida,
population 394.

09:02.268 --> 09:04.719
Small towns
aren't exactly paragons

09:04.721 --> 09:06.971
of digital record-keeping,
but I did verify

09:06.973 --> 09:08.523
he got a high school diploma.

09:08.525 --> 09:12.944
Let me guess.
No nightclubs, no mansions,

09:12.946 --> 09:14.612
no pet tigers?

09:14.614 --> 09:16.948
Mr. Trask seems to have
a vivid imagination.

09:16.950 --> 09:19.700
Don't you have
anything to unpack?

09:19.702 --> 09:21.435
I travel light.

09:21.437 --> 09:25.039
- Any idea what the threat is?
- Not yet.

09:25.041 --> 09:26.741
He's been super for 14 years.

09:26.743 --> 09:28.943
Lives and works
in the same place.

09:28.945 --> 09:30.778
So whatever's
gonna happen with Trask,

09:30.780 --> 09:34.715
it will probably happen here.

09:34.717 --> 09:36.667
How many people
in the building?

09:36.669 --> 09:39.804
- 241.
- So 241 suspects?

09:39.806 --> 09:43.007
Or maybe just one.

09:43.009 --> 09:46.394
I took the liberty of hacking
into Trask's online phone bill.

09:46.396 --> 09:48.763
He called three pawn shops
last week,

09:48.765 --> 09:51.482
the kind that specialize
in off-the-books sales

09:51.484 --> 09:54.685
of untraceable handguns.

09:54.687 --> 09:56.971
Trask might be planning
to kill somebody.

10:20.175 --> 10:23.427
- You didn't get me anything?
- Coffee's for closers.

10:23.429 --> 10:25.513
I got you a clear shot
at Reese and you whiffed.

10:25.515 --> 10:28.132
I wasn't aiming to kill.
You said you wanted

10:28.134 --> 10:29.934
to question him
about what happened in Ordos.

10:29.936 --> 10:31.785
If possible.

10:31.787 --> 10:34.889
Secondary objective.

10:34.891 --> 10:36.223
What's she up to?

10:36.225 --> 10:38.926
Near as we can tell?
Catching up on paperwork.

10:38.928 --> 10:42.196
She's not using
her computer or phones.

10:42.198 --> 10:43.430
Reese?

10:43.432 --> 10:45.232
We got people checking
every hospital, clinic,

10:45.234 --> 10:47.151
and morgue
in a 300-mile radius.

10:47.153 --> 10:50.821
If anybody stitched him up,
we'll pick up the scent.

10:50.823 --> 10:52.773
I hope you don't mind,
but in addition

10:52.775 --> 10:56.210
to the necessary hardware,
I brought a few books

10:56.212 --> 10:59.046
for you to read...

10:59.048 --> 11:02.299
And a little housewarming gift.

11:04.953 --> 11:06.921
- Thanks.
- You want to try it out?

11:06.923 --> 11:10.341
Oh, no.
I'm-- I'm good for now.

11:10.343 --> 11:13.928
You'll thank me later.

11:13.930 --> 11:16.180
You know, Trask may seem
like a harmless bag of wind,

11:16.182 --> 11:17.464
but I've been fooled before.

11:17.466 --> 11:20.985
If he bought a gun,
I'd just like to know why.

11:20.987 --> 11:23.654
Only one way to find out.

11:23.656 --> 11:25.773
We're going to hack
his wi-fi?

11:25.775 --> 11:27.825
We're gonna hack all of them.

11:27.827 --> 11:28.943
If the threat's
in the building,

11:28.945 --> 11:30.310
we should get to know
our neighbors.

11:30.312 --> 11:32.563
You're into
16 networks already?

11:32.565 --> 11:34.832
When the phone company
puts in your wi-fi,

11:34.834 --> 11:36.166
the password
is your phone number.

11:36.168 --> 11:37.701
Most people never
even change it.

11:37.703 --> 11:42.039
The other ones might
actually take a minute.

11:42.041 --> 11:44.959
Once we're in, we can turn
every webcam, nanny cam,

11:44.961 --> 11:47.695
security system,
and laptop on the network

11:47.697 --> 11:49.380
into our eyes and ears.

11:49.382 --> 11:53.100
- Just like the machine.
- I suppose...

11:53.102 --> 11:57.054
If one apartment building
were the entire world.

11:59.641 --> 12:02.026
Well, Lily the cook
seems to be dating Rick

12:02.028 --> 12:03.944
- from the penthouse.
- Hmm.

12:03.946 --> 12:07.765
And Amber in 714 is...

12:07.767 --> 12:09.450
Healthy.

12:09.452 --> 12:12.403
Somehow I doubt
that's what alerted the machine.

12:14.689 --> 12:16.356
Got one, Finch.

12:16.358 --> 12:19.543
Doug Stanley, security guard.

12:19.545 --> 12:21.862
He's been hunting a thief
who's been stealing jewelry

12:21.864 --> 12:23.213
out of women's apartments.

12:23.215 --> 12:26.533
Maybe Trask is the thief
planning to kill Doug,

12:26.535 --> 12:27.751
to cover his crimes.

12:27.753 --> 12:29.336
Or Trask knows who the thief is

12:29.338 --> 12:31.338
and now they're planning
to kill him.

12:31.340 --> 12:33.724
That's the landlord, Alan Holt.

12:33.726 --> 12:37.194
Doesn't look like Trask
is the employee of the month.

12:37.196 --> 12:41.315
Maybe he's about to snap
and kill his boss?

12:45.887 --> 12:48.155
Why did the machine
give us his number?

12:48.157 --> 12:50.574
Is Trask in trouble...

12:50.576 --> 12:52.225
Or is he the problem?

12:52.227 --> 12:54.111
Well, you're not gonna
get it staring at the wall.

12:54.113 --> 12:55.946
We need to do some legwork.

12:59.618 --> 13:01.068
Right.

13:05.957 --> 13:08.125
I'm in position.
Make it quick, please.

13:08.127 --> 13:11.411
Mr. Trask,
it's John Hayes in 521.

13:11.413 --> 13:14.848
- I'm having a bit of a problem.
- I'll be right there.

13:16.084 --> 13:19.269
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

13:36.454 --> 13:38.405
I've planted
the cameras, Mr. Reese.

13:38.407 --> 13:39.873
I'm starting to search.

13:39.875 --> 13:43.127
I haven't seen damage
like this since hurricane Opal

13:43.129 --> 13:46.080
trashed my yacht.

13:46.082 --> 13:49.550
Looks like somebody
went at this with a hammer.

13:49.552 --> 13:53.754
No sign of a gun.

13:56.057 --> 13:59.593
But I doubt if he's
just a collector of bullets.

13:59.595 --> 14:01.011
So who does he want to shoot?

14:01.013 --> 14:03.647
Of course,
I didn't bring the right one.

14:03.649 --> 14:06.650
I'll be right back.

14:06.652 --> 14:08.185
Trask needs
a pipe wrench, Finch.

14:08.187 --> 14:12.472
- He's coming back down.
- Okay, just a minute.

14:14.359 --> 14:18.245
Finch, he's in the courtyard
headed your way.

14:19.665 --> 14:21.448
Watch where
you're going, Trask.

14:21.450 --> 14:24.251
Finch.

14:24.253 --> 14:26.370
He's obsessed with her.

14:26.372 --> 14:27.621
I'm afraid we're not
the only ones

14:27.623 --> 14:29.322
spying on our neighbors,
Mr. Reese.

14:29.324 --> 14:31.725
Harold, get out of there now.

14:48.292 --> 14:50.293
Finch,
did you get out of there?

14:50.295 --> 14:52.494
Finch?

14:57.434 --> 14:59.352
Who the hell--

14:59.354 --> 15:00.436
Hey! Come here!

15:00.438 --> 15:03.723
What were you doing
in my place?

15:03.725 --> 15:05.191
I could use a hand here.

15:05.193 --> 15:08.277
Okay, hang on,
hang on, hang on.

15:08.279 --> 15:11.897
Okay, he's gonna
kill the elevator.

15:14.951 --> 15:17.036
Security, this is Trask.

15:17.038 --> 15:18.621
Finch,
he's in the west stairwell.

15:18.623 --> 15:20.489
Turn right,
take the east stairs up

15:20.491 --> 15:22.074
three flights and you're home.

15:22.076 --> 15:24.794
But move quick, he'll be on
your floor in about 40 seconds.

15:24.796 --> 15:27.630
I feel like a rat in a maze.

15:27.632 --> 15:31.000
How do you put up with this?

15:31.002 --> 15:33.336
Doug, I just caught
a guy breaking in.

15:33.338 --> 15:34.920
He was just in my apartment.

15:34.922 --> 15:37.423
Keep walking, Finch.
You'll be fine.

15:37.425 --> 15:40.059
5'9", glasses.
He walks with a limp.

15:40.061 --> 15:44.063
I think he might be that thief
you've been looking for.

15:44.065 --> 15:46.932
Hey.

15:50.237 --> 15:53.689
What was that security guard
doing in that apartment?

15:58.028 --> 15:59.395
Finch...

16:02.749 --> 16:05.167
I'm pretty sure Doug
knows you're not the thief.

16:05.169 --> 16:06.836
He is.

16:06.838 --> 16:08.254
And I'm sending you the proof.

16:08.256 --> 16:11.791
- Nice phone.
- Can I show you something?

16:15.011 --> 16:16.962
Doug, is he up there?
Have you found him yet?

16:16.964 --> 16:18.631
So we can call the police...

16:18.633 --> 16:21.934
Or you can forget you saw me,
and I'll forget I saw you.

16:21.936 --> 16:25.688
I'm gonna check the next floor.

16:25.690 --> 16:31.143
He's not on two.

16:33.480 --> 16:37.483
So Trask is armed, has
a dangerous fixation on Lily,

16:37.485 --> 16:39.268
and he just chased me
up three floors.

16:39.270 --> 16:41.237
Safe to say
he's our perpetrator.

16:41.239 --> 16:43.038
I don't know, Finch.
Sure you don't want to

16:43.040 --> 16:44.440
double-check
with your machine?

16:44.442 --> 16:47.543
Yes, that joke <i>never</i> gets old.

16:58.004 --> 17:00.956
Harold, is everything okay?

17:04.560 --> 17:07.146
What the hell?

17:07.147 --> 17:10.299
We have company.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.851
Sorry to pop up
unannounced, Nate.

17:11.853 --> 17:14.019
I guess we're not
doing this over drinks.

17:17.491 --> 17:19.442
He works here.

17:19.444 --> 17:23.695
Even I need
technical support sometimes.

17:26.483 --> 17:31.203
Nathan, you remember
Deputy Director Weeks.

17:33.656 --> 17:37.793
The man in charge.
I hope I'm not in trouble.

17:37.795 --> 17:41.497
The nine digits you gave us
are the social security number

17:41.499 --> 17:45.351
of a man named Gordon Kurzweil.
He's one of ours.

17:45.353 --> 17:49.505
He's a DIA case officer.
Top secret clearance.

17:49.507 --> 17:52.558
Been acing FBI background
checks for 20 years.

17:52.560 --> 17:56.345
We surveilled Kurzweil
for two weeks, got nothing.

17:56.347 --> 17:57.696
And just when we were
thinking that you'd sold us

17:57.698 --> 18:00.182
a bill of goods,
he breaks pattern.

18:00.184 --> 18:01.534
Goes for a drive.

18:01.536 --> 18:05.638
At a park in Bethesda, a Syrian
businessman drops his phone.

18:05.640 --> 18:09.742
Kurzweil picks it up,
and via coded SMS,

18:09.744 --> 18:13.379
he arranges to sell 26 pounds
of weapons-grade uranium

18:13.381 --> 18:16.632
to the iranian government.

18:16.634 --> 18:18.167
So I guess
the number panned out?

18:18.169 --> 18:21.637
What I need you
to explain to me is...

18:21.639 --> 18:25.457
How did some damn
computer program spot a traitor

18:25.459 --> 18:27.426
when federal agents couldn't?

18:27.428 --> 18:30.095
Honestly?
Not a clue.

18:30.097 --> 18:32.898
The machine will deliver
actionable intelligence

18:32.900 --> 18:35.484
in time to thwart any threat
to national security,

18:35.486 --> 18:38.437
but its operating system
is a black box.

18:38.439 --> 18:42.591
And if we want to direct this
machine at a specific target?

18:42.593 --> 18:43.725
No need.

18:43.727 --> 18:45.778
It already watches
every target.

18:45.780 --> 18:49.064
You're asking us to take
a lot on faith here, Nathan.

18:49.066 --> 18:52.034
A piece of software
we can't inspect,

18:52.036 --> 18:53.786
can't control or modify,

18:53.788 --> 18:56.205
that only feeds us intel
when it feels like it?

18:56.207 --> 18:58.740
When it perceives a threat.

18:58.742 --> 19:01.794
Look, I'm sorry, folks,
but it's the only way

19:01.796 --> 19:03.679
that we can keep it
and us protected.

19:03.681 --> 19:06.081
If no human sees
what the machine sees,

19:06.083 --> 19:08.417
then technically,

19:08.419 --> 19:10.386
no one's fourth amendment rights
have been violated.

19:10.388 --> 19:12.555
Why don't you just focus
on your computer, Mr. Ingram,

19:12.557 --> 19:14.373
and leave the constitutional
concerns to us?

19:14.375 --> 19:17.643
Because I'm a citizen too,
and I'm a lot more comfortable

19:17.645 --> 19:20.646
having this machine
watch my every move

19:20.648 --> 19:23.582
than someone like you.

19:23.584 --> 19:26.986
So it will remain
a closed system,

19:26.988 --> 19:28.904
fully autonomous?

19:28.906 --> 19:32.491
All we get is a number?

19:32.493 --> 19:34.260
Did you need more than
a number to pick up Kurzweil?

19:34.262 --> 19:37.830
The software told you to take
a closer look, so you did.

19:37.832 --> 19:39.965
It's a black box.

19:39.967 --> 19:42.551
That's the deal.
Take it or leave it.

19:42.553 --> 19:46.088
I'm not accustomed to having
contractors dictate terms.

19:46.090 --> 19:49.008
If you're going to be
supplying crippled software,

19:49.010 --> 19:52.678
maybe we need to revisit
the question of price.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.514
Why don't you tell him
the price negotiated, Alicia?

19:55.516 --> 19:58.851
Mr. Ingram felt
that this project was his duty

19:58.853 --> 20:02.104
as a citizen,
not a businessman.

20:02.106 --> 20:08.110
He's building the machine
for one U.S. dollar.

20:10.530 --> 20:12.698
I suppose
I don't have a choice.

20:16.620 --> 20:19.288
I know, I know.

20:31.718 --> 20:34.386
I don't know
what to do anymore,

20:34.388 --> 20:37.473
how else to say no.
He's always right there.

20:37.475 --> 20:41.727
Even when I can't see him,
I can feel his eyes on me.

20:43.647 --> 20:47.199
It's a bump key.

20:47.201 --> 20:48.567
A hardware hack.

20:48.569 --> 20:53.122
Just stick it in, twist,
give it a little jolt...

20:53.124 --> 20:54.856
And it'll open any lock
in the building.

20:54.858 --> 21:00.362
You won't be caught
with nowhere to run again.

21:00.364 --> 21:02.197
And this is everything
you've found on the woman

21:02.199 --> 21:03.916
that Trask is obsessed with?

21:03.918 --> 21:05.534
Uh-huh.

21:05.536 --> 21:07.369
Lily Thornton.
Grew up in Georgia

21:07.371 --> 21:11.557
cooking in her dad's diner.
Cordon Bleu, class of '05.

21:11.559 --> 21:14.876
Staying in her great aunt's
apartment since '09

21:14.878 --> 21:18.514
and currently a rising star
at a top Manhattan bistro.

21:18.516 --> 21:21.083
Romantically linked
to Rick Morris,

21:21.085 --> 21:24.353
a powerful restaurateur.

21:24.355 --> 21:25.904
This is very nice work,
Mr. Reese.

21:25.906 --> 21:28.557
Well, I have used
a computer before.

21:28.559 --> 21:31.226
But we can't get video
from her place.

21:31.228 --> 21:34.062
She changes her
wi-fi password every day.

21:34.064 --> 21:36.498
Random alphanumerics.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.168
You gotta love a girl
with good security habits.

21:39.170 --> 21:41.487
So Trask has been
snapping pictures of her.

21:41.489 --> 21:44.907
Are we sure that means
he wants to kill her?

21:44.909 --> 21:48.910
76% of all female
homicide victims are stalked

21:48.912 --> 21:50.679
before they're murdered.

21:54.517 --> 21:56.351
Well, I better
keep an eye on her then.

21:56.353 --> 21:57.770
You're not tailing her to work?

21:57.772 --> 22:01.390
I'm getting
pretty good at this thing.

22:01.392 --> 22:03.225
Yes, I'm sure the CIA
will be deeply impressed

22:03.227 --> 22:04.777
when they shoot you.

22:04.779 --> 22:07.146
Just feeling a little
restless here, Finch.

22:07.148 --> 22:10.766
Use the cushion.

22:12.268 --> 22:14.903
The numbers never stop
coming in, Finch.

22:14.905 --> 22:16.438
What are we gonna do
if another one comes in

22:16.440 --> 22:19.408
while I'm sidelined?

22:19.410 --> 22:21.293
I'm sure
I'd think of something.

22:21.295 --> 22:23.162
And I know you
won't carry a gun,

22:23.164 --> 22:25.164
but if I'm sending you
back in the field,

22:25.166 --> 22:27.299
you're getting some
basic self-defense.

22:27.301 --> 22:28.917
- Oh, I really don't think--
- No, listen up.

22:28.919 --> 22:31.286
If Trask comes at you,
put your fingers straight out

22:31.288 --> 22:33.338
like this
and strike at his eyes.

22:33.340 --> 22:35.924
Poke him in the eyes?
That's your technique?

22:35.926 --> 22:38.143
No, that's your technique,
and if that doesn't work,

22:38.145 --> 22:40.262
you can always take your thumb,
jam it in his eye socket,

22:40.264 --> 22:41.463
and twist till
you hit his brain.

22:41.465 --> 22:43.148
Please, stop.

22:52.158 --> 22:53.809
Trask is still
in the courtyard,

22:53.811 --> 22:56.028
but I want eyes
on Lily at work.

22:56.030 --> 23:01.450
I'll be with her shortly.

23:01.452 --> 23:03.619
If she is Trask's
intended victim,

23:03.621 --> 23:06.988
I'd like a better view
of the inside of her apartment

23:06.990 --> 23:10.209
instead of simply
peering at her through a window.

23:15.231 --> 23:19.852
Mr. Reese,
there's already a camera here.

23:19.854 --> 23:22.271
Basic consumer model.
Wireless.

23:22.273 --> 23:25.357
Streaming to a hidden network.

23:25.359 --> 23:27.025
The receiver it's paired with

23:27.027 --> 23:28.393
could be anywhere
in the building.

23:28.395 --> 23:32.848
I think Trask has been
watching her every move.

23:34.450 --> 23:37.352
And I think Lily's
been spied on enough.

23:40.907 --> 23:44.243
Cell phone location data.

23:46.362 --> 23:48.380
- Oh!
- Hey, where you going?

23:48.382 --> 23:51.133
To get lost.

23:51.135 --> 23:54.253
Need to dust this for prints.

23:54.255 --> 23:56.922
- There you go.
- Yo! I think you broke it!

23:56.924 --> 23:59.224
So? Read a book.

24:34.744 --> 24:37.579
Sir? NYPD.
I need your jacket now.

24:37.581 --> 24:40.015
You're requisitioning
my jacket?

24:56.065 --> 24:57.316
Taxi!

25:00.370 --> 25:04.623
Queens,
corner of 45th and 21st.

25:20.757 --> 25:22.224
Hey,
you guys got a real problem.

25:22.226 --> 25:24.125
Carter's got info
from one of your cell phones.

25:24.127 --> 25:25.310
She's tracking you.

25:25.312 --> 25:26.728
I'm aware
that she's looking for me.

25:26.730 --> 25:28.230
I don't suppose you know why.

25:28.232 --> 25:31.316
No, not yet.
How's our guy?

25:31.318 --> 25:32.684
Alive. Hidden.

25:32.686 --> 25:34.603
Did you receive
the package I sent?

25:34.605 --> 25:37.656
Yeah, I got it right here.

25:40.410 --> 25:41.610
What, did you
run out of Adderall?

25:41.612 --> 25:43.912
Our friend's prints are on it.

25:43.914 --> 25:46.982
I need you to throw
the CIA off his trail.

25:46.984 --> 25:48.483
Take a road trip, detective.

25:48.485 --> 25:52.170
Connecticut's nice
this time of year.

25:56.509 --> 25:59.044
- Is everything good?
- It's great. Thank you.

25:59.046 --> 26:01.346
- You make sure you try...
- Good afternoon, Mr. Finch.

26:01.348 --> 26:02.848
How's it going with Lily?

26:02.850 --> 26:06.018
This may be the best-catered
stakeout in history.

26:06.020 --> 26:08.353
Don't eat in the field, Finch.

26:08.355 --> 26:10.355
Never know when
you'll have to move fast.

26:10.357 --> 26:13.225
Any progress
on the landlord's email?

26:13.227 --> 26:15.193
Still working on that one.

26:15.195 --> 26:17.012
What about the camera
I found at Lily's?

26:17.014 --> 26:19.197
If we can trace it to Trask,
we can get him fired,

26:19.199 --> 26:20.532
maybe even arrested.

26:20.534 --> 26:24.069
Still trying to break into
the hidden wireless network.

26:24.071 --> 26:26.822
No luck cracking
the password yet.

26:26.824 --> 26:28.790
But I did find out
some information

26:28.792 --> 26:30.242
about our friend Trask.

26:30.244 --> 26:32.661
Turns out there
used to be a Mrs. Trask.

26:32.663 --> 26:35.797
- Used to?
- She disappeared 13 years ago.

26:35.799 --> 26:37.666
Trask never called the cops.

26:37.668 --> 26:41.303
Told everyone she went to be
with family in Boca Raton.

26:41.305 --> 26:43.588
And I'm guessing
she's not in Boca.

26:43.590 --> 26:46.391
As far as I can tell...

26:46.393 --> 26:48.894
She's not anywhere.

26:48.896 --> 26:50.979
Maybe Lily's not his first.

26:53.851 --> 26:57.552
And I think it's safe to say
she knows she has a stalker.

26:57.554 --> 26:58.570
Hey, Aaron?

26:58.572 --> 27:00.022
Can you just
throw these away for me?

27:00.024 --> 27:02.007
Yeah, sure.

27:02.009 --> 27:04.242
Poor girl seems miserable.

27:04.244 --> 27:06.244
She just threw
a gift in the trash.

27:06.246 --> 27:08.330
Bouquet of roses.

27:15.922 --> 27:18.874
Taxi!

27:18.876 --> 27:21.259
So, this is where
Burdett's trail ends.

27:21.261 --> 27:25.297
Where'd you go from here?

27:40.530 --> 27:41.763
You're wasting
your time, detective.

27:41.765 --> 27:46.267
I falsified
the location data this morning.

27:46.269 --> 27:49.237
I'm gonna go out on a limb and
guess your name isn't Burdett.

27:49.239 --> 27:51.873
Do you think finding me
will lead you to my partner?

27:51.875 --> 27:53.575
Are you still trying
to make that arrest?

27:53.577 --> 27:57.162
Oh, no. His CIA pals
got that out of my system.

27:57.164 --> 27:59.247
I wanted to catch him,
not kill him.

27:59.249 --> 28:01.166
What do you want now?

28:01.168 --> 28:02.634
Still working that out.

28:02.636 --> 28:04.753
But if I'm going to keep
lying to government agents

28:04.755 --> 28:08.289
to protect you two, I'm gonna
need a damn good reason.

28:08.291 --> 28:10.175
I want answers.

28:10.177 --> 28:12.293
I need to know what you do.

28:12.295 --> 28:15.480
Turn around, detective.

28:33.032 --> 28:35.117
How's your friend?

28:39.873 --> 28:42.157
You're gonna
have to tell me something.

28:42.159 --> 28:43.992
Like who the hell are you,

28:43.994 --> 28:46.361
and what exactly
is going on here?

28:50.349 --> 28:52.300
When I was nine years old,
my brothers decided

28:52.302 --> 28:54.269
I needed to learn swim,
so they tossed me

28:54.271 --> 28:55.687
into the deep end of the pool.

28:55.689 --> 28:59.975
Took a few minutes,
but I figured it out.

29:06.566 --> 29:08.867
Do you see that man, detective?

29:11.037 --> 29:13.538
His name is Derek Watson,
39 years old.

29:13.540 --> 29:17.209
18 months ago, he lost his job.

29:17.211 --> 29:19.911
He tried to keep up with
the mortgage as best he could,

29:19.913 --> 29:22.080
but the money
ran out eventually.

29:22.082 --> 29:26.885
Lost his house,
and his wife left soon after.

29:26.887 --> 29:30.789
Derek Watson is about to be
involved in a violent crime.

29:32.508 --> 29:34.926
I don't know what exactly,
but believe me,

29:34.928 --> 29:37.262
something is gonna happen.

29:37.264 --> 29:40.582
You can't know that.

29:42.818 --> 29:44.753
Did you bring
your service weapon, detective?

29:44.755 --> 29:47.555
Sorry to toss you
into the deep end,

29:47.557 --> 29:50.692
but, as you know,
my friend is indisposed.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.274
NYPD homicide.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.558
It's Carter.

30:11.560 --> 30:14.811
I need a background on
a Derek Watson, 39 years old.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.914
I show a Derek H. Watson
in Mount Vernon.

30:17.916 --> 30:20.067
House was foreclosed
two months ago.

30:20.069 --> 30:21.501
No current address.

30:21.503 --> 30:22.953
That's him.
What do you got?

30:22.955 --> 30:25.672
Not much.
No priors, no arrests.

30:25.674 --> 30:27.708
A couple of unpaid
parking tickets,

30:27.710 --> 30:29.876
but that's about it.

30:29.878 --> 30:32.462
Hey, what's the name of
the bank that took his house?

30:32.464 --> 30:35.215
Truprime Mortgage.

30:40.588 --> 30:43.089
Who filed the paperwork
for the bank?

30:43.091 --> 30:46.276
John Dalton.
Is this for an open homicide?

30:46.278 --> 30:48.195
I'll have to
get back to you on that.

30:57.238 --> 30:59.456
Finest surveillance training
on the planet,

30:59.458 --> 31:01.792
and a New York cop
gave you the slip.

31:04.278 --> 31:06.646
Well, I know
she's not in here, guys.

31:10.918 --> 31:12.669
Reese hasn't turned up dead,
so odds are

31:12.671 --> 31:15.422
- he's found a safe house.
- Expand the search.

31:15.424 --> 31:18.475
All apartments and hotels
rented in the last two days.

31:18.477 --> 31:22.162
- But if he's anywhere--
- Just... Make it happen.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.732
You have eyes on Trask,
Mr. Reese?

31:25.734 --> 31:27.934
Where the hell have you been?

31:27.936 --> 31:29.803
Now you know how I feel.

31:29.805 --> 31:32.439
Lily's headed home.
Is it safe for her there?

31:32.441 --> 31:34.741
I'm watching Trask right now.

31:34.743 --> 31:36.976
And I'm not sure
she's his target.

31:36.978 --> 31:39.613
I think Trask
might be after Rick.

31:39.615 --> 31:41.365
- Why?
- Well, he spent the afternoon

31:41.367 --> 31:43.033
sniffing around
Rick's apartment.

31:43.035 --> 31:46.286
If I didn't know better, I'd say
now he's digging a grave.

31:47.289 --> 31:48.655
Trask gets rid of the boyfriend

31:48.657 --> 31:50.540
and has Lily all to himself.

31:53.461 --> 31:54.594
Everything allight?

31:54.596 --> 31:56.546
Yeah, I'm just sick
of being cooped up

31:56.548 --> 32:01.051
and, uh, staring
at screens all day.

32:01.053 --> 32:03.019
I'd rather be doing that
than trudging around

32:03.021 --> 32:04.354
half of Manhattan.

32:04.356 --> 32:07.040
I have half a mind
to spot Lily cab fare.

32:07.042 --> 32:09.676
Finch,
how fast can you get here?

32:09.678 --> 32:11.278
About 15 minutes.
Why?

32:11.280 --> 32:13.397
Because we just
ran out of time.

32:13.399 --> 32:16.900
I think Trask
is making his move tonight.

32:18.369 --> 32:19.903
Checking your mail,
huh, Mr. Morris?

32:19.905 --> 32:21.288
- Looks like it.
- Yeah, I think I, uh,

32:21.290 --> 32:24.040
I think I figured out
why your place is flooding.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.742
It just, uh, it just
needs a special faucet.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.577
Why don't we, uh, why don't we
go downstairs and check it out?

32:27.579 --> 32:30.380
If, uh, if you like it,
I can install it tomorrow.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.665
No more floods.
So why don't we go

32:31.667 --> 32:33.884
- down to the basement?
- I-I'm busy, all right?

32:33.886 --> 32:37.304
I don't need to see anything,
just have it fixed.

32:40.391 --> 32:42.008
You need to stay away
from Lily.

32:42.010 --> 32:43.376
What?

32:43.378 --> 32:46.213
Have you lost your mind?

32:46.215 --> 32:48.932
I've called the car.
I can be there in five.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.684
That'll be
four minutes too late.

32:50.686 --> 32:52.903
She doesn't love you, man.
All right?

32:52.905 --> 32:54.604
You need to leave her alone.

33:02.563 --> 33:05.398
You got some kind of pathetic
old-man crush here, Trask?

33:05.400 --> 33:08.001
Gonna punch me out,
take Lily to the dance?

33:08.003 --> 33:11.755
You're not her boyfriend,
and you're not her hero.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.540
You're just the damn janitor.

33:13.542 --> 33:15.592
So if my toilet clogs,
I'll let you know.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.427
Otherwise, step aside.

33:23.751 --> 33:25.084
Is the building on fire?

33:25.086 --> 33:26.553
I'm sure
everything's fine, Mrs. F,

33:26.555 --> 33:30.474
but I'm gonna go check it out
just the same, all right?

33:34.529 --> 33:36.196
I come home
and things have moved,

33:36.198 --> 33:38.365
like he's been
inside my apartment.

33:38.367 --> 33:41.401
I'm scared of
what he's going to do.

33:42.954 --> 33:46.105
Finch, this isn't over.
Trask will try again.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.874
And he's still
obsessed with Lily.

33:47.876 --> 33:50.994
Perhaps we should consider
more aggressive tactics.

34:09.063 --> 34:11.297
He's terrorizing her.

34:13.684 --> 34:16.302
I want Trask
out of the building tonight.

34:24.110 --> 34:26.996
- Mr. Hayes.
- My name isn't Hayes.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.915
Well, then I'm gonna
ask you to leave.

34:28.917 --> 34:31.150
Actually...

34:31.152 --> 34:35.054
You're the one
who'll be leaving.

34:37.157 --> 34:39.543
Hey, I don't know
what you think--

34:39.545 --> 34:42.379
I know about the roses,
and the texts,

34:42.380 --> 34:44.764
- and the hidden camera.
- No, I would never--

34:44.766 --> 34:46.882
I know about the gun, Trask,
and I know you were ready

34:46.885 --> 34:50.353
to kill her boyfriend tonight.

34:50.355 --> 34:53.505
He's not her boyfriend.

34:53.507 --> 34:54.858
You don't understand.

34:54.860 --> 34:59.312
Now, you're gonna pack
your bag and leave this place.

35:00.449 --> 35:02.732
And no matter how much
you think you love her,

35:02.734 --> 35:04.284
you're never coming back.

35:04.286 --> 35:08.622
Please...

35:08.624 --> 35:12.375
I love this job.

35:12.377 --> 35:14.744
And I do care for Lily,
but not like that.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.329
Not like that.

35:30.595 --> 35:32.746
Finch, Trask didn't take
those photos of Lily.

35:32.748 --> 35:34.314
He stole them
from the penthouse.

35:34.316 --> 35:35.565
I know.

35:35.567 --> 35:38.184
He didn't plant
the cameras either.

35:38.186 --> 35:40.220
Trask isn't the stalker.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.775
Didn't you like
the flowers, babe?

35:47.394 --> 35:48.995
How did you get in here?

35:48.997 --> 35:50.830
I thought it could
just be you and me tonight.

35:50.832 --> 35:53.500
Please, go.
I want you to go.

35:53.502 --> 35:54.701
Come on, baby.

35:54.703 --> 35:56.953
You know
you don't want me to leave.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.756
Mr. Reese,
we're gonna need a little help.

36:07.430 --> 36:09.481
Get out of my apartment now.

36:09.483 --> 36:11.633
You don't mean that.

36:11.635 --> 36:15.187
Rick, please.
This has to stop.

36:15.189 --> 36:16.404
The phone calls,
the flowers--

36:16.406 --> 36:17.522
Oh, come on.
Those were just a little

36:17.524 --> 36:19.140
"thank you"
for our date last night.

36:19.142 --> 36:21.860
That wasn't a date.
We were going to the same party.

36:21.862 --> 36:24.196
You're such a tease.

36:24.198 --> 36:25.530
You made me
share a cab with you

36:25.532 --> 36:27.649
and then you
followed me all night.

36:27.651 --> 36:28.950
I'm just trying
to help you, sweetie.

36:28.952 --> 36:30.985
Come on, I could do so much
for you in this town.

36:30.987 --> 36:32.337
Make you executive chef.

36:32.339 --> 36:34.873
I don't want to work for you,
I just want you to leave.

36:34.875 --> 36:37.259
The super told me
to stay away from you.

36:37.261 --> 36:39.827
Did you----
tell him about us?

36:39.829 --> 36:42.547
Did you lie
and say you don't love me?

36:42.549 --> 36:43.965
No.

36:43.967 --> 36:46.551
Now, why would you want
to hurt me like that, baby?

36:46.553 --> 36:47.669
Would you like it
if I hurt you?

36:47.671 --> 36:49.521
No--

36:49.523 --> 36:52.724
All I've ever done
is look out for you, Lily.

36:52.726 --> 36:55.677
It's time you showed
a little gratitude.

36:55.679 --> 36:58.647
Let her go, Mr. Morris!

36:58.649 --> 37:00.866
Oh!

37:03.686 --> 37:05.070
Agh!

37:05.072 --> 37:08.039
I believe I told you
to leave her alone.

37:08.041 --> 37:09.407
Ah!

37:46.780 --> 37:48.113
We got something.

37:48.115 --> 37:50.532
Break-in at a veterinary clinic
in northern Connecticut.

37:50.534 --> 37:52.250
Reese's prints
were on a prescription bottle

37:52.252 --> 37:54.035
found at the scene.

37:54.037 --> 37:55.870
Couldn't be telling me
this while we drive?

38:02.795 --> 38:03.878
"Anonymous tip" my ass.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.931
This has gotta be
some kind of joke.

38:05.933 --> 38:08.683
All right, let's go.
Hands behind your back.

38:08.685 --> 38:10.135
BP 90 over 50.

38:10.137 --> 38:11.970
Thready pulse, multiple
fractures, bleeding internally.

38:11.972 --> 38:15.056
I told him that
I wasn't interested, and...

38:15.058 --> 38:18.043
And it was like
something in him snapped.

38:18.045 --> 38:23.064
He became obsessive
and, um, very unstable.

38:23.066 --> 38:26.618
He's been stalking me
for months, but I was too afraid

38:26.620 --> 38:28.787
to tell anyone.

38:28.789 --> 38:30.455
And if Ernie hadn't
shown up when he did--

38:30.457 --> 38:32.874
That wasn't nothing.

38:32.876 --> 38:33.959
Should've seen some of the guys

38:33.961 --> 38:35.710
they sent after me
back in Miami.

38:35.712 --> 38:38.496
You do not want to mess around
with the Cuban mafia.

38:38.498 --> 38:40.548
- Ow-- Easy.
- Sorry, sir.

38:40.550 --> 38:42.834
Here.

38:42.836 --> 38:45.286
- What's this?
- Trask's gun.

38:45.288 --> 38:48.723
Oh. Good.

38:48.725 --> 38:50.592
You know,
his name isn't Ernest Trask,

38:50.594 --> 38:53.961
it's Ernesto Machado.

38:53.963 --> 38:56.514
He used to own
six nightclubs in Miami,

38:56.516 --> 39:01.770
a yacht,
house in Coral Gables, and...

39:03.489 --> 39:07.492
A pet tiger.

39:07.494 --> 39:08.660
It was all true.

39:08.662 --> 39:11.863
Even the part about it
being bad for his health.

39:11.865 --> 39:15.483
He testified against
the Cuban mafia in 1996.

39:15.485 --> 39:16.918
Still a price on his head.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.837
He's in Witness Protection.

39:18.839 --> 39:21.873
That's why
you couldn't find Mrs. Trask.

39:21.875 --> 39:23.508
She came with him from Miami,

39:23.510 --> 39:28.680
but without the houses and
the clubs she didn't last long.

39:28.682 --> 39:31.132
She left him,
moved in with relatives--

39:31.134 --> 39:32.684
In Boca Raton.

39:32.686 --> 39:34.936
How'd you find all that out?

39:34.938 --> 39:36.688
I'm good with computers.

39:36.690 --> 39:38.523
Be honest, Finch.

39:38.525 --> 39:41.192
There is no machine, is there?

39:41.194 --> 39:42.644
It's just you.

39:42.646 --> 39:45.563
I'll be ready
when the next number comes.

39:45.565 --> 39:48.616
Funny you should mention that.

40:16.512 --> 40:18.430
Gun!

40:19.399 --> 40:21.883
Drop it!
Drop it!

40:21.885 --> 40:25.153
It's all right. NYPD.
Everything's under control.

40:31.945 --> 40:34.162
Get down.

40:37.283 --> 40:41.836
That, Detective Carter,
is what we do.

40:58.053 --> 41:02.123
Well done, my friend.

41:03.592 --> 41:07.145
Now, tell me...

41:07.147 --> 41:09.430
What on Earth was it
that made the machine

41:09.432 --> 41:11.483
pick out Kurzweil's number?

41:11.485 --> 41:13.485
You want me to pop the hood?

41:13.487 --> 41:14.903
Yeah.

41:23.078 --> 41:25.296
November 2002.

41:25.298 --> 41:27.448
This isn't
the first item chronologically,

41:27.450 --> 41:29.918
but it's the one
that triggered a harder look.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.119
- A gas station receipt?
- 18 of them...

41:32.121 --> 41:35.473
From a Shell station
just outside Towson, Maryland.

41:35.475 --> 41:38.292
Kurzweil stopped there
every third Thursday

41:38.294 --> 41:41.429
of every even month, even if
he'd filled up the day before.

41:41.431 --> 41:43.648
On 3 of his 18 visits,

41:43.650 --> 41:47.101
this SUV was present
two hours before.

41:47.103 --> 41:48.236
A dead drop.

41:48.238 --> 41:50.355
The SUV
was registered to the wife

41:50.357 --> 41:53.474
of a turkish oil executive
that paid for plane tickets

41:53.476 --> 41:56.327
used by an iranian suspect
in the bombing

41:56.329 --> 42:00.281
of a Jewish community center
in Buenos Aires in 1994.

42:00.283 --> 42:05.119
The thinnest thread connects
Kurzweil and his contact

42:05.121 --> 42:06.621
and the machine could see it.

42:06.623 --> 42:10.792
It knew, and it was right.

42:10.794 --> 42:13.828
It does this all the time...

42:13.830 --> 42:16.681
To all of us?

42:16.683 --> 42:18.883
That's...Terrifying.

42:18.885 --> 42:20.235
It's probably a good thing that

42:20.237 --> 42:21.936
you're the only other person
that will ever see

42:21.938 --> 42:23.938
how this machine works.

42:23.940 --> 42:27.308
When it's complete, I'll encrypt
the OS so completely

42:27.310 --> 42:30.028
that no computer on earth
will ever crack it.

42:30.030 --> 42:33.198
Does it bother you?
I mean...

42:33.200 --> 42:37.368
What you've achieved
is historic.

42:37.370 --> 42:39.904
But no one will ever know.

42:39.906 --> 42:41.689
It's the way it has to be
to be sure.

42:41.691 --> 42:43.190
Sure of what?

42:43.192 --> 42:45.526
Sure that they'll use it
the way I intended.

42:45.528 --> 42:47.712
So you think the government
would abuse this machine?

42:51.550 --> 42:53.501
Denton Weeks has spent
the last six months trying

42:53.503 --> 42:57.005
to tunnel into the machine
by way of the NSA feeds.

42:57.007 --> 43:00.308
He's failed,
but he'll keep trying.

43:00.310 --> 43:01.926
And he won't be alone.

43:01.928 --> 43:03.711
I don't even want to think
about what a man like Weeks

43:03.713 --> 43:05.763
would do with
that kind of power.

43:05.765 --> 43:07.181
That's why we have to
keep him or anyone else

43:07.183 --> 43:10.068
from ever getting
their hands on it.

43:10.070 --> 43:14.072
You sure it was Weeks?

43:14.074 --> 43:16.357
The machine told me.

43:16.359 --> 43:18.893
It has an instinct
for self-preservation.

43:18.895 --> 43:21.162
You talk about
that thing like it's alive.

43:21.164 --> 43:23.581
Shh.
It can hear you.
