Well, we're movin'
on up  Movin' on up

00:04.280 --> 00:07.421
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.421 --> 00:11.666
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.666 --> 00:14.738
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.738 --> 00:17.672
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.672 --> 00:23.126
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.126 --> 00:25.818
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:25.818 --> 00:28.821
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.821 --> 00:31.307
Took a whole
lot of tryin'

00:31.307 --> 00:33.895
Just to get
up that hill

00:33.895 --> 00:36.450
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.450 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our
turn at bat

00:39.108 --> 00:41.489
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.489 --> 00:43.388
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.388 --> 00:46.287
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.287 --> 00:49.256
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.256 --> 00:53.605
To a deluxe apartment

00:53.605 --> 00:57.091
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:57.091 --> 00:59.542
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.542 --> 01:05.203
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:32.816 --> 01:34.024
GEORGE: Hey!

01:36.337 --> 01:37.718
What the hell
you doing, Weezy?

01:37.718 --> 01:40.100
What are you doing?
I'm trying
to hang a painting.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.515
In the closet?

01:41.515 --> 01:44.207
No, not in the closet,
only a dummy would do that.

01:44.207 --> 01:46.071
That's why I asked.

01:48.211 --> 01:49.661
I'm putting it over
the writing desk.

01:53.389 --> 01:55.563
Why are you hanging
a picture of a horse?

01:55.563 --> 01:58.842
That is not just a horse,
Weezy, that's a race horse.

01:58.842 --> 02:02.363
It reminds me of the horse
you bet on last week.
It does?

02:02.363 --> 02:05.159
Yeah. That one wasn't
moving either.

02:06.954 --> 02:09.681
Don't worry about it,
Weezy, it'll be
down by tomorrow.

02:09.681 --> 02:12.201
I just want to leave it
there so Mr. Hendricks
will see it tonight.

02:12.201 --> 02:13.961
Who's Mr. Hendricks?

02:13.961 --> 02:15.790
Mr. Hendricks is a big
real estate man.

02:15.790 --> 02:17.654
He's got some
property I'm going to lease.

02:17.654 --> 02:19.277
What's that got to do
with the picture?

02:19.277 --> 02:23.039
Hendricks owns race
horses. And I want to impress
him.

02:23.039 --> 02:25.317
Why don't you show
him your jockey shorts?

02:26.353 --> 02:27.975
Weezy...

02:27.975 --> 02:30.978
Look, George, I'm going
to be working on the
newsletter tonight.

02:30.978 --> 02:34.015
Can't you call this
Mr. Hendricks and make your
meeting for another night?

02:34.015 --> 02:37.605
Another night, are you
kidding? I'm lucky I got
him to stop by tonight!

02:37.605 --> 02:39.366
Oh, but, George...

02:39.366 --> 02:42.817
Look, Weezy. I've been
trying for six months to get
this guy to come over here.

02:42.817 --> 02:45.889
Now look, he is so busy
his answering service
as got an answering service.

02:47.443 --> 02:49.376
Then how did you
get him to come over?

02:49.376 --> 02:51.240
Well, I just called his
secretary and told her

02:51.240 --> 02:53.759
to remind him that
he has an appointment
with me tonight.

02:53.759 --> 02:56.003
But he doesn't
have an appointment
with you.

02:56.003 --> 03:00.180
I know, but a guy that
busy doesn't remember
whether he does or doesn't.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.700
So when his secretary
reminds him then he'll
make sure that he does.

03:06.013 --> 03:08.188
What have you got there?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.775
Racing magazines.

03:09.775 --> 03:11.674
To impress
Mr. Hendricks?

03:11.674 --> 03:14.263
Right. Look at all
the dust on this table.

03:14.263 --> 03:16.057
Florence!
FLORENCE: Yes?

03:16.057 --> 03:17.887
I wanna see you
right now!

03:17.887 --> 03:19.509
FLORENCE: Okay. Look
in the kitchen.

03:24.169 --> 03:26.275
Stay away from the kitchen
door, Weezy.

03:26.275 --> 03:27.655
Why?
I don't want you
to get hit

03:27.655 --> 03:29.312
when Florence comes
flying out of there.

03:31.038 --> 03:32.971
Florence!
That's my name.

03:34.075 --> 03:35.594
The living room
needs dusting!

03:35.594 --> 03:37.355
Okay, the dust rag's
in the broom closet.

03:38.459 --> 03:40.047
I want you to do
the dusting.

03:40.047 --> 03:41.842
I just dusted yesterday.

03:41.842 --> 03:45.259
Mr. Hendricks ain't coming
yesterday, he's coming today.
Now get the moving.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.434
Okay, as soon
as I finish this.

03:47.434 --> 03:50.022
What are you doing?
I'm giving my
hands a test.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.990
For what, to see which
one does the less work?

03:54.164 --> 03:57.340
No, it's the velvet hand
test. I've got Liquid
Velvet in this pan,

03:57.340 --> 03:59.377
and my regular dishwashing
soap in this pan.

03:59.377 --> 04:00.999
So?

04:00.999 --> 04:04.485
Well, on TV they say that
Liquid Velvet makes
your hands real soft.

04:07.074 --> 04:08.903
I don't think
it's working.

04:08.903 --> 04:12.666
I guess not! How can it
get your hands soft
and leave the dishes hard?

04:14.771 --> 04:17.464
Now look, just get on with
the dusting. Mr. Hendricks
will be here soon,

04:17.464 --> 04:20.536
and I want everything
in this apartment
to look good.

04:20.536 --> 04:22.365
In that case,
you'd better leave.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.509
Weezy, what is
all this junk?

04:28.509 --> 04:31.926
George, I told you,
I've got to work on this
newsletter tonight.

04:31.926 --> 04:34.964
I've got to have it
ready for the printer
by tomorrow morning.

04:34.964 --> 04:36.897
But I gotta talk
to Mr. Hendricks!

04:36.897 --> 04:40.797
Oh, I don't mind.
Just keep it down so
it won't disturb me.

04:40.797 --> 04:42.074
Oh, Weezy!

04:42.074 --> 04:44.111
Oh, Mr. Hendricks,
come on in!

04:44.111 --> 04:45.802
Thanks, Jefferson.

04:45.802 --> 04:50.048
Hey, your coat.
Yeah, glad you could
make it here!

04:50.048 --> 04:54.501
Now, come on, let me
show you around
the apartment. Well...

04:54.501 --> 04:56.330
What do you think,
Mr. Hendricks?

04:57.504 --> 04:59.333
Call Me Charlie.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.059
Charlie? I thought
your name was Kurt.

05:01.059 --> 05:03.268
It is. I'm talking
about the horse.

05:03.268 --> 05:04.994
His name is
Call Me Charlie.

05:04.994 --> 05:06.202
Oh, yeah, right!

05:07.237 --> 05:08.653
You follow the horses?

05:08.653 --> 05:10.620
Oh, sure, but I try not to
follow them too close

05:10.620 --> 05:11.966
'cause I don't like
to get my shoes dirty.

05:14.279 --> 05:16.143
I hate that horse.

05:16.143 --> 05:19.215
I lost a lot of money
betting against him
at Aqueduct last year.

05:19.215 --> 05:21.873
Oh, yeah?
I hate him too.

05:21.873 --> 05:25.877
Hey, Weezy? How many
times have I told you
to get rid of this picture?

05:25.877 --> 05:29.018
George, you just brought...
Put something nice up there!

05:29.018 --> 05:30.709
Like an ocean
or something!

05:32.332 --> 05:36.370
Mr. Hendricks,
this is my wife Louise.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.854
How do you do?
How do you do?

05:37.854 --> 05:40.374
Louise is the editor of
the Help Center newsletter.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.618
Isn't that nice?
It's very nice.

05:42.618 --> 05:44.758
Now, remind me, Jefferson,
what was it I wanted

05:44.758 --> 05:46.725
to talk to you about?
I don't have much time.

05:46.725 --> 05:48.658
Oh, yeah, well, see,
this property you have...
Miss Jefferson?

05:48.658 --> 05:51.005
Yes, Florence?
Which one do you
think is softer?

05:51.005 --> 05:52.144
This one.

05:54.526 --> 05:56.701
It may be soft,
but at least it
ain't hollow.

06:02.431 --> 06:04.778
You have to excuse my maid.
Every time she opens her mouth

06:04.778 --> 06:07.263
her brain takes
a coffee break.

06:07.263 --> 06:10.128
Of course, you don't have
that problem, 'cause you
ain't got no brain.

06:15.961 --> 06:17.342
Now what did you
say needed dusting?

06:17.342 --> 06:20.138
Never mind the dusting,
we could use a couple drinks.

06:20.138 --> 06:21.933
Scotch?
Fine.

06:21.933 --> 06:24.176
That's very good,
Mr. Jefferson. You keep
changing your mind like that,

06:24.176 --> 06:27.283
and some day, maybe you'll
end up with one that works.

06:27.283 --> 06:30.044
And some day maybe
I'll end up with a maid
that works.

06:30.044 --> 06:32.875
I doubt it, 'cause
it ain't easy
working in all this heat.

06:32.875 --> 06:35.567
What heat?
All that hot air
coming out your mouth.

06:45.059 --> 06:48.235
Now, Mr. Hendricks, about
that property I wanted to...

06:48.235 --> 06:52.101
You know, Jefferson, that
maid of yours is a real wit!

06:52.101 --> 06:54.759
A nitwit!

06:54.759 --> 06:57.589
You're lucky she didn't
hear you say that, she'd
have clobbered you.

06:57.589 --> 06:59.211
She's really funny!

06:59.211 --> 07:01.041
Now look, I'm willing
to offer you...

07:01.041 --> 07:04.251
You know, I haven't
laughed like that
in a long time.

07:04.251 --> 07:05.908
I could listen
to her all night.

07:05.908 --> 07:07.357
Mr. Hendricks,
the property.

07:07.357 --> 07:09.256
Oh, that. Well now,
Jefferson, you know there are

07:09.256 --> 07:11.085
a lot of people interested
in that property.

07:11.085 --> 07:13.087
Yeah, I know, that's
why I want to hurry up
and get it before...

07:13.087 --> 07:14.261
What's that?

07:14.261 --> 07:17.264
That's my beeper.

07:17.264 --> 07:21.406
Listen, do you mind
if I use your phone to call
my answering service?

07:21.406 --> 07:22.718
No, no, go ahead,
help yourself.
Thank you.

07:26.998 --> 07:29.379
Florence...
Don't get mad at me,
'cause you started it.

07:29.379 --> 07:31.727
I know it!
I want you to
keep putting me down.

07:31.727 --> 07:34.246
Huh?
Look, I can't get nowhere
with this Mr. Hendricks.

07:34.246 --> 07:38.216
But I want to keep him here.
All he seems to like is the
way you keep mouthing at me.

07:38.216 --> 07:41.495
Huh?
Look, stop huh-ing
and listen!

07:41.495 --> 07:45.223
Now when he gets off the
phone, serve us our drinks and
then keep insulting me, okay?

07:45.223 --> 07:47.432
Wait a minute.
Am I hearing this right?

07:47.432 --> 07:48.985
You want me
to insult you?

07:48.985 --> 07:51.401
Yeah! I'll give you
20 bucks if you
do a good job.

07:51.401 --> 07:53.300
20 bucks?
Right.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.510
Look, Mr. Jefferson,
keep your 20 bucks.
This one's on me.

08:01.619 --> 08:04.207
Here you are.
Oh, thank you.

08:04.207 --> 08:06.589
Florence, now you know
I like my scotch
on the rocks.

08:06.589 --> 08:07.728
Then why don't
you pour it
over your head?

08:14.977 --> 08:16.737
Ain't she got a
big sense of humor?

08:18.221 --> 08:20.361
Anything is big to you.

08:20.361 --> 08:23.123
He's so short he had
to stand on his toes
to put his hat on.

08:28.162 --> 08:29.750
Florence, I don't
even wear a hat.

08:29.750 --> 08:32.063
That's 'cause you can't
find one big enough
to fit your fat head.

08:37.068 --> 08:41.244
And ugly! Child, Mr.
Jefferson is so ugly that when
he used to work in a bakery,

08:41.244 --> 08:43.971
they used to dip his face
in the batter to make
the animal cookies.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.565
That's a good one!

08:54.982 --> 08:58.883
I could listen
to her all night.
Yeah.

08:58.883 --> 09:00.505
But I got to be going.
Going?

09:00.505 --> 09:03.612
Yeah, I just got an urgent
call from a business
associate,

09:03.612 --> 09:06.200
says he wants to see me
right away, must be important.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.271
I'm going to meet him
down at the
Railroad Station.

09:08.271 --> 09:09.894
Railroad station,
what's he scared of flying?

09:09.894 --> 09:13.069
Oh, no. The Railroad
Station's a private disco club.

09:13.069 --> 09:15.624
But what about our...
You belong to
the Railroad Station?

09:15.624 --> 09:17.039
I sure do.

09:17.039 --> 09:19.075
Whoo! That's one of
the fanciest discos
in town.

09:19.075 --> 09:20.836
Oh, it's not that much.

09:20.836 --> 09:23.563
Well, maybe it ain't to
you, but it's a lot better than
where I go dancing.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.565
Anything's better
than the USO.

09:29.465 --> 09:33.089
Well, how about it, Florence,
would you like to go with me?

09:33.089 --> 09:34.297
Me?

09:34.297 --> 09:36.161
Well, I'd love to,
but I...
But she can't.

09:36.161 --> 09:37.749
Why not?
Because Mr. Hendricks

09:37.749 --> 09:39.993
doesn't have insurance
for you stepping
all over his feet.

09:41.650 --> 09:43.272
That ain't funny,
Jefferson.

09:46.516 --> 09:50.382
Now, how about it,
Florence, would you
care to join me?

09:50.382 --> 09:51.521
Well, I hardly
know you.

09:51.521 --> 09:53.489
I have to think
about it.

09:53.489 --> 09:54.594
Okay, I thought
about it.

09:56.423 --> 09:58.287
I'll go change.
Oh, good, look...

09:58.287 --> 10:00.323
We'll hit the
Railroad Station,

10:00.323 --> 10:04.465
and get our engines
moving on...

10:04.465 --> 10:07.745
Oh, just one thing. Be
sure you keep your hands
off my caboose.

10:12.473 --> 10:14.130
Now, Mr. Hendricks,
what about our business talk?

10:14.130 --> 10:16.995
Well, we can talk about
it at the Railroad Station,
George.

10:16.995 --> 10:18.997
I'm sure you
and your wife
would love it.

10:18.997 --> 10:20.654
Oh, yeah, I bet
you we would!

10:20.654 --> 10:22.207
Hey, Weezy, come on,
hurry up and get changed!

10:22.207 --> 10:25.728
Oh, thanks for the invitation,
Mr. Hendricks, but I can't go.

10:25.728 --> 10:28.386
I have to finish
this newsletter tonight.

10:28.386 --> 10:29.870
Weezy!
That's all right, Jefferson,

10:29.870 --> 10:32.390
if your wife has something
to do, she should do it.

10:32.390 --> 10:35.427
Yeah, I guess you right.
Well I guess just the three
of us have to go, then.

10:35.427 --> 10:36.946
No, I don't think
we can do that.

10:36.946 --> 10:39.500
Why not?
Well, the club's restricted.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.848
Restricted?
How are you going
to get in?

10:41.848 --> 10:43.470
Not restricted
like that.

10:43.470 --> 10:45.506
No, you see, it's
a couples only club.

10:45.506 --> 10:47.612
No single guests
allowed.
Oh...

10:47.612 --> 10:51.064
Uh, Jefferson, do you mind
if I use your bathroom
to freshen up?

10:51.064 --> 10:53.411
Wait a minute, we were
going to talk about the
property I want to lease.

10:53.411 --> 10:55.585
Oh, well, we can talk
about it when Florence
and I get back.

10:55.585 --> 10:58.071
See, I got to catch
a plane to Las Vegas
in the morning,

10:58.071 --> 10:59.866
so we won't be
out too late.

10:59.866 --> 11:02.247
Okay.
Oh, and, Jefferson,

11:02.247 --> 11:06.010
you know, after a night's
dancing with Florence,

11:06.010 --> 11:10.324
I got a feeling I won't be
able to say no to
any offer you make me, huh?

11:14.328 --> 11:15.536
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

11:19.092 --> 11:20.783
You know, George,

11:20.783 --> 11:24.269
you're lucky Mr. Hendricks
only likes horses.

11:24.269 --> 11:25.719
Why you say that?

11:25.719 --> 11:30.310
Because if he liked
jackasses, he'd be
taking you to the disco.

11:30.310 --> 11:32.692
I don't care what you say,
Weezy. I got Mr. Hendricks

11:32.692 --> 11:33.762
eating out of the
palm of my hand.

11:35.902 --> 11:39.043
That's enough to give
him indigestion
for life.

11:39.043 --> 11:41.873
Okay, Florence,
you can stop making
up the insults now.

11:41.873 --> 11:43.012
Who's making them up?

11:43.012 --> 11:44.117
Ah, come on!

11:44.117 --> 11:45.670
LOUISE: Stop that!

11:45.670 --> 11:49.018
That's right, Mr.
Jefferson. Remember, I'm the
golden goose.

11:49.018 --> 11:50.710
Well, Florence,
are you ready to go?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.988
Yes.
Goodbye, y'all.

11:52.988 --> 11:56.198
See y'all later.
Try to have a nice
time without me.

11:56.198 --> 11:57.578
Without you
is the only way.

12:16.528 --> 12:20.429
Let's see, it's "I" before
"E" except after...

12:21.637 --> 12:23.639
That just doesn't
look right.

12:23.639 --> 12:26.435
George, how do
you spell "receipt?"

12:26.435 --> 12:30.508
Uh, receipt.
R-E, uh...

12:31.889 --> 12:33.097
P-A-I-D.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.550
I'll look it up.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.760
While you're at it, see
if you can find out
how to spell "Tahiti."

12:40.760 --> 12:42.658
'Cause that's where
we're going to go
celebrate when I open

12:42.658 --> 12:44.487
my new store
on Hendricks' property.

12:45.972 --> 12:47.767
Florence, at last!

12:47.767 --> 12:50.321
Hey, Florence,
wait a minute!
What?

12:50.321 --> 12:51.840
Where's Mr. Hendricks?
Who cares?

12:51.840 --> 12:53.773
I do!
What happened?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.602
Well, it was right
after we finished skating.

12:55.602 --> 12:56.741
You went skating?

12:56.741 --> 12:58.916
No, the Skate's a new
dance he taught me.

12:58.916 --> 13:02.609
You put one foot like
this, and the other foot like
this.

13:02.609 --> 13:04.162
Sh-doo, sh-doo...

13:04.162 --> 13:06.406
Florence, stop the bull.

13:06.406 --> 13:09.547
That ain't the Bull,
the Bull goes like this.

13:09.547 --> 13:10.548
First you...

13:10.548 --> 13:13.240
Cut it out, tell me
what happened.

13:13.240 --> 13:18.245
Well, like I said, we was
having a real nice time when
all of a sudden, he, he...

13:18.245 --> 13:19.522
He got fresh?

13:19.522 --> 13:20.592
Worse!

13:20.592 --> 13:21.662
You got fresh?

13:23.664 --> 13:27.358
No. He asked me to go
to Las Vegas with him
tomorrow.

13:27.358 --> 13:28.497
And what'd you say?

13:28.497 --> 13:30.361
I didn't say nothing,
I used body language.

13:31.258 --> 13:32.294
Body language?

13:32.294 --> 13:34.675
Yeah, I hit him.
You what!

13:34.675 --> 13:36.746
What did Mr. Hendricks
say when you hit him?

13:36.746 --> 13:39.094
"Ouch."
Oh...

13:39.094 --> 13:42.476
I mean, who does he
think I am, the happy hooker?

13:42.476 --> 13:43.857
Look, if I don't get in
touch with Mr. Hendricks,

13:43.857 --> 13:45.755
you're going to be
the homeless housekeeper.

13:47.309 --> 13:48.793
What are you doing?

13:48.793 --> 13:50.450
I'm going to call the
Railroad Station and talk
to Hendricks

13:50.450 --> 13:52.762
and tell him that Florence
is sorry for the way
she acted,

13:52.762 --> 13:54.385
and that she'll go to
Las Vegas with him.

13:54.385 --> 13:56.801
Oh, no, you are not!

13:56.801 --> 13:59.045
But, Weezy, my whole
deal depends on it!

13:59.045 --> 14:01.875
Then forget it. Because
I wouldn't go across
the street with that turkey.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.222
Turkey? I though you said
you were having a good
time with him!

14:04.222 --> 14:05.845
I was while
we were dancing.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.537
But what he had on his
mind you don't do
on your feet.

14:08.537 --> 14:10.228
Oh.

14:10.228 --> 14:12.161
Come on, woman, ain't you
never spent the night
with somebody before?

14:12.161 --> 14:13.576
George!

14:13.576 --> 14:16.510
Number one, that ain't
none of your business.

14:16.510 --> 14:19.651
And number two,
no, he's a perfect stranger.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.930
Stranger? Hendricks
ain't no stranger!
I know him!

14:21.930 --> 14:23.759
Then you spend
the night with him!

14:29.351 --> 14:33.596
Don't give him any ideas,
Florence. You know how much
George wants that property.

14:35.115 --> 14:38.049
Weezy, I ain't
that kind of man.

14:38.049 --> 14:39.775
Now look, Florence.
I'll make a deal
with you.

14:39.775 --> 14:43.537
You go to Las Vegas with
Mr. Hendricks, and I'll give you
two weeks extra salary.

14:43.537 --> 14:46.195
Mr. Jefferson,
I ain't that kind
of woman.

14:46.195 --> 14:47.403
What kind of woman?

14:47.403 --> 14:49.164
You know what she means.

14:49.164 --> 14:52.684
There's a name for a woman
who takes money for
spending time with a man.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.479
Yeah. A rich woman.

14:56.861 --> 14:59.657
And besides, people don't
care what you do out
in Las Vegas.

14:59.657 --> 15:01.314
Anything goes
out there.

15:01.314 --> 15:02.522
Your maid don't.

15:04.351 --> 15:06.077
You tell him,
Florence!

15:06.077 --> 15:08.666
Look, Weezy. I'm not
trying to get Florence to do
anything wrong.

15:08.666 --> 15:10.806
I'm just trying to get
her to keep up
with the times.

15:10.806 --> 15:12.981
Oh, that's really
considerate of you.

15:12.981 --> 15:15.984
Of course it is, 'cause
I'm a considerate person.

15:15.984 --> 15:19.988
Now look, Florence. All
I'm trying to do is keep you
from becoming an old maid.

15:19.988 --> 15:21.437
Don't worry, I won't.

15:21.437 --> 15:23.301
Some day the right man
will come along.

15:23.301 --> 15:25.821
Uh-huh. And he's going to
keep right on going along

15:25.821 --> 15:27.996
if you don't stop being
so old-fashioned.

15:27.996 --> 15:29.859
Old-fashioned?
Yeah.

15:29.859 --> 15:32.690
There ain't nothing wrong
with two single people
having a little fling.

15:32.690 --> 15:34.105
Oh?

15:34.105 --> 15:37.522
Did you have any little
flings before we
were married?

15:37.522 --> 15:39.214
No, but I wasn't old
like her.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.598
And besides, look, if
Hendricks tries anything,

15:44.598 --> 15:46.083
you just tell him you
got a headache.

15:46.083 --> 15:47.429
It works every time.

15:47.429 --> 15:48.740
He's right, Florence.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.226
George had three
headaches last week.

15:53.159 --> 15:54.367
Two!

15:54.367 --> 15:55.955
So what do you say,
Florence, you going to call

15:55.955 --> 15:57.439
Mr. Hendricks and tell him
you're going to go
to Las Vegas?

15:58.060 --> 16:00.200
The answer is no.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.064
I'll make it a
month's salary.

16:02.064 --> 16:03.755
Forget it,
Mr. Jefferson.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.619
If you'll excuse me I'm going
in the kitchen and make myself

16:05.619 --> 16:07.311
a sandwich and
a glass of milk.

16:07.311 --> 16:09.278
And I've got to get to
work on the newsletter.

16:09.278 --> 16:12.523
Florence, wait!
The case is closed,
Mr. Jefferson.

16:12.523 --> 16:15.422
No, it ain't!
And I wish your
mouth was too!

16:16.941 --> 16:18.770
Weezy!
I got work to do.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.014
Hey, Weezy, will you
talk to her for me?

16:21.014 --> 16:24.569
George, Florence doesn't
want to go, you heard
what she said!

16:26.709 --> 16:29.126
Look, she's going to go to Las
Vegas with Mr. Hendricks,
I don't care what she says.

16:31.231 --> 16:33.751
Oh, good, you're still up.
How are you, Mr. J?

16:33.751 --> 16:34.786
Awful.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.857
Oh, dear, what seems
to be the problem?

16:36.857 --> 16:39.791
I'm trying to get
Florence to go
to Las Vegas.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.794
I see. How does
Mrs. Jefferson feel
about that?

16:45.521 --> 16:47.420
She don't like
the idea.

16:47.420 --> 16:48.697
I don't blame her.

16:48.697 --> 16:51.458
But if you need
company, perhaps
I could go with you.

16:51.458 --> 16:53.943
Me? I ain't
going to no
Las Vegas.

16:53.943 --> 16:55.669
Does that mean
I have to go
by myself?

16:58.672 --> 17:00.226
Oh, hello, Mr. Bentley.

17:00.226 --> 17:04.644
Oh, hello, Mrs. J.
I was wondering if I
could borrow four eggs.

17:04.644 --> 17:06.646
Sure, Bentley.
Hey, Florence!

17:08.234 --> 17:09.269
Yeah?

17:09.269 --> 17:10.615
Bentley wants
four eggs.

17:10.615 --> 17:13.239
I ain't no
short-order cook!

17:13.239 --> 17:16.621
Look, you ain't no kind
of cook. Just bring
the man four eggs, will ya?

17:18.623 --> 17:21.212
Isn't it a little late
to be cooking,
Mr. Bentley?

17:21.212 --> 17:25.044
Oh, no, I'm getting
ready to have breakfast
with Rebecca.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.080
Breakfast?
It's almost midnight.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.530
Not for Sydney.

17:28.530 --> 17:30.773
Sydney who?
Sydney, Australia.

17:30.773 --> 17:33.328
You're eating
breakfast in Australia?

17:33.328 --> 17:35.537
Uh, no, but
Rebecca is.

17:35.537 --> 17:38.885
But you said that...
You see, Rebecca is
an airline stewardess.

17:38.885 --> 17:42.061
And we had planned to have
breakfast together tomorrow
morning in my apartment,

17:42.061 --> 17:43.579
but I'm afraid she
got fogged in.

17:45.236 --> 17:47.997
Oh, that makes two
of you, Bentley.

17:47.997 --> 17:51.415
How perceptive of you,
Mr. J, I do have
a slight head cold.

17:51.415 --> 17:55.660
Anyway, after she called
we agreed to have breakfast
together over the phone.

17:55.660 --> 17:57.938
Oh, what a nice idea.

17:57.938 --> 18:01.666
Yes. Of course, it's not
as nice as having her
here for the weekend.

18:01.666 --> 18:04.013
You mean Rebecca was
going to spend the
weekend with you?

18:04.013 --> 18:05.567
Indeed she was.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.120
Oh.
Here's your eggs,
Mr. Bentley.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.365
Well, thank you.
Say that to Florence.

18:10.365 --> 18:13.782
I beg your pardon?
Go on, tell that
to Florence.

18:13.782 --> 18:16.233
All right, uh,
"Here's your eggs,
Mr. Bentley."

18:18.442 --> 18:22.308
Not that. I mean about you
and Rebecca spending the
weekend together, yeah...

18:22.308 --> 18:25.932
Oh, all right. Rebecca
and I were going to
spend the weekend together,

18:25.932 --> 18:29.211
she's an airline
stewardess, but
she got fogged in.

18:29.211 --> 18:31.869
In Australia.
You don't really want
to hear this, do you?

18:32.697 --> 18:34.354
No.

18:34.354 --> 18:37.116
The point is that neither
one of you are married.
Right, Bentley?

18:37.116 --> 18:39.911
Oh, no, I don't think
either of us is ready
yet for marriage.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.638
Great. And you don't
have anything against
Rebecca and you

18:42.638 --> 18:44.088
spending the
weekend together.

18:44.088 --> 18:46.884
Of course not. I'm sure
my parents would be
very happy to hear it.

18:46.884 --> 18:48.334
Hear that, Florence?

18:48.334 --> 18:50.750
Yes, my sister and I
haven't seen each other
in quite some time.

18:53.062 --> 18:54.202
Your sister?

18:54.202 --> 18:57.032
Yes, my sister Rebecca.
We're very close.

18:57.032 --> 19:00.587
If I had a brother, I
wouldn't mind spending the
weekend with him either.

19:01.692 --> 19:03.142
You're a big
help, Bentley.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.454
Oh, so are
you, Mr. J.

19:05.454 --> 19:07.456
Thank you for the eggs.
Yeah.

19:07.456 --> 19:08.595
Good night, Mrs. J.

19:08.595 --> 19:10.183
Good night.

19:10.183 --> 19:13.290
Oh, Mr. J, if you change
your mind about going
to Las Vegas,

19:13.290 --> 19:14.774
be sure to
let me know.

19:14.774 --> 19:16.983
I am hot stuff
at the tables.

19:16.983 --> 19:19.882
Last time I
was there I won
three dollars...

19:25.405 --> 19:27.235
Hope I can still
get in touch
with Hendricks.

19:27.235 --> 19:30.307
Damn it, Bentley!

19:30.307 --> 19:32.792
You want some more eggs,
go buy a chicken!

19:35.243 --> 19:37.728
Hey, Mr. Hendricks!

19:37.728 --> 19:39.902
Come on in!
Am I welcome?

19:39.902 --> 19:41.801
Are you kidding?
Of course you're
welcome.

19:41.801 --> 19:45.322
That's just one of my
little jokes, I know how much
you like a good joke.

19:45.322 --> 19:48.946
Hey, Weez? Look
who's here! Mr. Hendricks.

19:48.946 --> 19:50.672
Oh, hi.
HENDRICKS: Hello.

19:50.672 --> 19:53.364
Is Florence here?
I'd really like
to talk to her.

19:53.364 --> 19:54.952
You and me both!

19:54.952 --> 19:57.126
Look, I'd like
to apologize for
the way she acted.

19:57.126 --> 19:59.991
No, I'm the one
who should
apologize.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.201
Oh, what are
you doing here?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.617
Well, I just came
by to say that
I was sorry.

20:04.617 --> 20:07.102
Okay, you said it.
Goodbye.

20:07.102 --> 20:08.828
Look, Florence, please.

20:08.828 --> 20:11.969
Look, I know I came on a
little strong when I asked you
to go to Las Vegas,

20:11.969 --> 20:14.937
but I didn't mean for
you to think that I was
trying to hit on you.

20:14.937 --> 20:16.042
You didn't?

20:16.042 --> 20:18.251
No, no, I thought
you'd enjoy it!

20:18.251 --> 20:20.598
The fact is, I'm going
to be tied up in
business all weekend,

20:20.598 --> 20:22.393
and I won't have
time for much else.

20:23.152 --> 20:24.223
You won't?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.397
I won't.
But the offer's
still open.

20:27.536 --> 20:29.228
You promise?
No hanky-panky?

20:30.159 --> 20:32.852
I promise.
Cross my heart.

20:32.852 --> 20:37.063
Unless of course, you find
me too irresistible and that
would disappoint me.

20:37.063 --> 20:39.479
Because I'm sure
you have better
taste than that.

20:40.204 --> 20:41.516
Well?

20:42.793 --> 20:44.035
What do you think,
Miss Jefferson?

20:44.035 --> 20:47.970
Well, I think he
means what he
says, Florence.

20:47.970 --> 20:51.146
And I think you
should go.
If you want to.

20:51.146 --> 20:54.253
Okay, if that's
what you think,
that's what I think.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.255
Oh, good. I'm glad
you're going to go.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.428
What time
do we leave?

20:57.428 --> 20:59.223
I'll pick you up
at 8:00 in the morning.

20:59.223 --> 21:01.363
8:00? I better
start packing!

21:01.363 --> 21:04.746
Oh, don't forget that
money you owe me.
I'll need it for gambling.

21:08.370 --> 21:10.338
What money?

21:10.338 --> 21:13.341
The month's pay
you promised me,
remember?

21:13.341 --> 21:17.103
Oh, yeah!

21:17.103 --> 21:19.312
Well, good night,
everybody. See you in the
morning, Mr. Hendricks.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.865
Good night.

21:20.865 --> 21:22.902
Sleep tight, don't let the
bed bugs bite!

21:30.254 --> 21:33.153
Excuse me for asking
this, Mr. Hendricks,

21:33.153 --> 21:37.192
but if you're going to be
so busy, why do you want
Florence to go with you?

21:37.192 --> 21:40.229
Well, if you really
want to know the
truth, Mrs. Jefferson,

21:40.229 --> 21:42.266
I've always been
the kind of man who
played my hunches.

21:42.266 --> 21:45.683
And I've got a very
big hunch that Florence
is lucky for me.

21:45.683 --> 21:47.582
You know, I think
she's lucky for
me, too!

21:47.582 --> 21:49.480
Now, about that
property you got that
I want to lease.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.690
Yeah, well, I think we're
going to have to forget
about that, Jefferson.

21:52.690 --> 21:54.865
But you said we'd talk
about it when you got
back with Florence.

21:54.865 --> 21:57.350
That was when I still
owned the property.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.869
Say what?

21:58.869 --> 22:01.078
Well, that's what I meant
about Florence being
lucky for me.

22:01.078 --> 22:03.080
You see, the guy
I met at the disco,

22:03.080 --> 22:06.117
he offered me such a
great amount of money
to purchase that property,

22:06.117 --> 22:08.085
well, I couldn't
turn it down.

22:08.085 --> 22:09.914
But I wanted
to lease it!

22:09.914 --> 22:11.571
Yes, well, I don't think
there's any chance of that.

22:11.571 --> 22:13.435
He's going to build
a supermarket there.

22:13.435 --> 22:14.816
A supermarket!

22:14.816 --> 22:16.507
And I don't
think he'll
change his mind.

22:16.507 --> 22:20.304
But if you want to call
him, his name is
Larry Kelly.

22:20.304 --> 22:22.099
Larry Kelly.

22:22.099 --> 22:25.965
Yeah. Well, I'll see you
later, Jefferson. I'm sorry
about our business deal.

22:25.965 --> 22:27.138
Good night,
Mrs. Jefferson.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.277
Good night.

22:30.314 --> 22:32.074
Where are you
going, George?

22:32.074 --> 22:33.179
I'm going to tell
Florence she ain't
going to Las Vegas.

22:33.179 --> 22:34.905
What?

22:34.905 --> 22:38.011
You don't think I'm going
to let her run off with
some total stranger!

22:38.011 --> 22:40.842
Forget it, George,
there's no way
to stop her!

22:40.842 --> 22:43.948
Beside, you don't want
her turning out to be
an old maid, remember?

22:43.948 --> 22:46.951
What's the matter with
Florence, ain't she
got no morals?

22:46.951 --> 22:50.161
She's just going
to spend the weekend
with a total stranger.

22:50.161 --> 22:54.442
George, it was wrong to
use Florence to try to influence
Mr. Hendricks.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.514
Yeah, you right,
Weez. As usual.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.896
Well, no harm done.

23:02.657 --> 23:04.969
Who you calling?
Information.

23:04.969 --> 23:07.316
What did Hendricks
say that guy's
name was, again?

23:07.316 --> 23:09.180
Oh, Larry Kelly.
I gotta talk to him.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.803
Why?

23:10.803 --> 23:13.288
I want to tell
him what a funny
maid I got.

23:13.288 --> 23:17.396
Oh, no, you don't! I'm not
going to let you use
Florence like that again.

23:18.535 --> 23:19.812
Yeah, you right, Weezy.

23:19.812 --> 23:22.193
Hey! What about you?
You know any
good jokes?

23:24.299 --> 23:25.542
What?

23:25.542 --> 23:26.991
I can tell Kelly what
a funny wife I've got,

23:26.991 --> 23:30.098
and when he comes
up here, you can insult me!

23:30.098 --> 23:32.307
George!
Oh, you can
do it, Weezy!

23:32.307 --> 23:34.240
Remember the other day,
when you were mad at me,
what you said?

23:34.240 --> 23:38.520
Yeah! "You may not be
very big, but at least
you got a brain to match."

23:38.520 --> 23:40.626
Yeah! Yeah, that's it!

23:40.626 --> 23:42.559
Oh, forget it!
Oh, come on, Weezy,
you can do it!

23:53.259 --> 23:55.882
Florence, it sound like
you had a nice time.

23:55.882 --> 23:58.298
Yeah, it sure was nice
to get away from here
for a while.

23:58.298 --> 24:02.095
Yeah, it was nice having
you away from here
for a while, too.

24:02.095 --> 24:04.166
What about my two dollars
I asked you to play
at roulette?

24:04.166 --> 24:06.824
Oh, yeah, I put it on
number 25, just like
you said.

24:06.824 --> 24:08.481
25? I said 35!

24:08.481 --> 24:10.103
You did?
Yeah, you can't do
nothing right!

24:10.103 --> 24:11.553
Just give me back
my two dollars.

24:11.553 --> 24:13.693
But I...
But nothing, give me back
my two dollars, please.

24:13.693 --> 24:14.729
Okay.

24:19.630 --> 24:21.770
One, two.

24:21.770 --> 24:23.910
Florence, where
did you get all that money?

24:23.910 --> 24:26.913
At the roulette table!
I put his two dollars
on number 25!

24:49.211 --> 24:52.939
LOUISE: The Jeffersonswas
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.574
Movin',
movin' on up
