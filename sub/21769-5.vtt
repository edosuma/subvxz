WEBVTT

00:02.870 --> 00:05.405
OH MY GOODNESS,
I REALLY LOVE
THIS SWEATER--

00:05.472 --> 00:08.609
LIKE BELTED
OVER SOME LEGGINGS
OR SKINNY JEANS,

00:08.675 --> 00:10.611
AND I PROMISE YOU,
IF YOU PUT THIS ON
FOR A DATE,

00:10.677 --> 00:14.748
SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE
PEELING IT OFF.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.717
IT'S JUST A SWEATER.

00:16.783 --> 00:21.388
IT'S-- IT'S WARMISH,
BUT NOT AS WARM AS A COAT.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.990
YOU KNOW WHO HAS
GREAT COATS?

00:23.056 --> 00:25.158
THE DEPARTMENT STORE
DOWN THE STREET.

00:25.225 --> 00:28.262
GET OVER THERE.

00:28.328 --> 00:32.165
HEY, JO,
WHO WORE IT BETTER--
CRASH TEST DUMMY OR ME?

00:33.667 --> 00:36.503
WELL, IT WORKS
ON BOTH OF YOU,
BUT IT'S HER JOB

00:36.570 --> 00:39.273
TO STAND AROUND
IN A SCARF DOING NOTHING.

00:39.339 --> 00:41.608
I'M NOT DOING
NOTHING, PAUL.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.277
THIS IS WORK.
LET ME EXPLAIN.

00:43.343 --> 00:47.214
YOUR CUSTOMERS COME IN,
THEY SEE ME LOOKING
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING

00:47.281 --> 00:52.252
AND THEY SAY,
"WOW, IF THAT FINE
AND ADORABLE YOUNG LADY

00:52.319 --> 00:57.090
CAN PUT ON THIS SCARF,
I CAN PUT IT ON TOO."

00:58.592 --> 01:02.429
AND THEN I COME IN
AND CLOSE THE DEAL.

01:02.496 --> 01:03.997
THAT'S RIGHT,
BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONE

01:04.064 --> 01:06.133
WHO KNOWS HOW TO WORK
THE CASH REGISTER.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.735
FINE, I JUST NEED
A LITTLE MORE FOCUS,

01:08.802 --> 01:11.672
ESPECIALLY WITH CORPORATE
COMING FOR THEIR ANNUAL
INSPECTION NEXT WEEK.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.774
AND IF I HAVE TO COME
OVER THERE MYSELF,

01:13.841 --> 01:16.276
I SWEAR I'M GONNA TAKE IT OFF
WITH A SOCKET WRENCH.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.312
CALM IT DOWN, PAUL.
CALM IT DOWN.

01:18.378 --> 01:20.047
NOT YOU, NOT YOU.

01:20.113 --> 01:21.715
A MANNEQUIN ISSUE
IN ACTIVEWEAR.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.417
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE,
BETTY.

01:23.483 --> 01:25.886
NOW DO EITHER OF YOU TWO
WANNA HELP OUT IN THE CAVE?

01:25.953 --> 01:28.422
THE CAVE--
THAT'S WITH THE WALLETS
AND THE BELTS, RIGHT?

01:28.488 --> 01:29.923
- MM-HMM.
- OH NO, NOT ME.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.659
I-- I CAN'T TOLERATE
THE SMELL OF ANIMAL HIDE.

01:32.726 --> 01:36.396
I WAS ABANDONED
AT THE PETTING ZOO
ON A THIRD GRADE FIELD TRIP.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.399
HERE WE GO.

01:39.466 --> 01:43.070
I SURVIVED
ON PELLETS AND HAY.

01:43.136 --> 01:46.840
- IT WAS 20 MINUTES.
- OKAY, FINE FINE.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.976
I WILL FIND SOMEONE ELSE
FOR THE CAVE,

01:49.042 --> 01:51.411
BUT PLEASE, YOU TWO,
PLEASE, FOCUS.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.681
MM, POOR PAUL.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.117
CAN YOU IMAGINE YOUR WHOLE LIFE
BEING ABOUT THIS STORE?

01:57.184 --> 01:59.353
UGH, SHOOT ME.

01:59.419 --> 02:01.488

02:06.326 --> 02:07.961
YEAH. DOUG.

02:08.028 --> 02:10.564
HI, DOUG.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.771
- ARE-- ARE YOU
CHECKING HIM OUT?
- NO NO.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.274
I'M JUST NOTICING
THAT HIS, UM--
HIS SHOULDERS

02:20.340 --> 02:22.442
ARE TECHNICALLY BROADER
THAN THEY NEED TO BE.

02:22.509 --> 02:25.345
YOU TOTALLY DIG HIM.

02:25.412 --> 02:29.016
NO NO, I'M JUST--
I'M FEELING FLUTTERY
AND I'M QUEASY,

02:29.082 --> 02:31.418
LIKE WHEN I HAD TO DRINK
THE GOAT MILK TO SURV--

02:31.485 --> 02:33.420
IT WAS 20 MINUTES!

02:48.969 --> 02:51.672
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID NOT
GET THAT AUDITION...

02:54.174 --> 02:57.611
IS SOMETHING
I AM NOT SAYING TODAY!

02:57.678 --> 03:00.214
THAT'S GREAT!
WHAT IS IT FOR?

03:00.280 --> 03:02.449
WELL, IT'S FOR
ALL-CITY MATTRESS,

03:08.155 --> 03:10.357
HOW MANY OVERNIGHT
MATTRESS WHOLESALERS

03:10.424 --> 03:12.593
ARE THERE IN NEW YORK?
I MEAN YAY!

03:13.994 --> 03:15.929
I KNOW IT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE MUCH,

03:15.996 --> 03:17.965
BUT IT'LL BE THE FIRST
PROFESSIONAL JOB

03:18.031 --> 03:21.134
I'LL BE ABLE TO PUT
ON MY ACTING REEL.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.303
HEY, DO WE HAVE
ANY VACATION DAYS?

03:23.370 --> 03:27.007
YES, BUT YOU USED ALL SEVEN
ON YOUR FIRST WEEK.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.277
THAT WAS A GOOD WEEK.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.546
WELL, MY AUDITION
IS IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR SHIFT,

03:32.613 --> 03:34.748
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
COVER FOR ME WITH PAUL.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.450
NO PROBLEM.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.918
( SIGHS )
THIS IS SO ANNOYING.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.320
I CAN HACK INTO THE F.B.I.,
BUT I CAN'T GET

03:40.387 --> 03:42.055
INTO THE STORE'S
PERSONNEL FILES.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.827
WHO ARE YOU, DOUG?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.462
I KNEW YOU WERE CRUSHING
ON THAT GUY.

03:48.529 --> 03:51.765
I AM A GRAD STUDENT
IN PHYSICS

03:51.832 --> 03:53.500
AND HE SPEAKS
IN GRUNTS.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.139
THERE MUST BE A REASON
WHY I'M FEELING THIS WAY.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.941
<i>OKAY, WHAT ELSE</i>
<i>DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM?</i>

04:01.008 --> 04:03.610
HIS NAME IS DOUG.
HE HAS A BEARD.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.512
OKAY, DO NOT GOOGLE
"BEARDED DOUG."

04:07.614 --> 04:11.852
WHOO, I DID NOT KNOW
THAT WAS A THING.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.188
ENOUGH WITH
ALL THE SHOUTING.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.756
AW, WE'RE JUST TALKING,
AUNT HONEY.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.029
ONE WANTS SHERRY
AND ONE WANTS GIN.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.798
IF THEY'D JUST BE QUIET,
I'D MAKE THEM BOTH HAPPY.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.435
AUNT HONEY, HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN ATTRACTED TO A MAN

04:28.502 --> 04:29.970
JUST BECAUSE
OF HIS BODY?

04:30.037 --> 04:32.639

HE WAS A GOLD MEDALIST

AND OTHER THINGS.

04:48.655 --> 04:51.592

OH, YOU GIRLS ARE FILTHY.

04:51.658 --> 04:54.761
WELL, JO LIKES A GUY AT WORK
AND SHE'S OVERTHINKING IT.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.965
WELL, SOME MEN ARE WORTH
TURNING YOUR BRAIN OFF FOR.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.300
I DID NOT HAVE
A SINGLE THOUGHT

05:00.367 --> 05:02.936

MONTREAL OLYMPICS.

05:03.003 --> 05:06.440

05:09.376 --> 05:12.346
I HAVE TO PICK UP
MY FUR COAT FROM STORAGE.

05:12.412 --> 05:14.348
AUNT HONEY, NO.
YOU STILL HAVE THAT THING?

05:14.414 --> 05:18.919
I'D RATHER WALK DOWN
FIFTH AVENUE NAKED
THAN WEAR FUR.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.821
WELL, CAN'T A LADY
DO BOTH?

05:27.794 --> 05:29.329
WHERE IS GEORGIA?

05:29.396 --> 05:32.900
WE HAVE DISCUSSED
YOU TALKING TO GUESTS
WITHOUT HER AROUND.

05:32.966 --> 05:36.270
SHE IS AROUND, OF COURSE,
BECAUSE IT'S HER SHIFT.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.438
SO WHY WOULDN'T
SHE BE AROUND?

05:38.505 --> 05:40.807
SO WHERE IS SHE?

05:40.874 --> 05:43.343

06:38.131 --> 06:39.900
OR IS IT 1?
WHICH WAY DO THE NUMBERS GO?

06:39.967 --> 06:42.736
- I THINK UP IS WORSE.
- BUT COUNTING DOWN
DOES SOUND SCARIER.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.439
- UNLESS IT'S NEW YEAR'S EVE.
- OH, AND THEN IT'S FUN.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.475

11:04.031 --> 11:05.933
- HEY!

11:05.999 --> 11:10.470
- THANKS, DOUG!
- OH MY GOODNESS.

11:10.537 --> 11:13.674
JO, UM, I HOPE YOU DON'T
TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,

11:13.740 --> 11:17.978
BUT I THINK DOUG
IS A CAVEMAN.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.980
WHAT?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.982
NO, I MEAN JUST THINK
ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

11:22.049 --> 11:25.118
HE WORKS IN THE CAVE.
HE HAS LONG HAIR.

11:25.185 --> 11:29.089
- HE GRUNTS A LOT.
- HE DID BRING ME FIRE.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.924
BUT NO,
HE'S NOT A CAVEMAN.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.926
THAT'S CRAZY.
THAT'S--

11:32.993 --> 11:34.528
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.

11:34.595 --> 11:37.130
- HEY, DOUG.
- ( GRUNTS ) HI.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.600
MEAT?

11:39.666 --> 11:43.437
OH, IS THIS FROM
THE KEBAB CART OUTSIDE?

11:43.504 --> 11:45.138
I WAS NEVER SURE
ABOUT THAT GUY

11:45.205 --> 11:47.241
BECAUSE HE HAS
THAT ONE CLOUDY EYE,
BUT OKAY.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.112
WHAT EXACTLY IS A KEBAB?

11:52.179 --> 11:54.348
LIKE WHAT PART
OF WHAT ANIMAL?

11:54.414 --> 11:57.084
HMM.
( CLEARS THROAT )

12:11.331 --> 12:13.100
DOUG, GET BACK

12:21.842 --> 12:24.278
OH MY GOD,
DOUG IS A CAVEMAN.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.013

12:27.881 --> 12:30.884
THAT'S WHY
I'M ATTRACTED TO HIM.
IT'S PRIMAL.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.553

HO HO HO.
HEY HEY, TAKE A NOTE.

EVERYTHING AROUND.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.325
WHAT WHAT?
WHAT WAS THAT?

13:11.391 --> 13:13.260
WE'RE GONNA BE REARRANGING
THE ENTIRE FLOOR.

13:13.327 --> 13:15.028
WHEN CORPORATE COMES,
I NEED TO WOW THEM.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.763
SO WE'RE GONNA BE MOVING
THIS SECTION AROUND

13:16.830 --> 13:18.398
ALL NIGHT

13:18.465 --> 13:22.769
AND I HAVE NOT
FELT WOWED SINCE I SAW
"SEX AND THE CITY 2."

13:22.836 --> 13:25.772
OH, DOUG, PERFECT.
YEAH, JUST DRAG HER OFF
TO THE CAVE.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.008

13:32.212 --> 13:34.948
I CAN STAY LATE,

13:35.015 --> 13:37.851
AHEM YES, PAUL,
BUT NOT ME.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.419
I HAVE SOMETHING
I GOTTA DO.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.988
I TOLD EVERYONE
TO CANCEL THEIR PLANS.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.589
YES, BUT I CAN'T
CANCEL THIS.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.725
IT'S-- IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.094
IT'S FOR THE WORK
THAT I<i>WANT</i>TO DO.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.663
I'M SORRY, BUT I NEED
EVERYONE HERE.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.699
BUT I NEED
THIS COMMERCIAL.

13:52.766 --> 13:56.270
SO... I'M GONNA GO.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.606
IF YOU LEAVE,
DON'T BOTHER
COMING BACK.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.708
YOU MEAN TOMORROW?

14:01.775 --> 14:04.811
WHEN I COME IN
FOR WORK?

14:04.878 --> 14:07.481
WITH JELLY DOUGHNUTS?

14:07.548 --> 14:08.649
I MEAN EVER.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.918
IF YOU LEAVE,
YOU ARE FIRED.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.721
OKAY, PAUL,
I UNDERSTAND

14:14.788 --> 14:16.590
THAT YOU'RE ALL ABOUT
THIS STORE.

14:16.657 --> 14:19.193
AND YOU PROBABLY WANNA
RUN IT SOMEDAY, RIGHT?

14:19.259 --> 14:22.930
IT'S PROBABLY YOUR DREAM.
AND IF IT IS, I GET IT.
I'M COOL WITH THAT.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.965
BUT WHAT I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU GET

14:25.032 --> 14:28.435
IS THAT I'VE GOT
BIGGER DREAMS.

14:28.502 --> 14:32.039
AND SO...
I'M GONNA GO.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.540
JO, LET'S GO.

14:33.607 --> 14:36.777
- GEORGIA...
- GEORGIA WHAT?
WE NEED TO LEAVE.

14:36.844 --> 14:40.814
WELL, YOU NEED TO LEAVE
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A THING,
BUT IT'S NOT MY THING.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.716
WELL, THEN
WHAT'S YOUR THING?

14:42.783 --> 14:44.384
IT IS DOUG?
IS DOUG YOUR THING?

14:44.451 --> 14:46.220
NO, IT'S--
IT'S NOT JUST DOUG.

14:46.286 --> 14:50.557
- THIS IS MY JOB.
- BUT I'M YOUR FRIEND.

14:50.624 --> 14:53.727
MY FRIEND WOULDN'T ASK ME
TO LEAVE MY JOB.

14:53.794 --> 14:56.864
OKAY.
THAT'S FINE.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.398
<i>NO WORRIES.</i>

14:58.465 --> 15:01.568
I'M GONNA GO.
I'M GONNA LEAVE.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.775
DANG.

15:19.253 --> 15:24.324
MAKEUP, HOT ROLLERS
AND SIX PAIR OF HEELS?

15:24.391 --> 15:26.627
YOU GOING CAMPING?

15:26.693 --> 15:28.595
NO, THIS IS
FOR MY COMMERCIAL.

15:28.662 --> 15:31.198
SEE, THEY'RE TIGHT
ON THEIR BUDGET

15:31.265 --> 15:35.602
AND SO I DECIDED
TO BRING MY OWN HAIR,
MAKEUP AND LIGHTING.

15:35.669 --> 15:37.271
<i>( CHUCKLES )</i>

15:37.337 --> 15:39.106
WHERE'S JO?

15:39.173 --> 15:43.043
WELL, THAT JERKY
MANAGER OF OURS MADE
EVERYONE STAY LATE.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.947
- AREN'T YOU EVERYONE?
- I HAD TO QUIT.

15:47.014 --> 15:50.050
YOU QUIT, DIDN'T GIVE NOTICE
AND YOU LEFT YOUR BEST FRIEND?

15:50.117 --> 15:52.753
I FEEL A LECTURE COMING ON,
SO I JUST WANNA SAY

15:52.819 --> 15:54.488
IT'S GONNA BE
VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR

15:54.555 --> 15:56.823
OVER THE SCREAMS
OF A DOZEN DEAD MINKS.

15:56.890 --> 15:58.325
A DOZEN?

15:58.392 --> 16:02.829
SWEETHEART, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW SMALL MINKS ARE.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.233
IT'S FUNNY.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.970
WHEN MY FIRST HUSBAND,
MR. DUPREE, BOUGHT THIS
FOR ME--

16:10.037 --> 16:15.108
OH, I DREAMED OF HAVING
A FUR COAT FOR SO LONG.

16:15.175 --> 16:20.347
I THOUGHT IF I PUT IT ON,
IT WOULD MAKE ME SOMEBODY.

16:20.414 --> 16:21.949
<i>( CHUCKLES )</i>

16:22.015 --> 16:24.151
BUT AFTER TALKING
TO YOU GIRLS,

16:24.218 --> 16:29.089
I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO BE
THAT KIND OF SOMEBODY ANYMORE.

16:29.156 --> 16:33.727
HMM, MIGHT BE TIME
FOR A NEW DREAMCOAT.

16:33.794 --> 16:36.230
( CHUCKLES )
OH MY GOODNESS!

16:36.296 --> 16:40.901
I JUST REMEMBERED HOW I KNOW
THAT STORE MANAGER OF YOURS.

16:40.968 --> 16:44.104
- HE SOLD YOU A COAT?
- NO.

16:44.171 --> 16:48.976
"JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING
TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT"
YEARS AGO ON BROADWAY.

16:49.042 --> 16:53.347
- OH, SO HE CHECKED YOUR COAT.
- NO. HE WORE THE COAT.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.717
HE WAS JOSEPH
AND HE WAS DAMN GOOD TOO.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.286
YOU MEAN PAUL
WAS AN ACTOR?

17:01.054 --> 17:02.923
THEN WHY IS HE WORKING
AT THE STORE?

17:02.990 --> 17:06.460
YOU KNOW, GEORGIA,
ANY DREAM YOU HAVE--

17:06.527 --> 17:08.929
SOMEONE ELSE
HAS HAD BEFORE.

17:08.996 --> 17:11.765
<i>THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS.</i>

17:11.832 --> 17:15.235
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU SHOULDN'T CHASE
YOUR DREAMS,

17:15.302 --> 17:17.171
BUT YOU'D BETTER LIKE
WHO YOU ARE

17:17.237 --> 17:19.940
WHEN YOU CATCH THEM, HMM?

17:20.007 --> 17:24.545
AH! WELL, WILL YOU LOOK
AT THIS-- $100.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.414
I'M GONNA GO PLAY
MY NUMBERS.

17:36.290 --> 17:39.059
OH, THAT LOOKS GREAT,
JEANETTE.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.595
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?
PUT THE PINK ONES UP ON TOP.

17:41.662 --> 17:45.232
PINK MAKES
THE LADIES CRAZY.
( CHUCKLES )

17:45.299 --> 17:47.367
YEAH.

17:47.434 --> 17:50.237
WELL, GEORGIA.

17:50.304 --> 17:52.606
DO YOU MIND IF I START
WITH THE SCARVES?

17:52.673 --> 17:56.109
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A COMMERCIAL TO SHOOT.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.111
WELL, I TOLD THEM
I HAD TO WORK,

17:58.178 --> 18:00.614
SO THEY FOUND SOMEONE
TO REPLACE ME.

18:00.681 --> 18:03.383
OH, HONEY,
THEY ALWAYS DO.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.219
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU IN "JOSEPH"?

18:05.285 --> 18:07.421
WELL, A LOT OF THINGS
HAPPENED TO ME,

18:07.487 --> 18:09.489
BUT I WOULDN'T CHANGE
ANY OF THEM

18:09.556 --> 18:13.026
BECAUSE I THINK
I ENDED UP EXACTLY
WHERE I AM SUPPOSED TO BE.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.463
AND THAT'S GOOD.

18:16.530 --> 18:19.733
BUT I DON'T THINK
THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.435
REALLY?

18:21.502 --> 18:24.271
COME ON, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S ALWAYS SAYING YOU'RE
GONNA BE A STAR.

18:24.338 --> 18:25.839
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I SAY THAT,

18:25.906 --> 18:27.774
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF I ALWAYS BELIEVE IT.

18:27.841 --> 18:30.511
WELL, I WOULD BET ON IT.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.179
- YOU WOULD?
- SURE.

18:32.246 --> 18:35.616
- YOU'RE A BIGGER
DRAMA QUEEN THAN I AM.
- AW, THANK YOU.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.918
BUT CAN I GIVE YOU
A LITTLE ADVICE,

18:37.985 --> 18:39.753
- JUST ACTOR TO ACTOR?
- YES, PLEASE.

18:39.820 --> 18:43.090
NO MATTER HOW HUNGRY
AND DESPERATE YOU ARE,

18:43.156 --> 18:45.759
IF SIR ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER
WANTS THE LAST PIECE

18:45.826 --> 18:49.830
OF SHRIMP TOAST,
YOU LET HIM HAVE IT.

18:49.897 --> 18:52.466
THANK YOU FOR THAT
LITTLE PIECE OF INFO.

18:52.533 --> 18:56.403
OH, AND THAT REMINDS ME,
I GOT YOU A BOX OF MOONPIES.

18:56.470 --> 19:00.340
I PUT IT IN THE BACK
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW STRESSFUL
THIS JOB IS FOR YOU.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.909
PAUL?

19:04.011 --> 19:07.114
BOTH:
HEY. SORRY.

19:07.181 --> 19:11.318
WHY ARE YOU APOLOGIZING?
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS?

19:11.385 --> 19:13.353
- I GET TO APOLOGIZE.
- I AM SO SORRY.

19:13.420 --> 19:17.057
GEORGIA, RESPECT
THE ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR.

19:17.124 --> 19:18.559
I KNOW, BUT LISTEN.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.827
I AM REALLY SORRY
THAT I DRAGGED YOU
INTO MY FIGHT.

19:20.894 --> 19:22.329
GEORGIA,
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

19:22.396 --> 19:24.398
YOUR FIGHTS--
THEY'RE MY FIGHTS.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.867
I WAS GOING TO APOLOGIZE
FOR NOT COMING WITH YOU,

19:26.934 --> 19:29.870
BECAUSE 99% OF THE TIME
I WILL FOLLOW YOU ANYWHERE.

19:29.937 --> 19:34.341
BUT SOMETIMES I JUST NEED
TO CHASE MY OWN THING,

19:34.408 --> 19:36.677
AND TONIGHT
WAS ONE OF THEM.

19:37.878 --> 19:39.479
IT'S OKAY.

19:39.546 --> 19:42.182
OH, THERE'S YOUR THING.
HOW'S THE CHASE?

19:42.249 --> 19:44.618
- OH NO, I DIDN'T--
- AH AH. JO, STOP IT.

19:44.685 --> 19:46.486
YOU'D BETTER BE GLAD
I CAME BACK.

19:46.553 --> 19:49.923
NOW, PEBBLES,
GO GET BAMM-BAMM.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.230
- HI, DOUG.
- HI.

19:56.296 --> 20:00.400
- AHEM, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO OUT SOMETIME WITH ME?
- SURE.

20:00.467 --> 20:03.504
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE?

20:03.570 --> 20:07.407
- I MAKE FURNITURE.
- OF COURSE YOU DO.

20:07.474 --> 20:10.210
LIKE BIG, ROUGH
WOODEN FURNITURE.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.679
YOU PROBABLY CHOP DOWN
THE TREES YOURSELF.

20:12.746 --> 20:15.015
NO NO, MY PIECES
ARE SMALLER.

20:15.082 --> 20:16.750
OH, LIKE KIDS' FURNITURE.

20:16.817 --> 20:19.253
LET ME JUST SHOW YOU.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.822
OH WOW.

20:21.889 --> 20:23.824
DOLL FURNITURE.

20:23.891 --> 20:25.926
YOU KNOW,
YOU SOUND LIKE MY MOM.

20:25.993 --> 20:28.428
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THE BASEMENT ALL DAY,
DOUGIE?"

20:28.495 --> 20:31.198
"UGH, NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,
FRANCIS!"

20:32.666 --> 20:35.068
I WILL TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT IT
WHEN WE GO OUT.

20:35.135 --> 20:36.670
- HOW'S FRIDAY?
- GREAT.

20:36.737 --> 20:38.906
- GREAT.
- LET'S LEAVE
FROM WORK, OKAY?

20:38.972 --> 20:42.042
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

20:42.109 --> 20:45.879
- CAN WE QUIT THURSDAY?
- HOW ABOUT WEDNESDAY, SWEETIE?
HOW ABOUT WEDNESDAY?

20:54.254 --> 20:57.457
OH MAN, I THOUGHT
WE WOULD NEVER GET
OUT OF THERE.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.426
COULD HAVE BEEN HOME
AN HOUR AGO,

20:59.493 --> 21:02.930
BUT SOMEONE HAD
TO SING SHOW TUNES
AND EAT MOONPIES WITH PAUL.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.901
I DO ENJOY A SONG
AND A SNACK CAKE.

21:07.968 --> 21:11.338
MY, YOU GIRLS
ARE HOME LATE.

21:11.405 --> 21:13.140
AND YOU'RE UP LATE.

21:13.207 --> 21:16.844
WELL, AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE
IS VISITING,

21:16.910 --> 21:20.013
BOUGHT ME
A NEW DREAMCOAT.

HUH? HUH?
