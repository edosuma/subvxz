WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:04.874
<i>Heroes.</i>

00:04.917 --> 00:07.659
<i>Some are born on the gridiron</i> <i>
and baseball diamonds.</i>

00:07.703 --> 00:11.011
<i>Others are ripped
from the pages of comic books.</i>

00:11.054 --> 00:14.057
<i>But then there are folk heroes,
champions of the common people.</i>

00:14.101 --> 00:19.149
<i>You've heard of them.</i> <i>
John Henry, Johnny Appleseed,</i> <i>
Davy Crockett.</i>

00:19.193 --> 00:22.892
<i>Folk heroes</i> <i>
are symbols of courage</i> <i>
for the oppressed.</i>

00:22.935 --> 00:26.156
<i>Riverdale was being threatened</i> <i>
by a villain with a seemingly</i>

00:26.200 --> 00:28.854
<i>supernatural ability</i> <i>
to control minds.</i>

00:28.898 --> 00:30.421
<i>We needed a hero to defeat him,</i>

00:30.465 --> 00:32.597
<i>one who wouldn't manipulate</i> <i>
our neighbors</i>

00:32.641 --> 00:36.427
<i>towards their worst impulses</i> <i>
but inspire them</i> <i>
to do their best.</i>

00:36.471 --> 00:39.082
<i>We needed</i> <i>
a modern day folk hero.</i>

00:43.391 --> 00:46.220
So, Mr. Pickens,
what brings you
to the Babylonium?

00:46.263 --> 00:47.786
Oh, please call me Percival.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.876
And since I'm the newest
member of the council,

00:50.920 --> 00:53.053
I need a more
permanent home in Riverdale.

00:53.096 --> 00:57.318
And I was hoping to take up
residence in one of
your champagne suites.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.711
No chance.

00:59.755 --> 01:02.671
You came after me and my casino
the second you arrived in town.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.716
Look, I can only
apologize for that.

01:04.760 --> 01:08.677
I... It seems
I've underestimated
the Babylonium's potential.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.332
And yours.

01:11.375 --> 01:14.117
In any case, now that I have
stepped down as deputy

01:14.161 --> 01:15.988
to open up a curiosity shop
in town,

01:16.032 --> 01:18.121
I'm less concerned
with matters of law and order.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.601
Mmm.

01:19.644 --> 01:22.299
Now about that champagne suite,
I can pay you

01:22.343 --> 01:27.826
a year's rent,
a year's back rent,
and a year's security deposit

01:27.870 --> 01:30.090
today, in cash.

01:30.133 --> 01:33.136
Also, not to step on
Kevin Keller's toes,
but I'm quite the crooner.

01:33.180 --> 01:37.749
- Are you now?
- Oh, yes, I've sung Caesar's Palace,

01:37.793 --> 01:39.664
Sydney Opera House,
Moulin Rouge.

01:39.708 --> 01:42.189
Not to brag,
but the ladies love me.

01:43.451 --> 01:46.062
Confidentially, so do the men.

01:46.106 --> 01:50.110
- Cash, you said?
- Cash it is.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.982
- Are you certain about this, Brittania?
- Yes, Mistress Cheryl.

01:53.025 --> 01:56.768
When my parents heard about you
wanting to adopt me,

01:56.812 --> 02:01.425
they thought about it
and they're ready
to accept me for who I am.

02:01.469 --> 02:04.776
In that case, Godspeed.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.126
And thank you.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.779
If not for your efforts,
I would have been trapped

02:07.823 --> 02:10.652
in the corridors
of Abigail Blossom's
mind forever.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.220
For that...

02:13.263 --> 02:15.396
you will always
have a place here.

02:25.188 --> 02:30.150
And next on the agenda
is the Pickens Park
Revitalization Project.

02:32.935 --> 02:37.200
Now, as we all know,
Pickens Park,

02:37.244 --> 02:40.856
once magnificent,
has sadly become blighted.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.728
Drugs, crime, and worse.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.384
Which is why I am so excited

02:47.428 --> 02:50.648
to reveal to you...

02:50.692 --> 02:55.958
the park's future.
As you can see, it will feature
new playgrounds for children,

02:56.001 --> 02:59.614
repaved pathways for cycling,
and where it stood before,

02:59.657 --> 03:02.182
a glorious new statue
of my ancestor,

03:02.225 --> 03:05.924
General Pickens,
the man credited with
taming these wild lands.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.361
You can't be serious, right?

03:07.404 --> 03:10.407
General Pickens
was a homicidal maniac

03:10.451 --> 03:11.713
who slaughtered
the Uktena tribe.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.323
We all learned that
in high school.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.673
Yeah, and I think before
anything is approved,

03:15.717 --> 03:17.806
it's important to remember
why the statue

03:17.849 --> 03:20.200
was removed in the first place.
For a lot of people
in Riverdale,

03:20.243 --> 03:22.419
General Pickens isn't a hero,

03:22.463 --> 03:25.683
but rather an offensive
reminder of our town's
dark history.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.338
Very well.
We'll revisit this,

03:28.382 --> 03:32.124
but in the meantime,
let's move on
to the next order of business.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.039
The new town sign.

03:34.083 --> 03:38.305
Now, the updated design
approved by a majority
of this council...

03:39.871 --> 03:44.006
sadly, won't have room
for the town's slogan.

03:44.049 --> 03:47.270
"Home of
Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe."

03:47.314 --> 03:49.664
So, we'll have
to lose that I'm afraid.

03:49.707 --> 03:52.188
- What's your problem with me?
- Dunno what you mean.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.322
What about the fact that
you decided to remove Pop's
from the town sign?

03:55.365 --> 03:57.280
Well, that's an
aesthetic decision.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.891
Tabitha, I can assure you
I'm not your enemy.

03:59.935 --> 04:02.111
In fact, friendly advice.

04:02.154 --> 04:05.941
Instead of expending
all your energy fighting me,

04:05.984 --> 04:08.378
you should consider
an actual threat
to your livelihood.

04:09.814 --> 04:10.989
Veronica Lodge?

04:11.033 --> 04:13.862
- Her casino.
- What are you talking about?

04:13.905 --> 04:16.821
I probably
shouldn't say anything,
but the council is holding

04:16.865 --> 04:21.086
a special meeting
to approve a billboard
promoting the Babylonium.

04:21.130 --> 04:24.264
Now, since that stretch
of highway is only zoned
for two billboards,

04:24.307 --> 04:27.310
the town's and one other...

04:27.354 --> 04:31.053
shouldn't you be fighting
to make that a Pop's
advertisement instead?

04:32.315 --> 04:33.882
Think about it.

04:38.974 --> 04:41.672
It's like Percival has
has the whole town
in his thrall.

04:41.716 --> 04:44.936
And the irony is,
as far as everyone else
is concerned,

04:44.980 --> 04:47.156
Percival is a great guy.

04:47.199 --> 04:51.769
Oh, except never mind the fact
that he's killed people.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.597
How do you fight mind control?

04:53.641 --> 04:55.295
Actually, there might be a way.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.427
I've been reading this
parapsychology book last night,

04:57.471 --> 05:00.300
and some of the scientists
think that you can
actually resist

05:00.343 --> 05:02.824
mind control through something
called an emotional anchor.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.826
It essentially
acts as a tether,

05:04.869 --> 05:07.350
connecting you
to what you feel like
your core identity is.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.960
And as long as you
stay connected

05:09.004 --> 05:12.660
to whatever that thing is,
he can't get a grasp on you.

05:12.703 --> 05:15.576
Okay, so if I were
one on one with Percival,

05:15.619 --> 05:18.492
I would just think about
my mom or Polly.

05:18.535 --> 05:22.365
Before he gets
his hooks on you, yeah,
you might be able to resist.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.888
That's a great strategy
for us, Jug,

05:23.932 --> 05:26.064
but what about
the rest of the town?

05:26.108 --> 05:28.023
You're right.
Before we try to figure out
what his ultimate plan is,

05:28.066 --> 05:31.766
we have to focus on trying
to free the stranglehold

05:31.809 --> 05:33.245
that he has
on our friends and neighbors.

05:33.289 --> 05:37.337
By beating him at his own game.
Not manipulation.

05:37.380 --> 05:41.036
Inspiration.
The people of the town...

05:41.079 --> 05:45.649
they need to be
reminded of who they are,
what their core values are.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.521
Decency. Kindness. Fairness.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.044
But they need someone
to look up to,

05:49.087 --> 05:52.308
a hero that can point them
in the direction of good.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.832
Archie, that hero
needs to be you.

05:56.530 --> 05:59.184
- What are you talking about?
- You're the closest thing we have

05:59.228 --> 06:02.971
to an authentic American
folk hero who can rouse
people towards good

06:03.014 --> 06:06.670
And what's better than
a homegrown son
of good Fred Andrews,

06:06.714 --> 06:08.324
champion of the common folk?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.457
Not everyone sees me
in that light.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.416
They will, in time, once you
win back the hearts and minds
of the town's people,

06:13.460 --> 06:17.464
including the ones that
are currently under Percival's
supernatural charisma.

06:17.507 --> 06:19.944
- We can stop his mad ascent--
- Vote his ass off the council.

06:19.988 --> 06:25.036
Sign me up. But we can't just
decide Archie's a folk hero
and people will believe him.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.908
No, no,
he'll need to demonstrate it.

06:26.951 --> 06:30.912
But lucky for us,
Archie's already
a legend in the making.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.045
And my ex-literary manager
has a connection

06:34.089 --> 06:36.396
to the Guinness Book of World Records.

06:36.439 --> 06:39.050
Also. Are you still
in touch with K.O. Kelly?
'Cause we might need his help.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.574
Yes.

06:48.799 --> 06:51.976
Stare all you want, Abigail,
but you'll never get out

06:52.020 --> 06:54.762
of that porcelain cage
and into my beautiful body.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.293
Oh, God.

07:04.336 --> 07:07.688
Is it warm in here?

07:35.498 --> 07:37.761
All right, the floor
is now open
for public comment.

07:37.805 --> 07:41.286
I'd like to make
an announcement.

07:41.330 --> 07:44.507
As of today, the El Royale
will be unavailable
for town hall meetings.

07:46.161 --> 07:49.251
I've decided to reopen it
as a boxing gym for local kids.

07:49.294 --> 07:51.122
We sure that's a prudent idea?

07:51.166 --> 07:53.603
The El Royale started out
as a boxing gym.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.649
And for a while
it was a youth center.

07:55.692 --> 07:59.174
This would combine
two of my passions,
physical fitness--

07:59.217 --> 08:02.612
And serving and inspiring
the community.
Filling the youths of Riverdale

08:02.656 --> 08:04.527
with a sense
of personal and civic pride.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.051
Instilling in them
some much needed values.

08:07.095 --> 08:10.751
Leading with compassion,
reminding them to think
for themselves.

08:10.794 --> 08:13.188
I'm sorry.
All due respect, gentlemen,

08:13.231 --> 08:16.278
but ow is this ramshackle place
going to inspire anyone?

08:16.321 --> 08:18.498
Because the El Royale
is about to be world famous.

08:18.541 --> 08:23.503
Owned and operated
by the "World's Toughest
Man Alive," Archie Andrews.

08:23.546 --> 08:27.419
You see, an adjudicator of the
Guinness Book of World Records
will be arriving soon

08:27.463 --> 08:30.248
to watch Archie
perform a set of feats
of human endurance,

08:30.292 --> 08:32.294
I think, need to be seen
to be believed.

08:32.337 --> 08:35.166
So, we would like to invite
everyone far and wide

08:35.210 --> 08:38.648
to come and cheer on.
Riverdale's homegrown
folk hero,

08:38.692 --> 08:40.911
Archie Andrews, "Man of Iron."

08:48.789 --> 08:53.881
Oh, 103, you're burning up
with fever as I suspected.

08:53.924 --> 08:56.144
- Last night, I feared I was burning alive.
- Oh!

08:56.187 --> 08:58.973
Get thee back to bed,
child, and rest.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.279
Thank you for taking care
of me, Nana.

09:01.323 --> 09:04.979
I'm not going
to be taking care of you.
No, no, no,

09:05.022 --> 09:09.200
I must keep vigil
over the doll
and its prisoner, Abigail.

09:09.244 --> 09:12.900
But I will hire a night nurse
to minister to your needs.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.782
Well, we'd like to start
by saying how much
we appreciate

09:25.826 --> 09:29.394
all the time and effort
you both put into
your individual proposals.

09:29.438 --> 09:36.445
But... we are going to go
with the Babylonium billboard.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.055
- Hmm.
- Yes.

09:38.099 --> 09:41.015
Now, while Pop's represents
Riverdale's past,

09:41.058 --> 09:43.278
we wanna look
towards its future.

09:43.321 --> 09:46.281
Percival reminded us
that a casino promises

09:46.324 --> 09:48.500
more revenue for
the town of Riverdale.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.546
Short and long term.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.113
We hope
you understand

09:52.156 --> 09:55.682
Pops will always be
part of Riverdale's...

09:55.725 --> 09:57.161
- Legacy?
- Hmm.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.510
Legacy?

09:58.554 --> 10:02.079
Yes, but also its present
and future, Percival.

10:03.428 --> 10:04.691
Count on it.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.175
- Well, that was rather awkward.
- Yeah.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.264
Should we, uh,
decamp to the El Royale,

10:13.308 --> 10:15.745
see what Archie's
feats of toughness are?

10:15.789 --> 10:17.921
I'm rather curious.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.621
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh</i>

10:22.491 --> 10:24.493

11:39.481 --> 11:42.614
According to
Mr. Guinness, you are now
the World's Toughest Man.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.312
How's it feel?

11:44.355 --> 11:46.706
You know, my dad used to
keep a copy of that book
in the john,

11:46.749 --> 11:49.273
so pretty good, I guess.

11:49.317 --> 11:52.233
And luckily, no one's asked
too many questions
about my "feats".

11:52.276 --> 11:54.539
I feel like we erred on
the right sort of credulity.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.628
Also, um...

11:56.672 --> 11:59.588
did you see how the
entire crowd turned towards you
and away from Percival?

11:59.631 --> 12:01.590
Yeah, he was pissed.

12:01.633 --> 12:05.681
- So what's next?
- So, good news is your statue is almost finished.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.727
Wait. What statue?

12:07.770 --> 12:09.729
The one that I commissioned
from a sculptor friend of mine
back in New York.

12:09.772 --> 12:13.994
Look, Percival is trying
to mythologize his
great grandfather, right?

12:14.037 --> 12:15.691
So, we have to mythologize you.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.172
Jug, I'm not sure
about a statue.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.348
Okay. You're being
too modest, man.

12:20.391 --> 12:22.393
Also, K.O. Kelly
has agreed to the fight,

12:22.437 --> 12:24.918
- so he's all in.
- I'm not sure about that, either.

12:24.961 --> 12:27.834
And wouldn't my powers give me
an unfair advantage
in the ring?

12:27.877 --> 12:30.575
I could hurt him,
not to mention his reputation.

12:30.619 --> 12:33.753
That's the beauty of this plan.
You don't actually have to win.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.363
Well, since K.O.
went professional,

12:35.406 --> 12:37.757
his whole thing is that
he knocks every opponent out

12:37.800 --> 12:39.759
that he fights.
Every single one.
So, technically,

12:39.802 --> 12:42.413
all you have to do
is stay standing
by the time the bell rings.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.589
He's going to get
the technical victory.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.548
But you're going to
get the <i>Rocky-esque,</i>
inspirational victory

12:46.591 --> 12:51.248
and the legend
of Archie Andrews
will just build and build.

12:51.292 --> 12:54.556
I'm sorry the billboard vote
didn't work out
for you, Tabitha.

12:54.599 --> 12:57.820
- I've been trying to get one up for years.
- It's not just that, Toni.

12:57.864 --> 13:01.606
Percival said something
about Babylonium being
a threat to Pop's.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.565
And damned if he isn't right.

13:03.608 --> 13:06.263
I went over my books,
and ever since Veronica
opened up her casino,

13:06.307 --> 13:07.961
my revenue's been going down.

13:08.004 --> 13:09.310
Join the club.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.703
Casinos give out
drinks for free,

13:11.747 --> 13:14.881
so why would anybody come
to the Whyte Wyrm
to pay for them?

13:14.924 --> 13:16.317
I hear you.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.319
But that's the thing.
Unlike the Whyte Wyrm,

13:18.362 --> 13:21.191
we're not direct competition
for the casino,

13:21.235 --> 13:23.106
so why is it eating into
my customer base?

13:23.150 --> 13:25.369
Well, have you been
to the Babylonium yet?

13:25.413 --> 13:27.589
I haven't had
a chance to yet. No.

13:27.632 --> 13:30.461
Well, maybe it's time
we check out our competition.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.641
Mmm.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.687
<i>Danke,</i> Darius.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.297
That was delicious.

13:40.341 --> 13:44.301
And thank you for watching over
my literally hot body

13:44.345 --> 13:46.434
whilst my nana keeps
her own vigil in the chapel.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.828
I was honored
to be asked back, Miss Cheryl.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.831
And after a good night's rest,
hopefully, your fever will have
broken by morning.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.442
From your pillowy lips, Darius.

13:55.356 --> 13:59.012
<i>♪ Is your mouth a little weak</i>

14:00.143 --> 14:03.843
<i>♪ When you open it to speak</i>

14:03.886 --> 14:06.846
<i>♪ Are you smart?</i>

14:08.760 --> 14:10.458
Excuse me.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.286
What do we have here?

14:12.329 --> 14:14.766
We have an assortment of
sliders, tater tots,
and pigs-in-a-blanket.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.246
On the house, of course.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.990
The Babylonium is
serving diner food?

14:21.034 --> 14:22.687
And that's not all.

14:22.731 --> 14:24.254
What is this?

14:24.298 --> 14:26.866
Liquor-infused milkshake shots.
Would you like one?

14:26.909 --> 14:28.868
Oh, hell no.

14:31.914 --> 14:36.266
<i>♪ It's Valentine's Day</i>

14:43.012 --> 14:45.885
Ah! Darius, I feel
so much cooler and fresh.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.538
Your soup must've...

14:51.891 --> 14:53.022
Darius?

14:54.589 --> 14:55.895
Abigail.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.463
What's the matter, child?

14:59.507 --> 15:02.118
Nana, poor Darius
has burned to a crisp.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.946
He's nothing more
than a pile of ash.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.556
I am certain
it's Abigail's doing.

15:05.600 --> 15:09.909
Oh, but the doll,
it hasn't twitched all night.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.740
It's cool to the touch.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.133
What new bedevilment is this?

15:17.177 --> 15:19.701
Archie Andrews,
World's Toughest Man.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.965
K.O. Kelly, the Knockout Champ.
I'm glad you could make it.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.619
I never turn down a good fight.

15:24.662 --> 15:27.970
Holy crap, bro,
you're like a damn rock.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.885
You getting yoked or what?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.974
Must be all
the construction work.

15:32.018 --> 15:35.412
And I appreciate you coming
to town, promoting the gym,
and boosting morale.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.414
Nah, man. I'll go easy on ya.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.200
Hate to ruin that pretty face.
But, uh...

15:40.243 --> 15:42.071
where's your ring?

15:42.115 --> 15:43.768
I'm going to spend
the day setting it up.
Do you want to help me?

15:43.812 --> 15:45.596
Nah, man.

15:45.640 --> 15:49.078
Katy told me
all about Veronica's
new casino.

15:49.122 --> 15:51.211
- Hmm.
- Thought I might check it out.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.778
Yeah. Good call.

15:53.822 --> 15:56.129
Well, you called, I came.

15:57.347 --> 16:00.002
What exactly
am I looking at here?

16:00.046 --> 16:04.615
Cousin, those are
the meager earthly remains
of my night nurse, Darius.

16:04.659 --> 16:08.010
When I fell asleep,
he was sitting in that chair,

16:08.054 --> 16:12.232
and when I awoke,
he had burned to ash.

16:12.275 --> 16:15.061
There are pieces of bone
in here.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.976
And why didn't his feet burn?

16:17.019 --> 16:21.937
Why don't I gather what's
left of Darius and bring him
to Dr. Curdle Jr?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.765
That's step number one.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.288
Okay.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.160
There's no way we can
compete against a casino

16:27.203 --> 16:28.900
with a budget
of a Baz Luhrmann film.

16:28.944 --> 16:32.382
Look, we're two Davids versus
a Babylonian-sized Goliath.

16:32.426 --> 16:35.255
Veronica's clearly prioritized
profit over friendship.

16:35.298 --> 16:38.388
So, I say we do the same
and team up.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.826
Fight fire with fire.
I could apply for
a liquor license

16:41.870 --> 16:43.524
and start serving alcohol,

16:43.567 --> 16:46.353
placing all of my orders
through the Whyte Wyrm,
of course.

16:46.396 --> 16:49.443
And I could install a couple
of slot machines downstairs

16:49.486 --> 16:52.185
and maybe even a craps table.

16:52.228 --> 16:54.317
But what do we do
about live entertainment?

16:54.361 --> 16:56.754
We need an act that will get
people talking and fast.

16:56.798 --> 17:00.236
- What if I resurrect the idea of a singing diner?
- Yeah.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.978
Or I could step it up a notch.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.806
There is an
old tradition that's

17:04.849 --> 17:08.070
due for a Cirque de Soleil-type
re-invention.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.724
What tradition?

17:09.767 --> 17:13.336
- It's a little thing we call the Serpent Dance.
- Oh.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.514
Ms. Lodge.
So sorry to interrupt.

17:17.558 --> 17:20.169
If you're having problems with
the Champagne Suite, Percival,

17:20.213 --> 17:23.085
talk to the building manager.
I don't handle
maintenance issues.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.218
Oh, no, my accommodations
are superb.

17:25.261 --> 17:27.350
I was actually just nipping out
to run an errand,

17:27.394 --> 17:30.527
and I thought I'd pop by
with a proposition.
You see,

17:30.571 --> 17:33.095
the more time I spend
at the Babylonium,

17:33.139 --> 17:35.750
the more this place
feels like home.

17:35.793 --> 17:38.666
And I suppose,
I was just wondering,

17:38.709 --> 17:43.236
if you and I shouldn't explore
a more robust partnership.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.761
In what respect?

17:46.804 --> 17:51.200
Well, I could become an
investor, help take the
Babylonium to the next level.

17:51.244 --> 17:54.812
Only thing is,
I already have a partner.

17:54.856 --> 17:57.728
Oh, yes, Reginald Mantle.

17:57.772 --> 18:01.036
Where is he?
I haven't seen him
since I moved in.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.429
Mantle Motors.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.909
Helping his dad
with the dealership.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.389
Hmm. That sounds right. Um...

18:06.433 --> 18:08.130
Look, I don't mean
to stir trouble,

18:08.174 --> 18:10.263
but you're sure
that's where he is
and what he's doing?

18:12.178 --> 18:13.831
Cut the crap, Percival.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.572
Is there something
you know that that I don't?

18:15.616 --> 18:18.140
No. Do you know what?

18:18.184 --> 18:19.576
I shouldn't say anything else.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.752
You should really
see this for yourself.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.670
What the hell, Reginald?

18:26.714 --> 18:28.672
What are you doing here?

18:28.716 --> 18:30.761
Running a satellite casino
behind my back?

18:30.805 --> 18:34.069
Using slot machines stolen
from the Babylonium?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.462
They're on loan.

18:35.505 --> 18:39.074
This is just... a side hustle.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.990
Another one
in our long history
of side hustles.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.252
We're both benefitting.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.560
How stupid do you think
I am, Reggie?

18:46.603 --> 18:49.258
We're in the fight of our lives
to make the Babylonium solvent,

18:49.302 --> 18:51.260
and you're siphoning
money away from us?

18:51.304 --> 18:54.133
Well, maybe I wanted
something of my own,
where I could call the shots.

18:54.176 --> 18:57.048
So this is about ego, then?

18:57.092 --> 19:00.878
Fine. You know what?
You can keep the slot machines
you "borrowed,"

19:00.922 --> 19:03.359
but as far as I'm concerned,
you're barred from
the Babylonium.

19:03.403 --> 19:06.275
No, you can't do that, Ronnie.

19:06.319 --> 19:07.624
I'm half owner.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.278
Show up and see
what happens, Reggie.

19:11.628 --> 19:14.457
- And you're definitely banished from my bed.
- Hmm.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.900
Well, Dr. Curdle Jr.?

19:24.685 --> 19:27.296
If I'm not mistaken,
what we're looking at here

19:27.340 --> 19:30.821
is the result of a phenomenon
known as SHC.

19:30.865 --> 19:34.347
- Spontaneous Human Combustion?
- Exactly.

19:34.390 --> 19:37.828
Perhaps the gases in this
poor fellow's entrails

19:37.872 --> 19:40.483
heated to such an
intense temperature
that they auto-ignited.

19:40.527 --> 19:43.356
And he burned
from the inside out.
But his feet,

19:43.399 --> 19:46.185
they're still intact.
And the chair
that he was sitting on,

19:46.228 --> 19:49.144
- it was barely singed.
- In cases of SHC,

19:49.188 --> 19:53.366
the fire burns at a temperature
in excess of 1,000 degrees

19:53.409 --> 19:55.846
but is contained
within the body

19:55.890 --> 19:59.198
so that oftentimes,
some of the extremities
are spared.

19:59.241 --> 20:02.505
As well as objects
that are in direct contact
with the victim.

20:03.724 --> 20:07.336
Spontaneous human combustion?

20:07.380 --> 20:09.686
Stranger things have
happened in Riverdale.

20:09.730 --> 20:13.037
My Nana just took
my temperature
and it's rising again.

20:13.081 --> 20:16.606
- Does that mean I'm going to combust too?
- No, no.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.000
- No way.
- How do you know, cousin?

20:21.394 --> 20:26.703
Because I'm going to stay here
tonight and make sure that
that doesn't happen.

20:28.444 --> 20:29.880
Okay.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.553
Hello, Mr. Andrews.

20:50.597 --> 20:54.035
The door was unlocked,
so I slipped in.
I do hope that's all right.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.431
You see that box cutter there?

21:00.694 --> 21:03.349
I'd very much like you
to pick that up.

21:06.917 --> 21:07.831
That's it.

21:12.706 --> 21:15.883
Now, press it into your arm.

21:15.926 --> 21:19.103
I want to see your blood
pooling all over
this lovely floor.

21:19.147 --> 21:20.453
Would you do that for me?

21:25.936 --> 21:26.894
That's it.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.678
Nice and steady now.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.296
That's not possible.

21:40.647 --> 21:43.084
Right. Let's try this again,
shall we?

21:43.127 --> 21:44.564
I don't think so.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.481
You took your shot
and you missed.

22:01.015 --> 22:05.106
I'm sorry
you had to find out about
Reginald's betrayal this way.

22:05.149 --> 22:08.936
If it's any consolation,
I've had a rather frustrating
evening myself.

22:11.591 --> 22:16.030
But isn't it better to know
the truth than to carry on
living blindfolded?

22:18.119 --> 22:19.860
I suppose.

22:19.903 --> 22:24.343
In fact, there is one
other thing I think
you should see.

22:24.386 --> 22:27.520
Tell me, have you been
into the Whyte Wyrm recently?

Oh, my God, Cheryl, you're burning up.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.928
You're literally on fire.

23:27.971 --> 23:29.669
- What's happening to me?
- Uh, let's get you into an ice bath. Okay?

23:29.712 --> 23:31.758
- ASAP. Let's go.
- Okay.

23:31.801 --> 23:35.849
- I'm literally boiling alive!
- Hold on.

23:35.892 --> 23:38.417
The water is pulling the heat
out of your body, okay?

23:38.460 --> 23:42.029
Just ride it out and see
if it dissipates.

23:48.601 --> 23:50.516
Oh, your temperature's
dropping, thank God.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.692
And then what?
It's just gonna keep
building back up in me.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.085
- That's what keeps happening, isn't it?
- That seems to be the pattern.

23:55.129 --> 23:58.654
- Yeah.
- Okay. And we're gonna what? Just go until I die?

23:58.698 --> 24:00.264
What can we even do?

24:00.308 --> 24:04.921
Okay, there is a division
at the FBI that specializes in

24:04.965 --> 24:08.795
phenomenon like this, okay?
I'm going to reach out.

24:08.838 --> 24:11.362
You're not gonna die, Cheryl.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.713
- I swear. Okay?
- Okay.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.759
He was fully in my head.

24:16.803 --> 24:18.674
I thought I was a dead man.

24:18.718 --> 24:21.590
But then I remembered
what you said about
focusing on a tether.

24:21.634 --> 24:24.724
So I zoned in
on this picture of my dad.

24:24.767 --> 24:28.075
- Percival lost his grip on me.
- Okay, that's great. That means the defense actually works.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.903
But, Jug, this is
a temporary solution.

24:29.946 --> 24:32.122
If he catches us
or anyone by surprise,
we're vulnerable.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.602
All right.

24:33.646 --> 24:36.170
Why don't we start after
your big fight with K.O?

24:36.213 --> 24:38.389
You're going to be
riding high off that victory.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.522
The Guinness Book
of World Records is going to
present you with your award,

24:40.566 --> 24:42.393
then we're going
to reveal your statue.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.395
Then you say a couple words
at a press conference.

24:44.439 --> 24:46.615
I mean, the whole town
is going to be rallied
behind you.

24:46.659 --> 24:47.877
Drive him out of town.

24:47.921 --> 24:49.792
- Old school scoundrel-style.
- Exactly.

24:49.836 --> 24:52.012
With everyone cheering
for Riverdale's "Man of Iron."

25:49.330 --> 25:50.636
Quiet on the floor today.

25:51.898 --> 25:53.900
I suppose it's no wonder
since the Chock'lit Shoppe

25:53.943 --> 25:55.945
and the Whyte Wyrm
have declared war on us.

25:57.947 --> 25:58.861
Us?

26:00.733 --> 26:02.561
I'll think of something.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.301
I usually do.

26:04.345 --> 26:06.216
You should show strength.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.175
Teach Tabitha
and Toni a lesson.

26:09.742 --> 26:11.570
Have any suggestions to make?

26:11.613 --> 26:14.573
Oh, always.
I think we should firebomb
the hell out of them.

26:15.835 --> 26:17.053
<i>Pop.</i>

26:18.098 --> 26:20.317
- Is everything okay?
- No.

26:20.361 --> 26:21.754
This is going too far.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.888
I know what you're
trying to do, Tabitha,

26:25.932 --> 26:29.718
but liquor in our
family restaurant?

26:29.762 --> 26:31.807
<i>What's</i> <i>
going on, Toni?</i>

26:31.851 --> 26:35.985
I just got out of jail.
and suddenly you're in
a remake of <i>Showgirls?</i>

26:36.029 --> 26:38.553
I'm all for doing whatever
it takes to make a buck,

26:38.597 --> 26:40.033
and I don't be to be a prude,

26:40.076 --> 26:43.079
but we're in a custody battle
for baby Anthony.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.951
How do you think this looks?

26:47.083 --> 26:49.738
I'm sorry.
What did you just say?

26:49.782 --> 26:53.829
Firebomb Pop's
and the Whyte Wyrm?

26:53.873 --> 26:56.353
I don't know who
you think I am, Percival.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.182
but I'm not my father.

26:59.226 --> 27:03.404
And you,
you're smooth and charming,
but you overplayed your hand.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.362
Now get out of my office

27:05.406 --> 27:08.801
and be grateful that
I'm not throwing you out
of my champagne suite.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.280
As you wish.

27:10.324 --> 27:12.935
I actually have
a pressing engagement to keep.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.024
No rest for the wicked,
it seems.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.641
<i>Marone.</i>

27:24.381 --> 27:26.601
It's like playing cards
in a funeral home.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.342
Lighten the hell up, kid.

27:28.385 --> 27:32.476
You're a free man now,
in complete control of
your own future.

27:32.520 --> 27:37.090
Yeah, well, Veronica
was kind of my future.

27:37.133 --> 27:38.918
The casino, too.

27:38.961 --> 27:41.442
Well, in that case,
maybe you take it back.

27:42.704 --> 27:45.968
The casino, not the girl.

27:46.012 --> 27:49.755
- She was garbage.
- What'd you say?

27:49.798 --> 27:51.582
Shut the hell up,
you disrespectful punk.

27:51.626 --> 27:54.455
You, uh,
want us to deal you in?

27:54.498 --> 27:58.241
And maybe we discuss
deepening our partnership.

28:00.287 --> 28:01.201
Why the hell not?

28:03.159 --> 28:04.683
Atta boy.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.559
Mr. Kelly.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.692
Hi, I was hoping to catch you.

28:13.735 --> 28:16.520
- Do I know you, bud?
- Oh, of course, my name's Percival.

28:16.564 --> 28:19.349
I uh... I caught
a fight of yours
a couple of months ago

28:19.393 --> 28:23.136
at Madison Square Garden.
Title bout against
Hurricane Henry.

28:23.179 --> 28:24.485
Most impressive.

28:24.528 --> 28:27.096
- It's always nice to meet a fan.
- Oh.

28:27.140 --> 28:30.230
- But I gotta hit the hay. Big fight tomorrow.
- Right.

28:31.057 --> 28:32.623
Be well.

28:32.667 --> 28:35.496
Before you dash off,
Mr. Kelly, I um...

28:36.758 --> 28:38.891
I wonder if you might
do me a favor.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.944
Where's K.O?

28:48.988 --> 28:51.120
He just got out of surgery.

28:51.164 --> 28:54.254
- What happened to him?
- Witnesses say that he walked right into traffic.

28:54.297 --> 28:56.865
- Calmly, willingly.
- Oh, my God.

28:56.909 --> 29:00.956
Yeah. Take a guess on who's responsible.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.437
Unbelievable.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.700
Percival, you snake.
We were just talking about you.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.050
Listen, I heard about
your friend K.O.

29:08.094 --> 29:11.097
- Such a shame.
- A shame that he didn't die? Like you wanted him to?

29:11.140 --> 29:13.316
<i>I haven't</i> <i>
the faintest notion what</i> <i>
you're on about, Archie.</i>

29:13.360 --> 29:16.058
But listen,
with K.O. down for the count,

29:16.102 --> 29:20.106
you must be looking for
a new opponent to step into
the ring with you and uh...

29:20.149 --> 29:22.412
Well, I'd like to
throw my hat in,
if that's all right.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.897
Let me tell you, nothing would
make me happier but you do not
want to do that.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.856
Oh, dude, but I do.

29:30.899 --> 29:32.771
Tough as you are,

29:32.814 --> 29:35.382
I was top of my boxing class
at Cambridge and I can
hold my own.

29:35.425 --> 29:39.038
So, how about it?
Me against you in front of
the whole town.

29:39.081 --> 29:40.517
- Winner takes all.
- All right, fine.

29:40.561 --> 29:42.302
But why don't we
up the stakes a little?

29:42.345 --> 29:45.435
When I win, which I will,
you resign from the council.

29:45.479 --> 29:48.438
Agreed. And if I win,
I want you,

29:48.482 --> 29:50.136
<i>personally you,</i>

29:50.179 --> 29:52.138
to reinstate
my great grandfather's
statue in Pickens Park.

29:52.181 --> 29:53.269
- Deal.
- <i>Excellent.</i>

29:53.313 --> 29:54.880
Well, may the best man win, eh?

29:57.926 --> 29:59.885
He wants to fight me.

29:59.928 --> 30:02.061
In the ring?

30:02.104 --> 30:04.846
He's going to try
and mind control you
in front of the whole town?

30:04.890 --> 30:07.022
That's not going to happen.
I'll be thinking about my dad

30:07.066 --> 30:10.069
while I beat him to a pulp
and send his ass out of
Riverdale in a body bag.

30:12.027 --> 30:14.987
Tabitha. Hey,
I was actually just picking up
the phone to call you.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.163
Can we meet?

30:17.685 --> 30:19.034
In person?

30:19.078 --> 30:21.732
Thank you for taking
the time, Agent Drake.

30:21.776 --> 30:25.998
It's my pleasure, Agent Cooper.
I've wanted to meet you
since the Starkweather case.

30:26.041 --> 30:28.478
Well, I'm sorry
that it took so long,

30:28.522 --> 30:31.873
but you said you had some
insight about the case
that I'm working.

30:31.917 --> 30:34.397
Uh, yes.

30:34.441 --> 30:37.836
What you described may not be
spontaneous human combustion.

30:37.879 --> 30:42.971
Despite what your
coroner friend says,
SHC is extremely rare.

30:43.015 --> 30:46.496
Okay, so if it's not SHC,
what is it?

30:46.540 --> 30:51.501
What you described could be
someone who is manifesting
nascent powers of pyrokinesis.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.764
Pyro... Pyrokinesis?

30:53.808 --> 30:56.376
The ability to
create and control fire
with their mind.

30:56.419 --> 31:02.556
And what triggers the onset
of these kinds of abilities?

31:02.599 --> 31:06.038
Pretty much what you'd expect.
Puberty, intense traumas.

31:06.081 --> 31:09.998
And how does
pyrokinesis work, specifically?

31:10.042 --> 31:13.697
We all generate heat. Me, you.

31:13.741 --> 31:17.136
But a pyrokinetic person
generates heat at the level
of a superconductor.

31:17.179 --> 31:19.442
They have to discharge it,
or it will build up

31:19.486 --> 31:21.749
and cause them or anyone
near them to self-immolate

31:21.792 --> 31:25.144
Okay. And...
And how do they
discharge the heat?

31:25.666 --> 31:26.885
Practice.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.627
Want some pointers?

31:31.890 --> 31:33.021
Thanks for stopping by.

31:33.065 --> 31:35.067
And thanks for the partnership.

31:35.110 --> 31:37.678
Thank you.

31:37.721 --> 31:40.420
- And we'll let you know about the slot machines.
- Absolutely.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.424
- Bye.
- Bye.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.563
So,
what were they doing here?

31:53.607 --> 31:57.698
We were reminding
each other of who we are.

31:57.741 --> 31:59.091
Hmm?

31:59.134 --> 32:01.397
Three women and three
proud business owners

32:01.441 --> 32:06.359
in a small town that needs
to come together instead of
letting itself be ripped apart.

32:06.402 --> 32:10.058
We found a way to
thread the needle
and support one another.

32:10.102 --> 32:11.886
How so?

32:11.930 --> 32:14.933
I'm giving two of my
Babylonium slot machines
to the Whyte Wyrm.

32:14.976 --> 32:19.546
and in return, Toni is
giving me ten percent of
what she brings in with them.

32:19.589 --> 32:23.245
As for Tabitha,
we're opening a Pop's booth
in the grand lobby

32:23.289 --> 32:26.596
and splitting the profits
from food sales.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.121
Circles rise together,
after all.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.079
Well, I have to
tip my hat to you.

32:31.123 --> 32:34.430
Very smart how you were
able to handle this
with Tabitha and Toni.

32:34.474 --> 32:37.607
Oh, I wish I could take credit,
but it was Tabitha.

32:37.651 --> 32:41.960
She's the one who came up
with this three-way
partnership and plan.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.919
Yeah. She's very clever,
isn't she?

32:44.963 --> 32:46.051
Yeah.

32:53.493 --> 32:56.452
You're 119 degrees, Cheryl.

32:57.453 --> 32:59.455
Focus on the logs
in the fireplace

32:59.499 --> 33:02.023
and project the heat that's
building up inside onto it.

33:02.067 --> 33:05.070
- How?
- Focus. Visualize it and it will happen.

33:05.113 --> 33:07.246
I'm burning up.
I can't even think straight.

33:07.289 --> 33:09.291
Well, you better get your head
in the game, Cheryl,

33:09.335 --> 33:12.599
because if you don't,
me, you or your Nana
are going to burst into flames.

33:25.046 --> 33:27.222
All right.
Remember your tether.

33:27.266 --> 33:28.702
Couldn't forget if I tried.

33:34.142 --> 33:36.188
All right, fellas,
let's touch 'em.

33:39.147 --> 33:40.366
Good luck.

33:46.894 --> 33:48.026
Go, Archie!

33:57.818 --> 33:59.080
Focus, Archie!

34:02.388 --> 34:04.607
Go on, lower you guard, Archie.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.785
Lower you guard and let me win.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.491
Again, that's not gonna
work on me.

34:18.534 --> 34:21.798
Okay. Looks like
I have to beat you
the old-fashioned way.

34:24.410 --> 34:25.759
Come on, Archie!

34:45.257 --> 34:48.260
One! Two!

34:48.695 --> 34:49.826
Three!

34:50.827 --> 34:51.828
Four!

34:52.916 --> 34:54.135
Five!

34:55.005 --> 34:56.094
Six!

34:56.659 --> 34:57.704
Seven!

35:04.667 --> 35:07.931
- I can't... I can't do it.
- Yes. Yes, you can, Cheryl.

35:07.975 --> 35:11.631
You're... You're phoenix, okay?
You thrive in fire.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.981
Your brother's corpse
was baptized in fire.

35:14.024 --> 35:16.853
Your ancestor, Abigail,
she was consumed in fire.

35:16.897 --> 35:19.682
You burned this house down
and rebuilt it.

35:19.726 --> 35:22.424
You yourself said that
you can control the elements.

35:22.468 --> 35:25.558
Your entire life has been building up to this...

35:25.601 --> 35:28.169
- ...threshold.
- She's at 262 degrees

35:28.213 --> 35:31.259
Damn it, Cheryl!
You are going to die
if you don't do this.

35:31.303 --> 35:32.782
Focus on the logs, okay?

35:32.826 --> 35:34.784
- Stop yelling at me!
- Burn those logs!

35:34.828 --> 35:38.136
- 303 degrees.
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.664
Burn her, Cheryl.
Burn your mother, okay?

35:44.707 --> 35:48.755
Focus. Visualize and make her
pay for all of the pain
that she's caused you, okay?

35:48.798 --> 35:50.496
Set her ass on fire!

36:06.207 --> 36:08.296
You did it, Cheryl.

36:08.340 --> 36:12.561
Great job and congratulations.
You are officially
a pyrokinetic.

36:20.743 --> 36:21.918
Guard, Archie!

36:44.202 --> 36:46.204
- One!
- All right. Stay down!

36:46.247 --> 36:48.075
- Two!
- Stay down! You're done. You're done.

36:48.118 --> 36:49.381
- Three!
- He's slaughtering you, Arch.

36:49.424 --> 36:51.034
- Four!
- You're done!

36:51.078 --> 36:52.558
Five!

36:53.080 --> 36:54.299
Six!

36:55.300 --> 36:56.649
Seven!

38:08.851 --> 38:10.592
Arch.

38:10.636 --> 38:15.380
Hey, Jug,
I just heard about the match.
What happened?

38:15.423 --> 38:16.816
Percival won.

38:17.991 --> 38:19.906
The match, the crowd.

38:21.473 --> 38:23.649
Archie's not going to get
a medal from Guinness.

38:23.692 --> 38:25.303
Percival outplayed us.

38:27.479 --> 38:29.394
Arch, how could you have lost?

38:29.437 --> 38:31.396
I felt Percival's punches.

38:32.222 --> 38:33.789
I felt pain.

38:33.833 --> 38:34.834
I bled.

38:36.488 --> 38:37.880
How could this have happened?

38:37.924 --> 38:40.056
Is it possible Percival
knows about my weakness?

38:40.100 --> 38:42.320
Could he have got ahold
of the palladium?

38:42.363 --> 38:47.368
The only palladium I know of
is what Archie gave to me
to keep safe.

38:47.412 --> 38:48.543
Where is it?

38:50.502 --> 38:53.374
No, no, no, no, no.
There is no way
he could've found it.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.245
Then where is it, Betty?

38:55.289 --> 38:57.117
- I don't know, Archie.
- Percival must know about our secrets.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.598
It's the only way
that he could've beaten Archie.

39:00.381 --> 39:01.643
How does he know?

39:24.274 --> 39:26.668
Thank you, Alice.

39:26.712 --> 39:29.976
Now you get back downstairs
and drink your wine, okay?

39:31.020 --> 39:32.544
Yeah.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.154
That sounds nice.

39:46.079 --> 39:47.602
What?

39:47.646 --> 39:49.561
Your friend, Archie.

39:50.823 --> 39:53.042
There's something
special about him.

39:56.655 --> 39:59.614
You're going to tell me
everything, Betty.

39:59.658 --> 40:02.443
Then you're going to
go back to sleep.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.489
You're going to forget
I was even here.

40:11.191 --> 40:12.453
Archie did it.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.977
The statue is up.

40:15.021 --> 40:16.457
Wow.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.503
A man of his word
to the end, eh?

40:19.765 --> 40:21.201
Fancy a stroll, Tom?

40:56.976 --> 40:58.412
You're so quiet.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.588
What's wrong?
You won the fight.

41:00.632 --> 41:02.155
It's Tabitha Tate.

41:03.112 --> 41:05.288
She weighs on me.

41:05.332 --> 41:07.508
Full of false virtue.

41:07.552 --> 41:12.470
Standing in the way of true
progress with that hideous
diner of hers. It's not right.

41:14.646 --> 41:17.083
I'm afraid to say, gentlemen,

41:17.126 --> 41:21.000
Tabitha Tate's not long for
this new world we're creating.
