WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:09.560
Oh. Peace be with you.
Yeah, you, too. Thank you.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.016
Peace be with you.
- Peace be with you.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.315
And also with you.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.794
Peace be with you.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.336
And also with you.
- Peace be with you.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.360
Peace be with you.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.200
Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.356
Peace be with you.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.400
And also with you.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.954
Let us pray.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.314
Our Father, Who art in Heaven

00:32.159 --> 00:33.230
hallowed be Thy name.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.800
Thy Kingdom come

00:36.120 --> 00:37.600
Thy will be done on Earth

00:38.400 --> 00:39.400
as it is in Heaven.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.798
Give us this day our daily bread

00:42.640 --> 00:44.359
and forgive us our trespasses

00:44.760 --> 00:47.434
as we forgive those
who trespass against us

00:48.560 --> 00:50.677
and lead us not into temptation

00:52.600 --> 00:54.193
but deliver us from evil.

00:56.960 --> 00:57.960
Amen.

01:00.240 --> 01:03.039
<i>♪ Rooted, grafted ♪</i>

01:03.080 --> 01:05.675
<i>♪ Built on Thee ♪</i>

01:06.880 --> 01:07.950
Please be seated.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.395
And also with you.

01:16.840 --> 01:17.840
Um...

01:18.600 --> 01:19.636
Sorry, uh...

01:19.840 --> 01:21.957
Uh, yes, today's, um...

01:24.200 --> 01:25.919
Uh, uh, today's notices.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.351
There's a raffle, um,
at tomorrow's fete

01:29.400 --> 01:31.357
to raise funds for the, uh...

01:31.400 --> 01:33.073
uh, t... uh, excuse...

01:33.120 --> 01:35.874
I'm sorry.
The diocesan pilgrimage to Lourdes.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.038
Uh, congratulations
to St. Ethelred's football club.

01:40.760 --> 01:41.830
3-1 victory.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.958
Uh, next Friday is a First Friday

01:44.000 --> 01:45.878
and I'm going to be making
my usual sick calls

01:45.920 --> 01:48.389
to the housebound
with the Eucharist.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.792
And finally, on Thursday,
I'm going to begin

01:51.840 --> 01:53.797
H-Holy Communion preparation classes.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.355
And there are more details
of that in the parish newsletter

01:56.680 --> 01:58.911
along with my latest review.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.231
That's all, folks.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.069
Uh, please stand for God's blessing.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.496
Thanks so much. All the best.
- Thank you, Father.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.636
Sure. See you next week.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.433
All the best.
- Really good one, Father.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.274
Nice to see you, Gina.
- Loved the story about your eye.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.016
Oh, yes. Stop, stop. Off you go.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.679
Give my regards to those budgies.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.280
Hello.
- Hi.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.876
- This is lovely.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.959
I thought you'd be in prison by now.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.936
Oh, well, I keep trying,
but they just won't have me.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.195
I'm sorry about your eye.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.197
Oh, that's OK.
Gives me some edge.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.512
I've told them some heroic bullshit.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.795
Ah, bless you, Sandy.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.274
Thank you, Father.
- Bless you.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.993
Get well.
- Thank you.

02:37.560 --> 02:38.896
Bye, now. Have a nice day.
- Thank you, bye-bye.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.376
God bless you.
- Bye. See you next week.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.400
Bless you.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.755
I just wanted to, uh

02:43.840 --> 02:44.759
pay you back for dinner.
- Oh, no.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.456
Thank you. Honestly.
- Because I... No, no, really. I insist.

02:46.480 --> 02:47.816
It'll have to be in instalments.
- I don't want it.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.416
I don't want it. I've got no pockets.
- But I really... I just, I...

02:49.440 --> 02:50.874
Honestly, thank you.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.070
OK.
- Ah, ah, ah!

02:52.120 --> 02:53.576
I'm going to knife the candles, Father.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.795
They're a bit clogged up.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.360
OK, Pam.
- Yeah.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.016
Well, the-the hair dryer
is in the, in the wonky drawer.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.793
Under the wonky drawer.
Yes, I know.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.589
Hello, love.
- Hi.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.399
Oh, is that for the collection?
How sweet.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.034
How kind. Thank you.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.080
That's Pam.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.036
Do you like tea?

03:23.800 --> 03:24.800
Jesus.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.840
- Tea.
- Great.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.080
I don't want to boast

03:37.280 --> 03:38.696
but I make a cracking... Oh!

03:38.720 --> 03:40.439
Bastard! Sorry!
- Oh.

03:40.480 --> 03:41.755
Bastard!
- Um...

03:41.800 --> 03:43.951
Let me just,
let me just get this.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.356
OK. Oh, dear.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.635
Oh, is that holy?

03:46.680 --> 03:49.195
A bit less than it was before.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.953
Shit. Uh...

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Oh, well.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.238
He'll understand.
He's an understanding sort.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.000
OK.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.799
There you go.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.515
Sorry about all the tat.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.429
It's for a fund-raiser
garden party thing tomorrow.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.592
So much stuff.
Absolutely no staff.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.438
You can volunteer if you want.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.596
Ah.

04:10.640 --> 04:11.756
I'm only joking.
- Oh.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.437
Probably got a life. Oh.
- Mm.

04:14.920 --> 04:15.839
What's the time?

04:15.840 --> 04:17.320
Um...
- Do you want a proper drink?

04:17.560 --> 04:20.075
I've got cans of G&T from M&S.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.320
Well, it's...
- I will if you will.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.230
OK.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.233
OK.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.040
Yeah.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.836
Thanks.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.880
So, you're a cool priest, are you?

04:42.960 --> 04:44.076
A cool priest?
- Yeah.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.669
No, I'm a big reader with no friends.
Are you a cool person?

04:46.720 --> 04:47.960
Oh, I'm a pretty normal person.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.576
A normal person.
- Yeah, a normal person.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.080
What makes you a normal person?
- Well, I don't believe in God.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.034
I love it when He does that.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.872
So, you were in my prayers last night.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.120
Likewise.

05:10.680 --> 05:11.955
I'm sorry for your loss.

05:12.960 --> 05:13.960
What?

05:14.280 --> 05:15.280
Your baby.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.276
Oh. Yeah, thank you.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.112
Thank you. Yes. I, uh...

05:23.360 --> 05:25.477
I'm... Thank you.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.034
Is the father alright?

05:27.360 --> 05:28.360
Well, he's...

05:28.480 --> 05:29.914
He doesn't really...

05:31.760 --> 05:32.760
exist.

05:34.760 --> 05:35.796
I understand.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.435
The funeral liturgy says

05:41.080 --> 05:44.357
that life is changed, not ended.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.432
I've always loved that,
if that's of any help.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.990
No. Thank you very much,
but I really am an atheist.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.080
Yeah, I gathered that
by the smelling of the Bible.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.999
Oh.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
New sermon?

05:59.240 --> 06:00.856
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
that's, uh...

06:00.880 --> 06:03.839
I-I write,
uh, restaurant reviews

06:03.880 --> 06:05.155
for the parish magazine.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.536
I was just finishing up the last one.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.976
I actually just came up
with a really good title.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Oh, what is it?

06:10.320 --> 06:11.279
No.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.600
What?
- No, it's not cool.

06:12.800 --> 06:13.916
Well, neither are we, so...

06:13.960 --> 06:16.475
"I'd spend 40 days and 40 nights
in that dessert."

06:20.440 --> 06:22.113
Oh, God, I fancy a priest.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.037
There you go. Thanks.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.360
Hey.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.119
Are you having an event?

07:08.640 --> 07:09.640
No.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.560
What?
Why are there so many people here?

07:11.720 --> 07:13.757
Well, it's just successful,
I guess.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.837
Why is everyone talking
to each other?

07:16.240 --> 07:18.118
Oh, it's Chatty Wednesday.
If you buy something

07:18.200 --> 07:19.536
you have to have a chat
with someone you don't know.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.597
What?
- Loneliness pays.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.280
Listen, can we...?

07:24.720 --> 07:25.720
Sure.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.360
I know you and I haven't...
- Have you had a check-up?

07:32.480 --> 07:33.834
Yes. It's-it's fine.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.776
It's really not a big deal.
It happens all the time.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.029
Hello.
- No!

07:37.240 --> 07:38.536
Where are you from?
- I'm-I'm not...

07:38.560 --> 07:40.677
This isn't...
I'm-I'm not part of this.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.037
I shouldn't have to...
I don't want to tell you that.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.232
No. Sorry. No.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.240
Tooting.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.816
She hasn't bought anything yet, Joe.

07:49.840 --> 07:52.116
Oh, shit! I'm so sorry.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.799
I'm sorry.

07:54.800 --> 07:55.870
Does Martin know?

07:55.960 --> 07:57.576
You're not supposed to tell anyone
for the first 12 weeks.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.176
Well, you can tell the father.
- I just haven't told him, OK?

07:59.200 --> 08:01.056
OK, well, what does he know?
- I don't want to talk about it. OK?

08:01.080 --> 08:02.878
And I never want anyone
to know about it.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.600
You have it.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.416
You're better at dealing
with awful things, anyway.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.816
I don't want it.
- Well, you took it

08:07.840 --> 08:09.720
now everyone thinks
you have it, so you have it.

08:17.800 --> 08:18.800
What?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.360
They're some pretty funky trainers.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.914
I said I'm fine.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.536
I just really, really don't want anyone

08:23.560 --> 08:25.392
to make a big deal out of this, OK?

08:25.520 --> 08:27.910
Brutal. Just brutal.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.640
You must feel rotten.
- Mm.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.196
Do you feel rotten?

08:31.400 --> 08:33.376
Um, I'd-I'd rather not talk about it,
if that's OK.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.312
Of course, darling.
Come on up.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.960
Claire, get the door,
for God's sake.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.000
Did you know who the father was?

08:39.039 --> 08:41.509
Um, you know, I'd rather not talk about it,
if that's OK.

08:41.600 --> 08:42.875
No, of course, darling.

08:42.919 --> 08:44.320
Here. Here.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.198
I've got a setup
I'm very excited about.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.799
It's going to be very striking.
- Cool.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.031
So, Claire, if you just sit here.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.273
That's lovely, and, darling.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.589
Mm-hmm.
- Just beside her.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.353
Like that. Lovely.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.200
And actually,
if you could just...

08:58.040 --> 08:59.554
That's it. That's it.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.280
Just a bit.
- Oh.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.073
A bit more. Bit more.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.315
There. Perfect.

09:05.640 --> 09:06.790
Gorgeous. Yes.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.320
Sorry, no.
If you could just...

09:12.040 --> 09:13.315
That's it.
Thank you, darling.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.118
So, um...
- She can't not talk about it.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.198
You know, I have six friends...
- A lie.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.312
...who've had miscarriages.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.360
Five of them never managed
to produce a child afterwards.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.880
But the sixth one did,
and rather regretted it.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.671
So, I think you've probably
done the right thing.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.280
Thank you.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.555
Did you never want them?

09:34.920 --> 09:36.274
Oh, I'm still thinking about it.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.558
Is Dad here?
I texted him, but...

09:39.640 --> 09:41.279
Oh, I saw that.
- Oh, so he is here?

09:41.400 --> 09:42.834
Sorry, no.
I've got his phone today.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.030
I love that colour.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.039
Which one?
- That one.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.476
Oh, that's three colours.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.233
- Right.
- I'm getting rid of it.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.896
But it was quite
an adventure painting.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.240
I had an orgasm as I finished it.

09:57.560 --> 09:58.640
Well, let's hope we all get

09:58.680 --> 10:00.216
as much pleasure out of this one.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.296
No, no. Could you...

10:01.320 --> 10:04.154
Um, I have a pretty full afternoon, so...

10:04.240 --> 10:06.056
Oh, have you got to go back
to Finland again?

10:06.080 --> 10:08.959
No, Finland are coming here.
- Oh. That's easier for you.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.240
Mm.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.016
Are you still OK
to pick up the invitations?

10:12.040 --> 10:13.554
Oh, yes, of course.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.256
And did you find that
ribbon thing for the flowers?

10:15.280 --> 10:16.396
- Yes.
- Great.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.016
And is Martin's nose on the mend?

10:18.040 --> 10:19.040
Yes.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.437
And how's the, uh, bassoon solo coming on?

10:21.520 --> 10:22.776
Oh, yes, he's practising.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.598
Oh, God,
and now I just have to...

10:24.680 --> 10:26.736
- What?
- Sorry, Claire, can you look up, please?

10:26.760 --> 10:27.719
Thank you.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.598
...organise canapés
for an awards ceremony.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.319
Oh, gosh, you must be exhausted.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.553
Does the little cafe do canapés?

10:33.720 --> 10:34.836
It totally could, yeah.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.960
There you are.
That's one off the list.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.200
Great.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.154
Gosh, haven't you got
a lovely, thick neck.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.835
That was fun.
- Thank you.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.816
Yeah, I really can help
with the canapés if it's...

10:51.840 --> 10:54.116
I'm gonna say this quickly. OK.
- OK.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.176
Martin wants to press charges
against you for assault.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.776
I've tried to talk him down,
but to be fair

10:57.800 --> 10:59.837
you did hit him fucking hard.
- What?

10:59.920 --> 11:01.991
I will provide you
with exceptional legal advice

11:02.080 --> 11:03.736
as long as you don't tell anyone
I'm providing you

11:03.760 --> 11:05.274
with exceptional legal advice.
- What?

11:05.440 --> 11:06.440
This is happening.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.320
I am mortified,
but it is happening, OK?

11:09.680 --> 11:11.353
I will hire this lawyer
to scare him off

11:11.440 --> 11:12.960
and I will hire you to do the canapés.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.840
Who's the lawyer?

11:14.960 --> 11:17.111
Oh, he's a friend.
He mainly defends rapists.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.776
He has a high success rate, then?

11:18.800 --> 11:21.190
Oh, undefeated. Come on.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.840
I've filled him in with the basics.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.080
That your husband's an animal?

11:25.160 --> 11:27.152
Be serious.
Just do whatever he says.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.594
And don't flirt with him.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.160
I'm not going to f...

11:32.000 --> 11:33.559
Fucking hell. OK.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.719
Claire.
- David, thank you so much.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.280
Oh. Sorry.
- Wow.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.752
I can take you to court for that.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.440
This the little troublemaker, then?

11:41.680 --> 11:42.680
Hi.
- Hi.

11:42.920 --> 11:46.072
Now, listen, I just want to be clear
that whatever happens

11:46.400 --> 11:48.198
I don't sleep with people I work with, OK?

11:50.080 --> 11:52.914
Ah!

11:53.040 --> 11:54.554
I'm joking.

11:54.760 --> 11:55.830
Slip on in, ladies.

11:56.680 --> 11:57.830
Well, if you spit guilty

11:57.880 --> 12:00.554
you'll have to swallow a short jail term,
or community service

12:00.600 --> 12:02.034
if you're lucky.
- Or?

12:02.080 --> 12:03.594
You definitely started it?
- Yes.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.360
Any witnesses?
- About... 30.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.056
The most important thing, honey,
is that you do not

12:10.080 --> 12:11.878
under any circumstances, apologise.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.316
I can do that.
- No, that's not what we discussed.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.232
Or that can be taken
as an admission of guilt.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.816
I assume you know the victim personally.

12:18.840 --> 12:19.956
Yes, she...
- No and...

12:20.160 --> 12:22.038
let's not call him "the victim" yet,
shall we?

12:22.120 --> 12:24.396
Well, that's what he is.
- Yes. Right.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.269
They've definitely fucked.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.192
We just want a letter to scare him off

12:28.280 --> 12:29.720
if he ends up seeking proper action.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.856
Really doesn't make sense, Claire.
- Actually, maybe not.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.439
I think it makes perfect sense.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.616
I just want to be ahead of the game.
- God, I can't tell.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.233
That's a habit of yours, I've heard.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.800
Oh, I've got it.
- Is it?

12:38.880 --> 12:40.736
They haven't.
- You're gonna have to tell me who said that.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.080
Never.
- But they're going to.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.072
David.
- Oh, God, I've got to get out.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.310
Claire.
- Excuse me.

12:45.720 --> 12:46.896
Where you off to, little lady?

12:46.920 --> 12:49.515
I'm just gonna let this, uh... yeah.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.896
You alright?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.673
Yeah. Just thought I'd leave you to it.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.633
Sorry.
- What?

13:12.920 --> 13:14.856
He says he'll only talk you through
potential proceedings

13:14.880 --> 13:16.656
- if you go for a drink with him.
- What?

13:16.680 --> 13:17.955
I know.
- Outrageous.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.696
Stop smiling.
- I thought he was after you.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.280
Oh, so did I, but my hair
isn't great at the moment.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.034
Either way,
it's very inappropriate.

13:24.440 --> 13:25.680
Don't sleep with him.
- I won't.

13:25.760 --> 13:26.989
Don't.
- I won't!

13:27.080 --> 13:28.639
I don't do that anymore.
- What?

13:29.440 --> 13:31.193
Why? Are you ill?
- No.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.317
Then what?
- Well, I... I...

13:33.880 --> 13:35.997
I just...
- Oh, my God. Have you met someone?

13:36.400 --> 13:39.279
Well... well, not really.
- Back with Harry?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.056
No, it's actually... so, well...
- Someone new?

13:41.080 --> 13:42.719
Is he single?
- Sort of.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.040
Take this.
I'll try talk Martin down

13:48.120 --> 13:50.240
but call him if you need him.
He's a very good lawyer.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.116
Surprisingly...

13:53.320 --> 13:54.800
tender underneath it all.

13:55.440 --> 13:56.440
Knew it.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.880
What you did in the restaurant
was unforgivable.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.480
I know.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.480
Thank you.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.616
OK. Well, I'll, um...
- Listen, I actually

14:06.640 --> 14:08.836
just wanted to give you this.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.960
It's just one session,
but you've been through a lot

14:11.000 --> 14:12.992
so I just...
- Come on. I said I'm fine.

14:14.560 --> 14:15.755
I'm weirdly fine.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.436
I'd rather have the money.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.911
Excuse me.
I've got dry forearms.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.800
Sure.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.920
So why have you come
to this session?

14:44.360 --> 14:46.120
Uh, it was a birthday present
from my father.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.120
Is that a joke?

14:48.680 --> 14:49.680
No.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.640
It would be good
not to make jokes in here

14:53.800 --> 14:55.359
just in case anything gets...

14:56.400 --> 14:58.631
lost in humorous translation.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.600
Oh, I don't know if I can do that.

15:02.600 --> 15:03.600
Is that a joke?

15:03.840 --> 15:04.840
No.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.711
Well, just try not to,
or make it very obvious.

15:10.920 --> 15:11.920
Sure.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.760
So why do you think your father suggested
you come for counselling?

15:15.080 --> 15:17.914
Um, I think because my mother died
and he can't talk about it

15:18.120 --> 15:19.736
and my sister and I
didn't speak for a year

15:19.760 --> 15:21.296
because she thinks I tried
to sleep with her husband

15:21.320 --> 15:23.915
and because I spent most
of my adult life using sex to deflect

15:24.000 --> 15:25.800
from the screaming void
inside my empty heart.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.240
I'm good at this.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.240
Although I don't really do that anymore.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.509
You close with your family?

15:33.960 --> 15:34.960
We get on with it.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.640
Do you talk?

15:36.760 --> 15:37.760
God, no.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.040
Any friends?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Sorry?

15:41.160 --> 15:42.230
Any friends?

15:44.320 --> 15:45.356
Um...

15:45.760 --> 15:47.160
no, I don't really have time for...

15:47.800 --> 15:49.951
Well, I have a guinea pig,
but she blows hot and cold.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.236
Not a joke.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.636
Tell me about the sex.

15:57.920 --> 15:58.920
All of it?

15:59.280 --> 16:00.520
You said you don't do that now.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.480
Oh, no, I just play tennis now.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.080
Tough crowd.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.560
Sorry.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
I just...

16:11.000 --> 16:12.320
Sex didn't bring anything...

16:13.920 --> 16:15.798
...good, so I'm... I'm trying not to...

16:17.600 --> 16:18.600
But I've...

16:18.920 --> 16:20.957
And what have you found
in your abstinence?

16:21.080 --> 16:23.440
Well, I'm very horny,
and you're little scarf isn't helping.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.800
So the impulse is still there.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.790
Oh.

16:30.920 --> 16:31.920
Yeah, the...

16:32.120 --> 16:33.236
The impulse is...

16:33.960 --> 16:36.000
The impulse is v-very much still there.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.280
It's just never the right person.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.596
Mm-hmm.
So there is a particular person

16:41.680 --> 16:42.796
you're not having sex with.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.360
No.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.480
No, well, nothing's happened. I just...

16:47.800 --> 16:48.950
He's not available.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.597
In a relationship?
- Yes. A bad one.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.236
Oh, really? How so?

16:53.680 --> 16:54.976
It's the sort of relationship
where one partner

16:55.000 --> 16:56.160
tells the other how to dress.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.600
Are you in love with him?

16:57.960 --> 16:59.030
No.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.076
Why do you find that funny?

17:02.040 --> 17:03.040
Well, I...

17:03.680 --> 17:04.680
I lied. I just...

17:05.640 --> 17:07.119
I don't kn-know.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.119
Just not a romantic?

17:09.400 --> 17:10.400
No.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Just...

17:12.599 --> 17:14.353
a girl with no friends
and an empty heart?

17:18.319 --> 17:19.549
By your own description.

17:25.520 --> 17:26.520
I have friends.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.393
Oh. So you do have someone to talk to.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.234
Yeah.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.310
Do you see them a lot?

17:35.480 --> 17:36.630
Oh, they're...

17:37.000 --> 17:38.240
They're always there.
They're...

17:39.720 --> 17:41.320
They're always there.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.116
Why do you find that funny?

17:43.560 --> 17:46.056
Listen, I don't need to be analysed.
I have a nice life. I just...

17:46.080 --> 17:48.120
I just wanted to exchange
the voucher for the money.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.389
It's a bit late for that now.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.480
I've only been here five minutes.

17:54.520 --> 17:55.520
I want the money.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.030
I want to fuck a priest.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.434
Catholic?
- Yes.

18:02.760 --> 18:03.910
A good one?
- Yes.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.952
Looks good in the, um...
- Mm, yes.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.320
I understand.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.256
Do you really want to fuck the priest

18:10.280 --> 18:11.600
or do you want to fuck God?

18:12.880 --> 18:14.712
Can you fuck God?
- Oh, yes.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.838
Look, just-just please tell me
how to not fuck a priest

18:18.920 --> 18:19.920
before I get arrested.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.496
Well, I don't think fucking a priest
will make you feel

18:22.520 --> 18:23.840
as powerful as you think it will.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.440
Can you just tell me what to do?

18:25.880 --> 18:26.880
You know.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.856
You already know
what you're going to do.

18:29.880 --> 18:30.880
Everybody does.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.480
What?

18:32.640 --> 18:34.757
You've already decided
what you're going to do.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.960
So what's the point in you?

18:39.920 --> 18:41.240
You know what you're going to do.

18:42.760 --> 18:43.639
No, I don't.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.040
Yes, you do.
- I don't.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.912
You do. You do.
- I don't. I don't!

18:48.880 --> 18:50.200
Good luck.
- Thank you.

18:50.560 --> 18:51.596
Shut up.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.912
Hi, can I have two raffle tickets, please?

18:55.040 --> 18:56.040
Oh, my God.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.360
Oh, my God. Hi.

18:57.480 --> 18:58.800
Hi! You're...

18:59.200 --> 19:01.112
Yeah. Yes.
- With child. Cool.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.953
Yeah, you got a fringe.
- Yeah.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.798
Yeah. Cool.
- Aw. You always wanted a baby.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.399
You always wanted a fringe.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.636
She is amazing.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.359
I mean, it's been tough but amazing.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.510
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.160
I mean, the birth really took its toll.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.416
Oh, really?
Was it a tricky one?

19:14.440 --> 19:15.456
I can't really remember it now.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.712
But the whole thing has just...
really changed me.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.275
I just don't feel...
You know, my emotions

19:21.320 --> 19:24.791
are up and down.
My body just feels different.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.951
I mean, Elaine is being amazing.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.040
So supportive...

19:28.080 --> 19:29.616
Sounds like you have postnatal depression.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.518
I do, yeah, but we're working through it.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.559
Sure.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.136
Just to let you know,
the band is gonna start

19:36.160 --> 19:38.720
in a couple of minutes.
- Hey, Father. This is Suzie.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.393
Oh, I don't know how to talk to babies.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.119
Sorry.
Do you guys know each other?

19:42.680 --> 19:44.480
Well, we sort of used to...
- Uh, yeah, I used

19:44.600 --> 19:46.360
to be her girlfriend.
- ...used to kind of...

19:46.600 --> 19:47.600
Oh, cool.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.200
Good for you.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.736
Well, I'm gonna go
and show her the coconuts.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.195
- She's really good at counting.
- OK.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.198
Excuse me, everyone!

19:57.480 --> 20:00.678
The Youthy Band is about to play
the ode to something!

20:00.760 --> 20:02.194
You having fun?

20:02.240 --> 20:03.594
Yes. Yeah.
- Selling well?

20:03.680 --> 20:05.056
Yes, I think so.
- Good? Oh, a puzzle!

20:05.080 --> 20:06.576
Love a puzzle.
- Father, the-the Youthy Band

20:06.600 --> 20:07.776
are about to...
- Yes, I-I heard you, Pam.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.315
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.316
Oh, there's the main event.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.114
Yeah.
- Very talented.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.237
She, um, sh-she...

20:17.360 --> 20:19.670
don't say it...
she-she actually, uh...

20:19.760 --> 20:20.796
just-just don't say it...

20:20.880 --> 20:22.599
she actually orgasmed
when she finished it.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.713
Just said it. Apparently.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Ah.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.993
Well, whatever gets you there.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.800
Father!

20:33.960 --> 20:36.111
Father, we have
a cupcake situation over here!

20:36.200 --> 20:37.953
OK, Pam!
I will be there to cupcake!

20:39.680 --> 20:41.000
Thank you so much for helping.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.435
Thanks.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.679
Arm touch.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.591
At least my son is in the Youthy Band.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.000
What's your excuse?

21:01.400 --> 21:02.550
I'm helping the priest.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.917
Wow, you do love a challenge, don't you?

21:06.640 --> 21:07.816
Hey, I just want to say something.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.520
It's from River Island.
I got it last week.

21:09.640 --> 21:14.157
No, I want to say that I'm sorry
for saying what I said.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.278
I'm sorry for what you went through.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.800
I'm sorry.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.816
I know what you're doing.
I'm not gonna say it.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.275
I'm just saying sorry.
- I'm not gonna say it.

21:22.600 --> 21:23.600
I'm sorry.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.440
Mm-mm.

21:28.600 --> 21:29.600
OK.

21:30.440 --> 21:31.556
And thank you.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.200
She and I have never been better.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.953
Oh.
- You had a big part in that.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.879
I'm happy for you.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.376
I'm happy you've found a way to deflect

21:39.400 --> 21:44.077
from your pitiful, self-sabotaging,
ego-driven, masturbatory...

21:44.160 --> 21:46.200
I cannot believe how well
this is coming out, pawing

21:46.240 --> 21:50.075
insidious, insidious,
overwhelming mediocrity

21:50.280 --> 21:52.590
only to finally figure out
that at your very core

21:52.760 --> 21:55.639
you are a... w-weaky.

21:56.960 --> 21:57.960
Damn!

21:57.961 --> 22:00.350
A weaky?
- Damn. Damn.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.199
Wow. A weaky.

22:07.920 --> 22:11.357
In that case,
I just wanted you to know

22:11.720 --> 22:15.157
that I'm impressed
with how you just keep bouncing back.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.913
I really am.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.271
You're a... strongy.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.674
That was awesome, man!

22:22.960 --> 22:24.336
Creepy Jake.
Mainly says things like...

22:24.360 --> 22:25.360
Where's Claire?

22:25.400 --> 22:26.754
And...
- Where's Claire?

22:26.880 --> 22:28.160
Well, she couldn't make it, man.

22:28.320 --> 22:31.392
Lucky for us,
your aunt is an avid churchgoer.

22:31.480 --> 22:32.709
Hi. Thanks for watching.

22:32.840 --> 22:33.956
Oh, you were excellent.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.835
Oh.
- Ooh.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.479
Careful there, buddy.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.856
You could go down for that sort
of behaviour these days.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.076
It was just a hug.
- "It was just a hug."

22:43.160 --> 22:44.960
You got to do better
than that these days, boy

22:45.080 --> 22:46.753
especially around this firecracker.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.120
But I didn't do...
- Come on.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.160
I don't want to be an asshole.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.520
I just want her to be happy.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.998
And she has been really happy.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.034
Until she saw you.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.276
Just saying.

23:01.920 --> 23:02.920
Ow.

23:14.600 --> 23:15.795
Psst.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.474
Hi, Jake. Oh.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.600
Tell her to leave him.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.360
What?

23:22.960 --> 23:24.394
Tell her...

23:25.000 --> 23:26.753
to leave him.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.480
He's gonna kill someone one day.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Hey.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.394
Yes, Father. Yes, Father?

23:44.680 --> 23:46.353
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

23:46.480 --> 23:47.480
Oh, God.

23:47.481 --> 23:48.720
...can I get that coconut back?

23:48.880 --> 23:49.950
They're actually on hire.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.696
Uh, I'm not sure if a lot of them

23:51.720 --> 23:53.951
are even real actually,
which is morally a bit dubious.

23:54.040 --> 23:56.350
But we got to make money somehow.
Sorry. Thank you.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.795
Thanks.
- Knuckle brush.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.196
Uh, also...

23:59.280 --> 24:00.953
I hope you don't mind, but, um...

24:02.120 --> 24:03.952
I've marked a few pages in here

24:04.040 --> 24:05.136
that I thought might be...
- Oh, I...

24:06.040 --> 24:07.920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not trying to...

24:08.920 --> 24:10.798
They're just words.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.237
OK, it's just
I-I think I know what happens.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.310
Classic.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.190
Come on, have a read.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.400
I'd like to know what you think.

24:23.760 --> 24:24.989
And if you ever want to...

24:25.920 --> 24:27.434
uh, talk about stuff, I'm here.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.713
With a G&T, of course.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.440
You can come whenever you want.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.640
I'd like you to come.

24:36.360 --> 24:37.360
If it helps.
