a Persian rug,

a creative solution.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.251
- A creative solution
would be a lobotomy

they like nice things.

you're really here.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.482
- So you think Jocelyn's
at the root of this?

04:10.484 --> 04:13.018
- Yeah well, I think obviously
they-they-they-

04:13.020 --> 04:14.720
they had a fight, Moira.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.588
You know, I just don't know
how she puts up with him.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.357
- And now he's living next door.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.725
I've never pretended
to like this motel,

04:19.727 --> 04:21.593
but at least it provided
a buffer between us,

04:21.595 --> 04:24.229
and those people!
- Yeah...

04:24.231 --> 04:25.464
- How long do you think
he'll be here?

04:25.466 --> 04:27.099
- Well, I hate to think.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.401
- Oh God, this is the last
thing we need, John.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.937
We're barely hanging on
as it is!

04:31.939 --> 04:33.472
- Well, what does
that mean, Moira?

04:33.474 --> 04:34.840
"We're barely hanging on?!"

04:34.842 --> 04:36.642
- I mean living in a space
this limited,

04:36.644 --> 04:38.310
is trying enough on a marriage

04:38.312 --> 04:41.380
without having Roland
wallowing next door.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.781
This is going to bring us
to a breaking point!

04:42.783 --> 04:45.817
- Oh Moira, it's not gonna
bring us to the breaking point.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.520
I think we've done an amazing
job since we've been here.

04:48.522 --> 04:51.423
I mean, I barely remember
an argument between us!

04:51.425 --> 04:52.824
- That's my point.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.394
In a room this tiny,
we've just got to ignore

04:55.396 --> 04:57.195
the little irritants
of the other,

04:57.197 --> 05:00.265
or you'd go insane!

05:00.267 --> 05:02.000
- Little irritants? What uh...

05:02.002 --> 05:04.436
What little irritants?
I have little irritants?

05:04.438 --> 05:06.438
- Yes, we all do.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.507
Peccadilloes, cloying habits.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.175
- Like what, for instance?

05:10.177 --> 05:11.743
- All right, John. I...

05:11.745 --> 05:16.114
I drink a little too much
tea sometimes.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.183
- And that's it for you?
You uh...

05:18.185 --> 05:19.718
You drink tea?

05:19.720 --> 05:22.120
- Well, it calms me,
so I suppose you would say

05:22.122 --> 05:25.624
that's because I'm inclined
to get nervous or insecure.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.627
- No, I would say you're
sometimes a little defensive,

05:28.629 --> 05:32.264
and uh, perhaps a tad paranoid.

05:32.266 --> 05:35.133
- That would only be after
you've taken that condescending

05:35.135 --> 05:36.535
father tone with me.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.603
- Father tone?
- There it is.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.372
- You think I have
a father tone?

05:40.374 --> 05:42.607
- John, I wish you could
hear yourself talk.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.576
But of course you never do.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.144
- And that's the other thing
I guess,

05:46.146 --> 05:48.180
I never listen to myself?

05:50.718 --> 05:53.585
Look, it's by not engaging
in this kind of tit-for-tat

05:53.587 --> 05:55.821
that we keep our marriage
afloat.

05:55.823 --> 05:59.691
- And you have no faults,
other than drinking tea?!

05:59.693 --> 06:02.994
- John, I just admitted that
I can get a little defensive.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.197
But only when you act
like a big child!

06:05.199 --> 06:06.765
- I act like a child?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.667
- Yes John, and now is not
the time for you to throw

06:08.669 --> 06:10.469
one of your tantrums!

06:10.471 --> 06:12.504
- Moira, of the two of us,

06:12.506 --> 06:14.873
I'm not the one who throws
tantrums!

06:14.875 --> 06:17.309
- I will not engage.

06:17.311 --> 06:19.711
I do not want to see him
get the better of us.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.747
And I'm sorry, obviously
this has worked you up

06:21.749 --> 06:24.683
into some kind of...
fit of pique.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.153
- Okay, you know what?

06:29.823 --> 06:31.256
I need some air.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.524
- That's another thing
Mr. Rose,

06:32.526 --> 06:34.025
you never finish your fights.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.894

06:46.607 --> 06:49.274

you would know

06:49.276 --> 06:50.609
about affordable housing.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.345
Is this legit?

06:53.347 --> 06:57.082
- Uh... it's an ad for an
apartment.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.084
- I know, it's cute though,
right?

06:59.086 --> 07:01.186
- I wouldn't really describe
any apartment

07:01.188 --> 07:03.088
as cute in this town.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.892
(Door slams)

07:06.894 --> 07:08.393
- Hi...

07:08.395 --> 07:10.695
- Um, hi.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.565
- There's a collection
of undershirts

07:13.567 --> 07:16.435
hang drying outside of my room.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.603
Um, is there any way
they could be removed,

07:18.605 --> 07:21.106
or is there like,
a Texas Chainsaw movie

07:21.108 --> 07:23.341
being filmed out there
that I'm not aware of?

07:23.343 --> 07:25.777
- Actually, Roland is staying
here for a few days.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.546
- Ew.
- That's disgusting.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.881
What's going on over here?
Let me see that.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.551
What is this?

07:32.553 --> 07:36.988
"Charming studio apartment
for rent in lower SC."

07:36.990 --> 07:38.790
What's "lower SC?"

07:38.792 --> 07:41.426
I thought this town
was just one long street.

07:41.428 --> 07:44.229
- I am thinking about
getting a place.

07:44.231 --> 07:47.566
I have some money coming in,
and it's just...

07:47.568 --> 07:49.568
It's not really a cute look
to be this age,

07:49.570 --> 07:52.204
and live at home.
No offense, David.

07:52.206 --> 07:54.439
- Okay, it's not like I have
a lot of say in the matter.

07:54.441 --> 07:55.874
- Okay well, you're a full
grown man,

07:55.876 --> 07:57.709
who's much older than me,
living at home.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.177
So it's just a little bit
embarrassing.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.946
- Hmm, "available immediately."

08:00.948 --> 08:03.782
I wonder if you could
move out tonight?

08:03.784 --> 08:05.584
- Uh no, because I'm gonna be
using my half of the room

08:05.586 --> 08:07.719
as a guest bedroom.

08:07.721 --> 08:10.489
- Ooh, better yet,
you could sublet it.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.823
I'm sure there's plenty
of vagrants

08:11.825 --> 08:13.458
looking for temporary housing.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.560
- Speaking of which, David,
I'm gonna need you to come

08:15.562 --> 08:16.928
and look at the apartment
with me.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.698
- (Imitating Alexis)
Okay, why would I do that?

08:19.700 --> 08:23.301
- Because David, as an
attractive, single female,

08:23.303 --> 08:24.603
I don't feel comfortable
going to look

08:24.605 --> 08:26.905
at an apartment by myself!

08:26.907 --> 08:28.840
- Well, what if the person
who's showing you the apartment

08:28.842 --> 08:31.576
is like, a super cute
single real estate guy?

08:31.578 --> 08:35.514
- That person doesn't exist
in this town.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.148
- Okay, well, if that's
the case,

08:37.150 --> 08:38.650
then David, you have
to come with me.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.152
And if I like the place,

08:41.154 --> 08:43.421
then you can have the whole
motel room to yourself, okay?

08:43.423 --> 08:46.491
- Okay. She's nuts.

08:46.493 --> 08:47.926
Um, if you could...

08:47.928 --> 08:50.962
just figure out the undershirt
situation,

08:50.964 --> 08:53.598
there's just so many of them,
and it's a lot for me.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.333
- Bye!
- You know, for my eyes.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.701

- Oh, Jocelyn. Hi.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.082
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.218
- Really?
- Yes.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.354
- I couldn't help but notice
that you seemed a little...

09:16.356 --> 09:18.089
sad sack-y today.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.725
- Sad sack-y?

09:20.727 --> 09:23.795
Well, maybe that's because
your husband is occupying

09:23.797 --> 09:26.831
the room next to us
at the motel.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.700
- I thought he might
end up there.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.001
That's where we had
our honeymoon.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.703
Had a lot of great times
in that room.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.705
- I don't think
this is one of them.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.840
He was playing
"Don't Cry Out Loud"

09:35.842 --> 09:37.776
loud at two in the morning.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.711
- I'm so sorry. (Laughs)

09:39.713 --> 09:41.880
That's our wedding song.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.848
It was actually the first song
that we ever made--

09:43.850 --> 09:46.685
- Okay, I really don't need
the details on that.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.553
Listen, I would ask you
to sit, but I-I am not--

09:48.555 --> 09:50.021
- Absolutely, yes!

09:53.360 --> 09:55.327
- So...

09:55.329 --> 09:57.629
you two are going through
a little bit of a thing?

09:57.631 --> 09:59.831
- Yeah, we had a tiff, and uh,

09:59.833 --> 10:01.700
I just said, I need some space.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.902
- Well, I'm glad you have
your space,

10:03.904 --> 10:06.304
and I'm glad Roland
has his space,

10:06.306 --> 10:08.640
I'll tell you who's now having
a major problem

10:08.642 --> 10:10.108
with their space.
- Okay, Johnny.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.744
Sometimes it's a lot easier
to blame others

10:12.746 --> 10:14.813
than it is to maybe
kinda turn it inwards

10:14.815 --> 10:17.616
on ourselves, isn't it?

10:17.618 --> 10:19.417
- Meaning...

10:19.419 --> 10:21.086
- Well, it's kinda obvious
that you and Moira

10:21.088 --> 10:23.989
are a little bit rocky
right now.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.157
- No, no, things are not rocky.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.159
Things are not rocky,
and if they are,

10:28.161 --> 10:29.894
it's because your husband
is driving us insane!

10:29.896 --> 10:31.997
- So you're telling me that
there are no issues

10:31.999 --> 10:33.798
between you two right now?

10:33.800 --> 10:37.135
- No! No! No issues.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.972
Well, by "issues,"
if you mean p-peccadilloes,

10:40.974 --> 10:44.175
if you mean little irritants.
- Yeah.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.910
- Maybe.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.013
- Uh-huh.
- But uh no, we're...

10:48.015 --> 10:50.915
- We're good.
- Good.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.889
RAY: Right this way.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.458
As you can see,
it's light and breezy.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.595
And by breezy, I mean there's
a slight but steady draft

11:03.597 --> 11:05.897
I'm told you only notice
in the winter.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.066
- This is so cute for me.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.868
RAY: Oh, and there's a lovely
window here

11:09.870 --> 11:11.603
through which you can see
all of the town.

11:11.605 --> 11:13.738
The cafe, the garage,

11:13.740 --> 11:16.775
a tree of some kind
just uh, over there.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.977
- This is cute, right?

11:18.979 --> 11:21.246
I think this is super cute.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.648
- Wait, is it cute?

11:23.650 --> 11:25.917
Because I know that it's light,
and spacious,

11:25.919 --> 11:27.986
and... airy in here,

11:27.988 --> 11:29.487
but I just wasn't sure
if it was cute.

11:29.489 --> 11:30.922
- Oh, it's cute.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.424
- Are these original moldings?

11:32.426 --> 11:34.259
- Yes, but we can rip those out.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.895
- Okay well, I'm the one that
should be asking the questions.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.563
- Okay, be my guest.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.532
- Okay, so...

11:42.135 --> 11:44.235
When does um...

11:45.806 --> 11:47.872
- Is this a functioning
fireplace?

11:47.874 --> 11:50.508
- Yes, we found an incinerated
squirrel carcass

11:50.510 --> 11:51.943
there last week.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.878
- Ah.
- Um, what are you doing, David?

11:53.880 --> 11:55.680
- You wanted my help,
so I'm helping.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.882
- Mm, okay.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.350
- What's the rent?

11:59.352 --> 12:02.554
- Uh, they want $275,
but I think they're dreaming.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.022
- A week?
- No, no, no, a month.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.057
But again, I think we can
talk them down.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.727
- Wait, $275 a month for this?

12:08.729 --> 12:10.962
That's cheaper than my P.O. box
in New York.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.865
- Do you think I should take it?

12:15.135 --> 12:18.770
- Well, I mean, it is-
it is very old.

12:18.772 --> 12:22.073
- I think that I would like
to see the lease agreement.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.742
- I thought you'd never ask!

12:23.744 --> 12:25.443
(Ray and Alexis laugh)

12:25.445 --> 12:27.278
- Oh, you know, it actually
kind of reminds me

12:27.280 --> 12:28.847
of your old um...

12:28.849 --> 12:31.149
office space that you had
in the West Village.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.084
- Mhmm.
- Remember?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.019
- Yep!
- So cute.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.323
JOCELYN: You know what I think
brought all this on?

12:38.325 --> 12:40.125
That darn election!

12:40.127 --> 12:41.926
It's really hard on couples.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.528
I mean, don't get me wrong,

12:43.530 --> 12:45.497
I really appreciate how
involved Roland wants to be

12:45.499 --> 12:47.866
in my campaign,
it's just that sometimes,

12:47.868 --> 12:49.834
he can be sooo--

12:49.836 --> 12:51.202
- Irritating?
- No.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.371
- Obnoxious?
- I was gonna say sensitive.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.142
- Oh, sensitive.

12:54.168 --> 12:56.541
- Especially when I want
to do something on my own.

12:56.543 --> 13:00.545
Ohhh! Do you really think
he's obnoxious and irritating?

13:00.547 --> 13:03.181
- No! No, no, no,
I was just trying to imagine

13:03.183 --> 13:04.983
what you know, you were
feeling, no.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.185
- Well, I feel frustrated a lot.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.988
You know, you try to have a
rational conversation with him,

13:09.990 --> 13:13.658
and he just gets all like,
stubborn and selfish.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.161
- And then he acts like you're
the one behaving like a child!

13:16.163 --> 13:17.796
- Exactly!
- Right? Yeah, exactly.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.899
Words get-get used,
and twisted around,

13:20.901 --> 13:22.967
and yet, he uses that
against you.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.602
- Yes, that is so Roland!

13:24.604 --> 13:26.938
- And you get the reputation
for being hot-headed,

13:26.940 --> 13:31.342
and he gets to push
every button he can!

13:31.344 --> 13:34.145
- You are so right!

13:34.147 --> 13:37.015
You know, I thought that I
might be ready to forgive him,

13:37.017 --> 13:38.716
but I think he needs
a couple more nights

13:38.718 --> 13:41.052
at that motel.

13:41.054 --> 13:44.088
- But, on the other hand...

13:45.992 --> 13:48.893
maybe it's through
your forgiveness

13:48.895 --> 13:51.262
that you teach him a lesson.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.965
Right, and the sooner
you forgive him,

13:53.967 --> 13:56.201
then the better it's gonna be
for-for you.

Where's Johnny?

14:36.109 --> 14:38.109
- I imagine he's at work.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.613
- Because he seemed pretty
angry this morning.

14:41.615 --> 14:44.182

14:50.056 --> 14:51.823
The only reason John and I
had words

14:51.825 --> 14:54.058
is because we were exhausted,

14:54.060 --> 14:56.160
from being kept up all night!

14:56.162 --> 14:58.796
It seems someone in the motel

I arranged for you

15:07.374 --> 15:09.040

- I think we're a very
courteous guest, Roland,

15:11.211 --> 15:13.177
and have tried to contribute
to this town,

15:13.179 --> 15:15.680
in whatever way we could.

15:15.682 --> 15:19.083
This town, which is quite
frankly, woefully mismanaged.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.319
- Oh, ugh, ew! I hate that!

15:23.723 --> 15:27.325

15:34.901 --> 15:37.135

Hello, everyone!

15:44.744 --> 15:48.179
I'm Moira Rose,
and I know famous people,

15:48.181 --> 15:51.182
so I really can't talk
to the common folk.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.251
Excuse me all, coming through!

15:55.188 --> 15:57.355
- So I'm assuming this place
comes fully furnished?

15:57.357 --> 16:00.191
(Ray laughs)

16:00.193 --> 16:02.327
- No, this is all
completely staged.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.696
- Hmm, it must be very
expensive to furnish

16:04.698 --> 16:06.130
a place like this.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.598
- Not really if you get it
second hand.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.667
Or uh, maybe you get up early
on Tuesdays,

16:09.669 --> 16:13.171
which is garbage day, and find
a discarded couch or sofa.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.139
- Mhmm, um well, you know what,

16:15.141 --> 16:16.708
I don't even really need
that much stuff.

16:16.710 --> 16:20.345

look anyway, so.

in here, Ray,

16:22.148 --> 16:24.749
it's like, alarmingly quiet.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.485
- The apartment was soundproofed
by the previous owner.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.355
But the irony is the people
next door are completely deaf,

16:30.357 --> 16:31.990
so you could literally
scream for hours,

16:31.992 --> 16:33.558
and no one would hear you.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.027
(False scream, laughs)

16:36.029 --> 16:37.762
- Did you hear that?

16:37.764 --> 16:40.798
You could scream for hours,
and no one would hear you.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.166
- Okay well, think about
how much fun that will be

16:42.168 --> 16:44.802
for parties, David.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.938
Um, and what about parking?

16:46.940 --> 16:49.340
- Okay, you don't even
have a car!

16:49.342 --> 16:51.175
- Oh my god, if you want
the place so badly, David,

16:51.177 --> 16:53.244
why don't you just say it?!
- Who says I want it?

16:53.246 --> 16:56.080
- So you don't want it?

16:56.082 --> 16:56.669
- No.

16:56.695 --> 16:58.216
- So if I said that I
didn't want the place,

16:58.218 --> 16:59.684
you wouldn't...
you wouldn't want it?

16:59.686 --> 17:01.219
- Okay, so you don't want
the place?

17:01.221 --> 17:02.487
- Okay, I'm just trying
to figure out

17:02.489 --> 17:04.022
if you want the place!
- Oh, okay, okay.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.257
I think I know what all
the hesitation is about.

17:06.259 --> 17:09.360
Yes, someone did take their own
life in this space,

17:09.362 --> 17:11.229
but the good news is,
we've replaced the ceiling fan,

17:11.231 --> 17:13.231
it's now a break-away model.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.266
And to answer your question,
yes, there is parking.

17:15.268 --> 17:18.102

cats.

on your head!

17:44.464 --> 17:49.167

18:35.982 --> 18:37.548
(Door closes softly)

18:48.294 --> 18:50.428
(Footsteps thud lightly)

18:52.699 --> 18:54.465
- (Sighs)

18:56.669 --> 18:58.936
- John?

18:58.938 --> 19:02.974
- Oh sweetheart, I didn't mean
to wake you.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.042
Don't hear any music next door.

19:05.044 --> 19:07.111
- No, I think he tuckered
himself out.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.514
- Oh, well, that's good,
that's good.

19:09.516 --> 19:13.484
- I suppose he just needed
to spout off for a while.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.420
- Yeah well, Jocelyn will be
glad to hear that.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.489
She just came to pick him up.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.458
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.327
- I think she just needed
some alone time,

19:23.329 --> 19:25.696
you know, to clear her head.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.498
- That's understandable.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.433
- Hmm.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.335
- It's unfortunate they can't
communicate

19:31.337 --> 19:33.905
those needs to each other.

19:33.907 --> 19:37.441
- Yeah well, they don't have
what we have.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.045
- I can't argue with that.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.414
♪ Don't cry out loud ♪

19:45.552 --> 19:49.954
- I thought you said Jocelyn
came back to make up!

19:49.956 --> 19:51.522
- She did!

19:51.524 --> 19:54.292
That happens to be
their wedding song.

20:02.135 --> 20:04.402
(Crickets chirp)

20:05.705 --> 20:09.273
- Just admit that you wanted
the place.

20:09.275 --> 20:10.641
- I was just asking questions

20:10.643 --> 20:12.276
to help you make the right
decision.

20:12.278 --> 20:14.178
- Well, you're a terrible liar,
David.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.947
- It's a pretty good deal,
though.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.182
- Seriously though, would you
wanna live in a house

20:18.184 --> 20:20.117
where someone killed
themselves?

20:20.119 --> 20:21.519
- I can almost guarantee you

20:21.521 --> 20:23.387
that someone's killed
themselves in this room.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.656
- Ew, David!

20:25.658 --> 20:28.426
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.095
Ugh!

20:36.536 --> 20:39.470
- You know, sometimes at night,
I see things.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.240
- Oh my God, David!

20:42.242 --> 20:43.708
- Yeah, yeah. Like...

20:45.078 --> 20:47.178
dark things.

20:47.180 --> 20:50.381
Like sometimes there's this old
woman that paces back and forth

20:50.383 --> 20:54.018
by your bed, waving her hands
over your face.

20:56.055 --> 20:58.789
I don't think her bony fingers
ever touch your mouth, though.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.592
- (Gasps) Mom?

21:01.594 --> 21:04.662
- Do you ever wake up
with chapped lips?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.697
- Dad!

21:06.699 --> 21:08.332
- Dad's dead.

21:08.334 --> 21:11.469
- Ohh, you're such a dick,
David!

21:11.471 --> 21:13.738
- (Groaning, choking noise)

21:17.310 --> 21:19.410
- Stop!
