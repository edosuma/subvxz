00:00.028 --> 00:01.540
Lucifer
stole Jack's grace.

00:01.541 --> 00:03.776
I know this must be
so hard without your grace,

00:03.777 --> 00:04.810
but you can get past this.

00:07.830 --> 00:08.830
Jack?!

00:10.367 --> 00:11.783
Lily Sunder.

00:11.785 --> 00:14.486
She was a professor
of Apocalyptic Literature.

00:14.488 --> 00:16.655
All my life,
I dreamed about angels.

00:16.657 --> 00:18.006
I had a life,

00:18.008 --> 00:19.791
a wonderful life.

00:19.793 --> 00:21.826
They took everything from me.

00:21.828 --> 00:25.547
No!

00:25.549 --> 00:28.383
Ishim said you made
some kind of pact,

00:28.385 --> 00:29.968
that you're using
dark magic.

00:29.970 --> 00:31.303
I use their magic.

00:31.643 --> 00:33.643
Every time I use
one of their spells,

00:33.645 --> 00:36.729
a piece of my soul burns away.

00:36.731 --> 00:38.314
It's all right, Jack.

00:38.316 --> 00:39.682
Jack, hey, we're
right here, buddy.

00:39.684 --> 00:41.017
He's in good hands.
Don't worry.

00:41.019 --> 00:43.019
Jack's in total
systemic failure.

00:43.021 --> 00:45.354
His body's in the process
of shutting down.

00:45.356 --> 00:47.189
When Jack's grace
was taken from him,

00:47.191 --> 00:49.158
his being fell into chaos.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.828
The -- The cells
are gobbling each other up.

00:51.830 --> 00:53.362
Jack is part archangel.

00:53.364 --> 00:55.415
He needs
a much stronger force

00:55.417 --> 00:57.884
and probably
some kind of magic,

00:57.886 --> 01:00.536
and he needs it quick.

01:02.340 --> 01:03.673
- Jack.
- Jack!

01:04.876 --> 01:05.842
So, what can we do?

01:05.844 --> 01:06.843
Watch over him.

01:06.845 --> 01:08.394
Stay by his side...

01:08.396 --> 01:10.179
as he dies.

01:19.858 --> 01:21.357
Hey, hey, hey,
it's all right.

01:21.359 --> 01:22.692
Take -- Take it easy.
Take it easy.

01:22.694 --> 01:23.910
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:29.084 --> 01:31.734
Please don't be sad.

01:31.736 --> 01:37.123
Maybe -- Maybe this is how
things are supposed to be.

01:38.426 --> 01:41.627
Don't give me that
"meant to be" crap.

01:41.629 --> 01:43.296
This isn't part
of some damn plan.

01:43.298 --> 01:44.430
Dean...

02:12.911 --> 02:14.160
Can you tell him...

02:14.162 --> 02:18.614
it's okay?

02:18.616 --> 02:20.967
Tell him yourself.

02:20.969 --> 02:23.002
He'll be back in a minute.

02:25.507 --> 02:27.140
Sam...

02:28.760 --> 02:32.461
...what happens next...

02:32.463 --> 02:34.981
for someone like me?

02:36.851 --> 02:38.651
I don't know.

02:42.774 --> 02:45.441
Then it's gonna be
an adventure.

02:57.005 --> 02:58.621
Dean.

02:59.841 --> 03:01.707
I can't.

03:05.329 --> 03:06.712
It's not right,
Cass, you know?

03:06.714 --> 03:08.497
It's just -- It's not --

03:08.499 --> 03:10.133
What?

03:10.135 --> 03:11.768
It's not fair?

03:13.221 --> 03:14.854
I know that.

03:14.856 --> 03:16.973
But he needs you.

03:32.407 --> 03:33.990
He's gone.

Maybe we should...start
thinking about next steps.

04:16.067 --> 04:20.253
Wake and a bonfire,
Hunter style.

04:20.255 --> 04:22.371
It's what Jack would've wanted.

04:24.242 --> 04:29.045
Sam,
your brother's in pain.

04:29.047 --> 04:31.797
Just let him be.

04:31.799 --> 04:34.267
If he needs his space,
we're gonna give it to him.

Hey, Mom, it's me.

04:50.601 --> 04:55.621
Sorry to lay this
on your voicemail, but, uh...

04:55.623 --> 04:56.906
it's Jack.

04:56.908 --> 04:58.491
He...

04:58.493 --> 05:02.444
He got sick, um,

05:02.446 --> 05:05.081
and he, uh -- h-he died...

05:05.083 --> 05:07.133
this morning.

05:07.135 --> 05:09.285
I would have called you sooner,
but, um, it --

05:09.287 --> 05:12.454
it happened so fast.

05:12.456 --> 05:17.293
And we thought we could fix it,
you know like always.

05:17.295 --> 05:19.645
Anyway, Mom, I'm sorry.

05:19.647 --> 05:23.799
I know how much he meant to you
and, uh, to all of us.

05:23.801 --> 05:26.018
Anyway,
to tell you the truth,

05:26.020 --> 05:28.304
it would really be nice
to hear your voice.

05:28.306 --> 05:30.606
If you could, uh,
just call us back.

06:04.525 --> 06:07.109
Hey, you seen Sam?

06:13.651 --> 06:15.517
How could you just
let him leave, man?

06:15.519 --> 06:17.570
You saw what he was like.

06:17.572 --> 06:19.322
Dean, you said
to give him space.

06:19.324 --> 06:24.210
Yeah, space, in the bunker,
with <i>us,</i> not <i>this.</i>

06:24.212 --> 06:25.711
Dean, look.

06:39.043 --> 06:40.726
Tell me
you didn't make a deal.

06:40.728 --> 06:42.728
A -- A -- A deal? What?

06:42.730 --> 06:43.779
No.

06:43.781 --> 06:46.048
I --

06:46.050 --> 06:48.734
I was trying
to build a pyre.

07:23.938 --> 07:28.924
I couldn't -- I-I couldn't
even do that for him.

07:30.594 --> 07:33.279
I should've done more.

07:33.281 --> 07:34.814
- Sam --
- I should have tried harder.

07:34.816 --> 07:37.450
You know, I mean,
everything we got --

07:37.452 --> 07:40.403
the spells, the lore --

07:40.405 --> 07:43.072
what good is any of it
if we couldn't even save him?

07:43.074 --> 07:45.207
At least you were
there for him.

07:47.778 --> 07:51.414
This doesn't feel right.

07:51.416 --> 07:54.967
It's just not how I thought
Jack's story would end.

07:56.421 --> 08:00.306
Yeah. None of us did.

08:00.308 --> 08:04.260
The certainty...of death,

08:04.262 --> 08:06.429
even for angels,
it's always felt natural,

08:06.431 --> 08:09.265
but this doesn't.

08:11.018 --> 08:14.487
Jack being taken
before his time.

08:14.489 --> 08:16.822
I mean, taken before me.

08:19.310 --> 08:21.160
So, what do we do?

08:21.162 --> 08:22.778
Say goodbye...

08:24.782 --> 08:27.333

10:18.596 --> 10:22.231
wherever you are.

10:27.771 --> 10:29.455
Jack, take it easy.

10:29.457 --> 10:31.574
You don't have to cram it
all in at once, right?

10:31.576 --> 10:32.908
Still no signal.

10:32.910 --> 10:35.411
Yeah, 'cause I told you,
that app blows.

10:35.413 --> 10:36.996
I found this
in the glove compartment.

10:36.998 --> 10:39.131
Ah! Old school!

10:39.133 --> 10:40.583
A real map.

10:40.585 --> 10:42.251
Let's find our way
to Dodge City.

10:42.253 --> 10:45.087
C'mere, Jack. I'm gonna
teach you how to read a map.

10:45.089 --> 10:48.424
So, rule number one --
rule number one --

10:48.426 --> 10:49.425
rule number one --

10:49.427 --> 10:50.459
Dean?

10:50.461 --> 10:52.428
North is usually up.

10:58.636 --> 11:01.604
Something's wrong.

11:39.882 --> 11:43.584
Man, haven't seen
this stuff in years.

11:43.586 --> 11:46.553
And what language
is this technically in?

11:46.555 --> 11:48.088
We're not sure, but it's --

11:48.090 --> 11:49.390
it's written in cuneiform.

11:49.392 --> 11:51.341
Kevin was very thorough.

11:51.343 --> 11:54.378
Yeah. We kept it all --
the translations,

11:54.380 --> 11:56.180
his notes on his translations,
annotations.

11:56.182 --> 11:57.347
You name it.

11:57.349 --> 12:00.084
Ohh. Whoa, ohh.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.785
Is this it?

12:01.787 --> 12:04.555
Uh, yeah,
this is everything.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.756
You think it's possible?

12:05.758 --> 12:06.857
I think so. Maybe.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.659
Maybe what?

12:10.262 --> 12:11.762
Hello, Dean.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.698
Dean,
you remember Lily Sunder.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.732
L--

12:19.105 --> 12:20.471
You got old.

12:20.473 --> 12:23.073
Did I?

12:23.075 --> 12:27.911
An unfortunate side effect
of giving up magic, I suppose.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.747
Ah.
What are you doing here?

12:30.749 --> 12:33.250
- I called her.
- You --

12:36.055 --> 12:38.122
Okay. Last thing
I remember

12:38.124 --> 12:41.091
was her killing
a whole bunch of angels

12:41.093 --> 12:42.326
to get revenge
for her daughter.

12:42.328 --> 12:43.594
She tried to kill you.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.395
- Yeah. I remember.
- That's not --

12:45.397 --> 12:47.664
Dean, listen, last night,

12:47.666 --> 12:51.068
after about whiskey number five,
it hit me.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.403
I mean,
we've torn through all the lore

12:53.405 --> 12:55.305
looking for a way
to cure Jack, right?

12:55.307 --> 12:57.274
But we've never looked through

12:57.276 --> 12:59.276
Kevin's angel tablet
translations.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.445
Yeah,
'cause they're worthless.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.647
I mean, Kevin translated
them into --

13:03.649 --> 13:06.667
to crazy scribble
only a prophet can read.

13:06.669 --> 13:10.620
And last I checked, we can't
exactly ask Donatello.

13:10.622 --> 13:13.640
Maybe I can read them.

13:13.642 --> 13:14.975
Oh, so, what,
now you're a prophet?

13:14.977 --> 13:16.810
She's the next
best thing.

13:16.812 --> 13:19.296
I mean, Lily is an angel expert
who tapped into their magic

13:19.298 --> 13:21.265
in ways we didn't even
know existed.

13:21.267 --> 13:22.683
So, if she can read
the translations,

13:22.685 --> 13:24.467
then maybe we can
pull off a miracle.

13:24.469 --> 13:26.520
What kind of miracle?

13:26.522 --> 13:30.023
A way to bring Jack home.

13:30.025 --> 13:32.776
Okay. Go for it.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.168
So, can you read --

13:41.170 --> 13:42.419
Shh!

13:48.677 --> 13:50.177
I'm sorry. I can't.

13:50.179 --> 13:52.379
Oh. All right.
Well, thanks for stopping by.

13:52.381 --> 13:54.681
Wait.

13:54.683 --> 13:55.966
You can use my magic.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.467
Your magic?

13:57.469 --> 14:00.137
The magic I used,
as you so sensitively put it,

14:00.139 --> 14:02.639
to get revenge
for my daughter.

14:02.641 --> 14:06.026
You said your nephilim boy --
Jack --

14:06.028 --> 14:09.646
without his angel grace,
his human body died?

14:09.648 --> 14:13.350
My magic draws power
from the soul, the human soul.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.517
It could save him.

14:14.519 --> 14:16.236
You'd give your soul up?

14:16.238 --> 14:18.521
Not <i>my</i> soul.
<i>His.</i>

14:18.523 --> 14:20.073
Pass.

14:20.075 --> 14:23.493
It's not his entire soul,
obviously.

14:23.495 --> 14:25.662
How much of it?

14:25.664 --> 14:27.748
As long
as he's only using it

14:27.750 --> 14:30.500
to sustain his body,
it won't cost much.

14:30.502 --> 14:31.585
He'll never miss it.

14:31.587 --> 14:33.253
What are we even
talking about?

14:33.255 --> 14:36.206
I-It's too late.
Jack's dead.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.008
His soul's gone, right?

14:38.010 --> 14:40.928
Maybe not.
If Jack is in Heaven,

14:40.930 --> 14:44.765
I might be able to pull
his soul into his body.

14:44.767 --> 14:48.235
It would only be
for a few seconds.

14:48.237 --> 14:49.686
That's all the time
I need.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.438
If I can open the door,

14:51.440 --> 14:56.726
your boy can use my magic
to stay alive.

14:56.728 --> 14:58.862
Resurrection and a cure.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.698
You're welcome.

15:01.700 --> 15:04.251
And you would do
all this for us, huh?

15:04.253 --> 15:07.454
Eh, for what? Out of
the kindness of your heart?

15:07.456 --> 15:09.739
No. But I'm willing
to trade.

15:09.741 --> 15:10.924
Trade for what?

15:10.926 --> 15:13.543
I'm old, and I'm dying.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.912
And when my life is over,

15:15.914 --> 15:18.915
I'm pretty certain
I'm going to Hell.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.884
Why is that?

15:20.886 --> 15:23.253
Well, I murdered
a lot of angels.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.923
I don't expect them
to welcome me with open arms.

15:26.925 --> 15:30.861
So, if you want my help...

15:32.097 --> 15:34.197
...get me into Heaven.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.102
We're talking about
that kid's soul.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.237
Not all of it.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.488
Oh, okay, then.

15:41.490 --> 15:43.106
Tell me you're
not cool with this.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.941
Don't you think Jack should
decide for himself?

15:44.943 --> 15:47.628
Listen, I know
how important a soul is.

15:47.630 --> 15:49.413
Believe me. I do.

15:49.415 --> 15:50.964
But if we have a shot at saving
him and bringing him --

15:50.966 --> 15:53.917
Look, if we do this --
<i>if</i> --

15:53.919 --> 15:56.286
how are we supposed to
get her upstairs, hmm?

15:56.288 --> 15:58.088
What, do we talk to Death?
Billie?

15:58.090 --> 15:59.589
Kidnap a reaper?

15:59.591 --> 16:02.426
Death is powerful,
but she and her reapers --

16:02.428 --> 16:04.794
they don't decide
who goes up or who goes down.

16:04.796 --> 16:05.896
Then who does?

16:07.299 --> 16:09.933
Anubis.
Guardian of the Dead.

16:09.935 --> 16:12.802
The Ancient Egyptians
believed that when you die,

16:12.804 --> 16:15.638
Anubis would weigh your heart
on his scale

16:15.640 --> 16:17.307
against justice's feather.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.692
Yeah, the -- the weighing
of the heart ceremony, right,

16:18.694 --> 16:19.809
but that wasn't Anubis.

16:19.811 --> 16:21.328
That was Osiris.
We met him.

16:21.330 --> 16:22.312
Major dick.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.997
Osiris is Anubis's father,

16:23.999 --> 16:25.815
and Heaven passed over him
when they enlisted his son.

16:25.817 --> 16:27.701
Anubis works for Heaven?

16:27.703 --> 16:29.319
He doesn't work <i>for</i> Heaven.
He works <i>with</i> Heaven.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.321
When God left --
sorry, long story --

16:31.323 --> 16:32.655
we needed a new judge,

16:32.657 --> 16:34.824
and Anubis was
the obvious choice.

16:34.826 --> 16:36.293
So, Heaven hired a temp

16:36.295 --> 16:37.827
to make sure the soul trains
kept running on time?

16:37.829 --> 16:39.880
Right. Great.
So, we summon him.

16:39.882 --> 16:41.798
You can do that?
You can summon a god?

16:41.800 --> 16:44.468
Done it before.

16:49.808 --> 16:51.841
Here, boy! Here, boy!

16:51.843 --> 16:52.842
Go long!

17:00.903 --> 17:04.538
Roosevelt!

17:21.839 --> 17:23.873
Who are you?

17:23.875 --> 17:26.009
I'm Jack.

17:28.897 --> 17:31.732
I'm your son.

17:38.607 --> 17:40.524
My...

17:42.694 --> 17:45.562
Jack.

17:45.564 --> 17:46.780
It's you.

17:50.285 --> 17:52.369
Oh.

17:52.371 --> 17:55.622
I don't understand.

17:55.624 --> 17:58.074
You were just a baby.

17:58.076 --> 17:59.742
I-I grew up.

18:01.764 --> 18:04.297
Do you know
where you are?

18:04.299 --> 18:06.082
Uh...

18:07.419 --> 18:08.935
Roosevelt?

18:08.937 --> 18:12.305
He was hit by a car
when I was in high school.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.258
How in the world...

18:15.260 --> 18:18.311
You're in Heaven.

18:18.313 --> 18:20.947
You're in your memories,

18:20.949 --> 18:24.434
your best,
best memories because...

18:24.436 --> 18:27.270
I died.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.239
The day you were born.

18:34.079 --> 18:37.297
Why are you...

18:42.954 --> 18:45.955
No.

18:45.957 --> 18:47.290
No, no, no.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.308
Baby, no, no.

18:48.310 --> 18:49.643
Castiel -- he was --

18:49.645 --> 18:51.094
he was supposed to
take care of you.

18:51.096 --> 18:52.295
And he did.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.315
He and --
and Sam and Dean --

18:55.317 --> 18:57.501
they tried their best.

18:59.137 --> 19:01.004
But things didn't go
as planned.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.709
That's why I had to see
if you were okay.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.811
Jack, what's wrong?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.998
All right, Lily
should be done in a second.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.652
She's writing instructions for
Jack so he'll know how to, uh...

19:15.654 --> 19:19.039
Use the soul-sucking magic?
Boy, that lady's a peach.

19:19.041 --> 19:21.208
- Listen, we talked about this.
- I know.

19:21.210 --> 19:24.294
Gotta happen.
It's the only way. Right.

19:24.296 --> 19:25.629
But I don't like
rollin' the dice

19:25.631 --> 19:27.497
on the word
of a psycho ex-angel killer.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.300
I don't love it, either,
but taking risks,

19:30.302 --> 19:32.168
making crappy deals --
that's what we do.

19:32.170 --> 19:33.470
Yeah, and they usually
bite us in the ass.

19:33.472 --> 19:34.721
So, what do you
want to do about it?

19:34.723 --> 19:36.339
Leave Jack in the morgue?
Burn him?

19:36.341 --> 19:37.691
I didn't say that.

19:37.693 --> 19:39.226
Because, for me,
not doing this -- that --

19:39.228 --> 19:41.478
that would be like letting him
die all over again.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.146
I want Jack back,
too, okay?

19:43.148 --> 19:44.514
I do.

19:44.516 --> 19:45.982
I just don't trust Lily.

19:49.905 --> 19:50.987
You got a 20 on Jack?

19:50.989 --> 19:52.372
Not exactly.

19:52.374 --> 19:56.493
Angel radio is playing
a distress signal.

19:56.495 --> 19:57.744
Awesome.

19:57.746 --> 19:59.028
All of Heaven's gates
are open,

19:59.030 --> 20:00.863
even the ones
that Metatron closed.

20:00.865 --> 20:02.031
What could that mean?

20:02.033 --> 20:04.534
I don't know,
but it's not good.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.386
More awesome.

20:06.388 --> 20:09.222
All right, well, you go.
We got Lily.

20:09.224 --> 20:10.840
When we're ready,
we'll pray.

20:27.726 --> 20:31.894
The instruction manual.

20:31.896 --> 20:34.030
Thanks.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.082
All right,
we're almost set.

20:36.084 --> 20:37.117
Just got to get
one more thing.

20:37.119 --> 20:39.252
I'm gonna go grab it.

20:40.205 --> 20:41.922
Hey.

20:54.252 --> 20:56.937
You know, maybe we
got off to a bad start.

20:56.939 --> 20:59.922
Um, guess I should be
thanking you.

20:59.924 --> 21:02.192
Apology accepted.

21:04.813 --> 21:08.097
Except something's
been bothering me.

21:08.099 --> 21:09.932
Uh, you know,

21:09.934 --> 21:14.287
if this magic of yours
is so great...

21:14.289 --> 21:16.790
why'd you stop using it?

21:19.661 --> 21:21.628
You're letting yourself
get old.

21:23.948 --> 21:27.283
You're letting yourself
die.

21:27.285 --> 21:28.835
Why?

21:28.837 --> 21:31.504
Why risk going to Hell
if you don't have to?

21:31.506 --> 21:33.923
There's something
you're not tellin' us.

21:36.511 --> 21:39.763
When Ishim
took my daughter,

21:39.765 --> 21:42.599
I swore I'd kill him,

21:42.601 --> 21:47.320
even if it meant
burning my entire soul.

21:47.322 --> 21:49.155
But it didn't.

21:50.692 --> 21:55.144
I have a sliver,
a whisper of my soul left.

21:55.146 --> 21:57.030
And?

21:57.032 --> 21:59.482
May --

21:59.484 --> 22:01.534
my daughter,
my little girl --

22:01.536 --> 22:03.152
is in Heaven.

22:03.154 --> 22:04.654
And if there is still

22:04.656 --> 22:06.673
a piece of my soul...

22:08.794 --> 22:11.795
Now do you understand?

22:13.832 --> 22:15.432
Hello?

22:17.335 --> 22:19.302
Hello?

22:35.604 --> 22:37.071
Zuriel.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.281
Dumah.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.283
Castiel.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.335
What happened?

22:51.337 --> 22:52.636
I don't know.

22:52.638 --> 22:55.673
We were just -- Sorry.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.511
That stuff --
when it touched me,

23:00.513 --> 23:02.897
everything
just went black.

23:04.684 --> 23:07.268
I thought you were
supposed to be on Earth.

23:07.270 --> 23:09.487
I'm looking for someone.

23:11.357 --> 23:13.307
Jack.

23:13.309 --> 23:16.143
I have to find him.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.661
Don't leave me.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.449
Can you walk?

23:22.785 --> 23:25.169
Dumah.

23:39.001 --> 23:41.469
It's cold.

23:41.471 --> 23:43.354
He's not here.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.358
Hello, Castiel, Dumah.

23:48.561 --> 23:49.894
Jack's gone.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.145
How is that possible?

23:51.147 --> 23:52.513
Perhaps the angel
side of him

23:52.515 --> 23:54.348
knew he was in Heaven.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.733
In any case, he left.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.651
Naomi,
what is happening here?

23:57.653 --> 23:59.904
We're under attack.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.656
It stormed the gates.
It defeated our defenses.

24:02.658 --> 24:04.992
There are so few of us left,
we couldn't even stop it.

24:04.994 --> 24:07.027
It? What --
What do you mean by "it"?

24:07.029 --> 24:10.197
The shadow, the thing
that rules the Empty.

24:10.199 --> 24:13.250
I'm surprised you didn't
recognize its handiwork,

24:13.252 --> 24:14.535
Castiel.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.337
I thought
you were old friends.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.723
What is this place?

24:19.725 --> 24:22.259
<i>Nothing but Empty.</i>

24:22.261 --> 24:25.596
<i>Angels and demons, you all</i>
<i>come here when you die.</i>

24:25.598 --> 24:27.097
How did you know?

24:27.099 --> 24:30.351
You're the only one of us
who ever escaped.

24:30.353 --> 24:32.019
What does it want?

24:32.021 --> 24:33.854
The boy.

24:33.856 --> 24:36.524
The Empty considers
Jack its property.

24:36.526 --> 24:38.359
And who knows?
Maybe it's right.

24:38.361 --> 24:39.893
He is half-angel.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.228
So, what do we do?

24:41.230 --> 24:42.246
Give it what it wants.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.564
You're joking.

24:43.566 --> 24:46.250
Tell me --
what choice do we have?

24:46.252 --> 24:48.702
If we don't meet its demands,
Heaven will fall.

24:48.704 --> 24:54.174
46,750,000,000 human souls
will be cast in the wind.

24:55.795 --> 24:58.546
What's one nephilim boy
against all that?

25:01.384 --> 25:03.417
You know I'm right,
Castiel.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.636
This is what we have to do.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.972
Help me.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.479
No.
Castiel --

25:17.316 --> 25:18.432
Naomi?

25:18.434 --> 25:21.118
Castiel, run!

25:21.120 --> 25:24.455
Ya 'anubays,
yda 'uwzuris.

25:24.457 --> 25:26.773
Astamae 'iilaa suti.iel, run!

25:26.775 --> 25:30.744
Ya 'Anubis,
'ant min yazan alqulbu.

25:30.746 --> 25:33.797
Astamae 'iilaa suti.

25:33.799 --> 25:37.084
Ya 'Anubis,
dalil almawtaa.

25:37.086 --> 25:41.505
Aleawalim bayn
alealamin maftuhatan,

25:41.507 --> 25:44.124
wa'amrak 'an tuqadim

25:44.126 --> 25:47.027
nafsak fi eini.

25:50.166 --> 25:52.032
Give it a second.

25:59.842 --> 26:02.610
Mm.
The brothers Winchester.

26:02.612 --> 26:05.179
I must say, your files have
come across my desk many times.

26:05.181 --> 26:06.981
We never met?
I mean, we've died.

26:06.983 --> 26:08.515
Yeah. A lot.

26:08.517 --> 26:10.117
I'm more of a "back of
the house" kind of guy.

26:10.119 --> 26:12.486
Death and her subordinates
get all the face time.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.154
I get stuck with
the paperwork.

26:14.156 --> 26:15.956
Pushin' pencils,
damning souls.

26:15.958 --> 26:16.991
Tough work.

26:18.494 --> 26:21.795
Just as snappy
as advertised.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.797
What do you want?

26:23.799 --> 26:25.232
It's me.

26:25.234 --> 26:27.568
I need to know where
I'm going when I die.

26:27.570 --> 26:29.903
Hmm.

26:29.905 --> 26:32.172
That's unorthodox.

26:32.174 --> 26:35.075
Against protocol.

26:37.313 --> 26:39.647
But I suppose
we're already here.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.185
An abacus?

26:45.187 --> 26:47.705
You were expecting
a scale and a feather?

26:47.707 --> 26:49.239
May I?

27:10.229 --> 27:11.345
I'm sorry.

27:11.347 --> 27:12.596
No.

27:12.598 --> 27:14.381
Change it.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.882
I can't.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.234
Well, looks like
you're not goin' anywhere.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.885
Yeah. The lore
was pretty clear --

27:18.887 --> 27:21.905
Anubis can be bound in
a ring of foinikélaio.

27:21.907 --> 27:24.692
Aka palm oil.

27:24.694 --> 27:26.944
Just so happens
we had some laying around.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.562
This is a miscalculation.

27:28.564 --> 27:31.248
Fine. Then change it.
Let her into Heaven.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.117
I'm an accountant.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.451
I don't have
that kind of power.

27:34.453 --> 27:35.753
Yeah, right.
Like you or --

27:35.755 --> 27:37.037
or God has never
made an exception?

27:37.039 --> 27:38.205
That's right.

27:38.207 --> 27:40.124
Because <i>God</i> doesn't decide.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.291
<i>I</i> don't decide.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.794
<i>You</i> do, each of you,

27:43.796 --> 27:46.296
your individual choices
all tallied up

27:46.298 --> 27:47.931
at the precise moment
of your death.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.389
Keep me here.

27:55.391 --> 27:57.090
Try and kill me.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.309
It is not going to change
Lily Sunder's fate.

28:00.730 --> 28:02.896
But it might change yours.

28:12.408 --> 28:14.575
Smart boy.

28:30.426 --> 28:32.793
You're sure?

28:32.795 --> 28:35.596
I know him.

28:35.598 --> 28:38.015
He's here.

28:43.773 --> 28:45.189
See anything?

28:45.191 --> 28:47.658
Whatever comes through
that door,

28:47.660 --> 28:49.576
I'll distract it
so you can run.

28:51.947 --> 28:54.815
I'm not going anywhere.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.149
Jack?

28:56.151 --> 28:57.501
Cass?

29:17.473 --> 29:19.389
Hello, Castiel.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.642
Kelly.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.148
I'm so sorry.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.854
I failed you.

29:33.856 --> 29:35.038
You didn't.

29:36.709 --> 29:38.024
You didn't.

29:38.026 --> 29:42.913
Jack -- he's wonderful.

29:42.915 --> 29:45.332
Yeah.

29:45.334 --> 29:48.502
We've been getting
to know each other.

29:48.504 --> 29:50.036
What are you doing here?

29:50.038 --> 29:54.007
Sam and Dean and I -- we
found a way to bring you home.

29:55.511 --> 29:59.346
So, I'll be alive again?

29:59.348 --> 30:03.233
Yeah. But to do so,
we -- we need to use magic

30:03.235 --> 30:04.902
that will draw
on your soul.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.069
W-What do you mean,
my soul?

30:06.071 --> 30:07.721
It'll be just
a small piece.

30:07.723 --> 30:10.774
And I know it's too much to
ask, but it's the only way.

30:10.776 --> 30:12.192
No. I-I don't know.

30:12.194 --> 30:15.946
It's not just Jack's life
that's at stake.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.114
It --

30:17.116 --> 30:19.917
The Empty
has invaded Heaven

30:19.919 --> 30:22.786
because it wants you.

30:22.788 --> 30:24.371
Why him?

30:24.373 --> 30:25.906
Because Jack
is half-angel,

30:25.908 --> 30:28.375
and we angels -- when we die,
we go to another place.

30:28.377 --> 30:32.212
It's a place that's
just endless nothing.

30:32.214 --> 30:34.414
And this entity --

30:34.416 --> 30:36.082
it won't stop
until it finds you,

30:36.084 --> 30:39.136
but if you're not here,
if you're alive...

30:39.138 --> 30:40.754
Then it'll leave Heaven.

30:40.756 --> 30:43.273
Smart.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.775
Dumah.

30:45.728 --> 30:47.895
Try again.

31:08.478 --> 31:09.911
Lily, I --
I know you're upset,

31:09.913 --> 31:12.647
but you can still
do the spell.

31:13.816 --> 31:16.918
That wasn't the deal.

31:16.920 --> 31:18.286
I've got to go.

31:18.288 --> 31:19.587
We have nothing
to offer you, noth--

31:19.589 --> 31:21.088
nothing to say, but...

31:21.090 --> 31:23.257
He's <i>our</i> kid!

31:23.259 --> 31:25.009
I'm sorry.

31:26.479 --> 31:28.346
You know what I think?

31:29.966 --> 31:33.801
Burning all that soul?

31:33.803 --> 31:36.437
You're not even human
anymore, not really.

31:36.439 --> 31:37.638
Dean --

31:37.640 --> 31:40.408
Otherwise,
how could you ever,

31:40.410 --> 31:45.997
ever let anyone go through
what you went through?

31:45.999 --> 31:48.165
The pain of losing a kid?

31:48.167 --> 31:50.534
Don't do this to us.

31:55.157 --> 31:56.791
You're the Empty.

31:56.793 --> 31:58.876
Pretty good, huh?

31:58.878 --> 32:00.160
You ready to go?

32:00.162 --> 32:01.996
You stay away from him.

32:03.132 --> 32:04.715
Castiel,
you know how this goes --

32:04.717 --> 32:06.851
the good souls here,
the bad souls there.

32:06.853 --> 32:09.220
The angels are mine.

32:09.222 --> 32:11.022
Enough.
Stop interrupting!

32:13.676 --> 32:15.192
Start paying attention.

32:17.313 --> 32:18.863
I'm taking him.

32:20.516 --> 32:24.568
And where I'm taking you
is worse than Hell...

32:24.570 --> 32:27.154
because at least Hell
is something.

32:28.708 --> 32:29.857
Ohh.

32:29.859 --> 32:32.359
Ohh, God,
they look scared.

32:33.663 --> 32:35.880
Does that hurt you?

32:39.385 --> 32:41.085
Good...

32:41.087 --> 32:43.170
because I want it to.

32:46.926 --> 32:47.892
Ugh!

33:11.617 --> 33:13.701
I'm ready.

33:16.456 --> 33:18.122
No!

33:18.124 --> 33:19.540
Stop!

33:19.542 --> 33:21.459
Oh!

33:22.595 --> 33:24.912
Cass,
I hope you can hear me.

33:24.914 --> 33:26.263
We've got Jack.

33:26.265 --> 33:27.932
His shell --
it's ready to go.

33:27.934 --> 33:30.084
Here's hoping that you're
staring at him right now.

33:30.086 --> 33:34.305
So, if you are, then, uh,
do your thing, okay?

33:34.307 --> 33:35.890
Amen.

33:39.112 --> 33:42.396
Oh-doh oh oh-zah-zuhm-ah,

33:42.398 --> 33:45.232
oh-ee, ah-oh-ee-vee...

33:56.662 --> 33:58.913
Take me.

33:58.915 --> 34:00.664
A little louder,
please.

34:00.666 --> 34:02.967
Take me in his stead.

34:02.969 --> 34:05.753
Take me.

34:05.755 --> 34:07.788
You?

34:07.790 --> 34:10.641
I'm the one you want.
I'm the one who woke you up.

34:18.150 --> 34:19.516
You?

34:21.487 --> 34:24.155
But you're
already mine.

34:24.157 --> 34:26.023
Not for years...

34:26.025 --> 34:29.827
eons maybe.

34:29.829 --> 34:31.161
But if you'll agree,
I will go now,

34:31.164 --> 34:33.614
and I will go willingly.

34:37.870 --> 34:39.503
Deal.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.824
Oh, but not now.

34:43.826 --> 34:45.993
No, no, no, no, no.

34:45.995 --> 34:48.829
No, you see,
I-I meant what I said.

34:48.831 --> 34:52.016
I-I want you to suffer.

34:54.003 --> 34:57.337
I want you to go back to --
to your normal life

34:57.339 --> 34:59.056
and -- and then forget
about this and forget about me.

34:59.058 --> 35:00.357
And -- And then,
when you finally

35:00.359 --> 35:02.476
give yourself permission
to be happy

35:02.478 --> 35:05.846
and let the sun shine
on your face,

35:05.848 --> 35:09.533
that's when I'll come.

35:09.535 --> 35:13.370
That's when I'll come
to drag you to nothing.

35:16.075 --> 35:18.075
I accept.

35:35.094 --> 35:37.394
Where am I?

35:37.396 --> 35:40.431
Easy. It's all right.

35:45.571 --> 35:48.388
Why?
Why did you do that?

35:48.390 --> 35:50.908
Because I made a promise.

35:52.862 --> 35:55.913
Because I love you, Jack.

35:57.399 --> 35:59.200
And Sam and Dean --
they love you.

35:59.202 --> 36:02.453
And they are fighting for you
at this very minute.

36:02.455 --> 36:04.872
Oh oh. Oh-doh...

36:04.874 --> 36:06.707
I hope that...

36:09.078 --> 36:12.379
They don't need to know
what happened here.

36:12.381 --> 36:16.217
What I did -- I'm -- I'm --
I'm at peace with my choice.

36:17.386 --> 36:19.053
I don't want them
to worry.

36:22.758 --> 36:24.558
I won't tell them.

36:27.563 --> 36:29.730
I promise.

36:29.732 --> 36:32.399
Then we should go.

36:40.576 --> 36:42.276
We didn't get
enough time.

36:42.278 --> 36:45.079
Shh. It's okay.

36:45.081 --> 36:46.780
Go.

36:46.782 --> 36:49.950
Have a great life.

36:49.952 --> 36:52.419
I'll be waiting.

36:57.927 --> 37:01.011
I love you so much.

37:14.026 --> 37:15.609
You ready?

37:42.148 --> 37:43.781
Jack.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.066
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

37:45.068 --> 37:46.818
Read this.
Jack, read this.

37:46.820 --> 37:50.788
Oh, koh-nuh-ga-ma-
fuh-luh-guh,

37:50.790 --> 37:52.740
ah-oh-ee-vee-ah-ee...

37:52.742 --> 37:54.242
...ee-duh-luh-vah...

37:54.244 --> 37:56.411
oh-ee-vee-ah-ee,

37:56.413 --> 37:58.279
ee-duh-luh-vah-juh-ah-um

37:58.281 --> 38:01.749
kah-dah.

38:11.077 --> 38:12.910
Was that my soul?

38:12.912 --> 38:14.379
How do you feel?

38:15.415 --> 38:16.464
Good.

38:16.466 --> 38:19.384
I feel...good.

38:25.025 --> 38:26.474
It's good to have
you back.

38:27.777 --> 38:28.893
Lily, thank you.

38:28.895 --> 38:32.230
Yeah. Lily --

38:36.319 --> 38:37.785
Lily?

39:01.428 --> 39:04.662
I don't understand.
Why am I here?

39:04.664 --> 39:07.098
Hm.

39:13.139 --> 39:15.973
Care to try
your luck again?

39:41.017 --> 39:42.717
I'm curious.

39:42.719 --> 39:45.136
Did you know what doing
the spell would cost you?

39:49.642 --> 39:51.893
Say hello to
your daughter for me.

40:00.236 --> 40:02.653
Hello, Castiel.

40:04.574 --> 40:06.407
Relax.

40:08.361 --> 40:09.794
I'm here to thank you.

40:12.048 --> 40:13.748
What you did --

40:13.750 --> 40:17.552
I know it wasn't
for our benefit...

40:17.554 --> 40:19.387
but you saved us.

40:23.560 --> 40:26.260
You're welcome.

40:26.262 --> 40:29.764
I think that deserves
a reward, don't you?

40:31.267 --> 40:33.384
Like, for example,

40:33.386 --> 40:36.187
the archangel Michael's
location.

40:37.557 --> 40:39.407
You know where he is?

40:39.409 --> 40:41.725
We have an idea.

40:41.727 --> 40:44.529
And word is,
you've been looking for him.

41:01.798 --> 41:04.215
Is, uh, something wrong?

41:04.217 --> 41:06.434
No.

41:06.436 --> 41:08.586
No, not at all.

41:08.588 --> 41:09.887
Just damn glad
to have you back.

41:09.889 --> 41:10.888
Yeah.

41:12.425 --> 41:15.226
And we know
where Michael is.

41:15.228 --> 41:17.228
Not quite sure how
you pulled that one off.

41:19.065 --> 41:20.648
Well, we, uh --

41:20.650 --> 41:24.435
we still don't know where
Dark Kaia is or the spear.

41:24.437 --> 41:26.988
Yeah, but we will.
We'll figure it out.

41:26.990 --> 41:28.990
We'll find her.
I mean, we found her before.

41:28.992 --> 41:30.825
That's right.

41:30.827 --> 41:32.493
And then Michael --

41:32.495 --> 41:34.662
and that son of a bitch
is gonna pay.

41:36.416 --> 41:37.615
Come on.
