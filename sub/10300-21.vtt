01:03.730 --> 01:05.933
- Daddy, do I have to watch this?
- Yes, you do.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.035
As your father, when I find
something of quality...

01:08.235 --> 01:10.671
...I feel it's my responsibility
that my child reap the benefits.

01:10.871 --> 01:11.872
TV is not all trash.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.176
And now, back to Psycho Dad.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.447
A little touched
Or so we're told

01:20.647 --> 01:23.317
He killed his wife
Because she had a cold

01:23.517 --> 01:25.752
- Might as well, she was getting old
- Getting old

01:26.320 --> 01:29.189
Psycho Dad
Psycho Dad

01:29.389 --> 01:30.691
Psycho Dad

01:30.891 --> 01:34.928
He's quick with a gun
And his job ain't done

01:35.128 --> 01:39.032
Killed three wives by 21
He's Psycho Dad

01:40.100 --> 01:42.970
This is why we must give to PBS.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.039
Oh, I'm so sick.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.116
Can someone get me some water?

01:56.717 --> 01:59.052
You know where the kitchen is.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.921
Or maybe you don't.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.958
Daddy, she is sick. She needs help.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.395
Mom, the kitchen's over there
somewhere.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.432
All right, fine. Be that way.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.801
But I hope you realize,
the longer I stay sick...

02:14.968 --> 02:17.538
...the longer it'll be before
I do any housework around here.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.540
Oh, gee, Peg.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.475
But we can still have sex, can't we?

02:26.413 --> 02:29.449
Mom, Dad, Grandma.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.786
A weird thing happened to me
at school.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.622
My English teacher, Miss McGowen,
she was looking at me.

02:37.524 --> 02:40.494
She looked right at you?
Is she all right?

02:42.563 --> 02:45.199
Listen, Craftmatic Adjustable Girl...

02:46.667 --> 02:47.701
...I know the look.

02:47.935 --> 02:51.505
I get it plenty as I parade
the total package around town.

02:51.705 --> 02:55.509
It's the look that says, "You've got
it all and I want a piece of it."

02:55.742 --> 02:58.278
I've seen that look a thousand times
on a thousand faces.

02:58.478 --> 03:00.214
And I saw it again today.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.852
I'm not kidding. It was desire.
Desire, I tell you.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.855
Well, the great thing is that
you're at your sexual peak.

03:08.055 --> 03:10.757
This is it, Bud. "She looked at me."

03:10.958 --> 03:14.027
Yeah, that was the top of the hill.
The supreme moment.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.797
Something to tell your cats about
when you're 60.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.634
You know, when you think they're
looking at you, but they only want food.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.171
You know, this is almost too sad
to spread around the mall.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.139
Yep, almost.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.244
It is possible she looked at me.
Isn't it, Dad?

03:30.444 --> 03:32.813
Bud, didn't I take you to Little League
when you were 8?

03:33.013 --> 03:35.215
- Yes.
- Then what do you want from me?

03:36.783 --> 03:39.820
See, I told you he wouldn't
have a date.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.156
- Now go ahead and ask him.
- All right.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.827
Hey, we're on our way
to Chuck E. Cheese...

03:48.462 --> 03:50.164
...and we'd be honoured
if you'd go with us.

03:50.364 --> 03:53.000
We don't want you to think that we're
taking you somewhere out of pity.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.769
- It's really a happening place, right?
- Oh, yeah. As the kids say:

03:55.969 --> 03:59.072
"It's uptight, out of sight,
and everything'll be all right!"

03:59.339 --> 04:01.975
You can pretend it's your birthday
and we'll get you a Chuck E. Ducky.

04:02.176 --> 04:04.244
It makes bath time fun.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.515
What does it look like I am,
the kid in Mask?

04:08.782 --> 04:10.184
I am popular.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.286
You get that, people? Popular.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.288
Now can I get a
"Whoa, Bud is popular"?

04:14.855 --> 04:17.357
How about a "Whoa, shoot the boy"?

04:18.625 --> 04:21.028
I see. Well, get a load of this.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.697
Today at school, a teacher was
looking at me like I was breakfast.

04:23.897 --> 04:28.068
- What do you think of that, D'Arcy?
- I think that deserves an extra topping.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.005
She was looking at me.
She was, she was.

04:32.472 --> 04:35.442
She was looking at me
like Mrs. D'Arcy used to look at me.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.080
You mean like this?

04:42.983 --> 04:45.519
Well, yeah, but it was even more
bold with desire.

04:45.752 --> 04:48.822
All right, a commercial's on now,
I guess I have to get into this.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.125
What are you people trying to do,
ruin my boy's confidence?

04:52.326 --> 04:56.029
Now, if he says a teacher looked at
him, I say a teacher looked at him.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.265
Son, was this a female teacher?

04:59.700 --> 05:01.268
Yes, Dad.

05:02.236 --> 05:04.805
- Seriously?
- Yes.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.240
All right, then, let's celebrate.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.742
You sit right down here
and you watch TV.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.011
Listen, is that Chuck E. Cheese
place good?

05:11.245 --> 05:14.348
We were only going to do it for the boy
because he was alone on Friday night.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.849
Well, I'm alone on Friday night too.

05:16.049 --> 05:19.920
Well, gee, Al, it's too bad that the
Hair Club for Men isn't a real club, eh?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.756
Take me to Chuck E. Cheese.
You were gonna take Bud.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.391
Don't make me beg. Come on.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.928
Well, Bud, I guess
it's just you and me.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.763
My boy and his sick mother...

05:29.963 --> 05:31.532
...who nursed you
when you were a baby...

05:31.732 --> 05:35.235
...who fed you and nurtured you
and now all she asks for in return...

05:35.435 --> 05:38.672
...is some soup from Jerry's
and a burger from Don's...

05:38.872 --> 05:40.707
...and a meatball hero
from Tratatorio's...

05:40.908 --> 05:43.343
...and a snow cone from Izzi's
at the airport.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.445
Mom, it's Friday night.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.182
Oh, my mama

05:48.382 --> 05:51.652
To me she was so beautiful

05:51.852 --> 05:54.855
Oh, my mama

05:55.322 --> 05:57.691
- Okay, okay, I'll go.
- That's a good boy.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.259
Get me some tampons too.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.200
Of course.

06:08.602 --> 06:12.072
Gee, Buck, no one loves you
when you're sick.

06:12.306 --> 06:14.208
Come give Mommy a kiss.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.751
Coming next fall, Psycho Mom.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.323
Who's that gal who needs no man

06:29.523 --> 06:31.992
Killed him dead with a frying pan

06:32.192 --> 06:34.595
Did it 'cause he missed the can

06:34.795 --> 06:37.531
Psycho Mom
Psycho Mom

06:37.731 --> 06:39.666
She's Psycho Mom

06:40.434 --> 06:43.237
- On Fox.
- Naturally.

06:44.938 --> 06:48.275
And your next quiz will be on
the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe.

06:48.475 --> 06:52.112
She may not be looking at me now,
but she was too looking at me.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.447
I just know it.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.883
And why not?
Lots of girls look at me.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.620
I know she's looking at me.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.999
Maybe everybody was right.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.201
Why would Miss McGowen
look at me?

07:14.401 --> 07:15.836
Who cares? She's 40.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.838
What would I want
with a 40-year-old woman?

07:21.642 --> 07:23.243
I want that.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.980
I want that bad.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.317
Class dismissed.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.921
Except for you, Mr. Bundy.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.622
What could this be?

07:35.822 --> 07:38.559
I hope she didn't notice me
staring obsessively at her legs.

07:38.759 --> 07:43.096
Mr. Bundy, I've noticed you during
class staring obsessively at my legs.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.667
Well, at least she didn't catch me
looking at other things.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.702
And other things.

07:49.736 --> 07:50.938
Gulp.

07:51.171 --> 07:55.375
Your behaviour, Mr. Bundy,
has finally forced me to take action.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.979
I understand, Miss McGowen.
Do what you must.

08:18.966 --> 08:22.669
Aspirin. Honey, give me
an aspirin before I die.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.038
Why me?

08:26.073 --> 08:28.442
What about the old guy
who lives in your room?

08:29.309 --> 08:32.212
Well, if you mean Daddy,
he's at Chuck E. Cheese.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.815
He's been there
every night this week.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.616
Since he discovered
that the pizza's free...

08:36.817 --> 08:40.120
...if he just pretends to be with
whatever kid's having a birthday party.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.259
Well, I guess I have to start walking
a little bit prouder now, eh?

08:45.492 --> 08:48.061
- Give Mommy some aspirin, honey.
- Sure, Mommy.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.932
Hey, Bud, get Mom some aspirin.
Everyone else has a date.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.637
No, Kel, everyone has a date.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.014
Is it hot in here or is it just me?

09:09.183 --> 09:12.553
He's in a suit.
Is there a funeral at school today?

09:12.786 --> 09:16.256
Yes, 'tis the death of Bud Bundy,
Ionely boy...

09:16.456 --> 09:19.426
...and the birth of Stud Bundy,
only boy.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.764
I have a date.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.834
A date? Holy Hannah.

09:29.102 --> 09:32.306
Hello, Reverend Felcher?
Has hell frozen over?

09:33.674 --> 09:35.042
Well, something's up.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.911
My brother has a date. Yes, Bud.

09:39.513 --> 09:41.715
I know. I know church is
the place to be at times like this.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.050
I'm coming right over.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.486
Now, you're the building with
the big T on top, right?

09:50.891 --> 09:54.528
- Daddy, the sky is falling.
- It would. Just when I start eating.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.298
Peg, look at this.
Look what I won playing Skee-Ball.

09:58.499 --> 10:00.868
Actually, I was a couple tickets short
so I copped a few...

10:01.068 --> 10:03.537
...from a kid in a stroller
who was too young to tell on me.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.174
Yeah, he can point and cry,
but let's see that hold up in court.

10:07.608 --> 10:10.244
- Son, you gotta come with me.
- Sorry, Dad, I can't...

10:10.444 --> 10:12.713
...because I have two things
you don't have: A date...

10:12.913 --> 10:14.848
...and an ounce of pride.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.287
Son, if you had an ounce of pride...

10:20.487 --> 10:22.422
...you wouldn't lie to us
about having a date.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.261
That must be her now.
A half hour early, I might add.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.829
Well, who can blame her?

10:29.029 --> 10:31.398
Sometimes I can't wait
to touch myself either.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.505
Well, you know what I mean.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.041
I'm afraid we do.

10:45.812 --> 10:46.813
Darlene?

10:50.584 --> 10:54.688
I shall now leave you to your
tissue-and cheese-infested lives.

10:56.657 --> 10:59.359
Word is you've been dating
Miss McGowen.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.095
Yeah, well, I'd hate to deny her this.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.066
Well, what about me?

11:06.266 --> 11:07.935
I mean, I'd like to see you too.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.704
Why? I mean, sure.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.673
- Why?
- Well, I can't help but think...

11:12.873 --> 11:16.777
...you must be quite a lover
if an older woman wants you.

11:17.411 --> 11:20.514
Yeah, well, Miss McGowen...
Dotty and I.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.316
- We have this exclusive thing,
you know...

11:22.516 --> 11:24.418
..."Be true to your schoolmarm"
and all that.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.861
But then, I guess the old lady
can wait for half an hour.

11:40.634 --> 11:42.236
What are you doing?

11:43.670 --> 11:46.106
Little Andy Goldstein's
having a birthday.

11:48.675 --> 11:51.745
Box is empty, but by the time
he finds out, I'll be full and gone.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.985
- Don't you care at all that I'm sick?
- Well, of course I do, honey.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.621
How do you want me to prove it?
You want me to swim a river?

12:00.821 --> 12:03.824
- Climb a mountain? Slay a dragon?
- Bring me an aspirin.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.093
Can't do it, babe.
Gotta go to Chuck E. Cheese.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.428
And that's another thing, Al.

12:08.629 --> 12:11.465
I am tired of you coming to bed
smelling of extra cheese.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.634
I can't believe no one cares.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.335
And now with Bud going out
every night...

12:15.536 --> 12:17.504
...there's never anyone here
to take care of me.

12:17.738 --> 12:18.739
Oh, come on, Peg.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.008
Go on upstairs
and I'll bring you some juice.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.344
This time for real?

12:24.578 --> 12:25.879
Just as soon as you're in bed.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.220
- Well, I'm trusting you.
- You won't be disappointed.

12:37.691 --> 12:39.660
And if you are, I won't be here.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.032
Bud, listen, your mother says
she needs some juice...

12:45.232 --> 12:46.834
...or an aspirin
or something real bad.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.670
- Dad, I'm too tired.
- No pressure. Do it tomorrow.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.576
I'm going out again tomorrow.
In fact, I'm going out again tonight.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.110
- Dad, I need to talk to you.
- Son...

12:57.311 --> 12:59.613
...you know I got
the Goldstein affair tonight.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.682
It'll only take a minute.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.984
I've been seeing two women
at once. It's wearing me out.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.586
I don't know how to juggle
two women.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.087
Did you ever have this problem?

13:07.321 --> 13:09.556
You're talking to old number 33.

13:10.057 --> 13:11.725
You know how I got that number?

13:11.925 --> 13:14.628
Because the most money
you've ever had was 33 cents?

13:15.329 --> 13:18.365
No! Because that's how many
women deep the line was...

13:18.565 --> 13:20.834
...to ride the wild Bundy.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.938
Back in those days,
everybody wanted a piece.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.640
I had anyone to choose from.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.448
But we don't always choose
what's best for us.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.151
And this two-women-juggling thing:

13:37.351 --> 13:39.786
Eventually, the problem is
they both fall down on you.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.122
So save yourself some pain
and pick one.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.958
- What if I pick the wrong one?
- Oh, you will.

13:45.626 --> 13:48.295
No matter who you pick,
it'll be the wrong one.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.465
And not just because you're a Bundy,
because you're a man.

13:51.665 --> 13:54.134
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've gotta get to the party...

13:54.334 --> 13:56.403
...before fat Billy Applebaum
eats all my pizza.

13:58.438 --> 14:01.842
He comes to every one of those
damn parties. All us kids hate him.

14:02.543 --> 14:05.646
Dad, did I mention one of these women
was 40 and my teacher?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.252
No, you did not.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.154
I think she loves me, Dad.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.424
Son, I say this not to hurt,
but to educate.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.661
You see, son, I'm afraid
it may not be you she's after.

14:20.861 --> 14:24.264
I'm afraid she might be after
the vast Bundy fortune.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.700
She wants everything we have!

14:27.434 --> 14:30.304
Dad, I've seen the trunk of her car.
She's got everything we have.

14:31.205 --> 14:32.372
It's still not right.

14:32.573 --> 14:35.943
Son, you got plenty of time to date
40-year-old women when you're 70.

14:36.143 --> 14:39.146
No, wait, wait a minute.
Make that 35 when you're 80.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.582
Yeah, that feels more right to me.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.951
Yep, that's what I want when I'm old:

14:44.151 --> 14:47.588
A drool nurse with luscious honkers
wiping my chin...

14:47.788 --> 14:51.758
...shaking her heinie while she
washes my dentures in the sink.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.195
That's what keeps me going.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.031
That and the 12 pizzas
I've eaten in the last three days.

14:58.999 --> 15:02.135
Thanks, Dad. Once again,
you wow me with your wisdom.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.071
But I've decided
I'm keeping them both.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.073
For once, a Bundy's
gonna have it all.

15:08.475 --> 15:12.246
I guess he'll have to learn for himself
what a rock-solid relationship means.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.948
Al, where's my orange juice?

15:15.182 --> 15:16.850
Florida, I reckon.

15:20.854 --> 15:24.558
Yup, two, two, two babes at once.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.294
God, I envy me.

15:27.528 --> 15:28.962
Hey, did you guys hear the news?

15:29.163 --> 15:31.298
Miss McGowen's dating a student.

15:31.732 --> 15:33.367
She ran off with a football player.

15:33.567 --> 15:37.171
Yeah, she said he was the only one
that could ever satisfy her.

15:37.504 --> 15:38.672
No big thing.

15:38.872 --> 15:41.808
That leaves me more time
to give to the young babe.

15:42.276 --> 15:45.379
Good news, babe.
Now you got me all to yourself.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.080
Drop dead.

15:47.281 --> 15:49.416
If you can't satisfy an older woman
like Miss McGowen...

15:49.583 --> 15:51.718
...what the hell
would I want with you?

15:53.253 --> 15:55.756
Well, let's just see how you feel
when the new teacher gets here.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.525
I haven't seen a temp yet
that didn't need a little loving.

16:01.495 --> 16:03.263
I'm Mrs. A. Mariner...

16:03.463 --> 16:06.033
...and I'll be the new teacher
for the rest of the semester.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.408
And then again, there's always
Chuck E. Cheese with Dad.

16:14.942 --> 16:18.412
Well, the great thing about being at
the bottom is you can't fall any lower.

16:19.213 --> 16:21.248
You cradle-robber!

16:22.149 --> 16:24.918
You, you... Cher!

16:26.286 --> 16:28.288
Maybe it can get worse.

16:29.623 --> 16:30.991
Hey, look, it can.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.560
I just lost control of my bladder.

16:36.430 --> 16:39.132
I know what you want, "Miss Gabor."

16:39.333 --> 16:40.634
You see that house and that Dodge...

16:40.834 --> 16:42.836
...and say, "Some people live like this,
why can't I?"

16:43.036 --> 16:46.507
Well, you can't just take my son,
have your way sexually with him...

16:46.707 --> 16:48.976
...and not expect some repercussions
from a concerned parent.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.745
I played high school football.
I know the score.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.884
Son, are you really going out
with this prune-face?

16:58.752 --> 17:00.888
What strange hold do you have
over the boy?

17:01.088 --> 17:04.657
How many happy homes have
you broken in your thousand years?

17:07.961 --> 17:09.963
Sure, I know my boy
is almost a virgin.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.368
But you can no longer take advantage.
I have called the proper authorities.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.539
There she is.
The strumpet with the blue hair.

17:19.071 --> 17:21.208
I'll tell you something else.
She lied about her age.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.710
Last time she saw 40 was 1840.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.954
I'm sorry I had to do that, son,
but damn it, I love you!

17:37.157 --> 17:38.926
Oh, Bud, Mommy's out of tampons.

17:45.399 --> 17:48.302
Oh, yeah, that's what was missing.

17:51.572 --> 17:53.841
Now, right off, I don't know that man.

17:54.842 --> 17:57.377
You guys are probably thinking,
because he called me son...

17:57.578 --> 17:59.413
...that he was my Dad.

18:01.615 --> 18:04.818
Wait a second. Maybe this is a dream.
Yeah, that's it.

18:05.018 --> 18:07.521
If this were really happening,
I'd have to drop out of college.

18:07.721 --> 18:09.756
I'll wak e up any second.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.892
Wak e up, Bud.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.328
Oh, I mean, can't you
hear me crying?

18:14.528 --> 18:16.129
Wak e me up.

18:16.330 --> 18:18.499
I know. I'll prove it's a dream.

18:18.699 --> 18:20.667
I'll tak e down my pants...

18:21.635 --> 18:24.505
...and it'll be so embarrassing,
I'll wak e up.

18:31.712 --> 18:34.281
I'm even dreaming
I ran out of underwear.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.319
Oh, and son...

18:40.305 --> 18:46.924
