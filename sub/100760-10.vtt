00:16.350 --> 00:17.685
Good morning, Mr. Benson.

00:18.978 --> 00:20.098
Good morning, Ms. Kannerman.

00:22.732 --> 00:24.734
Good morning, Mr. Choak.

Oh!

00:35.119 --> 00:37.246
Finally, a decent bagel!

00:37.288 --> 00:39.373
Thank you, Horizen!

00:39.415 --> 00:40.875
Oh.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.932
Hello, Nathan.

00:56.974 --> 01:00.060
You don't have to answer me yet.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.647
I'm going to count to three.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.691
Try and count with me.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.028
One.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.530
Two.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.003
We need to be a united front.
You need to stay on script.

01:26.045 --> 01:27.963
Or maybe you need
to get better at adapting.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.757
And we're partners.
I don't work for you.

01:29.799 --> 01:33.052
Well, you didn't file the papers
of incorporation. I did.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.470
We have a verbal agreement,

01:34.512 --> 01:36.072
and I'll stick with it,
but don't push me.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.866
You bring this shit up now,
after I bust my ass

01:37.890 --> 01:39.683
for the last two years?

01:39.725 --> 01:41.727
Okay.
Let's not turn on each other.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.187
We both want the same thing.

01:43.229 --> 01:44.748
Do we, Jamie?
'Cause from here, it looks like

01:44.772 --> 01:46.565
you want to play the part
of a tech mogul,

01:46.607 --> 01:48.877
and I actually want to do shit
and make money for my family.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.194
I don't care
who gets the credit.

01:50.236 --> 01:51.737
Okay, shut this down.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.405
They're coming.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.533
United front.

01:55.574 --> 01:58.035
Boys on the same page yet?

01:58.077 --> 02:00.454
Yeah. We're sticking
with Cavern.

02:00.496 --> 02:02.915
So... small-time.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.292
- But we keep control.
- Mm-hmm.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.919
Sorry, Oliver.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.754
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.215
I'll get over it.

02:11.257 --> 02:12.925
Oh, uh...

02:12.967 --> 02:15.427
you and Ingrid still on
for dinner Friday night?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.513
- Of course.
- Good. I'll see you then.

02:17.555 --> 02:19.807
You have a beautiful home,
Mr. Kannerman.

02:19.849 --> 02:21.559
Ah. Well, thank you, Nathan.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.478
You know, there is a house
for sale just down the street.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.022
I don't suppose your mom would
like to live here, would she?

02:27.064 --> 02:29.441
Well, my mom can
barely afford rent

02:29.483 --> 02:31.527
on her one-bedroom, so, uh...

02:31.569 --> 02:36.156
Yeah. It's too bad it didn't
work out with Beyond and us.

02:36.198 --> 02:39.910
My partners were willing
to go a lot higher.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.997
Well, my partner's,
uh, a little stubborn.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.999
You know, Nathan, the real value

02:45.040 --> 02:48.669
of Beyond is that code
that you made.

02:48.711 --> 02:52.715
Now, uh... we would be willing

02:52.756 --> 02:55.926
to pay a significant amount
for just a copy.

02:55.968 --> 02:59.096
Um, well,
Jamie would never go for that.

02:59.138 --> 03:01.724
No. No, I didn't think he would.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.686
Of course...

03:05.728 --> 03:08.397
he wouldn't have to know.

03:10.608 --> 03:13.152
It would have to be
a very significant amount.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.238
Three.

03:21.327 --> 03:23.454
Nathan, it's me.

03:23.495 --> 03:26.373
It's okay.
Nobody's listening.

03:26.415 --> 03:29.168
We got away with it.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.669
So, what did you learn?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.838
Where am I? Is this Lakeview?

03:32.880 --> 03:36.050
Yes, this is Lakeview.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.396
What? Are you behind me?!

03:58.572 --> 04:01.575

04:10.876 --> 04:13.170
Maybe, but, uh,

I might be hanging out with some
of the other paying guests.

is very depressing.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.021
I don't owe him love for that.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.439
I know.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.192
But my gut says he's a good guy.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.486
I mean, you work with angels.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.780
Maybe you're finding out that
Nathan's just a real person

16:28.822 --> 16:30.031
with flaws.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.741
No, it was worse than that, Dad.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.910
I thought he was trying
to help people,

16:33.952 --> 16:35.995
but he sold his dream for money,

16:36.037 --> 16:38.331
and then got murdered
to cover it up.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.541
Maybe.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.459
Doesn't add up to me.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.962
Kannerman is not that powerful.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.464
I mean, he had people in
your office deleting memories,

16:46.506 --> 16:48.925
and some sort of professional
assassin in New York?

16:48.967 --> 16:50.969
That guy was in L.A., too.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.263
No, must be more to the story.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.056
I saw every tampered memory.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.641
Him sneaking code to Kannerman.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.102
Fighting with Jamie,
the guy who fucked with his car.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.437
They all connect.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.313
I mean, somebody just sent a guy

17:02.355 --> 17:04.899
to break into my apartment
and kill me.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.360
I hate that they know
where you live.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.406
Noni...

17:11.448 --> 17:14.492
I have some friends that are big
in the Ludd movement.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.578
What? Dad!

17:16.619 --> 17:19.056
I have to make some calls, but
I can hide you in the mountains

17:19.080 --> 17:20.540
in a house
completely off the grid.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.917
But Nathan is only on the grid.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.461
Well, is it over with him
or not?

17:33.303 --> 17:34.763
Voice only?

17:34.804 --> 17:36.598
Are you with someone?

17:36.639 --> 17:38.391
No.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.810
Okay, look,
my dad and I talked about it,

17:40.852 --> 17:43.062
and we don't think this is over.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.607
Someone's behind Kannerman,
and whoever it is

17:45.648 --> 17:48.234
- has a lot of resources.
- Oh.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.278
You're not the bad guy here
so much.

17:50.320 --> 17:54.032
- You're one
of the victims, too.
- Mm-hmm.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.493
I don't think they know
you got your memories back.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.912
If they find out,
you'll get deleted.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.998
They came after me
'cause I helped you in L.A.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.668
We're gonna be in danger until
we expose whatever this is.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.963
Mm-hmm.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.925
Why are you being so weird?

18:11.966 --> 18:14.511
Don't you have a reaction
to this?

18:14.552 --> 18:16.346
You should hide.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.681
I have a safe place to go,

18:18.723 --> 18:20.725
but...

18:20.767 --> 18:23.102
I couldn't contact you.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.857
I need to know.

18:27.899 --> 18:30.485
Everything in my brain
is telling me

18:30.527 --> 18:34.405
to walk away from you, but...

18:34.447 --> 18:38.117
everything else is looking
for a reason not to.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.704
I haven't...

18:41.746 --> 18:45.250
felt at home in this world...

18:45.291 --> 18:47.126
since Mom died.

18:49.254 --> 18:52.173
Maybe that's why I work
at Horizen.

18:52.215 --> 18:54.968
And maybe I developed a habit
of expecting the worst

18:55.009 --> 18:57.136
so I wouldn't get hurt.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.096
Nora...

18:58.137 --> 18:59.556
Let me finish.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.099
But maybe that's stupid.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.184
You know,
why focus on what's wrong

19:03.226 --> 19:05.603
and not on what's right?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.605
Because what's right is...

19:07.647 --> 19:12.277
I feel something for you that
I just don't feel anywhere else,

19:12.318 --> 19:15.238
anytime else, with anyone else.

19:16.698 --> 19:19.951
And if I'm being honest...

19:19.993 --> 19:22.829
those moments are
the only things I care about.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.166
And...

19:27.208 --> 19:30.086
if you make a fool of me

19:30.128 --> 19:33.339
and trick me, like Jamie...

19:35.300 --> 19:37.927
I'm going to have
to take that risk.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.893
I love you, Nathan.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.607
