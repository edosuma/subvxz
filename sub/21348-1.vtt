00:40.078 --> 00:41.111
Hello?

00:41.113 --> 00:42.579
'Oh, hi, honey.'

00:42.581 --> 00:44.581
'I don't know why you
sent me this way, honey.'

00:44.583 --> 00:48.485
'I, I've never been this way.
I do not like this road.'

00:48.487 --> 00:50.254
'oh, okay, you know, I'm
gonna let you go, honey.'

00:50.256 --> 00:52.489
I've got to, I've got
to pay attention here.

00:52.491 --> 00:54.558
Okay, alright, bye-bye.

01:06.271 --> 01:09.807
Come on! Oh, no! Oh, my god.

01:09.809 --> 01:12.409
'God, no!'

01:13.344 --> 01:14.678
'No!'

01:18.616 --> 01:19.817
Oh, no.

01:32.130 --> 01:33.597
Oh, god!

02:32.790 --> 02:34.525
It's good, it's good.

02:34.527 --> 02:37.327
Hey guys, hey, how are you?

02:37.329 --> 02:39.463
- You guys look great.
- 'We love you, bill.'

02:39.465 --> 02:42.166
'your as old as a main frame, bill.'

02:42.168 --> 02:45.302
Oh, thanks, Alex, a main frame?
Please, I'm not that old.

02:45.304 --> 02:47.604
Maybe as old as a trs-80.

02:47.606 --> 02:49.706
Wow, Lauren, take it easy.

02:51.376 --> 02:53.644
Thank you everyone so much for being here.

02:53.646 --> 02:55.212
Whoa! There he is.

02:55.214 --> 02:57.514
- I love you, daddy.
- I love you too, Ty.

02:57.516 --> 03:00.217
And I know you're not as old as trs

03:00.219 --> 03:01.552
or whatever she said.

03:01.554 --> 03:03.921
That's right, aunt Lauren's silly, huh?

03:03.923 --> 03:06.890
Yeah, I'm not that old, but I'm pretty old.

03:06.892 --> 03:08.725
I'm older than most computers.

03:08.727 --> 03:10.727
Look how beautiful your mum looks.

03:10.729 --> 03:13.297
- Hi.
- Thank you so much for putting this together.

03:13.299 --> 03:15.365
Of course, you know I love
doing things for you.

03:15.367 --> 03:18.468
- I love you guys.
- So we have a little surprise.

03:18.470 --> 03:20.804
- Oh, you do?
- We do, don't we?

03:20.806 --> 03:23.240
- Yes.
- I thought we said no presents.

03:23.242 --> 03:24.808
You know me better than that.

03:24.810 --> 03:26.577
Now if everyone will please join us

03:26.579 --> 03:27.878
at the gazebo.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.313
We can show you the presentation.

03:29.315 --> 03:30.814
Alright, we're going to the gazebo.

03:30.816 --> 03:31.882
'Come on.'

03:31.884 --> 03:35.252
except for Alex, Alex can't come.

03:35.254 --> 03:38.655
Alright, you go sit down right
here, yâ€™all just file in.

03:38.657 --> 03:42.559
- Okay.
- 'Alright, everyone gather in.'

03:42.561 --> 03:46.496
we all know that bill has worked
like a dog for the last 30 years

03:46.498 --> 03:48.498
'he's hardly had any time for himself.'

03:48.500 --> 03:50.834
he's given so much to the company

03:50.836 --> 03:53.670
'to his friends and his family.'

03:53.672 --> 03:55.906
Tyler and I wanted to give
you something just for you.

03:57.675 --> 04:01.411
Oh! Cowboy hat, thank you.

04:01.413 --> 04:04.248
Okay, now you just start the presentation.

04:11.489 --> 04:12.522
You bought me a horse?

04:12.524 --> 04:14.258
Be patient, silly.

04:21.031 --> 04:22.933
So you want to be a cowboy?

04:22.935 --> 04:24.568
'You want to ride a bull, rope a steer'

04:24.570 --> 04:25.936
'ride in a trail drive'

04:25.938 --> 04:27.871
'wake up on a brisk morning in your tent'

04:27.873 --> 04:29.306
'in the middle of nature.'

04:29.308 --> 04:32.009
well, come on out to hidden valley ranch.

04:32.011 --> 04:34.778
'Enjoy the fresh air of Arizona'

04:34.780 --> 04:37.014
'and enjoy the cowboy life.'

04:37.016 --> 04:40.717
enjoy the cowboy life. Yee-haw!

04:42.921 --> 04:46.290
Ready to pack 'em up and
pull 'em out, cowboy?

04:48.627 --> 04:51.795
Well, my dreams are coming true.
How did you think of this?

04:51.797 --> 04:54.298
Well, we all know you play
with Tyler's horse toys

04:54.300 --> 04:55.399
more than he does.

04:55.401 --> 04:57.668
That, that is true.

04:57.670 --> 04:58.902
Ever since I can remember

04:58.904 --> 05:00.904
I've always wanted to be a cowboy

05:00.906 --> 05:02.906
but my father bought me a computer

05:02.908 --> 05:05.742
and the rest is history.

05:05.744 --> 05:07.611
I'm gonna be a cowboy, y'all.

05:07.613 --> 05:09.746
Yee-haw!

05:09.748 --> 05:13.784
Ah! Now, you're the cowboy.

05:13.786 --> 05:14.818
Say, yee-haw!

05:14.820 --> 05:16.620
- Yee-haw!
- You hear that?

05:16.622 --> 05:18.822
Thank you.

05:33.604 --> 05:35.472
Oh, I think you look cute.

05:35.474 --> 05:37.074
Cute like Woody from the "toy story."

05:37.076 --> 05:40.377
This is exactly what John
Wayne wore in "true grit."

05:40.379 --> 05:42.379
- John who?
- Ha-ha!

05:42.381 --> 05:44.348
Don't worry about it, Ty,
it's-it's not important.

05:44.350 --> 05:45.549
The important thing is

05:45.551 --> 05:47.718
I'm leaving Sonoma a tech nerd

05:47.720 --> 05:49.553
and I'm gonna come back a cowboy.

05:49.555 --> 05:51.888
- Yeah!
- Now give me a hug and a kiss.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.692
- I love you.
- I love you too, buddy.

05:55.694 --> 05:58.462
So, does this mean that
we're getting a horse

05:58.464 --> 05:59.663
when you come back?

05:59.665 --> 06:01.498
- Ah.
- Well, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:01.500 --> 06:02.866
You guys are taking this cowboy bit

06:02.868 --> 06:04.568
just a little too far.

06:05.903 --> 06:08.972
- I love you. Thank you so much.
- I love you, too.

06:08.974 --> 06:11.007
Thank you so much, look, if
you need anything, just call.

06:11.009 --> 06:13.510
Everything will be fine, don't worry.

06:13.512 --> 06:15.645
Plus I get to stay in this
gorgeous house for two weeks.

06:15.647 --> 06:16.980
Okay. Alright.

06:16.982 --> 06:20.384
Get back over here and give me a hug.

06:20.386 --> 06:22.652
Come here. Oh! I love you, baby.

06:22.654 --> 06:23.987
- Be good, okay?
- Okay.

06:23.989 --> 06:25.756
- Alright?
- We'll be fine.

06:25.758 --> 06:27.023
- Bye, love you, bye.
- Bye.

06:27.025 --> 06:28.825
Bye.

06:28.827 --> 06:30.427
You're gonna blow them some kisses.

06:31.028 --> 06:32.496
'Bye.'

07:14.572 --> 07:16.206
bill, we're here.

07:16.208 --> 07:17.974
Oh, wow!

07:36.093 --> 07:37.127
Wow!

07:37.129 --> 07:39.629
Whoo!

07:41.165 --> 07:43.633
This is amazing, sweetie.

07:43.635 --> 07:45.068
Oh, we should build one just like it.

07:45.070 --> 07:47.471
Or just buy the whole ranch.

07:47.473 --> 07:49.906
Sorry, ranch isn't for sale.

07:49.908 --> 07:51.641
You're the man from the video.

07:51.643 --> 07:53.510
- That's me.
- Wow! I'm, uh..

07:53.512 --> 07:55.912
Bill and Elizabeth Goodhart.

07:55.914 --> 07:58.148
It's a pleasure to meet you. Monte Higgins.

07:58.150 --> 07:59.649
I'm impressed.

07:59.651 --> 08:01.518
Oh, bill is looking forward to this.

08:01.520 --> 08:02.586
He's really excited about this.

08:02.588 --> 08:04.087
And how do you feel young lady?

08:04.089 --> 08:07.591
Oh, I am too, but it's
really his dream come true.

08:07.593 --> 08:09.493
That's why my wife and I bought the ranch

08:09.495 --> 08:10.961
to make dreams come true.

08:10.963 --> 08:13.697
Why don't you two go inside,
have a drink, relax a bit.

08:13.699 --> 08:16.099
I'm gonna run up to the rest of the
guests and we'll have a pow wow.

08:16.101 --> 08:17.767
- Sounds good.
- See you after.

08:17.769 --> 08:19.002
'Bye, thanks.'

08:22.773 --> 08:24.174
oh!

08:24.176 --> 08:28.011
Oh, this is so cute. I love those couches.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.281
This is great. Hey!

08:31.283 --> 08:33.149
This is the best retirement ever.

08:33.150 --> 08:34.951
How did you think of this?

08:34.953 --> 08:38.255
It was easy. It was either
this or fantasy baseball camp.

08:38.256 --> 08:41.124
Fantasy baseball camp would
have been pretty good too.

08:41.126 --> 08:44.126
Alright, easy slugger. Maybe next year.

08:44.129 --> 08:46.129
You are the most beautiful, thoughtful

08:46.131 --> 08:48.798
intelligent woman, I've ever met.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.233
Have I told you how much I love you?

08:50.235 --> 08:52.536
Not in the last half an hour.

08:52.538 --> 08:54.905
I love you very much.

08:54.907 --> 08:57.207
And I love you too, William
Jonathan Goodhart.

08:57.209 --> 08:58.542
- Come.
- Oh.

08:58.544 --> 08:59.976
I like it when you say my full name.

09:01.546 --> 09:05.715
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to hidden valley ranch.

09:05.717 --> 09:08.652
First thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna test your skills.

09:08.654 --> 09:10.654
'This is for your safety'

09:10.656 --> 09:14.257
and we want everybody to have a good time.

09:14.259 --> 09:16.993
We don't want to put you on a
horse that you can't control

09:16.995 --> 09:18.762
'and we don't want you on a horse'

09:18.764 --> 09:20.096
'as above your ability.'

09:20.098 --> 09:22.899
so right now, go on into the bar

09:22.901 --> 09:26.102
belly up, enjoy yourself, relax today.

09:26.104 --> 09:27.938
And the first thing tomorrow morning

09:27.940 --> 09:30.173
we'll meet at the stables.

09:30.175 --> 09:31.675
Come on, folks.

09:31.677 --> 09:33.843
- Alright.
- 'Alright, yeah.'

09:33.845 --> 09:36.713
'let us get going. Don't we?'

09:44.021 --> 09:45.288
- name your horse...
- fandango.

09:45.290 --> 09:47.190
- Oh, that's a good name.
- Mm-hmm.

09:47.192 --> 09:49.859
Oh, I'm a little nervous
to go riding with..

09:49.861 --> 09:51.127
- You're gonna be great.
- You think?

09:51.129 --> 09:52.896
Yeah, I guess so.

09:52.898 --> 09:54.631
You're a renaissance fan
you can do anything.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.800
Well.

09:56.802 --> 09:59.369
- I guess this is where I leave you.
- I guess so, have fun.

09:59.371 --> 10:00.870
Are you sure you don't wanna come

10:00.872 --> 10:03.306
and watch all this riding
through the prairie.

10:03.308 --> 10:05.775
No, I just have to use my imagination.

10:11.315 --> 10:13.283
- Mr. Goodhart.
- Yes.

10:13.285 --> 10:15.885
- Ma'am. Are you ready?
- I am ready.

10:15.887 --> 10:18.655
- I have your horse.
- Okay.

10:18.657 --> 10:20.690
- 'Alright.' - Uh, Travis.

10:20.692 --> 10:21.725
- Yeah?
- Travis, right?

10:21.727 --> 10:22.993
Yeah, Travis.

10:22.995 --> 10:26.329
Um, my husbands never
been on a horse before.

10:26.331 --> 10:28.832
I'll keep a close eye on him, okay?
I promise.

10:28.834 --> 10:30.667
- Thank you.
- Don't worry.

10:30.669 --> 10:32.235
- Hi, here we go.
- Okay.

10:32.237 --> 10:35.071
Come around here.

10:35.073 --> 10:37.273
Easy, swing your leg up there.

10:37.275 --> 10:38.775
Ah!

10:38.777 --> 10:39.976
Alright.

10:40.778 --> 10:42.178
Alright, have fun.

10:42.180 --> 10:45.215
- Thank you, I love you.
- I love you, too.

10:50.287 --> 10:52.355
Bye!

10:52.357 --> 10:53.423
Hoo-hoo.

11:26.957 --> 11:29.025
- How you feeling, cowboy?
- Good.

11:31.228 --> 11:32.996
It's a lot better than using a computer.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.401
- Doing fine, Mr. Goodhart?
- Yeah.

11:38.403 --> 11:40.170
Make sure that horse knows your in control.

11:40.172 --> 11:41.971
But, but I'm not in control.

11:41.973 --> 11:44.708
Yeah, you'll get there.
Keep those reigns snug.

11:44.710 --> 11:46.009
- Not too tight.
- Right.

11:46.011 --> 11:47.811
But he's not gonna buck me off then?

11:47.813 --> 11:49.813
No, not if he respects you.

11:49.815 --> 11:52.816
And how do I get him to do that?

11:52.818 --> 11:55.752
Sit up straight, be confident.
Let him know who's Boss.

11:55.754 --> 11:57.420
- Okay, like this?
- Just like that.

11:57.422 --> 11:59.022
Well, when do I get to say yee-haw?

11:59.024 --> 12:02.058
- Right now.
- Okay. Yee-haw!

12:17.775 --> 12:20.176
Alright, folks.

12:20.178 --> 12:22.212
It's time to turn around

12:22.214 --> 12:24.180
'and head back to the ranch.'

12:24.182 --> 12:25.882
'now listen up'

12:25.884 --> 12:27.751
'all of your horses know the way back'

12:27.753 --> 12:29.853
'and they might want to take off and run'

12:29.855 --> 12:31.421
'so, it's very important..'

12:31.423 --> 12:33.356
'hang on to those reigns
'and stay in control.'

12:33.358 --> 12:34.390
'alright, let's turn around.'

12:35.761 --> 12:37.093
whoa!

12:37.095 --> 12:40.096
Whoa! Who..

12:40.098 --> 12:42.432
- Don't panic.
- Ahh!

12:42.434 --> 12:46.870
- Okay, hoo! Help! Hoo.
- Travis, go get him.

12:46.872 --> 12:48.872
- Stop! - Haa-haa-haa!

12:48.874 --> 12:50.073
'Ahh!'

12:50.075 --> 12:52.509
Travis.. Oh, oh, he..

12:52.511 --> 12:55.245
Help! Somebody..

12:55.247 --> 12:57.781
Help!

12:57.783 --> 12:59.015
Oh!

13:00.050 --> 13:01.284
Help!

13:22.239 --> 13:24.174
Mr. Goodhart!

13:24.176 --> 13:25.475
Mr. Goodhart.

13:25.477 --> 13:27.076
Dammit! Mr. Goodhart.

13:28.279 --> 13:29.846
Mr. Goodhart, are you..

13:53.437 --> 13:56.272
He's not moving, he's in bad shape.

14:09.019 --> 14:10.320
'Call the lodge.'

14:10.322 --> 14:12.021
'get medics here right away.'

14:37.181 --> 14:38.381
'Mrs. Goodhart?'

14:40.317 --> 14:43.086
Mrs. Goodhart, I'm gonna need
you to follow me immediately.

14:43.088 --> 14:46.556
- Why?
- Your husband, he's been hurt.

14:46.558 --> 14:49.626
- What?
- I don't know all the details. But, it's, it's pretty serious.

15:05.509 --> 15:08.344
'We had to put him into induced coma.
His brain is bleeding.'

15:08.346 --> 15:09.913
'we'll be taking him into
surgery immediately'

15:09.915 --> 15:10.947
'to relieve the pressure.'

15:10.949 --> 15:12.382
can I, can I please talk to him.

15:12.384 --> 15:14.317
Yeah.

15:14.319 --> 15:17.220
Oh, bill, bill.

15:19.424 --> 15:21.157
I love you so much.

15:53.123 --> 15:55.224
I'm only gonna be gone a week. Okay?

15:55.226 --> 15:57.226
You don't have to go, mommy.

15:57.228 --> 15:58.962
I do, I do.

15:58.964 --> 16:01.164
I have to go take care of
some business in Miami.

16:01.166 --> 16:03.099
That's what you said when you and daddy

16:03.101 --> 16:06.436
went to that stupid cowboy camp.

16:06.438 --> 16:08.071
Baby..

16:08.073 --> 16:09.405
We've talked about this.

16:09.407 --> 16:11.474
Okay, everything is gonna be fine

16:11.476 --> 16:13.276
nothing is gonna happen to me.

16:13.278 --> 16:15.678
You can't promise that.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.613
Can you?

16:17.615 --> 16:20.183
'I don't wanna lose you, too.'

16:20.185 --> 16:21.351
sweetheart..

16:21.353 --> 16:22.618
'Don't worry.'

16:22.620 --> 16:26.255
okay? I promise you, I will be back.

16:26.257 --> 16:28.324
Mommy will never ever leave you.

16:29.026 --> 16:30.226
'Alright?'

16:31.996 --> 16:33.496
okay? Sweetheart.

16:37.368 --> 16:38.534
I love you.

16:38.536 --> 16:41.204
Okay? It's just one week.

16:41.206 --> 16:42.505
Have fun with aunt Lauren.

16:42.507 --> 16:44.607
- Okay?
- Okay.

16:44.609 --> 16:46.609
Alright.

16:46.611 --> 16:46.609
Thank you.

16:46.611 --> 16:51.180
- We'll be fine.
- I love you. You be great, okay.

16:57.287 --> 16:59.222
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

17:11.736 --> 17:13.536
Oh, baby, it's okay, it's okay.

17:13.538 --> 17:16.406
- 'I love you, baby.' - Bye, mommy.

17:16.407 --> 17:19.108
- Bye, have fun.
- We'll have fun.

17:42.566 --> 17:44.167
- Hi, Mrs. Goodhart.
- Hi, how are you?

17:44.169 --> 17:46.102
- It's good to see you.
- Thank you. Hello.

17:48.338 --> 17:49.739
Alright, let's see.

18:04.822 --> 18:08.257
- Hello.
- Hi, sorry, I'm late.

18:08.259 --> 18:09.792
Oh, you're right there, next
to lady in fuchsia, okay?

18:09.794 --> 18:11.761
Okay, thank you very much.

18:15.365 --> 18:16.499
Excuse me, Ma'am.

18:16.501 --> 18:18.734
- I have that seat.
- Oh..

18:18.736 --> 18:21.537
'Ladies and gentlemen, we will
be closing the doors shortly.'

18:21.539 --> 18:24.140
'please, prepare for take-off,
shut off all phones'

18:24.142 --> 18:25.708
'fold your trays up and
put your seat backs'

18:25.710 --> 18:27.210
into the upright position.

18:30.214 --> 18:31.781
Excuse me.

18:31.783 --> 18:35.351
Um, is your name Travis
from hidden valley ranch?

18:37.154 --> 18:39.288
- Mrs. Goodhart?
- Elizabeth.

18:40.324 --> 18:41.657
- Hi.
- Oh, my..

18:41.659 --> 18:44.127
- Hi. So good to see you again.
- You wouldn't..

18:44.129 --> 18:46.562
- An-an odd coincidence, huh?
- Yes. Yeah, it is.

18:46.564 --> 18:49.832
I mean, how are you?
How've you been since..

18:49.834 --> 18:51.868
Um, good.

18:51.870 --> 18:53.870
You know, considering..

18:53.872 --> 18:55.204
Well, you look great.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.141
Thanks.

19:04.248 --> 19:05.281
How's your boy?

19:05.283 --> 19:08.351
Oh... Devastated.

19:08.353 --> 19:10.153
You know, just taking it one day at a time.

19:10.155 --> 19:12.455
I-I'm learning that children
either hide their emotions

19:12.457 --> 19:15.224
or just completely ignore the pain..

19:16.860 --> 19:19.595
What about you?

19:19.597 --> 19:22.331
Yeah, well, I guess I do
a little bit of both.

19:23.433 --> 19:25.268
I don't know if that's very healthy.

19:25.270 --> 19:26.769
No. Probably not.

19:26.771 --> 19:30.506
But I, I do understand.

19:30.508 --> 19:32.441
My wife was killed in a car accident

19:32.443 --> 19:35.912
about six months before
your husband's accident.

19:35.914 --> 19:38.948
I-I didn't know. I'm-I'm
so sorry to hear that.

19:38.950 --> 19:40.416
Thank you.

19:44.621 --> 19:46.322
'Flight attendants... '

19:46.324 --> 19:47.890
you might wanna put your seat belt on.

19:47.892 --> 19:49.692
Oh, right, yeah.

19:49.694 --> 19:52.828
- I really don't fly very much.
- No?

19:52.830 --> 19:55.298
In fact, I hate flying.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.333
Thirty five thousand feet above the earth

19:57.335 --> 19:59.635
in a tin can is not my idea of fun.

19:59.637 --> 20:01.871
You know, these pilots are
very, very, well trained.

20:01.873 --> 20:03.439
You're in good hands.

20:03.441 --> 20:05.541
I think I trust my horse
more than I do the pilot.

20:14.484 --> 20:17.887
- Hey, are you okay?
- Not really.

20:21.858 --> 20:24.961
Okay, um, let's do some
deep breaths together.

20:25.997 --> 20:27.396
- Okay?
- Okay.

20:28.498 --> 20:29.765
Come on, I will do with you.

20:32.904 --> 20:35.238
One. Mm-hmm.

20:36.273 --> 20:38.574
Two, slowly.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.746
Three. That's it.

20:43.748 --> 20:44.847
That's better.

20:49.787 --> 20:51.988
Sorry, I just..

20:54.958 --> 20:56.425
It's okay.

20:58.528 --> 20:59.829
It'll be okay.

20:59.831 --> 21:00.863
Okay.

21:06.803 --> 21:08.537
'So, bill's business just took off.'

21:08.539 --> 21:10.306
and we get to travel all over the world.

21:10.308 --> 21:12.742
I mean, he had to spend most
of the time in the office.

21:12.744 --> 21:14.377
But I get to explore every city.

21:14.379 --> 21:16.779
Yeah, you've led a very interesting life.

21:17.781 --> 21:19.782
But tell me more about you.

21:19.784 --> 21:22.318
No, there's really not much to tell.

21:22.320 --> 21:23.619
I don't wanna bore you.

21:23.621 --> 21:25.621
You're not boring, come on.

21:25.623 --> 21:28.658
I don't think you're gonna
be boring at all, tell me.

21:28.660 --> 21:29.925
I bet you're very interesting.

21:29.927 --> 21:31.360
- You do?
- Mmm-hmm.

21:32.896 --> 21:35.598
Just a cowboy.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.733
"Just a cowboy." I mean, cowboys.

21:37.735 --> 21:39.602
That's what we read stories about.

21:39.604 --> 21:41.671
Men like bill wanna <i> be</i> when they grow up.

21:41.673 --> 21:44.740
- I mean..
- Yeah.

21:44.742 --> 21:47.410
Okay, so, tell me why you
are going to Miami then?

21:47.412 --> 21:50.780
- Well, I'm going to a rodeo.
- A rodeo in Miami?

21:50.782 --> 21:52.748
Yeah, well, not actually in Miami

21:52.750 --> 21:55.584
a little bit east of there.

21:55.586 --> 21:59.922
- So, a rodeo in the everglades?
- Yeah, sort of...

21:59.924 --> 22:02.825
what, are you gonna feed the
cows to the alligators?

22:02.827 --> 22:04.627
Maybe.

22:04.629 --> 22:06.429
I'm not actually competing in the rodeo.

22:06.431 --> 22:08.831
I'm putting on a roping
clinic for some of the guys.

22:08.833 --> 22:11.634
Okay, see, that's interesting.

22:14.538 --> 22:16.605
And so that's about the time

22:16.607 --> 22:18.674
that I started reading Kerouac.

22:18.676 --> 22:21.344
Kerouac? Wow, that's impressive.

22:21.346 --> 22:24.647
Oh. Sure, I also read Fitzgerald, Bukowski

22:24.649 --> 22:28.451
but my all-time favorite writer has to be..

22:28.453 --> 22:29.785
Hemingway.

22:29.787 --> 22:31.787
Ah!

22:31.789 --> 22:33.956
- You too?
- Yeah, me too, of course.

22:33.958 --> 22:37.393
Yeah, see, I-i guess
cowboys are pretty smart.

22:37.395 --> 22:39.729
We just don't like to
show it all of the time.

22:39.731 --> 22:42.898
We like to stay humble, I guess.

22:42.900 --> 22:44.934
'Flight attendants, prepare for landing.'

22:56.012 --> 22:58.981
um, you know, Travis, I
never got to thank you.

23:00.817 --> 23:03.719
I know that you did everything
you could to save bill's life.

23:05.689 --> 23:07.590
I didn't keep my promise to you.

23:09.393 --> 23:11.694
What, what promise?

23:11.696 --> 23:13.996
I promised you that day
that I would keep him safe

23:13.998 --> 23:15.564
and I didn't do it.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.100
I'm so sorry.

23:20.871 --> 23:22.772
I don't know why

23:22.774 --> 23:24.840
bill had to die that day

23:24.842 --> 23:27.476
but, I believe that god has a greater plan.

23:29.012 --> 23:30.913
I have to believe that otherwise
I wouldn't get out of bed

23:30.915 --> 23:32.715
in the morning.

23:32.717 --> 23:34.450
So..

23:34.452 --> 23:36.018
None of that was your fault.

23:39.189 --> 23:40.589
I appreciate that.

23:43.728 --> 23:46.095
Oh, we're not crashing, are we?

23:46.097 --> 23:48.898
Remember god's plan?

23:48.900 --> 23:52.468
I don't think it's to crash
over the Atlantic today.

23:52.470 --> 23:53.936
I really don't.

24:06.049 --> 24:07.983
Why, thank you.

24:08.852 --> 24:10.085
After you.

24:13.623 --> 24:15.958
- Bye bye.
- Thank you, thank you.

25:00.937 --> 25:03.772
I want you to know that before bill passed.

25:03.774 --> 25:06.008
He was so excited about all the work

25:06.010 --> 25:07.610
you were doing in south America.

25:07.612 --> 25:10.946
Oh, thank you. Thank
you, I appreciate that.

25:10.948 --> 25:13.115
And we are so very sorry for your loss.

25:13.117 --> 25:16.652
Mr. Goodhart was certainly
an inspiration to all of us.

25:16.654 --> 25:17.953
'He was a brilliant man for sure'

25:17.955 --> 25:20.556
'and he had a great sense of humor.'

25:20.558 --> 25:23.692
'this year we are on target
for a one hundred fifty..'

25:23.694 --> 25:25.528
have I told you how much I love you?

25:25.530 --> 25:27.863
'Our net revenue is even better
with an overall increase of..'

25:27.865 --> 25:29.064
love you.

25:29.066 --> 25:31.667
Well, okay.

25:31.669 --> 25:33.736
It goes in reverse.

25:33.738 --> 25:38.073
'We're going from $200 million
for this year to $225 million..'

25:48.151 --> 25:50.986
Marty, it's Elizabeth Goodhart.

25:50.988 --> 25:52.922
I think it's time to sell my shares.

26:20.717 --> 26:22.618
'Elizabeth? Is that you?'

26:23.320 --> 26:25.187
wha..

26:25.189 --> 26:27.690
Travis. What are you doing here?

26:27.692 --> 26:29.224
The rodeo was canceled

26:29.226 --> 26:31.193
and I'd never been to south beach

26:31.195 --> 26:33.095
so I'm wandering the beach
and I can't believe

26:33.097 --> 26:34.296
I see you sitting here.

26:34.298 --> 26:35.731
Well, I'm so sorry if it was canceled

26:35.733 --> 26:37.066
but I'm glad you're here.

26:37.068 --> 26:39.902
You know, at the airport
when we left each other

26:39.904 --> 26:41.704
I turned around.

26:41.706 --> 26:43.105
And I went after you.

26:43.107 --> 26:44.940
I tried to find you but you were gone.

26:44.942 --> 26:46.208
So, you've never been to south beach?

26:46.210 --> 26:48.110
Never.

26:48.112 --> 26:50.012
Do you have six hours to spare?

26:50.014 --> 26:51.046
Yeah.

26:51.048 --> 26:52.848
Okay, let me show you around.

26:52.850 --> 26:55.718
Yes, I would love that more than anything.

26:55.720 --> 26:58.287
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's do it.

29:23.233 --> 29:25.200
I never thought I'd fall in love again.

29:28.538 --> 29:30.372
You said the "I" word.

29:32.942 --> 29:36.044
I, I meant, um..

29:36.046 --> 29:39.815
I never thought I'd make love... Again.

29:41.518 --> 29:43.452
Isn't that the same thing?

29:47.525 --> 29:50.492
- No, no, don't-don't answer.
- It might be my son.

29:53.897 --> 29:56.832
- Hello?
- 'When are you coming home?'

29:56.834 --> 29:58.567
I-I miss you.

29:59.936 --> 30:02.471
Honey, it's 3:00 am. Are you okay?

30:02.473 --> 30:05.073
I just want you to come home.

30:05.075 --> 30:08.544
And... I want daddy back.

30:10.246 --> 30:13.982
Honey, I promise you..

30:13.984 --> 30:16.985
Daddy is everywhere we are, okay?

30:16.987 --> 30:19.288
'He's always looking down from heaven.'

30:19.290 --> 30:20.556
no!

30:20.558 --> 30:22.024
He isn't.

30:22.026 --> 30:23.358
'That's a lie.'

30:24.928 --> 30:27.596
please, come home now.

30:27.598 --> 30:29.431
'It's only a few more days, okay?'

30:29.433 --> 30:31.600
look, Liz, Liz, I'm so sorry.

30:31.602 --> 30:33.302
I didn't know he was calling you.

30:33.304 --> 30:35.504
But I will calm him down, okay.
Don't worry.

30:35.506 --> 30:37.139
Lauren, do you need me to come home?

30:37.141 --> 30:38.841
'No, you don't.'

30:38.843 --> 30:40.576
'everything will be fine.'

30:40.578 --> 30:43.011
- okay.
- Alright, we love you.

30:43.346 --> 30:45.013
Goodbye.

30:45.015 --> 30:47.115
Baby, it's okay. Now, come on.

30:47.117 --> 30:49.184
Do you want me to read you
another bed time story?

30:49.186 --> 30:51.620
Come, it's time to go to bed. Come.

30:53.890 --> 30:56.058
Sorry.

30:56.060 --> 30:58.327
I'm sorry.

30:58.329 --> 31:01.296
Look, it's late. I'll get going, okay.

31:02.532 --> 31:04.066
Travis, I, um..

31:07.136 --> 31:09.071
I really need you to stay.

31:52.682 --> 31:54.216
Travis?

31:56.019 --> 31:57.386
Travis?

32:01.024 --> 32:03.158
Travis?

32:09.365 --> 32:11.133
Room service.

32:14.637 --> 32:16.305
Good morning, beautiful.

32:21.210 --> 32:23.545
'Eggs Benedict, coffee'

32:23.547 --> 32:25.113
'orange juice..'

32:27.383 --> 32:30.452
and a rose.

32:32.322 --> 32:34.389
A rose? You didn't have to do that.

32:34.391 --> 32:36.591
Hmm, of course, I did.

32:36.593 --> 32:38.393
In fact, you'd better get used to that

32:38.395 --> 32:42.230
because I'm going to treat you every day

32:42.232 --> 32:43.999
like you're my queen.

32:45.168 --> 32:46.234
Okay.

32:46.236 --> 32:47.502
Okay.

32:56.279 --> 32:58.613
<i>I can't believe tomorrow
it's going to be over.</i>

32:58.615 --> 33:00.315
<i>This is gonna sound crazy</i>

33:00.317 --> 33:02.684
<i>but come back to Sonoma with me.</i>

33:02.686 --> 33:06.054
<i>Liz, I can't do that. I-I've
got to get back to the ranch.</i>

33:06.056 --> 33:07.589
<i>Monty's expecting me.</i>

33:07.591 --> 33:09.424
<i>Yeah, I don't mean to
be disrespectful, babe</i>

33:09.426 --> 33:12.561
<i>but I think Monty can handle
it without you and I can't.</i>

33:12.563 --> 33:14.196
<i>Come back to Sonoma</i>

33:14.198 --> 33:15.764
<i>we'll never know unless we try, right?</i>

33:15.766 --> 33:17.532
<i>I mean this is a fantasy out here.</i>

33:17.534 --> 33:21.269
<i>We need to get home and
experience real life.</i>

33:21.271 --> 33:22.604
<i>- Come on.
- Sounds amazing</i>

33:22.606 --> 33:24.773
but I, you know, I don't
live like this every day

33:24.775 --> 33:27.442
I've got responsibilities

33:27.444 --> 33:28.777
and bills to pay, and..

33:28.779 --> 33:31.546
I'm not going to live off of your dime.

33:31.548 --> 33:33.348
Well, I have a lot of dimes.

33:34.517 --> 33:36.685
Come on.

33:36.687 --> 33:38.286
Let's try.

33:38.288 --> 33:42.157
There's a great little hotel
right around the corner.

33:42.159 --> 33:43.392
Let's date.

33:47.363 --> 33:48.730
- Okay.
- Yeah?

33:48.732 --> 33:51.066
- Yeah, let's give it a shot.
- Really?

33:51.068 --> 33:53.702
- Yeah, okay?
- Okay.

33:54.670 --> 33:56.271
Let's do it.

34:40.716 --> 34:42.851
Mommy, you're home!

34:45.822 --> 34:50.292
- Babe! Oh!
- Oh, I missed you so much.

34:50.293 --> 34:54.096
I missed you too, oh, my gosh.

34:54.098 --> 34:57.265
- This is my friend Travis.
- Travis, this is Tyler, my son.

34:57.267 --> 34:58.567
He's a real cowboy.

34:58.569 --> 35:01.803
- Wow! A real cowboy?
- I sure am.

35:01.805 --> 35:03.371
Howdy, partner?

35:03.373 --> 35:05.407
- 'Good to meet you.' - Nice to meet you.

35:05.409 --> 35:07.809
And this is my sister Lauren.
Lauren, Travis.

35:07.811 --> 35:11.546
- Ma'am, it's a pleasure.
- Pleasure's mine.

35:11.548 --> 35:13.682
Um, the driver's gonna
take you to hotel meridian

35:13.684 --> 35:16.118
and my assistant took care of everything.

35:16.120 --> 35:19.421
Well, thank you. And, uh, can't
wait to start the adventure.

35:19.423 --> 35:21.156
- Seven o'clock.
- Yes.

35:21.158 --> 35:23.792
Travis is gonna have supper
with us tomorrow, okay?

35:23.794 --> 35:25.260
- Seven.
- I will be here.

35:25.262 --> 35:26.595
- Okay.
- Okay, alright.

35:26.597 --> 35:28.130
- Bye-bye, nice to meet you.
- Bye.

35:28.132 --> 35:30.265
See you then.

35:30.267 --> 35:32.434
Come on, tell me everything, how was it?

35:32.436 --> 35:34.236
- It was excellent.
- Yeah?

35:34.238 --> 35:37.305
- Wonderful.
- Great.

36:28.458 --> 36:29.724
'I'll get it.'

36:36.199 --> 36:38.300
hey, there.

36:38.302 --> 36:40.468
Mom, the cowboy's here.

36:40.470 --> 36:41.903
'Well, tell him to come in.'

36:43.239 --> 36:44.539
she says to come in.

36:44.541 --> 36:46.741
Okay, but first I have something for ya.

36:46.743 --> 36:48.777
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

36:50.580 --> 36:52.480
This is a wooden pony

36:53.683 --> 36:56.284
carved by a real Cherokee Indian.

36:58.221 --> 36:59.554
Wow!

37:00.723 --> 37:03.758
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:03.760 --> 37:07.229
Mom! Mom, look what Travis gave me.

37:24.347 --> 37:27.315
- Hi.
- Wow, look at you.

37:27.317 --> 37:30.518
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hi, he's upstairs.

37:30.520 --> 37:32.587
Okay.

37:37.927 --> 37:41.496
- I missed you.
- And I missed you too.

37:41.498 --> 37:44.432
Now, I brought some wine. I
don't know much about it

37:44.434 --> 37:46.534
but guy at the store said it was good.

37:46.536 --> 37:49.471
It would be perfect, they
set a table on here, come.

37:49.473 --> 37:50.872
- Great.
- So how was your day?

37:50.874 --> 37:52.607
- My day was great.
- Yeah?

37:52.609 --> 37:54.876
We bought the house and..

38:02.785 --> 38:04.919
'Come on, babe.'

38:04.921 --> 38:07.422
- Travis, Travis.
- Hey, buddy.

38:07.424 --> 38:09.491
How long have you been a cowboy?

38:09.493 --> 38:11.426
Well, I was born a cowboy.

38:11.428 --> 38:13.295
Nah, you can't be born a cowboy.

38:13.297 --> 38:16.331
Sure you can, my daddy and my
grand-daddy both were cowboys.

38:18.834 --> 38:20.835
My dad died.

38:27.943 --> 38:30.378
I'm so sorry to hear that.

38:34.083 --> 38:37.452
You know we cowboys, we're
always moving forward.

38:37.454 --> 38:40.455
We never think about the past too much.

38:40.457 --> 38:43.091
'It's always about what's
over that next Ridge'

38:43.093 --> 38:46.094
or beyond that next canyon.

38:46.096 --> 38:47.929
Lookin' back never did much for me.

38:47.931 --> 38:49.931
I just keep looking forward.

38:49.933 --> 38:51.866
I don't worry about the past.

38:51.868 --> 38:53.335
That's a good idea

38:53.337 --> 38:55.970
but... I don't wanna forget my daddy.

38:55.972 --> 39:00.575
Oh, no, never forget your daddy.

39:00.577 --> 39:04.346
I just said don't worry
about the past too much.

39:04.348 --> 39:07.682
'Your daddy, he is safe up in heaven'

39:07.684 --> 39:09.951
and he's looking down on you right now.

39:09.953 --> 39:12.053
He's watching everything you do.

39:12.055 --> 39:14.823
Now, what you need to do

39:14.825 --> 39:19.494
you need to be brave and
just keep moving forward

39:19.496 --> 39:20.829
like a cowboy.

39:23.399 --> 39:26.501
So..

39:26.503 --> 39:29.137
How can I become a cowboy?

39:29.139 --> 39:32.640
- Well, I could teach you.
- You can?

39:32.642 --> 39:35.710
- 'Sure.' - Don't you need a horse?

39:35.712 --> 39:38.146
Nah, you don't need a horse
to learn how to ride a horse.

39:38.148 --> 39:39.514
- You don't?
- No.

39:39.516 --> 39:41.583
In fact, one of the best ways to learn

39:41.585 --> 39:44.152
is to practice riding on
a, a barrel or something.

39:44.154 --> 39:46.921
Um, can we play cowboys after dinner?

39:46.923 --> 39:48.957
We don't have any barrels.

39:50.693 --> 39:52.394
You know what, I've got an idea.

39:53.896 --> 39:56.131
'Okay, take the reins. There you go.'

39:56.133 --> 39:58.099
'now just kick in with
your heels a little bit.'

39:58.101 --> 40:00.935
really gently, make him go,
make him walk, that's it.

40:00.937 --> 40:02.570
That's it.

40:02.572 --> 40:05.006
There you go, now, make
him go a little faster.

40:05.008 --> 40:06.941
That's it, kick him. There
you go, there you go.

40:06.943 --> 40:08.643
Hold those reins out there.

40:08.645 --> 40:09.911
Great, perfect, good job.

40:09.913 --> 40:11.946
Kick him, make him run. Make him go.

40:11.948 --> 40:14.682
Little faster, little faster.

40:14.684 --> 40:18.853
Okay, make him stop, whoa,
whoa, easy, really easy.

40:18.855 --> 40:20.789
You're gonna be ready for a real horse.

40:20.791 --> 40:23.491
- He's a natural.
- You are. Cowboy, it's bedtime.

40:25.461 --> 40:27.996
- Come on.
- Alright, come on, bedtime.

40:29.799 --> 40:31.699
- Oh.
- Thanks, Travis.

40:31.701 --> 40:35.703
Oh, hey, you're welcome, buddy.
Great job riding that horse.

40:35.705 --> 40:37.972
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

40:40.142 --> 40:41.543
Come on.

40:43.746 --> 40:46.514
- Hmm.
- Yeah? Just does a good job.

40:46.516 --> 40:48.783
Keep your socks on.

40:48.785 --> 40:49.951
- 'Right?' - 'Okay.'

40:52.755 --> 40:54.823
come on, hop in the bed.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.168
- I like the cowboy.
- You do?

41:07.170 --> 41:10.939
Yeah, he's really cool.
Not because he's a cowboy

41:10.941 --> 41:13.675
but he's just really nice.

41:15.077 --> 41:17.512
He is. And he liked you too.

41:17.514 --> 41:19.914
And he said you'd make a great cowboy.

41:19.916 --> 41:22.784
- Really?
- Mm-hm, he told me so.

41:22.786 --> 41:27.489
- Can we get a horse?
- Oh, the horse.

41:27.491 --> 41:29.924
This is not the right
property for a horse, baby.

41:29.926 --> 41:32.227
Well, we'd have to get a ranch, too.

41:32.229 --> 41:33.962
Oh, really?

41:33.964 --> 41:37.265
Then if we get a ranch, then
we can get tons of horses.

41:39.703 --> 41:41.769
I'll tell you what, let's just
take it one step at a time.

41:41.771 --> 41:44.138
Maybe we'll start with some cowboy boots.

41:44.140 --> 41:46.641
Okay.

41:46.643 --> 41:48.176
I love you.

41:50.513 --> 41:52.247
Sweet dreams.

42:55.344 --> 42:57.745
- 'Alright.' - 'Great. Alright.'

42:57.747 --> 42:59.781
- take his hand.
- He got my hand. Thank you.

42:59.783 --> 43:00.882
- Okay? There's a step.
- Okay.

43:00.884 --> 43:02.216
- Okay, just step.
- Ready?

43:02.218 --> 43:04.218
- Okay. Alright.
- Step.

43:04.220 --> 43:05.887
Okay.

43:05.889 --> 43:07.288
- There's another one.
- Step.

43:07.290 --> 43:09.757
- That's it. Another step.
- Step. Thank you.

43:09.759 --> 43:11.125
What are you guys doing?

43:11.127 --> 43:15.630
Step, step, step, step, step, step.

43:15.632 --> 43:17.098
- Space.
- Thank you.

43:17.100 --> 43:18.166
- And then step.
- Step.

43:18.168 --> 43:19.968
Oh, oh, okay.

43:23.305 --> 43:25.039
Alright.

43:25.041 --> 43:26.708
Alright, ready?

43:26.710 --> 43:30.311
It's a brand new..

43:30.313 --> 43:31.946
'Truck!'

43:31.948 --> 43:34.916
- what.. Are you kidding me?
- Happy birthday!

43:34.918 --> 43:36.884
That's amazing. Uh!

43:36.886 --> 43:38.186
It's got all the bells and whistles...

43:38.188 --> 43:40.989
wow! I-i-i don't even know what to say.

43:40.991 --> 43:42.290
You don't have to say anything.

43:42.292 --> 43:44.158
- Expression says it all.
- Thank you.

43:44.160 --> 43:47.261
Thank you, buddy. So cool.

43:47.263 --> 43:49.030
So let's go for a ride. I
have one more surprise.

43:49.032 --> 43:51.065
Yes. Another surprise.

43:51.067 --> 43:52.233
Let's go.

44:45.454 --> 44:47.689
- Hello.
- Hi.

44:47.691 --> 44:49.857
- Barbara, how are you?
- I am doing great.

44:49.859 --> 44:52.293
'I received all the papers
signed from your lawyer today.'

44:52.295 --> 44:53.861
- fantastic.
- Is it ours?

44:53.863 --> 44:56.197
Yes, it's officially all yours.

44:56.199 --> 44:58.966
- Hey!
- Congratulations.

44:58.968 --> 45:01.402
Wait, we have one more surprise.

45:01.404 --> 45:03.805
- Yay.
- Yes, hang on.

45:03.807 --> 45:05.707
- Close your eyes.
- We're gonna put this on you.

45:05.709 --> 45:05.707
- Okay.

45:05.709 --> 45:07.341
- Okay.
- So.. 'Can you see?'

45:07.343 --> 45:08.776
- no.
- 'You sure?'

45:08.778 --> 45:10.111
- yes.
- 'Okay.'

45:10.113 --> 45:11.779
- no peeking.
- You're welcome.

45:11.781 --> 45:13.114
- Enjoy. Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

45:13.116 --> 45:15.817
Bye.

45:15.819 --> 45:17.418
What is it? What is it? I can't wait.

45:17.420 --> 45:20.354
We're almost there. Hang on, hang on. Okay.

45:20.356 --> 45:21.789
- Okay.
- Turn around.

45:21.791 --> 45:23.124
- Okay.
- I'm gonna take this off.

45:23.126 --> 45:24.826
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

45:24.828 --> 45:26.094
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Here we go.

45:28.197 --> 45:29.997
- A horse?
- Yeah.

45:29.999 --> 45:32.333
'What? You bought me a horse!'

45:32.335 --> 45:34.035
'we sure did. What do you think?'

45:34.037 --> 45:36.904
you guys are the greatest
parents of all time.

45:36.906 --> 45:39.440
Okay. What do you wanna name him?

45:39.442 --> 45:42.210
I wanna name him, cowboy.

45:42.212 --> 45:44.345
You wanna name your horse, cowboy?

45:44.347 --> 45:46.347
- Sure. Why not?
- I think it's sweet.

45:46.349 --> 45:48.116
I like it. I like it.

45:48.118 --> 45:49.917
Okay, cowboy it is.

45:49.919 --> 45:51.919
Can I ride him?

46:18.881 --> 46:20.948
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:23.252 --> 46:26.254
Something wrong? You're
looking very serious.

46:26.256 --> 46:28.856
Nah. I'm okay.

46:30.392 --> 46:32.160
You're sure?

46:33.162 --> 46:35.496
Yeah. N-n-nothing.

46:35.498 --> 46:37.799
You're my husband, you're
supposed to be able to talk

46:37.801 --> 46:40.334
to me about these things. What's going on?

46:40.336 --> 46:41.836
Okay.

46:41.838 --> 46:43.404
Can I be completely honest with you?

46:43.406 --> 46:46.240
Please.

46:46.242 --> 46:48.943
Sometimes..

46:48.945 --> 46:50.912
It's hard being your husband.

46:50.914 --> 46:53.047
I don't know what that means.

46:53.049 --> 46:55.149
I don't work, I don't bring home any money

46:55.151 --> 46:58.152
I don't... Provide anything
for you and Tyler.

46:58.154 --> 46:59.821
I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh

46:59.823 --> 47:02.990
but... Bill left me with more money

47:02.992 --> 47:06.260
than I will ever know what to do with.

47:06.262 --> 47:09.197
Grandchildren will be set
and our grandchildren's

47:09.199 --> 47:11.399
grandchildren will be set.

47:11.401 --> 47:16.270
I-I-i understand all
that but I still feel..

47:16.272 --> 47:17.471
Sort of useless.

47:17.473 --> 47:21.509
Honey... What you give, Tyler and I

47:21.511 --> 47:23.311
is something money cannot buy.

47:23.313 --> 47:25.046
You give us love.

47:25.048 --> 47:27.114
I mean, I'm able to breathe again.

47:31.453 --> 47:34.088
It makes me uncomfortable
to ask you for money.

47:35.891 --> 47:38.192
Okay.

47:38.194 --> 47:40.928
I'll open up a bank account.
It'll be yours.

47:40.930 --> 47:42.430
You can get the money
out any time you want.

47:44.200 --> 47:46.234
Sound good?

47:46.236 --> 47:48.336
I don't know.

47:48.338 --> 47:50.204
Uh, I didn't realize

47:50.206 --> 47:52.640
that you were feeling insecure about it.

47:52.642 --> 47:55.176
Hey, but don't worry about money.

47:55.178 --> 47:57.211
I'm not.

47:57.213 --> 47:59.513
If I was, I would've had
you sign a pre-nup.

47:59.515 --> 48:01.315
Right? So..

48:01.317 --> 48:03.317
- I guess that's true.
- Okay.

48:03.319 --> 48:05.920
So then, it's the end of discussion.

48:05.922 --> 48:08.522
You're rich. Deal with it.

48:08.524 --> 48:12.260
Look... Bill worked really hard

48:12.262 --> 48:13.995
to make sure Tyler and I were happy

48:13.997 --> 48:16.230
and you've made us the
happiest since he's passed.

48:16.232 --> 48:20.468
So let's just enjoy the
fruits of his labor. Okay?

48:24.339 --> 48:26.674
You are amazing.

48:26.676 --> 48:29.110
No, you are amazing.

48:36.018 --> 48:38.653
- Okay?
- Okay.

48:38.655 --> 48:40.588
Okay.

48:46.995 --> 48:48.930
See you later, mom.

48:49.598 --> 48:51.632
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

48:51.634 --> 48:53.501
No hugs and kisses for me?

48:53.503 --> 48:55.102
I mean, what?

48:56.705 --> 48:58.973
- You guys be safe.
- Okay.

48:58.975 --> 49:00.675
- Alright.
- We will.

49:00.677 --> 49:02.443
Uh, eh, be safe in the water.

49:02.445 --> 49:03.711
I will watch him like a hawk.

49:03.713 --> 49:06.714
I'm not talking to him, I'm talking to you.

49:06.716 --> 49:08.282
Have you seen him swim?

49:08.284 --> 49:09.583
He's like a kangaroo, treading water.

49:09.585 --> 49:11.619
- What?
- That is funny.

49:11.621 --> 49:13.554
Very funny, you guys.

49:13.556 --> 49:15.089
Alright.

49:17.426 --> 49:19.193
Here. There you go.

49:19.195 --> 49:22.330
- Alright.
- Buckle up, okay?

49:22.332 --> 49:23.631
And wear your life jacket.

49:23.633 --> 49:25.566
Please, okay?

49:28.070 --> 49:30.438
- Don't worry about us.
- Of course, I'll worry.

49:30.440 --> 49:31.973
- Love you.
- Bye-bye. Love you, too.

50:12.614 --> 50:15.216
- Hi, Elizabeth Goodhart?
- Yes.

50:15.218 --> 50:16.650
Hi, I'm detective Morrison

50:16.652 --> 50:18.285
with the Phoenix police department.

50:18.287 --> 50:21.022
- Phoenix?
- Yes, Ma'am.

50:21.024 --> 50:23.457
I-I was the lead detective
in your husband's case

50:23.459 --> 50:25.526
when he, when he passed away.

50:27.029 --> 50:28.162
U-uh, of course.

50:28.164 --> 50:29.597
Detective Morrison, how-how are you?

50:29.599 --> 50:31.365
I'm sorry to disturb you like this

50:31.367 --> 50:33.467
but is, uh, Mr. brown here?

50:33.469 --> 50:35.569
Uh, no. No. He left a few minutes ago.

50:35.571 --> 50:37.605
Can I help you?

50:37.607 --> 50:40.174
Yes, uh, do you mind if
I come in for a moment?

50:41.343 --> 50:43.577
- Sure.
- Thanks.

50:45.180 --> 50:48.215
Uh... So Phoenix.

50:48.217 --> 50:50.217
Why, you come quite a distance?

50:50.219 --> 50:51.819
Must be pretty important.

50:51.821 --> 50:55.056
Well, I assume folks of my
department found some evidence

50:55.058 --> 50:57.425
that might suggest that
your husband's passing

50:57.427 --> 51:00.361
may not have been entirely an accident.

51:01.229 --> 51:02.696
What kind of evidence?

51:02.698 --> 51:04.765
Well, there was another
detective investigating

51:04.767 --> 51:06.834
a homicide case just outside of Phoenix

51:06.836 --> 51:09.336
and he got a DNA match

51:09.338 --> 51:12.306
uh, to Mr. brown.

51:12.308 --> 51:15.543
So naturally, we, we reopened
your husband's case.

51:15.545 --> 51:16.844
But why?

51:16.846 --> 51:18.512
Because Mr. brown was the first person

51:18.514 --> 51:20.681
to find your husband after
he fell off the horse.

51:20.683 --> 51:23.417
Yeah, that's right, Travis did everything

51:23.419 --> 51:25.119
he could, he, he did everything right.

51:25.121 --> 51:28.489
Your husband's injuries
aren't entirely consistent

51:28.491 --> 51:31.625
with the type of accident
that he apparently had.

51:32.494 --> 51:33.727
Apparently?

51:33.729 --> 51:35.596
Apparently, he fell off his horse

51:35.598 --> 51:37.198
and hit his head.

51:37.200 --> 51:40.768
Yes, and he had two head injuries.

51:40.770 --> 51:43.804
- I guess he hit his head twice.
- Right. That's what we thought.

51:43.806 --> 51:45.806
But the injuries that were
on the top of the skull

51:45.808 --> 51:49.410
were consistent with, uh
The speed of the horse

51:49.412 --> 51:50.878
falling off the horse, hitting a tree

51:50.880 --> 51:53.814
but the injuries on his frontal
lobe but more consistent

51:53.816 --> 51:55.483
with, uh..

51:55.485 --> 51:57.785
Well, with, with blunt force trauma.

51:59.187 --> 52:00.621
I.. Detective, I'm sorry

52:00.623 --> 52:02.289
I-I don't know what you're
trying to say here.

52:02.291 --> 52:03.757
Uh, we're not ruling out foul play.

52:03.759 --> 52:07.428
We've reopened the case
as a potential homicide.

52:07.430 --> 52:12.466
And, uh, Mr. brown is
our number one suspect.

52:12.468 --> 52:14.568
No.

52:14.570 --> 52:16.704
That's-that's crazy.

52:16.706 --> 52:19.540
Uh.. U-uh, Travis was there.
He, he helped bill.

52:19.542 --> 52:22.376
He did everything he could to help bill.
I.. We've already been through this.

52:22.378 --> 52:24.845
I've been investigating
this case for a long time.

52:24.847 --> 52:27.648
It wasn't until I found out
about the skull anomalies

52:27.650 --> 52:28.883
that I figured it was a good idea

52:28.885 --> 52:31.785
to come talk to you in person.

52:31.787 --> 52:33.754
How well do you know Mr. brown?

52:33.756 --> 52:35.689
Please, he's my husband.

52:35.691 --> 52:37.758
Did you know that he was in the air force?

52:39.794 --> 52:42.263
No. I..

52:42.265 --> 52:43.531
He was a fighter pilot.

52:43.533 --> 52:45.266
He was discharged from the air force

52:45.268 --> 52:47.201
for insubordination.

52:47.203 --> 52:49.170
That's ridiculous. Okay?

52:49.172 --> 52:51.438
My husband is afraid to fly.

52:51.440 --> 52:54.642
And I promise you, Travis had
nothing to do with bill's death.

52:54.644 --> 52:57.878
So if I'm not a suspect, I'd
like you to leave my house.

53:00.182 --> 53:01.582
Good.

53:02.751 --> 53:04.585
May I suggest you, don't tell Mr. brown

53:04.587 --> 53:06.320
that I was here.

53:08.323 --> 53:10.257
You call me anytime.

53:22.971 --> 53:24.705
'So how you're doing?'

53:24.707 --> 53:27.208
- 'good.' - 'Yeah?'

53:27.210 --> 53:29.643
you know, fishing all about Patience.

53:29.645 --> 53:31.946
Yeah. But I'm a kid.

53:31.948 --> 53:34.448
Kids don't have Patience.

53:34.450 --> 53:36.817
Well, you'll need Patience
when you're my age.

53:36.819 --> 53:38.552
So I guess you need to start practicing.

53:38.554 --> 53:40.955
It's like a, it's like a life lesson.

53:42.891 --> 53:44.825
I think I got one.

53:44.827 --> 53:47.294
Okay, hang-hang on. Just a sec.

53:47.296 --> 53:49.330
Okay, now, remember how I told
you to give it a little tug?

53:49.332 --> 53:51.432
Right now, give it a little tug.
There, there, that's it.

53:51.434 --> 53:53.334
Show that fish who's Boss.
Think you have something.

53:53.336 --> 53:54.635
Hey, I think you might
have something there.

53:54.637 --> 53:55.903
Really slow, really slow, slow.

53:55.905 --> 53:57.705
- I do?
- Yeah. Yeah.

53:57.707 --> 53:59.773
You don't wanna lose this guy, okay?
Okay, yeah, there he is.

53:59.775 --> 54:01.842
No, I don't wanna lose..
Th.. Yeah, that's him!

54:01.844 --> 54:03.244
- Okay.
- Oh.

54:03.246 --> 54:04.511
- Alright.
- Yeah.

54:04.513 --> 54:05.779
- Look at that.
- We got him.

54:05.781 --> 54:07.014
We got him, man.

54:07.016 --> 54:09.250
- Good job. Give me five!
- Yeah.

54:09.252 --> 54:10.417
I couldn't have done it
without you, Travis.

54:10.419 --> 54:13.554
Oh, way to go. Way to go. Okay.

54:13.556 --> 54:15.289
Here, let's bring it back over here.

54:15.291 --> 54:17.424
Take this baby home and show mom, okay?

54:17.426 --> 54:19.426
- Alright!
- Alright.

54:19.428 --> 54:21.428
- I'll get the tackle box.
- Okay, can you get it?

54:21.430 --> 54:23.697
Yeah, I got it.

54:23.699 --> 54:25.266
- Alright.
- You're ready?

54:25.268 --> 54:27.868
- Yeah. Let's do it.
- Alright.

54:27.870 --> 54:29.703
Man, I can't believe you
caught your first fish.

54:29.705 --> 54:31.305
Yeah.

54:32.707 --> 54:34.008
'I know but why would the detective'

54:34.010 --> 54:36.510
'come all the way to Sonoma?'

54:36.512 --> 54:39.580
'they don't just open two year
old investigations for nothing.'

54:39.582 --> 54:42.750
'you're acting paranoid.'

54:42.752 --> 54:44.485
what if something had
happened, what if-what if

54:44.487 --> 54:45.552
bill was murdered I can't just igno...

54:46.555 --> 54:47.788
'oh, Elizabeth.'

54:47.790 --> 54:48.856
it's Travis. I gotta go.

54:50.825 --> 54:53.560
Hey, babe, um..

54:53.562 --> 54:55.396
I've been trying to reach
you, where are you?

54:55.398 --> 54:57.064
Sorry, there's no reception up there.

54:57.066 --> 54:59.433
Everything okay?

54:59.435 --> 55:01.735
Yeah. I just, um, I just miss you.
That's all.

55:01.737 --> 55:04.805
- 'Mom, I caught a fish.'
- That's great, babe.

55:04.807 --> 55:07.341
'He caught it all by himself.'

55:07.343 --> 55:09.943
good. Are you on the way back?

55:09.945 --> 55:12.546
Well, we're going to stop
and grab a bite to eat.

55:14.316 --> 55:16.717
- 'No.' - No?

55:16.719 --> 55:18.819
I-I just want you to come home.

55:18.821 --> 55:21.955
Travis was going to take me
for a burger and a shake.

55:21.957 --> 55:24.692
'Can you tell Travis that
I really want you guys'

55:24.694 --> 55:26.694
to come back, I wanna cook supper and..

55:26.696 --> 55:28.762
'Sure, babe. We'll be home in an hour.'

55:30.799 --> 55:33.701
okay, be safe. I-i love you, both.

55:35.537 --> 55:37.771
Okay. See ya.

56:08.136 --> 56:09.903
'Alright, buddy.'

56:11.439 --> 56:14.041
okay.

56:14.043 --> 56:15.609
Come on, kid. You wanna help me out?

56:15.611 --> 56:17.611
- Yeah.
- Alright. Hop out.

56:17.613 --> 56:19.446
- You need to get the stuff, okay. Come on.
- Okay.

56:19.448 --> 56:20.781
- Alright. Ugh!

56:20.783 --> 56:22.916
'Wee! Oh.'

56:22.918 --> 56:25.486
- 'I stepped on the net. Okay..'
- Alright. Here we go.

56:25.488 --> 56:26.720
Take that, hand me those.

56:26.722 --> 56:27.855
Here.

56:27.857 --> 56:29.923
Now, give me your prized possession.

56:32.994 --> 56:34.495
- Alright. Perfect.
- Aah!

56:36.432 --> 56:37.698
Good job. Okay. Come on.

56:37.700 --> 56:41.001
- Wee!
- Whoo!

56:41.003 --> 56:43.070
- Whoa! Okay.
- Alright.

56:43.072 --> 56:44.772
- What do you wanna take?
- Um..

56:44.774 --> 56:46.407
- Do you wanna take that?
- The fish?

56:46.409 --> 56:48.475
Yeah. You know what, you
take that, take this.

56:48.477 --> 56:50.511
- Okay. Okay.
- Let's go.

56:50.513 --> 56:51.912
Alright.

57:03.691 --> 57:05.759
Alright. Come on, buddy.

57:05.761 --> 57:07.161
Okay.

57:10.131 --> 57:12.666
Mom! We're home.

57:12.668 --> 57:14.868
Liz! Where are you?

57:15.703 --> 57:18.705
Hey, you're here. Hi.

57:18.707 --> 57:20.474
Hey, babe.

57:23.077 --> 57:24.745
Oh.

57:29.484 --> 57:31.919
Hey, how was it?

57:31.921 --> 57:33.987
I caught a fish.

57:37.492 --> 57:39.493
- This is its fin.
- Yeah?

57:39.495 --> 57:41.895
Uh, that's beautiful. That is.. It's..

57:43.131 --> 57:44.998
You're alright, Liz?

57:45.000 --> 57:47.468
Yeah. I'm just, um..

57:47.470 --> 57:49.536
Just a little tired, that's all.

57:51.473 --> 57:54.141
Mm. Well, smells great.

57:54.143 --> 57:55.909
Can't wait for dinner.

57:55.911 --> 57:58.879
Um, you know, uh, you've
had really long day.

57:58.881 --> 58:00.481
Why-why don't you go get cleaned up.

58:00.483 --> 58:02.983
And, Tyler, you can help me set the table.

58:02.985 --> 58:04.485
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

58:04.487 --> 58:06.553
'Okay.'

58:08.790 --> 58:10.190
come on.

58:14.229 --> 58:17.498
Travis says that we can make
a fishing pond on the ranch.

58:17.500 --> 58:20.567
Could we do that, mom?
I really like fishing.

58:20.569 --> 58:23.170
Yeah. It sounds like a good idea.

58:23.172 --> 58:24.905
So you guys had fun today?

58:24.907 --> 58:27.975
Yeah, Travis taught me lots of cool stuff.

58:27.977 --> 58:29.643
'He taught me how to make a lure'

58:29.645 --> 58:31.278
'and then how to put it on the hook.'

58:31.280 --> 58:33.080
'and then he taught me all of the parts'

58:33.082 --> 58:34.848
'of the fishing rod.'

58:36.985 --> 58:38.752
are you okay?

58:40.021 --> 58:42.956
Yeah. Um... Sure.

58:43.558 --> 58:44.925
I think, I..

58:44.927 --> 58:46.026
You guys go get ready for bed

58:46.028 --> 58:48.262
and I'll, um, I'll clean up.

58:50.064 --> 58:51.532
We're not done, mom.

58:51.534 --> 58:53.901
Tyler, I said go get ready for bed.

58:53.903 --> 58:55.202
Half his food is still on his plate.

58:55.204 --> 58:57.271
He's my son.

58:58.673 --> 59:00.741
I said dinner's over.

59:03.711 --> 59:06.880
Okay, Liz. Dinner's over.

59:06.882 --> 59:10.284
'Okay, I'll go brush my
teeth and put my PJâ€™s on.'

59:20.828 --> 59:22.663
you know, we had a great day today.

59:22.665 --> 59:25.098
He's really connecting with me.
Please don't ruin it.

59:27.936 --> 59:31.271
I'm sorry, I just, um..

59:31.273 --> 59:33.874
I had some bad news... Today.

59:33.876 --> 59:35.676
And I'm just trying to digest it.

59:35.678 --> 59:37.644
What bad news?

59:37.646 --> 59:39.980
A friend from high school passed away.

59:39.982 --> 59:42.749
I'm sorry. Why didn't you let me know?

59:42.751 --> 59:44.284
I should've told you since you walked in.

59:44.286 --> 59:46.587
It is my fault. Just..

59:46.589 --> 59:48.622
Go get ready for bed.

59:48.624 --> 59:51.925
Okay, I-i... I wanna clean up.

59:51.927 --> 59:53.360
A-a-are you sure, you're okay?

59:54.963 --> 59:57.230
- Definitely.
- I don't know.

59:57.232 --> 59:59.900
I'll see you up there.

01:00:55.323 --> 01:00:57.391
I'm sorry about your friend.

01:00:58.893 --> 01:01:00.861
There's just..

01:01:00.863 --> 01:01:03.196
Been so much loss lately.

01:01:05.767 --> 01:01:10.003
Like, you know, honey, I never..

01:01:10.005 --> 01:01:12.773
Asked about what
happened to your ex-wife.

01:01:15.343 --> 01:01:17.744
Well, she was driving

01:01:17.746 --> 01:01:21.682
on a windy... Mountain road.

01:01:21.684 --> 01:01:24.351
And evidently..

01:01:24.353 --> 01:01:27.421
Her brakes went out and she..

01:01:27.423 --> 01:01:29.356
Went off a cliff.

01:01:30.892 --> 01:01:33.126
It's terrible. I'm so sorry.

01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:37.297
Then?

01:01:37.299 --> 01:01:40.901
Yeah, I got one of those
calls, late one night.

01:01:40.903 --> 01:01:44.304
Uh, never wanna get one
of those calls again.

01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:50.977
Hey, if I'd know what happened..

01:01:53.047 --> 01:01:55.282
Like I said it was an accident.

01:02:00.188 --> 01:02:02.889
Did she, um..

01:02:02.891 --> 01:02:05.225
Have any enemies or anything?

01:02:05.227 --> 01:02:06.993
No. No.

01:02:06.995 --> 01:02:09.329
She was the sweetest girl.

01:02:09.331 --> 01:02:11.398
She never hurt a fly.

01:02:14.869 --> 01:02:17.504
I don't know, it was just
a, a tragic accident.

01:02:17.506 --> 01:02:19.272
That, that's it.

01:02:20.875 --> 01:02:22.909
But I don't wanna talk
about this stuff anymore.

01:02:24.212 --> 01:02:27.814
We have each other and that
all it matters, right?

01:02:28.983 --> 01:02:30.751
That's right.

01:02:31.319 --> 01:02:33.253
Let's get some sleep.

01:02:34.088 --> 01:02:35.789
Okay. Goodnight.

01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:37.858
Goodnight. Love you.

01:02:40.027 --> 01:02:41.795
I love you too.

01:04:10.885 --> 01:04:12.853
- Babe.
- Um.

01:04:12.855 --> 01:04:14.354
- Baby, come.
- Why?

01:04:14.356 --> 01:04:17.090
Come on. Ugh!

01:04:17.092 --> 01:04:19.492
Shh. Keep sleeping.

01:04:19.494 --> 01:04:21.228
Shh. Shh. Shh.

01:04:26.534 --> 01:04:29.069
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

01:04:44.552 --> 01:04:46.486
Shh. Shh. Shh.

01:04:47.421 --> 01:04:49.422
Shh.

01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:16.917
Going somewhere?

01:05:16.919 --> 01:05:19.419
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm just, um..

01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:22.155
I'm gonna go to my sister's.

01:05:22.157 --> 01:05:23.957
And why would you do that?

01:05:23.959 --> 01:05:26.660
Because I'm sad about my
friend and I, and I just, um..

01:05:26.662 --> 01:05:29.162
She, she told me to come
over, something to talk.

01:05:30.531 --> 01:05:33.166
With Tyler?

01:05:33.168 --> 01:05:35.568
Yeah. Yeah, with Tyler.

01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:39.172
Why did you ask me about my first wife?

01:05:39.174 --> 01:05:42.008
What? Oh. What does that...

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:44.611
I just wanna know why you brought it up?

01:05:44.613 --> 01:05:46.713
Who you've been talking to?

01:05:46.715 --> 01:05:49.983
Nobody. Nobody, I, I don..

01:05:49.985 --> 01:05:52.052
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:05:57.391 --> 01:05:59.459
Where'd you get this?

01:06:03.331 --> 01:06:07.267
Detective... Came here
while you were fishing.

01:06:09.136 --> 01:06:11.004
And what did he tell you?

01:06:12.206 --> 01:06:15.542
He said that, um, you may have had..

01:06:15.544 --> 01:06:18.345
Something to do..

01:06:18.347 --> 01:06:20.146
With bill's death.

01:06:21.515 --> 01:06:23.383
And why would he think that?

01:06:25.219 --> 01:06:27.620
Maybe, um, maybe the money..

01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:31.624
I don't need your money.

01:06:31.626 --> 01:06:34.461
I've been poor before, I can be poor again.

01:06:34.463 --> 01:06:36.429
Hey, it's my fault.

01:06:36.431 --> 01:06:40.266
Okay, I, I, I think that, um,
the detective just scared me

01:06:40.268 --> 01:06:43.169
just made me feel a little... Paranoid.

01:06:43.171 --> 01:06:46.272
And, uh, I, I think we
should just go inside

01:06:46.274 --> 01:06:49.476
and forget all about this. Okay?

01:06:49.478 --> 01:06:52.045
I'm sorry.

01:06:52.047 --> 01:06:53.380
Let's go for a drive.

01:06:53.382 --> 01:06:55.115
Babe, please, let's take Tyler

01:06:55.117 --> 01:06:56.149
and let's just, let's just...

01:06:56.151 --> 01:06:59.052
let's go... For a drive.

01:06:59.054 --> 01:07:00.286
I need to think.

01:07:28.616 --> 01:07:30.550
You look nervous.

01:07:31.685 --> 01:07:33.620
You're scaring me.

01:07:38.092 --> 01:07:40.660
'I'm your husband. You
don't need to be nervous.'

01:07:42.263 --> 01:07:44.330
I've just never seen you like this.

01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:49.269
You're doing good. Just keep driving.

01:07:49.271 --> 01:07:53.339
I... I get your point. Okay?

01:07:53.341 --> 01:07:57.110
I'm sorry. I, I.. Let's
just turn back. Okay?

01:07:57.112 --> 01:08:00.480
I want you to pull into the next turn-out.

01:08:00.482 --> 01:08:02.715
Why? There's nothing out there.

01:08:02.717 --> 01:08:03.783
It's just the top of the mountain.

01:08:03.785 --> 01:08:05.518
Pull into the next turn-out.

01:08:40.554 --> 01:08:42.322
Okay.

01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:44.791
Get out.

01:08:45.759 --> 01:08:48.194
'Get out of the car.'

01:09:09.582 --> 01:09:12.152
give me the keys.

01:09:12.154 --> 01:09:15.220
- What?
- Give me the keys.

01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:23.162
You're not acting like
the man that I married

01:09:23.165 --> 01:09:26.799
y-you're acting very strange, Travis.

01:09:26.801 --> 01:09:30.603
You accused me of killing bill,
why wouldn't I act strange?

01:09:30.604 --> 01:09:33.640
I didn't accuse you. The
detective accused you.

01:09:33.642 --> 01:09:35.241
I, I wasn't even gonna bring it up.

01:09:35.243 --> 01:09:36.542
Oh, but you were going to take Tyler

01:09:36.545 --> 01:09:38.745
and leave in the middle of the night?

01:09:38.747 --> 01:09:41.714
Yeah, I told you, I, I
was sad about my friend.

01:09:41.716 --> 01:09:43.383
I just wanna take out to my sister's.
That's it.

01:09:43.385 --> 01:09:45.952
Will you stop lying to me!

01:09:48.421 --> 01:09:50.189
I'm not lying.

01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:56.329
I'm not... I'm not lying to..

01:09:56.331 --> 01:09:59.432
- I think it's time.
- It's time, time for what?

01:09:59.434 --> 01:10:01.501
Time for you to know the truth.

01:10:02.436 --> 01:10:03.836
The truth about what?

01:10:03.838 --> 01:10:05.772
About me.

01:10:05.774 --> 01:10:07.840
There's no turning back now.

01:10:10.444 --> 01:10:14.914
I don't care about your past.

01:10:14.916 --> 01:10:18.785
I, I don't, okay. I, I just wanna go home.

01:10:18.787 --> 01:10:20.753
Let's go get back in bed. Okay.

01:10:20.755 --> 01:10:23.790
I'm.. I love you and I'm sorry.

01:10:23.792 --> 01:10:26.259
I'm sorry about all this, okay?

01:10:26.261 --> 01:10:28.661
Let's just go home. Okay?

01:10:31.298 --> 01:10:33.366
You know, sadly, Liz..

01:10:35.502 --> 01:10:37.503
I don't love you.

01:10:40.307 --> 01:10:43.376
Any guy could really go
for someone like you.

01:10:46.914 --> 01:10:49.282
I see your type.

01:10:49.284 --> 01:10:52.986
Coming up in their limousines
and their-their fancy cars.

01:10:52.988 --> 01:10:55.588
Diamond earrings and expensive watches

01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:58.791
looking down your noses at the rest of us.

01:10:58.793 --> 01:11:00.693
But I, I'm not like that.

01:11:00.695 --> 01:11:03.296
You, you know it, I, I'm not like that.

01:11:03.298 --> 01:11:05.531
But this time..

01:11:05.533 --> 01:11:07.467
I turn the tables.

01:11:08.736 --> 01:11:10.436
But what does, what does that mean?

01:11:10.438 --> 01:11:13.273
I mean, you fell for it, Liz.

01:11:13.275 --> 01:11:16.342
Hook, line and sinker.

01:11:18.579 --> 01:11:20.513
You really think I was
going to go to a rodeo

01:11:20.515 --> 01:11:23.049
in the everglades?

01:11:23.051 --> 01:11:25.885
- I'm going to a rodeo.
- 'Um, in Miami?'

01:11:25.887 --> 01:11:28.655
oh, not in Miami, a
little bit east of there.

01:11:30.424 --> 01:11:32.625
You really think that I'm afraid of flying

01:11:32.627 --> 01:11:34.627
I was in the freaking air
force, for god sake!

01:11:34.629 --> 01:11:36.562
He was a fighter pilot.

01:11:36.564 --> 01:11:39.365
He was discharged from the air
force for insubordination.

01:11:39.367 --> 01:11:42.769
Well, my husband is afraid to fly.

01:11:42.771 --> 01:11:44.537
What was that?

01:11:44.539 --> 01:11:47.440
I flew fighter jets, how could
I'd be afraid of flying?

01:11:47.442 --> 01:11:49.008
You're so stupid.

01:11:57.751 --> 01:12:00.053
What did you do..

01:12:00.055 --> 01:12:03.323
What did you do to bill? Huh?

01:12:03.325 --> 01:12:06.326
What did you do?

01:12:06.328 --> 01:12:08.027
You really wanna know?

01:12:08.029 --> 01:12:10.396
You really wanna know what I did to bill?

01:12:10.398 --> 01:12:12.899
Yeah. I do.

01:12:12.901 --> 01:12:15.368
Okay, listen up.

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:17.437
When I got to bill, he was in bad shape.

01:12:19.973 --> 01:12:22.542
Dammit! Mr. Goodhart!

01:12:22.544 --> 01:12:24.610
Mr. Goodhart, are you okay?

01:12:27.648 --> 01:12:28.915
I actually felt bad for the guy

01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:31.384
but then I..

01:12:31.386 --> 01:12:33.820
I remembered, how you looked at me.

01:12:38.892 --> 01:12:41.961
And this idea just did came into my head.

01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:44.464
Just like that.

01:12:45.699 --> 01:12:47.700
<i>And I just looked down and coincidentally</i>

01:12:47.702 --> 01:12:50.103
<i>there was a rock right at my foot.</i>

01:12:50.105 --> 01:12:51.871
<i>So I picked it up.</i>

01:12:53.907 --> 01:12:55.975
Home run.

01:13:01.749 --> 01:13:04.083
Oh, my god.

01:13:04.085 --> 01:13:05.852
Yeah.

01:13:05.854 --> 01:13:07.387
Oh, my god.

01:13:07.389 --> 01:13:09.422
But don't worry, I don't
think he felt a thing.

01:13:14.561 --> 01:13:16.162
That's what happened.

01:13:16.164 --> 01:13:19.866
You... Are very sick.

01:13:20.901 --> 01:13:22.969
Don't you have a conscience?

01:13:25.506 --> 01:13:27.507
What about Tyler?

01:13:27.509 --> 01:13:31.110
- What about him?
- Don't, don't you love him?

01:13:31.112 --> 01:13:32.745
See, you're not getting it, Liz.

01:13:34.415 --> 01:13:36.516
Uh, he's a nice kid and all but love him?

01:13:36.518 --> 01:13:37.917
Come on.

01:13:39.753 --> 01:13:41.821
W-where do you, where you're going?

01:13:48.695 --> 01:13:51.464
Why?

01:13:51.466 --> 01:13:52.865
Why did you do it?

01:13:54.635 --> 01:13:57.036
What would make you kill his father?

01:14:03.644 --> 01:14:05.711
I did it for the money, Liz.

01:14:07.481 --> 01:14:09.782
Just like your detective friend said.

01:14:09.784 --> 01:14:12.051
And now I have it.

01:14:12.053 --> 01:14:14.187
Because you didn't even
make me sign a pre-nup.

01:14:14.189 --> 01:14:16.622
Oh, my god.

01:14:22.663 --> 01:14:24.230
Turn around.

01:14:25.666 --> 01:14:27.099
No.

01:14:29.002 --> 01:14:30.970
Please, Travis, please.

01:14:30.972 --> 01:14:32.538
- Turn around.
- Let's just forget about this.

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.540
Turn around!

01:14:34.542 --> 01:14:36.976
Please. Travis, let's
just forget about this.

01:14:36.978 --> 01:14:40.213
Okay, please. No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:14:40.215 --> 01:14:44.150
Please. I won't tell anyone, I promise you.

01:14:44.152 --> 01:14:47.186
It'll be, it'll be our secret.
We can go back home.

01:14:47.188 --> 01:14:49.121
Please, let's just take another home.

01:14:49.123 --> 01:14:52.925
- Don't move..
- Please.

01:14:52.927 --> 01:14:54.994
A muscle.

01:14:54.996 --> 01:14:57.129
Or I will kill your son.

01:14:57.131 --> 01:15:01.133
Did you hear me? Don't move a muscle.

01:15:05.873 --> 01:15:08.808
No. No, no, no, no, please.

01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:10.142
Please, stop.

01:15:10.144 --> 01:15:12.545
Oh, my god.

01:15:12.547 --> 01:15:13.746
Oh, my god.

01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:39.305
Please. Oh, my god!

01:15:39.307 --> 01:15:41.841
Oh, my god!

01:16:06.333 --> 01:16:08.100
Travis?

01:16:11.605 --> 01:16:13.172
Travis?

01:16:14.341 --> 01:16:16.108
Travis?

01:16:26.086 --> 01:16:27.620
Travis?

01:16:44.871 --> 01:16:46.772
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

01:16:46.774 --> 01:16:48.074
Oh, my god!

01:16:48.076 --> 01:16:51.210
Oh! Oh, my god!

01:17:25.178 --> 01:17:28.347
Mommy? Is everything okay?

01:17:28.349 --> 01:17:30.116
Everything's okay, baby. Okay?

01:17:30.118 --> 01:17:31.884
Everything's fine.

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:35.688
Put your seatbelt on.
Your seatbelt on, baby.

01:17:51.738 --> 01:17:53.039
Oh, my god!

01:17:53.041 --> 01:17:55.174
My brakes!

01:17:55.176 --> 01:17:56.842
Why're we going so fast?

01:18:00.881 --> 01:18:02.982
'Mommy!'

01:18:02.984 --> 01:18:05.284
'stop the car!'

01:18:05.286 --> 01:18:07.353
are we going to die?

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:11.757
What's going on?

01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:16.696
- Mommy?
- Take your seatbelt off.

01:18:16.698 --> 01:18:19.398
'Put your hand on the handle
and when I count to three'

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.834
I want you to open the
door and roll out, okay?

01:18:21.836 --> 01:18:23.402
'But I'll fall!'

01:18:25.005 --> 01:18:27.740
- ready?
- We're gonna get hurt.

01:18:27.742 --> 01:18:29.141
One..

01:18:30.744 --> 01:18:32.812
Two... Three!

01:18:43.323 --> 01:18:45.157
Tyler.

01:18:45.159 --> 01:18:47.393
Tyler! Tyler!

01:18:49.296 --> 01:18:51.063
Mommy!

01:19:01.908 --> 01:19:04.143
- Mommy!
- Tyler!

01:19:05.479 --> 01:19:07.379
- Are you okay, baby?
- Yeah.

01:19:07.381 --> 01:19:10.082
- Yeah? Are you sure?
- Hm-mm.

01:19:26.466 --> 01:19:28.067
- Babe.
- Honey.

01:19:28.069 --> 01:19:30.402
What're doin' out here? Is everything okay?

01:19:30.404 --> 01:19:32.138
Yeah, it's a long story.

01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:35.274
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

01:19:38.245 --> 01:19:41.013
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god!

01:19:41.015 --> 01:19:42.348
People should really check their brakes

01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:44.150
before they drive these mountain roads.

01:19:44.152 --> 01:19:46.485
I hope that wasn't a family.

01:19:46.487 --> 01:19:48.420
Yeah, that would be horrible.

01:19:48.422 --> 01:19:51.290
We should, we should call the police.

01:19:51.292 --> 01:19:52.992
There's no service up here. Come on.

01:19:52.994 --> 01:19:54.927
We'll call from down below. Let's go.

01:20:12.112 --> 01:20:14.413
You did so good, I'm so proud of you.

01:20:14.415 --> 01:20:15.481
I'm scared.

01:20:15.483 --> 01:20:17.183
Everything's gonna be fine now.

01:20:17.185 --> 01:20:18.517
How far do we have to walk?

01:20:18.519 --> 01:20:20.853
Honey, I don't know. Just keep walking.

01:20:35.836 --> 01:20:38.270
'Last night, about 20 miles from Winthrop'

01:20:38.272 --> 01:20:40.906
'Elizabeth Goodhart, owner
of Goodhart management'

01:20:40.908 --> 01:20:43.042
'and her son, Tyler Goodhart died..'

01:20:43.044 --> 01:20:44.610
Travis. Travis, wake up.

01:20:44.612 --> 01:20:46.178
Wake up. Look.

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.546
That's her, right?

01:20:47.548 --> 01:20:49.515
'Lost control of her vehicle and flew off'

01:20:49.517 --> 01:20:52.117
'the side of the road..'

01:20:52.119 --> 01:20:54.887
well, I thought that you said
that she was on a vacation.

01:20:57.390 --> 01:21:00.025
- Oh, my god!
- I guess I was wrong.

01:21:00.027 --> 01:21:02.094
This is terrible.

01:21:03.263 --> 01:21:06.332
Yeah. Terrible news.

01:21:08.335 --> 01:21:10.502
Terrible, terrible news.

01:21:10.504 --> 01:21:11.537
Terrible news.

01:21:15.276 --> 01:21:17.443
Are those sirens?

01:21:17.445 --> 01:21:19.545
'Why, why are there sirens here?'

01:21:19.547 --> 01:21:21.180
- Travis, what is going on?
- I know.

01:21:21.182 --> 01:21:22.481
Talk to me.

01:21:22.483 --> 01:21:24.016
Hang on, let me check.

01:21:31.157 --> 01:21:33.325
'Travis? What do you see?'

01:21:33.327 --> 01:21:35.094
'what's going on?'

01:21:38.198 --> 01:21:39.365
'Travis?'

01:21:45.305 --> 01:21:47.339
okay.

01:21:47.341 --> 01:21:48.908
Here's what we're going to do.

01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:50.643
Oh, no, there's no we if there's Cops here.

01:21:50.645 --> 01:21:52.678
I'm going to go out there..

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.414
And talk to them..

01:21:55.416 --> 01:21:58.951
And everything would be just fine.
Relax.

01:21:58.953 --> 01:22:00.152
What do you mean, everything will be..

01:22:00.154 --> 01:22:02.087
What is going on? Travis?

01:22:02.089 --> 01:22:03.656
Travis, you need to..

01:22:13.099 --> 01:22:15.634
- Travis brown?
- Yeah.

01:22:15.636 --> 01:22:18.137
- You're under arrest.
- For what?

01:22:18.139 --> 01:22:20.005
For the murder of Kayla Ann Shrier

01:22:20.007 --> 01:22:21.307
'bill Goodhart.'

01:22:21.309 --> 01:22:23.208
'the attempted murder of Elizabeth'

01:22:23.210 --> 01:22:25.144
'and Tyler Goodhart.'

01:22:41.261 --> 01:22:43.562
escort you to the car.

01:23:05.485 --> 01:23:07.086
Unfortunately, there's gonna be quite a few

01:23:07.088 --> 01:23:09.621
hearings in the future but..

01:23:09.623 --> 01:23:11.623
'...we'll try to keep
involvement to a minimum.'

01:23:11.625 --> 01:23:13.392
watch your head.

01:23:13.394 --> 01:23:15.461
'I don't care what I've to do.'

01:23:16.529 --> 01:23:18.597
I wanna watch him burn.

01:23:52.665 --> 01:23:55.100
Okay.

01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:03.108
I love you... Dad.

01:24:04.778 --> 01:24:06.578
I love you too, bill.

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.547
So sorry.

01:24:08.549 --> 01:24:10.649
I hope you got a real pretty horse

01:24:10.651 --> 01:24:12.384
up there in heaven.

01:24:14.421 --> 01:24:16.121
I know he does, babe.

01:24:33.773 --> 01:24:34.706
Come on.
