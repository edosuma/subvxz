00:36.139 --> 00:37.973
Oh my God, look.

00:41.139 --> 00:42.973
Oh my God, oh my God.

00:43.041 --> 00:44.407
Eww.

00:54.986 --> 00:56.854
Tracie honey, don't
look at that ok.

01:05.529 --> 01:06.930
That's so sad.

01:08.733 --> 01:10.134
Just call your mom, ok?

01:17.909 --> 01:19.643
Hello?

01:19.936 --> 01:20.936
Tracie?

01:20.961 --> 01:24.413
Look, we're all going to the panic room
with my dad in like thirty minutes.

01:24.481 --> 01:25.148
We have to be up there.

01:25.216 --> 01:25.884
What?

01:25.951 --> 01:27.253
Look, I don't know where
you are but you've

01:27.279 --> 01:28.610
got to tell your dad
he's got to turn around

01:28.653 --> 01:30.452
and you guys have to
get here now, ok?

01:30.520 --> 01:31.822
What are you talking about?

01:31.890 --> 01:33.090
Just trust me.

01:33.158 --> 01:35.025
You guys have to get here now.

01:35.093 --> 01:36.093
Perry?

01:36.094 --> 01:37.094
Perry?

01:37.128 --> 01:38.628
You just... Tracie?

01:38.696 --> 01:39.863
Tracie?

01:42.633 --> 01:43.633
Shit.

01:47.939 --> 01:49.039
What did he say, hun?

01:50.308 --> 01:52.409
I don't know he
was just ranting.

02:07.192 --> 02:08.292
What did he say?

02:08.359 --> 02:10.460
- Dad, I don't.
- I think something is wrong.

02:13.631 --> 02:15.699
Ok, here we go.

02:17.268 --> 02:18.668
We'll take the short cut home.

02:23.741 --> 02:24.741
Dad, look out!

02:30.614 --> 02:31.715
You ok baby?

02:31.782 --> 02:33.917
Yeah dad, I'm ok.

02:34.652 --> 02:35.719
Rachel, you alright?

02:35.786 --> 02:37.787
Yeah Mr. Jackson, I'm fine.

02:38.823 --> 02:40.257
That guy came out of nowhere.

02:40.325 --> 02:42.159
Oh my God Dad look over there.

02:44.262 --> 02:45.528
Honey call 911.

02:45.596 --> 02:46.596
Call 911!

02:46.932 --> 02:48.865
Dad, what do we do? Is he alive?

02:48.915 --> 02:50.875
Tracy, stay there.
Stay there honey.

02:53.905 --> 02:56.039
Oh, oh my God.

03:00.011 --> 03:01.644
Where's the rest of him?

03:05.917 --> 03:06.984
Honey, did you call?

03:07.051 --> 03:09.186
Yeah I just got the
recording again.

03:27.305 --> 03:28.705
Dad, look over there!

03:28.907 --> 03:29.907
Rachel!

03:30.008 --> 03:31.041
Rachel!

03:36.915 --> 03:38.815
Rachel! Rachel come back!

03:40.651 --> 03:41.818
Rachel!

03:41.886 --> 03:43.727
Tracie, get the flashlight
from the car honey.

03:43.955 --> 03:44.955
Rachel!

03:45.023 --> 03:47.324
- Rachel, where are you?
- What is happening?

03:47.392 --> 03:48.926
I don't know baby, I don't know.

03:51.429 --> 03:52.629
There she is.

03:55.800 --> 03:56.833
Oh my God.

03:58.836 --> 03:59.903
That is not her.

04:01.339 --> 04:03.240
Dad, who are these people?

04:11.249 --> 04:15.785
Ah, dad is that a hand?

04:19.023 --> 04:20.223
He's alive.

04:21.725 --> 04:23.445
Get back honey. Get back.

04:30.435 --> 04:31.601
He's got friends.

04:40.711 --> 04:41.945
How's that possible?

04:43.714 --> 04:44.714
Dad?

04:47.218 --> 04:48.218
Dad?

04:49.753 --> 04:50.753
Dad?

04:52.423 --> 04:53.623
Dad!

04:57.128 --> 05:01.298
Come on baby we got to go. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

05:08.906 --> 05:12.976
In an area of elevated virus
activity, be prepared to evacuate

05:13.044 --> 05:17.080
your home for shelter at the
order of local authorities.

05:17.148 --> 05:21.985
If suspicions of persons exhibiting signs
of infections, report these individuals...

05:35.409 --> 05:36.409
Hey, hey!

05:36.434 --> 05:37.800
Freeze! Freeze!

05:38.369 --> 05:39.369
Don't move.

05:41.939 --> 05:43.173
Ten six seven...

05:43.241 --> 05:45.175
all officers to the station.

05:45.243 --> 05:46.843
Ten six seven.

05:46.911 --> 05:47.944
Hang on! Freeze or I'll shoot!

05:48.012 --> 05:49.346
Stop! Stop!

05:49.414 --> 05:50.213
Urgent!

05:50.281 --> 05:51.748
Ten six seven.

05:52.783 --> 05:54.918
All officers to the station.

05:55.553 --> 05:56.686
Urgent.

07:12.196 --> 07:14.030
Dad. Dad!

07:16.033 --> 07:17.553
You see that light
in the distance?

07:17.972 --> 07:19.612
We're going to run
towards that light, ok?

07:19.637 --> 07:21.004
Just follow daddy.

07:21.071 --> 07:22.071
Ok.

07:23.107 --> 07:24.107
Dad wait!

07:52.236 --> 07:53.470
Dad, what about Rachel?

08:01.445 --> 08:03.913
Shh, be quiet. Be quiet.
Be quiet.

08:09.053 --> 08:13.290
Tracie! Tracie!

08:14.659 --> 08:16.993
Please! Please!

08:18.696 --> 08:21.864
Tracie! Tracie!

08:34.212 --> 08:35.378
My phone.

08:40.585 --> 08:41.585
Tracie?

08:48.268 --> 08:49.268
Dad?

08:49.293 --> 08:50.393
Shhh, hold on.

09:01.739 --> 09:03.273
Baby, stay here.

09:08.346 --> 09:10.247
- Dad be careful!
- Get back inside!

09:11.982 --> 09:13.383
Rachel?

09:13.451 --> 09:14.851
Rachel where are you?

09:15.052 --> 09:16.586
Mr. Jackson?

09:16.654 --> 09:17.987
Rachel!

09:39.577 --> 09:40.577
Rachel!

09:41.512 --> 09:42.512
Mr. Jackson!

09:43.013 --> 09:45.214
Mr. Jackson! Ahh!

09:56.360 --> 09:58.060
Ahh!

10:32.663 --> 10:33.663
Shhh.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.401
Baby I tried to save her.

10:39.269 --> 10:40.403
I tried to save Rachel.

10:43.173 --> 10:46.309
I tried to save her, I tried.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.251
Don't you worry. I'm not
going to let them get you.

10:49.647 --> 10:51.348
I'm not going to
let them get you.

10:51.749 --> 10:52.749
I got you.

10:53.484 --> 10:54.484
I got you.

11:04.562 --> 11:05.562
Patrick?

11:05.596 --> 11:07.397
Birdie, it's Joe.

11:07.465 --> 11:09.265
Tell Patrick to bring water!

11:09.333 --> 11:11.801
It's not him mom, it's
Joseph from next door.

11:11.869 --> 11:13.603
Listen, did Patrick and
Tracie get back yet?

11:13.671 --> 11:16.038
No, not yet.

11:16.707 --> 11:19.576
Ok umm, you and your mom should
just come over because we want

11:19.643 --> 11:21.511
to get into the safe room
sooner rather than later.

11:21.579 --> 11:22.746
- Tracie?
- No.

11:23.897 --> 11:25.458
Birdie, someone is
pounding on the door.

11:25.483 --> 11:26.616
Ok mom!

11:26.684 --> 11:28.117
Listen, somebody is at the door.

11:28.185 --> 11:29.051
What?

11:29.119 --> 11:29.952
I think that it
might be Patrick.

11:30.020 --> 11:31.521
Well don't just open the door.

11:31.589 --> 11:33.390
We will be right over, ok.

11:33.457 --> 11:35.224
Make sure before
you open the door.

11:40.398 --> 11:41.431
Help please!

11:42.199 --> 11:44.834
Oh my God please!
Just open the door!

11:44.902 --> 11:45.735
Please let me in!

11:45.803 --> 11:47.203
I don't recognize that voice!

11:47.271 --> 11:48.271
Please!

11:48.338 --> 11:49.171
Don't let them in.

11:49.239 --> 11:50.640
Please help me!

11:50.708 --> 11:51.741
Please!

11:51.809 --> 11:52.809
Don't let them in!

11:52.843 --> 11:54.744
Please help!

11:55.579 --> 11:57.580
They'll kill us Birdie.

11:57.648 --> 12:00.249
Somebody help! Ahh!

12:24.909 --> 12:27.510
Help! Please!

12:27.578 --> 12:30.780
Please let me in!

12:36.754 --> 12:38.054
Mom?

12:45.796 --> 12:47.263
Mom just stay there.

12:58.943 --> 13:01.611
Mom, stay away from the windows.
Stay away from the door.

13:01.679 --> 13:03.780
I'll be back mom.
I'll be right back.

13:03.848 --> 13:05.314
Don't move, ok?

14:11.849 --> 14:12.916
Don't move!

14:18.832 --> 14:19.832
Police.

14:19.857 --> 14:21.357
Someone's being attacked.

14:21.425 --> 14:22.491
I think she's dead.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.993
They tried to break in!

14:24.061 --> 14:25.394
This is Barbara Lincoln.

14:26.764 --> 14:27.764
Mrs. Lincoln?

14:29.667 --> 14:30.867
From Silverwood High?

14:31.769 --> 14:32.802
Yes.

14:32.870 --> 14:34.737
This is Vincent
Lopez, class of 2000.

14:34.805 --> 14:37.640
I got suspended for tagging.

14:38.008 --> 14:39.809
You're an officer now?

14:39.877 --> 14:41.911
Yeah, yeah thanks to you.

14:41.979 --> 14:44.781
You were the only one
that ever believed in me.

14:45.574 --> 14:46.574
Birdie!

14:46.599 --> 14:48.718
Wait, Mrs. Lincoln do you
still live on Pine street?

14:48.786 --> 14:49.819
There's someone in the house!

14:49.887 --> 14:51.821
I think they're
going to kill us!

14:51.889 --> 14:57.927
Birdie! I'm scared, Birdie!
I'm scared Birdie, I'm scared!

14:57.995 --> 14:59.428
I'm coming to help
you right now.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
I'll be right there.

15:05.736 --> 15:06.736
Johnson!

15:12.351 --> 15:13.351
Johnson!

15:13.376 --> 15:14.543
Johnson!

15:19.416 --> 15:20.583
Officer Johnson, stop!

15:20.651 --> 15:21.651
Stop!

15:39.103 --> 15:40.103
Mom?

15:41.639 --> 15:42.639
Mom?

15:46.644 --> 15:47.644
Mom.

15:49.412 --> 15:50.546
Mom are you ok?

15:51.548 --> 15:52.548
Mom?

15:56.153 --> 15:57.553
I heard them.

15:58.989 --> 16:01.390
I heard them upstairs.

16:01.659 --> 16:03.592
Oh mom, that was me.

16:03.661 --> 16:05.327
That was just me.
I was getting...

16:17.507 --> 16:18.507
Anybody there?

16:21.411 --> 16:22.411
Hello?

16:24.614 --> 16:25.614
Anybody there?

16:30.854 --> 16:31.854
Hello?

16:35.458 --> 16:36.559
I have a gun!

16:40.430 --> 16:43.032
It's ok mom. I think
it's nothing.

16:43.543 --> 16:44.543
It's nothing.

16:49.973 --> 16:50.973
Stay here mom.

16:51.809 --> 16:52.809
Come out!

16:58.648 --> 16:59.648
Come out.

17:05.756 --> 17:08.424
I have a gun and
I will shoot it.

17:15.531 --> 17:16.531
Shoot it!

17:19.402 --> 17:23.039
Don't shoot me, don't shoot!

17:24.108 --> 17:25.108
Don't shoot.

17:25.909 --> 17:28.077
Janice? Is that...

17:29.512 --> 17:30.679
Please don't shoot.

17:32.182 --> 17:34.450
Don't, don't move.

17:34.517 --> 17:35.618
Stay where you are.

17:35.685 --> 17:37.787
I'm not one of them, I promise.

17:37.855 --> 17:39.588
Why are you bleeding?

17:40.624 --> 17:43.425
Please, I didn't
mean to scare you.

17:43.493 --> 17:44.660
I didn't know where else to go.

17:44.728 --> 17:47.496
My boyfriend, Michael,
he just attacked me!

17:47.865 --> 17:48.965
He tried to bite me.

17:53.703 --> 17:54.784
Oh my God look at this.

17:56.731 --> 17:58.851
They are tearing each
other apart out there.

18:04.014 --> 18:05.815
It's just not safe to go.

18:06.216 --> 18:08.818
Irena, don't go.

18:09.853 --> 18:12.688
I have to go be
with my family now.

18:13.123 --> 18:15.858
God bless and protect
you sweet boy.

18:18.979 --> 18:21.140
Please, we will take you
home when it is safe.

18:21.165 --> 18:23.465
I can't wait. Do you
understand this?

18:24.034 --> 18:25.601
My mother needs these.

18:25.669 --> 18:26.669
She needs me.

18:26.736 --> 18:28.616
Karen, will you shut
her the hell up.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.677
But your dead will live.

18:36.546 --> 18:38.114
Their bodies will rise.

18:39.749 --> 18:42.084
The earth will give
birth to her dead.

18:43.020 --> 18:47.123
Go my people. Enter your rooms
and shut the doors behind you.

18:47.191 --> 18:48.858
That's enough.

18:48.926 --> 18:53.996
Hide yourselves for a little while.
Until his wrath has passed by.

18:54.046 --> 18:55.348
- I'll slap your face!
- Dad what are you doing?

18:55.398 --> 18:56.598
I've had it!

18:57.901 --> 18:59.101
No one is leaving this house!

18:59.136 --> 19:01.070
This door doesn't open
for you or anyone else!

19:01.138 --> 19:02.271
What about Tracie
and her family?

19:02.339 --> 19:04.006
They had their shot.
That's it, they missed it.

19:04.074 --> 19:05.674
No, you promised me.

19:06.276 --> 19:08.044
I'm not your servant.

19:08.555 --> 19:09.555
You have no right.

19:09.580 --> 19:13.140
Oh I have every right. This is my house,
this is my family. That gives me the right.

19:14.251 --> 19:16.291
What is wrong with you?
Take this, take this.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.030
Stop it.

19:18.055 --> 19:18.955
Joseph!

19:19.022 --> 19:20.756
Stop!

19:20.824 --> 19:21.945
Stop it, you go in here.

19:24.594 --> 19:26.628
I'm sorry Irena.
This is for your own good.

19:29.075 --> 19:30.075
What are you doing?

19:30.100 --> 19:31.667
Locking her in this room.

20:02.966 --> 20:04.066
She's safe.

20:05.903 --> 20:07.836
She's safe. She'll be fine.

20:24.388 --> 20:25.621
Now come on, let's get going.

20:27.157 --> 20:29.077
We got to get everything
up to the safe room.

20:29.226 --> 20:31.994
We got to lock that door in
about ten minutes. Come on!

20:32.062 --> 20:33.062
Let's go, come on.

21:12.069 --> 21:13.635
Joseph she's screaming.

21:13.703 --> 21:15.704
She'll run out of
steam pretty soon.

21:20.277 --> 21:22.744
She's ok. Come on. Come on.

21:27.817 --> 21:29.818
It's ok. She'll be fine.

21:49.906 --> 21:58.147
Ahh!

22:27.077 --> 22:29.378
Oh God. It's the same recording.

22:30.823 --> 22:31.823
Text her honey.

22:31.848 --> 22:34.150
I did. She hasn't responded.

22:34.351 --> 22:36.318
I told them to get to
the madden safe house.

22:37.388 --> 22:38.886
I don't want her to
leave the house.

22:38.912 --> 22:40.813
It's not safe for her to
go outside right now.

22:41.891 --> 22:44.026
Do you think help will come?

22:44.094 --> 22:45.961
For us?

22:46.029 --> 22:47.996
For anyone?

22:51.834 --> 22:53.102
I don't know honey.

22:58.075 --> 22:59.408
Crap there's another one.

23:04.347 --> 23:05.347

23:05.949 --> 23:06.949
Just take this.

23:08.017 --> 23:10.086
Dad I don't know what
to do with this.

23:10.153 --> 23:13.055
Do whatever it takes honey.

23:13.123 --> 23:14.363
We are gonna get through this.

23:15.358 --> 23:16.492
Ok.

23:38.181 --> 23:40.983
Dad! Dad!

23:41.050 --> 23:42.884
Dad! Get him off me.

23:43.453 --> 23:45.988
Dad! Please help!

23:50.093 --> 23:51.934
I gotta get something
to cut that wire.

24:01.938 --> 24:03.739
Ouch! Ow.

24:05.275 --> 24:06.275
Ok.

24:12.986 --> 24:15.227
- Maybe you should put this on your face.
- Oh thank you.

24:15.252 --> 24:16.385
I didn't know where else to go.

24:16.453 --> 24:18.820
It's ok. You did the right
thing by coming here.

24:18.888 --> 24:21.423
I called the police.
They should be here by now.

24:21.491 --> 24:22.991
The Police? What...

24:23.059 --> 24:25.060
Oh! What happened?

24:27.364 --> 24:28.797
The power is out mom.

24:34.971 --> 24:36.805
Oh thank God.

24:38.308 --> 24:42.010
Oh listen, we are going to have
to take everything that we can

24:42.078 --> 24:44.613

put it up against the doors.

24:44.681 --> 24:45.548
This one and the front one.

24:45.615 --> 24:46.716
Ok.

24:46.766 --> 24:50.085

gonna put up against all the windows.

24:50.153 --> 24:52.154

24:52.222 --> 24:53.642
I mean anything that's
not nailed down.

24:53.668 --> 24:55.583
Anything strong let's put
them against these windows.

24:55.625 --> 24:56.425
Ok.

24:56.493 --> 24:58.227
Call the police again.
They should be here by now.

24:58.295 --> 25:00.162

25:06.836 --> 25:08.637
Listen mom I'm sorry.

25:08.705 --> 25:11.607
Listen, the phone is dead ok?

25:11.675 --> 25:15.244
The phone is dead and we can't
call and wait for somebody

25:15.312 --> 25:19.648
to come and help us. We have
to do it ourselves. Mom.

25:19.716 --> 25:22.418
- What was that?
- It was just mom.

25:22.485 --> 25:26.188

32:26.609 --> 32:28.476
You could turn into one of them.

32:32.715 --> 32:34.683
I don't think I am.

32:34.751 --> 32:36.284
How do you know!

33:03.780 --> 33:06.514
You've got your sleeping bag
and all of your goodies.

33:06.716 --> 33:07.797
It's just like camping.

33:10.920 --> 33:11.920
Come here.

33:12.789 --> 33:14.422
Everything is going

33:15.091 --> 33:16.658
This room is safe.

33:28.071 --> 33:29.071
See.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.075
Nothing is going to get you.

33:34.143 --> 33:37.145
And in a couple days,
may be a week...

33:37.213 --> 33:40.615
The police are gonna come and they're
gonna make all the bad guys go away.

33:42.484 --> 33:44.019
'Cause the good guys always win.

33:44.664 --> 33:46.664
And we are gonna have
our friends here.

33:46.689 --> 33:47.789
You like Tracie.

33:48.557 --> 33:49.858

33:51.994 --> 33:53.461
You feel cold.

33:54.230 --> 33:55.463

more thing then we're gonna be all set.

34:11.047 --> 34:12.614
So I need you to stay here.

34:12.681 --> 34:13.715
You hear me?

34:13.783 --> 34:14.783
Stay right here.

34:18.920 --> 34:20.554
Ok mommy is gonna shut the door.

34:20.822 --> 34:21.989
So you'll be safe.

34:25.995 --> 34:27.594
Perry come on we gotta go now.

34:28.931 --> 34:29.931

34:32.534 --> 34:35.603
You can't stay down here. Ok you
can't stay down here it's not safe.

34:35.670 --> 34:38.139
We gotta go upstairs.
Look this is selfish.

34:38.206 --> 34:39.656
Every minute that you
are spending down here

34:39.681 --> 34:41.001
you are endangering
your little brother.

34:41.043 --> 34:42.210
You don't understand.

34:42.261 --> 34:44.913
No I do understand. You are trying to
control something you can't control.

34:44.981 --> 34:46.822
And you texting her
over and over and over

34:46.849 --> 34:48.775
it's not gonna make her
respond any quicker.

34:48.818 --> 34:50.518
I'm trying to control
something I can't control?

34:50.585 --> 34:51.619
Yes. Yes.

34:51.687 --> 34:52.847
What's happening with you?

34:52.889 --> 34:54.054
- I'm trying to keep everyone safe.
- Hey guys?

34:54.123 --> 34:55.791
We have to stay safe.

34:55.858 --> 34:57.159
Alright?

34:57.226 --> 35:00.195
Now right now this is about
us keeping our family safe.

35:00.263 --> 35:01.663
She is my family!

35:01.730 --> 35:03.098
What's going on?

35:03.166 --> 35:04.900
He won't go upstairs.

35:04.967 --> 35:06.601
I told Tracie I'd wait for her.

35:08.905 --> 35:12.107
You've got to get your ass upstairs
or I'm a drag you up I swear.

35:12.175 --> 35:14.242
Look what are you shaking
your head about?

35:14.310 --> 35:16.711
Look at what's going on outside?

35:16.779 --> 35:19.214
We're not safe in this room.
We got to get upstairs.

35:19.282 --> 35:20.548
That's it. That's it.

35:20.616 --> 35:23.952
She will get back to you if
she can get back to you.

35:24.020 --> 35:26.554
You two are making me crazy.

35:28.791 --> 35:30.511
Irena?

35:31.894 --> 35:36.031
Now listen.
Those things are outside.

35:37.900 --> 35:42.137
We have a safe place upstairs and
we are all going up. Everyone!

35:48.945 --> 35:50.611
Are you ok?

35:53.983 --> 35:57.552
When Tracie and her family get here
they can call and we'll them in.

35:57.619 --> 35:58.920
Don't cry.

36:05.794 --> 36:06.915
We'll let them in right?

36:06.963 --> 36:09.564
Yes. Yes. We'll let them in.

36:09.631 --> 36:12.500
Please let's go before
something bad happens.

36:48.104 --> 36:49.105
Nathan?

36:49.125 --> 36:50.805
You know all that stuff
I said before about

36:50.830 --> 36:52.498
them missing their chance,
I didn't mean it.

36:52.541 --> 36:54.742
I just got scared.
Alright we'll let them in.

36:54.810 --> 36:57.290
They will get here. Patrick will
find us and we'll let them in.

36:57.313 --> 36:58.947
But right now we
got to stay safe.

36:59.015 --> 37:00.681
Or we can't help
anybody, alright?

37:00.749 --> 37:02.350
So we have to go
upstairs right now.

37:02.418 --> 37:04.119
You and...

37:04.186 --> 37:06.554
Nathan!

37:07.056 --> 37:09.224
Nathan! Joe! Perry!
Where is Nathan?

37:09.292 --> 37:10.858
What? What?

37:10.927 --> 37:12.093
Where is Nathan?

37:12.161 --> 37:13.128
I thought he was with you?

37:13.195 --> 37:14.629
No! He's not there!

37:14.696 --> 37:16.697
I don't know where he is!

37:19.235 --> 37:20.335
Nathan!

37:23.339 --> 37:24.605
Where's the gun?

37:32.714 --> 37:33.982
Oh my God!

37:42.992 --> 37:44.292
Nathan!

37:44.360 --> 37:46.727
Get out of here!
Get him out of here!

38:11.954 --> 38:13.288
Shoot 'em in the head!

38:13.990 --> 38:14.990
Shoot it!

38:32.774 --> 38:35.810
Aah!

38:51.494 --> 38:53.828
I - I don't think
she'll get up again.

38:58.901 --> 39:02.370
And, I don't think you'll
change into one of them.

39:05.374 --> 39:06.974
Birdie I'm sorry.

39:12.415 --> 39:14.882
Oh God. What's gonna
happen to us?

39:17.420 --> 39:18.753
I don't know.

39:20.523 --> 39:24.192
You think you mom was r-right
and there's a cop coming?

39:24.993 --> 39:27.362
My mom hasn't been
all there for years.

39:27.863 --> 39:32.167
I don't even know if she
talk to the police.

39:36.972 --> 39:39.740
It's more of them.
They're coming for us.

39:39.808 --> 39:40.908
Maybe the cops.

39:44.046 --> 39:45.167
There's too many of them.

39:57.326 --> 39:58.326
Oh my God.

40:00.463 --> 40:01.463
Birdie!

40:10.172 --> 40:12.039
- Mom it's us!
- Birdie it's us! Let us in!

40:32.128 --> 40:33.228
Are you guys ok?

40:40.136 --> 40:41.136
You hurt?

40:41.203 --> 40:42.970
No. Everything is ok.
I'm ok, I'm ok.

40:43.272 --> 40:44.506
Is anyone else hurt?

40:44.573 --> 40:45.740
My mom.

40:46.908 --> 40:49.477
She bit Birdie but
we think she's ok.

40:50.246 --> 40:51.846
They got Nana?

40:51.913 --> 40:53.114
I got Nana.

40:53.582 --> 40:55.383
She kept coming after us.

40:59.921 --> 41:00.921
It's ok.

41:23.179 --> 41:24.312
You did the right thing.

41:27.082 --> 41:28.949
I mean she would have
killed you both.

41:33.922 --> 41:35.122
Did they attack her?

41:35.691 --> 41:37.058
We don't know.

41:37.108 --> 41:40.094
She just died of a heart attack
or something. And then she turned

41:40.162 --> 41:44.199
and she kept coming at us so,
we shot her a bunch of times.

41:44.266 --> 41:46.401
And finally Birdie
got her in the head.

41:47.269 --> 41:48.903
Then she stopped baby?

41:48.970 --> 41:49.970
Yeah.

41:56.478 --> 41:57.512
Oh God.

42:07.256 --> 42:10.458
It's ok. It's the only
way to stop them.

42:10.659 --> 42:13.394
I was so worried about Nana.

42:19.468 --> 42:20.468
Tracie.

42:24.506 --> 42:26.507
Oh. Oh God.

42:36.518 --> 42:37.518
Aah!

42:37.586 --> 42:38.586
Ok. Ok here.

42:38.621 --> 42:40.421
Aah.

42:40.489 --> 42:41.989
Ok, ok.

42:42.057 --> 42:43.358
Ok.

42:45.160 --> 42:46.327
Mom's got you.

42:46.395 --> 42:47.395
I got you.

43:02.314 --> 43:03.554
Right in there. Right in there.

43:05.381 --> 43:08.781
Direct pressure, direct pressure.
Right there. Direct pressure right there,

43:19.094 --> 43:21.396
Ok good. You got that out.

43:26.802 --> 43:28.169
Oh my God.

43:28.236 --> 43:29.637
Ok. Ok.

43:34.242 --> 43:35.910
Baby don't look. Don't look.

43:43.819 --> 43:46.260
There's suppose to be a
police office coming

43:46.286 --> 43:48.781
but they were suppose
to be here a while ago.

43:48.824 --> 43:50.358
We gotta go.

43:52.227 --> 43:54.508
The Madden's have a safe
house that we can stay at.

43:55.731 --> 43:57.632
Yeah dad.
Perry promised to let us in.

43:57.700 --> 44:01.220
They have enough food for weeks and he said
it would be best if we all stick together.

44:02.504 --> 44:03.638
Joe said so too.

44:04.072 --> 44:06.240
- I would if he said so.
- Perry promised.

44:07.609 --> 44:08.809
This door is not gonna hold.

44:09.545 --> 44:10.945
Let me check this window.

44:17.152 --> 44:18.353
It's rusted shut.

44:49.408 --> 44:50.928
Give me something to
break this window.

44:50.953 --> 44:53.053
Dad look out!

45:00.729 --> 45:01.729
They're coming!

45:02.564 --> 45:03.764
Come on. Let's go! Come on!

45:06.668 --> 45:08.369
We gotta go. We gotta go!

45:10.439 --> 45:11.439
Come on.

45:11.724 --> 45:13.684
Run next door to the Madden
house as fast you can.

45:13.709 --> 45:15.149
I'm not going
anywhere without you.

45:16.812 --> 45:18.045
Come on.

45:19.981 --> 45:23.384
Do me a favor Patrick, if something happens
to me... If I turn into one of them,

45:23.452 --> 45:25.386
you put me out of my misery.

45:40.836 --> 45:43.237
- Dad!
- Come on. Come on.

46:26.214 --> 46:29.584
Perry. Perry it's us let us in.

46:36.492 --> 46:37.658
Perry.

46:37.726 --> 46:38.860
Tracie's here.

46:40.496 --> 46:41.496
Perry let us in.

46:44.399 --> 46:46.767
Oh my God we're too late.
They must all be dead.

46:46.969 --> 46:47.969
Perry!

46:48.003 --> 46:49.370
Perry are you there?

46:50.005 --> 46:51.506
Mr. Madden let us in.

46:53.575 --> 46:55.242
Oh God now we are too late.

47:00.949 --> 47:02.383
Perry let us in!

47:02.627 --> 47:03.827
Come they're coming. Come on.

47:03.852 --> 47:05.352
No wait.

47:05.821 --> 47:06.821
Let us in!

47:06.855 --> 47:08.188
Let us in!

47:16.765 --> 47:17.899
No.

47:20.903 --> 47:22.703
Come on let us in!

47:28.977 --> 47:30.144
Joe.

47:31.479 --> 47:32.479
Let them in.

47:33.849 --> 47:34.849
Ok.

47:36.552 --> 47:37.552
Joe.

47:38.654 --> 47:39.921
For God sake let them in.

47:43.892 --> 47:46.293
Patrick, Tracie, Birdie.

47:46.361 --> 47:48.696
Thank God! Mr. Madden let us in.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.935
I'm sorry I'm afraid
I can't do that.

47:57.005 --> 47:58.606
I have to think of my family.

47:58.874 --> 48:00.441
You son of a bitch.

48:01.009 --> 48:02.176
What?

48:03.946 --> 48:06.246
What are you doing?
They're our neighbors.

48:06.314 --> 48:08.849
I'm keeping us alive.
I'm keeping us alive.

48:10.586 --> 48:11.586
Perry.

48:12.988 --> 48:14.889
Come on Perry let us in.

48:18.093 --> 48:20.628
Baby please! Perry come on!

48:21.830 --> 48:22.964
Listen.

48:24.466 --> 48:28.703
There's reports coming in from
Europe that these things and the

48:28.770 --> 48:32.607
attacks just stop when
the sun comes up.

48:34.476 --> 48:37.511
So you only have to make it
through to the morning, you see?

48:37.813 --> 48:39.413
If we make it through this I'm
kill this son of a bitch.

48:39.481 --> 48:40.815
- Honey.
- What baby?

48:41.628 --> 48:45.028
But I can't take a chance and open the
door. Because we had one attack already.

48:45.053 --> 48:45.886
We gotta go. We gotta go.

48:45.954 --> 48:47.855
I just can't take the chance.

48:49.691 --> 48:51.425
- So good luck.
- They're our neighbors.

48:51.493 --> 48:53.133
- Save Perry.
- Come on, come on, come on.

48:53.194 --> 48:54.595
Good luck to you.

48:58.600 --> 48:59.767
Good luck.

49:02.838 --> 49:03.904
Tracie come on!

49:06.008 --> 49:07.374
Come on.

49:07.442 --> 49:10.077
Karen has a green house. I think
she said its storm proof.

49:10.145 --> 49:12.145
Keep coming this way girls.
Come on. Come on.

49:18.820 --> 49:21.421
They've been our
neighbors for 18 years.

49:27.829 --> 49:29.630
Our children grew up together.

49:33.535 --> 49:36.303
Perry.

49:40.508 --> 49:43.911
You carried Tracie in your own
arms when she twisted her ankle.

49:45.584 --> 49:47.624
How could you leave
them out there to die?

49:47.649 --> 49:49.283
Patrick would have
done the same thing.

49:52.888 --> 49:54.822
Hold on here.
Wait wait wait wait.

50:05.734 --> 50:08.294
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

50:09.805 --> 50:10.805
Come on.

50:11.907 --> 50:13.040
Honey give me that rake.

50:52.480 --> 50:53.614
You're ok.

50:53.681 --> 50:54.849
We need more towels.
We need more towels.

50:54.916 --> 50:56.050
There aren't any.

50:58.053 --> 50:59.720
It's ok. You're ok.

51:01.656 --> 51:02.890
If I could see the wound.

51:04.059 --> 51:05.392
Oh!

51:06.728 --> 51:08.595
Oh! If I could see it!

51:08.663 --> 51:09.943
If we can see it we can sew it.

51:09.965 --> 51:11.132
It's too deep.

51:11.199 --> 51:13.600
We can try to sew it.
Let's just try to sew it.

51:26.047 --> 51:27.128
He's not gonna make it.

51:28.884 --> 51:29.965
He's not gonna make it.

51:31.286 --> 51:33.206
He's not gonna make it.

51:34.156 --> 51:35.876
It's alright.

51:36.774 --> 51:38.534
I'm so sorry.

51:50.672 --> 51:51.972
Don't you dare.

51:52.974 --> 51:56.010
No! Don't you dare.

51:56.611 --> 52:00.447
You want the last thing he sees
is you blowing out his brains?

52:02.317 --> 52:03.483
He's gonna turn.

52:03.551 --> 52:04.218
No.

52:04.286 --> 52:05.853
You want to be in here
with him when he turns?

52:05.921 --> 52:07.888
I will not let you
murder our child.

52:07.956 --> 52:08.722
I'm not gonna murder him.

52:08.790 --> 52:11.125
You did. You killed them.

52:11.193 --> 52:12.726
I did not.

52:14.830 --> 52:18.465
I didn't, I didn't.
Ok here take it.

52:49.197 --> 52:50.231
Mrs. Lincoln?

52:58.974 --> 52:59.974
Hello?

53:11.219 --> 53:13.120
Hello? Is anybody in here?

53:29.137 --> 53:31.638
This is officer Lopez.
Please answer me Mrs. Lincoln.

53:35.944 --> 53:37.077
Mrs. Lincoln!

53:46.821 --> 53:47.888
Mrs. Lincoln?

54:04.072 --> 54:05.272
I'm so sorry.

54:31.466 --> 54:32.833
You think it'll hold?

54:38.873 --> 54:41.408
You think it's storm proof?

54:41.476 --> 54:43.077
That's what Karen said.

54:43.378 --> 54:44.378
You think so?

54:46.848 --> 54:48.115
Perry's dead.

54:48.416 --> 54:50.284
Hush honey. You don't know that.

54:50.352 --> 54:51.952
No. He must be.

54:52.020 --> 54:55.822
Other wise he would have let us in
or run downstairs to be with me.

54:55.890 --> 54:58.325
He - He wouldn't just
leave me like that.

54:58.793 --> 55:00.861
Baby maybe he's hurt.

55:03.131 --> 55:04.365
Maybe Joe has him tied up.

55:05.433 --> 55:06.900
Maybe he's a big rat.

55:08.870 --> 55:12.939
I hate to break it to you all but, Patrick
you are the only decent guy I know.

55:13.008 --> 55:14.168
The rest of them are rats.

55:16.194 --> 55:18.154
Your boyfriend is a rat
just like his daddy.

55:18.179 --> 55:21.181
You know what rats do when
the first sight of trouble?

55:21.249 --> 55:22.282
They run.

55:22.750 --> 55:24.118
God, I don't know what to think.

55:25.020 --> 55:27.020
You just think the best
of people baby, ok?

55:27.055 --> 55:29.156
Do let anybody ever take
that away from you.

55:29.391 --> 55:31.958
- Ok?
- Ok. I really love you mom.

55:32.027 --> 55:33.293
I love you too baby.

55:43.971 --> 55:46.073
Dad.

55:54.849 --> 55:56.683
Come on. Get behind the table.

55:58.953 --> 55:59.953
What are you doing?

56:01.366 --> 56:03.366
I don't know. I don't know.
Let me think.

56:09.130 --> 56:10.364
We should get the hell out.

56:11.832 --> 56:14.234
Well at least it's holding.
We are ok here for a while.

56:14.302 --> 56:16.870
What's the difference?
There is no point anymore.

56:17.072 --> 56:18.138
What's that?

56:19.941 --> 56:20.941
Watch out baby.

56:29.799 --> 56:31.069
Shit! Don't look.

56:36.124 --> 56:37.857
Maybe they'll go away.

56:37.925 --> 56:39.493
Oh my God. Oh my God.

56:39.561 --> 56:40.827
Maybe it will really hold.

56:49.304 --> 56:52.172
Wait. What is that one doing?

56:53.174 --> 56:54.174
Digging.

56:54.242 --> 56:55.409
He's just gonna hit
the foundation.

56:55.477 --> 56:58.011
There is no foundation.
It's a dirt floor.

56:58.079 --> 56:59.779
We should have gotten
out when I said.

56:59.981 --> 57:01.781
There's too many of them now.

57:04.486 --> 57:06.052
Dad do something!

57:11.392 --> 57:13.260
This is my family! Back off!

57:14.629 --> 57:17.297
Back off! Back off!

57:17.365 --> 57:18.465
Back off!

57:18.533 --> 57:19.566
My family!

57:24.905 --> 57:27.241
Back off!

57:33.914 --> 57:34.914
They listened.

57:35.159 --> 57:36.159
Dad you did it.

57:37.418 --> 57:38.718
What's that sound?

57:38.786 --> 57:41.087
This is the police. Everybody get down.
Get down!

57:41.156 --> 57:42.256
The police.

57:47.328 --> 57:49.062
Get down. Get down!

57:52.500 --> 57:54.268
No Dad. Dad we have to help him.

57:55.679 --> 57:56.679
Help him!

57:56.704 --> 57:57.904
Get down.

58:03.944 --> 58:04.944
Glass.

58:12.287 --> 58:15.422
Come on. Come on. Climb up.
Climb up to the mate and balcony.

58:15.490 --> 58:16.490
- What?
- You gotta get up there.

58:16.558 --> 58:17.791
Come on baby.

58:19.260 --> 58:21.161
No dad I can't climb like that.

58:21.229 --> 58:23.197
Tracie I'm get you safe but you got to help
me out here. I can't do it alone. Come on.

58:23.264 --> 58:24.385
Come on. Get up. Get up.

58:24.399 --> 58:25.199
Hurry.

58:25.266 --> 58:26.933
- Put your foot up here.
- Ok.

58:27.335 --> 58:28.335
Hurry!

58:29.504 --> 58:31.137
Trace wait for us when
you get up there.

58:31.606 --> 58:32.606
Ok.

58:39.103 --> 58:41.023
There won't be enough room.
We won't all make it.

58:41.048 --> 58:42.369
We'll do it honey,
it'll hold you.

58:42.417 --> 58:43.417
Come on.

58:57.632 --> 58:58.898
Got it?

58:59.100 --> 59:00.100
Yeah.

59:01.202 --> 59:03.282
Give me your foot baby.
Come on Birdie we got this.

59:53.688 --> 59:54.848
Birdie take Tracie inside.

59:58.693 --> 01:00:00.193
I have a promise I
intend to keep.

01:00:13.107 --> 01:00:14.107
Come on.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.280
Perry?

01:00:20.481 --> 01:00:26.119
No. No.

01:00:39.367 --> 01:00:41.000
I'm so sorry Perry.

01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:50.510
Ok.

01:00:53.848 --> 01:00:54.848
Ok.

01:00:56.217 --> 01:00:57.283
We have to do this.

01:00:59.654 --> 01:01:00.687
We have to do this.

01:01:19.374 --> 01:01:20.640
I'm so sorry Perry.

01:01:42.329 --> 01:01:43.563
Oh my God!

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.441
Oh my God. Oh my God!

01:01:55.509 --> 01:01:57.412
Karen get out!

01:01:59.814 --> 01:02:00.814
Perry!

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:16.530
Help us.

01:02:19.199 --> 01:02:20.199
Please help.

01:02:20.802 --> 01:02:22.335
No we can't take the risk.

01:02:22.403 --> 01:02:23.069
Come on.

01:02:23.137 --> 01:02:24.805
You wanted us dead.

01:02:28.409 --> 01:02:32.712
No, no, no. We were just
trying to stay alive.

01:02:32.914 --> 01:02:34.147
Who's in there?

01:02:34.214 --> 01:02:35.682
Nathan!

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:37.417
Nathan is still alive?

01:02:37.485 --> 01:02:39.252
- He's so scared.
- He's in there?

01:02:49.296 --> 01:02:50.296
Please.

01:02:56.303 --> 01:02:57.337
Tracie.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.041
Perry.

01:03:02.977 --> 01:03:04.210
Oh my God.

01:03:14.355 --> 01:03:15.355
No!

01:03:15.957 --> 01:03:17.190
You'll hit Nathan.

01:03:21.863 --> 01:03:24.703
Alright Nathan. Come out this way buddy.
Just crawl around your dad, ok?

01:03:24.732 --> 01:03:25.866
Come around here buddy.

01:03:25.933 --> 01:03:27.100
Nathan baby.

01:03:27.835 --> 01:03:28.835
Come on out.

01:03:31.973 --> 01:03:33.807
It's ok. Come to mommy.

01:03:48.856 --> 01:03:49.856
Sshh.

01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:51.625
Come quick.

01:04:11.879 --> 01:04:13.880
No! No!

01:04:13.948 --> 01:04:15.649
Let go! Let him go!

01:04:31.331 --> 01:04:32.452
Come on honey. Watch out.

01:05:01.462 --> 01:05:02.596
Hurry they're inside!

01:05:14.008 --> 01:05:15.609
Watch out honey. Come on.
Watch out.

01:05:15.676 --> 01:05:16.676
Come on Tracie.

01:05:28.623 --> 01:05:29.623
Hurry!

01:05:33.828 --> 01:05:34.828
The bank.

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:37.463
I know the code.

01:05:37.732 --> 01:05:38.898
There's a security system.

01:05:39.533 --> 01:05:41.467
We'll be safe inside the vault.

01:05:42.402 --> 01:05:44.871
Perry. I love you.

01:05:59.687 --> 01:06:01.721
Come. Come on. Come on.

01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:11.865
What about that car?

01:06:15.136 --> 01:06:17.337
Maybe we can try to get
it working or something.

01:06:27.948 --> 01:06:28.948
Dad.

01:06:39.026 --> 01:06:41.627
- Where's your car Karen?
- It's in the garage.

01:06:43.964 --> 01:06:45.865
But the keys are in
Joseph's pocket.

01:06:48.669 --> 01:06:50.837
Dad. Dad look. The police.

01:06:50.905 --> 01:06:53.506
- Are those police lights?
- Come on.

01:06:56.043 --> 01:06:57.043
Hello?

01:06:57.912 --> 01:06:58.912
Help us!

01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:04.050
Help us!

01:07:04.719 --> 01:07:06.586
Officer! Help!

01:07:11.859 --> 01:07:15.095
Those weren't police lights.
Those were construction lights.

01:07:15.162 --> 01:07:16.730
Dad we're trapped.

01:07:20.067 --> 01:07:21.067
We gotta go down.

01:07:21.736 --> 01:07:22.736
We gotta go down.

01:07:28.675 --> 01:07:30.376
Here Karen. Hold this.

01:07:34.715 --> 01:07:35.915
We're going down. Get ready.

01:07:46.961 --> 01:07:48.394
Go Go!

01:07:53.167 --> 01:07:54.167
Nathan you go next.

01:07:56.771 --> 01:07:57.771
Go.

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:04.110
Quickly but safely.

01:08:08.582 --> 01:08:09.703
Go ahead honey. Go ahead.

01:08:28.202 --> 01:08:29.202
Give me that rock!

01:08:43.184 --> 01:08:44.483
Come on guys let's go.

01:09:04.604 --> 01:09:05.904
I'm so sorry about Perry.

01:09:05.973 --> 01:09:07.173
And about your husband.

01:09:08.442 --> 01:09:11.676
I am so sorry I ever
doubted you and Perry.

01:09:12.046 --> 01:09:14.848
Honey he loved you so much.

01:09:14.915 --> 01:09:18.184
He wanted you there. He just.

01:09:18.785 --> 01:09:20.053
He couldn't move.

01:09:21.087 --> 01:09:22.555
Oh my God.

01:09:22.923 --> 01:09:24.122
I knew it.

01:09:38.973 --> 01:09:40.538
I'm trying to move this plate.

01:09:44.278 --> 01:09:45.278
It's stuck.

01:09:49.383 --> 01:09:52.218
Maybe we should stay down here for a while.
I mean if we only

01:09:52.286 --> 01:09:55.021
have to make it till sunrise
this could be our best bet.

01:09:58.825 --> 01:10:02.345
You know it's not a bad idea. Maybe we have
to figure out what's behind those vines.

01:10:10.037 --> 01:10:11.804
I can't imagine it
could be any worse.

01:10:12.273 --> 01:10:13.753
Dad.

01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:15.851
I think you better
come see this.

01:10:15.876 --> 01:10:17.610
What is it baby?

01:10:28.155 --> 01:10:29.276
They're digging through.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:31.767
Come on honey follow me.
Come on.

01:10:31.792 --> 01:10:32.832
We gotta run come on.

01:10:33.928 --> 01:10:35.028
Help me out with this.

01:10:37.831 --> 01:10:41.034
Ok. No everybody help.

01:10:41.101 --> 01:10:43.937
Just put your weight into it.
We can hold them off ok?

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.606
Dad what are we gonna do?

01:10:47.674 --> 01:10:48.874
We gotta hold them off honey.

01:10:48.943 --> 01:10:50.024
We gotta hold them off.

01:10:54.381 --> 01:10:55.714
I think one just fell through.

01:10:59.286 --> 01:11:00.386
This is crazy!

01:11:05.725 --> 01:11:07.660
Alright we can hold
them off until sunrise.

01:11:07.727 --> 01:11:09.262
We should make a run for it.

01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:11.097
We don't know what's out there.

01:11:11.165 --> 01:11:13.333
Yes but we know what
is behind there.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.400
What are you waiting for?
Hold the door.

01:11:17.768 --> 01:11:19.248
Everyone just put
your weight into it.

01:11:19.273 --> 01:11:21.107
Can't take that risk
with my son's life.

01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:23.576
Come on honey let's go quick.

01:11:24.878 --> 01:11:26.112
But mommy.

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:27.213
Help us!

01:11:27.281 --> 01:11:29.282
He's all I got left. I'm sorry.

01:11:31.085 --> 01:11:32.585
We have to go.

01:11:36.457 --> 01:11:40.026
We have to get through these plants.
Help mommy get through these plants ok?

01:11:40.094 --> 01:11:41.961
We have to go back
and help them.

01:11:43.163 --> 01:11:45.264
I know you want to help. I know.

01:11:45.332 --> 01:11:47.700
But we have to get
through there, ok?

01:11:47.767 --> 01:11:50.370
We have to get through the other side.
Help me.

01:11:57.944 --> 01:11:59.078
There you go.

01:12:01.915 --> 01:12:03.016
Good. Go!

01:12:07.021 --> 01:12:09.088
Baby we're not gonna
be able to hold this.

01:12:10.748 --> 01:12:13.869
Listen to me. I want you to take Tracie
and I want you to make a run for it ok?

01:12:13.894 --> 01:12:16.262
You guys get a head start.
Just go.

01:12:18.399 --> 01:12:20.033
I love you. Just go.

01:12:21.368 --> 01:12:23.969
Move on three.

01:12:24.171 --> 01:12:25.538
One...

01:12:27.171 --> 01:12:28.538
Two...

01:12:29.171 --> 01:12:30.538
Three!

01:12:32.513 --> 01:12:34.047
Tracie, Tracie we
don't have a choice.

01:12:34.114 --> 01:12:36.015
No we can't leave dad.

01:12:59.573 --> 01:13:00.739
Dammit!

01:13:02.876 --> 01:13:04.143
Not the cemetery.

01:13:04.578 --> 01:13:05.811
Again.

01:13:09.083 --> 01:13:11.717
There's gotta be a safe place.

01:13:18.892 --> 01:13:20.726
Come on. Stay quiet.

01:13:30.003 --> 01:13:31.104
Help!

01:13:31.171 --> 01:13:32.171
Help us!

01:13:34.141 --> 01:13:35.841
Oh my God! It's Rachel.

01:13:37.244 --> 01:13:39.011
Hey! Hey Rachel!

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:41.880
Take him!

01:13:42.349 --> 01:13:44.016
Take him! Take him!

01:13:45.385 --> 01:13:47.253
Hey girl! Hey look at me.

01:13:52.493 --> 01:13:53.493
Watch over him.

01:13:53.494 --> 01:13:55.161
Rachel! Come on.

01:13:55.229 --> 01:13:56.295
Go!

01:13:57.631 --> 01:13:58.764
Rachel!

01:14:24.158 --> 01:14:25.158
Go.

01:14:36.537 --> 01:14:37.936
I'm going to check it out.

01:14:38.004 --> 01:14:39.338
Scream if you hear anything.

01:15:00.494 --> 01:15:03.062
Sometimes I have a nightmare.

01:15:03.129 --> 01:15:04.897
I had it lots of times.

01:15:05.566 --> 01:15:08.401
And everyone I
know is a monster.

01:15:08.468 --> 01:15:10.403
And they touch me.

01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:13.105
And I turn into one too.

01:15:13.173 --> 01:15:15.641
It's gonna be sunrise soon ok?

01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:18.344
We just have to hide until then.
We're gonna make it.

01:15:18.545 --> 01:15:21.514
Ok come on. It's safer in
here then it is out there.

01:15:27.087 --> 01:15:28.087
Come on.

01:15:28.155 --> 01:15:29.922
Alright let's
barricade the door.

01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:45.650
Let me see if I can
find something to use.

01:15:51.511 --> 01:15:53.879
Good Job. Good Job.

01:15:54.114 --> 01:15:55.114
Mom.

01:15:56.383 --> 01:15:57.383
Yeah?

01:15:58.252 --> 01:15:59.619
Mom. Look!

01:16:02.522 --> 01:16:03.922
Here you should take this.

01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.990
That's great.

01:16:06.526 --> 01:16:08.227
Get back. Get back.

01:16:37.724 --> 01:16:39.224
We gotta get Nathan safe.

01:16:39.293 --> 01:16:40.192
Ok come on.

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.360
Sshh. Right here.

01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:47.266
You. Stay. Stay back ok?

01:16:47.334 --> 01:16:49.201
We need you to stay there.

01:16:50.103 --> 01:16:51.103
Ok.

01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:06.118
Stop.

01:17:10.156 --> 01:17:11.156
Baby.

01:17:25.572 --> 01:17:27.473
Oh no baby you don't want that.

01:17:27.541 --> 01:17:29.508
No it's fine just
let him keep it.

01:17:35.114 --> 01:17:36.148
Sshh.

01:17:42.789 --> 01:17:45.658
Oh my God. They're here.

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.261
God it's gotta be sunrise soon.

01:17:49.639 --> 01:17:50.839
I'm putting you in a casket.

01:17:50.864 --> 01:17:51.697
What?

01:17:51.765 --> 01:17:52.898
Yes.

01:17:52.966 --> 01:17:55.133
You'll be safe.
They can't get a hold of you.

01:17:55.201 --> 01:17:57.102
You'll be safe. Get in here.

01:17:59.239 --> 01:18:00.473
Mom no!

01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:02.821
It's only a matter of time
before they get in here.

01:18:02.876 --> 01:18:05.043
Ok so you'll be safe in here.

01:18:05.111 --> 01:18:06.111
Now help me pick this up.

01:18:06.145 --> 01:18:07.813
But what about you?

01:18:07.881 --> 01:18:10.249
I'm gonna stay out and protect you
from anything that comes in here.

01:18:10.316 --> 01:18:12.351
No I'll help. We have a
better chance as a team.

01:18:12.419 --> 01:18:16.288
Baby you're right ok?
You're right but your father promised

01:18:16.356 --> 01:18:18.624
to keep you safe and now
it's my promise too.

01:18:21.327 --> 01:18:25.631
Nobody should ever ever have to go
through what you went through today.

01:18:25.699 --> 01:18:27.700
But I've got it ok?

01:18:27.768 --> 01:18:29.167
I've got it. Now lift!

01:18:29.235 --> 01:18:30.770
Nathan.

01:18:30.837 --> 01:18:31.470
Lift.

01:18:31.538 --> 01:18:33.406
Ready? 1... 2... 3.

01:18:35.174 --> 01:18:37.009
Ok good. Perfect.

01:18:41.247 --> 01:18:43.315
You look after Nathan ok?

01:18:43.383 --> 01:18:44.817
I want my mommy.

01:18:44.885 --> 01:18:48.487
I know sweetheart.
I want my mommy too.

01:18:48.555 --> 01:18:51.290
You are the bravest
boy that I know.

01:18:51.357 --> 01:18:54.226
You look after my
little girl ok?

01:18:54.594 --> 01:18:55.594
Ok.

01:18:58.432 --> 01:18:59.598
I love you mom.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:01.467
I'll see you at sunrise.

01:19:02.168 --> 01:19:03.502
I love you too baby.

01:19:05.171 --> 01:19:06.271
Sunrise.

01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:17.249
I want my mommy.

01:19:17.617 --> 01:19:19.485
I want everyone to be ok.

01:19:19.553 --> 01:19:24.189
I know. I know, but we
need to be very quiet.

01:19:24.257 --> 01:19:25.424
Ok?

01:19:36.503 --> 01:19:38.070
We can't let them hear us.

01:19:44.878 --> 01:19:47.312
Aah!

01:19:53.587 --> 01:19:55.253
God. Screw this.

01:19:55.455 --> 01:19:58.724
No. Please. Please stop.

01:20:00.994 --> 01:20:02.862
No. No.

01:20:02.929 --> 01:20:03.762
Please don't.

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:06.499
Please don't let them get me.

01:20:11.304 --> 01:20:12.471
Baby! Baby!

01:20:14.307 --> 01:20:15.307
Baby it's me!

01:20:15.942 --> 01:20:16.942
It's me.

01:20:18.012 --> 01:20:20.145
I just went for where
all the action was and

01:20:20.213 --> 01:20:22.333
I figured that's where
my Birdie is gonna be.

01:20:22.424 --> 01:20:23.424
Where's Tracie?

01:20:23.449 --> 01:20:24.950
She's safe. Patrick!

01:20:47.707 --> 01:20:49.474
Oh no! This doesn't look good.

01:20:49.543 --> 01:20:52.863
Come on baby we make a great team.
I'll set them up you'll knock them down.

01:20:53.446 --> 01:20:54.446
Karen!

01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:08.326
I love you Patrick.

01:21:09.429 --> 01:21:10.596
I love you too Birdie.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.600
Aah!

01:21:18.438 --> 01:21:21.607
Sshh. Very quiet.

01:21:21.675 --> 01:21:23.609
As quiet like a mouse.

01:21:23.677 --> 01:21:24.677
Ok?

01:21:28.514 --> 01:21:30.075
Mom.

01:21:31.651 --> 01:21:32.651
Sshh. Sshh.

01:21:32.886 --> 01:21:35.320
Quiet. Not a sound.

01:21:35.855 --> 01:21:36.855
Ok?

01:21:40.694 --> 01:21:42.255
Mom?

01:21:51.771 --> 01:21:52.972
Ssshh.

01:21:53.039 --> 01:21:54.206
How do you turn it off?

01:21:54.908 --> 01:21:55.989
How do we turn it off?

01:21:56.342 --> 01:21:57.910

01:22:18.765 --> 01:22:19.765
Tracie.

01:22:20.576 --> 01:22:21.576
Are you ok?

01:22:21.601 --> 01:22:22.935
Quite a hook there baby.

01:22:23.637 --> 01:22:24.803

You like pancakes?

01:22:37.518 --> 01:22:39.958
My Birdie here makes the best
pancakes in the whole world.

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.954

Ok buddy.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.240
Just keep walking straight out of here

01:22:58.705 --> 01:22:59.745
It's ok. Keep going.

01:23:02.175 --> 01:23:03.175

01:23:03.710 --> 01:23:04.910
Don't look baby. Don't look.

01:23:06.846 --> 01:23:07.846
Keep your head up.

01:23:10.583 --> 01:23:11.984

01:24:18.017 --> 01:24:20.178
Could not have seen a
more beautiful sunrise.

01:24:29.062 --> 01:24:30.896
What happens tonight?

01:24:31.264 --> 01:24:33.565

01:24:36.136 --> 01:24:37.136
