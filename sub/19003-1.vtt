00:07.999 --> 00:09.633
There's growing concern today about

00:09.634 --> 00:14.337
a Victoria woman who's been
missing for nearly a week.

00:14.338 --> 00:15.939
An extensive search is now underway

00:15.940 --> 00:19.409
for 21 year old Jessica Moore,
who was last seen

00:19.410 --> 00:23.346
leaving her apartment
at 1638 Edenhurst Avenue,

00:23.347 --> 00:25.850

00:38.596 --> 00:42.933
say that her disappearance is
totally out of Jessica's character.

00:42.934 --> 00:45.335
Now Jessica Moore is
described as approximately

you to be going to the beach?

02:33.511 --> 02:35.680
- I am so excited.
- Yeah?

02:36.581 --> 02:37.981
Can't wait to get in the sun.

02:37.982 --> 02:40.951
You gonna lather yourself up
with some sunblock?

02:42.453 --> 02:43.954
That fair skin there,
you don't wanna burn it.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.522
Yeah, I'm a little burnt already though

02:45.523 --> 02:46.990
so you can get some on that.

Oh yes.

02:53.430 --> 02:55.231
- You know where to find me.
- Sure.

02:55.232 --> 02:56.199
Matt, that's okay, buddy?

02:56.200 --> 02:58.369
Yeah, we get it, thanks.

03:02.439 --> 03:06.409
Is Matt not taking care of business?

03:06.410 --> 03:10.246
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
Matt, Matt.

03:10.247 --> 03:13.449
Tell me you've been taking
care of business, buddy.

03:13.450 --> 03:14.751
Go away, Trevor.

03:14.752 --> 03:16.787
What the hell is a matter with you, man?

03:27.699 --> 03:29.633
This is a very expensive
piece of machinery.

03:29.634 --> 03:32.302
Get that camera away from me.

03:34.405 --> 03:35.239
Oh.

03:45.316 --> 03:48.385
Give them a show, give them a show.

03:49.453 --> 03:50.354
Oh, woah.

03:52.123 --> 03:53.924
See that Yvette?

03:53.925 --> 03:55.660
There's a good sport.

03:58.295 --> 04:00.597
She likes you, John.

04:00.598 --> 04:01.865
Really?

04:01.866 --> 04:04.801
Buddy, you are so tapping that ass.

04:28.626 --> 04:29.627
Damn kids.

04:31.228 --> 04:32.696
That was awesome.

04:32.697 --> 04:33.598
Oh great.

04:35.833 --> 04:37.602
Engine's overheating.

04:39.403 --> 04:40.871
We're gonna have to pull over.

04:40.872 --> 04:42.072
Perfect.

04:42.073 --> 04:45.275
I've got to get a closer look
at those tits.

04:45.276 --> 04:47.779
I gotta get out of this van.

05:06.698 --> 05:09.801
So, Lauren, how about another peek?

05:11.335 --> 05:12.504
Maybe later.

05:13.404 --> 05:15.338
I'll hold you to it.

05:15.339 --> 05:16.773
Look, I probably shouldn't tell you this

05:16.774 --> 05:20.343
but she couldn't stop talking
about you in that truck.

05:20.344 --> 05:21.845
Who, Lauren?

05:21.846 --> 05:23.279
Dude, she likes John.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.816
No man, she likes you.

05:25.817 --> 05:27.718
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:27.719 --> 05:29.820
No dipshit, she hates you.

05:29.821 --> 05:32.990
We all do.

05:34.759 --> 05:35.593
Dick.

05:43.668 --> 05:45.035
This thing gonna make it?

05:45.036 --> 05:45.869
Yep.

05:45.870 --> 05:46.870
Need any help?

05:46.871 --> 05:47.705
No.

05:48.773 --> 05:51.843
Alright, nice talking to you Matthew.

05:55.279 --> 05:56.479
And you should really
stop screwing around

05:56.480 --> 05:58.882
on those highways, Luke.

05:58.883 --> 06:00.016
It's dangerous.

06:00.017 --> 06:00.852
Yes sir.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.162
Look at that.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.564
You think she's wasting her time?

06:13.565 --> 06:17.735
I'd love to find out.

06:18.803 --> 06:21.137
Hey, is everything okay?

06:21.138 --> 06:21.973
Yeah.

06:24.341 --> 06:25.275
I really wish you would have asked them

06:25.276 --> 06:27.611
before you brought me along.

06:27.612 --> 06:29.713
I kind of get the
feeling I'm not welcome.

06:29.714 --> 06:32.516
Don't be silly, everyone loves you.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.884
Yeah.

06:33.885 --> 06:36.953
The guy with the camera's great.

06:36.954 --> 06:40.090
Don't worry about Trevor,
he's just a smartass.

06:40.091 --> 06:41.892
Hey guys, you gotta come check this out,

06:41.893 --> 06:43.594
this is awesome.

06:43.595 --> 06:45.862
He is not smart.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.198
Trevor stay away from there, man.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.365
Why?

06:49.366 --> 06:51.702
Because it's probably private property.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.403
No, it's not.

06:53.404 --> 06:55.739
Just stay nearby.

06:55.740 --> 06:58.810
Just get the stick out of your ass.

07:04.248 --> 07:06.449
Hey, is it gonna be okay?

07:06.450 --> 07:07.785
Yeah, I think.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.721
It just needs to cool a bit.

07:10.722 --> 07:11.722
Well, let me know if there's anything

07:11.723 --> 07:13.790
I can do to help.

07:13.791 --> 07:15.325
Hey, the girls and I are gonna go pee.

07:15.326 --> 07:16.393
Can I come?

07:17.562 --> 07:19.930
How did he hear that?

07:19.931 --> 07:21.732
I'm gonna kill him.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.669
Yvette will probably do it first.

08:26.463 --> 08:27.298
Trevor.

08:28.432 --> 08:30.233
You scared the shit out of me, man.

08:30.234 --> 08:32.869
That old church isn't
gonna hurt you, boy.

08:32.870 --> 08:36.006
I don't know, I don't like church.

08:36.006 --> 08:38.308
Afraid of your own mortality?

08:38.308 --> 08:39.510
What do you mean?

08:39.510 --> 08:41.010
I don't know.

08:41.011 --> 08:43.614
The church reminds people
that they're gonna die.

08:43.615 --> 08:44.848
The old man upstairs is looking down

08:44.849 --> 08:46.349
on them and if they're not good,

08:46.350 --> 08:48.586
he might just, take 'em up.

08:50.354 --> 08:52.957
No, I just think it's boring.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.729
Hey let me have some.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.734
Come on, come on.

09:14.879 --> 09:16.548
You wanna go inside.

09:17.582 --> 09:19.750
I've already been in there.

09:19.751 --> 09:21.317
Hey guys.

09:21.318 --> 09:23.319
What is it, Pauly?

09:23.320 --> 09:25.722
Matt wants to leave in 10 minutes.

09:25.723 --> 09:27.624
Everybody needs to come back.

09:27.625 --> 09:29.893
Well he's just gonna have to wait,
cause I'm gonna go inside.

09:29.894 --> 09:31.962
Trevor here wants to
repent for all his sins.

09:31.963 --> 09:33.296
What about you Paul?

09:33.297 --> 09:35.132
Yeah, come on Pauly.

09:38.402 --> 09:42.305
So Lauren, you gonna rape John or what?

09:42.306 --> 09:46.409
Very funny.

09:46.410 --> 09:47.644
What?

09:47.645 --> 09:49.212
Well, I know you've heard what they say.

09:49.213 --> 09:50.514
He's not gay.

09:50.515 --> 09:51.982
I can tell.

09:51.983 --> 09:54.518
Well, I guess you'll
be the first to find out.

09:54.519 --> 09:55.986
Or maybe you can just find out.

09:55.987 --> 09:57.988
Like you did with Luke.

09:57.989 --> 09:59.322
That's not true.

09:59.323 --> 10:00.591
You know what they say.

10:00.592 --> 10:03.861
Well it's not true so shut up about it.

10:05.262 --> 10:07.798
Okay, so John isn't
gay and Nicky didn't fool

10:07.799 --> 10:10.433
around with Luke behind Matt's back.

10:10.434 --> 10:12.035
Are we good?

10:12.036 --> 10:13.570
Because I can't handle Trevor alone with

10:13.571 --> 10:15.573
the two of you fighting.

10:17.008 --> 10:19.442
Besides, it's a good thing
Nicky didn't fool around

10:19.443 --> 10:21.011
with Luke.

10:21.012 --> 10:21.846
Why?

10:23.347 --> 10:25.882
Because I want that.

10:33.357 --> 10:36.359
Oh hey, let's switch places
for the rest of the trip.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.293
Done.

10:37.294 --> 10:38.228
Enjoy Trevor.

10:50.207 --> 10:52.544
It's spooky, huh?

12:00.978 --> 12:02.479
Man I hate this.

12:05.016 --> 12:08.018
You know, God really screwed
us in the urination department.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.220
I know, guys can go anywhere.

12:10.221 --> 12:11.254
Is that penis envy?

12:11.255 --> 12:13.190
Yeah, big penis envy.

12:17.161 --> 12:19.362
Hey, is there someone?

12:19.363 --> 12:20.197
What?

12:24.001 --> 12:26.236
Just thought I saw something.

12:26.237 --> 12:27.470
I'm done.

12:27.471 --> 12:29.339
Just a second, I had like six bottles

12:29.340 --> 12:30.874
of water this morning.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.475
I'm on this new diet by the way,

12:32.476 --> 12:33.710
I drink a whole lot of water

12:33.711 --> 12:36.913
and it fills me up so I eat less.

12:36.914 --> 12:38.915
That doesn't sound very safe.

12:38.916 --> 12:42.352
Forget safe, what about water weight?

12:42.353 --> 12:46.322
I don't know but it's working, done.

12:57.602 --> 12:58.435
Trevor?

13:11.516 --> 13:12.349
Hello?

13:21.325 --> 13:22.159
Trevor?

13:40.111 --> 13:42.212
Oh Pauly, Pauly, you should have seen

13:42.213 --> 13:44.247
your face, man.

13:44.248 --> 13:45.415
Well, you will see your face.

13:45.416 --> 13:48.151
I mean, your sister's gonna love this.

13:48.152 --> 13:49.119
Hysterical.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.987
Oh man, I had you going.

13:50.988 --> 13:53.657
Oh man, that weed is
starting to kick in.

13:53.658 --> 13:56.828
Hey Pauly, you know, it's just a joke.

13:59.831 --> 14:02.132
God damn man, my camera.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.700
It was a birthday present.

14:03.701 --> 14:07.037
Come on man, quit being a little bitch.

14:07.038 --> 14:08.304
You know you gotta sacrifice something

14:08.305 --> 14:11.675
when you're getting right with the lord.

14:17.081 --> 14:18.314
Feel better, guys?

14:18.315 --> 14:19.983
You complained so much
about having to go pee.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.153
So much better.

14:23.420 --> 14:25.856
Where do you think the guys are?

14:25.857 --> 14:27.057
Getting us food?

14:27.058 --> 14:28.893
Yeah right.

14:42.607 --> 14:44.108
Everything okay?

14:50.948 --> 14:53.149
Just overheated engine.

14:53.150 --> 14:53.918
Oh man.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.022
Look alive boys.

15:01.292 --> 15:02.126
Shit.

15:06.297 --> 15:07.631
Gentlemen.

15:07.632 --> 15:08.799
Afternoon Officer.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.066
Hi.

15:10.067 --> 15:13.103
What, what were you
boys doing over there?

15:13.104 --> 15:15.305
We were just starting
to look around, sir.

15:15.306 --> 15:18.341
That there is private property, boys.

15:18.342 --> 15:21.211
We find a lot of vandals over the years.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.314
We're not vandals, sir.

15:30.421 --> 15:32.022
What you doing with that camera?

15:32.023 --> 15:35.559
Oh, city boy's never
seen a ghost town before.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.695
I was just, we were getting,

15:38.696 --> 15:40.297
having a look with.

15:44.135 --> 15:46.904
I'm just messing with you, son.

15:48.372 --> 15:49.206
Ladies.

15:56.147 --> 15:57.614
Hello.

15:57.615 --> 15:58.448
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:58.449 --> 15:59.283
Hi.

16:00.451 --> 16:02.118
So, I think we're gonna need some water

16:02.119 --> 16:03.787
for this engine.

16:03.788 --> 16:06.222
I don't think I can make it
much further in this heat.

16:06.223 --> 16:07.891
Oh well, yeah, we can,

16:07.892 --> 16:09.760
we can get a tow truck out here.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.596
It might be a while,
the town's a way's away.

16:17.168 --> 16:18.002
Oh man.

16:19.403 --> 16:21.605
You know, it might be
awhile on that tow truck.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.173
Your best bet, you take this road

16:23.174 --> 16:26.109
a quarter mile down FM15, hang a left,

16:26.110 --> 16:27.644
that'll take you to a hunting lodge.

16:27.645 --> 16:31.515
Should be someone there
to give y'all a hand.

16:31.516 --> 16:33.084
Y'all be safe, now.

16:43.027 --> 16:45.029
I'm so high right now.

17:00.411 --> 17:04.582
There's growing concern today about a.

17:09.521 --> 17:10.721
I'm flirting with you.

17:10.722 --> 17:11.755
I know.

17:11.756 --> 17:13.925
Do you like it?

17:53.798 --> 17:55.933
You think anyone's home?

17:58.469 --> 18:02.639
Think anyone's home?

18:02.640 --> 18:05.242
You should have seen your face.

18:06.443 --> 18:07.512
Come on, man.

18:27.499 --> 18:29.501
Is anyone home, y'all?

18:31.969 --> 18:32.804
Hello?

18:36.574 --> 18:37.408
Trevor.

18:39.476 --> 18:40.911
Guys!

18:40.912 --> 18:44.080
Nobody's home, come on.

18:44.081 --> 18:47.283
This seems just a little illegal.

18:47.284 --> 18:48.885
Just a little.

18:48.886 --> 18:51.021
Guys, we're cool, nobody's home.

18:51.022 --> 18:51.956
It's Texas.

19:03.868 --> 19:06.469
This place is freaking sweet.

19:06.470 --> 19:09.473
This place is freaking disgusting.

19:10.908 --> 19:13.144
These poor, poor animals.

19:14.345 --> 19:15.612
What, you don't eat cheeseburgers?

19:15.613 --> 19:18.783
I don't put their heads on my walls.

19:34.398 --> 19:35.232
Texas.

19:46.778 --> 19:48.680
Ah, come on, no beer?

19:49.881 --> 19:52.649
What kind of hunting lodge is this, man?

19:53.585 --> 19:55.820
Good thing I brought my own.

20:05.797 --> 20:08.064
I'll work on your engine.

20:14.872 --> 20:17.041
Lauren, how bout a beer?

20:18.943 --> 20:20.644
Thank you.

20:20.645 --> 20:22.245
Heads up.

20:22.246 --> 20:23.080
Oh shit.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.250
Now that's spring break.

20:27.251 --> 20:29.553
Yeah, breaking and
entering and warm beer.

20:29.554 --> 20:31.454
When in Texas, my friend.

20:31.455 --> 20:32.557
Ladies, beer?

20:34.692 --> 20:36.159
Yeah, I'll take one.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.260
They're warm.

20:37.261 --> 20:38.895
Pass.

20:38.896 --> 20:41.565
I can see you're gonna be a lot of fun.

20:41.566 --> 20:43.333
Hey does anyone have cell reception?

20:43.334 --> 20:45.168
There's no phone inside.

20:45.169 --> 20:47.771
Dude, I haven't had
cell reception in hours.

20:47.772 --> 20:48.905
No.

20:48.906 --> 20:50.206
Nope.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.041
Nada.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.376
Wait a minute.

20:56.581 --> 20:59.516
Got one but it's not much.

20:59.517 --> 21:01.519
Let me see your phone.

21:05.957 --> 21:06.791
Boo.

21:07.692 --> 21:09.025
What you doing?

21:09.026 --> 21:12.696
Nothing, I'm just drawing a little bit.

21:12.697 --> 21:14.131
Ah, the artist.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.400
Something like that.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.235
Sip.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.406
Can I take a peek?

21:23.407 --> 21:26.009
I usually don't let people look at it.

21:26.010 --> 21:30.014
Do you think we're going
to the beach tonight?

21:30.882 --> 21:31.716
No.

21:33.885 --> 21:35.485
I have an idea.

21:35.486 --> 21:36.787
What?

21:36.788 --> 21:37.688
Want it back?

21:37.689 --> 21:39.023
Come and get it.

22:12.356 --> 22:16.493
So, why are you
working on Matt's engine?

22:16.494 --> 22:19.530
I don't know, I guess I'm just better

22:19.531 --> 22:21.898
at getting things started.

22:21.899 --> 22:23.433
So you say.

22:23.434 --> 22:26.102
Well, other people say.

22:26.103 --> 22:27.104
Oh really?

22:28.506 --> 22:30.306
Well you know, anybody
can get something started,

22:30.307 --> 22:34.078
it's keeping it running
that's the hard part.

22:36.280 --> 22:40.216
You know Yvette, I agree with you there.

22:40.217 --> 22:41.618
I find things aren't able to keep up

22:41.619 --> 22:43.621
with my aggressive pace.

22:45.723 --> 22:47.624
Oh is that so?

22:47.625 --> 22:49.293
So I've been told.

22:51.328 --> 22:55.432
Well, maybe, you just
haven't found the right fit.

22:59.504 --> 23:00.337
Maybe.

23:02.740 --> 23:03.575
Hey.

23:06.410 --> 23:07.912
Aggressive pace.

23:29.333 --> 23:30.835
Just keeping up.

24:23.555 --> 24:24.889
You scared me.

24:29.026 --> 24:30.862
I didn't see anything.

24:33.230 --> 24:34.065
Hey.

25:04.095 --> 25:04.929
Jesus.

25:06.063 --> 25:07.498
You scared me.

25:07.499 --> 25:08.765
What are you doing?

25:08.766 --> 25:12.035
I'm just getting to know our host.

25:12.036 --> 25:13.504
And?

25:13.505 --> 25:14.338
Nothing.

25:15.907 --> 25:16.741
Cozy.

25:24.749 --> 25:25.583
What?

25:27.451 --> 25:29.085
Come on, we shouldn't be in here.

25:29.086 --> 25:29.921
Alright.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.925
You're too good for me.

25:35.359 --> 25:38.829
Hey, you're not mad that I
brought Paul along, are you?

25:38.830 --> 25:40.764
He doesn't have very
many friends, you know.

25:40.765 --> 25:42.099
No, it's fine.

26:24.876 --> 26:25.710
Hey.

26:39.924 --> 26:41.324
Shut up.

26:41.325 --> 26:42.827
Beginner's luck.

26:44.796 --> 26:45.929
Honestly.

26:45.930 --> 26:47.731
Who's winning?

26:47.732 --> 26:48.932
Shut up.

26:48.933 --> 26:50.167
Alright Paul.

26:51.903 --> 26:53.837
Has anyone seen Luke?

26:53.838 --> 26:57.708
Yeah, he's taking care of business.

26:57.709 --> 26:58.942
What?

26:58.943 --> 26:59.976
Dude, that was gonna go in, man.

26:59.977 --> 27:01.545
When did he leave?

27:01.546 --> 27:03.213
Just after John and
Lauren went frolicking off

27:03.214 --> 27:05.282
into the woods to frolic.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.918
John left too?

27:07.919 --> 27:09.185
What is this, the inquisition?

27:09.186 --> 27:11.487
Come on, Matt, let them have their fun.

27:11.488 --> 27:15.492
You know, some people like
taking care of business.

27:15.493 --> 27:17.060
What'd I tell you guys, huh?

27:17.061 --> 27:18.461
Big stick up his ass.

27:18.462 --> 27:19.996
Shut up Trevor.

27:19.997 --> 27:22.232
Stop calling it taking care of business.

27:22.233 --> 27:23.500
It's stupid.

27:23.501 --> 27:27.071
No, not taking care
of business is stupid.

27:29.774 --> 27:30.608
God.

27:36.247 --> 27:37.081
What?

27:38.550 --> 27:39.383
Nothing.

27:42.654 --> 27:44.255
What are you doing?

27:45.256 --> 27:46.090
I'm hot.

27:50.895 --> 27:53.697
The others are probably looking for us.

27:53.698 --> 27:54.932
They're fine.

27:58.836 --> 28:00.671
We should go back.

28:00.672 --> 28:04.676
Don't you wanna stay
here for awhile, with me?

28:20.291 --> 28:22.959
Is that what you think it is?

28:22.960 --> 28:25.530
Well, you're always so quiet.

28:27.832 --> 28:31.068
I mean, people say you're a little shy.

28:33.738 --> 28:35.740
Is that what they say?

28:38.776 --> 28:41.411
Have you heard what
they're saying about Luke

28:41.412 --> 28:42.846
and Nicky?

28:42.847 --> 28:45.649
It's not true, Nicky told me so.

28:45.650 --> 28:47.884
Well she's lying.

28:47.885 --> 28:50.320
Just like you're lying to me.

28:50.321 --> 28:51.688
I'm not lying to you.

28:51.689 --> 28:53.990
Then tell me what they really say.

28:53.991 --> 28:54.826
About me.

28:56.661 --> 28:59.163
Okay, but you can't get mad.

29:04.368 --> 29:06.470
They say that you're gay.

29:12.443 --> 29:13.277
John?

29:20.317 --> 29:22.452
What was that?

29:22.453 --> 29:23.287
Us.

29:29.326 --> 29:30.161
John?

29:31.496 --> 29:32.329
I'm sorry.

29:34.265 --> 29:35.099
Hello?

30:04.428 --> 30:05.262
Hello?

30:08.566 --> 30:09.900
Alright, I heard something.

30:09.901 --> 30:10.735
No.

30:19.944 --> 30:22.679
This place gives me the creeps.

30:22.680 --> 30:23.515
I'm done.

30:27.552 --> 30:28.886
What the hell?

30:29.954 --> 30:31.122
What about me?

30:32.690 --> 30:34.926
Oh, guess you were right.

30:36.794 --> 30:38.062
Too aggressive.

30:41.633 --> 30:42.466
John?

31:00.918 --> 31:01.719
Bitch.

31:25.543 --> 31:26.843
What are you doing?

31:26.844 --> 31:28.545
The hell does it look like I'm doing?

31:28.546 --> 31:30.847
John and Lauren are gone.

31:30.848 --> 31:34.250
Well I'm sure they're not far.

31:34.251 --> 31:37.822
Why don't you go scare
the shit outta them?

31:39.624 --> 31:41.124
It's getting late.

31:41.125 --> 31:43.294
What does it matter now?

32:17.662 --> 32:19.062
It's getting late.

32:19.063 --> 32:20.497
I know.

32:20.498 --> 32:22.265
So much for the beach.

32:22.266 --> 32:24.635
Shouldn't your friends be back by now?

32:24.636 --> 32:26.638
I'm sure they're fine.

32:28.205 --> 32:29.541
Seems strange.

32:30.742 --> 32:33.477
So, what do you think about Matt?

32:35.412 --> 32:37.081
Seems nice enough.

32:38.616 --> 32:41.185
I can tell when you're lying.

32:47.358 --> 32:49.760
Well, it's official.

32:49.761 --> 32:51.261
Matt's truck's dead.

32:51.262 --> 32:52.796
So what are we gonna do now?

32:52.797 --> 32:55.165
Find Lauren and John and
get the hell outta here.

32:55.166 --> 32:57.467
Hey Lauren and John'll find
us when they're finished,

32:57.468 --> 33:01.037
alright, I just say we
hang tight till morning.

33:01.038 --> 33:04.007
Oh that's a brilliant
idea, thank you, Trevor.

33:04.008 --> 33:05.542
What?

33:05.543 --> 33:07.077
We're not gonna make it to
the beach tonight, honey,

33:07.078 --> 33:09.846
okay and we're not all gonna
fit in Luke's truck either.

33:09.847 --> 33:12.215
That is, unless you
wanna ride in the back.

33:12.216 --> 33:14.250
Well I don't really wanna stay here.

33:14.251 --> 33:16.319
We've been lucky no one's come home.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.288
Yeah, I agree.

33:18.289 --> 33:19.356
We should go.

33:24.629 --> 33:26.462
What was that?

33:26.463 --> 33:27.297
What?

33:27.298 --> 33:28.132
Shh!

33:30.635 --> 33:32.368
What was that?

33:37.274 --> 33:38.308
Coyote.

33:38.309 --> 33:39.577
Are you sure?

33:41.012 --> 33:43.647
We need to find John and Lauren.

33:43.648 --> 33:45.415
I'm not going out there
with a bunch of wild animals

33:45.416 --> 33:47.117
running around.

33:47.118 --> 33:50.320
Hey, what happened to your faces?

33:50.321 --> 33:53.525
You two look, you kind of look beat up.

33:56.227 --> 33:58.162
I'll go look for 'em.

34:03.568 --> 34:04.401
Alright.

34:12.176 --> 34:13.744
Want me to go with you?

34:13.745 --> 34:15.245
I'll be fine.

34:15.246 --> 34:16.581
Make it quick.

34:17.414 --> 34:19.916
Something isn't right.

34:19.917 --> 34:20.752
Yes sir.

34:30.061 --> 34:30.895
Boo.

34:39.436 --> 34:41.237
Shouldn't one of us go with him?

34:41.237 --> 34:45.742
No, we should be here
in case they come back.

34:45.743 --> 34:49.480
God, I hate this.

34:53.985 --> 34:55.686
You're cheating, Trevor.

34:55.687 --> 34:56.887
How am I cheating?

34:56.888 --> 34:58.188
You don't play that way.

34:58.189 --> 34:59.656
Yes you do.

34:59.657 --> 35:01.191
Nick, Nick, just let
him play it his way, okay.

35:01.192 --> 35:03.259
He already had his ass handed to him

35:03.260 --> 35:04.895
in pool, he just wants to win something.

35:04.896 --> 35:07.931
Oh, you know, okay, I
didn't do that bad, alright?

35:07.932 --> 35:10.100
And I hadn't played in eons.

35:10.101 --> 35:11.234
Well it would seem
that you haven't played

35:11.235 --> 35:12.869
this in eons either.

35:12.870 --> 35:14.471
Nice one, Yvette.

35:16.173 --> 35:17.941
Nice one Yvette.

35:17.942 --> 35:19.510
Very mature.

35:19.511 --> 35:20.343
Give me that.

35:20.344 --> 35:21.345
Woah, hey.

35:23.447 --> 35:24.915
Can we have some better
music in here, please?

35:24.916 --> 35:28.351
That radio only plays
AM stations out here.

35:28.352 --> 35:30.186
Who listens to this crap?

35:30.187 --> 35:32.023
Um, look around you.

35:38.229 --> 35:39.896
There's growing concern today about

35:39.897 --> 35:43.399
a Victoria woman who's been
missing for nearly a week.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.068
An extensive search is now underway

35:45.069 --> 35:48.471
for 21 year old Jessica
Moore who was last seen

35:48.472 --> 35:52.408
leaving her apartment
at 1638 Edenhurst Avenue

35:52.409 --> 35:54.277
on the afternoon of March 8th.

35:54.278 --> 35:56.513
At this point, police
are considering the case

35:56.514 --> 35:59.149
to be suspicious and
the family members say

35:59.150 --> 36:01.284
that her disappearance is totally out

36:01.285 --> 36:03.220
of Jessica's character.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.034
Proverbs 13:32,

36:19.403 --> 36:20.237
the verse.

36:25.943 --> 36:29.880
It's a little heavy
for spring break, huh?

36:29.881 --> 36:32.282
You read the bible?

36:32.283 --> 36:34.519
Sometimes, do you?

36:37.188 --> 36:38.022
Yeah.

36:42.026 --> 36:46.396
Look, I hope it's
okay that I came along.

36:46.397 --> 36:50.734
Nicky invited me, said
she wanted me to come.

36:50.735 --> 36:52.169
Said it was okay.

36:54.839 --> 36:58.009
Yeah, she has a tendency to do that.

37:00.144 --> 37:01.746
Yeah, I guess so.

37:04.816 --> 37:06.250
It's okay Paul.

37:10.287 --> 37:12.123
It's Proverbs 14:32.

37:13.891 --> 37:15.091
What?

37:15.092 --> 37:18.029
The passage, it's Proverbs 14:32.

37:19.296 --> 37:20.131
Not 13:32.

37:29.273 --> 37:30.675
Do it, come on.

37:33.277 --> 37:36.279
Would you stop going so slow?

37:36.280 --> 37:38.849
Are we.

37:38.850 --> 37:42.186
Are we even sure we wanna get him drunk?

39:20.985 --> 39:23.253
What are you doing?

39:23.254 --> 39:24.589
Just watching.

39:27.158 --> 39:30.460
I'm sorry for dragging you with me.

39:30.461 --> 39:33.798
No, this has been a great trip so far.

39:37.434 --> 39:40.437
Shut up.

39:44.175 --> 39:46.209
Oh Pauly, Pauly, you should've seen

39:46.210 --> 39:47.378
your face man.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.681
Are you ready to be delivered?

39:50.682 --> 39:51.516
What?

39:53.551 --> 39:56.721
Are you ready to be delivered?

40:00.725 --> 40:03.227
Are you ready to be delivered?

40:24.849 --> 40:26.149
Hey, who is it?

40:26.150 --> 40:27.518
I don't see anyone.

40:27.519 --> 40:29.119
What if it's the owner of this place?

40:29.120 --> 40:30.787
Shit.

40:30.788 --> 40:34.792
It's probably just Luke
messing with us, guys.

40:54.646 --> 40:55.913
See anything?

40:58.149 --> 40:58.983
No.

41:10.361 --> 41:12.428
What the hell is that?

41:12.429 --> 41:14.364
Okay, delivered.

41:14.365 --> 41:15.532
What?

41:15.533 --> 41:17.602
Matt, where's your car?

41:20.037 --> 41:22.005
It was dead before so how's it gone now?

41:22.006 --> 41:26.042
Okay, this is seriously
starting to freak me out.

41:26.043 --> 41:28.211
Are you really buying into this?

41:28.212 --> 41:30.246
I mean, come on, it's Luke, hello.

41:30.247 --> 41:32.215
Like it's written in mud.

41:32.216 --> 41:34.017
But why would he write that?

41:34.018 --> 41:35.318
He's been gone way too long

41:35.319 --> 41:37.555
to just be screwing around.

41:55.106 --> 41:57.307
Dude, okay, Luke got
me once today, alright,

41:57.308 --> 41:58.709
I'm not gonna fall for it again.

41:58.710 --> 42:00.110
Nicky do you still have your cell phone?

42:00.111 --> 42:01.945
You said you had a
little service earlier.

42:01.946 --> 42:02.847
My phone.

42:03.815 --> 42:05.049
It was in here.

42:06.117 --> 42:07.417
Where is it?

42:07.418 --> 42:08.885
Shit.

42:08.886 --> 42:09.920
Where's my phone?

42:09.921 --> 42:11.255
Oh my god, oh.

42:12.423 --> 42:13.957
Shut up Trevor.

42:13.958 --> 42:17.293
Dude, alright, it's Luke,
okay, that's all I'm saying.

42:17.294 --> 42:19.363
Okay where are you going?

42:24.902 --> 42:25.737
Matt?

42:28.172 --> 42:29.640
What are you looking at?

42:29.641 --> 42:31.141
What is it man, is that the boogeyman?

42:31.142 --> 42:32.442
Shut up Trevor.

42:32.443 --> 42:33.877
No, why don't you shut up, okay man

42:33.878 --> 42:35.979
cause you've been an
asshole this entire trip.

42:35.980 --> 42:36.814
Guys.

42:37.915 --> 42:39.149
Ah okay, show of hands,

42:39.150 --> 42:40.684
who here is tired of Matt's attitude?

42:40.685 --> 42:41.685
This isn't productive.

42:41.686 --> 42:42.986
Shut up Paul.

42:42.987 --> 42:44.487
Alright cause I came
on this trip to have

42:44.488 --> 42:47.824
a good time and all you
wanna do is ruin it for me.

42:47.825 --> 42:49.561
What the hell, man?

43:05.209 --> 43:08.111
It's coming from out there, somewhere.

43:08.112 --> 43:09.680
From a car radio?

43:09.681 --> 43:11.247
Possibly.

43:11.248 --> 43:13.083
This is not Luke.

43:13.084 --> 43:16.052
The outside lights are still working.

43:16.053 --> 43:18.021
That's strange.

43:18.022 --> 43:19.389
I'm going out there.

43:19.390 --> 43:20.557
- What?
- What?

43:20.558 --> 43:22.926
I'm going out there.

43:22.927 --> 43:24.861
It may be Luke or John.

43:24.862 --> 43:27.932
Yeah, that's what I've been saying.

43:32.236 --> 43:36.407
♪ Pardon me, I've got someone to kill ♪

43:42.379 --> 43:46.551
♪ I warned him not to try
and take her from me ♪

43:52.023 --> 43:56.127
♪ He laughed and said if I can,
you know I will ♪

44:11.943 --> 44:12.909
What the hell?

44:12.910 --> 44:14.010
Be quiet.

44:14.011 --> 44:15.178
That isn't Luke.

44:15.179 --> 44:16.346
That is not Luke, a fucking gun.

44:16.347 --> 44:17.380
We gotta get outta here.

44:17.381 --> 44:18.314
Matt.

44:18.315 --> 44:19.550
Oh my god, Matt's out there.

44:19.551 --> 44:20.416
We have to help him.

44:20.417 --> 44:21.485
No, no, no.

44:22.820 --> 44:26.057
We don't know if
anyone's been shot, okay.

44:27.659 --> 44:29.693
We have to get out of this lodge.

44:29.694 --> 44:31.361
There's a truck.

44:31.362 --> 44:32.295
Where?

44:32.296 --> 44:34.831
Out back in the old barn.

44:34.832 --> 44:35.767
Let's go.

44:36.634 --> 44:37.468
Come on.

44:42.339 --> 44:43.908
Trevor, let's go.

44:46.744 --> 44:48.712
It's not here.

44:48.713 --> 44:49.913
It was right here before.

44:49.914 --> 44:51.014
Big surprise.

44:51.015 --> 44:52.549
Shut up Trevor.

44:52.550 --> 44:54.751
So what are we gonna do now?

44:54.752 --> 44:56.853
Let's see if anybody can
find a light or something.

44:56.854 --> 44:59.623
There might be something
here we can use.

44:59.624 --> 45:00.725
Weapon maybe.

45:21.513 --> 45:23.014
What'd you find?

45:24.215 --> 45:26.316
It's a bunch of driver's licenses.

45:26.317 --> 45:28.585
Guys, I found a lantern.

45:28.586 --> 45:30.922
See if you can turn it on.

45:33.124 --> 45:34.892
They're all female.

45:40.498 --> 45:41.332
What?

45:43.100 --> 45:46.771
This is the girl, the
girl that's missing.

45:47.839 --> 45:49.339
Hey guys, I got it.

45:52.544 --> 45:54.144
What the fuck?

45:54.145 --> 45:55.612
Is that John?

45:55.613 --> 45:56.681
Is that John?

46:04.121 --> 46:05.522
It's him.

46:10.628 --> 46:13.163
There's something written
on their foreheads.

46:13.164 --> 46:14.330
Delivered.

46:14.331 --> 46:16.066
Delivered?

46:18.736 --> 46:20.003
Their eyes are gone.

46:20.004 --> 46:21.237
What?

46:21.238 --> 46:22.506
Who is that other person?

46:22.507 --> 46:24.040
Who the hell is that?

46:24.041 --> 46:26.878
I don't know, it's an older man.

46:33.918 --> 46:35.687
Sir, can you hear me?

46:37.021 --> 46:37.854
Sinners.

46:37.855 --> 46:39.923
What did he say?

46:39.924 --> 46:41.492
Sinners.

46:41.493 --> 46:43.026
Sinners?

46:43.027 --> 46:44.528
Who?

46:44.529 --> 46:45.461
I don't know.

46:45.462 --> 46:48.032
Fucking Texas, fucking Texas.

46:52.136 --> 46:52.937
Nicky?

46:53.805 --> 46:54.871
The cell phone.

46:54.872 --> 46:56.773
It's in John's pocket.

46:56.774 --> 46:58.308
Bring it here.

46:58.309 --> 47:01.444
Let me see, I had some service earlier.

47:01.445 --> 47:02.579
It won't turn on.

47:02.580 --> 47:03.413
Here let me see it.

47:03.414 --> 47:04.248
Shit.

47:07.685 --> 47:09.720
Battery's gone.

48:25.930 --> 48:26.764
Hey look.

48:28.165 --> 48:30.668
There's somebody in the house.

48:31.803 --> 48:35.572
Well I'm not gonna go back there.

48:35.573 --> 48:36.707
Okay I'll go look.

48:36.708 --> 48:38.141
No.

48:38.142 --> 48:42.146
If it's one of the others,
we have to warn them.

49:27.224 --> 49:28.592
Run.

49:45.577 --> 49:48.411
Hey, so what did you see?

49:48.412 --> 49:49.780
It was the same guy as before.

49:49.781 --> 49:50.714
Was he shooting at us?

49:50.715 --> 49:51.648
I don't think so.

49:51.649 --> 49:53.750
How do you know?

49:53.751 --> 49:56.019
The guy I saw was inside the house,

49:56.020 --> 49:58.354
he was just sitting there.

49:58.355 --> 50:00.424
So what are you saying?

50:03.227 --> 50:04.260
There may be more than one.

50:04.261 --> 50:05.295
What?

50:05.296 --> 50:06.963
We gotta move, okay?

50:06.964 --> 50:07.798
Wait Trevor.

50:07.799 --> 50:08.633
Wait.

50:10.234 --> 50:11.535
You guys can talk
this out but I'm getting

50:11.536 --> 50:13.204
the hell outta here.

50:16.440 --> 50:17.908
We need to stick together, Trevor.

50:17.909 --> 50:19.744
No, we need to move.

50:21.613 --> 50:23.379
Trevor, wait.

50:23.380 --> 50:24.215
Slow down.

50:32.624 --> 50:33.457
Trevor?

50:42.667 --> 50:44.901
What the hell is that smell?

50:44.902 --> 50:45.737
Texas.

50:50.942 --> 50:53.443
Trevor, Trevor are you okay?

50:53.444 --> 50:55.946
Yeah, something broke my fall.

50:55.947 --> 50:57.614
What is all that?

50:57.615 --> 50:59.349
I don't...

50:59.350 --> 51:00.350
Can you guys get me out of here?

51:00.351 --> 51:02.118
It smells like ass down here.

51:02.119 --> 51:04.354
It's shit, Trevor.

51:04.355 --> 51:05.857
That's not shit.

51:12.396 --> 51:14.698
Guys, get me the fuck outta here.

51:14.699 --> 51:15.700
Hey, oh god.

51:16.568 --> 51:17.734
Hurry.

51:17.735 --> 51:20.070
Calm down, okay,
we're gonna get you out.

51:20.071 --> 51:21.739
Now, now.

51:23.274 --> 51:24.341
Oh god, it's.

51:26.744 --> 51:27.579
No now.

51:29.581 --> 51:30.914
Guys!

51:39.624 --> 51:41.658
Here, grab this.

51:41.659 --> 51:43.761
Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah.

51:49.834 --> 51:51.234
Stop, stop, shit.

51:51.235 --> 51:52.503
My leg's stuck.

51:52.504 --> 51:53.770
But we gotta get you outta there.

51:53.771 --> 51:56.373
Okay, just, just give me a second.

52:01.212 --> 52:02.046
Okay.

52:09.153 --> 52:11.054
Guys, what's going on?

52:13.625 --> 52:14.658
Be quiet.

52:14.659 --> 52:15.492
Someone's here.

52:15.493 --> 52:16.627
What?

52:16.628 --> 52:17.461
Shut up.

52:20.932 --> 52:22.365
Guys don't leave me here, come on,

52:22.366 --> 52:23.600
get me outta here.

52:23.601 --> 52:25.670
Look, we'll come back for you,
just be quiet.

52:28.405 --> 52:29.906
Shit.

52:29.907 --> 52:30.742
Fuck.

52:54.198 --> 52:55.032
Hey.

53:04.876 --> 53:06.443
What is he doing?

53:07.444 --> 53:09.013
He's helping him.

53:10.748 --> 53:12.684
Look, he's helping him.

53:14.819 --> 53:16.152
Come on.

53:16.153 --> 53:16.988
Wait.

53:31.035 --> 53:31.869
Come on.

53:37.374 --> 53:38.976
Stop, stop, wait.

53:40.545 --> 53:42.579
We gotta keep moving.

53:42.580 --> 53:44.516
I just need a second.

53:47.852 --> 53:50.121
We just, we just left them.

53:52.423 --> 53:53.457
Matt, Trevor.

53:56.293 --> 53:58.495
We just left them.

53:58.496 --> 54:00.998
What were we supposed to do?

54:02.634 --> 54:03.801
I feel sick.

54:07.839 --> 54:09.507
What do we do now?

54:10.608 --> 54:12.576
There's a house out there.

54:12.577 --> 54:14.645
Maybe there's somewhere we can hide.

54:14.646 --> 54:16.379
I don't wanna hide anymore.

54:16.380 --> 54:18.014
Look, I don't know where we are

54:18.015 --> 54:19.583
and I don't wanna keep running

54:19.584 --> 54:22.086
around out here anymore, okay.

54:23.788 --> 54:25.957
Now we have to get moving.

54:27.424 --> 54:28.926
Come on, let's go.

54:40.171 --> 54:41.005
Why?

54:47.111 --> 54:50.246
Why were their eyes removed?

54:50.247 --> 54:52.883
I don't wanna talk about it.

54:52.884 --> 54:55.552
We probably shouldn't talk at all.

54:55.553 --> 54:58.155
How long should we stay here?

54:59.524 --> 55:01.592
I don't know.

55:01.593 --> 55:05.362
Don't you think they
know about this place?

55:06.230 --> 55:07.164
Possibly.

55:09.100 --> 55:10.567
Probably.

55:10.568 --> 55:13.970
I don't know, I've never been
in a situation like this.

55:13.971 --> 55:15.139
I trust you.

55:16.440 --> 55:17.274
Me too.

55:22.179 --> 55:24.114
I'm gonna go look
around back, stay here.

55:24.115 --> 55:25.517
Don't leave us.

55:27.018 --> 55:28.753
I'll be right back.

56:25.109 --> 56:25.943
Paul.

57:09.854 --> 57:14.758
When calamity comes,
the wicked will bow down.

57:14.759 --> 57:17.694
But even in death, the
righteous have a refuge.

57:25.537 --> 57:27.871
All will be delivered.

59:30.495 --> 59:31.563
Hello Paul.

59:33.364 --> 59:34.598
What happened?

59:34.599 --> 59:36.132
Tell us what happened baby.

59:36.133 --> 59:38.702
They're gonna kill us.

59:38.703 --> 59:41.137
Who's gonna kill us?

59:41.138 --> 59:42.205
We can't wait here.

59:42.206 --> 59:43.473
We can't leave Paul.

59:43.474 --> 59:45.041
We're not leaving Paul.

59:45.042 --> 59:45.877
I know.

59:47.444 --> 59:48.279
Look.

01:00:45.269 --> 01:00:48.772
So, what do you think about Matt?

01:00:48.773 --> 01:00:50.974
Where's your car?

01:00:50.975 --> 01:00:53.744
You read the bible?

01:00:53.745 --> 01:00:55.646
Come on, it's Luke.

01:00:55.647 --> 01:00:57.882
I mean it's written in mud.

01:02:41.586 --> 01:02:42.419
Mark.

01:02:45.022 --> 01:02:47.859
He wasn't supposed to come back.

01:02:55.967 --> 01:02:57.969
My father sent him away.

01:03:00.838 --> 01:03:03.007
Told him not to come back.

01:03:09.847 --> 01:03:11.348
You're brothers.

01:03:14.185 --> 01:03:16.754
He killed John and my father.

01:03:21.693 --> 01:03:24.696
This trip wasn't mean for you, Paul.

01:03:27.298 --> 01:03:28.966
Where's my sister?

01:03:30.134 --> 01:03:32.203
God speaks to us, Paul.

01:03:35.006 --> 01:03:35.840
What?

01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:38.843
You read the bible.

01:03:41.478 --> 01:03:43.414
Can't you hear him now?

01:03:49.621 --> 01:03:50.688
In this room?

01:03:53.691 --> 01:03:54.492
Can you?

01:03:59.497 --> 01:04:01.499
I hear him everywhere.

01:04:04.902 --> 01:04:07.238
Does god tell you to kill?

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.742
Only the wicked.

01:04:14.378 --> 01:04:15.212
The Eves.

01:04:18.249 --> 01:04:19.883
The Eves.

01:04:19.884 --> 01:04:22.554
They poison the spirit of man.

01:04:26.323 --> 01:04:29.260
God told my father to deliver them.

01:04:30.562 --> 01:04:31.563
All of them.

01:04:34.398 --> 01:04:37.068
So this is your father's plan?

01:04:39.336 --> 01:04:41.105
Not God's, not yours.

01:04:47.311 --> 01:04:49.445
What about Trevor?

01:04:49.446 --> 01:04:51.215
Luke, he hates him.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.488
Luke loses control.

01:05:04.028 --> 01:05:08.699
The world has already
started to poison his mind.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:09.801
He's lustful.

01:05:12.336 --> 01:05:14.071
Luke and your sister.

01:05:20.678 --> 01:05:23.014
I thought she was different.

01:05:25.049 --> 01:05:27.484
I wanted her to be different.

01:05:31.956 --> 01:05:34.692
And he showed me that she wasn't.

01:05:36.393 --> 01:05:38.229
She was just the same.

01:05:42.634 --> 01:05:44.969
You don't have to do this.

01:05:48.039 --> 01:05:50.374
I do have to do this Paul.

01:05:53.377 --> 01:05:54.178
We do.

01:06:00.885 --> 01:06:01.819
Hey Paul.

01:06:28.913 --> 01:06:31.648
In the eyes, all sin begins.

01:06:31.649 --> 01:06:34.818
The eye causes you to sin, tear it out.

01:06:34.819 --> 01:06:36.887
For it is better to
enter the kingdom of God

01:06:36.888 --> 01:06:39.289
with one eye than with two eyes

01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:40.991
to be throw into hell.

01:06:40.992 --> 01:06:42.660
Stop, don't do it.

01:06:46.263 --> 01:06:48.099
You wanna be a hero?

01:06:51.268 --> 01:06:53.705
You'll get your chance, buddy.

01:06:54.706 --> 01:06:56.641
Look, look, look, look.

01:07:00.845 --> 01:07:03.515
Are you ready to be delivered?

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.122
Don't look, just don't look at it.

01:07:12.123 --> 01:07:12.957
Look.

01:07:14.258 --> 01:07:15.759
No.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:16.928
Yes, Trevor.

01:07:32.476 --> 01:07:35.612
Don't look, don't look at it.

01:07:35.613 --> 01:07:36.980
Look at me, okay.

01:07:36.981 --> 01:07:38.315
Just look at me.

01:07:47.058 --> 01:07:47.992
Don't look.

01:07:51.095 --> 01:07:51.929
Take this.

01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:54.666
Cut yourself free.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.642
Are you ready to be delivered?

01:08:05.643 --> 01:08:08.211
I think he's ready buddy.

01:08:08.212 --> 01:08:10.213
Get it over with.

01:08:10.214 --> 01:08:13.083
This isn't part of our
father's teachings.

01:08:13.084 --> 01:08:15.086
He had no imagination.

01:08:44.314 --> 01:08:47.919
That's what I call
taking care of business.

01:08:48.819 --> 01:08:50.154
Don't you think?

01:08:53.124 --> 01:08:54.457
Bring me Nicky.

01:09:04.468 --> 01:09:06.469
Your brother and father
got what they deserved.

01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:07.804
Be quiet.

01:09:09.807 --> 01:09:11.808
Your father brainwashed you.

01:09:11.809 --> 01:09:13.408
You're both fucking crazy.

01:09:16.881 --> 01:09:21.117
You don't know God,
you don't speak to God.

01:09:21.118 --> 01:09:22.453
Bring me Paul.

01:09:24.522 --> 01:09:25.857
Come on, Paul.

01:09:42.939 --> 01:09:44.942
This isn't God's work.

01:10:03.861 --> 01:10:05.963
Was that God's work Matt?

01:10:07.298 --> 01:10:09.901
What does God say about murder?

01:10:12.637 --> 01:10:16.808
What does God say about tying
someone up and cutting them?

01:10:21.946 --> 01:10:24.448
What does God say about liars?

01:10:25.983 --> 01:10:28.385
About the judgment of others?

01:10:32.156 --> 01:10:35.526
You sick fucks always
use God as an excuse

01:10:35.527 --> 01:10:39.697
to influence the weak, just
like your father did to you.

01:11:06.724 --> 01:11:08.225
Leave him alone!

01:11:23.508 --> 01:11:25.910
It won't start, shit, shit.

01:11:26.811 --> 01:11:28.379
Start, start, shit.

01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:35.019
You fucking piece of shit.

01:11:42.393 --> 01:11:45.329
You will pay for your sins, Matt.

01:11:47.164 --> 01:11:50.502
You all will pay for what you have done.

01:11:55.339 --> 01:11:57.073
Pop your hood, Yvette.

01:11:57.074 --> 01:11:59.676
I think the truck's overheating.

01:11:59.677 --> 01:12:00.911
Come on Yvette, why don't you crawl

01:12:00.912 --> 01:12:02.345
through your back window
where we can finish

01:12:02.346 --> 01:12:04.915
what we started, huh?

01:12:04.916 --> 01:12:06.550
Huh, huh?

01:12:06.551 --> 01:12:08.319
What about you Nicky?

01:12:09.987 --> 01:12:12.657
Still trying to convince yourself
it never happened?

01:12:15.192 --> 01:12:17.393
Was it too rough?

01:12:17.394 --> 01:12:19.731
You gotta get in line, slut.

01:12:21.633 --> 01:12:27.804
You'd be surprised how much that
little whore Lauren put up a fight.

01:12:27.805 --> 01:12:31.976
I've tasted all of you.

01:12:33.377 --> 01:12:36.580
Get out of the fucking
car, you fucking bitches.

01:12:36.581 --> 01:12:37.982
Get the fuck out.

01:12:40.652 --> 01:12:42.486
Open the fucking door.

01:13:03.875 --> 01:13:06.544
Are you ready to be delivered?

01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:28.865
This trip wasn't meant for you Paul.

01:13:28.866 --> 01:13:31.302
But you are not a man of God.

01:14:08.405 --> 01:14:09.339
No!

01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.274
Let's go.

01:14:11.442 --> 01:14:14.745
Nicky he's gone, come on, come on.

01:14:30.695 --> 01:14:31.529
Matt.

01:14:35.633 --> 01:14:36.467
You.

01:14:39.136 --> 01:14:41.639
You have destroyed everything.

01:14:46.611 --> 01:14:49.113
We were fulfilling God's will.

01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:54.752
Don't you understand that?

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.755
We were fulfilling dad's will.

01:14:58.756 --> 01:14:59.591
No.

01:15:02.159 --> 01:15:03.260
You're wrong.

01:15:04.829 --> 01:15:07.599
It's time we paid for our sins.

01:15:10.502 --> 01:15:11.936
They were evil.

01:15:14.606 --> 01:15:16.207
They were all evil.

01:15:19.544 --> 01:15:21.312
Don't you understand?

01:15:22.714 --> 01:15:26.518
You always believed in
what we were doing the most.

01:15:27.952 --> 01:15:29.621
He was our father.

01:15:32.023 --> 01:15:33.925
He wasn't our father.

01:17:06.283 --> 01:17:09.621
Are you sure you're supposed to be
chewing so much of that stuff, dad?

01:17:18.429 --> 01:17:19.263
Help!

01:17:57.602 --> 01:18:00.538
Wait, wait why are we going back?

01:18:02.974 --> 01:18:05.709
I don't wanna go back.

01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:08.212
Gotta check the crime scene.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.582
Isn't there somebody at the station
that can do that?

01:18:11.583 --> 01:18:13.350
We are the station.

01:18:14.686 --> 01:18:18.555

We wanna go now.
