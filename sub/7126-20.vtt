19:36.834 --> 19:38.333
Wait, I have something for you.

19:38.333 --> 19:39.917
Me too.

19:40.917 --> 19:42.834
- Sir.
- What? Dude, come on.

19:42.834 --> 19:45.500
- No.
- All right, fine, fine. Open it for me.

19:46.333 --> 19:48.291
Go on. There, there. Can I have that?

19:48.542 --> 19:50.083
Oh, man.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.667
- Will you marry me?
- Will you marry me?

19:55.875 --> 19:57.834
SAMANTHA:
<i>There's another kind of fairy tale.</i>

19:57.834 --> 20:02.834
<i>One built on star-crossed lovers</i>
<i>who fight against the evil empire,</i>

20:03.250 --> 20:05.500
<i>who find each other against all odds.</i>

20:05.500 --> 20:08.041
No one can ever know about this.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.875
Got it?

20:12.500 --> 20:13.917
Got it.

20:13.917 --> 20:17.208
- Now shut up and spoon me.
- Oh.

20:17.208 --> 20:18.917
- So nasty.
- Ahh.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.166
So where to?

20:21.166 --> 20:24.166
I've got 5 million frequent-flier miles
and two years of French.

20:24.166 --> 20:25.417
We're free.

20:25.417 --> 20:27.125
Nothing to tie us down.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.834
You hear that? We're free.

20:28.834 --> 20:31.834
You boys like your freedom.
Yes, you do.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.834
Time for somebody's pill, huh?

20:33.834 --> 20:36.208
Hey, Frank. Guess what.

20:36.583 --> 20:37.709
We're getting married.

20:37.917 --> 20:39.667
Well, I wish you luck.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.208
Aw, thanks, Frank.

20:41.208 --> 20:43.667
What--? What are you doing? Oh.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.041
Wait, hold on, hold on.
I have to get my keys.

20:47.041 --> 20:48.291
He has keys.

20:52.375 --> 20:55.709
Lots and lots and lots of luck.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.834
<i>That last one?</i>
<i>Now that's my kind of fairy tale.</i>

20:58.834 --> 21:00.709
<i>Where true love trumps all</i>

21:00.709 --> 21:03.333
<i>and they live happily ever after.</i>

21:03.333 --> 21:05.750
- Mom.
- I've left your father.

21:05.750 --> 21:07.500
Now, it's nothing you did.

21:07.834 --> 21:11.834
We both love you just the same,
we're just gonna live in different places.

21:11.834 --> 21:13.083
I'm gonna live here.

21:14.250 --> 21:17.041
But does everything
have to be so brown?

21:17.041 --> 21:18.458
Let's get some color in here.
