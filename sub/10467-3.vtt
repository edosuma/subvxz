00:10.053 --> 00:11.272
I SHOULD HAVE
CALLED YOU.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.838
N-NO. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.710
I HAD ANOTHER APPOINTMENT
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:14.710 --> 00:18.061
UM, LISTEN, I HAVE YOUR
COMPLAINT RIGHT HERE,

00:18.061 --> 00:20.585

00:43.347 --> 00:45.567
UH, ONE MORE THING.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.525
TELL ME THAT'S
NOT YOUR BILL.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.092
NO, NO.

00:49.092 --> 00:52.095
WE DO A ROUTINE
INVESTIGATION OF
THE OTHER PARTY

00:52.095 --> 00:55.403
IN CONJUNCTION WITH
ANY CUSTODY CASE.

00:55.403 --> 00:57.709
THIS BELONGS TO YOU.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.624
RIGHT.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.931

01:01.931 --> 01:05.891

PRETTY INTERESTING
STUFF IN THERE.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.284
GOOD LUCK, CHARLIE.

01:17.251 --> 01:18.730
WHO WAS THAT?

01:18.730 --> 01:19.992

01:19.992 --> 01:22.125

WHO DID IT.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.144

INEXPLICABLE,

02:24.144 --> 02:25.449

02:32.804 --> 02:35.677
SHE THINKS THESE
MOVIES ARE--I WANNA
GET THIS RIGHT--

02:35.677 --> 02:37.157
AN EXPLOITATION
OF WOMEN...

02:37.157 --> 02:39.115
A CELEBRATION
OF VIOLENCE,

02:39.115 --> 02:41.378
AND THE
ULTIMATE PROOF THAT AT OUR
LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR,

02:41.378 --> 02:44.555
NOTHING GETS
OUR JUICES FLOWING
LIKE PAIN AND CRUELTY.

02:44.555 --> 02:47.993
WELL, IF SHE'S GONNA BE
THAT WAY ABOUT IT...

02:47.993 --> 02:49.169
HEY.

I'LL GET OUT
OF YOUR WAY.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.706
UH, SHE SCARES
KIND OF EASY.

03:04.706 --> 03:07.230
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO HOLD ON
TIGHT.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.149

03:13.149 --> 03:15.369
I WANNA KILL
HIM, THE WAY
HE TREATED YOU.

03:15.369 --> 03:16.326

03:18.198 --> 03:20.504
OH, YEAH.
DEFINITELY.

03:20.504 --> 03:23.115
OK, SO THAT'S
EVERYTHING,
ISN'T IT?

03:23.115 --> 03:24.813
WELL,
WE KINDA COVERED
ALGEBRA, BIOLOGY--

03:24.813 --> 03:25.988
MR. ALSTON-JONES
WAS SICK,

03:25.988 --> 03:27.816
SO NO
ENGLISH LIT.

03:27.816 --> 03:31.036
AND FRENCH, BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT,
IS EVERY GIRL FOR HERSELF.

03:31.036 --> 03:32.299

03:32.299 --> 03:33.300

03:33.300 --> 03:34.692
ALL RIGHT.

03:38.522 --> 03:41.177
THIS IS TOO EASY,
THIS STUDY GROUP THING.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.874
SALINGER,
YOU'RE A WHIZ.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.833
WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY?

03:44.833 --> 03:46.748
EXCEPT, WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO TONIGHT?

03:48.184 --> 03:49.620
THURSDAY NIGHT...

03:49.620 --> 03:51.361
WELL, SOME CLUB IN TOWN'S GOT TO
HAVE SOME MUSIC

03:51.361 --> 03:52.928
OR SOMETHING,
DON'T THEY?

03:52.928 --> 03:55.800
OH, RIGHT. A LOT OF HOT
BANDS REALLY START COOKIN'

03:55.800 --> 03:57.062
BEFORE OUR
9:00 CURFEW.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.281
WE COULD SNEAK.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.891
NO. NO, WE COULDN'T.

03:59.891 --> 04:02.329
REALLY? YOU THINK
6 TEEN-AGE GIRLS

04:02.329 --> 04:03.547
MARCHING THROUGH
THE MAIN GATE,

04:03.547 --> 04:05.245
YOU THINK SOMEONE
WOULD NOTICE?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.985
UNLESS YOU SNUCK
BETWEEN BUNKER HALL

04:06.985 --> 04:08.813
AND THE KEYSER
ATHLETIC BUILDING,

04:08.813 --> 04:11.033
WHICH SORT OF LETS YOU OUT
AT THE BUS STOP ON DILBY STREET.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.122
SO IF YOU WENT
THROUGH THE WINDOW
IN THE BATHROOM,

04:13.122 --> 04:15.690
YOU'D ONLY HAVE A
ONE-STORY DROP TO THE
ROOF OF THE COMMON ROOM,

04:15.690 --> 04:17.039
AND THEN YOU COULD
CROSS BEHIND THE QUAD,

04:17.039 --> 04:19.171
WHICH HAS, LIKE,
NO LIGHTS TO SPEAK OF.

04:20.738 --> 04:21.739
OR NOT.

04:25.743 --> 04:28.093
DON'T I HAVE
A SAY IN THIS?

04:28.093 --> 04:30.357
SWEETHEART, IT'S PART
OF THE SETTLEMENT.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.750
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

04:32.750 --> 04:36.101
NEITHER YOUR FATHER OR I
CAN AFFORD TO BUY
EACH OTHER OUT,

04:36.101 --> 04:37.581
AND THE TRUTH IS,

04:37.581 --> 04:40.715
NEITHER ONE OF US NEEDS
A PLACE THIS BIG ANYWAY.

04:40.715 --> 04:43.065
HONEY, WE HAVE TO
BE PRACTICAL.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.415
RIGHT. PRACTICAL.

04:45.415 --> 04:50.072
ALL YOU NEED TO TELL US
IS WHAT YOU WANT US TO
DO WITH YOUR STUFF.

04:50.072 --> 04:54.598
DO YOU WANT YOUR FATHER
AND I TO DIVIDE IT
BETWEEN US,

04:54.598 --> 04:59.124
OR IF YOU LIKE,
I CAN MOVE IT ALL
EXACTLY AS IT IS HERE

04:59.124 --> 05:01.518
TO WHEREVER I GO.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.433
THAT'S NOT THE SAME.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.957
IT'S JUST
GLORIFIED STORAGE.

05:07.916 --> 05:12.094
SARAH, HONEY...

05:12.094 --> 05:15.315
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

05:17.534 --> 05:19.623
WELL...

05:19.623 --> 05:24.889
I WAS KIND OF GOING FOR
A SLEEK, CONTEMPORARY
VIBE IN HERE,

05:24.889 --> 05:28.197
BUT IF YOU WERE THINKING
MORE ALONG THE LINES OF
ROMPER ROOM...

05:28.197 --> 05:31.287
OH...I COULDN'T JUST
STICK IT IN THE GUEST ROOM

05:31.287 --> 05:33.681
IN MY MOM'S NEW APARTMENT
OR MY DAD'S NEW PLACE

05:33.681 --> 05:35.857
AND THEN PRETEND
I GREW UP THERE.

05:35.857 --> 05:39.774
IT'S LIKE, WHEREVER
THEY END UP, IT'S NOT
GONNA BE MY HOME, RIGHT?

05:39.774 --> 05:41.253
HEY...

05:41.253 --> 05:42.820
HEY, IT'S OK.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.822
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM
FOR EVERYTHING HERE.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.479
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:49.479 --> 05:54.136
I REALLY SEE THIS WORKING
IN THE BATHROOM.

05:54.136 --> 05:57.748
IT'S NEVER
GOING TO BE
LIKE IT WAS, IS IT?

06:01.230 --> 06:03.101
NO.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.452
IT'S LIKE DOMINOES.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.584
PARENTS SPLIT,

06:07.584 --> 06:08.933
APARTMENT GETS SOLD,

06:08.933 --> 06:10.413
FAMILY DISAPPEARS.

06:10.413 --> 06:13.460
CLICK, CLICK, CLICK.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.332
I JUST KEEP THINKING
ABOUT MY MOM.

06:16.332 --> 06:18.116
YEAH.

06:18.116 --> 06:19.944
IT'S GONNA BE
A BIG CHANGE FOR HER.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.859
HOW OLD WAS SHE WHEN
SHE MARRIED YOUR DAD?

06:21.859 --> 06:24.993
NO. MY MOM.
MY REAL MOM.
MY BIRTH MOTHER.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.473
ROBIN?

06:26.473 --> 06:28.213
YEAH.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.520
YEAH. YOU KNOW, WHEN I
MET HER A COUPLE YEARS AGO,

06:30.520 --> 06:33.001
SHE WAS
JUST THIS PERSON,

06:33.001 --> 06:36.047
THIS REALLY COOL PERSON
WHO WAS KIND OF LIVING
HER OWN LIFE

06:36.047 --> 06:38.789
AND WALKING AROUND
WITH THE SAME DNA AS ME.

06:38.789 --> 06:41.009
BUT I DIDN'T NEED HER
TO BE MORE THAN THAT,

06:41.009 --> 06:44.447
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I HAD A FAMILY.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.492
BUT NOW...

06:49.800 --> 06:53.021
COME ON, NOW. EVERYONE'S
GOT TO SHARE HERE.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.588

06:54.588 --> 06:58.069
THE THING
I DIDN'T EXPECT, HUH?

06:58.069 --> 07:00.071
OK. HONESTLY,
I DIDN'T EXPECT

07:00.071 --> 07:03.248
TO FIND CHERYL SO SEXY
IN HER THIRD TRIMESTER.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.989
WELL, IT'S TRUE.

07:04.989 --> 07:07.514
WE ARE KINDA HAVING SEX
ALL THE TIME.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.516
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.736
I SEE JILL AND HENRY
NODDING BACK THERE.

07:12.736 --> 07:13.824

[SOBBING]

07:15.260 --> 07:18.089

LOVE THE BABY SO MUCH.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.178
I MEAN, HE'S
NOT EVEN HERE YET,

07:20.178 --> 07:23.051
BUT I CAN'T EVEN
EXPLAIN IT IN WORDS.

07:23.051 --> 07:26.228
I JUST LOVE HIM
SO MUCH.

07:26.228 --> 07:28.883
IT'S OVERWHELMING,
ISN'T IT?

07:28.883 --> 07:33.670
LADIES, DON'T LET
ANYONE TELL YOU THAT'S
JUST HORMONES TALKING.

07:33.670 --> 07:39.415
THERE'S A VERY REAL
BOND DEVELOPING BETWEEN
YOU AND YOUR CHILD.

07:39.415 --> 07:42.679
HE FEELS YOUR LAUGHTER,
HE KNOWS YOUR
MOVEMENTS...

07:42.679 --> 07:44.855
OK, WHO DOES THAT LEAVE?

07:44.855 --> 07:48.380
LET'S--DAPHNE, CHARLIE,
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

07:48.380 --> 07:49.730
HAS BEEN
THE BIGGEST SURPRISE?

07:52.515 --> 07:54.474
UH...
UH...

07:54.474 --> 07:56.693
WELL, I--LET'S SEE.
UM...

07:56.693 --> 07:59.914
I GUESS
I'D HAVE TO SAY...

07:59.914 --> 08:01.089

08:03.395 --> 08:06.268
YEAH. YEAH,
I'D HAVE TO GO
WITH THE GAS.

08:09.097 --> 08:12.013
TELL YOU WHAT--
NEXT TIME I PICK THE MOVIE,
YOU PICK THE RESTAURANT.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.580
WHAT, YOU DIDN'T
LIKE THE MOVIE?

08:13.580 --> 08:15.016
NO. I LOVED IT.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.757
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME I HAD SO MUCH FUN

08:16.757 --> 08:18.454

GET BLUDGEONED.

08:18.454 --> 08:21.152

PASTA WITH RED SAUCE

AFTER SEEING
ALL THOSE BLOOD
AND GUTS, YOU WIMP.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.287

ONE OF US HAD
A HUMAN REACTION.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.071
I MEAN, YOU
DIDN'T EVEN FLINCH.

08:27.071 --> 08:29.900

IT'S JUST KETCHUP

08:29.900 --> 08:31.162

HER INTESTINES

08:35.166 --> 08:36.385
HATE TO BREAK IT
TO YOU, PAL.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.169
NOT EVEN THE KISS
IN THE CEMETERY.

08:38.169 --> 08:39.519
NOW, THAT WAS REAL.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.216
YOU CAN'T FAKE
A KISS LIKE THAT.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.305

THE CAMERA THAT CLOSE.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.307

10:20.097 --> 10:23.797
YEAH. I'M IN
REALLY BAD SHAPE.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.276
I-I'VE GOT, UM...

10:25.276 --> 10:26.800
SHE'S GOT A...

10:26.800 --> 10:28.149
A NOSEBLEED.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.586
OH, I THINK
IT'S STARTING AGAIN.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.109
IT'S REALLY BAD.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.545
I ALMOST FAINTED.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.243
SHE ALMOST FAINTED.

10:35.243 --> 10:37.680
WE WERE JUST ABOUT TO TAKE HER
TO THE INFIRMARY.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.944
WEARING ALL THAT
EYE MAKEUP?

10:40.944 --> 10:45.253
WE HEARD DAVID CALVERT
CAME DOWN WITH MONO.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.689
OH...JUST GO.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.957
HEE HEE...

10:58.788 --> 11:02.662
SO HOW ARE CHILDBIRTH
CLASSES GOING?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.620
FINE.
THEY'RE GOING FINE.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.144
AND YOU FOLKS ARE
BEGINNING TO GIVE
SOME THOUGHT

11:07.144 --> 11:08.668
TO A BIRTHING PLAN,
RIGHT?

11:08.668 --> 11:11.148
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
I WANT DRUGS.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.629
I WANT LOTS AND
LOTS OF DRUGS.

11:13.629 --> 11:16.545
UNLESS--THAT'S OK, RIGHT?

11:16.545 --> 11:19.156
I MEAN, CAN THEY HAVE
ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS
ON THE BABY?

11:19.156 --> 11:21.463
OH, YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO HAVE AN EPIDURAL?

11:21.463 --> 11:23.552
FINE.
THEN YOU HAVE THE BABY.

11:23.552 --> 11:24.771
UH-HUH...

11:24.771 --> 11:26.903
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.384
WANT TO KNOW WHAT
COLOR TO PAINT
THE NURSERY?

11:29.384 --> 11:31.473
YOU MEAN...

11:31.473 --> 11:33.170
I'VE GOT A CLEAR
SHOT UP THE MIDDLE.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.477
WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE HAVING?

11:35.477 --> 11:37.087
YES.
NO.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.045
YES.
NO.

11:39.524 --> 11:40.482
YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW?

11:40.482 --> 11:41.918
NO!

11:41.918 --> 11:43.485
I MEAN,
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE NOT GONNA

11:43.485 --> 11:44.834
FIND OUT
EVENTUALLY
ANYWAY.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.488
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO KNOW RIGHT NOW.

11:46.488 --> 11:48.664
WHAT DO YOU DO
IF ONE OF US
WANTS TO KNOW

11:48.664 --> 11:50.144
AND THE OTHER ONE
DOESN'T?

11:50.144 --> 11:53.190
DAPHNE, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO GET DRESSED

11:53.190 --> 11:56.367
WHILE CHARLIE AND I
STEP OUTSIDE
FOR A SECOND?

11:59.327 --> 12:00.589
WHATEVER.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.825
I DON'T
WANT TO KNOW, OK?

12:18.825 --> 12:20.391
I MEAN IT.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.481
NOTHING.

12:23.481 --> 12:26.397
NOTHING. HE SAID HE MOVED
INTO THE APARTMENT
2 MONTHS AGO,

12:26.397 --> 12:28.225
AND HE KNOWS NOTHING
OF A PREVIOUS TENANT.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.097
WHAT ABOUT
THE LANDLORD?

12:30.097 --> 12:32.055
SOME NEW
MANAGEMENT COMPANY.
THEY DON'T KNOW HER.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.491
THERE WAS NO
FORWARDING ADDRESS,

12:33.491 --> 12:35.493
NO RECORDED MESSAGE
ON HER OLD NUMBER.

12:35.493 --> 12:36.886
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO LOOK.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.540
IT SEEMS
KIND OF WEIRD.

12:38.540 --> 12:41.238
I MEAN,
I DON'T MEAN TO--

12:41.238 --> 12:42.892
WEREN'T YOU GUYS
CLOSE?

12:44.111 --> 12:46.374
SORT OF.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.376
NOT REALLY,
BUT I MEAN,
MEETING HER

12:48.376 --> 12:49.943
FOR THE FIRST TIME
WAS A BIG DEAL.

12:49.943 --> 12:52.249
IT WAS LIKE, HEY,

12:52.249 --> 12:54.512
THIS IS THE WOMAN THAT
I'VE BEEN DREAMING OF
ALL THESE YEARS, YOU KNOW,

12:54.512 --> 12:56.819
AND SHE'S COOL.
SHE'S AN ACTRESS.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.908
PRETTY MUCH
LOOKS LIKE ME...

12:58.908 --> 13:01.693
I MEAN, WE WROTE A LOT,
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WE
SHARED ALL THAT MUCH,

13:01.693 --> 13:03.565
SO AFTER A WHILE,
IT WAS JUST SORT OF,

13:03.565 --> 13:05.959
"HEY, GUESS WHAT
I DID THIS MONTH?
I STARTED COLLEGE."

13:05.959 --> 13:07.612
OR YOU KNOW,
"GUESS WHAT I DID?

13:07.612 --> 13:09.614
I'M GONNA BE
IN A NEW PLAY."

13:09.614 --> 13:12.748
I GOT BUSY,
SHE WAS ON TOUR...

13:15.011 --> 13:16.839
I KNOW IT'S STUPID.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.581
I PRETTY MUCH TAKE
EVERYTHING
FOR GRANTED, DON'T I?

13:19.581 --> 13:21.235
SARAH...

13:21.235 --> 13:24.847
NO. JUST SAY IT.
I DESERVE IT. SAY IT.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.939
WHY DON'T YOU
CONTACT HER
THEATER COMPANY?

13:29.939 --> 13:31.593
MAYBE THEY KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.424
YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.252
NO...I KNOW.
I KNOW.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.080
IT'S JUST,
THEY'RE FORWARDING
ALL MY MAIL TO SCHOOL,

13:40.080 --> 13:41.951
AND SOME OF IT'S YOURS,
SO I THOUGHT

13:41.951 --> 13:45.825
IF I FORWARD IT AGAIN,
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT NEVER
GET HERE.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.565
ANYWAYS, WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE BOXES?

13:47.565 --> 13:48.740
YOU MOVING OUT
OR SOMETHING?

13:48.740 --> 13:50.612
OH, I WAS GONNA--

13:50.612 --> 13:53.441
I'M NOT REALLY
GETTING THAT MANY
HOURS AT THE SHOP,

13:53.441 --> 13:55.660
AND THE RENT'S
KIND OF TOUGH...

13:55.660 --> 13:59.273
ANYWAY, CHARLIE
SAID THAT--

13:59.273 --> 14:02.493
THIS IS ONLY IF
YOU'RE OK WITH THIS.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.106
BUT HE SAID
THAT IT'D BE OK

14:06.106 --> 14:07.803
IF I SORT OF CRASHED
IN THE SHED FOR
A LITTLE WHILE

14:07.803 --> 14:10.066
UNTIL THINGS
EASE UP.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.067
SURE.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.721
SURE. WHY NOT?

14:12.721 --> 14:14.854
HEY, THAT WAY
I CAN SEE HIM,
I CAN SEE YOU,

14:14.854 --> 14:16.943
AND TAKE ONE TRIP,
RIGHT?

14:16.943 --> 14:18.161
RIGHT.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.207
WELL,
SO HOW'S SCHOOL?

14:20.207 --> 14:22.339
HOW'S THAT GREAT
WRITING PROFESSOR?

14:22.339 --> 14:24.515
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.169
HE THINKS
I'M TALENTED.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.562
WELL, DUH.

14:29.825 --> 14:30.957
SO YOU SEEING
ANYONE?

14:33.611 --> 14:36.527
OH...

14:36.527 --> 14:38.486
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S HARD.

14:38.486 --> 14:41.184
I GUESS I HAVE REALLY
HIGH STANDARDS.

14:43.143 --> 14:45.841
NOT THAT THERE'S
ANY RUSH OR ANYTHING.

14:45.841 --> 14:48.757
I MEAN, IF IT
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT,
WHAT'S THE POINT?

14:48.757 --> 14:49.889
RIGHT? IT'S NOT LIKE
I HAVE TO HAVE

14:49.889 --> 14:53.022
A BOYFRIEND
AT ALL TIMES.

14:53.022 --> 14:55.372
DON'T YOU FIND IT
REALLY HARD?

14:55.372 --> 14:59.072
UH...

14:59.072 --> 15:01.944
I'M, UH, I'M SEEING
SOMEBODY, ACTUALLY.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.078
OH.

15:05.078 --> 15:08.864
JUST SOMEBODY
AT THE SHOP
SET US UP, SO...

15:10.474 --> 15:12.781
OH...UH-HUH.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.478
WELL, THAT'S...

15:14.478 --> 15:16.132
WOW. THAT'S NICE, EH?

15:16.132 --> 15:17.786
YOU HAVING FUN?
YOU LIKE HER?

15:17.786 --> 15:19.135
SHE'S OK.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.529
I'M JUST GETTING
USED TO IT.

15:21.529 --> 15:22.530
RIGHT.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.361
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

15:29.319 --> 15:30.712
'CAUSE
IT GETS EASIER.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.632
PAUL, TAKE THE SPOT
UP TO THE BALCONY

15:37.632 --> 15:41.331
THEN MOUNT THE CLOUD GO-BOS
AND THE BIG LIKOS...

15:41.331 --> 15:44.334
HIS ASSISTANT SAID
THAT HE'D BE BREAKING
IN A FEW MINUTES.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.379
QUIT THINKING ABOUT
YOUR GOLF GAME

15:45.379 --> 15:46.902
AND LOWER THAT THIRD...

15:46.902 --> 15:48.904
DID YOU SEE THE PICTURE OF
HER IN THE LOBBY,

15:48.904 --> 15:50.645
THE ONE FROM
FOOL FOR LOVE

15:50.645 --> 15:52.168
BACK WHEN SHE HAD
LONG HAIR?

15:52.168 --> 15:53.822
YOU COULD DEFINITELY
SEE A RESEMBLANCE.

15:53.822 --> 15:56.129
WHO WAS IT WHO WANTED
A WORD WITH ME?

15:56.129 --> 15:58.522
OH, UM...HI.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.614
UM, MY NAME'S
SARAH REEVES.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.573
HOW DO YOU DO?

16:05.573 --> 16:08.054
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF I COULD HAVE
A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME.

16:08.054 --> 16:12.406
I'M LOOKING FOR A WOMAN
BY THE NAME OF
ROBIN MERRIN...

16:34.863 --> 16:37.648
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

16:41.261 --> 16:43.306
OH, MY GOD.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.655
I KNOW.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.570
OH, MY GOD.
REALLY? FOR SURE?

16:46.570 --> 16:49.834
WELL, IT'S
95% FOR SURE, SO...

16:51.227 --> 16:53.316
AAH!

16:53.316 --> 16:56.928
OH, THAT'S SO--
JUST, OH...

16:56.928 --> 16:59.235
THAT IS SO...
I MEAN,

16:59.235 --> 17:00.410
CHARLIE,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE--

17:00.410 --> 17:02.108
SHH.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.413
SHH?

17:03.413 --> 17:05.024
DAPHNE.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.242
DAPHNE...

17:06.242 --> 17:07.591
SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.463
WHAT? HOW COULD
SHE NOT KNOW?

17:09.463 --> 17:11.247
I MEAN,
WASN'T SHE THERE?

17:11.247 --> 17:12.553
SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO KNOW.

17:12.553 --> 17:13.858
OH.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.339
OH! SO SHE WANTS
TO BE SURPRISED.

17:16.339 --> 17:17.688
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:17.688 --> 17:19.473
MY SISTER
WAS EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.

17:19.473 --> 17:20.778
SHE WANTED TO WAIT
FOR THAT DRUMROLL
MOMENT

17:20.778 --> 17:22.302
IN THE DELIVERY
ROOM,

17:22.302 --> 17:24.173
WHICH DROVE
MY MOM CRAZY,
OF COURSE.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.958
KIRSTEN, IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT FOR DAPHNE.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.483
TRUST ME, IF DAPHNE
KNOWS WHAT SHE'S HAVING,

17:29.483 --> 17:33.530
IT'S HARDER TO ACT LIKE
IT'S JUST A BASKETBALL
SHE'S BEEN CARRYING AROUND.

17:33.530 --> 17:36.838
'CAUSE...I MEAN,
WHEN YOU KNOW,

17:36.838 --> 17:38.231
IT'S WEIRD.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.885
YOU CONNECT
IN A WHOLE NEW WAY.

17:40.885 --> 17:44.063
I MEAN, SUDDENLY THE BABY
ISN'T THIS ABSTRACT THING.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.803
IT'S A LITTLE PERSON...

17:45.803 --> 17:49.285
WITH A--A SEX
AND A FACE AND A...

17:49.285 --> 17:50.982
A LIFE.

17:50.982 --> 17:54.943
IT'S LITTLE LEAGUE GAMES
AND EASY-BAKE OVENS AND...

17:54.943 --> 17:56.292
IT'S REAL...

17:56.292 --> 17:58.077
AND IT'S HAPPENING...

17:58.077 --> 18:01.167
AND IT'S HAPPENING
TO HER.

18:01.167 --> 18:04.126
AS LONG AS SHE CAN
PRETEND LIKE IT ISN'T,

18:04.126 --> 18:05.562
IT'S FINE WITH HER.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.136
SHE WAS DOING A PLAY

18:14.136 --> 18:18.445
THAT A FRIEND OF HERS
WROTE FOR A SUMMER
FESTIVAL OR SOMETHING.

18:18.445 --> 18:22.144
I THINK THE GUY SAID
IT WAS IN WYOMING.

18:22.144 --> 18:25.191
SHE TOOK A LITTLE PLANE...

18:25.191 --> 18:27.802
AND THERE WAS A STORM...

18:27.802 --> 18:31.501
ANYWAY, UM, I GUESS
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A WILL,
YOU KNOW,

18:31.501 --> 18:34.113
OR THEY WOULD HAVE
CALLED ME...

18:34.113 --> 18:37.420
UNLESS I WASN'T
IN THE WILL.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.901
HEY.

18:39.901 --> 18:44.210
LOOK...AT LEAST
YOU GOT TO MEET HER.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.689
RIGHT? I MEAN,

18:45.689 --> 18:47.300
IF YOU HAD WAITED
JUST A FEW YEARS LONGER,

18:47.300 --> 18:48.388
THEN YOU WOULDN'T--

18:50.520 --> 18:54.524
AT LEAST YOU GOT
THE CHANCE.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.091
YEAH. I KNOW THAT.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.226
I KNOW THAT.
I DON'T--

19:00.226 --> 19:03.142
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I'M CRYING,
YOU KNOW?

19:03.142 --> 19:06.449
IT'S NOT LIKE I EVEN
KNEW HER THAT WELL.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.321
BUT SHE WAS MY MOTHER.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.804
THAT'S SO WEIRD.
SHE WAS MY MOTHER.

19:15.806 --> 19:19.941
AND I FEEL REALLY SAD
FOR HER THAT SHE DIED.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.857
AND I FEEL SAD FOR ME
BECAUSE I FEEL ALONE,

19:22.857 --> 19:25.686
AND I AM SO ANGRY
AT MYSELF

19:25.686 --> 19:28.079
FOR NEVER KNOWING
WHAT I HAVE.

19:28.079 --> 19:30.865
YEAH. WELL...

19:30.865 --> 19:33.128
NOBODY EVER DOES.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.916
IT'S LIKE SHE HAD ME,
AND SHE LET ME GO.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.573
AND THEN I HAD HER,
AND I LET HER GO.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.587
TROUBLE.
YOU GOTTA MOVE BACK.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.720
I AM NOW VERY LATE
FOR SCHOOL.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.243
NUH-UH. YOU CHEATED.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.679
NO, I DID NOT.

20:02.679 --> 20:04.551
KIRSTEN, SORRY ABOUT THIS.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.857
I'M REALLY--I'M NOT
FEELING VERY WELL.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.076
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.425
MOVE IT BACK.

20:09.425 --> 20:10.861
IF HE HAD SCHOOL,
WE'D BE FINE,

20:10.861 --> 20:12.689
BUT THEY HAVE THESE
TEACHER CONFERENCES.

20:12.689 --> 20:13.777
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.257
MAYBE YOU ATE
SOMETHING.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.650
I DON'T THINK SO.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.129
I'M HAVING LOTS OF
LITTLE CONTRACTIONS.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.740
BRAXTON-HICKS
OR SOMETHING.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.045
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SEE THE DOCTOR.

20:21.045 --> 20:22.264
DON'T MOVE THAT ONE.
MOVE THAT ONE.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.396
I DON'T NEED
TO SEE THE DOCTOR.

20:23.396 --> 20:24.745
I'M PREGNANT.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.486
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO FEEL WELL.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.052
I DON'T WANT TO
MOVE THAT ONE.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.315
Both: DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT.

20:29.315 --> 20:32.100
I JUST NEED TO RELAX.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.362
OK...

20:33.362 --> 20:35.277
I'LL BE HOME BY 3:30.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.497
IT'S AMAZING WHAT
MOMS GO THROUGH,
HUH?

20:37.497 --> 20:38.889
HEH. NO KIDDING.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.326
WELL, I GUESS
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

20:40.326 --> 20:42.066
ONE DAY SHE'LL TAKE
CARE OF BOTH OF YOU.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.111
WHAT?

20:44.417 --> 20:47.115
SHE'LL
TAKE CARE OF--

20:47.115 --> 20:48.029
TROUBLE!

20:49.596 --> 20:51.424
KIRSTEN, LOOK.
TROUBLE.

20:51.424 --> 20:52.555
OH...

20:52.555 --> 20:54.296
OH, GOD...

20:54.296 --> 20:57.430
THE GUY AT THE THEATER
GAVE ME THEIR ADDRESS.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.127
I'M GONNA GO SEE 'EM.

21:00.824 --> 21:01.869
UH-HUH.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.481
WHY?

21:05.481 --> 21:07.440
WHY ARE YOU
GONNA DO THAT?

21:07.440 --> 21:09.006
WHAT AN IDIOTIC
QUESTION.

21:09.006 --> 21:10.921
THEY'RE MY
GRANDPARENTS,
YOU KNOW?

21:10.921 --> 21:14.098
THEY KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT MY MOM AND
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

21:14.098 --> 21:18.059
THEY MAY EVEN
KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT MY FATHER.

21:18.059 --> 21:18.973
SARAH...

21:21.105 --> 21:23.282
YOUR MOM WOULDN'T
EVEN TELL YOU
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.893
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SHE'D TELL THEM?

21:27.547 --> 21:29.244
I THINK YOU SHOULD
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

21:29.244 --> 21:30.463
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

21:30.463 --> 21:32.639
NO. NO, I'M NOT.

21:32.639 --> 21:35.729
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO MAKE ME FEEL
STUPID FOR WANTING THIS?

21:35.729 --> 21:39.210
SARAH, YOU
DON'T WANT TO JUST
MEET THESE PEOPLE.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.909
YOU WANT THEM...
TO LOVE YOU.

21:41.909 --> 21:46.130
YOU WANT THEM
TO OPEN THEIR ARMS
TO YOU AND--AND...

21:46.130 --> 21:48.219
I DON'T KNOW,
TELL YOU THAT YOU
BELONG OR SOMETHING,

21:48.219 --> 21:50.396
BUT THEY NEVER
LOOKED FOR YOU,

21:50.396 --> 21:51.962
AND THEY'RE NOT
LOOKING FOR YOU NOW,

21:51.962 --> 21:54.313
EVEN AFTER
THEIR DAUGHTER DIED.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.577
RIGHT?

21:59.535 --> 22:01.581
I WOULD NEVER
DO THIS TO YOU.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.104
NEVER.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.149
WHEN YOU WERE DEALING
WITH YOUR GRANDFATHER,

22:05.149 --> 22:07.021
GOD, BAILEY,
I WAS ALWAYS--

22:08.892 --> 22:11.895
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
YOU HAVE NOBODY,

22:11.895 --> 22:14.071
AND I HAVE
THE POSSIBILITY
OF SOMEBODY.

22:14.071 --> 22:15.072
SARAH--

22:15.072 --> 22:16.073
NO. THAT'S FINE.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.510
IT'S FINE.

22:17.510 --> 22:18.815
FROM NOW ON, I WILL DO IT
WITHOUT YOU.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.513
YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF
REALLY CLEAR.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.310
HEY. ONE SEC.

22:35.310 --> 22:39.401
OH, ELINOR JUST FOUND OUT
THAT EDWARD IS GOING TO
MARRY LUCY.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.231
SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.

22:43.231 --> 22:44.885
OH. I THOUGHT WE WERE
JUST GOING TO WATCH

22:44.885 --> 22:46.930
THE EMMA THOMPSON MOVIE
BEFORE THE TEST.

22:46.930 --> 22:49.411
YEAH, BUT IT TURNS OUT
THE BOOK IS--IS PRETTY GOOD.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.065
YEAH, YEAH.
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

22:51.065 --> 22:53.502
HALLIE HEARD THERE'S
THIS LEO LOOK-ALIKE
CONTEST

22:53.502 --> 22:55.069
AT THE GALLERIA
IN TOWN.

22:55.069 --> 22:56.418
IS THAT LIKE
THE TACKIEST THING

22:56.418 --> 22:57.593
YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF
OR WHAT?

22:57.593 --> 22:58.986
TOTALLY.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.075
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D
GO LAUGH OUR ASSES OFF,

23:01.075 --> 23:04.818
GET SOMETHING TO EAT,
MAYBE CATCH A FLICK.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.776
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T THINK SO.

23:06.776 --> 23:07.908
WHY NOT?

23:07.908 --> 23:08.996
I MEAN,
YEAH, IT'S GOOFY,

23:08.996 --> 23:10.389
BUT IT'LL BE
A BLAST.

23:12.869 --> 23:15.219
I JUST KINDA
WANT TO FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

23:15.219 --> 23:17.221
LOOK, HALLIE ALREADY
RENTED THE MOVIE.

23:17.221 --> 23:20.224
YOU CAN JUST
FAST-FORWARD
THROUGH IT.

23:20.224 --> 23:22.096
THAT'S THE THING,
PARKER...

23:24.664 --> 23:27.971
I DON'T WANT TO
FAST-FORWARD THROUGH IT.

23:27.971 --> 23:29.059
FINE.

23:29.059 --> 23:30.844
WHATEVER.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.201
ROBIN?

23:40.201 --> 23:42.029
NO.
ROBIN ISN'T HERE.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.161
NO. I KNOW.

23:44.161 --> 23:45.859
IF YOU'RE FROM ONE OF
THOSE ORGANIZATIONS
SHE WAS PART OF--

23:45.859 --> 23:46.860
MR. MERRIN,

23:46.860 --> 23:48.818
I KNOW
THAT ROBIN DIED.

23:48.818 --> 23:51.038
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

23:51.038 --> 23:53.170
I'M HER DAUGHTER.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.783
NO, NO, NO.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.741
SHE GAVE HER BABY UP.
SHE WALKED AWAY.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.482
YEAH, WELL,

24:00.482 --> 24:02.919
WE KIND OF FOUND EACH OTHER, SHE
AND I, ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO.

24:02.919 --> 24:03.920
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.400
MR. MERRIN,

24:05.400 --> 24:09.752
HOW ELSE WOULD I KNOW THAT SHE
HAD A CHILD?

24:09.752 --> 24:12.712
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS, UH,
THIS IS, UH...

24:12.712 --> 24:14.583
I DON'T WANT
ANY PART OF THIS.

24:14.583 --> 24:16.585
I DIDN'T APPROVE
OF ANY OF IT,

24:16.585 --> 24:19.632
AND I, UH...
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

24:19.632 --> 24:21.938
NO. CAN YOU JUST
GIVE ME A CHANCE?

24:21.938 --> 24:23.549
PLEASE?

24:23.549 --> 24:26.508
DIDN'T SHE TELL YOU ABOUT
ME? THINK ABOUT IT.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.293
MY NAME'S SARAH.
SARAH REEVES.

24:29.293 --> 24:30.904
NO. I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

24:30.904 --> 24:32.819
REALLY?

24:32.819 --> 24:34.995
SHE DIDN'T EVER
TALK TO YOU ABOUT
FINDING HER DAUGHTER?

24:34.995 --> 24:36.649
WE DIDN'T TALK, PERIOD.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.302
OK, THEN YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE YOUR WIFE.

24:38.302 --> 24:40.000
NO. SHE'S BEEN DEAD
FOR 3 YEARS.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.175
PLEASE,
LEAVE ME ALONE.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.046
MR. MERRIN, I AM
YOUR GRANDCHILD.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.750
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.447
WHO ARE YOU?

24:52.447 --> 24:56.407
I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR
STORY IS TRUE OR NOT, BUT--

24:56.407 --> 24:59.715
I'M 73 YEARS OLD.

24:59.715 --> 25:02.239
I--I DON'T WANT
ANY OF THIS.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.112
COULD YOU JUST
AT LEAST TALK
TO ME ABOUT HER,

25:05.112 --> 25:06.505
YOU KNOW,
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER,

25:06.505 --> 25:08.550
WHAT IT WAS LIKE
WHEN SHE HAD ME?

25:08.550 --> 25:10.334
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO MY FATHER IS.

25:10.334 --> 25:12.511
YEAH, WELL...

25:12.511 --> 25:14.121
I CAN'T. NO.

25:14.121 --> 25:16.079
THAT'S IT?

25:16.079 --> 25:19.039
THAT'S IT? COME ON.
YOU CAN'T JUST...

25:22.216 --> 25:23.217
I'M SORRY.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.438
I'M SORRY.

25:27.438 --> 25:30.137
IT'S JUST, YOU ARE
THE ONLY PERSON...

25:32.748 --> 25:33.793
COULD YOU...

25:36.143 --> 25:40.016
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
OF MY MOM'S.

25:40.016 --> 25:43.280
CAN YOU JUST
GIVE ME SOMETHING
OF HERS TO KEEP?

25:45.065 --> 25:47.546
IT COULD BE
SOMETHING VERY SMALL.

25:50.418 --> 25:52.202
I KINDA LIKE IT,
ACTUALLY.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.509
I GOT 'EM MAKING
CURIO SHELVES
THIS WEEK.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.119
ALTHOUGH, GOD KNOWS

25:56.119 --> 25:59.340
WHAT A BUNCH OF 10th
GRADERS NEED WITH CURIO SHELVES.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.211
A PLACE TO STORE
THEIR POT.

26:01.211 --> 26:03.300
HEH HEH...
EXACTLY.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.781
I PLAN ON SHAKING UP
THE LESSON PLAN.

26:05.781 --> 26:08.610
NEXT WEEK,
WE'RE GONNA BUILD
A CONDOMINIUM.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.351
KINDA DEJA VU, HUH?

26:10.351 --> 26:13.659
YOU PACKING UP
YOUR THINGS TO
MAKE ROOM IN HERE.

26:13.659 --> 26:16.487
WELL, DEJA VU
MINUS JULIA,
I GUESS.

26:16.487 --> 26:19.142
YEAH. LISTEN, UM...
ABOUT THAT--JULIA--

26:19.142 --> 26:22.145
YOU KNOW, SHE SAID
SHE WAS OK WITH THIS.

26:22.145 --> 26:24.321
I KNOW. I WAS
JUST THINKING

26:24.321 --> 26:27.673
IT MIGHT BE
A LITTLE WEIRD IF
SHE RAN INTO YOU

26:27.673 --> 26:29.805
WHEN YOU HAD,
YOU KNOW, COMPANY.

26:29.805 --> 26:32.068
UH...IT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN, CHARLIE.

26:32.068 --> 26:35.071
WELL, IT COULD,
AND I JUST WANNA
MAKE EVERYTHING

26:35.071 --> 26:37.030
AS EASY AS POSSIBLE
ON JULIA,

26:37.030 --> 26:39.728
SO MAYBE IF YOU AND I
HAD AN UNDERSTANDING
UP FRONT...

26:39.728 --> 26:41.774
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
GIRLS OVER HERE,
OK, CHARLIE?

26:41.774 --> 26:44.646
OK. THAT'S ALL
I'M ASKING.

26:47.388 --> 26:51.348
I CAN'T EVEN THINK
OF ANY OTHER GIRLS
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW?

26:51.348 --> 26:54.830
IT'S, LIKE, EVEN
BUYING A CUP OF
COFFEE FOR A GIRL

26:54.830 --> 26:59.530
IS, LIKE...SO FAR
DOWN THE LINE.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.968
UH, LOOK,
ALL I'M SAYING IS

27:01.968 --> 27:04.710
THERE'S NO DANGER
OF THAT HAPPENING,
ALL RIGHT?

27:04.710 --> 27:05.928
NONE AT ALL.

27:10.367 --> 27:11.586
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

27:11.586 --> 27:13.370
REALLY.

27:13.370 --> 27:16.199
I DON'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
SOMEONE BOUGHT ME FLOWERS.

27:16.199 --> 27:18.375
IN FACT, I DON'T THINK
ANYONE EVER HAS,

27:18.375 --> 27:20.203
WHICH IS WEIRD, HUH?

27:20.203 --> 27:22.989
I MEAN, 18, NO LIMP,
NO DISFIGURING SCARS,
NO HUMP.

27:22.989 --> 27:25.644
YOU'D THINK ONCE,
AT LEAST, SOMEONE WOULD
STOP AT A FLOWER STAND.

27:25.644 --> 27:29.125
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY
DON'T HAVE ONE ON
EVERY FREAKING CORNER.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.171
I DON'T HAVE
A VASE, OK?

27:46.099 --> 27:47.535
HEY.

27:47.535 --> 27:48.536
HEY.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.890
MMM...

27:54.890 --> 27:55.891
OK...

27:55.891 --> 27:57.066
WHAT IS MY PROBLEM?

27:57.066 --> 27:58.546
I'M SORRY, JOSH.
I'M SORRY.

27:58.546 --> 27:59.590
IT'S JUST, UH--

27:59.590 --> 28:01.288
ME. IT'S
OBVIOUSLY ME.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.899
IT'S SOMETHING
I'M DOING, OR--
OR NOT DOING,

28:03.899 --> 28:07.686
OR IT'S MY OVERBITE,
OR MY DEODORANT.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.557
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S OK.

28:09.557 --> 28:12.603
I MEAN, SOMETIMES,
THESE THINGS ARE
JUST CHEMICAL.

28:12.603 --> 28:15.606
JOSH, IT IS SO NOT YOU.

28:15.606 --> 28:17.521
IT'S NOT?

28:19.175 --> 28:20.437
IT'S HIM.

28:20.437 --> 28:22.744
HIM. HIM?

28:22.744 --> 28:24.877
HE MET SOMEONE ELSE.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.269
WELL, IT--

28:26.269 --> 28:28.532
I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN
TOGETHER ALL THIS TIME,

28:28.532 --> 28:30.491
AND HE JUST MOVED ON.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.841
IT'S LIKE, IN LIGHT
OF EVERYTHING, IN LIGHT OF OUR
HISTORY,

28:32.841 --> 28:34.974
I SHOULD'VE BEEN ALLOWED
TO MOVE ON FIRST.

28:34.974 --> 28:37.498
DOESN'T THAT MAKE SENSE,
AS, LIKE, A PROFESSIONAL
COURTESY?

28:37.498 --> 28:40.153
YEAH, BUT...
WHY ARE YOU UPSET
ABOUT THIS NOW?

28:40.153 --> 28:42.633
I MEAN, YOU'VE KNOWN
FOR A WHILE.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.505
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

28:44.505 --> 28:49.075
JULIA, I TOLD YOU,
HE'S SLEEPING WITH
YOUR ROOMMATE.

28:49.075 --> 28:49.945
OH.

28:52.165 --> 28:53.035
OH.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.779
LISTEN, HE ISN'T SLEEPING
WITH MY ROOMMATE.

28:57.779 --> 29:01.957
I MEAN, HE IS--
NED IS--BUT HE
ISN'T NED.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.873
I MEAN, NED ISN'T HIM.
I MADE ALL THAT UP.

29:04.873 --> 29:06.570
GOD, I'M A MESS.

29:06.570 --> 29:10.487
JOSH, I'M A TOTAL MESS,
AND I'M A LIAR,
AND IF YOU KNEW,

29:10.487 --> 29:12.446
YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO KISS ME.

29:12.446 --> 29:15.754
YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO BE INVOLVED WITH ME.
TRUST ME ON THIS.

29:18.278 --> 29:21.237
YOU'RE NOT A MAN,
ARE YOU?

29:21.237 --> 29:23.239
WHAT?

29:23.239 --> 29:27.200
IT'S JUST I'M
SENSING A REVELATION COMING DOWN
THE PIKE HERE,

29:27.200 --> 29:31.204
AND I KINDA WANNA
CUT TO THE CHASE.

29:31.204 --> 29:33.554
I AM NOT A MAN.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.037
SIT DOWN. IT'S WORSE.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.910
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

29:41.910 --> 29:44.608
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO SAY ANYTHING.
THAT WAS THE POINT.

29:44.608 --> 29:47.437
IF I WANTED TO KNOW,
I WOULD'VE FOUND OUT
IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

29:47.437 --> 29:49.918
I CERTAINLY DIDN'T NEED
YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND
BLABBING IT.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.877
KIRSTEN FEELS AWFUL.
SHE FEELS TERRIBLE.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.487
YOU--YOU GOTTA
RINSE THOSE.

29:56.098 --> 29:58.797
YOU JUST HAD TO
GO AND TELL HER,
DIDN'T YOU?

29:58.797 --> 30:01.582
YEAH, I DID.
I HAD TO TELL SOMEONE.

30:01.582 --> 30:04.454
I'M HAVING A LITTLE GIRL,
AND I WANTED TO TELL SOMEONE

30:04.454 --> 30:06.500
WHO WAS GONNA RESPOND
LIKE IT WAS GOOD NEWS.

30:10.243 --> 30:14.247
LOOK, I KNOW YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW,

30:14.247 --> 30:18.164
BUT NOW YOU DO,
SO LET'S DEAL WITH IT.

30:18.164 --> 30:21.123
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT HER.

30:24.300 --> 30:29.262
I WAS THINKING...
MAYBE WE COULD
NAME HER DIANA.

30:29.262 --> 30:31.046
AS IN PRINCESS?

30:31.046 --> 30:33.353
AS IN MY MOTHER.

30:35.398 --> 30:38.880
OH...WOW.

30:41.404 --> 30:44.755
WELL, THAT'S GONNA
KINDA BE A PROBLEM
FOR ME, CHARLIE,

30:44.755 --> 30:46.845
BECAUSE MY NEXT DOOR
NEIGHBOR GROWING UP,

30:46.845 --> 30:48.847
HER NAME WAS DIANA--
DIANA de DARIO--

30:48.847 --> 30:50.849
AND WE'D CALL HER
"THE ITALIAN SUB."

30:50.849 --> 30:53.155
AND EVERY TIME I
HEAR THE NAME DIANA,

30:53.155 --> 30:56.463
I THINK OF THIS
EXTREMELY FAT GIRL
WHO SHAVED MY DOG

30:56.463 --> 30:58.682
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T
GIVE HER MY TWINKIE.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.949
WELL, GEE, DAPHNE,
MAYBE YOU COULD
GET OVER THAT.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.821
WELL, GEE, CHARLIE,
MAYBE YOU COULD PICK
ANOTHER NAME.

31:06.821 --> 31:10.172
BECAUSE OF SOME
NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR
YOU HAD 20 YEARS AGO?

31:10.172 --> 31:11.913
YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S
A LITTLE RIDICULOUS?

31:11.913 --> 31:14.655
WHAT? I DON'T WANT
MY KID NAMED AFTER
SOME BULLY.

31:14.655 --> 31:18.137
DAPHNE, IT'S
MY MOTHER'S NAME.

31:18.137 --> 31:21.662
MY MOTHER...
WHO I LOVED, WHO DIED,

31:21.662 --> 31:25.361
AND WHO THIS CHILD
IS NEVER GONNA GET
TO SEE OR KNOW.

31:25.361 --> 31:28.016
I WANT HER TO HAVE
SOMETHING OF HER
GRANDMOTHER'S,

31:28.016 --> 31:30.976
AND YOU CAN'T
JUST VETO THIS ON
THE GROUNDS THAT--

31:30.976 --> 31:32.542
WHAT, I DON'T
GET A VOTE?

31:32.542 --> 31:34.893
ONLY IF IT REALLY
MATTERS TO YOU.

31:34.893 --> 31:38.635
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT REALLY MATTERS
TO ME, A LOT.

31:40.681 --> 31:44.076
NOW, I THINK
THE PERSON WHO CARES
THE MOST SHOULD WIN.

31:49.081 --> 31:51.997
IT'S--FINE.
IT'S YOUR CALL.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.577
THAT'S...

32:07.577 --> 32:09.275
WOW.

32:09.275 --> 32:11.451
I KNOW.

32:11.451 --> 32:15.455
[GIGGLING]

32:15.455 --> 32:17.674
SO--SO, LET'S SEE,
WHAT DOES THAT--

32:17.674 --> 32:22.505
THAT MEANS, UH...
BARBIE DOLLS...
AND MY LITTLE PONY,

32:22.505 --> 32:26.335
AND BALLET LESSONS
AND "WHY CAN'T I GET
MY EARS PIERCED

32:26.335 --> 32:29.686
WHEN EVERYONE ELSE
IN NURSERY SCHOOL HAS
THEIR EARS PIERCED?"

32:29.686 --> 32:32.211
WHOLE BALL OF WAX.

32:32.211 --> 32:35.388
YOU ARE IN SERIOUS
TROUBLE, MAN.

32:35.388 --> 32:37.564
WHY? HOW DO
YOU FIGURE?

32:37.564 --> 32:39.740
WELL, THERE'S
GONNA COME A DAY

32:39.740 --> 32:42.134
WHEN SHE WALKS
THROUGH THE DOOR

32:42.134 --> 32:45.093
4 HOURS AFTER HER
CURFEW, AND SHE'S
GOT A HICKEY

32:45.093 --> 32:47.574
ON HER NECK THE
SIZE OF A BASEBALL,

32:47.574 --> 32:49.445
AND SHE DECLARES
HER UNDYING LOVE

32:49.445 --> 32:52.405
FOR A GUY WHO'S
GOT A TATTOO
ON HIS BICEP

32:52.405 --> 32:54.059
THAT READS
"BORN DEAD."

32:54.059 --> 32:55.756
A GUY NAMED "MEAT,"

32:55.756 --> 32:58.106
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN
HIS NICKNAME.

32:58.106 --> 33:01.631
MAN, I SHOULD JUST
START SAVING FOR
YOUR BAIL RIGHT NOW.

33:01.631 --> 33:02.893
PROBABLY.

33:05.374 --> 33:09.378
THEY SAY LITTLE GIRLS
REALLY LOVE THEIR FATHERS.

33:09.378 --> 33:12.425
OR DO YOU THINK
THAT'S JUST SOMETHING
PEOPLE SAY?

33:14.514 --> 33:16.559
NO. THAT SOUNDS
RIGHT TO ME.

33:19.432 --> 33:21.129
I'M GONNA NAME
HER DIANA.

33:22.348 --> 33:23.697
AFTER MOM.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.573
WOW.

33:30.573 --> 33:31.835
THAT'S...

33:36.275 --> 33:38.277
THAT'S JUST...
I'M SORRY.

33:38.277 --> 33:39.800
NO, THAT'S OK.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.673
I BEEN KINDA WELLING UP
ABOUT IT, TOO.

33:46.154 --> 33:49.027
THERE'LL BE ANOTHER
DIANA SALINGER
IN THE WORLD.

33:52.291 --> 33:53.161
YEAH.

34:03.606 --> 34:06.609
HEY. I'M SORRY
I'M LATE.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.785
CHARLIE SHOWED UP
AT THE RESTAURANT,

34:08.785 --> 34:10.744
AND THERE WAS
HORRIBLE TRAFFIC.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.789
YOU WERE RIGHT.

34:12.789 --> 34:14.661
OK? YOU WERE RIGHT.

34:14.661 --> 34:16.141
I'M SORRY?

34:16.141 --> 34:18.926
YOU WERE RIGHT, AND I WAS WRONG.
JUST SAY IT.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.928
SAY IT AND
GET IT OVER WITH

34:20.928 --> 34:24.410
BECAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY
UNDERSTAND HUMAN NATURE,
AND I DO NOT.

34:30.459 --> 34:32.461
YOU WENT TO SEE
YOUR GRANDPARENTS.

34:32.461 --> 34:35.116
I WENT TO SEE
A 70-SOMETHING-
YEAR-OLD MAN

34:35.116 --> 34:37.727
WHO'S PRETTY MUCH
OUT OF IT SINCE
HIS DAUGHTER DIED,

34:37.727 --> 34:40.078
AND DIDN'T TAKE TOO WELL
TO A STRANGE TEENAGER

34:40.078 --> 34:43.298
SHOWING UP AND ANNOUNCING
THAT SHE'S HIS LONG-LOST
FAMILY.

34:43.298 --> 34:46.388
HE...DIDN'T TELL
YOU ANYTHING?

34:46.388 --> 34:48.042
NOTHING.

34:48.042 --> 34:51.176
I GOT NOTHING FROM HIM.

34:51.176 --> 34:54.266
NOTHING ABOUT HER,
NOTHING ABOUT MY FATHER,

34:54.266 --> 34:59.532
NOT A PICTURE OR A SCARF
OR EVEN A PAIR OF SHOES
TO REMEMBER HER BY.

35:05.668 --> 35:06.582
I'M SORRY.

35:16.592 --> 35:20.292
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
OF HERS TO HOLD ONTO.

35:22.729 --> 35:24.600
SHE LEFT ME
WITHOUT ANYTHING.

35:27.386 --> 35:28.604
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

35:39.006 --> 35:41.356
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

35:41.356 --> 35:42.357
ALGEBRA.

35:42.357 --> 35:43.924
YEAH,
ALGEBRA HELL.

35:45.839 --> 35:46.753
SOUNDS UGLY.

35:49.582 --> 35:52.715
YOU GUYS PLANNING ON
WORKING STRAIGHT THROUGH?

35:52.715 --> 35:55.718
I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE
ANY PLANS FOR TONIGHT?

35:55.718 --> 35:57.720
YEAH, BUT WE
WOULDN'T WANT

35:57.720 --> 35:59.592
TO BURDEN YOU
OR ANYTHING.

36:00.854 --> 36:03.117
RIGHT.

36:03.117 --> 36:05.859
LISTEN, I KIND OF
WANNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

36:05.859 --> 36:06.860
FORGET IT.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.122
YOU'RE SMART.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.558
YOU WANT THE GRADES.
NO BIGGIE.

36:09.558 --> 36:10.907
GIVE ME A BREAK.

36:10.907 --> 36:12.866
IT'S JUST THAT
SNEAKING OUT AT NIGHT

36:12.866 --> 36:15.347
IS NOT, LIKE,
SOME BIG THRILL FOR ME.

36:15.347 --> 36:17.262
UH-HUH.

36:17.262 --> 36:20.221
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING
IS, FOR YOU GUYS,
IT'S, LIKE,

36:20.221 --> 36:23.224
"OH, MY GOD.
I'M AWAY FROM MY
PARENTS. I'M FREE.

36:23.224 --> 36:26.401
"I'M FREE TO JUST
GO WHEREVER I WANT,
DO WHATEVER I WANT,

36:26.401 --> 36:30.013
AND BREAK ALL THE RULES
THAT I CAN BREAK."
I MEAN, RIGHT?

36:31.798 --> 36:34.148
WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY RULES, OK?

36:34.148 --> 36:38.500
AND FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS,
I COULD STAY OUT AS LATE
AS I WANTED,

36:38.500 --> 36:40.981
AND NO ONE ASKED ME
WHERE I WAS GOING,

36:40.981 --> 36:43.026
AND NO ONE ASKED ME
WHERE I WAS WHEN
I CAME BACK.

36:45.507 --> 36:48.815
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING
TO REBEL AGAINST.

36:48.815 --> 36:51.470
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO ESCAPE FROM ANYONE

36:51.470 --> 36:54.473
OR CUT THE STRINGS
WITH MY PARENTS.

36:54.473 --> 36:56.301
RIGHT.

36:56.301 --> 36:58.781
I--I CAN
SEE THAT.

36:58.781 --> 37:02.872
I'M JUST SAYING
I CAME HERE 'CAUSE
THIS IS A GOOD SCHOOL,

37:02.872 --> 37:07.137
AND I DON'T HAVE TO STUDY
IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
GREAT TO DO...

37:07.137 --> 37:10.532
BUT JUST TO SNEAK OUT...

37:10.532 --> 37:14.536
IT'S KINDA LIKE...
BEEN THERE. DONE THAT.

37:23.937 --> 37:26.113
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
A LITTLE THIRSTY.

37:26.113 --> 37:29.072
NO. MAYBE LATER.
THANKS.

37:35.557 --> 37:38.168
WE HAVE, UH...
LAMAZE CLASS
TONIGHT AT 6:00--

37:38.168 --> 37:39.518
I KNOW THAT.

37:39.518 --> 37:41.476
NO. I WAS
JUST SAYING--

37:41.476 --> 37:43.870
I MEAN, I WAS
JUST THINKING
THAT MAYBE AFTER,

37:43.870 --> 37:46.002
WE COULD, UH,
GO OUT TO DINNER.

37:46.002 --> 37:50.529
THERE'S THIS NEW
GREEK PLACE ON GEARY
I HEARD ABOUT.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.574
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE PRETTY GOOD.

37:52.574 --> 37:54.533
ONE OF THOSE
PLATE-SMASHING
RESTAURANTS?

37:54.533 --> 37:56.099
SOUNDS PERFECT FOR US.

37:58.058 --> 37:59.755
DAPHNE...

37:59.755 --> 38:02.410
I'M SORRY. LOOK,
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
TRYING TO BE NICE.

38:02.410 --> 38:03.759
HEY, I AM NICE.

38:03.759 --> 38:05.457
WELL, I AM NICE, TOO.

38:05.457 --> 38:08.329
I AM NOT A BAD PERSON,
CHARLIE.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.070
I KNOW YOU THINK I AM--

38:10.070 --> 38:12.507
NO, I DON'T.
I DON'T.

38:12.507 --> 38:16.555
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
HAVING A HARD TIME
WITH ALL THIS STUFF,

38:16.555 --> 38:20.559
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
SAME HERE. ME, TOO.

38:20.559 --> 38:24.040
BUT, DAPHNE,
THIS BABY'S
COMING...

38:24.040 --> 38:27.566
NO MATTER WHAT IS
GOING ON BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US,

38:27.566 --> 38:28.828
SHE'S ON HER WAY.

38:28.828 --> 38:31.178
I KNOW THAT.

38:31.178 --> 38:34.834
AND THE WAY I SEE
IT, YOU AND ME,

38:34.834 --> 38:37.837
WE HAVE 9 WEEKS
TO GET OUR ACT
TOGETHER,

38:37.837 --> 38:42.668
TO FIND A WAY TO
BE OK TOGETHER,
AND...

38:42.668 --> 38:47.325
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY
HOW TO DO THAT OR HOW
TO GET THERE, BUT...

38:50.153 --> 38:54.114
MAYBE IT STARTS WITH
A LITTLE SOUVLAKI.

38:54.114 --> 38:55.811
OH, I HATE SOUVLAKI.

39:01.426 --> 39:05.908
DO YOU THINK
MAYBE THEY HAVE THOSE
GRAPE-LEAF THINGIES?

39:13.742 --> 39:15.353
AND...SIGN THERE.

39:17.006 --> 39:19.922
ABOUT HOW LONG SHOULD IT
TAKE TO BECOME OFFICIAL?

39:19.922 --> 39:22.621
COUPLE OF WEEKS...
AND A CHECK.

39:22.621 --> 39:23.491
RIGHT.

39:25.014 --> 39:28.278
SO, UH...ALL-NEW
STATIONARY, HUH?

39:28.278 --> 39:30.498
YEAH, I
SUPPOSE SO.

39:32.282 --> 39:35.111
HEY...I DON'T BELIEVE
WE'VE MET.

39:35.111 --> 39:38.114
I'M BAILEY SALINGER.

39:38.114 --> 39:40.595
SARAH REEVES...
MERRIN.

39:47.950 --> 39:49.822
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

40:01.137 --> 40:02.356
[KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK]

40:04.750 --> 40:05.620
HEY.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.319
HEY.

40:12.845 --> 40:14.803
CHOCOLATE
CHOCOLATE CHIP.

40:14.803 --> 40:18.198
IT KINDA MELTED.
I HAD TO STUFF IT
UNDER MY SHIRT

40:18.198 --> 40:20.330
GOING OVER
THE EAST WALL.

40:20.330 --> 40:22.332
THERE'S HOT FUDGE
SAUCE, TOO,

40:22.332 --> 40:25.727
BUT IT MAY HAVE,
LIKE, CONGEALED.

40:25.727 --> 40:28.208
THANKS.

40:28.208 --> 40:30.297
I THINK.

40:30.297 --> 40:34.214
HEY, YOU TELL HER ABOUT
THAT CUTE B.U. GUY
WE MET ON THE "T"?

40:36.782 --> 40:40.438
I DIDN'T WANNA,
LIKE, INTERRUPT YOUR
READING OR ANYTHING.

40:40.438 --> 40:45.094
IT'S OK. I'M JUST,
LIKE, DROOLING OVER
CHAPTER 18.

40:45.094 --> 40:47.096
YOU'RE KIDDING.
IT GETS KINDA SEXY?

40:47.096 --> 40:50.709
NO. I MEANT,
LITERALLY...
DROOLING.

40:50.709 --> 40:52.450
OH, THAT'S GROSS.
EWW.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.017
SO, YOU GUYS MET
A COLLEGE GUY?

40:55.017 --> 40:57.106
YEAH, BUT OUR
FIRST MISTAKE

40:57.106 --> 40:59.152
WAS SAYING WE WERE
COLLEGE STUDENTS.

40:59.152 --> 41:01.807
LISA'S ALL, "WE'RE,
LIKE, FRESHMEN
AT HARVARD."

41:01.807 --> 41:03.156
YEAH, AND HE
WAS, LIKE,

41:03.156 --> 41:04.679
"NO KIDDING.
SO'S MY SISTER.

41:04.679 --> 41:06.638
WHERE DO
YOU GUYS LIVE
IN THE YARD?"

41:06.638 --> 41:08.030
UH-OH.
YEAH!
HA HA!

41:08.030 --> 41:09.858
Ned:
IT'S COMPLETELY
UNDERSTANDABLE.

41:09.858 --> 41:12.034
Julia:
NO, IT ISN'T.
I'M A NUT CASE.

41:12.034 --> 41:13.906
SO YOU OVERREACTED
A LITTLE.

41:13.906 --> 41:15.385
A LITTLE?

41:15.385 --> 41:17.649
YOU WOULDN'T
SAY THAT IF YOU'D BEEN THERE.

41:17.649 --> 41:19.825
GOD, POOR JOSH.

41:19.825 --> 41:23.785
POOR, MISERABLE,
IN-WAY- OVER-HIS-HEAD, AND
DOESN'T- KNOW-WHAT-HIT-HIM JOSH.

41:23.785 --> 41:25.091
JULIA...

41:25.091 --> 41:27.180
DON'T TRY AND
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

41:27.180 --> 41:31.489
JUST GO BACK TO WHATEVER
YOU WERE DOING IN YOUR
RESEARCH OR...WHATEVER.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.317
POLITICAL STRUCTURE
OF THE EARLY
OTTOMAN EMPIRE.

41:34.317 --> 41:38.191
MM. I'M SO SORRY
YOU HAD TO RUN INTO
THE LUNATIC GIRL

41:38.191 --> 41:41.324
WHO'S HIDING DOWN
IN THE STACKS BECAUSE
SHE UTTERLY INCAPABLE

41:41.324 --> 41:43.892
OF ORDINARY
HUMAN INTERACTION.

41:43.892 --> 41:46.852
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS?

41:46.852 --> 41:49.898
YES. I'M A LUNATIC GIRL
WHO'S UTTERLY INCAPABLE

41:49.898 --> 41:51.770
OF ORDINARY
HUMAN INTERACTION.

41:53.815 --> 41:55.991
YOU'VE GOT THAT
FIRST-HUMP PROBLEM.

41:55.991 --> 41:59.299
HUMP? I HAVE
A HUMP NOW?

41:59.299 --> 42:01.127
OBSTACLE.

42:01.127 --> 42:05.000
YOU'VE GOT THIS
REALLY OLD FAILED
RELATIONSHIP,

42:05.000 --> 42:07.002
LIKE, SINCE
HIGH SCHOOL,

42:07.002 --> 42:10.136
AND IT'S OVER,
AND YOU KNOW
IT'S OVER,

42:10.136 --> 42:12.268
BUT STILL, YOU'RE
KIND OF AFRAID
OF ANYTHING

42:12.268 --> 42:15.576
THAT ACKNOWLEDGES
THE OVERNESS OF IT.

42:15.576 --> 42:18.884
"THE OVERNESS OF IT."

42:18.884 --> 42:20.407
I'M LOST.

42:20.407 --> 42:22.409
IT'S THE
FIRST BIG STEP

42:22.409 --> 42:24.106
THAT'S SCREWING
YOU UP HERE.

42:24.106 --> 42:25.760
LIKE,
THE FIRST KISS.

42:25.760 --> 42:27.327
MM-HMM.

42:27.327 --> 42:29.721
YOU JUST GOTTA
DO IT.

42:29.721 --> 42:32.898
YOU GOTTA KISS
SOMEONE OTHER THAN
THAT GRIFFIN.

42:32.898 --> 42:37.293
ALL RIGHT. SO,
I KISS JOSH, AND
EVERYTHING'S FINE?

42:37.293 --> 42:40.862
NO. I DON'T THINK SO.
I THINK I'D FEEL WORSE.

42:40.862 --> 42:44.039
NO, NO. 'CAUSE
IT'S, LIKE...

42:44.039 --> 42:46.564
"WOW.
LIGHTNING DIDN'T
STRIKE ME DEAD.

42:46.564 --> 42:47.782
"THE WORLD
ISN'T OVER.

42:47.782 --> 42:49.610
"I HAVEN'T DONE
A TERRIBLE THING,

42:49.610 --> 42:51.264
"AND THERE'S LIFE
AFTER GRIFFIN,

42:51.264 --> 42:54.484
AND THERE'S
SOMEONE ELSE OUT
THERE FOR ME."

42:54.484 --> 42:56.182
I DON'T THINK SO.

42:57.357 --> 42:58.967
YOU GOTTA TRY.

43:00.360 --> 43:01.622
I CAN'T.

43:03.058 --> 43:04.625
SURE, YOU CAN.

43:13.329 --> 43:15.288
OH, MY GOD.

43:15.288 --> 43:17.769
NOW IT ALL
GETS EASIER.

43:29.911 --> 43:31.434
VARY THE PATTERN, BOB.

43:31.434 --> 43:34.263
FIRST 4 FINGERS,
THEN ONE FINGER,
THEN 3 FINGERS.

43:34.263 --> 43:36.570
KEEP HER GUESSING.
KEEP HER FOCUSED
RIGHT ON YOU.

43:36.570 --> 43:39.442
OK? GOOD WORK.
GOOD.

43:39.442 --> 43:41.619
REMEMBER,
SHORT BREATHS OF AIR.

43:41.619 --> 43:44.622
HEE! HEE! HEE!
HOOO...

43:44.622 --> 43:46.972
HEE! HEE! HEE!

43:46.972 --> 43:48.843
HEY, FELLAS,
LET'S NOT FORGET,

43:48.843 --> 43:51.367
A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT
GOES A LONG WAY.

43:51.367 --> 43:53.195
HEE! HOOO...
THERE YOU GO,
LAURINE.

43:53.195 --> 43:55.023
HEE--HUH?

43:55.023 --> 43:56.024
AND...
20 MORE SECONDS.

43:56.024 --> 43:57.896
OW.

43:57.896 --> 44:00.420
NOT TO BE A STICKLER
HERE, DAPH, BUT IT'S
"HEE! HEE--"

44:00.420 --> 44:01.595
CA-AN'T.

44:01.595 --> 44:02.944
SURE, YOU CAN.

44:02.944 --> 44:06.600
NO. HA-VING-A-
CON-TRAC-TION.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.645
OK, GET READY...

44:07.645 --> 44:10.430

YOU'RE WHAT?

44:10.430 --> 44:11.779
HERE COMES
ANOTHER ONE.

44:11.779 --> 44:13.563
GET SOMEBODY...
FA-AST...

44:13.563 --> 44:14.521

44:16.392 --> 44:17.872
GOOD JOB,
BUT, HONEY,

44:17.872 --> 44:19.918
WHEN THE REAL
THING HAPPENS,

44:19.918 --> 44:21.963
TRY NOT TO CLENCH
QUITE SO MUCH.

44:21.963 --> 44:24.313
NO, YOU DON'T...
WON'T...STOP...

44:24.313 --> 44:25.750
THIS IS
THE REAL THING.

44:25.750 --> 44:27.316
SHE'S HAVING
CONTRACTIONS.

44:27.316 --> 44:28.927
MAKE IT LOOK,
STOP... DO SOMETHING.
PLEASE.

44:28.927 --> 44:32.321
UH, BUT...THIS
ISN'T SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN--

44:32.321 --> 44:34.541
DO SOMETHING!

44:34.541 --> 44:36.064
CALL AN AMBULANCE.

44:36.064 --> 44:37.326
[FRETFUL]
CHARLIE...

44:37.326 --> 44:39.241
DAPHNE, LOOK AT ME,
LOOK AT ME.

44:39.241 --> 44:41.417
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.
YOU'RE GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT.

44:41.417 --> 44:44.246
DAPHNE, LOOK AT ME,
LOOK AT ME.

44:44.246 --> 44:47.423
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.
YOU'RE GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT.
