BUT THAT GNARLY WITCH MOLE
IS GETTING HAIRY.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.813
- IT'S NOT HAIR.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.648
I TRIED TO SCRUB IT OFF
WITH STEEL WOOL,

09:25.731 --> 09:29.193
AND A COUPLE FIBERS
GOT STUCK.

09:29.277 --> 09:32.405
- WHATEVER YOU DID,
IT'S CREEPING ME OUT.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.788
- YEAH, THAT'S GOOD,
THAT'S GOOD.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.873
- I'M NOT SURE THIS IS
GONNA BE POSSIBLE.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.750
IT'S SO TINY!

09:44.834 --> 09:46.294
- OKAY, THAT'S NOT
THE BEST THING TO SAY TO A MAN

09:46.377 --> 09:48.004
WHO JUST TOOK OFF HIS PANTS.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.548
- MAYBE IF I SCOOTCH
AROUND THIS WAY.

09:50.631 --> 09:54.552
[toilet flushes]

09:54.635 --> 09:57.179
PRETEND THAT'S A WATERFALL.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.557
- I'M SORRY, SOMEHOW I IMAGINED
THIS WOULD BE SEXIER.

09:59.640 --> 10:03.811
- THERE IS NO REASON WE CAN'T
MAKE THIS SEXY.

10:03.894 --> 10:04.937
OH, HELLO, MOM.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.357
OH, GOD, AIRPLANE MIRRORS.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.318
- OH, GOD! OH, GOD!

10:10.401 --> 10:11.402
- ARE YOU AFRAID OF FLYING?

10:11.485 --> 10:13.863
- TERRIFIED.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.698
I USUALLY TAKE PILLS
BEFORE I FLY,

10:15.781 --> 10:18.701
BUT THAT'S NOT CONDUCIVE
TO HAVING ONE'S TRAY TABLE

10:18.784 --> 10:20.536
IN THE FULL UPRIGHT POSITION.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.163
OKAY.
OH! OKAY!

10:22.246 --> 10:24.874
I DON'T WANNA DIE!

10:24.957 --> 10:27.668
YES, I SEE THE IRONY,
BUT I WANT MY FULL THREE MONTHS.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.712
- OKAY.
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.380
FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.344
- OH.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.720
YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.

10:37.803 --> 10:41.390
- OKAY, NOW LET'S DO THIS.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.976
- ATTENTION, PASSENGERS,
WE'RE ENCOUNTERING TURBULENCE.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.396
PLEASE RETURN
TO YOUR SEATS IMMEDIATELY.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.190
- OKAY.

10:49.273 --> 10:52.193
THE CLASSY WAY TO DO THIS
IS FOR US TO LEAVE SEPARATELY.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.861
I'LL GO OUT FIRST, YOU COME OUT
A FEW MINUTES LATER.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.029
NO ONE'S THE WISER.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.739
- AND FOR THE COUPLE
IN THE BATHROOM,

10:56.822 --> 10:58.407
YOU'VE GOT QUITE
A WALK OF SHAME

10:58.491 --> 11:01.077
BACK TO 31 "A" AND "B".

11:01.160 --> 11:03.079
- THOSE AREN'T OUR SEATS!

11:03.162 --> 11:06.916
- I'M SORRY, 34 "A" AND "B".

11:06.999 --> 11:08.042
- YOU GO FIRST.

11:13.798 --> 11:14.965
- OH, THIS IS SO EXCITING.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.384
LOOK IT,
MODELS EVERYWHERE,

11:16.467 --> 11:17.760
AND I'M ONE OF THEM.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.595
BUT DON'T TELL VICTORIA
HOW EXCITED I AM.

11:19.678 --> 11:22.056
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT
PRACTICING DEAD EYES.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.310
- MMM.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.354
- OW, OW, OW.

11:28.437 --> 11:30.106
- WHAT DID YOU PUT
THIS DISGUSTING THING ON WITH?

11:30.189 --> 11:31.941
AND IS THAT
A GREY HAIR ON IT?

11:32.024 --> 11:33.484
- NO, IT'S DENTAL FLOSS.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.404
I TRIED TO FLOSS IT OFF.

11:36.487 --> 11:39.615
- I'LL TRY TO COVER IT UP.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.659
- SO YOU NEVER GOT TO JOIN
THE MILE-HIGH CLUB WITH GEORGE?

11:41.742 --> 11:43.452
- NO.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.455
BUT WE DID JOIN THE EMPTY SBARRO
IN THE TOLEDO AIRPORT CLUB.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.834
IT WAS FUN ACTUALLY.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.919
- BUT ISN'T IT
KIND OF DEPRESSING,

11:52.002 --> 11:53.087
YOU KNOW, HANGING OUT
WITH SOMEONE

11:53.170 --> 11:54.505
THAT YOU KNOW
IS GONNA DIE SOON?

11:54.588 --> 11:55.798
- I SUPPOSE.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.134
BUT GEORGE IS
SO DETERMINED TO ENJOY

11:58.217 --> 11:59.593
WHAT LITTLE TIME
HE HAS LEFT.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.762
HE'S AN ABSOLUTE JOY
TO BE AROUND.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.806
THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID
FOR DATING A MAN

12:03.889 --> 12:05.141
WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE.

12:05.224 --> 12:08.936
HE'S KIND,
FORTHCOMING, DIRECT,

12:09.019 --> 12:11.188
AND UP FOR EVERYTHING.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.314
BUT...

12:12.398 --> 12:14.316
- HE HAS AN EXPIRATION DATE.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.651
- EXACTLY.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.695
- YOU FALLING FOR HIM?

12:17.778 --> 12:19.488
- I CAN'T LET MYSELF.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.031
WHICH IS NOT FAIR TO HIM,

12:21.115 --> 12:25.119
BUT I CAN'T PUT MYSELF THROUGH
THAT KIND OF HEARTBREAK.

12:25.202 --> 12:26.662
I MIGHT HAVE
TO END THINGS WITH HIM

12:26.745 --> 12:28.789
BEFORE IT GETS
TO THAT POINT.

12:28.873 --> 12:29.874
- WELL, THAT MAKES
WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO

12:29.957 --> 12:31.625
SEEM REALLY TRIVIAL.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.502
- OKAY, PEOPLE, REMEMBER,
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

12:33.586 --> 12:37.173
WE'LL EVER DO IN OUR LIVES.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.716
- VICTORIA,
YOU'RE ON IN TEN MINUTES.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.593
YOUR OTHER MODELS WILL MEET YOU
AT THE TOP OF THE RUNWAY.

12:40.676 --> 12:41.802
- GOT IT.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.554
- THERE ARE OTHER MODELS?

12:43.637 --> 12:45.848
- THERE ARE?

12:45.931 --> 12:47.516
- THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.352
- HUH.
NEWS TO ME.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.690
- SO YOU'RE DYING, HUH?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.192
- THAT'S RIGHT.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.861
- JUST LIKE THE REST OF US.
- EXACTLY.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.322
- HOW'S IT GOING SO FAR?

13:01.405 --> 13:03.199
- THE DYING?
- UH-HUH.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.700
- PRETTY GOOD.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.702
I MEAN,
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

13:06.785 --> 13:10.122
JUST TRYING TO SOAK UP
AS MUCH AS I CAN OUT OF LIFE.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.208
- CAN I SEE
YOUR BUCKET LIST?

13:12.291 --> 13:15.878
- SURE.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.048
- OH, A HOT DOG IN
A HAMBURGER BUN.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.091
OH, THAT'S FANTASTIC.

13:21.175 --> 13:24.512
PROMISE ME YOU'LL DO THAT ONE.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.097
- SURE.

13:27.181 --> 13:32.102
NOW, SINCE I CAN'T PUT
"GROWING OLD" ON MY BUCKET LIST,

13:32.186 --> 13:35.439
WHAT'S THE TRUTH ABOUT IT?

13:35.523 --> 13:39.068
- WELL, YOU DON'T POP OUT
OF BED AS FAST.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.694
- MMM.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.404
- AND YOU LEARN NOT TO TAKE
ANYTHING FOR GRANTED.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.115
BUT YOU'VE ALREADY
FIGURED THAT OUT.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.284
- DOES IT MAKE YOU SCARED?

13:47.368 --> 13:49.578
- OH, SCARED
IS A WASTE OF TIME.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.082
THE TRICK IS JUST TO LAUGH
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.333
- OH.

13:54.416 --> 13:57.294
- WHEN YOU LAUGH,
YOU'RE REALLY ALIVE.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.422
AND YOU FORGET
ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.217
- [laughs]

14:05.844 --> 14:09.306
- WELL, YOU HAVE TO WAIT
TILL SOMETHING'S FUNNY.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.725
- OH.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.602
- THAT WAS JUST WEIRD.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.280
- OH, MY GOD,
THESE SHOES ARE GORGEOUS.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.782
I'M GONNA MAKE MILLIONS.

14:26.865 --> 14:30.869
- AH! OW! AHH!

14:30.953 --> 14:32.288
- ARE YOU OKAY?

14:32.371 --> 14:33.497
- YEAH, YEAH, FINE.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.249
JUST A LITTLE PINCH.
I'LL BE FINE.

14:35.332 --> 14:38.210
AH, AH, AH, AH, OW!

14:38.294 --> 14:39.753
- WHAT IS WRONG?

14:39.837 --> 14:40.963
- I'M SORRY, VICTORIA.

14:41.046 --> 14:41.964
THESE SHOES ARE BEAUTIFUL.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.257
THEY'RE JUST REALLY UNSTABLE.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.925
- WELL, THEY'RE
VICTORIA BRAND SHOES.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.177
OF COURSE THEY'RE
BEAUTIFUL AND UNSTABLE.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.308
OH.
OH, DEAR GOD.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.767
THERE'S NO SUPPORT.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.603
- WHAT, YOU CAN'T STAND
IN THEM EITHER?

14:55.686 --> 14:57.146
- I'M TELLING YOU
THESE SHOES

14:57.229 --> 14:58.814
ARE NOT MEANT
TO BE WALKED IN BY HUMANS.

14:58.897 --> 15:01.025
- BUT WE'RE NOT HUMANS,
WE'RE MODELS.

15:01.108 --> 15:04.445
ALL RIGHT, NOW LET ME
SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.322
YOU JUST--HOLY CRAP!

15:06.405 --> 15:07.740
THAT HURTS.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.617
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
YOU'RE UP.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.660
THE WHEELCHAIR MODELS WILL MEET
YOU AT THE TOP OF THE RUNWAY.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.870
- WHEELCHAIR MODELS?

15:12.953 --> 15:14.788
WHY ARE MY MODELS
IN WHEELCHAIRS?

15:14.872 --> 15:17.333
- MAYBE THEY TRIED ON
YOUR SHOES.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.877
- THE EVENT IS CALLED
"WALK AND ROLL."

15:19.960 --> 15:21.545
IT'S A BENEFIT FOR WOMEN
WHO CAN'T WALK

15:21.629 --> 15:23.047
BUT STILL WANT
TO BE FASHIONABLE.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.340
- WHAT?

15:24.423 --> 15:25.674
WHY IS THIS THE FIRST
I'M HEARING ABOUT THIS?

15:25.758 --> 15:26.675
- IT'S NOT.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.677
WE SPOKE ABOUT IT ON FOUR
DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.012
- WAS SHE NODDING AND GOING,
"YES, YES, YES"?

15:30.095 --> 15:31.305
- YEAH.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.891
- YEAH, SHE WASN'T LISTENING.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.684
- OKAY, YOU KNOW, WE REALLY
DON'T HAVE TIME FOR ALL THIS.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.977
YOU'RE ON IN 30 SECONDS.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.647
I SUGGEST YOU GET MOVING.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.024
- WE CAN'T HOBBLE LIKE THIS
NEXT TO WOMEN IN WHEELCHAIRS.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.151
PEOPLE WILL THINK
WE'RE MAKING FUN OF THEM.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.110
- SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

15:45.194 --> 15:47.154
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

15:47.237 --> 15:49.573
THINK ABOUT SOMETHING
OTHER THAN THE PAIN.

15:49.657 --> 15:53.744
MELANIE, YOU HAVE
A HIDEOUS MOLE ON YOUR FACE.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.204
JOY, YOUR BOYFRIEND'S DYING.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.206
OKAY, LET'S GET OUT THERE
AND SELL SOME SHOES.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.166
OW!

16:01.126 --> 16:04.755
THIS IS THE WORST THING THAT'S
EVER HAPPENED TO ANYONE.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.757
OR IS IT?

16:08.509 --> 16:11.053
DID SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT WHEELCHAIR MODELS?

16:11.136 --> 16:12.221
- OH, NO.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.681
YOU'VE GOT THAT LOOK
IN YOUR EYE.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.225
VICTORIA, YOU DO KNOW
THE BEST THING TO DO

16:16.308 --> 16:17.893
IS TO ADMIT
THESE SHOES ARE A DISASTER

16:17.976 --> 16:19.228
AND JUST CALL
THE WHOLE THING OFF?

16:19.311 --> 16:22.981
- YES, YES.
YES, YES, YES.

16:24.983 --> 16:26.235
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

16:26.318 --> 16:28.529
CLEVELAND FASHION WEEK
IS PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE

16:28.612 --> 16:30.948
SHOES BY VICTORIA CHASE.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.583
- TONIGHT I'M PROUD TO PRESENT
VICTORIA CHASE SHOES.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.919
- VICTORIA CHASE SHOES.

16:44.002 --> 16:46.422
- THE ONLY SHOES IN THE WORLD

16:46.505 --> 16:49.091
DESIGNED NEVER
TO BE WALKED IN.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.761
- VICTORIA CHASE SHOES.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.764
- YES, ONLY I, VICTORIA CHASE,
WAS BRAVE ENOUGH

16:55.848 --> 16:57.683
TO DESIGN SHOES EXCLUSIVELY

16:57.766 --> 17:00.269
FOR THE DIFFERENTLY-ABLED
WOMAN.

17:00.352 --> 17:03.105
[applause]

17:03.188 --> 17:06.108
HIGH FASHION HEELS
FOR A WOMAN ON WHEELS.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.943
OH, IF YOU WANT
TO CALL ME A VISIONARY,

17:08.026 --> 17:09.278
THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

17:09.361 --> 17:13.073
MY BUSINESS
IS BEING A VISIONARY.

17:13.156 --> 17:14.825
- EXCUSE ME,
I'M SORRY.

17:14.907 --> 17:16.743
I JUST, I CAN'T LISTEN
TO THIS ANYMORE.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.287
- MODELS DON'T SPEAK,
DARLING.

17:18.369 --> 17:19.621
UNLESS THEY'RE SAYING...

17:19.704 --> 17:22.290
- VICTORIA CHASE SHOES.

17:22.374 --> 17:25.794
- IT'S JUST THAT WE CAN WEAR
WHATEVER SHOES WE WANT.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.838
- BUT NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.131
- BUT THAT'S INSANE.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.633
WE DON'T NEED
VICTORIA CHASE SHOES.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.052
- VICTORIA CHASE SHOES.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.312
- OH, YOU'RE REALLY
GOOD AT THIS.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.105
- YEAH, YOU STARTING
TO FEEL ANYTHING?

17:45.189 --> 17:47.983
- UNFORTUNATELY, YES.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.818
GEORGE, CAN WE TALK?

17:49.902 --> 17:51.862
- UH-OH.

17:51.945 --> 17:54.448
EVERY BAD CONVERSATION
IN THE WORLD STARTS WITH,

17:54.531 --> 17:55.991
"CAN WE TALK?"

17:56.074 --> 17:58.410
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PUT THIS.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.329
- LET ME HELP.

18:00.412 --> 18:04.374
YOU MET THIS FANTASTICALLY
SEXY, HANDSOME, FUNNY,

18:04.458 --> 18:07.169
SEXY GUY,

18:07.252 --> 18:09.338
BUT THE DUDE
IS ABOUT TO CROAK.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.007
AND IF HE WAS ANY KIND
OF A GENTLEMAN,

18:12.090 --> 18:14.468
HE WOULD SAY GOOD-BYE NOW.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.470
- I'M SORRY.

18:16.553 --> 18:18.180
I'M JUST SCARED.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.182
- SCARED'S A WASTE OF TIME.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.519
I GET IT.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.480
GOOD-BYE, JOY.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.863
I WISH SAYING,
"WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE SBARRO"

18:34.947 --> 18:38.158
WAS AS ROMANTIC AS SAYING,
"WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE PARIS."

18:41.995 --> 18:43.205
- GEORGE, WAIT.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.208
- RIGHT HERE.

18:46.291 --> 18:49.378
- WHAT MIGHT WE CROSS OFF
THAT LIST ON OUR SECOND DATE?

18:49.461 --> 18:51.213
- NUMBER FIVE.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.591
- I KEEP TELLING YOU,
I AM NOT DOING NUMBER FIVE.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.386
