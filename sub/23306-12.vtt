05:59.567 --> 06:01.277

more fine art?

06:01.360 --> 06:02.737

butterflies or something.

06:05.364 --> 06:06.324

06:34.519 --> 06:36.896
- But I mean, do you want
to go that simple?

06:36.979 --> 06:38.147

09:10.424 --> 09:12.051
- Hey, torch. Hurry, hurry.

09:12.134 --> 09:14.220
<i>- We did three wolves in the</i>
<i>beginning and let the wax dry.</i>

09:14.303 --> 09:15.471
{\an8}But now we're peeling
off the tape,

09:15.554 --> 09:16.847
{\an8}chunks are just flying off.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.808
<i>I mean, it's ruining</i>
<i>our whole design.</i>

09:18.891 --> 09:19.725
- How much time?
- Like, none.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.730
- Five, four, three,

09:24.814 --> 09:27.858
two, one.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.653
That's it. Time is up.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.864
{\an1}- Hey, ours looks by far
the [bleep] raddest.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.783
And theirs is
just so boring.

09:35.866 --> 09:39.578
- The shading in the flag
kind of looks like clouds.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.830
- I think it's cool, man.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.542
- All right. Time to
critique your work.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.335
Team DJ, you're up.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.005
Your use of the
butterflies in the foreground

09:49.088 --> 09:50.381
was really a smart play,

09:50.464 --> 09:52.717
because you have so much depth
in the background

09:52.800 --> 09:56.220
that your negative space
is a really neat effect.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.555
- It would've been
a lot stronger

09:57.638 --> 09:59.890
if you left the butterflies
completely stark.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.517
- Man, we debated that.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.894
- The color blends and
the fades that you get here

10:03.978 --> 10:05.604
<i>between the red and the brown,</i>

10:05.688 --> 10:07.106
<i>and having the different color</i>
<i>fields all playing</i>

10:07.189 --> 10:10.693
<i>into each other really do</i>
<i>cater to a painterly style.</i>

10:10.776 --> 10:12.528
You guys do something that's
definitely artistic.

10:12.611 --> 10:14.655
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.449
{\an8}- Yo, I thought Team DJ
had this in the bag

10:16.532 --> 10:17.825
{\an8}until they added
these butterflies

10:17.908 --> 10:20.077
<i>and these weird boogers</i>
<i>all over the face.</i>

10:21.620 --> 10:22.997
- Next up is Team Steve.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.999
- It's a very
simplistic take,

10:25.082 --> 10:26.917
<i>but yet has a nice</i>
<i>balance to it.</i>

10:27.001 --> 10:28.711
<i>Looking for</i>
<i>composition in this piece,</i>

10:28.794 --> 10:31.005
<i>you have the silhouette of</i>
<i>the cityscape at the bottom,</i>

10:31.088 --> 10:32.381
<i>and then the flag</i>
<i>in the background</i>

10:32.465 --> 10:33.716
<i>with a lot</i>
<i>of negative space.</i>

10:33.799 --> 10:35.217
<i>And you do get</i>
<i>a lot of tones.</i>

10:35.301 --> 10:37.511
<i>You do get it to look</i>
<i>like a runny painting.</i>

10:37.595 --> 10:39.305
It is a very bold, strong move.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.931
- You feel an immediate
response, a knee-jerk.

10:41.015 --> 10:45.311
It does spark emotion, and does
register a feeling with me.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.730
all: Thank you.

10:47.813 --> 10:48.939
{\an8}- I am super proud of my team,
and especially Jeremy.

10:49.023 --> 10:52.026
<i>I mean, me and Roly</i>
<i>were kind of lost,</i>

10:52.109 --> 10:53.903
<i>and Jeremy pulled us through.</i>

10:53.986 --> 10:55.071
I think we've got a winner.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.449
- Team Anthony.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.076
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>it's a really realistic look.</i>

11:00.159 --> 11:03.287
As far as composition goes,
it's pretty plain.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.082
Just a ton of trees,
equidistant almost all the way

11:06.165 --> 11:07.375
<i>across the background.</i>

11:07.458 --> 11:09.460
- There's so many vertical
lines up and down,

11:09.543 --> 11:11.587
I can't help but just
read a bar code.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.005
<i>- Are they looking at the same</i>
<i>[bleep] I'm looking at?</i>

11:13.089 --> 11:15.257
{\an8}I mean, you have foreground,
middle ground, background.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.343
{\an8}You can see it all.
And made out of wax?

11:17.426 --> 11:19.512
{\an8}I mean, come on.
Give us a break.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.848
- All right, judges. It is
time to determine a winner.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.601
- Because of the layout
of Team Anthony's,

11:25.684 --> 11:27.103
there's nothing that
breaks the stripes,

11:27.186 --> 11:28.938
I think that one is
the one that is out.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.982
My decision will be between
Steve and DG.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.025
- I agree.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.111
- The actual composition
of the face,

11:35.194 --> 11:37.613
<i>which is a stark image with</i>
<i>butterflies over the top,</i>

11:37.697 --> 11:40.282
has more of a balance
to the whole piece.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.118
I'm gonna
play with DJ.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.413
- But for this challenge, we're
looking at negative space.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.290
So, my vote is
for Team Steve.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.126
- There's nothing
compositionally pleasing

11:50.209 --> 11:51.627
about that piece
across the board.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.796
- I want to see emotion when
I look at an art piece.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.673
This one, I look at it,
evokes emotion.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.299
That's what art is
supposed to do.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.260
- Can any of you three explain
composition? Can you?

11:59.343 --> 12:02.513
Case in point.

12:02.596 --> 12:05.641
- With Steve's, it's a lot
of use of negative space,

12:05.724 --> 12:08.894
and a really stark, bold,
thought-provoking image.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.271
To me, it's cool.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.941
- So, we have one vote DJ,
one vote Steve. Oliver?

12:20.322 --> 12:23.868
The winner of today's flash
challenge is Team Steve.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.328
- The smart move to go
simple and bold,

12:26.412 --> 12:27.538
and a lot of negative space,
made for that

12:27.621 --> 12:30.499
stronger, more legible image.

They're sore winners, they're

{\an8}The judges don't think you're
that good, and neither do I.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.396

my team is ready.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.942
- Canvases. One by one,
please read the artist's name

17:49.026 --> 17:50.778
on the bottom of your skull.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.113
- Roly.
- I got you, bro.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.325
- What does she want?
- The Medusa one.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.869
- Jason.
- Right here.

17:58.952 --> 18:01.163
{\an8}There's already so much work
to go into the Medusa,

18:01.246 --> 18:03.999
<i>I don't know that this is</i>
<i>a tattoo that I can pull off.</i>

18:04.082 --> 18:08.086
- The, like, "I love you" sign.
That's the hardest thing.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.464
- Josh.
- Right here.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.673
- That's the one he wanted.

18:11.757 --> 18:12.424
<i>- This feels like</i>
<i>more of a gift</i>

18:12.508 --> 18:14.092
<i>than a threat right now.</i>

18:14.176 --> 18:16.178
{\an8}I like to do nature things,
and in composition,

18:16.261 --> 18:18.222
{\an8}a landscape is the easiest way
to show that.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.183
- What did he want?

18:21.266 --> 18:22.810
- Negative bear,
with the forest.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.898
- Daniel.
- Yeah, me.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.027
{\an8}- Team Steve is really gunning
for me on this one.

18:32.110 --> 18:35.197
<i>I've got a bear,</i>
<i>a forest, a full galaxy.</i>

18:35.280 --> 18:36.532
It's way too much.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.534
- Juan?
- I got you.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.868
- Elbow pit.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.704
- Graveyard with negative
tombstones.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.706
- Deanna.
- Hey.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.000
{\an8}I get the graveyard
tattoo in the ditch.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.670
{\an8}Of course, it was a target.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.255
- Jeremy.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.676
- You'll have six hours
to show composition

18:55.759 --> 19:01.557
by creating negative space
tattoos. Good luck.

19:02.850 --> 19:03.433
- How are you doing? Josh.
Good to meet you.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.102
- Hi. Good, how are you?

19:05.185 --> 19:06.395
- Today we're looking for
negative space tattoos.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.729
- Some of the snakes are gonna
have to be negative.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.607
{\an8}- We're looking for the
actual negative space to be

19:10.691 --> 19:12.109
{\an8}the heart of the tattoo,
so everything around it

19:12.192 --> 19:14.736
has to accent it
and flow with it.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.154
- How do I create a negative
hand without lines?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.365
- That's the tricky thing
with the fingers.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.367
You can't put those fingers in
without any lines.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.077
- We're basically looking
for any silhouette

19:22.160 --> 19:24.913
that they put in
to be defined by

19:24.997 --> 19:26.331
whatever background
they choose.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.543
{\an3}- So I wanted a black
and grey graveyard,

19:29.626 --> 19:30.752
{\an3}and I would like it
wrapping around down here.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.589
{\an1}- If I could take, like,
a space, like your forearm,

19:33.672 --> 19:35.299
that would be great.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.967

19:37.050 --> 19:38.385

19:38.468 --> 19:40.470

that'll trust me

cool [bleep].

19:41.805 --> 19:44.349

- Cool. That's awesome.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.976
- I'm excited.

19:46.059 --> 19:49.313
- Basically, what I want is
the top of the tattoo to be,

19:49.396 --> 19:52.608
like, a galaxy, and then it
drops down into the forest,

19:52.691 --> 19:54.401
multiple bears if possible.

19:54.484 --> 19:55.193
- But this forest,
this is only, like,

<i>you'd be able to just</i>
<i>move those tentacles</i>

34:18.514 --> 34:20.641
<i>and re-draw them</i>
<i>to fit a better shape.</i>

34:20.725 --> 34:22.685
- We're battling, because he
wants to do everything,

34:22.768 --> 34:24.728
or he wants to do nothing.
And there's no middle ground.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.563
At least it's technically
done right.

34:26.647 --> 34:28.190
I'm a technical guy.
I've got to go with Daniel.

34:28.274 --> 34:31.360
<i>He's had a lot of issues</i>
<i>with trauma.</i>

34:31.444 --> 34:32.820
<i>He doesn't know how to</i>
<i>work with the skin.</i>

34:32.904 --> 34:33.987
<i>- It's beat all over.</i>

34:34.071 --> 34:35.281
- Yes, Daniel's inexperienced,

34:35.364 --> 34:37.324
and it's the second time
he's had this issue

34:37.408 --> 34:38.826
<i>with application.</i>

34:38.909 --> 34:41.661
<i>But I feel Daniel has</i>
<i>just so much more to bring.</i>

34:41.746 --> 34:43.706
- I'm just gonna stick the way
I've always stuck.

34:43.790 --> 34:44.748
I'm gonna go
with Daniel.

34:44.831 --> 34:46.083
- My choice for the
bottom is Jeremy.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.670
- So, today we're
testing composition

34:50.755 --> 34:52.590
with negative
space tattoos.

34:52.672 --> 34:54.007
Who's in the
bottom of the pack today?

34:54.091 --> 34:55.885
- Daniel's definitely
in the bottom today.

34:55.967 --> 34:57.720
<i>- When you have really dry,</i>
<i>brittle skin,</i>

34:57.804 --> 34:58.846
<i>the last thing</i>
<i>you want to do</i>

34:58.930 --> 35:01.140
{\an3}is take a really fine
needle and drag it

35:01.224 --> 35:02.558
over that brittle skin.

35:02.642 --> 35:03.851
<i>What we're seeing from Daniel</i>
<i>at this point</i>

35:03.935 --> 35:07.855
<i>is a lack of experience</i>
<i>that keeps coming up.</i>

35:07.939 --> 35:09.315
- Let's talk about
Jeremy's tattoo.

35:09.398 --> 35:12.860
<i>His technical application</i>
<i>is better than Daniel's.</i>

35:12.944 --> 35:14.779
- Yeah.
<i>- Yet Daniel's reads</i>

35:14.862 --> 35:15.863
better than Jeremy's.

35:15.947 --> 35:16.864
- I agree.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.616
- That anchor
stands out strong.

35:18.699 --> 35:20.493
So, that negative part
of the challenge, he hits it.

35:20.576 --> 35:23.746
But the composition is where
he totally loses it.

35:23.830 --> 35:24.914
<i>Because the legibility</i>
<i>of this tattoo goes down.</i>

35:24.997 --> 35:27.208
The confusion of what's
happening

35:27.291 --> 35:29.043
in this tattoo goes up.

35:29.126 --> 35:32.296
- As for a third, it's got
to be between Jason and Josh.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.631
- Yeah. I would say Jason.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.675
<i>Look at those huge,</i>
<i>oversized snakes.</i>

35:35.758 --> 35:37.134
<i>They're gummy worms</i>
<i>with dots on them.</i>

35:37.218 --> 35:39.720
- You're very true with that.
- That part is not flattering.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.722
- We're going to be getting
into this part of this

35:41.806 --> 35:43.432
competition where there
is no more middle.

35:43.516 --> 35:46.394
{\an1}You're either on the top block
or you're in the bottom.

35:46.477 --> 35:48.521
- Well, the coaches are
deliberating right now,

35:48.604 --> 35:49.897
and they have to choose one
of these artists

35:49.981 --> 35:52.692

35:52.775 --> 35:54.360
I can't wait to
see how that shakes out.

35:56.821 --> 35:57.905

going to the bottom.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.575
- Dude, my tattoo is much
cleaner than yours.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.076
Technically way cleaner.
- Six tentacles.

36:59.258 --> 37:01.510
Guys, why did you vote
Daniel to the bottom?

37:01.594 --> 37:03.471
- It's always been an issue
of application.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.973
And I'll be honest,
we really debated it.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.350
Because if it wasn't
for the trauma,

37:07.433 --> 37:08.893
this wouldn't be my bottom.

37:08.976 --> 37:10.478
- Adapting to the skin was
rough, and I honestly believe

37:10.561 --> 37:13.105
{\an3}if anyone was stuck with this
canvas in this area,

37:13.189 --> 37:16.150
{\an3}they would have the same,
exact issue.

37:16.233 --> 37:18.319
- There is a way to do a
better tattoo than this one

37:18.402 --> 37:19.654
no matter what the skin is.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.615
The key ingredient that's
missing is experience.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.575
- I've only had two years'
experience, where it's like,

37:24.659 --> 37:27.662
{\an3}I've been waiting for Jeremy.
At 15 years' experience,

37:31.123 --> 37:33.250
{\an3}you know? I'm waiting for it,
and I haven't seen it.

37:33.334 --> 37:37.296
- I gave a really clean,
solid tattoo. His is just beat.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.174
How does a beat tattoo beat
a technically sound tattoo?

- Technically, this thing
is beautiful.

The reason you're down here

the second I have
to ask a question,

37:53.980 --> 37:55.815
it's not good for
who I'm talking to.

37:55.898 --> 37:57.191
Make your intention clear.

37:57.274 --> 37:58.526
- His technical ability's
always on point.

37:58.609 --> 38:01.070
I don't feel Jeremy did
the worst tattoo of the day.

38:01.153 --> 38:02.697
- Jeremy's tattoos
are [bleep] stale.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.157
He has the same issues
every week, and he's not

38:05.241 --> 38:06.283
learning from his mistakes.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.451
- There's a lot he's saying,

38:07.535 --> 38:08.911
but he still can't pull
a straight line.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.204
He still can't pull a
parallel line on the snakes.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.373
- No, that's not true.
I haven't been--

38:12.456 --> 38:14.959
- It was all wobbly.
Where's his fundamentals?

38:15.042 --> 38:16.335
Where's his
technical application?

38:16.419 --> 38:18.838
- Your snakes don't
pull off as snakes.

38:18.921 --> 38:20.423
- Once I got the face in there

38:20.506 --> 38:22.466
<i>and then seeing the size it</i>
<i>was gonna have to be,</i>

38:22.550 --> 38:24.802
my main concern was
that I was gonna

38:24.885 --> 38:25.886
get to the snakes
and run out of time.

38:25.970 --> 38:29.098
It has its flaws, but
it's appealing.

38:30.391 --> 38:33.310
- Judges, it's time to
determine who's going home.

38:33.394 --> 38:34.895
Jason, to me, is safe.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.772
I understand his technical
issues with it,

38:36.856 --> 38:37.898
but it's a
[bleep] bad-ass face.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.192
- I agree with that.
We're really nitpicking,

38:40.276 --> 38:42.069
and we're getting into
everybody's work

38:42.153 --> 38:43.154
with a fine-tooth comb.

38:43.237 --> 38:45.239
So, when we get into
Daniel's tattoo,

38:45.322 --> 38:48.451
he drew out a bad-ass piece,
but here's these cuts.

38:48.534 --> 38:51.078
- I see Daniel's canvas,
the skin was [bleep]ed.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.872
And Daniel doesn't even
do this style.

38:52.955 --> 38:53.831
But he's progressed so much
in this competition

38:53.914 --> 38:56.083
that he did this.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.585
Nobody in this room
could've done that tattoo

38:57.668 --> 38:58.794
in two and a half years.

38:58.878 --> 39:01.422
- I'm torn, because
on technical application,

39:01.505 --> 39:03.424
Jeremy wins this.
But it is one of the more

39:03.507 --> 39:05.259
confusing things to look at.

39:05.342 --> 39:08.846
Daniel's is applied roughly,
but I know exactly what it is.

39:08.929 --> 39:10.681
- Different people could've
gotten different canvases,

39:10.765 --> 39:12.141
and it could've gone a totally
different way,

39:12.224 --> 39:14.935
but for me, it's Daniel.

39:15.019 --> 39:17.188
- My vote's for Daniel.

39:17.271 --> 39:18.731

Daniel, you do not have
