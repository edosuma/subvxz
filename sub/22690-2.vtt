WEBVTT

00:15.348 --> 00:18.476
-[Frank Jr.] Come on, Dad. Do it.
-[Frank] All right, all right, all right.

00:19.269 --> 00:21.729
Once upon a time,
in the middle of the night,

00:21.813 --> 00:24.399
two dead men, they got up to fight.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.193
Back-to-back, they faced each other,

00:26.276 --> 00:29.071
they drew their swords
and they shot each other.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.823
-[chuckles]
-Stupid.

00:31.906 --> 00:34.367
What do you mean, "stupid"?
It's not stupid, it's nonsense.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.620
-Nonsense is different from stupid.
-Yeah, then it's stupid nonsense.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.747
Stop that.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.000
Hey, Lis, do the second verse.
Show him how it's done.

00:43.084 --> 00:47.380
One was blind and the other couldn't see,
so they chose a dumb man for a referee.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.800
The blind man went to see fair play,
and the dumb man went to shout, "Hooray!"

00:50.883 --> 00:51.884
-Oh!
-[chuckles]

00:51.968 --> 00:53.219
Attagirl.

00:53.678 --> 00:57.974
See, before smartphones and all that
Internet crap, this is how people got by.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.435
-So boring.
-It's not boring.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.395
Hey...

01:02.479 --> 01:04.814
[Lisa gasps] Look! There it is!

01:12.739 --> 01:15.908
I read at school that she represents
everything good about America.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.327
[Frank] That's about right.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.537
Is that why you have to go and fight?

01:19.621 --> 01:22.165
Dad goes away
so he can kill lots of hajjis.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.000
-How many have you wasted anyway, Dad?
-Hey!

01:24.083 --> 01:26.169
Don't you ever say that again.
You got that?

01:26.252 --> 01:27.420
Do you got it?

02:09.086 --> 02:11.088
Yeah, that's good. I appreciate it.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.604
[Frank] Ma'am, excuse me, but, um...

02:27.189 --> 02:28.648
just get a little bit of that coffee?

02:34.111 --> 02:36.198
Thank you. No, no. Just, uh...

02:36.281 --> 02:39.242
three eggs, over easy,
some bacon, sourdough toast, yeah?

02:39.325 --> 02:40.910
[woman]
You moving into the neighborhood?

02:42.412 --> 02:45.122
-Depends on the eggs.
-We don't get many hipsters around here.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.375
-Yeah, well, you still don't, lady.
-Mm-hmm.

02:48.626 --> 02:53.172
I need, uh, three eggs over easy,
side of bacon and some sourdough toast.

03:06.478 --> 03:07.937
[phone ringing]

03:11.065 --> 03:12.066
Yeah?

03:13.651 --> 03:16.112
Hipster! It's for you.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.198
-That can't be.
-[woman] I'm telling you.

03:19.282 --> 03:22.285
This guy just described you
like he was standing beside me.

03:39.135 --> 03:41.554
-Don't be all day on there.
-Yeah.

03:46.393 --> 03:49.604
-You got the wrong guy.
-[man]  Yeah, I don't think so.

03:50.187 --> 03:52.607
Unless I'm not talking to Frank Castle?

03:53.816 --> 03:56.486
You know, let's not waste time.
You're Frank Castle, right?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.738
Frank Castle, the dead man?

04:02.575 --> 04:05.828
-Makes two of us now.
-You're more right than you know.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.998
You're not the only ghost
in this town, Frank.

04:09.081 --> 04:12.669
Hey, did you ever get that disk
that I left for you at your house?

04:14.211 --> 04:16.631
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.132
Did you watch it?

04:18.215 --> 04:22.219
"Micro." What is that?
Is that... Is that some sort of name?

04:22.303 --> 04:23.763
Sure. That'll do for now.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.100
You got something you want
to discuss with me, why don't you...

04:27.475 --> 04:29.352
Why don't you come on down here, huh?

04:30.312 --> 04:33.022
Buy you a cup of coffee, talk about it.

04:33.105 --> 04:35.232
You know,
I don't think that would end so well.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.234
You need to understand first.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.904
You need to really know
why you can't kill me.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.033
-Then we can meet.
-[line disconnects]

04:50.540 --> 04:51.624
Delicious.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.060
[Frank panting]

05:11.143 --> 05:12.186
[dog barking]

05:14.522 --> 05:15.940
[panting]

05:18.067 --> 05:19.235
[man] Hey!

05:42.592 --> 05:44.301
[breathing heavily]

06:46.155 --> 06:47.240
Shit.

06:49.241 --> 06:51.243
[theme music playing]

08:03.149 --> 08:04.526
[Maria] Mmm.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.032
Hey.

08:12.324 --> 08:13.660
What time is it?

08:13.743 --> 08:14.744
No!

08:14.827 --> 08:16.412
[breathes heavily]

08:24.170 --> 08:25.171
[grunts]

08:31.553 --> 08:33.054
[breathing heavily]

08:44.816 --> 08:46.568
[Ahmad panting]

08:46.651 --> 08:48.110
[interrogator speaking Pashto]

08:49.779 --> 08:50.780
[Ahmad grunts]

09:03.585 --> 09:06.295
-[soldier in English]  What's he saying?
-[interrogator]  Nothing useful.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.631
[soldier]  We sure he's got anything?

09:08.715 --> 09:10.800
[interrogator]
You questioning my intelligence, soldier?

09:10.883 --> 09:13.177
Please, I'm not a terrorist.

09:13.260 --> 09:16.097
I have a family, children, I have--
[panting]

09:19.976 --> 09:22.604
[interrogator speaking Pashto]

09:30.903 --> 09:31.904
[soldier in English]  Do it.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.910
[grunts]

09:41.122 --> 09:42.123
[glass shatters]

10:04.103 --> 10:05.354
Morning, Frank.

10:07.356 --> 10:08.650
So what brings you here?

10:10.401 --> 10:13.821
Curt... there's somebody
who's coming after me.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.447
Somebody knows I'm alive.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.409
He calls himself Micro.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.204
-You wanna know if he got it from me?
-Look, it's a short list.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.873
-I'm not saying--
-Come on, Frank.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.583
-I would never give you up.
-I know that. I just...

10:26.668 --> 10:31.673
Anything. Did something slip?
Anybody... hanging out, anything slide?

10:31.756 --> 10:34.466
-Anything?
-No, nothing. Not a peep.

10:37.762 --> 10:38.971
What does he want?

10:39.931 --> 10:41.891
Guy says he's got answers that I need.

10:43.768 --> 10:44.769
Schoonover...

10:45.269 --> 10:47.897
you know, when I put him down,
he said something to me.

10:49.607 --> 10:50.983
He said that what...

10:51.608 --> 10:54.195
He said that what happened
to Maria and the kids,

10:54.278 --> 10:56.489
it was because of something that I did.

10:56.781 --> 11:00.076
Something... something I did in Kandahar.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.243
Schoonover...

11:01.744 --> 11:03.663
Dirty bastard would've said anything
to stay alive.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.331
Doesn't mean it's not true.

11:06.248 --> 11:08.334
Come on, talk to me. What were you into?

11:11.754 --> 11:12.755
[muttering]

11:15.132 --> 11:16.342
Yeah...

11:17.009 --> 11:18.344
[muttering]

11:20.596 --> 11:24.308
There was a group of us.
We got sheep dipped to CIA.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.267
It was...

11:25.351 --> 11:28.395
interrogation and assassination. It was...

11:28.479 --> 11:29.688
It wasn't war.

11:30.606 --> 11:31.733
Not like we knew it.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.945
Truth is, Curt... I was past caring.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.365
That shit follows you home
no matter how hard you try,

11:39.448 --> 11:41.700
it follows you home,
and Maria, she knew it.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.577
She knew it. The kids knew it, the...

11:44.578 --> 11:46.455
Sometimes I'd catch 'em, they...

11:46.873 --> 11:49.291
They'd be looking at me
and they'd have this look.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.753
Look at me like
they didn't even know who I was.

11:53.587 --> 11:54.839
Come on, Frank.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.924
Come on, you...
you didn't kill your family.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.175
What if I did?

12:08.394 --> 12:10.479
It keeps hitting me, being back here.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.608
All the big stuff we take for granted
and don't even think about,

12:14.691 --> 12:16.944
but we obsess on things that don't matter.

12:17.027 --> 12:21.282
Think about what happened here on 9/11.
People bounce back so damn quick.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.952
-We let ourselves forget.
-We choose to forget.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.496
Easiest thing for me now
would be to forget Ahmad Zubair

12:27.579 --> 12:28.956
and what happened in Afghanistan.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.586
Why do you think Zubair was killed
by our people?

12:35.712 --> 12:38.424
I was sent a video file of his murder
by an anonymous source.

12:38.507 --> 12:41.468
He was interrogated
and shot in the head by Americans

12:41.552 --> 12:43.137
'cause they knew he was a cop.

12:43.721 --> 12:44.555
Holy shit.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.851
-Why haven't you shown Wolf the video?
-Because I don't have it.

12:49.768 --> 12:50.978
It was stolen in Kandahar.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.022
So, Schoonover and Castle
were on this tape?

12:53.606 --> 12:54.815
They all wore masks.

12:55.942 --> 12:59.403
All right, look, say it was them.
All your suspects are dead.

12:59.486 --> 13:01.572
Then who stole the tape?
And why am I back here?

13:01.655 --> 13:03.991
There were seven men
in the room with Zubair.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.409
Wolf knows about this?

13:05.492 --> 13:07.453
Well, why request me
and then treat me like shit?

13:07.536 --> 13:10.331
I think he's been told specifically
to keep me away from it.

13:12.249 --> 13:15.377
I found a guy from Castle
and Schoonover's old unit in the city.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.172
Guy called Billy Russo.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.425
Wolf's never gonna let you talk to him.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.302
We'll see about that.

13:31.518 --> 13:34.355
[Wolf] Okay, that's it.
I look forward to reading the report.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.443
Sir?

13:40.652 --> 13:41.863
Madani. How can I help you?

13:41.946 --> 13:43.739
Sir, I was going through
the deployment reports

13:43.822 --> 13:46.117
and special response protocols.
You got a great team here.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.702
You were in the field plenty yourself
as I understand it.

13:48.785 --> 13:51.163
I was always happy being the first one
through the door.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.374
The problem with rank is
they don't let you do that anymore.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.875
Of course.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.879
It'd be great for me to get
some physical training with the unit.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.214
You expect me to sign off
on sending my team to Brunswick

14:00.297 --> 14:02.884
on a getting-to-know-you exercise
purely for your benefit?

14:03.675 --> 14:04.718
Absolutely not.

14:04.801 --> 14:07.179
I thought we could organize
something up here in New York,

14:07.263 --> 14:09.056
via a private contractor.

14:09.140 --> 14:12.101
There's a company, Anvil,
that have all the facilities we'd need.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.686
I want you to be confident
that you can trust me

14:14.770 --> 14:16.022
if I'm the first through the door.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.399
What the hell, why not?

14:18.482 --> 14:20.776
Send me a proposal later
and I'll take a look at it.

14:20.985 --> 14:21.861
Thank you, sir.

14:29.827 --> 14:33.831
[Frank] Say, lady. I'm real hungry.
You got any change? Please?

14:37.626 --> 14:38.835
Thanks, Karen.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.635
You're still all heart, huh?

14:51.682 --> 14:53.059
Things got this bad, Frank?

14:54.018 --> 14:57.313
Wanted to say hello.
I thought I'd try my luck out here

14:57.396 --> 14:59.273
-and not get my head blown off.
-[scoffs]

15:00.607 --> 15:03.652
-You still got that hand cannon?
-You better believe it.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.823
-Attagirl.
-What the hell are you doing here?

15:09.325 --> 15:10.910
Can we talk?

15:13.620 --> 15:15.081
[door unlocks]

15:18.542 --> 15:19.626
[door closes]

15:25.841 --> 15:27.176
[Karen sighs]

15:30.096 --> 15:31.097
Drink?

15:34.475 --> 15:35.601
Sure.

15:42.233 --> 15:45.361
-I wasn't sure if you'd still talk to me.
-I wasn't either.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.660
You look well.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.874
Rocking the whole, uh... hipster thing.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.877
Been flirting with the idea
of going full man-bun.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.171
You, uh, think I could pull that off?

16:07.299 --> 16:08.342
Where have you been?

16:11.303 --> 16:12.846
[sighs] I had business, Karen.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.557
I had to finish.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.977
And you finished it?

16:32.699 --> 16:34.410
Look, Karen, there's, uh...

16:35.452 --> 16:37.204
there's somebody that knows
I'm still alive.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.542
-I need to know if you said anything.
-God, no.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.462
No, Frank, you should know me
better than that. I would never...

16:45.546 --> 16:47.840
You want to say no, you say no, but...

16:49.675 --> 16:51.343
I could really use your help.

16:54.846 --> 16:56.515
You want me to help you find them?

16:58.809 --> 16:59.893
I do.

17:00.686 --> 17:04.273
Look, this guy calls himself Micro, right?
Like that's supposed to mean something.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.068
He's been watching me.
I think he's some kind of spook

17:07.151 --> 17:09.778
and he's gotta be a good one,
'cause I didn't see him coming.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.364
And all you got's a name?

17:12.448 --> 17:15.117
He said something about
us both being dead men, right?

17:15.201 --> 17:18.745
About... me not being
the only ghost in New York.

17:20.747 --> 17:22.083
How do I contact you?

17:32.634 --> 17:35.554
-You bought me flowers?
-Yeah.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.308
I'm an old-fashioned kinda guy.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.478
I was thinking if you had something,
you could put the flowers in the window.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.480
I'll call you.

17:46.648 --> 17:47.524
Okay.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.736
-Okay.
-Okay.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.074
Thanks, Karen.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.872
Thanks for the beer. You know, hey--

18:15.177 --> 18:18.388
-Just really good to see you.
-Mmm. It's good to see you.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.394
[Frank] Be careful.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.109
[door opens]

18:33.904 --> 18:37.073
Okay. Uh, yeah, these can
go back downstairs, but wait...

18:38.408 --> 18:39.701
Uh... okay.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.995
All that can go downstairs now, thanks.

18:42.954 --> 18:43.955
[Ellison] Hey.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.208
-Good, you're here.
-Dare I ask?

18:46.292 --> 18:49.044
Well, our system has an entry
for an unpublished article

18:49.128 --> 18:52.298
from a year or so ago, but I can't find
the actual report on the system.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.342
The only other mention I could find
is a website, but that's not working.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.928
-And what was the article about?
-Computer hacker.

18:58.011 --> 19:01.014
Hey, would the name Micro
ring any bells for you?

19:01.097 --> 19:03.642
A government agent maybe,
but I'm not really sure.

19:04.351 --> 19:07.563
Where is this, um...
Where's this story coming from?

19:07.646 --> 19:09.648
A source I trust.
He gave me a name, told me to dig.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.067
-And, uh, who... who is this source?
-It's a source.

19:13.277 --> 19:16.488
-Tell you if it turns into anything.
-Ah, well, um...

19:17.281 --> 19:18.574
there... there was a story,

19:18.657 --> 19:21.993
brought in a while back by a stringer,
a real seat-of-your-pants radical.

19:22.077 --> 19:25.080
[stammers] Just paranoid.
Saw conspiracies in everything.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.124
But supposedly
he had a lead on an NSA analyst

19:28.209 --> 19:30.586
who was leaking secrets
who went by the name of Micro.

19:30.669 --> 19:31.712
And?

19:33.672 --> 19:35.424
And I decided not to run it.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.843
-Because?
-'Cause I'm an editor. It's what I do.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.135
-Part of the job description.
-No.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.597
No, Ellison, don't get sarcastic with me.
I know that play.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.308
-Why?
-Well, he had no evidence, Karen.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.519
[stutters] I mean, his only source
was this guy from Homeland

19:47.603 --> 19:49.521
who refused to go on record.

19:49.605 --> 19:54.067
[sighs] And then... special agent
in charge for New York, Carson Wolf,

19:54.150 --> 19:57.404
stopped by personally
and asked me not to pursue it.

19:57.488 --> 19:58.822
So then the story is true?

19:58.905 --> 20:03.076
According to him, if we ran the story,
it would interfere with his investigation.

20:03.159 --> 20:05.871
He was afraid we'd screw up his chances
of catching everybody.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.999
-And you agreed with that?
-I decided to wait for the bigger story.

20:09.082 --> 20:12.836
-And make a friend of Carson Wolf.
-Oh, my God. Ellison...

20:14.213 --> 20:15.255
All right, look...

20:15.922 --> 20:20.261
I'm sure that I still have that article
in my office...

20:21.136 --> 20:24.765
so if I give it to you,
will you stop looking at me like that?

20:25.849 --> 20:26.683
[exhales]

20:45.952 --> 20:47.538
[beeping]

20:49.581 --> 20:51.207
[typing]

20:51.292 --> 20:55.170
[Sarah]  But I don't care if Jason's mom
said he could go. You're not going, Zach.

20:55.837 --> 20:59.174
-[Zach]  I already said I could go.
-[Sarah scoffs]  Yeah, before you asked me.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.926
[Zach]  Because I thought it would be okay.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.469
[Leo]  That was your first mistake.

21:02.553 --> 21:03.929
[Zach]  No one asked for your opinion.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.014
[Sarah]  No one obviously asked me
for mine, either.

21:06.097 --> 21:08.642
[Zach]  It's just a movie.
Dad would have totally let me go.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.185
[Sarah]  When? When you were ten?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.271
Because your father
hasn't been here for a year,

21:12.354 --> 21:16.358
which sucks for all of us,
but his memory isn't some bargaining chip

21:16.442 --> 21:19.027
that you can just throw out there
in an argument. You understand?

21:19.110 --> 21:20.404
I'm sorry, Mom.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.365
-He didn't mean it like that.
-[stutters]  Hey, Zach!

21:24.074 --> 21:26.743
Zach, get back here. Come here.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.746
I get it. Maybe it is just a movie.
Maybe it is no big deal.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.459
But I need to know what's going on
with all of us, or I can't...  [stutters]

21:35.377 --> 21:36.628
I just need to know, okay?

21:38.380 --> 21:40.256
Control freakery is a coping mechanism.

21:40.341 --> 21:41.633
-[Sarah chuckles]
-I get that.

21:41.717 --> 21:42.884
[Sarah]  Yeah, maybe it is.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.970
You know who I learned it from?
Your father.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.181
[Leo]  It is just a movie, Mom.

21:49.140 --> 21:50.934
-[Zach]  Please?
-[Sarah]  I'll think about it.

21:51.017 --> 21:53.562
-When are you gonna think about it--
-Just... Hey!

21:53.645 --> 21:55.814
Quit while you're ahead, little brother.

21:57.941 --> 21:59.443
I love you, Mom.

21:59.901 --> 22:02.278
Oh, baby. I love you.

22:04.197 --> 22:06.325
[sighs] Me too, little bunny.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.676
-Are you finished with your math test?
-Yeah.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.673
-[device explodes]
-[man groaning]

23:04.174 --> 23:06.593
-[guns firing]
-[men grunting]

23:14.643 --> 23:15.936
[screams]

23:16.019 --> 23:19.022
-[man] Please, don't shoot! Don't shoot!
-[Dinah] It's a hostage.

23:19.105 --> 23:20.356
[grunts]

23:21.442 --> 23:23.902
-[alarm sounding]
-[Sam] God damn it.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.782
[sighs] I saw the guy
coming at me and I just...

23:28.865 --> 23:31.577
I figured he was a hostile. [sighs]

23:31.660 --> 23:32.744
[Dinah] Shh.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.914
-[Sam sighs]
-Don't beat yourself up.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.542
If we got out of a situation like this
with only one hostage dead,

23:38.625 --> 23:41.503
-it'd be a win. It's never this clean.
-[man] Very true.

23:42.212 --> 23:44.255
The real thing is always messier.

23:44.339 --> 23:48.051
-I'm Billy Russo.
-Dinah Madani. Sam Stein.

23:48.134 --> 23:50.261
-This your operation?
-Yes, it is.

23:50.345 --> 23:54.099
We rent a different space every time
and they're a little rough and ready,

23:54.182 --> 23:56.518
-but it keeps people on their toes.
-Well, it worked great.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.979
Sam, you did everything right.

23:59.062 --> 24:02.148
You can't legislate for that
one terrified hostage who doesn't listen.

24:02.232 --> 24:05.902
Once somebody says go,
it's all just a percentages game.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.446
I'll keep that in mind.

24:09.573 --> 24:10.657
Please.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.911
Anvil would be happy
to give your people more training.

24:15.411 --> 24:17.539
-Thanks.
-There's none better.

24:17.623 --> 24:21.084
All my operators and instructors
are former Special Forces.

24:21.167 --> 24:25.255
A government contract here,
on US soil, would be a big deal for us.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.340
Where are your guys now?

24:27.423 --> 24:29.593
-Iraq and Afghanistan, mostly.
-Ah.

24:29.676 --> 24:32.554
Close protection work.
Convoy security, that kind of thing.

24:32.638 --> 24:33.680
We do good work.

24:33.764 --> 24:36.600
-We're growing fast.
-I just got back from Afghanistan.

24:36.683 --> 24:39.102
I was the Homeland Security attaché
over there.

24:39.185 --> 24:41.730
Madani. So, you're what, Persian?

24:41.813 --> 24:46.943
American. I was born here.
But, yeah, my folks came over in '79.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.946
Can't have been easy...
doing your job out there.

24:50.030 --> 24:53.575
The rules are simpler in many ways.
You know what they are, at least.

24:53.658 --> 24:54.618
Sure.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.828
Afghanistan's the simplest place
in the world,

24:56.912 --> 24:58.539
once you stop trying to change it.

24:59.497 --> 25:01.291
My last tour before I went private.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.919
Ah. Uh, what unit?

25:04.002 --> 25:05.962
Interrogating the help, Madani?

25:06.922 --> 25:08.256
Sir, I didn't know you were here.

25:08.339 --> 25:11.092
Mr. Russo, Carson Wolf.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.970
-Impressive setup you have here.
-I'm glad you approve.

25:14.470 --> 25:16.139
If you want to come by
the corporate office,

25:16.222 --> 25:17.933
I'd be happy to discuss
tailoring a program--

25:18.016 --> 25:19.350
Talk to procurement.

25:20.518 --> 25:23.188
Kandahar's in your rearview.
Don't forget that.

25:23.271 --> 25:25.566
Yes, sir. Just making conversation.

25:33.865 --> 25:37.243
I assume you can talk
about whatever you like off-duty?

25:38.745 --> 25:39.830
Over a drink?

26:11.278 --> 26:13.154
I wanna know what you're gonna do...

26:14.030 --> 26:15.281
if you find Micro.

26:16.616 --> 26:17.617
You found him?

26:20.078 --> 26:23.039
I found something.
Makes sense with what you told me.

26:24.457 --> 26:27.377
-Who is it?
-Look, I gotta be real clear here.

26:28.336 --> 26:30.463
I wanna help,
but not if it's gonna get someone killed.

26:30.546 --> 26:33.884
Hey, look, I didn't go looking
for this guy, all right? He came to me.

26:33.967 --> 26:35.844
For all I know,
this guy has something to do

26:35.927 --> 26:38.513
with what happened to my family.
So what do you want?

26:38.596 --> 26:40.431
If this guy isn't dirty,
if he's not dangerous,

26:40.515 --> 26:42.225
he's got nothing to worry about from me.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.019
Please, just...

26:44.853 --> 26:46.980
-just help me, Karen. Help me.
-[sighs]

26:47.063 --> 26:49.440
You know what? Or don't, all right?
Leave my ass in the wind

26:49.524 --> 26:52.402
if that's what you gotta do.
Just do it, all right? For Christ's sake.

26:52.736 --> 26:53.945
[sighs]

27:01.036 --> 27:02.162
What is this?

27:03.538 --> 27:05.373
It's an unconfirmed story... [sighs]

27:05.456 --> 27:08.669
...about an intelligence operative that
got caught leaking covert information.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.172
-Called himself Micro.
-Micro?

27:13.089 --> 27:14.507
You got a name?

27:14.841 --> 27:16.259
David Lieberman.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.262
And here's the kicker. Officially...

27:19.345 --> 27:23.224
Lieberman was shot and killed trying
to escape arrest by Homeland Security.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.268
I know, he said that.
He said that he was a ghost.

27:25.351 --> 27:26.352
-He said that.
-Yeah.

27:26.936 --> 27:28.396
How come I couldn't find this?

27:28.479 --> 27:30.273
-Well, the story never ran.
-Why?

27:30.356 --> 27:33.318
Because that guy,
Carson Wolf, got it shut down.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.278
You know what?
It's all in the story, Frank.

27:35.361 --> 27:36.947
Just read it.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.075
Hey, can I be honest with you?
This guy, he's...

27:41.076 --> 27:44.245
-he's scaring the shit out of me.
-What's he got on you anyway, huh?

27:46.581 --> 27:47.582
Nothing.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.001
Right.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.421
-Thanks for this.
-Yeah.

27:56.717 --> 27:58.009
Hey, when am I gonna see you?

28:00.679 --> 28:01.721
You want to?

28:03.932 --> 28:06.351
It'd mean you're still alive. [scoffs]

28:07.435 --> 28:10.063
Believe it or not,
I actually care what happens to you...

28:10.146 --> 28:12.023
which makes precisely one of us.

28:16.778 --> 28:17.821
Just, uh...

28:21.241 --> 28:22.117
be careful.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.217
[pop song playing over speakers]

28:43.221 --> 28:44.264
[tires screech]

28:44.347 --> 28:46.432
-[Sarah gasps] Oh, my God.
-[Frank grunts]

28:47.017 --> 28:48.810
-Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
-[groans]

28:48.894 --> 28:50.854
[stutters] I didn't even see you.

28:56.777 --> 28:58.945
-Stay down. Stay down, um...
-[groaning] Okay. Yeah.

28:59.029 --> 29:01.364
-I'm gonna call the paramedics.
-No, no, no. It's all right.

29:01.447 --> 29:03.867
Sir, I really think you should stay down.
Just wait for help.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.451
Yeah, no, look, there's nothing broken.

29:05.535 --> 29:07.954
-I think we both got lucky, you know.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

29:11.332 --> 29:14.294
Kinda came out of there.
I didn't give you much of a chance, so...

29:14.377 --> 29:15.378
Your head is bleeding.

29:16.337 --> 29:18.214
No, no, no, no, no.

29:22.052 --> 29:24.012
No. Where are you going, Sarah?

29:29.642 --> 29:30.685
No!

29:30.769 --> 29:32.896
No, no, no, Castle, you asshole.

29:34.689 --> 29:37.608
Shit. [sighs]

29:46.409 --> 29:47.828
[engine starts]

29:52.248 --> 29:53.541
[grunts softly]

29:53.624 --> 29:55.001
[cell phone vibrating]

29:58.463 --> 29:59.380
[scoffs]

30:08.098 --> 30:09.891
Thanks for that. As good as new.

30:09.975 --> 30:13.478
-Um, I was making myself a pot. So--
-Wow. Uh, you didn't have to do that.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.355
-Oh, please... [chuckles]
-Thank you.

30:15.438 --> 30:19.109
It's the least I could do after
spilling yours all over my windshield.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.902
I'm fine, I tell you. It's...

30:21.862 --> 30:25.406
-It's good. I'm, uh...
-[sighs] It's a mess.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.575
I'm Pete, by the way. Castiglione.

30:27.658 --> 30:29.911
-Uh, Sarah. Lieberman.
-Pleasure.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.832
You got a good-looking family, Sarah.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.667
Thank you.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.710
What line of work's your husband in?

30:38.503 --> 30:40.005
Uh, he works for the government.

30:40.588 --> 30:43.049
He, um... he actually passed away.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.510
A year ago.

30:46.887 --> 30:47.929
-[sighs]
-Sorry to hear that.

30:48.013 --> 30:51.432
[stammers] Yeah. I'm sorry.
I don't know why I was gonna lie.

30:52.683 --> 30:54.269
[Sarah sighs]

30:54.352 --> 30:56.146
You know, I get it. Uh...

30:57.230 --> 31:00.483
Must be difficult. You got a strange man
in the house and he's not...

31:01.567 --> 31:03.694
I'll take off, all right?
I'll just set this coffee--

31:03.778 --> 31:05.738
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay. Please, sorry.

31:05.821 --> 31:07.615
Um... finish your coffee.

31:08.616 --> 31:09.576
Okay.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.546
I'm sorry about your loss, Sarah.

31:23.965 --> 31:24.966
[sniffles]

31:27.760 --> 31:29.721
Oh. Uh...

31:30.055 --> 31:34.475
I'm sorry, it's just the...
the whole knocking you down and...

31:35.601 --> 31:38.438
I mean, you think...
you think you're okay and then...

31:38.521 --> 31:40.356
[sighs]
...something just brings it all back.

31:40.773 --> 31:41.733
Yeah.

31:42.067 --> 31:46.029
Uh, I didn't mean to ambush you
with the whole dead husband thing.

31:46.112 --> 31:49.532
It's just, you know, new people, do I lie?

31:50.491 --> 31:53.494
But then that feels so disloyal
to his memories.

31:54.787 --> 31:57.958
You must think I'm crazy.
Knocking you down and then--

31:58.041 --> 32:00.626
No, no. Hey, hey.
I don't, uh... Not at all.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.004
-Sarah, you know, I, uh...
-[sighs]

You know, that you're still here
and they're not.

Your husband, was he, uh... Was he ill?

32:24.275 --> 32:26.652
[clears throat] Uh, no. Um, David...

32:27.903 --> 32:31.157
David died doing something very brave...

32:32.575 --> 32:33.784
and really stupid.

32:35.286 --> 32:38.539
On my good days, you know,
I'm proud of him for what he did.

32:39.499 --> 32:43.794
And on my bad ones, I just wanna
scream in his face for being so selfish.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.423
Honestly, if he walked
through that door right now,

32:47.507 --> 32:49.550
I don't know if I would kiss him
or slap him.

41:33.783 --> 41:37.036
What're you saying?
You killed my family to get to me?

Misdirection.

enough dead bodies,

nobody would really care to look
close enough at any given one of 'em.

This is where I bring a girl
when she's gonna see through all that.

[chuckles] I can't decide
whether that's a compliment or not.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.148
Are you the kind of woman
that takes offense at those?

42:48.232 --> 42:49.692

42:50.359 --> 42:52.527
The last time I saw glasses this dirty,

42:52.612 --> 42:56.741
I was in the NCO's mess at Bagram,
saying my farewells to Afghanistan.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.158
Sounds like you miss it.

42:58.742 --> 43:02.162

-There's no end to anything there.

43:02.246 --> 43:05.249
Afghans have been fighting invaders
for a thousand years.

For us, it's a mission.
For them, it's just... life.

43:09.044 --> 43:11.130
I finished my last tour
and I knew I couldn't go back.

43:11.213 --> 43:13.090
Not in uniform, anyway.

43:13.924 --> 43:15.718
You never said who you were with.

43:19.096 --> 43:21.807
Why do I get the feeling
that if I name the right unit,

you're suddenly gonna get
a lot more interested?

who's paying me compliments.

43:37.322 --> 43:40.117
Am I a suspect for something?

43:40.200 --> 43:41.535
Not according to your discharge records.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.913
Is that why you came to Anvil
for training?

43:43.996 --> 43:46.957
You figure I can help you
with this unfinished business of yours?

43:47.917 --> 43:49.126
I hope so, yeah.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.295
Excuse me.

43:54.339 --> 43:56.967
Well, I'm not about to throw shade
on my friends.

43:57.051 --> 43:59.261
In all due respect, Dinah, you're a cop.

44:00.721 --> 44:04.016
Soldiers can't question
legality or morality in the moment.

44:04.099 --> 44:05.392
That's a way to get yourself killed.

44:09.229 --> 44:11.982
[chuckles] Ask your questions.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.611
-You served with Frank Castle.
-[sighs]

44:16.696 --> 44:19.198
Yeah, Frank Castle was my best buddy.

44:20.700 --> 44:22.827
I guess that wasn't in my file, huh?

44:24.370 --> 44:26.580
A lot of those kills I got in one night...

44:27.331 --> 44:31.043
side by side with the guy, holed up
in a house in Basra with no backup.

44:31.960 --> 44:34.046
We spent the night trying not to die.

44:34.546 --> 44:36.924
One of the best nights of my life,
if I'm honest.

44:37.007 --> 44:39.426
It was just them or us. Who was better?

44:40.594 --> 44:42.054
There was nobody better than Frank.

44:46.141 --> 44:47.643
I'm sorry that he's dead.

44:49.103 --> 44:50.687
He took a lot of people with him.

44:50.771 --> 44:54.149
What? Drug dealers? Gangsters? Good.

44:54.233 --> 44:57.402
You shipped out. Castle didn't.
Did he get dirty?

44:57.486 --> 44:59.696
Stay in any war long enough,
it'll get dirty.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.366
Unless you've got something good
to hold onto.

45:02.449 --> 45:03.784
Frank had that taken away.

45:03.868 --> 45:05.452
Could he have been involved
in drugs there?

45:05.535 --> 45:06.703
[chuckles]

45:08.080 --> 45:11.500
If you knew the man,
you would know how dumb that question is.

45:11.583 --> 45:15.004
I think that the system let Frank down
in a big way.

45:15.587 --> 45:17.172
So he did what he was trained to do.

45:17.256 --> 45:19.674
So if someone killed your family,
you'd do the same?

45:19.759 --> 45:21.176
Well, I don't have one.

45:22.219 --> 45:24.054
I like to travel light. What about you?

45:26.556 --> 45:28.350
I think some of us
get to have the family life

45:28.433 --> 45:29.977
and some of us get to protect it.

45:30.895 --> 45:33.773
So... you're single.

45:35.775 --> 45:36.942
[chuckles]

45:39.403 --> 45:42.823
Uh... not worried
that'll get kind of lonely?

45:44.158 --> 45:45.367
I'm not lonely.

45:47.870 --> 45:48.704
Are you?

45:49.872 --> 45:51.081
Not right now.

46:02.676 --> 46:05.637

46:07.472 --> 46:09.308
Yeah. I'd like that.

Okay. I'm not judging.

a fun way to go... at all.

Any good?

-[stuttering]  You know, uh, I...

47:49.116 --> 47:50.825
I gave you this phone
so I could contact you.

47:50.910 --> 47:51.994
You understand that, right?

47:52.077 --> 47:55.080
I know why you gave it to me,
but I wasn't gonna leave it on.

47:55.164 --> 47:58.542
See, thing is, is I, uh,
got a shave, hurt my leg.

47:58.625 --> 47:59.626
Got myself a limp.

47:59.709 --> 48:01.753
I guess it messed up
your gait recognition, huh?

48:01.836 --> 48:05.507
[chuckles] Yeah, I was wondering how long
it was gonna take you to catch on to that.

48:06.091 --> 48:09.636
Only thing I can't figure out
is how you knew which cameras to check.

48:09.719 --> 48:10.930
Oh, that was easy, Frank.

48:11.013 --> 48:13.015
I waited for a bunch of bad guys
to turn up dead

48:13.098 --> 48:14.766
and then I just checked nearby.

48:14.849 --> 48:16.143
Pretty smart, Lieberman.

48:16.226 --> 48:19.563
You know I did you a favor, right?
I wiped those feeds clean after.

48:19.646 --> 48:21.315
Boy, oh, boy. I'm, uh...

48:21.398 --> 48:23.067
-I'm real grateful.
-So, uh...

48:23.150 --> 48:27.404
here we are, couple of smart guys
chewing the fat, huh?

48:27.487 --> 48:29.239
I gotta ask you, why'd you go to my house?

48:31.700 --> 48:33.410
You know something, David?

48:33.953 --> 48:38.165
Your wife, she's, uh...
she's real cut up about your death.

48:38.248 --> 48:39.499
They have nothing to do with this.

48:39.583 --> 48:41.626
Bullshit. You know what?
You're an asshole.

48:42.211 --> 48:43.878
You're a man who put his family in danger

48:43.963 --> 48:45.672
and you didn't do it once,
you did it again.

48:45.755 --> 48:47.257
I'm gonna make that right.

48:48.342 --> 48:50.094
She's only safe if she thinks I'm dead.

48:50.177 --> 48:53.430
You brought this shit on yourself.
You wanted to play Deep Throat, right?

48:53.513 --> 48:54.681
Your buddy, Carson Wolf,

48:54.764 --> 48:57.309
-he told me everything.
-Did you kill him?

48:59.186 --> 49:00.354
It's what you wanted, right?

49:02.022 --> 49:03.232
What did he say?

49:03.315 --> 49:05.525
-You still want to talk?
-Yeah. I do.

49:05.609 --> 49:07.902
-Here's what we're gonna do--
-No, no, you stop talking.

49:07.987 --> 49:11.281
I'm sick of hearing you talk.
I'm calling the shots now.

49:11.365 --> 49:13.117
I'm going offline.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.201
In exactly one hour,

49:14.284 --> 49:16.662
call me with a cell phone number
I can reach you on.

49:16.745 --> 49:18.163
-You got that?
-[line disconnects]

49:26.005 --> 49:27.381
[Frank]  Here's how it works.

49:27.464 --> 49:30.009
I give you a destination
and a time to be there.

49:30.092 --> 49:32.386
If you're late or if I spot tails,
we're done.

49:33.345 --> 49:36.306
Twenty minutes,
under the Pulaski Road Bridge.

49:41.645 --> 49:43.272
[cell phone vibrating]

49:45.524 --> 49:48.985
-Yeah.
-[Frank]  41st Street dock, 20 minutes.

49:56.910 --> 49:58.328
[cell phone vibrating]

50:02.166 --> 50:04.418
[Frank]
Greenpoint Terminal, 20 minutes.

50:20.225 --> 50:21.435
[sighs]

50:22.644 --> 50:24.313
[cell phone vibrating]

50:30.485 --> 50:33.822
[Frank]  Another 20 minutes,
Mount Zion Cemetery.

50:33.905 --> 50:35.949
-Hurry up, Lieberman.
- [line disconnects]

50:39.994 --> 50:41.246
Asshole.

50:48.795 --> 50:51.631
[Curtis] Hey, Frank.
Your boy's on his way.

50:51.715 --> 50:53.758
He's clean and alone.

50:53.842 --> 50:56.886
2002 blue Chevy Impala.

50:56.970 --> 51:00.099
Yeah, he's not expecting
any high-speed chases, that's for sure.

51:01.224 --> 51:02.184
Yeah.

51:08.815 --> 51:11.985
[Frank]  I don't need to tell you
where to come, do I, David?

51:46.060 --> 51:48.062
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Who are you?

51:48.980 --> 51:51.483
Castle has you in his crosshairs
right now, buddy.

51:52.401 --> 51:55.404
If you shoot me, you will be next.

51:55.487 --> 51:56.780
Why isn't he here?

51:56.863 --> 51:59.158
He decided he doesn't like
what you're selling.

51:59.866 --> 52:01.243
Frank's in the wind.

52:01.701 --> 52:04.871
If you try to find him again,
he will visit Sarah.

52:07.207 --> 52:09.042
He said you'd know what that meant.

52:10.293 --> 52:11.128
Hold on.

52:11.920 --> 52:13.087
Hey...

52:14.089 --> 52:14.923
Hey!

52:29.396 --> 52:30.980
Castle!

52:33.900 --> 52:35.235
You need me!

53:42.969 --> 53:44.388
[sighs]

53:46.055 --> 53:47.474
[muttering]

53:52.604 --> 53:55.565
No, no, no. Think, think, think. Come on.

53:55.649 --> 53:57.359
[inhales deeply]

53:57.442 --> 53:58.777
[sighs]

54:00.779 --> 54:01.780
Come on...

54:03.448 --> 54:04.658
[sighs]

54:06.826 --> 54:08.662
Think, think, think.

54:08.745 --> 54:10.204
What's going on?

54:11.205 --> 54:12.707
What are we doing? What are we doing?

54:14.208 --> 54:15.544
[sighs]

54:27.972 --> 54:29.182
[sighs]

54:43.572 --> 54:44.989
[laughs]

54:49.243 --> 54:50.329
Frank.

54:52.414 --> 54:53.498
-No.
