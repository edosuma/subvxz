[Booth]
Florida? Today?

00:03.136 --> 00:05.070
- Is that work?
- Yeah.

00:05.138 --> 00:07.072
Hot, fun, Miami, Florida...

00:07.140 --> 00:10.200
or sticky, you know,
swampy Florida?

00:10.276 --> 00:12.210
- <i>[Man] Really.</i>
- You're welcome. God.

00:12.278 --> 00:14.678
- What's going on in Florida?
- Wait a sec. What flight?

00:14.748 --> 00:16.739
- # [Calliope]
- Hold on for a second. I can't hear you.

00:16.816 --> 00:18.750
Enough with the song already,
all right?

00:18.818 --> 00:20.945
I'm doing business here.
Deal with it!

00:21.021 --> 00:23.546
Hold on for a second.
Now my pen's out of ink.

00:23.623 --> 00:26.717
- Here.
- Oh, hold on. I can't hear anything!

00:26.793 --> 00:30.126
- The kids love the music.
- Well, I don't see any kids.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.460
The music attracts them!

00:32.531 --> 00:36.969
Did you say the Everglades? Look, I can't
hear anything because of this insane music!

00:37.037 --> 00:39.005
- <i>[Gunshots]</i>
- # [Stops]

00:39.072 --> 00:41.506
- <i>[People Screaming]</i>
- You shot my clown!

00:41.574 --> 00:43.405
Great. Flight number?

00:43.476 --> 00:45.671
- <i>[Man] Move out of the way!</i>
- <i>Hey! He shot my clown!</i>

00:45.745 --> 00:47.645
- [Electricity Crackles]
- <i>[Booth] Okay. Thanks.</i>

00:47.714 --> 00:52.651
- Okay. We're all set.
- That was not good.

<i>I thought you said you'd be down</i>
<i>on the next flight.</i>

01:07.300 --> 01:09.860
- <i>[Booth On Phone]</i>
<i>Well, I haven't met with the shrink yet.</i>
- What shrink?

01:09.936 --> 01:13.736
<i>Well, the department psychiatrist has to</i>
<i>sign a piece of paper saying, you know...</i>

01:13.807 --> 01:16.173
that I'm not nuts
before I get my gun back.

01:16.242 --> 01:17.709
So, I got
an appointment tomorrow.

01:17.777 --> 01:22.009
Great. Now I have to break in
this... Agent Sullivan?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.016
<i>Wait. Sully's a great guy.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

01:24.084 --> 01:27.053
- And for your information, you never broke me in.
- Oh, I think that's him.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.611
- Okay, I'll talk to you later.
- <i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>

01:31.224 --> 01:33.658
[Sighs]

01:35.161 --> 01:37.095
Dr. Brennan?

01:37.163 --> 01:39.358
- Agent Sullivan?
- Uh-huh.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.265
- Name's Eugene.
- Okay, Eugene.

01:42.335 --> 01:45.532
No, not me. I'm Sully.
Short for Sullivan.

01:45.605 --> 01:49.041
- Well, then, who's Eugene?
- [Man] Right here.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.044
<i>Eugene's been king of this swamp</i>
<i>for as long as I can remember.</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:53.909
Broke my heart to
have to shoot him.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.845
Is there an actual human victim?

01:55.915 --> 01:59.316
- Inside Eugene.
- He ate somebody?

01:59.385 --> 02:01.580
Damn spring breakers
think it's a real kick...

02:01.654 --> 02:03.519
to come here
and drink beer with the big fella.

02:03.590 --> 02:06.024
I just chased off a bunch of'em.

02:06.092 --> 02:09.527
And there was Eugene in the middle
of the swamp gulping down somebody's arm.

02:09.596 --> 02:12.064
Someone from the group of kids
you chased off?

02:12.132 --> 02:14.692
No. No, gators
don't eat fresh kills.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.701
They drown their prey.

02:16.769 --> 02:20.261
They stuff it down underwater to tenderize
for a few weeks before they can eat 'em.

02:20.340 --> 02:23.867
<i>Okay. Why don't you drag the rest</i>
<i>of the swamp for any additional remains?</i>

02:23.943 --> 02:26.537
I'll check Fort Lauderdale missing persons.
<i>You</i> start cutting.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.604
No.

02:29.616 --> 02:31.675
Wh... Isn't that what you do?

02:31.751 --> 02:35.278
Any potential remains
are far too sensitive to be retrieved here.

02:35.355 --> 02:38.222
[Sighs]
Okay. Well, where... where do you suggest?

02:38.291 --> 02:41.783
- My lab at theJeffersonian.
- The whole gator?

02:41.861 --> 02:44.386
I'll handle transport.

02:44.464 --> 02:47.922
- You're gonna need a big crate.
- [Scoffs] And a lot of ice.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.762
Okeydoke. Well, if you're doing this...

02:51.838 --> 02:54.568
then there's a boat for sale
that I'd like to check out.

02:54.641 --> 02:57.201
<i>A boat? Booth helps.</i>

02:57.277 --> 03:01.111
- 'Cause Booth can't relax.
- There's something metal in here.

03:01.181 --> 03:05.413
[Grunts]
Uh-huh.

03:09.055 --> 03:11.546
- <i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>
- Don't you have a boat to buy?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.628
I knew it was a gator.
Brennan told me it was a gator.

03:56.703 --> 04:00.104
- And yet... wow.
- Definitely confirms one thing.

04:00.173 --> 04:04.007
- We have the coolest jobs ever.
- Look at all these teeth.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.308
<i>Step away, please.</i>
<i>There are 80 in total.</i>

04:07.380 --> 04:09.348
Note the conical shape.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.849
"Step away, please?"
Just because you have a doctorate now...

04:11.918 --> 04:15.285
does not mean I won't
use you as a swizzle stick.

04:15.355 --> 04:19.154
Animal foot.
Possibly a rabbit.

04:19.225 --> 04:21.625
Not so lucky
for either of them.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.685
- Frog.
- Yummy.

04:23.763 --> 04:28.291
- Do I hear music?
- <i># [Latin, Muffled]</i>

04:29.969 --> 04:32.904
# [Continues]

04:32.972 --> 04:36.169
- # [Stops]
- Hey. I liked that song.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.576
What do you think, Zack?

04:46.219 --> 04:48.153
Definitely a human foot.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.382
Lovely.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.353
Dr. Wyatt.

04:56.429 --> 04:59.421
Ah, Agent Booth, is it?
Yes. Gordon. Gordon Wyatt.

04:59.499 --> 05:03.094
- Right. You're the shrink?
- Uh, shrink, yes, meaning psychiatrist.

05:03.169 --> 05:06.002
That's great, Doc. How's about
you just sign my piece of paper here...

05:06.072 --> 05:09.007
- and I'll get back to work.
- Uh, certainly. No, no. I have a pen.

05:09.075 --> 05:12.340
- Okay.
- Do you mind if I ask what
exactly it was that you did?

05:12.412 --> 05:14.607
- Yeah, I shot a truck.
- Ah.

05:14.681 --> 05:18.344
Full of terrorists, no doubt,
or plutonium or fleeing felons, was it?

05:18.418 --> 05:22.081
- No. It was an ice cream truck.
- Do you have a good reason for firing on it?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.555
- Yeah. The music, it was bothering me.
- Ah.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.717
Yeah. There was a speaker
in the clown's mouth.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.057
- Oh.
- Yeah, I just pulled out my gun, you know, and...

05:29.128 --> 05:31.358
[Imitates Gunshots]
It was gone.

05:31.431 --> 05:34.229
So the F.B.I. sent you to me
because you shot a clown?

05:34.300 --> 05:36.632
Not a real clown.

05:36.703 --> 05:41.197
I suggest you cogitate on the underlying reasons
you shot that clown while I make us some tea.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.902
What? Cogitate?

05:43.976 --> 05:45.910
Tea?

05:46.112 --> 05:49.479
The depth of these bite marks...
very impressive.

05:49.549 --> 05:54.543
One torn pair of jeans.
One red linen blouse, size two.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.645
And one platform wedge.

05:56.723 --> 05:59.157
Made it all the way
to the lower intestine.

05:59.225 --> 06:02.558
Florida F.B.I. just beamed over
names of recent missing persons.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.061
We'll need dental records.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.328
- Sully!
- <i>Cam!</i>

06:07.400 --> 06:10.267
Look at you, in charge of
Moon Base Alpha here.

06:10.336 --> 06:12.270
And you're still a G-man.

06:12.338 --> 06:15.273
What happened to that restaurant you were
gonna open? Or was it a petting zoo?

06:15.341 --> 06:19.437
Well, I am keeping myself open
for the perfect opportunity.

06:19.512 --> 06:22.003
- I tried out a beautiful boat.
- But he made it back to shore.

06:22.081 --> 06:24.948
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>Victim is female, in her late teens...</i>

06:25.017 --> 06:26.678
eliminating three of
your missing persons right here.

06:26.753 --> 06:29.347
- So cause of death?
- For the gator?

06:29.422 --> 06:34.189
We have these.45-caliber slugs.
As for the girl's, so far we've got the gator.

06:34.260 --> 06:39.664
Okeydoke. Well, um,
I am gonna go grab a slice.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.860
So give me a call
when you got an I.D.

06:42.935 --> 06:46.962
Her name's Judy Dowd.

06:47.039 --> 06:49.439
Shouldn't you at least look at the X-rays
before deciding that?

06:49.509 --> 06:53.036
<i>It says right here she had surgery</i>
<i>to repair a cleft palate at age two.</i>

06:53.112 --> 06:56.707
The bone graft is here.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.047
She was a freshman
at Virginia State.

06:59.118 --> 07:01.643
Reported missing three weeks ago.

07:08.027 --> 07:11.622
An alligator?
Oh, my God.

07:11.697 --> 07:14.359
When did you last
see your daughter, Mr. Dowd?

07:14.434 --> 07:18.370
The day she left with her friend
for spring break.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.805
<i>Her friend, uh, Abigail Sims?</i>

07:21.874 --> 07:25.640
Abby. A good kid.

07:25.711 --> 07:28.976
[Voice Breaking]
I never should've let her go.

07:31.717 --> 07:34.550
We found this among the remains.

07:34.620 --> 07:39.648
<i>This was her mother's.</i>
<i>Lanie died when Judes was 11.</i>

07:44.864 --> 07:47.526
It's just been
the two of us ever since.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.160
<i>Did you get any calls from her</i>
<i>while she was there?</i>

07:50.236 --> 07:52.363
Every day.

07:52.438 --> 07:55.339
Any sign that she was in trouble?

07:56.742 --> 07:59.142
No. She...

07:59.212 --> 08:01.703
[Sighs]
She sounded happy.

08:03.182 --> 08:05.582
So happy.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.424
[Sniffles]

08:14.961 --> 08:17.555
You are <i>really</i> English.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.326
Oh, I don't know.
I think I've assimilated quite well.

08:20.399 --> 08:24.927
Typical American house, right down to
the white picket fence, a truck that's the, uh...

08:25.004 --> 08:28.201
What is it? "The heartbeat of America?"
But tea?

08:28.274 --> 08:30.572
Tea is, uh, sacrosanct,
thank you very much.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.804
Me? I'm a coffee drinker.
Hey, listen, pal.

08:32.879 --> 08:35.712
You know, in an effort to
understand your culture better...

08:35.780 --> 08:41.082
I've been trying to embrace this very American
practice of preparing meat in the garden.

08:41.153 --> 08:45.419
- Barbecue.
- <i>Mmm, it's a delightful word, isn't it? Barbecue.</i>

08:45.491 --> 08:46.924
I think it's from the Caribbean, <i>barabicu...</i>

08:46.993 --> 08:49.757
which means
a sort of sacred fire pit.

08:49.829 --> 08:54.232
Did you know that the Latin for hearth,
though, is "focus?" Isn't that revealing?

08:54.300 --> 08:57.428
It's quite literally
the focal point of every household.

08:57.503 --> 09:00.904
The hearth, the heart.
Hmm? Interesting.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.168
I told the ice cream guy
I was sorry, all right?

09:03.242 --> 09:06.769
l-l-I even bought him a new clown head.
So just sign the paper.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.314
[Sighs]
I must apologize.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.681
But I've got to go off and get
some ingredients for my mortar.

09:12.752 --> 09:15.949
- Um, why don't we reschedule?
- We can't <i>reschedule,</i> all right?

09:16.022 --> 09:17.785
I gotta get back to work.

09:17.857 --> 09:20.155
Oh. Well, in that case...

09:20.226 --> 09:24.253
um, why not finish off
preparing this area here?

09:24.330 --> 09:27.356
Could you do that?
All the specifications are on the plans.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.628
You are fit for physical labor,
aren't you?

09:29.702 --> 09:32.637
I mean, the, uh, the clown
didn't return fire, did it?

09:32.705 --> 09:35.640
Oh, what if I said that
the plastic clown <i>did</i> fire back, huh?

09:35.708 --> 09:38.438
Brilliant.
[Chuckles]

09:38.511 --> 09:42.538
Now while I'm gone, what I want you to do
is to consider what you were really aiming at...

09:42.615 --> 09:44.606
when you drew a bead
on that unfortunate clown.

09:44.684 --> 09:48.120
Hey, buddy, when I aim at something,
I hit it.

09:48.187 --> 09:50.314
Precisely.

09:50.389 --> 09:53.825
Anyway, I shan't be long, Agent.
It's all on the plans here.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.088
I'll be back before long, Agent.
See you then.

09:56.162 --> 09:58.460
Do help yourself to more tea
by the way.

10:00.533 --> 10:03.969
Like I told the police, me and Judy were
just doing the usual spring break stuff.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.368
<i>The whole night was</i>
<i>kind of a blur...</i>

10:06.439 --> 10:10.068
until I woke up the next morning
at the hotel, and Judy wasn't there.

10:10.142 --> 10:13.373
- She hadn't come back with you?
- I can't remember.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.971
So why didn't you report it to someone
till later that night?

10:16.048 --> 10:18.881
- I thought maybe she'd hooked up.
- Hooked up?

10:18.951 --> 10:21.920
Hooked up.

10:21.988 --> 10:25.014
Uh, with anyone in particular?

10:25.091 --> 10:28.424
We met so many guys.
You know how it is.

10:28.494 --> 10:31.554
<i>I'm guessing that she doesn't.</i>

10:31.631 --> 10:34.361
Do you have any pictures
from that night, Abby?

10:34.433 --> 10:36.526
No. The police
took most of them.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.593
Wait. Most of them?

10:38.671 --> 10:41.299
<i>There's a couple</i>
<i>on my personal Web page.</i>

10:41.374 --> 10:43.342
I didn't want them
showing poor Mr. Dowd.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.276
Judy would never want him
seeing her like that.

10:47.346 --> 10:49.871
Like what?

10:53.185 --> 10:57.519
<i>Here's the spectrophotometric evaluation</i>
<i>on Judy Dowd. Any results on her tox screen?</i>

10:57.590 --> 10:59.751
No drugs, but her blood-alcohol
was sky high.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.554
Point 11. And...

11:03.195 --> 11:05.720
- <i>Oh, dear.</i>
- <i>[Angela] What?</i>

11:05.798 --> 11:08.130
S.P.M. reveals hidden hematomas
in decomp tissue.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.758
<i>See this shaded area here?</i>

11:09.835 --> 11:12.303
It indicates bruising
to her vaginal wall.

11:12.371 --> 11:14.032
Meaning Judy was raped.

11:14.106 --> 11:17.872
<i>Or at the very least, subjected to</i>
<i>some extremely unpleasant college sex.</i>

11:17.943 --> 11:19.604
With one of these fine lads?

11:19.679 --> 11:22.546
<i>[Saroyan] Without D.N.A.,</i>
<i>it's the proverbial needle in a haystack.</i>

11:22.615 --> 11:25.914
Wait. Our victim was an H.S. B?

11:25.985 --> 11:29.045
- Excuse me?
- HottyStudentBody. com.

11:29.121 --> 11:31.248
<i>It's this Web site that</i>
<i>gets drunk college girls...</i>

11:31.323 --> 11:33.257
from all over the East Coast
to take their clothes off.

11:34.460 --> 11:37.156
I clicked on a pop-up,
got caught in a "pornado."

11:38.964 --> 11:40.829
What?

11:45.037 --> 11:49.804
<i>Oh, splendid. So it was your father</i>
<i>who taught you to read plans, was it?</i>

11:49.875 --> 11:51.934
Wrong tree, Doc, okay?
Dad and I were tight.

11:52.011 --> 11:56.744
Only, it's just that earlier you said that
you weren't used to drinking tea with men...

11:56.816 --> 12:01.810
which suggests to me that you're usually
pretty rigid in your assignment of gender roles.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.617
What? No, no.
My-My partner's a woman, okay?

12:04.690 --> 12:06.817
A woman who needs my help.

12:06.892 --> 12:10.453
Hmm. But are you
currently involved with anyone?

12:10.529 --> 12:13.862
I just broke up with someone, okay?
Me. And I ended it.

12:13.933 --> 12:17.460
And how long had you been
involved with her? O-Or him?

12:17.536 --> 12:19.800
Her. Let's get that straight, okay?
Her.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.103
- Couple months this time.
- This time?

12:24.176 --> 12:28.806
We'd gone out...
We'd gone out before a-a f-few years ago.

12:28.881 --> 12:30.815
And you know, we, uh...

12:30.883 --> 12:34.819
I broke it up when, uh, you know,
my ex wanted to give it another go.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.650
[Winces]
Complicated.

12:36.722 --> 12:39.452
Ah! That's it!

12:39.525 --> 12:43.825
I shot the clown because
I can't let go of the women in my life.

12:43.896 --> 12:47.491
Ha! Thanks, Doc. All right.
Now, I can go back to work.

12:47.566 --> 12:50.626
And you can sign the paper!

12:50.703 --> 12:53.695
Excellent theory,
but quite wrong.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.174
And we're out of time.

12:57.243 --> 12:59.541
Tomorrow all right for you?

12:59.612 --> 13:03.673
Just right. Yes.
[Sighs]

13:06.752 --> 13:09.653
- We found a stab wound.
- Let's see it.

13:09.722 --> 13:12.247
It's more of a puncture, really.

13:12.324 --> 13:15.225
Hidden here among the bite marks
just below her scapula.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.692
Angela doesn't like me
being her superior.

13:18.764 --> 13:22.598
- Because you're acting superior.
- Which is what a superior is.

13:22.668 --> 13:25.865
Don't be a horse's ass. She's your friend.
That's all that matters.

13:25.938 --> 13:29.430
These ridge marks inside the wound
look like the threads of a screw.

13:29.508 --> 13:32.170
We're trying to I.D. the weapon.

13:32.244 --> 13:35.543
At the least, it proves Judy didn't stumble
into the swamp and feed herself to Eugene.

13:35.614 --> 13:40.415
- That was my conclusion as well.
- Okay.

13:40.486 --> 13:44.081
And the hits keep coming.
It seems Judy Dowd was raped and murdered.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.090
No more rough college sex?

13:46.158 --> 13:49.025
<i>Now that we know it's a murder,</i>
<i>I'm feeling a lot less charitable.</i>

13:49.094 --> 13:51.562
- [Laughing]
- # [Hip-Hop]

13:53.199 --> 13:55.133
- <i>[Brennan] What is all this?</i>
- Have a look.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.226
[Together]
Hotties by the pool!

13:59.505 --> 14:02.372
<i>It was shot in Fort Lauderdale</i>
<i>the same nightJudy disappeared.</i>

14:02.441 --> 14:05.638
- <i>[Brennan] Who is that?</i>
- His name's Monte Gold.

14:05.711 --> 14:08.407
<i>Internet kingpin</i>
<i>and aspiring Hugh Hefner.</i>

14:08.480 --> 14:10.710
<i>Monte has made millions</i>
<i>off of this site.</i>

14:10.783 --> 14:14.742
<i>He also paid out a million in fines</i>
<i>last year for filming underage girls.</i>

14:14.820 --> 14:19.223
<i>[Brennan] I wonder ifhe knows you can't</i>
<i>just pay a fine if you murder someone.</i>

14:28.033 --> 14:30.661
<i># [Background: Dance]</i>

14:30.736 --> 14:32.795
Dude, she's all over you.
What are you doing?

14:32.872 --> 14:36.137
Whoo! Look at this, baby!

14:36.208 --> 14:38.608
- Monte Gold?
- Uh-oh. Grown-ups with badges.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.872
- <i>Lloyd?</i>
- Hi, um, I'm Monte's producer, Lloyd.

14:40.946 --> 14:42.914
We've got shooting permits
and signed waivers.

14:42.982 --> 14:46.008
- You know this girl?
- <i>[Brennan] She's on your Web site.</i>

14:46.085 --> 14:49.486
And a thousand more. Might as well ask
a Chinese guy to remember a grain of rice.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.490
- She's not a grain of rice, sport.
- She's dead.

14:55.327 --> 14:57.261
Eddie, off!
Cameras off!

14:57.329 --> 14:59.320
- Go away, babies. Shoo. Let's go.
- <i>[Girls] Aw.</i>

14:59.398 --> 15:02.424
- What do you mean dead?
- Her name's Judy Dowd.

15:02.501 --> 15:05.993
We found her in Florida raped,
murdered, and fed to an alligator.

15:06.071 --> 15:09.199
And she's posted on my Web site?
Lloyd, do you know about this?

15:09.275 --> 15:11.470
- How would I know?
- Get her off. Now, Lloyd.

15:11.543 --> 15:13.704
- <i>Now! Go!</i>
- All right, all right.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.781
You say an alligator?

15:17.850 --> 15:20.478
<i>[Lloyd]</i>
<i>We never would've posted her if we knew.</i>

15:20.552 --> 15:23.919
- Monte is insanely careful.
- Not always, from what I hear.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.923
But he learns from his mistakes.

15:25.991 --> 15:29.620
Now every I.D. triple-checked for 18
before any girl signs the waiver.

15:29.695 --> 15:33.153
- <i>Idiot! You let her on my bus?</i>
- I didn't want to be rude.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.792
Off the bus.
Your boyfriend has no warrant.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.496
You know, anthropologically speaking,
you follow a very ancient tradition.

15:38.570 --> 15:41.971
Okay. Entrepreneur?

15:42.041 --> 15:46.637
- Pimp.
- Class is over. Off the bus.

15:49.815 --> 15:52.511
Here you go.
Follow his path. Learn his word.

15:52.584 --> 15:54.677
<i>You, too.</i>
<i>Follow his path. Learn his word.</i>

15:54.753 --> 15:59.690
Uh-oh. There it is! Another misguided waif
tumbles from the devil's sin-mobile!

15:59.758 --> 16:01.919
- Excuse me?
- <i>Uh, no. She's with me.</i>

16:01.994 --> 16:05.589
Why are you winking?
I'm not with... He's with me.

16:05.664 --> 16:10.601
This is Isaac. Isaac's with The Church of
the High Calling from way down in Eldon, Kansas.

16:10.669 --> 16:13.365
<i>Yeah. But let me tell you something.</i>
<i>There is no distance too great...</i>

16:13.439 --> 16:18.536
to dissuade these lost young women from
the grips of Monte Gold's carnal temptation.

16:18.610 --> 16:21.704
<i>[Brennan] Looks like you plan on</i>
<i>saving a lot of souls.</i>

16:21.780 --> 16:26.183
- <i>[Sully] Women like this?</i>
- Oh. Uh-oh.

16:26.251 --> 16:28.651
Who is she? Huh?
What did Monte do to her?

16:28.721 --> 16:31.451
- <i>[Monte] Give it a rest, Isaac.</i>
- Monte? Hey.

16:31.523 --> 16:33.753
<i>Hey, remember me? I'm Alan.</i>
<i>I sent you, uh, my résumé.</i>

16:33.826 --> 16:36.795
- <i>Not now, man.</i>
- Hey, hey, look. I'm a great webmaster.

16:36.862 --> 16:40.764
- Another sinner about to throw
hisself into Satan's hellfire.
- Shut up, freak!

Get him out of here.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.968
- You'll never work for me, pal.
- <i>[Girl] What's that about?</i>

16:50.342 --> 16:52.276
God even fed you today, Isaac?

16:52.344 --> 16:55.142
Okay, let's get you a sandwich.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.705
- Eddie, make the preacher some food, will ya?
- Yeah.

16:57.783 --> 17:00.217
<i>What? The wing nuts</i>
<i>come with the territory.</i>

17:00.285 --> 17:03.448
<i>All right. Let's quit playing games.</i>
<i>What is it you want to know?</i>

17:03.522 --> 17:06.286
- Fort Lauderdale.
- Lauderdale was Lauderdale.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.987
Partied that night. Gave some
willing girls their 15 minutes of fame...

17:10.061 --> 17:12.622
and, uh, headed out to Daytona
for the next day's gig.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.758
- Any girls ride with you?
- As much as I hate to disappoint you...

17:15.834 --> 17:18.803
uh, fact is, I'm not entertaining
like I used to.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.771
Ah. Getting too old to exploit
little drunk girls?

17:21.839 --> 17:24.637
You seen the videos?
They exploit themselves.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.644
- Ready to roll when you are, Monte.
- [Clicks Tongue] Yeah.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.805
<i>Now they all want to be</i>
<i>a Hotty Body.</i>

17:28.881 --> 17:33.614
Walk into a place and the shirts fly off,
making what used to be a rush kinda...

17:33.685 --> 17:35.744
I don't know, mundane.

17:35.821 --> 17:39.313
Because you <i>objectify</i> them.
You never see what makes them human.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.451
[Scoffs]
Man, you have to spend all day with her?

17:42.528 --> 17:45.497
<i>Yeah. An actual woman.</i>
<i>You oughta try it sometime.</i>

17:45.564 --> 17:49.125
Video's off the site.
There's a copy of the girl's waiver.

17:49.201 --> 17:52.329
You know, I think I, uh...
I think I remember this girl.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.929
- You do?
- <i>Yeah. You remember, Lloyd.</i>

17:55.007 --> 17:56.941
<i>We were leaving</i>
<i>the Lauderdale gig...</i>

17:57.009 --> 17:59.807
and you made a joke about
the bouncer swapping spit with that girl?

17:59.878 --> 18:02.005
- That was this girl?
- Pretty sure.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.606
<i>Oh, she was hot.</i>

18:04.683 --> 18:07.618
<i>Passed the two of them</i>
<i>playing tonsil hockey in the doorway.</i>

18:07.686 --> 18:10.382
<i>That bouncer was a big dude too.</i>

18:10.456 --> 18:12.947
- And it's <i>me</i> you're harassing?
- <i>[Lloyd] Let's go, Eddie.</i>

18:17.963 --> 18:21.831
This waiver is a joke.
I mean, look atJudy's signature.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.834
She could barely hold a pen.

18:23.902 --> 18:26.735
Well, Florida Bureau's gonna
scoop up this bouncer and call me back.

18:26.805 --> 18:31.174
- We need to get back in that bus.
- Well, we need cause for a warrant.

18:31.243 --> 18:35.009
You tell Mario
that he is still an artist.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.138
- <i>Sure thing.</i>
- What is that?

18:36.215 --> 18:38.149
Mmm!

18:38.217 --> 18:40.481
Only the finest
sausage and peppers on earth.

18:40.552 --> 18:43.749
Someday, I'm gonna turn it
into a franchise. You want a bite?

18:43.822 --> 18:45.585
I thought you were buying a boat.

18:45.657 --> 18:48.990
I am. Well, maybe
I'll start a charter service.

18:49.061 --> 18:52.394
I can serve these to the passengers,
you know? In Jamaica.

18:52.464 --> 18:55.661
- Good.
- Mmm, the word is great.

18:55.734 --> 18:59.500
Or maybe I'll manage a band, you know?
They could play on the boat too.

18:59.571 --> 19:02.335
So you don't...
You don't like being an F.B.I. agent?

19:02.407 --> 19:06.070
Oh, sure. l-I do. I just don't want it
to be the only thing I ever was.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.079
[Chuckles]

19:10.682 --> 19:13.515
You're telling me you're just gonna be
a bone lady your whole life?

19:13.585 --> 19:16.713
I spent years
studying anthropology.

19:16.788 --> 19:20.849
Well, I got a degree.
But I'm not gonna let it ruin my life.

19:22.694 --> 19:25.356
- I'm going back to the lab.
- Mmm, here!

19:25.430 --> 19:27.455
Take one of these with you
back to that spaceship.

19:27.533 --> 19:30.093
I'll call you when
we get our bouncer.

19:32.070 --> 19:35.528
<i>Mmm, mmm.</i>
<i>Mmm, Jamaica.</i>

19:35.607 --> 19:37.837
I can dig it, man.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.212
- Oh.
- Hi.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.214
Um, do we have a schedule?

19:43.282 --> 19:45.443
Uh, listen.
I really need to get back to work.

19:45.517 --> 19:49.146
So why don't you give me one of those clown
restraining orders and just sign my paper?

19:49.221 --> 19:53.715
- Have you had an insight then as
to why you shot at that clown?
- Yeah.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.727
- You know what?
I have some insight. It's right here.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]

19:56.795 --> 20:00.822
That's my Bones calling, huh?
My partner. Right? Yeah. Bones.

20:00.899 --> 20:02.799
So when are you
coming back again?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.597
What? Aren't you
playing nice with Sully?

20:04.670 --> 20:07.070
- I'm not sure how serious he is about his job.
- Look.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.664
He's one of the best.
He just likes to keep his options open.

20:09.741 --> 20:12.471
- I've noticed.
- Listen, Bones.

20:12.544 --> 20:16.241
Sully, he, uh, lost his partner
about, uh, a year ago. All right?

20:16.315 --> 20:18.249
Something like that happens,
you just...

20:18.317 --> 20:21.514
You hear that clock on the inside
ticking just a little bit louder.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.782
So, uh, you know what?
You're in good hands.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.652
Here he comes.
So I gotta go. Gotta go.

20:27.759 --> 20:31.126
Hey. All right, so maybe
I am a little irritable.

20:31.196 --> 20:34.825
Why do you think
that might be?

20:34.900 --> 20:38.666
Come on. Look, don't they give you,
like, papers and files and reports and...

20:41.206 --> 20:44.437
All right. Um...
[Exhales]

20:46.345 --> 20:50.645
Me and my partner caught up to this serial killer
by the name of Howard Epps, and he died.

20:50.716 --> 20:53.014
And whose fault was that?
Yours or your partner's?

20:53.085 --> 20:56.486
Oh, no. He jumped over that balcony
because of her.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.785
[Chuckles] Sometimes
I think he had the right idea.

21:00.058 --> 21:03.118
And where were you when Mr. Epps fell?

21:03.195 --> 21:05.163
Holding his arm.

21:05.230 --> 21:08.529
- No, that was <i>before</i> he fell, surely.
- What?

21:08.600 --> 21:12.400
Well, Mr. Epps was dangling
from your arm before he fell.

21:12.471 --> 21:15.872
At which point, he was
no longer dangling, but falling.

21:15.941 --> 21:19.001
Attached to you, he was alive.
No longer attached, dead.

21:19.077 --> 21:22.478
Well, I don't feel guilty about that.
I mean, Epps is a serial killer.

21:22.547 --> 21:24.845
He tried to kill my partner,
and he threatened my son.

21:24.916 --> 21:27.043
<i>I was glad</i>
<i>when he hit that pavement.</i>

21:27.119 --> 21:29.019
Do you think about suicide
often?

21:29.087 --> 21:32.545
Suicide? Me?

21:32.624 --> 21:35.024
No, no. Never.

21:35.093 --> 21:38.756
And yet, you sometimes feel that Howard Epps
had the right idea about jumping off that balcony?

21:38.830 --> 21:41.594
It was a joke. Okay?
It was a joke.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.159
Yes. You do that a lot,
don't you?

21:46.505 --> 21:48.530
Makes me feel such a bully
for prying.

21:48.607 --> 21:51.735
Well, we'll pick up on this
next time.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.175
[Scoffs]

21:59.284 --> 22:04.415
Increase magnification,
<i>please,</i> if you're ready.

22:04.489 --> 22:08.016
- I don't mean to appear dictatorial...
- I get it, Zack.

22:09.127 --> 22:12.062
- Hey.
- So what are we looking at?

22:12.130 --> 22:16.191
Bits of gold foil embedded deep within
bite marks along the T11 and T12 vertebrae.

22:16.268 --> 22:17.701
Jewelry?

22:17.769 --> 22:20.966
More likely scenario has the gator's teeth
piercing Judy's stomach.

22:21.039 --> 22:23.974
<i>Embedding whatever</i>
<i>she last ingested into her bone.</i>

22:24.042 --> 22:26.272
How would someone eat gold?

22:26.345 --> 22:29.280
Not eat. Drink.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.784
- Goldenrod.
- Goldenrod?

22:32.851 --> 22:36.116
It's this hundred-proof cinnamon schnapps
that we drank in college.

22:36.188 --> 22:40.887
It's infused with real gold flakes,
purely for decadence' sake.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.824
How did it taste?

22:42.894 --> 22:45.954
Oh. It's way worse coming up,
I can tell you that.

22:49.468 --> 22:51.732
<i>She could've wandered into</i>
<i>bars we don't know about.</i>

22:51.803 --> 22:54.203
If we can find every place
that carries that stuff...

22:54.272 --> 22:58.140
I don't think we'll need to, Doc.
We've got our bouncer.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.838
Of course, he denies all.
But his alibi just about buries him.

23:00.912 --> 23:04.780
- Buries him how?
- He left work early that night
to get to his other job...

23:04.850 --> 23:07.148
<i>giving midnight</i>
<i>swamp tours on his boat.</i>

23:07.219 --> 23:09.744
Sounds like a good job actually.

23:09.821 --> 23:12.517
So, he's admitted to knowing the Everglades
like the back of his hand.

23:12.591 --> 23:15.492
<i>Which would not be smart</i>
<i>ifhe were, in fact, the killer.</i>

23:15.560 --> 23:17.653
Most of the killers I know
aren't all that smart.

23:17.729 --> 23:21.096
The gold flakes are definitely from
the liquor we found in her system.

23:21.166 --> 23:25.262
- And I remembered something.
- Monte and his harem. So what?

23:25.337 --> 23:28.773
Check out the caption.
"All the girls love Monte's gold!"

23:28.840 --> 23:31.934
Now, granted, there are plenty of bars
that carry this stuff. But...

23:32.010 --> 23:34.945
But this could be the probable cause
we need to search Monte's bus.

23:35.013 --> 23:36.776
- I'll get the warrant.
- [Phone Beeps]

23:50.128 --> 23:52.153
Bouncer's alibi checked out.

23:52.230 --> 23:55.131
So Monte's minions were likely
just trying to throw us off.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.725
Unbelievable, you people.
What is it now?

23:57.803 --> 24:00.465
Hey, hey, cool your jets, Hef.
We just want to search your bus.

24:00.539 --> 24:03.167
- This is you, isn't it?
- Please don't point your finger at me.

24:03.241 --> 24:05.300
I knew the first time I saw you...

24:05.377 --> 24:09.336
here comes another feminist crusader
out to spoil some good, all-American fun.

24:09.414 --> 24:11.848
Ow. Get off! Get off.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.511
- <i>It was self-defense. He assaulted me.</i>
- Yes, he did.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.687
Crazy bitch.
I'm calling my lawyer.

24:17.756 --> 24:20.418
Here. You can read him this.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.187
Now I just hope we find something.

24:25.263 --> 24:27.060
<i>[Laughing On Television]</i>

24:27.132 --> 24:30.101
- <i>There.</i>
- Well, it's not exactly a smoking gun.

24:30.168 --> 24:33.103
- Can you prove she drank it here?
- I can try.

24:33.171 --> 24:36.607
Okay. You can only admit evidence
that's in plain view.

24:36.675 --> 24:41.078
Although on this bus, that could be
D.N.A. on virtually any surface.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.444
That's an image.

24:43.515 --> 24:45.881
Keep your eyes open
for a metal screw-threaded thingy.

24:45.951 --> 24:50.786
- A what now?
- Judy's stab wound was probably
from a bolt of some kind...

24:50.856 --> 24:52.790
right through... here.

24:52.858 --> 24:55.725
Oh, just inside her scapula.

24:55.794 --> 25:00.254
Yes. But most laymen
refer to it as a shoulder blade.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.597
Well, I told you I went to college.

25:03.668 --> 25:07.968
I minored in kinesiology, although this is
the first time I've used it to impress a lady.

25:08.039 --> 25:10.701
[Both Chuckle]

25:10.775 --> 25:13.300
- What was your major?
- Art history.

25:13.378 --> 25:16.108
I also got a master's certificate in sailing...

25:16.181 --> 25:18.513
a pilot's license, and I'm a certified E.M.T.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.574
There's more,
but I don't want to brag.

25:20.652 --> 25:22.779
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- Hold on.

25:25.991 --> 25:28.619
- Hi, Hodgins.
- Judy Dowd wasn't killed at
the swamp where she was found.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.991
Cryptosporidium on her clothes
came from saw grass...

25:31.062 --> 25:33.496
a plant that doesn't even
grow in Eugene's swamp.

25:33.565 --> 25:36.591
- Where does it grow?
- Well, pretty much everywhere
else in the Everglades.

25:36.668 --> 25:39.398
<i>But in terms of gator distance,</i>
<i>there's a saw grass marsh two miles south...</i>

25:39.471 --> 25:41.405
where Alligator Alley
meets State Road 29.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.839
All that from cryptosporidium?

25:43.909 --> 25:47.037
Did I not mention
the fresh asphalt in Judy's shoe?

25:47.112 --> 25:50.275
That intersection was just repaved
about a month ago.

25:50.348 --> 25:52.646
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Very interesting.</i>

25:52.717 --> 25:55.584
- Thanks, Hodgins.
- Hmm? What's interesting?

26:01.293 --> 26:05.127
Miss Montenegro?
I'm Bill Dowd, Judy's father.

26:05.196 --> 26:08.097
Oh. Hi.

26:09.167 --> 26:11.499
Um, I'm sorry.
How do you know me?

26:11.570 --> 26:15.199
The F.B.I. told me that theJeffersonian
was investigating Judy's murder.

26:15.273 --> 26:18.333
I read your team's biographies online,
saw your picture.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.470
- And you followed me here?
- I'm sorry. I know how that must look.

26:21.546 --> 26:25.710
But I just... need answers.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.349
I need to know
who killed my daughter.

26:29.421 --> 26:33.380
I'm sorry, Mr. Dowd.
There's nothing I can tell you.

26:37.796 --> 26:43.359
I already know about the Web site...
and this Monte Gold son of a bitch.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.893
The F.B.I. told you about that?

26:46.972 --> 26:50.703
A buddy from my job
found the video.

26:50.775 --> 26:53.676
He thought I'd be embarrassed,
but all I care about is what happened next.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.709
Did this guy kill her?

26:57.782 --> 26:59.807
I really can't discuss the case.

26:59.884 --> 27:03.183
The way he's pawing at my girl
on that video, he's gotta be a suspect.

27:03.254 --> 27:07.315
At-At this point, Mr. Dowd,
there are a lot of suspects.

27:07.392 --> 27:11.328
But not many like him.
I mean, do you trust him?

27:11.396 --> 27:13.489
Do you think he's a good man?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.992
No. Of course not.

27:19.604 --> 27:21.902
I find him repulsive.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.109
Please. I just gotta know.

27:26.177 --> 27:28.111
Was it him?

27:32.984 --> 27:36.385
I'm very sorry about
your daughter, Mr. Dowd.

27:40.959 --> 27:42.893
There's nothing I can say.

27:42.961 --> 27:48.558
I understand.
I shouldn't have put you on the spot.

27:52.037 --> 27:54.028
I'm sorry.

28:04.115 --> 28:06.413
<i>You lied about the bouncer, Eddie.</i>

28:06.484 --> 28:08.418
- What?
- The bouncer in Lauderdale.

28:08.486 --> 28:11.614
<i>You never saw him kissing Judy Dowd</i>
<i>the night she went missing.</i>

28:11.690 --> 28:14.682
Really? I was sure it was them.

28:14.759 --> 28:18.695
- Uh, you drive the bus, too, don't you?
- Yeah, so?

28:18.763 --> 28:23.257
So you drove out of Lauderdale,
straight up the 95 to Daytona?

28:23.334 --> 28:25.427
Is that what Monte said?

28:26.971 --> 28:30.839
- Yeah, straight up 95.
- You sure about that?

28:30.909 --> 28:35.710
Oh. No, uh, that's right.
There was, uh, construction.

28:35.780 --> 28:38.340
We got detoured
cross state on 75.

28:38.416 --> 28:42.216
- Right, 75. Isn't that Alligator Alley?
- Mmm.

28:43.455 --> 28:46.982
Come on, Eddie.
A girl is dead.

28:47.058 --> 28:50.550
- We didn't kill her.
- But she was on your bus.

28:50.628 --> 28:53.620
She had a few drinks.
You have sex with her?

28:53.698 --> 28:57.259
No. No way.
I... was driving.

28:57.335 --> 29:00.793
- While Monte had sex with her?
- I guess.

29:00.872 --> 29:03.306
You guess?
Was-Was it consensual?

29:03.374 --> 29:07.003
All I know is she was drunk,
all right? Really drunk.

29:07.078 --> 29:10.741
And when Monte got done with her,
she came up by me wanting to get off the bus.

29:10.815 --> 29:13.010
- Eddie, don't say anything!
- Where were you in all this?

29:13.084 --> 29:17.453
- Lloyd drives in front of us.
It was me and Monte on the bus.
- Shut up, Eddie.

29:17.522 --> 29:20.650
<i>Monte's lawyer says that we don't have to</i>
<i>talk to anybody until he gets here.</i>

29:20.725 --> 29:23.285
He has nothing to worry about.
No one's under arrest.

29:23.361 --> 29:24.885
Why'd you let her off the bus?

29:24.963 --> 29:28.865
I didn't want to. It was really dark.
She could barely stand up.

29:28.933 --> 29:32.164
- Then Monte wanted her off?
- He was pissed off. She was crying.

29:32.237 --> 29:34.137
- Eddie!
- He was gonna fire me if I didn't.

29:34.205 --> 29:36.799
<i>We owe Monte a lot, okay?</i>
<i>The guy's been really good to us.</i>

29:36.875 --> 29:38.809
And we knew that
none of us killed her.

29:38.877 --> 29:42.574
If you let her off the bus in the middle of nowhere
in that condition, you may as well have.

29:42.647 --> 29:46.048
When Eddie told me where she got off
the bus, I went back and looked for her.

29:46.117 --> 29:49.553
<i>I must have driven that road for an hour.</i>
<i>I figured she hitched a ride back.</i>

29:49.621 --> 29:51.350
You figured? He figured.

29:51.422 --> 29:53.788
<i>Maybe Monte made a bad call</i>
<i>in letting the girl off.</i>

29:53.858 --> 29:56.520
But she wanted off.
So he was just doing what she asked.

29:56.594 --> 30:00.758
- Except for the sex part.
- You know what? You can't prove that.

30:00.832 --> 30:03.266
I wouldn't bet against her.

30:05.069 --> 30:08.061
- So, is Monte still in his office?
- No.

30:08.139 --> 30:11.233
He, uh, had an appointment
back at the Iguana Club up in Maryland.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.243
Okay.

30:19.884 --> 30:22.876
[Sighs]
You know what? I'm in America. We're men.

30:22.954 --> 30:24.888
Let's drink coffee, not tea, eh?

30:24.956 --> 30:26.890
Oh, I say.

30:26.958 --> 30:29.358
- You're doing a marvelous job.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

30:31.596 --> 30:33.689
[Exhales]
That's not coffee.

30:33.765 --> 30:37.758
- Oh. What is it?
- I don't know what the hell it is,
but it sure isn't coffee.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.304
You tend to do things well,
don't you?

30:40.371 --> 30:44.899
- Make coffee, build barbecue machines.
- It's not really a machine.

30:44.976 --> 30:48.742
Solve crimes, raise a son,
love women, leave women.

30:48.813 --> 30:51.907
Whatever you aim at,
you hit.

30:51.983 --> 30:55.214
- Is that bad?
- By no means. No, of course not.

30:55.286 --> 30:58.346
- Except...
- Oh, yeah, okay. Here we go.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.357
Let me have it, Doc.

31:00.425 --> 31:03.724
Except it is indicative of a need
to control your environment.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.729
Again, I ask, uh, is that bad?

31:05.797 --> 31:08.061
No, of course not.
No. Except...

31:08.132 --> 31:10.623
- Except?
- Except when you shoot a clown.

31:10.702 --> 31:14.103
You know, you make it sound like he was
walking around making balloon animals.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.436
For the most part,
your rebellions are small.

31:17.508 --> 31:21.604
- Rebellions?
- Mmm, the colorful socks, the funky belt buckle.

31:21.679 --> 31:24.079
They're a mechanism.
Quiet rebellions.

31:24.148 --> 31:26.241
<i>A way of asserting</i>
<i>your personal control...</i>

31:26.317 --> 31:29.980
<i>over a homogenizing organization</i>
<i>like the F.B.I.</i>

31:30.054 --> 31:32.079
But shooting a clown
is not a quiet rebellion.

31:32.156 --> 31:36.388
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- Shooting a clown is, quite literally, deafening.

31:36.461 --> 31:38.486
- Booth.
- [Brennan] Hey, it's me.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.498
Hold on. Why is it every time
I answer the phone, you walk away?

31:41.566 --> 31:45.332
Why do you answer the phone
knowing it'll make me walk away?

31:45.403 --> 31:47.598
Yeah, you know what?
Bones, I gotta call you back.

31:47.672 --> 31:50.300
Well, I... Is...
Is Sully for real?

31:50.375 --> 31:53.367
- What?
- I just can't decide whether or not
to take him seriously.

31:53.444 --> 31:57.642
- Is he acting unprofessional?
- No. He's... He's very professional.

31:57.715 --> 32:00.445
It's just... Can he really do
all he says he can do?

32:00.518 --> 32:02.645
Oh, you mean that whole
master carpentry thing, yeah.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.348
- What?
- Well, he made me a dining room set last year.

32:05.423 --> 32:08.654
- He's a carpenter as well?
- As well as what?

32:08.726 --> 32:11.160
- <i>[Beeping]</i>
- That's Sully calling right now.

32:11.229 --> 32:15.529
We're, um... We're doing,
you know, what we did.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.228
- You know, I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

32:18.303 --> 32:21.966
- I'll talk to you later.
- [Beeps]

32:27.278 --> 32:31.044
So maybe Monte can tell us why
he left the girl on the side of the road.

32:31.115 --> 32:35.108
Hey, there's a storefront.
Sausage and pepper shop?

32:35.186 --> 32:37.746
That's funny. Take my lead.

32:37.822 --> 32:42.054
- I know what I'm doing. Didn't Booth tell you?
- Yeah. Take my lead.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.094
Wait, wait, wait.
That's his car.

32:48.266 --> 32:50.393
Monte Gold?

33:13.758 --> 33:17.216
<i>[Sully] We found him in a pool of</i>
<i>his own blood outside his club.</i>

33:17.295 --> 33:20.025
It's the last thing
you said to Monte, Isaac.

33:20.098 --> 33:23.898
"His judgment cometh
and that right soon."

33:23.968 --> 33:25.902
That's not even a Bible verse,
the judgment thing.

33:25.970 --> 33:29.565
- It's a line from <i>Shawshank.</i>
- Who's that?

33:29.640 --> 33:32.268
<i>"Vengeance is mine," saith the Lord.</i>

33:32.343 --> 33:35.642
Look, if Monte's wicked deeds
cost him his life...

33:35.713 --> 33:38.978
<i>it was the work of a hand</i>
<i>far mightier than my own.</i>

33:39.050 --> 33:42.952
<i>And where exactly have your hands been</i>
<i>the last five hours?</i>

33:43.021 --> 33:45.546
Working on my truck.
I got garage receipts to prove it.

33:45.623 --> 33:49.081
- [Phone Rings]
- [Beeps]

33:49.160 --> 33:52.891
- Hey, Angela, what's up?
- Hey. I, uh...

33:52.964 --> 33:55.728
- I think that you might have the wrong man.
- What do you mean?

33:57.268 --> 34:00.066
I made a mistake, Brennan.

34:05.176 --> 34:07.974
<i>I only wanted to scare him.</i>

34:08.045 --> 34:10.639
I didn't go there to kill him.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.974
But what he said.

34:16.054 --> 34:21.856
Three words.
He only said three words in his defense.

34:25.663 --> 34:27.790
"She wanted it."

34:27.864 --> 34:30.697
She didn't, Mr. Dowd.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.202
<i>That much we do know.</i>

34:34.272 --> 34:36.263
Is there anyone
you want to call, sir?

34:38.208 --> 34:40.905
No. There isn't anybody.

34:42.213 --> 34:46.081
[Sighs]
There was Judy.

34:47.217 --> 34:49.152
JustJudy.

34:57.562 --> 35:02.295
<i>So this is the culprit, huh? The result</i>
<i>of your metal screw-headed thingy?</i>

35:03.367 --> 35:05.835
Zack managed to <i>identify</i>
this bone bruise.

35:05.903 --> 35:07.700
<i>Across posterior</i>
<i>six through eight.</i>

35:07.772 --> 35:10.366
- Show off.
- Okay.

35:10.441 --> 35:14.571
I've got my weapons list and visual aids,
courtesy of Angela.

35:14.645 --> 35:18.877
Now, we know the wound was caused by a blunt
steel dowel with screw threads at the top.

35:18.950 --> 35:22.317
The bruising around it is the rough
size and shape of a harmonica.

35:22.386 --> 35:25.913
<i>Theoretically, the head of the wound struck,</i>
<i>leaving the bruising, but then broke.</i>

35:25.990 --> 35:29.824
Allowing the steel dowel beneath
to be driven intoJudy's back.

35:29.894 --> 35:32.192
So possible weapons include...

35:32.263 --> 35:34.629
shovel handle with a steel shaft...

35:34.699 --> 35:39.500
- a golfer's wooden putter with aluminum shaft.
- Okay. A gear shifter?

35:39.570 --> 35:42.198
It's an alloy gear shifter
with a grip-shaped handle.

35:42.273 --> 35:44.298
This doesn't look like
it could cause the injury.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.536
Unless it didn't have a handle.

35:46.611 --> 35:49.171
<i>Yeah. Though she probably would not</i>
<i>have been killed standing up.</i>

35:49.247 --> 35:52.876
She'd have to have been
thrown down and then impaled.

35:58.122 --> 36:00.181
Preacher man had one of these
in his truck.

36:01.392 --> 36:03.485
With a tennis ball
where the handle should've been...

36:03.561 --> 36:05.961
hiding the exposed threads
underneath.

36:06.030 --> 36:08.362
And he follows Monte everywhere.

36:16.040 --> 36:18.167
<i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>

36:22.780 --> 36:24.645
Don't let us interrupt you, Isaac.

36:24.715 --> 36:28.617
<i>I was praying for his guidance</i>
<i>in bringing an end to this harassment.</i>

36:28.686 --> 36:30.984
- Well, he can't answer them all, can he?
- I'm tired of...

36:31.055 --> 36:33.990
- Where were you headed?
- Home. If that's any of your business.

36:34.058 --> 36:36.583
<i>Back to your church, huh?</i>
<i>I gotta tell ya.</i>

36:36.661 --> 36:38.629
I wish I'd have called them
a little sooner.

36:38.696 --> 36:42.564
- You did this? You called them?
- Yeah. You sure you weren't
headed back to Florida?

36:42.633 --> 36:45.898
<i>Stop along Alligator Alley,</i>
<i>make sure you left nothing behind?</i>

36:45.970 --> 36:47.904
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

36:47.972 --> 36:51.931
Well, apparently your church kicked
your hypocritical ass out last year.

36:52.009 --> 36:54.773
<i>Something about you hitting on</i>
<i>young female parishioners.</i>

36:54.845 --> 36:58.838
<i>Who-Who-Who... Who told you this, huh?</i>
<i>Hey, you can't get in there.</i>

36:58.916 --> 37:02.010
- Tennis ball for a gear shifter.
- Huh.

37:12.763 --> 37:15.755
- <i>Turn around, Isaac.</i>
- All right.

37:15.833 --> 37:18.324
Forgive them, Lord,
for they know not what they do.

37:18.402 --> 37:21.098
Oh, yeah?
Well, what we do know...

37:21.172 --> 37:24.972
is thatJudy Dowd was left
drunk and stumbling on Route 75.

37:25.042 --> 37:27.943
And you, following Monte's bus,
pulled over to give her a ride.

37:28.012 --> 37:29.639
Not a free one apparently.

37:29.714 --> 37:31.944
No, no. That's a lie.
I never even saw her.

37:32.016 --> 37:35.474
Oh, so this isn't her blood here?
It's someone's blood.

37:35.553 --> 37:37.612
How many of Monte's castoffs
have you been with?

37:37.688 --> 37:39.553
Huh? Girls too drunk to know?

37:39.624 --> 37:42.616
- Before you picked upJudy?
- <i>You went for it. She rejected you.</i>

37:42.693 --> 37:44.786
Next thing you know,
she's impaled on the shifter.

37:48.132 --> 37:50.225
I may have picked her up.

37:50.301 --> 37:54.169
But if I laid a hand, it was to heal
and to ask his redemption upon her.

37:54.238 --> 37:57.730
Oh, man. You are shameless.

37:57.808 --> 38:02.643
She was drunk. She went crazy.
Pushed me away and fell back.

38:02.713 --> 38:05.910
It was an accident.
You know, the devil's work.

38:05.983 --> 38:09.180
No. No. That was the part
where you fed her to an alligator.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.996
There should be a sense of satisfaction
after solving a case.

38:21.065 --> 38:27.026
But... most of the time,
I just... I feel drained.

38:27.104 --> 38:31.473
Yeah. That's why you can only
do this job for so long.

38:31.542 --> 38:33.737
Murders, death, corpses.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.802
You do that
your whole life and...

38:36.814 --> 38:39.544
There's gotta be more,
you know?

38:39.617 --> 38:41.551
The sausage and pepper sandwich.

38:41.619 --> 38:43.416
You gotta admit,
it was good.

38:43.487 --> 38:46.012
[Both Chuckle]

38:46.090 --> 38:48.786
So what do you and Booth
usually do now?

38:48.859 --> 38:53.125
Is there a bar you go to?
A restaurant? Pilates class?

38:53.197 --> 38:55.893
- There's a diner.
- Ah.

38:55.966 --> 38:58.366
Booth says the pie is the best.

38:58.436 --> 39:03.100
- Can I buy you a slice?
- Sure.

39:03.174 --> 39:07.975
- I guess we're not working together anymore.
- Yes.

39:08.045 --> 39:10.639
And since we have no professional
obligations to each other...

39:10.715 --> 39:12.649
I can ask you out...

39:14.118 --> 39:15.642
theoretically.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.086
Theoretically.

39:18.155 --> 39:22.888
- Perhaps after a 24-hour waiting period.
- Why?

39:22.960 --> 39:26.589
So the brain can adjust
to alternate perceptions of each other.

39:27.965 --> 39:31.560
I don't actually need it.
My brain adjusts quite quickly.

39:37.241 --> 39:39.209
[Sighs]

39:40.211 --> 39:42.270
[Chuckles]

39:42.346 --> 39:46.510
- Oh, my good Lord.
- That's right.

39:46.584 --> 39:49.109
How many bricks
did you use in the end?

39:49.186 --> 39:51.654
Yep. You know, 180.

39:51.722 --> 39:54.282
Right? So you can go sign away.

39:54.358 --> 39:58.488
- What are those?
- Oh, those are two beautiful prime rib-eye steaks.

39:58.562 --> 40:02.692
All right, being the barbecue master that I am,
I thought I'd show you how to barbecue, Doc.

40:02.767 --> 40:05.998
Oh, but I don't want to be shown.
I want to learn by trial and error.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.004
No, no, no, Doc. Come on, listen.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.506
It's better to learn off of
hamburgers or sausages.

40:10.574 --> 40:13.065
You know, those puppies
cost 50 bucks a pop.

40:13.144 --> 40:17.979
Hmm. You know,
according to the F.B.I. reports...

40:18.048 --> 40:21.643
there was no way you
could save Epps's life.

40:21.719 --> 40:23.710
Your partner's report
says the same thing.

40:23.788 --> 40:27.155
An F.B.I. sniper on the opposite roof
saw everything through his scope.

40:27.224 --> 40:31.456
According to all witnesses,
you have nothing to feel guilty about.

40:31.529 --> 40:33.394
Yeah, so?

40:33.464 --> 40:36.024
So, why, in a fit of pique...

40:36.100 --> 40:39.968
did you endanger innocent people in a public
thoroughfare by discharging your firearm?

40:40.037 --> 40:42.562
[Lid Closes]

40:42.640 --> 40:45.507
I'm a good shot.
I didn't put anybody in danger.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.408
How many people have you killed?

40:49.480 --> 40:51.414
Lost count.

40:51.482 --> 40:54.747
Oh, you can remember 180 bricks,
but not how many lives you've taken?

40:58.055 --> 41:00.819
- Epps makes 50.
- Fifty what?

41:03.961 --> 41:06.088
- Fifty kills.
- But, Agent Booth, you didn't kill Epps.

41:06.163 --> 41:09.030
You tried to save him, remember?

41:09.099 --> 41:11.693
<i>Or perhaps I'd better</i>
<i>put it as a question.</i>

41:11.769 --> 41:14.932
Did Howard Epps slip from your grasp,
or did you release him?

41:21.178 --> 41:24.272
<i>Oh, come now, man.</i>
<i>It's a simple-enough question.</i>

41:24.348 --> 41:26.782
Was he indeed
your 50th kill?

41:26.851 --> 41:29.285
Or did you just happen
to be there when he died?

41:40.598 --> 41:42.532
I don't know.

41:42.600 --> 41:47.537
A man like you, in control
of every situation, and you don't know?

41:49.607 --> 41:51.973
I don't know. I...

41:53.677 --> 41:56.840
I had him,
and then I lost him.

41:56.914 --> 42:00.315
And-And... something happened
in between.

42:01.785 --> 42:03.719
I don't know.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.626
I believe you.

42:10.694 --> 42:15.324
<i>Because for a man like you to admit</i>
<i>you don't know, to relinquish control...</i>

42:15.399 --> 42:18.800
that could indeed argue
a disruption in your self-view...

42:18.869 --> 42:22.771
<i>that was large enough</i>
<i>to motivate you to shoot a clown.</i>

42:26.744 --> 42:29.679
[Inhales] Do you know?
I think we made marvelous progress.

42:29.747 --> 42:32.443
This is a place from which
we can certainly begin.

42:35.452 --> 42:38.444
You know what?
I've changed my mind.

42:41.525 --> 42:44.187
I would love you
to cook those steaks.

42:44.261 --> 42:46.923
[Exhales]

42:50.434 --> 42:52.368
I can do that.

42:54.438 --> 42:56.702
Medium rare,
please, Mr. G-man.

43:00.778 --> 43:03.338
I can do that.

43:47.758 --> 43:49.157
What's that mean?
