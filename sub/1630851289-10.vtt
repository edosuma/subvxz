-I don't hear that.
I don't hear...
-I got Mort.

07:39.184 --> 07:40.850
-I don't want to do this
anymore.
-Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...

07:40.944 --> 07:42.352
It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

07:42.370 --> 07:43.128
I was supposed to get
one of you guys.

07:43.279 --> 07:44.445

07:44.465 --> 07:46.372
Oh, Secret Santa stuff.
I got Mike.

07:46.525 --> 07:47.949

-Everybody shush!

<i> GENE:</i>
<i> It's not in Holiday.</i>

07:50.195 --> 07:51.528
It's not in Folk.
It's not in Funk.

07:51.546 --> 07:53.305
And why isn't there
a Holiday Funk Folk section?

07:53.532 --> 07:55.122
What kind of record store
is this?!

07:55.142 --> 07:56.549
Maybe we just ask
for some help?

07:56.702 --> 07:58.960
Hi. My brother wants to know
if you have this record.

07:59.037 --> 08:00.053
The moisture is just
tummy sweat.

08:00.222 --> 08:01.538
We were sharing body warmth.

<i> Percy McTinsel-Bud's</i>
<i> Tinsel Machine?</i>

08:03.633 --> 08:04.649
Never heard of it.

08:04.876 --> 08:06.710
Good news is, I guess
you already own it?

08:06.803 --> 08:10.155
-It's broken,
like all my dreams!
-Easy, Gene.

08:10.265 --> 08:11.472
Did you check
the Holiday section?

08:11.566 --> 08:14.067
Oh, your so-called
Holiday section? Yes.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.052
Who the hell is Bing Crosby?

08:16.071 --> 08:17.554
Sorry, I guess
we don't have it.

08:17.572 --> 08:18.830
Well, we did our best.

08:18.982 --> 08:20.499
No!

08:20.726 --> 08:22.075
-(groaning)
-Are you gonna be like this

08:22.227 --> 08:23.168
all through Christmas?

08:23.395 --> 08:24.744
Uh-huh.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.397
Please, what would you do if you
were looking for this record?

08:27.415 --> 08:28.840
How do we get another one?

08:28.992 --> 08:31.751
Well, I would go online, but
I assume you did that already.

08:31.903 --> 08:33.920
But, um, just for a joke,
pretend we didn't.

08:33.997 --> 08:35.013
What would you look up?

08:35.164 --> 08:36.497
Well, you'd go on Recordrooter.

08:36.517 --> 08:39.759
Hmm, it was released in 1973
by Toodle-Loo Records.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.503
But I'm not seeing any copies
for sale anywhere.

08:42.523 --> 08:46.082
GENE:
But it's a holiday classic.

08:46.175 --> 08:48.342
So there's just, like,
no more of them in the world?

08:48.362 --> 08:49.677
They're just gone?

08:49.696 --> 08:53.365
Well, yeah. I mean, some records
just kinda go away.

08:53.516 --> 08:56.034
And that's why you got to take
really good care

08:56.261 --> 08:58.019
of those special, rare albums.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.204
GENE:
No...!

08:59.355 --> 09:01.206
Well, I mean there are
some collectors

09:01.357 --> 09:02.874
who go deeper than Recordrooter.

09:03.026 --> 09:04.358
Try this guy. He's local,

09:04.378 --> 09:06.102
and he's a super-obsessive
collector.

09:06.195 --> 09:09.030
He once found a copy
of Pavarotti's novelty record,

09:09.107 --> 09:10.382
<i> Naughty Pavarotti.</i>

09:10.533 --> 09:11.383
Okay, I like it.

09:11.534 --> 09:12.884
Hey, do you guys
gift wrap here?

09:13.036 --> 09:15.536
-I guess we can.
-Teach me everything you know.

09:15.630 --> 09:16.704
-Tina, stop.
-Sorry.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.640
-Whoa, guys.
-(gasps)

09:20.118 --> 09:22.619
-Hey, Courtney.
Is your dad home?
-What?

09:22.637 --> 09:24.712
BOB:
So, I-I know you don't
want to know

09:24.731 --> 09:26.714
that I have Mike,
but do you think that somebody

09:26.733 --> 09:30.960
very much like Mike
might enjoy a throw pillow

09:31.129 --> 09:32.553
that looks like a wooden log?

09:32.647 --> 09:33.646
Bob, stop.

09:33.890 --> 09:36.132
It's not Out-Loud Santa,
it's Secret Santa.

09:36.151 --> 09:37.242
That's what makes it fun.

09:37.393 --> 09:38.468
It was even more fun
to not buy gifts

09:38.561 --> 09:40.078
for someone I don't know
that well.

09:40.229 --> 09:42.322
Also, now I'm worried about
disappointing our mailman

09:42.416 --> 09:44.324
-and maybe not getting
mail anymore.
-(phone ringing)

09:44.418 --> 09:45.491
-Bob's Burgers.
<i> -TEDDY: Bob!</i>

09:45.644 --> 09:46.659
Oh, hi, Teddy.

09:46.828 --> 09:48.995
Don't say my name,
don't tell Linda it's me.

09:49.147 --> 09:51.072
Okay, stranger I don't know.

09:51.166 --> 09:52.424
I can't find anything
to get Mort.

09:52.651 --> 09:54.500
I just keep seeing things
you and Linda would love.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.803
Is Teddy talking
about his Secret Santa?

09:56.913 --> 09:58.263
Tell him he's got to do it
on his own.

09:58.414 --> 09:59.413
-Come on, I'm dying over here.
-Um, I-I...

09:59.433 --> 10:01.582
-Hanging up now.
-I hate this.

10:01.676 --> 10:02.767
-You love it.
-No.

10:02.994 --> 10:05.252
Hmm, I'm not familiar
with this album,

10:05.347 --> 10:06.754
but I know the label
Toodle-Loo Records.

10:06.923 --> 10:09.682
They're super small, they
didn't put out much, and, uh...

10:09.776 --> 10:11.759
Ugh, these lights are
so tangled, I can't tell

10:11.778 --> 10:13.278
if I'm making it worse
or better.

10:13.355 --> 10:15.171
It definitely looks
more tangled than before.

10:15.264 --> 10:17.190
This used to be
all nice and long.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.100
They're pretty, though.
I mean, I'm sure they're

10:19.119 --> 10:20.434
prettier when they're on.

10:20.528 --> 10:22.862
It's just, last year everyone
in this neighborhood

10:23.014 --> 10:25.123
started doing major
Christmas decorations.

10:25.274 --> 10:26.625
So we gave it a go,
and I thought

10:26.776 --> 10:30.111
we had a good display,
but we were way underlit.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.371
And somehow over-reindeered.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.189
I'm not going
through that again.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.966
It was a lot of reindeers, Dad.

10:35.118 --> 10:36.860
So, getting back
to the record...

10:36.878 --> 10:38.695
Do you know where we can
find a copy?

10:38.788 --> 10:40.287
Or do you know someone who knows
where we could find a copy?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.848
(gasps)
I do know someone.

10:41.958 --> 10:44.458
-What time is it in London?
-There's really no way to know.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.626
Uh, tea time?

10:45.795 --> 10:47.461
She helped me track down
<i> Naughty Pavarotti.</i>

10:47.555 --> 10:49.964
-Lot of buzz about that record.
-I know, right?

10:50.133 --> 10:51.891
So, yeah, if anyone can help me
track down

10:52.060 --> 10:54.135
a super rare, out of print
Toodle-Loo Records

10:54.262 --> 10:55.320
Christmas album, it's her.

10:55.471 --> 10:57.380
It's the most specific
superpower.

10:57.399 --> 10:59.382
Dad, I'm doing that part.

10:59.401 --> 11:01.993
Okay, but I'm just
gonna do it, uh, better.

11:02.145 --> 11:03.310
Oh, it's ringing.
(shudders)

11:03.330 --> 11:04.812
English ringtones,
they freak me out.

11:04.906 --> 11:07.573
(laughs):
Ah, hi, Alice. Doug Wheeler.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.483
Have I, uh, caught you
in the middle of anything, or...

11:09.577 --> 11:11.836
-Oh, you're having some tea.
-Yes.

11:12.063 --> 11:14.172
Uh, listen, I won't keep you.
Have you heard of a record

11:14.399 --> 11:17.158
called<i> Percy McTinsel-Bud's</i>
<i> Tinsel Machine?</i>

11:17.177 --> 11:18.568
-(all gasp)
-She's heard of it. Shh.

11:18.661 --> 11:20.845
Uh, listen I'm trying
to track down a copy.

11:21.072 --> 11:23.682
It's kind of an emergency
situation. Uh-huh.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.667
Uh-huh. Oh.
Oh, no. Okay.

11:26.761 --> 11:27.927
Well, then, I'll let you go.

11:28.096 --> 11:31.055
Thanks. Or cheers. Ta-ta?
Oh, you say "bye."

11:31.208 --> 11:33.507
So do I. I say bye.
Bye-- Bye.

11:33.601 --> 11:36.177
So, they pressed
very, very few copies,

11:36.271 --> 11:38.029
which only went out
to the band's fan club.

11:38.181 --> 11:39.756
And they had very few fans.

11:39.774 --> 11:42.183
Then there was a fire at the
Toodle-Loo Records warehouse.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.260
No one died,
but if there were any copies

11:44.279 --> 11:47.205
of the record in there,
uh, yeah, they died.

11:47.356 --> 11:49.282
So... we're getting closer?

11:49.434 --> 11:50.742
That copy of the
Percy McTinsel-Bud

11:50.894 --> 11:53.712
that you are holding could be
the last physical copy

11:53.863 --> 11:56.289
on this blue marble
we call Earth.

11:56.441 --> 11:58.791
-And you said you broke it,
right?
-(crying out)

11:58.944 --> 12:00.868
-(groaning)
-Aw, my sweet Gene.

12:00.962 --> 12:04.222
Do you want a piece of cheese?
Want some salami?

12:04.373 --> 12:06.707
-Oh, do you want me to go DJ
for a little while?
-No.

12:06.727 --> 12:10.044
I never want to hear
any holiday music ever again.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.545
(gasps)
You don't mean that.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.140
He didn't even say anything
about the cheese and the salami.

12:14.292 --> 12:15.400
I know. I'm really scared.

12:15.627 --> 12:17.218
Seems like Gene's got
to get his moans out.

12:17.295 --> 12:19.571
Should we, uh,
leave him to it?

12:19.798 --> 12:23.149
I have a bad, stupid idea
that I don't even want to say,

12:23.243 --> 12:24.650
but I don't know
what else to do.

12:24.803 --> 12:25.910
-Tickle party?
-No.

12:26.062 --> 12:28.805
We recreate
Percy McTinsel-Bud ourselves?

12:28.898 --> 12:30.498
Oh. But also tickle party?

12:34.829 --> 12:36.479
So you're saying
you want us to record

12:36.572 --> 12:38.498
Gene's terrible Christmas album
ourselves from memory?

12:38.592 --> 12:41.150
I said it was dumb,
but what's our alternative?

12:41.244 --> 12:43.595
Mopey Claus in there
is gonna ruin Christmas.

12:43.746 --> 12:45.412
I think it's a good idea.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.915
I mean, we all know the songs,
since he played them a lot,

12:47.934 --> 12:49.416
every day.

12:49.511 --> 12:50.176
But how do we do it
without Gene knowing?

12:50.328 --> 12:51.770
He lives here so much.

12:51.997 --> 12:53.830
Also, we don't play
any instruments,

12:53.923 --> 12:54.755
and we don't sing.

12:54.775 --> 12:58.001
♪<i> I beg your pardon?</i> ♪

12:58.019 --> 12:59.335
Okay, fine.

12:59.428 --> 13:01.613
I don't think it's gonna work,
but it's either this

13:01.764 --> 13:03.339
or we have to put Gene down.

13:03.358 --> 13:04.890
Because the kid is
really suffering.

13:05.043 --> 13:06.284
We could do it tomorrow
in the restaurant

13:06.511 --> 13:07.786
when there's no customers.

13:07.862 --> 13:10.271
-Which is something
that happens a lot.
-Louise.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.514
We just need to figure out

13:11.607 --> 13:13.516
how to get Gene out
of the house.

13:13.535 --> 13:16.202
-Maybe some kind of zip line?
Those are fun.
-(phone rings)

13:16.296 --> 13:18.187
Hello. Oh, hi, Courtney.

13:18.281 --> 13:19.522
I don't know if Gene can come
to the phone

13:19.615 --> 13:20.948
right now. He's moaning.

13:21.117 --> 13:23.543
I just wanted to let him know
he left his retainer here.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.619
<i> Uh, Gene doesn't wear</i>
<i> a retainer, honey.</i>

13:25.639 --> 13:29.140
Okay... then someone's
throwing retainers in our yard.

13:29.367 --> 13:31.125
Oh, Mom, let me talk to her.

13:31.961 --> 13:34.053
So I guess I'm going
to Courtney's now

13:34.205 --> 13:36.147
because she was
weirdly insistent that I help

13:36.299 --> 13:38.541
her and her dad hang up
Christmas lights?

13:38.634 --> 13:39.818
But all I want to do
is lie on the floor

13:39.969 --> 13:41.544
and think about how nothing
gold can stay.

13:41.637 --> 13:46.215
Go, Gene. You'll have a great
time hanging up lights...

13:46.309 --> 13:47.308
Yeah. Electricity is... amazing.

13:47.402 --> 13:50.386
And Courtney and Doug
are so fun.

13:50.405 --> 13:51.663
You won't miss anything here.

13:51.814 --> 13:54.648
We'll just be watching Tina
while she keeps wrapping

13:54.668 --> 13:57.001
the same tissue box over
and over again.

13:57.153 --> 13:59.003
My creases are
getting crisper.

13:59.230 --> 14:00.487
Don't look at this one.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.840
Maybe I could use
that for my Secret Santa gift.

14:02.067 --> 14:03.508
Bob, no. $15.

14:03.735 --> 14:06.493
-But those are the good tissues.
They're so soft.
-Uh-uh.

14:06.571 --> 14:08.513
-Okay, Gene, come on.
-Fine, I'll go.

14:08.664 --> 14:11.349
But I won't have fun
because I'll never smile again.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.092
That's the spirit.
There you go.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.335
Okay, have fun. Love you, bye.

14:14.470 --> 14:15.912
You're great
and everything's normal.

14:15.930 --> 14:19.006

Shh-shh-shh.
He's coming.

-Hi.
-Hey, Gene.
-Hey.

15:43.168 --> 15:45.184
-Hi.
-What's happening?

15:45.261 --> 15:47.278
Did you guys all fart
on my pillow or something?

15:47.430 --> 15:50.673
What? No. I did that one time.

15:50.692 --> 15:51.932
Okay, Gene, here's the thing.

15:52.010 --> 15:53.767
We got Courtney to invite you
over today

15:53.787 --> 15:56.362
so we could make you... this.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.105
-I wrapped it. No big deal.
-Hmm?

15:58.199 --> 16:01.851
-We made you a tape
Of Percy McTinsel-Bud.
-Yeah.

16:01.944 --> 16:04.370
We sang all of your
favorite Christmas songs

16:04.464 --> 16:06.947
in the world, and we did
all the instruments.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.709
Not with instruments
but with our mouths.

16:09.861 --> 16:10.710
Uh-huh...

16:10.862 --> 16:11.544
And we didn't know
all the words,

16:11.638 --> 16:12.804
but you can barely tell.

16:12.955 --> 16:14.621
Unless you know all the words.
Which you do.

16:14.790 --> 16:16.957
But we couldn't call you
and ask you what they were

16:16.977 --> 16:18.217
'cause, surprise. (chuckles)

16:18.369 --> 16:20.870
Why don't you... play it?

player and yelled "No."
-Yup. Mm-hmm.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.991
-It was all Tina's idea.
-What?

16:33.142 --> 16:34.975
I'm sorry. You guys worked
so hard.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.995
Aah! First I destroy
the last piece of precious

16:37.222 --> 16:39.388
musical history that should have
been in whatever safe

16:39.482 --> 16:41.315
the League

16:41.334 --> 16:43.392
and then I make you guys feel
bad about trying

16:43.411 --> 16:46.987
to do something nice.
I just keep ruining Christmas!

16:47.081 --> 16:49.398
Oh, my Genie. What a Chris-mess.

16:49.417 --> 16:50.758
That gift wrapping,
though, right?

16:55.073 --> 16:56.497
Aw, we were dumb
to try to remake Gene's

16:56.516 --> 16:58.924
favorite Christmas album.
What are we, Moby?

16:59.019 --> 17:00.243
Should we go talk to him?

17:00.336 --> 17:02.245
Maybe we should just
give him some space.

17:02.338 --> 17:05.081
Wait. Are we sure our tape
isn't incredible?

17:05.099 --> 17:06.173
Don't answer that.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.918
Oh, Percy McTinsel-Bud.

17:08.936 --> 17:10.677
You were the best thing
about Christmas,

17:10.697 --> 17:12.697
and now you're gone forever.

17:12.924 --> 17:13.990
Hey, Gene.

17:15.109 --> 17:17.593
-Want some tinsel?
-Uh, sure.

17:17.612 --> 17:20.096
-So shiny.
-Yeah.

I don't want you to be so sad
about breaking the record, Gene.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.293
Well, I am. I'm sadder
than the teacup kitten

17:34.445 --> 17:36.387
who fell out of the teacup
and couldn't get back in.

17:36.539 --> 17:38.464
What about the tape
your family made?

17:38.558 --> 17:39.891
I couldn't listen to it.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.802
Them trying to redo that record
is like trying to paint

17:42.896 --> 17:44.954
the Sistine Chapel
with a bunch of gravy.

17:44.956 --> 17:47.548
How would it even stay up there?
It would just drip on everybody.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.793
I see what you mean about that
gravy, but I actually think

17:50.795 --> 17:53.220
it's pretty great that they
made that tape for you.

17:53.389 --> 17:55.815
Lots of songs are covers.
Covers are cool.

17:55.967 --> 17:57.833
-They are?
-Songs and blankets.

17:57.893 --> 18:00.636
Gene, for you, your family's
version might not be

18:00.729 --> 18:03.973
your favorite version, but maybe
someday you'll give the tape

18:03.991 --> 18:05.157
to your kids.

18:05.310 --> 18:06.642
And it'll be
their favorite version,

18:06.661 --> 18:08.160
'cause it'll be
the only one they know.

18:08.313 --> 18:10.404
And they can roll
over on it and break it,

18:10.423 --> 18:11.905
and then make their own tape.

18:11.925 --> 18:16.260
-The point is, the music keeps
going. You dig?
-Huh.

18:16.487 --> 18:18.596
Okay, I'm gonna head out.
And don't worry about me.

18:18.747 --> 18:19.913
Back where I come from,

18:19.933 --> 18:22.600
we're still keeping it
funky and skunky.

18:22.827 --> 18:26.086
-Heaven?
-No. The '70s!

18:26.164 --> 18:27.663
Bye, Percy. I love you.

18:27.756 --> 18:30.333
-(glass clinking)
-We have gathered here today

18:30.467 --> 18:33.002
for neighborhood
Secret Santa, baby.

18:33.004 --> 18:35.004
I just want to apologize
in advance for mine.

18:35.022 --> 18:37.356
Bob, shush.
Let's open our gifts!

18:37.450 --> 18:39.450
Oh, who am I kidding?
I just have to accept

18:39.602 --> 18:40.934
that I'm not good
at gift wrapping.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.286
You don't have to wrap
my present at all.

18:42.513 --> 18:43.770
Just make sure
it's really big.

18:43.865 --> 18:45.289
Tina, if it makes you feel
any better,

18:45.516 --> 18:47.032
I think "good" gift wrapping
always seems

18:47.127 --> 18:48.517
so cold and impersonal.

18:48.519 --> 18:50.277
I'd much rather get
a present wrapped like that.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.446
It seems more thoughtful
and interesting.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.039
Hey, thanks, Mike.
And you should know.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.449
You've seen a lot of packages.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.135
Because, you know,
you're a mailman.

18:57.286 --> 18:58.711
Yeah. I am a mailman.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.120
But that envelope probably
seems

19:00.140 --> 19:01.864
pretty thoughtful, too,
right?

19:01.883 --> 19:04.367
-Yeah.
-Sorry, it's a gift card.

19:04.385 --> 19:06.144
-From the heart?
-Hey, this is great.

19:06.295 --> 19:07.794
The Home Furnishings
Superstore.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.648
I love home furnishings.
And a superstore? (whistles)

19:10.799 --> 19:13.542
-Oh. Good.
-Aw, Mike, thanks
for the stamps!

19:13.636 --> 19:16.045
-How'd you know
they were from me?
-Just a lucky guess.

19:16.063 --> 19:17.804
Wait, Bob, what present
did you get?

19:17.824 --> 19:20.549
Uh, it's a note.
"I got the car washed."

19:20.568 --> 19:23.161
-Oh. Is this from Linda?
-Yeah, it is.

19:23.312 --> 19:25.721
-Thanks. This is perfect.
-TEDDY: Perfect.

19:25.814 --> 19:26.980
Yeah. Great.

19:27.074 --> 19:29.149
-Teddy, open yours.
-Fine.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.576
Oh... It's a--

19:30.670 --> 19:33.171
A little plaque that says
"Teddy." For your, uh, stool.

19:33.398 --> 19:34.914
I figured since you have
a favorite stool here,

19:35.008 --> 19:37.066
maybe Bob and Linda could
put your name on it.

19:37.084 --> 19:38.751
-Aw.
-Oh, uh, I-I don't think we...
-Wow.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.513
Mort, this is, like, the best
gift anyone's ever gotten me.

19:42.665 --> 19:45.165
Now I feel bad about
the calendar I got you.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.576
Pictures of old barns?
I'm a total barn nut.

19:47.595 --> 19:51.080
Barns, bridges, I think they got
some fences in there, too.

19:51.173 --> 19:52.857
Bob! A plaque for my stool.

19:53.008 --> 19:55.676
-Should we put it right here?
-Uh, yeah, maybe.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.679
Or, oh, uh, under the seat
might be a good spot.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.347
Like a fun, hidden thing?

20:00.366 --> 20:02.033
I love that, that's great.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.276
I love Secret Santa!

20:04.429 --> 20:06.871
-I'm gonna go get my tools
in the truck.

20:07.022 --> 20:08.264
Oh, excuse me, elf.

20:08.357 --> 20:09.598
Aw, Genie, you came
out of your room.

20:09.692 --> 20:11.951
And you're in
your deejaying outfit.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.769
Mother, Father, sisters,

20:13.788 --> 20:16.047
I listened to the tape
you made me. All of it.

20:16.198 --> 20:18.107
And it's really great.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.217
You don't have to say that.

20:19.368 --> 20:20.960
Yeah. Music's a lot
harder to do

20:21.054 --> 20:22.111
when you're not good at it.

20:22.129 --> 20:23.054
We know that now.

20:23.205 --> 20:24.280
No! You did the right thing.

20:24.298 --> 20:25.723
The music isn't gone.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.950
This is Percy McTinsel-Bud now.

20:27.969 --> 20:30.119
It just needed a little, uh,
touching up.
