Announcer:
<i>Previously,</i>
<i>it was sink or swim...</i>

00:04.810 --> 00:07.081
Our lifeguards are arriving.

00:07.081 --> 00:10.655
<i>when the Top 19 faced</i>
<i>their first team challenge.</i>

00:10.655 --> 00:12.759
‐ Woo!
‐ <i>Brien's Red Team...</i>

00:12.759 --> 00:14.997
Gordon:
Congratulations. Well done.

00:14.997 --> 00:17.201
<i>navigated their way</i>
<i>to victory,</i>

00:17.201 --> 00:18.804
‐ <i>leaving Paige...</i>
‐ What do you think?

00:18.804 --> 00:20.307
I would not want to eat it.

00:20.307 --> 00:22.846
<i>to sink to the bottom</i>
<i>of the pressure test.</i>

00:25.952 --> 00:29.058
<i>Tonight,</i>

00:29.058 --> 00:31.530
<i>a mystery box challenge</i>
<i>that's alive...</i>

00:31.530 --> 00:32.799
Eboni:
Oh, God.

00:32.799 --> 00:34.135
<i>and kicking.</i>

00:34.135 --> 00:36.306
‐ <i>And then...</i>
‐ Watch and learn.

00:36.306 --> 00:39.011
<i>a Gordon Ramsay master class</i>
<i>leads to an elimination...</i>

00:39.011 --> 00:41.215
What do I need?
A ( bleep ) straw?

00:41.215 --> 00:43.353
<i>that's hard to swallow.</i>

00:43.353 --> 00:45.190
‐ ( coughs )
‐ ( gasps )

00:56.747 --> 00:58.584
Woohoo!

00:58.584 --> 01:02.024
‐ All right,
let's do this.
‐ Let's go!

01:02.024 --> 01:04.963
Newton:
<i>I came to MasterChef</i>
<i>to show these young kids</i>

01:04.963 --> 01:06.533
that this old guy
has some spunk in him,

01:06.533 --> 01:07.902
<i>and it's been a great ride.</i>

01:07.902 --> 01:10.207
<i>I rodeo'ed my way</i>
<i>to the Top 18,</i>

01:10.207 --> 01:11.844
sent some people packing
like I promised.

01:11.844 --> 01:14.583
You've already come a long,
long way to get here,

01:14.583 --> 01:18.891
but, trust me,
this competition
is just getting started.

01:18.891 --> 01:20.928
Because it's time
to be tested yet again

01:20.928 --> 01:24.201
in your next big
mystery box challenge.

01:27.374 --> 01:29.713
Are you ready to find out
what you have to work with?

01:29.713 --> 01:31.550
All: Yes, Chef.

01:31.550 --> 01:34.221
All right,
on the count of three,

01:34.221 --> 01:35.725
you will lift
those boxes.

01:35.725 --> 01:39.031
One, two, three.

01:39.031 --> 01:40.868
Lift.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.908
( squealing, laughing )

01:43.908 --> 01:48.450
‐ We got a live one!
‐ Shut up. Oh!

01:48.450 --> 01:52.291
In your box, you have some
of the finest shellfish
the world has to offer,

01:52.291 --> 01:56.600
including
Pacific sea urchin,
soft‐shell crabs,

01:56.600 --> 01:59.940
clams,
green‐lipped mussels,

01:59.940 --> 02:02.010
beautiful geoduck,

02:02.010 --> 02:06.520
and one of my favorites,
Santa Barbara spot prawns.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.024
I grew up in New England.
I love seafood.

02:09.024 --> 02:10.895
<i>These are things</i>
<i>that speak to who I am</i>

02:10.895 --> 02:13.634
and I just love
all little clammies.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.239
This challenge is
totally made for me.

02:16.239 --> 02:18.143
<i>Oh, my gosh,</i>
<i>this is amazing.</i>

02:18.143 --> 02:20.882
Win this challenge,
and you will get

02:20.882 --> 02:24.288
a huge advantage
moving forward.

02:24.288 --> 02:26.459
You'll have
60 minutes to make us

02:26.459 --> 02:28.931
the absolute best
shellfish dish

02:28.931 --> 02:30.568
of your entire lives.

02:30.568 --> 02:34.776
Your 60 minutes starts...

02:34.776 --> 02:37.816
‐ now! Let's go!
‐ Woohoo!

02:37.816 --> 02:38.851
Let's go.

02:43.092 --> 02:46.098
Right now, guys,
look at this beautiful
array of shellfish.

02:46.098 --> 02:48.102
Now, I have a confession.

02:48.102 --> 02:50.340
The sea urchin
has to be my favorite.

02:50.340 --> 02:51.677
And you have to open
the sea urchin

02:51.677 --> 02:53.179
with such delicacy.

02:53.179 --> 02:55.551
Man, gonna have to go
with something a little
more heavy duty.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.822
I'll be so excited
if anyone works with that.

02:57.822 --> 03:01.262
What I'm very
excited about is these
Santa Barbara spot prawns.

03:01.262 --> 03:03.433
But they're very tricky.
You've gotta remove the head,

03:03.433 --> 03:05.938
because if you don't do that,
the flesh becomes mealy.

03:08.176 --> 03:12.251
Now, one of the stranger
shellfish out here tonight
is the geoduck clam.

03:12.251 --> 03:16.025
Just to get into this geoduck
you need to blanch it
for a few seconds.

03:16.025 --> 03:19.498
Boiling water,
then cold water,
make sure it's rinsed out.

03:19.498 --> 03:21.503
Slice it thin.
Doesn't need a lot.

03:21.503 --> 03:23.206
Maybe some salt,
some lemon juice,
some olive oil.

03:23.206 --> 03:25.377
My big question to you guys,
anyone going to have
the balls tonight

03:25.377 --> 03:27.214
to actually work
with one of those things?

03:29.285 --> 03:33.026
God. It can't
be jumping around.
How do I kill it?

03:33.026 --> 03:34.061
Grab the head.
Rip it off.

03:34.061 --> 03:35.631
Pretend it was
cheatin' on you.

03:35.631 --> 03:38.069
The dish that I'm making
is called jeweled dumplings.

03:38.069 --> 03:40.675
It's going to have geoduck
and spotted prawn

03:40.675 --> 03:44.716
and mushrooms cooked in
a Cantonese pepper sauce.

03:44.716 --> 03:48.991
My dad's from Hong Kong,
so I'm going to fry it
in the Cantonese style.

03:48.991 --> 03:50.160
This is a difficult dish.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.495
I'm making my own
dumpling skin,

03:51.495 --> 03:53.867
and so I'm really
pulling out my A game.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.170
I'm getting there.

03:59.078 --> 04:01.850
I am doing fried
soft‐shell crab,

04:01.850 --> 04:04.622
uni butter,
with a corn cake.

04:04.622 --> 04:06.860
I grew up fishing‐‐
a huge tomboy.

04:06.860 --> 04:10.033
I'm a nutritionist,
so I absolutely love seafood,

04:10.033 --> 04:13.172
and just really excited
to work with something
that's so fresh.

04:13.172 --> 04:14.709
Oh, no, no.

04:14.709 --> 04:16.345
Coming from
an Italian household,

04:16.345 --> 04:17.849
I really know how
to make pastas.

04:17.849 --> 04:19.552
It's how I won
this apron right here.

04:19.552 --> 04:22.224
So, we are going to do
a sea urchin pasta,

04:22.224 --> 04:27.000
some mussels
with a little bit
of our chard,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.708
and then we're going
to be roasting up a couple
of our shrimp here.

04:30.708 --> 04:34.682
Guys, just under
30 minutes to go!

04:34.682 --> 04:36.385
‐ You okay, Jethro?
‐ Oh, yeah.

04:36.385 --> 04:37.387
This is up your alley,
isn't it?

04:37.387 --> 04:39.692
This is mine to lose
right now.

04:39.692 --> 04:42.064
‐ All right, Jeff.
‐ Hello. How are we today?

04:42.064 --> 04:44.368
Now, you look like
you are setting yourself
up for success.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.704
I'm ready. I'm prepping
everything so that way‐‐

04:45.704 --> 04:47.240
‐ This is a beautiful board.
‐ Thank you so very much.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.710
What do you got going on?

04:48.710 --> 04:50.280
I'm going to bring in
a little bit of Spanish flavor.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.716
We're going to do
a sautéed mussel dish

04:51.716 --> 04:53.787
with a little bit
of chorizo sausage,

04:53.787 --> 04:56.459
and we're also going
to do a nice little bit
of Shrimp al Ajillo,

04:56.459 --> 04:57.795
so it's going to be
jam‐packed with that flavor.

04:57.795 --> 04:59.566
and a tribute
to my hometown in Tampa.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.835
Tell me a little bit
about your family life.

05:00.835 --> 05:02.672
Well, I've got
an incredible fiancée,

05:02.672 --> 05:05.243
who sacrifices everything
so that way I can be living
out my dream right now,

05:05.243 --> 05:07.347
and raising our little boy,

05:07.347 --> 05:10.420
who is just
three months old today.

05:10.420 --> 05:13.092
And this is my tribute
to my little boy,

05:13.092 --> 05:15.531
and I want
to make him proud.

05:15.531 --> 05:18.035
When you cook from that place,
usually great things happen.

05:18.035 --> 05:20.708
I love the passion.
Good luck.

05:20.708 --> 05:22.712
Thank you so very much,
you two.

05:22.712 --> 05:25.083
Get a little bit
of some fat.

05:26.987 --> 05:28.289
‐ Jason.
‐ Hello, Chef Ramsay.

05:28.289 --> 05:30.326
‐ How are you doing?
‐ Doing very well, thank you.

05:30.326 --> 05:32.899
The look on your face,
when you unveiled that box
was like Christmas Day.

05:32.899 --> 05:35.069
It's beautiful.
All the shellfish
is just really‐‐

05:35.069 --> 05:37.073
thank you so much
for providing something
so wonderful.

05:37.073 --> 05:38.844
‐ You're very welcome.
‐ I appreciate it.

05:38.844 --> 05:40.246
Right, what's the dish?
What are you using?

05:40.246 --> 05:41.783
The clams,
I've created a quick stock.

05:41.783 --> 05:43.419
‐ There is ginger in here
‐ Smart.

05:43.419 --> 05:45.758
I have some of
the shrimp shells in there.

05:45.758 --> 05:48.262
I'm going to try
tempura spot prawns

05:48.262 --> 05:51.035
and I'd like to use some
of the richness of the uni.

05:51.035 --> 05:53.139
Working from a musical palate,
you know teaching orchestra,

05:53.139 --> 05:54.709
I'm working with
different instruments,

05:54.709 --> 05:56.345
just orchestrating
that and seeing how‐‐

05:56.345 --> 05:57.615
And you're the conductor.

05:57.615 --> 05:58.784
‐ Yes, I am.
‐ And I'm the taster.

05:58.784 --> 06:00.153
‐ I hope I can do you proud.
‐ Good luck.

06:00.153 --> 06:01.823
‐ Okay, thank you, Chef.
‐ Let's go.

06:01.823 --> 06:04.461
Guys, 15 minutes remaining.

06:04.461 --> 06:07.400
‐ All right, Newton!
‐ Yes, ma'am?

06:07.400 --> 06:11.175
As a Texan ranch owner,
where do you have experience

06:11.175 --> 06:12.645
working with these
ingredients?

06:12.645 --> 06:14.782
I love fresh seafood,
but, unfortunately,

06:14.782 --> 06:16.085
up in north Texan
ranch country,

06:16.085 --> 06:18.089
I have to go 100 miles
to get fresh fish.

06:18.089 --> 06:19.258
But just from things
I've heard,

06:19.258 --> 06:21.462
we'll do a little
Camarones de la Diablo,

06:21.462 --> 06:23.099
mussels as an appetizer.

06:23.099 --> 06:25.604
We'll have po'boy sandwich
with the soft‐shell crabs.

06:25.604 --> 06:27.842
So, your wife has been
a huge supporter of you, right?

06:27.842 --> 06:30.213
She's allowing you to kinda
be here doing your thing.

06:30.213 --> 06:34.989
Well, you know,
it's the beauty of my wife,
my kids, friends...

06:36.225 --> 06:38.630
allowing me this
beautiful trip here.

06:38.630 --> 06:41.368
And to be here and cook
and be in this experience?

06:41.368 --> 06:44.041
‐ There's nothing better.
‐ Let's taste that dream.

06:44.041 --> 06:45.711
‐ Thank you.
‐ Try to be that next
MasterChef.

06:45.711 --> 06:46.880
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ All right.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.249
Thank you very much.

06:49.484 --> 06:51.322
Can I get that
salt back, please?

06:51.322 --> 06:53.059
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

06:53.059 --> 06:55.531
Aarón:
All right, everyone,
10 minutes left

06:55.531 --> 06:57.400
for this beautiful dish,

06:57.400 --> 07:00.406
utilizing these
true jewels of the sea.

07:00.406 --> 07:03.045
I'm so impressed.
Jason, okay,

07:03.045 --> 07:05.851
‐ he is using, minimum,
four of the shellfish.
‐ What?

07:05.851 --> 07:08.857
He's opened
the sea urchin beautifully.
He's steaming the clams.

07:08.857 --> 07:10.193
He started a stock.

07:10.193 --> 07:11.362
He's flavored it
with bonito flakes.

07:11.362 --> 07:13.132
This guy seriously knows
what he's doing.

07:13.132 --> 07:14.669
Aarón:
We visited with Jeff,

07:14.669 --> 07:16.740
and he's going this
kind of Spanish route.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.510
He wants to do
Camarones al Ajillo‐‐

07:18.510 --> 07:21.148
kind of this traditional
kind of mussel dish,
tons of garlic.

07:21.148 --> 07:22.718
I'm going to go with
a little more garlic.

07:22.718 --> 07:25.423
He's got this deeper thing
that he's fighting for.

07:25.423 --> 07:26.993
He's got a three month
old at home.

07:26.993 --> 07:29.331
He's got a fiancée
that's holding down the fort.

07:29.331 --> 07:31.836
Aarón:
And, even Newton, big cowboy,
meat and potato guy,

07:31.836 --> 07:33.507
he got very emotional
when he started speaking

07:33.507 --> 07:35.009
about his family,
his children.

07:35.009 --> 07:37.180
So, he's really playing
for a lot here,

07:37.180 --> 07:40.019
and he's seizing
that by using three different
kinds of shellfish.

07:40.019 --> 07:41.856
‐ Come on.
‐ And he says he's not
familiar with it.

07:41.856 --> 07:45.363
‐ Newton: How much time?
‐ Last two minutes.

07:45.363 --> 07:48.269
This is where you
start to concentrate
on your plating.

07:48.269 --> 07:51.074
‐ It's there.
‐ There it is, baby.

07:51.074 --> 07:54.982
‐ Come on, guys, let's go!
‐ Saddle up, Newton. Yee‐haw!

07:54.982 --> 07:56.886
‐ Here we go!
‐ Get it on the plate.

07:56.886 --> 07:58.990
Ten, nine, eight,

07:58.990 --> 08:01.996
seven, six, five,

08:01.996 --> 08:05.002
four, three, two,

08:05.002 --> 08:06.338
‐ one.
‐ And stop.

08:06.338 --> 08:08.342
‐ Well done.
‐ Hands in the air.

08:13.553 --> 08:15.891
‐ Here we go!
‐ Get it on a plate.

08:15.891 --> 08:18.630
Five, four, three,

08:18.630 --> 08:21.536
two, one. That's it.

08:21.536 --> 08:23.707
‐ Hands up.
‐ Hands in the air.

08:23.707 --> 08:26.478
‐ Woo!
‐ Well done.

08:26.478 --> 08:27.715
Man, nice job, y'all.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.986
All right, we had a chance
to watch you cook

08:29.986 --> 08:33.325
and taste elements
from each of your dishes
as you put them together.

08:33.325 --> 08:36.131
Now, there are three
dishes out there

08:36.131 --> 08:38.803
that we can't wait
to take a closer look at.

08:38.803 --> 08:42.243
The first home cook
really took the idea
of the variety

08:42.243 --> 08:43.914
of shellfish
available to them

08:43.914 --> 08:45.751
and really took it
to the next level.

08:45.751 --> 08:47.120
Please step forward...

08:50.459 --> 08:52.096
Jeff, come down, please.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.837
Jeff:
<i>I'm the first name</i>
<i>that's called up.</i>

08:55.837 --> 08:57.675
<i>Everyone needs</i>
<i>to pay attention to Jeff.</i>

08:57.675 --> 08:59.177
<i>I'm in it to win it.</i>

08:59.177 --> 09:00.914
This is a tribute to Tampa.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.487
Jeff, describe
to me your dish.

09:04.487 --> 09:08.062
I did sautéed mussels
and chorizo with prawns
and garlic.

09:08.062 --> 09:09.665
Talk to me about the heads.

09:09.665 --> 09:12.136
I wanted that just
to be for a little bit
of presentation,

09:12.136 --> 09:14.474
and I really would like
for you to get a little bit
of that broth,

09:14.474 --> 09:16.411
that way there's
a little bit more
of that flavor to it.

09:18.282 --> 09:20.353
I enjoy the lightness
of the broth.

09:20.353 --> 09:24.294
I think it really is
accentuated by the shells
from the actual spot prawns.

09:24.294 --> 09:26.331
The green‐lipped mussels
are cooked perfectly.

09:26.331 --> 09:29.270
I think for me,
if I were to do
something different,

09:29.270 --> 09:30.774
‐ some Israeli couscous,
‐ Cool.

09:30.774 --> 09:33.278
or something in there
to soak up that broth.

09:33.278 --> 09:34.649
But the flavor
is definitely there.

09:34.649 --> 09:36.118
Thank you very much, Chef.

09:43.298 --> 09:45.537
Wow. Yeah,
that is delicious.

09:45.537 --> 09:48.042
Mussels are sweet
and the shrimp
are mind‐blowing.

09:48.042 --> 09:49.411
Love what you did
with the ingredients,

09:49.411 --> 09:50.681
because you let them
speak for themselves.

09:50.681 --> 09:52.083
You cooked them
the last minute,

09:52.083 --> 09:53.687
but you utilized
what else they delivered

09:53.687 --> 09:55.857
in terms of the stock,
the flavor, and the sweetness.

09:55.857 --> 09:57.695
Young man,
there's no stopping you
right now, is there?

09:57.695 --> 10:01.168
‐ Not at all.
‐ That is delicious.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.873
‐ Thank you.
‐ Well done.

10:03.873 --> 10:06.044
‐ Good job, Jeff.
‐ Way to go, Jeff.

10:07.881 --> 10:11.589
All right,
the second dish that
we want to examine further

10:11.589 --> 10:14.862
showcases an incredibly
impressive display

10:14.862 --> 10:16.566
of culinary technique.

10:16.566 --> 10:20.206
This home cook used
not one, not two,

10:20.206 --> 10:24.080
but three of the shellfish.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.755
Please step forward...

10:27.755 --> 10:29.558
Necco.

10:29.558 --> 10:31.261
Necco:
<i>This is my first time</i>
<i>in the top three,</i>

10:31.261 --> 10:33.499
<i>so the judges haven't really</i>
<i>gotten to know me yet.</i>

10:33.499 --> 10:34.935
<i>I've brought</i>
<i>my Southern roots,</i>

10:34.935 --> 10:36.739
<i>my Italian roots,</i>
<i>my French technique.</i>

10:36.739 --> 10:39.578
This mystery box is mine.

10:39.578 --> 10:41.582
All right, Necco,
what do you got?

10:41.582 --> 10:43.920
We have roasted spot prawns,

10:43.920 --> 10:46.659
a Southern version
of Mussels Casino,

10:46.659 --> 10:48.095
and an uni pasta.

10:48.095 --> 10:49.765
Awesome.

10:49.765 --> 10:51.936
Let's start
with the spot prawns.
How'd you season it?

10:51.936 --> 10:55.644
It was a quick poach
and then a roast in the oven
with garlic butter, parsley.

10:55.644 --> 10:56.946
I was also fortunate enough

10:56.946 --> 10:59.150
to find myself a female
with the roe still in it,

10:59.150 --> 11:02.089
and I figured that would be
a nice texture component.

11:03.927 --> 11:05.296
Pretty lovely
with that spot prawn.

11:05.296 --> 11:07.568
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Now, mussel.

11:07.568 --> 11:09.905
Looks like you kind of went
Clams Casino on me.

11:09.905 --> 11:11.742
A little bit.
It's a Southern version of it.

11:11.742 --> 11:14.080
Instead of spinach,
we went with Swiss chard.

11:15.082 --> 11:17.921
Wow.
Very smart preparation.

11:17.921 --> 11:19.792
Love that you went back
to Southern roots there.

11:19.792 --> 11:22.263
I think the Swiss
chard is delicious.
It's well seasoned.

11:22.263 --> 11:25.102
It pairs well with
the sweetness of that mussel.

11:25.102 --> 11:28.776
Listen, Necco,
if this is what you've
got under your belt,

11:28.776 --> 11:31.114
I'm excited to see what else
you've got up your sleeve.

11:31.114 --> 11:32.818
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Very nice job.

11:36.224 --> 11:37.961
Strong Italian roots, right?

11:37.961 --> 11:39.297
‐ You're proud of that?
‐ Absolutely. Yes, Chef.

11:39.297 --> 11:40.967
You've made fresh
tagliatelle before?

11:40.967 --> 11:44.207
No, Chef.
This is my first time
making this style of pasta.

11:44.207 --> 11:48.883
That tagliatelle,
with the sea urchin,
it's creamy, it's luscious,

11:48.883 --> 11:50.219
and the light coating
of butter and seasoning

11:50.219 --> 11:52.323
is really
something spectacular.

11:52.323 --> 11:54.260
If this is what
you've got,

11:54.260 --> 11:56.231
a desire to do
three preparations?

11:56.231 --> 11:58.503
Everybody there
should be taking notice.

11:58.503 --> 12:00.740
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Good job.

12:00.740 --> 12:02.276
Good job, Necco.

12:02.276 --> 12:04.782
‐ Good job.
‐ Nice job.

12:04.782 --> 12:07.521
The third and final dish,
this plate,

12:07.521 --> 12:11.996
it's packed with elements
all harmonizing beautifully.

12:11.996 --> 12:15.302
We really feel
that we can see

12:15.302 --> 12:17.206
this individual's
passion on the plate.

12:18.208 --> 12:20.513
Please step forward...

12:24.187 --> 12:27.426
‐ Jason.
‐ Yes.

12:27.426 --> 12:28.997
Jason:
<i>Growing up in New England,</i>

12:28.997 --> 12:31.334
<i>especially near the ocean,</i>
<i>I know my seafood.</i>

12:31.334 --> 12:33.673
<i>And the fact that these</i>
<i>beautiful ingredients are here,</i>

12:33.673 --> 12:35.242
it's like I've hit
the jackpot.

12:35.242 --> 12:37.179
<i>This is my mystery box</i>
<i>to win.</i>

12:37.179 --> 12:40.285
‐ Chefs.
‐ Right, young man,

12:40.285 --> 12:44.427
I've never seen
a smile so wide ever.

12:44.427 --> 12:47.601
This passion,
where does it come from?

12:47.601 --> 12:49.404
My parents
came from Taiwan

12:49.404 --> 12:51.909
and they really
didn't have much.

12:51.909 --> 12:55.717
And these ingredients,
they're things saved for
very special occasions,

12:55.717 --> 12:57.888
so I wanted to treat
them with respect.

12:57.888 --> 13:00.325
You certainly showed that,
let's get that right.

13:00.325 --> 13:01.829
Describe the dish.

13:01.829 --> 13:03.331
So, the dish
I have prepared today

13:03.331 --> 13:07.173
is a tempura spot prawn,
tempura‐ed bok choy leaves.

13:07.173 --> 13:10.179
The sauce is mayonnaise
with fresh uni and yuzu juice.

13:10.179 --> 13:13.351
And for here,
you have a delicious
broth of clams

13:13.351 --> 13:15.055
and the shells
from the spot prawns.

13:15.055 --> 13:19.030
There's ginger,
a little bit of scallion,
and Thai basil.

13:19.030 --> 13:21.267
There are bonito flakes
that I strained through there

13:21.267 --> 13:23.706
and there is a little bit
of white miso in there

13:23.706 --> 13:25.877
and there is some clams
kind of swimming
around in there.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.150
I ( bleep ) love you.

13:31.087 --> 13:34.895
That's what I call
60 minutes of effort.

13:34.895 --> 13:37.399
And you've got this
thin tempura batter.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.137
You can still see
the Santa Barbara spot prawn,
but you've gone beyond that.

13:39.137 --> 13:40.573
You've got mushroom‐‐
what else is in there?

13:40.573 --> 13:43.078
They are Maitake mushrooms‐‐
hen of the woods,

13:43.078 --> 13:45.149
and bok choy leaves
rolled with uni,

13:45.149 --> 13:47.419
and a little bit of mirugai‐‐
the giant clam.

13:49.423 --> 13:51.427
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

13:51.427 --> 13:53.365
I mean, it's a work of art.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.269
Thank you, Chef.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.439
You know,
I've never said this before,
but what would I change?

13:57.439 --> 14:00.547
Quite honestly? Nothing.

14:00.547 --> 14:02.551
‐ Great job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

14:11.835 --> 14:14.508
‐ That broth is
out of this world.
‐ Thank you.

14:14.508 --> 14:17.948
The layers, the flavor,
it makes you just want
to keep going back.

14:17.948 --> 14:20.085
The tempura reminds me
of every trip

14:20.085 --> 14:21.287
I've ever taken to Japan.

14:21.287 --> 14:24.260
It was delicious.
I love the zing of yuzu.

14:24.260 --> 14:27.601
You live it
and you breathe it,
this love for food,

14:27.601 --> 14:30.707
and you've cared so much
for every single one
of these ingredients.

14:30.707 --> 14:32.711
‐ Very nice job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

14:32.711 --> 14:36.619
‐ Nice job.
‐ Good job, Jason.

14:36.619 --> 14:38.823
‐ Nice job, buddy.
‐ You killed it, man.

14:38.823 --> 14:39.992
That's beautiful.

14:42.363 --> 14:44.333
You three, well done.
Jeff, Necco, Jason,

14:44.333 --> 14:46.204
you know there can
only be one winner.

14:46.204 --> 14:49.210
That winner will receive
a game‐changing advantage.

14:49.210 --> 14:52.817
The winning dish tonight...

14:52.817 --> 14:55.155
congratulations to...

14:57.159 --> 14:59.330
Jason.

14:59.330 --> 15:01.067
‐ Go Jason.
‐ Great job.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.606
Congratulations, dude!
Amazing.

15:03.606 --> 15:05.008
Nice job.
That's awesome.

15:05.008 --> 15:06.679
Young man,
how do you feel?

15:06.679 --> 15:08.816
Is this even real?
Am I here?

15:08.816 --> 15:11.187
Jason, you're now safe
from elimination.

15:11.187 --> 15:14.126
Please, take your well‐earned
position up there,

15:14.126 --> 15:15.295
safe on the balcony.

15:15.295 --> 15:16.865
Off you go. Well done.

15:16.865 --> 15:18.669
‐ Great job, Jason.
‐ Go, Jason!

15:18.669 --> 15:21.007
Nice job.

15:22.711 --> 15:24.347
And the rest of you,

15:24.347 --> 15:26.919
your elimination
challenge starts now.

15:30.192 --> 15:33.331
Now, in this
elimination challenge,
you're gonna make

15:33.331 --> 15:36.337
not just
an American classic,

15:36.337 --> 15:38.007
but a Gordon Ramsay classic.

15:40.546 --> 15:43.418
Aarón:
His technique making
this dish is so legendary,

15:43.418 --> 15:47.359
30 million people
have already seen him
do this dish online.

15:47.359 --> 15:48.562
Oh, wow.

15:53.138 --> 15:56.545
Now, I have a lot
of signature dishes.
Beef Wellington, of course,

15:56.545 --> 16:01.053
lobster ravioli, and,
of course, that incredible
sticky toffee pudding.

16:01.053 --> 16:03.826
But the dish that you're
going to be making tonight

16:03.826 --> 16:05.663
was one of the first things
that I mastered.

16:11.340 --> 16:13.946
It is, of course...

16:16.184 --> 16:18.021
( gasps )

16:25.368 --> 16:29.076
The dish that you're
going to be making tonight
is incredible.

16:29.076 --> 16:32.650
It took me months
to perfect.

16:32.650 --> 16:34.453
It is, of course...

16:38.161 --> 16:40.232
‐ Ooh!
‐ scrambled eggs.

16:40.232 --> 16:41.400
But not just
any scrambled egg‐‐

16:41.400 --> 16:43.739
an incredible light,
delicious scrambled egg

16:43.739 --> 16:45.141
served with roasted
vine tomatoes

16:45.141 --> 16:46.410
and grilled mushrooms.

16:46.410 --> 16:49.283
Tonight, we all are
going back to basics.

16:49.283 --> 16:50.953
Yachecia:
<i>Scrambled eggs?</i>

16:50.953 --> 16:53.659
Um, okay.

16:53.659 --> 16:56.698
<i>Lord knows I've made a ton</i>
<i>of scrambled eggs.</i>

16:56.698 --> 16:59.971
However, I know there's
gotta be a catch to this.

16:59.971 --> 17:01.708
Scrambled eggs
may sound simple,

17:01.708 --> 17:06.417
but we are looking for
MasterChef worthy perfection.

17:06.417 --> 17:10.993
My scrambled eggs requires
extreme technical discipline
and precise timing.

17:10.993 --> 17:14.601
Tonight, you'll be making
my scrambled eggs, my way.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.970
Watch and learn.

17:15.970 --> 17:17.941
Eboni:
<i>This may be</i>
<i>a little shocking,</i>

17:17.941 --> 17:20.478
but I have never
scrambled an egg.

17:20.478 --> 17:23.451
<i>In my house, with</i>
<i>my four kids and husband,</i>
<i>we eat fried eggs,</i>

17:23.451 --> 17:26.424
poached eggs, boiled eggs,
not scrambled eggs.

17:26.424 --> 17:29.163
Now, scrambled eggs,
first of all, obviously,

17:29.163 --> 17:31.434
I don't need to show you
how to grill a tomato
and a mushroom.

17:31.434 --> 17:32.670
That's pretty obvious.

17:32.670 --> 17:33.939
But the secret behind
any great scrambled egg

17:33.939 --> 17:36.210
is too make sure you
do not overcook it.

17:36.210 --> 17:39.517
Now, start off
with cold eggs,

17:39.517 --> 17:41.521
straight into the pan.

17:41.521 --> 17:44.527
Take your butter.
Three small knobs of butter.

17:44.527 --> 17:47.366
From there, onto the stove.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.802
Bring the gas up high,

17:48.802 --> 17:51.541
and then start cooking
the eggs very gently.

17:51.541 --> 17:54.480
Every time I stir,
I'm cleaning
the bottom of the pan.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.384
If we were to season
the eggs now,

17:56.384 --> 17:57.486
they would go gray.

17:57.486 --> 18:00.726
So, 30 seconds on.
Back off.

18:00.726 --> 18:02.697
That slows down
the cooking process,

18:02.697 --> 18:04.133
stops the eggs
from overcooking.

18:04.133 --> 18:07.305
So, you need to be
very careful. Back on.

18:07.305 --> 18:11.480
If you've ever cooked it,
you'll see the scrambled eggs
going really watery.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.952
So, it's really important
that you go on and off,
on and off

18:13.952 --> 18:15.890
throughout the whole
three minutes.

18:15.890 --> 18:17.492
They're just starting
to thicken up now.

18:17.492 --> 18:18.996
I'll come back off the heat.

18:18.996 --> 18:20.966
Now, we've cooled it down.

18:20.966 --> 18:23.304
Back on to the heat again.

18:23.304 --> 18:26.678
Now, take your toast,
your tomatoes,

18:26.678 --> 18:29.016
and then your mushrooms.

18:29.016 --> 18:30.318
Back off the heat.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.822
I'm working with it
all the time.

18:31.822 --> 18:33.726
It's now starting
to come together.

18:33.726 --> 18:37.099
You can just see
the texture now.

18:37.099 --> 18:39.671
Goes back on.
Lightly season‐‐

18:39.671 --> 18:41.373
really important,
right at the very end.

18:41.373 --> 18:43.912
That keeps the eggs
nice and fresh,

18:43.912 --> 18:46.885
but here's where it goes to
a completely different level.

18:46.885 --> 18:50.693
Take a teaspoon
of crème fraîche.
That goes in.

18:50.693 --> 18:53.599
That gives a really
nice creamy texture.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.203
More importantly,
it stops them
from overcooking.

18:56.203 --> 19:00.211
Now, come to serve,

19:00.211 --> 19:03.986
I want to see nice, light,
fluffy scrambled eggs.

19:03.986 --> 19:05.556
A little bit creamy.

19:05.556 --> 19:07.994
Scrambled eggs to die for.

19:07.994 --> 19:10.833
And finally, finish
with a little smidgeon

19:10.833 --> 19:14.574
of chopped chives on the top.
Let them sprinkle.

19:14.574 --> 19:18.782
And that's how a MasterChef
perfects scrambled eggs.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.619
‐ Woo!
‐ Beautiful, Chef.

19:20.619 --> 19:22.690
That's awesome.

19:22.690 --> 19:24.259
Gabriel:
<i>It's crazy to me. I've been</i>
<i>watching Gordon Ramsay</i>

19:24.259 --> 19:26.698
since I was 10 years old,
11 years old.

19:26.698 --> 19:28.969
<i>His videos sparked</i>
<i>that interest in me to cook.</i>

19:28.969 --> 19:30.973
Aarón:
All right, guys,
now it's your turn.

19:30.973 --> 19:32.442
Everyone please head
back to your stations.

19:32.442 --> 19:34.948
Gabriel:
<i>Being the main cook</i>
<i>in my family,</i>

19:34.948 --> 19:36.585
<i>I've made these</i>
<i>scrambled eggs before</i>
<i>for breakfast.</i>

19:36.585 --> 19:38.154
<i>If you don't pay attention</i>
<i>to all the details,</i>

19:38.154 --> 19:39.389
it's very easy to mess up.

19:39.389 --> 19:41.995
Each one of you will have
just 15 minutes

19:41.995 --> 19:44.333
to make a perfect plate
of scrambled eggs

19:44.333 --> 19:47.439
with roasted vine tomatoes
and grilled mushrooms,

19:47.439 --> 19:49.577
just like Gordon's.

19:49.577 --> 19:51.815
‐ Is everybody ready?
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

19:51.815 --> 19:54.587
Your 15 minutes...

19:54.587 --> 19:55.823
starts...

19:55.823 --> 19:58.795
now! Let's go.

20:03.839 --> 20:06.377
I make scrambled eggs
with a little milk ordinarily.

20:06.377 --> 20:09.449
Usually, have
a lot of people come over
at my place for brunch,

20:09.449 --> 20:12.155
but I'm challenging myself
by doing it the Ramsay way.

20:12.155 --> 20:14.293
So, I'm feeling really good
about this challenge.

20:14.293 --> 20:15.529
Go, Heather.

20:17.332 --> 20:19.570
I got fresh chickens
back on the ranch.

20:19.570 --> 20:21.373
I have fresh eggs
every day to cook with,

20:21.373 --> 20:23.377
so this is
a little bit different
than we do them at home,

20:23.377 --> 20:24.981
but we're gonna
get it going, though.

20:27.085 --> 20:28.822
I would absolutely
consider myself

20:28.822 --> 20:30.224
the Queen of Breakfast.

20:30.224 --> 20:32.262
I know I wouldn't be able
to perform as a dancer

20:32.262 --> 20:35.435
if I didn't have the energy
that came from a good batch
of scrambled eggs.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.174
There's no way
I'm getting this wrong today.

20:38.174 --> 20:40.345
Christine:
Guys, what I love about
this elimination challenge

20:40.345 --> 20:42.182
is it's the ultimate
leveling field.

20:42.182 --> 20:43.217
Everyone has cooked eggs.

20:43.217 --> 20:44.554
Gordon:
If you're smart tonight,

20:44.554 --> 20:46.290
across those 15 minutes,
get everything organized,

20:46.290 --> 20:47.727
and then with six
or seven minutes to go,

20:47.727 --> 20:50.566
make your scrambled eggs.
It's all in the timing.

20:50.566 --> 20:52.536
They take between four
to five minutes to cook,

20:52.536 --> 20:55.909
so the big question is
who has got the balls

20:55.909 --> 20:57.913
to wait ten minutes
before they start
those eggs?

20:57.913 --> 21:01.153
Whoever does that,
I guarantee you, is gonna be
safe up on the balcony.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.871
I feel pretty good.

21:09.871 --> 21:11.206
I like to make
a soft scrambled egg

21:11.206 --> 21:13.444
similar to the way
that Chef Ramsay gave us.

21:13.444 --> 21:16.684
So, I'm just trying to take
what he heard to perfect

21:16.684 --> 21:18.220
what I think
I all ready know.

21:20.291 --> 21:22.462
Back in Tampa,
we cook eggs all the time.

21:22.462 --> 21:24.366
My fiancée and I,
brunch is everything for us.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.203
I mean, if you can't make
scrambled eggs in the kitchen,

21:26.203 --> 21:28.374
I mean, seriously,
what are you doing here?

21:28.374 --> 21:30.445
Five minutes gone.
10 minutes remaining.

21:30.445 --> 21:32.415
It's all about
the timing tonight.

21:32.415 --> 21:33.718
Last 10 minutes, let's go.

21:33.718 --> 21:35.421
Christine:
We've got that
toasted brioche,

21:35.421 --> 21:37.258
those roasted vine tomatoes,

21:37.258 --> 21:38.595
those beautiful
mushrooms on a plate,

21:38.595 --> 21:41.266
Come on, let's get real.
It's all about the eggs.

21:41.266 --> 21:44.406
Everybody underestimates
the power of techniques

21:44.406 --> 21:46.076
across making
the perfect scrambled egg.

21:46.076 --> 21:47.980
You regulate that
temperature in your pan,

21:47.980 --> 21:49.282
you go up, you go down.

21:49.282 --> 21:51.253
Take it off the heat,
stop them from overcooking.

21:51.253 --> 21:52.756
Go back on the heat.

21:52.756 --> 21:57.265
And seasoning
right at the very end
is paramount.

21:57.265 --> 21:59.670
Fascinating.
Gabriel hasn't even
started the eggs.

21:59.670 --> 22:01.006
It's a good sign for me,

22:01.006 --> 22:02.910
because that's the way
to perfect this challenge.

22:02.910 --> 22:05.448
Eggs go on last.
They wait for nobody.

22:10.158 --> 22:13.497
Just over
five minutes remaining.

22:13.497 --> 22:15.301
Christine:
Remember, this is
an elimination challenge.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.238
Make us a beautiful dish
of scrambled eggs,

22:17.238 --> 22:19.911
you're safe on the balcony.
Let's go.

22:19.911 --> 22:23.852
My fiancée, is actually
pregnant at home with
our son on the way,

22:23.852 --> 22:25.989
so I make eggs for her
as often as I can.

22:25.989 --> 22:30.097
Just gonna take what I saw
from Chef Ramsay there

22:30.097 --> 22:31.433
and execute it.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.970
Daniel's burning the toast.
I mean, come on.

22:32.970 --> 22:34.372
Christine:
What is he doing?

22:34.372 --> 22:36.043
Gordon:
Guys, if you're
burning the toast,

22:36.043 --> 22:37.813
what chance has he got
for the scrambled eggs?

22:40.384 --> 22:42.723
Jeff's starting his eggs.

22:42.723 --> 22:45.027
Gordon:
I don't think he'll be
done in time.

22:45.027 --> 22:47.198
His eggs look really runny.

22:47.198 --> 22:50.806
Just over two minutes
remaining.

22:50.806 --> 22:51.808
Come on, let's go.

22:51.808 --> 22:53.077
Christine:
Come on, now.

22:53.077 --> 22:55.481
Dino looks like he just
has them on high heat.

22:55.481 --> 22:59.155
‐ You've got to work
back and forth, right?
‐ Aarón: Absolutely.

22:59.155 --> 23:01.961
60 seconds remaining.
Come on!

23:01.961 --> 23:03.832
Aarón:
Check that seasoning,
guys, come on.

23:03.832 --> 23:05.602
Gordon:
Taste everything.

23:05.602 --> 23:08.207
It's all about
the precision.

23:08.207 --> 23:11.013
Guys, Heather does not have
any mushrooms on the plate.

23:11.013 --> 23:12.048
Come on, seriously?

23:13.518 --> 23:16.991
It's on fire again?
It's on fire.

23:16.991 --> 23:20.498
‐ 30 seconds remaining.
Come on, Daniel.
‐ Aarón: Let's go, guys.

23:20.498 --> 23:22.335
Check that texture
of those eggs, guys.

23:22.335 --> 23:24.172
Gordon:
It needs to be
on your plate.

23:24.172 --> 23:26.644
If it's in your pan,
you are not safe.

23:27.646 --> 23:30.184
Ten, nine, eight,

23:30.184 --> 23:33.023
seven, six, five,

23:33.023 --> 23:35.696
four, three, two,

23:35.696 --> 23:38.367
one, and stop!
Hands in the air.

23:38.367 --> 23:40.338
Good job, guys.

23:45.849 --> 23:47.519
Aarón:
Check that texture
of those eggs, guys.

23:47.519 --> 23:49.356
Gordon:
It needs to be
on your plate.

23:49.356 --> 23:52.195
If it's in your pan,
you are not safe.

23:52.195 --> 23:54.934
Five, four, three,

23:54.934 --> 23:58.808
two, one, and stop.
Hands in the air.

24:01.146 --> 24:04.386
Gordon:
Wow. Well done,
everybody.

24:04.386 --> 24:06.657
( groans )

24:06.657 --> 24:10.431
It's time to find out
how you all did.

24:14.038 --> 24:15.675
Gabriel:
<i>Being the youngest one here,</i>

24:15.675 --> 24:17.178
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>I have an advantage</i>
<i>in this challenge</i>

24:17.178 --> 24:18.515
<i>because I'm always willing</i>
<i>to try new things.</i>

24:18.515 --> 24:20.351
I'm not too set in my ways.

24:20.351 --> 24:22.355
<i>I'm really hoping</i>
<i>the judges send me up</i>
<i>to the balcony,</i>

24:22.355 --> 24:24.860
<i>because I feel like this</i>
<i>will definitely prove</i>
<i>to my competitors</i>

24:24.860 --> 24:28.033
and to myself that
I know what I'm doing.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.371
Gabriel, have you
seen Chef Gordon make
these eggs before?

24:30.371 --> 24:32.241
Yes, Chef.

24:32.241 --> 24:34.045
What time did
you put those eggs on?

24:34.045 --> 24:36.049
About maybe seven,
six minutes out.

24:42.395 --> 24:43.832
Seven, six minutes, huh?

24:47.739 --> 24:50.110
Well, I'm happy you chose to,
because these are delicious.

24:50.110 --> 24:52.081
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ You are definitely
a good student.

24:52.081 --> 24:54.085
‐ Get up there.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

24:54.085 --> 24:55.421
‐ Good job.
‐ Yeah.

24:55.421 --> 24:57.492
Whew!

24:57.492 --> 25:00.264
Gabriel:
<i>Thank God I watched</i>
<i>that video and I studied</i>

25:00.264 --> 25:01.901
and prepared for what
Chef Ramsay had in store.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.237
‐ Seasoning was very good.
‐ Yep.

25:03.237 --> 25:06.076
I wanna be able to show
that age doesn't matter.

25:06.076 --> 25:07.579
<i>I might be the youngest,</i>
<i>but I've got some aces</i>
<i>up my sleeve.</i>

25:07.579 --> 25:09.048
Take a deep breath.

25:11.086 --> 25:13.625
‐ Welcome.
‐ Jeff, how'd you do?

25:13.625 --> 25:15.896
Not well.

25:15.896 --> 25:17.465
It's a scrambled
( bleep ) on a plate,

25:17.465 --> 25:20.839
and I apologize that
you guys have to eat this.

25:20.839 --> 25:22.008
The proof is in the pudding,

25:22.008 --> 25:23.611
because that's
just what it looks like.

25:23.611 --> 25:25.849
I am not happy
with this one bit.

25:30.457 --> 25:31.661
It's terrible, completely.

25:31.661 --> 25:33.497
‐ Severely under‐seasoned.
‐ Without a doubt.

25:33.497 --> 25:35.835
‐ Severely undercooked.
‐ Without a doubt.

25:35.835 --> 25:38.473
Jeff, you're not safe.
Stay here.

25:38.473 --> 25:41.279
I'm definitely here.
I deserve to be.

25:51.366 --> 25:54.305
‐ Newton, you happy with it?
‐ Yes, sir.

25:54.305 --> 25:56.242
So am I. Delicious.

25:56.242 --> 25:57.345
‐ Head on up.
‐ Thank you.

25:57.345 --> 25:58.815
‐ Incredible.
‐ Yep.

26:04.827 --> 26:06.831
Sam, eggs are
under‐seasoned,

26:06.831 --> 26:09.435
and that crème fraîche
isn't incorporated.

26:09.435 --> 26:11.807
Sorry, you're not safe.
Stay right here.

26:11.807 --> 26:13.945
‐ Hello, Jenny.
‐ Hi, Chef.

26:13.945 --> 26:15.949
How much crème fraîche
did you put in there?

26:15.949 --> 26:18.554
About a teaspoon.

26:18.554 --> 26:19.990
‐ Right at the end?
‐ Right at the end.

26:19.990 --> 26:21.627
I think it's pretty spot on.

26:21.627 --> 26:23.463
‐ Please go up
to the balcony.
‐ Oh, thank you.

26:23.463 --> 26:25.300
‐ Fluffy.
‐ Fluffy, airy.

26:31.346 --> 26:35.555
‐ Brien, that is delicious.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

26:35.555 --> 26:36.757
Head on up to the balcony.

26:36.757 --> 26:38.326
Beautiful, right?
Creamy.

26:43.003 --> 26:44.673
Heather, did you have
some timing issues?

26:44.673 --> 26:47.612
I did.
I wanted to get those
mushrooms on the plate

26:47.612 --> 26:49.783
and I didn't have a chance.

26:59.035 --> 27:01.607
Well, Heather,
it's not seasoned
well enough.

27:01.607 --> 27:05.515
These scrambled eggs,
frankly, are not good enough
and you're not safe.

27:18.173 --> 27:21.614
‐ Not good enough.
You're staying down.
‐ Yes, Chef.

27:27.057 --> 27:29.028
When did you start cooking
your eggs here?

27:29.028 --> 27:30.565
About when it was
seven minutes left.

27:36.109 --> 27:38.548
Whether you put those eggs on
seven minutes to go or not,

27:38.548 --> 27:40.652
they're severely overcooked.

27:40.652 --> 27:43.423
Rubbery, bouncy‐‐
Dino, you're not safe.

27:43.423 --> 27:45.595
‐ Stay right here, please.
‐ Okay, Chef.

27:56.517 --> 27:59.188
Caitlin, the eggs
are under‐seasoned.

27:59.188 --> 28:02.228
It's not a beautiful fluffy
serving of scrambled eggs.

28:02.228 --> 28:03.296
You're not safe.

28:12.949 --> 28:16.422
‐ Necco, did you taste
your scrambled eggs?
‐ Yes, Chef.

28:16.422 --> 28:18.126
I thought they were tasty.

28:20.932 --> 28:22.401
We also thought
they were tasty.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.840
Congratulations.
Delicious. Head on up.

28:24.840 --> 28:26.075
Thank you, Chefs.

28:31.820 --> 28:33.758
Eboni:
<i>My heart is beating</i>
<i>out my chest.</i>

28:33.758 --> 28:36.129
This is my first time
ever making this, legit,

28:36.129 --> 28:37.933
<i>but hopefully</i>
<i>the flavors are there.</i>

28:37.933 --> 28:39.603
<i>I hope they're</i>
<i>creamy and fluffy</i>

28:39.603 --> 28:41.172
<i>like they're supposed to be.</i>

28:41.172 --> 28:42.976
<i>I hope I don't pass out.</i>

28:45.682 --> 28:46.984
I think for someone

28:46.984 --> 28:50.357
who's never made
scrambled eggs before...

28:50.357 --> 28:52.394
‐ I think you nailed it.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

28:52.394 --> 28:54.733
The texture's right.
The seasoning is there.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.002
‐ Great job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

28:56.002 --> 28:57.004
Up to the balcony, please.
You're safe.

28:57.004 --> 28:59.175
‐ Thank you.
‐ Wow, textbook.

28:59.175 --> 29:01.346
‐ Soft, tender, silky.
‐ Delicious.

29:04.485 --> 29:05.989
Hello, Chefs.

29:07.091 --> 29:09.963
Oh, dear. Look at this.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.804
Agreed.

29:16.977 --> 29:18.614
How would you rate
your scrambled egg?

29:18.614 --> 29:20.384
I think they came out nice.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.121
I think I got
that silky texture.

29:22.121 --> 29:24.626
I got the seasoning there.
I think I did a good job.

29:24.626 --> 29:25.962
Let's get one thing right,

29:25.962 --> 29:28.634
you struggled
toasting the brioche.

29:28.634 --> 29:32.374
I did. I was having
a hard time getting an even
toast across the bread.

29:32.374 --> 29:35.681
Well, Daniel...

29:35.681 --> 29:37.351
thank goodness you can
make a scrambled egg.

29:37.351 --> 29:39.689
‐ Delicious. Head on up.
‐ Thank you very much, Chef.

29:39.689 --> 29:40.925
Get yourself a toaster.

29:46.770 --> 29:48.741
All of you up there
on the balcony,

29:48.741 --> 29:50.210
congratulations,
you are all safe.

29:50.210 --> 29:53.684
Those were delicious,
masterful scrambled eggs.

29:56.523 --> 29:58.961
Aarón:
So, now six of you
remain out there.

29:58.961 --> 30:00.464
Please come down here
to the front.

30:02.869 --> 30:05.140
Dino:
<i>I'm not safe right now,</i>
<i>I'm stuck down here.</i>

30:05.140 --> 30:07.211
They weren't
too with my eggs.

30:07.211 --> 30:09.549
<i>I don't know what's</i>
<i>coming up next,</i>

30:09.549 --> 30:11.753
but I'm crapping bricks
at this point.

30:11.753 --> 30:13.891
Now, because
your scrambled eggs
were not cooked

30:13.891 --> 30:15.460
to my standards tonight,

30:15.460 --> 30:19.603
your place
in this competition
is now on the line.

30:19.603 --> 30:22.642
Christina: Now,
in the MasterChef kitchen,

30:22.642 --> 30:23.911
you are all students.

30:23.911 --> 30:25.480
And the best quality
in a student

30:25.480 --> 30:27.819
is their ability
to take criticism

30:27.819 --> 30:30.691
and to learn
from their mistakes.

30:30.691 --> 30:33.163
You six have
one more chance,

30:33.163 --> 30:35.801
and you'll be needing these.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.805
‐ That's right,
‐ Thank you.

30:37.805 --> 30:41.680
you'll be doing this
challenge all over again.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.719
Let's go.
Each of you step up
and grab a box of eggs.

30:44.719 --> 30:46.055
Jeff:
<i>This journey's</i>
<i>not over for me,</i>

30:46.055 --> 30:48.326
<i>and eggs are not going</i>
<i>to hold me back.</i>

30:48.326 --> 30:50.063
If I can focus in
on the clock

30:50.063 --> 30:52.735
and make sure time management
doesn't get the best of me,

30:52.735 --> 30:54.405
<i>I've got a chance</i>
<i>of still surviving.</i>

30:54.405 --> 30:58.747
All six of you need
to do it much, much better
than you just did.

30:58.747 --> 31:01.587
Oh, and there's
an extra bit of pressure.

31:01.587 --> 31:05.026
This time,
you'll have just...

31:05.026 --> 31:06.697
10 minutes.

31:06.697 --> 31:09.101
‐ ( gasps )
‐ Oh, my God.

31:17.852 --> 31:19.856
You six have
one more chance.

31:19.856 --> 31:23.496
That's right,
you'll be doing this
challenge all over again.

31:24.699 --> 31:27.137
And there's
an extra bit of pressure.

31:27.137 --> 31:31.045
This time,
you'll have just
ten minutes.

31:31.045 --> 31:34.686
‐ ( gasps )
‐ Oh, my God.

31:34.686 --> 31:36.690
Aarón: Everyone,
please take your eggs

31:36.690 --> 31:38.827
and head back
to your stations.

31:38.827 --> 31:40.430
Ten minutes?
Aye yai yai.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.000
<i>I'm someone that likes</i>

31:42.000 --> 31:43.504
<i>to take my time</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

31:43.504 --> 31:45.240
This does not play
to my strengths.

31:45.240 --> 31:47.010
Gordon:
Elimination is on the line.

31:47.010 --> 31:51.920
At least one of you
is about to make their
last dish in this kitchen.

31:51.920 --> 31:55.393
Do not go out
on scrambled eggs.

31:55.393 --> 31:57.464
Your ten minutes...

31:57.464 --> 32:00.036
starts...

32:01.973 --> 32:03.811
now.

32:03.811 --> 32:05.548
‐ Come on, guys.
‐ I've got this.

32:05.548 --> 32:08.019
All right, guys.

32:12.729 --> 32:15.266
So, guys, this is
the last chance

32:15.266 --> 32:16.570
for these six
home cooks' redemption.

32:16.570 --> 32:18.072
Aarón:
You guys gotta nail this.

32:18.072 --> 32:21.345
Ten minutes, Jesus.

32:21.345 --> 32:22.915
Gordon:
It's all about the timing.

32:22.915 --> 32:24.385
They have to work quicker now
with ten minutes to go.

32:24.385 --> 32:27.391
Personally,
I'm really surprised
that Jeff is down here,

32:27.391 --> 32:30.698
Dino is down here,
and I'm really surprised
that Yachecia is down here,

32:30.698 --> 32:32.869
because the scrambled eggs
she gave us weeks ago

32:32.869 --> 32:35.039
coming into this competition
were incredible.

32:35.039 --> 32:38.079
Yep.

32:38.079 --> 32:40.785
Gordon:
Three minutes gone.
Seven minutes remaining.

32:40.785 --> 32:44.124
‐ Come on.
‐ Eggs, eggs, eggs.

32:44.124 --> 32:45.126
Get those eggs up.

32:48.065 --> 32:51.907
Oh, my God,
that's so much butter, Sam.

32:51.907 --> 32:53.811
Sam just put two thirds
of a stick of butter in there?

32:53.811 --> 32:56.182
‐ Uh, yeah.
‐ That's like six tablespoons.

32:56.182 --> 32:59.455
Christina:
Do not repeat your mistakes
you made earlier.

32:59.455 --> 33:02.360
Show us you are the student
that deserves to be
in this kitchen.

33:02.360 --> 33:05.400
Get those scrambled eggs
as perfect as possible.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.538
Come on, Sam.

33:07.538 --> 33:09.742
Just over
four minutes remaining.

33:09.742 --> 33:11.212
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

33:12.982 --> 33:14.886
You guys, Heather
is all over the place.

33:14.886 --> 33:17.123
Aarón:
Check that seasoning,
guys, come on.

33:18.159 --> 33:19.161
( Christina gasps )

33:19.161 --> 33:21.265
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ No, Heather!

33:21.265 --> 33:23.637
Look at how much black pepper
just went in Heather's pan?

33:23.637 --> 33:24.906
Oh, my God.

33:24.906 --> 33:27.310
She used almost
a tablespoon of pepper.

33:27.310 --> 33:28.446
I'm really concerned
about that.

33:30.149 --> 33:31.352
Gordon:
Taste everything.

33:31.352 --> 33:33.089
Christine:
Come on, now.

33:33.089 --> 33:34.358
Gordon:
Last minute, guys.
Come on, let's go.

33:34.358 --> 33:35.928
Come on, now.

33:35.928 --> 33:38.432
Gordon:
You want to be plating now.

33:38.432 --> 33:41.372
‐ Jesus...
‐ Please, God, please, God.

33:41.372 --> 33:43.009
Aarón:
Make those final tastes.
Let's go.

33:43.009 --> 33:44.679
Christine:
Come on, guys.

33:44.679 --> 33:46.850
‐ Oh, baby doll.
‐ Look at Dino's.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.789
From here
it looks delicious‐‐
light and fluffy.

33:49.789 --> 33:51.325
30 seconds remaining.

33:51.325 --> 33:53.530
Come on, Jeff.
You got to get it
on that plate.

33:53.530 --> 33:56.035
Taste, Sam. Come on, Sam.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.638
Oh, my God,
his eggs are watery.

33:57.638 --> 34:00.310
His eggs are watery.
Crank the heat up.

34:00.310 --> 34:01.680
15 seconds to go.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.149
Christine:
Come on, guys.

34:03.149 --> 34:04.752
Make it pretty.
Make it pretty.

34:04.752 --> 34:06.923
Ten, nine, eight,

34:06.923 --> 34:09.963
‐ seven, six, five,
‐ Heather, get it
on the plate.

34:09.963 --> 34:12.802
four, three, two,

34:12.802 --> 34:16.141
‐ one, and stop.
‐ Hands are in the air.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.279
‐ Good job, guys.
‐ Good job, guys.

34:23.222 --> 34:26.529
Adam:
Sam's are not cooked.
Look at that.

34:26.529 --> 34:30.336
All right, home cooks,
bring those scrambled egg
dishes to the front.

34:39.922 --> 34:44.732
So, visually, it's a nice
shiny, silky texture.

34:44.732 --> 34:46.001
Thank you.

34:51.211 --> 34:54.686
Wow, it's rich. It's creamy.
Seasoned beautifully.

34:54.686 --> 34:56.188
‐ You've nailed it.
‐ Thank you.

35:03.135 --> 35:04.572
‐ Miss Yachecia.
‐ Yes, Chef?

35:04.572 --> 35:07.243
I have to say
right off the bat,
I love the color.

35:07.243 --> 35:08.680
It's even, it's uniform.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.318
It has that beautiful gloss
and sheen to the outside.

35:11.318 --> 35:13.757
Thank you, Chef.

35:13.757 --> 35:15.828
It's well seasoned.
It's fluffy, it's airy.

35:15.828 --> 35:17.197
It has the right
amount of fat

35:17.197 --> 35:19.569
by way of
the crème fraîche
and the butter.

35:19.569 --> 35:21.706
‐ Excellent job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

35:25.848 --> 35:27.450
All right, Miss Caitlin,

35:27.450 --> 35:30.924
visually an improvement
from a volume standpoint.

35:30.924 --> 35:33.530
Let's see how it tastes.

35:33.530 --> 35:36.034
Nice cook there.
I can still see
the moisture in the center.

35:36.034 --> 35:37.370
Thank you.

35:41.546 --> 35:45.821
I think you definitely
remedied the seasoning.
I like the richness.

35:45.821 --> 35:47.792
Definitely an improvement

35:47.792 --> 35:49.896
‐ from your last
scrambled eggs dish.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

35:52.768 --> 35:55.006
‐ Sam.
‐ Yes, Chef?

35:55.006 --> 35:59.281
Okay, visually,
just look left
and look right

35:59.281 --> 36:03.790
‐ and then come back to
your liquid scrambled egg.
‐ Yes.

36:03.790 --> 36:06.295
It looks like
a grilled cheese from here.

36:06.295 --> 36:08.700
What do I need?
A ( bleep ) straw?

36:10.537 --> 36:12.307
What is it with you
and the timing?

36:12.307 --> 36:15.446
I have a hard time focusing
and the time is hard for me.

36:15.446 --> 36:17.283
We're talking about
scrambled eggs.

36:17.283 --> 36:18.385
I'm aware.

36:28.005 --> 36:31.980
Sam, what would you give
yourself in class?
Out of ten?

36:31.980 --> 36:33.249
I don't know.
About a five.

36:33.249 --> 36:34.451
A five?

36:35.988 --> 36:37.290
Generous.

36:44.304 --> 36:48.012
So, Dino, looking at it,
it has that beautiful golden
sheen on the outside.

36:48.012 --> 36:49.682
It almost looks like the sun.

36:49.682 --> 36:52.020
It doesn't have tons
of specks of black pepper,

36:52.020 --> 36:53.523
which is a good thing.

36:53.523 --> 36:55.994
A lot of people underestimate
how powerful black pepper is.

36:55.994 --> 36:58.533
It can really kill a dish.

36:58.533 --> 37:01.338
‐ I love the way
it's proportionate.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

37:07.283 --> 37:09.588
It's creamy,
it's well seasoned.

37:09.588 --> 37:12.528
It's consistent
in flavor and consistent
in the way it's cooked.

37:12.528 --> 37:15.266
‐ Excellent.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

37:17.972 --> 37:19.474
All right, Miss Heather,

37:19.474 --> 37:21.879
first round
of scrambled eggs
didn't go so well.

37:21.879 --> 37:24.719
‐ Not so well.
‐ What did you learn
from that first cook?

37:24.719 --> 37:27.891
My eggs were overcooked.
I also was under‐seasoned.

37:27.891 --> 37:29.895
So, I added salt
and I also put some pepper

37:29.895 --> 37:31.498
in there as well
to get a little kick.

37:35.974 --> 37:37.578
That's a lot of pepper.

37:37.578 --> 37:39.815
I was a little heavy‐handed
with the pepper, probably.

37:39.815 --> 37:41.385
( coughs )

37:56.682 --> 37:58.686
What did you learn
from that first cook?

37:58.686 --> 38:01.692
My eggs were overcooked.
I also was under‐seasoned.

38:01.692 --> 38:03.897
So, I added salt and
some pepper in there as well

38:03.897 --> 38:04.999
to get a little kick.

38:04.999 --> 38:07.136
That's a lot of pepper.

38:07.136 --> 38:09.642
I was a little heavy‐handed
with the pepper, probably.

38:09.642 --> 38:11.679
( coughs )

38:12.881 --> 38:15.319
( coughing )

38:15.319 --> 38:17.825
Let's just a look
at this color‐wise.

38:17.825 --> 38:19.829
Wow. The color
is dark and gray.

38:19.829 --> 38:21.732
I may have put
a little too much pepper

38:21.732 --> 38:23.235
to make it that brown color.

38:23.235 --> 38:26.341
And they're almost gray
from black pepper, Heather.

38:28.613 --> 38:30.349
Okay.

38:33.890 --> 38:36.094
All right, home cooks,
please come around
to the front.

38:38.265 --> 38:40.302
Gordon:
So, some made some
vast improvements.

38:40.302 --> 38:41.806
Heather's‐‐ ( coughs )

38:41.806 --> 38:43.408
Aarón:
You can't get past
one bite of that egg.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.045
Too much black pepper.

38:45.045 --> 38:47.551
Sam's?
Severely undercooked.

38:47.551 --> 38:49.053
Has he shown he's
good enough of a student?

38:49.053 --> 38:53.495
‐ Are we straight? Okay.
‐ I think so.

38:53.495 --> 38:55.634
Aarón:
All six of you
found yourselves here

38:55.634 --> 38:57.170
cooking for a second time.

38:57.170 --> 38:59.675
And this was all
about who could adapt,
who could learn,

38:59.675 --> 39:01.679
and some of you did better
than others tonight.

39:03.917 --> 39:07.390
There were two home cooks
that went from zero to hero.

39:09.762 --> 39:11.097
Please step forward,
Yachecia.

39:12.099 --> 39:14.204
And, Dino, step forward.

39:14.204 --> 39:17.644
‐ Dino, baby.
‐ Nice job, you two.

39:19.882 --> 39:24.057
Both of you displayed grit,
you took direction well,

39:24.057 --> 39:26.629
and that is what makes
a great MasterChef.

39:26.629 --> 39:30.570
‐ Go upstairs, please.
‐ Thank you, Chef.
Thank you, Chef.

39:30.570 --> 39:32.273
Good job, you guys.

39:36.481 --> 39:38.753
So, then there were four.

39:38.753 --> 39:41.091
Will the following
two home cooks

39:41.091 --> 39:42.928
please step forward?

39:42.928 --> 39:46.201
Caitlin...

39:46.201 --> 39:50.109
and Jeff...

39:50.109 --> 39:51.946
‐ go head on up.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

39:58.526 --> 40:01.632
Sam, Heather, this has been
a very tough decision.

40:01.632 --> 40:03.836
Unfortunately,
we have to say good‐bye

40:03.836 --> 40:07.143
to at least one
of you this evening.

40:07.143 --> 40:08.646
Sam, you had
all the makings

40:08.646 --> 40:10.482
of a great scrambled egg,
but unfinished.

40:10.482 --> 40:14.390
Heather, your eggs
are way to peppery.

40:14.390 --> 40:17.330
I'm surprised,
because you're both
smart individuals.

40:17.330 --> 40:19.100
I didn't expect it
to come down to this.

40:22.373 --> 40:26.181
Sam, please step forward...

40:29.521 --> 40:32.026
and say good night...

40:34.898 --> 40:36.034
to Heather...

40:37.403 --> 40:39.608
and make your way
up those stairs.

40:41.645 --> 40:43.048
Whoa.

40:47.591 --> 40:50.897
Heather, this challenge
was about technique,

40:50.897 --> 40:52.500
about being
a great student,

40:52.500 --> 40:54.638
and though you didn't
make the same mistakes

40:54.638 --> 40:57.476
that you made the first time,
you made different mistakes.

40:57.476 --> 40:59.247
You've got a lot of gusto.

40:59.247 --> 41:01.351
I think you've
got a lot of drive.

41:01.351 --> 41:04.023
‐ Tonight just
wasn't your night.
‐ Yeah.

41:04.023 --> 41:05.927
Please leave your apron
on your station.

41:05.927 --> 41:08.098
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

41:08.098 --> 41:10.035
‐ Love you, Heather!
‐ Heather, we love you.

41:10.035 --> 41:11.639
Bye, Heather.

41:11.639 --> 41:13.709
Heather: <i>Leaving</i>
<i>the MasterChef kitchen,</i>

41:13.709 --> 41:15.112
I'm proud of myself.

41:15.112 --> 41:17.249
<i>Getting to the Top 18</i>
<i>is not easy,</i>

41:17.249 --> 41:19.387
<i>so this is definitely</i>
<i>a step forward.</i>

41:19.387 --> 41:20.890
<i>Being a nurse,</i>
<i>it's really important for me</i>

41:20.890 --> 41:22.794
to show people
that I care for them,

41:22.794 --> 41:25.667
<i>and I was able to do that</i>
<i>with my cooking.</i>

41:25.667 --> 41:27.971
<i>And I've learned a lot more</i>
<i>skill from being here</i>

41:27.971 --> 41:29.741
to be able to do
that even more.

41:29.741 --> 41:30.910
Bye, Heather.

<i>Next week...</i>

41:35.954 --> 41:37.991
Gordon:
On the menu tonight, lamb.

41:37.991 --> 41:40.362
<i>the Top 17 have</i>
<i>front row seats</i>

41:40.362 --> 41:43.168
<i>to a Gordon Ramsay</i>
<i>master class.</i>

41:43.168 --> 41:45.138
Jason:
<i>Chef Ramsay looks</i>
<i>so precision‐like.</i>

41:45.138 --> 41:47.443
Can we do this today?
This is crazy.

41:47.443 --> 41:49.046
Gordon:
You've got to speed up.

41:49.046 --> 41:51.217
Announcer: <i>And when</i>
<i>the competition heats up,</i>

41:51.217 --> 41:53.221
<i>who has the chops...</i>

41:53.221 --> 41:55.192
It's beautifully done.
You just cooked like
a chef's dream.

41:55.192 --> 41:56.461
<i>to make the cut?</i>

41:56.461 --> 41:57.697
Ugh.

41:57.697 --> 41:58.733
I wouldn't even
( bleep ) swallow that.

41:58.733 --> 42:00.135
I can't do that
to my palate.

42:00.135 --> 42:01.972
Eboni:
<i>I cannot believe</i>
<i>my eyes right now.</i>

42:01.972 --> 42:03.141
This sucks.

42:03.141 --> 42:05.312
What in the ( bleep )
