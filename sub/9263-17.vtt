WEBVTT

00:01.101 --> 00:02.932
She's on the phone right
now with Matt Saracen.

00:03.003 --> 00:06.564
It's becoming that thing that we always
knew was gonna happen with our little girl.

00:06.673 --> 00:10.302
We've kinda been going out, but
we never really made it official.

00:10.377 --> 00:11.810
Will you be my girlfriend?

00:11.978 --> 00:14.845
I'm here to inform you
that you have been invited

00:14.948 --> 00:16.677
to training
camp in Austin.

00:16.816 --> 00:19.512
Quad rugby national team
is having tryouts in Austin.

00:19.586 --> 00:22.680
And if I go and I make the team, possibly
be going to Beijing later this year.

00:22.756 --> 00:23.780
Hey, Tyra.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.119
Your mom
is the greatest.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.250
She volunteered to help me
finish out tonight.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.658
What is your problem?
Your dad. Buddy Garrity.

00:29.729 --> 00:31.924
His dirty hands all over my
mom, his employee.

00:31.998 --> 00:34.558
Dad is down in Corpus Christi.
He's working on a driving range.

00:34.634 --> 00:37.330
Do not believe a word that that man
says. And do not get drunk with him.

00:37.404 --> 00:39.395
I'm on the wagon now.
Sober, uh...

00:39.472 --> 00:40.734
Six weeks next Tuesday.

00:40.807 --> 00:43.071
Tim! What are you doing?
Dad's here.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.516
How about another round,
sweetheart? Let's go, uh...

00:51.684 --> 00:55.085
Three. Corner.
Buck, you is on fire!

00:56.022 --> 00:58.217
Ooh.
Nice shot.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.986
Oh, Lord. That was nice.

01:01.528 --> 01:04.224
Yes! Nice shot I don't
know what's gotten into him.

01:04.297 --> 01:05.286
I really don't.

01:05.364 --> 01:08.732
I'd say his game's improved quite a
bit in the last half hour, wouldn't you?

01:08.802 --> 01:10.827
It's weird, huh?
Yeah, I'll say.

01:11.971 --> 01:13.370
Thank you, darling.

01:15.108 --> 01:17.372
Watch your back, sir.
Don't want to hit you.

01:17.644 --> 01:20.943
This is for all the money.
Oh, baby!

01:21.014 --> 01:23.505
The winners? Who's the
winners? All the way home!

01:23.583 --> 01:25.050
Oh, now you're up
against it.

01:25.118 --> 01:27.518
Hey, you wouldn't be hustling
us here now would you?

01:27.587 --> 01:29.418
Hustling you?
Yeah.

01:29.489 --> 01:32.049
Hustling you, beating you with
one hand tied behind my back

01:32.125 --> 01:34.389
either way you still owe
me a hundred bucks.

01:34.627 --> 01:37.061
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

01:37.797 --> 01:39.765
Huh? I'm talking to the guy
who owes me a hundred bucks.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.993
The loser who owes me
a hundred bucks.

01:42.068 --> 01:43.228
Oh, really?
Uh-huh.

01:43.303 --> 01:46.272
And how is it you come in this
place and that boy can't hit a shot?

01:46.339 --> 01:48.239
Boy, you play just like a... Ow!

01:51.010 --> 01:52.170
Who the hell threw that?

01:52.245 --> 01:53.234
No idea.

01:53.313 --> 01:54.712
Did you throw that?

01:54.781 --> 01:56.043
Me? No.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.016
Hey...
Punk! You wanna fight with me?

01:58.084 --> 02:00.245
Huh? You wanna fight me? Take me down?

02:00.320 --> 02:02.754
Aren't you gonna do anything about
this? My boy can handle himself.

02:02.822 --> 02:04.050
I'll take you outside.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.352
There's to be no fighting
in here, Buck!

02:05.425 --> 02:07.359
You lost.
Now pay up and leave.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.722
Hundred bucks.

02:09.729 --> 02:10.957
There's your money.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.358
You wanna take me on,
you come back and find me.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.457
Get out!

02:18.938 --> 02:20.030
Hablar.

02:20.673 --> 02:21.935
Hablar.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.435
Hablo, hablas, habla,
hablamos, hablan. That works.

02:24.511 --> 02:25.500
Hmm?

02:28.047 --> 02:29.514
Matt? Matt?

02:29.582 --> 02:31.174
Yeah?

02:32.218 --> 02:34.186
Did you eat the last of
that pudding?

02:34.921 --> 02:35.910
What?

02:35.989 --> 02:39.755
Now you know I like a little pudding at the
end of the day just to settle my stomach.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.293
Hi, Julie.
Hey.

02:41.794 --> 02:45.093
Now hands off my tapioca,
Matthew.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.359
Yes, ma'am.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.208 --> 02:57.005
So you wanna maybe try and
study again in the...

02:57.076 --> 02:58.566
I think we should have sex.

02:59.412 --> 03:00.743
...morning?

03:01.814 --> 03:03.679
Well, I think it's time.
Don't you think?

03:05.852 --> 03:07.911
Yeah. Me, too.
So, um...

03:08.021 --> 03:09.511
Let's get on that.

03:09.889 --> 03:10.913
Goodnight.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.121
Hi, Matt.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.558
Hi, Miss...

03:18.831 --> 03:20.594
Miss Coach.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.478
No. I'm telling you, Matt. This
is the watershed moment. Here.

04:10.550 --> 04:13.485
I mean you're going into
an entirely new realm.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.952
I got a, um... Look, I've got
just a little gift for you.

04:17.055 --> 04:18.421
I found this in my dad's glove
compartment.

04:18.491 --> 04:19.480
No. No! Landry.

04:19.559 --> 04:20.958
I found it
and I was just thinking.

04:21.027 --> 04:23.461
Get that nasty, raggedy-assed
thing out of here.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.998
Look. Come on. Come on.
Excuse me. One second.

04:26.199 --> 04:29.396
Now look. You got her
at first and inches

04:29.736 --> 04:32.330
but you still gotta read
the coverage. Okay?

04:32.472 --> 04:34.667
Now I ain't trying to
encourage sex out of wedlock.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.308
Don't put it on old Smash.
Okay.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.174
But if you're gonna do it,

04:39.245 --> 04:41.338
you're gonna need to think
about logistics.

04:41.414 --> 04:44.577
You're gonna need a time.
You're gonna need a place.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.384
And you're gonna need
some fresh protection.

04:48.521 --> 04:51.251
Yeah, he is right.
You got some work to do, son.

04:52.692 --> 04:56.492
All right. This is Sixth
Street, Austin. Party central.

04:56.562 --> 04:58.962
Eyeballs deep in beautiful
women, man.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.966
I don't care about...
Austin women!

05:01.034 --> 05:03.969
Being up to your eyeballs in women.
I care about getting to practice.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.265
It's a big deal.

05:05.338 --> 05:06.362
Hey!

05:06.439 --> 05:08.168
How you doing, baby?
Woo!

05:09.375 --> 05:11.741
Hey, darling!
Oh, my lord.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.711
We're gonna hit that later.
We're gonna be late, Herc.

05:13.780 --> 05:14.804
We're gonna be late!
Will you relax!

05:14.881 --> 05:16.143
I told you we were gonna
be late. I told you!

05:16.215 --> 05:17.204
Mad at you?

05:17.283 --> 05:18.545
I am mad at you.
You crying?

05:18.618 --> 05:19.642
I am very mad at you.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.949
And you wanna know why? 'Cause
this is a big deal to me.

05:22.021 --> 05:23.750
And to you, it seems like you
don't wanna...

05:23.823 --> 05:24.847
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Shut up.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.016
Shut up. Shut up.
You don't wanna...

05:26.092 --> 05:27.252
I thought we were done.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.455
Look. How are you doing? I need to
know everything about you right now.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.930
Your full name. What's your
favorite color? And what you drink?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.830
Uh... hi.
Jason Street.

05:34.901 --> 05:35.993
Nice job! Let's go!

05:36.069 --> 05:37.263
Is this your first time here?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.237
Actually, I don't really have
time for a conversation.

05:39.305 --> 05:41.239
So if you could just sign
me in that'd be great.

05:41.307 --> 05:42.706
It's not me asking.

05:42.775 --> 05:45.107
It's a question on the form.

05:46.412 --> 05:49.677
Jason Street. There's your
welcome packet and your room key.

05:49.749 --> 05:52.217
There is your jersey.

05:53.419 --> 05:55.148
Have fun.
Hey.

05:55.288 --> 05:58.655
I'm already having fun, Mo. I'm
gonna get me some "Mo" later,

05:58.725 --> 06:00.989
I'll be ready for some "Mo. " All right.

06:02.729 --> 06:04.094
Did you really fall for that?

06:04.163 --> 06:05.152
Kind of.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.861
Where the hell have you
guys been?

06:09.936 --> 06:11.836
I don't wanna hear any
excuses.

06:12.505 --> 06:14.530
What are you looking at?
Uh... Nothing, sir.

06:14.607 --> 06:16.632
Get around! Get in the chair!
Yes, sir.

06:17.110 --> 06:20.705
What are you guys looking at? Let's
go! Let's play some rugby! Let's go!

06:28.554 --> 06:31.114
Yeah?
Hi. Is Billy in?

06:31.190 --> 06:33.420
Billy, some chick's here
to see you.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.154
Sweetheart. I'll be a second.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.390
All right.

06:38.931 --> 06:39.955
What's up?

06:40.032 --> 06:42.091
I'm actually, uh,
here about Tim.

06:43.002 --> 06:45.903
Oh... Walt... He's,
uh... He's drinking again.

06:45.972 --> 06:46.996
Well, that's...

06:47.073 --> 06:48.233
Deal or No Deal's on,
Billy.

06:48.307 --> 06:50.741
Yeah. Uh... That's right
on schedule, so...

06:50.810 --> 06:52.903
Yeah. Well, Tim doesn't seem
to see anything wrong with it.

06:52.979 --> 06:54.708
And it just seemed like he was
doing so much better.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.375
So I just thought that maybe
you would, you know... You, uh...

06:57.450 --> 06:59.111
Talk to him.
You can't help him.

06:59.685 --> 07:00.674
Okay?

07:01.821 --> 07:03.220
I've done everything I could
for him.

07:03.289 --> 07:06.850
He chose Walt in this situation. He's
made his bed and now he's gotta lie in it.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.292
He's just gonna have to live
with the decision. All right?

07:09.362 --> 07:10.454
All right.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.333
Eric, you're my friend, right? I can
talk to you about anything, right?

07:19.639 --> 07:22.904
Yeah. Well, I'll just put it
point blank.

07:24.477 --> 07:27.969
I strayed outside my marriage.
I mean...

07:29.315 --> 07:32.182
And the problem is now she
thinks it's more than it is.

07:32.318 --> 07:34.081
Uh-uh. No. No.
Yep.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.643
I'm saying uh-uh. I don't
want to know who it is

07:35.721 --> 07:36.949
and I don't want to know
anything about it.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.957
Yeah, I mean we had
a wonderful time.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.049
Don't... don't...

07:40.126 --> 07:42.993
She's a wildcat. You know
what I mean? But it's just...

07:43.830 --> 07:44.956
I can't... I mean she...

07:45.031 --> 07:46.055
Keep your voice down.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.760
I may have said some
things in the heat of passion.

07:48.835 --> 07:52.464
You know? I may have said I was
unhappy in my marriage in some ways

07:52.538 --> 07:53.937
but you know how it is.

07:54.006 --> 07:55.769
No, Buddy.
I don't know how it is.

07:58.377 --> 08:01.744
Well, that's not the only
problem. She also...

08:02.448 --> 08:04.382
She works for me.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.351
I know. I know.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.682
Hey, Eric.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.122
Hey, I'm a weak man.

08:13.192 --> 08:15.183
You're a stupid man.
No, I'm a sinner.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.821
You know? I'm just looking for a
little guidance here. Just a little...

08:17.897 --> 08:19.125
Just a little advice is all
I'm asking for.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.222
You want some advice?

08:20.299 --> 08:21.926
Yeah, I do.
Number one,

08:23.636 --> 08:27.072
you should tell this woman, whoever
the hell it is and I don't want to know,

08:27.139 --> 08:29.664
that under no uncertain terms
that it's over.

08:29.742 --> 08:30.731
Number two,

08:31.244 --> 08:35.340
you need to go home and take care of your
wife and think about those kids of yours.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.446
That's all I got to say.

08:39.284 --> 08:40.342
I'II let you cover the bill.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.216
Oh, I got it. I got it.
Thanks.

08:49.061 --> 08:51.154
Okay, let's see what we
got here. We got, um...

08:51.664 --> 08:53.859
Got Endure, Elasticon.

08:53.933 --> 08:58.267
We got, uh, True Fit. We... We
can cancel out Mega I believe.

08:58.337 --> 08:59.770
I think you should think about
Elasticon, so...

08:59.839 --> 09:00.863
Let's do this. Let's...

09:00.940 --> 09:02.202
Let's just get this.
Now hold on. Wait.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.607
God, I mean this is an
important decision here,

09:04.744 --> 09:07.338
Matt. You gotta look at everything.
Didn't you hear what Smash said?

09:07.413 --> 09:08.402
"It's all in the details. "

09:08.481 --> 09:10.039
None of this is gonna matter
if I die

09:10.116 --> 09:11.845
of embarrassment first, so
let's just get it and go.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.351
You are not.
You're being a baby.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.751
Okay. Something that protects
everyone from everything.

09:15.821 --> 09:16.810
All right.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.790
Yes, those. Let's get those.
Let's get those. Okay. Fine.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.189
We'll do it.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.294
You sure you don't need like
a backup or something? Backup?

09:24.363 --> 09:25.489
Just in case those don't...

09:25.565 --> 09:26.827
There's like 12 of them
in here.

09:26.899 --> 09:27.888
I know but...

09:43.549 --> 09:44.880
Hi.
Hey.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.418
I saw Matt Saracen buying
condoms today.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.250
Oh.

09:56.028 --> 09:58.223
You know anything about that?

09:59.832 --> 10:00.992
No.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.398
Really nothing?

10:03.336 --> 10:04.462
Uh-uh.

10:05.237 --> 10:08.764
Well, he was either buying them for you
or he was buying them for somebody else.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.974
I think you better come
talk to me.

10:28.327 --> 10:29.316
Okay.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.191
Are you and Matt Saracen
having sex?

10:37.703 --> 10:38.692
No.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.102
We're thinking about it.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.814
You're thinking about it.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.714
Are you thinking about
pregnancy?

10:56.789 --> 10:59.724
Are you thinking about
sexually transmitted diseases?

10:59.792 --> 11:02.818
Well... I mean, obviously.
That's why he's buying condoms.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.260
Oh, I see.
So you're just

11:04.330 --> 11:07.822
buying condoms and then when you buy condoms
that just makes you ready to make love

11:07.900 --> 11:09.162
to somebody.
Anybody.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.259
"Making love. "

11:10.336 --> 11:12.167
Don't do that. Don't you
smirk at me right now.

11:12.238 --> 11:14.206
I am very upset!

11:15.107 --> 11:18.099
You are not allowed
to have sex!

11:18.244 --> 11:20.439
You're 15 years old!

11:23.482 --> 11:26.645
I just... I don't see what's the big deal.
It's just one body part going into another.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.277
No, it's not. No, it's not.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.822
It's not just one body part
going into another body part.

11:30.890 --> 11:34.382
And the fact that you think it's not just
one body part going into another body part

11:34.460 --> 11:36.428
makes me real clear

11:36.495 --> 11:39.464
on the fact that you
really are not ready for this.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.857
And I need you to be able
to hear that.

11:42.268 --> 11:44.566
I need you to be able to
hear me say that to you.

11:46.572 --> 11:48.199
I'm listening to you.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.967
Let me tell you what
the big deal is.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.067
Let me tell you
what can happen.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.476
What can happen is that
you can be hurt.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.680
And you can be
degraded.

11:59.151 --> 12:01.915
And you can become hard
and you can become cynical.

12:01.987 --> 12:04.080
And I don't want that
to happen to you.

12:07.026 --> 12:09.324
This is something
that's special.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.920
It's something that's meant
from people who are in love.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.164
Okay. I...
I understand.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.060
And you can wait.

12:26.812 --> 12:29.178
I want you to be able
to talk to me about it.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.273
Okay. I mean,
we're talking, right?

13:06.986 --> 13:07.975
Matt.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.652
Hey. What's up? What's going on? Hey.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.255
So my mom saw you buying
condoms last night.

13:15.628 --> 13:19.029
Did she... Is she...
Is she gonna tell your dad?

13:19.098 --> 13:20.963
No. She said
she wasn't going to.

13:21.033 --> 13:23.024
So then we're not gonna do
this. We're not gonna have sex.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.535
No. We are gonna do this.

13:24.603 --> 13:28.505
And I just don't understand what the whole
hysteria is over losing your virginity.

13:29.408 --> 13:32.104
Um... well, I got us
Bradley's lake house.

13:32.611 --> 13:34.203
You told Bradley?

13:34.313 --> 13:36.577
So Bradley...
Does the entire team know now?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.708
Well, just Bradley.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.878
And Bradley's Bradley, so Bradley
won't say... Bradley's good.

13:41.954 --> 13:44.514
You don't need... You don't need
to worry. He won't say anything.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.924
Okay.
Okay.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.721
All right. So here's
the thing, Matty Boy.

13:48.794 --> 13:51.592
Hundred and eighty seconds.
Anything else is failure.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.633
Hundred and eighty.
I can do 180.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.327
I can do that.
Hey, look.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.733
You gotta use
your camera phone.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.202
I don't even have a phone.

13:59.271 --> 14:00.738
You don't have a...
I'II let you use mine.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.797
But you gotta have something
to remember. All right, seven.

14:02.875 --> 14:04.775
Don't let these rookies
tell you what's going on.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.812
Remember the first time you
drove a car?

14:06.912 --> 14:10.439
Yeah, I crashed my grandma's car
and now Landry drives me around.

14:11.884 --> 14:13.784
Good luck to you, seven.

14:13.886 --> 14:15.217
Stand on your own time.
Let's go!

14:15.287 --> 14:18.051
Yeah, baby! Dig! Dig!
That's my boy!

14:21.360 --> 14:23.851
Hey, Riggs, that's real cute.
You got your pop cheering you on.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.191
Mr. Riggins,
can I help you?

14:25.264 --> 14:27.232
Hey, Coach.
First team over the ball!

14:27.299 --> 14:30.063
Why don't you give him more carries?
He's as good as that Smash kid.

14:31.103 --> 14:33.537
Tell you what. We're right in
the middle of practice right now.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.540
If you like, you can stand
over there on the sidelines...

14:35.608 --> 14:36.632
No, I'm serious.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.142
Why don't you give him
more carries? That's all.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.474
I think maybe we can talk about
this at a more appropriate time.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.672
I'm in the middle of practice
right now.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.372
You're more than welcome
to stay on the sidelines.

14:43.449 --> 14:44.438
Hey, Coach. Coach.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.507
Blue! Eighty!
Blue! Eighty!

14:46.585 --> 14:47.574
Hut!

14:48.988 --> 14:51.422
You're really king of this
castle, aren't you? Huh?

14:53.692 --> 14:55.250
You think you're better than
me? Is that it?

14:55.327 --> 14:57.557
Okay. Let's run it again. Set!

14:57.630 --> 14:59.461
Over on the sidelines
will be fine.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.728
All right! Let's go!

15:03.435 --> 15:04.902
Run it back down!

15:05.704 --> 15:08.036
Get 'em, son!

15:13.879 --> 15:15.642
Coach?
Yeah.

15:15.714 --> 15:19.775
Uh, remember that, uh, camera
that we got from Boosters?

15:19.852 --> 15:21.843
Yeah.
It's missing.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.517
What do you mean,
"It's missing"?

15:24.590 --> 15:25.579
Can't find it.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.557
It's a $3000 camera.
You better find it.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.656
Yeah?
It's just, uh...

15:31.730 --> 15:34.460
It's great to feel like part
of a team again, you know?

15:34.533 --> 15:37.366
I've got the least experience but
I'm pretty sure I'm a better athlete

15:37.436 --> 15:38.903
than two of them.
And, uh...

15:39.004 --> 15:40.096
So that just leaves
this other guy.

15:40.172 --> 15:41.901
Hi, honey.
Hello.

15:41.974 --> 15:43.202
What?

15:44.043 --> 15:45.943
You know? I think I
could take him. You know?

15:47.846 --> 15:48.870
Babe?

15:48.948 --> 15:51.143
Love you, too.
Lyla? Am I boring you?

15:51.216 --> 15:52.274
Are you with me.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.579
No, it's just...

15:53.819 --> 15:56.754
My dad just walked in and
started making out with my mom.

15:57.723 --> 15:59.850
What are you doing? She's
gonna know you're at a party!

15:59.925 --> 16:01.119
Are you at a party?

16:01.193 --> 16:02.217
No. No party.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.489
No... It's a "partay. " It's
not a party. It's not a party.

16:04.563 --> 16:05.928
It's just, uh...

16:06.432 --> 16:08.423
I thought it was gonna be
all work stuff.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.628
Well, it is. It's just
a couple of the boys, babe.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.365
It's no big deal. Okay?

16:13.639 --> 16:16.301
Oh, yeah. Buddy! Aw...

16:22.982 --> 16:25.212
Would you, uh... I spilled a little.
Would you get me a paper towel

16:25.284 --> 16:27.309
out from underneath that
sink? Just right over there.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.233
What are you doing?

16:48.640 --> 16:51.268
Oh! I, uh... Hey.
I'm, uh...

16:52.044 --> 16:53.375
Just...

16:53.879 --> 16:56.848
I was designated to pick
the next CD

16:56.915 --> 16:58.746
and we're kind of out
of options.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.810
Well, what do you got? God... you know
I don't even recognize half of these.

17:02.888 --> 17:04.480
What was right there?
That one you just touched?

17:04.556 --> 17:06.421
I don't know.

17:06.492 --> 17:07.959
That's a classic.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.460
Gotta go with that.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.497
Loretta Lynn. Nice.

17:14.299 --> 17:15.664
So, uh...

17:15.733 --> 17:18.794
Look, I just want to say I'm sorry about
yesterday. I didn't mean to come off...

17:18.871 --> 17:21.203
Oh, no.
No. Me, I...

17:22.540 --> 17:25.066
I'm sorry I was such a bitch.
It was...

17:25.611 --> 17:27.511
A long day.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.046
I'm sure it was.

17:30.282 --> 17:31.943
I'm Jason Street.

17:32.618 --> 17:35.348
Uh... Suzy Quinlan.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.856
Nice to meet you.

17:38.457 --> 17:41.187
So, uh...
So do you work for the team?

17:41.260 --> 17:43.922
Oh, no. That was, uh...
That was just a day job.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.487
I'm trying to get my business
off the ground and...

17:46.565 --> 17:48.430
What's your... What's your...
Every little bit helps.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.660
What's your business?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.862
Ink.
I'm a tattoo artist.

17:51.937 --> 17:53.165
Seriously?

17:53.572 --> 17:55.005
Seriously.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.837
That's awesome.
Are these yours?

17:59.344 --> 18:01.141
All right. There's four
of them. Thanks, man.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.908
Hey, Coach.

18:03.515 --> 18:06.245
We got a problem.
It's about the camera.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.353
What about the camera?

18:09.421 --> 18:12.447
Uh... one of the assistant
coaches saw Walt Riggins

18:12.958 --> 18:15.688
going in the A.V. room right
before the camera went missing.

18:17.629 --> 18:19.119
Which coach?

18:19.631 --> 18:20.859
Corelli.

18:22.201 --> 18:23.793
Saw Tim Riggins' dad come
out of the A.V. room?

18:23.869 --> 18:24.858
Yep.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.065
Camera was there. He goes in the
room. He comes out. It's gone.

18:29.908 --> 18:31.398
What do you want me to do?

18:36.515 --> 18:38.540
Don't do anything.
I'll take care of it.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.913
Thanks.
Yeah.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.832
How you doing?
Fine. How are you?

19:00.906 --> 19:02.806
Good. Good. Sorry to
bother you at home. Uh...

19:02.875 --> 19:05.070
No, it's not a bother.
What can I do for you?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.304
Well, uh...

19:08.480 --> 19:11.142
We're missing a camera from
the A.V. department.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.422
Well, are you going door to door and
asking all the parents about this?

19:18.490 --> 19:19.548
No, I'm not.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.264
Well, I... I don't know...

19:27.332 --> 19:31.029
Well, I'll tell you, we have a coach
over at the uh... Over at the school.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.832
He saw you walk
out of the, uh...

19:32.905 --> 19:34.805
the A.V. room. So...

19:34.873 --> 19:37.137
He said he doesn't know
where the camera is, Coach.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.402
What else do you need?

19:45.884 --> 19:47.613
All right.
I'm sorry to bother you.

19:47.753 --> 19:50.085
Uh... Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

19:50.155 --> 19:51.747
Hey, Coach?
Yeah?

19:52.357 --> 19:55.554
You go to Bradley's place and ask
his dad if he stole the camera?

19:55.627 --> 19:57.026
No, I didn't do that.

19:57.729 --> 20:00.289
Well, I'm just curious why did
you come to mine then.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.229
I didn't know you were there.
I'm sorry.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.803
Granted he's made some mistakes,
Coach, but that's my father in there.

20:11.476 --> 20:13.706
You're right. I apologize.
I'll see you at practice.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.222
Angela, please.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.952
Earl Stackhouse. He's my buddy.
He needs a front-office girl.

20:28.026 --> 20:30.085
I told him how great you were.

20:30.162 --> 20:33.529
I'm sorry. I mean I know what I said
but I mean in the heat of passion...

20:33.599 --> 20:36.033
Here's hundreds. Here's six,
seven hundred dollars.

20:36.101 --> 20:37.659
Just walking around money,
okay?

20:38.570 --> 20:41.004
Can we just make this easy?

20:42.374 --> 20:43.773
I'm sorry.

20:45.043 --> 20:47.170
You're gonna be all right.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.942
So what was it like?
Your first time?

20:55.120 --> 20:57.088
Do you ever watch
the nature channel?

20:58.323 --> 21:00.587
I'm really...
I'm just kidding.

21:00.659 --> 21:02.388
Okay?
Oh. Okay.

21:06.231 --> 21:08.096
You don't have to do this.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.224
You know that, right?

21:10.402 --> 21:12.962
Yeah, I know that. I just...
I want to.

21:13.038 --> 21:16.405
Because there will always be a steady
stream of horny football players in Dillon.

21:16.475 --> 21:17.908
I can guarantee.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.879
No, that... I mean...

21:22.014 --> 21:23.538
Matt's different
and I really like him.

21:23.615 --> 21:27.176
And he likes me and it's just
the perfect opportunity

21:27.252 --> 21:29.447
for me to control the
whole experience. You know?

21:29.521 --> 21:31.489
Get the information
and gather the data.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.885
Wow. That sounds real hot.

21:37.796 --> 21:41.630
For Matt. Throw the guy a bone
while you're gathering your data.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.898
As soon as it left my hands,
I knew it was bad.

21:48.674 --> 21:51.734
I saw him running and I was the only
one that had a clean shot at him.

21:51.810 --> 21:55.109
And the only thing going through my
head was that I wanted to kill him.

21:55.180 --> 21:57.148
I wanted to obliterate him.

21:58.283 --> 22:01.650
I put my head down
and I went right into him.

22:05.457 --> 22:07.516
I guess the next thing was...

22:08.593 --> 22:10.891
That I came
to a couple minutes later.

22:11.563 --> 22:13.793
And my parents were just
standing over me.

22:13.865 --> 22:16.834
And my dad was just holding
my mom.

22:17.035 --> 22:19.970
She was screaming and
he was crying.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.801
First time I'd ever seen
my dad cry.

22:22.541 --> 22:24.839
And he just kept saying,
"Get up, son. Get up.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.073
"Get up, son. " And...

22:28.747 --> 22:31.841
I wasn't. I couldn't.
Couldn't do it.

22:33.952 --> 22:35.214
I think if...

22:35.687 --> 22:39.783
If it was me I would spend
my whole life wondering why.

22:44.062 --> 22:46.929
Yeah, there's a...
There's a lot of that.

22:47.599 --> 22:49.066
There's a lot of that.

22:49.835 --> 22:52.463
You just get angry,
you know? And...

22:53.972 --> 22:55.701
You start wondering,
you know,

22:55.774 --> 22:58.242
"God, did you do this to me?"
You know? Was it fate?

22:58.310 --> 23:01.074
Was it just some dumb
accident? Was it my fault?

23:03.415 --> 23:07.112
And I prayed and prayed and prayed
and the only answer I ever got was that

23:07.652 --> 23:10.678
I couldn't walk.
I can't walk.

23:11.089 --> 23:12.556
So...

23:13.692 --> 23:15.626
I'm just ready to get rid
of that, you know?

23:15.694 --> 23:17.662
Get rid of that anger,
and just...

23:17.829 --> 23:19.660
Just have some peace.

23:20.198 --> 23:22.189
Hey, "After School Special. "

23:25.103 --> 23:26.593
I wanna show you
something.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.329
This is the best
juke box in town.

23:29.608 --> 23:30.973
You got that right!

23:31.042 --> 23:34.409
How about that? Let's go,
"After School Special. "

23:34.713 --> 23:37.614
Dance party! Dance party.

23:37.682 --> 23:39.582
Oh, yeah!

23:40.852 --> 23:42.012
Wanna get out of here?

23:42.087 --> 23:43.076
Yeah.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.150
What...
What's this one?

23:49.895 --> 23:52.159
Oh, that's the Chinese
symbol for "wealth. "

23:52.230 --> 23:54.790
It's also the Chinese symbol
for "douche. "

23:55.834 --> 23:57.893
Do they have a Chinese symbol
for "crippled?"

23:58.003 --> 23:59.732
No Chinese symbols.

23:59.905 --> 24:03.102
No barbed wire
and no naked ladies.

24:03.408 --> 24:07.572
Just hold on there, shooter. I'm looking
for something. I just can't find it.

24:07.879 --> 24:09.506
This your station?

24:09.581 --> 24:10.946
Yeah, right there.

24:11.016 --> 24:12.745
What's uh...
What's this one?

24:13.118 --> 24:14.107
Which ones?

24:14.186 --> 24:16.484
These uh...
The red, yellow and blue.

24:16.588 --> 24:21.048
Oh. That was the wallpaper in
the hallway at my grandma's house.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.021
Y'all were close?
No!

24:24.095 --> 24:27.587
She was a bitch on wheels and
everyone was glad when she died.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.734
Nice. But I think the
wallpaper was pretty.

24:31.403 --> 24:33.871
Oh, here it is.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.568
Found it.

24:36.675 --> 24:39.508
Sanskrit.
This top one.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.374
It says "peace. "

24:47.953 --> 24:48.942
It's perfect.

25:00.432 --> 25:02.332
How you feeling, buddy?

25:02.601 --> 25:04.034
Want me to cook you up
an omelet?

25:04.102 --> 25:05.467
No, I'm good, Dad.

25:06.738 --> 25:08.797
I'm gonna fix my headlight.

25:34.900 --> 25:38.358
I... I was gonna take
that back. I swear.

25:44.075 --> 25:46.270
I defended you, Dad.
Timmy, this is no big deal.

25:46.344 --> 25:47.333
No, it is.

25:48.813 --> 25:50.303
You know that.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.374
I want you to leave.

25:58.156 --> 25:59.851
Get out!

26:09.634 --> 26:12.068
Okay. You see how easy
this is, son...

26:12.337 --> 26:13.861
Just watch this.

26:45.236 --> 26:46.703
Nuh-uh.

27:27.445 --> 27:29.037
Hey.
Hey.

27:29.114 --> 27:30.775
Did Tyra drive you?

27:30.849 --> 27:32.282
Uh... yeah. Okay.

27:32.350 --> 27:34.875
So my parents think I'm at Lois'
and I need to be home by eleven.

27:34.953 --> 27:37.012
So we should get right down
to the sex then.

27:37.822 --> 27:38.811
Right?

27:40.125 --> 27:41.114
Good.

27:47.766 --> 27:50.564
Where in the bathroom
is the aspirin?

27:50.635 --> 27:53.695
Well, look in the, um...
Underneath the sink.

27:53.938 --> 27:56.634
I poured you some wine.
That might help.

28:02.580 --> 28:05.947
Hey, were you planning
something special for tonight?

28:06.418 --> 28:08.648
Yes, I'm making you a
beautiful dinner.

28:08.787 --> 28:10.550
Just poured you a glass
of wine.

28:10.622 --> 28:13.523
And if you get rid of that
headache, you may get lucky, darling.

28:13.591 --> 28:14.580
What's this?

28:16.027 --> 28:17.119
These yours?
No.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.321
Well, they're sure as hell
not mine.

28:18.396 --> 28:20.990
So what would our 15 year old
daughter be doing with these?

28:21.066 --> 28:22.431
Yeah.

28:23.101 --> 28:26.264
I think I need to talk to you
for a second, hon.

28:28.073 --> 28:29.062
I...

28:29.874 --> 28:33.037
I saw Matt Saracen buying
condoms earlier this week.

28:40.018 --> 28:41.781
I'm sorry.
Say that again.

28:41.853 --> 28:44.151
You heard what I said. Oh, I'd
love to hear you say that again.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.247
No, I'm not gonna say it. And
you were gonna tell me this when?

28:46.324 --> 28:47.382
I talked to Julie about it.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.120
Oh, you did?
Well, yeah. I did.

28:49.194 --> 28:54.063
You did. And did you also tell her that
if he even touches a hair on her head,

28:54.132 --> 28:57.260
that's she's gonna be sent to a nunnery
in Rome and I'm gonna rip his head off

28:57.335 --> 28:58.324
right afterwards?

28:58.403 --> 28:59.995
No. No, but what I told her
is that she's too young

29:00.071 --> 29:03.336
and that she's not ready. And then I
tried to make the best case that I could

29:03.408 --> 29:04.432
against it.

29:04.509 --> 29:06.101
Well, that's good. It might
even help if we get her

29:06.177 --> 29:08.042
her own apartment. 'Cause
that's pretty darn stern.

29:08.113 --> 29:10.775
The reason I didn't consult with you
and I didn't talk to you about it is

29:10.849 --> 29:12.544
because I felt that you
might start to freak out.

29:12.617 --> 29:13.606
Where is she right now?

29:13.685 --> 29:15.880
'Cause I think what you're doing
right now... Where is she right now?

29:15.954 --> 29:18.013
She's at Lois' now.
Studying. Wait. Wait a second.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.579
Hey, how you doing?

29:20.725 --> 29:23.285
This is Coach Taylor. Sir...

29:26.030 --> 29:28.362
Yeah, hey. This is Coach
Taylor. I was just wondering

29:28.433 --> 29:30.025
if my daughter's over there.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.466
Yes, sir.

29:32.837 --> 29:35.465
Do you know if she was planning
on coming over there or...

29:36.641 --> 29:39.576
No, everything's fine.
Okay. Thank you.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.046
Why don't you find out
where our daughter is?

29:55.193 --> 29:56.956
Hey. What are you doing back here?

29:57.061 --> 29:59.325
You're not supposed
to be in the kitchen.

30:01.432 --> 30:02.990
Can you take a break?

30:03.067 --> 30:04.091
No. No.

30:04.169 --> 30:05.727
It's the dinner rush
and you know,

30:05.804 --> 30:07.362
my manager's
breathing down my back.

30:07.438 --> 30:09.872
I got a table full of crazy
middle-aged women.

30:09.941 --> 30:12.171
No, I can't take a break.
I'm sorry.

30:14.546 --> 30:15.877
What?

30:18.049 --> 30:19.277
Forget it.

30:20.518 --> 30:21.780
Tim.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.723
What?

30:32.630 --> 30:34.257
The deer's staring at me.

30:34.799 --> 30:36.164
Deer's...

30:37.168 --> 30:40.160
Well, it's, um...
Don't look at it.

30:42.907 --> 30:44.704
I just... I feel like it's
judging me.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.573
Can... can you cover it
up or something?

30:46.644 --> 30:48.475
Yeah. Here.

30:49.981 --> 30:50.970
Uh...

30:54.018 --> 30:55.451
All right.

30:57.388 --> 30:59.652
Good, see?
Uh... He's asleep now.

31:00.892 --> 31:03.360
See, it's hard not too look at
you 'cause you're so good looking.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.018
There you go.

31:11.769 --> 31:12.963
Is it really hot
in here?

31:13.037 --> 31:14.061
Um...

31:14.138 --> 31:16.800
Yeah, I guess.
You want me to open a window?

31:17.108 --> 31:18.507
Yeah. That'd be really great.

31:18.576 --> 31:20.737
All right. Okay.

31:26.484 --> 31:28.918
Good. Now it's cooler.

31:39.631 --> 31:42.225
Does it smell like wet dog?

31:44.903 --> 31:46.928
You know what?

31:48.606 --> 31:50.369
Let's not do this.

31:50.842 --> 31:53.470
No, no, no, no, no. I...
I told you I want to...

31:53.544 --> 31:56.775
No, no, no, no, no. You really
don't. And that's okay 'cause...

31:57.715 --> 31:59.148
We don't have to.

32:01.185 --> 32:02.846
We... We don't?

32:03.955 --> 32:05.422
No.

32:05.690 --> 32:09.558
We can just hang out or, uh...
Eat, or I don't know. Whatever.

32:12.163 --> 32:13.562
Really?

32:13.831 --> 32:15.355
Yeah.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.899
Oh, but don't touch me
right now. That's...

32:18.303 --> 32:21.136
Just gimme a minute, please.

32:21.506 --> 32:23.098
Yeah. Yeah.

32:35.353 --> 32:36.752
What time is it?

32:51.703 --> 32:55.662
You know, you and I have the exact
same amount of experience being parents.

32:59.344 --> 33:01.209
We've been doing this job

33:01.279 --> 33:03.509
the same number of years

33:03.581 --> 33:05.811
and months and days
as each other

33:05.883 --> 33:08.875
and the truth of it is that
we just don't have any control.

33:08.953 --> 33:11.615
You know? For the most
part, we're just winging it.

33:13.024 --> 33:16.653
And I'm... I don't know what to do. I
don't know what to do in this situation.

33:20.031 --> 33:22.932
But I'll tell you what.
The most important thing to me

33:23.001 --> 33:26.437
is that my daughter
be able to talk to me.

33:28.206 --> 33:31.801
A girl is entitled to that
with her mother.

33:34.278 --> 33:37.338
My mother used to tell me that I was gonna
go to hell if a guy ever even touched me,

33:37.415 --> 33:41.545
and you know that didn't work. I'm
sure as hell not gonna do that to Julie.

33:52.964 --> 33:56.525
And we raised a smart,
responsible,

33:57.635 --> 33:59.466
moral girl.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.701
And I have faith in us.

34:06.411 --> 34:08.038
And I have faith in her.

34:10.982 --> 34:13.507
And now we just gotta
let her go.

34:28.933 --> 34:31.231
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

34:41.012 --> 34:43.981
One, two, three!

34:44.181 --> 34:46.480
Oh, see...
Oh, wait!

34:46.583 --> 34:49.451
No, you gotta keep your
hand... Hey, you're cheating!

34:49.687 --> 34:51.382
I can't win if I don't cheat.

34:51.522 --> 34:54.217
Oh, those... Those are very good
ethics right there. That's great.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.085
Oh, wait.

34:56.726 --> 34:59.560
You have the ugliest feet
I have ever seen.

34:59.630 --> 35:00.824
Oh, shut up!
I do not!

35:00.898 --> 35:02.058
No, you do.
No, they're really gross.

35:02.133 --> 35:05.034
And because... look, your second toe
is all bigger than your first toe.

35:05.203 --> 35:06.397
It's a sign of royalty.

35:06.471 --> 35:07.495
Oh, yeah?

35:07.572 --> 35:09.836
What are you? Like the "Royal
Duchess of Dillon" or something?

35:09.907 --> 35:13.343
Okay. Look who's talking, Mr.
"I Have Dirt AII Over My Feet"!

35:13.411 --> 35:14.605
Well, I mean...

35:14.679 --> 35:16.772
Oh, my God, we were gonna
have sex tonight.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.907
And you didn't even clean
the bottoms of your feet.

35:18.983 --> 35:20.473
I was gonna keep my socks on.

35:20.551 --> 35:21.540
Ew!

35:22.053 --> 35:25.022
Whatever. Come here. Ready?
Let's go. One more time.

35:25.089 --> 35:27.284
Okay. Okay. Ready?
Okay, you ready?

35:27.358 --> 35:29.986
One, two, three!

36:01.592 --> 36:02.650
Hey, Buck.

36:02.727 --> 36:03.751
Amateur hour.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.489
There's that punk kid
from the other night.

36:15.573 --> 36:18.133
Come on, fellas.
Let's have some fun.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.006
Yeah!

36:24.515 --> 36:26.449
He fire you?
Thank you.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.109
Mr. Garrity fired you?
Why?

36:28.186 --> 36:30.518
I really don't want all these
questions with you nagging me...

36:30.621 --> 36:31.645
Did something happen?

36:31.722 --> 36:33.246
Everything. I don't wanna talk
about it right now.

36:34.759 --> 36:35.748
But... I...

36:36.394 --> 36:39.363
Hello?
Hey, Tyra. It's Teresa.

36:39.430 --> 36:42.194
Your boy Tim's here fixing
to get his ass kicked.

36:46.604 --> 36:49.767
Okay. I gotta go. I'll be back.
We're gonna finish this later.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.536
Come on, boy! What's it gonna
be? Huh? What you got for me?

36:52.610 --> 36:54.578
Give him hell, Buck.

37:23.207 --> 37:25.767
Come on, man.
What you got?

37:25.943 --> 37:28.138
Your daddy ain't here to help
you out, huh?

37:44.362 --> 37:45.920
Get the hell off him, man!
Get the hell of him!

37:45.997 --> 37:46.986
What are you doing?

37:47.064 --> 37:48.964
Come on. He's the one
that kept it going!

37:49.033 --> 37:51.297
He's just a kid, man!

38:04.282 --> 38:06.477
Where's that beer?

38:16.927 --> 38:19.521
Hey, um... Jules?

38:20.064 --> 38:21.122
Mmm-hmm?

38:21.198 --> 38:23.359
It's kinda...

38:24.268 --> 38:26.361
It's kinda, um...

38:27.405 --> 38:28.872
Oh, my God.

38:28.939 --> 38:30.497
Oh, my God.
We are so dead.

38:30.608 --> 38:32.633
What do you wanna...
Um...

38:33.611 --> 38:35.135
Kill the lights.

38:39.717 --> 38:40.775
Where are my keys?

38:40.851 --> 38:42.478
You want me to walk you
to the door or something?

38:42.553 --> 38:45.784
Are you kidding me? My dad's
gonna kill you if he sees you.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.480
Where are my keys?

38:47.558 --> 38:49.116
Julie, I love you.

38:54.198 --> 38:55.563
Um... what?

38:56.400 --> 38:57.697
I love you.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.239
Um... Uh... Me, too.

39:06.577 --> 39:08.306
I love you, too.

39:15.786 --> 39:18.016
Um... I'll call you later.

39:18.222 --> 39:20.417
Okay. Bye.

39:22.560 --> 39:23.549
Bye.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.484
Uh...

39:55.559 --> 39:56.583
Are you all right?

39:56.660 --> 39:58.958
Are you all right?
Uh... yeah.

39:59.029 --> 40:00.587
I'm fine. Uh...

40:01.632 --> 40:02.690
I'm sorry. I...

40:02.767 --> 40:04.359
And I know I'm late
and I know I should've called

40:04.435 --> 40:06.494
'cause that's the whole reason
you guys bought me the cell phone

40:06.570 --> 40:08.265
and I'm probably grounded
for the rest of my life.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.432
But I just I was with Matt
and we fell asleep and...

40:10.508 --> 40:13.807
Uh, no, no, no, no.
Nothing like that happened.

40:13.878 --> 40:16.005
Not what you're thinking
happened. 'Cause that didn't happen

40:16.113 --> 40:18.809
and I swear to you guys
that nothing happened,

40:24.054 --> 40:25.282
Good night.

40:33.864 --> 40:36.594
And, uh... Yeah. um...

40:37.735 --> 40:41.671
But, um...
Thanks for the talk.

40:48.512 --> 40:49.501
Good night.

41:10.868 --> 41:13.393
Seeing the cross
of sacrifice

41:13.471 --> 41:16.406
and the empty tomb,
we rejoice

41:16.507 --> 41:19.340
in the awesome
love of our lord, Jesus.

41:20.010 --> 41:23.343
And we take comfort
in the eternal forgiveness

41:23.481 --> 41:26.450
that God gives to all
who believe in Jesus

41:26.584 --> 41:27.949
and walk with him.

41:28.819 --> 41:32.118
Let us go in peace and
serve the Lord.

41:33.090 --> 41:35.149
Amen
Amen. Amen.

41:36.360 --> 41:39.193
So I was thinking. You know
when we're at the, uh...

41:39.263 --> 41:42.357
The store, we could get a
newspaper. Look through the want ads.

41:43.701 --> 41:45.862
Or you know we could go
see a movie.

41:45.936 --> 41:48.769
That might, you know,
make you feel better.

41:49.673 --> 41:52.107
What? Where are we going?

41:52.610 --> 41:54.874
Mother...
What are we doing here?

41:54.945 --> 41:56.310
Mom. Mom!

41:56.380 --> 41:57.404
Just stay in the car.

41:57.481 --> 41:58.846
What... What?

41:58.916 --> 42:00.406
Stay in the car I said!

42:03.254 --> 42:05.779
What are you doing? Momma?

42:07.591 --> 42:09.991
Mother? Momma?

42:10.794 --> 42:12.625
Hey! Buddy!

42:12.897 --> 42:14.455
Oh, God! Oh...

42:14.532 --> 42:16.159

42:16.233 --> 42:17.860

42:17.935 --> 42:20.096

let me keep the job!

42:27.778 --> 42:29.678
It's all right.

42:34.151 --> 42:36.051
What were you thinking?

42:48.465 --> 42:50.092
Pam.

43:29.073 --> 43:31.166
What the hell happened to you?

43:32.977 --> 43:34.535

43:37.281 --> 43:39.442
I brought you something.

43:43.287 --> 43:45.050
You all right?

43:49.326 --> 43:50.759
Why don't you come inside?

43:50.961 --> 43:52.758
See you at practice.
