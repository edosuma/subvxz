00:01.084 --> 00:03.336
NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.420 --> 00:06.464
-FAY: Frank, I want you to meet--
-Hal Massey. Pleasure.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.425
Oh, it goes double for me too, Frank.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.010
You heard from your old lady?

00:10.093 --> 00:12.262
Yeah, she called me last night from LA.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.764
J.D.: It's none of my business, right?
But Hollywood?

00:14.848 --> 00:17.434
Man, those guys
will just be all over that chick.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.185
(clears throat)
Unless I'm terribly mistaken,

00:19.269 --> 00:20.895
Frank Jr. already has a father figure.

00:20.979 --> 00:24.399
Believe me, nothing is going to change
between you and Little Frank.

00:24.482 --> 00:25.608
His name is Frank Jr.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.944
Sir Renko, Jerry Nash.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.946
I used to work with this guy down
at Jefferson Heights.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.740
(clamoring)

00:31.823 --> 00:33.783
-(man screaming)
-Hey, Jerry!

00:33.867 --> 00:35.660
MAN: Oh, man! He'll kill me.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.287
One of your clients accused of assault?

00:37.370 --> 00:38.621
Victim of an assault...

00:39.456 --> 00:40.623
by a police officer.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.293
JOYCE: Jerry Nash stepped way
out of bounds on this one.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.337
He was going crazy,
like angel dust or something.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.423
JERRY:
He popped me in the eye. I popped him.

00:48.506 --> 00:49.799
Is that how it happened, Bobby?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.968
It was reasonable and necessary.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.472
Bobby, you're asking me to cover for a guy
that I hardly even know.

00:55.555 --> 00:59.517
We're talking about doing now
could lead to perjury.

00:59.601 --> 01:04.105
We may cover for you, but none of us
are going back out on the street with you.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.777
(indistinct chatter)

01:08.860 --> 01:14.074
Item nine, as regards the deplorable
spelling being found in this precinct.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.868
-(all laughing)
-Especially disturbing here

01:16.951 --> 01:20.872
is the recent increase in errors
on your Form 1506 salmon,

01:20.955 --> 01:25.877
1596 salmon,
your traffic citation 943 mint.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.297
So, please, uh, note.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.551
-PHIL: "Black male," person...
-Say, Renko. I want to see you upstairs.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.012
...and "blackmail," the crime.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.140
(laughing)

01:39.224 --> 01:41.935
Men, these common mistakes,

01:42.393 --> 01:44.604
besides being highly debatable
comprehension-wise,

01:44.687 --> 01:45.772
can only make an impression

01:45.855 --> 01:48.483
on the public's perception
of our intelligence...

01:48.983 --> 01:53.113
that I might characterize
as, uh, negative in the<i> extremis.</i>

01:53.196 --> 01:55.532
PHIL: So, uh, what say, huh, guys?

01:55.615 --> 01:57.283
Scribble 'em down on the back
of your Miranda cards

01:57.367 --> 01:59.911
and let's get 'em right next time.

02:00.328 --> 02:01.412
Scribble.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.333
Item 10 is the union situation.

02:05.416 --> 02:08.128
-(groaning)
-MAN: Not again.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.923
PHIL: Word is the, uh, city got down
to serious bargaining yesterday.

02:12.006 --> 02:15.426
-(cheering)
-But let's not raise any expectations.

02:15.510 --> 02:20.682
Let's not put down any $1,000 deposits
on Caribbean love nests yet.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.977
(chattering)

02:24.060 --> 02:27.105
PHIL: All right. Listen up.
Operation Cash and Carry.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.982
Be apprised that, uh,

02:29.065 --> 02:33.194
there are now 73 day-night
automated tellers in the city,

02:33.278 --> 02:34.529
six of them on the Hill.

02:34.612 --> 02:38.825
Customers at all six have been hit
by a gang of perpetrators,

02:38.908 --> 02:41.703
operating out of a dark-colored,
late-model van.

02:42.412 --> 02:45.832
As of 9:00 a.m. this morning,
half a dozen of our finest

02:45.915 --> 02:48.209
will commence undercover surveillance.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.044
-(groaning)
-MAN: All right.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.296
The last item...

02:52.922 --> 02:56.593
is, uh, the subject of organ donation.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.928
-Which one?
-The one you don't use.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.471
(laughing)

03:00.555 --> 03:04.934
As of Friday,
the Greater Metropolitan Vital Organ Bank

03:05.018 --> 03:09.105
had received only three donor cards
from this precinct.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.274
-(groaning)
-One of said cards,

03:11.357 --> 03:13.484
albeit proffered
by the anonymous donor with,

03:13.568 --> 03:15.570
I doubt, the best of intentions,

03:15.653 --> 03:19.949
-listed only an unmentionable.
-(laughing)

03:20.033 --> 03:22.327
PHIL: And according to Ms. Wyshanski
of said bank,

03:22.410 --> 03:24.662
unusable organ of reproduction.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.915
(laughing)

03:27.332 --> 03:32.003
Now, guys, cognizant as I am
of the natural reluctance

03:32.086 --> 03:37.383
to, uh, part with one's vital organs,
even an extremity,

03:37.467 --> 03:40.011
nevertheless, I might point out that

03:40.803 --> 03:44.057
you're not donating a part of your body
to keep a stranger alive.

03:44.140 --> 03:48.061
He or she is donating
nearly everything else

03:48.478 --> 03:50.271
to keep a part of you alive.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.482
-MAN: That's a good one.
-Right. Right.

03:52.565 --> 03:56.194
-(indistinct chatter)
-(applause)

03:56.611 --> 03:58.863
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.492
And, hey. Hey.

04:03.701 --> 04:05.286
Let's be careful out there.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.621
MAN: All right.

04:06.704 --> 04:10.124
(chattering)

04:15.880 --> 04:18.049
Say, Renko, how are those reports coming?

04:18.132 --> 04:20.927
They'll be on the captain's desk at 9:00,
as promised.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.472
Hey, you two, report time. Let's hit it.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.854
-Belker.
-MAN: Belker.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.106
Thank you.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.566
Come on, move it.
We're still in the same place.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.943
Come on! Come on!

04:37.652 --> 04:39.904
Move it. Out of my way.

04:40.071 --> 04:40.989
Watch it.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.825
-Can I help you, ma'am?
-I wanna see Belker.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.578
-Oh, there he is.
-Lady, you can't just walk in there.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.539
Out of my way, hairball.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.964
All right, mother's maiden name.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.049
Bailey, Pearl.

05:00.591 --> 05:01.551
WOMAN: They don't want to go.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.887
What do you mean they don't want to go?

05:04.971 --> 05:06.389
I just talked to her.

05:06.472 --> 05:09.642
In three days,
the cruise leaves, paid in full,

05:09.726 --> 05:11.185
and she says to me,

05:11.269 --> 05:14.689
"Luana, we'd be happier
if you and your brother went."

05:15.940 --> 05:18.568
BELKER: All right, it's very simple.

05:18.651 --> 05:23.573
You go back to her, you say to her,
"Ma, Mick and I love you both very much.

05:23.656 --> 05:29.078
But if you and Dad don't get on that boat,
I'm gonna break both your legs."

05:29.245 --> 05:30.913
Why do I have to do it?

05:31.247 --> 05:34.917
I'm on a very big undercover operation
today, so forget it.

05:35.376 --> 05:38.838
What's the matter, you got amnesia,
how to pick up a telephone or what?

05:40.298 --> 05:41.424
What's this?

05:48.139 --> 05:49.390
Is this what I think it is?

05:49.474 --> 05:52.185
Just keep your hands off
the evidence, hairbag.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.937
Hey. Hey, those are sexual appliances.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.274
(buzzing)

06:02.111 --> 06:06.115
-(buzzing continues)
-Oh, it heats up, too.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.243
-(stops buzzing)
-(growling)

06:11.704 --> 06:13.664
(growling continues)

06:14.999 --> 06:18.586
How would you like me to tear out
both your lungs, dog breath?

06:19.212 --> 06:21.923
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:22.006 --> 06:23.716
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:23.800 --> 06:27.762
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:27.845 --> 06:29.389
(sirens wailing)

06:34.852 --> 06:38.773
(theme music playing)

07:37.540 --> 07:39.750
We're doing our best to expedite it,
Jerry.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.003
Internal Affairs should have the paperwork
by tomorrow morning.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.338
Excuse me, Francis,
if I could interrupt for one moment.

07:44.422 --> 07:48.259
-Your lunch for Hal Massey today.
-Oh, Phil, I forgot.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.219
I made plans to have lunch
with Howard Hunter.

07:50.845 --> 07:54.765
May I suggest a wiser course
politics-wise, familial-wise

07:54.849 --> 07:56.934
-and otherwise?
-Okay. Okay, you're right.

07:57.018 --> 08:00.313
What the heck. I'll take Howard with me.
We'll kill two birds with one stone.

08:00.396 --> 08:03.774
-I'll call Fay and reserve another place.
-Great. Thanks, Phil.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.114
-You know the route from there, right?
-Hmm?

08:10.198 --> 08:12.325
Well, Internal Affairs will come here
or you'll go there,

08:12.408 --> 08:13.493
depending on your schedule.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.410
Oh, yeah.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.246
You gonna get a lawyer?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.290
That'd just make me look guilty.

08:20.374 --> 08:22.543
To tell you the truth,
I don't feel that I need one.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.088
Frank, you know I'm real sorry
this whole thing happened.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.715
I know you are, Jer. So am I.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.677
-MAN: Whoa! Whoa!
-(shouting)

08:32.345 --> 08:35.139
Oh, I'm really sorry, man. You okay?

08:35.556 --> 08:39.227
Good. Hey, Captain, I just slipped.

08:40.937 --> 08:41.854
Man.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.857
I'll get a broom.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.818
I'll clean it up.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.155
I'll be right back.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.075
Some days, huh, Frank?

08:54.825 --> 08:57.245
-Oh, uh, there's one other thing, Jerry.
-Hmm?

08:57.995 --> 08:59.163
Are you moonlighting?

09:00.706 --> 09:03.042
Oh, just a couple of hours, that's all.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.545
We both know that's against the book.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.797
Well, I gotta do something.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.341
I got ends to make meet. I gotta...

09:10.716 --> 09:13.052
I gotta hire somebody to take
care of my kids, and--

09:13.886 --> 09:15.263
(sighs)

09:15.471 --> 09:17.974
It seems like I'm damned if I do
and damned if I don't.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.852
You mean this stuff's not bulletproof?

09:24.230 --> 09:25.898
A moment of your time, Captain.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.400
Sure.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.235
I guess that's all, Jerry.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.368
(sighs)

09:37.451 --> 09:39.954
Doesn't look like a skull-buster,
I'll grant you that.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.249
-Are you here about him?
-These.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.709
These.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.087
(sighs) Are these all yours?

09:50.131 --> 09:51.591
JOYCE: Take a look, pizza man.

09:52.133 --> 09:56.387
I don't know anything about these, Joyce.
The night officer was on duty.

09:58.264 --> 10:03.311
Loitering. Public urination.
Peeping Tom. Littering. Littering?

10:04.353 --> 10:06.731
Was last night the coldest night
of the year by 10 degrees,

10:06.814 --> 10:08.357
or am I Kurt Waldheim?

10:09.650 --> 10:12.945
They're your classic cold-weather busts,
Furillo, admit it.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.115
Temperature drops,
wind chill's up off the river,

10:16.198 --> 10:18.659
time to comb the alleys
for a misdemeanoring bum.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.412
Well, we did have quite a few officers

10:21.495 --> 10:23.247
out on foot patrol last night,
that's true.

10:23.331 --> 10:28.210
So, uh, do you suppose we could maybe
short-circuit the Mickey Mouse right here?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.212
The taxpayers could use the savings.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.549
And I'd like to get out of court
and have dinner with a cop tonight.

10:34.050 --> 10:34.884
Oh?

10:34.967 --> 10:37.511
You know, the two of us ought
to stay in from out of the cold.

10:37.595 --> 10:41.849
Well, I'm not promising anything,
Counselor, but I'll ask Ray-- Henry.

10:44.518 --> 10:48.814
Henry, uh, could you find Ray for me,
please?

10:49.190 --> 10:50.399
Yeah, sure.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.240
It is supposed to be chilly tonight.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.536
-See you about 6:30, pizza man.
-(glass crunching)

11:04.372 --> 11:05.831
(sighs)

11:06.791 --> 11:08.668
-You know what this place needs?
-Hmm?

11:08.751 --> 11:09.919
A repairman.

11:19.303 --> 11:23.766
I wish this union we paid all these dues
to would get us some money, you know?

11:23.849 --> 11:27.687
Say, with what you owe,
it will hardly scratch the surface.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.897
I don't know how a guy like Nash does it.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.067
I mean, I'm a single guy,
I don't pay a whole lot of rent

11:33.150 --> 11:36.487
and I sure don't spend all my money
on clothes like you Afro-Americans.

11:36.570 --> 11:37.446
-(siren blaring)
-Yeah.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.950
You know, I don't know where
your whole paycheck goes, cowboy.

11:41.033 --> 11:44.370
I mean, it would be one thing
if you spent $4,000 on a Harley

11:44.453 --> 11:46.122
or a share in a powerboat

11:46.205 --> 11:51.335
or, um, pay $200 on a pair of snakeskin
cowboy boots

11:51.419 --> 11:53.087
direct from Houston, Texas,
that don't fit--

11:53.170 --> 11:54.213
Will you please stop?

11:54.296 --> 11:56.924
Or if you fell in love
with your creative writing teacher

11:57.007 --> 11:59.135
and bought a $600 electric typewriter
that's still in the box.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.011
Do you have to get
into emotional things now?

12:01.095 --> 12:05.182
Or paid $1,500
for a set of contour weights.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.393
You know, you're starting to depress me,
Bobby.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.061
It's worse than being married.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.274
I'm just a 31-year-old white man
trying to make my way in the world.

12:13.357 --> 12:15.359
-Oh.
-They won't pay me nothing.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.112
DISPATCHER (on radio):<i> Eastside Park</i>
<i>units, we got a vehicular, mid 600 block.</i>

12:18.195 --> 12:20.197
-Forget about it.
-Oh, come on, cowboy.

12:20.281 --> 12:23.951
Uh, Unit 2202 on that Van Buren vehicular,
we're close.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.619
-We'll cover. Over.
<i>-</i>DISPATCHER:<i> Roger, 2202.</i>

12:25.703 --> 12:28.539
Bobby, I'm too depressed
talking about my financial condition

12:28.622 --> 12:30.666
to get involved in crime fightin' now.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.626
My husband's gonna put a dent in you!

12:32.710 --> 12:34.003
Listen, you shouldn't have been backing up
like that!

12:34.086 --> 12:36.505
If you think you're going someplace,
you got another mistake coming,

12:36.589 --> 12:39.717
-'cause I got your license.
-You're lying like a rug, boy!

12:39.800 --> 12:41.886
Just because you look like Tarzan
don't mean you have to talk like him!

12:41.969 --> 12:44.805
Don't call me names
and don't point your finger at me!

12:44.889 --> 12:46.307
-I'll point at you!
-Hey!

12:46.390 --> 12:49.310
Please, now! Everybody keep quiet!
The fast dancing's over.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.645
Get back to your car.
License and registration, all around.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.522
Come on. License and registration.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.066
Listen. Right here, see? William Teacher.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.818
Now, see, she come out the alley,
she didn't even stop to take a look!

12:57.902 --> 13:00.404
-He's lying like a rug, boy!
-You saw it. You saw it.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.364
I ain't gonna listen to you with "boy"!

13:02.448 --> 13:03.741
I said you be quiet.

13:03.824 --> 13:06.619
And, you, hey,
don't you be calling him boy, number one,

13:06.702 --> 13:09.205
and number two,
you get your license and registration.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.166
-All right, partner.
-Back there. Take a seat.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.461
Y'all hear me? Get out--

13:15.878 --> 13:20.090
(laughing) Look at this, stoned again.
Get out of the car. Get out here.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.300
Now just stand up here.

13:22.092 --> 13:23.052
You know what?

13:23.135 --> 13:25.221
It looks like you need
a little bit more sleep.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.390
A little more sleep, a little less of that
pharmaceutical you've been ingesting.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.350
Go over here.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.394
Stay right there.
I said, stay right there!

13:32.478 --> 13:33.687
(indistinct chatter)

13:33.771 --> 13:34.855
Don't you come off of there.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.192
Hey, looks like we got a real junkyard
mess here, don't it?

13:39.860 --> 13:43.280
Hey, if you're so interested
in looking at this,

13:43.364 --> 13:45.449
why don't you go home
and get a dustpan and a broom

13:45.533 --> 13:47.159
and come back
and y'all give me a hand, huh?

13:47.243 --> 13:48.994
I'll sweep you up, honky.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.163
Hey, why don't you climb
into that refrigerator and close it?

13:51.247 --> 13:53.374
I have two ambulances comin'
from County Medical.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.501
-You all want to sign--
-Hey, he's got a pipe!

13:56.502 --> 13:57.753
You get over here!

14:03.133 --> 14:04.385
Man, looks like you saved my head.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.432
MAN: On the sidewalk. Get back.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.393
See, we're trying to get the traffic
through here before Christmas.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.812
What's gonna happen is this,
you have to get an inspection.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.355
Here's the slip.
It'll be in about two weeks.

14:16.438 --> 14:17.565
This one's uninsured.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.942
Look, I got insurance, man.
Believe it, I got it.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.027
The computer says no.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.864
When did you get that insurance,
Mr. Teacher?

14:24.947 --> 14:28.117
Look, I just paid last week.
I swear, man. Look, it went like this.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.412
I had insurance, but then when they
canceled it, I had to get the other.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.291
Mr. Teacher, I really hate to tell you
this, and I hate to do this to you,

14:35.374 --> 14:37.918
but, uh, I can overlook
this inspection here,

14:38.002 --> 14:42.298
this taillight and so on and so forth,
but uninsured is a criminal misdemeanor.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.633
That is V.T.L. 427 of the criminal code.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.052
And I'm afraid me and my partner here
are gonna have to take you in.

14:47.136 --> 14:50.055
Oh, man! Look, man, I got it at home,
I swear.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.432
Look, I got kids.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.225
I got three kids and a wife
I got to support.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.936
Now if I go downtown,
I'll lose my job, and I go on welfare.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.187
Now what good's that?

14:58.564 --> 14:59.773
RENKO: No good at all.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.483
Look, I'll tell you what.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.528
You come down this afternoon about 4:00,
4:30 to the station house.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.072
You bring proof of your insurance,
and I'll take care of you.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.741
-You got that?
-I got it. I'll be there at 4:00.

15:08.824 --> 15:09.783
You got it, man.

15:10.159 --> 15:14.538
-All right. Thank you for saving my head.
-Oh, hey, nothing to it. All right.

15:38.771 --> 15:43.609
-COMPUTER:<i> Hello. How are you today?</i>
-Nice. Nice. How's about you?

15:43.692 --> 15:46.362
<i>I am here to help you</i>
<i>with all your banking needs.</i>

15:46.445 --> 15:47.446
<i>What would you like to do today,</i>

15:47.529 --> 15:51.408
<i>get cash, make deposit, pay bill,</i>
<i>cancel transaction?</i>

15:52.660 --> 15:54.411
Very nice of you to offer, though.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.081
<i>Thank you. I'm very happy to serve you.</i>

15:57.164 --> 15:59.625
<i>-Have a nice day.</i>
-Thank you. You too.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.461
I mean it.

16:18.143 --> 16:21.271
<i>-</i>COMPUTER:<i> Hello. How are you today?</i>
-I'm fine. How are you today?

16:21.355 --> 16:23.440
<i>I'm here to help you</i>
<i>with all your banking needs.</i>

16:23.524 --> 16:25.275
Excuse me, Sarge.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.904
Could you just toss me that pliers
in the box there on the desk for a second?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.698
-Hey, Phil?
-Hmm?

16:31.740 --> 16:33.784
It really helps with a little cooperation.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.829
This William Teacher
with the moving truck?

16:37.955 --> 16:40.499
Computer just spit out
a felony warrant on him.

16:40.874 --> 16:42.543
The guy that saved Renko's head?

16:42.626 --> 16:46.797
1976, A &amp; B, Missouri warrant,
Kansas City.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.883
Oh, what a shame.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.970
You know, a guy like that, I'd like to see
him get a citizen's citation.

16:53.053 --> 16:54.596
-Pick up this guy, will you?
-(clanking)

16:54.680 --> 16:56.140
Yeah, sure, Sarge.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.610
So how's Jill doing out there
in fat-cat land?

17:08.694 --> 17:10.029
Copacetic, man.

17:10.779 --> 17:13.323
She's out all the time,
going here, going there.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.658
Mm-hmm.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.243
You know, I think, uh,

17:17.578 --> 17:19.538
she really needs all this time to herself.

17:19.621 --> 17:20.539
Yeah.

17:21.498 --> 17:24.668
-So, when's she make the cover of<i> Ebony</i>?
-Hey, come on, man, would you?

17:24.752 --> 17:26.503
She's gonna be back in eight days.

17:26.962 --> 17:28.088
Uh-huh.

17:29.798 --> 17:33.052
-Hey, what's the weather like out there?
-Hey, good, man. Good. Good.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.346
You haven't even talked to her,
have you, man?

17:36.430 --> 17:37.848
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:37.931 --> 17:41.518
Man, now look, I don't... I don't know.
I mean, uh, the time differences.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.313
You know,
by the time you get it straightened out,

17:45.314 --> 17:46.148
I call her up,

17:46.565 --> 17:47.608
her girlfriend says
she's either in the shower--

17:47.691 --> 17:50.944
Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.
And she doesn't return your calls, right?

17:51.028 --> 17:53.822
Come on, man, she's pressuring you
into marriage is what she's doing.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.867
No, no. Now come on, J.D.
It's not like that with me and Jill.

17:56.950 --> 18:00.204
Oh, yeah, right. You're beyond all
that petty possessive stuff, right?

18:00.287 --> 18:03.749
-How'd you know?
-(whistling)

18:03.832 --> 18:05.292
Hey, cut it out, man, would you?

18:06.001 --> 18:08.504
-Come on, J.D., cut it out.
-(scoffs)

18:24.978 --> 18:26.230
William Teacher?

18:26.313 --> 18:28.649
We're police officers.
We've got a warrant for your arrest.

18:32.653 --> 18:37.199
Look, I told the man that--
I said 4:00 I'd be coming in.

18:37.741 --> 18:38.659
WILLIAM: All right.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.370
Um... (chuckles)

18:41.954 --> 18:44.498
Doreen, take these packages back
upstairs for me, will you?

18:45.290 --> 18:47.709
-Let him go now. He didn't hurt nobody.
-Hey, chuckmeat.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.046
Why don't you, uh,
get back in your cellophane pack.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.756
He ain't going no place.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.258
(chattering)

18:54.341 --> 18:58.178
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Everything's cool. Everything's cool.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.972
Just... Just parking tickets.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.224
Listen, let me just say goodbye
to my little ones

19:02.307 --> 19:03.892
and we can be on my way, okay?

19:05.769 --> 19:08.480
Hugs and kisses all the way around, okay?
Here we are.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.987
Come on, give Daddy a hug.
All right. Give me a hug.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.030
Give me a hug. Come on. Give me a big hug.

19:19.074 --> 19:22.536
Take all these packages back upstairs
and don't worry about a thing, okay?

19:22.619 --> 19:24.496
I'll be calling you in an hour, all right?

19:49.438 --> 19:51.440
Judas H., Frank, I'm disappointed as heck.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.484
I thought we were gonna have a
chance to sit down<i> mano a mano</i>,

19:54.568 --> 19:58.071
and, you know, chew the emotional bacon,
as it were.

19:58.155 --> 20:01.617
-We'll chew it tomorrow, Howard.
-No, let's just forget it.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.410
Don't pout, Howard.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.666
Aren't you hungry?

20:10.334 --> 20:13.045
I'm all right. I just have
a little indigestion. It's okay.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.130
You're not gonna eat that?

20:22.262 --> 20:26.183
-(microphone feedback)
-Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

20:27.434 --> 20:32.231
as you know we're not just here for the
chicken à la rubber.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.733
(laughing)

20:34.816 --> 20:38.612
As all of you who paid
your $25 are well aware.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.699
I, uh, I'd liked to take a moment now

20:43.367 --> 20:44.910
to introduce to you

20:45.535 --> 20:47.955
a man of the people,

20:48.705 --> 20:49.915
for the people,

20:50.624 --> 20:53.585
and most of all, for the children.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.674
Our friend, a member of the school board,

20:59.299 --> 21:01.385
who in four short years

21:02.010 --> 21:04.388
has brought the paper-shufflers

21:04.471 --> 21:07.557
and backroom bigots of this city to heel.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.727
A man dedicated to uplifting the poor.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.771
A fighter, ladies and gentlemen.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.691
May I, Hal Massey.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.276
(applause)

21:19.569 --> 21:20.487
Hal, get up.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.580
(clears throat)
If I'm not off in ten minutes,

21:30.664 --> 21:32.708
somebody ring the bell for recess.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.590
I really thank all of you
for coming today.

21:42.926 --> 21:45.887
And I would like to hit hard once again...

21:47.931 --> 21:49.891
on the one thing that I think is important

21:49.975 --> 21:55.022
in mine or anyone else's election
to this board two weeks from Thursday.

21:57.399 --> 22:02.946
The administration in Washington
has thrown down a gauntlet

22:04.156 --> 22:07.159
to, uh, local communities
across the nation,

22:08.118 --> 22:09.536
take care of your own.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.040
Well, I propose that we do just that.

22:17.502 --> 22:22.758
(clears throat)
I know the wretched slums of our city

22:23.508 --> 22:26.219
like, like the back of my hand.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.932
I know the most blameless

22:31.975 --> 22:35.979
of all ignorance comes from growing up
on Jefferson Avenue.

22:36.063 --> 22:36.980
-HAL: I know...
-Judas Priest.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.232
He's bleeding all over the floor, Frank.

22:39.316 --> 22:43.070
-(shushes) Calm down.
-I can't calm down about that, Frank.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.739
HAL: And I know something
can be done with it.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.532
Something bold

22:48.700 --> 22:49.951
and compassionate

22:51.703 --> 22:52.954
and courageous.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.667
And I just want to say one thing
to all of you.

22:59.836 --> 23:03.382
Oh, boy, I'm not feeling very well.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.843
(murmuring)

23:09.262 --> 23:13.725
FAY: Hal? Oh, Hal!

23:16.353 --> 23:17.562
My God, he's dead.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.866
-Did you see some of this stuff?
-Yeah, I saw it.

23:31.034 --> 23:32.702
Just don't pull that string.

23:33.286 --> 23:36.164
-What do you know about this stuff?
-(hissing)

23:36.248 --> 23:38.667
-I told you not to pull the string.
-I didn't even touch it.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.253
-I said not to pull it, that's all.
-How do you stop it?

23:41.336 --> 23:45.841
-She's yours. Now she's yours.
-(laughing)

23:45.924 --> 23:47.884
-Hey, how do you stop it?
-(wolf whistle)

23:47.968 --> 23:52.806
-All right, Joe.
-(laughing continues)

23:53.515 --> 23:55.934
-Hey! Hey, man!
-Come on, you guys. Let's move it.

23:56.017 --> 23:59.271
(shouting continues)

24:00.188 --> 24:03.150
A man like that,
tries to do things to help people?

24:04.234 --> 24:07.320
-Young man, 52 years old.
-Fifty-two?

24:09.114 --> 24:10.157
What'd he fall in?

24:11.783 --> 24:13.618
Uh, chipped beef, supposedly.

24:13.702 --> 24:17.164
Uh-uh. Actually, I heard it
was eggs Benedict, Henry.

24:17.789 --> 24:21.001
-Eggs Benedict? You sure?
-It's what I heard.

24:22.085 --> 24:23.420
Oh, I think you're wrong, Ray.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.673
Eggs Benedict is more, uh, brunch menu.

24:26.756 --> 24:29.509
-Yeah.
-I've eaten it at lunch.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.137
You're not a native to this country, Ray,

24:32.220 --> 24:36.308
so don't pontificate about what
a proper luncheon menu is at a function.

24:36.391 --> 24:39.227
Chipped beef
is not a proper menu anywhere.

24:39.311 --> 24:42.814
Uh, gentlemen,
I was there. It was beef stroganoff.

24:43.356 --> 24:44.274
See?

24:44.816 --> 24:49.196
By me,
beef stroganoff is not chipped beef.

24:49.946 --> 24:51.948
Could we get some work done around here?

24:59.581 --> 25:02.751
What, that thing in Kansas City?
You got to be jivin', bro.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.086
Some white dudes start throwing stuff
around in the bar.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.046
One nearly kills Doreen.

25:06.129 --> 25:08.423
What am I supposed to do, just sit there?
Look, this isn't no Russia.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.133
Hold it. Hey, Sarge. Sarge.

25:11.676 --> 25:12.928
There's your William Teacher, Sarge.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.804
Tell you the truth,
we think he's a pretty good dude.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.890
Yeah, the guy's a saint, Sarge.

25:29.819 --> 25:31.446
Francis, how's Fay?

25:31.530 --> 25:36.076
For someone whose entire life has just
come crashing in on her, she's okay.

25:36.493 --> 25:37.827
She's still at the hospital.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.038
Shouldn't you have stayed with her?

25:40.580 --> 25:42.040
She didn't want me, Phil.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.628
You know, LaRue and Washington

25:46.711 --> 25:49.965
just picked up this William Teacher,
the alleged fugitive.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.717
Um, they'd like a few words with you.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.807
You know, Francis, there seems
to be some rather strong sentiment

25:58.890 --> 26:00.892
amongst the men that,

26:01.226 --> 26:06.648
well, perhaps this is a situation that,
uh, we don't want to be responsible for.

26:11.194 --> 26:14.239
Also, did you look over the reports
on the Jerry Nash incident?

26:14.322 --> 26:15.490
Why?

26:16.658 --> 26:21.788
Well, it just seemed to me,
shall we say, uh, contrivance-wise.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.624
Yeah. It seemed to me, too.

26:27.669 --> 26:30.422
Francis, can I get you some mocha java?

26:35.969 --> 26:38.179
Yes. Please.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.316
-Captain?
-Yes, J.D.

26:49.774 --> 26:53.194
-Uh, about that guy...
-William Teacher?

26:53.278 --> 26:55.614
Yeah. He's an okay dude, Captain.

26:55.697 --> 26:58.199
He kind of helped us
out of a big jackpot today.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.785
Why are you telling me this?

27:02.245 --> 27:04.539
I thought you might want the information,
Captain.

27:06.374 --> 27:07.542
What difference does it make?

27:07.626 --> 27:10.587
Made a big difference out on that street
this afternoon, Captain.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.384
Hey, look what some sadist
did to your girlfriend.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.471
Oh, no! Look what they done to Marlene.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.473
(in high-pitched voice)
I love you. I love you, Andy.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.058
-(normal voice) I love you, too, Marlene.
-Bobby.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.143
-You wanna--
-Renko.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.896
Say, Jerry, have you heard anything
from Internal Affairs yet?

27:28.521 --> 27:30.649
Uh, well, they're gonna go
over the paperwork tomorrow morning.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.862
Renko, I want you to know I really
appreciate your covering for me on this.

27:36.780 --> 27:40.241
Well, I wasn't covering for you, Nash.
I was covering for my partner.

27:42.577 --> 27:43.453
Right.

27:45.455 --> 27:48.166
LARUE: Excuse me,
you two handsome leather devils.

27:48.249 --> 27:49.459
What's up, son?

27:51.878 --> 27:54.047
-You know that guy, Teacher?
-Yeah, what about him?

27:54.130 --> 27:56.007
-Had to pick him up.
-It's about a warrant in Kansas City.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.718
You picked him up? You mean he's in there?
They got no couth around here.

27:58.802 --> 28:01.680
That guy saved my skull this morning.
He saved my skull.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.390
-Yeah, mine, too, lover.
-Hey, hey. Get out of my way, you hussy!

28:03.473 --> 28:05.975
Just get out of my way.
You too, out of my way. Leo!

28:06.559 --> 28:08.561
Hey, Leo, you holding a guy named Teacher?

28:08.645 --> 28:10.730
I'm about to bust somebody's arm
out their socket.

28:10.814 --> 28:11.981
Hey, man, I'm sorry. I'm real, real sorry.

28:12.065 --> 28:12.941
Hey, bro.

28:13.024 --> 28:14.401
Hey, come on, get him out of here, please.

28:14.484 --> 28:15.902
Hey, look, they just come pick me up.

28:15.985 --> 28:18.154
Warrant five years old.
Never were nothing to it.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.031
You know, if you done something wrong,
you better tell me right now.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.700
I got nothing to hide.
Just help me get home to my kids.

28:21.783 --> 28:25.161
You just better tell me right now.
Get him out of here. Get him out of here.

28:26.121 --> 28:29.499
Hey, Wash, uh,
is everything okay with you and Jill?

28:29.582 --> 28:30.875
Yeah, man, of course.

28:31.876 --> 28:34.212
Why wouldn't everything be
okay with me and Jill, huh?

28:34.295 --> 28:35.380
Well, I don't know.

28:35.463 --> 28:38.299
Except, Denise and I
were out at McHendrick's last night

28:38.383 --> 28:39.718
and ran into Jill and her girlfriend.

28:40.176 --> 28:44.180
So, you know, I said,
"How you doing, babe? What's happening?"

28:45.014 --> 28:47.517
She turned around and practically ran out
of the place.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.438
Well, no wonder the chick
acted weird, man. That wasn't Jill.

28:51.855 --> 28:54.482
Wash, hey, man,
how many times have we been out together?

28:54.566 --> 28:57.402
-I know Jill.
-Hey, Bobby, you may know Jill,

28:57.485 --> 28:59.487
but Jill happens to be in Los Angeles
this week.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.614
Has been since last week
and will be till next week.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.783
Wait a second.
Are we talking about the same person?

29:03.867 --> 29:05.410
Hey, you better get
your eyes checked, Jack.

29:05.493 --> 29:09.581
Ain't nothing wrong with my eyes, son.
I know the woman when I see the woman.

29:09.664 --> 29:11.166
Like hell you do, man.

29:13.042 --> 29:15.253
All right. So she wasn't there.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.506
Ain't no skin off my nose, babe.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.887
Hey, you want to hear
something really funny?

29:26.222 --> 29:27.515
Guess you don't.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.947
<i>-</i>WOMAN (on phone):<i> Hello?</i>
-Hello, Miss Thomas?

29:43.031 --> 29:44.199
<i>-Neal?</i>
-Let me speak with Jill.

29:44.282 --> 29:47.035
<i>-She's in Los Angeles.</i>
-Look, Miss Thomas, I know she's in town.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.870
-I know let me-- Now where is she?
<i>-I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

29:49.454 --> 29:53.208
It weren't no kind of case to begin with,
$20 bail, you know?

29:53.750 --> 29:56.753
And I had to keep going back to court
so many times.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.838
Seven, nine times, I lost my job.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.049
Finally, I got a job here and...

30:01.800 --> 30:04.552
Well, you know,
I had the kids and all. I had to leave.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.305
And them lawyers for the white boys kept
saying to the judge,

30:07.388 --> 30:11.100
"We're waiting for Mr. Green," by which
they mean their money, see? Mr. Green.

30:11.309 --> 30:14.354
And so that kept the case being postponed
so many times,

30:14.437 --> 30:16.064
and, well, that's what happened.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.024
That was, what, about five years ago?

30:18.107 --> 30:21.444
Yeah. Seems if they wanted me so much,
they'd come and got me by now.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.321
They probably don't want you much,
Mr. Teacher,

30:23.404 --> 30:25.448
but you're facing a bail jump now.

30:25.532 --> 30:29.661
I know. I know. That's why I say if you
send me back, I'll lose my job again.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.747
Mr. Teacher, I tell you what,
I'm gonna go talk to my superior,

30:32.831 --> 30:34.332
see if there's something I can do for you.

30:34.415 --> 30:36.793
I'd... I'd really appreciate that,
Officer.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.128
I'm gonna get this guy off right now.

30:46.511 --> 30:49.097
Ray, try not to schedule
anything past 6:15.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.224
-I want to try and get out of here.
-You should, Frank.

30:51.307 --> 30:52.600
I'm gonna take care
of this whole thing myself.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.143
-Hi, Andy.
-Lieutenant Call... Call... Calletano.

30:54.227 --> 30:57.438
-Hello, Bobby.
-Well, Captain, uh, yes.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.859
We'd like to talk to you about something.
Now, there's a guy--

31:00.942 --> 31:02.694
-William Teacher?
-William, yes.

31:02.777 --> 31:03.987
Would you like to sit down?

31:05.446 --> 31:06.823
-I'll stand.
-Sure.

31:08.950 --> 31:09.826
-He helped you out.
-Yes.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.287
-He also helped out LaRue and Washington.
-Yes.

31:12.370 --> 31:15.498
He's also wanted in Kansas City
for assault and jumping bail.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.251
Yes. Well, see,
he didn't just help us out.

31:18.334 --> 31:22.088
He stopped me from getting a pipe
smashed across my cranium.

31:22.171 --> 31:25.758
And, Captain,
even allowing for 50 percent horse manure,

31:25.842 --> 31:28.219
which in this particular case
I don't think there's too much of it,

31:28.303 --> 31:32.891
the guy seems like he's a hell of a person
who's just been dealt a terrible hand.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.851
That's interesting.
LaRue says the same thing.

31:34.934 --> 31:36.603
What would you have me do, gentlemen?

31:36.686 --> 31:40.106
Well, why don't you just--
We'll just open up the jail cell door

31:40.189 --> 31:41.274
and let him take a walk out.

31:41.357 --> 31:44.569
I mean, what about this, uh,
discretion we hear about all the time?

31:44.652 --> 31:47.697
From where I stand, the exercise
of our discretion does not extend

31:47.780 --> 31:50.491
to giving individuals who happen
to be nice to police officers

31:50.575 --> 31:53.286
special attention in direct violation
of the law.

31:53.369 --> 31:56.956
But, Captain, what about all the stuff
that we let the snitches get away with?

31:57.040 --> 32:00.251
When we deal with snitches, it's because
we expect something in return.

32:00.543 --> 32:03.254
Usually, in theory anyway,
we catch a bigger fish.

32:03.338 --> 32:07.008
And I guess that something in return is
not equal to my skull, which, by the way,

32:07.091 --> 32:09.636
from the amount I'm paid,
I could have guessed that, I could have.

32:10.261 --> 32:13.222
I'm sorry, gentlemen. It's by the book.
We catch 'em, we don't cook 'em.

32:13.932 --> 32:17.226
Uh, by the way, if you can scare up Bates
and Coffey for me,

32:17.310 --> 32:19.520
I'd like to talk to all four of you
a little later about something.

32:20.855 --> 32:22.148
About what, Captain?

32:22.231 --> 32:24.692
Later, in the Interrogation Room,
we'll talk.

32:24.776 --> 32:25.902
Come on. Come on.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.613
You think you could, um...

32:40.875 --> 32:42.377
-Hi.
-Hey, how you doing, Sheila?

32:42.460 --> 32:44.337
Look, I got to talk to you about Jill.

32:47.507 --> 32:48.925
(sighs)

32:50.051 --> 32:51.970
Nothing's wrong, is there?

32:52.053 --> 32:54.013
I mean, the girl doesn't call me at all.

32:54.097 --> 32:57.600
Hey, look, forget it, Sheila.
I spoke with Bobby Hill.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.560
He saw you guys last night.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.689
What are you saying?
Jill is in Los Angeles.

33:02.772 --> 33:04.816
-Mm-mm.
-Spoke with her mama.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.443
-She's not there, so she's got to be here.
-Neal.

33:10.613 --> 33:11.990
(sighs)

33:13.574 --> 33:14.617
Sorry, Sheila.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.955
Well, I guess I better go put the wash
in the dryer.

33:30.049 --> 33:32.260
-(door closes)
-Los Angeles?

33:33.136 --> 33:35.471
-Look, Neal--
-Look what?

33:35.555 --> 33:37.140
What were you trying to pull anyway, huh?

33:37.974 --> 33:40.977
-Well, I didn't go to Los Angeles.
-I can see that.

33:41.310 --> 33:44.313
I could have. I really could have,
you know. The chance is there.

33:45.648 --> 33:47.025
So instead, you hide.

33:47.859 --> 33:48.818
You lie.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.030
Would you have been happier if I'd gone?

33:57.702 --> 33:59.579
I just don't understand
what you're trying to do, Jill.

34:01.539 --> 34:02.373
Well...

34:04.167 --> 34:06.586
I guess I just figured
that you ought to have a sense

34:06.669 --> 34:09.213
of what your life
would be like without me.

34:10.131 --> 34:13.426
-It's about time, wouldn't you say?
-Time for what?

34:13.509 --> 34:16.262
Time for you to know, Neal,
or at least think about it.

34:17.055 --> 34:20.308
Have you been having a good time the last
couple of weeks? How's your life been?

34:22.685 --> 34:26.189
Neal, can you live without me?

34:28.024 --> 34:30.318
That's a funny way to ask those questions.

34:30.401 --> 34:32.904
Look, Neal, I am doing the best I can.

34:33.446 --> 34:36.741
Now do I love you less
for not going out there or more?

34:37.950 --> 34:39.660
Now that's a funny way to show it.

34:40.703 --> 34:43.873
I mean, you shamed me. You embarrassed me.

34:44.540 --> 34:47.835
And that sure as hell is not my idea
of helping a relationship.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.174
<i>-</i>COMPUTER:<i> Have a nice day.</i>
-Thank you very much.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.176
It's very kind and thoughtful of you.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.220
Say, man, you got a quarter?

34:57.595 --> 34:59.639
Hey, look here, brother,
you know which way Jefferson Avenue is?

34:59.722 --> 35:01.474
I sort of lost my way around here.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.773
(growling)

35:09.607 --> 35:10.942
(tires squealing)

35:25.540 --> 35:27.750
Joe, did you see the guy
on the back of the van?

35:29.293 --> 35:30.378
Didn't you ever do that
when you were a kid?

35:30.461 --> 35:31.921
It was a rabbi.

35:33.214 --> 35:34.507
A rabbi?

35:39.137 --> 35:42.765
(siren blaring)

35:53.234 --> 35:56.070
Open up, dog breath! Police!

36:07.707 --> 36:11.043
Slow it down, armpit, you're speeding!

36:11.127 --> 36:14.130
-(tires screeching)
-(siren blaring)

36:51.918 --> 36:55.087
-Freeze!
-(growling)

36:58.341 --> 37:02.845
I'm here to assist you
with all your banking needs, hairball!

37:05.640 --> 37:06.807
Spread 'em!

37:08.309 --> 37:10.186
(chattering)

37:11.479 --> 37:13.022
Move it, dog breath.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.859
Left turn. Left. Left!

37:18.152 --> 37:21.364
Bates, Coffey, Captain wants to see you
both in Interrogation right away.

37:21.447 --> 37:23.616
Go on. I'll take over. Come on.

37:25.785 --> 37:28.704
-I read your reports.
-We got a problem here?

37:29.705 --> 37:30.915
Maybe you should answer that.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.542
Don't know what you mean, Captain.

37:34.794 --> 37:38.089
Gentlemen, Lucy,
I've been reading reports for 17 years.

37:38.172 --> 37:40.299
I think I know the smell of a tuna by now.

37:41.467 --> 37:42.385
(chuckles)

37:42.969 --> 37:44.262
Now let's just wait here a minute,
Captain.

37:44.345 --> 37:47.682
You see, this guy that Nash was involved
with, he could have done anything.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.475
He's the scum of the Earth.

37:49.558 --> 37:52.561
Is it plausible, I ask myself,
that you, Andy,

37:53.145 --> 37:57.817
saw Esteban resisting arrest
in precisely the same manner

37:57.900 --> 37:59.277
that Bobby saw him resist arrest,

37:59.360 --> 38:02.905
even though, calculating what you did
with the other suspects down the hall,

38:02.989 --> 38:06.534
you had to be at least ten seconds
behind Bobby arriving on the scene?

38:07.201 --> 38:10.746
Is it plausible that you two saw
absolutely nothing

38:11.289 --> 38:14.417
when you had to be arriving there
just seconds behind Renko?

38:15.668 --> 38:17.670
And is it plausible, Bobby,

38:18.004 --> 38:21.299
that you saw Jerry swing his baton
only once,

38:21.382 --> 38:24.176
when by your own admission
you were just steps behind him?

38:24.260 --> 38:26.721
And Esteban sustained four broken ribs,

38:27.013 --> 38:30.891
facial lacerations requiring 38 stitches
and a severe concussion?

38:30.975 --> 38:32.018
Come on!

38:36.230 --> 38:40.318
People, if you don't fool me, you're sure
as hell not gonna fool Internal Affairs.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.029
They deal with this kind of thing
every day.

38:45.448 --> 38:48.951
I've known Jerry Nash longer than
any of you, and I have to tell you this.

38:51.287 --> 38:54.790
If I were in your place, I wouldn't do
what you're doing in these reports.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.716
Well, Captain,
I think I might be way out of line,

39:03.799 --> 39:05.676
but I got a real problem with this.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.763
I mean,
it seems like it's been going on all day.

39:08.846 --> 39:12.308
First with this Teacher stuff and all, and
now what you're saying about Jerry Nash.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.353
First thing that happens,
we get ourselves a new friend,

39:15.436 --> 39:18.022
or somebody we owe a debt of gratitude to,
and that guy gets the shaft.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.899
You know what I'm talking about, Captain?

39:19.982 --> 39:22.985
I'm talking about a little individual
loyalty here.

39:23.069 --> 39:26.238
I don't need lessons in loyalty from you,
Renko. I have my loyalties.

39:26.572 --> 39:28.657
They're to this department
and to all of you.

39:29.367 --> 39:32.912
But I won't be able to protect you
should these reports turn out to be...

39:34.663 --> 39:35.581
dubious.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.918
So why don't you just talk it over
among yourselves.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.586
And if you decide to make
some adjustments,

39:40.669 --> 39:42.505
have them on my desk within the hour.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.101
Where's he been?

39:59.814 --> 40:02.608
I'm sorry, Bobby.
I'm not gonna go through with it.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.071
-I can't either, Bobby.
-So what happens to Jerry Nash?

40:07.154 --> 40:09.115
You can kiss his career goodbye,
can't you?

40:09.198 --> 40:11.909
Come on, Renko. So he gets a few
black marks. What's the big deal?

40:11.992 --> 40:14.412
The big deal is he's already got
a few black marks

40:14.495 --> 40:15.913
against him down at Jefferson Heights.

40:15.996 --> 40:17.665
-That's the big deal!
-So he's dirty.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.250
So maybe he gets what he deserves.

40:19.333 --> 40:20.209
You know what?

40:20.292 --> 40:22.420
What you're saying is you're willing
to throw a guy off a building

40:22.503 --> 40:25.256
'cause he spent about two or three months
having a hard time at home

40:25.339 --> 40:28.509
and now finds some circumstances
where anyone in their right mind

40:28.592 --> 40:31.387
would want to protect their own skull
against the kind of person that--

40:31.470 --> 40:32.972
What about the victim's skull?

40:33.055 --> 40:34.432
Why don't you just knock it off,
all of you?

40:34.515 --> 40:35.766
I mean, listen to us.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.689
Cowboy, I'm the one who got us into this--

40:41.772 --> 40:43.441
-Now you don't have to start that.
-No, not you, me.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.484
I appreciate what you're saying.
I know you're saying it for me,

40:45.568 --> 40:48.946
and I thank you for helping me out
when I needed you.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.990
But it's not gonna work.

40:51.824 --> 40:55.244
I am not gonna let you two
get hung out to dry

40:55.578 --> 40:56.704
on account of me.

40:57.413 --> 41:00.833
So I'm gonna change my report,
and I'm just sorry that I got you into it.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.544
We wouldn't have done it
in the first place, Bobby,

41:03.627 --> 41:04.795
if we didn't want to.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.255
I know. I know.

41:07.089 --> 41:09.758
Bobby, you aren't perfect.
At least you tried.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.178
We're all trying, cowboy.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.140
Well, anyway, I'm sorry.

41:17.933 --> 41:20.644
You know what you saw.
Just write the truth.

41:28.569 --> 41:29.904
(door closes)

42:00.392 --> 42:02.353
Neal, can we talk?

42:05.523 --> 42:06.440
You back for good?

42:09.401 --> 42:10.736
No more lies.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.155
Hey.

42:16.408 --> 42:18.619
BELKER: What do you mean
you don't have anything to wear, Ma?

42:18.702 --> 42:21.580
You're not going to a débutante's ball,
you're going on a cruise.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.791
(woman indistinct)

42:23.874 --> 42:26.919
I know that. Luana will take you shopping,
buy you a nice bikini.

42:27.002 --> 42:29.588
MOM:<i> A bikini? What am I, Brigitte Bardot?</i>

42:29.672 --> 42:31.090
What's wrong with a bikini, Ma?

42:31.173 --> 42:32.591
<i>I don't want to wear a bikini.</i>

42:32.675 --> 42:36.178
Oh, Ma, please. Come on.
You got a great little shape.

42:36.262 --> 42:39.056
<i>I haven't had a great little shape</i>
<i>since I was young.</i>

42:42.351 --> 42:44.728
The city walked away
from the table half hour ago.

42:44.812 --> 42:46.814
I heard. It's gonna be a rough one, Phil.

42:46.897 --> 42:48.857
The city doesn't have any money,
we don't have any money.

42:49.858 --> 42:51.902
Oh, Francis, uh,
a couple of other matters.

42:51.986 --> 42:55.114
On the subject
of those discretionary arrests,

42:55.197 --> 42:57.866
the ones alleged to be wind chill related?

42:57.950 --> 43:00.411
-Mm-hmm?
-I spoke to the night officer.

43:00.619 --> 43:03.414
There will be no more busts
for littering or loitering,

43:04.248 --> 43:08.043
though he can promise nothing
of the more serious matter of, uh,

43:08.460 --> 43:10.129
public urination.

43:11.213 --> 43:13.340
I understand the night officer's concern.

43:14.592 --> 43:18.095
Oh, also, uh, the night pouch.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.683
Hill and the others are reconsidering
their reports right now.

43:23.517 --> 43:26.854
-What are they gonna say?
-The truth, I presume.

43:27.313 --> 43:30.107
-By the book.
-You talk to Nash?

43:33.944 --> 43:34.903
In the morning.

43:36.030 --> 43:39.033
I'm sorry, Francis.
I know you go way back with the guy.

43:40.534 --> 43:43.829
Uh, what a day. What a day.

43:43.912 --> 43:46.915
Oh, Phil, I almost forgot.

43:47.791 --> 43:51.003
Regarding the extradition
of alleged fugitive, William Teacher.

43:51.462 --> 43:54.548
Next time you see Renko, tell him
we never heard of William Teacher.

43:57.593 --> 43:59.803
That my certificate of valor
you're ripping up?

44:00.763 --> 44:02.139
Francis, Jerry.

44:07.686 --> 44:11.940
Frank, I don't know what you know
or maybe what you figured about yesterday.

44:12.024 --> 44:15.569
I went out on a limb for you, Jerry,
and you sawed it off behind me.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.112
Well, if that's the way you want
to look at it.

44:17.196 --> 44:18.530
That's the way it is.

44:20.324 --> 44:21.742
I'm gonna resign, Frank.

44:23.202 --> 44:24.620
I just wanted you to know.

44:24.953 --> 44:26.372
I think that's wise.

44:28.290 --> 44:32.127
I get my accounting degree in four months
if I go to school full-time.

44:33.504 --> 44:36.465
So I'm sending the kids back east
to be with their grandmother.

44:37.299 --> 44:39.343
I hope things work out for you, Jer.

44:40.594 --> 44:41.470
Yeah?

44:43.055 --> 44:44.431
Yeah, I know you do.

44:47.518 --> 44:48.394
Well...

44:50.187 --> 44:51.105
I'll see you, Frank.

45:00.781 --> 45:02.658
FURILLO: Phil, could you--

45:04.076 --> 45:06.412
Oh, Joyce, give me a minute,
would you, please?

45:06.495 --> 45:07.663
Why don't you have a cup of coffee.

45:09.707 --> 45:12.126
Would you get me Ron Linker
in Internal Affairs, please?

45:15.963 --> 45:17.881
(dialing)

46:16.940 --> 46:18.150
Mrs. Furillo?

46:18.984 --> 46:19.985
Yes?

46:20.903 --> 46:24.865
We were never formally introduced.
My name's Joyce Davenport.

46:25.741 --> 46:29.495
Oh, yes.
My husband's mentioned you, of course.

46:38.837 --> 46:40.506
I heard about your loss.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.635
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

46:47.429 --> 46:49.598
You know, when Frank and I were married...

46:51.308 --> 46:53.310
the thing I feared most in life

46:54.436 --> 46:56.605
was the phone call
in the middle of the night.

46:58.148 --> 47:02.069
Or in the afternoon,
two cops coming to the door

47:03.153 --> 47:05.155
to tell me that my husband
had been killed.

47:07.491 --> 47:10.953
And, uh, it never went away.

47:12.663 --> 47:18.043
During that whole time,
never had any real peace or security.

47:20.170 --> 47:21.922
And then, when we were divorced,

47:23.382 --> 47:28.262
I thought, well, at least I don't have
to worry about that anymore.

47:31.139 --> 47:32.432
And then with Hal,

47:34.309 --> 47:36.061
I thought I was gonna have it all.

47:41.400 --> 47:42.484
Oh, God.

47:43.193 --> 47:46.864
I feel so frightened and alone.

47:47.906 --> 47:51.785
(sobbing)

47:53.787 --> 47:56.623
(sobbing continues)

47:58.083 --> 47:59.001
(sniffles)

48:34.536 --> 48:37.539
(closing theme playing)
