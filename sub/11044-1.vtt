00:40.375 --> 00:44.209
All too often

00:44.278 --> 00:47.805
I set my life aside

00:49.317 --> 00:52.445
All too often

00:52.520 --> 00:56.854
My dreams went sailing by

00:58.393 --> 01:01.123
A chance of freedom

01:02.230 --> 01:05.221
A chance of faith

01:06.768 --> 01:10.295
A chance I'll take

01:10.371 --> 01:19.075
Knowing it all will disappear

01:19.147 --> 01:24.483
It ain't anywhere but here

01:27.455 --> 01:31.221
All too often

01:31.292 --> 01:34.750
The dreams I dreamed have died

01:36.330 --> 01:39.595
All too often...

01:39.667 --> 01:42.830
My mother made
an amazing amount of noise

01:42.904 --> 01:44.838
when she ate her food.

01:44.906 --> 01:49.240
It was as if she was trying to
taste the entire world.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.177
Sometimes I just couldn't stand her.

01:53.848 --> 01:55.577
Sometimes I hated her.

01:56.951 --> 02:00.182
Sometimes I thought
she was ruining my life.

02:00.254 --> 02:04.350
What kept me going was knowing
that one day I would leave her.

02:05.726 --> 02:11.221
I'll find it anywhere but here

02:17.371 --> 02:20.169
Come on, baby, surfin' safari

02:20.241 --> 02:29.340
Yeah, I'm gonna take you
surfin' safari

02:29.417 --> 02:30.941
Let's go surfin' now

02:31.018 --> 02:32.508
Everybody's learnin' how

02:32.587 --> 02:34.350
Come on a safari with me

02:34.422 --> 02:35.354
Ba la la la la la la

02:36.657 --> 02:37.851
I hate this song.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.586
I love this song.
It's the Beach Boys.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.389
I hate the Beach Boys.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.724
Honey, how can you
hate the Beach Boys?

02:42.797 --> 02:43.729
Nobody hates the Beach Boys.

02:43.798 --> 02:45.095
They're too happy and sunny.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.498
Well, you're gonna have to learn
to like happy and sunny,

02:47.568 --> 02:50.230
because that's what
California's all about.

02:51.939 --> 02:55.466
Oh, next stop, Salt Lake City. Yes!

02:55.543 --> 02:58.239
Salt Lake City, Utah.
The capital, right?

02:58.312 --> 02:59.301
I don't care.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.506
Oh, yes, you do care.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.980
Come on, don't mumble.
You care.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.880
You're very good at capitals.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.976
Idaho.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.987
Come on, Pooh Bear, Idaho.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.079
Stop calling me Pooh Bear.

03:09.157 --> 03:11.557
But you are my little Pooh Bear.
Come on.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.719
Come on. Idaho.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.762
Boise!
I don't want to play.

03:15.830 --> 03:16.854
Ok, now you do one for me.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.330
A really hard one.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.765
I said I don't want to play.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.335
Oregon.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.735
Portland. Too easy.

03:24.805 --> 03:25.737
Salem.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.171
It's Salem?

03:27.241 --> 03:29.175
I don't want to do this anymore.

03:29.243 --> 03:32.076
I don't want to be in Utah.

03:32.146 --> 03:37.413
2,000 miles between us and Bay City. Ok.

03:37.485 --> 03:39.544
I want to be back in Bay City.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.746
This is like being kidnapped.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.049
You don't understand that, do you?

03:42.123 --> 03:43.647
I wish somebody had kidnapped me

03:43.724 --> 03:44.918
when I was your age.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.254
So do I.

04:01.676 --> 04:05.009
Grandma always said
that my mom was a strange child.

04:11.719 --> 04:14.950
Oh, this is absolutely moribound.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.579
Gwen Purvis has cancer.

04:16.656 --> 04:17.988
That's worse.

04:18.059 --> 04:19.185
I didn't give it to her.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.359
You didn't give it to her.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.398
That's funny, Aunt Adele.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.659
You're gonna die
one day, too, Mom,

04:25.733 --> 04:26.825
just like the rest of us.

04:26.901 --> 04:29.461
But not in this town.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.438
My mother never
wanted to stay in Bay City.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.941
I think she married my stepfather Ted

04:36.010 --> 04:40.003
because he was so nice
and so clean.

04:40.081 --> 04:42.413
Being an ice skating instructor
made him seem cleaner.

04:42.483 --> 04:46.317
She missed my real father,
who was Egyptian,

04:46.387 --> 04:48.252
dark, and romantic.

04:53.294 --> 04:57.230
One Christmas Eve
I heard my parents arguing.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.135
I didn't know anything
until he was gone.

05:08.376 --> 05:11.607
He drove away in our brown Valiant.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.177
I'm sorry.

05:17.251 --> 05:19.242
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.810
I'm so sorry.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.458
You're awfully quiet.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.598
You said we'd see
an Indian reservation.

05:39.674 --> 05:41.403
When we get to one,
we will see one.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.500
Sweetie, don't mumble.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.011
How are you gonna be an actress
if you can't speak clearly?

05:46.080 --> 05:48.674
I don't want to be an actress.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.309
I bet we won't even stop
in Las Vegas, will we?

05:51.385 --> 05:53.444
Ah, now, that's what's bothering you.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.783
You said you had a number on him.

05:54.855 --> 05:58.154
I said we would look him up, ok?

05:58.225 --> 05:59.453
When you were 4 years old,

05:59.527 --> 06:02.257
your father left you just
in the middle of the night.

06:02.330 --> 06:04.093
So, what?
You left my stepfather

06:04.165 --> 06:06.725
in the middle of the afternoon.

06:06.801 --> 06:07.733
I miss Ted.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.030
Nobody misses Ted.
He's boring.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.195
Then why'd you marry him?

06:10.271 --> 06:13.866
That's none of your business.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.501
Besides, he was running
around with other women.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.704
That's not true.
You made that up.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.644
You wanted him to,
so you could catch him

06:20.715 --> 06:22.273
and take him to court
and get all his money.

06:22.350 --> 06:24.875
You little snoop.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.249
And Ted is not a homosexual.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.617
I never said that.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.620
Yes, you did.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.553
Oh, no, I did not.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.612
Oh, yes, you did.

06:30.691 --> 06:31.749
Maybe I inferred it,
but I never said it.

06:31.826 --> 06:32.815
"Light in the loafers"

06:32.893 --> 06:35.327
is not exactly the same thing.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.863
All right, Mother.

06:36.931 --> 06:39.297
Ted said he loves you,

06:39.367 --> 06:41.232
and that he was worried that
you were seeing other people,

06:41.302 --> 06:42.860
which you probably were.

06:42.937 --> 06:45.132
All right, that is it.
I have had it with you.

06:45.206 --> 06:47.106
If you miss Ted so much,
you go find Ted.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.904
Go on, get out ofthe car.
Out! O-u-t, out!

06:49.977 --> 06:51.410
You said we'd see
buffalo in Nebraska.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.946
There were no buffalo.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.002
Tough shit!
Get out of the car!

08:17.264 --> 08:20.028
Ted is going to be
an ice skating instructor

08:20.100 --> 08:21.260
for the rest of his life.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.769
Your cousin Benny is going
to be a garage mechanic.

08:23.838 --> 08:25.533
Lolly is never
going to leave the bank.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.836
Your cousin Hal's
already drinking liquor.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.876
And Sylvia and the baby
can barely breathe.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.309
They're gonna suffocate back there,

08:31.378 --> 08:33.778
but I now have a job teaching

08:33.847 --> 08:35.941
in the Los Angeles school system.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.916
I have an M.A. in early education

08:37.985 --> 08:39.316
which I have just thrown away

08:39.385 --> 08:41.013
in that dink junior high school
back there,

08:41.087 --> 08:42.749
so you forget about the buffalo

08:42.823 --> 08:44.518
and the goddamn Indians.

08:44.592 --> 08:47.755
You are a beautiful girl
with great potential.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.693
I'm not gonna see your future
as some nothing girl

08:49.763 --> 08:51.492
in a nothing factory
in a nothing town.

08:51.565 --> 08:54.159
You are 14 years old,

08:54.235 --> 08:56.169
you've always had enough to eat,

08:56.237 --> 08:57.864
you've always had
a roof over your head,

08:57.938 --> 08:59.599
and if you stick with me,
you always will,

08:59.673 --> 09:01.538
because I am your mother,

09:01.609 --> 09:03.440
and I know what is best for you

09:03.511 --> 09:05.672
because that is my job.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.738
Plus you're gonna go
to school in Beverly Hills,

09:08.816 --> 09:09.942
which is only
the best school district

09:10.017 --> 09:11.484
in the United States.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.019
And you'll be a child actor

09:13.087 --> 09:14.179
while you're still a child.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.917
You don't have a job
in the Los Angeles school district.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.325
I will have.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.590
I have an interview
and a great outfit.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.188
Are you hungry?

09:25.266 --> 09:27.234
Excuse me.

09:27.301 --> 09:29.269
I don't know.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.531
Great. So am I.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.766
So...

09:33.841 --> 09:36.071
Will you look at that car?

09:36.143 --> 09:38.771
Is that the most
beautiful automobile

09:38.846 --> 09:40.211
you've ever seen?

09:40.281 --> 09:44.183
No. I hate that car.
I miss the Plymouth.

09:45.419 --> 09:49.446
Baby, nobody misses the Plymouth.

09:51.225 --> 09:52.453
It's your color.

09:52.526 --> 09:54.994
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

09:55.062 --> 09:57.428
Oh, look at this.

09:57.498 --> 10:00.058
It's so beautiful.

10:00.134 --> 10:01.999
How does it feel?

10:02.069 --> 10:03.934
Sublime.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.835
Mom, we can't afford this car.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.203
We have some money in savings,

10:07.274 --> 10:10.766
and I can dip into
the teachers' retirement fund.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.308
This car does not belong in Bay City,

10:13.380 --> 10:14.938
and neither do we.

10:16.083 --> 10:20.611
We're going to drive
to Beverly Hills

10:20.688 --> 10:22.451
in this car.

11:07.201 --> 11:10.364
Mom, this place
looks expensive.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.166
I'll worry about that, ok?

11:12.239 --> 11:13.866
Now that we're in Beverly Hills,

11:13.941 --> 11:16.739
maybe you should change
your name to Heather.

11:20.114 --> 11:22.241
Mmm, it smells so nice here.

11:22.316 --> 11:23.248
How much is the room?

11:23.317 --> 11:24.511
It's 1,200.

11:24.585 --> 11:25.643
A night?

11:25.719 --> 11:26.811
Yes.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.447
I don't know
that it's large enough.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.150
Do you have any villas?

11:31.225 --> 11:33.693
There are no villas
available right now.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.160
Mom, I'm tired.

11:35.229 --> 11:37.493
Where are we gonna sleep tonight?

11:46.040 --> 11:47.473
Sweet pea,

11:47.541 --> 11:51.534
you are just as pretty
as these girls on TV.

11:51.612 --> 11:54.012
In fact, I think you're prettier.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.917
Sweetie, are you all right?

12:00.988 --> 12:04.788
'Cause you've been in there
for over an hour.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.421
Ok, well...

12:08.495 --> 12:10.156
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.993
And I think mayb eyou should soon,

12:12.066 --> 12:15.433
because you need
your beauty rest, ok?

12:15.502 --> 12:17.561
Ok. Good night.

12:23.744 --> 12:27.475
I miss everyone
in Bay City so much.

12:27.548 --> 12:29.641
I don't know how
I'm going to survive

12:29.717 --> 12:31.582
without my cousin Benny.

12:33.454 --> 12:35.445
And my best friend,

12:35.522 --> 12:36.989
good little Mary.

12:37.057 --> 12:41.255
Serious Mary, Benny, and I.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.626
We were inseparable.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.062
Benny!

12:45.132 --> 12:46.429
I made this for you.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.229
Say good-bye to your cousin!

12:48.302 --> 12:53.934
It's tin and painted on one side
with gold dust.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.235
Not real gold dust.

12:55.309 --> 12:56.767
Ann!

12:56.901 --> 12:58.493
We're ready to go!

13:01.438 --> 13:04.271
Where do you want
the cookies and the sandwiches?

13:04.341 --> 13:06.241
Oh, Mom, thanks.
I'll take them.

13:06.310 --> 13:09.871
You didn't give her all the cookies,
did you, Lillian?

13:09.947 --> 13:12.177
Don't forget to call us
from the road.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.443
You're gonna come visit.

13:13.517 --> 13:15.576
I'm gonna find an apartment
that's got 3 bedrooms.

13:15.653 --> 13:17.211
She doesn't even have
a place to live.

13:17.288 --> 13:18.915
Stop worrying about it, Mom.

13:18.989 --> 13:20.786
If you knew for sure
there was a job out there...

13:20.858 --> 13:21.790
She's got the school job.

13:21.859 --> 13:23.759
Oh, she has no such thing.

13:23.828 --> 13:25.659
She talked to somebody
on the telephone.

13:25.729 --> 13:28.254
When are you gonna start
having some faith in me?

13:28.332 --> 13:29.731
When you begin
to see things as they are.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.893
Don't take any wooden nickels, Adele.

13:31.969 --> 13:33.903
Right, Jimmy.

13:33.971 --> 13:35.836
Ok, thanks.

13:38.008 --> 13:39.839
Sorry, Ted.

13:42.012 --> 13:42.979
I'll write.

13:45.015 --> 13:50.214
Ann, come on!
I'm gonna leave without you!

13:50.287 --> 13:51.618
Benny!

13:52.690 --> 13:53.884
Ben!

14:02.766 --> 14:04.631
I hope you destroyed those pictures

14:04.702 --> 14:06.169
you took of me in my underwear.

14:06.237 --> 14:08.865
I did, Mary, I promise.

14:08.939 --> 14:09.906
OK.

14:11.175 --> 14:14.201
Let's go.
We'll call from the road.

14:14.278 --> 14:15.711
I'll miss you, too, Grandma.

14:15.779 --> 14:18.043
Take care of yourself.

14:18.115 --> 14:20.982
Ann, here.
Just in case you find

14:21.051 --> 14:23.383
a skating rink out there.

14:23.454 --> 14:25.388
Thanks, Ted.

14:25.456 --> 14:29.688
I love you. You're the best stepdad
a girl could have.

14:29.760 --> 14:34.595
You'll always be with me

14:34.665 --> 14:37.395
Always be with me

14:37.468 --> 14:40.096
Part of my heart

14:40.170 --> 14:45.164
Once I'm where I'm going

14:45.242 --> 14:48.734
Look away

14:50.414 --> 14:58.219
Even if it's just in my mind

15:01.258 --> 15:02.384
Oh, here's a good one.

15:02.459 --> 15:07.021
"Pool, walk-in closets, security,

15:07.097 --> 15:08.394
vaulted ceilings."

15:08.465 --> 15:11.525
Vaulted. I love it.

15:11.602 --> 15:12.933
Excuse me.

15:13.003 --> 15:16.200
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help but overhearing.

15:16.273 --> 15:18.707
I thought I might help you.

15:18.776 --> 15:20.767
I'm Gail Letterfine.

15:20.844 --> 15:23.335
Westside Realty.

15:23.414 --> 15:25.109
Oh.

15:25.182 --> 15:27.047
So, what are you looking for?

15:27.117 --> 15:29.483
Something in Beverly Hills.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.953
I'm Adele August.
This is my daughter Ann.

15:32.022 --> 15:34.684
Hi.

15:34.758 --> 15:37.886
She's not awake.
We just moved here from Wisconsin.

15:37.962 --> 15:39.520
Wisconsin?

15:39.596 --> 15:41.120
I don't know anyone
from Wisconsin.

15:41.198 --> 15:43.257
I'm awake.

15:43.334 --> 15:45.029
You live in Beverly Hills?

15:45.102 --> 15:48.469
No. I live in Santa Monica.
Formerly from Bel Air.

15:48.539 --> 15:49.733
Formerly Brentwood.

15:49.807 --> 15:52.275
I've had a lot of formerlys
in my life.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.475
I'm fine now.
I'm single, I'm free,

15:57.548 --> 15:58.981
and I love it.

16:00.050 --> 16:02.280
Most of the time. Yeah.

16:02.353 --> 16:03.786
Excuse me.

16:06.991 --> 16:08.788
She wants to be an actress.

16:08.859 --> 16:11.350
Don't they all?

16:16.567 --> 16:17.898
Operator.

16:17.968 --> 16:20.129
Just tell her it's a collect call
from her granddaughter Ann.

16:20.204 --> 16:21.193
Just one moment.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.329
Tell her I'll pay her back.

16:22.406 --> 16:26.069
Look what we have
along Beverly Vista.

16:26.143 --> 16:28.941
Beverly Hills adjacent.

16:29.013 --> 16:32.039
That's not the posh part
of Beverly Hills,

16:32.116 --> 16:34.346
but it is still within
the school district.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.686
Sweet pea, what you doing?
Are you OK?

16:41.759 --> 16:42.783
Mm-hmm.

16:42.860 --> 16:45.795
Gail found something for us.
What a woman.

16:45.863 --> 16:48.263
She is raising 3 teenagers by herself.

16:48.332 --> 16:49.799
Husband ran off
with an accountant,

16:49.867 --> 16:51.027
and she can't get
a dime out of him.

16:51.101 --> 16:54.093
Come with me while I pee.
Come on. Also...

16:54.171 --> 16:56.401
she didn't say so, but...

16:56.473 --> 16:58.270
I think she has a glass eye.

16:58.342 --> 16:59.366
You know...

16:59.443 --> 17:01.343
it makes somebody interesting.

17:01.412 --> 17:03.676
You know what I mean?
Interesting in a mysterious way.

17:03.747 --> 17:06.307
Interesting in a kind of a...

17:15.592 --> 17:17.787
Hey, you want a ride?

17:20.196 --> 17:23.325
Ann, there you are.
Your mom's looking for you.

17:23.400 --> 17:24.833
I saw her.

17:24.902 --> 17:28.804
You know, I think that
we might have found a place.

17:30.340 --> 17:33.036
Honey, I know that it's hard
at first, making changes,

17:33.110 --> 17:35.408
but you have to get used to it.

17:35.479 --> 17:37.743
Life is full of them.

17:37.815 --> 17:39.077
Ann, where did you go?

17:39.149 --> 17:40.946
I was in there talking
and talking to you.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.714
I come out here and you're gone.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.226
Your love

17:56.300 --> 17:58.894
Is better than ice cream

17:58.969 --> 18:04.430
Better than anything else
that I've tried

18:04.508 --> 18:06.703
Your love

18:06.777 --> 18:09.473
Is better than ice cream

18:09.546 --> 18:15.781
But everyone here knows how to cry

18:17.588 --> 18:21.388
It's a long way down

18:22.759 --> 18:31.429
It's a long way down

18:31.502 --> 18:35.598
To the place where we started from

18:37.374 --> 18:39.274
You didn't get the job.

18:41.478 --> 18:44.606
It's in the bag, baby.

18:44.681 --> 18:47.206
Come here, you.

18:47.284 --> 18:48.216
Serious?

18:48.285 --> 18:49.343
Yes!

18:50.821 --> 18:52.379
I hate my hair.

18:52.456 --> 18:53.980
It's one of your strongest assets.

18:54.057 --> 18:55.217
I'm gonna cut it off.

18:55.292 --> 18:56.520
Over my dead body.

18:56.593 --> 18:57.617
OK.

19:00.697 --> 19:01.629
OK. Let's go.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.660
Can you believe that?

19:12.109 --> 19:13.804
They look like
they're going to the beach.

19:13.877 --> 19:16.209
The intelligent girls are inside.

19:18.715 --> 19:19.943
Bab-

19:21.818 --> 19:23.683
I hate you.

19:23.754 --> 19:27.212
We'll talk about that later, sweetie.
Good luck.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.725
How about good luck for me?

19:29.793 --> 19:31.954
How do I I-look?

19:54.785 --> 19:56.184
Why don't you just back off?

19:56.253 --> 19:57.948
Punk!

19:58.021 --> 20:00.046
Come on, let's go!

20:00.123 --> 20:01.249
Everybody,

20:01.325 --> 20:04.556
this is our new speech pathologist,
Adele August.

20:04.628 --> 20:06.858
Adele is from Bay City, Wisconsin.

20:06.930 --> 20:09.160
America's dairyland.

20:09.233 --> 20:10.165
Ah, Wisconsin.

20:10.234 --> 20:11.166
Yes.

20:11.235 --> 20:12.327
George Franklin, history.

20:12.402 --> 20:13.369
George. History.

20:14.938 --> 20:16.929
Room 12 is to the right, right?

20:17.007 --> 20:17.996
Let me show you.

20:18.075 --> 20:19.007
Follow me.

20:19.076 --> 20:20.543
Thank you so much.

20:24.915 --> 20:26.576
Not exactly Bay City,

20:26.650 --> 20:28.242
but you get used to it.

20:32.356 --> 20:36.486
Mmm. Is that-
Did they throw out that furniture?

20:36.560 --> 20:38.221
Is that garbage?

20:38.295 --> 20:39.284
Mm-hmm.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.330
Unbelievable.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.131
Honey, don't scratch the car.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.070
On our days off
we would drive to relax.

20:49.139 --> 20:51.835
We drove just anywhere.

20:53.343 --> 20:55.208
My mother was in awe of the homes

20:55.279 --> 20:56.405
and the palm trees

20:56.480 --> 21:00.211
and real movie stars
on public sidewalks.

21:00.284 --> 21:02.252
She was in love.

21:02.319 --> 21:03.809
In love with Beverly Hills.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.013
Oh, I like that one.

21:05.088 --> 21:07.181
Over there, with the circular driveway.

21:07.257 --> 21:09.987
I want the room in the corner.
I can climb out that window.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.527
I'll take the one in the back,

21:11.595 --> 21:13.586
overlooking the pool.

21:17.367 --> 21:19.767
Mmm. That one's a beauty,

21:19.936 --> 21:23.372
with the cute blue shutters.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.908
Oh, look at this house.

21:25.976 --> 21:28.638
This is the house I want.

21:28.712 --> 21:30.373
That is beautiful. Come on.

21:30.447 --> 21:31.846
Mom, it's by appointment only.

21:31.915 --> 21:32.904
It's all right.

21:32.983 --> 21:34.780
It says,
"Do not disturb occupants."

21:34.851 --> 21:38.446
Just smile.
We'll be fine. It's ok.

21:38.522 --> 21:40.615
I appreciate it.
Please think about it.

21:40.691 --> 21:42.090
You're the realtor.

21:42.159 --> 21:43.683
Hi. How can I help you?

21:43.760 --> 21:46.320
Look at this sweet-
Oh, he gave me a kiss.

21:46.396 --> 21:47.363
This is Callie.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.228
Hi, Callie.
And you must be the owner.

21:49.299 --> 21:50.266
My baby. Yes, I am.

21:50.334 --> 21:51.801
Well, I'm Adele August. Hello.

21:51.868 --> 21:53.563
And this is my baby, Heather.

21:53.637 --> 21:54.695
Hi.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.329
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

21:56.406 --> 21:58.306
I know we should
have an appointment,

21:58.375 --> 22:01.503
but my husband will be
practicing medicine at UCLA.

22:01.578 --> 22:02.772
That's just a few minutes
from here.

22:02.846 --> 22:04.780
Exactly, so we were driving by,

22:04.848 --> 22:05.837
and we just had to stop.

22:05.916 --> 22:08.749
I would be so grateful

22:08.819 --> 22:10.616
if you would let us
see the house.

22:10.687 --> 22:11.619
Do you mind?

22:11.688 --> 22:12.712
Not at all.
Please, come in.

22:12.789 --> 22:13.721
Here's my card.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.417
Here's a setup on the property.

22:15.492 --> 22:17.357
Thank you.

22:17.427 --> 22:19.691
The house was built originally
in the 1920s,

22:19.763 --> 22:22.425
so it maintains
all its original integrity.

22:22.499 --> 22:24.399
You also have
a wood-burning fire place here.

22:24.468 --> 22:27.335
There are 7 in the entire house.

22:27.404 --> 22:30.134
There is so much light.
Look at this light.

22:30.207 --> 22:32.573
It's a very happy, happy house.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.803
- So happy, isn't it, Heather?
- Happy.

22:34.878 --> 22:37.438
And here we have
a beautiful bright bedroom.

22:37.514 --> 22:39.414
And you can see the pool from here.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.213
Oh, it's a lovely master suite,
isn't it?

22:42.285 --> 22:44.810
No. This is my daughter's bedroom.

22:44.888 --> 22:46.617
She's away at college now.

22:46.690 --> 22:47.782
Oh. Where is she going?

22:47.858 --> 22:49.826
Back East. Princeton, actually.

22:49.893 --> 22:53.420
I want to go to college back East.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.987
You must miss her terribly.

22:55.065 --> 22:56.999
But we're so very proud.

22:57.067 --> 23:00.264
Well, Daddy will
be here next week.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.737
I really want him
to see this house.

23:02.806 --> 23:05.434
Let me show you
the master bedroom right now.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.910
It's got a great
his-and-her walk-in closet.

23:08.979 --> 23:12.005
It also has a fantastic
Jacuzzi tub.

23:12.082 --> 23:14.175
I love a Jacuzzi.

23:38.875 --> 23:39.842
Hello.

23:39.910 --> 23:41.343
What's up, pervert?

23:41.411 --> 23:42.378
Who is this?

23:42.446 --> 23:43.743
It's hot stuff.

23:43.814 --> 23:46.476
Ann.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.177
Hey, Benny.

23:48.251 --> 23:49.548
Where are you?

23:49.619 --> 23:53.055
Making a highly illegal phone call
in somebody's bedroom.

23:53.123 --> 23:54.522
What are you doing right now?

23:54.591 --> 23:56.354
Hauser's taking us to the park.

23:56.426 --> 23:58.724
He got that new truck.

23:58.795 --> 23:59.762
Why are you whispering?

23:59.830 --> 24:00.922
Where are you?

24:00.997 --> 24:02.760
How's Grandma?

24:02.833 --> 24:06.269
Fine. What did you mean
you're in someone's bedroom?

24:06.336 --> 24:07.598
I'll tell you
when I write you another letter.

24:07.671 --> 24:08.660
You get my last one?

24:08.738 --> 24:11.434
Yeah, yeah, I got 'em all.

24:11.508 --> 24:13.874
I like the one
where she kicked you out of the car.

24:13.944 --> 24:14.876
She really did that?

24:14.945 --> 24:17.209
She's crazy.
She still is.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.748
I think I might kill her
in her sleep.

24:19.816 --> 24:20.976
Heather.

24:21.051 --> 24:22.018
I have to go.

24:22.085 --> 24:23.211
Heather Ann.

24:24.538 --> 24:26.563
Oh, that was so much fun,
wasn't it?

24:26.640 --> 24:28.403
Why'd you tell that lady
that we'd buy the house?

24:28.475 --> 24:29.533
I said we might buy the house.

24:29.609 --> 24:31.042
That my father's coming,
that he's a doctor.

24:31.111 --> 24:32.043
Cardiologist.

24:32.112 --> 24:33.079
I couldn't believe you.

24:33.146 --> 24:34.340
What were you doing

24:34.414 --> 24:36.939
up in the daughter's room
all that time?

24:37.017 --> 24:38.348
Calling Benny.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.286
What?

24:41.354 --> 24:42.981
Ann!

24:43.056 --> 24:45.490
I had to tell her that your father

24:45.559 --> 24:47.390
the doctor was coming
because a woman like that

24:47.461 --> 24:49.793
who gets all ofher money from
her husband, she's not gonna believe

24:49.863 --> 24:51.524
a woman like me can afford
a house like that.

24:51.598 --> 24:53.361
A woman like you
can't afford a house like that.

24:53.433 --> 24:55.594
You can't even afford
the bathroom to that house.

24:55.669 --> 24:58.194
Be optimistic

24:58.271 --> 24:59.397
Don't you be a grumpy

24:59.473 --> 25:01.407
When the road gets bumpy

25:01.475 --> 25:02.737
Just smile, smile, smile

25:02.809 --> 25:03.798
And be happy

25:07.347 --> 25:08.644
Morning, Adele.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.081
Morning, George.

25:11.151 --> 25:13.449
Grand Coolie Dam.
Ever been there, Adele?

25:13.520 --> 25:15.010
Nope.

25:15.088 --> 25:16.453
Hoover Dam?

25:16.523 --> 25:18.753
No.

25:18.825 --> 25:21.157
I'm not really into dams.

25:22.562 --> 25:23.859
I am gonna get a lawyer

25:23.930 --> 25:25.693
and sue her
for invasion of privacy,

25:25.765 --> 25:28.666
so get your nose
out of my diary, Mother.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.726
That's so cool.
I'd never think of that.

25:30.804 --> 25:31.964
Did she say anything?

25:32.038 --> 25:34.302
She played dumb,
but she never did it again.

25:34.374 --> 25:36.001
I wish my parents
would just leave me alone.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.202
I love being alone.

25:37.277 --> 25:39.177
I can't wait for
the house to be empty.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.679
Hi.

25:40.747 --> 25:42.942
Hey, Peter.

25:43.016 --> 25:45.484
You run good.
Got good form.

25:45.552 --> 25:47.520
Yeah.

25:47.587 --> 25:50.852
There's not a cloud
in the sky today, huh?

25:52.225 --> 25:54.125
Hey, you ever read T.S. Eliot?

25:54.194 --> 25:55.786
What?

25:55.862 --> 25:57.853
Four Quartets,
it's really good.

25:59.633 --> 26:02.431
Why do you run with a book?

26:02.502 --> 26:04.436
I don't know.
Balance, I guess.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.038
Here's the Kariba Dam.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.634
It impounds the Zambezi River,

26:11.711 --> 26:13.906
forms Kariba Lake.

26:13.980 --> 26:15.072
- It's nice.
- Hmm.

26:15.148 --> 26:16.513
I went there.

26:16.583 --> 26:20.144
After college.
I painted a picture of it.

26:20.220 --> 26:21.812
You painted pictures of dams?

26:21.888 --> 26:23.185
Mm-hmm.

26:23.256 --> 26:24.723
That was my dream-
To travel the world

26:24.791 --> 26:26.418
and paint pictures.

26:26.493 --> 26:28.688
Hmm. What happened?

26:28.762 --> 26:31.424
Hmm. I don't know.

26:31.498 --> 26:33.523
One damn thing
led to another damn thing.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.397
Ha ha!

26:35.468 --> 26:37.459
I don't know.

26:37.537 --> 26:39.562
I don't know.
I became a history teacher.

26:41.107 --> 26:43.405
But one of these days, I'll...

26:43.476 --> 26:44.408
One of these days-

26:44.477 --> 26:46.445
Oh, my God.
Get away from my car!

26:47.714 --> 26:48.646
Oh, my God, look what he's doing!

26:48.715 --> 26:49.977
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!

26:50.050 --> 26:51.711
No! Stop it!

26:51.785 --> 26:54.253
Oh, my God.
Look how deep this scratch-

26:54.321 --> 26:55.720
Look what he did to my car.

26:55.789 --> 26:58.622
Mom, it's just a scratch.

26:58.692 --> 27:01.024
Just a scratch?

27:01.094 --> 27:02.391
Do you know how much
it's going to cost

27:02.462 --> 27:04.953
to fix "just a scratch"?

27:05.031 --> 27:06.362
Oh, I can't work
at this school anymore.

27:06.433 --> 27:08.230
I can't talk to you anymore, either!

27:08.301 --> 27:09.233
No sympathy.

27:11.438 --> 27:14.373
The tiles are all cracked...

27:14.441 --> 27:15.874
and chipped.

27:15.942 --> 27:16.966
I'm sinking here,

27:17.043 --> 27:19.068
and I'm the one
that has to keep us afloat.

27:19.145 --> 27:21.739
Every time I think
I'm trying so hard,

27:21.815 --> 27:22.873
it's getting better,

27:22.949 --> 27:24.439
and we're starting to get somewhere,

27:24.517 --> 27:27.111
just, everything falls apart.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.052
Aah! Jesus!

27:29.122 --> 27:32.182
Nothing works in this apartment!

27:32.258 --> 27:33.520
- Mom?
- Aah!

27:33.593 --> 27:37.029
It's just a scratch on the car.

27:41.501 --> 27:43.162
Maybe if you got yourself

27:43.236 --> 27:45.966
a little after-school job,

27:46.039 --> 27:48.633
you'd know what
I'm talking about.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.869
People your age have no idea

27:50.944 --> 27:53.003
how much things cost,
how to manage money.

27:53.079 --> 27:55.013
What is that now?

27:55.081 --> 27:57.481
You didn't pay the bill again,
did you?

27:57.550 --> 28:01.953
I did pay the bill!
I did pay it!

28:04.724 --> 28:06.419
Well, maybe I won't even
pay the bill again.

28:06.493 --> 28:08.222
Maybe we'll just...

28:08.294 --> 28:11.127
Ha!
We could live...

28:11.197 --> 28:12.596
in the dark

28:12.666 --> 28:14.531
like little...

28:14.601 --> 28:17.001
bears in a cave,
huh, Pooh Bear?

28:17.070 --> 28:18.833
Hmm?

28:18.905 --> 28:19.837
Just...

28:25.779 --> 28:28.213
Ok, let's go to Denny's.

28:31.551 --> 28:33.542
Ann?

28:33.620 --> 28:35.781
Ann, where are you?

28:35.855 --> 28:37.789
I'm going to bed.

28:47.467 --> 28:50.903
I really thought I paid that bill.

29:01.581 --> 29:05.017
I really think I did pay it.

29:21.701 --> 29:24.329
So, I love you and
say hi to Benny for me

29:24.404 --> 29:26.634
and Uncle Jimmy
and Aunt Carol and...

29:26.706 --> 29:27.730
OK, I love you.
Lots of kisses.

29:27.807 --> 29:29.035
Bye.

29:29.109 --> 29:30.337
Hi, Mom.

29:30.410 --> 29:32.605
How are y'all doing?

29:32.679 --> 29:34.408
What isn't fair?

29:34.481 --> 29:36.039
Well, I put her on
because what's fair

29:36.116 --> 29:38.084
is for your granddaughter
to have a decent home

29:38.151 --> 29:39.675
to live in,
and we can't do that

29:39.753 --> 29:42.244
unless we have some cash
for a down payment.

29:42.322 --> 29:43.653
What I need from you

29:43.723 --> 29:45.315
is some help.

29:45.391 --> 29:46.483
Well...

29:46.559 --> 29:49.027
sell my land, that's how.

29:49.095 --> 29:51.529
It's the land that Daddy-

29:54.834 --> 29:55.892
She hung up.

29:55.969 --> 29:58.437
Grandma hung up on you?

30:03.143 --> 30:04.075
Yeah.

30:14.120 --> 30:16.418
Let's get dressed up
and go out to dinner.

30:16.489 --> 30:18.047
What?

30:19.159 --> 30:20.456
You love that
little French restaurant.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.859
That's -
That's just what we need.

30:24.464 --> 30:26.056
We need a bed for me.
We need a desk.

30:26.132 --> 30:28.362
We need sheets.
We need towels.

30:28.434 --> 30:30.493
We don't need to go out to eat
to a French restaurant.

30:30.570 --> 30:32.037
Oh, honey.

30:32.105 --> 30:34.335
My daddy always used to say,

30:34.407 --> 30:35.840
"When life gets rough

30:35.909 --> 30:37.740
and you only have a dime
in your pocket,

30:37.811 --> 30:40.644
go get your shoes shined."

30:42.615 --> 30:44.139
Get dressed.

30:46.986 --> 30:48.044
Hmm.

30:50.123 --> 30:51.784
Seems they raised their prices.

30:51.858 --> 30:53.723
I'll tell you what.

30:53.793 --> 30:54.725
Why don't the two of us -

30:54.794 --> 30:56.921
Good afternoon.
Would you like to hear our specials?

30:56.996 --> 30:58.987
I don't think so.
We know what we want.

30:59.065 --> 31:00.157
I'd like to hear the specials.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.165
Thank you.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.792
Ok. We have the veal St. Jacques

31:02.869 --> 31:03.858
and a lovely coq au vin-

31:03.937 --> 31:06.269
I think we'll have
2 small garden salads

31:06.339 --> 31:07.271
and share the veal St. Jacques.

31:07.340 --> 31:08.364
Don't you think, honey?

31:08.441 --> 31:09.965
You know what?
I don't really want to share.

31:10.043 --> 31:11.510
I'm kind of hungry, so...

31:11.578 --> 31:12.909
Why don't you have
the veal St. Jacques,

31:12.979 --> 31:16.278
and I'll have
the duck I'orange, please.

31:16.349 --> 31:17.281
And would you like an appetizer?

31:17.350 --> 31:18.282
- I don't think so.
- Yes.

31:18.351 --> 31:20.546
I'll have the shrimp

31:20.620 --> 31:21.985
in the garlic sauce.

31:22.055 --> 31:23.317
And anything to drink?

31:23.389 --> 31:24.754
Just water.

31:24.824 --> 31:26.382
Bottled. A big bottle,

31:26.459 --> 31:27.517
please. Thanks.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.361
OK.
Thank you.

31:36.336 --> 31:38.065
You know what?
I'm really hungry,

31:38.137 --> 31:40.401
and it's not like
we're at Denny's,

31:40.473 --> 31:42.100
so if someone comes in

31:42.175 --> 31:44.040
and sees me eating duck I'orange,

31:44.110 --> 31:46.943
who knows what effect
it'll have on my life.

31:48.915 --> 31:50.849
Sit up straight.

31:50.917 --> 31:52.384
You're slouching.

31:55.388 --> 31:58.380
I took out an ad
in the newspaper once-

31:58.458 --> 32:00.016
"15-year-old seeks home-

32:01.094 --> 32:04.029
Neat, pretty, good student."

32:04.097 --> 32:05.359
I got 79 replies.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.825
I never opened them.

32:09.903 --> 32:14.363
I was afraid the temptation
would be too great.

32:18.878 --> 32:20.539
Passion.

32:20.613 --> 32:22.774
It was our first Christmas
away from home.

32:22.849 --> 32:24.373
Do you customize scents?

32:24.450 --> 32:25.781
No? Oh, that's a shame.

32:25.852 --> 32:26.784
You should do that.

32:26.853 --> 32:28.150
My mother paid enough of our bills

32:28.221 --> 32:30.655
so that we could buy
presents for everyone.

32:30.723 --> 32:33.248
That's pretty cute.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.987
Lavender.
What do you think?

32:35.061 --> 32:36.426
Uhh.

32:36.496 --> 32:37.428
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.828
We didn't buy too much,

32:38.898 --> 32:39.956
considering I love that store.

32:40.033 --> 32:41.523
I don't know what to get Benny.

32:41.601 --> 32:43.068
What did you get me?

32:43.136 --> 32:44.068
Come on, you got me something.

32:44.137 --> 32:45.069
I didn't get you anything.

32:45.138 --> 32:46.162
Oh, yes, you did.

32:46.239 --> 32:47.263
What'd you get me?

32:47.340 --> 32:48.864
I got you lots.
I'm dying to show it to you.

32:48.942 --> 32:50.068
No. Don't show me.

32:50.243 --> 32:51.642
Ann, hi.

32:51.711 --> 32:53.736
Isn't it obscene,
all this money being spent?

32:53.813 --> 32:54.905
- Yeah.
- Hi.

32:54.981 --> 32:56.846
Hi, I'm Janice Pearlman.
I'm in Ann's homeroom.

32:56.916 --> 32:57.848
I'm Ann's mother.

32:57.917 --> 32:59.544
She's my mother.

32:59.619 --> 33:00.551
Hi.

33:00.620 --> 33:02.281
You-You look alike, you two.

33:02.355 --> 33:03.287
- No.
- Oh, thanks.

33:03.356 --> 33:04.687
No, we don't.
I look like my dad.

33:04.757 --> 33:05.689
Just his chin.

33:05.758 --> 33:07.589
I like your chin.
I do.

33:07.660 --> 33:08.820
Anyway, listen, I got to go,

33:08.895 --> 33:10.453
because my mother's
waiting over there,

33:10.530 --> 33:12.760
but Christmas Day,
we're having a party at the house

33:12.832 --> 33:14.060
from 4:00 to 8:00.

33:14.133 --> 33:15.065
Will you come, both of you?

33:15.134 --> 33:16.294
It's our annual thing.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.996
- I-
- Thanks. That's sweet.

33:18.071 --> 33:19.038
Really?
Well, please.

33:19.105 --> 33:21.369
I'll tell you more at school.
Everybody's going to come, though.

33:21.441 --> 33:23.534
- See you later.
- Bye.

33:24.610 --> 33:25.542
Hi.

33:25.611 --> 33:27.272
Everybody likes her.

33:27.347 --> 33:28.439
She's on student council,

33:28.514 --> 33:29.981
and her brother's the editor

33:30.049 --> 33:31.311
of the school newspaper.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.113
What does her father do?

33:33.186 --> 33:34.619
I think he's a doctor.

33:34.687 --> 33:38.054
Huh. Well, it might be fun.

33:38.124 --> 33:39.751
You want to go?

33:39.826 --> 33:41.418
Do you want me to go?

33:41.494 --> 33:42.927
I guess it'll
give us a chance

33:42.996 --> 33:44.725
to kind of show ourselves off,

33:44.797 --> 33:47.357
and the car is looking great again.

33:47.433 --> 33:48.365
Great.

33:51.371 --> 33:53.032
Her mom looked...

33:53.106 --> 33:54.539
very elegant.

33:56.075 --> 33:57.508
You're elegant, Mom.

34:00.246 --> 34:01.543
We both are.

34:01.614 --> 34:03.377
We've got taste, huh?

34:03.449 --> 34:04.711
That's one thing-
People look at us, and they say,

34:04.784 --> 34:08.686
"Look at that great-looking
mother and daughter."

34:09.755 --> 34:10.688
Where do they live?

34:11.991 --> 34:13.322
Mom, why are you doing this?

34:13.393 --> 34:15.121
Which one is it, honey?
Point it out.

34:15.194 --> 34:16.456
That one.

34:16.529 --> 34:17.996
Now let's go home.

34:18.063 --> 34:20.554
Oh, my God.

34:24.370 --> 34:28.033
It goes all the way
around the block.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.902
Yeah.
We're going to a party tonight.

34:30.976 --> 34:32.877
Yeah. Mom and I are both going.

34:32.945 --> 34:34.139
Do you want to talk to her again?

34:34.213 --> 34:36.340
Just say merry Christmas.

34:36.416 --> 34:37.382
Merry Christmas.

34:37.449 --> 34:39.782
Merry Christmas to everybody.

34:39.851 --> 34:43.413
I love you.
Give a big hug to Benny for me.

34:43.489 --> 34:46.617
Ok. Bye-bye.
Love you. Bye.

34:46.692 --> 34:48.056
I'm going to go get dressed

34:48.127 --> 34:51.062
and try on my new necklace.

35:11.751 --> 35:13.651
Mom, it's 4:00.

35:13.719 --> 35:16.586
Are you going to get dressed?

35:16.656 --> 35:19.181
It takes you an hour
to get ready. We're-

35:19.258 --> 35:21.283
The party's going to be over by then.

35:23.029 --> 35:24.257
I thought you said
you wanted to go.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.490
Honey, what I want

35:25.565 --> 35:28.193
is to get all of these pine needles

35:28.267 --> 35:29.632
and vacuum those closets.

35:29.702 --> 35:30.691
They're filled with dust.

35:30.770 --> 35:32.670
And maybe wash the kitchen floor,

35:32.738 --> 35:33.864
because I realized, sweetheart,

35:33.940 --> 35:36.170
that the thing that's going
to make me most happy

35:36.242 --> 35:37.539
is to just look around this place

35:37.610 --> 35:40.408
and see that it is spick-and-span.

35:41.981 --> 35:44.609
But it's the one fun thing
we can do for Christmas.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.675
Well, then, you should go.
You should definitely go.

35:46.752 --> 35:48.583
I mean, all your friends are
going to be there, right?

35:48.654 --> 35:50.519
And that boy Peter-
Is that his name?

35:50.590 --> 35:52.615
He'll be there, right?

35:52.692 --> 35:55.354
What are you going to do?
It's Christmas.

35:55.428 --> 35:56.986
Oh, don't worry about me.

35:57.063 --> 35:58.530
I've just got a million things

35:58.598 --> 35:59.758
that I'm going to do.

35:59.832 --> 36:02.232
I want our first Christmas

36:02.301 --> 36:05.236
in Los Angeles to be perfect.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.110
Aren't things-
Aren't things bad enough here?

36:15.181 --> 36:16.705
I don't know
why you're doing this to me.

36:21.053 --> 36:23.749
You're right.
I'm sorry.

36:23.823 --> 36:25.085
Want me to drive you there?

36:25.158 --> 36:26.318
- Want me to drive you?
- No.

36:26.392 --> 36:27.654
- No.
- Yeah.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.661
No.
I can walk.

36:33.399 --> 36:36.129
All right, well, then, go.

36:38.337 --> 36:39.770
Go ahead.

36:41.307 --> 36:43.673
Otherwise, we're just going
to hang around here all day

36:43.743 --> 36:47.235
talking about our silly
little lives, huh?

36:47.313 --> 36:50.009
Oh, gosh, I just had the...

36:50.082 --> 36:52.983
strongest memory of my father.

36:53.052 --> 36:54.349
I'm going to go.
I'm going to be late.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.684
I'm sorry that you never
really got to know

36:56.756 --> 37:00.248
your grandfather or
your father, for that matter,

37:00.326 --> 37:01.725
and I know it means
something to you

37:01.794 --> 37:03.887
to find your father,

37:03.963 --> 37:05.225
sweetie.

37:06.399 --> 37:08.094
I promise.

37:08.167 --> 37:09.099
We will.

37:09.168 --> 37:10.362
- I'm going.
- Ok.

37:10.436 --> 37:11.630
I'm going.

37:11.704 --> 37:13.467
And maybe we can, um...

37:13.539 --> 37:15.769
We'll talk about your father
when you come back.

37:17.310 --> 37:18.971
I'll be here.
I'm not going anywhere.

37:19.045 --> 37:20.802
I'll wait.

38:06.281 --> 38:08.215
I wish for a place

38:09.484 --> 38:12.578
Where the earth doesn't shake

38:12.654 --> 38:15.088
And if the earth won't be still

38:16.658 --> 38:18.717
Then you and I will

38:27.569 --> 38:31.003
Mmm

38:37.579 --> 38:39.672
I'm sorry.

38:39.748 --> 38:42.683
I thought I could go, but...

38:44.653 --> 38:46.086
I couldn't.

38:55.530 --> 38:58.658
You know what we need?

38:58.733 --> 39:00.701
Some sugar in our blood.

39:00.769 --> 39:04.705
You want to get some ice cream?

39:04.773 --> 39:06.900
I don't want ice cream.

39:06.975 --> 39:08.408
Sure, you do.

39:09.577 --> 39:11.067
Is that what I want, Mom?

39:13.448 --> 39:15.177
It would cheer us up.

39:15.250 --> 39:18.742
Ok, Mother,
let's get our sugar.

39:20.488 --> 39:22.251
And they've got a new flavor.

39:22.324 --> 39:23.552
Great.

39:23.625 --> 39:25.058
Let's go.

39:26.127 --> 39:29.028
I'll get your jacket.

39:30.165 --> 39:31.325
Just one little-

39:31.399 --> 39:33.264
No, no, no, no, no.
We close early today.

39:33.335 --> 39:34.927
Nothing?
It's Christmas.

39:35.003 --> 39:35.992
Ay.

39:36.071 --> 39:37.333
Christmas.

39:37.405 --> 39:38.872
Oh, my God.

39:38.940 --> 39:41.033
Merry Christmas, Officer.

39:41.109 --> 39:42.406
You're not working today, are you?

39:42.477 --> 39:44.069
You see that red curb, ma'am?

39:44.145 --> 39:46.010
See that "No Stopping" sign?

39:46.081 --> 39:48.413
- Oh. Oh.
- Give me your driver's license, please.

39:48.483 --> 39:50.474
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

39:50.552 --> 39:51.519
Did you see-

39:51.586 --> 39:53.110
I was just here
to get her an ice cream.

39:53.188 --> 39:55.622
- She needed an ice cream.
- Don't blame it on me.

39:55.690 --> 39:57.555
I'm just explaining
to the officer, sweetheart.

39:57.625 --> 39:59.388
- I hate it when you do this.
- What?

39:59.461 --> 40:00.689
You always do this to me.
You always-

40:00.762 --> 40:03.128
I was explaining to him
it's our Christmas tradition-

40:03.198 --> 40:04.995
I didn't even want ice cream.
She wanted ice cream.

40:05.066 --> 40:06.090
Ann, where are you going?

40:06.167 --> 40:07.099
She'll be back.

40:07.168 --> 40:08.135
Excuse me.
She won't be back.

40:08.203 --> 40:10.103
Hey, hey, hey.
You stay by the car, ok?

40:10.171 --> 40:11.103
Ann?

40:11.172 --> 40:12.537
Lady, wait by the car!

40:12.607 --> 40:13.972
All right.

40:14.042 --> 40:14.974
Ann, come here.

40:15.043 --> 40:15.975
Ann.

40:16.044 --> 40:17.477
Wait.

40:17.545 --> 40:18.603
It was her idea to park there.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.545
I told her not to park there.

40:20.615 --> 40:22.378
I didn't even want any ice cream.

40:22.450 --> 40:23.678
Your mother's trying
to beat a ticket.

40:23.752 --> 40:25.652
Give her one.
She already has a drawer full of them.

40:25.720 --> 40:26.652
Now, now.

40:26.721 --> 40:27.915
Don't talk to me
like a little girl.

40:27.989 --> 40:28.978
I'm not a little girl.

40:31.393 --> 40:33.156
You don't even understand.

40:33.228 --> 40:35.219
I'm going to leave her
one of these days.

40:36.664 --> 40:38.188
I'm sure you will,

40:38.266 --> 40:39.198
but not today.

40:39.267 --> 40:40.529
Why not today?

40:40.602 --> 40:41.569
Well...

40:41.636 --> 40:44.799
you should leave her
when you're calm...

40:44.873 --> 40:46.306
when you're rational.

40:48.643 --> 40:50.907
You leave her
when you're ready not to come back.

40:50.979 --> 40:51.911
You understand?

40:55.316 --> 40:57.477
You from Wisconsin?

40:57.552 --> 40:59.782
How do you know?

40:59.854 --> 41:01.412
Well, your plates.

41:01.489 --> 41:03.889
- You living here now?
- Yes.

41:03.958 --> 41:08.327
- Hey, Ann.
- Lady, I want you to register that car.

41:08.396 --> 41:09.522
Yes, sir.

41:09.597 --> 41:11.497
I want you to get
a California driver's license.

41:11.566 --> 41:14.228
From now on,
start paying attention to the signs.

41:14.302 --> 41:15.428
Yes, sir.

41:15.503 --> 41:17.130
I'm going to be rolling by
in another 2 minutes.

41:17.205 --> 41:19.036
I don't want to see
that vehicle out there.

41:19.107 --> 41:20.574
Yes, sir.

41:20.642 --> 41:21.734
Good.

41:24.579 --> 41:26.171
Merry Christmas, Ann.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.680
Let's move up here.

41:34.756 --> 41:37.156
Did he just wink at you?

41:37.225 --> 41:40.661
That's an unusual
law enforcement officer.

41:40.728 --> 41:42.696
What did he say to you?

41:42.764 --> 41:44.391
He said not to ever
do that to me again.

41:44.466 --> 41:45.398
He said that if you do,

41:45.467 --> 41:46.764
he'll have you taken off to prison

41:46.835 --> 41:47.859
and locked up,

41:47.936 --> 41:49.426
and you'll never, ever see me again,

41:49.504 --> 41:53.565
and you'll have to eat
ice cream on your own.

41:53.641 --> 41:55.268
You went too far
with the ice cream business.

41:55.343 --> 41:56.332
He did not say that.

41:56.411 --> 41:57.742
- Yes, he did.
- No, he did not.

41:57.812 --> 41:59.541
And he wants to adopt me.
He finds me very attractive.

41:59.614 --> 42:01.104
That is not funny.

42:01.182 --> 42:02.877
You do not do this again.

42:02.951 --> 42:03.883
Don't you do this again.

42:03.952 --> 42:04.884
No, don't you do this again.

42:04.953 --> 42:06.648
No, it's you.

42:06.721 --> 42:08.018
Look...

42:08.089 --> 42:10.683
I was just trying to get out
of a parking ticket.

42:10.758 --> 42:11.782
Well, you didn't get one, did you?

42:11.860 --> 42:12.952
Thank you, Ann.
Thank you, Ann,

42:13.027 --> 42:15.461
and your fiancé will be
back here in 2 minutes

42:15.530 --> 42:17.498
to see if we've moved the car.

42:17.565 --> 42:19.430
I will always love that policeman.

42:19.501 --> 42:20.490
That was all me.

42:20.568 --> 42:23.628
He told me what I needed to know.

42:23.705 --> 42:25.263
I will always carry a soft spot

42:25.340 --> 42:27.467
for the Los Angeles Police Department.

42:30.778 --> 42:33.645
I wish he had adopted me.

42:36.784 --> 42:37.751
Grandma told me in a letter

42:37.819 --> 42:39.218
that my father got remarried

42:39.287 --> 42:42.586
and was living in Reno.

42:42.657 --> 42:46.115
How many Hisham Badirs
could there be in Reno?

42:49.797 --> 42:52.027
Hi. Do you have a number for...

42:52.100 --> 42:55.797
for a Mr. Hisham Badir, please?

42:55.870 --> 42:58.737
B-a-d-i-r.

42:58.806 --> 42:59.738
Residence.

42:59.807 --> 43:02.674
H-i-s-h-a-m.

43:06.047 --> 43:07.480
Thank you.

43:14.589 --> 43:16.022
Ok. Thank you.

43:17.091 --> 43:18.023
Bye.

43:27.135 --> 43:28.796
When I was younger,

43:28.870 --> 43:31.100
my mother always hummed
one of my father's tunes

43:31.172 --> 43:33.538
before we went to sleep.

43:33.608 --> 43:36.543
He wrote my mother love songs.

43:40.415 --> 43:42.076
Sometimes, I would imagine my father

43:42.150 --> 43:44.584
showing up to rescue me.

43:48.923 --> 43:50.481
Hi, Ann.

43:50.558 --> 43:52.958
Hello, Peter.

43:53.027 --> 43:55.495
You got that
isosceles triangle thing straight?

43:55.563 --> 43:57.030
Mm-hmm.

43:58.166 --> 43:59.599
That baffles me.

44:02.937 --> 44:04.427
Hey, I got a new trumpet.
You want to see it?

44:06.574 --> 44:08.371
I'm working, Peter.

44:08.443 --> 44:09.910
Right.
Sorry.

44:13.481 --> 44:15.005
Your mom's really pretty.

44:15.083 --> 44:16.550
I'll tell her.

44:19.587 --> 44:20.576
What's your dad do?

44:22.757 --> 44:23.883
He's a songwriter.

44:25.159 --> 44:27.252
Really?
I write some songs.

44:27.328 --> 44:28.590
Yeah. You want to hear one?

44:28.663 --> 44:30.528
Not now, Peter.

44:31.833 --> 44:33.460
You want to feel my pulse?

44:35.103 --> 44:37.037
It's beating really fast.

44:42.844 --> 44:43.776
Ba-bum,

44:43.845 --> 44:45.403
ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum,

44:45.480 --> 44:46.811
ba-bum, ba-bum.

44:48.182 --> 44:49.649
Really fast.

44:52.920 --> 44:53.852
I don't understand.

44:53.921 --> 44:55.252
I have been telling you for weeks

44:55.323 --> 44:56.381
that the tiles are chipped.

44:56.457 --> 44:57.617
There's no water pressure.

44:57.692 --> 45:00.160
The handles are coming off
of the cabinets.

45:00.228 --> 45:01.923
Now, you don't have a life.
What's the problem?

45:01.996 --> 45:04.692
Can't you-Hey!
I am talking to you.

45:04.766 --> 45:06.893
Hey! Hey!

45:06.968 --> 45:08.526
Mom, your pants.

45:08.603 --> 45:11.333
I can't talk to you
like this, Mrs. August!

45:11.406 --> 45:14.102
Listen, I'm telling you that-

45:14.175 --> 45:16.109
It's not just that
the tile is chipped.

45:16.177 --> 45:17.838
The carpets are filthy.
They're filthy.

45:17.912 --> 45:20.176
I've got a fungus on my foot
from those carpets.

45:20.248 --> 45:21.875
Who was living here before,
a hockey team?

45:21.949 --> 45:24.213
I cannot live like this!

45:24.285 --> 45:25.377
You can't live like this,

45:25.453 --> 45:27.080
but you can live in
an apartment for 6 months

45:27.155 --> 45:28.622
with just a mattress on the floor?

45:28.690 --> 45:31.124
Ohh!

45:31.192 --> 45:32.625
Damn it!

45:37.432 --> 45:38.660
Ohh!

45:41.302 --> 45:43.566
Turn it down!

45:43.638 --> 45:44.764
God, I hate this place!

45:44.839 --> 45:47.933
I hate my job!
I hate my foot!

45:48.009 --> 45:48.941
Uhh!

46:01.656 --> 46:03.521
You're not having sex
with anybody, are you?

46:06.094 --> 46:07.026
What?

46:07.095 --> 46:09.154
You know.

46:09.230 --> 46:11.164
No, I don't know.

46:18.740 --> 46:20.071
We have to get out of here.

46:20.141 --> 46:21.938
We can't.
We have a lease.

46:22.009 --> 46:26.946
What do you mean,
am I having sex with anyone?

46:36.855 --> 46:39.323
We moved anyway.

46:39.390 --> 46:41.085
Shh, shh, shh.

46:41.159 --> 46:42.820
Over the next year,

46:42.894 --> 46:44.885
we moved a lot.

46:44.963 --> 46:46.692
We got used to it.

46:46.764 --> 46:47.992
Oh, honey, let me help you.

46:48.066 --> 46:49.090
Here.

46:49.167 --> 46:51.135
That's a girl. Ok.
It's apartment number 8?

46:51.202 --> 46:53.136
Yeah, number 8. Ohh.

46:53.204 --> 46:56.173
At least this one had furniture,
thanks to Miss Letterfine.

46:56.241 --> 46:57.265
Thank you.

46:57.342 --> 46:58.468
Thanks.

46:58.543 --> 47:00.340
Gail and Mom
have become good friends.

47:03.348 --> 47:04.280
Cheers.

47:04.349 --> 47:06.283
It's so colorful. Look.

47:06.351 --> 47:08.182
My mom dragged me
to an audition.

47:08.253 --> 47:09.550
- Hello.
- Hi.

47:09.621 --> 47:12.522
She would not give up on her fantasy
of me becoming an actress.

47:12.590 --> 47:15.058
What's your social security number,
sweetheart?

47:15.126 --> 47:16.388
Uh...

47:16.461 --> 47:17.393
Ann?

47:17.462 --> 47:20.295
We did our work

47:20.365 --> 47:21.627
and kept healthy.

47:21.699 --> 47:23.223
And exhale.

47:23.301 --> 47:25.428
Draw your navel
to your backbone.

47:25.503 --> 47:26.800
And when summer came,
we went to the beach

47:26.871 --> 47:29.465
and felt sorry
for everyone back home.

47:29.540 --> 47:30.837
Where are you going?

47:30.909 --> 47:32.137
I think right over there.

47:32.210 --> 47:33.404
There's no people over there.

47:33.478 --> 47:35.946
I know.
I need some peace and quiet today.

47:36.014 --> 47:37.606
You just want to be
near that beach club.

47:37.682 --> 47:39.343
Yes, please.

47:39.417 --> 47:40.975
I'm open.
I'm open.

47:41.052 --> 47:42.542
He's over there.

47:42.620 --> 47:44.087
Yo, Nick.

47:46.858 --> 47:49.122
Here's a good spot.

47:49.193 --> 47:50.319
There you go.

47:50.395 --> 47:53.956
You guys feel like playing
some middleman?

47:54.032 --> 47:55.795
Sweetie, you have
a cute little body.

47:55.867 --> 47:57.164
You should show it off more.

47:57.235 --> 47:58.429
You should show off your body.

47:58.503 --> 48:00.801
I plan to, but-
Where are you going?

48:00.872 --> 48:02.100
Japan.

48:02.173 --> 48:03.401
- Heads up.
- Aah!

48:03.474 --> 48:04.964
Sorry about that.

48:06.711 --> 48:08.440
That's ok.

48:15.954 --> 48:18.047
Ooh!

48:18.122 --> 48:19.919
You're strong.

48:22.360 --> 48:23.292
Wild thing.

48:23.361 --> 48:25.829
Hey, Josh, I'm open.

48:27.832 --> 48:28.764
Aw!

49:10.441 --> 49:12.966
Oh, shame on you.

49:16.080 --> 49:17.513
Oh, Ann.

49:17.582 --> 49:18.640
Ann, come here, sweetie.

49:18.716 --> 49:20.343
This is Dr. Spritzer.

49:20.418 --> 49:22.147
This is my daughter Ann.

49:22.220 --> 49:23.778
Ah, a big girl.

49:23.855 --> 49:26.847
Oh, yes.
We're more like sisters.

49:26.924 --> 49:28.323
So, you're the actress, I hear.

49:28.393 --> 49:30.088
Oh, no, not me. Her.
My mom's the actress.

49:30.161 --> 49:32.061
Oh, silly girl.
Don't be shy.

49:32.130 --> 49:33.961
Dr. Spritzer's an orthodontist,

49:34.032 --> 49:35.556
and he works with the actresses.

49:35.633 --> 49:37.100
He did Heather Locklear.

49:37.168 --> 49:39.033
Her teeth.

49:39.103 --> 49:41.367
I was telling the doctor
that just this morning,

49:41.439 --> 49:42.872
we were discussing your overbite.

49:42.940 --> 49:44.464
See what a great smile she has?

49:44.542 --> 49:46.373
The bottom is just
a little strange.

49:46.444 --> 49:48.105
They don't look
so strange to me.

49:48.179 --> 49:49.111
Josh!

49:49.180 --> 49:50.408
Come on!

49:50.481 --> 49:51.413
Ahem.

49:51.482 --> 49:52.642
Be right there.

49:52.717 --> 49:53.649
Adele.

49:53.718 --> 49:54.980
Yes, Josh.

49:55.053 --> 49:55.985
You play good ball.

49:56.054 --> 49:58.147
You, too.

49:58.222 --> 49:59.348
Take care of those two-fers, now.

49:59.424 --> 50:00.982
An actress has to keep smiling.

50:01.059 --> 50:04.093
See you.

50:07.031 --> 50:09.499
That's probably his wife.

50:09.567 --> 50:11.762
Why'd you have to talk
about my teeth?

50:11.836 --> 50:13.064
It won't last long.

50:13.204 --> 50:14.933
Mom?

50:15.006 --> 50:16.667
- Mom? Mom?
- Ann?

50:16.741 --> 50:17.901
- Mom, guess what.
- What?

50:17.975 --> 50:18.907
Benny's coming.

50:18.976 --> 50:19.908
Yes!

50:19.977 --> 50:21.501
Ohh!

50:21.579 --> 50:23.547
Oh, it's so good to see you.

50:23.614 --> 50:25.582
Come on, come on,
come on, my turn.

50:25.650 --> 50:27.709
Oh, how are you doing?

50:27.785 --> 50:30.219
I was just out of high school

50:30.288 --> 50:32.916
So what do you think so far, Benny?

50:32.990 --> 50:34.855
You've got more Mercedes cars
on one street

50:34.926 --> 50:36.985
than we've got in all of Wisconsin.

50:37.061 --> 50:38.494
Benny wants to see a movie star.

50:38.563 --> 50:39.996
Really?
Who do you want to see?

50:40.064 --> 50:41.395
I don't care.
I just want to see one.

50:41.466 --> 50:42.728
How about the babes in Baywatch?

50:42.800 --> 50:44.097
Yeah.

50:45.169 --> 50:50.232
Chotee

50:50.308 --> 50:53.004
So young, so confused

50:53.077 --> 50:55.705
What was I to do?

50:55.780 --> 50:58.010
I'm so sorry, Chotee

50:58.082 --> 51:00.016
Look it's a perfect fit.

51:00.084 --> 51:02.052
Yeah, me, too, with Donald.

51:05.356 --> 51:06.618
Look, guys.

51:06.691 --> 51:09.023
Smile.

51:09.093 --> 51:10.958
Let me take it.
Let me take it.

51:12.763 --> 51:15.789
Maybe you can come back
for a visit?

51:15.867 --> 51:17.596
I'll teach you
how to drive the truck.

51:20.605 --> 51:22.869
I'd like that.

51:29.147 --> 51:30.341
You know what?

51:30.414 --> 51:31.381
What?

51:31.449 --> 51:33.041
Your boobs are getting big.

51:33.117 --> 51:34.243
Shut up.

51:35.453 --> 51:38.445
Mary Girling and Julie Eastman-

51:38.523 --> 51:40.047
Gettin' really big ones.

51:40.124 --> 51:41.682
Don't be gross.

51:41.759 --> 51:43.886
Oh, boobs aren't gross.

51:43.961 --> 51:45.053
Boobs are beautiful.

51:46.964 --> 51:48.932
Shh.

51:53.237 --> 51:55.501
Ew!

51:55.573 --> 52:00.369
You are so gross.

52:07.151 --> 52:08.550
You got a boyfriend?

52:10.588 --> 52:12.419
Maybe.

52:12.490 --> 52:13.980
Who?

52:14.058 --> 52:16.151
Do you go to bed with him?

52:16.227 --> 52:18.752
Mm-hmm.

52:18.829 --> 52:20.990
3, maybe 4 times a day.

52:24.468 --> 52:26.333
What about you?

52:26.404 --> 52:27.701
You gettin' laid, Benny?

52:40.218 --> 52:41.150
Susie?

52:44.255 --> 52:45.688
Shh.

52:46.924 --> 52:48.186
Ew.

52:49.694 --> 52:52.185
You put the wood
to Susie Goodman?

52:52.263 --> 52:54.959
Uh-huh.

52:55.032 --> 52:57.193
3, sometimes 4 times a day.

52:57.268 --> 52:59.293
Shut up.

53:05.943 --> 53:08.707
And tell your mother that next summer,
everybody comes out.

53:08.779 --> 53:11.577
We've got our eye on this cute
little house not far from the water.

53:11.649 --> 53:12.581
Ok.

53:12.650 --> 53:15.278
And tell her how brown
Ann and I are.

53:15.353 --> 53:16.980
We don't look bad, do we?

53:17.054 --> 53:18.453
No. You look real brown.

53:18.522 --> 53:21.787
And you tell her, well,
how healthy we are.

53:21.859 --> 53:23.850
Well, you've always
looked healthy, Aunt Adele.

53:23.928 --> 53:26.522
Yeah, but not this healthy, right? Huh?

53:26.597 --> 53:28.656
Here, this is for you.

53:28.733 --> 53:31.167
And have a great flight, sweetie.

53:34.372 --> 53:35.669
Bye.

53:40.278 --> 53:42.473
Ok. Bye.

53:42.546 --> 53:43.911
Bye.

53:43.981 --> 53:45.778
Thanks.

53:45.850 --> 53:47.909
Say hello to Ted for me.

53:47.985 --> 53:49.111
Thank you.

53:49.186 --> 53:51.120
Is he seeing anybody?

53:51.188 --> 53:53.053
May we have
your attention, please?

53:53.124 --> 53:54.056
Thank you.

53:54.125 --> 53:56.150
This is a security announcement.

53:56.227 --> 53:57.592
All persons are reminded

53:57.662 --> 54:01.233
not to leave their baggage
unattended at any time.

54:15.648 --> 54:16.615
Ann?

54:19.251 --> 54:20.548
Ann?

54:23.389 --> 54:24.651
Ann?

54:27.526 --> 54:28.652
Ann?

54:42.941 --> 54:43.965
I can't find my daughter.

54:44.043 --> 54:46.477
She was right here,
now I can't find her.

54:46.545 --> 54:47.978
- Mom?
- Where did you go?

54:48.047 --> 54:49.071
I was right here.

54:49.148 --> 54:50.274
I was looking
all over for you.

54:50.349 --> 54:51.646
I couldn't find you anywhere.

54:51.717 --> 54:53.309
It's ok.
I was gone for 5 seconds.

54:53.385 --> 54:54.443
Don't you ever
do that again.

54:54.520 --> 54:55.452
I couldn't find you.

54:55.521 --> 54:56.453
Shh, shh.

54:56.522 --> 54:57.853
I didn't know where you were.

54:57.923 --> 54:59.288
It's ok, Mom.
I'm here.

54:59.358 --> 55:01.223
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

55:01.293 --> 55:02.260
It's all right.

55:09.301 --> 55:11.599
You get it.

55:12.738 --> 55:14.069
You get it.

55:16.408 --> 55:17.500
You get it.

55:17.576 --> 55:19.043
Tch.

55:20.813 --> 55:21.780
Hello?

55:22.981 --> 55:24.107
Just a minute.

55:24.183 --> 55:26.447
- For you.
- Who is it?

55:28.287 --> 55:29.413
Who's speaking?

55:30.556 --> 55:33.218
Josh Spritzer.
Josh Spritzer.

55:33.292 --> 55:34.987
Oh, God.

55:35.060 --> 55:37.528
The guy from the beach,
the orthodontist.

55:37.596 --> 55:38.528
Hi.

55:38.597 --> 55:40.189
Yeah, of course I remember.

55:40.265 --> 55:42.165
At the beach.
Uh-huh.

55:43.502 --> 55:45.163
I've thought of you, too.

55:45.237 --> 55:48.798
I'm surprised that you
tracked down my number.

55:48.874 --> 55:51.001
Oh, I wrote it
on the football.

55:51.076 --> 55:52.373
Ha ha ha ha!

55:52.444 --> 55:54.878
Oh, that's so naughty of me.

55:57.316 --> 55:58.806
Oh.

55:58.884 --> 56:01.682
Oh, I'm so sorry.

56:01.754 --> 56:05.918
Separations can be so painful.

56:05.991 --> 56:06.958
Oh, yeah.

56:07.025 --> 56:07.992
When I broke up with my ex,

56:08.060 --> 56:10.324
I mean,
I could barely breathe.

56:10.396 --> 56:11.385
Mm-hmm.

56:11.463 --> 56:14.159
Yeah. Well, tonight?

56:15.234 --> 56:16.599
No, tonight's not good.

56:16.668 --> 56:18.693
How about, um... tomorrow?

56:18.771 --> 56:21.934
Uh-huh.
I love the place.

56:22.007 --> 56:23.634
7:00.

56:23.709 --> 56:25.574
Great.
I'll see you then.

56:25.644 --> 56:28.272
Ok.

56:28.347 --> 56:29.678
Me, too.

56:33.185 --> 56:35.153
I've been feeling it all day.

56:35.220 --> 56:37.313
It has been in the air all week.

56:37.389 --> 56:38.321
Oh, my God.

56:38.390 --> 56:39.584
What to wear,
what to wear,

56:39.658 --> 56:40.625
what to wear.

56:40.692 --> 56:42.159
Focus. Shoes.

56:42.227 --> 56:44.092
It would be tragic
to be wearing the wrong shoes

56:44.163 --> 56:45.494
when you meet the right guy.

56:45.564 --> 56:46.929
I'm gonna go shopping.

56:48.000 --> 56:48.989
Rob Roy.

56:49.067 --> 56:50.261
Thank you.

56:50.335 --> 56:51.393
Martini straight.

56:51.470 --> 56:52.494
Thanks, man.

57:00.012 --> 57:01.479
Olive?

57:02.815 --> 57:04.282
I love olives.

57:11.156 --> 57:12.680
Cherry?

57:12.758 --> 57:13.690
Yeah.

57:30.476 --> 57:31.568
Pooh Bear?

57:32.644 --> 57:33.668
Sweetie?

57:35.047 --> 57:36.344
Sweet pea?

57:42.287 --> 57:46.115
Hi.

57:46.191 --> 57:47.488
You ok?

57:47.559 --> 57:48.753
Where were you?

57:50.295 --> 57:53.753
Finding out
I didn't die in Bay City.

57:53.832 --> 57:55.629
Oh.

57:55.701 --> 57:56.759
"Oh" what?

57:56.835 --> 57:59.668
I don't know.

57:59.738 --> 58:01.467
What time is it?

58:01.540 --> 58:02.507
5:00.

58:04.042 --> 58:06.977
Mmm, we just clicked.

58:07.045 --> 58:08.979
We just clicked, sweetie.

58:11.550 --> 58:13.780
Let's go watch the sunrise.

58:13.852 --> 58:15.615
I need to sleep.

58:15.687 --> 58:16.881
I'm starving.

58:16.955 --> 58:18.286
I have to go to school, Mom.

58:18.357 --> 58:20.917
Come on, I'll tell you all about him.

58:20.993 --> 58:22.620
It's the middle of the night.

58:22.694 --> 58:26.323
He's more than just a dentist.

58:26.398 --> 58:28.889
He's writing a screenplay.

58:32.137 --> 58:35.106
Come on. Hmm?
Come on, sweetie.

58:35.173 --> 58:36.834
Just this once. Come on.

58:38.043 --> 58:39.442
Come on. Come on.

58:39.511 --> 58:40.671
Come on.

58:40.746 --> 58:42.873
That's a girl.

58:52.624 --> 58:54.558
Did he say he loved you?

58:56.028 --> 58:57.620
Well, grown ups

58:57.696 --> 59:00.665
don't really say things
like that right away,

59:00.732 --> 59:03.394
especially if they've
been married before.

59:03.468 --> 59:05.766
You know, it takes a little time.

59:07.639 --> 59:12.201
But... he did do something that...

59:12.277 --> 59:15.041
grown ups do sometimes that shows...

59:15.113 --> 59:18.207
that they really care about you.

59:18.283 --> 59:19.580
What did he do?

59:22.621 --> 59:25.522
Well, honey,
it's something that...

59:25.591 --> 59:27.582
It's something that...

59:27.659 --> 59:29.923
adults do in bed.

59:29.995 --> 59:31.121
Sometimes.

59:31.196 --> 59:32.959
I mean, not everybody.

59:33.031 --> 59:36.000
I... especially
in Bay City, but...

59:36.068 --> 59:37.501
Ted never did it?

59:37.569 --> 59:40.504
Oh, please.
I was lucky if I could get Ted

59:40.572 --> 59:42.233
to take off his ice skates.

59:42.307 --> 59:44.070
Did my father do it?

59:44.142 --> 59:45.575
Let's not talk about this now,
sweetie, ok?

59:45.644 --> 59:46.906
It's just something that...

59:46.979 --> 59:48.844
just shows that
you're really serious.

59:48.914 --> 59:50.279
You just don't...

59:50.349 --> 59:52.613
You don't do it with every woman.

59:52.684 --> 59:53.616
Really?

59:53.685 --> 59:54.652
Mm-hmm.

59:56.054 --> 59:59.023
Oh, it's difficult for you
when I feel something,

59:59.091 --> 01:00:00.023
isn't it?

01:00:00.092 --> 01:00:02.253
You know, I had that dream again.

01:00:02.327 --> 01:00:03.988
You cut off your feet,
and you couldn't move,

01:00:04.062 --> 01:00:06.257
and I couldn't get you
to leave the room.

01:00:06.331 --> 01:00:08.925
Oh, sweetie,
I'm never gonna leave you.

01:00:09.001 --> 01:00:10.127
Don't worry.

01:00:10.202 --> 01:00:12.295
You don't have to
cut off my feet.

01:00:12.371 --> 01:00:13.463
I understand.

01:00:13.538 --> 01:00:17.269
I'm not a doctor of psychology
for nothing.

01:00:17.342 --> 01:00:20.675
You're not a doctor
of psychology, Mom.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.914
I wonder what time it is.

01:00:23.982 --> 01:00:25.677
I really want to hear
his voice again.

01:00:25.751 --> 01:00:27.810
Oh, sweetie, we made
the right choice, didn't we,

01:00:27.886 --> 01:00:28.875
by coming here.

01:00:28.954 --> 01:00:30.717
I know that it was hard
in the beginning,

01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:33.189
but look at us.
Look at us now, huh?

01:00:33.258 --> 01:00:34.850
And look at this day,

01:00:34.926 --> 01:00:37.087
look at this place,
and look at you, and...

01:00:37.162 --> 01:00:41.155
You're gonna be
getting braces soon, and...

01:00:41.233 --> 01:00:42.894
when your teeth are straight,

01:00:42.968 --> 01:00:46.096
your face is gonna be just perfect.

01:00:46.171 --> 01:00:47.195
Hmm?

01:01:00.485 --> 01:01:01.884
Good morning.

01:01:01.953 --> 01:01:03.511
It's me.

01:01:03.588 --> 01:01:04.555
Adele.

01:01:04.623 --> 01:01:06.250
I didn't wake you, did I?

01:01:06.324 --> 01:01:09.384
I just wanted you to know
that I'm still...

01:01:09.461 --> 01:01:12.760
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
You are sleeping.

01:01:12.831 --> 01:01:14.196
Go back to bed, yeah.

01:01:14.266 --> 01:01:16.461
I'll - Call me later?

01:01:16.535 --> 01:01:17.593
Ok.

01:01:17.669 --> 01:01:18.966
Oh, and, Josh,

01:01:19.037 --> 01:01:21.437
I'm really looking
forward to Sunday.

01:01:22.507 --> 01:01:23.599
The opera?

01:01:25.711 --> 01:01:27.110
Oh, I-I must have misunderstood.

01:01:27.179 --> 01:01:30.171
I thought you said
you had tickets.

01:01:30.248 --> 01:01:31.442
Uh-huh.

01:01:31.516 --> 01:01:33.609
Oh. No, you don't
have to apologize.

01:01:33.685 --> 01:01:34.947
I- I totally understand.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.250
Yeah. Ok.

01:01:37.322 --> 01:01:39.017
Go back to bed.

01:01:39.091 --> 01:01:41.082
Call me later.

01:01:41.159 --> 01:01:43.184
Oh, and you know what?

01:01:43.261 --> 01:01:45.889
This has been super special
for me, Josh.

01:01:45.964 --> 01:01:46.896
Yeah.

01:01:46.965 --> 01:01:49.195
All right.

01:01:50.902 --> 01:01:53.393
Go back to bed.
Talk to you later.

01:01:53.472 --> 01:01:54.837
Sweet dreams.

01:01:55.907 --> 01:01:57.169
I love you.

01:01:58.777 --> 01:01:59.835
Hello?

01:02:01.113 --> 01:02:02.137
Hello?

01:02:37.449 --> 01:02:39.212
Mom? Mom!

01:02:40.585 --> 01:02:42.212
What do you think, darling?

01:02:42.287 --> 01:02:45.154
Is it too much for the opera?

01:02:45.223 --> 01:02:46.349
You're going to the opera?

01:02:46.424 --> 01:02:47.755
- Ha! Yeah!
- Great!

01:02:49.961 --> 01:02:50.950
So, when are you going?

01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:52.496
Well, Josh said
that they're playing

01:02:52.564 --> 01:02:54.327
a couple of times next week.

01:02:54.399 --> 01:02:56.060
He hasn't told me
what specific date.

01:02:56.134 --> 01:02:57.101
Which do you think?

01:02:57.169 --> 01:02:59.296
The red scarf or the white scarf?

01:02:59.371 --> 01:03:00.861
I don't know.

01:03:00.939 --> 01:03:03.134
You have talked to him?
He did call, didn't he?

01:03:03.208 --> 01:03:05.472
Pumpkin, he's going to call.

01:03:05.544 --> 01:03:07.102
He said he would.
He'll call.

01:03:07.179 --> 01:03:08.976
He's a Beverly Hills dentist.
They're busy.

01:03:09.047 --> 01:03:09.979
What do you think?

01:03:10.048 --> 01:03:12.380
Low-heel? High-heel?
Hmm?

01:03:13.819 --> 01:03:15.343
Ooh.

01:03:17.956 --> 01:03:18.923
Hello?

01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:20.048
Is it him?

01:03:21.726 --> 01:03:22.715
Oh, Jesus.

01:03:22.794 --> 01:03:24.318
What is it?

01:03:26.431 --> 01:03:27.693
Where's Mama?

01:03:29.334 --> 01:03:31.598
Is she in the hospital?

01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:33.069
Is Carol with her?

01:03:36.374 --> 01:03:39.104
Well - Well, we will.
Of course we will.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.411
Who was that?

01:03:43.481 --> 01:03:45.415
It was Uncle Jimmy.

01:03:45.483 --> 01:03:46.745
Grandma's had a stroke.

01:03:46.818 --> 01:03:48.115
Oh, no.

01:03:48.186 --> 01:03:51.212
Is she gonna be all right?

01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:53.280
I don't know. Maybe.

01:03:54.459 --> 01:03:56.324
Oh, honey.

01:03:58.797 --> 01:04:00.355
There was an accident.

01:04:06.271 --> 01:04:08.136
Benny was killed riding home

01:04:08.206 --> 01:04:09.605
in Jay Brosek's truck.

01:04:23.255 --> 01:04:25.655
I'm sorry.

01:04:33.698 --> 01:04:38.601
I will remember you

01:04:40.279 --> 01:04:45.615
Will you remember me?

01:04:46.919 --> 01:04:50.355
Don't let your life

01:04:50.422 --> 01:04:55.086
Pass you by

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.596
Weep not for

01:04:58.664 --> 01:05:04.193
The memories

01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:09.571
I will remember you

01:05:11.276 --> 01:05:17.181
Will you remember me?

01:05:17.249 --> 01:05:21.549
Don't let your life

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:26.648
Pass you by

01:05:26.725 --> 01:05:29.421
Weep not for

01:05:29.494 --> 01:05:32.486
I felt so sad.

01:05:32.564 --> 01:05:34.532
I had lost Benny.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.592
But I was also losing something

01:05:37.669 --> 01:05:41.469
that was once the only place
in the world for me.

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.474
The memories

01:05:43.542 --> 01:05:45.772
Now the streets weren't as wide.

01:05:47.145 --> 01:05:49.010
The trees seem lower...

01:05:50.582 --> 01:05:52.413
and the house is smaller.

01:05:56.955 --> 01:05:58.445
You look real good.

01:06:00.926 --> 01:06:02.223
But you're different.

01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:05.053
How?

01:06:09.001 --> 01:06:10.866
I don't know.

01:06:10.936 --> 01:06:12.198
Just...

01:06:12.271 --> 01:06:14.262
You seem different, too, somehow.

01:06:20.846 --> 01:06:22.108
I'm bigger.

01:06:25.384 --> 01:06:27.011
I can speak some German.

01:06:31.256 --> 01:06:33.622
That's "How's the weather today?"

01:06:34.993 --> 01:06:37.154
I like that.

01:06:43.168 --> 01:06:44.260
So...

01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:47.304
Do you think
you'll come back?

01:06:49.274 --> 01:06:50.434
I don't know.

01:06:53.478 --> 01:06:54.911
Now that I'm here...

01:06:57.416 --> 01:06:58.644
I don't know.

01:07:03.188 --> 01:07:04.815
You know what I think?

01:07:06.458 --> 01:07:08.722
I think if you were to stay,

01:07:08.794 --> 01:07:09.920
sooner or later,

01:07:09.995 --> 01:07:12.759
you'd be just like your mom-

01:07:12.831 --> 01:07:14.423
always wanting to go away.

01:07:28.647 --> 01:07:30.080
I'm calling long distance.

01:07:30.148 --> 01:07:32.582
Would you tell him
that I called again?

01:07:34.353 --> 01:07:36.913
Well, has he gotten my messages?

01:07:39.024 --> 01:07:39.991
Mm-hmm.

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.654
Ok. Well, tell him
that I'm out of state.

01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:45.822
Tell him again.

01:07:47.866 --> 01:07:49.663
And that, um...

01:07:49.735 --> 01:07:51.930
I'll be home on Sunday.

01:07:52.003 --> 01:07:53.595
Thank you.

01:08:00.445 --> 01:08:02.970
Mary Girling was right.

01:08:03.048 --> 01:08:04.709
We were different.

01:08:04.783 --> 01:08:07.513
But some things
always stayed the same.

01:08:07.586 --> 01:08:08.518
Got a light?

01:08:08.587 --> 01:08:10.214
Yeah.

01:08:10.288 --> 01:08:11.585
There was anger
that had been around

01:08:11.656 --> 01:08:13.180
as far back as I can remember.

01:08:13.258 --> 01:08:15.249
It was God's way.

01:08:15.327 --> 01:08:16.850
Shut up about God's way.

01:08:16.928 --> 01:08:18.327
Jimmy, don't.

01:08:18.397 --> 01:08:19.328
I'm sorry, Reverend.

01:08:19.398 --> 01:08:21.229
Maybe we should, um, start dinner.

01:08:21.299 --> 01:08:23.529
Sit down, Sylvia.
I'm gonna barbecue.

01:08:23.602 --> 01:08:25.569
Then why don't you start it, honey?

01:08:25.636 --> 01:08:28.367
My uncle Jimmy
was ready to explode.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.666
I could feel it coming.

01:08:31.743 --> 01:08:33.210
So, Adele...

01:08:33.278 --> 01:08:35.872
do you like California?

01:08:35.947 --> 01:08:38.313
Oh, yeah. Very much.

01:08:38.383 --> 01:08:41.045
What's your day like,
Adele, back there?

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:42.108
Hal.

01:08:42.187 --> 01:08:43.551
Well, I, uh...

01:08:43.622 --> 01:08:46.648
work a full day at school
with my students.

01:08:46.725 --> 01:08:48.317
And, uh, we live in Beverly Hills,

01:08:48.393 --> 01:08:49.689
so it's quite a commute.

01:08:49.761 --> 01:08:52.252
I have to be in the car
for at least 2 hours.

01:08:52.330 --> 01:08:54.924
Let me tell you something,
Adele, we all work.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:55.932
That wasn't necessary.

01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:56.933
Anyone want another drink?

01:08:57.002 --> 01:08:58.332
Jim.

01:08:58.403 --> 01:08:59.995
Of course you work, Jimmy,

01:09:00.071 --> 01:09:04.064
but you've also got
Mom's house now and the RV.

01:09:04.142 --> 01:09:06.372
Could we not have
any fighting today?

01:09:06.444 --> 01:09:08.537
Your life is not
that difficult, is it?

01:09:08.613 --> 01:09:12.412
Well, maybe if I had
had half the help from the family

01:09:12.484 --> 01:09:14.314
that you were lucky enough
to come into, Jimmy.

01:09:14.386 --> 01:09:15.353
You come here a second with me.

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:16.785
I wanna show you something, Adele.

01:09:16.854 --> 01:09:18.412
You don't have to
talk to her like that.

01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:19.616
I want to show you the deed

01:09:19.691 --> 01:09:20.850
and the mortgage to the house

01:09:20.926 --> 01:09:22.587
that I've been paying on,
that I'm still paying on!

01:09:22.661 --> 01:09:23.593
Damn it, get out of the house.

01:09:23.662 --> 01:09:24.594
You know who helped me

01:09:24.662 --> 01:09:26.596
when I was by myself with a child,

01:09:26.665 --> 01:09:28.359
all by myself?
Nobody.

01:09:28.433 --> 01:09:29.593
Nobody helped me, Jimmy.

01:09:29.667 --> 01:09:31.225
I'm gonna show you the deed.

01:09:31.303 --> 01:09:32.997
You take a look at it.
Either you look at it

01:09:33.071 --> 01:09:34.368
oryou shut your damn mouth
from now on.

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:36.770
Nobody talks to me like that,
Jimmy, not even you.

01:09:36.841 --> 01:09:39.174
Come on, Ted,
take me to the Holiday Inn.

01:09:39.243 --> 01:09:40.609
Make your phone calls there,
too, not here.

01:09:40.679 --> 01:09:42.374
I knowyou need to get laid
back in Beverly Hills,

01:09:42.447 --> 01:09:44.846
but can't you hold off
a little bit-

01:09:45.917 --> 01:09:47.975
Adele. Adele!

01:09:48.053 --> 01:09:50.020
Your sister's boy is dead.

01:09:50.087 --> 01:09:51.282
Please, everyone just stop this.

01:09:51.356 --> 01:09:53.187
God damn it.

01:09:53.258 --> 01:09:55.021
Back off.

01:09:55.093 --> 01:09:56.219
Come on.
We're going.

01:09:56.294 --> 01:09:58.524
Ann.

01:09:58.597 --> 01:09:59.859
We're going!

01:09:59.931 --> 01:10:02.661
You can stay here
if you want, honey.

01:10:02.734 --> 01:10:04.998
I'll make up Benny's bed for you.

01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:07.334
Benny would love that.

01:10:07.405 --> 01:10:10.033
Ann.

01:11:22.681 --> 01:11:24.148
Not again, mother.

01:11:29.254 --> 01:11:30.744
Get me the telephone.

01:11:30.822 --> 01:11:33.916
Get it yourself,
if you even paid the bill.

01:11:35.493 --> 01:11:37.757
Please hand me the phone.

01:11:37.829 --> 01:11:39.558
He doesn't want to talk
to you anymore.

01:11:39.631 --> 01:11:41.064
Don't you get it, mother?

01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:52.142
Aw.

01:11:52.210 --> 01:11:53.802
Jesus Christ.

01:11:56.982 --> 01:11:58.244
Ready?

01:12:13.098 --> 01:12:16.625
You gotta scrape me from the floor

01:12:16.701 --> 01:12:20.137
Everything around me is changing

01:12:23.041 --> 01:12:25.271
Mom? Rise and shine.

01:12:25.343 --> 01:12:26.970
It's time to get up.

01:12:27.045 --> 01:12:29.445
It's 7... 7:40, Mom.

01:12:29.514 --> 01:12:32.176
I have to get to school.
You have to get to work.

01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:33.217
Come on.

01:12:33.284 --> 01:12:34.979
You have to get out of bed, Mom.

01:12:35.053 --> 01:12:36.247
You've been in bed all weekend.

01:12:36.321 --> 01:12:37.583
You can't do this.

01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:41.456
Ok. I'll drive.
I can drive.

01:12:43.728 --> 01:12:45.855
Get your big ass out of bed!

01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:49.627
But isn't this always what I wanted?

01:12:49.701 --> 01:12:52.727
Isn't it just what I always wanted?

01:12:52.804 --> 01:12:53.930
Go away.

01:13:36.081 --> 01:13:37.446
Hey, Adele.

01:13:40.518 --> 01:13:42.918
George, this is your chance!

01:13:42.987 --> 01:13:45.142
Put down the sign and go. Go.

01:13:45.276 --> 01:13:47.335
Go paint a dam somewhere!

01:13:49.580 --> 01:14:04.987
No money, no work!

01:14:11.235 --> 01:14:13.169
Ah, girls.

01:14:13.237 --> 01:14:15.034
- Hi.
- Hi, Miss August.

01:14:15.105 --> 01:14:17.232
Hi.

01:14:17.308 --> 01:14:18.297
You went shopping?

01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:19.842
I thought you had to
picket or something.

01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:21.810
I can't work at that school.

01:14:21.879 --> 01:14:23.403
I resigned.

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.414
I'm a woman of leisure now.

01:14:25.482 --> 01:14:27.143
Let's celebrate.

01:14:27.218 --> 01:14:29.152
You can't quit.
We won't have any money.

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:32.451
Honey, they did not pay me
enough to carry a sign.

01:14:32.523 --> 01:14:35.151
That's why you carry
the sign, isn't it?

01:14:35.226 --> 01:14:38.024
You get more money
if you carry the sign.

01:14:41.198 --> 01:14:42.426
No.

01:14:42.499 --> 01:14:44.763
They carry the sign because...

01:14:44.835 --> 01:14:47.599
they like to struggle.

01:14:47.671 --> 01:14:49.935
Some people need to struggle.

01:14:50.007 --> 01:14:50.974
Struggle, struggle, struggle-

01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:52.065
That's what someone taught them.

01:14:52.142 --> 01:14:53.074
Get out there and struggle-

01:14:53.143 --> 01:14:55.077
That's what somebody said to them.

01:14:55.145 --> 01:14:58.911
But we... did not come
to Beverly Hills to struggle.

01:15:02.486 --> 01:15:04.386
We need to pay the rent.

01:15:04.455 --> 01:15:05.820
Yup, that's true.

01:15:05.889 --> 01:15:07.857
So maybe you're just gonna have
to get a little after-school job

01:15:07.925 --> 01:15:09.222
instead of bringing the gals home

01:15:09.293 --> 01:15:10.920
to do their nails all afternoon.

01:15:10.995 --> 01:15:12.485
We're studying for a French test.

01:15:12.563 --> 01:15:14.053
Oh.

01:15:14.131 --> 01:15:16.395
And you shouldn't have quit your job.

01:15:22.706 --> 01:15:25.869
- I am your mother, am I not?
- I guess so.

01:15:25.943 --> 01:15:28.343
Well... ta mère has something

01:15:28.412 --> 01:15:31.438
she would like to say to you en anglais,

01:15:31.515 --> 01:15:32.573
"Auditions.

01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:36.746
Caucasian, female. 12-16.

01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:39.948
Hostile, withdrawn loner."

01:15:40.024 --> 01:15:41.787
You can handle that,
can't you, baby?

01:15:41.859 --> 01:15:43.690
Why are you doing this?

01:15:43.761 --> 01:15:46.992
You could do a little scene from
Terms of Endearment

01:15:47.064 --> 01:15:48.861
or Clueless!

01:15:48.932 --> 01:15:50.092
Yeah.

01:15:50.167 --> 01:15:52.499
I bet you all could
do a scene from Clueless,

01:15:52.569 --> 01:15:53.797
like totally!

01:15:53.871 --> 01:15:55.202
That would be cool.

01:15:56.707 --> 01:15:58.334
I don't know those scenes.

01:15:58.409 --> 01:15:59.933
I don't want to be an actress.

01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:01.671
I don't know how to act.
I don't know anything.

01:16:01.745 --> 01:16:02.871
I don't know why I'm here

01:16:02.946 --> 01:16:03.970
and neither do you.

01:16:04.048 --> 01:16:05.777
And what would you
have rather done,

01:16:05.849 --> 01:16:07.840
stayed back home
and been one of those little girls

01:16:07.918 --> 01:16:09.647
who sits longer
than the others on the porch

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:13.212
straining to hear the sounds
of the trucks on the highway?

01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:14.780
You're acting crazy again.

01:16:14.858 --> 01:16:15.825
One of those little girls

01:16:15.893 --> 01:16:17.588
who has the names
of cities in her head

01:16:17.661 --> 01:16:19.026
but has never been to one?

01:16:19.096 --> 01:16:21.326
Who dreams of hotels
and has never sat in a lobby?

01:16:21.398 --> 01:16:22.956
Is that what you want?

01:16:23.033 --> 01:16:24.933
Ann, we're gonna go.

01:16:25.002 --> 01:16:25.969
Where are you going?

01:16:26.036 --> 01:16:27.094
I'll see you later, ok?

01:16:27.171 --> 01:16:28.399
I'll call you, Ann.

01:16:28.472 --> 01:16:29.404
Bye, Miss August.

01:16:29.473 --> 01:16:30.701
Call me.

01:16:30.774 --> 01:16:32.241
Ciao.

01:16:39.883 --> 01:16:41.043
All right.

01:16:42.586 --> 01:16:45.248
Where, where is it?
Where do you want me to go?

01:16:45.322 --> 01:16:47.313
All right.

01:16:48.659 --> 01:16:51.287
Circled it for you,
and I can call them for you.

01:16:51.362 --> 01:16:53.592
I'll do it myself.

01:16:53.664 --> 01:16:56.565
They're gonna want you
to do some improv,

01:16:56.633 --> 01:16:59.625
but it should be related
to the material, ok?

01:16:59.703 --> 01:17:00.795
Ok.

01:17:00.871 --> 01:17:01.735
Yes?

01:17:01.805 --> 01:17:02.737
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:17:02.806 --> 01:17:04.740
I'm Heather Ann August's mother.

01:17:04.808 --> 01:17:05.934
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:17:06.009 --> 01:17:07.874
So, um, has she finished her audition?

01:17:07.945 --> 01:17:09.207
Oh, she's in there now.

01:17:09.279 --> 01:17:10.644
- She is?
- Yeah.

01:17:10.714 --> 01:17:12.944
Can I see?
Can I watch her?

01:17:13.016 --> 01:17:14.813
No. We can't interrupt.

01:17:14.885 --> 01:17:16.409
Just a little, tiny bit.

01:17:16.487 --> 01:17:17.613
Uh, excuse me?

01:17:17.688 --> 01:17:20.213
She'd really like
for me to watch.

01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:22.190
I'd rather you didn't.

01:17:22.259 --> 01:17:23.726
- Ok.
- Ok.

01:17:23.794 --> 01:17:24.852
Thanks.

01:17:24.928 --> 01:17:26.418
I need Karen.

01:17:28.665 --> 01:17:29.791
Karen?

01:17:31.001 --> 01:17:31.933
Karen?

01:17:33.871 --> 01:17:35.805
Karen Scarborough?

01:17:36.874 --> 01:17:40.666
Mmm.

01:17:40.744 --> 01:17:42.575
What a man.

01:17:42.646 --> 01:17:45.945
What a meal he made of me

01:17:46.016 --> 01:17:50.077
during that thing
that adults do in bed.

01:17:50.154 --> 01:17:54.784
Not many men know
how to do it, but...

01:17:54.858 --> 01:17:57.088
when they do it...

01:17:57.161 --> 01:17:58.321
it means they...

01:17:58.395 --> 01:18:00.386
really love you.

01:18:01.865 --> 01:18:05.164
They wouldn't just
do it to any woman.

01:18:05.235 --> 01:18:08.398
It means they'll buy you a big house

01:18:08.472 --> 01:18:10.531
with blue shutters and...

01:18:10.607 --> 01:18:12.871
make life easy for you.

01:18:12.943 --> 01:18:17.846
He's going to take us
to the Music Center.

01:18:17.915 --> 01:18:19.439
The opera.

01:18:19.516 --> 01:18:20.778
I love the opera.

01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:30.055
He never returned my call.

01:18:31.295 --> 01:18:34.059
I didn't understand.

01:18:34.131 --> 01:18:36.861
Oh, God, life is so shitty.

01:18:36.934 --> 01:18:39.494
The whole world is so shitty.

01:18:56.019 --> 01:18:57.714
Beverly Hills, what a bummer.

01:19:03.327 --> 01:19:04.453
But...

01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:07.720
so what?

01:19:09.666 --> 01:19:12.829
Like my daddy always used to say...

01:19:12.903 --> 01:19:15.371
Be optimistic

01:19:15.439 --> 01:19:17.566
Don't you be a grumpy

01:19:17.641 --> 01:19:18.835
When the road gets bumpy

01:19:18.909 --> 01:19:21.377
Just smile, smile, smile
and be happy

01:19:21.445 --> 01:19:22.878
Don't wear a long face

01:19:22.946 --> 01:19:25.210
It's never in style

01:19:25.282 --> 01:19:27.750
Be optimistic and smile

01:19:38.996 --> 01:19:42.525
Mom?

01:19:42.599 --> 01:19:45.534
I'm sorry,
but you have to understand

01:19:45.602 --> 01:19:47.001
I was just doing an audition.

01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:50.005
It just came out.
I didn't plan it.

01:19:50.073 --> 01:19:52.667
I didn't do it to hurt
your feelings.

01:20:01.051 --> 01:20:02.746
You weren't supposed to be there.

01:20:02.819 --> 01:20:04.184
I told you not to come.

01:20:07.824 --> 01:20:09.815
I didn't even want
to go to the audition.

01:20:11.995 --> 01:20:14.987
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends.

01:20:17.801 --> 01:20:19.769
I don't know what to say.

01:20:20.837 --> 01:20:22.771
It just-It just happened.

01:20:24.274 --> 01:20:26.538
They wanted me to-

01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:29.511
Nobody would even know it was you.

01:20:36.053 --> 01:20:39.022
I wake up and I don't
even want to be here.

01:20:39.089 --> 01:20:41.057
Who would want to be with you?

01:20:41.124 --> 01:20:43.558
You're just a crazy, middle-aged,

01:20:43.627 --> 01:20:45.390
unemployed school teacher

01:20:45.462 --> 01:20:48.761
with-with a child to support.

01:20:51.335 --> 01:20:53.929
Why can't our lives just be normal?

01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:00.641
You know, I get so scared sometimes

01:21:00.711 --> 01:21:02.679
I want to go find my father.

01:21:07.884 --> 01:21:09.818
You should find your father.

01:21:12.389 --> 01:21:14.482
Maybe he can give you a normal life.

01:21:28.939 --> 01:21:32.431
Hi, Miss Letterfine?
It's Ann August.

01:21:32.509 --> 01:21:34.238
I'm all right.

01:21:34.311 --> 01:21:36.404
Um...

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.243
I'm sorry to disturb you so late,

01:21:38.315 --> 01:21:42.115
but is my mom there?

01:21:44.855 --> 01:21:45.879
Oh.

01:21:47.057 --> 01:21:50.424
No. I...

01:21:50.494 --> 01:21:53.429
Well, she left a little while ago

01:21:53.497 --> 01:21:56.057
and I was just wondering.

01:21:57.567 --> 01:21:58.864
Never mind.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.174
I'm so sorry to bother you.

01:22:06.877 --> 01:22:08.276
All right.

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.411
Bye.

01:22:52.014 --> 01:22:54.244
We didn't speak.

01:22:59.154 --> 01:23:01.679
We've never
spoken about that day.

01:23:09.631 --> 01:23:12.065
Now my mother was trying
to cover up her feelings

01:23:12.134 --> 01:23:13.897
with orange paint.

01:23:21.243 --> 01:23:23.177
I felt so alone.

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:26.972
I miss Grandma.

01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:29.717
I miss Benny.

01:23:32.154 --> 01:23:34.384
I never stop missing Benny.

01:23:46.201 --> 01:23:47.566
Go on. Just call.

01:23:47.636 --> 01:23:48.898
You know you want to.

01:23:48.971 --> 01:23:50.165
You've had his number forever.

01:23:50.238 --> 01:23:52.433
You have a perfect right
to call your own dad.

01:23:52.507 --> 01:23:53.974
I bet he's a really nice person

01:23:54.042 --> 01:23:55.475
and just feels guilty

01:23:55.544 --> 01:23:57.273
and hasn't had the nerve
to contact you.

01:23:57.346 --> 01:23:58.813
Do something.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.814
After all,
he did give you that rabbit's foot

01:24:00.882 --> 01:24:02.440
to remember him by.

01:24:02.517 --> 01:24:03.984
I'll do it.

01:24:04.052 --> 01:24:04.984
No.

01:24:05.053 --> 01:24:06.384
It's ok.

01:24:06.455 --> 01:24:08.548
I'll dial and you talk, ok?

01:24:08.623 --> 01:24:10.557
Ann, just get it over with.

01:24:10.625 --> 01:24:11.592
Don't worry.

01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:13.093
It's gonna be ok.

01:24:14.896 --> 01:24:16.386
I'm sorry.

01:24:17.799 --> 01:24:19.357
It's ringing.
Don't hang up.

01:24:19.434 --> 01:24:21.231
Don't hang up!
Ann!

01:24:21.303 --> 01:24:23.271
Don't hang up.

01:24:26.541 --> 01:24:27.803
Hello?

01:24:30.145 --> 01:24:31.806
Hello?

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.245
Mr. Badir?

01:24:33.315 --> 01:24:35.112
Yes?

01:24:35.183 --> 01:24:39.244
Is this - Is this Hisham Badir?

01:24:39.321 --> 01:24:42.586
Yes. Who is this?

01:24:43.725 --> 01:24:45.317
This is Ann.

01:24:45.394 --> 01:24:48.124
I'm sorry?

01:24:48.196 --> 01:24:50.528
Your daughter Ann.

01:24:54.336 --> 01:24:55.394
Hello?

01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:57.995
Wow. Ann.

01:24:58.073 --> 01:25:01.338
How are you?

01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:05.005
I'm ok.
A little taken by surprise.

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.708
I'd really like to see you.

01:25:07.783 --> 01:25:09.683
Ohh...

01:25:09.751 --> 01:25:11.241
Dad?

01:25:11.319 --> 01:25:13.446
I wasn't exactly ready for this.

01:25:13.522 --> 01:25:15.080
Do you think I could see you?

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:19.893
I heard you were married again.

01:25:19.961 --> 01:25:21.258
Where did you hear that?

01:25:21.329 --> 01:25:26.062
Someone in Bay City
told Uncle Jimmy.

01:25:26.134 --> 01:25:28.830
Do you have any children?

01:25:28.904 --> 01:25:32.897
Yes. A daughter.

01:25:38.046 --> 01:25:39.638
I have a sister?

01:25:42.751 --> 01:25:45.015
What's her name?

01:25:45.087 --> 01:25:46.577
Tamara.

01:25:46.655 --> 01:25:48.987
She's - She's 9.

01:25:53.361 --> 01:25:57.127
So, uh...

01:25:57.199 --> 01:25:59.030
Does Tamara know about me?

01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:03.197
Do you ever think about me?

01:26:03.271 --> 01:26:05.569
Ann...

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.767
do you need me to
help out in some way?

01:26:11.279 --> 01:26:12.576
What?

01:26:12.647 --> 01:26:14.274
Do you need some money?

01:26:16.485 --> 01:26:18.885
That's - That's a terrible thing to say.

01:26:18.954 --> 01:26:22.947
I - I just wanted to talk to you.

01:26:23.024 --> 01:26:26.152
You're my father, and...

01:26:26.228 --> 01:26:28.219
I thought maybe I could see you.

01:26:28.296 --> 01:26:30.287
I thought perhaps
your mother asked you to.

01:26:30.365 --> 01:26:33.232
My mother didn't ask me
to do anything.

01:26:33.301 --> 01:26:34.598
Why would you say that?

01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:37.160
You know your mother.

01:26:37.239 --> 01:26:40.436
Yes, I do know my mother,
and this isn't about your money.

01:26:40.509 --> 01:26:43.808
She has nothing to do with this.

01:26:43.879 --> 01:26:45.710
Ann...

01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:48.214
I don't know what to say.

01:26:48.283 --> 01:26:52.083
Look, I'm in the middle of something.

01:26:52.154 --> 01:26:54.088
- Can I-
- You don't-

01:26:54.156 --> 01:26:57.853
You're not even glad
that I called, are you?

01:26:57.926 --> 01:27:01.020
You don't care if
you ever see me again.

01:27:01.096 --> 01:27:03.394
You don't give a damn
about me, do you?

01:27:03.465 --> 01:27:06.229
Why don't you give me your number?

01:27:06.301 --> 01:27:07.791
I'm sorry I called you.

01:27:07.869 --> 01:27:10.394
Listen, Ann-

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:13.373
You're better off without him.

01:27:13.441 --> 01:27:14.840
Write him off.
Who needs him?

01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:17.504
Sue the bastard for
child support or something.

01:27:34.396 --> 01:27:35.920
Hello?

01:27:39.401 --> 01:27:40.333
Hello?

01:27:40.402 --> 01:27:42.233
Ann?

01:27:42.304 --> 01:27:43.566
Yeah, Peter?

01:27:46.074 --> 01:27:48.838
I want to kiss your lips.

01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:50.207
What for?

01:27:52.714 --> 01:27:54.306
I don't know.

01:27:54.382 --> 01:27:57.215
Well, if you can't think of
a better reason than that...

01:28:10.699 --> 01:28:11.631
What?

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:13.634
I thought of another reason.

01:28:16.338 --> 01:28:19.603
I'm wild about your warm lips

01:28:19.674 --> 01:28:21.608
and I want to squeeze-

01:28:21.676 --> 01:28:24.702
I want to squeeze you tight.

01:28:24.779 --> 01:28:27.077
I want to be one with you.

01:28:27.148 --> 01:28:28.206
Yeah.

01:28:29.618 --> 01:28:33.782
I want to part your lips
with my tongue.

01:28:33.855 --> 01:28:35.880
Yeah, and then what?

01:28:35.957 --> 01:28:37.185
Tell me. Then what?

01:28:39.527 --> 01:28:42.325
I don't know.

01:28:42.397 --> 01:28:44.763
Well, come on over.

01:29:00.081 --> 01:29:01.275
Is your mom home?

01:29:01.349 --> 01:29:02.873
No.

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.246
So...

01:29:09.291 --> 01:29:11.953
Maybe we should go out some night.

01:29:12.027 --> 01:29:13.289
No.

01:29:15.897 --> 01:29:17.956
Come in.

01:29:27.642 --> 01:29:29.075
So, what about that stuff

01:29:29.144 --> 01:29:31.112
you were saying on the phone?

01:29:31.179 --> 01:29:32.646
Where'd you learn that?

01:29:32.714 --> 01:29:34.705
It's just in a book.

01:29:34.783 --> 01:29:37.684
Why don't you take off
your clothes?

01:29:41.289 --> 01:29:42.756
All right. Um...

01:29:45.026 --> 01:29:47.324
Don't you want to talk first?

01:29:47.395 --> 01:29:49.590
It's not even dark outside.

01:29:49.664 --> 01:29:50.722
So?

01:29:56.338 --> 01:29:58.203
Music? Do you want
to put on some music?

01:29:59.407 --> 01:30:00.669
All right.

01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:55.390
Are those initials
on your underwear?

01:30:57.799 --> 01:31:00.199
Yeah. My mom has that done.

01:31:00.268 --> 01:31:02.031
Initial freak.

01:31:03.805 --> 01:31:06.137
Take them off
and bring them to me.

01:31:11.279 --> 01:31:12.871
I want to kiss you.

01:31:15.383 --> 01:31:18.484
Ok.

01:31:39.707 --> 01:31:41.106
Wow.

01:31:57.258 --> 01:31:59.658
That summer I turned 17...

01:32:01.596 --> 01:32:03.564
and I started planning my escape.

01:32:06.234 --> 01:32:08.668
My mother finally found
a job she liked

01:32:08.736 --> 01:32:10.363
at a convalescent home.

01:32:10.438 --> 01:32:12.372
She was good at what she did.

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.429
Here, look at yourself.

01:32:13.508 --> 01:32:16.136
At last she had
a captive audience.

01:32:16.211 --> 01:32:17.974
That was a good one.
Good. Good.

01:32:18.046 --> 01:32:20.674
Waltz.

01:32:20.748 --> 01:32:23.148
And where's that tongue
going on the "I"?

01:32:23.218 --> 01:32:24.150
Waltz.

01:32:24.219 --> 01:32:25.709
It would help if we had

01:32:25.787 --> 01:32:27.254
a little bit snazzier
lipstick here, Jack.

01:32:27.322 --> 01:32:28.812
Ha ha ha!

01:32:28.890 --> 01:32:30.824
Ok, Jack? We gotta get her
some perky lipstick.

01:32:30.892 --> 01:32:33.759
Make that pucker.
Let's try it again.

01:32:33.828 --> 01:32:36.058
"Wuh."

01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:38.325
Waltz.

01:32:39.434 --> 01:32:41.868
I appreciate
how you are with my mother.

01:32:41.936 --> 01:32:43.096
How you are with everybody.

01:32:43.171 --> 01:32:44.900
She's coming along all right.

01:32:44.973 --> 01:32:47.737
I'd like to talk more about this.
After work?

01:32:47.809 --> 01:32:49.777
I could take you out to
lunch or dinner some time?

01:32:49.844 --> 01:32:51.072
Uh, thanks.

01:32:51.145 --> 01:32:52.806
Tell you all about
the carpet business.

01:32:52.881 --> 01:32:53.973
Yeah, sometime.

01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:57.240
Bye, guys.
Bye, Ann.

01:32:57.318 --> 01:32:59.582
Must have bagged
a zillion groceries today.

01:32:59.654 --> 01:33:01.281
You must be so tired.

01:33:01.356 --> 01:33:03.290
I really appreciate
you going with me.

01:33:03.358 --> 01:33:05.417
I just couldn't deal
with it by myself.

01:33:05.493 --> 01:33:07.620
Every time this guy looks
at me and asks me out,

01:33:07.695 --> 01:33:09.663
it's just so sad.

01:33:09.731 --> 01:33:11.961
He's so... nice.

01:33:12.033 --> 01:33:15.264
When my wife died,
I started eating out all the time.

01:33:15.336 --> 01:33:17.361
How was the pot roast?

01:33:17.438 --> 01:33:19.668
Nice. It was nice.

01:33:19.741 --> 01:33:21.470
Think you'll ever
go back to Wisconsin?

01:33:21.543 --> 01:33:24.205
- Not for anything in the world.
- Yeah.

01:33:24.279 --> 01:33:25.940
Well, is it that bad?

01:33:26.014 --> 01:33:28.005
It was a dead end.
That's why we left.

01:33:28.082 --> 01:33:29.515
I sometimes think about

01:33:29.584 --> 01:33:31.814
just picking up and leaving, too.

01:33:31.886 --> 01:33:34.650
Whenever a new shipment
of carpets comes into my store,

01:33:34.722 --> 01:33:37.657
I believe that
somewhere in the pile

01:33:37.725 --> 01:33:39.818
there's one that flies.

01:33:39.894 --> 01:33:42.624
It's been put there for me.

01:33:42.697 --> 01:33:47.066
Some beautifully handwoven
16th century Persian rug

01:33:47.135 --> 01:33:49.194
from A Thousand and One Nights,

01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:50.897
and I sit myself down on it

01:33:50.972 --> 01:33:52.701
and I wave good-bye
to everybody in the store

01:33:52.774 --> 01:33:55.208
and fly right out of the front door.

01:33:55.276 --> 01:33:56.709
When I graduate this year,

01:33:56.778 --> 01:33:58.575
my carpet's gonna fly me
back East to college.

01:33:58.646 --> 01:34:02.013
You better tell your carpet
to drop you at UCLA.

01:34:02.083 --> 01:34:04.176
I'd like to go back East.

01:34:04.252 --> 01:34:05.742
Since when?

01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:08.516
I've been thinking about it.

01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:10.854
Well, independence.
Sounds like her mother.

01:34:10.925 --> 01:34:15.089
She's not going back East.
She's going to UCLA.

01:34:15.163 --> 01:34:16.562
No, I'm not.

01:34:16.631 --> 01:34:19.498
Honey, the hourly wage

01:34:19.567 --> 01:34:21.535
bagging groceries at the supermarket

01:34:21.603 --> 01:34:23.730
is never going to pay
for an eastern college.

01:34:23.805 --> 01:34:26.638
But I'm saving
and I can apply for financial aid

01:34:26.708 --> 01:34:27.675
and Grandma said she'd try to help.

01:34:27.742 --> 01:34:29.369
Your Grandma knows about this?

01:34:29.444 --> 01:34:31.173
She said when the time comes

01:34:31.245 --> 01:34:33.406
maybe she'll be able
to help out a little.

01:34:33.481 --> 01:34:35.449
I'd like to go away to college.

01:34:35.516 --> 01:34:36.448
Why?

01:34:36.517 --> 01:34:37.745
Because I want to get away.

01:34:37.819 --> 01:34:40.151
You wanted to get out
of Bay City, didn't you?

01:34:40.221 --> 01:34:42.052
I want to get out
of Beverly Hills.

01:34:42.123 --> 01:34:43.385
I'm sorry I brought this up.

01:34:43.458 --> 01:34:45.722
You're gonna end up back in Bay City?

01:34:45.793 --> 01:34:46.919
I didn't say that.

01:34:46.995 --> 01:34:48.428
After all this time?

01:34:48.496 --> 01:34:49.963
After all that I've sacrificed?

01:34:50.031 --> 01:34:51.965
Um...

01:34:52.033 --> 01:34:54.558
have you two ever been
down to the grunion run?

01:34:54.636 --> 01:34:58.367
No, Jack.
I have to say we have not been

01:34:58.439 --> 01:35:00.168
to the grunion run.

01:35:00.241 --> 01:35:01.469
What is a grunion?

01:35:01.542 --> 01:35:04.067
It's a little coastal fish.

01:35:04.145 --> 01:35:06.613
It comes up on shore
every once in a while

01:35:06.681 --> 01:35:08.273
during high tide
and lays its eggs in the moonlight.

01:35:08.349 --> 01:35:09.839
And then it dies.

01:35:09.917 --> 01:35:12.351
It's yet another example of a mother

01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.411
giving her life for her child.

01:35:14.489 --> 01:35:16.650
Well, some of them die.
Not all of them.

01:35:16.724 --> 01:35:18.919
Sounds really interesting.
I'd love to see that.

01:35:18.993 --> 01:35:20.551
Well, I'd like to take you.

01:35:20.628 --> 01:35:21.822
Great.

01:35:25.667 --> 01:35:27.157
I like him.

01:35:27.235 --> 01:35:29.703
He gets on my nerves.

01:35:29.771 --> 01:35:32.205
He likes you,
and if he asks you out again,

01:35:32.273 --> 01:35:33.535
I hope you'll go.

01:35:33.608 --> 01:35:35.735
He asked me to go to Las Vegas
for the weekend.

01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:38.574
Good. You should go.
You might have fun.

01:35:38.646 --> 01:35:40.079
He is not my type.

01:35:40.148 --> 01:35:42.048
He's not my idea of fun.

01:35:42.116 --> 01:35:45.279
Go to Vegas, Mom.
Take a chance.

01:35:45.353 --> 01:35:47.287
You don't have to fall
in love with him.

01:35:47.355 --> 01:35:48.652
I'm not asking you
to even sleep with him.

01:35:48.723 --> 01:35:50.520
Oh, thank you.

01:35:50.591 --> 01:35:52.456
You could win the jackpot even.

01:35:52.527 --> 01:35:55.018
All right, I will go to Vegas.

01:35:55.096 --> 01:35:57.064
Fine. Just stop it.

01:35:57.131 --> 01:35:58.792
But you are going to UCLA.

01:35:58.866 --> 01:36:01.391
It's a state school,
it's all that we can afford,

01:36:01.469 --> 01:36:04.461
and I do not want to hear
another word about it.

01:36:10.211 --> 01:36:12.907
"Jackpot."

01:36:14.582 --> 01:36:16.015
My mother didn't know it,

01:36:16.084 --> 01:36:18.712
but I'd already applied to
Brown University in Rhode Island.

01:36:18.786 --> 01:36:22.847
Peter tried to talk me
into going to Berkeley,

01:36:22.924 --> 01:36:25.859
but my heart was set
on the East Coast.

01:36:25.927 --> 01:36:27.360
My grades were really good,

01:36:27.428 --> 01:36:30.261
and I thought I could get
a full scholarship.

01:36:30.331 --> 01:36:32.993
I like the part
about the noble soul,

01:36:33.067 --> 01:36:35.467
but do you really read Nietzsche?

01:36:37.371 --> 01:36:38.804
I mean, I read Nietzsche.

01:36:38.873 --> 01:36:40.306
I don't really read Nietzsche.

01:36:42.243 --> 01:36:44.438
He'd be a crazy friend to have,
don't you think?

01:36:44.512 --> 01:36:46.571
Mm-hmm.

01:36:46.647 --> 01:36:49.081
Besides, I think people
who read Nietzsche,

01:36:49.150 --> 01:36:52.051
like really read Nietzsche,
are kinda...

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:54.588
I don't know.
Kierkegaard, though, he said that-

01:37:34.335 --> 01:37:36.861
Where's the mail?

01:37:36.938 --> 01:37:38.303
Right there.

01:37:41.843 --> 01:37:43.003
You opened it.

01:37:43.077 --> 01:37:44.442
Well, how else am I going to know

01:37:44.512 --> 01:37:46.571
how you're planning your life?

01:37:46.647 --> 01:37:48.945
After all, I'm only your mother.

01:37:49.017 --> 01:37:51.315
Why would you confide in me,
thank you very much.

01:37:51.386 --> 01:37:54.378
Go ahead. Open it.

01:37:54.455 --> 01:37:56.650
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

01:37:59.961 --> 01:38:02.156
Providence, Rhode Island?

01:38:02.230 --> 01:38:05.131
Could you have gotten
any farther away from me?

01:38:07.869 --> 01:38:10.337
Look, I just don't understand.

01:38:10.405 --> 01:38:13.169
After all these years,
after all our hard work,

01:38:13.241 --> 01:38:16.233
would it have killed you
to just stick around a bit

01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:18.141
and show some respect
and appreciation

01:38:18.212 --> 01:38:20.271
to the people that have
worried about you

01:38:20.348 --> 01:38:21.372
and loved you

01:38:21.449 --> 01:38:22.575
and have sacrificed
everything for you?

01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:25.847
I'm not going anywhere!

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:28.081
If you're going to read my mail,
read it carefully.

01:38:28.156 --> 01:38:31.717
They're giving me some money
for tuition and fees,

01:38:31.793 --> 01:38:33.590
but not all of it,
and we have to pay part of it.

01:38:33.661 --> 01:38:36.289
And we don't have that.

01:38:36.364 --> 01:38:40.164
Read it.
"Parents' contributions."

01:38:40.234 --> 01:38:42.600
God, I wanted it so bad.

01:39:03.491 --> 01:39:06.654
Oh, Pooh Bear,
it's not the end of the world.

01:39:06.727 --> 01:39:09.127
It is the end of the world!

01:39:09.197 --> 01:39:11.563
Maybe not for you,
but it is for me.

01:39:21.843 --> 01:39:23.174
We could get an ice cream.

01:39:23.244 --> 01:39:24.541
No!

01:39:24.612 --> 01:39:28.446
Can't you understand?
I want to go away to college.

01:39:28.516 --> 01:39:31.144
I want to be on my own
and you on your own.

01:39:31.219 --> 01:39:33.653
And I know you're scared
to be without me,

01:39:33.721 --> 01:39:35.586
but I can't help that.

01:39:35.656 --> 01:39:38.216
And I feel bad about that,

01:39:38.292 --> 01:39:41.056
but I don't want
that job anymore.

01:39:41.129 --> 01:39:44.394
Let me live my own life.
Let me go.

01:40:13.528 --> 01:40:15.496
Ohh.

01:40:31.779 --> 01:40:32.803
Good afternoon.

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.711
You went through that
stop sign back there.

01:40:34.782 --> 01:40:37.080
I need your driver's license
and registration, please.

01:40:39.086 --> 01:40:41.486
You want to take
the driver's license

01:40:41.556 --> 01:40:43.251
out of this, please?

01:40:43.324 --> 01:40:44.916
Oh, my God.

01:40:44.992 --> 01:40:46.516
What?

01:40:46.594 --> 01:40:50.428
You're the one who ran after
my daughter Ann on Christmas.

01:40:50.498 --> 01:40:53.262
You winked at her?
Do you remember?

01:40:53.334 --> 01:40:55.859
Oh, yeah.
I remember you two.

01:40:55.937 --> 01:40:58.428
I know what you told her,
and she hasn't been the same since.

01:40:58.506 --> 01:40:59.905
I'm sorry.
Can I have the driver's license?

01:40:59.974 --> 01:41:01.498
You might have been right.

01:41:01.576 --> 01:41:04.272
It hasn't been perfect, ok?

01:41:04.345 --> 01:41:05.778
Hey, nobody's perfect.

01:41:05.846 --> 01:41:07.609
Exactly. I make mistakes.
That's what I was saying.

01:41:07.682 --> 01:41:11.345
Sometimes maybe
I'm a little bit selfish.

01:41:11.419 --> 01:41:14.047
Maybe sometimes
I'm a little bit irresponsible,

01:41:14.121 --> 01:41:16.351
and the lights go out sometimes.

01:41:16.424 --> 01:41:18.756
But I'm trying.
That's the point, right?

01:41:18.826 --> 01:41:20.623
I am trying. It's not easy.

01:41:20.695 --> 01:41:22.458
I'm sure it's not easy for her, either.

01:41:22.530 --> 01:41:24.498
If I could get
the driver's license from you?

01:41:24.565 --> 01:41:26.396
I know I should have
helped her find her father,

01:41:26.467 --> 01:41:28.628
but I knew that
he would disappoint her,

01:41:28.703 --> 01:41:29.727
and she's better than that.

01:41:29.804 --> 01:41:31.738
So I tried to find her
another father.

01:41:31.806 --> 01:41:33.330
That's completely impossible.

01:41:33.407 --> 01:41:34.840
I'm sure it's very difficult for you.

01:41:34.909 --> 01:41:37.742
Did she tell you any of
the good things that I did?

01:41:37.812 --> 01:41:39.109
'Cause I did a lot of good things.

01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:40.169
I just need the license-

01:41:40.248 --> 01:41:42.910
She's always had
a warm home, food-

01:41:42.984 --> 01:41:45.214
- Lady-
- clothing-

01:41:45.286 --> 01:41:46.480
Lady-

01:41:46.554 --> 01:41:48.715
The best school system.
Did she tell you that?!

01:41:48.789 --> 01:41:51.349
No, ma'am.
Gimme that license, please.

01:41:51.425 --> 01:41:52.357
All right!

01:41:52.426 --> 01:41:54.223
Thank you.

01:41:55.363 --> 01:41:57.797
You know,
she could have been an actress,

01:41:57.865 --> 01:41:59.924
instead she wants
to go away to college.

01:42:00.001 --> 01:42:01.866
She's telling me that
I have to let her go.

01:42:01.936 --> 01:42:03.699
Well, it's always been
just the two of us,

01:42:03.771 --> 01:42:06.137
and that is very hard.

01:42:06.207 --> 01:42:07.572
I don't get it.

01:42:07.642 --> 01:42:12.477
Doesn't she know
I- I would do anything for her?

01:42:12.546 --> 01:42:14.878
I mean, I love her.

01:42:14.949 --> 01:42:17.577
She is the reason I was born.

01:42:17.652 --> 01:42:20.177
Doesn't she understand
that I would do anything for her?

01:42:25.559 --> 01:42:27.083
Then you know what to do.

01:42:35.369 --> 01:42:36.631
Yeah.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.271
I'll tell you what.

01:42:48.349 --> 01:42:50.112
This is what I'm going to do for you.

01:42:50.184 --> 01:42:51.276
I'm gonna let you go.

01:42:51.352 --> 01:42:52.284
Ok.

01:42:52.353 --> 01:42:54.844
Ok? Here's your driver's license.

01:42:54.922 --> 01:42:56.116
Thanks.

01:42:56.190 --> 01:43:00.217
Watch the signs, please.

01:43:00.294 --> 01:43:01.693
Ok?

01:43:01.762 --> 01:43:03.696
And have a nice day.

01:43:03.764 --> 01:43:05.823
You, too.

01:43:18.312 --> 01:43:21.839
Mmm, it's beautiful.

01:43:21.916 --> 01:43:23.110
It's your color.

01:43:23.184 --> 01:43:24.208
It is, isn't it?

01:43:24.285 --> 01:43:25.843
It makes you look so thin.

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:27.945
Oh, God, well, that's good.

01:43:28.022 --> 01:43:29.683
Call me.

01:43:29.757 --> 01:43:30.689
Oh, honey.

01:43:30.758 --> 01:43:32.225
What are you doing?

01:43:32.293 --> 01:43:34.625
You're home early.
I wanted to surprise you.

01:43:34.695 --> 01:43:36.458
God, this is
a beautiful automobile.

01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:38.293
Janet just bought our car.

01:43:38.366 --> 01:43:39.697
You're selling the car?

01:43:39.767 --> 01:43:41.564
Sold. Ha ha!

01:43:41.635 --> 01:43:43.569
This is my daughter Ann,
you know, going to Brown.

01:43:43.637 --> 01:43:45.867
I was telling her
all about you, sweetie.

01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.669
Yeah. I love this car.

01:43:47.742 --> 01:43:49.334
I was out with
a girlfriend in her car,

01:43:49.410 --> 01:43:50.741
and I see your mom driving past.

01:43:50.811 --> 01:43:52.904
When I saw that "for sale" sign
in the window,

01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:55.744
I am telling you,
I heard a voice in my head saying,

01:43:55.816 --> 01:43:57.716
"You have to have that car."

01:43:57.785 --> 01:43:59.582
I mean, I can't even
really afford it,

01:43:59.653 --> 01:44:02.520
but it's, like,
the car that I see in my dreams.

01:44:02.590 --> 01:44:04.148
Mom, why are you doing this?

01:44:04.225 --> 01:44:05.852
What do you mean
I'm going to Brown?

01:44:05.926 --> 01:44:08.918
Sweetie, we can afford it.

01:44:08.996 --> 01:44:10.429
I worked it out.

01:44:10.498 --> 01:44:11.624
I saved a little money in the bank,

01:44:11.699 --> 01:44:13.098
and now with the money from the car-

01:44:13.167 --> 01:44:14.532
I'm applying to UCLA.

01:44:14.602 --> 01:44:19.301
Sweetheart, UCLA is for
surfers and wanna-be starlets.

01:44:19.373 --> 01:44:21.102
She's a serious student.
Go to Brown.

01:44:21.175 --> 01:44:22.972
You can't sell the car.

01:44:26.213 --> 01:44:28.044
Honey, we're gonna make it work.

01:44:28.115 --> 01:44:29.548
At least for this year.

01:44:29.617 --> 01:44:31.915
We'll worry about next year
next year, right?

01:44:31.986 --> 01:44:33.510
I mean, we're good at that, aren't we?

01:44:33.587 --> 01:44:36.454
Ok. Gonna drive it
away now, girls.

01:44:36.524 --> 01:44:38.424
You can't drive it away.
That's our car.

01:44:38.492 --> 01:44:40.983
That's our Mercedes.
It changed our lives.

01:44:41.061 --> 01:44:42.323
Good luck, Janet!

01:44:42.396 --> 01:44:45.627
Good luck to you, Adele!
Thank you again!

01:45:38.219 --> 01:45:40.119
So I'll come see you at Christmas.

01:45:40.187 --> 01:45:42.587
And in the spring when you come,

01:45:42.656 --> 01:45:45.056
I'll make sure I have
that little house at the beach.

01:45:45.125 --> 01:45:48.617
At the end of Carbon Beach
with the blue roof?

01:45:48.696 --> 01:45:50.186
- Ok.
- Ok.

01:45:50.264 --> 01:45:54.223
You bring - You bring
somebody home with you.

01:45:54.301 --> 01:45:56.235
Somebody that I don't know.

01:45:56.303 --> 01:45:58.203
Somebody that I'll like.

01:45:58.272 --> 01:46:00.502
Ok. I will.

01:46:00.574 --> 01:46:03.475
United Airlines
flight 166 to Boston.

01:46:03.544 --> 01:46:04.568
All passengers...

01:46:04.645 --> 01:46:06.374
I have to go.

01:46:06.447 --> 01:46:08.881
...should now be onboard
at gate 18.

01:46:12.386 --> 01:46:13.944
You look elegant, Mom.

01:46:18.092 --> 01:46:19.684
Oh, look at you.

01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:22.661
Ohh...

01:46:22.730 --> 01:46:26.257
You never were
a small-town girl, honey.

01:46:26.333 --> 01:46:28.528
Thanks for knowing that, Mom.

01:46:33.307 --> 01:46:35.207
And wear your seat belt, ok?

01:46:35.276 --> 01:46:36.368
Mm-hmm.

01:46:40.881 --> 01:46:42.815
Ok. Ok.

01:46:45.219 --> 01:46:47.084
And - And make a list of all the books

01:46:47.154 --> 01:46:48.348
that you're reading
so I can keep up.

01:46:48.422 --> 01:46:49.753
Ok.

01:47:00.234 --> 01:47:02.031
I love you.

01:47:02.102 --> 01:47:05.299
I love you too, sweetie.

01:47:08.242 --> 01:47:09.504
Bye.

01:47:15.616 --> 01:47:17.106
Be optimistic

01:47:20.354 --> 01:47:22.288
Don't you be a grumpy

01:47:22.356 --> 01:47:24.187
When the road gets bumpy

01:47:24.258 --> 01:47:26.249
Just smile, smile, smile

01:47:26.327 --> 01:47:27.760
Be happy

01:47:47.381 --> 01:47:49.508
Go! Go ahead!

01:47:59.159 --> 01:48:01.593
Even if you can't stand her,

01:48:01.662 --> 01:48:04.096
even if you hate her,

01:48:04.164 --> 01:48:06.098
even if she's ruining your life,

01:48:06.166 --> 01:48:09.693
there's - there's
something about my mother.

01:48:09.770 --> 01:48:11.965
Some romance...

01:48:12.039 --> 01:48:13.438
some power.

01:48:15.843 --> 01:48:18.311
And when she dies...

01:48:18.379 --> 01:48:20.745
the world will be flat.

01:48:20.814 --> 01:48:25.114
Too simple, too fair...

01:48:25.185 --> 01:48:26.482
too reasonable.

01:48:26.553 --> 01:48:28.521
Ooh! Gosh, you pack
quite a wallop.

01:48:28.589 --> 01:48:30.147
Oh, excuse me.

01:48:30.224 --> 01:48:31.648
Are you ok?

01:48:31.725 --> 01:48:33.454
I'm fine. Thanks.

01:48:33.527 --> 01:48:37.054
Free to find where I belong

01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:42.598
Free to find myway

01:48:45.472 --> 01:48:48.737
I know at times
I act a little crazy

01:48:49.977 --> 01:48:54.311
And I made mistakes along the way

01:48:54.381 --> 01:48:56.975
But I can see the silver lining

01:48:57.051 --> 01:48:58.882
It's about to bring a change

01:48:58.952 --> 01:49:01.978
I have been waiting for

01:49:02.056 --> 01:49:04.047
Yeah

01:49:04.124 --> 01:49:07.787
'Cause I'm free

01:49:07.861 --> 01:49:11.888
Free to find where I belong

01:49:14.201 --> 01:49:16.795
Free to find my way

01:49:18.438 --> 01:49:21.839
I want to be free

01:50:05.686 --> 01:50:08.985
Sometimes

01:50:09.056 --> 01:50:11.490
Time comes along

01:50:11.558 --> 01:50:15.153
When it's time to

01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:17.823
Time to move on

01:50:17.898 --> 01:50:20.992
You can't stay there

01:50:21.068 --> 01:50:24.663
No matter how much you want

01:50:24.738 --> 01:50:27.366
Tears flow

01:50:27.441 --> 01:50:29.636
Sad words are said

01:50:29.710 --> 01:50:33.305
But in my heart

01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:36.975
The story won't end

01:50:37.050 --> 01:50:39.883
You'll still be there

01:50:39.953 --> 01:50:43.912
In everything that I do

01:50:43.991 --> 01:50:48.553
And wherever I go

01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:53.066
I'll remember you

01:50:53.133 --> 01:51:00.539
Leaving's not leaving

01:51:00.607 --> 01:51:05.203
'Cause I'm not leaving you behind

01:51:05.279 --> 01:51:09.773
You'll always be with me

01:51:09.850 --> 01:51:12.751
Always be with me

01:51:12.819 --> 01:51:15.583
And part of my heart

01:51:15.656 --> 01:51:18.454
For all time

01:51:18.525 --> 01:51:21.653
Where I'm going

01:51:21.728 --> 01:51:25.164
You're going

01:51:25.232 --> 01:51:31.535
Even if it's just in my mind

01:51:31.605 --> 01:51:33.869
Leaving's not leaving

01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:40.402
I'm not leaving you behind

01:51:43.116 --> 01:51:46.279
Moments

01:51:46.353 --> 01:51:48.583
Share them with you

01:51:48.655 --> 01:51:52.182
They're the best times

01:51:52.259 --> 01:51:55.990
That I ever knew

01:51:56.063 --> 01:51:59.294
They'll still be there

01:51:59.366 --> 01:52:03.530
When good-byes are all through

01:52:03.603 --> 01:52:07.596
I'll remember those days

01:52:07.674 --> 01:52:12.134
I'll remember you

01:52:12.212 --> 01:52:19.675
Leaving's not leaving

01:52:19.753 --> 01:52:24.190
'Cause I'm not leaving you behind

01:52:24.257 --> 01:52:28.717
You'll always be with me

01:52:28.795 --> 01:52:31.593
Always be with me

01:52:31.665 --> 01:52:34.532
Part of my heart

01:52:34.601 --> 01:52:37.195
For all time

01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:40.433
Where I'm going

01:52:40.507 --> 01:52:43.874
You're going

01:52:43.944 --> 01:52:50.372
Even if it's just in my mind

01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:52.782
Leaving's not leaving

01:52:52.853 --> 01:52:54.787
I'm not leaving

01:52:54.855 --> 01:53:00.555
You behind

01:53:00.627 --> 01:53:09.399
Leaving's not leaving

01:53:12.406 --> 01:53:17.141
Not leaving you behind

01:53:17.210 --> 01:53:19.440
I'm not leaving you

01:53:19.513 --> 01:53:23.347
I'm not leaving you behind

01:53:23.417 --> 01:53:26.443
No, no, no

01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:27.919
I'm not leaving

01:53:30.123 --> 01:53:32.887
Leaving's not leaving

01:53:32.959 --> 01:53:34.517
I'm not leaving you

01:53:34.594 --> 01:53:37.722
I'm not leaving

01:53:37.798 --> 01:53:41.666
You behind
