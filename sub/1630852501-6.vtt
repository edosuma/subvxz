WEBVTT

00:06.047 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:10.010 --> 00:11.720
<i>I did everything you asked.</i>

00:11.803 --> 00:14.973
I stopped Jana from ruining Sebas,
and this is how you thank me?

00:15.473 --> 00:17.100
<i>You don't understand, Luka.</i>

00:17.183 --> 00:18.435
Explain it, then.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.396
<i>The Nonames thought</i>
<i>they had the perfect platform</i>,

00:21.479 --> 00:24.107
<i>but they're one step away</i>
<i>from the edge of the cliff.</i>

00:24.607 --> 00:26.526
<i>They just need a little push.</i>

00:27.110 --> 00:29.029
This Bond villain voice is killing me.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.197
They have to go down in public.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.615
In front of everyone.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.035
<i>We trust you, Luka.</i>

00:35.952 --> 00:37.078
Send it.

00:51.342 --> 00:54.345
I bet he won't do it.
He doesn't have the balls.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.932
Calm down, Sebastián,
and for once, listen to me.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.392
I always listen to you.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.145
Like when I told you
not to go to the party?

01:02.729 --> 01:04.898
Mr. "I-get-drunk-and-spill-everything"?

01:04.981 --> 01:05.815
Enough.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.445
You know what's worse than being a sheep?

01:10.528 --> 01:12.405
What? Tell me.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.158
Being a sheep who thinks he's a wolf.

01:39.682 --> 01:42.268
Dude, it's getting late. Let's go!

01:49.109 --> 01:50.985
<i>He's a fucking cynic, I hate him.</i>

01:51.486 --> 01:55.406
If I weren't so hungover, I'd beat him up.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.992
What matters is he confessed.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.954
We can talk to Celina.
We can tell her everything.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.748
It's Sebas' word against ours.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.668
He's untouchable.
He'll blame someone else.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.337
So, it was all for nothing.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.382
Sebas doesn't want us in the final round.
There's only one choice.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.051
What? Kick his ass?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.219
No, Andi.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.512
Win fair and square.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.180
Good plan.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.684
Did you see that in a movie,
or was it your idea?

02:23.518 --> 02:25.061
Where were you, Luka?

02:25.145 --> 02:27.063
Sleeping. It's Saturday.

02:28.022 --> 02:29.399
This is disrespectful,

02:29.482 --> 02:31.401
having an assembly so early.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.778
No, Luka. I mean, at the party.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.197
You disappeared all of a sudden.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.742
Jani, what do you think?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.953
That you're the only people I see?

02:42.453 --> 02:43.580
I have a social life.

02:45.039 --> 02:46.708
Are you alive, Selenita?

02:48.042 --> 02:49.460
I don't know how I got here.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.546
I think I lost all my cards.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.506
Your dignity too.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.593
So, what was that perfect plan of yours?

02:56.676 --> 02:58.136
Dude, it's simple.

02:58.219 --> 03:01.848
We have to kill it in the semi-final
and again at the final.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.101
It's the only way.

03:06.060 --> 03:06.895
Okay.

03:08.771 --> 03:09.772
Esteban.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.650
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

03:12.734 --> 03:16.613
It's just… I'm really hungover.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.364
You're such a grandpa.

03:21.242 --> 03:23.286
TEMPORARILY LOCK CARDS

03:23.369 --> 03:25.038
LOCK CARD

03:27.957 --> 03:29.751
-MJ.
-See you inside, okay?

03:29.834 --> 03:30.668
Yeah.

03:32.754 --> 03:36.007
I wanted to apologize
for putting you in that position.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.343
I agreed to be part of it.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.595
Well, yeah, but we both know

03:40.678 --> 03:42.889
I would've found a way to convince you…

03:42.972 --> 03:45.975
It's not like we do everything
because you say so.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.268
I didn't mean that.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.230
I just wanted to apologize,
and I'm glad nothing happened.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.731
How's the headache, girls?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.986
Come on, we wouldn't want you to miss out.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.658
You too. Let's go.

04:11.793 --> 04:12.961
Good morning, everyone.

04:13.628 --> 04:14.837
How excited are we?

04:18.216 --> 04:19.634
Ready for semi-finals?

04:20.677 --> 04:22.762
I said, are you ready?

04:23.346 --> 04:24.222
Yes.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.519
After this phase, we'll have two bands

04:29.602 --> 04:30.853
for the final.

04:31.437 --> 04:34.440
You'll have to make a music video,
but listen,

04:34.524 --> 04:36.693
it won't be just any music video.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.780
You'll have to shoot
a video of a cover of RBD.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.407
Goddamn it.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.449
No.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.784
I know every song.

04:44.867 --> 04:48.079
It can't be. What about my street cred?

04:48.162 --> 04:51.708
Your street cred died
when you came to this school. God.

04:51.791 --> 04:55.628
Time starts when you receive
your text with the rules

04:55.712 --> 04:58.631
and the song you'll cover. Are you ready?

05:02.260 --> 05:03.553
Thanks.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.013
I know this song.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.597
-Do you like it?
-Amazing.

05:07.098 --> 05:07.932
I love it.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.767
-Don't tell me we got…
-"Save Me"!

05:09.851 --> 05:10.935
Which one is that?

05:11.019 --> 05:12.687
God, Dixon, it's an anthem.

05:12.770 --> 05:13.604
A meme.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.107
The only thing that song's good for.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.400
You have no heart.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.361
Yes, I do. Mine just has taste.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.103
-Where's my mom?
-Again? I told you I don't know.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.689
Stop playing dumb
and tell me where she is.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.649
You're like a broken record.

05:59.400 --> 06:03.029
Look, I was going to give you a chance
to tell me everything on your own,

06:03.112 --> 06:05.114
but that's clearly not working.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.535
So I'll have to go to Celina
and tell her you sent me to get beaten up.

06:09.619 --> 06:10.745
You're such a pain.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.622
Your mom was my music teacher.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.375
-What? Do you know where she is?
-No.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.335
You'll find out in due time.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.545
What do you mean?

06:19.629 --> 06:20.922
I don't know anything.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.298
I told you, my mom…

06:22.382 --> 06:24.717
Leave the romance for later.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.095
Time is ticking.
The video won't film itself.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.479
Three of us are a gang,
that come from over here.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.315
The rest of us are another gang

06:39.399 --> 06:41.359
that come in from this side.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.443
And we clash.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.736
Okay.

06:43.820 --> 06:47.365
Lights. We could play
a lot with the lights.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.741
Let's make up a dance.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.618
And it turns into a fight.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.578
And that fight is…

06:52.662 --> 06:55.581
…all in swimsuits, to keep it fair.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.625
We obviously need hats, I think.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.794
Does it snow in Mexico?

07:00.628 --> 07:03.256
The swimsuit idea, MJ…

07:03.339 --> 07:04.674
Black and white?

07:04.757 --> 07:06.384
Have you seen <i>The Warriors?</i>

07:07.343 --> 07:09.303
I like your ideas, but…

07:11.264 --> 07:14.475
Maybe something more emotional,
that sends a message.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.978
That's the climax and pow!

07:17.854 --> 07:18.771
"Save me!"

07:19.313 --> 07:20.898
What are we being saved from?

07:21.399 --> 07:24.569
Okay. This is officially
our worst brainstorming session.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.112
We've wasted hours…

07:26.195 --> 07:27.989
Do you have a better idea?

07:29.323 --> 07:30.533
Of course I do.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.203
-But do whatever you want, guys.
-Then keep quiet.

07:35.705 --> 07:39.333
I was thinking
we could be a bit more honest.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.294
We could talk about who we are.

07:41.878 --> 07:46.215
A video that shows us with no filters,
masks, or fear of being ourselves.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.509
I think that's the only way we'll win.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.638
Jana is the only one
who's shot a video here.

07:53.890 --> 07:54.765
Count me in.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.185
Me too.

07:58.561 --> 07:59.395
Okay.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.813
I'm in too.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.358
Let's do what the director says.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.987
Perfect. Let's get to it, then.

08:10.072 --> 08:11.824
We could use the wall…

08:17.788 --> 08:19.373
We're all set.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.833
-Okay.
Jana.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.419
I, um…

08:23.503 --> 08:27.715
I wanted to ask,
since you'll be directing and everything,

08:27.798 --> 08:31.219
what do you think if I sing "Save Me"?

08:31.302 --> 08:34.263
-It's one of my favorites.
-What if we both sing?

08:34.347 --> 08:37.642
Girls, please, stop arguing.
Can you hurry up? Okay, Jana.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.101
Put those on.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.145
We're not arguing.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.650
<i>Missing you…</i>

08:45.733 --> 08:47.151
-Again?
-Yep.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.491
<i>Missing you is my need</i>…

08:53.574 --> 08:55.576
Jana, with feeling.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.953
Feel the words.

08:57.036 --> 09:00.331
You're not feeling anything.
Selena, can you show her?

09:01.666 --> 09:02.667
Okay.

09:03.793 --> 09:07.171
<i>Missing you is my need</i>

09:08.005 --> 09:09.549
Okay. I got it.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.967
-Sure? Okay.
-Take three.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.139
<i>Missing you is my need</i>

09:17.223 --> 09:19.934
<i>I live in despair</i>

09:20.017 --> 09:24.480
<i>Since you left for good</i>

09:25.481 --> 09:28.234
<i>I survive on pure anxiety</i>

09:28.734 --> 09:31.279
<i>With a knot in my throat</i>

09:31.362 --> 09:35.575
<i>I can't stop thinking of you</i>

09:36.993 --> 09:39.662
<i>Little by little, the heart</i>

09:40.162 --> 09:42.415
<i>Loses its faith</i>

09:43.332 --> 09:44.750
<i>Loses its voice</i>

09:44.834 --> 09:48.713
<i>A one-way ticket</i>

09:48.796 --> 09:50.339
<i>And a suitcase</i>

09:50.423 --> 09:52.675
<i>Full of dreams</i>

09:52.758 --> 09:56.637
<i>A farewell to my parents</i>

09:56.721 --> 09:59.932
<i>A lot of fear and will to live</i>

10:00.016 --> 10:02.893
<i>So, it is what it is</i>

10:03.769 --> 10:06.814
<i>There's nothing to do about it</i>

10:06.897 --> 10:10.484
<i>It is what it is</i>

10:10.568 --> 10:14.447
<i>That's how it happens</i>

10:14.530 --> 10:16.032
<i>This love</i>

10:16.115 --> 10:20.077
<i>Just tell me it's not true</i>

10:20.161 --> 10:23.164
<i>Just stay quiet</i>

10:23.247 --> 10:25.458
<i>For five minutes</i>

10:25.541 --> 10:28.544
<i>Caress me for a moment</i>

10:28.628 --> 10:30.796
<i>Come closer to me</i>

10:30.880 --> 10:33.674
<i>I'll give you one last kiss</i>

10:33.758 --> 10:36.052
<i>The deepest of all</i>

10:36.135 --> 10:38.554
<i>I'll keep my feelings inside</i>

10:38.638 --> 10:41.557
<i>And go far away from you</i>

10:41.641 --> 10:43.643
<i>Save me from oblivion</i>

10:43.726 --> 10:46.562
<i>Save me from the darkness</i>

10:46.646 --> 10:49.482
<i>Save me from boredom</i>

10:49.565 --> 10:56.530
<i>Never let me fall</i>

11:06.916 --> 11:08.793
This is going to sound great.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.045
Let's take a break. There's a lot to do.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.756
-I need to shower.
-Thank you.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.341
Good job.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.051
Can you help me with the set?

11:17.551 --> 11:20.471
I'd love to, but I have to finish the mix.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.848
-I'll meet you there.
-Sure.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.648
So, what do you know?

11:30.731 --> 11:32.608
Wait. Can I say something?

11:33.192 --> 11:34.402
But don't get cocky.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.196
I like the paranoid side of you.

11:37.279 --> 11:41.367
The mysterious guy from the first day,
always looking down. It didn't work.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.953
Now let's get to business.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.540
My dad worked with your mom

11:47.623 --> 11:49.166
before she was my teacher.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.002
-I need to talk to him.
-Wait.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.422
I can get you information on your mom,

11:54.505 --> 11:56.799
but I need you to do me a favor.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.096
I just sent you something.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.059
Luka, what the hell is this?

12:10.187 --> 12:13.190
-MJ, have you checked your Instagram?
-What?

12:14.859 --> 12:16.986
Dude, you have a ton of fans.

12:17.069 --> 12:20.072
I think we all did well, as a band.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.615
You were really great.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.908
<i>MJ!</i>

12:22.992 --> 12:25.327
People love you.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.831
You have haters too. Look.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.040
What do you mean?

12:30.124 --> 12:32.418
It means you made it.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.880
Who's water emoji, fire emoji?

12:35.963 --> 12:37.173
Oh, it's no one.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.842
You know what? I have to go help Jana.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.177
I'll see you later.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.309
Do you like the song now?

12:48.392 --> 12:51.562
Well, I guess it's not the worst song.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.063
So, I'll go help Jana.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.525
Bye, see you there.

12:58.944 --> 12:59.904
Right.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.983
What are you doing?

13:38.692 --> 13:39.527
Nothing.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.946
Wow, you look beautiful.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.617
No, I'm serious.

13:47.409 --> 13:48.953
Why are you so beautiful?

13:50.454 --> 13:52.498
How am I supposed to answer that?

13:54.875 --> 13:57.002
Sebas, do you want them to catch us?

14:01.257 --> 14:02.466
What if they do?

14:03.175 --> 14:04.260
"What if they do?"

14:05.845 --> 14:08.597
Chill. Everyone's
either filming or sleeping.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.225
We could have sex outside
and no one would know.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.394
You say that because you're untouchable.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.731
No one can mess with
the son of Mexico's future president.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.568
If you want, you can touch me.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.653
Sebas, I'm serious.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.239
So am I. You're with me,

14:25.322 --> 14:27.616
and you're with The Lodge. You're fine.

14:28.158 --> 14:32.371
I just make phone calls.
No one takes me seriously. Neither do you.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.291
I get no say…

14:38.043 --> 14:38.878
at all.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.174
I don't make the rules.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.930
Come on, cheer up. You're with me.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.600
It's going to be okay.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.997
-Were Sebas and I about to--
-Nothing happened.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.917
Nothing happened and that's what matters.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.962
I would've taken your place.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.882
-In the hot tub with Sebas?
-No.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.051
Of course not.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.553
I mean, I would've gotten him drunk

15:29.637 --> 15:31.430
instead of putting you at risk.

15:32.389 --> 15:33.223
Listen.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.395
If anything happened to you…

15:40.397 --> 15:41.899
I don't know what I'd do.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.694
-What?
-Someone's there.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.242
What? Do you have to get back?

15:52.326 --> 15:54.495
Fucking Sebas isn't answering me.

15:54.578 --> 15:57.247
We have to finish recording the video.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.540
I'm gonna call him.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.792
Come on.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.835
What?

16:01.919 --> 16:03.170
Forget him.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.588
You could join my band.

16:05.881 --> 16:09.051
-Yeah, we have a Colombian.
-Yeah.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.387
An American.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.265
A superstar. A guy from Puebla.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.643
We just need a Brazilian.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.019
Sounds like a joke.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.772
So your plan is to destroy my band?

16:21.855 --> 16:24.817
No, it's to make mine better.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.277
Yeah.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.039
I knew it.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.629
They know how to make
good use of their time.

16:54.847 --> 16:55.681
It's Jana.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.519
They've been at the set for hours.
We have to go.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.072
Hey, how are we doing?

17:16.076 --> 17:18.203
Dude, I'm so excited.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.165
We're going to win.
Sebas is going to be pissed.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.252
What?

17:28.005 --> 17:29.214
Something's wrong.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.384
Don't say you're hungover.
We both know it's not that.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.011
Is it about being official?

17:34.636 --> 17:38.557
If it made you uncomfortable,
just say so. It doesn't matter.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.142
Not at all.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.561
It's the only good thing I have right now.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.522
Are you sure?

17:53.155 --> 17:54.907
Okay, Ms. Director.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.033
The camera's ready.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.534
Let's do it!

18:01.872 --> 18:02.831
Ready?

18:04.833 --> 18:05.918
Action!

18:12.091 --> 18:14.384
SAVE ME

18:18.305 --> 18:21.016
<i>Missing you is my need</i>

18:21.517 --> 18:24.019
<i>I live in despair</i>

18:24.103 --> 18:28.315
<i>Since you left for good</i>

18:29.525 --> 18:32.361
<i>I survive on pure anxiety</i>

18:32.945 --> 18:35.280
<i>With a knot in my throat</i>

18:35.364 --> 18:39.660
<i>I can't stop thinking of you</i>

18:41.120 --> 18:43.914
<i>Little by little, the heart</i>

18:44.498 --> 18:46.542
<i>Loses faith</i>

18:47.376 --> 18:50.879
<i>Loses its voice</i>

18:50.963 --> 18:54.049

18:54.133 --> 18:56.718
<i>Save me from loneliness</i>

18:56.802 --> 18:59.680

18:59.763 --> 19:02.516

19:02.599 --> 19:05.185
<i>Save me from oblivion</i>

19:05.269 --> 19:07.771
<i>Save me from darkness</i>

19:08.355 --> 19:10.983
<i>Save me from boredom</i>

19:11.066 --> 19:16.155
<i>Never let me fall</i>

19:26.790 --> 19:29.501
<i>I tell myself to move on</i>

19:30.002 --> 19:32.421
<i>But love is a word</i>

19:32.504 --> 19:36.592
<i>I find hard to forget</i>

19:38.135 --> 19:41.221
<i>I survive on pure anxiety</i>

19:41.305 --> 19:43.891
<i>With a knot in my throat</i>

19:43.974 --> 19:48.228
<i>I can't stop thinking of you</i>

19:49.688 --> 19:52.733
<i>Little by little, the heart</i>

19:52.816 --> 19:55.861
<i>Loses faith</i>

19:55.944 --> 19:59.531
<i>Loses its voice</i>

20:02.492 --> 20:04.995

20:08.207 --> 20:11.460

20:11.543 --> 20:13.587
<i>Save me from oblivion</i>

20:13.670 --> 20:16.590
<i>Save me from darkness</i>

20:16.673 --> 20:19.218
<i>Save me from boredom</i>

20:19.801 --> 20:23.305
<i>Never let me fall</i>

20:23.388 --> 20:25.390
<i>Save me from oblivion</i>

20:25.474 --> 20:28.101
<i>Save me from darkness</i>

20:28.185 --> 20:31.480
<i>Save me from boredom</i>

20:31.563 --> 20:34.149
<i>I am shaped to your will</i>

20:34.233 --> 20:36.985
<i>Save me from oblivion</i>

20:37.069 --> 20:39.404
<i>Save me from darkness</i>

20:39.488 --> 20:42.658

20:42.741 --> 20:45.369

20:45.452 --> 20:48.538
<i>Save me from oblivion</i>

20:53.919 --> 20:57.339
SAVE ME

20:58.924 --> 21:00.092
That was…

21:00.175 --> 21:01.343
-Wow.
-Amazing.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.761
-Incredible.
-So good.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.346
-Amazing.
-Super cool.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.640
Can I sit there? Thanks.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.893
So, if everyone agrees,

21:09.977 --> 21:11.228
should we upload it?

21:11.311 --> 21:12.604
I'm already on it.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.023
You guys can go get some rest.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.149
-You sure?
-Yes.

21:16.775 --> 21:17.776
Let's go.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.363
Dude, great job.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.753
We're gonna kill it.

21:36.837 --> 21:37.671
That's right.

21:38.171 --> 21:40.215
-It's so good.
-I know.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.768
-Luka, this affects you too.
-And?

21:52.352 --> 21:54.271
Go on, do it.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.856
You can't do this, Luka.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.525
I'm not doing anything. You are.

21:59.443 --> 22:02.237
Dude, I know you care
about the band, okay?

22:02.738 --> 22:05.824
Tell whoever is
making you do this to fuck off.

22:05.907 --> 22:06.742
I'll help you.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.661
One of the few things my dad taught me

22:09.745 --> 22:12.622
is to not let emotions
keep you from your goals.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.709
If you want to know more
about your mom, do it.

22:25.969 --> 22:29.348
SELECT FILES TO UPLOAD

22:34.144 --> 22:35.103
Tell me everything.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.163
What is it, Luka?

22:53.246 --> 22:54.956
What happened to Rocío?

22:55.040 --> 22:55.874
<i>What?</i>

22:55.957 --> 22:58.585
Rocío, my music teacher.

22:58.668 --> 23:02.047
Luka, I don't have time
for dumb questions.

23:02.130 --> 23:04.508
You better answer. I won't stop calling.

23:06.551 --> 23:07.719
Is she dead?

23:08.512 --> 23:09.346
<i>Dead?</i>

23:09.930 --> 23:11.890
Please! Who do you think I am?

23:13.225 --> 23:14.726
So, tell me what happened.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.103
<i>How would I know?</i>

23:16.812 --> 23:19.314
<i>You're the all-powerful Marcelo Colucci.</i>

23:20.148 --> 23:21.733
<i>You must know about Rocío…</i>

23:22.317 --> 23:23.485
-García.
-García.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.653
García?

23:25.529 --> 23:27.489
Your teacher's name was Rocío Esquivel.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.951
<i>Why are you so goddamn obsessed with her?</i>

23:31.451 --> 23:32.285
No reason.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.621
I want to take piano lessons.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.581
That's ridiculous, Luka.

23:36.665 --> 23:40.419
Well, thanks for your help, Dad.
Thanks for always being there.

23:40.502 --> 23:41.503
<i>Luka!</i>

23:42.212 --> 23:44.131
Don't bother me with this again.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.681
ROCÍO ESQUIVEL
JAZZ NIGHTS

23:52.764 --> 23:54.015
She's here, man.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.643
She's been here all along.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.858
<i>Hi, son. How are you?</i>

24:03.733 --> 24:04.776
<i>Everything okay?</i>

24:04.860 --> 24:05.819
I found her.

24:06.778 --> 24:07.654
<i>What?</i>

24:08.196 --> 24:09.197
<i>Who?</i>

24:14.453 --> 24:15.454
<i>Esteban?</i>

24:16.121 --> 24:17.122
My mom.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.039
<i>What?</i>

24:20.041 --> 24:21.042
<i>Where are you?</i>

24:32.637 --> 24:35.307
<i>I find you still awake</i>

24:35.390 --> 24:37.517
<i>You say you're sorry</i>

24:37.601 --> 24:43.148
<i>While you shed a tear</i>

24:43.231 --> 24:45.442
<i>You hug me, I freeze up</i>

24:45.525 --> 24:48.403
<i>You ask me for a kiss</i>

24:48.487 --> 24:52.699
<i>And I lose my breath</i>

24:53.617 --> 24:58.246
<i>Just wait a minute</i>

24:58.830 --> 25:03.251
<i>Just tell me it's not true</i>

25:03.335 --> 25:05.754
<i>Just stay silent</i>

25:05.837 --> 25:08.298
<i>For five minutes</i>

25:08.381 --> 25:10.842
<i>Caress me for a moment</i>

25:10.926 --> 25:13.428
<i>Come closer to me</i>

25:13.512 --> 25:16.640
<i>I'll give you one last kiss</i>

25:16.723 --> 25:17.807
<i>The deepest of all</i>…

25:17.891 --> 25:20.560
I want to puke.
I'm not even hungover anymore.

25:21.978 --> 25:24.147
What the hell is this?

25:33.156 --> 25:34.491
Where's Esteban?

25:34.574 --> 25:35.450
I don't know.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.244
I thought he was here.

25:37.327 --> 25:41.540
<i>Far away from you</i>

25:49.005 --> 25:50.590
And that was XY.

25:50.674 --> 25:53.009
Thank you, Emilia and Sebas,

25:53.093 --> 25:56.346
for your very personalized take
on that song.

25:56.930 --> 26:00.392
Now let's see the last video
before choosing the two bands

26:00.475 --> 26:01.685
for the final.

26:02.435 --> 26:04.062
Directed by Jana Cohen,

26:04.145 --> 26:06.106
this is The Nonames.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.149
This is their version
of the classic "Save Me."

26:08.733 --> 26:10.443
Give it up for them.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.544
What happened?

26:28.128 --> 26:29.212
What is this?

26:30.880 --> 26:32.173
Where's our video?

26:32.757 --> 26:33.800
No way.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.511
<i>I live in despair</i>…

26:38.597 --> 26:39.431
That's hot.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.644
Stop, stop.

26:44.728 --> 26:45.812
Stop the video.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.785
They're messing with us again.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.710
Someone explain what the hell is going on.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.421
Celina.

27:11.921 --> 27:15.592
Celina, that's not our video.
I don't know what happened.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.177
-Celina.
-Hey, perverts.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.220
-Shut up, asshole.
-Calm down.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.263
Enough.

27:20.347 --> 27:22.098
That wasn't our video.

27:22.182 --> 27:25.060
We worked really hard.
We would never do that.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.313
It was you.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.607
-It was you, wasn't it?
-No!

27:30.690 --> 27:32.609
-What did you do?
-You're crazy.

27:32.692 --> 27:34.986
-It was you all this time.
-What?

27:35.070 --> 27:37.030
-You're a liar!
-Okay!

27:37.113 --> 27:40.700
I want all of you in my office. Now!

27:40.784 --> 27:41.868
Understood?

27:50.919 --> 27:52.379
That was not the plan.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.380
You're sick.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.925
Now you know I'm a wolf.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.732
Where did Esteban go?

28:12.816 --> 28:14.984
Since you're so clever, you tell me.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.238
This happened an hour after

28:18.738 --> 28:21.074
he uploaded the porn video
from his account.

28:21.157 --> 28:23.410
That wasn't our video.
We didn't upload it.

28:23.493 --> 28:27.122
No, it was the garden gnomes
with their tiny cameras.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.749
But it happened to be
from Esteban's account.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.543
And as far as I know,

28:32.085 --> 28:33.545
Esteban is in your band.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.880
I'd love to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

28:36.506 --> 28:39.551
But I've made
enough exceptions with you guys.

28:40.343 --> 28:41.302
Haven't I?

28:43.054 --> 28:43.972
I'm sorry.

28:44.055 --> 28:45.932
With a situation like this,

28:46.015 --> 28:47.892
I can't make any exceptions.

28:49.686 --> 28:50.937
You're disqualified.
