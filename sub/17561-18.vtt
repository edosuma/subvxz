escaped convicts.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.036

Val, sweetie, I brought you
that tea you asked for.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.462
- I didn't ask for any tea--
- Just drink it and act casual!

00:45.545 --> 00:47.422
I figured out a way how to
break us out of this joint.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.591

00:52.552 --> 00:54.471
the SWAT guys
away from the side door?

00:54.554 --> 00:56.681
Oh, honey, I can
get them to move away

00:56.765 --> 00:59.225
from the door
and buy me a Cadillac .

01:01.060 --> 01:02.520
- Alright, Val, you ready to go?
- Yeah.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.147
Holly, I don't think
this is such a good idea.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.399

letting anybody in or out
