00:02.383 --> 00:04.183
Dr. Zimmerman. Miss Freelander.

00:05.223 --> 00:06.123
Call me Ravi.

00:06.373 --> 00:07.873
A man was found shot dead in???

00:08.122 --> 00:09.923
He had the mark of Kali on his left leg.

00:10.173 --> 00:12.773
It's an ancient cult
dating back 5,000 years.

00:12.848 --> 00:15.248
It's followers were rumored
to foretell disasters.

00:16.111 --> 00:19.011
The makri is an incredibly rare
species of abnormal spider

00:19.025 --> 00:22.025
that requires a warm
blooded host to survive.

00:22.275 --> 00:25.575
It is a sub-species off shoot
of a marine dwelling abnormal

00:25.626 --> 00:27.626
known as

00:28.070 --> 00:30.860
Big Bertha, the one who
makes the earth move...

00:30.864 --> 00:32.264
and the waters rise

00:32.340 --> 00:35.140
They may well have a chemical
or even psychic bond

00:35.178 --> 00:37.778
that allows the host a deeper
connection to big Bertha.

00:37.891 --> 00:40.991
Wait. But big Bertha is dead.
You killed her 4 years ago, yes?

00:41.068 --> 00:42.568
Not exactly.

00:42.580 --> 00:43.433
Terrance.

00:43.439 --> 00:46.300
You have my complete support, Helen.
You always have.

00:46.305 --> 00:48.305
But people are questioning
your judgment.

00:48.555 --> 00:50.055
<i>If anyone finds this makri</i>

00:50.305 --> 00:51.805
<i>They could potentially use it</i>

00:52.055 --> 00:53.555
<i>to locate the most powerful abnormal</i>

00:53.805 --> 00:55.305
<i>- on Earth.
- Kali.</i>

00:55.555 --> 00:57.055
That's the woman of my visions.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.031
Dr. Will Zimmerman.

01:00.345 --> 01:03.526
You're the last surviving member
of the cult to Kali.

I'm putting his blood sample
into the system now!

02:03.201 --> 02:05.443
- Come on!
- Come on, Will!

02:05.468 --> 02:07.417
It's going to be okay.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.655
Pulmocardiac tach.
Help me hold him!

02:09.690 --> 02:11.809
Will, it's Helen!
Can you hear me?

02:11.930 --> 02:14.653
Kali...
She's out there!

02:14.688 --> 02:17.120
God, what the hell
did they do to you?

02:17.121 --> 02:18.784
Let me go!

02:18.859 --> 02:20.577
He's in shock.

02:23.136 --> 02:25.988
- Dr. Magnus...
- Oh, my god.

02:26.023 --> 02:28.843
- What is it?
- His organs are going into systemic failure.

02:28.878 --> 02:31.417
His system's been flooded
with toxic antibodies.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.641
- Turn him!
- What? He's been poisoned?

02:33.676 --> 02:35.904
No, the makri, it must have
been removed by force.

02:35.939 --> 02:37.220
It would have
released these toxins.

02:37.255 --> 02:39.368
But I thought the hosts
can't survive without it.

02:39.403 --> 02:41.064
They can't!

02:41.099 --> 02:43.140
Will!

Season 2 Episode 13

03:21.556 --> 03:23.704
Hey...

03:27.076 --> 03:28.984
God, he looks terrible.

03:29.019 --> 03:31.633
Unfortunately, the makri's absence
from his nervous system

03:31.668 --> 03:34.235
is causing a hypersensitive
immune response.

03:35.013 --> 03:36.648
I've stabilized him for now,

03:36.748 --> 03:38.383
reduced the fevers,
prevented more seizures.

03:38.559 --> 03:40.867
We're running tests.

03:40.953 --> 03:43.016
I know of a few treatments
that could slow his decline,

03:43.051 --> 03:45.579
but we simply don't know
enough about the makri

03:45.614 --> 03:48.083
or its effect
on his physiology.

03:49.083 --> 03:50.619
Any sign of Bertha?

03:50.654 --> 03:52.907
All our resources are being
diverted to the search,

03:52.942 --> 03:54.256
but it'll take time.

03:54.291 --> 03:56.393
She could be thousands
of miles away by now.

03:56.428 --> 03:58.705
Hey, don't beat
yourself up about it.

03:58.740 --> 04:00.885
You did what you had to do.

04:01.117 --> 04:02.842
I wish it were that simple.

04:02.877 --> 04:04.568
The truth is, I broke the rule

04:04.569 --> 04:06.645
that I myself set into place.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.503
I knew it would come back
and haunt me sooner or later.

04:08.538 --> 04:11.823
No, doc, there is
a psychic link to a parasite

04:11.858 --> 04:13.355
and an ancient cult.

04:13.390 --> 04:16.029
Abnormals all over the world
are acting crazy.

04:16.065 --> 04:18.034
I would say that your hunch
about Bertha being connected

04:18.069 --> 04:19.998
to the eco-system
is on the money.

04:20.033 --> 04:21.892
She could destroy
millions of lives.

04:21.927 --> 04:24.324
And by killing her, she could
destroy millions of lives,

04:24.359 --> 04:26.675
so what kind of choice is that?

04:26.803 --> 04:29.470
Look, it happened...

04:29.974 --> 04:33.035
So we improvise, we fix it.

04:33.991 --> 04:36.832
What else can I do?

04:37.864 --> 04:40.037
Find out if Henry's made it
to the lead search ship.

04:40.462 --> 04:42.596
Patch him through
when he's ready.

04:42.597 --> 04:44.580
Done.

05:00.790 --> 05:02.977
Bertha's magnetic burst
definitely caused

05:03.012 --> 05:04.424
a spike in weirdness.

05:04.459 --> 05:07.452
I've adjusted our navigation
systems to compensate.

05:07.487 --> 05:10.010
Also, Declan's reporting
more incidents

05:10.045 --> 05:11.572
of abnormals
appearing in public,

05:11.607 --> 05:14.707
- stirring things up.
- Yes, I've been getting messages

05:14.742 --> 05:16.598
from heads of sanctuaries
all over the world.

05:16.633 --> 05:18.270
Things are only getting worse.

05:18.305 --> 05:19.873
Hey, doc, listen, about Bertha.

05:19.908 --> 05:21.480
I'm really sorry
I wasn't there to help.

05:21.515 --> 05:23.625
You were in the air, Henry.
There's nothing you could've done.

05:23.660 --> 05:26.095
Yeah...
Okay, so we lost round one.

05:26.130 --> 05:27.770
What's our next move?

05:27.805 --> 05:29.172
We need to re-establish contact

05:29.173 --> 05:30.623
with Bertha's tracking device.

05:30.658 --> 05:33.687
Yeah, bad guys have got her
under some sort of a jamming cloak.

05:33.722 --> 05:35.414
None of my scans
are picking anything up.

05:35.449 --> 05:36.843
Who the hell
could've done this?

05:36.878 --> 05:39.541
Someone with major connections
in the abnormal world.

05:39.576 --> 05:41.313
It's far more than that.
This is someone

05:41.348 --> 05:44.594
who has put together pieces of information
that are thousands of years old-

05:44.629 --> 05:47.468
The cult of Kali, the makri,
its connection to Bertha.

05:47.503 --> 05:50.017
Who everybody
believed was dead.

05:50.052 --> 05:53.357
Yeah, you know, this whole cult thing,
I mean, that's got to be, like, biblical old, huh?

05:53.392 --> 05:54.556
Older, in fact.

05:54.591 --> 05:57.072
There are legends of abnormals
who were movers of earth,

05:57.107 --> 05:58.364
heralds of the great floods,

05:58.399 --> 06:00.610
the whisperers
who could talk to all creatures.

06:00.645 --> 06:03.646
All these predate even the earliest
Egyptian dynasties.

06:03.681 --> 06:06.612
Someone studied this
as though it were all fact, not myth,

06:06.647 --> 06:09.874
and now they have control of the most
dangerous abnormal on earth.

06:10.479 --> 06:14.218
I want to know who we're dealing with
and where they've taken her.

06:14.253 --> 06:17.125
Get us back in the game, Henry.

07:15.882 --> 07:18.548

07:18.583 --> 07:21.214
Kali?

07:40.489 --> 07:42.966
Kali?

07:44.725 --> 07:48.012
Durga, find me.

07:49.460 --> 07:52.201
Kali?

07:53.015 --> 07:56.035
Come to me.

08:04.325 --> 08:07.151
Ravi, I need
two milligrams lorazepam!

08:07.152 --> 08:10.701
Hold him still,
or he'll lose the IV!

08:12.202 --> 08:15.646
Help me!
Help me find her!

08:18.331 --> 08:21.127
Will, talk to me.

08:21.162 --> 08:23.924
Help me find her...

09:13.308 --> 09:15.119
Dammit...

09:15.997 --> 09:19.140
You can't see her, can you?

09:20.415 --> 09:22.351
- Who?
- Kali.

09:22.818 --> 09:25.120
You can't see her.

09:28.790 --> 09:32.848
Bhagavad Gita the herald will see her
as a beautiful enchantress

09:32.883 --> 09:34.943
when the connection is strong,

09:35.130 --> 09:37.743
"with color so vibrant
so as to blind a man."

09:37.778 --> 09:39.061
It does say that.

09:39.096 --> 09:42.916
So why am I seeing nothing
when I'm connected to Bertha?

09:44.281 --> 09:45.617
Come on.

09:47.456 --> 09:50.276
I brought you here
as my tech support,

09:50.311 --> 09:53.091
and it's my first time
as a herald.

09:55.408 --> 09:57.662
I'm not going
to get nasty with you...

09:59.070 --> 10:01.363
But he might.

10:04.011 --> 10:09.282
Kali only comes to the mind's eye
when the makri wills it so.

10:09.380 --> 10:12.797
You are not its chosen host.

10:13.288 --> 10:15.432
You will never see her mind
inside yours.

10:15.467 --> 10:18.692
So I don't get fries
with my happy meal.

10:19.177 --> 10:22.191
You're not a herald,
and you never will be.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.712
Oh, really?

10:26.395 --> 10:28.123
That's funny, because
I thought I was the one

10:28.158 --> 10:32.416
who made her crawl 200 miles
across the ocean floor.

10:33.244 --> 10:35.201
I'm the one
with the critter inside of me.

10:35.236 --> 10:37.122
I think Bertha will do
whatever I want.

10:37.157 --> 10:38.950
Such as?

10:38.985 --> 10:41.746
What do the ancient texts
foretell?

10:43.612 --> 10:47.272
The great flood will come
and sweep away sins.

10:48.013 --> 10:51.206
The earth
swallowing up our unclean.

10:51.241 --> 10:54.479
Every single holy man has
predicted Bertha's awakening

10:54.514 --> 10:57.383
since the beginning of time,
and guess what?

11:00.404 --> 11:02.227
They're right.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.932
They're right.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.617
Bibi...

11:08.347 --> 11:10.865
It's the end of days.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.183
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

11:39.634 --> 11:42.064
- Ah... Do not do that.
- Do what?

11:42.099 --> 11:43.469
Follow me like that.

11:43.504 --> 11:45.793
You're looking for the ones
who hurt the white man.

11:45.873 --> 11:49.204
- The ones who took my bibi.
- You saw them?

11:49.609 --> 11:52.466
The, uh... The white guy
is pretty sick right now.

11:52.501 --> 11:55.085
Sick?
But he has a makri inside him.

11:55.846 --> 11:57.542
Not anymore.

11:58.412 --> 12:00.413
That's very bad.

12:00.561 --> 12:02.310
Dr. Magnus?

12:02.950 --> 12:05.253
- Have you heard from Henry?
- Still trying to steal back satellites

12:05.288 --> 12:07.077
to pick up Bertha's trail.

12:07.112 --> 12:09.880
He's going through every ship in the
area at the time she escaped.

12:09.915 --> 12:12.024
So far all their
stories check out.

12:12.059 --> 12:14.463
He's looking for false
registries, shell companies...

12:14.498 --> 12:17.576
It's all taking too long. Bertha's
been gone more than 12 hours now.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.367
Someone has control of her.

12:19.402 --> 12:22.560
Declan's reporting more abnormals
worldwide wreaking havoc.

12:22.595 --> 12:25.570
Controlling the spin on that
many sightings, not easy.

12:25.605 --> 12:27.099
And Will, I mean...

12:27.134 --> 12:29.844
He's speaking more hindi now
than english when he talks.

12:29.988 --> 12:31.720
He keeps calling out for Kali.

12:31.755 --> 12:34.946
Quite possibly a side effect
of having the makri forcibly removed.

12:34.981 --> 12:37.561
It isn't.
This is Arjuna.

12:37.596 --> 12:41.025
He says he's a member of the cult.
Tell them what you told me.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.660
Your friend is still
connected to Kali.

12:43.798 --> 12:47.643
- Are you certain?
- If he still sees her in his dreams,

12:47.678 --> 12:50.942
they can speak.
Kali's an apsara.

12:51.012 --> 12:52.908
A sea spirit.

12:53.090 --> 12:54.437
Bertha?

12:54.472 --> 12:56.420
Once the makri
chooses its host,

12:56.455 --> 12:59.570
that bond can't be undone,
even when the makri is gone.

12:59.605 --> 13:02.148
Can he sense
this apsara, control it?

13:02.183 --> 13:05.075
- Not without the makri to help him.
- He's helpless.

13:05.110 --> 13:07.821
Unless they call her
in a <i>rapati sungu.</i>

13:08.177 --> 13:11.375
- <i>Rapati sungu?</i>
- He must dance for her.

13:11.410 --> 13:12.768
Dance for her?

13:12.803 --> 13:15.137
If he dances a song for her,
she will hear him.

13:15.172 --> 13:17.911
If he dances well, she will listen
to whatever he says.

13:17.946 --> 13:20.088
- Are you sure about this?
- Of course.

13:20.123 --> 13:21.708
I am to be a host
when I am older.

13:21.743 --> 13:24.209
I've been traing
since I was very young.

13:27.677 --> 13:29.675
Infirmary, go ahead.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.109
You have a visitor.

13:34.610 --> 13:36.337
You took Bertha
to the woods to kill her,

13:36.372 --> 13:38.078
and you never
pulled the trigger.

13:38.113 --> 13:41.067
- The optics on that are...
- Oh, to hell with the optics, Terrance.

13:41.703 --> 13:43.251
It was my choice
not to kill her.

13:43.286 --> 13:45.522
If I thought it would be popular,
I wouldn't have kept it secret.

13:45.557 --> 13:48.384
Well, the only problem
with lying is getting caught.

13:51.109 --> 13:54.396
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that 80...

13:54.431 --> 13:58.358
50 years ago, even, no one
would have challenged you on this,

13:58.537 --> 14:00.713
but things have changed.

14:00.748 --> 14:02.715
Helen, I'm sure you did
what you thought was best,

14:02.750 --> 14:04.461
and at the time,
it probably was, but now...

14:04.496 --> 14:06.616
I couldn't have known
about the makri,

14:06.651 --> 14:09.538
or that someone would have figured out
a way to control Bertha remotely.

14:09.573 --> 14:11.423
And I know you took
every precaution,

14:11.458 --> 14:13.485
but it still happened.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.839
Look, this isn't even
about credibility.

14:16.193 --> 14:18.691
It's becoming about trust.

14:20.132 --> 14:22.237
You need to contain
this situation quickly.

14:22.272 --> 14:24.642
We need to find whoever's
controlling Bertha

14:24.677 --> 14:26.472
and sever the connection.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.783
Once I get her back
into containment again, then I...

14:28.818 --> 14:30.358
Containment?

14:30.394 --> 14:33.905
Helen, Bertha is a threat to every
living creature on this planet,

14:33.940 --> 14:35.491
and you want to put her
back in her box?

14:35.526 --> 14:39.061
This issue is far larger than you
could possibly understand.

14:39.096 --> 14:41.571
Killing her is a last resort.

14:41.606 --> 14:44.224
The other heads of house agree.
It would be far too reckless.

14:44.259 --> 14:49.665
Yes, some feel that way,
but not all...

14:50.673 --> 14:53.172
And Helen, the tides
are turning.

14:53.668 --> 14:56.168
We've known each other
for a long time,

14:56.667 --> 14:59.488
and I owe you everything...

15:01.089 --> 15:03.722
But you need to rethink
your stand on this.

15:04.703 --> 15:07.730
You're on thinner ice
than you realize.

15:11.183 --> 15:14.824
There were about 18 ships
in the vicinity when Bertha was taken.

15:14.859 --> 15:16.704
Now, at first blush,
most of them check out.

15:16.739 --> 15:20.487
You got oil tankers,
cargo ships, fishing trawlers.

15:20.522 --> 15:22.469
No connective tissue
between any of them.

15:22.504 --> 15:24.807
But you found something.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.125
- Yeah.
- Hi!

15:26.160 --> 15:29.188
Yeah, I hacked into the databases
of a few fortune 500 companies,

15:29.223 --> 15:31.637
and I cross-referenced
their boards of directors.

15:31.672 --> 15:33.569
You know, those guys
make a whole bunch of money

15:33.604 --> 15:35.635
for doing pretty much nothing?

15:36.193 --> 15:37.386
And?

15:37.421 --> 15:41.934
And, well, one of the guys sits on the board
of every company that had ships in the region

15:41.969 --> 15:44.052
where Bertha was hijacked.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.413
Here you go.
This is edward Forsythe.

15:47.448 --> 15:50.553
Now, he's a big player in the global
geo-mining biz, okay.

15:50.588 --> 15:52.759
This guy owns
half of the oil rigs

15:52.794 --> 15:56.474
in the gulf of mexico and
the north sea oil project, all right?

15:56.509 --> 16:00.381
And he was in Mumbai
when all this went down.

16:00.747 --> 16:02.378
I've met him before.

16:02.413 --> 16:04.101
He approached me
at a conference years ago,

16:04.136 --> 16:07.794
asked all sorts of questions
about abnormals in ancient mythology.

16:07.829 --> 16:09.640
Oh, sorry.

16:09.827 --> 16:12.014
It's a bit rough in here.

16:12.757 --> 16:15.632
So I don't know
how he knows what he knows,

16:15.923 --> 16:17.363
yet,

16:17.398 --> 16:19.121
but he did buy a lot of
ancient artifacts

16:19.156 --> 16:21.776
from museums
over the last few years

16:21.811 --> 16:24.358
- for, like, insane amounts of money.
- What kind of artifacts?

16:24.393 --> 16:26.058
Totems, scrolls, ancient texts.

16:26.093 --> 16:27.824
It's all shroud-of-turin
indiana-jones stuff.

16:27.859 --> 16:29.529
He believes every abnormal
can be traced

16:29.564 --> 16:31.440
to a certain region of pangea,

16:31.475 --> 16:33.778
going back, like,
millions of years.

16:33.813 --> 16:35.315
The original
super-continent?

16:35.350 --> 16:37.134
That's an interesting theory,
but there's no proof.

16:37.169 --> 16:39.207
So what does a billionaire
art collector want

16:39.242 --> 16:40.720
with an earthquake monster?

16:40.755 --> 16:43.664
Well, controlling Bertha's
like having the ultimate nuke.

16:43.699 --> 16:46.207
I mean, he could be using her
to leverage oil rights

16:46.242 --> 16:49.820
anywhere in the world.
Political blackmail for business contracts.

16:50.880 --> 16:54.059
Any coastal city is in jeopardy
if he lets her loose.

16:54.281 --> 16:57.061
No. That's a lot of risk
for a little gain.

16:57.096 --> 16:59.756
I mean, the guy definitely
doesn't need the money.

16:59.791 --> 17:02.441
Then what on earth is he up to?

17:05.730 --> 17:09.638
You think they're onto me,
Magnus and her crew?

17:10.207 --> 17:12.569
Yeah, I think they're onto me.

17:13.465 --> 17:14.993
Not that it matters.

17:15.029 --> 17:17.038
They have no idea
what I'm up to.

17:17.249 --> 17:19.218
They're probably digging up
the auction sale

17:19.252 --> 17:21.930
from the canopic jar of shtabi
from the London museum.

17:22.525 --> 17:24.962
They should've bought it
from a numbered company.

17:27.405 --> 17:30.088
We're never going to be pals,
are we?

17:30.514 --> 17:32.444
You're afraid.

17:33.061 --> 17:35.188
You should be.

17:36.445 --> 17:38.482
Sorry about the delay, sir.

17:38.737 --> 17:41.375
Bertha's proximity is playing havoc
with our navigation.

17:41.410 --> 17:43.519
Yeah, well, we were about
to start swapping puke stories.

17:43.554 --> 17:44.993
What's new?

17:45.028 --> 17:48.827
She's made good progress, sir.
She's at the designated coordinates now.

17:49.010 --> 17:51.072
So we're ready for phase two?
Collateral damage?

17:51.107 --> 17:54.808
We anticipate major seismic activities
associated with her actions.

17:54.843 --> 17:57.026
Coastal areas
will be hit very hard.

17:57.061 --> 17:59.078
That's a damn shame.

18:00.503 --> 18:02.572
- Let's get it started.
- Right.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.782
Come on, girl,
let's go to work.

18:34.118 --> 18:36.112
Where have you been?

18:52.890 --> 18:54.648
Come.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.602
You have been looking for me?

19:30.835 --> 19:34.207
That depends
if this is real or not.

19:34.886 --> 19:36.989
I am real, Durga.

19:37.687 --> 19:39.486
As real as you.

19:41.001 --> 19:43.043
Why do you call me that?

19:43.081 --> 19:44.662
Durga.

19:45.561 --> 19:47.880
It is your name.

19:48.371 --> 19:52.022
Don't tell me you have
forgotten mine as well?

19:52.975 --> 19:54.605
Kali.

19:59.033 --> 20:02.004
You should have not
disappeared like that.

20:02.865 --> 20:04.843
Where did you go?

20:05.167 --> 20:07.675
The thing that connects us
was taken from me.

20:07.758 --> 20:09.460
The makri?

20:10.046 --> 20:12.270
And you allowed this?

20:12.956 --> 20:15.182
I didn't have
much of a choice...

20:15.982 --> 20:19.210
But the other one
that you're connected to

20:19.934 --> 20:22.449
is not your herald.

20:23.311 --> 20:25.236
He calls me.

20:25.797 --> 20:27.316
No...

20:27.993 --> 20:31.167
Kali, you need to stay.
Don't listen to him.

20:31.544 --> 20:33.548
I must go, Durga.

20:34.121 --> 20:36.084
- I can't stay.
- No...

20:36.119 --> 20:37.550
No, wait.

20:37.585 --> 20:39.817
If you are my true herald,

20:40.295 --> 20:42.612
- find me.
- How?

20:42.926 --> 20:46.184
Dance the <i>rapati sungu.</i>

20:49.243 --> 20:50.960
Dance?

20:51.195 --> 20:54.010
And you will find me.

21:18.857 --> 21:20.627
I should have taken
more precautions.

21:20.662 --> 21:23.075
His state of mind's
been deteriorating lately.

21:23.110 --> 21:25.941
I've contacted the local authorities,
given his description.

21:26.258 --> 21:28.191
I'm sure they'll be a big help.

21:28.226 --> 21:31.636
You'd think a white guy wandering the street
screaming about Kali would get noticed.

21:31.671 --> 21:33.394
Not really.
It's Mumbai.

21:33.429 --> 21:36.006
I want all abnormals with psychic
and remote-viewing abilities

21:36.041 --> 21:37.436
activated as well.

21:37.471 --> 21:39.121
If will's mind
is still linked to Bertha,

21:39.156 --> 21:41.418
there may be a way to track him
using unconventional means.

21:41.453 --> 21:43.101
On it.

21:43.541 --> 21:46.124
- Helen...
- Not now, Terrance.

21:46.159 --> 21:48.272
We need to get on a ship,
lead the search for Bertha,

21:48.307 --> 21:50.442
- and end this.
- The search is ongoing.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.531
Finding will
is just as important.

21:52.566 --> 21:55.089
His link to Bertha
may well be the key.

21:55.124 --> 21:57.347
I need five minutes.

21:57.714 --> 22:00.314
- Take over. I'll be right back.
- Got it.

22:00.349 --> 22:02.519
Come with me.

22:13.402 --> 22:15.007
Namaste.

22:18.392 --> 22:20.311
Are you sure?

22:25.413 --> 22:27.498
Are you sure?
Look at it.

22:28.593 --> 22:30.490
No? Okay.

22:33.656 --> 22:35.062
Hey, buddy.

22:36.277 --> 22:38.625
Thanks for nothing.

22:46.646 --> 22:48.324
Come on...

22:52.366 --> 22:55.722
Oh, god... These people are really,
really unhelpful.

22:55.757 --> 22:58.159
No wonder we have no idea
where he's gone.

22:58.194 --> 23:00.077
You're not really
indian, are you?

23:00.112 --> 23:03.430
Excuse me? Dude...

23:03.571 --> 23:05.483
Yeah, but you didn't
grow up here, that's for sure.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.267
- So?
- So you have no idea

23:07.302 --> 23:09.037
how to talk to these people.

23:09.072 --> 23:12.051
They want to help us.
You're just not asking properly.

23:12.086 --> 23:15.593
What, am I supposed to offer them money?
'cause I have tried that. It doesn't work.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.298
Kate, it's entirely
inappropriate

23:17.333 --> 23:19.745
to offer money to someone
in their own home.

23:19.780 --> 23:22.715
You need to show
politeness, gratitude.

23:22.934 --> 23:25.605
Would it kill you a cup of tea with them,
for god's sake?

23:28.864 --> 23:31.319
- They don't like you.
- Stop being rude, and they will help us.

23:31.354 --> 23:33.424
I know all that.

23:33.608 --> 23:36.277
It's just that I've never
bought into that whole...

23:36.531 --> 23:40.661
Quiet, subservient
indian girl thing.

23:41.025 --> 23:43.539
Man, you have some serious
hangups about your roots.

23:43.574 --> 23:45.026
This is the 21st century.

23:45.061 --> 23:46.755
You don't have to be
a servant or a maid,

23:46.790 --> 23:48.444
you just have to show
some respect.

23:48.479 --> 23:51.564
You can be likeable, even attractive,
when you let your guard down.

23:51.599 --> 23:53.532
Try that.

23:54.506 --> 23:57.328
Did you... Just make a pass
at me?

23:57.935 --> 24:01.893
Warming up to it, not that my parents
would approve of you, of course.

24:02.892 --> 24:05.479
I'm joking.
They'd love you.

24:05.514 --> 24:07.210
Really?

24:07.245 --> 24:09.318
No.

24:11.522 --> 24:13.283
I know will is tied into this,

24:13.318 --> 24:15.861
but you're only going to
dig yourself a bigger hole

24:15.896 --> 24:17.761
by taking your eyes
off of Bertha.

24:17.796 --> 24:19.719
Believe me, this is
the right strategy.

24:19.754 --> 24:21.479
- No, it isn't.
- You are way out of line.

24:21.514 --> 24:23.964
You need to shift
your focus on this right now.

24:24.372 --> 24:27.972
Lying about not euthanizing
an extinction-level abnormal

24:28.007 --> 24:31.374
would've gotten any other
head of house suspended,

24:31.874 --> 24:34.742
but because it's you, they're trying
to give you the benefit of the doubt.

24:34.777 --> 24:37.069
- Which they should.
- For how long?

24:37.398 --> 24:40.866
And now with this Forsythe character
who can control her by remote,

24:40.901 --> 24:42.910
what would you say if the
shoe were on the other foot?

24:42.945 --> 24:45.245
There are extenuating
circumstances.

24:45.758 --> 24:48.539
We don't know enough yet
about her connection to the earth.

24:48.574 --> 24:51.950
You don't destroy something that powerful
without having all the facts.

24:51.985 --> 24:54.568
The fact is, she can destroy
half of europe

24:54.603 --> 24:58.021
when she's upset!
You've taken us to the brink, Helen.

24:58.056 --> 25:00.232
How did you think
the network would respond?

25:01.212 --> 25:03.384
You taught us
to think like this.

25:03.526 --> 25:06.134
You said,
"question everything."

25:10.170 --> 25:13.445
They're giving you 72 hours
to contain the situation.

25:21.955 --> 25:23.535
It's Henry.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.831
Doc!
Geosynchronous satellites

25:25.866 --> 25:27.622
detected major
magnetic disturbances

25:27.657 --> 25:30.727
about four minutes ago.
I'm sending you the data now.

25:30.762 --> 25:33.378
Look, based on the resonance pattern,
this has got to be Bertha.

25:33.413 --> 25:35.656
Re-direct all search teams
to the coordinates immediately.

25:35.691 --> 25:37.753
Yeah, we're closing in now,
and I know your next question.

25:37.788 --> 25:39.290
Why would Forsythe
send Bertha there?

25:39.325 --> 25:41.253
- Tectonic plates.
- Because the tecton...

25:41.377 --> 25:43.217
- Yeah... Right.
- It's a convergence point

25:43.252 --> 25:45.675
of three major tectonic boundaries
in the southern hemisphere...

25:45.710 --> 25:48.156
The indian, african
and arabian plates.

25:48.798 --> 25:51.603
Dear god,
he's going to set her off.

25:56.325 --> 25:58.579
No change since
the recent burst.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.184
- Nothing?
- No activity, sir.

26:01.219 --> 26:04.297
She's just sitting there.

26:13.425 --> 26:15.510
You're not strong enough.

26:15.719 --> 26:18.257
You're not worthy
of carrying the makri...

26:19.046 --> 26:21.415
And Kali knows it.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.918
Really?

26:24.394 --> 26:26.434
Watch this.

26:29.768 --> 26:32.257
Fire the little spider up.

26:36.374 --> 26:38.365
Magnetic resonance burst,

26:38.400 --> 26:41.030
half power,
just to get things started.

26:54.884 --> 26:56.731
- Mr. Forsythe...
- Shut up and do it.

27:22.348 --> 27:25.273
Seismic readings coming from
Bertha's position.

27:25.445 --> 27:27.765
She's active. It's starting.

27:29.078 --> 27:31.701
Like I said, end of days.

27:55.215 --> 27:56.679
No!

27:57.195 --> 27:59.404
I've got your long-range
chopper at shivaji airport

27:59.439 --> 28:02.090
prepped and ready to go.
Should get you out here within six hours.

28:02.125 --> 28:03.445
Good.
Is the weapon ready?

28:03.480 --> 28:05.620
Yeah, one vlf Bertha stunner,
ready to go.

28:05.655 --> 28:08.524
You get close enough, the acoustic bullet
should put her back to sleep.

28:08.559 --> 28:11.064
- Just, the problem is...
- We have to get close enough.

28:11.099 --> 28:12.493
- Yeah.
- All right.

28:12.528 --> 28:14.736
- I'll get there as soon as I can.
- Okay, fly safe.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.862
You're using a long-range
acoustic device against Bertha?

28:18.897 --> 28:20.437
With a clear shot,
we could knock her out.

28:20.472 --> 28:22.765
Forsythe can't control
an unconscious creature.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.575
What if it doesn't work?
You need an alternative.

28:24.610 --> 28:26.931
- I'm hoping it won't come to that.
- There's too much at stake, Helen.

28:26.966 --> 28:30.450
I agree, and if there is absolutely
no alternative,

28:30.485 --> 28:33.096
then I will destroy her.

29:05.988 --> 29:07.649
Suddenly such
a delicate flower.

29:07.666 --> 29:10.325
- Oh, bite me.
- It's actually quite breathtaking.

29:12.265 --> 29:15.474
We'll monitor you from here!
Maintain radio contact!

29:15.650 --> 29:17.765
Do nothing unless I order it!

29:17.800 --> 29:19.510
Of course.

29:26.155 --> 29:27.697
Ready!

29:38.248 --> 29:39.961
Kali!

29:46.369 --> 29:48.546
Kali, what are you doing?

29:52.493 --> 29:55.139
No! No, you must stop!

30:05.029 --> 30:06.413
No...

30:27.965 --> 30:29.574
Kali!

30:30.406 --> 30:32.085
The end...

30:32.258 --> 30:34.425
The end of days!

30:34.606 --> 30:36.858
The great flood!

30:37.079 --> 30:39.529
The great flood is coming!

30:59.882 --> 31:03.111
We're almost at the coordinates.
Anything yet?

31:03.146 --> 31:05.780
Yeah, reports of
seismic activity in the area,

31:05.815 --> 31:07.549
low-grade,
but pretty constant.

31:07.584 --> 31:10.545
I'd say we've got to be
getting pretty close.

31:12.695 --> 31:15.797
I'm just getting some weird
mapping data here.

31:16.545 --> 31:19.149
- Okay, that's just crazy.
- What is it?

31:19.184 --> 31:22.290
I'm cross-checking with
our nautical charts. Just hold on.

31:25.218 --> 31:28.315
Okay, either we're
totally off course, or...

31:29.352 --> 31:31.576
Doc, I'm reading
a chain of islands dead ahead,

31:31.611 --> 31:34.304
but there's nothing in the charts
indicating any land mass,

31:34.339 --> 31:35.689
just open ocean.

31:35.724 --> 31:37.697
That's because it's new.

31:45.086 --> 31:48.415
- She's not making earthquakes.
- She's making land.

31:52.982 --> 31:55.193
This is Magnus.
We have a complication.

31:55.228 --> 31:57.411
- Are you getting these images?
- Yes, we are.

31:57.446 --> 31:59.350
Sonar indicates tectonic plates

31:59.351 --> 32:01.272
are diverging rapidly.

32:01.899 --> 32:03.725
We're also detecting
a smaller vessel

32:03.760 --> 32:07.033
- approximately six miles west of your position.
- What do you want to bet it's Forsythe?

32:07.068 --> 32:09.095
This is the captain.
We're moving to intercept.

32:09.130 --> 32:11.750
Don't!
He's got control of Bertha.

32:11.785 --> 32:14.616
If we try taking his ship,
there's no telling what he'll do.

32:14.651 --> 32:17.294
That's why he's out here alone.
He has the ultimate bodyguard.

32:17.329 --> 32:18.944
If she keeps building
land at this rate...

32:18.979 --> 32:22.012
It'll cause massive destruction
to the entire region, I know.

32:22.047 --> 32:25.520
We're circling around, trying to get
a better lock on her position.

32:27.423 --> 32:29.529
Copy that.
Standing by.

32:30.538 --> 32:32.988
Ready deployment
of all depth charges.

32:33.023 --> 32:36.123
If she can't finish this,
we will.

32:37.014 --> 32:38.827
Yes, sir.

32:42.052 --> 32:43.288
Ravi!

32:43.323 --> 32:46.425
People are saying there's something
happening a few streets over.

32:57.925 --> 32:59.356
Henry?

32:59.391 --> 33:00.960
I can't get a shot.

33:00.995 --> 33:03.118
We didn't anticipate
her making islands,

33:03.153 --> 33:05.406
- and they're kind of in the way.
- Dammit.

33:05.438 --> 33:07.793
What do you want me to do, doc?

33:08.769 --> 33:11.378
Target Forsythe's ship.

33:12.010 --> 33:13.549
Forsythe's ship?

33:13.584 --> 33:16.036
If we can't get a shot at Bertha,
we might be able to use the L-RAD

33:16.071 --> 33:18.590
to sever his connection to her.

33:19.380 --> 33:20.994
Oh, man...

33:23.815 --> 33:25.359
Kali!

33:25.747 --> 33:28.503
Kali, you must stop!
The end of days...

33:30.020 --> 33:32.636
I must...
I must find her.

33:32.928 --> 33:34.975
How can I find her?

33:40.665 --> 33:43.011
Dance...

33:46.856 --> 33:48.548
I can dance!

34:01.363 --> 34:03.691
I can dance!

34:07.926 --> 34:09.956
Kali!

35:32.162 --> 35:33.686
Kali!

35:41.538 --> 35:43.438
Damn, I'm losing her.

35:43.559 --> 35:45.317
Mr. Forsythe, we're tracking
a lone helicopter

35:45.352 --> 35:47.017
closing in on our position.

35:47.936 --> 35:49.336
Mr. Forsythe?

35:51.655 --> 35:53.055
Mr. Forsythe?

35:53.297 --> 35:55.197
It's Magnus.
Shoot her down.

36:04.359 --> 36:05.702
Doc!

36:05.737 --> 36:07.906
We have a weapons lock
on our position!

36:08.906 --> 36:10.307
He's got missiles?

36:10.471 --> 36:11.903
Of course he does.

36:22.458 --> 36:24.758
Deploying countermeasures.
Hang on!

36:30.496 --> 36:31.808
Yeah!

36:31.908 --> 36:33.327
Nice move, doc!

36:33.399 --> 36:34.932
Get ready to fire the weapon!

36:37.643 --> 36:40.110
We have missed the target.
20 seconds to reload.

36:54.065 --> 36:55.432
Namaskarr, Durga.

36:57.626 --> 36:58.959
Namaskarr, Kali.

37:02.642 --> 37:03.942
Sir, Bertha's slowing down.

37:03.943 --> 37:06.143
Her rate of volcanic activity
is decreasing.

37:06.178 --> 37:07.884
Come on, stay with me.

37:08.811 --> 37:10.146
- I have a shot!
- Take it!

37:17.773 --> 37:18.761
He was here.

37:18.796 --> 37:20.023
People saw him
only a few minutes ago.

37:20.048 --> 37:22.168
I know, I got the same story,
and something about a...

37:22.193 --> 37:24.280
Dancing, and
apparently, quite well.

37:24.315 --> 37:25.625
Will dancing?

37:26.282 --> 37:27.967
- Pull our people back.
- What?

37:28.002 --> 37:29.595
The dance, the <i>rapati sungu.</i>

37:29.630 --> 37:31.109
He's trying to reach Bertha.

37:31.144 --> 37:32.588
Get our people away from him.

37:37.894 --> 37:39.327
It worked.

37:39.595 --> 37:41.380
You heard me.

37:41.415 --> 37:43.165
<i>You summoned me.</i>

37:45.240 --> 37:46.566
Kali.

37:47.374 --> 37:50.508
Please, stop what you're doing.

37:51.170 --> 37:54.207
The makri is telling me
that there is danger.

37:54.282 --> 37:56.916
<i>You said your makri
was taken from you.</i>

37:57.255 --> 37:58.715
I know, but...

37:59.989 --> 38:01.789
I can still feel you.

38:03.775 --> 38:04.787
What you're doing...

38:04.812 --> 38:06.195
<i>Is what I am asked to do.</i>

38:06.405 --> 38:10.758
If you don't stop,
millions of people will die.

38:11.943 --> 38:13.358
<i>Then they will die.</i>

38:17.136 --> 38:18.636
But this herald...

38:20.269 --> 38:21.801
He doesn't respect you.

38:21.836 --> 38:23.457
He's only using you
for his own gain.

38:23.507 --> 38:24.515
<i>You are different?</i>

38:24.540 --> 38:25.805
Yes!

38:27.188 --> 38:28.588
I respect you.

38:29.414 --> 38:30.821
Your power is incredible,

38:31.021 --> 38:33.558
but killing innocent people
is not what you're meant to do.

38:33.593 --> 38:35.820
<i>I have heard this from
other heralds in the past,</i>

38:36.843 --> 38:39.097
<i>a request for leniency,</i>

38:39.319 --> 38:40.619
<i>for mercy.</i>

38:41.724 --> 38:43.224
People are stronger now.

38:44.763 --> 38:46.129
If you hurt them,

38:47.158 --> 38:49.129
they'll hurt you back.

38:50.175 --> 38:52.472
<i>I only wish to be left alone.</i>

38:56.637 --> 38:58.142
What's Bertha doing now?

38:58.909 --> 39:00.275
Scans indicate...

39:01.714 --> 39:03.014
She's inactive!

39:03.582 --> 39:04.847
I think it worked!

39:04.882 --> 39:07.582
- Magnus, did you hit the target?
- <i>She's quiet.</i>

39:07.617 --> 39:08.948
But still conscious?

39:08.983 --> 39:10.189
<i>Yes.</i>

39:10.224 --> 39:13.224
<i>We should be able to guide her
back to her containment area.</i>

39:14.111 --> 39:15.425
<i>I'm heading back to the ship.</i>

39:15.460 --> 39:17.216
<i>We'll regroup
for the next phase.</i>

39:17.555 --> 39:18.855
Understood.

39:20.656 --> 39:21.965
Captain...

39:22.102 --> 39:25.214
Deploy all depth charges
to Bertha's position.

39:25.249 --> 39:27.339
Target her with
everything we have.

39:28.293 --> 39:29.630
Right now.

39:29.665 --> 39:30.933
Yes, sir.

39:30.968 --> 39:34.018
Ready all ordnance.
All charges, maximum depth.

39:34.079 --> 39:36.613
All charges max depth. Aye, sir.

39:36.686 --> 39:38.785
And cut off all Magnus'
radio communications

39:38.820 --> 39:40.085
with the other ships.

39:43.187 --> 39:44.811
<i>Why was I asked to make land?</i>

39:45.664 --> 39:47.015
Oh, I don't know,

39:48.448 --> 39:50.448
but you don't have to do
what he says.

39:51.542 --> 39:52.890
Please...

39:55.123 --> 39:57.373
<i>You danced well for me, Durga.</i>

39:59.654 --> 40:02.894
Well, I-I didn't have
much of a choice.

40:03.543 --> 40:05.737
I had to get your
attention, didn't I?

40:12.999 --> 40:13.733
No!

40:13.768 --> 40:15.235
Depth charges?

40:15.803 --> 40:18.103
Terrance, what the hell
are you doing?

40:19.651 --> 40:20.951
Dammit!

40:37.685 --> 40:40.075
What?
What is it?

40:40.325 --> 40:42.185
<i>You said you would
leave me alone!</i>

40:42.220 --> 40:43.510
What happened?

40:44.562 --> 40:46.062
<i>You betrayed me!</i>

40:53.121 --> 40:54.421
Will!

40:54.621 --> 40:55.921
Will!

41:02.958 --> 41:04.668
What the hell
are you playing at?

41:04.999 --> 41:06.298
She was calm!

41:06.333 --> 41:08.022
We had a window of opportunity.

41:08.057 --> 41:09.322
It had to be done.

41:09.965 --> 41:10.542
Captain...

41:10.577 --> 41:13.357
Please escort
Mr. Wexford to the brig,

41:13.392 --> 41:14.709
pending my orders.

41:14.744 --> 41:17.025
With all respect, ma'am,
I can't.

41:17.620 --> 41:19.011
I received a coded message

41:19.015 --> 41:20.525
on the secure
network frequency.

41:20.575 --> 41:21.740
Mr. Wexford...

41:21.775 --> 41:23.040
By unanimous consent,

41:23.075 --> 41:25.225
you are hereby relieved
of your command

41:25.260 --> 41:26.525
of the Sanctuary network,

41:26.791 --> 41:28.065
effective immediately.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.960
Dude, you cannot be serious.

41:29.995 --> 41:31.820
Don't interfere... Dude.

41:31.821 --> 41:34.385
I'm in charge of
operations now.

41:34.420 --> 41:35.827
You're remanded to custody

41:35.862 --> 41:37.566
pending further
disciplinary action.

41:37.601 --> 41:39.290
You had this planned all along.

41:39.325 --> 41:41.266
My orders were to
take over if you failed,

41:41.301 --> 41:43.207
and by letting Bertha
live yet once again,

41:43.242 --> 41:44.806
you most certainly have.

41:45.799 --> 41:47.142
I'm sorry, Helen.

41:47.225 --> 41:49.225
You gave me no choice.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.525
You have no idea
what you've done.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.867
I saved lives.

42:10.067 --> 42:11.925
I did what you refused to do.

42:13.941 --> 42:17.202
No, Terrance, this
is what you've done!

42:34.243 --> 42:36.098
Oh, she's mad.
