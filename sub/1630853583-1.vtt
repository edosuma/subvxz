WEBVTT

00:09.384 --> 00:10.552
<i>One, two.</i>

00:13.096 --> 00:15.474
<i>We're gonna start very soon, Maurice.
Sorry for the wait.</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:16.808
<i>Don't worry yourself.</i>

00:16.892 --> 00:19.311
<i>Can I get you anything, Mr. Flitcroft?
A cup of coffee?</i>

00:19.394 --> 00:21.313
<i>-Do you have any tea?
-Yeah, we have some tea.</i>

00:21.396 --> 00:23.565
<i>A cup of tea. Just a cup of tea.
Thanks, love.</i>

00:23.649 --> 00:25.400
<i>Milk, six sugars, please.</i>

00:25.484 --> 00:27.569
<i>-Six?
-Yes, six, please.</i>

00:27.653 --> 00:28.779
<i>Thank you.</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:30.656
<i>Hey, can you give me some levels, Maurice?</i>

00:30.739 --> 00:33.408
<i>-Some what?
-Talking. Can you just talk to me?</i>

00:33.492 --> 00:37.287
<i>Has the interview started?
'Cause I just ordered some tea.</i>

00:37.371 --> 00:38.539
<i>That's perfect.</i>

00:38.622 --> 00:41.375
-Okay. We good?
-We're rolling.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.876
<i>Haven't got my tea yet.</i>

00:42.960 --> 00:43.961
<i>All right, then.</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:48.340
<i>We're good to go in three, two, one.</i>

00:55.180 --> 00:58.892
I'm here with a legend
of the golfing world.

00:58.976 --> 01:03.480
A man who has broken records
and rewritten the history books.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.399
Maurice Flitcroft.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.193
Bless me.

01:08.819 --> 01:12.865
You made your name
in the British Open in 1976.

01:12.948 --> 01:16.118
Now, why did you choose
that particular tournament?

01:16.201 --> 01:19.496
Well, more it chose me, really.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.039
It was a calling.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.750
You Americans might call it a destiny.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.545
And it was an unlikely destiny,
wasn't it?

01:26.628 --> 01:29.715
Because you were working
as a crane operator at the time.

01:29.798 --> 01:30.674
Am I right?

01:30.757 --> 01:36.221
Yes, when I took up
the game of golf in 1975,

01:36.305 --> 01:40.642
I was working full time as a crane driver,
or operator, as you would say.

01:40.726 --> 01:44.897
So, well, tell us
about the young Maurice Flitcroft.

01:44.980 --> 01:48.525
Did you dream of becoming
a sportsman as a child?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.444
I had dreams,

01:50.527 --> 01:55.199
but, you know, where I come from,
Barrow-in-Furness,

01:55.282 --> 01:57.451
it's a small world.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.535
Put it like that.

02:12.090 --> 02:15.010
<i>The only job options for a lad like me
was the yard.</i>

02:15.093 --> 02:16.720
<i>Shipyard.</i>

02:16.803 --> 02:19.181
<i>"Shipyard fodder," they used to call us.</i>

02:19.264 --> 02:22.601
<i>My dad worked there
and his father before him.</i>

02:22.684 --> 02:24.144
<i>You go in on your feet.</i>

02:24.228 --> 02:25.938
<i>You come out in a box.</i>

02:27.397 --> 02:28.482
<i>As a child,</i>

02:28.565 --> 02:31.026
<i>I did have ambitions, of course.</i>

02:31.109 --> 02:33.654
<i>That I might do,
you know, something else.</i>

02:33.737 --> 02:37.366
<i>But any dreams I had tended
to end up in pieces.</i>

02:39.826 --> 02:44.331
<i>When the war came, I was sent to live
with a very nice family in Scotland.</i>

02:45.666 --> 02:47.292
<i>Things were very different there.</i>

02:47.376 --> 02:49.127
<i>They'd say things like:</i>

02:49.211 --> 02:51.505
What do you want to be
when you grow up, young Maurice?

02:51.588 --> 02:54.800
Probably just be
in the shipyard like me dad.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.969
You can be anything you want to be!

02:57.052 --> 02:58.720
The world is your oyster.

02:58.804 --> 02:59.805
<i>I read books.</i>

02:59.888 --> 03:01.181
<i>I learnt languages.</i>

03:01.265 --> 03:02.766
<i>I played the violin.</i>

03:02.850 --> 03:05.561
<i>I played to a very high standard,
actually.</i>

03:08.021 --> 03:09.648
Never mind, Maurice.

03:09.731 --> 03:10.691
Practice.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.068
Practice is the road to perfection.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.779
<i>Or I would have done
if the war hadn't ended,</i>

03:15.863 --> 03:16.989
<i>but it did.</i>

03:18.574 --> 03:20.826
<i>So I was soon back in Barrow.</i>

03:20.909 --> 03:23.829
<i>Ended up shipyard fodder after all.</i>

03:25.539 --> 03:30.377
<i>And it was at the shipyard
that you met your wife Jean, right?</i>

03:30.460 --> 03:31.378
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

03:31.461 --> 03:33.422
<i>I used to apply for other jobs.</i>

03:33.505 --> 03:35.007
<i>I tried lots of different things.</i>

03:35.090 --> 03:39.178
<i>And she'd let me use the post
in the office for free.</i>

03:40.804 --> 03:42.389
<i>She was very kind to me.</i>

03:43.432 --> 03:48.520
<i>In the evenings she ran,
like, a theater group for wayward kids.</i>

03:48.604 --> 03:51.273
<i>We got on like a house on fire.</i>

03:51.356 --> 03:52.858
<i>Pretty soon,</i>

03:52.941 --> 03:54.401
<i>I popped the question.</i>

03:55.485 --> 03:58.363
Jean Patterson, will you marry me?

03:59.531 --> 04:05.537
I promise I'll give you
champagne, caviar, diamonds.

04:05.621 --> 04:07.998
-We'll travel the world together--
-Stop.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.043
<i>Turns out she had a kid.</i>

04:11.126 --> 04:12.377
<i>Michael.</i>

04:12.461 --> 04:14.296
<i>Out of wedlock and all,</i>

04:14.379 --> 04:16.923
<i>which was a big deal in those days.</i>

04:17.007 --> 04:19.009
They call him all sorts at school.

04:20.344 --> 04:21.678
"Son of a whore."

04:23.055 --> 04:24.223
"Little bastard."

04:25.057 --> 04:26.517
Kids can be cruel.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.894
That's the teachers.

04:33.023 --> 04:36.276
So he never knew his dad?

04:36.860 --> 04:37.945
No.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.738
Never even met him.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.824
As far as he knows, he doesn't have a dad.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.578
Well, he does now.

04:53.710 --> 04:57.840
<i>All of a sudden, my own dreams,
well, they were put on hold.</i>

04:57.923 --> 04:59.842
<i>Because we were a family now.</i>

04:59.925 --> 05:02.594
<i>I had to help Michael find his dreams.</i>

05:02.678 --> 05:04.346
Well, take your pick, son.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.806
World's your oyster.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.766
That's for me. Racing driver.

05:07.850 --> 05:10.394
Astronaut. How about this?
Do you fancy a trip to the moon?

05:10.477 --> 05:11.603
No.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.230
-Engineering?
-Yeah.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.690
Want to read my book?

05:14.773 --> 05:16.316
What do you think? Does it go there?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.026
Put it the other way round.

05:18.610 --> 05:19.820
<i>Mikey got a degree.</i>

05:19.903 --> 05:22.489
<i>Ended up a manager at the yard.</i>

05:22.573 --> 05:25.534
<i>I always fancied a pop at academia myself,</i>

05:25.617 --> 05:29.997
<i>but pretty soon, we had not one,
but two more mouths to feed.</i>

05:30.831 --> 05:33.876
<i>Gene and James, twins.</i>

05:33.959 --> 05:36.461
<i>They loved disco dancing.</i>

05:36.545 --> 05:38.380
<i>Even won the school cup.</i>

05:46.513 --> 05:48.974
<i>As for me own dreams, well,</i>

05:49.057 --> 05:52.436
<i>by now they were a distant memory.</i>

05:52.519 --> 05:54.396
<i>But I made my peace with it.</i>

05:56.023 --> 06:00.027
<i>Then came the summer of 1975,</i>

06:00.110 --> 06:03.155
<i>and, well, everything changed.</i>

06:13.248 --> 06:15.584
Mom, just have
a look at the microwave.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.252
I prefer my own one, that's all.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.212
It's gas, Mom.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.923
-Gas ovens are basically mini-bombs.
-Out.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.091
It's not gone off yet
so I think we're all right.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.593
Can you lot shut up?

06:24.676 --> 06:26.803
Get out of the kitchen, Michael.
Thank you.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.348
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.390
Hey, hey, hey!

06:30.474 --> 06:32.768
Stop doing your stupid dancing
near the new TV!

06:32.851 --> 06:34.436
-It's not stupid dancing!
-Get out.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.314
-We're professional disco dancers.
-That's not a job.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.858
Dad, tell him it's a job.
It is a real job, isn't it, Dad?

06:39.942 --> 06:42.653
Good a job as any.
How do you switch this on?

06:42.736 --> 06:45.405
Dad, I've told you before,
you've got to use the remote control.

06:45.489 --> 06:46.823
Get out of that. Come on, Mike.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.200
This top is Gabicci!

06:48.283 --> 06:49.409
It's Gabicci!

06:49.493 --> 06:51.537
I said can you pipe it down
in there, please?

06:51.620 --> 06:52.955
Quiet, boys!

06:53.038 --> 06:56.083
-Mike, watch this. Can you do that?
-You use that to change the channels.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.543
It's got loads of them.

06:57.626 --> 06:58.752
How many?

06:58.836 --> 06:59.711
Three.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.129
Blimey.

07:01.213 --> 07:04.258
You can use that from anywhere,
providing that the lead reaches that far.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.135
Why can't you just use the switches
on the side?

07:08.136 --> 07:09.471
Yeah, but why would-- Get off!

07:09.555 --> 07:12.641
Why do you have to use the remote?
Why can't you just use switches?

07:12.724 --> 07:14.852
You can, but what's the point
when you got that?

07:14.935 --> 07:17.312
-I might be standing by--
-Shut it!

07:23.610 --> 07:25.070
Dinner is served.

07:26.446 --> 07:30.701
<i>Now you can see we've left Newton
and we're chugging across the Atlantic.</i>

07:30.784 --> 07:32.411
<i>The spacecraft is shown by this--</i>

07:32.494 --> 07:35.330
Look, don't quote me on this, but...

07:36.582 --> 07:38.333
well, it's top secret.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.713
The yard's gonna be nationalized.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.256
Government's taking over.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.513
And Hopkins has put me
in charge of the changeover.

07:51.597 --> 07:52.431
Well.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.851
Good for you, son.

07:55.934 --> 08:00.022
He must have a lot of faith in you,
giving you a big job like that.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.773
Yeah, I suppose.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.735
But it could be bad, Dad.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.698
There's gonna be a lot
of redundancies when the ax falls.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.659
I mean, a lot.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.710
They need you, he says.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.212
So that's good.

08:24.213 --> 08:25.631
What about you?

08:25.714 --> 08:26.882
Oh, well.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.551
I'll get another job if it comes to it.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.179
What job?

08:32.261 --> 08:33.263
I don't know.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.890
There's always the bins.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.520
Come here.

08:41.020 --> 08:41.855
I'm doing--

08:42.523 --> 08:43.357
Maurice.

08:49.029 --> 08:49.947
What is it?

08:51.281 --> 08:52.115
Sit down.

08:55.827 --> 08:56.662
Hey.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.207
I knew a young man once.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.794
Said he was gonna be a somebody.

09:05.629 --> 09:10.300
Promised me diamonds, caviar, champagne.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.886
"Travel the world," he said.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.807
Sounds like you should've married him.

09:22.521 --> 09:25.357
I know you've made sacrifices
for us, Maurice.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.361
You don't have to look after us anymore.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.197
It's your turn now.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.408
For what?

09:35.534 --> 09:37.369
Well, it's up to you, isn't it?

09:38.370 --> 09:39.955
Can't think of everything.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.366
-What we got today, then, Mol?
-Cheese and pickle.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.702
-What?
-My favorite, that is.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.163
Maurice, we've been hearing rumors

10:21.246 --> 10:23.332
there might be some business
going on in the yard.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.791
You heard anything?

10:25.792 --> 10:29.213
Look, I shouldn't be telling you lads,
it's secret.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.130
But...

10:30.923 --> 10:32.341
it's being nationalized.

10:32.424 --> 10:33.300
What does that mean?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.511
Redundancies. Lots of them.

10:35.594 --> 10:39.348
So if I were you,
I'd get looking for something else.

10:39.932 --> 10:40.891
Shit.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.185
I see it as an opportunity,
actually, really.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.102
You know, why not?

10:44.186 --> 10:45.479
What we got to lose?

10:45.562 --> 10:47.898
Seek and thou shalt find and all that.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.109
Willie, there must be something
you've always wanted to do.

10:51.193 --> 10:53.946
If you could do anything
in the whole world, what would you do?

10:54.029 --> 10:54.905
I don't know.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.615
What do you like doing?

10:58.408 --> 10:59.493
Drinking Guinness.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.498
Well, open an Irish pub.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.708
Your own Irish pub in Barrow.

11:07.543 --> 11:09.878
Cliff, you can go back to your old job.

11:09.962 --> 11:10.921
What old job?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.257
You said you did a bank job once.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.258
Right, yeah.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.759
Well, that's a--

11:15.843 --> 11:19.054
-That's a young man's game, that is, mate.
-Oh, come on, lads.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.265
We're in the prime of our lives.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.517
Shouldn't be talking like that.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.690
Yeah, I might go to the pub later on.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.943
I'm going up now, love.

11:33.026 --> 11:33.861
What are you doing?

11:33.944 --> 11:37.197
I've gotta finish this flipping
nun's habit before I turn in.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.241
Well, don't be too late.
You'll hurt your eyes.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.742
Well, it has to be done.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.913
-Night.
-Night.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.291
Night, love.

12:05.642 --> 12:10.981
<i>I believe that the job you do
is fundamental to the future of Britain.</i>

12:12.274 --> 12:13.984
<i>Newton from the bunker.</i>

12:20.449 --> 12:22.117
<i>And now to Watson.</i>

12:28.540 --> 12:30.959
<i>Just misses on the right.</i>

12:33.670 --> 12:35.964
<i>So if he can just get this in.</i>

12:45.098 --> 12:48.310
<i>It's all on this to equal Watson's score.</i>

12:57.736 --> 13:00.155
<i>The title goes to Tom Watson.</i>

13:01.323 --> 13:04.076
<i>On his first appearance
at this tournament.</i>

13:18.507 --> 13:20.717
<i>The new champion.</i>

13:20.801 --> 13:21.969
<i>Tom Watson.</i>

13:22.052 --> 13:23.637
<i>What a dream come true.</i>

14:47.930 --> 14:50.182
<i>So there we have it.</i>

14:50.265 --> 14:52.100
<i>What an image to end on.</i>

14:52.184 --> 14:55.020
<i>Tom Watson with the famous Claret Jug.</i>

14:55.896 --> 14:59.983
<i>I hope you'll join me, Tony Marsh,
and the rest of the commentary team</i>

15:00.067 --> 15:01.985
<i>for the Dunlop British Masters--</i>

15:02.069 --> 15:02.903
Dad.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.241
-You all right, love?
-We heard screaming.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.961
-Where is it?
-What you looking for, love?

15:57.332 --> 15:58.959
<i>Golf.</i>

15:59.042 --> 15:59.877
Golf?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.295
Aye, golf.

16:02.546 --> 16:03.380
-Golf?
-Golf?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.507
Saw it last night on me new telly.

16:05.591 --> 16:07.885
Going to have a crack at the British Open.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.470
Ten grand if you win it.

16:10.554 --> 16:11.388
Ten grand?

16:12.264 --> 16:13.265
Bloody hell.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.601
How do you go about getting
in the British Open, then?

16:15.684 --> 16:18.395
I don't know.
That's what I've got to find out.

16:18.896 --> 16:22.816
Bartender, beautician, busses.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.777
Sorry, there's nothing here
about the British Open.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.654
That's disappointing.

16:27.738 --> 16:30.199
Maybe you could ask someone
at your golf club?

16:30.282 --> 16:32.868
-No, I'm not a member of a club.
-Okay.

16:34.077 --> 16:37.748
So do you know anyone
who has anything to do with golf?

16:37.831 --> 16:38.916
No.

16:43.378 --> 16:44.254
Hang on.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.632
Yes, I do.

16:46.715 --> 16:47.549
I do!

17:01.230 --> 17:03.607
-Fingers.
-Right, next.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.233
What is a par?

17:05.317 --> 17:08.612
Par is the optimum amount of shots
you should take on any given hole.

17:08.694 --> 17:12.699
So for example, on a par four,
the optimal amount of shots is four.

17:12.782 --> 17:14.076
Correct.

17:14.159 --> 17:15.868
What is a birdie?

17:15.953 --> 17:17.454
That is one shot under the par.

17:17.538 --> 17:19.957
So for example, par four, three.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.667
-And a bogey?
-Bogey?

17:22.751 --> 17:25.087
I know that one, Dad.
Answer's one of these, mate.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.758
They're even better than I thought.

17:29.842 --> 17:32.052
So shiny, aren't they?

17:32.135 --> 17:34.513
-These were the cheapest ones and all.
-Really?

17:34.596 --> 17:36.723
-Look.
-Crikey.

17:36.807 --> 17:38.100
Number 19.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.102
Need to be a millionaire
to play this game.

17:40.185 --> 17:42.688
-You should see what the clothes cost.
-Really?

17:42.771 --> 17:43.939
Might get Cliff onto it.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.066
<i>...from a Maurice Flitcroft
in Barrow-in-Furness.</i>

17:46.149 --> 17:47.776
Dad! You're on telly!

17:47.860 --> 17:49.361
<i>-And he says...
</i>-No, what?

17:49.444 --> 17:52.948
<i>..."I was wondering how I might go about
getting into the British Open Championship</i>

17:53.031 --> 17:56.326
<i>as I quite fancy lifting
the old Claret Jug."</i>

17:56.410 --> 17:57.870
<i>Well, Maurice,</i>

17:57.953 --> 18:00.539
<i>all you have to do is write
to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club</i>

18:00.622 --> 18:04.251
<i>at St. Andrews in Scotland
and they'll send you an entry form.</i>

18:04.334 --> 18:05.627
<i>But remember,</i>

18:05.711 --> 18:09.173
<i>ask your mom and dad before
you use all their stamps and things.</i>

18:09.673 --> 18:11.049
<i>Always warms my cockles</i>

18:11.133 --> 18:15.179
<i>when we get letters
from keen youngsters like little Maurice.</i>

18:19.975 --> 18:22.936
Left arm perpendicular to the sternum.

18:25.022 --> 18:26.940
Head at 30 degrees.

18:28.317 --> 18:30.694
Knees flexed at 20.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.696
Just try and hit the ball.

18:36.742 --> 18:38.243
What are you playing at?

18:38.327 --> 18:39.828
Sorry!

18:40.329 --> 18:41.371
Flipping heck!

18:42.748 --> 18:44.708
-I don't owe you anything?
-No.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.502
-For all this?
-No. No.

18:46.585 --> 18:50.339
I got all this and all this
from my mate John down the market.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.299
-You got this too?
-Yeah, yeah.

18:52.382 --> 18:53.342
Suede.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.052
It's good stuff, innit?

18:55.135 --> 18:56.220
Hat's perfect.

19:01.350 --> 19:02.392
You what?

19:02.476 --> 19:05.395
Clothes of the gods, Cliff.

19:05.479 --> 19:08.357
Well, he only gets the best, does Jim.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.983
I thought it were John.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.735
John. John. Yeah, John.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.111
Yeah, good lad, John.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.573
These sandwiches look nice, Jean.

19:16.657 --> 19:17.491
Love.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.826
Love, can you stop worrying
about what you look like?

19:19.910 --> 19:22.621
Got to finish filling in this form first.

19:24.039 --> 19:26.083
What does that mean, handicap?

19:26.166 --> 19:29.044
That must be me ailments, I suppose.

19:29.127 --> 19:31.171
Like your false teeth?

19:31.255 --> 19:32.464
Lumbago.

19:32.548 --> 19:33.757
Touch of arthritis.

19:33.841 --> 19:36.385
-Shall I put that down?
-Aye, put that down.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.136
-Hello.
-You all right, lads?

19:39.304 --> 19:41.598
-Here you go, Dad. Get a load of that.
-What's that?

19:41.682 --> 19:43.475
Money so you can practice
on a golf course.

19:43.559 --> 19:45.227
Yeah, we got it dancing on high street.

19:45.310 --> 19:48.188
Honestly, should've seen it, Dad.
They were just chucking it at us.

19:48.272 --> 19:49.982
That's incredible.

19:50.065 --> 19:51.775
What do you hope to achieve?

19:51.859 --> 19:53.819
You know, with this dancing lark?

19:53.902 --> 19:54.987
-Money.
-Birds.

19:56.488 --> 19:59.491
"We're all of us in the gutter
but some of us are looking at the stars."

19:59.575 --> 20:00.868
Who said that?

20:00.951 --> 20:02.327
-Oscar Wilde.
<i>-Oscar Wilde.</i>

20:02.411 --> 20:03.954
What do you think he meant by that?

20:04.037 --> 20:05.914
Don't sleep in the gutter!

20:07.457 --> 20:09.001
Aim for the stars.

20:09.084 --> 20:12.838
I mean, isn't there a trophy
or a world cup or something?

20:12.921 --> 20:14.006
Yeah, think so.

20:14.089 --> 20:15.090
Well, enter it!

20:15.174 --> 20:16.466
Go and win it!

20:16.550 --> 20:17.759
But what if we lose?

20:17.843 --> 20:19.928
Doesn't matter.
At least you can say you tried.

20:20.012 --> 20:21.346
That's the main thing.

20:21.430 --> 20:23.348
There's more to life than money, boys.

20:23.432 --> 20:25.267
-Ain't that right, Cliff?
-Yeah.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.395
Though, having said that,
money is flipping handy.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.398
Especially if you play golf.

20:31.481 --> 20:32.316
-Yeah.
-Cheers!

20:32.399 --> 20:34.484
-Yeah, you're welcome, Dad.
-Thanks.

20:34.568 --> 20:35.736
Look at that, Jean!

20:35.819 --> 20:36.653
Hang on a minute.

20:36.737 --> 20:37.863
It's heavy.

20:37.946 --> 20:38.780
It says...

20:39.573 --> 20:42.326
"Don't need a handicap
if you're professional."

20:42.826 --> 20:46.955
Well, just cross out that other stuff.
Tick professional. Make things easier.

20:47.039 --> 20:48.373
Professional?

20:48.457 --> 20:49.875
-You sure?
-Listen,

20:49.958 --> 20:52.878
you didn't see me practicing this morning.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.964
I am a whisker away.

20:56.048 --> 20:56.882
All right.

20:57.674 --> 20:58.967
A whisker away.

22:22.551 --> 22:27.181
<i>Please welcome on the tee,
Maurice G. Flitcroft.</i>

22:34.062 --> 22:36.440
You all right down there, old boy?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.359
Yes.

22:39.443 --> 22:40.819
Hello, gents.

22:40.903 --> 22:44.364
Are you in the right place, old chap?

22:44.448 --> 22:48.327
Yes, I'm here to join the club.
And I see you're a three ball.

22:48.410 --> 22:51.830
If you care to make it a four,
I'm available.

22:51.914 --> 22:53.207
Happy to join.

22:54.166 --> 22:56.710
-We're waiting for someone.
-Yes.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.045
George.

22:59.129 --> 23:00.756
George Green.

23:04.009 --> 23:06.553
Actually, thanks for the offer, gents.

23:06.637 --> 23:09.181
But on second thought,

23:09.681 --> 23:12.184
I think I'd prefer to play
on my own today.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.102
Hope you don't mind.

23:14.186 --> 23:16.230
Maurice Flitcroft.

23:24.321 --> 23:25.697
Good luck, gents.

23:26.865 --> 23:27.866
Tossers.

23:28.659 --> 23:30.077
Flipping people.

23:31.620 --> 23:32.788
Snobs.

23:33.956 --> 23:35.541
-Bloody--
-Excuse me, sir!

23:35.624 --> 23:36.625
Hello, there.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.336
Allow me to introduce myself.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.922
I'm Bruce Atkins, the steward of the club.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.590
Hello, Bruce. I--

23:44.675 --> 23:46.009
I'm Maurice.

23:46.093 --> 23:48.595
How may I help you today, Maurice?

23:48.679 --> 23:50.764
I'm here to join the club, please.

23:51.849 --> 23:52.683
I see.

23:53.725 --> 23:54.810
Well, that's fine.

23:54.893 --> 23:57.604
But there is a procedure to follow
to get entry to the club.

23:57.688 --> 23:58.522
Procedure?

23:58.605 --> 24:01.567
Yes. First you must be recommended
by a committee member.

24:01.650 --> 24:03.569
Then you must play a round
with two members

24:03.652 --> 24:06.864
to ascertain your level of skill,
etiquette, et cetera.

24:06.947 --> 24:09.992
Then your application will be forwarded
to the members committee,

24:10.075 --> 24:13.120
whereupon, if accepted,
you'll be placed on the waiting list.

24:13.203 --> 24:15.163
How long's the waiting list?

24:15.247 --> 24:16.206
Currently two years.

24:16.290 --> 24:17.332
That's no good.

24:17.416 --> 24:20.460
-Really?
-No, I'm playing in the British Open.

24:20.544 --> 24:22.004
The British Open?

24:22.087 --> 24:25.174
So I'll just play a round now.

24:25.257 --> 24:26.091
Very well.

24:26.592 --> 24:27.801
That'll be five pounds.

24:27.885 --> 24:28.719
Five pounds?

24:28.802 --> 24:31.346
And you'd need to buy
some regulation golf shoes.

24:31.430 --> 24:33.140
I'm afraid we don't allow work boots.

24:33.223 --> 24:35.350
-How much are the shoes?
-Ten pounds.

24:35.434 --> 24:37.895
With the green fee,
that makes around 15.

24:37.978 --> 24:40.314
Do you have 15 pounds, Maurice?

24:57.414 --> 24:58.457
Here he is.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.292
Maurice G. Flitcroft.

25:08.217 --> 25:11.053
Only requires par for victory.

25:12.971 --> 25:16.308
Hey! Get off the golf course!

25:16.391 --> 25:18.018
What you doing?

25:18.101 --> 25:19.102
Hey!

25:21.104 --> 25:22.564
You cheeky sod!

25:22.648 --> 25:23.941
Left me balls!

25:25.234 --> 25:26.318
Are you deaf?

25:28.445 --> 25:29.613
-Tosser!
-Go on!

25:30.656 --> 25:32.157
-Hands in your pockets.
-Quite good.

25:32.241 --> 25:34.368
-Maurice?
-Yeah, it's not bad, is it?

25:35.369 --> 25:36.411
Bloody hell.

25:37.621 --> 25:39.665
I thought golf was supposed
to be relaxing, love?

25:39.748 --> 25:40.624
So did I.

25:40.707 --> 25:41.959
What's happened, Dad?

25:43.168 --> 25:45.254
I'm giving up on the Open, son.

25:45.337 --> 25:47.297
-No. No, you're not.
-I am, love.

25:47.381 --> 25:50.592
I said you're not.
Not until you've opened this. Go on.

26:11.029 --> 26:13.699
I said television is the only
way to keep up with the Americans.

26:13.782 --> 26:15.784
Prestige counts for nothing
if you can't see it.

26:15.868 --> 26:17.244
And what did they say?

26:18.203 --> 26:20.664
Excuse me, Mr. Mackenzie, sir?

26:20.747 --> 26:21.582
Yes, Jenny.

26:21.665 --> 26:23.500
Again, what can I do for you?

26:23.584 --> 26:26.962
Sorry, sir. I just want
to show you this application.

26:27.838 --> 26:29.756
I'm not sure what to do with it.

26:30.966 --> 26:31.800
Oh, good Lord.

26:31.884 --> 26:34.011
Well, I mean, he's ticked professional,
so--

26:34.094 --> 26:36.263
But I just wonder whether it's real.

26:36.346 --> 26:37.556
Whether what's real?

26:37.639 --> 26:39.766
Whether he really is a professional.

26:39.850 --> 26:42.895
Why would someone say they're
a professional when they're not?

26:43.478 --> 26:45.856
Well, to get into the Open.

26:46.648 --> 26:50.319
I don't think anyone's gonna be
stupid enough to do that, my dear.

26:50.402 --> 26:53.447
No, that would be very stupid indeed.

26:59.161 --> 27:00.245
I'm in.

27:01.163 --> 27:04.166
I best get Cliff
to get me some new golf shoes.

27:25.437 --> 27:27.981
Practice is the road to perfection.

27:41.119 --> 27:41.995
Flipping heck.

27:43.121 --> 27:44.873
Can't see a flipping thing.

27:49.002 --> 27:49.962
Fore.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.609
Hey, that was a good one.

28:13.151 --> 28:14.361
I think.

28:17.948 --> 28:18.782
Mike.

28:22.369 --> 28:23.996
Hey, Dad. What you doing here?

28:24.079 --> 28:26.665
Hello, son. This your new office, is it?

28:26.748 --> 28:28.625
-Yeah.
-Come on, then, give us a look.

28:28.709 --> 28:31.003
Not a great time now.
We got some big deals going down.

28:31.086 --> 28:32.713
Oh, big deals?

28:33.338 --> 28:35.424
-Want a ciggy?
-No, no, no. You're okay.

28:35.507 --> 28:41.013
Son, I might need a couple of days off,
next Thursday, Friday.

28:41.096 --> 28:43.599
-Can you swing it?
-Yeah, yeah. I'll see what I can do.

28:43.682 --> 28:49.062
I think I might've found myself a new job,
you know, like you said.

28:49.146 --> 28:51.106
-Great, Dad.
-I might take it. It's just great.

28:51.190 --> 28:53.025
It's quite exciting, actually.

28:53.108 --> 28:56.987
I'm entering the British Open,
you know, the golf thing.

28:57.529 --> 28:59.990
Really gonna go for it.
I think I'm pretty good, actually.

29:00.073 --> 29:02.201
Dad, sorry, I've got to go.
But that's good, Dad.

29:02.284 --> 29:06.079
Well, it's good to have your support, son.
Go on. Get your deals. Go on.

29:06.163 --> 29:08.582
-Okay, I'll see you later.
-All right.

29:08.665 --> 29:09.791
Mike.

29:09.875 --> 29:12.169
Hi, nice to meet you. Mike Flitcroft.

29:12.252 --> 29:13.629
-Be fine.
-It's not gonna fit.

29:13.712 --> 29:15.297
-Oh, yeah.
-Gene?

29:15.380 --> 29:17.799
-It's aluminum, so it'll bend, won't it?
-There's no way.

29:18.759 --> 29:20.260
-Bloody hell.
-Very nice.

29:20.344 --> 29:21.386
-Shit.
-Lovely.

29:21.470 --> 29:23.472
Just-- It's all right.
It's fine. It's fine.

29:23.555 --> 29:25.933
-Well done, Gene.
-Can you help instead of just judging?

29:26.016 --> 29:28.101
-We ready, lads?
-Yeah, fine. Yeah, all good.

29:28.185 --> 29:30.521
Yeah, ready.
We're just putting it in the--

29:30.604 --> 29:31.522
No, no. I'll--

29:32.064 --> 29:34.566
-Here. Come here. Come here.
-That's all fine. Here you are.

29:34.650 --> 29:36.568
-Yeah?
-Now, look at that.

29:37.152 --> 29:40.906
Just remember, know whatever happens,

29:40.989 --> 29:43.158
no one can say you didn't try.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.371
-You got your sandwiches.
-Sandwiches.

29:48.413 --> 29:50.541
Good. Made plenty there for the--

29:50.624 --> 29:51.625
-Thanks, Mom.
-I got it.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.168
Don't eat them all on the journey.

29:53.252 --> 29:54.461
-No.
-Oh, no, no.

29:54.545 --> 29:55.462
Come here, you.

29:56.547 --> 29:57.464
Good luck.

29:58.006 --> 29:58.841
I love you.

30:06.598 --> 30:09.017
-Come on, come on.
-No, put me down.

30:11.061 --> 30:12.688
Come on, you'll be late.

30:12.771 --> 30:14.022
Get going.

30:14.106 --> 30:15.774
I know. I love you too.

30:18.443 --> 30:22.030
I'm gonna get some claret for that jug
on the mantelpiece.

30:22.114 --> 30:24.116
-Do it.
-I'll get onto it.

30:25.242 --> 30:26.451
-Bye, love.
-Yeah.

30:26.535 --> 30:27.578
Love you more.

30:36.378 --> 30:41.133
<i>The sun is shining this morning
at Formby Golf Club on Merseyside,</i>

30:41.216 --> 30:43.051
<i>where, in a few minutes' time,</i>

30:43.135 --> 30:47.222
<i>the new stars of the golfing world
will take their first steps</i>

30:47.306 --> 30:49.892
<i>to claiming the historic Claret Jug</i>

30:49.975 --> 30:53.437
<i>and a check for 10,000 pounds.</i>

30:53.520 --> 30:55.480
<i>Join us here in about an hour</i>

30:55.564 --> 30:59.443
<i>for what promises to be
a tournament to remember.</i>

31:12.122 --> 31:14.249
You practice on the beach and all?

31:14.875 --> 31:16.835
Sorry, my English--

31:16.919 --> 31:17.961
Oh, no.

31:19.046 --> 31:21.798
You practice on the beach too?

31:21.882 --> 31:25.093
Yes. At least we'll be good
from the bunkers?

31:26.178 --> 31:28.013
Yeah, the bunkers.

31:30.682 --> 31:33.268
Maurice. Maurice Flitcroft.

31:33.352 --> 31:35.729
-Severiano Ballesteros.
-You what?

31:35.812 --> 31:37.105
Just call me Seve.

31:37.189 --> 31:38.732
Oh, <i>sí,</i> Seve, Seve.

31:39.274 --> 31:40.359
Are you nervous?

31:42.069 --> 31:43.820
Yes and no.

31:43.904 --> 31:45.739
You don't get nervous?

31:46.615 --> 31:47.741
No. See...

31:48.784 --> 31:50.786
a mistake, to me...

31:51.620 --> 31:55.916
is an opportunity to learn
something new about golf.

31:58.210 --> 31:59.336
What did I do wrong?

31:59.837 --> 32:05.050
How can I do... good-er?

32:05.133 --> 32:06.510
You know what I mean?

32:07.553 --> 32:10.180
Love your mistakes, Seve.

32:11.014 --> 32:14.476
And you can't go wrong.

32:15.519 --> 32:17.646
I hope your golf
is as good as your Spanish.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.273
Oh, no, no, no.

32:19.356 --> 32:20.774
Oh, no, Seve. My golf--

32:20.858 --> 32:25.070
My golf is much better.

32:25.737 --> 32:27.072
Watch out, Seve.

32:27.823 --> 32:29.032
Until next time.

32:30.158 --> 32:31.660
Until testicles.

32:58.437 --> 32:59.521
Right-o, son.

33:00.189 --> 33:01.315
What's first up?

33:01.899 --> 33:02.941
First hole.

33:03.817 --> 33:07.738
Four hundred and sixty yards,
trouble left and right.

33:09.656 --> 33:12.034
Four hundred and sixty yards. Par 5?

33:12.117 --> 33:13.911
-Par four.
-Par four.

33:16.121 --> 33:18.373
I reckon take a driver,
get it right up there.

33:18.457 --> 33:20.000
Give us a chance going at the green.

33:20.083 --> 33:23.962
No. I've been a bit wild, you know,
just of late, with my driver.

33:24.046 --> 33:27.633
I'll take-- I'll take my 4-wood.
I never miss with that.

33:27.716 --> 33:29.718
Yeah. Okay.

33:37.226 --> 33:39.144
Sorry, Dad. There's no 4-wood.

33:39.895 --> 33:40.729
You what?

33:40.812 --> 33:42.648
I must have left the 4-wood in the car.

33:46.568 --> 33:49.738
-It's James' fault. I did tell him.
-No, no. All right, all right, son.

33:49.821 --> 33:50.739
It's all right.

33:51.365 --> 33:52.658
I'll take my driver.

33:53.283 --> 33:56.286
-Mind your language on the course.
-Yeah, sorry, Dad.

33:57.329 --> 34:00.541
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is game number 14.

34:00.624 --> 34:02.960
Please welcome on the tee,

34:03.043 --> 34:09.299
representing Pontypool Golf Club, Wales,
and sponsored by Conway's,

34:09.382 --> 34:10.967
Jim Howard.

34:26.692 --> 34:27.818
Fucking hell.

34:29.945 --> 34:32.281
Please welcome on the tee,

34:32.364 --> 34:35.576
representing La Boudin Golf Club, France,

34:35.659 --> 34:38.453
and sponsored by McGranger Sport,

34:38.536 --> 34:39.996
Laurent Lambert.

34:56.638 --> 34:59.600
And finally, please welcome on the tee,

34:59.683 --> 35:03.187
representing Cumbria County
Golf Club, England,

35:03.270 --> 35:07.316
and sponsored by Vickers Shipyard,

35:08.025 --> 35:09.860
Maurice G. Flitcroft.

36:28.564 --> 36:31.149
Right, son. What we got left?

36:32.734 --> 36:35.529
Well, hole's 460,

36:35.612 --> 36:39.533
and what we gone? Eight.

36:40.158 --> 36:42.619
So, four five two to the pin.

36:42.703 --> 36:47.332
Right. I'll take me three iron,
I'll just go for position.

36:47.749 --> 36:48.584
Yeah.

37:04.933 --> 37:06.059
Great shot, Dad!

37:06.143 --> 37:07.144
It's alright.

37:07.686 --> 37:08.896
Yeah, that'll do.

37:53.273 --> 37:55.067
Gene. Concentrate.

37:55.150 --> 37:57.027
-Yeah, I-- Yeah, I was.
-Flipping heck.

37:59.488 --> 38:00.322
You see?

38:17.798 --> 38:18.924
Go on! Go on!

38:35.607 --> 38:36.733
Alright?

38:41.154 --> 38:42.614
-Tony, it's Lloyd.
-Yes.

38:42.698 --> 38:45.784
Listen, I want everything
you can find on a "Maurice Flitcroft."

38:47.244 --> 38:51.665
<i>F-L-I-T-C-R-O-F-T.</i>

38:51.748 --> 38:53.000
Flitcroft.

38:57.212 --> 38:59.756
Half time scores, please, gents.
Jim Howard?

38:59.840 --> 39:01.508
Thirty-three. Roundabout.

39:01.592 --> 39:04.011
Thank you. Laurent Lambert?

39:04.094 --> 39:05.179
Thirty-two.

39:05.262 --> 39:07.181
-Right, half way there, Gene.
-Thirty-two.

39:07.264 --> 39:09.516
And Maurice Flitcroft?

39:09.600 --> 39:11.059
Sixty-three.

39:11.810 --> 39:12.811
Sorry, say that again.

39:12.895 --> 39:15.314
Sixty-three.

39:21.361 --> 39:22.362
Good God.

39:26.241 --> 39:29.286
We, in Scotland,
invented the game of golf.

39:29.369 --> 39:31.955
The British Open is the oldest
golf tournament in the world.

39:32.039 --> 39:35.334
The most respected
and prestigious

39:35.417 --> 39:39.004
and we must do all we can
to burnish that reputation.

39:39.087 --> 39:41.548
So you can say that to your dad
the next time he spouts

39:41.632 --> 39:45.302
any of that nonsense, okay?
Thank you for your time.

39:47.221 --> 39:49.765
Maurice Flitcroft has hit a sixty-three.

39:50.557 --> 39:54.436
Sixty-three? How the hell did that happen?

39:54.520 --> 39:56.188
-I've no idea.
-Do the press know?

39:56.271 --> 39:57.231
Not yet.

39:57.856 --> 40:00.275
-Good, well let's bloody keep it that way.
-Yeah.

40:08.450 --> 40:12.871
I must say, that was a bit disappointing.

40:14.456 --> 40:15.999
Mr. Flitcroft.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.042
Keith Mackenzie,

40:17.125 --> 40:19.253
secretary of the Royal
and Ancient Golf Society.

40:19.336 --> 40:22.256
-May I have a word with you, please?
-Oh, course, course.

40:22.339 --> 40:23.507
Here.

40:23.590 --> 40:27.469
It's an honor to meet you, sir.
I'm very much enjoying the--

40:27.553 --> 40:29.221
You know, the championship.

40:29.304 --> 40:31.640
Good. Good, so are we, thank you.

40:31.723 --> 40:34.810
However my colleague
and I were just wondering if you

40:35.269 --> 40:37.771
might've had your fill of it, so to speak.

40:37.855 --> 40:39.398
-I'm sorry?
-We were just wondering

40:39.481 --> 40:41.984
if you'd like to retire, you know?

40:42.067 --> 40:48.115
I'm not sure I follow you.
I'm sorry. I must get to the next tee.

40:48.198 --> 40:50.826
Alright, Mr. Flitcroft.
Let me speak plainly.

40:50.909 --> 40:52.494
We can all see you don't belong here,

40:52.578 --> 40:55.539
so why don't you just quietly
gather up your things

40:55.622 --> 40:57.958
and let's not cause a scene, shall we?

40:59.251 --> 41:02.921
You know, there's one thing
I can promise you.

41:03.005 --> 41:06.717
Mr. Mackenzie, and that is no.

41:06.800 --> 41:10.637
No, I certainly will not be retiring.

41:10.721 --> 41:14.349
My swing's just about to,
you know, click in.

41:16.435 --> 41:18.937
So, if you'll excuse me, I must get on.

41:22.065 --> 41:25.819
I must just thank a Mrs. T. Holness
of Liphook Golf Club

41:25.903 --> 41:27.446
for a most wonderful cake.

41:27.529 --> 41:29.823
A Victoria sponge no less.

41:29.907 --> 41:32.534
Now, my producer's just handed
me a piece of paper.

41:33.327 --> 41:35.662
And either I need a new pair of glasses

41:35.746 --> 41:38.081
or there's something quite
extraordinary happening

41:38.165 --> 41:39.583
out there on the course.

41:39.666 --> 41:42.377
That's nothing.
Have you seen the new Audi 80?

41:42.461 --> 41:44.129
-Bloody hell.
-Bloody hell.

41:44.213 --> 41:46.548
-She is a beauty.
-Gorgeous, gorgeous.

41:46.632 --> 41:48.509
<i>The word is,
he's played the first nine holes</i>

41:48.592 --> 41:50.802
<i>in a phenomenal 63 shots.</i>

41:50.886 --> 41:52.638
Oh, see, beautiful lines. Clear lines.

41:52.721 --> 41:55.516
I don't bloody believe it.
Boys, look who it is.

41:56.266 --> 41:57.392
Who is it?

41:57.476 --> 41:59.228
Some plonker who was here not long back.

41:59.311 --> 42:01.104
He said he was playing
in the British Open,

42:01.188 --> 42:03.106
-I thought he was having me on.
-Good Lord.

42:03.190 --> 42:06.235
<i>His card reads seven, nine, eight, ten,</i>

42:06.318 --> 42:08.987
<i>there's a 12 there
with a question mark next to it.</i>

42:09.071 --> 42:10.572
<i>Not sure what that means.</i>

42:10.656 --> 42:12.032
<i>There's a six. That's--</i>

42:13.742 --> 42:16.787
<i>Now, I think the authorities
will be wondering how this happened.</i>

42:18.163 --> 42:20.040
<i>It says here his name is...</i>

42:20.999 --> 42:23.836
<i>Maurice G. Fl--</i>

42:24.378 --> 42:26.338
Oi, what's got into you Flitcroft?

42:26.421 --> 42:28.715
Sorry, I was just trying
to get a better signal but--

42:29.842 --> 42:31.927
The snug, come on!

42:35.222 --> 42:38.892
<i>So, Clarke leads by one from
Roberts on this opening morning.</i>

42:38.976 --> 42:42.145
<i>Now then, back to our intrepid
hacker on the 13th.</i>

42:47.818 --> 42:50.654
<i>He's celebrating like
he just holed for a birdie.</i>

42:51.196 --> 42:52.322
<i>But that was for a ten.</i>

42:53.574 --> 42:56.660
<i>That makes for an astonishing plus 38.</i>

42:56.743 --> 42:58.579
<i>I've never seen a number like that before.</i>

43:00.956 --> 43:03.083
<i>Now, back to the man of the moment.</i>

43:03.166 --> 43:07.921
<i>He's lost two balls on this hole.
Which makes this one a nine and...</i>

43:09.173 --> 43:12.176
<i>That's in! And the crowd go wild.</i>

43:13.218 --> 43:14.678
Tony, what've you got for me?

43:15.470 --> 43:16.680
A crane driver?

43:18.140 --> 43:19.016
Where from?

43:20.559 --> 43:21.977
Have you got an address?

43:28.984 --> 43:29.943
Stop, we got it.

43:30.027 --> 43:31.528
Stop moving, Flitcroft.

43:32.279 --> 43:36.325
<i>Oh, dear. That's his fourth shot,
he's still not out of the bunker.</i>

43:36.408 --> 43:38.493
<i>At this rate he's gonna
end up in Australia.</i>

43:39.411 --> 43:43.624
<i>Now, either someone's slipped some
Spanish licorice into my tea</i>

43:43.707 --> 43:46.293
<i>or his caddy is wearing basketball pumps.</i>

43:46.919 --> 43:49.213
<i>They are a pair of bobby dazzlers.</i>

43:49.296 --> 43:50.589
How do I know him?

43:51.173 --> 43:55.260
<i>It says here, he's representing
Cumbria County Golf Club in Barrow.</i>

43:55.344 --> 43:59.223
<i>Well, if he's the best they can do
I wouldn't like to see the rest of them.</i>

43:59.848 --> 44:04.895
<i>And he has a sponsor, believe it or not.
Vickers Shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness.</i>

44:04.978 --> 44:07.147
<i>I wouldn't like to sail
on one of their boats</i>

44:07.231 --> 44:08.398
<i>if he's been building them.</i>

44:08.482 --> 44:10.734
<i>Well, the authorities
aren't going to like it,</i>

44:10.817 --> 44:14.613
<i>but I can tell you right now,
the name of Maurice Flitcroft</i>

44:14.696 --> 44:17.074
<i>will go down in history.</i>

44:20.494 --> 44:22.204
It's quite a common name.

44:34.925 --> 44:35.926
What time is it?

44:52.943 --> 44:53.944
There.

44:55.863 --> 44:56.905
Look at this crowd, Dad!

44:56.989 --> 44:59.783
Yeah. Must be doing something right.

45:06.707 --> 45:11.670
Well, let's-- You know,
give them something to cheer about.

45:12.379 --> 45:13.422
Four iron.

45:56.465 --> 45:57.508
Where is it?

46:03.096 --> 46:04.640
Next to the flipping pin, Dad!

46:30.249 --> 46:33.210
<i>Well, this fellow is the story of the day.</i>

46:33.293 --> 46:35.087
<i>Maurice Flitcroft,</i>

46:35.170 --> 46:36.922
<i>on the last for a birdie.</i>

46:38.173 --> 46:40.008
<i>It'll be a surprise if this goes in.</i>

46:43.262 --> 46:45.097
<i>Wait until you hear the roar</i>

46:46.265 --> 46:47.516
<i>if it does.</i>

47:05.117 --> 47:08.370
<i>Oh, and it misses on the right-hand side.</i>

47:08.912 --> 47:10.497
<i>It was a good effort.</i>

47:18.172 --> 47:21.717
<i>This is for, I think, 119.</i>

47:27.681 --> 47:30.767
<i>Ooh, that was not a positive stroke.</i>

47:38.609 --> 47:41.612
<i>It's getting a little bit grisly now.</i>

47:43.488 --> 47:45.324
<i>And hopefully he'll put this in.</i>

47:46.450 --> 47:47.451
<i>And he does!</i>

47:48.285 --> 47:52.414
<i>That's 121. Remarkable.</i>

47:58.462 --> 48:00.047
<i>Ooh, double trouble!</i>

48:04.551 --> 48:08.597
<i>I believe that's called the caterpillar,
that move, eh?</i>

48:08.680 --> 48:11.099
<i>Seen my grandson do that.</i>

48:12.518 --> 48:14.686
<i>Not on a golf course, I must admit.</i>

48:15.646 --> 48:20.150
<i>I'm afraid with a score like that
he won't be coming back tomorrow.</i>

48:20.234 --> 48:25.280
<i>But whether you like it or not,
the day belongs to Maurice Flitcroft.</i>

48:34.331 --> 48:36.625
-Hello?
-Hello, can I help you at all?

48:37.251 --> 48:40.337
Oh, sorry. I'm looking for
Maurice Flitcroft's house?

48:40.420 --> 48:41.922
Oh, well, you found it.

48:42.005 --> 48:45.175
I'm Jean Flitcroft. Maurice is my husband.

48:45.259 --> 48:47.010
Maurice. Lloyd Donovan, <i>Sun </i>newspaper.

48:47.094 --> 48:49.012
-Hello.
-Just wondered if you had any comments

48:49.096 --> 48:50.931
on what your husband did
at the Open today?

48:51.014 --> 48:52.432
Oh, how'd he do?

48:52.516 --> 48:53.892
He shot 121.

48:54.518 --> 48:56.270
It's the highest score in major history.

48:56.353 --> 48:59.648
Oh, that's good! That mean he's won?

49:00.232 --> 49:03.443
No. A high score is bad.

49:04.570 --> 49:05.988
Is it? Oh, well.

49:06.780 --> 49:09.116
Never mind, you've got to start
somewhere, ain't you.

49:10.158 --> 49:12.619
About to pop the kettle on,
do you want to come in for tea?

49:12.703 --> 49:14.663
-Want a biscuit?
-Thank you very much, yeah.

49:14.746 --> 49:17.124
-Maurice.
-Maurice.

49:18.792 --> 49:20.669
How does it feel to have shot
the worst round

49:20.752 --> 49:22.129
in the history of the Open?

49:22.212 --> 49:26.466
I don't feel the score was a fair
reflection on the play, actually.

49:26.884 --> 49:29.636
What score would be a fair
reflection of your play, Maurice?

49:29.720 --> 49:33.307
That's hard to tell,
it's the first round I've ever played.

49:34.057 --> 49:36.852
What do you put your bad
score down to, Maurice?

49:36.935 --> 49:40.355
Well, I'd say the main problem
with my game today

49:40.439 --> 49:42.816
was that I left my four wood in the car.

49:42.900 --> 49:46.320
I don't mean to make excuses
but I'm deadly accurate

49:46.403 --> 49:48.197
with my four wood. Deadly.

49:49.448 --> 49:52.576
What made you enter the Open?
Was it a joke?

49:53.744 --> 49:59.082
Well, I-- No, no. No, it's no joke.

49:59.583 --> 50:01.919
Well, I-- No.

50:02.002 --> 50:04.254
Are you gonna try again next year?

50:06.089 --> 50:10.636
Yes. Yes, so, I'll be back next year.
I just need to practice.

50:10.719 --> 50:14.973
Practice more, a bit more and, well,
"practice is the road to perfection,"

50:15.057 --> 50:20.062
so, if you'll excuse me.
I'll see you next year, chaps.

50:20.145 --> 50:21.605
Thank you, Maurice.

50:21.688 --> 50:22.981
Right-o, Maurice.

50:28.445 --> 50:30.155
You showed them, didn't you, Dad?

50:30.906 --> 50:32.908
Quiet, quiet when you go in, lads.

50:32.991 --> 50:35.744
-Your mom must've gone to bed.
-What you doing? Yeah, sorry.

50:36.537 --> 50:40.249
Oh, still, look at least you tried.

50:40.332 --> 50:42.376
You know, that's the
main thing ain't it, Dad?

50:42.459 --> 50:43.877
Oh, yeah, that's right, son.

50:43.961 --> 50:46.630
-Enjoyed it, I did.
-Yeah, good.

50:46.713 --> 50:50.509
-Alright. I'll just...
-You go in. I'll just get me things.

50:50.592 --> 50:51.510
Okay.

51:39.474 --> 51:41.935
Surprise!

51:44.521 --> 51:47.399
Flipping heck, you nearly
gave me a heart attack!

51:48.525 --> 51:50.819
-You didn't tell me, lads!
-No, I didn't know either.

51:50.903 --> 51:52.821
-You didn't know? Willie!
-She didn't tell us.

51:52.905 --> 51:53.906
Alright, Mol.

51:54.698 --> 51:55.782
Cliff.

51:55.866 --> 51:56.867
Great, Mol!

51:56.950 --> 51:58.744
-Look!
-Look, they did that.

51:58.827 --> 52:01.830
-Champion!
-"Congratulations, Maurice. Our champion."

52:03.624 --> 52:04.499
And you are.

52:04.583 --> 52:06.126
You did so well.

52:08.337 --> 52:11.798
I wasn't quite as good as I thought I was.

52:11.882 --> 52:14.301
Hey, just your first time, love.

52:14.384 --> 52:16.178
You'll show them
next time around, Maurice.

52:16.261 --> 52:20.807
Well. Oh, next time, yeah.
Did the lads tell you about the 18th?

52:20.891 --> 52:23.393
I birdied it, nearly, right on the green.

52:23.477 --> 52:24.520
We saw it!

52:24.603 --> 52:26.146
-You saw it?
-We saw it on the telly,

52:26.230 --> 52:28.065
-in the shipyard, yeah.
-On the telly?

52:38.909 --> 52:40.911
-Quiche?
-Yeah, d'you like it?

52:40.994 --> 52:42.621
I don't mind it, quiche.

52:43.580 --> 52:46.333
-What are those you're eating?
-They're twirls.

52:46.416 --> 52:47.543
-Twirls?
-Twirls.

52:49.962 --> 52:50.879
Get off me!

52:51.672 --> 52:52.798
You alright, love?

52:52.881 --> 52:55.008
Hey, Mike, you coming for a snout?

52:55.092 --> 52:56.552
No, no, you're alright.

52:56.635 --> 52:58.762
Oh, did you see?

52:59.388 --> 53:00.430
Yeah, I did.

53:00.514 --> 53:03.642
Did you see the 18th,
where I nearly birdied it?

53:04.726 --> 53:06.270
No, I must've missed that bit.

53:06.353 --> 53:09.356
Well, I know the standard
wasn't ideal but--

53:09.439 --> 53:10.649
Not ideal?

53:11.483 --> 53:13.151
Well, what were you thinking, Dad?

53:14.152 --> 53:15.779
You've never even played golf before.

53:15.863 --> 53:18.115
I've never even heard you
mention golf in your life.

53:18.198 --> 53:19.283
But I told you.

53:19.366 --> 53:21.285
You've got to take these
things up at age six,

53:21.368 --> 53:23.203
you can't take them up at 46!

53:23.912 --> 53:24.955
Well, who says?

53:25.038 --> 53:29.042
Well, the world says.
Okay? Reality says.

53:29.710 --> 53:30.794
Well, look what happened.

53:31.545 --> 53:34.047
What? Well, I were a bit nervous but--

53:34.131 --> 53:35.883
Yeah, well, you had every right to be.

53:36.884 --> 53:38.677
Everyone at the yard's gone hopping mad.

53:39.928 --> 53:41.221
Well, what's he done to them?

53:41.722 --> 53:45.475
-This disparages the name of the shipyard.
-What's "disparaged" when it's at home?

53:45.559 --> 53:47.728
Have you swallowed
a dictionary, Michael, or what?

53:47.811 --> 53:50.230
Okay, you two. Can you get out, please.

53:52.733 --> 53:53.567
Nice.

53:55.611 --> 53:56.486
Well...

54:00.115 --> 54:02.284
I'm sorry I embarrassed you, son.

54:04.369 --> 54:06.121
It's not me I'm worried about, Dad.

54:07.497 --> 54:08.373
It's you.

54:10.667 --> 54:13.504
The redundancies are gonna
be decided this week.

54:15.005 --> 54:16.632
Hopkins watched it as well.

54:17.549 --> 54:18.967
He weren't best pleased.

54:20.594 --> 54:21.845
Sorry, Dad.

54:32.022 --> 54:32.856
Bye, Mike.

54:32.940 --> 54:34.650
Yeah, thanks for stopping by Mike.

54:34.733 --> 54:35.609
You off?

54:43.033 --> 54:44.117
So sorry.

54:45.369 --> 54:46.620
-Drink?
-Yeah, I'll have one.

54:46.703 --> 54:48.872
Yeah, lovely, get another round in.

54:48.956 --> 54:49.790
Nice.

55:01.844 --> 55:03.470
Love, if that's what he decides,

55:03.554 --> 55:07.182
you know, it gives you more
time to practice then, don't it?

55:08.642 --> 55:09.518
Hey?

55:12.271 --> 55:15.315
Oh, love. There's someone
I want you to meet.

55:15.816 --> 55:17.734
Hi, Maurice.

55:17.818 --> 55:19.820
I'm Lloyd Donovan. <i>Sun </i>newspaper.

55:20.571 --> 55:23.907
Listen, can I get an exclusive?

55:23.991 --> 55:25.284
Exclusive?

55:25.367 --> 55:26.201
Yeah.

55:26.660 --> 55:29.621
Aye. For a fee, you know.

55:29.705 --> 55:32.249
Oh, of course, yeah. Name your price.

56:06.158 --> 56:07.159
I want him barred!

56:08.202 --> 56:10.662
<i>I want him barred from
every club in the country!</i>

56:24.218 --> 56:25.219
Bruce.

56:26.803 --> 56:31.099
Maurice. I'd like to join, please.
I got the money.

56:32.059 --> 56:34.561
And I got the shoes.

56:36.980 --> 56:40.275
I appreciate the effort
you've made, Mr. Flitcroft.

56:40.359 --> 56:42.778
But I'm sorry, I can't accept this.

56:42.861 --> 56:43.695
Why not?

56:44.738 --> 56:46.782
We have orders from Mr. Mackenzie.

56:46.865 --> 56:49.576
Mr. Mackenzie? Can I see that, please?

56:50.827 --> 56:53.330
Golf club membership is for amateurs only.

56:53.413 --> 56:57.626
As I entered the Open as a professional,
I can't join a club?

56:57.709 --> 56:58.544
Correct.

56:58.627 --> 57:01.630
He accepts here
that I'm professional, that's fine.

57:01.713 --> 57:04.174
Professionals can
play on any course in the country.

57:04.258 --> 57:05.092
Yes.

57:06.718 --> 57:07.553
Great!

57:08.053 --> 57:13.225
Simply show them your Professional Golf
Association certificate and away you go.

57:15.435 --> 57:17.145
But I don't have one, Bruce.

57:18.146 --> 57:19.857
There's no chance of me
even getting one

57:19.940 --> 57:21.483
unless I belong to a club.

57:23.527 --> 57:26.238
Like I say, I'm sorry.

57:30.075 --> 57:32.953
I consider this action
a gross betrayal

57:33.036 --> 57:35.747
of me rights as a human being.
My human rights.

57:35.831 --> 57:40.002
Is the British Open, not by definition,
'open' to everyone?

57:41.003 --> 57:42.212
Furthermore...

57:44.590 --> 57:47.968
The British Open is indeed
open to all golfers,

57:48.051 --> 57:51.430
providing they have achieved
a standard fit for competing

57:51.513 --> 57:53.056
at a professional level.

57:53.724 --> 57:57.978
My mother plays golf, but would I
want her eligible for the British Open?

57:58.061 --> 57:59.521
No. I would not.

57:59.605 --> 58:02.733
Of course, I wouldn't want
your mother to be eligible

58:02.816 --> 58:04.443
for the Men's British Open,

58:04.526 --> 58:07.362
but I'd hope that you would
consider her eligible

58:07.446 --> 58:10.324
for the Women's British Open.
Don't you think?

58:11.283 --> 58:12.242
Good point.

58:12.326 --> 58:17.289
Ought I to add sexism to your
list of crimes, Mr. Mackenzie?

58:18.457 --> 58:20.125
I like that a lot.

58:20.209 --> 58:23.504
I now consider the tone
of your letters to be unbecoming

58:23.587 --> 58:27.007
to my office and will therefore
cease replying to them

58:27.090 --> 58:29.468
as of this correspondence.

58:49.530 --> 58:53.867
"Mr. Mackenzie feels he has said
all he has to say on this matter.

58:53.951 --> 58:57.829
Apart from to remind you
that any unlawful entering

58:57.913 --> 59:00.165
of a golf club is,
of course, trespassing."

59:00.249 --> 59:01.166
Flipping heck.

59:01.875 --> 59:04.127
-You alright, what's that?
-Yeah, no. Don't worry.

59:04.211 --> 59:06.839
He trusts this brings
this matter to a close.

59:06.922 --> 59:08.215
You'll show them yet, love.

59:10.759 --> 59:12.845
Just need to make them listen, that's all.

59:30.279 --> 59:32.948
<i>We've come outside to the studio car park</i>

59:33.031 --> 59:38.704
<i>to meet the man who shot
a world record of 121 at the British Open.</i>

59:38.787 --> 59:41.790
<i>He is the world's worst
professional golfer.</i>

59:41.874 --> 59:44.209
<i>No, I'm sorry. I don't agree with that.</i>

59:44.293 --> 59:47.462
<i>I'm not the world's worst golfer
and I'm willing to prove it.</i>

59:47.546 --> 59:48.630
<i>Okay, great.</i>

59:48.714 --> 59:52.050
<i>So, we have set up
a little golf course here in the car park.</i>

59:52.134 --> 59:55.512
<i>Yeah, it's not a golf course,
it's a putting green.</i>

59:55.596 --> 59:58.056
<i>Great. It's exciting, isn't it?</i>

1:00:01.351 --> 1:00:03.770
<i>Oh, now, that was close!</i>

1:00:03.854 --> 1:00:06.773
<i>That was just a practice shot,
you know, get the pace of the green.</i>

1:00:06.857 --> 1:00:09.026
<i>Yes, well, it has been raining out here,</i>

1:00:09.109 --> 1:00:11.653
<i>so it could be a little bit damp.
Couldn't it?</i>

1:00:13.030 --> 1:00:18.368
<i>Oh! Now, you feel that you should be
let back into the Open, is that right?</i>

1:00:18.452 --> 1:00:22.581
<i>Yes, an 'open' championship,
you know, should be open to everyone.</i>

1:00:22.664 --> 1:00:27.169
<i>Like the FA Cup, you know,
give the little teams a chance.</i>

1:00:27.794 --> 1:00:29.463
<i>Oh! Now, bad luck.</i>

1:00:29.546 --> 1:00:32.382
<i>I think this ground is sloping.</i>

1:00:32.883 --> 1:00:37.888
<i>Well, everybody does say
that this car park is a bit lopsided so...</i>

1:00:38.639 --> 1:00:41.099
<i>Well, I think I'd best hand
back to the studio.</i>

1:00:41.183 --> 1:00:44.311
<i>Thank you to the fantastic
Maurice Flitcroft.</i>

1:00:44.394 --> 1:00:46.230
<i>The world's worst golfer.</i>

1:00:46.313 --> 1:00:48.690
<i>No, I'm not the world's worst golfer.</i>

1:00:49.399 --> 1:00:50.859
<i>I don't agree with that.</i>

1:00:56.406 --> 1:00:57.741
Good shot, Maurice!

1:00:59.243 --> 1:01:00.744
Hey, it's really coming, innit?

1:01:01.245 --> 1:01:02.246
It's coming.

1:01:03.455 --> 1:01:06.166
"Practice is the road to perfection,"
you know.

1:01:17.469 --> 1:01:18.595
In here, love.

1:01:21.974 --> 1:01:23.183
Have I missed them?

1:01:23.267 --> 1:01:24.309
No, nothing yet.

1:01:24.935 --> 1:01:25.894
How was practice?

1:01:25.978 --> 1:01:29.147
Was great. Getting better all the time.

1:01:31.483 --> 1:01:32.317
Boys?

1:01:32.401 --> 1:01:33.443
We did it!

1:01:33.527 --> 1:01:36.154
We bloody did it! National champions!

1:01:36.655 --> 1:01:39.199
We're gonna make history.
The world final's next!

1:01:39.283 --> 1:01:40.784
Oh, well done lads!

1:01:40.868 --> 1:01:43.537
Oh! Well done!
Where are the finals, love?

1:01:43.620 --> 1:01:45.038
Freaking France!

1:01:45.122 --> 1:01:48.292
You go have fun. I love you!

1:01:50.002 --> 1:01:50.878
They're gone.

1:01:50.961 --> 1:01:54.673
There. Now shall we celebrate too?
Got some of that Babycham in the fridge.

1:01:54.756 --> 1:01:58.635
Yeah, we should celebrate.
I'll have a cup of tea, please, love.

1:01:58.719 --> 1:01:59.595
Alright, love.

1:01:59.678 --> 1:02:04.224
Have to do some more practice
later to work on me putting.

1:02:10.439 --> 1:02:11.356
Love.

1:02:13.984 --> 1:02:15.736
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1:02:17.738 --> 1:02:19.865
There was a slope in that car park.

1:02:20.574 --> 1:02:22.701
I could see it from here
on the television.

1:02:24.620 --> 1:02:25.662
No.

1:02:26.997 --> 1:02:28.624
I don't know what happened.

1:02:29.416 --> 1:02:31.210
I got a bit nervous, maybe.

1:02:32.336 --> 1:02:33.170
Love?

1:02:33.712 --> 1:02:36.632
Got a bit of me migraine.

1:02:37.591 --> 1:02:38.425
I don't know.

1:02:40.594 --> 1:02:41.470
Hey.

1:02:44.389 --> 1:02:47.976
How d'you think that
Mr. Jack Nicholson

1:02:48.060 --> 1:02:50.687
would have done, you know,
taking up the golf at 50.

1:02:50.771 --> 1:02:51.855
Jack Nicholas?

1:02:51.939 --> 1:02:55.776
Yeah. No coaching, not one lesson.

1:02:57.110 --> 1:03:00.864
And having to practice on a
beach with a bloody retriever

1:03:00.948 --> 1:03:02.282
yapping at his ankles.

1:03:02.366 --> 1:03:04.368
You think he'd have done any better?

1:03:04.451 --> 1:03:05.702
No, it's a good point, love.

1:03:05.786 --> 1:03:11.124
But they still won't let me join,
will they, so...

1:03:12.292 --> 1:03:13.877
There's no point in talking about it.

1:03:13.961 --> 1:03:14.920
That right?

1:03:15.420 --> 1:03:16.547
There's no point.

1:03:19.174 --> 1:03:20.133
All right.

1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:24.555
Well...

1:03:34.857 --> 1:03:36.567
They might not let you in, but...

1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:40.612
What about if you were to enter
as someone else?

1:03:42.072 --> 1:03:43.657
-Someone else?
-Yeah.

1:03:44.700 --> 1:03:46.618
Dashing Frenchman perhaps?

1:03:48.370 --> 1:03:49.413
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1:03:56.420 --> 1:03:58.964
Jean, you're a genius.

1:04:03.886 --> 1:04:05.053
<i>Très chic.</i>

1:04:06.221 --> 1:04:07.472
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1:04:08.682 --> 1:04:11.268
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome on the tee,</i>

1:04:11.351 --> 1:04:14.563
<i>from Paris, France, Gerard Hoppy.</i>

1:04:20.944 --> 1:04:25.449
Okay, you've got this.
Your practice has been sensational.

1:04:25.532 --> 1:04:27.075
No one'll guess it's you,

1:04:27.159 --> 1:04:29.578
so just relax and bring it home, Maurice.

1:04:29.661 --> 1:04:31.914
Right. Again, don't call me Maurice.

1:04:31.997 --> 1:04:33.081
Shit, sorry, Mol.

1:04:33.165 --> 1:04:35.709
Or Mol, I'm Gerard, Gerard Hoppy.

1:04:35.792 --> 1:04:36.835
Got you.

1:04:50.140 --> 1:04:54.186
<i>That's a nice opening drive
from the Frenchman, Gerard Hoppy.</i>

1:04:54.269 --> 1:04:57.439
<i>Unusual swing, but,
effective, it would seem.</i>

1:04:57.523 --> 1:04:58.982
Good shot, Maurice.

1:04:59.566 --> 1:05:03.487
-Gerard.
-Gerard, shit, sorry. Shot, Gerard!

1:05:16.124 --> 1:05:17.000
Yeah!

1:05:19.211 --> 1:05:22.756
And that's a steady start
for the Frenchman, Gerard Hoppy.

1:05:22.840 --> 1:05:24.925
He's parred the first two holes.

1:05:25.008 --> 1:05:28.554
I must confess I don't know
much about this fellow

1:05:28.637 --> 1:05:30.848
but he's a natty dresser,
I'll give him that.

1:05:35.477 --> 1:05:37.938
<i>This for a bogey for the Frenchman.</i>

1:05:38.772 --> 1:05:39.815
<i>And it's in!</i>

1:05:39.898 --> 1:05:42.025
<i>My goodness, he rattled that one in.</i>

1:05:46.947 --> 1:05:51.159
Who is this Gerard Hoppy?
I can't find him in the notes.

1:05:51.243 --> 1:05:53.120
Yeah, I've never heard of him either.

1:05:54.788 --> 1:05:55.789
Keep an eye on him.

1:06:02.129 --> 1:06:07.009
<i>And now, as the breeze gets up,
we join Gerard Hoppy on the tenth tee.</i>

1:06:07.593 --> 1:06:09.052
<i>Still going well.</i>

1:06:09.136 --> 1:06:14.308
<i>Still going well in his first qualifier.</i>

1:06:18.854 --> 1:06:23.775
<i>Oh! And that's-- He's tweaked that left,
and it's in the bunker.</i>

1:06:25.027 --> 1:06:27.654
Right, it's just a bunker.

1:06:27.738 --> 1:06:30.908
Just remember your practice,
you've done this loads of times, Mol.

1:06:32.576 --> 1:06:33.493
What?

1:06:33.577 --> 1:06:36.580
Oh, shit, sorry, Mol.
I mean Gerard!

1:06:36.663 --> 1:06:38.582
Gerard. Shit!

1:07:21.250 --> 1:07:22.751
Hey, what's up, Maurice?

1:07:24.211 --> 1:07:28.715
Cliff. Would you come here, please?

1:07:31.885 --> 1:07:34.429
Please, stop calling me Maurice.

1:07:34.513 --> 1:07:36.139
Oh, shit, I'm sorry, mate.

1:07:36.223 --> 1:07:38.141
-It's Mr. Mackenzie, he's spotted us.
-Where?

1:07:38.225 --> 1:07:40.018
He's up there.
No, no, no, he's behind us.

1:07:40.102 --> 1:07:42.062
Behind-- Don't look back!
Don't look back!

1:07:42.938 --> 1:07:44.398
Mr. Flitcroft.

1:07:45.315 --> 1:07:50.279
<i>Pardon, Monsieur.
Je m'appelle Gerard Hoppy,</i>

1:07:51.238 --> 1:07:52.197
<i>merci beaucoup.</i>

1:07:52.281 --> 1:07:54.116
Come on, Maurice.
I know it's you.

1:07:54.199 --> 1:07:56.660
-Hey! Stay back, pal!
-No, this doesn't concern you.

1:07:56.743 --> 1:07:58.245
Come with us, please, Maurice.

1:07:58.328 --> 1:08:00.664
Hoppy,<i> pardon, Je ne comprends pas.</i>

1:08:00.747 --> 1:08:02.499
<i>Je m'appelle </i>Gerard Hoppy.

1:08:02.583 --> 1:08:05.377
<i>J'habite en Paris, France.
</i>Just going to the tee.

1:08:05.460 --> 1:08:08.630
Mr. Flitcroft,
you look ridiculous in that wig.

1:08:08.714 --> 1:08:10.924
It's not a crime to wear a wig, is it?

1:08:11.008 --> 1:08:12.134
He's got one, look.

1:08:14.428 --> 1:08:15.345
Come on.

1:08:15.762 --> 1:08:17.430
-Alright, that's it.
-Here we go.

1:08:17.514 --> 1:08:19.933
This is Keith Mackenzie.
I need police assistance

1:08:20.017 --> 1:08:20.934
on the tenth fairway.

1:08:21.018 --> 1:08:22.853
I've got two trespassers. Over.

1:08:22.935 --> 1:08:25.606
Police? You didn't tell me
this was illegal, Maurice!

1:08:25.689 --> 1:08:27.064
The game's up, Maurice.

1:08:27.149 --> 1:08:28.984
Oh, Cliff, you berk.

1:08:29.484 --> 1:08:31.862
Right. Come on. Out of the way!

1:08:32.654 --> 1:08:34.573
Maurice! Come on!

1:08:35.198 --> 1:08:36.325
What are you doing?

1:08:36.408 --> 1:08:38.035
Come with me! Come on!

1:08:38.118 --> 1:08:40.453
I've got two trespassers
coming your way.

1:08:40.537 --> 1:08:41.537
Arrest them both!

1:08:41.955 --> 1:08:44.416
-Maurice!
-Repeat, I repeat. Arrest them both!

1:08:44.499 --> 1:08:45.459
Two trespassers.

1:08:45.542 --> 1:08:47.294
-One with a red shirt
-What are you doing?

1:08:47.377 --> 1:08:48.337
and a hat, black hair.

1:08:48.420 --> 1:08:50.296
Get in! Hop in!

1:08:50.380 --> 1:08:51.798
Hop in!

1:08:52.925 --> 1:08:56.970
<i>And now I'm hearing there's
been an altercation with an official.</i>

1:08:57.054 --> 1:09:01.642
<i>And Gerard Hoppy, the Frenchman,
I believe has commandeered a vehicle.</i>

1:09:05.645 --> 1:09:07.272
<i>Don't adjust the television,</i>

1:09:07.356 --> 1:09:11.568
<i>this isn't the Keystone Cops.
This is actually happening.</i>

1:09:11.652 --> 1:09:12.653
Oh no.

1:09:14.363 --> 1:09:17.282
What are we doing, Cliff?
We're just making it worse.

1:09:17.366 --> 1:09:18.242
Stop!

1:09:18.325 --> 1:09:20.285
I don't know, Mol, but you'll be alright.

1:09:20.911 --> 1:09:23.330
I stole the clothes.
They can't get you for that.

1:09:23.412 --> 1:09:24.665
You what? No, you--

1:09:25.249 --> 1:09:28.042
You got them from your mate,
down the market.

1:09:28.126 --> 1:09:31.421
There is no mate down the market.
I nicked them.

1:09:35.843 --> 1:09:37.261
Wait, wait! Oh!

1:09:39.805 --> 1:09:40.764
Shit.

1:09:40.848 --> 1:09:42.099
Flipping heck.

1:09:42.182 --> 1:09:43.058
Oh, Jesus.

1:09:43.140 --> 1:09:44.309
Go on, get out.

1:09:44.393 --> 1:09:45.602
I can't get caught, Mol.

1:09:48.897 --> 1:09:51.149
It's just a few clothes, Cliff.

1:09:51.233 --> 1:09:52.317
No, you don't understand.

1:09:52.943 --> 1:09:55.696
I done some things,
I done some really bad things.

1:09:55.779 --> 1:09:57.322
I can't go back inside, not now.

1:09:57.406 --> 1:09:58.907
They'll throw away the key.

1:09:59.575 --> 1:10:01.577
Jesus Christ, what am I gonna do, Mol?

1:10:03.412 --> 1:10:06.790
Run. Just go before I change my mind.

1:10:07.291 --> 1:10:09.334
I never killed anyone, though. I swear.

1:10:09.710 --> 1:10:11.712
Don't believe everything
they say about me, Mol.

1:10:12.337 --> 1:10:14.298
Gerard, I mean Gerard! Sorry!

1:10:15.257 --> 1:10:16.550
Tossers!

1:10:16.633 --> 1:10:17.926
Mr. Flitcroft, stop!

1:10:21.180 --> 1:10:22.472
Stop right there!

1:10:28.187 --> 1:10:30.230
Mr. Flitcroft, stop running!

1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:39.281
<i>Now, I am hearing news
that Mr. Gerard Hoppy is</i>

1:10:39.364 --> 1:10:41.742
<i>not in fact Gerard Hoppy.</i>

1:10:42.159 --> 1:10:46.872
<i>I'm hearing it's Maurice Flitcroft.
The so-called "Phantom of the Open."</i>

1:10:52.085 --> 1:10:53.921
You wanted to see me, Mr. Hopkins?

1:10:54.004 --> 1:10:56.632
Now, Mike.
I want to show you something.

1:10:57.049 --> 1:11:00.219
<i>This time Maurice Flitcroft,
a crane driver from Barrow,</i>

1:11:00.302 --> 1:11:02.930
<i>was arrested by police
and is being held</i>

1:11:03.013 --> 1:11:04.973
<i>at Southport police station.</i>

1:11:05.057 --> 1:11:08.185
<i>The bail has been set
at a thousand pounds.</i>

1:11:08.894 --> 1:11:10.020
<i>In other news--</i>

1:11:11.772 --> 1:11:14.775
We are in the middle of trying
to secure the Trident deal.

1:11:15.901 --> 1:11:19.279
And we got your dad running around
taking the piss out of me.

1:11:19.363 --> 1:11:20.948
I wouldn't take it personally, sir.

1:11:21.490 --> 1:11:22.658
Gerard Hoppy?

1:11:23.992 --> 1:11:25.953
Yeah, well, I can see
what you mean but--

1:11:26.036 --> 1:11:28.747
We provide you with
a nice life here, Mike.

1:11:29.581 --> 1:11:34.002
Nice clothes, nice house, nice car.

1:11:35.254 --> 1:11:37.756
Not bad for a little bastard
from Bankside, eh?

1:11:39.675 --> 1:11:41.385
You gotta decide, Mike.

1:11:42.886 --> 1:11:45.639
You're either his sort or you're our sort.

1:11:45.722 --> 1:11:47.432
You can't be both.

1:12:10.873 --> 1:12:12.708
Mike! Mike!

1:12:12.791 --> 1:12:14.042
No need to shout, Maurice.

1:12:14.126 --> 1:12:14.960
No, I'm not.

1:12:15.919 --> 1:12:18.046
Thanks, son!
I'll pay you back straight away.

1:12:18.130 --> 1:12:19.298
Don't worry about it, Dad.

1:12:22.217 --> 1:12:23.260
Road sweeper.

1:12:24.303 --> 1:12:25.304
Is that it?

1:12:25.804 --> 1:12:30.184
Your options are limited.
Partly because of the incident.

1:12:31.518 --> 1:12:32.477
I'm sorry.

1:12:37.357 --> 1:12:40.152
Those are unusual flowers,
you grow them yourself?

1:12:40.819 --> 1:12:43.989
No, I picked them on the way in.
I shouldn't really, but...

1:12:44.573 --> 1:12:48.660
No, you should.
Pick all the flowers you can,

1:12:49.620 --> 1:12:51.163
while you're still young.

1:13:21.610 --> 1:13:22.611
Oi, Maurice!

1:13:22.694 --> 1:13:26.907
Get back on that course!
Don't let the bastards get you down!

1:13:37.501 --> 1:13:39.336
<i>...Middlesex beat champions Yorkshire.</i>

1:13:39.419 --> 1:13:41.046
<i>And there were wins for Somerset,</i>

1:13:41.129 --> 1:13:43.173
<i>Surrey, and for Lancashire

<i>Maurice Flitcroft,</i>

<i>That's the news this evening.
From all of us here, goodnight.</i>

1:14:10.242 --> 1:14:11.660
Oh, smells nice.

1:14:12.828 --> 1:14:14.872
Got another postcard from the boys, look.

1:14:20.377 --> 1:14:23.088
Look at that. Mochbar.

1:14:23.172 --> 1:14:24.089
Moscow.

1:14:24.173 --> 1:14:27.176
Moscow. Look at that.

1:14:30.554 --> 1:14:33.599
Dancing round the globe,
drinking a lot of vodka.

1:14:36.268 --> 1:14:37.269
Lovely.

1:14:39.980 --> 1:14:41.148
Moscow!

1:14:41.773 --> 1:14:44.193
Postmark was from two months ago, mind.

1:14:44.276 --> 1:14:45.485
Two months ago?

1:14:47.154 --> 1:14:49.156
What they been doing since then, I wonder?

1:14:49.239 --> 1:14:50.282
Don't know.

1:14:52.367 --> 1:14:53.535
Great!

1:14:55.537 --> 1:14:56.580
That's it then.

1:14:58.248 --> 1:14:59.249
Unbelievable.

1:15:00.459 --> 1:15:03.837
We really do enjoy our work here.
I mean, we've been building the brand for,

1:15:03.921 --> 1:15:05.839
well, 15, 20 years and it--

1:15:05.923 --> 1:15:07.132
-We do think it's--
-Oi!

1:15:07.883 --> 1:15:08.759
Hey, up!

1:15:08.842 --> 1:15:10.219
-Who are they?
-Mr. Mustache.

1:15:10.302 --> 1:15:11.595
They're just...

1:15:11.678 --> 1:15:13.263
Don't worry, we don't know them.

1:15:13.347 --> 1:15:15.140
-If you just keep coming with us.
-Michael!

1:15:15.516 --> 1:15:17.226
-Keep, keep on coming.
-Mike!

1:15:17.851 --> 1:15:19.353
-Excuse us. Excuse us.
-Michael?

1:15:20.354 --> 1:15:21.647
Who are these people?

1:15:21.730 --> 1:15:22.898
Well, they're my brothers.

1:15:22.981 --> 1:15:24.816
You're joking? You get rid of them.

1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:25.817
Yeah, I will.

1:15:25.901 --> 1:15:28.987
-Make it back for the dinner, right?
-I know, I'll get rid of them quick.

1:15:29.071 --> 1:15:30.322
Sorry, one second.

1:15:31.240 --> 1:15:33.742
Mike works at a homeless
charity part time,

1:15:33.825 --> 1:15:35.911
he's just-- Just a couple of escapees.

1:15:35.994 --> 1:15:37.829
-Oh, I see.
-He'll be back in a minute.

1:15:37.913 --> 1:15:40.040
-What you playing at?
-What are you two doing here?

1:15:41.667 --> 1:15:43.669
We went to the house
but there was nobody there.

1:15:43.752 --> 1:15:44.962
Yeah, they had to move out.

1:15:45.045 --> 1:15:45.879
Move out?

1:15:45.963 --> 1:15:47.089
Yeah, it's not been great.

1:15:47.172 --> 1:15:48.799
-Can we crash with you?
-No, you can't.

1:15:48.882 --> 1:15:50.759
-Where we supposed to stay?
-I'll show you.

1:15:50.843 --> 1:15:52.845
What are we supposed to do?
We've nowhere to go.

1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:09.778
It's the boys, Jean!

1:16:09.862 --> 1:16:11.822
-These are yours, I believe.
-Come in, lads!

1:16:11.905 --> 1:16:12.906
Why you in a caravan?

1:16:12.990 --> 1:16:16.243
Blimey, the whole family
back together, would you believe it?

1:16:16.326 --> 1:16:17.661
I'll put heater on.

1:16:19.663 --> 1:16:20.998
You wanna sit down, love?

1:16:21.081 --> 1:16:22.499
-You alright?
-It's fine.

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:26.420
Well, what happened?
We thought you were on tour, loves.

1:16:26.503 --> 1:16:27.671
It got canceled.

1:16:27.754 --> 1:16:30.215
-Canceled?
-Yeah, crowds got less and less.

1:16:30.299 --> 1:16:31.133
No one turned up.

1:16:31.216 --> 1:16:33.844
Yeah, it was like one minute
disco were alive,

1:16:33.927 --> 1:16:35.262
the next it were dead.

1:16:35.345 --> 1:16:40.559
Well, that's just, you know,
circle of life sometimes, boys.

1:16:45.522 --> 1:16:46.857
Is that all you've got to say?

1:16:48.233 --> 1:16:50.485
Well, what do you expect
us to say, Michael?

1:16:50.986 --> 1:16:52.446
Well, how about sorry?

1:16:54.323 --> 1:16:55.282
For what?

1:16:55.782 --> 1:16:58.035
Well, you should have made
them get proper jobs.

1:16:58.452 --> 1:17:01.246
Well, they're living the dream.

1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:03.999
There's naught wrong with that.

1:17:04.416 --> 1:17:06.084
Well, it depends what the dream is.

1:17:06.168 --> 1:17:07.586
They're world champions!

1:17:07.669 --> 1:17:10.088
At what? Disco dancing?

1:17:10.714 --> 1:17:12.883
They may as well be world
champions at tiddlywinks.

1:17:12.966 --> 1:17:14.218
Look at the state of them.

1:17:14.301 --> 1:17:16.553
"The Fantastic Flitcrofts"?

1:17:16.637 --> 1:17:18.597
The fantastic failures more like.

1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:20.224
They aimed for the stars.

1:17:20.807 --> 1:17:23.143
Yeah, and now they're in the gutter.

1:17:24.228 --> 1:17:25.229
Mike's right.

1:17:25.896 --> 1:17:28.899
Maybe if we'd had a different dad,
we'd have done better and all.

1:17:29.399 --> 1:17:32.277
Reckon our dancing's about
as useful as your golf, Dad.

1:17:32.945 --> 1:17:33.779
Boys.

1:17:53.465 --> 1:17:54.925
Maurice, what are you doing?

1:17:55.968 --> 1:17:57.427
You alright? Love?

1:18:01.473 --> 1:18:02.808
Love, where you going?

1:18:04.643 --> 1:18:06.144
Just going out for a moment.

1:18:09.231 --> 1:18:10.190
I'm alright.

1:18:23.787 --> 1:18:24.746
Right.

1:18:26.707 --> 1:18:30.043
You go and apologize to your dad.
Now, please.

1:18:31.170 --> 1:18:32.921
But he's not my dad though, is he?

1:18:36.091 --> 1:18:39.553
How can you stand there and say that...

1:18:41.180 --> 1:18:43.056
after all that he's done for you?

1:18:43.140 --> 1:18:44.683
Hey, no, no.
Everything I've done,

1:18:44.766 --> 1:18:45.684
I've done myself.

1:18:46.101 --> 1:18:47.811
He wanted me to be a flipping astronaut!

1:18:49.146 --> 1:18:50.689
He's made your life a misery.

1:18:53.567 --> 1:18:54.568
Enough.

1:19:09.416 --> 1:19:11.043
<i>When I was 17...</i>

1:19:12.711 --> 1:19:13.629
<i>I got...</i>

1:19:14.796 --> 1:19:18.133
offered a job to join a theater company.

1:19:19.218 --> 1:19:21.136
Seven pound 50 a week.

1:19:24.473 --> 1:19:26.099
Dream come true.

1:19:26.183 --> 1:19:28.435
Whole life set up for me.

1:19:31.396 --> 1:19:32.314
What happened?

1:19:33.857 --> 1:19:35.359
I got pregnant.

1:19:39.947 --> 1:19:43.742
I wanted to keep you, Michael.
No question in my mind about that.

1:19:44.743 --> 1:19:45.827
But...

1:19:47.829 --> 1:19:49.414
nobody supported me.

1:19:50.123 --> 1:19:52.918
Not my father, not my mother.

1:19:54.002 --> 1:19:55.003
Not my friends.

1:19:57.089 --> 1:19:59.591
I trained as a secretary off my own back.

1:20:00.217 --> 1:20:03.095
Set up the little theater by myself.

1:20:06.265 --> 1:20:08.725
I brought you up by myself.

1:20:12.145 --> 1:20:15.607
Not a soul stood by my side
for a single second.

1:20:19.027 --> 1:20:20.904
And then I met your father.

1:20:41.300 --> 1:20:43.886
So don't you tell me
he's made my life a misery.

1:20:46.847 --> 1:20:48.098
He's made my life.

1:20:49.641 --> 1:20:51.059
He's made all our lives.

1:20:56.648 --> 1:20:57.482
Now...

1:21:00.611 --> 1:21:02.070
I'm going out there...

1:21:04.448 --> 1:21:05.657
to look for him.

1:21:07.075 --> 1:21:10.245
And I suggest you come and help me.

1:21:12.164 --> 1:21:14.208
I can't, Mom. I've got a dinner that--

1:21:14.291 --> 1:21:17.044
Oh, okay, Michael.
Well, never mind, it's your life.

1:21:17.127 --> 1:21:18.378
Come on now, boys.

1:23:25.380 --> 1:23:26.381
Maurice?

1:23:27.382 --> 1:23:28.300
Maurice?

1:23:30.928 --> 1:23:31.845
Jean?

1:23:32.846 --> 1:23:34.056
You all right, Pam?

1:23:34.139 --> 1:23:36.642
Hey, you've not seen Maurice, have you?

1:23:36.725 --> 1:23:37.726
-No.
-No.

1:23:37.809 --> 1:23:40.687
But here, I've got some post for you.

1:23:42.272 --> 1:23:43.482
Thanks.

1:23:43.565 --> 1:23:44.608
Be bills.

1:23:52.032 --> 1:23:54.243
Postmark from America, look.

1:24:01.875 --> 1:24:02.960
Willie, look at this.

1:24:05.420 --> 1:24:06.338
Bloody hell.

1:24:07.005 --> 1:24:08.340
Come on, we've gotta find him.

1:24:09.174 --> 1:24:10.133
Thanks, Pam!

1:24:10.217 --> 1:24:11.385
Dad?

1:24:11.468 --> 1:24:13.053
-Maurice?
-Dad?

1:24:14.096 --> 1:24:15.514
-Dad?
-Maurice?

1:24:16.598 --> 1:24:18.433
-Mol?
-Maurice?

1:24:19.268 --> 1:24:20.769
-Mol?
-Dad?

1:24:23.564 --> 1:24:25.148
There you are, look. There he is.

1:24:26.650 --> 1:24:28.569
-We're sorry, Dad!
-Yeah!

1:24:28.652 --> 1:24:31.280
We're really, really sorry!

1:24:31.905 --> 1:24:33.323
Come down, love.

1:24:33.407 --> 1:24:35.576
They didn't mean it. None of them.

1:24:37.578 --> 1:24:38.704
No!

1:24:40.539 --> 1:24:42.082
They were right!

1:24:43.917 --> 1:24:46.211
The world's not an oyster.

1:24:47.379 --> 1:24:49.298
It's just a barnacle.

1:24:50.883 --> 1:24:52.551
I see that now.

1:24:53.969 --> 1:24:57.014
What are you talking about,
you bloody fool?

1:24:57.681 --> 1:25:00.851
I raised your hopes too high, lads.

1:25:01.852 --> 1:25:02.936
I'm sorry.

1:25:04.438 --> 1:25:07.858
I should have known.
I were just letting you down.

1:25:08.942 --> 1:25:10.986
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1:25:11.695 --> 1:25:13.864
Why don't you come down and read this?

1:25:14.489 --> 1:25:16.700
We've got a plane to catch.

1:25:17.868 --> 1:25:21.121
<i>Dear Mr. Flitcroft,
my name is Terry Moore,</i>

1:25:21.205 --> 1:25:23.749
<i>and I am writing to you
from Grand Rapids, Michigan.</i>

1:25:23.832 --> 1:25:26.752
<i>You won't be aware of this,
but for ten years now,</i>

1:25:26.835 --> 1:25:30.297
<i>we've held the Maurice Flitcroft
Trophy in your honor.</i>

1:25:43.143 --> 1:25:45.187
<i>It's a day when the members
bring their families,</i>

1:25:45.270 --> 1:25:48.065
<i>-and the worst score wins, not the best.
-Go.</i>

1:25:49.399 --> 1:25:52.528
<i>Such is the affection that our members
have towards you and the trophy,</i>

1:25:53.195 --> 1:25:55.405
<i>we would like to invite you

1:25:55.489 --> 1:25:57.783
<i>for the ten year anniversary
of the competition.</i>

1:25:59.535 --> 1:26:02.788
Sorry, Mr. Flitcroft said
he's not to be disturbed.

1:26:02.871 --> 1:26:07.918
Oh, all right. Well, just make sure
that he gets this, all right?

1:26:08.460 --> 1:26:10.254
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

1:26:23.016 --> 1:26:25.477
<i>We'd like to offer you
and your family first class tickets,</i>

1:26:25.561 --> 1:26:29.314
<i>hotel accommodation

1:26:30.148 --> 1:26:32.109
<i>Maurice, we hope
you'll accept our invitation</i>

1:26:32.192 --> 1:26:33.986
<i>and that you have a pleasant flight here.</i>

1:26:34.069 --> 1:26:35.445
<i>Yours, Terry Moore,</i>

1:26:35.529 --> 1:26:38.407
<i>president, Blythefield Country Club,
Grand Rapids, Michigan.</i>

1:27:03.432 --> 1:27:05.142
Maurice, I'm Terry Moore.

1:27:05.225 --> 1:27:06.226
Oh, hello, Terry.

1:27:06.310 --> 1:27:08.437
So glad you could make it over.
Welcome to America.

1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:10.981
Pleased to meet you.
Thanks very much for having us over.

1:27:29.041 --> 1:27:31.543
What-- What you doing?
We're not finished.

1:27:32.294 --> 1:27:34.713
I thought she was taking it away.
It's almost full. Sorry.

1:27:52.397 --> 1:27:54.525
Flitcroft, it's showtime.

1:27:55.067 --> 1:27:56.109
Okay, stay calm.

1:27:58.529 --> 1:28:00.864
To my office please. Thank you.

1:28:00.948 --> 1:28:02.783
Mike, come on.

1:28:06.203 --> 1:28:07.246
Mike.

1:28:14.837 --> 1:28:17.965
<i>Finally, the moment
we've all been waiting for.</i>

1:28:18.048 --> 1:28:21.677
<i>Maurice Flitcroft
will tee off at his own tournament</i>

1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:23.637
<i>here at Grand Rapids.</i>

1:28:38.694 --> 1:28:41.989
Thank you, Mr. Flitcroft.
You have given us much to think about.

1:28:42.072 --> 1:28:43.824
Excuse us a moment.

1:28:51.456 --> 1:28:53.083
Excuse me, Mr. Flitcroft.

1:28:53.166 --> 1:28:54.877
We have just one question more.

1:28:55.419 --> 1:28:58.797
We were just wondering,
are you related, by any chance,

1:28:58.881 --> 1:29:02.134
to Maurice Flitcroft, the crazy golfer?

1:29:03.552 --> 1:29:05.095
No, no, no.

1:29:06.013 --> 1:29:09.266
It's a-- That's a really common name
around these parts.

1:29:09.349 --> 1:29:11.351
He has nothing to do with Michael.

1:29:11.435 --> 1:29:13.395
He's a different class of person.

1:29:19.276 --> 1:29:21.403
Yes. I am.

1:29:22.613 --> 1:29:23.655
He's my father.

1:29:24.573 --> 1:29:26.783
Maurice Flitcroft is my dad.

1:29:34.625 --> 1:29:36.001
An honor to meet you.

1:29:37.461 --> 1:29:38.879
We are big fan of your father.

1:29:38.962 --> 1:29:41.715
He's the only golfer
who's worse than my boss.

1:29:44.384 --> 1:29:47.179
Yeah. Well, we're all big fans
of Maurice 'round here.

1:29:47.262 --> 1:29:50.057
He used to work here, don't you know, eh?

1:29:50.140 --> 1:29:53.018
Can we meet your father?
Would he play golf with us?

1:29:54.269 --> 1:29:56.355
Yeah, I think he'd like that a lot.

1:29:57.189 --> 1:29:58.273
Great.

1:30:01.026 --> 1:30:03.111
<i>What a great opening drive.</i>

1:30:03.195 --> 1:30:05.405
<i>220 yards, straight down the middle.</i>

1:30:06.114 --> 1:30:08.283
<i>Have they got the real Maurice Flitcroft?</i>

1:30:12.204 --> 1:30:13.288
<i>Sorry!</i>

1:30:15.415 --> 1:30:17.209
<i>No, I think that's him.</i>

1:30:18.669 --> 1:30:19.503
<i>You okay?</i>

1:30:48.782 --> 1:30:52.411
-We're staying here, brother. Yeah.
-Read my mind, mate. Read my mind.

1:30:58.625 --> 1:30:59.751
Great dancers.

1:31:02.921 --> 1:31:05.465
You see, I'd just thrown away
the junior club championship

1:31:05.549 --> 1:31:07.384
with a three putt from 15 feet.

1:31:08.177 --> 1:31:12.306
I went home, and I said to my dad,
"That's it, I'm giving up golf."

1:31:12.848 --> 1:31:15.684
I went to my room, switched on the TV,

1:31:15.767 --> 1:31:19.438
and saw Maurice Flitcroft
hit four putts from 10 feet.

1:31:19.980 --> 1:31:23.442
I went downstairs, and I said to my dad,
"I take it back. Maybe it wasn't so bad."

1:31:25.402 --> 1:31:28.947
Next year, I'll be playing
at the U.S. Masters in Augusta

1:31:29.031 --> 1:31:31.950
for winning the U.S. Amateur Championship.

1:31:32.618 --> 1:31:36.246
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you, Maurice Flitcroft.

1:32:03.607 --> 1:32:06.193
"Practice is the road to perfection."

1:32:10.155 --> 1:32:12.115
-Wonderful speech.
-Thank you.

1:32:21.250 --> 1:32:22.084
So...

1:32:25.128 --> 1:32:25.963
go--

1:32:26.713 --> 1:32:31.844
Golf is a game where you can
play well and score poorly,

1:32:31.927 --> 1:32:34.346
or play poorly and score well.

1:32:34.429 --> 1:32:38.100
But-- But my game was never like that.

1:32:39.560 --> 1:32:43.355
I-- I played poorly,
and I scored poorly as well.

1:32:45.274 --> 1:32:49.945
But if I can inspire just one person,
like this very talented young man,

1:32:50.028 --> 1:32:52.239
well, that's a hole in one, isn't it?

1:32:52.322 --> 1:32:54.825
That makes the whole thing worthwhile.
Good luck to you.

1:32:56.702 --> 1:32:58.412
And keep practicing.

1:32:59.496 --> 1:33:00.664
Good luck to you.

1:33:21.185 --> 1:33:22.019
So...

1:33:23.687 --> 1:33:24.521
thank you.

1:33:25.647 --> 1:33:30.319
I'd like to thank Terry Moore
and all the members of the club

1:33:30.402 --> 1:33:33.071
paying an enormous
amount of money, I expect,

1:33:33.155 --> 1:33:37.326
to bring Jean and I and the family
over here for this week.

1:33:37.409 --> 1:33:41.038
But whatever you paid,
the airline still lost all our luggage,

1:33:41.121 --> 1:33:44.249
so thanks for the clothes as well.

1:33:46.335 --> 1:33:49.630
Well, there's so many people
I want to thank while I'm up here.

1:33:50.714 --> 1:33:56.637
I'd like to thank my sons,
James and Gene, the Fantastic Flitcrofts,

1:33:56.720 --> 1:33:59.932
who you saw dancing
on the floor a little while ago.

1:34:00.015 --> 1:34:03.101
And I'd like to thank my son Mike.

1:34:03.185 --> 1:34:06.563
And I'd like to thank Lloyd Donovan,

1:34:07.481 --> 1:34:10.776
a journalist who's been
documenting my ups and downs.

1:34:10.859 --> 1:34:15.781
But there's one person that
I've never thanked publicly.

1:34:16.823 --> 1:34:21.453
I don't-- Actually, I don't think
I've ever even thanked her privately.

1:34:22.204 --> 1:34:25.832
So tonight, I'd very much like
to thank me wife, Jean.

1:34:28.669 --> 1:34:31.505
If life were a cup of tea,

1:34:32.047 --> 1:34:33.841
my Jean is the sugar.

1:34:34.550 --> 1:34:37.135
Without it, it's unbearable,
just chuck it away.

1:34:37.219 --> 1:34:39.638
But with it, it's like--

1:34:39.721 --> 1:34:41.890
It's like heaven on earth.

1:34:43.308 --> 1:34:45.769
She's a magician, she is.

1:34:45.853 --> 1:34:47.354
She's a magician.

1:34:47.437 --> 1:34:49.273
She's the light of my life,

1:34:49.773 --> 1:34:53.193
and I don't know how I'd cope without her.

1:34:54.945 --> 1:34:56.738
I love her very, very much.

1:35:04.705 --> 1:35:06.039
To Jean.

1:35:55.088 --> 1:35:56.548
-Ta, Dad.
-Ta.

1:35:57.132 --> 1:35:58.383
That's caviar, there.

1:36:00.302 --> 1:36:01.136
Maurice.

1:36:01.845 --> 1:36:03.847
-Champagne and caviar?
-Yeah.

1:36:03.931 --> 1:36:05.140
Travel the world?

1:36:05.224 --> 1:36:08.644
-Yeah, travel the world, like I said.
-Yeah, just like you promised.

1:36:09.186 --> 1:36:12.147
Shame about the diamonds,
but there you go. I'll forgive you that.

1:36:12.231 --> 1:36:14.149
Oh, that is a shame. Wait a minute.

1:36:14.233 --> 1:36:17.486
My heart. Oh, Jean, it's rattling some.

1:36:17.569 --> 1:36:18.737
My old heart.

1:36:19.738 --> 1:36:21.532
Well, what's that?

1:36:21.615 --> 1:36:22.741
What have you done?

1:36:24.326 --> 1:36:26.161
-Oh, Maurice...
-Come right out of my heart.

1:36:34.127 --> 1:36:35.796
Where'd you get that?

1:36:36.672 --> 1:36:39.466
Cliff sent it me from his mate
down the market.

1:36:40.092 --> 1:36:43.345
So maybe don't wear it in public.

1:36:43.846 --> 1:36:45.681
It's beautiful. Thank you.

1:36:49.852 --> 1:36:51.770
-I meant it.
-I know.

1:36:51.854 --> 1:36:52.813
Thank you.

1:37:04.908 --> 1:37:06.618
So, Maurice,

1:37:07.244 --> 1:37:10.497
any more goals,
as far as golf is concerned?

1:37:11.623 --> 1:37:14.751
Well, maybe
Sports Personality of the Year.

1:37:15.294 --> 1:37:17.337
I'm surprised
I haven't been nominated for that.

1:37:17.421 --> 1:37:20.674
There's something going on there.
There's a conspiracy against me.

1:37:20.757 --> 1:37:23.260
-It's kind of not fair, is it?
-No, it's sport.

1:37:23.886 --> 1:37:25.512
It's all about sport, isn't it?

1:37:25.596 --> 1:37:30.058
I mean, for every winner of a tournament,
there's 149 losers.

1:37:32.186 --> 1:37:34.479
Well, that's a wonderful way
to leave the interview.

1:37:34.563 --> 1:37:35.647
Thanks.

1:37:37.232 --> 1:37:38.901
Maurice Flitcroft,

1:37:38.984 --> 1:37:41.778
the Phantom of the Open, thank you.

1:37:41.862 --> 1:37:42.988
Thank you.

1:37:48.368 --> 1:37:49.203
And cut.

1:37:50.078 --> 1:37:51.205
Thank you, Maurice.

1:37:51.830 --> 1:37:53.457
Will I get my tea, now?

1:37:53.540 --> 1:37:55.209
Oh, my gosh, I forgot.

1:37:55.292 --> 1:37:57.336
Can someone get Maurice his tea?

1:37:57.419 --> 1:37:59.254
-I'll get it right away.
-Was it six sugars?

1:37:59.338 --> 1:38:00.214
Six.

1:38:00.797 --> 1:38:03.300
You know,
a lot of pros here in the States,

1:38:03.383 --> 1:38:05.677
they get invited to play in the Open
and they don't go.

1:38:06.428 --> 1:38:07.304
Why not?

1:38:07.971 --> 1:38:11.517
Well, it's a long way, it's expensive.

1:38:12.559 --> 1:38:15.604
I got a buddy who's a pro,
up in Frenchmen's Creek in Florida,

1:38:15.687 --> 1:38:18.690
and he's not going because
he doesn't like the weather in Scotland.

1:38:19.483 --> 1:38:20.984
Can you believe that?

1:38:21.068 --> 1:38:22.819
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

1:38:24.446 --> 1:38:25.656
What's his name?

1:38:48.178 --> 1:38:52.349
<i>Welcome, once again, to the first round
of qualifying for the British Open.</i>

1:38:52.432 --> 1:38:55.185
<i>We got players here
from all round the world.</i>

1:38:55.686 --> 1:38:57.688
<i>They've got Japanese, Australians,</i>

1:38:57.771 --> 1:39:00.607
<i>players from France,
Germany, Spain, you name it.</i>

1:39:00.691 --> 1:39:02.901
<i>A very smooth-looking
American there, I think.</i>

1:39:05.737 --> 1:39:11.869
<i>All coming to our little island, hoping to
end up lifting that famous Claret Jug.</i>

1:39:13.662 --> 1:39:15.789
<i>Greenkeepers have been out in force today.</i>

1:39:15.873 --> 1:39:18.083
<i>The course is looking spectacular.</i>

1:39:18.166 --> 1:39:20.294
<i>So without further ado,</i>

1:39:20.377 --> 1:39:22.546
<i>let's get out on the course.</i>

1:39:23.755 --> 1:39:28.343
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome on the tee,</i>

1:39:28.427 --> 1:39:31.013
<i>from Frenchman's Creek, Florida,</i>

1:39:31.513 --> 1:39:33.682
Gene Pachecki.

1:39:41.356 --> 1:39:43.525
Come on, come on, come on.

1:39:44.193 --> 1:39:45.360
Jesus, come on.

1:39:53.368 --> 1:39:55.162
Isn't that Maurice Flitcroft?

1:40:45.671 --> 1:40:48.006
<i>Well, Blythefield Country Club
is in the midst of</i>

1:40:48.090 --> 1:40:51.385
<i>its 10th annual Flitcroft
member-guest golf tournament,</i>

1:40:51.468 --> 1:40:53.804
<i>an event named after Maurice Flitcroft.</i>

1:40:53.887 --> 1:40:57.015
<i>Maurice Flitcroft,
a crane driver from Barrow--</i>

1:40:57.099 --> 1:40:58.267
<i>Do you wanna go on?</i>

1:40:58.350 --> 1:41:00.644
<i>Are you looking, maybe,
at the Hall of Fame?</i>

1:41:01.353 --> 1:41:03.438
<i>The Hall of Fame, and back home,</i>

1:41:03.522 --> 1:41:05.482
<i>maybe Sportsman of the Year.</i>

1:41:05.566 --> 1:41:09.027
<i>You know, I'm surprised I've not
been invited or nominated for that,</i>

1:41:09.111 --> 1:41:11.280
<i>Sports Personality of the Year.</i>

1:41:11.363 --> 1:41:13.448
<i>I mean, you know,
there's something going on.</i>

1:41:13.532 --> 1:41:16.201
<i>You know, there's a conspiracy
being waged against me.</i>

1:41:26.628 --> 1:41:29.047
<i>Just to explain to those
who don't know much about golf,</i>

1:41:29.131 --> 1:41:31.133
<i>what you're gonna do now,
is you're gonna putt,</i>

1:41:31.216 --> 1:41:33.802
<i>as if you were on a green,
you're gonna aim for this thing.</i>

1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:36.263
<i>This is quite dramatic, isn't it?</i>

1:41:39.308 --> 1:41:41.143
<i>-Oh, that was a nearly.
-Ah, not quite.</i>

1:41:41.226 --> 1:41:44.521
<i>A lot of pressure. You shouldn't speak
when a golfer's about to putt, should I?</i>

1:41:44.605 --> 1:41:45.898
<i>-No, you shouldn't.
-Oh, sorry.</i>

1:41:45.981 --> 1:41:48.775
<i>You need a few practice shots
to get used to the pace of the green.</i>

1:41:50.819 --> 1:41:52.404
<i>This is not going too well, is it?</i>

1:41:52.487 --> 1:41:54.323
<i>No, I think this floor's sloping.</i>

1:42:09.922 --> 1:42:15.177
<i>You know, a man of your stature
and your competence on a golf course,</i>

1:42:15.260 --> 1:42:19.348
<i>we can't leave you without
some tips for duffers, like myself.</i>

1:42:19.431 --> 1:42:21.683
<i>Person picking up
a golf club for the first time,</i>

1:42:21.767 --> 1:42:23.310
<i>what would be your advice?</i>

1:42:25.020 --> 1:42:26.688
<i>My advice? Well...</i>

1:42:29.608 --> 1:42:30.567
<i>practice.</i>

1:42:31.193 --> 1:42:32.986
<i>That is the road to perfection.</i>

1:42:33.070 --> 1:42:34.571
<i>Regular practice.</i>
