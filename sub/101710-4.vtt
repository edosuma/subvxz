WEBVTT

00:09.660 --> 00:11.445
Hey, you guys ever read
the back of the menu here?

00:11.489 --> 00:13.664
It's the story of
the Burgundy Bistro.

00:13.708 --> 00:16.972
Yeah, started in 1959by Tom Burgundy.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.452
Wait, that's somebody's name?

00:18.495 --> 00:19.628
I thought it wasjust called that

00:19.670 --> 00:21.978
to remind uswe can't order wine.

00:22.021 --> 00:24.067
I thought it was the
color of the awning.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.068
Burgundys all look miserable.

00:26.112 --> 00:27.330
It's an old picture.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.289
They probably had
to stand real still

00:29.332 --> 00:31.987
in order for it to stick.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.468
It was 1959.

00:33.511 --> 00:37.036
We had TV, cars,women wore pants.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.863
Well, the Burgundys all looklike they just smelled

00:38.908 --> 00:40.301
something bad.

00:40.344 --> 00:43.652
In olden times,people didn't shower for months.

00:43.695 --> 00:46.002
It was 1959.

00:46.045 --> 00:48.396
We had astronauts.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.615
Toot, toot!
Make way for the love train.

00:50.658 --> 00:52.268
[chuckles]
Hey, everybody.

00:52.313 --> 00:53.966
Hi.Hi.
I'm gonna give you

00:54.009 --> 00:56.229
a very good rating on the app.

00:56.273 --> 00:57.491
Oh, God.

00:57.534 --> 00:58.667
[groans]

00:58.710 --> 01:00.451
And release.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.973
[exhales] Hey, Jill,can we bring anything tonight...

01:02.018 --> 01:03.106
[gasps][Jill shushes]

01:03.149 --> 01:05.108
Not everyone was invited.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.022
Relax. We all know
you guys are having

01:07.067 --> 01:09.765
a secret double date
tonight, and no one cares.

01:09.807 --> 01:11.245
I didn't know.

01:11.287 --> 01:12.897
I kind of care.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.248
Okay, well, see you later.

01:14.290 --> 01:16.162
Well, not all of you. Damn it.

01:17.164 --> 01:19.209
It's not that it was a secret,

01:19.253 --> 01:21.429
it's just that we'rein relationships

01:21.472 --> 01:25.781
and I wanted to be sensitive andnot rub it in your lonely faces.

01:25.823 --> 01:27.783
Thank you.

01:28.826 --> 01:30.829
I'm in more than a relationship.

01:30.873 --> 01:33.093
Adam and I are in love
on a whole new level.

01:33.135 --> 01:36.139
We're above love,
looking down on it thinking,

01:36.182 --> 01:38.706
"Remember when our love was new
and we thought we had it all?"

01:38.750 --> 01:40.621
Now it's so much deeper.

01:40.664 --> 01:42.276
It's higher and deeper.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.841
And I'm sorry,
I'm going on and on.

01:43.885 --> 01:45.365
Marjorie, how are the cats?

01:47.367 --> 01:48.978
Two of them have
eye infections.

01:49.021 --> 01:50.326
Actually, it's three now.

01:50.371 --> 01:54.026
I warned Simonto stay away from Garfunkel.

01:54.069 --> 01:56.377
Tammy, can you stopand get a new tube of ointment?

01:56.420 --> 01:58.901
No can do. Chef Rudy's rolling
out his new food truck tonight,

01:58.944 --> 02:00.293
and he needs me to
check to make sure

02:00.337 --> 02:01.947
it's up and running smoothly.

02:01.990 --> 02:05.125
How do you go from a Michelinstar restaurant to a food truck?

02:05.168 --> 02:08.301
Alcohol, drugs and a
lot of missing veal.

02:08.344 --> 02:09.693
[laughter]

02:09.737 --> 02:11.740
I got to say, though,
it's a pretty sweet truck.

02:11.782 --> 02:13.655
Used to be
Pita Piper's Kabob Wagon,

02:13.698 --> 02:16.048
but I gave her a full rebuild.

02:16.091 --> 02:18.268
So, how was it workingwith your old boyfriend?

02:18.312 --> 02:20.356
You two test outthe shock absorbers?

02:20.401 --> 02:22.576
Oh, no. Chef Rudy's
the kind of mistake

02:22.620 --> 02:24.144
you only make three times.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.841
I set some ground rules.

02:26.884 --> 02:28.626
He's not allowed
to look at me or touch me

02:28.670 --> 02:32.239
or think about me, but
that one's harder to enforce.

02:32.281 --> 02:33.587
[phone chimes]

02:33.631 --> 02:37.418
Aw, it's Adam. He
misses me already.

02:37.461 --> 02:41.812
"Higher and deeper."

02:43.771 --> 02:46.252
Your hate only makes
it more beautiful.

02:48.254 --> 02:50.257
â™ª

03:18.633 --> 03:20.417
Toot, toot!

03:20.461 --> 03:22.376
[chuckles]We thought we'd try this again

03:22.419 --> 03:24.159
around people
who appreciate love.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.247
Hey.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.250
Hey. What up?

03:27.294 --> 03:29.599
I'll tell you what
up: homemade flan.

03:29.644 --> 03:31.993
It's my first timewith this recipe, so be gentle.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.603
Oh, babe, it's
gonna be delicious.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.780
Just like you.Mmm.

03:35.824 --> 03:37.173
Why don't you just
put that over there

03:37.216 --> 03:39.697
next to Andy's big pile
of fat trimmings?

03:40.959 --> 03:42.569
Yeah, you yell at me
if I leave it on,

03:42.612 --> 03:44.527
you yell at me if I trim it off.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.183
I'm gonna get up.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.186
Uh-huh.
[clears throat]

03:50.229 --> 03:51.840
So, where can I be of use?

03:51.883 --> 03:54.103
Ah, you can help mefinish setting the table.

03:54.146 --> 03:56.974
Andy just dumped the sterling
in a pile like we're in prison.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.456
[stifled laugh]
Aren't we?

04:00.501 --> 04:02.067
What are you cooking?

04:02.110 --> 04:03.938
Oh, I'm gonna reverse-sear
a couple of tri-tips,

04:03.981 --> 04:06.942
and then this itty-bitty
piece of salmon is for Jill.

04:06.985 --> 04:09.813
Hmm. You'd think I'm the one
with high cholesterol.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.163
My cholesterol's fine.

04:12.207 --> 04:13.600
If you say so.

04:13.644 --> 04:16.081
Don't have to. My doctor did.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.911
Yeah, my cholesterol'sgetting a little high lately.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.348
See, my cholesterol's
never an issue

04:22.391 --> 04:24.045
'cause I never get it tested.

04:24.088 --> 04:25.874
The real problem
is these tests.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.788
[laughing]

04:27.831 --> 04:30.312
[laughs]:
Yeah, tests. Who needs 'em?

04:31.358 --> 04:32.968
[mouths]

04:33.011 --> 04:34.360
[whispers]:
Something terrible.

04:37.101 --> 04:39.103
It's so pretty here.

04:44.066 --> 04:46.024
Tammy, put this in your mouth.

04:46.067 --> 04:48.375
We made rules.

04:48.418 --> 04:52.029
The food. Uh, tell me if itresonates with the common man.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.252
I'm not sure. Any chance youcould sneak some bacon in there?

04:56.295 --> 04:58.254
Ugh. Never mind.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.343
I don't know whyI'm doubting myself.

05:00.387 --> 05:03.737
These people are in forthe delight of their tiny lives.

05:03.781 --> 05:06.392
Damn, $24 chicken from a truck?

05:06.435 --> 05:09.656
It's not chicken,
you hillbilly, it's capon.

05:09.699 --> 05:12.963
From a truck in a parking lot
in front of the roller derby.

05:13.007 --> 05:15.184
Hey, buddy, I'm gonna need
two buckets of chicken

05:15.226 --> 05:16.315
and some slaw.

05:17.403 --> 05:19.319
Who's he talking to?

05:19.362 --> 05:20.624
That would be you.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.495
Uh, there's no slaw.

05:22.538 --> 05:25.411
This isn't a picnic in Alabammy.

05:25.454 --> 05:27.891
Then screw off, fancy-pants.

05:28.893 --> 05:32.288
He gave me a double dokie.

05:32.331 --> 05:34.115
You just lost
your first customer.

05:34.158 --> 05:37.293
Well, I didn't like
his attitude.

05:37.336 --> 05:40.034
These are roller derby people.
It's not gonna get better.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.646
Oh, my God.

05:43.691 --> 05:46.127
There's a whole herd of them.

05:46.170 --> 05:47.824
Lot of tattoos.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.826
You're gonna die.

05:49.870 --> 05:51.654
Uh, Tammy.

05:51.699 --> 05:54.441
It occurs to me
that I might need a middleman.

05:54.483 --> 05:56.790
Uh, someone who speaks carny.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.141
Uh, would you stay and help me?

05:59.183 --> 06:01.012
No. Wait. No.

06:02.012 --> 06:03.144
I'll pay you a hundred dollars.

06:04.451 --> 06:05.625
And let you boss around Paul.

06:05.668 --> 06:06.713
Done.

06:06.757 --> 06:09.586
Paul, move my car.

06:09.629 --> 06:10.718
Chop, chop.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.471
Talk.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.298
You talk.

06:26.341 --> 06:27.951
So, uh, hey, did you
guys happen to catch

06:27.995 --> 06:29.300
the new Tom Hanks movie?

06:29.345 --> 06:32.348
Oh, yeah.
That guy really is every man.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.784
Andy can't stay awake
for a whole movie.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.134
[laughs]

06:36.177 --> 06:38.005
Well, if you didn't want me
to fall asleep,

06:38.048 --> 06:39.442
why would you leave
a weighted blanket

06:39.485 --> 06:41.225
on a recliner
in your home theater?

06:41.269 --> 06:43.663
Well, you don't fall asleep
watching football in there.

06:43.706 --> 06:46.187
Yeah, I don't, because
I can't guess the endings,

06:46.230 --> 06:48.016
unlike the movies you pick.

06:48.058 --> 06:49.843
"She owns a bookstore,
he's in real estate.

06:49.887 --> 06:52.062
Spoiler alert:
they fall in love."

06:52.106 --> 06:54.151
Well, at least they have
happy endings.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.197
If you don't love me,
just say so.

07:01.985 --> 07:03.814
I'm gonna go lose myself
in meat.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.384
[thuds]

07:08.427 --> 07:10.081
Tom Hanks? Really?

07:10.125 --> 07:12.692
If we turn on each
other, no one survives.

07:12.735 --> 07:15.346
You're right, I'm sorry.

07:15.391 --> 07:16.653
There should be an app

07:16.697 --> 07:18.002
that tells you
when your friends are fighting,

07:18.045 --> 07:20.351
so you can fake
a dead grandma and stay home.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.266
That's a great idea.

07:22.310 --> 07:23.355
I really love you.

07:23.399 --> 07:24.531
I really love you.

07:25.574 --> 07:26.706
[metallic thud]

07:27.707 --> 07:29.492
Okay, calm down.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.406
The steak can sense your anger.

07:33.408 --> 07:35.932
If we leave now, they might
not remember we were here.

07:37.456 --> 07:38.893
No, no, no.

07:38.935 --> 07:40.894
Jill's my friend
and she needs my help.

07:40.937 --> 07:43.550
God put me here
for a reason.

07:45.725 --> 07:48.728
It's a big house. Could
be hours till I find her.

07:52.167 --> 07:55.387
Yes, I know, sir.
It's coming right up, okay?

07:55.430 --> 07:57.737
Just be a few more minutes.
Thank you for your patience.

07:57.781 --> 08:00.262
I appreciate it, all right?

08:00.305 --> 08:02.437
I see you're wearing your beret
at a saucy angle.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.091
Are you trying
to send a message?

08:04.134 --> 08:06.398
Eyes on the chicken.

08:06.442 --> 08:09.531
Where's my food? We're
missing the dirt bike raffle.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.793
It's coming right up.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.100
I need five "coke vans"
and I need 'em now.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.492
Heard.
What's our ETA?

08:13.536 --> 08:15.538
I don't know.
I'm still on number one.

08:15.581 --> 08:17.105
What?

08:17.148 --> 08:18.367
Well, it's opening night.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.456
There might be
food critics out there.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.413
I'm sorry, he's
a perfectionist.

08:22.457 --> 08:25.548
Here, enjoy a complimentary
cup of cola from Paris.

08:25.591 --> 08:27.115
This is warm.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.247
That's how they drink
it in France. Oh, my God.

08:29.290 --> 08:31.553
Am I the only one
who summered in Provence?

08:31.598 --> 08:33.556
Order up.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.253
Finally.

08:39.126 --> 08:41.782
That'll be $24.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.434
[Jill crying]

08:43.479 --> 08:44.697
Jill?

08:44.740 --> 08:47.221
JILL:
Over here.

08:47.264 --> 08:49.745
One more time.Here.

08:49.789 --> 08:52.488
Here.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.317
There you are.
What's going on?

08:55.360 --> 08:58.275
Andy and I are gonna break up,
and it's all your fault.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.451
Hang on,
I don't want you to think

09:00.495 --> 09:02.236
I'm not taking you seriously.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.067
Okay, now go.

09:12.159 --> 09:15.903
After seeing you and Adam
at the Bistro so in love,

09:15.946 --> 09:19.471
I got to thinking I want
Andy and I to have that, too.

09:19.514 --> 09:21.125
I mean, sure,

09:21.168 --> 09:22.996
we're good, but I want
to go to that higher ground

09:23.039 --> 09:24.346
you were talking about.

09:24.389 --> 09:26.303
I want to get this show
on the road.

09:26.347 --> 09:27.957
There's nothing wrong with that.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.873
That's what I thought.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.222
So I came home,
marched right into the bathroom,

09:32.267 --> 09:34.790
told Andy I wanted
to deepen our relationship,

09:34.835 --> 09:36.619
and you know what he said?

09:36.663 --> 09:38.751
"Can I finish my shower first?"

09:39.796 --> 09:41.057
Can you believe that?

09:43.278 --> 09:46.323
So I flushed the toilet on him,
grabbed all the towels and left.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.326
[exhales]

09:48.370 --> 09:51.198
Why am I even
in this relationship?

09:51.241 --> 09:54.288
I mean, despite the efforts
of some pretty good doctors,

09:54.331 --> 09:56.465
I am not getting any younger.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.249
Here's the thing:

09:58.293 --> 10:00.511
the Bonnie-Adam journey
to perfection

10:00.556 --> 10:04.428
starts in a little town
I call Communication.

10:04.472 --> 10:07.128
Well, how can I communicate
if he won't talk?

10:07.171 --> 10:09.086
Well, first you have to stop off
at a quaint little hamlet

10:09.129 --> 10:11.306
I call Patience.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.047
Adam was the same way.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.788
He'd only open up to me after
watching a movie about sports

10:15.831 --> 10:17.528
or when someone famous died.

10:17.572 --> 10:20.357
You know, someone they made
a sports movie about.

10:21.794 --> 10:23.884
After all these years
and all these relationships,

10:23.927 --> 10:26.321
you'd think I'd understand men
by now.

10:26.364 --> 10:27.713
Don't beat yourself up.

10:27.756 --> 10:29.366
How are you supposed
to understand the people

10:29.411 --> 10:32.196
who brought us war
and magic shows?

10:32.240 --> 10:33.850
I mean, they don't even
understand themselves.

10:33.894 --> 10:37.027
I think that's why
they overexplain everything.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.594
Oh, God.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.378
I asked Andy to turn up the heat

10:40.422 --> 10:42.990
and he told me how to build
a damn thermostat.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.774
I asked Adam
to turn down the heat

10:44.817 --> 10:46.645
and he explained
menopause to me.

10:48.255 --> 10:51.562
Sometimes with Bonnie,
I say, "Okay, let's talk,"

10:51.606 --> 10:53.653
and she's off to the races.

10:53.696 --> 10:56.786
I just nod my head
until she punches herself out.

10:56.830 --> 10:57.961
And that works?

10:58.004 --> 10:59.571
[scoffs]:
Yeah, it does.

10:59.615 --> 11:00.746
If I sit in the right place,

11:00.789 --> 11:02.662
I can watch TV
over her shoulder.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.187
Jill demands eye contact.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.014
You should hear some
of the things she says.

11:08.057 --> 11:10.104
I guarantee you
I've heard worse.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.279
Oh, really?

11:12.322 --> 11:14.412
You want to play
that game with me?

11:14.456 --> 11:17.110
"We can't watch Shark Tank
anymore because you think

11:17.153 --> 11:19.461
all my inventions are stupid."

11:19.504 --> 11:22.682
"I know it's 3:00 in the
morning and you're sound asleep,

11:22.725 --> 11:24.639
but why do you hate my feet?"

11:24.683 --> 11:26.336
[chuckles]

11:26.380 --> 11:28.904
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That fight greeted the dawn.

11:28.948 --> 11:30.732
Okay, okay.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.995
"There's a different brand
of women's razor

11:33.039 --> 11:34.258
"in the shower.

11:34.302 --> 11:35.782
Who are you sleeping with?"

11:35.825 --> 11:38.219
Oh, my God, my knees
just buckled.

11:38.261 --> 11:39.698
What'd you say?

11:39.741 --> 11:41.875
I said I'm not sleeping
with anyone, but if I were,

11:41.918 --> 11:44.746
she'd be smart enough
to shave her legs at her place.

11:44.790 --> 11:46.662
To which Bonnie replied,
"Oh, so now you don't think

11:46.706 --> 11:48.272
I'm smart enough?"

11:48.316 --> 11:51.667
I mean,
that-that-that's terrifying.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.408
I also realized that I've been
buying women's razors

11:54.451 --> 11:56.105
this whole time.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.631
Order up.

12:00.676 --> 12:03.634
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
It's not break time.

12:03.678 --> 12:04.811
I can't go on.

12:04.854 --> 12:05.855
No, you're not allowed
to say that

12:05.899 --> 12:07.116
until you've actually started.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.118
How did this happen?

12:08.162 --> 12:09.553
What have I done with my life?

12:09.597 --> 12:11.164
Ah, boy.

12:11.207 --> 12:12.774
I traveled the world

12:12.818 --> 12:14.864
with nothing but my knives
and a dream.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.692
I trained under
the great chefs of Europe,

12:17.736 --> 12:20.390
devoted years to my artistry,
and for what?

12:20.434 --> 12:24.264
To end up in a parking lot
serving ruffians in tank tops

12:24.307 --> 12:27.224
and pants that unzip
into shorts.

12:27.268 --> 12:30.793
You know, those people passed
quite a few vending machines

12:30.836 --> 12:33.230
to get to you, all because
something inside them said

12:33.274 --> 12:34.884
there's more to life
than Doritos.

12:34.927 --> 12:36.232
Mm. But is there?

12:36.277 --> 12:38.148
Yes! Your amazing chicken thing.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.455
Mm, I'm already in
a tiny metal coffin.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.239
Just close the lid
on your way out.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.937
Oh, cut the pity party.
You think this truck is small?

12:44.980 --> 12:47.244
Try seven years
in an eight-by-ten cell

12:47.288 --> 12:48.768
with a chronic masturbator.

12:48.811 --> 12:51.073
I did not survive that
to watch you give up.

12:51.118 --> 12:54.424
Ugh. This is classic
French cuisine.

12:54.469 --> 12:57.167
Giving up is what the French do.

12:59.038 --> 13:00.214
You know, the thing is,

13:00.256 --> 13:01.955
I've been in a hot patrol car
for ten hours.

13:01.998 --> 13:05.523
I mean, an 84-year-old woman
spit on me today.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.961
When I get home, I just want
to take a shower and relax.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.136
I don't want to talk
about my feelings.

13:10.179 --> 13:12.529
Especially when I'm
not wearing pants.

13:12.573 --> 13:14.183
I hear you.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.707
You know, after my divorce
I told myself

13:16.751 --> 13:18.493
I'm not gonna fall in love,

13:18.536 --> 13:20.364
I'm not gonna fall in love,
and what did I do?

13:20.408 --> 13:21.625
You fell in love.

13:21.669 --> 13:23.628
I did the same thing,
my friend.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.020
What's wrong with us?

13:25.065 --> 13:26.893
We can't say no
to a challenge.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.198
That's why we grill tri-tip.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.595
Maybe we should think
about our relationships

13:33.638 --> 13:34.596
the same way.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.033
Continue.

13:37.076 --> 13:40.601
You know, season it with care.

13:40.644 --> 13:44.171
Cook low and slow, always
cut against the grain.

13:44.213 --> 13:47.609
Sometimes just let it rest.

13:49.088 --> 13:52.004
Yeah, I got everything except
cutting against the grain.

13:52.048 --> 13:55.095
I don't know, maybe
I'm just hungry.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.707
You know what I think
you're afraid of?

13:59.750 --> 14:01.230
My mother.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.232
Success.

14:03.277 --> 14:04.931
I mean, restaurants are so over.

14:04.974 --> 14:07.498
Trucks are the future.
Food on the go.

14:07.542 --> 14:10.893
And I see a fleet
of Coq au Van trucks

14:10.937 --> 14:13.155
outside every
convention center...

14:13.200 --> 14:15.331
and Masonic Temple.

14:15.375 --> 14:16.985
You do?

14:17.029 --> 14:21.686
Yes! And it all starts
with that one plate of chicken.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.253
We've just got to find
a faster way

14:23.297 --> 14:24.732
to get it out the window.Yes.

14:24.775 --> 14:26.429
We could throw it at them.

14:26.474 --> 14:29.302
This is street food.
You eat it standing up.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.392
It needs to come with
a handle, like a stick

14:31.434 --> 14:32.827
or a taco shell.

14:32.871 --> 14:35.004
Hell, I'd settle for
a damn ice cream cone.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.136
[gasps]:
Our pita bread.

14:37.179 --> 14:38.702
Paul, you're my hero.

14:38.746 --> 14:41.183
What are you planningon doing with that?Saving your ass.

14:41.227 --> 14:43.707
And I'm gonna squirt mayo
on it, so look away.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.277
Fine, but let's call it aioli.

14:50.236 --> 14:52.673
This is the best tri-tip
I've ever had in my life.

14:52.716 --> 14:56.764
That, my friend, is the magic
of the reverse sear.

14:56.807 --> 14:58.722
You took a photo
of it, right?

14:58.767 --> 15:01.029
Oh, yeah. I already got
three likes on Instagram.

15:01.073 --> 15:02.075
I should follow you.

15:02.118 --> 15:06.078
It's RandyAndyBeefKing.

15:06.121 --> 15:08.690
Those bastards are
already eating.

15:08.732 --> 15:10.082
No, we're here for peace.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.432
Incoming.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.695
Hey.

15:13.738 --> 15:16.480
Got your salmon here.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.438
I left it on the grill a little
longer than I expected,

15:18.481 --> 15:21.442
but I promise it's still fish
under the black part.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.356
Thank you.

15:23.399 --> 15:27.534
Now, Jill, why don't you tell
Andy what you've been feeling?

15:27.577 --> 15:29.624
Okay.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.017
Dude, stop eating.

15:31.059 --> 15:33.975
Oh. Thank you.

15:34.019 --> 15:36.283
When I came into the bathroom
this afternoon,

15:36.326 --> 15:38.633
I was just trying to be
emotionally honest with you,

15:38.676 --> 15:40.287
and you got all cranky-pants.

15:40.330 --> 15:43.985
Look, Jill, I'm a cop, okay?
At the end of the day...

15:44.029 --> 15:44.986
Low and slow.

15:46.857 --> 15:49.687
Um, yeah, yeah, no, I-I--

15:49.730 --> 15:52.864
You're right, I could have been
much more receptive.

15:55.171 --> 15:58.347
I love it when you
open up to me.

16:02.264 --> 16:05.702
Jill, tell Andy what
you need from him.

16:05.746 --> 16:08.836
I need you to be
honest with me.

16:08.879 --> 16:10.751
Good or bad.

16:12.274 --> 16:13.624
[whispers]:
Nice job.

16:15.495 --> 16:16.626
Andy?

16:18.106 --> 16:20.283
What do you think
about what Jill just said?

16:22.458 --> 16:23.634
It's okay.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.463
Well, got to admit
I'm a little ashamed

16:27.508 --> 16:29.075
of the job I did on your fish.

16:30.815 --> 16:34.384
Not gonna lie,
I was cooking angry.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.951
I-I saw the fish as you,

16:35.995 --> 16:38.562
and I let it char
on direct heat.

16:38.605 --> 16:39.868
I'm better than that.

16:39.911 --> 16:44.611
But I, I hear you, and
I know what you want.

16:44.654 --> 16:46.395
You want a deeper
relationship,

16:46.440 --> 16:48.963
and I'm all for that.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.312
Really?

16:50.356 --> 16:52.227
Of course. I love you.

16:52.272 --> 16:55.187
I love you, too.

16:55.230 --> 16:57.625
And I know I got
to pick my spots.

16:57.668 --> 17:00.845
There's times when you're
not ready to talk.

17:00.889 --> 17:03.673
But I'm like a tiny
little terrier.

17:03.717 --> 17:05.675
I want what I want
when I want it.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.287
And that's...

17:07.329 --> 17:08.809
[grunts]

17:08.853 --> 17:10.855
No, no.

17:10.898 --> 17:11.855
Okay.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.163
Could I have a piece
of your steak?

17:14.207 --> 17:16.209
[chuckles]:
Aw, of course, babe.

17:16.251 --> 17:17.601
You can have the whole thing.

17:17.644 --> 17:19.994
My cholesterol's a
little high anyway.

17:20.038 --> 17:22.345
Look at that.

17:22.388 --> 17:23.999
A couple of minutes
with Dr. Bonnie,

17:24.042 --> 17:26.045
and the lovebirds are
back on the same perch.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.961
There is no doubt I should
take the shortest possible path

17:30.005 --> 17:32.050
to being an actual
licensed therapist.

17:32.094 --> 17:34.356
Well, actually, this guy
here sat me down...

17:34.401 --> 17:36.663
Season with care.
Way to go, babe.

17:36.707 --> 17:39.101
You really do know people.

17:39.144 --> 17:42.060
And you wanted to
sneak out and go home.

17:48.849 --> 17:50.199
I never thought I'd say this,

17:50.242 --> 17:52.157
but somehow the pita
pulls it all together.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.160
Told you.

17:54.202 --> 17:55.987
Thank you, Tammy.

17:56.030 --> 17:58.163
I don't think I could have
survived my maiden voyage

17:58.207 --> 17:59.469
without my favorite maiden.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.863
Oh, that's okay. I mean,
I cleaned up on tips.

18:01.905 --> 18:03.691
Plus, I didn't have
to watch Marjorie

18:03.733 --> 18:06.214
put ointment in
her cat's eye.

18:06.259 --> 18:09.044
Do you really think that I could
have a fleet of these trucks?

18:09.087 --> 18:11.089
Oh, yeah. But I
want a percentage.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.090
Done.[chuckles]

18:12.134 --> 18:13.656
Look at us.

18:13.701 --> 18:15.702
Despite our past, we learned
that we could work together

18:15.746 --> 18:19.358
and, uh, keep things
strictly professional.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.751
You have a little
mayo on your lip.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.145
It's aioli.

18:27.192 --> 18:28.498
[thumping]

18:39.117 --> 18:40.423
[sighs]
I got to say,

18:40.467 --> 18:42.730
I am really impressed
with myself.

18:42.772 --> 18:45.166
I mean, we walked into
the middle of a breakup,

18:45.211 --> 18:47.125
and I turned it
into a breakthrough.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.692
[chuckles]
Yeah.

18:48.736 --> 18:51.565
I kid, but I really should
write a book on relationships.

18:51.607 --> 18:55.916
Do the speaker's circuit,
go on Sally Jessy Raphael.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.223
Which, of course, would
turn into my own talk show.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.574
Divorce lawyers
will hate me,

19:00.616 --> 19:03.271
but the world
will love me.

19:03.316 --> 19:05.622
Hold my hand.

19:05.665 --> 19:08.711
This. This is what
I'm talking about!

19:08.756 --> 19:10.758
[both chuckle]

19:12.586 --> 19:14.282
Oh. It's Jill.

19:14.326 --> 19:16.154
Safety first.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.461
"Andy just told me
he wants a..."

19:19.506 --> 19:21.028
Oh.

19:21.071 --> 19:23.117
Wants a what?

19:23.162 --> 19:25.859
A-Andy wants a break from her.

19:26.773 --> 19:28.689
What did you do?
