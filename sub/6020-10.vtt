00:01.000 --> 00:02.069
Hey, you know what?

00:02.240 --> 00:04.390
It says "no food or drink."
Can't take that in.

00:04.560 --> 00:07.358
- Just wait here. I'll be right out.
- Wait a second. Come on.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.032
I wanna go in.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.958
I'm just running in.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.679
Come on. Come on.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074

00:34.560 --> 00:36.755
You know what?
They don't have batteries here.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.717
Let's go.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.031
Hey, Georgie's moving out.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.031
- Get out.
- I'm out.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.794
Fantastic apartment
right across from mine.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.188
I can't wait for you to see.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.148
- Is it better than mine?
- Oh, yeah.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.872
So it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-
make-your-friends-hate-you.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.189
It's better than Elaine's.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.873
- Gotta give her a call.
- She's out.

01:03.040 --> 01:06.077
- Right, the blind date.
- Well, they like to call it a setup now.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.835
I guess the blind people don't like
being associated with all those losers.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.672
Come on,
come check out my new place.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.078
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer
down at my Mini Storage.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.514
Got any extra furniture there?

01:16.680 --> 01:20.070
I need some more stuff to fill that
extra bedroom with a walk-in closet.

01:20.520 --> 01:22.192
Oh, this is really annoying.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.518
It's working already.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.235
What is with that?

01:30.720 --> 01:32.153
Well, it's coughing, Jerry.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.915
It expels the diseased germs
out of the body into the air.

01:36.920 --> 01:40.117
- Where is your key?
- Yeah, well, Newman... He's got it.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.874
You know, Kramer,
I rented out half of my space to you.

01:43.040 --> 01:46.032
Yeah, and I rented out half that space
to Newman.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.674
Mailbags?

01:53.840 --> 01:55.273
He's storing mail in here?

01:55.440 --> 01:57.271
Evidently.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.434
Excuse me, George?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.274
No menus.

02:02.040 --> 02:05.874
No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi,
president of the tenants' association.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.110
Oh, right. Right. Hey.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.555
I love the floors in here.
It's like a gymnasium.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.473
- Try and guard me. Come on.
- No, no.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.596
George, unfortunately,
Clarence Eldridge, in 8C...

02:18.760 --> 02:20.955
...has decided
that he wants the apartment.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.198
Yeah, but you promised it to me.

02:23.360 --> 02:27.672
Yes, but you see, Mr. Eldridge
is an Andrea Doria survivor.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.949
And in light of the terrible suffering
that he's already been through...

02:32.120 --> 02:33.917
...we've decided to give it to him.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.312
Well...

02:36.480 --> 02:37.913
...the Andrea Doria.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.999
That was quite a fire.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.869
- Shipwreck.
- I remember it.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.996
Where is this guy? I hate this.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.675
I should have brought something
to read.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.279
"Cancer in laboratory animals."

03:00.320 --> 03:01.719
Excuse me. Elaine Benes?

03:01.880 --> 03:03.632
- Yeah?
- An Alan Mercer called for you.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.519
He said he's sorry,
but he won't be able to make it tonight.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.113
He's been stabbed.

03:10.680 --> 03:11.669
Stabbed?

03:12.480 --> 03:13.993
More bread?

03:18.040 --> 03:19.519
You ate more bread?

03:21.440 --> 03:22.873
That is not the point.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.439
The guy was stabbed.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.238
- You find out who stabbed him?
- Yeah.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.039
It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.629
Well, you're not going near
this hooligan anymore.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.671
I don't know.
I mean, think about it, Jerry.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.990
There must be something exciting
about this guy...

03:38.160 --> 03:41.755
...if he can arouse
that kind of passion.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.917
I mean, to be stabworthy,
you know? It's...

03:48.320 --> 03:50.470
It's kind of a compliment.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.552
Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot.
He could have been the one.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.914
Hey, how's everybody?

03:58.080 --> 03:59.195
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:00.600 --> 04:03.160
There's no expiration date on this.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.674
There is now.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.909
You should get that cough
checked out by a doctor.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.310
No, no, no. No doctors for me.

04:12.480 --> 04:16.519
Bunch of lackeys and yes men
all toeing the company line.

04:17.079 --> 04:19.958
Plus they botched my vasectomy.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.554
- They botched it?
- I'm even more potent now.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.035
- Hey.
- Hey, how's the new place?

04:28.200 --> 04:29.394
Gone.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.154
The tenant association
made me give it to this guy...

04:32.320 --> 04:34.470
...because he was
an Andrea Doria survivor.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.515
Andrea Doria? Is that the one
they did the song about?

04:37.680 --> 04:39.238
Edmund Fitzgerald.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.676
I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.

04:43.720 --> 04:47.508
No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer.
Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.671
You could fit 15 people
in that bathroom.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.831
I think Gordon Lightfoot
was the boat.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.639
Yeah, and it was rammed
by the Cat Stevens.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.960
The Andrea Doria collided
with the Stockholm in dense fog...

04:58.120 --> 05:00.839
...12 miles off the coast
of Nantucket.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.238
- How do you know?
- It's in my book:

05:06.400 --> 05:08.914
Astonishing Tales of the Sea.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.073
Fifty-one people died.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.356
Fifty-one people?

05:14.520 --> 05:16.112
That's it?

05:16.520 --> 05:18.317
I thought it was like a thousand.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.948
There were 1660 survivors.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.031
That's no tragedy.

05:23.200 --> 05:27.273
How many people you lose
on a normal cruise, 30, 40?

05:27.440 --> 05:28.759
Can I look at that book?

05:28.920 --> 05:30.876
Oh, yeah.
I also got Astounding Bear Attacks.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.918
Before you go, did you talk to Newman
about getting that mail out?

05:34.080 --> 05:35.798
Oh, yeah. No, he's not gonna do it.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.078
- Newman?
- I guess.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.114
Listen, I want you to get the mail
out of my storage unit.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.078
Sometimes we don't get
what we want.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.038
- What are you talking about?
- I didn't get my transfer.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.555
- Transfer?
- To Hawaii.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.439
The most sought after postal route
of them all.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.798
The air is so dewy sweet, you don't
even have to lick the stamps.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.312
But it's not to be.
So I'm hanging it up.

06:08.480 --> 06:11.040
- You quit the post office?
- Kind of.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.715
I'm still collecting checks,
I'm just not delivering mail.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.390
Well, get it out of my storage.
It's illegal.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.949
And yet it's perfectly legal
to take a man's soul...

06:21.120 --> 06:23.270
...and crush it out
like a stale Pall Mall.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.396
Well, the law's the law.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.675
Hold on there, it's...

06:31.840 --> 06:34.400
- It's a nasty cough you got there.
- What cough?

06:39.560 --> 06:41.915
I love shrimp. I'm a shrimp eater.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.319
You put shrimp in front of me,
and I'll eat it till my stomach pops.

06:47.920 --> 06:51.151
No, it's okay.
I'm still just a little bit jumpy.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.592
Between you and me...

06:53.760 --> 06:55.876
...what happened there,
with the stabbing?

06:56.040 --> 06:58.474
Just one of those things, you know.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.676
What, was she just so crazy
in love with you...

07:00.840 --> 07:02.717
...she just couldn't take it
anymore, or?

07:02.880 --> 07:04.632
I don't know. Could be.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.793
- Alan?
- Carol?

07:11.120 --> 07:13.429
Was that the one?
Was that the one who stabbed you?

07:13.600 --> 07:14.874
No, that was a different girl.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.156
There was another
crazed ex-girlfriend?

07:20.320 --> 07:23.198
Right. So I called my friend...
You know, the one who set us up?

07:23.360 --> 07:26.079
I found out
he's a bad breaker-upper.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.798
- Bad how?
- You know when you break up...

07:28.960 --> 07:30.552
...how you say things
you don't mean?

07:30.720 --> 07:32.199
He says things you don't mean...

07:32.360 --> 07:33.634
...but means them.
- I follow.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.279
- What are you gonna do?
- Dump him.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.670
I can't be with someone
who doesn't break up nicely.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.956
That's an important part
of a relationship.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.633
What's more important?

07:45.800 --> 07:47.392
Hey.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.751
- What's with the dog?
- This is Smuckers.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.512
I borrowed him.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.677
Yeah, we share the same affliction.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.398
I'm gonna have a vet check us out.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.711
- A vet?
- I'll take a vet over an MD any day.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.839
They gotta cure a lizard, a chicken,
a pig, a frog, all on the same day.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.958
So if I may jump ahead...

08:09.120 --> 08:10.712
...you're gonna take dog medicine?

08:10.880 --> 08:13.110
You bet we are. How smart is that?

08:14.320 --> 08:15.992
See you.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.112
Ahoy, Mr. Eldridge.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.316
I understand you were on
the Andrea Doria.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.630
Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.634
I tell you, I hear people really stuff
themselves on those cruise ships.

08:32.799 --> 08:36.155
The buffet, that's the real ordeal,
huh, Clarence?

08:36.320 --> 08:37.753
We had to abandon ship.

08:37.919 --> 08:41.116
Well, all vacations
have to end eventually.

08:41.679 --> 08:42.874
The boat sank.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.838
According to this,
it took 10 hours.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.197
It eased into the water like an old man
into a nice warm bath. No offence.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.274
So, Clarence, how about...

08:53.440 --> 08:56.000
...abandoning this apartment
and letting me shove off in it?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.479
Is that what this is about?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.673
I don't think I like you.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.155
It's my apartment, Eldridge.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.630
The Stockholm
may not have sunk you, but I will.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.194
What are the symptoms?

09:11.360 --> 09:13.874
Well, it hurts when he swallows...

09:14.040 --> 09:16.156
...especially when he drinks
orange juice.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.788
I mean, dog-food juice.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.030
And what's worse,
he has a nagging cough.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.151
That's it. That's it.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.795
Yeah, well, we've been seeing
a lot of this lately.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.632
Been drinking from the toilet?

09:28.800 --> 09:31.439
What? No.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.072
That's disgusting.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.598
So that's it? We're breaking up?

09:37.760 --> 09:38.954
What? Breakup?

09:39.120 --> 09:42.396
- We went out on one date.
- Okay, yeah, sure, whatever you say.

09:43.240 --> 09:44.912
All right. Good, good.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.958
Okay, then, well...
So I'll see you around...

09:48.120 --> 09:49.599
...big head.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.039
- Pardon?
- You got a big head.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.553
It's too big for your body.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.674
That's it?

09:59.400 --> 10:01.550
That's the best you got?

10:02.760 --> 10:05.593
So he's keeping the apartment.
He doesn't deserve it, though.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.830
If he did suffer,
that was like 40 years ago.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.433
What have you done
for me lately?

10:09.600 --> 10:13.115
I've been suffering for the past 30
years up to and including yesterday.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.157
If this board is impressed
with suffering...

10:15.320 --> 10:18.278
...maybe you should tell them
the astonishing tales of Costanza.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.236
- I should.
- Your work in this field is unparalleled.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.709
I could go bummer-to-bummer
with anyone on the planet.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.472
You're the man.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.838
- Jerry...
- I'll be with you in a moment.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.910
So you want a protein shake
or something?

10:38.400 --> 10:40.197
I guess I should get moving
on this, huh?

10:40.360 --> 10:42.271
- I'm gonna go.
- All right.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.469
Hello, Newman.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.790
- That mail, where is it?
- What's the difference?

10:47.960 --> 10:49.916
The guy with the Hawaii transfer
got busted...

10:50.080 --> 10:52.036
...for hoarding
Victoria's Secret catalogs.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.799
I gotta deliver that mail.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.791
Well, go ahead.
There's eight bags of it.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.359
Blast.

10:58.520 --> 11:02.593
There's no way I can handle eight
in addition to my usual load of one.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.958
I'll never get to Hawaii.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.509
I'll be stuck
in this apartment building forever.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.718
The dream is dead.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.553
- You're giving up that easy?
- I usually do.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.399
- See you.
- Wait a minute, Newman.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.118
You can't let this dream die.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.510
You moving away is my dream too.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.596
- What are you proposing?
- Whatever it takes...

11:24.760 --> 11:26.955
...for as long as it takes,
wherever it takes me...

11:27.120 --> 11:29.395
...so long as it takes you
away from me.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.994
- An alliance?
- An alliance.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.596
Now get the hell out of here.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.557
Hawaii? That's why you're
helping Newman with the mail?

11:44.720 --> 11:47.154
Elaine,
Newman is my sworn enemy...

11:47.320 --> 11:51.393
...and he lives down the hall
from my home. My home, Elaine.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.711
Where I sleep,
where I come to play with my toys.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.872
Well, anyway, get this...

11:57.080 --> 11:58.274
...I spoke to Alan.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.670
You know, I told him
I didn't wanna see him anymore.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.353
Called me big head.

12:02.520 --> 12:03.748
Big head?

12:03.920 --> 12:05.512
It's almost a compliment.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.552
It's one of the nicest things
anyone has ever said to me.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.232
- Hello? Hey, George.
- Hey.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.233
- Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.
- You can't make it?

12:17.400 --> 12:20.790
Yeah, the tenant association has
decided to hear my side of the story...

12:20.960 --> 12:22.951
...so I gotta kind of get ready.
I'll see you.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.473
All right.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.677
- Is he not gonna go?
- Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.833
- All right, well, I'll see you.
- All right.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.950
Kramer, aren't you taking
any medication for that?

12:38.120 --> 12:40.236
Yeah. Yeah, I got some pills.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.753
They taste terrible.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.798
- Just swallow them.
- Oh, my throat's too tender.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.871
- All right, sit down.
- I don't want to.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.429
- Come on. Just sit down.
- No, Jerry. What...?

12:50.600 --> 12:51.749
- Lay down.
- Why?

12:51.920 --> 12:53.831
- Sit down. Lean your head back.
- Hey!

12:54.000 --> 12:55.513
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.148
Open it. Open it.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.068
What kind of pills are these
anyway?

13:11.240 --> 13:12.639
"For Smuckers"?

13:14.200 --> 13:17.636
"May cause panting
and loss of fur"?

13:19.160 --> 13:20.593
These are dog pills.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.193
We had the same symptoms.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.794
But he's a dog.
You need to see a real doctor.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.154
No. No doctors.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.833
All right.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.589
Where are you going?

13:29.760 --> 13:31.990
I'm taking the car. I gotta run errands.
Wanna go?

13:32.160 --> 13:33.354
I don't know.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.670
Come on, you wanna go
for a ride, huh?

13:36.160 --> 13:38.754
Come on. Come on. Yeah.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.636
Lady, could you move your head
a little bit?

13:46.800 --> 13:49.758
- What?
- Your head. I can't see out the back.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.951
Little more.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.591
Little more.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.712
Thank you.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.869
I don't see any tissues back here.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.394
Wait a minute.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.994
This isn't the way to the park.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.388
Where are we going?

14:13.920 --> 14:16.275
I recognize this block.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.313
You're taking me to the doctor.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.350
So, Mom, Dad...

14:22.560 --> 14:24.357
...I was hoping
that you could help me...

14:24.520 --> 14:27.193
...to remember my childhood
a little more clearly.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.272
I feel a draft. Let's change tables.

14:30.440 --> 14:31.998
Get out of here. We have a booth.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.471
Frank, I'm cold.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.318
Order a hot dish.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.351
Why can't we sit over there?

14:39.520 --> 14:42.876
- That's not a booth.
- Who says we have to sit in a booth?

14:43.040 --> 14:46.237
I didn't take the subway to New York
to sit at a table like that!

14:46.440 --> 14:49.432
Well, I didn't take a subway
to be in a drafty restaurant!

14:49.600 --> 14:51.079
Mom...

14:51.240 --> 14:53.993
Now, George, what do you
wanna know about your childhood?

14:54.880 --> 14:57.553
Actually,
I think I'm pretty clear on it.

14:58.880 --> 15:01.189
Where's that breeze coming from?

15:01.600 --> 15:03.750
- Kramer, out of the car. Out now.
- No, Jerry.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.990
- All right. That's it. Come on.
- No. Jerry.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.068
Hey. Hey, get back over here.
Kramer.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.958
Get over here. You are bad.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.758
Bad neighbour.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.433
Kramer.

15:18.080 --> 15:22.039
Just then a rescue ship emerged
from the fog and saved us.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.553
It was...

15:26.840 --> 15:29.434
It was the sweetest sight
my eyes ever saw.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.072
Thank you, Mr. Eldridge.

15:32.440 --> 15:35.671
The tenant board will now hear
Mr. Costanza's testimony.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.073
How'd it go? Get it all delivered?

15:44.480 --> 15:47.074
- What happened?
- Kramer bit me.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.517
- Bit you?
- We had an argument about me...

15:52.680 --> 15:55.956
...moving to Hawaii and he locked on
to my ankle like it was a soup bone.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.675
I'm hobbled.
I don't think I can do my route.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.229
And they're awarding the transfer
in two days.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.311
- Well, what if I delivered it?
- You?

16:07.640 --> 16:10.359
- You can't deliver mail.
- Why not?

16:12.160 --> 16:15.118
You're right. It's just walking around
and putting it in the boxes.

16:15.280 --> 16:18.875
- Well, what am I gonna wear?
- My uniform from my rookie year.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.429
I can't believe
I'm gonna be a mailman.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.514
Here you go. Merry Christmas.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.874
Mail on Sunday?

16:42.600 --> 16:47.116
I was handcuffed to the bed
in my underwear...

16:47.280 --> 16:48.474
...where I remained for...

16:48.640 --> 16:50.870
She certainly seemed interested
in me.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.828
Though she was attractive,
she was also, in fact, a Nazi.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.915
The water that I had been
swimming in was very cold...

17:00.320 --> 17:04.711
...and when I dropped the towel
there had been significant shrinkage.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.510
My parents were looking at me.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.636
So there I was...

17:10.400 --> 17:13.278
...with the marble rye hanging
from the end of a fishing pole.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.749
In closing, these stories
have not been embellished...

17:15.920 --> 17:17.751
...because they need
no embellishment.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.391
They are simply, horrifyingly,
the story of my life...

17:21.560 --> 17:25.633
...as a short, stocky,
slow-witted bald man.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.593
Thank you.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.552
Oh, also...

17:31.720 --> 17:35.554
...my fiancée died from licking
toxic envelopes that I picked out.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.392
Thanks again.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.958
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff
in the box like you told me...

17:47.120 --> 17:49.554
...but sometimes it says,
"Photographs: Do not bend."

17:49.720 --> 17:51.631
Do not bend.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.110
Just crease, crumple, cram.
You'll do fine.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.839
Hello?

18:01.280 --> 18:02.793
This is he.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.311
I don't understand.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.634
Very well.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.429
What?

18:10.600 --> 18:13.433
That was the vice president
of the post office.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.791
I didn't get the transfer.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.520
They knew it wasn't me
doing my route.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.829
How did they know?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.560
Too many people got their mail.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.312
Close to 80 percent.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.711
Nobody from the post office has ever
cracked the 50-percent barrier.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.518
It's like the three-minute mile.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.672
- I tried my best.
- Exactly.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.229
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.192
You know, this is your coat.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.038
Damn.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.556
He flew right into your head...

18:54.720 --> 18:56.278
...like he couldn't avoid it.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.279
Really?

18:58.440 --> 19:00.396
Never seen that before...

19:00.560 --> 19:02.755
...bird into a woman's head.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.075
There's no contest.
The guy had nothing.

19:11.240 --> 19:15.233
The ship went down,
he got into a lifeboat. Come on.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.550
Boy, he didn't know
what he was up against.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.031
So when do you move
into the apartment?

19:20.200 --> 19:22.714
They're making their decision today.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.910
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing...

19:27.080 --> 19:31.471
...except that a bird
ran into my giant freak head.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.074
What giant freak head?

19:35.240 --> 19:39.711
The one that sits atop
my disproportionately puny body.

19:40.720 --> 19:43.393
I'm a walking candy apple.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.996
So it's actually gotten to you?

19:48.160 --> 19:50.720
You're playing right into his hands.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.838
What? Yeah, you're right.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.716
All I have to do is call him up
and sit down with him...

19:57.880 --> 19:59.791
...and show him
that it doesn't bother me.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.552
You know, laugh it off.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.438
Or jam a fork into his forehead.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.878
- Either way.
- All right.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.395
- I want to apologize for...
- Oh, please.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.279
- And I hope we can get past all this.
- Past? We're way past.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.795
- So you have a big head.
- So what?

20:16.960 --> 20:19.315
Goes well with the bump
in your nose.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.469
What?

20:23.320 --> 20:27.279
Please, get help. There's a crazy,
bigheaded woman beating some guy.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.716
Tell the police
it's the Old Mill Restaurant. Hurry.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.431
That's some cough you got.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.238
He's trying
to tell us something.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.470
- What is it? Trouble?
- Trouble.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.153
Trouble where? Where's trouble?

20:48.320 --> 20:50.311
Old Mill.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.516
Trouble at the Old Mill?
Oh, my God.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.796
Good boy. Good boy.
Lead the way. Come on.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.194
Excuse me,
what are you doing in there?

21:08.360 --> 21:11.079
I'm moving in.
Alan Mercer, new neighbour.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.071
But, what...?
Elaine's "big head" guy?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.990
- They gave you the apartment?
- Yeah.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.276
Why? Because you were stabbed...

21:18.480 --> 21:20.357
...and got coffee thrown
in your face and...

21:20.520 --> 21:22.590
Oh, fork in the forehead.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.872
That's why
they gave you the apartment?

21:25.040 --> 21:27.508
No. Just gave the super 50 bucks.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.713
Wait a minute.
That is my apartment.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.394
I earned it with 34 years of misery.

21:32.560 --> 21:33.754
Tough luck, chinless.
