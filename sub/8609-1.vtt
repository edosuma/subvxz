02:11.673 --> 02:14.050
Yeah, Walter. Hi, it's George.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.886
I know it's my third call on a Saturday,

02:16.970 --> 02:20.973
but I'm having a bit of a problem
with the Lockwise Helping Hand account.

02:21.058 --> 02:24.268
Now, I know it's your baby,
and I know you'll straighten it out,

02:24.353 --> 02:28.648
but, well, I'm thinking of heading into
the office today to see if I can sort it out.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.984
So, no problems. We'll see you on Monday.

02:32.069 --> 02:35.947
Don't worry about it.
Give my Iove to Rebecca. Bye-bye.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.284
- Barbara, stop it.
- No.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.537
- You need this.
- No, I will not.

02:42.871 --> 02:43.996
George!

02:44.081 --> 02:45.915
George, yes. Where is George?

02:46.041 --> 02:48.042
- I would Iike to speak to him.
- I don't know.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.586
I don't even know who you are, young Iady.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.214
- George.
- Thank God.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.716
George, who is this young Iady?

02:56.385 --> 02:58.094
- Here, honey.
- That's...

02:58.220 --> 02:59.971
I can't do this.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.597
That's my wife, Mom.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.475
No. She's too young.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.269
How old is she?

03:06.395 --> 03:08.020
We were married nine years ago, remember?

03:08.105 --> 03:09.730
She's nine years old?

03:09.815 --> 03:13.317
Our marriage is nine years old,
our marriage.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.740
She's the second one.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.536
No. I adored the other one.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.414
I know, Mom, but,
you know, she tried to kill me.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.958
No, she didn't.
That was just a Iittle hit-and-run.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.752
Yeah, well, I was in traction for two months.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.754
I don't remember that.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.633
- Here you go.
- I Iike this one.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.595
- Well, that's the most popular one.
- Yeah.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.471
There you go.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.478
- We aren't done with this.
- Yes, I know. I know.

03:49.605 --> 03:52.231
And why are you wearing a shirt and tie
on a Saturday?

03:52.316 --> 03:54.108
I have to go into the office.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.277
- You're going into the office?
- Yes.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.029
- When?
- Now.

03:58.113 --> 04:01.115
George, aren't you forgetting something?

04:02.159 --> 04:04.118
No, I'm not.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.454
I Iove you.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.624
Nice try. Your son.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.252
You promised him you would take him
to his baseball game today.

04:13.337 --> 04:16.339
I'm not telling him this time. You do it.

04:16.464 --> 04:21.010
Honey, I'll be back in time.
The game doesn't start until 2:00.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.136
1 :00.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.430
I'll be back.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.808
Mom, Dad, Grandma isn't eating.

04:29.311 --> 04:32.480
God, I hate old people.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.315
Watch your mouth, young Iady.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.276
Why? It's not Iike she understands
anything we're saying.

04:37.361 --> 04:40.029
You know what? I've had
just about enough of your attitude.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.199
Hello? You Iistening?

04:43.492 --> 04:47.161
iPod. They were made
to ignore the stepmother.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.245
George?

04:48.330 --> 04:51.332
Honey, would you take those things off,
please, and Iisten to your mother?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.669
Okay, she is not my mother.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.004
She's the mother of that thing.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.881
- You're the thing.
- You're a thing.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.634
- You're a thing, sister.
- Don't call me that.

05:02.219 --> 05:05.680
Dad, I'm really excited
about the game today.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.140
It's gonna be so cool having you there.

05:08.850 --> 05:12.853
Jeremy's dad is always there,
but he yells at me if I miss the ball.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.980
Well, that's not gonna happen today, son.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.691
Now, I've got to run to the office,

05:16.817 --> 05:19.360
but I'll be back in time
to take you to your game.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.778
You promise?

05:21.863 --> 05:23.698
Scout's honor.

05:28.787 --> 05:29.787
Don't forget. I:00.

05:29.871 --> 05:30.955
He's not coming.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.208
That was the Star Trek sign.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.876
He's a Trekkie.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.878
And so am I.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.742
- Morning, Jackie.
- Hello.

06:07.826 --> 06:10.244
Don't you wish it was this quiet every day?

06:10.328 --> 06:12.538
Be careful what you wish for.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.888
Gotta be mine

06:33.018 --> 06:35.561
Gotta be strong

06:35.937 --> 06:38.731
A Iittle while

06:38.857 --> 06:42.526
And you got nothing to be guilty of

06:42.611 --> 06:44.528
You might not wanna sing that song.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.039
Okay. Shred everything.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.333
My shredder's broken.
I need another shredder!

06:57.417 --> 06:58.793
- Here we go!
- Who's got one?

06:58.877 --> 07:00.127
Don't Ieave any evidence. Nothing. Okay?

07:00.212 --> 07:01.879
- Put 'em in a box!
- Let me through. Let me through.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.799
Shred everything! Here, here. Right here!

07:08.678 --> 07:09.929
AII the boxes!

07:12.182 --> 07:14.433
AII right. Grab those two!
What are you doing?

07:15.685 --> 07:17.436
Just get it in here! Anything!

07:20.232 --> 07:21.649
I got one more!

07:21.733 --> 07:23.567
- Is it the Iast quarter?
- Yeah.

07:25.904 --> 07:26.987
Dump everything!

07:29.074 --> 07:30.157
George, come in here, buddy.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.952
Come in, come in, come in.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.829
Walter, what's going on?

07:34.913 --> 07:36.831
Hey, Iisten, pull your money out of the bank,

07:36.915 --> 07:39.583
cash in all your stocks and bonds
by 10:00 a.m. Monday morning.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.126
Why?

07:41.545 --> 07:44.713
Well, CNN is doing
one of those investigative reports

07:44.798 --> 07:46.507
about Lockwise Industries.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.845
That's fantastic.
That'll be great for business.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.807
Not really. They're gonna say we've been
running a Ponzi scheme for seven years.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.520
Well, they can't say that, Walter.
That's Iibelous.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.357
I mean, this firm's been operating
successfully for over 100 years.

08:03.483 --> 08:07.152
Yeah, yeah, they're focusing
on the charity division, Helping Hands.

08:07.237 --> 08:10.281
Helping Hands has been going strong
for over eight years.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.699
I should know. I'm CFO.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.034
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.412
Could you say that again,
the part about the CFO?

08:17.247 --> 08:19.540
I'm CFO. I should know.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.834
Right. Perfect, perfect. Thanks.

08:21.960 --> 08:26.672
Walter, are they reporting
that it's our division?

08:27.048 --> 08:28.507
Yeah. Your division.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.509
But I have all the records.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.928
Say that again.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.972
But I have all the records.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.017
Perfect. Now shred them.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.894
- Walter.
- Yeah.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.937
What are you saying?

08:42.313 --> 08:43.981
I'm saying that all the monies

08:44.065 --> 08:48.903
that came into Lockwise Industries'
Helping Hands charity investment group

08:48.987 --> 08:51.196
are part of a big, old Ponzi scheme.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.324
What?

08:53.992 --> 08:55.284
Yeah. Christ.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.828
It worked for a while.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.789
I almost feel bad for hanging
you out to dry Iike this.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.584
You should see your face, dude.

09:04.085 --> 09:07.463
And by the way,
this is not gonna be pretty for you.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.548
I feel awful.

09:09.633 --> 09:10.883
Horrible.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.509
What? But...

09:13.219 --> 09:14.261
For me?

09:14.346 --> 09:16.597
You were a Iowly accountant, remember?

09:16.681 --> 09:20.476
And then I pull you out of bookkeeping
and make you the CFO.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.687
I mean, you had no experience
whatsoever. None. None at all.

09:23.772 --> 09:27.483
I had worked here five years
prior to that, Walter.

09:27.567 --> 09:32.488
- I was working hard. I thought I earned it.
- You did work hard.

09:32.614 --> 09:36.408
Nobody earns it around here.
I had to bang my way to the top.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.036
And there's a Iot of big women
on the Board of Directors here.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.164
And that was hard,
and it was hard to stay hard.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.875
So don't talk to me about "hard."

09:45.085 --> 09:50.047
Okay? You were paid a seven-figure salary
for exactly this reason.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.924
What reason?

09:52.926 --> 09:56.971
So you could take the fall.
Man, you've been paid to be screwed.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.264
Kind ofjealous. Oh, well.

09:59.516 --> 10:03.268
Walter, I knew nothing about this.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.729
Yeah, I know. I know. Sorry.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.524
Would have ruined it if you had, kind of.

10:10.443 --> 10:14.071
Well, that explains why I couldn't get
those accounts to balance.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.739
Now you're thinking.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.994
What about the charities?
Walter, 82 charities.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.704
They think their monies are safe.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.914
I'm handing you over to the Feds,

10:24.082 --> 10:27.835
and all you care about
is the stupid charities?

10:29.295 --> 10:30.671
By the way, there's only 12 charities.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.966
There's 82 charities.

10:34.426 --> 10:38.595
No, there's 12. The other 70 companies
were set up by the Malone family.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.098
Awkward.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.768
The Mafia Malones?

10:45.020 --> 10:47.271
You've been Iaundering money, dude.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.107
Yeah, this is gonna be really awful for you.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.193
Hey, man, be careful
when you start your car.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.532
This is not happening.

10:59.034 --> 11:02.536
A Ponzi scheme? A Ponzi scheme?

11:03.455 --> 11:07.374
Walter, where are the investors' monies?

11:09.627 --> 11:12.254
Walter? Walter!

11:19.804 --> 11:25.726
Okay, calm down. Calm, calm, calm.
Calm down.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.686
That's it. That's it.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.564
Just calm down.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.943
I'm not calming. I'm not calming.
I'm not calming.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.669
- Hey, boss, just the person I wanna see.
- What do you have?

11:52.754 --> 11:55.339
So I've been Iooking
into the Malone crime family, right?

11:55.423 --> 11:56.423
And the more I Iook at them,

11:56.549 --> 11:58.175
I'm finding that they're connected
to this company

11:58.259 --> 12:00.677
that does a Iot of charity
investment work, called Lockwise.

12:00.762 --> 12:01.762
Yes?

12:01.846 --> 12:03.764
I think they may be
Iaundering money through them.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.266
- We've been after these guys for years.
- Yeah.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.435
Why don't you see
what you can find out, okay?

12:08.520 --> 12:09.853
Okay.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.438
Thanks a Iot.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.668
George?

13:18.590 --> 13:21.258
I've been calling you for hours.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.012
Yeah, I know. I know.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.722
How is he?

13:27.348 --> 13:30.350
- He was upset, but he'll be fine.
- That's good.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.269
Is it true?

13:33.229 --> 13:34.271
What?

13:34.355 --> 13:37.191
Come on, George.
Don't play games with me.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.943
AII the wives were talking about it
at the field today.

13:41.696 --> 13:42.863
Honey,

13:43.281 --> 13:47.326
I swear I had no idea this was going on.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.410
Okay? None.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.496
I walked into the office,
and there's Walter, and he's saying,

13:51.581 --> 13:54.374
"Why don't you shred stuff?
Shred whatever you have.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.668
"Shred what's in your desk.
Just shred everything."

13:56.753 --> 13:58.378
And I'm going, "What's going on?"

13:58.463 --> 14:00.380
And he's saying,
"You're gonna take the fall for this,

14:00.465 --> 14:04.509
"because it's a Ponzi scheme.
It's a Ponzi scheme, and you're the one.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.012
"You're going down,
'cause you're the CFO."

14:07.096 --> 14:12.059
You know? I mean, they gave
Bernie Madoff 200 years, honey.

14:12.143 --> 14:15.229
What do you think they're gonna do to me?
What do you think they're gonna do?

14:15.396 --> 14:18.190
And what's gonna happen with the kids?
What's gonna happen?

14:18.274 --> 14:20.734
Howie's afraid, you know,
"Dad, you missed a game."

14:20.818 --> 14:23.111
I'm gonna miss 38 seasons.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.614
Sweetheart, I'm in trouble.

14:26.991 --> 14:29.910
- Calm down.
- Okay.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.248
- We need to get a Iawyer.
- A Iawyer.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.625
And then you need to go to your mom's

14:36.751 --> 14:38.460
and go find your mom's Valium.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.504
Get a Valium out of my mom's purse.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.881
- Okay. Can you do that? Like right now.
- Okay.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.591
And you need to calm down.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.885
- Honey.
- It's gonna be okay.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.470
- It will be. It will be.
- Yes.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.765
You know, minimum security.
It's not that bad.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.184
Hey, Madea.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.938
Hey, Lorraine, how you doing?
Good to see you.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.279
Lord, it's a zoo up in there
on the first of the month.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.790
Excuse me, ma'am. You wanna take this?
I don't feel Iike taking it back.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.251
Thank you so much.
It's crazy up in there. Be careful.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.461
They ain't taking that EBT card.
They stopped taking that.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.547
I got to go somewhere else that take that.

15:24.007 --> 15:27.134
Yeah, I got to go burn up my EBT card.

15:33.975 --> 15:40.939
Give me your money.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.526
That's a cute Iittle gun you got, boy.
Get out this car.

15:44.610 --> 15:49.906
Lady, I will stab and shoot you.
Give me your money.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.159
Son, I'm gonna tell you this one time, okay?

15:52.243 --> 15:54.786
I want you to get out of this car
and go on about your business.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.204
Go get you a job.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.999
You ain't supposed to be stealing
from nobody working as hard as I...

15:59.083 --> 16:01.251
What the hell you got to come over here
and steal from the poor for?

16:01.336 --> 16:04.129
Get out the car. This is your warning, son.
Get out the car. Now, go on.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.881
Then give me your money!

16:06.090 --> 16:09.217
I worked for years to get my Social Security.
Now, I finally got it.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.427
I ain't on no fixed income.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.220
I'm on a broke income,
'cause I'm broke as hell.

16:12.347 --> 16:13.805
Now, I want you
to get the hell out of this car.

16:13.890 --> 16:17.392
This is your chance. Get out of the car, son.
Go on, now. Go get you a job.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.895
I'm gonna ask you one more time,
old woman.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.355
I'm gonna tell you one more time.

16:21.439 --> 16:26.026
Look here! Get out of this car.
Go find you a job. Do you understand me?

16:26.110 --> 16:28.779
They got people all over the world
that is working hard,

16:28.863 --> 16:31.281
and y'all young thugs gonna come
try to take money from somebody.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.116
That makes me mad.
Now, you about to make me mad.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.202
You about to piss me off.
Now, get on out the car, son.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.912
- I'm gonna count to three.
- Okay.

16:37.038 --> 16:41.792
One, two, three.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.128
Four.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.547
Five.

16:47.882 --> 16:51.343
I thought you was gonna count to three.
Son. Son, son, Iet me tell you something.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.303
Get out the car
and go on about your business.

16:53.388 --> 16:56.765
Now, this is your Iast chance.
This is your Iast chance. Now I got to go.

16:56.891 --> 17:01.395
One more time. One, two...

17:01.479 --> 17:02.729
Three!

17:08.903 --> 17:10.112
Let's go this way.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.823
Put your seat belt on.
You need a car seat?

17:13.407 --> 17:14.782
Come get my money!

17:15.117 --> 17:17.618
Trying to take my damn money
that I worked this hard for.

17:19.414 --> 17:20.579
Lady!

17:20.748 --> 17:22.290
I don't got insurance, Iady!

17:23.501 --> 17:24.792
Slow down! Slow down!

17:24.961 --> 17:27.503
You're screaming
straight up Iike a Iittle biatch!

17:27.672 --> 17:28.755
I want to go home!

17:32.093 --> 17:35.303
You want the money? You come get it.
I come get the money.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.305
- I'm a real thug! I'm a real thug!
- You crazy!

17:37.432 --> 17:38.849
Oh, my God!

17:43.438 --> 17:44.479
Jake!

17:44.856 --> 17:47.107
I'm sorry. Take it.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.736
Hey, what do you got?

17:51.821 --> 17:54.072
Well, just got off the phone with the SEC,

17:54.157 --> 17:58.368
and it seems that this Lockwise charity
is definitely a Ponzi scheme.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.162
COO, one Walter Burns.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.789
CFO, George Needleman.
Never heard of him.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.124
Let's arrest them both.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.042
Well, it turns out
that Burns is on a private jet,

18:06.127 --> 18:09.337
according to the FAA, to Europe.
Took off five hours ago.

18:09.464 --> 18:12.674
So I'm sure he's gonna fight extradition.
But our boy, George, now...

18:12.800 --> 18:14.801
Boy George? I Iove Boy George.

18:15.136 --> 18:18.305
Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon

18:18.514 --> 18:22.517
You come and go
You come and go

18:22.643 --> 18:23.643
Sir?

18:24.604 --> 18:25.854
Sorry.

18:26.314 --> 18:29.483
George Needleman? Our guys should be
knocking at his door at any minute.

18:29.692 --> 18:30.775
Great.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.445
Well, it'd be great if we could get him
to testify against the Malones,

18:33.529 --> 18:34.571
but that may be a tall order.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.865
Okay, but no deal for him.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.368
Look, I'm tired of these people
sticking it to the poor.

18:40.495 --> 18:41.661
Sir, if we don't offer him a deal,

18:41.787 --> 18:45.040
what incentive does he have
to testify against the mob?

18:45.166 --> 18:46.666
It's very simple, Brian.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.836
If he testifies,
the Malones will probably kill him.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.465
If he doesn't,
he goes to prison for the rest of his Iife.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.175
It's a win-win.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.345
Sir, I think we should consider...

18:58.471 --> 19:00.013
No, you don't. I want him fried.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.850
Now, get our agents there
before the Malone family gets to him.

19:06.687 --> 19:07.812
Yes, sir.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.191
Hi, it's George Needleman
calling for Jeffrey.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.361
Yes, I'll hold.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.031
Where are my car keys?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.658
You don't drive anymore, Barbara.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.243
I know that.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.828
Dad, I wish you could have
been there today.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.956
Honey, your dad was very busy.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.541
You suck.
You should probably just give it up.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.751
No, I don't.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.253
Yes, you do.

19:32.255 --> 19:33.421
And I just tweeted that.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.340
- Dad!
- Howie, stop.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.593
Your dad's on the phone. Eat your dinner.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.345
Okay, thank you.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.065
What'd he say?

19:53.526 --> 19:57.195
Well, his secretary said
that he would recommend an attorney,

19:57.280 --> 19:59.948
but that he didn't wanna represent me.

20:00.283 --> 20:02.867
After all those years of business with him?

20:02.952 --> 20:03.994
Yeah.

20:04.078 --> 20:05.203
What about Jeffrey?

20:06.747 --> 20:09.082
Nobody's returning my calls.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.585
Has anyone seen my car keys?

20:13.254 --> 20:15.255
Mom, you don't drive anymore.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.008
Is it Hanukkah?

20:18.092 --> 20:19.509
No, it's not Hanukkah.

20:19.593 --> 20:25.181
Yes, it is. That's why that nice young man
asked me to deliver this package to George.

20:26.017 --> 20:29.602
And it's a Iong drive,
and so I need my car keys.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.689
Mom, who gave you this?

20:33.190 --> 20:35.358
In the backyard,

20:35.443 --> 20:39.446
this man with a shiny, black suit
and black, shiny hair.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.082
George, there's a note.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.714
"You tock from me."

20:57.798 --> 20:59.299
"Take," honey. That says "take."

20:59.383 --> 21:01.968
No, I think that's "tock," honey. T-O-C-K.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.386
Just read it.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.722
Well, the man obviously
needs a spelling Iesson,

21:05.806 --> 21:07.057
not to mention his grammar.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.975
Can we open the present now?

21:09.101 --> 21:11.144
Mom, you know what? Let's not open this.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.312
No, this is ridiculous.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.563
Oh, my God!

21:14.648 --> 21:17.233
- It's a dead rat.
- I know.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.444
What does this mean?

21:20.237 --> 21:22.447
AII rats die.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.327
Oh, my God. George.

21:32.458 --> 21:37.128
Don't move. Just stay here, okay?

21:38.339 --> 21:39.756
Don't move.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.592
Stay here.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.264
George Needleman?

21:48.724 --> 21:49.724
Yes.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.018
FBI. You're under arrest.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.937
No!

21:58.692 --> 22:00.652
I can't believe this.

22:01.028 --> 22:04.989
You can't make bail.
Your accounts are frozen, George.

22:05.908 --> 22:08.326
Well, here's the thing.

22:09.620 --> 22:13.498
I haven't done anything wrong.
I just wanna go home.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.208
That's not gonna happen.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.627
The Malone family
is trying to kill you, George.

22:18.129 --> 22:21.506
We've been given orders
to keep you protected.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.425
What does that mean?

22:23.509 --> 22:25.552
It means you and your family
are coming with us.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.266
We have a problem with Needleman.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.517
What happened?

22:32.601 --> 22:33.643
I think Malone's boys know

22:33.727 --> 22:35.687
that we're gonna offer him a chance
to testify against them,

22:35.771 --> 22:36.855
so they sent their signature.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.064
Is he all right?

22:38.149 --> 22:39.816
Yeah, we're getting him out of there now.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.318
Good, I'll get on the phone
with the US Marshals right away...

22:42.403 --> 22:45.613
No, no. No, no. They can't go
into one of our regular safe houses.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.366
The Malones have penetrated
our guys before.

22:48.742 --> 22:52.704
You can't make bail.
Your accounts are frozen, George.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.040
Well, here's the thing.

22:57.334 --> 23:01.212
I haven't done anything wrong.
I just wanna go home.

23:01.297 --> 23:02.922
That's not gonna happen.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.341
The Malone family
is trying to kill you, George.

23:05.843 --> 23:09.220
We've been given orders
to keep you protected.

23:09.847 --> 23:11.139
What does that mean?

23:11.223 --> 23:13.266
It means you and your family
are coming with us.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.980
We have a problem with Needleman.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.231
What happened?

23:20.316 --> 23:21.357
I think Malone's boys know

23:21.442 --> 23:23.401
that we're gonna offer him a chance
to testify against them,

23:23.486 --> 23:24.569
so they sent their signature.

23:24.653 --> 23:25.778
Is he all right?

23:25.863 --> 23:27.530
Yeah, we're getting him out of there now.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.033
Good, I'll get on the phone
with the US Marshals right away...

23:30.117 --> 23:33.328
No, no. No, no. They can't go
into one of our regular safe houses.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.080
The Malones have penetrated
our guys before.

23:36.207 --> 23:38.249
- Now, get up.
- I'm up. I'm up.

23:38.375 --> 23:41.586
Probably dreaming about Skittles
and Coca-Cola and Pepsi,

23:41.712 --> 23:44.047
diet soda and Mountain Dew
and Honey Buns,

23:44.131 --> 23:46.007
and damn Krispy Kreme and everything else.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.133
So you're up?

23:47.259 --> 23:50.762
There you are, Sadie.
You must iron the sheets.

23:50.888 --> 23:54.307
Mr. Needleman gets very angry
if there are any wrinkles.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.770
Honey, who the hell is Sadie?

23:58.896 --> 24:00.897
Don't you use that kind of Ianguage with me.

24:00.981 --> 24:04.400
'Cause I'll have you fired.
Do you understand?

24:04.485 --> 24:07.320
Mrs. Needleman. Okay, I get it.

24:07.446 --> 24:11.449
The mall is open, but there
ain't nobody in there shopping.

24:11.533 --> 24:14.494
We need to move him
to someplace safe now.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.746
Good idea. What do you suggest?

24:16.830 --> 24:18.915
I don't know,
but first thing tomorrow morning,

24:18.999 --> 24:20.166
they're on a plane headed here.

24:20.251 --> 24:23.711
You figure it out and tell no one.
Not even me.

24:25.256 --> 24:26.798
Sir, I've got kids at my house.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.508
I don't know what I would do
with a whole family of...

24:28.592 --> 24:31.010
I don't know. You've been
a prosecutor for over a year.

24:31.095 --> 24:34.264
This is a big case for you, Brian. Handle it.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.892
George Needleman? Our guys should be
knocking at his door at any minute.

24:38.102 --> 24:39.185
Great.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.854
Well, it'd be great if we could get him
to testify against the Malones,

24:41.939 --> 24:42.981
but that may be a tall order.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.275
Okay, but no deal for him.

24:46.110 --> 24:48.778
Look, I'm tired of these people
sticking it to the poor.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.071
Sir, if we don't offer him a deal,

24:50.197 --> 24:53.449
what incentive does he have
to testify against the mob?

24:53.575 --> 24:56.786
It's very simple, Brian.

24:56.787 --> 24:57.954
Yes, sir.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.395
Jake.

25:23.564 --> 25:24.814
What you doing here?

25:26.066 --> 25:29.027
You know, I'm just helping your auntie out.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.445
What'd you do?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.113
I tried to rob her.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.449
Boy, what is wrong with you?
I thought you gave up the gang banging.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.409
- What the hell?
- I'm in trouble.

25:36.493 --> 25:40.538
My dad put me in charge of
the church's mortgage payoff fundraiser.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.998
I think I may have Iost the money.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.499
How?

25:43.792 --> 25:46.794
I invested in some company,
and now they won't return my calls.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.504
Jake, come on, man.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.340
I know, and he's gonna kill me!

25:50.424 --> 25:51.799
He just wanted
to pay the church's mortgage off

25:51.884 --> 25:53.468
so that he could retire in peace.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.554
Look what I did. And he's so sick.

25:56.638 --> 26:00.058
I mean, those people at the church told him
not to make me trustee of the money.

26:00.142 --> 26:02.894
But you know what my dad did?
"What your dad did, Jake?"

26:02.978 --> 26:05.563
My dad went up there and told them
I was a changed man!

26:05.647 --> 26:06.731
You know what else he said?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.649
He said, "Everybody deserves
a second chance."

26:08.734 --> 26:10.193
- Calm down, man.
- You know? He said, "Everybody."

26:10.277 --> 26:11.361
- Jake. Jake.
- He did that for me.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.863
- And you know what?
- Hey, hey, hey.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.157
Calm down before Madea comes out
and slaps the hell out of you.

26:16.450 --> 26:20.912
Look, Brian, I need you to help me
get this money back from Lockwise.

26:20.996 --> 26:24.123
Lockwise Industries? New York?

26:24.208 --> 26:25.500
Yeah.

26:28.045 --> 26:30.254
That is a Ponzi scheme, man.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.799
I don't know how I can help you
get any money back from there.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.092
We're investigating them.

26:34.176 --> 26:37.428
A Iot of people invest in these companies,
and those guys Iive this Iavish Iifestyle.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.555
They spend all the money,
so there is no money.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.182
And whatever the government can find,

26:41.266 --> 26:44.394
maybe it's pennies on the dollar
that they can get back to the investors.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.646
I don't know how I can help you, man.

26:46.730 --> 26:50.483
Brian, I got to get this money back.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.901
How much money you talking?

26:53.737 --> 26:55.655
$114,000.

26:56.198 --> 27:00.535
You were robbing Madea? Madea doesn't
have that kind of money. What were you...

27:01.537 --> 27:04.705
Jake, don't tell me you were gonna rob
a bunch of old women.

27:04.790 --> 27:09.710
How many Iittle old Iadies you think
you gonna have to rob to get $114,000?

27:09.795 --> 27:13.005
114,000.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.299
Boy, get your ass off my porch
and go home!

27:15.384 --> 27:16.801
Yes, ma'am!

27:18.679 --> 27:20.721
Help me get this money back.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.767
Oh, man. Auntie Madea, man.

27:25.561 --> 27:26.561
What am I doing?

27:26.937 --> 27:28.896
Hey, hey, Madea.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.107
Hey, Brian. Hey, Brian.

27:31.442 --> 27:32.525
Hey.

27:32.609 --> 27:33.860
I don't know why the hell
you go in the bathroom

27:33.944 --> 27:35.153
and Ieave the toilet seat up, Mabel.

27:35.237 --> 27:36.612
Hey, Daddy.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.072
Do I know you?

27:39.158 --> 27:41.284
I'm past 18 now. You can stop pretending
Iike you don't know me,

27:41.368 --> 27:42.452
so you don't have to pay child support.

27:42.536 --> 27:45.538
Hey, son. How you doing?
I Iove you so much. So good to see you.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.457
You want something to eat?
I'm making a sandwich for Joe.

27:47.541 --> 27:50.793
I wouldn't eat that, son.
I wouldn't eat that at all.

27:50.878 --> 27:53.629
I believe she be trying to kill me
for my insurance money.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.715
You ain't got no insurance money.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.968
In that case, I'm gonna eat this sandwich
she done made.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.636
I'm not trying to kill you
for no insurance money.

28:00.721 --> 28:01.721
I'm gonna kill you 'cause I want you dead.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.222
I just want you completely dead.

28:03.348 --> 28:07.393
Just no Iife in you at all. Just not breathing.
Just maggot food.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.813
Here, son, try to taste that for me.

28:10.898 --> 28:13.232
Hey, I'm not tasting that. Thank you.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.401
What you doing here, son? What you want?

28:16.069 --> 28:17.904
Well, I wanted to talk to you, Madea. I have...

28:18.030 --> 28:19.489
You want some money or something?
I ain't got no money.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.407
You don't need to be coming over here
asking me for no money.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.367
Daddy, I didn't ask you for any money.

28:24.328 --> 28:25.745
Good. Then Ioan me some,

28:25.829 --> 28:28.915
'cause I need a Iittle change
for my Friday night Iights.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.416
What are you talking about?

28:30.501 --> 28:35.171
I be running them hoes, dawg.
I be running them hoes.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.423
Shut up, fool.

28:38.008 --> 28:40.676
I ain't got no money either, Brian.
What you want? What you come by here for?

28:40.761 --> 28:42.678
Well, I came by with a proposition.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.014
I just thought, you know,
you might wanna make a Iittle extra money.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.599
You know, the Iast time a man told me

28:46.683 --> 28:48.935
he had an opportunity for me
to make a Iittle money,

28:49.061 --> 28:52.522
I ended up in Mexico,
chained to 20 other women,

28:52.606 --> 28:54.857
walking down the street, just selling myself.

28:54.942 --> 28:56.526
You do need some money, don't you?

28:56.610 --> 28:58.027
Yeah, I could always use
a Iittle bit of money.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.445
Hell, things been tight around here.

28:59.571 --> 29:02.031
I was even thinking about
going back to my old job.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.450
- Stripping?
- No.

29:04.535 --> 29:06.118
- Hooking?
- No.

29:06.203 --> 29:07.954
- Robbing?
- No.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.748
- Hit man?
- No.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.501
Slinging?

29:14.169 --> 29:15.336
No.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.713
I did have some hustle
back in my day, though.

29:17.798 --> 29:21.175
I was doing a thing.
I was doing a thing back then.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.885
I done got the better now.

29:22.970 --> 29:26.138
Good those days are over here,
'cause you too big to be on a pole, Mabel.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.183
I'm gonna tell you right now about that pole.
You know, they done switched them.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.309
When you was back there dancing,

29:30.435 --> 29:32.353
they had them telephone poles
you used to swing on.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.689
Now, they got them Iittle brass poles.
I seen them.

29:34.815 --> 29:36.274
You'd bend or broke one of them.
You'll bend it.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.276
Your big ass'll break that brass.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.903
Big ass and brass don't mix.

29:40.988 --> 29:44.949
Joe, shut up, please. Just die.
Stop breathing. Okay? Stop breathing.

29:45.033 --> 29:48.119
I'm talking about going back to work
at an old folks' home where I used to work.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.288
No, no, you don't have to do that.
I got a great idea.

29:51.707 --> 29:53.541
AII right, here's the situation.

29:53.667 --> 29:56.002
I've got five people
that are in a Iittle bit of trouble.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.920
One of them is a witness
on a case that I'm working on.

29:58.005 --> 30:00.298
And I was wondering
if they could stay here for a while.

30:00.382 --> 30:03.718
Just for a couple of months
until the trial is over, maybe?

30:03.844 --> 30:05.678
Here? No.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.555
You better shut that up now.
Ain't nobody coming up in here.

30:07.681 --> 30:08.681
Hell to the no. Ain't nobody...

30:08.807 --> 30:11.142
You better hush that up now.
Ain't nobody coming up in here.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.602
- Daddy.
- What?

30:12.686 --> 30:14.020
No, that's just crazy.

30:14.146 --> 30:19.358
Have some criminal up in this house,
Iooking all crazy, and police Iooking...

30:19.484 --> 30:23.904
Hell, that's how Mabel Iive every day,
ain't it? That's your Iife.

30:24.031 --> 30:25.031
Shut up, rectum.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.366
Go to hell.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.702
- Now, get up.
- I'm up. I'm up.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.039
Probably dreaming about Skittles
and Coca-Cola and Pepsi,

30:33.165 --> 30:35.499
diet soda and Mountain Dew
and Honey Buns,

30:35.584 --> 30:37.460
and damn Krispy Kreme and everything else.

30:37.544 --> 30:38.586
So you're up?

30:38.712 --> 30:42.214
There you are, Sadie.
You must iron the sheets.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.760
Mr. Needleman gets very angry
if there are any wrinkles.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.222
Honey, who the hell is Sadie?

30:50.349 --> 30:52.350
Don't you use that kind of Ianguage with me.

30:52.434 --> 30:55.853
'Cause I'll have you fired.
Do you understand?

30:55.937 --> 30:58.773
Mrs. Needleman. Okay, I get it.

30:58.899 --> 31:02.902
The mall is open, but there
ain't nobody in there shopping.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.112
Is somebody after them?

31:06.156 --> 31:07.323
Yes, ma'am.

31:07.407 --> 31:11.827
But, wait a minute.
I would not ask you to do this.

31:11.912 --> 31:14.080
You're my aunt. I know they'll be safe here.

31:14.164 --> 31:17.416
Not one person would know they're here.
This is the safest place for them.

31:17.542 --> 31:20.503
That's some bull.
He's trying to sell you a Ioad of bull.

31:21.254 --> 31:23.005
- What'd they do?
- I can't tell you that.

31:23.090 --> 31:25.383
But I can tell you this. I can tell you this.

31:25.509 --> 31:30.596
You know, you, you pack. You know?
Ain't nobody gonna mess with you.

31:30.722 --> 31:31.847
And this is the safest place for them.

31:31.932 --> 31:35.601
You could be Iike their
witness protector, Madea.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.687
Look here, don't be trying
to butter me up and all that stuff.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.439
I see what you're trying to butter me up.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.108
Yeah, I know I'm packing.

31:42.234 --> 31:45.277
I know I can hold some things down,
but, no, I don't want nobody up in here.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.612
I'm sorry. Absolutely not.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.365
I cannot do that. You're gonna have to find
somewhere else for them to go.

31:49.449 --> 31:52.368
The answer's a flat-out no,
and I am not changing my mind.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.954
My no mean "no," my yes mean "yes."

31:55.038 --> 31:57.206
And my "maybe" mean "get the hell out."
I'm sorry.

31:57.290 --> 32:00.626
Absolutely not. Flat-out no.
Ain't gonna happen. Get on out of here. No.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.378
Too bad, then.

32:02.462 --> 32:06.132
I'll just tell my boss we'll have to find
somewhere else for them to stay.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.428
Guess some other Iucky person
will make that $4,000 a month.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.805
You know what?

32:12.931 --> 32:16.058
I believe it would be the greatest
Christianity thing I could do

32:16.143 --> 32:17.309
to help somebody in need.

32:17.394 --> 32:20.312
So I'm gonna go ahead
and make up these sheets and clean up.

32:20.397 --> 32:23.315
Mabel, you know, I believe I'm gonna go
drag that cot out of that garage.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.651
I got a cot back there,
and we can put a sheet up in my room.

32:25.777 --> 32:29.155
We could share, make sure we got
enough room for everybody up in here.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.489
So is that a yes?

32:30.615 --> 32:32.825
Ain't nothing wrong with that cot.
Ain't nothing wrong with it at all.

32:32.951 --> 32:36.078
Got a Iittle mold growing in it, but that's
all right. As Iong as you don't breathe...

33:14.367 --> 33:15.951
Where the hell are we?

33:16.036 --> 33:17.620
Honey, we are in the South.

33:17.704 --> 33:18.787
Yes, ma'am.

33:18.872 --> 33:22.541
And it brings back pretty fond memories.

33:22.626 --> 33:23.709
Of what, Grams?

33:24.377 --> 33:27.379
A boat and a man, and...

33:27.464 --> 33:30.049
My, he had such a big...

33:32.636 --> 33:33.886
Boat.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.806
Hi. George?

33:38.558 --> 33:40.893
Yes, I'm George,

33:41.019 --> 33:45.731
and this is my daughter, Cindy,
and my wife, Kate, and my son, Howie,

33:45.857 --> 33:47.816
- and my mother, Barbara.
- Hi, how are you?

33:49.236 --> 33:51.320
The man in the boat.

33:58.078 --> 33:59.828
Don't have a clue.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.208
Cute man.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.420
Well, I'm Brian Simmons,

34:08.505 --> 34:11.005
and I just want all of you to know
you're gonna be in safe hands, okay?

34:11.091 --> 34:12.257
I'm a federal prosecutor,

34:12.342 --> 34:14.342
and we have a very safe place for you
and the entire family.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.101
Well, here we go, kids.

34:23.311 --> 34:24.353
This way, ma'am.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.771
Place Iooks haunted.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.067
Is this neighborhood safe?

34:31.069 --> 34:33.320
- It's very safe.
- Okay.

34:33.446 --> 34:37.074
There's no safer place
for you and your family. Trust me.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.246
This is not a hotel.

34:44.623 --> 34:47.793
Okay, Madea's gonna Iove this one.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.466
Madea?

34:55.635 --> 34:56.969
How's my favorite aunt, Madea?

34:58.346 --> 34:59.597
That Brian? Come on in.

34:59.973 --> 35:02.266
The family's here
that I was telling you about.

35:19.159 --> 35:20.451
Hello.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.000
Brian, what the hell's going on?

35:28.126 --> 35:31.545
Madea, this is the family
that I was telling you about.

35:35.050 --> 35:38.344
You forgot to mention one Iittle
important thing about this family.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.138
What's that?

35:44.184 --> 35:46.018
Don't play with me.

35:47.187 --> 35:49.188
Madea, these are the Needlemans,

35:49.314 --> 35:51.440
and they'll be staying with you
for a few months.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.525
What? Months?

35:54.194 --> 35:56.403
Are you joking? What, is he joking?

35:56.529 --> 35:57.655
Cindy.

35:57.739 --> 36:00.032
Dad, I can't stay here.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.117
What, are we sharecroppers now?

36:02.202 --> 36:04.161
Honey, not nice.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.246
Hi, I'm George.

36:06.373 --> 36:08.165
And I'm his mother, Barbara.

36:08.249 --> 36:11.043
And I'm his wife, Kate,
and these are our kids, Howie and Cindy.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.796
I'm his child. I'm not her daughter.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.214
Dad, I can't stay here.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.883
You know, I think it's kind of nice here.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.551
- I Iike it.
- Yeah, you would, you moron.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.887
- Would you...
- This is great. Just great.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.890
- Honey.
- Yeah, "vacation" my ass.

36:25.392 --> 36:26.892
Hello, trip from hell.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.858
Okay. Look here,

36:35.860 --> 36:39.321
would y'all go on into the Iiving room
and have a seat, please?

36:39.406 --> 36:42.950
I would Iike to talk to my nephew
in private just a moment.

36:43.076 --> 36:44.451
Thank you so much for...

36:44.577 --> 36:47.121
It's gonna be so Iovely
having all of y'all here.

36:47.247 --> 36:49.998
Yes, just wonderful. Wonderful.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.917
We'll be right in.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.636
- What did you do that for?
- What the hell wrong with you?

37:03.388 --> 37:06.265
You done brought these folks up
in this house. What is wrong with you?

37:07.100 --> 37:09.685
Madea, Iisten. Okay,
I know that they're not African-American.

37:09.769 --> 37:11.562
I don't care nothing
about the color of their skin.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.565
I wanna know how in the hell
I'm supposed to hide five white folks

37:14.649 --> 37:17.484
in a neighborhood where we ain't even got
white cats or white cars.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.028
Ain't nothing white around here.
If the police come in this neighborhood,

37:20.113 --> 37:22.322
they don't even come in a white car.
They send a black SUV.

37:22.449 --> 37:26.702
I understand, but Iisten, Iisten.
I know that you can figure it out.

37:26.786 --> 37:27.786
I know you'll work it out.

37:27.871 --> 37:32.666
Boy, hear me clearly and good
when I say this to you.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.461
Son, I don't know how to hide these people.

37:35.545 --> 37:39.798
You can do it. $4,000 a month. $4,000.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.467
You ain't Iistening to me, son.

37:41.551 --> 37:43.594
These people are gonna stick out
around here

37:43.678 --> 37:46.346
Iike I would stick out
at a Republica Convention.

37:46.473 --> 37:49.808
Do I Iook Iike I'm a Newt Ginger fan?
Do I Iook Iike I Iike Newt Gingery?

37:49.893 --> 37:53.687
Madea, okay, okay. But you'll figure it out.
I know you'll figure it out.

37:56.149 --> 37:57.983
Are we sitting on plastic?

37:58.693 --> 38:00.319
Mabel, I can't find the phone book.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.529
I'm trying to find somebody.
Where are the White Pages?

38:03.072 --> 38:04.740
My.

38:05.575 --> 38:07.493
The man in the boat.

38:10.163 --> 38:11.663
Hello.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.336
Hey.

38:30.850 --> 38:33.185
Mabel, they white folks.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.354
Really? I didn't notice.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.856
Come on. I'll introduce you.

38:40.026 --> 38:44.696
Needleman family, this is my father, Joe.
You already met my Aunt Madea.

38:47.116 --> 38:52.371
Dad, this is Howie, Kate, George, Cindy,
and Barbara.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.583
It Iooks Iike she's undressing me
with her eyes.

38:59.420 --> 39:02.005
Now, I'm sure that the agents told you,
but I just want to reiterate.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.716
You can't have any contact with anyone
from your past as Iong as you're here.

39:04.801 --> 39:05.843
Do you understand?

39:05.927 --> 39:07.052
Dad?

39:07.387 --> 39:09.096
Honey, I'm sorry.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.099
This is crazy.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.726
You suck.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.855
Did she just say... I know she...

39:17.939 --> 39:19.606
Did that child just say
she sucked to her daddy?

39:19.732 --> 39:23.777
Lord, have mercy.
What generation is this? You can't...

39:24.404 --> 39:27.155
You better hurry up
and get them the hell out of here.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.783
Mabel gonna kill that Iittle girl.

39:29.868 --> 39:33.495
But, Cindy, this is only until the trial is over.
Isn't that right, Brian?

39:33.580 --> 39:36.123
Yes, just until the trial is over.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.041
I hate you.

39:38.668 --> 39:41.461
That girl says she hate him. Oh, Lord,
somebody gonna have to help me.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.672
God, help me. God, help me.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.550
George, I know it's been
a rough day for you, so I tell you what.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.886
I'll come by tomorrow morning about 9:00,
pick you up.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.096
We'll go to the office
and begin working on this case, okay?

39:53.224 --> 39:56.059
So, Madea, why don't you show your
house guests where they'll be staying?

39:56.144 --> 39:59.271
Yeah, go on and show them, Mabel.
I ain't trying to go up there with them.

39:59.355 --> 40:03.150
That one right there,
I don't Iike the way she's Iooking at me.

40:03.234 --> 40:06.236
Well, you can show me to the door.
I'm getting back on that plane.

40:06.321 --> 40:07.654
- Honey.
- Excuse us.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.407
- You don't talk Iike that. Watch your mouth.
- Are you kidding me? Seriously.

40:10.491 --> 40:11.700
Your ass trying to get me a case.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.619
That's what you trying to do.
You're trying to get me a case.

40:14.329 --> 40:17.331
Better get a speedy trial.
I'm gonna tell you that right now.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.292
I'll get a speedy trial.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.465
What's happening to us?

40:27.508 --> 40:30.218
Kate, if I'd known

40:30.303 --> 40:33.722
that taking care of my family
would Iead us to this, I would've...

40:33.806 --> 40:36.600
This wasn't about family.
This was about you.

40:36.684 --> 40:39.061
We have way more than we needed.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.606
This was about greed.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.149
You know, sweetheart,

40:44.233 --> 40:48.737
I seem to recall you were very happy
with my promotion, too.

40:48.821 --> 40:50.238
What were you thinking?

40:51.574 --> 40:56.244
I don't know.
I wasn't even aware this was going on.

40:56.329 --> 40:59.581
You're not aware
of a Iot of things going on now.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.835
- Kate...
- I don't wanna talk about this.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.380
I'm gonna unpack my bag and go to sleep.

41:06.464 --> 41:09.049
We're done. It's done.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.762
It's gonna end just Iike that?

41:13.846 --> 41:15.305
Come on, man. Don't Iet her pimp you.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.557
She wanna go to sleep? Knock her ass out.

41:17.934 --> 41:20.894
Joe, shut the hell up.
They're having a private conversation

41:20.979 --> 41:23.480
in a room about not being aware
of what's going on.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.565
If he ain't aware,
that is between the two of them.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.610
Shut up. Let them have
their private moment, please.

41:28.695 --> 41:32.364
When a door is closed, that mean
you ain't supposed to be Iistening.

41:32.448 --> 41:34.866
Leave them people alone. Shut the hell up.

41:34.951 --> 41:36.827
- Mabel, you shut up.
- No, you shut the hell up.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.954
Mabel, I'm older than you.
I'll do whatever the hell I want to do.

41:39.038 --> 41:40.539
Yeah, it's my house.
You gonna shut up up in here

41:40.623 --> 41:42.499
or I'm gonna come up and
cut your vocal cords out.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.084
You ain't gonna be able to say
a damn thing!

41:44.293 --> 41:45.293
Good night.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.058
What the hell?

42:02.437 --> 42:04.479
Boy! Boy!

42:08.985 --> 42:10.652
Is that you farting, son?

42:11.529 --> 42:13.280
It wasn't me.

42:14.198 --> 42:15.699
Fart one more time.
That's all I'm gonna tell you.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.576
Fart one more time.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.121
In here farting Iike that.

42:21.873 --> 42:25.000
What's wrong with you, boy?
That's doggone insane.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.877
Hello, Joe.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.588
You wanna give it a go?

42:31.466 --> 42:33.175
Mabel.

42:34.886 --> 42:38.472
Mabel, they trying to get me.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.308
No, no, trying to get me

42:41.392 --> 42:44.352
Iike they get them football players
and them basketball players.

42:44.437 --> 42:48.732
I don't think so. No, no, no.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.317
I won't bite.

43:10.254 --> 43:12.756
Lord, Lord, Lord.

43:15.968 --> 43:17.511
You staring at me?

43:19.472 --> 43:23.100
No, no, I wasn't staring at you.

43:23.184 --> 43:24.392
Okay.

43:25.228 --> 43:28.396
I was watching the wildebeest
in its natural habitat, though.

43:28.481 --> 43:30.148
Excuse me?

43:33.653 --> 43:34.820
That's not nice.

43:34.904 --> 43:39.157
Yeah. Her butt must be hungry,
'cause it's chewing that dress alive.

43:41.869 --> 43:45.539
If you need anything, anything at all,

43:47.250 --> 43:49.668
I'm just a whisper away.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.545
AII you got to do is whisper.

43:56.425 --> 43:58.552
Okay, I think I'm done.

43:59.262 --> 44:01.388
Where you rushing off to?

44:02.682 --> 44:04.850
- Yoga's over.
- Okay.

44:04.934 --> 44:06.017
Creepy.

44:06.102 --> 44:07.435
- Hi.
- How you doing?

44:07.520 --> 44:09.771
- I'm good. Thank you.
- I see you was up in there doing that yoda.

44:09.856 --> 44:12.190
It's yoga.

44:12.275 --> 44:14.317
No, baby, I don't have no yogurt.
I don't eat that.

44:14.402 --> 44:17.863
That mess my stomach up.
It's got that abiffidus bacalarus in it.

44:17.947 --> 44:19.948
I can't have that. So you go on
and get yourself something else.

44:20.032 --> 44:22.784
I might have some in that fridge there,
but I don't eat it.

44:22.869 --> 44:24.077
Well, it Iooks Iike you've been cooking.

44:24.203 --> 44:26.329
Yeah, I wanted to feed your family
their first day in my house.

44:26.414 --> 44:28.707
I wanted to make sure
y'all had something really good to eat.

44:28.791 --> 44:33.545
So I got some waffles, some biscuits,
I got some pancakes, I got some bacon,

44:33.629 --> 44:35.547
I got ham. I put a Iot of butter on the ham,

44:35.631 --> 44:37.465
a Iot of salt and pepper,
make it nice and flavorful.

44:37.550 --> 44:38.842
I got oatmeal on the stove.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.218
I got sausage,

44:40.303 --> 44:42.804
and I got eggs and grits and everything else.

44:42.889 --> 44:44.723
Y'all betterjust feast.

44:46.809 --> 44:48.393
It Iooks so good.

44:48.477 --> 44:51.354
It's a Iot of carbs. You Iike carbs?

44:51.439 --> 44:52.772
- It's a Iot of...
- Carbs.

44:52.899 --> 44:54.983
No, baby, I don't eat crabs.
You can't eat no crabs.

44:55.067 --> 44:57.819
You gonna have crabs and yogurt?
You about to mess your stomach up.

44:57.904 --> 45:00.155
Ain't no seafood on here, honey.
I'm allergic to seafood.

45:00.239 --> 45:01.573
Ain't no seafood here nowhere.

45:01.657 --> 45:03.408
Is that how you stay so thin?

45:03.492 --> 45:06.036
No, honey, I don't eat that stuff.
Where your family?

45:06.120 --> 45:08.205
They're sleeping still.

45:08.289 --> 45:10.957
What? They got to get up.

45:11.500 --> 45:14.628
No, baby, your children got to go to school.
I got to get them registered,

45:14.754 --> 45:17.214
and George is supposed to see Brian
down at the attorney's office.

45:17.298 --> 45:19.090
So, no, no, no, you got to get them up.

45:19.175 --> 45:21.843
Okay, well, I was just gonna Iet...
You know, they're so exhausted.

45:21.928 --> 45:24.179
- No, I'll go get them up. Here, you take this.
- Okay.

45:24.263 --> 45:25.472
Take this and stir that real good.

45:25.598 --> 45:27.641
- Whip it real, real good. You understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

45:27.767 --> 45:29.768
AII right, you need to put something... Here.

45:29.852 --> 45:31.603
Here, put this on.
Put this on while you whip.

45:31.687 --> 45:33.188
- You don't wanna get that on you.
- Okay. No.

45:33.272 --> 45:34.481
- Put that on. Okay, whip it.
- Thank you.

45:34.607 --> 45:36.650
- Whip it real good.
- I will.

45:41.864 --> 45:44.449
George, get up out this bed, son.

45:48.871 --> 45:50.038
Kate.

45:51.457 --> 45:53.792
I had this horrible dream

45:54.126 --> 45:57.587
that we were in trouble with the FBI,

45:57.672 --> 46:01.633
and we moved into this house
with an old woman who Iooked Iike...

46:03.219 --> 46:04.302
Like what?

46:05.388 --> 46:06.513
You.

46:07.556 --> 46:11.184
It's not a dream. It's really happening.

46:11.644 --> 46:13.353
I'm in so deep.

46:15.690 --> 46:18.817
George, you need to get up out this bed.
Brian is waiting for you down at the office.

46:18.901 --> 46:20.610
He said he was gonna have you
come down there this morning.

46:20.695 --> 46:22.445
Now, get up on out this bed.

46:22.530 --> 46:25.699
My Iife is over.
I'm not getting out of this bed.

46:25.825 --> 46:28.034
There's no reason to get out of this bed.

46:28.160 --> 46:31.538
You need a reason? You need a reason?

46:33.749 --> 46:36.251
You better get your ass out this bed.

46:40.881 --> 46:43.258
Is that enough reason for you?

46:43.342 --> 46:44.426
Let me tell you something, son.

46:44.510 --> 46:47.512
I don't allow nobody to feel sorry
for themselves in my house.

46:47.596 --> 46:49.389
I don't know what you did.
I don't care what you did.

46:49.515 --> 46:50.515
Do you understand?

46:50.599 --> 46:52.183
I need you to get up out this bed,
come downstairs,

46:52.268 --> 46:55.103
have breakfast with your family,
Brian is waiting on you down at the office

46:55.187 --> 46:56.521
to talk about
whatever y'all need to talk about.

46:56.605 --> 46:59.983
It ain't my business. I don't wanna know,
but you gonna get up out this bed.

47:00.067 --> 47:01.943
If I come back up these stairs,
and you still in this bed,

47:02.028 --> 47:03.653
do you have any idea what I'm gonna do?

47:03.738 --> 47:07.032
I'm gonna get completely naked,
and get up in there with you and spoon.

47:08.242 --> 47:09.492
I'm up.

47:09.577 --> 47:10.577
Thank you.

47:10.703 --> 47:13.955
I am definitely up.
You don't have to come back.

47:14.040 --> 47:17.417
I'm coming right down.
I'm coming right down.

47:19.253 --> 47:20.879
I'm on my way.

47:32.016 --> 47:33.058
Get up, son.

47:35.895 --> 47:36.936
What's wrong?

47:37.897 --> 47:39.689
You just scared me.

47:39.774 --> 47:44.069
You're just so huge.
Like a giant bag of Skittles.

47:45.529 --> 47:47.822
AII right, you better get the hell up,

47:47.907 --> 47:49.741
or when I come back up in here,
you know what's gonna happen?

47:49.867 --> 47:52.243
You gonna taste the rainbow.

47:52.328 --> 47:55.288
We need to move him
to someplace safe now.

47:55.373 --> 47:57.540
Good idea. What do you suggest?

47:57.625 --> 47:59.709
I don't know,
but first thing tomorrow morning,

47:59.794 --> 48:00.960
they're on a plane headed here.

48:01.045 --> 48:04.506
You figure it out and tell no one.
Not even me.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.592
Sir, I've got kids at my house.

48:07.676 --> 48:09.302
I don't know what I would do
with a whole family of...

48:09.387 --> 48:11.805
I don't know. You've been
a prosecutor for over a year.

48:11.889 --> 48:15.058
This is a big case for you, Brian. Handle it.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.435
- Now, get up.
- I'm up. I'm up.

48:17.561 --> 48:20.772
Probably dreaming about Skittles
and Coca-Cola and Pepsi,

48:20.898 --> 48:23.233
diet soda and Mountain Dew
and Honey Buns,

48:23.317 --> 48:25.193
and damn Krispy Kreme and everything else.

48:25.277 --> 48:26.319
So you're up?

48:26.445 --> 48:29.948
There you are, Sadie.
You must iron the sheets.

48:30.074 --> 48:33.493
Mr. Needleman gets very angry
if there are any wrinkles.

48:36.122 --> 48:37.956
Honey, who the hell is Sadie?

48:38.082 --> 48:40.083
Don't you use that kind of Ianguage with me.

48:40.167 --> 48:43.586
'Cause I'll have you fired.
Do you understand?

48:43.671 --> 48:46.506
Mrs. Needleman. Okay, I get it.

48:46.632 --> 48:50.635
The mall is open, but there
ain't nobody in there shopping.

48:52.429 --> 48:53.555
What's that smell?

48:53.639 --> 48:56.141
It's called food. I'm cooking.

48:56.267 --> 48:59.269
It smells up the whole house. It permeates.

48:59.353 --> 49:04.149
Thank you. You always were
the best colored help we could ever find.

49:06.485 --> 49:09.279
Okay, Brian playing a joke on me.

49:09.363 --> 49:12.740
I'm being Punk'd. I know I'm being Punk'd.
Where the camera at?

49:12.825 --> 49:14.784
Little girl, I need you to get up, honey.

49:14.869 --> 49:16.661
Go away.

49:22.209 --> 49:26.212
Never had no child talk to me
Iike this before. Lordy.

49:26.338 --> 49:30.216
Honey, I got to bring y'all down to school
and get you registered. Now, get up.

49:32.344 --> 49:34.137
I said, go away.

49:36.724 --> 49:39.851
She just yelled at me in my house.
I don't know what she...

49:39.977 --> 49:41.269
Little girl,
I'm gonna tell you one more time...

49:41.353 --> 49:43.396
I said, go away!

49:51.197 --> 49:52.989
I know she didn't just...

49:58.162 --> 50:00.163
Who the hell you think
you talking to?

50:02.166 --> 50:05.084
Oh, my God! What is wrong with you?

50:05.211 --> 50:07.253
This is my house.

50:07.379 --> 50:09.881
You Iive by my rules
when you are in my house.

50:10.007 --> 50:12.175
You're too young for that, Iittle girl.
You don't want none of this.

50:12.259 --> 50:16.262
Please, do yourself a favor, honey.
You do not want none of this.

50:16.388 --> 50:19.432
Behave while you're here. If not, you will...

50:22.895 --> 50:25.021
Girl, you...

50:25.105 --> 50:27.690
Girl, you just don't know...

50:31.445 --> 50:33.404
I don't know who she thinks
she's talking to.

50:33.739 --> 50:35.198
She's insane.

50:39.703 --> 50:40.703
Hello?

50:41.455 --> 50:42.622
Is that you, son?

50:45.251 --> 50:47.585
- Yes, sir.
- Well, come on in here.

50:50.047 --> 50:51.714
What are you doing here, Dad?

50:52.424 --> 50:54.592
Well, I'm feeling better, much better.

50:54.718 --> 50:58.763
No, you're not.
You're supposed to be at home in bed.

50:58.889 --> 51:02.934
I just had to stop by here
to make sure everything's all right.

51:03.435 --> 51:04.435
It's all fine.

51:04.937 --> 51:10.692
I've decided to tell the church
the third Sunday I'm retiring.

51:11.151 --> 51:13.152
I thought you were gonna wait
till summer to do that.

51:13.279 --> 51:16.698
No, I can't do that, son. I'm too tired.

51:16.782 --> 51:19.200
It'll sure make the burden so much easier

51:19.285 --> 51:24.247
to know that everything I've worked for
all these years is gonna be Iooked after.

51:24.331 --> 51:27.625
I am very proud of you, son.
Really proud of you.

51:28.961 --> 51:30.878
Don't be proud of me.

51:30.963 --> 51:33.506
Are you kidding me?
I have to tell you I'm proud of you.

51:33.632 --> 51:36.759
You know something?
After your mother died,

51:36.844 --> 51:38.136
I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.

51:39.179 --> 51:42.265
You were so far out there in those streets.

51:42.349 --> 51:44.183
But, praise the Lord, Iook at you now.

51:44.310 --> 51:48.938
Helping me run the church,
handling our mortgage payment fund.

51:49.023 --> 51:50.648
No, I am very proud of you, son.

51:51.066 --> 51:53.443
You know, the congregation
is gonna be a Iittle bit upset

51:53.527 --> 51:57.488
when I tell them that I'm retiring,
so to ease the pain,

51:57.573 --> 52:01.701
I'm going to tell them that we have raised
the money to pay off the church.

52:03.203 --> 52:04.954
They're gonna rejoice.

52:06.332 --> 52:07.790
Well done, son.

52:07.875 --> 52:09.208
Yes, sir.

52:18.510 --> 52:21.929
I don't see her out here. Y'all come on.
Come on. Hurry up.

52:22.014 --> 52:25.391
She always nosy as hell,
over there Iooking at everything.

52:25.476 --> 52:26.851
Hurry up.

52:31.899 --> 52:34.484
- Come on. Get in the car.
- Madea.

52:34.568 --> 52:35.735
Madea.

52:35.944 --> 52:37.070
Hey, Hattie.

52:38.030 --> 52:39.197
How you doing?

52:39.281 --> 52:40.573
- I'm good, baby.
- Open the door.

52:40.657 --> 52:43.284
- Come here a minute.
- I can't talk to you right now, honey.

52:43.369 --> 52:46.287
This my cousins, and they done Iost
all the pigmentation in their skin overnight.

52:46.372 --> 52:47.663
- Your cousins?
- Yes.

52:47.748 --> 52:48.748
Can I help you?

52:48.832 --> 52:51.250
No, I got to take them
to the doctor right now.

52:51.335 --> 52:53.544
I'll see you Iater on. Take care.

52:58.300 --> 53:00.051
And that's all you know?

53:00.135 --> 53:02.428
That's all I know. I swear it.

53:02.763 --> 53:04.055
I don't believe you.

53:05.140 --> 53:07.225
I'm telling you the truth.

53:07.643 --> 53:10.645
You're going to jail for a very Iong time.

53:16.360 --> 53:20.655
I can't go to jail. I didn't do anything wrong.

53:20.739 --> 53:23.116
George, calm down, okay?

53:23.784 --> 53:26.869
For what it's worth, I believe you.

53:27.871 --> 53:31.916
Oh, boy, somebody believes me.
Isn't that wonderful?

53:32.000 --> 53:36.546
Let's crack open some champagne,
because somebody believes me.

53:37.506 --> 53:39.424
Oh, God, I'm in trouble.

53:42.928 --> 53:47.432
I think they can believe you, too,
but you have to help me make them believe.

53:48.183 --> 53:52.353
Just tell me what you want me to do.

53:52.438 --> 53:55.231
What do I need to do here?

53:55.315 --> 53:58.067
Okay, that's a good attitude, George.
Really good attitude.

53:58.152 --> 54:01.028
Everything that wasn't shredded
or destroyed is in these files.

54:01.113 --> 54:05.199
This is your ticket to freedom.
You're the CFO. I'm sure you can find it.

54:05.951 --> 54:07.160
Okay, well,

54:07.411 --> 54:11.998
this is the crux of the problem here, Brian,

54:12.082 --> 54:17.211
because I can't seem to find anything
in here that will help.

54:17.296 --> 54:19.172
I wanna help you. I really do.

54:19.256 --> 54:23.509
It doesn't make any sense
for me not to wanna help.

54:23.594 --> 54:26.304
Now does it? Does it? No. No.

54:26.388 --> 54:29.849
I mean, don't you think
I would help if I could?

54:33.604 --> 54:35.480
- Are you okay?
- No, I just...

54:35.564 --> 54:38.441
I feel Iike I... I wanna hit something.

54:38.525 --> 54:40.359
Hit the chair. Hit something.

54:50.954 --> 54:51.996
I'm sorry.

55:07.846 --> 55:09.931
That was a Iovely evening.

55:11.850 --> 55:14.352
There ain't never been no evening, Iady.
I don't know you.

55:14.853 --> 55:18.773
Stop it. There's no one around.

55:18.857 --> 55:21.859
Read my Iips, honey. I don't know you.

55:22.819 --> 55:25.363
You're the man in the boat.

55:25.489 --> 55:27.532
I ain't never had no boat.

55:31.328 --> 55:35.122
I bet if I showed you my tattoo,
you might remember.

55:35.207 --> 55:38.000
What tattoo? What you fixing to show me?

55:42.881 --> 55:45.550
I believe you need to see a doctor
about that, honey.

55:45.634 --> 55:48.886
No, that's Betty Boop.

55:50.889 --> 55:54.976
It might have been Betty Boop at one time,
but Betty Boop done drooped.

55:55.060 --> 55:56.644
Betty Boop.

55:56.728 --> 55:59.397
You brought me over in your Iittle boat.

55:59.523 --> 56:04.735
Lady, for the Iast time, okay?
First of all, you insulted me.

56:04.820 --> 56:06.153
'Cause I wouldn't have a Iittle boat.

56:06.238 --> 56:08.656
I'm not a canoe kind of man.
You understand?

56:08.740 --> 56:12.493
I'm a yacht, a cruise ship,
Noah's Ark up in this piece.

56:12.578 --> 56:15.746
Only time I was ever in a boat was
that Iittle rowboat belonged to the Army

56:15.872 --> 56:17.748
when I was in New Orleans many years ago.

56:17.833 --> 56:21.002
I'd take people across the water
over there from the bayou to the juke joint,

56:21.086 --> 56:22.503
and I'd charge them a nickel
to get them over there.

56:22.588 --> 56:25.006
And they'd all take the ride and everything.
I'd give them their change.

56:25.090 --> 56:28.426
And somebody gave me a 50-cent tip
that night.

56:34.016 --> 56:35.516
You Barbara Betty Boop.

56:35.601 --> 56:39.437
Yes, I was a nurse in Company B.

56:41.440 --> 56:44.609
Yeah, I was in Company C
over there with the colored troops.

56:44.735 --> 56:48.446
Me and a couple of my girlfriends followed
you guys all the way to your barracks.

56:48.572 --> 56:50.948
Yeah, I remember it was four of you.

56:51.074 --> 56:57.371
It was Blanche, Rose, Dorothy, and you.

57:00.626 --> 57:02.209
I don't even know
how you remember that, honey.

57:02.294 --> 57:05.212
That was 56, 57 years ago.

57:05.297 --> 57:07.381
Fifty-three.

57:07.466 --> 57:09.592
Because George is 52.

57:11.970 --> 57:13.888
What that got to do with anything?

57:16.308 --> 57:18.559
What day is it?

57:19.061 --> 57:22.605
Lady, don't you start...
What you trying to tell me?

57:24.608 --> 57:25.983
Where am I?

57:26.068 --> 57:28.736
I think you believe you're trying
to tell me something about George.

57:28.820 --> 57:30.571
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hey.

57:30.656 --> 57:32.406
I don't know where I am.

57:38.830 --> 57:40.122
George?

57:44.002 --> 57:45.086
- Brian.
- Jake.

57:45.170 --> 57:47.004
You cannot keep calling me Iike this, man.

57:47.130 --> 57:48.964
I'm in the middle of an investigation.
What are you doing?

57:49.591 --> 57:52.843
My dad wants to announce that he's paying
the church's mortgage off in three weeks.

57:52.928 --> 57:54.512
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

57:54.638 --> 57:56.347
Tell him the truth.

57:56.473 --> 57:57.515
That will kill him.

57:57.599 --> 57:59.934
He'll be very happy
that you told him the truth.

58:00.018 --> 58:01.602
I can't. I can't do it.

58:01.687 --> 58:02.937
Jake.

58:03.021 --> 58:05.022
That's him. That's the dude from the news!

58:05.691 --> 58:06.941
I ought to kill you!

58:07.025 --> 58:09.360
- Who is this?
- I'm your worst nightmare.

58:09.486 --> 58:10.778
Will you just...

58:10.862 --> 58:14.865
You're my worst... I got news for you.
I'm Iiving my worst nightmare, okay?

58:14.991 --> 58:18.035
And besides, you're a Iittle short
to be a nightmare, aren't you?

58:18.120 --> 58:20.705
I'm short? He called me...
He called me short?

58:20.789 --> 58:22.373
I'm gonna bust your balls!

58:22.457 --> 58:25.876
Well, why don't you get in Iine
and bust my balls?

58:26.002 --> 58:28.462
Because everybody else is busting my balls.

58:28.547 --> 58:31.674
I don't have any balls Ieft, mister!
How about that?

58:32.175 --> 58:34.051
I'm gonna... Get off.

58:34.511 --> 58:36.804
Calm down. Nobody's kicking balls.

58:36.888 --> 58:39.181
George, Jake, I need you both to calm down.

58:39.266 --> 58:40.725
Is everything all right out there?

58:40.851 --> 58:42.059
Everything's fine.

58:44.187 --> 58:45.980
Just keep working. It's all good.

58:46.690 --> 58:48.733
George, this is Jake.

58:49.401 --> 58:52.820
His father has a church,
and they were gonna pay off their mortgage,

58:52.904 --> 58:56.741
and they invested the money in Lockwise,
and they Iost it all.

58:56.825 --> 58:58.826
So he's a Iittle bit upset.

58:58.910 --> 59:01.495
- I'm sorry.
- You...

59:02.914 --> 59:04.623
That's all you got to say? Is you sorry?

59:04.708 --> 59:06.125
- Jake.
- Hell...

59:06.209 --> 59:08.461
Yeah. Okay, okay.
You better watch yourself,

59:08.545 --> 59:09.795
or I'm gonna give you a...

59:09.880 --> 59:13.507
You see this? Big five. Big five.
And you're gonna get it.

59:13.592 --> 59:15.926
If I didn't have to go to the bathroom,
you'd be in...

59:16.011 --> 59:17.845
- Where's the bathroom, Brian?
- Okay.

59:17.929 --> 59:19.054
Third door on the Ieft.

59:19.139 --> 59:21.056
- Third door on the Ieft.
- Yeah.

59:21.975 --> 59:23.350
Big five?

59:24.644 --> 59:27.605
Jake, go home.

59:28.899 --> 59:31.650
Get a grip, okay? Tell him the truth.

59:32.110 --> 59:34.153
If anything comes up, I'll call you.

59:34.237 --> 59:37.198
Can't you just go home?
Elevator's right there.

59:47.083 --> 59:48.876
How tall are you, son?

59:50.128 --> 59:52.963
About 6 feet.

59:53.298 --> 59:55.090
- About 6 feet?
- Yeah.

59:56.551 --> 59:58.719
Okay. Check.

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.057
You Iike soul music?

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:09.063
I do. I do. I Iove soul music.

01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:11.649
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:14.318
Find out what it mean to me.

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:16.237
No, I dig it.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:18.739
You dig it. You dig it?

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:21.992
Check.

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:30.501
Your hair's really thick and curly.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.087
Always been that thick and curly?

01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:34.839
Yeah, it has.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:37.758
When I was a kid, I had an afro that was,

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:41.512
you know, Iarge.

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:44.682
To here. Big, big hair.

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:48.394
No, you said it right. You had an afro.
You didn't offend me. You had an afro.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.271
That's what you called it, an afro. Check.

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:51.772
An afro.

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:56.777
Can you swim, son?

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.614
No. No.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:03.701
I never got the hang of swimming.

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:08.372
Never got the hang of it. Yup. Check.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:12.877
Hey, I was Iooking at your wife,
she was doing that yoda.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:15.671
And she got a nice Iittle butt.

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:18.215
But it ain't no booty, you know?

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:22.511
You Iike a butt, or you Iike a booty?

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:28.392
You Iike a booty, one that's a big, old booty
to grab Iike handlebars and use?

01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:31.729
Steer that thing where you want it to go,
you know?

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:34.565
To be honest,

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:35.900
I Iove my wife.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:38.402
She can't hear you. She can't hear.
Man-to-man, go on and tell me.

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:41.655
Do you Iike a Iittle cute, nice Iittle butt,
or do you Iike a big butt

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:44.366
that you can grab that thing
and slap it Iike handlebars?

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:50.247
Well, I would Iike
a Iittle more on the bottom.

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:51.749
Harley-Davidson.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:52.917
- A Harley?
- Yeah.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.418
Junk in the trunk.

01:01:54.502 --> 01:01:58.005
Some junk in the trunk. Yeah, more junk.

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:01.508
As Iong as you're asking.

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:07.014
I got one Iast question for you, son.

01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:11.936
When you go to the bathroom
and you're at the urinal,

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:14.939
do you stand there Iike this?

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:19.526
Or do you just happen
to stand there Iike this?

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.446
Well...

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:25.032
And when you're finished,
do you have to do this?

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:30.537
Which one is it for you, son? Which one?

01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:33.624
Well, more Iike the second part.

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:36.794
Without the thing at the end.

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:39.463
Check.

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:43.217
Damn. I'm your daddy.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.887
Excuse me?

01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:49.306
Do you have any Wi-Fi?

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:52.977
Well, if you ask me nice,
I'll get up and I'll make you some.

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:57.147
Excuse me. How do you make Wi-Fi?

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:01.652
Son, you use some flour,
put a Iittle water in it, some powdered sugar,

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:03.404
you mix it up real good,
and you get your skillet,

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:04.905
or you get you one of them Wi-Fi irons,

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:08.158
and you pour it in the Wi-Fi iron
and you close it up.

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:10.494
I got a Wi-Fi iron in there.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.246
What are you talking about?

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:16.667
He asked for a Wi-Fi, I got a waffle.
You want a Wi-Fi? I got a waffle.

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:18.961
Wi-Fi. Internet.

01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:22.673
I don't have none of that.

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:25.759
Ain't no technology around here at all.
We've been Ieft in the Dark Ages.

01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:28.262
It figures.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:29.430
Howie.

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.015
Honey, why do you need
to get on the Internet?

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.599
I'm supposed to do a report.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:35.019
I'll help you with your report. Okay, honey?

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:37.354
It doesn't really matter.
I mean, he's gonna fail.

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:40.107
- He's dumb Iike his mother.
- Enough.

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:41.775
Go to hell, Kate.

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:46.989
Did that child just say, "Go to hell"?

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:54.955
You all right?

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.957
Yeah. Thanks.

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:59.376
Come on, sit down and talk to me.

01:04:00.628 --> 01:04:03.756
That child right there. Lord, that Iittle girl
about to make me hurt her.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.800
I know. I'm trying to be understanding.

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:08.177
Of what?

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:10.846
She has problems.

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.014
Honey, we all got problems.

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:14.767
That child ain't supposed to be
talking to you all Iike that. That is crazy.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:17.603
What's wrong with that child?
What's she so angry about?

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:20.355
I don't know.
Just being here and out of school.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.149
Tell that to somebody else, honey.

01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:26.487
That child is angry about something else,
and it's deep, whatever it is.

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:31.158
It ain't about no school and nothing else.
This water runs deeper than that.

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:32.534
How do you know?

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:35.412
Wisdom. I didn't get this old
by not knowing nothing.

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:41.210
She thinks I'm the reason
that her father divorced her mother.

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.838
I wonder where she'd get that from.

01:04:44.923 --> 01:04:46.090
Are you?

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:48.842
No. What kind of person do you think I am?

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:51.095
A woman.

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:54.473
No, their marriage was over,

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:59.186
her father filed for divorce already,
but she's hated me ever since she met me.

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.688
And George just sit there,
don't say nothing?

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:03.315
He just sit there and not say a word?

01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:06.235
George doesn't say anything
to anyone these days.

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:08.195
Lord, have mercy.

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:10.030
I know. But she needs him.

01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:12.324
Because her mother, she is so evil.

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:15.828
She filled her head with all these
horrible things about me and about us.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.287
And then, two years ago,

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:20.833
she dropped her off at our doorstep,
hasn't contacted her ever since,

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.417
and now she's angry.

01:05:22.627 --> 01:05:24.878
And now she's up in my house
and she got me worried.

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:25.963
Honey, I'm just worried.

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:27.673
She'll be fine.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.633
I'm not worried about her,
I'm worried about me.

01:05:29.717 --> 01:05:31.510
'Cause I feel Iike I wanna choke her to sleep.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:33.804
I just wanna grab her
till the Iife is out of her sometimes.

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:35.013
She's so flip.

01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:36.431
Yeah, I get it.

01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:39.393
And when she talk back to you,
you just have a Iittle argument with her

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:42.146
and you just Iet her start her mouth
and say whatever she want to say?

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:43.313
Don't do that, honey.

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:46.859
You have to talk to her in a Ianguage
that she understand.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.653
You got to Iearn
how to start speaking your damn mind.

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:50.821
I speak my mind.

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:54.074
I didn't say, "Speak your mind,"
I said, "Speak your damn mind."

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:56.285
If somebody do something
you don't Iike, you say,

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:57.995
"Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:00.372
"You better get your ass together.
This is some straight up bull.

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:03.458
"Hell, what is wrong with you?
You heard me? Hell."

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.295
That's what you got
to say to them sometime.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.630
- Okay. I will.
- Think about that.

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.465
It'll make you feel better.
You'll feel so Iiberated.

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:13.510
You're around here doing all that yoda.
Honey, you ain't got to do all that yoda.

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:15.137
You ain't got to do not one more yoda.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.014
I'm gonna try that next time.

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:18.640
Good. I just gave you some great advice.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:20.058
You gave me some good advice.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.351
I'm gonna give you some better advice.

01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:22.477
White folks ain't supposed to be out here

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:24.146
on this porch
in the middle of the night, honey.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:25.230
Okay.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.357
Yep. Nope, come on,
Iet's go on in the house.

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:29.234
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you go on first.

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.405
Any luck?

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:35.699
No, none.

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:38.160
George.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:42.456
Yeah, I know what you're going to say.
You don't think I'm trying.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:45.417
Look at this charity, right here.

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.879
Okay. I don't really have to Iook at it.

01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:51.673
Hear me out.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:53.800
These guys dig wells in Africa.

01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:56.428
This one, breast cancer.

01:06:56.512 --> 01:07:00.974
This one,
they stop sex trafficking of children. Okay?

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:03.477
This one, AIDS research. This one, cancer.

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:05.604
This homeless shelter
is gonna have to close.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:08.649
George, you got to help me
help these people.

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:20.744
Brian, I'm eight years away from retiring,

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:24.164
and now I'm facing jail.

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.959
And all these people were hurt

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:30.379
because I wasn't paying attention.

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:35.050
And I was Iooking forward to retiring.

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.096
Spending time with my son.

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:44.559
Getting great, big bear hugs
after a good game of catch, you know?

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:47.354
Seeing my daughter happy,

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:50.023
content.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:55.654
I just wanted to Iive happily ever after
with my family.

01:07:56.864 --> 01:08:01.118
And now, my family's falling apart.

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:05.580
So maybe I deserve all of this, okay?

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:09.001
'Cause I can't believe
what's happening to me.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.795
How could I not see this coming?

01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:16.550
George, you couldn't see it
because you weren't paying attention.

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:18.510
But now your eyes are wide open.

01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:23.307
But none of this makes sense to me.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:27.310
I mean, I see accounts here and they all start
with a Ietter of the alphabet.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:32.441
"A," "P," "U," "J," "K," "R," "I."

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:36.153
We never use the alphabet
to start accounts, Brian.

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:39.656
I don't know what I'm Iooking at here.
I really don't.

01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:45.662
You can't just keep Ietting people
walk all over you.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:50.292
You were a mark. They set you up.
They thought you were weak.

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:53.754
They did this on purpose to you.

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:55.380
Are you just gonna Iay down
and Iet that happen,

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:56.965
or are you gonna claim your Iife back?

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:59.926
Prove them wrong.
Hit them right between the eyes.

01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:05.265
You're stronger than this.
There is a fighter in you, George.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:09.019
Show them. Show me.

01:09:09.103 --> 01:09:13.023
You can work this out, okay?
Just don't give up.

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:17.319
Shall we keep digging?

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:19.112
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:20.906
- Okay.
- AII right.

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:22.657
Watch your step.

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:27.371
Take care now.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.086
How was school?

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.004
I mean, you know, it's school.

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:37.506
School is school, yeah.

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.049
What you got there?

01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:41.009
- Baseball.
- Baseball.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:42.135
You play?

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:45.055
Yeah, but not very good.

01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:46.515
Really?

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:48.642
Well, Iet me see, son. You can't be that bad.

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:50.227
- What position do you play?
- Pitcher.

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:51.645
Okay. Well, I used to play catcher.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:53.604
So, you go on over there
and I want you to throw it to me.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:54.815
- AII right.
- I want you to throw it to me

01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:55.982
as hard as you can.

01:09:56.776 --> 01:09:58.693
- Throw it at me.
- AII right.

01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:00.320
Here we go. Put it. Put it right here.

01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:02.948
- Put it right in the middle.
- Right here, right here.

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:08.620
Yeah, you... Yeah.

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.747
- Yeah, you suck.
- Sorry, I...

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:13.667
Come here, son.

01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:16.378
That's all right, son.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:19.714
Maybe you ain't supposed to be a pitcher.
Everybody ain't supposed to be a pitcher.

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:21.842
You know, you got to get in where you fit in.

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:23.552
You know, I never thought about it that way.

01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:24.928
But Iisten, son. I'm gonna help you.

01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:28.014
I'm gonna teach you how to pitch
and to catch,

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:30.100
because we family, we family.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:32.060
- We are?
- Yeah.

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:35.689
Yeah. It's a Iong story. It's a Iong story.

01:10:35.773 --> 01:10:37.315
I used to be in the Negro League.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.610
- Negro...
- The Negro League, son.

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:44.072
Boy, somebody got to teach you
about your heritage.

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:50.787
The Negro Leagues is when
colored baseball players couldn't play...

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.623
Colored, Iike Negro, Iike me and you.

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:58.253
They couldn't play professional baseball,
so they came up with their own Ieague.

01:10:58.337 --> 01:10:59.880
Satchel Paige and I played.

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:03.800
I was a catcher,
so I'm gonna show you how to be a catcher.

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:05.218
- AII right. AII right.
- AII right?

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:07.345
Step on back there.
I'm gonna show you how to catch this.

01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:09.055
- I'm gonna throw it to you one good time.
- AII right.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.641
- I want you to concentrate real hard.
- AII right.

01:11:13.644 --> 01:11:16.313
Almost. AII right, try it.
Right here, right here.

01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:17.856
There we go. See that?

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.066
- I've had it.
- I don't care.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:21.151
Change your attitude.

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:22.652
- Hello, son.
- Hi, Mom.

01:11:22.737 --> 01:11:24.654
- Your poor father...
- My father does not need...

01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:27.991
Were you with your brother today?
AII day today, again?

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:32.037
No, Mom, I was with Brian.

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:34.331
I don't have a brother, remember?

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:36.416
This is all an act!

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:37.501
Right.

01:11:37.585 --> 01:11:38.627
I am not being disrespectful!

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:41.254
You're being so fake!
You're not my mom!

01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:42.672
- ...your attitude.
- You're making it no better.

01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:43.757
Get upstairs!

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:46.551
I want to go home. I hate it here.

01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:48.261
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:50.847
George, I can't do this anymore.

01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:52.849
- That daughter is so disrespectful.
- I know.

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:56.770
I'm gonna do all I can
to help us get our Iife back.

01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:59.022
I don't want our Iife back.

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:01.358
I want a new Iife.

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:04.528
One where you're in it.
One where we're all happy.

01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:08.406
I don't know, afternoon Iunches and sex!

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:10.242
I want sex, George!

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:12.410
Should I be Iistening to this?

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:13.745
- No!
- No!

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:18.083
Kate, I'm sorry.

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:21.753
Stop saying sorry and get mad.

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:23.922
- I am mad.
- You're not mad.

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:26.174
I'm extremely mad.

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:27.884
Extremely mad, George?

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:31.346
You don't think I'm mad?

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:32.889
I don't think you're mad.

01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:38.979
This is getting me so mad, this whole thing.

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:40.188
That's mad.

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:42.899
You're not extremely mad!
You need to get damn mad!

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:44.568
What?

01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:47.904
I'm just speaking my damn mind, okay?

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:50.907
Hell! This is some straight up bull.

01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:55.370
Hell, get your ass together. You heard me?

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:56.746
Hell!

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:04.296
I've got to get us out of here.

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:08.925
Just spill it. We gotta have it all.

01:13:09.427 --> 01:13:12.178
Because if you don't, then you're
going to jail for the rest of your Iife.

01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:17.142
Ever since we got here,
I don't care anymore.

01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:19.352
Do you know what? I don't care.
You...

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:36.953
- Hi, honey.
- Hi. What are you doing?

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:53.386
- Good one. Good one, Howie.
- Thanks.

01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:55.805
You got it.

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:18.036
Amazing Grace...

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.665
How was school today?

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:24.626
About the same
as when you were raised by Moses.

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:26.294
Where's my dad?

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:28.213
I can't stand you.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:33.843
I got something to tell you, honey.
It's awfully bad news.

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:35.887
Precious Lord...

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:37.222
What?

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.893
Your daddy died.

01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:44.979
What?

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:46.189
He died.

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:51.528
Them people that were Iooking for him,
they came here and they got him.

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:54.698
And they brought him out there
to the highway,

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:59.452
and they was painting them stripes
on the stone highway, and he tried to run,

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:02.831
and one of them stripe machine
put a Iine right down the middle of him.

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:06.209
Then the people that was coming
didn't know if it was a passing Iane

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.878
or high-occupancy vehicle Iane.

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:10.588
Everybody got confused
and they had a wreck,

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:11.881
and they just ran all over...

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:15.051
About 5,700 cars piled up on top of him.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.472
And Kate, she didn't know what to do,
so she went to running.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:23.226
She just started running as fast as she can.
Was running Iike Wonder Woman.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.855
But they had a helichopter
and that helichopter got closer...

01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:28.189
And that was it.

01:15:28.399 --> 01:15:30.024
No! Kate, too?

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:32.360
Kate, too. Kate, too.

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:34.487
And that helichopter was spinning
and them blades...

01:15:34.572 --> 01:15:37.532
Where's Howie? Where's Howie?

01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:41.161
Oh, Lord. Poor Howie.
You know, he tried to run,

01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:44.414
but he always have them candy bars
and soda pops in his pockets,

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.459
so he kept dropping things and he tripped.

01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:49.794
So they put them cement shoes on him
and they throwed him in,

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.087
and he's swimming with the fishes.

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:52.255
Oh, my God!

01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:55.884
My God! I can't believe this is happening.

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:57.927
Why you so upset?

01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.387
What do you mean?

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:03.057
Well, you always say, "I hate you. You suck.
Shut up. I hate you."

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:06.478
I didn't mean anything that I've said before.

01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:07.854
It's too Iate now, honey.

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:11.274
It's all right. They gone. Dead. Just done.

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:13.234
They gone.

01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:16.988
So, the people at Child Welfare asked me
if I would take you,

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:18.865
so I said you can stay here till you're 18,
but you...

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:21.159
No! No, no! No!

01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:23.620
I got an EBT card, what you worried about?

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:24.788
- Dad!
- Honey.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:27.457
Cindy, what's wrong?

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:29.459
She told me you died.

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:30.668
What?

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:33.838
Madea, why would you tell her that?

01:16:33.964 --> 01:16:35.256
Look, this is why I tell her that.

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:38.134
'Cause she's sitting around here mad
at everybody and being all nasty and mean.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.638
Your parents could be gone at any minute,
then you'll be stuck with somebody Iike me.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:44.057
Is that what you want?
To stay here in this hellhole?

01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:45.183
I'm sorry.

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:47.602
Start acting Iike you're sorry, then.

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:49.604
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Howie.

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:51.189
It's all right. It's all right, Cindy.

01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:54.317
Now, Iook at her, all broke up,
acting Iike she's sad and hurt.

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:58.279
Okay, honey. It's okay.

01:16:58.364 --> 01:17:01.199
Madea, that was really cruel.

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:04.452
George? Shut the hell up.

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:06.830
It worked, didn't it?

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.417
- Dad?
- Yeah, son.

01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:12.585
There's something I need to tell you.

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:16.214
It'll have to wait till Iater.
I got to start the service right now.

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:22.804
Negros.

01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:28.935
What the hell did you just say?

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:31.312
- Negros.
- Barbara!

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:32.605
Mom,

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:38.027
why don't we step out onto the porch
and get some air?

01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:40.071
- Negros.
- Grams.

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:43.074
I hear Negros from my room.

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:46.536
I believe they're called
African-Americans now, Grandma.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.621
Did that child just say "they"?

01:17:48.706 --> 01:17:50.415
No, "we."

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:54.127
So beautiful. I hear them from my room.

01:17:54.211 --> 01:17:55.420
- Okay.
- What's going on?

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:59.048
My baby mama just went Ieft, Mabel.
She just went Ieft.

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:00.258
Went Ieft?

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:01.801
I hear...

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:06.806
I hear them from my room.
I hear Negros from my room.

01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:10.226
Well, I see dead people,
but I keep that to myself.

01:18:10.561 --> 01:18:11.936
Tell them, Sadie.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:13.396
Who the hell is Sadie?

01:18:14.064 --> 01:18:15.315
Shut up.

01:18:15.816 --> 01:18:18.693
Madea, honey. She right, she hear Negros.

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:24.073
It's bad enough that she's slipping.

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:25.742
Please don't encourage her.

01:18:25.826 --> 01:18:28.578
No, she do hear Negros.

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:30.121
The whole bunch of them.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:33.750
She hears a bunch of Negros?

01:18:35.502 --> 01:18:37.545
Yes, everybody Iisten. Everybody be quiet.

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:41.382
Spirituals.

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:44.177
That's it. That's what she's trying to say,
Negro spirituals.

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:46.471
There's a church down on the corner.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:48.973
They sing Negro spirituals on Sundays.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.975
Why y'all so uptight?

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:55.939
Son, will you take me to the Negros?

01:18:56.023 --> 01:18:58.358
- Take you to the Negro spiritual, honey.
- Spiritual.

01:18:58.442 --> 01:19:00.902
Right. You can't just say "Negros."
Them days has passed.

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:02.904
First we were "Negros,"
then we was "colored,"

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:05.490
then we were "black,"
now we "African-American."

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:08.701
Okay? African-Americans.
Now singing old Negro spirituals.

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:09.953
- Spirituals.
- Negro spirituals.

01:19:10.037 --> 01:19:13.373
- Spirituals. Spirituals. Okay.
- Yes, Mom. Yes, yes.

01:19:13.457 --> 01:19:14.791
Yes, Iet's go.

01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:18.586
Let's go down to the church.

01:19:18.671 --> 01:19:19.712
Is it safe?

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:21.297
What you mean, "Is it safe," George?

01:19:21.382 --> 01:19:24.050
What they gonna do,
stone you with a Bible? It's a church.

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:11.222
Pretty good.

01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:24.819
Can I get an "amen" for our choir?

01:20:24.903 --> 01:20:26.237
Amen!

01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:27.780
AII right, well done.

01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:29.741
Well done.

01:20:31.035 --> 01:20:32.035
Praise the Lord.

01:20:32.119 --> 01:20:33.953
Praise the Lord!

01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:40.960
Praise the Lord. I am so happy, so happy
to be back in the House of the Lord

01:20:42.463 --> 01:20:44.714
where mercy can be found.

01:20:45.716 --> 01:20:50.178
As most of you know, I have
been very sick these past few months.

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:53.765
But by the grace of God, I've recovered.
But I have to tell you something.

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:59.562
I've given a Iot of prayer
and I feel it's time for me to retire.

01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:03.149
Now don't y'all worry, don't worry.

01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:06.486
This church will continue,
and its future's guaranteed,

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:09.405
because the church has been paid off.

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:16.621
Praise God!

01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:17.997
Oh, no.

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:26.839
And I was able to pay the church off
because of the investments of my son.

01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:28.966
My son.

01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:31.344
I'm so proud of him.

01:21:31.428 --> 01:21:34.305
Son, come on up here
and tell them what you've done.

01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:37.934
Let us praise Jesus
'cause we're all precious in His name.

01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:39.435
Precious.

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:43.106
Precious?

01:21:44.108 --> 01:21:45.441
- To all the congregation here...
- Precious.

01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:48.861
...there's something I need to tell you.

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:50.696
I did invest the money...

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:54.826
Precious!

01:21:54.952 --> 01:21:56.369
Somebody's got the Holy Ghost.

01:21:57.454 --> 01:22:01.541
I know!

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:04.961
- You know?
- I know!

01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:07.004
The same know that I know?

01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:08.589
I know!

01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:09.757
That man knows!

01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:11.676
- You know?
- I know!

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:15.012
- How much do you know?
- Do you think that he knows now?

01:22:15.139 --> 01:22:16.973
- I'm not hot, I just know.
- Praise the Lord!

01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:18.307
Yes!

01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:20.184
AII right, George, you want to try
to explain this to me?

01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:21.394
Yeah.

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:23.563
There was a woman
named Precious Jackson

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:25.565
that Walter always told me about. Okay?

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:28.526
Now I've Iooked at these accounts
and they all start with a Ietter.

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:31.320
The Ietters spell out "Precious Jackson."

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:34.240
It's all encrypted, right here.

01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:36.659
What the hell are you talking about?

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:38.828
The Ietters spell out...

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:40.454
Okay, I'm a Iittle confused
by this, too.

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.832
It's the name the account is in.

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:44.458
Okay.

01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:47.753
Just follow this, 'cause it took some doing

01:22:47.838 --> 01:22:50.673
to follow the money trail
from the Cayman Islands and Germany.

01:22:50.757 --> 01:22:56.220
But the trail goes cold when the money
goes into a Swiss account. Okay?

01:22:56.346 --> 01:23:00.183
Now, they were all given a Ietter
when they went in and came out.

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:02.059
- Right?
- Okay.

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:05.938
But every month on this date,

01:23:06.023 --> 01:23:09.400
as the funds go into this Swiss account,

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:12.486
this account in the US sees a deposit.

01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:16.324
Now I balance the two, and it's exactly 10 %

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:20.328
that resurfaces in the US
in this account every month

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:23.080
to a Iady named Precious Jackson.

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.458
What is 10 % gonna do?

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:28.085
Of 600 million?

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:30.796
That's six million!

01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:32.006
Jake.

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.886
It's 60 million.

01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:38.721
- Sixty.
- Sixty.

01:23:38.805 --> 01:23:40.806
George.

01:23:40.891 --> 01:23:42.475
I can get the church's money back.

01:23:42.893 --> 01:23:45.686
- Praise God.
- Yes, you and all the charities.

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.855
- Can this really work?
- Yes, it can work.

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:49.315
Why would Walter take this money

01:23:49.399 --> 01:23:52.235
and put it in an account with
some woman's name who never touches it?

01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:56.614
Well, either he didn't tell her about it,
or she doesn't exist.

01:23:56.698 --> 01:24:00.117
So what I'll do is I'll get a federal warrant,

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:01.744
we'll get the account seized.

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:04.789
I'm pretty sure once I bring this to the judge,
you'll be able to get probation.

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:05.915
That's a great job.

01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:09.210
But, Brian, we can get this money
back to the people it belongs to.

01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:11.295
It's sitting right here in this account.

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.589
You didn't just say that to me.
I'm an officer of the court.

01:24:13.674 --> 01:24:15.675
I don't even know what you're thinking.
I didn't hear that.

01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:18.177
I don't even want to know
what you're thinking. No. No, no, no.

01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:19.762
- Brian.
- Not having this conversation.

01:24:19.846 --> 01:24:21.264
- I'm out of here.
- Please. Come on.

01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:22.974
- I will see you at the office tomorrow...
- Brian.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:24.058
...bright and early, George.

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:25.434
- Thank you so much.
- Brian. Please.

01:24:25.519 --> 01:24:26.560
Bye.

01:24:28.438 --> 01:24:31.107
I've come too close to give up now, okay?
I'm not calling it quits.

01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:33.859
I'm gonna get that money
back to the charities.

01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:36.988
Right? I want my Iife back.

01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:40.408
And here is where I start to take action.

01:24:40.492 --> 01:24:44.662
So you're either with me or you're not,
but I'm not giving up without a fight.

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:48.749
So what's it gonna be,
Mr. I'm-a-tough-guy-from-the-hood?

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:51.752
Mr. You-going-down-homie?

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:55.089
'Cause I'll tell you,
I'm gonna do the damn thing.

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:56.966
So you're with me or what?

01:24:57.968 --> 01:24:59.093
I'm with you.

01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:01.304
- Gucci!
- Yeah.

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:04.307
With you.

01:25:10.147 --> 01:25:11.397
You okay?

01:25:12.482 --> 01:25:13.566
I will be.

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:16.527
George, what's going on?

01:25:16.653 --> 01:25:19.238
I screwed up, that's what's going on.

01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:21.866
And now there's a big wrong
that I have to right.

01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:26.245
And I just have to figure out
how I'm gonna do it.

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:28.664
But I'm gonna do it. I am gonna do it.

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:32.918
George, I haven't seen this much fire in you
since we got married.

01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:35.671
Well, maybe it's Iong overdue, huh?

01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:40.176
Do you remember
our honeymoon in Florence?

01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:44.180
- I remember it rained every day.
- It did.

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:46.015
And do you remember, you said,

01:25:46.099 --> 01:25:49.185
"What if our marriage is
nothing but full of rainy days?"

01:25:49.269 --> 01:25:51.354
I might have been joking.

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:54.273
But I remember
you still got upset, didn't you?

01:25:54.358 --> 01:25:55.941
- I did.
- Yeah.

01:25:56.026 --> 01:25:57.234
And what did you say?

01:25:57.944 --> 01:25:59.862
I said,

01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:03.240
"Rain does make things grow."

01:26:03.367 --> 01:26:05.117
Exactly.

01:26:05.202 --> 01:26:08.329
What if all this happened for a reason?

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.373
For you and I
to get to know each other again,

01:26:10.457 --> 01:26:13.793
for our family to get closer, for us to grow?

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:16.796
What if it did?

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:20.633
Kate, you are amazing.

01:26:21.885 --> 01:26:24.136
I swear to you, I'm gonna make things right.

01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:26.847
I have no doubt.

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:29.016
Honey, you always do the right thing.

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:30.726
I Iove you so much.

01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:32.561
I Iove you, too.

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:36.107
I'm so proud of you, George.

01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:39.443
That's good.

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:41.070
I'm closing an account.

01:26:41.321 --> 01:26:46.075
Rita, it looks like you'll be
withdrawing $4 million from us today.

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:47.243
$4 million?

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:49.286
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:51.664
Well, how would you like that?

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:53.499
10s and 20s?

01:26:53.917 --> 01:26:56.627
Hey, son. We watching Ghost.

01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:59.255
She's gonna walk up in a bank
and act Iike she somebody else.

01:26:59.339 --> 01:27:00.548
Look at that.

01:27:00.632 --> 01:27:03.342
You know we require identification
and all that.

01:27:03.427 --> 01:27:06.804
Rita Miller or Oda Mae Jones,
she don't even know what her name is.

01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:10.808
Rita Miller. That's my name.

01:27:11.268 --> 01:27:13.018
My name. Rita Miller.

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:16.897
My name.

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:19.692
The check.

01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:22.403
Here you are.

01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:27.992
What the hell you Iooking at me
Iike the Iast virgin for?

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:34.832
Now Iet me make sure I got this right.

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:37.334
Y'all want me to get on the aeroplane,

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:40.796
go out to New York City and go in a bank
and pretend to be Precious Jackson?

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:43.340
Is that right?

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:44.508
Yes.

01:27:47.637 --> 01:27:49.513
Does Brian know anything about this?

01:27:49.598 --> 01:27:52.099
- No.
- He thinks you both could go to jail.

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:54.268
Well, I could be going to jail anyway.

01:27:54.352 --> 01:27:56.645
That's all right. Just don't drop the soap,
you'll be fine.

01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:59.440
I been up in there. You might have to
fight a Iittle bit, kick a Iittle ass.

01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:00.608
But you'll be all right.

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:02.693
If you don't kick no ass,
they gonna take your ass.

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:04.153
But you'll be all right.

01:28:05.238 --> 01:28:07.114
I don't know about this, though.
I don't feel good about this.

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:08.908
I just don't... I don't know. I don't know.

01:28:08.992 --> 01:28:11.076
Madea, it's easy.

01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:13.829
It's just as easy as it was in the movie.

01:28:14.664 --> 01:28:16.499
Whoopi Goldberg had a dead white man
helping her

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:18.125
all through that whole movie.

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:19.460
I'll help you.

01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:21.670
You alive. I said dead!

01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:23.047
George, you cannot go to New York.

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.215
Honey, I have to.

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:26.425
You can't. They're still after you.
Are you crazy?

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:28.302
I'll disguise myself somehow.

01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:30.346
They won't know me. Okay? It'll be fine.

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:32.139
- No, I can't do that.
- Madea.

01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:34.266
Please, I know you can do it.

01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:36.393
You say this is for charity?

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.896
And for the church? Right, Jake?
For the church? It's for the church?

01:28:39.022 --> 01:28:41.524
It's for the church, for your daddy
get the money back for the church?

01:28:41.608 --> 01:28:44.568
AII right. Now my question then becomes,

01:28:44.694 --> 01:28:47.655
all these beautiful people
that got these charities

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:50.699
and helping all these children
and feeding the people around the world,

01:28:50.784 --> 01:28:53.911
it's for that, that's wonderful,
but I have a question for you.

01:28:55.872 --> 01:28:57.957
What the hell in it for me?

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:02.044
Madea, you'll feel a Iot better about yourself.

01:29:02.879 --> 01:29:06.382
I always feel good about myself.
Hell, I was born 6'2".

01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:08.425
237 pounds.

01:29:08.552 --> 01:29:12.137
I have always been this big all my Iife.
I went to kindergarten this big.

01:29:12.305 --> 01:29:14.598
I had to have high self-esteem.
I feel good about myself.

01:29:14.724 --> 01:29:16.934
Ain't nothing you gonna tell me
gonna make me feel good about myself.

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:18.978
You give me some money,
that'll make me feel good about myself.

01:29:20.063 --> 01:29:21.355
Okay, you know what?

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:24.400
Can we figure that out after this is done?

01:29:25.235 --> 01:29:27.403
George, have you ever hired a ho?

01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:32.241
No. No.

01:29:33.326 --> 01:29:35.369
She want her money first.
Do you understand?

01:29:35.453 --> 01:29:36.787
I need to get some money first.

01:29:36.913 --> 01:29:40.124
Don't perform no services
until the money's on the table.

01:29:42.752 --> 01:29:45.838
You know what? I'll do it. I will do it.

01:29:45.922 --> 01:29:47.381
AII I got to do is go in there

01:29:47.465 --> 01:29:49.592
and give them a bunch of accounts
to transfer the money to?

01:29:49.676 --> 01:29:50.926
- Yes.
- 12 accounts?

01:29:51.011 --> 01:29:52.386
I just give them the information
to do the transfer?

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:53.721
That's it. That's all.

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:54.888
AII right, I'll do it.

01:29:54.973 --> 01:29:58.267
Then I will gladly do it. So he just
gonna wire the money to the accounts?

01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:00.644
- Yes.
- Okay, fine.

01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:02.938
Come on, Iet's go. Where's my purse?
Y'all get my purse.

01:30:03.023 --> 01:30:05.149
Joe, where's my purse?
We've got to go up to New York.

01:30:05.275 --> 01:30:07.234
You know what? If you guys are gonna go,

01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:09.403
she can't Iook Iike this,
she can't be wearing that.

01:30:09.487 --> 01:30:10.946
- Right.
- What's wrong with what I got on?

01:30:12.282 --> 01:30:15.576
This came from Aretha Franklin.
Aretha gave me this.

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.328
And y'all know Aretha can dress.

01:30:17.454 --> 01:30:20.039
You've seen Aretha,
she makes fashion statements.

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:22.625
How about Barbara, Cindy and I
give you a makeover?

01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:27.838
Introducing Precious Jackson.

01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:49.151
Wow.

01:30:51.196 --> 01:30:52.321
This might work.

01:30:52.656 --> 01:30:55.949
No. I don't know what the hell
y'all are thinking.

01:30:56.034 --> 01:30:58.661
You Iook Iike a big ass bottle
of Pepto-Bismol.

01:31:16.221 --> 01:31:18.681
- Can I give you a hand, sir?
- Yes. The Iuggage.

01:31:18.765 --> 01:31:20.182
The airport.

01:31:20.266 --> 01:31:22.393
This bag. This way.

01:31:22.519 --> 01:31:24.019
- Here we go?
- Yeah.

01:31:24.104 --> 01:31:25.354
Okay.

01:31:26.356 --> 01:31:27.523
Going to the airport.

01:31:27.607 --> 01:31:29.441
- Right this way, ma'am.
- AII right, I'll follow you.

01:31:29.526 --> 01:31:32.027
You ain't got to rush me,
I know where the hell I'm going.

01:31:33.571 --> 01:31:35.197
The airport. A Iot of people here.

01:31:35.699 --> 01:31:37.116
I'm nervous. I need to relax.

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.659
Well, there's nothing to be nervous about.

01:31:38.743 --> 01:31:42.121
It's just Iike riding in a car,
except you're 30,000 feet higher.

01:31:42.205 --> 01:31:44.832
Cars don't crash from 30,000 feet, George.

01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:48.335
You need something to calm your nerves,
I got that old wee-wee.

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:50.045
Hey, what does that mean, drugs?

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:51.380
- Is that drugs?
- I know you ain't got no drugs.

01:31:51.464 --> 01:31:52.548
- No drugs.
- If you got...

01:31:52.632 --> 01:31:53.966
I'm gonna beat your ass
if you got them drugs.

01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:55.134
You don't bring no drugs up in here.

01:31:55.218 --> 01:31:57.052
- They got sniffing dogs up in here.
- No drugs.

01:31:57.137 --> 01:31:59.638
Y'all go through.
I'm not going through with y'all.

01:31:59.723 --> 01:32:01.974
I'm not going through.
Excuse me, y'all. Excuse me.

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:04.643
- I'm not going through with them at all.
- Madame, you are making a scene.

01:32:04.728 --> 01:32:07.312
- Watch yourself. Watch yourself, here.
- That's a no, no.

01:32:07.897 --> 01:32:11.900
Y'all go on.
I don't know them. I don't know them.

01:32:12.402 --> 01:32:14.403
Hi. Hi. A Iittle scary.

01:32:14.738 --> 01:32:17.072
When I'm finished doing,
this gonna be the bomb.

01:32:17.407 --> 01:32:19.908
- Don't say "bomb." Don't say "bomb."
- What is the bomb?

01:32:19.993 --> 01:32:22.244
- No, no, no.
- Don't say...

01:32:22.328 --> 01:32:24.163
Hey, he don't want me saying "bomb."

01:32:24.247 --> 01:32:25.414
Okay.

01:32:27.459 --> 01:32:30.043
What do I do, just give him the ticket?

01:32:30.128 --> 01:32:31.670
And show him my ID?

01:32:31.755 --> 01:32:33.881
- Okay.
- That's the way.

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:35.966
Okay, that's me, and that's my ticket.

01:32:36.092 --> 01:32:38.719
- That is the way.
- Okay, thank you so much.

01:32:38.803 --> 01:32:40.637
AII right.

01:32:40.764 --> 01:32:43.015
Now what y'all doing?

01:32:43.099 --> 01:32:45.392
- What y'all doing?
- Taking off our shoes.

01:32:45.477 --> 01:32:48.395
Take off your personal items
and put them in the tray.

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:51.064
What they gonna do
with my personal items?

01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:52.316
Baby, I can't take off my shoe.

01:32:52.442 --> 01:32:54.651
Do you know how hard it is for
a woman my size to take off her shoes?

01:32:54.778 --> 01:32:56.111
I'm supposed to take off my shoes?

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:57.404
Yes, ma'am.

01:32:58.114 --> 01:33:00.908
What the hell do I need
to be taking my shoes off for?

01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:04.369
Baby, when you're this big,
it's hard to take your shoes off.

01:33:04.454 --> 01:33:05.454
That's all I'm saying.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:08.582
Take them off, but I don't know who the hell
gonna help me put them back on.

01:33:08.666 --> 01:33:10.793
Y'all so serious.

01:33:15.173 --> 01:33:16.799
Watch that now.

01:33:21.012 --> 01:33:22.095
There you go.

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:24.807
Oh, Lord. And you just
push it through there?

01:33:25.141 --> 01:33:27.267
- Now what I do? What I do?
- Right this way.

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:28.560
Right this way.

01:33:28.645 --> 01:33:31.104
Okay. I'm gonna come on
through this thing.

01:33:33.942 --> 01:33:36.151
- What the hell is that?
- Just step over here, please, ma'am.

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:37.444
What was that?

01:33:37.529 --> 01:33:38.862
Just step over here through the scanner.

01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:41.365
- What'd you want me to do?
- Step through here, please.

01:33:41.491 --> 01:33:44.159
- Okay, all right.
- Right through the scanner.

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:46.370
Now what am I supposed to do?
This ain't gonna drop me down?

01:33:46.496 --> 01:33:48.539
Just go and put your feet
in the footsteps, please.

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:52.167
That's really wide. You want me to put
both my feet where these yellow feet?

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:53.502
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's really wide.

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:56.004
My Iegs ain't been open that wide
since I had my daughter.

01:33:57.674 --> 01:34:00.300
George, they want me to spread my Iegs.

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:01.927
Okay, fine.

01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:04.221
- Now what?
- Put your hands over your head, please.

01:34:04.347 --> 01:34:05.472
- Like this?
- That's it.

01:34:05.557 --> 01:34:08.016
Hands over your head.

01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:10.435
Wow, this is really sexual.

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:13.105
Reminds me back of my stripping days.

01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:15.524
They used to call me Magnitude.

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:18.694
You see anything?

01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:22.030
Can I have you step outside, please?

01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:23.490
Step outside.

01:34:23.575 --> 01:34:24.658
Right this way. Put your hands down.

01:34:24.742 --> 01:34:26.493
- Can I close my Iegs?
- Yes, please.

01:34:26.578 --> 01:34:28.537
Okay, thank you so much.

01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:30.956
- Now what?
- Stand right over here, please.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.125
- Yes.
- I'm just gonna do a quick pat down.

01:34:33.209 --> 01:34:34.918
- On my body?
- Yes.

01:34:35.044 --> 01:34:36.670
- Go ahead and raise your hands.
- Am I under arrest?

01:34:36.754 --> 01:34:38.171
- No, ma'am.
- Why you patting me down?

01:34:38.256 --> 01:34:40.132
- Just standard procedure.
- A standard...

01:34:40.216 --> 01:34:42.301
- I got to do all this to get on the airplane?
- Yes, please.

01:34:42.385 --> 01:34:44.553
George, I got to do all this
to get on the airplane?

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:47.681
Ma'am, it's just standard procedure.
I need you to put your hands up, please.

01:34:47.765 --> 01:34:50.350
- Thank you.
- Go on, pat me down.

01:34:50.435 --> 01:34:51.560
Now, wait a minute.

01:34:52.061 --> 01:34:54.813
You gonna find a roadmap to heaven.
You better come on from up there now.

01:34:54.898 --> 01:34:56.273
Come on up.

01:34:57.275 --> 01:34:58.567
Turn around.

01:34:58.693 --> 01:34:59.902
Can I put my hands down?

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:02.696
Now wait. Now what the hell you doing?

01:35:03.072 --> 01:35:04.406
Boy.

01:35:05.408 --> 01:35:07.701
Something back here
that you wanna tell me about?

01:35:07.785 --> 01:35:11.371
Yes, that's my ass.
It's from wall-to-wall in this skirt.

01:35:12.749 --> 01:35:15.542
We're clear. Go right ahead.

01:35:15.627 --> 01:35:19.338
You need to buy me a cigarette or a drink
or something after doing all that to me.

01:35:19.422 --> 01:35:20.464
You don't know me.

01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:22.174
I ain't felt that many hands
all over my body

01:35:22.258 --> 01:35:23.634
since I got off that train from Mexico.

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.260
Where's my purse and my shoes?

01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:33.852
Anybody ever told you
you Iook Iike Beyoncé?

01:35:33.937 --> 01:35:34.937
No.

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:37.439
Madea, I found my wifey.

01:35:40.068 --> 01:35:41.526
Shut the hell up back there. You in coach.

01:35:41.611 --> 01:35:43.612
You ain't supposed to talk
to nobody in first class.

01:35:43.738 --> 01:35:46.198
Didn't you see Titanic?

01:35:46.282 --> 01:35:47.658
I'm nervous.

01:35:47.784 --> 01:35:49.618
I know. But behave.

01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:52.496
What the hell was that? What was that?

01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:55.958
There better not be no terrorer on this plane.
Is there a terrorer?

01:35:56.292 --> 01:35:59.127
Is there terrorer on here?
Better not be no terrorer.

01:35:59.796 --> 01:36:01.797
Madea, it's a bump. Bump, bump.

01:36:01.923 --> 01:36:03.715
What the hell a bump doing in the air?
Bumps are on the road.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.717
- That's all.
- Bumps ain't in the air. Hell.

01:36:05.802 --> 01:36:08.303
This thing just makes me nervous.
I don't Iike being on this thing.

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:12.224
I got to pee. I need something to relax me.
Calm me down.

01:36:12.308 --> 01:36:13.600
What do you want? What do you want?

01:36:13.685 --> 01:36:16.144
I want a joint.

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:19.523
- You need that good-good, Madea?
- Boy, shut up.

01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:21.650
Just get me a drink. Can I get a drink?

01:36:21.776 --> 01:36:24.027
Can they get a Iady a drink?
Can a colored woman get a drink?

01:36:24.153 --> 01:36:25.487
I'll get a flight attendant.

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:28.281
I'll get her. Flight attendant?

01:36:28.366 --> 01:36:32.160
Flight attendant? Flight attendant?
Flight attendant?

01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:34.121
Ma'am, are you okay?

01:36:34.205 --> 01:36:37.332
You're making the other passengers
just a Iittle bit nervous, okay?

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:38.542
I would Iike something to drink, please.

01:36:38.668 --> 01:36:40.502
'Cause I need something
to relax me just a Iittle bit.

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:41.670
Okay. What would you Iike?

01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:43.213
That depends. How much is it?

01:36:43.339 --> 01:36:44.756
You're in first class, it's free.

01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:46.758
Okay. Well, bring me every damn thing
you got back there.

01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:47.884
If it's brown, pour it.

01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:11.366
Lord have mercy, I ain't never
seen no place Iike this before.

01:37:12.076 --> 01:37:14.578
They call it the Big Apple, huh?

01:37:15.038 --> 01:37:18.331
I wonder why they call it the Big Apple.
I don't see no apples.

01:37:18.416 --> 01:37:20.500
- Do you see the apples anywhere?
- No.

01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:27.174
I wanna see that thing, too,
that thing with the torch on it.

01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:30.302
The statue. The Statue of Limitations.

01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:32.471
Lord, Iook at all these people.

01:37:32.555 --> 01:37:34.389
I ain't never seen this many
people in one place

01:37:34.474 --> 01:37:36.016
unless they be giving away
government cheese.

01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:39.603
I don't understand why folk would be
all on top of each other Iike this.

01:37:39.937 --> 01:37:42.105
This is too much.
I got to get back to Georgia.

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:43.982
Come on,
Iet's go get this business done.

01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:55.077
New York!

01:37:55.161 --> 01:37:56.995
Yes indeed, y'all. This is nice.

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.206
- Yeah, I'm in New York, baby.
- How you doing?

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:01.083
Hello, madame. May I take your bags?

01:38:01.167 --> 01:38:03.251
- Where you gonna take it?
- I'll take it to your room, if you Iike.

01:38:03.336 --> 01:38:06.922
- No. No. No, no.
- She is world-traveled.

01:38:07.006 --> 01:38:10.592
She never think about the Iuggage.

01:38:10.676 --> 01:38:11.843
I don't think about no Iuggage.

01:38:11.928 --> 01:38:15.180
I don't think about no Iuggage
or the garbage or none of that stuff.

01:38:15.264 --> 01:38:16.515
- This way.
- Okay.

01:38:16.599 --> 01:38:19.017
Well, get on out of the way there.
Let a Iady pass.

01:38:19.102 --> 01:38:22.354
You in the way, George, move.
Let them open the door for me.

01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:28.235
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:32.531
This place is Iovely. Hello.
Welcome. Thank you. Welcome.

01:38:32.615 --> 01:38:34.950
Welcome to me. My first time here.

01:38:35.034 --> 01:38:36.868
Hello. Hello.

01:38:36.953 --> 01:38:40.997
They take dogs. Well, Oprah Winfrey
must stay here. Is she here?

01:38:41.082 --> 01:38:42.582
This is Iovely.

01:38:42.667 --> 01:38:45.377
Run into me one more time,
and I'm gonna knock the hell out of you.

01:38:45.461 --> 01:38:47.963
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:38:48.047 --> 01:38:49.798
Good afternoon, sir.

01:38:49.882 --> 01:38:52.801

That is my name.
I'm one of the Jackson family.

01:39:17.493 --> 01:39:19.995
- Well, really? That's wonderful, madam.
- Yes, yes.

01:39:20.079 --> 01:39:21.413

Excuse me. Excuse me.

Back the hell up. Thank you.

01:39:34.427 --> 01:39:39.181
If I have a phone call from Janet or La Toya
or Rebbie Jackson...

01:39:39.265 --> 01:39:40.974
- Yes, madam?
- ...please put them through.

01:39:41.058 --> 01:39:43.393
- They're always calling me, all the time.
- I see.

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:45.395
'Cause they need makeup tips and advice.

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:47.105

- Yes, thanks.

01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:48.899
- I will do that, madam. Yes.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:39:48.983 --> 01:39:52.110
- Shall we go?
- The elevators are to your Ieft.

01:39:52.195 --> 01:39:54.070
And I do hope you enjoy your stay.

01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:55.864
- Well, yes, we will. Thank you so much.
- Yes, wonderful.

01:39:55.948 --> 01:39:57.782
- Thank you so much.
- Don't fall over.

01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:01.995
You hit me with these bags one more time,
I will knock the hell out of you.

01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:03.997
- What's in here?
- Get the hell on the elevator.

01:40:04.081 --> 01:40:05.498
You got two midgets in here.

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:12.088
If Randy or Jermaine or Tito call,

01:40:12.173 --> 01:40:16.092
tell them I just cannot talk right now,
I'm gonna have to call them Iater.

01:40:16.177 --> 01:40:17.344
Very good, madam. I have that.

01:40:17.428 --> 01:40:18.970
What the hell you
pulling me for, George?

01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:25.936
I know how to open the door, here. This...

01:40:26.479 --> 01:40:28.146
This is nice.

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:32.067
Oh, Lord, this furniture nice.

01:40:32.151 --> 01:40:34.277
Ain't got no plastic on it.
Can't be too nice, though.

01:40:34.612 --> 01:40:36.029
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:40:36.113 --> 01:40:38.490
- Wonderful. Hello.
- Hello.

01:40:39.158 --> 01:40:40.909
Your chocolate.

01:40:40.993 --> 01:40:42.994
Yes, I know I'm chocolate.

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:47.832
That's a new way of saying "black"?
I'm chocolate, yes. African-American.

01:40:48.334 --> 01:40:53.338
Forgive madame.
She is, how you say, preoccupée.

01:40:53.798 --> 01:40:57.050
You gonna stop calling me madame.
My name is Madea, not madame.

01:40:57.551 --> 01:40:58.885
Zip it.

01:40:59.762 --> 01:41:02.514
- For you, monsieur. Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:41:04.058 --> 01:41:05.308
What the hell was he just
standing up here for,

01:41:05.393 --> 01:41:07.018
just Iooking all scary and weird?

01:41:07.103 --> 01:41:08.353
I thought I had
checked into the Bates Motel.

01:41:08.437 --> 01:41:09.437
He's standing there Iike that.

01:41:09.772 --> 01:41:12.148
- What was he waiting for?
- A gratuity.

01:41:12.858 --> 01:41:15.026
- What is that?
- A tip.

01:41:15.111 --> 01:41:17.195
Why didn't you just say "tip"?
I know what the hell a tip is.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:20.407
Now, George, how much did you just
give that man? You gave him paper money.

01:41:20.491 --> 01:41:22.409
- How much was that?
- Twenty.

01:41:23.577 --> 01:41:24.953
Twenty what?

01:41:25.037 --> 01:41:26.579
Dollars. $20.

01:41:27.623 --> 01:41:29.374
Have you Iost your mind, George?

01:41:29.458 --> 01:41:31.918
Waiter! Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

01:41:32.003 --> 01:41:35.755
Hello, mister. Can I talk to you
forjust a second?

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:38.091
Mister? I'm tired as hell.

01:41:38.175 --> 01:41:41.177
Here. Hold this for me, baby,
and Iet me hold that. That's $20.

01:41:41.262 --> 01:41:44.431
Baby, Iisten, if we wanted that for chocolate,
we'd go get us a Snickers.

01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:45.557
Here's your tip.

01:41:45.641 --> 01:41:47.559
Pardon, monsieur, she is...

01:41:49.395 --> 01:41:52.647
- Movez-vous. Movez-vous.
- Go on. Go on. $20?

01:41:52.732 --> 01:41:56.318
Would you get a grip?
You've got to play the part.

01:41:56.402 --> 01:41:58.653
Trust me. Appearance is everything. Okay?

01:41:58.738 --> 01:41:59.946
Now, we need to get some rest

01:42:00.031 --> 01:42:03.033
so we can get to the bank early
and get out of here.

01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:04.784
That's fine.
Let's get some rest, then, George.

01:42:04.869 --> 01:42:07.287
But you ain't gonna give no $20 to nobody.
That's just damn crazy.

01:42:07.371 --> 01:42:09.664
Child, if Joe could see me now.

01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:13.960
This mattress is nice.

01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:17.547
No, can't Iay down flat Iike that.

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:22.177
Yeah. Women who is well-endowed
can't Iay flat.

01:42:23.262 --> 01:42:24.929
'Cause them breasts will
sneak up around your neck

01:42:25.014 --> 01:42:27.307
and choke the hell out of you
through the night.

01:42:27.391 --> 01:42:29.976
Got to throw them over to the side.

01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:32.604
This is nice.

01:42:34.315 --> 01:42:36.274
Silk.

01:42:39.278 --> 01:42:41.071
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

01:42:41.155 --> 01:42:42.822
Now remember, you're Precious Jackson,

01:42:42.907 --> 01:42:45.867
and you wanna get all the money
transferred into the 12 accounts.

01:42:45.951 --> 01:42:47.452
You can't keep running this
over and over again.

01:42:47.536 --> 01:42:49.913
- You're gonna make me forget everything.
- Okay. This is it. This is it.

01:42:49.997 --> 01:42:51.664
I understand.
You gonna make me forget everything.

01:42:51.749 --> 01:42:53.124
I can't keep doing this over and over again.

01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:55.210
- Just relax.
- AII right, I got it.

01:42:55.294 --> 01:42:59.339
I'm relaxed, George, I'm relaxed.
But you tensing me the hell up.

01:42:59.423 --> 01:43:01.424
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

01:43:01.509 --> 01:43:03.635
- Got it?
- I got it. I got it.

01:43:08.974 --> 01:43:10.016
Madea.

01:43:11.894 --> 01:43:12.894
Yes?

01:43:13.854 --> 01:43:19.317
Remember, the man you're meeting,
his name is Jack Goldenberg.

01:43:20.444 --> 01:43:22.695
What the hell you speaking
a French accent for, George?

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:23.905
This is me and you talking.

01:43:23.989 --> 01:43:25.448
Hell, I know how to speak French, too.

01:43:27.618 --> 01:43:28.701
Shut the hell up.

01:43:28.786 --> 01:43:32.539
I got it. Jack Goldenberg.

01:43:32.623 --> 01:43:34.290
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:43:36.585 --> 01:43:39.045
Excuse me while I do my Tyra Banks.

01:43:53.978 --> 01:43:55.186
Hello.

01:43:57.523 --> 01:44:01.192
Can you help me?
I'm here to see Whoopi Goldberg.

01:44:02.361 --> 01:44:03.695
Excuse me?

01:44:05.948 --> 01:44:09.367
Silly me. I'm sorry.
I was just watching The View.

01:44:09.452 --> 01:44:15.248
I'm here to see Jack Goldenberg.
Jack Goldenberg.

01:44:15.332 --> 01:44:17.625
- May I tell him who's here?
- Yes...

01:44:18.794 --> 01:44:21.671
I'm sorry, I was about to say,
"What a mighty God we serve."

01:44:23.299 --> 01:44:27.051
Precious Jackson is my name.
I'm a part of the Jackson family.

01:44:27.136 --> 01:44:29.554
Yes. But, you know,
they put me on the outskirts.

01:44:29.638 --> 01:44:32.182
- So now, it's just me and Bubbles.
- Bubbles.

01:44:32.308 --> 01:44:33.558
- Yeah, yeah.
- That the monkey?

01:44:33.642 --> 01:44:35.101
- Yeah, great Iittle monkey.
- Oh, my God.

01:44:35.186 --> 01:44:38.980
Yeah. I call him Joe,
but everybody else calls him Bubbles.

01:44:40.316 --> 01:44:41.691
You certainly do have an appointment.

01:44:42.735 --> 01:44:45.153
Precious Jackson to see you.

01:44:45.237 --> 01:44:48.072
Hello. Hi. Thank you so much, Magdalene.

01:44:48.157 --> 01:44:49.741
- It's so great to see you.
- How can I help you?

01:44:49.825 --> 01:44:53.453
Jack, I called you.

01:44:53.537 --> 01:44:57.040
We spoke about all the transfers
that I need to do.

01:44:57.166 --> 01:45:01.169
I got that request Iast evening. Let me see.

01:45:01.253 --> 01:45:04.631
Jack, can we do this? I'd Iike
to add one more account to that.

01:45:04.715 --> 01:45:07.717
Because I'm feeling so generous
and I've given to so many charities.

01:45:07.843 --> 01:45:11.054
Here is the account number.
I know that's 12, this'll be the 13th.

01:45:11.347 --> 01:45:13.264
- Thirteenth?
- Yes.

01:45:13.349 --> 01:45:16.935
And, of course, in this economic climate,
you're gonna need my identification.

01:45:17.019 --> 01:45:18.478
Precious Jackson. Here you are.

01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:20.188
- Well, thank you.
- Okay.

01:45:22.024 --> 01:45:23.483
She's been in there way too Iong.

01:45:23.567 --> 01:45:25.568
She's not. She hasn't been,
and she's doing a mission.

01:45:25.694 --> 01:45:27.654
Very dangerous work she's doing.

01:45:27.738 --> 01:45:30.073
You're just...
You know what? You're such a...

01:45:30.199 --> 01:45:32.909
I'd hate to be cliff-diving with you.

01:45:40.626 --> 01:45:42.502
Look, I saw this in a movie once.

01:45:42.586 --> 01:45:45.004
You go east, I go west,
we meet in the subway.

01:45:45.089 --> 01:45:46.130
We'll make it out alive.

01:45:46.215 --> 01:45:49.175
I'm not running with you. Okay?

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:52.470
I'm not running down the street
Iike some biatch.

01:45:52.555 --> 01:45:54.514
Like some biatch, okay?

01:45:54.598 --> 01:45:56.849
Wait. What are you talking about, fool?

01:45:56.934 --> 01:45:59.102
I'm committed to see this through.

01:45:59.228 --> 01:46:01.271
You know what they'll do with you
with that mustache in jail?

01:46:01.397 --> 01:46:03.231
You better not snitch.

01:46:03.899 --> 01:46:05.525
- Please.
- You kill me.

01:46:05.609 --> 01:46:06.693
- There she is.
- Oh, my goodness.

01:46:06.777 --> 01:46:09.988
- Jack, you kill me.
- Now, our cover.

01:46:10.072 --> 01:46:11.447
- Yes, thank you.
- She got it.

01:46:11.574 --> 01:46:15.159
But if there's anything else you need,
you call Jack Goldenberg directly.

01:46:15.244 --> 01:46:16.953
I certainly will. I certainly will.

01:46:17.288 --> 01:46:19.080
- May I help you?
- Oh, you're delightful.

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:21.291
- What a Iovely woman.
- No. I've got it. I've got it.

01:46:21.417 --> 01:46:23.543
You got to stop flirting with me.
You ain't getting nothing.

01:46:23.627 --> 01:46:26.462
I see you Iooking at my ass.
Don't you do that. Don't you do that.

01:46:26.589 --> 01:46:28.631
- I would never do that.
- Stop that flirting with me.

01:46:28.757 --> 01:46:30.758
- What a woman. What a woman.
- Thank you so much.

01:46:30.884 --> 01:46:33.261
- I'll see you Iater. AII right.
- Well, our pleasure again.

01:46:33.387 --> 01:46:34.596
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

01:46:34.722 --> 01:46:36.472
- Let's go.
- Yes.

01:46:48.068 --> 01:46:50.612
Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:53.072
Well, what did he say?

01:46:53.449 --> 01:46:59.162
Well, he's not very happy and neither am I
that you took my aunt up to New York.

01:46:59.288 --> 01:47:00.997
To that bank. That's crazy.

01:47:01.123 --> 01:47:04.375
But he's getting a Iot of calls
from the charities, they're very happy.

01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:08.129
The press is very excited about it,
so he's okay, and so am I.

01:47:08.631 --> 01:47:11.382
Well, what does that mean for me?

01:47:11.467 --> 01:47:14.886
You've helped us gather enough information
and evidence against your former bosses

01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:17.138
that we got a pretty solid case.

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:18.848
With that information, we pressured them,

01:47:18.974 --> 01:47:20.933
and they've agreed to testify
against the Malone family,

01:47:21.018 --> 01:47:22.060
so they won't be after you.

01:47:22.144 --> 01:47:25.647
So we just talked about
dropping the charges against you.

01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:29.275
What you did,
getting those accounts back in order,

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:32.695
and having all that money wired
back to the charities, all 13 of them,

01:47:33.947 --> 01:47:35.740
it's really great.

01:47:35.824 --> 01:47:39.452
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was.

01:47:39.536 --> 01:47:40.828
You're free to go, George.

01:47:40.954 --> 01:47:42.830
- So I'm free?
- Yeah.

01:47:43.916 --> 01:47:44.999
Enjoy your Iife, George.

01:47:45.084 --> 01:47:48.002
Take care of yourself.
Stay out of trouble.

01:47:48.087 --> 01:47:56.594
Thank you.

01:47:57.179 --> 01:47:58.680
The other way.

01:47:59.807 --> 01:48:01.140
Thank you.

01:48:03.435 --> 01:48:06.854
This has been Iovely.
It's just been so fun having y'all here.

01:48:06.939 --> 01:48:09.190
Madea, thank you.

01:48:09.316 --> 01:48:10.942
Thanks for everything.

01:48:11.026 --> 01:48:13.778
You have no idea how much
I wanna say, "Get the hell out."

01:48:13.862 --> 01:48:16.781
But I'm holding that in, because
I'm showing so much Iove to you.

01:48:16.865 --> 01:48:18.282
I enjoyed having y'all here.

01:48:18.367 --> 01:48:20.326
The best part about company
is when they Ieave.

01:48:20.703 --> 01:48:22.829
I'm gonna miss you so much, Madea.

01:48:23.205 --> 01:48:27.208
That's okay, child. AII them potatoes
in my house is glad you Ieaving.

01:48:27.292 --> 01:48:28.793
- Me, too.
- Yeah?

01:48:28.877 --> 01:48:30.545
Can we come back and visit?

01:48:32.881 --> 01:48:34.882
That is so sweet.
You wanna come back and visit?

01:48:34.967 --> 01:48:37.468
No, I don't think so. I'm sorry.

01:48:37.553 --> 01:48:38.636
You can write me Ietters, though.

01:48:38.721 --> 01:48:42.807
Long, Iong, Iong Ietters. Dissertations
from very, very, very far away.

01:48:42.891 --> 01:48:44.308
Negros.

01:48:48.689 --> 01:48:51.315
Okay, time to get her the hell out of here.

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.735
- Spirituals.
- Now she gets it.

01:48:53.861 --> 01:48:57.071
Okay, Mom, Iet's go. One Iast time.

01:48:57.156 --> 01:48:58.489
Let's go.

01:48:59.867 --> 01:49:02.160
There's my boy. There's my boy.

01:49:02.244 --> 01:49:04.203
Bye, Joe. I'll be back.

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:07.582
I'll be back, Joe. Bye.

01:49:07.708 --> 01:49:09.250
- Y'all, come on.
- Bye.

01:49:09.334 --> 01:49:11.252
Mabel, get them the hell out of here now.

01:49:11.336 --> 01:49:12.503
I'll see y'all around.

01:49:13.046 --> 01:49:14.922
Bye. Bye.

01:49:15.048 --> 01:49:16.382
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:49:30.898 --> 01:49:31.898
Yes!

01:49:45.078 --> 01:49:46.746
- Love you, Dad.
- Love you, Son.

01:50:23.492 --> 01:50:24.492
Yeah!

01:50:25.369 --> 01:50:27.286
I did that. I got that money, baby.

01:50:27.412 --> 01:50:30.498
I got that money!

01:50:35.754 --> 01:50:37.463
I don't want to go to prison,
because, you know?

01:50:37.548 --> 01:50:39.632
Food is bad,
I'm probably gonna Iose weight.

01:50:39.716 --> 01:50:42.510
Probably go down to nothing
and get gang-raped.

01:50:42.594 --> 01:50:44.512
I don't wanna shower in prison.

01:50:44.596 --> 01:50:48.307
They can do strange things to you in prison.

01:50:48.392 --> 01:50:50.017
Do you understand? Do you understand?

01:50:50.102 --> 01:50:54.397
I think I can handle myself. I really do.

01:50:54.523 --> 01:50:57.191
I really do. I just don't want
to go through the experience

01:50:57.276 --> 01:50:59.360
of having to do that. Okay?

01:50:59.444 --> 01:51:01.863
I don't want to have to worry
about other guys in there.

01:51:01.947 --> 01:51:05.241
When I get so mad,
I'm gonna have to use my fists,

01:51:05.325 --> 01:51:07.743
you know, just to defend myself.

01:51:07.828 --> 01:51:10.121
Go upstairs and get your mom's pills.

01:51:10.205 --> 01:51:14.041
- Find a Iittle straitjacket and calm down...
- And a straitjacket, too.

01:51:14.126 --> 01:51:15.751
Figure this out, Maysie.

01:51:15.836 --> 01:51:17.295
And then you put in that fatback grease,

01:51:17.379 --> 01:51:19.672
and you make sure it just sits there
and soak, so it'll be Iight.

01:51:19.756 --> 01:51:21.132
I got some oatmeal on the stove,

01:51:21.216 --> 01:51:23.301
and I got some greens
that's gonna clean you out.

01:51:23.385 --> 01:51:25.011
It's Iike none of this is gonna matter.

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:27.555
AII right.

01:51:27.639 --> 01:51:30.182
That's pretty good for never doing it.

01:51:30.976 --> 01:51:32.226
Oh, boy.

01:51:33.645 --> 01:51:36.022
- Is she doing it, too? Wow.
- Yeah.

01:51:36.565 --> 01:51:38.482
She kept her promise.

01:51:38.567 --> 01:51:40.526
- What the hell? Charlie Sheen.
- Hey. What a surprise.

01:51:40.611 --> 01:51:42.945
How are you? Look who back here.
Look who back here hiding.

01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:44.071
It's Charlie Sheen.

01:51:44.156 --> 01:51:45.573
- Big fan.
- I'm a big fan of yours, too.

01:51:45.657 --> 01:51:46.824
I've wanted to do this ever since... I'm sorry.

01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:49.493
- That's freaky. That's freaky. That's freaky.
- Damn. Sorry, sorry.

01:51:49.578 --> 01:51:52.163
Go on. Go on, rest yourself. Rest yourself.

01:51:52.247 --> 01:51:54.707
- No motorboating. No motorboating.
- Cut.

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:56.500
Where's Howie?

01:51:56.585 --> 01:51:58.794
Oh, God, you don't even want to know
what happened to Howie.

01:51:58.879 --> 01:52:00.504
It was so awful.

01:52:00.589 --> 01:52:03.299
They just told me there was
a buffalo and a monkey somewhere,

01:52:03.383 --> 01:52:07.136
and I just have not been able to figure
how they got out of the zoo.

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:08.721
I'm sorry.

01:52:10.015 --> 01:52:12.642
I am 6'4" tall and a woman.

01:52:12.726 --> 01:52:14.727
Do you think I have self-esteem issues?

01:52:14.811 --> 01:52:17.521
I ain't never played for the WNBA,
but I could.

01:52:17.606 --> 01:52:19.398
I ain't got no self-esteem issues, hell.

01:52:19.483 --> 01:52:23.152
I got a mustache. Do you understand?
I'm a dude up under this stuff.

01:52:23.654 --> 01:52:27.573
Sorry, this is Precious Jackson.
I'm in the Presidential Suite.

01:52:27.824 --> 01:52:31.035
And there are two toilets here.

01:52:31.119 --> 01:52:35.331
And I was trying to figure out,
which one am I supposed to use?

01:52:35.415 --> 01:52:40.294
I don't know which one suits me best.
One of them has things on it Iike a faucet.

01:52:40.921 --> 01:52:42.630
What is that for?

01:52:45.217 --> 01:52:47.385
Yes, you know how you turn on the faucet.

01:52:50.055 --> 01:52:52.765
I'm not a sir, I'm a ma'am.
You don't hear me, honey?

01:52:54.142 --> 01:52:56.978
Okay, yes, there's two toilets here.

01:52:57.062 --> 01:53:00.356
There's one that I recognize and
then there's one that I don't recognize.

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:04.276
It's got two handles on it, Iike you gonna
wash your hands or something.

01:53:04.361 --> 01:53:06.195
A bidet? What is a bidet, honey?

01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:10.157
I don't need Bengays and all that stuff.
Just trying to figure out what the toilet is.

01:53:16.289 --> 01:53:18.082
Right. Your hands?

01:53:20.293 --> 01:53:22.336
It's for washing your ass?

01:53:25.882 --> 01:53:28.175
No, when I wanna wash my ass,
I take a bath, honey.

01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:30.469
That's just nasty. Now who'd do that?

01:53:33.348 --> 01:53:35.808
Listen, I didn't know
you were gonna answer the phone.

01:53:35.892 --> 01:53:38.394
I thought the phone was disconnected.
I'm so sorry.

01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:40.855
Okay. I'll talk to you Iater. Bye.

01:53:42.357 --> 01:53:43.774
There was actually somebody there?

01:53:43.859 --> 01:53:46.819
Yes. Yes, the whole time.

01:53:46.903 --> 01:53:49.780
She was trying to explain to me what it was.

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:53.659
I'd Iike to order one of your famous...

01:53:55.454 --> 01:53:59.081
Baby, this say hamburgers $45.
What the hell is on the burger?

01:54:00.333 --> 01:54:03.961
No, no, no. For $45,
there better be more than a hamburger.

01:54:05.464 --> 01:54:09.842
For $45, it better get up in this bed
and roll around with me for a Iittle while.

01:54:11.178 --> 01:54:13.554
You don't think that's funny. Okay.

01:54:13.638 --> 01:54:17.058
No. Do you have chicken wings?

01:54:19.186 --> 01:54:20.227
You don't do those.

01:54:20.312 --> 01:54:23.397
Well, maybe you can ask the chef
to prepare them for me, then.

01:54:24.483 --> 01:54:25.691
Yes.

01:54:25.776 --> 01:54:30.029
How many would I Iike? That depends.
How many are there in the order?

01:54:31.656 --> 01:54:35.576
Okay, seven chicken wings. Okay.
How much are the seven chicken wings?

01:54:39.164 --> 01:54:40.539
$30 a wing?

01:54:41.833 --> 01:54:43.793
30 damn dollars a wing?

01:54:45.087 --> 01:54:47.671
You crazy as hell. People pay that?

01:54:48.465 --> 01:54:51.258
No, honey, I can't.
$30 for a damn chicken wing?

01:54:51.343 --> 01:54:52.843
Do you know that I can get 20 of them,

01:54:52.928 --> 01:54:55.721
they come in a pack,
20 for $1 .99 down at Roscoe's?

01:54:55.806 --> 01:54:58.891
I can't have this, honey.
No, I'm gonna starve in this hotel.

01:54:59.392 --> 01:55:04.522
My name is Precious Jackson.

01:55:05.357 --> 01:55:08.150
My name is Melinda.

01:55:08.819 --> 01:55:10.486
Hello, I'm Precious Jackson.

01:55:10.570 --> 01:55:13.405
Yo. Yo, what's up? I'm Precious.
They call me Precious.

01:55:27.045 --> 01:55:29.630
I thought you were, you know,
some tough guy from the hood?

01:55:29.714 --> 01:55:31.841
You know, "My biggest nightmare."

01:55:31.925 --> 01:55:35.469
Thug Iife, fool. Thug Iife, fool.

01:55:35.887 --> 01:55:38.722
Do me a favor. Send your old man
some money every now and then.

01:55:38.807 --> 01:55:40.933
Just a Iittle something.
It ain't got to be nothing.

01:55:41.017 --> 01:55:44.311
Just four, five, $20,000, $30,000 a month
or something, you know?

01:55:46.231 --> 01:55:47.398
You okay?

01:55:47.482 --> 01:55:51.735
I'll put a Iittle something in an envelope.
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:56.407
Okay. And Iisten, don't write no checks,
'cause I got a Iittle trouble with the IRS.

01:55:56.491 --> 01:55:58.534
Okay. Well, it'll just be cash.

01:55:58.618 --> 01:56:00.995
- Okay, good.
- Just be cash. That's the cleanest.

01:56:01.079 --> 01:56:03.622
Yeah, yeah,
that's the way the dope boy do it.

01:56:03.707 --> 01:56:06.167
- You can spend cash.
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

01:56:06.251 --> 01:56:10.671
I know a Iot of ways to spend them.
I'll be making it rain.

01:56:10.755 --> 01:56:12.798
- Joe, a real pleasure meeting you.
- Yeah?

01:56:12.883 --> 01:56:14.884
- Yeah, get your hand off me, son.
- I'm sorry.

01:56:14.968 --> 01:56:16.886
I don't Iike people touching me.
Folks don't wash their hands.

01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:18.929
AII right, Dad.

01:56:19.014 --> 01:56:20.556
- AII right, son. Son.
- Dad.

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.099
- Okay.

01:56:22.184 --> 01:56:24.143
- I Iove you now.
- I Iove you, too, Dad.

01:56:24.227 --> 01:56:26.979
I Iove you.
I Iove you with the Iove of the Lord.

01:56:27.063 --> 01:56:28.230
He thinks I'm his son.

01:56:28.607 --> 01:56:31.108
Well, this has been a Iovely, Iovely, Iovely...

01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:33.360
Been a great movie. Didn't you enjoy it?

01:56:33.445 --> 01:56:34.570
Good night.
