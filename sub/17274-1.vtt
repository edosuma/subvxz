00:01.022 --> 00:02.640
<i>Previously on</i>
Covert Affairs...

00:02.881 --> 00:04.749
I just keep thinking
that it's got to stop.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.000
It has to end.

00:06.084 --> 00:08.836
We have to find someplace
more normal, but--

00:08.921 --> 00:10.441
For people like us,
there is no normal.

00:10.472 --> 00:12.723
So is that it?
Is this the end?

00:12.791 --> 00:14.291
I guess so.

00:14.343 --> 00:16.677
You want me as D.C.S.?
What about Joan Campbell?

00:16.762 --> 00:17.962
She'll have a chance
to properly compete

00:18.013 --> 00:18.980
for the job
when the time comes.

00:19.064 --> 00:20.104
Is that who I think it is?

00:20.165 --> 00:21.799
Do you think
it's Khalid Ansari,

00:21.850 --> 00:23.818
son of one of the most powerful
oil men in Saudi Arabia?

00:23.902 --> 00:25.486
Assad believes Khalid
is moving money

00:25.571 --> 00:27.304
through charities
to terror organizations.

00:27.356 --> 00:28.856
Killing you
would be the easiest thing

00:28.941 --> 00:31.442
in the world right now,
but it won't solve anything.

00:33.362 --> 00:35.980
You went after Arthur
and Joan.

00:36.031 --> 00:38.499
You've crossed
every line, Henry.

00:39.818 --> 00:41.002
When you get back,

00:41.086 --> 00:42.670
there's somebody
who wants to meet you.

00:42.754 --> 00:44.872
It's a boy.
Mackenzie Campbell.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.290
I'll see you back in D.C.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.555 --> 01:35.139
This is interesting, man.

01:35.206 --> 01:37.425
Okay, nobody debates,
right,

01:37.509 --> 01:38.843
that the Italians
invented pizza,

01:38.894 --> 01:40.011
but in the case of the calzone,

01:40.062 --> 01:41.562
you've got the Swedish,
the Greeks,

01:41.647 --> 01:42.980
even the Scottish claim it.

01:43.048 --> 01:44.715
Stop it.
You're making me hungry.

01:44.766 --> 01:47.768
Well, we can order some--

01:47.853 --> 01:49.737
Auggie.

01:58.196 --> 01:59.196
Hello?

02:07.072 --> 02:08.372
Thank you.

02:12.127 --> 02:13.127
Annie's back.

02:15.264 --> 02:17.214
- What did she say?
- Voice mail.

02:17.266 --> 02:19.600
Outgoing message
says she wants to meet me alone

02:19.685 --> 02:20.885
on the mall in an hour.

02:20.936 --> 02:22.419
We reverse-tracked
Annie's entrance

02:22.471 --> 02:24.922
into the metro system, traced
her as far back as Albany.

02:24.973 --> 02:26.054
Before that, she's a ghost.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.525
What does that suggest to you?

02:27.592 --> 02:30.027
That she doesn't want us
to know where she's coming from.

02:30.095 --> 02:31.395
Four months off the grid.

02:31.446 --> 02:32.527
Suddenly she wants to meet.

02:32.531 --> 02:33.781
Why alone?
Why now?

02:33.865 --> 02:35.099
I don't know, Calder.

02:35.150 --> 02:38.102
I imagined a different
sort of homecoming.

02:43.441 --> 02:44.441
Auggie.

02:50.115 --> 02:51.115
Annie.

02:56.171 --> 02:58.756
Thanks for coming alone.

03:01.476 --> 03:04.729
You look good.
I've taken up judo.

03:04.796 --> 03:08.566
You should check it out.
It's a hoot.

03:08.633 --> 03:11.018
It's good to see you too.

03:12.654 --> 03:14.304
I know there have got to be
a lot of questions

03:14.356 --> 03:16.240
about where I've been
and what I've been doing,

03:16.307 --> 03:19.360
but I'd like to come back
to work.

03:19.444 --> 03:20.444
Good.

03:20.495 --> 03:21.946
You should come back to Langley
with me.

03:21.997 --> 03:23.280
We didn't have to do this here,

03:23.332 --> 03:25.416
unless you wanted to hit
the Air and Space Museum first.

03:25.483 --> 03:27.818
I wanted to talk to you,

03:27.869 --> 03:33.157
to explain myself without prying
agency ears and eyes.

03:33.225 --> 03:35.042
What did you want to say?

03:35.127 --> 03:38.045
I'd like you
to be my handler again.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.998
I'd like to go back
to when things were simpler,

03:41.049 --> 03:43.551
before I went dark,
before Henry,

03:43.635 --> 03:45.936
before everything
got so messy.

03:48.807 --> 03:52.810
I've had a lot of time to think
about myself and the Agency,

03:52.861 --> 03:54.562
and I realize
that I can't do this job

03:54.646 --> 03:56.030
and have emotional attachments.

03:56.114 --> 04:00.284
I've got to concentrate
solely on the work.

04:01.703 --> 04:03.904
I hope that's okay.

04:03.989 --> 04:07.742
Annie, you dropped off the map
there for a while.

04:07.826 --> 04:09.076
Time passed.
We're good.

04:11.413 --> 04:12.413
Really?

04:12.414 --> 04:15.299
Yeah, really.

04:16.885 --> 04:19.086
Why, did you want to make out
or something?

04:21.923 --> 04:24.308
Welcome back, Annie.

04:42.828 --> 04:44.328
Let's start again
from the beginning.

04:44.395 --> 04:46.396
After Hong Kong,
you went to Turkey,

04:46.448 --> 04:47.915
the Datca Peninsula.

04:47.999 --> 04:50.084
Yes.
You had spotters there.

04:50.168 --> 04:51.401
But you evaded our spotters.

04:51.453 --> 04:52.703
Where did you go?

04:52.754 --> 04:56.424
To another beach,
Fatu Hiva, South Pacific.

04:56.508 --> 04:59.043
For the last four months?

04:59.094 --> 05:01.095
Yes.

05:01.179 --> 05:03.080
And now I'm ready to return
to the Agency

05:03.131 --> 05:05.182
I faithfully served
for four years.

05:05.250 --> 05:06.767
Any other locations?

05:06.852 --> 05:07.968
No.

05:08.053 --> 05:09.533
Did you have contact
with any spies...

05:09.554 --> 05:11.255
What does the machine say?

05:11.306 --> 05:14.141
Line is steady
on every question.

05:14.226 --> 05:17.812
That would indicate
she's telling the truth,

05:17.896 --> 05:19.647
but she's not.

05:21.283 --> 05:23.267
What's she holding back?

05:30.536 --> 05:34.536

05:44.737 --> 05:46.822
So...

05:46.906 --> 05:48.040
You passed.

05:48.107 --> 05:50.375
Not so fast.

05:50.443 --> 05:53.128
What are you not
telling us, Annie?

05:53.213 --> 05:54.453
You just said
I passed the poly.

05:54.497 --> 05:56.048
You beat the poly.

05:56.115 --> 05:58.417
The machine doesn't know you
like Auggie and I know you.

05:58.468 --> 05:59.868
You want to tell us
what's going on?

05:59.886 --> 06:01.620
I took out Henry Wilcox.

06:01.671 --> 06:03.288
I took four months off,

06:03.339 --> 06:05.007
and now I'm ready
to come back to work.

06:07.844 --> 06:09.144
Calder.

06:09.229 --> 06:10.629
Line one.
Priority.

06:20.907 --> 06:23.642
Calder Michaels.

06:23.693 --> 06:25.861
Auggie.

06:25.945 --> 06:28.413
Can you talk to him?

06:28.481 --> 06:30.532
I can, but...

06:30.617 --> 06:31.750
But what?

06:31.817 --> 06:34.253
But it's a valid question.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.672
We're just trying to look out
for you, Annie.

06:36.756 --> 06:37.873
Things changed.

06:37.957 --> 06:39.824
A very dangerous friend of yours
was just spotted

06:39.876 --> 06:41.343
in a surveillance camera
in Chicago.

06:41.427 --> 06:44.346
Who?

06:44.430 --> 06:46.498
Khalid Ansari.

06:46.549 --> 06:48.350
Khalid Ansari's
on American soil?

06:48.434 --> 06:49.834
Exactly.
This is major.

06:49.886 --> 06:51.970
Guy like Khalid
is smart, careful.

06:52.021 --> 06:54.506
He's on all the watch lists.
Why would he take that risk?

06:54.557 --> 06:56.841
He dropped out of sight
in Riyadh a few days ago,

06:56.893 --> 06:59.528
but we never thought
he'd reappear on U.S. soil.

06:59.612 --> 07:01.313
Annie, you know this guy.

07:01.364 --> 07:02.981
We need you in Chicago.

07:03.032 --> 07:04.616
We have
an off-book facility there.

07:04.684 --> 07:05.684
You'll meet with the chief.

07:05.735 --> 07:06.735
He'll get you set up.

07:06.736 --> 07:08.186
I understand.

07:10.073 --> 07:11.073
Hold up.

07:11.074 --> 07:12.354
Don't think we're finished here.

07:30.593 --> 07:32.377
Walker.

07:32.428 --> 07:34.212
Welcome.

07:34.264 --> 07:35.480
I'm Charles Schinderman.

07:35.548 --> 07:37.482
Auggie Anderson
spoke very highly of you.

07:37.550 --> 07:38.684
I hope so.

07:38.735 --> 07:40.885
He was the best man
at my wedding.

07:40.937 --> 07:42.904
Guy gives a hell of a toast.

07:48.578 --> 07:50.579
I'm sorry about the mess.

07:50.663 --> 07:52.247
This is my wife's car.

07:52.332 --> 07:55.033
Mine is in the shop
with a timing-belt issue.

07:57.570 --> 07:58.920
Let's get you to the facility.

08:06.012 --> 08:08.463
I didn't think Khalid Ansari
would risk coming stateside.

08:08.548 --> 08:10.432
One of the most wanted men
in financing terror

08:10.516 --> 08:12.551
pings inside the loop...

08:12.602 --> 08:14.136
Something big's gonna happen.

08:15.772 --> 08:17.022
My file says that you
were the one

08:17.089 --> 08:18.423
who turned him
against his father.

08:18.474 --> 08:19.641
I just gave Khalid
some facts.

08:19.726 --> 08:22.477
He killed his father
all on his own.

08:22.562 --> 08:23.695
Where are we at now?

08:23.763 --> 08:25.163
Right now
we're trying to figure out

08:25.231 --> 08:26.598
how he got in the country,

08:26.649 --> 08:28.066
what alias he may be using,

08:28.117 --> 08:29.651
who he's contacted.

08:29.736 --> 08:30.952
We're canvassing
the Muslim community

08:31.037 --> 08:32.486
trying to figure out
who may be harboring him.

08:32.572 --> 08:33.789
That's not his style.

08:33.873 --> 08:35.741
Show his picture around
some of the luxury hotels.

08:35.792 --> 08:39.660
The ones who are most discreet
about high-end pros.

08:39.746 --> 08:41.580
He likes white girls,

08:41.631 --> 08:43.332
probably used a western name.

09:19.001 --> 09:20.335
So here we are,

09:20.420 --> 09:23.004
home sweet off-book home.

09:23.089 --> 09:26.174
You can drop your gear here
and make yourself comfortable.

09:31.214 --> 09:32.297
Scratch that.

09:32.348 --> 09:33.348
We've located Khalid.

09:33.349 --> 09:36.134
He's at the Bradham Hotel.

09:36.185 --> 09:37.719
Nice instincts, Walker.

09:43.843 --> 09:45.026
What are we looking at?

09:45.111 --> 09:47.145
Bell captain
says he checked into room 8273

09:47.196 --> 09:49.013
about an hour ago.

09:49.065 --> 09:50.505
All right,
let's keep it low profile.

09:50.533 --> 09:51.817
Four guys inside the hotel.

09:51.868 --> 09:53.235
No guns unless we have to.

09:53.319 --> 09:54.319
You're with us.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.288
You two seal off the exits.

10:18.845 --> 10:19.845
Jacob.

10:37.330 --> 10:38.330
Khalid.

10:41.784 --> 10:42.784
Stop.

10:42.785 --> 10:44.870
Annie Walker of the C.I.A.

10:44.921 --> 10:45.921
Of course it's you.

10:45.922 --> 10:47.122
I'm such a fool.

10:47.206 --> 10:48.590
Put the gun down.

10:48.674 --> 10:50.154
I can protect you.
You can protect me?

10:50.209 --> 10:51.543
Then tell them
to put their guns down!

10:51.594 --> 10:53.244
Tell them!

10:53.296 --> 10:55.580
Put your guns down.

10:55.631 --> 10:56.965
Put 'em down.

11:02.972 --> 11:05.173
You know me well enough to know
that what I say is true.

11:05.191 --> 11:07.926
There's a way out of this.

11:07.977 --> 11:09.528
You put the gun down.

11:09.595 --> 11:12.113
You tell me
what you're doing in Chicago,

11:12.198 --> 11:14.483
and we will walk out
of here together.

11:14.567 --> 11:15.617
You don't know?

11:22.775 --> 11:24.543
Then I'm an even bigger fool.

11:24.610 --> 11:26.110
Know what, Khalid?

11:26.162 --> 11:28.797
You think
you're in control.

11:28.881 --> 11:31.500
If these people
could do this to me,

11:31.584 --> 11:33.468
what chance
do you think you have?

11:33.553 --> 11:34.920
What people, Khalid?

11:36.556 --> 11:37.556
Khalid.

11:41.394 --> 11:42.477
They've given me no choice.

11:42.562 --> 11:43.795
Go.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.405
Sweep team is coming
for the body,

12:12.406 --> 12:13.540
and Khalid's possessions.

12:13.591 --> 12:16.626
I'll order up your charter back
to D.C. for you.

12:17.711 --> 12:20.129
You made a mistake
back there.

12:20.213 --> 12:22.181
What?
Saving your life?

12:22.248 --> 12:23.849
I knew Khalid Ansari,

12:23.917 --> 12:25.317
and I knew
he wasn't gonna shoot me.

12:25.385 --> 12:27.636
Besides, he never would have
got a shot off before me anyway,

12:27.721 --> 12:28.921
and now we have nothing.

12:28.972 --> 12:30.088
I don't know you,

12:30.140 --> 12:31.857
but I wasn't
about to let you die.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.443
You're right.
You don't know me.

12:34.528 --> 12:36.428
I don't quit.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.063
Now, let's go back
to the facility

12:38.114 --> 12:39.281
and figure this out.

12:44.321 --> 12:45.604
Auggie.

12:45.655 --> 12:46.822
Joan.

12:46.907 --> 12:48.874
I thought your maternity leave
ends next week.

12:48.942 --> 12:51.276
Yes, but Annie happened
this week,

12:51.328 --> 12:53.212
and now Khalid 25 minutes ago.

12:53.279 --> 12:54.747
She's doing all right.

12:54.798 --> 12:56.499
She's a different
operative now.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.667
She was in and out of here
so fast, I didn't even seen her.

12:58.752 --> 13:00.285
Yeah, her and Charlie
are drilling down

13:00.337 --> 13:02.137
on Khalid's purpose
in Chicago.

13:02.222 --> 13:04.757
Good.
Keep me posted.

13:04.808 --> 13:06.625
I'm meeting with the D.C.I.
Right now.

13:06.676 --> 13:08.677
Well, give them crap
for only spending five minutes

13:08.762 --> 13:10.462
at the Agency Christmas party,
would you?

13:10.514 --> 13:12.297
I most certainly will not.

13:14.401 --> 13:15.401
Auggie?

13:15.402 --> 13:16.402
Yeah?

13:19.856 --> 13:21.136
What do you think
Annie was up to

13:21.157 --> 13:23.242
for the last few months?

13:23.309 --> 13:24.777
She's being pretty vague.

13:24.828 --> 13:26.695
She says she was at the beach
the whole time.

13:26.780 --> 13:28.313
- And you believe her?
- No.

13:28.365 --> 13:30.165
And what about you two?

13:30.250 --> 13:32.084
Keeping things Balkanized.

13:32.151 --> 13:34.420
Operative and handler,
just like old times.

13:34.487 --> 13:35.921
Interesting analogy.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.172
I worked in the Balkans.

13:37.257 --> 13:39.491
It was complicated.

13:39.543 --> 13:41.377
Well, this isn't gonna be.

13:41.461 --> 13:44.930
Okay.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.666
Wish me luck.
Good luck.

13:47.717 --> 13:49.718
We found $800,000
in U.S. bills

13:49.803 --> 13:52.504
stuffed into the lining
of Khalid's suitcase.

13:52.556 --> 13:54.807
Saudi spy service,
they don't stand on ceremony,

13:54.858 --> 13:58.227
so we had them
raid Khalid's condo in Riyadh.

13:58.311 --> 14:01.480
Contents of a safe there
led us to one local contact.

14:01.531 --> 14:03.649
Borz Altan,

14:03.700 --> 14:05.150
Crimean-American,

14:05.201 --> 14:06.318
Muslim,

14:06.369 --> 14:08.320
trips to Chechnya.

14:08.371 --> 14:09.788
Intriguing.

14:09.856 --> 14:12.157
In Borz's younger days,
he did U.S. military service,

14:12.208 --> 14:13.459
made it to sergeant,

14:13.526 --> 14:15.486
but his career stagnated
due to chronic migraines.

14:15.495 --> 14:17.713
After his service,
he worked for McQuaid Security

14:17.797 --> 14:19.298
for a short while?

14:19.365 --> 14:20.532
He flamed out fast.

14:20.584 --> 14:21.967
Tough culture,
those P.M.C.s,

14:22.035 --> 14:23.218
worse than the military.

14:23.303 --> 14:25.971
Get me what you can
from McQuaid Security.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.139
Tight-knit family.

14:27.206 --> 14:28.686
Lives with
his younger brother Mykola,

14:28.708 --> 14:31.043
26, religious,

14:31.094 --> 14:33.012
travels to Yemen,
which is never great,

14:33.063 --> 14:34.396
couple of felonies
for theft.

14:34.481 --> 14:37.516
Anything else
I should know?

14:37.567 --> 14:40.269
There's a sister, Oksana,
lives with them as well.

14:40.353 --> 14:41.887
Anything else you should know,
meaning?

14:41.938 --> 14:45.057
I'm gonna move
on Borz immediately.

14:45.108 --> 14:46.892
It's not the best conditions
for an approach.

14:46.943 --> 14:49.561
We don't know his role here
or how he's connected to Khalid.

14:49.613 --> 14:51.080
These are the cards
we've been dealt,

14:51.164 --> 14:52.915
so I'm going to play
this hand.

14:54.834 --> 14:55.901
Well, now I get it.

14:55.952 --> 14:57.903
What?

14:57.954 --> 14:59.538
Why Auggie was so into you.

15:08.131 --> 15:10.182
Calder.

15:10.249 --> 15:13.969
Hey, Joan.

15:14.054 --> 15:15.938
I thought
I was meeting with the D.C.I.

15:16.022 --> 15:17.940
I did too.

15:18.024 --> 15:20.275
Calder.
Joan.

15:20.360 --> 15:22.645
Joe.
Where's the D.C.I.?

15:22.729 --> 15:25.898
- Got pulled into a meeting.
- This is a meeting.

15:25.949 --> 15:28.567
I'm his deputy.
I speak for him in his absence.

15:28.618 --> 15:30.602
Okay.
What does he have to say?

15:30.654 --> 15:32.437
He's decided to keep you,
Calder,

15:32.489 --> 15:34.490
in your current post
as D.C.S.,

15:34.574 --> 15:38.961
and to put you, Joan,
back as head of the D.P.D.

15:39.045 --> 15:41.797
I understand the seriousness
of the Chicago situation,

15:41.881 --> 15:43.841
but I thought there'd be
a proper vetting process.

15:43.883 --> 15:44.967
So did I.

15:45.051 --> 15:46.552
Specifically told
the general counsel.

15:46.619 --> 15:48.387
His decision
wasn't based on Chicago.

15:48.454 --> 15:49.955
And the D.C.I.
couldn't come down here

15:50.006 --> 15:51.090
and tell us himself?

15:51.141 --> 15:52.925
And it is final.

15:57.514 --> 15:59.648
I'll report to the D.P.D.
on Monday.

16:01.234 --> 16:02.317
Calder, a word.

16:04.938 --> 16:07.305
Okay.

16:07.357 --> 16:09.074
Look, Joe,
I really wish you guys

16:09.142 --> 16:10.662
would have given me a heads-up
on this.

16:10.694 --> 16:12.828
Look, you've been
a really great acting D.C.S.,

16:12.912 --> 16:14.530
but you're not official yet.

16:14.614 --> 16:16.165
D.C.I. says
you're to remain interim

16:16.249 --> 16:19.668
until your affairs in order,
and then we'll take you overt.

16:19.753 --> 16:20.753
What does that mean?

16:20.787 --> 16:23.505
It means
get your shit together.

16:29.095 --> 16:32.164
Joan.
Joan.

16:32.215 --> 16:33.298
I'm sorry.

16:33.349 --> 16:34.509
I'm just as surprised as you.

16:34.551 --> 16:36.769
This is not how I wanted it
to go down.

16:36.836 --> 16:38.020
Well, it went down.

16:38.104 --> 16:40.022
Yeah.

16:40.106 --> 16:41.140
Make no mistake.

16:41.191 --> 16:42.941
I wanted this job,

16:43.009 --> 16:44.843
but I was not gonna go
around anybody's back

16:44.894 --> 16:46.278
to get it,
especially not yours.

16:46.345 --> 16:48.030
I don't think
you went around my back.

16:48.114 --> 16:49.948
I think you took advantage
of a situation.

16:50.016 --> 16:51.984
No.
None of the above.

16:52.035 --> 16:54.036
You may not want to hear this,

16:54.120 --> 16:57.689
but Arthur
didn't do you any favors.

16:57.741 --> 16:59.324
For all the good he did,

16:59.375 --> 17:01.176
people in this building
were talking about him

17:01.211 --> 17:03.879
a lot last year.

17:03.963 --> 17:05.547
The smartest place
is in the shadows.

17:35.195 --> 17:36.195
Yes?

17:36.196 --> 17:37.729
I'm looking for Borz Altan.

17:37.781 --> 17:39.531
I'm from Veterans Affairs.

17:44.671 --> 17:45.754
Borz.

17:52.245 --> 17:53.712
Borz Altan?

17:53.763 --> 17:55.964
I'm from the V.A.
I called before?

17:56.049 --> 17:58.634
I may have some good news
about your benefits.

18:01.688 --> 18:03.438
May I come in?

18:03.523 --> 18:06.424
Yeah, sure.
Come on in.

18:08.394 --> 18:10.595
Is that your girlfriend?

18:10.647 --> 18:11.647
Sister.

18:11.648 --> 18:13.198
Oh, is she a nurse?

18:13.266 --> 18:15.117
She's actually a doctor.

18:15.201 --> 18:16.785
She got her degree in Kiev.

18:16.870 --> 18:18.603
Here she does nursing.

18:21.941 --> 18:25.210
So you said
you have good news?

18:25.278 --> 18:28.446
Yeah, there have been
some changes made to title 38,

18:28.498 --> 18:31.500
and you may be due more money
for your migraines.

18:33.253 --> 18:35.454
First time the army has ever
wanted to give me anything.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.172
What can I say?
Progress.

18:37.257 --> 18:40.125
We just need to fill out
your profile.

18:40.176 --> 18:41.810
Your name is Borz Altan,

18:41.895 --> 18:45.814
and you're originally
from Sevastopol?

18:45.899 --> 18:47.015
That's right, yeah.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.851
And you live here
with your siblings,

18:48.935 --> 18:51.636
your brother Mykola?

18:51.688 --> 18:53.939
And my sister Oksana.

18:53.990 --> 18:55.807
Right.

18:55.859 --> 18:59.477
Do you happen to have
your old army I.D.?

18:59.529 --> 19:01.313
I need to verify it
for these forms.

19:04.584 --> 19:06.368
Yeah.
Let me get it.

19:36.399 --> 19:37.682
Here you go.

19:39.402 --> 19:40.402
Thanks.

19:40.403 --> 19:41.703
Is there anything else?

19:41.788 --> 19:44.623
No, I'll leave you
with these forms to fill out,

19:44.690 --> 19:47.025
and I can pick them up later.

19:47.076 --> 19:50.028
Thank you very much.
It was a pleasure to meet you.

19:51.297 --> 19:53.048
Charlie,
they had ceremonial plates

19:53.132 --> 19:54.583
and a special occasion
prayer rug

19:54.667 --> 19:56.969
suggesting <i>salat Al-ghaib.</i>

19:57.036 --> 19:59.388
They're mourning a martyr
before the attack.

19:59.472 --> 20:01.390
Something
is gonna happen today.

21:55.421 --> 21:56.421
Doctor's office.

21:56.422 --> 21:57.506
Yes, this is Lisa Morton.

21:57.590 --> 22:00.375
Could I speak with Dr. Cohen,
please?

22:06.966 --> 22:10.302
Yes, could you tell him
that I just had an episode,

22:10.353 --> 22:12.104
and can he call me back?

22:13.856 --> 22:14.973
Thank you.

22:21.721 --> 22:24.046
We need to find Borz,
Mykola or Oksana

22:24.047 --> 22:25.047
and pull them in.

22:25.048 --> 22:26.115
If they're operational,

22:26.166 --> 22:27.566
we can't risk
having them out there.

22:27.617 --> 22:29.257
We've got a secure A.P.B.
out on the wire.

22:29.286 --> 22:30.753
Next step is to raise
the threat level,

22:30.804 --> 22:32.472
but I think
we should hold a beat

22:32.556 --> 22:33.639
until we have more info.

22:33.724 --> 22:34.964
What about the file
we asked for

22:35.008 --> 22:36.392
from McQuaid security?

22:36.459 --> 22:38.460
Is there anything in there
that can help us track Borz?

22:38.512 --> 22:41.180
To call it a file
is generous.

22:44.067 --> 22:45.067
I need to speak to him.

22:45.068 --> 22:46.235
Get his liaison on the phone.

22:46.303 --> 22:48.688
No, I want to speak
to McQuaid himself.

22:48.772 --> 22:50.573
If his C.I.A. contracts
mean anything,

22:50.640 --> 22:51.640
he'll get on the phone.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.646
Hey.
Hi.

22:57.698 --> 22:58.748
No nap?

22:58.815 --> 23:00.149
Oh, we were having
too much fun.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.951
How did it go
with the D.C.I.?

23:03.370 --> 23:06.706
He gave the D.C.S. job
to Calder.

23:06.790 --> 23:08.925
I can end around the G.C.O.,
why go down without a fight?

23:08.992 --> 23:09.992
No.
You know what?

23:10.043 --> 23:11.511
If I make a play
for the job so soon,

23:11.595 --> 23:12.995
it'll seem like sour grapes.

23:13.046 --> 23:14.630
I can't risk
taking another step back.

23:14.681 --> 23:15.848
So what do you think
happened?

23:19.336 --> 23:20.502
No need to dance
around it.

23:20.554 --> 23:22.805
They're trying to hurt you
because of me,

23:22.856 --> 23:24.256
but I stand behind everything
I did.

23:24.308 --> 23:25.391
I hope you can see that.

23:25.475 --> 23:29.511
Of course I do,
and others will in time.

23:31.148 --> 23:32.732
Got him.

23:32.816 --> 23:34.367
Thank you.

23:34.451 --> 23:35.985
Hello, Mr. McQuaid?

23:36.036 --> 23:37.203
I need to ask you
a few questions

23:37.287 --> 23:38.821
about Borz Altan.

23:38.872 --> 23:41.523
This isn't a great connection.
Can we talk in person?

23:41.575 --> 23:43.743
I don't have time to come back
to D.C. and talk in person.

23:43.827 --> 23:44.877
- Where are you?
- Chicago.

23:44.962 --> 23:46.462
Even better,
I can come to you.

23:46.529 --> 23:47.797
I'm already in the air,

23:47.864 --> 23:49.749
and I was headed from Dallas,
but I can divert.

23:49.833 --> 23:52.201
I'll be there in an hour.

24:04.815 --> 24:07.183
Walker?

24:07.234 --> 24:09.685
That's right.

24:09.736 --> 24:11.553
I did some recon on you
while I was in flight.

24:11.605 --> 24:12.605
And?

24:12.656 --> 24:13.896
Well,
based on what I found out,

24:13.941 --> 24:16.692
I was expecting you
to be a little more dead.

24:16.743 --> 24:19.228
Well, I'm here,
and I don't have much time.

24:19.279 --> 24:20.880
I have a few questions
to ask you about--

24:20.897 --> 24:23.165
Borz Altan?

24:23.233 --> 24:24.200
He did security work for me

24:24.251 --> 24:25.585
for four months
in Eastern Europe.

24:25.669 --> 24:27.753
That's kind of vague.
I think you can do better.

24:27.838 --> 24:28.955
Do you?

24:29.039 --> 24:30.072
Did he have any
specialized training?

24:30.123 --> 24:31.507
I mean, what exactly did
he do for you?

24:31.574 --> 24:33.614
You are aware that I have
confidentiality agreements

24:33.627 --> 24:35.177
with the agencies
that I contract with.

24:35.245 --> 24:36.846
Uh-huh. So translation,
you do know more,

24:36.880 --> 24:39.048
you just don't want to tell me
'cause you might lose money.

24:39.099 --> 24:40.516
Why do you want to know
all this anyway?

24:40.583 --> 24:41.944
It's a matter
of national security.

24:42.019 --> 24:45.638
So I assume it has to do
with the death of Khalid Ansari.

24:45.722 --> 24:46.922
That's right,
I know about him,

24:46.940 --> 24:48.590
because I'm cleared to know
about him.

24:48.642 --> 24:50.559
You know, an article I read
about you in <i>Forbes</i>

24:50.611 --> 24:52.428
says that you interview
every one

24:52.479 --> 24:54.447
of your employees personally,

24:54.531 --> 24:55.852
that they're like a family
to you.

24:55.866 --> 24:57.933
Is that true or bullshit?
That is true.

24:57.985 --> 24:59.785
So what do you remember
about Borz Altan?

25:02.406 --> 25:04.046
I only met him once.
We talked about cars.

25:04.107 --> 25:06.542
He loves Mustangs
and so do I.

25:06.609 --> 25:09.378
That's about all.
It was a brief chat.

25:09.446 --> 25:10.612
Does that help?

25:10.664 --> 25:12.298
It may, it may not.

25:12.382 --> 25:13.883
Anything else?

25:13.950 --> 25:17.003
I'm sorry.
That was all.

25:17.087 --> 25:19.138
Okay, then,
I think we're done.

25:23.143 --> 25:24.143
I like it.

25:24.144 --> 25:25.344
What?

25:25.429 --> 25:27.647
You're awfully direct.

25:27.731 --> 25:30.299
- It's a function of the job.
- No, it's not.

25:30.350 --> 25:32.935
Most spies I know
are lying sons of bitches.

25:32.986 --> 25:34.470
Well, I'm not most spies.

25:34.521 --> 25:36.805
And I would love to talk
about that more.

25:36.857 --> 25:39.025
Give me a call so we can chat
about some,

25:39.109 --> 25:40.943
you know,
other opportunities.

25:40.994 --> 25:42.662
Here's my card.

25:46.867 --> 25:48.868
What was it about
the conversation we just had

25:48.952 --> 25:51.420
that made you think
I would want to work for you?

25:51.488 --> 25:53.422
None of it.

25:53.490 --> 25:55.341
I'm asking you out to dinner.

26:04.267 --> 26:05.267
Ay!

26:10.857 --> 26:12.674
Okay, folks,
that's it.

26:12.726 --> 26:14.860
I get in trouble when you people
don't get your asses back

26:14.945 --> 26:17.012
to your desk
by the end of lunch.

26:17.064 --> 26:18.614
Great session.

26:20.850 --> 26:22.451
Auggie.
Hey.

26:22.519 --> 26:23.569
Great work today.

26:23.653 --> 26:24.904
Thanks, Marlo.

26:24.988 --> 26:27.156
Listen, if you wanted
to go over some more moves,

26:27.207 --> 26:29.041
I could stay late.

26:29.126 --> 26:31.693
Auggie,
urgent call for you.

26:31.745 --> 26:32.745
Rain check.

26:32.746 --> 26:34.046
Sure.

26:38.668 --> 26:40.669
Thanks.

26:40.721 --> 26:42.304
Hello?
It's me.

26:42.372 --> 26:44.507
Can you check on a Mustang
owned by the Altans?

26:44.558 --> 26:45.891
Got it.

26:45.976 --> 26:48.844
Hey, is Charlie still playing
with that coin of his?

26:48.895 --> 26:50.513
Yeah.

26:50.564 --> 26:53.065
Make fun of him for me,
would you?

26:53.150 --> 26:54.600
Got it.

26:54.684 --> 26:57.269
Call me back.

27:17.257 --> 27:18.374
Hey.

27:23.964 --> 27:26.882
Are you going
to that Pearson Awards thing?

27:28.602 --> 27:30.519
No.
Why?

27:30.587 --> 27:31.804
I was going.

27:31.888 --> 27:34.890
I didn't know
if I'd run into you there.

27:38.612 --> 27:41.697
No, I'm not going.

27:44.067 --> 27:47.319
Oh, I, um...

27:47.404 --> 27:50.873
I meant to give you this
earlier.

27:50.940 --> 27:54.443
It's a scrambled cell phone,
state of the art.

27:54.494 --> 27:56.378
I need you to use this

27:56.446 --> 27:58.414
to communicate with me
from now on.

27:58.465 --> 28:00.666
I'm discrete, Calder.

28:00.750 --> 28:01.750
You can trust me.

28:01.751 --> 28:02.835
Baby, I know,

28:02.919 --> 28:06.055
but I need you to do
this for me, okay?

28:06.122 --> 28:09.758
So it'll help me be discrete.

28:12.629 --> 28:14.930
All right.

28:14.981 --> 28:16.965
Whatever you need.

28:19.302 --> 28:21.520
- Whatever?
- Whatever.

28:30.647 --> 28:33.148
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I just landed.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.000
What do you think?

28:35.085 --> 28:36.752
I always knew
you had potential.

28:36.819 --> 28:38.153
Oh, but you still gave me
a "C"

28:38.205 --> 28:39.672
in Latin American
political systems.

28:39.756 --> 28:40.989
Well, it looks like
the student

28:41.041 --> 28:42.991
has surpassed
the teacher.

28:43.043 --> 28:45.661
Thank you, Arthur.

28:45.712 --> 28:47.546
So why the call
from the plane?

28:47.631 --> 28:49.265
Why am I here?
Why so urgent?

28:49.332 --> 28:50.812
Oh, you were always
very helpful to me

28:50.851 --> 28:52.101
when I was at Annapolis,

28:52.168 --> 28:53.835
and I thought maybe
I could pay a little back

28:53.887 --> 28:55.888
with some unsolicited advice.

28:55.972 --> 28:58.107
Oh,
this ought to be interesting.

28:58.174 --> 29:01.677
I heard about Joan
being passed over for D.C.S.

29:01.728 --> 29:03.062
That was fast.

29:03.146 --> 29:05.180
The D.C.I.
made the wrong move.

29:05.232 --> 29:07.066
You and Joan have given
your lives to the Agency,

29:07.150 --> 29:08.350
and this is how
you're treated.

29:08.368 --> 29:09.535
I mean, you on the outside,

29:09.619 --> 29:11.654
and Joan hitting
the glass ceiling.

29:11.705 --> 29:13.522
Neither of us is looking at it
that way.

29:17.026 --> 29:19.295
I want you to come work
with me.

29:19.362 --> 29:20.829
Become a green badge?

29:20.881 --> 29:23.299
I know that you've
been getting a lot of offers,

29:23.366 --> 29:25.584
Alexandria Associates,
P.F.W., Syncon,

29:25.669 --> 29:27.002
but over here
at McQuaid Security,

29:27.053 --> 29:28.754
we do things
a little differently,

29:28.838 --> 29:31.873
and it's not just because
I pay the most, which I do.

29:31.925 --> 29:35.094
Yeah, it's not just
about the money for me.

29:35.178 --> 29:37.713
Don't be afraid
of money, Arthur.

29:37.764 --> 29:38.981
It can pay
for almost anything.

29:39.048 --> 29:40.215
I mean, you have a new kid,

29:40.267 --> 29:41.901
you've given a lot of good years
to the Agency.

29:41.985 --> 29:43.519
You deserve to have
the opportunity

29:43.570 --> 29:45.905
to provide
for little mack.

29:45.989 --> 29:48.073
I haven't been
under a rock, Ryan.

29:48.158 --> 29:51.527
Your company grew exponentially
in the early years easy,

29:51.578 --> 29:54.246
but now you want to get
to the next level,

29:54.331 --> 29:55.948
and you're gonna need
deeper connections,

29:56.032 --> 29:57.416
greater access,

29:57.500 --> 29:59.702
and a guy with my experience
and my rolodex

29:59.753 --> 30:02.204
gives you a lot of options.

30:02.255 --> 30:05.341
All right.

30:05.408 --> 30:08.761
I need you Arthur.

30:08.845 --> 30:11.347
There, I said it.

30:11.414 --> 30:13.265
You and I could do a lot
of special things together

30:13.350 --> 30:16.518
and have a shitload of fun
doing it.

30:16.586 --> 30:19.271
I'll think about it.

30:19.356 --> 30:20.889
You think about it,
then you give me a call

30:20.941 --> 30:23.809
when you realize
that you really can have it all.

30:26.229 --> 30:27.446
I found your Mustang.

30:27.530 --> 30:28.930
Looks like
it's been abandoned.

30:28.982 --> 30:30.399
I'm going to check it out.

30:30.450 --> 30:32.534
It's not hear any landmarks,
so I doubt it's a bomb,

30:32.602 --> 30:34.236
but approach with caution.

31:56.780 --> 31:58.511
Chief found traces
of Semtek in the car.

31:58.771 --> 31:59.771
And the body?

31:59.772 --> 32:00.989
Name's Eduardo Cruz,

32:01.056 --> 32:03.324
lives in Evanston.

32:03.392 --> 32:04.826
Why would the Altans
go after him?

32:04.893 --> 32:07.946
He works the floor
at the Chicago Board of Trade.

32:08.030 --> 32:09.030
That's the target.

32:09.064 --> 32:10.281
I'll scramble
our TAC team now.

32:10.366 --> 32:12.834
I'll meet you there.

32:12.901 --> 32:15.086
We have a real
and credible threat

32:15.170 --> 32:16.671
on the Chicago Board of Trade.

32:16.738 --> 32:18.590
We already have a workup
on this scenario,

32:18.674 --> 32:20.458
as it was one
of the likely hard targets

32:20.542 --> 32:22.176
in the domestic threat matrix.

32:22.244 --> 32:23.595
Do we clear the building?

32:23.679 --> 32:25.746
If we clear the building
and suspend trading,

32:25.798 --> 32:27.048
we could create a panic,

32:27.116 --> 32:29.300
or we might trigger
the bombings early.

32:29.385 --> 32:31.752
Just like
in the Beirut bombing last year

32:31.804 --> 32:33.554
or the Lagos embassy bombing
of '07.

32:33.606 --> 32:34.889
But if we
let business proceed,

32:34.940 --> 32:36.274
we may be abetting the attack.

32:36.358 --> 32:38.359
We risk hundreds of deaths
that could be avoided.

32:38.427 --> 32:39.593
Our rapid response team

32:39.645 --> 32:42.030
with operative Walker on point
is moments way.

32:42.097 --> 32:44.282
Operative Walker has suggested
we proceed

32:44.366 --> 32:45.483
with a discreet sweep

32:45.567 --> 32:47.768
and allow the trading floor
to remain open.

32:47.820 --> 32:50.154
I strongly support this action.

32:58.297 --> 32:59.464
Keep trading open.

32:59.548 --> 33:00.832
Have the Chicago team
sweep the building

33:00.916 --> 33:02.634
quickly and quietly.

33:02.718 --> 33:03.751
Let's go.

33:08.924 --> 33:10.124
Thanks for backing my call.

33:10.175 --> 33:11.426
You got a raw deal, Joan,

33:11.477 --> 33:13.197
but it's good to have you back
in the D.P.D.

33:21.020 --> 33:22.020
What's the word?

33:22.104 --> 33:23.488
I just talked
to the head of security.

33:23.572 --> 33:25.823
No one has come in yet
with Eduardo Cruz's I.D. card.

33:25.908 --> 33:27.442
Trading is in full swing.

33:27.493 --> 33:29.410
It's prime opportunity
for an attack.

33:29.478 --> 33:31.079
Let's I.D. and take down.

33:31.146 --> 33:32.613
This is Mykola Altan.

33:32.665 --> 33:33.998
He most resembles
the dead trader

33:34.083 --> 33:35.199
we found in the car.

33:35.284 --> 33:36.284
Here you go.

33:36.335 --> 33:38.419
You can now trade
pork bellies.

33:38.487 --> 33:39.671
Let's do this quickly.

33:45.961 --> 33:47.512
The trading floor
is on the mezzanine.

33:47.596 --> 33:48.680
We can't let him get up there.

33:48.764 --> 33:49.845
You two take the back exit.

33:49.848 --> 33:51.332
I'm gonna take the stairs.

33:51.383 --> 33:53.101
Stay in position.

34:19.078 --> 34:20.911
I'll check the floor.
Okay.

34:42.551 --> 34:44.235
Sorry.

34:54.496 --> 34:55.746
I've got him.

34:55.831 --> 34:57.672
He's walking up the stairs
towards my position.

34:57.732 --> 34:59.784
Approach with caution.
Go on my orders.

35:02.671 --> 35:03.671
Now!

35:08.677 --> 35:09.677
Get the vest off.

35:09.678 --> 35:11.596
Keep his fingers open.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.714
He's clean.
No vest.

35:13.766 --> 35:15.800
What's going on?

35:15.884 --> 35:17.135
We've got to go.

35:17.219 --> 35:18.719
Let's get him to the facility.

35:29.148 --> 35:31.765
Tell us what the plan was,
Mykola.

35:31.817 --> 35:34.268
What were you and your brother
doing with Khalid Ansari?

35:39.708 --> 35:42.543
Talk to me.
Talk to me.

35:42.611 --> 35:44.045
You can save yourself.

35:46.081 --> 35:47.582
Charlie.

35:47.633 --> 35:49.967
I think I just saw Oksana Altan
outside the building.

35:50.052 --> 35:51.785
- The sister?
- Yeah.

35:51.837 --> 35:53.171
Go check it out.
We're moving him.

35:53.255 --> 35:54.505
Okay.

36:22.251 --> 36:23.334
Clear the detention room.

36:23.418 --> 36:25.253
H.I.G. is coming soon.

36:36.098 --> 36:37.098
<i>Spasiba.</i>

36:54.783 --> 36:56.951
What's that?

37:09.665 --> 37:10.665
Stop.

37:17.706 --> 37:18.706
Is that blood?

37:27.566 --> 37:28.566
What the hell?

37:28.567 --> 37:29.934
<i>As-salaam alaikum.</i>

37:43.448 --> 37:44.699
Don't move.

37:44.750 --> 37:46.233
Oksana.

37:46.285 --> 37:48.402
Oksana!

37:55.928 --> 37:57.044
Listen up, everyone.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.582
Here's what we know.

38:01.633 --> 38:04.185
Mykola Altan had
a surgically implanted I.E.D.

38:04.252 --> 38:07.555
We believe the surgery
was done by his sister Oksana.

38:07.606 --> 38:10.090
Oksana was taken down
by Annie Walker,

38:10.142 --> 38:14.395
but their brother Borz Altan
remains in the wind.

38:14.446 --> 38:16.263
The Altans
somehow had knowledge

38:16.315 --> 38:20.934
of our secret Chicago facility
and our detention protocols

38:20.986 --> 38:24.622
in the wake of the false attempt
on the C.B.O.T.

38:24.706 --> 38:26.407
Everyone in the facility

38:26.458 --> 38:28.492
at the time of detonation
has died.

38:33.114 --> 38:38.002
This is a direct attack
on our agency and its people.

38:38.086 --> 38:40.805
It's an attack on all of us,

38:40.889 --> 38:43.424
and we will not stop

38:43.475 --> 38:48.095
until we bring the people
who did this to justice.

40:10.629 --> 40:14.516
I made calls
to all the families.

40:15.121 --> 40:18.207
12 different families learning
that a loved one was dead.

40:20.493 --> 40:23.545
I promised them all
we'd get to the bottom of this.

40:26.883 --> 40:29.218
Any news on Borz?

40:29.302 --> 40:31.369
No.
He's in the wind.

40:31.421 --> 40:34.089
The Altans
did not do this alone.

40:34.173 --> 40:37.593
The inside information,
the planning, the access--

40:37.677 --> 40:40.596
whoever is behind this
knows our playbook.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.547
They knew we would follow down
Khalid Ansari

40:42.599 --> 40:44.399
to Borz Altan
and the C.B.O.T.,

40:44.484 --> 40:47.102
and they knew
we would take Mykola here.

40:47.186 --> 40:48.654
They're a step ahead of us.

40:48.721 --> 40:50.221
They played us.

40:50.273 --> 40:51.907
I want to stay on this,
Calder.

40:51.991 --> 40:55.294
I know you do,
and we need you.

40:55.361 --> 40:59.531
You said
you wanted a mission,

40:59.582 --> 41:00.899
well, now you've got one.

41:03.202 --> 41:04.736
I'll give it everything
I got.

41:12.078 --> 41:13.545
Arthur,
what's going on?

41:13.596 --> 41:15.464
Well,
I thought about your offer.

41:15.548 --> 41:17.132
I'm gonna take you up on it.

41:17.216 --> 41:18.634
Outstanding.

41:18.718 --> 41:20.251
When do I start?

41:20.303 --> 41:22.387
I just have to go out of town,
take care of a few things,

41:22.438 --> 41:23.438
but I should be back Monday.

41:23.523 --> 41:24.523
How's that?

41:24.524 --> 41:26.191
Monday's great.

41:26.258 --> 41:27.442
See you then.
Okay.

41:27.527 --> 41:28.644
Oh, hey, a question--

41:28.728 --> 41:30.028
when you were D.C.S.,

41:30.096 --> 41:32.481
did you work with an operative
named Annie Walker?

41:32.565 --> 41:34.399
I know Annie Walker.
Why?

41:34.450 --> 41:35.600
We'll talk about it Monday.

41:35.652 --> 41:37.035
Thanks for coming on board,
Arthur.

41:37.103 --> 41:39.538
We're gonna kick
some serious ass together.

41:55.287 --> 41:57.389
Auggie.

41:57.456 --> 42:00.125
Annie.

42:00.176 --> 42:01.643
Calder talk to you?

42:01.728 --> 42:04.896
- Yeah, he kept me on this.
- That's good.

42:04.964 --> 42:07.149
I'm sorry about Charlie.

42:09.135 --> 42:10.569
Yeah, me too.

42:18.528 --> 42:21.163
It's a hell of a thing, huh?

42:21.247 --> 42:22.981
I'm just glad
you weren't in there with him.

42:30.373 --> 42:32.374
It's eight months
since I've been in the D.P.D.

42:32.458 --> 42:34.092
It's still your home.

42:35.762 --> 42:36.795
One more thing--

42:36.846 --> 42:38.013
you want to tell me
what happened

42:38.097 --> 42:39.097
the last four months?

42:39.132 --> 42:40.382
Auggie.

42:40.466 --> 42:42.384
You said you wanted to go back
to the way things were,

42:42.468 --> 42:43.719
and a lot of that
is based on trust.

42:43.803 --> 42:45.837
So, if there's something
you want to tell me--

42:45.888 --> 42:48.106
not me and the Agency,

42:48.174 --> 42:50.776
not me and Calder,
just me,

42:50.843 --> 42:54.062
as your handler
and our friend--

42:54.147 --> 42:55.731
no matter what it is,
now's the time.

43:01.404 --> 43:02.404
There's nothing to say.

43:05.658 --> 43:07.959
You can trust me.

43:08.027 --> 43:09.077
I do trust you.

43:10.696 --> 43:12.831
Then let's get to work.
