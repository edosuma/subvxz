12:36.625 --> 12:38.105
I'm gonna try
and catch some Zs.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.020
Oh, yeah, sure.
The jetlag, right?

12:40.063 --> 12:41.456
Yeah.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.470
Do you want the good news
or the bad news first?

12:55.513 --> 12:58.038
Well, we've had quite the run
of bad news today,

12:58.081 --> 12:59.387
so I say let's keep that coming.

12:59.430 --> 13:02.129
Well, as you know,

13:02.172 --> 13:05.219
our victim didn't leave us
with a lot to work with.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.221
I wasn't able to pull prints
or run dental records.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.396
Of course there's DNA,

13:08.439 --> 13:10.528
but, alas, no matches
in the system.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.443
Okay, I think I'm ready
for the good news.

13:12.487 --> 13:13.662
I did notice
something interesting

13:13.705 --> 13:16.752
about his missing feet.
Take a look at this.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.798
You see these striation marks
on the victim's shins?

13:19.973 --> 13:22.584
That tells me that his feet
were ripped off,

13:22.627 --> 13:24.412
not eaten
by marine life.

13:24.455 --> 13:27.067
Something heavy was
weighing this body down,

13:27.110 --> 13:29.286
so when the sand dredger
sucked it up,

13:29.330 --> 13:31.158
sadly, the feet didn't
come along for the ride.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.942
Well, you're right,
that is interesting,

13:32.986 --> 13:35.771
but tell me how that constitutes
good news.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.207
Because I found something
in the left tibia

13:37.251 --> 13:38.774
that could be useful for an ID.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.255
This is our victim's
lower leg.

13:44.649 --> 13:45.737
All right, so check this out,

13:45.781 --> 13:48.001
Noelani found a small
surgical cavity

13:48.044 --> 13:49.611
in the victim's left shin.

13:49.654 --> 13:52.135
She believes it's there
as a result of an orthopedic pin

13:52.179 --> 13:53.702
that was anchored to the ankle.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.269
Now, this is what
the victim's leg

13:55.312 --> 13:58.881
would've looked like before
the sand dredger got to him.

13:58.925 --> 14:01.101
All right, you see the
surgical pin there connecting

14:01.144 --> 14:02.363
the fibula to the ankle bone?

14:02.406 --> 14:04.365
Great, so assuming
that pin is still there,

14:04.408 --> 14:05.845
we remove it
and run the serial number.

14:05.888 --> 14:08.021
Cross reference that against
hospital records,

14:08.064 --> 14:10.980
I think we'll have an excellent
chance of narrowing down an ID.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.242
DANNY:
Just so I'm clear,

14:12.286 --> 14:13.417
we're talking about
finding a pair of feet

14:13.461 --> 14:15.332
at the bottom
of the ocean, right?
Yes.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.813
I guess you can say
the game is afoot.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.511
You could say that if you want
to make a bad joke, sure.

14:20.555 --> 14:21.730
Why do you hate puns?

14:21.773 --> 14:22.992
STEVE: Okay, look,
first things first.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.776
We need to find the driver
of that dump truck.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.778
If we can find out exactly where
that sand was dredged,

14:26.822 --> 14:28.476
maybe we have
at chance of finding

14:28.519 --> 14:30.913
these weighted-down feet.TANI: Well,
not quite, because

14:30.957 --> 14:33.437
the driver got away and there
was no plates on the truck.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.352
Then we're gonna
have to find somebody

14:35.396 --> 14:37.659
who knows who the players are
in the sand game.

14:37.702 --> 14:40.009
Yeah, I, uh, think
we might know somebody.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.188
DANNY: I'm not trying
to be combative here.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.755
I'm just giving
you my opinion.

14:46.798 --> 14:49.323
Okay, well, in this case,
your opinion's wrong, all right?

14:49.366 --> 14:50.977
Duke has has got to go
to that hearing tomorrow.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.282
Why? Why does
he got to go?

14:52.326 --> 14:53.631
If he doesn't go,
does he lose his pension?

14:53.675 --> 14:55.459
No, he doesn't. He keeps
his pension either way.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.287
Okay, so then, so then
why go? Why go?

14:57.331 --> 14:59.550
You don't go, y-y-you get
to keep your money,

14:59.594 --> 15:00.812
you go play Barbies
with your granddaughter

15:00.856 --> 15:02.292
for the rest of your life.
What's the problem?

15:02.336 --> 15:03.424
What's the problem? I'll tell
you what the problem is,

15:03.467 --> 15:04.904
he doesn't get to
be a cop anymore.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.210
Danny, you understand that?
Not to mention,

15:07.254 --> 15:08.385
he doesn't get
to clear his name.

15:08.429 --> 15:09.909
Okay, let's
say he goes,

15:09.952 --> 15:11.258
and it doesn't go the way
he wants it to go.

15:11.301 --> 15:12.259
He doesn't get
to clear his name,

15:12.302 --> 15:13.869
he doesn't get
to be a cop anymore,

15:13.913 --> 15:15.436
his name gets dragged through
the mud. I wouldn't go, either.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.917
Oh, please. You would never
pass up the opportunity to talk.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.483
You know what?
You'd go defend yourself.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.877
The judge would rule in favor
just to get you to shut up

15:21.921 --> 15:25.446
and-and beat it.DANNY: Never get high

15:25.489 --> 15:27.665
on your own supply, babe,
you ever heard of that?

15:27.709 --> 15:30.494
Been on my feet
seven straight hours.

15:30.538 --> 15:31.713
You think I'm gonna walk

15:31.756 --> 15:33.236
somewhere else
to eat?

15:33.280 --> 15:34.846
Speaking of which,

15:34.890 --> 15:36.674
if you're here for the scampi
special, you're out of luck.

15:36.718 --> 15:37.937
This is the last one.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.939
No, not here for the special.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.244
We're here on business.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.943
Well, here's a business tip

15:43.986 --> 15:46.554
for you two new
restaurant owners.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.904
Don't ever, ever bother

15:48.948 --> 15:50.558
a food service
professional

15:50.601 --> 15:52.516
after his lunch
rush hour.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.431
Sorry for
the intrusion.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.520
We were just wondering if you,
uh, happen to know anybody

15:56.564 --> 15:59.915
who moves black market sand?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.439
Why do you assume that I know

16:02.483 --> 16:05.225
every criminal enterprise
on this island?

16:05.268 --> 16:06.443
Is that a real question?

16:08.271 --> 16:11.057
I might know one guy who
used to move in that circle.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.363
Shocking.Could you maybe

16:13.407 --> 16:14.886
put us in contact?

16:14.930 --> 16:17.019
I'll make a call.Okay, thank you.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.107
We appreciate it.

16:18.151 --> 16:20.066
Anything for you, brother.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.376
You guys don't
have to hang around.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.291
I'll get in touch
after I call the guy.

16:28.335 --> 16:29.858
No, it's okay.
We'll stay here.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.905
You gonna make
the call or what?

16:33.949 --> 16:35.603
Oh, you mean now?

16:35.646 --> 16:36.821
Yes, now, please.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.610
Flippa!

16:42.653 --> 16:44.481
What's up?

16:44.525 --> 16:45.743
So I'm flying down Pali

16:45.787 --> 16:47.832
with 20 tons
of Waimanalo's finest

16:47.876 --> 16:49.095
in the back of my truck

16:49.138 --> 16:50.792
and 15 minutes till the boat
leaves the dock.

16:50.835 --> 16:53.055
I got a huge client
in Dubai,

16:53.099 --> 16:54.970
building one of those
fancy skyscrapers,

16:55.014 --> 16:57.059
but why would Dubai need
imported sand, you might ask?

16:57.103 --> 16:59.714
Here's the thing,

16:59.757 --> 17:01.063
desert sand's no good
for making concrete.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.718
It's pure silica,

17:03.761 --> 17:05.459
too fine.This is riveting.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.461
You were the Scarface of sand,
I get it, but can you...

17:07.504 --> 17:09.071
bottom line us,
get to the point?

17:09.115 --> 17:11.117
Word is, when I got out
of the game,

17:11.160 --> 17:12.988
a couple haolestook over.Okay.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.730
Any chance you can put us
in touch with said haoles?

17:20.039 --> 17:21.475

cut you to pieces.

Danny, if he dies,
I got two bodies and no leads.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.183
Well, if you die, I got
three bodies and no partner.

You see?

19:04.534 --> 19:05.970
No, no, no.

Was it worth it?

19:35.957 --> 19:37.001
Huh? You're gonna
have, uh, sand

19:37.045 --> 19:39.090
in a lot of
unpleasant places.

19:39.134 --> 19:43.486
That load of illegal sand you
dumped on the 93 this morning,

19:43.530 --> 19:45.619
you're gonna tell us exactly
where that was dredged from.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.373

the bright side,

20:07.771 --> 20:09.904
you got plenty
of leg room.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.775
I'm not complaining.

20:11.819 --> 20:14.038
I'm just grateful
I got to come along.

20:14.082 --> 20:16.171
What you reading?

20:16.215 --> 20:17.477
I picked it up at the airport.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.652
Did you know
Detective Williams's

20:18.695 --> 20:20.044
former mother-in-law
is, like,

20:20.088 --> 20:21.916
a super successful author?

20:21.959 --> 20:24.005
This one even made The Times
best-seller list.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.441
What's it about?

20:25.485 --> 20:27.878
Uh, it's about a restaurant
publicist in Seattle,

20:27.922 --> 20:31.230
who breaks off her engagement
to travel through Europe,

20:31.273 --> 20:35.146
where she meets this count
who invites her to his castle.

20:35.190 --> 20:37.279
And now that I'm
saying it out loud,

20:37.323 --> 20:39.977
it's pretty stupid.[laughs]

20:40.021 --> 20:44.025
I bought it to just
keep my mind occupied.

20:44.068 --> 20:46.419
Well, I'll tell you the truth,
it's not really working.

20:50.161 --> 20:52.773
You want to talk about it?

20:54.165 --> 20:55.950
All right, man.

21:00.302 --> 21:03.566
Look, anyone you ask

21:03.610 --> 21:07.048
can tell you where
they were on 9/11.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.702
For me, it was
my mom's basement.

21:08.745 --> 21:12.401
My friend Mika called me,
told me to turn on the TV.

21:12.445 --> 21:17.058
I must've watched the news
for 72 hours straight.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.409
I felt so helpless.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.716
I think I was just

21:22.759 --> 21:26.110
desperate to do something that

21:26.154 --> 21:29.200
would make a difference somehow.

21:29.244 --> 21:31.464
I think most people
felt that way.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.424
Yeah, well,
Mika and I got to talking,

21:35.468 --> 21:39.733
and eventually what we
came up with was the best thing

21:39.776 --> 21:41.691
to do would be to enlist,

21:41.735 --> 21:43.911
but when I was at my

21:43.954 --> 21:46.217
recruitment meeting,
something happened.

21:46.261 --> 21:48.350
My chest got tight,
I was short of breath.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.309
I thought I was having
a heart attack.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.311
It got so bad
they called an ambulance.

21:53.703 --> 21:56.315
Turns out it was a panic attack.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.319
The recruiter called me
the next day to check on me,

22:00.362 --> 22:02.364
and I had to tell him the truth.

22:02.408 --> 22:04.410
I felt so ashamed.

22:04.453 --> 22:08.805
He was understanding, but blunt.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.546
He, uh,

22:10.590 --> 22:13.375
told me the service
wasn't for me.

22:13.419 --> 22:16.900
It's true. The service
isn't for everyone,

22:16.944 --> 22:19.947
but there's no shame in that.

22:19.990 --> 22:23.907
Yeah, well, anyway, that's why
I wanted to come along.

22:23.951 --> 22:25.474
I thought, in
some small way,

22:25.518 --> 22:28.521
this could make up for not
having what it takes to enlist.

22:28.564 --> 22:33.830
Jerry, there's a lot of
different ways to be a hero,

22:33.874 --> 22:37.878
and I've-I've seen you do
a lot of brave things.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.967
I'll tell you
what, man,

22:40.010 --> 22:41.795
you sitting right here,
opening up like that

22:41.838 --> 22:43.666
and sharing that with me?

22:43.710 --> 22:46.234
That's brave.

22:46.277 --> 22:48.279
Thanks, man.

22:48.323 --> 22:51.065
That means a lot.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.416
Hey, you know your buddy
that you went

22:54.460 --> 22:55.809
and volunteered with?

22:55.852 --> 22:58.594
Mika?

22:58.638 --> 23:00.509
Was he the one that
was killed in combat?

23:11.955 --> 23:14.523
STEVE: All right, Danny,
this is where the GPS says

23:14.567 --> 23:16.525
the, uh, dredger dropped anchor.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.571
We should do the same, please.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.451
Do me a favor, give me
a hand with this, will you?

23:29.495 --> 23:31.932
Oh, the-the foot detector.
Trusty foot detector.

23:31.975 --> 23:33.629
Oh, yeah? You know what,
you laugh all you want,

23:33.673 --> 23:36.937
but this thing has pretty sweet
imaging, and it's simple enough

23:36.980 --> 23:38.721
for a monkey to operate,
which is great news,

23:38.765 --> 23:41.637
'cause that's what
you're doing today.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.117
Oh.
All right.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.205
[strains]: Oh, wow,
it's very heavy.

23:44.248 --> 23:45.206
Yeah.

23:45.249 --> 23:45.902
Hope I don't drop it
on your foot.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.904
All right.

23:47.948 --> 23:50.254
You ready? One, two, three, go.

23:52.126 --> 23:54.302
All right, Danny, check this
out. It's pretty simple stuff.

23:54.345 --> 23:56.783
This screen shows you
a live underwater feed.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.219
We're looking for, uh, you know.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.003
Feet. I know what
we're looking for.
Yeah.

24:00.047 --> 24:01.396
Feet. There it is.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.877
The foot. The hoof.

24:06.923 --> 24:09.360
So you want to talk
about that thing?

24:09.404 --> 24:10.666
What?

24:11.885 --> 24:13.452
Duke thing.

24:13.495 --> 24:15.758
No, I don't want to talk
about the Duke thing,

24:15.802 --> 24:18.152
'cause there is no Duke thing.
The conversation's over.

24:18.195 --> 24:19.936
Okay?
Right.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.590
All right.

24:26.377 --> 24:27.378
I think we got something.
Come here.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.555
This look like
feet to you?

24:33.776 --> 24:36.039
It's worth a closer look.

24:39.260 --> 24:42.045
All right, raise your right hand
if you can hear me.

24:45.396 --> 24:46.397
Good.

24:57.104 --> 25:00.063
You know, I-I just,
uh, had a thought.

25:00.107 --> 25:02.152
I think we should, uh, discuss
this Duke thing right now,

25:02.196 --> 25:03.937
because you can't talk back.

25:03.980 --> 25:08.898
My opinion is that, uh, you are
putting yourself in his shoes,

25:08.942 --> 25:10.117
which you should never do.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.988
Uh, he, uh, he is not you.

25:12.032 --> 25:15.122
You're making this about you,
and it's not. It's about him.

25:15.165 --> 25:17.603
And you're... you also just
went, you went past it, like,

25:17.646 --> 25:20.083
20 yards. Go back,
to your five o'clock, 20 yards.

25:20.127 --> 25:22.782
The-the point
that I'm trying to make

25:22.825 --> 25:25.219
is that Duke is a grown man.

25:25.262 --> 25:27.569
Okay? And he can make
his own decisions.

25:27.613 --> 25:28.875
All right? Not everybody
wants to be fighting crime

25:28.918 --> 25:30.572
out of a wheelchair, you know?

25:30.616 --> 25:32.531
There's something to be said for
knowing when your time is up

25:32.574 --> 25:35.577
and not fighting it anymore.

25:37.623 --> 25:38.928
Okay, mission accomplished.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.930
Now grab those feet,
and let's get out of here.

25:40.974 --> 25:42.715
Oh, one more thing.

25:42.758 --> 25:44.804
The designer for the restaurant
told me that you don't think

25:44.847 --> 25:46.066
that I should be involved
in the menu design,

25:46.109 --> 25:48.764
which is hurtful,
and, uh, insane,

25:48.808 --> 25:50.853
because I am good
at that kind of stuff.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.420
Uh, I would like to be a part

25:52.463 --> 25:54.596
of picking the typeface,
not the font.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.119
Okay? It is not called the font.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.599
It's called the typeface.
I know that, I'm pretty sure

25:57.643 --> 25:59.383
you do not know that,
which is another reason why

25:59.427 --> 26:03.300
I should be involved in this,
in this, uh, design process.

26:06.652 --> 26:09.176
So what, big mouth,
you got something to say?

26:09.219 --> 26:10.960
Yeah, I got something to say.
I do.

26:11.004 --> 26:12.266
I chose the Tarantella.

26:12.309 --> 26:14.834
Okay? Because
the designer said

26:14.877 --> 26:16.705
that it was an elegant font
for an Italian menu.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.838
Typeface, not a font.

26:18.881 --> 26:20.840
And I disagree.
We got the feet.

26:20.883 --> 26:22.624
Let's go.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.583
Oh, oh, oh, Danny.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.630
Yeah, they don't
really look like

26:28.674 --> 26:30.327
the feet of a six-foot male.

26:30.371 --> 26:31.633
That's 'cause
they're women's feet.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.288
You know what this means, right?

26:35.550 --> 26:36.899
We got a double homicide.

26:43.079 --> 26:45.081
♪

27:07.016 --> 27:09.018
♪

27:31.040 --> 27:35.001
Ready to get going?

27:35.044 --> 27:37.656
My cousin wasn't
the first person I asked.

27:39.788 --> 27:42.835
To escort my body if something
ever happened to me.

27:42.878 --> 27:46.926
I wanted it to be my dad.

27:46.969 --> 27:48.754
But when I asked him,

27:48.797 --> 27:50.494
he said no.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.543
Well, it was probably
just too hard for him

27:55.586 --> 27:58.328
to imagine doing something
like that.

27:58.372 --> 28:01.854
He never wanted me to serve.

28:01.897 --> 28:04.944
Actually, he made
a point of saying

28:04.987 --> 28:07.120
if I was ever killed over there,

28:07.163 --> 28:10.514
he wouldn't even
be at my funeral.

28:12.778 --> 28:15.824
People can say some hurtful
things when they're upset.

28:15.868 --> 28:19.349
I'm sure he was just
afraid of losing you.

28:19.393 --> 28:23.832
He kind of already lost me
at that point, you know?

28:27.662 --> 28:29.490
After I enlisted,

28:29.533 --> 28:33.146
our relationship
was never the same.

28:33.189 --> 28:36.149
You're both still here,
aren't you?

28:37.585 --> 28:39.587
It's never too late
to make things right.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.772
All right. That's all the feet
we got? We don't need more feet?

28:50.816 --> 28:53.601
No, no, no, this is it.

28:54.384 --> 28:55.821
You're just gonna
dig in there like a,

28:55.864 --> 28:57.387
like an animal?

28:57.431 --> 28:59.738
Disgusting.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.435
Just getting all in there, huh?

29:04.481 --> 29:06.135
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.224
One surgical pin.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.487
Only you could refer to food
after doing what you just did.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.925
Let's shoot it, come on.

29:14.578 --> 29:15.710
See that number?

29:15.754 --> 29:16.972
Yeah.

29:19.322 --> 29:22.456
We ran the serial number
on that surgical pin,

29:22.499 --> 29:23.283
and we got a hit.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.719
Our Mr. Potato Head

29:24.763 --> 29:28.027
is Kaimi Alana, 34 years old,
no criminal record.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.115
STEVE:
We're gonna send

29:29.158 --> 29:30.551
this evidence back to the lab.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.292
Hopefully, they can pull
some DNA on our female vic,

29:32.335 --> 29:34.816
get an ID,
but in the meantime, get HPD

29:34.860 --> 29:35.948
and CSU down to that

29:35.991 --> 29:37.166
sand processing facility,
all right?

29:37.210 --> 29:39.212
Make sure they take the dogs.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.388
If both of these bodies
were sucked up by the same

29:41.431 --> 29:43.738
sand dredger, it's possible
her body is still there,

29:43.782 --> 29:45.261
buried under a pile of sand.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.263
Okay, we'll look into Mr. Alana.

29:47.307 --> 29:49.222
Let's see what we
can find. Come on.

29:52.051 --> 29:53.269
Hmm.

29:55.968 --> 29:58.274
Looks like two, three weeks'
worth of mail to me.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.843
[sighs]

30:01.887 --> 30:04.803
Looks like Mr. Alana
lived alone.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.674
Explains why no one
reported him missing.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.023
Yeah. Let's do a sweep.
Why don't you start in here?

30:08.067 --> 30:10.983
I'll check the other rooms.

30:27.695 --> 30:30.263
Tani, come in here
a second, would you?

30:30.306 --> 30:35.442
Nothing of mention in the
first room, but in here,

30:35.485 --> 30:38.619
he got a whole closet
full of women's clothing.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.360
He got hats and jewelry here,

30:40.403 --> 30:43.232
and in that bathroom,
there's a pile of makeup

30:43.276 --> 30:47.019
and your garden variety of your
ladies' lotions and potions.

30:47.062 --> 30:48.107
Doesn't seem like
much of anything

30:48.150 --> 30:50.065
belong to Mr. Alana here.

30:50.109 --> 30:51.371
Maybe he was subletting
to a woman.

30:51.414 --> 30:54.853
Right, but it's only his name
on all the mail.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.506
Right.

30:57.986 --> 30:59.596
Look at this.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.685
Hold on.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.607
So this looks like

31:10.651 --> 31:12.566
an old graduation photo.

31:12.609 --> 31:15.525
But now, look at the
more recent photos.

31:16.918 --> 31:19.921
Wait a second.

31:19.965 --> 31:22.141
It's both the same person.Mm-hmm.

31:22.184 --> 31:25.448
Okay, looks like our vic
was transgender.

31:25.492 --> 31:28.712
Well, not transgender, but mahu.

31:28.756 --> 31:29.626
Mahu?What's that?

31:29.670 --> 31:30.932
In traditional Hawaiian culture,

31:30.976 --> 31:32.455
mahuare people who identify

31:32.499 --> 31:34.283
with both male
and female spirits.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.851
Gender is fluid.
So whatever that means to you,

31:36.895 --> 31:38.461
that's cool with us.

31:38.505 --> 31:40.681
In this case, it looks
like our vic presented

31:40.724 --> 31:43.162
as traditionally female.Well, the fact

31:43.205 --> 31:44.903
that she was mahuprobably
doesn't have anything to do

31:44.946 --> 31:46.339
with why she was murdered,
but, um...

31:47.688 --> 31:49.733
...what if it did?

31:52.301 --> 31:55.391
Kaimi and I have taught dance
together here for about...

31:55.435 --> 31:58.481
uh, three years now.

31:58.525 --> 32:01.310
When was the last time you
were in contact with her?

32:01.354 --> 32:04.052
Couple weeks ago.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.967
Uh, at the recital.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.403
And she hadn't returned
to work since?

32:07.447 --> 32:10.624
Uh, no, the school
shuts down for a few weeks

32:10.667 --> 32:12.104
after the fall recital.
I'm just here

32:12.147 --> 32:13.975
doing some bookkeeping. Um...

32:14.019 --> 32:15.629
Kaimi mentioned wanting

32:15.672 --> 32:16.935
to take a vacation.

32:16.978 --> 32:19.328
I just thought
that's where she was.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.677
Was she on the outs

32:20.721 --> 32:21.678
with anyone?

32:21.722 --> 32:22.853
I mean, in her personal life

32:22.897 --> 32:23.985
or even here at the studio?

32:24.029 --> 32:27.641
No, uh, Kaimi didn't have
any drama.

32:27.684 --> 32:29.121
The students and parents,

32:29.164 --> 32:30.731
they loved her.

32:31.775 --> 32:34.822
Everyone's gonna be devastated.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.519
Malie, I'm sorry, but we are
going to have to consider

32:36.563 --> 32:38.957
the possibility
of this being a hate crime,

32:39.000 --> 32:40.915
so are you aware of anyone

32:40.959 --> 32:43.309
who may have possibly had
some sort of a problem

32:43.352 --> 32:44.919
with Kaimi or her lifestyle?

32:44.963 --> 32:46.094
It's not a lifestyle.

32:46.138 --> 32:48.314
It's who she was.

32:48.357 --> 32:50.620
I can't speak for Kaimi,

32:50.664 --> 32:52.361
but I personally
have never experienced

32:52.405 --> 32:54.363
any kind of discrimination

32:54.407 --> 32:56.322
here in Hawaii.
I did live

32:56.365 --> 32:57.801
briefly on the mainland,

32:57.845 --> 32:59.978
and the attitude there
was definitely different.

33:00.021 --> 33:03.677
But here...
no one gives us any issues.

33:03.720 --> 33:06.332
Thank you so much
for your time, Malie.

33:06.375 --> 33:08.638
And again, we're
sorry for your loss.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.553
We'll reach out
if we hear anything.

33:10.597 --> 33:11.598
Thank you.

33:14.383 --> 33:17.343
I'm not buying
the whole hate crime thing.

33:17.386 --> 33:21.869
I mean, mahuare very
respected and revered.

33:21.912 --> 33:24.393
How then do you suppose
our victim ended up

33:24.437 --> 33:25.699
at the bottom of the ocean?

33:31.879 --> 33:34.577
[dog barking]

33:34.621 --> 33:36.840
We got something over here.

33:52.204 --> 33:53.770
[cell phone rings]Noelani, what's up?

33:53.814 --> 33:55.033
NOELANI: We found
the second victim's body.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.425
Okay. We get an ID?

33:56.469 --> 33:58.471
I did and you're never
gonna believe this.

33:58.514 --> 34:00.299
Her name is Kaimi Alana.

34:02.344 --> 34:04.433
I'm sorry. Did you just say
that both our victims

34:04.477 --> 34:06.305
have exactly the same name?

34:06.348 --> 34:07.480
Yes.

34:07.523 --> 34:09.612
What do you think?
Some-some wacko's,

34:09.656 --> 34:12.050
uh, going after people
with that name?

34:12.093 --> 34:14.095
Either that or it's a case
of mistaken identity.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.358
Right. All right.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.404
So if a killer makes a mistake,
he kills the wrong person

34:18.447 --> 34:19.709
and then corrects their mistake.

34:19.753 --> 34:21.189
All right, whatever the case,

34:21.233 --> 34:23.322
we need to figure out which one
was the intended target.

34:28.631 --> 34:29.806
Prepare yourself for
the worst, you know,

34:29.850 --> 34:33.723
but it's still a shock.

34:33.767 --> 34:35.856
Can't believe Kaimi's gone.

34:35.899 --> 34:37.423
Yeah. Uh, listen,

34:37.466 --> 34:40.339
we're-we're very sorry
for your loss, Mr. Alana.

34:40.382 --> 34:41.557
Listen, if it's
okay with you,

34:41.601 --> 34:43.124
we need to ask you
a couple of questions.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.387
Yeah, of course.
Anything I can do to help.

34:45.431 --> 34:46.823
DANNY:
When you reported

34:46.867 --> 34:48.782
your wife missing,
you were out of town.

34:48.825 --> 34:50.914
Right?
That's right.

34:50.958 --> 34:54.744
Right. That's, uh,
that's a little suspect.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.790
Excuse me?
STEVE: Mr. Alana,
do you know

34:56.833 --> 34:58.313
Hailey Adams?

34:58.357 --> 35:00.141
Yes, of course.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.535
She's my wife's friend.

35:02.578 --> 35:04.406
So, she just recently
booked a trip to Bali.

35:04.450 --> 35:06.408
It was a first-class trip,
very fancy trip.

35:06.452 --> 35:09.150
And according to the airline,
you were supposed

35:09.194 --> 35:10.934
to be on that flight
with her.

35:10.978 --> 35:12.545
I didn't mean
to ruin the surprise.

35:12.588 --> 35:13.720
I hate surprises.

35:13.763 --> 35:16.026
I don't get it.
Why would

35:16.070 --> 35:18.420
your recently deceased wife's

35:18.464 --> 35:19.508
very close friend

35:19.552 --> 35:20.988
book what seems
to be a romantic trip

35:21.031 --> 35:22.990
for the two of you?

35:23.033 --> 35:26.950
I have no idea why Hailey
would do something like that.

35:26.994 --> 35:29.127
Okay, uh, no,

35:29.170 --> 35:30.389
I'm gonna just
ask you flat out:

35:30.432 --> 35:33.000
did you arrange
to have your wife murdered?

35:33.043 --> 35:36.177
I want a lawyer.
STEVE: Good.
You need a lawyer.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.918

35:37.961 --> 35:40.529
the deal that you think
you're gonna cut, it's too late.

to employ

to my daughter earlier.

36:35.367 --> 36:36.716

she caught Akela

36:36.759 --> 36:38.283

36:38.326 --> 36:40.502
That doesn't sound like Akela.

36:40.546 --> 36:42.025
That's what I thought,

36:42.069 --> 36:44.158
until she explained
why she did it.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.900
It was for a friend in school.

about something that you said,

to my hearing tomorrow.

Well, what I didn't tell you is
I'm the reason he joined up.
