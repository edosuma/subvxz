00:03.103 --> 00:05.197
<i>Abby: Hello, Dan.
Dan: Hey.</i>

00:05.271 --> 00:06.830
-- <i>How are you?</i>
-- <i>Good.</i>

00:06.906 --> 00:09.170
<i>Do you want
to close the door?</i>

00:09.242 --> 00:10.937
Actually, I don't think we need

00:11.011 --> 00:12.342
to have a session today.

00:12.412 --> 00:13.345
Okay.

00:13.413 --> 00:14.972
-- Seriously.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

00:15.048 --> 00:16.641
I'm not saying
we're done completely.

00:16.716 --> 00:18.650
I just don't think we need
to have a session this week.

00:18.718 --> 00:19.685
Okay.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.517
All right, then.
I'm just gonna go.

00:21.588 --> 00:22.384
Okay.

00:22.455 --> 00:23.616
And I'll see you next week.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.124
Sounds good.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.955
-- <i>Seriously.</i>
-- <i>What time you got there?</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:29.826
<i>Announcer: I don't believe it!
29 feet, 8 1/4?!</i>

00:29.896 --> 00:31.261
-- Hmm? -- <i>I said
what time you got?</i>

00:31.331 --> 00:32.491
29, 8 1/4.

00:32.564 --> 00:33.464
Huh?

00:33.533 --> 00:34.466
I'm sorry.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.128
Um...5 after 10:00.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.102
Shouldn't we get started?

00:38.171 --> 00:40.606
No. I'm not kidding.

00:40.673 --> 00:43.370
-- Okay. -- <i>I don't know why you don't
ever believe me when I say I'm happy.</i>

00:43.443 --> 00:45.275
What's 29, 8 1/4?

00:45.345 --> 00:46.710
Nothin'.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.509
[Cheering]

00:48.581 --> 00:50.743
It's a thing that
happened last night.

00:50.817 --> 00:52.285
What?

00:52.352 --> 00:54.377
Believe it or not, Abby,
I'm not allowed to tell you.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.548
-- You're not allowed to tell me?
By law? -- <i>Nope.</i>

00:56.623 --> 00:59.923
It involves the result of a sporting
event that was tape-delayed --

00:59.993 --> 01:02.155
happenedin the middle of last
night in Auckland, New Zealand,

01:02.228 --> 01:03.957
and my network's airing it
tonight in prime time,

01:04.030 --> 01:05.862
-- <i>and they get</i> a <i>little touchy about it.</i>
-- I <i>get it.</i>

01:05.932 --> 01:07.991
You know, it was the same thing in
Nagano, Japan, so you know how it is.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.763
You want to close the door
and sit down?

01:09.836 --> 01:12.168
Nah. I'm, uh,
I'm gonna head to the office.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.797
-- Okay. -- <i>You know, the
interesting thing is</i>

01:13.873 --> 01:15.136
that at the beginning
of the week,

01:15.208 --> 01:17.199
I really couldn't have cared
less about this story.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.678
<i>I normally don't get that
excited about track and field.</i>

01:19.746 --> 01:21.680
I mean, I admire
the athleticism and everything,

01:21.748 --> 01:23.512
but, for me, there needs
to be an opponent.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.347
You seem to get excited
about it on TV.

01:26.986 --> 01:28.351
Well, that's my job.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.549
When it's showtime,
it's showtime.

01:30.623 --> 01:31.556
Roll VTR.

01:31.624 --> 01:32.750
60 seconds live.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.453
Stand by, four,
five, and six.

01:34.527 --> 01:36.017
<i>Dave: Stand by, animation.
-- Where's Dan'?</i>

01:36.096 --> 01:37.894
Danny! Showtime!

01:37.964 --> 01:39.056
Jeremy, let's go.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.691
Yeah, I'll be right there.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.735
Computerized voice:
Welcome.

01:44.504 --> 01:47.235
-- Preview Denver. Uh, get me Brett in I.A.
I/VIH: Denver's up.

01:47.307 --> 01:49.867
-- Jeremy, what's in that computer
you're waiting for? -- Huh?

01:49.943 --> 01:52.002
-- You've been checking your e-mail
all day. -- Chris, show me Auckland.

01:52.078 --> 01:54.012
-- I'm waiting for a letter
from my sister. -- Okay.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.514
-- <i>30 seconds live.</i>
-- <i>Auckland's up.</i>

01:55.582 --> 01:56.708
Can you hear me, Oscar?

01:56.783 --> 01:58.581
-- <i>Is that Natalie?</i>
-- <i>It's Natalie stateside.</i>

01:58.651 --> 01:59.516
How you doin'?

01:59.586 --> 02:01.554
-- <i>I'm</i> doing <i>okay.</i>
-- <i>Just okay?</i>

02:01.621 --> 02:03.953
-- <i>I'm</i> a <i>little nervous.</i> -- <i>You
jump better than you talk?</i>

02:04.023 --> 02:06.117
I do almost everything
better than I talk, Natalie.

02:06.192 --> 02:09.127
One of these days, you're gonna have to
come up here and prove that to me, Oscar.

02:09.195 --> 02:11.425
10 seconds live.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.125
You really can't get
excited about this?

02:13.199 --> 02:14.860
A guy jumping far
into a pit of sand?

02:14.968 --> 02:17.266
-- Ah, he's gonna set a new world
record, you know -- -- Okay.

02:17.337 --> 02:20.307
-- 29' 5", if I'm any judge in the
art of the long jump. -- You're not.

02:20.373 --> 02:22.637
<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

02:22.709 --> 02:24.905
Good evening.
From New York City,

02:24.978 --> 02:27.504
I'm Dan Rydell
alongside Casey McCall.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.570
Those stories,

02:28.648 --> 02:30.810
plus the T-wolves
go hunting in Motor City,

02:30.884 --> 02:32.784
the Sharks get jiggy
in San Jose,

02:32.852 --> 02:35.446
and, yes, we've got a Shaq
attack in Hackensack.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.718
We'll take you
to Auckland, New Zealand,

02:37.790 --> 02:39.485
where Oscar Parrish is poised

02:39.559 --> 02:41.459
to demonstrate
that what jumps up

02:41.528 --> 02:43.963
may not come down
for an awfully long time.

02:44.030 --> 02:47.295
You're watching “Sports Night“ on CSC.
Stick around.

02:47.367 --> 02:48.835
<i>Dave." We're out.</i>

02:53.773 --> 02:55.104
<i>Now, Oscar,</i>

02:55.175 --> 02:56.973
you've had a decade's worth
of bad luck.

02:57.043 --> 02:58.772
You were set to win
the gold medal

02:58.845 --> 03:00.711
at the world championships
in Berlin,

03:00.780 --> 03:02.544
<i>and you tore an ACL
in the preliminaries.</i>

03:02.615 --> 03:05.880
We all knew you were gonna
break the record in Atlanta,

03:05.952 --> 03:09.013
and, of course, the death of your
father on the eve of the games

03:09.088 --> 03:10.988
kept you
out of the competition.

03:11.057 --> 03:12.889
So let me ask you
a stupid question --

03:12.959 --> 03:14.449
how much does all that add
to the pressure on you?

03:14.527 --> 03:15.858
<i>Oscar: Well, there's plenty
of pressure.</i>

03:15.929 --> 03:17.920
<i>You know, all I've done
since I was 14 years old</i>

03:17.997 --> 03:19.465
is try to jump
a quarter-inch farther.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.001
I'm 33 now, and my legs stopped
getting stronger a few years ago.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.696
Is it fair to say this is your
last chance to set a record?

03:24.771 --> 03:26.432
Yeah, this is the ballgame.

03:26.506 --> 03:28.201
You've got a lot of people
here rooting for you, Oscar.

03:28.274 --> 03:30.299
Go strap those wings on
your feet and knock us dead.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.901
I'll do my best.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.743
Oscar Parrish
from the Millennial Games.

03:34.814 --> 03:36.407
A reminder from
our promo department --

03:36.482 --> 03:38.177
you can catch
all the action from Auckland

03:38.251 --> 03:42.347
during CSCTs prime-time coverage of the
Millennial Games, live on tape delay --

03:42.422 --> 03:45.858
I swear to God it says that -- “live on
tape delay“ -- tomorrow night at 8:00.

03:45.925 --> 03:49.520
We'll be back and better than ever
with all the highlights at 11 :00.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.291
For Casey McCall,
I'm Dan Rydell.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.458
You've been watching
"Sports Night" on CSC.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.297
-- We'll see you tomorrow.
-- Good night.

03:55.368 --> 03:56.631
<i>I actually know this one.</i>

03:56.703 --> 03:58.364
Mike Powell's got
the long-jump record.

03:58.438 --> 04:01.305
-- <i>29</i> feet, 4 <i>inches.</i>
-- <i>You're not impressed?</i>

04:01.374 --> 04:02.842
-- Do you know whose record he broke?
-- No.

04:02.909 --> 04:03.842
Then I'm not impressed.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.402
<i>So the world has to wait till tonight
to find out if your guy did it?</i>

04:06.479 --> 04:07.537
-- Oscar Parrish.
-- Yeah.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.275
Not the whole world,
just this half of it.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.909
-- You already know.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

04:11.985 --> 04:14.420
-- You get it by Teletype.
-- Teletype?

04:14.487 --> 04:16.956
-- That's not what they call it? -- That's
what they called <i>it</i> in Citizen Kane,

04:17.023 --> 04:20.185
but there's been significant communications
technology progress since then.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.728
We have
live satellite feeds now.

04:21.793 --> 04:22.989
Weren't you leaving?

04:23.062 --> 04:24.427
Yeah.

04:24.497 --> 04:25.464
'Cause you're feeling good.

04:25.531 --> 04:26.828
Believe me,
don't believe me.

04:26.899 --> 04:28.162
Okay.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.066
<i>You know, we're having a
perfectly fun conversation,</i>

04:30.136 --> 04:31.831
you gotta go and put
your stethoscope on.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.167
The meter's running.

04:33.239 --> 04:34.798
No, the meter's not running.
This wasn't an appointment.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.842
24 hours notice, Danny.
I gotta earn a living.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.310
-- <i>Well, that's</i> a <i>bit of</i> a <i>turnoff.</i>
-- <i>Believe me when I teH you</i>

04:39.379 --> 04:41.746
the last thing I'm trying
to do is turn you on.

04:41.814 --> 04:44.340
-- VVell, change whatever it is you're
doing 'cause -- -- I'M see you next week.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.907
Say, speaking of being turned on
-- this'll take just a second

04:45.985 --> 04:47.180
<i>since you know
the cast of characters.</i>

04:47.253 --> 04:49.722
Jeremy's in love
with an adult-film actress.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.585
A porn star?

04:50.657 --> 04:52.125
I believe they prefer

04:52.191 --> 04:54.660
to be called
"adult-film actress."

04:54.727 --> 04:56.923
You think it's his reaction
to his breakup with Natalie?

04:56.996 --> 04:59.090
It's Jeremy
and a porn star, Abby.

04:59.165 --> 05:01.361
Of course it's a reaction
to his breakup with Natalie.

05:01.434 --> 05:02.492
L-I'm interested in this.

05:02.568 --> 05:04.263
If I hadn't gone
to medical school,

05:04.337 --> 05:06.135
I was thinking
of being a porn star.

05:08.007 --> 05:09.441
How long they been dating?

05:09.509 --> 05:11.944
It's not entirely clear whether
or not they are dating.

05:12.011 --> 05:15.037
Last time I saw Jeremy, he was
heading out into a rainstorm.

05:15.114 --> 05:16.878
-- Kim, come on.
-- No.

05:16.949 --> 05:18.007
Kimberly.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.882
Track and field
at 2:00 in the morning?

05:19.952 --> 05:21.317
Elliot, where's your spirit?

05:21.387 --> 05:23.879
It goes home with me at midnight
when I'm done with work.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.583
-- I'll order food.
-- What kind of food?

05:25.658 --> 05:27.126
What kind of food
do you want?

05:27.193 --> 05:28.558
-- Mexican.
-- Mexican it is.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.892
-- And Chinese. I like to mix them.
-- What the hell?

05:30.963 --> 05:33.762
Okey-doke. Elliot, there's gonna
be Mexican food and Chinese food.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.392
I'm kind of in the mood
for deli.

05:35.468 --> 05:37.960
Mexican food, Chinese food,
and food from a delicatessen.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.198
-- I'm there.
-- Outstanding.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.899
-- Jeremy.
-- Morning.

05:40.973 --> 05:44.068
I am organizing a late-night posse
to watch Oscar break the record.

05:44.143 --> 05:45.201
What kind of food?

05:45.278 --> 05:46.768
You know, I'm getting
kind of tired

05:46.846 --> 05:48.336
of having to bribe people
with food.

05:48.414 --> 05:50.007
-- I'm not doing that anymore.
-- Pizza.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.380
-- You got it.
-- Thank you.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.715
-- What's with the umbrella?
-- It's gonna rain tonight.

05:53.786 --> 05:56.016
-- No, it's not.
-- It really is.

05:56.089 --> 05:59.286
No, QXR said overnight lows in the 50s and
less than 10°/o chance of precipitation.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.624
No, this time of year, there's a low-pressure
system that moves down from Newfoundland.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.187
<i>Ordinarily, it moves out to sea
once it hits Northern New England,</i>

06:05.264 --> 06:07.255
but there's a particularly
unusual Atlantic cold front

06:07.333 --> 06:08.926
that's gonna keep it
coastally contained.

06:09.001 --> 06:10.435
Computerized voice:
Welcome.

06:10.503 --> 06:13.438
-- So you're saying it's
gonna rain tonight? -- Yeah.

06:13.506 --> 06:15.270
Good to know.

06:15.341 --> 06:16.365
Damn.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.876
<i>Dana: Why don't I go
to church?</i>

06:17.944 --> 06:18.877
Yeah.

06:18.945 --> 06:21.380
I don't know.
I never have.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.108
You used to.

06:23.182 --> 06:25.776
VVell, once in a while, when I was a kid.
Why are you asking me?

06:25.852 --> 06:26.944
I don't know.

06:27.019 --> 06:28.714
I've just always thought
you'd like it.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.951
Am I in need of something?

06:32.024 --> 06:33.321
I was just asking.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.487
I'm totally -- I mean --

06:35.561 --> 06:37.495
I have absolutely
nothing to say.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.497
Then I'll just
count my blessings.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.862
I have work to do now.

06:40.967 --> 06:41.991
Okay.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.002
And what with being
spiritually bereft --

06:44.070 --> 06:46.334
<i>I just brought it up.</i>

06:46.406 --> 06:48.898
I'm a hot, young,
single woman in New York.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.000
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

06:51.077 --> 06:53.842
I don't know,
but there's relevancy there.

06:53.913 --> 06:54.641
Okay.

06:54.714 --> 06:55.909
[Knock on door]
Excuse me.

06:55.982 --> 06:56.881
Come on in.

06:56.949 --> 06:58.439
I have to get back to work.

06:58.518 --> 06:59.280
Okay.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.024
What's on your mind,
Jeremy?

07:06.092 --> 07:07.491
Oh, quite a bit, actually.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.892
Then is it too late for me
to take back my question?

07:09.962 --> 07:12.431
I think I'm in love
with this girl.

07:12.498 --> 07:16.093
No, obviously, love's too
strong, but I met this girl.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.694
Is she in any way
related to me?

07:17.770 --> 07:19.295
-- No.
-- Then we're fine.

07:23.042 --> 07:25.306
She's an adult-film
actress.

07:26.746 --> 07:29.306
A porn star?

07:29.382 --> 07:32.317
I think they prefer
"adult-film actress."

07:32.385 --> 07:34.615
[Chuckles]
How'd you meet her?

07:34.687 --> 07:37.884
I met her the other night when she
started talking to me at Anthony's.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.322
We were talking
for a couple hours,

07:39.392 --> 07:41.793
but then I kind of blew her off
when I found out what she did.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.387
Then I got to the office the next
day, and I e-mailed her website.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.592
-- She has a website?
Yeah.

07:46.666 --> 07:50.933
VVell, I'm not that wild about e-mail traffic
from porn stars coming to the office.

07:51.003 --> 07:53.472
I set up a special address. She's
the only one that can hit it.

07:53.539 --> 07:56.474
But it's been three days since I sent
it, and I haven't heard back from her.

07:56.542 --> 07:59.341
By the way, if you ever want to
do it, use a server in Finland.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.540
It stores the return address
in an encrypted file,

08:01.614 --> 08:04.640
sends the message to the recipient
with an address from the remailer.

08:04.717 --> 08:07.345
Does the porn star know
you're this much of a dork?

08:07.420 --> 08:09.047
I don't think she does.

08:09.121 --> 08:13.718
But my question was... am I crazy
for thinking about her this much?

08:13.793 --> 08:15.192
-- Jeremy...
-- Yeah?

08:15.261 --> 08:18.390
You're reacting to your
breakup with Natalie,

08:18.464 --> 08:19.863
and you're romanticizing

08:19.932 --> 08:22.060
the time you spent
with this girl.

08:22.134 --> 08:23.067
Yes.

08:23.135 --> 08:24.569
That's what I'm doing.

08:24.637 --> 08:25.729
It's natural.

08:25.805 --> 08:27.500
Yeah.

08:27.573 --> 08:28.506
Okay, thanks.

08:28.574 --> 08:31.407
Are the Rangers
playing tonight?

08:31.477 --> 08:32.967
They're in Detroit.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.572
-- Danny...
-- Dana.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.116
The network would
like me to remind you

08:37.183 --> 08:38.616
that you've signed
nondisclosure forms

08:38.683 --> 08:40.152
with regard
to tape-delayed broadcasts.

08:40.219 --> 08:41.880
It's not like that
information's hard to get.

08:41.953 --> 08:43.717
-- They asked me to remind you.
-- To say nothing if

08:43.789 --> 08:46.224
I don't think rumors about a
long-jump competition in New Zealand

08:46.292 --> 08:47.953
-- are gonna spread like wildfire.
-- Whatever.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.461
Jeremy, rundown.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.088
I'll be right there.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.727
Computerized voice:
Welcome.

08:53.799 --> 08:54.925
You've got mail.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.065
<i>Abby: I want to write this down.
Dan: Why?</i>

09:03.142 --> 09:04.974
'Cause I'm gonna watch
the tape delay later,

09:05.044 --> 09:06.569
and I want to know
all the numbers.

09:06.646 --> 09:07.943
So Mike Powell
was 29 feet --

09:08.014 --> 09:09.607
Bob Beamon
was 29 feet, 2 1/2.

09:09.682 --> 09:12.276
Mike Powell broke his record
at 29 feet, 4 1/4 inches.

09:12.351 --> 09:15.150
Wow, just an inch and 3/4.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.121
An inch and 3/4 is 100 miles
in track and field.

09:17.189 --> 09:20.489
<i>The distance is always 100 miles
between first place and second place.</i>

09:20.560 --> 09:23.257
<i>You know, Jackie Robinson had a
brother, and he ran the 200 meters.</i>

09:23.329 --> 09:25.093
At the Olympics, he ran it
faster than anyone

09:25.164 --> 09:27.132
had ever run it before,
and he still came in second.

09:27.199 --> 09:29.531
I didn't know Jackie Robinson
had a brother.

09:29.602 --> 09:30.967
'Cause it was
the 1936 Olympics,

09:31.037 --> 09:32.903
and the guy who came in first
was Jesse Owens.

09:32.972 --> 09:36.408
Yeah, I was talking to a friend
of mine who's a sports fan,

09:36.475 --> 09:40.036
and he said there was a magazine
that did a top 100 list

09:40.112 --> 09:42.843
of the most influential
people in sports,

09:42.915 --> 09:44.974
and he thought
it was strange

09:45.051 --> 09:47.748
that, uh, Casey made the list
and you didn't.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.515
-- Why would your friend bring that up?
-- He <i>just did.</i>

09:49.589 --> 09:51.318
<i>Seems like the only reason
he would bring that up</i>

09:51.390 --> 09:53.916
is if he knew I was
a patient of yours.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.461
He doesn't.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.962
Anyway, my point is

09:57.029 --> 09:59.430
an inch is forever
in track and field.

09:59.498 --> 10:03.526
<i>So 29 feet, 4 1/4 inches
is the mark to beat?</i>

10:03.603 --> 10:05.071
Yeah.

10:05.137 --> 10:06.901
Food of many lands --

10:06.973 --> 10:09.908
Mexico, China, Italy,
your own nation of Israel.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.102
It's track and field.

10:11.177 --> 10:13.168
Yeah, but it's the camaraderie
I'm talking about.

10:13.245 --> 10:14.906
You know, I've never been
to Israel.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.245
[Snaps fingers] That is why I am
bringing Israel to you, my friend,

10:17.316 --> 10:18.943
with fine smoked meats
and cheeses.

10:19.018 --> 10:20.952
Yeah, meat and dairy
is just what you want

10:21.020 --> 10:23.079
on the same plate
for that touch of Jerusalem.

10:23.155 --> 10:24.645
Hey, come on.
I don't think so.

10:24.724 --> 10:25.714
-- Danny.
-- Casey.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.384
Danny! You know,
I think that there's

10:27.460 --> 10:29.224
a residual "top 100 list"
thing going on.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.421
There isn't.

10:30.496 --> 10:32.726
You've been like this
for, like, a week now.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.197
-- Casey, there isn't.
-- Okay.

10:34.266 --> 10:37.201
I'm just going to go grab some
menus if you change your mind.

10:37.269 --> 10:38.703
Computerized voice:
Welcome.

10:38.771 --> 10:41.263
[Thunder crashes]

10:41.340 --> 10:43.274
Jeremy, what is going on
with you and e-mail?

10:43.342 --> 10:46.437
Someone e-mailed me that they want to
meet me at a certain place tonight,

10:46.512 --> 10:48.310
and I e-mailed them
that I'm not gonna go,

10:48.381 --> 10:50.645
and I can see that they
haven't opened the e-mail yet.

10:50.716 --> 10:52.343
So she's just gonna be
sitting there.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.443
-- She? Who's she?
-- Yeah. You don't know her.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.147
-- What's her name?
-- Her name's Jenny.

10:56.222 --> 10:57.417
-- <i>Jenny</i> who?
-- I don't know her last name.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.185
She gave you her e-mail address,
but not her last name?

10:59.258 --> 11:01.022
-- Are we done with 20 questions?
-- I'm just askin'.

11:01.093 --> 11:04.188
-- She works under a different name.
-- What, <i>is</i> she a <i>porn</i> star?

11:04.263 --> 11:07.893
They prefer
"adult-film actress."

11:08.000 --> 11:09.900
Oh, man.

11:09.969 --> 11:11.698
[Thunder rumbling]

11:11.771 --> 11:13.330
<i>Oh.</i>

11:13.406 --> 11:15.067
I don't know why
I reacted that way.

11:15.141 --> 11:16.472
You were jealous.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.534
-- Of Jeremy?
-- Yeah.

11:24.450 --> 11:28.216
It rained really hard
last night.

11:28.287 --> 11:29.345
Where are you going?

11:29.422 --> 11:30.890
I gotta go tell somebody
I'm not gonna meet them.

11:30.956 --> 11:32.287
<i>-- You comm' back'?
-- Yep.</i>

11:32.358 --> 11:34.759
-- Hey, you were right about the rain.
-- Yep.

11:34.827 --> 11:35.988
Ah, where are you going?

11:36.062 --> 11:37.552
-- I'm running to the ATM.
-- Why?

11:37.630 --> 11:38.825
I need cash.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.798
-- For what?
-- It's for general use.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.836
-- It's for betting with Natalie.
-- Yeah.

11:43.903 --> 11:46.600
-- You're gonna bet on
track and field. -- Yes.

11:46.672 --> 11:48.697
You know, the two of you need to get
yourselves in a meeting, you know that?

11:48.774 --> 11:51.175
She gave me 8 to 5
on Heinrich in the pole vault.

11:51.243 --> 11:52.904
-- Seriously?
-- Back in a minute.

11:52.978 --> 11:54.309
Oh, hey!

11:54.380 --> 11:55.711
Oh.

11:55.781 --> 11:57.545
Hey, ho!

11:57.616 --> 11:59.516
Since you're going out
in the rainstorm anyway,

11:59.585 --> 12:01.952
[Thunder crashes]
feel like picking up the food?

12:02.021 --> 12:02.954
From where?

12:03.022 --> 12:04.956
-- The following six
places -- -- Casey...

12:05.024 --> 12:06.685
-- Come on!
-- I'm not going to six places.

12:06.759 --> 12:09.126
-- They're all across the street from
each other. -- Have it delivered.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.720
No, it'll take forever,
and I'm starving.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.855
Remember the job I did for you
when you had the flu?

12:12.932 --> 12:14.161
-- Write them down for me.
-- Ah!

12:14.233 --> 12:15.359
[Thunder rumbling]

12:17.770 --> 12:18.896
-- Hi.
-- Hi.

12:18.971 --> 12:21.235
-- Oh, I'm, uh, wet.
-- Yes.

12:21.307 --> 12:24.242
-- You're not.
-- I took an umbrella.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.904
-- Who knew it was gonna rain?
-- You should've asked me.

12:26.979 --> 12:30.210
Um, I was really glad
to get your e-mail.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.774
And I was glad you wrote me
back, but then I sent you --

12:32.852 --> 12:34.411
Would you hang on?
Hey, Jack...

12:34.487 --> 12:37.013
-- could I get a rum and Coke
and a cup of hot tea? -- Yeah.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.114
You sent me another what?

12:39.191 --> 12:41.216
I sent you another e-mail.

12:41.293 --> 12:44.319
Jack, why don't you
hold off on that?

12:44.396 --> 12:47.832
Look, I don't mind sitting here and having
a drink with you. I mean, that's fine.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.834
But just so you know, there's not
gonna be any kind of relationship.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.870
You don't mind sitting here
having a drink with me?

12:51.937 --> 12:53.803
-- God, I'm walking on air.
-- Jenny...

12:53.873 --> 12:56.706
-- Why did you make me come down
here tonight? -- I sent you --

12:56.776 --> 12:58.676
Come to think of it, why did
you come down here tonight if,

12:58.744 --> 13:00.269
as you say,
you sent me an e-mail?

13:00.346 --> 13:01.814
-- I did send you an e-mail.
-- Not that I got.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.610
Jenny, check your e-mail.
There will be one from me, okay?

13:03.682 --> 13:04.740
I don't want to argue
about that.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.342
What you said a second ago,

13:06.418 --> 13:07.579
about wanting
to make it clear right off

13:07.653 --> 13:08.848
that there's not gonna be
a relationship,

13:08.921 --> 13:10.787
and the fact that we're both
here right now anyway --

13:10.856 --> 13:12.517
what I'm saying,
it sounds a lot to me like,

13:12.591 --> 13:15.083
“What I'd really like to do is get drunk
with a porn star, go back to her place,

13:15.161 --> 13:16.754
and not have to worry
about it in the morning."

13:16.829 --> 13:19.321
-- That is in no way even remotely
what I was saying. -- I'm sorry...

13:19.398 --> 13:21.867
I'm someone you can't explain
to your parents, okay,

13:21.934 --> 13:25.370
but rest assured it takes a lot more
work to get me into bed than that.

13:25.437 --> 13:27.735
Yeah, unless you're playing the
role of Cass, the new pool boy.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.110
You think I haven't
heard that one before?

13:38.450 --> 13:40.111
[Thunder rumbling]

13:42.488 --> 13:44.889
-- You should take my umbrella!
-- I don't want your umbrella!

13:44.957 --> 13:47.016
-- You're not gonna get a cab in the rain.
-- I'm fine!

13:47.092 --> 13:48.617
-- Listen, Jenny...
-- I don't believe it.

13:48.694 --> 13:49.627
What?

13:49.695 --> 13:51.720
You can't stand in the rain
without an umbrella?

13:51.797 --> 13:53.390
Yes, Jenny, I learned
when I was young

13:53.465 --> 13:55.297
that if I do that,
I'll get wet.

13:55.367 --> 13:58.393
And I learned when I was young
if I get wet, I'll dry off.

13:58.470 --> 14:01.565
I learned not to be troubled
by water falling from the sky.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.268
<i>I learned that, when I was young,
the things that frightened</i> me

14:04.343 --> 14:06.778
might not be so frightening
after all --

14:06.846 --> 14:09.247
that possibly, the only reason
I was frightened

14:09.315 --> 14:11.283
was because I was young.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.717
It was nice
knowing you, Jenny.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.648
You're wearing a raincoat!

14:18.724 --> 14:19.816
What?

14:19.892 --> 14:21.690
It was raining when you
left your apartment.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.286
You don't have an umbrella 'cause
you don't have an umbrella.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.424
Only you won't admit it cause you
are Miss “I meant to do that.

14:27.499 --> 14:29.524
"I'm free and open
and unafraid of rain.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.764

how I meant it to be.</i>

"I have a degree in dance
from Julliard.

"I make X-rated movies now.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.036
But that's
how I meant it to be."

14:37.109 --> 14:38.599
<i>You think I'm timid?</i>

14:38.677 --> 14:41.044
God forbid you should admit
you're not a tough guy.

14:41.113 --> 14:44.515
I'm going inside
until the rain stops.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.052
I was offering you
the umbrella.

14:47.119 --> 14:49.213
No, thank you.

14:49.288 --> 14:52.053
[Thunder rumbling,
siren wailing]

14:54.994 --> 14:56.962
How the hell long can it take
a person to go to an ATM

14:57.029 --> 14:58.463
and pick up food
from six restaurants?

14:58.530 --> 15:00.055
Are the restaurants close
to each other?

15:00.132 --> 15:01.896
Not as close as I led her
to believe, but still.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.059
[Thunder crashing]

15:03.135 --> 15:05.160
<i>Dan: Could you guys
quiet down?!</i>

15:05.237 --> 15:06.932
Did you guys just hear Dan?

15:07.006 --> 15:08.667
Could you guys quiet down?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.641
-- I thought you went home.
-- Evidently I didn't.

-- Dana?
Dana: Hi.

15:18.217 --> 15:19.981
-- What happened?
-- It's raining.

15:20.052 --> 15:21.178
Yes.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.188
No, Casey, it's raining
really, really hard.

15:24.256 --> 15:28.124
-- VVhere have you been? -- f-I thought
<i>it</i> was gonna let <i>up</i> after a few minutes,

15:28.193 --> 15:30.924
and I was just gonna
duck out of it.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.465
The first door I tried
was open.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.057
You know what it was?

15:35.134 --> 15:36.158
A church?

15:37.569 --> 15:39.560

I was gonna say that?

15:40.406 --> 15:43.376

17:32.551 --> 17:34.713
You really came back here
to talk to me about accessories?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.846
A guy, long jumper
named Oscar Parrish,

17:36.922 --> 17:38.515
just set a new world record,

17:38.590 --> 17:41.355
which is what he'd been working
toward his whole life.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.862

No, I don't know him,

17:50.869 --> 17:52.394
Yeah.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.838

VVell, we certainly don't talk
about it when we're naked, Jeremy.

[Siren wailing]

18:13.892 --> 18:16.759
I like you,
and I hurt your feelings.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.763
I wanted to come back here

18:18.831 --> 18:21.698
and insist
that you take my umbrella.

I think you wanted
to come back here

18:24.269 --> 18:26.533

18:38.951 --> 18:41.420
I'm getting wet,
as you can see.

18:41.487 --> 18:45.720
I don't mind, for I am fine
here in the rain.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.316
Pretty big step for you,
is it?

Not monumental, but...

-- So...
-- Yes?

I knew it was gonna rain?

18:54.333 --> 18:55.732
Sure.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.735
This time of year,
there's a low-pressure system

18:57.803 --> 18:59.271
that moves down
from Newfoundland.

18:59.338 --> 19:00.828
Ordinarily,
it moves out to sea

19:00.906 --> 19:02.533
once it hits
Northern New England,

19:02.608 --> 19:05.578
but there's a particularly
unusual Atlantic cold front

19:05.644 --> 19:07.738
that I knew would
keep it coastally contained,

19:07.813 --> 19:10.839
leaving the system no choice
but to move down here.

19:10.916 --> 19:12.008
Wow.

Yeah.

<i>I think that's just an excuse</i>

19:26.632 --> 19:28.498

to have an umbrella.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.879
You're bothered
because he came in second?

19:49.955 --> 19:51.719
He held the record
for five minutes.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.519
That's five minutes longer
than most people do.

You know what? I've heard that kind of
thing, and I'm gonna say this, okay?

19:55.561 --> 19:56.790
If you're good enough
to come in second place,

19:56.862 --> 19:57.988

to be disappointed in it.</i>

themselves, trying new things.

you've got a pretty good life.
