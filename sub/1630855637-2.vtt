WEBVTT

01:08.694 --> 01:10.112
[Uther] You failed...

01:10.196 --> 01:12.239
-Come on!
-...to defend the prince.

01:12.323 --> 01:15.701
[Arthur] The Saxons outflanked
us south and west.

01:15.785 --> 01:18.579
[Uther] You truly are
my bastard.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.289
[impact grunts]

01:20.372 --> 01:22.500
-Father!
-[Merlin] Banish him!

01:22.583 --> 01:24.460
From Dumnonia
and all of Britain.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.508
[groans]

01:30.591 --> 01:32.009
[Arthur, softly]
You're going to make it.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.428
-Muder!
-[Arthur] You're a warrior.

01:34.512 --> 01:36.055
[Merlin] Silurians,
we save the isles,

01:36.138 --> 01:37.807
they thank us
with endless raids.

01:37.890 --> 01:38.973
[Arthur] He's dying.

01:39.058 --> 01:41.602
Merlin, nurture him.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.896
[Merlin] Nimue,
in time, you will be

01:43.979 --> 01:46.565
the most powerful druid
Dumnonia has ever known.

01:46.649 --> 01:47.942
[Nimue] We'll call you Derfel.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.652
It means strong.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.862
[Merlin] Your life must be
a solitary one.

01:51.946 --> 01:54.782
Without union and without child.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.450
What if I refuse?

01:56.533 --> 01:58.869
Then the gods
won't speak to you again.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.454
[screams]

02:00.538 --> 02:02.039
[Uther] The kingdom
of kingdoms has

02:02.122 --> 02:05.417
a new heir,
Prince Mordred.

02:05.501 --> 02:08.253
[Merlin] You have another son,
a man other men will follow.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.715
You walk away now,
and you're never coming back.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.801
[shouting]

02:13.884 --> 02:16.053
[Gundleus] I've come to pledge
my allegiance, High-King.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.598
[Merlin] Come home, Arthur.

02:19.682 --> 02:22.184
Only you can save the isle.

02:22.268 --> 02:24.270
King Gundleus of Siluria.

02:24.353 --> 02:27.314
[Uther] You think Siluria's
treachery can be forgotten?

02:27.398 --> 02:29.066
[howling]

02:29.149 --> 02:30.734
[Gundleus] Set me a test,

02:30.818 --> 02:32.278
worthy of my crimes.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.654
Anything.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.072
[Uther] Anything?

02:35.155 --> 02:36.115
[Gundleus] Anything.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.003
[birds squawking]

02:54.258 --> 02:56.927
[Merlin] Arthur, news of your
father's declining health

02:57.011 --> 02:58.429
has spread far and wide.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.681
[grunts]
Not that far.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.516
He is not long
of this world, Arthur.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.394
You have a brother, Mordred.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.646
Surely you must have
guessed that.

03:07.730 --> 03:10.941
Yes. I heard about
the birth of my brother.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.276
That he's misshapen?

03:12.359 --> 03:14.695
A club foot is no sin, Merlin.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.406
I've seen what he can, will do.

03:18.449 --> 03:22.161
Darkness is coming to Dumnonia.
It's already beginning.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.788
Uther is weakening,
the wolves are circling.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.124
Gundleus of Siluria is
at Caer Cadarn.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.461
-Gundleus?
-Uther's letting

03:30.544 --> 03:32.713
his enemies get
too close.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.007
You must come back with me now.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.259
Only you can
bring the country together.

03:39.595 --> 03:40.596
I'm flattered.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.724
But it's not true.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.435
Let's get you something to eat.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.482
You're resentful
because Uther banished you?

03:54.192 --> 03:55.152
[exhales sharply]

04:01.241 --> 04:02.534
He made me free.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.458
I'm my own man.

04:09.541 --> 04:12.002
No family, no country,
no religion.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.295
Careful, Arthur.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.548
Growing up in Dumnonia...

04:19.760 --> 04:21.971
I didn't know who I was.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.308
I spent half my time
in Caer Cadarn,

04:26.392 --> 04:30.688
the bastard son of a king
who didn't care for me.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.691
And when I wasn't with him,
I was with you in Avalon.

04:37.528 --> 04:39.530
And you taught me
many things, Merlin.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.492
Many things.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.787
And I'm grateful.

04:49.707 --> 04:52.084
I'm sorry
you've come all this way.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.627
Truly, I am.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.255
But you must understand...

04:58.549 --> 05:01.427
the old country has
no sway over me.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.892
I am not coming back.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.713
[indistinct chatter]

05:45.262 --> 05:47.723
[Tewdric] Queen Norwenna...

05:47.806 --> 05:49.558
King Tewdric.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.268
-Queen Norwenna.
-Nimue.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.062
[indistinct chatter continues]

05:54.605 --> 05:55.814
Derfel.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.153
[both laugh]

06:02.613 --> 06:04.281
Father, are you sure about

06:04.364 --> 06:06.658
what you're doing
with Gundleus?

06:06.742 --> 06:08.452
There is someone else.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.705
I've made up my mind.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.002
Father, I know
you've heard the stories.

06:17.086 --> 06:19.171
Arthur's never lost a battle,
he's beaten every enemy...

06:19.254 --> 06:20.756
I won't speak of him.

06:23.092 --> 06:25.928
And I swear, if you do again,
you'll suffer the same fate.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.597
[Morgan] Sorry.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.391
Are they all there?

06:31.475 --> 06:33.102
The ones you expected, yes.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.316
-[coughs]
-Father, you are ill.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.276
The Tribe Kings can wait.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.569
Please.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.619
[indistinct chatter]

06:53.664 --> 06:56.082
[Derfel] Gundleus is
the man who took my mother.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.254
I want him to feel
the pain that I felt.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.172
[whispers] Oh, Derfel...

07:04.550 --> 07:06.593
[laughs]

07:06.677 --> 07:09.721
Derfel, please don't
do anything, please.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.306
[Bedwin] The king is coming.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.066
[Uther breathing loudly]

07:44.965 --> 07:46.300
I am old.

07:53.182 --> 07:55.350
And I will not live long.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.227
[coughs]

08:00.147 --> 08:01.899
[groans]

08:01.982 --> 08:03.400
[retches]

08:06.195 --> 08:08.530
[pants]

08:10.699 --> 08:11.992
[gasping]
I have a...

08:14.494 --> 08:16.205
I have a baby boy.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.042
And Dumnonia is his.

08:21.376 --> 08:24.713
Dumnonia is Mordred's to rule

08:24.796 --> 08:26.173
when I die.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.011
And here...

08:31.094 --> 08:32.304
now...

08:33.513 --> 08:36.975
I will name three men...

08:37.058 --> 08:41.145
who are bound by oath
to defend my son

08:41.230 --> 08:42.813
until he is ready

08:42.898 --> 08:46.151
to assume his kingship.

08:47.569 --> 08:48.946
Bishop Bedwin...

08:50.364 --> 08:53.075
the leader of
the Christian Church in Britain.

08:55.494 --> 08:59.873
Owain, champion of Dumnonia.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.294
And King...

09:06.004 --> 09:07.339
Gundleus.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.548
[Cadwys] What?

09:09.883 --> 09:10.968
He has shown you no loyalty.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.344
He's raided us.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.012
Taken our sheep,
stolen our tin...

09:14.096 --> 09:16.473
Enough!

09:16.556 --> 09:17.975
[coughs]

09:18.058 --> 09:19.643
[breathes heavily]

09:25.565 --> 09:29.903
Gundleus is a king...

09:32.072 --> 09:33.615
without a wife.

09:35.617 --> 09:36.952
And very soon...

09:38.745 --> 09:40.998
my lady Norwenna

09:41.081 --> 09:44.793
will be a queen
without a husband.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.880
When I am gone,

09:48.964 --> 09:52.301
they will be joined in marriage.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.388
But only...

09:56.471 --> 10:00.684
only if he breaks
his alliance

10:00.767 --> 10:03.520
with his Uncle Gorfydd
of Powys,

10:03.603 --> 10:05.939
which Gundleus

10:06.023 --> 10:10.277
has sworn upon his life to do.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.196
[Tewdric] Gorfydd is
Dumnonia's greatest enemy

10:13.280 --> 10:15.991
and Gundleus has always
done his bidding.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.622
No more.

10:28.754 --> 10:30.547
I give you my oath.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.050
And how will you prove
that you've changed allegiance?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.302
[Gundleus] By action.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.929
My Uncle Gorfydd is
sending a war band

10:38.013 --> 10:39.765
into Dumnonia
to steal the harvest.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.266
My men will stop him.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.476
You'll wage war
against your uncle?

10:43.852 --> 10:46.813
For the honor of becoming
Mordred's protector...

10:47.981 --> 10:50.233
and the future husband
of Queen Norwenna...

10:51.777 --> 10:53.195
I swear it.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.874
[indistinct]

11:07.167 --> 11:11.880
[indistinct chatter]

11:12.923 --> 11:14.299
Where are you going?

11:14.383 --> 11:15.801
I have supplies for my lord.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.552
Big man, let him through.
He's with me.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.472
A Saxon?

11:21.473 --> 11:23.100
One of Merlin's orphans.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.851
[Gundleus] Oh?

11:24.935 --> 11:27.145
And why did
Lord Merlin single you out?

11:28.397 --> 11:29.731
I survived a death pit.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.525
[men laughing]

11:34.236 --> 11:35.654
How's that possible?

11:36.738 --> 11:38.156
I have the scars to prove it.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.827
-You wish to see?
-Uh-huh.

11:51.336 --> 11:54.423
You may have fooled
King Uther, Gundleus,

11:54.506 --> 11:56.425
but the gods see you
for what you are.

11:56.508 --> 11:59.344
You're a fork-tongued snake.

11:59.428 --> 12:01.263
So, slither
back on your belly

12:01.346 --> 12:02.973
to your Uncle Gorfydd.

12:06.768 --> 12:09.062
Shh, shh, shh.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.612
Who is this girl,

12:17.696 --> 12:19.322
who dares insult me?

12:21.241 --> 12:22.951
[Owain] This one?

12:23.034 --> 12:25.787
Oh, she's our druidess.

12:25.871 --> 12:26.997
Ah.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.874
I speak for the gods.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.962
The gods...

12:34.045 --> 12:35.464
are gone,

12:35.547 --> 12:37.507
little druidess.

12:37.591 --> 12:38.717
Gone.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.303
[loud rumbling]

12:41.386 --> 12:43.638
[horses neighing]

12:49.644 --> 12:50.896
The gods...

12:52.481 --> 12:53.773
The gods are everywhere.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.987
-[grunts]
-Until the next time.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.071
Ha!

13:03.200 --> 13:04.493
Derfel.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.289
Derfel, please.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.626
Why would you do that?

13:12.709 --> 13:16.004
I had one chance to avenge
my mother and you've just...

13:16.087 --> 13:17.756
You've taken it from me.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.382
They'd have killed you.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.719
But that was my choice,

13:22.802 --> 13:23.762
not yours.

13:23.845 --> 13:26.890
You can't die, Derfel.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.643
The gods,
they have a plan for you.

13:30.769 --> 13:32.521
You've chosen your path.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.901
Just let me choose mine.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.278
Do you think it's easy for me?

13:40.362 --> 13:42.239
Choosing a path without you.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.742
Sometimes I think
I'd like to marry...

13:46.826 --> 13:50.205
have children,
watch them grow,

13:50.288 --> 13:51.790
grow old myself,

13:51.873 --> 13:53.792
with the person I love
beside me.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.132
Sometimes I think
that's all I want.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.928
[whispers] Then do it.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.431
Reach out
and take that life.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.393
[sighs]

14:16.982 --> 14:19.651
Merlin says
my way must be solitary.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.073
He says I will be
a great druidess...

14:26.116 --> 14:27.284
and that I will suffer.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.790
I already am suffering.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.920
Everything's
about Merlin...

14:40.880 --> 14:42.674
and what he chooses for you.

14:43.925 --> 14:47.053
Have you ever thought
maybe he might be wrong?

15:08.533 --> 15:10.535
[wind howling]

15:13.747 --> 15:15.707
[birds squawking]

15:24.174 --> 15:26.551
You must rest,
please, High-King.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.097
[Uther] I'll have
time enough for that.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.323
Well?

15:50.033 --> 15:52.702
Did Gundleus go north?

15:52.786 --> 15:55.622
[clears throat]
He has. Aye, he has.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.248
Er...

15:57.332 --> 15:59.417
Father! Father!

16:02.671 --> 16:04.005
Now, Father.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.300
Now you can rest.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.222
It isn't easy to be the king.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.353
[Morgan] But you've been
the greatest of them all.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.771
Truly.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.152
Now, Father,
you mustn't talk any more.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.449
[Bedwin] My lord.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.710
[groans]

16:45.171 --> 16:49.134
Gundleus is Gorfydd's creature.

16:51.594 --> 16:55.807
See if he has the courage
to stand up to him.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.602
But you can outwit him.

17:02.439 --> 17:03.815
You must.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.074
Owain...

17:15.326 --> 17:16.286
You...

17:18.037 --> 17:19.748
You have been a son to me.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.960
Fight the Saxon in Calleva.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.464
If Dumnonia falls to them,

17:28.590 --> 17:30.467
all of Britain will fall.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.055
[sighs]

17:42.187 --> 17:46.274
I laid two stones

17:46.357 --> 17:47.817
on Mordred's eyes.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.904
And I sent the other one away.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.491
Arthur.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.119
He shone too bright.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.582
Merlin favored him above me.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.083
[Morgan] No.

18:04.167 --> 18:05.668
No, my king.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.587
Merlin loves you.

18:07.670 --> 18:08.963
He loves you.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.801
[Uther] If you have to,

18:12.884 --> 18:14.511
lay down your life...

18:15.553 --> 18:17.096
for your baby brother.

18:18.807 --> 18:19.766
He...

18:21.100 --> 18:22.477
He is your blood.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.271
-He is Pendragon blood.
-I will.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.190
-Promise me.
-I promise.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.316
I promise.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.117
Where is Merlin?

18:39.911 --> 18:41.246
Where is Merlin?

18:42.914 --> 18:44.916
He isn't here.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.795
[groans]

18:48.878 --> 18:52.590
I want to be burned
in the old way.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.175
In Avalon.

18:56.803 --> 18:57.720
Yes.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.724
Yes, Father.

19:01.808 --> 19:06.437
I turned my back on the gods
but I didn't want to.

19:06.521 --> 19:10.775
I had to do it to bring peace
to my kingdom. I...

19:10.859 --> 19:13.278
I... I...

19:13.361 --> 19:15.530
I hope they forgive me.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.659
Do you think they'll forgive me?

19:22.954 --> 19:24.414
[Morgan] I know they do.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.959
Father, I know they do.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.092
Look for me...

19:38.386 --> 19:40.930
when you cross
the water to...

19:41.014 --> 19:42.807
the Otherworld.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.356
[crying]

20:03.578 --> 20:05.538
[sobbing]

20:28.770 --> 20:31.105
[whispers] Don't get lost
in the water.

20:31.189 --> 20:32.857
Be safe in the mist.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.994
[woman screaming]

22:20.131 --> 22:21.299
[exhales sharply]

22:44.864 --> 22:46.074
[indistinct chatter]

22:46.157 --> 22:47.617
[Ligessac singing]

22:47.700 --> 22:48.993
[guard 1] You can do
the night's watch.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.161
[guard 2] You rest well.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.205
[Ligessac continues singing]

22:58.127 --> 23:00.129
[singing]

23:14.102 --> 23:17.814
The song of Uther's victory
at Caer Idarn.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.400
Were you there?

23:23.194 --> 23:25.154
I'm not that old, boy.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.198
[all laugh]

23:30.201 --> 23:32.245
This was my uncle's.

23:32.328 --> 23:34.455
He fought at Caer Idarn.

23:37.959 --> 23:42.213
On the way to the battle,
Uther saw the comet,

23:42.296 --> 23:45.466
said it was
in the shape of a dragon.

23:45.550 --> 23:48.594
After he had beaten the Saxons,

23:48.678 --> 23:52.974
he wiped their blood
on his standard.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.061
And from then on,

23:57.145 --> 24:00.898
he was known
as "The Great Red Dragon".

24:06.779 --> 24:08.823
Britain won't see
a king like him again.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.119
I'm going to tend the sheep.

24:14.203 --> 24:15.830
Join me when you're done.

24:25.381 --> 24:29.760
I'm sorry we couldn't do better
than oat cakes and dried fish.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.764
Oh, no, it's good for me
not to overeat.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.104
Now Queen Norwenna's
beginning to recover

24:40.188 --> 24:41.355
from the death of the king,

24:41.439 --> 24:43.608
she's happy here, isn't she?

24:43.691 --> 24:45.026
[Morgan]
She's surrounded by women...

24:46.152 --> 24:47.612
and mothers.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.113
She feels safe.

24:51.532 --> 24:55.161
Have you heard anything
from Gundleus?

24:55.244 --> 24:57.788
No, we don't know
if he's alive or dead.

24:59.207 --> 25:00.958
If he's fought
Gorfydd's war party,

25:01.042 --> 25:02.293
it could be the latter.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.045
Let's hope so,

25:04.128 --> 25:05.713
for Norwenna's sake.

25:08.341 --> 25:11.093
She doesn't much like the idea
of becoming his wife.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.970
[woman] He's so beautiful.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.555
I don't blame her.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.685
How did you avoid marrying,
Lady Morgan?

25:24.857 --> 25:27.276
[both laugh]

25:27.360 --> 25:30.029
Er, no one would have me.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.699
My tongue is too sharp.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.954
[both laugh]

25:38.037 --> 25:40.790
I think you sharpened it
for that very reason.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.208
[Morgan laughs]

25:43.292 --> 25:44.335
[gasps]

25:47.672 --> 25:50.216
Nimue, what is it?

25:52.885 --> 25:54.095
I don't know.

25:55.179 --> 25:56.347
What did you see?

26:01.602 --> 26:04.272
[birds chirping]

26:04.355 --> 26:06.315
[Lunete] Can't you stay with us
a little longer?

26:06.399 --> 26:08.901
The bishop says
he must return to Caer Cadarn.

26:08.985 --> 26:11.487
Especially with Lord Owain
fighting the Saxons.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.242
I'm glad he didn't
take you with him.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.452
I'm not.
I wanted to fight.

26:18.536 --> 26:20.121
Listen to him.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.290
And I thought I could
make a farmer out of him.

26:22.373 --> 26:25.501
[chuckles] Wouldn't it
feel strange anyway,

26:25.584 --> 26:27.420
to raise a sword
against your own people?

26:27.503 --> 26:29.255
I may have been born
a Saxon, but...

26:30.298 --> 26:32.091
I feel like I'm one of you.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.926
Because you are.

26:34.010 --> 26:36.470
Avalon will always be your home.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.519
[whimpering]

26:49.942 --> 26:51.777
[bird cawing]

26:59.201 --> 27:00.995
[whimpering]

27:25.728 --> 27:27.480
[clatters]

27:29.023 --> 27:31.317
[horses neighing]

27:33.944 --> 27:34.945
Riders.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.454
[horse neighing]

27:50.169 --> 27:52.880
I have come to pay my respects
to Queen Norwenna

27:52.963 --> 27:54.632
and the Edling King.

27:56.258 --> 27:57.676
-Who's she?
-Don't know.

28:00.888 --> 28:03.182
-[horse nickering]
-[exhales]

28:05.226 --> 28:07.937
[Bedwin] Let him pass. He's
the Edling King's protector.

28:08.020 --> 28:08.938
King Gundleus.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.731
Bishop.

28:10.815 --> 28:11.816
Lady.

28:13.484 --> 28:15.111
May I see the child?

28:16.987 --> 28:18.030
Lady Morgan?

28:27.164 --> 28:29.542
How did you fare
with your Uncle Gorfydd?

28:29.625 --> 28:31.335
Oh, I routed his war party.

28:31.419 --> 28:33.504
[sighs] Thank the good lord
for that.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.674
What proof do you have?

28:36.757 --> 28:38.426
Ah.

28:38.509 --> 28:40.094
This.

28:40.177 --> 28:41.554
See?

28:41.637 --> 28:44.807
Inscribed with
the motto of Powys.

28:44.890 --> 28:47.935
"Be so that you are."

28:50.312 --> 28:53.190
I wish to lay this at the feet
of my Queen Norwenna.

28:53.274 --> 28:55.192
Welcome to Avalon,
King Gundleus.

28:55.276 --> 28:56.360
Please.

28:56.444 --> 28:58.362
I am at your service, Lady.

28:59.530 --> 29:00.823
Whatever you need of me...

29:01.949 --> 29:03.451
ask...

29:04.952 --> 29:06.454
and it shall be done.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.165
I am most grateful.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.499
[chuckles softly]

29:10.583 --> 29:12.001
Ah.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.919
How is the young king?

29:14.003 --> 29:15.880
[Norwenna] He grows strong.

29:15.963 --> 29:18.466
The air is good for him here.

29:18.549 --> 29:21.051
Ah, as it is for you, hmm?

29:22.887 --> 29:24.597
I'd like very much
to hear of your adventures

29:24.680 --> 29:26.640
against King Gorfydd.

29:26.724 --> 29:28.934
Would you honor us
and eat with us?

29:29.018 --> 29:30.811
[Gundleus] Oh, I will.

29:30.895 --> 29:32.104
Uh...

29:34.064 --> 29:34.982
May I hold him?

29:37.151 --> 29:38.194
[Gundleus chuckles]

29:38.277 --> 29:40.279
[baby fussing]

29:42.531 --> 29:43.991
Of course.

29:57.505 --> 29:58.881
[Gundleus] Oh.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.927
Well, he's so small.
[chuckles]

30:05.304 --> 30:07.264
[clicks tongue]

30:09.475 --> 30:11.268
A baby cannot rule Britain.

30:13.312 --> 30:16.190
[all gasping and screaming]

30:16.273 --> 30:17.858
No!

30:23.280 --> 30:24.448
[Derfel] Where's Nimue?

30:24.532 --> 30:25.574
Run! To the river!

30:25.658 --> 30:26.700
To the river.

30:26.784 --> 30:27.743
Where's Nimue?

30:28.994 --> 30:30.621
Father.

30:30.704 --> 30:31.580
[Morgan] Run!

30:32.665 --> 30:34.083
[screams] My baby!

30:40.422 --> 30:41.423
-Come on.
-I'll follow you.

30:41.507 --> 30:42.383
I'll follow you.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.099
Whoo!

30:50.182 --> 30:51.850
[yelping]

30:53.102 --> 30:54.270
[screams]

31:03.779 --> 31:06.448
[chanting]

31:13.706 --> 31:15.666
[people screaming]

31:19.086 --> 31:20.379
[chanting softly]

31:21.797 --> 31:23.757
[Gundleus panting]

31:30.097 --> 31:32.891
Leave this sacred place!

31:37.104 --> 31:38.439
[Ladwys] She's protected
by a ghost fence.

31:39.648 --> 31:40.608
Let her be.

31:42.192 --> 31:43.402
I know you.

31:43.485 --> 31:44.987
[chanting]

31:48.157 --> 31:50.367
Leave this sacred place!

31:50.451 --> 31:52.036
No, don't!

31:56.415 --> 31:57.625
[laughs]

31:58.876 --> 32:00.127
Druidess.

32:09.011 --> 32:11.430
Leave now.

32:11.513 --> 32:14.600
Or I'll make your soul scream
for the rest of time.

32:15.851 --> 32:17.895
[grunting]

32:17.978 --> 32:20.272
[screaming]

32:26.320 --> 32:29.031
No! Get off!

32:29.114 --> 32:30.157
[whimpers]

32:31.575 --> 32:32.993
[Nimue] Get off me!

32:35.204 --> 32:36.455
What are you doing?

32:36.538 --> 32:37.998
Taking what's ours.

32:39.041 --> 32:41.043
[grunting]

32:50.678 --> 32:52.638
[both grunting]

33:08.320 --> 33:10.280
[moaning]

33:20.791 --> 33:22.751
[grunting]

33:25.504 --> 33:27.506
[muffled grunting]

33:30.426 --> 33:32.594
[gasps, groans]

33:32.678 --> 33:35.347
[Gundleus grunting]

33:35.431 --> 33:37.391
[man chuckles]

33:57.077 --> 33:58.579
Find anything of value,

33:58.662 --> 33:59.997
then torch the place.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.590
[fire crackling]

34:15.679 --> 34:17.014
[coughs]

34:26.940 --> 34:28.108
[coughs]

34:31.695 --> 34:32.654
Derfel?

34:32.737 --> 34:34.114
Nimue.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.241
Sit up. Sit up.

34:41.789 --> 34:43.206
We have to get out.

34:43.290 --> 34:44.373
Come this way.

34:46.335 --> 34:48.128
[grunting]

34:52.216 --> 34:55.052
[screaming]

35:02.392 --> 35:04.353
[Derfel] Go! Go! Go!

35:17.574 --> 35:19.034
[grunting]

35:22.955 --> 35:23.872
No!

35:34.716 --> 35:36.051
No! [screams]

35:38.303 --> 35:40.013
Stay down, stay down, stay down.

35:46.562 --> 35:48.230
[groans]

35:48.313 --> 35:50.023
-Come on! Come on!
-No.

35:50.107 --> 35:51.316
We need to go!

35:51.400 --> 35:52.317
-We have to go!
-Leave me.

35:52.401 --> 35:53.819
Come on! Come on!

35:55.279 --> 35:56.280
Come on!

36:12.796 --> 36:14.006
[gasping]

36:22.180 --> 36:24.016
[grunting]

36:31.398 --> 36:34.192
[screaming]

36:35.819 --> 36:36.945
[Gundleus] Here they are.

36:38.322 --> 36:41.533
Little chickens,
come home to roost.

36:41.617 --> 36:43.285
[gasping]

36:43.368 --> 36:44.828
You're a lying traitor.

36:44.912 --> 36:47.915
You've broken your oath
to King Uther.

36:47.998 --> 36:49.374
An oath?

36:50.667 --> 36:52.002
Oh?

36:52.085 --> 36:53.045
Sworn on this.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.008
[laughs]

36:59.009 --> 36:59.801
[yells]

37:02.679 --> 37:07.100
Ah, Queen Norwenna,
no more tears, pretty lady,

37:07.184 --> 37:10.437
or they soil that pretty face.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.480
My son.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.315
[Gundleus] I know, but...

37:13.398 --> 37:15.943
For the good of this country,
I had to do it.

37:17.527 --> 37:18.612
But I understand.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.323
You were the mother
of a king, now...

37:22.491 --> 37:24.242
you're nothing.

37:24.326 --> 37:25.452
Nobody.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.454
Let me go.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.206
Oh, where to?

37:29.289 --> 37:30.582
Who to?

37:31.667 --> 37:33.418
Oh, you need a protector.

37:37.089 --> 37:39.174
I suppose I shall
have to take on the role.

37:42.427 --> 37:43.553
Kneel.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.015
Kneel.

37:53.188 --> 37:54.398
Now.

37:55.983 --> 37:57.693
[Bedwin] Queen Norwenna, don't.

37:59.736 --> 38:01.113
Kiss my sword.

38:08.036 --> 38:09.246
[cries]

38:18.755 --> 38:20.465
[breath trembling]

38:21.633 --> 38:23.301
Kiss my sword.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.855
[groans]

38:42.904 --> 38:47.159
The Almighty will
damn you to hell for this.

38:47.242 --> 38:51.121
Now you, go tell the Lords
of Dumnonia what I did.

38:51.204 --> 38:52.998
And if they won't submit to me,

38:53.081 --> 38:55.083
I'll butcher their wives
and children too.

38:55.167 --> 38:57.044
-[yelps]
-[Gundleus] And tell them

38:57.127 --> 38:59.254
I have a pagan as my betrothed.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.589
[grunts]

39:00.672 --> 39:03.050
And she will curse them

39:03.133 --> 39:04.593
as I kill them.

39:07.721 --> 39:11.516
By sunset every man, woman
and child in Dumnonia

39:11.600 --> 39:13.185
will know you for a monster.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.855
Ah, fear breeds obedience,
my love.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.193
Pull back your hair.

39:23.070 --> 39:24.571
What if she's put spells on it?

39:24.654 --> 39:26.448
Oh, no, no, no.

39:26.531 --> 39:30.452
All her powers died
after I took her, remember?

39:31.995 --> 39:33.288
There.

39:36.416 --> 39:37.667
Oh.

39:39.002 --> 39:40.337
Queen.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.925
Queen of Dumnonia.

39:46.426 --> 39:47.928
[both chuckle]

40:22.087 --> 40:23.421
[Nimue] He took my torc.

40:25.340 --> 40:28.385
Merlin gave it to me
for my thirteenth naming day.

40:35.976 --> 40:37.060
[gasps]

40:38.103 --> 40:39.437
It's only me, Nimue.

40:43.150 --> 40:45.068
Morgan's in the boat ahead.

40:45.152 --> 40:47.279
She'll find herbs to soothe you.

40:51.408 --> 40:53.076
Everyone ran.

40:53.160 --> 40:54.995
But you tried to save
Merlin's Hall.

40:59.082 --> 41:00.542
[gasps]

41:05.338 --> 41:06.298
Listen to me!

41:06.381 --> 41:08.175
Let me go.

41:08.258 --> 41:12.095
-Please, please, let me go.
-No, you can't do this!

41:12.179 --> 41:14.389
I won't let you.
I won't let you do this.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.974
No, Derfel, I want to die.

41:16.057 --> 41:17.309
No, you can't.

41:17.392 --> 41:18.768
[Young Nimue] Help!

41:22.606 --> 41:23.773
Help!

41:25.609 --> 41:26.902
Help!

41:39.581 --> 41:41.416
[Derfel] You're not
giving up now.

41:42.626 --> 41:44.294
Give me your arm,
give me your arm.

41:44.377 --> 41:45.962
Keep moving.

41:51.134 --> 41:52.719
[grunting, gasping]

41:53.720 --> 41:55.013
[sobbing]

41:58.808 --> 42:00.101
Listen to me.

42:05.774 --> 42:09.361
You said that I had to stay
alive to do the gods' work.

42:11.279 --> 42:13.240
Why is it not the same for you?

42:17.577 --> 42:19.537
[birds chirping]

42:24.084 --> 42:25.835
[Young Nimue] Help!

42:37.973 --> 42:39.724
[panting]

42:39.808 --> 42:41.017
What is your name?

42:43.770 --> 42:44.980
N-N...

42:46.022 --> 42:48.066
Nimue.

42:48.149 --> 42:50.860
I'm taking you to safety, Nimue.

42:50.944 --> 42:53.613
Manawydn, the sea god,
saved you.

42:53.697 --> 42:55.782
It wasn't Manawydn.

42:57.158 --> 42:59.160
It was...

42:59.244 --> 43:00.662
Nehallenia...

43:02.580 --> 43:03.748
his wife.

43:13.550 --> 43:15.218
[gasps]

43:16.511 --> 43:18.513
[water splashing]

43:32.569 --> 43:35.280
Merlin raised me
because I could see the gods,

43:35.363 --> 43:37.657
but what if I can't now,

43:37.741 --> 43:39.951
because of what
Gundleus did to me?

43:45.206 --> 43:47.375
I want to go
to the Otherworld.

43:48.585 --> 43:49.586
You must let me.

43:53.340 --> 43:57.510
If I do, then Gundleus has taken
everything from me that I love.

43:59.596 --> 44:01.556
I won't let you go.

44:03.224 --> 44:04.642
[baby crying]

44:04.726 --> 44:06.895
You're alive!

44:06.978 --> 44:08.396
Oh.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.857
[Morgan] Move, move, this way.

44:12.901 --> 44:15.070
Is my father with you?

44:15.153 --> 44:17.030
[Morgan] Straight,
straight up here. Come on.

44:20.325 --> 44:21.368
He's gone.

44:21.451 --> 44:23.745
-Huh?
-He's gone.

44:23.828 --> 44:25.372
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

44:25.455 --> 44:26.873
I'm so sorry.

44:26.956 --> 44:28.041
-I'm so sorry.
-[yelps]

44:28.124 --> 44:30.627
[Morgan] Derfel, we must go.

44:30.710 --> 44:32.295
Come, come. We must move.

44:32.379 --> 44:33.880
Nimue.

44:33.963 --> 44:35.215
Come on.

44:46.309 --> 44:47.602
[Morgan] We must
get to Caer Cadarn.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.062
We can't take the road.

44:49.145 --> 44:50.438
The Silurians
will be guarding it.

44:51.564 --> 44:53.024
[Derfel] We have to keep moving.

44:53.108 --> 44:54.734
Gundleus will hunt Nimue.

44:54.818 --> 44:56.027
[Morgan] It's not Nimue
they're after.

44:57.404 --> 44:58.363
Ralla.

45:16.381 --> 45:17.757
[whispers]
I don't understand.

45:19.175 --> 45:21.010
Prince Mordred?

45:21.094 --> 45:22.720
The Edling King?

45:26.599 --> 45:28.435
Lord! Lord!

45:32.480 --> 45:33.565
[speaking in native language]

45:35.650 --> 45:36.693
[gasps]

45:38.236 --> 45:39.446
[Culwyn] The baby...

45:40.572 --> 45:42.323
that Gundleus killed...

45:44.826 --> 45:46.119
it was ours.

45:47.287 --> 45:48.830
Come.
We need to keep moving.

45:48.913 --> 45:50.707
No, no, no,
stop, stop, stop.

45:53.293 --> 45:55.003
Your child...

45:55.086 --> 45:56.171
Is dead.

45:57.255 --> 45:58.882
[Culwyn] We made a...

45:58.965 --> 46:01.926
a secret oath to King Uther.

46:02.010 --> 46:03.261
If the worst happened...

46:04.721 --> 46:05.930
we'd protect his son.

46:06.014 --> 46:07.891
You made that oath. I didn't.

46:07.974 --> 46:09.726
I had no choice.

46:09.809 --> 46:11.603
Please, please, Ralla.

46:12.562 --> 46:13.646
Attack.

46:14.814 --> 46:16.149
Get the horses, my love.

46:17.317 --> 46:19.235
Go north, towards Abona.

46:19.319 --> 46:21.279
You head south.

46:21.362 --> 46:23.364
If they're on the road
to Caer Cadarn,

46:23.448 --> 46:25.408
you bring word to me
and you cut them off.

46:25.492 --> 46:26.409
Go.

46:26.493 --> 46:28.328
[all] Hyah!

46:37.837 --> 46:39.923
Quick, Nimue.

46:40.006 --> 46:42.634
Quick, Nimue.
Nimue.

46:42.717 --> 46:44.093
[baby fusses]

46:46.804 --> 46:48.556
Keep him quiet.

46:54.354 --> 46:55.980
[wings flapping]

47:01.069 --> 47:03.154
A turtle dove alone is
a bad omen.

47:05.782 --> 47:07.825
[horse trotting]

47:13.331 --> 47:15.625
Stay back, stay back, stay back.

47:18.044 --> 47:19.587
-Hush, hush.
-[baby cries loudly]

47:21.756 --> 47:23.800
[baby's cry echoing]

47:23.883 --> 47:25.885
Go, go. Move up.

47:29.264 --> 47:30.932
There. Leave the horses.

47:34.561 --> 47:36.229
-Quick, quick.
-[gasps]

47:40.275 --> 47:41.234
Go.

47:42.569 --> 47:43.695
Quick, Culwyn.

47:45.738 --> 47:47.115
Up there, up there.

47:54.956 --> 47:57.208
[breathing heavily]

48:10.763 --> 48:12.974
[whispers] Now what?

48:13.057 --> 48:14.183
[whispers] We take them.

48:17.895 --> 48:20.023
I've... I've never killed a man.

48:22.108 --> 48:23.318
Neither have I.

48:29.657 --> 48:30.825
[whimpers]

48:38.708 --> 48:40.710
Wait, wait.

48:40.793 --> 48:41.919
Now.

48:43.796 --> 48:45.256
[screams]

48:46.424 --> 48:48.009
[screams]

48:48.092 --> 48:49.844

[birds chirping]

49:26.130 --> 49:28.091
[turtle dove cooing]

49:32.553 --> 49:33.971
They've killed them.

49:35.139 --> 49:36.766
Derfel's dead.

49:41.562 --> 49:43.106
No.

49:43.189 --> 49:44.357
Derfel's alive.

49:49.070 --> 49:51.698
[baby babbling softly]

49:52.699 --> 49:54.701
[breathing heavily]

50:04.752 --> 50:06.212
I thought I'd lost you too.

50:11.968 --> 50:13.761
I cursed him
with our child's name.

50:17.390 --> 50:19.434
He was one of the men
in Merlin's Hall.

50:23.479 --> 50:24.814
He saw.

50:24.897 --> 50:26.607
He doesn't see any more.

50:36.075 --> 50:37.076
You've earned this.

50:44.917 --> 50:47.754
Come. Take what you can
and let's keep moving.

50:50.214 --> 50:51.215
[Derfel] Come on.

50:53.468 --> 50:54.469
Quick.

51:10.318 --> 51:11.569
Let's go, let's go.

51:14.947 --> 51:16.491
On, quick as you can.

51:17.658 --> 51:18.576
Let's move.

51:20.870 --> 51:23.956
It's open ground.
What do we do now?

51:24.040 --> 51:25.583
I say we run.

51:25.666 --> 51:27.001
Let's go.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.419
[Derfel] Move fast, everyone.

51:28.503 --> 51:30.671
-[Morgan] Hurry.
-[Derfel] Fast. Come on.

51:30.755 --> 51:32.215
[Morgan] Ralla, come.

51:32.298 --> 51:33.466
Give him to me.

51:36.677 --> 51:38.137
[Morgan] Let's keep moving.

51:47.021 --> 51:48.105
Nimue.

51:49.148 --> 51:50.316
There they are.

51:50.399 --> 51:51.609
Little rabbits.

51:51.692 --> 51:53.110
With me.

51:53.194 --> 51:55.029
[Morgan] Hurry!

51:55.112 --> 51:57.740
[shouting]

52:01.911 --> 52:03.788
Let's go.

52:08.459 --> 52:09.418
[Morgan] Hurry.

52:14.257 --> 52:15.591
[Derfel] Quick.

52:22.098 --> 52:23.933
Form a circle around the king.

52:32.191 --> 52:34.318
I'll kill him
before he touches you again.

52:34.402 --> 52:36.112
I'll kill myself first.

52:37.864 --> 52:39.282
[Gundleus]
You've led us a dance.

52:41.450 --> 52:42.535
Give me the king.

52:42.618 --> 52:44.287
We will not.

52:45.621 --> 52:47.707
[Gundleus laughs]

52:47.790 --> 52:49.625
Oh, you will.

52:49.709 --> 52:53.754
Unless you
and a stable boy and...

52:53.838 --> 52:57.383
a despoiled druidess
can stop me.

52:57.466 --> 53:00.511
I swore to my father
I'd protect him with my life.

53:00.595 --> 53:02.513
And I keep my oath.

53:02.597 --> 53:04.974
[Gundleus] Well, then we'll
blunt our swords on you, Lady.

53:05.057 --> 53:06.893
You are a traitor
and a murderer.

53:06.976 --> 53:09.854
-A coward.
-Kill him.

53:11.731 --> 53:13.441

53:40.343 --> 53:42.011

53:42.094 --> 53:43.346
Arthur has come.
