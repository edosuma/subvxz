00:04.180 --> 00:06.220
Hey, hey.
Do you guys hear that?

00:06.300 --> 00:09.020
That was me.
I had hot dogs for lunch.

00:10.660 --> 00:14.380
Not that. I'm talking about
the sweet sound of no women.

00:14.460 --> 00:17.140
I never hear that.

00:17.220 --> 00:20.380
Jackie's voice is burned into my brain.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.700
I wish it would stop, but it won't.

00:22.780 --> 00:26.780
Remember back in the day when it was
just us guys? That was good times.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.260
More like desperate,
"I don't care if she has a mustache...

00:29.340 --> 00:32.100
I'll take her anyway" times.

00:32.180 --> 00:35.500
You know what?
I say, who needs women?

00:35.580 --> 00:37.860
Come on! Let's get crazy.
What was that?

00:37.900 --> 00:40.700
Did someone say mini golf?

00:40.740 --> 00:45.020
I'm still not allowed back in there.

00:45.100 --> 00:48.780
I mean, what's the point
of having a windmill you can't ride?

00:48.860 --> 00:51.420
We could go beer bowling.
That's always fun.

00:51.460 --> 00:56.060
I am in, because beer makes you a
better bowler. That's a proven fact.

00:57.700 --> 01:00.740
Wait. Do I have to use
the pink ladies' ball again?

01:00.820 --> 01:05.180
Now, Fez, why do you ask that question
when you already know the answer?

01:05.260 --> 01:08.780
Pink ball only
until I lose my virginity.

01:15.940 --> 01:17.820
Sorry.
Them's the rules.

01:19.580 --> 01:23.140
All right, fellas. You know the rules.
You get a strike, you chug.

01:23.220 --> 01:26.020
You get a gutter ball, you chug.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.780
You get a 7-10 split...

01:28.860 --> 01:30.980
seven to 10 chugs.

01:31.060 --> 01:34.460
Hey, guys, look.
I got 10-pound balls.

01:37.700 --> 01:41.180
Man, that joke never gets old.

01:41.220 --> 01:45.060
Hey, guys, my balls have holes in them.

01:52.820 --> 01:54.660
Now, why isn't that funny?

01:56.420 --> 01:58.260
This is livin'.

01:58.340 --> 02:02.180
A little bowling, a lot of beer,
and just us guys.

02:02.260 --> 02:04.420
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.060
Man, bowling-alley chicks are easy.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074

02:47.240 --> 02:49.080
Jill.
Glad you could make it.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.520
Guys, this is Jill,
the girl I told you about.

02:51.560 --> 02:55.520
Oh, you're the one
that hasn't put out yet.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.640
Ay! Nice to meet you.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.600
You too. So, who's up first?

03:09.640 --> 03:11.680
Me.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.200
Can I be next?

03:19.920 --> 03:21.840
Hey, buddy? Hyde? Buddy?

03:21.920 --> 03:23.760
Can I talk to you for a second, buddy?

03:26.480 --> 03:29.120
Hyde, what's goin' on? I thought
this was supposed to be guys' night.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.960
Don't worry about it, man.
She's-She's cool. She's like one of us.

03:32.040 --> 03:35.280
In three beers,
she'll be belchin' like a Kennedy.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.800
This is "guys' night only," man.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.080
Yeah, I say out with the whore.

03:42.960 --> 03:45.680
Hey, I'll buy the next round of beer.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.080
The whore stays.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.320
Okay, good night, you two.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.360
Boy, that Joanne...
She's somethin', huh?

03:59.440 --> 04:02.160
- Yeah, she's nice. I like her.
- Good. Good.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.480
Me too. Not that I'm ready
to jump into anything.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.040
I hate jumping.
Makes me jiggle.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.960
But I won't like her
if it bothers you...

04:12.040 --> 04:14.400
'cause I know you've had a tough time
since your mom left.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.959
No, Dad, I think it's nice
that you have a friend.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.920
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.320
I also think it's nice that you're
bathing and shaving again.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.360
Yeah. That was a long
eight weeks, wasn't it?

04:25.440 --> 04:27.680
So long.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.560
Boy, Kitty,
you missed a great game.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.680
The Bucks made a last-second shot
and sent those Lakers home...

04:39.760 --> 04:43.720
with their tails between
their California fruitcake asses!

04:45.760 --> 04:47.600
Go home, fruitcakes!

04:49.640 --> 04:52.720
I've never seen old
Pastor Dave so excited.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.320
He swore at the referee.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.480
"Son of a stitch."
I said, "Son of a stitch."

04:59.560 --> 05:03.040
Oh, well, I'm sure that fooled God.

05:03.080 --> 05:07.000
Hey, Dave, the Celtics are in town tomorrow.
You up for it?

05:07.080 --> 05:11.040
- I'm in!
- Oh. Pastor Dave, tomorrow's Sunday.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.360
You have church on Sunday.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.440
Right, church.
Church, right.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.840
Well, just get someone to sub for you.
Every Sunday...

05:20.880 --> 05:23.240
I see six other guys
up there in robes...

05:23.320 --> 05:27.600
who only shake themselves awake
when the wine comes out.

05:27.680 --> 05:30.560
Any one of them could do your job.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.800
Well, if God didn't want me
to go to basketball...

05:32.840 --> 05:36.160
he wouldn't have made
foam fingers so much fun.

05:36.240 --> 05:40.480
Check it out.
The hand of God is pointing at you.

05:42.440 --> 05:45.120
Okay, see you at church.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.680
Yes!
Another strike for Forman.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.440
Man, is there anything better
than bowling with the boys?

05:58.480 --> 06:00.400
Yeah.

06:05.440 --> 06:09.200
- Making out with a chick.
- Exactly.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.000
But first... Hey, Kelso,
there are words on my balls.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.600
Let's go.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.680
Fine. Go.

06:26.320 --> 06:30.640
But they're gonna miss the finest game of
10-pin since "Marvelous" Marv Winkleman...

06:30.720 --> 06:32.920
Wisconsin's "Velvet Thumb."

06:34.960 --> 06:37.080
Yes!
It's another strike!

06:37.160 --> 06:42.000
You guys, I'm in some kind
of... beery zone.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.160
All right. That's it.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.080
Hey, Jill?
Hey, thanks for stopping by.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.720
Hyde, wipe your mouth.
Let's go.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.280
I was gonna go home with Jill.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.280
Well, we came together, Hyde...

07:03.360 --> 07:07.480
so I kind of think
we should leave together.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.720
Fine.
Steven, call me later.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.640
Forman, what the hell
are you doing, man?

07:17.720 --> 07:20.040
Me?
You spent all night...

07:20.120 --> 07:23.640
making out with
little Miss Can't-find-a-bra.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.800
- Hey!
- Come on. You made me the third wheel.

07:26.880 --> 07:31.560
Who cares, man? Her parents are out of town,
and they got a water bed!

07:31.600 --> 07:34.720
But you killed that dream.
I'm out of here.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.760
But... You don't get to storm out, okay?
<i>I</i> storm out!

07:55.280 --> 07:57.160
Hiya, princess.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.640
Rhonda?
What are you doing here?

08:00.720 --> 08:04.000
Waitin' for Fez,
chompin' some cheese curls.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.560
You know what?
Michael doesn't tell me where he goes either.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.800
- I hate that.
- Kelso and Fez are on their way back from bowling.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.560
They want to make out.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.320
How'd you know all this?

08:22.120 --> 08:24.440
Let's French, ladies!

08:24.520 --> 08:28.800
Michael, <i>she's</i> in the loop!
Why am I not in the loop?

08:28.840 --> 08:32.400
All right. Look, Jackie. I don't
know what loop you're talking about...

08:32.480 --> 08:35.120
but...

08:35.200 --> 08:37.159
if she's already in it...

08:37.240 --> 08:40.159
I don't think there's
gonna be room for you too.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.560
Donna.
Well, you're up early.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.000
Surprisingly early.

08:54.080 --> 08:58.880
You slept here?
Already?

08:58.960 --> 09:01.920
You just met!

09:02.000 --> 09:05.480
Listen, Donna,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

09:05.560 --> 09:10.080
Your father and I have started an...
intimate relationship.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.680
And, you know,
it's still a little awkward for us.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.200
Emotionally, not physically.
Well, a little...

09:17.800 --> 09:20.080
I think I might be sick.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.520
Look, I know this is a lot
for you to take in right now.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.440
But I think it would be better
for all of us...

09:24.520 --> 09:26.920
to just stop the charade
and get it all out in the open.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.800
Joanne!
When did you get here?

09:33.880 --> 09:35.960
Oh, my God.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.560
Oh, look at the time.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.520
And on a personal note,
I have an announcement to make.

09:44.560 --> 09:49.200
I have always found happiness in serving
the good people of Point Place.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.240
<i>But after talking to a dear friend...</i>

09:52.320 --> 09:57.200
I realized that church is just not where
the party is, if you know what I mean.

09:57.280 --> 10:01.320
<i>So I'm resigning as your pastor...</i>

10:01.400 --> 10:03.960
thanks to my friend Red Forman.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.880
Red, give the crowd a wave.

10:16.760 --> 10:22.000
Well, if you weren't going to hell before,
you're going first class now.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.400
Go, Bucks!

10:30.760 --> 10:32.960
Kelso, you should tell Jackie
where you go.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
That way, when she wants to do it,
she can find you and do it.

10:37.080 --> 10:40.960
Boy, do I want to do it.

10:41.040 --> 10:46.400
Fez, the foundation of every
good relationship is three words:

10:46.440 --> 10:49.920
"I don't know."

10:50.000 --> 10:52.800
"Where are you going?"
"I don't know."

10:52.840 --> 10:56.120
"What are you thinking about?"
"I don't know."

10:56.200 --> 10:59.480
"Who's that under you?"
"I don't know."

10:59.560 --> 11:02.600
You see, it's bulletproof.

11:02.680 --> 11:05.720
Why are you friends with him?

11:05.800 --> 11:07.680
I don't know.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.680
Hyde, what the hell?

11:13.760 --> 11:16.840
What is she doing in my seat?

11:16.920 --> 11:18.760
I don't know.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.360
That's a good one, Kelso.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.800
Just sit on the floor.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.760
The floor?
Why don't I sit on the floor?

11:25.800 --> 11:30.320
Visitors get the floor, all right?
And that's you, Terri Tube Top.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.640
Oh, and by the way, it's winter!

11:33.720 --> 11:36.280
You're a drag.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.240
Okay, well, sayonara, Yoko.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.400
What?
We're kind of the Beatles.

11:51.450 --> 11:54.410
So it's just supposed to be
guys' night out, right?

11:54.490 --> 11:57.490
And in walks Hyde's skank of the week
to wreck it all.

11:57.570 --> 12:02.090
Years of friendship trumped
by one pair of lopsided boobs.

12:02.170 --> 12:05.650
Yeah, that's right.
I noticed, but I didn't say anything...

12:05.730 --> 12:07.850
because I'm nice.

12:07.930 --> 12:13.050
I had to talk to my dad's new girlfriend
about the sex they had last night.

12:14.810 --> 12:16.650
Yeah, okay, you win.

12:16.730 --> 12:20.170
You know, at first, I thought it was great
my dad had a friend.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.090
But when I found out
they were doin' it...

12:22.170 --> 12:25.810
it took things to, like,
a sick place, you know?

12:25.890 --> 12:28.690
And it really made me realize
that my mom is gone.

12:28.770 --> 12:33.210
- Like, gone.
- Maybe you should say something.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.530
No. He's been through so much.

12:35.610 --> 12:39.410
- I mean, I want him to be happy, you know?
- Yeah.

12:39.490 --> 12:42.330
So Bob's sleeping with Joanne, huh?

12:45.210 --> 12:48.890
God, am I, like, the only guy
in Point Place who's not gettin' any?

12:50.170 --> 12:52.890
Yes. Yes, you are.

12:52.930 --> 12:56.810
- And you think that's funny?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

13:02.210 --> 13:05.050
Well, Mrs. Candiotti
just told me to shove...

13:05.090 --> 13:08.290
a very holy book
in a very unholy place.

13:12.170 --> 13:16.250
Nice going, Red.
The whole church hates us now.

13:16.330 --> 13:20.970
Kitty, I had nothing to do
with Dave leaving the church.

13:21.050 --> 13:25.290
You know, God works in mysterious ways.

13:25.370 --> 13:28.930
- "Let he who is without"...
- Oh, can it.

13:31.010 --> 13:34.890
<i>Well, the torch-carrying mob will be here</i>
<i>any minute. Better turn on the light.</i>

13:36.890 --> 13:38.730
They won't need a light.

13:38.810 --> 13:41.090
They've got torches.

13:53.450 --> 13:56.170
Rhonda?
How'd you get in here?

13:56.250 --> 13:58.410
I used my key.

14:02.210 --> 14:05.010
Michael, why does she
have a key and I don't?

14:05.090 --> 14:10.250
Well, it's not because everyone
doesn't want you to have one.

14:10.330 --> 14:12.490
That's for sure.

14:18.690 --> 14:24.130
- Don't sweat it, small stuff. We're all part of the gang.
- <i>Excuse me?</i>

14:24.210 --> 14:26.490
Uh, no.

14:26.570 --> 14:30.170
I had to kiss butt for, like, a year
to be part of this gang.

14:33.090 --> 14:35.290
That was you being nice?

14:37.250 --> 14:40.850
Good God!
She thinks she was being nice?

14:40.930 --> 14:45.170
Look, all I know is <i>you</i>
are not a part of this gang.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.050
Really?

14:48.090 --> 14:50.170
Well...

14:50.210 --> 14:52.090
Snow White...

14:53.810 --> 14:55.730
why don't we wrestle for it?

14:55.810 --> 14:57.770
And if I win, I'm in.

14:57.850 --> 15:00.690
Street rules.
No tap-outs.

15:00.770 --> 15:03.490
- Okay, okay, you're in!
- Yea! I'm in!

15:06.850 --> 15:08.890
That's nice, but...

15:08.970 --> 15:12.650
maybe you should wrestle her anyways.

15:14.210 --> 15:16.130
Oh, yeah!

15:19.210 --> 15:22.010
All right. Shirts off!
Let's get it on!

15:25.250 --> 15:27.890
Oh, good.
You're both here.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.250
Look, I know you two are together...

15:30.330 --> 15:33.690
and, Dad, I want you to be happy.

15:33.770 --> 15:35.730
But I just don't think
I'm ready for this.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.650
Joanne!
When did you get here?

15:39.850 --> 15:41.730
- Dad!
- Bob!

15:41.770 --> 15:45.770
All right. Donna,
what do you want us to do?

15:45.850 --> 15:49.170
- You want us to stop seeing each other?
- No. No.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.410
It's just that...

15:51.490 --> 15:54.610
Well, could you go back to lying to me?

15:56.250 --> 15:58.290
I mean, that seemed to work.

15:58.370 --> 16:01.570
I am always in favor of lying
when it comes to children.

16:02.730 --> 16:04.650
Bob, we were honest with Donna...

16:04.730 --> 16:06.730
and now she's being honest with us.

16:06.810 --> 16:08.890
We'll hold off on
the overnight visits for a while.

16:08.970 --> 16:13.090
Thank you. Thanks.
That's really... Thanks.

16:14.610 --> 16:18.730
Well, if you're not staying the night,
we'd better get upstairs.

16:23.490 --> 16:25.370
Oh, hey, Hyde.
Is that you?

16:25.410 --> 16:28.090
I didn't recognize you without
Skankarilla hanging off your face.

16:32.770 --> 16:36.450
Are you still on this?
It's like having a wife.

16:36.530 --> 16:40.290
Listen, don't flatter yourself. I'd only
marry someone who's nice to his friends.

16:41.810 --> 16:45.290
Her friends. Shut up.
The... The point is...

16:45.370 --> 16:48.530
Yeah, man, I get the point. And you
can drop it, all right? She dumped me.

16:48.610 --> 16:51.130
- What?
- Yeah. She said she didn't like you.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.210
I told her, "Too bad. We're friends."
And that was it.

16:55.970 --> 16:59.330
Oh, man, I feel terrible.
Is there anything I can do?

16:59.410 --> 17:03.170
I don't know, man.
I kind of really liked her.

17:03.250 --> 17:07.130
Hey, how does 10 bucks sound?

17:13.290 --> 17:16.609
Forman, 10 lousy bucks
can't replace Jill.

17:16.650 --> 17:18.770
Yeah.

17:18.849 --> 17:20.730
How about 20?

17:21.890 --> 17:23.730
Jill who?

17:23.810 --> 17:26.170
Okay.

17:26.210 --> 17:29.770
- Hey, Red.
- Dave, what's with you?

17:29.850 --> 17:31.930
You don't just
up and leave the church...

17:32.010 --> 17:35.130
because I invited you to
a basketball game on Sunday.

17:35.170 --> 17:37.290
Red, you said it yourself.

17:37.370 --> 17:39.890
There are six guys who would take my place.
No one would notice.

17:39.970 --> 17:42.610
Sit down, Dave.

17:42.690 --> 17:44.810
Let me tell you a little story...

17:44.890 --> 17:49.010
about three bags of dog crap.

17:49.090 --> 17:52.250
One on my front porch,
one in my mailbox...

17:52.330 --> 17:55.770
and one in the backseat of my car...

17:55.850 --> 18:00.210
all from people who are
so upset about losing you...

18:00.290 --> 18:05.130
that they are willing to find,
handle and bag dog crap.

18:06.810 --> 18:08.930
Really?
My congregation...

18:09.010 --> 18:13.170
has turned to vandalism
and petty harassment on account of me?

18:13.250 --> 18:15.650
I am truly blessed.

18:15.730 --> 18:18.610
- Then you're staying?
- Yeah.

18:18.690 --> 18:20.570
Good.
Now, come on.

18:20.610 --> 18:24.410
Let's celebrate by returning those bags
to their rightful owner.

18:24.450 --> 18:29.050
Like it says in the Bible,
"As you sow, so shall you reap."

18:29.130 --> 18:32.250
Jesus was talking about love,
but it works for doggy doo, I think.

18:41.090 --> 18:43.970
- Jill, what are you doing here?
- All right. I confess.

18:44.010 --> 18:47.530
'Twas me.
I asked Jill to meet us here.

18:47.610 --> 18:51.290
Jill, Hyde's my friend.
That's no reason to break up with him.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.770
What?
He broke up with me.

18:53.850 --> 18:55.690
He said he had
to spend time with you...

18:55.770 --> 18:59.490
because of some brain inflammation
that made you act like a dill-hole.

19:03.650 --> 19:06.890
But I don't have a brain thing.

19:06.970 --> 19:09.810
He forgets he has it.
It's part of the disease.

19:09.890 --> 19:12.010
Why did you lie to me?

19:12.090 --> 19:14.090
Yeah, and me.

19:16.210 --> 19:18.490
Well, the thing is...

19:18.570 --> 19:21.690
you like the Little River Band.

19:21.770 --> 19:25.770
I mean, I... I can't be with a girl
who likes the Little River Band.

19:27.290 --> 19:29.170
Yeah, take that, missy!

19:30.770 --> 19:34.250
And you! You wouldn't shut up
about me making out on guys' night...

19:34.330 --> 19:38.650
which wouldn't have bothered you
if you had a tongue stuck down your throat.

19:38.730 --> 19:41.610
So for the love of God,
man, find a tongue!

19:44.130 --> 19:46.290
I do need a tongue.

19:47.770 --> 19:51.810
Hey, Jill, I like
the Little River Band.

19:51.890 --> 19:55.170
You're both freaks!

19:56.970 --> 19:59.130
Nice try.

20:00.930 --> 20:03.850
- What are you guys doing here?
- Jackie and Rhonda are all mad at us.

20:03.930 --> 20:08.250
We encourage one little
topless girl fight.

20:08.330 --> 20:10.410
And then all the sudden,
we're the jerks.

20:12.570 --> 20:16.730
- So let's bowl.
- Hey, guys, look. I got 10-pound balls.

20:19.970 --> 20:23.130
Hey, guys, my balls are black and blue.

20:23.210 --> 20:26.690
- Good one.
- That's nice.

20:26.770 --> 20:28.610
- That's funny.
- That was good.

20:30.690 --> 20:33.130
My balls are finally funny.

21:00.290 --> 21:02.170
No, no, no, no.
No tap-outs, you girl.

21:07.050 --> 21:09.330
Yes! We have a winner!
