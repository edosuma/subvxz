10:03.777 --> 10:06.562
and I ran into some ridiculous
traffic on the turnpike.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.607
- No-show, huh?

10:07.650 --> 10:08.999
All right,
thanks for your time.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.088
- Sure.

10:11.132 --> 10:14.222
- You know what, can I ask you
a personal question?

10:14.265 --> 10:17.312
Was Dr. Hensley ever
inappropriate with you?

10:18.792 --> 10:21.446
- Inappropriate how?

10:21.490 --> 10:24.449
- Like,
did he come on to you?

10:24.493 --> 10:27.104
- I'm gay.
I came out two years ago.

10:27.148 --> 10:30.020
Dr. Hensley was the one
who helped me feel comfortable

10:30.064 --> 10:32.632
with my sexuality.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.503
Is he in some kind of trouble?

10:34.546 --> 10:36.766
- Um, one of
his female patients

10:36.810 --> 10:38.942
may have had some issues.

10:38.986 --> 10:42.380
- Wait a minute.
Is her name Kitty Bennett?

10:42.424 --> 10:43.730
- You know her?

10:43.773 --> 10:44.905
- Not in real life,

10:44.948 --> 10:47.124
but she stalked me
on Instagram.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.736
I left a comment on
one of Dr. Hensley's photos,

10:49.779 --> 10:51.825
and she followed me after that.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.478
Then came the private messages.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.132
- What were those messages
about?

10:55.176 --> 10:56.960
- She kept insisting that
we get coffee

10:57.004 --> 10:59.310
to talk trash about
Dr. Hensley.

10:59.354 --> 11:00.572
- But you never met up
with her?

11:00.616 --> 11:02.444
- I don't even talk to
my best friend

11:02.487 --> 11:03.750
about my therapy.

11:03.793 --> 11:06.709
I'm not about to spill
my guts to some rando,

11:06.753 --> 11:10.147
especially about someone
who pretty much saved my life.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.802
- So that's the only contact
that you had with Kitty?

11:12.846 --> 11:16.371
- Well, I made the mistake of
replying to her first message.

11:16.414 --> 11:19.243
She took that as an invitation
to write me every day

11:19.287 --> 11:21.681
for, like, a month.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.944
I finally had to block her.

11:23.987 --> 11:27.382
That chick is
straight-up psycho.

11:34.694 --> 11:34.824
.

11:34.868 --> 11:36.739
- I tracked three of
Dr. Hensley's

11:36.783 --> 11:38.088
other female patients.

11:38.132 --> 11:40.177
They had nothing but nice
things to say about him.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.918
- Well, meanwhile,
Kitty Bennett's got more than

11:41.962 --> 11:43.746
her fair share of run-ins
with the law.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.748
Got disorderly conduct,
a few shop-lifting arrests,

11:45.792 --> 11:48.708
and my personal favorite--
restraining order.

11:50.144 --> 11:52.015
- Who filed for
the restraining order?

11:52.059 --> 11:54.670
- Guy by the name of
Bo Albrecht.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.329
- Kitty Bennett?

12:01.372 --> 12:02.983
She's accusing me of something?

12:03.026 --> 12:05.333
Because you know
she's loony tunes, right?

12:05.376 --> 12:07.901
- You were going out
with her?

12:07.944 --> 12:10.773
- I met her one time
at a cooking class.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.340
I mentioned
I liked her soufflé.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.776
Next thing I know,
she's blowing up

12:13.820 --> 12:14.864
my Facebook Messenger.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.170
- Okay, was there
some flirtation

12:16.213 --> 12:17.301
going on between you two?

12:17.345 --> 12:19.129
- I was just trying
to be nice.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.652
Then she found out
I was a trainer,

12:20.696 --> 12:23.177
started sending me daily
exercise videos of herself

12:23.220 --> 12:25.266
in these sexy gym outfits.

12:25.309 --> 12:26.528
Well, that's when I told her
I had a girlfriend.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.312
- I'm guessing that didn't
go too well.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.140
- She accused me of
leading her on,

12:30.184 --> 12:31.402
so I blocked her.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.100
That only added fuel
to the fire.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.797
- She didn't stop
harassing you?

12:34.841 --> 12:37.234
- Not me, my girlfriend.

12:37.278 --> 12:39.759
Kitty found out Megan waited
tables at The Red Cat.

12:39.802 --> 12:42.413
She showed up during
one of Megan's shifts,

12:42.457 --> 12:44.328
told her I was hitting on her.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.853
That's when I took her to court
and got a restraining order.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.770
- Did you arrest
Dr. Hensley yet?

12:50.813 --> 12:54.643
- Well, there are a few things
that we need to clear up first.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.124
- Like what?

12:57.167 --> 12:58.560
- Well, we spoke to
a few people that

12:58.603 --> 13:01.345
you've been in contact with,
virtual strangers, really.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.043
And from what I understand,

13:03.086 --> 13:05.349
you've engaged in
some behavior that

13:05.393 --> 13:08.700
might be considered stalking.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.398
- Did you talk to Bo?

13:11.486 --> 13:13.836
Mm-hmm. Oh, and did he tell you
that he lied to me

13:13.880 --> 13:16.273
and said that he was single?
- And that the judge

13:16.317 --> 13:18.580
gave him a restraining order
against you.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.887
- [sighs]
That was for his girlfriend.

13:20.930 --> 13:24.151
And when I saw them both
in court, I said I was sorry.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.500
I mean, I apologized.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.807
- Okay, Kitty, we also spoke
with Hannah Berkowitz.

13:32.681 --> 13:35.336
- Okay, look...

13:35.379 --> 13:38.208
I may have, like, crossed
a line with Hannah,

13:38.252 --> 13:40.341
but I was just desperate
to talk to somebody

13:40.384 --> 13:41.864
who had seen Dr. Hensley,
you know?

13:41.908 --> 13:44.432
I wanted to understand
why he had targeted me.

13:44.475 --> 13:47.827
- We spoke with
Dr. Hensley's receptionist,

13:47.870 --> 13:52.266
and there's no record
of any appointment.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.316
- What are you saying,
that I made this up?

13:59.360 --> 14:03.930
- I'm just trying to understand
what really happened.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.412
- I mean, look,
I'm not like some choir girl.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.327
I've made some bad decisions
in my life,

14:10.371 --> 14:12.895
but that is why he thought
he could get away with this.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.766
And you know something?
You're proving him right.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.333
- No.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.945
Kitty, how 'bout we start over?
Okay?

14:21.164 --> 14:24.907
Kitty, I want to believe you,
I do.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.866
Why don't we have a seat?

14:29.956 --> 14:33.307
But I need you to help me.

14:34.438 --> 14:37.920
Are there any details
from that night

14:37.964 --> 14:39.269
that you can remember?

14:39.313 --> 14:42.620
Maybe, you know,
a physical characteristic

14:42.664 --> 14:47.669
or the way he smelled--
any detail at all.

14:49.149 --> 14:53.588
- I mean, I just remember lying
on that red leather couch

14:53.631 --> 14:55.633
and staring up at the ceiling

14:55.677 --> 14:58.506
and just praying for it
to be over.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.117
- I do have a leather couch
in my office.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.684
It's burgundy, not red.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.642
- Red, burgundy--we're not
really Sherwin-Williams here.

15:04.686 --> 15:07.645
So, how would she know that
if she was never there?

15:07.689 --> 15:09.212
- His professional web page.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.605
There's a photo of Josh
at his desk.

15:10.648 --> 15:11.954
The couch is in the background.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.130
- Why make this
false accusation against you?

15:14.174 --> 15:16.741
- I have no idea.
Please.

15:16.785 --> 15:20.354
- Is there any chance that
you had a casual interaction

15:20.397 --> 15:21.659
with this woman,
something that maybe

15:21.703 --> 15:24.706
she construed as flirtatious?

15:24.749 --> 15:27.665
- I just--I cannot think
of anything.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.537
- Does she have a history
of this kind of thing?

15:29.580 --> 15:30.668
- Well,
we're still investigating.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.367
But has anything come up
on your phone

15:33.410 --> 15:36.370
or social media accounts
that seems out of the ordinary?

15:38.763 --> 15:42.376
- Last month somebody sexted
Josh a bunch of nude pics.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.899
- You just bringing
this up now?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.335
- Honestly, I didn't see
the connection.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.207
I mean, the photos were
all different women

15:47.250 --> 15:48.991
like they were pulled from
a porno site.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.297
I figured it was just spam.

15:50.340 --> 15:53.082
- And what about that
dating profile?

15:53.126 --> 15:54.736
- Hold on, what profile?

15:54.779 --> 15:57.652
- I got an email
at my work address.

15:57.695 --> 16:00.524
It was a link to
Josh's dating profile page.

16:00.568 --> 16:01.873
- And I've never done
any online dating.

16:01.917 --> 16:04.006
- I was furious,
but when I really looked at it,

16:04.050 --> 16:05.529
I could tell it was fake.

16:05.573 --> 16:08.489
I mean, the photos of Josh
were also on Google

16:08.532 --> 16:10.099
and some of the information
was wrong.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.580
- Did you reply to the email,
try to figure out who sent it?

16:12.623 --> 16:15.365
- The next day, but the reply
just bounced right back.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.367
- Also, we had a burglary here.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.499
It was about, uh,
what was that,

16:18.542 --> 16:19.717
like, two months ago?

16:19.761 --> 16:21.241
And we reported it to
the 11th Precinct.

16:21.284 --> 16:22.677
- Was anything stolen?

16:22.720 --> 16:24.940
- No, no, I mean, we figured
it was just some kids.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.551
All they did was they poured
a bottle of tomato juice

16:27.595 --> 16:29.292
all over
our wedding invitations.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.859
- Huh.

16:32.339 --> 16:33.296
- All right,
so now they're saying

16:33.340 --> 16:34.732
I broke into their apartment?

16:34.776 --> 16:35.820
- Did you?

16:35.864 --> 16:36.908
- No.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.649
- The text,
the fake dating profile,

16:38.693 --> 16:40.564
those tracked back
to your old job.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.001
You were harassing
these people.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.741
- No, I mean, I was just trying
to protect Lana.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.917
I mean, she needed to know
the truth about the man

16:45.961 --> 16:47.441
she was gonna marry.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.399
- So maybe you met
Dr. Hensley in the city, right?

16:49.443 --> 16:50.618
You thought he was attracted
to you,

16:50.661 --> 16:51.749
so you looked him up
on Instagram

16:51.793 --> 16:53.012
and you found out
he was engaged?

16:53.055 --> 16:55.057
- No, I saw him for therapy.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.712
- Okay, okay.

I mean, after I was raped,
I just missed my period.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.669
And I was really hoping
it was from the stress,

17:41.712 --> 17:44.498

nauseous in the morning.

I took the test
right before you got here.

I'm pregnant,
and he did this to me.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.520

tries to stop me

18:47.213 --> 18:48.214

the father,

18:49.476 --> 18:51.521
he has no right to do that.

right now,
