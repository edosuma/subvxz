00:55.000 --> 00:56.487
Do exactly as I say.

00:56.591 --> 01:00.084
Stand up slowly,
walk ahead of me and open the door.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.004
Freeze!

01:13.109 --> 01:16.132
Everybody freeze! Nobody move!

01:16.236 --> 01:17.761
You, lock the doors.

01:17.866 --> 01:21.136
All of you, eat the floor! Now!

01:21.240 --> 01:22.283
Now!

01:24.988 --> 01:26.725
Get your ass down here now.

01:26.830 --> 01:29.361
Lock it. Right now, lock it.

01:30.536 --> 01:31.994
Eat the floor. Move!

01:39.127 --> 01:40.752
Let's go!

01:43.340 --> 01:46.454
Come on, move it. Go.

01:46.558 --> 01:48.675
Two minutes.

01:52.224 --> 01:53.267
1:45.

02:01.650 --> 02:03.192
Stay down.

02:04.736 --> 02:06.314
One minute.

02:10.366 --> 02:12.110
30 seconds.

02:15.664 --> 02:16.707
Now!

02:25.257 --> 02:26.300

02:26.967 --> 02:29.007

- Hey, Ace, over here.

05:14.559 --> 05:16.871
I'd very much like you to meet Judy.

05:16.976 --> 05:20.250
She can suck a golf ball
through 20 feet of garden hose.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.380
Impressive. Can you excuse us?

05:22.484 --> 05:26.421
Go over there!
Go over there!

05:26.526 --> 05:29.596
Thank you, Judy.
Where'd you find that bitch?

05:29.701 --> 05:32.055
- She's my girl.
- The bitch ain't happy.

05:32.159 --> 05:34.638
I need help.
I need more credit cards.

05:34.742 --> 05:36.142
How many?

05:36.246 --> 05:39.231
American Express blank credit cards.
I need 2,000.

05:39.335 --> 05:42.567
- Get the fuck out of here!
- If you can't handle it,

05:42.671 --> 05:45.360
I'll take my money
to somebody who can.

05:45.464 --> 05:48.198
OK, whoa, whoa.
You got the money?

05:48.303 --> 05:50.363
I said I got a bag of money.

05:50.467 --> 05:53.870
This big, this wide,
full to the brim with money.

05:53.974 --> 05:56.625
- When do you need the cards?
- In three hours.

05:56.729 --> 05:58.500
Get out. Give me time.

05:58.605 --> 06:01.165
I'm a businessman.
I got to make moves.

06:01.269 --> 06:02.457
Three hours!

06:02.562 --> 06:05.299
If you can't help me,
I'll go somewhere else.

06:05.403 --> 06:07.297
I got to move all the time.

06:07.401 --> 06:10.842
- You got the money?
- I got the money. You got the cards?

06:10.946 --> 06:15.847
Listen, you meet me at this address.
Three hours.

06:15.951 --> 06:20.314
Don't have me standing around while
you're messing with the titty woman.

06:20.418 --> 06:22.062
- Three hours.
- Three hours.

06:22.167 --> 06:25.069
- Three hours...
- Three hours...

06:38.182 --> 06:42.211
Hey, Foley, only real cops
can come in here.

06:42.315 --> 06:47.098
- I thought you were dead, Granby.
- I hate to bother you. One question.

06:47.227 --> 06:49.547
- I got to go.
- I'll ask you later.

06:49.652 --> 06:51.639
You act like you never saw a suit!

07:32.564 --> 07:34.687
Detective Axel Foley, please.

07:36.610 --> 07:37.861
Hello!

07:38.904 --> 07:41.767
You has reached the home
of George Kingfish Stephens.

07:41.871 --> 07:44.773
Sorry I'm not in
but I done gone to the Lodge Hall.

07:44.878 --> 07:48.859
Leave a message and I'll get back
at my earliest inconvenience.

07:48.963 --> 07:51.864
- Axel, it's Bogomil.
- Hey! How you doing?

07:51.968 --> 07:54.656
I have to cancel out
on the fishing trip.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.322
Man! I was going to teach you
how to fish.

07:57.427 --> 08:01.829
It's OK cos I'm up to my ass on this
credit card fake - and I'm close.

08:01.933 --> 08:03.709
How's your daughter, Jan?

08:03.813 --> 08:07.583
'If she didn't have a father with
a gun, something would've happened!'

08:07.687 --> 08:09.214
She's great, isn't she?

08:09.319 --> 08:12.339
Look, I'm into something
kind of important here.

08:12.444 --> 08:15.429
I'll fill you in
when I get it straight myself.

08:15.533 --> 08:20.141
I'm late, Axel. Look,
you take care of yourself, you hear?

08:20.245 --> 08:24.809
Listen, punch Rosewood in his eye
and slap Taggart's bald head for me.

08:24.913 --> 08:27.862
Bye, Axel. I'll call you in a week.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.698
Marcy doesn't want to meet you.

08:35.802 --> 08:38.408
Inspector Todd wants
to see you immediately.

08:38.511 --> 08:41.330
What do you mean she
doesn't want to see me?

08:41.433 --> 08:44.416
- She doesn't like you.
- She doesn't know me.

08:44.521 --> 08:47.419
- I described you to her.
- Why?! I help you.

08:47.524 --> 08:50.294
I tell Todd
you're working 24 hours a day.

08:50.398 --> 08:52.423
Jesus, look at that watch.

08:52.528 --> 08:54.922
Jeffrey, please, leave me alone!

08:55.026 --> 08:57.763
I got to work undercover with you.
Why not?

08:57.867 --> 09:00.011
If Marcy won't give me her number,

09:00.115 --> 09:02.596
I'll give you mine
and you pass it on.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.811
I'm very close to shooting you.

09:04.915 --> 09:08.269
As far as undercover goes,
I want to be involved.

09:08.374 --> 09:10.816
- You want to work undercover?
- Yes!

09:10.920 --> 09:14.487
When Todd asks where I am, tell
him I'm pursuing my credit card bust.

09:14.591 --> 09:15.634
Now you're undercover.

09:24.676 --> 09:27.418
LA Times got a letter like that
two hours ago.

09:27.522 --> 09:29.339
He knows that, Billy.

09:30.766 --> 09:32.714
Is this guy serious?

09:32.818 --> 09:35.756
He's serious about
the way he pulled the job.

09:35.860 --> 09:39.550
He knew exactly how long
to stay inside and what to take.

09:39.654 --> 09:41.636
Captain, I have this friend...

09:41.740 --> 09:44.099
Why are you involved with this case?

09:44.203 --> 09:48.058
I assigned you and Taggart
to the Peterson extortion case.

09:48.162 --> 09:51.195
Bogomil, get your men in here.
Come on.

09:53.664 --> 09:56.111
You can't keep God waiting.

09:56.215 --> 09:58.610
I don't want to hear
that kind of talk.

09:58.715 --> 10:01.657
He's fired every cop who
worked for the old chief.

10:01.761 --> 10:03.576
There's only us three left.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.916
He's still head of this department.

10:08.887 --> 10:10.263
Yes, sir.

10:12.891 --> 10:14.712
Very smart, Billy.

10:14.816 --> 10:16.924
I have a relationship with this dude.

10:17.029 --> 10:21.138
Dude? Dude? We're not even
supposed to be working on this case.

10:21.242 --> 10:24.390
Come on, Sarge.
I know you have domestic troubles,

10:24.495 --> 10:26.806
but you got to cool out, relax.

10:26.910 --> 10:30.274
Things like this work out. Trust me.

10:34.037 --> 10:38.821
You moron. You called the
Supervising Agent of the goddamn FBI

10:38.926 --> 10:41.159
to help break this Alphabet code?

10:42.337 --> 10:47.371
This is a local crime. My men
will solve it locally, Roseweed.

10:47.475 --> 10:50.919
- Sir, my name's not Roseweed...
- Shut up, please.

10:51.930 --> 10:54.960
And you, Captain Bogomil,

10:55.065 --> 10:58.005
this Alphabet investigation
was your baby.

10:58.109 --> 11:02.471
Did you call the FBI? Did you order
Rosewood to do that? Did you?

11:02.575 --> 11:05.474
Captain Bogomil didn't know about it.

11:05.578 --> 11:06.845
I said shut up!

11:06.949 --> 11:09.770
Captain Bogomil didn't
call the FBI. I did.

11:09.874 --> 11:12.524
I said shut up.

11:12.628 --> 11:15.442
I'm waiting on you, Andrew.

11:15.547 --> 11:19.905
Did you order him to call
the goddamn FBI or what?

11:20.009 --> 11:22.402
No, sir, but that's beside the point.

11:22.507 --> 11:27.164
No, that is exactly the point.
Thank you. You're history, kiddo.

11:28.383 --> 11:31.081
You know very well
that half of police work

11:31.185 --> 11:33.376
are cops following their hunches.

11:33.480 --> 11:35.503
They go with their gut reaction.

11:35.607 --> 11:39.839
I've encouraged this in my men
and I'm standing behind Rosewood.

11:39.943 --> 11:42.051
Good! Tell me something, Andrew,

11:42.156 --> 11:45.593
how do you consider yourself
a commanding officer?

11:45.698 --> 11:50.015
You can't maintain a supervisory
relationship with your own personnel.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.060
And now you've superseded
the chain of command.

11:53.164 --> 11:55.023
As of now, you are suspended.

11:55.127 --> 11:57.066
- What?
- Shut up!

11:57.171 --> 11:58.983
On what grounds?

11:59.087 --> 12:02.610
You have no control
over your troop's activities.

12:02.715 --> 12:04.696
God damn it, you can't do this!

12:04.800 --> 12:09.367
I can't do it? I will not have
this investigation pissed away.

12:09.471 --> 12:14.000
This crime, this robbery, could be
a political disaster for the mayor.

12:14.104 --> 12:15.794
What about due process?

12:15.899 --> 12:20.007
Policy requires we give you
a board of review within two days.

12:20.111 --> 12:21.717
You got two days.

12:21.821 --> 12:24.675
I am fighting you on this, Harold.

12:24.779 --> 12:26.433
Chief Lutz to you.

12:29.319 --> 12:33.392
Where are you going?
I'm not through with you two guys.

12:33.496 --> 12:37.813
Would you two like to hold onto
your jobs a little while longer?

12:37.918 --> 12:41.411
You report to traffic duty,
effective immediately.

12:42.541 --> 12:44.119
Yes, sir.

13:39.556 --> 13:41.255
- Hi.
- Hi. Trouble?

13:41.359 --> 13:42.402
Yeah.

13:42.643 --> 13:44.674
Maybe I can help.

13:44.778 --> 13:46.590
Yeah, it just stopped.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.930
- Is it getting gas?
- I don't know.

13:56.073 --> 13:58.149
What do you make of this, Andrew?

14:00.327 --> 14:02.070
Who the hell are you?

14:42.244 --> 14:44.071
Hey, Vinnie!

16:25.097 --> 16:27.711
It's all politics here now, Axel.

I don't think they'll let
me and Taggart on it.

16:32.030 --> 16:34.845
- Hold on a minute.
- Hey, Ace!

16:34.949 --> 16:37.976

Take care of Jan, all right?

He told the cops he was from Buffalo.

16:54.133 --> 16:57.450
Hey, man, take off your glasses.

16:57.554 --> 16:59.744
I thought that was you, man.

16:59.848 --> 17:02.870
I did get busted
and I lost my whole investment!

You know I'm a businessman.

17:06.435 --> 17:09.921
You come a half-hour late
and you bring a cop!

17:10.025 --> 17:12.252
What cop? He ain't no cop.

17:12.358 --> 17:15.344
It's Dirty Harry himself.
What's wrong with you?

17:15.448 --> 17:17.137
- Cop?
- Definitely!

17:17.242 --> 17:18.387
He's my nephew.

17:18.491 --> 17:21.558
Well, the dude is definitely
bad luck to me!

17:21.663 --> 17:27.064
I'll tell you what's bad luck.
My friend's in a prison body shop.

17:27.167 --> 17:29.523
- He's a fucking clown.
- What?

17:29.627 --> 17:32.317
I'm checking you for a wire, man.

17:32.421 --> 17:36.071
If he ain't a cop,
why can't I frisk him?

17:36.175 --> 17:37.533
Stop this bullshit.

17:37.637 --> 17:40.197
Why won't he let me frisk him then?
Why?

17:40.301 --> 17:41.700
Cut the bullshit.

17:41.805 --> 17:45.289
I got 2,000 blank
American Express cards. Right now.

17:45.394 --> 17:47.001
You wanna do business?

17:47.105 --> 17:51.041
With you, but not in front of him
because this dude's a cop.

17:51.145 --> 17:53.172
I can smell a pig.

17:53.277 --> 17:57.508
I used to be a Muslim. I know pork.
Yes, pork! Definitely pork.

17:57.612 --> 18:00.347
I ain't doing shit
around this dude, man.

18:00.452 --> 18:02.512
Fuck you, man. Allahu Akhbar.

18:02.616 --> 18:04.432
You calling me a cop?

18:04.536 --> 18:06.569
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

18:15.415 --> 18:17.501
Jeff. Hey.

18:18.126 --> 18:21.035
Where have you been?
Todd's looking for you.

18:21.139 --> 18:23.116
I hope you made the bust.

18:23.220 --> 18:25.746
- Can I count on you, trust you?
- Yes.

18:25.850 --> 18:29.000
We working undercover together?
And you'll be quiet?

18:29.104 --> 18:32.346
- Who are you talking to?
- OK, listen. Shh, wait.

18:35.269 --> 18:38.382
- Drive the Ferrari for a few days.
- The Ferrari?

18:38.486 --> 18:41.054
I'm leaving town
for a few days and...

18:42.693 --> 18:45.684
- I need you to drive the Ferrari.
- Where?

18:45.789 --> 18:47.600
Around. But you have to be me.

18:47.704 --> 18:51.144
- How do I do that?
- Duck down. Drive like this.

18:51.248 --> 18:54.522
- Drive it...
- No one can know it's you.

18:54.627 --> 18:57.319
Don't have people
hanging around the car.

18:57.423 --> 19:00.573
It draws attention to yourself.
Have one person... Marcy!

19:00.677 --> 19:02.239
Drive Marcy in it.

19:02.344 --> 19:04.701
- We're supposed to meet...
- What?

19:04.805 --> 19:07.245
For the car.
She wants to be in the car.

19:07.350 --> 19:09.912
- She likes the car?
- She loves it.

19:10.016 --> 19:15.128
Drive with Marcy, scootch down.
Don't tell anybody about this. OK?

19:15.233 --> 19:19.759
And I know you don't understand,
but this'll make me cop of the month.

19:19.863 --> 19:22.008
We'll be there smiling together.

19:22.112 --> 19:23.806
- I can trust you?
- Yes.

19:23.910 --> 19:26.515
You're my friend?
You understand this?

19:26.619 --> 19:28.735
- No.
- Good.

19:35.787 --> 19:37.819
Inspector T, how you doing?

19:37.923 --> 19:40.203
Where the fuck you been, Foley?

19:42.211 --> 19:45.324
- And what the fuck is this?
- It's a blue slip.

19:45.428 --> 19:47.953
Why the hell you need $1,000?

19:48.057 --> 19:51.750
- A little flash money...
- Flash money? Let's see...

19:53.430 --> 19:55.257
$2,000 for a suit.

19:56.141 --> 19:57.968
$200 for a tie.

19:58.936 --> 20:01.216
A requisition order for a Ferrari.

20:01.320 --> 20:05.175
I've seen enough blue slips.
How about some arrest slips?

20:05.279 --> 20:10.347
I know you're getting upset. You have
reason to be, but I am close.

20:10.451 --> 20:14.687
I am so close now
and it's making me crazy.

20:14.791 --> 20:17.648
I could smell it. It's in the air.

20:17.752 --> 20:20.026
Do you smell it? Cos I smell it.

20:20.131 --> 20:21.944
All I smell is your bullshit.

20:22.048 --> 20:24.611
I'm pouring money
down a bottomless hole.

20:24.716 --> 20:27.159
Where are the bad guys
at the end of this?

20:27.263 --> 20:30.080
Wait. I thought
if there was a problem...

20:30.185 --> 20:32.789
Don't think, Axel!
It makes my dick itch.

20:32.894 --> 20:36.416
Truth is, this department's
furnished you a fortune.

20:36.520 --> 20:40.014
My ass is on the line.
I OK'd all this shit.

20:42.980 --> 20:46.093
I must have been
out of my fucking mind.

20:46.197 --> 20:49.721
But I can't pull out
without a bust or I'm finished.

20:49.825 --> 20:55.187
I promise you, I won't go down alone.
I'm gonna give you three days.

20:55.291 --> 20:58.775
If I don't see some results,
I'll cover my own ass.

20:58.879 --> 21:01.234
How do you like that arrangement?

21:01.339 --> 21:05.449
If I only have three days,
I have to go deep undercover.

21:05.553 --> 21:07.281
I'm deep now. This is deep.

21:07.385 --> 21:09.910
But I'm going deeper.
No more money.

21:10.014 --> 21:12.537
I'm going deep,
deep, deep undercover.

21:12.642 --> 21:16.375
Sign that, and I'm going so deep,
you will not even know...

21:16.479 --> 21:17.748
People will page me.

21:17.852 --> 21:21.588
Axel? No answer
cos I'll be deep undercover.

21:21.692 --> 21:25.547
I'm tired of your bullshit, Foley.
You got three days.

21:25.651 --> 21:29.970
If I don't see results,
I'll grind your ass into dog meat.

21:30.075 --> 21:32.727
Deal. I'll have a dog-meat ass.

21:32.832 --> 21:35.102
Now please sign for my flash money.

21:35.206 --> 21:38.894
Flash money! Make sure
nothing happens to that Ferrari.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.980
That's a $50,000 automobile.

21:41.085 --> 21:46.869
No, no, no. It's $67,000. And fast.
It goes from 100 to 150 in like...

21:48.003 --> 21:51.087
You just better make sure
nothing happens to it.

21:52.508 --> 21:55.416
Don't worry about a thing.
The car's safe.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.208
No one else will be driving but me.

21:58.312 --> 22:02.877
I will sleep, eat, drink, shit...
No, I ain't going to shit.

22:02.982 --> 22:06.051
You thought I was going to...
I ain't gonna shit.

22:06.156 --> 22:09.009
Don't worry about it.
I'm on the job. I'm on the job.

22:09.114 --> 22:10.198
That's what I'm afraid of!

22:26.375 --> 22:28.043
He's OK.

22:29.294 --> 22:32.618
- What are you doing here?
- How's he doing?

22:32.723 --> 22:36.871
If he's strong enough to live
through that, he's got a chance.

22:36.975 --> 22:40.376
- I got to see those letters.
- They're at the station.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.459
Yeah, but we can't take you there.

22:42.563 --> 22:45.172
We're not supposed
to be on that case.

22:45.276 --> 22:48.177
It's a new ball game
and we're not invited.

22:48.281 --> 22:51.512
Neither am I,
but I got to see those letters.

22:51.617 --> 22:53.980
It won't hurt
to let him see them.

22:55.237 --> 22:57.268
OK, but we got to be careful.

22:57.372 --> 23:01.059
Lutz is just looking for a reason
to bust our asses.

23:01.164 --> 23:03.774
Meet me back at the station
in an hour.

23:03.878 --> 23:08.238
I'm going to say hi to Jan
and... take a peek.

23:08.343 --> 23:10.041
- All right?
- OK.

23:14.173 --> 23:15.215
Hey.

23:17.551 --> 23:20.552
- How you doing?
- Oh, Axel.

23:22.347 --> 23:24.334
Oh, come on, stop that.

23:24.438 --> 23:28.300
I get shot like this all the time
in Detroit. He'll be fine.

23:37.154 --> 23:40.683
He was talking about going fishing
until yesterday.

23:40.788 --> 23:45.022
Then... he seemed preoccupied.

23:45.126 --> 23:49.699
I'm gonna come by the house after
I get settled and look around, OK?

23:50.918 --> 23:52.542
Thanks, Axel.

23:56.131 --> 23:58.284
<i>~ Won't change my mind ~</i>

23:58.389 --> 24:00.620

25:12.049 --> 25:15.291
<i>~ There's gotta be a better way... ~</i>

25:16.128 --> 25:18.408
Where are the owners of this house?

25:18.512 --> 25:22.035
They haven't taken possession yet.
They're in Hawaii for a week.

25:22.139 --> 25:25.467
Is there a foreman around? Thank you.

25:35.647 --> 25:39.222
Everybody, stop what
you're doing, please. Stop it!

25:39.326 --> 25:41.265
Stop what you're doing!

25:41.370 --> 25:44.353
Beverly Hills building inspector.

25:44.457 --> 25:48.981
Everybody, stop what you're doing.
I'd like to speak with your foreman.

25:49.086 --> 25:53.362
You. Put the bucket down!
Somebody get me the foreman.

25:53.466 --> 25:57.114
- I'm the foreman here.
- You? Where are the plans?

25:57.218 --> 26:01.450
Cos you're making a very big fucking
mistake. Get the plans, please.

26:01.554 --> 26:04.956
- Who are you?
- I'm the building investigator.

26:05.060 --> 26:07.250
- Nobody told you I was coming?
- No.

26:07.354 --> 26:10.170
Get me the goddamn plans.
Can you guys stop working?

26:10.275 --> 26:13.756
Stop it! Stop working!
Get me the plans.

26:13.861 --> 26:18.008
- Whoa, wait a second. This is wrong.
- What do you mean?

26:18.113 --> 26:22.141
These are the old plans!
Weren't you at the meeting?

26:22.245 --> 26:24.267
- No.
- Before they went to Hawaii?

26:24.371 --> 26:25.850
- No.
- Not at the meeting?

26:25.954 --> 26:30.065
I was there to change these plans.
The Andersons changed the plans.

26:30.170 --> 26:31.398
Oh, man!

26:31.502 --> 26:34.442
There's not supposed
to be any right angles.

26:34.546 --> 26:37.615
- You! You! Stop working!
- Stop working!

26:37.719 --> 26:39.657
You're destroying the house.

26:39.761 --> 26:42.950
Wait! No right angles?
It's like a doughnut.

26:43.054 --> 26:47.082
What are you, a fucking art critic?
Let them live inside a doughnut.

26:47.187 --> 26:51.462
Some people want to live in a round
house. You got the money? Fuck it.

26:51.566 --> 26:54.754
Guys, stop it.
I'll have to straighten this out.

26:54.858 --> 26:56.716
I'll talk to my people,

26:56.820 --> 26:59.969
they'll talk to your people
and nobody gets fired.

27:00.073 --> 27:01.635
I did what they said.

27:01.740 --> 27:04.930
You were right,
but whoever told you's an asshole.

27:05.035 --> 27:08.807
Everybody come down, go home.
Relax. You got the week off.

27:08.911 --> 27:10.894
We'll straighten this thing out.

27:10.998 --> 27:13.440
Give your boys
a big round of applause.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.152
You've done a good job.

27:15.256 --> 27:18.987
Other than the house being square,
it's beautiful.

27:19.091 --> 27:21.698
Go home and relax
for the rest of the week.

27:21.802 --> 27:24.620
I'll straighten this out.
It's Miller time.

27:24.724 --> 27:26.043
All right. Thank you.

27:29.219 --> 27:31.917
So you'll straighten
all this out, huh?

27:32.021 --> 27:35.180
Will you stop worrying and go home?
Trust me.

27:37.186 --> 27:40.768
Could somebody clean this shit up
before you leave?

27:46.445 --> 27:49.142
Lutz's guys are working
on the codes.

27:49.247 --> 27:52.602
Lutz thinks he's a serial robber.
I think he's a nutcase.

27:52.706 --> 27:54.105
Lutz IS a nut case.

27:54.209 --> 27:57.194
Not Lutz. The Alphabet Bandit.

27:57.298 --> 28:00.319
I don't think so.
He's too smart. What else you got?

28:00.423 --> 28:04.960
These shell casings are from
the first robbery at Adriano's.

28:07.049 --> 28:11.539
These are.44 auto mags. They don't
make these any more - too expensive.

28:11.643 --> 28:16.376
This is a casing from a.308 rifle.
They cut it down to fit a.44.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.378
They knew what they were doing.

28:18.482 --> 28:21.634
- Oh, shit. Put this stuff away.
- Who's this?

28:21.738 --> 28:23.967
- Lutz.
- All right. Show time!

28:24.071 --> 28:26.052
What's going on? Who are you?

28:26.156 --> 28:29.105
- Uh, chief, this is...
- Shut up, Rosewood.

28:30.405 --> 28:33.269
Uh, my name is
Johnny Wish... Wishbone.

28:33.373 --> 28:36.275
I'm a psychic from
the island of St Croix.

28:36.379 --> 28:39.278
Yes, I'm a psychic and
I read in the St Croix Gazette

28:39.382 --> 28:43.151
that the Beverly Hills Police
had some trouble solving crime.

28:43.256 --> 28:45.321
So I came to Beverly Hills to help.

28:45.426 --> 28:49.411
They tell me they don't want my help.
I'm a psychic!

28:49.515 --> 28:52.915
I'm a psychic phenomenon.
Watch. I don't know you.

28:53.020 --> 28:56.003
Your name is, um... Lutz! Right?

28:56.107 --> 29:00.043
Chief Lutz, that's your name.
The name pop inside my head.

29:00.148 --> 29:03.551
- And your name is, um...
- Biddle.

29:03.655 --> 29:06.261
Two more seconds
and I'd say it myself.

29:06.365 --> 29:10.559
I don't need no help. I'm Johnny
Wishbone, psychic extraordinaire.

29:10.663 --> 29:14.311
If you need me, just think
Johnny Wishbone and I come.

29:14.415 --> 29:17.232
Lutz and Biddle,
it's like Kibbles and Bits!

29:17.337 --> 29:22.150
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you.
Your name is Johnson, right?

29:22.254 --> 29:25.112
What the hell is going on?
Is this a magic show?

29:25.216 --> 29:28.626
I'll have your badges unless
you go to traffic duty. Get out!

29:30.299 --> 29:34.333
I got angina the minute I saw Foley.
Axel's got nine lives. I don't.

29:34.437 --> 29:36.136
You boys ready? Let's go.

29:38.140 --> 29:41.631
You both know Lutz
is a shit tinhorn politician.

29:41.735 --> 29:46.260
His boy Biddle couldn't catch the
Alphabet killer if he nuked the city.

29:46.365 --> 29:49.264
We got to do this.
All for one, one for all.

29:49.369 --> 29:52.972
Lutz is about to fire our asses.
I'll lose my pension.

29:53.077 --> 29:55.186
I got a wife and two kids to feed.

29:55.290 --> 29:57.435
You got two kids, not a wife.

29:57.539 --> 29:59.355
Shut up. She might come back.

29:59.459 --> 30:02.444
Maureen's divorcing him again.
She's with her mother.

30:02.549 --> 30:05.281
Two years ago, I almost lost my job.

30:05.385 --> 30:08.450
The man put his neck
on the line for me.

30:08.555 --> 30:11.908
I'm not going back to
Detroit without helping him.

30:12.012 --> 30:15.370
And his boys don't even
have any loyalty for him!

30:15.474 --> 30:18.377
OK, don't give me
this crap about loyalty.

30:18.481 --> 30:20.678
Andy and I joined the force together.

30:24.853 --> 30:26.182
OK, OK.

30:27.606 --> 30:31.354
If we do this, it's got to be
low-profile. Covert.

30:32.528 --> 30:35.807
Billy and I have traffic duty,
for Christ's sake.

30:35.911 --> 30:37.780
Give me a break.

30:40.702 --> 30:43.982
- Where'd you get that?
- You stole evidence!

30:44.086 --> 30:46.234
- I only took one.
- Why?

30:46.338 --> 30:48.236
This is known as a clue.

30:48.340 --> 30:51.198
Few people know how
to do this quality work.

30:51.303 --> 30:54.704
- We'll see who recognises it.
- Who are these guys?

30:54.808 --> 30:57.414
This is your town.
You should know that.

30:57.518 --> 31:00.624
There's a guy
at the Beverly Hills Shooting Club.

31:00.729 --> 31:03.292
Russ Fielding.
Supposed to be the best.

31:03.396 --> 31:05.764
Let's go see Russ Fielding, then.

31:19.116 --> 31:21.352
- What's in the bag?
- My vitamins.

31:21.457 --> 31:25.366
- Give them to me.
- You want my vitamins? All of them?

31:27.499 --> 31:29.168
An hour.

31:29.293 --> 31:31.119
Enjoy good health.

31:41.305 --> 31:44.213
- Excuse me.
- One second. What year is this?

31:44.317 --> 31:45.360
'73.

31:46.768 --> 31:48.844
- Yes. It is '73.
- I know.

32:01.283 --> 32:05.190
Ahem. Uh, may I help you?

32:05.294 --> 32:08.528
I'm from
Medalux Explosive Research Company.

32:08.632 --> 32:11.071
Does Russell Fielding work here?

32:11.175 --> 32:12.218
Yes.

32:12.544 --> 32:14.781
He ordered these plutonium-nitrate,

32:14.885 --> 32:17.955
multi-explosive,
sound-seeking projectiles.

32:18.059 --> 32:20.036
Here they go. Have a nice day.

32:20.140 --> 32:22.876
Wait a minute.
What did you say? Medalux?

32:22.981 --> 32:25.374
Medalux Explosive Research Company.

32:25.478 --> 32:28.171
I don't show any record
of that delivery.

32:28.276 --> 32:32.008
I think there must be a mistake.
Your company made a mistake.

32:32.113 --> 32:35.929
- Y'all made a mistake.
- Ha! No. You don't understand.

32:36.033 --> 32:40.643
I know about every delivery here.
They put it in this little log.

32:40.747 --> 32:43.519
We'll straighten this out
with research.

32:43.623 --> 32:49.066
This is a sound-seeking projectile.
I suggest no telephones. Don't cough.

32:49.170 --> 32:51.733
If you break wind,
make it a quiet one.

32:51.838 --> 32:55.612
The slightest peep and your
designer jeans won't fit no more.

32:55.717 --> 32:57.752
Y'all handle this after I go.

32:59.842 --> 33:04.831
Ahem. Excuse me. I just realised,
you could do me a big favour

33:04.935 --> 33:07.793
and drop this off
at Mr Fielding's office.

33:07.897 --> 33:09.590
Let me explain something.

33:09.694 --> 33:12.509
My friend Bootsie
got killed doing this.

33:12.614 --> 33:16.927
I ain't carrying this cos y'all made
a mistake. I carry from A to B.

33:17.032 --> 33:21.226
I have a wife and two kids. I'd
like to see my twin daughters again.

33:21.331 --> 33:24.185
It's right on your way out.
It's no problem.

33:24.289 --> 33:27.191
If you just drop it off
at Mr Fielding's.

33:27.295 --> 33:31.148
What about my daughters, Monique and
Eunique? What's in it for my family?

33:31.252 --> 33:34.073
What do you want?

33:34.177 --> 33:37.659
What's in it for me?
I have beautiful daughters.

33:37.763 --> 33:41.254
You're asking me to risk my life.
What will I get?

33:46.346 --> 33:50.391
$10? I have twin daughters...
with pigtails.

33:51.602 --> 33:55.509
Would you take that off my desk
and drop it off at Mr Fielding's?

33:55.613 --> 34:00.012
That's all I have.
Please take it. I'm sorry, that's it.

34:00.116 --> 34:03.805
- Where's his office?
- Along the corridor, down the steps.

34:03.910 --> 34:06.603
On your way out.
The name's on the office.

34:06.707 --> 34:08.270
Just over there.

34:08.375 --> 34:10.438
I'm just doing this for my kids.

34:10.542 --> 34:12.568
This is how Bootsie got killed.

34:12.672 --> 34:16.072
All they found was $20 and
a pair of Adidas. Down the hall?

34:16.176 --> 34:19.252
Along the corridor. Down the stairs.

34:25.552 --> 34:27.206
We almost got fucked up.

34:27.310 --> 34:28.846
Thank you.

34:31.141 --> 34:34.004
- Shoe money for my daughters.
- Thank you.

34:34.109 --> 34:36.510
$5 a shoe. That's four shoes.

34:39.690 --> 34:43.554
She knew you were hard to live with
when she married you.

34:43.658 --> 34:46.600
It's her fault
for thinking you'd change.

34:46.705 --> 34:48.109
Thanks.

34:49.451 --> 34:51.353
I really have to admire her

34:51.458 --> 34:55.402
for having the courage to leave you
in search for a better life.

34:57.334 --> 35:00.658
I'm sorry. I was trying
to make you feel better.

35:00.762 --> 35:03.323
- Do me a favour?
- Sure.

35:03.428 --> 35:05.499
Take a break from cheering me up.

35:16.478 --> 35:20.262
Keep the grip tight. There you go.

35:22.985 --> 35:24.811
Fire when you're ready.

35:32.244 --> 35:34.652
Grip down here. There you go.

35:35.747 --> 35:36.946
All right.

35:38.375 --> 35:41.293
Keep it up and to the left.
All right?

35:42.796 --> 35:44.617
Excuse me.

35:44.721 --> 35:47.623
- Are you Russ Fielding the gunsmith?
- Yeah.

35:47.727 --> 35:50.120
Have you ever seen this before?

35:50.224 --> 35:53.750
It's a.308 rifle shell
cut to fit the.44.

35:53.854 --> 35:56.304
- Where'd you get it?
- Christmas gift.

35:57.519 --> 36:00.549
Charles Bronson
is a friend of the family.

36:00.654 --> 36:05.931
- He gave me this for Christmas.
- I'm Karla Fry, assistant manager.

36:06.035 --> 36:09.268
How are you?
Beautiful place you have here.

36:09.373 --> 36:12.449
My name's Richard James.
Very nice to meet you.

36:13.702 --> 36:15.900
Russ, could I see you for a minute?

36:16.004 --> 36:19.080
- Be right back.
- Take your time, Russ.

36:20.792 --> 36:22.702
God damn, that's a big bitch.

36:52.616 --> 36:54.814
- Who is that man?
- I don't know.

36:54.918 --> 36:57.773
He's got a.44 auto mag casing
from here.

36:57.877 --> 36:59.858
I saw. You sure it's ours?

36:59.962 --> 37:05.323
- I made a whole bunch for Mr Cain.
- You didn't tell him that, did you?

37:05.428 --> 37:07.285
- No.
- Don't.

37:07.389 --> 37:10.050
Keep him there while I check him out.

37:16.348 --> 37:18.085
I think we have a problem.

37:18.189 --> 37:20.390
Fielding made that casing for Cain.

37:25.607 --> 37:27.434
You wanted to see me?

37:32.906 --> 37:35.520
I'd like to go over plans C and D.

37:35.625 --> 37:40.650
We've promised to deliver Thomopolis
$10 million, Friday at 6pm.

37:40.755 --> 37:42.485
If we fail,

37:42.589 --> 37:46.784
I stand to be put to considerable
inconvenience to say the least.

37:46.888 --> 37:48.826
So I'd like to go over it

37:48.931 --> 37:52.701
and avoid the same mistakes
that were made on the Adriano job.

37:52.805 --> 37:56.004
What mistakes? Adriano's was perfect.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.434
Adriano's was not perfect.

38:08.066 --> 38:10.469
It was perfectly planned,

38:10.573 --> 38:13.439
but it was executed
with incompetence.

38:17.242 --> 38:19.063
It was partly my fault.

38:19.167 --> 38:22.069
I assumed that
if my instructions were clear,

38:22.173 --> 38:24.234
even you could follow them.

38:24.338 --> 38:27.287
- Obviously, I was wrong.
- I don't understand.

38:31.882 --> 38:35.206
You supplied your thugs
with guns from my club?

38:35.310 --> 38:38.997
Yes. But they were totally clean.
Nobody could trace them.

38:39.102 --> 38:43.631
Nobody knows you planned the jobs.
Nobody knows you wrote the notes,

38:43.735 --> 38:46.802
Karla did the job and left the notes.

38:46.906 --> 38:49.805
Then why is there a man in my club

38:49.909 --> 38:53.973
with shell casings
from one of my guns asking questions?

38:54.077 --> 38:55.269
I don't know.

38:57.783 --> 38:59.158
Who is he?

39:00.702 --> 39:03.361
I'd say he's a cop. Wouldn't you?

39:03.466 --> 39:05.662
I don't know. I haven't seen him.

39:08.085 --> 39:11.454
Well, here he is - on television.

39:13.257 --> 39:17.080
Take a good look at him
because you're going to kill him.

39:17.184 --> 39:18.227
What?

39:19.263 --> 39:21.551
Kill him, burn him, blow him away.

39:33.318 --> 39:35.932
How long would it take
to shave those legs?

39:36.037 --> 39:39.315
I suppose you're trying
to be charming.

39:41.034 --> 39:43.814
I'm just offering
my grooming services.

39:43.919 --> 39:45.656
I don't think so.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.447
Chip, perfect timing for once.

39:50.551 --> 39:52.824
Chip Cain. I'm the manager here.

39:52.929 --> 39:57.078
How are you, Chip? Beautiful place
here, very comfortable.

39:57.182 --> 40:02.165
We do our best. Maybe you'd like
to have a guest membership.

40:02.269 --> 40:05.794
That'd be nice, kinda like
shooting guns in the house.

40:05.898 --> 40:08.462
Where can I send you an application?

40:08.566 --> 40:11.925
1603 Hillcrest.
A big white house. Beautiful place.

40:12.029 --> 40:15.221
We'll send it along
with the.44 shells.

40:15.325 --> 40:17.395
Well, I'll be sure to duck.

40:18.739 --> 40:21.141
Goodbye, Mr James.

40:21.245 --> 40:23.356
I guess that's my cue.

40:23.460 --> 40:24.863
Excuse me.

40:29.625 --> 40:31.997
You got a match? Damn.

40:34.505 --> 40:37.074
Richard James. 1603 Hillcrest Road.

40:37.178 --> 40:41.670
Right. Hey, Cain... you got a match?

40:44.473 --> 40:48.850
Here you go. Keep it.
And, Jack, don't screw this up.

40:54.149 --> 40:56.052
What about the cop in hospital?

40:56.156 --> 40:59.567
He's guarded 24 hours a day.

41:02.157 --> 41:05.020
Here's the impending Alphabet note.

41:05.125 --> 41:07.816
Will they be able
to break this one?

41:07.920 --> 41:10.071
They'll crack it
when we want them to.

41:17.339 --> 41:19.332
How'd it go?

41:20.592 --> 41:24.665
What would you guys say if I said
a six-foot blonde works here?

41:24.769 --> 41:27.755
Witnesses reported
a six-foot blonde at Adriano's.

41:27.859 --> 41:29.714
Axel, this isn't Detroit.

41:29.818 --> 41:32.840
Six-foot blonde women
grow on trees in California.

41:32.944 --> 41:35.091
He's right. They're everywhere.

41:35.195 --> 41:39.680
You really need me! You can't
tell there's something weird here?

41:39.784 --> 41:43.602
Meet me at my house
at 1603 Hillcrest in about an hour.

41:43.706 --> 41:45.314
Where are my vitamins?

41:45.418 --> 41:47.146
Oh. Your vitamins...

41:47.250 --> 41:49.275
Here's $20. Get some more.

41:49.379 --> 41:52.989
- My house in an hour.
- What did he do, sell them?

42:09.266 --> 42:10.726
Freeze.

42:11.560 --> 42:15.059
Damn it, Axel.
You scared the hell out of me.

42:16.398 --> 42:19.639
I'm sorry. I let myself in.
How you doing?

42:19.743 --> 42:23.142
I'm tired.
I had some work to do at the office.

42:23.247 --> 42:26.185
- You still at the insurance company?
- Mm-hmm.

42:26.289 --> 42:27.648
Find anything?

42:27.752 --> 42:30.940
A lot of newspaper cut-outs
about oil prices dropping.

42:31.044 --> 42:32.858
Did you invest in oil stocks?

42:32.963 --> 42:35.903
On a cop's pay? No way.

42:36.007 --> 42:39.325
And there's an ad
for a club called 385 North.

42:39.429 --> 42:42.829
Is that one
of your father's hangouts?

42:42.933 --> 42:46.969
Your father got shot
cos he was on to something. But what?

42:48.305 --> 42:51.713
Do me a favour,
use your connections at your company

42:51.817 --> 42:54.717
to find out about
a guy named Maxwell Dent.

42:54.821 --> 42:56.298
I'll try.

42:56.403 --> 43:00.553
Listen, you can let yourself out.
I'm gonna take a shower.

43:00.657 --> 43:01.700
OK.

43:02.486 --> 43:04.360
Don't shoot nobody.

43:49.116 --> 43:52.401
- This has got to be a mistake.
- There's his car.

43:57.124 --> 43:59.911
If he's here,
he must be robbing the place.

44:03.964 --> 44:05.007
Axel?

44:13.140 --> 44:14.183
Axel!

44:15.017 --> 44:17.093
I don't like this, Billy.

44:23.734 --> 44:24.776
Axel?

44:26.236 --> 44:27.851
Why would he be here?

44:27.956 --> 44:30.516
Maybe the Pointer Sisters live here.

44:30.620 --> 44:32.231
- Shh!
- What?!

44:32.335 --> 44:33.820
Out back.

44:34.953 --> 44:37.983
'Thank you.
Welcome to Wheel of Fortune.

44:38.088 --> 44:40.990
'I just thought I heard Jack say...'

44:41.094 --> 44:44.531
Hey!
Watch out. The deck's very slippery.

44:44.635 --> 44:48.747
There's beer in the refrigerator
or you can make yourself martinis.

44:48.852 --> 44:52.915
Wait. You're on duty. No martinis.
Perrier water is what you want.

44:53.019 --> 44:56.421
Swimming trunks in the bedroom.
Dive in the pool.

44:56.525 --> 44:59.425
What are you doing
in a place like this?

44:59.529 --> 45:01.051
What? A place like what?

45:01.156 --> 45:05.680
- Like this. Swimming pool, jacuzzi.
- What? I'm spoiling myself rotten.

45:05.784 --> 45:08.851
The construction?
I am embarrassed about that.

45:08.955 --> 45:13.397
I'm just using the other five
bedrooms - compromising my lifestyle.

45:13.501 --> 45:15.274
You've stolen this house.

45:15.378 --> 45:18.566
How can you steal a house?
It's my uncle's house.

45:18.670 --> 45:22.609
- Is he in rock 'n' roll?
- No! Look at the big titties.

45:22.714 --> 45:26.200
Look at this,
titties, orange juice, beer...

45:26.305 --> 45:29.493
Will you put your trunks on
and get in this pool?

45:29.598 --> 45:33.166
I want you out of this pool and house
in seven minutes.

45:33.270 --> 45:36.875
You're still a police officer!
You'll get us all in deep shit!

45:36.979 --> 45:40.298
I love when you talk dirty.
Get your mad ass in this pool.

45:40.402 --> 45:42.719
Axel, get out of the goddamn pool!

45:45.357 --> 45:47.231
I told you the deck was slippery.

45:49.486 --> 45:53.069
Hey, Taggart!
What's taking you so long?

45:57.953 --> 46:00.029
What do you think? Sharp, huh?

46:35.157 --> 46:38.020
Go right in, Mr President.
Relax. Have fun.

46:38.124 --> 46:41.980
Excuse me. Who are you?
And who are those people?

46:42.085 --> 46:43.862
I'm his representative.

46:43.967 --> 46:46.828
That's former president
Gerald Ford there.

46:49.129 --> 46:51.160
It doesn't look like Gerald Ford.

46:51.265 --> 46:54.619
Have you seen him without make-up?
Probably not.

46:54.723 --> 46:57.626
This is what he looks like now,
the ex-president.

46:57.730 --> 47:00.796
He couldn't get out
when he was running the country.

47:00.900 --> 47:04.753
Now he's a civilian,
it's his right to shake his ass.

47:04.857 --> 47:08.428
He says, "I wanna go to 385 North,"
and I said, "Let's go."

47:08.532 --> 47:12.098
We came to party.
You should be proud to have him here.

47:12.202 --> 47:15.973
- It's our pleasure.
- Thank you very much. Excuse me.

47:16.077 --> 47:18.187
<i>- ~ I'm not your father ~</i>
<i>- ~ Sex ~</i>

47:18.292 --> 47:20.853
<i>- ~ I'm not your brother ~</i>
<i>- ~ Sex ~</i>

47:20.957 --> 47:23.233
<i>- ~ Talk to your sister ~</i>
<i>- ~ Sex ~</i>

47:23.337 --> 47:26.193
<i>- ~ I am alone ~</i>
<i>- ~ Sex ~</i>

47:26.298 --> 47:31.114
<i>- ~ Oo-oooh yeah ~</i>
<i>- ~ Sex ~</i>

47:31.218 --> 47:32.284
<i>~ Ow ~</i>

47:32.388 --> 47:34.451
<i>~ C-c-c-c-come on ~</i>

47:34.555 --> 47:36.786
<i>~ What's your definition of dirty,</i>
<i>baby? ~</i>

47:36.890 --> 47:39.627
<i>~ Don't you think it's time</i>
<i>you had sex with me... ~</i>

47:39.731 --> 47:43.802
- Can I have a Coke with no ice?
- One Coke, no ice, coming up.

47:47.187 --> 47:50.105
- There you go.
- Who's the popular blond?

47:50.941 --> 47:53.895
That's Nik Thomopolis.
He owns this place.

47:56.822 --> 48:00.405
- OK, that's seven bucks, buddy.
- For a Coke?!

48:01.493 --> 48:03.608
I can get blown for $7.

48:03.712 --> 48:05.735
<i>~ All the girls</i>
<i>go crazy over you... ~</i>

48:05.839 --> 48:08.490
Things are getting pretty crazy, huh?

48:08.594 --> 48:11.153
We're getting in deep
with Axel again.

48:11.257 --> 48:14.918
We'll be directing traffic
the rest of our lives anyway.

48:16.008 --> 48:20.081
- The hell with it. To Bogomil.
- To Bogomil.

48:20.185 --> 48:22.459
<i>~ Then maybe I ~</i>

48:22.563 --> 48:25.170
<i>~ Am what you need... ~</i>

48:25.274 --> 48:28.175
Drinks are on the house,
President Ford.

48:28.279 --> 48:31.217
What? My name's John Taggart.

48:31.321 --> 48:35.093
That's the name he's using now.
His marriage is breaking up.

48:35.198 --> 48:39.766
The judge awarded her the name
for the Betty Ford clinic and stuff.

48:39.870 --> 48:42.645
You're much better looking in person.

48:42.749 --> 48:45.523
<i>~ Lovin' you, needing you ~</i>

48:45.627 --> 48:48.325
<i>~ Wanna make you mine, all mine ~</i>

48:49.458 --> 48:51.528
<i>~ And that's the way it is ~</i>

48:51.632 --> 48:53.658
<i>~ It's a love-Iove-hate ~</i>

48:53.762 --> 48:55.663
<i>~ Got to love you... ~</i>

49:01.386 --> 49:04.084
Does the name Thomopolis
mean anything to you?

49:04.188 --> 49:07.588
He's the biggest arms dealer
on the West coast.

49:07.693 --> 49:11.508
- Do I look like Gerald Ford?
- Y'all both look like Gerald Ford.

49:11.612 --> 49:12.926
Come on. Let's go.

49:13.030 --> 49:14.555
<i>~ So hypnotic, baby ~</i>

49:14.659 --> 49:17.219
<i>~ Feels so good to be yours ~</i>

49:17.323 --> 49:22.396
<i>~ Whoa, so let me entertain you... ~</i>

49:42.970 --> 49:44.012
Gun!

49:46.640 --> 49:47.683
Go!

49:56.859 --> 49:59.017
Move it. Get out of here!

50:22.676 --> 50:24.752
Jesus, Billy! Come on, Axel.

50:32.603 --> 50:35.639
Watch yourself.
Anybody in there?

50:41.486 --> 50:43.479
What the fuck is going on here?

50:49.828 --> 50:51.815
Everybody back.

50:51.919 --> 50:53.787
Whoever it was got away clean.

51:00.881 --> 51:02.663
What are you still doing here?

51:02.767 --> 51:05.621
I ran a check -
there is no Johnny Wishbone.

51:05.725 --> 51:10.042
You're illegal. Who the hell
are you and why are you here? Now!

51:10.146 --> 51:13.753
I'm a cop. I didn't say before
cos I knew you'd be upset.

51:13.857 --> 51:17.049
It's a Detroit badge.
Why are you in Beverly Hills?

51:17.153 --> 51:20.843
Uh, I'm attached
to a multi-jurisdictional,

51:20.947 --> 51:23.722
Federal task force
on organised crime.

51:23.827 --> 51:27.938
And my code name...
code name is Wishbone.

51:28.042 --> 51:30.064
I'm the Chief of Police here,

51:30.169 --> 51:33.357
if there's a Federal task force,
I want to know!

51:33.461 --> 51:38.072
You can call back to Detroit tomorrow
and ask for an Inspector Todd.

51:38.177 --> 51:42.324
He'll tell you all about it.
My real name is Axel Foley.

51:42.429 --> 51:46.285
Call there between the hours
of nine and ten, Detroit time,

51:46.389 --> 51:47.872
he'll tell you everything.

51:47.976 --> 51:52.098
Right now, I have the rest of my case
to finish, so excuse me.

51:54.726 --> 51:57.967
And you two,
what the hell were you doing here?

51:58.071 --> 52:00.343
Checking parking meters in the area?

52:00.448 --> 52:04.053
- Well, sir, uh...
- We're off duty, sir. I live nearby.

52:04.158 --> 52:08.392
Now, listen, if you do
anything except traffic duty,

52:08.496 --> 52:11.687
I'll have you both
investigated and suspended!

52:11.791 --> 52:15.731
Well, sir, technically,
this is traffic duty.

52:15.835 --> 52:19.959
Technically, you're a goddamn idiot.
Get out of here, Taggart!

52:21.837 --> 52:23.414
- Yes, sir.
- Jesus Christ!

52:31.597 --> 52:34.218
- Are you sure you got Super glue?
- Yeah.

52:35.350 --> 52:38.258
Yo, man, this is Wild Kingdom.

52:38.363 --> 52:41.133
I tried to create
a stress-free environment.

52:41.238 --> 52:42.763
Well, you have.

52:42.867 --> 52:47.680
These are my friends.
That's Sidney. He's a wandering Jew.

52:47.785 --> 52:49.766
And this is Mona.

52:49.870 --> 52:53.644
Hi, baby. They actually like
different kinds of music.

52:53.748 --> 52:56.485
If I play the Beatles,
the begonias perk up.

52:56.589 --> 52:59.194
If I play Beethoven, they wither.

52:59.298 --> 53:01.905
The ferns like the Boston Pops.

53:02.009 --> 53:04.042
But everybody loves Mozart.

53:05.547 --> 53:06.792
Who's this?

53:07.883 --> 53:11.790
Big Al. Had him about six years.
Isn't he great?

53:11.894 --> 53:13.835
What kind of music does he like?

53:13.939 --> 53:19.047
- James Brown. Drives him nuts.
- Is that turtle shit in there?

53:19.151 --> 53:22.052
You know, turtles are amazing to me.

53:22.157 --> 53:24.050
Hey, what are you doing?

53:24.154 --> 53:28.011
I'm curious to know
where his dick is at.

53:28.116 --> 53:31.852
Give me him. You know where it is,
don't you, Big Al?

53:31.956 --> 53:35.273
- Do turtles have dicks?
- How's it hanging, Big Al?

53:35.377 --> 53:38.399
- Give me that Super glue.
- OK.

53:38.503 --> 53:42.404
Billy's really... out there,
isn't he, Axel?

53:42.508 --> 53:44.707
Yeah, Billy's pretty fucked up.

53:47.047 --> 53:49.538
- I heard that.
- I know. I was joking!

53:50.634 --> 53:52.923
Give me the Super glue.

54:04.648 --> 54:06.347
What's that music from?

54:06.451 --> 54:08.517
- The Dating Game.
- Yeah!

54:17.828 --> 54:20.497
Let's give Billy
a big Dating Game kiss.

54:21.248 --> 54:23.234
- Where's your phone?
- Bedroom.

54:23.339 --> 54:25.456
Where, in the alligator pit?

54:37.639 --> 54:39.762
Jesus, Billy.

54:51.278 --> 54:53.393
- Y'ello?
- 'Jeff? Yeah, Axel.'

54:53.497 --> 54:55.974
Axel. Axel, it's one in the morning.

54:56.079 --> 54:58.983
Jeffrey, stop talking.
How's the Ferrari?

54:59.087 --> 55:02.402
Great. What a great car!
Do those seats go back?

55:02.506 --> 55:05.444
I was with Marcy trying
to get the seats back...

55:05.548 --> 55:07.823
You can't do freaky shit in that car.

55:07.927 --> 55:10.911
You have to do something for me -
you won't like it.

55:11.015 --> 55:12.827
Am I going to get in trouble?

55:12.931 --> 55:16.122
- You see that?
- Weird, huh?

55:16.226 --> 55:18.040
It's not weird. It's simple.

55:18.144 --> 55:22.599
The fumes from the Super glue attach
to the acid from the fingerprints.

55:23.727 --> 55:27.340
It's a street cop trick.
Hasn't filtered down to you boys yet.

55:27.444 --> 55:29.221
Now we have to match it.

55:29.325 --> 55:32.179
- We could use the computer downtown.
- No.

55:32.284 --> 55:35.768
There won't be anybody
there this time of night, Sarge.

55:35.873 --> 55:38.811
Oh, shit.
There goes my medical insurance.

55:38.915 --> 55:42.771
- You can be such a pussy sometimes.
- Really.

55:42.875 --> 55:44.698
Let's go. Come on.

55:50.045 --> 55:53.075
You boys definitely
get an A in High-tech.

55:53.179 --> 55:56.423
It takes 60 cops
to do this shit in Detroit.

55:58.846 --> 56:02.428
Charles Cain.
Used to be Charles Campos.

56:04.768 --> 56:08.592
I just met this guy. He works
in the Beverly Hills gun club.

56:08.696 --> 56:10.387
- He does?
- Yeah.

56:10.492 --> 56:13.096
This ain't the guy - he's a weasel.

56:13.201 --> 56:16.889
- This isn't a master criminal.
- That's his print.

56:16.993 --> 56:20.480
This guy had nothing to do
with Bogomil getting shot.

56:20.584 --> 56:23.484
If he suspected him,
he would've picked him up.

56:23.588 --> 56:25.859
Well, let's put an APB out on Cain.

56:25.963 --> 56:30.324
We can't. All we got is fingerprints.
We need something else.

56:30.428 --> 56:34.453
- What do we do now?
- Let's go to the gun club.

56:34.557 --> 56:37.994
Wait. It's 11:00.
The gun club's closed.

56:38.098 --> 56:40.216
- So?
- So?

56:52.316 --> 56:55.640
This is a big mistake. A big mistake.

56:55.744 --> 56:59.310
It's breaking the law. Once we cross
the line, there's no way back.

56:59.414 --> 57:01.074
I'll go.

57:02.367 --> 57:03.605
I'll go.

57:03.709 --> 57:07.201
See? Would you lighten up
and take some risks?

57:11.502 --> 57:13.293
Fuck it. Let's go.

57:35.275 --> 57:37.057
Oh, shit. Alarm tape.

57:37.162 --> 57:39.359
There are ways around alarm tape.

57:41.406 --> 57:43.271
If we open this door now,

57:43.375 --> 57:46.275
the connection will break
between the magnets.

57:46.379 --> 57:47.940
If we use this foil,

57:48.044 --> 57:52.323
and you squeeze it
between the two magnets,

57:52.427 --> 57:55.159
then take your gum
to hold it in place.

57:55.263 --> 57:59.909
Now the magnets have the illusion
that the connection's not broken.

58:00.014 --> 58:02.048
Then we take our knife...

58:05.180 --> 58:07.932
open the door without...

58:12.354 --> 58:14.968
We walk in
without the alarm going off.

58:15.072 --> 58:16.469
You've done that before.

58:16.573 --> 58:21.600
I wasn't always a police officer,
I fractured a law or two as a kid.

58:21.704 --> 58:23.100
Can I have a piece?

58:23.204 --> 58:25.357
- It's my last one.
- Split it.

58:29.496 --> 58:31.204
None for you.

58:49.057 --> 58:52.473
- What are we looking for?
- A needle in a haystack.

58:54.396 --> 58:56.472
Give me some light over here.

59:00.777 --> 59:01.820
Shit.

59:03.989 --> 59:06.492
Here you go.

59:07.034 --> 59:08.771
- What is that?
- What?

59:08.875 --> 59:09.978
That knife.

59:10.083 --> 59:14.372
- It's mine. Home protection.
- Billy, we gotta talk.

59:16.919 --> 59:18.995
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

59:22.049 --> 59:25.079
- What is that?
- A needle in a haystack.

59:25.183 --> 59:27.004
Map coordinates?

59:56.625 --> 59:57.818
Hello?

59:57.922 --> 01:00:00.781
Is this Inspector Todd
of the Detroit Police?

01:00:00.885 --> 01:00:02.661
Yes, it is.

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:06.580
I'm sorry to be bothering you,
my name is Lionel Hand,

01:00:06.684 --> 01:00:09.418
I'm with
the FBI Enforcement Bulletin.

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:12.959
- 'I read it all the time.'
- Thanks. We're proud of it.

01:00:13.063 --> 01:00:14.590
Don't touch the leather.

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:17.132
My director has asked me to interview

01:00:17.236 --> 01:00:20.009
an exceptional
law enforcement officer,

01:00:20.113 --> 01:00:22.554
and your name came up
on our computer.

01:00:22.658 --> 01:00:23.844
Is that right?

01:00:23.948 --> 01:00:25.347
This is short notice,

01:00:25.452 --> 01:00:29.563
but could you meet me this morning
for breakfast at my office?

01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:31.644
'How's nine o'clock?'

01:00:31.749 --> 01:00:33.730
Yeah, uh-huh. I'll be there.

01:00:33.834 --> 01:00:35.868
Thank you. My pleasure.

01:00:52.389 --> 01:00:53.432
Ring.

01:00:57.102 --> 01:00:59.133
Here's your coffee, sir.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:02.720
Just once a week, I'd like tea.
Do you know what I mean?

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:05.023
- Yes, sir.
- That too much to ask?

01:01:06.695 --> 01:01:08.853
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:01:12.284 --> 01:01:14.360
OK, damn it, who tricked my ass?

01:01:15.996 --> 01:01:20.076
- 440...
- Don't confuse me when I'm dialling.

01:01:25.339 --> 01:01:26.532
This is Todd.

01:01:26.636 --> 01:01:29.201
- 'Inspector Todd?'
- That's what I said.

01:01:29.305 --> 01:01:33.873
This is Harold Lutz. I'm chief of
the Beverly Hills Police Department.

01:01:33.978 --> 01:01:36.375
'Do you have an officer
Axel Foley...'

01:01:36.479 --> 01:01:40.049
Yes, he's under my command,
but he's assigned to some

01:01:40.154 --> 01:01:43.553
multi-jurisdictional,
Federal task force.

01:01:43.657 --> 01:01:47.178
I never know where the hell he is.
It's a real pain.

01:01:47.283 --> 01:01:51.056
I can't control him.
He reports directly to the Feds.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.688
I have to go now.

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:55.618
What the hell are you doing in here?

01:01:57.454 --> 01:02:00.989
- This is not my office.
- You damn right it isn't.

01:02:08.423 --> 01:02:11.332
I want to see if these
coordinates intercept.

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:14.214
What makes you think
they mean anything?

01:02:22.229 --> 01:02:24.926
9752 Gregory Way.

01:02:25.031 --> 01:02:28.220
- City Deposit.
- What's City Deposit?

01:02:28.325 --> 01:02:31.226
It's where banks take their money.

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:34.026
I bet that's the next place
that gets hit.

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:22.025
Unit 21, handle. Unit 22, assist.

01:03:22.129 --> 01:03:24.608
City Deposit, 341 Gregory.

01:03:24.712 --> 01:03:27.239
Lines are down. Unable to verify.

01:03:27.343 --> 01:03:29.293
Can't this car go any faster?

01:03:35.135 --> 01:03:36.178
Hey!

01:03:38.639 --> 01:03:40.430
Come on, guys. Come on.

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.426
- Looks good.
- I got it.

01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:47.677
Out of the hole. Come on. Move it.

01:03:47.781 --> 01:03:49.260
Let's do it.

01:03:49.364 --> 01:03:50.686
OK, here we go.

01:03:57.616 --> 01:03:59.407
Two... one...

01:04:10.671 --> 01:04:12.951
Three minutes!

01:04:13.055 --> 01:04:14.951
Sarge, relax and trust me.

01:04:15.055 --> 01:04:18.834
- You drive worse than Maureen.
- No way!

01:04:22.891 --> 01:04:24.516
Where's the seat belt?!

01:04:34.361 --> 01:04:36.733
- It's a red light!
- It's green!

01:04:40.159 --> 01:04:42.484
- It was red, OK.
- It was yellow!

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:49.459
2:30.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.038
Construction.

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:02.378
Aw, shit!

01:05:03.432 --> 01:05:08.390
- Hey, Taggart, you coming?
- I'm coming! Don't wait for me.

01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:15.435
Two minutes.

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:22.480
Yo, man, what's that for?

01:05:22.584 --> 01:05:26.566
After the club shootout,
I figured I needed more firepower.

01:05:26.671 --> 01:05:28.195
We gotta talk.

01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:31.741
Who do you think you are?
Clint Eastwood? Dirty Rosewood?

01:05:33.962 --> 01:05:35.005
1:30.

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:42.376
Hey! Sound the alarm.
You got a break-in.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.179
I need authorisation.

01:05:47.351 --> 01:05:48.422
Authorised!

01:05:48.526 --> 01:05:51.759
Fuck! Get out of here!

01:05:51.864 --> 01:05:53.812
Come on! Go! Go! Go!

01:05:56.151 --> 01:05:58.856
Get out! Get out! Go!

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:19.582
Hey, Rosewood, get some wheels.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.350
Well, this is pretty sporty

01:06:43.455 --> 01:06:45.646
It's all I could find.

01:06:45.751 --> 01:06:47.940
<i>~ If you stick with me, baby... ~</i>

01:06:48.045 --> 01:06:49.288
Billy!

01:06:49.496 --> 01:06:51.111
<i>~ I won't do you wrong ~</i>

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:54.077
<i>~ And we're gonna have some fun... ~</i>

01:06:55.919 --> 01:07:00.453
Police business! I need your car!
I'm a police officer!

01:07:00.557 --> 01:07:02.369
<i>~ You can't count on anyone... ~</i>

01:07:02.474 --> 01:07:05.801
Oh, God. Here I go again.

01:07:08.932 --> 01:07:10.972
Come on, let's go!

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.969
- You just hit a squad car!
- It's OK. I know the guy.

01:07:20.074 --> 01:07:21.444
He's a jerk!

01:07:24.031 --> 01:07:25.729
<i>~ Lay it on the line ~</i>

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:27.772
<i>~ And I'm saying my last prayer ~</i>

01:07:27.876 --> 01:07:30.275
<i>~ I know you're gonna be there... ~</i>

01:07:36.877 --> 01:07:37.920
Whoa!

01:07:40.422 --> 01:07:43.340
- Does the steering wheel work?
- I'm steering!

01:07:50.224 --> 01:07:53.059
- Do the brakes work?
- I haven't tried them yet.

01:07:59.858 --> 01:08:02.563
Ah, shit, we should have went left.

01:08:04.112 --> 01:08:05.728
<i>~ Got my Continental ~</i>

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:08.278
<i>~ Jam it to the floor... ~</i>

01:08:23.256 --> 01:08:25.133
Oh, fuck!

01:08:25.759 --> 01:08:27.541
<i>~ And I'm saying my last prayer ~</i>

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.335
<i>~ I know you're gonna be there ~</i>

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.751
<i>~ Be there... ~</i>

01:08:30.854 --> 01:08:35.344
Are you driving with your eyes open,
or are you, like, using the Force?

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:42.055
Stop! There's the truck.

01:09:08.676 --> 01:09:10.301
Now what?

01:09:16.435 --> 01:09:18.549
This was the pick-up vehicle.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.389
Let's follow it.

01:09:36.037 --> 01:09:38.697
Sarge? You old bloodhound!

01:09:38.801 --> 01:09:41.116
- Billy, isn't this, uh...
- Yeah.

01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:43.212
No!

01:09:54.848 --> 01:09:57.546
What the fuck is up, man?
Check this out.

01:09:57.650 --> 01:10:01.256
I get $10 for cars,
I get $20 for limos.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.137
What the hell is this?

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:04.726
My truck.

01:10:05.859 --> 01:10:09.477
Here's $50. Put it next to a limo.

01:10:12.866 --> 01:10:15.155
Let me call you back, OK?

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:18.692
- I'm here to clean the pool.
- Your name?

01:10:18.796 --> 01:10:22.529
- I'm the pool cleaner.
- The pool was cleaned yesterday.

01:10:22.633 --> 01:10:27.282
It WAS clean. Today it's dirty.
Somebody made a mistake in the pool.

01:10:27.386 --> 01:10:29.118
What do you mean by "mistake"?

01:10:29.222 --> 01:10:31.414
Someone had a little...

01:10:31.518 --> 01:10:34.207
- uh, accident in the pool.
- Accident?

01:10:34.312 --> 01:10:36.707
There's something floating
in the pool.

01:10:36.811 --> 01:10:39.127
- What?
- During some wild party,

01:10:39.231 --> 01:10:41.379
somebody got drunk
and shit in the pool.

01:10:41.483 --> 01:10:43.881
- I'm here to clean it up.
- I see, uh...

01:10:43.985 --> 01:10:46.383
I ain't happy about it,
but it's my job.

01:10:46.487 --> 01:10:50.013
You write names down, I clean pools.
Where's the pool at?

01:10:50.117 --> 01:10:52.060
Who are these gentlemen with you?

01:10:52.164 --> 01:10:53.771
The Board of Health.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:57.106
They're making sure
I do the job thoroughly.

01:10:57.211 --> 01:11:01.525
If you like, I can bring it by
and you can verify it afterwards.

01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:04.197
- No, that's fine.
- Excuse me.

01:11:08.881 --> 01:11:13.414
<i>~ Hold on, I'm the one</i>
<i>who loves you... ~</i>

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:16.048
Jesus Christ!

01:11:17.222 --> 01:11:21.378
<i>~ Hold on to the one who loves you ~</i>

01:11:21.483 --> 01:11:24.135
Wake up! This is what
we always talked about.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.260
Look alive.
You may never see it again.

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:28.593
I don't want to step
on your tongues.

01:11:28.697 --> 01:11:30.762
Why aren't my parties like this?

01:11:30.866 --> 01:11:33.613
You gotta die sometime.
Might as well be here.

01:11:35.032 --> 01:11:39.149
<i>~ No mystery,</i>
<i>I'm in love with you... ~</i>

01:11:39.254 --> 01:11:40.776
What are we doing?

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.068
Whoever took that truck
is here somewhere.

01:11:44.172 --> 01:11:47.113
How are we supposed to find them?

01:11:47.217 --> 01:11:49.168
Follow your dick.

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:58.248
That's the girl from the gun club.

01:11:58.352 --> 01:12:01.680
- With Dent and Thomopolis?
- Yeah, that big bitch.

01:12:07.814 --> 01:12:10.300
Max! How'd you get in here?

01:12:10.405 --> 01:12:13.558
Forget I asked.
I see how, it's the suit.

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:15.141
Nice suit, Max.

01:12:15.245 --> 01:12:19.606
- This person is annoying us.
- May I see your invitation?

01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:22.776
- I haven't begun to annoy you.
- What's going on?

01:12:22.881 --> 01:12:26.989
It's Max. Check your guest list
cos Max ain't supposed to be here.

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:28.821
Are we having a problem?

01:12:28.925 --> 01:12:32.032
Hef! Hugh Hefner! Axel Foley!

01:12:32.137 --> 01:12:37.202
I feel like I know you already cos
I put your magazine up... Forget it.

01:12:37.306 --> 01:12:39.916
Here's some background
on your guests.

01:12:40.021 --> 01:12:42.793
This is Thomopolis,
he's into guns and drugs.

01:12:42.897 --> 01:12:48.130
And this is Max
and Max kills cops for a living.

01:12:48.234 --> 01:12:50.889
Well, I don't know him. Or you.

01:12:50.993 --> 01:12:55.889
- I think it's time all of you left.
- I happen to be a major contributor.

01:12:55.993 --> 01:12:57.770
We appreciate it. Goodbye.

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:01.022
He appreciates it, Max,
but take your ass home.

01:13:01.126 --> 01:13:03.316
You outdone your welcome.

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:07.780
But it's been real, it's been nice.
Everybody, party's over!

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:11.742
Max fucked it up for everybody,
so let's just go home.

01:13:13.881 --> 01:13:15.701
We'll go ahead as planned.

01:13:15.805 --> 01:13:18.540
Get Cain to prepare E.

01:13:18.645 --> 01:13:22.715
<i>~ Hold on cos I'm on my way ~</i>

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:29.716
- You picked Dent's pocket?
- Ho!

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.177
I told y'all
I wasn't always a cop.

01:13:32.281 --> 01:13:35.515
Yeah, you fractured an occasional law
as a kid.

01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:39.140
This is not good. This is not good.

01:13:39.244 --> 01:13:43.063
See? Every now and then,
an occasional long shot pays off.

01:13:43.167 --> 01:13:45.562
Dent's accountant, Sidney Bernstein.

01:13:45.667 --> 01:13:49.780
Anything Dent's into, he'll have
a record. We'll visit him tomorrow.

01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:51.784
It's all we got to go on.

01:13:56.924 --> 01:13:59.748
There's no B and D,
I'm looking for something.

01:13:59.853 --> 01:14:02.041
And what about that cement truck?

01:14:02.145 --> 01:14:04.706
What about that, Rosewood?
Talk to me!

01:14:04.811 --> 01:14:06.709
I have a theory on that, Chief.

01:14:06.814 --> 01:14:09.809
I think the cement truck
was a tactical decoy.

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:11.839
A decoy?

01:14:11.943 --> 01:14:14.930
A diversion to protect
the criminals' getaway.

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:17.472
That's why it rammed the police car.

01:14:17.577 --> 01:14:20.561
Have you submitted yourself
for drug testing yet?

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:23.058
I want you in by Thursday.
Understand?

01:14:23.162 --> 01:14:26.066
Are you aware that
whoever was in that truck

01:14:26.171 --> 01:14:28.276
foiled the goddamn crime?

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:30.530
- Are you?
- Putz.

01:14:32.042 --> 01:14:35.034
- Did you say something?
- He called you Putz.

01:14:35.138 --> 01:14:37.205
No, I called you a putz.

01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:40.545
He's right... putz.

01:14:42.135 --> 01:14:46.708
And you. You, Mr Scribbler... What
the hell were you doing there, Foley?

01:14:46.812 --> 01:14:49.209
Hey, aren't I
a police officer, too?

01:14:49.313 --> 01:14:50.796
Remains to be seen.

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:53.175
Did you call Inspector Todd for me?

01:14:53.279 --> 01:14:55.802
I did. He doesn't like you very much.

01:14:55.907 --> 01:14:58.346
- OK...
- Hear this insubordination?

01:14:58.451 --> 01:15:03.266
Yes, and I've never heard such abuse.
Whatever's happened, the fact remains

01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:06.562
that the robbery was foiled
and the money was saved.

01:15:06.666 --> 01:15:10.234
If I were you, I'd concentrate
on cracking this code

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.900
and determining where
the E crime will be.

01:15:13.004 --> 01:15:16.778
There's not many targets
beginning with E, so find them.

01:15:16.883 --> 01:15:18.865
- I will, Ted.
- Mayor!

01:15:18.969 --> 01:15:20.791
Yes, Mayor.

01:15:24.344 --> 01:15:27.252
And you! I want you out of here!

01:15:27.357 --> 01:15:29.334
Get out of here, you degenerate!

01:15:29.438 --> 01:15:32.268
You're not even
part of this department!

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:35.889
- Is this a black thing?
- Out.

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:45.602
Weren't you supposed
to leave for Detroit?

01:15:45.706 --> 01:15:49.689
- Yeah, today at noon.
- Well, you're not gonna make it.

01:15:49.794 --> 01:15:51.607
You're gonna get fired.

01:15:51.711 --> 01:15:54.862
We started this together,
we'll finish together.

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:57.081
Check if Bernstein owns a car.

01:15:59.713 --> 01:16:01.699
- Give me a pen.
- Oh, Axel...

01:16:01.804 --> 01:16:04.035
- Give me a pen!
- '86 Mercedes.

01:16:04.139 --> 01:16:07.550
License number CRL 507.

01:16:14.478 --> 01:16:16.592
Naturally, I can see... Yeah...

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:19.347
I mean, I understand.
Somebody... Wait...

01:16:19.452 --> 01:16:23.016
Come right in! Don't let the fact
that my door's closed

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.597
dissuade you from entering my office.

01:16:25.702 --> 01:16:28.894
Beverly Pills Police.
Are you Mr Sidney Bernstein?

01:16:28.999 --> 01:16:30.102
Yes. Lucky guess.

01:16:30.206 --> 01:16:33.776
You have 25 unpaid tickets.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:37.818
- 25? What 25?
- You have 25 unpaid parking tickets.

01:16:37.922 --> 01:16:40.826
I pay my tickets.
I pay all my tickets.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:45.289
Do you own a black Mercedes-Benz,
license plate number CRL 507?

01:16:45.393 --> 01:16:48.330
507? That's my wife's car.
That's not my car.

01:16:48.435 --> 01:16:49.960
You have 25 tickets.

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:54.089
It's under my name, but it's
my wife's car! No, no, no! Bitch!

01:16:54.194 --> 01:16:58.591
These tickets haven't been paid.
Can you cuff Mr Bernstein?

01:16:58.695 --> 01:17:01.175
There are people out
there with chainsaws!

01:17:01.279 --> 01:17:05.098
You have unpaid tickets and
it's your car. We're taking you in.

01:17:05.203 --> 01:17:11.061
Wait. I've got an idea. Is there
something that I have in this office

01:17:11.166 --> 01:17:15.693
that I could hand to you and
that would make you kind of forget

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:19.529
that you're holding those
little pink tickets there?

01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:21.113
What are you saying?

01:17:21.217 --> 01:17:25.534
You'd have something in that hand
and this hand you'd forget about.

01:17:25.639 --> 01:17:29.750
That hand you'd go, "What did
I have there? I don't remember."

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:31.802
You mean if I had, um...

01:17:34.266 --> 01:17:36.419
$200 in this hand?

01:17:36.523 --> 01:17:38.588
Ouch! Let go of my arm.

01:17:38.692 --> 01:17:43.759
$200? Ouch! Please, I'm robbing you.
That's what I'm doing.

01:17:43.863 --> 01:17:46.889
Here's one, here's two.
They're real crisp.

01:17:46.993 --> 01:17:53.186
I have to use your computer to wipe
all evidence of this transaction out.

01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:55.355
No problem. No problem at all.

01:17:55.459 --> 01:17:57.024
Thank you, Sidney, so much.

01:17:57.128 --> 01:17:58.986
Oh, certainly. Certainly.

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:01.530
- Also, one other thing.
- Yes?

01:18:01.634 --> 01:18:03.197
I'm sure you understand

01:18:03.301 --> 01:18:07.074
my contact at headquarters
wouldn't want his name to be known.

01:18:07.178 --> 01:18:10.953
- Don't I know it.
- Could you excuse me while I...

01:18:11.057 --> 01:18:13.001
Oh, yeah, it's secretive.

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:15.711
It's like a James Bond thing!
Yes, yes.

01:18:15.815 --> 01:18:17.755
- Thank you.
- No problem!

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.798
No problem at all.
Anything you want to use.

01:18:20.902 --> 01:18:24.561
- I can't believe...
- I don't want to hear it, Billy.

01:18:37.663 --> 01:18:40.609
- Hey, Jan, Axel. How you doing?
- 'Hi, Axel.'

01:18:40.714 --> 01:18:41.900
What do you got?

01:18:42.005 --> 01:18:45.491
Strange. Before 1978,
everything's blank.

01:18:45.596 --> 01:18:49.788
'It's classified,
but its policy date is 1974.'

01:18:49.893 --> 01:18:52.369
I checked our foreign office
in London

01:18:52.473 --> 01:18:54.584
and found something very interesting.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:59.213
'Dent was the cultural attachÃ© to
the East German embassy in Honduras.'

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:03.005
He's got a racetrack, shooting club,

01:19:03.109 --> 01:19:06.135
drilling rig companies,
an oil company.

01:19:06.239 --> 01:19:09.474
- Oil company?
- 'That's his biggest business.'

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:13.183
But from these records,
seems like Dent's in trouble.

01:19:13.287 --> 01:19:17.733
'He's let his insurance lapse on
everything in the last six months.'

01:19:17.837 --> 01:19:20.691
Dent Petroleum,
even the shooting club.

01:19:20.795 --> 01:19:23.320
All his businesses except one.

01:19:23.424 --> 01:19:27.367
- Which one is that?
- 'The racetrack. Empyrean Fields.'

01:19:29.339 --> 01:19:31.742
He's got a huge policy on that one.

01:19:31.846 --> 01:19:35.371
Good, good, good, good, good.
OK. Great.

01:19:35.476 --> 01:19:37.918
Hey, when your father wakes up...

01:19:38.022 --> 01:19:40.295
'He's better. He's up and around.'

01:19:40.399 --> 01:19:42.794
- 'Tell him you found his man.'
- OK.

01:19:42.899 --> 01:19:44.093
Bye-bye.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.975
Empyrean Fields.

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:55.561
- Rip off his own racetrack?
- Yes, if it's insured.

01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:56.978
What was in the files?

01:19:57.083 --> 01:19:59.734
We won't find oil field equipment
if we find Dent.

01:19:59.839 --> 01:20:01.232
IF we find him?

01:20:01.336 --> 01:20:04.487
Dent's visa to Costa Rico
had today's date on it.

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:06.955
If we don't step on it,
he's out of here.

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:21.167
I, uh... I don't know what happened
on the City Deposit, Max.

01:20:21.271 --> 01:20:22.891
And the Foley hit?

01:20:24.061 --> 01:20:25.472
I don't know.

01:20:27.981 --> 01:20:31.389
That's why I need you
to go along personally

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.849
to make certain nothing goes wrong.

01:20:33.953 --> 01:20:36.437
I'm on the team, of course.

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:49.617
Hey, hey, hey. I broke it.

01:20:49.721 --> 01:20:52.703
You son of a bitch.
You beat the computer?

01:20:52.807 --> 01:20:57.332
- What's it say?
- "Chinguen sus puercos, Carlos."

01:20:57.436 --> 01:20:59.830
Screw you cops. Signed, Carlos.

01:20:59.934 --> 01:21:03.209
- Puercos ain't cops.
- Pigs. Another word for cops.

01:21:03.314 --> 01:21:06.632
Wait a minute, Carlos?
It is Cain. Charles Cain.

01:21:06.737 --> 01:21:08.760
Carlos is Spanish for Charles.

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:12.679
Cain changed his name.
He didn't want to grow up to be poor.

01:21:12.783 --> 01:21:16.471
- Cain is the Alphabet robber?
- I ain't said that.

01:21:16.576 --> 01:21:19.435
The first code was very hard.
This is easy.

01:21:19.539 --> 01:21:22.102
Whoever did this
wanted the cops to get it.

01:21:22.206 --> 01:21:23.984
You ran numbers, too?

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:28.077
- I wasn't always a cop.
- He fractured an occasional law.

01:22:16.465 --> 01:22:20.593
'The horses have now
reached the starting gate.'

01:22:25.974 --> 01:22:28.338
Freeze! Hit the floor!

01:22:28.442 --> 01:22:30.392
Freeze, God damn it!

01:22:32.731 --> 01:22:33.774
1:30.

01:22:41.114 --> 01:22:42.157
1:15.

01:22:53.210 --> 01:22:54.490
30 seconds.

01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.302
Time!

01:23:10.894 --> 01:23:12.638
Goodbye, Mr Cain.

01:23:23.991 --> 01:23:25.938
'...winning it by a nose.

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:29.941
'The General was second
and Marshall's Madness came third.'

01:23:30.046 --> 01:23:32.947
I'm afraid our horse didn't come in.

01:23:33.051 --> 01:23:34.701
Cain's did.

01:23:40.507 --> 01:23:44.042
'The result is now official.
The winner, Johnny's Dilemma...'

01:23:54.271 --> 01:23:57.058
- Police officers!
- Police!

01:24:07.201 --> 01:24:08.778
We're a little late.

01:24:14.374 --> 01:24:17.488
All I can tell you now
is that we are confident

01:24:17.592 --> 01:24:20.865
that we have identified
the Alphabet Bandit.

01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:24.205
The man was shot dead
at the scene this morning

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:26.454
by security guard Jack Stiles.

01:24:26.558 --> 01:24:30.587
In his latest robbery attempt,
the man was fatally wounded.

01:24:30.692 --> 01:24:35.255
So I give you my oath right here
there will be no F crime.

01:24:35.359 --> 01:24:36.719
My own computer team

01:24:36.823 --> 01:24:41.597
personally cracked the Alphabet
Bandit's code this afternoon.

01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:46.016
All of the notes, mind you,
were signed "Carlos", right?

01:24:46.121 --> 01:24:51.020
Carlos. Carlos, which, as you all
know, is Spanish for Charles.

01:24:51.125 --> 01:24:53.273
Do you hear what I'm saying?

01:24:53.377 --> 01:24:55.941
If Cain's the man, where's the money?

01:24:56.045 --> 01:24:57.445
Where's Dent?

01:24:57.549 --> 01:25:00.994
- You said shipping oil equipment.
- But how? Where?

01:25:03.257 --> 01:25:06.536
- Let's put an APB out on Dent.
- For what reason?

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.924
- Hey, where'd you get that?
- What?

01:25:10.389 --> 01:25:12.631
It's coming from there.

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:19.508
Excuse me.
How did the mud get on the horse?

01:25:19.613 --> 01:25:21.804
He was grazing in the pasture.

01:25:21.909 --> 01:25:26.646
- Where's the pasture at?
- There. Dent's oil field.

01:25:37.457 --> 01:25:40.737
Bogomil had that red mud
on his sneakers.

01:25:40.841 --> 01:25:44.576
Maybe he got a tip, he came here
and they tried to waste him.

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:46.576
Who pulled the Alphabet jobs?

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.828
Dent's going broke, OK?

01:25:48.932 --> 01:25:52.041
So he heists some bank,
heists some jewellery,

01:25:52.145 --> 01:25:55.169
then throws this easy code
with Cain's name on it.

01:25:55.273 --> 01:25:58.047
Simple. You frame Cain, kill Cain,

01:25:58.151 --> 01:26:01.591
Cain's the Alphabet killer,
Dent gets away scot-free.

01:26:01.695 --> 01:26:05.636
Why would an oil man risk this,
even if he was broke?

01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:09.809
Dent's not buying oil equipment,
he's buying guns from Thomopolis.

01:26:09.913 --> 01:26:12.565
Probably selling them
in Central America.

01:26:12.670 --> 01:26:14.646
Why not split with the cash?

01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:18.440
Dent buys guns here for a million
and sells them there for 10 million.

01:26:18.544 --> 01:26:21.071
Look at all that oil.

01:26:21.175 --> 01:26:22.792
I don't see oil.

01:26:24.004 --> 01:26:25.463
I see trucks.

01:26:40.437 --> 01:26:42.258
Come on, Billy.

01:26:42.362 --> 01:26:44.592
Billy, what are you doing?

01:26:44.697 --> 01:26:48.432
I've been wanting to wear this
for a while, Sarge.

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:51.891
What, are you nuts?
Christ, Billy, we gotta talk.

01:26:51.996 --> 01:26:53.855
What the hell is this?

01:26:53.959 --> 01:26:56.187
You can never have
too much firepower.

01:26:56.292 --> 01:26:59.204
- Come on!
- Shit.

01:27:15.347 --> 01:27:16.925
Bogomil was here.

01:27:31.864 --> 01:27:34.727
- Hey! You like rap music?
- Yeah.

01:27:34.831 --> 01:27:39.276
I'm from the Rap Coalition of
America. Throw that gun over there.

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:42.318
If you like rap music,
why ain't you smiling?

01:27:42.422 --> 01:27:45.407
- I'm smiling.
- Smile. Let's rap together.

01:27:45.512 --> 01:27:48.782
<i>~ Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo</i>
<i>Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo ~</i>

01:27:48.886 --> 01:27:51.835
<i>~ Say ow!</i>
<i>Ow! ~</i>

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:02.590
Those look like oil pumps to you?

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:05.177
It looks like World War III.

01:28:11.403 --> 01:28:13.057
- Here, Billy.
- What?

01:28:13.161 --> 01:28:15.527
You don't have one of these, do you?

01:28:19.828 --> 01:28:23.485
You guys hang around the back,
I'll check out the front.

01:28:23.589 --> 01:28:24.632
Yeah!

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:47.633
- What are you doing?
- Element of surprise.

01:28:47.737 --> 01:28:50.898
What? What, are you nuts?

01:28:56.532 --> 01:28:59.689
Fool the connecting wire...

01:28:59.793 --> 01:29:02.074
into thinking it's still intact.

01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:08.490
These documents will make your life
much easier. You need to sign them.

01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:12.782
- You still got that thing?
- Shh!

01:29:12.886 --> 01:29:17.876
It's a bad idea. Of all the ideas
you've had, this is the worst.

01:29:29.606 --> 01:29:32.856
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- Trust me.

01:29:49.084 --> 01:29:50.247
Come on, Axel!

01:29:57.509 --> 01:29:59.178
Get him!

01:30:01.597 --> 01:30:03.221
Get your head down!

01:30:08.478 --> 01:30:10.352
From behind!

01:30:22.409 --> 01:30:24.698
"Pull pin."

01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:28.785
- Billy, what are you doing?
- "Extend."

01:30:30.834 --> 01:30:33.198
- "Pull open and..." Wow!
- Billy!

01:30:33.302 --> 01:30:34.754
"Release safety."

01:30:36.465 --> 01:30:37.716
Billy!

01:30:39.176 --> 01:30:41.215
Aim through there, push this.

01:30:53.482 --> 01:30:55.106
Fuck Rambo.

01:30:56.652 --> 01:30:58.940
Get me fucking out of here.

01:31:06.495 --> 01:31:07.943
Cover me.

01:31:08.047 --> 01:31:09.449
Go, Axel!

01:31:41.113 --> 01:31:42.655
Watch it! OK!

01:31:47.035 --> 01:31:49.316
C'mon, let's get the hell
out of here!

01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:50.824
Hold it!

01:31:53.959 --> 01:31:56.445
Stay right there!

01:31:56.549 --> 01:31:57.743
Freeze!

01:32:01.717 --> 01:32:04.172
All right!
Lay your weapons down!

01:32:17.065 --> 01:32:18.942
Mr Foley.

01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:30.070
You involved yourself in business
that doesn't concern you.

01:32:33.207 --> 01:32:34.665
That was a mistake.

01:33:38.146 --> 01:33:39.806
Goodbye, Mr Foley.

01:33:50.159 --> 01:33:51.357
Women.

01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:55.364
Come on, let's go.

01:34:04.464 --> 01:34:06.995
Police! You're under arrest!

01:34:07.099 --> 01:34:09.329
I think they know that, Billy.

01:34:09.433 --> 01:34:12.585
Drop your weapons!
Put your hands on your heads!

01:34:12.689 --> 01:34:14.335
They got their hands up.

01:34:14.439 --> 01:34:17.006
What took you guys so long?

01:34:19.771 --> 01:34:21.636
Shit. We're in trouble now.

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:26.100
Axel's AWOL. We can get out
of this if we keep quiet.

01:34:26.204 --> 01:34:27.432
Don't say anything.

01:34:27.537 --> 01:34:30.476
What the hell have you done here?

01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:34.858
Looks like a goddamn war zone.
What have you done, Taggart?

01:34:34.963 --> 01:34:36.901
We solved the Alphabet crimes.

01:34:37.005 --> 01:34:39.528
Shut up.
Who the hell is talking to you?

01:34:39.632 --> 01:34:43.199
I solved the Alphabet case
in a body bag over an hour ago.

01:34:43.303 --> 01:34:49.205
And you. I don't give a damn who
you're working for. You're in jail.

01:34:49.309 --> 01:34:50.955
- Chief...
- Shut up.

01:34:51.059 --> 01:34:54.210
What are you doing,
bringing a fire fight to my city?

01:34:54.314 --> 01:34:58.462
- You're out of the cop business!
- Will you just listen a minute?

01:34:58.566 --> 01:35:01.923
- You shut your mouth!
- No, God damn it! You shut up!

01:35:02.027 --> 01:35:06.594
This is what the Alphabet crimes
are about... guns! That guy sold them,

01:35:06.699 --> 01:35:11.349
then bought them with stolen money
from Adriano's at his own racetrack.

01:35:11.453 --> 01:35:13.479
He was going to Central America.

01:35:13.584 --> 01:35:16.189
If you'd take your head
out of your ass,

01:35:16.294 --> 01:35:18.689
you'd see we solved the whole thing!

01:35:18.793 --> 01:35:21.530
Lutz, why didn't I know about this?

01:35:21.634 --> 01:35:24.822
Chief Lutz doesn't have
the guts to hear the truth.

01:35:24.926 --> 01:35:28.411
We had to go undercover
with Foley to solve this case.

01:35:28.515 --> 01:35:30.077
You're fired, Taggart!

01:35:30.181 --> 01:35:34.376
- Yeah? Kiss my ass!
- Kiss mine! You're fired, too!

01:35:34.481 --> 01:35:38.295
Lutz, I've had it
with your abusive attitude.

01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:40.378
I'm sorry. I get carried away.

01:35:40.482 --> 01:35:44.423
- You're fired. Do you understand?
- Don't overreact, Ted.

01:35:44.527 --> 01:35:46.970
I want you out of here now.

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:49.347
Get out of here! Fired!

01:35:49.452 --> 01:35:53.307
- You'll regret this, Ted.
- I've regretted it for two months.

01:35:53.411 --> 01:35:56.398
You too. You're out of here.
Will you get out?

01:35:56.503 --> 01:35:58.358
- Are they civilians?
- You bet.

01:35:58.462 --> 01:36:00.856
I'll kick your ass later!

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:03.276
Axel, thank you so much, really.

01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:06.783
I've got a charity meeting
for the homeless for Beverly Hills.

01:36:06.887 --> 01:36:11.163
I'd like to make a donation.
Here's $200 from Sidney Bernstein.

01:36:11.267 --> 01:36:13.917
That's my alias.
I don't like publicity.

01:36:14.021 --> 01:36:17.124
Thank you, Axel...
I mean, Sidney Bernstein.

01:36:17.228 --> 01:36:20.057
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.

01:36:21.977 --> 01:36:24.546
"If you get your head
out of your ass"?

01:36:24.650 --> 01:36:26.594
"Kiss my ass"?

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:29.221
You're getting more
like me every day.

01:36:29.325 --> 01:36:33.446
Next thing you know, you'll have
afros... big dicks and all.

01:36:39.286 --> 01:36:40.329
Axel.

01:36:40.579 --> 01:36:43.148
- You make Chief of Police yet?
- Right.

01:36:43.252 --> 01:36:44.863
You are the new chief?

01:36:44.968 --> 01:36:47.866
Inspector Todd?
Ted Egan, mayor of Beverly Hills.

01:36:47.971 --> 01:36:49.660
As I told your mayor,

01:36:49.764 --> 01:36:54.039
we're very thankful you allowed Foley
to help us with this case.

01:36:54.144 --> 01:36:56.959
According to him,
he's acquired all his skills

01:36:57.063 --> 01:36:58.874
under your expert tutelage.

01:36:58.979 --> 01:37:01.012
Certainly. He's just arrived.

01:37:03.894 --> 01:37:04.937
Hi!

01:37:05.145 --> 01:37:08.220
Expert tutelage?
What the fuck have you been saying?

01:37:08.324 --> 01:37:09.930
Let me talk to him.

01:37:10.034 --> 01:37:12.805
Now that you're done
being a California hero,

01:37:12.909 --> 01:37:14.889
get your ass home to your real job.

01:37:14.994 --> 01:37:18.102
Yeah, I'm leaving now.
My ass left already.

01:37:18.206 --> 01:37:19.815
I got to catch up with it.

01:37:19.919 --> 01:37:21.774
Oh, yes, one other thing,

01:37:21.879 --> 01:37:25.067
your secret partner
Mario Andretti Friedman

01:37:25.171 --> 01:37:27.402
wrecked the goddamn Ferrari.

01:37:27.506 --> 01:37:29.238
Here, you talk to Jeffrey.

01:37:29.342 --> 01:37:33.659
Axel, it wasn't my fault.
There was a bus coming...

01:37:33.763 --> 01:37:36.877
Hello? He hung up. Hello?

01:37:39.555 --> 01:37:41.835
Axel, you don't have to go home now.

01:37:41.939 --> 01:37:45.462
Let's go down to Mexico
and catch another marlin.

01:37:45.566 --> 01:37:47.047
Fishing's too tiring.

01:37:47.152 --> 01:37:50.425
It's back to Detroit for some
old-fashioned street violence.

01:37:50.529 --> 01:37:56.018
Come with me. Your wife left you.
Come hang out. I know a lot of girls.

01:37:56.122 --> 01:37:59.520
- Maureen came back.
- Did she? Congratulations.

01:37:59.625 --> 01:38:02.563
The people you least expected,
they're studs.

01:38:02.667 --> 01:38:05.358
The man's a stud
and we ain't even know it.

01:38:05.463 --> 01:38:09.823
- She couldn't live without you?
- Her mother didn't have cable TV.

01:38:09.928 --> 01:38:13.583
It wasn't no mother's cable TV.
Your cable brought her back.

01:38:15.132 --> 01:38:16.325
I'm off.

01:38:16.429 --> 01:38:18.705
Thanks a lot, Axel.

01:38:18.809 --> 01:38:20.795
Don't thank me. I love you guys.

01:38:23.348 --> 01:38:26.506
- See you around.
- Be cool, man.

01:38:26.610 --> 01:38:29.049
Anything we can do for you?

01:38:29.153 --> 01:38:32.720
Yeah. Take care of my uncle's house
till he gets back.

01:38:32.825 --> 01:38:36.429
Axel, that's not really
your uncle's house, is it?

01:38:36.533 --> 01:38:38.735
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

01:38:41.492 --> 01:38:45.441
What the hell's going on?
Who are you? Who's that black guy?

01:38:46.705 --> 01:38:48.359

<i>~ Oh-oh ~</i>

01:41:25.531 --> 01:41:28.272
<i>~ It's not the curls in your hair ~</i>

01:41:28.376 --> 01:41:31.230
<i>~ It's not your car ~</i>

01:41:31.334 --> 01:41:37.322

01:41:37.426 --> 01:41:42.044
