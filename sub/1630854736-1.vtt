00:30.508 --> 00:33.345
<i>In local news,
rio arriba county sheriff</i>

00:33.378 --> 00:37.182
<i>is still searching</i>
<i>for the forces</i>
<i>that's involved in...</i>

00:37.216 --> 00:38.883
<i>You okay?</i>

00:38.916 --> 00:41.186
Yeah, I'm fine.
You got a problem with something?

00:41.220 --> 00:42.887
Look, I get it.

00:42.920 --> 00:47.526
Most guys get awkward
after the fact.

00:47.559 --> 00:49.328
Look, just drop it.

00:49.361 --> 00:51.230
The wives almost never find out.

00:51.263 --> 00:54.200
That's the last thing
you should be thinking
about right now.

00:54.234 --> 00:56.969
- You paying me or what?
- Every penny.

00:57.002 --> 01:01.039
Here's the thing.
I'm dropping
your ass off out here.

01:01.073 --> 01:03.942
The hell you are!
You said you would
drive me back to town.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.379
You think I'd drop you off
in that fucking skirt

01:06.412 --> 01:09.982
within 50 miles
of the town I live in?
You think I'm fucking nuts?

01:13.853 --> 01:16.022
You fucking asshole.
It's the middle
of fucking nowhere!

01:16.055 --> 01:18.100
You need to get the fuck
out of my car.
Fuck you, bitch.

01:18.124 --> 01:20.093
The fuck?
You fucking promised!
What the fuck?

01:22.396 --> 01:24.298
You're getting the fuck
out of my car!

01:24.331 --> 01:26.833
You little dick
motherfucker!
You fucking promised!

01:26.866 --> 01:28.245
- Get your fucking ass out!
- What the fuck?

01:28.269 --> 01:30.280
- Drive me back, motherfucker!
- Get your sleazy ass...

01:30.304 --> 01:31.871
- No!
- Outta the fucking car.

01:31.904 --> 01:33.274
- Do not fucking touch me!
- Hey!

01:33.307 --> 01:35.809
- Get the fuck off!
- Get your fucking ass off!

01:35.843 --> 01:37.412
- Fuck!
- Get the fuck outta here.

01:37.445 --> 01:39.847
- Stop being a fucking pussy!
- Fuck you, bitch!

01:39.880 --> 01:41.416
- You fucking hussy, bitch!
- Fuck you!

02:07.643 --> 02:08.977
Hello?

02:10.011 --> 02:11.514
Anyone in there?

02:39.943 --> 02:41.945
Sweet.

06:24.646 --> 06:29.150
You're four weeks
overdue, grace.

06:30.385 --> 06:33.154
You know I've been trying
to get ahold of you
for weeks now,

06:33.188 --> 06:36.224
but you don't open the door.

06:36.258 --> 06:38.861
That's just not respectful.

06:38.895 --> 06:41.664
Yeah.
Look, I'm sorry.

06:41.698 --> 06:47.403
It's just, uh,
the payments have been
kind of hard to manage.

06:47.437 --> 06:49.238
- It's been a struggle.
- I don't know.

06:50.707 --> 06:52.241
I don't know.

06:53.242 --> 06:56.579
What are we gonna do?

06:59.483 --> 07:01.285
I was thinking...

07:01.318 --> 07:03.253
And I was hoping
I could pawn
some more stuff.

07:03.287 --> 07:05.923
You're kidding me, right?

07:05.956 --> 07:10.327
Look, I didn't even think
you had anything left
in your apartment.

07:12.329 --> 07:13.864
All right, what do you got?

07:23.708 --> 07:25.710
Well, this is a piece of shit.

07:27.912 --> 07:29.514
It's five gs.

07:31.449 --> 07:34.419
And you're not making payments.

07:34.452 --> 07:35.452
Grace...

07:37.656 --> 07:39.258
What are we gonna do?

07:40.326 --> 07:41.727
Mm.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.763
It seems to me
that you can't pay.

07:45.665 --> 07:46.799
Oh, well...

07:51.237 --> 07:54.306
That's when we can start
getting creative.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.877
I'm a reasonable man, grace.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.352
Motherfuckers!

08:06.987 --> 08:08.622
Those sick motherfuckers!

08:17.631 --> 08:18.865
Fuck!

08:18.899 --> 08:20.902
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

08:40.289 --> 08:42.323
Fill her up.

08:44.760 --> 08:45.828
Hurry up!

08:52.935 --> 08:54.670
- Come on.
- Hurry up.

08:54.703 --> 08:57.740
- Okay, I'm doing it.
I'm doing it!
- Let's go.

08:57.773 --> 08:59.408
Good boy.

09:00.410 --> 09:01.478
Oh, yeah.

09:03.079 --> 09:04.781
I haven't got
all fucking day.
Hurry up.

09:04.814 --> 09:05.949
Okay, okay.

09:06.950 --> 09:09.018
All right. Okay.

09:10.019 --> 09:11.788
All right, good job.

09:12.789 --> 09:13.857
- No, no, no! No!
- Okay.

09:15.492 --> 09:17.293
What are you doing?

09:17.327 --> 09:19.596
- Huh?
- He made me.
Just bad luck, huh?

09:19.629 --> 09:21.565
Are you fucking
out of your mind?

09:21.599 --> 09:23.033
What do you think, soldier boy?

09:23.067 --> 09:25.302
He's a kid.
It was unnecessary!

09:25.336 --> 09:28.706
Well, he should have checked
his fucking horoscope.

09:30.474 --> 09:33.577
No, no. Fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck!

09:33.611 --> 09:34.678
Guys, get out here fast.

09:34.712 --> 09:35.980
Get out here now!

09:37.715 --> 09:39.049
Fuck!

09:55.734 --> 09:58.970
Fuck! Chris left.
Chris fucking left, man.

09:59.004 --> 10:00.372
He's out of here.
He left.

10:00.405 --> 10:01.405
Jesus. Fuck!

10:09.782 --> 10:11.784
Fuck!

10:24.064 --> 10:25.966
You got a car?

10:25.999 --> 10:27.935
Huh?

10:27.968 --> 10:29.403
You're coming with us.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.009
- I got a car.
- Well, let's go.

10:36.043 --> 10:37.110
She's driving.

10:37.144 --> 10:39.847
I didn't sign up for a hostage.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.748
If the three of us
get pulled over
by the cops,

10:41.782 --> 10:44.018
shit goes south real quick.

10:44.052 --> 10:47.422
She's driving, we're low
in the seats. That's it.

10:50.192 --> 10:51.626
Fuck.

11:05.541 --> 11:06.876
You're driving.

11:14.483 --> 11:18.120
Fuck, shit.

11:19.688 --> 11:21.690
Let's go. Go!

11:37.908 --> 11:41.077
Lose the masks.

11:41.111 --> 11:43.547
Wait. No. Please,
I can't see your faces.

11:43.581 --> 11:44.782
It's all right.

11:44.815 --> 11:46.183
I'm fine.

11:46.218 --> 11:47.585
Like that kid was?

11:47.618 --> 11:48.853
Oh, that's if you're lucky.

11:48.886 --> 11:50.855
Do you wanna test your luck?

11:50.888 --> 11:52.757
'Cause, uh, wait.
Hold on.

11:52.790 --> 11:54.859
I got this little game
we could play.

11:54.892 --> 11:56.827
Just please drive.

11:56.861 --> 11:58.796
Or we leave your body
by the side of the road

11:58.829 --> 12:00.998
with a thousand
fucking holes in it.

12:01.933 --> 12:03.969
- Your choice.
- Yeah, what my brother said.

12:05.704 --> 12:06.939
Tie it off.

12:06.972 --> 12:08.607
Where do I tie it?

12:08.640 --> 12:10.509
Above the opening.
Not too tight.

12:12.744 --> 12:14.012
Wait. Where am I going?

12:14.046 --> 12:16.715
It doesn't matter.
Drive the fucking car.

12:44.279 --> 12:45.813
What's the plan, man?

12:45.846 --> 12:48.249
We keep driving
till we figure
our next move.

12:48.283 --> 12:50.517
Can you get that bullet out?

12:50.551 --> 12:52.686
I'll need to look at it first,

12:52.720 --> 12:56.090
see where the entry point is,
see what I'm dealing with.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.926
- That a yes?
- It's what I just said.

13:01.095 --> 13:04.899
Shit.
What the fuck is that?

13:07.969 --> 13:09.205
Roadblock.

13:09.238 --> 13:10.306
What are we gonna do, man?

13:10.339 --> 13:12.607
Start with shutting
the fuck up, Shane.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.276
Make a left here.
Left now!

13:48.011 --> 13:49.046
Make the call.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.148
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

13:51.181 --> 13:54.651
We have no getaway plan.
We have his money.
Make the call.

13:54.684 --> 13:56.053
I said I would call him

13:56.086 --> 13:57.788
- when the job is done.
- The job <i>is</i> done.

13:57.821 --> 14:00.258
Missing soon-to-be-dead
getaway driver,

14:00.291 --> 14:02.326
one hostage? Yeah.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.094
Doesn't sound very done to me.

14:04.127 --> 14:06.298
Right. And whose
fucking fault is that?

14:06.331 --> 14:09.133
Mine? Me? What are you...
I didn't know he was gonna
fucking skirt off

14:09.167 --> 14:11.407
- at the first sign of trouble, man.
- I didn't... - Shh.

14:13.405 --> 14:15.106
You fucking blackmail me.

14:20.912 --> 14:23.215
You got somebody
waiting for you at home?

14:24.416 --> 14:25.651
No.

14:25.684 --> 14:27.019
Nobody, huh?

14:27.052 --> 14:30.290
No. Not anymore.

14:36.662 --> 14:39.332
- Why are you slowing down?
- No, no, no!

14:39.365 --> 14:41.301
No. No, no, no.
Come on, come on. No!

14:42.668 --> 14:44.002
Oh, shit!

14:47.674 --> 14:49.376
The car fucking stopped.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.845
Brilliant observation, retard.

14:51.878 --> 14:53.713
Now, what?

14:53.746 --> 14:55.849
Now, we get out
of the fucking car.

15:39.462 --> 15:41.163
What are you doing?

15:41.196 --> 15:43.999
Well, the car's out.
We don't need her.

15:44.032 --> 15:47.703
I didn't sign up for that.
I don't do civilians.

15:47.737 --> 15:52.476
I do what I have to
to ensure a clean getaway.

15:57.180 --> 15:59.249
You're not doing this
to our hostage.

16:03.953 --> 16:05.688
You're awfully merciful.

16:06.523 --> 16:09.394
Or maybe I just got
enough bad Karma.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.462
Ain't we a couple
of silverbacks.

16:14.499 --> 16:15.766
Look...

16:15.799 --> 16:17.435
We're already fucked.

16:17.468 --> 16:20.737
We keep her alive.
At least we got
some leverage.

16:22.806 --> 16:24.275
You like her, don't you?

16:25.909 --> 16:28.980
Okay.
She's your baggage.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.195
What's over there?

16:44.230 --> 16:45.730
More than what's here.

16:48.867 --> 16:50.769
Fucking walking?

16:50.803 --> 16:52.372
Affirmative.

16:52.405 --> 16:55.040
Unless you got yourself
a bicycle.

16:55.074 --> 16:57.444
You help your brother,
I got the girl and the bag.

17:00.045 --> 17:01.747
Roger that.

17:21.535 --> 17:22.535
Come on.

17:27.308 --> 17:28.410
Fucking slow down.

17:33.382 --> 17:34.383
Fuck.

17:54.903 --> 17:56.406
You didn't try to run.

17:57.607 --> 17:59.007
Where would I go?

18:00.410 --> 18:01.810
Good point.

18:27.638 --> 18:28.905
Fuck.

18:32.109 --> 18:34.111
- Fuck.
- Okay.

18:37.114 --> 18:38.949
Where are you going, man?

18:38.982 --> 18:41.353
Well, to be honest,

18:41.386 --> 18:43.221
probably gonna blow
this guy's head off.

18:43.254 --> 18:45.155
We talked about that.
No more bodies.

18:45.189 --> 18:48.360
That doesn't give us
very many options, does it?

18:48.393 --> 18:50.262
We stay camouflaged.
Hidden.

18:51.464 --> 18:55.967
You've really got yourself
into the wrong line of work,
haven't you?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.503
Listen up, cowboy.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.070
You want your brother fixed up?

18:59.104 --> 19:01.440
Then for now,
we're playing this my way.

19:03.174 --> 19:04.252
We don't have to turn this place

19:04.276 --> 19:08.012
into the fucking
o.K. Corral
unless we have to.

19:08.046 --> 19:09.991
- Both of you,
get in the shadows.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.415
- You don't get to boss
my fucking brother...
- Sit back, kid.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.690
He got hired for a reason.

19:16.723 --> 19:20.159
Three, four hours tops.
Then we're gone.

19:20.192 --> 19:21.261
Let's go.

19:29.703 --> 19:33.408
All right, motherfucker.
Let's see what you got.

19:37.245 --> 19:39.647
What's your name, anyway?

19:39.680 --> 19:40.947
Grace.

19:42.115 --> 19:44.419
Look, grace.
You seem smart.

19:44.452 --> 19:46.621
Here's what gonna happen
when we get in there.

19:46.654 --> 19:50.592
You're gonna do
what I say when I say it.
You'll be fine.

19:50.626 --> 19:54.363
Right. Like those people
at the pawnshop?

19:54.396 --> 19:56.265
I had nothing to do
with how that went down.

19:56.298 --> 19:58.300
Yeah. But you didn't
stop it either.

20:09.411 --> 20:10.479
Hi there.

20:12.615 --> 20:13.683
Hello?

20:13.716 --> 20:15.285
Yeah, I didn't mean
to startle you.

20:16.653 --> 20:18.153
What are you doing here?

20:18.187 --> 20:20.189
Well, we were hoping
you could help us.

20:20.223 --> 20:23.426
Um, our car broke down
a couple of miles back.

20:26.061 --> 20:29.232
- It did?
- Yeah. And, uh...

20:31.535 --> 20:33.169
You wanna call someone?

20:33.203 --> 20:34.705
Well, I talked to my brother.

20:34.738 --> 20:37.308
It's gonna take him
a little while
to come get us.

20:37.341 --> 20:38.542
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

20:38.576 --> 20:40.611
I mean, he said
about three or four hours.

20:40.644 --> 20:43.247
It's just getting
a little chilly out there.

20:45.683 --> 20:47.116
Oh.

20:48.117 --> 20:50.688
I-I don't...
I mean, I'm not...

20:50.721 --> 20:54.726
Are those farmhand houses?
Are those empty or...

20:54.759 --> 20:57.562
Yeah. They're empty.
There's no farmhands
here anymore.

20:57.596 --> 21:00.532
Really?
'Cause we were just...

21:00.565 --> 21:03.100
You know, my wife and I,
we just... we're dead tired.

21:03.133 --> 21:05.135
We just wanted a place
to sit for a few hours,

21:05.169 --> 21:07.171
and we'll get out
of your hair easy.

21:07.204 --> 21:09.741
I don't... I don't think
that's a good idea.
I mean, I...

21:09.774 --> 21:11.577
What's your name, sweetheart?

21:11.611 --> 21:14.280
- Danny.
- Danny.

21:14.313 --> 21:18.351
Danny, look, uh, we're...
It's been a long night.

21:18.384 --> 21:21.287
And... we're just
pretty beat.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.756
I mean, my-my sister,
she's in the hospital,

21:23.789 --> 21:25.324
and we're just trying
to get to her.

21:25.358 --> 21:27.693
And we are just
exhausted. Right?

21:27.727 --> 21:30.496
Look, it would...
It would just be
a few hours.

21:30.530 --> 21:32.375
I mean, you wouldn't even
notice that we're here.

21:32.399 --> 21:35.167
Those rooms, they're...
They're in an awful way.

21:35.201 --> 21:38.170
I mean, we wouldn't
cause you any trouble at all.

21:38.204 --> 21:39.849
- I...
- And we'll be gone
before you know it.

21:39.873 --> 21:41.808
We're quiet as mice.
Really.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.411
Just a few hours.

21:44.444 --> 21:45.779
You won't know we're here.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.382
Okay.

21:48.415 --> 21:50.284
There you go.
Thank you.

21:50.317 --> 21:52.119
Which one should we take?
Are they...

21:52.152 --> 21:53.555
Um, any you like.

21:53.588 --> 21:55.757
- You sure? Okay.
- Okay.

21:55.790 --> 21:58.693
Why are you all alone?
Where's your parents?

21:58.726 --> 22:01.763
Um... my grandpa,
but he's not around.

22:01.796 --> 22:03.431
He's running errands.

22:04.432 --> 22:05.533
Well, thank you again.

22:05.567 --> 22:07.235
A few hours, right?

22:07.268 --> 22:10.371
You got my word.
Have a good night.

22:10.405 --> 22:11.539
Thank you, Danny.

22:24.820 --> 22:27.188
- And?
- We got a room.

22:28.189 --> 22:29.291
Who's in there?

22:29.325 --> 22:31.894
Some kid, lives
with his grandpa.
He's not home.

22:31.927 --> 22:37.132
Hmm. Grandpa comes home early,
we might have a problem.

22:37.166 --> 22:38.802
You know how grumpy old men are.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.437
You wanna help your brother out?

22:40.470 --> 22:42.505
It's your best shot, cocksucker.

22:42.539 --> 22:45.542
Oh. Still got it.

22:46.710 --> 22:48.411
Come on.

22:48.445 --> 22:52.147
Fucking shit.

22:56.420 --> 22:58.889
When the old geezer comes back,

22:58.923 --> 23:00.925
we'll take his car,

23:00.958 --> 23:03.527
send our little hostage
on a nice vacation,

23:03.561 --> 23:05.730
and I'll call the boss.

23:24.783 --> 23:27.352
You gonna fix my dying,
fucking brother or what?

23:33.291 --> 23:35.561
- Oh, fuck,
fuck, fuck!
- Hey! Shh!

23:35.595 --> 23:38.398
Give me
a fucking pillow
or a fucking warning first.

23:38.431 --> 23:40.900
Huh, where is the fun
in that? Hold him.

23:40.933 --> 23:43.569
Hold it. Hold it.
I can feel it.

23:46.806 --> 23:48.908
It's a nine millimeter.
I can get it out.

23:51.577 --> 23:52.779
All right.
I need your help.

23:52.812 --> 23:54.281
I need you to hold him steady.

23:59.386 --> 24:01.865
Sorry about the driver.
I didn't think he'd drive off like that.

24:01.889 --> 24:03.424
Well, you vouched for him.

24:03.457 --> 24:04.491
Yeah.
He's a stand-up guy.

24:04.525 --> 24:07.361
- I thought he was solid.
- Just shut up.

24:07.394 --> 24:08.796
You're being dumb and annoying,

24:08.829 --> 24:11.231
acting like
a big fucking pussy
since you got shot.

24:11.265 --> 24:13.333
Give me your lighter.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.474
He's gonna need
antibiotics fast,
or he's fucked.

24:19.507 --> 24:22.277
Okay. All right,
buddy. Hold on.

24:22.310 --> 24:24.846
- Hold on.
- No! Fuck that!

24:24.879 --> 24:26.514
This is gonna hurt, kid.

24:26.548 --> 24:27.758
- It's gonna hurt a bit.
- Oh, shit!

24:27.782 --> 24:29.317
- Hold him steady.
- I'm trying!

24:29.350 --> 24:31.386
Hey. Stop fucking moving,
or I'll kill you myself.

24:31.419 --> 24:33.321
Take it like a fucking man!

24:33.354 --> 24:35.291
That's the spirit, pal!

24:35.324 --> 24:37.393
It ain't forceps, but...

24:37.426 --> 24:39.862
Fuck!

24:41.530 --> 24:43.365
Don't move.
Don't move.

24:43.399 --> 24:45.401
I got it. I got it.
I got it.

24:46.869 --> 24:49.939
I got it.

24:52.808 --> 24:54.009
You gonna sew him up?

24:56.713 --> 24:58.615
This is gonna be
the painful part.

24:58.648 --> 25:00.684
Fuck you. Fuck you.

25:07.791 --> 25:10.494
He's out.

25:14.531 --> 25:15.776
I haven't seen him cry that much

25:15.800 --> 25:17.401
since his boyfriend dumped him.

25:32.016 --> 25:34.886
He's not dead.
He's just passed out.

25:34.919 --> 25:38.557
- He's my brother.
- Oh, I know.

25:40.926 --> 25:43.395
Will he be all right?

25:43.428 --> 25:44.530
Maybe.

25:45.531 --> 25:46.999
Kid needs meds.

26:02.849 --> 26:06.553
So what were you doing
in that pawnshop anyway?

26:06.586 --> 26:07.921
Why were you in the back?

26:09.789 --> 26:11.424
Doesn't matter.

26:14.828 --> 26:16.797
Almost...

26:20.100 --> 26:21.368
No.

26:39.087 --> 26:40.589
That kid in the barn...

26:41.957 --> 26:43.758
I got a weird feeling.
Did you?

26:43.792 --> 26:45.102
I mean, we were
a bunch of strangers

26:45.126 --> 26:46.995
that just showed up
in the middle of the night.

26:47.028 --> 26:50.065
Yeah, I know.
But still.

26:50.098 --> 26:51.800
Something's wrong.

26:54.769 --> 26:56.973
Surely we can call
your boss now, Alex.

26:58.608 --> 27:00.076
You ran the logistics.

27:00.109 --> 27:02.545
I decide when we call my boss.

27:02.578 --> 27:04.981
Right now, that's not an option.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.950
You gonna let your brother
lose his leg?

27:07.984 --> 27:09.919
Beats the bush and daisies.

27:09.952 --> 27:12.088
It was you that cost him
the leg anyway.

27:12.121 --> 27:13.656
Really?

27:13.689 --> 27:15.625
'Cause I was told
you were a professional.

27:15.658 --> 27:17.928
We're killers, not accountants.

27:17.961 --> 27:20.464
What do you want
from my bedside manner?
A blowjob?

27:20.497 --> 27:23.600
No. I'd take
a little logic
from ya, Alex.

27:23.634 --> 27:26.136
'Cause I'd like to make it
outta here in one piece.

27:28.005 --> 27:30.707
How soon until we can move my
brother?

27:30.741 --> 27:33.510
If we're walking,
a couple hours at least.

27:33.543 --> 27:36.413
If we even
have that. Fuck!

27:37.482 --> 27:39.550
Shit.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.553
<i>About 40 minutes afterward,</i>

27:42.587 --> 27:44.756
<i>and did get in a shootout
with Chris Wright.</i>

27:44.789 --> 27:45.990
- What is it?
- Fuck.

27:46.024 --> 27:48.693
<i>The suspected getaway driver,
he was shot and killed.</i>

27:48.726 --> 27:51.095
Police are hoping to find
this woman

27:51.129 --> 27:53.631
who is said to be
the hostage of the suspects.

27:53.665 --> 27:57.635
Oh, wonderful.

27:57.669 --> 28:00.839
- They haven't made our faces.
- They made hers.

28:00.873 --> 28:02.942
- Hey...
- Hey, hey, sit!

28:02.975 --> 28:04.944
She's a liability.

28:04.977 --> 28:08.480
I thought you ex-military guys
were all about tactics.

28:08.514 --> 28:10.649
This isn't feeling
very tactical to me.

28:10.683 --> 28:13.852
If the cops showed up now,
they'd waste no time
in killing us.

28:13.886 --> 28:15.788
With her here, they won't.

28:15.821 --> 28:19.059
I keep telling ya.
It's called leverage.

28:19.092 --> 28:22.629
You know, I think
he must be
your biggest fan.

28:23.997 --> 28:26.900
All right. Well, we still
gotta deal with the boy.

28:26.933 --> 28:28.802
We're waiting for grandpa,
remember?

28:28.835 --> 28:30.737
That was before we saw the news.

28:30.770 --> 28:33.940
Right now, the kid
could be on the phone,
squealing to the cops.

28:33.974 --> 28:35.575
I'm just gonna
make sure he's not.

28:35.608 --> 28:38.579
You're not touching the boy.

28:38.612 --> 28:41.983
You don't trust me.
You don't even like me.

28:42.016 --> 28:44.218
You're right.
I don't trust you.

28:44.252 --> 28:46.120
And I don't like you.

28:46.153 --> 28:47.855
But you love your brother,
don't you?

28:50.558 --> 28:52.626
But he's gonna be here with me.

28:53.894 --> 28:54.962
So the kid lives.

28:55.796 --> 29:00.002
Scout's honor. I don't blow
the little fucker's head off.

29:00.035 --> 29:02.804
I didn't know
I was on a job
with Mother Teresa.

29:29.333 --> 29:30.867
Hello.

29:35.104 --> 29:37.106
Anybody home?

30:42.843 --> 30:44.644
Oh, fuck.

30:57.958 --> 30:59.092
Shit.

31:06.268 --> 31:09.271
Let's see how deep
this rabbit hole goes.

31:28.358 --> 31:29.358
Hmm.

31:59.756 --> 32:00.857
You see anything?

32:00.890 --> 32:03.694
No. Nothing.

32:06.531 --> 32:08.766
Surprised you trust me
enough to keep watch.

32:10.234 --> 32:12.169
Well, I guess we're in this
together, aren't we?

32:13.871 --> 32:14.939
What does that mean?

32:14.972 --> 32:18.042
It means you and I both know
who we really robbed.

32:18.075 --> 32:19.411
Mm.

32:19.444 --> 32:21.111
Don't forget the murder part.

32:22.214 --> 32:24.450
Is that how this works
for you, hmm?

32:24.483 --> 32:26.251
You go from taking lives
to saving 'em?

32:27.320 --> 32:31.122
When you're an army medic,
you get trained to do both.

32:31.156 --> 32:34.192
Right. Okay.
That explains the watch.

32:34.226 --> 32:35.961
You wear it backwards,
so the crystal face

32:35.994 --> 32:37.463
doesn't reflect
the sunlight, right?

32:38.863 --> 32:39.998
I'm impressed.

32:40.031 --> 32:41.500
Army brat.

32:41.534 --> 32:44.837
I mean, it seems like
a lifetime ago, but, yeah.

32:44.870 --> 32:47.139
Yeah, I was in the rangers,
but, uh,

32:47.173 --> 32:51.177
we'll leave it at that
before I really start bitching.

32:51.210 --> 32:52.279
Worried I'd snitch?

32:53.447 --> 32:55.349
No. We just all have
our own stories

32:55.382 --> 32:57.183
and I don't wanna
bore you with mine.

32:58.217 --> 33:02.255
But whatever you were discussing
with our former friend
in the back of that pawnshop,

33:02.289 --> 33:04.191
it wasn't the weather.

33:05.526 --> 33:08.996
Guess I... I won't bore you
with mine either.

34:02.051 --> 34:04.054
Vinny Van gogh here.

34:39.090 --> 34:41.493
Easy now, kid.
Easy now.

34:41.525 --> 34:44.630
Why don't you slide
those earbuds down for me?

34:46.331 --> 34:47.467
That's it.

34:49.201 --> 34:51.571
- Who are you?
- Oh.

34:51.603 --> 34:56.074
I am the last person
you would ever wanna meet.

34:57.510 --> 35:00.513
Please.
You shouldn't be here.

35:00.546 --> 35:02.582
If it's money, I-I got money.

35:02.615 --> 35:07.321
You can take it.
Just go. Please.

35:07.354 --> 35:11.558
You got yourself a regular,
little funhouse down here, kid.

35:11.592 --> 35:13.893
What else you got around here?

35:16.296 --> 35:17.297
Oh.

35:18.499 --> 35:20.967
Now, I really wanna know.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.969
Please.
This isn't safe.

35:24.003 --> 35:25.239
For who?

35:26.374 --> 35:29.209
Yeah. Sorry.

35:29.243 --> 35:31.245
I'm not that easy.

35:32.347 --> 35:36.484
You gotta wine and dine me
before you try
and fuck me, kid.

35:36.518 --> 35:40.220
Besides, this place
has got me kinda curious.

35:40.254 --> 35:43.957
Please. Go. Just go.

35:43.991 --> 35:46.562
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

35:46.595 --> 35:48.497
Hmm.

35:48.531 --> 35:53.134
- I don't believe you.
- I don't lie.

35:54.537 --> 35:56.338
Grandpa taught me never to lie.

35:56.372 --> 35:58.707
Yeah.

35:59.742 --> 36:00.709
All right. Well...

36:00.743 --> 36:03.077
Let's put
that little theory
to the test.

36:04.613 --> 36:06.115
Start walking.

36:09.753 --> 36:12.254
Look, when he gets back,
you know what that
means for me.

36:12.289 --> 36:14.056
- He's gonna kill me.
- Grace.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.327
You and I both know it.
But I could go right now.
I could leave.

36:17.360 --> 36:20.397
- I can't let that happen.
- Why not?

36:20.430 --> 36:22.442
I could just get outta here.
You'll never see me again.

36:22.466 --> 36:23.509
- You can trust me. Please.
- Look,

36:23.533 --> 36:25.636
I ain't gonna let anything
happen to you, all right?

36:25.670 --> 36:28.372
Right. I don't really need
a white knight right now.

36:28.406 --> 36:30.274
I just need you to let me go.

36:30.308 --> 36:32.376
I can't. I'm sorry.

36:33.210 --> 36:35.011
They're always sorry.

36:35.045 --> 36:36.390
- Where the fuck's my brother?
- Hey!

36:36.414 --> 36:39.450
You put that shotgun down,
junior. He went to check
on the kid.

36:39.484 --> 36:40.661
Bullshit. I heard you two talk,

36:40.685 --> 36:42.195
and you said you were
gonna let her go.

36:42.219 --> 36:43.287
Are you fucking deaf?

36:43.321 --> 36:45.021
- Drop the gun now!
- Fuck you!

36:45.055 --> 36:47.459
Hey, you either believe me
and lower that thing,

36:47.493 --> 36:50.395
or I will put a bullet
right through
your stupid brain.

36:50.429 --> 36:51.563
And I won't miss.

36:56.502 --> 36:59.271
All right. Whatever.
Just fucking...

37:02.608 --> 37:04.141
Kill the lights.

37:04.175 --> 37:05.377
What is it?

37:08.381 --> 37:09.616
It's the kid's family.

37:40.548 --> 37:41.782
What the fuck is that?

37:45.619 --> 37:47.221
Jesus, is that a fucking person?

37:48.557 --> 37:50.257
What is this place?

37:52.159 --> 37:54.429
I knew something was off
about that kid.

37:54.462 --> 37:56.063
Should've trusted my gut.

37:59.467 --> 38:01.068
Please.

38:01.870 --> 38:03.137
You gotta get outta here.

38:04.272 --> 38:06.140
Shut the fuck up.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.421
Whoa!

38:19.922 --> 38:22.291
What are you into, kid?

38:25.661 --> 38:30.132
Are you a little pervert?
Peeping Tom?

38:30.166 --> 38:33.303
I don't know,
because this all seems

38:33.337 --> 38:38.909
like you have a lot more
than stashing daddy's <i>playboys</i>
under your bed.

38:38.942 --> 38:40.644
Whatever it is...

38:41.678 --> 38:46.817
I got a feeling
you won't be calling
the cops on me now, will ya?

38:46.850 --> 38:50.922
Please.
Just for your own sake.

38:50.955 --> 38:53.324
For my own sake?

38:54.859 --> 38:58.563
You see, in life,

38:58.596 --> 39:02.132
we all have
our specialties,
our talents.

39:03.401 --> 39:07.639
Mine, other than torturing

39:07.672 --> 39:09.675
and killing
little fucking kids...

39:10.909 --> 39:15.414
My other one
is making people speak.

39:16.782 --> 39:18.784
And since you are a kid...

39:19.918 --> 39:22.855
I figure we can play
a little game.

39:22.888 --> 39:26.592
You know,
I haven't played this
in a while actually.

39:43.543 --> 39:45.512
One more.

39:50.017 --> 39:52.286
The odds are not good now, kid.

40:11.272 --> 40:12.941
Let's go for a walk.

40:20.348 --> 40:22.350
Where's Alex, man?
He should've been
back by now.

40:22.384 --> 40:23.752
Oh, shit.

40:26.288 --> 40:29.325
- Hey, where are you going?
- To find Alex.

40:30.526 --> 40:34.030
This job isn't done
until he delivers that cash
to his boss.

40:34.063 --> 40:35.898
I'm gonna make sure
that happens.

40:35.932 --> 40:37.776
You don't even know
what you're dealing with here.

40:37.800 --> 40:41.003
No, I don't. I guess
I'm gonna find out.

40:42.672 --> 40:44.507
Keep eyes on her and the bag.

40:44.540 --> 40:46.743
You're in control now.
We got problems.

40:46.776 --> 40:49.277
Look, man. I'm sorry
about my brother.

40:50.681 --> 40:51.882
He's fucking crazy.

40:52.883 --> 40:54.418
Yeah, he is.

42:04.524 --> 42:06.393
Is that gramps?

42:14.001 --> 42:16.871
Let's see. Let's see
if you're serious, huh?

42:23.544 --> 42:26.347
What the fuck? Fuck!

42:28.182 --> 42:30.017
Fuck, Alex.

42:36.158 --> 42:39.361
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Grandpa!

43:01.084 --> 43:04.053
- What the fuck? Fuck!
- Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

43:04.087 --> 43:05.121
What the fuck was that?

43:05.154 --> 43:07.056
Shit.

43:10.593 --> 43:11.862
Piece of shit.

43:12.863 --> 43:15.466
Fuck! Fuck.

43:16.700 --> 43:18.569
Let's just go.
Just get outta here.

43:18.602 --> 43:19.937
It wasn't you.
Just fucking go.

43:19.970 --> 43:21.639
Just go! Just go! Go!

43:21.672 --> 43:23.040
- Just fucking go!
- Where?

43:36.988 --> 43:39.658
Come on, fuck you.
Fuck you!

43:41.226 --> 43:43.962
Fuck you, bastard! Fuck!

43:43.995 --> 43:45.697
God!

43:53.272 --> 43:55.908
Shit. Shit.

44:17.164 --> 44:18.498
Shit!

44:40.822 --> 44:42.924
Help... me.

44:52.567 --> 44:54.036
Grandpa!
No, no, no, no, no!

44:55.971 --> 44:58.011
Please!
She didn't do anything.
It's just the others!

44:59.742 --> 45:01.010
No!

45:20.331 --> 45:23.566
No. No.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.735
Shane! Shane!

45:25.769 --> 45:28.271
Shane! Shane!

45:34.211 --> 45:36.614
I don't want to die.

45:36.647 --> 45:39.850
Shane!
Fuck! Fuck!

45:48.659 --> 45:51.228
Let him go! Hey!
Hey, hey! Listen to me.

45:51.262 --> 45:53.264
I got 100,000 dollars
back in that house.

45:53.298 --> 45:55.801
Whatever you got going on,
you let us go right now,

45:55.834 --> 45:57.869
and you can have it, okay?
Let us go.

45:57.903 --> 45:58.980
Please, please, please, please.

45:59.004 --> 46:01.173
Let us go, you motherfuckers!

46:01.206 --> 46:04.709
You motherfuckers!
You motherfuckers!

46:04.743 --> 46:07.679
Fuck you!
You motherfuckers!

46:07.712 --> 46:09.348
You motherfuckers!

46:56.398 --> 46:57.832
My daughter.

46:59.968 --> 47:01.970
She met a man like you.

47:03.238 --> 47:05.840
He was a monster.

47:05.874 --> 47:08.344
He was evil incarnate.

47:09.210 --> 47:13.748
She stayed with him
for the kids,
if you know what I mean...

47:13.781 --> 47:19.356
Until I came,
and I collected all of them.

47:19.389 --> 47:21.857
And I took them at night.

47:25.761 --> 47:29.466
My daughter's life
was snuffed out

47:29.499 --> 47:32.034
after she was brutalized
and murdered.

47:34.803 --> 47:36.072
Do you know what her crime was?

47:37.274 --> 47:41.077
Her crime was
that she had left him.

47:42.346 --> 47:44.348
I'd gone to Santa fe.

47:44.382 --> 47:48.885
She had stayed back
with my nine-year-old
granddaughter

47:48.919 --> 47:50.854
and my infant grandson.

47:51.656 --> 47:54.824
We learned that this man
was incredibly cruel
to children,

47:54.858 --> 47:56.727
his own flesh and blood.

47:57.962 --> 48:00.432
She had the most
wonderful smile.

48:02.133 --> 48:06.270
I found the man that did it,

48:07.339 --> 48:10.409
and I took my revenge on him.

48:10.442 --> 48:12.977
I did it the way I saw fit.

48:15.380 --> 48:18.917
She was our catch for the night.

48:20.118 --> 48:22.422
But you...

48:22.455 --> 48:24.856
You had to come here,

48:24.890 --> 48:29.094
and ruin everything
I had planned.

48:29.127 --> 48:32.965
We all do what we must
in times like these.

48:36.268 --> 48:41.442
You have ruined
all of your organs

48:41.475 --> 48:46.079
with all of that stuff
that you put into your body.

48:46.112 --> 48:47.814
But...

48:50.083 --> 48:51.751
Your eyes...

48:52.553 --> 48:54.754
Your eyes,

48:56.055 --> 49:00.528
they will fetch
a very high-price.

49:00.562 --> 49:04.131
Vengeance, as you are aware,

49:04.164 --> 49:07.001
is a very expensive business.

49:07.034 --> 49:08.135
Prep him.

49:42.171 --> 49:44.807
You shouldn't struggle.
Your blood pressure's elevated.

49:47.943 --> 49:50.946
Danny... what are you...

49:50.980 --> 49:53.450
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

49:53.483 --> 49:57.253
Well, your body
is in good condition.

49:57.286 --> 49:59.624
The liver's
slightly damaged, but...

49:59.657 --> 50:01.559
Danny? Listen to me.

50:01.592 --> 50:03.528
What is this?
Danny, what is this?

50:03.561 --> 50:07.532
Your body shows signs
of childbirth.

50:07.565 --> 50:09.132
You're a mother.

50:09.166 --> 50:11.234
I've never met a mother.

50:11.268 --> 50:12.637
What do you mean?

50:12.670 --> 50:14.372
What about your mom, Danny?

50:16.139 --> 50:17.575
I don't remember my mom.

50:19.077 --> 50:21.647
A daughter, Danny.
Yeah. Um...

50:21.680 --> 50:24.182
I had a daughter, Danny.

50:24.215 --> 50:25.451
Had?

50:30.221 --> 50:33.091
Danny, what is this?

50:33.124 --> 50:34.926
Danny, what is this place?
What is this?

50:34.959 --> 50:37.161
- I wanted to warn you.
- No.

50:37.195 --> 50:39.031
But I couldn't.

50:39.064 --> 50:41.668
The last time I did,
they were...

50:41.701 --> 50:44.437
He was so angry.

50:44.471 --> 50:45.538
- Who?
- Grandpa.

50:45.572 --> 50:48.307
He does it for me.

50:48.341 --> 50:49.542
Him and Jodi.

50:49.576 --> 50:51.544
Listen, Danny.

50:51.578 --> 50:53.580
Okay.
Look, listen.

50:53.613 --> 50:55.247
Um, I don't understand.

50:55.280 --> 50:58.016
I don't know
what this is, okay?
I-I don't understand.

50:58.050 --> 50:59.919
He helps people.

50:59.953 --> 51:02.088
That's what he does.

51:02.122 --> 51:05.393
He takes what people waste,
and gives it
to more deserving people.

51:05.426 --> 51:07.428
Uh, what do you mean by that?

51:07.461 --> 51:09.363
What-what does he take, Danny?

51:09.397 --> 51:12.065
What does he... Danny,
what does he take, Danny?

51:12.098 --> 51:13.334
Wait. Listen.

51:15.235 --> 51:16.604
Hey! Hey!

51:16.637 --> 51:20.141
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

51:20.174 --> 51:21.476
Hey, can you hear me?

51:21.510 --> 51:23.678
Please!

51:23.712 --> 51:25.313
God, no,
what did they do to him?

51:25.347 --> 51:30.184
Can you hear me? Hey! Hey!

51:51.072 --> 51:52.375
Oh, fuck.

51:53.443 --> 51:55.745
- I'm sorry.
- No.

51:55.778 --> 51:58.481
I really am.
You seem nice.

51:58.514 --> 52:00.016
Because I am nice.

52:00.049 --> 52:02.419
Danny, it's because
I am nice. 'Cause I am...

52:02.453 --> 52:04.721
I am a nice person.
Just... what does he take?

52:04.755 --> 52:07.658
What does...
What is this place?
Just talk to me, please.

52:07.691 --> 52:09.959
Just tell me
what's going on here, okay?

52:11.361 --> 52:15.599
- No. Danny, just tell me.
- I asked him, begged him.

52:15.632 --> 52:18.201
- Look at me, Danny.
- Said not to hurt you.

52:18.234 --> 52:20.304
You don't deserve to be hurt.

52:20.338 --> 52:21.473
He agreed to that, at least.

52:23.207 --> 52:26.043
No. No, no, no.
Danny. Hey.

52:26.076 --> 52:27.712
Hey, Danny!

52:27.745 --> 52:30.582
No.

52:35.085 --> 52:37.622
Luna. Luna.

52:37.655 --> 52:40.793
My daughter's name was Luna.
It's been three years now.

52:40.826 --> 52:42.394
She died?

52:45.831 --> 52:50.402
Look, i-i...
I lost myself, okay?

52:50.436 --> 52:52.605
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

52:52.638 --> 52:55.407
But, Danny, I am trying.
I am trying here, okay?

52:55.441 --> 52:57.242
I'm trying, please, Danny.

52:57.275 --> 52:59.678
- He'll make it quick.
- No, no, Danny. No!

52:59.712 --> 53:02.314
Danny! Danny!

53:07.420 --> 53:09.188
He ain't coming back.

53:10.256 --> 53:12.224
What is this place?
This place.

53:12.258 --> 53:14.628
If I knew, I'd tell ya.

53:14.661 --> 53:16.563
And the others?

53:16.596 --> 53:18.765
Haven't seen 'em.

53:18.798 --> 53:21.301
We gotta get the fuck
outta here now,

53:21.335 --> 53:22.403
or we're done.

53:23.437 --> 53:24.672
Okay.

53:56.270 --> 54:00.375
I'm coming.
I'm coming. Fucking...

54:00.409 --> 54:02.144
We gotta get outta here.
Please.

54:02.177 --> 54:04.112
I got it. I got it.
I'm coming.

55:28.735 --> 55:30.103
Try... try to...

55:30.137 --> 55:32.697
- Try to just pull it!
Just try to pull it.
- Hold on. I'm coming.

55:35.942 --> 55:38.244
- It's going too far. Please.
- I can't pull it.

55:38.277 --> 55:40.222
- Please, please, please.
- I gotta snap the fucking...

55:40.246 --> 55:41.691
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Hold on. Hold on!

55:41.715 --> 55:43.685
Hold on.

55:43.718 --> 55:45.520
- Quickly.
- I got it.

55:45.553 --> 55:47.798
- I'm gonna snap it.
- Okay, okay, okay.
Just do it. Just do it.

55:47.822 --> 55:49.633
- Please. Please.
- Almost got it.
Almost got it.

55:49.657 --> 55:51.526
- I'm gonna snap
the fucking thing.
- Okay.

55:54.862 --> 55:56.296
Fuck you!

55:58.900 --> 56:02.003
Wait. Hey, one second.
Please. No, no, no!
Hey! Stop!

56:02.036 --> 56:03.438
Fucking wait!

56:26.429 --> 56:27.564
Alex?

56:28.832 --> 56:30.934
What the hell?

56:30.967 --> 56:33.336
They took my fucking eyes?

56:33.369 --> 56:35.405
Alex, where's Shane?

56:35.438 --> 56:37.707
It's fucked.

56:37.741 --> 56:39.542
It's fucked.

56:41.811 --> 56:42.946
Fucking crazy person.

56:42.979 --> 56:45.649
What are you fucking
monsters doing? Huh?

56:45.683 --> 56:47.752
You motherfuckers.

56:47.785 --> 56:49.887
You motherfuckers!

56:51.889 --> 56:55.593
Fetch the girl. Now.

57:00.698 --> 57:02.566
Mm. Mine.

57:02.600 --> 57:04.602
I have no need for his body.

57:07.506 --> 57:09.441
- Play.
- Hmm.

57:09.474 --> 57:12.644
I believe you deserve
the reward.

57:14.546 --> 57:16.882
Have fun, my dear.

57:16.915 --> 57:18.650
Hmm.

57:23.021 --> 57:27.560
Fuckers! Motherfuckers!

57:29.395 --> 57:30.830
Alex!

57:30.863 --> 57:32.532
Cody!

57:33.533 --> 57:35.535
Where the fuck did you go?

58:00.460 --> 58:01.795
He's ready for you.

58:02.930 --> 58:04.598
Danny, look.

58:04.631 --> 58:06.568
Danny, you don't have
to do this, okay?

58:06.601 --> 58:08.670
Whatever's happened
in the past, it's okay.

58:08.703 --> 58:09.904
It's okay.
You can stop this.

58:11.706 --> 58:14.008
So many people have been hurt.

58:14.042 --> 58:15.977
It's okay.

58:16.010 --> 58:19.747
You can stop this. Please.
Please stop it, Danny.

58:19.781 --> 58:21.683
- Please.
- We have to go.

58:24.018 --> 58:25.921
No, Danny. No.

58:28.591 --> 58:31.894
Please. Fuck.

58:31.927 --> 58:34.630
Danny...

58:38.868 --> 58:40.469
We can run away.

58:42.605 --> 58:44.607
- What?
- Yeah.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.176
Yeah, you and me
together. We...

58:46.209 --> 58:48.712
We could leave
this place together,
you know?

58:48.745 --> 58:50.614
You know I can't do that.

58:50.647 --> 58:53.750
Yes. You can, Danny.
Yes, you can.

58:53.783 --> 58:54.784
Wait...

59:17.975 --> 59:19.043
You still with me?

59:20.544 --> 59:21.846
I'm with ya.

59:33.692 --> 59:36.662
Very good.
Very good.

59:38.764 --> 59:40.632
Look. Look, you don't have
to do this. Okay?

59:40.666 --> 59:43.168
I know I don't have to.

59:43.201 --> 59:45.971
Organ harvesting, right?

59:46.004 --> 59:47.941
That's what this shit is.

59:47.974 --> 59:51.110
I save people's lives.

59:51.144 --> 59:55.715
Not like you,
who wastes the gifts
that you've been given.

59:55.748 --> 59:58.251
But not in my hands.

59:58.284 --> 01:00:02.655
What gives you the right
to decide who gets to live
and who dies? Hmm?

01:00:05.224 --> 01:00:08.262
Somebody made that choice
for my daughter

01:00:08.295 --> 01:00:10.230
many years ago.

01:00:11.265 --> 01:00:12.800
Danny's mother.

01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:16.203
Don't listen to him, okay?
Don't. Look at me.

01:00:16.236 --> 01:00:19.974
Now, I make the choice.

01:00:20.007 --> 01:00:21.909
The good live.

01:00:21.942 --> 01:00:26.513
They live using the organs
from scum like you,

01:00:26.547 --> 01:00:28.083
who would do nothing
but waste them.

01:00:28.116 --> 01:00:29.951
Bullshit.

01:00:31.119 --> 01:00:33.655
It's bullshit,
your whole fucking plan.

01:00:35.557 --> 01:00:36.691
Tell me.

01:00:37.826 --> 01:00:42.964
Have you ever known
how long it takes

01:00:42.998 --> 01:00:47.102
for somebody who's waiting
for a new organ?

01:00:48.771 --> 01:00:50.906
Seven years.

01:00:51.807 --> 01:00:55.077
Most people have died
before they get them,

01:00:55.111 --> 01:00:59.982
when one murderer,
one drug addict

01:01:00.016 --> 01:01:04.987
could save six good people.

01:01:05.021 --> 01:01:07.857
You think you're
fucking god, don't you?

01:01:10.193 --> 01:01:13.296
No. No, I don't think
I'm god.

01:01:14.432 --> 01:01:18.168
I think I know
what we have to pay
for our sins.

01:01:18.201 --> 01:01:22.072
And it should be
in flesh and blood.

01:01:22.105 --> 01:01:24.608
No, you're a sick, old man.

01:01:24.641 --> 01:01:26.209
That's what you are.

01:01:26.243 --> 01:01:28.645
You do what you want with me.

01:01:28.679 --> 01:01:30.882
You let her go.
You hear me?

01:01:30.915 --> 01:01:32.050
You let her go!

01:01:32.083 --> 01:01:34.118
Her?

01:01:36.154 --> 01:01:38.256
Your womb

01:01:38.289 --> 01:01:43.861
will give a child to someone...

01:01:46.297 --> 01:01:50.569
Who will be a good mother.

01:01:51.904 --> 01:01:53.605
And what's your cut, huh?

01:01:53.639 --> 01:01:56.241
Well, you know,

01:01:58.343 --> 01:02:02.314
we all want to make
a living, don't we?

01:02:02.348 --> 01:02:05.984
Yeah, exactly. Fuck.

01:02:28.908 --> 01:02:30.177
What do you want?

01:02:30.211 --> 01:02:32.313
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

01:02:46.694 --> 01:02:47.761
The fuck?

01:02:49.763 --> 01:02:50.966
I can move.

01:03:04.312 --> 01:03:05.780
I get it.

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:08.884
Now.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.357
You wanna play some games.

01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:18.294
All right.

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:23.299
Let's play
some motherfucking games.

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.173
Fuck.

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:43.820
Yeah. I like to play.

01:03:48.393 --> 01:03:50.395
You wanna play rough, huh?

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:09.847
You wanna play some games,
you fucking freak?

01:04:11.115 --> 01:04:12.485
Huh?

01:04:12.519 --> 01:04:14.220
Oh!

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.928
Oh, you're a big girl, huh?

01:04:57.865 --> 01:04:59.368
You mute bitch.

01:05:15.083 --> 01:05:16.084
Danny.

01:05:17.152 --> 01:05:18.554
Music, please.

01:05:33.336 --> 01:05:35.506
Danny, look.

01:05:37.006 --> 01:05:38.475
You motherfucker!

01:05:39.942 --> 01:05:41.110
Fuck you.

01:05:41.144 --> 01:05:42.945
It doesn't have to be
this way, okay? Listen.

01:05:42.979 --> 01:05:44.314
It doesn't have to be like this.

01:05:44.347 --> 01:05:45.616
Danny, look at me.

01:05:45.649 --> 01:05:47.183
Hey, Danny.

01:05:47.216 --> 01:05:49.252
Don't listen to her, son.

01:05:49.285 --> 01:05:51.220
Don't listen.

01:05:51.254 --> 01:05:53.924
It's all lies.

01:05:55.292 --> 01:05:57.895
Fuck.

01:06:30.962 --> 01:06:32.163
Fuck you.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.267
Fucking pig.

01:06:48.648 --> 01:06:52.586
Oh, fuck you,
you stupid old man!

01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:57.924
Excellent.

01:06:57.958 --> 01:07:00.628
Now, the fun begins.

01:07:10.471 --> 01:07:13.006
Grandpa!

01:07:13.039 --> 01:07:16.244
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Grandpa, you okay?

01:07:16.277 --> 01:07:18.380
You!

01:07:54.082 --> 01:07:55.553
It's a waste of a body!

01:08:04.294 --> 01:08:05.629
Jesus Christ.

01:08:21.412 --> 01:08:22.747
Let me in!

01:08:26.484 --> 01:08:27.519
Okay.

01:08:27.551 --> 01:08:29.353
- I can't move.
- Come on.

01:08:29.386 --> 01:08:30.522
I can't feel my legs.

01:08:31.622 --> 01:08:32.700
That won't hold her off
for long.

01:08:32.724 --> 01:08:34.759
Come on. There must be
something you can do, okay?

01:08:34.792 --> 01:08:37.261
Can you...

01:08:37.295 --> 01:08:39.365
Check the drawers.
Drawers here.

01:08:39.398 --> 01:08:42.033
See if you can find
a surgical stapler.

01:08:42.067 --> 01:08:45.203
What have you done?
What have you done?

01:08:45.237 --> 01:08:47.272
Danny, come on. All right?
I'm not fucking dying.

01:08:47.305 --> 01:08:49.207
If I'm going out,
I'm going on my own terms.

01:08:49.241 --> 01:08:51.544
Oh, fuck.
She'll kill all of us!

01:08:51.577 --> 01:08:55.481
All right, then you're gonna
help me get us out of here.
Okay? Come on!

01:08:55.515 --> 01:08:56.817
I can't.

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:00.596
I can't... and you go...
I don't know.

01:09:00.621 --> 01:09:03.756
Kid, you're getting her
the fuck outta here, okay?

01:09:05.759 --> 01:09:07.326
That's it.
Come here.

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:09.763
Bring it over here.
Let me see. Let me see.

01:09:09.796 --> 01:09:11.698
- Okay.
- That's it.

01:09:11.732 --> 01:09:14.332
All right. It's simple.
Works just like a stapler.

01:09:14.368 --> 01:09:16.571
You're gonna push the edges
of my skin together.

01:09:16.604 --> 01:09:17.604
Okay.

01:09:18.573 --> 01:09:20.642
- Ready?
- Yeah. Go for it.

01:09:30.585 --> 01:09:32.819
Good.

01:09:32.854 --> 01:09:36.089
Follow. Nice.

01:09:36.122 --> 01:09:37.725
Good. Keep going.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.862
Great.

01:09:39.895 --> 01:09:41.796
Okay. Now, help me
get him up, okay?

01:09:41.830 --> 01:09:44.299
- No, you can't carry me.
It's not gonna work.
- But I can try.

01:09:44.332 --> 01:09:46.334
God, fuck!

01:09:46.368 --> 01:09:48.804
Is there another way
out of here?

01:09:48.837 --> 01:09:50.171
We gotta go!

01:09:50.203 --> 01:09:53.107
Okay. Well, I'm not gonna
just fucking leave him,
Danny, okay?

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:55.611
You're leaving me.
I'm gonna buy you some time.

01:09:55.644 --> 01:09:57.146
Grab his gun.

01:09:57.179 --> 01:09:58.782
Get his gun.
You're gonna leave.

01:10:08.658 --> 01:10:10.594
All right.
You see the needles?

01:10:10.627 --> 01:10:11.828
Yeah. There they are.

01:10:11.861 --> 01:10:13.597
It should be adrenaline.

01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:15.832
You gotta pump it
right into me, okay?

01:10:15.865 --> 01:10:17.133
Maybe it'll help me move.

01:10:17.167 --> 01:10:18.447
- Give me some strength.
- Where?

01:10:19.837 --> 01:10:22.506
Right where my heart is.
You good with that?

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.140
- Okay.
- Do it!

01:10:26.477 --> 01:10:28.211
- We have to go.
- Come on.

01:10:31.949 --> 01:10:34.652
Go. Now, go!

01:10:34.685 --> 01:10:36.152
I don't even know your name.

01:10:36.186 --> 01:10:37.623
Cody.

01:10:37.656 --> 01:10:39.558
- Okay. Cody.
- Get out.

01:10:40.792 --> 01:10:41.827
Okay.

01:10:56.742 --> 01:10:58.745
Okay. Okay.

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.248
How's that, huh?

01:11:36.684 --> 01:11:39.821
Fuck!

01:13:21.594 --> 01:13:22.595
Fuck.

01:13:23.596 --> 01:13:25.465
Go!

01:13:46.086 --> 01:13:47.421
Help me with this!

01:15:14.045 --> 01:15:16.147
Danny! Run, run! Danny!

01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:17.949
Run! Go! Now!

01:16:54.083 --> 01:16:55.251
Please...

01:17:10.734 --> 01:17:11.802
Danny?

01:17:15.205 --> 01:17:16.774
Danny!

01:17:23.247 --> 01:17:24.783
Danny!

01:17:27.986 --> 01:17:30.655
Danny!

01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:34.626
Danny, Danny!

01:17:34.659 --> 01:17:36.694
- Danny! Danny!
- No!

01:17:40.231 --> 01:17:42.067
Danny!

01:17:44.770 --> 01:17:46.172
No! No!

01:18:18.038 --> 01:18:20.040
My brother...

01:19:55.408 --> 01:19:56.475
Hey.

01:19:59.377 --> 01:20:02.415
Okay, okay, okay.
Come on. Come on.

01:20:02.448 --> 01:20:03.949
Come on.

01:21:06.949 --> 01:21:08.951
Where do we go from here?

01:21:10.286 --> 01:21:11.387
No idea.

01:21:14.957 --> 01:21:16.225
Wanna find out?
