WEBVTT

00:24.190 --> 00:26.192
At least I didn't drink.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.193
Good for you.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.946
Bowden, what the fuck?

00:56.222 --> 00:58.391
Okay, I mean, that's--that's
my red glove with dead bodies,

00:58.475 --> 00:59.684
but that psych evaluation?

00:59.768 --> 01:01.603
Those are not my answers.
I didn't say any of that.

01:01.686 --> 01:04.564
-It makes me sound insane.
-Wow. Yeah, oh my God.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.317
The double, the frame job,
this file...you look guilty.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.819
This is Bangkok déjà vu.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.321
It's like
the good-old-days shit.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.614
God, was I really like you?

01:12.697 --> 01:14.157
And by the way,
I don't know what's in the file,

01:14.240 --> 01:15.450
which means neither do you.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.202
Well, I know you fucked
your handler last night.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.037
Look, it's a better distraction
than Feliks.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.330
Oh, sorry--Buckley.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.623
Why would you bring
that name up to me, okay?

01:21.706 --> 01:23.750
He's a fucking psychopath
that lied and used me.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.794
He's not some sort of bullshit,
quippy anecdote.

01:25.877 --> 01:29.005
Easy, okay? I'm saying Benjamin
is a classier distraction.

01:29.088 --> 01:32.342
Plus, I'm not the one bringing
stuff up in here, am I?

02:04.040 --> 02:06.125
Okay.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.293
Dot. Oh!

02:07.377 --> 02:08.837
What are you doing here?

02:08.920 --> 02:10.672
It's the CIA. I work here.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.173
What are you doing here?

02:12.257 --> 02:14.384
I owe--I owed Benjamin
a debrief on Berlin

02:14.467 --> 02:16.386
and he said to just
stop by the office any time

02:16.469 --> 02:17.637
I was in the neighborhood
and I was in the neighborhood

02:17.720 --> 02:19.222
-but he wasn't in his office.
-Oh, wow.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.724
It's Westwood. I feel like no
one's ever in the neighborhood.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.644
Um, Cassie, I realize
what happened in Berlin

02:24.727 --> 02:26.771
and us not being able
to tell you everything,

02:26.855 --> 02:28.231
that must be hard.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.275
And I know you don't want
to see a counselor,

02:30.358 --> 02:31.693
but you seem a little on edge.

02:31.776 --> 02:32.819
Oh.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.988
So if you need to talk
to someone,

02:35.071 --> 02:37.073
you've got my number.
That's what it's for.

02:37.156 --> 02:38.074
Oh, my God,
thank you so much.

02:38.157 --> 02:39.158
I--I really am fine.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.202
All this stuff
that you're seeing,

02:41.286 --> 02:42.954
there is an explanation,
but that's for another time

02:43.037 --> 02:44.622
'cause I have to go meet
somebody now.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.332
So I'm just going to make sure
I get in here.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.042
So, thank you.
It's very kind of you.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.169
I'll probably use it.
Thank you so much.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.350
Oh, Jesus.

03:06.185 --> 03:08.771
Why didn't you just show her
the fucking file,

03:08.855 --> 03:10.356
you stupid fucking idiot?

03:10.440 --> 03:12.734
Fucking stupid. I can't...

03:12.817 --> 03:14.527
Oh, my God.

03:14.611 --> 03:15.570
Fuck.

03:20.199 --> 03:21.868
Hi. Shane.
Okay, you told me to call you

03:21.951 --> 03:23.286
when I need help
and I need help.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.580
I'm calling you
from my very small car

03:25.663 --> 03:27.248
that is feeling more
claustrophobic by the moment.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.625
Why did I get such a tiny car?

03:28.708 --> 03:30.501
I don't understand.
I need your help.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.463
Okay, Cassie, okay.
I'm listening.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.131
I'm just going to say it.
I'm just gonna fucking say it.

03:35.214 --> 03:36.466
Someone is impersonating me.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.301
I know it. They--they are
doing very bad things.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.969
They stole my identity.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.471
I am telling you and I think,

03:41.554 --> 03:43.181
I think they're with the CIA

03:43.264 --> 03:44.599
or they know someone at the CIA

03:44.682 --> 03:46.309
or there's something
going on there.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.810
I literally don't know
what to say.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.312
Did you hear
about the two CIA analysts

03:49.395 --> 03:50.563
that got killed at Echo Park?
You heard about that, right?

03:50.647 --> 03:52.482
I didn't know
they were CIA analysts

03:52.565 --> 03:54.150
and you shouldn't know
that, either.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.486
I have proof that those killings

03:56.569 --> 03:58.404
are connected
to the Berlin bombing,

03:58.488 --> 03:59.989
and they're linked
by these slides

04:00.073 --> 04:01.699
in this View-Master
that was left in my suitcase.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.076
It's like this toy

04:03.159 --> 04:04.369
and there's these slides
on there, and...

04:04.452 --> 04:05.453
Yeah.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.833
-Hello?
-Okay. That last part?

04:10.917 --> 04:14.420
Look, just lay low
until I can see

04:14.504 --> 04:15.755
what I can dig up
before training today.

04:15.838 --> 04:16.965
What--what training?

04:17.048 --> 04:18.007
What do you mean?
What do you mean?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.259
The mandatory
Imperial Atlantic

04:20.343 --> 04:22.428
continuing qualification
training.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.013
Cassie, we are still
flight attendants.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.308
Oh, fuck. That's today? Ugh!

04:27.392 --> 04:29.602
Look, just lay low and--
and--and let me see

04:29.686 --> 04:31.521
what I can dig up and bring--
bring that View-Master thing.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.357
It might contain trace evidence,
of what I do not know.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.110
You sound crazy,
but doesn't mean you're wrong.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.946
I don't want you having
another panic attack, so...

04:40.029 --> 04:41.114
-bring it.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.073
Okay. One more thing--

04:48.955 --> 04:50.957
Okay,
just so I'm crystal clear.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.085
You photographed
a classified CIA document

04:54.168 --> 04:56.129
after you fucked your boss
in his office.

04:56.212 --> 04:57.797
Okay, so everything
you're gonna say,

04:57.880 --> 05:00.216
I've thought like 7,000 times,
so we're good.

05:00.299 --> 05:02.010
In fact, I actually would like
to grab a Brillo pad

05:02.093 --> 05:04.262
and scrub my body
until there is just bone left.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.014
I don't know why I did it.
I don't know why I did it!

05:06.097 --> 05:07.098
Okay, okay. You know what?

05:07.181 --> 05:08.474
Just chill.
We're gonna breathe.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.226
If you didn't sleep
with your handler, Benjamin,

05:10.310 --> 05:11.561
we wouldn't have these files.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.229
So it's not that bad,
if you look at it like that.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.230
-That's very true.
-Right?

05:14.313 --> 05:16.274
God, I just want one drink.

05:16.357 --> 05:17.567
Cass, don't say that.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.193
I said it 'cause I mean it.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.404
I mean it. I will
always mean it, okay?

05:21.487 --> 05:22.739
-Okay.
-Sorry.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.574
That is the reality
of my life right now.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.908
Okay? Do you under--I'm sorry.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.077
You guy--
You guys are...amazing.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.620
This stuff makes me
look insane, okay?

05:29.704 --> 05:31.914
This is--this is nuts.
"Narcissistic delusions,

05:31.998 --> 05:34.083
borderline sociopathic
tendencies?" Come on.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.293
"Needs constant praise."

05:36.502 --> 05:37.587
That's probably--
that's probably true.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.796
But that's not me.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.465
Maybe that's how the CIA
wants you to be seen,

05:40.548 --> 05:41.466
like in a
"Manchurian Candidate" way.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.884
You know what?

05:42.967 --> 05:44.844
The most that these files
can do is paint the picture

05:44.927 --> 05:46.429
that you could be a killer.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.389
-That is a very big difference.
-Yeah, right.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.849
And these security stills
are totally grainy, so.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.768
Exactly.
Also they're time-coded

05:51.851 --> 05:52.977
and they were taken
when you were in Iceland.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.854
No, the CIA can pretty
much scrub anything--

05:54.937 --> 05:56.647
timecodes, CCTV footage,

05:56.731 --> 05:58.149
any alibi statements
from Iceland.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.111
Okay, another
little fun fact, um,

06:02.195 --> 06:04.197
that is my missing red glove
from Berlin

06:04.280 --> 06:06.199
at the Echo Park crime scene.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.825
I hate to say this,
but whoever is doing this to you

06:07.909 --> 06:09.160
is, um, killing it.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.745
So my friend at the CIA

06:10.828 --> 06:13.372
said there still could be trace
evidence on the View-Master,

06:13.456 --> 06:16.334
and that is what I'm literally
living for right now, so...

06:17.960 --> 06:19.462
Um...

06:19.545 --> 06:20.922
-What, what, what, what?
-Yeah.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.424
That couple that broke in,
they went through everything.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.343
They went through
a lot of stuff

06:25.426 --> 06:26.928
and they took the View-Master.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.306
Oh, my God. Okay.

06:30.389 --> 06:33.184
I have to go to training.
Can't wait. Gotta go.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.062
Marco.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.730
Hi, you're here. Hey.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.190
Why aren't you
answering my calls?

06:40.525 --> 06:43.152
Um, I--Babe, I have
a really good reason.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.821
I just--um,
can we talk about it later?

06:44.904 --> 06:45.988
I have a work thing
that I have to get to, so...

06:46.072 --> 06:48.533
There's a lot
of work things lately.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.451
Yeah, I know. That's right.

06:50.535 --> 06:51.744
I love you.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.454
There's clearly something
going on with us.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.914
We were talking about you
meeting my daughter--

06:54.997 --> 06:57.959
Okay. Listen, um,
there is something going on,

06:58.042 --> 06:59.585
but with me, with me,

06:59.669 --> 07:02.505
and I want to tell you things
and I--and I feel like I can,

07:02.588 --> 07:04.090
but I actually feel like
I can't tell you this thing.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.551
-So I really do have to go.
-Look, you're right.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.553
You can absolutely
tell me anything.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.596
Okay. Annie, did you say
that you needed--

07:10.680 --> 07:12.140
She didn't say anything,
Cassie.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.225
How can we start a life
together if you don't--

07:14.308 --> 07:16.394
Oh, no, no, no. No, no,
you don't--you don't want to--

07:16.477 --> 07:18.146
Marco, you do not want
to start a life with me.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.147
Trust me.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.148
You're not doing
a very good job

07:20.231 --> 07:21.399
at evading me with excuses.

07:21.482 --> 07:22.775
Okay, I, honestly--
I do have a work thing.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.485
That's--that's it.
And if I don't go now--

07:24.569 --> 07:26.279
I try very hard
to be optimistic.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.822
It's an important part
of my recovery.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.699
Marco, I understand that you
don't get what's going on here.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.409
You really have to do
better than "a work thing now"

07:31.492 --> 07:32.702
because I don't believe you.

07:32.785 --> 07:33.953
I slept with someone else.
Okay?

07:38.416 --> 07:39.709
Oh, my God.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.797
Um, I didn't mean for it
to come out like that.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.591
I didn't mean to say
that out loud. I'm so--

07:50.052 --> 07:52.346
Huh. Another work thing?

07:52.430 --> 07:53.890
No, this is my sponsor,
and I need to--

07:53.973 --> 07:56.517
Oh, you don't get to play
the AA card, not with me!

07:56.601 --> 07:57.643
Just...

07:59.896 --> 08:00.938
Fuck.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.025
Just tell me what happened.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.195
I don't know,
I guess I, um...

08:10.156 --> 08:11.908
I guess I...

08:11.991 --> 08:13.910
I guess
I forgot about you.

08:16.495 --> 08:17.455
Wow.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.667
Okay.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.419
Wow.

08:23.502 --> 08:24.879
I could get over the cheating.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.422
Adults fuck up,
but that last part...

08:26.505 --> 08:29.258
Yeah, that's, um,
that's too much.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.801
Um, my life is completely

08:30.885 --> 08:32.011
spinning out of control
right now,

08:32.094 --> 08:33.679
and I do love you
and I'm really trying--

08:33.763 --> 08:34.931
So am I.

08:35.014 --> 08:38.142
Okay? I'm trying so hard,
Cassie, but you're...

08:44.357 --> 08:46.150
My daughter would have
absolutely loved you.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.362
I know I did.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.366
Bye, Cassie.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.991
Okay.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.201
I see you pulled
an all-nighter.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.828
-How are you holding up?
-Yeah, losing anyone

10:20.911 --> 10:22.496
is brutal for everyone.

10:22.580 --> 10:26.208
-So, I'm fine.
-So, any theories

10:26.292 --> 10:28.836
spring to mind
during your all-nighter?

10:28.919 --> 10:30.296
Nothing that
I'm ready to discuss.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.256
Well, I've been doing
my own homework

10:32.340 --> 10:34.550
and it's starting to feel to me
like an inside job.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.052
Oh, how so?

10:36.135 --> 10:37.636
Let me dig
a little deeper first.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.765
I came in here for a reason.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.725
What was it? Oh, I know.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.185
Why did I see Cassie Bowden

10:44.268 --> 10:46.979
sneaking out of your office
this morning, disheveled?

10:47.063 --> 10:49.607
Well, I don't know.
I must have missed her.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.108
Well, she was in the hallway,
so I guess

10:51.192 --> 10:53.152
she could have been
coming out of any office.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.320
My mistake.

11:09.668 --> 11:11.629
Oh. Carol!

11:11.712 --> 11:12.838
Did you just body check me?

11:12.922 --> 11:15.966
Oh, no!
I didn't even see you there.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.260
You didn't even register to me.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.428
And today's a safety day.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.639
Shame on me.
Isn't that terrible?

11:27.311 --> 11:28.938
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.523
You look like
you've been crying.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.858
Well, let's see.
Um, Marco just dumped me

11:32.942 --> 11:36.237
and there is a crazy human
in the world imitating me.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.363
It's not great.
Thank you in advance.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.781
Did you find anything out
since we talked?

11:38.864 --> 11:40.282
Well, as much
as I love telling you

11:40.366 --> 11:41.700
that you are a crazy person,

11:41.784 --> 11:44.578
a friend at the agency
gave me these.

11:44.662 --> 11:47.123
Security stills
from too many places.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.999
Oh, my God. That's her.
I've been telling you.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.335
Yeah, but it's nothing
without context.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.711
-You brought the View-Master?
-Oh, I couldn't get it.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.130
It's--Don't look at me
like that.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.340
It's a real thing, I promise,
and I'll work on it,

11:56.424 --> 11:57.925
but I do want
to show you something. Look.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.802
That's my psych evaluation.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.554
None of these answers--
I didn't say any of this stuff.

12:01.637 --> 12:04.140
Wow. Okay.
How do you even have this?

12:04.223 --> 12:06.517
I just--I saw it
on Benjamin's desk.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.105
-We slept together.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.440
I know.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.316
Well,
now the tears make sense.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.861
My instincts are to say,
"Hey friend, how you doing?

12:16.944 --> 12:18.946
You good?"
My brain is telling me

12:19.029 --> 12:20.948
that stealing CIA files
is a felony.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.450
They will take you away.
They will put you in cuffs.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.701
They will cut the bangs off.

12:23.784 --> 12:26.203
I didn't steal anything, okay?
I just documented

12:26.287 --> 12:27.746
a picture in an envelope
on a desk.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.415
That is not better.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.625
There are very few people
that have access to your file

12:31.709 --> 12:34.128
that could fabricate
a psych eval.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.463
Wait, if Benjamin...

12:35.546 --> 12:37.006
No, it's not Benjamin, okay?
Listen, he's my handler.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.257
He takes care of me.
It's not him.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.592
-It's someone else at the CIA.
-Da-da-da-da-

12:39.675 --> 12:42.011
Hi. Hi, Jada!
Hey. This just got fun.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.430
-Mm-hmm. How is Justin?
-No, no. I'm talking to Shane

12:44.513 --> 12:45.556
for five minutes.
Can you just please, like...

12:45.639 --> 12:47.099
Mm-hmm, mm-mm.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.893
Do you three feel comfortable
working together in a group?

12:48.976 --> 12:50.936
-Great.
-What...

12:51.020 --> 12:52.313
Is she leading this shit?

12:52.396 --> 12:54.356
-Like, what is happening?
-She is Imperial Atlantic.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.483
-Look up.
-I'm so confused.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.026
It's a bird. It's a plane.
It's Jada.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.944
Also, what is she talking
about, the three of us?

12:59.028 --> 13:01.197
-To whom is she referring?
-Okay, people,

13:01.280 --> 13:02.323
-Let's start.
-Fuck!

13:02.406 --> 13:04.366
Welcome to the mandatory

13:04.450 --> 13:05.868
-Imperial Atlantic continuing

13:05.951 --> 13:08.370
-qualification training-
-Brenda, hi. What's going on?

13:08.454 --> 13:09.622
-What's up?
-Cassie,

13:09.705 --> 13:12.583
I've been texting you
for hours.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.793
Call me means call me.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.170
Hildegard left.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.588
Who?

13:17.671 --> 13:19.590
Wait, my f...
Oh, my friend left?

13:19.673 --> 13:20.508
What do you mean?
Where'd she go?

13:20.591 --> 13:22.218
We had a chat.

13:22.301 --> 13:26.514
I was extra careful not to say
anything dark or tragic.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.474
Then I went to make her
some tea, but--

13:28.557 --> 13:30.309
Okay, listen, I'm sorry.
Brenda, I'm sorry.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.269
Thank you, Brenda.
I'll call you later.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.897
For fuck's sake, Megan,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

13:34.980 --> 13:36.273
Cassie.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.108
Hi! Would you like
to join the group

13:38.192 --> 13:40.402
for the group portion
of the group training today?

13:56.502 --> 13:58.170
Oh, my God. Megan!

13:58.254 --> 14:00.047
-Cherri!
-Where have you been?

14:00.130 --> 14:02.258
Oh, it's a long story,

14:02.341 --> 14:03.592
but I'm so glad
that you're still here.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.843
Oh, honey, I bought the joint.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.345
-You bought it?
-Yes.

14:06.428 --> 14:07.596
I've made more money stripping

14:07.680 --> 14:08.847
than I ever did
as a flight attendant.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.975
-You're, like, the boss.
-Yeah.

14:11.058 --> 14:14.436
Oh, my God.
That's... Listen, honey.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.604
I need my lockbox.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.314
-Oh, I don't have it anymore.
-What?

14:17.398 --> 14:19.775
I rented a room
to this bank teller, Wanda.

14:19.858 --> 14:21.610
She thought rent was optional.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.696
So when I kicked her out,
she took a ton of stuff,

14:23.779 --> 14:24.947
including your lockbox.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.324
Oh, no. Cherri, seriously?

14:27.408 --> 14:28.576
I tried calling.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.743
But your phone was,
like, disconnected.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.036
-Yeah.
-And why on earth

14:31.120 --> 14:32.955
would you leave something
that important with me?

14:33.038 --> 14:34.707
Because who would think
of looking for it here?

14:34.790 --> 14:36.333
No offense. I thought...

14:39.253 --> 14:42.381
It was a good idea at the time,
but honestly, Cherri,

14:42.464 --> 14:43.882
I'm just making this up
as I go along

14:43.966 --> 14:45.926
and I'm not doing
the best job of it.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.678
I can't say I fully get it

14:47.761 --> 14:49.263
and it feels like
for legal reasons,

14:49.346 --> 14:50.931
I don't want to
fully get it,

14:51.015 --> 14:52.558
but you're getting
your box back.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.936
I know where Wanda is now.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.231
She might shoot at us.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.192
Okay.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.402
Good to know, thank you.

15:09.742 --> 15:10.993
Thanks.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.828
Cass seemed okay
when she left, right?

15:12.911 --> 15:14.496
I mean, like, not great,
but, you know-

15:14.580 --> 15:15.664
She was falling apart.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.166
She blew up that thing
with Marco,

15:17.249 --> 15:18.417
who was like the coolest guy,

15:18.500 --> 15:19.835
and then she rushed out
of here for a work thing.

15:19.918 --> 15:21.378
So no, she didn't seem okay.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.963
Okay, look, we can't just
sit around here.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.840
I mean, Cass needs
that View-Master

15:24.923 --> 15:26.675
and her life is essentially
on the line.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.177
If we call the cops,
they can get it.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.678
If we call the cops,
they'll just put it in evidence

15:29.762 --> 15:31.055
and then we'll really be fucked.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.307
Okay, well, you got all
the answers then, don't you?

15:33.390 --> 15:35.017
Okay, okay.
Look, look, look, look.

15:37.478 --> 15:41.106
The Diazes knew, like, really
specific shit about us, okay?

15:41.190 --> 15:42.941
You know, like stuff
that we had talked about.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.526
They must have bugged
the apartment.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.029
Are you fucking kidding?
Max, are you--

15:47.112 --> 15:48.155
They bugged the apartment?

15:48.238 --> 15:49.448
-Yeah.
-My God.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.577
Okay, okay, okay.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.620
This sounds kind of bananas,

15:54.703 --> 15:56.413
but could you, like,

15:56.497 --> 15:59.375
could you, like, use the bugs
to find them?

15:59.458 --> 16:01.126
Potentially.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.046
But, "potentially," like--
like, yes?

16:04.129 --> 16:06.882
Then what?

16:06.965 --> 16:08.133
Confront them?

16:08.217 --> 16:09.635
You're acting like
Cassie did last year

16:09.718 --> 16:10.844
before I got hit by a car.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.221
I don't want to get hit
by a car again.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.347
It's not unreasonable.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.057
Can you just--I found them.

16:16.558 --> 16:17.685
Can they still--

16:17.768 --> 16:19.144
No, they're disabled.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.105
Oh, okay.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.564
-Okay.
-Fuck.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.108
Yeah.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.068
Like, we can reverse
traceroute the bugs,

16:26.151 --> 16:27.486
use them
to find the IP address,

16:27.569 --> 16:29.488
and then use that
to find the physical address.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.370
You have to do your Max thing.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.207
Okay.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.668
Okay.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.631
Um, so remember yesterday
when we were,

16:47.715 --> 16:51.552
you know, tied up
and, um, scared for our lives

16:51.635 --> 16:52.928
and I said a bunch of shit

16:53.011 --> 16:54.638
and I was coursing
with adrenaline--

16:54.722 --> 16:56.098
I'm in their laptop.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.434
Wait, already? Seriously?
That was so fast.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.102
Whoa, shit!

17:00.185 --> 17:01.353
What? What, what?
What is that face?

17:01.437 --> 17:03.105
When the Diazes
weren't punching me in the face,

17:03.188 --> 17:04.481
they were hacking
into my laptop.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.774
They got everything.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.860
My client info,
my full history...

17:07.943 --> 17:09.737
Oh, shit. Records of jobs
I did for you

17:09.820 --> 17:11.447
when you were
at Davis and Carlisle.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.033
Oh, my God. Okay.
Uh, can you delete that?

17:15.117 --> 17:16.452
No, it's in a crypto file.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.245
I can see everything, but
I can't do anything from here.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.580
Okay.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.666
What, okay?

17:22.750 --> 17:23.959
Okay, yeah, we're going to go

17:24.042 --> 17:26.545
and we're going to get
their laptop

17:26.628 --> 17:28.005
and we're going to get
the View-Master

17:28.088 --> 17:30.299
and we're just going to
bang it out in one trip.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.482
There you go. And we go down.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.275
Very good. And here we go.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.527
Thank you. Hey...
Oh, God.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.945
Cassie, you've got to be
careful!

17:52.029 --> 17:52.905
You could hurt someone.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.490
You were supposed
to grab my hand.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.450
Well, you could drown, my God.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.035
-Cassie!
-Yes.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.661
Your turn
for some pop-up questions.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.288
There's a potential
explosive device

18:01.371 --> 18:02.998
in one of the overhead
compartments.

18:03.081 --> 18:06.126
-Go.
-We're doing rafts right now.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.961
-Go.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.838
Okay.
I put all the passengers

18:09.922 --> 18:11.089
on the opposite side
of the plane.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.841
I cover the device
with cushions

18:12.925 --> 18:14.343
and luggage and wet blankets.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.095
-Okay?
-Wow.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.346
Due to severe turbulence,

18:17.429 --> 18:19.181
passengers are having
a panic attack. Go.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.724
I look the passenger
in the eye, take their hand,

18:20.808 --> 18:22.184
I apply pressure, and tell them
to take a deep breaths

18:22.267 --> 18:23.477
and I tell them
everything is going to be fine

18:23.560 --> 18:24.520
and they're perfectly safe.

18:28.106 --> 18:29.233
Shane, what am I going to do?

18:29.316 --> 18:30.359
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

18:30.442 --> 18:31.568
Okay, Cassie. Okay.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.780
I will look into it
for you, okay, Cassie?

18:34.863 --> 18:36.865
We need to save
this person's life.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.909
-Put that thing over her mouth.
-This person is fine.

18:38.992 --> 18:41.119
I am the one that is not fine.
I am not fine.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.120
My life is not fine.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.413
-Okay.
-Okay? I need your help.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.332
Okay, good.
I'm glad that you realize that.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.126
So while I look into it,
you leave it alone.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.504
Look at me.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.466
What?

18:54.550 --> 18:55.884
Are you?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.177
Am I what?

18:57.261 --> 18:58.345
Are you--

18:58.428 --> 18:59.888
-No!
-Okay. Okay.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.474
I told you, I'm a year
sober, Shane, for fuck's sake.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.976
You know what?

19:04.059 --> 19:05.352
Just text me the photos
from Berlin

19:05.435 --> 19:06.687
and from Echo Park Lake
and if the CIA

19:06.770 --> 19:07.896
is doing this to me,
I will figure it out.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.523
-Stop, Cassie.
-What?

19:09.606 --> 19:10.983
Stop wishing for this
to be true.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.193
The CIA can bend facts.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.737
They can make it so
that you never even existed.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.073
So if the shit is true,
then the shit is bad.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.825
Can we just finish
this station, please?

19:19.908 --> 19:20.909
Because if you're not
paying attention,

19:20.993 --> 19:22.578
you're putting people
at risk.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.871
You need to listen.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.914
Just fuck off, Carol.
Just fuck off, Carol.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.499
What the fuck do you want
from me, Carol?

19:31.962 --> 19:35.090
We have lives to save.
Let's calm down.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.676
Fuck this!

19:58.488 --> 20:00.365
Hey, come in here.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.996
Put this back
in Essential Files,

20:06.079 --> 20:07.539
and I'd like for there

20:07.623 --> 20:09.958
not to be a record
that I had it out.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.335
Done.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.050
Vicky, can you pull
the communications

20:18.133 --> 20:20.802
between Mr. Berry and an asset
named Cassandra Bowden?

20:20.886 --> 20:22.262
Mm-hmm.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.972
During any specific time period?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.349
All of them.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.880
You just--You can sit there
as long as you want.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.719
Hey, um, Cassie,
just to clarify,

21:02.803 --> 21:04.012
did you come here to talk

21:04.096 --> 21:06.014
or just, like,
sit very, very quietly

21:06.098 --> 21:07.349
'cause I can do either, but--

21:07.432 --> 21:09.518
My life is just, like,
a lot right now, you know?

21:09.601 --> 21:12.187
I--I don't know.
My time here in L.A.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.355
is completely up in the air

21:13.438 --> 21:15.107
and for reasons
I can't really get into,

21:15.190 --> 21:16.608
all my friends are
dealing with their own shit.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.860
I just fucked up
my relationship royally

21:18.944 --> 21:21.530
and, um, I cannot catch
a fucking break

21:21.613 --> 21:23.699
and I am trying
to hold on so tight

21:23.782 --> 21:27.828
and I'm literally losing my mind
and I--I--I feel so needy.

21:27.911 --> 21:28.829
I'm--I'm sorry.

21:31.289 --> 21:33.542
Wow. That--
That was a lot of words.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.502
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
be putting all this on you,

21:35.585 --> 21:37.462
but honestly,
I was kind of hoping

21:37.546 --> 21:39.172
you didn't know me
well enough to judge me,

21:39.256 --> 21:40.757
which I can't believe

21:40.841 --> 21:42.009
I just said it out loud.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.469
No, listen,
I'm totally the exact person

21:44.553 --> 21:46.596
that you should come to,
if the world is falling apart.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.473
That's like game time for me.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.100
This is when I do my best work.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.435
Really? Is that right?

21:51.518 --> 21:54.229
Yes, I have a sword mounted
on my wall.

21:54.312 --> 21:56.565
I'm ready for the end days,
okay?

21:56.648 --> 21:57.774
Okay, cool.

21:57.858 --> 21:58.900
Do you have anything for
when you're being framed

21:58.984 --> 22:00.444
for international espionage
or...

22:05.323 --> 22:07.534
So people usually say this
about me,

22:07.617 --> 22:09.202
but I can't tell
if you're joking right now.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.412
No, no, I'm joking.
Sorry, bad joke.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.205
Look,

22:12.289 --> 22:15.167
any time that you need
to hide from life,

22:15.250 --> 22:19.004
or if you just want to talk,
you're always welcome here.

22:19.087 --> 22:21.423
I like you.
I don't like a lot of people.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.592
Most people are sheep,
and assholes.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.552
-But I do need to--

22:25.635 --> 22:26.845
I need to go right now.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.347
You have to go, right.
Drug deal, again.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.682
See, that's funny.

22:30.766 --> 22:31.850
I'm going to finish this
before I leave.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.101
There's another one
in the shaker.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.270
Are you sure
you don't want one?

22:35.353 --> 22:37.147
Uh, no, no. I'm good.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.751
Wow, you're popular.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.294
Uh, No.

22:59.377 --> 23:02.172
I'm really not.
I used to be.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.299
I used to be really fun.

23:04.382 --> 23:05.467
I used to be a lot of things,

23:05.550 --> 23:07.803
but now I'm just, um...

23:13.767 --> 23:15.894
Okay, what the fuck is this?

23:15.977 --> 23:17.312
Dry mouth? Oh.

23:17.395 --> 23:18.605
It would taste so good.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.649
Sweating? Are you nervous?

23:20.732 --> 23:24.069
The cold glass would feel great
in your hands and on your lips.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.112
Broken heart?

23:25.195 --> 23:26.488
You wouldn't even think
about it.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.739
I mean, fuck, you wouldn't have
to think about anything.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.867
The anxiety, the fear.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.745
Fuck it all.
Just have one drink.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.330
Just have the drink.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.673
You know what?
I will have one.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.383
-If you have time.
-Yeah.

23:55.684 --> 23:56.810
Thanks.

24:23.753 --> 24:24.880
That's the bank teller?

24:24.963 --> 24:26.381
Do not get close to her.

24:26.464 --> 24:27.465
Like I said, she has a gun.

24:27.549 --> 24:28.758
Well, if it ain't the stripper

24:28.842 --> 24:31.970
who kicked me
out of her big fancy house.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.306
Wanda, we don't want
any trouble.

24:34.389 --> 24:37.267
Just give my friend Megan
her lockbox back.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.186
Make me, bitch.

24:39.269 --> 24:41.271
You think 'cause
you got a six-jet jacuzzi

24:41.354 --> 24:43.064
and travertine counters,
you're better than me?

24:43.148 --> 24:45.400
You take your clothes off
for money.

24:45.483 --> 24:47.944
Hey! Don't you speak
to her like that!

24:48.028 --> 24:50.697
You have no idea
how hard Cherri works.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.532
She is providing
a time-honored service

24:52.616 --> 24:54.326
that makes people feel good,

24:54.409 --> 24:56.786
and she risks her own health
and personal safety.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.581
And I'm going to skip the part
about the difficult

24:59.664 --> 25:03.585
social, economic, upward
mobility for adult entertainers

25:03.668 --> 25:05.170
and the stigma
that is attached to that

25:05.253 --> 25:07.756
and just call you a thief
and a freeloader.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.716
Now, give me
my goddamn lockbox back!

25:14.846 --> 25:16.097
Go fuck yourself.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.939
-Megan, what did you do?
-Calm down.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.649
Let's just wait 30 minutes.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.502
Jenny.
What are you doing here?

25:45.585 --> 25:46.878
Why are you here?
You know, I gotta tell you,

25:46.962 --> 25:47.796
it's starting to feel like
you're following me.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.005
It's a little fucking weird.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.216
I'm not going to do
your podcast, okay?

25:51.299 --> 25:53.593
So please stop showing up
at places where I am.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.345
Stop stalking me, okay?

25:55.428 --> 25:57.055
What are you doing?
Why do you have that?

25:57.138 --> 25:58.807
Why are you--Why are you--

25:58.890 --> 26:00.308
-Why are you holding that?
-It's my boyfriend.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.061
He's still totally hung up
on his ex, like, crazy hung up.

26:03.144 --> 26:04.229
I don't know
what he sees in her.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.064
She's a self-absorbed,
stupid loser.

26:06.147 --> 26:07.482
Like, how is that better
than me?

26:07.565 --> 26:08.858
-Like--
-Jenny, listen.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.319
Don't drink because of a man.
All right?

26:11.403 --> 26:13.446
And then when you find out
that man is horrible,

26:13.530 --> 26:14.990
don't drink then, either.
Okay?

26:15.073 --> 26:15.865
You got to get out of here.
You gotta go.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.325
But you're here.

26:17.409 --> 26:21.705
Yes, I am here because
I'm here for all this stuff, so.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.707
Oh, you're throwing a party?

26:23.790 --> 26:25.750
Yeah, yep.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.544
Throwing a big old party. Yep.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.004
-Do you need help?
-Nope, don't need help.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.213
Do you want to come back
to my place

26:30.297 --> 26:31.798
and we could not drink together?

26:31.881 --> 26:33.008
Party's tonight, actually,

26:33.091 --> 26:35.468
so, yeah, I'm really busy
doing this.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.678
Let me tell you something.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.680
I want you--
I want you to listen to me.

26:38.763 --> 26:42.976
Sobriety is about the journey,
not the destination.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.020
-Okay.
-All right? Now, put that away.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.563
Let's go. Put that down.
Get out of here.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.232
This is a bad place for you.
Not good.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.114
You are a such
a piece of shit.

29:01.197 --> 29:02.198
You're a fucking loser.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.992
You're the worst
fucking person ever.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.577
You're okay. It's okay.

29:07.954 --> 29:09.873
You're a fucking asshole.
He's not an asshole.

29:09.956 --> 29:12.959
You're an asshole. You're
the fucking asshole, actually.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.169
You're so stupid.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.547
Want to pack
your shit up, Marco?

29:17.630 --> 29:19.424
Okay. Let's pack your shit.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.653
I'm gonna fix this...

29:40.737 --> 29:42.489
I'm gonna fix this
right now.

29:42.572 --> 29:47.744
I'm going to call a friend
who's going to help me.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.373
Hi, Dot. It's Cassie.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.542
I just wanted to say thank you

29:54.626 --> 29:57.086
for allowing me the freedom

29:57.170 --> 29:58.421
to call you when I needed you.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.716
Hi, um, it's me again.

30:01.799 --> 30:03.051
-Why aren't you answering

30:03.134 --> 30:04.552
your fucking phone, girl?

30:04.636 --> 30:05.887
-Motherfucker!
-To send your message...

30:05.970 --> 30:06.888
I'm sorry,
I did not mean that.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.056
I did not mean that.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.683
Here I am, any time,
reaching out to you.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.895
Hey, Dot.
Um, pick up your fucking phone!

30:13.978 --> 30:15.396
Could you just,
like, call me back

30:15.480 --> 30:17.690
'cause I really need
to talk to you?

30:17.774 --> 30:19.359
Thank you so, so much.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.653
I really--Oh, fuck.

30:21.736 --> 30:22.612
Oh, God.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.286
Hey, Cassie. It's Justin.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.080
Um, Shane's just in the kitchen

30:32.163 --> 30:33.498
being too detailed
with the meat.

30:33.581 --> 30:36.876
-I've heard so much about you.
-Hi. Hey.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.920
Sorry, I just have to talk
to Shane

30:39.003 --> 30:41.673
because he's the only other
person at the CIA I know

30:41.756 --> 30:43.591
aside from stupid Dot.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.134
Um, oh, sorry, but... Shh.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.222
I have to talk about
the secret CIA stuff with Shane,

30:49.305 --> 30:52.600
so could you just, could you
grab him for me, please?

30:52.684 --> 30:53.935
Um, what?

30:54.018 --> 30:56.896
Central Intelligence Agency.
Why don't you know that?

30:56.980 --> 30:58.273
Everybody knows that.

30:58.356 --> 31:00.400
Babe,
uh, Cassie's on the phone?

31:00.483 --> 31:02.151
Are you doing
something with the CIA?

31:03.278 --> 31:05.446
What? She--she said that?

31:05.530 --> 31:07.323
She's a--she's a jokester.
She's a riot.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.324
Give me that fucking phone.

31:08.408 --> 31:09.951
Thanks. One second, bye.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.331
Do you want me to be happy?

31:15.415 --> 31:17.333
I maybe had a future
with Justin,

31:17.417 --> 31:18.960
and you maybe
just fucked that up.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.129
Do you have any idea
how hard I have worked

31:21.212 --> 31:22.880
to keep the people that I love

31:22.964 --> 31:24.799
from knowing exactly
what I do to protect them?

31:24.882 --> 31:26.384
I'm the one
that needs protecting here.

31:26.467 --> 31:27.885
And also, I'm so sorry!

31:27.969 --> 31:30.930
I didn't mean to tell Justin
about our secret CIA stuff.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.307
I'm really, really sorry.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.809
But the thing is my life
is in actual danger right now,

31:34.892 --> 31:35.935
so I need you to listen to me.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.979
Oh, like the actual danger
in the bar

31:38.062 --> 31:39.856
in Reykjavik
when the North Korean agent

31:39.939 --> 31:42.692
got knifed in the back and bled
out all over the concrete floor?

31:42.775 --> 31:43.776
That danger?

31:46.446 --> 31:47.697
I don't... I don't...

31:47.780 --> 31:49.324
I don't know. I...

31:49.407 --> 31:50.658
You're my friend.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.660
I just--
What happened to my friend?

31:52.744 --> 31:54.704
Shane, you know,
that used to, like...

31:55.747 --> 31:57.999
take me out for oyster night
and laugh all night long?

31:58.082 --> 31:59.584
Like, where did...
where--where is--

31:59.667 --> 32:02.170
He is working...

32:02.253 --> 32:04.589
and you are drunk.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.342
And that's so fucking sad.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.969
Whoa. Just, like...

32:10.053 --> 32:12.430
that--I am not drunk.

32:12.513 --> 32:14.599
No, no, no, no, no, no.

32:16.684 --> 32:18.686
You need to sober up

32:18.770 --> 32:20.063
and when I am done trying
to salvage

32:20.146 --> 32:21.856
whatever relationship
that I have left with Justin,

32:21.939 --> 32:23.107
I will keep digging,

32:23.191 --> 32:26.235
but that has got to be
good enough for now.

32:28.196 --> 32:30.114
-Cassie...
-But, but, but--Hold on.

32:36.704 --> 32:39.832
I don't know what to...
Help me.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.752
I try so hard to be good
and I'm only window dressing.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.462
I am here to make you feel bad

32:44.545 --> 32:46.297
about the woman
you're never going to be!

32:46.381 --> 32:48.383
Never!
How fucking depressing is that?

32:48.466 --> 32:49.676
I mean, what's the point
of it all?

32:49.759 --> 32:51.761
In fact,
I shouldn't even exist.

32:51.844 --> 32:54.055
No, no, wait.
You shouldn't fucking exist!

32:54.138 --> 32:57.058
I shouldn't exist?
Well, I fucking exist!

32:57.141 --> 32:59.060
Fuck your help.
I'm in control!

32:59.143 --> 33:00.395
You're the fuck up, not me!

33:03.481 --> 33:04.607
You think
you can break things?

33:04.691 --> 33:05.983
Well, I can fucking
break things too.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.409
Easy does it!

33:14.492 --> 33:15.576
Easy does it!

33:15.660 --> 33:18.079
-Easy does it!

33:22.041 --> 33:23.710
Easy does it!

33:23.793 --> 33:26.713
Easy does it!

33:28.506 --> 33:30.633
You think
you're so fucking smart?

33:30.717 --> 33:34.262
I will go where I can't hear
anything.

33:42.061 --> 33:43.896
-- So it's been an hour.
-- I know.

33:45.314 --> 33:46.774
Okay, I have to say it,
I really hope

33:46.858 --> 33:48.943
I didn't use
too much mushroom powder.

33:49.026 --> 33:50.570
What happens
if you use too much?

33:51.821 --> 33:53.364
You kind of die?

33:53.448 --> 33:54.574
Oh, my God.

33:57.952 --> 34:00.621
No, no...

34:09.464 --> 34:11.466
Dear lord, she's a hoarder!

34:13.801 --> 34:15.178
Oh.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.576
What happened?

34:38.659 --> 34:41.662
Fucking A, I knew
that scam artist took my shit.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.247
This is, like,
my most prized possession.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.208
-Is that your thing?
-Yes.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.418
-Let's go.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.381
Maybe I did
use too much powder.

34:53.591 --> 34:56.302
-Do you care?
-Cherri!

34:56.385 --> 34:58.846
I'll just call 911 once
we hit the interstate.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.181
-Just to be safe, right?
-Yeah.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.141
-Okay. Come on.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.815
Whoa.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.817
Okay, the Diazes are like
serious bounty hunters.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.527
Fugitive recovery,
intimidation, kidnapping...

35:12.610 --> 35:14.362
Okay, yeah, but this isn't
surprising, though.

35:14.445 --> 35:15.905
Like, remember
when they drugged us

35:15.988 --> 35:17.782
and tied us up and shoved
a taser in your mouth?

35:19.116 --> 35:20.743
Yes, Annie.
My face remembers that incident.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.746
Okay. Um...

35:25.414 --> 35:26.958
Okay, look, Max,
this is insane.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.543
Like, what do we do here?

35:28.626 --> 35:30.378
Ping sweep to determine
if the host is alive or dead

35:30.461 --> 35:33.172
then see if they're inside
and online.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.174
Okay, yeah, no. Sure.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.634
That, um... Jesus, who knew

35:36.717 --> 35:39.387
Sid and Nancy had such
good taste in architecture?

35:39.470 --> 35:42.056
They're home. Let's do it.

35:42.139 --> 35:44.308
Let's do what?

35:44.392 --> 35:45.434
Max?

35:46.477 --> 35:47.395
Max.

36:03.244 --> 36:06.539
Easy does it! Easy does it!

36:06.622 --> 36:07.540
Easy does it!

36:07.623 --> 36:08.833
Fuck you, sand!

36:12.170 --> 36:14.005
Easy does it!

36:14.088 --> 36:16.841
Easy does it! Easy does it!

36:20.887 --> 36:25.057
Easy does it! Easy does it!

36:25.141 --> 36:31.355
Easy does it!
Easy does it!

36:39.864 --> 36:40.907
Easy does it!

36:40.990 --> 36:45.036
Easy does it!
Easy does it!

36:45.119 --> 36:49.040
Easy does it!
Easy does it!

36:49.123 --> 36:50.416
Shut up.

36:51.709 --> 36:55.046
Shut up! Shut up!
-Easy does it!

36:55.129 --> 36:57.256
Easy does it! Easy--

37:02.845 --> 37:04.597
Okay, this is fucking tragic.
What is this?

37:04.680 --> 37:06.474
You wanted me to drink
and now I'm fucking drunk.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.768
-Isn't that great?
-No, I said sparkly and fun.

37:08.851 --> 37:10.436
I was very clear
about sparkly and fun.

37:10.519 --> 37:13.064
You made me throw away
a year of sobriety.

37:13.147 --> 37:14.982
Oh, my God, I can't.
I honestly can't with you.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.317
You can't what? You did this.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.778
No, I didn't.
And you lost a year of sobriety?

37:18.861 --> 37:20.905
How about, no, you didn't?

37:20.988 --> 37:22.239
You don't even--

37:22.323 --> 37:23.115
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.325
So you know what? Fuck you!

37:24.408 --> 37:25.534
Okay, I am so sick of

37:25.618 --> 37:26.827
your holier than thou attitude,
all right?

37:26.911 --> 37:30.248
We both know about
March 21st and March 23rd.

37:30.331 --> 37:31.749
-So how about fuck you?
-What, you're just gonna,

37:31.832 --> 37:33.125
like,
throw random dates at me?

37:33.209 --> 37:34.085
What is that, like,
some sort of threat?

37:34.168 --> 37:36.253
A threat? Okay, fine.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.005
Let's do this.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.848
I don't want it.
You. I don't want it.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.686
March 21st.

37:51.769 --> 37:54.397
Six months into your year
of sobriety.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.982
Oh, that--that's you.

38:22.174 --> 38:24.343
March 23rd, two days later.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.679
See, every time you tell
someone you're a year sober,

38:26.762 --> 38:28.639
it's a goddamn lie.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.641
No one knows, but you know.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.393
You're not better than me.
Got it?

38:33.269 --> 38:34.353
Hey!

38:34.437 --> 38:36.313
You're flooding
our place downstairs!

38:37.690 --> 38:39.400
Hey!
Are you in there?

38:40.943 --> 38:43.612
Hey, want to know my issue
with this whole double thing?

38:43.696 --> 38:45.364
Who the fuck
would want to be you?

39:27.698 --> 39:30.618
What
in the ever-loving fuck?

39:30.701 --> 39:33.287
How many people do you
have to hunt and torture

39:33.370 --> 39:35.039
to afford a house like this?

39:35.122 --> 39:37.333
-Right there, in the corner.

39:37.416 --> 39:38.793
Oh, my God.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.711
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, fuck.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.343
-Do you think they saw us?
-I don't think so.

39:48.385 --> 39:51.180
-Oh, I don't...Oh. Okay.
-My God.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.141
I don't understand
the attraction. Do you get it?

39:54.225 --> 39:55.476
-- No.
-- Okay.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.152
Max.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.367
What is he doing, what--

40:14.328 --> 40:15.454
What is he doing,
what--

40:20.084 --> 40:22.086
Yeah, okay.
Get the computer.

40:25.631 --> 40:26.841
One... What?

40:26.924 --> 40:28.592
Uh... One second, what?

40:30.052 --> 40:31.720
What the fuck is he doing?

40:33.514 --> 40:35.224
What the fuck!

40:53.951 --> 40:55.202
Join me in the shower.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.330
Ah! Fuck.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.300
Baby, come on, hurry up.

41:09.383 --> 41:10.801
Ay voy, mami.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.094
Here I come!

41:43.334 --> 41:45.586
Maxwell Montgomery Park,
are you fucking insane?

41:45.669 --> 41:47.379
You could have gotten
yourself killed.

41:47.463 --> 41:48.464
It's just a fucking ring!

41:48.547 --> 41:49.924
Yeah, you're right.
It's just a ring.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.301
It's a shiny rock overvalued
by capitalism.

41:52.384 --> 41:54.386
But I picked it out
after looking for months,

41:54.470 --> 41:56.388
and when you opened the box,
and I saw your face.

41:56.472 --> 42:00.100
I knew, I just knew
I got it right.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.186
I got it fucking right.

42:03.062 --> 42:05.022
You made it super clear
you don't care about the ring,

42:05.105 --> 42:06.106
but I do.

42:10.527 --> 42:11.654
Annie.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.497
Um...

42:21.580 --> 42:25.459
I called in a domestic
disturbance complaint.

42:25.542 --> 42:27.753
That should keep them busy
for a while.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.053
You've already done
so much for me, Cherri.

42:36.136 --> 42:39.098
But what I really need
is your car.

42:39.181 --> 42:41.308
Oh, um...

42:41.392 --> 42:42.768
I'll think about it.
I'll...

42:45.271 --> 42:47.648
Oh, um...

42:47.731 --> 42:50.234
Yeah, I'll--I'll take it
and I'll buy a better one.

42:50.317 --> 42:52.653
You are full of surprises.

42:53.988 --> 42:56.198
Maybe so, I don't know.

42:56.282 --> 42:57.574
But if I can get through this,

42:57.658 --> 42:59.868
I just want to get my life
together the way you did.

42:59.952 --> 43:01.328
Not for nothing,

43:01.412 --> 43:04.373
but you just drugged somebody,
stole your shit back,

43:04.456 --> 43:07.293
and bought a car
with a brick of cash.

43:07.376 --> 43:08.502
Stay this Megan.

43:08.585 --> 43:10.004
It'll get you far.

43:14.550 --> 43:15.718
Okay.

43:17.386 --> 43:19.138
Drive safely.

43:19.221 --> 43:20.889
All right.

43:20.973 --> 43:23.475
-Bye!
-Bye.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.293
Lived my whole life here,

43:49.376 --> 43:50.836
I can count on one hand

43:50.919 --> 43:52.671
the times I've gone
to the beach,

43:52.755 --> 43:55.174
so thanks
for the text message.

43:59.803 --> 44:01.972
So, you slipped and fell.

44:03.223 --> 44:04.975
Now down here in the sand,

44:05.059 --> 44:07.936
I guess you get to choose
how far you want to fall.

44:08.020 --> 44:10.522
I didn't choose to be here.

44:10.606 --> 44:12.399
I just...

44:12.483 --> 44:16.070
I think I just wanted
to feel the way I used to feel,

44:16.153 --> 44:21.492
you know, like amazing
and shiny and invincible...

44:22.618 --> 44:24.244
This time
just felt different.

44:24.328 --> 44:26.455
Even when you have a year,

44:26.538 --> 44:28.123
the disease waits for you

44:28.207 --> 44:30.751
and picks up
right where you left off.

44:33.087 --> 44:34.546
I don't have a year.

44:36.006 --> 44:37.174
I'm a fucking liar.

44:38.759 --> 44:40.052
I don't have a year.

44:41.970 --> 44:43.722
I slipped twice in New York.

44:43.806 --> 44:45.724
That's why I left.
That's why I came here.

44:45.808 --> 44:47.601
I just wanted to start over
and have, like, a clean slate

44:47.684 --> 44:49.895
where no one really knew me
and I...

44:51.313 --> 44:52.731
When I walked into
that first meeting here,

44:52.815 --> 44:56.068
I just--I didn't want
to be the new me again.

44:56.151 --> 44:57.694
I didn't want
to be a fucking Jenny.

44:57.778 --> 45:00.781
I wanted... I wanted my time
in New York to count.

45:00.864 --> 45:02.366
I had six months.

45:03.659 --> 45:06.495
You know? And that was--
that wasn't nothing.

45:06.578 --> 45:08.122
Now I just threw it all away,

45:08.205 --> 45:10.457
and it felt like shit
while it was happening

45:10.541 --> 45:12.626
and I wasn't myself,
I was a whole different person.

45:12.709 --> 45:13.877
Like, what the hell is that?

45:16.004 --> 45:19.216
That next drink is like
having sex with a gorilla.

45:20.426 --> 45:22.719
You're not done
until your gorilla is.

45:22.803 --> 45:25.305
But the anger, the violence...

45:26.181 --> 45:29.810
driving drunk to the beach,
for God's sakes?

45:29.893 --> 45:32.604
After everything you told me
you went through with your dad?

45:33.647 --> 45:35.190
I know, I know, I know.

45:35.274 --> 45:39.570
I don't know why I did that--
And I was doing so well.

45:39.653 --> 45:41.613
Oh, my God.

45:41.697 --> 45:44.158
No, you weren't!

45:44.241 --> 45:45.659
Look where we are.

45:45.742 --> 45:48.996
None of this works
without rigorous honesty,

45:49.079 --> 45:53.292
which means you tell the truth
even when it's easier to lie.

45:55.252 --> 45:56.879
So, now I'm just back
at square one?

45:58.922 --> 46:00.924
Cassie,

46:01.008 --> 46:04.344
the point is
you never left square one.

46:05.220 --> 46:08.307
You built your recovery
on a house of cards.

46:09.766 --> 46:10.809
And it fell over.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.020
That's what
a house of cards does.

46:13.103 --> 46:16.523
And until you take
that first step

46:16.607 --> 46:21.570
and admit that you're powerless
over the dark parts of yourself,

46:21.653 --> 46:24.072
you just keep
knocking down cards.

46:25.032 --> 46:27.701
My God, starting over
makes me want to just walk

46:27.784 --> 46:30.788
right into that ocean
and never come out.

46:30.871 --> 46:32.748
I've tried that once.

46:32.831 --> 46:35.375
Really. Yes.

46:35.459 --> 46:38.045
After my second marriage ended,

46:38.128 --> 46:41.423
I got caught up in the drama
and forgot about the physics.

46:41.507 --> 46:42.841
Didn't use enough weight,

46:44.635 --> 46:48.805
so the waves just washed me
back up to the shore.

46:48.889 --> 46:49.806
Shoop.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.644
Like nothing at all.

46:56.688 --> 47:01.568
I was feeling nothing,
like I was nothing.

47:04.655 --> 47:07.783
Take it from the lady
who tried drowning herself.

47:09.201 --> 47:13.372
It's a hell of a lot easier
to just quit drinking.

47:36.270 --> 47:37.855
Uh-uh-uh-easy does it!

47:37.938 --> 47:40.524
Uh-uh-uh-easy does it!

47:40.607 --> 47:42.943
Uh-uh-uh-easy does it!

47:43.026 --> 47:47.614
Uh-uh-uh-easy does it!
Uh-uh-uh-easy does it!

47:47.698 --> 47:50.117
Uh-uh-uh-easy does it!

47:50.200 --> 47:52.494
Uh-uh-uh-easy does it!

47:55.622 --> 47:58.292
Uh-uh-uh-easy does it!

48:49.676 --> 48:51.678
Ray, move your head.

48:53.680 --> 48:55.182
Ooh, good boy, Norman!
