<i>My father said the Army</i>
<i>makes all men one.</i>

00:53.975 --> 00:56.045
<i>But you never know which one.</i>

00:56.775 --> 00:58.845
<i>He didn't know Roland Bozz.</i>

01:02.695 --> 01:03.844
Get up!

01:04.334 --> 01:06.530
Get the fuck up!
Come on.

01:06.775 --> 01:10.450
Get your fucking low-life asses
out of bed!

01:13.855 --> 01:17.643
You got 15 minutes or you're
gonna do pushups until I pass out.

01:17.855 --> 01:20.892
Let's go. Let's go.
Get up! Let's go!

01:21.135 --> 01:23.968
Get your socks on and get outside,
you fucking pussies!

01:26.335 --> 01:27.973
- Hurry up!
- Move!

01:28.175 --> 01:30.484
- Ain't got all day.
- Move your ass, soldier.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.888
Next time won't be
no weekend in the stockade.

01:57.135 --> 01:59.968
It'll be a full-scale
motherfucking court-martial.

02:00.215 --> 02:04.254
Maybe a few years hard time in
Leavenworth. How's that fly, dipshit?

02:05.055 --> 02:08.445
Discounting reception, basic training
corrective custody...

02:08.655 --> 02:13.046
...been in the Army more than three
months. Most of it in the stockade.

02:20.935 --> 02:25.053
Get on that fucking deuce!
Get up on that deuce, boy!

02:26.895 --> 02:29.363
You don't need no special
invitation, son!

02:29.575 --> 02:32.248
Do as I ask! Hoist that
GI ass on that deuce!

02:32.495 --> 02:35.453
Let's go. Get it done!
Get it done!

02:43.495 --> 02:46.328
Private Bozz, Roland.
No middle initial.

02:46.575 --> 02:48.133
You're going to infantry.

02:48.375 --> 02:51.048
I bet my left nut
they bag and tag you in a week.

02:51.255 --> 02:54.565
Any man tries that hard to get out
will never see home again.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.448
I don't like the rehearsal,
so I'll skip the show.

02:57.695 --> 03:00.050
Fuck you. Get on that deuce.
Let's go!

03:15.655 --> 03:16.974
Bozz.

03:17.935 --> 03:22.247
I got a buddy in Charlie Company
says he knows a fellow by that name.

03:22.775 --> 03:25.005
Says he's the biggest fuck-up
in the Army.

03:25.575 --> 03:29.454
Clowning around and always acting
like fucking bozo.

03:30.015 --> 03:34.167
Article 15, recycled through basic,
all kinds of goldbrick shit.

03:35.975 --> 03:39.445
Sounds to me like that fellow's
no more than a goddamn coward.

03:40.575 --> 03:42.088
Afraid of Tigerland, huh?

03:42.455 --> 03:43.444
Should be scared.

03:43.695 --> 03:45.970
They hump your ass until it falls off.

03:46.855 --> 03:50.689
- I heard a guy from Bravo died there.
- No, man, that's a rumor.

03:51.255 --> 03:54.645
You afraid of big old Tigerland,
Private Fuck-up?

03:54.895 --> 03:58.888
Read this and tell me what happens.
I gotta get away from this guy.

04:02.535 --> 04:03.888
Go for it, Bozz!

04:06.495 --> 04:07.484
Private Bozz!

04:11.615 --> 04:14.448
What the fuck?
Stop the goddamn truck!

04:17.935 --> 04:20.449
Goddamn it!
What the fuck is your problem?

04:20.654 --> 04:23.328
You stupid motherfucker!
You're nothing but a...

04:23.575 --> 04:25.850
Get back in that truck,
you little fuck!

04:26.055 --> 04:28.888
The rest of you motherfuckers,
sit your asses down!

04:31.215 --> 04:32.773
<i>Good morning, gentlemen.</i>

04:33.015 --> 04:34.926
<i>My name is Captain Saunders.</i>

04:35.135 --> 04:37.046
Commanding officer, Alpha Company.

04:37.255 --> 04:39.246
Third advance infantry
training brigade.

04:39.495 --> 04:41.486
Welcome to the infantry, gentlemen.

04:41.695 --> 04:45.654
No matter where you did your basic,
either Fort Polk or elsewhere...

04:45.895 --> 04:49.126
...rest assured that we train the
proudest, the toughest...

04:49.335 --> 04:50.893
...the best-equipped soldiers.

04:51.095 --> 04:55.088
This base is the largest supplier
of combat troops overseas.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.968
So don't let any man here
start having any little...

04:58.175 --> 05:01.167
...pasty fucking daydreams
about being anyplace else.

05:01.415 --> 05:02.894
I shit you not, gentlemen.

05:03.455 --> 05:05.969
You are headed for
a two-way firing range.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.245
You will be sent to the war.

05:08.455 --> 05:11.174
You will be here for an
eight-week training cycle.

05:11.415 --> 05:14.054
After that, you will remain here
for a week more.

05:14.295 --> 05:17.253
We will ship you to an outpost
10 miles from here...

05:17.495 --> 05:21.693
...that is known throughout the Army
as the second worst place on earth.

05:21.935 --> 05:23.254
Tigerland.

05:23.495 --> 05:25.963
It is the stateside province
of Vietnam...

05:26.215 --> 05:29.173
...and it is as close to the war
as we can make it.

05:29.375 --> 05:32.173
Now, gentlemen,
it behooves you to learn...

05:32.375 --> 05:34.650
...what little we can teach you here.

05:34.855 --> 05:36.971
For if you do, then maybe...

05:37.215 --> 05:38.364
...just maybe...

05:38.575 --> 05:42.648
...you will return one day to play
stink-finger with Sally back home.

05:42.855 --> 05:43.844
Let's get squared away.

05:44.055 --> 05:47.365
Those of you not on detail
will have a pass for the weekend.

05:47.575 --> 05:49.850
Training begins Monday at 0430.

05:50.055 --> 05:53.889
From that time on, every
son of a bitch humps his own load.

06:06.295 --> 06:09.207
- Sucky-sucky, baby?
- Oh, no, thank you.

06:26.615 --> 06:27.843
There you go.

06:32.735 --> 06:35.295
- You got a high sex drive.
- You're right.

06:35.495 --> 06:36.644
Which line says that?

06:36.855 --> 06:40.052
I'm no expert but it says
you're gonna have sex real soon.

06:40.695 --> 06:43.653
- What about me?
- Sex for Sheri as well.

06:46.815 --> 06:48.043
There you go.

06:48.935 --> 06:50.573
- Did you read it?
- No, I didn't.

06:50.775 --> 06:53.687
Me, neither. I keep it around
to piss everybody off.

06:53.895 --> 06:54.884
Jim Paxton.

06:56.135 --> 07:00.048
Let's not become friends. You could
die and I'd miss you too much.

07:00.255 --> 07:01.483
Excuse me?

07:03.055 --> 07:05.774
It's a joke. Forget it.
Roland Bozz.

07:05.975 --> 07:08.808
This here is Sheri and Claudia
or Claudia and Sheri.

07:09.015 --> 07:10.414
Ladies, Jim Paxton.

07:10.615 --> 07:13.334
- Good to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

07:13.535 --> 07:15.127
Charmed, I'm sure.

07:15.495 --> 07:17.645
- Let me buy you ladies a drink.
- Right on.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.248
Four, please.

07:19.455 --> 07:21.764
- You girls from here?
- Born and bred. You?

07:21.975 --> 07:24.443
- Upstate New York.
- New York.

07:25.055 --> 07:27.285
How about you, Bozz?
Where are you from?

07:27.495 --> 07:30.532
Texas, Jim. It's in the
Southwestern part of the U.S.

07:30.735 --> 07:34.569
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll double-check
that on the map. Thanks.

07:34.775 --> 07:36.970
They came down hard on you in company.

07:37.215 --> 07:39.854
- I'm surprised they let you off base.
- They didn't.

07:40.095 --> 07:43.007
- I'm confined to company air.
- Oh, you're AWOL?

07:43.215 --> 07:44.568
Man, the children.

07:44.775 --> 07:47.050
To peace on earth
and a cure for cancer.

07:47.295 --> 07:49.251
- Cheers.
- Amen.

07:49.495 --> 07:52.248
Don't take it all so seriously, Jim.
Lighten up.

07:52.895 --> 07:56.251
Man, all I said was, "To peace on
earth and a cure for cancer."

07:56.455 --> 07:59.049
- Who said it's a joke?
- You're doing a routine.

07:59.295 --> 08:01.490
A funny soldier with
two girls in a bar...

08:01.735 --> 08:03.373
Man, I'm not doing any routine.

08:03.615 --> 08:06.288
If you're gonna be an asshole
about it, fuck you.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.845
Now, Jim, that's not the answer.

08:10.335 --> 08:12.849
Oh, really, smart-ass?
Then what is?

08:13.375 --> 08:15.525
The answer is, I got a hotel room.

08:15.735 --> 08:19.045
We're gonna take these ladies
and fuck till the war is over.

08:19.975 --> 08:20.964
Okay.

08:47.295 --> 08:49.411
Hello. This is fun.

08:49.615 --> 08:52.083
Oh, really, really fun.

08:52.295 --> 08:55.685
- It's not bad for a couple grunts.
- Not bad for a couple grunts?

08:55.895 --> 08:58.170
Who are you?
Sergeant Rock, Easy Company?

08:58.375 --> 09:01.924
Who are you playing?
Absurd man in an absurd world?

09:02.135 --> 09:04.569
You're playing a fool
fighting the system.

09:04.775 --> 09:07.164
- There's a difference, Paxton.
- Really, what?

09:07.775 --> 09:09.254
I'm a failed fool.

09:09.735 --> 09:14.126
Yeah, you've got a rep. I heard
you're the biggest fool around.

09:14.335 --> 09:15.529
Oh, well, thank you.

09:15.735 --> 09:18.488
But that's it.
I'm still here when I should be out.

09:18.695 --> 09:20.845
- And I'm gonna get out.
- Not me.

09:21.055 --> 09:22.408
I enlisted.

09:22.615 --> 09:24.492
- Is this some war shit again?
- Yes.

09:24.735 --> 09:26.327
- I got the munchies.
- Me too.

09:26.575 --> 09:30.011
I wish I hadn't heard you say that.
I was starting to like you.

09:30.455 --> 09:33.253
You know, I thought a lot
about it, Bozz.

09:33.455 --> 09:34.854
I don't like the war.

09:35.095 --> 09:38.405
Maybe I'm even against it.
But I'm not against my country.

09:38.615 --> 09:41.175
Is there room service here?
Where's the phone?

09:41.375 --> 09:44.253
That's some fancy
political thinking, professor.

09:44.495 --> 09:47.453
Let me give you some advice.
Figure out a way to go.

09:47.695 --> 09:50.163
- Get out, singing while you go.
- Guys, help us.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.888
- We're hungry, you know?
- Me too, man.

09:54.175 --> 09:57.645
You know, that's not all, man.
It's not just political.

09:57.895 --> 10:00.853
I want to go.
I want to see what it's like.

10:01.055 --> 10:04.172
I want the experience.
I'm taking notes on everything.

10:04.415 --> 10:07.373
Shut up. I'm taking notes
on everything. One day...

10:07.615 --> 10:11.403
One day I'll write something
like James Jones or Hemingway.

10:11.615 --> 10:12.889
What will you write?

10:13.135 --> 10:16.127
That war is hell, men are brave,
that kind of old crap?

10:16.375 --> 10:19.731
So you've popped my fucking balloon.
Jesus Christ, Bozz.

10:19.975 --> 10:22.250
- 24-hour place on Bourbon Street.

10:32.815 --> 10:34.453
The girls are gone.

10:36.455 --> 10:37.854
Yes, they are.

10:39.815 --> 10:40.850
Okay.

10:51.895 --> 10:53.248
Hey, how you doing?

10:55.215 --> 10:56.443
Keep your head down.

10:56.655 --> 10:59.488
Fucking AWOL, piece of shit
son of a bitch.

10:59.735 --> 11:01.851
That bag of shit of yours in the dirt.

11:02.055 --> 11:05.525
Private Bozz is showing the
proper way to dig a hole under fire.

11:05.775 --> 11:08.687
Under fire, you will fall
to the earth and lie flat.

11:09.535 --> 11:12.368
Under fire, you will ask God
to remove your button...

11:12.575 --> 11:14.327
...to get closer to the ground.

11:14.575 --> 11:17.931
Under fire you will dig a hole
with your teeth if you have to.

11:18.175 --> 11:19.449
Open your mouth.

11:20.535 --> 11:21.854
Now, shitbird.

11:22.055 --> 11:23.204
Do it! Eat dirt!

11:24.575 --> 11:27.248
I don't hear you. "Yes, sergeant."

11:27.815 --> 11:30.727
- I'm still not hearing you.
- You wear a dress, sergeant?

11:34.015 --> 11:38.054
- What did you say, you piece of crap?
- Go kiss my ass, sergeant!

11:39.495 --> 11:41.690
You little finger-fucking cocksucker.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.654
I will make you push Fort Polk
into the sea!

11:44.895 --> 11:47.045
Sir, I already have a man in mind.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.364
Thank you.

11:49.095 --> 11:50.244
Eat dirt. Do it!

11:50.575 --> 11:51.803
Do it! Eat dirt!

11:53.255 --> 11:55.644
- Eat it!
- All right, sergeant, that's enough.

11:55.855 --> 11:57.447
Get these men moving.

11:58.335 --> 12:00.690
Move it! You heard the man.

12:01.415 --> 12:02.894
Let's move it! Get going!

12:04.615 --> 12:07.527
Miter, you're the new platoon guide,
the 2nd Platoon.

12:07.855 --> 12:10.050
Get Bozz in line.
If it don't happen...

12:10.295 --> 12:13.048
...even Jesus won't be able
to save you, understand?

12:13.295 --> 12:16.173
- Yes, sergeant.
- Have these men fall in and fall out.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.252
Platoon, fall in.

12:19.495 --> 12:21.645
Fall out to your weapons.

12:27.655 --> 12:31.887
Bozz, Bozz, Bozz, Bozz!

12:32.375 --> 12:35.447
What is wrong with you, private?
Move your ass, son.

12:35.655 --> 12:36.644
Let's go.

12:36.895 --> 12:37.884
Move it!

12:38.335 --> 12:39.654
- Bozz.
- Let's go!

12:42.015 --> 12:43.971
Get that bag of shit in the dirt.

12:49.735 --> 12:51.054
That's mine.

13:09.895 --> 13:11.647
Platoon, listen up.

13:11.855 --> 13:14.494
Platoon, we got a heavy day tomorrow.

13:14.735 --> 13:16.054
Everybody hit the racks.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.410
Lights out.

13:17.935 --> 13:21.245
- Lights out.
- You like being in control, boy?

13:21.975 --> 13:24.443
I ain't took no shower.
I gotta take one.

13:28.615 --> 13:29.764
God, shut up.

13:29.975 --> 13:33.650
I don't fuck with you when you're
talking, so don't fuck with me.

13:35.455 --> 13:36.649
Sergeant Thomas.

13:37.695 --> 13:40.846
Private Cantwell reporting
to the weapon shed as ordered.

13:42.295 --> 13:43.648
Sergeant Thomas?

14:18.895 --> 14:21.045
Glad you waited up for me, Dad.

14:21.495 --> 14:23.326
I think everybody did, Bozz.

14:23.895 --> 14:27.570
This the scene where the troublemaker
gets beaten by his buddies?

14:27.815 --> 14:29.294
Somebody got beaten.

14:30.695 --> 14:31.844
Cantwell.

14:37.495 --> 14:38.894
Jesus!

14:39.375 --> 14:41.935
- What happened?
- I think it was Sergeant Thomas.

14:42.135 --> 14:43.124
Damn it.

14:43.935 --> 14:44.924
Anybody report it?

14:45.175 --> 14:48.247
Why? It's not gonna put
his face back together.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.650
He was trying
to fuck around like you.

14:52.295 --> 14:54.172
I'm sorry this happened to you.

14:54.415 --> 14:57.293
There ain't gonna be
no more clowning from you.

14:57.495 --> 14:59.850
You hear?
Go wash up and hit the rack.

15:00.055 --> 15:03.445
Shut your cake-hole, Miter.
You're giving Cantwell a headache.

15:04.415 --> 15:08.124
I'm telling you, and that's like
getting an order from the sergeant.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.445
Don't make me put you on report.

15:10.695 --> 15:13.732
Give it a rest.
It's been a hard day for all of us.

15:13.975 --> 15:16.933
Don't you give me a hard time, Paxton.
You're okay.

15:17.175 --> 15:19.848
You'll be a good soldier,
but this individual...

15:20.255 --> 15:24.453
He wants to be a bumblefuck.
He wants to laugh at everything we do.

15:24.695 --> 15:26.287
He'll hurt this platoon.

15:26.495 --> 15:28.247
What are you, 20 years old?

15:28.495 --> 15:32.329
Just because you wear sergeant stripes
don't mean you ain't gonna die.

15:32.535 --> 15:34.844
Where you going that we ain't, Bozz?

15:35.775 --> 15:39.404
You best start to soldiering, boy,
or you're coming home in a bag.

16:09.455 --> 16:10.444
Fuck.

16:18.535 --> 16:22.369
Just wanted you to know,
I've taken a great dislike to you.

16:22.575 --> 16:25.248
- Is there anything else, Wilson?
- No.

16:26.015 --> 16:27.334
I don't reckon there is.

16:54.975 --> 16:58.968
I'm gonna tell you something.
This is the last time you'll hear it.

16:59.215 --> 17:01.445
You can't kill a dink with a ricochet.

17:01.655 --> 17:04.646
Oh, this is all about killing people?
Well, shit.

17:14.895 --> 17:16.851
So you can shoot when you want to.

17:17.095 --> 17:18.448
When I want to.

17:18.694 --> 17:20.685
Idea of killing dinks excite you?

17:22.295 --> 17:24.251
Cease fire. Cease fire.

17:24.655 --> 17:27.044
Get your targets, scumbags.

17:28.454 --> 17:29.854
All clear.

17:32.295 --> 17:35.048
You can't hit your targets,
there'll be hell to pay.

17:36.135 --> 17:39.684
Shit, I do believe that's
Cantwell's target there, boys.

17:39.935 --> 17:44.167
- Not a single bullet hole in it.
- Shut your cracker face, Wilson.

17:44.375 --> 17:46.650
Sgt. Thomas'll chew my ass for chow.

17:46.855 --> 17:49.449
You ain't gonna be making
any phone calls home.

17:49.695 --> 17:54.132
You gonna be busy. All asses and
elbows, picking up ciggie butts.

17:54.335 --> 17:57.088
You're a one-man campaign
to make the world uglier.

17:57.495 --> 18:00.726
- I ain't afraid of you, Bozz.
- Yes, you are, Wilson.

18:00.975 --> 18:04.729
- You're just too stupid to realize it.
- Okay then, Sunday school.

18:04.975 --> 18:08.251
You're such a goddamn saint,
give Cantwell your target.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.413
- I'll give him yours.
- You take that and I'Il...

18:11.615 --> 18:14.812
Jesus H. Christ, what's
the purpose of this clusterfuck?

18:15.015 --> 18:17.848
- Wilson switched targets with Cantwell.
- That's true.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.488
- That's bullshit.
- Lie down.

18:19.735 --> 18:21.487
- Permission to...
- Now, shitbird!

18:21.735 --> 18:23.054
Yes, sergeant.

18:23.455 --> 18:27.050
You know why this man's on the ground?
Because he's dead!

18:27.375 --> 18:29.047
He's dead.

18:29.615 --> 18:31.924
And you can't bury him.
Do you know why?

18:32.135 --> 18:34.285
- Why, sarge?
- Because you're dead too!

18:34.935 --> 18:36.254
You're all dead...

18:36.455 --> 18:39.845
...because you don't know how
to fire weapons on semi-automatic.

18:40.575 --> 18:42.645
Or how to hit Charlie
with short bursts...

18:42.855 --> 18:45.449
...so your goddamn barrels
don't overheat.

18:45.695 --> 18:48.926
And because this shitbag
can't hit his fucking target.

18:49.175 --> 18:50.528
Any questions?

18:50.735 --> 18:52.532
- No, sergeant.
- I got a question.

18:52.775 --> 18:55.448
If I'm dead, how come
I can ask you a question?

18:56.495 --> 18:59.453
I know exactly what you're doing,
you pissant fairy.

19:00.255 --> 19:01.449
I want you...

19:03.775 --> 19:05.572
...and your two girlfriends here...

19:05.815 --> 19:08.648
...to report to the mess sergeant
after chow tonight.

19:09.495 --> 19:10.484
Get up, Lazarus.

19:11.015 --> 19:12.448
You're resurrected.

19:14.335 --> 19:15.688
Get up.

19:16.935 --> 19:17.924
Cantwell.

19:34.095 --> 19:36.450
You're getting a lot less funny, Bozz.

19:37.575 --> 19:39.850
There's some big old
moon shining down.

19:40.615 --> 19:42.845
Reminds you what this
world is all about.

19:43.095 --> 19:46.565
- What, peeling potatoes?
- It's good you talk so slow, Cantwell.

19:46.815 --> 19:48.726
Paxton there is taking notes.

19:48.975 --> 19:50.647
Maybe he'll put you in a book.

19:50.855 --> 19:54.052
Another one of his hokey characters:
The bumpkin saint.

19:54.695 --> 19:57.255
I don't rightly know
what you're talking about.

19:57.495 --> 19:59.053
I don't read much.

20:02.495 --> 20:04.645
Never got past sixth grade.

20:04.975 --> 20:07.853
Got married. Got a wife back home.

20:08.775 --> 20:09.924
Poor little girl.

20:10.175 --> 20:11.847
She has seizures.

20:12.335 --> 20:13.529
These spells, you know?

20:13.775 --> 20:16.608
Four children gotta go
without a mama now and again.

20:16.815 --> 20:20.251
Jesus, Cantwell, when did you get
married? When you were 12?

20:21.575 --> 20:22.610
Hell, no.

20:22.815 --> 20:23.930
I was 15.

20:25.015 --> 20:28.371
We had two together.
She had two previous.

20:28.575 --> 20:31.169
I'm 19, but she's a might older.
She's 28.

20:31.415 --> 20:35.044
I got a little boy who's 1
and a little girl who's 2.

20:35.255 --> 20:37.450
What the fuck are you doing here, man?

20:41.655 --> 20:44.647
Don't it strike you how
it's the same moon shining?

20:45.095 --> 20:47.245
And it's shining down on us here...

20:47.495 --> 20:50.646
...and shining down on
that little girl who's my wife.

20:51.415 --> 20:52.643
It's the same moon...

20:52.895 --> 20:55.045
...that'll be shining
when we go to war.

20:55.695 --> 20:59.085
Same moon that's shining down on
those boys getting shot.

20:59.695 --> 21:01.651
Don't it strike you what it means?

21:02.655 --> 21:05.010
How each of us is a bit of everything.

21:05.775 --> 21:08.050
And everything is shit.

21:10.615 --> 21:11.889
I know that back home...

21:12.135 --> 21:14.649
...preacher be talking about
right and wrong.

21:15.335 --> 21:18.247
About the Lord and God and Jesus.

21:18.695 --> 21:19.844
But you know...

21:20.415 --> 21:22.849
...if the Lord or God or Jesus...

21:23.055 --> 21:25.250
...be standing here right now...

21:25.855 --> 21:27.368
...he'd say, "Cantwell...

21:28.855 --> 21:32.165
...you forget about
all these promises.

21:32.855 --> 21:35.244
You forget about what all anybody say.

21:35.815 --> 21:39.251
And you forget about all them
big Sunday fancy ideas.

21:39.855 --> 21:41.254
Even what we tell you.

21:43.655 --> 21:44.849
You look up there.

21:47.255 --> 21:49.052
Did you ever see such a moon?"

21:51.415 --> 21:53.053
Goddamn it, Cantwell.

21:54.655 --> 21:55.644
Shit.

21:58.095 --> 21:59.608
Shit.

21:59.815 --> 22:02.249
Fuck, I don't even know you, man.

22:02.695 --> 22:05.084
You sitting there
telling your fucking story.

22:08.215 --> 22:11.048
Make me want to fucking cry.
What's that about?

22:11.455 --> 22:15.243
I mean, fuck you, Cantwell.
The world is fucking made of pain.

22:16.695 --> 22:18.845
You shouldn't even be in this army.

22:20.735 --> 22:23.044
You're just too stupid
to get yourself out.

22:23.335 --> 22:25.053
I told them my predicament.

22:25.575 --> 22:28.214
They said, "Wait till you go
to war, then complain."

22:28.535 --> 22:30.093
And you bought that?

22:30.455 --> 22:31.604
The man said it.

22:31.815 --> 22:34.932
I know Army regulations
the way prisoners know the law.

22:35.135 --> 22:37.012
You're a hardship discharge, man.

22:40.215 --> 22:43.332
Okay. Look, I'll get you
out of the Army.

22:43.535 --> 22:46.049
What are you saying?
You don't care about him.

22:46.295 --> 22:49.412
Jim, shut the fuck up.
I know what I'm doing here.

22:49.615 --> 22:52.129
Just peel some
fucking potatoes or something.

22:55.215 --> 22:57.331
- One, two, three.
- Two.

22:57.535 --> 22:59.287
- One, two, three.
- Three.

22:59.495 --> 23:01.531
- One, two, three.
- Four.

23:01.735 --> 23:04.124
- One, two, three.
- Five.

23:16.735 --> 23:18.373
Who put you up to this, son?

23:18.575 --> 23:20.247
Nobody, sir.

23:20.895 --> 23:22.806
- I know my rights.
- No, you don't.

23:23.015 --> 23:26.849
Your case won't be reviewed until
after you're overseas. Dismissed.

23:28.735 --> 23:31.727
No, sir.
I don't believe that's correct.

23:31.935 --> 23:35.530
And I believe if you don't allow me
to see a J.A.G. Officer, sir...

23:35.735 --> 23:38.454
...then under the uniform code
of military justice...

23:38.655 --> 23:41.453
...I can file a complaint
with the inspector general.

23:41.695 --> 23:42.969
And nobody can keep me.

23:43.615 --> 23:45.048
Jesus Christ!

23:45.255 --> 23:48.531
When did "My country, right or wrong"
turn into "Fuck this"?

23:48.735 --> 23:52.045
It's Private Bozz, sir.
I can smell him from here.

23:52.935 --> 23:55.449
No, sir, it wasn't Bozz.

23:55.855 --> 23:58.050
I read it. In a book.

24:02.495 --> 24:04.929
You read it? In a book?

24:05.695 --> 24:07.048
Yes, sir.

24:07.455 --> 24:09.252
How far did you get in school?

24:10.255 --> 24:12.246
Almost sixth grade, sir.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.845
I guess they study law early
where you come from.

24:19.575 --> 24:21.167
<i>Sir, if I may speak frankly.</i>

24:21.375 --> 24:24.173
You underestimate the harm
someone like Bozz can do.

24:24.375 --> 24:25.854
He's bad for the Army, sir.

24:26.055 --> 24:30.048
Haven't you heard? Everything's bad
for the Army these days. Even war.

24:30.255 --> 24:34.646
Now drive your knee through his face.
Shove his brain through his ear. Good!

24:34.855 --> 24:36.254
Thank you, sir.

24:36.655 --> 24:39.488
What's your solution?
Shit-can him out of the Army?

24:39.735 --> 24:41.885
Of course not. That's what he wants.

24:42.095 --> 24:43.847
- Exactly.
- Court-martial him.

24:44.055 --> 24:45.886
I guarantee he'll snap shit then.

24:46.095 --> 24:48.529
Sergeant, you know we won't
court-martial him.

24:48.735 --> 24:50.532
It'll cost beaucoup dollars...

24:50.735 --> 24:54.523
...and battalion will ask why I can't
keep one asshole trainee in line.

24:54.735 --> 24:57.488
Five weeks from now,
he'll be in the war.

24:57.695 --> 25:01.005
And he'll soldier then, by God.
Good or bad. Sure as shit.

25:01.215 --> 25:04.525
Maybe not. Got Cantwell out.
Two other guys from his squad.

25:04.735 --> 25:09.126
Every son of a bitch J.A.G. Shrink
bleeding heart pissed down on us.

25:09.335 --> 25:10.324
That's Bozz, sir.

25:10.535 --> 25:13.003
X-ray vision for loopholes in the ARs.

25:13.215 --> 25:15.251
Sergeant, we are losing a war.

25:15.535 --> 25:18.447
The whole goddamn Army
is falling apart.

25:18.655 --> 25:22.364
You want me to fiddle-fuck around
with one smart-ass barracks lawyer?

25:22.575 --> 25:24.452
I think he's something more, sir.

25:25.895 --> 25:28.045
- Is that all, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

25:30.535 --> 25:33.845
What the hell you doing, soldier?!
Goddamn it, Bozz!

25:34.055 --> 25:37.365
You're supposed to strangle him,
not become his fuck buddy!

25:37.575 --> 25:38.849
Yes, sergeant.

26:07.055 --> 26:08.773
Pussy-fucking-coward.

26:10.135 --> 26:13.525
What the fuck you looking at,
you bunch of no-nut sad sacks?

26:13.735 --> 26:16.203
Get your little pussies back to work!

26:19.535 --> 26:23.494
You try that again,
you're gonna be pissing blood, Bozz.

26:27.415 --> 26:29.929
Now get those little pussies
back to work...

26:30.135 --> 26:33.252
...you bunch of sad sack,
no-nut fuck-ups!

26:34.295 --> 26:36.286
Hey, Bozz, you did well by Cantwell.

26:36.535 --> 26:40.289
He's two-stepping from the poorhouse
with a crazy wife. I envy him.

26:40.495 --> 26:41.848
You saved his life.

26:42.055 --> 26:44.888
Shit, sometimes when we talk,
my stomach hurts.

26:45.095 --> 26:47.848
I don't care what you say.
You should feel good.

26:48.295 --> 26:50.126
Good shit, pussy-fucking-coward.

26:50.335 --> 26:52.530
I won't be proud until Wilson's out.

26:52.735 --> 26:55.124
Know what would settle your ass?
A blanket party.

26:55.335 --> 26:57.803
Put a blanket over you,
hit you with a rock.

26:58.015 --> 27:00.654
Shut up, Wilson.
I'll stop this damn truck.

27:00.855 --> 27:03.164
- Both of you can walk back...
- You bastard...

27:03.375 --> 27:05.252
...you think you so damn smart.

27:05.455 --> 27:08.253
I hear Northern boys
are the first to go in Vietnam.

27:08.455 --> 27:11.049
Yeah, but at least
we can find it on a map.

27:12.055 --> 27:13.408
Real fucking funny, Pax.

27:13.615 --> 27:16.448
Ain't nobody gonna die.
Keep that talk to yourself.

27:16.655 --> 27:20.330
Ain't nobody gonna die? Shit, Miter,
you're one damn dumb cracker.

27:20.535 --> 27:23.925
When you go home, they'll call you
"Mr. No-Legs Motherfucker."

27:24.135 --> 27:26.729
- That any better?
- You watch yourself, mister.

27:26.935 --> 27:29.290
I still got these stripes.
Acting sarge.

27:29.495 --> 27:32.407
You're chicken without
that stripe down your back.

27:32.615 --> 27:36.608
- I ain't seen a dink that can take me.
- Jesus, Wilson, you a dumb-fuck.

27:36.815 --> 27:39.204
Them motherfuckers
killed the Chinese ass...

27:39.415 --> 27:41.770
...and the French ass.
They gonna kick ours.

27:41.975 --> 27:46.685
- Who are you? "Ask Mr. Negro Wizard"?
- My brother was there in '68.

27:46.935 --> 27:48.288
Don't make you no hero.

27:48.495 --> 27:50.645
You know what your problem is, Wilson?

27:51.535 --> 27:53.014
You need to listen for the pop.

27:53.215 --> 27:55.046
What's "the pop," Johnson?

27:57.535 --> 28:01.847
The sound you'll make when your head
exits your ass for the first time.

28:03.095 --> 28:06.053
Damn, Johnson,
I know you a damn coward.

28:06.255 --> 28:08.485
Now I believe you a damn communist.

28:08.695 --> 28:12.085
Maybe a damn faggot alongside
being a goddamn nigger.

28:12.295 --> 28:14.650
- Oh, hell no!
- Ain't this some shit.

28:16.735 --> 28:19.727
- Want a piece of me, chump?
- Get him!

28:19.935 --> 28:21.527
- Get him!
- Get off of me.

28:24.695 --> 28:26.174
Get off, motherfucker!

28:26.375 --> 28:27.444
Come on!

28:28.735 --> 28:30.054
That's enough.

28:38.255 --> 28:40.894
Which one of you motherfuckers
killed my truck?

28:41.095 --> 28:42.687
- Get off me, man!
- Get off!

28:42.895 --> 28:45.773
All right, now, you truckload of shit.

28:46.015 --> 28:48.529
Fess up, or the whole
damn drag-ass squad...

28:48.735 --> 28:51.852
...does the airborne shuffle
six miles back to base.

28:53.255 --> 28:55.894
Goddamn it, shit for brains!
Who did it?

29:00.135 --> 29:01.568
I did it, sergeant.

29:01.775 --> 29:03.367
Good. Come down here, boy.

29:03.655 --> 29:05.247
And bring your shit!

29:08.655 --> 29:11.044
Rest of you, sit your asses down.

29:31.615 --> 29:34.732
Nobody saves anybody,
you stupid son of a bitch.

29:34.935 --> 29:36.971
What the fuck are you doing, man?

29:37.215 --> 29:39.251
It's not doing me any favors.

29:46.575 --> 29:48.770
Charlie 6, this is Charlie 2.

29:48.975 --> 29:51.330
Miter has properly demonstrated...

29:51.535 --> 29:55.050
...the use of the TA-312 field radio.

29:55.415 --> 29:59.044
Except for this,
which is not in the manual.

30:00.015 --> 30:01.846
If you ever catch Charlie...

30:02.055 --> 30:05.127
...you might want info on where
the rest of his buddies is.

30:05.335 --> 30:09.886
Only Charlie is a close-lipped
bastard who won't tell you fuck all.

30:10.135 --> 30:13.764
That's why you tie his gook hands,
take down his gook pants...

30:14.015 --> 30:16.449
...and grab his gook balls.

30:17.055 --> 30:18.613
Here, Miter, hold these.

30:18.815 --> 30:21.887
You pinch these clips on each
of his slant-eyed nuts...

30:22.255 --> 30:24.450
...and you juice up the radio...

30:27.975 --> 30:31.490
...that'll send enough shock so
he'll tell you anything you want.

30:31.695 --> 30:34.812
Hell, he'll tell you
the minor league baseball scores.

30:35.015 --> 30:36.687
- You read me?
- Yes, sergeant.

30:36.895 --> 30:41.525
He'll tell you how his mother wipes
her ass if you give him this juice.

30:41.735 --> 30:45.648
Not only that, you'll be able
to find him real easy next time.

30:45.855 --> 30:48.449
Because he'll light up
the fucking night.

30:57.015 --> 30:58.733
No one said you could leave.

30:59.495 --> 31:01.292
- Why?
- Why what?

31:01.495 --> 31:03.850
Why would I do that
to another human being?

31:07.655 --> 31:08.929
Brother's right.

31:09.135 --> 31:12.252
What the fuck's wrong with you?
That's one of your men.

31:12.775 --> 31:14.128
Get him back here, boy.

31:14.335 --> 31:15.563
- Bozz!
- Go get him, boy.

31:15.775 --> 31:17.254
Jesus, Bozz.

31:17.735 --> 31:19.134
Don't do this to me.

31:19.335 --> 31:22.532
Get back here,
you worthless sack of shit!

31:26.535 --> 31:29.607
You can't control your own men,
it is your ass.

31:29.815 --> 31:31.248
Drop trou.

31:32.295 --> 31:34.013
- What?
- Drop trou!

31:36.175 --> 31:38.484
Double-time, come on! Skivvies too.

31:40.295 --> 31:44.049
Well, what do you know?
You do have a pair of balls after all.

31:44.535 --> 31:47.049
Wilson, get over here.
Crank this thing.

31:47.575 --> 31:49.611
We'll now demonstrate
the proper way...

31:49.815 --> 31:53.046
...to give information
when connected to the TA-312.

31:53.255 --> 31:56.247
See if you can tell me
why you can't control your men.

31:56.735 --> 31:58.851
See if you light up tonight.

32:01.495 --> 32:03.531
- Light him up.
- Shut the fuck up, Hicks.

32:03.735 --> 32:04.804
Contact.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.932
Never even touched you, son.

32:15.095 --> 32:18.644
That's it. Class dismissed.
Go on to your next class.

32:19.015 --> 32:20.243
Go on.

32:21.495 --> 32:22.848
Go on!

32:26.415 --> 32:30.124
Wilson, looks like we're having
roasted nuts tonight, huh?

32:30.335 --> 32:32.769
I didn't know you
was so goddamn funny.

32:59.495 --> 33:02.771
I can't wait to catch me a VC,
spark his balls off.

33:03.375 --> 33:05.127
I'll start with you tonight, Miter.

33:05.335 --> 33:07.724
Got this, Pax?
The crazed, sadistic soldier...

33:07.975 --> 33:09.374
...who flips out and kills people.

33:09.575 --> 33:11.725
I think I saw you look at
Miter's balls earlier.

33:11.935 --> 33:13.846
Funny there, Bozz. Funny, yeah.

33:14.055 --> 33:17.411
You're a disgrace to the uniform,
fucking piece of shit!

33:17.615 --> 33:19.526
Hey! Hey, what the fuck?

33:22.095 --> 33:23.005
Break it up, man!

33:25.575 --> 33:27.691
Get the fuck up! Civilian bullshit!

33:28.775 --> 33:31.130
What the hell is going on? Miter!

33:31.335 --> 33:34.611
You better do some fast explaining
or your men in a world of hurt.

33:34.855 --> 33:36.447
There was an argument...

33:36.655 --> 33:39.931
...and one of the men...
...- Slipped on the soap in the shower.

33:40.135 --> 33:42.012
Wrestling. It got out of hand.

33:42.215 --> 33:45.013
It happens when people live together,
fuck together.

33:48.815 --> 33:52.012
Sorry, soldier, you must've
slipped on some soap yourself.

33:52.455 --> 33:53.490
What's wrong with you?

33:53.735 --> 33:56.807
Look like you ate some frozen shit
for breakfast.

33:59.735 --> 34:02.010
Nothing's wrong, sergeant.

34:02.255 --> 34:05.247
It better stay that way,
you read me? All of you.

34:06.535 --> 34:10.005
- Goddamn it, do you hear me?
- Yes, sergeant!

34:10.855 --> 34:15.132
You got guard duty. Four listening
posts at the edge of the perimeter.

34:15.335 --> 34:17.610
Dig yourself a hole and
forget about chow.

34:19.935 --> 34:23.610
Out here, you're challenged on guard
duty. And you do it by the book.

34:23.855 --> 34:26.494
But in Nam, if you hear something
in the bushes...

34:26.735 --> 34:28.726
...I mean anything, you open fire.

34:28.935 --> 34:32.324
You fire into those bushes until
you kill whatever made that sound.

34:32.574 --> 34:35.043
When the sun comes up,
I don't give a fuck...

34:35.255 --> 34:38.371
...whether it's man, woman, child
or little Johnny next door.

34:38.574 --> 34:40.690
Kill it or you're not coming home.

34:40.895 --> 34:42.647
Like the My Lai massacre, sergeant?

34:46.574 --> 34:47.724
Paxton...

34:47.935 --> 34:50.210
...why don't you join
your asshole buddy?

34:50.655 --> 34:53.806
Missing a meal would be good for
your wisecracking ass also.

34:56.775 --> 34:58.572
Now let's fall back in for chow!

34:58.775 --> 35:02.245
Goddamn it, do it now!
You want to march six miles tonight?

35:02.455 --> 35:04.093
Fucking weapons at ease!

35:06.215 --> 35:09.013
Feel like I'm digging
my own fucking grave here.

35:10.655 --> 35:12.213
When I was a kid...

35:12.975 --> 35:15.205
...I used to think I could
dig my way to China.

35:15.575 --> 35:18.009
You watched too many cartoons, Jim.

35:18.455 --> 35:22.733
Maybe if we dig long and hard enough,
we'll tunnel our way out of this dump.

35:22.935 --> 35:24.209
Why don't you?

35:25.255 --> 35:26.813
My arm's too tired.

35:27.575 --> 35:31.011
No, really. Why don't you get
yourself out of the Army?

35:32.055 --> 35:33.613
I'm not that brave.

35:36.015 --> 35:39.610
In that case, I'll just have to
bury you myself!

36:41.895 --> 36:44.011
Move it out! Come on, move it out!

36:46.375 --> 36:47.490
Stay the fuck down!

36:51.135 --> 36:52.568
Stay the fuck where you are!

36:52.775 --> 36:54.333
Move! You got to move it!

36:54.535 --> 36:57.572
Stay the fuck down!
They're firing in our path!

37:00.575 --> 37:02.247
- Move it!
- Cease fire.

37:02.455 --> 37:04.013
Miter! What the hell's
wrong with you?

37:04.615 --> 37:07.129
When your men are told to move out,
they move out!

37:07.375 --> 37:09.127
When I give orders,
you're supposed to jump.

37:09.375 --> 37:10.888
- Do you read me?
- Yes, sergeant!

37:11.135 --> 37:14.605
The M-60s fired directly across
our path! They'd have cut us in two!

37:14.855 --> 37:18.450
Who told you to open your fucking
mouth? Miter's platoon guide!

37:18.695 --> 37:21.607
You gotta flank that M-60!
Is that clear?

37:22.495 --> 37:23.291
Yes, sir.

37:23.495 --> 37:25.611
If you want these
dumb-ass bitches dead...

37:25.855 --> 37:27.811
...you wouldn't take them
in the belly of a pig...

37:28.055 --> 37:29.886
...with a 762 to split their skull!

37:30.135 --> 37:32.091
You flank the objective!

37:32.335 --> 37:33.734
- You read me?
- Yes, sergeant!

37:33.975 --> 37:36.773
- Get these fucking men out the hole!
- Move it out!

37:36.975 --> 37:38.647
Stay down! Stay down!

37:39.855 --> 37:41.049
Stay down!

37:41.255 --> 37:43.723
What did you say, maggot-brained
son of a bitch?!

37:43.935 --> 37:44.970
I said, stay down.

37:45.335 --> 37:46.893
Get these men out the hole now!

37:47.135 --> 37:49.933
- Platoon guide, do it! Move it!
- Come on, goddamn it!

37:51.135 --> 37:52.011
Stay down.

37:52.215 --> 37:54.683
Are you stupid enough
to fuck with me, boy?

37:55.255 --> 37:57.485
Tomorrow at base
it's you, me and the captain.

37:57.735 --> 38:00.932
If your insubordinate ass ain't
in stockade by midday chow...

38:01.135 --> 38:02.887
...I'll kill you myself!

38:04.855 --> 38:06.811
You won't kill me, sergeant.

38:07.655 --> 38:10.408
I don't know what you'll do to me,
but you won't kill me.

38:15.575 --> 38:17.805
- Goddamn you, boy!
- Out of the trench!

38:18.055 --> 38:19.454
Don't turn your back on me!

38:19.655 --> 38:21.930
Get your ass with the other men now!

38:22.135 --> 38:25.207
I understand your position. I ain't
trying to fuck things up for you.

38:25.455 --> 38:28.811
You got your army to run and people
to kill. I'm not part of it.

38:29.055 --> 38:30.488
Nobody quits the Army.

38:30.735 --> 38:32.009
I'm not quitting...

38:32.215 --> 38:34.251
...I'm just not playing.

38:34.495 --> 38:36.406
What's your first name, sergeant?

38:38.055 --> 38:39.124
Ezra.

38:39.575 --> 38:40.803
Ezra.

38:41.135 --> 38:42.568
Can I offer you a smoke?

38:48.135 --> 38:50.251
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

38:50.455 --> 38:52.810
That doesn't fucking do it!

38:53.055 --> 38:54.693
That doesn't fucking do it!

38:54.935 --> 38:57.210
Give me a fucking answer!

38:57.615 --> 38:58.809
Fuck!

38:59.655 --> 39:01.805
Now you listen to me, son.

39:03.415 --> 39:05.326
I been to where you're going.

39:05.535 --> 39:08.447
Over there, you go from
living to dead awful quick.

39:08.655 --> 39:12.330
What I'm trying to teach you may
save your worthless life, maybe.

39:12.575 --> 39:16.727
I tell you what. If you snap shit
and soldier like I know you can...

39:16.935 --> 39:19.529
...I'll forget about this.
- Can't.

39:19.735 --> 39:23.011
Shit, even if I wanted to,
I'm not there anymore.

39:23.775 --> 39:25.845
What kind of bullshit
statement is this?

39:26.215 --> 39:27.443
Ezra, no.

39:27.655 --> 39:29.213
It's just me.

39:30.655 --> 39:32.407
Okay, Bozz, all right.

39:32.735 --> 39:34.168
I'm gonna let you go.

39:34.375 --> 39:36.809
But now it's you
and the CO, I'm out of it.

39:37.055 --> 39:41.651
Soldier, this army's gonna come down
on your ass hard. Both feet.

39:41.895 --> 39:43.374
You know that, don't you?

39:43.575 --> 39:47.409
They'll push through your papers
and send you where the dying's sweet.

39:48.855 --> 39:50.208
Is this a trick?

39:53.015 --> 39:55.609
Trying to make me a hero
or something?

39:57.775 --> 39:58.764
Nope.

40:00.535 --> 40:01.968
Well, good, Ezra.

40:02.455 --> 40:05.606
Now you get your ass up and
join these men right now.

40:06.415 --> 40:09.532
You're a big fucking baby!
Get out of my sight.

40:15.815 --> 40:17.806
- Miter!
- What's he doing?

40:18.455 --> 40:21.174
- Sergeant Landers!
- Goddamn it, what is it now?

40:34.135 --> 40:38.606
- That's enough, sergeant.
- You got some fucking nerve, shitbag!

40:44.655 --> 40:45.451
Come on!

40:45.655 --> 40:48.215
Time to go home, soldier!

40:49.055 --> 40:51.011
I said, that's enough!

40:51.895 --> 40:53.010
Let's go.

41:01.855 --> 41:04.415
Goddamn it, you men will
learn to soldier.

41:04.655 --> 41:08.330
The next dick tries a stunt like that
gets my size-14 Deltas...

41:08.535 --> 41:11.174
...so far up their ass
they'll choke on the heel!

41:11.455 --> 41:14.811
- Do you understand!
- Yes, sergeant!

41:16.055 --> 41:17.807
You! Paxton!

41:18.575 --> 41:21.135
- How much school have you had?
- Two years of college.

41:21.335 --> 41:24.008
You're the next platoon guide.
Arrest him.

41:24.215 --> 41:26.410
They didn't teach us
how to do that in college.

41:26.615 --> 41:29.732
Are you some kind of fucking idiot?
You inbred retard.

41:29.975 --> 41:32.011
You don't know how to do a thing,
do you?

41:32.215 --> 41:34.046
Tell the man he's under arrest...

41:34.295 --> 41:37.014
...he's confined to barracks,
he won't leave the area.

41:37.215 --> 41:40.013
You get a card table
and set it up at the door!

41:40.255 --> 41:41.449
Why, sergeant?

41:41.655 --> 41:45.330
So a guard can sit there, you
backed-up, sperm-brained college boy.

41:45.535 --> 41:48.003
You're fired as platoon guide,
dumb-ass dipshit!

41:51.255 --> 41:52.608
You think that's funny?!

41:52.815 --> 41:53.611
Goddamn it!

41:53.855 --> 41:57.211
Goddamn it! Give me 10, you
think it's fucking funny!

41:59.775 --> 42:02.005
- Wilson!
- Yes, sergeant.

42:02.415 --> 42:04.007
Get a card table.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.324
You're on guard.

42:09.375 --> 42:10.694
Guard, sergeant?

42:10.895 --> 42:13.011
You heard me!
You want these 14s up your ass?

42:13.255 --> 42:14.608
No, sergeant!

42:20.935 --> 42:22.050
Bozz.

42:22.255 --> 42:23.483
You're new platoon guide.

42:24.815 --> 42:27.409
You put that piece of shit
under arrest.

42:27.655 --> 42:31.204
You tell these men to get their
haircuts. Every swinging dick.

42:31.455 --> 42:33.605
Congratulations, sweetheart.

42:34.935 --> 42:36.527
Sorry about that, Jim.

42:36.735 --> 42:37.884
Oh, man.

42:38.135 --> 42:38.965
Jealous?

42:40.055 --> 42:40.851
Miter.

42:41.055 --> 42:42.613
How you doing, man?

42:49.935 --> 42:50.811
Okay, guys!

42:51.055 --> 42:53.933
I ain't taking any of this
shit seriously.

42:54.175 --> 42:57.406
Just do what you have to do
so we can live together.

42:57.655 --> 43:00.123
If any of you are gonna run off
and hide, let me know.

43:00.335 --> 43:02.485
You can't do this.
You ain't got the rights.

43:02.695 --> 43:06.051
Bleeding-heart son of a bitch.
It ain't your army. Hear me?

43:06.255 --> 43:08.928
Sit the fuck down at your
dumb card table, punk.

43:09.815 --> 43:11.373
Hey, fellas. Hey!

43:11.775 --> 43:15.131
Look, all I know is that no one's
talked to me like that...

43:15.375 --> 43:18.924
...since I got in this goddamned
green mean machine.

43:19.215 --> 43:20.967
- Damn right.
- I attest to that.

43:21.175 --> 43:24.406
So yeah, Bozz.
See what happens, baby.

43:24.655 --> 43:27.886
What else they gonna do, send us
to Viet-fucking-Nam?

43:28.135 --> 43:29.170
Too late for that.

43:32.175 --> 43:34.609
Say, Bozz? Can I get a weekend pass?

43:34.815 --> 43:37.409
Put your panties away,
your mama's panties.

43:38.295 --> 43:41.605
They're your mama's panties. You
ain't been laid in three years.

43:42.335 --> 43:44.610
Get me off this base, I'll show you!

43:45.975 --> 43:50.014
Miter, baby, you gotta lay still.
Gotta lay still, man.

43:50.655 --> 43:51.770
Take a deep breath.

43:53.895 --> 43:55.408
Take this shit off.

43:59.855 --> 44:01.413
You gotta relax.

44:50.535 --> 44:52.730
Shit, you gonna run again?

44:52.935 --> 44:55.495
I hear people in New Orleans
help me get to Mexico.

44:55.695 --> 44:56.605
It ain't that easy.

44:56.815 --> 44:59.409
Army's got men, their whole job's
to look for you.

44:59.655 --> 45:00.804
I don't care.

45:01.015 --> 45:04.007
They'll catch you, bring you here
and put you in prison.

45:05.335 --> 45:08.133
You best move, don't make me
have to thump you.

45:08.335 --> 45:10.974
Want to go to military prison?
You're not that crazy.

45:15.855 --> 45:17.083
Shut the fuck up!

45:18.055 --> 45:21.411
Calm the fuck down, you'll wake
up Wilson. You don't want that.

45:35.015 --> 45:36.812
Shit. What you gonna do now?

45:37.055 --> 45:39.205
I'll bust my hand.
I'll bust my hand.

45:39.455 --> 45:41.650
- Shit, man, that won't work.
- Watch!

45:41.855 --> 45:43.004
I said, that won't work!

45:43.255 --> 45:46.008
Bust my hand, they'll have to
let me out. Right?

45:46.215 --> 45:48.524
- It ain't gonna work.
- Come on, Bozz!

45:48.775 --> 45:51.812
Break my goddamn hand
so I can go home!

46:08.175 --> 46:11.247
You know what I am, Bozz?
I'm a butcher.

46:11.455 --> 46:12.774
Yeah, we all butchers.

46:12.975 --> 46:14.727
No, I'm a real butcher.

46:14.935 --> 46:18.610
- You haven't killed anyone yet.
- Goddamn it, I mean a real butcher!

46:18.855 --> 46:21.653
Back home. I cut meat.
I do it damn fine too.

46:21.895 --> 46:24.568
Did it in high school,
did it after high school.

46:24.975 --> 46:27.728
I could cut you a piece of meat
so clean...

46:27.935 --> 46:30.403
...it'll have you praying
to beefsteak.

46:30.655 --> 46:35.206
I'm a good butcher, Bozz.
It's all I ever wanted to be.

46:41.055 --> 46:42.204
You laughing at me?

46:42.535 --> 46:45.652
No, Miter. I ain't laughing at you.

46:47.855 --> 46:51.006
My wife, she laughed at me.
My daddy too.

46:51.215 --> 46:52.807
I didn't make no money.

46:53.055 --> 46:55.410
Just a store boy,
that's what my daddy said.

46:55.655 --> 46:57.646
"Hey, store boy. Hey, boy!"

46:57.855 --> 47:02.326
Called me boy. Imagine that? Shit
kicker, calling me boy all the time.

47:02.535 --> 47:04.412
I ain't a boy, goddamn it!

47:04.855 --> 47:07.210
Telling me how he's
a big fancy war hero!

47:07.455 --> 47:09.411
And my wife, that little...

47:12.855 --> 47:14.413
My wife.

47:21.295 --> 47:22.728
She's pretty.

47:23.655 --> 47:25.725
Prettiest girl in Lake Charles High.

47:32.135 --> 47:34.808
Prettiest girl
in the state of Louisiana.

47:37.055 --> 47:41.207
She was mad at me because
I was working all the time.

47:41.575 --> 47:43.213
Giving her the money...

47:43.655 --> 47:45.054
...for junior college.

47:46.255 --> 47:48.211
I knowed then, like...

47:48.855 --> 47:50.811
...like I knowed later on...

47:52.055 --> 47:55.411
...she was seeing a fucking
college boy on the side!

47:55.615 --> 47:57.287
Goddamn it! My daddy said it.

47:57.535 --> 48:01.323
He said, "See? See what a dumb-ass
bastard you are?

48:01.575 --> 48:03.884
Blinded by the beaver store, boy.

48:04.135 --> 48:07.093
You ought to have a little ring
in your nose."

48:07.295 --> 48:11.254
So you thought you'd join the Army
and kill yourself like a real man.

48:12.855 --> 48:15.847
Bozz, I know you can get people out.

48:16.455 --> 48:17.808
Maybe.

48:18.215 --> 48:21.605
Even in this wild-ass nonsense,
some rules fly by.

48:22.535 --> 48:26.608
Please, Bozz. Please get me
out of here. Please?

48:46.375 --> 48:47.410
Well, look here.

48:47.615 --> 48:48.843
Goddamn.

48:50.255 --> 48:53.088
That captain sure didn't want
to let me go at first.

48:53.335 --> 48:54.654
But I did like you said.

48:54.855 --> 48:57.415
Told him the Army wants me
to see a psychiatrist.

48:57.655 --> 49:01.204
- And that was it, huh?
- I wanted to thank you personally.

49:01.455 --> 49:02.683
Doctor sent me on leave.

49:02.935 --> 49:06.086
He'll contact the Red Cross,
get me out-processed...

49:06.295 --> 49:07.853
...so I don't have to come back.

49:08.215 --> 49:10.968
Good, Miter. Glad to hear
you're nuts, man.

49:14.415 --> 49:16.610
- Best of luck, Miter.
- Thanks, Paxton.

49:17.935 --> 49:19.414
Take care, Johnson.

49:23.055 --> 49:23.931
Thanks again, Bozz.

49:28.335 --> 49:30.166
- So long.
- Go be a butcher, Miter!

49:30.375 --> 49:34.004
- Try not to get shot, hear?
- Don't let your meat loaf, man.

49:42.495 --> 49:44.167
Yeah, fuck you.

49:53.055 --> 49:56.206
- Private Bozz, reporting as ordered.
- At ease.

49:56.415 --> 49:59.213
So you're the new platoon
guide for 2nd Platoon?

49:59.495 --> 50:00.291
Yes, sir.

50:00.495 --> 50:03.134
The fucking world is full
of fucking surprises.

50:03.495 --> 50:06.168
It wasn't your plan to wear
sergeant's stripes...

50:06.375 --> 50:08.525
...a week away from
Tigerland in a war.

50:08.735 --> 50:12.011
I don't know, sir. The idea
crossed my mind now and again.

50:12.215 --> 50:15.207
I just didn't think it would
all be so pitiful sad.

50:20.615 --> 50:22.526
Been looking over your 201.

50:22.735 --> 50:24.612
You're a Texas boy.

50:25.175 --> 50:28.451
Couple run-ins with the law.
A year in state college.

50:28.655 --> 50:30.213
Dropout, worked construction.

50:30.415 --> 50:32.133
- Get drafted?
- Yes, sir.

50:32.375 --> 50:37.130
- Why didn't you stay in school?
- Maybe I needed some trouble, sir.

50:37.375 --> 50:38.808
Well, you got it.

50:39.535 --> 50:43.289
You also got responsibility.
You got a platoon to run.

50:43.935 --> 50:47.405
The company's like the bad end of a
shit storm. Your platoon's the worst.

50:47.615 --> 50:51.005
- Thank you, sir.
- That's not a compliment, smart-ass.

50:53.175 --> 50:55.484
I don't want any more calls
from battalion...

50:55.695 --> 50:58.004
...asking me why this troopie needs
a hardship discharge...

50:58.255 --> 51:01.008
...and that troopie needs
some kind of a mental wet nurse.

51:01.255 --> 51:03.166
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

51:03.375 --> 51:06.014
Wipe that fucking grin off your face.

51:09.255 --> 51:11.644
A week from now you'll ship out
to Tigerland.

51:11.855 --> 51:14.688
That'll crawl in your skull
and look out your eyes.

51:14.935 --> 51:16.732
So let's start fresh.

51:16.935 --> 51:19.733
- Give your people a weekend pass.
- Already done it, sir.

51:24.855 --> 51:27.813
You are a goddamn piece of work, Bozz.

51:29.015 --> 51:32.166
I believe you could soldier as well
as any man in this army.

51:32.375 --> 51:35.048
I even think you want to,
but you won't.

51:36.015 --> 51:38.210
I'm just trying to keep myself alive.

51:39.055 --> 51:43.970
We're fighting a war, private. Nobody
knows how he's gonna come back.

51:45.255 --> 51:47.974
That's not the kind of alive
I'm talking about, sir.

51:48.295 --> 51:49.808
Here's 150 bucks.

52:03.615 --> 52:05.606
Happy Halloween!

52:08.055 --> 52:09.283
Cough it up, Brian.

52:09.935 --> 52:10.651
Next time, Pax.

52:10.855 --> 52:12.607
- Catch you later, buddy.
- All right.

52:21.335 --> 52:23.405
Who's that girl you're
talking to, Bozz?

52:25.255 --> 52:27.849
- Trying to score some weed.
- Know what I don't get?

52:28.055 --> 52:31.092
Why they haven't tossed you
out on some lunatic discharge...

52:31.295 --> 52:33.525
...some bullshit like that.
- I ain't crazy.

52:33.775 --> 52:35.652
You're out of your fucking mind.

52:35.855 --> 52:39.609
My reasons are my reasons and
no one has to like them.

52:39.815 --> 52:42.613
What about these fucking war games?
What if it's a lie?

52:42.935 --> 52:45.813
What if the guys who tell you and me
shit to do were lied to also?

52:46.455 --> 52:49.891
Maybe since everyone believes
in the same mistake, you know...

52:50.135 --> 52:52.171
...maybe they're all as confused
as we are.

52:52.375 --> 52:55.412
All this "Boy's boy,
man's man" bullshit.

52:55.615 --> 52:57.173
Ever feel you're just being stupid?

52:57.535 --> 53:01.084
Yeah. And it gives me a warm,
gooey feeling inside too.

53:18.655 --> 53:20.930
Oh, man, we need women, Pax!

53:26.335 --> 53:27.563
Oh, I hear you, buddy!

53:27.775 --> 53:30.653
I hear your asshole's tighter
than a migraine.

53:30.855 --> 53:32.811
- Fuck you!
- Hey, man.

53:33.455 --> 53:35.810
- You're Bozz, right?
- Uh-huh.

53:37.655 --> 53:40.533
Fellas say that if you don't
want to go to Nam...

53:40.735 --> 53:43.807
...you better pray to Jesus
or talk to Roland Bozz.

53:44.055 --> 53:47.013
- Better start praying to Jesus, then.
- Sorry, kid!

53:47.415 --> 53:49.406
- Oh, my God, look here.
- Oh, Jesus!

53:49.615 --> 53:52.004
- I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble!
- You are!

53:52.255 --> 53:54.974
- Come here, baby.
- I'll come if you got some money.

53:55.175 --> 53:58.133
- I might have some money.
- You might or you do?

53:58.375 --> 54:01.128
- You better have some.
- That's what I need to see.

54:01.335 --> 54:03.053
- You want to see it?
- Yeah, I do.

54:03.255 --> 54:05.450
- You got me covered, right?
- Here it is.

54:05.655 --> 54:09.443
As I was about to come, I let out a
fart. Should've seen her face.

54:09.655 --> 54:12.692
Heard it in the next room.
Thought a grenade went off.

54:12.895 --> 54:14.806
- How was yours?
- Expensive.

54:15.055 --> 54:17.091
- You feel guilty?
- Because I'm broke?

54:17.335 --> 54:20.611
I figured you for a guy
who left a sweetheart back home.

54:20.815 --> 54:23.170
- She left me.
- That's why you joined the Army.

54:23.375 --> 54:26.924
- Go on, confess.
- No, she broke it off when I enlisted.

54:27.135 --> 54:29.808
- Didn't want to be a widow.
- She's got a point.

54:30.015 --> 54:31.607
After all this bullshit...

54:31.855 --> 54:35.211
...you still want to go kill women
and children in rice paddies?

54:37.535 --> 54:39.730
- Come on, Paxton!
- Where you going, Bozz?

54:39.975 --> 54:42.011
- I have no idea.
- Fuck.

54:42.255 --> 54:46.294
- We are gonna jump, my young friend!
- Shit, Bozz, I'm too drunk.

54:46.495 --> 54:49.009
- Come on, Paxton.
- I'll break my neck.

54:49.215 --> 54:51.604
I don't want to go without you,
man.

54:52.175 --> 54:54.006
All right, I see what this is.

54:54.215 --> 54:57.207
This jump, it's like this
existential leap of faith.

54:57.455 --> 54:59.605
Abso-fucking-lutely.
I have no idea what that means.

54:59.815 --> 55:02.010
We'll break those legs
and get out of the war.

55:02.215 --> 55:04.570
- Okay, let's go.
- That's it, here we go.

55:04.775 --> 55:06.413
- I'm ready.
- That's it.

55:06.655 --> 55:09.852
It's gonna be on my count,
it'll be one, two, three.

55:10.055 --> 55:12.046
- Let's break those legs.
- Okay, one!

55:12.255 --> 55:13.404
Two!

55:13.815 --> 55:15.009
Three!

55:16.455 --> 55:18.810
- Was that the count?
- That was the count.

55:20.455 --> 55:23.208
- Okay, okay.
- Here we go, here we go.

55:23.415 --> 55:25.929
- Hot girl.
- Oh, yeah, hot girl.

55:26.135 --> 55:28.126
On my count again, one, two, three.

55:29.055 --> 55:30.408
Okay, one!

55:30.655 --> 55:32.008
Two!

55:32.335 --> 55:33.609
Three!

55:35.215 --> 55:38.207
The legs won't move. Shit.

55:38.535 --> 55:42.414
They're out for themselves.
Goddamn it.

55:49.175 --> 55:51.814
If that bottle was a leg, we'd be
out of the war about now.

55:52.575 --> 55:56.853
- Looks like that would really hurt.
- Oh, fuck.

56:03.855 --> 56:08.406
Canadian Atlantic Railway.
There's your ride out of here, Bozz.

56:08.615 --> 56:12.403
Go to Canada and live with
a fucking moose? No way, man.

56:12.615 --> 56:16.210
Mexico, that's where I'd disappear to.
Can't you just smell it?

56:16.455 --> 56:18.923
See it? Shit, I can
smell it from here.

56:19.175 --> 56:23.805
All that sunshine and tequila. All
those little <i>señoritas</i> walking around.

56:26.615 --> 56:28.412
- Would you...
- What?

56:28.975 --> 56:31.648
If I told you about people
who can get us to Mexico...

56:31.855 --> 56:34.005
...away from the war, would you go?

56:36.055 --> 56:36.851
No.

56:38.935 --> 56:39.811
No, I wouldn't.

56:40.375 --> 56:43.014
I enlisted, so there's a place for me.

56:44.055 --> 56:46.091
If I don't go, somebody
has to take that place.

56:47.815 --> 56:49.407
And if they die, well...

56:50.215 --> 56:52.012
...they're dying for me.

56:54.335 --> 56:56.007
You're a brave man.

56:56.975 --> 56:59.808
- You're the brave one, Bozz.
- Bullshit.

57:01.655 --> 57:05.807
Courage is when you're the only guy
who knows how shit-scared you are.

57:07.455 --> 57:08.808
Then you're right.

57:09.055 --> 57:10.807
I am the brave one.

57:12.015 --> 57:14.813
Let's get out of here.
We gotta get back.

57:15.055 --> 57:18.206
Fucking Sergeant Thomas
will chew my ass for chow!

57:25.815 --> 57:29.808
- Anytime today, Private Paxton.
- I'm coming, Private Bozz.

57:30.855 --> 57:32.004
Fuck.

57:36.455 --> 57:37.808
We should have jumped.

57:38.015 --> 57:39.209
Yeah.

57:39.815 --> 57:41.407
We can always go back.

57:42.655 --> 57:44.213
Come on, man.

58:21.335 --> 58:22.404
Fight!

58:23.535 --> 58:27.244
Calm the fuck down here!
Calm the fuck down!

58:27.655 --> 58:29.008
Get him, Bozz!

58:31.935 --> 58:33.607
Get him, Bozz, get him!

59:09.495 --> 59:13.010
Let him go! You're gonna hurt
him, Bozz, let him go!

59:13.335 --> 59:14.529
Let him go, Bozz!

59:14.735 --> 59:18.125
Let him go! Come on! Get off!
Goddamn it!

59:29.455 --> 59:32.686
Damn you, Paxton. Let them fight.

59:33.375 --> 59:34.330
Shut the fuck up.

59:34.535 --> 59:36.810
You know he deserved every bit of it!

59:44.295 --> 59:46.809
Took four hours for
my nose to stop bleeding.

59:47.135 --> 59:49.251
Get off it, Wilson!
You had it coming, man!

59:49.455 --> 59:52.811
- I was just fucking with him.
- If Paxton here had kept quiet...

59:53.055 --> 59:55.853
...boy, you'd be in hell right now,
sure as shit!

59:57.655 --> 01:00:00.453
If I knew Bozz would stop,
I wouldn't have said anything.

01:00:01.575 --> 01:00:02.974
Apologize, Bozz.

01:00:03.175 --> 01:00:04.164
Get off it.

01:00:04.375 --> 01:00:05.808
You heard me, Bozz.

01:00:06.575 --> 01:00:08.805
You apologize to me right now.

01:00:09.055 --> 01:00:11.649
Yeah, Bozz. Apologize to the man.

01:00:11.855 --> 01:00:15.609
Say, "I'm sorry I didn't
kill your ass!"

01:00:17.855 --> 01:00:19.288
Think that's funny?

01:00:20.735 --> 01:00:22.214
Fuck.

01:00:24.015 --> 01:00:27.246
You tried to embarrass me in front
of every fucking person here.

01:00:28.295 --> 01:00:29.808
Apologize.

01:00:41.575 --> 01:00:43.406
<i>Cease firing!</i>

01:00:43.735 --> 01:00:45.214
<i>Clear your weapons!</i>

01:00:48.335 --> 01:00:50.212
<i>Weapons clear.</i>

01:00:50.975 --> 01:00:53.409
<i>Next group on the line, let's move!</i>

01:01:00.455 --> 01:01:01.774
<i>Next group on the line!</i>

01:01:05.735 --> 01:01:07.327
- Weapon safe?
- Yeah, all clear.

01:01:07.535 --> 01:01:08.809
Take a mag.

01:01:11.615 --> 01:01:13.207
<i>Ready on the right.</i>

01:01:14.455 --> 01:01:16.013
<i>Ready on the left.</i>

01:01:16.255 --> 01:01:18.405
<i>Firing line is ready.</i>

01:01:18.615 --> 01:01:20.606
<i>Shooters, prepare to fire!</i>

01:01:21.015 --> 01:01:22.414
<i>Fire!</i>

01:01:34.975 --> 01:01:37.250
<i>Cease fire! Clear your weapons!</i>

01:01:37.455 --> 01:01:40.333
- Weapon clear, Barnes?
- All clear, Bozz.

01:01:44.015 --> 01:01:46.893
- The fuck you doing, Wilson?
- Killing me a Cong.

01:01:47.855 --> 01:01:49.925
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

01:01:50.135 --> 01:01:51.124
Unload that weapon!

01:01:51.335 --> 01:01:53.166
Head or the body, Bozz?
You choose!

01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:54.774
Unload that fucking weapon!

01:01:56.455 --> 01:01:59.333
- Head or the body?
- Damn it, unload that piece!

01:01:59.575 --> 01:02:02.248
- Fuck you, Bozz.
- Unload that weapon!

01:02:02.455 --> 01:02:03.365
Fuck you, Bozz!

01:02:25.215 --> 01:02:26.409
It's jammed.

01:02:27.015 --> 01:02:29.370
Did you see that? Did you see that?

01:02:40.655 --> 01:02:42.805
Looks like a misfeed jammed it.

01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:45.809
Well, you are one lucky dick, Bozz.

01:02:46.015 --> 01:02:48.768
It would've killed you
and the three people next to you.

01:02:48.975 --> 01:02:51.887
- Hope you're not too disappointed.
- What do you want to do?

01:02:52.095 --> 01:02:55.974
How about get Wilson as far
the fuck away as possible, sir?

01:02:57.655 --> 01:03:00.806
Well, you have the right to
press for a court-martial.

01:03:02.055 --> 01:03:04.364
Otherwise, you can let us
handle it our way.

01:03:04.575 --> 01:03:06.850
I'd personally prefer that option.

01:03:07.055 --> 01:03:10.445
- Consider it a personal favor to me.
- Get Wilson out, sir.

01:03:10.775 --> 01:03:13.573
I don't recall telling you
to open your stinkhole.

01:03:13.775 --> 01:03:17.006
He's right, sir. Wilson
shouldn't be in the Army.

01:03:17.215 --> 01:03:19.126
Even if he did try to kill somebody.

01:03:20.015 --> 01:03:22.404
You and I need to exchange some ideas.

01:03:22.655 --> 01:03:24.088
That doesn't solve our problem.

01:03:24.295 --> 01:03:27.810
We need to get him out now
or we'll file for a court-martial.

01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:29.249
Paxton, you're dismissed.

01:03:30.575 --> 01:03:31.803
Yes, sir.

01:03:41.975 --> 01:03:43.328
He's learning.

01:03:44.455 --> 01:03:48.209
Bozz, do you think the Army's never
seen pissants like you before?

01:03:49.255 --> 01:03:52.053
I know you think you're some
big swinging-dick hero.

01:03:52.255 --> 01:03:54.450
I know a lot of the men think so too.

01:03:54.655 --> 01:03:58.250
But I know you for what you are.
You are a coward.

01:03:58.455 --> 01:04:02.414
You're a born leader and you're afraid
to take any real responsibility!

01:04:02.655 --> 01:04:05.613
That's why you dropped out of school,
why you drop out of everything!

01:04:05.815 --> 01:04:07.328
You're pissing your life away!

01:04:07.535 --> 01:04:09.173
I don't need the fucking Army...

01:04:09.375 --> 01:04:11.843
...and I don't need the war
to tell me that, sir!

01:04:12.455 --> 01:04:13.683
Get on your feet, soldier.

01:04:14.655 --> 01:04:16.213
Attention!

01:04:17.935 --> 01:04:21.450
I don't want you in a stockade.
I don't want you recycled.

01:04:21.655 --> 01:04:24.806
I don't want you drummed out
on some bad conduct discharge.

01:04:26.055 --> 01:04:29.411
I want you exactly where you are.

01:04:30.055 --> 01:04:33.206
And we'll just naturally chew you up.

01:04:37.055 --> 01:04:40.491
I'll take care of Wilson.
You get the fuck out of my face.

01:05:08.495 --> 01:05:10.565
Sure glad they got Wilson's ass out.

01:05:10.815 --> 01:05:12.806
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

01:05:13.055 --> 01:05:15.649
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- You shut the fuck up.

01:05:15.895 --> 01:05:17.772
- Guys, relax.
- I ain't starting.

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:20.131
You already got your ass beat once.

01:05:20.335 --> 01:05:24.089
- Just watch your back in Tigerland.
- I'll do that.

01:05:25.295 --> 01:05:28.526
I guess I'm supposed to joke
about how I owe you my life.

01:05:28.735 --> 01:05:31.613
- He almost killed you.
- You jealous?

01:05:31.855 --> 01:05:33.925
You wanted to know what it was like.

01:05:34.135 --> 01:05:35.363
What what was like?

01:05:35.615 --> 01:05:38.175
The great lesson
of being close to death.

01:05:38.415 --> 01:05:39.768
Know what I know?

01:05:40.015 --> 01:05:41.926
Same thing you know.

01:05:42.295 --> 01:05:43.933
We're in a real bad way.

01:06:05.175 --> 01:06:06.733
Fuck.

01:06:08.415 --> 01:06:09.973
Real bad way.

01:06:10.215 --> 01:06:12.445
All right! Let's go! Move it!

01:06:12.695 --> 01:06:13.923
Come on! Let's go!

01:06:14.175 --> 01:06:16.405
- Come on! Move! Move!
- Move your ass!

01:06:16.655 --> 01:06:18.532
Come on, fat boy! Move your ass!

01:06:18.775 --> 01:06:20.527
Let's go, soldier!

01:06:25.975 --> 01:06:27.533
Let's go! Let's go!

01:06:31.775 --> 01:06:33.049
<i>Welcome to Tigerland!</i>

01:06:33.295 --> 01:06:36.173
<i>Your final training</i>
<i>before you're shipped overseas!</i>

01:06:36.415 --> 01:06:39.327
<i>Here, everything's done</i>
<i>exactly as it is over there.</i>

01:06:39.535 --> 01:06:42.003
<i>You will search and destroy,</i>
<i>hunt and kill!</i>

01:06:42.255 --> 01:06:45.406
<i>You'll move by chopper to secure</i>
<i>any area deemed necessary.</i>

01:06:45.655 --> 01:06:47.566
You'll be allowed one hour's sleep.

01:06:47.815 --> 01:06:50.329
Minor mistakes
will pay back major punishment.

01:06:50.535 --> 01:06:52.844
Maybe you've heard
we've lost this war.

01:06:53.095 --> 01:06:55.973
Or we've lost the support
of people here at home.

01:06:56.215 --> 01:06:58.171
It's too late to
ask those questions.

01:06:58.495 --> 01:07:00.213
You're not back on the block.

01:07:00.455 --> 01:07:02.969
You're alive in a year,
we'll talk about it.

01:07:03.215 --> 01:07:04.648
When you arrive in Nam...

01:07:04.895 --> 01:07:07.807
...it's important to get acclimated
as quickly as you can.

01:07:08.055 --> 01:07:10.011
Remember to think.

01:07:10.215 --> 01:07:12.251
- You understand me?
- Yes, sergeant!

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:17.330
What matters now is sharpening your
ability to find and destroy the enemy.

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:19.247
Practice how to stay alive.

01:07:19.495 --> 01:07:22.771
I know what you're thinking.
I've been there myself.

01:07:23.335 --> 01:07:25.769
<i>You're thinking you'll</i>
<i>go somewhere safe.</i>

01:07:26.015 --> 01:07:27.164
<i>You'll luck out.</i>

01:07:27.415 --> 01:07:30.532
<i>Tigerland is where</i>
<i>you stop bullshitting yourself.</i>

01:07:30.775 --> 01:07:34.450
Sarge, you got any advice
on how to stay alive in Vietnam?

01:07:34.695 --> 01:07:37.334
- I do, private. Don't go.
- Right on, right on.

01:07:37.575 --> 01:07:39.930
My friend here wants the experience.

01:07:40.175 --> 01:07:41.927
Says he ain't scared.

01:07:42.215 --> 01:07:43.933
Well, good luck.

01:07:44.135 --> 01:07:47.650
If you ask me, I'll stick
with the smart and the scared.

01:07:47.895 --> 01:07:52.650
You'll be under the care of NCOs
and officers who were in combat.

01:07:52.895 --> 01:07:54.408
Listen to them.

01:07:54.655 --> 01:07:57.727
They know what they're talking about.
Cota.

01:07:58.935 --> 01:08:00.653
I'm Staff Sergeant Cota.

01:08:00.895 --> 01:08:02.772
I've done two tours in Vietnam.

01:08:03.015 --> 01:08:05.529
My first in '67 with the 101 st.

01:08:05.975 --> 01:08:08.648
<i>I just completed my second with MAC-V.</i>

01:08:08.895 --> 01:08:11.568
<i>I only have two words</i>
<i>of advice for you.</i>

01:08:11.815 --> 01:08:13.487
<i>And those are to listen...</i>

01:08:13.855 --> 01:08:15.129
<i>... and to learn.</i>

01:08:16.215 --> 01:08:18.365
<i>All right, let's saddle up.</i>

01:08:19.215 --> 01:08:21.171
<i>Let's go! Let's saddle up!</i>

01:08:21.415 --> 01:08:22.928
<i>Let's go, goddamn it!</i>

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:28.327
Get down!

01:08:28.535 --> 01:08:30.924
Good job, Paxton. Good job.

01:08:31.175 --> 01:08:32.733
Good job, Johnson.

01:08:32.935 --> 01:08:33.924
All right.

01:08:34.175 --> 01:08:36.006
Get your ass behind that tree!

01:08:36.215 --> 01:08:39.924
Fantastic. You guys move
like fucking soldiers!

01:08:40.415 --> 01:08:42.326
Get your ass down!

01:08:43.375 --> 01:08:44.933
Ryan, get your ass down!

01:08:45.175 --> 01:08:47.245
Go! Move! Move!

01:08:47.495 --> 01:08:49.929
Bozz, keep that barrel
out of the dirt!

01:08:50.135 --> 01:08:51.328
Move, move, move!

01:08:51.535 --> 01:08:53.729
Paxton, why are you slowing up?

01:08:53.935 --> 01:08:55.334
Get your ass down!

01:08:56.015 --> 01:08:57.812
You are the weak link!

01:08:58.175 --> 01:09:00.450
This is not the time to slow up.

01:09:00.694 --> 01:09:02.447
Adapt! Overcome!

01:09:02.694 --> 01:09:04.287
Move! Get in there!

01:09:05.615 --> 01:09:06.604
You good?

01:09:06.854 --> 01:09:08.573
Why were you slow, Paxton?

01:09:08.814 --> 01:09:11.533
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine, sergeant.

01:09:22.295 --> 01:09:23.933
Diagonal, Private Barnes.

01:09:24.175 --> 01:09:27.008
- So you don't chop your knee off.
- Yes, sergeant.

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:35.133
Go ahead, Paxton.
I gotta take a piss.

01:09:36.175 --> 01:09:37.926
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:10:33.815 --> 01:10:36.727
"Jim Paxton
on personal guide to pain."

01:10:38.975 --> 01:10:42.809
Get that fucking torch out of my face
and put that cigarette out.

01:10:43.015 --> 01:10:46.007
You might as well
hang a big neon sign that says:

01:10:46.255 --> 01:10:48.325
"Dumb-fuck grunts, right here."

01:10:48.535 --> 01:10:51.333
You broke light discipline.
Therefore, you're dead.

01:10:51.575 --> 01:10:53.531
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.

01:10:53.735 --> 01:10:56.533
- Good.
- I'm still alive, sergeant.

01:10:56.895 --> 01:10:59.932
- What did you say?
- I said, I'm still alive.

01:11:00.415 --> 01:11:03.327
I miraculously survived the attack.

01:11:03.695 --> 01:11:05.526
- You didn't get hit?
- No.

01:11:05.735 --> 01:11:07.054
Are your friends alive?

01:11:07.295 --> 01:11:10.128
Yeah, Paxton's good.
Johnson, he's good and he's good.

01:11:10.455 --> 01:11:13.765
If you're gonna make up a story,
make up a happy one.

01:11:14.575 --> 01:11:16.725
I ain't making anything up, son.

01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:23.045
And in Vietnam there are no
happy fucking stories.

01:11:29.575 --> 01:11:32.373
I had a best buddy, Kelly Morgan...

01:11:32.615 --> 01:11:35.527
...that I went to AIT with.

01:11:37.415 --> 01:11:41.124
In '67, when the call came,
we got sent off to Nam.

01:11:41.695 --> 01:11:46.132
We had only been in country
a few days. We was green as grass.

01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:51.334
We were in a two-man listening post,
talking just like we are here.

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:54.125
Kelly lit up a cigarette.

01:11:54.975 --> 01:11:57.569
One minute we're naming
his unborn child...

01:11:57.815 --> 01:12:01.285
...and the next second
his brains were in my lap.

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:16.365
The sniper zeroed in
on the cherry of his cigarette, Bozz.

01:12:20.815 --> 01:12:24.330
Gentlemen, it's all about respect.

01:12:25.415 --> 01:12:28.930
Respect for your superiors
and what they're trying to teach you.

01:12:30.175 --> 01:12:33.326
Respect for yourselves and your unit.

01:12:34.975 --> 01:12:36.931
And most important...

01:12:38.375 --> 01:12:40.127
...respect the enemy.

01:12:45.575 --> 01:12:47.725
You have 42 minutes...

01:12:47.975 --> 01:12:50.535
...then the squad's on patrol.

01:13:03.535 --> 01:13:07.733
Gentlemen, this is the best Vietnamese
village we could create for you...

01:13:07.975 --> 01:13:09.169
...here on the base!

01:13:09.415 --> 01:13:13.249
Now, listen. You're all gooks,
so nobody speaks English.

01:13:13.495 --> 01:13:17.044
Anybody asks you a question
in English, you answer, "No bic."

01:13:17.295 --> 01:13:20.731
It means, "I don't speak" in gook-ese.
Let's hear it.

01:13:21.095 --> 01:13:24.565
Good. Private Bozz, you are
the only man that speaks English.

01:13:24.815 --> 01:13:29.650
Speak only to the man who identifies
himself as interpreter. Understood?

01:13:29.855 --> 01:13:31.573
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Private Paxton.

01:13:31.815 --> 01:13:33.248
You are the Vietcong.

01:13:33.495 --> 01:13:37.932
They come through, their objective
is to find the VC sympathizer.

01:13:38.135 --> 01:13:40.569
In other words, you, Private Paxton.

01:13:40.815 --> 01:13:42.726
They have five minutes.

01:13:42.935 --> 01:13:45.927
You tell them nothing.

01:13:46.415 --> 01:13:47.973
I warn you, they're beat up.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:50.046
They've been awake three nights.

01:13:50.295 --> 01:13:51.774
<i>Forced marched all day.</i>

01:13:52.015 --> 01:13:55.974
<i>They fuck this up,</i>
<i>they'll march another six miles.</i>

01:13:56.175 --> 01:13:57.369
<i>One other thing:</i>

01:13:57.615 --> 01:14:01.324
<i>They find out</i>
<i>which one of you is VC...</i>

01:14:01.575 --> 01:14:04.135
<i>... and you'll be the ones</i>
<i>out in the boonies...</i>

01:14:04.335 --> 01:14:07.611
<i>... on no sleep, forced marching</i>
<i>for the next two nights.</i>

01:14:07.815 --> 01:14:08.804
<i>Understood?</i>

01:14:09.055 --> 01:14:10.966
- Yes, sergeant.
- Let's get to work.

01:14:11.215 --> 01:14:13.775
Private Bozz, Paxton. Over here.

01:14:14.015 --> 01:14:17.371
Lets see...
Lukins, Barnes, in this hooch.

01:14:17.615 --> 01:14:19.731
Make it as realistic as possible.

01:14:19.935 --> 01:14:22.130
This is not a fucking joke.

01:14:22.415 --> 01:14:24.770
I like this.
It's like a war theme park.

01:14:25.015 --> 01:14:27.575
I'm so tired. I'm gonna pass out.

01:14:38.535 --> 01:14:40.127
Hey, here they come.

01:14:45.375 --> 01:14:46.728
Shit.

01:14:46.975 --> 01:14:48.169
It's Wilson.

01:14:49.295 --> 01:14:50.523
What?

01:14:50.735 --> 01:14:54.205
- I thought we got him out.
- There's a war going on.

01:14:54.415 --> 01:14:56.724
Plenty of room
for psychopathic killers.

01:14:56.935 --> 01:14:59.403
Let's move it.
We don't got much time.

01:14:59.655 --> 01:15:01.930
We gotta find the VC.

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:08.727
Fuck me.

01:15:10.615 --> 01:15:11.843
VC?

01:15:13.415 --> 01:15:15.531
Get your ass on the ground!

01:15:19.735 --> 01:15:21.532
Get on the fucking ground!

01:15:22.095 --> 01:15:23.528
You VC?

01:15:24.575 --> 01:15:25.928
You VC?

01:15:27.455 --> 01:15:28.524
How'd that feel?

01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:32.927
Need an interpreter?
I'm the only one that speaks English.

01:15:35.815 --> 01:15:37.487
How does that feel, Paxton?

01:15:43.695 --> 01:15:45.731
What are you gonna write about now?

01:15:50.095 --> 01:15:52.211
What are you writing in your journal?

01:15:58.055 --> 01:15:59.374
Don't fucking move!

01:16:01.215 --> 01:16:03.524
Let go of him, goddamn it!

01:16:10.015 --> 01:16:13.325
- You're in charge! On your feet!
- Yes, sergeant.

01:16:13.815 --> 01:16:16.045
Where is your weapon, soldier?

01:16:16.295 --> 01:16:17.523
There it is.

01:16:17.775 --> 01:16:20.926
Why didn't you secure the area,
Private Wilson?

01:16:21.415 --> 01:16:24.851
I'll tell you why.
Because you lost control!

01:16:25.095 --> 01:16:26.528
Yes, sergeant.

01:16:27.535 --> 01:16:29.765
Did you find any VC?

01:16:30.015 --> 01:16:33.724
No, you didn't.
That's the fucking answer.

01:16:34.095 --> 01:16:35.323
Come here.

01:16:37.255 --> 01:16:41.373
I promise you tears before breakfast.
Get your men and get out of here.

01:16:41.575 --> 01:16:43.725
Get out of here! Let's go. Move!

01:16:43.935 --> 01:16:46.051
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Is that right?

01:16:46.975 --> 01:16:49.170
- You gonna kill me again?
- I'll kill you.

01:16:49.495 --> 01:16:51.247
Get your hands off him!

01:16:52.695 --> 01:16:54.253
You want to go?

01:16:54.495 --> 01:16:56.963
Get the fuck out of here!

01:17:00.895 --> 01:17:03.125
- Get the fuck out!
- I'll break your neck!

01:17:03.495 --> 01:17:05.804
- Let's move!
- Get the fuck out of here!

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:07.647
Somebody grab my steel pot.

01:17:07.895 --> 01:17:09.533
Get out of here.

01:17:09.855 --> 01:17:11.766
- How you doing?
- Shit.

01:17:12.015 --> 01:17:13.368
Is he all right?

01:17:13.615 --> 01:17:14.934
No, he's not all right.

01:17:15.175 --> 01:17:17.325
Take your time.

01:18:20.255 --> 01:18:22.246
- You going?
- I can't take you with me.

01:18:22.495 --> 01:18:24.850
Not me. Paxton. He's hurting.

01:18:25.095 --> 01:18:26.130
He signed up.

01:18:26.375 --> 01:18:27.933
And you judged him for it.

01:18:28.135 --> 01:18:31.093
You even made me feel guilty
and I was drafted.

01:18:34.935 --> 01:18:37.529
You saw what Wilson did to him today.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:40.734
He's broken down.

01:18:40.935 --> 01:18:43.608
And the Army didn't do
all the breaking. Take him.

01:18:43.855 --> 01:18:46.813
It's not my fault if he
just realized what he did.

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:49.330
I only got time for my sad story.

01:18:49.575 --> 01:18:51.930
- Take him with you.
- Fuck off!

01:18:52.175 --> 01:18:54.735
Wilson's gonna take
his hate out on somebody.

01:18:54.975 --> 01:18:59.526
You run, he'll kill Paxton.
If not here, for sure over in Nam.

01:18:59.775 --> 01:19:01.811
Johnson, I like you, but fuck off.

01:19:02.935 --> 01:19:05.324
Yeah, well,
I ain't standing in your way.

01:19:58.695 --> 01:20:00.492
Rise and shine, gentlemen!

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:02.572
Let's go, gentlemen! Roll
em!

01:20:02.815 --> 01:20:05.534
Let's go! Move! Get on your feet!

01:20:05.735 --> 01:20:10.126
I know you're tired, but you'll be
doing a lot of this in the next year!

01:20:10.375 --> 01:20:11.728
If you're not...

01:20:11.935 --> 01:20:14.688
...then you're in a body bag.
- Where's Bozz?

01:20:14.895 --> 01:20:17.534
Waiting for a dust-off.

01:20:18.095 --> 01:20:20.529
Where is your squad leader?

01:20:20.935 --> 01:20:22.573
Is this his weapon?

01:20:22.815 --> 01:20:25.534
Does anybody know
where your squad leader is?

01:20:25.775 --> 01:20:27.128
Where is he, Johnson?

01:20:33.415 --> 01:20:36.691
- Where is your weapon, Private Bozz?
- Right here, sarge.

01:20:36.895 --> 01:20:38.089
I know that.

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:41.845
The next time you decide
to take a piss or a fucking shit...

01:20:42.095 --> 01:20:44.131
...you make sure you have your weapon.

01:20:44.335 --> 01:20:47.532
Your weapon is your lifeline.
Why didn't you have it?

01:20:47.735 --> 01:20:51.171
I was gonna make a break for Mexico.
I didn't think I'd need it.

01:20:51.415 --> 01:20:52.768
Very funny.

01:20:53.575 --> 01:20:55.167
You take point.

01:20:55.695 --> 01:20:59.529
Paxton, take slack. Johnson, drag.
The rest of you fall in behind.

01:20:59.735 --> 01:21:00.929
Listen up.

01:21:01.175 --> 01:21:04.531
You'll square off
against the boys from yesterday.

01:21:04.775 --> 01:21:06.413
They may have booby traps.

01:21:06.815 --> 01:21:09.045
They may have forward observers
watching.

01:21:09.295 --> 01:21:12.367
They may do all manner of shit
that you don't know.

01:21:12.615 --> 01:21:17.325
That's why you will keep
your eyes open and your mouths shut.

01:21:17.695 --> 01:21:20.732
- Is that fucking understood?
- Yes, sarge.

01:21:22.655 --> 01:21:23.770
Let's move out.

01:21:26.375 --> 01:21:29.924
- Welcome back.
- You owe me 150 bucks.

01:21:34.175 --> 01:21:36.530
Hurry up, Paxton. Let's go.

01:22:04.335 --> 01:22:06.565
Dixie, dixie, my 12.

01:22:06.815 --> 01:22:08.214
Dixie, my 12.

01:22:51.215 --> 01:22:53.524
Move it! Come on!

01:23:42.495 --> 01:23:43.814
You okay?

01:24:45.695 --> 01:24:49.768
Fuck, Bozz. Joke's over.
Can't you see we're fucked?

01:24:50.015 --> 01:24:52.404
Relax. You'll be fine.

01:24:52.655 --> 01:24:54.327
You'll be fine.

01:25:29.375 --> 01:25:32.731
Wilson, what the hell are you doing?
That's live ammo.

01:26:26.895 --> 01:26:28.726
Ambush! 12:00!

01:26:35.135 --> 01:26:36.329
Live ammo!

01:26:39.215 --> 01:26:41.683
Cease fire! Cease fire!

01:27:03.175 --> 01:27:04.369
Private Wilson!

01:27:04.895 --> 01:27:06.692
Private-fucking-Wilson!

01:27:06.975 --> 01:27:09.409
Private Wilson, look at me, goddamn it!

01:27:09.775 --> 01:27:11.731
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:27:13.815 --> 01:27:14.804
Look at me.

01:27:15.055 --> 01:27:17.205
You will place your weapon on safe!

01:27:17.615 --> 01:27:20.732
You will raise your weapon
above your fucking head...

01:27:20.975 --> 01:27:23.284
...or I'll blow
your fucking brains out!

01:27:24.935 --> 01:27:26.254
Oh, Jesus!

01:27:26.815 --> 01:27:28.134
Do it!

01:27:31.095 --> 01:27:32.847
On your fucking knees, now!

01:27:33.095 --> 01:27:34.608
Get on your fucking knees!

01:27:35.575 --> 01:27:39.090
You will be court-martialed!
Do you fucking hear me?

01:27:42.695 --> 01:27:44.765
- What happened?
- An accident. My fault.

01:27:46.215 --> 01:27:47.534
Let me look.

01:27:51.135 --> 01:27:52.534
Get him up.

01:28:04.895 --> 01:28:06.931
Let me see the eye.

01:29:10.815 --> 01:29:14.569
Let's go, move it!
This war is not gonna last forever!

01:29:14.815 --> 01:29:17.170
Bozz, bus number three!

01:29:17.415 --> 01:29:20.532
You don't want to miss this war!
Let's go!

01:29:23.975 --> 01:29:27.172
- Want to come along?
- I did, but you wouldn't let me.

01:29:28.215 --> 01:29:29.330
How's your eye?

01:29:30.935 --> 01:29:35.053
Got an injury bad enough to get out,
no permanent damage. Imagine that.

01:29:35.255 --> 01:29:37.007
More corny wisdom for your book.

01:29:37.255 --> 01:29:40.213
"In the country of the blind,
the one-eyed man is king."

01:29:40.815 --> 01:29:43.534
Pretty fancy shooting, Tex.
Thank you.

01:29:44.535 --> 01:29:47.652
It was just luck, Jim.
I could have killed you.

01:29:48.135 --> 01:29:49.727
No, it wasn't.

01:29:51.055 --> 01:29:53.091
Somebody had to take your place.

01:29:54.335 --> 01:29:56.849
Last chance.
Don't make me bring the war to you.

01:29:58.215 --> 01:29:59.887
Write me when you get there.

01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:02.367
This is it, man.

01:30:02.615 --> 01:30:04.606
No more phony Army buddy crap.

01:30:12.135 --> 01:30:13.727
Go home.

01:30:14.215 --> 01:30:16.126
Live a long time.

01:30:17.215 --> 01:30:19.331
Try not to be too much of an asshole.

01:30:20.975 --> 01:30:23.535
I'm gonna write
a whole book about this.

01:30:23.975 --> 01:30:25.567
Tell everyone about you.

01:30:29.375 --> 01:30:30.808
Sergeant Thomas...

01:30:31.055 --> 01:30:33.125
...sorry for my misbehavior earlier.

01:30:37.335 --> 01:30:38.529
Real sorry.

01:30:48.575 --> 01:30:50.452
See you back here. Take care.

01:30:50.655 --> 01:30:52.168
- Watch your back.
- See you.

01:30:52.415 --> 01:30:56.374
- I'll write a book about you, Bozz!
- No, you won't.

01:30:56.615 --> 01:30:59.129
Come on, quit playing.
That's my journal.

01:30:59.335 --> 01:31:01.769
Jesus! Bozz!

01:31:02.335 --> 01:31:04.929
Come on, quit fucking around.
That's my book!

01:31:06.175 --> 01:31:07.927
What are you doing? Shit!

01:31:08.175 --> 01:31:10.325
Stop the bus!

01:31:13.415 --> 01:31:15.167
What is this shit?

01:31:26.575 --> 01:31:28.531
<i>I never saw Bozz again.</i>

01:31:29.815 --> 01:31:32.204
<i>Some guys said he died in Nam...</i>

01:31:32.495 --> 01:31:34.326
<i>... but he was never listed.</i>

01:31:35.575 --> 01:31:38.135
<i>Some said he just</i>
<i>disappeared over there.</i>

01:31:38.495 --> 01:31:41.567
<i>One guy called and said</i>
<i>he thought he saw him in Mexico...</i>

01:31:41.815 --> 01:31:43.533
<i>... with a beautiful woman.</i>

01:31:44.895 --> 01:31:46.533
<i>But knowing Bozz...</i>

01:31:46.735 --> 01:31:49.932
<i>... he'd be pissed off</i>
<i>I was talking about him anyway.</i>
