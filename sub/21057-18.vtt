00:36.240 --> 00:41.750
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:45.250 --> 00:49.119
They were things that she wanted so badly.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.320
I wanted her to take all of them.

00:54.590 --> 00:56.130
The smell of burning leather...

00:56.759 --> 00:58.359
was really revolting.

00:59.759 --> 01:01.929
It smelled as disgusting...

01:02.000 --> 01:03.869
as rotting sludge of human desires.

01:06.069 --> 01:07.109
Then,

01:08.569 --> 01:12.280
I burned my last gift for her.

01:42.340 --> 01:43.340
This is the police, right?

01:44.239 --> 01:45.540
I'm calling to report a theft case.

01:45.780 --> 01:47.109
What should we do now?

01:48.349 --> 01:50.420
We're totally screwed now.

01:53.019 --> 01:55.950
This situation is really driving me crazy.

01:56.250 --> 01:59.459
Why on earth did you do such a thing without even talking to us about it?

01:59.790 --> 02:00.829
What are we going to do now?

02:02.159 --> 02:03.799
Dad's factory in China is not part of it.

02:03.930 --> 02:06.930
It's been sold too because it's also considered the company's asset.

02:06.930 --> 02:09.830
What about Dad's cash? He has cash.

02:09.870 --> 02:11.169
We can spend it.

02:11.169 --> 02:13.969
Hey, Jae Hui. How can you say that?

02:13.969 --> 02:15.710
What do you want me to do then?

02:15.909 --> 02:18.879
You should've stopped me when I said we should get Dad's company back.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.780
We're in this mess because you didn't stop me.

02:20.780 --> 02:23.419
Are you kidding me right now? You got us into this mess.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.219
I can't believe you want to spend Dad's cash.

02:25.349 --> 02:26.819
What is in that brain of yours?

02:26.919 --> 02:29.689
Gosh! Your wife divorced you because you cheated on her.

02:29.689 --> 02:31.289
Don't be mean.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.789
I'm being mean? You brought it upon yourself.

02:33.860 --> 02:36.060
- You got what you deserved. - What did you just say?

02:36.129 --> 02:39.030
- What! If you weren't my sister... - Fine, bring it on!

02:39.030 --> 02:41.530
- Go ahead and hit me. Just kill me. - Please don't be like this.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.330
You two should get through this together.

02:43.439 --> 02:46.340
You guys should just leave!

02:46.370 --> 02:47.469
We can't.

02:48.340 --> 02:50.080
We won't go anywhere until Jae Gu pays us.

02:51.180 --> 02:54.110
I'm going crazy! I'd rather die than live like this.

02:54.509 --> 02:58.379
Why should you die? Sue that con man and focus on getting the money back.

02:58.919 --> 03:02.490
- Hey, do you know any lawyers? - I do.

03:02.689 --> 03:03.990
He's a complete idiot though.

03:04.389 --> 03:07.590
Hey, you can't leave me here alone with those two guys.

03:09.430 --> 03:12.629
Gosh! This is so annoying!

03:16.030 --> 03:17.069
I...

03:17.139 --> 03:20.069
need you to make me just like you.

03:22.340 --> 03:23.379
I...

03:25.680 --> 03:27.710
want you to make me just like you.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.919
Woo A Jin, make me just like you.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.150
Then...

03:38.319 --> 03:39.319
I'll...

03:40.490 --> 03:42.030
help you save Chairman Ahn.

04:14.830 --> 04:16.360
You better not mess with me.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.829
If you mess with me one more time, I'll grind you up...

04:20.199 --> 04:22.970
and use you for salted seafood with kimchi.

04:24.939 --> 04:26.569
Did you send me hairtail heads?

04:27.639 --> 04:30.379
You must have lost your mind.

04:43.860 --> 04:45.220
Hello, Mr. Han. It's me.

04:46.490 --> 04:47.689
Let's meet.

05:40.050 --> 05:41.079
Ju Mi.

05:44.420 --> 05:45.449
Ju Mi.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.290
Ju Mi!

05:51.920 --> 05:54.930
All my jewelry has been stolen.

05:54.959 --> 05:56.459
You called the police already, right?

05:58.629 --> 06:00.300
I really don't want to live anymore.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.870
By the way, where's Un Gyu? It doesn't look like he's home.

06:03.970 --> 06:05.100
He's in the States.

06:05.370 --> 06:07.439
He's there with his friends to learn English...

06:07.439 --> 06:08.569
and celebrate his graduation.

06:08.639 --> 06:09.870
I'm glad he got to go away.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.639
He studied so hard for the college entrance exam.

06:16.079 --> 06:18.680
Is there any word from Jae Gu?

06:19.350 --> 06:20.350
I think...

06:23.620 --> 06:25.490
he's dead.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.589
What are you talking about?

06:30.259 --> 06:32.230
I can't even figure out when things started going wrong.

06:37.370 --> 06:39.439
I might go stay with my parents for a few days.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.839
I don't want to be alone.

06:42.970 --> 06:43.980
Yes, you should.

06:44.579 --> 06:45.980
The school is closed during vacation anyway.

06:46.509 --> 06:48.079
I hope you can get as much rest as possible.

06:58.490 --> 07:00.360
I told you that you don't need to come here anymore.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.259
Mr. Han would like me to stay and continue helping you.

07:04.129 --> 07:07.829
I bet he told you to continue to keep an eye on me.

07:15.370 --> 07:18.079
I didn't think she would do that. She even turned her phone off.

07:18.339 --> 07:19.740
People scare me the most.

07:20.009 --> 07:22.180
Do you happen to know Ms. Jo's new address?

07:22.350 --> 07:23.449
No, I don't.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.490
I do remember her talking about where her son works...

07:27.490 --> 07:29.620
when we were chatting at Pungsuk's Kitchen.

07:32.790 --> 07:34.790
- I love you. - Oh, boy.

07:35.189 --> 07:36.660
- I love you. - I love you.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.600
- I love you. - I love you.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.529
- I love you. - I love you.

07:49.910 --> 07:52.279
I'll visit Chairman Ahn at the hospital.

07:52.509 --> 07:54.980
- Okay, thank you. - No problem.

07:56.410 --> 07:59.079
Thank you so much for letting us meet at your place.

07:59.250 --> 08:00.689
How have you been, Ms. Baek?

08:00.920 --> 08:03.290
I moved north of the Han River.

08:04.490 --> 08:07.290
How about we have our next class at Ms. Baek's place?

08:07.290 --> 08:09.660
- It'll be a housewarming party. - Sounds good.

08:09.660 --> 08:11.259
All right, let's do that.

08:13.730 --> 08:15.129
"Let’s say that we had a good time."

08:16.629 --> 08:18.439
"The birds that have flown over the bamboo forest..."

08:19.000 --> 08:21.310
"and the refreshing sound of the wind that sparkles in our mind."

08:22.509 --> 08:25.110
"Like the fluffy splitting clouds in the sky,"

08:26.610 --> 08:29.779
"let’s say that we had a good time."

08:31.079 --> 08:33.690
"We were that beautiful,"

08:34.220 --> 08:37.490
"so sometime in the future, we shall meet again..."

08:38.759 --> 08:39.919
"as little violet flowers."

08:41.860 --> 08:44.129
I recited "Traveling Violet" by...

08:44.129 --> 08:46.100
poet Kang Tae Rim for all of you...

08:46.460 --> 08:48.700
because of today's topic.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.299
It's death.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.110
We all die one day.

08:54.509 --> 08:58.110
In a way, knowing that we will die might make us...

08:58.779 --> 09:00.350
that much more eager for life.

09:01.110 --> 09:05.320
Today, I'd like all of us to face the idea of death.

09:06.149 --> 09:10.059
Let's think about how we'd feel if we were to die tomorrow.

09:12.259 --> 09:13.990
After choosing death as today's topic,

09:14.090 --> 09:16.629
I texted all of you asking to bring your will.

09:17.399 --> 09:18.860
You all brought it, right?

09:18.960 --> 09:19.960
Yes.

09:20.970 --> 09:23.669
- I love you. - I love you.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.070
(Ownership Transferred Owner, Park Ji Yeong)

09:30.080 --> 09:32.210
It includes the subrogation certificate, right?

09:32.409 --> 09:33.980
It's with that certificate.

09:34.210 --> 09:36.580
It looks like you want the house under your name now.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.480
I'll leave it at this for now,

09:39.779 --> 09:41.919
but you'll have to see me in court.

09:42.419 --> 09:43.419
Pardon me?

09:44.789 --> 09:47.230
Aren't you colluding with Mr. Han Min Gi?

09:48.190 --> 09:49.360
What are you talking about?

09:49.360 --> 09:52.059
I thought about suing right away,

09:53.159 --> 09:54.899
but I figured that it'd be better to pay it off...

09:54.970 --> 09:58.070
and then file a claim for all damages that have been done.

09:58.299 --> 10:00.669
I'll also press charges for fraud and embezzlement.

10:05.110 --> 10:07.850
Then, I'll see you in court.

10:17.389 --> 10:19.620
It's me, Mr. Han.

10:24.259 --> 10:27.429
- Hello? - This is Gangnam Police Station.

10:40.009 --> 10:41.110
Excuse me.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.879
I'm here because I got a call from Detective Lee Chun Gi.

10:44.919 --> 10:46.549
- Are you Ms. Park Ji Yeong? - Yes.

10:46.850 --> 10:49.120
Two cases have been reported to us.

10:49.490 --> 10:52.120
The first one is Ahn Jae Gu going missing,

10:52.190 --> 10:54.889
and the other one is Cheon Bang Soon's theft case.

10:55.490 --> 10:58.330
You're connected to both cases.

10:59.129 --> 11:01.600
I know about Jae Gu going missing,

11:01.600 --> 11:04.940
but what do you mean by Cheon Bang Soon's theft case?

11:04.940 --> 11:06.570
On February 13,

11:07.070 --> 11:09.110
she stole Ms. Park Ju Mi's 300,000 dolllars worth of jewelry...

11:09.139 --> 11:10.909
from Mr. Ahn Tae Dong's residence and ran away.

11:12.139 --> 11:15.179
We heard that you hired her.

11:15.450 --> 11:16.919
- That's right. - Where is she now?

11:17.019 --> 11:18.049
Who?

11:19.220 --> 11:20.250
Cheon Bang Soon?

11:20.789 --> 11:23.019
Or were you asking about Jae Gu?

11:25.019 --> 11:26.559
As for Jae Gu...

11:27.259 --> 11:29.929
He broke into my hotel room with a knife.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.399
You should be able to see it in the security camera footage.

11:33.529 --> 11:35.299
We already checked the footage.

11:35.299 --> 11:37.470
Then, you must know who took him.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.940
It was my bodyguard.

11:40.769 --> 11:44.779
But I'm afraid, I have no idea...

11:44.779 --> 11:46.009
what he did to him.

11:46.639 --> 11:49.610
Do you have any idea what your bodyguard did?

11:49.610 --> 11:50.649
That's right.

11:50.649 --> 11:53.350
Are you saying that he did whatever he did...

11:53.850 --> 11:55.120
at his sole discretion?

11:55.590 --> 11:56.620
That's correct.

11:57.460 --> 11:58.490
I found him...

11:58.490 --> 12:01.360
through the CEO of MK Capital,

12:01.360 --> 12:02.730
Mr. Han Min Gi.

12:03.399 --> 12:06.769
He probably did what Mr. Han...

12:06.769 --> 12:08.169
told him to do.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.509
And as for Cheon Bang Soon,

12:18.809 --> 12:20.080
I have no idea where she is now,

12:20.279 --> 12:23.210
but I can give you her address in our hometown.

12:23.649 --> 12:27.320
She's probably not there though.

12:32.019 --> 12:35.889
By the way, did anyone file charges against me for something else?

12:36.330 --> 12:37.399
Like what?

12:37.460 --> 12:40.370
I ran away with the money from selling...

12:40.629 --> 12:41.870
Chairman Ahn's company.

12:41.870 --> 12:46.000
That's why his eldest son came to the hotel to kill me.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.720
Gosh, it's a total disaster right now.

13:03.659 --> 13:05.960
The family is in such a mess at the moment.

13:06.730 --> 13:10.360
There are so many things that I have to sort out,

13:10.360 --> 13:14.000
but you're keeping me here. I don't have time to waste!

13:14.429 --> 13:15.470
All right.

13:15.870 --> 13:17.970
Then, we should get started right away.

13:18.570 --> 13:19.570
Name.

13:20.110 --> 13:21.669
That was the first...

13:21.740 --> 13:23.639
and last time I saw Ms. Park.

13:29.080 --> 13:32.679
This case is so perplexing and complicated that it's...

13:34.389 --> 13:35.419
By the way,

13:37.220 --> 13:40.230
how did the two of you become close?

13:42.129 --> 13:44.830
"I'm departing this life like this,"

13:45.259 --> 13:47.070
"but I want to leave with a big smile on my face."

13:48.129 --> 13:50.169
"Since the day I first met you,"

13:50.200 --> 13:53.299
"every day of my life has been filled with so much joy."

13:53.509 --> 13:57.409
"I've never met anyone with such a positive mind..."

13:58.509 --> 14:02.649
"and I've also never seen anybody with such a beautiful smile."

14:03.549 --> 14:05.980
"Hence, not being able to see you anymore,"

14:06.580 --> 14:09.450
"is the only reason why dying tomorrow..."

14:09.450 --> 14:10.860
"is painful to me."

14:12.289 --> 14:15.330
"Let's meet a bit sooner in our next life..."

14:16.190 --> 14:18.029
"so that we can love each other more..."

14:18.759 --> 14:20.669
"and be happier."

14:24.500 --> 14:27.970
What was that? It was more like a love letter than a will.

14:28.370 --> 14:30.740
No, it is my will.

14:30.980 --> 14:32.309
I want to give this...

14:33.009 --> 14:35.149
to my dear wife...

14:35.580 --> 14:38.480
- when I die. - My goodness.

14:38.549 --> 14:40.149
Mr. Kang, you're so romantic.

14:40.149 --> 14:43.250
Gosh, I only wrote complaints about my wife.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.090
You're making me look bad.

14:48.330 --> 14:49.690
- Goodness. - Good job.

14:50.529 --> 14:51.529
Why...

14:52.659 --> 14:53.899
was my love...

14:55.600 --> 14:57.799
so meaningless?

14:59.370 --> 15:01.809
Ms. Woo, it's your turn now.

15:07.379 --> 15:09.450
"These days, I'm going through..."

15:10.649 --> 15:13.220
"the most intense and difficult time of my life."

15:13.990 --> 15:16.759
"But it's helping me grow as a person at the same time."

15:18.059 --> 15:21.889
"I'm grateful to have the chance to think about life and death..."

15:21.889 --> 15:23.700
"at this point in time..."

15:24.330 --> 15:28.000
"because I think I really needed it."

15:30.669 --> 15:32.370
"As of tomorrow,"

15:32.539 --> 15:34.940
"I will no longer be part of this world."

15:59.429 --> 16:01.370
"My bones and flesh will be gone."

16:02.000 --> 16:05.440
"Starting tomorrow, I'll exist as a mere skeleton."

16:06.269 --> 16:07.840
I'm sorry that I'm late.

16:09.610 --> 16:12.379
"We worried about possible misfortunes when we were happy,"

16:13.649 --> 16:15.710
"and we hoped for happiness when such misfortunes befell us."

16:16.279 --> 16:19.179
"Most importantly, we lived with ceaseless desires..."

16:19.250 --> 16:21.549
"for things that we couldn't have."

16:23.990 --> 16:25.889
"While looking down on others,"

16:25.889 --> 16:28.529
"we still had to worry about what they may think of us."

16:29.090 --> 16:31.259
"We constantly compared ourselves to others thinking..."

16:31.629 --> 16:34.100
"it may help us decide how happy or unhappy we can say we are."

16:40.370 --> 16:43.940
"Nonetheless, being alive is bliss in and of itself."

16:43.940 --> 16:46.080
"I'm realizing it now that I'm faced with death."

16:47.779 --> 16:50.679
"I was grateful for life itself."

16:51.279 --> 16:54.289
"What made me happy was neither fancy clothes..."

16:54.350 --> 16:56.419
"nor expensive bags."

16:57.320 --> 17:00.429
"I thank and love the life I've lived..."

17:01.330 --> 17:04.630
"and the people I've met..."

17:05.160 --> 17:07.069
"over the course of my life."

17:24.549 --> 17:25.579
Who is it?

17:29.319 --> 17:30.359
Who...

17:32.960 --> 17:34.089
Hello, Ms. Kim.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.029
What are you doing here?

17:39.359 --> 17:42.970
I came to say goodbye. This is my last month here.

17:43.970 --> 17:45.000
Come in.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.420
Did you find a new job?

18:00.450 --> 18:02.950
Yes, it's a sales position at a credit card company.

18:02.990 --> 18:05.289
You got a promotion and a raise.

18:06.019 --> 18:07.160
Why are you quitting?

18:07.289 --> 18:09.089
Mr. Seo has dirt on me,

18:09.730 --> 18:11.799
so I've had to do things that I didn't want to do.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.269
Things that you don't want to do?

18:15.170 --> 18:16.970
I've tailed someone and...

18:19.200 --> 18:21.569
Anyway, I can't expect to be...

18:22.009 --> 18:23.640
treated respectfully if I stay here.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.880
That's why I've decided to quit.

18:29.049 --> 18:30.579
I think I'm partially responsible...

18:33.079 --> 18:34.519
for you being treated like that.

18:35.819 --> 18:37.359
- I'm sorry. - No.

18:37.690 --> 18:39.460
I'm the one who started off on the wrong foot.

18:39.720 --> 18:40.890
I want to apologize.

18:41.359 --> 18:42.730
And thank you.

18:44.529 --> 18:46.529
Ms. Kim, I hope you stay healthy.

18:48.029 --> 18:49.069
Mr. Kim.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.440
Do you need money?

18:53.640 --> 18:55.940
No, not at all. That's not what this was about.

18:57.309 --> 18:59.279
I broke up with that guy.

19:01.210 --> 19:02.210
Do you...

19:03.180 --> 19:04.779
want to be my boyfriend?

19:09.690 --> 19:11.990
You can say no by all means.

19:13.190 --> 19:15.259
I'll be fine since I have no feelings for you.

19:15.730 --> 19:18.730
I won't be hurt.

19:21.269 --> 19:22.299
Well...

19:22.670 --> 19:24.369
Can I think about it?

19:26.269 --> 19:27.740
Sure, think about it.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.279
You should go.

19:31.079 --> 19:32.109
Goodbye.

19:47.430 --> 19:48.630
Just eat first.

19:49.059 --> 19:51.700
After this, we can meet with the lawyer and the police.

19:51.730 --> 19:53.299
Let's meet that prick, Mr. Han too.

19:55.029 --> 19:56.500
By the way, about Jae Gu.

19:57.170 --> 19:58.339
Where do you think he is?

19:59.069 --> 20:01.269
He has never fallen off the face of the earth like this.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.210
I know. What is happening?

20:05.279 --> 20:07.009
What if he got abducted?

20:08.309 --> 20:09.710
Do you guys have any idea?

20:09.950 --> 20:12.849
Of course, we do. It's probably Park Bok Ja's doing.

20:13.119 --> 20:14.819
Try to use your brain a little.

20:14.849 --> 20:18.589
Gosh, what's wrong with you? Know your place, will you?

20:18.759 --> 20:20.059
How dare you lecture me?

20:20.089 --> 20:22.589
What should we tell the police first?

20:24.200 --> 20:27.569
Hey, why did you cook the noodles for so long? They're all sodden.

20:27.630 --> 20:31.269
Exactly. Is this supposed to be udon or what?

20:31.970 --> 20:35.039
- Don't eat it then. - I didn't say I won't eat it.

20:36.779 --> 20:39.980
- This situation is driving me nuts! - Gosh, seriously.

21:05.339 --> 21:06.710
- See you in the next class. - Take care.

21:06.710 --> 21:08.339
- Bye. - See you soon.

21:09.710 --> 21:12.539
Call me if they start meeting up regularly again for brunch.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.109
Of course, I definitely will.

21:18.450 --> 21:19.619
Mr. Kang, aren't you leaving?

21:20.490 --> 21:23.819
I have to speak with Ms. Woo about her lawsuit.

21:24.089 --> 21:25.190
I'll leave in a bit.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.259
I still have some legal matters to deal with.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.059
All right. I'll get going then.

21:35.430 --> 21:37.970
You didn't eat snacks earlier. Shall I fix you a meal?

21:38.700 --> 21:39.869
Thank you very much.

21:41.170 --> 21:42.269
Excuse me for a moment.

21:48.779 --> 21:49.980
She totally startled me.

21:51.650 --> 21:53.220
She must have been holding it.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.960
Everything looks delicious.

22:00.230 --> 22:02.960
Come join us. You must be hungry.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.000
Let's eat together.

22:05.829 --> 22:06.829
No, thanks.

22:08.529 --> 22:10.599
This kimchi is so good.

22:18.579 --> 22:19.779
Just come sit here.

22:26.450 --> 22:28.289
Eat up, Ms. Yun Seong Hui.

22:33.190 --> 22:34.930
There's something I've been wanting to ask you.

22:35.630 --> 22:36.700
What is it?

22:37.759 --> 22:40.299
Did you really love Jae Seok?

22:41.829 --> 22:42.970
I'd rather not answer that.

22:45.769 --> 22:48.609
I see. That's clever. That's a good answer.

22:51.640 --> 22:54.380
I'm moving out. I've decided to give up.

22:54.950 --> 22:55.950
Seriously?

22:56.279 --> 22:57.549
You should sue and take it to court.

22:57.579 --> 22:59.119
That way, I can make money.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.859
- What's wrong? - This is so delicious.

23:19.839 --> 23:22.670
This is unlike any other rice punch. It tastes divine.

23:22.740 --> 23:25.740
I'll pack some for you so that you can drink it at home.

23:26.849 --> 23:28.779
What are you planning to do with that woman?

23:29.509 --> 23:32.150
I must take all the money she has.

23:33.119 --> 23:35.049
Everything including the company and her money.

23:35.990 --> 23:38.690
I cannot let a woman like her enter the upper class...

23:38.690 --> 23:40.289
without shedding a drop of blood.

23:40.390 --> 23:43.059
There's nothing I haven't done to get to where I am now.

23:43.829 --> 23:48.130
Listen, I came this far on my own through my own efforts.

23:50.299 --> 23:52.670
I couldn't stand her the moment I first saw her.

23:54.970 --> 23:56.569
Who does she think she is?

23:58.579 --> 24:00.880
That woman dared to humiliate me.

24:02.180 --> 24:03.420
Not once, but several times.

25:05.410 --> 25:08.450
- Hello? - I'm want a style consultant.

25:09.579 --> 25:12.750
Just like how you were on the lookout for a caregiver,

25:13.180 --> 25:14.220
I'm looking for...

25:15.019 --> 25:17.420
a consultant who can refine my style so that I can really...

25:18.559 --> 25:19.759
become a woman of the upper class.

25:20.130 --> 25:22.259
All right, I'll do it for you.

25:23.190 --> 25:25.559
You must have a specific taste though.

25:26.869 --> 25:29.400
I mean, you can't just hire anybody, right?

25:32.440 --> 25:33.940
I'd like it to be someone...

25:35.210 --> 25:38.480
who likes Matisse and Kandinsky.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.150
Come now.

25:41.650 --> 25:44.650
To the place where we met for the very first time.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.549
That place probably doesn't exist...

25:50.559 --> 25:52.720
in your memory.

25:53.690 --> 25:55.529
Just come to the place you remember...

25:56.190 --> 25:58.329
meeting me for the first time.

25:59.130 --> 26:00.269
I'll see you there.

26:41.910 --> 26:44.440
The Daesung Pulp family has basically lost everything.

26:44.539 --> 26:47.779
Ms. Jo and the woman whom Park Bok Ja hired...

26:47.849 --> 26:51.750
ran away with all the jewelry that was in the house.

26:52.650 --> 26:55.049
I heard that Park Bok Ja came back though.

26:55.089 --> 26:58.690
My goodness. By the way, where did Ms. Jo go?

26:58.819 --> 27:01.059
Her daughter is hospitalized now.

27:01.190 --> 27:03.799
- That's probably where she is. - That's right.

27:04.259 --> 27:06.359
She said her daughter has to get kidney dialysis.

27:06.730 --> 27:07.829
Which hospital was it?

27:08.099 --> 27:09.529
It's not in Seoul.

27:09.529 --> 27:11.099
(Orderer: Park Bok Ja Product: Blowfish Porridge 1kg)

27:11.940 --> 27:14.940
Keep your voice down. Pung Suk might hear us.

27:29.150 --> 27:31.160
Do you really like Matisse?

27:31.289 --> 27:33.019
I'm pretty sure I told you that day.

27:34.059 --> 27:38.059
I like Manet more than Matisse.

27:39.799 --> 27:40.799
Right, you said that.

27:42.130 --> 27:44.000
Are you happier now that you're divorced?

27:45.740 --> 27:48.009
Are you happier now that you have money?

27:56.250 --> 27:57.619
Have you hired a lawyer yet?

27:57.950 --> 28:00.289
I told you that the family will sue you to get the shares back.

28:00.490 --> 28:02.549
Bring it on.

28:03.490 --> 28:05.490
I'm no longer part of the family.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.289
Jae Seok and his siblings will have to do it,

28:08.630 --> 28:11.299
but Jae Gu has gone missing.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.700
Yes, I know that.

28:14.900 --> 28:17.170
I bet you also know where he is, right?

28:17.170 --> 28:20.339
You won't believe me, but I don't know about that.

28:20.970 --> 28:24.609
The police must be doing their best to find him at the moment.

28:25.309 --> 28:27.150
I told them who might be a prime suspect.

28:32.549 --> 28:33.849
Let's take your measurements first.

28:34.049 --> 28:35.089
All right.

28:41.759 --> 28:43.160
What's your shoe size?

28:43.599 --> 28:44.960
I wear 245mm.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.240
You said that you want to be like me, right?

28:53.470 --> 28:54.509
Yes, I did.

28:54.509 --> 28:55.539
Then,

28:56.170 --> 28:57.809
will you be able to do as I say?

29:03.720 --> 29:04.779
Of course.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.150
All right, then.

29:10.019 --> 29:12.220
Help Father wake up.

29:13.789 --> 29:15.660
We have to keep the promises we made.

29:16.960 --> 29:20.400
My plan was to win her over to my side through it.

29:20.400 --> 29:21.869
Can we start today?

29:24.339 --> 29:26.670
Sure. Let's start today.

29:32.940 --> 29:35.049
(Healing Hands)

29:39.619 --> 29:41.650
Being treated like a queen...

29:43.359 --> 29:46.890
while looking over the entire Gangnam area from here...

29:48.529 --> 29:49.859
is quite nice.

29:50.500 --> 29:53.329
Like everything else, it's nicer when you behold it...

29:55.400 --> 29:57.369
from afar and from the outside.

30:00.109 --> 30:03.140
My goal was to turn everything back to square one.

30:03.839 --> 30:05.640
That was the last thing I had to do...

30:06.240 --> 30:09.210
as I was leaving that family.

30:10.920 --> 30:13.349
After all, I was the one who let Park Bok Ja...

30:14.619 --> 30:16.250
set foot in that house in the first place.

30:17.759 --> 30:20.359
Father, it's me.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.529
She's at home now.

30:30.599 --> 30:33.670
Do you think she's back for good?

30:36.170 --> 30:37.579
I'll make her stay.

30:39.839 --> 30:42.309
She'll probably leave me...

30:44.349 --> 30:46.279
if I wake up, right?

30:51.660 --> 30:54.829
Do you want to get your money back?

30:57.059 --> 30:58.099
Or...

30:59.259 --> 31:02.130
is it her heart that you want back?

31:43.269 --> 31:47.109
(Will)

31:53.019 --> 31:54.119
I want a divorce.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.589
Do you want to go to trial or what?

32:02.589 --> 32:05.130
Who's the guy? Who is the father of that baby?

32:05.200 --> 32:06.430
Why do you care?

32:06.769 --> 32:08.130
What matters is that...

32:08.430 --> 32:09.599
it's not yours.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.039
Get out of my house immediately.

32:13.170 --> 32:14.170
I want alimony.

32:14.910 --> 32:17.410
Give me my share of the assets. Then, I'll leave.

32:18.940 --> 32:20.009
Have you gone insane?

32:20.710 --> 32:22.549
You don't deserve alimony.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.349
I should get alimony from you.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.579
You cheated on me and even got pregnant with that guy.

32:26.579 --> 32:27.619
Let's...

32:28.420 --> 32:29.619
go to trial then.

32:30.190 --> 32:33.059
Between me, who cheated on you and is carrying a baby from an affair...

32:33.460 --> 32:36.190
and you, who hit me 47 times in total up to this point,

32:36.230 --> 32:39.630
each time with a two week recovery, who is more at fault?

32:40.430 --> 32:42.029
Let's ask the judge.

32:42.430 --> 32:44.099
- You... - Last but not least,

32:44.170 --> 32:45.940
we should ask Yun Jae too.

32:46.369 --> 32:48.509
He should choose with whom he wants to live...

32:48.769 --> 32:50.309
between his two parents.

(Law Office of Kang Gi Ho Kang Gi Ho, Attorney at Law)

33:20.640 --> 33:22.769
Hey, what are you doing here?

33:25.579 --> 33:27.210
From what I remember,

33:27.210 --> 33:29.509
I've made it clear to you that I don't want to represent you.

33:29.509 --> 33:32.549
I'm not interested in hiring a lawyer like you.

33:32.549 --> 33:33.890
Why are you here then?

33:35.990 --> 33:37.859
To study the recent trends in the legal industry.

33:42.589 --> 33:43.630
Gosh, that little...

33:43.630 --> 33:44.859
I can knock him out with a single punch.

33:53.769 --> 33:56.680
You must be well aware of the situation your family is in.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.950
- What? - You won't sue her for the shares?

34:00.950 --> 34:02.049
Why do you care?

34:02.079 --> 34:04.220
The situation is very serious,

34:04.220 --> 34:06.549
yet your ex- wife is looking after your father at the hospital...

34:07.089 --> 34:09.789
and you're even making her worry about your family's legal matters.

34:09.789 --> 34:12.719
What you're saying is bothering me on so many levels.

34:13.090 --> 34:15.630
First off, why do you know so much about my family's situation?

34:15.630 --> 34:16.929
That's exactly my point.

34:17.130 --> 34:18.900
Why are you making me know so much?

34:19.099 --> 34:21.130
You should figure it out so that I don't need to know.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.300
Also,

34:22.630 --> 34:23.768
are you worrying...

34:24.039 --> 34:25.340
about my wife right now?

34:26.739 --> 34:27.768
Hey, look.

34:28.239 --> 34:29.969
If you call her your wife once again,

34:30.239 --> 34:31.610
I'll teach you a serious lesson.

34:32.579 --> 34:34.510
- She is my wife. - You two are divorced now.

34:34.510 --> 34:37.780
- I'm going to file an appeal. - Sure, go ahead. By all means.

34:38.320 --> 34:41.849
But make sure Ms. Woo won't have to worry about your family anymore.

34:41.849 --> 34:44.559
She looks exhausted these days because she's been working so much.

34:48.590 --> 34:51.230
Why are you worried about my spouse looking exhausted?

34:51.230 --> 34:52.699
I told you she's not your wife anymore.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.929
That's why I'm calling her my "spouse."

34:57.440 --> 34:58.539
Are you an idiot?

34:59.340 --> 35:00.940
You little...

35:02.570 --> 35:05.280
Why is this so heavy? Gosh.

35:05.380 --> 35:06.980
Come out. Just leave.

35:13.920 --> 35:14.989
Goodness.

35:17.719 --> 35:19.920
Why did you put the trash can here?

35:23.500 --> 35:25.099
You'd never think he's not all there.

35:31.340 --> 35:33.440
I can't believe you're giving all of those away.

35:33.909 --> 35:35.570
My most valuable asset is myself.

35:35.639 --> 35:37.380
I won't rely on clothes anymore.

36:01.800 --> 36:04.800
She's my client. It wasn't easy for her to come here. Say hello.

36:10.039 --> 36:11.079
Hello.

36:12.110 --> 36:14.280
I'm almost done. Please give me a few minutes.

36:14.449 --> 36:15.480
Okay.

36:49.550 --> 36:50.579
Oh god.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.489
Hey, you know what?

37:00.730 --> 37:03.860
I just thought that monogamy where infidelity is...

37:03.860 --> 37:05.130
legally allowed...

37:05.130 --> 37:06.230
No, I mean...

37:06.699 --> 37:08.630
The society that allows love.

37:08.699 --> 37:12.239
I just dreamed of that idea, Mr. Park.

37:12.300 --> 37:14.969
You don't have time to be sitting here like this, Mr. Ahn.

37:15.570 --> 37:17.139
What should I be doing then?

37:17.210 --> 37:19.579
The police are at the office at the moment.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.610
- Why? - They arrived...

37:22.710 --> 37:23.780
when you called me.

37:24.880 --> 37:25.920
Why are they there?

37:26.079 --> 37:27.889
You should go there now and find out.

37:30.260 --> 37:31.590
Hurry up. Get in.

37:31.860 --> 37:32.889
Get in.

37:35.289 --> 37:36.289
Jae Hui.

37:38.099 --> 37:41.000
Stop right there! Gosh. Jae Hui!

37:43.400 --> 37:46.599
Are you saying Jae Hui brought those two guys...

37:46.869 --> 37:48.340
and beat up Mr. Han?

37:48.610 --> 37:49.769
Yes, that's right.

37:50.309 --> 37:51.510
Why on earth did she...

37:51.780 --> 37:54.210
By the way, that man, Mr. Han...

37:54.579 --> 37:55.780
What happened to him?

37:56.920 --> 37:57.949
Sorry?

37:58.150 --> 38:00.789
You don't know anything.

38:01.619 --> 38:04.289
Gosh, this totally sobered me up.

38:05.989 --> 38:09.230
Everyone in that family is an idiot. All of them are too impulsive.

38:09.889 --> 38:11.300
So, what happened to Jae Gu Ahn?

38:12.599 --> 38:14.030
I did what you told me to do.

38:14.030 --> 38:16.599
Well, I guess they'll sort it out amongst themselves now.

38:16.630 --> 38:17.769
It's none of my business.

38:18.699 --> 38:21.309
By the way, did he believe all of that?

38:22.010 --> 38:23.809
Yes, he did.

38:23.809 --> 38:26.409
I told you. All of them are brainless.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.250
(Vip Room)

38:33.019 --> 38:36.119
I'd like to thank your housekeeper for looking after Chairman Ahn.

38:36.289 --> 38:39.019
Please stay by his side even for just a few hours at night.

38:39.460 --> 38:40.530
Okay, I will.

38:41.659 --> 38:43.059
I'll see you tomorrow at the gallery.

38:43.829 --> 38:44.860
All right.

38:46.500 --> 38:47.530
Wait.

38:51.599 --> 38:55.510
The last outfit you wore today, the two-piece suit.

38:56.880 --> 38:58.409
Please make me...

38:59.139 --> 39:00.409
the exact same one.

39:03.380 --> 39:04.420
Sure.

39:07.389 --> 39:08.519
You should get going now.

39:09.119 --> 39:10.619
Don't worry about Chairman Ahn.

39:11.289 --> 39:12.489
Ms. Park.

39:16.059 --> 39:18.460
You're not a bad person.

39:19.730 --> 39:21.599
I've known that from the get-go.

39:22.829 --> 39:24.000
That's why...

39:25.099 --> 39:27.539
you can never become happy by committing bad deeds.

39:57.940 --> 39:59.400
I'm here now.

40:04.980 --> 40:06.579
So, please wake up soon.

40:33.099 --> 40:34.739
I'm so impressed by A Jin.

40:34.809 --> 40:36.440
She's giving these away without any hesitation.

40:38.340 --> 40:40.679
It's getting late. You should leave for the day, Jin Hui.

40:40.679 --> 40:41.809
No, it's okay.

40:42.579 --> 40:44.219
Let's finish it up tomorrow.

40:45.219 --> 40:47.920
We just have a few more to upload. Can I finish it before I leave?

40:48.820 --> 40:52.820
My goodness. A Jin is blessed to have such good people around her.

40:53.119 --> 40:55.159
Where did she even find a sworn sister like you?

40:55.590 --> 40:57.460
Let's grab a snack together after we finish this.

40:57.760 --> 40:58.929
Shall we?

40:59.730 --> 41:00.900
Count me in too.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.469
A Jin said she's coming back. The four of us should grab a drink.

41:04.469 --> 41:07.269
Detective, that guy is a con man.

41:07.340 --> 41:09.210
We didn't do anything wrong.

41:09.710 --> 41:12.610
Will you keep your mouth shut like a total loser if you get conned?

41:12.679 --> 41:13.710
Listen.

41:14.079 --> 41:15.780
You barged into his office,

41:15.809 --> 41:17.449
threatened him and beat him up!

41:17.449 --> 41:18.719
Of course, I had to do it.

41:19.150 --> 41:21.920
I told you that my family lost everything because of that jerk.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.659
So, what? Is that why you paid these guys here...

41:24.659 --> 41:26.619
and solicited them to assault him?

41:26.760 --> 41:28.230
What on earth are you talking about?

41:28.760 --> 41:30.159
I won't pay these guys.

41:30.929 --> 41:32.500
You promised us that you'll pay us.

41:32.500 --> 41:33.969
As you know, the plan failed.

41:34.070 --> 41:37.239
You and your brothers are all liars. All of you are swindlers.

41:38.039 --> 41:39.070
Jae Hui.

41:39.739 --> 41:41.010
What brings you here?

41:41.369 --> 41:43.440
- Oh, hello. - Hey.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.079
What took you so long?

41:45.539 --> 41:48.179
Apparently, Ju Mi has filed a missing-person report for Jae Gu.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.150
- Did you know about it? - How would I know?

41:50.519 --> 41:52.619
By the way, why are you so stupid?

41:52.920 --> 41:55.949
What were you trying to do there with these guys in broad daylight?

41:56.219 --> 41:58.920
Don't ever tell anyone that I'm your brother. You embarrass me.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.130
Look who's talking.

42:00.130 --> 42:01.360
Please lock up these people.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.800
We couldn't even hit him once.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.800
Where on earth did Jae Gu find these useless idiots?

42:07.900 --> 42:09.699
Be quiet, please.

42:09.969 --> 42:12.400
Do you guys think that this place is your living room or what?

42:17.380 --> 42:19.710
Aren't we getting beef bone soup?

42:21.449 --> 42:23.280
- Goodness. - He's driving me insane.

42:23.849 --> 42:25.719
(Suspect, Ahn Jae Hui)

42:31.920 --> 42:33.489
- See you. - Bye.

42:35.530 --> 42:38.900
- Here's to A Jin's success! - Cheers!

42:44.639 --> 42:46.039
I told him to join us.

42:46.639 --> 42:47.840
- Cheers! - Cheers!

43:08.159 --> 43:09.190
Bok Ja.

43:21.909 --> 43:23.139
Bok Ja.

43:28.480 --> 43:29.610
Chairman Ahn.

43:32.320 --> 43:33.449
Thank you.

43:38.260 --> 43:39.320
Chairman Ahn.

43:45.199 --> 43:46.900
You've regained your consciousness?

43:56.940 --> 43:57.980
Chairman Ahn?

44:29.809 --> 44:31.309
You don't need...

44:32.309 --> 44:33.579
to explain everything.

44:36.409 --> 44:37.420
I just...

44:38.880 --> 44:41.090
wanted to know your true feelings for me.

44:45.119 --> 44:47.659
You can keep all the money.

44:48.989 --> 44:50.659
I don't need it.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.769
You don't need to run away that far...

44:58.469 --> 45:00.639
because it's all yours anyway.

45:08.750 --> 45:11.050
I'm... I'm sorry.

45:15.750 --> 45:17.320
You're the one...

45:17.989 --> 45:19.489
who brought me back to consciousness.

45:19.960 --> 45:21.090
Thank you.

45:22.130 --> 45:23.730
That's enough for me.

45:35.739 --> 45:36.840
Chairman Ahn.

45:38.579 --> 45:41.380
Shall we go home now?

45:43.550 --> 45:45.650
Please don't worry about anything...

45:46.250 --> 45:47.519
and wake up soon.

45:50.119 --> 45:51.219
So that...

45:52.460 --> 45:54.260
we can go on cruises together.

45:56.190 --> 45:58.030
Let's live like that.

46:10.579 --> 46:12.280
What? That woman is back?

46:12.639 --> 46:14.050
Where is she now?

46:14.480 --> 46:16.349
I'll pull all of her hair out.

46:16.409 --> 46:18.280
You're being thoughtless again.

46:18.420 --> 46:19.449
I think we should...

46:19.449 --> 46:21.889
discuss how we can divide the assets and properties fairly.

46:21.889 --> 46:22.949
Of course.

46:23.519 --> 46:26.190
That woman better not have spent all the money she took.

46:26.289 --> 46:27.960
You have no right to inherit anything.

46:28.659 --> 46:31.630
You got a loan with this house as a collateral and get conned?

46:31.860 --> 46:32.929
Well, that's...

46:32.929 --> 46:34.730
I was just trying to save the company.

46:34.730 --> 46:36.840
What will you do if Father finds out about it?

46:37.400 --> 46:38.900
How will Dad find out?

46:39.840 --> 46:41.409
He woke up.

46:43.909 --> 46:44.909
Sorry?

46:49.050 --> 46:50.320
Gosh, you startled me.

46:52.650 --> 46:53.949
Are you guys showing up just now?

46:54.690 --> 46:55.750
You're one to talk.

46:55.750 --> 46:58.019
Hey, Jae Hui.

46:59.420 --> 47:00.989
Chairman Ahn... I mean,

47:02.260 --> 47:03.960
your father collapsed,

47:05.300 --> 47:06.769
yet you didn't even visit him once.

47:07.730 --> 47:09.269
I was going to visit him.

47:09.630 --> 47:11.769
- But he company's situation... - Shut it.

47:12.400 --> 47:14.570
I want you gone from here...

47:15.739 --> 47:18.139
as well as from the house immediately.

47:24.780 --> 47:26.280
Isn't this...

47:27.289 --> 47:28.349
what you guys want?

47:29.949 --> 47:33.190
What did you guys do when I ran away with the money?

47:33.789 --> 47:35.090
All of you...

47:35.829 --> 47:37.130
were only after the money.

47:38.059 --> 47:39.630
Your father collapsed,

47:40.699 --> 47:41.869
but no one...

47:42.230 --> 47:43.900
None of you worried about him.

47:44.139 --> 47:46.539
What are you talking about? I came here to see him.

47:46.599 --> 47:49.840
Where is Jae Gu? Where on earth is he now?

47:54.110 --> 47:55.750
He tried to kill me.

47:58.050 --> 47:59.179
He broke into...

47:59.679 --> 48:01.420
my hotel room with a knife.

48:04.519 --> 48:05.559
So?

48:06.960 --> 48:08.329
Where is he now?

48:08.829 --> 48:09.989
Do you want to know?

48:11.800 --> 48:13.599
You colluded with Gu Bong Cheol...

48:14.030 --> 48:15.670
to take my money... I mean,

48:16.530 --> 48:17.639
this money.

48:19.199 --> 48:20.469
You lost your reason...

48:21.340 --> 48:23.340
just to get your hands on this money.

48:24.679 --> 48:25.679
Do you...

48:27.510 --> 48:28.510
Do you know...

48:29.679 --> 48:31.119
why I decided to come back?

48:33.179 --> 48:35.590
Because I didn't want to turn out like you people.

48:35.590 --> 48:36.619
Shut it.

48:38.789 --> 48:40.059
You're screwed now.

48:40.059 --> 48:41.460
I should be saying that to you.

48:43.230 --> 48:44.230
That house...

48:45.099 --> 48:47.269
is completely mine now.

48:48.500 --> 48:50.699
So... I want all of you...

48:50.769 --> 48:52.000
gone from that house.

48:53.239 --> 48:54.269
I don't...

48:55.110 --> 48:56.880
want to live with nasty people...

48:56.880 --> 48:59.139
in the same house.

49:00.280 --> 49:01.449
Who says that house is yours?

49:02.179 --> 49:04.550
You lost that house like a total idiot...

49:05.619 --> 49:06.920
and I got it back.

49:07.050 --> 49:09.590
How can you say you got it back? That's my dad's money.

49:09.590 --> 49:10.659
Right.

49:11.420 --> 49:13.460
I'm so glad you brought it up.

49:14.260 --> 49:15.289
Dad?

49:16.329 --> 49:18.730
You obviously knew that your dad collapsed. Then why...

49:19.360 --> 49:21.900
Why didn't you visit him when he was unconscious?

49:26.469 --> 49:28.369
I can't give you guys much time.

49:30.210 --> 49:31.239
I want you guys...

49:33.079 --> 49:35.949
gone from my house immediately.

49:53.369 --> 49:54.829
If I can be born again,

49:56.130 --> 49:57.500
I'll become a painter.

49:58.670 --> 50:00.670
You don't need to be born again to do that.

50:02.940 --> 50:04.539
You should learn how to paint...

50:04.980 --> 50:06.780
You can become a painter in this lifetime.

50:08.510 --> 50:09.579
Do you think...

50:10.349 --> 50:11.650
I can become a painter?

50:11.920 --> 50:14.320
Of course. It's more than possible.

50:15.349 --> 50:16.960
I'll introduce you to a painter.

50:17.719 --> 50:18.719
Really?

50:18.719 --> 50:21.130
Art is a hobby of many upper-class women.

50:21.329 --> 50:23.030
They like to look at paintings or paint themselves.

50:23.760 --> 50:25.559
Almost all of them do 1 of the 2.

50:27.630 --> 50:29.030
I registered you for golf lessons.

50:29.500 --> 50:31.400
You have to learn it starting tomorrow.

50:33.769 --> 50:34.809
Okay.

50:47.949 --> 50:48.949
Hello, madam.

50:50.420 --> 50:52.420
When does Oh Su Yeon's exhibition start?

50:52.559 --> 50:54.960
You'll have to wait a little while, madam.

50:55.389 --> 50:57.400
It's scheduled to start on the eighth of the next month,

50:57.530 --> 50:58.530
but...

50:58.860 --> 51:00.800
I'll give you a call before that.

51:01.969 --> 51:03.469
- Thank you. - Madam.

51:04.139 --> 51:06.070
Eastern-style paintings are popular these days.

51:06.070 --> 51:08.610
May I introduce you to a few talented artists?

51:10.610 --> 51:12.510
I wouldn't mind it,

51:13.710 --> 51:15.750
but I already chose Oh Su Yeon.

51:16.010 --> 51:17.880
Okay, I got it.

51:24.590 --> 51:25.760
What did you think?

51:26.659 --> 51:29.559
You were proactive and friendly.

51:29.559 --> 51:30.829
Whom did you observe?

51:31.329 --> 51:32.360
Well,

51:33.000 --> 51:34.400
I was obviously observing you.

51:34.400 --> 51:36.670
You shouldn't be observing me anymore.

51:38.440 --> 51:40.840
I no longer belong to the upper class.

51:40.869 --> 51:42.840
I took a step down the ladder at my own will.

51:43.170 --> 51:46.110
You should be studying that lady with whom I was speaking.

51:47.710 --> 51:50.880
Her low voice and the look on her face that makes you wonder...

51:50.880 --> 51:52.920
whether she respects your opinion.

51:53.590 --> 51:56.489
She uses nouns more than verbs in order to convey her messages,

51:56.590 --> 51:58.789
and she makes sure her short answers always sound respectful.

51:59.360 --> 52:01.559
She also has a habit of being brief and direct...

52:01.559 --> 52:03.730
when she needs to express her opinion.

52:03.730 --> 52:04.760
Also,

52:05.500 --> 52:06.769
when you're talking to people,

52:07.030 --> 52:09.230
you must look at them in the eye.

52:14.909 --> 52:16.110
I was curious.

52:16.909 --> 52:19.309
Why did she change her mind?

52:20.210 --> 52:22.710
Why did she come back so easily?

52:23.480 --> 52:26.250
What changed her mind?

52:27.650 --> 52:29.090
When she came back,

52:30.090 --> 52:32.489
the whole world was already suspicious of her.

52:33.730 --> 52:35.760
Everyone hated her.

52:37.760 --> 52:39.630
I bet she has an ulterior motive.

52:40.230 --> 52:41.929
Otherwise, she wouldn't come back like this.

52:42.099 --> 52:43.699
Where on earth is Jae Gu?

52:43.940 --> 52:46.539
She'll go to the police station tomorrow to give her statement.

52:47.309 --> 52:49.170
Then, Jae Gu will get arrested.

52:49.340 --> 52:51.539
We won't be able to find him if she doesn't do that.

52:51.579 --> 52:53.849
The police can't investigate without knowing what happened.

52:55.150 --> 52:56.179
I think...

52:56.880 --> 52:58.719
this house is under that woman's name now.

53:07.789 --> 53:11.760
Clean the house and look after your dad until we find a housekeeper.

53:13.630 --> 53:14.630
Me?

53:15.269 --> 53:16.329
Don't you want to do it?

53:17.269 --> 53:19.969
Then, move out immediately.

53:27.449 --> 53:28.849
What will you do about those guys?

53:29.179 --> 53:32.219
Our debt has gone from 17 million won to 25 million won.

53:32.280 --> 53:34.289
I never promised them any money.

53:34.820 --> 53:37.059
They offered to do it for free,

53:37.519 --> 53:39.460
saying that Mr. Han beat them up to a pulp in the past.

53:39.789 --> 53:41.360
They said it really hurt their pride.

53:41.889 --> 53:44.860
I'm telling you. You're dumb.

53:45.059 --> 53:46.329
Look who's talking.

53:47.429 --> 53:48.599
My gosh.

53:49.099 --> 53:50.139
Gosh, it's cold.

53:52.769 --> 53:53.809
Who is it?

53:59.440 --> 54:01.010
It's me, Ms. Park.

54:02.750 --> 54:05.320
What brings you here? I never ordered anything from you.

54:05.449 --> 54:07.590
I heard that you're back.

54:10.760 --> 54:13.190
That was rude of me. Please forgive me.

54:14.260 --> 54:17.630
How can I earn a living after my discourteous conduct toward you?

54:18.460 --> 54:21.570
I hope you can forgive me and I'll do my best.

54:26.340 --> 54:28.909
This is blowfish porridge.

54:29.139 --> 54:31.780
It's still warm. Please have some.

54:31.980 --> 54:33.449
You like this porridge.

54:35.449 --> 54:39.250
Chairman Ahn likes it, not me.

54:40.150 --> 54:43.420
He's still at the hospital, right?

54:46.389 --> 54:47.829
You should just eat it.

54:49.130 --> 54:51.360
I heard from Ms. Jo...

54:51.829 --> 54:55.800
that you were especially impressed by the blowfish porridge I made.

54:56.230 --> 54:58.340
That's why I made it for you.

54:59.500 --> 55:01.269
The kimchi has ripened, so it's delicious.

55:01.269 --> 55:02.340
Eat them together.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.179
I'll see you soon.

55:06.440 --> 55:07.449
Right.

55:07.550 --> 55:10.679
I know where Ms. Jo is now.

55:12.219 --> 55:14.119
I'll text you the address.

55:14.920 --> 55:17.619
It's not fair for those who have committed bad deeds...

55:17.619 --> 55:19.019
to live a good life.

55:39.940 --> 55:41.909
It's blowfish porridge. Come and have some.

55:41.909 --> 55:43.579
- Yes. - You like it.

55:44.750 --> 55:46.719
All right. Let's eat it together.

55:46.719 --> 55:50.260
Please don't worry about me. Just have as much as you like.

55:57.400 --> 55:58.960
Try this too. Here.

56:01.769 --> 56:04.239
Good. Eat up.

56:04.940 --> 56:07.739
Keep your eyes on the ball and lift it straight up all the way back.

56:07.809 --> 56:11.110
1, 2. Take a deep breath and do it again. Hit it.

56:11.110 --> 56:13.780
Great. You did that with the ball again though.

56:30.800 --> 56:33.929
1, 2. Remember to keep your eyes on the ball. That's the key.

56:34.070 --> 56:35.599
Nice. That's it.

56:35.929 --> 56:37.239
- Did I do it correctly? - Yes.

56:50.880 --> 56:53.650
Gosh, Dad! Dad, are you okay?

56:53.789 --> 56:54.989
My gosh, Dad. What should I do?

56:57.389 --> 56:59.719
- Don't these go so well together? - Yes, totally.

57:00.329 --> 57:02.030
Just a second. Someone is calling me.

57:03.260 --> 57:04.300
Hello?

57:06.530 --> 57:07.699
What did you just say?

57:19.039 --> 57:22.449
Goodness. Hey, I thought it was strange that she came back.

57:22.510 --> 57:24.179
That woman tried to kill Dad.

57:24.449 --> 57:26.920
Who will get all of his assets if he dies? She'll get everything.

57:26.989 --> 57:29.119
Slow down and tell me what happened. What do you mean?

57:29.489 --> 57:30.619
Dad...

57:30.860 --> 57:33.789
lost consciousness after eating blowfish porridge she gave him!

57:34.429 --> 57:35.659
I want to kill her.

57:37.800 --> 57:40.969
You murderer! Is this what you wanted?

57:41.199 --> 57:42.730
I was wondering why you came back.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Your plan was to kill Dad and get all of his assets, right?

57:45.239 --> 57:47.210
They're saying the poison has spread all over his body.

57:47.340 --> 57:50.079
How clever. I can't believe you tried to poison him to death!

57:52.079 --> 57:53.179
Where are you going?

57:55.179 --> 57:56.210
Gosh!

58:10.530 --> 58:12.929
It's possible that Park Bok Ja cooked up such a ruse...

58:12.929 --> 58:14.530
in order to kill Chairman Ahn,

58:14.929 --> 58:17.199
and get her hands on all of his assets.

58:17.869 --> 58:18.900
No,

58:19.039 --> 58:20.840
she didn't have any reason to do that.

58:21.170 --> 58:22.610
What do you mean by that?

59:10.519 --> 59:12.420
(Gu Bong Cheol)

59:23.269 --> 59:26.809
Chairman Ahn was not in his hospital room...

59:27.670 --> 59:29.139
at the time of Park Ji Yeong's death.

59:29.869 --> 59:32.210
You and Mr. Ahn Jae Seok are the only ones...

59:32.340 --> 59:34.079
that have firm alibis.

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.650
(The Lady in Dignity)

01:00:07.809 --> 01:00:09.610
I felt bad for Chairman Ahn.

01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:12.980
As you know, all of his children...

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.320
just think of that old man as their source of money.

01:00:15.889 --> 01:00:17.360
That's why...

01:00:17.619 --> 01:00:19.659
I wanted to take...

01:00:20.289 --> 01:00:21.960
really good care of him.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:23.900
But...

01:00:25.059 --> 01:00:26.599
But...

01:00:27.369 --> 01:00:29.800
Were you really trying to kill Ms. Park?

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.869
You better turn yourself in...

01:00:31.869 --> 01:00:33.269
before I report you to the police.

01:00:33.269 --> 01:00:35.210
Should I lie to them about going to the hotel...

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:36.469
to take the money from Park Bok Ja...

01:00:36.469 --> 01:00:38.380
and everything else that happened after that?

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.579
Say whatever you want.

01:00:39.579 --> 01:00:40.980
That woman is dead now.

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.610
I saw it with my own two eyes.

01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:43.880
Did you tell the police?

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.150
I mean, she came from nothing.

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:47.650
I couldn't stand her being all snobby.

01:00:47.719 --> 01:00:51.019
You and Mr. Ahn Jae Seok are the only ones...

01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:53.019
that have firm alibis.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.789
What should I do, Jae Gu? I'm so scared right now.

01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:57.260
I had to get blood on my hands!

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.230
Don't tell me... Did you kill her?

01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:01.300
To the point that I wanted to kill her.

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:04.869
Did you think that Park Ji Yeong intentionally gave you the porridge?

01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:05.900
I...

01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:08.139
died.
