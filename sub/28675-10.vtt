WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:01.459
How's the kid?

00:01.460 --> 00:02.469
I think he's yours.

00:03.360 --> 00:04.546
You guys got a name for him?

00:04.547 --> 00:05.922
She hasn't decided yet.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.639
State police have had
someone talking to them

00:07.640 --> 00:09.279
about you and your boys.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.094
- Who?
- Can't do this.

00:11.095 --> 00:12.761
Is that what you want
me to tell Livengood?

00:12.762 --> 00:13.799
I don't care what you tell him.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.474
Would Deran give all of this up for you?

00:16.475 --> 00:18.519
You guys heard of
Chronic Dread Festival?

00:18.520 --> 00:21.269
We can hit the acts. We
can hit their equipment.

00:21.270 --> 00:23.089
Smurf has cancer.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.649
What are you talking about?

00:24.650 --> 00:25.692
You wanna get tacos?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.719
One of the cooks there used to sell H.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.861
It kind of feels good...

00:28.862 --> 00:31.447
knowing I could score, choosing not to.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.658
I'm gonna go back to the house.

00:32.659 --> 00:34.409
- You want a lift?
- I think I'll walk.

00:34.410 --> 00:35.702
See you later.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.832
Look, I need you to help
me with something today.

00:39.833 --> 00:41.329
I gotta hurt somebody.

00:41.330 --> 00:44.127
Jesus, Deran. A cop?!

00:44.128 --> 00:45.849
I'm not gonna keep the
car running, what,

00:45.850 --> 00:47.544
so you take a bat to some cop.

00:47.545 --> 00:49.699
- Smurf.
- I want you to get everybody here

00:49.700 --> 00:50.709
in an hour.

00:50.710 --> 00:51.885
I have a job for us,

00:51.886 --> 00:54.721
and this time, I'll be joining you.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.264
I don't like kids.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.515
Well, what about the one in your belly?

00:57.516 --> 00:58.679
I'm pregnant.

02:09.539 --> 02:12.339
How long are you supposed
to feel like this?

02:12.340 --> 02:14.040
I don't know.

02:17.660 --> 02:19.300
We should get going.

02:21.560 --> 02:22.959
You can go.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.849
I'm fine on my own.

02:24.850 --> 02:26.589
You don't want this, tell me.

02:26.590 --> 02:27.599
I never said that.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.360
Yeah, well, you're not
saying anything, so...

02:36.920 --> 02:39.489
I wonder if Manny's
found something for us.

02:39.490 --> 02:42.519
It's only been a couple days.

02:42.520 --> 02:44.206
Well, I hope so.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.591
'Cause this is boring as shit.

03:07.450 --> 03:09.815
You seen Angela this morning?

03:11.120 --> 03:13.629
No. She's not here?

03:13.630 --> 03:15.649
No.

03:15.650 --> 03:16.779
You want toast?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.198
No.

03:19.260 --> 03:22.786
Maybe she's working the breakfast shift.

03:25.456 --> 03:27.332
Smurf came home.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.127
She did? When?

03:31.128 --> 03:33.881
This morning. Early.

03:35.610 --> 03:37.219
Did she say where she's been?

03:37.220 --> 03:39.552
She said to get everybody over here.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.679
So stick around.

03:53.230 --> 03:54.769
You been inside?

03:54.770 --> 03:56.830
No.

04:07.940 --> 04:10.650
Renn had our baby last night.

04:13.380 --> 04:15.989
How's she doing?

04:15.990 --> 04:17.790
Good.

04:23.490 --> 04:24.760
Well, that's it?

04:25.960 --> 04:27.840
How's Renn doing?

04:29.860 --> 04:31.269
What do you want me to say?

04:31.270 --> 04:35.009
I don't know. You could
ask about the kid.

04:35.010 --> 04:36.568
Boy? Girl?

04:37.880 --> 04:39.879
Is it a boy?

04:39.880 --> 04:42.241
Yeah.

04:45.180 --> 04:47.149
Where's Smurf?

04:47.150 --> 04:49.359
Nobody's seen her yet.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.220
Yeah, man, I need to eat something.

04:56.090 --> 04:57.129
Hey.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.881
How you feeling?

04:58.882 --> 05:01.802
You can eat after we talk.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.653
I have a job for us.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.779
It's quick.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.759
Nothing fancy. Big score.

05:24.760 --> 05:25.999
Wait. Aren't we gonna talk about...

05:26.000 --> 05:28.829
I know a guy who's holed
up in the desert.

05:28.830 --> 05:31.789
One of these survivalist types.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.979
He's been stockpiling
gold since the '70s.

05:34.980 --> 05:37.369
So, I went out and took a look at it.

05:37.370 --> 05:40.059
There's at least $2 million worth there.

05:40.060 --> 05:43.819
- Smurf, we should...
- I'm not finished talking, Deran.

05:43.820 --> 05:47.509
He stores the gold in a bunker he built.

05:47.510 --> 05:50.719
Now, here's a culvert
that runs alongside it,

05:50.720 --> 05:53.279
but on the county property side,

05:53.280 --> 05:56.389
so we can dig our way in from there.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.459
Just haul the shit out.

05:58.460 --> 06:00.399
- Gold?
- It's better than cash.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.619
How do you know this guy?

06:01.620 --> 06:03.739
I've done business with
him over the years.

06:03.740 --> 06:06.539
You just decided you
wanted to rip him off?

06:06.540 --> 06:09.219
I didn't say I liked doing
business with him, did I?

06:09.220 --> 06:11.079
I thought we didn't make jobs personal.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.269
It's not personal, baby. I
just don't need him anymore.

06:14.270 --> 06:17.649
And he's sitting on a lot of gold.

06:17.650 --> 06:18.659
I want it.

06:18.660 --> 06:20.159
So, that's why you called this meeting,

06:20.160 --> 06:22.960
just to... pitch us a job?

06:22.966 --> 06:27.899
Is there something else you
wanted to discuss, Deran?

06:27.900 --> 06:30.009
We know you're sick, Smurf.

06:30.010 --> 06:32.049
I mean, Pope told us.

06:32.050 --> 06:34.599
I have maps...

06:34.600 --> 06:37.439
topographic and engineering maps...

06:37.440 --> 06:42.079
from the county that give you
all the information you need.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.869
Let's get going on this...

06:43.870 --> 06:45.780
now.

06:52.270 --> 06:54.622
Are you kidding me?

06:58.085 --> 07:00.679
So that's it, huh?

07:00.680 --> 07:02.279
Don't talk about it,

07:02.280 --> 07:06.389
don't ask questions, we
just pull another job.

07:06.390 --> 07:07.677
What did you expect?

07:07.678 --> 07:10.472
I don't know. Maybe
normal human emotion.

07:10.473 --> 07:11.679
From Smurf?

07:11.680 --> 07:12.849
Yeah, I don't blame her, man.

07:14.140 --> 07:15.879
I mean, who the hell wants
to talk about cancer?

07:15.880 --> 07:18.059
Look, I'm not asking to hold hands

07:18.060 --> 07:19.839
and go through family photos and shit.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.689
I just think she needs to
talk about it with somebody.

07:21.690 --> 07:22.839
I think she needs to
deal with it somehow.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.152
She is dealing with it.

07:24.153 --> 07:26.539
She wants to do a job.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.699
If she's got cancer, she
shouldn't be pulling a job

07:28.700 --> 07:29.783
- right now...
- It's what she wants.

07:29.784 --> 07:32.139
If it's as big as she says it is,

07:32.140 --> 07:33.159
then maybe we should do it.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.579
All right, J. That's real touching.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.416
It's not about the gold, all right?

07:38.417 --> 07:39.899
It's about doing one more score

07:39.900 --> 07:43.079
and then riding off into the sunset.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.740
We shouldn't even be considering it.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.679
My shoulder's still all jacked up

07:47.680 --> 07:49.639
from that shit show of a
job you pulled us into.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.629
She says it's a good score.

07:51.630 --> 07:53.599
You gonna tell Smurf no?

07:53.600 --> 07:55.725
You go right ahead.

07:59.340 --> 08:00.719
Okay, fine.

08:00.720 --> 08:01.909
Great.

08:01.910 --> 08:03.315
You get us a car.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.439
Four-wheel drive... it's
gonna have to carry

08:05.440 --> 08:06.729
all of us plus the haul.

08:06.730 --> 08:08.279
Get a big-ass SUV.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.359
We can beef up the suspension.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.099
Sounds like we're gonna
have to dig, a lot.

08:12.100 --> 08:15.619
Acetylene torches, power
auger, picks, shovels.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.530
We'll buy whatever we don't have.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.559
Who the hell is this asshole?

08:23.370 --> 08:25.019
Who are you?

08:25.020 --> 08:26.369
Uh, Cody?

08:26.370 --> 08:27.381
Yeah, what's it to you?

08:27.382 --> 08:28.479
North County Liquor.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.170
I got a delivery for, uh, Janine Cody.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.579
Right here.

08:31.580 --> 08:32.639
Where do you want it?

08:32.640 --> 08:35.847
Behind the bar.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.578
It's on the other side of the pool.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.919
I'm having a party at
6:00 p.m. Don't be late.

09:01.370 --> 09:03.239
You should get going.

09:03.240 --> 09:06.339
It's gonna be hard to
find the right SUV.

09:06.340 --> 09:09.430
What's gonna happen when Smurf's gone?

09:13.370 --> 09:14.929
What do you mean?

09:14.930 --> 09:16.479
I mean are we gonna keep living here?

09:16.480 --> 09:17.719
Are we gonna keep doing jobs?

09:17.720 --> 09:19.279
Why the hell wouldn't we?

09:19.280 --> 09:22.859
Well, Deran's got his bar.
He's got Adrian.

09:22.860 --> 09:25.509
Craig could bail out to Mexico anytime.

09:25.510 --> 09:28.151
Nobody's going anywhere.

09:29.620 --> 09:31.799
Have you spoken to
Smurf about the house,

09:31.800 --> 09:33.439
about the accounts, everything else?

09:33.440 --> 09:36.840
We'll figure it all out later.
Go get the SUV.

09:47.020 --> 09:51.799
I knew my mom was gonna die
way before it happened.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.969
It got real bad.

09:54.970 --> 09:57.159
I tried to cook her less.

09:57.160 --> 10:00.419
It just pissed her off.

10:00.420 --> 10:02.719
I wondered if I was gonna find her

10:02.720 --> 10:06.819
in the bathroom, or in her bed.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.816
She died on the couch.

10:11.090 --> 10:13.359
So I called 911.

10:13.360 --> 10:16.440
Then I called Smurf.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.829
I was in prison.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.279
I should have been there for you.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.699
- I'm sorry.
- No, you don't have to be sorry.

10:28.940 --> 10:30.830
I've just got no one left to call.

10:39.090 --> 10:41.479
- Hello?
- Hello, Josh.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.975
Hey. What's up?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.429
You ghosted me after the show.

10:45.430 --> 10:47.119
Oh, yeah, I've been a little busy.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.898
I'll bet.

10:48.899 --> 10:51.959
So, uh, your roommate says
you're home in San Luis?

10:51.960 --> 10:53.569
Yeah, just for a little while.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.359
Liar.

10:56.360 --> 11:02.739
I think you're at 6554
West Ditmar in Oceanside,

11:02.740 --> 11:04.499
where you live with Janine Cody,

11:04.500 --> 11:06.330
your grandmother, who was
arrested for murder,

11:06.333 --> 11:08.339
oh, and your uncle, Andrew Cody,

11:08.340 --> 11:11.179
who was in jail for armed robbery.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.019
I think you have me
mistaken for someone else.

11:16.020 --> 11:18.219
We need to meet, Josh.

11:18.220 --> 11:21.509
I'll text you where.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.459
Mr. Dolan.

11:27.460 --> 11:29.199
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.759
Uh, thanks for meeting me here.

11:30.760 --> 11:31.769
- Yeah.
- It's the only spare minute I have to eat.

11:31.770 --> 11:33.299
- Yeah, it's no problem.
- Yes.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.439
Uh, you should get a dark tie for court.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.821
Okay.

11:37.980 --> 11:39.959
I'm not gonna sugar coat it for you.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.879
This is not a sympathetic bench.

11:41.880 --> 11:45.679
Our judge is Anthony Jerome.
He's a Reagan appointee.

11:45.680 --> 11:49.219
I recommend we file for reassignment.

11:49.220 --> 11:50.239
Sure.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.625
So, charges are trafficking
and distribution

11:52.626 --> 11:54.659
of a Schedule II controlled substance.

11:54.660 --> 11:56.840
We should petition the
distribution charge,

11:56.841 --> 11:58.959
try to reduce your sentence a bit.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.339
Okay, uh... reduce how much?

12:02.340 --> 12:05.619
Mandatory minimum for
the trafficking charge

12:05.620 --> 12:07.759
is 15 years

12:07.760 --> 12:10.079
and a $250,000 fine.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.280
Distribution adds another five.

12:14.380 --> 12:15.985
Jesus.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.619
There was a reduced-sentence
recommendation

12:18.620 --> 12:19.820
on the earlier filing.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.719
Any idea why they pulled it?

12:22.720 --> 12:25.879
The, uh... The DEA agent said
that if I helped get Jack,

12:25.880 --> 12:27.379
they'd go easy on me.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.582
Then he brought in a
state cop who wanted me

12:30.583 --> 12:32.659
to gather evidence on someone else.

12:32.660 --> 12:34.504
I didn't want to do it.

12:35.980 --> 12:37.549
Who was the other person?

12:37.550 --> 12:40.569
My roommate.

12:40.570 --> 12:43.679
Boyfriend, actually.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.339
The culvert only intersects

12:45.340 --> 12:47.679
with the property line
in this one spot here,

12:47.680 --> 12:50.359
and the... the entrance looks
like it's like 60 feet away.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.839
That's far enough in to
keep the noise down...

12:51.840 --> 12:55.239
Why didn't you tell us sooner, man?

12:55.240 --> 12:56.759
She told me not to.

12:56.760 --> 12:57.939
Yeah, who gives a shit what she wants?

12:57.940 --> 12:59.446
She's our mother.

13:00.320 --> 13:03.239
She taught us how to fight and lie...

13:03.240 --> 13:06.329
and cheat and steal.

13:06.330 --> 13:09.739
Not exactly Mother of the Year material.

13:09.740 --> 13:12.700
You ever have an empty stomach?

13:12.709 --> 13:15.139
You ever sleep in a car?

13:15.140 --> 13:17.630
There you go, defending her.

13:18.680 --> 13:21.670
Always defending her after
everything she's done to you.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.099
You're my brother.

13:32.100 --> 13:35.439
When you call me with
a problem, I show up.

13:36.590 --> 13:39.189
We're family, whether
you like it or not.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.399
We're family.

13:55.910 --> 13:57.045
Candace.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.119
You look good.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.550
Craig Cody.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.429
- Been a while.
- Mm.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.210
I'll be back in a minute, honey.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.029
"Honey"?

14:19.030 --> 14:20.759
I did not call her.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.369
She just showed up.

14:23.370 --> 14:25.950
- Lucky you.
- Yeah.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.034
Where's the baby?

14:29.035 --> 14:31.496
Uh, nurse took him to
run some kind of test.

14:42.450 --> 14:44.216
You look tired.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.689
You should get some sleep.

14:46.690 --> 14:48.559
I'm just hungry.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.359
The food here sucks.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.899
- Candace sucks.
- Mm.

14:53.900 --> 14:57.359
Well, you know, they
got stuff downstairs.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.950
Want me to go grab you something?

15:01.070 --> 15:02.699
Take my mom with you.

15:02.700 --> 15:03.770
- What? No.
- Come...

15:03.778 --> 15:05.679
Craig, come on.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.279
If I sit here listening to her judge me

15:07.280 --> 15:09.219
for one more hour, I am going to snap.

15:09.220 --> 15:10.780
Dude, are you serious?

15:17.360 --> 15:18.960
Fine.

15:34.870 --> 15:38.604
Can I... Can I explain?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.009
Sure.

15:47.380 --> 15:52.201
There are things about my
family that I'm not proud of.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.239
At school when people found out

15:54.240 --> 15:57.660
who my grandmother was, my uncles, um...

15:57.665 --> 16:00.626
they would stop talking to me.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.463
They were afraid.

16:09.270 --> 16:12.764
You are so... full of shit.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.139
Dude, it took my dad's PI two days

16:16.140 --> 16:18.609
to find out all this shit.

16:18.610 --> 16:22.389
But it really made me start to wonder...

16:22.390 --> 16:23.749
a liar...

16:23.750 --> 16:27.069
from a family of criminals shows up,

16:27.070 --> 16:30.019
starts asking all of
us about our parents

16:30.020 --> 16:31.900
and what they do...

16:32.930 --> 16:35.285
... then Meredith's show gets robbed?

16:40.440 --> 16:43.168
I had nothing to do with that.

16:44.740 --> 16:48.920
I don't believe a God damn word
that comes out of your mouth.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.513
Do you want money?

16:54.920 --> 16:59.059
Why the hell would I need
to ask you for money?

17:03.356 --> 17:05.989
That's my Chalkboard login.

17:05.990 --> 17:10.862
I get 10 grand a month
for keeping a 3.0.

17:13.569 --> 17:15.799
You get me an "A" in Stats,

17:15.800 --> 17:18.059
or I hand over everything the PI found

17:18.060 --> 17:20.740
to my mom... and the cops.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.618
You should probably get on it.

17:27.619 --> 17:30.424
There's a bunch of homework due today.

17:35.960 --> 17:40.299
♪ I don't care if the fish don't bite ♪

17:40.300 --> 17:45.429
♪ Long as I'm home where I belong ♪

17:46.800 --> 17:49.239
Hey.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.699
Hello, hello.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.650
Hi.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.325
Well, well.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.449
They return.

17:58.450 --> 17:59.529
Jake!

17:59.530 --> 18:01.319
Get your ass up.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.249
Mmm, something smells good.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.170
That's 'cause it is good.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.714
Look who's back.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.959
Hey.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.039
All right.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.599
We scouted a bank in Bonsall.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.723
Bunch of Marine brass from Pendleton

18:18.724 --> 18:20.059
living out there.

18:20.060 --> 18:21.259
Federal paychecks,

18:21.260 --> 18:23.352
cashed on the 5th and the 20th.

18:23.353 --> 18:25.339
Everybody feel fresh and rested?

18:25.340 --> 18:26.390
Yeah, man.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.859
- And you two?
- Yep.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.903
Where's our room?

18:32.904 --> 18:34.539
We're tired.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.100
Far left.

18:39.850 --> 18:43.189
Wash up. Dinner should be ready soon.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.939
- Go back. You missed one.
- You got it.

19:03.940 --> 19:07.279
Rose, you're a lifesaver.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.479
Doing all this on such short notice?

19:09.480 --> 19:10.769
Thank you.

19:10.770 --> 19:13.259
No problem.

19:13.260 --> 19:15.612
I've been on the phone all morning.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.429
It's gonna be a great party.

19:18.430 --> 19:20.702
Looks like it.

19:21.730 --> 19:24.759
I-I don't think you have enough meat.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.750
- You'll have leftovers.
- Will I?

19:31.600 --> 19:33.499
How's it work out for you?

19:33.500 --> 19:34.756
The cart.

19:34.757 --> 19:38.051
Keeps me busy.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.260
Busy's good.

19:42.310 --> 19:44.979
Here, this is for you.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.936
Put that in your purse fast, okay?

19:49.520 --> 19:52.984
- Uh, Smurf...
- Don't think about it.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.819
When I needed him,

19:55.820 --> 19:57.440
your son was there.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.929
And when it was time for him to talk,

20:00.930 --> 20:04.035
he kept his mouth shut.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.769
You raised a stand-up kid.

20:07.770 --> 20:09.667
You take care of him when he gets out.

20:28.230 --> 20:29.980
Hey.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.860
Hey, Jess.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.414
- How's it going?
- Not good.

20:53.520 --> 20:57.759
I should go pick up Charlie
from the babysitter's.

20:57.760 --> 20:58.840
I'll call Mom,

20:58.841 --> 21:01.659
figure out when we can all get together.

21:01.660 --> 21:02.803
Okay.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.719
Jess.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.059
I take it you got some bad news.

21:37.060 --> 21:39.089
15 years.

21:42.070 --> 21:43.885
Look, I told you, I...

21:43.886 --> 21:45.419
No, stop.

21:45.420 --> 21:46.999
I need some more time.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.849
There is no way to fix this.
It is what it is.

21:56.270 --> 21:59.419
It's pretty crazy, right?

21:59.420 --> 22:01.319
Your family's been ripping people off

22:01.320 --> 22:03.905
since we were little
and never gets caught.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.599
I make one bad call,

22:05.600 --> 22:07.689
and I'm gonna spend 15 years in prison.

22:18.629 --> 22:21.959
Can I be frank with you?

22:21.960 --> 22:23.959
Sure.

22:23.960 --> 22:27.039
Renn doesn't volunteer much information.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.932
But you're here, so I'm
assuming you're the father.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.685
That child's coming home with me.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.259
I've already spoken to my husband,

22:35.260 --> 22:37.259
and we want to pursue an adoption.

22:37.260 --> 22:40.439
Renn's not gonna like it at first.

22:40.440 --> 22:43.020
But it's the best course of action.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.159
I need you need to help me convince her.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.650
Why would I do that?

22:47.658 --> 22:49.459
You think it's okay to bring a child

22:49.460 --> 22:50.660
into your lifestyles?

22:50.661 --> 22:53.455
And what's our lifestyle?

22:53.456 --> 22:55.624
I know how Renn makes her money.

22:55.625 --> 22:59.419
And... I know your family.

22:59.420 --> 23:02.380
How Smurf raised you was wrong.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.659
And I'm very sorry you and your brothers

23:04.660 --> 23:08.260
had to deal with that, but
it needs to stop here.

23:10.590 --> 23:14.226
This will be the best
thing for everyone.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.179
Excuse me.

23:32.180 --> 23:34.139
One second.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.479
That'll be $11.32.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.139
That's with my senior discount?

23:39.140 --> 23:41.059
You have the same meal
every day, Mr. Craft.

23:41.060 --> 23:42.399
It's always the same price.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.879
Hey.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.969
Is Angela here?

23:46.970 --> 23:49.135
She never showed up for her shift.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.299
She call you?

23:51.300 --> 23:53.909
No. She didn't.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.849
Well, if you find her,

23:55.850 --> 23:57.659
tell her she doesn't work here anymore.

23:57.660 --> 23:59.563
I'm reporting that to
her parole officer.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.319
$11.32.

24:06.650 --> 24:09.039
Uh, Professor Daniels?

24:09.040 --> 24:11.100
Hey, Josh.

24:11.130 --> 24:12.689
You haven't been in class in a few days.

24:12.690 --> 24:13.699
What's up?

24:13.700 --> 24:16.460
Um, can I talk to you about something?

24:16.470 --> 24:18.539
Yeah, sure.

24:18.540 --> 24:22.639
I-I don't want to get
anyone in trouble, um,

24:22.640 --> 24:24.119
but students have been handing out

24:24.120 --> 24:25.439
their login information,

24:25.440 --> 24:27.959
paying people to do the work for them.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.340
I thought you'd... I thought
you'd want to know.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.840
Olivia Danner?

24:37.226 --> 24:39.319
He should be ready
to eat in a little bit.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.599
Okay, well, can we do
something about these sheets?

24:41.600 --> 24:43.629
They just keep riding up my ass.

24:43.630 --> 24:45.319
It's like a train wreck down there.

24:45.320 --> 24:48.109
Wow. That's something I can't unhear.

24:48.110 --> 24:50.199
Of course.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.741
You want to hold baby while I help Mom

24:51.742 --> 24:53.379
get comfortable?

24:53.380 --> 24:55.909
Uh... yeah, sure.

24:55.910 --> 24:58.859
Hey, bud.

24:58.860 --> 25:00.199
All right.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.599
Here you go, bud.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.961
Hey.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.469
Reef's kind of a cool name, right?

25:08.470 --> 25:09.499
Yeah.

25:09.500 --> 25:12.469
Yeah, yeah. I like it.

25:12.470 --> 25:14.799
Hey.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.080
I'll have some new linens brought up.

25:17.090 --> 25:19.439
I think Mom's ready.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.728
Yeah. I think he is, too.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.108
You got him?

25:30.200 --> 25:31.809
Hi.

25:37.660 --> 25:40.879
- Yes?
- Yeah, you should go.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.199
Excuse me?

25:42.200 --> 25:44.460
You're not taking my baby anywhere.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.519
You need to think this through.

25:48.520 --> 25:51.439
I have thought it through.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.659
Neither of you are fit to be parents.

25:53.660 --> 25:55.049
Oh, yeah?

25:55.050 --> 25:56.359
Neither of us?

25:56.360 --> 25:58.569
Because the first time
that Renn did coke,

25:58.570 --> 26:01.899
she got it from your purse.

26:01.900 --> 26:04.020
I have been sober for nine years.

26:04.021 --> 26:05.759
Oh, how about your dipshit
second husband of yours,

26:05.760 --> 26:07.499
Steve was it?

26:07.500 --> 26:08.579
You know, the one that you caught

26:08.580 --> 26:09.777
trying to get in the shower with her

26:09.778 --> 26:11.759
when she was, like, what, 13?

26:11.760 --> 26:13.239
Did Renn tell you that?

26:13.240 --> 26:15.339
Because it never happened.

26:15.340 --> 26:16.979
That's bullshit.

26:16.980 --> 26:19.999
She slept on the beach for like a week.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.459
And I know that because I was the one

26:21.460 --> 26:23.659
who was bringing her blankets and food.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.859
Hey, I, um... I gotta go.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.980
I got some shit I gotta take care of.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.480
Hey, um, gracias.

26:48.580 --> 26:49.899
For what?

26:49.900 --> 26:52.653
Candace.

26:53.940 --> 26:56.100
Yeah.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.629
I'll make sure that
everything's ready for you both

27:06.630 --> 27:08.080
when you come back to the house.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.600
All right.

27:36.980 --> 27:39.389
- 'Sup, Pope?
- I'm looking for Angela.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.419
Have you seen her?

27:41.420 --> 27:42.452
Yesterday.

27:42.453 --> 27:44.413
She was with, uh... Julia's kid.

27:44.414 --> 27:47.479
Yo, he's big now.

27:47.480 --> 27:49.139
When'd she get out?

27:53.400 --> 27:55.160
She pick up from you?

27:56.680 --> 27:59.759
Come on, man. Don't lie to me.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.689
Hey.

28:01.690 --> 28:04.639
I-I didn't party with her. I swear.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.279
You know how it is.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.729
If Angela wants dope,
she's gonna find it.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.560
At least with me, she's getting quality.

28:10.570 --> 28:12.341
I'm not slinging Mexican brown

28:12.342 --> 28:14.060
in the bathrooms at the Harbor.

Handle it.

44:30.880 --> 44:33.419
Or I'll have to turn it over to Pope.

Adrian.

44:43.420 --> 44:45.289
Hey, Smurf.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.490
Hey.

45:04.510 --> 45:06.759
Hey.

45:06.760 --> 45:09.499
Mind if I hang?

45:09.500 --> 45:10.708
No.

45:11.920 --> 45:15.588
I was trying to get him to sleep.

45:26.010 --> 45:28.519
You guys need anything, or...

45:28.520 --> 45:29.960
No, we're good.

45:37.660 --> 45:40.400
I was thinking Reef's
kinda cheesy, though.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.539
Yeah?

45:42.540 --> 45:45.399
I want to name him something normal.

45:45.400 --> 45:47.661
Like what?

45:47.662 --> 45:51.833
My uncle's name is Nicholas.
