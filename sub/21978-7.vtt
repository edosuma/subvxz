01:08.740 --> 01:11.839
Like, what do you suppose
Shredder's up to this time ?

01:12.151 --> 01:14.247
Michelangelo, you heard
April's message.

01:14.589 --> 01:17.518
He's been spotted on the roof
of the World Trade Center.

01:17.881 --> 01:19.674
It's for sure he's not
there for the view.

01:20.938 --> 01:23.071
Baxter, you oaf,
what's taking so long ?

01:23.603 --> 01:25.372
It'll be ready in a second, master.

01:25.973 --> 01:28.642
There. This should create
a giant force field

01:29.014 --> 01:30.294
between the 2 towers.

01:30.894 --> 01:32.361
What went wrong ?

01:32.701 --> 01:37.208
Oh, no ! I forgot to reverse the
polarity of the neutron flow !

01:37.689 --> 01:39.378
Baxter, you bumbling idiot !

01:39.707 --> 01:42.531
Why am I condemned
to work with amateurs ?

01:42.978 --> 01:45.556
Hey, April was right.
there's tin-head now !

01:46.101 --> 01:47.330
I wonder what he's up to ?

01:47.737 --> 01:49.848
Blast the luck !
The turtles are here,

01:50.061 --> 01:52.106
and there's no time to
finish the experiment !

01:52.336 --> 01:54.586
Quickly ! We cannot risk
losing this equipment !

01:55.242 --> 01:58.284
The coward ! It's just
like Shredder to run away.

01:58.595 --> 01:59.996
We'll never catch him now.

02:00.313 --> 02:02.244
Looks like the party's over, dudes.

02:02.701 --> 02:04.071
We might as well boogie.

02:06.922 --> 02:10.095
Bad news, master Splinter.
Shredder is up to something

02:10.449 --> 02:13.046
But he ran off before
we could discover what.

02:13.352 --> 02:16.439
All we know is, it had something
to do with the twin towers.

02:16.850 --> 02:19.675
Sooner or later, 
he will reveal his plan.

02:20.262 --> 02:22.226
Until then, we can only wait.

02:22.507 --> 02:26.613
Yeah--and eat ! 
This turtle is Mondo hungry !

02:27.569 --> 02:30.043
Look alive, dudes.
Comin' atcha !

02:33.960 --> 02:35.317
You said a mouthful !

02:36.723 --> 02:38.170
Months of work ruined !

02:38.579 --> 02:40.760
Oh, you imbecilic incompetent !

02:41.134 --> 02:43.209
Thanks to you, I now have to grovel

02:43.444 --> 02:45.821
before that hateful
bag of brains, Krang.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.514
But why, sir, a garbage heap ?

02:48.842 --> 02:50.638
Because this is the site he chose

02:50.890 --> 02:52.431
for the transdimensional
convergence.

02:53.009 --> 02:54.648
I think he did it just to annoy me.

02:55.127 --> 02:56.645
That must be Krang now.

02:57.050 --> 02:58.249
Shredder here.

02:58.933 --> 03:03.397
Well, Shredder, 
how's the air down there ?

03:05.288 --> 03:06.847
Very humorous.

03:07.235 --> 03:11.855
Well, have you disposed of
those annoying amphibians yet ?

03:12.132 --> 03:16.422
There's been a setback, thanks to
my miserable excuse for an assistant !

03:16.751 --> 03:20.640
Enough ! The turtles
must be destroyed

03:21.038 --> 03:24.347
Before we begin our
conquest of earth.

03:24.709 --> 03:26.327
I need more help !

03:26.702 --> 03:28.411
Send me Rocksteady and Bebop.

03:28.716 --> 03:31.787
Maybe brawn will work
where brains have failed.

03:32.289 --> 03:35.500
I'm sending you both
back to earth immediately.

03:35.781 --> 03:38.278
Oh, boy !
Yo !

03:39.120 --> 03:40.840
I'm ready to open the portal,

03:41.277 --> 03:43.800
but the interdimensional
energy balance

03:43.800 --> 03:46.065
is very fragile at the moment.

03:46.408 --> 03:49.342
I can't send these two
without having someone

03:49.342 --> 03:52.865
sent back to Dimension X in exchange.

03:54.192 --> 03:57.933
No problem. I have
the perfect candidate.

04:00.953 --> 04:02.882
Good riddance to bad rubbish !

04:03.256 --> 04:04.726
But master...

04:10.680 --> 04:14.302
Thanks, boss. I had
enough to eat anyway.

04:14.532 --> 04:16.512
Thanks for rescuing us, boss.

04:16.858 --> 04:19.789
I didn't do it out of kindness.

04:20.043 --> 04:22.192
You're here to help me
eliminate the turtles.

04:22.508 --> 04:24.410
Ooh, no problem, boss !

04:24.659 --> 04:27.745
Those shellbacks are history.

04:28.327 --> 04:31.070
So, like, what do we do now ?

04:31.383 --> 04:35.439
I'll strike at their weakest point
... April O'Neill.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.339
April O'Neill ?

04:39.682 --> 04:40.774
That's me.

04:41.055 --> 04:42.739
I've got a flower delivery for you.

04:43.772 --> 04:46.733
Oh, my goodness. How romantic.

04:47.202 --> 04:48.167
Who's it from ?

04:48.513 --> 04:49.991
I don't know, Irma.

04:50.244 --> 04:52.788
Somebody grabbed it before
I could look at the card.

04:53.033 --> 04:55.110
That is, if it had a card.

04:57.219 --> 04:59.482
It has such a strange fragrance !

04:59.823 --> 05:01.648
Do you suppose
it's from the turtles ?

05:01.971 --> 05:05.154
I keep telling you,
I hardly know the turtles.

05:05.529 --> 05:09.148
Oh, I wish some guy
would send me flowers...

05:09.351 --> 05:12.039
Even if he were green
and had flippers.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.913
You just made a delivery to channel 6.

05:19.181 --> 05:21.195
Y-y-y-yes. Yes, sir.

05:21.472 --> 05:23.172
To April O-O'Neill.

05:23.725 --> 05:26.449
Excellent. You've done your job well.

05:31.651 --> 05:34.347
So you see, turtles,
it just wouldn't work out.

05:34.576 --> 05:37.961
We're from different
worlds--really different worlds.

05:38.681 --> 05:40.824
April, what brings you here ?

05:41.222 --> 05:44.786
I've got to talk to
the turtles, master Splinter.

05:45.059 --> 05:47.357
They are not here.
Is something wrong ?

05:47.698 --> 05:51.132
Well, they sent me
this gorgeous plant

05:51.381 --> 05:54.236
And while it's flattering,
I just don't think...

05:54.437 --> 05:55.683
A doku plant ?!

05:56.138 --> 05:58.273
I think the turtles are really cute, but...

05:58.917 --> 06:00.541
What's wrong ?
Why did you...

06:00.769 --> 06:02.083
April, listen to me !

06:02.083 --> 06:03.811
Did you inhale the blossoms ?

06:04.064 --> 06:07.120
Why, yes. Like i said,
it's a lovely fragrance,

06:07.391 --> 06:11.129
But--oh, suddenly I feel so strange.

06:11.455 --> 06:12.892
April !

06:18.854 --> 06:20.627
Aah ! But I can be of help to you.

06:20.627 --> 06:23.704
I'm a scientist !

06:24.294 --> 06:27.540
So am I, and I don't
need the assistance

06:27.540 --> 06:29.962
of a measly earth creature.

06:30.239 --> 06:33.094
Into the disintegrator unit with him !

06:37.544 --> 06:38.868
Let me out !

06:42.191 --> 06:44.760
There's been a terrible mistake !

06:57.600 --> 07:00.334
No container can hold me !

07:03.456 --> 07:07.258
There's been a malfunction
in the disintegrator unit !

07:17.384 --> 07:20.361
Treat me like an insect, will they ?

07:21.129 --> 07:22.172
Stop !

07:31.094 --> 07:32.404
We're back, master Splinter.

07:33.674 --> 07:35.031
What's happened to April ?!

07:35.320 --> 07:37.132
Someone sent her a doku plant,

07:37.553 --> 07:39.552
a rare flower from the far east.

07:39.817 --> 07:41.439
Its fragrance is deadly.

07:42.002 --> 07:43.406
Is she...

07:43.718 --> 07:45.916
no, but she will not last long

07:46.428 --> 07:48.133
unless i can prepare an antidote,

07:48.628 --> 07:51.378
but to do so, I will need a gazai leaf.

07:51.968 --> 07:55.091
I do not know where one may be
found in this part of the world.

07:55.781 --> 07:57.292
Here is what it looks like.

07:57.742 --> 08:00.221
Hey, there's a greenhouse
uptown that sells rare plants.

08:00.221 --> 08:01.584
We might find some there.

08:01.878 --> 08:04.416
Well, come on, dudes,
Let's haul shell !

08:04.917 --> 08:07.348
Hurry, my turtles.
Without the gazai leaf,

08:07.583 --> 08:10.202
she will not survive beyond nightfall.

08:11.528 --> 08:13.126
Baxter turned into what ?!

08:13.402 --> 08:15.373
That's right, a fly !

08:15.631 --> 08:17.881
It must have been in the unit with him.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.756
Instead of vaporizing him,

08:20.171 --> 08:22.968
it cross-mutated him with an insect.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.655
And you let him escape
through the portal ?

08:26.012 --> 08:27.083
Brilliant !

08:27.897 --> 08:31.123
I didn't have to warn you, you know.

08:32.934 --> 08:36.568
Raphael, this nursery Of yours
better have One of those plants.

08:37.113 --> 08:40.436
Yeah, bud. I'd hate For
this to turn out to Be a w

08:43.374 --> 08:44.686
Revenge !

08:45.275 --> 08:48.457
I must have revenge
Against my enemies !

08:50.111 --> 08:51.562
The turtles !

08:57.443 --> 08:58.755
Whoa !
What's that ?

08:58.955 --> 09:00.564
Whatever it is,
It's big and it's mean.

09:00.778 --> 09:02.353
And it's definitely
Ticked off !

09:09.705 --> 09:11.046
Turtles, scatter !

09:23.293 --> 09:24.786
Where'd that thing
Come from ?

09:30.499 --> 09:33.291
They've escaped,
But shredder won't !

09:33.647 --> 09:36.767
He's the one responsible
For what happened to me !

09:37.673 --> 09:42.932
I'm like mondo confused. Where'd that
humongous Insect come from, anyway ?

09:43.304 --> 09:46.767
Beats me, but there Was something
familiar About that creature,

09:47.239 --> 09:49.419
Like we've met him
Someplace before.

09:49.686 --> 09:51.218
Probably in the bughouse !

09:51.513 --> 09:54.653
And i can't shake The feeling that
it's got Something to do with shredder.

09:55.097 --> 09:59.811
Forget shredder. We've Got to track
down that Gazai leaf and fast !

10:00.251 --> 10:02.151
This time we'll take
The turtle blend.

10:02.825 --> 10:06.238
Primo notion !
My feet are killing me !

10:10.358 --> 10:12.280
It's no use, boss.

10:12.949 --> 10:16.611
How are we gonna Find this
fly guy In a burg this size ?

10:17.156 --> 10:18.732
If it really is baxter,

10:19.044 --> 10:22.304
He'll be looking for us
As well, you mutant moron !

10:22.883 --> 10:26.953
That's right,
Mutant moron !

10:29.605 --> 10:31.900
I think we found him,
Boss.

10:35.257 --> 10:37.893
That's baxter ! Bring
him down, You fools !

10:44.526 --> 10:46.535
Why are you
Attacking me ?

10:46.815 --> 10:48.548
Why are you
Attacking me ?!

10:48.777 --> 10:50.417
I thought
We were friends !

10:51.807 --> 10:52.999
Some friend !

10:53.307 --> 10:55.385
You always liked
These mutants better.

10:55.708 --> 10:59.845
Besides, it's your fault That i'm
this hideous, Hairy-legged monster.

11:00.794 --> 11:04.989
No, no. It was all The turtles'
fault, Don't you remember ?

11:05.473 --> 11:08.500
The turtles ?
But i thought--

11:08.813 --> 11:10.856
The turtles sent you back
To dimension x.

11:11.218 --> 11:12.889
<i>they are the enemy.</i>

11:13.212 --> 11:14.866
That's right.

11:15.347 --> 11:18.079
We used to fight
The turtles together.

11:18.405 --> 11:20.545
And together we will
Fight them again.

11:21.074 --> 11:23.896
Find them, and you
Shall have your revenge !

11:25.879 --> 11:27.099
Rest, my child.

11:31.061 --> 11:32.057
Yes ?

11:32.264 --> 11:33.303
Master splinter,

11:33.554 --> 11:34.996
We have a lead on
The gazai leaf.

11:35.459 --> 11:37.489
If april does not receive
The antidote soon,

11:37.906 --> 11:40.076
I fear it may be too late.

11:50.868 --> 11:54.317
Oh, whoa ! Man,
Dig that dampness !

11:54.664 --> 11:58.216
Mmm, yeah, Just like the
aquarium I was born in.

11:58.515 --> 12:01.730
A gazai plant Exactly like
the one In splinter's book !

12:02.199 --> 12:04.086
Outstanding !

12:04.723 --> 12:06.601
You are mo

12:07.066 --> 12:10.432
That is last remaining Gazai
plant in western Hemisphere.

12:11.151 --> 12:13.614
Well, say good-bye
To your gazai.

12:16.328 --> 12:18.393
I don't think he
Gave us the right change.

12:18.606 --> 12:20.012
I'm a few pennies short.

12:20.384 --> 12:24.192
That figures. I've Always said
you didn't Have enough "cents."

12:24.555 --> 12:26.084
Let's rock, dudes.

12:26.474 --> 12:28.543
The turtles !
I've found them !

12:29.495 --> 12:32.824
They shall pay dearly
For what they've done !

12:33.566 --> 12:36.641
Is this where you
Want me to stand, boss ?

12:37.065 --> 12:39.705
Exactly.
Ju

12:41.834 --> 12:43.161
Wha--hey, boss !

12:44.382 --> 12:45.906
Uhh ! What
Are you doing ?!

12:46.974 --> 12:48.404
W--uhh ! Boss !

12:53.302 --> 12:56.487
Not a bad test
If i do say so myself.

12:56.831 --> 13:00.136
I passed a test.

13:00.854 --> 13:02.832
What is that thing,
Boss ?

13:03.740 --> 13:07.285
One of baxter's last Inventions
before his Unfortunate, uh...

13:07.487 --> 13:08.355
Accident.

13:08.593 --> 13:10.057
I think i'll name it
After you.

13:10.775 --> 13:12.584
Gee, thanks, boss.

13:13.066 --> 13:14.906
I'll call it
The knucklehead.

13:17.955 --> 13:19.496
I found them, master.

13:19.948 --> 13:22.039
Excellent, baxter !
Where are you ?

13:22.301 --> 13:24.927
I'm not sure...

13:25.461 --> 13:27.995
But there's A great pizza
parlor On the corner.

13:28.295 --> 13:31.210
Well, that narrows
It down, you bug-brain !

13:31.443 --> 13:33.815
Never mind. I can hone in
On your signal.

13:33.815 --> 13:36.561
Just stay there and don't
Let the turtles get away !

13:38.167 --> 13:39.936
Cut him down
And let's go.

13:40.154 --> 13:42.494
This time,
Those turtles are mine !

13:43.571 --> 13:44.710
Ah ! There it is !

13:45.954 --> 13:48.716
Don't look now, Fellas, but
i think We've been spotted.

13:49.187 --> 13:50.555
In fact,
I'm sure of it !

13:50.917 --> 13:52.652
It's that fly again !

13:53.860 --> 13:55.065
Head for the blimp !

13:56.419 --> 13:59.071
There's never a crossing
Guard when you need one.

13:59.401 --> 14:02.364
Hey, pedestrians
Have the right of way !

14:02.880 --> 14:05.486
Pedestrians, yes !
Amphibians, no !

14:05.966 --> 14:07.358
Shred-head !

14:09.539 --> 14:12.164
I knew that doku plant
Would lure you here.

14:13.007 --> 14:15.689
Your sentimental side
Will be the finish of you !

14:15.967 --> 14:17.528
I'll handle this one,
Guys.

14:17.806 --> 14:19.649
Turtle power !

14:22.879 --> 14:24.969
The bow is mightier
Than the blaster.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.795
Come, my robot beast.

14:27.025 --> 14:28.454
I have a job for you.

14:30.879 --> 14:32.190
What's going on ?!

14:32.644 --> 14:36.047
"step into my parlor," Said
the knucklehead To the fly.

14:37.780 --> 14:40.052
Quick, we've got to
Help donatello !

14:40.882 --> 14:44.016
For sure ! The dude's
Up to his shell in trouble !

14:44.440 --> 14:46.377
Ready for
The second surprise ?

14:46.807 --> 14:48.371
Rocksteady ! Bebop !

14:49.356 --> 14:50.850
Here we are, boss.

14:51.081 --> 14:53.238
Ready to shoot
And loot !

14:54.581 --> 14:56.635
Say good-bye, turtles.

15:01.034 --> 15:04.155
Oh, you cretins !
Now look what you've done !

15:04.436 --> 15:06.845
We didn't know
He was gonna do that.

15:07.136 --> 15:10.274
We don't even know
What "cretins" means.

15:11.430 --> 15:14.972
Oh, thanks, leonardo.
That was a real tight squeeze.

15:15.309 --> 15:17.745
Don't mention it.
Time to move, turtles.

15:18.147 --> 15:19.897
April, here we come.

15:20.830 --> 15:24.064
Not quite,
My fellow mutants !

15:28.420 --> 15:29.130
No !

15:29.355 --> 15:31.797
Hang on !
We're gonna crash !

15:43.987 --> 15:46.152
Real smooth landing,
Leonardo.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.023
We've got company.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.800
Now, turtles, Prepare
to become History !

15:53.161 --> 15:55.123
We can't have a battle
In this place !

15:55.354 --> 15:57.028
It's a famous landmark.

15:57.382 --> 16:00.289
Yeah. Shredder And those
goons will Really trash it.

16:00.565 --> 16:04.000
Some villains have No
appreciation for Fine architecture,

16:04.531 --> 16:06.087
But there's one chance.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.925
We've got to get back
Aboard the blimp.

16:15.517 --> 16:16.742
After them !

16:22.732 --> 16:25.061
They're getting away !
Stop them !

16:26.180 --> 16:29.227
Oh, man. We're like
Sitting turtles Up here.

16:29.227 --> 16:31.609
Whose bright idea
Was this, anyway ?

16:32.050 --> 16:33.266
Yours.

16:33.578 --> 16:35.436
Well, you don't
Have to rub it in.

16:35.651 --> 16:38.145
I've got an idea.
Hang on, guys !

16:43.809 --> 16:45.135
The gazai plant !

16:47.226 --> 16:50.088
Idiots ! How could you
Let them get away ?!

16:51.379 --> 16:53.526
Look ! The turtles
Dropped this !

16:54.606 --> 16:58.659
Aha ! The only thing That can
revive o'neill And i have it !

16:59.131 --> 17:03.666
Hey, man, like, Why is this
thing making Those weird sounds ?

17:03.886 --> 17:05.935
'Cause we're running
Out of gas, naturally.

17:06.146 --> 17:08.521
Better put on Our turtle
trouper Shoe packs !

17:09.568 --> 17:12.730
Geronimo !
Cowabunga !

17:16.104 --> 17:19.535
We tried, master,
But we failed.

17:19.898 --> 17:23.478
We had the gazai plant,
But then along came shredder.

17:23.762 --> 17:26.885
Face it, dudes.
We blew it.

17:27.128 --> 17:30.830
Yeah. And poor, Innocent april
is The one who has to pay.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.089
Not quite,
My young turtles.

17:33.306 --> 17:36.193
The battle is never over
Until it is over.

17:36.473 --> 17:39.129
Splinter's right. We'll
find shredder And that plant

17:39.424 --> 17:41.220
If we have to comb every
Inch of this city.

17:41.705 --> 17:46.036
Attention, turtles. I
patched into Your frequency

17:46.369 --> 17:48.801
To extend an invitation.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.799
Forget it, shredder.
We're in no mood to party.

17:52.260 --> 17:55.605
Yeah. Unless, of course,
There's plenty of pizza.

17:55.949 --> 17:59.536
I hold in my hand the key
To april o'neill's survival.

17:59.848 --> 18:02.074
You'll need it
If you wish to save her.

18:02.307 --> 18:07.096
And to do that, you'll have To meet
me and my faithful Followers in battle.

18:07.424 --> 18:09.311
No tricks, no fancy weapons,

18:09.646 --> 18:12.513
Just four against four,
Ninja style,

18:12.790 --> 18:13.979
To the finish !

18:14.321 --> 18:15.853
Why, that dirty rat !

18:16.274 --> 18:18.656
Oh, sorry, master splinter.

18:18.955 --> 18:20.997
An understandable error.

18:22.135 --> 18:25.537
I can't wait. We can Whip
those turkeys In a fair fight.

18:26.051 --> 18:28.750
Fair ? That slimeball will
Probably use everything

18:29.031 --> 18:31.231
From flamethrowers
To nuclear warheads.

18:31.510 --> 18:35.303
You're right, raphael, But i have
an idea how To even things up.

18:38.297 --> 18:41.472
That's it ! Make sure You
cover those Electrodes !

18:41.888 --> 18:44.225
Are you certain
This will work ?

18:44.543 --> 18:47.391
Yes ! It will shift
The molecular structure

18:47.672 --> 18:49.333
Of anyone who
Steps between them

18:49.659 --> 18:52.137
A micro-second forward
In time.

18:52.734 --> 18:56.424
Thus rendering them Permanently out
of phase With the rest of the world.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.934
Perfect ! All we must do
Is lure the turtles into it

19:00.378 --> 19:01.829
And they'll vanish forever !

19:05.660 --> 19:07.328
Nice place shredder chose.

19:07.671 --> 19:09.955
A junkyard really fits
His personality.

19:10.329 --> 19:13.241
Exactamundo !
Cesspool city !

19:13.638 --> 19:15.893
Hey, where is
Old tin-skin, anyway ?

19:17.188 --> 19:18.061
There !

19:18.344 --> 19:19.683
Ah ! Turtles,
You're

19:20.201 --> 19:24.460
Come and get it...
Or are you afraid ?

19:25.145 --> 19:26.678
Us, afraid ?

19:27.275 --> 19:28.717
We welcome a fair fight !

19:28.936 --> 19:30.747
Then you've come to
The right place, my friends !

19:31.151 --> 19:32.251
Now !

19:41.621 --> 19:44.789
I hate to say it,
Turtles, but fall back !

19:45.581 --> 19:48.096
That's it.
Just a little farther.

19:49.312 --> 19:51.541
Hey, we're being herded
Toward something.

19:51.837 --> 19:55.098
Yeah, but what ? Oh,
I hate surprises like this.

20:01.071 --> 20:02.166
What ?!

20:05.080 --> 20:07.549
All right !
Fantastic !

20:08.154 --> 20:09.388
Way to go, splinter !

20:09.654 --> 20:11.694
Master, i thought You
didn't know How to drive !

20:11.914 --> 20:15.600
It's remarkable What one can
do When one is forced to.

20:24.161 --> 20:25.582
Well, what do you know ?

20:26.273 --> 20:27.981
Baxter, get that plant !

20:28.558 --> 20:30.060
Yes, master.

20:32.505 --> 20:34.412
Help meeeeeee !

20:35.390 --> 20:38.079
Oh, blast !
Time to retreat !

20:38.746 --> 20:41.305
Hey, wait for us !

20:42.645 --> 20:45.004
Awesome shooting,
Master splinter.

20:45.380 --> 20:48.308
Especially for someone Who
doesn't believe In violence.

20:48.778 --> 20:54.486
Now to add it
To the potion.

20:55.300 --> 20:57.017
Oh, it's just
Got to work !

21:03.399 --> 21:05.670
Oh, hi, guys.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.216
It worked !
Terrific !

21:09.699 --> 21:11.884
I--i must have fainted.

21:12.444 --> 21:14.625
I hope i didn't
Cause you any trouble.

21:14.876 --> 21:16.888
Nothing we couldn't
Handle, april.

21:18.261 --> 21:20.493
What's that
Strange odor ?

21:20.979 --> 21:23.709
I hope it's not
Another doku plant.

21:24.099 --> 21:27.376
It's a new flavor
Pizza i just invented--

21:27.714 --> 21:30.961
Anchovies smothered In
gazai leaves ! Ha ha ha ha !

21:31.338 --> 21:33.782
No !

21:34.691 --> 21:35.609
Gross !
Get it away !

21:35.827 --> 21:37.044
Yeah, i was hoping
You'd say that.

21:37.262 --> 21:38.821
Leaves more for me !

21:39.200 --> 21:42.052
Here's gazai in your eye !
