Oh, no. You're not
doing this again.

01:14.909 --> 01:16.744
What do you mean?
Of course I am.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.580
Stan wanted us to take him
to the pumpkin patch.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.041
Sharon, you know

01:22.208 --> 01:24.293

opened like an hour ago

01:56.992 --> 01:57.785
and 'member how
I was saying

01:57.952 --> 01:59.370
I want to get there early?

02:00.996 --> 02:02.331
Great. Perfect. Let's go
to the pumpkin patch.

Yup! Almost ready.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.918

02:06.085 --> 02:07.628
Okay, spider
or the bat?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.130
The spider's great.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.006
Really? 'Cause I think
I like the bat.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.675
Why does she
do this every time?

02:12.842 --> 02:14.135
- What, babe?

02:14.301 --> 02:16.762

Ooooh.

04:41.407 --> 04:42.825
I mean it!

04:42.992 --> 04:45.119
I got this spell book
last month.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.204
Got it in
Salem, Massachusetts.

04:47.371 --> 04:51.542
- They say it's real.
- Like, real how?

04:51.709 --> 04:54.545
Like from the devil himself.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.882
You guys want to try it?

04:59.049 --> 05:00.718
- Yeah. -Yeah.

05:07.725 --> 05:12.813
Hey!
Wait up, babe.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.398
Hey, where

Oh, boy! What
a great time that was!

05:16.900 --> 05:17.985
Thanks for coming,
kids.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.611
Oh, you just

05:19.778 --> 05:21.155
Yes, we are
just getting here.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.449
Okay, go on in, I suppose.
Petting Zoo's closed,

05:23.615 --> 05:25.826
and I think they stopped
the churro machine.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.620
The Petting Zoo's cl--
The Petting Zoo is closed?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.748

do the bouncy house.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.645
Ah!
Oh, it burns!

05:53.812 --> 05:55.272
Okay, Chip.

05:55.439 --> 05:56.440
You might need to ease up
on the crack there, buddy.

06:17.795 --> 06:19.463
I'll kill you all!

06:19.630 --> 06:22.257
Kill you all!

06:37.648 --> 06:41.151
You'll all be dead
by Halloween!

06:44.196 --> 06:46.240
Get out!
Everyone out!

06:46.407 --> 06:47.783
What do you mean?!
I just got here!

06:47.950 --> 06:49.201
There's a witch!

06:52.413 --> 06:53.539
Come on, Eric!

06:53.705 --> 06:56.125
No! I missed it!
I missed it all!

07:15.519 --> 07:17.938
Oh, hey.
Didn't see you there.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.942
Did you hear <i>anything</i>
about what happened last night?

07:22.109 --> 07:24.153
Uh...no.
What Happened?

07:24.319 --> 07:25.779
Your buddy, Chip Duncan?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.198
Apparently he flew around
on a broom,

07:28.365 --> 07:30.284
blew things up
and kidnapped some children.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.952
Are you serious?!

07:32.119 --> 07:33.579
You heard nothing
about this?!

07:33.745 --> 07:36.248
He flew away vowing we'd
all be dead by Halloween.

07:36.415 --> 07:39.001
God, I knew that guy
was a fucking chode.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.378
Randy, what did you guys do
at that party?

07:41.545 --> 07:42.963
Nothin'.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.965
We were just hangin' out
and talkin' and stuff,

07:45.132 --> 07:46.758
and then Chip
got all weird.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.177
People were hurt!

07:48.343 --> 07:50.971
Yeah, I agree --
it's awful!

07:51.138 --> 07:54.391
We're not like Chip, okay?
He's a bad witch!

07:57.394 --> 07:58.979
Did any of you guys
actually see the witch?!

07:59.146 --> 08:00.314
Yeah, it was
terrifying.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.065
She had a broom
and a cackle and everything.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.734
What are we
gonna do, guys?

08:03.901 --> 08:05.736
Our parents are never
gonna let us trick-or-treat

08:05.903 --> 08:07.112
with a witch
flying around!

08:07.279 --> 08:08.780
They say she blew up
the pumpkin patch.

08:08.947 --> 08:09.907
Did any of you guys
see that?

08:10.073 --> 08:11.575
No, I missed
the whole thing.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.243
I always try to get to the
pumpkin patch really early.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.411
Yeah, I got there
early, too.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.121
You get the best pumpkins
that way.

08:16.288 --> 08:18.665
Anyways, I guess the witch
destroyed the whole thing.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.417
We got to take matters into our own hands.
None of us are safe.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.377
Yeah, but what
are we gonna do?

08:22.544 --> 08:24.379
No, we got to just hope
the police will handle it.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.173
Yeah right, like they'll
handle anything.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.801
Stan's right.
This might fall on us.

08:29.968 --> 08:33.055
Yeah, we got to
save Halloween.

08:33.222 --> 08:34.389
Don't you
think so, Eric?

08:34.556 --> 08:35.807
What?

08:35.974 --> 08:38.310
We got to do something
to get rid of her!

08:38.477 --> 08:40.854
Yes.
You're right, guys.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.105
It's my only way out.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.446
All right. See you, Sharon.
Have a good night!

08:49.613 --> 08:51.782
Where do you think
<i>you're</i> going?

08:51.949 --> 08:53.283
What do you mean?

08:53.450 --> 08:54.743
It's day two of Witch Week
with the guys.

08:54.910 --> 08:58.622
You can't possibly be
considering doing this again!

08:58.789 --> 08:59.915
Why not?

09:00.082 --> 09:04.211
Randy a real witch is flying around in the
sky snatching children!

09:04.378 --> 09:05.587
I don't think
this is the best time

09:05.754 --> 09:08.173
for you to be wearing
a witch costume and partying.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.301
Ugh. Gah! Just because
of one bad witch,

09:11.468 --> 09:13.262
we're supposed
to stop a tradition

09:13.428 --> 09:14.846
that goes back
twenty-some-odd years?!

09:15.013 --> 09:17.391
Jesus!

09:20.435 --> 09:21.353
Hey, Randy.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.230
'Sup, guys?

09:23.397 --> 09:24.606
You know, just getting
a bunch of shit

09:24.773 --> 09:25.816
for being witches.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.276
I know, right?!

09:27.442 --> 09:29.278
It's like there's
one awful witch

09:29.444 --> 09:30.404
who wants
to kill everybody,

09:30.571 --> 09:32.030
so now they're coming after
all of us!

09:32.197 --> 09:34.241
This is like
a witch...thingie.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.660
It's like a witch
pursuit thingie!

09:36.827 --> 09:38.203
A witch...uh...

09:38.370 --> 09:40.289
It's a witch
chase and shoot 'em up!

09:40.455 --> 09:42.207
Yeah, that's
what it is!

09:49.631 --> 09:51.675
Hey, what the hell
is this?

09:51.842 --> 09:54.678
Park closed
until further notice.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.597
That's bullshit!

09:56.763 --> 09:58.265
Oh, my God!

09:58.432 --> 09:59.850
They can't do this.

10:00.017 --> 10:03.520
The whole town really is
on a witch pursuit thing.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.210
Check this out,
you guys.

10:27.419 --> 10:28.587
It says that
to destroy a witch,

10:28.754 --> 10:31.340
you need bent pits,
nine in all,

10:31.506 --> 10:33.175
each bent into an "L" shape.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.843
What are bent pits?

10:35.010 --> 10:36.094
Hey, guys!
I think I got it figured out!

10:36.261 --> 10:37.804
You do?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.556
I knew Eric would come up
with a plan!

10:41.767 --> 10:43.727
Okay, first of all,
we need a scary place

10:43.894 --> 10:45.020
to lure her into.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.647
What is the creepiest place
in town?

10:46.813 --> 10:48.565
Ross Dress for Less.
That's right.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.150
Stan and Kyle will wait inside
the Ross Dress for Less

10:50.317 --> 10:51.610
and I will
bring Heidi there.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.070
Once inside,
Kenny and Butters

10:53.236 --> 10:55.072
will set off a series
of explosions that will --

10:55.238 --> 10:56.657
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What the fuck
are you talking about?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.909
This is how we're going
to get rid of Heidi.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.786
Nobody's talking about
getting rid of Heidi!

11:00.952 --> 11:02.829
You guys said you would help me
get rid of her!

11:02.996 --> 11:03.997
Of the witch!

11:04.164 --> 11:05.415
Who cares about a witch?!

11:05.582 --> 11:07.250
My life is a living hell,
you guys!

11:07.417 --> 11:08.960
Then break up with her!

11:09.127 --> 11:11.380
You clearly can't stand her.
Let the poor girl go!

11:11.546 --> 11:13.423
I've tried!
It's impossible!

11:13.590 --> 11:16.259
Heidi's a nice girl.
How can you be so awful to her?!

11:16.426 --> 11:19.680
You don't understand. She has no
time-management skills whatsoever.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.432
You don't know 'cause you've
never had a girlfriend, Kyle!

11:24.142 --> 11:26.186
Fine.
Just leave me to suffer.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.813
Next time you want me
to kill someone for you,

11:27.979 --> 11:29.731
just forget about it.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.111
Students and parents,

11:34.277 --> 11:36.488
I know that you are
all concerned about the witch

11:36.655 --> 11:38.323
who is preying upon our town.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.908
And I want to speak to you all

11:40.075 --> 11:42.077
about how to try
and protect yourselves.

11:42.244 --> 11:43.912
But first,

11:44.079 --> 11:46.415
some gentlemen
have asked to speak

11:46.581 --> 11:50.085
on what they perceive to be
a "witch pursuit thing."

11:52.170 --> 11:53.714
Oh, wait, I'm supposed
to be actually over --

11:53.880 --> 11:55.132
Yeah, you go over
there, Stewart.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.634
Right. Right.
Right. Right.

11:57.801 --> 12:01.680
♪ We're all
on the same side, you and I ♪

12:01.847 --> 12:06.268
♪ Let's all stick togetha,
let's try ♪

12:06.435 --> 12:08.019
♪ When things are going bad ♪

12:08.186 --> 12:10.897
♪ And there's people
you need to confront ♪

12:11.064 --> 12:15.944
♪ Just be sure it doesn't turn
into a witch pursuit thing ♪

12:16.111 --> 12:19.614
Hey, guys. There's good witches
and there's bad witches.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.491
And we stand with you

12:21.658 --> 12:25.162
in saying this particular witch
needs to be brought down.

12:25.328 --> 12:28.498
But that doesn't mean
we should all be closing parks

12:28.665 --> 12:31.877
And stopping
all witch activity because --

12:32.043 --> 12:35.547
♪ Let's not turn this
into a witch pursuit thing ♪

12:35.714 --> 12:36.923
Dad, get outta here!

12:37.090 --> 12:39.468
We're trying to deal
with an actual witch.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.261
Nobody's coming after you!

12:41.428 --> 12:43.054
Yes, they are, boys!

12:43.221 --> 12:45.599
And next
they'll be coming after you!

12:45.766 --> 12:48.059
'Cause you're all
little sons a witches.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.811
Right,
you don't have to worry

12:49.978 --> 12:51.646
about us going around
snatching children.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.899
Only the other witch
does that.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.614
- Hey, babe.
- Oh, hey, Eric.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.365
Listen, there's a big fun
costume party tonight

13:02.532 --> 13:04.326
and I was thinking
you and me should go.

13:04.493 --> 13:05.076
What do you say?

13:05.243 --> 13:08.038
A costume party?
With everything that's going on?

13:08.205 --> 13:10.207
Yeah, I just think, you know,
we need to let off some steam

13:10.373 --> 13:11.917
and have a little Halloween fun,
you know?

13:12.083 --> 13:13.752
I already have our costumes
picked out.

13:13.919 --> 13:15.796
Well...I guess.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.547
Cool, I'll come pick you up
at 5:00!

13:17.714 --> 13:19.758
Well, maybe make it 4:30
if you're bringing the costumes.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.551
I might need a little extra time
to get ready.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.304
Oh, I'm counting on it.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.185
Randy, can I talk to you?

13:30.352 --> 13:31.978
Sure, Stephen.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.731
I've been doing
a lot of thinking, Randy.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.818
About the past.
About what we've done.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.569
I think
it's time we come clean

13:39.736 --> 13:41.196
and tell everyone
about the crack.

13:41.363 --> 13:44.324
And the spells
against our wives.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.034
Okay, look,
you're freaked out.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.577
It's understandable.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.746
I have to admit
what I've done wrong, Randy!

13:49.913 --> 13:51.832
I feel like
everything's crashing down

13:51.998 --> 13:54.167
and I want Linda to hear it
from me first.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.836
Okay, we smoked
a little crack --

13:56.002 --> 13:57.754
we put harmless spells
on our wives.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.381
We were
just messing around.

13:59.548 --> 14:00.590
It was harmless fun!

14:00.757 --> 14:02.384
Was it?

14:02.551 --> 14:04.636
Or did we close our eyes to
what Chip Duncan was becoming?

14:04.803 --> 14:07.055
Stephen, you can't turn
on your own kind.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.432
That's what these
witch pursuit thingies do, okay?

14:09.599 --> 14:11.142
They make everyone go crazy.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.686
I'm sorry, Randy.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.230
I have to clear
my conscience.

14:15.397 --> 14:18.692
All right, Stephen.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.443
At least give us
till tomorrow morning

14:20.610 --> 14:22.654
to talk to our wives
and prepare them, all right?

14:22.821 --> 14:24.155
Can you just give us
till morning?

14:24.322 --> 14:27.200
Yeah, sure.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.326
I'm sorry.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.287
It's okay. It's okay.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.668
Hey, it's Randy.

14:36.835 --> 14:37.836
We've got until
tomorrow morning

14:38.003 --> 14:39.713
to sacrifice Stephen
to the devil.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.048
I'll explain later,
just get everyone together.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.551
And maybe bring
just a little bit of crack.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.642
Don't you think we should stay
on the main roads, Eric?

14:52.809 --> 14:54.811
This seems like
a bad place to be right now.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.022
Don't worry Heidi, this is
the fastest way to the party.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.441
I'm sure the witch
won't even notice us!

15:00.984 --> 15:02.652
Eric, come on,
this is a bad idea.

15:02.819 --> 15:03.862
Let's turn around.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.530
Well, Heidi,
if we'd been on <i>time</i>

15:05.697 --> 15:07.198
we wouldn't need
to take a short cut,

15:07.365 --> 15:09.409
but I wanted to give you
your space to get ready.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.244
Is that
what this is about?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.913
You're still mad about
the pumpkin patch, aren't you?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.331
Why would I be mad?

15:14.497 --> 15:16.082
You wanted to make sure
you looked right

15:16.249 --> 15:18.043
and then had to eat
and use the bathroom 40 times.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.086
I can't blame <i>you</i> for missing
the pumpkin patch.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.297
I didn't use the bathroom
40 times!

15:25.884 --> 15:26.801
What was that!?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.222
Eric! Did you hear that?!

15:31.389 --> 15:32.724
Eric?!

15:32.891 --> 15:34.100
Eric!

15:34.267 --> 15:36.770
Oh, my God!
Eric, are you okay?!

15:38.939 --> 15:42.317
Well, well,
what have we here?

15:42.484 --> 15:45.862
Sweet. Come on...
Come on...

15:48.448 --> 15:49.783
Dude, is your dad home?

15:49.950 --> 15:51.326
No.
I don't know where he is.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.078
We can't find our dads
either!

15:53.244 --> 15:55.538
Yeah, and it turns out
our dads and the bad witch

15:55.705 --> 15:58.249
were all part of the same witch group!
- We asked our moms,

15:58.416 --> 15:59.668
and they said this has been
going on for years.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.170
We gotta find them before
something even stupider happens.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.631
- How are we gonna do that?!
- There's another guy.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.299
Someone else who was
in the witch's club

16:06.466 --> 16:08.093
but hasn't been around for a while.
- Who?

16:13.515 --> 16:15.308
Mr. President,

16:15.475 --> 16:17.477
you have an urgent call
from a Butters Stotch.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.398
Butters?
What's he want?

16:21.564 --> 16:23.149
This is the President.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.819
Oh, uh, hello,
Mr. President, how are you?

16:25.986 --> 16:27.487
Butter him up,
Butters.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.198
How -- How is running
the country goin'?

16:30.365 --> 16:33.326
Oh, it's fine. You know, just
making the country great again.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.412
Did you get rid of all
the immigrants like you said?

16:35.578 --> 16:37.497
I got rid of, like,
six of 'em so far...

16:37.664 --> 16:39.708
You know it's little harder
than I thought.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.377
Cool, and did you build that
big wall you were gonna build?

16:42.544 --> 16:43.920
Don't be a dick, Butters.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.006
Are you just calling
to shit on my Halloween?

16:46.172 --> 16:49.134
No, sir!
I -- Well, the thing is --

16:49.300 --> 16:51.302
Didn't you used to do J and C
Witch Week with our dads?

16:51.469 --> 16:53.555
Yeah, it was
my favorite time of year.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.516
Now I just have to
celebrate it alone.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.809
Well, the thing is,
Mr. President,

16:57.976 --> 16:59.561
one of the guys did a spell

16:59.728 --> 17:01.187
and took a bunch of children
and he's gonna eat 'em all.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.356
Lemme guess --
Chip Duncan.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.734
Oh, that guy
was always such a douche.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.193
Mr. President,
please, you gotta help.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.154
Our dads can't do anything
'cause they're scared

17:09.320 --> 17:10.822
people are coming
after <i>all</i> witches.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.490
Coming after <i>all</i> witches?!

17:12.657 --> 17:14.993
Oh, geez...

17:20.665 --> 17:22.417
So you were there
when witch showed up

17:22.584 --> 17:23.710
and took your girlfriend?

17:23.877 --> 17:25.420
Yes, it just came
outta nowhere.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.505
I tried to save Heidi,
but it was too late.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.215
What was your girlfriend
wearing?

17:29.382 --> 17:30.717
She was dressed kinda like me

17:30.884 --> 17:32.427
but had a simple
Munich dirndl from Germany.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.179
And you didn't stop at all

17:34.345 --> 17:36.556
to think that what you were
doing might attract the witch?

17:36.723 --> 17:38.349
Excuse me?

17:38.516 --> 17:39.851
Are you actually trying
to blame the victim here?!

17:40.018 --> 17:42.520
I'm just saying that if
there's a big fat witch around,

17:42.687 --> 17:44.189
maybe you shouldn't
walk through the woods

17:44.355 --> 17:45.106
dressed
as Hansel and Gretel.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.566
Ohhh!

17:46.733 --> 17:48.318
Whoa, whoa. Not cool, Rick.
Not cool!

17:48.485 --> 17:49.778
I will have your badge, sir!

17:49.944 --> 17:51.321
Sorry, folks, sorry.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.074
Detective! Detective!
Call just came in.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.659
The witch has been spotted
at Ross Dress for Less!

17:56.826 --> 17:58.870
Everyone to
Ross Dress for Less now!

18:04.250 --> 18:06.920
Guys?
I'm here...

18:07.087 --> 18:08.755
Guys?

18:08.922 --> 18:10.173
What's this all about?

18:10.340 --> 18:13.218
Hello, Stephen.

18:13.384 --> 18:16.554
Oh, hey.
What are we meeting here for?

18:16.721 --> 18:20.141
It's too late, Stephen.
We called the police.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.227
We know
you took those children.

18:22.393 --> 18:25.355
What?!
What -- What are you doing?

18:25.522 --> 18:26.856
Here he is, everybody!

18:27.023 --> 18:29.317
Stephen's a bad witch!

18:29.484 --> 18:32.612
No!

18:32.779 --> 18:34.989
We're putting a stop to you,
Stephen!

18:35.156 --> 18:37.575
Because that's
what good witches do!

18:37.742 --> 18:40.870
Oh, my God.
I see what this is.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.957
This witch pursuit thing has <i>you</i>
on a witch pursuit thing now!

18:47.210 --> 18:48.962
I'm innocent! Please!

18:49.129 --> 18:50.588
It's over, Stotch!

18:50.755 --> 18:51.923
What have you done
with the children?

18:52.090 --> 18:53.716
No, don't you see?!

18:53.883 --> 18:55.927
They're just doing their own
witch pursuit thingy now.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.137
This is madness!

19:06.563 --> 19:08.356
Hey, wassup, bros?

19:08.523 --> 19:10.233
"Wassup bros"?!

19:10.400 --> 19:12.819
Chip, do you see
all the chaos you've caused?

19:12.986 --> 19:15.155
Yeah, so? I'm a witch.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.073
You understand

19:17.240 --> 19:19.659
everyone associates us
with you, right?

19:19.826 --> 19:22.829
Of course they do.
You're all witches too, dudes!

19:22.996 --> 19:24.581
Not like you!

19:24.747 --> 19:26.166
What'd you do
with the children?

19:26.332 --> 19:28.293
They're all in here!
See?

19:28.459 --> 19:30.753
Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!

19:30.920 --> 19:34.549
I'm going to use their souls
to increase my power!

19:36.217 --> 19:38.845
Look! Another witch
is flying down now!

19:43.516 --> 19:45.852
Butters, come on!
We got to go!

19:46.019 --> 19:47.729
Okay! Where?

19:47.896 --> 19:49.814
I guess our witches were gonna
sacrifice your witch,

19:49.981 --> 19:51.816
but then the bad witch showed up and now
the witch we called just arrived!

19:51.983 --> 19:54.861
- There's witches everywhere!
- Holy moly!

19:55.028 --> 19:57.989
Look, Chip, if we had known
you were gonna hurt people

19:58.156 --> 19:59.490
we would have
never even hung out.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.911
- Oh, gimme a break, Randy.
- No, seriously.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.829
Like if one of <i>you</i> guys
had the power I have

20:04.996 --> 20:05.872
you wouldn't use it.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.624
No we wouldn't!

20:07.790 --> 20:09.667
Excuse me -- Chip what
the fuck are you doing?

20:09.834 --> 20:11.419
Oh, hey, man!

20:11.586 --> 20:13.254
You're ruining the party
for everyone, Chip,

20:13.421 --> 20:14.464
I'm here to take you out.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.550
You'll never stop me!

20:17.717 --> 20:20.303
I grow more powerful
every moment!

20:20.470 --> 20:22.472
You wanna see <i>real</i> power?

20:22.639 --> 20:24.057
All right, take the shot.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.377
Okay! Just a second!

20:54.671 --> 20:58.258
Okay! Almost ready.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.927
It's gonna be a while.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.762

El Presidente.

All ready
to trick or treat?!

21:26.160 --> 21:28.830
Yeah, no, I've been ready
for a couple hours now.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.165
Cool, I just wanna put on
some lip gloss.

21:31.332 --> 21:32.834
Do these stockings go
with this outfit?

21:33.001 --> 21:35.003
I thought maybe
I should use the red ones...

21:35.169 --> 21:36.629
Is it cold out?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.339
You think I should put
a hoodie on over this?

21:38.506 --> 21:40.967
Nah, covers up my costume
too much, don't you think?

21:41.134 --> 21:42.510
Okay, all ready.

21:42.677 --> 21:45.221
Oh, wait! Hang on.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.473
I can't decide if I should
wear leggings or not.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.475
Is it gonna be cold?
Should I just --
