00:03.311 --> 00:05.431
Previously...
Ruby, please, just give me a minute.

00:05.431 --> 00:08.911
I'm sorry, but I need to restock the
Ondansetron. Where's the drugs bag?
It's not there.

00:08.911 --> 00:12.111
What are you doing, young man? Eh?
Casing the joint for a robbery,
are we?

00:12.111 --> 00:14.471
Iain, do you have a drug problem?

00:14.471 --> 00:17.031
Are you kidding me?
Is that why you messed up with Mia?

00:17.031 --> 00:20.231
Rash, are you trying to tell me
that me you're a virgin?

00:20.231 --> 00:21.311
SHE LAUGHS

00:21.311 --> 00:23.511
Oh, you are?! Ha-ha!

00:23.511 --> 00:25.151
You - you were here earlier.

00:25.151 --> 00:27.351
I know your son Jacob.

00:27.351 --> 00:29.151
My Jacob?

00:29.151 --> 00:30.431
He's my dad.

00:32.431 --> 00:34.271
When was the last time you saw him?

00:34.271 --> 00:36.791
You didn't tell him that we're
meeting today?!

00:36.791 --> 00:39.591
No. I didn't tell him.

00:39.591 --> 00:40.591
This is ours.

00:52.751 --> 00:54.311
PASSENGERS LAUGH

00:56.591 --> 00:58.431
Can I get two singles?

00:58.431 --> 00:59.551
Thanks.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.591
ETHEREAL VOICE: Omo...

01:12.591 --> 01:15.191
Leave me alone!

01:15.191 --> 01:18.271
Are you OK? Omo...

01:18.271 --> 01:20.791
Omo. Omo!

01:58.031 --> 02:00.791
Elle? Morning. Have you heard from
Blake today?

02:00.791 --> 02:05.271
I'm fine, thank you very much for
asking, Jacob. He's 17,
I'm his mother

02:05.271 --> 02:09.151
and it's five to ten in the morning.
Of course I haven't heard from him.
He should be working on

02:09.151 --> 02:12.511
his applications, but he was out
all day yesterday, and out early
again this morning.

02:12.511 --> 02:14.791
Early? That's a miracle! Now he's
not answering his phone.

02:14.791 --> 02:17.031
Not as easy as it looks, is it?

02:17.031 --> 02:18.671
It's not a joke! I'm worried.

02:18.671 --> 02:21.671
He needs to start thinking
about his future,

02:21.671 --> 02:25.391
or he's going to end up coming out
of college with nowhere to go.
He's going to mess about

02:25.391 --> 02:28.831
until the last minute then miss the
boat! I know that for a fact cos
he's exactly like me.

02:28.831 --> 02:32.311
He could do really well. Jacob! I
can't believe I'm going to say
this - cut him some slack.

02:32.311 --> 02:36.231
He has months to do his
applications, whereas I now
have four minutes to get coffee

02:36.231 --> 02:38.791
before the shift from hell starts.
So go away!

02:41.431 --> 02:44.271
Oh, wow, Oscar!
Please tell me they're for me. No.

02:46.071 --> 02:47.111
Aw!

02:49.031 --> 02:50.991
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

02:52.031 --> 02:56.551
ETHEREAL VOICE: Omo... Hey! Omo.

02:56.551 --> 03:01.511
VOICES: That person with her.
Disgusting. Poor guy. Omo...

03:02.351 --> 03:06.031
I'm going to call Dad, OK?
No! You can't call him.

03:06.031 --> 03:09.031
Promise me you won't call him! OK.
It's OK.

03:09.031 --> 03:12.911
VOICE: He's calling him.
OMO SHOUTS: Don't you dare call him!

03:12.911 --> 03:15.791
Excuse me, I think we need
to call the police. Is she OK?

03:15.791 --> 03:17.991
Does she need any help?
No, no, no, thank you.

03:20.231 --> 03:22.831
Omo, the bus is going to stop in a
bit and we can get off, OK?

03:25.751 --> 03:26.751
Excuse me.

03:31.991 --> 03:33.671
All right, mate, can you hear me?

03:37.631 --> 03:39.351
He's not breathing.
There's no pulse.

03:39.351 --> 03:41.031
Cardiac arrest.

03:41.031 --> 03:42.551
Iain, I, I, I... I think he's gone.

03:42.551 --> 03:44.471
It's an overdose.
It's a reversible cause.

03:44.471 --> 03:45.631
Pads please.

03:54.751 --> 03:56.951
OK, asystole. No shock.

03:56.951 --> 03:58.591
You get back on the chest.

03:58.591 --> 04:00.031
Um...

04:00.031 --> 04:01.431
Ruby - compressions!

04:05.431 --> 04:08.271
27, 28, 29, 30.

04:08.271 --> 04:10.031
I'll get back on compressions.

04:10.031 --> 04:11.471
Get a line in, please.

04:11.471 --> 04:12.871
VOICE: Omo.

04:12.871 --> 04:14.471
Omo!

04:14.471 --> 04:16.791
Omo. Omo... Omo!

04:16.791 --> 04:18.311
VOICE: They're talking about you.

04:18.311 --> 04:20.111

VOICE: What's wrong with Blake?

04:21.751 --> 04:23.711
Are you OK? You're not hurt?

04:23.711 --> 04:25.671
No, I, I... I'm fine.
What about you though?

04:25.671 --> 04:27.231
I'm sick to my stomach!

04:28.311 --> 04:29.671
I feel sick.

04:29.671 --> 04:32.431
VOICE: I can't believe you're
doing this to him.

04:32.431 --> 04:34.431
VOICE: He wants to get you off to
see Jacob.

04:34.431 --> 04:35.791
No!

04:35.791 --> 04:37.631
Not Jacob. No...

04:37.631 --> 04:39.231
I... I feel sick.

04:39.231 --> 04:42.751
VOICE: It's your medication -
again, again, again, again.

04:42.751 --> 04:45.031
We're going to get off now.

His veins have completely collapsed.

05:03.231 --> 05:05.631
We need access now! Get the IO gun.

05:07.271 --> 05:08.271

Naloxone in...and flush.

05:47.031 --> 05:49.031
Look, Iain, he's not responding
to anything.

05:49.031 --> 05:50.711
His gear must've been cut
with something.

05:50.711 --> 05:53.111
There's been a few ODs recently
with doses of Fentanyl.

05:53.111 --> 05:54.271
Did they survive?

05:56.551 --> 05:58.871
You should take it, I really think
you're going to need it.

05:58.871 --> 06:01.271
I really, really don't.

06:01.271 --> 06:02.911

No problem - good luck!

06:06.711 --> 06:10.031
OK, my dear - so if you can just
get on the bed for me, please.

OMO SHOUTS: Let me go!

06:12.271 --> 06:14.711
Nothing is wrong with me!

06:14.711 --> 06:16.911
Excuse me. This is a hospital.

06:16.911 --> 06:21.431
There isn't a scratch on me.
Look, not a scratch!

This is a hospital.

06:36.671 --> 06:38.231
I've got this.

06:47.431 --> 06:48.831
Hey.

06:48.831 --> 06:49.871
Hey!

06:51.991 --> 06:53.711
What the hell is this?

06:55.191 --> 06:56.271
But...

07:01.351 --> 07:03.271
OK, thanks.

07:03.271 --> 07:04.471
One more adrenaline.

07:05.471 --> 07:06.911
Iain... Adrenaline.

07:06.911 --> 07:08.751
The arrest was unwitnessed.

07:08.751 --> 07:11.831
There was an unknown no-flow
time before starting CPR.

07:11.831 --> 07:14.471
There's still a chance. He's had no
output for at least 20 minutes,

07:14.471 --> 07:15.951
I think probably more like
an hour...

07:15.951 --> 07:17.431
Just pass me the adrenaline!

07:17.431 --> 07:21.191
Iain, he's gone.
He was gone before we arrived.

07:21.191 --> 07:26.231
Look, they say there's going to be a
delay in removing the body, so...

07:26.391 --> 07:29.271
Right. Well, we're not leaving him
here. Get him on the van.

07:29.271 --> 07:31.311
At least make it look like
there's a chance.

07:31.311 --> 07:32.311
OK.

07:36.151 --> 07:39.391

07:41.431 --> 07:43.471
There is nothing wrong with me.

Not in my heart.

07:53.031 --> 07:56.751
Auntie, the police brought you here
because they were worried about you.

07:56.751 --> 07:59.311
But this is a safe place,

07:59.311 --> 08:01.991
where we can wait for the
psychiatrist to assess you.

08:05.911 --> 08:07.791
Have I seen you before?

08:07.791 --> 08:10.711
Yes, I'm Jacob's friend.

08:10.711 --> 08:13.351
Now, you were prescribed Olanzapine.

08:13.351 --> 08:15.351
Have you been taking it?

08:15.351 --> 08:18.071
Would you like me to get you some
now, to help you relax?

08:20.151 --> 08:21.671
I have said...

08:21.671 --> 08:25.351
..there is nothing wrong with me!

08:28.991 --> 08:31.431
Thank you.
I'll be back in a minute.

08:31.431 --> 08:33.511
Nothing wrong with me.
VOICE: Omo!

08:33.511 --> 08:35.391
I'm trying!

08:35.391 --> 08:37.911
Can we at least get her to somewhere
more quiet? Louise is on it.

08:37.911 --> 08:40.751
Once HDU is clear, I'll move her in
there. What did Blake say?

08:40.751 --> 08:42.551
He disappeared as soon as
he came in.

08:42.551 --> 08:45.071
Why am I not surprised?
I'll find him.

08:45.071 --> 08:46.871
Elle...

08:46.871 --> 08:48.111
Thank you.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.951
OK, so I'll just let them know
that we're bringing the body in

09:11.951 --> 09:15.071

risking your career and the use of
your fingers.

11:53.351 --> 11:55.031
Not to mention my career.

disorientated

helping.

Jacob...

How long has she been ill? I don't
know exactly. I was young.

13:43.191 --> 13:45.031
In the first few years I never had a
name for it -

13:45.031 --> 13:47.271
so I never told anyone. That's just
how it stayed.

13:47.271 --> 13:49.831
INCREDULOUSLY: All that time...!
ALL that time?!

13:49.831 --> 13:51.591
Yeah, well. We survived.

13:51.591 --> 13:53.671
Why do you think I spent all
those nights at yours?

13:58.151 --> 14:02.431
I've asked Louise to prepare the
Lorazepam and Haloperidol.
No, no, no.

14:02.431 --> 14:04.271
Jacob, we are on a knife-edge here!

14:04.271 --> 14:07.191
The number of times that she's
spent... Look, the number of times

14:07.191 --> 14:10.231
that she's been sedated without her
consent and it wasn't necessary...

14:10.231 --> 14:15.231
NO. She just needs a quiet space
where she can feel safe. OK?

14:15.231 --> 14:18.311
Yes, yes. OK.

14:31.591 --> 14:33.791
Ade, Ade!

14:35.711 --> 14:37.271
Come on, Ade. Don't mess about.

14:38.871 --> 14:39.871
I'm not.

14:39.871 --> 14:41.671
I don't want to come home.

14:41.671 --> 14:44.351
Why would I? Come on, mate,
where you going to go?

14:44.351 --> 14:46.991
CAR HORN

14:46.991 --> 14:48.231
Yeah, all right.

14:54.591 --> 14:57.351
Ade?

15:02.951 --> 15:04.631
Ade!

15:04.631 --> 15:07.271
Ade! Dad.

15:07.271 --> 15:08.831
Dad! Ade!

15:13.751 --> 15:15.791
Are you OK? What happened?

15:18.671 --> 15:19.871
Come on.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.471
Jacob, the HDU cubicle's free.

15:38.511 --> 15:40.351
Thanks, Lou. I'll get Elle.

15:40.351 --> 15:41.831
She's tied up in Resus.

15:42.831 --> 15:43.951
HE SIGHS

15:43.951 --> 15:46.471
Is there someone else that can
move her? We're really busy.

15:46.471 --> 15:49.151
I can get a porter, but if we're
not quick we're going to lose it.

15:51.391 --> 15:53.471
No, it's fine. OK.

16:03.431 --> 16:04.591
Louise, er...

16:08.591 --> 16:09.591
Hi, Mum.

16:13.951 --> 16:15.671
Come on, mate, talk to us.

16:27.431 --> 16:30.791
CAR HORN BLARES

16:30.791 --> 16:32.431
Come on, come on!

16:34.471 --> 16:36.431
There's a face I used to know.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.591
A lot thinner now, though.

16:42.151 --> 16:45.271
So - is it you?

16:45.271 --> 16:46.351
Yeah.

16:47.431 --> 16:49.271
Yeah, Mum. It's me.

16:49.271 --> 16:50.511
Oh...

16:50.511 --> 16:52.511
So you are the one keeping me here?!

16:52.511 --> 16:54.551
No. Mum...

16:54.551 --> 16:57.191
Mum, the doctors just want to make
sure that you're OK, all right?

16:57.191 --> 17:00.231
We're just going to take you
somewhere a bit more comfortable.
No need.

17:00.231 --> 17:01.271
I'm not staying.

17:02.791 --> 17:04.311
I know you.

17:04.311 --> 17:05.951
You're going to lock me up!

17:05.951 --> 17:08.071
Mum, we just want to help you...

17:08.071 --> 17:11.111
Give me that!
You think you can take that?

17:11.111 --> 17:13.311
You stealing from me?!
Mum, I'm just trying to help!

17:14.671 --> 17:16.271
There you are.

17:16.271 --> 17:17.911
Out.

17:17.911 --> 17:21.351
He's trying to take me.
They've given me a sickness.

17:21.351 --> 17:24.831
We are just trying to take you
somewhere quieter.

17:24.831 --> 17:26.831
It is, um...

17:26.831 --> 17:28.111
It is really noisy in here.

17:29.271 --> 17:31.111
There's way too many people, right?

17:33.151 --> 17:35.151
Can I come with you?

17:35.151 --> 17:38.031
I'm going where you're going.

17:38.031 --> 17:39.831
Still have two legs - see?

17:39.831 --> 17:41.311
I can walk! OK.

17:46.351 --> 17:47.351
This way.

17:55.391 --> 17:58.471
Look, I didn't say anything before,
but I really can't continue

17:58.471 --> 18:00.151
to cover for you.
I could lose my job.

18:03.151 --> 18:05.751
What actually happened to
the drugs bag?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.271
Not this again.

18:07.271 --> 18:09.831
Is someone you know an addict?
No!

18:09.831 --> 18:11.111
Well, what is it?

18:13.991 --> 18:15.791
Whoa!

18:15.791 --> 18:17.551
Was he asleep?

18:17.551 --> 18:19.071
I don't know. Call it in.

18:19.071 --> 18:21.431
This is 1087 to Control.
TYRES SCREECH

18:21.431 --> 18:25.511
We're diverting to an ongoing
incident on the A4401.

18:25.511 --> 18:27.191
Dad! Car out of control. Dad!

18:27.191 --> 18:31.951
Male semi-conscious at the wheel,
doing approximately 40mph, over.

18:31.951 --> 18:33.711
What on earth is he doing?!
SIRENS

18:33.711 --> 18:34.751
RADIO: Copy that, over.

18:34.751 --> 18:39.831
SIRENS

18:40.831 --> 18:44.071
Do you reckon you could you get in
front of him? Get Control on.

18:44.071 --> 18:47.071
This is 1087 to Control.

18:47.071 --> 18:50.551
Help!

18:50.551 --> 18:52.551
Yeah, I'm going to try and slow this
vehicle down.

18:52.551 --> 18:53.791
There's a police car behind me.

18:53.791 --> 18:56.831
Can you ask it to pull up alongside
while I bring it to a halt, yeah?

18:56.831 --> 18:58.831
RADIO: OK, great.
Thanks for the update.

18:58.831 --> 19:03.351
SIRENS

19:09.631 --> 19:11.671
Whoa, there's traffic coming up!

19:13.871 --> 19:14.951
LOUD SMASH

19:36.991 --> 19:40.031
Iain, that was incredible! You OK?

19:49.431 --> 19:50.711
Are you OK?

19:52.711 --> 19:54.271
Can you hear me, sir?

20:04.071 --> 20:07.711
Hi, I... No! No, not her.

20:07.711 --> 20:10.191
It's OK. She's my mum.

20:13.831 --> 20:15.311
I, um...

20:15.311 --> 20:18.511
I have to go for a minute, but she's
going to look after you.

20:18.511 --> 20:23.031
Auntie, I'm going to give you
something to help with the nausea.

20:23.031 --> 20:24.671
SHE GASPS LOUDLY

20:24.671 --> 20:27.311
Remember when you were feeling sick
on the bus?

20:27.311 --> 20:28.671
I'm feeling sick.

20:28.671 --> 20:30.471
This will make the sickness go away.

20:31.911 --> 20:34.351
I said I'd seen you before.

20:34.351 --> 20:37.151
She... She your mother?
She a good doctor?

20:37.151 --> 20:38.951
Yeah, really good.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.071
The best.

20:42.071 --> 20:43.471
Well, then.

20:43.471 --> 20:44.471
She's fine.

20:45.671 --> 20:46.751
Thank you.

20:48.631 --> 20:50.191
SHE INHALES SHARPLY
Sorry, sorry.

20:51.391 --> 20:53.831
ETHEREAL VOICE: Omo...

20:53.831 --> 20:56.991
She's fine.

20:56.991 --> 20:59.191
Omo...

20:59.191 --> 21:00.351
She's fine!

21:01.711 --> 21:03.791
So, er, what were you two
doing today?

21:03.791 --> 21:05.991
Um... There was a food festival.

21:05.991 --> 21:08.071
Oh, we missed it!

21:08.071 --> 21:10.751
It's all right.
I was full up on chips anyway.

21:10.751 --> 21:13.591
Oh, chips, huh? I see!

21:15.831 --> 21:17.831
We're nearly there.

21:20.431 --> 21:21.911
QUIETLY: Thank you.

21:21.911 --> 21:25.191
GENTLY: So, Auntie, all done, OK?

21:25.191 --> 21:27.311
I will be back to check on you
very soon -

21:27.311 --> 21:29.791
but I'd really like for you
to get some rest.

21:39.591 --> 21:42.111
I could stay with her,
so she's not on her own. No.

21:42.111 --> 21:44.071
She needs to rest, OK?

21:47.471 --> 21:49.111
Jacob, if we...

21:49.111 --> 21:51.391
Sorry to interrupt,
we've got an RTC coming in.

21:51.391 --> 21:53.751
Can I get some help in Resus?
Yeah, of course.

21:53.751 --> 21:54.791
Jacob.

21:56.031 --> 21:58.631
He's good with her. If he hadn't
started playing happy families

21:58.631 --> 22:00.471
then she wouldn't be here
in the first place.

22:04.671 --> 22:06.951
Hey. Two incoming?

22:06.951 --> 22:09.391
Yeah. Um... Ruby phoned ahead,

22:09.391 --> 22:12.631
apparently Iain drove them off the
road and avoided a major RTC.

22:12.631 --> 22:16.111
Seriously?! Yeah. Well, it's all
happening today, isn't it?

22:18.151 --> 22:20.391
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

22:20.391 --> 22:22.151
OK, do you want to take
the first one?

22:22.151 --> 22:24.591
Yes. All right, Iain,
what have we got?

22:24.591 --> 22:27.871
This is Ade Terrant,
11 years old, he was a back-seat

22:27.871 --> 22:31.791
passenger involved in a low impact
RTC at approximately midday.

22:31.791 --> 22:34.191
He wasn't wearing a seat belt
because he took over the wheel

22:34.191 --> 22:36.831
from his dad who was unconscious.
Ruby's just bringing him in now.

22:36.831 --> 22:39.271
Hi, Ade. I'm Alicia,
I'm one of the doctors.

22:39.271 --> 22:41.511
That's it, get yourself across,
mate. Well done.

22:41.511 --> 22:45.591
Resps 22, Sats 98% on air, pulse 90.

22:45.591 --> 22:50.631
BP 105 over 60. GCS 14.
BM 2, but that went up to 5.4

22:50.671 --> 22:52.831
with 40% glucose gel.

22:52.831 --> 22:56.351
There's no apparent injuries apart
from this bruise on his forehead

22:56.351 --> 22:59.351
and we've cleared his neck at the
scene, all right? Brilliant.
Thank you.

22:59.351 --> 23:01.391
Well done, Ade.

23:01.391 --> 23:05.231
Well, sounds like you had
a lucky escape, eh?

23:05.231 --> 23:08.111
We're going to check you over and
run some tests, all right?

23:08.111 --> 23:09.591
This is Paul Terrant, he's 38...

23:09.591 --> 23:12.151
I'll have a listen to your chest.
Take some deep breaths for me.

23:12.151 --> 23:13.471
..prior to the RTC.

23:14.991 --> 23:19.951
His Resps are 18, Sats are 97,
pulse is 102.

23:21.991 --> 23:25.391
Can you sit back for me,
then look straight ahead?

23:25.391 --> 23:27.231
..he's got no apparent injuries.

23:27.231 --> 23:29.031
Are we ready on my count? Yeah.

23:29.031 --> 23:30.991
Right. Three, two, one, lift.

23:30.991 --> 23:34.111
They look dilated.
Have you got any pain in your head?

23:34.111 --> 23:37.431
Do you feel dizzy, or sick? Yeah.

23:37.431 --> 23:41.151
And were you feeling sick
before you got in the car?

23:41.151 --> 23:44.791
No. OK. It looks like you might
have a bit of concussion,

23:44.791 --> 23:47.711
so Jacob here is going to keep
an eye on you.

23:47.711 --> 23:51.191
Can I get a full set of bloods and a
venous blood gas while we're waiting

23:51.191 --> 23:54.431
for the lab, plus an ECG, and some
regular neuro obs.

23:54.431 --> 23:56.591
I'll be back to check on you
in a bit, all right?

23:59.711 --> 24:02.511
Do you want me to find someone else
so that you can be with your mum?

24:02.511 --> 24:04.191
No. I'm fine.

24:08.431 --> 24:11.271
Can I get a triple chocolate
cappuccino with whipped cream

24:11.271 --> 24:13.111
and a flake, please? Thank you.

24:13.111 --> 24:14.471
Oh, and some crisps.

24:14.471 --> 24:17.951
Yikes, is it that bad? What?

24:17.951 --> 24:21.351
Are you OK? I heard you and Iain had
a bit of a prang.

24:21.351 --> 24:24.471
Oh, um... Technically, it wasn't a
prang at all.

24:24.471 --> 24:27.351
Iain actually did some
really excellent driving.

24:27.351 --> 24:31.391
Can I get a green tea whenever you
get a chance, please. Thank you.

24:31.391 --> 24:34.191
So, it's a bit awkward about the
whole room situation.

24:34.191 --> 24:37.111
How do you mean?
Well, I drew the short straw.

24:37.111 --> 24:40.391
But I was kind of hoping that Rash
could stay over, you know?

24:40.391 --> 24:42.951
Because my room only has a
single bed in it.

24:42.951 --> 24:45.071
Sorry, do you not like
sleeping in a single bed?

24:45.071 --> 24:46.831
Well, it's a bit uncomfortable
for two.

24:46.831 --> 24:49.671
You don't suppose you'd think about
switching rooms with me, would you?

24:49.671 --> 24:52.111
Oh... Right, yeah.

24:52.111 --> 24:53.711
What, you will? Yeah, yeah, sure.

24:53.711 --> 24:55.791
I mean, I'm not bothered about the
room, it's fine.

24:55.791 --> 24:57.791
Oh, amazing! Thank you so much.

24:57.791 --> 24:59.031
What's going on?

24:59.031 --> 25:01.471
Ah, here he is - Superman himself!

25:01.471 --> 25:02.671
I've got a date!

25:07.791 --> 25:09.311
So have we.

25:09.311 --> 25:11.031
Jan wants to see us back at
the station.

25:16.071 --> 25:19.311
OK, let's get you further up
the bed.

25:19.311 --> 25:21.151
Here, under his shoulder.

25:21.151 --> 25:23.351
It's all right, mate. I'm fine.

25:24.991 --> 25:28.071
Hi, Paul. Good.

25:28.071 --> 25:29.991
You're looking a bit better.

25:31.751 --> 25:34.511
We're still trying to establish
exactly what happened in the car.

25:34.511 --> 25:36.591
Do you know if you've been ill
like that before?

25:36.591 --> 25:39.311
No, nothing like this before, no.
It came on really quickly.

25:39.311 --> 25:43.271
I was on my way here with Ade.
I felt a bit dizzy,

25:43.271 --> 25:46.351
and then... I can't remember
anything else.

25:46.351 --> 25:48.791
I'm sorry,
you were on your way here?

25:48.791 --> 25:51.431
Yeah - for Ade. It's just that
Ade said he was feeling fine

25:51.431 --> 25:53.231
before he got in the car. What?

25:53.231 --> 25:56.671
You collapsed! I was driving him
to hospital.

25:56.671 --> 25:59.751
OK, so you fell ill before you
got in the car?

26:01.991 --> 26:04.831
If you do know what's caused you to
be ill, especially if it's

26:04.831 --> 26:07.271
affected both of you, then we
really need to know.

26:09.871 --> 26:13.071
OK. We'll keep you in for a bit
longer, do some more tests.

26:13.071 --> 26:17.031
All right? Yeah, all right.
Let's get you back into bed, OK?

26:17.031 --> 26:19.671
I'll be back to check on you
in a sec.

26:19.671 --> 26:22.791
Can we run a Social Services
search for Ade, please? OK.

26:24.431 --> 26:27.151
Tonight?! What about the room?

26:27.151 --> 26:30.031
Room's sorted!
Obviously it's meant to be.

26:31.591 --> 26:32.991
What?

26:32.991 --> 26:36.111
It's just, I don't think things
are meant to be.

26:36.111 --> 26:38.551
We either make things happen or
they don't happen.

26:38.551 --> 26:40.791
Well, this is happening.

26:40.791 --> 26:44.471
What time do you finish -
half seven? Yeah, yeah.

26:44.471 --> 26:46.471
I'll see you, then.

26:46.471 --> 26:49.391
There she is -
Holby's favourite porter.

26:50.551 --> 26:52.991
Rash, are we still on for lunch?

26:52.991 --> 26:56.071
Yeah, yeah, um...
Do you want to join?

26:56.071 --> 26:58.231
Yeah, that'd be lovely.

26:58.231 --> 26:59.271
SHE RETCHES

27:01.711 --> 27:03.311
Sorry! Sorry!

27:03.311 --> 27:05.751
I am so sorry! Come on...

27:05.751 --> 27:08.151
Was that a friend of yours? No.

27:08.151 --> 27:10.231
My friends don't vomit on me.

27:10.231 --> 27:11.511
Gem, are you OK?

27:11.511 --> 27:13.071
Yeah, fine.

27:13.071 --> 27:15.271
I should just, um...

27:15.271 --> 27:17.151
Such a shame.

27:17.151 --> 27:18.951
I'll see you tonight though, yeah?
Yeah.

27:30.711 --> 27:33.431
So, big day.

27:33.431 --> 27:36.231
Either of you want to tell me what
you've been up to?

27:36.231 --> 27:40.471
I've come back from my leadership
day - fat waste of time that was -

27:40.471 --> 27:43.151
and I've got a missing window,
and I'm minus an RRV.

27:43.151 --> 27:45.991
Not to mention the hot-and-sticky
I've got dumped on my desk

27:45.991 --> 27:47.991
from Control.

27:47.991 --> 27:50.231
Let's start with the window.

27:50.231 --> 27:51.471
Right, yeah.

27:51.471 --> 27:53.631
This morning,
after we picked up the overdose...

27:53.631 --> 27:56.351
We were on scene dealing
with the arrest,

27:56.351 --> 27:58.791
and some idiot threw a
brick at the window.

27:58.791 --> 28:00.711
I've already reported it.

28:00.711 --> 28:02.031
And what about my car?

28:03.031 --> 28:06.311
You mean the accident with the RRV?

28:06.311 --> 28:08.511
Well, if Iain hadn't driven
into them...

28:08.511 --> 28:11.671
Yes! Massive congratulations
on the save.

28:11.671 --> 28:14.831
But now I'm two vehicles down,
and I really thought

28:14.831 --> 28:17.711
with everything that's happened
you'd want to keep a low profile.

28:17.711 --> 28:19.471
Plus, control have wet the bed,

28:19.471 --> 28:21.751
and I'm going to get a giant
headache from HQ!

28:21.751 --> 28:24.951
A father and his son could've died
today if it wasn't for the actions

28:24.951 --> 28:28.231
of your paramedic.
He risked his life, and mine,

28:28.231 --> 28:30.871
to avoid what could've been
a really serious incident

28:30.871 --> 28:32.391
with multiple fatalities.

28:32.391 --> 28:34.751
And you haven't even asked
him if he's OK,

28:34.751 --> 28:37.191
which I'm pretty sure is a breach
of your duty of care!

28:40.271 --> 28:41.551
Are you OK?

28:43.991 --> 28:45.111
Yeah, I am.

28:46.511 --> 28:47.751
Good!

28:50.271 --> 28:51.871
What've we got, then?

28:51.871 --> 28:55.031
OK, so, um... Ade's last review
with Social Services

28:55.031 --> 28:57.911
was on the 20th of August, 2016.

28:57.911 --> 29:01.151
Paul's got MS, but doesn't have an
official carer assigned.

29:01.151 --> 29:05.991
So...? So, it's pretty likely that
the care has fallen to Ade.

29:05.991 --> 29:09.951
What? He can't be more than 11!
They do come younger.

29:09.951 --> 29:12.511
We had a six-year-old that was
managing her mum's insulin

29:12.511 --> 29:15.191
but kept helping herself
to the dextrose.

29:15.191 --> 29:16.831
What about Ade, then?

29:16.831 --> 29:19.191
Why didn't he want to admit to being
ill before the crash?

29:20.591 --> 29:21.591
Take a look at this.

29:25.031 --> 29:27.791
Hey, Ade!
What're you doing out of bed?

29:27.791 --> 29:29.191
Just helping me dad.

29:31.191 --> 29:33.191
So, how you feeling?

29:33.191 --> 29:35.271
Yeah, much better, thanks. Good.

29:35.271 --> 29:37.791
I was looking through your notes
and saw your consultant

29:37.791 --> 29:40.591
prescribed Nabiximols - medicinal
cannabis - for your MS.

29:40.591 --> 29:43.791
Yeah... Are you still taking it?

29:43.791 --> 29:47.471
We moved and I couldn't get it
under the new trust. OK.

29:47.471 --> 29:49.711
So what do you do now?
I order it online.

29:49.711 --> 29:53.551
It's not ideal, but I want to keep
doing as much as I can, you know,

29:53.551 --> 29:55.351
and the oils help with the tremors.

29:55.351 --> 29:57.911
So, after today I probably don't
need to tell you that unlicensed

29:57.911 --> 30:00.791
cannabis isn't safe -
especially when you're driving.

30:00.791 --> 30:03.591
It can't have been that, though.
It doesn't have that effect on me.

30:03.591 --> 30:06.751
Plus, Ade had symptoms too,
we both had the same thing.

30:06.751 --> 30:11.431
It was a bug, or food poisoning...
Or whatever.

30:11.431 --> 30:13.431
It's OK, little man.

30:13.431 --> 30:16.551
You're not in trouble. What? Ade
wouldn't touch my medications!

30:16.551 --> 30:18.951
It's not medication though, is it?

30:18.951 --> 30:21.791
It's just cannabis,
like you'd buy from anywhere else!

30:26.031 --> 30:29.111
VOICE: Omo, Omo, Omo!

30:29.111 --> 30:30.911
Omo...

30:30.911 --> 30:33.151
Omo, Omo! Someone's coming in.

30:33.151 --> 30:34.151
SHE GASPS

30:36.031 --> 30:39.471
Mrs Masters, there's been a mistake
with your medication.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.271
SHE GASPS FEARFULLY

30:41.271 --> 30:44.271
She gave you the wrong bag, and it's
gone into your blood!

30:47.191 --> 30:50.831
What about the poison - the poison
still inside you?

30:54.951 --> 30:58.671
No, no... We're fine.

31:00.031 --> 31:02.031
But why? Why would you take it?

31:03.231 --> 31:05.671
Some of the kids at school
smoke weed to relax.

31:07.711 --> 31:10.671
I thought it'd help.
Help? With what?

31:10.671 --> 31:12.031
What do you think?!

31:12.031 --> 31:15.311
I do the cooking, I do the cleaning,
I help you get dressed,

31:15.311 --> 31:17.511
so I'm late for school every day!

31:17.511 --> 31:20.071
You can't even have a
bath without us!

31:20.071 --> 31:23.951
I'm tired all the time - and you
won't let anyone else in the house!

31:23.951 --> 31:25.391
Look...

31:25.391 --> 31:29.031
It seems things have been pretty
rough for both of you.

31:29.031 --> 31:31.471
But you know there are
people that can help.

31:31.471 --> 31:33.071
That bad, is it?

31:33.071 --> 31:35.631
Ade, how long have you been taking
the oils?

31:37.151 --> 31:38.551
A couple of months.

31:39.591 --> 31:42.231
Dad didn't know.
I should have, though.

31:42.231 --> 31:45.111
I'm afraid because you had an
accident whilst under the influence

31:45.111 --> 31:48.711
of drugs, we're going to have to
inform the police and
Social Services.

31:48.711 --> 31:51.831
But we will make sure they have
all the information, OK?

31:53.591 --> 31:55.831
Thank you. OK.

32:00.271 --> 32:03.351
VOICE: He did it deliberately -
to get you back.

32:03.351 --> 32:04.951
He was looking after me.

32:04.951 --> 32:07.831
That's what he SAID he was doing,
but you were a horrible,

32:07.831 --> 32:09.351
horrible mother!

32:09.351 --> 32:10.671
I don't remember!

32:12.831 --> 32:15.311
Why on earth would he look
after you,

32:15.311 --> 32:18.391
after everything you did to him?

32:18.391 --> 32:22.271
You deserve to die after everything
you put him through.

32:25.471 --> 32:27.311
You know what you need to do.

32:27.311 --> 32:28.951
The poison needs to come out.

32:33.311 --> 32:35.431
Dad...

32:35.431 --> 32:37.151
I'm sorry.

32:37.151 --> 32:40.311
What?
You've nothing to be sorry for.

32:44.031 --> 32:48.231
I should've noticed
how much you're doing.

32:48.231 --> 32:52.711
You know, it all just
sort of...crept up on me.

32:53.911 --> 32:55.351
I didn't want to ask for help.

32:58.791 --> 33:02.471
I thought it'd be best for both of
us if we stayed together.

33:02.471 --> 33:05.951
I think...

33:05.951 --> 33:08.151
..when we speak to
Social Services...

33:10.791 --> 33:13.351
..we should see if there's space
with a family.

33:13.351 --> 33:15.671
Not if we don't have to, though.

33:15.671 --> 33:18.511
We could just ask someone in
to come and help you.

33:18.511 --> 33:21.951
It's not forever. Just till I get
through this bad patch.

33:21.951 --> 33:25.471
You're going to make me leave?
You can't just send me away!

33:26.671 --> 33:31.591
Ade, you've been there for me
day and night.

33:31.591 --> 33:34.351
But now I need to make sure
someone's looking after YOU...

33:35.791 --> 33:37.991
..and I can't do that right now.

33:42.671 --> 33:45.351
Let's start by getting you
something to eat.

33:45.351 --> 33:46.951
Right, get us my wallet.

33:48.431 --> 33:50.591
Argh! Dad?

33:50.591 --> 33:51.991
I'm fine...

33:53.351 --> 33:55.031
HE SIGHS

33:55.031 --> 33:57.311
Get us a few packets of crisps.

33:57.311 --> 33:59.071
That's not very healthy.

33:59.071 --> 34:01.391
OK - a sandwich then.

34:01.391 --> 34:03.151
All right?
I'll see you in a minute.

34:07.431 --> 34:11.111
MACHINE STARTS TO BEEP

34:11.111 --> 34:12.111
HE CRIES OUT IN PAIN

34:16.391 --> 34:18.991
Hi, Duffy. Hi.

34:18.991 --> 34:22.311
Did you see the flowers?
Yeah, they're amazing! But no card?

34:22.311 --> 34:23.711
Oh, yes, there is.

34:25.951 --> 34:30.031
"A big thank you to the team
for treating Rachel." From Bill!

34:30.031 --> 34:31.631
Aw, they're gorgeous!

34:31.631 --> 34:34.271
He's an old flame of yours,
I understand.

34:34.271 --> 34:37.111
Oh! Someone's got an admirer!
Mm-hm. Duffy.

34:37.111 --> 34:38.951
Stop it, they're for the team!

34:38.951 --> 34:41.791
Oh, the team?! Is that what we're
calling it these days?

34:41.791 --> 34:43.791
"The team" has an admirer!

34:43.791 --> 34:46.271
THEY LAUGH

34:46.271 --> 34:48.071
Oh, if you're making one.

34:51.791 --> 34:54.791
How you doing? Yeah - fine.

34:56.431 --> 34:58.351
I was going to ask if, um...

34:58.351 --> 34:59.991
If you fancied a drink later?

35:01.511 --> 35:02.631
SHE SIGHS

35:02.631 --> 35:04.551
Look, I'd love to, but...

35:04.551 --> 35:07.591
Can we make it another night?
I just...

35:07.591 --> 35:11.471
I just want to curl up on the sofa
and watch some easy telly.

35:11.471 --> 35:13.471
Of course.

35:13.471 --> 35:15.111
Well, if you did want company,

35:15.111 --> 35:17.791
I see your night on the sofa,
and raise you a takeaway.

35:20.671 --> 35:21.791
That sounds good.

35:22.871 --> 35:26.071
Ethan, you're needed in Resus.
It's Paul Terrant.

35:33.791 --> 35:36.111
Ruby, you shouldn't have lied
about the window.

35:37.591 --> 35:39.871
The words you're looking for
are "thank you".

35:41.311 --> 35:42.951
Yeah. Cheers.

35:46.991 --> 35:49.431
Um... Look, Iain.

35:49.431 --> 35:52.471
Are you sure you don't need
some time off?

35:52.471 --> 35:55.151
No, no, no. Definitely not.

35:55.151 --> 36:00.191
OK. Just promise me you'll speak
to someone if you need to.

36:00.351 --> 36:01.511
Yeah.

36:01.511 --> 36:05.111
Like me, or a professional.

36:05.111 --> 36:06.711
Or Miss Trunchbull in there.

36:06.711 --> 36:08.791
Yeah, maybe not Jan.

36:10.351 --> 36:11.711
I appreciate it.

36:13.231 --> 36:15.231
It's no problem.

36:15.231 --> 36:16.471
See you later.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.871
There's nothing on the X-ray.

36:40.871 --> 36:44.071
BP's 90 over 58 and he's
tachy at 100.

36:44.071 --> 36:46.911
OK, let's get two more units
then, please.

36:46.911 --> 36:48.751
I can't see any sign of bleeding...
PAUL GROANS

36:48.751 --> 36:51.911
..but I'm going to do a primary
survey and make sure we haven't
missed anything.

36:51.911 --> 36:53.551
HE CRIES OUT IN PAIN

36:53.551 --> 36:55.991
He's got MS...and depression.

36:55.991 --> 36:58.511
Yeah, I'm really sorry, you can't be
in here at the moment.

36:58.511 --> 37:00.951
Sorry, kid. Let's go outside.

37:00.951 --> 37:05.791
He takes Prednisone, 60 milligrams a
day. Citalopram 40 milligrams...

37:06.031 --> 37:09.031
PAUL GROANS
..and Ibuprofen three times a day.

37:09.031 --> 37:10.511
OK, do you know how long for?

37:11.591 --> 37:16.631
Ibuprofen just a couple of months,
the others - like, years.

37:16.871 --> 37:20.031
Do you know if he was on any kind of
PPI - that's something like

37:20.031 --> 37:22.071
Lansoprazole or Omeprazole?

37:22.071 --> 37:26.711
Omeprazole - but he stopped taking
it, said it gave him a headache.

37:26.711 --> 37:28.991
All right.
Thank you, that's really helpful.

37:28.991 --> 37:32.431
We're looking at a long term NSAID
with no PPI - could be

37:32.431 --> 37:34.951
a peptic ulcer bleed, that wouldn't
show up on the X-ray.

37:34.951 --> 37:37.031
We need to get him in for an
emergency endoscopy.

37:37.031 --> 37:39.951
Can you let them know that we're
on our way, please?

37:39.951 --> 37:42.551
Let's get another two units, please.
Come on, let's go outside.

37:42.551 --> 37:46.231
I need to be with him. Look, there's
nothing you can do right now.
I don't want to leavehim!

37:46.231 --> 37:48.871
Come on, come on. Let's go, let's
go. You know, all that information

37:48.871 --> 37:51.471
you gave to the doctors now
was very impressive.

37:51.471 --> 37:53.751
And what you did in the car
this morning -

37:53.751 --> 37:55.871
you know, you probably
saved his life.

37:55.871 --> 37:56.991
Hey.

37:57.991 --> 38:00.831
They're looking after him, OK?

38:00.831 --> 38:02.871
Is there anyone we can call for you?

38:02.871 --> 38:04.511
Jacob, it's your mum.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.671
OMO: It's coming...

38:07.671 --> 38:10.431
OK, can you call the emergency
social worker for Ade? Yeah.

38:10.431 --> 38:12.871
I'll be back, OK? All right? Hello.

38:16.671 --> 38:20.751
It's coming out - it's coming out!

38:20.751 --> 38:22.791
VOICE: He's coming...

38:22.791 --> 38:25.231
He's angry, really angry with you!

38:25.231 --> 38:26.671
She's on his side.

38:26.671 --> 38:29.911
She always has been,
since they were little.

38:29.911 --> 38:33.151
You're NOT a doctor!
You were just a girl.

38:33.151 --> 38:35.191
He'll make you stay, to finish you.

38:35.191 --> 38:38.191
Mum? Can you blame him,
after everything you did?

38:38.191 --> 38:40.671
Mum, tell me what's going on.

38:40.671 --> 38:42.791
What are they saying?
VOICE: No - you can't tell him!

38:42.791 --> 38:44.431
It would be bad to tell him.

38:44.431 --> 38:46.751
You tried to kill me.

38:46.751 --> 38:50.311
You know I could never do that, Mum,
because I'm a nurse.

38:50.311 --> 38:53.151
VOICE: Omo...
I help make people better.

38:53.151 --> 38:54.471
And I'm your son.

38:54.471 --> 38:56.351
Omo...

38:56.351 --> 38:57.871
Can you show me your arm?

38:57.871 --> 38:59.551
Omo! Mum?

38:59.551 --> 39:00.631
Mum, look at ME!

39:00.631 --> 39:01.951
Look at me, Mum.

39:01.951 --> 39:04.111
VOICE: Omo...

39:04.111 --> 39:07.671
You know what those voices
are really saying?

39:07.671 --> 39:10.111
They're saying that you're afraid.

39:10.111 --> 39:13.351
They're saying this is a crowded
place and you don't feel safe,
and that's OK, Mum.

39:14.791 --> 39:16.431
Everybody gets scared.

39:18.551 --> 39:20.111
Are you scared, Mum?

39:22.511 --> 39:24.551
WHISPERS: Are you scared?

39:27.591 --> 39:31.711
So... Will you come with me back
to your cubicle?

39:31.711 --> 39:33.031
VOICE: He's getting closer.

39:33.031 --> 39:35.431
Then I can give you something to
help you relax. VOICE: Omo!

39:35.431 --> 39:37.311
He's coming...

39:37.311 --> 39:39.391
Mum. He's getting closer. Mum.
Omo, Omo..

39:39.391 --> 39:40.791
Mum! Mum, look at me!

39:40.791 --> 39:42.351
VOICE: Run, Omo, run!

39:44.631 --> 39:46.071
It's OK... I got this!

39:46.071 --> 39:48.311
Lorazepam and Haloperidol, please.

39:48.311 --> 39:50.351
Don't! Don't! It's OK, it's OK!

39:50.351 --> 39:52.711
Don't make me go in there...
SHE SOBS

39:52.711 --> 39:55.591
Auntie... They're going to kill me!

39:55.591 --> 39:58.311
Mum... They're going to kill me!

39:58.311 --> 39:59.911
Please... No!

39:59.911 --> 40:02.711
We're going to take you back
where it's quiet and safe...

OMO PROTESTS AND SOBS

This is your fault!

40:06.551 --> 40:09.911
You were always a greedy boy!

40:09.911 --> 40:12.791
You, you are a monster!

40:12.791 --> 40:14.991
A monster!

40:14.991 --> 40:16.791
Help me!

40:16.791 --> 40:20.031
Somebody help me!

40:20.031 --> 40:22.391
I wish that you had never been born.

40:22.391 --> 40:23.631
Louise!

40:23.631 --> 40:28.111
Help me! Somebody help!

40:28.111 --> 40:33.791
Help me, please! Help me!

40:33.791 --> 40:35.831
Help me, please!

40:35.831 --> 40:37.791
Somebody!

40:37.791 --> 40:39.271
Help!

40:39.271 --> 40:41.551
Help! Help!

40:41.551 --> 40:42.911
What did you do?

40:43.951 --> 40:47.831
SHE SOBS

40:58.191 --> 41:00.271
KNOCKING ON DOOR
It's open!

MUSIC PLAYING

41:01.831 --> 41:04.671
Hello? Gem?

41:04.671 --> 41:05.911
Up here.

41:05.911 --> 41:09.151
MUSIC CONTINUES

41:12.351 --> 41:16.191
# I'll be riding shotgun
underneath the hot sun

41:16.191 --> 41:18.631
# Feeling like a someone

41:20.751 --> 41:22.191
# I'll be riding shotgun... #

41:22.191 --> 41:25.591
Wow! You look, um...

41:25.591 --> 41:27.631
I got you these.

41:27.631 --> 41:29.791
Thanks.

41:29.791 --> 41:32.271
No-one's ever given me
flowers before.

41:33.551 --> 41:35.151
What type are they?

41:35.151 --> 41:37.191
Um... Red ones?

41:37.191 --> 41:39.031
Oh, right! Red ones.

41:39.031 --> 41:40.951
My favourite.

41:49.031 --> 41:50.351
If you'd let me stay with her,

41:50.351 --> 41:53.071
instead of just leaving her on her
own, she could have been fine.

41:53.071 --> 41:55.631
You think I really don't
want to see her?

41:55.631 --> 41:57.711
Well, it's a lot easier, isn't it,

41:57.711 --> 42:00.551
when you don't have to deal
with it any more.

42:01.751 --> 42:06.031
Blake, leaving home was the hardest
decision I ever had to make.

42:08.471 --> 42:10.511
OK. All right, yes -

42:10.511 --> 42:14.031
there was a time I did not
want to be alone with her.

42:14.031 --> 42:16.591
I was young, and I was
looking after her.

42:18.391 --> 42:20.791
It was complicated back then.

42:20.791 --> 42:22.751
When I grew late into my teens,

42:22.751 --> 42:25.111
I really wanted to help.

42:25.111 --> 42:27.711
I needed to know how she was doing.

42:27.711 --> 42:31.751
But by then, it seemed like she
really hated me.

42:31.751 --> 42:33.631
Why? I don't know.

42:36.391 --> 42:37.911
Doctors call it a trigger.

42:39.351 --> 42:41.791
She is convinced that
I'm going to hurt her.

42:43.791 --> 42:46.231
I couldn't keep putting
her through that.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.271
But that doesn't mean I
can't see her.

42:50.711 --> 42:55.111
There is no way you're putting her
through another day like today!

42:55.111 --> 42:57.271
Do you understand?

42:57.271 --> 43:01.871
Jacob? Sorry, there's a call
for you about Paul Terrant.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.511
Yeah. Thanks, Lou.

43:05.751 --> 43:07.391
We've finished anyway.

43:12.231 --> 43:15.791
Yeah. I can't believe we had to go
to two separate places.

43:15.791 --> 43:19.071
Like, sorry,
what's wrong with chana masala?

43:19.071 --> 43:22.151
What's wrong with fish and chips?
Chana masala?

RADIO PLAYS

43:25.871 --> 43:28.591
Ooh. Whose are those? Mmm!

43:28.591 --> 43:31.271
Either Gem or Ruby has themselves
a gentleman caller!

43:31.271 --> 43:36.231
'This is a mixture of one
third grit, one third...'

43:36.631 --> 43:38.671
Score for Gem! Indeed.

43:38.671 --> 43:40.271
'..one third leaf mould.'

43:40.271 --> 43:41.671
Hi! Hi. Hi.

43:52.471 --> 43:53.471
Hello, Ade.

43:54.991 --> 43:57.231
Has anyone spoken to you
about your dad?

43:58.791 --> 44:00.911
He had a stroke after the endoscopy.

44:03.111 --> 44:05.071
Will he have brain damage?

44:12.391 --> 44:16.591
It could take a while before we know
exactly how much it's going
to affect him.

44:16.591 --> 44:18.271
So he could be more disabled?

44:20.071 --> 44:23.351
He'd hate that.
He hates not being strong.

44:24.471 --> 44:27.391
At least you won't have to worry
about caring for him.

44:27.391 --> 44:30.631
I want to. But you know it's going
to be hard, right?

44:30.631 --> 44:31.991
Maybe even harder than before?

44:31.991 --> 44:36.151
It is hard, but that doesn't mean
that we don't have a good life.

44:38.791 --> 44:43.671
He looked after me when my mam died,
and I was only two,

44:43.671 --> 44:47.151
and I've been looking after him
since I was seven.

44:47.151 --> 44:49.551
We just need a little bit of help.

44:49.551 --> 44:52.391
We can get some carers in -
spread the load.

44:54.031 --> 44:57.111
And we'll need to make sure you get
lots of support as well.

44:57.111 --> 44:59.311
Like what? Like talk to your school.

45:00.311 --> 45:02.711
And we can make sure that you get
some time off to spend with

45:02.711 --> 45:06.191
kids who are doing the same
sort of thing as you.

45:06.191 --> 45:07.951
You're not on your own, OK?

45:11.431 --> 45:14.111
Is that your social worker?

45:14.111 --> 45:16.591
I need to talk to her for a minute

45:16.591 --> 45:19.831
and then she'll take you somewhere
you can get some rest, OK?

45:21.711 --> 45:23.191
My man.

45:33.391 --> 45:36.231
# Excuse me for a while

45:36.231 --> 45:39.991
# While I'm wide-eyed and I'm so
damn caught in the middle... #

45:42.991 --> 45:44.391
Are you OK?

45:44.391 --> 45:46.631
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

45:48.031 --> 45:49.311
Just a bit nervous.

45:49.311 --> 45:52.711
We don't have to,
if you don't want to... I do.

45:52.711 --> 45:54.351
I do want to.

45:58.511 --> 46:01.871
# And a lion

46:01.871 --> 46:05.751
# A lion roars at you... #

46:11.151 --> 46:12.671
Rash? Rash?

46:14.871 --> 46:17.511
Rash, what's wrong?
RASH RETCHES

46:17.511 --> 46:18.991
Rash, talk to me!

46:18.991 --> 46:21.191
I'm going to turn it up,
give them a bit of privacy.

46:21.191 --> 46:24.391
Rash, open the door! Are you all
right? Hang on, hang on.

46:24.391 --> 46:25.911
Rash, what's wrong?

46:25.911 --> 46:29.511
RASH COUGHS

46:29.511 --> 46:31.911
Nothing, nothing. I'm fine.

46:31.911 --> 46:34.031
You don't look fine! Are you ill?
No.

46:35.911 --> 46:39.311
Then what? What, is it me?
Do you not want to?

46:39.311 --> 46:42.551
No, no, no, I do.
You're lovely! OK? Trust me.

46:44.111 --> 46:45.391
Then what?

46:47.311 --> 46:50.831
If you can't be honest with me,
then why are we even here?

46:50.831 --> 46:53.431
Well, that's us done then, isn't it?

46:55.071 --> 46:57.911
Maybe we weren't actually
meant to be.

46:57.911 --> 46:59.231
Gem! Gem, don't say that!

47:01.191 --> 47:02.271
Gem!

DOOR SLAMS

47:16.831 --> 47:18.871
Jacob, Jacob.

47:22.511 --> 47:24.551
The Psych team are here.

47:27.791 --> 47:31.071
Um, I understand why you're
upset with Blake.

47:31.071 --> 47:32.871
But he's not you.

47:33.831 --> 47:36.591
If there's even a chance he could
have some sort of relationship

47:36.591 --> 47:38.671
with her, wouldn't that be good
for the both of them?

47:38.671 --> 47:42.831
After what happened today?
Blake didn't know what he was
dealing with before today.

47:42.831 --> 47:46.071
I know you're just trying
to protect her. And him.

47:50.151 --> 47:54.951
It's not for you to decide what kind
of relationship they should have.

47:54.951 --> 47:56.831
She's his grandmother.

47:56.831 --> 47:58.471
Please let him try again.
