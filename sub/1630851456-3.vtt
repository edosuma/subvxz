00:11.160 --> 00:13.400
To me, I guess, sleep was like death,

00:13.480 --> 00:14.960
because it was an escape.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.600
And when Dr. Wilbur woke me up,

00:18.680 --> 00:21.760
or forced the other
personalities to wake me up,

00:22.840 --> 00:24.280
it scared me to death,

00:25.080 --> 00:28.320
because I had no idea
where I was, what was going on

00:28.720 --> 00:31.080
and I just seen
all these people around me.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.600
In the state that I was in, I thought…

00:34.680 --> 00:37.280
I felt everyone in the world was like me.

William Milligan had been
charged with rape, kidnapping and robbery.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.840
Today, he was found not guilty
for reasons of insanity.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.560
[Kathy Preston] After the hearing,

02:01.640 --> 02:04.280
Billy was sent to
the Athens Mental Health Center

02:04.360 --> 02:05.880
in Athens, Ohio.

02:06.760 --> 02:11.440
[Bob Ruth] The Athens Mental Institution
was a minimum-security facility.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.560
There were no bars
on the windows down there.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.280
There were locked doors,

02:15.360 --> 02:18.840
but it was easy to get in and out
of the Athens Mental Institution.

02:18.920 --> 02:22.120
The reaction of the community
when Billy was sent there

02:22.200 --> 02:27.200
was a strange mixture of pride and fear.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.440
They were proud
because it meant that our place

02:35.520 --> 02:38.920
was respected to take care of a diagnosis

02:39.000 --> 02:41.240
that's very exotic and rare at the time.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.640
On the other hand,
given his history of assault,

02:44.720 --> 02:48.720
people were slightly afraid
that if they let him out too soon,

02:48.800 --> 02:51.480
there could be trouble
with local young women.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.720
[Billy Milligan]
I was sent to Athens on a court order

03:00.800 --> 03:05.240
because Athens is considered

03:05.320 --> 03:08.400
not only a think tank
and a learning center,

03:09.160 --> 03:13.720
but they had a specialist down there
named Dr. David Caul

03:14.480 --> 03:21.160
who is renowned in treating people
with my kind of illness.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.880
Our job is to take as intelligent a guess…

03:26.960 --> 03:29.240
Make no mistake about it,
that's what we do.

03:29.320 --> 03:34.520
Hopefully, it's a guess
born of knowledge, experience, background,

03:34.600 --> 03:38.920
including some hunches,
intuition, a lot of hard work,

03:39.000 --> 03:44.320
and you make the best guess
you possibly can make.

03:48.720 --> 03:54.000
[Milligan] His job was to restore me

03:54.080 --> 03:56.000
to a reality sense

03:56.080 --> 04:00.400
and to integrate me
back into the community.

04:00.480 --> 04:04.040
A working, productive citizen
and a taxpayer.

04:04.120 --> 04:09.200
Dr. Caul seemed to want to
treat him the same way Harding did,

04:09.280 --> 04:13.720
do art therapy and maybe
finally take some classes--

04:13.800 --> 04:16.560
and be able to
integrate back into society,

04:17.040 --> 04:19.520
or at least to integrate into society,

04:19.600 --> 04:21.880
because he never really was.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.080
When Billy first got there,

04:26.160 --> 04:28.760
he was easy to get along with

04:28.840 --> 04:30.560
and he was quite likable.

04:31.080 --> 04:34.760
His relationship with the staff
was interesting,

04:34.840 --> 04:38.840
because half of them
believed in the multiple personality thing

04:38.920 --> 04:41.200
and went along with that diagnosis,

04:41.280 --> 04:42.440
half of them didn't.

04:46.840 --> 04:50.920
He was not very interested
in what was happening with other people.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.880
He was only interested in him and his…
whatever his 'want' was of the day.

04:56.440 --> 05:00.120
He would become, you know,
pretty irritable when he was told no.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.120
Uh…

05:01.720 --> 05:05.840
Yeah, he could be a…
He was never an easy person to deal with.

05:10.400 --> 05:15.640
Dr. Caul wasn't a whole
100% board-certified psychiatrist.

05:17.200 --> 05:21.200
This is an individual who was
learning psychiatry in the hospital.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.680
He was not
formally trained as a psychiatrist,

05:23.760 --> 05:27.120
but it was like, "Okay,
people can take me seriously."

05:27.200 --> 05:29.720
"I have skills.
I have interest. I have whatever."

05:29.800 --> 05:32.040
And this was a platform for him.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.920
So, he had to be
supervised by someone who was,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.920
and this medical television system
connected with Columbus…

05:41.000 --> 05:45.600
He could get Dr. Walter Knopp
to sit in the background as it were

05:45.680 --> 05:47.560
and watch the conversation.

05:51.600 --> 05:56.840
I would be behind the camera
tweaking the waveform monitor

05:56.920 --> 05:59.040
and making sure everything was okay,

05:59.120 --> 06:02.320
then Dr. Caul would bring in the patients.

06:02.400 --> 06:07.520
And Billy was usually
a special consultation all by himself.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.560
They would sit down at a table
in front of the camera

06:10.640 --> 06:12.840
and he would hypnotize Billy.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.520
And they'd say,
"We're going to do this or that today."

06:15.600 --> 06:17.800
"We're going to bring out
some personality."

06:17.880 --> 06:19.840
"We're going to talk about an incident."

06:19.920 --> 06:25.120
And then Dr. Caul would say words
that would put Billy in a trance

06:26.240 --> 06:29.840
and when he came out of the trance,
he was a different personality.

06:36.480 --> 06:41.760
My first impression was
that of a frightened young fellow.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.880
Seemed to be ill at ease,

06:43.960 --> 06:50.640
didn't seem to be
very much aware of surroundings.

06:50.720 --> 06:55.040
He was involved with direct communication

06:55.520 --> 06:57.760
at a very simple level,

06:57.840 --> 07:03.480
and it turned out that it was
one of his younger alter-personalities

07:03.560 --> 07:05.880
that was speaking to me
when I first met him.

07:10.120 --> 07:16.160
My first contact with Billy Milligan
was being called to a press conference

07:16.280 --> 07:22.320
that was being held by Dr. Caul
to introduce him to the community.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.240
He wanted me to meet Billy

07:25.320 --> 07:29.160
because he thought
his life story might be important

07:29.240 --> 07:32.280
and they were talking about
collaborating on a book.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.320
Some people, on various occasions,

07:35.400 --> 07:40.320
had come
and wanted to explore Billy's case.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.800
All of a sudden, to me, there was,

07:42.880 --> 07:47.760
"Oh, we're thinking about writing
a book about your brother's life."

07:47.840 --> 07:49.880
Because that's what was hot at the time.

07:49.960 --> 07:53.560
We'd had, Three Faces of Eve,
we'd had Sybil.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.840
Caul mentioned that Daniel Keyes

07:58.920 --> 08:01.480
had written a book
called Flowers for Algernon,

08:01.560 --> 08:07.920
which sort of established his bona fides
in terms of psychodrama in a novel.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.800
So, it was quite a catch
to get someone like Daniel Keyes

08:12.880 --> 08:14.000
to write this book.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.800
About a week later,
I got a phone call from Dr. Caul,

08:18.880 --> 08:22.320
that said, "There's a meeting here,
and Billy's attorneys are here,

08:22.400 --> 08:25.480
and his sister and brother-in-law
and they like you to come down."

08:25.560 --> 08:26.920
We're sitting around the table

08:27.480 --> 08:29.160
and Billy turned to Gary Schweickart,

08:29.240 --> 08:32.080
his public defender who had
come down to Athens to see him,

08:32.600 --> 08:35.320
and he said to me,
"I want you to write my life story."

08:35.400 --> 08:40.240
So, that became kind of a quest for me
to tell this incredible, complex story

08:40.320 --> 08:42.120
of this incredible, complex human being.

08:46.920 --> 08:50.480
That's how the book started
and we said, you know, "Okay."

08:50.560 --> 08:55.800
Because we were under the assumption
that once the book was published

08:55.880 --> 08:59.840
half the proceeds would go to Billy
and half would go to Dr. Keyes.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.400
[Eberts] Daniel Keyes
was there all the time.

09:07.480 --> 09:11.840
Dr. Caul, I think, notified him
when the therapy sessions were scheduled

09:11.920 --> 09:13.680
and he would come up just for that.

09:14.920 --> 09:19.560
Well, Billy had to make himself available

09:19.640 --> 09:22.640
to Daniel Keyes for interviews.

09:23.280 --> 09:27.920
He was expected to cooperate with him
in providing material,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.400
for instance, even giving releases

09:30.480 --> 09:34.840
to see films that had been taken,
let's say, at Harding Hospital.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.280
He didn't know
he was a multiple personality

09:38.360 --> 09:42.200
till he was being observed
for seven months at Harding Hospital.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.200
[Tom Brokaw]
Does he speak only with the accent,

09:44.280 --> 09:45.800
or does he actually speak the language?

09:45.880 --> 09:49.400
Ragen has written to me in Serbo-Croatian
and I've had to send those letters out

09:49.480 --> 09:51.680
to get them translated
at different universities.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.480
-And they're accurate?
-Accurate. Yes.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.800
In addition to writing in Serbo-Croatian,
which is not easy to do,

09:56.880 --> 09:58.880
except if you're
a Serbo-Croatian, of course,

09:58.960 --> 10:02.040
what other kinds of intelligence

10:02.120 --> 10:04.800
has he demonstrated
in these other personalities

10:04.880 --> 10:05.800
that holds up?

10:05.880 --> 10:08.920
Well, Arthur, the Englishman,

10:09.000 --> 10:12.840
is a brilliant student
of medicine and chemistry.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.800
Does really he know
what he's talking about?

10:14.880 --> 10:19.400
Or does he just use the language
of a scientist or of a medical doctor?

10:19.480 --> 10:20.880
I think he's studied.

10:20.960 --> 10:24.880
Of course, it's difficult for me to tell
because I don't know the stuff myself.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.840
He has the electronics ability,
I've seen what he's constructed.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.040
He has the ability to write Arabic.
I've had them translate it.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.760
I think he knows what he's doing.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.120
[in French] I arrived one morning
at the university in Columbus, Ohio,

10:42.200 --> 10:44.120
where Keyes tells me,

10:44.200 --> 10:47.000
"In order for you
to understand straight away,

10:47.080 --> 10:48.680
I'll show you the tapes."

10:54.160 --> 10:58.000
The major question was,
"Is he using manipulation or not?"

11:00.160 --> 11:04.080
If he had played
insanity or schizophrenia,

11:04.160 --> 11:05.320
that would have been it.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.680
I then ask to see Caul.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.920
He says he has treated several cases

11:12.000 --> 11:14.400
and is currently working with Billy.

11:14.480 --> 11:17.840
He filmed Billy
and then showed him all the recordings

11:17.920 --> 11:20.400
in order to show
those alters who weren't aware,

11:20.480 --> 11:23.440
which in Milligan's topology,
if it exists,

11:23.520 --> 11:28.160
some of them aren't aware
of the others' existence.

11:28.240 --> 11:32.480
He tells him that he will
film them all and unify them.

11:36.840 --> 11:41.240
[in French] The therapy strategy of Wilbur

11:41.320 --> 11:44.560
was adopted by
the majority of Milligan's therapists.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.840
But there were also other strategies.

11:47.920 --> 11:52.480
Those would be exorcism or adorcism,

11:52.560 --> 11:56.400
which is welcoming the spirits

11:56.480 --> 11:59.880
or personalities that possess you.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.880
I hear a name. I hear a name "Mark."

12:05.800 --> 12:07.440
Uh, a "Shawn."

12:08.160 --> 12:09.400
A "Robert."

12:09.480 --> 12:10.720
Um…

12:11.560 --> 12:12.800
Just a few others.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.920
I… You know,
I've heard those names before.

12:16.640 --> 12:20.320
That… that ring out
in my head when I hear them.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.240
What do you think they mean, Billy?

12:22.320 --> 12:23.480
[Milligan] I don't know.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.760
When Billy got to Athens,

12:27.840 --> 12:34.200
there were a group of other personalities
that allegedly came forward

12:34.280 --> 12:36.200
who were "Undesirables,"

12:36.280 --> 12:39.640
meaning they were not good people,

12:39.720 --> 12:43.040
and that they were kept in the background.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.760
[with Yugoslavian accent]
The Undesirables are the people who was…

12:50.080 --> 12:51.960
silenced by Arthur.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.720
I control the spot completely.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.520
I say who is on and who is off.

12:58.600 --> 13:02.560
I'd heard that because
of some of the other crimes

13:02.640 --> 13:04.040
that he had been involved in

13:04.120 --> 13:08.520
that didn't seem to fit any
of the original ten personalities,

13:08.600 --> 13:13.480
um, that there was a possibility
that once they get into full treatment,

13:13.560 --> 13:20.520
that is not just about fusing him
to get him through the court hearing,

13:21.440 --> 13:23.880
it… it could go very deep.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.560
How many personalities
does this person have?

13:26.640 --> 13:29.080
In the beginning, the world
knew there were ten personalities.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.600
In fact, they were articles:
"The Ten Faces of Billy,"

13:31.680 --> 13:35.240
but after he was sent to the hospital
and I began to work on the book with him,

13:35.320 --> 13:39.160
we discovered that others had been hidden,
and called the "Undesirables,"

13:39.640 --> 13:41.560
and the total now is 24.

13:47.080 --> 13:53.280
This is a painting composed
of seven of Billy's alter personalities

13:53.360 --> 13:58.000
as he envisioned them
at the time that he painted them.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.640
I had originally asked him

14:00.720 --> 14:05.440
to try to paint
all 24 of the personalities,

14:05.520 --> 14:07.560
as an adjunct to therapy.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.680
I thought it might help in his treatment.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.800
There was substantial division
among the staff about,

14:13.880 --> 14:15.960
if not the validity of the diagnosis,

14:16.040 --> 14:19.320
then the extent of having 24 personalities

14:19.400 --> 14:22.600
and a visiting author
who had taken a sabbatical

14:22.680 --> 14:25.640
to come to Athens and write "the book."

14:25.720 --> 14:27.880
People knew that that was happening.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.480
And what sells a book more?
Three personalities or 24?

14:32.040 --> 14:34.000
During that period of time, Daniel,

14:34.120 --> 14:36.640
did it ever occur to you
that one of these guys

14:36.720 --> 14:38.200
is the real Billy Milligan?

14:38.280 --> 14:40.520
I was about to give up
all hope of doing a book.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.800
How do you write about someone
who has amnesia for most of his life?

14:43.880 --> 14:44.760
That's fragmented.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.880
But then, about six weeks into the book,
as I was ready to kick it over,

14:48.960 --> 14:51.040
he fused into the "Teacher."

14:51.120 --> 14:53.440
I don't want
to spend my life in institutions.

14:53.520 --> 14:54.840
I don't want to even…

14:54.920 --> 14:57.560
I don't want to spend
any part of my life in institutions.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.440
There's too much world out there.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.480
-[Caul] Let me ask you something.
-If I don't know everything I feel stupid.

15:02.560 --> 15:06.240
I was dealing with
the most articulate, the most intelligent,

15:06.320 --> 15:08.280
fascinating human being I've ever met.

15:08.360 --> 15:13.240
I never met that person,
I never interacted with that person,

15:13.320 --> 15:17.000
and it was difficult for me to…

15:17.960 --> 15:19.800
make that fit in

15:19.880 --> 15:23.120
with what I did know of Billy

15:23.200 --> 15:24.600
and how he functioned.

15:24.680 --> 15:29.440
I kind of struggled to try
to figure out the logic of the Teacher.

15:29.520 --> 15:34.880
How could a person
have the capacity to create that,

15:34.960 --> 15:40.040
um, to create all of the others
and to teach them the things

15:40.120 --> 15:42.880
without having the cognitive experiences?

15:43.480 --> 15:46.520
I don't want to convince anyone

15:46.600 --> 15:50.160
that doesn't believe it exists.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.240
I don't see that as a task.

15:52.320 --> 15:56.200
I can't deal with someone
who knows nothing about this disorder

15:57.440 --> 16:00.200
who tells me, "I don't believe it."

16:00.280 --> 16:06.040
Dr. Caul's involvement with this
was, I think, opportunistic

16:06.120 --> 16:08.440
and sort of fun for him.

16:08.960 --> 16:12.480
Uh, he enjoyed working
with the multiple personalities.

16:12.560 --> 16:16.840
He enjoyed the professional attention
and acclaim that he was getting.

16:17.360 --> 16:22.280
So, he was positively reinforced
throughout this process,

16:22.360 --> 16:25.120
and he knew that
he would be featured in "the book."

16:25.720 --> 16:30.280
My opinion as a clinician is
that that's an extraordinarily bad idea,

16:30.360 --> 16:33.680
because you then have dual relationship.

16:33.760 --> 16:38.040
That shapes what you're doing
and how you report your findings

16:38.120 --> 16:41.200
and all kinds of things,
the interactions with the patient.

16:41.280 --> 16:47.120
[in French] The fact that Caul was
particularly concerned with Billy Milligan

16:47.200 --> 16:48.200
is totally normal.

16:48.280 --> 16:53.080
Cornelia Wilbur
had made a fortune with Sybil.

16:54.120 --> 16:57.440
Caul had found his Sybil.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.080
I got on to the story

17:02.160 --> 17:06.120
after two legislators that I knew
from covering the legislature

17:06.200 --> 17:08.640
became concerned about Billy Milligan.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.280
Stinziano was a liberal Democrat,

17:11.360 --> 17:13.560
Ball was a conservative Republican,

17:14.080 --> 17:15.680
and they started tipping me off

17:15.760 --> 17:19.160
about negative things
involving Billy Milligan.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.560
One of them was this report

17:22.640 --> 17:26.240
that was written
by state police authorities,

17:26.320 --> 17:29.360
which severely criticized Dr. Caul

17:29.440 --> 17:32.480
as having a potential
conflict of interest.

17:36.280 --> 17:40.760
Caul was paid $3,000
as a consultant on the book

17:40.840 --> 17:45.640
and Caul also sought permission
from the Ohio Parole Authority

17:45.720 --> 17:49.400
to allow Billy
to go out of state to New York

17:49.480 --> 17:51.480
to appear on television stations

17:51.560 --> 17:53.880
and possibly to go to Hollywood

17:53.960 --> 17:56.880
for a movie that might be made on him.

17:56.960 --> 18:01.440
I feel like after
all of those were revealed

18:01.520 --> 18:04.040
and the books started being written

18:04.120 --> 18:06.880
and all of this discussion,

18:06.960 --> 18:10.320
I felt like we were
starting to lose the goal

18:10.400 --> 18:12.080
of getting him well.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.240
The media was going back and forth,

18:15.320 --> 18:16.600
one way or the other.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.960
They didn't give him a moment's rest.

18:23.960 --> 18:27.320
I can't say it was the healthiest
environment there either,

18:27.400 --> 18:30.120
under all of the spotlight
of the notoriety.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.280
There were a lot of controversies
about Daniel Keyes writing the book.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.520
I think because everyone thought Billy

18:42.600 --> 18:44.960
was going to get rich off of his crimes…

18:45.440 --> 18:46.960
That didn't sit well with anyone.

18:47.040 --> 18:50.920
And that's when I think
the politicians really jumped on board

18:51.000 --> 18:54.920
and said, here's my opportunity
to actually use this case

18:55.000 --> 18:57.320
to pass a bill, get publicity…

18:58.160 --> 19:01.560
Claire Ball and Mike Stinziano
were co-sponsors of the bill,

19:02.080 --> 19:04.400
um, called…
I think it was called the "Milligan Law."

19:07.400 --> 19:12.560
Any money he made from the sale
of a book about him or movie rights

19:12.640 --> 19:14.480
or his paintings or anything else,

19:14.560 --> 19:16.880
would have to go to the state.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.920
If he had a contract already,

19:23.400 --> 19:25.480
if he had a work underway already,

19:25.960 --> 19:27.440
how could you pass a law

19:27.520 --> 19:31.280
that would confiscate any profits
that might come from that?

19:38.920 --> 19:42.120
His, what they called, "treatment team"

19:42.200 --> 19:44.880
would weekly check on his status,

19:45.440 --> 19:52.040
and they ultimately decided
that they were going to allow him to have

19:52.120 --> 19:54.760
what they called "off-campus furloughs."

20:03.120 --> 20:04.920
As a patient gets better,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.080
you allow them more and more freedom.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.920
[Milligan] The people of Athens

20:15.040 --> 20:18.520
were intelligent
and compassionate towards my case.

20:19.200 --> 20:23.160
I have never encountered anyone
to come up on the street

20:23.240 --> 20:25.200
and say anything bad to me.

20:25.280 --> 20:30.480
I think that if the so-called experts
are saying he's safe to be out there

20:30.560 --> 20:33.440
and needs a chance,
I think we ought to try to help them.

20:33.960 --> 20:37.360
I'm definitely against rape,
it's a frightening thing,

20:37.440 --> 20:39.280
but in his case, I didn't feel that way,

20:39.360 --> 20:41.880
I felt he was reaching out
and he needed help.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.680
Billy developed a painting practice.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.720
I mean,
his various characters created artwork

20:52.000 --> 20:55.920
that, because of his notoriety,
people were interested in buying.

20:58.200 --> 21:01.920
He sold paintings
for sometimes thousands of dollars.

21:11.800 --> 21:15.000
He ended up having an art show

21:15.080 --> 21:18.320
in what was then called
the Athens National Bank.

21:21.720 --> 21:25.800
If they do come to see my artwork, um,

21:26.520 --> 21:31.480
I hope it's not because
they're thrill-seeking,

21:31.560 --> 21:33.360
it's because they're interested in art.

21:33.440 --> 21:36.320
I don't want to be analyzed
by my artwork, you see.

21:36.400 --> 21:40.400
I have enough
of that done as it is now, so--

21:40.480 --> 21:43.440
I think that the fact
that he was making money

21:43.520 --> 21:46.000
and, you know,
there was a book in progress,

21:46.520 --> 21:51.720
uh, there was some resentment
about that among the staff.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.560
Because it all goes back
to rapes and that sort of thing,

21:55.640 --> 21:58.000
and then this guy
making more money than we are.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.520
You know, that sort of thing.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.440
The question is:
Did he have more privileges?

22:02.520 --> 22:05.280
Was he treated differently?
And certainly yes to both of those.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.680
No other patient
was ever treated the way Billy was.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.440
He took money
from the sale of his paintings

22:10.520 --> 22:11.920
and went out and bought a car,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.320
and it was left on-ground
and he had access to it

22:14.400 --> 22:16.560
during some of his leaves.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.200
So, yeah, he was treated very differently.

22:23.160 --> 22:27.240
Claire Ball and Mike Stinziano
were the politicians

22:27.320 --> 22:33.040
who were trying to get
Billy moved to a more secure facility.

22:33.640 --> 22:37.040
They didn't like the idea
that his treatment included some freedoms.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.240
When Mr. Milligan was at the hospitals,

22:48.320 --> 22:50.440
the psychiatrist
in charge of the hospitals

22:50.520 --> 22:55.240
were able to decide whether or not
he should be granted a leave.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.600
It raised issues with people

22:57.680 --> 23:02.200
who felt that if he was still mentally ill

23:02.280 --> 23:04.440
to the point that he couldn't be released,

23:04.520 --> 23:06.320
he hadn't been restored to health.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.960
So, the legislature did change the law,

23:09.040 --> 23:14.440
then decided that if the person
was going to be given freedom

23:14.520 --> 23:16.000
or some type of leave,

23:16.080 --> 23:19.680
that the hospital would then
have to go back to the court

23:20.360 --> 23:23.640
and request that
permission to do so from the court.

23:30.360 --> 23:35.360
There were a number of incidents
that Billy got into significant problems.

23:35.440 --> 23:40.720
One of them was that
he provided alcohol and drugs

23:40.800 --> 23:44.120
to a number
of young ladies at the hospital,

23:44.240 --> 23:48.000
and went off to one of our orchards,

23:48.080 --> 23:50.560
drinking and having sex,
and doing any number of things

23:50.640 --> 23:53.360
that he was clearly
not supposed to be doing.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.000
This was viewed as, you know,

24:06.080 --> 24:09.520
we're getting perilously close
to what he got convicted of.

24:09.600 --> 24:10.920
We're talking about rapes,

24:11.000 --> 24:14.520
we're talking about people who,
you can make a case, were incompetent.

24:14.600 --> 24:17.680
They were patients
in a psychiatric facility,

24:17.760 --> 24:20.960
and so their abilities to give consent

24:21.040 --> 24:24.480
were certainly compromised
and may have been absent.

24:24.560 --> 24:29.320
So, he was right on the edge
of being involved in another rape again.

24:29.400 --> 24:32.000
And so, people took that pretty seriously.

24:35.880 --> 24:39.080
I first went in to meet him,
he was just coming out of a ward

24:39.160 --> 24:42.120
and there was a nurse there
who said, "You can't talk him,"

24:42.200 --> 24:43.800
and kept trying to interrupt him.

24:43.880 --> 24:47.080
He still told me that he wasn't
getting treatment, he needed help,

24:47.680 --> 24:49.920
and asked me to come back
the following day

24:50.000 --> 24:52.880
and he would make sure there were
arrangements made that we could talk.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.080
When I went back the next day,

24:56.160 --> 24:59.200
I was told by a guard
who blocked me from entering,

24:59.280 --> 25:01.400
that I wasn't permitted on the property

25:01.480 --> 25:04.760
and that, uh, Milligan
was no longer there anyway.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.680
[Preston]
Billy was moved from Athens to Lima

25:20.920 --> 25:22.360
in the middle of the night,

25:22.800 --> 25:24.960
right before I was, um…

25:25.040 --> 25:26.080
my wedding.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.720
His transfer to Lima was abrupt.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.040
It was without notice to anyone.

25:32.920 --> 25:37.880
It was felt that it would be accomplished
before anybody could do anything.

25:37.960 --> 25:41.880
Um, but he was moved by court order

25:41.960 --> 25:44.160
and he didn't show up at the wedding,

25:44.240 --> 25:46.160
and that's how we knew
something was wrong.

25:47.200 --> 25:51.000
He was taken there
and put in a maximum-security unit.

25:57.240 --> 25:58.840
What had happened in Athens

25:58.920 --> 26:01.280
turned out to be not as serious

26:01.360 --> 26:03.680
as they initially thought it had been.

26:03.760 --> 26:07.040
And after they realized nobody got harmed

26:07.120 --> 26:09.160
as a result of the being drunk,

26:09.240 --> 26:11.640
it seemed to me
that they should reconsider.

26:11.720 --> 26:16.280
But it was not
the political thing to argue at that time.

26:21.440 --> 26:26.280
[Porter] Lima State Hospital
was a terrible place.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.480
It was never thought of as a place
where anyone went to get treatment.

26:31.560 --> 26:34.880
It was a place where psychiatric patients

26:34.960 --> 26:36.880
were sent to be warehoused.

26:44.440 --> 26:47.760
When I got in there,
it was like a cafeteria-type room

26:47.840 --> 26:50.920
with folding chairs and tables,
almost like a high school cafeteria.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.800
And he was, at the time, frightened…

26:54.880 --> 26:56.000
acting frightened,

26:56.080 --> 26:59.160
and he was pointing
to other people in this visiting room.

26:59.240 --> 27:01.920
"There's the 22-Caliber Killer
over there."

27:02.000 --> 27:05.600
"And that guy over there
killed his wife and children."

27:05.680 --> 27:07.400
He suddenly said, "I'm scared."

27:07.480 --> 27:10.800
He was probably the least harmful
of the people that were there.

27:13.320 --> 27:15.760
He was taken off all the medications

27:15.840 --> 27:18.960
that Dr. Caul and Dr. Harding
had originally prescribed,

27:19.040 --> 27:23.080
and was re-prescribed
new medications by Dr. Lewis Lindner.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.400
He was the attending physician

27:26.480 --> 27:29.080
who was supposed to be
in charge of Billy's case,

27:29.560 --> 27:31.760
but he didn't believe in the diagnosis

27:31.840 --> 27:35.040
and he was not going to have
any nonsense from people like Billy.

27:46.560 --> 27:49.680
They wanted me to go to assess him

27:49.760 --> 27:51.960
for the purposes of a second opinion,

27:52.040 --> 27:53.400
and reading between the lines,

27:53.480 --> 27:56.800
I think they were hoping
I would contradict the diagnosis.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.920
I really didn't try to prove anything,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.720
because I was trusting
Dr. Harding and Dr. Wilbur.

28:03.280 --> 28:06.280
Well, what happens in these situations

28:06.360 --> 28:09.440
is that the conflict becomes intolerable

28:10.200 --> 28:12.560
and then a new personality emerges

28:12.640 --> 28:15.480
that deals with that particular conflict.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.680
At the time I went to Lima,

28:17.760 --> 28:21.600
I was not familiar with the treatment
that might have been offered there.

28:21.680 --> 28:23.040
But, for the most part,

28:23.120 --> 28:26.120
the only treatment
available in the prison hospital

28:26.200 --> 28:29.200
and in most of those facilities was drugs,

28:29.280 --> 28:31.880
which may have been helpful
for people with schizophrenia,

28:31.960 --> 28:35.400
but not for people with
what's called hysterical diagnoses,

28:35.480 --> 28:37.880
people who need
counseling more than medication.

28:39.040 --> 28:42.040
[Prentice] He said that they were
treating him as if he had schizophrenia

28:42.240 --> 28:45.240
and that's a totally
different treatment than DID.

28:47.400 --> 28:51.120
All it was doing
was making him fracture more.

28:51.200 --> 28:54.040
He would go to bed one day
and wake up the next day

28:54.120 --> 28:56.440
and find out
that it was actually a month later.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.440
He had no idea what had happened

28:58.520 --> 29:01.080
or if any of his alters had been out,

29:01.160 --> 29:03.360
and if they were what they had done.

29:18.560 --> 29:22.600
Dr. Box was treating Billy
as a multiple personality disorder,

29:22.680 --> 29:25.560
and Dr. Lindner
said he didn't believe in that,

29:25.640 --> 29:28.760
so they had a conflict of, um…

29:29.600 --> 29:30.600
therapies.

29:35.240 --> 29:39.400
He felt that Dr. Lindner
was one of those doctors

29:39.480 --> 29:43.880
that believed there is no such
thing as multiple personality.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.040
That there is no condition,

29:46.120 --> 29:50.040
that it shouldn't be in
the diagnostic treatment manual,

29:50.640 --> 29:52.680
that it is a fraud.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.120
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual

29:55.200 --> 29:58.320
is a kind of guidebook
to psychiatric diagnosis

29:58.400 --> 30:01.480
that's used by clinicians
and educators and researchers

30:01.560 --> 30:03.720
and in the courts all around the world,

30:03.800 --> 30:05.280
especially in the United States.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.320
Billy was manipulative in the sense

30:14.400 --> 30:16.840
that he'd learned
how to get his needs met,

30:16.920 --> 30:19.440
and patients who have
been severely traumatized

30:19.520 --> 30:22.040
learn to really
manipulate their environment.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.120
I wasn't skeptical of his condition,

30:26.200 --> 30:28.200
but I was aware of his manipulations.

30:28.280 --> 30:31.240
And he would do what he needed to do
to get what he wanted.

30:32.440 --> 30:35.720
[Jacobsen, in French]
When he was faced with Caul or Wilbur,

30:35.800 --> 30:39.160
he adopted the multiple
personality disorder strategy.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.600
He is then placed in other institutions

30:41.680 --> 30:44.800
where one does not adopt this strategy

30:44.880 --> 30:49.240
and where he is considered
a manipulator, a sociopath, etc.

30:49.320 --> 30:52.040
That's when he develops other strategies.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.320
He goes on hunger strikes,

30:54.400 --> 30:58.400
he tries to manipulate
the system of the asylum.

31:11.400 --> 31:14.600
I was always working
to try to get him out.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.680
I thought he was being warehoused.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.600
[Milligan]
My Athens attorney, Allan Goldsberry,

31:19.680 --> 31:24.320
filed a lawsuit
against Dr. Lindner in 1979.

31:24.920 --> 31:28.920
Doctors, uh, Harding and Dr. Wilbur

31:29.000 --> 31:31.760
feel that I should live
a normal and productive life

31:31.840 --> 31:33.800
outside of an institution

31:33.880 --> 31:36.120
under the right treatment program.

31:36.200 --> 31:41.160
Dr. Lindner is engineering a disaster
by taking away my medication

31:41.240 --> 31:43.040
and taking away my treatment

31:43.120 --> 31:47.800
and everything else that is now
being issued to me by a specialist.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.880
[atmospheric rock music playing]

31:52.960 --> 31:56.280
But again, the politicians were like,
"Nope. This is where he needs to be."

31:56.360 --> 31:58.280
"You can tell he can't handle himself,"

31:58.360 --> 31:59.360
and all of this.

32:18.200 --> 32:21.640
The state decided
to close Lima State Hospital

32:21.720 --> 32:24.600
and they planned to open
what they called "forensic units."

32:24.680 --> 32:28.680
There was a time period
it seemed like he moved often.

32:44.480 --> 32:48.640
[Porter] Billy was still going through
some difficult times getting treatment.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.720
He never felt he had anyone to talk to

32:50.800 --> 32:53.160
or anyone who would listen
or anyone who'd believe him.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.800
He was losing time.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.400
[static buzzing]

32:58.480 --> 33:00.960
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear

33:01.040 --> 33:03.800
that I will faithfully
execute the Office of President.

33:03.880 --> 33:07.640
[reporter 3] They were driven from
St. Paul's Cathedral to Buckingham Palace…

33:07.840 --> 33:10.120
Our next guest is Daniel Keyes
who has written a book called

33:10.200 --> 33:11.280
The Minds of Billy Milligan.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.800
It is a remarkable case

33:12.880 --> 33:15.200
and it is all documented
in a remarkable book

33:15.280 --> 33:17.600
called The Minds of Billy Milligan.

33:17.680 --> 33:20.280
How much time did you spend with him,
would you figure? Hours?

33:20.360 --> 33:24.080
Over a period of a year and a half,
something like 20 hours a week.

33:24.160 --> 33:28.280
The book is essentially his memories,
his dialogue, nothing invented.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.320
Dr. Keyes spent a lot of time
interviewing the family,

33:31.400 --> 33:35.160
interviewing people that were
involved with Billy and Billy's case,

33:35.600 --> 33:37.240
uh, trying to get the story.

33:37.800 --> 33:41.120
Um, I do know
that parts of the book is fictionalized,

33:41.600 --> 33:46.640
but he wanted to believe
everything that Billy said at all times,

33:46.720 --> 33:48.600
and that bothered me a little bit,

33:48.680 --> 33:51.880
because you're
interviewing a mentally ill patient,

33:51.960 --> 33:56.800
someone that is easily manipulated
or can manipulate others.

33:57.760 --> 34:01.440
So, that leaves the reader
to have to wonder what is real

34:01.520 --> 34:02.800
and what is not.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.640
How do we know he's not faking?

34:08.240 --> 34:10.800
Well, first of all, he was
examined for a seven-month period.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.960
The first multiple to be
examined for seven months

34:13.040 --> 34:14.880
in that fishbowl at Harding Hospital.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.640
Secondly, when he was sent to Athens,

34:17.720 --> 34:20.080
you saw Dr. David Caul talking to him.

34:20.160 --> 34:22.640
Dr. Caul uses the sodium amytal interview,

34:22.720 --> 34:25.040
which is closely…
It's a truth serum in a sense,

34:25.200 --> 34:28.240
and he wouldn't be able
to fake this for an expert.

34:28.920 --> 34:32.400
Amytal was used very often
as a kind of truth serum.

34:32.480 --> 34:37.600
It was a way of inducing,
in some people, a hypnotic state

34:37.680 --> 34:41.920
if they were resistant the way I was
to the usual induction techniques.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.040
The person just becomes
even more suggestible

34:45.480 --> 34:48.840
and it's very easy to implant ideas

34:48.920 --> 34:51.400
in someone who's either medicated

34:51.480 --> 34:56.960
or under the suggestive power
of hypnosis to accept those ideas.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.320
[in French] In this instance too,

35:00.400 --> 35:02.840
one can see how
you might obtain a state of trance,

35:02.920 --> 35:06.560
a state of irresponsibility,
a state of absence induced by medication.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.680
[in English]
I never saw Billy in any other personality

35:10.760 --> 35:13.080
unless he was being
hypnotized by Dr. Caul.

35:13.160 --> 35:15.400
When I would run into him in the hallway,

35:15.480 --> 35:18.160
um, he was always the same old Billy.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.040
I know there's an explanation for that.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.880
He's not subject to the stress

35:21.960 --> 35:25.960
that would trigger
the coming out of another personality,

35:26.040 --> 35:28.360
but when you never
see the other personalities,

35:28.840 --> 35:30.040
you begin to wonder.

35:30.560 --> 35:35.000
[with British accent] There are people
who work there that I won't talk to

35:35.080 --> 35:39.880
for the simple reason
as they wouldn't understand.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.160
They're not very open minded at all.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.840
I think that his physician encouraged him

35:47.920 --> 35:50.520
to come up with more personalities

35:50.600 --> 35:53.520
and everybody
wants to please their doctor,

35:53.600 --> 35:56.600
especially when that man is
keeping you out of prison.

35:57.120 --> 36:00.160
The people who are most hypnotizable

36:00.240 --> 36:04.120
are also the people who are best able
to create multiple personalities.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.800
Usually they're suggestible,

36:07.560 --> 36:09.360
they're imaginative,

36:10.000 --> 36:11.560
uh, they aim to please,

36:12.160 --> 36:14.120
and they're good at role-play.

36:14.200 --> 36:17.960
Many of these patients are interested
in pleasing their therapist.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.920
They want their therapist's attention,

36:20.000 --> 36:21.840
and if they think their therapist

36:21.920 --> 36:24.400
is interested in
the number of personalities they have,

36:24.480 --> 36:26.040
they'll have more personalities.

36:26.120 --> 36:29.000
The only limit to the number

36:29.080 --> 36:31.560
and the colorfulness of the personalities

36:31.640 --> 36:33.840
is the imagination of the individual

36:33.920 --> 36:35.440
and of the therapist.

36:35.520 --> 36:40.760
Unfortunately, I've seen therapists who
lose their objectivity with these cases

36:40.840 --> 36:43.640
and get too involved in the person

36:43.720 --> 36:47.080
and accept everything
that they say as reality.

36:48.400 --> 36:51.360
[Frances] Shortly after Billy Milligan,
there's an explosion

36:51.440 --> 36:53.840
of multiple personality disorder
in America.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.400
And all of a sudden
it becomes a wild hysteria

36:57.480 --> 37:01.480
where multiple personality disorder
becomes the most popular diagnosis

37:01.560 --> 37:04.120
and the number of multiples expand.

37:04.200 --> 37:07.120
So that in Three Faces of Eve
there's just three.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.120
In Sybil, she introduces 16.

37:10.200 --> 37:16.720
I saw a patient who had
162 different defined personalities.

37:16.800 --> 37:20.720
We had a workshop done by David Caul,

37:20.800 --> 37:24.600
and he believed that you
had to identify all the alters

37:24.680 --> 37:27.560
and catalog them
and figure out what their roles were.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.920
At that time, I started doing that,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.600
and I quickly figured out
that the more you do that,

37:32.680 --> 37:34.040
the more alters you get.

37:34.120 --> 37:36.240
Most of us
stopped doing that pretty quickly.

37:36.320 --> 37:41.640
Dr. Caul was really interested
in not just overseeing this case,

37:41.720 --> 37:44.480
but managing the case
and controlling the case,

37:44.560 --> 37:46.080
almost all aspects of it.

37:46.160 --> 37:49.320
[in French]
I would describe this as a double madness.

37:49.400 --> 37:53.280
You have the patient and the therapist

37:53.360 --> 37:56.320
and they ping-pong off of each other

37:56.400 --> 38:00.960
as both individuals
need to "crystallize" the concept

38:01.040 --> 38:03.040
of multiple personality disorder.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.560
[interviewer] Didn't you doubt?

38:04.640 --> 38:07.840
Every Monday morning I'd wake up saying,
"Oh my God, I don't believe it."

38:08.480 --> 38:09.440
It's incredible.

38:09.520 --> 38:12.920
But in the ten months
I interviewed him on audiotape,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.360
as I say,
some hundreds and hundreds of hours,

38:15.440 --> 38:18.080
I discovered I never got an inconsistency.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.760
I was not skeptical originally.

38:24.840 --> 38:27.440
I became more skeptical as time went by.

38:27.520 --> 38:30.120
A few things happened,
I suppose, to cause that,

38:30.200 --> 38:34.400
and I can remember one conspicuous moment

38:34.480 --> 38:38.280
when he was talking to Dr. Knopp.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.640
He was a native of the Czech Republic.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.680
He had been drafted
into the German workforce

38:43.760 --> 38:45.040
during World War II,

38:45.120 --> 38:46.760
sent to the Russian front,

38:46.840 --> 38:50.520
and while he was there, he learned
several Eastern-European languages,

38:50.600 --> 38:52.480
one of which was Serbo-Croatian,

38:53.000 --> 38:57.520
and Dr. Knopp tried
to talk to Ragen in Serbo-Croatian.

38:57.640 --> 39:02.040
Ragen immediately
flipped back out of that personality.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.320
Dr. Knopp tried this several times,

39:05.800 --> 39:09.560
and every time Ragen
could not cough up any Serbo-Croatian.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.480
So, you know… [chuckles]

39:12.560 --> 39:15.520
It's not a miracle condition.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.120
It's whatever.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.440
Whatever gifts…

39:19.520 --> 39:21.000
And again, he was bright.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.480
This was a much brighter
than average individual.

39:23.560 --> 39:26.640
…were those that were
inherent in who Billy was.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.240
It wasn't just my experiences with him.

39:29.320 --> 39:32.600
I had hundreds
of conversations with staff,

39:33.120 --> 39:35.240
many of whom
would share their experiences,

39:35.320 --> 39:37.520
what they had seen and heard,

39:37.600 --> 39:40.280
and the reasons why they doubted

39:40.360 --> 39:42.560
that it was all it was cracked up to be.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.920
Billy claimed when he was an inmate

39:51.000 --> 39:53.960
down here at the hospital
for the criminally insane,

39:54.040 --> 39:55.840
that he could write Arabic.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.320
[interviewer] Dan Keyes,
who wrote the book about you,

39:58.400 --> 40:00.200
received a letter in Arabic.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.920
That was from Arthur.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.920
Does this mean that Arthur wrote it?

40:05.800 --> 40:06.760
Yeah.

40:06.840 --> 40:07.760
Are you sure?

40:07.840 --> 40:09.440
Arthur wrote it. Yeah.

40:09.520 --> 40:13.120
It turned out that
those letters were not written by Billy,

40:13.760 --> 40:16.920
but by a fellow inmate who was an Arab.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.800
[reporter 4]
Ayad Kalini, an Egyptian, a murderer,

40:19.880 --> 40:22.240
was being treated there for schizophrenia.

40:22.320 --> 40:26.040
He used to ask me to help him

40:26.120 --> 40:29.320
to learn some Arabic-Egyptian language,

40:29.960 --> 40:32.760
and also he used to ask me

40:32.840 --> 40:34.920
if I can help him translate, uh…

40:36.040 --> 40:39.080
some English letter to Egyptian.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.320
Let me suggest to you that maybe Arthur
was cunning and clever enough

40:42.400 --> 40:44.840
to find somebody
to write the letter in Arabic for him.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.280
[scoffs]

40:47.360 --> 40:49.680
In that dungeon, in Lima?

40:51.200 --> 40:53.800
No, uh, Arabs in Lima. [laughs]

40:54.840 --> 40:57.360
[in French]
Every multiple personality case

40:57.440 --> 41:00.120
is an imitation, a reproduction,

41:00.200 --> 41:03.280
a copy of an earlier case.

41:03.360 --> 41:07.160
And we could go back
to the time of Janet and Charcot,

41:07.240 --> 41:10.320
where there were
multiple personalities of all kinds,

41:10.400 --> 41:12.840
created, built under hypnosis.

41:12.920 --> 41:15.360
That is to say, a trance phenomenon.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.440
Since the beginning of time,

41:17.520 --> 41:21.840
you have had people who
put themselves into states of trance

41:21.920 --> 41:26.960
during which you are no longer yourself
and thus, you are not responsible.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.400
We were hopeful
that things would calm down a bit.

41:53.480 --> 41:55.320
Dr. Caul became his doctor again,

41:55.400 --> 41:58.400
and we tried to get him
back on a good protocol,

41:58.480 --> 42:01.240
because he had been
so messed up by the drug and everything.

42:01.840 --> 42:03.120
I would have to say

42:03.200 --> 42:06.480
I don't think that he was
dangerous when he was in Athens.

42:06.960 --> 42:09.120
Um, he was too widely recognized

42:09.840 --> 42:12.720
and he had
too much on the line at that point.

42:12.800 --> 42:16.880
But, um, as a general rule,
he behaved himself

42:16.960 --> 42:21.240
and conducted himself in a way
that would get him out of confinement

42:21.320 --> 42:22.880
as quickly as possible.

42:22.960 --> 42:25.840
While he was with us, he became, uh…

42:26.520 --> 42:29.800
He was quite sexually
exploitive of other patients.

42:30.320 --> 42:34.640
He managed to become
sexually involved with one of our staff.

42:34.720 --> 42:38.480
He was particularly notorious
for the young women

42:39.240 --> 42:42.280
that came through the hospital
in various ways,

42:42.360 --> 42:45.480
but it was not uncommon
for volunteers and students,

42:45.560 --> 42:48.040
"Is this Billy Milligan's room?
Wow, cool!"

42:48.120 --> 42:48.960
[chuckles]

43:04.280 --> 43:06.680
When Billy was
at the Dayton Forensic Center,

43:06.760 --> 43:12.000
one of the inmates or patients
was a gentleman named Don Bartley,

43:12.080 --> 43:15.960
and he and Billy
became friends or co-patients

43:16.520 --> 43:20.680
and Tanda, Don's sister,
would come to visit,

43:20.760 --> 43:22.720
and so that's how she met Billy.

43:29.880 --> 43:31.880
[reporter 5]
The wedding took place at one o'clock

43:31.960 --> 43:34.440
in the visitors' room
at the Forensic Center,

43:34.520 --> 43:36.640
and only a handful of guests attended.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.520
One of them was Dr. Daniel Keyes,

43:38.600 --> 43:41.480
author of a book
on Milligan's multiple personalities,

43:41.560 --> 43:44.880
who said this wedding had
nothing to do with a quest for publicity.

43:44.960 --> 43:48.760
I didn't know about this love affair
or the marriage until a few months ago.

43:48.840 --> 43:50.800
-You think it's for real?
-I think they're in love.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.400
I believe in love, don't you?

43:52.480 --> 43:54.720
Well, the media from the very get go,

43:54.800 --> 43:57.520
from the idea that he wanted
to be married, was all over that,

43:57.600 --> 44:01.000
because this was this mental patient
going to marry somebody.

44:02.440 --> 44:05.520
If I base Billy
on everything that I had read,

44:05.600 --> 44:07.080
I would have never married him.

44:07.160 --> 44:09.120
I got to know him, and I put aside

44:09.200 --> 44:12.160
all the myths and rumors
and things like that.

44:12.240 --> 44:14.280
I put all that aside and I got to know him

44:14.360 --> 44:17.120
and I think I've dealt with Billy

44:17.200 --> 44:19.440
in different situations,
different personalities,

44:19.520 --> 44:23.480
and it's acceptable to me
and I realize my responsibility in it.

44:25.920 --> 44:29.120
Um, and then it wasn't shortly thereafter

44:29.200 --> 44:33.440
that, um, she decided that
maybe she had made a mistake.

44:39.600 --> 44:43.080
She wrote him a nice goodbye letter,
"I can't do this,"

44:43.160 --> 44:48.240
took the money that he got
from some of the book royalty and left.

45:00.720 --> 45:03.760
Dr. Caul began to work with him again

45:03.840 --> 45:07.560
and wanted to treat him again
with outpatient treatments

45:07.640 --> 45:13.040
and eventually go back into
the community and live a normal life,

45:13.120 --> 45:16.640
and that's what he was…
kept trying to get to.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.160
It's been a long five years

45:18.240 --> 45:21.400
and I just want to be normal
and like anybody else

45:21.480 --> 45:23.800
and live a normal life,

45:23.880 --> 45:28.440
but I've got a lot more to prove
than the average person now.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.240
The entire time that he's been in Athens

45:35.320 --> 45:37.280
it's been extremely controversial,

45:37.360 --> 45:40.640
because he has been
allowed out into the community

45:40.720 --> 45:42.840
and many people have worried about that.

45:42.920 --> 45:46.080
I think he's a threat
to a certain part of the community.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.360
Mainly the women.

45:48.040 --> 45:49.720
I don't feel personally threatened by him,

45:49.800 --> 45:52.560
but, I guess,
for the safety of the community

45:52.640 --> 45:55.480
I wonder whether he should be free or not.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.440
Anybody who's been convicted of rape,

45:58.760 --> 46:02.840
um, should not
be allowed to be free, that's all.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.520
When Billy had the freedom

46:10.800 --> 46:14.720
to come and go from the hospital
and still get his treatment,

46:14.800 --> 46:16.760
he decided to rent a farm,

46:16.840 --> 46:22.360
got some cattle and decided that
he wanted to just be left alone.

46:22.960 --> 46:23.800
Get her.

46:23.880 --> 46:24.840
Bring her in.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.040
Take her in, Caesar!

46:31.800 --> 46:34.360
So, here's a guy
who's been through Lima State Hospital

46:34.440 --> 46:37.840
and incarcerated a lot of his life,
or his adult life,

46:38.560 --> 46:42.720
and he's able to have
this beautiful Ohio University student

46:42.800 --> 46:45.600
who's on the tennis team, Becky Burkhart.

46:46.080 --> 46:47.760
He's painting,

46:47.840 --> 46:51.200
he's founded
a foundation for battered children.

46:52.280 --> 46:55.800
So he… I met him
during the best time of his life.

46:55.880 --> 46:58.120
[upbeat rock music playing]

47:05.080 --> 47:08.480
In 1984, I was producing
a 15-part soap opera

47:08.560 --> 47:12.160
and we invited the mayor and judges

47:12.240 --> 47:14.680
and the police chief
and all kinds of celebrities

47:14.760 --> 47:18.440
to be in the soap opera
as cameos, to play themselves.

47:18.520 --> 47:21.280
And about the same time,
Billy was well enough

47:21.360 --> 47:24.160
that he was being released
back out into the community.

47:24.240 --> 47:27.200
My feeling was that most people
didn't know who Billy Milligan was

47:27.280 --> 47:29.720
except through the headlines
as the rapist,

47:29.840 --> 47:33.320
and so maybe if I invited him
to be in the soap opera,

47:33.400 --> 47:35.440
people could see a different side of him.

47:37.240 --> 47:38.960
You're Billy Milligan, aren't you?

47:39.040 --> 47:41.360
-Yeah, you're Adam Star, aren't you?
-Yeah!

47:41.440 --> 47:45.280
I recognized you from
the, uh, soap opera, 45701.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.240
Oh…

47:46.320 --> 47:50.080
Jim Murray, the producer,
played a multiple personality

47:50.160 --> 47:51.760
and Billy was the normal one.

47:51.840 --> 47:55.400
So, he had an amazing sense of humor
for what he'd been through.

47:55.480 --> 47:58.480
It'd been planned that we would
just do one scene and that would be it,

47:58.560 --> 48:02.280
but more and more
we became closer friends.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.920
I spent hundreds and hundreds
of hours with Billy Milligan.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.320
I never felt endangered,

48:09.880 --> 48:12.440
except once we were hiking.

48:12.520 --> 48:15.160
He wanted to show me
a particular place he used to hang out

48:15.240 --> 48:16.680
when he was in high school

48:16.760 --> 48:20.960
and suddenly a chill
went across my entire body,

48:21.640 --> 48:23.120
because it was only Billy and I,

48:23.200 --> 48:27.840
and we had not seen anybody
for 40 minutes of hiking, you know?

48:27.920 --> 48:31.320
And I don't know
if he had switched personalities

48:31.400 --> 48:34.840
and I had become
subconsciously aware of it, and…

48:35.480 --> 48:38.880
Or if it was just that
I suddenly realized how vulnerable I was.

48:38.960 --> 48:42.640
I didn't say anything about it
and it went away and--

48:42.720 --> 48:46.120
But I never went hiking
with him again in a lonely place.

48:50.240 --> 48:52.840
As a reporter with the local paper,

48:52.920 --> 48:56.240
part of my duties were to go
and do the "cop shop," as we would say.

48:56.320 --> 48:59.520
First thing in the morning,
stop by the sheriff's department,

49:00.120 --> 49:03.960
go in, the big glass,
and they'd give me the reports.

49:04.520 --> 49:06.400
And there would be Sheriff Bob Allen,

49:06.480 --> 49:10.120
"I'm going to put that Billy Milligan
back behind bars, Woodward!"

49:17.360 --> 49:19.080
Early on when Billy came to Athens,

49:19.160 --> 49:21.760
Sheriff Allen just seemed
to have something with him.

49:21.840 --> 49:23.000
He did not like this guy.

49:23.080 --> 49:27.080
But he publicly said, or is quoted
in the newspapers regularly as saying,

49:27.160 --> 49:29.760
he was going to put this guy
back behind bars where he belonged.

49:29.840 --> 49:32.600
As far as I'm concerned,
I don't even want him in my county.

49:33.400 --> 49:36.760
If Judge Flowers wants him loose,
let him turn him loose in his backyard.

49:37.520 --> 49:38.560
Not mine.

49:39.080 --> 49:40.680
But they had adjoining properties,

49:40.760 --> 49:44.040
and so that led
to confrontations and conflicts.

49:44.120 --> 49:48.800
Billy accused Scott Allen,
Sheriff Allen's son, Scott,

49:48.880 --> 49:50.920
of shooting at his dogs.

49:51.680 --> 49:54.600
[Milligan] Just a few months
after I got out of the hospital,

49:54.680 --> 50:00.280
his son shot at my dog, Caesar,
who's a German shepherd.

50:01.120 --> 50:03.440
He accused my dog of chasing his horses,

50:03.520 --> 50:06.120
but my dog didn't chase his horses.

50:06.680 --> 50:08.320
That was just not a good mix.

50:08.400 --> 50:12.000
That was not good for Sheriff Allen
to drive by Billy's house

50:12.080 --> 50:14.000
every single day on the way home.

50:15.160 --> 50:18.520
There had been reports that Sheriff Allen

50:18.600 --> 50:21.200
was basically out to get Billy.

50:21.280 --> 50:24.480
I called Sheriff Allen and asked him

50:24.560 --> 50:29.000
and he said he would have no problem
hiring two guys to go out and kill him.

50:32.480 --> 50:35.640
I've finally found a place that I fit in.

50:37.760 --> 50:40.360
And Bob's trying to take that away from me

50:40.440 --> 50:42.400
and I just don't want it to happen.

50:43.200 --> 50:46.360
There was a lot of people who
did feel he was a con man somehow,

50:46.440 --> 50:47.920
but he was on the streets.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
He was, you know, part of the community.

50:50.480 --> 50:52.760
And then came the barn incident.

50:52.840 --> 50:54.920
[suspenseful music playing]

50:55.000 --> 50:56.960
[gun shots]

50:58.360 --> 51:02.320
The worst episodes
of behavioral problems with Billy,

51:02.400 --> 51:04.760
and it reinforced the community's fear,

51:05.240 --> 51:09.800
was when he was riding around
in a car with a hospital staffer,

51:09.880 --> 51:14.320
shot a gun through the trailer
of that staffer's supervisor.

51:19.600 --> 51:21.880
They all got caught, basically.

51:21.960 --> 51:25.200
Billy would have been
put on severe restrictions at that point

51:25.280 --> 51:27.200
pending the investigation.

51:27.280 --> 51:29.800
It was ongoing news. It was…

51:29.880 --> 51:32.120
Mostly it would just rehash the same story

51:32.200 --> 51:34.480
and Billy would deny that it had happened.

51:35.360 --> 51:38.200
I admit I have been
with Mr. Russell before,

51:38.880 --> 51:42.080
but when he shot this guy's barn,

51:42.160 --> 51:44.240
I was nowhere around him.

51:44.320 --> 51:48.080
I was in town
and I was in different places

51:48.160 --> 51:49.720
and I was at home.

51:49.800 --> 51:52.480
I couldn't-- I don't even know
what time it happened.

51:52.600 --> 51:57.360
So, his sort of
great little world that he'd established

51:58.000 --> 51:59.400
was just shattered.

52:06.200 --> 52:08.960
I heard a rumor that two inmates at Athens

52:09.040 --> 52:13.680
had claimed to have been
hired by Allen to kill Milligan.

52:14.160 --> 52:19.320
That Bob Allen had paid,
or was going to pay, two inmates to…

52:20.000 --> 52:21.280
to kill Billy,

52:21.360 --> 52:23.320
murder him and make it
look like a suicide.

52:23.400 --> 52:26.880
[Prentice] I don't know that anyone
actually believed them, to be honest.

52:27.320 --> 52:30.160
I don't know that Sheriff Allen would
have done that, but he might have,

52:30.240 --> 52:32.840
or it could be just another story
that Billy came up with,

52:32.920 --> 52:35.600
or that Billy paid the inmates to lie.

52:35.680 --> 52:38.160
It's one of those stories
we may never know the end of.

52:41.520 --> 52:43.000
I have no idea.

52:43.440 --> 52:46.640
Bob Allen, he just had this anger.

52:46.720 --> 52:49.840
He wanted to be
judge, jury, and executioner.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.440
I'll deny it till the day I die.

52:53.640 --> 52:57.520
Congratulations, Back to the Future
is still number one at the box office.

52:57.600 --> 52:59.640
[man] What are you going
to say to Mr. Gorbachev, sir,

52:59.720 --> 53:01.520
to try to convince him
that you want peace?

53:01.600 --> 53:04.480
[reporter 6] Milligan will go
on trial at the Athens County Courthouse,

53:04.560 --> 53:07.840
charged with perjury, vandalism,
and intimidation of a witness.

53:12.680 --> 53:15.640
I stopped representing Billy Milligan

53:15.720 --> 53:18.960
because he was not accepting my advice,

53:19.040 --> 53:21.000
and that went on and on,

53:21.080 --> 53:24.680
finally culminating
in going to the Grand Jury to testify,

53:24.760 --> 53:26.560
after I had told him,

53:26.640 --> 53:30.320
"You do not have to go there.
It will not end well for you."

53:31.520 --> 53:33.680
Despite the objections of the prosecutor

53:33.760 --> 53:35.760
and disregarding his lawyers' advices,

53:35.840 --> 53:39.440
Billy Milligan asked the Court
to let him be his own attorney.

53:46.520 --> 53:50.560
We had had earlier testimony
presented by Sheriff Allen,

53:51.160 --> 53:53.960
where he had presented evidence

53:54.040 --> 53:57.160
that he had
been threatened by Billy Milligan,

53:57.240 --> 54:01.280
and Mr. Allen pulled out
a tape recorder that he had in his pocket

54:01.360 --> 54:04.400
when he had
had a conversation with Mr. Milligan.

54:04.480 --> 54:10.520
Billy said in very clear terms,
"Bob, I'm going to kill you."

54:10.600 --> 54:12.880
"I'm going after your family, too."

54:12.960 --> 54:14.120
It was frightening.

54:14.200 --> 54:18.760
So, we asked questions along the lines,
"Well, did you ever threaten the sheriff?"

54:18.840 --> 54:23.080
And the answer was,
"Oh, no. Oh, no. Of course not."

54:23.160 --> 54:24.280
"Why would I do that?"

54:24.360 --> 54:26.680
He was a very persuasive person.

54:27.360 --> 54:30.080
I actually thought
he would make a great lawyer.

54:30.160 --> 54:33.240
He has a great ability to persuade.

54:35.880 --> 54:41.280
The strange thing was
the charges against Billy Milligan

54:41.360 --> 54:43.280
never came to trial.

54:47.200 --> 54:50.960
Mr. Allen, the sheriff,
had recorded a conversation

54:51.040 --> 54:52.880
and that's illegal.

54:52.960 --> 54:56.800
So, the judge had no choice
but to dismiss the charges.

55:00.280 --> 55:04.000
[Preston] Then he was
moved back to the Columbus area,

55:04.080 --> 55:06.040
to the Timothy Moritz Center.

55:09.560 --> 55:12.480
When Billy was transferred
to the Timothy Moritz Center,

55:12.560 --> 55:16.320
Dr. Lindner from Lima was the doctor,

55:16.400 --> 55:18.160
was the treating physician there.

55:23.760 --> 55:28.280
I don't think anybody
really understands what punishment is

55:29.280 --> 55:31.160
until they've been through therapy,

55:31.960 --> 55:36.640
until they've been worked with
by a psychiatrist.

55:39.440 --> 55:41.240
Why do you keep doing this to me?

55:42.320 --> 55:45.160
He had been in the psychiatric system,

55:45.240 --> 55:47.720
now going on five or six years.

55:48.240 --> 55:50.880
Um, well, even
prior to that as a teenager,

55:50.960 --> 55:54.920
and had really not gotten
any of the significant help

55:55.000 --> 55:56.160
that he really needed.

55:58.280 --> 56:01.160
He became depressed and despondent.

56:01.240 --> 56:05.280
So, he was clearly not as well there

56:05.360 --> 56:08.040
as when I had
spent time with him in Athens,

56:08.120 --> 56:11.080
because he was switching more regularly
right in front of me.

56:11.600 --> 56:14.840
Um, six months ago, when I went to court

56:14.920 --> 56:16.640
for my probate hearing,

56:17.280 --> 56:20.240
Dr. Lindner made a point of…

56:21.160 --> 56:24.440
to the court and opposed
my leaving the institution

56:24.520 --> 56:28.320
on the grounds that he could
not be sure that I was complying

56:28.400 --> 56:32.040
with taking a medication
that I so desperately needed.

56:32.680 --> 56:33.880
Um…

56:33.960 --> 56:37.720
Now, he has done a complete turnaround,

56:37.800 --> 56:40.680
saying that he wants me
back in the institution

56:40.760 --> 56:44.280
because he no longer
wants me to take this medication

56:44.360 --> 56:46.400
which has been so helpful to me.

56:47.200 --> 56:50.080
Uh, it does leave me quite confused.

[Murray]
On the Fourth of July weekend in 1986,

57:01.960 --> 57:05.520
according to Billy, Dr. Lindner told him

57:05.600 --> 57:09.400
that his treatment team would not
be around to protect him,

57:10.040 --> 57:12.880
and Dr. Lindner
was in charge of the hospital.

57:12.960 --> 57:16.600
They had a confrontation
and Billy was, um,

57:16.680 --> 57:18.440
afraid of Dr. Lindner,

57:18.520 --> 57:20.280
because Dr. Lindner, as I understand,

57:20.360 --> 57:24.400
had, even at Lima, had wanted
to perform shock treatment on him.

57:24.480 --> 57:26.840
Billy saw this as a threat.

57:32.400 --> 57:35.040
[Preston] I mean,
and he's under Dr. Lindner again,

57:35.920 --> 57:39.960
the person responsible for the Thorazine
and everything that happened in Lima.

57:40.840 --> 57:43.600
He felt that his life was in danger.

57:44.280 --> 57:47.120
And so Billy, at that time,

57:47.200 --> 57:50.280
walked away from COPH Hospital.

57:51.120 --> 57:53.120
[siren wailing]

57:53.200 --> 57:54.840
[reporter 7] Milligan ran away on Friday.

57:54.920 --> 57:57.040
He is now searched all over the state.

57:57.120 --> 57:59.640
For Milligan, this change
in his treatment at the hospital

57:59.720 --> 58:01.920
is a ploy to keep him institutionalized.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.240
[Frances] The FBI got involved,
then that became a national issue.

58:05.760 --> 58:09.120
[Ruth] He would do some crazy thing
that would put him in the headlines again.

58:09.200 --> 58:11.400
[Preston] Who wouldn't try to escape that?

58:11.520 --> 58:15.240
[Milligan] I left the hospital
as an issue of self-defense.

58:15.320 --> 58:18.560
I am not a danger
to myself or anyone else.

58:19.560 --> 58:21.200
[man 2] And when that medication runs out,

58:21.280 --> 58:23.280
he could fragment
and become very dangerous.

58:23.360 --> 58:27.000
In my gut, ever since
the beginning of time with this case

58:27.080 --> 58:29.360
I've sensed a tragic ending.

58:29.440 --> 58:31.280
I hope my gut feelings are wrong.
