00:03.120 --> 00:07.400
This programme
contains strong language

00:07.400 --> 00:13.520
CHANTING: Genesis. Genesis.
Genesis. Genesis...

00:16.239 --> 00:19.360
CHANTING CONTINUES

00:26.880 --> 00:29.320
MUSIC: Turn It On Again

00:34.280 --> 00:36.440
Yeah, forget about all this
other bullshit.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.840
We are entertaining people,

00:37.840 --> 00:41.520
and if they're entertained
we've done our job properly!

00:41.520 --> 00:43.160
MUSIC: Invisible Touch

00:43.160 --> 00:45.600
# She seems to have an
invisible touch yeah

00:45.600 --> 00:48.720
# She reaches in and she grabs right
hold of your heart... #

00:48.720 --> 00:50.880
No, I love this.
It's great having hits.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.680
MUSIC: Jesus He Knows Me

00:52.680 --> 00:55.840
# Cos Jesus he knows me
and he knows I'm right... #

00:55.840 --> 00:58.840
In those days there were no real
rules. I think

00:58.840 --> 01:00.800
we were just trying to be
a bit different,

01:00.800 --> 01:03.200
because the canvas
in those days in the '60s

01:03.200 --> 01:04.879
and the '70s was pretty blank.

01:04.879 --> 01:07.280
MUSIC: The Knife

01:07.280 --> 01:09.680
# Carry their heads
to the palace of old

01:09.680 --> 01:11.760
# Hang them high
let the blood flow... #

01:13.280 --> 01:15.240
The basic feel was radically
different

01:15.240 --> 01:16.680
than anything I'd ever done.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.680
Very British, actually!

01:20.400 --> 01:22.560
Aye, aye, aye, ah!

01:22.560 --> 01:25.800
It's not country, it's not rock,
it's not jazz, you know,

01:25.800 --> 01:27.360
it's Genesis.

01:27.360 --> 01:31.600
# There must be
some misunderstanding... #

01:33.120 --> 01:36.320
A very competitive band,
no doubt about that. Very gifted,

01:36.320 --> 01:39.400
but with those gifts,
you know, there's a certain price.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.320
MUSIC: I Can't Dance

01:41.320 --> 01:44.480
It was always, you know,
beating each other into submission.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.600
# I can't talk... #

01:46.600 --> 01:47.720
We pulled rank!

01:47.720 --> 01:51.400
# The only thing about me is the way
that I walk... #

01:51.400 --> 01:54.240
Peter and I used to fight a lot.
Very close friends but, you know,

01:54.240 --> 01:56.960
used to argue about silly
little things.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.160
MUSIC: I Know What I Like
(In Your Wardrobe)

02:00.160 --> 02:03.800
No, he was a really awkward bastard!

02:03.800 --> 02:05.600
But we loved each other too,

02:05.600 --> 02:07.840
you know, there was a real bond.

02:07.840 --> 02:11.120
They were at the forefront of what
we now think of as prog rock.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.240
Then in the '80s,
they were a massive

02:13.240 --> 02:15.800
rock/pop band on both
sides of the Atlantic.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.680
MUSIC: That's All

02:17.680 --> 02:19.480
# Just as I thought
it was going all right

02:19.480 --> 02:21.480
# I found that I'm wrong
when I thought I was right

02:21.480 --> 02:24.080
# It's always the same
it's just a shame

02:24.080 --> 02:25.920
# That's all... #

02:25.920 --> 02:29.160
Genesis were never cool, and Genesis
are proof that, ultimately,

02:29.160 --> 02:30.880
in rock music brains win out.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.480
MUSIC: Sledgehammer by Peter Gabriel

02:32.480 --> 02:37.280
# I wanna be your sledgehammer... #

02:37.280 --> 02:41.760
There's something in the DNA of that
group that's still connected,

02:41.760 --> 02:44.080
even though they were
in different places.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.640
MUSIC: In The Air Tonight
by Phil Collins

02:46.640 --> 02:51.400
# I can feel it
coming in the air tonight... #

02:51.400 --> 02:54.760
Whenever, sort of, Spinal Tap
is on or something and you see these

02:54.760 --> 03:00.360
moments you think, "I've been in a
band like that! That's Genesis".

03:00.360 --> 03:01.640
No, they don't think so.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.960
We had something that none of us
could do on our own.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.560
MUSIC: A Change Is Gonna Come
by Otis Redding

03:36.160 --> 03:40.880
I was at school, and I remember
exactly which room I was in,

03:40.880 --> 03:45.120
and I heard this thing coming
out of the radio, and phrew.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.800
Otis Reading was my hero at that
time, I think.

03:48.800 --> 03:53.520
It felt very free,
it was sort of hot, sexy, alive,

03:53.520 --> 04:00.200
and it had obviously come
out of blues and pain and suffering.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.240
# That change has gotta come, yeah

04:03.240 --> 04:06.880
# Ooh, yes, it is
oh, my, oh, my... #

04:06.880 --> 04:10.120
The rigours of that school would have
given them something to kick against.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.080
There was a revolutionary impulse
within them, which is that -

04:13.080 --> 04:14.400
despite the constraints of that,

04:14.400 --> 04:16.800
you know, very traditional public
school education -

04:16.800 --> 04:19.040
they thought, "We
want to make a living out of music."

04:19.040 --> 04:21.160
It was music that got them
through their day.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.920
That's where Genesis developed this
desire to create something

04:23.920 --> 04:26.440
that was elaborate and big and grand

04:26.440 --> 04:29.840
and sprawling, that kind of pushed
those rigours out of their life.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.880
The demo session was Mike
and I saying, "Tony will you come

04:32.880 --> 04:36.080
"and help us with the keyboards?"
And he said, "Yeah, I'll do it

04:36.080 --> 04:38.560
"if my mate Peter Gabriel can
come along and sing one song."

04:38.560 --> 04:40.760
It was called She Is Beautiful
to start with.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.200
I'm not sure what it ended up as.
It was a lovely song.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.240
So we hustled our way into
their session.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.520
# She is beautiful

04:48.520 --> 04:50.920
# Very beautiful... #

04:50.920 --> 04:55.600
We'd done these demos and it was
OC's day, Old Carthusian day,

04:55.600 --> 04:58.480
Jonathan King was spotted there.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.680
I was a successful pop star,

05:00.680 --> 05:03.960
the first act on the London
Top Of The Pops show.

05:03.960 --> 05:07.440
And, of course, I went back to
Charterhouse in glory,

05:07.440 --> 05:09.520
in my little Austin-Healey Sprite.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.280
And one of the kids at Charterhouse
rushed up to me

05:12.280 --> 05:16.360
with a grubby cassette tape,
that I still have to this day,

05:16.360 --> 05:19.680
and said, "Oh, this is the school
group, listen to it."

05:19.680 --> 05:22.080
# For them you're just a product

05:23.240 --> 05:27.320
# For me you're the one I love

05:27.320 --> 05:30.360
# Baby... #

05:30.360 --> 05:33.840
The lead singer had THE most
wonderful voice, I thought.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.280
So I got in touch with them
and said,

05:36.280 --> 05:39.040
"Look, I really like the sound of
you, I'd like to produce you."

05:39.040 --> 05:40.920
And they said, "Oh, yes, please".

05:40.920 --> 05:43.760
I gave them the name Genesis
because that, to me,

05:43.760 --> 05:45.600
was the start of my production
career.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.280
We did an album -
From Genesis To Revelation

05:52.280 --> 05:54.960
which was just bought by us
and our friends.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.800
And, you know, and then pretty much
that looked like it, and he,

05:57.800 --> 06:00.840
sort of, was losing interest and
everything, which was fair enough.

06:00.840 --> 06:03.640
I'm not very good with really good
creative artists.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.320
I'm actually better with people
just doing as I say,

06:07.320 --> 06:09.560
because it's my work of art that
I want to do.

06:11.680 --> 06:15.080
My parents had a cottage near
Dorking in Surrey, quite remote.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.680
They let us use it.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.520
You know, it was very turbulent.

06:19.520 --> 06:23.160
They're very strong characters,
you know, and we were kind of -

06:23.160 --> 06:26.440
slightly... t was a bit of a
pressure cooker situation.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.840
The guys never saw their girlfriends
half the time, it was

06:28.840 --> 06:30.400
positively draconian.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.920
But we were too serious.
We never went for walks.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.600
We weren't the sort of group to
go down the pub and have pints

06:35.600 --> 06:37.520
and, you know, relax.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.760
Ant was also, probably, the best
musician at the time.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.920
He was the only one who could
actually do something

06:44.920 --> 06:46.240
with his instrument.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.440
And he kind of brought me on really,
he taught me some chords.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.760
Kind of early days in the writing
sessions

06:55.760 --> 06:57.320
with Ant it was two guitars.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.360
Ant and myself playing guitars,
Tony keyboards

07:00.360 --> 07:04.120
and Pete a bit of keyboards, you
know, but more the vocals really.

07:04.120 --> 07:07.720
Sneaking away from school to come to
these hippie events,

07:07.720 --> 07:11.920
to then be offered to perform in an
Atomic Sunrise Festival, it sounded,

07:11.920 --> 07:15.960
you know,
like a thing we couldn't say no to.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.000
The Roundhouse was somewhere where,
you know,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.280
concerts were not just concerts,
they were happenings, you know,

07:21.280 --> 07:24.920
and it would be somewhere you'd go
to commune with kindred spirits.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.960
People would sit
and happily close their eyes

07:26.960 --> 07:29.080
and listen to songs that
lasted 25 minutes.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.720
And Genesis just at that time
fitted right in there.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.880
I remember finding it all starting
to get terribly tense,

07:34.880 --> 07:37.080
and I used to be very frightened.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.280
# Looking for someone

07:52.160 --> 07:56.600
# I guess I'm doing that

07:58.840 --> 08:02.280
# Trying to find
a memory in a dark room

08:02.280 --> 08:04.920
# Dirty man,
"You're looking like a Buddha"

08:04.920 --> 08:06.560
# I heard him say... #

08:08.680 --> 08:12.120
The Atomic Sunrise Festival
I remember mainly for there

08:12.120 --> 08:14.720
being more people on stage than
there were in the audience.

08:14.720 --> 08:19.760
Tony and I, particularly Tony, were
both Bowie fans from very early on.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.640
# Children of the summer's end

08:23.640 --> 08:26.680
# Gathered in
the dampened grass... #

08:26.680 --> 08:29.320
Bowie's band were very
theatrical at the time

08:29.320 --> 08:32.360
and it wasn't sort of
Ziggy-type costumes,

08:32.360 --> 08:37.240
it was more sort of raiding
the theatre costume department.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.080
Then of course came the first
official,

08:40.080 --> 08:42.720
if you like, Genesis album,
with Trespass.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.800
Where they were starting to
get their proper sound together.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.000
It's not quite there,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.840
but you can hear the seeds of what
they became within it.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.680
And it has, famously, the track
The Knife.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.680
And I looked at the guitar
and I thought,

09:05.680 --> 09:09.320
"I haven't got a clue,
not a clue what comes next."

09:09.320 --> 09:13.560
And then I saw myself playing this
thing, but it was really scary.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.640
I eventually just sort of went
kerblonk really.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.120
I tried fighting through it,
but I didn't make it.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.600
Well, Anthony Phillips was
a fantastic musician,

09:25.600 --> 09:29.000
he was very much part of
the original collective.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.880
And when he left, it could have very
easily have been the end of Genesis.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.120
We wouldn't be having this
discussion,

09:34.120 --> 09:37.240
because they did very seriously
consider calling it a day.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.000
That was a very,
very significant loss.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I mean Ant leaving was far

09:41.000 --> 09:44.480
and away the most significant
moment in Genesis's history.

09:44.480 --> 09:45.880
People don't quite realise

09:45.880 --> 09:48.760
how important a character he was.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.560
I would say he was...

09:50.560 --> 09:53.600
very much the driving force.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.040
I felt it was the right thing to do.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.680
If I hadn't left they may never
have got Phil Collins.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.200
So, I mean...

10:01.560 --> 10:04.560
All I wanted to do was to be
able to play the drums

10:04.560 --> 10:06.520
and make enough money to live.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.160
It wouldn't be stardom or anything.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.280
I was a professional musician
in a semi-professional band.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.160
The band would have day jobs
and, you know, and we'd all meet up,

10:15.160 --> 10:18.200
but I was the one that was actually
existing on whatever we earned.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.920
Phil comes along, Dad's in insurance,

10:20.920 --> 10:24.480
he's a Hounslow boy, a good
West London boy, but he does bring

10:24.480 --> 10:27.960
some creativity with him
because Phil's mother, June,

10:27.960 --> 10:31.400
also worked with Barbara Speake
at the Barbara Speake Stage School.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.200
The first thing he did was bring
this incredibly direct

10:34.200 --> 10:36.760
and brilliant musical drumming.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.080
He can play anything.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.760
He can play your soul music,
your prog music, your jazz music,

10:41.760 --> 10:43.440
your fusion. He can play it.

10:43.440 --> 10:48.360
And he brought that incredible
confidence, I think, to their sound.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.480
You know, I was a stage-school kid,

10:50.480 --> 10:53.560
I was from a very different
background.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.960
I'd been playing music all my life,

10:55.960 --> 11:01.720
whereas music, to them...
was...a restricted subject.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.200
You know, I mean, you weren't
supposed to play

11:04.200 --> 11:05.600
guitar at Charterhouse.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.800
And they were kind of very precious,

11:10.800 --> 11:13.040
you know, it really mattered.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.440
You know, "You're playing what
kind of A chord?

11:15.440 --> 11:18.120
"No, no, that's not the best
inversion of the A."

11:18.120 --> 11:20.160
You know, I mean, things like that.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.440
It was just unbelievable.
The difference?

11:26.440 --> 11:28.280
I never ever, ever could have
imagined

11:28.280 --> 11:29.880
in a million years the difference

11:29.880 --> 11:31.920
a drummer could make.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.400
Oh, my God, he was...
It was unbelievable.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.280
He transformed the music.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.080
It was very apparent to us that he
was a really good drummer,

11:42.080 --> 11:44.400
you know, had a fantastic
sense of rhythm and stuff,

11:44.400 --> 11:46.440
which... We were all a bit stiff,
you know?

11:54.680 --> 11:57.720
He understood and felt things
and, you know,

11:57.720 --> 12:01.560
it was thank God for me that
I can talk to someone who actually

12:01.560 --> 12:03.720
knows the realities of life.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.680
And he had a lightness
as a personality too.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.320
He could joke and stuff
and everything, you know,

12:10.320 --> 12:13.200
much better than...
We were very intense.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.600
It was very incestuous.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.640
You know, we did nothing but this
so, obviously, you know,

12:18.640 --> 12:21.480
people got irritated with each
other.

12:23.120 --> 12:27.080
I remember storming out of...
when we were rehearsing one place,

12:27.080 --> 12:28.880
first time with Phil.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.440
You know, it just must have been
difficult for him I think.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.480
I was amazed he stayed.

12:32.480 --> 12:37.640
All this friction or
sort of tension that was under...

12:37.640 --> 12:42.360
you know, kind of under wraps
occasionally would boil over

12:42.360 --> 12:44.600
and someone would get up
and walk out.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.320
And I'd..."Did I miss something,
what happened?" You know?

12:47.320 --> 12:48.920
LAUGHTER

12:48.920 --> 12:51.200
And it would be like...
(MUMBLES) .."Fucking..."

12:51.200 --> 12:52.560
LAUGHTER

12:52.560 --> 12:53.960
Off into the distance.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.840
Because Phil like felt
a professional who'd played with

12:56.840 --> 13:00.480
other musicians and was just getting
on with the work, whereas we had all

13:00.480 --> 13:05.360
these intense, sort of, dysfunctional
family arguments going on.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.640
They discussed these things under
a sort of stifling cloak

13:08.640 --> 13:12.080
of British reserve, which is very
typical of the public schoolboy.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.880
And I imagine that the
workings of that band were quite

13:14.880 --> 13:16.520
mystifying to Collins.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.800
But I imagine he was
something of a breath of fresh air.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.640
It was always, you know,
beating each other into submission.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.680
But that was fun, I mean, I was
in a band, I was in a thinking band.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.760
You know, as far as I was concerned
it made a big change from what

13:29.760 --> 13:31.600
I'd, kind of, been playing.

13:31.600 --> 13:36.040
And that was the first time that it
felt like there was some chance

13:36.040 --> 13:40.720
of this combo gelling and delivering
something with a bit of punch.

13:40.720 --> 13:44.280
Things that had seemed really hard
work, you know, like pushing

13:44.280 --> 13:48.400
this big thing up a hill, suddenly
it was downhill and we could smile.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.120
When Steve Hackett joined it was
another kind of big

13:57.120 --> 13:59.760
moment in the Genesis story.
An absolutely stunning musician.

13:59.760 --> 14:02.040
He could make a guitar
sound like any instrument.

14:02.040 --> 14:06.360
It was really a little bit like
being thrown in at the deep end.

14:06.360 --> 14:12.680
I mean, I'd really been a legend
in my own bedroom at that point.

14:12.680 --> 14:16.520
Yes, I could play screaming solos
very, very quietly on this little

14:16.520 --> 14:21.720
radio that served as an amp, and
then suddenly to work with a band.

14:21.720 --> 14:25.200
And we all met him at Tony's flat.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.840
And he was very dark,

14:27.840 --> 14:30.880
but he always gave the impression
of being very serious, you know,

14:30.880 --> 14:33.760
with his black glasses, black hair.

14:33.760 --> 14:37.200
I sat down and played three
different styles of things

14:37.200 --> 14:39.840
to them, and I remember Pete
famously saying,

14:39.840 --> 14:43.680
"I think we can use the first style,
I'm not sure about the other two."

14:46.320 --> 14:47.800
We liked his approach.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.800
He was a very accomplished guitarist
without wanting to be

14:50.800 --> 14:53.920
a sort of flash guitarist at all,
you know?

14:53.920 --> 14:57.840
And he was interested in, sort of,
combinations and all the rest of it.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.040
Literally, and then there were five,

15:08.040 --> 15:10.960
and that really was the classic
band.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.520
And Steve just had -
he was just perfect.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.920
Nursery Cryme was when they began
to get a few sniffs at what

15:24.920 --> 15:26.520
they were doing.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.560
It went into - you know,
scraped into the Top 40,

15:28.560 --> 15:32.160
and you can hear the sound
coalescing, coming together there.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.960
But at the time, of course,
it was called progressive rock.

15:35.960 --> 15:39.320
Involved no limits, basically, no
barriers.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.960
So they were testing the barriers,

15:40.960 --> 15:43.880
learning how far they could push
this and realising that they

15:43.880 --> 15:47.160
could actually push it a lot further
than 4x4 beach music.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.920
Prog rock to... If you were trying
to explain it to an alien who'd

15:49.920 --> 15:53.760
just landed on Earth - I'd say songs
that last 20-minutes plus,

15:53.760 --> 15:57.000
have mythical allegories
and strange creatures in them,

15:57.000 --> 16:01.480
perhaps, you know, uniforms in the
case of Genesis and standing stones.

16:01.480 --> 16:05.040
There's something very, very
English about Genesis's music that,

16:05.040 --> 16:08.800
to me,
it's an England beyond psychedelia.

16:08.800 --> 16:13.440
# But I am lost
within this half-world

16:16.320 --> 16:20.080
# It hardly seems to matter now... #

16:21.600 --> 16:24.840
The guys were terrible at tuning
the 12 strings

16:24.840 --> 16:28.480
and they would take, sometimes,
five minutes between songs.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.560
Everyone looks at the singer...

16:33.000 --> 16:35.600
.."Entertain us," you know?

16:35.600 --> 16:44.680
So that's what I realised
I had to start doing.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.400
He's not particularly at ease
with an audience

16:48.400 --> 16:51.200
until he became someone else,
you know?

16:51.200 --> 16:53.680
The first time he ever wore
a costume was, obviously,

16:53.680 --> 16:56.320
the infamous time in Dublin
in the boxing ring.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.760
He hadn't told us about it,
which was just as well

16:58.760 --> 17:00.800
because we'd never have let him
do it.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.520
There's quite a long instrumental
passage in the middle

17:07.520 --> 17:09.720
and Peter went off.

17:09.720 --> 17:13.599
He certainly didn't tell Tony Banks
because I think, rightly,

17:13.599 --> 17:16.520
he thought that Tony would veto it.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.880
I was always afraid that these guys,
you know,

17:19.880 --> 17:24.960
would start arguing about any
of the visual costume bit that

17:24.960 --> 17:28.640
I was trying to do,
and so I would bring the stuff in.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.240
I'd smuggle it in.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.280
I'd smuggle it in as
late as possible,

17:32.280 --> 17:36.320
when they were so preoccupied with
getting everything else

17:36.320 --> 17:40.800
sorted, that I could sort of get away
with whatever shit was in my head!

17:45.360 --> 17:48.520
KATE MOSSMAN: Peter's impulse to
dress up in these elaborate clothes

17:48.520 --> 17:51.560
and his wife's dress with
a fox's head.

17:51.560 --> 17:52.800
I mean for him

17:52.800 --> 17:55.240
it was shyness, as I understand.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.640
I mean, he was a beautiful young
man,

17:57.640 --> 18:02.040
but he was not sexually confident
in the stagey way like Jagger was.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.160
And he wasn't even as sort
of committed to the

18:05.160 --> 18:07.880
personas as Bowie was at that point.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.520
So the likes of Bowie were doing it,

18:09.520 --> 18:12.080
the likes of Mark Bolan, you know,
the wearing of make-up,

18:12.080 --> 18:15.080
all that kind of stuff which didn't
go down well across the Atlantic.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.360
Americans - "What are
these Brits doing in frocks?"

18:17.360 --> 18:19.000
You know - "We don't want any of
that.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.680
"We want rock'n'roll. Rock'n'roll!"

18:20.680 --> 18:22.240
MUSIC: The Musical Box

18:22.240 --> 18:24.160
# I've been waiting here for so long

18:26.520 --> 18:31.360
# And all this time has passed me
by... #

18:31.360 --> 18:34.040
It was dark,
it was a sort of dark energy,

18:34.040 --> 18:36.960
and it was scary to people
and shocking.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.720
You know, he didn't run it
via the committee.

18:39.720 --> 18:42.360
He bullishly went ahead and did it.

18:42.360 --> 18:46.000
And if he hadn't, I suspect that
Genesis perhaps would not

18:46.000 --> 18:48.440
have gotten as far so quickly.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.960
CHEERING

18:55.960 --> 18:57.880
It brought the house down.

18:57.880 --> 19:00.760
It put a nought on the end
of our earnings.

19:00.760 --> 19:03.160
The costumes at that point

19:03.160 --> 19:04.720
were not intrusive.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.760
I mean, it kind of just seemed to be
part of what Genesis were,

19:07.760 --> 19:09.080
and I was all for it.

19:11.760 --> 19:15.440
I am the voice of Britain
before the Daily Express.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.080
My name is Britannia.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.080
Foxtrot, I think, is where most
Genesis fans agree that

19:38.080 --> 19:42.440
that's where they really broke the
roof and went to another dimension.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.720
It's one of those things where
you get popular

19:44.720 --> 19:47.240
and then by the time, you know, you
never really get it,

19:47.240 --> 19:49.600
you're sort of, "Oh, my God,
there's all that."

19:49.600 --> 19:52.680
And you get to that level and think,
"Oh, my God, there's all that."

19:52.680 --> 19:56.920
So, we didn't realise until we came
to New York, probably, just how

19:56.920 --> 20:01.960
VAST America was
and how much there was to do.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.680
American rock in the '70s was very,
very American,

20:14.680 --> 20:18.440
and the British rock that they liked
was working with American DNA,

20:18.440 --> 20:21.760
so they liked The Stones
because it was blues.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.600
So you had your, you know, your
Bob Seger and your Lynyrd Skynyrd

20:24.600 --> 20:27.360
and then you had your art rock,
your Iggy and Stooges

20:27.360 --> 20:29.200
and Velvet Underground.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.000
And, in a way,
it was a different language.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.120
It was quite a challenge, you know,
we were not downhearted by this.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.160
You know, we may be big over here,

20:39.160 --> 20:41.160
but over here you don't mean
anything.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.880
This was America, you know,

20:42.880 --> 20:45.960
this was the America that we'd all
heard about and read about.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.880
Just to stay in a Holiday Inn
we thought,

20:48.880 --> 20:52.760
"This is the Holiday Inn!" You know,
"This is a Holiday Inn!"

20:52.760 --> 20:55.360
Because they're famous rock'n'roll
hotels,

20:55.360 --> 20:57.640
you know,
people get banned from these.

20:57.640 --> 21:00.040
So it was all experience.

21:00.040 --> 21:02.040
And I can't remember ever feeling

21:02.040 --> 21:04.320
jaded by it or, like,
depressed by it.

21:24.840 --> 21:27.720
It was like we were touring America,
that's what you wanted to do.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.720
The initial tour which
I was responsible for, 18 cities,

21:30.720 --> 21:32.360
they were totally unknown.

21:32.360 --> 21:37.080
I essentially did something that
I never did before,

21:37.080 --> 21:41.280
for Genesis I had to lie.

21:41.280 --> 21:44.560
Everybody in your city knows
about Genesis because of imports,

21:44.560 --> 21:46.920
the thousands are coming in daily,

21:46.920 --> 21:49.040
and universally loved it, ah,

21:49.040 --> 21:51.280
it's underground, you can't see it.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.720
I can see it, but you can't.
But don't worry, they'll come.

21:56.320 --> 22:02.840
The first time I saw them, I noticed
that the audience seemed to

22:02.840 --> 22:08.840
be elevated, they were lifted
out of the mundane for a moment.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.760
I saw that.

22:10.760 --> 22:15.240
It was like a religious service,
it was very powerful, very palpable.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.880
I was moved along with the audience.

22:17.880 --> 22:21.720
Early Genesis followers,
early Genesis listeners,

22:21.720 --> 22:26.400
almost embraced them as, not a cult,

22:26.400 --> 22:32.520
but some kind of emotional religious
openness to freedom, because

22:32.520 --> 22:37.760
music still does, but especially
back then, it spoke to you.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.600
It touched a part of you.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.840
Particularly with Supper's Ready,
which is

22:41.840 --> 22:44.880
the 23-and-a-half-minute anthem,
which was then side two,

22:44.880 --> 22:49.160
which, I think, stands as the
definitive Genesis work of art.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.800
I can say no less.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.200
Yeah, there is
this sort of spiritual yearning

22:53.200 --> 22:57.040
going on through everything that
I do, and with Supper's Ready

22:57.040 --> 23:02.560
there was a powerful mood
in the audience sometimes that

23:02.560 --> 23:09.480
you just could harness and we could
convert very cynical people!

23:10.920 --> 23:14.160
# Walking across a sitting room

23:14.160 --> 23:18.200
# I turn the television off

23:18.200 --> 23:21.240
# Sitting beside you

23:21.240 --> 23:24.480
# I look into your eyes... #

23:24.480 --> 23:28.760
The opening part was a wonderful
Tony Banks' guitar piece.

23:28.760 --> 23:31.960
And because he doesn't play
guitar very much he chose a shape

23:31.960 --> 23:33.840
I would never have chosen, because

23:33.840 --> 23:36.080
it's just a weird...

23:36.080 --> 23:37.120
finger movement.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.720
A guitarist would never play that,
because you weren't a guitarist...

23:43.720 --> 23:45.600
I played it...
You never were a guitarist,

23:45.600 --> 23:47.840
get that straight. You played sort
of, you know...

23:47.840 --> 23:50.240
That first two or three
minutes of it was just

23:50.240 --> 23:52.560
a chord sequence I wrote,
but I knew it was going to have

23:52.560 --> 23:54.840
a melody on it, I wasn't worried
about that.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.400
I think when we first
started writing we were...

23:57.400 --> 24:00.240
This is going...
Knew it was going to get fucked up...

24:00.240 --> 24:01.840
LAUGHTER

24:03.920 --> 24:06.960
Tony was never short of a solo
or whatever,

24:06.960 --> 24:11.200
and I had always come in and start
wanting to put vocal things.

24:11.200 --> 24:15.680
So it was, sort of, really
decorating around what he did.

24:15.680 --> 24:18.920
And, you know, I think
we had a good partnership.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.760
# Lord of Lords

24:20.760 --> 24:22.760
# King of Kings

24:22.760 --> 24:24.400
# Has returned

24:24.400 --> 24:27.080
# To lead his children home

24:27.080 --> 24:34.200
# To take them to
the new Jerusalem... #

24:34.200 --> 24:40.240
When I sang "the new Jerusalem", I
was absolutely singing from my gut

24:40.240 --> 24:42.280
and I think people could feel that.

24:43.720 --> 24:50.120
Whether it was a sort of spiritual
goal destination, it's a...

24:50.120 --> 24:51.840
powerful word.

24:51.840 --> 24:55.320
And then you have Blake's Jerusalem

24:55.320 --> 24:57.960
and that history as well.

24:57.960 --> 25:01.400
So there was all of that
washed into it.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.160
I think when we got it right,
we had something that none of us

25:08.160 --> 25:10.520
could do on our own.

25:10.520 --> 25:14.720
And there were different musical
histories, you know,

25:14.720 --> 25:17.600
merging together in a powerful way.

25:23.320 --> 25:26.360
# I know what I Like

25:27.800 --> 25:32.480
# And I like what I know

25:34.080 --> 25:40.200
# Getting better
in your wardrobe... #

25:40.200 --> 25:42.480
For me, when Genesis actually
found their feet was

25:42.480 --> 25:45.080
when the tunes started to become
a little bit more robust.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.520
I mean, you can hear in Selling
England By The Pound,

25:47.520 --> 25:50.840
I Know What I Like,
that sounds like a good pop song.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.760
The structures are still proggy,

25:52.760 --> 25:56.240
they're still slightly overblown
and long and mad, in a sense,

25:56.240 --> 25:58.480
but the production is sharper,
that you...

25:58.480 --> 26:02.400
They needed to make
themselves slightly more palatable

26:02.400 --> 26:05.760
to the layman rather than
the prog fan and it worked.

26:13.880 --> 26:15.720
Peter had this idea and he was

26:15.720 --> 26:18.680
quite dogmatic that he wanted to do
this idea,

26:18.680 --> 26:21.040
and we thought,
"Well, you know, OK."

26:21.040 --> 26:23.760
But it meant him writing pretty much
all the lyrics as well.

26:23.760 --> 26:27.840
You know, if you really want to
define a world you have to

26:27.840 --> 26:31.000
let one person paint it.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.440
There weren't many novels
created by committee.

26:34.440 --> 26:38.920
The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway
was a complex beast in every way.

26:38.920 --> 26:42.120
It pretty much broke up the band
in terms of Gabriel leaving.

26:42.120 --> 26:44.680
He said there were autobiographical
elements in there,

26:44.680 --> 26:49.240
but then again there were bits
of dreams and bits of surrealism.

26:49.240 --> 26:54.320
We all were in thrall to bands
who could create a weirdness,

26:54.320 --> 26:56.440
an almost Monty Python-like

26:56.440 --> 26:59.640
side to music at that point.

26:59.640 --> 27:03.880
I remember thinking that the two
were almost together at that

27:03.880 --> 27:06.520
point in late '60s, early '70s
Britain.

27:09.320 --> 27:12.840
It's the one time Peter did all the
words himself, bar sort of one song.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.240
Maybe it had to be that
way, I think, actually.

27:15.240 --> 27:19.520
You couldn't have sort of shared the
words in the same way, in my mind.

27:19.520 --> 27:22.600
I'm sure Banks disagrees but I think
you probably couldn't have done.

27:22.600 --> 27:26.400
You know, I think the prime venom
was between Tony and I.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.280
It's a funny period for me.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.760
The Lamb was my least favourite
period during the whole

27:30.760 --> 27:33.200
of the time with the group,
basically because - mainly

27:33.200 --> 27:35.880
because there were problems with
Peter, I think, you know?

27:35.880 --> 27:38.600
You know, because we'd obviously
been very close up to that point

27:38.600 --> 27:41.280
and, sort of, things were going
a bit wrong and all the rest of it.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.720
He just didn't like me getting away
with too much, you know,

27:44.720 --> 27:47.080
or getting into
a controlling position.

27:47.080 --> 27:52.480
So there was, I think, wanting to
keep check on my power as well.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.320
I wasn't really that
excited by the story,

27:54.320 --> 27:56.680
I have to be honest about it,
I never have been.

27:56.680 --> 28:00.560
And that kind of was what the whole
thing was hanging on.

28:00.560 --> 28:01.800
MUSIC: In The Cage

28:01.800 --> 28:05.720
# I got sunshine in my stomach

28:05.720 --> 28:11.680
# Like I just rocked my baby
to sleep... #

28:11.680 --> 28:15.040
Peter was, you know,
he was flashing back and forth.

28:15.040 --> 28:20.280
You know, his birth of his daughter
was fairly traumatic.

28:20.280 --> 28:24.080
So, from his point of view
the writing was very slow.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.560
The problems
with my daughter's birth

28:26.560 --> 28:30.000
and the fact she was in an incubator
for a good amount of time that

28:30.000 --> 28:35.080
was absolutely number one for me,
there was nothing more important.

28:35.080 --> 28:39.440
And there was very little tolerance
and understanding for that.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.280
Meanwhile, the album was being
delayed and delayed

28:48.280 --> 28:51.000
and delayed and then the end result
being, of course, that

28:51.000 --> 28:53.680
the day the album came out was
the first show we did on the tour.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.040
The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,
I think,

29:01.040 --> 29:02.200
was a massively brave album

29:02.200 --> 29:05.600
to make. Hugely ambitious, you know,

29:05.600 --> 29:08.000
you can't fault
a band for being ambitious.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
Prime example of what not to do is
to go on tour with a new album

29:12.000 --> 29:16.120
not released and play
the entire double album live.

29:16.120 --> 29:19.840
Now, that was a risk,
bearing in mind this was a time

29:19.840 --> 29:22.440
they needed to be steadily
building their American audience,

29:22.440 --> 29:26.680
they decide to produce this
out-of-left-field concept album.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.480
MUSIC: The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway

29:28.480 --> 29:32.360
# And the lamb lies down

29:34.080 --> 29:37.440
# On Broadway... #

29:37.440 --> 29:39.480
To go from Selling
England By The Pound,

29:39.480 --> 29:42.720
to go from this English rural
atmosphere to, you know, the mean

29:42.720 --> 29:46.040
streets of New York I think it's
an incredibly brave album to make.

29:46.040 --> 29:49.400
It's an album
I will defend to the hilt.

29:49.400 --> 29:51.840
It is a sort of Pilgrim's Progress

29:51.840 --> 29:54.880
set on the streets of New York
for me.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.920
He was a punk character in a way,
Rael.

29:57.920 --> 30:03.440
It's a journey through which
he learns to destroy oneself,

30:03.440 --> 30:06.160
to open up the space for another.

30:10.560 --> 30:14.000
The Lamb was probably slightly
ahead of its time.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.640
They did it and, from what I know,

30:17.640 --> 30:20.880
the slides that they used on the
back projector failed regularly.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.160
They never quite got it right,
and yet they carried on doggedly -

30:24.160 --> 30:25.400
this will work.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.720
And although it was a troublesome
child, you know,

30:28.720 --> 30:32.240
with the visual side, you know,
I mean, a few nights it actually

30:32.240 --> 30:35.160
worked properly,
but most nights it didn't.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.400
# ..On Broadway

30:39.880 --> 30:43.040
# They say there's always
magic in the air

30:43.040 --> 30:45.680
# On Broadway... #

30:56.640 --> 30:58.720
What I remember about The Lamb

30:58.720 --> 31:01.720
was smoking a little joint
before I went on,

31:01.720 --> 31:07.800
and putting headphones on,
and playing in my own little world!

31:09.040 --> 31:13.320
And I just had a great time every
night, you know?

31:13.320 --> 31:14.960
It was great to play.

31:14.960 --> 31:20.640
# Making a crust
I cannot move in... #

31:20.640 --> 31:28.560
'The Lamb album was the best
we'd ever been on a record.'

31:29.880 --> 31:31.600
INSTRUMENTS KICK IN

31:39.880 --> 31:43.200
It was such a multimedia event
The Lamb,

31:43.200 --> 31:47.600
the screens, Pete's costumes,
the music.

31:47.600 --> 31:51.440
It was just an assault
on the senses, I think.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.280
The problem with The Lamb Lies Down
On Broadway was that

32:04.280 --> 32:07.160
when it was done live it was being
performed, you know,

32:07.160 --> 32:10.080
across North America to audiences
that had never heard it,

32:10.080 --> 32:13.440
that are sitting there going, "The
Knife?" And going, "What is this?

32:13.440 --> 32:17.280
"And why is Peter in a huge bobbly
suit, and what on earth is going on?"

32:18.920 --> 32:21.360
There was with the Slipperman
outfit,

32:21.360 --> 32:26.840
which had this sort of big head,
I couldn't hold the mic properly,

32:26.840 --> 32:30.200
and they didn't have these little
radio mics then,

32:30.200 --> 32:33.160
so you couldn't hear a word
I was singing

32:33.160 --> 32:34.640
when I was in that.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.800
# His skin's all covered in
slimy lumps... #

32:37.800 --> 32:40.280
But in a way, you know,
whenever sort of Spinal Tap

32:40.280 --> 32:42.720
is on or something and you see these
moments you think,

32:42.720 --> 32:44.960
"I've been in a band like that!"

32:44.960 --> 32:47.640
Where the pod didn't open, you know?

32:47.640 --> 32:49.720
That's Genesis!

32:49.720 --> 32:51.680
# ..My grip must be flipping

32:51.680 --> 32:53.600
# Cos his handshake
keeps slipping... #

32:53.600 --> 32:55.440
It was becoming increasingly
difficult,

32:55.440 --> 32:57.920
the way the band was perceived
was getting difficult,

32:57.920 --> 33:00.160
it was seen very much as Peter
and the band, you know,

33:00.160 --> 33:02.680
and that was kind of difficult
for all the rest of us because...

33:02.680 --> 33:05.000
I think it was creating some
jealousies.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.640
Yeah, of course it was, you know,
we were only in our early 20s

33:07.640 --> 33:10.080
and it was a difficult time that,
you know?

33:10.080 --> 33:12.960
And certainly people would
come in the dressing room...

33:12.960 --> 33:16.000
In America I remember the record
company guys, the local guys and

33:16.000 --> 33:19.160
the promoters would come and say,
"Yay, Pete, great show, great show,

33:19.160 --> 33:24.560
"when you put that mask on they
loved it, the kids loved it!"

33:24.560 --> 33:27.800
You know, I'm exaggerating, but it
would be that kind of thing.

33:27.800 --> 33:32.040
And it would be like "Hello,
you know, it's a band, you know?"

33:32.040 --> 33:35.360
And the music was first.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.520
It was a very difficult time,

33:37.520 --> 33:42.600
but I still feel that along with
Supper's Ready it's

33:42.600 --> 33:46.120
one of the things that I feel best
about from my time with Genesis.

33:46.120 --> 33:50.920
We were in a hotel in Cleveland
and Peter came to my room

33:50.920 --> 33:54.760
and said, "Look, I can't do this any
more, I'm at the end of this...

33:54.760 --> 33:56.640
"I'm leaving
at the end of the tour."

33:56.640 --> 33:59.560
MUSIC: The Carpet Crawlers

33:59.560 --> 34:04.160
# There's only one
direction in the faces that I see

34:05.360 --> 34:07.000
# It's upward... #

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
We had, I remember, a very long
conversation actually about it,

34:10.000 --> 34:12.800
but I knew that he was not -
he was not going to come back,

34:12.800 --> 34:14.920
it was as simple as that really.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.040
But we talked anyhow, really.

34:17.040 --> 34:19.800
"This is the band, man!" You know?
"What are you doing?"

34:19.800 --> 34:21.120
"This is..."

34:21.120 --> 34:25.960
It's... It felt a little bit cheated

34:25.960 --> 34:29.360
and let down by the fact that
someone's going to leave.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.840
For him one of the reasons,
apart from family reasons

34:32.840 --> 34:35.719
and everything else, is something
that I'm sure he'd felt he'd

34:35.719 --> 34:39.880
sort of got to a point that he'd,
sort of, moved on really.

34:39.880 --> 34:43.480
And then we kept it very quiet
right to the end of the tour.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.400
We didn't really make any
announcements

34:45.400 --> 34:47.280
until the end of the tour.

34:47.280 --> 34:51.480
I felt desperate to tell
the audience that I was going,

34:51.480 --> 34:57.320
and it felt like I was betraying
the people who were coming,

34:57.320 --> 35:01.320
who were paying to see us,
that I couldn't be myself

35:01.320 --> 35:05.440
and be real and be honest
and tell them what I was feeling.

35:05.440 --> 35:09.200
We all got quite
emotional at the last show.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.680
It was like talking about someone
dying, I suppose,

35:11.680 --> 35:14.000
but, I mean, no-one had prepared
themselves for this.

MUSIC: The Musical Box

35:27.800 --> 35:31.120
# It doesn't seem to matter now... #

35:32.880 --> 35:35.960
I remember thinking, "Oh, my God,
what are we going to do?"

35:47.040 --> 35:50.160
The British press, certainly,
sort of started to write Genesis's

35:50.160 --> 35:52.000
obituary when Peter left.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.280
We knew that we were
going to carry on,

35:54.280 --> 35:57.720
so I said, "Let's just do the whole
thing instrumentally, you know?"

35:57.720 --> 36:00.520
And it was like a cartoon,
it was like -

36:00.520 --> 36:02.960
"Well, let's just do the whole thing
instrumentally."

36:02.960 --> 36:04.680
"Shut up!"

36:04.680 --> 36:07.920
You know? "Are you mad,
are you crazy?

36:07.920 --> 36:12.080
"We write songs, they need to be
sung. Now, just shut up!"

36:12.080 --> 36:14.360
You know, that's the way
I felt it was.

36:14.360 --> 36:16.360
"Sorry, just a suggestion."

36:22.680 --> 36:26.440
We auditioned quite a few singers.

36:27.840 --> 36:32.640
And most of the time Phil would sing
the part to show them what they

36:32.640 --> 36:37.920
were singing and then they'd sing it
and it wouldn't be as good as Phil.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.960
I didn't want to not be the drummer.

36:39.960 --> 36:43.040
You know, this is what I did,
this is my territory!

36:43.040 --> 36:45.680
"I don't want to go,
don't push me out there, sir,

36:45.680 --> 36:47.640
"please don't take me out there,
don't send me

36:47.640 --> 36:50.080
"out there with a microphone."
I didn't want to do that.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.520
You know, it was a question really

36:51.520 --> 36:53.760
whether he wanted to do it more
than anything else.

36:53.760 --> 36:55.560
You know, we did,
as far as I can remember,

36:55.560 --> 36:57.000
we did revisit some of the tapes

36:57.000 --> 36:59.440
and thought, "Is there really
nobody that we've heard?"

36:59.440 --> 37:01.480
You know,
and we decided that there wasn't.

# And wept
as they led him away to a cage... #

37:24.200 --> 37:26.200
I think the big question mark was

37:26.200 --> 37:29.480
whether he could cut it on the more
rock,

37:29.480 --> 37:32.600
out and out rock stuff,
whether his voice was big enough.

37:32.600 --> 37:36.080
I remember nothing but good
vibes from the audience, you know.

37:36.080 --> 37:39.640
They wanted this to work. They
didn't compare with me with Pete.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.320
I was one of the guys in the band
coming forward.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.920
And I'd been there all along.

38:00.680 --> 38:03.840
I think I had more confidence
in the band being able to be

38:03.840 --> 38:06.760
successful than they did initially.

JOURNALIST: Last May the lead
vocalist

38:09.120 --> 38:10.920
of the British progressive
rock group,

Genesis, left the group.

38:12.360 --> 38:16.040
Now, when this happens a group either
breaks up or dies a very slow death.

38:16.040 --> 38:18.600
But because of the versatility
of each individual at Genesis

38:18.600 --> 38:20.160
they're doing very well.

38:20.160 --> 38:23.040
As a matter of fact, they seem to be
doing better than ever before.

38:23.040 --> 38:26.000
I believe it was your quote,
I am going to not give it verbatim,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.800
that it was like a very big
load off everybody

38:28.800 --> 38:30.640
when he finally did leave.
Is that true?

38:31.640 --> 38:33.720
Yeah. I mean...

38:33.720 --> 38:36.720
now it's paying off in a way.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.360
One feels better about it,

38:38.360 --> 38:40.800
because you've come
out from an underdog situation.

38:40.800 --> 38:45.280
The sad thing is that when someone
leaves, like Anthony and Peter,

38:45.280 --> 38:48.280
there's a sadness because, you know,
you'll never be as close again.

38:48.280 --> 38:49.960
You know, you stay in touch
and you see,

38:49.960 --> 38:54.080
but you lose that bond of sharing
things that I've had with Tony

38:54.080 --> 38:57.840
and Phil for the last, way
too many years.

38:59.200 --> 39:03.360
# Sail away, away

39:05.560 --> 39:06.800
# Ripples... #

39:06.800 --> 39:08.920
A lot of people compliment me
on A Trick Of The Tail

39:08.920 --> 39:11.320
when I wasn't actually there,
so it's...

39:11.320 --> 39:13.080
LAUGHTER
Reflected glory. Yeah.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.920
One of your finest moments.

39:14.920 --> 39:18.160
The band were much more successful
without me than they were with me.

39:20.400 --> 39:26.280
# ..Sail away, away... #

39:33.240 --> 39:35.040
After Pete left,

39:35.040 --> 39:38.920
two years later I was basically
doing the same thing myself.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.360
I feel uncomfortable talking about
it even now.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.360
I feel, you know,
if I reveal too much

39:43.360 --> 39:44.920
it's a man ratting on the regiment.

39:44.920 --> 39:47.440
I'm very grateful to the
regiment for everything it gave me.

39:52.280 --> 39:55.760
MIKE: He's a fantastic lead
guitarist.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.080
You hear one of those songs

39:57.080 --> 39:59.200
and it'll be absolutely unique,
you know?

39:59.200 --> 40:01.960
STEVE: In many ways it was such
a claustrophobic experience.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.960
Harder and harder to find relevant
things for the guitar to do,

40:04.960 --> 40:08.160
so, over time, I started to
amass solo material.

40:09.360 --> 40:13.320
God forgive me, guys, but I just
thought it's the only way to

40:13.320 --> 40:18.080
go to get ideas across is to just
negotiate with myself in the end.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.720
But there you are,
that's the way bands are.

40:20.720 --> 40:22.800
I think there was a certain
amount of, you know,

40:22.800 --> 40:24.960
who shouted the loudest
and got the most grumpy

40:24.960 --> 40:27.240
if their bit wasn't used, you know,
which would be me.

40:27.240 --> 40:28.640
Yeah, well, I mean I did probably

40:28.640 --> 40:31.120
get more on than other people,
you know, and that's...

40:31.120 --> 40:34.040
So, you've either got me
to blame or to love for the music.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.400
We then thought about getting
someone else in,

40:36.400 --> 40:38.640
but I think we felt that
the three of us had gone...

40:38.640 --> 40:41.480
we were so close at that point
in time, such a good working unit,

40:41.480 --> 40:44.280
that to bring a new person in -
I mean it could have worked,

40:44.280 --> 40:49.360
you know, but it wasn't quite
so... It wasn't imperative.

40:49.360 --> 40:57.720
# You, you have your own special way

40:59.720 --> 41:03.600
# Of holding my hand,
keep it way above the water

41:03.600 --> 41:05.120
# Don't ever let go... #

41:05.120 --> 41:08.480
By this point, the music business
had changed a great deal, which we

41:08.480 --> 41:11.320
hadn't sort of really been aware of,
still most of it escaped us because

41:11.320 --> 41:13.760
we were out in America most of this
time, but punk music

41:13.760 --> 41:16.600
had come in and a lot of the old
bands seemed to have disappeared.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.440
If Genesis were all of a sudden
going to start sounding

41:19.440 --> 41:25.120
like The Jam or Johnny Rotten I just
don't think it would have worked!

41:25.120 --> 41:27.360
MUSIC: Anarchy In The UK
by the Sex Pistols

41:27.360 --> 41:29.200
# Anarchy for the UK

41:29.200 --> 41:31.840
# It's coming sometime maybe... #

41:31.840 --> 41:35.080
I mean, the sound
of the Sex Pistols, I thought

41:35.080 --> 41:40.280
they had a fantastic sound,
it just sounded so...legitimate.

41:45.840 --> 41:50.080
So I kind of liked it, and then
I realised that we were the enemy,

41:50.080 --> 41:53.560
you know, we were the people
that they were trying to get rid of.

41:57.240 --> 42:00.080
We sort of seemed to go
through it regardless.

42:00.080 --> 42:01.440
In fact, we were lucky in a sense

42:01.440 --> 42:03.720
that all the opposition had
kind of been killed off.

42:03.720 --> 42:06.160
After Peter left, of course,
Phil came into his own

42:06.160 --> 42:07.640
and the hits started coming.

42:07.640 --> 42:12.440
Somehow, almost by chance,
Genesis redefined their sound,

42:12.440 --> 42:18.160
went for more compressed,
shorter numbers, a less florid sound

42:18.160 --> 42:22.200
and, sort of, almost by chance
started to have hit singles.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.480
MUSIC: Follow You Follow Me

42:24.480 --> 42:26.960
We were lucky with
And Then There Were Three,

42:26.960 --> 42:30.320
which proved to be, you know, our
most successful album at the time.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.760
Follow You Follow Me
actually being a single hit,

42:32.760 --> 42:35.200
first hit we really had, you know?

42:35.200 --> 42:38.240
# Stay with me

42:38.240 --> 42:40.200
# My love... #

42:40.200 --> 42:41.600
Follow You Follow Me

42:41.600 --> 42:44.360
must have just been an interesting
exercise for the band.

42:44.360 --> 42:46.800
You know, they probably set out
and thought,

42:46.800 --> 42:50.240
"Right, how do we write a hit?" And
suddenly, a band that was probably

42:50.240 --> 42:53.160
a predominantly male chin-stroking
audience was being played

42:53.160 --> 42:56.960
at the, you know, the slow dance at
the end of the Friday-night disco.

42:56.960 --> 43:00.600
Actually, Mike was the first one to
really write the love lyric,

43:00.600 --> 43:03.840
which was Follow You Follow Me which
doubled our audience overnight,

43:03.840 --> 43:06.080
suddenly
we were more female-friendly.

43:06.080 --> 43:07.760
# ..Alone with you

43:07.760 --> 43:09.800
# I will follow you

43:09.800 --> 43:12.200
# Will you follow me

43:12.200 --> 43:14.840
# All the days and nights

43:14.840 --> 43:17.640
# That we know will be?

43:17.640 --> 43:20.120
# I will stay with you

43:20.120 --> 43:22.720
# Will you stay with me?

43:22.720 --> 43:25.080
# Just one single tear

43:25.080 --> 43:27.200
# In each passing year... #

43:27.200 --> 43:28.600
I had never met Chester.

43:28.600 --> 43:30.800
You know, I had seen him
play with Weather Report.

43:30.800 --> 43:33.920
And there was a track that
I really liked,

43:33.920 --> 43:37.960
when he played with Zappa,
the Live At The Roxy album.

43:37.960 --> 43:42.800
And him and another drummer, I just
liked his playing on this one track.

43:42.800 --> 43:45.400
So I called him and I said, "Do you
want to join the band?"

43:45.400 --> 43:46.720
He said, "Well, yeah."

43:46.720 --> 43:48.960
And then I was saying,
"Man, I'm going

43:48.960 --> 43:52.200
"over to do rehearsals with this band
Genesis," and he gets this worried

43:52.200 --> 43:53.400
look on his face, says,

43:53.400 --> 43:55.880
"Man, are you
going to have to wear costumes?"

43:55.880 --> 43:58.920
And I thought, "Oh-oh,
what am I getting into here?!"

44:09.720 --> 44:13.760
What we were missing in the visual
department with Peter not

44:13.760 --> 44:18.000
being there and his costumes,
we suddenly had another facet,

44:18.000 --> 44:22.640
which was two drummers together,
one drummer, another drum...

44:22.640 --> 44:25.880
You know, it was mixing it up a bit.

44:25.880 --> 44:29.360
Well, I think
we traded off quite a lot, actually.

44:29.360 --> 44:31.600
I got a bit more of, I think,

44:31.600 --> 44:35.040
maybe the sort of his edge in my own
playing.

44:35.040 --> 44:39.120
And I like to think he got a little
funkier over the years, you know?

44:43.160 --> 44:46.840
CHEERING

44:46.840 --> 44:50.080
When I saw that Chester was going to
join I thought, "That's going

44:50.080 --> 44:51.880
"to be a pretty nice band to be in."

44:56.200 --> 44:57.880
Daryl can play anything, you know,

44:57.880 --> 45:00.640
he's an incredibly versatile
musician, a brilliant musician.

45:00.640 --> 45:02.760
We'll go back into the G
as a sort of...

45:02.760 --> 45:05.000
We have to get
the end of Firth Of Fifth, I mean,

45:05.000 --> 45:07.560
are we going to leave that till
another point?

45:07.560 --> 45:08.960
So he has to sort of fit into

45:08.960 --> 45:11.080
a certain style for the piece,
you know?

45:11.080 --> 45:13.840
And when we wrote Firth Of Fifth,
you know, and Steve, obviously,

45:13.840 --> 45:16.480
played a guitar solo on that, he was
quite a, you know, quite a

45:16.480 --> 45:19.960
stiff player, particularly in those
days, a certain kind of effect.

45:19.960 --> 45:21.560
I mean, it's very much a melodic
line

45:21.560 --> 45:23.600
you're playing with Firth Of Fifth,

45:23.600 --> 45:26.880
the main guitar solo and then you
improvise a little bit around it.

45:26.880 --> 45:28.880
MUSIC: Firth Of Fifth

45:46.520 --> 45:49.800
It turned into a very strong
moment, a stronger moment than

45:49.800 --> 45:52.440
we probably ever thought it was
going to be when we first did it.

45:52.440 --> 45:55.600
And I thought it would never work on
a guitar, but it just sounded great.

45:55.600 --> 45:59.440
To me, Genesis is a style already,
that it's not country,

45:59.440 --> 46:03.720
it's not rock, it's not jazz,
you know, it's Genesis.

46:03.720 --> 46:06.240
MUSIC: Deep In The Motherlode

46:06.240 --> 46:08.920
# All along the dusty trail

46:11.920 --> 46:14.480
# 17 years not over a day

46:16.000 --> 46:18.240
# Like children in the wild

46:18.240 --> 46:21.680
# Your mother's milk still wet on
your face... #

46:21.680 --> 46:24.760
ANNOUNCER: The road crew who had
travelled through the night start to

46:24.760 --> 46:28.520
unload five tonnes of equipment
from three giant trucks.

46:28.520 --> 46:31.640
Sound and lighting rigs are taken
into the theatre in preparation

46:31.640 --> 46:33.880
for the evening concert.

46:33.880 --> 46:36.320
CROWD CHEERING

46:51.360 --> 46:54.600
I've come here so early as to meet
the band. Get the autographs.

46:54.600 --> 46:55.960
Yeah, get the autographs.

46:55.960 --> 46:58.280
Got quite a few.
You can tell who the real fans are.

47:01.120 --> 47:03.120
OK, cheers.

47:03.120 --> 47:06.560
Yeah, I think Genesis cover
a wide range of musical taste.

47:06.560 --> 47:08.600
The earlier material as well.

47:08.600 --> 47:11.480
Yeah, which will appeal to far
more people than, say,

47:11.480 --> 47:12.880
just heavy metal bands.

47:12.880 --> 47:15.320
I mean, Genesis appeals to
basically everyone.

47:15.320 --> 47:17.040
JOURNALIST: What about your mates?

47:17.040 --> 47:19.160
I get a lot of slagging off
because of Genesis,

47:19.160 --> 47:20.880
they're not a vogue band to like.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.880
I have no idea what it's all about
when people say -

47:23.880 --> 47:26.920
"I listen to Genesis
but don't tell anyone."

47:26.920 --> 47:30.160
What is it all about?
I mean, I really don't know.

47:30.160 --> 47:35.240
It's melodic, it's inoffensive,
it's just good music.

47:35.240 --> 47:38.280
I don't know why there's
a stigma about Genesis.

47:38.280 --> 47:43.160
But I am happy to say that,
"I'm out, I'm out, I'm proud.

47:43.160 --> 47:45.520
"I'm not afraid if someone's..."

47:45.520 --> 47:48.400
I mean, I haven't had
to sit my family down over

47:48.400 --> 47:49.760
Sunday lunch and say,

47:49.760 --> 47:52.160
"I've something to tell you all -
I'm a Genesis fan."

47:52.160 --> 47:53.920
But I don't mind being -

47:53.920 --> 47:56.560
I don't mind the brickbats that
come with it.

47:56.560 --> 47:58.800
It's a bit a mystery,
I don't know what the problem is.

47:58.800 --> 48:03.040
It's an entrenched view in British
rock appreciation that

48:03.040 --> 48:06.200
when the hits start coming
the band's gone off the boil.

48:13.120 --> 48:16.040
# All I need is a TV show

48:16.040 --> 48:18.680
# That and the radio

48:18.680 --> 48:21.960
# Down on my luck again

48:21.960 --> 48:25.000
# Down on my luck again

48:25.000 --> 48:26.800
# I can show you

48:26.800 --> 48:28.680
# I can show you

48:28.680 --> 48:32.280
# Some of the people in my life

48:32.280 --> 48:35.880
# I can show you I can show you

48:35.880 --> 48:40.040
# Some of the people in my life

48:40.040 --> 48:43.040
# It's driving me mad

48:43.040 --> 48:45.960
# Just another way
of passing the day

48:50.440 --> 48:56.080
# I, I get so lonely
when she's not there... #

48:56.080 --> 48:58.320
The post-Gabriel albums,
certainly the first three or

48:58.320 --> 49:01.160
four, are perhaps better than
they're given credit for.

49:01.160 --> 49:04.400
And then by the time of Duke
they were getting - starting to

49:04.400 --> 49:08.480
get the next level of sound,
which was more stadium-friendly.

49:08.480 --> 49:11.600
When we did Duke, which is probably
my favourite album in many ways,

49:11.600 --> 49:14.360
my personal favourite track
on the album, and also one that

49:14.360 --> 49:17.720
I suppose is shorter, although it's
quite long, is Duchess, which sort

49:17.720 --> 49:20.240
of starts in a very sort
of loose kind of way and then builds

49:20.240 --> 49:23.600
to a very concise pop song and then
goes meandering again at the end.

49:23.600 --> 49:26.160
It's one of my favourite tracks
we ever did.

49:26.160 --> 49:29.160
# Times were good

49:29.160 --> 49:33.360
# She never thought about the future

49:33.360 --> 49:36.680
# She just did what she would

49:36.680 --> 49:40.880
# Oh, but she really cared

49:40.880 --> 49:44.200
# About her music

49:44.200 --> 49:47.240
# It all seemed so important
then... #

49:51.640 --> 49:55.280
When my marriage broke up
I had an empty house.

49:55.280 --> 49:59.480
I just used to go down the pub,
and I kind of lived there.

49:59.480 --> 50:02.000
It became my social life.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.120
And I would go home and I'd start
thrashing around on a piano

50:05.120 --> 50:07.360
and start writing songs, some of..

50:07.360 --> 50:10.200
you know, some of them
were pretty sad.

50:10.200 --> 50:12.080
# Oh, I cry a bit

50:12.080 --> 50:14.480
# I don't sleep too good

50:14.480 --> 50:17.120
# But I'm fine... #

50:17.120 --> 50:19.640
Please Don't Ask was probably
the most personal song

50:19.640 --> 50:22.600
I'd ever written, and this was me
really...

50:24.400 --> 50:26.880
..baring my soul, if you like.

50:29.400 --> 50:33.000
# ..When can I touch you

50:33.000 --> 50:34.960
# Again and again... #

50:34.960 --> 50:36.800
And very, very personal.

50:36.800 --> 50:40.680
And, you know, it was strange,
I found myself thinking,

50:40.680 --> 50:45.280
"What am I doing singing this song
on a Genesis record, this is..."

50:45.280 --> 50:50.600
Because I know the people that buy
Genesis's record aren't really...

50:50.600 --> 50:53.280
they're not going to be
touched by this.

50:53.280 --> 50:56.600
But I don't think he'd written
a really particularly good lyric

50:56.600 --> 50:59.000
until he found his voice,
which was really after, you know,

50:59.000 --> 51:01.200
obviously, his marriage break-up
and everything

51:01.200 --> 51:03.840
and he had time on his own,
he started writing these songs.

51:03.840 --> 51:06.280
I played this stuff to
Mike and Tony.

51:06.280 --> 51:10.040
I said, "This is what I've been
doing, pick whatever you want."

51:10.040 --> 51:12.400
We really liked Please Don't Ask.

51:12.400 --> 51:15.200
He played that to us,
a few others like that he played.

51:17.560 --> 51:19.040
And, at the time, if we'd said,

51:19.040 --> 51:21.520
"We want to do all of them,"
he would have said, "OK."

51:21.520 --> 51:23.240
That was kind of, how it was really,

51:23.240 --> 51:25.200
you know, everything went into
the pot.

51:25.200 --> 51:26.800
A question of choosing
one other song.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.840
Misunderstanding,
we knew we were going to do,

51:28.840 --> 51:30.520
we'd heard that a lot,
liked it very much.

51:35.120 --> 51:38.560
# There must be
some misunderstanding

51:38.560 --> 51:42.640
# There must be
some kind of mistake... #

51:44.680 --> 51:47.520
Now, one of the extraordinary
and unique things about the band,

51:47.520 --> 51:50.560
and this is probably also
why they've survived so long,

51:50.560 --> 51:53.600
is that all the members
of the classic line-up have managed

51:53.600 --> 51:56.240
to follow solo careers
and yet still work together.

52:02.160 --> 52:05.120
I think the thing that's always
overlooked is what an amazing

52:05.120 --> 52:07.200
singer Gabriel was and is.

52:07.200 --> 52:09.240
His voice was always
incredibly special.

52:09.240 --> 52:10.680
His first album,

52:10.680 --> 52:13.880
the first Peter Gabriel album was
really interesting.

52:13.880 --> 52:16.520
There's, you know, suddenly a hit
single - Solsbury Hill,

52:16.520 --> 52:18.600
you know, the last thing you
would have imagined.

52:25.480 --> 52:28.760
# Climbing up on Solsbury Hill

52:28.760 --> 52:32.440
# I could see the city light

52:32.440 --> 52:36.240
# Wind was blowing
Time stood still

52:36.240 --> 52:39.240
# Eagle flew out of the night... #

52:39.240 --> 52:44.600
Solsbury Hill is a song of
absolute liberation. It's uplifting.

52:44.600 --> 52:46.840
It's almost like word paint
in a way, it climbs up,

52:46.840 --> 52:49.480
the idea of the expanse
that he's looking over

52:49.480 --> 52:52.800
and the potential
of what the future could be.

52:52.800 --> 52:56.560
I think it's a masterpiece
of elation, that record.

52:57.880 --> 53:01.480
# ..I just had to trust imagination

53:01.480 --> 53:04.920
# My heart going boom, boom, boom

53:04.920 --> 53:06.840
# "Son," he said

53:06.840 --> 53:11.200
# "Grab your things
I've come to take you home." #

MUSIC: The South Bank Show Theme
by Julian Lloyd Webber

53:15.680 --> 53:18.600
Hello. Peter Gabriel made his name
in the rock world in the early

53:18.600 --> 53:22.760
'70s as a singer-songwriter and
often wildly-theatrical performer

53:22.760 --> 53:24.720
with the rock band Genesis.

53:24.720 --> 53:26.200
He left them in 1975,

53:26.200 --> 53:27.960
and since then he's built a new

53:27.960 --> 53:31.280
reputation as a thoughtful solo
artist who takes immense

53:31.280 --> 53:34.440
care in writing
and producing his own material.

53:34.440 --> 53:37.400
His highly acclaimed third album
placed him at the forefront

53:37.400 --> 53:39.960
of one of the most significant
recent developments in rock,

53:39.960 --> 53:41.680
the increasing use of synthesisers

53:41.680 --> 53:43.840
and sophisticated electronic
technology.

53:43.840 --> 53:46.080
MUSIC: Games Without Frontiers

53:46.080 --> 53:48.440
# Hans plays with Lotte

53:48.440 --> 53:50.600
# Lotte plays with Jane

53:50.600 --> 53:53.080
# Jane plays with Willi... #

53:53.080 --> 53:57.120
Peter didn't have a band
around the time of the third album

53:57.120 --> 53:59.960
and so I said, "Well,
I'm doing nothing,"

53:59.960 --> 54:05.200
because I'd been through my great
sorrow, so I volunteered my services

54:05.200 --> 54:07.760
as a drummer, and Peter said,

54:07.760 --> 54:11.320
"I don't want any cymbals, I don't
want any cymbals on this."

54:11.320 --> 54:15.000
And for a drummer that was... You
know, that was a big deal, you know?

54:15.000 --> 54:18.160
"Oh, hang on, well, what's this hand
supposed to do?"

54:18.160 --> 54:20.880
So we set up the drums
so that there was a drum instead

54:20.880 --> 54:24.640
of a cymbal in that particular
position in case I had the urge.

54:24.640 --> 54:26.400
LAUGHTER
You know, it was like...

54:28.600 --> 54:34.880
Peter Gabriel's album was a dream
come true for a recording engineer,

54:34.880 --> 54:37.520
because we were doing, you know,

54:37.520 --> 54:41.600
so much sort of experimentation
with sound.

54:41.600 --> 54:43.600
Just the wind in the pipe is quite
nice.

54:43.600 --> 54:46.440
You think? Yeah. 'It was just great
fun, you know.'

54:48.480 --> 54:50.120
DRUMBEAT PLAYS

54:50.120 --> 54:55.760
So this is Intruder and it
starts off with the drum pattern.

54:55.760 --> 54:58.800
I asked Phil to do a really
simple pattern there,

54:58.800 --> 55:02.760
and it just sounded
like the future of drums.

55:07.560 --> 55:11.240
I was so blown away that
I wanted to strip everything

55:11.240 --> 55:17.760
back off the track and have this be
the absolute centre of it.

55:20.160 --> 55:21.520
Mr Padgham...

55:23.840 --> 55:27.280
Because Hugh Padgham
was the engineer,

55:27.280 --> 55:31.760
the man with the hands on, that's
the reason why I befriended him

55:31.760 --> 55:34.680
and thought he'd be the man
to make my first album.

55:34.680 --> 55:37.720
And I think all creative people,
in the end, are just like dogs

55:37.720 --> 55:40.440
in the park, you know,
you sniff something interesting

55:40.440 --> 55:43.360
and you try and jump on it.
And, you know...

55:43.360 --> 55:44.960
Speak for yourself.

55:44.960 --> 55:47.400
We've always
been like that I think, you know.

55:47.400 --> 55:49.880
You can always tell where we've
been sniffing. Yeah.

55:49.880 --> 55:51.480
LAUGHTER

55:51.480 --> 55:57.120
At a very early stage I established
a principle that the two,

55:57.120 --> 55:58.840
the solo careers

55:58.840 --> 56:03.440
and the Genesis career were always
maintained as very separate things.

56:03.440 --> 56:05.080
We never mixed them.

56:05.080 --> 56:07.320
There was never a time when we said,

56:07.320 --> 56:11.040
"Oh, let's do a Phil Collins song
on a Genesis show," or vice versa.

56:11.040 --> 56:14.680
We always kept the two things
very separate.

56:14.680 --> 56:17.880
I think Phil went off to
do this own thing

56:17.880 --> 56:21.120
because it was very clear that that
career was there for him.

56:21.120 --> 56:24.280
He was probably the last of the band
to make a solo album.

56:24.280 --> 56:27.200
I mean, actually, they had all
gone off and done other things.

56:27.200 --> 56:29.440
He just went off
and did it rather more publicly

56:29.440 --> 56:31.640
because he was a huge success at it.

56:33.320 --> 56:38.400
# I can feel it coming
in the air tonight

56:39.520 --> 56:41.520
# Oh, Lord

56:43.040 --> 56:48.960
# And I've been waiting for
this moment for all my life

56:48.960 --> 56:51.200
# Oh, Lord

56:53.240 --> 56:57.360
# Can you feel it coming in the air
tonight... #

56:57.360 --> 56:59.720
I think it was probably a very
good thing we didn't do it.

56:59.720 --> 57:02.360
If Genesis had done it, I
think we'd have complicated it up.

57:02.360 --> 57:04.400
But, of course,
that's its whole charm,

57:04.400 --> 57:07.640
it's what works about it, is the
fact that it's so repetitive.

57:09.320 --> 57:15.360
# ..I can feel it
coming in the air tonight

57:15.360 --> 57:17.600
# Oh, Lord... #

57:19.200 --> 57:22.440
I'm glad, you know,
I'm glad we didn't use it because,

57:22.440 --> 57:26.520
obviously, I was left to my own
devices on most of the material.

57:27.960 --> 57:30.800
It's down in history now that
Tony Banks claims that

57:30.800 --> 57:33.720
I didn't play him
In The Air Tonight, but I did.

57:33.720 --> 57:35.440
And he didn't play
In The Air Tonight.

57:35.440 --> 57:37.800
It doesn't matter
what anybody tells you.

57:37.800 --> 57:40.960
I don't remember the moment
when I played In The Air Tonight.

57:40.960 --> 57:43.600
I just was very proud of it,
so I don't understand why

57:43.600 --> 57:46.840
I would not have done,
because at that point I hadn't

57:46.840 --> 57:51.120
made my record, so I didn't know how
good or bad it was going to be.

57:51.120 --> 57:53.760
Phil Collins, when he started
writing about the break-up

57:53.760 --> 57:56.880
of his marriage and these love
songs, initially on his solo career,

57:56.880 --> 58:00.120
but there was obviously a cross-over
between the songs he was writing

58:00.120 --> 58:03.400
for both parties, it did introduce
an element of confessional.

58:03.400 --> 58:06.720
# How can I just let you walk away

58:06.720 --> 58:10.920
# Just let you leave without a
trace... #

58:10.920 --> 58:13.880
I think what Collins did in terms
of channelling those emotions

58:13.880 --> 58:16.880
in terms of what had happened in his
personal life into his music,

58:16.880 --> 58:20.520
was something that the band had
never done, as far as we were aware.

58:20.520 --> 58:23.400
He was very, very emotional,
something,

58:23.400 --> 58:27.640
if I may say, that we British tend
not to show emotion so much, do we?

58:27.640 --> 58:29.280
You know, the old stiff upper lip.

58:29.280 --> 58:33.960
In a way, he's the master
of the romcom romance, isn't he?

58:33.960 --> 58:35.880
These are extremely emotional songs.

58:35.880 --> 58:38.240
All through the
'80s, growing up, I thought of him

58:38.240 --> 58:41.080
as the guy playing the piano with
the pot of paint on it,

58:41.080 --> 58:45.560
you know, the sort of,
the heartbreaking plaintive ballads.

58:45.560 --> 58:48.000
# ..Now take a look at me now

58:49.200 --> 58:52.440
# Cos there's just an empty space

58:54.160 --> 58:58.160
# But to wait for you
is all I can do

58:58.160 --> 59:01.360
# And that's what I've got to face

59:01.360 --> 59:04.880
# Take a good look at me now... #

59:06.160 --> 59:09.120
We are unique in the fact that
I can't think of any other band

59:09.120 --> 59:13.200
who's done this
solo/main band career

59:13.200 --> 59:15.600
and run it for many years
afterwards, you know?

59:15.600 --> 59:18.440
We always felt that whatever
we were doing is the main

59:18.440 --> 59:20.880
thing at the time, the band or solo.

59:20.880 --> 59:23.960
But it wasn't like, if you're doing
that you can't do that, you know?

59:23.960 --> 59:26.640
And I'm sure it helped us
keep going, actually, the variety

59:26.640 --> 59:32.080
of work and music was, I think,
gave us a freshness as a main band.

59:40.920 --> 59:42.920
# Look up on the wall

59:44.480 --> 59:46.480
# There on the floor

59:48.520 --> 59:50.360
# Under the pillow

59:51.760 --> 59:53.840
# Behind the door... #

59:55.160 --> 59:58.840
I know people who picked up on us
on, say, Abacab or something

59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.520
and think that's the best album,
you know?

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.160
We always liked to throw in a bit
more sort of thinking kind of music

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.800
in there, did long songs
and tried to do a few things

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.720
that were slightly more, you know,

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.880
slightly less predictable,
if you like.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.280
# I didn't, I didn't

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.160
# I didn't do it, uh-ow!

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.760
# I didn't, I didn't

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.600
# I didn't do it, uh-uh-ah

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.200
# I didn't, I didn't

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.960
# I didn't do it, guv, honest

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.840
# I didn't, I didn't

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.600
# I didn't do it, I didn't

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.960
# I didn't, I didn't do it... #

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.400
Another record that was really
big at the time

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:37.680
was Grandmaster Flash
and it was called "The Message",

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.560
and it had this sort of
"hoo-hoo-ha-ha-ha-ha"

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.360
sort of laugh in it.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.840
# Don't push me cos
I'm close to the edge

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.480
# I'm trying not to lose my head

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.000
# Ha-ha, ha-ha! #

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.440
Ha-ha, ha!

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.760
# Ha-ha, ha-ha! #

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.560
And we all thought, "That's
fantastic," you know? That laugh.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.040
What a fantastic idea to have
on a record, a laugh, you know?

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.800
I mean not since
The Laughing Policeman

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.680
was there such a laugh on a record.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.280
And I just started going, "Ha-ha-ha.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.240
"Ha-ha-ha!" And everyone would
kind of, you know,

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.080
we were playing, and sort of looked
and laughed and smiled,

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.160
but I knew that it wasn't getting a
grimace, it was getting a smile,

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.520
you know? So I thought, "OK,
well, I'll remember that."

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.320
And the lyrics of Mama
were improvised.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.760
I was kind of,
that's my kind of Lennon.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.280
HE HUMS MELODY

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:43.080
Lennon sort of influence, kind
of with the echo, Be-Bop-A-Lula.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.120
It was just kind of compression.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.440
It sounded a bit like a Lennon song.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.600
# I can't see you, Mama... #

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.840
You had to sort of sneer a bit
when you were singing it.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.520
# I can't see you, Mama

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:03.600
# But I can hardly wait... #

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:08.800
# But I can hardly wait

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.480
# Ooh, to touch... #

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.040
Ha-ha, ha-ha. Oh...

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.520
In all the years, no-one
ever asked, "Why the laugh?"

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:21.280
Because I thought that people
would be surprised, you know?

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.520
Genesis. Grandmaster Flash.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.040
Surely not?

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.720
MUSIC: That's All

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.960
# Just as I thought
it was going all right

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.720
# I found out I'm wrong
when I thought I was right

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.040
# S'always the same

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.640
# It's just a shame, that's all

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.760
# I could say day
and you'd say night

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.560
# Tell me it's black
when I know that it's white

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.600
# Always the same

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.920
# It's just a shame
and that's all... #

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.800
The albums that became
huge in America and Britain,

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.320
they're concise, they're effective.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.160
For me, they're a little clinical
but effective.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:10.240
The soul and art rock, if you will,
of the previous albums

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.880
has been side-lined.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.280
They're more like a well-oiled
machine by that point.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.320
# ..If I knew you were looking at me
It's always the same

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.000
# It's just a shame, that's all. #

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.200
Stick at a thing for long enough,
you know?

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.000
No, I loved it.
It was great having hits.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.040
You know, I'd been brought up
in the era of hits.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.920
In the '60s, you know,
the next Beatles song coming out

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.600
was the sort of high point
of my existence, really,

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.440
and all this stuff, you know?
So hits for me were, you know,

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.080
I loved hits. And to suddenly
have records in the charts,

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.480
having your record... I mean
it's still a thrill for me now

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.840
to hear a record on the radio.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:47.200
Right now, for the very first time
on Top Of The Pops, it's Genesis.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.000
MUSIC: Turn It On Again

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.880
Less obvious hits like
Turn It On Again and Mama,

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.040
neither of which are very totally
straightforward pop songs,

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.960
were able to be hits because we were
kind of, we were accepted now,

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.440
we could be played on Radio One,
whereas in the old days

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.280
we could only be played on sort of
deepest, darkest sort of something.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.520
# All I need is a TV show

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.760
# That and the radio... #

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.800
Hi, I'm Phil Collins.
I'm Mike Rutherford.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.280
And I'm Tony Banks. Of Genesis,

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.640
and you're watching MTV,

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.920
the world's first all day/all night
video music channel.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.320
TOGETHER: In stereo.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.640
This MTV thing meant that a hit song
was so high-profile

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.280
that it was on every bar, every
restaurant all round the world.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:52.000
MUSIC: Invisible Touch

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.720
Once it got to Invisible Touch
and we had, you know,

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.560
in America we had

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.600
a number one single suddenly, you
know. Extraordinary.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.200
And, you know, half a dozen songs
off that album,

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.480
because the way America calculated
charts

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.520
was on radio play
as much as on sales,

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.160
and we were played everywhere, so we
had all these songs that were hits.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.600
# ..Nothing could go wrong

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.240
# Now I know... #

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.240
Right now, ladies
and gentlemen, Genesis.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.720
Genesis!

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.040
The almost all-Genesis weekend.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.200
Start by casting your vote
in the next round

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.440
of the Friday night video clash.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.080
# ..She seems to have
an invisible touch, yeah

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.400
# She reaches in
and grabs right hold of your heart

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.960
# She seems to have
an invisible touch, yeah

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:47.160
# It takes control
and slowly tears you apart

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.080
# Well, I don't really know her

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.760
# I only know her name

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.560
# Ooh
but she crawls under your skin

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.560
# You're never quite the same

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.920
# And now I know

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.360
# She's got something
you just can't trust

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.720
# And it's something mysterious

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.240
# And now it seems, I'm falling

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.080
# Falling for her. #

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.800
# I want to be

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.760
# Your sledgehammer

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.640
# Why don't you call my name?

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.280
# Ha

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.040
# You better call
the sledgehammer... #

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.440
The impact of MTV was enormously
influential

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.640
for Genesis and for Peter Gabriel.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.280
They were always a very theatrical
band but, of course,

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.400
to very limited audiences
of a few thousand here

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.960
and 20,000 there, or whatever.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:50.000
To suddenly be able to channel
those theatrical impulses

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.880
into video on MTV
changed their fortunes for ever.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.800
MTV brings you Genesis tonight.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.920
10pm Eastern, 9pm Central.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.080
7pm Pacific.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:04.520
I think the solo careers
of Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.080
are always going to be over-shadowed
by those of Collins and Gabriel,

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.720
because they were the vocalists and,
you know, as is always the case.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.120
I actually thought about
doing a solo album

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.800
before Trick Of The Tail,
so I did it and, you know,

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.520
I wrote A Curious Feeling.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:26.040
# It sure felt good for a while... #

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.400
I was obviously hoping for more
success than it had,

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.000
I have to be honest about it,
really.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.960
But it did make the top 20,
so, you know, it can't be too bad.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.560
# Do what you want

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.960
# Do what you want
You've got to... #

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.240
So I did a load of those albums,
you know,

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.480
I did about half a dozen albums,
five albums, I think, solo albums.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.160
But then the idea came, perhaps
just before I concede,

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.600
I should have a go at doing stuff
with an orchestra,

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.080
and I wrote a couple
of pieces that I thought would work

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.240
really well with an orchestra.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.600
And, you know, I actually got some
quite good reviews

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.320
from the classical people, even.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.040
You know, I mean most of them were
sort of, you know, don't want

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.120
to know about rock guys doing
classical music,

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.479
it's somehow beyond the pale.

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:18.760
But it was, it got some good
reviews.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.600
Actually it sold quite well,

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.000
far better than anything
I'd done before.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:32.399
# I said go if you want to go

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:35.160
# Stay if you want to stay

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.080
# I didn't care if you hung around me

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.200
# I didn't care if you went away... #

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.279
In order to be a solo artist,
you have to be a singer.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:48.640
Without that, it's a bit tough,
as I found out.

01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:53.080
If you write a good song,
you want a great voice

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.720
and that great voice isn't me.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:58.000
# ..All I need is a miracle

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.319
# All I need is you

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.080
# All I need is a miracle

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.120
# All I need is you... #

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:11.439
The fastest rising hit in Britain
and the States,

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:14.840
written by Scotland's BA Robertson
and Mike Rutherford of Genesis.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.279
It's called The Living Years
from Mike and the Mechanics.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:23.359
# Say it, say it, say it loud

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.600
# Say it clear

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.439
# Oh, say it clear

01:09:28.439 --> 01:09:35.359
# You can listen as well
as you hear... #

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.680
I find the act of collaboration
the exciting part.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.279
You're sort of, you're feeding
off what the other person's doing.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:46.120
# Looking back

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.359
# Over my shoulder

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:51.279
# I can see

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:54.640
# That look in your eye... #

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:04.000
I would have always probably carried
on co-writing, because I like that.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:08.880
I was being given fantastic
opportunities, if you like,

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.080
and I just think, "Yeah, how can
I say no to that, you know?

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.160
"Because maybe I won't get asked
again, I should do that,

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.600
"it'll be great fun, you know?"
Whereas in fact you end up

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.840
being everywhere and in people's
faces the whole time.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.880
# You can't hurry love

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.520
# No, you'll just have to wait

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:27.160
# She said don't love come easy

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.800
# It's a game of give and take... #

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.960
Ladies and gentlemen, Phil Collins.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:38.000
Congratulations on the five Emmy
Awards.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.520
Yes, the Grammys, yeah.
Grammys, right.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.640
# ..How many heartaches must I stand

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:49.400
# Before I find a love
to let me live again... #

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.000
So how about the fellas in Genesis,
are they furious?

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.600
Oh, no, no, no, no.
They're spitting blood I heard.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.680
The rumour in the music press
is they're spitting blood.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.880
I mean, it was great for him,
you know,

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.400
he was our friend, we wanted him
to do well but, you know,

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.400
we didn't want him to do that well,
not initially.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.000
But, you know, it was the thing
and it kind of never went away.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.320
# ..No, you'll just have to wait

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:16.720
# She said love don't come easy

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.560
# It's a game of give and take... #

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.600
He was ubiquitous for about 15
years, you know?

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.800
You couldn't get away from him,
it was a nightmare.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.280
# You'll be in my heart

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:32.560
# No matter what they say

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.840
# You'll be here in my heart

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.560
# Always... #

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.520
Peter's music changed once
he left Genesis,

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.440
because he wasn't under
the Genesis umbrella.

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.400
Now it's true, of course,
that all the members of Genesis

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:52.680
were having hits, but it was Peter
who was the one becoming more

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:56.280
and more involved in politics
and political causes.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.160
I think the stuff Peter Gabriel
has done politically

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.760
is enormously important.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.720
And I think he was always
ahead of the curve.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.040
You know, he always kind of knew
what was going on.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.440
I mean, songs that I know people
probably get sick to death

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.960
of people banging on about,
songs like Biko and stuff,

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.800
but, you know,
nobody else was doing it.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:17.960
A man who was imprisoned, tortured
and killed in a jail in South Africa.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.320
This is for Stephen Biko.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:25.480
Biko's death may have done more
damage to South Africa's image

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:29.800
abroad than he could have achieved
alive with 1,000 speeches.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:33.440
Why were you drawn at the time
to write a song about Biko?

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.640
I think it was a tremendous shock
because I think no-one...

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.400
There'd been a certain amount
of publicity about his arrest

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.920
and no-one was expecting him
to be killed.

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:46.480
# The outside world
is black and white

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.400
# With only one colour dead

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.600
# Oh, Biko

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:59.520
# Biko, because Biko... #

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.440
I think had he been allowed to live
he could have been

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:06.200
a great African statesman, perhaps
sort of crystallised the hopes

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.240
of a lot of young people in the way
that Kennedy did in America.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.320
And I think it's tragic
the way, you know,

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.960
he was, his life was cut short.

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:30.160
We'd dreamt of having our own studio
for years, you know, because going

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.000
to these holes in the ground in sort
of, first of all, in London

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.440
and stuff, we just thought it would
be so nice, and then you could

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.880
actually sort of write and record

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.880
in the same place
with no time pressures.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.960
Invisible Touch
was the first album we did here.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.960
And when we got here it was
fantastic.

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.400
And the key thing was
being able to sort of focus,

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.680
because otherwise you have to write
an album, rehearse it quite well

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.040
and then go and record it.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.680
So you'd already sort of decided
how it was going to sound,

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.480
whereas, because we owned the place,
we could sort of write

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.800
and almost record at the same time
and mess around.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.040
It just it made the whole thing a
lot freer and I think better for us.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.720
# She don't like losing

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:09.000
# To her it's just a game

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.120
# And though she will fuck up
your life

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.120
# You want her just the same

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.480
# Ask me, I know

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:23.400
# She's got this built-in ability

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.440
# To touch everything she sees

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.560
# And now it seems

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.880
# I've fallen, fallen for her

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.440
# She seems to have
an invisible touch, yeah... #

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.200
I think all the other albums
at that time were,

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.040
to a certain extent, treading water.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.840
The big one was Invisible Touch,

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:45.640
that was the one that moved them
to the level where

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:50.600
they could create an album
that 14.5 million people would buy.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.640
And they never really
topped that moment.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:58.760
# I'm so lonely

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.800
# I feel so boxed in

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.160
# I've lost my wife... #

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.520
I'd become one of the people
of the '80s -

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.920
that was one of the reasons
why people didn't like it.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:14.800
Just do that small lean forward,
please.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.280
I used to travel to England a lot
and do videos for Genesis

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.920
and Phil and other bands there, and
I always watched Spitting Image

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:24.960
on television, because it was
a great show.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.760
And one time they had a video
of Phil,

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:32.040
and he was like crying, and it was
about his wife leaving him.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.120
# As you packed
your toothbrush in your bag

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:39.160
# At once my spine began to tingle

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.160
# As you shoved the door keys
up my nose... #

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.680
I thought to myself, "This is really
cool, they have a Phil puppet."

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.920
And for a long time I was thinking
it would be great to do

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.440
a puppet video with them.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.080
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear,

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.040
that I will faithfully execute

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.280
the office of the President
of the United States.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.920
Mr President, we have an idea...

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:05.560
It wasn't a fun decade at all.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.320
You had such division
in the country. You had riots

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.440
with the police.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:12.280
Thatcher was such an abrasive
and divisive person.

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.960
Do you have any piranha?

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.720
As indeed was Reagan.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.800
# Did you read the news today?

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:24.040
# They say the danger's gone away

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.640
# But I can see the fire's
still alight... #

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.280
It's a song that is the nearest
I've ever come to actually making

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.560
an out in the open statement.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.520
I normally make little comments
about things in a subtle

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.800
sort of an aside way.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:40.240
It's really about how we live in
a very nice world

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.600
and what a mess we're making of it,

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.200
and how it should all be so easy
and how it's all so difficult.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.000
It's a kind of '80s protest song.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.080
# ..This is the time

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.240
# This is the place

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.720
# So we look for the future... #

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:58.640
The sad thing is, you know,
the puppets are in better shape

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.880
than the people we're caricaturing
these days, you know?

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:04.480
I hope Phil's doing well
compared to his puppet.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.120
# ..This is the world
we live in... #

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.160
Yeah, I bought one of my heads.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.560
Someone in Texas has bought my head.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.440
Slightly worries me actually.
What's he doing with it?

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:24.760
I mean, we're just popular,
and there's nothing wrong with that.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.640
I mean, we just got more popular.

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.600
I won't take the credit and I won't
take the blame, you know?

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.560
With MTV and videos, a hit single
overshadowed the whole album,

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.440
and people started sort of saying,
"Well, you know,

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.160
"you stopped doing long songs."

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.320
We never did, really.

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.800
You know, every album had a sort of
15 minute song on it

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.000
till the very end,
but they're album tracks,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.080
and so they weren't
on the television,

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.120
they weren't on the radio, but live
they're a big part of the set.

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:22.040
I always knew the long songs
would always grab them.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.480
A - they were good songs,

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.680
B - visually they were
very impressive,

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.360
with the varied lights
and the staging.

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.400
# Blood on the windows

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:33.840
# Millions of ordinary
people are there

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:37.040
# They gaze at the scenery... #

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.960
So, in a sense, I think
those who came to see us

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.080
because of the singles and the short
songs and the radio tracks

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.200
went away with a different
impression of us.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:50.080
# ..But there's nothing you can do
when you're next in line

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:55.160
# And you've got to go domino... #

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:58.040
When we played live, the songs
that have really stood out

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.200
are things like Domino
and Home By the Sea,

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.920
which are probably the classic
songs from the later period.

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.320
# Images of sorrow
Pictures of delight

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.200
# Things that go to make up a life

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:12.400
# Endless days of summer
Longer nights of gloom

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.880
# Just waiting for that
morning light... #

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.920
Well, neither of those were singles

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.040
or even any attempt at being
a single,

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.000
and yet they worked so well live.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.400
You really build to a climax with
both those songs.

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.640
# ..Help us, someone

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.680
# Let us out of here

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:32.240
# Living here so long undisturbed

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:35.680
# Dreaming of the time we were free

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.240
# So many years ago

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.440
# Before the time
when we first heard

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.800
# Welcome to the home
by the sea... #

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.880
It was extraordinary really, and you
knew it couldn't last, actually.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.840
It was on a divine
visitation that the Lord told me

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.480
that I was to go on the television.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:12.560
'Ernest Angley,
and he talked like that,

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.680
'and he was very affected'

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.440
and he would,

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:21.920
with his beautiful leisure suit
and a very bad wig,

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.120
and he would...

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.640
"Out of the screen, you devil!"
You know, it was awful stuff.

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:34.520
I mean, it was very, you know,
Bible-belt eccentric.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.320
# Do you see the face
on the TV screen

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.840
# Coming at you every Sunday?

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.840
# See the face on the billboard

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.760
# Well, that man is me

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:47.320
# I'm the colour of a magazine

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.840
# There's no question
why I'm smiling

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.760
# You buy a piece of paradise

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:54.000
# You buy a piece of me... #

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.840
I just had a problem with the whole,
you know, TV evangelists.

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:01.920
I mean, when I was growing there
was Billy Graham, you know,

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.560
and that was it.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.880
# ..Jesus, he knows me

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.640
# And He knows I'm right

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:12.120
# I've been talking to Jesus

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.520
# All my life

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.960
# Ah, yes, he knows me

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:19.960
# And he knows I'm right... #

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:22.440
We were improvising and trying
different things,

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:25.880
and eventually when I was singing.
I'd sing, "Jesus, he knows me."

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:30.560
And I don't know if Tony and Mike
were really kind of hearing it.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.440
I don't think they were too sure
about the lyric

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.840
until I'd, you know, finished it.

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:40.120
Because it was a satire in the end.

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.920
I think they kind of thought that it
was a bit serious.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.560
It was quite fun, I mean, you know?

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.400
We had the girls in the middle,
didn't we? Yeah.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.280
We insisted. We'd made so many
videos and we just wanted

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.480
one time to do a video
like David Lee Roth...

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.760
To be near naked women. Yeah!

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.760
So we had this bit
in the middle of that,

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.480
which was an excuse for it, really.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.440
# ..God will take good care of you

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:06.000
# But just do as I say
don't do as I do... #

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.520
I can't remember quite when
we started writing We Can't Dance,

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.520
but it was done in a pretty...

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:26.680
You know, once we started
we kept going till we'd finished it.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:30.720
It didn't take a ridiculous amount
of time to write We Can't Dance.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.040
# I can't dance

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.960
# I can't sing... #

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:38.760
But I wrote a lot of lyrics
on We Can't Dance,

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:42.280
and I think I was allowed
to do that.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:46.920
You know, I mean I still...

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.600
I still play third in line.

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:54.320
Unless the lyrics are right.
We're in now.

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.760
We'll probably come back to a vocal,
I don't know where.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.720
If you want me to sing,
George, I'll sing.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.960
Want me to sing, I'll sing. If you
don't want me to sing, I won't sing.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.600
I'm still the new boy, even now.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.200
It's kind of amazing, isn't it?

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.440
CHEERING

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.840
When we put out We Can't Dance,

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.880
we were very confident
at that point.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:31.400
The line "something about the way
we walk",

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:35.680
I thought was the sort of funniest
line in it, so the feeling I had

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:38.200
was we should do the choruses
with a silly walk.

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:41.200
Now, the silly walk was his,
you know? He'd have this walk around

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.960
which apparently you used to
do at stage school or something.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.640
Yeah, I was at a drama school...
Drama school.

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:48.680
It wasn't that good.

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.360
You could always tell the people
that really shouldn't

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.960
be doing dancing, you know,

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:55.280
because they'd do the same foot
and the same hand.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.440
And it just always struck me
as funny, that.

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.280
# No, I can't dance

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.720
# I can't talk

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:19.880
# The only thing about me
is the way I walk

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.000
# No, I can't dance

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.440
# I can't sing

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:29.720
# I'm just standing here
selling everything... #

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.560
And obviously that did well,
the album did very well.

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.920
It was sort of towards
the end of that period

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:41.840
when we released our final
single from that album,

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:45.440
a song called Tell Me Why, that
I sort of felt suddenly it was...

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:49.200
Something had changed, and we didn't
get played on radio and stuff.

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:51.880
And really from then on, you know,

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.040
suddenly Genesis was sort of phtt,
like that.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.480
And these things sort of sometimes
suddenly happen

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.160
and you don't quite know why.

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.600
I think the fans thought that they'd
seen the last of Genesis,

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:29.840
so it came as a real joyous surprise
when they announced that they

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:33.360
were getting back together
for a final tour in 2006.

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.520
It certainly was a surprise to me.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.400
I think it is the fact that
regardless of your age, race,

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.840
genre, colour - everybody loves
a little bit of Genesis.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:48.520
Have you been waiting long?

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.760
We've been waiting for you 15 years.

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.280
Darling, darling.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.320
'They're a band that's managed to
straddle so many different phases

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:58.040
'in the history of British
rock music and they're still around.'

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:00.520
They were sensible enough
to realise that

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.920
what they had
was worth more than the parts.

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:06.760
Yeah, there are a couple of old
songs in their entirety.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.920
Well, just try a few
and see what happens.

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:12.080
People will investigate that back
catalogue and really realise

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:14.840
that there really is some
wonderful, artistic, intelligent

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.920
stuff in there, which is exactly
what we're always crying out for.

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:20.920
We're always moaning, "Where is
the art, where is the intelligence,

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:23.840
"where is the ambition in
today's simplistic music?"

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.920
Well, it's there.

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:29.560
# Cry, cry at the top of my voice

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:31.400
# Crying at the... #

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.640
I think the secret to Genesis's
longevity

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:36.480
is that they are the progressive
rock band who progressed.

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.320
And progressive rock bands,
according to their fans,

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:43.400
are supposed to stop about two
albums into progressing

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.840
and progress no more,
and that's why they've survived.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:51.480
They're great musicians, great
writers of music, great lyricists.

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.560
And I love the fact
that they also expand

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.160
and explore with other musicians.

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.440
They have straddled so many periods.

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:05.720
They have been hugely successful
within prog rock in the '70s,

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.640
as a pop and rock band in the '80s.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.320
Gabriel's had a solo career
that's spanned, you know, decades.

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.000
I think they will be remembered

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.080
because they've written great songs
and they are great musicians

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.560
and, at the end of the day,
that's what's important.

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.920
# And need I say I love you?

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:23.640
# Need I say I care?

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:26.960
# Need I say that emotions

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.400
# Are something we don't share... #

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.600
I think it's very flattering,
you know, to be part of something

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.200
that people call the
soundtrack of their lives.

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:41.080
But they say, you know,
like, "I grew up with your music,

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.120
"and so therefore, you know,
you're pretty special to me."

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.560
You know, and that's like, it's...

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.480
I mean, that's fantastic for someone
that writes.

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:54.640
I mean, that kind of almost negates
all the negative stuff.

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:00.360
You can't keep doing exactly
the same thing for ever and ever.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:03.400
I don't think. And I think
the reason we lasted so long

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.320
was those changes, which gave us
the chance to actually

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.480
be a bit different each time.

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:11.520
# Throwing it all away

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.080
# Throwing it all away... #

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.600
We just carried on doing
what we'd always done.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:18.920
We just used to write.

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.080
We probably got better at doing
the shorter stuff,

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.560
there's no doubt about that.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.960
We always liked to throw in a bit
more sort of thinking

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.440
kind of music in there.

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:29.440
Did long songs, and tried to do a
few things that were slightly

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:32.440
more... You know, slightly less
predictable, if you like.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.160
But I mean we just...

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:37.000
It's a very difficult thing to know,
you just do what you want

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
at the time with a particular
combination of people you've got.

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:51.360
# ..We're throwing it all away... #

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.280
Never underestimate what difference
you could make or what you could do.

01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:00.360
I've seen other people, you know,
at every stage with everything

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:03.120
I've done, who are smarter and better
than I am,

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.960
and that hasn't deterred me.

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:08.320
So that's what I say to young people
everywhere, you know,

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:11.680
don't limit yourself
or limit your expectations

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.440
because if you want to make
a difference,

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:17.560
if you want to change the world,
it's all there.

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:18.760
The secret?

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.840
Well, the music.
Are we being serious for a bit?

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:25.080
For a bit. Yeah. For a bit. OK.

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:28.840
# Carpet crawlers

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:34.080
# Heed their callers

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:41.560
# We've got to get in
to get out oh, oh

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:46.600
# We've got to get in
to get out

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:49.080
# Oh, oh

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.880
# We've got to get in

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:55.560
# To get out. #

01:29:56.305 --> 01:30:02.398
