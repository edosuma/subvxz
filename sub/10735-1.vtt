overloads, all of Bellwood ...</i>

<i>everything and everyone in it ...
will be sucked into the null void!</i>

Rook: The prisoners have
sealed off all the maintenance

using the air vents instead.

You will get hurt or captured.

Come on.
- Ben: Yes!

15:52.132 --> 15:56.735
Hmm. This is actually quite
smart ... for a non-Galvan.

15:56.771 --> 15:59.438
Ben: Thanks... I think.

15:59.473 --> 16:02.174
The base is really a space

16:02.243 --> 16:04.444
The power core's on the bottom level.

16:04.512 --> 16:09.449
We'll shut down the core so
the null void gate can't overload.

16:09.484 --> 16:13.018

the bad guys and take them out.

- Psyphon: Very good. Yes.

17:34.903 --> 17:39.973
You see, there's a force field around
this base ... low-level, actually.

17:40.042 --> 17:42.861
You wouldn't even notice it.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.680

Maybe not so smart for a
non-Galvan, after all.
