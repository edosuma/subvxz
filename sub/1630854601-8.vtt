WEBVTT

00:00.087 --> 00:01.958
Previously on "Below Deck..."

00:01.958 --> 00:03.568
Primary Karan Bakshi.

00:03.568 --> 00:06.223
He and his wife never leave
home without their hookah.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.226
This is why I did
not go with them,

00:09.226 --> 00:11.489
because they'’re all
freaking crazy.

00:16.842 --> 00:17.843
Yeah, I did not like it.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.497
I need some hot sauce.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.717
We'’re gonna take a moment and
just take in the sunset.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.762
I'’m falling hard
for this girl right now.

00:23.762 --> 00:24.807
Oh, Ben.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.026
What are you doing?

00:30.813 --> 00:33.076
After going out,
it'’s just like he's sloppy.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.730
I can'’t have him be
acting like that.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.254
And then sleeping with me,
it makes me look like an idiot.

00:37.254 --> 00:40.475
You have this charter
to prove to me

00:40.475 --> 00:41.998
that you'’re in it to win it.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.434
Right.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.306
Because I promise you,
you'’ll be off the boat.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.872
Okay, that'’s fair.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.744
No more pushback.
Thank you.

00:48.744 --> 00:51.529
I have a little welcome back
job for you, darling.

00:51.529 --> 00:53.096
We can talk about
it in a second.

00:53.096 --> 00:54.663
- Yeah.
- It'’s just ironing, babe.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.708
Get the clothes out of the
master cabinet and iron them.

00:56.708 --> 00:59.972
No, just wait a second.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.583
Oh, my God.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.150
If you can'’t understand
what the '’tude's about...

01:03.150 --> 01:04.803
I mean, I guess I could
take it to the captain

01:04.803 --> 01:06.022
and she'’ll understand it.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.632
Yeah, go ahead.
Take it to the captain.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.112
You'’re tarnishing who I am
because you want to believe.

01:09.112 --> 01:11.332
No, you are...

01:12.898 --> 01:14.509
You'’re a----ing bully, Alissa.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.554
No, babe.
You'’re a manipulator.

01:16.554 --> 01:17.512
You'’re a bully.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.514
Camille. Stop.
This is insane.

01:19.514 --> 01:21.559
Two crew members screaming
at the top of their lungs

01:21.559 --> 01:23.126
while a charter'’s on board?

01:23.126 --> 01:24.649
That is not okay.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.086
- This is exciting for you.
- No, bitch.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.826
Stop.
We'’re on charter.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.393
I'’m no going to take
this----ing disrespect.

01:36.487 --> 01:38.098
You'’re the one with
the attitude.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.795
You'’re a----ing bully.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.798
Yes, everybody knows.

01:42.798 --> 01:43.799
Is this exciting for you?

01:43.799 --> 01:44.756
No, bitch.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.151
Sh--.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.283
You'’re a manipulator.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.588
You'’re a bully.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.637
148.24.

01:55.637 --> 01:56.986
Are you keep saying
sorry for the attitude

01:56.986 --> 01:57.987
and then coming
with more attitude?

01:57.987 --> 01:59.510
Sorry for the attitude.

01:59.510 --> 02:00.946
I'’m not going to take
this----ing disrepect.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.339
Stop, stop.
We'’re on charter.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.298
You guys got to
compose yourself.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.691
You'’re a bully.

02:06.691 --> 02:07.910
She threatened me that
she'’d take my attitude

02:07.910 --> 02:09.216
to the captain.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.260
I'’m saying don't
have an attitude,

02:10.260 --> 02:11.870
and I'’m wrong for that.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don'’t discuss this now.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.221
Let'’s get through this charter.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.222
We got one more night.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.919
Can you do that for me?

02:16.919 --> 02:17.963
Of course I can.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.139
It'’s just...

02:20.270 --> 02:22.185
Reset, let'’s get
through the night.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.405
It'’s never acceptable
for crew to fight.

02:24.405 --> 02:27.016
On a scale of one to 10,
how unacceptable is this?

02:27.016 --> 02:28.148
A 10.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.200
Holy cannoli.

02:38.114 --> 02:39.637
Good?

02:40.638 --> 02:42.597
- All right, cheers.
- Cheers.

02:42.597 --> 02:43.859
Cheers.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.208
Camille, Camille, Sandy.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.818
Meet me in the crew mess.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.301
Listen, all that happened is
Camille walked in, right?

02:51.301 --> 02:52.607
I said, do you mind
doing laundry?

02:52.607 --> 02:54.086
Yeah, Camille just
said, oh, hang on.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.436
I wouldn'’t have...
that doesn'’t bother me.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.133
Yeah.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.700
Alissa took my side and went,
don'’t talk to Hayley like that.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.528
Captain Sandy, I'’m so sorry.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.965
That can never happen
on a boat that I'’m running.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.488
Yes, ma'’am.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.403
You both will be fired if
that ever happens again.

03:06.403 --> 03:07.970
She'’s a bully.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.277
- She'’s tarnishing who I am...
- Listen, listen, listen.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.626
I'’m standing up for myself.

03:11.626 --> 03:12.583
I know you are.

03:12.583 --> 03:13.845
And let'’s just leave in there.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.675
Yeah, you can tell me a story.
I want to hear both sides.

03:17.675 --> 03:18.894
So I'’m at the beach
picnic, right?

03:18.894 --> 03:19.895
Mm-hmm.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.375
Loving every minute of it.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.246
Listen, I know it'’s bad,
it needs to be dealt with,

03:23.246 --> 03:24.552
but we don'’t need to
- ing talk about it.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.162
I want to hear the story. Finish.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.642
This isn'’t your call, it's mine.

03:27.642 --> 03:28.860
No, okay.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.906
Everybody has a side
to the story, right?

03:30.906 --> 03:32.690
There'’s three sides
to the story.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.388
There'’s their story,
and there'’s the real story.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.303
So I'’m listening to Camille
without judgment.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.261
I will listen to
Alissa without judgment,

03:38.261 --> 03:39.958
and then I'’ll make a judgment.

03:42.483 --> 03:43.484
I'’m at the beach picnic, right?

03:43.484 --> 03:45.268
- Mm-hmm.
- I come back.

03:45.268 --> 03:48.663
First thing Hayley wants to
tell me is about the ironing.

03:48.663 --> 03:49.968
I said, can you guys
just give me one second

03:49.968 --> 03:51.753
I just got on the boat.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.450
And Alissa'’s like, what's
the '’tude about, she said.

03:53.450 --> 03:55.147
And she was going to
bring my attitude

03:55.147 --> 03:58.281
issue back to you again because
I'’m on my last leg.

03:58.281 --> 04:00.022
And she just goes on and
on about my attitude

04:00.022 --> 04:02.198
and that everybody notices
and that everybody

04:02.198 --> 04:04.156
has a problem with me
on the boat.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.941
But you changed your attitude.
I'’ve noticed.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.508
I have.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.205
I gave you an opportunity
to show me on this charter.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.511
Yes.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.252
As far as I'’m concerned,
you showed me.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.253
You did your job.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.297
Thank you, Captain Sandy.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.298
Okay.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.734
So who started yelling first?

04:16.734 --> 04:19.520
I definitely said
Alissa, your comment,

04:19.520 --> 04:21.609
was extremely childish
about the captain thing.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.175
And then she started saying...

04:23.175 --> 04:25.221
Well, that'’s not okay
to threaten you with that.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.396
- Right.
- Okay.

04:26.396 --> 04:27.745
And then it escalated
from there.

04:27.745 --> 04:28.920
Right.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.226
I can'’t believe
she called me a bully.

04:30.226 --> 04:32.489
But like, are you
- ing serious?

04:32.489 --> 04:34.143
Like, queen of projecting.

04:34.143 --> 04:36.885
She'’s had the biggest attitude
with me from day one.

04:36.885 --> 04:40.497
She'’s been praying on my
downfall since day one.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.978
I give people
three----ing chances.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.327
She used them up.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.503
She hasn'’t given me
a chance, really.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.636
I don'’t deal with
nobody'’s bullsh--. Bye.

04:48.636 --> 04:49.724
And it'’s just bullsh--.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.856
It'’s just all----ing bullsh--.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.381
She has a lack of respect
for me as a human being.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.644
Well, whatever happens
on a personal level,

04:56.644 --> 04:58.733
that'’s...
it'’s not a requirement.

04:58.733 --> 05:02.432
What is a requirement is the
mutual respect as a co-worker.

05:02.432 --> 05:05.740
What I need is not what
happened in the main salon,

05:05.740 --> 05:07.524
because I won'’t tolerate it.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.396
But I won'’t do
that again, I promise.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.311
- No. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'’am.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.315
I don'’t see a price tag.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.317
If it'’s a Gucci,
then a Gucci.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.883
If it'’s a Prada,
it'’s a Prada.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.798
The vegetable samosas
you'’re using, one of these.

05:20.798 --> 05:23.279
I'’m going to need
like four bowls

05:23.279 --> 05:25.412
for the tamarind
coriander mint chutney.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.370
If I'’m walking into Lamborghini,

05:27.370 --> 05:29.981
I'’m walking in to buy it.

05:31.461 --> 05:32.767
Lambo black?

05:32.767 --> 05:35.247
Lambo black with orange,
orange everything.

05:35.247 --> 05:37.206
- Oh!
- The graphite.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.773
Could you step on the bridge?

05:38.773 --> 05:39.861
Yeah, sure.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.210
And it looks great, huh?

05:41.210 --> 05:43.125
Looks good. I'’d sleep
in there tonight, maybe.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.518
I'’m from the school of thought

05:44.518 --> 05:45.954
that there'’s three sides
to a story.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.303
Yeah.

05:47.303 --> 05:49.174
So I want to hear your
side of the story.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.655
Hayley had ironed some stuff
for the guests earlier.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.918
She was just letting Camille
know that it was done,

05:53.918 --> 05:56.617
and I think there was one more
garment left to be steamed.

05:56.617 --> 05:59.359
And Camille was like,
I can'’t stop.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.621
I'’m not going to listen to you.

06:00.621 --> 06:02.623
Not right now,
like walking past.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.668
And then I got into it with her.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.632
And then she'’s like, you're
a bully, like da-da-da-da-da,

06:11.632 --> 06:13.285
just screaming in my face.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.810
And it'’s getting to that
point where I just feel like

06:15.810 --> 06:17.986
I'’m letting her walk
over me at this point.

06:17.986 --> 06:20.554
If someone'’s triggering
you to that point,

06:20.554 --> 06:22.077
you have to walk away,

06:22.077 --> 06:23.426
because we'’re on anchor
in the middle of charter.

06:23.426 --> 06:24.949
You know what I mean?

06:24.949 --> 06:28.300
See, as a captain, I'’m not
thinking about Camille.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.041
I'’m not thinking about Alissa.

06:30.041 --> 06:33.001
Fraser needs to be worried
about Camille and Alissa.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.438
I want my department heads
to sort the problem

06:35.438 --> 06:37.005
before it gets out of control,

06:37.005 --> 06:39.355
because this situation
wasn'’t managed properly,

06:39.355 --> 06:40.704
otherwise this wouldn'’t
have happened.

06:40.704 --> 06:44.360
What I want for you guys
to do is just reset.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.927
Yeah.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.624
Camille'’s doing a great job.
I'’ve watched her.

06:47.624 --> 06:50.540
Yeah, I think she'’s really
picked up the pace,

06:50.540 --> 06:52.977
but I do think that she still

06:52.977 --> 06:55.676
is working not as hard
as everybody else.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.504
My thing is,
is if there'’s an issue,

06:57.504 --> 07:00.724
you guys talk about
it when you'’re out,

07:00.724 --> 07:02.813
because if there'’s screaming
like that again,

07:02.813 --> 07:05.468
you will both be
off this boat so fast,

07:05.468 --> 07:07.427
because that'’s unacceptable.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.558
It won'’t happen again.

07:08.558 --> 07:09.559
All right, awesome.
Thank you.

07:09.559 --> 07:11.692
No problem.

07:11.692 --> 07:12.910
Can I get some snacks, too?

07:12.910 --> 07:14.564
Yeah, I can bring up
some snacks.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.436
Guys, please don'’t eat.
Very little, yeah,

07:16.436 --> 07:18.655
because we have
dinner at nine.

07:18.655 --> 07:23.399
When you'’re a dumbass,
and you----ing know it.

07:23.399 --> 07:24.400
You guys know what to do?

07:24.400 --> 07:25.836
Yes.

07:25.836 --> 07:28.883
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.711
I'’m not doing this.
I'’m not doing that.

07:30.711 --> 07:34.410
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.717
Shall I check on the guests
or are they good for the moment?

07:36.717 --> 07:38.414
They were in a really
deep conversation

07:38.414 --> 07:39.763
last time I checked on them.

07:39.763 --> 07:43.724
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.164
If I want to have a
conversation with someone,

07:49.164 --> 07:51.340
I'’ll do that, okay?

07:51.340 --> 07:53.516
Yeah, okay.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.605
Because what happened
in front of my eyes

07:55.605 --> 07:57.564
can never happen again, understood?

07:57.564 --> 07:58.565
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.175
We got that.
Thank you.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.008
I'’m really just gonna take
a breather myself right now.

08:09.053 --> 08:10.925
Coming up...

08:10.925 --> 08:13.275
You don'’t tell me to shut up.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.059
It'’s your girlfriend
that'’s----ing crazy.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.452
She'’s obsessed
with----ing Camille

08:16.452 --> 08:18.585
and her----ing diseased pussy.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.069
I'’ve not had lunch.

08:25.069 --> 08:27.115
I don'’t mind if you want
to go and run off

08:27.115 --> 08:28.682
and eat something quick.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.379
- Are you ready for the party?
- Yes.

08:30.379 --> 08:33.991
I'’m gonna ask you to just try
and get all this stuff...

08:33.991 --> 08:35.863
- Out of the way?
- I'’ll bring this down to crew.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.304
That is a massive carrot.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.351
That'’s hilarious.

08:46.351 --> 08:47.527
I'’m sorry.

08:53.358 --> 08:54.925
Put that there.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.579
No, no, that doesn'’t go there.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.102
Switch it up,
switch it up.

08:58.102 --> 09:00.931
<i>Fraser, Fraser, Sandy,
meet me on the bridge.</i>

09:00.931 --> 09:03.455
Copy that.

09:03.455 --> 09:04.848
Technically, what happened was

09:04.848 --> 09:07.938
I gave attitude,
too much attitude to Alissa

09:07.938 --> 09:09.853
and she threatened to take
it to the captain

09:09.853 --> 09:10.985
because I'’m on my last leg.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.464
It'’s like a threat, you know?

09:12.464 --> 09:13.944
It'’s like, I'm gonna
threaten your job.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.164
Like as if she has
the power to do so.

09:16.164 --> 09:20.690
She was like talking
about everyone

09:20.690 --> 09:22.823
and that everyone has
a problem with me.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.565
For her to come to me
as a bit of a safe place

09:25.565 --> 09:26.696
and a shoulder to lean on.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.916
Like, [bleep] it'’s what I want.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.225
Yachting has always
been a lonely place

09:34.225 --> 09:37.054
and if you'’re on
the receiving end

09:37.054 --> 09:38.665
of a lot of bullsh-- on a boat,

09:38.665 --> 09:40.144
there'’s not many friends
you have on board.

09:40.144 --> 09:42.494
It'’s gonna go in
the piss soon

09:42.494 --> 09:44.148
like, if she doesn'’t
change what she'’s doing.

09:44.148 --> 09:45.410
All right, thanks
for talking to me.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.411
Yeah, of course. Always.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.631
- Hey, Cap.
- Hey.

09:48.631 --> 09:54.115
I respect you and I respect
what you'’re trying to do.

09:54.115 --> 09:56.073
But I'’m gonna tell you this.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.075
When two people start
screaming on a boat...

09:58.075 --> 10:00.643
- Yeah.
- This is where I fire people.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.079
- That is unacceptable.
- Yeah.

10:02.079 --> 10:05.213
I think a lot of people
in Fraser'’s position

10:05.213 --> 10:08.433
is they want to be friends
and they want to lead.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.913
It'’s impossible.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.436
How many of your friends
do you lead?

10:11.436 --> 10:13.830
It'’s hard, isn't it?
You have to choose one.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.093
You know the personalities,

10:16.093 --> 10:17.747
so I'’m gonna leave it with you,

10:17.747 --> 10:20.794
but they need to know
that I'’m aware

10:20.794 --> 10:22.447
and the seriousness of this.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.928
At one point, you'’ll
figure it out and say,

10:24.928 --> 10:26.669
all right, I'’ve tried
this, this, and this,

10:26.669 --> 10:28.105
and then I'’ll make a decision.

10:28.105 --> 10:30.281
I need Fraser to step it up
and figure it out.

10:30.281 --> 10:32.936
It is serious
and they both will be fired

10:32.936 --> 10:34.634
if he doesn'’t manage this.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.593
If he can'’t manage it,
then maybe

10:37.593 --> 10:39.639
you'’re in a position
you shouldn'’t be in.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.292
All right, I will keep
you in the know.

10:41.292 --> 10:42.424
Thank you for your advice.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.778
- Hello, hello.
- Hello, hello.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.737
You all look amazing.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.434
We are starting to fire.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.566
I'’m gonna start plating the pani
pury shots, okay?

10:54.566 --> 10:55.655
<i>Okay, copy that.</i>

10:55.655 --> 10:57.657
Welcome to your Bollywood.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.310
- So pretty.
- Party.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.703
I love the placemats.

11:00.703 --> 11:01.661
Very Indian.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.966
The curry goes in there.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.185
With everything that went on

11:04.185 --> 11:05.795
with last night'’s dinner service...

11:05.795 --> 11:07.623
It'’s cold.
It'’s not warm.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.059
Yeah, I know.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.844
Some things are, like,
amazing and some are not.

11:10.844 --> 11:13.150
I need to smash this the
out of the park.

11:13.150 --> 11:16.893
They'’ve requested Asian cuisine
with Indian canapes.

11:16.893 --> 11:19.069
Those pani puris
are the tits McGee.

11:19.069 --> 11:21.898
- Ooh.
- It'’s like a treat

11:21.898 --> 11:23.944
that might make you
hit the streets

11:23.944 --> 11:25.859
because you gotta take a sh--.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.077
That'’s nice, Rach.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.122
Buena.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.344
Cuddle, that'’s how they call it.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.520
And I was born
yesterday, you know?

11:37.087 --> 11:38.872
Oh!

11:46.531 --> 11:48.620
The golgappa pani puri.

11:48.620 --> 11:52.233
Oh, my God.
It'’s awesome.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.843
Vegetable samosas.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.018
They'’re good.

11:55.018 --> 11:57.194
It is really delicious.

11:58.587 --> 11:59.719
Are those samosas?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.372
- Pretty good.
- Oh, my God.

12:01.372 --> 12:02.722
It'’s really good.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.636
Rache, they said the
shot was perfect.

12:04.636 --> 12:05.725
- Thank you.
- Perfect.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.987
I'’ve got plenty.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.728
I'’m loving every bite of this.

12:08.728 --> 12:12.122
- It has good flavor to it.
- There'’s no fake bollywood.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.776
Wow. What a day.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.038
We'’re ready when you are.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.213
I'’m just waiting on my noodles.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.432
- Okay.
- And I'’ll start plating.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.218
- Cheers.
- Cheers, guys. Cheers, everyone.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.393
Cheers.

12:29.444 --> 12:30.880
Extra.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.882
If you want we can go
ahead and start pouring

12:32.882 --> 12:34.449
all the broth in there?

12:36.451 --> 12:37.887
- Oh, my God.
- Why?

12:37.887 --> 12:39.106
We'’re so beautiful.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.672
I want to take
pictures of everything.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.500
This is a buckwheat soba noodle.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.808
It'’s accompanied by a
miso and ginger garlic.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.767
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.942
It is really nice.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.162
Copy that.

12:52.162 --> 12:54.164
Uh-huh.
I'’m breaking out.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.992
All right, so something more.
We'’re finished.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.602
You'’re finished.
Thank you very much.

12:57.602 --> 12:58.865
Anytime, bro.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.652
Try the broth.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.785
Why? I tried it.
Not my thing.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.438
Word up, word up.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.744
Who'’s your best friend?

13:08.744 --> 13:10.877
Excuse me.
I have a question.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.095
He does not enjoy seafood.

13:12.095 --> 13:14.228
I love seafood,
but if it stinks...

13:14.228 --> 13:17.187
If it smells,
it'’s over.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.362
Oh, so good.

13:19.842 --> 13:23.280
I'’m going.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.282
These five-hour course
needs to hurry the [bleep] up.

13:25.282 --> 13:26.936
No, they just need
to hurry the [bleep] up.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.678
We need food.
We need food.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.593
They'’re talking about
how long it'’s taking.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.334
They'’re ready for you.

13:33.334 --> 13:34.639
All right, cool.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.685
I'’m feeling some bad energy.

13:36.685 --> 13:39.949
This charter got
everybody moody, man.

13:41.646 --> 13:44.475
To plate it perfectly and
to add all the ingredients

13:44.475 --> 13:46.782
that need to be on
that plate takes time.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.001
It'’s not McDonald's.

13:48.001 --> 13:49.306
The fish is going right now.

13:49.306 --> 13:51.221
I'’ll bring the other
two fish up.

13:53.615 --> 13:54.572
Thank you.

13:54.572 --> 13:55.617
Very pretty.

13:58.402 --> 13:59.882
They'’re making it
special for us.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.405
Let'’s eat.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.322
The cod is really good.

14:05.322 --> 14:06.584
So good.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.325
They'’re eating that
like----ing wolves.

14:08.325 --> 14:09.413
I'’m plating now.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.200
- Dessert is here.
- What is it?

14:13.200 --> 14:14.592
I'’m so curious though.

14:14.592 --> 14:15.855
This is the vanilla panna cotta.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.726
- It'’s so good.
- Perfect.

14:17.726 --> 14:20.990
You get the dessert and you
don'’t add too many calories.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.600
And then we'’re finished.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.906
I'’ll put it back away.
Yeah, we'’re done already.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.168
I'’ll draw it.

14:28.911 --> 14:29.999
I'’m going down.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.218
We'’ve got this.

14:33.698 --> 14:36.092
I will be.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.180
Dinner was horrible.

14:37.180 --> 14:39.052
It wasn'’t seven star service.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.228
Look what I have.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.842
So I need to entertain
them with alcohol.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.322
Can I get you guys some drinks?

14:48.322 --> 14:49.932
- Vodka soda lime, please.
- I'’ll be back.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.412
Sure.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.022
- I might bounce.
- You'’re out, mate.

14:53.022 --> 14:54.197
All right, darling.
I'’ll see you in a bit.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.112
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.027
It'’s time to dance.

15:10.126 --> 15:12.389
- Can I get a drink, please?
- Anybody else?

15:12.389 --> 15:14.391
- I'’ll take a modelo.
- And a modelo?

15:14.391 --> 15:15.436
Yes, please.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.611
Oh, what happened?

15:16.611 --> 15:17.742
- Pour some water here.
- That'’s okay.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.048
Can I get a lighter?

15:19.048 --> 15:20.745
Yeah, I'’m going to come
with a lighter

15:20.745 --> 15:22.138
and something to clean that up.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.226
Can I get a drink, please?

15:23.226 --> 15:26.186
What can I get you?

15:26.186 --> 15:27.491
I didn'’t do that.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.406
Just watch your feet
down there, guys.

15:29.406 --> 15:30.799
Those seven.

15:30.799 --> 15:31.800
Can I get a lighter?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.062
Do you know how to use it?

15:33.062 --> 15:34.716
I'’m gonna grab
a vacuum right now.

15:34.716 --> 15:35.935
- Can I get some Pepsi, please?
- No, no, not by the sheet.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.066
Not by the sheet.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.201
- Grilled cheese, grilled cheese.
- Okay, I'’ll be right back.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.767
- Grilled cheese.
- Are you doing this?

15:42.767 --> 15:44.247
Then I'’ll do that, too.
I'’ll also do that.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.251
Coming up...

15:48.251 --> 15:49.992
I can'’t even remember what
I'’m being forgiven for.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.646
I think I need an apology.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.082
You start the attitude and
then you'’re upset when people

15:53.082 --> 15:55.389
come back with you
with attitude.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.043
- What are you doing?
- Drinking.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.740
- No.
- A glass of wine.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.481
You don'’t drink on
the job, Camille.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.879
Can we get any munchies?

16:07.879 --> 16:09.359
Grilled cheese, grilled cheese.

16:09.359 --> 16:12.014
- Oh, are you doing that?
- Okay, I'’ll be right back.

16:12.014 --> 16:15.365
Toasty time for
our lovely guests.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.367
I'’m----ing exhausted.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.413
We have some grilled cheese.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.197
Thank you.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.724
Oh, you'’re out of it.

16:26.724 --> 16:29.727
You guys literally did five.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.947
Tony!

16:31.947 --> 16:34.080
Do not let them
see you again, please.

16:36.473 --> 16:39.389
I feel like vomiting and
crying at the same time.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.087
It'’s time to go to sleep.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.220
- Good night.
- Good night, my love.

16:44.220 --> 16:45.569
I'’ll see you tomorrow.

16:45.569 --> 16:46.614
Thanks, Tony.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.226
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.836
Good night.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.186
I hate them.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.459
Oh, my God.

17:07.809 --> 17:08.940
I got to stop yawning.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.073
Good morning.
How are you doing?

17:11.073 --> 17:12.727
She dislocated
my shoulder last night.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.556
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

17:15.556 --> 17:18.733
- You guys had fun.
- We did.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.082
We surely did.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.606
- 5 a.m.?
- 5 a.m.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.434
Yes, Tony.
You'’re my lifesaver.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.784
He was almost going to make me
go down in the dungeon hole.

17:26.784 --> 17:28.090
Katie!

17:28.090 --> 17:29.352
Deck crew, deck crew.

17:29.352 --> 17:30.919
Haul the anchor,
we'’re ready to go.

17:30.919 --> 17:32.616
Coming up.
Ready, Tony?

17:35.967 --> 17:37.447
<i>Anchor at waterline.</i>

17:37.447 --> 17:39.319
<i>We'’re going to make
our way in now.</i>

17:40.146 --> 17:42.104
Nice riding boat.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.627
You can feel the weight.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.977
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.805
Oh, beautiful. Yeah.

17:47.805 --> 17:49.590
So this morning'’s
breakfast special

17:49.590 --> 17:52.636
is going to be the smashed
avocado on sourdough toast.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.290
We can also do eggs
in any style.

17:54.290 --> 17:55.465
Can I get maybe scramble?

17:55.465 --> 17:56.597
Yeah, I can do that.

17:56.597 --> 18:01.254
I feel so----ing tired today.

18:01.254 --> 18:03.691
- Is that a joke?
- No, it'’s not a joke.

18:10.437 --> 18:11.829
I have five specials.

18:11.829 --> 18:12.700
Poached is in.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.005
Omelettes about to come out.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.138
This is the jalapeno one.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.227
Very good.

18:18.227 --> 18:19.315
Brilliant.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.577
All right, Cap, here we go.

18:20.577 --> 18:22.362
- Cheers, everybody.
- Cheers.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.190
For a good, amazing time.

18:27.062 --> 18:29.891
450 feet to the dock in closing.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.284
Anything else, Kamna?

18:32.198 --> 18:33.155
All clear port side.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.156
All right, Katie, you ready?

18:34.156 --> 18:35.679
Yep.

18:35.679 --> 18:36.898
Starboard coming in line
with the end of the tea belt.

18:36.898 --> 18:37.899
There we go.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.205
Hell yeah.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.163
That'’s it, Katie.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.295
Caption bow line ashore.

18:42.295 --> 18:43.339
Pull that for me, please.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.080
Lovely stuff, girl.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.734
Katie'’s doing a phenomenal job.

18:46.734 --> 18:49.302
This particular marina
with the wind direction,

18:49.302 --> 18:51.652
the bow is
the most important part.

18:51.652 --> 18:52.566
Good girl.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.785
I have a strong exterior team,

18:54.785 --> 18:57.614
but I think interior
needs some work.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.665
For sure.

19:04.665 --> 19:05.927
- Great stuff.
- Thanks.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.537
All right, now get it
on the drum.

19:07.537 --> 19:10.192
- Okay.
- That was fun.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.715
Nice work, though.
Thank you.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.500
- I think I got it down, though.
- Good stuff.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.198
Okay, I'’m going to get into
my one...

19:16.198 --> 19:18.287
<i>All crew to the aft deck
for guest departure.</i>

19:18.287 --> 19:20.811
- That was wonderful.
- I know.

19:20.811 --> 19:21.769
That was amazing.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.339
I know you guys are
going to miss us.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.905
Thank you so much
for everything.

19:27.905 --> 19:31.735
I am thrilled beyond belief
that these guests are going.

19:31.735 --> 19:34.825
They'’ve been on board
for far too long.

19:34.825 --> 19:35.826
Oh, yeah.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.480
We had amazing time.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.612
We were happy with everything.

19:38.612 --> 19:39.830
I was not happy with the beach.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.092
Otherwise, it was nice.

19:41.092 --> 19:42.964
That'’s a little something
for your crew.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.400
Thank you.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.923
It was actually the best crew
we could have got.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.882
I know we made some amazing,
wonderful memories.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.231
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.841
All right, you guys
have a good day.

19:50.841 --> 19:51.973
Thank you.

19:51.973 --> 19:55.759
- Namaste.
- Bye you absolute wankers.

19:55.759 --> 19:56.847
For you guys.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.026
Never come back.

20:05.029 --> 20:06.466
All right, everyone.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.119
Out of our whites,
let'’s turn this boat around

20:08.119 --> 20:09.817
- for our next charter.
- Yeah.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.211
We survived.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.255
Get in here, get in here.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.778
Come on.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.563
Everything needs to be done
at a really high standard.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.260
If not, I'’ll keep us
working till five.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.827
Let'’s do this.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.787
This boat'’s getting a makeover.
I'’ll tell you that.

20:23.787 --> 20:24.919
Yeah.

20:24.919 --> 20:26.616
All crew, all crew.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.139
We'’re going to meet in the Sky
Lounge for our tip meeting.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.271
- Copy.
- Let'’s go.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.230
Copy that.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.840
Oh, look at that.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.190
Congratulations on
completing this charter.

20:35.190 --> 20:37.627
It wasn'’t easy.
I know that.

20:37.627 --> 20:40.804
You worked long hours yesterday,
but you never stopped smiling.

20:40.804 --> 20:43.024
And that'’s what it takes.

20:43.024 --> 20:45.722
I saw how hard every
one of you worked.

20:45.722 --> 20:50.205
Also, if the client ever
complains and I don'’t complain,

20:50.205 --> 20:52.816
that'’s all you have to worry
about is if I complain.

20:52.816 --> 20:55.645
Because you will have people
you can'’t please all the time.

20:55.645 --> 20:58.605
This is not a
reflection of your work.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.172
Oh.

21:01.172 --> 21:05.089
$20,000.
$1530 per person.

21:05.089 --> 21:07.527
Oh.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.268
Hearing that amount is
just not acceptable.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.053
I think we should have kept a
- ing security deposit

21:12.053 --> 21:13.707
for these----ers.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.883
They'’re burning sh--.

21:15.883 --> 21:16.884
Oh, what happened?

21:16.884 --> 21:19.321
Wow. Not okay.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.018
They'’re breaking sh--.

21:21.018 --> 21:23.020
Yes.

21:23.020 --> 21:26.197
If you can'’t----ing tip the
crew, go on a cruise, bitch.

21:26.197 --> 21:27.416
Don'’t rent a yacht.

21:27.416 --> 21:28.417
That'’s all.
Thank you.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.201
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

21:30.201 --> 21:32.203
We'’ve actually managed to do
everything that we need to do.

21:32.203 --> 21:33.161
Interior, how close are we?

21:33.161 --> 21:34.554
Finished my jobs.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.338
Laundry'’s just, like,
turning situation.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.775
I think we can save that.

21:38.775 --> 21:39.689
Yay!

21:39.689 --> 21:42.083
Cheers to the freaking weekend.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.780
Yeah!

21:43.780 --> 21:45.391
I'’ve got some high ass heels
I'’m going to wear tonight.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.827
Don'’t [bleep] with me.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.700
I have to get drunk before
I do my makeup and my hair

21:50.700 --> 21:52.746
because it just turned out
better like that.

21:54.574 --> 21:57.881
Yeah, girl,
you'’ll never not have abs.

21:57.881 --> 22:00.362
I just need to stay away from
her to be completely honest.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.885
She called me a bully.

22:01.885 --> 22:03.452
And I was like,
you'’re a----ing manipulator.

22:03.452 --> 22:04.888
Oh, yeah, baby.

22:04.888 --> 22:06.760
Can'’t wait to get----ed up.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.631
Like, she'’s the
- ing fire, like,

22:08.631 --> 22:11.373
and she just reminds me
of my dad or something.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.635
Like, it'’s just weird.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.681
Oh, my God, that'’s horrible.

22:14.681 --> 22:18.380
My dad is really controlling,
really toxic,

22:18.380 --> 22:19.990
constantly putting me down.

22:19.990 --> 22:23.167
That upbringing shaped how
I let people treat me now

22:23.167 --> 22:24.865
because I'’ve forgiven her
so many times.

22:24.865 --> 22:26.519
Literally, when
I forgive somebody,

22:26.519 --> 22:28.956
it'’s like taking a piece of
me and giving it to them.

22:28.956 --> 22:31.741
At this point, I'’m not going
to let anybody bully me.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.743
Do I want her gone? Yes.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.005
I really need a sharpener.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.920
I'’m going to ask
one of the girls.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.446
- Hayley?
- Yes, darling?

22:40.446 --> 22:42.404
Do you have a sharpener,
like, for makeup?

22:42.404 --> 22:44.058
- Have a look.
- Hello.

22:44.058 --> 22:45.494
Do you have a sharpener
for, like, eyeliner?

22:45.494 --> 22:46.887
No, no, I don'’t wear eyeliner.

22:46.887 --> 22:47.801
Okay.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.368
No sharpener, that'’s fine.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.587
Wait, where'’s our wean?

22:51.587 --> 22:53.197
You guys had a
bottle right there?

22:57.071 --> 22:59.073
I'’m going to let you know now.
I could have walked away.

22:59.073 --> 23:00.553
You triggered me.

23:00.553 --> 23:02.293
Like, you come at
me with an attitude

23:02.293 --> 23:04.165
I want to give you an attitude
two times harder back.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.514
Right, right, right.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.560
To be honest, I cannot
forgive you in full

23:07.560 --> 23:09.257
just because I have
to protect myself.

23:09.257 --> 23:11.128
I can'’t even remember
what I'’m being forgiven for.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.347
Just the attitudes.

23:12.347 --> 23:15.524
I can take responsibility
for my attitude.

23:15.524 --> 23:16.873
But I think you
fail to understand

23:16.873 --> 23:18.135
the way you'’ve been
with me as well.

23:18.135 --> 23:20.224
I do, because, like,
I feel like

23:20.224 --> 23:22.226
I'’m understanding
and forgiving with you.

23:22.226 --> 23:24.533
I think that I don'’t need
all the forgiveness.

23:24.533 --> 23:25.969
I think I need an apology.

23:25.969 --> 23:27.449
That'’s where we don't get on.

23:27.449 --> 23:30.104
These two stews are at
each other'’s throats,

23:30.104 --> 23:32.149
and guess who'’s in
the middle again?

23:32.149 --> 23:34.456
I'’ve got a mom,
and you'’re not my mom.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.632
What you can do is
kind of stand and watch

23:36.632 --> 23:39.026
and hope that it
sorts itself out,

23:39.026 --> 23:42.333
which it clearly isn'’t
going to at this rate.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.553
Someone'’s going to get murdered.

23:45.989 --> 23:47.556
No.

23:47.556 --> 23:48.992
Which is fine, but it'’s just
not fine for this industry.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.603
These chicks next door arguing.

23:50.603 --> 23:53.823
You don'’t find that in a
situation that'’s heated, saying,

23:53.823 --> 23:55.956
I'’ll just run it back
to Captain is offensive.

23:55.956 --> 23:57.392
We'’re supposed to be a team.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.176
You start the attitude,
and then you'’re upset

23:59.176 --> 24:00.917
when people come back
at you with attitude.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.484
Guys, just stop. It'’s annoying
everyone in the hallway.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.181
Ben, this has
nothing to do with you.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.185
Oh, my gosh.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.535
I mean, I can'’t
believe that this

24:09.535 --> 24:11.493
is the way this is going now.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.713
If you come and be crazy,
what the [bleep] do you expect?

24:13.713 --> 24:15.628
Extra crazy back.

24:15.628 --> 24:17.194
What happened?

24:17.194 --> 24:20.023
She knows I literally
don'’t----ing [bleep] with her.

24:20.023 --> 24:22.069
I'’m like, all I want to do
is----ing get ready.

24:22.069 --> 24:24.941
Like, get out of my----ing
space, you dumb bitch.

24:31.034 --> 24:33.515
All I want to do is
- ing get ready.

24:33.515 --> 24:36.083
Like, get out of my----ing
space, you dumb bitch.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.824
What'’s the noise going
on in the corridor?

24:37.824 --> 24:39.260
Oh, who do you think it is?

24:42.959 --> 24:45.440
Alissa darling, just get ready
in your own time.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.746
Don'’t be upset, please.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.443
Alissa and I are trying
to figure this sh-- out,

24:48.443 --> 24:52.795
and I'’ve learned now that there
is no figuring it out with her.

24:52.795 --> 24:54.841
Oh, I don'’t want
to deal with this.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.364
Oh, look, there'’s more
champagne, though.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.758
Oh, wait, should we
finish our wine first?

25:03.850 --> 25:04.938
Doesn'’t really?

25:04.938 --> 25:06.287
Unless Ross is in the doghouse.

25:06.287 --> 25:09.203
Well, well, well.
Tits in a wig.

25:09.203 --> 25:10.770
Toots in a woo.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.206
We'’re heading out, y'all.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.819
Oh, my God, this trolley
is going to give way.

25:16.819 --> 25:18.299
Oh, my wig.

25:20.257 --> 25:23.043
Hayley!
Hayley!

25:23.043 --> 25:26.655
Mary Poppins is out,
and she'’s----ing moist.

25:30.616 --> 25:31.965
Instead of "Eat, Pray, Love,"

25:31.965 --> 25:33.923
it'’s called "Eat, Drink,
..."

25:39.363 --> 25:41.104
Yes!

25:41.104 --> 25:43.324
You look quite cute together?

25:48.416 --> 25:50.592
So, everybody, I want to
say thank you so much

25:50.592 --> 25:52.159
for all the way
up to Charter four!

25:52.159 --> 25:54.509
- Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

25:54.509 --> 25:57.077
Oh, yeah.

25:57.077 --> 25:58.339
Wait, wait.

26:04.388 --> 26:08.305
I'’m definitely hoping tonight
that Ross can show me

26:08.305 --> 26:11.482
he'’s changed because
every single night out

26:11.482 --> 26:12.745
it'’s been the same damn way.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.315
Inappropriate.

26:18.315 --> 26:19.403
Ross!

26:19.403 --> 26:22.015
My ex-boyfriend was
very unfaithful,

26:22.015 --> 26:25.671
and a huge trigger for me
is he changed when he drank.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.324
So, I'’m going to sit
back and watch him

26:27.324 --> 26:28.891
and see how he acts.

26:28.891 --> 26:31.372
Words aren'’t sh-- if you
don'’t put action behind it.

26:31.372 --> 26:34.027
Oh, yes!

26:34.027 --> 26:36.377
You made a big mistake
putting that in front of me.

26:36.377 --> 26:37.900
Sorry, people.

26:41.382 --> 26:42.557
Last year.

26:42.557 --> 26:43.776
I just assumed you were
always like that.

26:43.776 --> 26:44.951
No, man.

26:44.951 --> 26:47.040
Blackened shrimp
and Caesar please.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.824
Please, may I have
a fillet mignon?

26:48.824 --> 26:50.086
What is my food?

26:55.744 --> 26:56.963
Do you want one?

26:56.963 --> 26:58.834
No, I'’m not a smoker.

26:58.834 --> 27:02.098
I always have to do it
with somebody, so...

27:02.098 --> 27:03.099
Look.

27:13.762 --> 27:14.763
You guess?

27:14.763 --> 27:15.938
I mean...

27:19.855 --> 27:21.335
Alissa'’s naughty.

27:23.076 --> 27:24.904
I think we'’d be badly behaved.

27:24.904 --> 27:28.168
But I have real
emotion with Katie.

27:28.168 --> 27:30.213
And Alissa and I
are just some fun.

27:30.213 --> 27:32.085
Who knows? Maybe I wouldn'’t have
even been able to handle her

27:32.085 --> 27:33.956
once we got into the bed.

27:33.956 --> 27:35.741
No, I would.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.917
I'’m like a work horse when
I'’m at work and then I'm like...

27:37.917 --> 27:39.222
I'’ve noticed, yeah.

27:39.222 --> 27:42.225
I'’m a play pony
when I'’m at play.

27:42.225 --> 27:45.054
I don'’t know. I can't even
do this conversation.

27:47.927 --> 27:49.189
Thank you.

27:49.189 --> 27:50.451
All right, everyone'’s
got their food.

27:50.451 --> 27:51.626
- Everyone, eat.
- Eating!

27:51.626 --> 27:53.454
- Woo!
- In the morning!

27:53.454 --> 27:55.586
I'’m sorry, I've got like all
the cigarette in your face.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.197
What are you doing to
make these cigarettes?

27:57.197 --> 28:00.853
Being a dirty----ing
marijuana hook tour.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.332
Look, marijuana ain'’t dirty.

28:02.332 --> 28:03.638
Marijuana is clean.

28:03.638 --> 28:04.944
I cannot smoke.

28:07.903 --> 28:09.731
I'’m gonna do a sex on the beach.

28:09.731 --> 28:10.863
Are you?

28:17.130 --> 28:20.002
I know Alissa is trying
to get under my skin

28:20.002 --> 28:21.395
but I have to be fake

28:21.395 --> 28:23.223
and I'’m really
- ing good at it.

28:23.223 --> 28:25.704
I could probably be an
actress in another world.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.531
Aw!

28:29.533 --> 28:30.796
Are you feeling okay?

28:30.796 --> 28:31.797
Actually better than okay.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.450
Really good.

28:33.450 --> 28:36.976
We are mother----ing sitting
here pretty in St. Lucia.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.892
Bit fed up actually.
with this bullsh--.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.502
Wake up.

28:41.502 --> 28:42.764
I'’m fed up.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.331
To be quite honest
with you, Fraser,

28:44.331 --> 28:45.767
I don'’t really know what else
you could do but----ing

28:45.767 --> 28:47.116
get rid of one of them.

28:47.116 --> 28:48.509
- I'’m ready to go.
- Let'’s go dance.

28:48.509 --> 28:51.468
I can'’t lose Alissa
at this stage.

28:51.468 --> 28:53.340
- She'’s an amazing worker.
- She'’s a great worker.

28:53.340 --> 28:54.820
- Camille.
- I will always stand by that.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.430
Camille has been a problem.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.519
Camille is also a
very----ing good worker.

28:58.519 --> 29:01.217
Are y'’all loving me
- ing good working?

29:02.479 --> 29:03.698
I think we'’re gonna
head off soon.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.004
Yeah, we just wanna go.

29:05.004 --> 29:06.832
We can talk about my
good work there, please.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.790
- All right, give us two.
- No disrespect.

29:08.790 --> 29:09.878
I said nice things, darling.

29:09.878 --> 29:11.227
No, no.

29:11.227 --> 29:12.228
I'’m not saying bad
things about you.

29:12.228 --> 29:13.839
Honestly, say what you want.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.536
I got me regardless.

29:15.536 --> 29:16.929
You guys are getting
so worked up over the fact

29:16.929 --> 29:18.408
that it'’s a situation.

29:18.408 --> 29:19.801
You say worked up
but you'’re there screaming

29:19.801 --> 29:21.455
in my cabin earlier.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.718
Because this is falling on me
so I need to be concerned.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.154
I'’m trying to fix this.

29:25.154 --> 29:27.722
Don'’t go at me.
I haven'’t done anything to you.

29:27.722 --> 29:29.855
How many people do you wanna
have an issue with on this boat?

29:29.855 --> 29:32.422
Like, how much
drama do you need?

29:32.422 --> 29:35.425
I'’m not sat here saying,
oh, I don'’t like Camille.

29:35.425 --> 29:36.644
She'’s saying this,
she'’s saying that.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.298
I didn'’t think that.

29:38.298 --> 29:40.996
I'’m saying I hope that they can
find some kind of agreement

29:40.996 --> 29:43.303
where they can just get on.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.916
I'’m leaving.
Too much like drama going on.

29:49.788 --> 29:50.745
Are you upset or something?

29:50.745 --> 29:51.877
Ben, come on.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.443
You don'’t tell me to shut up.

29:54.880 --> 29:55.924
Me?

29:55.924 --> 29:57.056
For what?

29:57.056 --> 29:58.622
Just get in Alissa.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.146
It'’s your girlfriend that's
- ing crazy

30:00.146 --> 30:01.321
and you just wanna live
- ing a false reality.

30:01.321 --> 30:02.844
And you'’re----ing pissed

30:02.844 --> 30:04.715
because your girlfriend'’s
a sloppy ass bitch.

30:08.589 --> 30:09.938
He'’s obsessed with
- ing Camille

30:09.938 --> 30:11.897
and her----ing
diseased pussy, so...

30:11.897 --> 30:13.246
What the [bleep]?

30:13.246 --> 30:14.769
This group is crazy.

30:14.769 --> 30:16.553
I don'’t even know
what'’s just happened.

30:16.553 --> 30:19.556
He literally just told me
to shut up and get in his car.

30:19.556 --> 30:21.210
Everybody'’s like,
you'’re acting paranoid.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.995
No, I did not say that.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.736
You literally told me
he was like--

30:25.736 --> 30:27.608
I----ing told you
she was talking sh--

30:27.608 --> 30:28.827
about me to other people.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.655
I----ing told you
she was doing that sh--.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.441
And you were like, don'’t.
She'’s not.

30:39.402 --> 30:40.969
Open the door!

30:40.969 --> 30:42.710
Ben, let'’s go.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.106
He'’s so mine.

31:04.340 --> 31:05.907
This is just you and me.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.604
No one is gonna piss us off.

31:13.784 --> 31:14.829
I'’m good.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.432
The captain has told me
quite specifically

31:52.432 --> 31:53.955
that I need to shut down

31:53.955 --> 31:56.262
what'’s going on between
Camille and Alissa.

31:56.262 --> 31:58.438
And as chief stew,
I need to fix that.

31:58.438 --> 31:59.787
That'’s my job.

31:59.787 --> 32:01.963
But I have to make
the right decision.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.922
It kills me.
I hate it.

32:08.100 --> 32:09.579
Yeah!

32:11.016 --> 32:12.408
Ew!

32:12.408 --> 32:15.281
My romper has been romped out.

32:15.281 --> 32:16.717
Is that Hayley out the window?

32:16.717 --> 32:18.066
Help me!

32:18.066 --> 32:20.155
I can'’t get my tits out!

32:20.155 --> 32:22.157
Oh no. It'’s Alissa.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.160
Oh!

32:26.074 --> 32:27.467
- Thank you.
- Ohh...

32:27.467 --> 32:30.296
Right, guys.
There'’s a smashed glass here.

32:30.296 --> 32:31.993
- Rachel, go out the other way.
- Okay.

32:31.993 --> 32:34.169
- I'’m hungry.
- We'’re bloody home.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.475
We'’re bloody home, yeah.

32:35.475 --> 32:37.390
It always gets weird at night.

32:37.390 --> 32:39.000
It gets a little awkward.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.654
Always.

32:40.654 --> 32:43.874
Snatch me up and
give me a spanking.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.617
Bye, darling.
Have a good night.

32:47.617 --> 32:50.533
- Good night everybody.
- Good night.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.667
- That'’s a wrap.
- Love you guys.

32:53.667 --> 32:56.191
Good night, darling.
See you tomorrow.

32:57.279 --> 32:59.020
See you in the morning, darling.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.326
Well, you got an early morning.

33:00.326 --> 33:02.545
7:30, I guess.

33:13.730 --> 33:14.731
There we go again.

33:14.731 --> 33:17.560
I'’m trying to not acknowledge.

33:24.437 --> 33:27.222
Oh my God.
What the heck is going on?

33:36.797 --> 33:38.233
Oh, God.

33:50.245 --> 33:51.986
I had the best night'’s sleep.

33:51.986 --> 33:53.422
You know, I woke up at 6.30.

33:53.422 --> 33:56.208
I was like, yes,
it was a quiet boat.

33:56.208 --> 33:58.297
- Fraser.
- I felt awful.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.908
Last night, the response was,

34:00.908 --> 34:03.084
we can do this without
this negativity.

34:03.084 --> 34:06.174
I don'’t know how many
more chances I can give.

34:06.174 --> 34:07.697
Do you want to give one more?

34:07.697 --> 34:10.657
Yes, of course I do,
because I'’ve been there,

34:10.657 --> 34:13.442
and I was fortunately
given the chances

34:13.442 --> 34:15.270
that I needed
to come to my own terms.

34:15.270 --> 34:17.403
Normally I can remember a lot,

34:17.403 --> 34:19.361
but last night
is a little fuzzy for me.

34:19.361 --> 34:21.972
I have hope in people,

34:21.972 --> 34:24.453
and no one believed in me ever,

34:24.453 --> 34:26.107
and I turned things
around for myself.

34:26.107 --> 34:29.284
So I feel like I can see a
little bit of that in everyone,

34:29.284 --> 34:32.418
so I always will give
another chance.

34:32.418 --> 34:35.464
- All right, I love you, Hailey.
- I love you so much.

34:36.596 --> 34:40.295
What'’s your vibe?

34:40.295 --> 34:41.731
We'’re working today?

34:41.731 --> 34:42.776
Do you mind just tightening up?

34:42.776 --> 34:44.386
I'’m going to write a list.

34:44.386 --> 34:45.909
Sorry about Camille coming
in last night, dude.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.563
It'’s got to stop.

34:47.563 --> 34:49.739
We can'’t keep doing that with
you, and it'’s your space.

34:49.739 --> 34:52.742
Man, if you want to [bleep],
let me know.

34:52.742 --> 34:54.570
And then I'’m just going to go.

34:54.570 --> 34:56.181
You'’re just holding
back, holding back,

34:56.181 --> 34:57.443
and it'’s irritating.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.619
You want to go all in,
and you cannot,

34:59.619 --> 35:01.099
because you don'’t
want to wake me up.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.318
Hailey and Camille, I want
you guys to do cabins.

35:03.318 --> 35:05.712
Let'’s go, guys.

35:05.712 --> 35:06.930
Oh, yeah.
How you doing?

35:15.025 --> 35:17.071
Rachel, Ross, and Fraser

35:17.071 --> 35:19.769
meet me in the crew mess
for Preference Sheet meeting.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.468
Coming.

35:22.468 --> 35:23.730
- Hello.
- Hey.

35:23.730 --> 35:26.124
Okay, charter number five.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.560
Primary charter guests.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.562
Alex Sax is a tech and
real estate entrepreneur.

35:29.562 --> 35:32.521
He and his wife, Louisa, are
pregnant with their first child.

35:32.521 --> 35:34.480
Louisa is 27 weeks pregnant,

35:34.480 --> 35:36.134
and will need to eat
every few hours

35:36.134 --> 35:37.483
between regular meal services.

35:37.483 --> 35:39.485
He does not drink,
which is wonderful.

35:39.485 --> 35:41.487
Dinner on night one is requested

35:41.487 --> 35:43.750
as an around the world
multi-course meal.

35:43.750 --> 35:44.968
Yeah.

35:44.968 --> 35:46.927
Guests request time
with the water toys,

35:46.927 --> 35:49.277
including jet skis
and the slides.

35:49.277 --> 35:50.670
Beach picnic.

35:50.670 --> 35:52.237
So it'’s going to be
gazebos, tables, chairs.

35:52.237 --> 35:53.586
Right.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.196
You know, last charter
was a lot of work.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.329
I guarantee you this is
not going to be like that.

35:57.329 --> 35:58.504
It'’s going to be fine.

35:58.504 --> 36:00.897
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:00.897 --> 36:02.421
Fingers crossed.

36:06.903 --> 36:08.905
Tony'’s just doing those
stairs on the port side.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.124
All washed down.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.081
Perfect.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.607
Do you want this one, or
do you want the long one?

36:14.607 --> 36:18.219
I prefer them short and
stubby over long and thin.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.525
Oh, God.

36:19.525 --> 36:20.743
- I'’m joking.
- Do you know my ex?

36:22.354 --> 36:23.659
- Are we finished?
- Yeah.

36:23.659 --> 36:24.747
Perfect.

36:30.927 --> 36:33.974
That'’s three weeks from now.
It makes me so sad.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.759
So hard dating.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.718
Not that we'’re dating,
but it'’s hard, like,

36:38.718 --> 36:41.764
trying to, like, stick
with someone in yachting.

36:41.764 --> 36:43.853
I know.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.987
Um...

36:48.771 --> 36:51.774
Some little things
in life, isn'’t it?

36:52.601 --> 36:53.602
I am done now.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.561
Oh, you want to fight, huh?

36:56.475 --> 36:57.693
Yeah.

37:00.479 --> 37:02.611
Cheers, babe.

37:03.482 --> 37:06.049
Hello.

37:06.049 --> 37:07.225
Interesting.

37:12.012 --> 37:13.405
- So.
- So.

37:13.405 --> 37:14.797
Woo.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.016
What are you guys doing?
You guys done?

37:16.016 --> 37:17.147
You want some champagne?

37:17.147 --> 37:18.714
I'’m drinking a beer.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.325
I'’m thinking about sitting on
the dock, actually.

37:20.325 --> 37:21.717
- What are you doing, Ross?
- Let'’s go sit on the dock.

37:21.717 --> 37:22.892
- All right, let'’s go.
- Hi.

37:22.892 --> 37:24.677
- What are you doing?
- Drinking.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.461
- No.
- A glass of wine.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.376
- I'’m literally done.
- Done what?

37:28.376 --> 37:29.769
All my tasks.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.945
You don'’t drink on
the job, Camille.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.512
Oh, sorry.

37:33.512 --> 37:34.774
Come on, babe.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.297
- The last.
- It'’s not a holiday.

37:36.297 --> 37:37.994
Well, I'’m also just a human.

37:37.994 --> 37:42.347
I'’m sorry.
You can, I'’ll put this away.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.696
I'’m going to go down and grab
the tea towels

37:43.696 --> 37:44.914
that I left on the counter.

37:44.914 --> 37:45.872
All right, then.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.526
I did leave some on the counter.

37:47.526 --> 37:50.790
Seeing Camille come out with a
pint-sized glass of champagne,

37:50.790 --> 37:52.792
it just goes to show that
there truly is no care

37:52.792 --> 37:54.707
or willingness to do the job.

38:00.190 --> 38:01.670
ing hell.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.633
- It'’s a full glass?
- Yeah.

38:07.633 --> 38:10.288
That'’s a very Camille
thing to do.

38:12.420 --> 38:13.682
Always get your sh-- done

38:13.682 --> 38:15.597
if you'’re going to be
- ing cocked.

38:15.597 --> 38:16.903
ing hell.

38:19.079 --> 38:20.167
Yeah, he'’s fine.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.734
I think we came to
an understanding.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.213
I don'’t really care.
to even talk about it.

38:23.213 --> 38:24.780
ing sick.

38:24.780 --> 38:27.392
We had work to do.
Tomorrow, we'’ve got a charter.

38:27.392 --> 38:28.741
This is not a holiday.

38:34.747 --> 38:36.662
- Camille, Camille, Fraser.
- Go ahead.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.359
- Location, please.
- Aft deck.

38:38.359 --> 38:39.795
- Run.
- Yeah, run.

38:39.795 --> 38:42.363
Of course. It'’s not----ing
inside, are you?

38:42.363 --> 38:44.539
That'’s not aft deck, babe.
That'’s outside.

38:44.539 --> 38:46.280
I know.
I'’m coming to aft deck.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.630
I'’ve just gone into the cabins
and they'’re not done.

38:48.630 --> 38:49.936
Just not your vibe.
I did all my jobs

38:49.936 --> 38:51.241
and helped the girls do theirs.

38:51.241 --> 38:53.461
Good thing my boss
has a crush on me.

38:53.461 --> 38:54.941
A bed shouldn'’t look like that.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.421
- That just fell.
- Yeah.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.292
None of the hangers are done.

38:58.292 --> 38:59.946
I just totally forgot
that was a thing.

38:59.946 --> 39:02.035
There'’s no robe in the master.

39:02.035 --> 39:03.776
Oh, sh--.

39:03.776 --> 39:05.386
I feel like Camille'’s
got an excuse

39:05.386 --> 39:06.822
for every single thing that
I'’m pulling her up on,

39:06.822 --> 39:08.346
which she says has been completed.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.087
And I don'’t know if
that'’s a very good sign.

39:11.087 --> 39:12.741
In fact, I know it'’s not.

39:12.741 --> 39:14.264
What booze were you
drinking as well?

39:14.264 --> 39:16.571
We had the Veuve crew.

39:16.571 --> 39:17.790
- You had Veuve.
- Yeah.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.444
That'’s guest champagne.

39:19.444 --> 39:22.142
I just thought that was the one
we'’ve been using to drink.

39:22.142 --> 39:25.624
I like to give people chances.
Seconds and thirds.

39:25.624 --> 39:27.974
They'’re done.
We'’re not.

39:27.974 --> 39:29.410
Those are things I'’d like
you to address immediately.

39:29.410 --> 39:30.759
Understood, understood.

39:30.759 --> 39:32.413
And then we can maybe
have some time off.

39:32.413 --> 39:36.548
If they can'’t play a role in
supporting the bigger picture,

39:36.548 --> 39:39.507
then they have no role on
Motor Yacht St. David.

39:39.507 --> 39:40.682
Funny girl.

39:42.989 --> 39:45.600
- Night, darling.
- Love ya.

39:45.600 --> 39:46.775
Can make the force be with you.

39:46.775 --> 39:47.820
Yeah, thanks.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.038
Should we take a shot?

39:49.038 --> 39:50.605
We really need this.
We deserve this.

39:50.605 --> 39:52.955
All we do is----ing work.

39:52.955 --> 39:55.741
All right. I think I split
my vagina with that one.

39:55.741 --> 39:56.785
I'’m raging tonight.

39:56.785 --> 39:58.352
Excuse me.

40:01.355 --> 40:02.312
Hey.

40:02.312 --> 40:04.924
I'’m----ed up.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.621
No goddamn reason.

40:06.621 --> 40:08.623
Hey.

40:08.623 --> 40:09.798
I'’m gonna drink my drink.

40:16.675 --> 40:19.765
I can'’t get a wink of sleep
because I'’m terrified

40:19.765 --> 40:22.028
I will make the wrong decision.

40:22.028 --> 40:24.987
I love the girl.
I think she'’s fantastic.

40:24.987 --> 40:26.554
We need a little
of this, you know?

40:26.554 --> 40:28.164
But she'’s not doing the job.

40:33.692 --> 40:35.389
Where'’s Ben?

40:36.956 --> 40:38.697
And what do you do with that?

40:52.624 --> 40:54.452
And then we get up again.,

40:57.019 --> 40:58.194
Did we finish all
of this, you know?

40:58.194 --> 40:59.195
I did my jobs.

40:59.195 --> 41:00.327
Okay.

41:00.327 --> 41:01.676
- I'’ll go for a walk around.
- Yeah.

41:01.676 --> 41:03.199
I believe this one goes in here.

41:03.199 --> 41:04.810
Hey, so I never got to that one.

41:04.810 --> 41:06.289
That'’s all right.
Don'’t worry about it.

41:06.289 --> 41:07.508
Let'’s organize some
buckets with vinegar

41:07.508 --> 41:09.205
and start the chamoising.

41:09.205 --> 41:10.903
I'’ve just got Camille doing
crew mess, emptying the bins,

41:10.903 --> 41:12.818
making sure the fridge
is ready to go,

41:12.818 --> 41:14.472
and just this morning I need to
work on...

41:19.128 --> 41:20.695
Captain Sandy,
can I speak to you, please?

41:20.695 --> 41:22.349
Oh, Lord.

41:22.349 --> 41:24.177
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

41:26.571 --> 41:29.530
Captain, the reason why I'’m
having this conversation

41:29.530 --> 41:33.142
is because as much as I adore
Camille as a person,

41:33.142 --> 41:34.404
and I truly do,

41:34.404 --> 41:37.451
last night was just
the final straw for me.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.455
I'’m going to manage without
her, regardless.

41:41.455 --> 41:43.152
To me, I'’m tired of
hearing about Camille.

41:43.152 --> 41:44.545
I'’m tired of dealing with her.

41:44.545 --> 41:45.894
She'’s the common denominator
in all of this.

41:45.894 --> 41:47.548
Great girl, great personality,

41:47.548 --> 41:50.943
but at the same time, we have
to do what'’s best for the boat.

41:50.943 --> 41:52.901
I'’m proud of Fraser,
that he took charge.

41:52.901 --> 41:55.600
He'’s looked at it
from 30,000 feet,

41:55.600 --> 41:56.992
and he'’s making the correction.

41:56.992 --> 42:00.474
This is another growing
experience for him.

42:00.474 --> 42:01.649
It was the right decision.

42:01.649 --> 42:03.477
I'’m here to support you.

42:03.477 --> 42:06.088
I promise you,
it will run beautifully.

42:17.404 --> 42:19.580
<i>Camille, Camille, can you
please come to the bridge?</i>

42:19.580 --> 42:22.365
<i>Camille, to the bridge.</i>

42:22.365 --> 42:23.802
Copy.

42:26.152 --> 42:28.415
- She just been called up?
- Yes.

42:28.415 --> 42:29.503
Is it about to happen.

42:29.503 --> 42:30.591
Yes.

42:30.591 --> 42:32.245
This is awful.

42:34.682 --> 42:37.555
Oh, ai ai ai.

42:39.339 --> 42:40.470
Oh my God.

42:40.470 --> 42:41.602
Is this actually the right food?

42:41.602 --> 42:42.864
My stomach hurts so bad.

42:42.864 --> 42:44.953
- Good morning.
- Hey, have a seat.

42:44.953 --> 42:46.564
- Good morning.
- Thank you.

42:49.654 --> 42:51.090
- Okay.
- All right.

42:51.090 --> 42:53.614
This is not easy for me.

42:53.614 --> 42:54.963
Oh, my God, no.

42:54.963 --> 42:57.313
- Mm-hmm.
- Really?

42:57.313 --> 42:59.446
I'’m letting you go
this morning.
