01:10.026 --> 01:14.204

01:14.335 --> 01:17.468
Five fingers on

01:19.514 --> 01:21.777
Straight shots of the blue dot,shots shots shots shots, baby.

01:21.907 --> 01:22.734
I'ma pick your poison.

01:22.865 --> 01:24.084
Ooh-ee, yeah, yeah.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.741

And sex with me so amazing.

01:36.183 --> 01:39.011
All this hard work, no vacation.

01:39.142 --> 01:42.580
What the fuck is up, Houston?

01:42.711 --> 01:44.974
[cheering]

01:48.717 --> 01:49.935
Thank you so much.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.426
Yes.

02:02.557 --> 02:03.819
Yes.

02:03.949 --> 02:05.125
Yes.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.430
Thank you.
Thank you.

02:06.561 --> 02:07.170
Thank you.

02:07.301 --> 02:09.085
Thank you.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.520
Wow.

02:10.651 --> 02:11.479
[inaudible]

02:11.609 --> 02:12.393
So good to see you.

02:12.523 --> 02:14.743
Thank you so much
for being here.

02:14.873 --> 02:18.616
I believe y'all know me asIlana Wexler from "Broad City."

02:23.752 --> 02:26.276
You love it.

02:26.407 --> 02:27.451
I love "Broad City."

02:27.582 --> 02:30.498
It's my favorite TV show ever.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.935
Duh.

02:33.065 --> 02:35.285
And I love Ilana Wexler.

02:35.416 --> 02:38.723
But I am really excited tointroduce you to Ilana Glazer

02:38.854 --> 02:39.550
the stand up this evening.

02:47.428 --> 02:50.300
Because there are a lot ofdifferences between Ilana

02:50.431 --> 02:52.433
Wexler and Ilana Glazer.

02:52.563 --> 02:55.740
You're going to be shockedas well as impressed.

02:59.091 --> 03:03.574
Like for example, Ilana Wexlerobviously wakes and bakes.

03:03.705 --> 03:04.358
OK.

03:04.488 --> 03:05.315
Hey.

03:05.446 --> 03:06.708
You know, she wakes
up with a bowl

03:06.838 --> 03:10.320
betwixt her breasts
from the night before.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.148
And she gives it
the old one-handed

03:12.279 --> 03:13.976
[breathing] oh, yeah.

03:17.458 --> 03:24.508
Ilana Glazer, on the other hand,wakes up, takes her vitamins,

03:24.639 --> 03:25.596
and then I get high.

03:31.689 --> 03:34.866
So Ilana Wexler wake and
bake, Ilana Glazer wake,

03:34.997 --> 03:36.128
take, and bake.

03:39.219 --> 03:44.354
Ilana Wexler is free to buyher weed wherever the fuck.

03:44.485 --> 03:48.489
In the street, in a
little building nook,

03:48.619 --> 03:50.926
biking over the ManhattanBridge in one swift move.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.449
I'll Venmo you later!

03:55.757 --> 04:02.416
In my real life, though, Ihave my husband buy our weed

04:02.546 --> 04:05.854
from a New York
delivery service,

04:05.984 --> 04:08.596
while I hide in the closetscrolling Instagram.

04:10.946 --> 04:11.816
I know.

04:11.947 --> 04:14.297
It sounds so 1950s.

04:14.428 --> 04:18.475
Like, I have my
husband buy our weed.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.084
While I hide in the closet.

04:23.698 --> 04:26.483
I just don't want people
knowing where I live.

04:26.614 --> 04:31.401
And listen, it's notlike I'm like, so famous.

04:31.532 --> 04:35.318
It's just that New
York weed delivery

04:35.449 --> 04:37.668
people make up 80% of my demo.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.847
And the other 20%
is here tonight.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.110
Thank you so much for coming.

04:45.241 --> 04:49.289
Oh, thank God you're here.

04:49.419 --> 04:51.378
Tejas, I am so
excited to be here.

04:56.252 --> 05:00.082
So the government is on fire.

05:00.212 --> 05:01.039
And so is the planet.

05:01.170 --> 05:05.479
The planet is on fucking fire.

05:05.609 --> 05:10.614
And the mean dinosaurs inoffice just don't seem to mind.

05:10.745 --> 05:13.095
No.

05:13.225 --> 05:17.404
I think they want us to die,because they're about to die.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.409
That is the ultimate FOMO.

05:26.935 --> 05:30.504
One thing that gives me hope isthe gender-nonconforming youth.

05:35.509 --> 05:36.858
I think it is amazing.

05:36.988 --> 05:40.688
I find it just incredible tosee these young people have the

05:40.818 --> 05:44.648
agency to say I am non-binary.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.520
I don't have that
kind of agency.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.260
And I literally have agents.

05:52.874 --> 05:56.660
It makes me so
hopeful that maybe,

05:56.791 --> 06:01.752
just maybe, the end of babyboomer culture is nigh.

06:01.883 --> 06:02.492
Oh.

06:08.411 --> 06:14.591
Because we have been fed thecrappiest, most boring script.

06:14.722 --> 06:19.422
The script that says that wecan only play one of two parts.

06:19.553 --> 06:30.999
And that is either that of amasculine man, I don't know.

06:31.129 --> 06:34.959
Gun show or whatever.

06:35.090 --> 06:42.576
Or we can play, a, oh, yeah,frickin' feminine woman, oh.

06:42.706 --> 06:43.315
Oh.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.930
It hurts.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.933
It really hurts.

06:52.063 --> 06:55.763
Wobbling on these tiny
little Betty Boop feet.

06:58.722 --> 07:01.508
I can barely balance my
big Betty Boop boobs.

07:08.645 --> 07:11.300
Before a tour, I went to
dinner with my friend,

07:11.431 --> 07:12.649
who is a gold star lesbian.

07:16.131 --> 07:19.264
Now, as a Jewish
person, I am not usually

07:19.395 --> 07:20.614
a big fan of gold stars.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.666
But this one I like.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.233
This one I like.

07:31.363 --> 07:35.237
A gold star gay girl is a girlwho likes ladies, has always

07:35.367 --> 07:39.633
known she liked ladies, and hasnot so much as sniffed a dick.

07:42.897 --> 07:43.463
I admire it.

07:47.118 --> 07:51.688
And she and I just
have a similar vibe.

07:51.819 --> 08:01.437
So I asked her, what percentagefemale to male do you feel?

08:01.568 --> 08:03.613
And she thought about
it for a second.

08:03.744 --> 08:09.314
She was like, I guess
I would say, 60% to 70%

08:09.445 --> 08:14.929
female, and 30% to 40% male.

08:15.059 --> 08:20.021
And I was like,
Ro, me too, dude.

08:20.151 --> 08:23.285
You took the answer
right out of my mouth.

08:23.415 --> 08:26.680
That's exactly the ratio
I was just going to say.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.378
Like, I feel like a little girl.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.118
OK?

08:30.248 --> 08:31.336
I feel like a woman.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.381
OK.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.948
I have like, big titties, durr.

08:35.078 --> 08:38.212
But also, I feel like alittle like, frickin' dude.

08:38.342 --> 08:39.039
You know what I mean?

08:39.169 --> 08:39.780
Like a--

08:45.089 --> 08:49.703
I mean, I partiallyidentify with Mr. Peanut.

08:49.833 --> 08:53.968
I'm like, [singing] who wantssome salty-ass nuts, huh?

08:54.098 --> 08:54.795
Whoo.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.710
[singing]

08:56.840 --> 08:58.581
Sweetheart, you'relooking good, sweetheart.

08:58.712 --> 08:59.843
I love that dress on you, honey.

09:02.890 --> 09:08.635
And for my sexuality,
if I were a drink,

09:08.765 --> 09:11.551
I'd be one part gay,
and two parts straight.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.076
Thank you.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.817
You do what you want
with your hands.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.470
You know, no pressure.

09:18.601 --> 09:19.820
It's just whatever you want.

09:19.950 --> 09:20.995
Cool.

09:21.125 --> 09:21.996
No presh.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.345
I'm not waiting.

09:23.475 --> 09:26.391
You know, I'm just notdesperate for your approval.

09:26.522 --> 09:30.308
But one part gay and
two part straight.

09:30.439 --> 09:31.048
OK?

09:31.179 --> 09:32.833
So.

09:32.963 --> 09:36.576
You might call that
drink a ginatondick.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.584
Or like, at a differentbar, with a different vibe,

09:44.714 --> 09:46.934
a both sexes on the beach.

09:53.331 --> 09:53.680
I have one more.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.335
OK.

09:57.466 --> 09:59.424
Instead of a
Martini, a muffpeeny.

09:59.555 --> 10:00.164
Oh.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.692
Extra nerdy, baby.

10:05.822 --> 10:06.431
Yeah.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.089
OK.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.569
So.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.006
As a gold star lesbian,
and as a ginatondick,

10:16.137 --> 10:17.965
we're not supposed
to feel the same.

10:18.095 --> 10:18.748
But we do.

10:18.879 --> 10:22.447
We like feel that same thing.

10:22.578 --> 10:23.623
And I remembered, oh, yeah.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.320
The whole thing's a sham.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.539
It's a total lie.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.890
You know, like, straight guys?

10:30.020 --> 10:33.589
Straight guys are supposedto be whoa, the most

10:33.720 --> 10:36.070
masculine people in the world.

10:40.683 --> 10:43.555
And I'm talking realpussy-loving straight dudes,

10:43.686 --> 10:45.949
OK?

10:46.080 --> 10:50.258
Not guys who like,resentfully fuck their wives

10:50.388 --> 10:52.913
and then run to work and createpolicy against women's bodies.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.622
Those guys are gay?

11:06.753 --> 11:08.842
I have no idea.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.148
I don't know what's
going on there.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.497
What's the diagnosis?

11:12.628 --> 11:16.023
You know, I don't know.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.852
But you know whatstraight guys like to do?

11:18.982 --> 11:23.508
Straight guys love to be
enveloped in the warmth

11:23.639 --> 11:25.249
and wetness of a woman.

11:30.907 --> 11:37.522
Straight guys love to
run home and giggle with

11:37.653 --> 11:39.873
and share secrets with a girl.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.488
It's very gay.

11:51.711 --> 11:58.195
And straight women, or
women who love dick--

11:58.326 --> 12:02.939
so women who love dick, we'renot even supposed to love it.

12:03.070 --> 12:07.814
We are supposed to
merely accept it.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.708
That would suck.

12:32.839 --> 12:38.496
No, I feel really like,dudely when I'm with a dude.

12:38.627 --> 12:43.850
I mean, honestly, when I havea dick anywhere inside of me--

12:52.380 --> 12:55.296
technically, and I want tobe technical about it now--

12:55.426 --> 12:55.775
AUDIENCE: Oh my God.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.521
I have a dick.

13:09.919 --> 13:15.055
I am part penis at that point.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.491
It's crazy.

13:16.621 --> 13:19.842
It feels wild to be a womanattracted to men, you know?

13:19.973 --> 13:24.455
If this superior design,
a little dick and balls,

13:24.586 --> 13:24.934
you know, what?

13:28.155 --> 13:30.461
You know how I feel about balls?

13:30.592 --> 13:32.594
They make me go--

13:32.724 --> 13:33.334
oh.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.082
Little cuties.

13:42.212 --> 13:44.998
Love 'em.

13:45.128 --> 13:48.088
Because dicks don't
gotta say nothing.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.090
But balls have to have
all the personality.

13:59.186 --> 14:03.668
Gay men-- growing up, Iremember gay men are like women.

14:03.799 --> 14:06.846
Hm.

14:06.976 --> 14:09.065
Have you ever watched
two dudes fuck?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.854
It's not so much a female thing.

14:19.162 --> 14:22.818
There's not a titty to
be sucked, you know?

14:22.949 --> 14:26.996
It's not a clit
to be rubbed, OK?

14:27.127 --> 14:29.216
There's two dicks
in that situation,

14:29.346 --> 14:30.913
and presumably, four balls.

14:36.614 --> 14:37.877
And man.

14:38.007 --> 14:41.619
Homophobia is the
lamest, most transparent

14:41.750 --> 14:42.925
form of hate I can think of.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.153
When someone's homophobic,they're just admitting,

14:53.283 --> 14:55.720
they think about gay
shit all the time.

15:01.378 --> 15:04.338
Homophobia is like whensomeone farts and immediately

15:04.468 --> 15:05.817
blames it on someone else.

15:27.970 --> 15:33.106
But we all know
that he who smelt it

15:33.236 --> 15:35.021
is curious about hooking
up with another dude.

15:35.151 --> 15:38.459
And that is fine.

15:38.589 --> 15:39.155
It's healthy.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.337
Oh, yes.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.338
OK.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.905
Y'all know Lil
Wayne's "Lollipop?"

15:52.212 --> 15:53.256
OK.

15:53.387 --> 15:56.781
So like, I don't mean to
disparage my future very

15:56.912 --> 16:00.437
close friend, OK?

16:00.568 --> 16:03.745
I just think he would digme, you know what I mean?

16:03.875 --> 16:06.052
We'd like, see eye to eye.

16:06.182 --> 16:07.357
Because I believe we
are the same height.

16:10.708 --> 16:13.015
Which means we could easilyfuck standing up, just saying,

16:13.146 --> 16:14.712
any way.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.540
Any old way.

16:16.671 --> 16:19.108
I got to tell you,
this is how "Lollipop"

16:19.239 --> 16:20.544
begins on Tha Carter III.

16:24.766 --> 16:27.073
[boop sounds] No homo.

16:31.338 --> 16:31.947
Huh?

16:35.559 --> 16:36.212
Yeah.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.822
No homo?

16:37.953 --> 16:39.999
Uh-- I didn't say homo.

16:43.698 --> 16:47.441
Yeah, no, I didn't bringup the concept of one man

16:47.571 --> 16:49.921
choking on another man's cock.

16:50.052 --> 16:50.661
You did.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.189
And then you wrote
poetry about it.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.501
Gay women, there is no joke.

17:04.632 --> 17:06.547
They won.

17:06.676 --> 17:10.507
They beat the simulation.

17:10.637 --> 17:12.770
It's two out of two,superior, complex partners.

17:12.901 --> 17:13.510
They did it.

17:17.471 --> 17:21.300
Any menial task a lesbianneeds for me, I do.

17:21.431 --> 17:22.693
I'm like, you need me
to move this table?

17:22.824 --> 17:23.433
I got it.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.045
I got it.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.133
I put dicks in my mouth.

17:30.397 --> 17:33.835
We don't-- No.

17:33.965 --> 17:34.575
Stop.

17:34.705 --> 17:35.315
I got it.

17:41.669 --> 17:42.974
I have to admit.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.846
I have a cis male partner.

17:44.976 --> 17:47.066
Ew.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.415
Just kidding.

17:48.545 --> 17:49.285
He's wonderful.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.592
I fucking love him.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.420
Oh, love him.

17:53.550 --> 17:54.377
Love him.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.857
He holds the key to my heart.

17:55.987 --> 17:56.684
I do this on him.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.555
I put my butt up on him.

17:58.686 --> 17:59.295
I'm just like, hey.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.035
I'm like a dog.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.036
Butt up on him.

18:01.167 --> 18:01.732
Love him.

18:01.863 --> 18:04.692
Delish.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.607
But there's something
I can't get used

18:06.737 --> 18:08.087
to about being married
to this person,

18:08.217 --> 18:10.959
and that is the word husband.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.439
I'm like, hey, nice to meet you.

18:12.569 --> 18:13.483
This is my husband.

18:13.614 --> 18:19.924
[laughter]

18:20.055 --> 18:22.536
Maybe husband.

18:22.666 --> 18:23.580
No.

18:23.711 --> 18:24.320
He is my husband.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.670
I just-- no.

18:26.801 --> 18:27.628
Sorry.

18:27.758 --> 18:28.368
Nothing.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.372
And I'm a wife?

18:32.502 --> 18:34.678
What?

18:34.809 --> 18:36.245
I don't think so.

18:36.376 --> 18:37.116
Really?

18:37.246 --> 18:40.075
You sure?

18:40.206 --> 18:42.121
Husband just sounds
like WASP drag

18:42.251 --> 18:44.906
coming out of this Jewy mouth.

18:45.036 --> 18:49.563
I'm like, oh, my husband, mmhm.

18:49.693 --> 18:53.958
Yes, my husband and I, wetook a little ride upstate

18:54.089 --> 18:56.918
to Bedford to review
some property,

18:57.048 --> 18:58.789
but nothing quite suited us.

18:58.920 --> 18:59.529
No.

19:03.881 --> 19:04.926
Oh, don't worry.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.101
We'll find something.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.410
And of course, there's
always the estate.

19:10.540 --> 19:11.150
So.

19:15.719 --> 19:18.592
Husband also sounds like,I really need my husband

19:18.722 --> 19:20.898
to please sign
this paperwork so I

19:21.029 --> 19:22.465
can finally get a credit card.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.256
So I prefer the term partner.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.695
But we are both Jewish.

19:34.825 --> 19:37.176
So people mistake us for
lawyers all the time.

19:43.921 --> 19:47.838
My partner is the firstpussy-loving straight dude

19:47.969 --> 19:51.842
that I ever lived
with, um, after my dad.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.587
Our parents have
sexualities too.

20:01.591 --> 20:02.810
Yeah.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.681
I lived with my best friend,Matt, who's a gay dude,

20:04.812 --> 20:08.119
for like 10 years before Imoved in with my partner.

20:08.250 --> 20:12.602
And obviously, it was perfect.

20:12.733 --> 20:16.867
And then when I moved inwith my husband I was like,

20:16.998 --> 20:19.261
is this even going
to be fun, even?

20:35.843 --> 20:39.847
I felt so claustrophobic.

20:39.977 --> 20:43.677
I was like, and where
am I supposed to cry?

20:47.637 --> 20:49.073
I was hiding in
the bathroom like--

20:49.204 --> 20:52.686
no, no, I'm just--

20:52.816 --> 20:56.951
taking a very long,
very painful dump.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.133
Oh.

21:05.264 --> 21:10.399
And now I'm just, um, cleaningup the disastrous mess.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.457
But then it started.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.676
We found a groove.

21:26.807 --> 21:29.766
Thank God.

21:29.897 --> 21:33.204
Honestly, it took like sixmonths, but something clicked.

21:33.335 --> 21:37.470
And it just became a
sleepover with my best

21:37.600 --> 21:39.907
friend where our parents
were never coming home.

21:46.827 --> 21:51.353
Houston, please do not tellmy feminist friends this, OK?

21:51.484 --> 21:53.137
But I enjoy making
a house a home.

21:56.184 --> 21:59.013
I love it.

21:59.143 --> 22:01.494
I love like, setting avibe, you know what I mean?

22:01.624 --> 22:02.930
I like, light a little candle.

22:03.060 --> 22:03.887
I'm like, whoo.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.194
Yes.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.065
I pick up a dust
bunny, throw it out.

22:08.196 --> 22:09.197
Taking care of business.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.242
Yeah.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.810
Light some incense, I'm like,mm, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe,

22:13.941 --> 22:14.985
vibe.

22:15.116 --> 22:16.683
It's a bit too aromatic.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.554
So I'm just like,
OK, perfect balance.

22:18.685 --> 22:19.381
Yes, yes, yes.

22:19.512 --> 22:20.121
Yes.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.210
Yes.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.168
I'm like, peeling a carrotover the garbage can.

22:24.299 --> 22:24.734
I'm like, I'm a wife.

22:24.865 --> 22:30.000
[laughter]

22:30.131 --> 22:32.133
I peel it into a nub and
have to throw it out.

22:32.263 --> 22:34.178
Oof.

22:34.309 --> 22:34.918
I'm not a chef.

22:42.056 --> 22:49.498
But one of my favorite thingsabout living with this man

22:49.629 --> 22:56.505
is that his razors are in theshower waiting for me to use.

22:56.636 --> 22:57.245
Damn.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.903
Men's razors are superiorto women's razors.

23:06.515 --> 23:11.651
It's almost like it
was designed that way.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.003
No.

23:16.133 --> 23:16.917
They wouldn't do that.

23:25.012 --> 23:26.883
Hm.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.276
Yeah.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.366
Men's razors are just
excellent quality.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.542
The metal is like
military-grade.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.634
Women's razors are so flimsy.

23:38.765 --> 23:41.202
The slightest breeze
sends them flying

23:41.332 --> 23:42.159
off the shelf of the shower.

23:45.859 --> 23:50.429
And someone decided aboutsix, seven years ago,

23:50.559 --> 23:55.651
to line the perimeter of women'srazors with soap and rubber.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.091
Houston, let me
ask you something.

24:01.222 --> 24:02.876
Be real with me.

24:03.006 --> 24:06.445
Do I look too dumb
to lather my own leg?

24:10.840 --> 24:11.537
OK.

24:11.667 --> 24:15.018
Let me ask you another thing.

24:15.149 --> 24:21.460
After one shower, doesn't thesoap become the texture of cum?

24:31.165 --> 24:36.475
I'm getting in the showerto rub cum all over my legs?

24:36.605 --> 24:38.259
Why do you think I got inhere in the first place?

24:45.875 --> 24:51.533
And the rubber on women's razorsprotrudes past the blade, such

24:51.664 --> 24:54.405
that I'm press, press,
pressing down to get

24:54.536 --> 24:55.363
to the base of the follicle.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.368
Like, can I let
you know if I want

25:00.499 --> 25:01.804
to bowl with bumpers today?

25:05.678 --> 25:06.287
Jesus.

25:09.725 --> 25:13.773
And the area that men
are expected to shave.

25:13.903 --> 25:15.078
This.

25:15.209 --> 25:18.560
The, um-- the saddle.

25:32.095 --> 25:35.534
The saddle is like 12
to 15 square inches max.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.017
Compared to all
this surface area?

25:41.148 --> 25:43.063
Come on.

25:43.193 --> 25:47.763
It takes me like 40 minutesto shave my legs proper.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.548
I could have watched twoepisodes of "Broad City."

25:59.340 --> 26:01.516
Oh, man.

26:01.647 --> 26:04.301
I have a disgusting
little fantasy

26:04.432 --> 26:07.304
I'm going to share with you.

26:07.435 --> 26:15.748
The fantasy is that I pay a manto shave my legs for me weekly.

26:22.842 --> 26:25.235
Well, here's how it goes, OK?

26:25.366 --> 26:29.065
So I set a standing
appointment on Fridays.

26:29.196 --> 26:33.722
I do it around 1:30, so I'malways taking a half day.

26:33.853 --> 26:36.986
I'mma let you guys know I havethat personal appointment.

26:37.117 --> 26:37.857
I gotta go.

26:37.987 --> 26:38.945
Yeah.

26:39.075 --> 26:40.250
Email me or text me.

26:40.381 --> 26:44.690
I'll see you on Monday.

26:44.820 --> 26:47.606
And I go right into themost progressive barbershop

26:47.736 --> 26:49.390
in Brooklyn.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.347
I'm like, ding a ling a ling.

26:50.478 --> 26:51.522
Mario, hi.

26:51.653 --> 26:52.262
Mwah.

26:52.393 --> 26:53.742
Mwah.

26:53.873 --> 26:57.224
We have like a cute-ass
rapport by this point.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.226
And I hike up my
little dress and I

26:59.356 --> 27:02.838
sit in his barber chair likeMork from "Mork and Mindy."

27:11.151 --> 27:12.326
OK.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.328
So like, Mario, is
not like, skimping

27:14.458 --> 27:15.590
out on me because I'm a woman.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.374
You know?

27:17.505 --> 27:20.203
He's not like, giving me shittyservice because it's my legs.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.640
He totally cares.

27:21.770 --> 27:24.251
He's an artisan, OK?

27:24.381 --> 27:27.907
He puts hot towels on mylegs, opening up the pores,

27:28.037 --> 27:30.344
steaming beach towels, y'all.

27:34.174 --> 27:40.615
And Mario freehands a straightrazor, ankle to damn pussy,

27:40.746 --> 27:41.355
all right?

27:46.186 --> 27:51.626
He stops right at the crease,because he is a professional.

27:57.893 --> 27:59.112
So women's razors are trash.

27:59.242 --> 28:00.417
We've decided.

28:00.548 --> 28:03.420
It's been decided.

28:03.551 --> 28:07.163
But there are some productsfor women that I appreciate.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.078
One of those products
is a diva cup.

28:17.652 --> 28:23.876
So a diva cup is areusable period receptacle.

28:24.006 --> 28:27.880
It is a little rubber cup.

28:28.010 --> 28:30.796
But it doesn't
have a flat bottom.

28:30.926 --> 28:36.453
The silhouette is that ofa long titty bent over.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.590
It comes to a long, soft point.

28:46.159 --> 28:51.338
And the way you use it
is that you bend the cup

28:51.468 --> 28:55.211
and fold it like a tiny
little piece of pizza.

28:59.128 --> 29:02.044
And you put it at the
base of your vagina.

29:02.175 --> 29:03.263
And you go--

29:03.393 --> 29:10.661
[breathing]

29:10.792 --> 29:15.057
And you wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

29:15.188 --> 29:16.755
You relax and receive.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.020
You do not block, OK?

29:25.676 --> 29:28.114
And once it's up far
enough, it goes--

29:28.244 --> 29:30.290
[pop]

29:30.420 --> 29:33.075
Out to its original shape.

29:33.206 --> 29:34.076
And--

29:34.207 --> 29:34.860
[pop]

29:34.990 --> 29:36.252
Suctions to the cervix.

29:44.347 --> 29:50.745
And bitch, I promise you.

29:50.876 --> 29:55.924
Your uterine lining is slipslide dancing all the way down.

29:58.971 --> 29:59.798
Splashing about.

30:04.063 --> 30:07.196
And the way you use
it throughout the day

30:07.327 --> 30:13.507
is that you find yourself asingle occupancy bathroom.

30:13.637 --> 30:14.725
Can't stress that enough.

30:18.904 --> 30:19.905
Learn from my mistakes, OK?

30:22.777 --> 30:26.302
And you pull your pants down.

30:26.433 --> 30:30.654
And you bear down justenough to give a slow birth

30:30.785 --> 30:32.178
to a little rubber cup.

30:35.572 --> 30:38.488
But not enough to poop.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.669
So you grab it.

30:45.800 --> 30:50.326
And then you go, oh my God.

30:50.457 --> 30:51.066
What?

30:53.808 --> 30:55.157
And you waddle up to the sink.

31:01.642 --> 31:03.426
And you dump it.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.037
And you go--

31:05.167 --> 31:06.299
[shuddering noises]

31:09.084 --> 31:09.693
Whoa.

31:12.696 --> 31:14.307
And you rinse and repeat.

31:14.437 --> 31:15.047
Simple.

31:24.578 --> 31:27.146
I am ashamed to admit this.

31:27.276 --> 31:31.759
But for the first fewmonths of using my diva cup,

31:31.890 --> 31:35.067
I would use it only at home.

31:35.197 --> 31:37.417
And my husband would
put it in for me.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.988
He's that kind of dude.

31:43.118 --> 31:45.773
He's that kind of man.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.906
Loves pussy, I guess, too.

31:48.036 --> 31:50.734
That doesn't hurt.

31:50.865 --> 31:51.953
He was like, baby, chill.

31:52.084 --> 31:53.041
Chill.

31:53.172 --> 31:55.696
Relax and receive,
baby, ow, my shoulder.

31:55.826 --> 31:56.827
I was like, oh, fuck.

31:56.958 --> 31:57.959
I don't know about this, man.

31:58.090 --> 31:58.873
Shit.
Stop.

31:59.004 --> 31:59.874
Stop.
No.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.093
Go.
Just keep going.

32:01.223 --> 32:01.876
Sorry.Oh, where's it going to go?

32:02.007 --> 32:02.616
Oh.

32:06.576 --> 32:10.363
Where did I think
it was going to go?

32:10.493 --> 32:13.714
[wet sounds]

32:13.844 --> 32:14.715
It's gone.

32:17.848 --> 32:21.243
We're not able to relocate the--

32:24.290 --> 32:30.470
we've lost, um-- an hour
later, I'm like, see?

32:30.600 --> 32:31.471
You see?

32:39.218 --> 32:41.742
What a fucking baby I was.

32:41.872 --> 32:45.311
I needed my daddy to put mylittle diva cup in for me.

32:49.010 --> 32:54.494
Even though it's so intense, Iprefer a diva cup to a tampon.

32:54.624 --> 32:56.800
Tampons hurt.

32:56.931 --> 33:00.500
Cotton is so dry.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.241
That's like, its whole thing.

33:09.683 --> 33:14.253
And I'm going to put that inmy delicious, juicy pussy?

33:14.383 --> 33:16.124
Get out of here.

33:16.255 --> 33:17.038
Get out of here.

33:20.824 --> 33:24.176
I've never taken a tamponout without going--

33:24.306 --> 33:24.915
ow.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.843
And the thing we
all know about pads

33:39.974 --> 33:42.150
is that they're very insulting.

33:45.806 --> 33:50.811
Do I look like a baby
in a diapie to you?

33:50.941 --> 33:53.205
Is that what I look like?

33:53.335 --> 33:59.037
A frustrated infant
sitting in my stuff?

33:59.167 --> 34:00.647
It's not like pads work.

34:00.777 --> 34:02.301
You know what I mean?

34:02.431 --> 34:05.304
There's no like, pad technologythat whisks away the--

34:05.434 --> 34:06.653
no.
No.

34:06.783 --> 34:07.436
It just sits there.

34:10.699 --> 34:14.443
Magnetic force pulls the stuff--

34:14.574 --> 34:15.748
nope.

34:15.879 --> 34:16.967
It just sits there.

34:22.277 --> 34:29.719
My last ditch effort with pads,as though I owed them anything,

34:29.850 --> 34:34.246
were to make them
my overnight plan.

34:34.376 --> 34:39.293
So I would find my most
stretched out, faded,

34:39.425 --> 34:48.303
holey, stained pair of
underwear, balled up

34:48.434 --> 34:55.049
in the corner of the
closet from last month,

34:55.179 --> 34:57.094
slap a fattie on that thang.

35:03.013 --> 35:09.150
And just in case, I wouldlay a towel down, like I'm

35:09.281 --> 35:11.109
a dog coming in from the rain.

35:17.027 --> 35:17.941
And I'm like, this is good.

35:18.072 --> 35:19.813
This is going to be good.

35:19.943 --> 35:23.295
All taken care of.

35:23.425 --> 35:25.775
Until a trickle, trickle,trickle is just leaking

35:25.906 --> 35:26.950
out the side, all night.

35:27.081 --> 35:28.517
Leaking out the
side onto my thigh.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.084
All night.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.651
Because remember,
it doesn't work.

35:35.263 --> 35:38.179
Meanwhile, the weight
of my top thigh

35:38.310 --> 35:42.705
is crush, crush,
crushing the pad,

35:42.836 --> 35:45.143
such that the sticky
is sticking to itself.

35:48.015 --> 35:52.759
And it gets stuck righthere, in the barber's crease.

35:58.025 --> 36:03.900
Like, hey, are we testing
these products for you?

36:04.031 --> 36:06.381
Are these to market yet, or?

36:11.081 --> 36:12.474
So.

36:12.605 --> 36:15.956
Suffice it to say, that'swhy I prefer a diva cup.

36:22.005 --> 36:25.531
There's something that doesn'tfeel totally cohesive about it

36:25.661 --> 36:28.534
to me.

36:28.664 --> 36:33.887
And that's that I can't thinkof an action, nor a product,

36:34.017 --> 36:38.196
that is less diva-like.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.937
You know, I can't
picture J-Lo like,

36:41.068 --> 36:43.113
bending and folding
and searching

36:43.244 --> 36:44.898
for a single occupancy bathroom.

36:45.028 --> 36:46.813
Please, it's an emergency.

36:46.943 --> 36:47.553
Please, please.

36:51.992 --> 36:54.255
Mariah Carey is like,
clutching her diva cup,

36:54.386 --> 36:56.344
waddling in stripper
heels to the sink.

36:59.434 --> 37:00.043
No.

37:03.438 --> 37:05.658
Celine Dion's bearing downjust the right amount.

37:05.788 --> 37:06.702
She's like,

37:06.833 --> 37:09.705
[singing impression]

37:09.836 --> 37:10.445
Oh, shit.

37:14.144 --> 37:14.754
It happens.

37:21.674 --> 37:26.156
My mom told me that padsused to have belts on them.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.553
A pad and then a belt?

37:34.817 --> 37:35.688
Yeah.

37:35.818 --> 37:43.391
I am grateful to
be a woman in 2019.

37:43.522 --> 37:48.614
It is the best it's been yet.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.050
Oh.

37:50.180 --> 37:50.790
Bummer.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.534
No, we're really
grateful to be here.

37:55.664 --> 37:57.231
Thank you, [SILLY VOICE]
so much for having us,

37:57.362 --> 37:59.494
I'm so happy to be here!

37:59.625 --> 38:02.236
Thank you, thank you
so much for having us!

38:02.367 --> 38:03.281
Oh, no.

38:03.411 --> 38:04.325
Forget the thing I said before.

38:08.938 --> 38:13.552
It's a good time to be
a Jewish woman in 2019.

38:13.682 --> 38:18.905
Except that the Nazis
are making a comeback.

38:19.035 --> 38:24.258
Nazis are so annoying.

38:24.389 --> 38:25.868
They're so pesky.

38:31.396 --> 38:34.181
But the Nazis in this
country, I don't know,

38:34.312 --> 38:37.140
they're no Hitler's Nazis.

38:40.405 --> 38:41.754
And I know.

38:41.884 --> 38:45.758
I grew up studying theHolocaust in Hebrew school.

38:45.888 --> 38:46.498
Against my will.

38:50.066 --> 38:51.720
They were real intense about it.

38:54.549 --> 38:58.771
They showed us a lot
of stuff real young.

38:58.901 --> 39:01.774
Footage of the
trains, and pictures

39:01.904 --> 39:07.432
of the mountains of glassesand piles of dead people's

39:07.562 --> 39:11.349
shoes and dead bodies.

39:11.479 --> 39:13.438
They were like, never forget.

39:17.137 --> 39:19.618
I was like, I can't.

39:19.748 --> 39:20.532
I'm six.

39:26.233 --> 39:31.020
It was fear mongering
up in my shul.

39:31.151 --> 39:34.763
Dudes, you are not going
to believe this story

39:34.894 --> 39:35.764
I'm about to tell you.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.810
Get ready, dawgs.

39:37.940 --> 39:38.854
Fuck.

39:38.985 --> 39:40.421
OK.

39:40.552 --> 39:45.295
In Hebrew school, we did
a weeks-long simulation

39:45.426 --> 39:52.302
of escaping the Holocaust totry to get to the New World.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.219
Yeah.

39:56.350 --> 39:58.352
As a kid I LARPed the Holocaust.

40:03.444 --> 40:04.967
Swear to God.

40:05.098 --> 40:06.491
Swear to her.

40:06.621 --> 40:09.842
My parents paid good moneyfor me to do Holocaust play.

40:17.023 --> 40:19.373
I guess there wasn't enoughreal, imminent danger for

40:19.504 --> 40:22.942
Jewish children in Long Island.

40:23.072 --> 40:25.858
So we got to create it.

40:25.988 --> 40:27.337
Huh?

40:27.468 --> 40:28.861
Yeah.

40:28.991 --> 40:32.386
The kids who were alreadybar and bat mitzvah'd

40:32.517 --> 40:34.301
got to play the
role of the guards.

40:37.783 --> 40:40.655
And we would trade
pennies and pretzels

40:40.786 --> 40:43.876
to get to the next level.

40:44.006 --> 40:49.403
It was just a series of
dimly lit hallways, OK.

40:49.534 --> 40:52.624
But we end up at a weddingin the Jewish ghetto.

40:57.063 --> 40:59.587
Education.

40:59.718 --> 41:01.546
And we're all like,
[speaking hebrew]..

41:10.206 --> 41:13.427
When suddenly, the lightsstart flashing on and off.

41:13.558 --> 41:15.473
And we hear--
where are the Jews?

41:15.603 --> 41:17.562
And we were like, [screaming].

41:23.393 --> 41:26.135
And I shit you not.

41:26.266 --> 41:31.314
After three minutes of childrenscreaming, the lights turn on,

41:31.445 --> 41:31.967
and my teacher's like--

41:38.496 --> 41:39.148
you thought you'd escape?

41:43.631 --> 41:46.199
Not such luck, my little Jews.

41:49.550 --> 41:51.813
So it's fully psycho.

41:51.944 --> 41:52.901
Yeah, nuts.

41:53.032 --> 41:54.294
What is that?

41:54.424 --> 41:57.863
But also, I'm like, I guessthey kind of had a point?

41:57.993 --> 42:00.213
Because they are
back in a big way.

42:03.956 --> 42:09.614
But the Nazis in our
country are such a mess.

42:09.744 --> 42:12.530
Like, their branding
is very loose.

42:15.837 --> 42:21.408
Like, they don't even havelike, a look, you know?

42:21.539 --> 42:22.627
They have that red hat, but.

42:29.677 --> 42:32.114
They really just
look like a bunch

42:32.245 --> 42:34.552
of golfers who've been sittingin the sun for too long.

42:38.338 --> 42:41.863
And their merch is
from Party City?

42:41.994 --> 42:44.344
I'm like, I could have pickedup a dozen tiki torches.

42:44.474 --> 42:47.826
I'm not impressed by you.

42:47.956 --> 42:54.484
But Hitler's Nazis, if
we're comparing Nazis,

42:54.615 --> 42:55.224
they were on point.

42:59.228 --> 43:02.928
They just had so
much art direction.

43:03.058 --> 43:05.931
Like, brand concept meetingafter brand concept meeting,

43:06.061 --> 43:09.804
after brand concept meeting.

43:09.935 --> 43:13.765
Do you know that theNazi costume was designed

43:13.895 --> 43:16.158
by Hugo Boss of Macy's fame?

43:20.119 --> 43:21.468
Yeah.

43:21.599 --> 43:25.864
And like, I admired Hugo
Boss clothing as a kid?

43:25.994 --> 43:27.605
Like, it was legit.

43:27.735 --> 43:28.997
I'd go to the mall with my mom.

43:29.128 --> 43:30.564
And we would pass the
Hugo Boss display.

43:30.695 --> 43:32.566
And I'd be like,
I don't know, mom.

43:32.697 --> 43:34.873
I feel like a Hugo Bossbutton down would be pretty

43:35.003 --> 43:35.787
cool for the chorus concert.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.010
I just, I mean, they justwere so creative about it.

43:42.141 --> 43:45.492
They were so enthusiastic.

43:45.623 --> 43:52.717
I feel like Hitler's Nazis likedthe production of a Holocaust

43:52.847 --> 43:54.240
more than they even hated Jews.

43:57.243 --> 44:00.594
I think they liked
the buzz, you know?

44:00.725 --> 44:01.987
The meetings.

44:02.117 --> 44:03.815
And they were always
whispering about shit

44:03.945 --> 44:08.297
and creating like a secretcoded language and shit.

44:08.428 --> 44:11.823
And they would write essaysand write whole books and film

44:11.953 --> 44:14.477
and document, and they wouldlike have little clipboards

44:14.608 --> 44:16.523
and run around town like
putting up their flyers.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.351
They're like, yeah,
meeting's tonight.

44:18.481 --> 44:21.484
Be there or be square.

44:21.615 --> 44:22.485
I drew that.
That Jewish rat?

44:22.616 --> 44:23.573
I drew that.
Yeah.

44:23.704 --> 44:24.487
Shading.
Check it out.

44:29.884 --> 44:33.801
Like the Nazis acted
like they hated us.

44:33.932 --> 44:38.850
But I'm like, y'all
were obsessed with us.

44:45.944 --> 44:47.859
The Nazis were totally
gay for the Jews.

44:51.166 --> 44:56.128
Starting off with over theknee patent leather boots.

44:56.258 --> 45:00.088
I'm like, someone's puttingfashion before function, OK?

45:05.137 --> 45:07.443
They're cutting off
their knee mobility

45:07.574 --> 45:10.185
to gestapo around town?

45:10.316 --> 45:13.319
They're like, no,
it's totally worth it.

45:13.449 --> 45:14.059
They look so cool.

45:21.893 --> 45:24.547
I mean, if I were to
gestapo around town,

45:24.678 --> 45:27.072
I'm not cutting off the knee.

45:27.202 --> 45:29.770
I wouldn't even
cut off the ankle.

45:29.901 --> 45:32.991
I would do like
a low rise cleat.

45:33.121 --> 45:35.689
For like gripping
the cobblestones.

45:35.820 --> 45:36.995
And also like, power.

45:37.125 --> 45:37.735
You know?

45:42.217 --> 45:45.394
That walk.

45:45.525 --> 45:50.486
I just, if you were to say tome, Ilana, come at me, bro.

45:50.617 --> 45:54.273
Like a, you fucking hate me.

45:54.403 --> 45:56.710
And b, oh, you're going
to fucking kill me.

46:00.061 --> 46:03.021
I would lead with the
head and shoulders.

46:03.151 --> 46:05.545
I'd give you a fucking
mean fucking look.

46:05.675 --> 46:09.636
I'd be like, I want to
be as ugly as possible.

46:09.767 --> 46:10.506
And, oh shit.

46:10.637 --> 46:11.769
I'm lifting the knees.

46:11.899 --> 46:13.335
Like, I'm coming at you, bitch.

46:13.466 --> 46:13.988
Watch the fuck out.

46:18.645 --> 46:21.213
Not Hitler's Nazis.

46:21.343 --> 46:22.823
No, no.

46:22.954 --> 46:25.913
They preferred a legextension and a leg extension,

46:26.044 --> 46:30.657
and a leg extension,
and a leg extension, oh.

46:30.788 --> 46:33.573
Ice queen all day.

46:33.703 --> 46:35.270
Serving Aryan apathy.

46:35.401 --> 46:36.489
They don't care.

46:36.619 --> 46:38.012
They don't fucking care.

46:44.540 --> 46:48.022
They figured out the gayhaircuts 70 years in advance.

46:48.153 --> 46:50.242
How'd they do that?

46:50.372 --> 46:52.026
Did the Nazis have
a time machine?

46:52.157 --> 46:53.419
Honestly.

46:53.549 --> 46:55.769
They like, time travel to2015 Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

46:55.900 --> 46:58.032
They were like, oh, shit, bitch.

46:58.163 --> 46:59.294
This is it.

46:59.425 --> 47:01.209
Yeah.

47:01.340 --> 47:03.646
Oh.

47:03.777 --> 47:06.171
We're going tight on thesides and long on top, boys.

47:06.301 --> 47:07.955
Let's go.

47:08.086 --> 47:08.695
Oh.

47:12.917 --> 47:15.267
You see how it flows on top andthen stays neat on the sides?

47:15.397 --> 47:16.007
I love that.

47:20.141 --> 47:21.447
You look wunderbar, Rolf.

47:21.577 --> 47:22.187
Oh.

47:29.585 --> 47:33.807
Sometimes I wonder what mighthave happened if there was

47:33.938 --> 47:36.679
some sort of Grindr back then.

47:40.379 --> 47:43.338
Like, maybe we should makesome sort of neo-Nazi Grindr

47:43.469 --> 47:44.078
app tonight.

47:48.039 --> 47:50.215
Although my brother
Elliott tells me

47:50.345 --> 47:53.740
that's kind of what
Grindr is already, so.

47:53.871 --> 47:55.524
Oh.

47:55.655 --> 47:57.178
Yeah.

47:57.309 --> 48:01.443
That hate shows up in themost surprising of spaces.

48:01.574 --> 48:04.316
You know, I grew up thinkingthere were progressive spaces

48:04.446 --> 48:05.752
and then conservative spaces.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.145
But it's all a fucking mess.

48:10.104 --> 48:12.280
Like New York is so liberal.

48:12.411 --> 48:13.847
Mm-mm.

48:13.978 --> 48:15.893
It's fucking racist
and misogynist

48:16.023 --> 48:18.678
and terrifying at times.

48:18.808 --> 48:21.420
Hollywood's so progressive.

48:21.550 --> 48:23.248
OK.

48:23.378 --> 48:26.381
If Hollywood is so progressive,why is Mel Gibson still here?

48:30.864 --> 48:32.953
Get outta here, Mel, come on.

48:33.084 --> 48:36.609
Mel Gibson has said
terrifying things

48:36.739 --> 48:44.399
publicly about black
people, women, Jews.

48:44.530 --> 48:49.535
I'm like, who do you think didyour deal for Daddy's Home 2?

48:49.665 --> 48:52.581
Australians?

48:52.712 --> 48:54.235
Jews, baby.

48:54.366 --> 48:55.802
Jews.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.630
They're up in there,fighting for your back end.

48:57.760 --> 48:58.109
What are you doing?

49:03.070 --> 49:06.508
Mel Gibson was once
recorded calling

49:06.639 --> 49:15.822
his ex-wife a glum cunt for notsucking his dick in a hot tub.

49:19.434 --> 49:22.089
Sweet baby Mel, let
me tell you something.

49:22.220 --> 49:28.530
Melly, Melly G, you can'tsuck a dick underwater.

49:28.661 --> 49:31.751
It doesn't work.

49:31.881 --> 49:33.840
There's no suction.

49:33.971 --> 49:34.972
It's like-- [sounds].

49:38.105 --> 49:39.193
Also, a girl would drown.

49:46.853 --> 49:54.426
Mel Gibson has eight moviesin production this year.

49:57.820 --> 49:59.344
I love that face.

49:59.474 --> 50:01.302
Oh, no.

50:01.433 --> 50:02.129
Yeah.

50:02.260 --> 50:02.912
IMDB.

50:03.043 --> 50:03.652
Shit.

50:06.873 --> 50:09.789
I just won't be seeing
any of them, I guess.

50:09.919 --> 50:12.226
You know, I haven't--

50:12.357 --> 50:13.488
have I ever seen a
Mel Gibson movie?

50:13.619 --> 50:15.969
I hope not.

50:16.100 --> 50:19.625
I haven't seen "Braveheart."

50:19.755 --> 50:20.669
I get it already.

50:20.800 --> 50:23.585
I know what "Braveheart"
is, you know?

50:23.716 --> 50:25.631
Mel Gibson plays like a--

50:25.761 --> 50:27.067
white warrior.

50:32.899 --> 50:33.682
Painted blue.

50:37.512 --> 50:38.122
Wow.

50:42.169 --> 50:43.344
You want to see "Braveheart"?

50:43.475 --> 50:44.519
This is fucking "Braveheart".

50:48.088 --> 50:52.005
[screaming]

50:52.136 --> 50:53.398
You just watched "Braveheart."

50:53.528 --> 50:56.227
That's it.

50:56.357 --> 51:00.535
I just saved you two
hours and 58 minutes.

51:00.666 --> 51:02.711
So humble of them not to
hit the three hour mark.

51:07.847 --> 51:09.588
I just feel like I don'thave to see the classics.

51:09.718 --> 51:11.068
I fucking get it.

51:11.198 --> 51:13.722
They're the patriarchy
reduced to two hours.

51:13.853 --> 51:14.854
I've seen them all.

51:14.984 --> 51:16.247
You know?

51:16.377 --> 51:18.466
I'm like, do I ever have
to see "Casablanca"?

51:18.597 --> 51:20.164
Must I?

51:20.294 --> 51:21.991
I get it already.

51:22.122 --> 51:25.256
"Casablanca" is
like, title card.

51:25.386 --> 51:31.871
And some baseball glove-lookingdude has a much younger,

51:32.001 --> 51:33.960
much hotter girlfriend.

51:34.091 --> 51:36.571
And he's like, here's
looking at you, kid.

51:36.702 --> 51:37.572
Roll credits.

51:37.703 --> 51:38.356
Yikes.

51:38.486 --> 51:39.357
OK, I've seen this one.

51:39.487 --> 51:40.097
I get it.

51:43.274 --> 51:45.232
I've never seen "Star Wars".

51:45.363 --> 51:45.972
Oh.

51:48.757 --> 51:50.063
I get it.

51:50.194 --> 51:53.327
There is a war in the stars.

51:57.984 --> 52:01.944
From my understanding, it isvery soft, very titillating

52:02.075 --> 52:03.511
brother-sister incest porn.

52:09.169 --> 52:11.911
And then they have
the gall to make

52:12.041 --> 52:14.000
the blackest guy in
the galaxy, Darth

52:14.131 --> 52:17.612
Vader, an absentee father.

52:17.743 --> 52:18.396
Yeah.

52:18.526 --> 52:19.179
No thanks.

52:19.310 --> 52:20.006
I've seen this one.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.486
Thanks.

52:21.616 --> 52:22.356
Hard pass.

52:22.487 --> 52:23.531
Yeah.

52:23.662 --> 52:25.272
Maybe we should burn it
down and start fresh.

52:28.710 --> 52:29.407
I'm trying.

52:29.537 --> 52:31.104
You know, I try.

52:31.235 --> 52:33.672
I'm in this industry
of film and TV.

52:33.802 --> 52:37.241
And I have no references beyond"Get Out" and "Hey Arnold."

52:41.723 --> 52:42.333
I'm an idiot.

52:42.463 --> 52:43.203
Really.

52:43.334 --> 52:43.943
I'm a dumb dumb.

52:44.073 --> 52:47.512
I don't know what's up.

52:47.642 --> 52:51.559
So I watched "Rear
Window" recently.

52:51.690 --> 52:52.734
It was fine.

52:52.865 --> 52:56.782
It was interesting.

52:56.912 --> 53:01.482
But there was one thing
I could not get past.

53:01.613 --> 53:06.357
And that was GraceKelly's tiny little voice.

53:09.534 --> 53:10.143
Ooh.

53:13.712 --> 53:14.321
Ah.

53:17.585 --> 53:19.935
Oh.

53:20.066 --> 53:23.635
I was like, what, bitch?

53:23.765 --> 53:25.376
Speak up.

53:25.506 --> 53:27.378
Yeah, I can't hear you, bitch.

53:27.508 --> 53:28.335
Louder.

53:28.466 --> 53:30.598
I want to hear
what you're saying.

53:30.729 --> 53:32.034
No, no.

53:32.165 --> 53:33.558
Mm-mm.

53:33.688 --> 53:36.822
This voice was designed.

53:36.952 --> 53:40.217
This voice is perfectlyreceived by the male eardrum.

53:43.611 --> 53:45.004
Never too high.

53:45.134 --> 53:46.223
She's not a shrill bitch.

53:49.965 --> 53:52.054
And never too low.

53:52.185 --> 53:53.230
You know what that means.

53:53.360 --> 53:55.971
It's not that.

53:56.102 --> 53:56.711
Never that.

54:00.628 --> 54:05.503
You could hear the spittleon her wet baby lips.

54:09.071 --> 54:12.988
She sounded as though
a doe was suddenly

54:13.119 --> 54:14.251
given the ability to speak.

54:19.168 --> 54:22.171
And all the women at thistime sounded this way.

54:22.302 --> 54:24.478
You know, like Audrey Hepburn.

54:24.609 --> 54:27.525
And you know, I like,
love Audrey Hepburn too.

54:27.655 --> 54:28.482
Or whatever.

54:28.613 --> 54:31.311
But they sounded
the same exact way.

54:31.442 --> 54:32.530
You know, like,
I guess they went

54:32.660 --> 54:35.533
to like the same finishingschool to learn how

54:35.663 --> 54:38.884
to walk and talk like a lady.

54:42.888 --> 54:47.414
All the consonants
were stretched out.

54:50.852 --> 54:56.641
And the vowels never
quite found their shape.

55:13.092 --> 55:17.966
They always sounded like,oh, everything's wonderful.

55:21.318 --> 55:24.712
Isn't it wonderful?

55:24.843 --> 55:25.583
Everything?

55:29.761 --> 55:34.200
This world that men
have designed for us.

55:34.331 --> 55:37.377
They're very clever, those men.

55:37.508 --> 55:38.509
You have to give them that.

55:41.512 --> 55:48.475
So I recently found outwhy these classic beauties

55:48.606 --> 55:50.434
sounded like this in
these classic films.

55:53.350 --> 55:58.659
And it's because when theywould come in for an audition,

55:58.790 --> 56:05.187
the old Hollywood director wouldjizz right in their mouths.

56:09.017 --> 56:14.109
And if the young starlet werelucky enough to get the part,

56:14.240 --> 56:17.548
she'd have to keep it in hermouth for the whole shoot.

56:20.464 --> 56:22.857
Oh.

56:22.988 --> 56:24.032
Terrible.

56:24.163 --> 56:25.382
Awful.

56:25.512 --> 56:26.948
Imagine that.

56:27.079 --> 56:32.606
A Dixie cup's worth of jizzbeing stored in your cheeks

56:32.737 --> 56:36.175
like chipmunks for upwardsof 40 business days.

56:36.305 --> 56:36.915
No.

56:40.005 --> 56:44.183
Oh, can you picture havingto spit out a load at night

56:44.313 --> 56:47.447
into a shot glass and putit back in before hair

56:47.578 --> 56:48.709
and makeup in the morning?

56:48.840 --> 56:49.449
No.

56:53.279 --> 56:54.019
Terrible.

56:54.149 --> 56:54.759
Oh.

56:58.502 --> 56:59.764
Now I guess we know
why their mouths

56:59.894 --> 57:01.156
are always in that shape.

57:01.287 --> 57:01.896
Oh.

57:06.901 --> 57:09.251
Ah.

57:09.382 --> 57:09.991
Oh.

57:10.122 --> 57:10.731
Mm-hmm.

57:13.168 --> 57:14.431
Finishing school indeed.

57:18.957 --> 57:19.784
Terrible.

57:19.914 --> 57:20.524
Awful.

57:24.571 --> 57:28.836
I am grateful for my
foremothers who came

57:28.967 --> 57:30.664
before me in this industry.

57:30.795 --> 57:32.884
You know, they made it asafer place for me to work in.

57:37.628 --> 57:38.498
And I'm excited.

57:38.629 --> 57:40.282
I'm fucking jazzed
about the momentum

57:40.413 --> 57:41.588
women are gaining right now.

57:41.719 --> 57:44.069
I think we're close, you know.

57:44.199 --> 57:46.375
Me Too and Time's Up.

57:46.506 --> 57:49.204
Women are taking a
giant step forward

57:49.335 --> 57:50.641
in a cute fucking wedge.

57:55.863 --> 57:56.821
And we're close, y'all.

57:56.951 --> 57:58.649
We are so close.

57:58.779 --> 58:00.738
I think we are so close
to taking it back.

58:00.868 --> 58:05.482
We are like, hand on head aboutto wrap this shit up close.

58:05.612 --> 58:08.963
I just hope we can do it beforethe planet bursts into flames.

58:09.094 --> 58:10.008
Thank you, Houston.

58:10.138 --> 58:10.878
Appreciate you.

58:11.009 --> 58:12.576
Thank you.

58:12.706 --> 58:15.143
Thank you for being
at my first special.

58:15.274 --> 58:16.144
[inaudible] forever.

58:16.275 --> 58:18.277
I love you, [inaudible].

58:18.407 --> 58:20.932
[music playing]
