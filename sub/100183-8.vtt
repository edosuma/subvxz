WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.542
Previously on Black Lightning...

00:01.544 --> 00:04.351
The Markovians are on
the outskirts of Freeland,

00:04.354 --> 00:07.044
and they're marshalling their forces.

00:07.047 --> 00:08.716
_

00:08.719 --> 00:11.131
The Markovians want to capture or kill

00:11.134 --> 00:13.071
as many metas as possible.

00:13.074 --> 00:15.238
Markovians breached the compound.

00:15.241 --> 00:18.128
- Put Freeland on lockdown.
- Copy.

00:18.131 --> 00:20.774
I need to know what happens
when our powers merge, okay?

00:20.777 --> 00:22.238
Now, tell me what you know about Jace.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.271
Just do it one more
time and I'ma tell you.

00:24.273 --> 00:26.111
And I ain't got time
for your games right now.

00:26.114 --> 00:27.075
So here, get out.

00:27.078 --> 00:29.999
Wake up, Freeland. The
insurgents are not your enemy.

00:30.002 --> 00:31.604
They're fighting to protect us

00:31.607 --> 00:35.034
against the tyranny of our
so-called protectors, the ASA.

00:35.037 --> 00:38.824
Khalil. How is that
possible? We buried him.

00:46.018 --> 00:49.131
Look, Lynn. What I see is you
spending more time at the Pit

00:49.134 --> 00:51.381
than with your own family. Why is that?

00:51.384 --> 00:54.293
- Talk to me.
- Why talk, Jeff?

00:54.296 --> 00:57.455
I talk, you don't listen,
history repeats itself.

00:57.458 --> 00:58.624
I'm done.

00:58.627 --> 01:00.061
Come on. Lynn!

01:13.746 --> 01:15.371
Name?

01:15.374 --> 01:16.612
Tobias Whale.

01:17.836 --> 01:19.120
Date of birth?

01:20.924 --> 01:23.449
April 20th, 1946.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.909
Confirmed.

01:24.911 --> 01:26.703
You're doing this with the others.

01:27.371 --> 01:29.172
You are, aren't you?

01:29.174 --> 01:30.682
Have they figured it out yet?

01:31.667 --> 01:33.268
What you're doing to them?

01:33.270 --> 01:34.527
What you're making them?

01:37.607 --> 01:39.849
Truth in silence, my dear.

01:39.851 --> 01:42.539
I know all about your plan for Freeland.

01:42.542 --> 01:43.991
But you aren't going to

01:43.994 --> 01:46.629
turn me into one of Odell's slaves. No.

01:48.285 --> 01:49.757
I'm not a meta.

01:51.141 --> 01:52.478
I'm something different.

01:56.984 --> 01:59.005
I ride the pale horse...

02:00.538 --> 02:03.322
and hell follows with me.

02:17.755 --> 02:19.630
I don't need your
permission to talk to anyone.

02:19.632 --> 02:21.446
No, you don't talk about me.

02:21.449 --> 02:23.008
Why talk, Jeff?

02:23.010 --> 02:25.320
I talk, you don't listen,
history repeats itself.

02:25.322 --> 02:27.429
You think everything about me,
including my powers, is strange.

02:27.431 --> 02:28.731
This is not about Freeland.

02:28.733 --> 02:30.557
It's not about Tavon, it's about you.

02:30.559 --> 02:32.368
It's always about you.

02:32.371 --> 02:34.329
Tell them exactly how my powers work.

02:34.331 --> 02:35.688
I would never give you up.

02:36.955 --> 02:38.833
Hi, you've reached Dr. Lynn Stewart.

02:38.835 --> 02:40.161
I'm unavailable at the moment,

02:40.164 --> 02:42.614
so please leave your name
and phone number, and I'll...

02:53.375 --> 02:55.175
Okay. Now,

02:55.185 --> 02:56.759
take a deep breath in and hold it.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.097
Let me know if you feel
anything other than pressure.

03:02.717 --> 03:04.442
Ready? Anything?

03:15.228 --> 03:17.271
Well, it looks like your
powers are back to normal.

03:17.273 --> 03:18.931
Thank God.

03:18.933 --> 03:21.846
Are you feeling any residual
effects from the poison at all?

03:21.849 --> 03:23.086
No, just this.

03:24.789 --> 03:26.714
Oh, it looks much better.

03:26.716 --> 03:29.241
Just keep using the
antivenom until it clears up.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.719
And in the meantime, you
should continue to rest.

03:31.721 --> 03:34.389
You need to give yourself time to heal.

03:34.391 --> 03:37.008
Please. We both know
that's not gonna happen.

03:37.010 --> 03:39.394
Look, I gotta get back
to work, Uncle Gambi.

03:39.396 --> 03:40.972
Freeland needs me.

03:40.975 --> 03:42.525
I figured you might say that.

03:42.528 --> 03:45.268
Well, in that case, there's
something I want to show you.

03:48.313 --> 03:50.479
I found this when I was
going through the system

03:50.481 --> 03:51.764
that I mirrored in the Pit.

03:51.766 --> 03:54.391
This aired in Jacksonville
a few days ago.

03:54.393 --> 03:57.203
Freeland continues to be on lockdown.

03:57.205 --> 04:00.439
Officials say they're still
no closer to eradicating

04:00.441 --> 04:02.733
the SARS epidemic which
forced the government

04:02.735 --> 04:04.318
to quarantine the city

04:04.320 --> 04:05.953
more than a month ago.

04:05.955 --> 04:07.140
What the hell?

04:08.091 --> 04:09.406
SARS?

04:09.408 --> 04:11.426
What about the metas? Markovia?

04:11.428 --> 04:13.069
No mention of any of that.

04:13.072 --> 04:14.594
Apparently, the ASA doesn't want

04:14.597 --> 04:16.622
the world to know what's
really going on here.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.048
So, that's why no one's come near us,

04:18.051 --> 04:20.249
because they think it's an outbreak?

04:22.439 --> 04:25.089
Uncle Gambi, look. We got
to get the message out there.

04:25.091 --> 04:27.942
We have to tell the people the truth.

04:27.944 --> 04:29.277
I tried uploading the video

04:29.279 --> 04:31.437
of your father getting
beaten by the ASA.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.806
I figured that a community/Olympic hero

04:33.808 --> 04:35.671
being assaulted would
get the world's attention,

04:35.673 --> 04:37.618
but my equipment is too limited.

04:37.620 --> 04:40.270
I can get a signal out, but
only as far as South Freeland.

04:40.272 --> 04:42.365
Okay, so what else can we use?

04:43.460 --> 04:44.825
I'm looking.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.235
But I need more evidence.

04:46.237 --> 04:48.371
Photos, videos,
something that will prove

04:48.373 --> 04:50.101
what happened to your dad wasn't just

04:50.104 --> 04:51.874
another black man getting beaten down.

04:51.876 --> 04:54.624
Something that will show the
world what's really going on here.

04:58.624 --> 05:00.648
I think I know somebody who can help us.

05:08.050 --> 05:09.587
Where did you go, Khalil?

05:14.491 --> 05:15.865
Excuse me, Dr. Stewart.

05:15.867 --> 05:17.733
Patient 49 is here for his blood test.

05:17.735 --> 05:20.477
Thank you, Nurse Allen.
Put him over there.

05:20.479 --> 05:22.252
Okay. Right over here, guys.

05:36.829 --> 05:39.588
Ah, Dr. Stewart.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.599
How is that super family of yours?

05:45.855 --> 05:47.066
I need to test your blood

05:47.069 --> 05:50.764
to see if your antibodies are
regenerating for the stabilization cure.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.586
You know, Dr. Stewart,
I'm jealous of you.

05:55.532 --> 05:59.489
Yes. Jealous because
you're going to be famous.

06:01.779 --> 06:05.206
Come, come now. Don't be modest.

06:05.208 --> 06:08.190
I can see you on the cover
of Ebony and Essence now.

06:09.695 --> 06:11.212
"Dr. Lynn Stewart,

06:11.214 --> 06:14.549
the strong, sexy,
intelligent black woman

06:14.551 --> 06:16.241
who saved Freeland and the world

06:16.243 --> 06:18.085
by enslaving black youth."

06:18.087 --> 06:19.369
Hmm.

06:19.371 --> 06:21.079
What're you rambling about?

06:21.081 --> 06:23.006
Fame, my dear.

06:23.009 --> 06:24.333
Fame for the cure.

06:24.335 --> 06:25.768
I asked you a question.

06:25.771 --> 06:27.220
Don't be naive, Dr. Stewart.

06:27.223 --> 06:29.472
You know exactly what the ASA
is gonna do with those metas

06:29.474 --> 06:30.848
once you stabilize them.

06:30.850 --> 06:33.192
Just look at the roster you gave me.

06:33.194 --> 06:36.479
Super strength, accelerated healing,

06:36.481 --> 06:40.149
and my favorite... camouflage.

06:40.151 --> 06:41.796
Seem like weapons to me.

06:42.912 --> 06:44.412
I've heard it all before.

06:44.414 --> 06:46.357
Oh, really? From who?

06:47.733 --> 06:51.127
Wait. You don't mean Black Lightning?

06:52.589 --> 06:53.946
How interesting.

06:53.948 --> 06:55.998
I guess he's smarter than I thought.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.800
Then again, that suit.

06:57.802 --> 06:59.594
Tell me. I've always been curious.

06:59.596 --> 07:01.504
Is he a big fan of Earth, Wind & Fire?

07:01.506 --> 07:03.097
Or is it Parliament?

07:03.099 --> 07:04.432
Perhaps Bootsy Collins.

07:04.434 --> 07:06.434
I'm not being naive.

07:06.436 --> 07:08.752
I know the ASA wants to
use the metas as weapons

07:08.754 --> 07:09.937
and once they're stabilized,

07:09.939 --> 07:11.330
they might decide they want that too,

07:11.332 --> 07:13.441
but at least this way
I'm giving them a choice.

07:13.443 --> 07:15.801
Hmm, is that what
they're calling slavery

07:15.803 --> 07:18.095
these politically correct days?

07:18.097 --> 07:20.430
I've worked with the ASA for decades,

07:20.432 --> 07:22.933
with you about a month and some change.

07:22.935 --> 07:25.453
Does it look like these
kids have a "choice"

07:25.455 --> 07:26.787
to make of their own?

07:26.789 --> 07:28.313
No, Dr. Stewart,

07:28.315 --> 07:31.125
the choice has already
been made for them.

07:31.127 --> 07:34.074
Those kids will be weapons
whether they like it or not.

07:34.797 --> 07:36.631
And not just them.

07:36.633 --> 07:40.117
But everyone in Freeland
with the meta-gene.

07:40.119 --> 07:42.619
Now that the ASA knows
what Green Light can do,

07:42.621 --> 07:45.548
they'll flood the city until they
get as many metas as they can.

07:45.550 --> 07:47.383
- It's not possible.
- Hmm.

07:47.385 --> 07:49.596
How would they even get
that much Green Light?

07:49.599 --> 07:51.354
I don't know.

07:53.007 --> 07:55.007
But what I do know is,

07:55.009 --> 07:58.069
it'll be all because of you.

07:58.071 --> 08:01.988
The great, smart,
talented, and beautiful

08:01.991 --> 08:04.777
Dr. Lynn Stewart.

08:04.780 --> 08:09.863
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

08:14.852 --> 08:16.003
Okay.

08:19.008 --> 08:20.708
All right, all right. Okay, I'm coming.

08:21.368 --> 08:22.552
Sheesh.

08:27.258 --> 08:28.574
What the hell was that for?

08:28.576 --> 08:30.709
Oh, that was for kicking
me out the last time.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:33.022 --> 08:35.009
Look, I invited you over to apologize.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.923
All right? I was wrong.

08:37.926 --> 08:40.193
You were right. I'm sorry.

08:40.197 --> 08:42.001
You should be.

08:42.005 --> 08:43.539
If you try something like that again,

08:43.542 --> 08:46.557
I'm gonna barbeque your
Pantene-commercial-looking ass.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.165
All right, all right.
It won't happen again.

08:52.376 --> 08:53.634
- I promise.
- Good.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.259
Okay, I'm sorry, too.

08:58.262 --> 09:00.046
I wasn't trying to stress you.

09:00.049 --> 09:03.383
It's just, I really wanna know what's
happening when our powers merge.

09:03.386 --> 09:06.554
Me, I've felt like a
freak for a long time,

09:06.556 --> 09:09.390
but this just takes things to
a whole new level, you know.

09:09.392 --> 09:11.083
Maybe.

09:11.085 --> 09:12.226
Maybe it has something to do

09:12.228 --> 09:13.728
with your powers being electrical

09:13.730 --> 09:15.502
and mine being earth-based.

09:15.505 --> 09:16.897
You lost me.

09:16.899 --> 09:18.432
All right, look, um...

09:18.434 --> 09:20.050
you know when there's
a lightning strike,

09:20.052 --> 09:21.259
the earth grounds the energy?

09:21.261 --> 09:22.586
Yeah. So?

09:22.588 --> 09:25.278
Okay, well, maybe that's
what's happening here.

09:25.281 --> 09:27.241
You know, you being able
to control lightning,

09:27.243 --> 09:28.947
and I can control the earth.

09:29.779 --> 09:32.988
Maybe I, uh, maybe I ground you.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.157
So, if you ground me,
that means I can use

09:35.159 --> 09:37.043
my powers on you and not hurt you?

09:37.045 --> 09:38.285
Like I don't have to hold back?

09:39.756 --> 09:41.279
Ah, well,

09:41.281 --> 09:42.798
theoretically, I mean, yeah.

09:44.450 --> 09:47.093
Whoa! Okay, chill out!
It's just a theory.

09:47.096 --> 09:49.121
It's just a theory.

09:49.123 --> 09:50.983
Damn.

09:55.730 --> 09:57.513
That's the truth, people.

09:57.515 --> 09:58.939
And we won't stop telling it

09:58.941 --> 10:01.133
until Freeland is free.

10:07.985 --> 10:10.109
That was a nice speech.

10:10.112 --> 10:11.786
I wish I had known you were here,

10:11.788 --> 10:13.487
I would have had you say a few words.

10:13.489 --> 10:14.789
Mmm-mmm. Actually,

10:14.791 --> 10:17.866
I came to talk about
a different audience.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.294
Jamillah, what if I told
you I can get a message

10:20.296 --> 10:22.138
outside the perimeter?

10:22.141 --> 10:24.114
Really?

10:24.116 --> 10:27.134
We just figured out how to
broadcast to the rest of Freeland.

10:27.136 --> 10:30.170
Now you're saying that you can
get a transmission out beyond that?

10:30.172 --> 10:32.622
- Mmm-hmm.
- What about the firewall? The media blackout?

10:32.624 --> 10:34.141
Leave that to me.

10:34.143 --> 10:36.810
What we need now is footage.

10:36.813 --> 10:39.221
What tapes do you have on the ASA?

10:39.223 --> 10:42.650
Um, beatings, riots...

10:42.652 --> 10:44.151
- camps.
- Good.

10:44.153 --> 10:46.261
- I've got it all.
- Good, good.

10:46.263 --> 10:48.138
Round up your best material.

10:48.140 --> 10:50.899
I'll notify you when the
plan's in place. Okay?

10:50.902 --> 10:52.225
What should I do in the meantime?

10:52.227 --> 10:54.144
Keep the cameras rolling.

11:08.994 --> 11:10.761
Yeah, yeah.

11:18.187 --> 11:19.520
Okay, what did I do now?

11:19.522 --> 11:21.023
Diffuse another one of your bombs?

11:21.026 --> 11:22.117
Hey, look, Jeff.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.268
I'm sorry for barging in on
you like that the other day.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.863
But you were right. We do
need to get on the same page.

11:28.865 --> 11:31.240
Whoa, whoa, what happened to,

11:31.242 --> 11:34.184
"You handle the ASA your
way, I'll handle 'em my way"?

11:34.186 --> 11:36.144
Well, I assumed all that had changed

11:36.146 --> 11:40.190
when Black Lightning helped
those meta refugees escape.

11:40.192 --> 11:42.067
Face it, man, you're on our side now,

11:42.069 --> 11:43.272
whether you like it or not.

11:43.275 --> 11:46.212
No. No. Not if you're putting
innocent people in danger.

11:46.215 --> 11:49.032
Look, I already told you, man, I
don't get down with your methods.

11:49.034 --> 11:50.050
Whatever, bruh.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.227
That's not why I'm here.

11:55.891 --> 11:57.748
This is about Mrs. Shepard.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.203
She needs our help.

11:59.206 --> 12:00.710
Wait, Mrs. Shepard?

12:00.712 --> 12:02.372
- Our third-grade teacher?
- Mmm-hmm.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.065
What's going on?

12:05.067 --> 12:07.810
Well, apparently, when you
were getting those metas out,

12:07.812 --> 12:11.555
you injured the acting
ASA Director, Major Grey.

12:11.557 --> 12:14.784
And now that bastard,
Williams, is taking over

12:14.786 --> 12:16.985
and stepping up the occupation.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.913
Now, he's taken over your
old apartment building

12:18.915 --> 12:21.582
and using it as a
barracks for new troops.

12:21.584 --> 12:22.813
Franklin Terrace?

12:23.819 --> 12:25.912
Man, they don't know
what they're messing with.

12:26.488 --> 12:29.832
No, they don't know and they don't care.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.759
They've evicted all the tenants,

12:31.761 --> 12:33.761
and Mrs. Shepard is refusing to leave.

12:33.763 --> 12:36.121
Now, I sent some officers over
there to lock the place down

12:36.123 --> 12:39.600
until we could talk to her.
But we don't have a lot of time.

12:39.602 --> 12:42.711
Williams has given us until
nightfall to get her out.

12:42.713 --> 12:44.564
Otherwise, they're gonna
throw her out on the street.

12:44.566 --> 12:45.694
Let's go.

12:48.510 --> 12:49.759
Drink you some agua.

12:49.761 --> 12:51.445
- Thank you. Here.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:56.393 --> 12:59.453
Oof, some good stuff.

12:59.455 --> 13:02.272
Yeah, it's really what helps
keep my powers in check.

13:02.274 --> 13:04.574
Medicinal, as the old folks like to say.

13:06.278 --> 13:09.213
Okay. So, how did you get your powers?

13:10.800 --> 13:13.992
Um, I went to a party,

13:13.994 --> 13:16.711
and some guy slipped
Green Light in my drink.

13:16.714 --> 13:19.164
Damn. That's messed up.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.353
It is what it is.

13:21.125 --> 13:22.309
How about you?

13:25.783 --> 13:28.449
You remember when I told
you Dr. Jace killed my mom?

13:30.968 --> 13:32.569
Well, what I didn't tell you was

13:32.572 --> 13:34.655
that Dr. Jace was experimenting on her

13:34.657 --> 13:37.324
while she was pregnant with me.

13:37.326 --> 13:39.827
One of Jace's assistants felt
bad and helped her escape,

13:39.829 --> 13:41.579
but the damage had already been done.

13:43.546 --> 13:46.285
I watched my mother
slowly break down and die.

13:47.653 --> 13:49.861
She passed two days
before my tenth birthday.

13:51.841 --> 13:53.132
I'm really sorry, Brandon.

13:54.493 --> 13:57.122
Ah, it's cool. You didn't know.

13:58.681 --> 14:01.056
After that, they threw
me in foster care.

14:03.260 --> 14:06.186
But it was something Jace
did in those experiments

14:06.188 --> 14:08.856
that, like, helped me with my powers.

14:08.858 --> 14:11.766
So, as soon as I found out
that I could make diamonds,

14:11.769 --> 14:14.361
I ran away.

14:14.364 --> 14:16.745
I've been looking for
Dr. Jace ever since.

14:17.933 --> 14:19.658
And now you've come to
Freeland to kill her?

14:23.205 --> 14:24.997
Probably sound like a
terrible person, huh?

14:26.441 --> 14:29.209
No. No, actually I get it.

14:32.030 --> 14:33.436
You do?

14:33.439 --> 14:34.548
Yeah.

14:35.701 --> 14:37.885
Look, when Khalil was murdered,

14:37.887 --> 14:40.787
all I could think about was revenge.

14:40.789 --> 14:43.540
I wanted to kill the
person who did that to him.

14:43.542 --> 14:45.300
Make them suffer the way he suffered,

14:45.302 --> 14:46.518
and to be honest,

14:47.563 --> 14:48.777
I still do.

14:50.885 --> 14:52.232
Wow.

14:56.513 --> 14:59.019
You know, I haven't forgotten
about helping you find Jace.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.892
Don't worry about it.

15:02.894 --> 15:05.061
I don't think there is
anything you can do, anyway.

15:05.063 --> 15:07.710
Yeah, you're probably right.

15:08.850 --> 15:11.559
I guess I shouldn't tell you
her last known whereabouts then.

15:19.261 --> 15:20.929
- Nothing's changed.
- Unlock the door.

15:20.931 --> 15:22.468
- Let's go.
- I can't let you do that, sir.

15:22.470 --> 15:24.631
Fine. You don't want to unlock
the door, we'll break it down.

15:24.633 --> 15:25.915
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Battering ram.

15:25.917 --> 15:27.434
- Stat.
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

15:27.436 --> 15:29.268
Wait, wait, wait.

15:29.271 --> 15:30.437
Stop!

15:30.439 --> 15:31.816
Why is this building locked?

15:31.819 --> 15:34.587
I told you to have that
woman out of there by sundown.

15:34.590 --> 15:37.676
Just give us ten minutes to talk
to her. That's all, ten minutes.

15:37.679 --> 15:40.096
- You have five.
- You can't do this.

15:40.098 --> 15:42.149
You can't just evict
people out of their houses.

15:42.151 --> 15:44.618
Sacrifices must be made during war.

15:44.620 --> 15:48.271
These people are serving their
country, and it is about time.

15:48.273 --> 15:49.814
This isn't a war!

15:49.816 --> 15:51.250
It's an occupation.

15:51.252 --> 15:53.460
And the people are
getting sick and tired,

15:53.462 --> 15:54.927
and they're gonna rise up.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.660
I'd like to see them try...

15:58.876 --> 16:00.025
meta.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.467
Open the door.

16:02.454 --> 16:03.707
You have five minutes.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.470
Knock, knock.

16:26.737 --> 16:28.236
Who's there?

16:28.238 --> 16:30.718
Mrs. Shepard, it's Jefferson Pierce.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.051
Jefferson Pierce.

16:36.756 --> 16:38.672
Give me some sugar, baby.

16:38.674 --> 16:40.174
Oh!

16:42.011 --> 16:44.327
- Come on in.
- Okay.

16:44.329 --> 16:45.934
It's good to see you, Mrs. Shepard.

16:47.183 --> 16:49.850
- Wow, this place hasn't changed a bit.
- Mmm.

16:49.852 --> 16:52.496
Okay, I see you're
still selling this here.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.672
What? On a teacher's salary?

16:55.674 --> 16:57.841
Gotta earn a living somehow.

16:57.843 --> 16:59.342
Right.

16:59.344 --> 17:02.696
Hey, you remember when I hit
my ball through your window

17:02.698 --> 17:04.865
and broke one of your plants?

17:04.867 --> 17:08.910
Hmm, lucky. I should've
kicked your little ass.

17:10.856 --> 17:12.405
Yeah, okay.

17:14.526 --> 17:16.376
- Look, Mrs. Shepard...
- Ah-ah-ah.

17:18.789 --> 17:21.131
I've lived here for 45 years.

17:22.701 --> 17:24.325
This is my home.

17:24.327 --> 17:25.961
I'm not going anywhere.

17:25.963 --> 17:28.454
I understand that, but
it's just an apartment.

17:28.455 --> 17:30.223
It's not worth it.

17:30.226 --> 17:32.392
You disappoint me, Jefferson.

17:32.394 --> 17:36.254
You know better than
anyone what this means,

17:36.256 --> 17:38.357
what this place means.

17:39.885 --> 17:41.860
Look. Come.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.557
You see that street down there?

17:47.559 --> 17:50.077
That's where we had the
sit-in to get the right

17:50.079 --> 17:52.465
for colored folks to live here.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.087
You see that old hickory tree,

18:00.089 --> 18:02.586
the one you used to love to play under?

18:04.082 --> 18:07.852
That's where I met Obama
when he came to Freeland.

18:08.997 --> 18:11.707
He was so tall.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.154
This is more than just an apartment.

18:26.949 --> 18:29.782
This is... part of me.

18:29.785 --> 18:31.785
Part of our people.

18:31.787 --> 18:33.162
Have you forgotten that?

18:34.441 --> 18:37.025
No... no.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.708
They're gonna throw you out.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.576
They'll hurt you.

18:46.886 --> 18:49.658
Mrs. Shepard, please. This
is not a wise decision.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.182
I know that they hurt you.

18:55.644 --> 18:57.727
I saw the video.

18:57.730 --> 18:59.892
You chose not to fight back.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.892
This is my decision.

19:03.894 --> 19:06.486
- I'm staying.
- I hear you, I do.

19:06.488 --> 19:07.560
But I just...

19:07.563 --> 19:10.774
Things don't always happen
the way you want them to.

19:10.776 --> 19:14.644
Sometimes, you just have to
do what you know is right.

19:14.646 --> 19:17.918
And trust that you're in God's hands.

19:27.084 --> 19:28.305
Good-bye, Mrs. Shepard.

19:56.038 --> 19:58.872
- Yeah. Any luck?
- No.

19:58.874 --> 20:00.449
You need to rally your troops.

20:01.451 --> 20:02.937
We're making our stand.

20:02.940 --> 20:05.078
What do you mean, making our
stand? What're you talking about?

20:05.080 --> 20:07.547
What... Hello? Hello?

20:07.549 --> 20:09.907
Time's up. We're going in.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.109
Hey, wait. Hold on.

20:11.111 --> 20:13.077
Get that damn battering
ram up there now.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.378
Get back!

20:15.415 --> 20:16.598
What's going on?

20:16.600 --> 20:18.054
There's somebody else in there.

20:22.419 --> 20:24.047
On the count of three!

20:24.049 --> 20:25.649
One... two... thr...

20:58.958 --> 21:00.291
Good news.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.435
I may have footage.

21:01.437 --> 21:02.602
Any luck with the signal?

21:02.604 --> 21:05.105
Maybe, but it's gonna be a long shot.

21:05.107 --> 21:08.466
You see, the only thing capable
of generating a signal that strong

21:08.468 --> 21:10.018
is a radio tower.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.946
The ASA controls all the
towers currently in operation.

21:12.948 --> 21:16.104
But I found an old abandoned facility

21:16.107 --> 21:18.414
- in Baker Hills.
- All right, cool. I'll go with you.

21:18.417 --> 21:19.653
All units, be advised...

21:19.655 --> 21:22.302
10-33 in progress at the
corner of 8th and Lewis,

21:22.305 --> 21:23.898
Franklin Terrace Apartments.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.517
The fugitive known as Black Lightning

21:25.519 --> 21:28.111
is preventing ASA forces
from entering the building.

21:28.113 --> 21:30.192
Subject is considered
armed and dangerous...

21:30.195 --> 21:31.862
You go. I'll handle the tower.

21:33.243 --> 21:34.409
Wait, Anissa.

21:34.411 --> 21:35.691
Aren't you forgetting something?

21:39.499 --> 21:41.810
I think Thunder would go
better with Black Lightning.

21:42.862 --> 21:44.019
Don't you?

21:58.760 --> 22:01.495
Alpha Four. Do you copy?

22:01.497 --> 22:02.583
Copy.

22:02.586 --> 22:03.663
Got the flank?

22:13.182 --> 22:15.617
Affirmative. Alpha Four in position.

22:15.620 --> 22:17.094
On my signal...

22:19.914 --> 22:22.912
Sir, we really doing this?

22:22.915 --> 22:25.316
I mean, the old lady just
wants to stay in her apartment.

22:29.258 --> 22:30.623
Orders are orders.

22:30.626 --> 22:32.160
Engage target!

23:01.055 --> 23:04.682
Get back! Fall back! Fall back!

23:04.685 --> 23:05.890
Fall back!

23:13.709 --> 23:15.051
Took you long enough.

23:15.053 --> 23:16.268
Sorry for the delay.

23:17.222 --> 23:18.897
I had to pick up some friends.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.446
You out of your mind?

23:26.448 --> 23:28.439
Stand down! That's an order.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.227
I'm done taking orders from you.

23:34.239 --> 23:37.132
All right. Let's secure the
building, no one goes in or out.

23:37.134 --> 23:38.833
Henderson, check on Mrs. Shepard,

23:38.835 --> 23:40.181
make sure she's all right.

23:48.578 --> 23:50.794
This meta...

23:50.797 --> 23:53.523
just kicked your ass... bruh.

24:40.489 --> 24:41.763
Hello?

24:42.807 --> 24:44.051
Anyone there?

24:45.827 --> 24:47.061
Hello?

24:52.668 --> 24:53.834
Show yourself!

25:10.766 --> 25:11.893
Baron?

25:15.098 --> 25:16.189
How do you know my name?

25:17.526 --> 25:20.184
I used to work with Dr. Lynn Stewart.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.361
You're one of the pod kids.

25:22.364 --> 25:23.760
Oh, so you're ASA.

25:24.992 --> 25:26.724
Then get comfortable.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.309
You're gonna rot in there.

25:28.311 --> 25:29.725
Wait!

25:29.728 --> 25:30.869
Hold on.

25:30.872 --> 25:33.039
Baron, I'm not ASA.

25:33.041 --> 25:34.766
In fact, I'm trying
to get a message out,

25:34.768 --> 25:37.910
so people will know what the
ASA is doing here and send help.

25:37.912 --> 25:40.278
Hey, here. Look, look.

25:48.890 --> 25:51.707
I'm trying to connect
to the old antennae.

25:51.709 --> 25:54.292
If I was ASA, I'd just
use their system, right?

25:55.564 --> 25:56.730
Baron, please.

25:57.733 --> 25:59.342
We're on the same side.

25:59.345 --> 26:00.549
I promise.

26:03.720 --> 26:05.571
You really think people will help?

26:05.574 --> 26:07.063
I don't know.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.595
But if we don't do something,

26:08.598 --> 26:11.942
there's no telling how many more
kids the ASA will stick into pods.

27:27.972 --> 27:29.522
Dr. Stewart...

27:29.524 --> 27:30.732
thought you'd be back.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.975
Finally come to your
senses about the ASA?

27:32.977 --> 27:34.685
Yes, and you're gonna help me

27:34.687 --> 27:36.070
find a workaround, so they can't force

27:36.072 --> 27:37.688
the metas to be weapons.

27:37.690 --> 27:38.814
- Am I?
- Yes!

27:38.816 --> 27:40.413
You said so yourself.

27:40.416 --> 27:42.318
You've been working
with the ASA for decades,

27:42.320 --> 27:43.819
no one knows them better than you.

27:43.821 --> 27:45.505
There must be a way to stop them.

27:45.507 --> 27:47.841
There is one way, but
you're not gonna like it.

27:47.843 --> 27:48.978
What is it?

27:51.179 --> 27:52.912
You can break me out.

27:52.914 --> 27:54.831
Why in the world would I do that?

27:54.834 --> 27:57.750
You need my antibodies to
stabilize the metas, don't you?

27:57.752 --> 27:59.251
If the metas aren't stabilized,

27:59.253 --> 28:01.012
then the ASA can't weaponize them.

28:01.014 --> 28:03.189
So, you see, Dr. Stewart,

28:03.191 --> 28:04.599
I'm your golden goose.

28:04.601 --> 28:06.675
- I don't have access.
- You don't need access.

28:06.677 --> 28:08.511
The security, you wouldn't
be able to get through.

28:08.513 --> 28:10.638
Everything you need is on
that roster you gave me.

28:10.640 --> 28:13.516
I can't get out of here
with just my strength,

28:13.518 --> 28:16.451
but with camouflage, now
that's a different story.

28:18.564 --> 28:19.945
You're talking about Maryam.

28:20.733 --> 28:21.866
Mmm.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.334
She can only camouflage herself.

28:23.336 --> 28:24.394
Exactly.

28:24.397 --> 28:27.070
That's why you're gonna
give me her powers.

28:27.073 --> 28:29.215
I know you've been doing gene editing.

28:29.217 --> 28:31.885
There has to be a way
to isolate her genes

28:31.887 --> 28:33.553
and splice them into my DNA.

28:43.644 --> 28:45.060
Jace isn't in Freeland?

28:50.814 --> 28:52.989
She got snatched by the Markovians.

29:07.163 --> 29:08.713
I came all this way,

29:11.426 --> 29:12.867
and she's not even here.

29:17.199 --> 29:18.665
Brandon.

29:18.668 --> 29:21.749
I'm stuck inside the
perimeter with no way out.

29:23.045 --> 29:24.950
Brandon. Calm down.

29:24.953 --> 29:26.286
Brandon.

29:26.373 --> 29:27.590
Brandon.

29:27.592 --> 29:29.675
Brandon! Brandon! Oh, my God!

29:29.677 --> 29:31.218
Brandon, stop!

29:31.220 --> 29:32.386
Brandon!

29:32.388 --> 29:34.224
- No way out!
- Oh, God.

29:35.283 --> 29:37.178
Brandon. You're scaring me. Stop.

29:38.370 --> 29:39.855
Brandon, calm down.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.624
Brandon!

29:45.651 --> 29:47.221
Brandon! Brandon!

29:53.459 --> 29:56.219
Brandon. Brandon, get up.

29:57.663 --> 29:58.805
What happened?

29:58.807 --> 30:00.306
Oh, God.

30:00.308 --> 30:01.671
You had a power flare.

30:03.198 --> 30:04.407
A power what?

30:05.146 --> 30:06.554
A power flare, Brandon.

30:06.556 --> 30:10.549
It's... our powers are
connected to our emotions.

30:10.551 --> 30:11.825
So, when you get upset,

30:12.988 --> 30:14.661
it gets really hard to control them.

30:15.690 --> 30:16.952
Oh, my God.

30:17.993 --> 30:19.767
You okay?

30:19.769 --> 30:22.409
I'm fine. I'm just
happy you are all right.

30:24.482 --> 30:27.074
Honestly, this kind of thing
happens to me all the time.

30:27.076 --> 30:28.313
So...

30:28.316 --> 30:30.394
to watch it happen to
you makes me feel like...

30:31.506 --> 30:33.024
a little less of a freak.

30:35.251 --> 30:36.748
Oh, you're still a freak.

30:37.453 --> 30:38.994
Now we're just two freaks together.

30:41.415 --> 30:43.336
So, Baron, tell me...

30:44.853 --> 30:47.442
what's a young man like you
doing up here all by himself?

30:48.431 --> 30:50.506
It's my powers.

30:50.508 --> 30:52.448
I don't know how to
describe them. I can...

30:53.344 --> 30:55.173
I can talk to computers,

30:56.638 --> 30:58.138
machines.

31:00.535 --> 31:01.850
I can feel them...

31:03.229 --> 31:04.866
...hear their voices.

31:04.869 --> 31:06.497
So, you're a technopath.

31:08.356 --> 31:10.586
It started after I took that vaccine.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.904
That was 30 years ago.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.739
But when I came out of the pod,

31:15.741 --> 31:17.008
things had changed.

31:18.385 --> 31:20.052
All of these smart devices,

31:20.055 --> 31:22.416
they never, ever, ever stop talking.

31:23.558 --> 31:25.558
The noise was deafening.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.541
So, I came up here away from it all.

31:28.471 --> 31:30.212
So much had happened.

31:30.214 --> 31:33.232
I couldn't relate to anyone,
so I stayed in this tower

31:33.234 --> 31:34.828
with my machines.

31:36.404 --> 31:38.353
They're the only ones
that understand me.

31:39.574 --> 31:41.282
ASA called me a technocrat.

31:42.886 --> 31:44.619
Only thing I don't mind about them.

31:46.922 --> 31:48.088
I go by TC.

31:50.276 --> 31:52.293
Okay, TC it is then.

31:58.144 --> 31:59.703
What're you doing?

31:59.706 --> 32:01.285
They don't like it when you do that.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.595
You're hurting it.

32:02.597 --> 32:03.787
Here.

32:18.445 --> 32:20.687
All right. Now, you take this floor.

32:20.690 --> 32:23.023
Remember, watch the windows.

32:23.026 --> 32:24.117
Come on, come on.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.244
Go, go.

32:31.959 --> 32:35.785
Hmm. You remember me?

32:35.788 --> 32:38.947
You killed my friend,
you son of a bitch.

32:38.949 --> 32:40.772
You again.

32:40.775 --> 32:42.326
Cute suit.

33:41.711 --> 33:42.862
Come on.

33:57.545 --> 33:58.610
Khalil?

34:09.618 --> 34:11.297
Sir, the asset is down.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.375
What? How?

34:13.377 --> 34:15.561
Not sure. We're scanning his vitals.

34:15.563 --> 34:17.396
It will take some time...

34:17.398 --> 34:18.646
To hell with this.

34:20.926 --> 34:22.743
Sir...

34:22.746 --> 34:24.681
This ends now.

34:34.657 --> 34:35.956
Okay, we're almost ready.

34:36.984 --> 34:38.583
Hey, I'm here.

34:38.585 --> 34:40.129
It's okay, she's a friend.

34:40.819 --> 34:42.112
Did you get it?

34:42.114 --> 34:43.280
Everything is on here.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.775
Great. Thunder,

34:44.779 --> 34:47.074
this is TC. He's been helping
me get the signal up and running.

34:47.077 --> 34:48.089
I'll fill you in later.

34:48.092 --> 34:50.001
Right now, we have to
get this message out.

34:50.998 --> 34:52.246
All right, we're all set.

34:52.248 --> 34:54.458
Okay. Now, as soon as
we start broadcasting,

34:54.460 --> 34:56.601
the ASA is going to be able
to lock on to our signal.

34:56.605 --> 34:59.420
So, even though I'm bouncing
it off of the other towers,

34:59.423 --> 35:00.940
we don't have much time.

35:00.942 --> 35:02.472
- Ready?
- Ready.

35:02.475 --> 35:03.588
All right.

35:05.012 --> 35:06.946
This is Jamillah Olsen.

35:06.948 --> 35:09.106
Here's what you need to know.

35:09.108 --> 35:11.450
There's no SARS outbreak in Freeland.

35:11.452 --> 35:13.143
Government experiments

35:13.145 --> 35:15.354
have turned residents into meta-humans.

35:15.356 --> 35:18.532
And the ASA has rounded
up any suspected metas

35:18.534 --> 35:21.109
and put them in a detainment facility.

35:21.111 --> 35:23.278
Please share these images,

35:23.280 --> 35:24.463
call your representatives.

35:25.842 --> 35:27.483
What?

35:27.485 --> 35:29.863
Wait, no, no, no. No, no, no
What happened? Why'd it stop?

35:29.866 --> 35:31.662
The signal's jammed,
there's a second firewall.

35:31.664 --> 35:33.139
Move, move, move, move.

35:34.958 --> 35:37.809
You better hurry. They're
about to get a lock on us.

35:37.812 --> 35:39.190
Almost there.

35:39.193 --> 35:41.055
There's no time, We're
gonna have to abort.

35:41.057 --> 35:42.772
Wait, got it.

35:43.842 --> 35:47.343
- This is Jamillah...
- Oh, my God.

35:47.346 --> 35:49.888
Sorry. We were so close.

35:52.810 --> 35:54.327
Wait, wait, wait. Look. Wait, look.

35:54.329 --> 35:56.186
Look, look, look. Look, Look.

35:56.188 --> 35:58.906
- It went through.
- Look, it went through.

35:58.908 --> 36:00.706
It went through. It went through.

36:00.709 --> 36:02.168
Yes, it went through.

36:02.170 --> 36:03.324
All right.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.654
All right. It went through.

36:05.656 --> 36:06.747
Good job.

36:06.749 --> 36:07.965
Good job, Thunder.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.825
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

37:07.512 --> 37:09.078
- Gambi.
- Lynn.

37:09.081 --> 37:10.310
They're trying to lock you in.

37:10.313 --> 37:12.146
You have to get out of there, now.

37:12.148 --> 37:13.948
The Pit! Step on it!

37:13.950 --> 37:15.733
Wait, I'll just talk
to Commander Williams.

37:15.735 --> 37:16.793
You can't.

37:16.796 --> 37:18.652
Black Lightning just
joined the Resistance.

37:18.654 --> 37:21.402
The deal with the Pierce
family is officially off.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.157
If they can't throw
Jefferson in the Pit,

37:23.159 --> 37:24.992
the ASA will just keep you there.

37:24.994 --> 37:26.860
Use you as a bargaining chip.

37:26.862 --> 37:28.153
Damn it, Jeff!

37:28.155 --> 37:29.788
You have to go. I'll guide you.

37:29.790 --> 37:32.166
Okay, wait, wait. I
need to get the cure.

37:54.261 --> 37:55.596
Ready.

37:55.599 --> 37:58.002
All right, there's a
room across the hall. Go!

38:06.044 --> 38:08.729
Good. Now, go down the
hallway and stay low.

38:14.317 --> 38:16.052
Someone's coming. Quick, take cover.

38:23.167 --> 38:24.994
All right, it's all clear. Keep going.

38:28.305 --> 38:30.047
Almost there. Take the next hallway,

38:30.050 --> 38:32.508
and then there's an
elevator on your right.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.104
Wait! Go left, into the office.

38:35.689 --> 38:36.862
Hold your position,

38:36.865 --> 38:38.868
and get ready to make
a run for the elevator.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.440
Wait, Lynn, I said hold your position.

38:44.857 --> 38:46.643
Wait! Stop her!

38:50.988 --> 38:52.237
She has access.

38:52.239 --> 38:54.461
It was rescinded. Go!

38:59.079 --> 39:00.888
Hey, stop that elevator immediately.

39:06.086 --> 39:07.669
Come on, quickly. Get in.

39:07.671 --> 39:09.504
- No! My bag!
- Leave it, leave it.

39:09.506 --> 39:11.690
- Gambi, I need my bag! To get my bag!
- There's no time. No!

39:11.692 --> 39:13.525
- My bag!
- Drive!

39:13.528 --> 39:15.027
Oh, damn it.

39:15.029 --> 39:16.529
I need my bag.

39:16.531 --> 39:17.714
You'll be all right.

39:25.230 --> 39:26.330
This is nice.

39:35.383 --> 39:37.263
This is your final warning.

39:38.386 --> 39:40.213
Step down, meta-freak.

39:42.063 --> 39:44.712
This building belongs to
the people of Freeland.

39:45.468 --> 39:46.725
We ain't leaving.

39:46.727 --> 39:48.726
Fine.

39:48.729 --> 39:50.305
Then just die.

39:54.068 --> 39:55.913
You don't wanna dance with me.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.312
I have your powers

39:59.315 --> 40:02.232
and the finest tactical
training on Earth.

40:02.234 --> 40:03.733
Yeah, right.

40:03.736 --> 40:05.538
The thing is,

40:05.541 --> 40:07.596
you've got a lot of electricity coursing

40:07.599 --> 40:09.822
through your nervous system right now.

40:09.832 --> 40:13.478
I've got this suit to
protect me. You don't, meta.

40:13.481 --> 40:14.920
I see your point.

40:44.952 --> 40:47.036
Thank you, Black Lightning,

40:48.821 --> 40:50.955
for saving our home.

40:50.958 --> 40:52.291
My pleasure, ma'am.

40:52.293 --> 40:54.484
Now, if you'd excuse me,

40:54.486 --> 40:58.080
I think I'm gonna go check on my plants.

40:58.082 --> 41:00.716
There's been so much
going on that, um...

41:01.627 --> 41:02.927
I hope they're okay.

41:04.093 --> 41:05.346
Thank you.

41:09.310 --> 41:10.968
Same old Mrs. Shepard.

41:13.051 --> 41:14.788
Hey, thanks for your help back there.

41:16.008 --> 41:17.990
Now, those are methods I can get behind.

41:19.845 --> 41:23.155
Welcome to the Resistance,
Black Lightning.

41:25.892 --> 41:27.284
We took back the building.

41:28.737 --> 41:30.663
Now, let's take back our city.
